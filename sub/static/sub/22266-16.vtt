WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.163
OLIVER: <i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

00:03.253 --> 00:05.586
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.755
I'm recommending he be
transferred to a facility

00:07.841 --> 00:09.127
that can provide
the care that he needs.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.925
- Where's my dad?
- Have a seat.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.095
He's gonna be okay,
but I need to tell you about it.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.469
You wanna keep going,
or are you gonna testify?

00:20.395 --> 00:21.385
We're leaving.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.972
You've seen what having Felicity
in my life has done for me.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.729
You deserve that same
kind of happiness.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.856
I've located
the Heir of Ra's al Ghul.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.461
- So, where are we going?
- Wherever you want.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.045
It's up to me?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.874
I'm the well-traveled man. I've been
every place in the world there is.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.335
But you want to get out of here.

00:53.428 --> 00:57.388
Because if the police know
you're alive, they'll come after you.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.464
The Arrow, too.

00:58.642 --> 01:02.135
Yes. If someone knew where I was,

01:02.229 --> 01:05.346
it would be unfortunate
for both of us.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.477
So, why did you reach out to me?

01:07.568 --> 01:11.357
I don't want to hurt, or get hurt.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.527
Never again.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.027
I can teach you to be strong,
in heart and body.

01:15.117 --> 01:18.201
I can teach you to protect yourself,
so, no one will ever hurt you again.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.199
That's what every father
wants for his daughter.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.884
Malcolm Merlyn's legacy lives on.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.391
This is a new dawn.

01:45.689 --> 01:49.558
Al Sa-Her was going to bestow on us
a new golden age,

01:49.651 --> 01:52.940
and lead us into
the realm of Thanatos.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.281
Yet for what greatness
Merlyn possessed in his soul,

01:59.119 --> 02:01.111
he lost in his heart.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.372
He swore that our great journey
would be nothing

02:04.458 --> 02:06.666
without his blood legacy at our side.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.411
And thus, before he gave up his life,

02:09.880 --> 02:12.588
he made sure this journey
could not commence

02:12.674 --> 02:14.836
until his beloved was ready.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.679
Step forward.

02:29.399 --> 02:34.190
I have to say,
the new uniforms do not impress me.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.318
We've cleansed ourselves
of your father's sins

02:38.408 --> 02:42.493
for our rebirth, which couldn't be
further from your fate,

02:42.579 --> 02:44.696
daughter of the Demon.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.534
I would so relish
slitting your throat, Athena.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.955
One thing we have in common.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.880
Except I've grown a taste
for the contemporary.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.879
Such as plastic explosives.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.581
Oh, my gosh!

03:36.675 --> 03:39.338
You'd be in so much trouble
if your dad saw you doing that.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.715
You're lucky
you have such a cool aunt.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.047
You know,
who approves of bad behavior.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.350
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.928
Just promise me that you're gonna
watch over your dad, okay?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.011
But he is the Green Arrow.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.768
You know,
before he was the Green Arrow,

03:52.858 --> 03:54.850
he actually used to be
really afraid of the dark

03:54.943 --> 03:58.527
and he needed a night light
in his bedroom till he was what, 16?

03:58.613 --> 04:02.197
It was not a night...
It was not a night light.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.321
I couldn't sleep
with it being pitch-black.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.245
By the way, I did see that.
Go get a fork and a plate,

04:07.330 --> 04:09.287
and get yourself
a reasonable slice of cake.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.327
Yes!

04:11.585 --> 04:15.920
Thank you for doing this.
It's actually pretty cool.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.375
Why do you sound surprised?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.916
I don't know.
I just thought that maybe,

04:21.011 --> 04:23.469
you'd be a little more anti me going.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.672
I'm the one who encouraged you
to go follow your heart.

04:25.766 --> 04:30.181
I know, I know. It's just that,
now, that it's all real, I just...

04:30.270 --> 04:33.388
I thought that maybe, you'd be like
a tad less supportive.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.809
I'm completely supportive

04:34.900 --> 04:37.267
of anything and everything
that makes you happy.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.941
Speaking of which, I did tell Roy
that the two times that I shot him

04:41.031 --> 04:43.523
with arrows would be nothing
compared to what would happen to him

04:43.617 --> 04:45.654
if you end up unhappy.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

04:45.744 --> 04:48.202
- Yeah.
- I spy an overbearing big brother.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.450
Again, no, no,
he's never been like that.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.530
Never?

04:52.751 --> 04:54.834
I know we've said it a million times
but we're gonna miss you,

04:54.920 --> 04:57.162
we're really gonna miss you.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.338
You guys have to come visit us
once we find where we're gonna land.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.881
Where do we think
that's going to be?

05:01.051 --> 05:05.011
We don't really know exactly,
but that's kind of the best part.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.009
I mean, we're gonna figure it out
as we go along.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.637
That's so spontaneous and romantic.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.014
As long as we're together, that's
really all that matters, right?

05:14.731 --> 05:15.847
So, how's your new roommate?

05:15.941 --> 05:17.933
She's just as messy as my Laurel,

05:18.026 --> 05:20.313
but surprisingly,
she's a better cook.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.812
You trust her, Lance?

05:22.906 --> 05:25.694
I'm not stupid, you know. I know
who she is, I know what she's done.

05:25.784 --> 05:29.243
But she says
she's trying to get better,

05:29.329 --> 05:33.494
and, well, that intel
she gave you last week on Diaz,

05:33.583 --> 05:34.790
that panned out.

05:34.876 --> 05:38.369
- Yeah. He still got away.
- Don't they always, though?

05:38.463 --> 05:42.082
I'm sensing
a work conversation, so...

05:42.175 --> 05:43.586
Where are we with the SCPD?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.543
Well, Dinah and Curtis,

05:45.637 --> 05:47.754
they are growing a list of
possible cops on the take,

05:47.848 --> 05:49.555
but that could end up being
the least of our worries.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.475
- How so?
- The DA's office refusal

05:52.561 --> 05:54.473
to drop your case
without Roy's testimony,

05:54.563 --> 05:55.804
that doesn't sit right with me.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.479
And who's to say that the SCPD

05:57.566 --> 05:59.432
is the only part
of the city's power structure

05:59.526 --> 06:01.142
that Diaz has got his fingers in.

06:01.236 --> 06:04.229
Yeah. Oliver,
you let me worry about Diaz.

06:04.322 --> 06:05.813
You spend a little more time
with your sister

06:05.907 --> 06:07.068
before she gets out of here.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.574
And you think this guy's gonna

06:08.660 --> 06:10.367
stop worrying about things
all of a sudden?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.278
Well, ever since
he trusted me to take over.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.538
If that's still on the table.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.783
I'm gonna go, grab some cake.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.751
You brought this up last week.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.207
I don't know, man.

06:24.301 --> 06:28.215
I thought we were clear,
you wanted out, I wanted in.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.092
- Has something changed?
- Yeah.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.097
Yeah, it's just you and me.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.847
And we don't know
what Diaz has, what he doesn't.

06:35.937 --> 06:40.978
And bottom line, I don't think
that it should be just you.

06:46.323 --> 06:49.566
This is definitely one of the jerks
who beat Roy to a pulp last week.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.152
I wonder what food they're serving
at Thea and Roy's goodbye party.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.613
Pizza, apps,

06:56.041 --> 06:58.249
maybe like some mini-desserts,
that's this new thing.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.167
Like you go to a party
and then they serve you

07:00.253 --> 07:02.290
these desserts like mini-donuts,
and you just dip them in the sauce.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.712
That would be reason enough
to crash a party,

07:03.798 --> 07:05.881
not that I'm saying we crash a party.
I'm not expecting to be invited,

07:05.967 --> 07:09.426
- but Felicity's my business partner...
- Curtis, focus.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.253
We need to find out
how many of these cops are dirty.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.094
- Well, Officer Hester makes ten.
- Yeah, and counting.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.634
The more cops who are dirty,

07:16.728 --> 07:18.685
the harder it is to believe
Captain Hill didn't know.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.845
Who's next?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.561
Nick Anastas.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.944
More like hot Anastas. Wow.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.354
Just because
you've the hots for him

07:28.448 --> 07:30.155
doesn't mean
he's not on Diaz's payroll.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.607
All his stats check out.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.909
He doesn't have any influxes of cash
into his account,

07:33.995 --> 07:35.361
or pressure points for blackmail.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.788
Look, I'm just saying
you never mentioned to me,

07:37.874 --> 07:40.742
that you worked
with such a hot police officer.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.126
Not even once.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.661
I guess I never noticed.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.293
Yeah, just like you don't notice
beautiful sunsets and rainbows.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.795
You just don't. You see, beauty is...

07:49.052 --> 07:51.169
Hey, Z. How's school?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.846
- Good. Hi, Dinah.
- What's up, Zoe?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.673
Feeling like
some mac and cheese tonight?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.601
- Again?
- Can you get sick of mac and cheese?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.223
Definitely getting there.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.439
- Come on.
- Going to my room to do homework.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.353
(CHUCKLING)

08:06.569 --> 08:08.276
You two seem to be
getting along well.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.071
Yeah. It's almost nice, having
a little Munchkin around.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.867
I'm sure Rene appreciates somebody
he trusts taking care of her.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.077
Yeah, you know,
he should be starting rehab soon.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.238
Hopefully, he'll be
back to normal ASAP.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.870
- I really, really miss that guy.
- Me, too.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.452
- (CELL PHONE CHIMING)
- Hey, it's your boyfriend. Anastas.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.666
Homicide, gotta go.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.965
You keep digging. I got to find out
who at work I can trust.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.917
He's not my boyfriend yet.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.385
I'm on it.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.768
I can't believe
we're actually doing it.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.304
Yeah, I can't believe it, either.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.723
Happily ever after.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.897
Yeah, ever after.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.364
- Okay, that wasn't so convincing.
- Hey, I'm thrilled.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.487
I just... I don't wanna jinx it.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.411
Okay, since when
do you believe in superstitions?

08:58.621 --> 09:01.910
Well, ever since I met your brother,
there's not a lot I don't believe in.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.662
- (LOUD THUDDING)
- (TIRES SCREECHING)

09:10.967 --> 09:12.924
Okay, now, I may believe it, too.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.298
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.516
Please tell me you've packed
some weapon somewhere.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.597
Follow me! Hurry!

09:29.944 --> 09:31.401
Nyssa, what...

09:31.488 --> 09:33.445
- What is going on?
- We need to move.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.194
- What, are there more coming?
- Many more, these were the scouts.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.025
They look like
the League of Assassins.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.907
No, the League of Assassins
was disbanded, this can't be them.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.364
Nothing stays dead forever.
Your father made sure of that.

09:43.458 --> 09:47.828
Okay, well, I don't care.
I'm sorry, this is not me anymore.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.787
I've nothing to do with this.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.749
Like me, you are
an Heiress to the Demon.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.050
That is something
you can never truly run from.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.349
Hey, what happened?

10:06.439 --> 10:09.807
- Thea, are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine, I'm okay.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.601
I'm doing pretty fine myself,
thanks for asking.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.527
They weren't even out of city limits
and they got attacked.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.402
- It's because she jinxed it.
- Superstition played no part.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.821
I hear you've taken my husband
as your own.

10:20.537 --> 10:24.451
Yeah. Well,
we can talk about that later.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.329
In the League, such talk would take
the form of mortal combat.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.534
What the hell is going on?

10:28.628 --> 10:32.087
Apparently, my dear old dad decided
to recruit some loyalists

10:32.173 --> 10:35.666
- before Nyssa disbanded the League.
- For what?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.503
To start his own. The Thanatos Guild.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.383
Began hearing whispers
about them shortly

10:40.473 --> 10:41.964
after we all returned from Lian Yu.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.048
He couldn't have lived for long

10:43.143 --> 10:44.304
considering he didn't
leave the island.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.182
Moses never entered the Holy Land,
and yet, his legacy endured.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.764
His second-in-command,
Athena, took charge.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.815
A contemporary of mine, and a rival.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.319
Her involvement alone suggests
a very dark purpose at work here.

10:55.405 --> 10:58.364
Why would this Guild attack Thea?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.532
Before Merlyn gave up his life,

11:00.618 --> 11:04.407
he discovered a map that leads
to something ancient. Powerful.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.487
I do not know what it is,

11:05.582 --> 11:07.198
but I do know
that he yearned for Thea

11:07.292 --> 11:08.954
to be at his side
when he unearthed it.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.909
It's really funny
he never mentioned this.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.085
Because he knew you were not ready.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.289
Athena believes Thea to
either be in possession of the map,

11:15.383 --> 11:17.670
or at the very least have knowledge
of its whereabouts.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.545
Well, you have fun
on your treasure hunt, okay?

11:20.722 --> 11:22.839
I told you, you cannot run from this.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.808
Watch me, okay?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.308
Roy and I are getting out of here
and back to our lives.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.888
I need your help obtaining the map.

11:31.232 --> 11:35.146
You cannot deny your father's legacy
any more than I can deny mine.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.606
They will find you.

11:36.821 --> 11:37.982
What do you want from me?

11:38.072 --> 11:40.234
Merlyn had an associate in Star City.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.817
If he shared the map's location with
anyone, it would've been with her.

11:42.911 --> 11:43.901
You haven't spoken to her?

11:43.995 --> 11:47.113
She does not care for me.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.238
(SCOFFS)

11:49.709 --> 11:50.699
(COUGHS)

11:50.960 --> 11:54.078
But she would not deny
Merlyn's daughter.

11:56.049 --> 12:00.168
Okay, fine.
I'll go with you to talk to her,

12:00.261 --> 12:02.878
we'll help you find your map.

12:03.139 --> 12:07.133
And then, that's it.
I'm done for real this time.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.805
Drug deal gone bad.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.357
Very bad. The man was shot
over a dozen times.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.402
Maybe he pissed off the competition.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.403
I'll take it from here,
Lieutenant Drake.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.569
Captain, this is
a drug-related homicide.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.025
Isn't it a little below
your pay grade?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.280
It's part of a larger
sting operation.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.532
I wasn't aware of a larger...

12:27.622 --> 12:30.410
You aren't aware because it's
above your pay grade, Lieutenant.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.747
Well, we'll head back
to the station, then.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.961
Hey. You can leave the evidence
with me.

12:45.390 --> 12:46.380
Of course.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.365
Now, I see why
you didn't want the boys to come.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.988
That is Tigressa.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.245
Looks like the only thing
she knows how to kill is vodka.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.542
She has over 200 confirmed kills.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.205
One of them being her own brother
because he matched her quote.

13:25.555 --> 13:26.545
Al Ghul.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.970
I should take your hand
for what you did to Al Sa-Her.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.894
I never understood
your affection for Merlyn, Tigressa.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.604
But I always respected it.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.482
- This is...
- His spawn.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.569
You think I wouldn't recognize
Malcolm's own blood?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.022
Your father had much faith in you.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.984
Yeah, well, but that new league
he created running around,

13:48.077 --> 13:49.488
I can't say the same for him.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.411
So, you've met Athena.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.574
She is not the leader
your father desired. You are.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.750
Yeah. Well, I'm sure death has
cured him of his disappointment.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.377
Look, the only reason
why we are here is because

14:02.467 --> 14:05.631
Athena thinks
I can open some map for her.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.928
And with good reason.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.005
Your father made sure
you were the only one

14:10.099 --> 14:12.307
that could actually
unlock its secrets.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.010
Of course, he did.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.312
And that is why Athena needs you.

14:19.734 --> 14:24.820
Your father secretted the map...

14:25.990 --> 14:26.980
Here.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.237
And why didn't you just take it?

14:31.662 --> 14:36.748
I rejected the path of the League
of Assassins a long time ago.

14:37.210 --> 14:41.796
One day, you're gonna have to tell me
how you did that. Thank you for this.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.297
When you find it,
you may not be so grateful.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.128
I was being polite.

14:48.221 --> 14:52.135
We should contact your brother.
There's safety in numbers.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.429
Overwatch, are you sure
we're alone here?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.354
Yes, it's just the five of you.
No other souls for two blocks.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.813
Copy.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.606
Be cautious. Merlyn would have
laid traps to protect this place.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.024
What kind of traps
are we talking here?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.531
Are we talking <i>Raiders</i>
or <i>Temple of Doom</i> kind of traps?

15:12.620 --> 15:15.533
- You okay?
- I will be once this is all over.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.613
Yeah, me, too.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.240
NYSSA: Get down!

15:21.337 --> 15:24.045
A trap. Excellent.

15:24.132 --> 15:27.250
- "Excellent"?
- We must be close.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.048
JOHN: Thermal imaging is showing

15:31.139 --> 15:32.675
that what we're looking at
is what we've got.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.051
No hallways, no doors.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.008
Malcolm had a secret chamber
in his office.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.389
He might have something here.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.303
Clever.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.356
(SIZZLING)

15:49.240 --> 15:52.153
Iodide diazonium.
A component magnetically attracted

15:52.243 --> 15:55.281
to the same type of steel
my father used to encase relics.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.013
Okay. That's not a map.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.013
The map is inside.
It's an ancient League cipher.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.725
- Does it need a code?
- Try my birthday.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.521
Eighteen digits across,
three alphabets.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.395
Okay, so, it's not my birthday.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.395
NYSSA: Tigressa.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.574
Guys, about you being
the only souls for two blocks.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.070
Funny thing about those ninjas.

16:35.244 --> 16:39.454
I want Al Sa-Her's daughter,
and the map.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.874
I'm always merciful
when I get what I want.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.743
I know you better than that.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.080
Stand down. I'm not gonna ask twice.

16:55.765 --> 16:56.926
Come with us,

16:57.016 --> 16:59.429
and we'll let your friends
continue to draw breath.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.353
Stay where you are,
and blood will be shed.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.101
We'll go with shedding blood.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.186
Except, it'll be yours.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.364
Take this someplace safe. Go.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.988
Exit's kind of blocked right now.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.660
We can help with that.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.630
You've had the same footwork
since you were eight years old.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.310
Thea!

17:58.411 --> 18:01.245
Held my own. Barely. Let's go.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.010
Make your father proud.
Come with us.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.013
Felicity, I know
you were wondering.

18:25.438 --> 18:29.523
It's from <i>Raiders...</i> Kiss the floor.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.525
<i>I've got Thea and the map.</i>

18:36.616 --> 18:37.823
Let's move.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.249
Here, let me help you.

18:48.336 --> 18:52.546
Okay. God, that bitch
has a really powerful kick.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.669
I think she might have broken
one of my ribs.

18:54.759 --> 18:57.172
I assure you, that will be
the last time you have to face her.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.093
Yeah, you'll get
no complaints from me.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.763
This Athena doesn't seem like
the type who'd give up easily.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.182
I intend to take the choice
out of her hands

19:04.352 --> 19:06.184
by taking Merlyn's map far from here.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.929
I know the toll
a father can have on a child.

19:09.106 --> 19:12.315
Even long after he's gone.
This is my burden, not yours.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.527
You didn't tell me that this
was the box from <i>Hellraiser.</i>

19:15.613 --> 19:16.774
Take care of each other.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.563
That was a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.615
Okay, wait. Now, how're you
gonna open it?

19:20.701 --> 19:23.114
I'll find someone
who can unlock the cipher.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.161
My people invented
mathematics after all.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.330
Yeah, no, no, no.
Not this type of mathematics.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.327
Wait. Look, you can't
go out there by yourself.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.036
Not with Athena's assassins
looking for you.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.746
She said that's what
she wanted to do, Thea.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.127
- Yeah, it's not what I want.
- Speedy.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.676
You made it clear
once I acquired the map,

19:39.762 --> 19:42.425
you'd have no interest
in your father or the League.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.349
And you made it clear that this map,
it leads, to what,

19:45.434 --> 19:47.471
something ancient and powerful?

19:47.561 --> 19:51.054
Okay, you cannot take this on
by yourself.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.351
Plus, we have the world's
greatest mathematician right there.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.611
And the protection
that you're gonna need

19:58.698 --> 20:01.065
to keep that thing safe,
while you try to open it...

20:01.158 --> 20:03.616
I appreciate the gesture.

20:04.954 --> 20:05.944
Can you do it?

20:06.038 --> 20:09.372
Well, in my experience,
anything locked can be hacked.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.199
Usually, by me.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.749
Thea, are you sure about this?

20:14.839 --> 20:15.829
Nyssa's right.

20:16.090 --> 20:19.333
You did say that you wanted
nothing to do with Malcolm's legacy.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.463
I know, okay.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.591
Look, I can't believe
that I'm even saying this,

20:26.016 --> 20:29.054
but after
seeing those assassins, I...

20:29.937 --> 20:32.520
This all just became too real.

20:32.690 --> 20:35.023
Nyssa gave you an out.
I don't know why you don't take it.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.314
I don't know how to explain it to you
right now, okay.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.738
I just... I need you to trust me.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.658
All right, you ready?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.408
To go to prison for stealing
evidence? No, not really.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.989
I'm doing the stealing,
you're doing the hacking.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.454
Something tells me the police
don't make that distinction.

20:57.173 --> 21:00.883
This could be the last time I'm here,
not as a suspect.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.584
Okay, but how long
is this gonna take?

21:03.929 --> 21:08.799
- My worry is 25 to life.
- Come on.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.386
- Okay, keep watch.
- What!

21:12.480 --> 21:13.971
I thought you said
no one else is gonna be here.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.848
We are here, aren't we?

21:22.072 --> 21:23.404
DINAH DRAKE: This might take a while.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.232
(DOOR CLOSES)

21:26.619 --> 21:27.609
Crap.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.698
Come on.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.078
This is police access only.
What're you doing here?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.418
Nick Anastas! Hey!

21:38.088 --> 21:41.752
- It has been a while.
- Do I know you?

21:42.384 --> 21:46.594
Yes, of course. Curtis Holt.
We met through Dinah Drake.

21:46.680 --> 21:51.220
She's my friend and your Sergeant or
Lieutenant, or was it just Detective?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.893
Either way,
I'm meeting her here for dinner,

21:53.979 --> 21:57.939
but I kind of got lost
in this new building.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.861
I mean, I really haven't seen
this place since it was blown up.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.404
I can give you a tour if you want,

22:04.490 --> 22:06.447
while you're waiting
for Lieutenant Drake.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.821
She usually doesn't show up
for her shift for another hour.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.412
Totally Dinah. She's a major slacker.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.741
- Come on.
- Yeah.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.921
Gotcha.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.268
- Nyssa.
- Husband.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.846
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

22:38.023 --> 22:39.309
You got to stop doing that.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.393
I do have a wife now,

22:43.946 --> 22:45.482
and she doesn't like it.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.189
But that's the fun of it.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.776
Thea might want you to stay,

22:53.581 --> 22:54.742
doesn't mean you have to.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.245
The point about Felicity's utility
was well taken.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.246
So was her point about wanting
nothing to do with Malcolm.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.202
It's her life
and she must find her own truth.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.839
I think her truth is a new life,
that she's earned.

23:05.009 --> 23:08.628
She's earned your support for
her actions, whatever those may be.

23:08.971 --> 23:11.634
I can understand why she would be
conflicted with Malcolm.

23:11.807 --> 23:15.391
He was her father.
I am not conflicted. He was evil.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.970
And Thea should not be charged
with righting his wrongs.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.976
My father was also evil.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.309
And I've dedicated the rest of
my life to righting his wrongs.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.146
From what I understand,
you've done the same.

23:27.239 --> 23:32.030
But my father asked me to.
With his dying wish, he asked me to.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.532
Back on Lian Yu,
Merlyn gave up his life for Thea,

23:34.622 --> 23:36.955
just as your father did for you.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.374
I believe
Thea owes him the same debt.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.328
Well, it is convenient for you
to believe that.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.084
Because Thea gets you closer
to what you want.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.713
So, do not pretend that
you're selflessly supporting her.

23:48.844 --> 23:53.964
And never ever lecture me
on what I owe my sister.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.141
- If you think I would...
- FELICITY: Nailed it!

23:58.646 --> 23:59.887
I nailed it, I got it.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.892
- You've unlocked the map?
- No.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.314
Okay, so,
what do you mean by "nailed it"?

24:03.400 --> 24:06.017
I figured out how to unlock
the <i>Hellraiser</i> cube,

24:06.111 --> 24:07.522
but I just thought
you should do the honors.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.441
You've heard of the
Fibonacci sequence, right?

24:09.531 --> 24:10.738
Let's assume not.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.861
Fibonacci sequence
is a mathematical pattern

24:12.952 --> 24:16.741
dating back
to Pingala's formula in 450 B.C.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.820
- ROY: Wow.
- Yeah.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.497
When you said "ancient,"
you were not kidding.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.573
I never kid.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.250
Except where my marriage
is concerned, apparently.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.458
The Fibonacci sequence.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.039
Every number is the sum
of the two previous numbers,

24:28.175 --> 24:31.259
so, finding the two starting ones,
that's the tricky part.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.586
What are the starting numbers?

24:32.972 --> 24:35.009
- Ten and thirteen.
- Is she right?

24:35.099 --> 24:37.091
1013 was the year
the League was founded.

24:37.184 --> 24:40.268
- And Malcolm's birthday.
- Okay, sit.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.979
Try 10, 13, 23.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.892
- Thirty-six.
- Fifty-nine.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.023
Ninety-five.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.897
- I was always good at math.
- That's right.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.111
(CLINKING)

25:00.040 --> 25:01.030
Hmm.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.665
What does it say?

25:13.387 --> 25:15.879
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

25:17.641 --> 25:18.631
(SIGHS)

25:24.898 --> 25:26.890
Why're you burning it?

25:26.984 --> 25:28.600
She's heating it.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.562
The League writes in hidden text that
can only be revealed through flame.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.782
- You don't remember?
- I don't want to.

25:38.912 --> 25:43.657
I don't know what's going on with
him, but just keep working on it.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.622
- Why isn't the flame working?
- There's two possibilities for that.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.205
Either Malcolm was using
a different type of invisible ink...

25:50.299 --> 25:51.460
Or?

25:51.550 --> 25:54.088
Or there's nothing on this
and we're wasting our time.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.252
What's this?

25:57.139 --> 25:59.176
I thought since old-school wasn't
working, I'd try some new-school.

25:59.266 --> 26:03.180
The scanner can make
a 3-D voxel-based recreation.

26:03.353 --> 26:05.936
I didn't start using a computer
until I was 25.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.354
That explains a lot.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.770
If I can duplicate the map digitally,

26:13.864 --> 26:16.026
there might be some hidden markers
on there that we can trace.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.947
- Sounds complicated.
- It is. Very.

26:22.915 --> 26:27.455
So, it would be really great
to not be distracted, you know.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.752
Very true.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.964
I'll stay here to make sure
you remain uninterrupted...

26:33.300 --> 26:36.793
- Sister-wife.
- Okay.

26:41.850 --> 26:46.060
Okay, so, somebody is grumpy.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.889
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to be supportive.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.348
But?

26:50.442 --> 26:54.106
But I don't understand why you think
that this is your responsibility.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.812
He died for me.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.399
Okay? I don't know what it is,

26:59.493 --> 27:01.906
but ever since
I found out about this, I just...

27:04.081 --> 27:06.323
I feel like
I can't run away from it yet.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.784
No, you see,
that's where we are different.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.540
You see this
as us running away from something,

27:11.630 --> 27:14.373
but I see this
as us running towards something.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.582
Something way better.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.464
You know just, I don't know.
I just feel like

27:18.637 --> 27:20.799
recently, you've just been finding
any excuse you can

27:20.889 --> 27:22.130
for us to stay here.

27:22.516 --> 27:25.099
Unlike all my boyfriends in the past,

27:26.436 --> 27:30.180
I do find it kind of cute
when you're being insecure.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.146
I just don't wanna
lose you again, Thea.

27:36.780 --> 27:40.194
That map is not my future.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.162
You are.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.582
I love a good old murder board.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.295
Yeah. Feeling very Alan J. Pakula.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.346
Sometimes, I forget
you're not Felicity.

28:04.558 --> 28:08.268
Now, look. I know this has probably
already occurred to you,

28:08.353 --> 28:11.187
but all Hill did was
take the evidence from your hands.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.014
That's not necessarily proof.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.190
Not to mention,
her name did not pop up...

28:15.277 --> 28:18.520
- She's dirty.
- Are you asking me, or telling me?

28:18.614 --> 28:21.357
You tell me if these drugs
are the same kind Diaz pushes...

28:21.450 --> 28:24.113
If Hill took it off your hands,
that would be pretty damning.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.490
And the fact that so much
of this department is so crooked,

28:26.580 --> 28:30.620
would make a lot more sense
if it was rotten from the top down.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.700
So, are they Diaz's drugs?

28:32.794 --> 28:35.662
I don't know yet.
Maybe we should just try it.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.039
Or we can read the analysis.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.426
- Oh.
- What?

28:45.515 --> 28:47.882
- It's Vertigo.
- Vertigo?

28:47.976 --> 28:51.265
I heard of this back in Central City.
It's a hallucinogenic, right?

28:51.355 --> 28:55.019
Yeah, but the good thing is that
this isn't Diaz's drug of choice.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.601
- So, Hill is clean.
- Looks like.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.737
You actually look disappointed.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.782
Well, because it means
we're back to square one.

29:04.910 --> 29:05.900
Yeah.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.535
Thinking about
taking that thing with you?

29:11.625 --> 29:13.833
(SIGHS) One hundred percent no.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.959
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

29:19.675 --> 29:21.462
I mean, Roy only thinks
I'm gonna leave him

29:21.551 --> 29:24.168
and a bunch of crazy assassins
that my dead dad organized

29:24.263 --> 29:28.348
are trying to kill me,
so, my life is just great.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.221
You know, Thea,
you don't have to do this.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.268
You don't have to leave
everything to Nyssa.

29:33.438 --> 29:37.307
Myself, and John and Felicity,
we will stop Athena.

29:38.819 --> 29:43.405
You can go, you can live
your happily ever after with Roy.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.490
Here, I thought
you were supposed to go live yours.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.533
Felicity, she told me you stopped
being the Green Arrow.

29:52.416 --> 29:57.002
Yeah, that was the plan.
Life interfered.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.791
- John got hurt.
- He did.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.172
But he's not hurt anymore.

30:01.758 --> 30:05.047
I worry that he would be
in over his head,

30:05.137 --> 30:06.503
going up against Diaz alone.

30:06.596 --> 30:09.339
I don't think anything's
over John's head.

30:09.933 --> 30:14.177
You might be right.
I don't know, I...

30:15.939 --> 30:19.603
I gave it up because
I wanted to be a better father.

30:19.776 --> 30:25.397
But William accepts the idea
that I'm the Green Arrow.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.733
Plus, I don't want to give it up.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.738
- I don't know why.
- I do.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.534
Because being the Green Arrow
is what makes you feel complete.

30:38.920 --> 30:43.665
For some reason, when you put that
hood on, it enables you

30:43.759 --> 30:46.342
to become
the best version of yourself.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.507
We're supposed to be
talking about you.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.344
Maybe we are.
I don't know.

30:54.019 --> 30:58.263
Maybe that's the reason why I can't
seem to give this life up. I...

31:00.567 --> 31:05.278
I don't know, maybe I'm hoping that
somehow, I'll get the same thing,

31:06.948 --> 31:11.659
and find the best version of myself,
whoever she is.

31:12.746 --> 31:15.910
Athena's group of assassins,
found them.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.251
- Where are they?
- Star City gas plant.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.795
It holds the city's entire supply.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.747
- At worst, they could blow it up.
- Why?

31:24.841 --> 31:25.831
It's not their MO.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.042
It is if they're using the plant

31:27.135 --> 31:28.671
to leverage us
into giving up the map.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.503
Clearly, Athena
doesn't know you very well.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.840
Yeah, too bad it's not
Ollie's choice. It's mine.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.175
You can't give in to them.

31:35.268 --> 31:39.353
I can't let them hold the city
hostage, okay. This is still my home.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.057
So, what, am I going alone?

31:50.492 --> 31:52.859
Overwatch,
you have eyes on the Guild?

31:53.995 --> 31:55.611
No, not yet, but I'm reading
a frequency spike,

31:55.705 --> 31:57.071
which means
they just activated a bomb.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.373
Athena's way of putting pressure
on our negotiations.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.916
Fan out and find the bomb.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.789
Multiple heat signatures.
Guys, they got you surrounded.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.586
Head on a swivel.

32:04.798 --> 32:08.132
- Where are the new assassins?
- Everywhere.

32:09.136 --> 32:12.755
You want your map so bad? Come out.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.343
Let's talk.

32:19.563 --> 32:23.022
ATHENA: Perhaps your father taught you
some sense after all.

32:23.108 --> 32:27.728
But you're mistaken if you think
that all we want is the map.

32:31.825 --> 32:35.614
The map is meaningless
without spilling your blood.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.826
You're really starting
to piss me off.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.426
Your father spoke often
about you.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.602
He was always ashamed
of your weakness.

33:04.900 --> 33:05.890
(GRUNTS)

33:20.040 --> 33:21.952
Don't forget, guys,
we still have a bomb situation.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.666
There's always a bomb situation.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.369
I can trace the frequency root
of the detonator,

33:26.463 --> 33:27.499
it is 17 feet to your right.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.127
- Lead the way.
- FELICITY: <i>Up.</i>

33:39.184 --> 33:41.676
Merlyn said
he tried to teach you to be strong.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.016
- Clearly, he failed.
- I'm not my father.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.189
This isn't working.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.226
I know. It's a collapsible circuit.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.644
I can freeze it.
I have done it before.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.981
No! No, it's a mercury switch.
That will definitely set it off.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.111
What do I do?

33:57.536 --> 33:58.526
Short-circuit it.

33:58.620 --> 34:01.203
I'm out of electricity arrows
right now at the moment, Felicity.

34:01.748 --> 34:02.738
FELICITY: <i>Green Arrow?</i>

34:05.460 --> 34:07.247
On its way!

34:09.755 --> 34:10.746
Got it.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.592
Woo! Nice work.

34:18.764 --> 34:19.755
Thea!

34:34.072 --> 34:37.531
You've lost. It's as clear
as your imminent death.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.733
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:39.828 --> 34:42.696
I know that you bleed. I win.

34:44.291 --> 34:45.407
You don't want to do that.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.128
Are you all right?

34:58.346 --> 35:00.008
I learned a few tricks from Merlyn.

35:03.685 --> 35:04.971
Wait. Where did she go?

35:05.562 --> 35:09.806
That woman is hard to kill.
Were you really going to burn it?

35:11.318 --> 35:12.650
To ashes.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.190
The other assassins either fled
or they're wrapped up.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.771
I really didn't miss those guys.

35:16.865 --> 35:17.901
Speedy, the map.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.698
They were being literal.
They needed your blood to spill.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.904
That's definitely not "X"
marks the spot.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.577
Where does it lead?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.283
I believe I know where.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.378
Nanolithography, the map
is printed with bacteria.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.800
ROY: That's gross.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.469
FELICITY: When exposed to the enzymes
of Thea's DNA, it reveals itself.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.012
Ancient League secret?

35:42.098 --> 35:43.589
No, no.
This is bleeding edge science.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.175
This requires an atomic force
microscope. Leave it to Merlyn.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.261
Nyssa, you said you know
what this map leads to?

35:48.355 --> 35:49.721
These are ley lines.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.851
Great. Ley lines. You've only seen
those with Damien Darhk.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.102
These are different.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.480
I thought they only intersected
on one place on Earth.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.813
- JOHN: Doesn't look that way from this.
- Indeed. These lines are global.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.069
This suggests the existence of
three intersections

36:01.159 --> 36:03.401
of a kind I thought
only existed on Nanda Parbat.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.862
Right, but what only exists
on Nanda Parbat really?

36:05.955 --> 36:08.288
I mean, besides really
depressing decor.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.618
I know now why Merlyn called
his new league the "Thanatos Guild."

36:11.711 --> 36:13.293
Thanatos
is the personification of death.

36:13.380 --> 36:14.791
- In Greek mythology.
- NYSSA: Exactly.

36:14.881 --> 36:18.090
I believe these lines suggests the
existence of three installments.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.249
The three what?

36:19.427 --> 36:23.216
Your father discovered the existence
of three Lazarus Pits.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.677
Of course, he did.

36:25.767 --> 36:26.803
Thea, come on.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.681
Hey, Roy, just...
Let's give her some space.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.682
Thank you, sir.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.186
Officer.

36:40.365 --> 36:44.484
Nick. Or should I just call you
"Officer" because we're at work?

36:44.661 --> 36:47.620
Nick's fine. You're becoming
a regular around here.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.613
Yeah, well, you know,
I just stopped by to...

36:49.749 --> 36:50.830
See Lieutenant Drake.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.952
To ask you out. To dinner.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.002
Or drinks or like just coffee,

36:56.089 --> 36:57.455
or we can just
walk down the street and talk...

36:57.549 --> 36:59.882
- Yes.
- "Yes"?

36:59.968 --> 37:03.427
- I get off work tonight at 7:00.
- Yeah.

37:03.513 --> 37:05.345
So, should we say 8:00?

37:05.598 --> 37:09.638
8:00 is awesome. 8:00 is perfect.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.471
Yeah, I'll make reservations,
and I'll text you.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.773
- Sounds like a plan. See you tonight.
- Okay.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.281
- Hey.
- What're you doing here?

37:24.826 --> 37:26.658
Getting back on the horse, D.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.245
Back in the game, back in the saddle.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.665
I'm gonna get really
right into... What's wrong?

37:33.793 --> 37:37.082
I checked intake and evidence lockup
for any Vertigo-related cases.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.497
- And?
- There aren't any.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.798
Is that not a good thing?

37:41.885 --> 37:44.923
There aren't any Vertigo cases
because they've all been kicked.

37:45.013 --> 37:48.222
And the evidence released
by Captain Hill.

37:48.308 --> 37:51.972
So, she's dirty. She did it for Diaz.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.977
Ricardo Diaz is pushing Vertigo.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.772
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:04.532 --> 38:09.118
Look, I'm sorry
for storming out last night.

38:09.746 --> 38:14.286
I just really needed some space, but
it really had nothing to do with you.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.703
It's fine.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.873
I'm just trying to figure out if you
packed that bag to come with me,

38:18.963 --> 38:19.953
or Nyssa.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.961
I mean, it's pretty obvious she wants
to destroy the new Lazarus Pits

38:23.051 --> 38:24.758
just like she did
with the original one.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.380
I mean, can you blame her?

38:26.471 --> 38:29.885
What would happen if the League
or the Guild,

38:29.974 --> 38:33.558
or anyone got their hands on it,
how dangerous that would be?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.558
So, you are gonna go with Nyssa?

38:36.940 --> 38:41.355
Look, last night,
Ollie and I were talking,

38:42.654 --> 38:46.113
and we were talking about how when,

38:47.158 --> 38:50.117
you know, he becomes the Green Arrow,

38:51.830 --> 38:53.947
he feels complete.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.953
And I was thinking that maybe
that's because when...

38:58.586 --> 39:01.078
When he puts that hood on,

39:01.172 --> 39:04.586
he gets to right our fathers' wrongs.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.840
And maybe this could be my calling,

39:07.929 --> 39:11.548
this could be
what I've been looking for.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.132
So, you've made up your mind.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.560
You know what,

39:18.565 --> 39:19.726
so have I.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.860
- I'm gonna go with you.
- What?

39:29.075 --> 39:33.069
- No, no, you don't need to do that.
- Yes, I do.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.613
I told you,
it doesn't matter where we go,

39:35.707 --> 39:37.073
as long as we go together.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.368
God, how did I get to be so lucky.

39:40.503 --> 39:44.588
Hmm... I think it has something
to do with a stolen purse.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.709
OLIVER: Please, just

39:50.263 --> 39:51.925
be careful, all right?

39:52.265 --> 39:54.052
And if you need anything,

39:54.142 --> 39:57.306
or if you don't need anything,
just call me.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.307
- Keep her safe.
- You know I will.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.650
You drew them back into this, Nyssa,

40:14.245 --> 40:16.532
that carries with it
a certain responsibility.

40:16.623 --> 40:20.242
Thea is your sister
and the daughter of Malcolm Merlyn.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.785
She's less in need of protection
than you think.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.800
This is a Horchus dagger.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.002
In the League of Assassins,

40:31.095 --> 40:34.679
it symbolizes
the cutting of marital bonds.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.426
I hereby annul our marriage.

40:40.480 --> 40:45.396
Nyssa, as wedding gifts go,
this isn't half bad.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.400
Be well, Oliver.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.570
Well,

40:56.412 --> 40:57.402
this is it.

40:58.373 --> 41:00.285
Thanks for clearing
a few things out for me.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.707
Of course.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.003
- One more piece of advice?
- Sure.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.422
If you're gonna wear the hood,

41:08.675 --> 41:11.008
you shouldn't
string John along anymore.

41:11.761 --> 41:16.096
I thought I was the one who gave
that wise sibling advice.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.176
Nope. That has never been the case.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.643
I'm gonna miss you so much.

41:25.191 --> 41:28.605
You'll be with me the whole time.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.333
Goodbye, Speedy.
