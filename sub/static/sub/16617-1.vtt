I'm an astronaut.
I-I just came from space.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.490
Were you exposed to the virus?!
No, no, I promise!

00:24.492 --> 00:27.059
Pat Brown, last man on Earth.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.229
Should've stayed
in the truck, bud.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.231
Holy... farts.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.166
Carol.
You're pregnant.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.201
I'm pregnant! (laughs)

00:38.072 --> 00:39.438
Maybe I should
just go away for a while.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.477
GAIL: Carol, Tandy,
come look at this.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.545
TANDY:
Oh, dear God.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.714
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.750
Oh, farts.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.486
These guys do not
look friendly.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.321
Maybe they just
need directions.

00:56.323 --> 00:57.423
Hells bells, Carol!

00:57.425 --> 00:59.191
They don't need
damn directions!

00:59.193 --> 01:00.492
Okay, everyone
just calm down!

01:00.494 --> 01:02.761
Okay? There's no need
to freak out.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.065
Oh, crap. Run, run, run, run!

01:06.067 --> 01:07.566
Run, run, run! Go!

(screams)

01:10.337 --> 01:12.171
Carol, what's happening?

01:12.173 --> 01:14.506
There's some spooky people here
with possibly dark intentions.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.741
W-Well, let me out.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.044
Have you learned your lesson
about not using firearms?

01:19.046 --> 01:20.345
Yes. Yes, yes, yes!
Okay!

01:20.347 --> 01:21.513
Firearms are
not the answer.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.015
I stand by that.

01:23.017 --> 01:24.750
Okay, we got to go.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.585

01:33.560 --> 01:35.127
Oh, crap,
we're blocked in!

01:35.129 --> 01:36.462
Who was driving
the A-Team van?

01:36.464 --> 01:38.530
Ah, man, my bad!

01:38.532 --> 01:40.132
Okay, well, where...
do you have the keys?

01:40.134 --> 01:41.700
No.
What?!

01:41.702 --> 01:43.602
Oh, my goodness,
I think I left them inside!
(screams)

01:43.604 --> 01:47.606
Okay, guys, the key is attached
to a small plastic Mr. T.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.441
It is just the
classic "T" look,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.610
Mohawk, muscles,

01:51.612 --> 01:52.711
lots of gold chains.

So, after the
Northwest Passage,

05:02.736 --> 05:04.403
I ran into Darrell
and Lewis here,

05:04.405 --> 05:06.405
and we set sail
for Hawaii.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.507
And then we were
just passing by Malibu,

05:08.509 --> 05:10.742
and damn if we didn't see
your lights.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.279
Well, we just feel so bad
about murdering your friend.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.348
Just sick about it.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.317
Oh, well, we barely
knew that guy.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.819
It's just a horrible
misunderstanding.

05:22.255 --> 05:25.257
So, Lewis, um, what did you do
before all this?

05:25.259 --> 05:26.491
I was a surgeon.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.859
Oh! That's amazing.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.294
Carol and I,
we're pregnant, so...

05:29.296 --> 05:30.329
LEWIS:
No, no, no.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.364
For trees. A tree surgeon.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.665
More of an arborist.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.833
Ooh.
(laughs)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.968
That's too bad.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.870
How about you,
Blue Man Group?

05:38.872 --> 05:41.440
Purveyor of ice cream.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.542
Brief incarcerant.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.277
Jean art enthusiast.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.845
Wait, uh, jean art?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.313
Uh, like what it sounds.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.282
Art on jeans.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.484
You give me a pair of 501s
and a Sharpie,

05:52.486 --> 05:54.486
and I can make them sing
like a Doobie Brother.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.921
Well, that sounds fun.
(chuckles)

05:57.023 --> 05:58.724
What's up with the suit?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.459
Well, I never take it off
on land.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.461
I-It's... that's just
what the government wants,

06:02.463 --> 06:03.729
to fill me with virus.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.863
Right, Lewis?

06:06.966 --> 06:08.800
So I stay out
on the water.

06:08.802 --> 06:12.304
But it gets kind of
lonely out there.

06:12.306 --> 06:13.705
No family.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.341
No friends.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.809
I don't know if you know
how blessed you are

06:17.811 --> 06:19.378
to have found each other.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.746
Oh, I think we do,

06:20.748 --> 06:22.714
and it's all because
of Tandy here.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.649
He brought us together.
PAT:
Really?

06:24.651 --> 06:26.551
You're lucky to have
a leader like that.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.654
Well, I wouldn't say,
uh, I mean... leader?

06:29.656 --> 06:30.822
(laughs)

06:30.824 --> 06:31.823
Thank you, Pat.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.825
PAT:
You know, I know...

06:33.827 --> 06:36.862
I know we got off to an awkward
start, but is-is there

06:36.864 --> 06:40.065
any way that you guys would
consider letting us

06:40.067 --> 06:42.067
stay around for a spell?
Or one of us.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.435
We're not a package deal.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.504
We're easy, so, uh...

06:46.706 --> 06:49.341
Uh... c-could
you excuse us

06:49.343 --> 06:51.343
while we discuss
your fate?

06:51.345 --> 06:53.111
Well, of course.
Sure.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.782
They seem like pretty
good guys, right?

06:56.784 --> 06:57.783
GAIL:
Okay.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.918
I'm just gonna come
right out and say it:

06:59.920 --> 07:01.019
Pat sucks.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.721
Yeah, he's mad as a cut snake.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.456
Just a full-blown poddy-dodger.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.525
Ah, he's not
a poddy-dodger.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.427
Well, I like
Lewis's energy.

07:08.429 --> 07:09.628
There we go, Carol.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.363
But Pat, yeah, I mean,

07:11.365 --> 07:13.732
he just seems like
a real bad news Barry.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.766
I'll give them the news.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.867
Hey, guys...
(shotgun pumps)

07:15.869 --> 07:16.902
TANDY: No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.403
Okay, so they didn't make

07:18.405 --> 07:19.805
a great first impression,
but look at me.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.373
I mean, when I
first met Carol,

07:21.375 --> 07:22.874
I was such a mess,
she pulled a gun on me.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.042
Oh, it's true.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.777
You know, it took me
a while to realize

07:25.779 --> 07:27.879
that Tandy wasn't
a dangerous lunatic,

07:27.881 --> 07:30.882
but in fact
the man of my dreams.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.417
TANDY:
See?

07:32.419 --> 07:34.052
Now, why can't
we just treat them

07:34.054 --> 07:35.587
like we treated
each other?

07:35.589 --> 07:36.888
GAIL:
God, Tandy,

07:36.890 --> 07:39.758
why do you have such a tent
in your shorts about these guys?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.927
That's collected
fabric, Gail.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.062
Yeah, that's fabric.
God.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.664
Look...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.632
they're lonely, they're scared,

07:47.634 --> 07:50.202
and remember, we were the ones
who shot their friend.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.473
TANDY:
Hey, guys.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.510
Look, I'm really sorry
about this, but, uh...

07:58.512 --> 08:00.912
how would you like to stay?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.514
Are you serious?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.416
No, my name's Tandy.

08:04.418 --> 08:05.951
Why, did someone tell you
my name was "Serious"?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.018
Boom.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.654
(laughs)

08:09.656 --> 08:12.591
(laughs)

08:12.593 --> 08:15.093
You're not gonna regret this.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.662
I know we won't.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.433
The house is just
right up the path here.

08:21.435 --> 08:22.801
(chuckles)
What am I saying?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.704
You know where it is;
you stormed it earlier.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.639
I'm just trying to catch
my breath a little, you know.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.707
We'll be right up.

08:32.044 --> 08:36.448
Look, this could be
a really good thing for us.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.517
Like a fresh start,
if you know what I mean.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.885
Yes, Pat, yes.

08:39.887 --> 08:40.886
I mean, we both

08:40.888 --> 08:42.120
have our secrets,

08:42.122 --> 08:44.155
and it's gonna stay that way,
capisce?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.958
I don't really have
any secrets, Pat. I...

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
Fresh start.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.062
I understand, Pat.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.798
Fresh... start.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.635
Hey, you guys
coming up or what?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.036
Yeah, sure thing,
ding-a-ling.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.471
TANDY (laughs):
Ding-a-ling.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.473
Hey, how about we, uh,
ink up some jeans?

09:01.475 --> 09:02.874
I'd love it.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.875
Ding-a-ling.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.976
(laughs)

09:05.978 --> 09:08.980
Fresh start.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.582
(whispers):
Fresh start.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.022
Man, I love this room.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.592
Just seems like
the perfect place to masturbate.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.827
That's exactly what it was
designed for, actually.

09:22.829 --> 09:25.730
Oh, I... yeah, I'd do her,
I'd do her,

09:25.732 --> 09:29.167
I'd do her, I'd do her, I'd...

09:29.169 --> 09:31.503
well, I'd do anything
with two legs.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.071
I ain't fussy.
Well?

09:33.073 --> 09:36.675
Looking good,
Hollywood!

09:36.677 --> 09:37.842
Wow!
Hey, Pat.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.011
I'm being very sincere here:

09:40.013 --> 09:42.180
these are frigging rad.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.649
Thank you, Tandy.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.751
So, uh, these leg designs--

09:46.753 --> 09:48.053
walk me through them.

09:48.055 --> 09:52.090
Well, it's just a general
breast theme with cobras.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.526
So, it is
what it looks like, huh?

09:54.528 --> 09:56.027
Well... amazing.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.195
Oh.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.197
(screams)
Don't sit down.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.966
Those aren't sitting jeans.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.934
Oh.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.772
Uh, you know, I was
thinking, Tandy, uh...

10:07.774 --> 10:10.275
maybe I'd do, like,
jeans for the whole group.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.611
Pat, what a nice idea.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.212
You know, I never
been good with people.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.213
No.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.715
No, really, I...
Really?

10:16.717 --> 10:19.584
I get nervous around them
and I...

10:19.586 --> 10:20.819
I spook them.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.220
So...

10:22.222 --> 10:25.223
I just that thought maybe
this could be a good icebreaker.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.593
Hey, try<i> great</i> icebreaker, huh?

10:28.595 --> 10:31.262
It's too bad the<i> Titanic</i> wasn't
made out of your jeans, huh?

10:31.264 --> 10:32.297
(chuckles)

10:32.299 --> 10:35.166
(laughs)

10:35.168 --> 10:36.735
You know, I'm getting

10:36.737 --> 10:39.070
a good vibe about you, Tandy.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.605
Thanks, Pat.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.907
I'm vibing you, too.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.243
Hope your friends feel the same.

10:45.245 --> 10:49.381
Hey, you just be yourself
and you'll do fine.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.186
Care Bear, what are these?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.589
Oh, yeah, could you
put those on for me?

10:57.591 --> 10:59.090
They're eyebrows.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.660
I've just been having
a devil of a time

11:01.662 --> 11:03.828
tracking your emotional states,

11:03.830 --> 11:06.097
you know,
since you balded yourself.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.600
Is this really necessary?

11:08.602 --> 11:12.337
They say that eyebrows are
the curtains to the windows

11:12.339 --> 11:14.973
to the soul of your face.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.977
Okay, well, if they say it,
I should probably do it, right?

11:18.979 --> 11:21.780
You know, I'm so proud
of you for letting

11:21.782 --> 11:23.648
Lewis and Pat stay.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.316
That's very
"We Are the World" of you.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.851
Thanks, Care Bear.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.620
Although I'm still not sure
about that Lewis guy.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.722
Pat though? Oh, he's great.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.357
I mean, you know,
he's definitely a...

11:32.359 --> 11:35.026
a rescue, might pee
on the carpet from time to time,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.228
bark at a minority,
hump some legs.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.631
But once we housebreak him,
oh, he's gonna be lickin' faces

11:39.633 --> 11:40.965
and waggin' that tizzy.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.367
Tail.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.703
Are you sure?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.638
Carol, look at me.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.707
I got this.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.309
You're flirting with me.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.144
Oh.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.046
PAT:
<i>...animal faces,</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:57.816
inverted crosses, food...

11:57.818 --> 11:59.217
What else I got here?

11:59.219 --> 12:03.655
Protective Wiccan symbols,
a deck of cards, uh,

12:03.657 --> 12:05.990
your angels, your demons,

12:05.992 --> 12:07.325
the guy with the spiky hair

12:07.327 --> 12:09.828
who pees off
the back of pickup trucks,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.896
hatchets, rainbows.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.332
You know, it's just
a small spattering

12:14.334 --> 12:16.935
of what I could draw
on your jeans.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.070
Got it.
O... kay.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.842
You like hair?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.944
What?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.378
Hair. You like it?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.080
On guys?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.782
Hey-yo!

12:30.784 --> 12:32.884
I see you're all soaking up
the sunshine that is Pat.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.085
(both chuckle)

12:34.087 --> 12:36.020
What happened to your face?

12:36.022 --> 12:38.256
Yeah, your brows look insane.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.759
You got a problem
with his brows? What?!
Okay!

12:40.761 --> 12:42.761
Hey, hey!
Pat, Pat, Pat, no, no, no,
it's okay.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.196
Whoa! Whoa!
It's okay, huh?
They're just razzin' me.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.698
They're just having fun,
right, guys?

12:46.700 --> 12:48.133
We're having fun,
all right?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.400
I just didn't like
the way she said that.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.802
TANDY:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:50.804 --> 12:53.037
It's okay.
She didn't mean it, huh?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.039
Huh?
Hey, why don't you and I go out

12:55.041 --> 12:56.775
and blow off
a little steam, huh?

12:56.777 --> 12:58.042
Would you like that, Pat?
Yeah.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.210
Yeah, okay.
(laughs)

12:59.212 --> 13:00.945
Good, let's go.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.382
Whoa.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.284
Think about your jeans.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.387
'Cause... you know?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.722
TANDY:
That was sweet of you.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.056
PAT:
Where have you been all day?

13:12.058 --> 13:13.458
GAIL:
All right, Lewis,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.160
start talking.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.961
What do you mean?

13:16.963 --> 13:18.263
What's the deal
with Pat?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.464
Oh, Pat?

13:19.466 --> 13:20.899
(chuckles)

13:20.901 --> 13:24.235
Pat is just a... fantastic...

13:24.237 --> 13:25.737
constant, just...

13:25.739 --> 13:27.138
endless source of...

13:27.140 --> 13:28.840
(chuckles)

13:28.842 --> 13:31.109
He's very fun. (laughs)

13:31.111 --> 13:32.744
He doesn't seem fun.

13:32.746 --> 13:35.146
No. He seems like
a solid gold nut.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.347
LEWIS:
What?

13:36.349 --> 13:38.116
Not my Pat, no.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.784
Something's not
adding up here.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.019
It's like a bi-corn.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.353
"A bi-corn"?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.289
A unicorn with two horns.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.259
Well, this is totally, totally
unrelated, but, uh...

13:48.261 --> 13:50.261
he's not, like,
around here, right?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.930
Okay, damn it, Lewis,
cut to the chase.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.766
What are we dealing with here?
He's crazy, right?

13:54.768 --> 13:57.969
He's-he's... he's not just
crazy, he's-he's dangerous.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.338
(whispers):
Like, he's seriously dangerous.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.106
Wait, what are
you saying?

14:02.108 --> 14:03.875
I'm saying,

14:03.877 --> 14:07.846
I think you shot
the wrong person.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.454
And then, after being at sea
with him for a few days,

14:16.456 --> 14:19.791
we realized this person
is severely unwell.

14:19.793 --> 14:23.494
He told me that he killed
somebody a few weeks ago

14:23.496 --> 14:25.063
'cause he was
going to alert

14:25.065 --> 14:26.531
the bunker people
to his location.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.033
Some kind of
government conspiracy.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.335
(gasps) I knew it, I knew it!

14:30.337 --> 14:32.136
He's a flippin' psycho.

14:32.138 --> 14:34.372
Oh, my God, Tandy's with him.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.607
Fire in the hole.

14:38.811 --> 14:39.811
(both groan)

14:39.813 --> 14:41.045
Damn!
Damn it.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.849
Okay, let's try, uh, five
degrees to the right.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.986
Pat, you are such a
breath of fresh air.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.087
Thank you.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.189
Been going through kind of a...

14:51.191 --> 14:53.091
a tough time lately.
Oh, yeah?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.994
I lost my brother
not too long ago.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.161
Sorry to hear that.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.496
He was the best.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.832
Oh, man, I really
looked up to him.

15:00.834 --> 15:05.069
He was the one who
should've survived, not me.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.138
I miss him.

15:09.508 --> 15:11.409
Fire in the hole!

15:14.046 --> 15:15.513
(both groan)

15:15.515 --> 15:18.249
Okay, maybe a little
more to the left now.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.020
You know,
I had a friend like that.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.388
Really good fella.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.658
We had a real good connection.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.429
And then, forces beyond
my control just

15:31.431 --> 15:33.364
took him away, just like that.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.934
Oh, sorry to hear that.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.902
What was your brother's name?

15:37.904 --> 15:39.604
Mike.
Mike?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.539
That's the name
of the fella I met.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.875
(chuckles):
Yeah, pretty common name.

15:43.877 --> 15:47.312
Well, here's to the Mikes.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.880
To the Mikes.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.082
Fire in the hole!

15:51.084 --> 15:52.483
This one's looking good!

15:52.485 --> 15:54.953
It's looking good.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.957
(both laughing, cheering)

16:00.459 --> 16:02.293
Hoo!
Yeah!

16:02.295 --> 16:03.561
Well, you know
what they say,

16:03.563 --> 16:05.930
"Pier today,
gone tomorrow."

16:05.932 --> 16:06.931
Boom.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.166
(laughs)

16:08.168 --> 16:10.234
Tandy, that is
the most beautiful thing

16:10.236 --> 16:11.903
I have ever seen.

16:11.905 --> 16:14.038
It's called
friendship, Pat.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.412
Gail, I am worried
about Melissa.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.348
She's fine.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.617
She murdered someone, and I
don't think she's processing it.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.420
Melissa,

16:29.422 --> 16:31.656
have you processed
your murder of Darrell?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.091
Yeah.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.359
See?

16:35.661 --> 16:36.961
Good evening, Vietnam.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.329
Tandy, where
have you been?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.964
What, uh, Pat and I
just blew up

16:39.966 --> 16:42.166
the Santa Monica Pier;
isn't that cool?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.302
Tandy, look, there are some
things you don't know about Pat.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.171
Well, there are some things
that<i> you</i> don't know about Pat.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.272
He's very dangerous.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
Yeah, Tandy, he
needs to leave.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.609
Look, I know Pat's awkward.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.211
Pat knows he's awkward.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.946
But he's really trying.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.048
And all he wants is
to be a part of this group.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.750
It's not...
(Lewis clears throat)

17:01.387 --> 17:03.354
Hope I'm not late for dinner.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.556
Well, look at this.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.959
Aren't you spiffy.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.627
(chuckles):
Oh, that's funny.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.463
But I thought my name was
not Spiffy, but rather Patrick.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.464
Uh, boom.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.600
Um...

17:18.003 --> 17:20.071
I just...

17:20.073 --> 17:22.140
I-I want to thank y'all

17:22.142 --> 17:24.709
for opening
your hearts to me.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.211
I-I would never have
had the courage

17:27.213 --> 17:30.648
to take off that suit
if it weren't for your support.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.316
And for the first time

17:32.318 --> 17:37.255
in a long time,
I feel like I'm-I'm home.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.790
You are, bud.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.159
(chuckles softly)

17:41.161 --> 17:43.161
Oh. I really hope
you all like jeans,

17:43.163 --> 17:45.696
because I made custom
jobbies for each

17:45.698 --> 17:47.498
and every one of you.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.567
And, Gail...

17:49.569 --> 17:51.069
these are for you.

17:56.375 --> 17:59.210
(quietly):
Thank you.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.080
Pat, you shouldn't have,
but you did.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.515
I'm telling you,
it just feels so great

18:04.517 --> 18:06.384
to be out of the
suit, you know?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.718
And, I mean, and

18:07.720 --> 18:09.454
touch things.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.523
Like... couch.

18:14.526 --> 18:15.693
Lamp!

18:15.695 --> 18:17.195
TANDY:
You walk around,

18:17.197 --> 18:18.396
touch whatever you want.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.064
'Cause you already
touched our hearts.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.133
Gail.
Keep it moving.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.304
Like...

18:26.306 --> 18:27.438
chair.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.373
(quietly):
Tandy, he killed someone.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.309
Oh, is that what
this is about?
PAT: Book.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.643
Huh? He killed someone?

18:32.645 --> 18:35.113
Well, may I remind you,
you killed someone,

18:35.115 --> 18:36.314
and you killed someone,

18:36.316 --> 18:37.281
and you killed someone.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.383
(gasps)
PAT:
Photograph.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.751
CAROL: I can't believe
you would say that...

18:40.753 --> 18:42.820
(Carol and Tandy
continue talking quietly)

18:45.124 --> 18:46.724
PAT:
Mike.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.060
(whispers):
It's completely different.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.661
Oh, so we're just gonna
turn our backs on him?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.663
I guess that's
our M.O., huh?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.298
TODD: What are you
talking about, Tandy?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.268
TANDY: This group has a history
of throwing people out

18:57.270 --> 18:58.669
like trash
when we're done with them.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.072
Or did you
conveniently forget

19:01.074 --> 19:03.241
quarantining Mike,
driving Phil out?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.810
Heck, you even tried
to kick me out, your leader!

19:06.578 --> 19:08.146
Now, listen to me.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.815
This is a good man, okay?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.451
Yeah, does he try too hard
sometimes? Maybe.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.253
At least he's out there
on the playing field,

19:15.255 --> 19:17.255
instead of sitting
in the peanut gallery

19:17.257 --> 19:19.157
playing judge,
jury and executioner.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.526
PAT: Tandy!
And he's got a gun.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.298
PAT:
Nobody move!

19:27.300 --> 19:28.633
Okay, P-Pat, Pat?

19:28.635 --> 19:29.834
I'm not gonna move
that much further.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.336
I just want to...
just want to talk.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.138
Now, can I just ask Pat?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.674
Can we have Patrick back?

19:36.676 --> 19:39.343
I thought we were friends.
I thought I could trust you.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.811
I am your friend!

19:40.813 --> 19:42.380
Trust away!

19:42.382 --> 19:44.615
You're a big fake.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.518
You're as fake
as those stupid eyebrows.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.719
Take 'em off.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.488
No, no, please, please.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.522
Take 'em off!

19:51.524 --> 19:53.558
Okay, okay!
Help me out.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.359
Where are the rest of 'em?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.627
The rest of who?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.462
The bunker people!

19:58.464 --> 19:59.397
Here we go.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.898
What the hell's
he talking about?

20:02.334 --> 20:04.135
This.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.370
Your Mike is my Mike.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.472
The Mikes
have become one.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.641
You lied!

20:10.643 --> 20:13.377
So you could infect me
with the virus!

20:13.379 --> 20:15.246
'K-Kay, man, calm down,
okay, man?

20:15.248 --> 20:18.316
Oh, I'm calm.
I'm "cume" as a "calmcumber."

20:18.318 --> 20:22.653
'Cause I know the path
is laid out before me now.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.188
You're confused.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.158
I thought my name was Pat.
Uh, boom.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.159
(all scream)

20:28.161 --> 20:29.360
No!

20:29.362 --> 20:31.529
Please, please, please!

20:31.531 --> 20:33.331
We're so sorry
that we upset you.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.600
He's being sincere;
you just probably can't tell

20:35.602 --> 20:37.268
'cause he has no eyebrows.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.170
Head or heart?

20:39.172 --> 20:41.372
What?

20:41.374 --> 20:43.207
I want to know what you want me
to shoot first,

20:43.209 --> 20:44.909
after I shoot your balls off.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.345
Your head or your heart?

20:47.347 --> 20:49.547
(high-pitched):
None of 'em.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.581
Wrong answer.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.782
(all scream, gun clicks empty)

20:51.784 --> 20:53.184
Run!

20:53.186 --> 20:54.552
(all screaming)

20:54.554 --> 20:56.387
TANDY: Geez, Lewis,
thanks for giving us

20:56.389 --> 20:58.289
a heads up about your friend!

20:58.291 --> 21:00.191
TODD: Get in, get in!
I got the key!

21:00.193 --> 21:02.760
I got the key!
KEY CHAIN: I pity the fool.
I pity the fool.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.929
(engine starts)
TANDY: Go, go, go, go, go!

21:04.931 --> 21:06.631
(all screaming)

21:06.633 --> 21:08.933
(tires screech)
He's gonna shoot us!

21:12.471 --> 21:14.238
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

21:14.240 --> 21:15.473
Oh, my God!

21:15.475 --> 21:17.541
Oh, my God,
I think I killed him!

21:17.543 --> 21:20.111
Oh, I think I killed him!

Zorn is an animated barbarian

22:08.828 --> 22:11.095
from the island nation
of Zephyria.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.764
MAN: He wears a battle strap
and furry underpants.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.499
Other than that,
he's just a normal guy.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.369
My name's Zorn,
defender of Zephyria,

22:18.371 --> 22:20.471
conqueror of the tribes
of Agon,

22:20.473 --> 22:22.773
decapitator of
the Dark Herdsmen of Grith.
Yeah, I know, Zorn.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.543
-It was my last name too.
-He's trying to reconnect
with his ex-wife--

22:25.545 --> 22:27.311
I'm with Craig now.

22:27.313 --> 22:30.147
When you just said that,
you were actually staring
at my quadriceps.

22:30.149 --> 22:33.317
-No, I wasn't.
-forge a connection finally
with his teenage son.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.886
Alan's relationship with Zorn
is tenuous.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.722
It's weird
'cause he just got back.

22:37.724 --> 22:40.157
What do you think?
It's all yours.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.625
(screeches)

22:41.627 --> 22:44.829
When he comes back, he finds out
that she has a fiancé.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.299
Zorn, this is Craig,
my fiancé.

22:48.301 --> 22:51.535
Zorn, it's obvious
that you're applying
way too much pressure

22:51.537 --> 22:53.971
-to my hand right now.
-Uh-huh.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.539
Actually, it hurts.
It does?

22:55.541 --> 22:58.342
It really does.
You're emasculating me
in front of my fiancée.

22:58.344 --> 23:01.345
Zorn is surprised to find
that people in Orange County

23:01.347 --> 23:02.980
are not that impressed.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.016
You a big bracelet nut?
Check this one out.
Hey! Look at that.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.885
Zorn's kind of
a man out of time.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.087
-Come here! I'm gonna kill you!
-Oh, my God!
-Don't murder her!

23:10.089 --> 23:12.590
He'd be a great fit
hundreds of years ago.

23:12.592 --> 23:15.393
-You're gone. Put that away,
or you're gone. So gone.
-Okay. You got it.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.461
<i>Put that away!</i>
<i>No, absolutely.</i>
