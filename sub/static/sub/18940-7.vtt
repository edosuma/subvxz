00:01.251 --> 00:03.084
<i>Previously on x company...
Favorite food?</i>

00:03.120 --> 00:06.021
Cherries with garlic and salt.
How about we stick to...

00:06.056 --> 00:08.857
Just cherries?

00:08.892 --> 00:11.393
I want to make sure
that you never forget.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.361
The choice you made.

00:13.397 --> 00:16.865
My family used to own
a candy shop in nadzieja.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.168
The building's been empty ever
since the nazis took my parents.

00:20.203 --> 00:23.605
But I'm going to open
that candy store again.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.341
Aurora, his feelings for you
make you all vulnerable.

00:26.376 --> 00:29.544
End it. That kiss?

00:29.579 --> 00:31.613
Yeah? It was a mistake.

00:31.648 --> 00:34.115
How is sabine? Her happiness is.

00:34.151 --> 00:36.184
My first concern.
She's ready to love.

00:36.219 --> 00:38.687
Another child. It would be good
for both of you.

00:38.722 --> 00:41.356
Have you asked her
what she thinks about that?

00:41.391 --> 00:44.793
This man. Your friend.
Talk or he dies.

00:44.828 --> 00:46.695
We had two orders. No!

00:46.730 --> 00:49.464
The first was to destroy
as many refineries in poland...

00:49.499 --> 00:51.800
Look at me!
No, no, no! Please don't!

00:51.835 --> 00:54.302
I'm hosting a party
at my country home.

00:54.337 --> 00:58.773
I would be very pleased if you could
come as well. I wouldn't miss it.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.309
Operation marigold isn't
about a refinery.

01:01.344 --> 01:03.978
It's about him.
Professor harald voigt.

01:04.013 --> 01:06.214
He is working on a formula
to increase the production.

01:06.249 --> 01:08.883
Of synthetic oil.
He's going to flood germany.

01:08.919 --> 01:10.885
With synthetic oil
and win the war by springtime,

01:10.921 --> 01:12.965
Thanks to a formula in his head
that is shared with no one.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.324
So, if something happened to voigt...
It's not that easy.

01:16.359 --> 01:18.793
After yesterday schmidt
moved him to a secure location.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.596
He's the only one who knows
where the man is.

01:21.631 --> 01:24.733
I was wrong. I see now why you
do this even if it's not safe.

01:24.768 --> 01:27.669
<i>I want to help too.
We are moving forward.</i>

01:27.704 --> 01:30.905
With our germanization campaign.
Anyone with nordic.

01:30.941 --> 01:34.075
Or phalian traits may remain.

01:34.111 --> 01:36.344
The soldiers then come in
to clean out the rest.

01:36.379 --> 01:38.813
We need a battle plan.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.815
The nazis are cleaning out
a village tomorrow.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.820 --> 02:20.522
What's going on?
Government health check today.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.292
Come inside, children!

02:24.327 --> 02:27.562
Time to come inside. Let's go!

02:27.597 --> 02:30.231
Meet me here after, okay?

02:30.267 --> 02:32.767
And no dawdling.

02:43.013 --> 02:45.079
The only weapons.

02:45.115 --> 02:47.081
My lot could find in the woods
were stick guns.

02:47.117 --> 02:50.251
Stick guns? For training.

02:50.287 --> 02:52.921
Don't worry about it.
Where'd these come from?

02:52.956 --> 02:56.391
Our government-in-exile
has been hiding army weapons.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.393
Since the war broke out.
The germans use.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.395
The vistula river
to transport their guns,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.397
And we also use it
to transport ours.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.465
We just need to know.

03:04.501 --> 03:07.669
What village the germans
are attacking today.

03:07.704 --> 03:10.205
My people are working on it.
That's not the problem.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.174
Your people didn't
send ammunition.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.543
Come.

03:23.086 --> 03:25.186
<i>Good morning, children.</i>

03:25.222 --> 03:28.389
My name is fraulein adler
and this is frau bauer.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.725
Today is a very special day.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.027
We are going to have
a competition!

03:33.063 --> 03:35.029
And the winners will get
to go on a trip!

03:35.065 --> 03:37.031
Now.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.734
The students who collect
the most points will win.

03:39.769 --> 03:41.736
Points will be given.

03:41.771 --> 03:43.738
For the prettiest eyes,

03:43.773 --> 03:46.040
The nicest hair,

03:46.076 --> 03:48.409
The fairest complexion.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.478
Everything that
makes you special.

03:56.219 --> 03:58.920
Now, sit very still for me.

03:58.955 --> 04:01.055
That's good.

04:05.195 --> 04:07.428
You do have pretty eyes,
don't you?

04:13.803 --> 04:17.305
Miss, we'll need your class's
full medical records, please.

04:17.339 --> 04:20.642
Yes, fraulein adler.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.462
How did you sleep?

04:41.498 --> 04:45.199
All right. Come here.

04:52.776 --> 04:54.742
I wish we could stay here
instead of going.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.978
To my father's garden party.

04:57.013 --> 05:00.014
Just the two of us.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.083
I miss you.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.155
I'm right here.

05:07.190 --> 05:10.525
You are and you aren't.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.964
I wish you would
tell me what happened.

05:15.999 --> 05:18.666
When they had you prisoner.
Please.

05:18.702 --> 05:20.635
Don't.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.737
It still needs time.

05:31.047 --> 05:34.282
What is your name?

05:37.053 --> 05:39.053
What is her name?

05:39.089 --> 05:41.556
Ania nowak.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.859
Please stand up, ania.

05:44.894 --> 05:46.928
Just like your friends.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.901
She will also be
classified "w.E."

05:53.937 --> 05:58.039
And the others?

05:58.074 --> 06:00.541
For the camps. That's right.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.578
We will add up the results.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.514
And the lucky winners will be
selected later today.

06:06.549 --> 06:10.451
You will be taken on a trip,
with all the other.

06:10.487 --> 06:12.687
Special children of nadzeja.
The soldiers will arrive.

06:12.722 --> 06:14.789
On the 3 o'clock train
to process the village.

06:18.228 --> 06:20.228
Let's get back to the office.

06:22.732 --> 06:25.400
Thank you, miss.
Thank you, children.

06:25.435 --> 06:27.368
We'll see the winners
in a few hours.

06:27.404 --> 06:29.937
Thank you.

06:39.249 --> 06:42.550
Your men are trained?
Many of them are former army,

06:42.585 --> 06:44.652
Like me. The rest learned fast.

06:44.687 --> 06:48.389
Here we go. Ammunition. Could've
done with this in france.

06:48.425 --> 06:52.060
I don't think
they work with stick guns.

06:52.095 --> 06:55.163
This war won't be won
on the battlefield.

06:55.198 --> 06:57.598
It'll be won in the streets.

06:57.634 --> 07:01.169
And there's no point
waiting for the russians.

07:01.204 --> 07:03.504
The only thing
they're ever on time for.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.740
Is a free drink.

07:08.378 --> 07:10.411
A german or a russian?

07:10.447 --> 07:12.980
German first.
Duty before pleasure.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.026
Alec?

07:27.564 --> 07:30.431
Where are you off to?
The station is that way.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.533
I could ask you the same thing.

07:32.569 --> 07:36.037
That is easy.
I saw you and I followed.

07:36.072 --> 07:38.206
You followed me?

07:38.241 --> 07:40.641
Sit down.

07:40.677 --> 07:44.579
Act normal. Everything's normal.
Okay.

07:49.919 --> 07:52.220
This is for you.

07:54.424 --> 07:56.324
Fresh cherries.

07:56.359 --> 07:58.459
Where did you get these?

07:58.495 --> 08:00.495
Black market.

08:04.100 --> 08:08.202
You don't like cherries?
I love cherries.

08:11.074 --> 08:14.909
What was she like?

08:14.944 --> 08:17.178
The friend you lost.

08:17.213 --> 08:19.547
I never said she was a she.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.216
You didn't need to.

08:25.722 --> 08:28.890
She was strong.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.759
I was intimidated at first.

08:31.794 --> 08:34.662
Afraid of disappointing her.
Did you?

08:34.697 --> 08:38.533
I don't know.
Maybe I would have.

08:38.568 --> 08:41.434
If we'd had more time.

08:41.471 --> 08:43.538
But being near her.

08:43.573 --> 08:46.207
Made me feel brave,

08:46.242 --> 08:48.242
Like I could do anything.

08:48.278 --> 08:52.547
You still can. Before her,

08:52.582 --> 08:55.216
There was no one.

08:55.251 --> 08:57.818
I was no one.

08:57.854 --> 08:59.854
Alec.

08:59.889 --> 09:01.989
Have a cherry.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.873
Let's have a picnic after work.

09:18.908 --> 09:21.576
I know a place by the river;
It's very quiet,

09:21.611 --> 09:24.612
Very private. I used to go there
when I was a girl...

09:24.647 --> 09:28.216
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

09:28.251 --> 09:30.685
No, irena, that's not...
It's fine. I'm sorry.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.955
I will go.
I will see you at work.

09:48.238 --> 09:50.371
She seems nice.

09:50.406 --> 09:52.807
She is.

09:56.145 --> 09:59.213
What did you learn?
Their target is nadzieja.

09:59.249 --> 10:02.216
The soldiers are coming
by train at 3:00pm.

10:02.252 --> 10:04.218
That doesn't give us much time.

10:04.254 --> 10:06.254
Almost everyone in the village
has been classified.

10:06.289 --> 10:08.723
As "undesirable."
the germans want them gone.

10:08.758 --> 10:11.892
Even the children.
It's going to be.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.961
An extermination. No, it won't.

10:13.963 --> 10:16.230
I'll tell janowski to bring
all the fighters he can.

10:16.266 --> 10:19.667
And then I'll go to the school.
While I attend.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.737
A nazi tea party.
I hate this. I hate her.

10:22.772 --> 10:24.739
Helene?

10:24.774 --> 10:26.741
I dream in german now.

10:26.776 --> 10:29.243
I can't escape her.

10:29.279 --> 10:32.046
You control her.

10:32.081 --> 10:34.782
We've heard from the camp.

10:34.817 --> 10:36.717
The panzers are moving
into stalingrad.

10:36.753 --> 10:38.664
The only reason the russians
are holding them off is.

10:38.688 --> 10:40.621
Because the germans
are getting low on fuel.

10:40.657 --> 10:43.557
But if professor voigt
gets marigold running,

10:43.593 --> 10:45.504
They'll be unstoppable
on every front. Go to the party.

10:45.528 --> 10:47.428
Find out where voight is.
Whatever it takes.

10:47.463 --> 10:49.397
Whatever it takes.

10:49.432 --> 10:51.565
Be safe.

10:51.601 --> 10:54.535
You, too.

10:57.607 --> 11:00.207
Your commander,
he let your men die.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.710
He did. I offered you my men.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.546
To save them. Why did he
order you to stand down?

11:05.581 --> 11:07.882
"Strategy."

11:07.917 --> 11:09.884
If you kill all your fighters,

11:09.919 --> 11:12.219
There won't be any men
left to lead.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.856
Then I reckon
we won't need leaders.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.227
It works on paper.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.897
Redrawing borders is
their favorite game.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.899
The germans want
to eliminate us,

11:24.934 --> 11:28.235
The russians to absorb us,
the americans ignore us.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.572
But ours is not
a paper war, is it?

11:31.607 --> 11:35.176
Come on. Through there.

11:35.211 --> 11:39.680
They are targeting nadzieja.
What?

11:39.716 --> 11:42.216
Our contact says troops are
coming by train at 3 o'clock.

11:42.251 --> 11:46.087
We know the village.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.190
It's close to here.
That's where we grew up.

11:49.225 --> 11:52.193
So we have an advantage. There.

11:52.228 --> 11:55.730
The train and the main road.
Tomek, do you have.

11:55.765 --> 11:58.532
Anything that can help us?

11:58.568 --> 12:00.801
Explosives on the rails.

12:00.837 --> 12:04.772
The train destroys itself.
It tips over like a broken toy.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.575
Good. They'll never
make it into nadzieja.

12:07.610 --> 12:10.277
Go get a group together.
We'll take the forest route.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.214
All right, let's go!
Okay, everybody!

12:13.249 --> 12:15.883
We need to warn the villagers.
I'll go with you.

12:15.918 --> 12:18.719
We should let sinclair know.

12:18.755 --> 12:20.721
Why? To keep him informed.

12:20.757 --> 12:22.723
The way he kept us informed?
He had reasons.

12:22.759 --> 12:25.226
For doing what he did.
Lying to us.

12:25.261 --> 12:27.261
And sending 2 rookies
to their deaths?

12:31.134 --> 12:34.735
Isn't it beautiful? Very.

12:34.771 --> 12:37.571
It's not paris,
but I love it here.

12:37.607 --> 12:41.008
Herr obergruppenfuhrer.
Herr brigadefuhrer faber.

12:41.043 --> 12:43.944
Hello, sabine. Hello, heidi.

12:43.980 --> 12:47.081
Helene. So good
to see you again.

12:47.116 --> 12:50.951
You, as well. You have
a beautiful home.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.987
So glad you could make it
to my good-bye party.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.656
You're leaving us already?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.526
My work in berlin beckons,
I'm afraid.

12:58.561 --> 13:02.430
That's too bad.
When must you go?

13:02.465 --> 13:05.900
Tomorrow.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.875
I had my doubts
bringing you to poland,

13:14.910 --> 13:17.044
But I was impressed
with how you handled.

13:17.079 --> 13:19.046
The saboteurs at the refinery.

13:19.081 --> 13:21.048
I'm glad I could help.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.484
I've arranged for you
to accompany me to berlin.

13:23.519 --> 13:25.652
Herr professor voigt.

13:25.688 --> 13:28.555
Will be presented
with an award at the gala.

13:28.591 --> 13:30.958
For his contributions
to the reich.

13:30.993 --> 13:33.227
He's coming out of seclusion?
Personally, I think.

13:33.262 --> 13:36.296
The professor should keep
a low public profile,

13:36.332 --> 13:39.066
At least until
his project is unveiled.

13:39.101 --> 13:42.202
But with our challenges
in stalingrad,

13:42.238 --> 13:45.572
The fuhrer wants to do what
he can to keep morale high.

13:45.608 --> 13:48.509
I imagine the rsd will make.

13:48.544 --> 13:50.677
Professor voigt's safety
a priority.

13:50.713 --> 13:53.213
The fuhrer's guards
will have their hands full.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.417
I want professor voigt's
security handled personally.

13:56.452 --> 13:58.419
By someone I can trust.

13:58.454 --> 14:00.854
I'll do my best. Good.

14:00.890 --> 14:03.991
I've arranged train tickets
for sabine as well.

14:04.026 --> 14:06.894
I don't think it's necessary
that she come along.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.029
Berlin is home.
Your apartment is still yours.

14:09.064 --> 14:11.231
It will be good for her
to sleep in her own bed.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.802
We leave
tomorrow evening at 7:15.

14:21.877 --> 14:23.744
It's a shame
obergruppenfuhrer schmidt has.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.380
To leave us for berlin.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.715
This is to celebrate the tenth
anniversary of the reich?

14:28.751 --> 14:32.719
It is. It will be
a truly historic celebration.

14:32.755 --> 14:38.025
And he mentioned to me he'll be
attending an exclusive gala.

14:38.060 --> 14:40.727
Inner circle only.

14:40.763 --> 14:43.108
I'm sure it will be memorable.
They have a lot to be proud of.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.766
I'll let you know how it goes.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.968
Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt
told me.

14:48.003 --> 14:50.170
That all the single men
are asked.

14:50.206 --> 14:52.806
To bring a female companion.

14:52.842 --> 14:54.641
Purely platonic, of course.

14:54.677 --> 14:58.479
Someone who embodies the highest
feminine values of the reich.

14:58.514 --> 15:01.348
What an opportunity for you.

15:01.383 --> 15:03.450
Well, it's not official yet.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.887
But I've already
picked out a dress.

15:06.922 --> 15:08.789
Heidi! Hello!

15:08.824 --> 15:12.292
Berta.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.294
Derica.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.530
Have you met brigadefuhrer
faber's wife, sabine?

15:16.565 --> 15:18.532
Of course.
Nice to see you again.

15:18.567 --> 15:21.535
And you as well.
And you remember my colleague,

15:21.570 --> 15:23.537
Helene bauer.
Nice to meet you again.

15:23.572 --> 15:25.639
No.

15:25.674 --> 15:29.409
I can barely go 5 minutes
without excusing myself.

15:29.445 --> 15:31.778
I remember how it felt.
I thought my fourth.

15:31.814 --> 15:34.381
Would be easier, but this one
can't come soon enough.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.450
How old are yours, helene?

15:36.485 --> 15:40.454
I don't have any children.
Don't give up.

15:40.489 --> 15:42.856
Sometimes it takes a few tries,
but it's worth it.

15:42.892 --> 15:45.592
To be honest, I didn't feel.

15:45.628 --> 15:47.761
Like a real woman
until I became a mother.

15:47.796 --> 15:51.798
It's a true honor.
I think there are.

15:51.834 --> 15:54.635
Other "honorable" things to do
in life besides boiling diapers.

15:58.073 --> 16:00.340
Well, it was nice
seeing you all!

16:00.376 --> 16:02.843
Excuse me. Heidi.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.513
Heidi. Where are you going?
I need to change.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.516
Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt has
organized a pheasant hunt.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.518
And I detest side-saddle.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.854
Do you have any
riding gear to spare?

16:13.889 --> 16:15.856
You ride? Not for a long time,

16:15.891 --> 16:17.858
But I'd love to come along.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.860
Women don't usually
go on the hunt.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.563
Except for you. Except for me.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.202
The outside rail on a bend.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.705
Is the weakest spot.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.910
When the train passes over,

16:36.946 --> 16:38.890
The pressure triggers it
and the whole train goes flying.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.082
Good to keep our distance.

16:42.117 --> 16:44.351
We will make sure
there are no survivors.

16:44.386 --> 16:46.553
Shit. Come on.

16:48.958 --> 16:51.858
Go, go!

17:05.074 --> 17:08.675
You said they patrolled
in the morning.

17:08.711 --> 17:11.545
There's an officer.
It's not a patrol.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.115
They're headed to the village.

17:19.154 --> 17:22.888
Gentlemen!

17:22.925 --> 17:25.392
Who's thirsty?

17:28.063 --> 17:30.097
Anything I should know?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.766
I'm leaving for berlin
tomorrow to provide.

17:32.801 --> 17:36.536
Private security
for professor voigt.

17:36.572 --> 17:38.572
Voigt will be
at the anniversary gala.

17:38.607 --> 17:41.775
Yes. He's coming out of seclusion to
receive an award. Then I need to be there.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.777
Himmler will be attending.
The fuhrer is rumored.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.979
To make an appearance.
Security will be impenetrable.

17:46.015 --> 17:49.082
Good thing I have
someone on the inside.

17:49.118 --> 17:52.819
There's nothing I can do.

17:52.855 --> 17:54.788
To get you in. Invitation only.

17:57.860 --> 18:01.695
Best shot picks his horse first.

18:05.434 --> 18:09.302
Pull!

18:14.043 --> 18:17.010
Ha! Very good!

18:17.046 --> 18:19.513
Obergruppenfuhrer,

18:19.548 --> 18:23.116
About tomorrow, should I arrange
my own train ticket or...

18:23.152 --> 18:26.019
How did it go at the school?

18:26.055 --> 18:28.522
Very well. Good.

18:28.557 --> 18:30.957
Another one for good luck?

18:33.062 --> 18:36.129
Cheers. Cheers.

18:39.334 --> 18:41.668
Pull!

18:46.208 --> 18:49.309
Perhaps I need more than luck.

18:49.344 --> 18:52.045
May I?

18:52.081 --> 18:54.381
I didn't know you could shoot.

18:54.416 --> 18:57.684
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

19:03.492 --> 19:06.893
Thank you.

19:06.929 --> 19:09.863
Pull!

19:15.104 --> 19:18.205
Remind me never to get
in your cross-hairs.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.175
Here we are.

19:22.211 --> 19:25.178
Do you ride as well
as you shoot?

19:25.214 --> 19:29.182
You're going to have
to let me know.

19:29.218 --> 19:32.519
3 o'clock!
My brother and janowski.

19:32.554 --> 19:34.855
Used to sit out back,
reading comics.

19:34.890 --> 19:38.024
If I stole candy for them,
they would let me stay.

19:38.060 --> 19:40.360
The germans won't take it today.

19:40.395 --> 19:42.362
Not today.

19:42.397 --> 19:45.198
Where's the school? This way.

19:45.234 --> 19:47.801
They're here!

19:49.805 --> 19:53.106
Come on. We have
to warn the others!

20:20.302 --> 20:22.269
Off the hour. It's a warning.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.271
The germans must
already be there.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.173
They were supposed
to come by train.

20:26.208 --> 20:29.576
They didn't.
Let's go back for the others.

20:29.612 --> 20:32.446
No time. I am coming.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.615
Setting explosives is one thing,

20:34.650 --> 20:36.917
But I made a promise
to keep you out of the fight.

20:36.952 --> 20:40.654
My mother isn't here anymore.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.829
Stay in the treeline.

20:48.864 --> 20:50.931
Let's go.

21:22.665 --> 21:26.600
Are you sure you have
to leave us so soon?

21:26.635 --> 21:28.936
I have an important function
to attend.

21:28.971 --> 21:32.239
Part of the official
celebrations?

21:32.274 --> 21:34.441
It will be rewarding
to have our work recognized.

21:34.476 --> 21:36.944
By reichsfuhrer himmler himself.

21:36.979 --> 21:40.347
Congratulations. What an honor.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.884
Isn't the view
beautiful, helene?

21:43.919 --> 21:46.486
I selected this property.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.488
Personally for the
obergruppenfuhrer.

21:48.524 --> 21:51.758
As soon as I heard
you enjoyed hunting,

21:51.794 --> 21:54.561
I knew this was the one.
Surrounded by woods.

21:54.597 --> 21:56.663
I adore nature.

21:56.699 --> 22:00.100
When I was a girl, I wanted
to be leni riefenstahl.

22:00.135 --> 22:03.236
Being out here, on your land...

22:05.774 --> 22:08.575
It fills me with hope
for lebensraum.

22:08.611 --> 22:11.745
Finally reclaiming what is ours.

22:11.780 --> 22:15.248
Exactly.

22:15.284 --> 22:18.585
Being out here reminds me
why poetry was invented.

22:18.621 --> 22:21.288
I feel my soul searching
for something...

22:21.323 --> 22:23.457
Transcendent.

22:23.492 --> 22:25.459
And pure.

22:25.494 --> 22:27.761
Sabine was right.

22:27.796 --> 22:29.763
You do have the soul of a poet.

22:29.798 --> 22:33.200
Perhaps we'd have better luck
if the pheasants.

22:33.235 --> 22:35.736
Don't hear us coming.

22:35.771 --> 22:39.106
I'm sorry. Shall we?

22:42.411 --> 22:45.545
Out! Get out!

22:45.581 --> 22:49.216
No! Out!

22:49.251 --> 22:51.885
Please don't hurt her!
Don't hurt her!

22:56.425 --> 22:58.558
Rd? Rd means they're.

22:58.594 --> 23:01.228
To be sent away to do farm work
for the incoming settlers.

23:01.263 --> 23:03.897
Kowalski. Mark that one kl.

23:03.932 --> 23:07.467
That's concentration camp.

23:17.546 --> 23:20.847
Edsel!

23:20.883 --> 23:25.819
Dieter. Hey! Hi. Jorn.

23:25.854 --> 23:27.754
We had no idea
you were in poland.

23:27.790 --> 23:30.424
Small world.
What are you doing here?

23:30.459 --> 23:33.160
I work with brigadefuhrer faber.

23:33.195 --> 23:36.363
Whoa! You've come a long way
from klv camp.

23:36.398 --> 23:39.032
How about you? We're hoping.

23:39.068 --> 23:40.868
To get into the ss.
Boys. When you evict them,

23:40.903 --> 23:43.036
Make sure they leave
their belongings behind.

23:43.072 --> 23:45.172
We don't want the settlers
arriving to empty homes.

23:45.207 --> 23:47.207
Yes, herr polizeifuhrer. Move!

23:47.242 --> 23:49.476
Come on! Help! Help! Let me go!

23:49.511 --> 23:52.779
Excuse us.

23:52.815 --> 23:55.549
Help!

24:07.863 --> 24:11.331
Mama? Help!

24:11.366 --> 24:13.967
Ania? Mama!

24:14.002 --> 24:17.170
Mama! Stop!

24:17.206 --> 24:19.339
Please!

24:19.374 --> 24:22.342
Ania! Mama!

24:22.377 --> 24:25.078
Where are you taking her?

24:25.114 --> 24:27.948
Go!

24:31.019 --> 24:34.254
Mama!

24:36.291 --> 24:38.959
There could be
more children inside.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.245
Thank you.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.926
So close! The next one is yours.

25:12.961 --> 25:15.428
Again!

25:27.943 --> 25:30.544
That's enough.

25:30.579 --> 25:34.447
It's time.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.952
You, run.

25:41.256 --> 25:43.323
It's more fun if you run.

25:52.835 --> 25:55.535
Come on!

26:16.525 --> 26:19.860
We've got a better chance
if we split up.

26:19.895 --> 26:23.697
Take the north end.
We'll cover this side.

26:23.732 --> 26:27.200
Wait for my signal.
Stay with him.

26:29.638 --> 26:32.272
Move! Let's go!

26:50.859 --> 26:55.061
Come on.

26:55.097 --> 26:58.031
We're right behind you.

27:20.589 --> 27:23.290
Come on!

27:52.220 --> 27:53.386
You've found him.

27:56.058 --> 27:59.592
What are you waiting for?

28:01.730 --> 28:05.699
It doesn't seem right
to shoot a wounded man.

28:05.734 --> 28:08.601
There's no challenge!

28:08.637 --> 28:11.738
No! This is helene's prize.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.240
Go ahead.

28:16.578 --> 28:19.813
He's all yours, helene. The
privilege of true aryan blood.

28:52.381 --> 28:55.348
Well done, helene.

28:55.384 --> 28:57.417
All this fresh air has
worked up my appetite.

28:57.452 --> 28:59.419
I have some venison
back at the house.

28:59.454 --> 29:01.521
Sounds delicious.

29:01.556 --> 29:03.623
Do you like venison, helene?

29:03.658 --> 29:06.393
I love it.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.468
Keep your position! Go, go!

29:26.473 --> 29:29.107
It's okay.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.814
Don't be afraid.
I'm here to help.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.979
Have the reinforcements arrived?

30:08.015 --> 30:09.981
This was supposed to be.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.983
A cut-and-dry operation.
That's why I sent you.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.985
Instead of going myself!

30:14.021 --> 30:16.321
Stay there. I'm on my way.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.423
There you are!

30:18.459 --> 30:20.826
Could we please go home?
I can't talk now.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.994
All these women talk about is
babies and drapery.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.996
I'm going out of my mind!
Give my apologies.

30:25.032 --> 30:29.234
To your father,
but I have urgent business.

30:33.807 --> 30:36.475
There they are!

30:45.119 --> 30:47.152
Cover us!

30:53.193 --> 30:55.427
Fall back! Fall back!

30:55.462 --> 30:58.997
No! Tomek!

31:14.681 --> 31:17.983
Tomek!

31:21.088 --> 31:23.588
Tomek!

31:25.893 --> 31:27.893
We need to regroup
with the others.

31:27.928 --> 31:31.530
I'll find alfred.

32:08.902 --> 32:12.804
<i>Alfred!</i>

32:24.184 --> 32:26.151
Helene. I wanted to thank you.

32:26.186 --> 32:28.987
For a memorable day.

32:29.022 --> 32:32.123
The pleasure was all mine.

32:32.159 --> 32:35.727
It's been wonderful
getting to know you better.

32:35.762 --> 32:38.763
I've been asked to bring
a companion with me.

32:38.799 --> 32:41.866
To the anniversary gala
in berlin.

32:41.902 --> 32:44.102
Someone who exemplifies.

32:44.137 --> 32:46.137
The values of the reich.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.306
I'd be honored if you would.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.308
Accompany me on such
a special occasion.

32:50.344 --> 32:54.446
I'd arrange your travel
and accommodation, of course.

32:54.481 --> 32:56.948
If you would consider it.

32:56.984 --> 32:59.117
Thank you.

32:59.152 --> 33:01.586
That would be lovely.

33:01.622 --> 33:05.457
Herr brigadefuhrer!

33:05.492 --> 33:07.559
There could still be snipers.
We have to go.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.961
Where are the other men?
Retreating.

33:09.997 --> 33:13.632
Please, herr brigadefuhrer.
For your own safety.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.101
Go. I'll follow you.

33:38.125 --> 33:40.191
Fritz.

33:45.132 --> 33:47.966
I didn't think you'd make it
out of the woods.

33:48.001 --> 33:51.002
Are you proud of
what you've done?

33:51.038 --> 33:54.606
I wasn't here. Yes, you were.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.108
I didn't fight.

33:57.144 --> 33:59.644
A brigadefuhrer
doesn't need to fight.

33:59.680 --> 34:03.515
That's what
his soldiers are for.

34:03.550 --> 34:06.818
But you're the one
who killed my men.

34:06.853 --> 34:10.288
You are the one
who made the children orphans.

34:10.324 --> 34:12.791
You are the monster.

34:12.826 --> 34:14.826
Your soldiers are dead, fritz.

34:14.860 --> 34:17.629
We killed them.

34:17.664 --> 34:21.399
And we're going to keep
killing them and pushing you.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.601
Out of our homes.

34:28.007 --> 34:32.377
What are you waiting for, fritz?

34:32.411 --> 34:35.714
Aren't you going to shoot me?

34:52.132 --> 34:54.232
Be careful.

35:11.251 --> 35:13.485
Mama! Where are you?

35:15.489 --> 35:17.956
You all right? Yes.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.458
Where's alfred?

35:20.494 --> 35:22.994
Inside.

35:26.767 --> 35:29.734
Do you see your mother?

35:29.770 --> 35:33.071
Jurek! Mama!

36:05.806 --> 36:07.806
Alfred?

36:14.481 --> 36:17.115
Alfred.

36:17.150 --> 36:19.951
It's okay. It's over.

36:19.987 --> 36:21.953
We pushed them back.

36:21.989 --> 36:23.955
We've held the town.

36:23.991 --> 36:26.591
Come on.

36:42.943 --> 36:46.778
These grade well.
There will be more soon.

37:13.473 --> 37:17.309
What is your name?

37:17.344 --> 37:20.912
Ania nowak. Age 6. Ania nowak.

37:23.483 --> 37:25.750
I think she needs
a good german name.

37:32.726 --> 37:34.726
She's the one.

37:34.761 --> 37:37.562
I'll have the papers complete
by morning.

37:40.567 --> 37:42.934
Hello? Sabine?

37:46.039 --> 37:48.239
Herr obergruppenfuhrer. Papa!

37:48.275 --> 37:50.342
I apologize for calling on you
at such a late hour.

37:50.377 --> 37:53.912
What are you doing here?
I can't stay.

37:53.947 --> 37:56.448
But I have a special delivery
I wanted to make myself.

38:12.632 --> 38:15.700
I would like you to meet dagna.

38:15.736 --> 38:18.737
She is healthy, obedient,

38:18.772 --> 38:21.940
And she needs a family. I think
she will be very happy here.

38:21.975 --> 38:24.242
Won't you, dagna?

38:24.277 --> 38:26.711
Franz and sabine are very nice
to have you live here,

38:26.747 --> 38:29.314
Aren't they?

38:29.349 --> 38:33.051
Are you going to say thank you?

38:35.522 --> 38:38.957
Well. I will
see you all tomorrow.

38:38.992 --> 38:40.992
Good night.

38:50.971 --> 38:53.438
Franz!

38:53.473 --> 38:55.473
Don't just walk away!

39:05.352 --> 39:08.753
I say we go
after those bastards.

39:08.789 --> 39:10.822
We hit them again.

39:10.857 --> 39:13.625
We're trying
to defend the towns.

39:13.660 --> 39:16.828
Not make them targets
for reprisals.

39:19.032 --> 39:21.933
Where are their bodies?

39:21.968 --> 39:25.770
We are digging the graves.

39:25.806 --> 39:28.440
We'll help.

39:28.475 --> 39:30.775
Anything you need.

39:30.811 --> 39:33.478
Good.

39:36.316 --> 39:38.483
Tonight, we grieve and rest.

39:38.518 --> 39:42.220
Tomorrow,

39:42.255 --> 39:45.223
We keep fighting.

39:48.328 --> 39:51.329
What happened?

39:53.333 --> 39:55.400
The germans are gone.
We held the town.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.302
Good.

39:57.337 --> 40:00.505
What is it?

40:03.009 --> 40:04.976
There were so many people.

40:05.011 --> 40:07.812
Children. A little boy
on the floor. They killed him.

40:07.848 --> 40:11.316
I saw a woman running
after her daughter,

40:11.351 --> 40:13.318
And the germans shot her.

40:13.353 --> 40:15.854
I can't stop seeing her face.
Every time I close my eyes...

40:15.889 --> 40:19.357
Stop, please! What?

40:24.531 --> 40:27.765
What happened? Tell me.

40:27.801 --> 40:31.102
Just tell neil I got invited
to a gala in berlin.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.272
And voigt will be there.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.107
We've got a chance
to get this done.

40:36.142 --> 40:39.944
We're leaving tomorrow.

41:01.167 --> 41:05.937
What the hell do you want?

41:16.016 --> 41:19.117
How do you do it?

41:19.152 --> 41:21.386
Get out.

41:21.421 --> 41:24.622
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

41:24.658 --> 41:28.059
What do you want me to do?

41:28.094 --> 41:30.094
What? Do you want me to say it?

41:30.130 --> 41:32.397
You want me to say
that I'm a monster, is that it?

41:32.432 --> 41:36.067
Your hands aren't clean either.

41:36.102 --> 41:39.304
You're just like me
and you know it.
