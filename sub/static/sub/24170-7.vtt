WEBVTT

00:00.314 --> 00:01.581
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:01.650 --> 00:04.718
- Charlotte, don't!
- Mayday, mayday. Officer down.

00:04.745 --> 00:06.406
When a mayday is called,
you get out immediately.

00:06.433 --> 00:07.366
It was the right thing to do.

00:07.391 --> 00:08.767
You are getting sicker.

00:08.792 --> 00:10.259
My brother. He's been
living on the streets.

00:10.284 --> 00:11.217
I don't know what to do.

00:11.250 --> 00:12.283
I think I'm scared of fire.

00:12.352 --> 00:13.853
We can run simulations on our days off.

00:13.922 --> 00:15.523
Yeah, I know some drills
we can try out here, too.

00:15.592 --> 00:17.126
- Ryan's kind of great.
- He is.

00:17.195 --> 00:18.964
What are you gonna do?

00:22.372 --> 00:25.567
Go with the flow.
Wear life loosely. Let it be.

00:25.636 --> 00:28.470
These are not easy concepts
for most firefighters.

00:28.495 --> 00:30.196
This is my sixth birthday party today.

00:30.266 --> 00:31.499
I can't do it.

00:31.568 --> 00:34.500
If I have to sing
that stupid song one more time,

00:34.525 --> 00:36.227
I'm gonna quit.

00:36.296 --> 00:37.897
Okay, you won't quit. You will sing.

00:37.966 --> 00:39.333
No one's even paying attention to you.

00:39.402 --> 00:40.635
They're all taking pictures of their kid

00:40.705 --> 00:42.439
or their girlfriend or whatever.

00:42.508 --> 00:43.809
Let's get this over with.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.378
We're trained to go after a problem...

00:45.447 --> 00:47.549
attack it, to stamp it out.

00:48.031 --> 00:49.064
But that doesn't always work.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.835
Now, where are those Flanner's Manners?

00:50.903 --> 00:53.640
Happy faces, whappy customers! Fine.

00:53.709 --> 00:55.778
Sometimes we're not the ones in control.

00:58.953 --> 01:00.354
We have to go with the flow

01:00.423 --> 01:02.291
and just put our game faces on...

01:02.360 --> 01:05.498
Hi! We're the...

01:08.151 --> 01:09.218
...and see what happens.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.351 --> 01:25.687
Hey, I was on my way out
when they paged me.

01:25.756 --> 01:27.424
Now, what symptoms are you experiencing?

01:27.492 --> 01:29.027
Well, some nausea.

01:29.096 --> 01:31.098
- Weakness. I've... I've been dizzy.
- Mm.

01:31.167 --> 01:34.371
I was hoping you could write me
a prescription or something,

01:34.440 --> 01:35.883
clear me up before work tomorrow.

01:35.952 --> 01:38.532
Or I could give you a full work-up,

01:38.557 --> 01:40.024
get your oncology team on the phone,

01:40.094 --> 01:41.094
and see what's really going on.

01:41.163 --> 01:42.763
No, I don't want more tests.

01:42.832 --> 01:44.500
I just want a prescription.

01:44.569 --> 01:47.306
I can't treat your problem
if I don't know the problem.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.011
These could all be side effects
from your treatment

01:50.081 --> 01:53.351
or indicators of something more serious.

01:53.385 --> 01:56.054
Look, the chemo makes you
susceptible to infections,

01:56.123 --> 01:58.893
which can cause your kidneys, your heart,

01:58.962 --> 02:00.897
your nervous system to malfunction.

02:00.966 --> 02:05.205
So, if you found something
more serious, you'd admit me?

02:05.274 --> 02:07.811
- Keep me here?
- Most likely. Yes.

02:11.321 --> 02:13.188
You know, I, uh...

02:13.725 --> 02:18.232
I-I think I probably didn't need
to come in, after all.

02:18.301 --> 02:19.401
False alarm.

02:19.470 --> 02:22.207
So, sorry to waste your time, Dr. Bailey.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.409
Good night.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.199
Okay.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.518
Where have you been?

02:40.587 --> 02:42.355
Uh, poker night.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.906
With some of the guys in the department.

02:44.975 --> 02:46.443
Hey. How'd your test go?

02:46.468 --> 02:48.120
A guy on my team went down,

02:48.145 --> 02:50.280
and a firefighter from 12 called mayday

02:50.305 --> 02:52.842
before I had my dummy, so...

02:52.897 --> 02:54.833
I stayed behind to find it.

02:55.228 --> 02:56.830
You broke mayday protocol

02:56.899 --> 02:59.201
in front of judges who'll decide
if you make captain?

02:59.270 --> 03:00.938
Who was proctoring the test? Frankel?

03:01.007 --> 03:02.875
- And the fire chief.
- Oh. Ripley.

03:04.548 --> 03:06.550
Not an easy man to impress.

03:06.619 --> 03:10.190
Yeah. They ranked me dead last, Dad.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.860
Out of all 20 candidates.

03:11.929 --> 03:14.031
But I'm fine. I'm still in this thing.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.805
I just have to kick ass from now on.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.131
Every call, every shift.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.901
It is the sign of a real competitor.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.095
I am proud of you.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.331
I just wish the team
would see it that way.

03:23.376 --> 03:25.913
I know they're gonna look at me
with "loser eyes."

03:25.982 --> 03:28.151
I don't want loser eyes.
I don't want pity.

03:28.704 --> 03:30.038
That's why I'm glad we can do this...

03:30.107 --> 03:32.677
go give out vaccines, not think about it.

03:32.746 --> 03:36.450
What... What about you? How are you
feeling about maybe seeing your brother?

03:36.520 --> 03:38.522
Well, uh, he's either gonna look at me

03:38.591 --> 03:41.193
with "Long time no see,
I missed you so much, sis" eyes,

03:41.262 --> 03:43.197
or "You abandoned me just like
everyone else in my life,

03:43.266 --> 03:44.901
so I hate you now" eyes.

03:44.970 --> 03:46.805
No telling. It should be fun.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.638
Si desarrolla una infección
o fiebre, vaya a la clinica.

03:56.707 --> 03:58.241
Es gratis.

03:58.310 --> 04:00.891
Your ambulance sure is nice and shiny.

04:02.652 --> 04:03.719
Mason.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.813
It's been a while.

04:06.882 --> 04:08.049
You look good.

04:08.118 --> 04:09.585
You never were a good liar.

04:09.654 --> 04:11.651
Hey. I'm Andy.

04:16.034 --> 04:17.267
We can't stay long.

04:17.336 --> 04:19.071
We got to get back before shift starts.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.007
You want a Hepatitis vaccine
before we go?

04:21.077 --> 04:22.177
They're quick and free.

04:22.246 --> 04:24.014
- No needles.
- I'm... I'm... I'm good.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.335
Okay, well, just let me know
if you change your mind.

04:28.191 --> 04:29.793
I'm not using.

04:30.348 --> 04:31.582
I haven't been for a while.

04:31.651 --> 04:33.352
I brought some stuff,
in case I ran into you.

04:33.421 --> 04:35.056
Just food, blankets, clothes.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.394
I don't want handouts.

04:37.736 --> 04:38.937
I'm just fine on my own.

04:39.005 --> 04:40.807
You're not fine.
You're living on the street.

04:40.876 --> 04:41.976
So?

04:42.045 --> 04:43.045
Come live with me.

04:43.113 --> 04:44.982
- We can figure this out.
- Why?

04:45.051 --> 04:47.642
Because you can't see me
living like this?

04:47.667 --> 04:48.601
Because this isn't the life

04:48.669 --> 04:50.938
you imagined for your little brother?

04:51.007 --> 04:53.143
I have people that care about me.

04:53.476 --> 04:55.211
They just happen to live around here.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.848
I'm doing what makes me feel good.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.586
I'm painting again. I'm creating.

04:59.655 --> 05:02.626
Like you said, you haven't
seen me in a long while.

05:03.065 --> 05:05.234
You don't know me or what I need.

05:05.303 --> 05:07.272
Mason. I care.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.807
Then get off your freaking high horse

05:08.876 --> 05:10.144
and leave me alone.

05:15.557 --> 05:16.991
Meditation can help you
get over your fear

05:17.060 --> 05:18.227
if you actual ditate.

05:18.296 --> 05:19.663
Oh, don't drag me out of bed this early

05:19.731 --> 05:21.366
and expect me to do anything but sleep.

05:21.435 --> 05:22.735
Sorry. I just...

05:23.175 --> 05:24.742
Do we... We know each other, right?

05:24.811 --> 05:26.179
Yeah, the... the nursing home.

05:26.248 --> 05:27.982
- My grandmother.
- You're Edith's grandson.

05:28.051 --> 05:31.423
- Grant.
- Yes! Travis. I'm Travis.

05:31.491 --> 05:33.427
I remember.

05:33.856 --> 05:34.990
I'm Vic. Hello.

05:35.059 --> 05:36.059
Hi. Sorry.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.294
Oh, my class is starting,

05:37.363 --> 05:39.432
but hopefully I'll see you again.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.575
Maybe we could exchange numbers?

05:43.385 --> 05:44.718
That sounds lovely!

05:44.787 --> 05:45.914
- Travis?
- Yeah.

05:45.983 --> 05:47.054
Right? I mean, uh...

05:47.123 --> 05:48.559
- Here.
- Oh.

05:48.628 --> 05:49.708
In case you're interested.

05:53.104 --> 05:54.939
Damn, Trav!

05:55.008 --> 05:56.676
Those are some digits!

05:56.744 --> 05:58.620
Yeah. Yeah.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.227
"Yeah". Just "yeah"? That's it?

06:00.296 --> 06:02.163
I mean, he seems nice.

06:02.233 --> 06:03.800
But, I mean, he's a yoga guy,

06:03.869 --> 06:05.002
and I'm into meditation,

06:05.071 --> 06:08.101
so we're obviously totally incompatible.

06:09.614 --> 06:11.181
Well, obviously.

06:11.251 --> 06:13.653
I can't believe that was the
first game I made it to this season.

06:13.722 --> 06:15.025
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, Tuck used that

06:15.050 --> 06:16.845
crossover dribble I taught him,

06:16.870 --> 06:18.037
and he missed the shot, but, you know...

06:18.105 --> 06:19.941
Hey, where's Pruitt?

06:20.009 --> 06:21.878
Should be in soon. Why?
Is something going on?

06:21.947 --> 06:24.115
No. Why would anything be going on?

06:24.583 --> 06:26.986
He's seemed perfectly okay lately, right?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.656
Do you have reason
to think he's not okay?

06:28.725 --> 06:30.258
Did you see him
for an appointment or something?

06:30.327 --> 06:32.329
I-I did see him...

06:32.398 --> 06:34.586
where I happened to be.

06:36.306 --> 06:38.475
Would "where you happened to be"

06:38.821 --> 06:40.290
happen to be the hospital?

06:40.358 --> 06:43.829
Okay, you know I cannot talk
about my patients with you,

06:43.898 --> 06:46.000
or whether or not they
might have come to see me,

06:46.069 --> 06:49.564
but left instead of getting
their recommended work-up.

06:49.589 --> 06:51.608
And I definitely cannot suggest

06:51.677 --> 06:54.034
that one of Pruitt's
co-workers, maybe someone

06:54.059 --> 06:55.172
- who used to be a surgeon...
- Hmm.

06:55.217 --> 06:56.952
...let's say, should keep an extra eye

06:57.021 --> 06:59.791
since I wasn't able to
spend the proper time

06:59.860 --> 07:04.367
with my patient at the place
where I happened to see him.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.528
And here I thought you wanted to
take your husband to work,

07:07.596 --> 07:09.665
spend more time with him.

07:09.734 --> 07:12.538
Today you're not the firefighter
I'm worried about.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.915
What are we supposed to say to Herrera?

07:20.984 --> 07:22.585
Well, I'd suggest you don't lead with,

07:22.654 --> 07:23.955
"Aw, I'm so sorry you blew your chance

07:24.024 --> 07:25.624
at a career you always wanted."

07:25.694 --> 07:27.763
I don't understand. Tests are
basically her favorite hobby.

07:27.831 --> 07:29.800
She made a tough call.
I would've done the same thing.

07:29.869 --> 07:31.503
Morning, everybody!

07:33.710 --> 07:36.722
Okay, no, no, we're not doing this.

07:36.762 --> 07:39.632
Yes, I failed the Incinerator,
but I don't feel sorry for me,

07:39.701 --> 07:41.636
so you certainly don't get to.

07:41.705 --> 07:43.574
Got it?

07:43.642 --> 07:45.644
Warren, Montgomery,
routine rig maintenance.

07:45.713 --> 07:47.807
Every vehicle, bumper to bumper.
You know the drill.

07:47.832 --> 07:49.901
And we're coordinating with Seattle PD

07:49.970 --> 07:51.905
for the upcoming
disaster simulation drill.

07:51.974 --> 07:53.141
Reps are stopping by later.

07:53.209 --> 07:54.978
Miller, I want you on that with me.

07:55.047 --> 07:56.182
Yeah. Sounds good.

07:56.251 --> 07:58.418
Everyone else, chores.

08:03.196 --> 08:04.229
How you feeling?

08:04.298 --> 08:06.233
Feeling good.

08:06.302 --> 08:08.471
Full steam ahead. Never better.

08:17.124 --> 08:19.477
How concerned do you think
a person needs to be

08:19.502 --> 08:21.939
if they're experiencing nausea,
in your medical opinion?

08:22.008 --> 08:23.375
Did you eat something weird?

08:26.283 --> 08:27.716
I'm serious.

08:27.785 --> 08:29.520
You're talking about Pruitt, aren't you?

08:32.794 --> 08:34.196
What exactly is going on?

08:34.265 --> 08:37.568
We just, um... We just
wanted a more private spot,

08:37.638 --> 08:40.042
uh, to talk.

08:40.110 --> 08:43.515
Yeah, we've noticed that
you haven't been exactly, um...

08:43.582 --> 08:46.287
feeling well, sir.

08:46.356 --> 08:48.892
Surprise. I have cancer.
Look, I'm getting back to work.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.898
Sir, you were sick last shift,
and you tried to hide it.

08:51.968 --> 08:53.601
- You left early.
- I did. I saw my doctor.

08:53.670 --> 08:56.207
And did your doctor advise you
to return to work today?

08:56.276 --> 08:57.643
If your symptoms
are suddenly accelerating,

08:57.712 --> 08:58.712
it is my medical opinion...

08:58.780 --> 09:00.549
I am handling this in my own way,

09:00.617 --> 09:02.152
on my own time.

09:02.221 --> 09:03.822
We're done here.

09:03.890 --> 09:04.857
Ohh. Sir.

09:04.927 --> 09:06.594
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:06.663 --> 09:07.663
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

09:07.732 --> 09:09.266
- Get off.
- Dad, you okay?

09:09.335 --> 09:11.371
- Get off!
- They are overreacting.

09:11.439 --> 09:12.840
Your dad's having
an increase in symptoms.

09:12.908 --> 09:15.045
We think it's best if he gets to
the hospital to get checked out.

09:15.114 --> 09:16.681
Don't be ridiculous! This is ridiculous!

09:16.750 --> 09:18.118
Are you sure?

09:18.186 --> 09:20.022
- Then I'm coming with you.
- Andrea.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.391
You are captain today,

09:21.459 --> 09:22.994
and you're on thin ice
after the Incinerator test.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.363
You can't just leave.

09:24.432 --> 09:27.102
Let the know-it-all rookie
here take me. You stay here.

09:27.171 --> 09:29.073
This is a bad idea. You think
about what's important.

09:29.142 --> 09:31.544
I am, Dad. Let's go.

09:33.383 --> 09:40.454
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

09:42.413 --> 09:43.881
For God's sake, stop doting.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.366
Dad, why didn't you tell me

09:45.434 --> 09:47.054
you were feeling worse after everything?

09:47.123 --> 09:50.327
I didn't want to make a fuss,
but here we are... a fuss.

09:50.396 --> 09:52.599
Okay. I-I'll be right outside

09:52.668 --> 09:54.068
if you need anything.

09:56.308 --> 09:58.995
Mr. Herrera, your labs showed

09:59.063 --> 10:02.485
an increase in your CA-125 biomarker.

10:02.553 --> 10:05.124
That is a sign that
your cancer is progressing

10:05.192 --> 10:08.698
and no longer responding
to your current treatment.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.434
Like I said two weeks ago,

10:10.503 --> 10:12.673
your oncology team and I think it's time

10:12.741 --> 10:15.010
to consider a higher dose of chemo.

10:15.079 --> 10:16.279
¿Semanas?

10:16.348 --> 10:18.417
¿Te has sentido así
de enfermo por semanas?

10:18.485 --> 10:21.596
Um, what the new treatment would entail

10:21.621 --> 10:23.156
is adding an additional agent

10:23.225 --> 10:25.160
to your current combination
of chemo drugs.

10:25.229 --> 10:27.765
- Another agent?
- Yes, it's called cisplatin.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.370
Um, it increases the potency
of the treatment.

10:30.439 --> 10:31.706
It's aggressive.

10:31.775 --> 10:34.312
Like hitting a fire
with every hose in the city

10:34.380 --> 10:35.547
all at once.

10:35.616 --> 10:38.118
Side effects ranging from
mild skin irritation

10:38.188 --> 10:41.559
to seizures to heart complications

10:41.628 --> 10:42.695
and shock.

10:42.763 --> 10:45.367
Can his body handle all of that?

10:45.436 --> 10:47.304
Are there more options? Other tests?

10:47.373 --> 10:48.673
We've been through them all.

10:48.742 --> 10:50.811
Like I was telling your father
night before last...

10:50.879 --> 10:52.715
"Night before last"?

10:52.783 --> 10:53.883
Huh!

10:53.952 --> 10:55.119
When you were at poker night?

10:55.189 --> 10:56.589
How I deal with this
is none of your business.

10:56.658 --> 10:58.326
- Déjalo ser.
- Let it be?

10:58.395 --> 11:00.931
Ya sabes que no puedo haer eso.
You're sick, Dad.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.201
- I'm taking care of it!
- No, you're not!

11:02.270 --> 11:03.603
You're not taking care of anything!

11:03.672 --> 11:05.440
- Look at you!
- Okay, stop. No.

11:05.509 --> 11:07.611
No yelling. No fighting. Not in here.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.684
Uh, Andy, we'll be in here
all day long today.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.187
So if you need a minute...

11:14.560 --> 11:16.396
- Thank you, Dr. Bailey.
- Don't thank me.

11:16.464 --> 11:18.032
She's loud, but she's right.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.621
Talk to your damn daughter.

11:20.372 --> 11:21.773
Hey, everything okay?

11:21.841 --> 11:22.908
No, no, no.

11:22.977 --> 11:24.545
My dad's getting worse
and hiding it from me.

11:24.614 --> 11:26.582
And now Dr. Bailey's saying
they want to start him

11:26.651 --> 11:28.255
on this new treatment
that sounds risky, and...

11:28.280 --> 11:29.915
Okay, she wouldn't suggest anything

11:29.960 --> 11:31.258
if she didn't believe it
could make a difference.

11:31.283 --> 11:33.463
I just... I just feel like we're
jumping to the most extreme option.

11:33.532 --> 11:35.467
Okay, look. Treatments like this
are really hard for patients.

11:35.536 --> 11:37.404
But, uh... Yes.

11:37.473 --> 11:39.475
Do you want to talk through the steps?

11:39.544 --> 11:40.844
You can ask me questions.

11:40.913 --> 11:42.013
I-I know a lot about this kind of...

11:42.082 --> 11:44.552
Don't... Don't... Don't do that.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.556
Don't coddle me.

11:46.624 --> 11:49.027
I'm not some frightened
family member, Warren.

11:49.096 --> 11:50.530
I don't need to be handled.

11:54.874 --> 11:58.546
Hey, Edith. Your foot
bothering you again?

11:58.615 --> 12:01.486
Uh, I'm having trouble breathing.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.425
All right. Let's get you checked out.

12:04.450 --> 12:06.084
All right, take a deep breath in for me,

12:06.109 --> 12:07.623
and then back out.

12:08.809 --> 12:10.744
Like you did in yoga this morning?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.070
What?

12:17.150 --> 12:19.986
Are you gonna call my grandson or not?

12:20.055 --> 12:21.457
I know he ran into you.

12:21.525 --> 12:24.896
Apparently, you didn't seem
anxious to take his number.

12:26.034 --> 12:27.368
Don't be a fool.

12:27.437 --> 12:28.604
He's a catch.

12:28.673 --> 12:30.541
Why wouldn't you want to go out with him?

12:30.610 --> 12:32.735
BP's looking good, Edith.

12:33.349 --> 12:36.987
I mean, he's athletic,
he's sweet, and he's a chef.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.257
Grams, you okay?

12:38.326 --> 12:41.096
I just got your message.
I got here as soon as...

12:41.165 --> 12:43.032
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:43.102 --> 12:44.669
Is s-she okay? What's wrong with her?

12:44.738 --> 12:47.809
Oh, no. False alarm, honey.

12:47.878 --> 12:50.545
Oh, I feel much better now.

12:53.322 --> 12:56.560
A lot of extra gadgets today.

12:56.629 --> 12:59.675
Because this dosage will be more intense.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.434
Older patients tend to have a harder time

13:01.503 --> 13:02.537
with a treatment like this, so...

13:02.605 --> 13:03.806
What Dr. Schmitt means

13:03.875 --> 13:05.810
is that we just want to
keep an eye on you,

13:05.879 --> 13:08.716
keep your levels under control.

13:08.785 --> 13:11.756
It's nothing. I've faced
much worse many times.

13:11.824 --> 13:12.925
Like with that roof collapse.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.028
They all came back buzzing about it.

13:15.053 --> 13:16.053
I told them, "This is nothing,

13:16.122 --> 13:18.024
not when you've seen what I've seen."

13:18.093 --> 13:20.495
Right, that... roof collapse.

13:20.564 --> 13:22.532
My point being, it... it...
it makes you tougher.

13:22.601 --> 13:23.869
I-It prepares you.

13:23.938 --> 13:25.105
I'm strong.

13:25.173 --> 13:26.540
Dr. Bailey, I can handle this treatment.

13:26.609 --> 13:30.081
Um, remind me, when was
the roof thing again?

13:30.150 --> 13:32.319
Uh, a few weeks back, maybe.

13:32.388 --> 13:35.258
Either before or after
that big tanker spill.

13:35.327 --> 13:37.830
Definitely before that terrible
business with the power lines.

13:37.899 --> 13:41.437
You would know about that.
That one hit Warren pretty hard.

13:41.506 --> 13:43.776
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

13:43.844 --> 13:46.447
Hey, I just came in to check in and...

13:46.516 --> 13:49.771
Hang on. Herrera didn't come back?

13:51.459 --> 13:52.727
Excuse me.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.370
- Gibson, PD reps are here.
- Yeah, okay.

14:05.439 --> 14:07.875
- Hey. I'm Officer Reis.
- Jack Gibson.

14:07.943 --> 14:09.778
I was just going over the
disaster drill protocols.

14:09.847 --> 14:12.317
This is my partner, Officer Ryan Tanner.

14:12.995 --> 14:14.597
Yeah, no, we, uh... we know each other.

14:14.665 --> 14:15.899
Isn't this Captain Herrera's shift?

14:15.968 --> 14:17.736
Herrera was called away today.

14:17.805 --> 14:19.607
You got me.

14:19.675 --> 14:22.148
But good to know you're
so up on her schedule.

14:22.175 --> 14:23.677
Hope you're just as prepped
on this drill.

14:23.745 --> 14:25.079
Oh, he's always prepared.

14:25.148 --> 14:27.383
Bit of a Boy Scout, really,
in a good way.

14:27.452 --> 14:28.619
I don't mean to diminish his authority

14:28.689 --> 14:30.590
by calling him a boy. Is everything okay?

14:30.916 --> 14:32.651
- To make Andy step away?
- Personal business.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.132
Nothing you need to
concern yourself with.

14:34.157 --> 14:35.924
I am, though. Concerned.
Especially if it's personal...

14:35.993 --> 14:37.761
Pruitt's in the hospital.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.198
We're waiting to hear how it's going.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.601
She didn't mention anything about her dad

14:40.669 --> 14:42.371
when I saw her the night before last.

14:44.477 --> 14:46.880
Yeah, you know, I couldn't speak to that.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.689
Can we move this along?

14:51.479 --> 14:54.349
This year's drill will be a
mass-casualty disaster simulation.

14:54.418 --> 14:56.219
I've taken the liberty
of putting together a plan.

14:56.288 --> 14:57.555
Here's the problem with your plan.

14:57.624 --> 14:58.691
You haven't even heard it yet.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.162
I don't have to hear it. I can see it...

15:01.232 --> 15:03.099
and its problems.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.304
You can't know there's problems
until you've taken a closer look.

15:05.373 --> 15:06.940
You know, I'm picking up
on a definitive vibe here.

15:07.009 --> 15:10.348
I do that. I pick up on vibes.
I'm on track to make detective.

15:10.417 --> 15:12.585
What are they fighting over, exactly?

15:13.255 --> 15:15.024
Did Tanner steal his lunch?

15:15.092 --> 15:16.794
Or his car? He used to do that.

15:19.034 --> 15:21.336
Montgomery, I did tell you
Grant was a chef, right?

15:21.405 --> 15:22.906
I am not a chef.

15:22.975 --> 15:25.044
I just got promoted to line cook.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.925
He's very talented.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.531
Montgomery, you should
visit Grant at his restaurant.

15:29.599 --> 15:30.799
Really, it's... it's fine.

15:30.868 --> 15:34.173
Yeah, uh, Travis
is the best chef at Station 19.

15:34.242 --> 15:36.586
I'm definitely no professional.

15:37.649 --> 15:41.007
I mean, how hard can it be, Montgomery?

15:43.192 --> 15:46.563
I've had 87 1/2 years'
worth of experience,

15:46.632 --> 15:51.239
so I know a good match
when I see a good match.

15:51.308 --> 15:52.542
Right?

16:01.043 --> 16:01.977
Sorry about this.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.580
Oh. She means well.

16:06.487 --> 16:07.555
This morning, you asked me

16:07.624 --> 16:09.157
if I was interested in seeing you again,

16:09.226 --> 16:11.261
and the answer is yes.

16:11.330 --> 16:12.999
I am.

16:13.067 --> 16:15.470
That's great.

16:15.538 --> 16:17.842
Um, breakfast, maybe?

16:17.910 --> 16:19.812
What about tomorrow?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.998
That's soon.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.367
Too soon?

16:23.435 --> 16:25.137
No. Nope.

16:25.206 --> 16:27.678
I'll be in touch. Later.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.323
Well, now that you two
have figured that out,

16:31.392 --> 16:33.093
somebody give me my mirror.

16:33.162 --> 16:35.645
Cupid's got to look good for bingo.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.517
You think he'll take you
to breakfast or make it?

16:41.586 --> 16:43.254
Like, woo you with
his homemade brioche...

16:43.323 --> 16:44.723
I really don't want to talk about this.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.794
You do like Grant, right?

16:46.863 --> 16:48.030
Yeah, of course.

16:48.099 --> 16:50.869
So, and you did agree to,
you know, go on a date.

16:50.937 --> 16:53.841
- Yeah, I know.
- So, what is the problem?

16:54.063 --> 16:55.898
Does the fear creep in
before there's a fire?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.349
Do you anticipate the worst?

16:57.418 --> 16:58.551
I think you're anticipating the worst.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.021
Or is it getting caught by surprise

17:00.090 --> 17:02.338
- that's getting to you?
- I think he seems really nice.

17:07.729 --> 17:08.929
Why are we stopping here?

17:08.998 --> 17:10.967
Come on. Bishop's waiting.

17:12.638 --> 17:15.108
Okay, it's time to start
desensitizing you to fire.

17:15.176 --> 17:16.578
I will light up a torch.

17:16.646 --> 17:17.814
You douse it.

17:17.883 --> 17:20.452
- Ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

17:29.824 --> 17:32.160
Okay, now the torch to your right.

17:32.229 --> 17:33.462
You sure this is a good idea?

17:43.982 --> 17:46.585
Damn it! I dropped my line!

17:46.654 --> 17:48.522
Sometimes we have to give
our friends the help they need,

17:48.591 --> 17:50.693
not the help they want.

17:50.762 --> 17:53.232
Just seems like we could
ease her into it a bit.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.011
People don't always know
what's best for them.

17:59.261 --> 18:01.464
Aah! Okay, that's enough!

18:01.532 --> 18:03.101
Turn... I'm good! Turn it off now!

18:03.169 --> 18:04.636
Get back into it! Push past it!

18:04.705 --> 18:07.977
No, I need... I need to
move more slowly than this!

18:08.046 --> 18:09.713
Come on. Come on.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.472
No, this... this is not helping!

18:25.540 --> 18:27.274
You are not helping me!

18:27.343 --> 18:29.345
This will not help!

18:29.414 --> 18:31.844
Structure fire. Crossroads
Strip Mall. We got to go.

18:35.494 --> 18:37.629
- Did you run any of this by Herrera?
- I don't have to.

18:37.698 --> 18:39.132
I'm captain today.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.902
I'm not used to seeing him like this.

18:40.971 --> 18:43.750
If I wasn't so tired of listening
to it, I'd find it fascinating.

18:43.775 --> 18:45.643
- You know how she thinks?
- Yeah, yeah, I know how she thinks.

18:45.713 --> 18:47.413
25 minutes and counting.

18:47.482 --> 18:49.517
Structure fire. Crossroads Strip Mall.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.121
Oh, that was unfortunate timing.

18:51.190 --> 18:55.363
Officer Reis, Officer Tanner,
thank you for stopping by.

18:55.431 --> 18:57.600
Probably finish up the rest
of the logistics by e-mail?

18:57.669 --> 18:59.504
Excellent plan. E-mail.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.208
Fire at Crossroads Strip Mall.

19:01.277 --> 19:03.379
All units, please respond.

19:03.447 --> 19:06.418
Looks like we're going to the same place.

19:07.078 --> 19:08.211
Goody.

19:24.178 --> 19:27.149
Look, I-I wasn't trying to coddle you

19:27.218 --> 19:30.856
or treat you like any
other patient's family.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.755
I was... I was treating you like...

19:32.824 --> 19:34.057
well, like my family.

19:35.796 --> 19:38.667
Look, I-I understand that
you might not be in a place

19:38.736 --> 19:42.407
where you're able to be there
for your dad right now,

19:42.477 --> 19:47.258
but I also know that he needs you.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.237
This is only the beginning

19:49.307 --> 19:52.223
of a very difficult road for him.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.047
Yell at him later, all right?

19:54.116 --> 19:55.951
Yell at me right now if you want.

19:56.019 --> 19:57.042
I'd prefer if you didn't

19:57.067 --> 19:58.130
- yell at my wife.
- Mm.

19:58.175 --> 19:59.492
Look, do whatever you have to do,

19:59.560 --> 20:03.394
but then go in there
and be there for your dad.

20:06.541 --> 20:08.376
So we're clear,

20:08.445 --> 20:11.749
you are pretty much
the most annoying rookie

20:11.818 --> 20:13.185
I've ever worked with.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.361
I'll go talk to him.

20:34.266 --> 20:36.301
This is 19.
Fire's escalated to a 2-alarm.

20:36.370 --> 20:38.137
I need all available units.

20:40.111 --> 20:41.478
- Montgomery!
- Yeah?

20:41.547 --> 20:43.181
You and Hughes get that hose
hooked up and charged.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.350
We'll need 2 1/2 inch.

20:44.419 --> 20:45.854
The Big One. You got it.

20:54.439 --> 20:56.374
Hey, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy.

20:56.443 --> 20:58.145
Slow, deep breaths, okay?

20:58.213 --> 21:00.349
It came out of
nowhere. There was no warning.

21:00.418 --> 21:01.819
Just fire everywhere.

21:01.888 --> 21:03.021
How many people are still in there?

21:03.090 --> 21:04.992
Dinner rush. The place was packed.

21:05.061 --> 21:06.127
Get her on oxygen, stat.

21:06.196 --> 21:07.798
Reports of victims still inside.

21:07.866 --> 21:11.003
We've only got minutes before this
building is completely unsafe!

21:13.310 --> 21:16.181
I'm going in to get the
rest of the people out!

21:30.626 --> 21:32.394
Stay near the engine
and the hydrant, okay?

21:32.463 --> 21:33.731
Just watch the gauges.

21:33.799 --> 21:35.467
Vic, you don't have to
get any closer than that.

21:53.866 --> 21:55.066
Tanner, what are you doing?!

21:55.135 --> 21:56.636
You got no mask, no turnouts.

21:56.704 --> 21:58.339
Neither do the people inside!

22:07.211 --> 22:08.378
Thought you left.

22:08.447 --> 22:10.982
I... took a walk to cool off,

22:11.051 --> 22:13.086
so I could come be here for you.

22:13.156 --> 22:14.523
You don't have to be.
I'm not asking you to.

22:14.592 --> 22:16.894
I know. You'd prefer
if I just leave you alone.

22:16.963 --> 22:19.233
- That's not what I meant.
- You... You can... You can say

22:19.302 --> 22:21.102
that your life is... is your business

22:21.172 --> 22:23.341
and that you don't have to
share what's going on,

22:23.410 --> 22:25.278
but it's... it's my business, too.

22:25.347 --> 22:26.514
Mom is gone.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.190
You're all I have,
so I can't just ignore that.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.517
I'm not gonna just let it be.

22:31.586 --> 22:33.521
I wanted to tell you
when I got the all clear,

22:33.590 --> 22:36.560
- when I was finally cancer-free.
- I mean, it was you

22:36.629 --> 22:40.968
who taught me to tackle
the scary parts head on,

22:40.993 --> 22:42.962
to stand up to them, face them down.

22:43.030 --> 22:45.366
I-I don't want you to spare me.
I want you to include me.

22:45.435 --> 22:47.905
Maybe I can't. Maybe I need the space.

22:47.974 --> 22:49.341
- From what?
- From people

22:49.409 --> 22:51.813
watching me all the time,

22:51.882 --> 22:53.182
waiting for me to drop.

22:53.251 --> 22:55.386
For years, I was the strongest!

22:55.455 --> 22:57.291
You're still strong.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.801
- You can't fight cancer...
- It's just like...

22:58.871 --> 22:59.838
...without being strong.

22:59.906 --> 23:01.507
You should back off a little.

23:01.576 --> 23:03.244
I can't do that.

23:03.313 --> 23:05.048
It's not a request, Andrea.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.817
I'm telling you, I need some space here.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.590
And I'm saying no.

23:09.658 --> 23:11.973
- What?
- No. I can't.

23:11.998 --> 23:13.733
- Of course you can. I'm telling you to.
- I won't.

23:13.802 --> 23:14.968
- Why?
- Because.

23:15.037 --> 23:17.713
- That's not an answer.
- Because I promised Mom!

23:19.078 --> 23:21.916
Before she died, I promised her.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.922
And I'm not letting your ego
or your pride

23:24.990 --> 23:27.473
get in the way of me keeping my promise.

23:28.430 --> 23:30.032
Jack just messaged. They got a big call.

23:30.100 --> 23:33.173
This is the absolute worst time
for me to interrupt.

23:33.198 --> 23:34.700
You should go.

23:34.769 --> 23:37.037
- I'll... I'll stay here.
- Yeah.

23:42.383 --> 23:44.485
All entry points are blocked.
Stairs are engulfed.

23:44.554 --> 23:46.089
This fire keeps growing and growing.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.922
All firefighters, pull out.

23:47.947 --> 23:49.648
Repeat, pull out. We're going defensive.

23:49.717 --> 23:51.552
Wait. What are you doing?
People could still be in there.

23:51.621 --> 23:53.857
It's too dangerous to keep going back in.

23:53.925 --> 23:55.059
- Hey, hey!
- Get off!

23:55.128 --> 23:57.331
Do you see that smoke right there? Hmm?

23:57.400 --> 23:59.935
And the corner, it's black,
which means it's toxic.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.142
You'd be dead in five minutes
without a mask.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.177
Give me a mask!

24:04.246 --> 24:05.614
The building's verging on collapse.

24:09.724 --> 24:12.795
This is Gibson.
Move the perimeter back 20 feet.

24:12.863 --> 24:14.597
So we can't do anything else?

24:14.644 --> 24:16.379
We hit it with water,
stop it from spreading.

24:16.447 --> 24:17.915
But we've lost the building.

24:20.021 --> 24:21.389
I need everyone to back up!

24:21.457 --> 24:23.292
Station 15, 23.

24:23.361 --> 24:25.363
15, hit it from the beta.
23, hit it from the delta.

24:25.432 --> 24:27.366
We're gonna surround and drown.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.853
Hey, Gibson.

24:31.922 --> 24:33.172
- Structure's lost?
- Yes, sir.

24:33.242 --> 24:35.043
Surprised to see you in charge today.

24:35.111 --> 24:36.813
My schedule listed
it was Herrera's turn...

24:36.882 --> 24:39.519
shift... whatever it is
Frankel has you two doing.

24:39.588 --> 24:41.155
Herrera had to take
a personal day today, sir.

24:41.225 --> 24:42.358
It's a big call to miss.

24:42.427 --> 24:43.660
All right, don't let me keep you.

24:43.729 --> 24:45.129
Guys, I want status reports.

24:45.198 --> 24:47.535
- The line's all set up inside.
- How's the Big One coming?

24:47.604 --> 24:48.604
I'm in position!

24:48.672 --> 24:49.606
Set!

24:49.674 --> 24:51.008
Here it comes!

24:55.353 --> 24:56.845
Hey! We already told
you to sit yourselves

24:56.870 --> 24:57.979
on the other side of this line.

24:58.024 --> 24:59.626
- No! We can't! We can't!
- You don't understand!

24:59.694 --> 25:01.296
Hey, hey, non-rescue personnel

25:01.365 --> 25:03.300
- can't be over here right now.
- Well, what about her?

25:09.213 --> 25:12.752
Please! Somebody help us! Please!

25:15.748 --> 25:17.349
It's okay, sweetie! It's okay!

25:17.418 --> 25:19.654
Bishop, see if you can
knock down the flames

25:19.722 --> 25:21.073
around the victims.

25:21.098 --> 25:22.498
- Buy some time.
- On it.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.269
Stairs are lost. The airbags won't fit.

25:24.337 --> 25:25.638
We need to get that ladder
in there right now.

25:25.706 --> 25:27.575
Help! Please!

25:31.418 --> 25:34.183
I got you. Mommy's got you, okay?

25:35.532 --> 25:38.302
They're gonna help us! Please help us!

25:39.773 --> 25:41.408
The truck's blocked in.
We got to get everybody to move.

25:41.477 --> 25:43.050
There's no time. The ladder will have

25:43.075 --> 25:44.475
- to reach from here.
- It's blocked!

25:44.501 --> 25:46.136
We can't put the riggers down
on the other side.

25:46.205 --> 25:48.207
The ladder will be way too unsteady,
and you know it's unsafe.

25:48.276 --> 25:49.876
I don't care. I'm going up.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.563
A week before she died,

25:55.631 --> 25:57.967
Mom picked me up early
from school one day.

25:58.036 --> 26:00.840
I think it was a-a Thursday.

26:00.908 --> 26:03.512
Sh-She didn't even make up
an excuse for my teacher.

26:03.581 --> 26:07.153
She just decided we needed a fun day.

26:07.222 --> 26:09.991
We had ice cream. We went to the park.

26:10.060 --> 26:14.300
And we just sat there,

26:14.369 --> 26:17.540
talking about nothing, really.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.509
She looked at me and told me

26:19.579 --> 26:23.217
she would always
be there for me if she could.

26:23.286 --> 26:27.559
But if something ever happened,
if she ever wasn't...

26:31.770 --> 26:35.208
...that you would be there for me.

26:35.276 --> 26:37.913
And that I had to look after you.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.389
She said, "You take care of him, okay?"

26:42.976 --> 26:44.310
She made me promise.

26:44.379 --> 26:45.580
That's...

26:45.649 --> 26:48.184
I don't... I can't... I...

26:48.253 --> 26:53.896
I promised her...
that I'd look out for you.

26:53.965 --> 26:59.485
She took care of you every way
she could every single day,

26:59.535 --> 27:01.504
and so have I.

27:01.572 --> 27:03.074
Every day since.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.211
So don't shut me out.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.349
Don't you dare not talk to me.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.453
Don't tell me not to look out for you.

27:09.522 --> 27:10.989
Don't you dare do that.

27:11.059 --> 27:12.726
Not when taking care of you

27:12.795 --> 27:15.165
is the one real piece of her I have left.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.782
I had no idea. You never told me.

27:18.783 --> 27:20.450
That's why I have to.

27:20.519 --> 27:25.393
I can't just... I have to
watch out for you, Papi.

27:25.842 --> 27:27.644
I know it's what she would have done.

27:27.713 --> 27:31.351
Andrea.

27:31.419 --> 27:34.223
- I...
- Dad?

27:35.829 --> 27:37.496
Dad? Dad!

27:37.565 --> 27:39.701
Dad? Da... I need help in here!

27:39.770 --> 27:41.739
Dad. Dad.

27:44.112 --> 27:45.564
Slow and steady.

27:48.286 --> 27:50.355
All right, go, go, go!

27:55.267 --> 27:56.668
It's okay, sweetie.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.689
Why are they going so slow?!

28:03.758 --> 28:05.226
Ladder only goes one speed!

28:05.294 --> 28:07.330
Station's asking if we can
release a patrol car.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.402
What are you do... What is he doing?

28:10.471 --> 28:12.240
He's got the face...

28:12.308 --> 28:14.879
the one he gets when he's got
a really stupid idea.

28:23.418 --> 28:24.786
Tanner, what the hell are you doing?!

28:24.855 --> 28:26.857
- Drop your baby to me.
- Are you crazy?!

28:26.925 --> 28:29.027
There isn't time.
I will catch him. I promise.

28:29.096 --> 28:30.731
No! Go, go, go!

28:33.104 --> 28:35.273
Oh, my God.

28:36.477 --> 28:39.148
Trust me, please!

28:39.648 --> 28:41.349
- Just let go!
- No, I can't! I can't!

28:41.418 --> 28:42.953
I can't just let go! I can't!

28:43.021 --> 28:45.725
The building's about to go!

28:45.794 --> 28:46.827
I know!

28:46.896 --> 28:48.831
You see that firefighter on the ladder?

28:48.900 --> 28:50.353
When he gets here, you're gonna have to

28:50.387 --> 28:52.155
climb over the rail and jump to him.

28:52.224 --> 28:54.125
You can't do that
if you're holding your baby!

28:54.195 --> 28:55.595
You will miss! You will fall!

28:55.664 --> 28:57.799
Your baby will fall with you!

28:57.868 --> 28:58.768
Aah!

29:00.640 --> 29:02.375
- What's your name?
- Allison!

29:02.444 --> 29:03.511
And your baby?

29:03.580 --> 29:05.181
Jacob!

29:05.250 --> 29:07.170
Jacob. This is Jacob.

29:07.224 --> 29:09.092
Allison, the only way to save Jacob,

29:09.161 --> 29:10.328
the only way to save both of you,

29:10.397 --> 29:11.898
is for you to listen to my friend Ryan.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.727
- Now you can do this.
- I can't!

29:13.752 --> 29:14.752
Yes, you can.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.656
He was fine. He was just talking.

29:16.725 --> 29:18.393
But now he's unresponsive, and...

29:18.462 --> 29:20.731
He's hypotensive. I need one of epi.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.364
What's happening?
I think he may be having

29:22.432 --> 29:24.472
an allergic reaction to the cisplatin.

29:26.511 --> 29:28.580
I need another epi. Steroids. Now.

29:28.649 --> 29:29.982
Is he gonna be all right?

29:30.051 --> 29:31.319
Uh, no, I'm sorry,

29:31.388 --> 29:33.857
but I really need you
to get out of here. Nurse?

29:33.926 --> 29:35.159
All right, pushing another epi.

29:35.228 --> 29:37.163
And let's hang some fluid.

29:37.232 --> 29:38.333
Come on.

29:42.225 --> 29:43.192
Aah!

29:43.217 --> 29:45.821
Let go! Please! It'll be okay!

29:49.353 --> 29:54.443
Mommy loves you. I will always love you.

30:33.133 --> 30:34.334
Hey, there.

30:37.010 --> 30:38.602
It's time. You got to jump. Ready?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.014
- I can't!
- Yes, you can.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.486
Yes, you can. Okay.

30:41.513 --> 30:43.515
All right, you got this. Yes, you can!

30:43.584 --> 30:45.185
Okay.

30:45.254 --> 30:46.789
It's time. You got to jump!

30:52.937 --> 30:53.904
Aah!

30:59.617 --> 31:01.886
I got you! Hey!

31:01.955 --> 31:04.291
Miller, go!

31:13.246 --> 31:14.915
Jacob!

31:14.983 --> 31:16.551
Yeah, it's okay.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.459
Your dad experienced
an allergic reaction.

31:30.528 --> 31:32.496
His regimen is tough,

31:32.565 --> 31:35.402
and his body is going to fight it.

31:35.471 --> 31:38.038
But now that we know
this could happen every time...

31:38.063 --> 31:39.330
Every time?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.100
You want him to
keep going with this treatment

31:41.169 --> 31:43.137
when it sent him into medical distress?

31:43.206 --> 31:46.143
I still believe it is his best option.

31:46.212 --> 31:49.851
That said, I'll understand
if you two decide

31:49.920 --> 31:53.057
that you do not want to
continue with the treatment.

31:53.126 --> 31:54.661
We keep going.

31:57.736 --> 32:02.081
Dad, if it's hurting you
this much after one treatment,

32:02.106 --> 32:04.975
I mean, there has to be other options.

32:05.044 --> 32:07.079
I mean, think of the toll
it's gonna take.

32:07.149 --> 32:09.619
What kind of toll do you think
the cancer will take?

32:11.190 --> 32:14.624
I would... would like to
keep going with the treatment.

32:16.668 --> 32:20.187
I would like to include my daughter

32:20.230 --> 32:21.464
in all future information

32:21.532 --> 32:23.434
about my chemo schedule and appointments.

32:23.503 --> 32:25.305
I, uh... I would like to

32:25.374 --> 32:28.211
make her part of this process, please.

32:42.107 --> 32:43.904
Hey, Tanner.

32:45.724 --> 32:46.824
Helluva save today.

32:46.893 --> 32:48.260
Helluva save yourself.

33:12.815 --> 33:13.882
Hey, you okay?

33:16.088 --> 33:17.155
Yeah.

33:18.761 --> 33:20.596
Hey, can you, uh...

33:22.568 --> 33:24.370
Can you just stand next to me?

33:25.292 --> 33:28.532
This, um... This helps.

33:31.061 --> 33:32.963
I think this is what I need right now.

34:05.496 --> 34:06.930
I told you I didn't want...

34:06.998 --> 34:08.321
Take the soup.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.578
I'm sure the things I think you need

34:15.647 --> 34:18.149
are very different than
the ones you think you need.

34:18.217 --> 34:21.456
So, I brought some of each.

34:21.525 --> 34:24.495
And I am here if and when you want more.

34:47.190 --> 34:48.424
If you don't want to go,

34:48.492 --> 34:50.027
then just tell tell her
you don't want to go.

34:50.096 --> 34:52.512
Hi... Oh, hi, Grant!

34:52.549 --> 34:53.815
Sorry, I didn't know if there was, like,

34:53.884 --> 34:55.418
a doorbell or something.

34:57.859 --> 34:59.227
Uh, sorry, yeah. Yeah, I'm just...

34:59.296 --> 35:00.362
I got a, um, thing.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.166
Is it weird that I just showed up?

35:02.723 --> 35:04.892
I thought we had plans,
but then you didn't reach out,

35:04.961 --> 35:07.431
so I thought maybe
I was supposed to meet you here.

35:07.499 --> 35:09.735
I can't do breakfast.

35:09.804 --> 35:11.071
Oh.

35:11.139 --> 35:12.307
You seem really great.

35:12.376 --> 35:13.977
But, uh...

35:14.045 --> 35:15.680
I don't date.

35:15.749 --> 35:17.517
Are you some kind of
fire-fighting monk, or...?

35:17.586 --> 35:21.211
No, no, definitely not a monk.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.881
I watched an entire building
burn to the ground last night.

35:23.950 --> 35:26.586
I'm in the middle of stuff
like that all the time.

35:26.654 --> 35:28.556
I know what it's like being with someone

35:28.625 --> 35:30.795
who could die
in the line of duty any day.

35:30.864 --> 35:32.364
It's not fair.

35:32.433 --> 35:34.435
I never want to
put someone else through that.

35:34.503 --> 35:38.142
Okay, I thought I was just here
for breakfast.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.590
And not only have you married us off,

35:41.658 --> 35:43.393
but I'm widowed now, too?

35:43.461 --> 35:44.963
You move fast.

35:45.031 --> 35:47.504
It's easier this way. I promise.

35:48.538 --> 35:49.538
I don't date.

35:49.608 --> 35:51.883
It's not what I do.

35:53.582 --> 35:56.352
Then let me paint you a picture
of what we could do.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.590
First, I... Well,
I'll take you to breakfast,

35:58.659 --> 35:59.926
like we planned.

35:59.995 --> 36:01.529
Not today. Today's already weird.

36:01.598 --> 36:03.700
But soon.

36:03.769 --> 36:07.073
Something simple, delicious.
I know a place.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.117
And then that night, I'll call.

36:09.186 --> 36:10.820
See how your day went.

36:10.889 --> 36:11.855
I'm a pretty straightforward guy.

36:11.924 --> 36:13.158
I don't play games.

36:13.227 --> 36:15.763
It's just a thing
you should know about me.

36:15.832 --> 36:16.932
Then, a few days after that,

36:17.001 --> 36:18.135
I'll see if you want to grab dinner.

36:18.204 --> 36:20.573
Nothing too fancy, but nice.

36:20.642 --> 36:22.744
I'll want to dress up a little for you.

36:23.358 --> 36:26.329
I'm hoping by then,
you might want to kiss me.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.834
I know I'll want to kiss you.

36:27.903 --> 36:29.045
I already do.

36:30.977 --> 36:34.214
But I'll save that for our third date.

36:34.283 --> 36:37.287
We'll go to Kerry Park.
We'll talk all night.

36:37.746 --> 36:39.547
And I'm guessing that's all
just in the next few weeks,

36:39.616 --> 36:42.988
so we're a ways off
from me being widowed.

36:43.057 --> 36:44.624
Assuming breakfast goes well.

36:47.632 --> 36:50.069
Let's start with breakfast.

36:53.511 --> 36:54.911
Hi!

36:54.981 --> 36:56.322
Hey.

36:57.612 --> 36:58.745
Oh!

36:58.967 --> 37:00.300
You smell like a chimney.

37:00.369 --> 37:03.073
Did you get another call
after you left the hospital?

37:03.142 --> 37:04.910
Nothing important.

37:04.979 --> 37:06.146
Huh. Yeah.

37:06.214 --> 37:07.983
Okay, Benjamin Warren, we don't do this.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.454
We do not shut each other out.

37:10.524 --> 37:12.091
I agree...?

37:12.160 --> 37:15.164
Pruitt told me you have had
some big calls recently.

37:15.232 --> 37:17.141
- Ohh.
- You fell through a roof?

37:17.210 --> 37:20.107
- Almost.
- You were almost electrocuted?

37:20.697 --> 37:22.164
Trying to save a patient?

37:23.669 --> 37:24.769
Come on.

37:24.838 --> 37:28.944
I told you I wanted you to share with me.

37:29.013 --> 37:33.648
I wanted to hear about the fire,
the danger, all of it.

37:33.673 --> 37:35.509
We were right here in this bed,
and I asked you

37:35.577 --> 37:39.283
if there was anything going on,
and you said nothing.

37:39.352 --> 37:42.255
And now you sit here on this bed
and I'm checking in again,

37:42.324 --> 37:44.058
and again, it's nothing?

37:44.127 --> 37:45.495
I'm not asking just to ask.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.750
I'm asking so that you tell me.

37:48.808 --> 37:53.014
So you don't have to
hold on to this stuff alone.

37:53.083 --> 37:54.784
Honey, you get to come home

37:54.853 --> 38:00.095
and unload anything you need to
unload so it can be unloaded.

38:00.163 --> 38:02.967
When I check in, I need you
to tell me the truth.

38:03.036 --> 38:06.810
That's how this works.
That's how we work.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.907
Last night, a strip mall burned down.

38:12.976 --> 38:15.212
Like, all the way to the ground.

38:15.281 --> 38:17.650
But I didn't get there for the big stuff.

38:17.719 --> 38:19.654
No, no, no, no. I was...

38:19.723 --> 38:21.892
I showed up well-rested, ready to go,

38:21.961 --> 38:23.896
and got put in charge of overhaul.

38:23.965 --> 38:25.198
It's a fancy word for cleanup.

38:25.268 --> 38:26.735
You know, it's... it's scut.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.706
So, I was there all night

38:28.774 --> 38:32.614
ankle deep in, uh, burnt,
mucky remains of a nail salon,

38:32.682 --> 38:36.849
a restaurant, a dry cleaners,
and a notary's office.

38:36.877 --> 38:39.881
See? It's... It's scut.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.553
Nothing important.

38:42.355 --> 38:45.292
But, uh, you're right.

38:45.361 --> 38:47.731
T-There has been some stuff that
I haven't told you about...

38:47.799 --> 38:50.341
...and some of it gets to me.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.240
Uh, and I didn't want to
burden you with it.

38:53.309 --> 38:56.780
- Mm.
- But I-I will.

38:56.849 --> 38:58.250
I promise I will.

39:03.029 --> 39:05.273
That's better. Thank you.

39:09.989 --> 39:12.893
Just to warn you,
once it starts, it won't stop.

39:12.962 --> 39:14.029
Once the floodgates open,

39:14.097 --> 39:15.587
it's gonna be hours and hours of...

39:20.057 --> 39:21.190
It's all about balance.

39:31.379 --> 39:34.116
Why don't you get home
before you turn into a zombie?

39:34.185 --> 39:35.586
I don't want to leave him here alone.

39:35.655 --> 39:37.389
Why do you think I'm here?

39:37.459 --> 39:40.413
Me and that chair are about to
spend some quality time together.

39:41.582 --> 39:43.384
Come on. Get while the going's good.

39:44.488 --> 39:46.055
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.843
It's about recognizing when

40:03.911 --> 40:05.780
you're able to put a fire out...

40:09.323 --> 40:12.008
...and when you have to
stand back and let it burn.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.739
I have mentioned
I hate running before, right?

40:14.808 --> 40:16.509
Like, a lot?

40:16.578 --> 40:17.979
Well, it's this or the torches.

40:18.047 --> 40:20.851
Why? Why? Why are those
my only two options?

40:20.920 --> 40:22.287
What?

40:25.228 --> 40:26.630
Oh, thank God, a break.

40:29.503 --> 40:31.205
That's pretty.

40:31.274 --> 40:32.909
I don't remember it. Is it new?

40:32.977 --> 40:34.178
Yeah, it is.

40:38.521 --> 40:41.160
So, uh, there's no possibility

40:41.185 --> 40:42.619
of walking the rest
of the way back, is there?

40:42.688 --> 40:44.390
'Cause I'm not above bribery.

40:45.994 --> 40:48.230
Dream on. We got
seven more miles to crush.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.367
Great.

40:52.435 --> 40:53.335
Great.

40:53.404 --> 40:55.172
Slow down!

40:55.240 --> 40:58.176
When a structure's not safe,
when the fire's too hot...

41:01.420 --> 41:03.087
...we're told to stay away.

41:08.674 --> 41:09.975
You won't believe the night I just had.

41:10.043 --> 41:11.745
Or you will because you have
these nights all the time,

41:11.814 --> 41:12.947
but I don't.

41:13.016 --> 41:14.251
Uh, I heard about the fire.

41:14.319 --> 41:16.020
There was a woman trapped on a balcony,

41:16.089 --> 41:17.957
and she had a baby,
and she had to throw her baby,

41:18.026 --> 41:19.045
and I caught him.

41:19.114 --> 41:20.630
- Me. I caught the baby.
- You?

41:20.698 --> 41:22.400
- Caught a baby?
- Yes! It was amazing.

41:22.469 --> 41:26.708
It was... I've never felt
anything like it.

41:26.777 --> 41:28.379
And then we just had to...

41:28.447 --> 41:30.316
stand back and watch
the building burn down.

41:30.385 --> 41:32.253
But what if we can't stay back?

41:32.322 --> 41:34.524
What if there's something
drawing us toward that fire?

41:34.593 --> 41:37.029
Looks like you got pretty close.

41:37.097 --> 41:38.229
Andy.

41:40.705 --> 41:42.172
I can't stand back anymore.

41:42.242 --> 41:44.569
What if it grabs hold of us?

41:45.915 --> 41:48.319
What if it pulls us in?

41:48.387 --> 41:50.523
What if we get too close?

41:50.592 --> 41:53.729
Close enough that fire could burn us?

41:53.798 --> 41:54.764
Your dad?

41:54.833 --> 41:55.933
Isn't home.

42:04.620 --> 42:05.887
And what if...

42:08.694 --> 42:10.636
...we like it?
