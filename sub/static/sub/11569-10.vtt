WEBVTT

00:02.624 --> 00:05.191
Oh, what do we have here?

00:05.580 --> 00:06.913
Huh?

00:07.018 --> 00:09.128
Doesn't look like any
coin I've seen before.

00:10.298 --> 00:12.065
Whoa! Steve. Hey!

00:12.067 --> 00:13.800
Give that back!

00:13.802 --> 00:16.102
Hey, it's mine!

00:17.272 --> 00:18.238
Huh?

00:21.977 --> 00:23.276
Aah!

00:23.278 --> 00:24.213
Ohh.

00:24.279 --> 00:26.379
Morning, grandpa.

00:26.381 --> 00:28.014
Oh, morning, Tommy.

00:28.016 --> 00:30.683
Mr. Pickles!

Good boy!

S02E10
Finale

00:51.706 --> 00:53.806
- Breakfast is ready.
- Finally.

00:53.808 --> 00:55.041
Hey, what's this?

00:55.043 --> 00:56.709
- Well, I'm...
- Hey, Mom!

00:56.711 --> 00:57.977
What's this?

00:57.979 --> 00:59.946
- Well, uh...
- I found this coin outside.

00:59.948 --> 01:02.415
I wonder if it has
something to do with Mr...

01:02.417 --> 01:04.217
Hey, what's this? Hey.

01:04.218 --> 01:05.485
- I'm...
- Hey, a ball!

01:06.955 --> 01:08.421
Tommy, be careful, please.

01:08.423 --> 01:11.124
Hey, Agnes' old sweater?

01:11.126 --> 01:13.326
I'm cleaning out the
attic and throwing awa...

01:13.328 --> 01:14.527
Ow! Tommy!

01:14.529 --> 01:16.396
Why are you throwing this away?

01:16.398 --> 01:17.931
Tommy, take it outside.

01:17.933 --> 01:19.098
Come on, Mr. Pickles.

01:19.100 --> 01:20.767
Now, Dad, what did you want?

01:20.769 --> 01:23.736
Uh, nothing. I know when to shut up.

01:23.738 --> 01:25.238
I'm hungry, more food.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.606
Please.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.441
Huh. Maybe this place can tell me

01:28.443 --> 01:30.043
something about the coin.

01:32.814 --> 01:36.950
Oh, I've never seen anything like it.

01:36.952 --> 01:40.553
Ooh. You might have
something special here.

01:40.555 --> 01:43.423
Let me check something in the back.

01:43.425 --> 01:45.325
Okay.

01:45.327 --> 01:46.326
Hmm.

01:46.328 --> 01:48.061
- Excuse me?
- Oh!

01:48.063 --> 01:50.296
There's something you
should know about that coin.

01:50.298 --> 01:52.131
It, uh...

01:52.133 --> 01:53.599
What is it?

01:53.601 --> 01:54.934
We can't do this here.

01:54.936 --> 01:56.803
- Huh?
- We don't have much time.

01:56.805 --> 01:58.071
You have to come with me.

01:58.073 --> 02:00.073
- But, uh...
- Hurry, hurry.

02:00.075 --> 02:02.508
Yes, that symbol on the coin

02:02.510 --> 02:05.078
has been found on artifacts

02:05.080 --> 02:07.880
that predate the earliest
known civiliza...

02:07.882 --> 02:09.482
Hello?

02:09.484 --> 02:13.553
How much will you give me
for these ancient scrolls?

02:13.555 --> 02:15.588
Slow down! What's going on?

02:15.590 --> 02:17.423
They could be following us.

02:17.425 --> 02:20.460
- What, who?
- I need to know if I can trust you.

02:20.462 --> 02:21.394
Huh?

02:21.396 --> 02:22.762
Can I trust you?

02:22.764 --> 02:24.597
Yes! Just tell me...

02:24.599 --> 02:26.499
Your life is in great jeopardy.

02:26.501 --> 02:28.234
Because of this coin?

02:28.236 --> 02:29.235
That coin, it's...

02:29.237 --> 02:31.437
- Uh, we can't talk here.
- What?

02:31.439 --> 02:34.091
This car could be tapped
with microphones.

02:34.157 --> 02:34.671
Wha...

02:34.737 --> 02:36.609
What? Your car...

02:36.611 --> 02:38.177
Come on. I know where we can talk.

02:38.179 --> 02:40.213
What the hell?

02:40.215 --> 02:42.382
Okay, nobody can hear us in here.

02:42.384 --> 02:43.649
Tell me about the coin.

02:43.651 --> 02:45.151
That coin...

02:45.153 --> 02:46.185
That's him!

02:46.187 --> 02:48.621
They're on to us, come on!

02:48.623 --> 02:49.655
Get him!

02:49.657 --> 02:50.957
He went this way.

02:50.959 --> 02:53.359
Come on, I know a safe place.

02:53.361 --> 02:55.028
- Wha...
- Hurry. Hurry.

02:55.030 --> 02:56.796
- This way! Come on.
- What are we...

02:57.432 --> 03:01.701
Now,
what's the truth about this coin?

03:01.703 --> 03:04.270
The truth is...

03:05.140 --> 03:07.507
I don't know anything about it.

03:07.764 --> 03:08.437
What?

03:08.516 --> 03:10.843
I don't even work at that antique store.

03:10.845 --> 03:13.346
I just go there to pick up old men.

03:13.348 --> 03:15.181
Huh?

03:15.183 --> 03:16.983
I know, I'm bad.

03:16.985 --> 03:18.918
But what about the guys after us?

03:18.920 --> 03:21.020
- Those are my friends.
- Uh, and your car?

03:21.022 --> 03:23.289
Stole it. What a rush, huh?

03:23.291 --> 03:25.825
I really do love old things.

03:25.827 --> 03:27.927
Uh... What do you say I blow some dust

03:27.929 --> 03:30.530
off that old antique of yours, huh?

03:30.532 --> 03:32.131
What?

03:32.934 --> 03:34.333
Oh! Whoa.

03:34.335 --> 03:36.469
Isn't this fun, Mr. Pickles?

03:36.471 --> 03:37.970
Whoa.

03:37.972 --> 03:40.239
Huh? Where'd the ball go?

03:40.241 --> 03:43.142
Ball! Ball!

03:43.144 --> 03:46.179
Oh, Mr. Ball!

04:27.722 --> 04:28.554
Huh?

04:30.125 --> 04:31.591
I-I don't know what you're saying.

04:31.593 --> 04:33.926
Get the ball. Go get the ball.
Get the ball.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.394
I'm not going in there.

04:46.007 --> 04:47.940
Uh, help me get...

04:47.942 --> 04:49.142
I can't do this.

04:49.144 --> 04:51.577
You're far too young for me.

04:51.579 --> 04:52.879
That makes it hotter.

04:52.881 --> 04:54.981
Hey, get out of there. I got to go.

04:54.983 --> 04:57.283
Nice to meet... hey.

04:57.285 --> 04:58.084
Let me out.

04:58.086 --> 04:59.952
You're not going anywhere

04:59.954 --> 05:02.755
until you learn to love me,
you little bitch.

05:02.757 --> 05:05.892
Wait,
I'm still in love with my wife.

05:05.894 --> 05:08.361
You're married?

05:08.563 --> 05:10.429
- Even better!
- Huh?

05:10.431 --> 05:12.565
I love threesomes with old couples.

05:12.567 --> 05:15.268
- What?
- Three makes the train go choo-choo!

05:15.270 --> 05:17.136
Look,
I just want to know about the coin.

05:17.138 --> 05:19.472
And I just want to have a threesome

05:19.474 --> 05:21.641
with an elderly couple,
so call your wife.

05:21.643 --> 05:23.209
No, you don't understand.

05:23.211 --> 05:26.979
My wife Agnes passed away years ago.

05:26.981 --> 05:28.748
You're just lying so
you can get out of this.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.651
- No.
- Liar, liar, pants on...

05:31.653 --> 05:33.653
the floor. Wait, hey, no!

05:33.655 --> 05:35.354
Agnes is dead. Prove it,

05:35.356 --> 05:38.524
or I'll never leave you alone... liar.

05:39.894 --> 05:41.627
Honk-honk. Hey.

05:44.899 --> 05:46.432
Aah! Honey, what's for lunch?

05:46.434 --> 05:49.135
Just let me clean a little more up here

05:49.137 --> 05:50.770
- and I'll make you...
- Okay, hurry up.

05:51.906 --> 05:53.573
- Ma'! I lost the ball.
- Ohh!

05:53.575 --> 05:56.576
- Do you have another one?
- Tommy, I'm very busy.

05:56.578 --> 05:58.377
Okay, what's this?

05:58.379 --> 05:59.845
Oh, my first camera.

05:59.847 --> 06:02.515
I used to take so many photographs.

06:02.597 --> 06:03.283
Oh, what's this?

06:03.322 --> 06:05.585
Oh, careful, please.
My old stethoscope.

06:05.587 --> 06:07.386
- I wanted to be a doc...
- And what's this, Mommy?

06:07.388 --> 06:10.189
Oh, Tommy,
don't touch my old fencing saber.

06:10.191 --> 06:12.692
So why'd you stop using all this stuff,
Mom?

06:12.694 --> 06:15.328
You grow up, things change.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.697
Your mother tells you that photography

06:17.699 --> 06:20.233
is painting for lazy people,

06:20.235 --> 06:22.435
no girl could ever be a doctor.

06:22.437 --> 06:25.504
And the only blade
work a woman should do

06:25.506 --> 06:26.739
is in the kitchen!

06:26.741 --> 06:28.007
Ha, you're wrong, Mom.

06:28.009 --> 06:29.942
People love clowns!

06:31.879 --> 06:33.246
Okay, bye, Mom.

06:33.248 --> 06:34.914
How about you get cooking, honey?

06:34.916 --> 06:37.083
Me want food in me tum-tum.

06:40.788 --> 06:42.755
What kind of music is this?

06:42.757 --> 06:44.390
Oh, it's recorded-sounds

06:44.392 --> 06:46.659
of-me-having-sex-with-old-men
and-their-wives music.

06:46.661 --> 06:48.194
Oh, we're here.

06:51.599 --> 06:53.532
See? I wasn't lying.

06:53.534 --> 06:54.900
Here's her grave.

06:54.902 --> 06:56.435
Agnes Gobbleblobber?

06:56.437 --> 06:58.738
How am I to know that
you didn't just bring me

06:58.740 --> 06:59.872
to some random grave?

06:59.874 --> 07:02.975
Beloved wife of Henry Gobbleblobber.

07:02.977 --> 07:04.543
That's my name.

07:04.545 --> 07:06.912
I thought your name was grandpa, liar.

07:06.914 --> 07:08.581
People just call me that, geez.

07:08.583 --> 07:12.018
Oh, it broke my heart when Agnes died.

07:12.020 --> 07:14.687
Aw, I'm sorry.

07:14.689 --> 07:16.088
Anyway, take care.

07:16.090 --> 07:18.724
Maybe the antique store is still opened.

07:18.726 --> 07:19.925
Wait.

07:19.927 --> 07:23.229
It doesn't get older than dead...

07:23.231 --> 07:25.631
Let's have a
threesome with your dead wife.

07:25.633 --> 07:27.266
What?! That's sick.

07:27.268 --> 07:30.002
Let's find out what
your dead wife thinks.

07:30.004 --> 07:32.672
- What?
- Start digging.

07:32.674 --> 07:34.807
Oh, come on.

07:34.809 --> 07:36.175
Ball!

07:36.177 --> 07:38.444
Here ball, ball, ball. Come here, ball!

07:38.446 --> 07:41.681
Oh,
it was right here the whole time.

07:41.683 --> 07:43.749
Ew, what's that?

07:45.853 --> 07:48.454
You got the ketchup off!
Good boy.

07:48.456 --> 07:51.557
Food. Food. Food. Food.
Food. Hungry. Food.

07:51.559 --> 07:54.126
- Dinner's ready.
- Me. Hungry. Want. Food.

07:54.128 --> 07:55.928
Hey, Mom, I found my ball! Look!

07:55.930 --> 07:57.196
Chicken for dinner?

07:57.198 --> 07:59.098
Aw, honey, how about steak and potatoes?

07:59.100 --> 08:01.000
- Hey, Mom, I found my ball.
- I'm starving.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.835
I'm really not in the mood for chicken.

08:02.837 --> 08:04.337
Mom. Mom. Mom!

08:04.339 --> 08:05.971
Look, I found my ball!

08:05.973 --> 08:06.872
Hyah!

08:08.609 --> 08:10.776
Honey, have you gone mad?

08:10.778 --> 08:12.511
We had chicken on Tuesday.

08:12.513 --> 08:14.113
You want dinner?

08:14.115 --> 08:16.315
- Cook it your own damn self!
- Huh?

08:16.317 --> 08:19.418
Things are gonna start changing
around here from now on.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.753
Huh?

08:22.190 --> 08:24.590
Why are you making me do this?

08:24.592 --> 08:26.225
Keep digging.

08:26.227 --> 08:28.561
I'm getting hotter just
thinking about a three-way

08:28.563 --> 08:30.730
with you and your dead wife.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.066
There's the old girl.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.067
Now, open it.

08:35.068 --> 08:36.335
- No, please!
- Move it,

08:36.337 --> 08:37.535
or I'll kill you and have sex

08:37.538 --> 08:38.871
with both of your dead bodies.

08:38.873 --> 08:40.039
You're crazy, you know that.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.174
Fine.

08:43.811 --> 08:45.144
Huh?

08:45.146 --> 08:46.946
Styrofoam peanuts?

08:46.948 --> 08:48.581
Oh! Oh! Where is she?

08:48.583 --> 08:49.715
She's not in here!

08:49.717 --> 08:51.550
You're lying! Move.

08:52.387 --> 08:53.953
Huh?

08:55.757 --> 08:56.856
Huh?

08:56.858 --> 08:58.157
The graves!

08:58.159 --> 09:00.192
They're all dug out from the bottom!

09:00.194 --> 09:02.495
What is this place? I'm scared.

09:02.497 --> 09:06.298
Mr. Pickles must have done
something with Agnes's body.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.234
- Who's Mr. Pickles?
- Shut up.

09:08.236 --> 09:09.602
Don't leave me here.

09:11.706 --> 09:13.606
What the hell?

09:13.608 --> 09:15.908
An underground city?

09:15.910 --> 09:19.345
It's the same symbol on the coin.

09:19.347 --> 09:24.917
I'm coming for you, Mr. Pickles.

10:21.509 --> 10:23.442
Mr. Pickles!

10:23.444 --> 10:24.777
Huh?

10:24.779 --> 10:26.378
Where is Agnes's body?

10:26.380 --> 10:29.048
I demand you tell me right now.

10:29.050 --> 10:30.916
So assertive... hot.

10:30.918 --> 10:32.685
- Back off, bitch.
- Whatever.

10:32.687 --> 10:35.221
There's some older guys over there.

10:35.223 --> 10:36.689
Who wants a piece of thi...

10:38.459 --> 10:40.659
Tell me where her body is, right now.

10:40.661 --> 10:42.027
Or you're dead.

10:42.029 --> 10:44.129
You too, Steve.

10:44.131 --> 10:45.598
Where's Agnes!

10:48.503 --> 10:50.703
Hello, Henry.

10:50.705 --> 10:53.572
Agnes? You're alive?

10:53.574 --> 10:54.656
How?

10:55.052 --> 10:59.078
It all started when I met Mr...
