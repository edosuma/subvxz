00:10.080 --> 00:11.320
<i>- I can confirm</i>

00:11.400 --> 00:12.480
<i>there has been an</i>
<i>explosion today</i>

00:12.560 --> 00:13.920
<i>at a business premises here</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:16.160
<i>on O'Connell Street, a nail bar.</i>

00:16.240 --> 00:17.480
<i>I'm very sorry to confirm that</i>

00:17.560 --> 00:19.640
<i>two people have</i>
<i>lost their lives.</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:21.320
<i>Foreca rightly wanting to know</i>

00:21.400 --> 00:22.720
<i>if there's a connection</i>

00:22.800 --> 00:24.680
<i>with the explosion in</i>
<i>Newport few days ago,</i>

00:24.760 --> 00:25.680
<i>and I understand,</i>

00:25.760 --> 00:28.000
<i>but it's far too early to say,</i>

00:28.080 --> 00:30.320
<i>and it would serve no</i>
<i>purpose for me to speculate.</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:31.160
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:50.040
<i>The next witness for the</i>
<i>crime is Emma Hedges.</i>

02:10.560 --> 02:12.480
<i>Those two lying</i>
<i>dead on the floor,</i>

02:12.560 --> 02:14.520
<i>and they're stuck</i>
<i>all over with glasses</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:16.840
<i>horrendous, they're young,</i>

02:16.920 --> 02:19.080
<i>wearing worked Unix,</i>
<i>there's a shrine in there.</i>

02:23.160 --> 02:25.640
<i>Tell me the exact words</i>
<i>the witnesses used.</i>

02:25.720 --> 02:29.040
<i>Pink flash, purple</i>
<i>flush, or purple flame,</i>

02:29.120 --> 02:30.560
<i>and the window blueing.</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:32.440
<i>- That's great.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

02:32.520 --> 02:35.000
<i>Only potassium burns</i>
<i>with allylic flame.</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:36.520
<i>Does that tell us</i>
<i>what kind of bomb?</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:39.240
<i>It tells us which materials</i>
<i>may have been used,</i>

02:39.320 --> 02:40.160
<i>and that's a start.</i>

02:42.000 --> 02:44.560
<i>So Daniel introduced you</i>
<i>to his father, Phil MacAfee</i>

02:44.640 --> 02:46.480
<i>when you all went for</i>
<i>this Indian meal together?</i>

02:46.560 --> 02:47.880
<i>Yes.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:49.240
<i>And you saw Mr. Phil</i>
<i>MacAfee the next day</i>

02:49.320 --> 02:51.160
<i>when he came to Daniel's flat?</i>

02:51.240 --> 02:52.560
<i>Yes.</i>

02:52.640 --> 02:53.440
<i>When did you next</i>
<i>see Phil MacAfee?</i>

02:55.880 --> 02:57.080
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

02:57.160 --> 02:57.920
<i>'Cause,</i>

02:59.680 --> 03:02.600
<i>you had a conversation</i>
<i>with Mr. Phil MacAfee</i>

03:02.680 --> 03:05.760
<i>at the body of Coffee</i>
<i>House, Parker Street,</i>

03:05.840 --> 03:07.680
<i>1:45,</i>

03:07.760 --> 03:09.440
<i>25th of September.</i>

03:09.520 --> 03:10.640
<i>Is that right?</i>

03:11.920 --> 03:12.960
<i>I'm not sure if</i>
<i>that's the exact date,</i>

03:13.040 --> 03:14.360
<i>but yes, I did.</i>

03:14.440 --> 03:15.840
<i>Mr. Phil MacAfee reports</i>
<i>the date and time,</i>

03:15.920 --> 03:17.720
<i>and the ladies and</i>
<i>gentlemen of the jury</i>

03:17.800 --> 03:18.960
<i>have heard from members of staff</i>

03:19.040 --> 03:21.000
<i>of the body of Coffee House,</i>

03:21.080 --> 03:23.720
<i>so they will be</i>
<i>comfortable with the time.</i>

03:23.800 --> 03:25.120
<i>Okay.</i>

03:25.200 --> 03:26.680
<i>So, did you arrange</i>
<i>to meet Mr. MacAfee?</i>

03:28.280 --> 03:29.720
<i>No.</i>

03:29.800 --> 03:31.160
<i>How did you find him there?</i>

03:33.360 --> 03:34.800
<i>I saw him through the window.</i>

03:36.280 --> 03:38.000
<i>So, you didn't follow him?</i>

03:42.520 --> 03:43.280
<i>No.</i>

03:46.120 --> 03:47.880
<i>You didn't know that</i>
<i>it was the coffee</i>

03:47.960 --> 03:50.960
<i>that Mr. MacAfee</i>
<i>routinely goes to?</i>

03:51.040 --> 03:52.280
<i>No.</i>

03:52.360 --> 03:54.040
<i>No, you just happened</i>
<i>to be passing by?</i>

03:54.120 --> 03:54.880
<i>Yes.</i>

03:55.920 --> 03:59.400
<i>So 150,000 people in Dundee,</i>

03:59.480 --> 04:02.080
<i>and you just spotted him?</i>

04:03.320 --> 04:04.120
<i>Yes.</i>

04:07.480 --> 04:09.640
<i>You didn't expect this, did you?</i>

04:09.720 --> 04:11.200
<i>You didn't think I'd</i>
<i>be asking you about</i>

04:11.280 --> 04:12.920
<i>some innocuous meeting</i>
<i>in a coffee shop</i>

04:13.000 --> 04:14.560
<i>and you're lying</i>
<i>about the tangent.</i>

04:14.640 --> 04:17.240
<i>So, why should the jury</i>
<i>believe you about anything</i>

04:17.320 --> 04:18.280
<i>if you're lying about this?</i>

04:18.360 --> 04:20.200
<i>- I'm not lying.</i>
<i>- Daniel,</i>

04:21.440 --> 04:23.120
<i>No, Daniel might know</i>

04:23.200 --> 04:25.360
<i>which coffee was his</i>
<i>father's favourite.</i>

04:25.440 --> 04:27.680
<i>Did you maybe hear about</i>
<i>the coffee from Daniel?</i>

04:28.800 --> 04:29.920
<i>- Was he in on it?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

04:32.040 --> 04:35.920
<i>So, how did this conversation</i>

04:36.000 --> 04:37.880
<i>go between you and</i>
<i>Mr. Phil MacAfee?</i>

04:40.760 --> 04:42.400
<i>I asked him if</i>
<i>he'd killed my mom.</i>

04:44.320 --> 04:45.600
<i>Why did you ask him that?</i>

04:47.000 --> 04:48.240
<i>Because I thought he had,</i>

04:48.320 --> 04:49.640
<i>and I wanted to</i>
<i>see his reaction.</i>

04:51.600 --> 04:52.680
<i>What was his reaction?</i>

04:53.800 --> 04:54.920
<i>He said I wasn't well,</i>

04:56.280 --> 04:57.680
<i>he tried to make</i>
<i>me look unreliable</i>

04:57.760 --> 04:59.840
<i>in front of the</i>
<i>other people there.</i>

04:59.920 --> 05:01.720
<i>He did what you're</i>
<i>trying to do actually.</i>

05:03.760 --> 05:05.640
<i>And did you tell</i>
<i>Daniel afterwards</i>

05:05.720 --> 05:08.520
<i>that you'd spotted</i>
<i>his father in a coffee</i>

05:08.600 --> 05:11.360
<i>and gone in to ask him</i>
<i>if he'd killed your mum?</i>

05:11.440 --> 05:12.680
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

05:12.760 --> 05:14.760
<i>What did Daniel think</i>
<i>of your behaviour?</i>

05:14.840 --> 05:17.400
<i>He was surprised by it,</i>
<i>but I think he got it.</i>

05:17.480 --> 05:18.840
<i>When you explained it to him?</i>

05:18.920 --> 05:20.160
<i>Yes.</i>

05:20.240 --> 05:22.840
<i>You seem to be a very</i>
<i>persuasive person</i>

05:22.920 --> 05:24.120
<i>with Daniel's consent.</i>

05:26.520 --> 05:29.680
<i>So you're moved away</i>
<i>from Dundee as a child</i>

05:29.760 --> 05:31.600
<i>to be shielded from</i>
<i>the news coverage</i>

05:31.680 --> 05:33.480
<i>of your mother's murder.</i>

05:33.560 --> 05:36.080
<i>A year ago, at the age of 23,</i>

05:36.160 --> 05:38.720
<i>you applied for the job</i>
<i>in Dundee and returned.</i>

05:40.240 --> 05:41.000
<i>Why?</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:44.800
<i>- It was a really good job.</i>
<i>- Did you come back to Dundee</i>

05:44.880 --> 05:46.680
<i>determined to get the identity</i>
<i>of your mother's murderer?</i>

05:46.760 --> 05:48.080
<i>No.</i>

05:48.160 --> 05:51.160
<i>Did you want to find out</i>
<i>who killed your mother?</i>

05:51.240 --> 05:53.000
<i>Anybody in my position would do.</i>

05:53.080 --> 05:55.640
<i>- So you did really wanted to?</i>
<i>- Oh yes, obviously.</i>

05:55.720 --> 05:57.520
<i>Thank you, message is...</i>

06:10.240 --> 06:11.840
<i>An explosion is a</i>
<i>chemical reaction</i>

06:11.920 --> 06:14.160
<i>producing a rapid</i>
<i>expansion of gas.</i>

06:14.240 --> 06:16.400
<i>If the explosive's</i>
<i>unconfined, it can disagree,</i>

06:16.480 --> 06:20.040
<i>the expanding gas pushes</i>
<i>out in all directions.</i>

06:20.120 --> 06:21.440
<i>If it's confined,</i>

06:21.520 --> 06:23.040
<i>the explosion can</i>
<i>become detonating,</i>

06:23.120 --> 06:25.640
<i>which has a much greater</i>
<i>effect on the surroundings.</i>

06:25.720 --> 06:27.960
<i>So, see this debris field,</i>

06:28.040 --> 06:29.360
<i>the glass was projected</i>

06:29.440 --> 06:31.160
<i>much further that</i>
<i>side than shop side</i>

06:31.240 --> 06:32.800
<i>because this side</i>

06:32.880 --> 06:34.280
<i>whatever exploded wasn't</i>
<i>impeded by the shop wall.</i>

06:34.360 --> 06:35.920
<i>So I'm thinking the epicentre</i>

06:36.000 --> 06:37.800
<i>was the side of</i>
<i>the window maybe.</i>

06:37.880 --> 06:40.480
<i>Would you be able to</i>
<i>find whatever exploded?</i>

06:40.560 --> 06:41.800
<i>If exploded completely,</i>

06:41.880 --> 06:43.120
<i>that whole device</i>
<i>may be consumed.</i>

06:43.200 --> 06:46.240
<i>It depends how efficient</i>
<i>the device was.</i>

06:46.320 --> 06:47.920
<i>It looks pretty efficient to me.</i>

06:50.120 --> 06:52.680
<i>Sarah, I've got everybody</i>
<i>on my back wanting to know</i>

06:52.760 --> 06:54.920
<i>if this is the work of the</i>
<i>same bomber or bombers.</i>

06:55.000 --> 06:56.520
<i>All I can tell you is,</i>

06:56.600 --> 06:58.080
<i>the kind of device</i>
<i>we're talking about here</i>

06:58.160 --> 07:00.520
<i>seems to have nothing in</i>
<i>common with the first device.</i>

07:03.720 --> 07:07.520
<i>Bone in a living person</i>
<i>is wet and bendy,</i>

07:07.600 --> 07:11.000
<i>bone in a dead person</i>
<i>is dry and brittle.</i>

07:11.080 --> 07:12.920
<i>Imagine trying to</i>
<i>break a green twig</i>

07:13.000 --> 07:15.440
<i>as opposed to a dried stick.</i>

07:15.520 --> 07:17.920
<i>So you can tell whether</i>
<i>a bone has been broken</i>

07:18.000 --> 07:20.440
<i>- perimortem more post-mortem?</i>
<i>- Yes</i>

07:20.520 --> 07:21.680
<i>You told us that the break</i>

07:21.760 --> 07:23.640
<i>in Marie Monroe's hyoid bone</i>

07:23.720 --> 07:25.640
<i>is consistent with</i>
<i>strangulation?</i>

07:25.720 --> 07:27.000
<i>Yes.</i>

07:27.080 --> 07:28.720
<i>Is it consistent</i>
<i>with a break made</i>

07:28.800 --> 07:30.320
<i>to the bone of a living person?</i>

07:30.400 --> 07:31.880
<i>Yes.</i>

07:31.960 --> 07:33.360
<i>Thank you, Professor Torrance.</i>

07:36.640 --> 07:38.520
<i>What's the definition</i>
<i>of perimortem again?</i>

07:38.600 --> 07:40.240
<i>At and around the time of death.</i>

07:40.320 --> 07:41.560
<i>Okay.</i>

07:41.640 --> 07:44.040
<i>Is the bone of a person</i>
<i>who has just died</i>

07:44.120 --> 07:46.880
<i>very different from</i>
<i>the bone of a person,</i>

07:46.960 --> 07:49.360
<i>that same bone just</i>
<i>before they've died.</i>

07:49.440 --> 07:50.360
<i>No.</i>

07:50.440 --> 07:51.920
<i>Are they exactly the same?</i>

07:52.000 --> 07:54.360
<i>For a short period of time, yes.</i>

07:54.440 --> 07:56.840
<i>Could Marie Monroe's hyoid bone</i>

07:56.920 --> 07:58.880
<i>have been broken by a fall?</i>

07:58.960 --> 08:01.600
<i>No, to fracture one of the</i>
<i>horns of the hyoid bone</i>

08:01.680 --> 08:03.240
<i>needs a specific</i>
<i>kind of pressure.</i>

08:03.320 --> 08:04.560
<i>And could have been broken</i>

08:04.640 --> 08:06.240
<i>by soil pressure</i>
<i>in the dump site.</i>

08:06.320 --> 08:07.720
<i>No, that wouldn't break a bone.</i>

08:07.800 --> 08:09.840
<i>Could a in the soil break it?</i>

08:09.920 --> 08:11.080
<i>No.</i>

08:11.160 --> 08:13.320
<i>Could somebody treading</i>
<i>on a hyoid bone</i>

08:13.400 --> 08:15.840
<i>- through the soil break it.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

08:15.920 --> 08:17.280
<i>But it could have</i>
<i>been done with a rope?</i>

08:19.160 --> 08:21.320
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Aha.</i>

08:27.280 --> 08:28.920
<i>There's no certainty</i>

08:29.000 --> 08:33.520
<i>about Maria Monroe's</i>
<i>cause of death, its like.</i>

08:34.920 --> 08:36.880
<i>The hyoid bone looks fragile,</i>

08:36.960 --> 08:38.880
<i>but it's strong</i>
<i>in the sense that</i>

08:38.960 --> 08:40.280
<i>it's only possible to break it</i>

08:40.360 --> 08:42.000
<i>- using from inward squeezing.</i>

08:42.080 --> 08:44.840
<i>Fresh break to Marie</i>
<i>Monroe's hyoid bone,</i>

08:44.920 --> 08:46.840
<i>conforms with pressure</i>
<i>placed on the bone</i>

08:46.920 --> 08:49.560
<i>by something such</i>
<i>as hands or similar,</i>

08:49.640 --> 08:52.080
<i>putting inward</i>
<i>pressure on the bone.</i>

08:57.520 --> 09:00.000
<i>One male victim, Tuan Van Khan,</i>

09:00.080 --> 09:02.520
<i>female victim Chung T. Kim.</i>

09:02.600 --> 09:05.760
<i>They are Vietnamese</i>
<i>both in the 20s,</i>

09:05.840 --> 09:07.480
<i>staff and nail technicians.</i>

09:08.560 --> 09:09.920
<i>- Got it boss.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

09:10.000 --> 09:10.800
<i>Thank you, Safi.</i>

09:12.040 --> 09:13.400
<i>Neil,</i>

09:13.480 --> 09:14.720
<i>Yeah, go on.</i>

09:14.800 --> 09:16.640
<i>One formulation of</i>
<i>this kind of devices,</i>

09:16.720 --> 09:18.800
<i>you take a glass jar or bottle</i>

09:18.880 --> 09:20.120
<i>and you partly fill it</i>

09:20.200 --> 09:22.000
<i>with a mixture of</i>
<i>acid and petrol.</i>

09:22.080 --> 09:23.320
<i>You take a condom,</i>

09:23.400 --> 09:25.360
<i>you fill it with</i>
<i>sugar and chlorine.</i>

09:25.440 --> 09:27.320
<i>You fix the condom to the</i>
<i>underside of the screw top</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:29.320
<i>so it's hanging just</i>
<i>above the liquid.</i>

09:29.400 --> 09:30.880
<i>When you leave the</i>
<i>jar on its side,</i>

09:30.960 --> 09:32.720
<i>the acid comes into</i>
<i>contact with the condom,</i>

09:32.800 --> 09:35.160
<i>it breaks it down, you</i>
<i>get chemical reaction,</i>

09:35.240 --> 09:38.440
<i>potassium, chloride, and</i>
<i>sugar ignites allylic flame,</i>

09:38.520 --> 09:41.360
<i>which ignites the petrol</i>
<i>creating hot gases.</i>

09:41.440 --> 09:43.600
<i>The gases expand,</i>
<i>the jar explodes.</i>

09:44.640 --> 09:45.840
<i>The window glass is flat,</i>

09:45.920 --> 09:48.520
<i>this piece, thinner and curved.</i>

09:48.600 --> 09:51.240
<i>- From a jar or a bottle.</i>
<i>- Possibly.</i>

09:51.320 --> 09:52.520
<i>How long does it</i>
<i>take for the acid</i>

09:52.600 --> 09:54.960
<i>to break down the condom?</i>

09:55.040 --> 09:58.200
<i>I dunno, it depends,</i>
<i>a few minutes.</i>

09:58.280 --> 09:59.400
<i>I'd have to do a mock-up</i>

09:59.480 --> 10:01.160
<i>for the same</i>
<i>performance to know.</i>

10:02.840 --> 10:04.680
<i>I mean, you could lay a</i>
<i>device on a sideway there</i>

10:04.760 --> 10:05.880
<i>as you walk past.</i>

10:05.960 --> 10:07.240
<i>Good.</i>

10:07.320 --> 10:08.200
<i>And you wouldn't</i>
<i>wanna be carrying</i>

10:08.280 --> 10:09.480
<i>that device around for long</i>

10:09.560 --> 10:10.600
<i>after you've fixed</i>
<i>in the condom,</i>

10:10.680 --> 10:12.400
<i>even if it kept operating.</i>

10:12.480 --> 10:13.800
<i>So you're saying,</i>

10:13.880 --> 10:15.440
<i>our bomber was maybe not</i>
<i>just planting the bomb,</i>

10:15.520 --> 10:17.280
<i>but rigging it up minutes before</i>

10:17.360 --> 10:19.200
<i>somewhere close to</i>
<i>where we are now?</i>

10:25.160 --> 10:26.080
<i>What's going on?</i>

10:26.160 --> 10:27.960
<i>Our shop in town was blown up.</i>

10:28.040 --> 10:29.240
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

10:29.320 --> 10:31.200
<i>Yeah, Sarah is</i>
<i>there now, how'd go?</i>

10:31.280 --> 10:32.680
<i>Quite nice.</i>

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
<i>- Did you feel in control?</i>
<i>- more or less?</i>

10:33.840 --> 10:35.360
<i>Oh, there you go.</i>

10:35.440 --> 10:36.960
<i>I felt in really safe hands</i>
<i>when you were up there.</i>

10:37.040 --> 10:39.280
<i>Well, if I can get the</i>
<i>science across, I'm happy.</i>

10:39.360 --> 10:40.760
<i>I gotta go, good luck with...</i>

10:57.600 --> 10:58.520
<i>We're looking into the bomb</i>

10:58.600 --> 10:59.680
<i>that went off in the church hall</i>

10:59.760 --> 11:01.800
<i>in Newport three days ago,</i>

11:01.880 --> 11:03.120
<i>Gaynor Rogers told us</i>

11:03.200 --> 11:04.920
<i>that when the two of you</i>
<i>were living together,</i>

11:05.000 --> 11:08.200
<i>you'd drop her off for a lot</i>
<i>his class at the church hall,</i>

11:08.280 --> 11:09.840
<i>you knew the time and the place.</i>

11:09.920 --> 11:11.520
<i>Right.</i>

11:11.600 --> 11:13.960
<i>You told Gaynor Rogers you'd</i>
<i>kill her if she left you.</i>

11:14.040 --> 11:14.920
<i>I never would've said that.</i>

11:15.000 --> 11:16.480
<i>She recorded you on her phone</i>

11:16.560 --> 11:17.840
<i>and we found the recording.</i>

11:17.920 --> 11:19.960
<i>Okay, maybe I said it,</i>
<i>but I never meant it,</i>

11:20.040 --> 11:21.320
<i>it's just words.</i>

11:21.400 --> 11:23.400
<i>I say all sorts in the</i>
<i>moment to mark my point,</i>

11:23.480 --> 11:26.320
<i>it's normal, it's just</i>
<i>words .</i>

11:26.400 --> 11:28.200
<i>Gaynor's family support</i>
<i>Gaynor's account</i>

11:28.280 --> 11:29.840
<i>that you were physically</i>
<i>violent towards her.</i>

11:29.920 --> 11:31.280
<i>And again, that game</i>
<i>is good as you go-</i>

11:31.360 --> 11:32.840
<i>I've met Gaynor,</i>

11:33.920 --> 11:35.640
<i>I'd describe her as petite.</i>

11:35.720 --> 11:36.560
<i>Sure about that?</i>

11:37.720 --> 11:39.200
<i>I'd also describe her as alive,</i>

11:40.880 --> 11:42.120
<i>alive and well,</i>
<i>walking in a boot,</i>

11:42.200 --> 11:43.960
<i>and I'll say, it's</i>
<i>three feet just fine,</i>

11:44.040 --> 11:46.440
<i>where she'd find difficult</i>
<i>to do if I had killed her.</i>

11:50.080 --> 11:51.560
<i>And she did leave me by the way.</i>

11:53.520 --> 11:54.840
<i>Where were you last Sunday?</i>

11:57.680 --> 11:59.960
<i>Ryan Fairlie was in</i>
<i>his house till 11:00,</i>

12:00.040 --> 12:01.680
<i>he went to the news</i>
<i>agents to get some rules,</i>

12:01.760 --> 12:03.360
<i>had his breakfast,</i>

12:03.440 --> 12:05.360
<i>to the half 12:00 train to</i>
<i>see his mom and Stonehaven</i>

12:05.440 --> 12:06.800
<i>got there at Tuesday,</i>
<i>stayed there til 8:00.</i>

12:06.880 --> 12:08.160
<i>Well, the doors</i>
<i>to the church hall</i>

12:08.240 --> 12:09.520
<i>don't open til 12:00</i>

12:09.600 --> 12:11.160
<i>so he'd have heard</i>
<i>they've been going,</i>

12:11.240 --> 12:11.960
<i>so he may have put a bomb</i>
<i>there and get the train.</i>

12:12.040 --> 12:12.960
<i>If he got the train,</i>

12:13.040 --> 12:14.160
<i>He showed me his ticket.</i>

12:14.240 --> 12:15.280
<i>I could show you a ticket.</i>

12:15.360 --> 12:17.600
<i>Safi, come on, check it all,</i>

12:17.680 --> 12:20.680
<i>shop, station, CCTV</i>
<i>on both trains.</i>

12:20.760 --> 12:23.520
<i>I don't like Ryan Fairlie boss.</i>
<i>And he may be in the frame</i>

12:23.600 --> 12:24.880
<i>for the church hall bomb,</i>

12:24.960 --> 12:26.520
<i>he has alibied for</i>
<i>the nail bar bomb.</i>

12:26.600 --> 12:27.880
<i>He was sitting in reception.</i>

12:31.120 --> 12:32.680
<i>God knows what</i>
<i>this is all about.</i>

12:35.360 --> 12:37.600
<i>Essays, please forgive me</i>

12:37.680 --> 12:39.600
<i>if I've been slow to mark,</i>

12:39.680 --> 12:40.960
<i>but we're all caught up now.</i>

12:42.760 --> 12:45.560
<i>Oh, something I've</i>
<i>been meaning to say,</i>

12:45.640 --> 12:46.760
<i>all of you are looking</i>

12:46.840 --> 12:49.120
<i>to work in the forensic arena,</i>

12:50.640 --> 12:52.720
<i>you'll be under scrutiny.</i>

12:52.800 --> 12:55.800
<i>Lawyers will be trawling</i>
<i>through your social media.</i>

12:57.360 --> 12:59.160
<i>You need to conduct yourselves</i>
<i>professionally online,</i>

12:59.240 --> 13:00.440
<i>and you need to start now.</i>

13:01.760 --> 13:03.600
<i>Hey, if any of</i>
<i>you wanna find out</i>

13:03.680 --> 13:05.000
<i>about the fascinating study,</i>

13:05.080 --> 13:06.440
<i>me and Erica are working on,</i>

13:06.520 --> 13:09.480
<i>on decomposition in</i>
<i>water using dead pigs</i>

13:09.560 --> 13:11.840
<i>acquired according to the</i>
<i>university's ethical code,</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:13.800
<i>we're doing a</i>
<i>presentation tomorrow.</i>

13:13.880 --> 13:14.680
<i>Oh, welcome.</i>

13:18.800 --> 13:19.960
<i>No one seems to have a clue</i>

13:20.040 --> 13:21.280
<i>what these bombs are about.</i>

13:23.160 --> 13:25.960
<i>Yeah, there was a tonne of</i>
<i>security at the court house.</i>

13:26.040 --> 13:26.800
<i>How did it go?</i>

13:28.520 --> 13:30.080
<i>Phil MacAfee's being represented</i>

13:30.160 --> 13:32.960
<i>by Keith Farr and</i>
<i>he's horribly good.</i>

13:33.040 --> 13:36.160
<i>Emma said she did okay,</i>
<i>but she looks shaky.</i>

13:36.240 --> 13:38.560
<i>Well, the enormity</i>
<i>of it for her.</i>

13:38.640 --> 13:40.600
<i>Hi Mrs. ,</i>
<i>sorry to interrupt.</i>

13:40.680 --> 13:42.280
<i>I just wanted to say, oh my God,</i>

13:42.360 --> 13:46.240
<i>you handled that so well,</i>
<i>the face is perfect.</i>

13:59.720 --> 14:01.920
<i>Have you seen what</i>
<i>they're saying about us?</i>

14:02.000 --> 14:03.040
<i>They hate us.</i>

14:04.280 --> 14:06.000
<i>'Cause I don't look.</i>

14:08.600 --> 14:09.800
<i>Why didn't you eat with us?</i>

14:10.880 --> 14:11.720
<i>I wasn't hungry.</i>

14:12.880 --> 14:15.520
<i>You're pregnant,</i>
<i>you need to eat.</i>

14:15.600 --> 14:16.520
<i>I had a cereal bar.</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:21.120
<i>You lied in court.</i>

14:24.080 --> 14:24.840
<i>I had to.</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:30.760
<i>You lost it there saying things</i>
<i>I didn't want you to say,</i>

14:30.840 --> 14:33.680
<i>but I knew I had to say</i>
<i>'cause they were true.</i>

14:33.760 --> 14:36.120
<i>How come you think one rule</i>
<i>applies to you not to me?</i>

14:37.600 --> 14:39.000
<i>You know, if I'd have said,</i>

14:39.080 --> 14:40.360
<i>I did go to his office</i>

14:40.440 --> 14:41.680
<i>and I did wait around</i>

14:41.760 --> 14:43.440
<i>and I did follow</i>
<i>him to that cafe,</i>

14:43.520 --> 14:45.480
<i>I'd have sounded</i>
<i>like a mad woman.</i>

14:45.560 --> 14:47.520
<i>It's just a distraction,</i>
<i>it's all a dirty game,</i>

14:47.600 --> 14:48.840
<i>and I wasn't gonna play it.</i>

14:48.920 --> 14:51.560
<i>Emma, you lied in court,</i>

14:51.640 --> 14:53.080
<i>you're totally on the wrong.</i>

14:53.160 --> 14:54.320
<i>I stand by what I did.</i>

14:54.400 --> 14:56.320
<i>Well, no one</i>
<i>believed you anyway.</i>

14:56.400 --> 14:57.640
<i>You looked like a liar</i>

14:57.720 --> 14:59.160
<i>and you made me</i>
<i>look like a liar,</i>

14:59.240 --> 15:01.160
<i>like, encourage you to</i>
<i>stalk him to a coffee.</i>

15:01.240 --> 15:02.520
<i>But I didn't intend to.</i>

15:02.600 --> 15:04.920
<i>well you did, that</i>
<i>is what you did.</i>

15:06.640 --> 15:08.440
<i>And I don't know what you</i>
<i>are trying to achieve,</i>

15:08.520 --> 15:11.440
<i>but the way you came</i>
<i>across was so hot,</i>

15:12.560 --> 15:13.760
<i>you were like a robot.</i>

15:13.840 --> 15:15.120
<i>Well, it was a total</i>
<i>headache for me,</i>

15:15.200 --> 15:16.440
<i>stood there in</i>
<i>front of your dad.</i>

15:16.520 --> 15:17.480
<i>How was it for you?</i>

15:18.600 --> 15:19.520
<i>I didn't have the pleasure</i>

15:19.600 --> 15:20.880
<i>of analysing your performance,</i>

15:20.960 --> 15:21.720
<i>you sailed through it, did you?</i>

15:21.800 --> 15:23.480
<i>I feel so let down.</i>

15:23.560 --> 15:24.560
<i>- By me?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

15:24.640 --> 15:26.320
<i>You feel let down by me.</i>

15:26.400 --> 15:28.280
<i>I did my bet for</i>
<i>you today, Emma.</i>

15:28.360 --> 15:29.320
<i>I did my bet more.</i>

15:29.400 --> 15:30.320
<i>It's not for me,</i>

15:30.400 --> 15:31.880
<i>it's just doing the right thing.</i>

15:31.960 --> 15:33.440
<i>Which you didn't do</i>
<i>because you lied in court.</i>

15:33.520 --> 15:35.240
<i>Because the only thing</i>
<i>that I care about</i>

15:35.320 --> 15:36.680
<i>is getting justice for my mom.</i>

15:36.760 --> 15:39.560
<i>I know, that's</i>
<i>what's wrong here.</i>

15:39.640 --> 15:40.920
<i>Getting justice for your mom</i>

15:41.000 --> 15:42.720
<i>as it put my dad away</i>
<i>if he didn't do that.</i>

15:49.320 --> 15:51.080
<i>When I walked in the court,</i>

15:51.160 --> 15:53.080
<i>my dad smiled out me</i>
<i>and a smiled back.</i>

15:56.680 --> 15:58.240
<i>I didn't even know I was</i>
<i>doing it until I'd done it.</i>

15:59.840 --> 16:01.200
<i>You know what else I did?</i>

16:01.280 --> 16:02.080
<i>I cried.</i>

16:03.480 --> 16:04.680
<i>It offends though,</i>
<i>I was as painless,</i>

16:04.760 --> 16:06.240
<i>wish I totally</i>
<i>under the influence</i>

16:06.320 --> 16:07.880
<i>of this, hardest</i>
<i>news Emma Hedges.</i>

16:07.960 --> 16:09.480
<i>And then you come in,</i>

16:09.560 --> 16:11.400
<i>you've resolved this news</i>
<i>and prove them right?</i>

16:11.480 --> 16:12.520
<i>But no one sailed through,</i>

16:12.600 --> 16:14.320
<i>Emma, we both looked terrible,</i>

16:14.400 --> 16:15.720
<i>but at least I told the truth.</i>

16:15.800 --> 16:18.080
<i>You glad we look terrible.</i>

16:18.160 --> 16:20.040
<i>Your dad's more likely to</i>
<i>get off if we're discredited</i>

16:20.120 --> 16:21.880
<i>and you want him to</i>
<i>get off, don't you?</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:26.600
<i>What made you cry?</i>

16:29.240 --> 16:30.040
<i>All of it.</i>

16:32.040 --> 16:34.440
<i>Four months ago, you</i>
<i>were fine with it.</i>

16:34.520 --> 16:36.080
<i>Well, not fine but</i>
<i>you got to the point</i>

16:36.160 --> 16:37.800
<i>where you had a bad</i>
<i>enough opinion of your dad</i>

16:37.880 --> 16:41.280
<i>based on facts to think he</i>
<i>might have been involved.</i>

16:41.360 --> 16:43.200
<i>And even though that was</i>
<i>terrible for you to think,</i>

16:43.280 --> 16:44.520
<i>you were big enough</i>

16:44.600 --> 16:46.120
<i>to take the information</i>
<i>you had to the police.</i>

16:46.200 --> 16:47.440
<i>But the moment they charged him,</i>

16:47.520 --> 16:49.400
<i>you slowly started</i>
<i>to lose your nerve.</i>

16:49.480 --> 16:50.760
<i>Went down a rabbit hole,</i>

16:50.840 --> 16:52.880
<i>looking for stuff about</i>
<i>miscarriages of justice.</i>

16:52.960 --> 16:54.360
<i>And then you started</i>
<i>holding back from me</i>

16:54.440 --> 16:55.440
<i>because you blame me.</i>

16:55.520 --> 16:57.480
<i>Did you see him?</i>

16:57.560 --> 16:59.200
<i>- Did you see if he's stable?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

16:59.280 --> 17:00.920
<i>That's my dad.</i>

17:01.000 --> 17:02.320
<i>A terrible thing happened to you</i>

17:02.400 --> 17:03.720
<i>a really long time ago,</i>

17:03.800 --> 17:04.960
<i>but terrible thing's</i>
<i>happening to me now</i>

17:05.040 --> 17:06.560
<i>and you refuse to see it,</i>

17:06.640 --> 17:08.040
<i>you're just obsessed with</i>
<i>getting what you want.</i>

17:08.120 --> 17:08.880
<i>What do you want?</i>

17:08.960 --> 17:11.000
<i>I want not to be here.</i>

17:11.080 --> 17:12.320
<i>I don't want any of</i>
<i>this to be happening.</i>

17:12.400 --> 17:14.000
<i>- Well, it is.</i>
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>

17:15.080 --> 17:16.320
<i>And I don't blame you,</i>

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
<i>I blame myself for</i>
<i>going to the funeral</i>

17:17.480 --> 17:18.920
<i>and starting up with you again.</i>

17:19.000 --> 17:20.240
<i>I should've left that</i>
<i>day like I planned</i>

17:20.320 --> 17:21.760
<i>and we could have come</i>
<i>at this trial clean.</i>

17:21.840 --> 17:22.760
<i>How?</i>

17:22.840 --> 17:24.080
<i>'Cause we wouldn't be stuck</i>

17:24.160 --> 17:26.040
<i>and my mom's for a</i>
<i>fact sick, pregnant.</i>

17:26.120 --> 17:27.240
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

18:55.080 --> 18:57.600
<i>- What's up?</i>
<i>- Nothing.</i>

18:57.680 --> 18:59.680
<i>- Why's the wash on?</i>
<i>- Can't sleep.</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:01.360
<i>Me neither.</i>

19:02.960 --> 19:04.240
<i>The one I looked at Twitter,</i>

19:04.320 --> 19:05.880
<i>people are saying</i>
<i>you broke down.</i>

19:07.520 --> 19:11.040
<i>Emma was steely, the thing</i>
<i>she accosted your dad-</i>

19:11.120 --> 19:15.920
<i>I don't want to hear</i>
<i>about it, all right?</i>

19:32.280 --> 19:33.480
<i>It's not anyone's fault.</i>

19:35.560 --> 19:37.680
<i>It's not caused by anything</i>
<i>you do or don't do.</i>

19:39.400 --> 19:41.800
<i>Note, six weeks is the</i>
<i>highest risk of it happening.</i>

19:46.080 --> 19:48.880
<i>- I just feel so sad.</i>

19:48.960 --> 19:49.760
<i>Me too.</i>

19:52.520 --> 19:53.960
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

19:58.800 --> 20:00.040
<i>We were not stuck together,</i>

20:00.120 --> 20:01.920
<i>we never taken a</i>
<i>situation anymore.</i>

20:03.240 --> 20:04.760
<i>Let's just get</i>
<i>through it tomorrow.</i>

20:07.320 --> 20:08.560
<i>Yeah, after that,</i>

20:10.200 --> 20:11.600
<i>neither of us has to be here.</i>

20:14.360 --> 20:15.160
<i>No.</i>

20:27.000 --> 20:31.360
<i>I'm so thrilled with this</i>
<i>lovely pretty condom,</i>

20:31.440 --> 20:33.440
<i>perfectly preserved</i>
<i>because it's trapped</i>

20:33.520 --> 20:35.000
<i>between the metal and the glass.</i>

20:36.560 --> 20:38.160
<i>What's so good about a condom?</i>

20:38.240 --> 20:40.920
<i>Different brands use</i>
<i>different lubricants.</i>

20:41.000 --> 20:42.400
<i>So, what would you do?</i>

20:46.160 --> 20:49.960
<i>We use a solvent to extract</i>
<i>a sample of the lubricant,</i>

20:50.040 --> 20:52.480
<i>run the sample through the FTIR,</i>

20:52.560 --> 20:54.440
<i>compare the data with-</i>

20:54.520 --> 20:56.360
<i>Data on the condom</i>
<i>lubricant database.</i>

21:04.440 --> 21:05.960
<i>It's made by Flomax,</i>

21:06.040 --> 21:08.280
<i>used in just one line</i>
<i>of the range, the clone.</i>

21:09.320 --> 21:10.600
<i>Good work.</i>

21:10.680 --> 21:12.120
<i>It's a tiny piece</i>
<i>of information,</i>

21:12.200 --> 21:13.920
<i>but tiny pieces in aggregate</i>

21:14.000 --> 21:15.480
<i>tells a lot about</i>
<i>the bomb maker.</i>

21:18.480 --> 21:20.680
<i>We're still not sure who the</i>
<i>first bomb was meant for.</i>

21:22.080 --> 21:24.200
<i>We don't even know if</i>
<i>the second is connected.</i>

21:26.000 --> 21:26.880
<i>We don't know what</i>
<i>we're looking at,</i>

21:26.960 --> 21:28.720
<i>never mind the why.</i>

21:28.800 --> 21:30.760
<i>Professor key to privacy, right?</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:32.040
<i>Oh, drop it.</i>

21:33.320 --> 21:35.320
<i>Neil, I made a joke</i>

21:35.400 --> 21:37.200
<i>trying to lighten up the mood.</i>

21:39.120 --> 21:40.400
<i>Good luck today.</i>

21:42.040 --> 21:46.960
<i>Good time.</i>

21:48.680 --> 21:49.800
<i>There's a black pill there.</i>

21:49.880 --> 21:51.280
<i>Firm with the debris</i>

21:51.360 --> 21:53.800
<i>directly in front of</i>
<i>the nail bar window.</i>

21:53.880 --> 21:55.000
<i>Honey, I can't say black pill</i>

21:55.080 --> 21:57.360
<i>without thinking black pill.</i>

21:57.440 --> 21:58.640
<i>Huh?</i>

21:58.720 --> 22:00.160
<i>Black pill, you know?</i>

22:01.440 --> 22:03.000
<i>No.</i>

22:03.080 --> 22:04.840
<i>Right, so, you</i>
<i>know in the matrix,</i>

22:04.920 --> 22:06.200
<i>there's the red pill</i>
<i>and the blue pill</i>

22:06.280 --> 22:07.320
<i>and you have to choose.</i>

22:07.400 --> 22:08.520
<i>Vaguely.</i>

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
<i>- So-</i>

22:09.680 --> 22:11.200
<i>- Morning.</i>
<i>- Morning.</i>

22:11.280 --> 22:13.280
<i>- Emma, you have to go.</i>
<i>- Shit.</i>

22:15.400 --> 22:17.800
<i>All right, so, the</i>
<i>blue pill's like,</i>

22:17.880 --> 22:19.120
<i>you live in innocence</i>

22:19.200 --> 22:20.560
<i>that the matrix</i>
<i>exists, whatever.</i>

22:20.640 --> 22:22.400
<i>And then the red pill's like,</i>

22:22.480 --> 22:23.680
<i>you know what's really going on,</i>

22:23.760 --> 22:25.560
<i>but you can do</i>
<i>something about it.</i>

22:25.640 --> 22:28.000
<i>And then the black pill's</i>
<i>just like, pointless.</i>

22:28.080 --> 22:29.280
<i>And that's not in</i>
<i>the film by the way,</i>

22:29.360 --> 22:30.440
<i>that's just what some</i>
<i>people have said.</i>

22:30.520 --> 22:31.920
<i>Emma, you have to go,</i>

22:33.320 --> 22:34.520
<i>we're all waiting for you.</i>

22:36.840 --> 22:37.640
<i>Thanks.</i>

22:43.320 --> 22:45.480
<i>Can't believe she</i>
<i>came into work today.</i>

22:45.560 --> 22:46.520
<i>God, that's what I would do,</i>

22:46.600 --> 22:47.520
<i>throw myself into work</i>

22:47.600 --> 22:49.360
<i>til my mind's off things.</i>

22:49.440 --> 22:51.160
<i>She looks quite a</i>
<i>pro in this thing.</i>

22:56.440 --> 22:58.640
<i>This black pill</i>
<i>isn't total black,</i>

22:58.720 --> 22:59.920
<i>it's got pale marks on it.</i>

23:18.200 --> 23:20.720
<i>Nothing so far from the</i>
<i>CCTV on O'Connor Street.</i>

23:20.800 --> 23:23.080
<i>How, in the middle of the day?</i>

23:23.160 --> 23:24.400
<i>There's a rat run,</i>

23:24.480 --> 23:25.720
<i>you can sneak up</i>
<i>to O'Connor Street</i>

23:25.800 --> 23:27.000
<i>and back off again,</i>

23:27.080 --> 23:28.720
<i>using realities and side</i>
<i>streets all the way.</i>

23:28.800 --> 23:30.920
<i>It's amazed but, if he</i>
<i>knew what you were doing,</i>

23:31.000 --> 23:31.920
<i>you could do it.</i>

23:32.000 --> 23:33.400
<i>Well, chase the CCTV.</i>

23:34.800 --> 23:36.000
<i>And what's the story</i>
<i>about Ryan Fairlie?</i>

23:36.080 --> 23:37.760
<i>His mother says he was with her.</i>

23:37.840 --> 23:39.760
<i>Still nothing from</i>
<i>the CCTV on the train.</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:42.920
<i>- Could you do it on a bike?</i>

23:43.000 --> 23:44.560
<i>No way, it's 50 miles.</i>

23:44.640 --> 23:47.000
<i>No, the rat run,</i>
<i>could you do it on a bike?</i>

23:49.680 --> 23:51.480
<i>Why aren't you</i>
<i>with Daniel today?</i>

23:53.840 --> 23:54.760
<i>- Emma,</i>
<i>- Emma,</i>

23:55.640 --> 23:56.560
<i>please, Emma.</i>

23:56.640 --> 23:58.000
<i>Can you tell us anything.</i>

24:10.040 --> 24:12.080
<i>See if you can find</i>
<i>this from the database.</i>

24:18.400 --> 24:20.480
<i>Good morning, Detective</i>
<i>Chief Inspector McKinven.</i>

24:20.560 --> 24:21.840
<i>Good morning.</i>

24:21.920 --> 24:23.120
<i>Now, we've just</i>
<i>heard you give us</i>

24:23.200 --> 24:24.400
<i>a very thorough</i>
<i>account of your work</i>

24:24.480 --> 24:26.880
<i>on the Marie Monroe</i>
<i>murder case, court case.</i>

24:26.960 --> 24:28.280
<i>Yes.</i>

24:28.360 --> 24:30.320
<i>Were you surprised to be</i>
<i>entrusted with the case?</i>

24:30.400 --> 24:32.000
<i>You were a common garden</i>
<i>detective inspector at the time,</i>

24:32.080 --> 24:33.320
<i>boots on the ground?</i>

24:35.240 --> 24:36.800
<i>I was gratified to be</i>
<i>entrusted with the case,</i>

24:36.880 --> 24:39.040
<i>and determined to do my best.</i>

24:39.120 --> 24:41.720
<i>How many court cases</i>
<i>have you worked on?</i>

24:41.800 --> 24:42.600
<i>Just this one.</i>

24:43.760 --> 24:45.600
<i>Thank you, DCI McKinven.</i>

25:01.560 --> 25:03.720
<i>It's an antidepressant,</i>
<i>poseidon,</i>

25:05.360 --> 25:06.840
<i>brand name's Sarah Paxson.</i>

25:09.520 --> 25:10.400
<i>In case it matches that though,</i>

25:10.480 --> 25:11.960
<i>let's see if the contents do.</i>

25:15.720 --> 25:16.720
<i>Phil MacAfee.</i>

25:48.520 --> 25:50.760
<i>I swear by almighty God,</i>

25:50.840 --> 25:54.240
<i>the evidence I shall</i>
<i>give be the truth,</i>

25:54.320 --> 25:56.560
<i>the whole truth and</i>
<i>nothing but the truth.</i>

26:01.120 --> 26:02.960
<i>This fishing trip,</i>

26:03.040 --> 26:04.960
<i>night fishing with</i>
<i>your brother Alec</i>

26:05.040 --> 26:07.960
<i>■on Sunday, the 12th</i>
<i>of August, 2001,</i>

26:08.040 --> 26:10.640
<i>are you a keen</i>
<i>fisherman, Mr. MacAfee.</i>

26:10.720 --> 26:11.440
<i>Not at all.</i>

26:13.280 --> 26:15.240
<i>Like Alec was saying</i>
<i>when he was up here,</i>

26:15.320 --> 26:16.520
<i>he's the fishermen.</i>

26:17.560 --> 26:19.320
<i>He has all the gear.</i>

26:19.400 --> 26:22.320
<i>When did the memory of this</i>
<i>fishing trip come to light?</i>

26:22.400 --> 26:24.000
<i>I had to think</i>
<i>back to that time,</i>

26:26.120 --> 26:28.320
<i>who I was spending</i>
<i>time with at that time.</i>

26:29.800 --> 26:31.320
<i>And I remember that Alec</i>

26:31.400 --> 26:33.800
<i>gave me a lot of</i>
<i>support and good advice</i>

26:33.880 --> 26:38.520
<i>when my wife was ill and</i>
<i>I was, not in a good way.</i>

26:38.600 --> 26:40.120
<i>You're spending a lot of time</i>

26:40.200 --> 26:43.160
<i>with Izzy Alessi, Drew Cubbin</i>
<i>and Marie Monroe at time.</i>

26:45.000 --> 26:46.480
<i>No.■</i>

26:46.560 --> 26:49.080
<i>Izzy I knew casually,</i>

26:49.160 --> 26:50.280
<i>Drew and Marie were</i>
<i>part of our scene,</i>

26:50.360 --> 26:52.160
<i>probably, he knew them at home.</i>

26:53.720 --> 26:56.080
<i>According to Izzy</i>
<i>Alessi's dying deposition,</i>

26:56.160 --> 26:58.440
<i>it was a scene you were</i>
<i>actively involved in,</i>

26:58.520 --> 27:01.160
<i>and then you had her trapped</i>

27:01.240 --> 27:04.160
<i>in a physically abusive</i>
<i>sexual relationship,</i>

27:04.240 --> 27:06.360
<i>which she felt too</i>
<i>terrified to end.</i>

27:11.480 --> 27:13.440
<i>I'm in a difficult</i>
<i>situation here.</i>

27:13.520 --> 27:14.320
<i>Why is that?</i>

27:17.240 --> 27:20.040
<i>'Cause I don't wish to</i>
<i>speak ill of the dead.</i>

27:20.120 --> 27:21.760
<i>You just need to</i>
<i>speak truthfully.</i>

27:25.600 --> 27:26.760
<i>Izzy was desperate.</i>

27:28.120 --> 27:30.880
<i>Heroin makes you desperate,</i>

27:30.960 --> 27:32.200
<i>it makes you lie.</i>

27:32.280 --> 27:35.320
<i>So why did you have even</i>
<i>a passing acquaintance</i>

27:35.400 --> 27:37.080
<i>with such a desperate character?</i>

27:37.160 --> 27:38.560
<i>That's a very good question.</i>

27:40.840 --> 27:43.880
<i>How was that with my</i>
<i>debts, ailing with cancer,</i>

27:45.280 --> 27:47.160
<i>running the business by myself,</i>

27:48.760 --> 27:51.120
<i>the prospect of bringing</i>
<i>up Daniel alone.</i>

27:52.600 --> 27:53.560
<i>I didn't have the maturity</i>

27:53.640 --> 27:55.160
<i>to deal with the responsibility,</i>

27:55.240 --> 27:57.840
<i>so I went looking</i>
<i>for the opposite.</i>

27:57.920 --> 27:59.200
<i>If I'm in the dark</i>

27:59.280 --> 28:01.760
<i>for being a selfish</i>
<i>pig 19 years ago,</i>

28:01.840 --> 28:02.760
<i>I'm guilty.</i>

28:05.560 --> 28:07.000
<i>This has nothing to do with me.</i>

28:08.520 --> 28:09.680
<i>The murder of Marie Monroe</i>

28:09.760 --> 28:11.040
<i>has nothing to do with you?</i>

28:11.920 --> 28:12.720
<i>No.</i>

28:14.560 --> 28:15.640
<i>What about the boots?</i>

28:16.920 --> 28:18.360
<i>Marie Monroe's</i>
<i>blood on the boots,</i>

28:18.440 --> 28:20.720
<i>your DNA in the boots,</i>

28:20.800 --> 28:23.640
<i>a shoe print at the dump</i>
<i>site matching the boots.</i>

28:23.720 --> 28:25.080
<i>The boots are buried</i>

28:25.160 --> 28:27.760
<i>at a building site</i>
<i>where you'd worked</i>

28:27.840 --> 28:30.920
<i>your skin cells were</i>
<i>inside those boots.</i>

28:32.240 --> 28:33.360
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

28:34.720 --> 28:35.920
<i>If you're a builder,</i>

28:36.000 --> 28:37.840
<i>you don't have</i>
<i>one pair of boots.</i>

28:37.920 --> 28:39.760
<i>You have boots in the house,</i>

28:39.840 --> 28:40.680
<i>boots in the van,</i>

28:40.760 --> 28:42.120
<i>boots in the office</i>

28:42.200 --> 28:43.720
<i>and you get through them.</i>

28:43.800 --> 28:45.680
<i>A few months and those</i>
<i>boots are stinking so bad,</i>

28:45.760 --> 28:47.640
<i>they practically walk</i>
<i>themselves in the door</i>

28:47.720 --> 28:49.160
<i>and into the bin.</i>

28:52.800 --> 28:54.080
<i>Are you suggesting</i>

28:54.160 --> 28:55.960
<i>someone took your</i>
<i>boots out of a bin</i>

28:56.040 --> 29:00.120
<i>and wore them while murdering</i>
<i>Marie Monroe, who you knew?</i>

29:00.200 --> 29:01.440
<i>I have no clue what happened</i>

29:01.520 --> 29:03.240
<i>'cause this had</i>
<i>nothing to do with me.</i>

29:47.000 --> 29:48.280
<i>Whoever pointed that</i>
<i>bomb in the nail bar</i>

29:48.360 --> 29:49.560
<i>just under seven minutes</i>

29:49.640 --> 29:51.640
<i>to get cleared</i>
<i>before it exploded,</i>

29:51.720 --> 29:53.760
<i>Sarah also established the</i>
<i>maker had a condom used.</i>

29:55.160 --> 29:56.520
<i>Sorry, Ryan Fairlie</i>
<i>was on the trains.</i>

29:56.600 --> 29:57.360
<i>He said he was,</i>

29:58.600 --> 30:00.080
<i>he couldn't have</i>
<i>bombed the church hall.</i>

30:00.160 --> 30:02.120
<i>Keep digging, find the why.</i>

30:06.200 --> 30:08.280
<i>See, the target</i>
<i>was father in QC.</i>

30:10.000 --> 30:12.400
<i>See, the bomber took the clock's</i>
<i>going forward into account</i>

30:12.480 --> 30:13.480
<i>when he set the timer.</i>

30:15.800 --> 30:17.040
<i>An African Catholic priest,</i>

30:17.120 --> 30:18.640
<i>two Vietnamese Buddhists,</i>

30:18.720 --> 30:21.560
<i>faith, race, outsiders.</i>

30:22.920 --> 30:26.720
<i>Why would Mr. MacAfee</i>
<i>commit such a crime?</i>

30:26.800 --> 30:29.680
<i>He doesn't fit the profile</i>

30:29.760 --> 30:32.120
<i>murder and dismemberment</i>

30:32.200 --> 30:34.120
<i>are carried out by misfits</i>

30:34.200 --> 30:36.080
<i>outside a socially vulnerable-</i>

30:36.160 --> 30:39.160
<i>The forensic science</i>
<i>evidence is compelling.</i>

30:39.240 --> 30:40.960
<i>Professor Torrance retrieved</i>

30:41.040 --> 30:42.760
<i>Marie Monroe's hyoid bone</i>

30:42.840 --> 30:45.640
<i>and established, it was</i>
<i>broken before she died.</i>

30:45.720 --> 30:46.840
<i>Who should blame a girl</i>

30:47.880 --> 30:50.680
<i>for contorting everything</i>

30:50.760 --> 30:52.760
<i>to suit her overwhelming desire</i>

30:52.840 --> 30:54.160
<i>to solve the mystery</i>
<i>of her mother's murder?</i>

30:54.240 --> 30:56.960
<i>Phone records and voicemails</i>

30:57.040 --> 31:00.560
<i>prove Phil MacAfee's</i>
<i>connection with Marie Monroe.</i>

31:00.640 --> 31:03.480
<i>Emma Hedges is a fantasist.</i>

31:03.560 --> 31:06.200
<i>Daniel MacAfee fail</i>
<i>on the hospital</i>

31:06.280 --> 31:07.960
<i>and then went on to try</i>
<i>and implicate his father-</i>

31:08.040 --> 31:09.880
<i>- Mr. MacAfee-</i>
<i>- ... at pit of lions.</i>

31:09.960 --> 31:12.280
<i>... asked us to consider</i>
<i>that some other person</i>

31:12.360 --> 31:14.160
<i>took his discarded</i>
<i>boots from a bin</i>

31:14.240 --> 31:16.440
<i>and wore them while</i>
<i>murdering Marie Monroe,</i>

31:16.520 --> 31:18.000
<i>who Mr. MacAfee knew.</i>

31:18.080 --> 31:19.920
<i>This is a historic model.</i>

31:20.000 --> 31:21.880
<i>It's 19 years in the past</i>

31:21.960 --> 31:25.640
<i>with no eye witnesses,</i>
<i>with no CCTV.</i>

31:25.720 --> 31:30.200
<i>If you have doubt, then</i>
<i>you have to by law,</i>

31:30.280 --> 31:34.320
<i>give the accused the</i>
<i>benefit of that boot.</i>

31:34.400 --> 31:36.960
<i>There are two verdicts</i>
<i>of acquittal, Scotland,</i>

31:37.040 --> 31:37.800
<i>not guilty,</i>

31:39.480 --> 31:41.080
<i>and not proven.</i>

31:41.160 --> 31:44.720
<i>I ask you to consider the far</i>
<i>more plausible explanation,</i>

31:44.800 --> 31:47.360
<i>borne out by forensic evidence,</i>

31:47.440 --> 31:50.560
<i>Mr. MacAfee wearing</i>
<i>his own boots,</i>

31:50.640 --> 31:53.480
<i>murdered, dismembered</i>
<i>Marie Monroe,</i>

31:54.880 --> 31:56.560
<i>and then try to get</i>
<i>rid of the evidence.</i>

32:02.000 --> 32:03.960
<i>Hey, auntie.</i>

32:04.040 --> 32:07.160
<i>Had to commit them, Kathy's PhD.</i>

32:07.240 --> 32:08.960
<i>The Dean just invited me to run</i>

32:09.040 --> 32:12.840
<i>a big new undergraduate</i>
<i>course in forensics.</i>

32:12.920 --> 32:15.560
<i>I said, I don't wanna run</i>
<i>a new undergraduate course</i>

32:15.640 --> 32:17.520
<i>in forensic science</i>

32:17.600 --> 32:19.440
<i>because we already run</i>
<i>the course we want,</i>

32:19.520 --> 32:21.080
<i>and there isn't enough work</i>
<i>out there to justify it.</i>

32:21.160 --> 32:22.520
<i>What'd she say?</i>

32:22.600 --> 32:23.800
<i>She said I was principled,</i>

32:23.880 --> 32:25.680
<i>but she made it sound dirty.</i>

32:25.760 --> 32:27.800
<i>Oh, these are cute.</i>

32:27.880 --> 32:28.760
<i>Have you heard of black pill?</i>

32:28.840 --> 32:29.960
<i>No.</i>

32:30.040 --> 32:30.920
<i>Have you heard of incel?</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:32.960
<i>Sure, loser boys who hate women.</i>

32:33.040 --> 32:33.840
<i>Incel.</i>

32:33.920 --> 32:35.160
<i>Involuntary celibate,</i>

32:35.240 --> 32:37.480
<i>it's an American thing, why?</i>

32:37.560 --> 32:38.720
<i>When you search black pill,</i>

32:38.800 --> 32:40.720
<i>it's the first</i>
<i>thing that comes up.</i>

32:40.800 --> 32:42.160
<i>Do you remember the matrix?</i>

32:42.240 --> 32:44.680
<i>Keanu Reeves the</i>
<i>introducer, vividly.</i>

32:44.760 --> 32:46.520
<i>Carrie-Anne Moss</i>
<i>and PVC vividly.</i>

32:54.640 --> 32:55.840
<i>I'm not just his advocate,</i>

32:55.920 --> 32:58.080
<i>against Phil MacAfee</i>
<i>to court to number one.</i>

33:05.880 --> 33:07.800
<i>Could be fixing a punture,</i>

33:07.880 --> 33:09.640
<i>could be rigging a condom</i>
<i>and a draw for an acid,</i>

33:09.720 --> 33:11.160
<i>could be a man or a woman.</i>

33:12.160 --> 33:13.400
<i>How far from the nail bar?</i>

33:13.480 --> 33:14.880
<i>About four minutes on foot,</i>

33:14.960 --> 33:17.000
<i>it fits with what professor</i>
<i>Gordon sent on us.</i>

33:17.080 --> 33:18.280
<i>I recognise the Dundee's logo.</i>

33:18.360 --> 33:19.320
<i>Me too.</i>

33:19.400 --> 33:20.680
<i>A couple of witnesses mentioned</i>

33:20.760 --> 33:21.720
<i>for deliberative bikes</i>
<i>on the pavements but.</i>

33:21.800 --> 33:23.960
<i>They're always on a pavement.</i>

33:24.040 --> 33:27.000
<i>Okay, well, let's</i>
<i>go into Dundee's,</i>

33:27.080 --> 33:28.320
<i>find out which of the writers</i>

33:28.400 --> 33:30.200
<i>was working in that</i>
<i>area on that day,</i>

33:30.280 --> 33:31.840
<i>it'll all be on GPS.</i>

33:31.920 --> 33:32.680
<i>Hey, good work.</i>

33:37.520 --> 33:40.720
<i>come on,</i>
<i>come on, come on.</i>

33:46.080 --> 33:47.720
<i>Have you</i>
<i>reached a verdict?</i>

33:49.560 --> 33:50.320
<i>Yes.</i>

33:55.600 --> 33:57.520
<i>What is that verdict?</i>

33:57.600 --> 33:58.600
<i>Not proven</i>

34:01.160 --> 34:04.400
<i>Is that day</i>
<i>unanimous or by majority?</i>

34:05.520 --> 34:07.120
<i>Majority.</i>

34:07.200 --> 34:09.400
<i>Stand up. Mr. MacAfee.</i>

34:11.400 --> 34:15.280
<i>The jury has found the charges</i>
<i>against you not proven.</i>

34:16.440 --> 34:17.400
<i>You're free to go.</i>

34:43.760 --> 34:46.760
<i>You gotta be joking, not proven.</i>

34:46.840 --> 34:48.120
<i>Safi, you know what</i>
<i>they call not proven?</i>

34:48.200 --> 34:49.000
<i>No boss.</i>

34:49.080 --> 34:50.520
<i>The bastard rabbit.</i>

34:50.600 --> 34:52.960
<i>We should ditch it,</i>
<i>guilty people walk free.</i>

34:54.520 --> 34:55.320
<i>Oh, no.</i>

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
<i>- This is the-</i>
<i>- God, yes, not proven.</i>

34:58.680 --> 34:59.920
<i>People are so stupid,</i>

35:00.000 --> 35:01.480
<i>it's not that they</i>
<i>don't understand facts,</i>

35:01.560 --> 35:03.240
<i>they don't want them. They</i>
<i>prefer to go with how they feel.</i>

35:03.320 --> 35:04.960
<i>It's just,</i>

35:05.040 --> 35:06.320
<i>- Do you want to hug?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

35:10.800 --> 35:13.840
<i>- Emma?</i>

35:17.920 --> 35:18.720
<i>Emma?</i>

35:42.640 --> 35:45.520
<i>Let's try a comparison</i>
<i>between this ink</i>

35:45.600 --> 35:48.240
<i>- and the ink on the pill.</i>
<i>- Okay, cool.</i>

35:48.320 --> 35:50.800
<i>- Hi.</i>

35:52.480 --> 35:53.680
<i>Emma, I'm so sorry.</i>

35:54.680 --> 35:55.880
<i>Louise sorry to ask,</i>

35:55.960 --> 35:57.720
<i>but could I speak to</i>
<i>Prof. Gordon on my own?</i>

35:57.800 --> 35:58.560
<i>Of course.</i>

35:59.840 --> 36:01.880
<i>I'll be back in a minute.</i>

36:03.680 --> 36:04.480
<i>Come on.</i>

36:08.960 --> 36:10.480
<i>It's so unfair,</i>

36:10.560 --> 36:12.760
<i>it's so messed up</i>
<i>all that evidence,</i>

36:12.840 --> 36:15.600
<i>all that science and</i>
<i>he gets away with it.</i>

36:15.680 --> 36:17.120
<i>Doesn't it make you</i>
<i>want to give up?</i>

36:17.200 --> 36:19.360
<i>No, it makes me</i>
<i>even more determined</i>

36:19.440 --> 36:22.080
<i>to show up the signs</i>
<i>and get it understood.</i>

36:22.160 --> 36:22.960
<i>That's our work.</i>

36:45.720 --> 36:46.720
<i>Where is she?</i>

36:46.800 --> 36:48.080
<i>I wanna talk to her.</i>

36:48.160 --> 36:49.760
<i>Well, none of us</i>
<i>want to talk to you.</i>

36:55.080 --> 36:56.840
<i>Well, I can see Daniel,</i>

36:56.920 --> 36:58.520
<i>you're drying the Kool-Aid</i>

36:58.600 --> 37:00.320
<i>for the lion bitch on way,</i>

37:00.400 --> 37:02.160
<i>son, she's a cancer.</i>

37:02.240 --> 37:04.760
<i>She's a face like a slut ass.</i>

37:04.840 --> 37:07.280
<i>It's not just me,</i>
<i>look at your phone.</i>

37:07.360 --> 37:10.320
<i>They hate her, they hate you,</i>

37:12.080 --> 37:14.680
<i>- they love me.</i>

37:16.840 --> 37:18.720
<i>I wanna speak to</i>
<i>Emma, where is she?</i>

37:19.760 --> 37:22.200
<i>Don't worry, I'll find her.</i>

37:46.400 --> 37:48.080
<i>Not proven, what</i>
<i>does that even mean?</i>

37:50.280 --> 37:51.520
<i>Not guilty,</i>

37:51.600 --> 37:53.080
<i>you walk free and</i>
<i>that's the end of it.</i>

37:53.160 --> 37:54.160
<i>Guilty, you're locked up</i>

37:54.240 --> 37:55.840
<i>and everyone forgets about you.</i>

37:55.920 --> 37:58.240
<i>Not proven hangs over you.</i>

37:58.320 --> 37:59.880
<i>I've seen it happen,</i>
<i>you get dropped,</i>

37:59.960 --> 38:01.520
<i>your reputation</i>
<i>short, you're free,</i>

38:01.600 --> 38:04.160
<i>but you never shake</i>
<i>off the stigma,</i>

38:05.200 --> 38:06.280
<i>it's with you for life.</i>

38:07.600 --> 38:09.800
<i>Okay, ink from the</i>
<i>box, ink from the pill.</i>

38:52.440 --> 38:53.360
<i>Sarah.</i>

38:53.440 --> 38:55.840
<i>Hey, can you get to a computer?</i>

38:55.920 --> 38:56.720
<i>Hi.</i>

39:17.080 --> 39:19.800
<i>I see yellow pill has</i>
<i>been coloured in black,</i>

39:19.880 --> 39:22.480
<i>faint on the debris near the</i>
<i>epicentre of the new bubble.</i>

39:22.560 --> 39:24.440
<i>The same thing as</i>
<i>on the hashtag?</i>

39:24.520 --> 39:25.760
<i>The same kind of ink</i>

39:25.840 --> 39:27.640
<i>that was used to</i>
<i>write hashtag one</i>

39:27.720 --> 39:29.920
<i>on the box containing</i>
<i>the church hall bomb.</i>

39:30.000 --> 39:31.960
<i>Have you analysed the</i>
<i>contents of the fluid?</i>

39:32.040 --> 39:33.240
<i>We're doing it over night.</i>

39:35.840 --> 39:38.240
<i>Black pill, a state of despair,</i>

39:39.840 --> 39:41.320
<i>a fatalistic set of beliefs</i>

39:41.400 --> 39:44.240
<i>held by members of</i>
<i>the incel subculture,</i>

39:44.320 --> 39:46.080
<i>putting their own spin</i>
<i>on the red and blue pill</i>

39:46.160 --> 39:47.760
<i>co-opted from the matrix.</i>

39:47.840 --> 39:49.120
<i>What's incel?</i>

39:49.200 --> 39:51.200
<i>Involuntary celibate,</i>
<i>it's an American thing.</i>

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
<i>Well, that's an American thing</i>

39:56.800 --> 39:58.520
<i>using hashtag instead of number.</i>

39:58.600 --> 39:59.400
<i>It is.</i>

40:01.400 --> 40:05.120
<i>Black pill is suburban</i>
<i>area of Swansea B,</i>

40:05.200 --> 40:06.920
<i>three miles south</i>
<i>of the city centre.</i>

40:07.000 --> 40:08.560
<i>Black pill,</i>

40:08.640 --> 40:10.960
<i>fortified charcoal to treat</i>
<i>bloating and flatulence.</i>

40:13.880 --> 40:16.120
<i>Why would you call</i>
<i>it a pill in black?</i>

40:19.080 --> 40:20.600
<i>Wanted to look black,</i>

40:20.680 --> 40:23.120
<i>because you want it to be,</i>

40:24.360 --> 40:25.600
<i>understood as black.</i>

40:27.040 --> 40:28.960
<i>Interpreted as black.</i>

40:30.920 --> 40:32.400
<i>I need to get this, boss,</i>

40:33.760 --> 40:34.560
<i>okay.</i>

40:40.160 --> 40:41.880
<i>- Safi?</i>
<i>- Yes, boss.</i>

40:41.960 --> 40:44.360
<i>- I need you to come with me.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

40:44.440 --> 40:46.680
<i>Offices of the Dundee Times.</i>

40:46.760 --> 40:48.360
<i>Somebody sent them</i>
<i>an anonymous letter,</i>

40:48.440 --> 40:50.320
<i>claiming responsibility</i>
<i>for these bombs.</i>

40:50.400 --> 40:52.240
<i>We asked them not to</i>
<i>print it, they printed it.</i>

40:52.320 --> 40:53.520
<i>Have you seen it?</i>

40:53.600 --> 40:54.680
<i>Already on their</i>
<i>website, worst of it.</i>

40:54.760 --> 40:56.240
<i>What's the motivation?</i>

40:56.320 --> 40:57.120
<i>To sell papers,</i>

40:57.200 --> 40:58.480
<i>and makes it look like</i>

40:58.560 --> 40:59.440
<i>they're running</i>
<i>an investigation,</i>

40:59.520 --> 41:00.760
<i>we don't have a clue, bastards.</i>

41:00.840 --> 41:02.080
<i>- I mean, in a letter.</i>
<i>- Racist, far right?</i>

41:02.160 --> 41:03.800
<i>Do you think it's the real deal?</i>

41:03.880 --> 41:05.200
<i>We'll see,</i>

41:05.280 --> 41:06.920
<i>we'll go over here</i>
<i>and get the original.</i>

41:07.000 --> 41:08.760
<i>But one good thing</i>
<i>is handwritten</i>

41:08.840 --> 41:10.360
<i>- handwriting...</i>
<i>- Gives you away.</i>

41:11.440 --> 41:12.640
<i>I'm not scared of your dad.</i>

41:12.720 --> 41:14.920
<i>You should be, we both should.</i>

41:16.560 --> 41:17.880
<i>Please come with me.</i>

41:17.960 --> 41:18.960
<i>- Now?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

41:20.000 --> 41:21.920
<i>- Where?</i>
<i>- Anywhere.</i>

41:22.000 --> 41:23.640
<i>I don't know, whatever.</i>

41:23.720 --> 41:24.960
<i>But you can't do this.</i>

41:25.040 --> 41:26.320
<i>You can't just turn up here</i>

41:26.400 --> 41:28.840
<i>and spook me into</i>
<i>running off with you.</i>

41:28.920 --> 41:32.720
<i>I've got a job in there</i>
<i>which I absolutely love.</i>

41:32.800 --> 41:34.040
<i>Why do you catch yourself,</i>

41:34.120 --> 41:35.240
<i>and can carry on like</i>
<i>nothing's happened?</i>

41:36.640 --> 41:38.960
<i>Emma, nobody wants</i>
<i>us to be together.</i>

41:39.040 --> 41:40.800
<i>No one's on your side,</i>
<i>we need to get a way.</i>

41:40.880 --> 41:42.240
<i>You don't know what I need.</i>

41:44.920 --> 41:46.160
<i>This is mad.</i>

41:46.240 --> 41:48.320
<i>No, what we're being</i>
<i>through is mad.</i>

41:48.400 --> 41:49.400
<i>And if we don't</i>
<i>take ourselves away,</i>

41:49.480 --> 41:50.320
<i>we won't make it.</i>

41:52.000 --> 41:54.800
<i>Okay, it will never</i>
<i>be cleaner than now.</i>

41:56.080 --> 41:57.360
<i>We need to get a way,</i>

41:57.440 --> 41:58.960
<i>see what we've got to</i>
<i>give ourselves a chance</i>

41:59.040 --> 42:00.800
<i>to get away from</i>
<i>all the bastards,</i>

42:00.880 --> 42:02.040
<i>that's what we need to do.</i>

42:05.720 --> 42:07.840
<i>I love you and I</i>
<i>wanna be with you.</i>

42:09.320 --> 42:11.200
<i>And I think that you love me.</i>

42:11.280 --> 42:12.080
<i>No, forget it.</i>

42:14.440 --> 42:15.520
<i>It's not gonna happen.</i>

42:16.720 --> 42:18.280
<i>Why?</i>

42:18.360 --> 42:20.320
<i>Because I'm not gonna do it.</i>

42:20.400 --> 42:21.280
<i>Okay, but why?</i>

42:23.000 --> 42:23.760
<i>'Cause,</i>

42:25.400 --> 42:26.560
<i>I do love you,</i>

42:28.880 --> 42:30.680
<i>I do, but I think I</i>
<i>might hate you too.</i>

42:36.560 --> 42:38.200
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Because I hate your dad,</i>

42:39.440 --> 42:41.040
<i>and I hate what happened today.</i>

42:45.600 --> 42:46.400
<i>I know.</i>

42:50.240 --> 42:51.040
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

43:11.040 --> 43:13.520
<i>I love the verdict on my dad as,</i>

43:13.600 --> 43:14.360
<i>he did it,</i>

43:18.840 --> 43:21.440
<i>he never held a</i>
<i>Bible in his life</i>

43:22.800 --> 43:25.520
<i>or a .</i>

43:27.760 --> 43:29.280
<i>You lied for the</i>
<i>sake of your mom,</i>

43:32.120 --> 43:34.280
<i>my dad lied through his</i>
<i>teeth to save his skin.</i>

43:50.560 --> 43:52.200
<i>If you do need me,</i>

43:52.280 --> 43:53.440
<i>you can always come back.</i>

44:05.360 --> 44:06.240
<i>This would be easy</i>

44:06.320 --> 44:07.560
<i>if I didn't wanna be with you,</i>

44:09.720 --> 44:10.480
<i>but I do.</i>

44:13.880 --> 44:14.640
<i>Let's go.</i>
