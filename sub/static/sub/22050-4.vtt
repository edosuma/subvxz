WEBVTT

00:02.660 --> 00:06.500
You just betrayed us.
What's up with that?

00:06.600 --> 00:09.680
Hey. You forgot this Friday.

00:09.780 --> 00:10.940
Forgot where?

00:14.580 --> 00:15.720
In the cafeteria.

00:17.540 --> 00:18.800
Who's that dude?

00:20.000 --> 00:25.440
Do you know me and Sonja have
been dating since she was 15 or something?

00:46.540 --> 00:48.220
He only works.

00:49.380 --> 00:50.380
Suddenly it seems like money matters most.

00:50.380 --> 00:56.740
<i>[Hey thanks for yesterday, what's the plan today?</i>
Suddenly it seems like money matters most.

00:56.740 --> 00:56.800
Suddenly it seems like money matters most.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.160
He just...

01:01.220 --> 01:05.780
He becomes completely different when he's around his father.

01:08.780 --> 01:14.700
And his stockbroker colleagues.

01:16.300 --> 01:25.720
He looks up to his father so much.
He lights up when he walks into the room.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.060
I get it, because...

01:33.600 --> 01:36.140
He never got that validation before.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.620
But...

01:40.380 --> 01:43.920
When he finally gets that validation,
he becomes...

01:46.020 --> 01:48.120
He becomes a kid.

01:48.980 --> 01:52.940
But I can't live like that.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.120
No.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.060
Alone in London.

02:02.340 --> 02:06.520
Because I went there to be together with him.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.940
And now we're never together.

02:10.020 --> 02:10.680
Yeah.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.600
Yeah, yeah. I get it.

02:15.120 --> 02:20.340
To be completely honest,
it hasn't been so easy here at home either.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.580
I don't know, it's been a bit like…

02:23.320 --> 02:25.860
There's been a lot of chaos.

02:26.660 --> 02:31.740
One week I had to wipe myself with Linn's pads.
That's really...

02:33.040 --> 02:38.180
And Isak, he's a really good guy, but he's like…

02:38.740 --> 02:40.160
He's so lazy.

02:42.080 --> 02:42.620
Eskild?

02:44.420 --> 02:45.620
I'm sitting right here.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.040
Yeah.

02:48.600 --> 02:53.880
You have to endure hearing that I'm happy to see Noora again.
You don't have to be so jealous.

02:53.980 --> 02:54.860
I love you too.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.080
Jealous?! I'm not jealous.

02:59.260 --> 03:05.840
But we have to find a solution
because Noora's going to live here now

03:06.500 --> 03:08.660
we'll be with 4 in an apartment for 3.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.120
Are you serious?

03:13.340 --> 03:18.260
Noora just came home after being dumped by the man of her dreams.

03:18.260 --> 03:20.640
The only thing you're thinking about is the sleeping arrangements.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.600
Can't you sleep on the floor?

03:22.620 --> 03:25.740
I haven't been dumped.
-No, you weren't dumped but...

03:25.740 --> 03:29.460
It was me who left him there.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.580
We didn't break up.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.020
We have...

03:35.160 --> 03:37.160
taken a break.

03:43.320 --> 03:51.360
And if he really loves me,
he'll come after me.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.000
I think that...

03:59.760 --> 04:01.080
I don't know, but...

04:01.680 --> 04:06.480
People leave their wives and children
to be together with the one they love.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.980
And if he really loves you,
he'll choose you.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.520
I think it'll work out.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.080
At least it's really nice to have you home again.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.660
Are you happy to be back home?

04:28.940 --> 04:29.960
Does it taste good?

04:33.160 --> 04:33.820
Thanks.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.560
You're welcome.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.120
It was Linn who made it.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.720
I don't believe it.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.540
That's why it's not good.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.420
Hey.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.380
Hi!

05:34.480 --> 05:36.600
Are you going to the Halloween thing?

05:37.960 --> 05:41.020
Eh, no. Or maybe.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.020
I don't know. Are you?

05:43.440 --> 05:44.260
Join me?

05:46.380 --> 05:47.960
Okay!
-Okay?

05:47.960 --> 05:50.600
Yeah, hm.
-Great, then we'll do a pre-drink together?

05:51.080 --> 05:51.600
Yeah.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.300
Hey.
-Hi.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.960
Did you do anything fun this weekend?

06:07.820 --> 06:09.020
Eh, no.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.920
I tried to call you on Friday.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.900
Yeah I saw.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.900
But so damn much happened this weekend.

06:25.580 --> 06:28.200
Noora came home!
Did you hear about that?

06:28.300 --> 06:29.220
Yes.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.220
I heard you had a pre-drink.

06:34.620 --> 06:39.040
Yeah, yeah I did. No, I didn't really have it, but…

06:41.980 --> 06:48.520
Vilde pretty much forced me to have it.
She talked to Eskild.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.100
In the end I didn't have a choice.

06:51.100 --> 06:57.020
It was more like she was hosting it at my place.
It was really boring.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.660
It's not like you were missing out on anything.

07:02.860 --> 07:04.620
Magnus' birthday is on Saturday.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.200
No?
-Yeah.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.100
So Mahdi and me were thinking
of doing something cool for him.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.360
Yeah, I'm in.
-Yeah?

07:13.360 --> 07:15.960
We can make sure he'll have sex for the first time.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.680
On his birthday, yeah.
That'll be awesome.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.480
We need to call those dance chicks.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.540
Yes!
-He likes them.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.520
Or Vilde!

07:27.220 --> 07:29.140
Yes! Oh my god.

07:29.140 --> 07:32.300
So he can live out his SM dream.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.340
Yeah, dominatrix. Dominatrix.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.520
He isn't 100%. He's sick.

07:41.540 --> 07:48.020
... the donor's genes are thus spread to the
next generation when the receiver splits.

07:48.560 --> 07:54.760
Transferring genetics can be done in three different ways:

07:54.980 --> 07:59.420
Through conjugation, transformation, and transduction.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.840
Do you agree?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.260
Can you focus?

08:14.960 --> 08:16.840
Sana. I have a question.

08:18.340 --> 08:21.520
No offense, but why are you actually religious?

08:23.020 --> 08:26.720
It's 2016 and the world is progressing.

08:27.020 --> 08:31.100
You are a smart girl and you study exact sciences.
Don't you get that it's nonsense?

08:33.340 --> 08:35.540
Is something in my religion bothering you?

08:36.240 --> 08:42.660
Nothing specific, just you believing
there is only a right and a wrong.

08:42.660 --> 08:49.820
And that there's a god who decides
that and who says homosexuality isn't right.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.980
Or to eat hotdogs or whatever…

08:55.900 --> 08:57.460
What is it you believe in Isak?

08:57.620 --> 09:03.560
Me? I believe in science.
The theory of evolution. Nothing else.

09:05.260 --> 09:05.900
Okay.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.240
So let's look at the theory of evolution.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.660
How do you explain homosexuality within natural selection?

09:12.840 --> 09:13.500
Hm?

09:14.720 --> 09:19.400
Evolution wise homosexuality is a genetic dead end.

09:19.540 --> 09:22.200
Gay people don't progress the world.

09:22.480 --> 09:27.860
So according to the theory of evolution,
they should have already been extinct millions of years ago.

09:29.100 --> 09:34.000
Unless homosexuality is not genetic, but rather a disease.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.760
Or a choice people make.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.860
What do you think about that?

09:40.080 --> 09:44.320
I don't fucking know. I don't go around
thinking about homosexuality all the time.

09:45.340 --> 09:46.080
No.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.200
So since you don't have the answer to everything

09:49.720 --> 09:55.140
can't we just agree that there's a lot
between heaven and earth none of us know about?

09:56.440 --> 10:02.260
Instead of sitting here criticizing my religion,
just respect that we have chosen different beliefs.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.840
Okay, whatever.
-Hey!

10:04.300 --> 10:08.340
I talked so Sonja and she was wondering
if we could have the pre-drink at your place?

10:09.320 --> 10:09.880
Huh?

10:10.940 --> 10:13.120
Sonja. Even's girlfriend.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.380
Yeah?

10:15.580 --> 10:20.020
She said you and Even planned a
pre-drink before the Halloween party.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.400
With us.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.620
Yeah, hm-hm.
-Yeah! Cool.

10:26.620 --> 10:31.800
Sonja and Even will dress up as God and an angel.

10:32.020 --> 10:34.900
So I thought it'd be awesome if we matched as well.

10:35.320 --> 10:41.280
If we dress up as a cat and a mouse,
or Batman and Batwoman or something?

10:43.440 --> 10:46.800
If you think that's fun?
Only if you think it's fun.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.980
But I'll text you.

10:48.980 --> 10:49.800
Hello?

10:55.660 --> 10:57.500
What is it? Shit.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.280
… sexual reproduction.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.820
Or was that what you just talked about?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.660
No? Okay.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.920
Should I read it out loud?

11:14.700 --> 11:18.220
<i>(more biology talk)</i>

11:23.200 --> 11:24.220
Sounds easy!

11:30.660 --> 11:35.980
Now that I'm not going to school,
I don't really know what to do.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.820
I miss having something to do.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.980
What do you miss most?

11:40.520 --> 11:43.560
Having something to do during the day.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.840
I'm pretty bored.

11:45.760 --> 11:51.240
I've thought about that as well.
We've gone to school for 10 years.

11:53.260 --> 11:58.760
But just going to school.
Being in the theatre for example.

11:59.740 --> 12:04.380
Are you with the theatre?
-Yes! I don't understand people who don't want to join.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.900
It's a bit weird.
-It's really weird.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.740
Were you in it?
-Yes, all three years.

12:09.740 --> 12:12.300
All three years?
-Yeah, I'm three years older than you.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.300
Are you from '97? No!

12:14.900 --> 12:17.360
It's really nice.
Despite the age difference.

12:20.140 --> 12:23.480
It's so nice talking to you, I didn't notice...
-Yeah, same for me!

12:23.560 --> 12:25.320
Didn't think of the age difference.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.240
Are you one year older than Even?

12:29.520 --> 12:30.980
No, I'm from '97 too.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.320
Can you please calm
down a little with the beer?

12:36.520 --> 12:38.140
Can you stop watching over me?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.140
I mean it, stop monitoring me.

12:48.700 --> 12:52.860
Where the toilet?
-In the corridor, on your right.

13:15.460 --> 13:19.540
I heard a lot of people are coming to the party.
-What time is it?

13:19.920 --> 13:22.320
Hm?
-What time is it?

13:24.060 --> 13:25.620
21:21

13:26.560 --> 13:27.300
Seriously?

13:30.060 --> 13:32.040
Yeah, why?

13:34.540 --> 13:35.640
We're going.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.180
Where?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.220
Wherever.

14:52.340 --> 14:54.840
I feel like swimming.
Don't you?

14:56.240 --> 14:58.420
Swimming?
-Yeah!

15:16.920 --> 15:19.800
Who lives here?
-My aunt.

15:25.220 --> 15:29.280
And she's okay with us being here?
-Of course. Not a problem.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.700
Where is your aunt?

15:37.120 --> 15:38.560
She's on holiday.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.440
Why don't you have the keys?

15:43.060 --> 15:44.800
Because she's on holiday.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.920
That's the answer to everything.
-Relax! Don't worry.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.540
You coming?

16:11.900 --> 16:12.560
Okay!

16:13.640 --> 16:14.860
Why are you so skeptical?

16:17.180 --> 16:23.100
I'm not skeptical, but it's a bit weird we're going to...
-Are you scared of swimming?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.540
Scared of swimming?
-Yeah.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.620
Do you have a fear of water?
-Fear of water?!

16:27.620 --> 16:29.120
Fear of water, yes.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.960
It isn't my aunt's house.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.180
So you're just scared to fuck up your hair?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.960
You think I care about my hair?
-What should I think?

16:43.000 --> 16:46.380
It looks like it.
-Does it look like I care about my hair?

16:46.920 --> 16:49.280
Not right now, but usually it does.

17:03.780 --> 17:06.480
You thought I died?
-Yeah I got so scared.

17:08.380 --> 17:13.480
You suck at holding your breath?
-I suck? Try it yourself.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.300
Are you challenging me?

17:15.300 --> 17:19.980
I'm the master at holding my breath.
-Show me.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.060
Okay fine.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.520
Wow!

17:31.520 --> 17:35.900
You never cease to impress.
-I got water in my lungs.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.160
Yeah right!
-I swallowed water!

17:38.160 --> 17:40.160
Okay!
-I'll try again.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.160
Now together.
-Together?

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
On three?
-Last one to come up wins.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.560
Ready?
-We're going together on three.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.780
No, on 1.
3, 2, 1!

18:17.700 --> 18:20.340
Yes!
-Yes what?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.060
I won!

18:22.020 --> 18:24.780
Yes?! No! That was cheating.
-I won! Are you kidding?

18:24.780 --> 18:25.500
What?!

18:25.500 --> 18:26.560
That was cheating.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.560
You think there are rules here?
-Yes!

18:30.000 --> 18:31.440
What did you think?

18:32.960 --> 18:36.460
But that's just cheating!
You can't do that.

18:36.460 --> 18:39.140
I don't accept losing like that.
-Then let's do it again.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.580
MOM!

19:25.580 --> 19:28.280
Fuck fuck fuck!
-Fucking hell!

19:30.360 --> 19:31.720
Who the hell is she?!

19:35.620 --> 19:37.340
Who lives here?

19:37.600 --> 19:39.720
Someone I went to elementary school with.
