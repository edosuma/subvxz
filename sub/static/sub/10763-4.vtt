WEBVTT

00:09.242 --> 00:10.744
Oh, now look at that couch.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.746
Now this is something you could
consider for your new office,

00:12.746 --> 00:13.747
although I'm not
sure how well--

00:13.747 --> 00:15.237
what is that-- sort of
linen is going to wear...

00:15.749 --> 00:16.750
Oh, you know what I'm going to wear

00:16.750 --> 00:18.685
to the opera fund-raiser
on Friday night...

00:18.685 --> 00:20.186
or is it Saturday? I'll check my book .

00:20.186 --> 00:22.677
A lovely linen shirt
with my new Zegna suit.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.679
That's a funny word, "Zegna. "

00:25.191 --> 00:25.692
The "g" is silent.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.427
Silent "g" like lasagna.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.629
Niles? Yes?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.064
Do you notice that?

00:31.064 --> 00:33.532
You've been awfully chatty lately.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.235
No, but Daphne mentioned
it to me this morning.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.224
Ooh, what about this one?

00:36.403 --> 00:37.470
Frasier, you really
must make a decision.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.172
We've been to six stores already.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.469
Oh, and that reminds me.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.375
I must cancel our
squash game tomorrow...

00:42.375 --> 00:44.244
Don't you hear that?

00:44.244 --> 00:45.578
Yes, now that you mention it, I do.

00:45.578 --> 00:46.579
It's sort of like a
nervous tic of some kind .

00:46.579 --> 00:47.568
I wonder what could be causing it.

00:48.081 --> 00:50.083
Well, let's see-- you do
have a baby on the way.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.085
Perhaps your incessant jabbering

00:52.085 --> 00:54.087
is just a way of distracting yourself

00:54.087 --> 00:55.588
from this life-changing event.

00:55.588 --> 00:58.079
How could I have missed
something so obvious?

00:58.591 --> 01:01.094
Well, it's not so hard to believe.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.085
You were 1 5 before you
realiZed there was a correlation

01:03.596 --> 01:04.584
between getting beaten up every day

01:05.098 --> 01:06.087
and going to school in a Panama hat.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.104
(whispering) : Niles! Mm-hmm.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.594
Does that woman look familiar to you?

01:13.106 --> 01:14.107
No, but you know what does?

01:14.107 --> 01:15.608
This couch... we're
back where we started.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.177
Will you pick something?

01:17.177 --> 01:18.778
Oh, my God.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.769
That's Ronee Lawrence.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.282
Who?

01:22.282 --> 01:24.284
She used to baby-sit for us.

01:24.284 --> 01:27.787
Oh, my God. I-I had a crush on her.

01:27.787 --> 01:31.291
She's the first girl
to ever break my heart.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.280
I used to watch her through the banister

01:32.792 --> 01:35.784
making out with her boyfriend... chad.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.199
Ronee Lawrence...

01:39.199 --> 01:41.201
she's the fiend who told me

01:41.201 --> 01:43.135
all those ghastly bedtime stories

01:43.603 --> 01:46.306
about tiny insects that
would crawl into my ears

01:46.306 --> 01:48.308
and eat my brain.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.605
Earwigs.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.312
I-I wore a football helmet to bed

01:52.312 --> 01:54.314
for a month after that.

01:54.314 --> 01:55.315
Yes, yes, I know.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.618
You really had Dad's
hopes up there for a while.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.521
Excuse me... are you Ronee Lawrence?

02:01.521 --> 02:05.225
Well, that's what it
says on my driver's...

02:05.225 --> 02:06.226
Wait a sec.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.527
Frasier?

02:07.527 --> 02:10.229
Hello, Ronee. Oh, my God, it is you!

02:10.229 --> 02:11.531
Good to see you.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.233
Niles and I were just...

02:13.233 --> 02:14.534
Niles... oh, my God.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.236
Little nervous Niles.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.537
I can't believe it!

02:17.537 --> 02:19.539
Well, it's all terribly true.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.541
Wow, you look fantastic.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.243
Oh, well, it's a lot of work.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.245
Of course it is-- you
know, exercise, dieting...

02:25.245 --> 02:28.248
No, I've had a lot of work.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.239
Every time anything sags, drags or bags,

02:30.550 --> 02:32.552
I get Dr. Goldman right on top of it.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.254
And then I call a plastic surgeon.

02:34.254 --> 02:35.555
 Oh... that's funny.

02:35.555 --> 02:37.257
Well, it's nice running into you.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.559
FRASIER: Oh, Niles, we've
got a moment, I think.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.261
So what have you been up to?

02:41.261 --> 02:42.262
Oh, I sing and play the piano

02:42.262 --> 02:43.251
at the Wellington Hotel.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.265
Oh, great, great.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.267
Of course I know what you do,

02:47.267 --> 02:48.564
Mr. Big
- Time Radio Shrink.

02:49.269 --> 02:51.571
Well, actually, I'm getting ba
into private practice as well.

02:51.571 --> 02:52.605
In fact, we're here today,

02:52.605 --> 02:54.300
picking out a couch for my new office.

02:54.574 --> 02:58.578
I saw you checking
out the Barcaloungers.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.281
You... buying a chair for your husband?

03:01.281 --> 03:03.583
Only if it's wired for electricity.

03:03.583 --> 03:04.584
We're divorced.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.586
Oh... oh, well...

03:06.586 --> 03:08.288
You know, you must come by the house

03:08.288 --> 03:09.277
to do a proper catch-up.

03:09.589 --> 03:10.590
I know my Dad would
love to see you again.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.581
RONEE: Actually, I'm free tonight.

03:13.293 --> 03:15.295
Well, then how about
cocktails around 7:00?

03:15.295 --> 03:17.597
I'm at the Elliot Bay
Towers on the counterbalance.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.599
Great. It'll be just like old times,

03:19.599 --> 03:21.301
except you get to stay up late.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.602
Hey, Niles, do you remember

03:22.602 --> 03:25.605
when I used to tell you
those scary bedtime stories?

03:25.605 --> 03:26.594
No, not really.

03:28.308 --> 03:31.311
Yeah, you thought there were earwig eggs

03:31.311 --> 03:32.612
on all the furniture

03:32.612 --> 03:34.614
and you started taking
one of those hankies out

03:34.614 --> 03:37.310
and wiping off all the chairs
before you'd sit in them

03:37.617 --> 03:41.621
because you were afraid
that whoo-whoo-whoo.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.623
 Nothing still. I'm sorry.

03:43.623 --> 03:44.612
I'm glad.

03:45.325 --> 03:46.326
For a while there, I was afraid

03:46.326 --> 03:50.630
that maybe I'd scarred
you for life. Bloop.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.332
Well, I gotta run.
I'll see you guys tonight.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.334
All right. Bye.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.336
(laughing)

03:56.336 --> 03:57.325
Okay, go ahead, Niles.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.340
Oh, she put her fingers in my ears...

04:00.340 --> 04:01.341
I understand.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.332
Yeah, give it a good wipe. That's it.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.303
So, Frasier, did you find a couch?

04:08.615 --> 04:10.316
No. I must have tested 1 00 for him.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.307
You know, have some sympathy, Niles.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.610
Obviously my foot-dragging
is a kind of avoidance.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.017
After all, I haven't been in
private practice for 1 2 years.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.959
Maybe I don't have the skills anymore.

04:19.959 --> 04:20.959
Don't worry.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.450
Your patients will never notice.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.367
Well, if he doesn't pick a couch soon,

04:27.367 --> 04:28.868
his patients will be lying on the floor.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.770
 What is this? Oh, it's
 olive tapenade, mmm.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.405
You're going to an awful lot of trouble

04:32.405 --> 04:33.740
for a "drop by sometime"
kind of evening.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.435
Here, Daphne, try this
one... Oh, try one...

04:35.742 --> 04:36.743
Oh-oh-oh,
spring rolls.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.711
... Oh, we found the
best chinese restaurant

04:38.711 --> 04:40.413
Niles! Sorry, darling.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.715
Still got the gift of gab, I see.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.650
I really don't know why you
insisted we be here tonight.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.353
I just didn't want Ronee to think

04:47.353 --> 04:48.342
I was coming on too strong.

04:48.655 --> 04:51.357
I was hoping this reunion
might start a countdown

04:51.357 --> 04:57.363
toward a future lift-off
from cape crane-averal.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.299
If you tortured that metaphor any more,

04:59.299 --> 05:00.596
you'd be before a tribunal in The Hague.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.636
FRASIER: Oh, Dad, hey.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.637
Hey, guys.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.440
Wow, what's with the fancy spread?

05:07.440 --> 05:09.509
day Niles and I ran
into Ronee Lawrence to

05:09.509 --> 05:11.010
and she's coming over for cocktails.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.512
You remember-- our
old baby-sitter.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.513
Oh, yeah, I remember Ronee.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.014
Pretty little thing, yeah.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.516
How's she looking these days?

05:16.516 --> 05:18.017
Had her eyes pulled so tight,

05:18.017 --> 05:19.507
she could land a role
in Flower Drum Song

05:23.489 --> 05:24.791
She happens to look fabulous.

05:24.791 --> 05:25.792
(doorbell rings)

05:25.792 --> 05:27.794
Which you will soon see for yourself.

05:27.794 --> 05:31.798
She's playing piano
down at the Wellington.

05:31.798 --> 05:33.800
Ronee, hi. come on in.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.495
Good to see you.

05:35.802 --> 05:36.791
Meet my
sister-in-law, Daphne.

05:37.403 --> 05:38.504
Hi. Nice to meet you.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.506
FRASIER: Remember my Dad?

05:40.506 --> 05:42.497
Oh, I sure do. How are you, Mr. crane?

05:42.608 --> 05:44.377
 It's Marty and I'm just great.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.380
Gee, you haven't changed a bit.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.543
Oh, yes, I have. I can legally drink now.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.953
Hint, hint.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.822
Oh, right. Would you
like a glass of wine?

05:55.822 --> 05:56.889
Yes, thank you.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.379
Dad, why don't you get yourself a beer?

05:58.758 --> 06:00.526
So, Ronee, what have you
been doing all these years?

06:00.526 --> 06:01.494
RONEE: Singing, mostly.

06:01.494 --> 06:02.695
I play at the RendeZvous Room

06:02.695 --> 06:04.130
down at the Wellington Hotel.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.631
Is that that place that revolves?

06:05.631 --> 06:07.121
It used to. It broke two years ago.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.624
(laughing) : That's terrific.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.605
RONEE: Yeah, I had a couple
of shots at the big time:

06:12.605 --> 06:13.663
You know, sang in some swanky rooms.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.442
I even made an album: "Ronee Lawrence:

06:16.442 --> 06:17.932
Mood Swings. "

06:21.481 --> 06:23.649
It sold about seven copies

06:23.649 --> 06:26.853
and that's when Ronee Lawrence
had herself a real mood swing.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.422
Well, I'm sure the
album was just wonderful.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.424
You know, maybe I could interest you

06:31.424 --> 06:32.425
in a duet a little later?

06:32.425 --> 06:33.426
Oh, that'd be fun.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.428
Wouldn't it, though?

06:35.428 --> 06:37.419
I have a feeling that our
musical styles just might harmo...

06:37.930 --> 06:38.919
t MARTIN: So, Ronee, I'll be

06:39.432 --> 06:40.433
you really wow 'em at the RendeZvous.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.935
Well, you know it's no
t exactly carnegie Hall.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.437
Most of them are half in the bag

06:44.437 --> 06:46.439
and just trying not
to spill their drinks.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.499
And I'm just talking about
the cocktail waitresses.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.778
This girl's a riot!

06:51.778 --> 06:52.745
Dad, could you help me

06:52.745 --> 06:54.747
with something in the kitchen?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.449
Now? Right now.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.751
Hey, don't be too long, you two.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.740
Mama likes an audience.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.750
Good, 'cause Daddy likes to watch.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.459
What the hell do you think you're doing?

07:06.459 --> 07:08.461
I was working my magic on her.

07:08.461 --> 07:09.462
Why are you so upset?

07:09.462 --> 07:11.464
Because I'm working a
little magic of my own

07:11.464 --> 07:13.099
and your magic is mucking up my magic.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.600
I thought you brought her here for me.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.838
Since when do I "bring" you women?

07:18.838 --> 07:23.142
What are you, the Sultan of Brunei?

07:23.142 --> 07:25.144
(cell phone rings)

07:25.144 --> 07:27.013
Hello?

07:27.013 --> 07:29.649
What?

07:29.649 --> 07:31.684
Oh, you're kidding.

07:31.684 --> 07:34.187
Yeah... yeah, okay, I guess.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.955
I'll see you in a bit. Something wrong?

07:35.955 --> 07:37.557
Oh, I have to go into work.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.025
I can't believe it.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.060
The guy who fills in on my
night off called in sick.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.061
Oh, no. Sorry.

07:42.061 --> 07:44.664
Promise me we'll do this again.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.599
Oh, you know we will. count on that.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.900
couldn't keep us away.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.889
Frasier, you owe me a duet.

07:49.602 --> 07:50.903
It was great to see you, Marty.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.599
You should all come down
to the club sometime.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.608
You can count on that, too.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.609
We'll be there with bells on.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.611
Bye.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.602
Bye-bye. See you later.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.917
I can't believe the way
you are humiliating yourself,

08:04.917 --> 08:06.519
a man your age.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.720
Hey, she was flirting with me.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.711
She was flirting with me.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.713
You just got caught in the crossfire.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.760
Daphne, which one of
us was she attracted to?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.729
How stupid do you think I am?

08:16.729 --> 08:20.233
Does it say "stupid" on me forehead?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.724
Fine. If you insist on
humiliating yourself, how's this:

08:23.236 --> 08:25.738
I'll invite Ronee over
for dinner this weekend

08:25.738 --> 08:27.240
and she can choose for herself.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.730
Agreed? Fine.

08:29.242 --> 08:32.245
Make sure she brings a friend
so there's someone for you.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.236
I'm going to McGinty's.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.553
You don't suppose he's sneaking down

08:40.553 --> 08:41.246
to the RendeZvous, do you?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.688
No. Only a scoundrel

08:43.688 --> 08:44.678
would violate a gentleman's
agreement that way.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.181
Quite right.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.196
Dad is nothing if not an honorable man.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.698
I don't know what I was thinking.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.097
can we give you a lift down there?

08:54.600 --> 08:56.602
No, I want to freshen up first.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.092
See yourselves out.

09:02.608 --> 09:07.980
e?? ?? Don't change a hair for m

09:07.980 --> 09:11.677
You've only got the two.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.987
♪♪ Not if you care for me...♪♪

09:14.987 --> 09:16.682
It's a good thing you've got money.

09:18.691 --> 09:26.832
♪♪ Stay, little valentine, stay...♪♪

09:26.832 --> 09:29.835

09:29.835 --> 09:36.709
?? ... ?? Each day is valentine's Day

09:36.709 --> 09:39.143
(applause)

09:44.350 --> 09:46.686
I'm going to take a little break.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.689
Try not to kill yourselves
from disappointment, hmm?

09:49.689 --> 09:52.191
Hey! Frasier, what a nice surprise.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.194
I guess I just didn't want our
little reunion to end so abruptly.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.684
Well, you're not the only one.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.198
I had a feeling you might say that.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.700
There you go, Ronee.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.201
Thanks. Hey, Fras.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.704
Dad! Yeah, Marty didn't want
to call it a night, either.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.205
He's quite the party guy.

10:06.205 --> 10:09.197
Walter, you're alive!

10:09.709 --> 10:11.210
You said you were going to McGinty's.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.678
How long have you been here?

10:12.678 --> 10:14.680
45 minutes-- you
shouldn't have spent

10:14.680 --> 10:15.681
so much time on your hair, Louise.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.683
So, boys, who needs a drink?

10:17.683 --> 10:20.186
Yeah, I'll have another beer.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.188
You know, Dad, you really
ought to slow down there.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.190
You know, at his age,
one slip and it's the Icu

10:24.190 --> 10:26.192
and then it's "I see you later".

10:26.192 --> 10:28.683
Well, I wouldn't worry about me, Fras.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.696
I don't feel any older now than I did

10:30.696 --> 10:33.199
when you were parading
around in your mother's heels.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.689
(chuckling) : Oh, well...

10:35.201 --> 10:36.869
'course, that was just last christmas.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.904
Listen, I've got to do another set.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.407
Are you going to stick around?

10:41.407 --> 10:43.909
Oh, you bet we are. Yeah, sure,
wouldn't miss it. Oh, absolutely, yeah

10:43.909 --> 10:45.411
Ronee got me a ringside
table right next to her.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.912
And that's because I want you

10:46.912 --> 10:49.415
and your pockets right near my tip jar.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.906
Oh, you're after my money, huh?

10:52.418 --> 10:53.919
Say, Ronee, it's
such a beautiful piano.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.910
It's a shame we didn't get
a chance to do our duet.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.424
Well, let's do it now. Really?

10:58.424 --> 10:59.925
Sure. You don't mind scrunching, do you?

10:59.925 --> 11:01.427
My bench is a little small.

11:01.427 --> 11:05.420
I don't mind scrunching at all.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.433
RONEE: Hey, listen, is it just me

11:07.433 --> 11:10.736
or am I getting some
signals here tonight?

11:10.736 --> 11:14.440
Oh, it is most definitely not just you.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.343
Hi, drinkers. I'm back.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.780
And no, no, you're not
seeing double, for once--

11:20.780 --> 11:22.782
I have a guest with me tonight.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.251
Believe it or not, I
used to baby-sit this guy.

11:25.251 --> 11:29.187
I know. I know. How
does she stay so young?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.024
AUDIENcE MEMBERS: Dr. Goldman!

11:39.498 --> 11:40.466

11:40.466 --> 11:41.455
Oh, I love this song.

11:41.967 --> 11:42.956
Oh, me, too.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.471
You know, and I'd like to
sing it to someone special

11:45.471 --> 11:46.972
who's here tonight, but, well,

11:46.972 --> 11:49.275
I'm afraid it might embarrass him.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.835
Oh, I'm sure your special someone
would just love to hear it.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.379
Really?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.849

Frasier? Do you realiZe
the door is wide open?

13:08.888 --> 13:10.322
Yeah.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.793
PiZZa guy forgot to
close it when he left.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.796
Don 't you remember?

We had plans to watch
Don Giovannion PBS.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.905
Wow, you look awfully dapper.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.907
Yeah, I'm meeting a friend.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.408
Dad, you don't have to be so coy.

13:29.408 --> 13:30.910
I know where you're going.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.412
I'm having dinner with Ronee .

13:33.412 --> 13:34.914
So things are going well? Oh, yeah.

13:34.914 --> 13:35.915
Great, great.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.917
Turns out she had a crush on me

13:37.917 --> 13:40.408
back in the days she
used to sit with you boys.

13:42.521 --> 13:43.522
Well, I better scoot.

13:43.522 --> 13:45.024
See you, boys.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.423
NILES: Bye, Dad.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.259
Ooh, are those profiteroles?

13:54.033 --> 13:56.535
Sorry. Did you want one?

13:56.535 --> 13:59.038
No, but thanks for offering.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.006
Frasier, what's going on with you?

14:01.006 --> 14:04.009
You're showing classic
signs of depression.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.012
That's because I'm depressed you nit.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.479
But why?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.003
Ronee and you aren't compatible.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.951
You have few interests in common.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.853
. She's as coarse as sandpaper..

14:13.853 --> 14:15.921
I know. I know there was
no future for me and Ronee.

14:15.921 --> 14:16.922
.. It's just.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.219
I'm depressed, Niles.

14:18.924 --> 14:19.925
I... I...

14:19.925 --> 14:21.222
I don't know why.

14:23.495 --> 14:24.860
Wait a minute.

14:25.130 --> 14:26.866
Yeah?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.061
Wait a minute.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.560
I think I can make a
really great sandwich

14:33.072 --> 14:36.075
out of all of my leftover chutneys.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.977
Frasier, you have got
to snap out of this.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.378
You start seeing patients soon.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.881
You realiZe you're only
using food to fill a void...

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
Oh! I forgot to void that
check to the dry cleaner.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.384
I got my camel coat home.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.113
It had a spot the siZe of a Krugerrand.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.054
I know for a fact it
was not there when...

14:49.054 --> 14:50.356
Niles.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.358
Sorry.

14:52.358 --> 14:54.326
What are you doing with Dad's velveeta?

14:54.326 --> 14:57.062
t. What do you think I'm doing
with it?I'm going to eat i

14:57.062 --> 14:59.997
Okay, Frasier, this isn't funny anymore.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.301
Oh, my God.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.969
What is it?

15:03.969 --> 15:05.937
It's viagra.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.505
They give that away with velveeta?

15:14.346 --> 15:17.049
No.

15:17.049 --> 15:20.052
It's a prescription for Martin crane.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.354
Why do you suppose he
would put it in here?

15:22.354 --> 15:24.056
Hiding it, I assume.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.353
What better place than a box

15:26.058 --> 15:28.193
that Pandora herself
would be loath to open.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.125
(door opening)

15:29.428 --> 15:30.429
It's Dad!

15:30.429 --> 15:32.420
Oh! Oh! Oh!

15:34.633 --> 15:35.634
(both sputtering)

15:35.634 --> 15:36.635
Put it away!

15:36.635 --> 15:37.636
Right, right.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.104
(muffled yell)

15:44.610 --> 15:47.112
Dad, what are you doing back so soon?

15:47.112 --> 15:50.104
I forgot something.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.107
My, um... brella.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.221
Well, you're certainly not
going to find it in the kitchen.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.711
No, I guess not.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.366
Oh, I just
remembered--

16:07.366 --> 16:09.068
Ronee wanted me to get her an appetiZer.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.057
What looks good?

16:10.369 --> 16:13.072
Oh, velvetta. That goes with anything.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.373
All right, well...

16:14.373 --> 16:17.376
You boys have got your
opera that you want to watch,

16:17.376 --> 16:19.071
so I'll just get out of your way.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.367
See you later.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.083
Now what?

16:24.083 --> 16:25.384
Okay, okay...

16:25.384 --> 16:27.086
We've got time to think.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.077
It's going to take him a while
to discover that the pills...

16:37.396 --> 16:38.727
All right, where is it?

16:39.064 --> 16:40.395
Frasier took them.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.402
Dad...

16:43.402 --> 16:44.767
This is pretty funny to you, huh?

16:45.204 --> 16:46.672
No, sir. Then what is it?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.140
You're still so sore about Ronee,

16:48.140 --> 16:49.541
you're trying to mess things up for me?

16:49.541 --> 16:51.043
No, Dad, I found them by accident.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.544
I tried to put them back.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.046
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

16:54.046 --> 16:54.535
Here.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.048
Oh, forget it.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.549
I'm just going to cancel with Ronee.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.051
Dad...

16:59.051 --> 17:01.086
No, the whole night's ruined anyway.

17:01.086 --> 17:04.423
But the important thing is
you boys had your little laugh.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.258
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it,

17:06.258 --> 17:08.260
because I'm starting to think

17:08.260 --> 17:09.249
that it's just too much trouble.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.751
I'm just going to break it off.

17:12.263 --> 17:14.767
Why would you do that, Dad?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.759
I mean, you're not going
to let what happened tonight

17:18.270 --> 17:20.271
end things with Ronee, are you?

17:20.271 --> 17:22.262
Is there something else going on here?

17:26.145 --> 17:27.635
.. Well, I don't know. I.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.143
Ronee and I have been getting
kind of close this week, and...

17:34.453 --> 17:36.155
Last night we started fooling around

17:36.155 --> 17:38.457
and it was great.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.826
I mean, I was rounding the bases.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.828
The coach was waving me in.

17:42.828 --> 17:46.331
There wasn't even going to
be a play at the plate...

17:46.331 --> 17:49.201
Dad, it's us.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.469
Oh, right.

17:50.469 --> 17:54.462
.. Well, anyway, that's
when something happened.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.835
. or didn't happen..

17:57.242 --> 18:02.147
which has never not
happened before. So...

18:02.147 --> 18:05.584
I decided today to go out to get some...

18:05.584 --> 18:07.279
cheese.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.357
I just couldn't stop picturing
her the way she looked

18:12.357 --> 18:13.859
when she was a teenager.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.360
It was creepy.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.863
And even with...

18:17.863 --> 18:19.765
cheese,

18:19.765 --> 18:24.532
I don't think I'd ever
feel about being with her.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.329
Dad, when she was baby-sitting for us,

18:28.841 --> 18:30.476
did you ever notice her?

18:30.476 --> 18:32.144
 Yeah, she was a very pretty girl.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.179
And did Mom ever notice you noticing ?

18:34.179 --> 18:35.168
Oh, yeah.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.171
Even had a fight once about it.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.317
Well, there you are.

18:38.317 --> 18:40.552
You're still feeling guilt and shame

18:40.552 --> 18:42.554
for being attracted to
her all those years ago.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.148
But she's an adult now,

18:45.357 --> 18:46.325
and you really should allow yourself

18:46.325 --> 18:47.693
 to explore these feelings.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.696
very good, Frasier.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.698
Thank you, Niles.

18:52.698 --> 18:55.634
You know...

18:55.634 --> 18:58.330
perhaps my depression over losing Ronee

18:58.637 --> 19:02.641
was actually rooted in my feelings
for her from long ago as well.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.310
After all, she's the first
woman to reject me,

19:05.310 --> 19:06.645
though she never knew it.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.148
I...

19:09.148 --> 19:12.351
Perhaps by pursuing her again,

19:12.351 --> 19:15.514
I was hoping to undo
that first rejection,

19:16.188 --> 19:19.282
thereby erasing all the
subsequent rejections in my life

19:19.591 --> 19:22.594
and giving myself a much
needed shot of self-esteem.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.425
Did you hear that?!

19:26.431 --> 19:29.434
My analytical skills are on fire!

19:29.434 --> 19:33.338
Your own-horn-tooting skills
haven't abandoned you either.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.440
So much for worrying about
whether I'm ready to get back

19:35.440 --> 19:36.942
into private practice.

19:36.942 --> 19:37.442
The answer is a resounding yes.

19:37.442 --> 19:38.932
Well, you better be sure

19:39.244 --> 19:40.802
because it's a completely
different animal, and...

19:41.346 --> 19:42.848
I just remembered the Zoo'
s having a fund-raiser.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.349
I signed you up for $200.
That's the safari level.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.751
You know who has malaria?

19:45.751 --> 19:46.852
FRASIER: Niles! Missus...

19:46.852 --> 19:48.854
Do you realiZe that
your babbling kicks in

19:48.854 --> 19:50.856
whenever I mention my
return to private practice?

19:50.856 --> 19:52.653
Perhaps this condition

19:53.025 --> 19:55.294
of yours has less to
do with baby jitters

19:55.294 --> 19:57.229
and more to do with my
entering your domain.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.220
My God!

19:59.731 --> 20:01.233
If I get any hotter,

20:01.233 --> 20:04.236
I'm going to set off the sprinklers!

20:04.236 --> 20:07.239
Oh, get over yourself!
Why shouldn't I be anxious?

20:07.239 --> 20:08.740
can't I ever have one
thin g that's just mine?

20:08.740 --> 20:12.077
Niles... It's like when I
discovered backgammon or fencing...

20:12.077 --> 20:14.580
Niles! Relax.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.950
It's okay.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.452
You are an excellent psychiatrist.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.386
I couldn't eclipse you if I tried.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.291
Thanks.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.280
You're sure?

20:29.394 --> 20:31.363
Yes.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.264
Splendid.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.265
And, Dad,

20:33.265 --> 20:35.467
you should go down and see Ronee.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.436
She must like you an awful lot...

20:38.770 --> 20:40.328
considering who she passed up.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.409
I don't know. I know it sounds craZy,

20:44.409 --> 20:46.468
but I just keep seeing
her in that ponytail

20:46.912 --> 20:48.846
and that parochial school uniform.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.383
Ronee didn't go to parochial school.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.385
She didn't?

20:53.385 --> 20:54.786
No, that was our
other baby-sitter-- Sally.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.482
Oh, right. Sally the slut.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.323
I liked her.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.796
You mean all this
time I've been thinking

21:04.796 --> 21:06.798
she was someone else?

21:06.798 --> 21:09.434
See ya.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.731
Dad, don't you want your cheese?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.437
No, thanks, boys,

21:12.437 --> 21:17.739
but I'm working without a net.
