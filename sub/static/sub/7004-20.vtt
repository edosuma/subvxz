WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:07.639
The guys are in range.
Gets it back to fedorov.
Can fedorov get a break?

00:07.640 --> 00:10.809
He shoots... He scores!

00:10.810 --> 00:15.847
Hey! No hockey in the house.

00:15.848 --> 00:20.451
Oh, guys. Do you remember
this morning when you said
to me:

00:20.452 --> 00:24.188
"we love you and we'll have
the house cleaned up by
the time you get home"?

00:24.189 --> 00:26.825
No.

00:26.826 --> 00:29.928
Will you get your jackets
and your backpacks off
the table?

00:29.929 --> 00:32.130
Which one of you pigs
left this mess?

00:32.131 --> 00:33.999
The pig with
the tool belt.

00:37.469 --> 00:40.571
Well, tell your dad
to clear all that off
and set the table.

00:40.572 --> 00:43.642
Dinner is in
those bags right there.
Oh, what'd you get?

00:43.643 --> 00:47.145
Chicken. Don't touch it
until dinnertime tonight.

00:47.146 --> 00:53.484
Gosh, I live with a bunch
of animals - disgusting,
filthy little animals.

00:53.485 --> 00:57.321
Hey, dad, be real careful.
Mom just got home
and she's in a bad mood.

00:57.322 --> 01:01.893
Great. She walks in the door
and you tick her off?
Can't you help her out, huh?

01:01.894 --> 01:06.097
Hey, she's not mad at us.
She's mad at you for leaving
the mess on the counter.

01:06.098 --> 01:09.400
What am I? A janitor?

01:09.401 --> 01:11.736
<i>(jill)</i> tim!
Uh...

01:11.737 --> 01:14.839
I'm cleaning up
right now, honey!

01:14.840 --> 01:20.545
<i>(jill)</i> tim, I'm way behind.
I've got to study tonight.

01:20.546 --> 01:23.114
Hey, don't you worry
about a thing, honey.

01:23.115 --> 01:26.151
I'll keep the boys
out of your hair.

01:30.189 --> 01:33.558
<i>(jill)</i> oh, I brought dinner.
Will you set it out for me?

01:33.559 --> 01:36.728
I sure will.
Where'd you set it out?

01:36.729 --> 01:39.664
<i>(jill)</i> it's on the counter
by the trash compactor.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.371
Not anymore.

02:36.789 --> 02:40.324
I've never studied for anything
so hard in my life.

02:40.325 --> 02:42.894
But it will be worth it.

02:42.895 --> 02:48.166
If I do well, I should get into
any graduate school around here,
maybe even u of m.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.268
Great.

02:50.269 --> 02:53.571
Jill, why do you leave
your wedding ring here
by the sink?

02:53.572 --> 02:56.607
I took it off when I was
washing the pots and pans.

02:56.608 --> 02:58.009
This is not a good place
to leave it.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.611
It could go down the drain.
I'd never find it.

03:00.612 --> 03:03.314
Always leave it over here
where it's safe, ok?
<i>(clattering)</i>

03:10.489 --> 03:12.757
Oh, no.

03:15.427 --> 03:19.363
<i>(jill)</i> what did you do?
Nothing.

03:19.364 --> 03:21.565
What was that noise?

03:21.566 --> 03:25.436
I don't know, but it had
a familiar ring to it,
didn't it?

03:25.437 --> 03:29.540
Did you drop my ring
down the drain?
No, I did not.

03:29.541 --> 03:32.243
I dropped it down
the furnace vent.

03:32.244 --> 03:34.745
Oh, no.
I want my wedding ring back.

03:34.746 --> 03:38.016
Ok, relax. I'll get some tools.
I'll get it out of there.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.984
It'll give me a chance to find
those earrings I dropped down
there

03:39.985 --> 03:43.587
That I just realized
I didn't tell you about.

03:43.588 --> 03:45.890
Tim, what is going on
with you?

03:45.891 --> 03:49.627
First you flatten the dinner,
you forget to empty
the dishwasher,

03:49.628 --> 03:52.763
You didn't separate the laundry
like I asked you to.

03:52.764 --> 03:56.334
I was driving mark
to his computer class.
No, no, no.

03:56.335 --> 04:00.004
There's something else.
I've been sensing some
hostility from you.

04:00.005 --> 04:03.041
No more than usual.

04:05.211 --> 04:08.646
I thought that we had
an open relationship,

04:08.647 --> 04:12.183
That we could talk about
anything. Talk to me.

04:12.184 --> 04:14.452
I don't want to.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.824
Something is bothering you
and you're just avoiding it.

04:19.825 --> 04:22.060
We shouldn't have
any unresolved issues.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.762
If you must know, since you've
been doing this test here,

04:24.763 --> 04:30.401
I've been doing a lot of extra
work, and I'm beginning to feel
taken for granted.

04:32.604 --> 04:36.607
Taken for granted?
I know you're not
doing it on purpose,

04:36.608 --> 04:39.677
But you've been
pretty insensitive.

04:42.314 --> 04:44.182
Pretty insensitive?

04:44.183 --> 04:47.551
You know, a little thank you
would go a long way.

04:47.552 --> 04:50.554
A little thank you?

04:50.555 --> 04:53.958
You know, it really scares me
when you repeat everything
I say.

04:53.959 --> 04:59.764
I cannot believe that you have
the gall to say that I am taking
you for granted.

04:59.765 --> 05:01.766
Here it goes.

05:01.767 --> 05:07.238
For the last 15 years I've been
doing all the thankless jobs -
laundry, cooking, cleaning,

05:07.239 --> 05:10.108
And in my spare time
I've managed to have
three children.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.842
You never once thanked me.

05:11.843 --> 05:15.947
The one time that I come to you
asking you to carry your weight
around here,

05:15.948 --> 05:17.949
All I get from you
is resentment.

05:17.950 --> 05:22.820
The truth is you were happier
when I was stuck in the kitchen
barefoot and pregnant.

05:22.821 --> 05:28.793
I should just squat
down here right now
and shoot out another kid.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.933
Just don't do it
near the furnace vent.

05:37.102 --> 05:41.205
Our objective is to put
our two pieces of wood together

05:41.206 --> 05:44.175
So it has a secure
and perfect union.

05:44.176 --> 05:46.144
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.279
That's right.
In this case...

05:48.280 --> 05:52.350
Like there's such a thing
as a perfect union. Come on.
What century are you living in?

05:52.351 --> 05:54.518
What happens...
I want to get something
off my chest.

05:54.519 --> 05:57.188
Tim.
Leave me alone!

05:57.189 --> 06:01.659
Hey, guys, I'm cheesed.
Has this ever happened to you?

06:01.660 --> 06:06.897
You're minding your own
business, picking your meal
out of the trash compactor,

06:06.898 --> 06:10.368
When out of the henhouse,
the big old hen starts clucking:

06:10.369 --> 06:14.572
<i>(high-pitched voice)</i> "we got
some unresolved issues."

06:14.573 --> 06:17.175
Don't ever fall for this
"they want to talk,"

06:17.176 --> 06:20.311
They want you to say something
to get yourself in trouble.

06:20.312 --> 06:22.780
I hear you, tool man.
You know what
I'm talking about?

06:22.781 --> 06:26.584
We're constantly in trouble.
No matter what we say,
we're in trouble.

06:26.585 --> 06:28.853
Two bachelors in trouble. Hm.

06:28.854 --> 06:32.857
Should we get 'em down here
and see if we can help them?
Bring them on down.

06:35.327 --> 06:38.496
Come on, guys.
Who do we have here?

06:38.497 --> 06:40.164
Jim.
Hi, jim.

06:40.165 --> 06:42.367
Dave.
Sit down.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

06:42.368 --> 06:45.069
All right, what we're gonna
have is like a...

06:45.070 --> 06:48.572
<i>Tool time</i> seminar on how
to talk to your ladies.

06:48.573 --> 06:52.110
All right. Which one
of your girlfriends
talks the most?

06:52.111 --> 06:54.512
That's mine.
No way.
Mine, without a doubt.

06:54.513 --> 06:56.680
Phyllis is always
talking up a storm.

06:56.681 --> 06:58.816
Hurricane lorraine?
Need I say more?

06:58.817 --> 07:01.285
Phyllis throws shoes.
I've seen worse...

07:01.286 --> 07:03.154
Guys, could we?

07:04.923 --> 07:07.691
Ok. My wife is studying
to be a psychologist.

07:07.692 --> 07:11.729
They do something called
role-playing, to learn about
the other person's position.

07:11.730 --> 07:15.733
We need somebody to play
the role of lorraine.

07:19.771 --> 07:21.972
Al, you have a very strong
feminine side.

07:21.973 --> 07:24.142
Would you be lorraine
for this experiment?

07:24.143 --> 07:27.045
Only if lorraine gets to
finish the cabinet doors.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.613
Ok, dave, you're it.

07:29.614 --> 07:31.215
What if lorraine
is watching this?

07:31.216 --> 07:33.784
Are you kidding me?
She wouldn't watch <i>tool time.</i>

07:33.785 --> 07:37.455
She hates tim.
Oh, yeah.

07:37.456 --> 07:40.491
Obviously a woman with taste.

07:40.492 --> 07:43.994
Can we begin? Ok.
Dave, you're gonna be lorraine.

07:43.995 --> 07:48.499
I want you to tell everybody
what lorraine says to jim
to get him in trouble.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.701
All right, all right,
I know this one.

07:50.702 --> 07:54.872
Jim, you said you were
gonna be home last night,

07:54.873 --> 07:58.342
But I came by your house
and you weren't there.
Where were you?

07:58.343 --> 08:01.279
Where was I?
<i>(horn)</i>

08:01.280 --> 08:07.651
<i>Tool time</i> tip. Women always
know men are lying when they
repeat the question.

08:07.652 --> 08:09.420
Oh. All right.

08:09.421 --> 08:11.822
Come on, sweetheart.
Turn up the heat.

08:14.226 --> 08:16.427
Why didn't you call?
I was busy.

08:16.428 --> 08:19.097
Too busy to call?
You know,
I was thinking of you.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.332
What were you thinking?
I was thinking
of calling you.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.367
No, you weren't.
Yes, I was.

08:23.368 --> 08:24.435
No, you weren't!
Yes, I was!

08:24.436 --> 08:26.137
Are you lying to me?
Am I lying to you?

08:26.138 --> 08:27.671
<i>(horn honks)</i>

08:27.672 --> 08:30.108
Jimmy, jimmy, jimmy.

08:30.109 --> 08:34.078
'fraid lorraine's got
your biscuits in a vise, buddy.

08:34.078 --> 08:38.048
Now, wait a minute.
I want to know why
he didn't call me.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.551
Dave, I think
the role-playing's over.

08:40.552 --> 08:42.019
Oh.

08:47.692 --> 08:53.964
Makes my point. Women,
or guys playing women,
tend to confuse us.

08:53.965 --> 08:57.268
Tim, what about when lorraine
talks to me about commitment?

08:57.269 --> 09:00.338
I love her, but I don't know
about marriage. I'm not ready.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.273
Excuse me, jim,

09:02.274 --> 09:04.842
Lorraine would understand
if you explained to her

09:04.843 --> 09:08.312
That marriage is the first step
of a sacred journey,

09:08.313 --> 09:11.616
And something that important
cannot be put on the fast track.

09:20.692 --> 09:23.327
Well, let's put
that to a vote.

09:23.328 --> 09:25.563
How many think
al gave jim good advice

09:25.564 --> 09:28.132
Or put jim on the fast track
to a quick head injury?

09:28.133 --> 09:29.700
<i>(all)</i> head injury.

09:29.701 --> 09:32.270
Oh, come on. Not all women
are trying to trap men.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.705
Trap, snare, snag.

09:34.706 --> 09:39.644
A woman has to be married,
otherwise she'd be home
nagging herself. <i>(laughs)</i>

09:39.645 --> 09:44.048
If you ladies would like
to contact tim directly,
that's 555-tool.

09:44.049 --> 09:47.251
Operators are standing by.

09:47.252 --> 09:49.987
I think I see the ring...

09:49.988 --> 09:53.457
And a lot of that broccoli
brad says he's been eating.

09:55.394 --> 10:00.097
Go upstairs, take a tennis ball
and drop it down, see if you can
dislodge that thing.

10:00.098 --> 10:01.799
Ok.
All right.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.669
Yzerman almost goes into
the bench, but he doesn't.

10:04.670 --> 10:07.572
Flips it up to fedorov.
Uh-oh, mom's home!

10:07.573 --> 10:09.574
Cleanup mode.

10:12.777 --> 10:16.214
Hey, mom.
How was your day?

10:16.215 --> 10:19.217
It was fine until
I went into the student lounge

10:19.218 --> 10:22.220
And saw a bunch of people
watching <i>tool time.</i>

10:22.221 --> 10:26.023
You didn't notice the part
where dad called you an old hen,
now, did you?

10:26.024 --> 10:29.327
Yes, I did.

10:29.328 --> 10:33.598
I guess that would
make dad a dead duck.

10:33.599 --> 10:36.400
Hi, mom. Hi, guys.
Hi. What are you doing?

10:36.401 --> 10:40.871
Dad's in the basement waiting
for me to drop this tennis ball
down the vent.

10:40.872 --> 10:44.275
He thinks it will knock
the ring loose.
All right. I'm ready.

10:44.276 --> 10:47.211
Please, allow me.

10:47.212 --> 10:49.213
<i>(tim)</i> come on,
let me have it!

10:51.816 --> 10:54.852
<i>(clattering)</i>

10:54.853 --> 10:58.055
<i>(thud)</i>
ow!

10:58.056 --> 11:01.425
I said a tennis ball,
not a croquet ball!

11:01.426 --> 11:03.961
It wasn't me.
Who was it?

11:03.962 --> 11:06.797
The old hen.

11:07.966 --> 11:10.801
Hi, henny.
I mean, honey.

11:13.838 --> 11:16.607
I suppose you... Oh.

11:16.608 --> 11:20.144
I suppose you saw
the show today.

11:20.145 --> 11:24.248
You are so pathetic. Why is it
that I have to drag everything
out of you at home,

11:24.249 --> 11:26.684
But you're willing to go
blab about your feelings

11:26.685 --> 11:29.052
In front of a bunch of
strangers on <i>tool time?</i>

11:29.053 --> 11:32.690
Well, because on <i>tool time</i>
I can say whatever I want...

11:32.691 --> 11:36.994
And people don't hit me in
the head with croquet balls.

11:36.995 --> 11:38.396
Jill!

11:42.801 --> 11:45.803
<i>(clattering)</i>

11:45.804 --> 11:48.105
<i>(thud)</i>
ow!

11:51.944 --> 11:54.445
Hike.

11:54.446 --> 11:56.414
Come on, guys.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.316
You're supposed to be cleaning
the house, aren't you?

11:58.317 --> 12:03.053
Sorry, dad. I mean, if us
out here is bothering you,
just say something.

12:03.054 --> 12:05.656
Why do we have to
drag it out of you?

12:08.327 --> 12:12.797
How can you share things
with strangers on <i>tool time,</i>
but not with your own sons?

12:14.499 --> 12:17.501
I feel like sharing my feelings
right now with both of you.

12:19.037 --> 12:21.972
I got him, brad.
<i>(tim)</i> hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

12:24.209 --> 12:26.877
Hey, dad, go deep.

<i>(harmonica plays)</i>

12:33.918 --> 12:35.986

12:35.987 --> 12:37.955
<i>(wilson)</i> hi-ho, neighbor.

12:37.956 --> 12:42.426
You know, tim, I woke up
this morning and the blues
were all around my bed.

12:44.596 --> 12:47.665
Maybe you should
have tried vacuuming.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.568
Well, I got hit
with a croquet ball.

12:50.569 --> 12:52.870
I got the black-and-blues.

12:59.444 --> 13:03.581
♪ got out of my bed

13:06.351 --> 13:09.987
♪ got hit in the head

13:13.258 --> 13:16.727
♪ knocked out of my shoes

13:19.498 --> 13:25.235
♪ I got those lowdown
croquet-ball blues

13:38.917 --> 13:41.285
When did you learn how
to play the harmonica?

13:41.286 --> 13:42.920
This morning.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.626
Can I ask you a question?
Bring it on home, tim.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.729
You know what gives me
the blues? Women.

13:51.730 --> 13:56.099
Jill in particular.
She likes to talk
everything to death.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.369
And she wants to know
what I feel, how I feel,
when I feel it.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.705
Nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

14:01.706 --> 14:05.476
Well, tim,
is it nagging or is jill
searching for intimacy?

14:06.545 --> 14:09.279
Nagging.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.415
I had a problem.
Not a big one,

14:11.416 --> 14:12.783
I just didn't want
to let her know.

14:12.784 --> 14:14.552
She dragged it out of me,
and when I told her what it was,

14:14.553 --> 14:17.555
She jumps down my throat,
totally overreacted.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.390
Well, maybe jill's got
a touch of the blues herself.

14:20.391 --> 14:23.594
Why would she
have the blues?
Oh, tim, I don't know.

14:23.595 --> 14:27.364
I just know that mahalia
jackson, the great singer,
said having the blues

14:27.365 --> 14:30.000
Is like being in a deep pit
yelling for help.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.837
So when she's
yelling at me,

14:32.838 --> 14:35.005
Maybe she's just
crying out for help?

14:35.006 --> 14:37.908
Well, there's only one way
to find out, tim. Talk to her.

14:37.909 --> 14:40.845
<i>(grunting)</i> no more talk.
I am not talking anymore.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.547

Tim.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.945
Al, you're not still angry
because we didn't finish
that cabinet door, are you?

15:53.084 --> 15:55.452
Albert.

15:55.453 --> 15:58.088
It's not good to have
any unresolved issues.

15:58.089 --> 16:01.992
As a matter of fact, yes,
I was looking forward
to that segment.

16:01.993 --> 16:06.163
I told some cabinetmaker
friends of mine about it.
They were very disappointed.

16:06.164 --> 16:09.166
I hope they didn't
come unhinged.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.903
About 30 seconds, guys.
<i>(tim)</i> thanks, heidi.

16:12.904 --> 16:15.039
Tim? Tim!

16:15.040 --> 16:17.074
Why are you guys
doing here?
We gotta talk.

16:17.075 --> 16:18.776
I'm ready to do the show.
Wait a minute.

16:18.777 --> 16:21.244
Our girlfriends saw the show.
You gotta help us.

16:21.245 --> 16:23.614
We are in big trouble.
How big a trouble?

16:23.615 --> 16:26.617
You said your girlfriend
didn't watch it,
that she hated me.

16:26.618 --> 16:30.754
Her mother taped it.
Yeah, she loves al.

16:30.755 --> 16:34.558
What do you want me to do?
Go out and tell them
it's all your fault.

16:34.559 --> 16:37.527
Jim, dave, you wanna help out?
We'll do it together.

16:37.528 --> 16:42.600
Oh, no, no.
No! I'm not going out there
with you. You're dangerous.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.636
Now you know how I feel.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.905
<i>(applause)</i>

16:47.906 --> 16:49.607

16:49.608 --> 16:52.109
Oh. Thank you, heidi.

16:52.110 --> 16:54.411
Oh, you're too kind.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

16:54.412 --> 16:57.047
I am tim

17:05.323 --> 17:08.992
Well, on yesterday's show
I might have gone a little
overboard.

17:08.993 --> 17:13.597
We got a few calls
from female viewers.
398.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.232
Who's counting?

17:15.233 --> 17:17.134
Me.

17:17.135 --> 17:20.237
<i>(tim)</i> you'll all
remember the two bachelors.

17:20.238 --> 17:23.272
Apparently I got them
in a little hot water
with their girlfriends.

17:23.273 --> 17:25.876
I intend to fix
that right now.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.978
Tim.
Marv, you want to
follow me back here?

17:27.979 --> 17:30.280
Tim. Ti...

17:30.281 --> 17:33.250
Got a minute, marv?
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.

17:33.251 --> 17:35.085
<i>(jim)</i> what are you doing?

17:35.086 --> 17:37.254
Boys, a chance to make it up
to your girlfriends.

17:37.255 --> 17:39.156
What are you doing?
No, no. Get the camera away.

17:39.157 --> 17:42.225
You've gotta do this.
To have a good relationship,
you gotta talk about it.

17:42.226 --> 17:45.395
Dave, come here. Want to say
something to phyllis?

17:45.396 --> 17:47.064
I guess so.

17:47.065 --> 17:49.432
Hi, phyllis.

17:49.433 --> 17:53.236
I want to state publicly
that I'm sorry for anything
that I might have said,

17:53.237 --> 17:57.641
Or will ever say
in the future.
All right.

17:57.642 --> 18:01.745
And most importantly...
Phyl, listen to this.

18:01.746 --> 18:06.150
...I'll never listen
to tim again.

18:06.151 --> 18:09.586
The only <i>tool time</i> tip
you'll ever need.

18:12.557 --> 18:15.059
You want to say something to
phyllis? Excuse me - lorraine.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.094
Yeah.
Ok.

18:17.095 --> 18:21.765
Lorraine, remember at
the restaurant yesterday
we talked about getting married,

18:21.766 --> 18:23.600
And you looked deep
in my eyes and you said:

18:23.601 --> 18:27.137
"pick a date,
you pig, or die"?

18:27.138 --> 18:30.007
Well, I thought about it.

18:30.008 --> 18:31.709
May 28.

18:31.710 --> 18:35.746
That's the indy 500 weekend.
June 4.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.152
Congratulations, lorraine.

18:42.153 --> 18:44.888
But to show I'm serious,

18:44.889 --> 18:47.091
I got a ring.
<i>(whistles)</i>

18:47.092 --> 18:50.094
That's a beauty.
Can I see that?
Sure.

18:50.095 --> 18:53.396
Hey, marv, if you can focus
on this, come on in close.

18:53.397 --> 18:55.799
Look at the size
of that thing, huh?

18:58.103 --> 19:01.071
You know, I have never
seen that drain before.

19:12.416 --> 19:14.852
Hi.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.653
Hi.

19:16.654 --> 19:19.056
I want to show you
something.
What?

19:19.057 --> 19:21.058
Come here.

19:24.528 --> 19:29.432
I made a scale model of
the office I'll build you
when you become a psychologist.

19:29.433 --> 19:33.237
Here's your desk,
here's your chair,
and here's your nut.

19:40.745 --> 19:44.347
Where am I?
Seated at the desk.

19:44.348 --> 19:46.716
And why did you do this?

19:46.717 --> 19:48.485
I thought it would
cheer you up.

19:48.486 --> 19:50.854
I think you might have the blues
and maybe we should talk.

19:50.855 --> 19:52.956
So you're saying
you want to talk?

19:52.957 --> 19:55.659
Why do you think
I'm laying down?

19:57.862 --> 19:59.763
The other day,
when you asked me
what I was feeling,

19:59.764 --> 20:04.634
I told you, and you
jumped down my throat.

20:08.306 --> 20:11.175
You're right.
It wasn't fair.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.243
If I'm going to ask
for your feelings,

20:13.244 --> 20:16.746
Then I should be able to accept
them no matter what they are.

20:16.747 --> 20:20.250
And not hit me
in the head with
a croquet ball.

20:22.053 --> 20:24.587
Sorry about that. <i>(kiss)</i>

20:26.424 --> 20:31.328
I'm not sure you should
kiss your patients
in that part of the peanut.

20:42.841 --> 20:45.809
But I also should learn
to listen to your feelings

20:45.810 --> 20:47.577
And understand
what you're going through.

20:47.578 --> 20:50.413
You helped me when I changed
careers into <i>tool time.</i>

20:50.414 --> 20:52.782
And I want to do
the same for you,

20:52.783 --> 20:55.953
'cause, with your talent,
you might have your own show.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.822
Your own psychology show -
can you imagine?

20:58.823 --> 21:01.892
"is everyone cognizant
of what time it's become?"

21:05.730 --> 21:08.966
"it's psycho time."

21:12.636 --> 21:14.637
Tim!
Right here.

21:14.638 --> 21:16.206
Guess what.

21:16.207 --> 21:20.643
I think, I hope,
I did great on the test.
Congratulations.

21:20.644 --> 21:24.314
Yeah, if I had to guess,
I think I might be in
the 90th percentile.

21:24.315 --> 21:27.184
Out of how many?

21:27.185 --> 21:29.219
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:29.220 --> 21:32.022
I figured out a way
to get your ring back.
What?

21:32.023 --> 21:35.859
I taped up all the vents
in the house, except
the one in the kitchen.

21:35.860 --> 21:39.462
I installed a binford 6100
super compressor on the furnace.

21:39.463 --> 21:41.698
I'm gonna blow that thing
right out of here.

21:41.699 --> 21:43.800
So just stand back here
for protection.

21:43.801 --> 21:46.236
Countdown to ring-out.

21:46.237 --> 21:48.238
Three, two, one.

21:56.514 --> 21:59.682
Is it my ring?

21:59.683 --> 22:02.953
I think...

22:02.954 --> 22:04.955
I don't believe it!

22:04.956 --> 22:08.025
Is it ok?
Let's take a look at it.

22:09.627 --> 22:12.629
Perfect.
It's even cleaner now.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.899
Your inscription's
all worn off.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.236
"I will never love...
An otter."

22:22.640 --> 22:26.376
"another."
"I will never love another."
huh.

22:26.377 --> 22:28.578
And to think all these years
I've been avoiding otters.

22:32.683 --> 22:35.452
Make sure the joint
on your door is secure.

22:35.453 --> 22:39.889
And for that, we're using a
biscuit joiner to cut the slots
in our wood for the biscuits.

22:39.890 --> 22:41.791
Biscuits?
Do you think they...

22:41.792 --> 22:43.526
No. They're not
buttermilk biscuits.

22:43.527 --> 22:45.262
They're not
sourdough biscuits.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.630
They're not dog biscuits.

22:47.631 --> 22:48.731
They're not
biscuits with honey,

22:48.732 --> 22:51.201
Not biscuits with gravy,
not biscuits in a box

22:51.202 --> 22:53.503
Or biscuits in a basket!

22:54.939 --> 22:57.507
You're a biscuit case, al.
