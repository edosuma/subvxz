00:32.543 --> 00:35.469
MALORY: Woodhouse?
WOODHOUSE: Mum.

00:35.589 --> 00:38.874
MALORY: If I see this glass
empty again, I will be very

00:38.876 --> 00:41.159
unhappy.
WOODHOUSE: Perish the

00:41.161 --> 00:45.297
thought, mum.
MALORY: Now, then.

00:45.299 --> 00:50.685
Who'd like to go first?
(Cyril coughs)

00:50.687 --> 00:54.773
No?
All right, then I will.

00:54.775 --> 00:58.510
Idiots!
(both yelling)

00:58.512 --> 01:00.779
Thank you, dear.
For a moment there, I thought

01:00.781 --> 01:05.784
I was going to be unhappy.
Now, then.

01:05.786 --> 01:08.286
Who's next?

01:47.710 --> 01:51.418
ARCHER: Okay, so, uh...
I guess I'll go if...

01:51.538 --> 01:53.941
MALORY: If I can just stop
you there.

01:53.943 --> 01:57.028
Will you please cover yourself?!
CHERLENE: With what?

01:57.030 --> 02:00.164
I don't have any...
(spraying)

02:00.166 --> 02:02.483
There. Happy?
MALORY: No!

02:02.485 --> 02:04.485
I didn't mean with whipped
cream!

02:04.487 --> 02:06.487
PAM: It's actually whipped
cocaine, so...

02:06.489 --> 02:08.489
(Malory groans)
MALORY: That explains where

02:08.491 --> 02:10.991
some of it went.
CHERLENE: Mmm, and the tingly

02:10.993 --> 02:13.494
numbness of my nipples.
MALORY: And why are you

02:13.496 --> 02:16.097
dressed like the whore the rest
of the trailer park finally

02:16.099 --> 02:18.266
decided they had to stone to
death?

02:18.268 --> 02:21.001
CHERLENE: Duh, we were
shooting my album cover.

02:21.003 --> 02:24.672
KRIEGER: Yes!
Good, yes, that is perfect!

02:24.674 --> 02:27.275
PAM: Perfect for what?
Come on, it's an album cover,

02:27.277 --> 02:32.346
not a... Amish Bible!
PAM: You got to sex that shit

02:32.348 --> 02:34.365
up sexy.
KRIEGER: Um...

02:34.367 --> 02:36.400
CHERLENE: I think it's pretty
sexy.

02:36.402 --> 02:39.203
PAM: You think that's sexy?
With the rocket pops...

02:39.205 --> 02:42.073
outside of you.
CHERLENE: I mean...

02:42.075 --> 02:44.525
KRIEGER: But if she eats
them, we lose the whole red,

02:44.527 --> 02:47.194
white and... okay...
PAM: Yeah, not talking about

02:47.196 --> 02:49.463
eating them.
CHERLENE: Wait, what are

02:49.465 --> 02:53.167
you... You want me to put a
rocket pop in my vagina?!

02:53.169 --> 02:56.671
PAM: Well, for starters.
But let's not rule anything out.

02:56.673 --> 02:58.706
You know? Let's kind of see
where that leads.

02:58.708 --> 03:01.259
We've got a shitload of film.
KRIEGER: I'm supposed to have

03:01.261 --> 03:03.261
film in this?
CHERLENE: Goddamn it!

03:03.263 --> 03:05.713
PAM: Krieger!
LANA: So, I have a question.

03:05.715 --> 03:07.715
PAM: The butthole, Lana, is
what I was...

03:07.717 --> 03:10.067
LANA: Yeah, I got that.
But do you think the cover for a

03:10.069 --> 03:13.053
country album should be
hardcore...?

03:13.055 --> 03:15.690
What do you even call that?
Food porn?

03:15.692 --> 03:18.359
PAM: I do.
LANA: You think it makes a

03:18.361 --> 03:21.078
good country album cover
or you call it food porn?

03:21.080 --> 03:23.080
PAM: Yes.
LANA: Are you...?

03:23.082 --> 03:25.082
(Cherlene squealing)
CHERLENE: These things are

03:25.084 --> 03:27.084
freezing!
KRIEGER: Film, film, film,

03:27.086 --> 03:29.086
film, film!
LANA: Quit putting rocket

03:29.088 --> 03:33.073
pops in your ass!
CHERLENE: I'm eating them.

03:33.075 --> 03:36.344
Jesus, what is wrong with you?
LANA: I guess I just don't

03:36.346 --> 03:38.462
get art.
PAM: You obviously don't.

03:38.464 --> 03:40.548
And it's not that we don't
appreciate criticism.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.550
It just needs to be
constructive.

03:42.552 --> 03:44.552
ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.
MALORY: Shut up.

03:44.554 --> 03:46.721
And then tell me what happened
to the hundred pounds of...

03:46.723 --> 03:48.723
BOTH: Kilos.
MALORY: Kilos, thank you,

03:48.725 --> 03:50.725
shut up.
Of cocaine that you took to

03:50.727 --> 03:52.777
Colombia.
LANA: Which...

03:52.779 --> 03:55.095
MALORY: Lana, when I want you
to talk, I will tell you, and

03:55.097 --> 03:57.448
until then, zip it!
LANA: Wha...? What did I do?

03:57.450 --> 03:59.450
MALORY: Nothing!
ARCHER: Yeah, Lana.

03:59.452 --> 04:01.736
MALORY: Which is why these
feckless idiots lost 200 kilos

04:01.738 --> 04:05.706
of cocaine!
ARCHER: Yeah, La... Oh.

04:05.708 --> 04:09.160
Uh, okay, technically, but then
we stole a plane loaded with,

04:09.162 --> 04:13.297
like, twice as much cocaine!
MALORY: Is this the part

04:13.299 --> 04:16.116
where you tell me to look under
my seat?

04:16.118 --> 04:18.786
ARCHER: No, unfortunately we
ran into some...

04:18.788 --> 04:22.340
CYRIL: Assholishness.
(all yelling)

04:22.342 --> 04:26.677
RAY: Archer, I swear to God!
I will crash this plane right

04:26.679 --> 04:29.730
into the goddamn ocean!
ARCHER: I'll take my chances

04:29.732 --> 04:32.183
with the ocean!
The ocean isn't full of

04:32.185 --> 04:34.435
alligators!
And do not even think about it,

04:34.437 --> 04:36.520
Cyril!
CYRIL: Ray, what do I do?!

04:36.522 --> 04:38.572
RAY: Uh...
I guess hang on.

04:38.574 --> 04:40.574
(grunts)
ARCHER and CYRIL: Whoa!

04:40.576 --> 04:43.527
(both grunting)
RAY: Sorry, Cyril.

04:43.529 --> 04:45.529
ARCHER: Ow.
CYRIL: Oh, shut up.

04:45.531 --> 04:47.531
It's your own fault.
ARCHER: Debatable.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.533
CYRIL: No, it's...
ARCHER: Shut up.

04:49.535 --> 04:51.535
Come on, Ray, there has to be
somewhere to land besides the

04:51.537 --> 04:54.121
middle of the damn Everglades.
RAY: Well, not within fuel

04:54.123 --> 04:56.123
range, so...
ARCHER: And who's fault

04:56.125 --> 04:58.342
is that?
RAY: Isaac goddamn Newton!

04:58.344 --> 05:00.494
You see that airstrip?
The one that's circled?

05:00.496 --> 05:03.214
That's the only one in range,
and we've only, barely, got

05:03.216 --> 05:05.216
enough fuel to make it there,
so...

05:05.218 --> 05:07.385
ARCHER: But Miami's, like,
right over here.

05:07.387 --> 05:09.387
CYRIL: We can't land at a
real airport!

05:09.389 --> 05:11.389
Even if Ray had filed a flight
plan...

05:11.391 --> 05:13.691
ARCHER: Why <i>didn't</i> you file
a flight plan?!

05:13.693 --> 05:16.844
That's like Airplane Stuff 101.
CYRIL: Not when the airplane

05:16.846 --> 05:19.530
is stolen and crammed full of
guns and cocaine!

05:19.532 --> 05:21.615
ARCHER: Ah.
I will concede that point.

05:21.617 --> 05:23.617
RAY: Damn it.
ARCHER: What's up?

05:23.619 --> 05:25.619
CYRIL: What's going on?
RAY: Burning too much

05:25.621 --> 05:27.621
fuel-- we're heavy.
CYRIL: What do you mean,

05:27.623 --> 05:29.623
heavy?
ARCHER: You said we had

05:29.625 --> 05:31.625
enough fuel to...
RAY: I said barely!

05:31.627 --> 05:33.661
I bet the Colombians didn't
count on three passengers.

05:33.663 --> 05:35.663
CYRIL (sobbing): Oh, my God,
we're gonna crash!

05:35.665 --> 05:37.698
ARCHER: Cyril, do not panic.
Just get out.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.700
CYRIL: What?!
ARCHER: Do the right thing,

05:39.702 --> 05:42.219
Cyril.
You have nothing to live for.

05:42.221 --> 05:45.556
CYRIL: Get your hands off me.
ARCHER: Okay, relax. Jesus.

05:45.558 --> 05:47.558
Whatever happened to Team
Archer?

05:47.560 --> 05:49.877
CYRIL: Please tell me that
was never a real thing to you.

05:49.879 --> 05:51.879
ARCHER: Eh... I mean...
RAY: Hello?

05:51.881 --> 05:54.565
Time's a bit of a factor here!
ARCHER: Cyril, for the love

05:54.567 --> 05:56.817
of God, man, jump!
CYRIL: Just throw out the

05:56.819 --> 05:59.069
cocaine.
ARCHER: What?! No!

05:59.071 --> 06:01.105
I'm not telling Mother I lost
the original hundred pounds

06:01.107 --> 06:03.107
of...
CYRIL and RAY: Kilos!

06:03.109 --> 06:05.109
ARCHER: ...whatever unit of
measurement-- of cocaine!

06:05.111 --> 06:08.162
Plus, all <i>this</i> cocaine!
Do you have any idea how mad

06:08.164 --> 06:09.864
she'd be?
RAY: Well, the

06:09.866 --> 06:12.399
alternative is a belly-landing
in a swamp filled with

06:12.401 --> 06:14.401
alligators!
ARCHER: No. No, no, no. No.

06:14.403 --> 06:16.403
What if, um...
CYRIL: Archer!

06:16.405 --> 06:18.405
Alligators or your mother!
ARCHER: What's the

06:18.407 --> 06:20.407
difference?
They're both cold-blooded

06:20.409 --> 06:23.243
prehistoric monsters.
(Malory clears throat loudly)

06:23.245 --> 06:25.763
MALORY: Excuse me?
ARCHER: I meant the pain of

06:25.765 --> 06:29.517
disappointing you would...
bite... alligator... ish...

06:29.519 --> 06:31.519
ly.
MALORY: Uh-huh.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.521
ARCHER: Anyway, right about
then...

06:33.523 --> 06:35.523
RAY: Okay, I can see the
airstrip.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.525
CYRIL: Well, can we make it?
RAY: Maybe, if you...

06:37.527 --> 06:39.860
ARCHER: Wait! Ray, you said
the Colombians were flying to

06:39.862 --> 06:41.896
this airstrip?
RAY: Yes!

06:41.898 --> 06:44.482
Why do you think it's marked on
the chart, you idiot?

06:44.484 --> 06:46.734
ARCHER: Okay, well, let's
circle back to who's an idiot,

06:46.736 --> 06:49.904
and talk about who's probably
waiting <i>at</i> this airstrip.

06:49.906 --> 06:51.906
(Cyril gasps)
RAY: Dukes.

06:51.908 --> 06:54.208
ARCHER: <i>And</i> what their
reaction will be to three total

06:54.210 --> 06:58.879
strangers showing up in their
plane without their coke.

06:58.881 --> 07:01.165
CYRIL: They'll kill us!
RAY: Well... maybe not.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.384
ARCHER: Wait, why?
CYRIL: Why maybe not?

07:03.386 --> 07:05.586
(sputtering)
(Archer and Cyril shout)

07:05.588 --> 07:07.638
RAY: Because that.
(sputtering)

07:07.640 --> 07:10.391
(Archer and Cyril shout)
And that.

07:10.393 --> 07:12.793
Happy?
ARCHER: What, like, in

07:12.795 --> 07:15.679
general or...?
MALORY: Ooh, this is

07:15.681 --> 07:18.432
exciting.
I hope everyone dies.

07:18.434 --> 07:24.772
ARCHER: Uh, we obviously d...
Oh. Hardy har, Mother.

07:24.774 --> 07:27.274
(slurps)

07:30.138 --> 07:33.356
MALORY: And so our heroes,
such as they are, have run out

07:33.596 --> 07:37.665
of fuel and... what.
RAY: No, no, no!

07:37.667 --> 07:40.284
What are you doing?!
CYRIL: Throwing out the guns!

07:40.286 --> 07:43.404
RAY: No, no, no, no, no!
You're screwing the trim all to

07:43.406 --> 07:45.673
hell!
ARCHER (chuckles): This

07:45.675 --> 07:48.259
no-phrasing thing is killing me.
RAY: Best case, our

07:48.261 --> 07:51.412
glide ratio's maybe ten-to-one.
But it's a lot less with the

07:51.414 --> 07:53.714
damn door hanging...
Oh, no, no, no!

07:53.716 --> 07:56.100
(automatic gunfire)
CYRIL: Yeah!

07:56.102 --> 07:58.252
ARCHER: Woooooo!!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:58.254 --> 08:00.254
(Archer and Cyril grunt)
RAY: You idiots!

08:00.256 --> 08:02.256
CYRIL: What did I do?
ARCHER: Don't. There's no

08:02.258 --> 08:04.275
talking to when he gets like
this.

08:04.277 --> 08:06.561
RAY: Dump the damn guns!
CYRIL: Uh, I am, if you'd

08:06.563 --> 08:08.613
shut up!
ARCHER: Wait, wait, wait,

08:08.615 --> 08:11.599
wait, Cyril!
CYRIL: What? Archer!

08:11.601 --> 08:13.701
RAY: We're coming in!
Brace for landing!

08:13.703 --> 08:16.370
ARCHER: Tell you in a minute.
RAY: Gear down!

08:16.372 --> 08:19.323
(Cyril moans)
RAY (strained): We're not

08:19.325 --> 08:24.378
gonna make it.
(Cyril whimpers)

08:24.380 --> 08:29.000
ARCHER: Exciting, isn't it?
(Cyril yelping)

08:29.002 --> 08:34.222
(Archer chuckling)
ARCHER: Oh, so, Cyril...

08:34.224 --> 08:38.392
what I was gonna say was...
maybe don't throw out all the

08:38.394 --> 08:41.679
guns because you know what they
say...

08:41.681 --> 08:43.764
it's better to have a gun and
not need it than to be the

08:43.765 --> 08:47.301
world's biggest dickhead, and
inside your head there's a

08:47.303 --> 08:50.771
million more dicks, like, uh, if
you cut open a golf ball, only

08:50.773 --> 08:53.357
instead of those little rubber
bands in there, it's just, you

08:53.359 --> 08:55.776
know...
CYRIL: Dicks?

08:55.778 --> 08:58.329
ARCHER: Oh, so you have heard
that.

08:58.331 --> 09:01.315
MALORY: And so Gillette lands
safely-- I'm sure there's a joke

09:01.317 --> 09:04.118
in there about fairy dust-- and
then what happens?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.120
CYRIL (chuckles): Yeah, tell
her what happens next.

09:06.122 --> 09:08.122
ARCHER: I will if you shut
your... mouth.

09:08.124 --> 09:11.125
(quietly): Okay, listen up.
Say what you will about my

09:11.127 --> 09:13.160
skills as a drug kingpin...
RAY: You don't have any.

09:13.162 --> 09:15.162
CYRIL: Completely
nonexistent.

09:15.164 --> 09:17.164
ARCHER: Are you done?
RAY and CYRIL: Yes.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.350
ARCHER: Good, because if
there's one thing I'm good at,

09:19.352 --> 09:21.469
out of the million other things
I'm good at, it's infiltrating

09:21.471 --> 09:23.504
the enemy with an assumed
identity.

09:23.506 --> 09:25.506
RAY: Named Randy.
ARCHER: Named shut up, it's

09:25.508 --> 09:27.508
not always Randy.
GILLETTE (chuckling): Oh, my

09:27.510 --> 09:29.510
God.
CYRIL: Always.

09:29.512 --> 09:32.280
(others agreeing)
ARCHER: That's because

09:32.282 --> 09:35.182
Randy's awesome!
And I'm the best in the world at

09:35.184 --> 09:38.536
this, so shut up and follow my
lead.

09:38.538 --> 09:42.856
Hey, guy... (grunts)
(Ray and Cyril squeak)

09:42.858 --> 09:45.543
SLATER: Anybody else in
there?

09:45.545 --> 09:48.862
RAY and CYRIL: No.
(others reacting in shock)

09:48.864 --> 09:51.582
MALORY: Sterling, how are you
not dead?

09:51.584 --> 09:53.867
ARCHER (sighs): Because I
didn't get shot with buckshot.

09:53.869 --> 09:56.254
I got beanbagged.
(Pam growls)

09:56.256 --> 09:59.223
Beanbagged, Pam.
(others gasp, groan)

09:59.225 --> 10:01.225
MALORY: Oh, my God.
ARCHER: Yeah, I could've

10:01.227 --> 10:03.227
died.
CYRIL (scoffs): It was a

10:03.229 --> 10:05.713
beanbag.
ARCHER: Medical fact, Cyril.

10:05.715 --> 10:08.516
If you get hit in the chest
between heartbeats, you can die.

10:08.518 --> 10:10.568
Go ask Houdini.
PAM (chuckling): Ask him

10:10.570 --> 10:16.407
what, how to get AIDS?
MALORY (sighs): So who were

10:16.409 --> 10:18.776
these goons?
ARCHER: They were... They

10:18.778 --> 10:21.412
kind of looked ex-military, now
that you mention it.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.414
MALORY: American.
ARCHER: Yeah, and the

10:23.416 --> 10:25.666
leader's name was...
SLATER: Slater.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.402
Just call me Slater.
And sorry about the beanbag.

10:28.404 --> 10:30.904
Man, that must kill.
ARCHER: Yeah. Yeah, you hear

10:30.906 --> 10:34.458
beanbag," you think Beanie
Baby, not... internal bleeding.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.677
SLATER: Well, the door was
shot off, and we didn't know who

10:36.679 --> 10:39.380
you were.
Still don't, I guess, formally,

10:39.382 --> 10:42.800
uh...
ARCHER: Uh, Rand... o.

10:42.802 --> 10:44.802
SLATER: Rando.
ARCHER: Yep.

10:44.804 --> 10:47.388
SLATER: Rando...?
ARCHER: Uh, no, that's it.

10:47.390 --> 10:51.142
It's a mononym, like Cher.
CYRIL: Pliny.

10:51.144 --> 10:53.144
RAY: Cantinflas!
SLATER: I know what "mononym"

10:53.146 --> 10:55.446
means.
What I don't know is who you

10:55.448 --> 10:57.815
people are.
ARCHER: Uh, I'm Rando-- I

10:57.817 --> 11:01.369
think we covered that fairly
well-- and these are the, uh,

11:01.371 --> 11:03.871
McCracken brothers, Phil and
Odie.

11:03.873 --> 11:05.873
CYRIL: Hello.
RAY: Odie, hush.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.875
SLATER: So why do you guys
have my cocaine?

11:07.877 --> 11:09.910
ARCHER: We...
SLATER: I'm not done.

11:09.912 --> 11:11.963
ARCHER: Sorry.
SLATER: What have you done

11:11.965 --> 11:14.165
with Gomez...

11:14.167 --> 11:18.803
What, you're just not gonna
answer?

11:18.805 --> 11:21.922
ARCHER: Oh! S-Sorry.
You kind of trailed off like

11:21.924 --> 11:24.809
there was, like, a third...
SLATER: Why do you have my

11:24.811 --> 11:27.928
cocaine and where the hell is
Gomez, full goddamn stop!

11:27.930 --> 11:30.264
ARCHER: Gomez was gonna steal
it.

11:30.266 --> 11:32.516
SLATER: Says who?
ARCHER (chuckles): "Who."

11:32.518 --> 11:35.770
Nice.
Anyway, they called us in, uh,

11:35.772 --> 11:40.808
to address that, which we did
and now we're here and...

11:40.810 --> 11:46.914
Full stop?
TOUGH GUY: Okay, this is the

11:46.916 --> 11:48.833
last of it.
The weight's good.

11:48.835 --> 11:50.951
We tested ten of the bricks.
Looks like it's all here.

11:50.953 --> 11:52.953
SLATER: Well, either you guys
are the shittiest coke thieves

11:52.955 --> 11:54.955
on the planet...
CYRIL (chuckles): Which we

11:54.957 --> 11:57.758
are not.
(chuckles) You know, I mean, if

11:57.760 --> 12:00.211
that was... I mean, if we put
our minds to it.

12:00.213 --> 12:02.263
Look, here's the thing about the
McCracken brothers...

12:02.265 --> 12:04.465
ARCHER: Odie, hush!
Uh, you were saying?

12:04.467 --> 12:06.834
SLATER: Hey, between you and
me, I thought Gomez was hinky

12:06.836 --> 12:09.670
from the get-go and, since the
coke's all here, let's get you

12:09.672 --> 12:12.723
fellas loaded.
ARCHER: Yeah, now you're

12:12.725 --> 12:16.894
talking.
About something else entirely.

12:16.896 --> 12:18.979
Apparently.
SLATER (chuckles): What, did

12:18.981 --> 12:21.399
you nerf-nuts think I was
talking about getting drunk?

12:21.401 --> 12:25.286
ARCHER: Uh, yeah, on money.
SLATER (laughing): Oh, man,

12:25.288 --> 12:27.788
classic Rando.
And don't worry, Calderon's good

12:27.790 --> 12:30.624
for the money.
At least for now.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.793
Am I right, fellas?
ARCHER: Are you?

12:32.795 --> 12:35.463
SLATER (laughs): Classic
Rando.

12:35.465 --> 12:37.581
ARCHER (chuckles): Yeah,
Rando's awesome.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.583
SLATER: So, obviously you're
not gonna be able to pressurize

12:39.585 --> 12:41.585
this baby, so, uh...
RAY: I'll keep it under

12:41.587 --> 12:43.587
8,000.
SLATER: Still gonna freeze

12:43.589 --> 12:45.639
your asses off.
Good thing you're flying south,

12:45.641 --> 12:47.708
huh?
ARCHER: Mmm... yep.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.643
SLATER: You do know where
you're going, right?

12:49.645 --> 12:51.645
ARCHER: I absolutely know
where we're going.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.648
CYRIL: Yeah, back home to
ask Mommy what to do.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.851
ARCHER: Hey, shut up!
CYRIL: You shut up!

12:56.853 --> 13:03.240
ARCHER: Ow. (grunts)
Ma, they done killed old Rando.

13:05.291 --> 13:08.249
LANA: So, you leave here with
a bunch of the first load of

13:08.396 --> 13:12.289
cocaine, which just mysteriously
appeared at ISIS and that Malory

13:12.289 --> 13:14.319
swears wasn't hers...
MALORY: Because it most

13:14.319 --> 13:17.293
certainly was not!
CYRIL: Wait, then where did it come from?

13:17.413 --> 13:18.857
MALORY: Obviously from Sterling.
ARCHER: Obviously from Mother.

13:18.977 --> 13:20.408
MALORY and ARCHER: No, not from me!

13:20.528 --> 13:24.209
Well, I certainly...
(high-pitched whistle)

13:24.329 --> 13:25.137
(others groaning)
LANA: Sorry to break that up.

13:25.257 --> 13:28.504
I love <i>Freaky Friday</i> as much as
the next gal, but let's just

13:28.624 --> 13:31.433
press on, operating under the
assumption that one, or more

13:31.507 --> 13:33.673
likely both, of you are lying
and that...

13:33.675 --> 13:35.178
MALORY and ARCHER: Lana, I swear...

13:35.298 --> 13:38.144
LANA (whistles): Pressing on.
So then you stumble into another

13:38.146 --> 13:41.281
bunch of cocaine in the jungle
and then continue stumbling into

13:41.283 --> 13:45.585
a beanbagging arms dealer, so
that now, almost inexplicably,

13:45.587 --> 13:48.321
we have enough weapons to invade
Quebec.

13:48.323 --> 13:50.590
KRIEGER: Wait, literally?
LANA: No, Krieger, not

13:50.592 --> 13:52.592
literally.
PAM: Aww.

13:52.594 --> 13:54.594
CHERLENE: Lame.
KRIEGER: Well, if we ever do,

13:54.596 --> 13:56.730
the best time to invade is
right after brunch, when

13:56.732 --> 13:58.732
they're all logy.
LANA: Archer?

13:58.734 --> 14:01.134
ARCHER: I don't know.
I mean, it couldn't hurt, but...

14:01.136 --> 14:03.136
LANA: Still talking about
this.

14:03.138 --> 14:05.372
Not invading Quebec.
ARCHER: Oh, yeah, then they

14:05.374 --> 14:07.741
loaded the plane with the
weapons, said we were heading

14:07.743 --> 14:10.343
south and that Calderon would
pay us.

14:10.345 --> 14:14.114
LANA: Calderon?
(gasps) As in Gustavo Calderon?

14:14.116 --> 14:18.018
ARCHER (burps): Should I know
who that is?

14:18.020 --> 14:20.053
CYRIL: How could you not?
ARCHER: I don't know, Cyril.

14:20.055 --> 14:23.323
Maybe I was busy saving your
life once, and then you shot me.

14:23.325 --> 14:27.193
MALORY: Gustavo Calderon, aka
Baby Gus, is the president of

14:27.195 --> 14:29.195
San Marcos.
(Archer burps)

14:29.197 --> 14:31.398
ARCHER: Should I know...
MALORY: Oh for God's sake,

14:31.400 --> 14:34.701
Sterling, it's a country in
Central America.

14:34.703 --> 14:36.736
ARCHER: Mm, not according to
this.

14:36.738 --> 14:38.738
LANA: Because that thing's a
hundred years old.

14:38.740 --> 14:40.740
It still says "German East
Africa."

14:40.742 --> 14:42.676
KRIEGER: We will <i>never</i>
<i>recognize Tanganyika!</i>

14:42.678 --> 14:44.678
<i>LANA: Well, it's Tanzania</i>
<i>now, so...</i>

14:44.680 --> 14:46.680
<i>PAM: Aww.</i>
<i>CHERLENE: Lame.</i>

14:46.682 --> 14:48.682
<i>KRIEGER: Well, whatever, as</i>
<i>long as they don't nationalize</i>

14:48.684 --> 14:51.251
<i>the ivory trade.</i>
<i>I don't think my portfolio can</i>

14:51.253 --> 14:55.055
<i>take the hit.</i>
<i>LANA: Trust me, San Marcos is</i>

14:55.057 --> 14:57.390
<i>a country.</i>
<i>MALORY: And it's in the</i>

14:57.392 --> 14:59.693
<i>middle of a civil war.</i>
<i>Communist rebels are tearing</i>

14:59.695 --> 15:02.062
<i>through the countryside like...</i>
<i>like...</i>

15:02.064 --> 15:04.164
<i>PAM: Cows.</i>
<i>Bees.</i>

15:04.166 --> 15:06.499
<i>Hang on.</i>
<i>Bees.</i>

15:06.501 --> 15:09.235
<i>MALORY (sighs): How do you</i>
<i>not know about San Marcos?</i>

15:09.237 --> 15:12.272
<i>It's all over the news every</i>
<i>night.</i>

15:12.274 --> 15:14.691
<i>ANCHORMAN: from San Marcos</i>
<i>tonight, as the Communist rebel</i>

15:14.693 --> 15:18.194
<i>forces consolidate their gains</i>
<i>in the countryside, and now</i>

15:18.196 --> 15:21.698
<i>prepare to move on the capital.</i>
<i>We spoke with President Gustavo</i>

15:21.700 --> 15:25.652
<i>Calderon, seen here volunteering</i>
<i>at the hospital, comforting the</i>

15:25.654 --> 15:27.687
<i>wounded.</i>
<i>CALDERON: Oh, hello, I did</i>

15:27.689 --> 15:29.689
<i>not see you there.</i>
<i>I was comforting this brave</i>

15:29.691 --> 15:33.860
<i>young man here, the fruit of San</i>
<i>Marcos, wounded by a Communist</i>

15:33.862 --> 15:36.413
<i>sneeper.</i>
<i>I think he has died.</i>

15:36.415 --> 15:38.832
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>But let me say this, to the</i>

15:38.834 --> 15:41.885
<i>Communists who are murdering</i>
<i>our brave young fruits, and to</i>

15:41.887 --> 15:45.639
<i>the puppet masters in Moscow and</i>
<i>the capital of China, you</i>

15:45.641 --> 15:48.341
<i>cannot kill the spirit of</i>
<i>San Mar...</i>

15:48.343 --> 15:50.343
<i>PAM: Aww.</i>
<i>CHERLENE: Lame.</i>

15:50.345 --> 15:53.146
<i>As in who cares.</i>
<i>MALORY: The United States.</i>

15:53.148 --> 15:55.348
<i>Apparently Calderon is barely</i>
<i>clinging to power.</i>

15:55.350 --> 15:57.350
<i>ARCHER: Huh.</i>
<i>You think this is somehow</i>

15:57.352 --> 15:59.352
<i>related?</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

15:59.354 --> 16:01.387
<i>I'm kidding, obviously.</i>
<i>RAY: Are you?</i>

16:01.389 --> 16:03.389
<i>PAM: Yeah, right.</i>
<i>LANA: I don't think you are.</i>

16:03.391 --> 16:05.575
<i>ARCHER: Yes, I'm kidding.</i>
<i>Because you want to know what I</i>

16:05.577 --> 16:08.278
<i>really think is going on here?</i>
<i>CHERLENE: You're all jealous!</i>

16:08.280 --> 16:11.164
<i>My album's coming out, and it's</i>
<i>gonna be huge, and you're all</i>

16:11.166 --> 16:13.450
<i>jealous, and so you just want</i>
<i>to ruin it for me.</i>

16:13.452 --> 16:15.735
<i>MALORY: Why would I</i> want to
ruin your album?

16:15.737 --> 16:19.205
I get 50% of the profits.
LANA: Archer?

16:19.207 --> 16:21.591
ARCHER: I don't know, maybe
a little jealous.

16:21.593 --> 16:23.593
It's an exciting time for her.
LANA: This.

16:23.595 --> 16:25.912
Still talking about this.
ARCHER: Oh, right, right,

16:25.914 --> 16:27.914
right.
So what I think is...

16:27.916 --> 16:30.467
MALORY: I think you've
managed to stumble backwards

16:30.469 --> 16:32.852
into a CIA-backed,
anti-Communist,

16:32.854 --> 16:36.356
drugs-for-arms operation.
ARCHER: Wow, that actually

16:36.358 --> 16:38.358
makes more sense.
LANA: Than...?

16:38.360 --> 16:40.393
ARCHER: No, no, let's just go
with her thing.

16:40.395 --> 16:42.312
CYRIL: Which, if it's true,
is...

16:42.314 --> 16:44.314
MALORY: Wonderful.
CYRIL: I was going to say

16:44.316 --> 16:46.316
terrible.
MALORY: Because you are a

16:46.318 --> 16:49.119
timid man, Cyril.
CYRIL: What? No, I'm not.

16:49.121 --> 16:52.238
PAM (laughing): Dude, your
balls are made of pussy.

16:52.240 --> 16:56.376
(Archer laughs)
ARCHER: Aah! Ow. Oh.

16:56.378 --> 16:58.828
All kidding aside, I maybe
should go to a hospital.

16:58.830 --> 17:01.581
MALORY: Cyril, this is an
opportunity to finally make

17:01.583 --> 17:03.883
some money.
Even if we had a buyer for the

17:03.885 --> 17:08.221
cocaine, do we even still have
half of it left?

17:08.223 --> 17:10.507
KRIEGER: Eh...
MALORY: What?

17:10.509 --> 17:12.625
KRIEGER: It's, um, you know,
not... It's...

17:12.627 --> 17:14.627
MALORY: Krieger!
KRIEGER: Mm?

17:14.628 --> 17:16.762
MALORY: Tell me what's going
on or I will literally

17:16.765 --> 17:19.682
emasculate you.
KRIEGER: Well, no, if you

17:19.684 --> 17:23.236
literally emas... (coughs)
Okay, so, for a few weeks, I've

17:23.238 --> 17:25.972
been working on a bit of a side
project.

17:25.973 --> 17:31.411
I give you...
the <i>Red Kriegtober.</i>

17:31.413 --> 17:33.413
<i>LANA: Um...</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Or the Red</i>

17:33.415 --> 17:35.448
<i>OctKrieger.</i>
<i>I can't decide.</i>

17:35.450 --> 17:38.251
<i>It's a narco-sub.</i>
<i>For transporting cocaine.</i>

17:38.253 --> 17:40.420
<i>It's totally undetectable by</i>
<i>the Coast Guard.</i>

17:40.422 --> 17:42.372
<i>Thoughts?</i>
<i>LANA: How you gonna get it</i>

17:42.374 --> 17:44.340
<i>out of here?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Hm?</i>

17:44.342 --> 17:49.462
<i>LANA: How does that thing</i>
<i>leave this room?</i>

17:49.464 --> 17:52.348
<i>KRIEGER: Goddamn it!</i>
<i>MALORY: Oh, for the...</i>

17:52.350 --> 17:55.268
<i>How much money did you waste on</i>
<i>that little boondoggle?</i>

17:55.270 --> 17:57.470
<i>KRIEGER: Well, it's not that</i>
<i>so much as...</i>

17:57.472 --> 17:59.856
<i>MALORY: Krieger?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Well, I needed</i>

17:59.858 --> 18:03.309
<i>ballast, and what better to</i>
<i>simulate bricks of cocaine than,</i>

18:03.311 --> 18:06.196
<i>you know, bricks of cocaine?</i>
<i>MALORY: Krieger...</i>

18:06.198 --> 18:08.948
<i>KRIEGER: And when I realized</i>
<i>it would never feel the wind on</i>

18:08.950 --> 18:14.487
<i>its face, or taste the salty</i>
<i>spray of the sea, I... I...</i>

18:14.489 --> 18:18.958
<i>(explosions)</i>
<i>MALORY: You what?</i>

18:18.960 --> 18:22.495
<i>KRIEGER: I blew it up!</i>
<i>Goddamn you all to hell, I blew</i>

18:22.497 --> 18:24.631
<i>it up!</i>
<i>(all exclaiming)</i>

18:24.633 --> 18:26.866
<i>CHERLENE: I'm not cleaning it</i>
<i>up.</i>

18:26.868 --> 18:29.502
<i>PAM: You mean it's all gone?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: I... (sniffles)</i>

18:29.504 --> 18:35.475
<i>No, no, not all of it.</i>
<i>(Pam sobbing)</i>

18:35.477 --> 18:37.894
<i>PAM: Why?</i>
<i>KRIEGER: Shh, shh, shh, shh,</i>

18:37.896 --> 18:40.763
<i>shh, shh, shh.</i>
<i>There, there.</i>

18:40.765 --> 18:43.516
<i>MALORY: Woodhouse, dear, I</i>
<i>need some more ice.</i>

18:43.518 --> 18:46.352
<i>WOODHOUSE: Straightaway, mum.</i>
<i>MALORY: Oh, and a small bowl,</i>

18:46.354 --> 18:48.438
<i>a mirror, a needle and thread,</i>
<i>and a straight razor.</i>

18:48.440 --> 18:50.490
<i>CYRIL: Whoa.</i>
<i>RAY: Just calm down.</i>

18:50.492 --> 18:52.525
<i>ARCHER: Whoa, whoa...</i>
<i>LANA: You're not emasculating</i>

18:52.527 --> 18:54.527
<i>Krieger.</i>
<i>KRIEGER: What the hell was</i>

18:54.529 --> 18:56.529
<i>the mirror for?</i>
<i>MALORY: So you could watch.</i>

<i>(thunder rumbles)</i>
<i>(Krieger squeaks)</i>

18:58.733 --> 19:01.868
<i>(Malory sighs)</i>
<i>MALORY: The perfect ending</i>

19:01.870 --> 19:04.704
<i>to the perfect...</i>
<i>(laughs)</i>

19:04.706 --> 19:08.258
<i>I almost said "evening."</i>
<i>More like months, though,</i>

19:08.260 --> 19:10.460
<i>isn't it?</i>
<i>Since we started scrabbling for</i>

19:10.462 --> 19:14.964
<i>coins because the damn</i>
<i>government took away our...</i>

19:14.966 --> 19:17.750
<i>everything.</i>
<i>They took everything.</i>

19:17.752 --> 19:20.586
<i>And the only thing that was</i>
<i>left, you idiots either lost,</i>

19:20.588 --> 19:25.692
<i>gave away, ate or just blew up</i>
<i>and sank.</i>

19:25.694 --> 19:27.694
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, Krieger.</i>
<i>LANA: Archer.</i>

19:27.696 --> 19:30.313
<i>MALORY: And so, starting now,</i>
<i>in addition to the country</i>

19:30.315 --> 19:34.767
<i>music business, which...</i>
<i>CHERLENE: Right?</i>

19:34.769 --> 19:36.953
<i>MALORY: We are in the arms</i>
<i>business.</i>

19:36.955 --> 19:39.489
<i>KRIEGER: There's still a</i>
<i>little cocaine left.</i>

19:39.491 --> 19:41.491
<i>LANA: Krieger.</i>
<i>ARCHER: Yeah, Krieger.</i>

19:41.493 --> 19:43.493
<i>LANA: And do we want to talk</i>
<i>about this or...</i>

19:43.495 --> 19:46.112
<i>MALORY: You're</i> welcome to.
I, personally, am going to bed.

19:46.114 --> 19:49.916
It's been a long night.
ARCHER: Oh, yeah, wh-why are

19:49.918 --> 19:51.918
you all dressed up?
MALORY: Well, not that it's

19:51.920 --> 19:54.087
any of anyone's business, but I
had dinner with Ron.

19:54.089 --> 19:56.089
ARCHER: What?
CHERLENE: Ooh.

19:56.091 --> 19:58.124
CYRIL: Sounds delightful.
ARCHER: Wait-- you're still

19:58.126 --> 20:00.426
getting divorced, right?
MALORY: No.

20:00.428 --> 20:02.428
We have decided to give it
another chance, and so we will

20:02.430 --> 20:04.430
be going to marriage counseling
and... (mumbles)

20:04.432 --> 20:06.432
ARCHER: Wait, what?
PAM: Huh?

20:06.434 --> 20:08.434
CYRIL: Marriage counseling
and what?

20:08.436 --> 20:10.520
ARCHER: I didn't catch that.
MALORY: Oh, for...

20:10.522 --> 20:13.573
We've decided to have an open
marriage.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.575
CYRIL: Okay.
PAM: Nice.

20:15.577 --> 20:17.694
KRIEGER: Gross.
CHERLENE: Oh, my God.

20:17.696 --> 20:19.696
MALORY: Well, it was either
that or...

20:19.698 --> 20:22.492
(phone rings)
CHERLENE (gasps): Oh, my God.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.924
It's Ron.
Hello...

20:25.044 --> 20:26.326
(all gasping)
ARCHER: Oh, no!

20:26.446 --> 20:28.391
MALORY: And so...
ARCHER: Jesus.

20:28.664 --> 20:30.029
Hope he doesn't call me.

20:30.149 --> 20:32.672
Why would he call you?
(phone ringing)

20:36.885 --> 20:38.262
(clears throat)
