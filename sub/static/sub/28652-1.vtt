Hello?

03:17.665 --> 03:18.830
Hello?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.700
Can I help you?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.436
Oh, yeah, I was looking
to check into a room

04:31.438 --> 04:33.405
and there was nobody
at the front desk.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.374
Well, sir, the check-out
time is 10:00 a.m.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.844
Did you leave some
personal items or...

04:38.846 --> 04:41.947
No, I'm not... I'm not
checking out of a room.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.915
I'm checking into a room.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.884
Oh.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.336
I'm so sorry.

04:47.337 --> 04:48.787
I had you confused
with another guest.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.089
All right, well,
why don't we go on down to the front desk?

04:51.091 --> 04:52.958
I will get you
checked right in.

04:53.527 --> 04:54.626
All right.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.599
Say, is that, uh...

05:00.601 --> 05:03.402
Is that the hair
of a rock star I notice?

05:04.204 --> 05:06.471
I've come
to recognize the type.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.007
No, it's just me being me.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.509
You just arrived?

05:11.545 --> 05:12.711
Yeah.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.913
How do you like it so far?

05:18.152 --> 05:19.785
I like it so far.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.420
Good.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.456
All right. Here is
your room key.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.075
And this is my card.

05:27.076 --> 05:29.226
It's got our main number,
in case you need to get in touch with me.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.798
You'll be in room 37.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.900
There's someone
already booked in that room.

05:38.072 --> 05:39.471
Thirty-seven?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.340
Nonsense.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.408
I've already asked for it
to be cleaned and ready.

05:43.410 --> 05:47.646
I'll be damned if one of our maids hadn't
already cleaned it for ya.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.021
All righty.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.689
Here you go.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.192
Room 37.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.128
If you need anything
at all from us,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.663
just give us a call
at the front desk.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.732
Our staff's
extremely attentive.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.868
Hey, I'll tell you what? We got free
coffee down there in the mornings.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.473
Plus, for lunch,
it's the best dang gumbo in the South.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.109
So, uh, anything else?

06:17.111 --> 06:19.745
No,
that's all right. Here.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.580
- Take that.
- Oh.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.082
Oh, thank you
for your kindness, sir.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.551
Thank you.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.996
Well, it's not pretty,
but it's clean.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.866
I knew, I cleaned
this room yesterday.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.036
Is everything all right, sir?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.206
It's fine.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.510
It's all right.

07:29.383 --> 07:31.883
Here for business,
sir, or pleasure?

07:34.154 --> 07:36.388
Maybe a little bit of both.

07:36.390 --> 07:41.960
Say, what's a pretty face like yours
doin' in a place like this, anyways?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.696
This town is not as bad
as people say it is.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.599
Seems like a pretty good
place to get away for a while.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.102
Get away from what?

07:51.405 --> 07:52.804
Everything.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.610
So, do you got a name, or should I
just keep calling you "pretty face"?

07:59.146 --> 08:00.812
My name is Iris.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.084
And you, sir?

08:10.224 --> 08:11.857
Just Johnny.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.260
Well, Just Johnny,

08:16.363 --> 08:18.630
if you need anything,

08:18.632 --> 08:20.499
you know where to find me.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.201
I've lived here
for quite a while.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.104
I can tell you where to find
all the jewels of the city.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.074
Say, talkin' about jewels
of the city,

08:29.076 --> 08:31.943
what's the best place
to go for a drink around here?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.881
There's a good spot
right up the street.

08:37.251 --> 08:39.518
A good rock 'n' roll bar.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.953
You'd like it.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.054
Thanks, babe.

08:44.491 --> 08:45.991
Don't mention it.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.295
Ms. Alexander...

08:55.869 --> 08:58.003
You're gonna let me
clean your room today?

09:49.056 --> 09:50.822
Oh, it's great.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.192
It's wonderful. Yeah,
it's just how everybody says it is, huh.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.895
They got the greatest music
in the world here.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.831
<i>I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, I was taking a cab</i>

09:59.833 --> 10:02.901
<i>over to the hotel,
and I walk down the street,</i>

10:02.903 --> 10:05.770
<i>and there's people just
singing up and down the street.</i>

10:05.772 --> 10:07.472
I'm doing fine. Yeah.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.441
Yeah. No, no, no.
My health's good.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.476
I'm drinking my milk,
you know.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.996
<i>Actually, I...</i>

10:14.997 --> 10:18.515
<i>I've been getting some more of
those bumps on my back, you know.</i>

10:18.518 --> 10:21.586
No, Mariann.
Mariann, no, no, no.

10:21.588 --> 10:25.924
I'm not gonna go
to the hospital, okay? No.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.460
All right? I don't trust
those guys. I don't...

10:28.462 --> 10:30.528
Okay, listen.
I got a surprise for you.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.564
I got something for you.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.367
And I'm not gonna
let you down this time, okay?

10:35.369 --> 10:36.935
So, are you listenin'?

10:40.674 --> 10:43.742
I got $20,000 right here.

10:43.744 --> 10:47.879
$20,000 that I made
in Japan and Germany.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.848
I'm gonna pay
for your mortgage.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.250
<i>I'm gonna send you money in
the next couple of days, okay?</i>

10:52.252 --> 10:55.153
<i>Sylvain's gonna call me
in a couple of minutes.</i>

10:55.155 --> 10:59.524
<i>And uh, I can't make calls
from here, so, I think</i>

10:59.526 --> 11:03.895
<i>I need to hang up soon, just
to make sure I get his call.</i>

11:03.897 --> 11:06.931
<i>Okay, and listen,
you better call me. Okay?</i>

11:09.002 --> 11:14.072
If, if, if you get a...
If you get a call from her,

11:14.074 --> 11:18.309
then just get back to me, all right?
I wanna know where they are.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.146
<i>And I wanna see...</i>

11:21.148 --> 11:23.081
<i>I really wanna
see 'em again and...</i>

11:23.083 --> 11:26.051
And I'm getting myself
back together. I'm healthier

11:26.053 --> 11:28.586
than I've ever...
Than I've ever been.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.389
<i>I'm staying here.
I'm gonna get clean.</i>

11:31.391 --> 11:35.093
<i>And then when I get clean,
we'll have a dinner together, okay?</i>

11:35.562 --> 11:37.095
But in the meantime,

11:37.097 --> 11:40.098
tell Ma to save
some spaghetti for me, okay?

11:40.100 --> 11:42.801
<i>All right.</i>

11:54.581 --> 11:56.081
<i>Last time we tried this,</i>

11:56.083 --> 11:58.950
<i>Jerry and I were the only
ones who showed up, Johnny.</i>

11:58.952 --> 12:01.920
<i>- Where were you?</i>
- Listen, if David's involved,

12:01.922 --> 12:05.523
I'm not gonna do it. That's it.
Fine and simple. All right?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.625
I'm not going on stage
with that clown

12:07.627 --> 12:11.629
after he did all that Buster
Poindexter shit. He sold out.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.566
<i>We're all in a different
place in our lives, also.</i>

12:14.568 --> 12:19.304
<i>Hey, there's not enough room
on stage for the two of us, okay?</i>

12:19.306 --> 12:21.206
<i>He takes up all the room.</i>

12:21.208 --> 12:23.241
<i>Why don't you
talk to him, Johnny?</i>

12:23.243 --> 12:26.845
I suggest you get yourself
a new guitar player

12:26.847 --> 12:28.880
who's gonna stand in a spot

12:28.882 --> 12:32.016
while David struts around
and sings all the songs.

12:32.018 --> 12:36.621
Or, or if you don't want
David to be involved,

12:36.623 --> 12:39.157
<i>I'll play with you.</i>

12:39.158 --> 12:41.692
<i>I'll play with you. I'll play with Jerry.
I'll play with Arthur.</i>

12:41.695 --> 12:44.629
<i>Just give it some time
and think about it, Johnny.</i>

12:44.631 --> 12:47.165
All right, man.
Have a good one.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.367
<i>Yeah, you take care
of yourself, too.</i>

12:49.903 --> 12:51.970
<i>We all miss you, man.</i>

12:51.972 --> 12:54.405
- Talk to you later.
<i>- Just think about it.</i>

12:54.641 --> 12:56.040
Bye-bye.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.547

Johnny Thunders,

15:24.224 --> 15:27.625
God damn it, for a second
I thought you were a fan.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.062
Thought I'd run
into you eventually.

15:31.064 --> 15:34.699
Yeah. I've been here,
uh, 10 years come June.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.769
- How do you like it?
- Mm.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.671
I love it. I love it.

15:41.341 --> 15:45.543
It's been about three years
since I saw you.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.980
Look about 10 years older,
man. You all right?

15:51.851 --> 15:53.451
Do I look all right?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.454
Ah...

15:56.456 --> 15:58.856
So, uh, you making
a record down here?

15:58.858 --> 16:01.492
Man, you should hear what the
new kids are doing these days,

16:01.494 --> 16:02.827
new bands.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.262
I don't listen to new music.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.831
Oh, you don't listen
to new music. Nothing?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.000
No. Next question.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.103
Guy bought you a drink.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.207
Said he's your biggest fan.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.678
Great. Tell him I said thanks.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.047
See?

16:23.049 --> 16:25.917
You got fans in all kinds
of places, baby.

16:25.919 --> 16:28.720
You'd have to hide in the sun and run
in the shadows to get out of here,

16:28.722 --> 16:29.854
getting rid of these people.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.390
Yeah. Those bastards.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.293
Hey, at least I got a free drink.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.929
At least I won't die alone.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.697
Yeah.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.734
So, how's everything back home?

16:47.273 --> 16:48.539
Home.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.010
Home, home, home.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.248
Home is where the heart is.

16:58.852 --> 17:03.087
How's the family?
How's the kid, Jamie?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.459
She just, uh,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.530
had her fourth birthday.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.401
I haven't seen her in forever.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.804
How's the old lady?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.240
Ran off with the kids.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.246
Well, hey. What are you
doing in New Orleans?

17:30.016 --> 17:34.118
Well,
trying to start over.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.421
Escape.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.857
Well, you came
into the right place.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.294
Actually, I need
to buy some new material.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.730
Why don't you get in the
studio, record some stuff for me

17:45.732 --> 17:47.832
and I'll pay you
for your time?

17:50.937 --> 17:52.336
Well...

17:54.941 --> 17:57.341
We'll see if I have time.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.744
All right.
Where are you staying?

18:01.481 --> 18:04.482
St. Peter's hotel,
down the block.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.783
That's nice.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.119
Definitely.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.221
So, um...

18:11.891 --> 18:14.225
You still living
on Chinese rock?

18:17.664 --> 18:18.796
No.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.365
I'm, uh,

18:21.367 --> 18:24.735
going straight.
I'm on methadone maintenance.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.170
I'm clean.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.110
Trying to start a new chapter,

18:32.846 --> 18:34.278
you know.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.214
Times are changing.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.450
Well, I will drink to that.

18:39.452 --> 18:43.221
Here's to the second coming
of the almighty Johnny Thunders.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.923
Don't tell everyone
at once. Jesus.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.925
<i>Thank you. Thank you!</i>

18:47.927 --> 18:51.395
<i>I've just been informed we have
a celebrity in the house tonight.</i>

18:51.397 --> 18:53.931
<i>How many of you remember
the New York Dolls?</i>

18:55.602 --> 18:59.137
Speak of the fucking devil,
man. You can't escape it.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.072
<i>And Johnny Thunders
is in the house.</i>

19:01.074 --> 19:03.508
Yeah!

19:04.544 --> 19:05.510
Did you do this?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.979
No, no, no, man.
Don't look at me.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.032
This is your comeback, baby.

19:11.033 --> 19:14.084
<i>Now, I would be honored if you'd come
up on stage and do a song with us.</i>

19:14.087 --> 19:16.220
No, I can't...

19:16.222 --> 19:18.789
- Come on.
- I'm sorry. No thanks though, okay?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.925
Come on, man.

19:22.795 --> 19:26.597
All right, all right, just one song.
One song, all right?

19:27.667 --> 19:31.402
Then you better
drink my drink. Yeah?

19:33.206 --> 19:34.472
Say, what...

19:34.474 --> 19:36.874
<i>What do you kids
wanna hear anyways, huh?</i>

19:36.876 --> 19:40.311
<i>You wanna dance, or you just
wanna stand around being assholes?</i>

19:40.313 --> 19:42.547
I wanna dance...

19:42.549 --> 19:45.950
All right, I'll play you your
favorite song, <i>Born To Lose.</i>

19:57.397 --> 20:00.731
<i>♪ That's the way it goes</i>

20:00.733 --> 20:03.901
<i>♪ This city is so cold</i>

20:03.903 --> 20:07.205
<i>♪ And I'm, I'm so sold</i>

20:07.207 --> 20:11.209
<i>♪ That's why I know
I said hit it</i>

20:11.211 --> 20:13.377
<i>- ♪ Born to lose
- ♪ Born to lose</i>

20:14.247 --> 20:15.880
<i>- ♪ Born to lose
- ♪ Born to lose</i>

20:17.483 --> 20:19.784
<i>- ♪ Born to lose
- ♪ Born to lose, oh</i>

20:19.786 --> 20:23.054
<i>- ♪ Baby, I'm born to lose
- ♪ Baby, I'm born to lose, oh</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:25.690
<i>♪ Nothing to do</i>

20:26.793 --> 20:29.894
<i>♪ Oh, nothing to say</i>

20:29.896 --> 20:33.164
<i>♪ Only one thing that I want</i>

20:33.166 --> 20:36.634

20:36.636 --> 20:40.071
<i>♪ Born to lose

<i>- ♪ Born to lose

21:05.765 --> 21:09.166
Hey! Hey, man.
Johnny. Come on, Johnny.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.319
Shit!

21:28.321 --> 21:29.720
Back up. Hey, hey, hey.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.956
Back up. Back up!
Give him some space.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.691
You okay?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.059
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.762
Back up! Back up, all right?
Give him some fucking air.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.765
Come on. All right. Stand up.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.433
Stand up. Come on.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.502
Here we go.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.211
I'm fine, all right?
I'm all right.

21:54.213 --> 21:55.479
- You are not fine.
- Yeah.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.648
No, you're not.
Sit the fuck down.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.651
Listen, I'll sleep it off.
Walk it off.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.886
- I'm worried about you.
- Fuck.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.155
This is not okay, man.
You can't live like this.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.823
I'm good.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.991
You're not good.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.527
This is bad.
Man, I mean, like,

22:09.529 --> 22:12.463
you look like shit.
You just took a swan dive

22:12.465 --> 22:14.532
off of a stage 20 minutes ago.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.834
That? It happens
all the time, man.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.737
All right, all right?
They love that shit.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.938
Okay?

22:22.275 --> 22:24.809
The audience
loves that shit, man.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.577
Fucking love it...

22:26.579 --> 22:29.113
Here.

22:29.115 --> 22:32.049
- Here. Here.
- Where's the lighter? Oh.

22:39.559 --> 22:43.160
Man, I'm worried about you,
I don't like this.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.428
I don't like this.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.030
You don't look good.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.498
What, do I look that bad?

22:47.500 --> 22:51.035
Stop worrying, all right?
I got things going for me, okay?

22:51.037 --> 22:55.339
I got a recording session
tomorrow, just down the street.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.641
Okay. Where?
Where you recording?

22:57.643 --> 23:00.311
I'm recording with Cliff.
You wanna come by?

23:00.313 --> 23:03.414
You need to take it easy.
Like a breather.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.750
Yeah, I am. I'm taking it easy,
man. Look at me.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.985
- I am looking at you. You're not taking it easy.
- Okay? I am easy, huh?

23:07.987 --> 23:09.920
- You're not taking it easy.
- Huh? I'm easy.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.989
- What? What do you want me to do?
- All right.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.657
Kiss you goodnight?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.327
No, man, I'm... Come on.

23:16.329 --> 23:17.695
You look like shit.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.263
I'm just worried
about you, man. You took...

23:19.265 --> 23:21.332
The audience loves
that shit, okay?

23:21.334 --> 23:24.468
You know, your friends don't. All right?
And we're worried about you, okay?

23:24.470 --> 23:27.438
This isn't good.
I'm worried, man.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.140
All right. Look, I'm gonna
get out of here, all right?

23:29.142 --> 23:31.742
You sure you don't want me to stick
around just for like an hour or so?

23:31.744 --> 23:34.478
No, man. Calm down.
Get some sleep.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.147
Do some meditation.

23:36.149 --> 23:38.215
Do whatever
you guys do to, like,

23:38.217 --> 23:41.252
get your shit together. All right?
It's all right. I'm fine.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.622
- All right, my friend. Come on.
Come on. -Okay? Get some sleep.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.045
All right?

23:51.046 --> 23:52.329
All right. And you're
going to sleep?

23:52.331 --> 23:55.433
I'm taking care of myself.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.201
I'm fine.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.804
All right.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.605
Good night.

24:02.675 --> 24:03.874
Okay.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.709
All right, man.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.273
Well, that should
take care of the clog.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.710
These old pipes,
they get full of God knows what

25:12.712 --> 25:15.246
every time a heavy rain
washes through.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.816
Delroy, let me have the...

25:19.151 --> 25:20.618
Thanks.

25:22.455 --> 25:24.922
Hey, guys,
can you check mine out, too?

25:24.924 --> 25:27.057
Earlier it was
making some noise.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.286
Hey!

29:57.696 --> 29:59.096
No.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.102
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

30:05.104 --> 30:06.370
No!

30:06.806 --> 30:10.374
No! Fuck! Fuck!

30:20.519 --> 30:23.287
Fuck!

30:27.726 --> 30:30.561
What the fuck!

30:44.743 --> 30:46.109
Fuck!

30:46.111 --> 30:48.178
Look, I'm just having
a hard time understanding.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.548
Can you explain it one more time?
Mrs. Alexander did...

30:51.550 --> 30:52.983
I don't know what else to say.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.385
I don't know how else I can
make myself any more clear.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.455
She was in here
and now my shit's gone.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.190
My passport, my ID.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.392
- My money, my medicine, it's all gone.
- Calm down.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.828
Hey, don't tell me
to calm down. I am calm.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.530
You are not listening to me.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.298
She was right here.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.666
Right fucking here.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.202
All right. This is
beyond ridiculous.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.937
You think
I'm making this up?

31:15.107 --> 31:17.140
Earlier, you said
she was not in her room.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.843
You can try to get a hold
of one of her grandsons

31:19.845 --> 31:21.879
and see if
they can find her.

31:23.249 --> 31:27.251
I can assure you that
Mrs. Alexander is too old.

31:27.253 --> 31:30.454
She's not even capable of breaking
into other people's rooms.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.423
She hasn't really been able to
talk or walk in years, Johnny.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.125
Then where is she?

31:35.461 --> 31:36.994
Huh?

31:36.996 --> 31:40.197
How far could she have gone?
How hard could this be?

31:40.199 --> 31:42.199
Where is she?

31:42.200 --> 31:44.200
Look, I am sorry that
your stuff is missing,

31:44.203 --> 31:45.836
or it was stolen, or whatever.

31:45.838 --> 31:49.106
But it's really up to our guests
to make sure that the door is...

31:49.108 --> 31:51.108
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you trying to tell me right now?

31:51.110 --> 31:53.510
Are you trying to tell me
it's my fault that I got robbed?

31:53.512 --> 31:55.445
Is that what you're
trying to say right now?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.314
This is your hotel.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.649
You run this hotel.

31:58.651 --> 32:01.051
It's your responsibility, okay?

32:01.053 --> 32:04.755
My room was broken into,
and I got robbed.

32:04.757 --> 32:06.123
You understand?

32:06.125 --> 32:09.359
I can't come in and lock
the door behind the guest

32:09.361 --> 32:11.628
after they come in
or when you leave.

32:11.630 --> 32:17.067
Look, I will call you if I
hear anything or see anything.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.616
You didn't hear this from me,

32:33.686 --> 32:35.519
but you can always
go to the hospital

32:36.588 --> 32:39.423
to, you know,

32:40.793 --> 32:42.326
feel better.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.438
Sorry, but I cannot
help you. Next?

32:54.440 --> 32:57.441
No, look, seriously.
No. My ID was stolen, okay?

32:57.443 --> 33:00.143
I'm on vacation. I swear I have
a prescription and the paperwork.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.914
Sir, methadone is
not a recreational drug.

33:03.916 --> 33:07.851
And you can only get the recommended
dosage with a valid prescription.

33:07.853 --> 33:10.420
- But I do have a prescription.
- Sir, I gotta get through this line.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.123
What would you rather have me do, huh?
Get loaded in the street?

33:13.125 --> 33:14.858
You're denying me treatment?

33:14.860 --> 33:16.760
If you have a prescription,

33:16.762 --> 33:19.763
we can call your doctor's
office and have them verify.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.631
I need my medication now.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.401
Look, listen.

33:24.403 --> 33:28.605
Okay, what can I do? Look, look.
Listen. Look, please.

33:28.607 --> 33:32.509
- Can I just buy those from you?
- Sir, we don't just hand out drugs.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.314
Can you just tell me
where I can get a dose?

33:37.316 --> 33:41.685
I would suggest that you
talk to your doctor. Next?

33:45.824 --> 33:48.258
They keep making it
harder and harder.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.861
Every year, same bullshit.

33:50.863 --> 33:52.462
Do you have an appointment?

33:52.464 --> 33:55.799
You have a doctor?
Do you have a prescription?

33:56.735 --> 33:58.502
Here's your
fucking prescription.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.244
Give a man a mask,
he'll show you his true face.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.246
Ain't that right, homeboy?

34:09.248 --> 34:10.813
What do you need, man?

34:12.016 --> 34:13.850
Weed? Uppers? Downers?

34:13.851 --> 34:16.786
I got all kind of merchandise
to make you feel real happy.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.255
Like royalty.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.824
- Look, I'm not looking for a fix, all right?
- You're not?

34:21.827 --> 34:24.428
Everybody's looking
for a fix, man.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.695
Where you from?

34:25.697 --> 34:28.065
- Not around here.
- No.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.766
What do you... What are you?

34:30.668 --> 34:31.935
I'm a musician.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.271
Musician. Goddamn!

34:35.107 --> 34:36.706
I'm a musician.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.275
Well, was a musician.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.244
Yeah. Do you know any
methadone clinics around here?

34:42.414 --> 34:44.246
Methadone.

34:46.351 --> 34:49.252
It's tricky to find some
of that shit around this joint.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.289
I do know of a place though.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.058
Deep down in the woods.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.893
Say they got crates
of the shit out there,

34:56.895 --> 34:59.830
like motherfucking
Mayflower crates, yo.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.133
The story goes,

35:03.135 --> 35:05.902
couple of fellas I know
busted into a hospital

35:05.904 --> 35:08.105
and stole a crate of that shit.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.340
Guess who's got that crate?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.509
You do?

35:12.511 --> 35:14.377
No.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.913
But I know who does.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.549
See, my brother, Jimmy,

35:19.551 --> 35:21.151
he was on that shit.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.520
You seem like an all right guy.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.689
So I'll let you in
on a little story.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.758
Jimmy came in here once.

35:30.062 --> 35:32.562
jonesing, looking for a fix.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.231
Wasn't able to shoot up.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.633
Didn't have any methadone. Hmm.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.102
He was real sick,

35:39.104 --> 35:41.705
and
little funny in the head.

35:48.147 --> 35:49.846
See that spot right there?

36:02.060 --> 36:04.327
That's Jimmy's blood.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.564
He threw it up
when he got denied.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.570
Guess he needed that real bad.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.775
Said he was seeing shit.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.345
Like, some real crazy shit.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.654
Did he tell you what he saw?

36:35.761 --> 36:36.960
No.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.931
But I really
wouldn't wanna know.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.234
Would you?

36:49.107 --> 36:50.807
Where is this place?

37:03.188 --> 37:04.788
Tell him Skaggs sent you.

38:50.595 --> 38:51.928
Hello?

39:59.998 --> 40:02.866
What the fuck you think
you're doing in my house, huh?

40:06.538 --> 40:08.972
Oh, hey, man. Uh...

40:08.974 --> 40:10.440
I, uh...

40:10.442 --> 40:11.708
I got a piece of paper.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.777
- You got a piece of paper.
- Yeah.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.246
Huh? Well,
pull it out. Show me.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.581
Show me your piece of paper.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.884
Ah. Hold on. Yeah.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.886
- Huh.
- It's...

40:22.888 --> 40:25.188
I had it right fucking...

40:26.158 --> 40:29.492
I had it right fucking...

40:30.662 --> 40:34.531
See, uh,
your name's Eagle, right?

40:34.533 --> 40:37.667
Skaggs sent me over here.
I met him at the hospital.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.035
He told me about
his brother Jimmy.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.638
He said I could buy
some methadone off of you.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.839
Jimmy.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.442
That piece of shit.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.745
Jimmy

40:48.747 --> 40:51.448
has entirely too much
going on up here.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.553
Huh? A little too much
junkie business.

40:59.224 --> 41:02.559
You wouldn't want that to
happen to you now, would you?

41:04.062 --> 41:07.230
- No, no, no.
- No. No.

41:08.033 --> 41:09.566
No.

41:10.602 --> 41:11.835
No.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.771
No. I didn't think so.

41:14.773 --> 41:18.374
You know,
people swear that Jimmy

41:18.376 --> 41:23.213
could see himself descending
into the lower levels of hell.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.383
But you? Goddamn, boy.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.852
You look like
you've been there.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.920
You know,
as a matter of fact,

41:30.922 --> 41:33.556
you look like
you're still there.

41:33.558 --> 41:36.526
Yeah.
Let me tell you something.

41:36.528 --> 41:39.295
I have no need for you
or your business.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.765
So, you get the fuck out of here
before you burn a hole in this spot,

41:42.767 --> 41:44.501
- you got me?
- No, listen, man.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.769
I'll buy some methadone
off of you. 100 bucks, man.

41:46.771 --> 41:48.771
All right? And
I'll give you $100.

41:53.211 --> 41:54.944
$500.

41:56.848 --> 41:59.182
I don't have
that kind of cash on me.

42:02.153 --> 42:05.822
Sure you do. So reach
into your little pocket,

42:05.824 --> 42:08.825
pull it out,
and put it in my hand.

42:08.827 --> 42:12.562
You place that right here,
and we got a deal.

42:12.564 --> 42:14.531
I will hook you the fuck up.

42:14.533 --> 42:15.765
But if you don't,

42:15.767 --> 42:17.834
I'ma castrate you
and feed you your own bits...

42:17.836 --> 42:20.436
All right, man. Calm down.
Calm down. I got the money.

42:20.438 --> 42:23.172
It's right here.
Here. Look here.

42:24.543 --> 42:27.777
See that? That's all I got.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.979
That's all...
That's all, all here.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.452
All right. I'll hook you up.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.021
Go on. After you.

42:39.157 --> 42:41.257
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

42:42.494 --> 42:44.160
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

42:54.339 --> 42:55.838
Thanks a lot, man.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.308
Jamie.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.050
What do you think Jamie saw?

43:42.554 --> 43:45.755
Must've been something
really fucked up.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.892
Oh, yes, because...

43:49.894 --> 43:53.563
Oh, you're about
to find out first-hand.

44:34.205 --> 44:35.238
Dad.

44:47.052 --> 44:47.917
Morning, Johnny.

44:51.690 --> 44:54.023
Do you want me
to change your sheets?

45:04.769 --> 45:07.170
You came in
pretty late last night.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.973
Rough night?

45:32.597 --> 45:33.996
Johnny.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.233
I ain't gonna lie,

45:37.969 --> 45:40.136
but I have to let you know.

45:41.773 --> 45:43.473
I know this is dumb.

45:44.943 --> 45:46.576
Stupid.

45:46.578 --> 45:49.112
You probably get this
all the time, but...

45:50.982 --> 45:52.915
You're Johnny Thunders.

45:53.685 --> 45:55.318
The New York Dolls.

45:56.621 --> 45:59.122
I recognized you
the second I saw you.

46:02.026 --> 46:04.861
It's a shame that band
had to end so quickly, but...

46:08.500 --> 46:10.767
I know that hasn't stopped you.

46:13.972 --> 46:16.239
I'm glad you like the band.

46:19.644 --> 46:21.344
That's good.

46:22.714 --> 46:24.080
That's good.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.853
I saw my drummer.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.857
His name was Billy.

46:36.027 --> 46:39.162
He died of an overdose
back in '72.

46:56.681 --> 46:58.314
You don't understand.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.084
This ride,

47:03.721 --> 47:05.922
it comes at a price.

47:07.392 --> 47:11.327
And Billy bought himself a one-way
ticket, and he never came back.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.898
When he overdosed,
the guys he was getting loaded with,

47:15.900 --> 47:19.035
they put him in a bathtub
and they force-fed him coffee.

47:20.405 --> 47:23.306
They tried to wake him up,
but he choked to death.

47:27.612 --> 47:30.246
You get no respect
until you're dead.

47:32.617 --> 47:34.183
Oh, well...

47:36.221 --> 47:40.122
He kind of
tasted the life, Billy.

47:42.827 --> 47:45.194
But this kind of
lifestyle killed him.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.333
I saw his ghost in there.

47:55.039 --> 47:57.473
And I think he's trying
to tell me something.

48:01.112 --> 48:03.913
Fuck!
All my shit's gone.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.634
How am I gonna get back?

48:08.635 --> 48:10.852
How am I supposed
to get better if my medicine...

48:10.855 --> 48:13.689
I'm sure
you're going to be just fine.

48:16.494 --> 48:18.494
My wife left me, Iris.

48:20.865 --> 48:23.366
She took the kids
away from me.

48:23.368 --> 48:25.434
And it was all my fault.

48:25.436 --> 48:27.570
Hey, look...

48:29.807 --> 48:32.074
Why don't you
just go see them?

48:33.745 --> 48:35.111
I can't.

48:37.715 --> 48:41.217
I can't. They won't let me.

48:41.219 --> 48:44.353
Not until I get clean.
Not until I get better.

48:45.623 --> 48:46.989
I gotta get better.

48:46.991 --> 48:48.925
That's why I came here.
I gotta get better.

48:48.927 --> 48:50.526
I need to heal.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.099
Music heals.

49:22.860 --> 49:25.628
This thing looks like
it could use some love.

49:34.038 --> 49:36.372
It's always helped you
before, hasn't it?

50:03.768 --> 50:05.368
Ms. Alexander...

50:08.539 --> 50:11.240
Did they tell you
what happened to her?

50:11.242 --> 50:13.409
Ms. Alexander died last night.

50:14.579 --> 50:17.179
Her folks are coming
to collect her belongings.

50:40.638 --> 50:42.238
Did I get any calls?

50:43.674 --> 50:44.774
Nope.

50:48.212 --> 50:51.213
Send the bell cart
up to my room.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.815
It's time for me to check out.

50:53.217 --> 50:54.650
So soon.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.085
That's unfortunate.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.687
It's cool, man.

51:02.827 --> 51:04.393
$60 even.

51:05.630 --> 51:06.762
All right.

51:19.744 --> 51:21.243
Sir?

51:21.245 --> 51:22.344
Uh...

51:23.648 --> 51:24.780
You know what?

51:25.683 --> 51:27.550
I was thinking, uh...

51:29.487 --> 51:32.755
I was thinking maybe I should
stay one more night, you know.

51:34.092 --> 51:36.859
Thanks, thanks a lot.

51:36.861 --> 51:38.627
Yeah. Just one more night.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.397
Sir? Sir?

52:27.245 --> 52:30.179
That sounds great, Johnny.
That is what I'm talking about.

52:30.181 --> 52:32.281
It's magic, brother.

52:32.283 --> 52:33.649
I get to listen to it
every day.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.885
I can't believe
I get paid to do it.

52:39.490 --> 52:43.225
Hey, man, I'm gonna play back
your mix right in your headphones.

52:43.227 --> 52:44.560
So you can
get fresh with it.

52:44.562 --> 52:47.496
And we'll record
once you're feeling it.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.331
So, go ahead
and take a listen.

53:03.247 --> 53:04.413
Can you turn it up, man?

53:04.415 --> 53:07.016
I'm not getting anything
on my end at all.

53:07.018 --> 53:08.450
Is this thing on?

53:09.453 --> 53:12.288
I said turn it up.
I can't hear it.

53:12.290 --> 53:13.856
I got you solid, man.

53:46.023 --> 53:48.290
Sorry, man.
Was that too loud?

53:49.160 --> 53:50.826
Ah, something's wrong.

53:52.663 --> 53:53.729
Uh...

53:57.568 --> 53:59.835
Can you try it out
on your end?

54:00.738 --> 54:03.305
I got nothing on my end,
man. I mean...

54:03.307 --> 54:05.708
Give me a second, okay?

54:21.158 --> 54:24.393
You're okay. You're okay.

54:32.303 --> 54:33.535
Cliff, my man.

54:33.537 --> 54:36.305
- Oh, Tony, how's it going?
- Good. And you?

54:36.307 --> 54:37.673
Pretty good, pretty good.

54:37.675 --> 54:38.874
Thank you so much.

54:38.876 --> 54:41.310
I just wanted to thank you
for bringing him in.

54:41.312 --> 54:43.145
- You know, he's a great dude, I gotta say.
- Yeah.

54:43.147 --> 54:45.514
But I mean, you know,
before all the New York Dolls stuff,

54:45.516 --> 54:47.883
I mean, he's... Aside from all
that New York Dolls stuff, man,

54:47.885 --> 54:50.219
he was doing all these
different side projects.

54:50.221 --> 54:51.553
He's been
working his ass off.

54:51.555 --> 54:53.722
I mean, this guy's gonna be
the next Keith Richards.

55:12.276 --> 55:13.676
Hey, man,
while you're in there,

55:13.678 --> 55:16.912
can you give me a guitar check?
Just a couple of chords.

55:28.726 --> 55:31.760
Can you give me that again?
Just one more chord.

55:35.733 --> 55:36.699
You know what?

55:36.701 --> 55:38.500
I'm gonna bring you
another guitar.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.636
It sounds like there's
something in the body.

55:55.820 --> 55:56.919
Oh.

55:58.923 --> 56:00.389
Really?

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:43.442
Hey!

01:02:43.443 --> 01:02:45.494
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to be in here.

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:47.863
Uh... sorry.
I'll just leave.

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:49.397
How did you
get in this room?

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:53.301
Calm down, man. Okay? Calm down.
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:54.603
No, no. Hold on.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:01.109
Weren't you here earlier?

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.246
Yeah.

01:03:05.048 --> 01:03:07.449
Your name is Frank, right?

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.251
Frank?

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:11.987
Uh... Yeah, yeah. Uh...

01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:14.022
Yeah, I was...

01:03:14.024 --> 01:03:16.224
I guess I made a wrong turn
a couple of doors down

01:03:16.226 --> 01:03:19.461
and ended up here.
So, I thought I'd just, uh,

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:23.031
grab my medicine and check
in with you guys later.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:25.333
Follow me. I'll take
a look at your file,

01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:27.602
get your medicine,
send you on your way.

01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:29.337
Listen, I need
my medicine now.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:33.175
Yes, understood.
But I'm going to look at you first.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.243
You'll be out
of here in no time.

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:37.379
Follow me...

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:48.356
All righty. You just
sit tight right there, buddy.

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:51.493
A little while longer and
we'll get you your medicine.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:54.196
Thanks, thanks a lot.
Thank you.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:06.041
This looks like leukemia.
Have you been checked?

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:11.346
Uh, I just had
a rough night last night.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:16.184
Hmm. Certain illnesses
follow certain patterns.

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:19.321
Body tends to bruise,

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.623
and has trouble healing.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:26.661
About this methadone,
when did you have your last dose?

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:28.063
Too long.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:30.332
Way too long.
I'm seeing things.

01:04:31.335 --> 01:04:33.935
- Hallucinations?
- Yeah.

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:38.073
Methadone withdrawal
doesn't cause hallucinations.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:40.876
That would be
a hallucinogenic drug.

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:42.510
Have you been
taking hallucinogens?

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:45.046
No, I swear. I swear.
I haven't been taking them.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.082
I hate hallucinogens.

01:04:48.685 --> 01:04:50.185
Well...

01:04:51.722 --> 01:04:53.455
I want you to feel better.

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:00.362
This will help.

01:05:02.466 --> 01:05:05.166
No, you need to sign this.

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:15.243
Well...

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:18.213
You know, some people
just don't listen.

01:05:18.215 --> 01:05:20.515
Take that piece
of shit right there.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.684
Now, I know for a fact

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:25.253
I told him
that if he fucked me,

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.656
I was gonna turn
his head into a canoe.

01:05:27.658 --> 01:05:31.593
And I'll be goddamned, ain't
that exactly what happened?

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.894
You know what?

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:36.364
You are one lucky son of a bitch.
You know that?

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:38.300
'Cause if I hadn't
killed that piece of shit,

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:40.502
you might've done
some business with him.

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:41.970
Get up...

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:45.674
Does this bother you?

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:49.144
Here. I'ma put this
over here. See?

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:51.980
All gentle-like. Chill out.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:54.649
We had a real
good time last time, right?

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.518
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.320
- Yeah.
- Didn't we?

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:02.290
Yeah. Yeah, we had...
We had a really good time.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.426
- We had a great time.
- We had a great time.

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.661
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:10.198
We had a great time.
Hey, uh...

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.034
Yeah. I think
I'm gonna bounce.

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:16.304
Whoa! Slow your roll there,
lookie-loo.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:19.741
- Oh, no...
- Give me the fucking thing!

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:22.277
I just wanna see it. Right?

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:23.645
Let me see
what you got here.

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:26.448
Man.

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:29.351
You want some of this?

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:34.923
It would be a crying shame
if you leave all empty-handed.

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:37.659
Man, you were so close.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.527
I bet you can taste it.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:42.998
You can smell it,
can't you? Want it? Ah!

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.501
Tell you what?
All you have to do is pay the price.

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:48.636
How much do you want?

01:06:48.638 --> 01:06:50.205
Now, that's cute, rock star.

01:06:50.207 --> 01:06:53.508
I'm gonna say the second verse
as the same as the first.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.410
And that is $500.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:57.946
I don't have
any money on me, man.

01:06:57.948 --> 01:07:00.115
- Are you lying to me, man?
- No. No.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.750
You got it on you?

01:07:01.752 --> 01:07:03.551
Hold on. I think, uh...

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:06.855
I think I got $100
down here somewhere.

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.356
Uh... One sec.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.092
Uh, let me
just see if I, uh...

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.376
Are you doing me dirty?

01:07:28.678 --> 01:07:29.677
Huh?

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:33.214
You know, I like you.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.483
So I'ma tell you this
just one time.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:38.953
Go fuck yourself, rock star.

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:41.322
Huh? 'Cause you know
what I'm gonna do?

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:43.391
I'ma take that pistol from you,

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.360
and I'm gonna
fuck you in the ass.

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:47.662
Fuck you in the ass,
hard and deep.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:50.098
Go fuck yourself! Fuck you!

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.200
You goddamn piece of shit!

01:08:06.316 --> 01:08:08.817
Come back here,
you fucking pussy!

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:12.520
Where the fuck are you,
you fucking piece of shit?

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:14.155
Johnny!

01:08:15.025 --> 01:08:16.925
Johnny!

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.893
Where you hiding, faggot?

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:21.395
I'ma fuck you
in your ass, boy.

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.163
You hear me?

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:25.433
Goddamn piece of shit!

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:30.004
Oh. You know, you're just
making it harder on yourself,

01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:32.273
you fucking parasite.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.777
You hear that?

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.647
Fuck. Fuck.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.050
Fuck! Come out, John!

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.085
Where are you, goddamn pussy?

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.587
Don't make me find you.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:48.223
Don't make me!

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.694
Where's the money, John?
Where is it?

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:30.532
Where the fuck are you?

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:05.266
I'm gonna get you,
you fucking piece of shit!

01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:42.250
Fuck! Johnny!

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.118
Johnny!

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.703
I feel like death
is trying to take me.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.913
My mind's fading away.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.685
You're not.

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:21.155
You're not losing your mind.

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:24.091
Do you ever have a dream

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.863
where it feels so real,

01:14:29.899 --> 01:14:32.099
and you just keep
trying to wake up.

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:36.704
But the harder how you try,

01:14:36.706 --> 01:14:40.675
the deeper and deeper you fall
into sleep until you just...

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.912
Our whole lives are a dream.

01:14:46.449 --> 01:14:48.149
Then we die.

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:52.487
But you're gonna be just fine.

01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:03.598
Have you seen anything

01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:06.734
strange around here?

01:15:07.437 --> 01:15:09.737
Just anything out of,

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:12.273
out of the ordinary?

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:16.878
This whole town is evil.

01:15:18.147 --> 01:15:21.916
Aside from all the colorful
Mardi Gras and stuff.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:26.120
It has a dark past.

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:33.060
Some say the spirits of the
dead still live on in the city.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.063
Never did
move on, so...

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.767
Yes, Johnny.

01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:46.307
I have seen my fair share of
things that can't be explained.

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:53.748
I saw a spirit
in here last night.

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:58.219
What'd you see?

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.823
I watch the front desk,

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.827
<i>so I was in the lobby
all by myself.</i>

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:20.074
<i>But last night,</i>

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:25.179
<i>this figure came
from the end of the hall.</i>

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.114
<i>But it just</i>

01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:30.418
<i>stood there.</i>

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.055
<i>It was like it was looking at
me through the frosted glass.</i>

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.858
How did you know
it was a spirit?

01:16:41.397 --> 01:16:43.030
My friend, Namira.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.633
She's a palm reader.

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:48.769
She's into
all that voodoo stuff.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:52.039
She gave me her palm deck.

01:17:00.617 --> 01:17:02.383
This is what I saw.

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:16.230
Hey...

01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:20.134
Hey, it was probably just there because Ms.
Alexander passed away last night.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.103
You're gonna be okay.

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:29.310
Ms. Alexander...

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:33.848
how did she die?

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:40.855
They found her in her bathtub.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:45.926
She must've
fallen asleep and died.

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.332
But you are gonna be just fine.

01:17:54.203 --> 01:17:55.803
Yeah?

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:01.042
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

01:18:17.093 --> 01:18:19.060
Who is it?

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:20.928
The name's Johnny.

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:23.998
What do you want?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.534
I don't have any
further appointments today.

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:28.536
And I don't accept walk-ins.

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:29.770
I'm sorry,

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:31.839
but you're gonna have
to come back another day.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.308
Listen, I got nowhere else
to go, all right?

01:18:34.777 --> 01:18:36.444
Iris sent me here.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.013
Uh... Who?

01:18:39.015 --> 01:18:41.148
My friend, Iris.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:50.958
I've been close to death
many a time, Johnny.

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.127
In some cases,

01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:57.264
I stare right into the eyes
of demons themselves.

01:18:57.266 --> 01:18:59.200
I can sense death

01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:03.270
as clear as you
coming into this room.

01:19:04.207 --> 01:19:08.342
It is best, Johnny,
if we seek your future,

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:10.277
not your past.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.615
The hanged man.

01:19:14.617 --> 01:19:18.185
The old must die
to replace the new, Johnny.

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:22.022
And there will be
a change in your future,

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:23.858
for the best,

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.127
or for the worst.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:28.963
You collapse.

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:34.201
This will be painful, Johnny.

01:19:35.571 --> 01:19:37.438
What is this?

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:48.983
The end of something.

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:51.252
But what?

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:56.157
I think he is already here.

01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:58.425
At the end of the road.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:01.996
Waiting for me.

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:06.066
You will continue
down a deep path

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:10.004
that will twist and turn
at every corner,

01:20:10.006 --> 01:20:13.474
which will ultimately
lead to no escape.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:16.477
To a bear trap, Johnny.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:23.851
Fueled by
your addictive desires.

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:35.529
The cup of five.

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:39.099
What are you trying to say here?
I have a drinking problem or something?

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:41.202
Is that what this is about?

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:45.573
Dealing with loss, Johnny.

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:48.242
Oh, so what? You're saying
I have a drinking problem?

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:49.910
You're saying I'm gonna
drink myself to death, huh?

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:53.447
That's what you're saying. to me?
That's what this is all about, huh?

01:20:53.449 --> 01:20:56.717
You misunderstand, Johnny.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:58.419
I barely had anything to drink

01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:01.856
since I flew into this joint
to begin with, all right?

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:19.373
The drink.

01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:22.009
Guy bought you a drink.

01:21:22.745 --> 01:21:24.612
Says he's your biggest fan.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.067
"Give a man a mask,

01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:38.806
"and he will
show you his true face."

01:24:45.448 --> 01:24:47.481
Thanks for a hell
of an escape too.

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:51.618
I just step out on that street

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.521
and ride in with
all the other carnival freaks.

01:24:58.694 --> 01:24:59.827
Hmm.

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.729
Hallucinate much?

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:13.774
<i>Lysergic acid</i>

01:25:14.677 --> 01:25:16.510
<i>diethylamide.</i>

01:25:17.847 --> 01:25:22.382
<i>LSD.</i>

01:25:28.224 --> 01:25:30.124
Guy bought you a drink.

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:32.826
Says he's your biggest fan.

01:25:36.665 --> 01:25:38.665
Why did you do this to me?

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:46.740
Man...

01:25:46.742 --> 01:25:51.378
Can't believe I saw you
out back in that hospital.

01:25:53.215 --> 01:25:54.848
You got Eagle killed.

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.584
And you killed Ms. Alexander.

01:25:57.586 --> 01:25:59.653
Hmm. Grandma?

01:26:03.859 --> 01:26:07.661
We just left her alone
for a little while. She just

01:26:08.731 --> 01:26:10.397
simply slipped away.

01:26:14.303 --> 01:26:16.236
Where's the money?

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:20.941
What are you talking about?

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.446
I know who you are.

01:26:27.483 --> 01:26:30.384
Grandma said you had
a shit ton of money.

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:35.589
You fuck up, where is it?

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.092
I know who you are.

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:42.596
You're Johnny Thunders,
the rock 'n roller.

01:26:43.832 --> 01:26:47.367
The lifestyle, the drugs,

01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:49.803
the fame.

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:52.839
You don't know me...

01:26:52.841 --> 01:26:55.275
What happened to that Johnny Thunder fame?
You throw it away?

01:26:57.313 --> 01:26:59.112
What happened to that
Johnny Thunder money?

01:26:59.114 --> 01:27:00.847
She took it.

01:27:04.787 --> 01:27:06.286
Who?

01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:09.423
- Your grandma.
- Motherfucker!

01:27:09.425 --> 01:27:13.827
Where is it?
Where the fuck is it?

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:15.229
I don't know.

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:18.799
I live in a fucking shack!

01:27:18.801 --> 01:27:20.968
Where the fuck is the money?

01:28:01.677 --> 01:28:03.543
<i>Dad.</i>

01:28:05.681 --> 01:28:06.780
Jamie.

01:28:13.222 --> 01:28:14.855
Where are you?

01:28:24.033 --> 01:28:26.233
Where are you?
Where are you?

01:28:26.235 --> 01:28:30.504
Where are...
