01:10.750 --> 01:12.735
60 knots? No way, Barnes.

01:12.835 --> 01:15.257
The Reds don't have anything that fast.

01:15.357 --> 01:18.778
Checked it twice. I mean,
it's a real unique signature.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.536
No cavitation. No reactor noise.

01:21.636 --> 01:23.780
It doesn't even sound like screws.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.541
What the hell is it?

01:35.390 --> 01:39.296
I'll tell you what it's not.
It's not one of ours.

01:39.396 --> 01:41.577
Sir, contact changing to heading

01:41.677 --> 01:42.677
214.

01:43.755 --> 01:44.955
Speed,

01:45.835 --> 01:47.635
80 knots.

01:48.670 --> 01:50.470
80 knots.

01:50.798 --> 01:52.940
Still diving. Depth 900 feet.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.655
Still diving. Depth 900 feet.

01:55.755 --> 01:58.778
Port clearance 150 feet from the cliff wall, sir.

01:58.878 --> 02:01.254
It's getting tight in here.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.697
We can still give him a haircut.

02:03.797 --> 02:06.659
Helm, come right to... 069.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.735
Down five degrees.

02:08.835 --> 02:11.134
Coming right 069. Down five degrees. Aye.

02:11.234 --> 02:13.976
Port side clearance 120 feet. Narrowing 75.

02:14.076 --> 02:16.497
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.

02:16.597 --> 02:18.974
It's too damn close! We gotta back off.

02:19.074 --> 02:21.098
Sir, range to contact 200.

02:21.198 --> 02:24.785
Contact just jinked to bearing 260
and accelerated to...

02:26.150 --> 02:28.135
to 130 knots, sir.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.698
Nothin' goes 130.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.576
Sir, range to contact 100 yards.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.655
80 yards, sir!

02:36.755 --> 02:37.755
60!

02:49.030 --> 02:51.255
It's turbulence! We're in its wake!

02:51.355 --> 02:53.495
Helm, all stop! Full right rudder.

02:53.595 --> 02:56.778
Hydraulic failure. Planes not responding, sir.

02:56.878 --> 02:59.739
Auxiliary power. Monitors back.

02:59.839 --> 03:02.469
Hydraulics restored, sir.

03:05.230 --> 03:06.663
Oh, my God!

03:09.950 --> 03:11.178
Fire in sonar!

03:12.190 --> 03:14.704
Collision alarm!

03:16.670 --> 03:18.547
Fire control to sonar!

03:22.230 --> 03:24.614
Let's get outta here!

03:24.714 --> 03:28.217
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Port torpedo room is flooded, sir!

03:28.317 --> 03:32.189
Blow all tanks!
Blow all the tanks! Blow everything!

03:35.870 --> 03:37.855
All back full!

03:37.955 --> 03:39.818
Answering, all back full!

03:39.918 --> 03:42.378
Give me a damage report! What's our depth?

03:44.750 --> 03:47.017
Passing 1400, sir.

03:47.117 --> 03:49.175
Main forward tanks are ruptured!

03:49.275 --> 03:51.058
Still descending, sir!

03:51.158 --> 03:52.158
1450.

03:56.550 --> 03:58.615
Passing 1500, sir.

03:58.715 --> 04:01.094
Still descending.

04:01.194 --> 04:04.857
- We're too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1550. Still descending.

04:04.957 --> 04:08.175
- We're losin' her!
- Passing 1600, sir,

04:08.275 --> 04:10.899
- and still descending!
- Launch the buoy.

04:10.999 --> 04:12.815
Passing 1650.

04:12.915 --> 04:14.866
- Passing 1700, sir.
- Launching!

04:30.150 --> 04:32.141
Come on! Give me your hand!

04:33.430 --> 04:35.227
Get the door closed!

05:08.948 --> 05:11.498
Benthic Explorer, Salvor One on final. Over.

05:11.598 --> 05:14.217
Copy you, Salvor One.
This is Benthic Explorer.

05:14.317 --> 05:16.293
You're cleared to land.

05:16.393 --> 05:18.856
Hey! They're coming.

05:26.708 --> 05:28.853
This... could get pretty ugly.

05:28.953 --> 05:29.953
Yeah.

05:30.394 --> 05:32.379
Does not look good at all.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.654
Oh, no. Look who's with them.

06:08.754 --> 06:10.101
The queen bitch of the universe.

06:12.507 --> 06:13.816
Sonny, how you doin'?

06:13.916 --> 06:16.573
I've got two more welds on this bypass valve.

06:16.673 --> 06:18.652
No light from the surface.

06:18.752 --> 06:20.934
- How deep are they?
- McBride?

06:21.034 --> 06:23.012
1700 feet.

06:23.112 --> 06:26.816
- I need them to go below 2,000.
- No problem. They can do that.

06:27.547 --> 06:33.215
So that's it? You just cheerfully turn
the whole thing over to the goon squad?

06:33.315 --> 06:36.299
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I'm cooperating.

06:37.427 --> 06:39.492
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

06:39.592 --> 06:41.572
Get Brigman on the line.

06:41.672 --> 06:43.652
Deepcore, this is Benthic.

06:43.752 --> 06:45.732
Man, if Bud goes along with this,

06:45.832 --> 06:49.095
they're gonna have to shoot her
with a tranquilliser gun.

06:49.195 --> 06:50.666
- Roger.
- Hippy, get me Bud.

06:58.827 --> 07:02.936
Catfish, get them old bones up here
and give me a hand.

07:03.036 --> 07:05.257
Hang on. I'll be up there in a second.

07:10.547 --> 07:12.692
Hey, you guys are milkin' that job.

07:12.792 --> 07:17.534
Yeah, it's just because we love freezing
our butts off out here for you so much.

07:17.634 --> 07:19.618
Bring me another hammer!

07:23.904 --> 07:25.889
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah!

07:25.989 --> 07:27.969
Hippy's on the bitch box!

07:28.069 --> 07:30.970
It's a call from topside.
That new company man.

07:31.070 --> 07:32.533
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.652
That guy don't know his butt from a rathole.

07:35.752 --> 07:39.613
Perry, square away this mud hose
and get rid of some of these empty sacks.

07:39.713 --> 07:43.413
- It's starting to look like my apartment.
- You got it, boss!

07:45.824 --> 07:49.049
- Bud, pick up the topside line. Urgent.
- I'm coming!

07:49.149 --> 07:51.977
I'm coming! Jesus! Keep your pantyhose on!

07:58.703 --> 08:01.050
Brigman here.

08:01.150 --> 08:03.527
Yeah, Kirkhill. What's goin' on?

08:03.627 --> 08:05.608
Yeah, I'm calm.

08:05.708 --> 08:09.582
I'm a calm person. Is there some reason
why I shouldn't be calm?

08:13.903 --> 08:14.903
What?

08:19.103 --> 08:21.094
I am on last feed now.

08:24.943 --> 08:29.175
Can you get that goddamn hippy shit music
off the comm line, please?

08:34.823 --> 08:37.330
I'm almost done with the shut-off valve.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.611
Sonny, I'm right behind you
with the next fitting.

08:40.711 --> 08:42.693
Hang on a second.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.208
- OK, give it to me.
- Here you go.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.895
Thanks, sweetie.

08:52.663 --> 08:56.451
All divers, drop what you're doin'.
Everybody out of the pool.

08:57.583 --> 09:01.287
I mean everybody right now.
Sonny, One Night, let's go.

09:01.387 --> 09:04.012
Damn it. We just got out here.

09:04.112 --> 09:06.742
There was a time when I woulda asked why.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.701
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!

09:18.463 --> 09:22.290
Deepcore, Deepcore.
This is Flatbed preparing to surface.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.374
Roger, Flatbed. Come on up.

09:25.543 --> 09:28.651
All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool.

09:28.751 --> 09:31.462
Everybody get to sub-bay. ASAP.

09:35.383 --> 09:37.374
Come on. Let's get his hat off.

09:38.183 --> 09:40.408
- Take it off.
- What the hell's goin' on?

09:40.508 --> 09:43.329
- How come we got recalled?
- The hell if I know.

09:43.429 --> 09:45.229
I got it.

09:45.508 --> 09:49.489
- What's the drift, pardner? Why are we up?
- Just follow standard procedure.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.292
Flog your dog till somebody
tells you what's happenin'.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.578
- What's the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!

09:56.103 --> 09:59.690
We just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.

09:59.790 --> 10:01.768
- Oh, shit!
- What?

10:01.868 --> 10:06.850
We've received an invitation to, um,
cooperate in a matter of national security.

10:06.950 --> 10:08.928
Now you know as much as I do.

10:09.028 --> 10:12.567
Get your gear off and get to control.
We've got a briefing in ten minutes.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.667
Come on! Let's move it!

10:14.703 --> 10:18.168
At 0922 local time today
an American nuclear submarine,

10:18.268 --> 10:21.221
the USS Montana,
with 156 men aboard, went down

10:23.141 --> 10:24.328
- about 22 miles from here.
- Damn!

10:24.428 --> 10:29.046
There's been no contact with the sub since
then. The cause of the incident is not known.

10:29.146 --> 10:32.606
Your company has authorised
the navy's use of this facility

10:32.706 --> 10:36.687
for a rescue operation
code-named Operation Salvor.

10:36.787 --> 10:40.166
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No. We know where it is.

10:40.266 --> 10:43.289
But she's in 2,000 feet of water
and we can't reach her.

10:43.389 --> 10:46.888
We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors... if any.

10:46.988 --> 10:49.126
Don't you have your own stuff for this?

10:49.226 --> 10:52.446
By the time we get our submersibles here,
the storm'll be on us.

10:52.546 --> 10:56.527
You can get your rig in and be on site
in 15 hours. That makes you our best option.

10:56.627 --> 10:59.729
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

10:59.829 --> 11:03.249
I have been authorised
to offer you all special bonuses

11:03.349 --> 11:05.928
equivalent to three times normal dive pay.

11:06.028 --> 11:07.846
Yes, sir, buddy!

11:07.946 --> 11:09.926
For triple time, I'd eat Beany!

11:10.026 --> 11:12.571
Set me on fire
and put me out with horse piss.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.567
I don't know what kind of deal
you made with the company,

11:15.667 --> 11:19.126
but my people are not qualified for this.
We're oil workers.

11:19.226 --> 11:21.808
Shut up! Hold it down.

11:21.908 --> 11:23.886
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

11:23.986 --> 11:27.728
He will transfer down to you with
a SEAL team and supervise the operation.

11:27.828 --> 11:30.887
Send down whoever you like,
but I'm the tool pusher on this rig.

11:30.987 --> 11:34.366
When it comes to the safety of these people,
there's me and then God.

11:34.466 --> 11:36.765
Understand? If things get dicey,

11:36.865 --> 11:38.852
I'm pulling the plug.

11:40.061 --> 11:43.169
I think we're all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.412
Now, let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?

12:16.419 --> 12:19.456
Let's take it about five degrees left, all right?

12:20.659 --> 12:23.093
Roger. Five degrees left, Bud.

12:30.419 --> 12:34.246
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when the leading edge will hit.

12:34.346 --> 12:37.564
Well, it's official.
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick.

12:37.664 --> 12:39.963
And it's gonna be making our lives

12:40.063 --> 12:43.284
- real interesting in a few hours.
- Fred?

12:43.384 --> 12:47.088
I don't know, man. I think hurricanes
should be named after women, don't you?

12:54.779 --> 12:57.967
- I can't believe you're letting them do this.
- Hi, Lins!

12:58.067 --> 13:00.698
I thought you were in Houston.

13:01.219 --> 13:03.204
I was. Now I'm here.

13:03.304 --> 13:07.003
- Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn't up to me.

13:07.103 --> 13:11.085
We were that close to proving
a submersible drilling platform could work.

13:11.185 --> 13:14.367
- I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?

13:14.467 --> 13:17.487
- I designed the damn thing.
- Benthic Petroleum paid for it.

13:17.587 --> 13:21.007
So as long as they're holding the pink slip,
I go where they tell me.

13:21.107 --> 13:25.846
I had a lot riding on this. They bought you,
didn't they? More like rented you cheap!

13:25.946 --> 13:27.924
I'm switchin' off now.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.126
Bye-bye.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.886
Oh, OK. Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight!

13:32.986 --> 13:34.586
Bye-bye.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.464
Virgil?

13:38.699 --> 13:40.690
God, I hate that bitch!

13:42.299 --> 13:45.336
Probably shouldn't have married her,
then, huh?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.570
Get it stable!

13:55.819 --> 13:57.889
Cab 3. You're clear to launch.

14:00.499 --> 14:02.091
Hang on, gentlemen.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.929
Touchdown! Crowd goes wild!

14:12.139 --> 14:14.805
Explorer, this is Cab 3. We are styling.

14:14.905 --> 14:17.891
- How you boys doin' back there?
- Great.

14:20.218 --> 14:24.763
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.

14:24.863 --> 14:28.931
- Roger that, Cab 3. Good luck.
- Luck is not a factor.

14:37.338 --> 14:41.527
- Hey, One Night. How you doin'?
- I got a white line fever, baby.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.210
Yeah, I heard that.

15:59.138 --> 16:01.123
Deepcore, Deepcore.

16:01.223 --> 16:06.407
- This is Cab 3 on final approach.
- Roger, Cab 3. Is that you, Lindsey?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.707
None other.

16:10.618 --> 16:12.018
Oh, no!

16:32.218 --> 16:33.607
Howdy, boys!

16:33.707 --> 16:35.683
Hey, Lindsey!

16:35.783 --> 16:37.763
I'll be damned!

16:37.863 --> 16:41.328
Y'all shouldn't be down here, sweet thing.
You might ruin your stockings.

16:45.538 --> 16:49.322
The bad news is we got eight hours
in this can blowin' down.

16:49.422 --> 16:52.846
And the worse news is
it's gonna take us three weeks

16:52.946 --> 16:56.286
- to decompress later.
- We've all been fully briefed, Mrs Brigman.

16:56.386 --> 16:58.733
Just don't call me that, OK? I hate that.

17:01.058 --> 17:04.044
All right. What would you like us to call you?

17:04.144 --> 17:05.144
Sir?

17:08.938 --> 17:10.923
There we go!

17:11.022 --> 17:13.327
Y'all start equalisin'... now!

17:17.617 --> 17:20.247
Let's watch each other closely
for signs of HPNS.

17:20.347 --> 17:24.324
High pressure nervous syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.

17:24.424 --> 17:26.801
- Nausea, excitability...
- Disorientation.

17:26.902 --> 17:29.173
And a partridge in a pear tree.

17:31.058 --> 17:35.327
About one person in 20 can't handle it.
They just go buggo.

17:35.427 --> 17:37.882
Look, they've all made runs to this depth.

17:37.982 --> 17:40.203
- They checked out.
- I understand that.

17:40.303 --> 17:42.848
What I'm saying is it's impossible to predict

17:42.948 --> 17:45.930
- just who's susceptible.
- They checked out.

17:48.338 --> 17:50.323
- These guys the SEALs?
- Yeah.

17:50.423 --> 17:54.367
Those guys ain't so tough.
I've fought guys plenty tougher than them.

17:54.467 --> 17:57.965
Now we get to hear
how you could have been a contender?

17:58.065 --> 17:59.065
Hey!

17:59.584 --> 18:01.686
- You see this?
- Yeah.

18:01.786 --> 18:03.734
They used to call this the hammer.

18:12.738 --> 18:15.527
Y'all done to a turn and ready to serve.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.609
Everybody OK?

18:21.418 --> 18:23.685
- They're really very sweet.
- Yeah.

18:23.785 --> 18:27.365
Hey! I don't remember putting a wall here.
How you doin', Jammer?

18:27.465 --> 18:30.097
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I'm OK.

18:37.378 --> 18:39.363
I want a full check on their gear.

18:39.463 --> 18:42.973
These guys are about as much fun
as a tax audit.

18:58.496 --> 19:01.242
Hippy, you're gonna give that rat a disease.

19:01.342 --> 19:03.142
Hi, Lins!

19:05.896 --> 19:07.881
Well, well. Mrs Brigman.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.967
Not for long.

19:12.976 --> 19:15.809
You never did like being called that, did you?

19:17.096 --> 19:19.166
Not even when it meant something.

19:20.896 --> 19:24.605
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi.

19:25.856 --> 19:29.292
- Hey, One Night. It's Lindsey.
- Oh, hi, Lindsey.

19:36.375 --> 19:41.290
Obstacle-avoidance is showin' a rise
out about 100m. What do you wanna do?

19:41.975 --> 19:45.163
I can't believe
you were dumb enough to come down here.

19:45.263 --> 19:47.480
Now you're stuck here for the storm.

19:47.580 --> 19:52.126
- That was dumb, hot rod. Real dumb.
- I didn't come down here to fight with you.

19:54.495 --> 19:56.480
Yeah, well...

19:56.580 --> 19:58.560
Then why did you come down?

19:58.660 --> 20:02.279
You need me. Nobody knows
the systems on this rig better than I do.

20:02.379 --> 20:06.601
Once you're disconnected, you guys are on
your own for however long this storm lasts.

20:06.701 --> 20:10.319
What if something was to happen
after the surface support clears off?

20:10.419 --> 20:14.561
Wow, you're right. Us poor dumb old boys
might've had to think for ourselves.

20:14.661 --> 20:16.646
It could've been a disaster.

20:18.015 --> 20:21.921
- You wanna know what I think?
- Jesus! Look where this thing is set.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.964
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

20:25.064 --> 20:28.360
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.483
No, seriously. I think you were.
Come on. It's OK.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.560
It's OK. You can admit it.

20:33.660 --> 20:35.683
I was worried... about the rig.

20:35.783 --> 20:38.484
I've got over four years
invested in this project.

20:38.584 --> 20:41.408
Yeah. You only had three years
invested in me.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.125
Well, you have to have priorities.

20:58.655 --> 21:03.519
It's kinda messy, but I guarantee you
it's the only bunk that won't be occupied.

21:03.619 --> 21:06.723
You can get a couple of hours' rest
before we get there.

21:06.823 --> 21:09.045
What are you still wearing that for?

21:10.535 --> 21:12.526
I don't know.

21:13.295 --> 21:15.286
Divorce ain't final.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.686
Forgot to take it off.

21:20.455 --> 21:22.520
I haven't worn mine in months.

21:22.620 --> 21:23.620
Yeah.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.687
Well, whatshisname wouldn't like it.
The suit.

21:30.095 --> 21:32.240
Do you always have to call him that?

21:32.340 --> 21:34.922
The suit. Makes you sound like such a hick.

21:35.022 --> 21:37.000
His name is Michael.

21:37.100 --> 21:40.240
How is Michael, then? Mr Brooks Brothers.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.740
Mr BMW.

21:42.303 --> 21:44.280
You still seeing him?

21:44.380 --> 21:45.380
No.

21:47.655 --> 21:51.359
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

21:51.459 --> 21:54.253
Terribly sorry. What happened?

21:56.255 --> 21:58.964
Why are you doing this?
This is none of your business!

21:59.064 --> 22:01.285
It's not a part of your life any more.

22:02.815 --> 22:04.960
I'll tell you what happened.

22:05.060 --> 22:08.083
You woke up one morning
in those satin sheets,

22:08.183 --> 22:11.443
rolled over,
and there was this good-looking guy.

22:11.543 --> 22:13.643
Well-groomed, expensive watch on.

22:13.743 --> 22:16.763
And you realised
"This guy never makes me laugh."

22:16.863 --> 22:20.442
That's it, Bud. That's it!
Aren't you clever? Jesus! You're clever!

22:20.542 --> 22:23.361
You should start your own talk show!
Ask Dr Bud.

22:23.461 --> 22:26.324
Advice to the lovelorn from 300 fathoms.

22:26.424 --> 22:27.973
Thank you. Thank you.

23:01.253 --> 23:03.053
Oh, shit!

23:05.773 --> 23:09.041
- Cuttin' you loose, Bud.
- OK, One Night. Stay clear.

23:09.141 --> 23:11.124
We're setting her down.

23:16.533 --> 23:17.533
Touchdown!

23:18.731 --> 23:22.600
This is us, sitting right on the edge
of the Cayman Trough.

23:22.700 --> 23:27.359
This is the Montana.
300m away, 70m below us.

23:27.459 --> 23:31.729
We think she slid down the wall
and now sits here on this outcropping.

23:32.731 --> 23:35.999
So we're gonna have to drop
straight down... here and...

23:36.099 --> 23:38.997
This tell us how much radiation we're gettin'?

23:39.097 --> 23:42.119
Whoa! I'm not going near
no radiation! No way!

23:42.219 --> 23:44.840
- Hippy, you pussy.
- What good is the money,

23:44.940 --> 23:47.278
six months later your dick drops off?

23:47.378 --> 23:50.357
We'll take readings as we go.
If the reactor's breached,

23:50.457 --> 23:54.517
the warheads have released
any radioactive debris, we'll just back off.

23:54.617 --> 23:56.596
- It's that simple.
- OK.

23:56.696 --> 24:00.278
OK. Hippy's not going,
so, McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.

24:00.378 --> 24:03.958
Goddamn it! You know
McWhirter can't run an ROV worth shit!

24:04.058 --> 24:05.999
Then you'd better go.

24:06.099 --> 24:07.699
I'll go.

24:08.176 --> 24:10.997
What is your problem? On this dive

24:11.097 --> 24:14.476
you'll do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me.

24:14.576 --> 24:18.769
And you'll follow those orders
without discussion. Is that clear?

24:20.411 --> 24:23.084
I want everyone
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

24:25.331 --> 24:28.838
- Gimme a hand loading Little Geek.
- Let's get suited up.

24:28.938 --> 24:31.001
Hey, guys! Hold it a second.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.571
Hold it!

24:33.817 --> 24:34.817
Whoa!

24:38.531 --> 24:39.931
Look...

24:40.616 --> 24:44.959
...it's 3am. These guys are running on
bad coffee and about four hours of sleep.

24:45.059 --> 24:47.276
Maybe you could cut them some slack.

24:47.376 --> 24:51.480
- I can't afford slack.
- You come on my rig, you don't talk to me,

24:51.580 --> 24:54.919
and you start ordering my people around.
It's not gonna work.

24:55.019 --> 24:59.359
You gotta know how to handle these people.
We got a certain way of doing things here.

24:59.459 --> 25:04.366
I'm not interested in your way of doing
things. Just get your team ready to dive.

25:09.731 --> 25:12.120
These guys have got no sense of humour.

25:16.211 --> 25:18.276
Bud, do you know your hand is blue?

25:18.376 --> 25:21.090
Finler, why don't you just shut up
and put your gear on?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.688
Keep it coming.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.717
Hippy, throw me
one of them cyalumes, please.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.680
- Good.
- Excuse me.

25:30.780 --> 25:34.880
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid breathing system. We just got them.

25:34.980 --> 25:38.239
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

25:38.339 --> 25:40.322
- Deep.
- How deep?

25:40.968 --> 25:42.448
It's classified.

25:42.806 --> 25:44.621
You breathe liquid
so you can't get compressed.

25:44.731 --> 25:48.360
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

25:48.919 --> 25:52.522
- Oxygenated, fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit!

25:54.458 --> 25:55.723
Check this out.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.544
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin'?

26:00.117 --> 26:03.651
- What do you doin'? You gonna kill her.
- It's okay. I've done this myself.

26:03.751 --> 26:05.943
Oh, man. look what you doin'!
You just drowning her!

26:06.086 --> 26:07.495
It's gonna be fine.

26:07.996 --> 26:10.121
I've breathed this myself.
He's gonna be fine.

26:10.241 --> 26:12.697
No, man! She... she's gonna drown.
Look, look! She's freakin' out.

26:12.797 --> 26:14.082
Just going through a
normal adjustment period.

26:14.182 --> 26:17.069
Normal? Is this look normal to you?
She's gonna drown!

26:17.169 --> 26:19.409
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

26:20.555 --> 26:22.824
He's taking the fluid into his lungs.

26:25.307 --> 26:26.740
Here he goes.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.127
There is a bit of anxiety here.

26:29.724 --> 26:31.109
Now he's starting to relax.

26:31.252 --> 26:33.473
He's breathing fine.
See, he's just moving.

26:33.783 --> 26:35.096
Getting plenty of oxygen.

26:35.359 --> 26:37.489
Damn rat's breathing that shit.

26:38.201 --> 26:42.570
That is, no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamned thing I ever saw.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.767
See the fluid is harder
to push in and out than air.

26:44.910 --> 26:46.629
It's a little more work to breath.

26:47.011 --> 26:49.852
He's doing fine.
He's diggin' it.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.980
She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.
All right, let her out! Now!

26:53.147 --> 26:54.890
- Now!
- Okay. All right.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.553
OK. Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs.

27:00.024 --> 27:01.862
All right. Give her here. Give her here.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.629
Here's your rat.

27:04.608 --> 27:06.855
- See? He's fine!
- It's a she.

27:08.839 --> 27:10.707
Going over the wall.

27:10.807 --> 27:12.790
Coming to bearing 065.

27:14.219 --> 27:16.204
Flatbed, you on line?

27:16.304 --> 27:19.894
Ten-four, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

27:20.579 --> 27:23.245
Starting our descent. Divers, how you doin'?

27:23.345 --> 27:25.287
Everybody's OK so far.

27:25.387 --> 27:28.684
Hang on, boys. It's all downhill from here.

27:28.784 --> 27:33.367
- Hey, how deep's the drop-off here?
- This here's the bottomless pit, baby.

27:33.467 --> 27:36.496
Two and a half miles straight down.

27:40.019 --> 27:42.004
Cab 3, it's Bud. You on line?

27:42.104 --> 27:44.047
Cab 3 check.

27:44.147 --> 27:46.130
I'm right behind you.

27:50.099 --> 27:51.887
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

27:51.987 --> 27:55.726
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

27:55.826 --> 27:57.969
Hang on. I'm gonna test my strobes.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.890
Cab 1, do you have a visual?

28:08.939 --> 28:11.526
- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Yeah.

28:11.626 --> 28:13.610
Roger that. Found it.

28:27.939 --> 28:30.323
Cab 1, radiation readings?

28:30.423 --> 28:32.926
Neutron counter's not showing much.

28:33.026 --> 28:36.643
All right.
Just continue forward along the hull.

28:36.743 --> 28:40.928
Copy that. Continuing forward.
You want me to get shots of everything, yes?

28:41.028 --> 28:43.366
Roger that. Document as much as you can.

28:43.466 --> 28:47.163
But, please, keep moving.
Remember, we're on a tight time line.

28:47.263 --> 28:49.250
Copy that.

28:52.019 --> 28:55.643
Coming up to the midships hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?

28:55.743 --> 28:57.172
Yeah, roger. I got it.

29:01.619 --> 29:04.248
- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it.

29:04.348 --> 29:07.367
- Roger. Holding.
- OK. It's all yours, Lieutenant.

29:07.467 --> 29:10.576
- All right, A Team.
- Let's do it.

29:23.899 --> 29:26.246
OK. Perry, Hippy.

29:26.346 --> 29:29.644
- Let's get that ROV launched.
- OK. We're on it, boss.

29:29.744 --> 29:30.744
Go!

29:35.579 --> 29:37.729
Little Geek is on the case.

29:47.816 --> 29:51.365
Monk here, sir.
We got the midships outer hatch open.

29:53.056 --> 29:55.047
Entering escape trunk.

29:57.776 --> 29:59.767
Inner hatch looks intact.

30:05.216 --> 30:08.128
It's flooded. All right. I'm gonna open her up.

30:17.376 --> 30:19.332
OK. Get in there.

30:20.816 --> 30:24.685
- Roger. Somebody get on that tether.
- Got it.

30:24.785 --> 30:29.486
Sorry about this, little buddy, but better
you than me. You know what I mean?

30:37.216 --> 30:40.404
Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right?

30:40.504 --> 30:44.120
That's right. It looks like
a couple of the hatches have sprung.

30:44.220 --> 30:47.324
Radiation's nominal.
Warheads must still be intact.

30:47.424 --> 30:49.401
How many are there?

30:49.501 --> 30:52.169
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.

30:53.216 --> 30:55.207
That's 192 warheads, Coffey.

30:56.256 --> 30:58.241
How powerful are they?

30:58.341 --> 31:02.402
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke.
50 kilotons nominal yield.

31:02.502 --> 31:04.532
Say... five times Hiroshima.

31:07.096 --> 31:09.087
Jesus Christ!

31:09.936 --> 31:11.921
It's World War III in a can.

31:12.021 --> 31:14.371
Let's knock off the chatter.

31:15.576 --> 31:18.482
OK. I'm headin' into the reactor compartment.

31:18.582 --> 31:20.960
- Getting a reading?
- It's twitching.

31:21.060 --> 31:23.570
But it's below the line you said was safe.

31:24.776 --> 31:27.085
All right. Let's get in there.

31:34.936 --> 31:39.002
Flatbed, drop down starboard
of the sail and stay along the cliff edge.

31:39.102 --> 31:41.087
OK. Copy that.

31:47.096 --> 31:49.326
Keep heading for the bow.

31:57.696 --> 31:59.687
OK, Flatbed. This looks good.

32:00.416 --> 32:02.054
Just set it down here.

32:06.376 --> 32:09.288
- We're solid.
- Let's go.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.730
All right. Let's go.

32:20.816 --> 32:23.933
OK. Let's just take it slow and easy goin' in.

32:24.936 --> 32:26.927
Don't take any chances.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.121
Where are we, Coffey?

32:54.221 --> 32:57.492
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.

33:12.736 --> 33:16.882
- You guys OK? Cat? Jammer?
- Right behind you, Bud.

33:16.982 --> 33:18.967
Check your gauges.

33:20.136 --> 33:22.121
How's your O2?

33:22.221 --> 33:25.484
- I'm OK.
- Yeah, gauges are good.

33:25.584 --> 33:26.584
OK.

33:27.225 --> 33:29.207
16 minutes to go.

33:38.296 --> 33:40.287
Jammer here. CO2 is up.

33:41.176 --> 33:43.167
- Breathe slower, buddy.
- OK.

33:49.936 --> 33:51.927
Come on. Let's keep up.

33:54.256 --> 33:57.009
All right. Up this way to the control centre.

34:22.536 --> 34:24.521
It's jammed! Gimme a hand!

34:24.621 --> 34:26.766
Get up here with that pry bar.

34:28.696 --> 34:30.766
It's moving. Pull!

34:39.456 --> 34:40.600
Jesus!

34:40.699 --> 34:43.246
All right! We knew we were gonna see this.

34:43.346 --> 34:45.327
Just move on.

34:48.456 --> 34:51.050
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer. Let's go.

35:24.816 --> 35:27.163
OK. Let's stay cool.

35:27.263 --> 35:29.372
Everybody stay cool.

35:31.016 --> 35:34.975
We can't help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

35:40.576 --> 35:42.168
Stay here.

35:57.696 --> 36:00.921
Hey, Jammer. You OK?

36:01.021 --> 36:03.805
- How you guys doin'?
- I'm dealin'.

36:03.905 --> 36:07.084
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.

36:07.184 --> 36:09.087
We're here. Let's get it done, OK?

36:09.856 --> 36:13.001
Brigman, take your men and continue aft.

36:13.101 --> 36:15.922
Split up into two teams.

36:16.022 --> 36:19.002
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

36:19.102 --> 36:20.495
Let's go.

36:28.376 --> 36:30.361
You OK, Jammer?

36:30.461 --> 36:32.447
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:37.256 --> 36:41.040
- What's this?
- Should be the missile launch control centre.

36:41.140 --> 36:43.600
- Don't touch anything.
- No.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.500
This way.

36:46.143 --> 36:48.286
I'm right behind you.

37:08.256 --> 37:10.640
- Still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

37:10.740 --> 37:14.206
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.456
Shit!

37:26.096 --> 37:28.087
Hey, Jammer.

37:29.256 --> 37:30.251
Hey!

37:30.351 --> 37:32.683
Hey! You OK?

37:32.783 --> 37:34.761
Deep and slow, big guy.

37:34.861 --> 37:38.363
- Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.
- Everybody's dead!

37:38.463 --> 37:42.123
- They're all dead!
- OK. I'm taking you back out. Let's go.

37:42.223 --> 37:43.623
I'm OK.

37:47.616 --> 37:49.601
I just can't go any further in.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.565
OK, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

37:52.665 --> 37:55.562
I've gotta check out this compartment,
all right?

37:55.662 --> 37:59.685
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold onto the end of this rope here.

37:59.785 --> 38:02.762
You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.

38:02.862 --> 38:05.406
- I got it.
- Pull it hard. Five more minutes.

38:05.506 --> 38:07.641
Just relax, all right? You'll be OK.

38:07.741 --> 38:09.294
- It's OK.
- Be right back.

38:53.216 --> 38:55.207
You still readin' me OK, big guy?

38:56.016 --> 38:58.371
Read you fine, Bud.

39:03.096 --> 39:06.162
OK. Just a few more minutes.

39:06.262 --> 39:09.684
There's a couple of compartments up ahead
that might have air.

39:09.784 --> 39:12.964
- OK. No problem.
- We gotta be sure, right?

39:13.064 --> 39:15.490
Hang on, Jammer. Just hold onto that...

39:22.056 --> 39:23.056
Shit!

39:24.423 --> 39:26.407
Bud? Can you hear me?

39:27.296 --> 39:28.296
Bud?

39:32.536 --> 39:33.536
Goddamn it!

39:46.056 --> 39:47.330
Oh, Jesus!

40:16.176 --> 40:17.575
Bud, is that you?

40:39.976 --> 40:41.967
Hang on, Jammer.

40:44.336 --> 40:46.611
Lew! Cat! Hurry up, on the double!

40:47.776 --> 40:49.767
I'm on my way!

40:55.656 --> 40:57.056
Jammer!

41:00.456 --> 41:02.970
- What's the problem?
- He's convulsing!

41:04.296 --> 41:06.446
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!

41:07.656 --> 41:11.092
Gotta get the O2 cut down! Turn him over!

41:12.416 --> 41:14.805
Crank it down, man! You're losing him!

41:17.456 --> 41:21.565
All right. We've gotta get him outta here!
Let's go. Let's move it.

41:21.665 --> 41:23.641
Easy, big fella.

41:23.741 --> 41:24.805
That's it.

41:26.856 --> 41:28.921
One Night, do you see the divers?

41:29.021 --> 41:31.400
- Are they out yet?
- Negative, Lindsey.

41:31.500 --> 41:34.764
Haven't seen hide nor hair.
Let's give 'em two minutes more max

41:34.864 --> 41:36.972
and then I'll sound the diver recall...

41:56.616 --> 41:58.601
Lindsey, do you copy?

41:58.701 --> 42:01.602
Meet me at Flatbed!
This is a diver emergency!

42:01.702 --> 42:05.132
- Lins, do you copy!
- Yeah, copy you, Bud. I'm on my way.

42:11.016 --> 42:13.007
Look, I'm just a medic.

42:13.776 --> 42:17.885
Which is mostly about patching holes.
This type of thing, it's...

42:17.985 --> 42:19.967
There's not much I can do.

42:20.736 --> 42:22.806
The coma could last hours or days.

42:29.816 --> 42:32.562
So you didn't get anything on the cameras?

42:32.662 --> 42:34.801
No, I didn't get a picture of it.

42:34.901 --> 42:37.163
- What about the video?
- No.

42:37.263 --> 42:39.241
We lost power right then.

42:39.341 --> 42:41.965
Look, I just don't wanna talk about this, OK?

42:42.065 --> 42:44.041
Fine. Be that way.

42:44.141 --> 42:46.440
Look, I don't know what I saw, Bud, OK?

42:46.540 --> 42:49.564
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible-fine.

42:49.664 --> 42:52.482
It's a Russian submersible. No problem.

42:52.582 --> 42:55.322
Yeah, but you think it was something else.

42:55.422 --> 42:56.422
What?

42:57.741 --> 42:59.727
One of ours?

43:02.136 --> 43:03.136
No.

43:03.822 --> 43:05.807
Well, whose then?

43:07.056 --> 43:09.047
Come on, Lindsey. Talk to me.

43:10.216 --> 43:12.483
Look, Jammer saw something down there.

43:12.583 --> 43:16.243
- Something that scared the hell out of him.
- His mixture got screwed up.

43:16.343 --> 43:20.083
Jammer panicked. He pranged his regulator
and his mixture got screwed up.

43:20.183 --> 43:22.531
But what did he see that made him panic?

43:24.376 --> 43:26.367
Well, what do you think he saw?

43:28.096 --> 43:30.400
I don't know.

43:30.500 --> 43:34.330
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

43:35.336 --> 43:37.720
Could have been a Russian bogey.

43:37.820 --> 43:39.886
CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.

43:40.696 --> 43:45.081
Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a
Victor, were tracked to within 50 miles of here.

43:45.181 --> 43:48.486
And now they don't know
where the hell they are. OK.

43:50.016 --> 43:53.843
I don't have any choice.
I'm confirming you to go to Phase Two.

43:53.943 --> 43:58.566
You'll recover one warhead, arm it,
and wait for further instructions.

43:59.576 --> 44:02.329
- Have we got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

44:04.295 --> 44:05.764
Come on!

44:05.864 --> 44:07.920
- What'd he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!

44:08.020 --> 44:13.444
...early reports that the Montana encountered
a Soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking

44:13.544 --> 44:16.484
and the Kremlin
continues to deny any involvement.

44:16.584 --> 44:18.560
That's us! That's us, man!

44:18.660 --> 44:22.359
Benthic Petroleum are participating
in the recovery operation,

44:22.459 --> 44:24.520
but we have little information.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.999
We want names!

44:27.099 --> 44:30.523
Hey, that's the Explorer! We're famous!

44:30.623 --> 44:33.202
There is a tremendous amount of activity.

44:33.302 --> 44:37.840
With Cuba only 80 miles away,
the massive build-up of American forces

44:37.940 --> 44:41.123
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

44:41.223 --> 44:45.563
Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels,

44:45.663 --> 44:47.800
have been circling the area

44:47.900 --> 44:50.489
- and Soviet aircraft have been warned away.
- This sucks!

44:51.615 --> 44:55.484
- Hippy, what's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me? Nothing!

44:55.584 --> 44:58.481
We're in the middle
of some international incident

44:58.581 --> 45:02.359
- like the Cuban Missile Crisis!
- Figured that out for yourself, Hip?

45:02.459 --> 45:04.563
We got Russian subs creeping around.

45:04.663 --> 45:08.279
Anything goes wrong,
they could say whatever they want happened.

45:08.379 --> 45:10.962
Relax, will you?
You're making the women nervous.

45:11.062 --> 45:13.280
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know,

45:13.380 --> 45:16.723
those SEALs ain't tellin' us diddly.
Something is goin' on!

45:16.823 --> 45:20.322
- Come on, come on.
- Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

45:20.422 --> 45:22.400
Everything is.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.560
Coffey's splitting with Flatbed!

45:24.660 --> 45:27.800
I showed him how to work the controls
and they're outta here!

45:27.900 --> 45:29.923
- Didn't you tell him we need it?
- Yeah!

45:30.023 --> 45:32.522
- Where the hell is he takin' it?
- I have no idea!

45:32.622 --> 45:33.622
Shit!

45:36.293 --> 45:37.922
Coffey! Come back! We need

45:38.022 --> 45:40.397
the big arm to unhook the umbilical.

45:40.497 --> 45:42.802
There's a goddamn hurricane coming!

45:43.573 --> 45:46.007
- He switched off.
- It's unbelievable.

45:47.613 --> 45:52.050
Go back down and tell those men
to get below and stay there!

46:02.373 --> 46:04.837
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now!

46:04.937 --> 46:07.961
- All right. Do it, then.
- No problem, except your boys

46:08.061 --> 46:12.598
went sightseeing with Flatbed. My people
need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end.

46:12.698 --> 46:14.721
- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?!

46:14.821 --> 46:17.407
We're gonna get the shit kicked out of us
by our pal Fred in two hours!

46:23.772 --> 46:26.721
OK. Set cold tab fitting to 200psi.

46:26.821 --> 46:29.239
- Set.
- There she goes.

46:29.339 --> 46:31.679
- She's breakin' loose.
- Bringin' her up.

46:31.779 --> 46:32.779
OK.

46:33.857 --> 46:35.598
All right.

46:35.698 --> 46:37.677
Clear the hatch.

46:37.777 --> 46:39.757
Go on with it.

46:39.857 --> 46:41.677
Go on. That's it. Up.

46:41.777 --> 46:44.279
Sir, the missile looks intact.

46:44.379 --> 46:47.517
Little is known about the events
leading up to the collision.

46:47.617 --> 46:49.996
The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton

46:50.096 --> 46:55.718
apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class
destroyer in low visibility conditions.

46:55.818 --> 46:59.559
In violent seas, little hope remains
for over 100 Russian crewmen,

46:59.659 --> 47:03.601
still missing after the sinking an hour ago.
Soviet military spokesmen

47:03.701 --> 47:07.316
have claimed that the collision
constituted an unprovoked attack.

47:07.416 --> 47:09.839
- This was denied by...
- Bud, this is big time.

47:09.939 --> 47:12.446
...who said that Captain Michael Sweeney...

47:13.612 --> 47:17.040
- OK. It's clear.
- It's all yours, sir.

47:17.140 --> 47:19.878
I'm gonna swing it away and drop it.

47:19.978 --> 47:21.978
Check. OK.

47:22.456 --> 47:26.641
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

47:26.741 --> 47:30.239
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

47:30.339 --> 47:33.078
Remove explosive bolts one through six

47:33.178 --> 47:37.051
- in counterclockwise sequence.
- Check. Removing bolt one.

47:45.492 --> 47:49.079
Negotiators have walked out
of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks

47:49.179 --> 47:51.961
in protest over the incident this morning.

47:52.061 --> 47:55.357
The deterioration of relations
with the United States...

47:55.457 --> 47:58.118
Soviet build-up of tanks
and aircraft has continued.

47:58.218 --> 48:02.438
...this morning, all US and NATO military
forces have been put on full alert.

48:02.538 --> 48:04.517
It's on every channel.

48:04.617 --> 48:06.597
Well, you just feel so helpless.

48:06.697 --> 48:09.199
You can see it coming, but what can you do?

48:09.299 --> 48:11.277
What can anyone do?

48:11.377 --> 48:13.681
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.

48:14.652 --> 48:16.637
So why are we doing this?

48:16.737 --> 48:18.919
If it happens, it happens.

48:19.019 --> 48:21.519
There's nothing I can do about it, right?

48:21.619 --> 48:23.603
I just don't think about it.

48:38.492 --> 48:39.492
All right! Let's get their gear off! Then
clear the sub! We gotta get it outta here!

48:41.892 --> 48:45.117
Come on, let's go! Let's move it!
One Night, you're up!

48:45.217 --> 48:47.000
Get ready to roll, baby!

48:47.100 --> 48:49.731
- Don't touch that! Just back away.
- Excusez-moi!

48:52.412 --> 48:55.006
Hey, Coffey. We're a little pressed for time.

48:59.292 --> 49:00.486
Prick.

49:00.612 --> 49:03.162
This ain't no drill, Slick. Make me proud.

49:03.262 --> 49:05.243
Piece of cake, baby.

49:38.410 --> 49:40.518
What's the problem, One Night?

49:40.618 --> 49:44.995
All hell must be breaking loose up there.
This cable's pissin' me off!

49:45.095 --> 49:49.208
- I can't get a grip on it.
- Well, keep tryin', baby. Just keep tryin'.

49:49.930 --> 49:51.921
Son of a bitch!

49:53.130 --> 49:55.434
Shit! We got a problem!

49:55.534 --> 49:58.718
- What's going on?
- We're losing number two thruster!

49:58.818 --> 50:00.562
Bearing's going!

50:01.530 --> 50:05.000
It's not holding!
We're swinging out of position here!

50:14.130 --> 50:15.330
Jesus!

50:22.770 --> 50:23.770
Shit!

50:34.330 --> 50:36.315
The rig is movin'!

50:36.415 --> 50:40.114
Yeah, I can see that. Topside!
Pay out some slack! We're gettin' dragged!

50:40.214 --> 50:43.202
Down on number one winch! Down on one!

50:48.610 --> 50:50.566
We're headed for the drop-off!

51:19.210 --> 51:23.203
What the hell...?
We just lost all the topside feeds!

51:25.610 --> 51:27.638
Shit! Get 'em on the UQC.

51:27.738 --> 51:30.324
- Any damage on the hull?
- Bud!

51:32.130 --> 51:34.115
- We lost the crane!
- Say again. What?

51:34.215 --> 51:36.760
The crane! We've lost the crane!

51:36.860 --> 51:38.841
It's on its way down to you!

51:39.930 --> 51:42.967
All right, everybody!
Everybody rig for impact!

51:43.530 --> 51:47.728
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let's move it! Let's go! Go!

51:49.890 --> 51:51.881
- Wait!
- Get in here!

51:54.650 --> 51:58.006
- What the hell is goin' on around here?!
- I don't know!

52:05.130 --> 52:07.439
You two help secure the rig! Let's go!

52:15.970 --> 52:19.724
One Night! Get the hell outta there!
The crane's comin' down!

52:28.450 --> 52:30.168
I'm OK. I'm clear, Bud.

52:41.010 --> 52:43.604
I've got it! It's headed straight for us!

53:45.969 --> 53:47.368
Oh, shit!

53:59.249 --> 54:00.887
- Oh, God...
- No!

54:02.609 --> 54:03.609
Bud?

54:03.736 --> 54:05.606
Grab onto something!

54:10.209 --> 54:11.409
Jesus!

54:20.049 --> 54:23.564
- Battery room's flooding! Let's go!
- Cat, put that out!

54:25.209 --> 54:28.838
- Bud! The drill room's floodin'!
- Get back down there!

54:31.649 --> 54:33.634
Go! I'll take the battery room!

54:33.734 --> 54:34.934
Jesus!

54:52.049 --> 54:53.049
Shit!

54:55.969 --> 54:58.715
- Get out of there!
- Close the door!

54:58.815 --> 55:00.800
Seal the room!

55:08.409 --> 55:11.003
Lindsey! Let's get outta here!

55:58.848 --> 56:01.043
- Hold this on me!
- OK!

56:06.008 --> 56:07.594
Lindsey!

56:07.694 --> 56:09.167
I got it!

56:29.808 --> 56:32.083
Let's get the hell outta here!

56:37.368 --> 56:39.168
Let's go!

56:39.453 --> 56:42.053
Hit the door!

56:45.088 --> 56:46.088
No!

56:48.648 --> 56:49.648
Bud!

56:59.168 --> 57:02.313
Finler, cut the hose! Cut the line to the motor!

57:02.413 --> 57:04.553
I can't open it from out here!

57:04.653 --> 57:07.685
Finler, cut the hose!

57:09.568 --> 57:10.968
Finler!

57:34.928 --> 57:35.928
Hey!

57:39.128 --> 57:40.128
Hey!

57:40.608 --> 57:41.608
Hey!

57:43.848 --> 57:47.276
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat! Cat, help me out, man!

57:47.376 --> 57:48.721
Hang on!

57:51.528 --> 57:55.237
The hose! Cut the hose!
The line to the motor! Hurry up, man!

57:59.368 --> 58:01.635
Come on, Cat!

58:01.735 --> 58:02.935
Hurry!

58:03.696 --> 58:06.407
Come on, Sonny!
Help me out! Come on! Push!

58:10.488 --> 58:14.075
- Come on, Sonny! Let's go!
- Come on! Let's go! We gotta go!

58:14.175 --> 58:16.595
Get outta here! Come on! Move it!

58:16.695 --> 58:17.695
Go!

58:18.928 --> 58:20.072
Get the hatch, Cat!

58:20.172 --> 58:22.079
Get the hatch!

58:35.728 --> 58:38.634
- You all right? Everybody OK?
- Yeah.

58:38.734 --> 58:40.713
Son of a bitch!

58:40.813 --> 58:41.813
Oh, man!

58:48.606 --> 58:51.996
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore Two. Do you read me?

58:55.685 --> 58:59.192
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore.

58:59.292 --> 59:01.270
Do you read me? Over.

59:01.370 --> 59:03.674
Forget it, Sonny. They're gone, man.

59:06.565 --> 59:08.556
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Hey.

59:09.725 --> 59:11.716
They're gone.

59:14.325 --> 59:15.325
OK?

59:17.805 --> 59:19.796
I just wanna get out of this.

59:23.085 --> 59:25.599
I'd just like to see my wife one more time.

59:26.245 --> 59:29.601
Well, all right, then.
You'd better keep trying, huh?

59:30.325 --> 59:33.237
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Deepcore Two.

59:35.165 --> 59:40.152
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
Do you read me? This is Deepcore Two. Over.

59:40.252 --> 59:42.236
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:11.996
Hey, Jammer.

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:19.153
- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.

01:00:19.253 --> 01:00:23.523
I'll deal with it, all right?
I'll deal with me. You deal with yourself.

01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:26.436
Find your buddy?

01:00:27.205 --> 01:00:29.196
- No.
- Tighter.

01:00:29.805 --> 01:00:31.796
- Brigman.
- What?

01:00:33.685 --> 01:00:35.670
I was under orders.

01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:37.756
I had no choice.

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:54.116
How's it going, Cat?

01:01:04.405 --> 01:01:07.071
- What's the scoop, ace?
- Well,

01:01:07.171 --> 01:01:11.194
I can get power to this module
and sub-bay if I reroute these buses.

01:01:11.294 --> 01:01:14.880
But I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

01:01:16.485 --> 01:01:19.231
But there won't be enough to run the heaters.

01:01:19.331 --> 01:01:22.283
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

01:01:24.283 --> 01:01:25.672
- What about O2?
- Yeah, well, brace yourself.

01:01:25.772 --> 01:01:30.757
If we close off the sections we're not using,
we have about maybe 12 hours' worth.

01:01:32.963 --> 01:01:35.991
The storm's gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

01:01:36.091 --> 01:01:38.068
Yeah, well...

01:01:38.168 --> 01:01:40.148
I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

01:01:40.248 --> 01:01:44.352
There are some storage tanks outboard
next to the wrecked module.

01:01:44.452 --> 01:01:47.276
I'll have to go outside, though,
and tie onto them.

01:01:50.883 --> 01:01:52.883
Hey, Lins.

01:01:53.011 --> 01:01:54.988
- Lins.
- Yeah?

01:01:55.088 --> 01:01:56.357
I'm glad you're here.

01:01:57.683 --> 01:01:58.683
Yeah?

01:02:00.763 --> 01:02:01.957
I'm not.

01:02:28.402 --> 01:02:32.069
Hey. Found Cab 3.
Deader than dogshit, boss.

01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:35.111
That girder went right through the brainpan.

01:02:35.211 --> 01:02:37.193
Yeah, I see that.

01:02:39.882 --> 01:02:42.715
- Where are you?
- Living quarters. Level two.

01:02:49.962 --> 01:02:50.962
Jeez!

01:02:53.882 --> 01:02:55.873
That's Perry.

01:02:59.722 --> 01:03:03.078
That's it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.

01:03:04.042 --> 01:03:05.242
Jesus.

01:03:08.042 --> 01:03:10.027
We just leave 'em there?

01:03:10.127 --> 01:03:14.400
Yeah, for now. We got no choice. Our first
priority is to get somethin' to breathe.

01:03:25.082 --> 01:03:27.711
Where are you now, Lins?

01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:30.111
I'm under the starboard tri-module.

01:03:32.882 --> 01:03:35.715
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.

01:03:45.762 --> 01:03:49.269
- How's it look?
- Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.

01:03:49.369 --> 01:03:53.146
- There's a lot of wreckage out here.
- Well, don't get fouled.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.387
- Hit me with that nine sixteenths, OK?
- Yeah.

01:03:56.487 --> 01:03:58.473
Thank you. So...

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.991
- There you were.
- Yeah, there we were.

01:04:03.402 --> 01:04:06.075
Side by side on the same ship
for two months.

01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:11.471
I'm a tool pusher and we're testing
this automated derrick of hers.

01:04:11.571 --> 01:04:14.271
We get back on the beach
and we're livin' together.

01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:16.427
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

01:04:16.527 --> 01:04:19.907
Well, we were due to go back out
on the same ship. Six months of tests.

01:04:20.007 --> 01:04:23.307
If you were married, you got a stateroom.
Otherwise it was bunks.

01:04:23.407 --> 01:04:28.027
OK. Good reason. Will you come over here
and tighten this for me? Then what?

01:04:28.127 --> 01:04:31.108
Then it was all right
there for a while, you know.

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:34.667
Then she got promoted
to chief engineer on this thing.

01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:39.153
- She went front office on you, man.
- Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.

01:04:40.082 --> 01:04:42.110
She's just too damn aggressive.

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.999
Son of a bitch!

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:47.788
She didn't leave me. She just left me behind.

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.918
Bud, let me tell you somethin'.

01:04:51.682 --> 01:04:54.355
She ain't half as smart as she thinks she is.

01:04:57.362 --> 01:04:58.715
Get outta here.

01:05:32.642 --> 01:05:35.236
Come on. Let's see those muscles.

01:05:36.322 --> 01:05:38.626
Bingo! That's one.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:40.707
Two for two.

01:05:40.807 --> 01:05:42.607
Hey, hey.

01:05:43.602 --> 01:05:45.672
Lindsey, do you read me? Over.

01:05:46.922 --> 01:05:49.311
Copy you, Hippy. What's the matter?

01:05:50.642 --> 01:05:53.830
Oh, shit.
The power's jackin' around with us again.

01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:55.710
Lindsey, come back.

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:58.191
I just lost video. Lins, are you there...?

01:05:59.962 --> 01:06:01.953
Hippy, do you copy?

01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:06.760
Lins, you copy?

01:06:07.522 --> 01:06:09.322
Oh, shit!

01:06:09.607 --> 01:06:12.833
Oh, what the hell! Hippy, do you copy?

01:06:13.922 --> 01:06:15.428
Damn it!

01:06:15.528 --> 01:06:17.160
Bud, do you copy? Over.

01:06:20.202 --> 01:06:22.511
I seem to be having a problem here.

01:08:35.442 --> 01:08:36.442
Shit!

01:08:49.562 --> 01:08:51.162
Damn it!

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.029
- That's a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive light?

01:09:25.129 --> 01:09:29.426
Come on, you guys. That's the smaller one.
That's the smaller one here.

01:09:29.526 --> 01:09:32.389
- You can see how it's zigging around.
- Whatever it is.

01:09:32.488 --> 01:09:35.386
I'm telling you what it is.
You're just not hearing me.

01:09:35.486 --> 01:09:38.305
- Now, Lindsey...
- There is something down there.

01:09:38.406 --> 01:09:42.386
- Something not us.
- You could be more... specific.

01:09:42.486 --> 01:09:44.470
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:47.305
Not human.

01:09:47.404 --> 01:09:50.551
Get it? Something non-human but intelligent.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.677
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.585
A non-terrestrial intelligence.

01:10:02.685 --> 01:10:07.310
NTIs. Oh, man, that's better than UFOs.
But that works too.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.237
Underwater Flying Objects.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.065
- Are we talking little space friends here?
- Hell, yeah!

01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:19.225
Hot rods of the gods! Right, Lins?

01:10:19.325 --> 01:10:21.305
No, no, really. It could be NTIs.

01:10:21.405 --> 01:10:24.066
- The CIA has known about 'em for ever.
- Step outside.

01:10:24.166 --> 01:10:27.864
- They abduct people all the time, man.
- Hippy, would you do me a favour?

01:10:27.964 --> 01:10:29.945
Stay off my side.

01:10:30.045 --> 01:10:33.237
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.111
I... Come here.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.026
- Jesus, Lins!
- Something really important's happening.

01:10:41.126 --> 01:10:45.505
I'm trying to keep the situation under control.
I can't allow this kind of hysteria.

01:10:45.605 --> 01:10:48.637
Who's hysterical?! Nobody's hysterical!

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.785
When you're hanging on by your fingernails,
you don't go waving your arms around.

01:10:53.885 --> 01:10:58.585
I saw something. I'm not gonna go in there
and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.

01:10:58.685 --> 01:11:01.506
- Please.
- You are the most stubborn woman I know.

01:11:01.606 --> 01:11:03.585
Yes, I am!

01:11:03.685 --> 01:11:05.984
But I need you to believe me right now.

01:11:06.084 --> 01:11:09.108
Now, come on. Look at me. Come on.
Am I stressed out?

01:11:09.208 --> 01:11:13.708
Do I have any symptoms of pressure -
sickness, tremors, slurred speech?

01:11:13.808 --> 01:11:15.791
- No.
- No.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.835
Bud, this is me - Lindsey. OK?

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.713
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.665
Now watch my lips.

01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:27.955
I saw these things.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.348
I touched one of them.
And... it wasn't some clunky steel can...

01:11:33.448 --> 01:11:35.829
...like we would build.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.665
It glided.

01:11:38.765 --> 01:11:41.672
It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.185
Oh, God, I wish you'd been there.

01:11:45.285 --> 01:11:47.265
It was a machine.

01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:51.797
It was a machine, but it was alive.
It was like a... like a dance of light.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.065
Please. You have to trust me.

01:11:56.165 --> 01:12:00.349
Now, I don't think they mean us any harm.
I don't know how I know that.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.635
It's just... a feeling.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.509
Jesus! I'm supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?

01:12:07.609 --> 01:12:12.385
- You think Coffey's gonna go on a feeling?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.

01:12:12.485 --> 01:12:15.030
Coffey looks and he sees Russians.

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.111
He sees hate and fear.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.753
You have to look with better eyes than that.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.279
Please.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.597
I can't, Lins.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.231
I'm sorry.

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:37.586
All I want is 24-hour surveillance
on exterior cameras.

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:41.026
- You've got six people. I've got...
- Comin' through!

01:12:41.126 --> 01:12:43.109
Everybody just stop!

01:12:49.278 --> 01:12:54.787
All right. I want around-the-clock manning
of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.

01:12:54.887 --> 01:12:57.023
That Russian bogey comes back,

01:12:57.123 --> 01:13:00.423
- I don't think we should be taking a nap.
- Give me a break, Coffey.

01:13:00.523 --> 01:13:03.866
Those things live three and a half miles down
in an abyssal trench.

01:13:03.966 --> 01:13:06.472
Trust me, they're not speaking Russian.

01:13:09.478 --> 01:13:11.543
Have you finished the repairs

01:13:11.643 --> 01:13:13.993
- on the acoustical transmitter yet?
- Nope.

01:13:15.318 --> 01:13:18.746
- Why not?
- I was having my nails done.

01:13:18.846 --> 01:13:20.823
Well, get it done.

01:13:20.923 --> 01:13:23.068
Kiss my ass.

01:13:34.438 --> 01:13:36.423
All right.

01:13:36.523 --> 01:13:38.822
Get something straight.

01:13:38.922 --> 01:13:41.063
You people are under my authority.

01:13:41.163 --> 01:13:43.462
Look, pardner...

01:13:43.562 --> 01:13:45.666
we don't work for you.

01:13:45.766 --> 01:13:47.749
We don't take orders from you.

01:13:48.398 --> 01:13:50.514
And we don't much like you.

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.438
Hey, Cat!

01:13:57.318 --> 01:13:58.313
Yeah.

01:13:58.413 --> 01:14:01.834
Why don't you take
the first watch on sonar? OK?

01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:04.758
Right on.

01:14:06.118 --> 01:14:09.987
Sonny, you get a couple of hours' sleep.
Then you spell Cat, all right?

01:14:10.087 --> 01:14:12.751
Hippy, you handle exterior surveillance.

01:14:14.318 --> 01:14:19.312
One Night... Will you do me a favour
and see if you can get that transmitter fixed?

01:14:20.478 --> 01:14:22.867
- All right?
- Give me a couple of hours.

01:14:32.198 --> 01:14:33.598
Got it.

01:14:55.318 --> 01:14:57.303
All right.

01:14:57.403 --> 01:15:01.277
Come on, AJ Squared Away.
A little to the left.

01:15:02.478 --> 01:15:04.469
What is...?

01:15:11.958 --> 01:15:14.472
Oh, this is not happening.

01:15:21.838 --> 01:15:25.387
I'm shaking, man. All right. Wait. And now...

01:15:26.518 --> 01:15:28.918
Here's MIRV!

01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:36.422
- Oh, come on, man! What else could it be?
- Why bring it here?

01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:41.143
It's gotta be some kind of emergency plan
to keep it away from the Russians, right?

01:15:41.243 --> 01:15:43.542
Look, they hot-wire one of the nukes.

01:15:43.642 --> 01:15:46.746
They use some kind of detonator
that they brought.

01:15:46.846 --> 01:15:50.622
Then they stick it back in the sub.
Fry the whole thing up. Bam!

01:15:50.722 --> 01:15:52.709
Slicker than snot.

01:15:54.558 --> 01:15:57.391
I'm tellin' you. And I'm not being paranoi...

01:15:58.278 --> 01:16:00.078
Hi, Lins.

01:16:07.875 --> 01:16:12.702
- Lins, will you just wait a second?
- If you don't do something about it, I will!

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:16.382
- Lindsey, we'll do something about it!
- Fellas?! Hello!

01:16:16.482 --> 01:16:19.865
- Lins! Stop and think about this for a second.
- What?

01:16:39.955 --> 01:16:43.984
You know, you've got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.

01:16:44.084 --> 01:16:48.024
With all that's goin' on up in the world,
you bring a nuclear weapon

01:16:48.124 --> 01:16:49.903
- in here!
- Mrs Brigman...

01:16:50.003 --> 01:16:53.699
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

01:16:53.799 --> 01:16:57.223
Mrs Brigman, you don't need to know
the details of our operation.

01:16:57.323 --> 01:17:00.620
- It's better if you don't.
- You're right! I don't need to know!

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:05.505
What I need to know is that thing is
off this rig! Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?!

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:09.903
You're becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

01:17:10.003 --> 01:17:14.503
Now, you either do an about-face and walk
out of here, or I'll have you escorted out.

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:17.581
I will not do an about-face and get outta here!

01:17:17.681 --> 01:17:22.785
- Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
- Emergency! Maintenance Room B! Move it!

01:17:22.885 --> 01:17:24.424
On the double!

01:17:24.524 --> 01:17:25.524
Now!

01:17:26.164 --> 01:17:30.387
- In here! Come on! We got trouble! Come on!
- What's goin' on?

01:17:30.515 --> 01:17:32.515
All right!

01:17:33.564 --> 01:17:37.142
- What's up? What's happening?
- You let her go, man. Do it.

01:17:37.242 --> 01:17:38.944
Do it now!

01:17:39.044 --> 01:17:40.593
Let her go.

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:45.066
The smartest thing you ever did.

01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:51.024
- Coffey, you son of a bitch!
- Lindsey! Cool it.

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:55.631
- What's the problem?
- Nothing. We were just leaving. Weren't we?

01:18:15.475 --> 01:18:17.466
We don't need them.

01:18:18.555 --> 01:18:20.546
We can't trust them.

01:18:23.555 --> 01:18:25.546
We may have to take steps.

01:18:29.075 --> 01:18:31.066
We're gonna have to take steps.

01:18:35.515 --> 01:18:39.102
Lins, I want you
to stay away from that guy. I mean it.

01:18:39.202 --> 01:18:41.702
The guy is gone. Did you see his hands?

01:18:41.802 --> 01:18:43.940
What? He's got the shakes?

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.341
Look, he's operating on his own.
He's cut off from his chain of command.

01:18:48.441 --> 01:18:51.623
He's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis.

01:18:51.723 --> 01:18:53.700
And he's got a nuclear weapon.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.702
So, as a personal favour to me, will you try
to put your tongue in neutral for a while?

01:18:58.802 --> 01:19:02.265
I gotta tell you. I give this whole thing
a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

01:19:40.336 --> 01:19:44.205
You can just punch into his primary
guidance chip where you want him to go

01:19:44.305 --> 01:19:47.441
- and he'll go there, right?
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey.

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:48.723
Why, Hip? Come on.

01:19:48.823 --> 01:19:53.723
Because even if it could take the pressure
at that depth, which I don't think it can,

01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:58.840
without the tether, you know what would
happen? It would just sit like a dumb shit.

01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:02.922
Something would have to pass
in front of the camera for you to see anything.

01:20:03.022 --> 01:20:05.682
But we could get lucky.
So we should go for it.

01:20:05.782 --> 01:20:08.203
I really ought to talk to Bud about this.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:12.761
No. This is between you and me. We get
proof and then we tell the others. Hippy, look.

01:20:12.861 --> 01:20:17.045
If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren't Russians down there,

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:20.042
maybe he'll ease off the button a little bit.

01:20:20.142 --> 01:20:25.043
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me more
than anything we're gonna find down there.

01:20:25.143 --> 01:20:29.334
He's a goddamn
AJ Squared Away jarhead robot!

01:20:32.376 --> 01:20:34.963
Give me a couple of hours.
I'll see what I can do.

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:36.614
Great. Thanks.

01:20:44.856 --> 01:20:46.847
How's that?

01:20:50.176 --> 01:20:51.576
Thanks.

01:21:13.376 --> 01:21:15.367
Virgil, turn on your side.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.482
All right. You're all set, big guy.

01:21:46.582 --> 01:21:49.409
Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face.

01:21:58.256 --> 01:22:00.247
Good night, little buddy.

01:23:44.376 --> 01:23:45.376
Bud!

01:23:46.701 --> 01:23:48.101
Get up!

01:24:01.696 --> 01:24:02.696
Cat?

01:24:04.736 --> 01:24:05.736
Cat!

01:24:06.023 --> 01:24:08.769
Hey! Goddamn... Leave me alone.

01:24:16.896 --> 01:24:17.896
Bud!

01:24:21.376 --> 01:24:23.521
No, wait. It's OK.

01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:25.761
Sweet Christ almighty!

01:24:25.861 --> 01:24:28.245
I think it likes you.

01:24:45.896 --> 01:24:48.126
It's trying to communicate.

01:24:49.816 --> 01:24:51.616
It's Bud.

01:24:55.136 --> 01:24:57.730
- It's wonderful!
- It's me!

01:25:00.576 --> 01:25:02.806
- No. Don't...
- It's OK.

01:25:07.616 --> 01:25:09.607
Is it alive?

01:25:12.576 --> 01:25:14.567
Lindsey, no...

01:25:16.016 --> 01:25:17.816
Seawater.

01:25:18.064 --> 01:25:19.664
Oh, man.

01:25:32.296 --> 01:25:33.896
Come on!

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:38.645
- Hurry!
- Where the hell's it going?

01:25:48.856 --> 01:25:51.320
Hurry! I think it's headed for B module!

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.407
Lins, you see it?

01:26:51.015 --> 01:26:55.640
So, raise your hand if you think
it was a Russian water tentacle.

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:57.364
Lieutenant?

01:26:57.464 --> 01:26:59.446
No? Well...

01:27:00.415 --> 01:27:02.400
A breakthrough.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.682
Hey, ace,

01:27:03.782 --> 01:27:08.400
- you done impressing yourself?
- No way that thing could just be seawater.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:13.200
They must have learned to control water.
I mean, at a molecular level.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:17.201
They can plasticise it, pulverise it,
do whatever they wanna do with it.

01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:22.202
- They can put it under intelligent control.
- Maybe... their whole technology

01:27:22.302 --> 01:27:25.128
is based on that-controlling water.

01:27:26.255 --> 01:27:29.363
Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?

01:27:29.463 --> 01:27:30.463
No.

01:27:30.742 --> 01:27:34.322
You know, I don't think that
that thing you saw was one of them.

01:27:34.422 --> 01:27:37.880
- What are you talkin' about?
- I mean, I don't think it was an NTI.

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:41.323
I think it was like their version of an ROV.
Like Big Geek.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:44.560
Hippy, you mean
they was just checkin' us out?

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.640
- Yeah.
- How come?

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:48.720
Curious, I suppose.

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:52.012
We're probably the first people
they've ever seen.

01:28:07.975 --> 01:28:11.604
It went straight for the warhead.
And they think it's cute!

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:32.046
You need to get some sleep.

01:28:41.295 --> 01:28:42.694
We have no...

01:28:43.495 --> 01:28:46.134
...way of warning the surface.

01:28:47.335 --> 01:28:49.326
And you know what that means?

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:53.526
It means whatever happens...

01:28:54.575 --> 01:28:56.566
...is up to us.

01:28:57.735 --> 01:28:58.735
Us.

01:30:04.413 --> 01:30:08.878
So you think they're from down there
originally? Or from...

01:30:08.978 --> 01:30:10.958
...you know.

01:30:11.058 --> 01:30:13.038
I don't know.

01:30:13.138 --> 01:30:16.199
I think... I think they're from "you know".

01:30:16.299 --> 01:30:18.597
Someplace with similar conditions.

01:30:18.697 --> 01:30:21.359
- Cold, intense pressure.
- Oh, man!

01:30:21.459 --> 01:30:24.570
Happy as hogs in a waller down there,
probably.

01:31:20.693 --> 01:31:22.684
Sniff something?

01:31:25.973 --> 01:31:27.964
Did you, rat boy?

01:31:32.609 --> 01:31:33.609
Hey!

01:31:34.418 --> 01:31:35.755
Freeze!

01:31:35.855 --> 01:31:38.055
Don't move!

01:31:38.174 --> 01:31:39.887
That's right.

01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:43.157
- OK, Hip?
- They're using Big Geek

01:31:43.257 --> 01:31:45.633
- to take the bomb to the NTIs.
- What?

01:31:45.733 --> 01:31:47.677
We set it up to go right to 'em.

01:31:47.777 --> 01:31:49.361
Oh, my God!

01:31:51.609 --> 01:31:54.355
Take this. We're going to Phase Three.

01:31:54.455 --> 01:31:56.674
What? We don't have orders for that!

01:31:56.774 --> 01:32:01.154
I programmed Big Geek to go down to the
bottom of the trench and shoot some video.

01:32:01.254 --> 01:32:03.809
- Now they got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey.

01:32:07.209 --> 01:32:11.435
Coffey... Come on, Coffey.
Just think about what you're doing, OK?

01:32:11.535 --> 01:32:13.759
Just think about what you're doing!

01:32:14.449 --> 01:32:16.249
Get back!

01:32:16.774 --> 01:32:20.921
This is something I've wanted to do
since we first met.

01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:30.120
Take it easy.

01:32:32.849 --> 01:32:36.995
- All right! Into the kitchen! Let's go! Move!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

01:32:37.095 --> 01:32:39.074
I know the way.

01:32:39.174 --> 01:32:42.197
Your boss is fixin' to pull the pin
on 50 kilotons.

01:32:42.297 --> 01:32:44.636
And we're all gonna be ringside!

01:32:44.736 --> 01:32:46.714
He's havin' a full-on meltdown!

01:32:46.814 --> 01:32:49.316
- What's the timer set for?
- Three hours.

01:32:49.416 --> 01:32:51.517
- Shut up! Don't talk.
- Three hours.

01:32:51.617 --> 01:32:54.877
We can't get to minimum safe distance
in three hours.

01:32:54.977 --> 01:32:58.035
We can't go to Phase Three.
What about these people?

01:32:58.135 --> 01:33:00.359
Shut up! What's the matter with you?

01:33:06.529 --> 01:33:10.158
Everybody just stay calm.
The situation is under control.

01:33:15.529 --> 01:33:17.838
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.

01:33:21.969 --> 01:33:25.434
Shoenick! Your lieutenant's
about to make a real bad career move!

01:33:25.534 --> 01:33:27.833
The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat!

01:33:27.933 --> 01:33:30.995
- Can't you see he's lost it?
- Shut up!

01:33:31.095 --> 01:33:33.516
- The shock wave'll kill us.
- Quiet!

01:33:33.616 --> 01:33:35.717
It'll crush this rig like a beer can.

01:33:35.817 --> 01:33:38.156
- Shut up, man!
- We gotta stop him.

01:33:38.256 --> 01:33:39.638
Shut up!

01:33:39.738 --> 01:33:43.358
This is not our mission.
We can't detonate without orders.

01:33:57.009 --> 01:33:59.675
He's about to declare war on an alien species

01:33:59.775 --> 01:34:02.994
just when they're trying
to make contact with us. Please!

01:34:03.094 --> 01:34:06.968
- I don't know. I think I'm reaching him.
- Yeah!

01:34:08.089 --> 01:34:10.080
I'll be damned.

01:34:12.929 --> 01:34:14.920
- Jammer.
- Is everybody OK?

01:34:16.049 --> 01:34:17.649
Oh, man!

01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:21.677
- Don't move, jarface!
- Look, I'm the least of your problems.

01:34:21.777 --> 01:34:24.595
Take it easy, Hippy.
How you feeling, big guy?

01:34:24.695 --> 01:34:26.680
I'm OK, Bud. I...

01:34:27.329 --> 01:34:32.642
I just... figured I was dead back there
when I saw that angel coming for me.

01:34:35.729 --> 01:34:38.926
Yeah, OK.
Yeah. Why don't you tell us about it later?

01:34:45.489 --> 01:34:48.395
- Come on.
- He's got it tied off with something.

01:34:48.495 --> 01:34:50.480
Come on. Ready?

01:34:53.329 --> 01:34:57.447
- We're not gonna be able to budge it.
- Now what? This is the only door to sub-bay.

01:35:09.049 --> 01:35:12.077
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna swim to hatch six.

01:35:12.177 --> 01:35:13.377
What?!

01:35:14.254 --> 01:35:16.117
I'm gonna get inside

01:35:16.217 --> 01:35:19.997
- and open the door from the other side.
- Bud, this water is freezing.

01:35:20.889 --> 01:35:23.555
Then I guess you'd better wish me luck, huh?

01:35:23.655 --> 01:35:25.996
- Wish us luck.
- You comin' along?

01:35:26.096 --> 01:35:27.442
Looks that way.

01:35:28.769 --> 01:35:31.522
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.

01:35:32.169 --> 01:35:35.357
- In case I don't die...
- This is insane.

01:35:35.457 --> 01:35:38.885
Come on, Bud.
Let's go, pardner. I ain't got all day.

01:36:36.089 --> 01:36:38.080
Come on. Yank on it.

01:36:43.449 --> 01:36:45.434
We have to...

01:36:45.534 --> 01:36:47.514
We have to go to the moon pool.

01:36:47.614 --> 01:36:50.116
- It's the only way.
- I can't.

01:36:50.216 --> 01:36:52.396
I can't make it, pardner.

01:36:52.496 --> 01:36:54.480
I'm sorry.

01:36:55.849 --> 01:36:57.449
OK, Cat.

01:36:58.333 --> 01:37:00.320
You head on back, all right?

01:38:30.529 --> 01:38:33.238
- What is he doing?
- He can't make it to the door.

01:38:33.338 --> 01:38:37.677
- He's gonna try and take him out himself.
- No. God, he couldn't be that dumb.

01:38:37.777 --> 01:38:39.805
That guy's a trained killer.

01:39:26.929 --> 01:39:27.929
No!

01:39:28.418 --> 01:39:30.969
Coffey... Coffey, listen.

01:39:44.129 --> 01:39:45.129
Hey!

01:41:01.769 --> 01:41:02.769
Hey!

01:41:18.769 --> 01:41:21.602
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!

01:41:27.289 --> 01:41:30.486
- He's dogged it, Bud!
- We gotta get this off of here.

01:41:33.889 --> 01:41:36.198
Come on. Help me. Pull the gripper!

01:41:47.329 --> 01:41:49.320
Cat, get the door!

01:41:58.409 --> 01:41:59.409
Shit!

01:42:00.529 --> 01:42:01.928
Come on!

01:42:03.489 --> 01:42:04.516
Shoot!

01:42:04.616 --> 01:42:05.607
You all right?

01:42:05.707 --> 01:42:07.717
The safety's on!

01:42:07.817 --> 01:42:09.765
Give me that!

01:42:14.169 --> 01:42:17.676
Come on! Let's go! Help me out!
Gimme a hand. Let's move it.

01:42:17.776 --> 01:42:21.284
- One Night, what about Cab 1?
- Ready to launch.

01:42:22.209 --> 01:42:24.875
Go! You're better in these than I am.

01:42:24.975 --> 01:42:27.085
You got air? Come on.

01:42:29.289 --> 01:42:31.359
You got air.

01:43:20.969 --> 01:43:21.969
Shit!

01:44:49.969 --> 01:44:53.439
Bud, get out of the way!

01:44:58.969 --> 01:44:59.969
Shit!

01:45:21.729 --> 01:45:23.720
Get in! Hurry up!

01:45:24.329 --> 01:45:27.526
I'm comin', baby! Keep your pantyhose on.

01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:38.640
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:45:42.129 --> 01:45:44.927
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah. Right out in front.

01:45:52.809 --> 01:45:55.113
Oh, my God! OK. Get on the arm.

01:45:55.213 --> 01:45:58.195
- To the left. A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

01:45:58.295 --> 01:45:59.695
Steady.

01:46:00.055 --> 01:46:01.555
- Grab it!
- Yeah, got it!

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:04.395
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

01:46:04.495 --> 01:46:07.003
- Hold it still.
- I am.

01:46:17.249 --> 01:46:19.240
Shit! We lost Geek!

01:46:24.969 --> 01:46:26.997
Where is he, Bud? Do you see him?

01:46:27.097 --> 01:46:29.045
I'll take a look.

01:46:30.729 --> 01:46:33.163
- He's comin' up fast. Step on it!
- Shit!

01:46:43.729 --> 01:46:47.005
- Go to the right! Swing to the right!
- Shit!

01:47:01.889 --> 01:47:03.880
Keep movin', baby!

01:47:05.729 --> 01:47:06.729
Come here.

01:47:13.169 --> 01:47:14.488
Son of a bitch!

01:47:21.929 --> 01:47:24.159
Hard left, baby! Left!

01:47:37.809 --> 01:47:39.358
Jesus Christ, lady!

01:47:39.458 --> 01:47:41.963
If you think you can do any better,
you're welcome!

01:47:48.129 --> 01:47:50.120
Son of a bitch!

01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:54.754
- Is he right on us?
- Right on your ass.

01:47:54.854 --> 01:47:55.854
OK.

01:47:56.338 --> 01:47:58.320
- Where you goin'?
- Hang on!

01:49:38.129 --> 01:49:40.359
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Do you read?

01:49:42.569 --> 01:49:45.367
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

01:49:47.569 --> 01:49:49.560
I'm not getting any answer!

01:49:50.289 --> 01:49:52.716
And we're flooding like a son of a bitch.

01:49:52.816 --> 01:49:54.794
Yeah. You noticed?

01:49:54.894 --> 01:49:56.874
You did OK back there, Virgil.

01:49:56.974 --> 01:49:59.997
- I was fairly impressed.
- Yeah, well, not good enough.

01:50:00.097 --> 01:50:03.873
- We still gotta catch Big Geek.
- Yeah, well, not in this thing.

01:50:03.973 --> 01:50:06.483
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1. Over.

01:50:09.809 --> 01:50:11.555
Try it again.

01:50:11.655 --> 01:50:13.605
Deepcore, this is Cab 1. We need a...

01:50:17.009 --> 01:50:18.283
You all right?

01:50:19.409 --> 01:50:20.409
Yeah.

01:50:26.609 --> 01:50:27.998
Well, that's that.

01:50:28.098 --> 01:50:30.080
Yeah, wonderful.

01:50:30.889 --> 01:50:34.274
There's some light comin' from somewhere.
Off to the right.

01:50:34.374 --> 01:50:36.354
Yeah, that's the rig.

01:50:36.454 --> 01:50:38.434
It's a good 60, 70 yards, I'd say.

01:50:38.534 --> 01:50:40.514
Well, they'll come after us.

01:50:40.614 --> 01:50:45.364
Yeah, but it's gonna take 'em a while to get
here. We gotta get this flooding stopped.

01:50:47.689 --> 01:50:50.957
- Can you see where it's coming in?
- Yeah. Can you hold the lamp?

01:50:51.057 --> 01:50:56.203
There's a busted fitting behind this panel.
Problem is I don't think I can get to it.

01:50:58.009 --> 01:51:01.394
- You got any tools?
- Uh, I don't know. I'll have to look around.

01:51:01.494 --> 01:51:03.480
Yeah, well, I looked already.

01:51:05.489 --> 01:51:08.845
Goddamn it!
All I need's a goddamn crescent wrench!

01:51:11.089 --> 01:51:12.689
Come on.

01:51:18.329 --> 01:51:20.314
Son of a bitch!

01:51:20.414 --> 01:51:22.240
OK. Calm down, Bud.

01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:25.200
- Calm down.
- OK.

01:51:28.249 --> 01:51:29.249
OK.

01:51:31.969 --> 01:51:33.954
We gotta get you outta here.

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:36.034
- How?
- I don't know how.

01:51:36.134 --> 01:51:39.876
- All right. We've only got one suit.
- We gotta come up with something.

01:51:39.976 --> 01:51:43.556
- Oh, my God! I'm freezing!
- Come here. Give me your hands.

01:51:43.656 --> 01:51:47.353
Listen, you're smart. Think of something.
Can't you think of something?

01:51:47.453 --> 01:51:50.759
OK. Why don't you swim back to the rig
and bring back another suit?

01:51:52.249 --> 01:51:57.721
That'll take me about seven or eight minutes
to swim, get the gear, and come back.

01:51:58.729 --> 01:52:01.997
I wouldn't make it.
By the time I got back, you'd be...

01:52:02.097 --> 01:52:03.097
OK.

01:52:03.498 --> 01:52:06.640
Let's look around. Let's look. Oh, my God!

01:52:08.729 --> 01:52:10.720
Is that working?

01:52:11.449 --> 01:52:12.449
Shit!

01:52:23.449 --> 01:52:25.041
All right.

01:52:25.889 --> 01:52:27.475
Here. You put this on.

01:52:27.575 --> 01:52:31.236
- No! Are you growing gills all of a sudden?
- Don't argue with me, goddamn it!

01:52:31.336 --> 01:52:35.757
- This is not an option, so forget about it!
- Lindsey, shut up and put this thing on!

01:52:35.857 --> 01:52:38.558
- If you'd be logical...
- Fuck logic!

01:52:38.658 --> 01:52:42.598
Listen to me. You've got the suit on
and you're a better swimmer than I am, right?

01:52:42.698 --> 01:52:45.515
- Yeah, maybe.
- Right? Yes! So I've got a plan.

01:52:45.615 --> 01:52:48.595
- What's the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me back to the rig.

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:49.695
No!

01:52:50.135 --> 01:52:53.317
Yes! This water's only
a couple of degrees above freezing.

01:52:53.417 --> 01:52:57.475
I'll... go into deep hypothermia.
My blood'll go like ice water.

01:52:57.575 --> 01:53:00.597
My body systems will slow down.
They won't stop.

01:53:00.697 --> 01:53:04.878
You tow me back and I can...
I can be revived after maybe

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:07.795
- 10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on! You put it on!

01:53:07.895 --> 01:53:11.636
It's the only way! You just put this on!
Put this on. You know I'm right.

01:53:11.736 --> 01:53:16.796
Please! It's the only way. You've got
all the... stuff on the rig to do this.

01:53:16.896 --> 01:53:19.084
Put this on. Bud, please!

01:53:20.249 --> 01:53:22.234
- This is insane.
- I know.

01:53:22.334 --> 01:53:24.314
Oh, my God.

01:53:24.414 --> 01:53:26.394
- Are you OK?
- It's the only way.

01:53:26.494 --> 01:53:28.480
All right. Here. Hold this.

01:53:30.809 --> 01:53:32.800
Son of a bitch. Hold on, Lindsey.

01:53:35.289 --> 01:53:37.280
You can do this, you know.

01:53:42.009 --> 01:53:44.436
- You can do this.
- God, Lins... I...

01:53:44.536 --> 01:53:46.520
I know. You can tell me later.

01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:06.199
This is maybe not such a good idea!

01:54:07.809 --> 01:54:09.208
Oh, my God!

01:54:10.289 --> 01:54:11.889
Bud! No!

01:54:20.929 --> 01:54:23.966
I can't! Oh, Bud, I'm scared!

01:54:53.929 --> 01:54:54.929
No!

01:55:18.889 --> 01:55:20.438
I got him!

01:55:20.538 --> 01:55:22.674
- Where?
- Oh, my God! It's Lindsey.

01:55:22.774 --> 01:55:25.835
- Deepcore, do you read? Over.
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.

01:55:25.935 --> 01:55:28.074
- We're here.
- Go to the infirmary.

01:55:28.174 --> 01:55:30.958
Get the cart oxygen, defib kit,

01:55:31.058 --> 01:55:35.834
adrenaline in a 10cc syringe,
and some heating blankets. You got all that?

01:55:35.934 --> 01:55:38.595
- Got it.
- Meet me at the moon pool and make it fast!

01:55:38.695 --> 01:55:40.238
Now! Come on! Let's go!

01:55:40.338 --> 01:55:42.314
Hippy, get the hot packs!

01:55:42.414 --> 01:55:44.014
Got 'em!

01:55:59.129 --> 01:56:01.484
Here he comes!

01:56:08.209 --> 01:56:10.354
- Watch her head.
- I got it. I got it.

01:56:10.454 --> 01:56:12.440
Watch her feet.

01:56:14.209 --> 01:56:16.518
Watch her head comin' down. Watch...

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.236
Clear it out. Is she clear?

01:56:25.336 --> 01:56:27.596
Get the defib ready. Hurry up, Cat.

01:56:27.696 --> 01:56:29.680
OK. Got it.

01:56:31.049 --> 01:56:33.034
- OK?
- Yeah.

01:56:33.134 --> 01:56:35.636
Three one thousand... four one thousand...

01:56:35.736 --> 01:56:37.336
Breathe.

01:56:37.814 --> 01:56:41.274
One one thousand...
two one thousand... three one thousand...

01:56:41.374 --> 01:56:44.557
No! You gotta have bare skin or it won't work!

01:56:44.657 --> 01:56:47.395
Three one thousand... four one thousand...

01:56:47.495 --> 01:56:48.495
Here.

01:56:49.414 --> 01:56:51.118
Is that right?

01:56:51.218 --> 01:56:52.875
- I got it.
- Well, do it!

01:56:52.975 --> 01:56:54.575
Breathe!

01:56:55.017 --> 01:56:57.569
- Come on! Zap her!
- Clear!

01:56:58.809 --> 01:57:01.193
- Come on, baby! Oh, Christ!
- Nothing.

01:57:01.293 --> 01:57:02.875
Breathe.

01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:07.434
- I'll jack it up to three hundred.
- Do it again, One Night. Zap her again.

01:57:07.534 --> 01:57:09.956
It's going, it's going. It's charging.

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:12.040
Charging...

01:57:13.209 --> 01:57:14.528
- Now!
- Clear!

01:57:16.049 --> 01:57:18.034
- Anything?
- No pulse.

01:57:18.134 --> 01:57:20.556
- Come on, baby!
- Charging one more time.

01:57:20.656 --> 01:57:22.844
Zap her again. Come on!

01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:26.160
- Come on!
- Clear!

01:57:28.249 --> 01:57:30.234
God! No pulse.

01:57:30.334 --> 01:57:32.474
It's flat. Goddamn! It's flat.

01:57:32.574 --> 01:57:34.677
Get outta here.

01:57:34.777 --> 01:57:38.037
One, two, three, four, five one thousand.

01:57:38.137 --> 01:57:40.643
One, two, three, four... breathe!

01:57:41.009 --> 01:57:44.160
One, two, three, four... breathe!

01:57:50.169 --> 01:57:53.836
Come on, baby.
One one thousand, two one thousand,

01:57:53.936 --> 01:57:57.037
three one thousand, four one thousand...

01:57:57.137 --> 01:58:01.477
Come on, baby. One one thousand,
two one thousand, three one thousand...

01:58:01.577 --> 01:58:05.475
Come on, baby! Breathe! Come on!
Two one thousand, three one thousand...

01:58:05.575 --> 01:58:06.775
Bud...

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:12.040
It's all over, man.

01:58:14.569 --> 01:58:16.554
It's all over.

01:58:16.654 --> 01:58:18.654
I'm sorry.

01:58:18.936 --> 01:58:20.736
No pulse.

01:58:42.049 --> 01:58:43.049
No!

01:58:44.134 --> 01:58:46.636
No, she has a strong heart!
She wants to live!

01:58:46.736 --> 01:58:48.720
Come on, Lins! Come on, baby!

01:59:20.889 --> 01:59:23.316
- Zap her again! Do it!
- Charging.

01:59:23.416 --> 01:59:24.616
Do it!

01:59:31.289 --> 01:59:32.284
Clear.

01:59:32.384 --> 01:59:33.579
Clear!

01:59:36.409 --> 01:59:38.400
Get outta here!

01:59:44.609 --> 01:59:47.435
Come on. Breathe, baby.
Goddamn it! Breathe!

01:59:47.535 --> 01:59:52.074
Goddamn it, you bitch! You never backed
away from anything in your life! Now fight!

01:59:52.174 --> 01:59:53.374
Fight!

01:59:54.254 --> 01:59:56.436
Right now! Do it!

01:59:56.536 --> 01:59:58.520
Fight, goddamn it!

01:59:59.369 --> 02:00:00.569
Fight!

02:00:01.656 --> 02:00:02.856
Fight!

02:00:03.138 --> 02:00:04.338
Fight!

02:00:11.369 --> 02:00:13.354
Lins? That's it, Lindsey.

02:00:13.454 --> 02:00:15.434
That's it, Lins. You can do it.

02:00:15.534 --> 02:00:18.275
That's it, Lins. Come on back, baby. Come on.

02:00:18.375 --> 02:00:20.360
You can do it, baby.

02:00:29.769 --> 02:00:31.754
Get her some air.

02:00:31.854 --> 02:00:33.454
Breathe.

02:00:37.489 --> 02:00:39.474
You did it, ace!

02:00:39.574 --> 02:00:40.574
God!

02:00:54.849 --> 02:00:56.840
Make sure her heart's OK.

02:01:13.089 --> 02:01:15.080
Big boys don't cry, remember?

02:01:21.249 --> 02:01:23.049
Hi, lady.

02:01:24.289 --> 02:01:26.280
Hi, tough guy.

02:01:29.169 --> 02:01:31.154
I guess it worked, didn't it?

02:01:31.254 --> 02:01:33.240
Yeah. Of course it did.

02:01:34.529 --> 02:01:36.520
You're never wrong, are you?

02:01:39.209 --> 02:01:41.796
How you feelin'?

02:01:41.896 --> 02:01:43.880
I feel better.

02:01:45.129 --> 02:01:47.199
What did you do to me?

02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:54.720
Next time it's your turn, OK?

02:01:57.449 --> 02:01:59.440
Yeah, you got that right.

02:02:00.529 --> 02:02:05.037
These are so your eyes can focus
in the breathing fluid. How's that feel?

02:02:05.137 --> 02:02:07.795
If you can't see, you can't disarm the bomb.

02:02:07.895 --> 02:02:11.484
OK. With this much weight,
you're gonna fall like a brick.

02:02:12.769 --> 02:02:16.958
We've still got about an hour,
so you should get there in plenty of time.

02:02:17.058 --> 02:02:22.282
When you get down there, all you gotta do is
cut a wire, drop the weights and come home.

02:02:25.049 --> 02:02:29.486
- Hand me that wrench.
- Maybe I oughta check everything.

02:02:31.529 --> 02:02:34.275
That's loose. I'll fix that up.

02:02:34.375 --> 02:02:37.281
Bud, you don't have to do this.

02:02:37.929 --> 02:02:39.914
Somebody's gotta do it.

02:02:40.014 --> 02:02:41.957
It doesn't have to be you.

02:02:42.057 --> 02:02:43.857
Who then?

02:02:48.289 --> 02:02:51.594
So, what, I can hear you
but I can't talk, right?

02:02:51.694 --> 02:02:54.877
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound. Excuse me.

02:02:54.977 --> 02:02:57.715
- It'll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

02:02:57.815 --> 02:03:01.165
I gotta warn you all... I'm a pretty lousy typist.

02:03:04.809 --> 02:03:06.765
The moment of truth.

02:03:08.049 --> 02:03:10.040
Come on. Let's go.

02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:11.729
Easy.

02:03:14.409 --> 02:03:16.756
- I need it in the front a little bit.
- OK.

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:19.436
- Thank you.
- You got it.

02:03:19.536 --> 02:03:21.158
- Set.
- Clamp?

02:03:21.258 --> 02:03:22.258
Set.

02:03:32.329 --> 02:03:34.958
OK, let's rock and roll!

02:03:35.058 --> 02:03:36.858
Crack it.

02:03:37.489 --> 02:03:39.639
Headset, please.

02:03:41.729 --> 02:03:43.765
- OK.
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

02:03:45.169 --> 02:03:46.878
- Bud.
- Relax now, Bud.

02:03:46.978 --> 02:03:47.968
Watch me.

02:03:48.068 --> 02:03:50.077
OK? Watch me. Watch me.

02:03:50.177 --> 02:03:52.633
Don't hold your breath. Take it in.

02:03:52.733 --> 02:03:55.402
Just let yourself take it in. Take it in.

02:03:57.129 --> 02:04:00.157
That's it. Don't hold your breath now.
There you go.

02:04:00.257 --> 02:04:02.958
Don't hold your breath. Take it in. That's it.

02:04:03.058 --> 02:04:05.678
- There you go.
- Bud!

02:04:05.778 --> 02:04:07.594
This is not normal!

02:04:07.694 --> 02:04:10.957
It's normal! Itâ€™ll pass in a second!
It's perfectly normal!

02:04:11.057 --> 02:04:13.353
- It's not normal.
- It's perfectly normal.

02:04:13.453 --> 02:04:17.638
We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.
Your body will remember. That's it.

02:04:17.738 --> 02:04:19.738
That's it.

02:04:19.857 --> 02:04:22.558
- Perfectly normal.
- Christ! He's breathing!

02:04:22.658 --> 02:04:24.640
Give me that.

02:04:25.449 --> 02:04:27.833
- Can you hear me?
- There he goes.

02:04:27.933 --> 02:04:30.313
Yes? OK. Bud...

02:04:30.413 --> 02:04:32.718
Try your keypad.

02:04:46.569 --> 02:04:48.525
I already have.

02:04:50.889 --> 02:04:52.089
Great.

02:04:52.937 --> 02:04:54.737
Let's go!

02:05:00.609 --> 02:05:03.116
- Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.

02:05:03.216 --> 02:05:04.216
Easy.

02:05:05.337 --> 02:05:07.923
Watch out. Watch his back. Watch the back.

02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:10.769
Careful.

02:05:12.689 --> 02:05:16.516
I redid Little Geek's chip
the same as Big Geek!

02:05:16.616 --> 02:05:18.754
It should take you straight there!

02:05:18.854 --> 02:05:21.204
All you have to do is hang on!

02:07:03.168 --> 02:07:05.153
What's his depth?

02:07:05.253 --> 02:07:07.914
- 3200 feet.
- Your depth is 3200 feet.

02:07:08.014 --> 02:07:11.675
You're doing fine. Now,
you better watch out for crane wreckage.

02:07:11.775 --> 02:07:13.838
You should be almost to it.

02:07:23.968 --> 02:07:25.953
4800 feet. It's official.

02:07:26.053 --> 02:07:27.053
Yeah.

02:07:27.777 --> 02:07:31.637
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

02:07:31.737 --> 02:07:35.403
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this
when you got up this morning, huh?

02:07:43.848 --> 02:07:46.840
One mile down. Still grinnin'.

02:08:01.808 --> 02:08:03.799
8500 feet.

02:08:05.088 --> 02:08:07.073
8500 feet, Bud.

02:08:07.173 --> 02:08:09.159
Everything OK?

02:08:10.688 --> 02:08:15.079
Ask him about pressure effects.
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

02:08:16.208 --> 02:08:18.597
Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel.

02:08:30.288 --> 02:08:33.316
It's starting. It hits the nervous system first.

02:08:33.416 --> 02:08:35.436
Keep talking. Let him hear your voice.

02:08:35.536 --> 02:08:37.513
OK, Bud. Your depth is 8900 feet.

02:08:37.613 --> 02:08:41.036
- You're doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.

02:08:41.136 --> 02:08:43.119
Talk to him.

02:08:49.768 --> 02:08:50.968
Bud...

02:08:52.013 --> 02:08:55.318
There's some... some things I need to say.

02:08:57.048 --> 02:08:59.039
It's hard for me, you know.

02:09:00.528 --> 02:09:02.917
It's not easy being a cast-iron bitch.

02:09:03.568 --> 02:09:06.676
It takes discipline and years of training.

02:09:06.776 --> 02:09:09.282
A lot of people don't appreciate that.

02:09:12.768 --> 02:09:16.392
Jesus, I'm sorry
I can't tell you these things to your face.

02:09:16.492 --> 02:09:18.160
I have to wait till you're alone in the dark,

02:09:19.246 --> 02:09:23.034
freezing, and there's 10,000 feet
of water between us.

02:09:24.686 --> 02:09:26.881
I'm sorry. I'm rambling.

02:09:39.606 --> 02:09:41.642
Comin' up on the big ten thou.

02:09:48.166 --> 02:09:50.151
12,000 feet. Jesus!

02:09:50.251 --> 02:09:52.550
- I don't believe he's doin' this!
- Hippy!

02:09:52.650 --> 02:09:55.319
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

02:09:58.326 --> 02:10:00.317
Bud, how are you doing?

02:10:01.486 --> 02:10:03.311
Signal's fading.

02:10:03.411 --> 02:10:06.551
No! No, Bud, I'm not going away.
I'm right here.

02:10:06.651 --> 02:10:10.430
Kill everything we don't need.
Knock out those exterior lights. Go! Go!

02:10:10.530 --> 02:10:13.954
Run it through the digital processor!
Cook it as much as you can!

02:10:14.054 --> 02:10:16.031
I am right here with you, Bud.

02:10:16.131 --> 02:10:18.074
Bud, this is Lindsey.

02:10:18.174 --> 02:10:21.115
Please. I'm right here with you.

02:10:21.215 --> 02:10:24.881
OK? So try and stay calm.
I'm right here, all right?

02:10:30.766 --> 02:10:31.766
Bud.

02:10:34.366 --> 02:10:35.835
He's losing it.

02:10:35.935 --> 02:10:39.513
- Talk to him. Keep him with us.
- Comin' up on 16,000 feet.

02:10:39.613 --> 02:10:41.990
No, Bud, it's the pressure, all right?

02:10:42.090 --> 02:10:44.832
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try.

02:10:44.932 --> 02:10:48.710
Concentrate, all right?
Just listen to my voice. Please.

02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:50.914
17,000 feet.

02:10:51.014 --> 02:10:53.433
Christ almighty, this is insane.

02:10:53.533 --> 02:10:55.517
Bud? I'm not getting anything!

02:11:01.246 --> 02:11:03.593
- Whoa! Come on! No!
- What?

02:11:03.693 --> 02:11:05.836
- Little Geek just folded.
- Jesus.

02:11:54.402 --> 02:11:56.358
He can still make it.

02:11:57.842 --> 02:11:58.842
OK.

02:12:01.482 --> 02:12:02.482
Bud?

02:12:03.690 --> 02:12:05.673
I know how alone you feel.

02:12:07.962 --> 02:12:11.477
Alone in all that... cold... blackness.

02:12:15.522 --> 02:12:19.231
But I'm there in the dark with you.
Oh, Bud. You're not alone.

02:12:23.322 --> 02:12:24.922
Oh, God!

02:12:25.407 --> 02:12:27.387
You remember that time...

02:12:27.487 --> 02:12:30.867
You were pretty drunk.
You probably don't remember.

02:12:30.967 --> 02:12:35.160
The power went out in that little apartment
we had on Orange Street.

02:12:35.922 --> 02:12:40.909
We were staring at that one little candle
and I said something really dumb like...

02:12:41.009 --> 02:12:42.993
..."That candle is me, like...

02:12:43.882 --> 02:12:48.319
like every one of us is out there
alone in the dark in this life."

02:12:50.162 --> 02:12:54.867
And you just... you just lit up another candle
and you put it beside mine,

02:12:54.967 --> 02:12:57.874
and you said "No. See, that's me. That's me."

02:12:59.002 --> 02:13:01.675
And we stared at the two candles and then...

02:13:04.562 --> 02:13:08.874
Well, if you remember any of this,
I'm sure you remember the next part.

02:13:11.762 --> 02:13:14.071
But there are two candles in the dark.

02:13:16.202 --> 02:13:18.187
I'm with you.

02:13:18.287 --> 02:13:21.035
I'll always be with you, Bud. I promise that.

02:13:34.162 --> 02:13:36.153
How you doin', pardner?

02:13:37.202 --> 02:13:39.193
You still with us? Come back.

02:13:40.242 --> 02:13:42.227
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

02:13:42.327 --> 02:13:44.307
- Come on.
- Bud?

02:13:44.407 --> 02:13:46.387
Talk to me, Bud.

02:13:46.487 --> 02:13:48.866
Now, come on. You hangin' in there?

02:13:48.966 --> 02:13:51.911
You have to talk to me, Bud! Please!

02:13:52.011 --> 02:13:54.721
I need to know if you're OK.

02:14:08.042 --> 02:14:10.229
You... you see light?

02:14:10.329 --> 02:14:11.880
What kind of light, Bud?

02:14:13.802 --> 02:14:16.032
He's hallucinating badly.

02:14:38.239 --> 02:14:40.469
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.

02:14:43.359 --> 02:14:44.748
OK, Bud.

02:14:44.848 --> 02:14:46.824
We'll go step by step.

02:14:46.924 --> 02:14:51.347
Remove the detonator housing
by unscrewing it

02:14:51.447 --> 02:14:53.430
counterclockwise.

02:15:22.279 --> 02:15:25.185
All right, Bud. You have to cut

02:15:25.285 --> 02:15:28.345
the ground wire. Not the lead wire.

02:15:28.445 --> 02:15:30.946
It's the blue wire with the white stripe.

02:15:31.046 --> 02:15:33.846
Not, I repeat,

02:15:34.646 --> 02:15:37.153
not the black wire with the yellow stripe.

02:16:31.519 --> 02:16:33.504
Quiet! Save your air.

02:16:33.603 --> 02:16:36.192
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

02:16:43.439 --> 02:16:44.439
What?

02:16:46.279 --> 02:16:49.147
- It took him 30 minutes to get there!
- Bud! Do you hear me?

02:16:49.248 --> 02:16:51.304
You drop your weights and start back now!

02:16:51.404 --> 02:16:54.348
That gauge could be wrong. Do you hear me?

02:16:54.448 --> 02:16:58.665
Just drop your weights and start back now!
Your gauge could be wrong!

02:16:58.764 --> 02:17:03.116
Your gauge could be wrong!
You drop your weights and start back now!

02:17:07.039 --> 02:17:11.547
You won't stay there. You drop your weights.
You can breathe shallow! Do you hear me?

02:17:11.647 --> 02:17:14.226
Bud, please listen to me! Please! Goddamn it!

02:17:14.325 --> 02:17:16.825
You dragged me back
from that bottomless pit!

02:17:16.925 --> 02:17:20.144
You can't leave me here alone now. Please!

02:17:20.244 --> 02:17:22.543
Oh, God, Virgil! Please!

02:17:22.643 --> 02:17:24.043
Please!

02:18:03.959 --> 02:18:05.950
I love you.

02:22:59.157 --> 02:23:00.357
Howdy.

02:23:01.242 --> 02:23:04.115
How are you guys doin'?

02:23:09.317 --> 02:23:13.586
Attempts to convene a summit
between heads of state have collapsed...

02:23:13.686 --> 02:23:16.663
The Soviet build-up of tanks and aircraft has...

02:23:16.763 --> 02:23:20.866
All citizens to stay on their jobs,
restrict unnecessary travel...

02:23:20.966 --> 02:23:23.464
...what officials are calling
an unprovoked attack.

02:23:23.564 --> 02:23:24.555
Oh, shit!

02:23:24.655 --> 02:23:27.862
Across the country,
National Guard units have been mobilised

02:23:27.962 --> 02:23:31.472
and all civil defence volunteers
have been called to full-time duty.

02:23:33.997 --> 02:23:36.983
You watch our TV.
That's what you're telling me.

02:23:37.083 --> 02:23:40.505
- You know what's going on up there.
- Seismologists are reporting

02:23:40.605 --> 02:23:43.785
an enormous disturbance
throughout the world's oceans

02:23:43.885 --> 02:23:46.261
which apparently began
about 15 minutes ago.

02:23:46.361 --> 02:23:50.982
They are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis,
but with no apparent seismological source.

02:23:51.082 --> 02:23:54.664
The waves are propagating towards
the shorelines of every continent.

02:23:54.764 --> 02:23:57.386
- I'm sorry. That's...
- Dr Berg, would you please...

02:23:57.486 --> 02:23:59.585
Young lady. Young lady, listen to me.

02:23:59.685 --> 02:24:03.033
I don't know. We don't know
what's going on yet. We don't have a clue.

02:24:04.317 --> 02:24:06.542
The horizon has already grown dark.

02:24:06.642 --> 02:24:09.745
People are running everywhere.
It's sheer panic.

02:24:09.845 --> 02:24:11.183
Stay on me!

02:24:11.283 --> 02:24:15.306
The wave... the wave is,
I don't know, maybe 1,000 feet high already.

02:24:15.406 --> 02:24:17.382
Getting bigger as I'm watching,

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.462
still miles out.

02:24:19.562 --> 02:24:21.382
- My God!
- Get outta here!

02:24:21.482 --> 02:24:23.186
No! Stay! We're staying!

02:24:23.286 --> 02:24:24.703
Give it to me, then!

02:24:24.803 --> 02:24:28.262
I don't even know if I'm still broadcasting.
I can't be sure.

02:24:28.362 --> 02:24:30.587
I'll just keep going as long as I can.

02:24:35.197 --> 02:24:37.188
You guys are doing this.

02:24:39.157 --> 02:24:42.505
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.

02:24:42.605 --> 02:24:45.794
That's your technology,
but why are you doing this?

02:25:05.077 --> 02:25:09.063
OK. That's enough. I get the point!

02:25:09.163 --> 02:25:11.142
How do you know

02:25:11.242 --> 02:25:13.228
they're really gonna do it?

02:25:14.477 --> 02:25:18.304
Where do you get off passing judgement
on us? You can't be sure.

02:25:18.404 --> 02:25:20.274
How do you know?

02:28:08.157 --> 02:28:10.148
You could've done it.

02:28:12.437 --> 02:28:14.428
Why didn't you?

02:29:29.997 --> 02:29:33.025
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

02:29:33.125 --> 02:29:35.544
Do you hear, Deepcore?

02:29:35.644 --> 02:29:38.754
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?

02:29:41.514 --> 02:29:44.950
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

02:29:46.634 --> 02:29:48.901
Hell, yes, we read! Good of you to join us!

02:29:49.001 --> 02:29:51.144
Copy, Deepcore. Hey, I've got 'em!

02:29:51.794 --> 02:29:53.779
How's that storm goin' up there?

02:29:53.879 --> 02:29:55.982
It just blew itself out all of a sudden.

02:29:56.082 --> 02:29:59.299
Well, hell, son.
You'd better get a line down to us.

02:29:59.399 --> 02:30:03.620
We're in moderately poor shape down here.
We've lost seven people, including Bud.

02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:06.512
And we're about out of O2,
so whatever you're gonna do...

02:30:09.032 --> 02:30:11.496
You make up your mind
how to get us outta here?

02:30:11.596 --> 02:30:13.423
They're talking about
flying in a DSRV from Norfolk.

02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:16.618
- I just wish I could've seen it.
- OK.

02:30:16.718 --> 02:30:18.695
How long's that gonna take?

02:30:18.795 --> 02:30:21.623
How do you stop
a half-mile-high tidal wave...

02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:27.430
Hey...

02:30:28.597 --> 02:30:31.058
- Hey! It's Bud!
- That's impossible.

02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:35.855
- No, it's not.
- Do you hear, Deepcore?

02:30:35.955 --> 02:30:36.955
Yes!

02:30:37.636 --> 02:30:40.259
Wait. We've got a message from Bud.

02:30:40.359 --> 02:30:43.069
- Bud?
- What's it say?

02:30:44.110 --> 02:30:45.110
Here.

02:30:46.195 --> 02:30:48.181
It says...

02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:52.620
It says "Virgil Brigman back on the air."

02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:07.739
"Have some new friends down here."

02:31:07.839 --> 02:31:10.185
"Guess they've been here a while."

02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:23.468
"They've left us alone, but it bothers them
to see us hurting each other."

02:31:27.310 --> 02:31:29.824
"Getting out of hand."

02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:39.739
"They sent a message. Hope you got it."

02:31:39.839 --> 02:31:42.779
I'd say that's a big ten-four, Jack.

02:31:42.879 --> 02:31:45.536
"They want us to grow up a bit

02:31:45.636 --> 02:31:48.064
and put away childish things."

02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:53.379
"Of course, it's just a suggestion."

02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:03.863
Looks like you boys
might be out of business.

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:15.375
What the hell's goin' on?

02:32:15.475 --> 02:32:17.774
One Night, get to sonar.

02:32:17.874 --> 02:32:19.383
Good God almighty!

02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:24.574
Fellas...
I'm gettin' some awful big readings here.

02:32:24.674 --> 02:32:27.299
- Something's comin' up the wall!
- What is it?

02:32:27.399 --> 02:32:29.381
Whatever it is, it's major!

02:32:59.310 --> 02:33:01.028
Something is definitely going on down there.

02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:06.537
Active is pinging back something really big.
It's huge!

02:33:06.637 --> 02:33:08.897
- It's coming up underneath us.
- Where?

02:33:08.997 --> 02:33:11.948
Where? It's everywhere!
There! Starboard bow!

02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:33.422
There! Look!

02:34:46.386 --> 02:34:48.377
Help, Cat!

02:35:17.346 --> 02:35:20.702
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.

02:35:23.169 --> 02:35:25.456
They must have done something to us.

02:35:26.989 --> 02:35:28.789
Oh, yeah.

02:35:29.377 --> 02:35:31.457
Yeah, I think you could say that.

02:36:18.986 --> 02:36:20.977
Hi, Brigman.

02:36:22.097 --> 02:36:23.911
Hi, Mrs Brigman.
