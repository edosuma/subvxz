WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:09.342
[Abigail] I've just really had a hard time

00:09.426 --> 00:11.428
adjusting to life at A-P.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.264
I love Winchester, but...

00:14.347 --> 00:18.059
I've actually had thoughts
about transferring to Smith.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.853
It's good enough for Barbara Bush.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.230
It's got to be good enough for me, right?

00:22.313 --> 00:24.107
[Coco] I don't know
what that sentence means,

00:24.190 --> 00:26.651
but I feel it may be part of your problem.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.319
I'm so confused.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.865
I, like, love black people. I do.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.408
I use cocoa butter.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.662
I just don't get why
they all hate me so much.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.747
[narrator]  While the ramifications

00:38.830 --> 00:41.624
of the Davis House disaster
were still surfacing,

00:41.708 --> 00:45.336
Coco seemed to be having
her best week ever.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.505
Take me to the moment
when you first sensed conflict

00:47.589 --> 00:48.548
with Keisha.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.718
Well, I had an assignment
for my Feminist Lit class,

00:51.801 --> 00:55.013
and Keisha was playing  Lemonade  on repeat.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.891
Suddenly, all of Emily Brontë's words

00:57.974 --> 00:59.934
became Beyoncé lyrics.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.938
Heathcliff was asking Catherine,
"What's worst?"

01:04.022 --> 01:06.274
and, "Who the fuck do you think I is?"

01:06.357 --> 01:09.527
Careful, this is bordering on shade.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.445
But continue.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.906
[James] I'm sorry to interrupt
whatever this is,

01:12.989 --> 01:14.616
but CORE's starting.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.784
[Coco] James, please.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.494
I'm talking to Abigail.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.037
Ain't nobody ever talk to Abigail.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.623
They don't. [sighs]

01:21.706 --> 01:23.333
-And so all day...
-[narrator]  In fact,

01:23.416 --> 01:25.043
there were hidden forces pushing Coco

01:25.126 --> 01:28.421
to an even greater next step
in her Winchester career.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.756
Watch closely.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.344
1947-- a personal library

01:34.427 --> 01:36.304
from one
of Winchester's first black students

01:36.387 --> 01:39.724
is discovered in the basement
of Armstrong-Parker.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.394
There they find documented accounts
of correspondence

01:43.478 --> 01:46.564
between Winchester's slaves
and its early black students

01:46.648 --> 01:50.527
detailing which faculty members
and families could be trusted.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.237
It was a short list.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.572
Excitement over the findings

01:54.656 --> 01:57.951
eventually leads to the forming of BSU,

01:58.034 --> 01:59.494
the Black Student Union,

01:59.577 --> 02:00.912
and over the next 20 years,

02:00.995 --> 02:03.998
the organization would continue to grow.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.335
1971-- after years of having

02:07.418 --> 02:09.754
the needs of women ignored by the BSU,

02:09.838 --> 02:11.631
Jeanette Daniels has had enough,

02:11.714 --> 02:14.175
and finding her boyfriend,
BSU president Carver Coleman,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.094
making out with his secretary of events

02:16.177 --> 02:18.429
-certainly doesn't help.
-Oh, wait, baby.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.889
[narrator]  Jeanette leaves BSU,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.183
taking a large contingent
of women with her,

02:22.267 --> 02:24.769
and forms the Coalition
for Racial Equality,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.604
also known as CORE.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.232
Thanks in no small part
to Jeanette's tenacity,

02:29.315 --> 02:31.734
CORE eventually becomes
the administration's only

02:31.818 --> 02:34.529
officially recognized group
to deal with diversity

02:34.612 --> 02:36.364
and to receive school funding.

02:36.948 --> 02:41.202
CORE's presidency remains
a much-coveted position to this day.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.581
Yeah, so Beyoncé is one
of very few physical manifestations

02:44.664 --> 02:47.876
of how Keisha aspires
to move through the world.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.296
So you didn't just ask
for headphones to be used.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.048
You effectively asked
for Keisha's silence.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.466
Plus slavery.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.386
Wow. I'm a monster.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.138
[Coco] You're welcome.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.306
Okay, I'm ready.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.725
Is it okay if I stay and listen?

03:03.808 --> 03:06.895
-Uh, actually--
-The more, the merrier.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.355
♪ Oh, what they think about you ♪

03:09.439 --> 03:10.398
♪ Prepare to leave my body... ♪

03:10.481 --> 03:13.610
[woman]  And you know your cousin Gina
moved in with her kids.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.528
Got another one on the way, too.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.988
-Can you believe that?
-[Coco] Mm-hmm.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.364
I can use the company, though.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.366
It's not like you ever call.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.619
She did get that assistant
manager job at Target,

03:22.702 --> 03:24.829
so praise God for that.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.248
You want me to see if she can
use her employee discount

03:27.332 --> 03:29.125
to get you a tankini or something?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.126
No, thanks.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.963
You sound busy, as usual.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.424
Just a lot on my mind.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.927
Do you remember that group
I was telling you about, CORE?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.261
-I think I'm--
- Child, you got

03:40.345 --> 03:42.263
so many of them clubs at that damn school,

03:42.347 --> 03:43.973
I can't keep 'em straight.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.642
Jordan, Terrell, unh-unh!
Where'd you get that?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.852
-Ugh.
- Give it here!

03:47.936 --> 03:49.020
I'm sorry.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.105
Her badass kids keep getting in my knives.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.815
I should just let them learn the hard way.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.359
-[Muffy] Hello.
-[Coco] All right, Mother.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.861
-Kisses.
-[scoffs]  What the hell?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.571
Hey, Muff, what's going on?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.073
[Muffy] Okay, so my whites at A-P

04:00.156 --> 04:01.908
have a few requests for you.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.910
-Mm-hmm.
-Danielle wants to know

04:03.993 --> 04:06.371
why her roommate claims
a cultural exemption

04:06.454 --> 04:08.706
for keeping their room at 80 degrees.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.166
Brooke wants to know,
since her hair's curly,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.001
can she use the word "nappy"?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.170
And Alex wants to know,

04:14.254 --> 04:17.173
what's the deal with black people
and the word "ask"?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.175
Don't they have Google?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.386
When did I become the white whisperer?

04:21.469 --> 04:24.222
Since you very consciously seized
on the opportunity

04:24.305 --> 04:26.641
to maintain a cult following
of white girls.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.352
Oh, right. Story of my life.
How could I forget?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.980
Hey, somebody's gotta
keep the peace around here.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.773
If not Saint Coco, then who?

04:33.856 --> 04:36.901
But if you benefit from racism,
you are a racist.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.737
[woman on TV]  The platform is
to talk about serious stuff,

04:39.821 --> 04:43.241
but my segment producers
don't really want that.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.784
Ah, I see what you're doing here.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.160
-Yeah.
-I see it. That's great.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.955
It's a great tactic to,
you know, pass the buck,

04:49.038 --> 04:51.165
and it's definitely worked for people
throughout all of history.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.500
Can you believe this is the guy

04:52.583 --> 04:54.460
Sam wants to bring to Winchester?

04:54.544 --> 04:55.753
Carson Rhodes?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.964
I mean, he is woke as fuck.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.425
I follow you on Twitter, and you
speak of the ills of the world.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.427
You could do the same thing on your show.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.929
But isn't this campus polarized enough?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.389
I mean, BSU can do what it wants,

05:06.472 --> 05:08.308
but somebody's gotta keep the peace.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.227
Since Troy is unreliable
and James is unremarkable,

05:11.311 --> 05:12.562
that leaves me.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.023
Hopefully, it'll pay off.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.524
-It will.
-[sighs]

05:16.607 --> 05:19.152
Pegasus has eyes everywhere.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.446
Come on. Either we get in or we don't.

05:21.529 --> 05:24.449
-It's no big deal, right?
-Are you kidding?

05:24.532 --> 05:27.744
We could be the first women admitted
to Pegasus.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.288
You can't buy that kind of notoriety.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.706
Well, you could.

05:31.789 --> 05:35.001
If I get in, I'll be a senator
by the time I'm 30.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.754
Otherwise, my best hope is
the House of Representatives,

05:37.837 --> 05:39.422
and I don't do well with underachievers.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.339
[chuckles]

05:40.423 --> 05:42.884
As a white person, what can I do?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.636
Do I watch more BET?

05:45.720 --> 05:48.014
'Cause I am down. I love that show.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.307
[scattered cheers]

05:50.433 --> 05:53.144
[Kelsey] Okay, so I know you're more
of a traditionalist,

05:53.227 --> 05:54.896
and I'm more of a modernist,

05:54.979 --> 05:56.564
but I really thought
that a transitional look

05:56.647 --> 05:58.524
would make this feel like home
for both of us.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.068
Are you open?

06:01.819 --> 06:03.988
I think it's chic and elegant,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.908
and frankly, it's the only thing
keeping my mind off of Sorbet

06:06.991 --> 06:08.534
and that racist dognapper.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.660
You know what?

06:09.744 --> 06:12.455
I bet that whoever stole Sorbet
set the fire at Davis.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.166
Classic Reichstag situation,
don't you think?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.251
-Good night.
-Good night? [scoffs]

06:17.335 --> 06:19.587
Why aren't you antagonizing
my aesthetic choices?

06:19.670 --> 06:22.215
What's wrong with you? Are you consta'?

06:22.298 --> 06:24.842
Did you get a B-plus
on your structural leadership exam?

06:24.926 --> 06:28.221
Did you have a weird sex dream
about Steve Harvey?

06:28.304 --> 06:30.848
Oh, are you sensitive
to planetary alignment?

06:30.932 --> 06:33.267
Pregnant? Did the dean
cancel your weekly meeting?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.728
Oh, I can't believe the dean's hubris.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.105
Wait.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.023
You are pregnant.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.567
-Don't be ridiculous.
-You hate red licorice.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.361
You said it tastes like plastic bananas.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.578
Why are you looking at the trash can?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.289
I'm not looking at the trash can.
Who's looking at the trash can?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.422
-[Coco exhales]
-Wow.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.049
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

07:05.133 --> 07:07.426
Those things are only 99.9% accurate.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.137
Coco! How did this happen?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.639
Sex. Sex is how this happened.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.850
But you seem so uptight and regimented

07:13.933 --> 07:15.226
and nakedly ambitious.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.687
I expect that you would use
two condoms and a NuvaRing.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.689
I know I present like a sexy robot,

07:19.772 --> 07:21.607
but I have flaws, okay?

07:21.691 --> 07:24.569
I fell for a guy
who's hot and well-connected

07:24.652 --> 07:27.363
and eats the booty
like high-end groceries.

07:27.989 --> 07:28.906
High-end?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.409
He savors every bite.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.660
Hole Foods.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.370
I got caught up.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.122
You use a condom every time you have sex?

07:36.205 --> 07:37.457
Never.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.668
[laughs] Oh, I got it.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.421
You took the W off,
like "Booty-Hole Foods."

07:43.504 --> 07:44.338
[laughs]

07:44.422 --> 07:47.049
You really should use condoms.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.301
I'm a lesbian, love.

07:48.968 --> 07:49.927
Gold star.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.721
Kelsey, are you coming out to me?

07:51.804 --> 07:52.638
Oh, God, no.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.308
I've been out ever since Queen Janet's
wardrobe malfunction.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.934
You're just so self-absorbed

07:57.018 --> 07:58.728
that the only time you listen
to anyone else talk

07:58.811 --> 07:59.687
is when you're preparing
a counterargument.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.606
That's not true. First of all--

08:01.689 --> 08:02.982
It's not totally your fault.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.401
Narcissism has a genetic component.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.069
But we can break the cycle.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.863
Mounting research shows that in the battle

08:08.946 --> 08:10.156
between nature and nurture--

08:10.239 --> 08:13.117
Stop it! I don't have the bandwidth
for any of this.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.412
Between CORE and exams
and getting into Pegasus,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.789
humiliating James
and playing white whisperer,

08:18.873 --> 08:21.083
-I just--
-Honey, if you don't deal with it,

08:21.167 --> 08:22.585
it's going to deal with you.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.884
Have you talked to anyone about this?

08:29.967 --> 08:30.801
Your mom?

08:34.430 --> 08:36.349
Are you gonna tell Troy?

08:38.392 --> 08:40.436
-[knock on door]
-[rap music playing on stereo]

08:40.520 --> 08:41.479
[Troy] Come in.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.817
[bong water bubbling]

08:49.237 --> 08:51.405
What is all of this?

08:51.989 --> 08:53.199
Like you care.

08:53.282 --> 08:55.660
My reputation's on the line.
I spent weeks dating you.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.953
Reps are overrated.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.412
[sighs]

08:58.871 --> 09:02.083
See, I left mine in that broken window
of Hancock Hall...

09:04.210 --> 09:05.628
...and I feel fantastic.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.839
You feel like feeling fantastic with me?

09:10.550 --> 09:15.304
Troy, I've been debating whether
or not to tell you something,

09:15.930 --> 09:18.891
and the more I think about it,
the more I know I have to.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.434
Um...

09:31.696 --> 09:34.365
Troy, I need you
to officially resign from CORE.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.784
What?

in your absence,

09:39.870 --> 09:42.206

-Okay.
-Okay.

That's what you came here for?

09:46.752 --> 09:47.587
Yes.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.021
[James] Yes! Ugh!

10:05.104 --> 10:07.815
Yes, that is sad.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.653
Accordingly, we will need
someone smart, responsible,

10:12.737 --> 10:15.656
and not annoying to fill his shoes.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.284
Obviously, that person should be me.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.784
It can be a relief to not be so focused
on yourself.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.952
You know?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.539
To actually care for something
or someone else.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.041
[Coco sighs]

20:14.922 --> 20:18.342
At least we're not
having this discussion in Texas.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.010
-Or Kentucky.
-Or Missouri.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.803
-Or Virginia.
-Or Utah.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.555
-Or South Dakota.
-[laughs]

20:23.639 --> 20:26.350
I really am needed on Capitol Hill.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.060
Desperately.

20:30.562 --> 20:34.274
Having a choice doesn't make
that choice any easier to make.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.445
As much as I'm not the girl
who just ups and has a baby,

20:38.528 --> 20:40.656
I'm also not the girl who just...

20:43.492 --> 20:45.577
[sniffles, sighs]

20:47.788 --> 20:50.791
Well, no matter what you decide...

20:53.085 --> 20:56.296
I'm the girl who'll be there for you...

20:57.506 --> 20:59.424
every step of the way,

21:00.259 --> 21:01.593
no matter what.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.316
Is this new?

21:16.400 --> 21:18.944
No. I just washed it.

21:19.695 --> 21:20.737
Oh.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.141
Kelsey...

21:51.393 --> 21:53.353
fuck this. I want to leave.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.063
Okay.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.655
Are you sure?

22:04.656 --> 22:05.991
Yes, please.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.250
Fuck.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.212
All right. It's okay.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.757
My dad's gonna freak out, but...

22:21.840 --> 22:22.924
Fuck!

22:23.008 --> 22:24.092
[Coco] Troy...

22:25.635 --> 22:27.804
I mean, it's, um--

22:27.888 --> 22:29.306
What if he cuts me off?

22:29.389 --> 22:31.475
All right? But he wouldn't.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.602
He loves you, and he likes me.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.314
-Troy...
-It's gonna be okay, Coco.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.024
Okay, we can get through this.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.610
I mean, maybe we get
an apartment off campus,

22:41.693 --> 22:43.195
-or we could--
-Troy!

22:44.321 --> 22:47.282
You're not in a place
where you can help me right now,

22:47.366 --> 22:48.784
but you need to be.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.162
So get your shit together.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.511
[Sam] Damn.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.347
You weren't even gonna say goodbye?

23:18.688 --> 23:19.773
[Coco sighs]

23:21.525 --> 23:22.901
Do you really have to leave?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.738
I can't do this here.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.830
[Coco sniffles]

23:42.295 --> 23:43.422
I'm gonna miss you.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.173
-Yeah, you will.
-[both laugh]

23:54.474 --> 23:55.642
[Coco] Thanks.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.564
Mom, it's here!

24:42.647 --> 24:44.441
[Coco squeals] Well, open it.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.067
-Okay, okay.
-Open it.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.363
"We regret to inform you

24:50.447 --> 24:52.199
we've reached our quota"...

24:52.282 --> 24:53.700
for sexy, bad bitches.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.286
Penelope Connors-Fairbanks!

24:56.369 --> 24:58.121
[both squeal]

24:58.205 --> 25:00.248
We knew I was getting in. I'm legacy.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.875
You didn't get in because of that.

25:01.958 --> 25:05.420
You got a 4.7, perfect SAT scores,

25:05.503 --> 25:07.130
you ski, you volunteer,

25:07.214 --> 25:09.174
and you're an intersectional feminist

25:09.257 --> 25:12.385
who seamlessly uses the word
"Lilliputian" in conversation.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.137
You deserve to be there.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.015
If this is your way of getting me
to say something nice about you...

25:17.098 --> 25:18.516
I'm just saying.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.769
You didn't just get into Winchester.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.438
You got into every college you applied to.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.398
But you're going to Winchester.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.651
[both scream and laugh]

25:27.734 --> 25:30.362
[Troy] Wow. Just like we left it, huh?

25:30.695 --> 25:33.657
This place used to mean the world to me.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.118
How's Natalie?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.828
-Natasha.
-[Coco chuckles]

25:38.912 --> 25:40.247
She's great.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.748
We're having a boy.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.000
Lord, just what we need.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.474
[sighs]

26:03.353 --> 26:04.521
[Coco] Penelope.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.777
You forgot your toiletry bag.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.195
I can just run to the store.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.572
-Just beam it to me.
-[sighs]

26:14.656 --> 26:18.576
Oh, right, I forgot that's a--
that's a thing you can do now.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.662
You just wanted to hug me again.

26:21.496 --> 26:22.789
So what if I did?

26:23.623 --> 26:25.125
You don't have to worry about me.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.751
Of course I do.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.005
I'll worry about you until the day I die.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.799
The experiences you'll have,

26:32.882 --> 26:34.634
the opportunities.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.970
And it won't always be easy.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.222
You'll make mistakes.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.850
You'll have a lot
of tough choices to make,

26:41.933 --> 26:43.893
but don't let that stop you from striving.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.186
[Troy] Coco.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.897
And no matter what happens, remember this:

26:47.981 --> 26:51.484
you have a right to be here
just like everybody else.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.194
You make your mark at Winchester,

26:53.278 --> 26:54.946
and the world will be at your feet.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.823
-Okay, Mom.
-The Senate...

26:56.906 --> 26:59.117
-Love you.
-the White House.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.411
[sighs] The sky is too limiting

27:01.494 --> 27:04.664
for what you're about to do,
my sweet, sweet girl.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.043
[Troy] Coco Connors.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.420
[woman] Is Coco Connors here?

27:17.510 --> 27:19.429
What do you wanna do?

27:21.765 --> 27:22.682
