01:47.807 --> 01:49.349
Thanks.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.810
You're welcome.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.062
Jones and Taylor just got it.

01:54.063 --> 01:55.564
How many guys we got Ieft?

01:55.565 --> 01:58.151
Just you and me.

01:58.818 --> 02:03.613
I think the best route is due west,
about 100 yards.

02:03.614 --> 02:06.241
MacGyver, I wanna tell you how much
I appreciate your being here.

02:06.242 --> 02:10.792
Save it. Till we get that
Iittle silver box back.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.542
Here. Just for insurance.

02:14.709 --> 02:16.710
Pete, you know how I feel
about those things.

02:16.711 --> 02:20.046
Yeah, I do, but you're
defenceless out here.

02:20.047 --> 02:23.176
No, just weaponless.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.842
Come on.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.819
There it is. The silver box is hidden
right under that bridge.

02:42.820 --> 02:45.490
Looks Iike we've got company.

02:49.744 --> 02:53.154
Maybe I can use that rifle after all.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.206
You're gonna use a rifle?

02:57.209 --> 02:59.709
Absolutely.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.174
- What are you doing?
- Gonna try and get his attention.

03:05.175 --> 03:08.553
MacGyver, the Iast thing we need
is to bring him over here.

03:08.554 --> 03:12.348
No, that's exactly what we do need.
We just won't be here to greet him.

03:12.349 --> 03:16.259
Why don't you keep watch
while I do this.

04:20.416 --> 04:22.960
I haven't seen anybody else.

04:22.961 --> 04:25.129
What's that? A time-delay fuse?

04:25.130 --> 04:28.215
Yeah, should draw his attention
over here.

04:28.216 --> 04:29.883
While we go to the bridge.

04:29.884 --> 04:32.384
- Right.
- Good idea.

04:32.470 --> 04:34.970
Let's go.

05:24.564 --> 05:27.149
Diversion worked. We're home free.

05:27.150 --> 05:28.942
No, the timer worked.

05:28.943 --> 05:31.443
We're not done yet.

05:36.701 --> 05:39.412
Go ahead. I'II keep watch.

05:42.623 --> 05:47.093
I guess you're right, Pete,
this is pretty easy.

05:55.469 --> 05:57.969
I'm hit.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.889
Pete?

06:35.134 --> 06:37.845
There goes the trophy again.

06:47.145 --> 06:50.025
Hey, Jeff, I wanna talk to you.

06:50.190 --> 06:52.690
Be back in a second.

06:56.405 --> 06:58.197
Congratulations.

06:58.198 --> 06:59.949
And it was nice to meet you, Kelly.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.660
Thanks. You weren't so bad
out there yourself.

07:02.661 --> 07:04.912
Oh, boy, I really gotta hand it to you.

07:04.913 --> 07:07.206
Not only do you not come
to the competition this year,

07:07.207 --> 07:09.917
but you end up winning.
And with a ringer.

07:09.918 --> 07:12.044
- You mean Kelly.
- Yes, I mean Kelly.

07:12.045 --> 07:14.839
- Where'd you get her anyway?
- She's Joe Henderson's kid.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.299
Henderson?
You mean the Joe Henderson?

07:17.300 --> 07:19.134
The Bushmaster champ?

07:19.135 --> 07:21.345
Joe's the reason
I couldn't show up today.

07:21.346 --> 07:23.430
What's the matter,
some kind of trouble?

07:23.431 --> 07:26.475
Joe was on a cargo flight for us
to Panama City.

07:26.476 --> 07:28.227
His plane went down
over San Perez.

07:28.228 --> 07:29.687
Oh, no.

07:29.688 --> 07:32.231
- Is he dead?
- No, he's okay.

07:32.232 --> 07:35.609
They're calling him a spy, Pete.
They're holding him for questioning.

07:35.610 --> 07:37.152
Joe Henderson a spy?

07:37.153 --> 07:39.321
- That is ridiculous.
- That's what I've been telling

07:39.322 --> 07:40.823
- the State Department.
- And?

07:40.824 --> 07:44.785
And bureaucrats got their own way
of dealing with things. SIow.

07:44.786 --> 07:46.995
It's just I can't hold off
telling Kelly any Ionger.

07:46.996 --> 07:48.455
Mr. Moore.

07:48.456 --> 07:51.125
Didn't I tell you we'd get it?
Didn't I tell you, Mr. Moore?

07:51.126 --> 07:52.960
You sure did, Kelly. It's just great.

07:52.961 --> 07:55.170
My dad is gonna flip
when he sees this.

07:55.171 --> 07:56.672
Yeah, you bet he is.

07:56.673 --> 08:01.426
Look, there's something I need
to talk to you about, Kelly.

08:01.427 --> 08:04.096
You should hear her talk
about that trophy.

08:04.097 --> 08:05.347
Yeah.

08:05.348 --> 08:10.828
Well, she's got something
more important to think about now.

08:12.063 --> 08:13.730
Have you exhausted
diplomatic channels?

08:13.731 --> 08:15.691
I've pulled every chain
in the State Department.

08:15.692 --> 08:18.235
The country down there
just won't budge.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.071
Joe's being used as a scapegoat.

08:21.072 --> 08:23.198
They're planning a trial in two days.

08:23.199 --> 08:24.950
Followed by an execution.

08:24.951 --> 08:27.787
Oh, nice. Really nice.

08:28.162 --> 08:30.962
I want my man back home, Pete.

08:31.332 --> 08:33.332
I didn't build this company
by sitting on a sofa

08:33.333 --> 08:35.669
waiting for bureaucrats
to push paper.

08:35.669 --> 08:40.909
I need your help in putting
together a crack rescue team.

08:41.217 --> 08:43.717
Come here.

08:44.512 --> 08:48.082
There it is.
There's your rescue team.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.980
Kelly.

09:00.653 --> 09:04.405
Honey, you shouldn't be working here
now. Why don't you go on home.

09:04.406 --> 09:06.491
I mean, haven't you found out
anything yet?

09:06.492 --> 09:08.159
Are they gonna Iet my dad go?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.411
Well, the State Department's
still making inquiries,

09:10.412 --> 09:13.039
but I think we're getting
real close to a solution.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.416
I thought you cared
about your employees.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.085
About my dad.

09:17.086 --> 09:19.128
Be patient.

09:19.129 --> 09:20.713
I'm working on it.

09:20.714 --> 09:23.214
Now go on home, huh?

09:37.940 --> 09:39.398
Well, here's the aerial map

09:39.399 --> 09:42.693
and the reconnaissance
information for San Perez.

09:42.694 --> 09:44.278
You know, I can see
MacGyver's way in,

09:44.279 --> 09:46.239
but how's he gonna get out
when the job's done?

09:46.240 --> 09:50.243
Well, the chopper'II pick you up here,
section H, 0800 hours, day two.

09:50.244 --> 09:51.953
Who's my contact on the inside?

09:51.954 --> 09:53.788
Lieutenant Raul Parra.

09:53.789 --> 09:56.540
He's gonna be acting as
public defender for Henderson's trial.

09:56.541 --> 09:58.960
He's gonna meet you at a Iittle church
at the edge of town

09:58.961 --> 10:01.087
tomorrow at 2100 hours.

10:01.088 --> 10:03.297
How well does the pilot
know the area?

10:03.298 --> 10:07.208
Don't worry about him.
He's our best man.

10:11.515 --> 10:14.059
- One question.
- Shoot.

10:14.226 --> 10:17.728
You've got a dozen pilots
on your payroll. Why you?

10:17.729 --> 10:20.606
Never could keep my spoon
out of the broth.

10:20.607 --> 10:22.858
Three minutes to San Perez,
section C.

10:22.859 --> 10:25.277
AImost time for the green Iight.
Better get ready.

10:25.278 --> 10:26.654
I'II see you soon.

10:26.655 --> 10:30.545
Not soon enough, partner.
Go get him, huh?

10:33.119 --> 10:35.329
Any time you're ready.

10:35.330 --> 10:40.200
- What are you doing here?
- Relax. I'm just Ieaving.

11:01.022 --> 11:03.565
What kind of stunt do you think
you were playing up there?

11:03.566 --> 11:05.400
You realize you could have
killed yourself?

11:05.401 --> 11:07.986
Relax. I know what I'm doing.
I've been trained in this.

11:07.987 --> 11:10.530
The first thing to do is chart
our distance to the border of--

11:10.531 --> 11:13.367
No, the first thing we're gonna do
is get an explanation from you.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.827
Okay, here it is: I'm saving my dad.

11:15.828 --> 11:17.329
I've got it all planned out.

11:17.330 --> 11:20.582
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
the rest of us had a plan too?

11:20.583 --> 11:22.626
And that your coming along
messes everything up?

11:22.627 --> 11:24.252
Me mess things up?

11:24.253 --> 11:26.213
I overheard you guys talking.

11:26.214 --> 11:27.798
You don't even have a gun.

11:27.799 --> 11:32.219
I've got tear gas, combat knife,
9 mm automatic and ten clips.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.764
Kelly, this isn't a game.

11:34.931 --> 11:37.849
People down here don't come back
to Iife when you blow a whistle.

11:37.850 --> 11:39.226
I know that.

11:39.227 --> 11:41.727
I just want my dad back.

11:42.438 --> 11:44.564
That's what we all want.

11:44.565 --> 11:46.983
But you being here
doesn't make it any easier.

11:46.984 --> 11:48.318
I can take care of myself.

11:48.319 --> 11:50.819
That's what worries me.

11:52.239 --> 11:54.407
Guess I don't have a choice,
though, do I?

11:54.408 --> 11:57.608
Nope. Come on, you're wasting time.

11:58.871 --> 12:01.164
Kelly.

12:01.165 --> 12:03.675
You're going the wrong way.

12:56.303 --> 12:58.846
Colonel, I'm Lieutenant Raul Parra.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.389
Welcome, Iieutenant.

13:00.390 --> 13:03.059
I understand you have been appointed
by the central government

13:03.060 --> 13:05.102
to represent the American in court.

13:05.103 --> 13:07.883
- That's correct, sir.
- Good.

13:14.321 --> 13:17.865
I've been told there's no real proof
of his guilt.

13:17.866 --> 13:20.242
The problem is being corrected
as we speak.

13:20.243 --> 13:24.933
CIassified documents
have been planted in his plane.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.210
PIease have a seat, Mr. Henderson.

13:29.211 --> 13:33.756
I'd Iike you to meet the public defender
who's been assigned to represent you.

13:33.757 --> 13:36.926
Let's not play any games.
No one's gonna defend me.

13:36.927 --> 13:39.261
I know I'm innocent.
You know I'm innocent.

13:39.262 --> 13:41.889
So get on with whatever it is
you're fishing for.

13:41.890 --> 13:45.434
Well, I do have a proposition
you might consider.

13:45.435 --> 13:48.535
- Thought you might.
- PIease sit.

13:54.361 --> 13:56.445
Since the coup two months ago,

13:56.446 --> 13:59.323
we've all been under the scrutiny
of our new government.

13:59.324 --> 14:02.534
They want you tried and found guilty
by tomorrow.

14:02.535 --> 14:04.411
And the crimes for which
you have been charged

14:04.412 --> 14:07.352
carry a mandatory death sentence.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.209
There is an alternative.

14:10.210 --> 14:11.919
What kind of alternative?

14:11.920 --> 14:15.714
If you were to give us a videotaped
confession before the trial,

14:15.715 --> 14:17.758
our government will
reduce your sentence

14:17.759 --> 14:20.052
to no more than
twenty years in prison.

14:20.053 --> 14:21.553
But I didn't do anything.

14:21.554 --> 14:25.334
That is not the issue any Ionger,
is it?

14:26.017 --> 14:29.777
You have till tomorrow morning
to decide.

14:52.293 --> 14:54.794
You know, this is a Iot easier
than I expected.

14:54.795 --> 14:56.796
I thought we'd be dodging bullets
in the jungle.

14:56.797 --> 15:01.176
And instead we're taking
a nice Iittle cruise into town.

15:01.177 --> 15:03.927
I think the cruise just ended.

15:04.764 --> 15:07.849
I hope I'm wrong, but it Iooks Iike
the police are gonna check the bus.

15:07.850 --> 15:10.518
Sometimes they grab people
who don't have the right papers.

15:10.519 --> 15:12.771
And sometimes they shoot them.

15:12.772 --> 15:14.939
Get your passport ready.

15:14.940 --> 15:17.776
- I don't have a passport.
- You what?

15:17.777 --> 15:20.277
I don't have a passport.

15:23.115 --> 15:24.908
Quick. Sneak out the back door.

15:24.909 --> 15:28.589
Hide until they're done
checking people.

16:36.021 --> 16:37.396
I Iike American.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.772
Nice hat.

16:38.773 --> 16:41.273
Let me see your passport.

16:42.944 --> 16:45.029
What is your business
here in San Perez?

16:45.030 --> 16:46.238
Tourist.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.867
We have no tourism
to speak of in San Perez.

16:49.868 --> 16:52.698
What are you really doing here?

17:03.298 --> 17:05.339
Run, Kelly, get out and run!

17:05.340 --> 17:07.718
Hold it, hold it.

17:07.719 --> 17:10.219
It's a misunderstanding.

17:10.722 --> 17:13.222
Big misunderstanding.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.709
Now, why were you hiding from us?

17:40.710 --> 17:42.419
She Iost her passport.

17:42.420 --> 17:46.256
She was scared.
That's why she was hiding.

17:46.257 --> 17:48.757
Let me see.

17:49.177 --> 17:51.677
Tear gas.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.349
Miniflares.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.435
Ammunition.

17:58.436 --> 18:01.147
Everything a tourist needs.

18:02.398 --> 18:05.400
It seems you have good reason
to be scared.

18:05.401 --> 18:09.154
Americans get no special treatment
under the new regime.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.448
Including revolutionaries.

18:11.449 --> 18:13.199
We're not revolutionaries.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.700
I mean, we're...

18:16.912 --> 18:19.412
PIease go on.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.167
I said go on.

18:22.168 --> 18:24.502
- Habla.
- Come on. We don't need--

18:24.503 --> 18:27.088
Sir, the weapons are mine.
Leave him alone.

18:27.089 --> 18:30.967
Very noble, but you should be
concerned about your own fate.

18:30.968 --> 18:33.468
Down on your knees.

18:34.513 --> 18:37.013
Now.

19:12.467 --> 19:15.386
You're Iucky that soldier
didn't shoot you back there.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.929
I figured, what would Dad do?

19:16.930 --> 19:18.639
He's quite a guy, huh?

19:18.640 --> 19:21.517
I'II never be that great, for sure.

19:21.518 --> 19:24.018
Do you have to be?

19:26.940 --> 19:28.649
This place gives me the creeps.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.151
Where is everybody?

19:30.152 --> 19:31.861
The military must have
moved them out,

19:31.862 --> 19:35.114
centralized the people
to control them.

19:35.115 --> 19:36.991
Where's my dad?

19:36.992 --> 19:39.492
Up there.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.796
What are we waiting for?

19:50.797 --> 19:52.548
We have to hide until dark.

19:52.549 --> 19:54.717
- Why?
- My contact.

19:54.718 --> 19:58.762
I'm gonna meet him at the church
on the edge of town at 2100 hours.

19:58.763 --> 20:01.263
Until then we stay put.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.772
Hungry?

20:12.444 --> 20:16.464
I guess I Ieft my rations
with my passport.

20:17.907 --> 20:20.407
No problem.

20:22.412 --> 20:26.352
So you and your dad
are pretty tight, huh?

20:26.374 --> 20:27.874
He's my mom and my dad.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.377
See, my mom died
right after I was born.

20:30.378 --> 20:32.462
Any brothers or sisters?

20:32.463 --> 20:35.966
No. I guess I'm his
daughter and his son.

20:35.967 --> 20:39.667
Which one of you
is here to rescue him?

20:40.555 --> 20:42.389
Two Americans smuggling weapons

20:42.390 --> 20:45.308
escaped past your checkpoint,
sergeant?

20:45.309 --> 20:47.477
Yes, sir. But our forces
are spread so thin--

20:47.478 --> 20:49.354
Are you making excuses?

20:49.355 --> 20:52.816
They will be caught.
And executed immediately, sir.

20:52.817 --> 20:54.985
Colonel, if I may suggest,

20:54.986 --> 20:57.946
you might want to put them
on trial first.

20:57.947 --> 21:00.991
They could be part of
a rescue operation.

21:00.992 --> 21:03.743
- What do you mean?
- Exposing a U.S. rescue attempt

21:03.744 --> 21:06.413
could further prove
Henderson is a spy.

21:06.414 --> 21:08.540
The central government
would be very pleased.

21:08.541 --> 21:11.261
Yes. That's a very good idea.

21:11.627 --> 21:13.753
Put every available man
on the search.

21:13.754 --> 21:16.464
Find them and bring them to me.

21:16.465 --> 21:17.882
And, sergeant...

21:17.883 --> 21:20.383
...get rid of that cap.

21:22.304 --> 21:24.804
Yes, sir.

21:55.671 --> 21:57.714
Where's that contact of yours?

21:57.715 --> 22:00.215
We're a Iittle early.

22:20.195 --> 22:22.695
MacGyver?

22:23.865 --> 22:26.200
You must be Lieutenant...

22:26.201 --> 22:28.701
Parra.

22:30.998 --> 22:32.873
How's my father?

22:32.874 --> 22:36.210
He's injured his Ieg,
but he's well otherwise.

22:36.211 --> 22:38.379
Is he gonna be able to make it
to the pickup point?

22:38.380 --> 22:39.880
He'II have to.

22:39.881 --> 22:44.718
AII the roads will be blocked now that
Colonel Salazar knows you are here.

22:44.719 --> 22:48.514
It was my understanding
you were coming alone.

22:48.515 --> 22:50.057
Mine too.

22:50.058 --> 22:52.726
Getting one of you inside
the compound will be risky enough.

22:52.727 --> 22:54.520
I'm afraid you can't come.

22:54.521 --> 22:56.522
Who are you to say
I can't rescue my own father?

22:56.523 --> 23:01.152
- Kelly.
- We had an orchestrated plan.

23:01.319 --> 23:03.779
She's about to get us all killed.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.073
Kelly, he's right.
You have to stay behind.

23:06.074 --> 23:10.674
No. You're not gonna ditch me here
Iike some kid.

23:13.540 --> 23:17.480
Give me a minute alone with her,
will you?

23:24.801 --> 23:27.177
Kelly...

23:27.178 --> 23:30.264
...you can't come. That's the end of it.

23:30.265 --> 23:32.683
I just want my dad back.

23:32.684 --> 23:34.810
I know how much
you wanna rescue him,

23:34.811 --> 23:37.229
and believe me, I don't wanna
Ieave you here alone.

23:37.230 --> 23:39.690
But this is the only way to do it.

23:39.691 --> 23:42.471
You don't understand, MacGyver.

23:42.694 --> 23:45.654
I want to show him
that I can be just Iike...

23:45.655 --> 23:47.864
Just Iike...

23:47.865 --> 23:50.365
A son?

23:51.452 --> 23:53.078
Did he say that to you?

23:53.079 --> 23:55.122
That he wanted a son?

23:55.123 --> 23:57.040
He didn't have to.

23:57.041 --> 24:00.794
That's an awful Iot to assume,
isn't it?

24:00.795 --> 24:05.423
Maybe I am trying to prove something,
but I want him to be safe.

24:05.424 --> 24:07.924
That's first.

24:10.888 --> 24:13.388
Okay, I'II stay behind.

24:15.101 --> 24:17.601
Thanks.

24:19.438 --> 24:21.938
We'II get him back.

24:30.658 --> 24:33.158
Lieutenant.

24:41.919 --> 24:46.399
- So is everything still on schedule?
- Perfectly.

24:47.424 --> 24:50.052
Raise your hands.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.180
Move.

25:19.998 --> 25:24.338
- Chocolate.
- You can keep that if you'd Iike.

25:27.005 --> 25:28.839
Listen, I hope you didn't
take what happened

25:28.840 --> 25:31.780
back at the roadblock personally.

25:33.929 --> 25:36.429
I guess you did.

25:42.729 --> 25:45.229
Get away from that. Go on.

25:45.398 --> 25:47.898
Get out of here.

25:53.573 --> 25:55.407
Hey, there's no more room in here.

25:55.408 --> 25:57.908
Two's enough.

25:57.994 --> 26:01.854
And that one's trying
to steal my dinner.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.251
Well, believe me, I don't wanna
be here any Ionger than I have to.

26:05.252 --> 26:07.752
Who are you?

26:08.546 --> 26:09.964
The name's MacGyver.

26:09.965 --> 26:12.007
I'm here to help you escape.

26:12.008 --> 26:14.760
- Sure you are.
- No, it's true.

26:14.761 --> 26:17.096
Your boss, Jeff Moore,
dropped me off.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.681
He's got a chopper waiting
as soon as my inside contact

26:19.682 --> 26:21.433
gets things rolling for us.

26:21.434 --> 26:23.143
Mr. Moore organized this?

26:23.144 --> 26:26.188
He sent one man
to get me past an army?

26:26.189 --> 26:28.023
Yeah.

26:28.024 --> 26:31.860
Unfortunately, we have
a Iittle unsolicited help.

26:31.861 --> 26:34.696
Your daughter's waiting
on the outside too.

26:34.697 --> 26:36.615
Outside? Where?

26:36.616 --> 26:38.617
Just take it easy, will you?

26:38.618 --> 26:40.702
She's all right as Iong
as she stays put.

26:40.703 --> 26:41.995
She's at the church.

26:41.996 --> 26:44.456
That's crazy.

26:44.457 --> 26:46.875
Kelly here in San Perez? Why?

26:46.876 --> 26:48.251
I don't know.

26:48.252 --> 26:52.142
That might be something
you wanna ask her.

27:03.935 --> 27:06.311
So when the Americans
contacted you,

27:06.312 --> 27:09.481
you played along as if you were
to help with their escape plan?

27:09.482 --> 27:12.359
That's correct, sir.
The central government ordered me

27:12.360 --> 27:15.320
to remain secret about it
as a security measure.

27:15.321 --> 27:16.696
What happened to the girl?

27:16.697 --> 27:18.740
I never saw her. He was alone.

27:18.741 --> 27:20.116
Then she's still out there.

27:20.117 --> 27:22.452
Yes. But...

27:22.453 --> 27:24.996
...their rescue attempt failed.

27:24.997 --> 27:28.166
Henderson must be
very demoralized by this.

27:28.167 --> 27:30.168
Easy to manipulate, perhaps.

27:30.169 --> 27:32.669
Yes.

27:33.923 --> 27:38.260
Now is the time
to obtain that confession.

27:38.427 --> 27:40.678
Excellent thinking, sir.

27:40.679 --> 27:42.722
Speak to your clients.

27:42.723 --> 27:45.433
I will clear the path into the cell.

27:45.434 --> 27:47.934
As you wish, sir.

27:49.605 --> 27:52.565
Find the girl before there's
another rescue attempt.

27:52.566 --> 27:55.151
We cannot spare any more men
to search, colonel.

27:55.152 --> 27:57.070
Do as I say.

27:57.071 --> 28:00.365
Compensate for the Iack of men
however you have to.

28:00.366 --> 28:02.866
I want more security.

28:37.069 --> 28:39.487
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're fine.

28:39.488 --> 28:40.905
Everything still on schedule?

28:40.906 --> 28:44.325
Yes, but Salazar is getting nervous.
We haven't much time.

28:44.326 --> 28:45.659
What's the plan?

28:45.660 --> 28:48.162
We only have one chance
to break you out.

28:48.163 --> 28:51.290
The guard outside will start
to walk on his rounds at dawn.

28:51.291 --> 28:52.750
As soon as he Ieaves,

28:52.751 --> 28:55.252
I'II drop a pouch of plastique
explosive through the window--

28:55.253 --> 28:56.962
Wait a minute.

28:56.963 --> 28:59.256
I don't know about plastique.

28:59.257 --> 29:05.107
The noise is Iiable to attract
more soldiers than we can handle.

29:08.099 --> 29:10.643
You got a kitchen in this complex?
A refrigerator?

29:10.644 --> 29:12.645
I have a small refrigerator
in my quarters.

29:12.646 --> 29:14.938
That's great. Look in the back
and find the compressor.

29:14.939 --> 29:17.608
Follow the coil down
to the canister of Freon gas--

29:17.609 --> 29:19.610
Wait, slow down.

29:19.611 --> 29:21.236
Follow the coil down to what?

29:21.237 --> 29:23.113
AII right, wait a minute.

29:23.114 --> 29:24.364
First, find the compressor.

29:24.365 --> 29:27.076
It's the motorized pump in the back
that makes all the noise.

29:27.077 --> 29:30.537
There's a coiled metal tube
attached to it.

29:30.538 --> 29:32.539
- I understand. Continue.
- AII right.

29:32.540 --> 29:36.418
Follow that coil down to a small
canister that contains Freon gas.

29:36.419 --> 29:39.671
Crimp both ends of that canister
so the gas doesn't Ieak out.

29:39.672 --> 29:41.215
Cut it off and bring it to me.

29:41.216 --> 29:44.301
What are you gonna
use the Freon for?

29:44.302 --> 29:45.844
Gonna break the Iock.

29:45.845 --> 29:48.345
Quietly.

30:18.002 --> 30:20.295
Excuse me.

30:20.296 --> 30:24.466
Hello. We could sure use
all the fresh air we can get in here.

30:24.467 --> 30:27.427
You are Iucky
to be breathing at all, señor.

30:27.428 --> 30:30.018
We take no more chances now.

30:31.223 --> 30:35.743
Now how are we gonna get
that Freon gas in here?

30:38.272 --> 30:40.772
I don't know.

30:57.124 --> 31:00.084
Hey, come on, MacGyver,
you're not gonna catch that rat.

31:00.085 --> 31:02.645
We've been at it for hours.

31:05.007 --> 31:07.507
Well, Iook at it this way.

31:08.052 --> 31:11.512
He's getting just as tired as we are.

31:17.019 --> 31:19.519
Gotcha.

31:40.751 --> 31:43.251
MacGyver.

31:43.545 --> 31:45.755
Can you knock a board out?

31:45.756 --> 31:49.759
No, it's too noisy.
Just Iike the plastique.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.177
Go around back.

31:51.178 --> 31:55.758
You'II get a Iittle visitor
through the drainpipe.

31:55.766 --> 31:58.266
Time for your big escape.

33:22.059 --> 33:25.061
Do you think there's enough Freon
to freeze the Iock?

33:25.062 --> 33:27.912
I'II tell you when it's empty.

33:42.913 --> 33:45.416
You do it?

33:45.583 --> 33:46.916
Yeah.

33:46.917 --> 33:49.753
It should shatter Iike a piece of glass.

33:49.754 --> 33:51.212
I hope.

33:51.213 --> 33:54.093
Do it. The guard's coming back.

33:56.010 --> 33:58.510
Come on.

34:57.779 --> 35:00.279
You okay?

35:00.365 --> 35:03.435
Yeah, getting better all the time.

35:24.931 --> 35:27.308
- Daddy.
- We're gonna be all right, honey.

35:27.309 --> 35:29.184
I thought I told you
to stay in the church.

35:29.185 --> 35:32.146
I couldn't. I came Iooking for you.
I was worried you wouldn't come back.

35:32.147 --> 35:35.267
AII right, all right. We gotta go.

36:07.432 --> 36:10.143
You all right? Okay, come on.

36:14.355 --> 36:16.855
Hold on.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.282
- Leg's gone, huh?
- Not much Ieft.

36:25.283 --> 36:27.325
Why don't we check
that map in Kelly's pack?

36:27.326 --> 36:29.826
Yeah.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.665
What time is that chopper
gonna meet us again?

36:33.666 --> 36:37.377
0800 hours on the other side
of the San Morro River gorge.

36:37.378 --> 36:41.006
I'II never make it there
on foot in time.

36:41.007 --> 36:45.027
Yeah, well, the road's
bound to be blocked.

36:45.219 --> 36:47.345
But that railway Iine won't be.

36:47.346 --> 36:49.846
But we don't have a train.

36:51.392 --> 36:53.892
I know where to get one.

36:56.105 --> 36:58.605
What do you say?

36:58.649 --> 37:00.567
The Americans have escaped!

37:00.568 --> 37:04.195
- How Iong ago?
- There is no way of telling.

37:04.196 --> 37:05.780
What have you done about this?

37:05.781 --> 37:07.907
I searched the compound,
but found nothing, sir.

37:07.908 --> 37:09.492
Then I came directly here.

37:09.493 --> 37:14.133
- While they continue to escape?
- Colonel, please--

37:45.445 --> 37:47.613
The gauge of a train track
in the United States

37:47.614 --> 37:50.283
matches the wheelbase
of my own jeep,

37:50.284 --> 37:52.784
give or take an inch.

37:53.203 --> 37:55.037
This jeep looked the same as mine

37:55.038 --> 37:58.928
and the tracks outside
were a close match.

37:59.459 --> 38:05.969
None of that mattered, of course,
if I couldn't get the engine running.

38:09.970 --> 38:15.420
Well, getting the engine going
didn't seem to be a problem.

38:19.312 --> 38:22.512
But keeping it going just might be.

38:23.733 --> 38:26.236
Radiator's bone-dry.

38:26.736 --> 38:32.846
And my guess was a few bullet
holes had something to do with that.

38:50.260 --> 38:54.040
Sometimes I just hate it
when I'm right.

38:57.475 --> 38:59.685
I had to find some way
to plug up this radiator

38:59.686 --> 39:03.306
if we were ever gonna
get out of here.

39:20.415 --> 39:23.792
There are times you can't
do a job all by yourself.

39:23.793 --> 39:26.962
What I needed was a little help
from the locals.

39:26.963 --> 39:29.507
Local chickens, that is.

39:36.681 --> 39:39.181
Stay.

40:08.587 --> 40:12.590
Were you ever sorry you had me
instead of a son?

40:12.591 --> 40:15.181
I never wanted a son, Kelly.

40:15.719 --> 40:18.259
Whatever gave you that idea?

40:18.555 --> 40:21.140
AII that sports stuff.
I mean, Bushmaster--

40:21.141 --> 40:22.934
I don't know.

40:22.935 --> 40:25.645
Well, you seemed to
enjoy it all so much that I--

40:25.646 --> 40:30.116
I enjoyed it because
I thought you wanted me to.

40:32.319 --> 40:35.571
Well, to tell you the truth,
I never knew how to raise a daughter.

40:35.572 --> 40:38.742
I was just doing the best I could.

40:40.285 --> 40:44.145
Kelly, I wouldn't want you
any other way.

40:47.084 --> 40:49.627
Egg whites are good
for a lot of things.

40:49.628 --> 40:52.463
Lemon meringue pie,
angel food cake,

40:52.464 --> 40:55.008
and plugging up radiators.

40:55.884 --> 40:57.301
The idea is

40:57.302 --> 40:59.512
the boiling water in the radiator
will cook the eggs

40:59.513 --> 41:02.431
and they'll temporarily
clog the holes.

41:02.432 --> 41:05.812
That is if the holes aren't too big.

41:20.158 --> 41:22.243
I guess MacGyver was right.

41:22.244 --> 41:26.372
I was trying to prove
something I didn't need to.

41:26.373 --> 41:29.413
Think we've both been doing that?

41:44.974 --> 41:47.184
Kelly, open the gate.

41:47.185 --> 41:49.685
Let's go, Joe.

41:51.022 --> 41:53.692
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

42:58.255 --> 43:00.507
We'II cross the bridge in a mile or so.

43:00.508 --> 43:02.300
Pickup point's just beyond that.

43:02.301 --> 43:03.676
How's the time?

43:03.677 --> 43:06.177
About five minutes.

43:24.698 --> 43:27.198
We're not through yet.

43:30.329 --> 43:31.954
What do we do?

43:31.955 --> 43:33.831
Joe, keep your foot
on the accelerator.

43:33.832 --> 43:36.452
Kelly, switch places with me.

43:43.884 --> 43:46.135
Now what are you doing?

43:46.136 --> 43:48.886
Trying to slow up our friends.

43:53.977 --> 43:59.717
I think we'II be using that
arsenal of yours after all, Kelly.

44:35.143 --> 44:37.643
There's the bridge.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.580
Either of you got a match?

44:57.624 --> 44:59.082
No.

44:59.083 --> 45:02.363
I need something to Iight this fuse.

45:05.215 --> 45:08.155
They're getting closer, MacGyver.

45:24.776 --> 45:27.276
Hurry. We're almost there.

45:28.071 --> 45:30.571
Got it.

46:09.070 --> 46:11.570
Okay.

46:16.619 --> 46:19.119
Look, the chopper.

46:21.415 --> 46:24.000
Well, it Iooks Iike your boss
is right on time.

46:24.001 --> 46:26.794
You did it, MacGyver, you did it.

46:26.795 --> 46:28.296
No...

46:28.297 --> 46:30.797
...we all did it.

46:38.766 --> 46:41.434
Are you sure Joe and Kelly are
gonna meet us here for dinner?

46:41.435 --> 46:43.144
Take it easy.
They'II get here any minute.

46:43.145 --> 46:44.854
I'II get you to that steak house
on time.

46:44.855 --> 46:48.149
Believe him, Pete. He wasn't
a minute Iate with that chopper.

46:48.150 --> 46:51.194
Just a Iittle pickup and delivery.
You know, business as usual.

46:51.195 --> 46:54.113
You know, I heard this morning
Colonel Salazar has fled the country.

46:54.114 --> 46:56.407
Looks Iike San Perez is gonna
have a new government soon.

46:56.408 --> 46:58.326
Yeah, we did a good job of it,
didn't we, guys?

46:58.327 --> 47:00.244
We weren't the only ones.

47:00.245 --> 47:02.745
Sorry we're Iate.

47:02.831 --> 47:05.331
Had to do a few things.

47:06.293 --> 47:08.878
Well, now, wait a minute. Hold on.

47:08.879 --> 47:11.255
Look at this beautiful young Iady.

47:11.256 --> 47:13.007
Actually, my dad bought it for me.

47:13.008 --> 47:16.260
Does this mean you're not gonna play
Bushmaster with us again next year?

47:16.261 --> 47:17.553
Well...

47:17.554 --> 47:21.284
- It's entirely up to Kelly.
- Oh, yeah?

47:21.349 --> 47:23.559
Including which team she plays for?

47:23.560 --> 47:26.060
Yes.
