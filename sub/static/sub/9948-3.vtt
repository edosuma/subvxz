06:48.900 --> 06:50.299

06:50.300 --> 06:53.259
Oh, very close, we were, at one time.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.699

06:54.700 --> 06:57.740
The lady who passed away
so tragically.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.260
So, when were you close?

07:02.261 --> 07:04.619
Back in the day, in the '60s.

07:04.620 --> 07:05.900
Too long ago to remember.

07:05.901 --> 07:10.020
No, please, do try. It's wonderful
meeting people who knew my mum.

07:11.980 --> 07:13.899
Your mum?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.179
Oh, well...

07:15.180 --> 07:18.259
Er, she loved travel, your mother.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.979
She did, especially in the '60s.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.739
We travelled together...

07:22.740 --> 07:24.379
all over,

07:24.380 --> 07:27.739
across Europe, North America...

07:27.740 --> 07:29.979
I hope you don't mind,

07:29.980 --> 07:33.339
but since we only brought my mother
back from Austria yesterday,

07:33.340 --> 07:34.939
would you mind saying a few words?

07:34.940 --> 07:39.739
No! That's something
you should do, surely.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.539
Well, she left when I was two. She
only got back in touch last year.

07:43.540 --> 07:46.060
Someone like you
could say so much more.

07:47.780 --> 07:49.100
Oh!

07:50.420 --> 07:51.740
Thanks.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.780

08:00.060 --> 08:02.659

08:02.660 --> 08:04.300
(LAUGHS) Why wouldn't I?

08:06.340 --> 08:07.820

08:08.740 --> 08:09.980

08:11.660 --> 08:14.380

08:17.420 --> 08:21.060
Jewish, of course,
which is still a religion.

08:25.540 --> 08:27.540
We were together at...

08:30.580 --> 08:32.739
the Prague Spring.

08:32.740 --> 08:38.620
Oh, yes, facing down
the might of the Soviet Empire.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.379

08:42.380 --> 08:44.058

09:10.100 --> 09:11.139

09:12.660 --> 09:14.100

Oh, right. Yeah, I'd love to.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.779

09:33.780 --> 09:34.620
Fire away.

09:34.621 --> 09:37.099
What's your favourite book?

09:37.100 --> 09:39.019
Batman.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.140
If there was an election tomorrow,
who would you vote for?

09:41.141 --> 09:43.580
Nobody. Politics is boring.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.739
World events, and stuff?

09:46.740 --> 09:49.019

09:49.020 --> 09:53.139

in town. I said we might go.

09:53.140 --> 09:56.379

have to do everything together.

09:56.380 --> 09:59.140
But you said that's the secret
to a happy relationship.

10:00.780 --> 10:02.419
Maybe I was wrong.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.380
Go out, have a great time.

10:26.380 --> 10:27.500
Sorry. Did I wake you?

10:27.501 --> 10:28.700
No.

10:29.940 --> 10:30.980
Couldn't sleep.

10:30.981 --> 10:32.699
Is everything all right?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.259
Just me mind working overtime.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.819
Did you get off with anyone?

10:36.820 --> 10:38.539
What?!

10:38.540 --> 10:40.539
No, course not.
Did you?

10:40.540 --> 10:41.379
No!

10:41.380 --> 10:42.300

10:42.301 --> 10:45.579

10:45.580 --> 10:47.859
I think it's about time you did.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.260
What?!

11:00.264 --> 11:03.903
I'll keep it safe until your dad
comes back for it, yeah?

11:03.904 --> 11:05.224

11:14.824 --> 11:15.903

Friend of a friend.

11:17.264 --> 11:19.823
She wants him to shag around,
tells him to go for it?

11:19.824 --> 11:20.623
Yeah.

11:20.624 --> 11:24.063
It's every man's dream, innit,
having a bird pushing him

11:24.064 --> 11:27.704
to spread his seed? Fuck,
tell him to fill his boots!

11:38.144 --> 11:41.343
Of course, it means she's
splitting up with him.

11:41.344 --> 11:43.703
No, she wants them to stay together.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.703
She's dumping him. If your mate
can't see that, he's a muppet.

11:46.704 --> 11:49.024
Either that or she's already
doing someone herself.

12:00.024 --> 12:01.744
And the woman said,
"Shall I get you a priest?"

12:01.745 --> 12:03.823
The little lad,
wiping away his tears says,

12:03.824 --> 12:06.904
"No! Sex is the last thing
on my mind!"

12:11.264 --> 12:14.943
I hope that's a fucking money tree.
We could do wi' one!

12:14.944 --> 12:20.464
It's a cherry. I thought we could
plant it together in memory of...

12:21.584 --> 12:24.823
We'd have somewhere
we could go to think of her.

12:24.824 --> 12:26.104
Oh, for fuck's sake.

12:32.104 --> 12:33.463
There's your pal's lad.

12:33.464 --> 12:35.463
Oh, crap.

12:35.464 --> 12:40.543
Hello, ladies, I hope you don't
mind. I tried a few places.

12:40.544 --> 12:42.903
Nice work, Sherlock.

12:42.904 --> 12:46.143
It's just... I've
so many questions about my mother.

12:46.144 --> 12:48.583
My memory's not what it was.

12:48.584 --> 12:49.504
Any scraps from the table.

12:49.505 --> 12:52.943
From what I can gather,
she did do Paul McCartney,

12:52.944 --> 12:55.344
but Bobby Charlton is just a rumour.

12:58.464 --> 13:00.544
A bottle of pale ale as well.
That's really good.

13:00.545 --> 13:04.023
And it's good for you, full of iron.

13:04.024 --> 13:05.263
I'm not sure.

13:05.264 --> 13:06.262
I didn't like it at first...

13:06.263 --> 13:07.502
Fuck's going on?!

13:07.503 --> 13:08.502
All right, Billy?

13:08.503 --> 13:10.104
Is it him? Are you doing him?
Is that what this is about?

13:10.105 --> 13:11.543
What are you on about?

13:11.544 --> 13:13.063
I'm not fucking having it!

13:13.064 --> 13:14.104
Calm yourself, fella.

13:14.105 --> 13:17.183
Aaah!
Fuck, I think I've broke me hand!

13:17.184 --> 13:18.703
Are you all right?

13:18.704 --> 13:19.984
Stop talking to him!

13:19.985 --> 13:23.583
Shut the fuck up, you,
you're an embarrassment.

13:23.584 --> 13:25.384
I'm so sorry about this.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.783
I'm only trying to do what's right,
you know.

13:40.784 --> 13:42.104
I can't pretend it never happened.

13:42.105 --> 13:44.384
And I won't live every
day like it just has.

13:50.544 --> 13:52.704
Where the fuck are you going?!

13:57.624 --> 14:03.303
I was saving stuff,
putting a little bit aside,

14:03.304 --> 14:05.264
ever since the first scan.

14:10.024 --> 14:16.343
Nicked some copper wire from Maine
Road for this... and the snow suit.

14:16.344 --> 14:19.063
It's beautiful stuff.

14:19.064 --> 14:20.863
Quality gear. We could sell it?

14:20.864 --> 14:22.943
It's got to be
a hundred quid's worth.

14:22.944 --> 14:25.144
It's a night out
at the very least!

14:35.864 --> 14:39.103
I can't tell you what
a tonic this is.

14:39.104 --> 14:40.543
Yes.

14:40.544 --> 14:42.743
You see, I always hated her
for abandoning us,

14:42.744 --> 14:47.863
for what she did to my father...
but you paint a picture of a woman

14:47.864 --> 14:50.623
who was living life to the full.

14:50.624 --> 14:57.463
I really do now have to be going.
Thank you, goodbye.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.023
It makes me feel somehow
better about it...

15:00.024 --> 15:02.823
inheriting money from
a woman I barely knew,

15:02.824 --> 15:05.824
a houseful of possessions...

15:07.064 --> 15:11.303
Perhaps I could stay
for just one more.

15:11.304 --> 15:13.944
There's so much to tell.

15:19.464 --> 15:21.864
Does that make you feel better?

15:24.784 --> 15:26.584
What goes on in your head?

15:27.664 --> 15:30.743
Are you having an affair?
D'you want shot of me?

15:30.744 --> 15:33.703
No. And no.

15:33.704 --> 15:36.144
What's going on, then?

15:39.664 --> 15:42.943
I'm struggling to see the common
ground, baby. It worries me.

15:42.944 --> 15:44.183
Common ground?

15:44.184 --> 15:45.303
I mean like...

15:45.304 --> 15:46.943
I know what it means.

15:46.944 --> 15:51.423
I like Batman, I like all graphic
novels. They're... works of art.

15:51.424 --> 15:55.743
And I wouldn't vote in the election
cos politics is bollocks.

15:55.744 --> 15:58.423
It's all bought and paid
for in advance.

15:58.424 --> 16:01.303
You vote for whatever cunt
offends you least.

16:01.304 --> 16:04.024
You think you'd married
a gimp or summat?

16:05.944 --> 16:12.024
I'm sorry if I offended you.
Doesn't change the problem, though.

16:14.064 --> 16:17.104
I'm going for a drink... on my own.

16:36.464 --> 16:37.863
Marty?

16:37.864 --> 16:40.824
I don't want another baby
wearing this stuff...

16:44.864 --> 16:46.223
Sorry...

16:46.224 --> 16:49.143
I just blurted it out.

16:49.144 --> 16:51.303
I thought a night out
would do us good.

16:51.304 --> 16:53.664
I'll get a sub off Lillian,
that'll see us right.

17:06.104 --> 17:09.743
Compliments on a postcard,
please, ladies.

17:12.864 --> 17:17.143
You don't think it's a bit OTT for a
job interview, I mean, at your age?

17:17.144 --> 17:19.943
Making the most of her assets.
Your dad's not earning,

17:19.944 --> 17:23.143
so it's down to your mum
to bring in the bacon.

17:23.144 --> 17:25.782
I am stuffed into this.
Too much...?

17:25.784 --> 17:31.223
Not enough, in my humble.
Designed to hypnotise, cleavage...

17:31.224 --> 17:32.824
it's what God intended.

17:34.584 --> 17:35.943
Too low?

17:35.944 --> 17:37.863
If I was a fella...

17:37.864 --> 17:40.703
I'd ride you. Don't know
if I'd give you a job,

17:40.704 --> 17:42.904
but I would definitely ride you.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.143
What are you so nervous about?

17:49.144 --> 17:52.783
I hate job interviews.
I get all sweaty, I crumble.

17:52.784 --> 17:54.023
You're smart.

17:54.024 --> 17:56.943
Not when people are judging me,
looking at me.

17:56.944 --> 17:58.264
Hate it, always have done.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.583
Right. What's the damage?

18:01.584 --> 18:04.503
Oh, it'll save
until you get your first pay packet.

18:04.504 --> 18:05.942
You'll do it just like this
tomorrow?

18:05.943 --> 18:08.144
I'll have you skipping
down the street to that interview,

18:08.145 --> 18:10.143
looking a million dollars.

18:10.144 --> 18:12.784
Right! Best get out of this,
hang it up.

18:14.784 --> 18:16.184
Get off!

18:42.424 --> 18:47.303
Some guys don't like how
their missus looks in the morning,

18:47.304 --> 18:50.863
but I love it ... little puffy eyes,
adjusting, like a little chipmunk.

18:50.864 --> 18:56.223
I can suck a banana right
out of its skin, no hands.

18:56.224 --> 18:58.303
Hello, Daddy.

18:58.304 --> 19:02.223
She was dry-humping him
like a horny schoolie!

19:02.224 --> 19:03.304
She is a horny schoolie!

19:03.305 --> 19:04.703
Is there any other kind?

19:04.704 --> 19:07.223
I don't see what's so funny here.

19:07.224 --> 19:10.223
Your brand-new
out-of-the-box husband

19:10.224 --> 19:12.583
was firing into another woman.

19:12.584 --> 19:13.943
I told him to.

19:13.944 --> 19:17.703
I was gonna take a fucking
drill to his head,

19:17.704 --> 19:19.383
but I thought, "No, you know what?

19:19.384 --> 19:21.623
"You might want..."
What did you just say?

19:21.624 --> 19:24.503
I told him to. It was my idea.

19:24.504 --> 19:26.623
It's true,
I don't understand either,

19:26.624 --> 19:29.783
so don't ask. I don't want it.

19:29.784 --> 19:33.863
I want us to see other people.
I want an open relationship.

19:33.864 --> 19:35.022
It's not right.

19:35.023 --> 19:36.264
It's disgusting.

19:37.424 --> 19:40.223
I think it's a great idea.

19:40.224 --> 19:43.783
Excellent,
enter the Daily fucking Bugle.

19:43.784 --> 19:46.623
Don't it make you feel
guilty about what you're doing?

19:46.624 --> 19:49.783
Not a bit. I've earned it.

19:49.784 --> 19:50.584
You're taking his
inheritance off him.

19:50.585 --> 19:53.143
He won't miss something
he's never had.

19:53.144 --> 19:55.624
And if he gets some
relief from knowing that his mother

19:55.625 --> 20:00.343
didn't entirely hate him, may even
have had some affection for him,

20:00.344 --> 20:01.863
I'd say it's money well spent.

20:01.864 --> 20:04.783
You're meant to be setting an
example, we're impressionable.

20:04.784 --> 20:09.223
You are a bollocks. You haven't been
impressionable since you bought

20:09.224 --> 20:13.783
your first pack of
20 king size, aged seven.

20:13.784 --> 20:18.503
And her ... you can act
like Lady Muck all you please.

20:18.504 --> 20:21.624
You have pram-face
written all over you.

20:22.664 --> 20:24.544
You really are horrible.

20:28.024 --> 20:32.303
My advice to you is watch and learn.

20:32.304 --> 20:37.104

problems in the bud.

21:46.144 --> 21:47.503
What future problems?

21:47.504 --> 21:49.783
There's a quarter of a century
between us.

21:49.784 --> 21:52.783
I don't want to be looking
over my shoulder all the time,

21:52.784 --> 21:54.624
waiting for that to bite me
on the arse.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.583
And the solution is for him
to shag other women?

21:57.584 --> 22:01.383
Amongst other things.
I can't be "all women" to Billy,

22:01.384 --> 22:03.983
and it'd be humiliating to try.

22:03.984 --> 22:09.063
There's stuff in his life where
I don't fit in, and vice versa.

22:09.064 --> 22:12.583
Now that is a very healthy attitude.

22:12.584 --> 22:13.983
I mean, people just...

22:13.984 --> 22:21.143
They get hung up about sex.
It gets in the way of everything.

22:21.144 --> 22:22.224
What the fuck's that for?

22:22.225 --> 22:25.063
Cos I can't fucking slap her.

22:25.064 --> 22:27.063
And that's where you come in, son.

22:27.064 --> 22:31.023
He's reluctant, and you're my son
and I trust you.

22:31.024 --> 22:34.263
And that's why I want you
to take your stepfather out

22:34.264 --> 22:35.703
and get him laid.

22:35.704 --> 22:38.823
And there is a sentence
I never thought I'd hear

22:38.824 --> 22:41.184

22:42.944 --> 22:45.463
Sorry ... I'll slow up.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.263
You do realise, don't you?

22:47.264 --> 22:50.583
There's not a court in this land
that'd convict,

22:50.584 --> 22:52.784
if I chopped the fucking
lot of you up right now.

22:52.785 --> 22:55.303
Please, son.

22:55.304 --> 22:56.463
I'll do it.

22:56.464 --> 22:58.463
I'll do it on one condition.

I fancy throwing some shapes.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.903
I'm sure there'll be
a line-up of guys

27:47.904 --> 27:50.343
can't wait to get
on the floor with you.

27:50.344 --> 27:53.383
I'll stay here with Mimi.
..If that's OK with you?

27:53.384 --> 27:55.063
Sound.

27:55.064 --> 27:58.024
Right, I'll get some more drinks in.

28:02.584 --> 28:05.463
Off you trot
to the dance floor, Turkey.

28:05.464 --> 28:07.583
Choosing you over me

28:07.584 --> 28:10.223
qualifies as a fetish.

28:10.224 --> 28:12.183
You know that, don't you?

28:12.184 --> 28:13.784
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

28:16.504 --> 28:18.864
I might just do that.

28:20.144 --> 28:22.423
Ha-ha!

28:22.424 --> 28:25.704
♪ FAITHLESS: Insomnia

28:29.304 --> 28:31.223
I know what you're going through.

28:31.224 --> 28:33.743
Before Letitia finally
came along, we...

28:33.744 --> 28:36.664
It wasn't easy. Avril didn't
leave the house for weeks.

28:38.784 --> 28:40.024
Kelly seems to be coping OK, though.

28:40.025 --> 28:43.024
Well, she's not OK!
She's fucking not!

28:44.864 --> 28:46.784
Didn't mean anything.

28:49.024 --> 28:51.144
Get the fuck off her!

29:25.544 --> 29:27.023
Was that so bad?

29:27.024 --> 29:28.223
No.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.864
Do you need me to accompany
you to the bedroom?

29:29.865 --> 29:31.503
No.

29:31.504 --> 29:32.584
You can if you want.

29:34.064 --> 29:37.143
I don't think I could afford
the therapy, love.

29:37.144 --> 29:39.824
Just make sure you ride him good,
will you?

29:50.264 --> 29:52.263
God almighty!

29:52.264 --> 29:53.863
What's going on?

29:53.864 --> 29:55.583
Nothing.

29:55.584 --> 29:58.343
What are you doing here?!

29:58.344 --> 30:00.183
I wanted to see you sleeping.

30:00.184 --> 30:02.024
Why?

30:03.744 --> 30:05.583
I've done all right.

30:05.584 --> 30:07.983
I'm leading a decent life...

30:07.984 --> 30:11.583
good job, no wife yet,
but there's time.

30:11.584 --> 30:13.143
I'm proud of where I've got to.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.503
As you should be.

30:14.504 --> 30:17.423
I should be fucked up with
everything that was done to me.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.544
I need to know why she left.

30:20.824 --> 30:22.823
I need you to leave this house.

30:22.824 --> 30:24.823
I won't hurt you.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.663
Oh, I know that...

30:26.664 --> 30:28.664
but you have to go.

30:34.224 --> 30:35.304
Yeah.

30:44.184 --> 30:45.744
Cheers.

30:53.424 --> 30:55.023
Fuck me, you're a smooth one.

30:55.024 --> 30:56.344
Not really.

30:59.704 --> 31:02.343
Listen, I'm no expert.

31:02.344 --> 31:04.663
You only have to ask my ex-wives,

31:04.664 --> 31:07.784
but something's not right here.
What's going on?

31:11.744 --> 31:13.783
I'm married. Happily.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.224
You can't be that happy.

31:17.864 --> 31:21.103
We're trying an open relationship.

31:21.104 --> 31:22.024
So, this...

31:22.025 --> 31:23.783
Is the only thing I can think of

31:23.784 --> 31:26.224
to keep me and my fella together
in the long term.

31:26.225 --> 31:27.863
There's an age issue.

31:27.864 --> 31:30.423
I don't want it looming over us
in years to come.

31:30.424 --> 31:33.744
And you really don't want
to sleep with other men?

31:35.504 --> 31:38.343
We've both got to do it
or it won't work, you see?

31:38.344 --> 31:40.704
Bizarrely, I think I do.

31:41.944 --> 31:44.824
Pity ... I can peel a satsuma
with this tongue.

What a night.

33:18.780 --> 33:21.339
I don't even remember
getting home, though.

33:21.340 --> 33:24.859
You woke the whole house,
needing money for the taxi!

33:24.860 --> 33:26.420
You owe me ten... £20!

33:27.860 --> 33:29.420
Jesus, what happened to you?!

33:31.980 --> 33:33.779
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

What do you care?

33:43.340 --> 33:44.500
I don't, really.

33:44.501 --> 33:47.899
I used to think you were a victim
of circumstance

33:47.900 --> 33:51.179
and now I can see you're just stupid.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.300
Stupid?

33:54.580 --> 33:57.139
Like the bloke
whose grief you're ripping off?

33:57.140 --> 33:59.700
Got your mitts in the will yet?

34:08.139 --> 34:10.179
Doesn't look that bad.

34:10.179 --> 34:12.179
I'm a fucking peanut smuggler!

34:12.179 --> 34:14.540
You could hang your trilby off these.

Oh, behave! I have breasts
and an arse and a muff.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.219
This shouldn't be news to you.

34:21.219 --> 34:23.739
In my first job,
it was considered a privilege

34:23.739 --> 34:26.739
to be bent over the boss's desk
for a spanking.

34:26.739 --> 34:29.498
Oh, the things that feminism's
robbed us of, eh?

34:29.500 --> 34:32.458
Though, if it had been a bloke
doing the interview,

34:32.460 --> 34:34.819
you'd be on Easy Street by now.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.780
Maybe you blew her away in the chat.

34:36.781 --> 34:42.139
Let me see... once we established
I had no relevant qualifications

34:42.139 --> 34:45.659
or experience to speak of ...
a subject we kept returning to...

34:45.659 --> 34:48.219
Why'd they have you in,
if you had nothing to offer?

34:48.219 --> 34:50.380
That's exactly what she said...

34:51.420 --> 34:53.859
"Precisely,
what do you have to offer?"

34:53.860 --> 34:57.179
Well... the thing is, I...

34:57.180 --> 34:58.980
What would you say
is your breast quality?

34:58.981 --> 35:00.139
Pardon?

35:00.140 --> 35:02.180
Your breast quality.

35:03.900 --> 35:06.260
My best quality? Just nipple.

35:07.340 --> 35:08.739
Oh, dear!

35:08.740 --> 35:10.059
How embarrassing.

35:10.060 --> 35:11.060
You think?

35:12.060 --> 35:16.060
Look, I'm good
and I'm fucking clever!

35:17.220 --> 35:19.899
But if paper-smart's what counts,

35:19.900 --> 35:23.100
there's a bucketful out
in the corridor fit the bill better.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.699
Look, there's plenty more jobs
in the sea.

Yeah, all night.

Inside out, and upside down.

36:53.980 --> 36:57.659
Come on! This is just getting
tasteless now.

36:57.660 --> 36:58.660
You really did it?

I did it for us.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.699
I haven't washed, to prove it.

37:12.700 --> 37:13.739
Oh, don't!

37:13.740 --> 37:16.779
I am fucking serious, right?!

37:16.780 --> 37:19.340
I can't take this any more.

37:20.860 --> 37:22.380
Not another fucking word!

37:23.700 --> 37:24.940
Did he try and pork you?

37:24.941 --> 37:29.899
You read about such things ...
folk have a fetish for the horrific.

There was no porking ...
attempted or otherwise.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.899
Blackmail him... or call the cops.

37:35.900 --> 37:38.619
He's a paedophile.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.819
No...
the opposite of a paedophile.

37:40.820 --> 37:43.459
I can be unkind to you sometimes.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.739
But you are conclusive proof

37:45.740 --> 37:49.019
that modern culture
is rotting the brains of our youth.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.220
We could ask Jamie to sort him out.

No!

He's got something coming, love.

May I?

Please.

38:15.780 --> 38:16.819
I'm sorry.

38:16.820 --> 38:18.379
No need.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.299
You have to understand that...

38:20.300 --> 38:22.940
I do. A mother's love is important.

38:24.180 --> 38:26.059
All those gobshites there think...

38:26.060 --> 38:29.939
I'm about to rip money
out of your pocket

38:29.940 --> 38:30.979
but I'm not.

38:30.980 --> 38:33.859
I couldn't give a monkey's fart
about the money.

38:33.860 --> 38:36.579
I'll tell you the truth
about your mother,

38:36.580 --> 38:38.699
if you promise to leave here
afterwards

38:38.700 --> 38:40.980
and never contact me again.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.020
OK.

38:44.060 --> 38:47.020
I have one further condition.

38:48.060 --> 38:52.100
You said your mammy had a house
full of possessions.

38:53.740 --> 38:55.700
There is one item
of sentimental value

38:55.701 --> 38:57.579
I would very much like to have.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.499
It's an album of photographs.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.740
Anything, I...

39:02.220 --> 39:03.620
I just need to know.

39:06.140 --> 39:09.540
Her name was Irene Felice O'Donnell.

39:10.700 --> 39:13.620
She was born
on the 22nd August 1939,

39:14.820 --> 39:17.860
not '42, as her birth certificate
would attest.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.620
She never loved your father.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.219
Whatever you may think of him,

39:25.220 --> 39:28.780
he wasn't a nice man ...
a bully, aggressive.

39:31.220 --> 39:35.700
She married him on the rebound
from the love of her life.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.940
That would be me.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.859
I consider my time with your mummy

39:49.860 --> 39:52.060
the best days I ever had.

40:08.860 --> 40:11.419
Rule one ... never stay the night.

40:11.420 --> 40:12.220
Quick shag, then home.

40:12.221 --> 40:13.299
Mm-hm.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.299
Two ... always, always wear a johnny.

40:28.980 --> 40:30.500
don't need those pictures
in my head.

40:30.501 --> 40:31.779
Fair enough.

40:31.780 --> 40:35.779
No-one over the age of 25...
I'm your personal MILF.

40:35.780 --> 40:39.779
(LAUGHS) No...one under the age
of 35 ... I'm your spunky, young lad.

40:39.780 --> 40:42.739

41:06.860 --> 41:08.499
But I thought it was your idea.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.779
And it's the right idea.

41:10.780 --> 41:12.620
Doesn't make it any easier, though.

43:00.980 --> 43:02.820
Our baby's name was Cherry Belle.

43:09.340 --> 43:11.060
She'll always be with us.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.419
Thank you.

43:25.420 --> 43:26.460
That's it now.

43:27.700 --> 43:31.100
It's time to...
stop grieving and start living.

43:32.420 --> 43:33.620
Where are you going?

43:35.140 --> 43:37.699
It's time I got back on the horse,
so to speak.

43:37.700 --> 43:39.859
I'm taking a shift at work.

43:39.860 --> 43:40.979
You can't.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.419
I mean...

43:42.420 --> 43:46.020
ain't it disrespectful...
to the baby?

44:03.340 --> 44:05.260
Oh, I'm shot to bits.

44:06.780 --> 44:08.979
So am I ... don't know if I'll last.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.419
Oh, come on, babe.

44:10.420 --> 44:12.660
I've been looking forward to this
all day.

44:13.700 --> 44:14.900
It's your chapter.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.419
Where did we stop?

44:17.420 --> 44:19.979
Sirius Black has escaped
from Azkaban,

44:19.980 --> 44:23.339
and Ron and Hermione
think he's coming after Harry.

44:23.340 --> 44:26.339
'They say that you get your reward
in heaven.

44:26.340 --> 44:28.979
'But they also say
that time waits for no man...

44:28.980 --> 44:30.220
'or woman.'

44:37.500 --> 44:39.980
'If you don't want to wait
until you get to heaven,

44:39.981 --> 44:43.380
'then you have to grab what you can,
when you can.'

44:54.340 --> 44:56.219
'We can't wait for others to fail

44:56.220 --> 44:58.979
'or for them to succeed
and give us what we need,

44:58.980 --> 45:02.059
'because our time here
can be so short

45:02.060 --> 45:04.980
'and we can't wait for the rest
of the world to catch up.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.139
'So if you're lucky
and if you work at it

45:09.140 --> 45:11.419
'and throw yourself into it

45:11.420 --> 45:13.499
'then you might, just might

45:13.500 --> 45:16.940
'get your reward,
right here on Earth.'

45:19.700 --> 45:20.780
I think I'm in love.

45:20.781 --> 45:22.219
Not the spaz?! Fuck off!

45:22.220 --> 45:24.220
Say you did shag a bird
in a wheeler, wouldn't it hurt?

45:24.221 --> 45:26.779
Maybe, if you let the brakes off!

45:26.780 --> 45:29.180
Don't want to be another lad.
I want to be your lad.

45:29.181 --> 45:31.139
Got anywhere to go? Want a Viagra?

45:31.140 --> 45:33.979
I never go anywhere
without my little bits.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.339
Outside.

45:35.340 --> 45:37.020
Can't we just do it in the... Oof!

45:38.220 --> 45:40.979
I'm your Auntie Angel.
Say hello to your auntie!

45:40.980 --> 45:42.779
Eww.

45:42.780 --> 45:46.339
I want to strap you onto me
and fuck you till your eyes water.

46:32.140 --> 46:35.980
And that is how one peels a satsuma,
using only the tongue.

46:36.980 --> 46:39.619
We have got to go upstairs
right now.

46:39.620 --> 46:41.219
The night's young, Gloria.

46:41.220 --> 46:44.860
I'm so wet,
I might slip off me chair. Now!
