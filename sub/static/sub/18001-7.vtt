<i>(Theme music playing)</i>

00:07.301 --> 00:09.643
What was the most beneficial super power

00:09.678 --> 00:11.319
for anyone who works at the stash?

00:11.354 --> 00:13.560
- Be able to read minds.
- Read minds?

00:13.594 --> 00:15.268
Yeah. Let's say, for instance,

00:15.303 --> 00:17.076
some guy comes in with an action figure...

00:17.111 --> 00:18.313
- Okay.
- Looking to sell it.

00:18.347 --> 00:20.821
- Right.
- The negotiation is over.

00:20.856 --> 00:23.031
Yeah, but that might not
be the price that you'll get.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.838
So what? I don't have to
do-si-do anymore with the dude.

00:25.873 --> 00:28.344
Don't you like that
little bit of back and forth?

00:28.379 --> 00:31.550
No. I'd much rather be done with it.

00:31.584 --> 00:33.857
What about you? What would
be the best power to have?

00:33.891 --> 00:35.296
Invisibility.

00:35.331 --> 00:37.501
Nobody would ever steal from here again.

00:37.536 --> 00:39.976
[Laughter]

00:40.010 --> 00:43.852
So now, I'm paying you just
to stand at the front door

00:43.886 --> 00:46.427
and be invisible for eight hours a day?

00:46.461 --> 00:49.365
He performs the same task
as a fake security camera.

00:49.399 --> 00:52.037
[Laughter]

00:52.073 --> 00:53.576
What about you? You got one?

00:53.611 --> 00:56.049
I can't think of one that I would waste.

00:56.084 --> 00:58.958
I can stay here. [Laughter]

00:58.992 --> 01:01.363

Hello, and welcome to another episode

01:36.477 --> 01:38.480
<i>of Comic Book Men, the only show</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.953
that thought itself worthy
enough to lift Mjolnir,

01:40.988 --> 01:42.656
but only got real Thor.

01:42.691 --> 01:43.725
I'm Kevin Smith.

01:43.759 --> 01:45.161
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:45.195 --> 01:46.963
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:46.998 --> 01:49.334
I'm hungry for food, and
I'm hungry for answers, man.

01:49.368 --> 01:51.004
What happened at the store this week?

01:51.038 --> 01:53.343
The other day a guy
brought in a couple of items...

01:53.377 --> 01:55.415
something that I remember
from my childhood.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.488
- Hey, how you doing?
- What's cracking?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.689
- What's going on, now?
- What's up, man?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.258
Got a question for you.

02:04.293 --> 02:06.697
Are you guys into any
of that John Kaiju stuff?

02:06.731 --> 02:08.366
What do you mean, like Godzilla?

02:08.401 --> 02:10.102
- Godzilla, stuff like that.
- We're into that.

02:10.137 --> 02:13.344
- What do you got?
- Ready? Ready?

02:13.378 --> 02:16.247
- Oh.
- Boom, check it.

02:16.282 --> 02:17.716
- Ultraman, right?
- You got it.

02:23.093 --> 02:24.595
I'm a big Ultraman fan.
It's kind of cult here

02:24.629 --> 02:26.193
in the U.S., wouldn't you agree though?

02:26.227 --> 02:27.593
Right, right. Well,
yeah. I was raised on it,

02:27.627 --> 02:29.227
- my man, I was raised on it.
- Oh, yeah?

02:29.261 --> 02:30.596
I have never seen Asian people before,

02:30.630 --> 02:32.398
until I started watching Ultraman.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.231
So there you go, my man. There you go.

02:34.265 --> 02:35.798
Goes around in a big circle, right?

02:35.833 --> 02:37.534
Was it a big surprise
to you when you found out

02:37.568 --> 02:39.203
they all couldn't turn into Ultramen?

02:39.237 --> 02:41.435
Yeah, it was, you know.

02:41.469 --> 02:42.937
I was a fan of Ultraman.

02:42.971 --> 02:44.371
He was a protector of the asians.

02:44.405 --> 02:45.972
I was a big fan. I don't recall

02:46.007 --> 02:47.873
watching any episode
where he just declared,

02:47.908 --> 02:49.307
"I'm only gonna protect Asian people."

02:49.341 --> 02:50.974
[Laughter]

02:51.009 --> 02:53.540
Okay, well, I didn't
see that part, but I mean...

02:53.574 --> 02:56.742
that part I made up
in my head and heart.

02:56.776 --> 02:59.877
"Ha ha ha ha, let those
white people die, Ultraman."

02:59.911 --> 03:02.078
[Laughter]

03:02.113 --> 03:03.448
Where'd you get these at?

03:03.482 --> 03:04.950
A friend of mine was teaching

03:04.985 --> 03:06.986
conversational English in Japan.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.592
He knew I was an Ultraman
geek, so he kind of,

03:09.627 --> 03:12.725
sort of worked around
the law to get them to me,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.327
because they were not
allowed to be released

03:14.361 --> 03:15.895
- out of the country.
- Really?

03:15.930 --> 03:17.495
You're looking at some contraband.

03:17.529 --> 03:19.498
So there you go.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.171
Are you sure that there
wasn't something packed

03:22.205 --> 03:24.905
- inside the Ultraman?
- No, no, no.

03:24.939 --> 03:27.239
- Come on, man.
- [Laughter]

03:27.274 --> 03:28.741
I don't know how much I believe that.

03:28.775 --> 03:31.311
I can't imagine that

03:31.345 --> 03:33.446
there was some sort
of ban on, you know...

03:33.480 --> 03:35.113
<i>like midnight express.</i>

03:35.147 --> 03:37.480
He has, like, a bunch of
Ultramans around his waist.

03:37.514 --> 03:40.615
- Guns trained on him.
- [Laughter]

03:40.649 --> 03:41.949
All right, what are
you wanting for them?

03:41.983 --> 03:44.316
Like, a hunny apiece.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.350
- A hundred apiece.
- Oh, oh, a hunny apiece?

03:46.384 --> 03:47.852
A hunny apiece.

03:47.887 --> 03:50.123
Oh, so your looking
to get 200 for these?

03:50.158 --> 03:52.828
See, I really don't know that
much about the pricing of them,

03:52.863 --> 03:55.334
but I do have someone in the store today

03:55.368 --> 03:56.802
who actually, probably does.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.471
Would you mind if I brought him over?

03:58.505 --> 03:59.973
- Sure, why not.
- Hey, Robert?

04:00.007 --> 04:01.342
- Yeah.
- Can you come here for one sec?

04:01.376 --> 04:03.142
Sure thing, Walt.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.478
More than just a pop
culturalist, Rob Bruce,

04:05.513 --> 04:08.480
who we turn to for a lot of deeper looks

04:08.514 --> 04:10.380
to some of the products
that come through the doors...

04:10.414 --> 04:13.983
also world renowned as the kaiju expert.

04:14.018 --> 04:15.349
Yeah, he's, like, the collector.

04:15.384 --> 04:17.784
He just goes around collecting titles.

04:17.819 --> 04:19.618
[Laughter]

04:19.653 --> 04:23.886
Sound battlers, wow.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.385
This was actually produced

04:25.419 --> 04:27.019
<i>as a show called Ultraman
towards the future.</i>

04:27.054 --> 04:28.287
- In Australia.
- Right.

04:28.321 --> 04:29.788
This was distributed in the U.S.

04:29.822 --> 04:31.657
This was the last time
that actually Ultraman

04:31.692 --> 04:32.959
was on the U.S. soil.

04:32.994 --> 04:35.628
- Mm-hmm.
- So he's come in today.

04:35.662 --> 04:38.130
He wants to sell them. He's
looking to get a hunny each.

04:38.165 --> 04:41.402
- What's a hunny?
- A hundred, c-note, Benjamin...

04:41.436 --> 04:43.575
is that a fair price

04:43.609 --> 04:45.677
would that I'd be paying for these today?

04:45.711 --> 04:47.546
Well, I... you know,
if they were boxed...

04:47.580 --> 04:50.151
but the thing is, the reason
they didn't come in boxes,

04:50.186 --> 04:52.687
my buddy had to smuggle
these bad boys through.

04:52.721 --> 04:54.654
- Contraband, he's saying.
- Contraband.

04:54.688 --> 04:56.523
I don't understand that.

04:56.557 --> 04:59.090
I think he just could've mailed
them and not worried about it.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.220
How about 1990... 93, 94?

05:01.220 --> 05:03.160
I've got a pretty big collection,

05:03.194 --> 05:04.659
and a lot of it I bought in the '90s,

05:04.694 --> 05:06.991
and I wasn't smuggling it out ofapan.

05:07.026 --> 05:08.426
It's about to get heated up in here.

05:08.460 --> 05:09.694
Well, my stuff is smuggled.

05:09.728 --> 05:11.428
Getting back to $100 apiece...

05:11.463 --> 05:14.194
I don't see that.

05:14.228 --> 05:16.763
So, Robert, what is the
retail on these two pieces?

05:16.798 --> 05:19.263
Probably $65 apiece,

05:19.298 --> 05:20.598
which means if I was going to buy them,

05:20.632 --> 05:22.367
I'd buy them for 25 bucks apiece.

05:22.401 --> 05:23.734
Wow.

05:23.769 --> 05:25.402
- But that's me.
- Kicked me in the nuts.

05:25.437 --> 05:26.537
Didn't even lift your leg.

05:26.571 --> 05:28.003
Oh, my lord.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.337
- That's him.
- That's him.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.839
- Yeah.
- We talking to you.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.339
I mean, I'd be more
interested in this guy

05:32.373 --> 05:34.674
than the Australia one.

05:34.708 --> 05:37.944
The narrow... what are... what
are... what are you looking at?

05:37.979 --> 05:39.111
The other thing to
concern yourself with...

05:39.145 --> 05:40.512
oh, man, he's back.

05:40.546 --> 05:42.214
It's bandai. It's not x-plus.

05:42.248 --> 05:45.351
Now, if they were x-plus
figures, they'd be hot.

05:45.385 --> 05:46.785
40?

05:46.819 --> 05:49.689
60.

05:49.723 --> 05:52.357
- 45.
- 55.

05:52.391 --> 05:55.457
I'm gonna... I'm gonna stay at 45.

05:55.491 --> 05:57.627
- Ten bucks?
- Ten bucks is ten bucks.

05:57.662 --> 05:58.795
It's the difference between making

05:58.829 --> 06:00.464
a profit and breaking even.

06:00.498 --> 06:02.600
Keeping the lights on
and having them turned off.

06:02.635 --> 06:04.735
I think you better watch
out. You're about to have

06:04.769 --> 06:08.473
your lights turned out, it looks like.

06:08.507 --> 06:10.405
Okay, all right, all right, I'll go 50.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.172
And, you know it, just...
50 as long as he don't-

06:12.207 --> 06:13.475
he walked out in one piece?

06:13.509 --> 06:14.644
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:14.679 --> 06:15.778
- 50 and no punch.
- Is that good?

06:15.813 --> 06:17.346
50 and no punching?

06:17.380 --> 06:18.681
He just saved you.

06:18.715 --> 06:21.420
50 and no punching. [Laughter]

06:21.454 --> 06:23.790
- We good?
- We're good, 50.

06:23.824 --> 06:25.625
You owe us, rob.

06:25.659 --> 06:27.696
I think I do.

06:27.730 --> 06:30.163
Kevin, as promised, I'm here.

06:30.197 --> 06:31.665
Brought something special to show you guys.

06:31.699 --> 06:33.000
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.799
I don't mean this
in an... in a bad way,

06:39.834 --> 06:42.399
but at times, I find myself challenged by,

06:42.434 --> 06:43.600
like, hanging out with you guys.

06:43.635 --> 06:45.533
But I think, like, if I had myself

06:45.568 --> 06:46.966
to talk to and hang out with,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.199
like, go to ball games,
go out to dinner with...

06:49.233 --> 06:51.467
I think I'd be really, really happy.

06:51.501 --> 06:52.934
Like, you're driving down the street.

06:52.969 --> 06:54.402
You see a comic book shop, and you're like,

06:54.436 --> 06:56.038
"ooh, let's stop
there," and he's like...

06:56.072 --> 06:57.372
"should we stop?" And,
you know, like, my clone

06:57.407 --> 06:59.307
- goes, "why'd you even ask?"
- Right.

06:59.341 --> 07:01.076
We're not together all the time,

07:01.111 --> 07:04.047
but we spend as much time
together as humanly possible.

07:04.082 --> 07:06.149
So you guys don't bang
is what you're saying?

07:06.183 --> 07:07.716
Well, that's...

07:07.751 --> 07:08.949
- that's good to hear.
- Well, I mean, come on.

07:08.983 --> 07:10.683
I mean, we have so much in common.

07:10.717 --> 07:12.318
Eventually it's gonna cross our minds.

07:12.353 --> 07:15.455
Maybe he'd turn... he'd turn you.

07:15.490 --> 07:17.591
If anybody could turn me, it's me.

07:17.626 --> 07:20.392
[Laughter]

07:26.702 --> 07:28.269
<i>Captain America: Winter soldier.</i>

07:28.303 --> 07:30.706
- That's a one.
- Put plus one on there.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.908
<i>- Batman: Earth 1.
- Put down plus three.</i>

07:32.943 --> 07:34.441
- Hey, guys.
- Kevin.

07:34.475 --> 07:35.942
- How's it going?
- How you doing?

07:35.976 --> 07:38.610
As promised, I'm here.

07:38.644 --> 07:41.010
Brought something special to show you guys.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.113
So one of the coolest things
that we've been doing lately

07:43.148 --> 07:44.349
is hitting the con circuit.

07:44.383 --> 07:45.849
And the coolest part's meeting

07:45.884 --> 07:47.716
some of the big creators
that we'd buy our...

07:47.750 --> 07:49.115
naturally, man, you're rubbing elbows.

07:49.149 --> 07:50.649
You're right there with them.

07:50.683 --> 07:51.983
And one of the guys
that we've been kind of

07:52.017 --> 07:53.884
making friends with is Kevin eastman,

07:53.918 --> 07:56.048
<i>co-creator of the teenage
mutant Ninja Turtles.</i>

07:56.083 --> 07:58.282
Heroes on the half shell, man. Heavens.

07:58.316 --> 07:59.782
Last time we saw him at a con,

07:59.817 --> 08:01.952
he mentioned that he
had, in his possession,

08:01.986 --> 08:03.885
the first ever turtles sketch

08:03.920 --> 08:05.285
- that he did.
- Really?

08:05.319 --> 08:06.618
And he said if he was ever in the area,

08:06.653 --> 08:08.019
he would show us,

08:08.053 --> 08:09.787
and sure enough, he came in.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.486
It's the turtles' 30th
anniversary this year,

08:12.520 --> 08:14.854
and so we're doing a
lot of shows, celebrating

08:14.889 --> 08:16.588
all the awesome thing
that the turtles have done.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.420
30 years later, you're
still talking about turtles.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.751
Did you ever think that your idea

08:20.785 --> 08:22.818
would profit this long?

08:22.852 --> 08:23.919
You know, not in a million years.

08:23.953 --> 08:25.352
I mean, when Pete and I started out,

08:25.386 --> 08:26.719
we grew up as huge fans of Jack Kirby.

08:26.754 --> 08:28.255
That's all we ever wanted to do,

08:28.289 --> 08:30.053
is write, and draw, and
tell our own stories,

08:30.088 --> 08:32.522
and you know, we sent sampled
around to different publishers,

08:32.556 --> 08:33.923
got all the rejection
letters that everybody gets,

08:33.957 --> 08:35.890
and so instead of sending
it to anybody else,

08:35.924 --> 08:37.424
we said, "let's just publish it ourselves.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.193
Let's do it as a real,
independent comic book."

08:39.227 --> 08:41.462
And then we cleaned out all
$200 of Pete's bank account.

08:41.496 --> 08:43.933
We borrowed $1,000 from an Uncle of mine,

08:43.966 --> 08:46.633
and we had just enough
money to print 3,000 copies.

08:46.668 --> 08:47.968
- Wow.
- It was the first press run.

08:48.003 --> 08:49.436
It sounds like Kevin's story.

08:49.470 --> 08:51.136
Maxed out ten credit cards

08:51.170 --> 08:52.536
and made this little movie
he thought no one would see,

08:52.570 --> 08:54.335
and here we are.

08:54.369 --> 08:55.835
<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>

08:55.869 --> 08:58.101
was not meant to become what it became.

08:58.135 --> 09:00.435
It was kind of a play on what was going on

09:00.470 --> 09:02.103
<i>with Frank Miller's daredevil at the time,</i>

09:02.137 --> 09:03.938
if I remember correctly.

09:03.974 --> 09:07.009
Eventually, it gets picked up,
turned into a cartoon series.

09:07.044 --> 09:08.677
It's become video games.

09:08.712 --> 09:10.111
It's become toys.

09:10.145 --> 09:11.677
But it came from two dudes,

09:11.712 --> 09:14.545
sitting around in Massachusetts,
not working for anybody,

09:14.579 --> 09:16.113
but having fun with themselves,

09:16.147 --> 09:17.780
just going, like, "wouldn't this be cool?"

09:17.814 --> 09:20.649
It's a true American success story.

09:20.683 --> 09:23.286
All right, man, but... so can
we see what's inside the case?

09:23.320 --> 09:25.355
Yes. As promised, I wanted to
bring you guys a special treat,

09:25.390 --> 09:26.889
and I actually found two things,

09:26.924 --> 09:31.058
one I think you'd get
a real big kick out of.

09:31.093 --> 09:34.964
This is the layouts for
the very first issue.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.365
- No way.
- Yeah.

09:37.399 --> 09:39.800
So what we did was I
did all the basic notes

09:39.834 --> 09:42.335
of the pacing on yellow, lined
paper, and then, before we

09:42.369 --> 09:44.667
started on the actual version
layout, I did these layouts.

09:44.702 --> 09:46.870
And this is, you know, how
broke we were in those days.

09:46.905 --> 09:49.875
So this is page one, two, and three,

09:49.910 --> 09:54.081
and then, on the back
is page four and five.

09:54.116 --> 09:56.017
Did you know right from the start

09:56.052 --> 09:57.686
the perfect animal would be a turtle?

09:57.720 --> 10:00.389
The first big inspiration was Bruce Lee.

10:00.423 --> 10:02.158
I was like, "what if
Bruce Lee was an animal?

10:02.193 --> 10:04.895
What would be the dumbest
animal Bruce Lee would be?

10:04.930 --> 10:06.499
And the natural joke

10:06.533 --> 10:08.599
was a slow moving turtle
that could do martial arts.

10:08.633 --> 10:10.503
I got to tell you, man,
this beats any fine art

10:10.537 --> 10:11.937
I've ever seen in a museum.

10:11.971 --> 10:13.372
- Thank you.
- I mean, this is like seeing,

10:13.406 --> 10:14.907
like, an original, like,
Michelangelo, right?

10:14.941 --> 10:16.744
Or the sketches before
he created the Mona Lisa,

10:16.779 --> 10:17.914
- or something.
- Yeah.

10:17.948 --> 10:19.616
- Is that what he did?
- No.

10:19.651 --> 10:21.251
It was one of them.

10:21.286 --> 10:23.455
It was Leonardo,
but he...

10:23.490 --> 10:27.063
so you want to see where it all came from?

10:27.097 --> 10:29.633
The very first doodle... this
is the one I showed Peter.

10:29.668 --> 10:31.404
It was started as a pencil sketch,

10:31.439 --> 10:34.410
and then I had to ink it in
just to clean it up a little bit.

10:34.444 --> 10:36.614
The suspense is killing me.

10:36.649 --> 10:39.387
This rarely leaves the vault.

10:39.422 --> 10:42.857
I figured I'd show you
guys where it all started.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.433
Oh. Here it is. This may be the most

10:46.467 --> 10:49.370
accurate detailed swamp
thing figure ever produced.

10:49.405 --> 10:52.577
This is a super rare, vintage piece.

10:52.612 --> 10:54.147
Oh, my God, where'd you get it?

10:56.966 --> 10:58.721
The teenage mutant
Ninja Turtles have been

10:58.721 --> 10:59.958
around now for decades.

11:00.082 --> 11:01.582
There've been many incarnations.

11:01.616 --> 11:03.316
Let's shoot around and go

11:03.351 --> 11:05.384
favorite incarnation of turtles.

11:05.418 --> 11:07.819
For me, I'm gonna say, hands
down, the black and white

11:07.853 --> 11:09.087
original incarnation.

11:09.121 --> 11:10.855
What about you, Walt?

11:10.889 --> 11:12.691
This turtle doesn't get
enough props as he should,

11:12.725 --> 11:15.861
'cause he's the first
turtle to wield the sword...

11:15.896 --> 11:17.529
touche turtle from Hanna Barbara.

11:17.564 --> 11:19.767
Oh, my... I don't
think anyone's ever made

11:19.801 --> 11:21.035
that drawing comparison.

11:21.069 --> 11:22.436
Holy crap, you're right, man.

11:22.470 --> 11:25.406
He was the original turtle with a weapon.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.274
- Oh, good lord.
- [Laughter]

11:28.309 --> 11:29.375
What about you, Ming?

11:29.409 --> 11:30.943
Who can forget the first movie?

11:30.977 --> 11:33.010
- Oh, big fan of it.
- It was a good balance too,

11:33.044 --> 11:36.181
between the source material
and making it more mainstream.

11:36.215 --> 11:37.881
Like, I remember being in the movie theater

11:37.916 --> 11:39.216
and not feeling like,

11:39.250 --> 11:40.518
"we're watching a kids' movie.

11:40.552 --> 11:43.688
[Laughter]

11:43.722 --> 11:45.255
What about you, Bry?

11:45.290 --> 11:47.022
It would have to be the
movie that I saw with you

11:47.057 --> 11:50.393
since it's the only exposure
to turtles I ever had.

11:55.028 --> 11:56.094
So the other day, we got a little

11:56.129 --> 11:57.162
turtle power in the store.

11:57.196 --> 11:58.863
Kevin eastman, co-creator of

11:58.897 --> 12:00.497
the teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

12:00.531 --> 12:01.998
Last time we saw him at a con,

12:02.032 --> 12:03.797
he mentioned that he
had, in his possession,

12:03.831 --> 12:05.666
the first ever turtles sketch

12:05.700 --> 12:07.235
- that he did.
- Really?

12:07.270 --> 12:09.906
And he brought it by into the store.

12:09.941 --> 12:11.508
That's a piece of comic book history

12:11.542 --> 12:14.045
coming through the door, man.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.415
30 years later, here I am,
still talking about turtles,

12:16.450 --> 12:18.384
still going out and meeting the fans

12:18.418 --> 12:20.719
and doing all that fun stuff,
so I figured I'd show you guys

12:21.054 --> 12:22.886
- where it all started.
- No way.

12:22.921 --> 12:25.322
You want to see the very first doodle?

12:25.357 --> 12:28.262
This rarely leaves the vault.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.736
Oh.

12:32.770 --> 12:35.374
- Oh, my God.
- They've changed a bit.

12:35.409 --> 12:36.909
A little bit.

12:36.943 --> 12:38.511
Wow.

12:38.545 --> 12:40.246
A lot of people ask me
what my favorite turtle is,

12:40.280 --> 12:42.146
and you know, I love them
all. It'd be like choosing

12:42.181 --> 12:43.547
a favorite child, you know what I mean?

12:43.581 --> 12:45.349
But Michelangelo was the
first turtle ever drawn,

12:45.383 --> 12:47.850
so is near and dear to me.

12:47.885 --> 12:50.486
He's got the red cloth.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.386
He's got the bulletproof glass.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.521
- Some lucite casing inside?
- Yeah.

12:54.555 --> 12:56.322
- That's pretty cool, man.
- Oh, yeah.

12:56.356 --> 12:58.157
The original drawing of the turtle,

12:58.191 --> 13:01.861
<i>that, without it, there is no
teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.</i>

13:01.896 --> 13:04.361
How many people do you
think try to shoot that sketch?

13:04.395 --> 13:06.563
[Laughter]

13:06.598 --> 13:08.666
So you showed it to Pete, and
you're like, "what do you think?"

13:08.701 --> 13:10.068
- "Check it out."
- Yeah.

13:10.102 --> 13:11.436
- And what was his reaction?
- Just laughed.

13:11.471 --> 13:12.672
He said, "that's the dumbest thing ever."

13:12.706 --> 13:14.207
And of course,

13:14.241 --> 13:16.442
then he had to do a
drawing to top mine, so...

13:16.476 --> 13:18.209
and of course, I had to top his sketch,

13:18.244 --> 13:20.210
and that's where I did the
pencil of all four of them,

13:20.244 --> 13:22.011
and had it for 30 years,

13:22.045 --> 13:24.281
and we do a lot of work with
a lot of different charities,

13:24.315 --> 13:26.548
and so we figured with
the 30th anniversary,

13:26.583 --> 13:28.183
it would be a great time
to sort of put it out there,

13:28.218 --> 13:29.451
and see if there's someone

13:29.485 --> 13:31.119
that would pay the amount of money

13:31.154 --> 13:32.923
I want for it, $2 million.

13:32.957 --> 13:34.792
And if they don't, then I'll just keep it,

13:34.827 --> 13:37.394
but if they do, then we can
do a lot of good with it.

13:37.429 --> 13:39.527
So this is your first stop
for the independent buyers?

13:39.562 --> 13:42.400
What do we got? -
Yeah, I think I have...

13:42.434 --> 13:43.602
500,000 each?

13:43.637 --> 13:46.438
I'll hit the ATM.

13:46.472 --> 13:48.106
- Wow, that's high.
- Yeah.

13:48.141 --> 13:50.611
- There's only one in existence.
- True.

13:50.645 --> 13:53.113
And it's the bridge to everything.

13:53.147 --> 13:54.881
I mean, it's generated billions.

13:54.915 --> 13:57.783
- âª T-u-r-t-l-e power âª
- [Laughter]

13:57.817 --> 13:59.450
Well, guys, listen,

14:01.251 --> 14:02.919
and chat about this
stuff, but I have to run.

14:02.953 --> 14:04.585
Thank you so much.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.186
Listen, a pleasure... an
absolute pleasure. Bryan...

14:06.221 --> 14:07.787
- nice to meet you.
- Listen, thank you so much.

14:07.822 --> 14:09.523
- Kevin, thank you so much.
- Take care of yourself.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.593
Don't let these guys beat
you up too badly in here.

14:11.627 --> 14:13.527
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- That's true. Thanks again.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.863
See you soon.

14:22.373 --> 14:23.052
All right, man, thanks.

14:23.052 --> 14:24.911
- Have a great day.
- Hi.

14:24.912 --> 14:27.182
Hey. I was hoping to check
out the swamp thing in the back.

14:27.216 --> 14:29.319
Can you bring up the
swamp thing Matty collector

14:29.353 --> 14:31.023
- out of the glass case, please?
- Yeah, no problem.

14:31.058 --> 14:32.358
Thanks.

14:37.129 --> 14:39.896
Here it is. Huh? Huh?

14:39.930 --> 14:42.769
Wow, this is really
great. It's beautiful.

14:42.804 --> 14:44.569
This may be the most accurate,

14:44.603 --> 14:46.834
detailed swamp thing figure ever produced.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.904
I mean, it's got everything from the roots

14:48.939 --> 14:51.442
throughout his body, the mushrooms,

14:51.477 --> 14:54.212
and the tubers, right
here, all along his back.

14:54.246 --> 14:55.880
And those are important.
You'll definitely want those.

14:55.914 --> 14:57.714
- Tell them about the tubers.
- Well, it was swamp thing's way

14:57.748 --> 15:00.650
that he was able to consummate
his relationship with Abigail.

15:00.684 --> 15:03.052
So she would take a bite out
of it and be able to experience

15:03.086 --> 15:05.152
- everything that he experiences.
- Really?

15:05.187 --> 15:06.988
So they could kind of
share a moment together.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.990
It's kind of like... I guess
it was kind of like doing

15:09.024 --> 15:10.325
ecstasy or something.

15:10.359 --> 15:12.027
The first time I'm gonna say this,

15:12.062 --> 15:14.063
but I think I'd eat a dude's tuber.

15:14.097 --> 15:15.463
[Laughter]

15:15.497 --> 15:17.863
I love swamp thing, kids.

15:17.897 --> 15:19.466
Like, that was the first comic book

15:19.502 --> 15:21.403
I ever read where they
took a very dopey premise

15:21.438 --> 15:23.471
and turned it into
absolute literature, man.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.510
That's the stuff that made me
want to try writing comic books,

15:26.545 --> 15:28.414
'cause they took it so seriously

15:28.448 --> 15:30.017
and so earnestly. There was no winking.

15:30.051 --> 15:32.154
They went deep inside
their heads and made them,

15:32.188 --> 15:34.190
kind of, emotional
beings for the first time.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.493
So those issues will
always mean the world to me.

15:36.527 --> 15:38.061
Absolutely.

15:38.096 --> 15:39.532
So what makes swamp thing
your favorite character?

15:39.566 --> 15:41.267
My job is pretty dark.

15:41.301 --> 15:43.270
Sometimes I just want to get
away and think of something

15:43.304 --> 15:45.041
that's gonna take me kind of far away.

15:45.075 --> 15:46.344
What do you do for a
living that's so dark?

15:46.378 --> 15:48.083
I'm a mortician.

15:48.117 --> 15:49.885
Wow. I mean, I know what it's like

15:49.919 --> 15:52.590
to work with dead weight,

15:52.625 --> 15:54.360
but not on that level.

15:54.394 --> 15:55.362
Not on that level.

15:55.397 --> 15:57.063
That's insane.

15:57.098 --> 15:59.465
I found it strange that,
since she works as a mortician,

15:59.499 --> 16:03.236
<i>it would raise her spirits
to read swamp thing.</i>

16:03.271 --> 16:05.570
I could see doing anything other

16:05.605 --> 16:07.305
than dealing with a dead body

16:07.339 --> 16:08.906
would raise your spirits,
you know what I'm saying?

16:08.940 --> 16:11.644
And reading a comic book
can be very life affirming.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.643
Ming had such a dead eye
in his look the whole time,

16:13.677 --> 16:15.111
she actually tried to
embalm him on the spot.

16:15.145 --> 16:17.813
[Laughter]

16:17.847 --> 16:20.579
All right, well, will
you take swamp thing today?

16:20.613 --> 16:21.747
Yeah. It's gonna go home with me.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.315
- All set?
- Absolutely.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.450
All right, let me put
him in his little head case,

16:24.484 --> 16:26.718
and it'll be 99.95.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.819
I was hoping to not
spend that much today.

16:28.853 --> 16:30.286
- Really?
- I was hoping a little bit

16:30.321 --> 16:32.554
more around 75.

16:32.588 --> 16:35.623
I don't know if I
could do that much off.

16:35.657 --> 16:39.763
I could do 90, you
know, take 10% off today.

16:39.797 --> 16:41.968
Can you do 85?

16:42.002 --> 16:43.436
Yeah, I can do 85.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.770
- Great.
- You want to grab the box?

16:44.804 --> 16:45.771
- Yeah, I'll grab the box.
- Okay.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.505
All right.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.774
How many, like, are these in
the world would you estimate?

16:48.808 --> 16:50.411
- I'd say 15.
- 15.

16:50.445 --> 16:52.248
This is considered, like, a holy grail

16:52.283 --> 16:54.785
- of Star Wars collectibles.
- Oh, my God, holy grail.

17:01.151 --> 17:03.919
If you guys could spend just 24 hours

17:03.954 --> 17:07.155
at either Arnold's, meeting
The Fonz and the gang,

17:07.189 --> 17:09.925
or at pop's, meeting Archie and the gang,

17:09.960 --> 17:11.728
which one would you spend the 24 hours in?

17:11.762 --> 17:14.799
I mean, I think you just said
the key word, there... The Fonz.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.704
But you go to Arnold's,
you're nothing but set dressing.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.440
But you go Archie... Riverdale,
you may actually have a chance

17:21.473 --> 17:23.444
of, like, becoming one of part of the gang.

17:23.479 --> 17:25.047
You could replace, like, moose maybe.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.180
[Laughter]

17:27.214 --> 17:28.680
I mean, I'm sorry. Like, with Archie,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.417
is he the coolest one
in Riverdale... Archie?

17:30.451 --> 17:31.787
- Yeah.
- Oh, you could unseat him

17:31.821 --> 17:33.522
in a second. Yeah, you're right.

17:33.556 --> 17:35.256
- I'm going to Riverdale with you.
- You would clean up.

17:35.290 --> 17:38.559
You would have Betty,
Veronica, and midge, and Ethel.

17:38.594 --> 17:40.560
[Laughter]

17:47.674 --> 17:50.274
- Here you go, need a bag?
- No thanks, we're good.

17:50.308 --> 17:52.944
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, guys.

17:52.978 --> 17:55.447
I have a vintage,

17:55.481 --> 17:58.379
<i>1977 Star Wars movie banner</i>

17:58.414 --> 18:00.548
that was displayed in the theater

18:00.583 --> 18:02.419
when the movie first premiered.

18:02.453 --> 18:04.787
Wow, looks like a flying carpet.

18:04.821 --> 18:07.587
This is a super rare, vintage piece.

18:14.158 --> 18:15.893
This is considered, like,

18:15.927 --> 18:17.430
a holy grail of Star Wars collectibles.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.163
Oh, my God, where'd you get it?

18:19.198 --> 18:22.799
My father was friends with
a guy who owned a movie theater

18:22.833 --> 18:25.100
<i>that premiered Star Wars in 1977.</i>

18:25.135 --> 18:28.570
So my father would drop me
off before he went to work,

18:28.605 --> 18:30.308
I would stay there all day

18:30.342 --> 18:32.177
and watch the movie over and over again,

18:32.211 --> 18:33.645
and he'd pick me up on the way home.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.315
And then, when the movie finished playing

18:35.350 --> 18:37.184
- I actually got it for Christmas.
- Wait, wait, wait.

18:37.219 --> 18:39.154
<i>So how many times did you
see Star Wars that summer?</i>

18:39.188 --> 18:42.088
Oh, I can't... at least
1,000 times in my lifetime.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.590
Okay, so how can you still
hold any affection for it

18:44.624 --> 18:46.159
after seeing it that many times?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.827
I love it, I still
love it. I still watch it.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.528
<i>That's clockwork
orange level of torture.</i>

18:49.562 --> 18:52.700
You could sit through it if I tell you.

18:52.735 --> 18:55.505
Which movie have you seen
the most, over and over again?

18:55.539 --> 18:58.376
<i>I saw raiders of the lost ark 35 times</i>

18:58.410 --> 18:59.945
- in the movie theater.
- In the theater?

18:59.980 --> 19:01.315
My mom would drop us
off at the movie theater

19:01.349 --> 19:03.284
and I would jump five movies in a day,

19:03.318 --> 19:04.886
and they'd come pick me
up at the end of the day,

19:04.921 --> 19:08.825
and they were like, "you beat the system."

19:08.859 --> 19:11.462
There's got to be 34 other
films out there I want to see.

19:11.496 --> 19:14.298
Even a movie you didn't want to see,

19:14.333 --> 19:17.737
just to break the monotony a little.

19:17.771 --> 19:19.874
How many, like, are
these in the world right now

19:19.908 --> 19:21.310
- would you estimate?
- I'd say 15.

19:21.344 --> 19:22.978
I mean, in the world.

19:23.012 --> 19:25.314
I've actually had it
appraised from Lucasfilm.

19:25.348 --> 19:26.917
- Oh, all right.
- So you went to the top.

19:26.951 --> 19:29.052
So you already know
what it's... what it's...

19:29.086 --> 19:30.486
I know what its value is.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.654
So what are you looking to get for it?

19:31.688 --> 19:33.257
7,500.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.093
- Really?
- Yep.

19:35.128 --> 19:36.896
But that's what Lucas himself
has said, "this is probably"

19:36.930 --> 19:38.999
- "what it's worth."
- Yep.

19:39.033 --> 19:40.501
Well, it's definitely cool.

19:40.535 --> 19:43.372
I could see the stash making a play for it.

19:43.406 --> 19:44.940
What would you offer?

19:44.975 --> 19:48.008
How about 3,250?

19:48.043 --> 19:51.009
I'm thinking 55.

19:51.044 --> 19:53.945
How 'bout 35?

19:53.979 --> 19:55.714
Nah, I got to go a
little higher than that.

19:55.748 --> 20:00.556
I think I'm probably
firm at 35, considering.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.761
I don't think I could
part with it for that amount.

20:02.795 --> 20:04.631
All right, man. I understand.

20:04.666 --> 20:05.698
Get the man his noodle.

20:05.732 --> 20:07.934
All right.

20:07.968 --> 20:09.637
Definitely cool to see.

20:09.672 --> 20:11.140
I mean, you know, I've
never seen anything like it.

20:11.174 --> 20:12.873
All right, guys, well, let's see.

20:12.908 --> 20:14.576
When the new movies come out,

20:14.610 --> 20:16.078
if they're a hit, and
I'm sure they will be...

20:16.112 --> 20:17.579
I think they're gonna be. You excited?

20:17.613 --> 20:18.747
I'll be there.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.383
Both: How many times a day?

20:20.418 --> 20:21.986
- Yeah.
- Seven days a week.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.089
I've already asked
for the time off of work.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.960
- Thank you.
- One thing is for certain.

20:25.995 --> 20:28.665
There is a lot of star
wars merchandise out there.

20:28.699 --> 20:32.596
Ugh! Like, you ever
see that movie, wall-e,

20:32.631 --> 20:34.165
where the planet's just
covered with garbage?

20:34.199 --> 20:39.472
If they zoomed in on it, it would be a lot

20:39.506 --> 20:43.078
of Star Wars garbage. [Laughter]

20:43.113 --> 20:45.082
And that's all we got
for you this week, man.

20:45.116 --> 20:48.350
Just like that big old secret,
we gotta ooze out of here, man.

20:48.384 --> 20:50.019
<i>For Comic Book Men, I'm Kevin Smith.</i>

20:50.053 --> 20:51.587
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:51.622 --> 20:53.156
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:53.190 --> 20:56.027
Go, ninja. Go, ninja. Go. Good night.
