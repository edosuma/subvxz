Just not sure it's a good one.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.728
[GRUNTS]

18:46.502 --> 18:48.420
[GRUNTING]

18:49.505 --> 18:51.298
BATMAN:
Ted made the ultimate sacrifice.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.758
And in doing so...

18:52.758 --> 18:55.302
...made sure the Scarab
fell into the right hands.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.471
Your hands, Jaime.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.807
Ted didn't make it?

19:00.057 --> 19:02.476
I wasn't sure you were ready
to know about this.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.311
Our work is dangerous.

19:04.561 --> 19:08.107
And not all hero stories
have happy endings.

19:08.690 --> 19:12.111
Ted made his choice.
But now you're the Blue Beetle.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.862
What will yours be?

19:13.862 --> 19:14.822
[MACHINE WHIRRING]

19:21.912 --> 19:22.913
[BEEPING]

19:23.163 --> 19:24.957
For once, suit, we're in agreement.

19:25.833 --> 19:26.708
[GRUNTS]

19:31.588 --> 19:32.714
Oh' just great.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.716
All island-based units,
priority command...

19:34.967 --> 19:36.635
...destroy Batman and Blue Beetle.

19:39.138 --> 19:42.349
Aah! Nice throw,
but the countdown can't be stopped.

19:42.641 --> 19:46.353
And your failure
ushers in a new era for mankind--

19:48.814 --> 19:51.275
There's another way.
The armor can get me inside.

19:51.525 --> 19:53.569
I can override the safeties
on the reactor.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.737
BATMAN:
Destroy the island before the launch.

19:55.988 --> 19:58.448
Not bad. Do it.

19:58.782 --> 19:59.783
[ACTIVATING]

20:00.033 --> 20:02.870
One problem.
Getting off before the big bang.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.831
- How much time will we have?
- Yeah. We should run.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.937
Go. Don't wait for me.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.148
Oh, sure.
Let me carry the megalomaniac.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.441
My hands are free.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.374
[GRUNTS]

21:05.974 --> 21:08.435
[GRUNTS THEN GROANS]

21:27.913 --> 21:30.457
This baby came fully loaded.
Who knew?

21:30.749 --> 21:33.377
- I told you not to wait for me.
- Yeah, right.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.060
I locked Jarvis in the can.
Hope you don't have to go.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.731
Look, I'm sorry I got all hung up
on the Beetle history lesson.

21:55.023 --> 21:58.860
I wanted so badly to have been chosen
to be this hero instead of lucking into it.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.571
I guess I was an idiot
to fall for Kord's story...

22:01.822 --> 22:03.115
...about me being special.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.866
The Scarab did choose.

22:05.117 --> 22:07.911
It let you access its powers. Not Ted.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.539
But being chosen
doesn't make you a hero.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.749
What you choose does.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.087
I just wanna do the right thing.
Like Ted would've clone.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.882
BATMAN:
Spoken like a true hero.
