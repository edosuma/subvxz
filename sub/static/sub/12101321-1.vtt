You know that the
self-help industry

00:51.077 --> 00:53.211
is a $12 billion business?

00:53.245 --> 00:55.313
Televangelists are
actually making hundreds

00:55.347 --> 00:57.315
of millions of dollars
from their flock.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.218
Three million Americans
are actual cult members.

01:00.252 --> 01:02.922
That's 1% of our population.

01:02.955 --> 01:05.091
What was
the purpose of your project?

01:05.124 --> 01:07.727
If we could prevent 100 or 50

01:09.062 --> 01:12.765
or even one person from
going down this road,

01:12.799 --> 01:15.534
well, then we've done
something good here.

01:18.771 --> 01:20.673
It was a great concept.

01:20.707 --> 01:21.874
Great.

01:21.908 --> 01:24.944
We would create a larger
than life character

01:24.977 --> 01:27.279
with a unique self-help program.

01:27.312 --> 01:31.516
And then, you know, just
document the process.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.418
You
don't feel responsible

01:33.452 --> 01:34.954
for duping people?

01:36.989 --> 01:38.024
Duping?

01:38.057 --> 01:40.292
No, we were helping people.

01:43.629 --> 01:46.465
This was investigative
filmmaking.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.136
Look at this, huh?

01:50.169 --> 01:51.336
Look at Angel.

01:52.504 --> 01:55.975
You are all made
of the same energy

01:56.008 --> 02:00.079
and I pass it to you and
you pass it to the next.

02:05.651 --> 02:08.721
The original idea was
we end the documentary

02:08.755 --> 02:11.657
with this big moment
where we show the footage,

02:11.691 --> 02:13.626
all the behind the scenes stuff,

02:13.659 --> 02:16.829
let them see behind the curtain.

02:16.863 --> 02:21.600
And then they see that it
was all fake and staged.

02:21.634 --> 02:23.236
Why not
just make a documentary

02:23.268 --> 02:25.738
about fake self-help gurus?

02:25.772 --> 02:28.674
Documentaries observe
from the outside.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.945
By creating this plastic shaman,

02:32.979 --> 02:37.984
we gave people an opportunity
to peer behind the curtains

02:39.284 --> 02:41.520
to look inside the
proverbial sausage factory.

02:53.699 --> 02:54.967
No.

02:55.001 --> 02:55.802
That's
why I'm asking-

02:55.835 --> 02:57.670
Why don't we cut?

02:57.703 --> 02:58.938
Tell
slate and then cut.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.206
Tell Slate.

03:00.239 --> 03:01.373
That
was quite perfect.

03:01.406 --> 03:02.340
Perfect. Let's roll.

03:02.374 --> 03:04.110
One take three. A only. Mark.

03:07.246 --> 03:08.080
Hello.

03:09.982 --> 03:13.719
Humankind has been
infected with a mind virus.

03:15.087 --> 03:17.556
And it's coming from advertising

03:17.589 --> 03:20.993
and social media
and all this noise.

03:21.027 --> 03:25.597
So is there a way to stop
the noise and clean the mind?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.202
My name is Gordon St. Pierre,

03:29.235 --> 03:31.871
and I am the founder
of Reboot Camp.

03:31.904 --> 03:35.274
A spa for the mind
and a womb for adults.

03:36.776 --> 03:41.781
Let me take you on a journey
and be your guide to healing,

03:42.682 --> 03:44.684
by finding the light of love

03:45.852 --> 03:48.187
and being at peace together.

03:49.588 --> 03:52.992
Does this man hold the answer
to everlasting happiness?

03:53.025 --> 03:55.427
Dozens of his followers
seem to think so.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.930
Members of his Reboot Camp,

03:57.964 --> 04:00.599
which he insists is not a cult,

04:00.633 --> 04:03.836
swear that he is the new
messiah of wellbeing.

04:03.870 --> 04:06.906
To be honest, I feel like
a change has come over me.

04:06.939 --> 04:08.774
You know, the mind
can play tricks

04:08.808 --> 04:10.843
but this doesn't feel like that.

04:10.877 --> 04:11.911
This feels real.

04:11.944 --> 04:14.280
And shake it out to the left.

04:14.313 --> 04:16.381
And shake it out to the right.

04:16.414 --> 04:17.717
I feel determined

04:17.750 --> 04:21.721
and I feel like I'm
on the right path.

04:23.055 --> 04:23.923
Yes.

04:23.956 --> 04:24.891
I did. Thank you.

04:24.924 --> 04:26.726
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.694
Ja.

04:28.728 --> 04:30.196
Ja, I want you to
talk to yourself now.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.664
This is you at 14.

04:32.832 --> 04:35.134
What do you want
to tell you at 14?

04:35.167 --> 04:38.271
What the fuck are you doing?

04:38.304 --> 04:41.539
You're out here,
you're selling drugs.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.442
You're having sex
with grown women.

04:44.476 --> 04:45.645
Straighten out.

04:45.678 --> 04:47.947
Straighten up right now
before it's too late.

04:47.980 --> 04:51.083
Stop fucking and
stop selling drugs.

04:51.117 --> 04:53.518
Can I be a 14-year-old him?

04:54.687 --> 04:55.755
All right.

04:55.788 --> 04:57.622
Oh guys, this is fantastic.

04:57.657 --> 04:59.258
I see
that. I like that.

04:59.292 --> 05:00.760
- This is beautiful.
- You're good, guru.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.261
- You're good.
- I like this.

05:02.295 --> 05:03.561
You're fucking A1, man.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.563
I'm a reflection of
yourself, you know?

05:05.597 --> 05:08.401
Somehow, I just never
broke character.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.601
It's weird.

05:09.635 --> 05:12.838
Once I got into Gordon,
it's like I was him.

05:18.177 --> 05:21.847
When I was 16, my friends
and I skipped school

05:21.881 --> 05:24.850
everyday for a week
to go to the beach.

05:24.884 --> 05:28.586
When my dad found out, he
went crazy, threw me out.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.990
I've been on my own ever since.

05:31.023 --> 05:32.858
And then I met Gordon.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.696
My whole life changed.

05:38.064 --> 05:42.467
He was someone who really
led us to this path of freedom.

05:44.536 --> 05:47.940
I call this exercise,
rattle and um!

05:47.974 --> 05:49.875
Shake it. This is the rattle.

05:49.909 --> 05:52.011
And then we let it
out with a, hum!

05:52.044 --> 05:53.045
Hum!

05:56.816 --> 05:57.615
Shanti. Shanti.

06:04.023 --> 06:05.391
I love Gordon.

06:05.424 --> 06:09.095
He's truly an inspiration
to so many people.

06:11.764 --> 06:13.366
He's changed my life.

06:13.399 --> 06:15.533
The general belief is
that only weak people

06:15.567 --> 06:17.837
fall for false
profits and gurus.

06:17.870 --> 06:21.707
But in reality, almost
anyone is susceptible

06:21.741 --> 06:25.344
at the right or wrong
moment in their lives.

06:25.378 --> 06:29.048
People who've lost jobs,
families, runaways,

06:30.883 --> 06:33.551
they find themselves
seeking answers.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.054
I'm not stupid.

06:35.087 --> 06:36.022
I'm very smart.

06:36.055 --> 06:38.290
I have a college education.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.894
I just felt like
something was missing.

06:41.927 --> 06:44.096
Gordon, he had all the answers.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.032
Anita, this may be a coffin,

06:46.065 --> 06:48.868
but it is a safe coffin, okay?

06:48.901 --> 06:52.438
The problem starts with
the infection in the mind.

06:52.471 --> 06:55.207
It's the virus telling
me about the future.

06:55.241 --> 06:57.243
Right. I can't stop.
How do you stop it?

06:57.276 --> 06:59.111
- I can't stop it.
- All right.

06:59.145 --> 07:02.915
Everything that he
said made sense to me.

07:02.948 --> 07:04.116
It still does.

07:04.984 --> 07:06.052
Third time's a charm.

07:06.085 --> 07:09.021
- Okay. One more time.
- Okay.

07:10.256 --> 07:13.092
I'm gonna need another
class after this class.

07:13.125 --> 07:15.928
You don't know how I
can contact him, do you?

07:15.961 --> 07:18.030
I'm
curious about the name?

07:18.064 --> 07:19.532
- Gordon St. Pierre?
- Yeah.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.067
It had a nice ring to it.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.902
I mean, it was branding really?

07:22.935 --> 07:24.236
We were naming a product.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.104
Aha!

07:26.238 --> 07:27.973
- Matsumoto.
- Matsumoto?

07:28.007 --> 07:30.876
Think we'll get in
trouble on that one.

07:30.910 --> 07:33.312
What about St. Pierre?

07:33.345 --> 07:35.481
Gordon St. Pierre.

07:35.514 --> 07:37.049
The spiritual guide, the leader.

07:37.083 --> 07:37.950
What do you think?

07:37.983 --> 07:39.218
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.053
Except it's Gordon.

07:41.087 --> 07:43.923
- Ooh
- St. Pierre from Quebec.

07:43.956 --> 07:45.291
Seymour used to work in tech.

07:45.324 --> 07:46.992
So a lot of personal
information to use.

07:47.026 --> 07:49.495
Plus, his wife's
French-Canadian.

07:49.528 --> 07:53.265
Who has been reprogrammed
by American culture.

07:53.299 --> 07:54.567
So what does he need?

07:54.599 --> 07:55.600
He needs a new
operating system.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.002
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I love it.

07:57.036 --> 08:00.840
He needs to reboot
the operating system.

08:00.873 --> 08:02.607
- Reboot?
- Reboot.

08:02.641 --> 08:03.943
Mike, are you
gettin' this on film?

08:03.976 --> 08:06.579
- That's good.
- Because this is stuff.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.813
- Reboot.
- Yes.

08:09.782 --> 08:10.683
Hello.

08:10.716 --> 08:12.284
My name is Gordon St. Pierre.

08:12.318 --> 08:14.520
Welcome to the Reboot Camp.

08:16.489 --> 08:20.192
If that's not a guru,
I don't know what is.

08:21.694 --> 08:22.828
I'm gonna work on the accent.

08:22.862 --> 08:24.797
- But yeah.
- a little bit.

08:24.830 --> 08:28.100
See my family, is.

08:28.134 --> 08:30.803
I want to tell
you a story, okay?

08:30.836 --> 08:35.107
It was a time I was playing
with my three-year-old nephew

08:35.141 --> 08:39.211
and I realized he was
closer to bliss than I was.

08:40.346 --> 08:43.015
In fact, I am contaminating him.

08:45.751 --> 08:47.720
So I go to the outback.

08:47.753 --> 08:49.989
You went to the steakhouse?

08:50.022 --> 08:51.690
Not the steakhouse, John.

08:51.724 --> 08:56.729
The Australia, and I
study with the Aborigine

08:57.997 --> 09:01.734
and they teach me how
to fix the hardware

09:01.767 --> 09:05.004
by reinstalling the software.

09:06.772 --> 09:09.842
This is the gift they give me

09:09.875 --> 09:12.244
and I bring this gift to you.

09:13.412 --> 09:15.347
Are you ready to
receive this gift?

09:17.049 --> 09:18.017
Nay or yay?

09:18.884 --> 09:20.386
Yay!

09:20.419 --> 09:21.921
Are we ready to
do whatever it take

09:21.954 --> 09:24.990
no matter how crazy
or stupid or bizarre?

09:25.024 --> 09:25.925
Nay or yay?

09:27.026 --> 09:28.260
Yay!

09:28.294 --> 09:29.428
Then let's reboot.

09:29.461 --> 09:32.164
Come on! Let's reboot.

09:32.198 --> 09:34.033
Gordon was a trip.

09:34.066 --> 09:37.903
He had this four-step
program or was it five?

09:37.937 --> 09:39.572
I'm really bad with numbers.

09:39.605 --> 09:42.575
Step one was all about getting off.
You know?

09:43.643 --> 09:45.411
No.

09:45.444 --> 09:48.080
Like switching everything off.

09:48.948 --> 09:52.851
No, no, no.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.054
I can't do the small spaces.

09:55.087 --> 09:55.921
I can't. I can't.

09:55.955 --> 09:56.755
Lisa, you're okay?

09:56.789 --> 09:58.023
Hello. Hello.

09:58.057 --> 09:59.525
I'm fine. It was
very pink in there.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.961
- Eric, how you feel though?
- I can't do the small spaces.

10:01.994 --> 10:04.230
Okay, but now you
appreciate life, huh?

10:04.263 --> 10:06.031
- You see?
- I do feel alive.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.701
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.934
It's good.

10:08.968 --> 10:11.070
And then step two
was all like talking.

10:11.103 --> 10:12.972
Or wait. No, no, no, no.

10:13.005 --> 10:13.939
That was step three.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.075
Step two was group activities.

10:16.108 --> 10:20.813
The second stage of the
psychosexual development

10:20.846 --> 10:22.448
is the anal stage.

10:22.481 --> 10:26.452
We have been programmed
since children to keep it in,

10:26.485 --> 10:27.920
to be retentive.

10:27.953 --> 10:29.922
We don't show how we feel.

10:29.955 --> 10:31.490
We don't show love.

10:32.659 --> 10:35.127
We are programmed not
to show these things

10:35.160 --> 10:36.929
and keep it inside,
but where do we go?

10:36.962 --> 10:38.163
There's no room.

10:38.197 --> 10:40.599
It take up the heart,
it take up the stomach

10:40.634 --> 10:43.569
and it take up the
head, the brain.

10:43.602 --> 10:46.105
So today, we're going
to dump the virus

10:46.138 --> 10:48.173
and the malware into the toilet.

10:48.207 --> 10:49.743
Dump into the toilet.

10:49.775 --> 10:50.744
Hey, hey, hey.

10:51.678 --> 10:52.511
No, no, no.

10:52.544 --> 10:53.747
It's a figurative dump.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.247
- Don't...
- Of course, not really.

10:55.281 --> 10:57.449
Don't take the dump
in the toilet. My God.

10:57.483 --> 10:58.917
I think that one
guy took it literally

10:58.951 --> 11:00.419
and actually pooped.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.756
My wife convinced me to
go to one of the events.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.189
When I saw the guy in
the skirt and sandals,

11:04.223 --> 11:05.858
I knew he was a fraud.

11:05.891 --> 11:07.192
Gordon was very nice.

11:07.226 --> 11:09.361
And what he had to say
made a lot of sense.

11:09.395 --> 11:11.063
We are all infected.

11:12.364 --> 11:13.667
Yeah.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.101
Was
the Reboot Camp a cult?

11:16.135 --> 11:18.772
The Reboot Camp was not
a cult when I was there.

11:18.804 --> 11:19.805
Did you have rules

11:19.838 --> 11:21.106
about what was acceptable,

11:21.140 --> 11:23.509
about lines you wouldn't cross?

11:23.542 --> 11:24.977
Absolutely.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.179
We would not separate
people from their families

11:27.212 --> 11:29.281
and we wouldn't take
money from anyone.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.616
Several people claim

11:30.650 --> 11:33.552
they gave money to the camp.

11:33.585 --> 11:36.221
Well, I never asked
anyone for money.

11:36.255 --> 11:37.523
The whole purpose
of this was to show

11:37.556 --> 11:39.659
the mechanics of the con.

11:39.693 --> 11:40.794
That's it.

11:45.732 --> 11:49.703
The term cult gets thrown
around a lot in pop culture.

11:49.736 --> 11:53.005
But a cult is not just
a close knit group.

11:53.038 --> 11:56.676
Many organizations have
cult-like elements.

11:56.710 --> 12:00.546
A sense of belonging, the
inclusiveness, certain rules,

12:00.579 --> 12:04.684
but that's any athletic club
or military organization.

12:04.718 --> 12:07.986
One of the things that
make cults, cults,

12:08.020 --> 12:10.189
is that they have a
charismatic leader

12:10.222 --> 12:12.692
who claims to have
all the answers.

12:12.726 --> 12:16.629
We have another kind
of noise that is louder.

12:18.297 --> 12:20.834
The noise in my head.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.267
What should I be?

12:22.301 --> 12:24.403
Who should I be?

12:24.436 --> 12:27.306
And the big question,
what is my...

12:32.111 --> 12:33.278
Purpose?

12:33.312 --> 12:34.913
What is my purpose?

12:35.749 --> 12:37.483
Now, my great ability

12:38.917 --> 12:43.222
may be a gift from God,
from Buddha, from the light,

12:43.255 --> 12:47.126
is to take these
complex question of life

12:47.159 --> 12:49.328
and simplify them for you.

12:50.630 --> 12:54.032
Yes.

12:54.066 --> 12:57.771
I was in a cult
when I was a teen.

12:57.804 --> 12:59.873
Reboot Camp wasn't a cult.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.241
It was freaking Disneyland.

13:02.274 --> 13:04.376
Cults are supposed to
be dark and controlling,

13:04.410 --> 13:07.212
but Reboot Camp was
nothing like that.

13:07.246 --> 13:09.649
Freestyle means you
do whatever you want.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.819
You want to be a chicken,
you're a chicken.

13:12.852 --> 13:14.654
You want to fly, you fly.

13:14.687 --> 13:17.089
Whoever you are, take it.

13:17.122 --> 13:19.625
I'm feeling the
movements of the earth.

13:19.659 --> 13:20.559
The rhythm.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.594
The rhythm of the earth.

13:24.596 --> 13:28.500
- Go, Anita.
- I always wanted to do this.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.838
- Ribbon dancing.
- Yes, the ribbon.

13:31.871 --> 13:33.807
With your own
stuff right there.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.175
Now, I understand how all
of these reality shows work,

13:36.208 --> 13:38.110
because that was one
of our big worries.

13:38.143 --> 13:39.578
Like, what's gonna happen
with these cameras?

13:39.611 --> 13:40.914
What are people gonna say?

13:40.946 --> 13:42.347
Nobody had an issue.

13:42.381 --> 13:45.551
We jump and we love
and we take it in.

13:46.385 --> 13:47.754
Excellent.

13:52.191 --> 13:54.493
So love bombing is basically
overwhelming new recruits

13:54.526 --> 13:56.094
with attention, praise and love.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.931
That's the early phase
right when they join.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.836
So happy you invited me.

14:02.869 --> 14:05.204
I'm so happy you're
here, love and light.

14:05.237 --> 14:08.875
You know, usually I wait
to do this with a camper,

14:08.908 --> 14:11.310
but you, I want to
try something, okay?

14:11.343 --> 14:12.478
- Yeah, anything.
- It's okay?

14:12.511 --> 14:13.713
Uh-huh.

14:13.746 --> 14:15.214
I want to bring
in another camper

14:15.247 --> 14:17.149
and have you teach him.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.284
Do you think I'm ready?

14:19.318 --> 14:21.053
You are ready, my love.

14:21.086 --> 14:21.888
Really? Okay.

14:22.755 --> 14:24.189
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:24.223 --> 14:25.390
Hello, John.

14:25.424 --> 14:27.025
This is Maisey.

14:27.059 --> 14:28.227
Maisey, this is John.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.228
Hi, John.

14:29.261 --> 14:30.864
Maisey.

14:30.897 --> 14:33.565
Tell John that he is loved.

14:33.599 --> 14:35.434
John, you are loved.

14:36.568 --> 14:40.038
John, tell Maisey
that you feel the love.

14:41.373 --> 14:43.509
Maisey, I feel the love.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.043
Excellent.

14:45.077 --> 14:47.246
Now, Maisey, tell John you
want to give him the love.

14:47.279 --> 14:48.514
Come on. Tell him.

14:48.547 --> 14:50.482
John, I wanna
give you the love.

14:50.516 --> 14:51.718
Yes, give him the love.

14:51.751 --> 14:53.018
Give him the love.

14:53.051 --> 14:55.187
Yes. Give him the love.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.990
It's so good.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.157
Okay. I'm really not
comfortable with this.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.592
Oh, take the love, John.

15:00.627 --> 15:01.861
Take it.

15:01.895 --> 15:03.061
- Just feel it, John.
- It's good love.

15:03.095 --> 15:04.530
This was good for John.

15:04.563 --> 15:05.999
It loosened him right up.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.199
The guy had an erection.

15:07.232 --> 15:08.433
Stop it.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.502
Not everyone walks
around with a boner.

15:10.536 --> 15:13.006
Gordon made
everyone feel loved.

15:13.038 --> 15:14.674
Yeah, I felt the
love, all right.

15:14.707 --> 15:17.109
We love Jimmy, we love
Jimmy, we love Jimmy.

15:19.244 --> 15:20.112
Love.

15:20.145 --> 15:21.079
Love.

15:21.113 --> 15:22.180
Love.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.081
Love.

15:23.115 --> 15:23.950
Love.

15:23.983 --> 15:24.918
Love.

15:24.951 --> 15:25.785
Love.

15:25.818 --> 15:26.653
Love.

15:27.787 --> 15:29.354
I don't care who you are.

15:29.388 --> 15:32.224
Two dozen people hugging you,
telling you they love you,

15:32.257 --> 15:35.527
showering you with
affection over and over.

15:35.561 --> 15:38.063
It is supremely powerful.

15:38.096 --> 15:39.699
My dad was a preacher.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.901
He loved his congregation.

15:42.802 --> 15:45.404
But at home he was cold as ice.

15:47.472 --> 15:52.477
And whenever my mom would
show me any sign of affection,

15:53.913 --> 15:56.114
he'd yell at her and tell her
that she was making me weak.

15:56.148 --> 15:57.416
Why you treat him like that?

15:57.449 --> 15:59.752
You're gonna make him gay.

15:59.786 --> 16:02.321
I guess the joke's on you, dad.

16:03.823 --> 16:07.827
At Reboot Camp, everyone
was just so nice.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.062
Jimmy!

16:09.094 --> 16:10.429
Jimmy!

16:10.462 --> 16:11.798
Jimmy!

16:11.831 --> 16:13.098
Jimmy!

16:13.131 --> 16:13.967
Jimmy!

16:15.467 --> 16:19.271
Everyone genuinely cared
and Gordon encouraged it.

16:19.304 --> 16:21.273
This is your family.

16:21.306 --> 16:24.142
This is people who love you.

16:24.176 --> 16:28.081
I've never really
had a family before.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.849
You have a family
now, man, come on.

16:29.882 --> 16:31.350
Come on. You gotta get out.

16:33.518 --> 16:34.519
It's like a drug.

16:34.553 --> 16:35.989
You want more.

16:36.022 --> 16:37.422
You want more.

16:37.456 --> 16:41.426
And so you stick around
because now you've been primed

16:41.460 --> 16:43.328
to receive the gospel.

16:43.362 --> 16:45.665
Because this guy
has all the answers.

16:45.698 --> 16:48.668
Because, look at
how good you feel.

16:50.069 --> 16:51.838
<i>♪ Why would you look
outside yourself ♪</i>

16:51.871 --> 16:55.041
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

16:55.074 --> 16:57.977
<i>♪ All of the world inside ♪</i>

16:58.011 --> 16:59.611
<i>♪ One, two, three, four ♪</i>

16:59.646 --> 17:01.146
Release the feathers.

17:01.179 --> 17:05.685
Take the feathers and thrust
the feathers to the gang.

17:07.519 --> 17:10.522
Now, try to catch the
feathers, try to catch them.

17:10.555 --> 17:12.125
Can you catch them?

17:12.157 --> 17:13.291
No, you can't, right?

17:13.325 --> 17:15.227
- No.
- This is the same thing

17:15.260 --> 17:17.329
with the mind virus, guys.

17:17.362 --> 17:19.197
You cannot stop the infection.

17:19.231 --> 17:20.667
You are infected.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.136
The first time he
called us no bots,

17:23.168 --> 17:24.971
I thought I misheard.

17:25.004 --> 17:26.739
But then he kept
using the phrase,

17:26.773 --> 17:28.573
and, I don't know, I liked it.

17:28.607 --> 17:29.909
You know, it made
me feel special.

17:29.942 --> 17:32.045
'cause we weren't robots.

17:32.078 --> 17:33.412
We were no bots.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.684
I have two friends
here I want you to meet.

17:37.717 --> 17:39.719
We have Henry. Hello, Henry.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.087
And the beautiful, Chantal.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.689
Ooh, la, la. Okay.

17:44.556 --> 17:47.160
So the thing about
Henry and Chantal

17:47.192 --> 17:51.329
that they're very good at is
they can look at each other

17:51.363 --> 17:52.832
and they don't talk.

17:52.865 --> 17:55.001
The virus come from the noise.

17:55.034 --> 17:57.602
The mind viruses,
the noise is coming,

17:57.637 --> 17:58.771
it's coming, it's coming.

17:58.805 --> 18:00.605
We're going to take it out.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.541
Bobby, excellent.

18:05.978 --> 18:09.414
We're going on a 24-hour,
we're diet everyone.

18:09.448 --> 18:10.717
You know, you have
the food diet,

18:10.750 --> 18:11.583
you don't eat.

18:11.616 --> 18:13.251
This is you don't talk.

18:13.285 --> 18:14.120
Shh!

18:16.155 --> 18:17.556
Excellent, my no bots.

18:17.589 --> 18:19.192
You are fantastic.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.193
I have a question.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.060
Shh!

18:22.427 --> 18:24.396
I went up to him, I
said, "Look, I'm a talker.

18:24.429 --> 18:25.564
That's just what I do.

18:25.597 --> 18:28.366
And not talking is
just not gonna cut it."

18:28.400 --> 18:29.301
He laughed.

18:30.737 --> 18:32.370
He said it was especially
important for me.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.141
So he challenged me
to do it for 48 hours.

18:35.174 --> 18:37.476
I lasted 40 minutes.

18:37.509 --> 18:38.911
This is good, my no bots.

18:38.945 --> 18:39.879
This is excellent.

18:39.912 --> 18:41.246
Take in the sun.

18:42.514 --> 18:44.751
Don't worry about the blower.

18:44.784 --> 18:46.485
Gordon had all these
interesting terms.

18:46.518 --> 18:47.887
Huh?

18:51.023 --> 18:52.058
We make up the word.

18:52.091 --> 18:53.458
Oh, okay.

18:53.492 --> 18:56.394
So it's a new way of
communication, okay?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.169
Like that?

19:05.537 --> 19:08.607
John, what is she
telling you with that word?

19:08.641 --> 19:09.842
Be quiet.

19:09.876 --> 19:11.443
I felt more at
peace with myself.

19:11.476 --> 19:12.912
That was all a
lot of fluff for me.

19:12.945 --> 19:15.014
She was finally
happy, so I was happy.

19:15.047 --> 19:17.349
when
you say finally happy...

19:17.382 --> 19:18.918
Well, there was infidelity.

19:18.951 --> 19:20.119
We don't need
to get into that.

19:20.153 --> 19:22.755
Well, I had an affair
with the dry cleaner.

19:22.789 --> 19:23.823
She caught the yellow fever.

19:23.856 --> 19:24.690
Stop.

19:24.724 --> 19:26.025
You can't say that.

19:26.058 --> 19:26.959
That is racist.

19:26.993 --> 19:29.662
Sure I can. He was Korean.

19:29.695 --> 19:31.831
You should probably go on
another word diet, you know?

19:31.864 --> 19:33.199
Okay? All right.

19:35.668 --> 19:39.205
Our whole belief system
was in turning off noise.

19:39.238 --> 19:43.142
And cleaning ourselves
of these inner viruses.

19:43.176 --> 19:46.478
And we did this through
all kinds of exercises,

19:46.511 --> 19:49.447
mostly outdoor
activities like yoga.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.685
Louder, louder.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.324
Moving on into
the elephant tusk.

19:59.357 --> 20:02.929
Take a deep breath in,
take your tusks out.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.403
Oh, it's a good elephant.

20:11.436 --> 20:12.839
Good elephant, Lilian.

20:12.872 --> 20:14.707
And we're gonna squat down.

20:14.740 --> 20:17.677
We are going to
use our root chakra

20:18.845 --> 20:22.215
with a little bit
of a pelvic thrust.

20:22.248 --> 20:23.348
Come on, everyone.

20:31.858 --> 20:33.326
Well, you know
what he got me into.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.062
He got me back in
my driving lust

20:36.963 --> 20:38.831
I have for my wife.

20:38.865 --> 20:40.867
Two cows having
sex in the woods.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.834
It's okay.

20:41.868 --> 20:42.668
Okay, she can't hear.

20:42.702 --> 20:43.836
Okay?

20:43.870 --> 20:45.238
That's the only
complaint I really have.

20:45.271 --> 20:48.207
It's the fact she's sleeping
with my best friend.

20:48.241 --> 20:50.142
Besides that, I'm fine.

20:52.912 --> 20:54.947
I'm not really fine.

20:54.981 --> 20:56.782
- Eric.
- Yes.

20:56.816 --> 20:59.051
Breathe with me. Come on.

21:01.954 --> 21:05.390
The first word you want
to say to let out is what?

21:05.423 --> 21:06.292
Shit!

21:06.325 --> 21:07.860
- Say it again.
- Shit!

21:07.894 --> 21:10.930
- One more time, louder.
- Shit!

21:10.963 --> 21:12.198
This thing about reconnect,

21:12.231 --> 21:14.066
I didn't even know
we were disconnected.

21:18.938 --> 21:20.405
He made us draw these.

21:20.438 --> 21:23.075
He said our drawings help
us identify our viruses.

21:23.109 --> 21:24.977
I told him that crap
didn't work for me.

21:25.011 --> 21:26.913
He told us the best
was yet to come.

21:26.946 --> 21:29.447
Did he
specify what the best was?

21:29.481 --> 21:31.616
He called it the
rebooted bliss.

21:31.651 --> 21:33.653
Success, love, money,

21:33.686 --> 21:35.087
a deeper understanding of life,

21:35.121 --> 21:36.322
a sense of purpose.

21:36.355 --> 21:38.157
Every guru has a
different promise.

21:38.190 --> 21:39.792
Ours was the bliss.

21:40.993 --> 21:43.428
The bliss is just
around the corner.

21:43.461 --> 21:45.631
If you could just
wait a little longer,

21:45.665 --> 21:47.733
then the clouds will break open

21:47.767 --> 21:50.169
and the bliss will
rain down upon you

21:50.202 --> 21:52.071
and you'll prove all
the naysayers wrong

21:52.104 --> 21:55.308
as you lead this life of bliss.

21:55.341 --> 21:57.442
If you could just be
a little more patient.

21:57.475 --> 21:58.610
That's what my wife
used to tell me.

21:58.644 --> 22:01.080
Just be a little more patient.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.684
That and to visualize
my intentions.

22:04.717 --> 22:06.852
What she didn't visualize
was the divorce.

22:06.886 --> 22:09.021
Seymour wasn't like the
other boys I grew up with.

22:09.055 --> 22:11.357
He was deeper, more intense.

22:13.826 --> 22:15.828
I was instantly
attracted to him.

22:15.861 --> 22:17.797
He got a job in Silicon Valley

22:17.830 --> 22:21.701
and I became a housewife
straight out of college.

22:21.734 --> 22:24.804
One day, Seymour told
me that his company

22:24.837 --> 22:27.974
was paying for a
self-improvement seminar

22:28.007 --> 22:29.809
and that spouses were welcome.

22:29.842 --> 22:32.411
So I went out of sheer boredom.

22:33.879 --> 22:35.014
At first, I thought
it was gonna be

22:35.047 --> 22:37.717
this new age, hippy mumbo jumbo,

22:39.852 --> 22:42.487
but I actually loved it.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.790
I was just happy she
had something to do.

22:44.824 --> 22:47.193
'cause I was working
all the time.

22:47.226 --> 22:49.028
Crazy hours, weekends.

22:50.196 --> 22:52.465
It was very action-oriented.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.634
We had assignments
and I was hooked.

22:55.668 --> 22:58.337
I think paying
for these seminars

22:58.371 --> 23:01.240
lessened the guilt of
just not being around.

23:01.273 --> 23:03.209
I was addicted.

23:03.242 --> 23:05.543
I must've taken 100 seminars.

23:05.577 --> 23:08.814
And she never put what she
learned into practice. Right?

23:08.848 --> 23:12.485
Because she was almost
there, almost ready,

23:12.517 --> 23:16.389
but needed one more class or
like this ultimate retreat.

23:16.422 --> 23:18.257
That would be it.

23:18.290 --> 23:19.825
I saw all of them.

23:19.859 --> 23:22.594
The local guys, the
Robbins, Chopra.

23:22.628 --> 23:25.831
And I had no idea what
these gurus were charging.

23:25.865 --> 23:26.665
Do you know...

23:26.699 --> 23:27.900
Like, okay.

23:27.933 --> 23:30.503
Like a two day seminar
could be two or $3,000.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.106
Some of these retreats were
in the tens of thousands.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.075
And then one day I came back

23:36.108 --> 23:39.045
from a spiritual
retreat in Brazil

23:39.078 --> 23:42.381
and there was a bank statement
on the kitchen table.

23:42.415 --> 23:45.617
So Grace blew
through all our money,

23:45.651 --> 23:48.054
our retirement fund,

23:48.087 --> 23:51.524
and accumulated over 90
grand in credit card debt.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.893
I had spent over $300,000.

23:56.095 --> 23:59.732
And here we were worse off
than when we graduated college.

23:59.765 --> 24:01.867
Seymour shut down completely.

24:01.901 --> 24:04.470
And it wasn't even the money.

24:06.505 --> 24:08.307
I just felt betrayed.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.241
It was 10:00 p.m.

24:09.275 --> 24:10.709
I'm already sleeping

24:10.743 --> 24:12.812
'cause I have an early
call time the next morning.

24:12.845 --> 24:14.880
There's a knock on my door.

24:14.914 --> 24:16.248
It's my brother.

24:16.282 --> 24:18.818
Seymour just disappeared.

24:18.851 --> 24:20.319
Gone.

24:20.352 --> 24:22.354
Didn't show up for work.

24:23.255 --> 24:24.657
I waited and waited.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.425
I didn't hear a peep.

24:26.459 --> 24:27.625
A week turns into a month.

24:27.660 --> 24:30.162
And before you knew
it, we were roommates.

24:31.163 --> 24:32.331
I didn't know what to do.

24:32.364 --> 24:34.100
So I called my coach.

24:38.003 --> 24:40.306
He was really helpful.

24:40.339 --> 24:41.774
So Danny helped me out.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.676
He got me some extra work
on these commercials.

24:43.709 --> 24:46.779
And somehow that segued into
me doing voiceover work.

24:46.812 --> 24:48.447
I'm in the recording
studio one day

24:48.481 --> 24:52.418
and I bump into this
old college buddy.

24:52.451 --> 24:55.554
And he tells me he
bumped into Grace,

24:56.621 --> 24:58.190
with a guy.

24:58.224 --> 25:01.160
Apparently, she started
seeing her self-help coach.

25:01.193 --> 25:03.329
Seymour is a calm guy.

25:03.362 --> 25:07.500
This, I had never
seen him so mad.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.669
She sided with the enemy.

25:10.703 --> 25:12.505
Can I get an amen?

25:12.538 --> 25:14.507
Danny and I booked this gig

25:14.540 --> 25:17.176
doing a promo for
this televangelist.

25:17.209 --> 25:19.111
Yes. Can I get an amen?

25:19.145 --> 25:20.779
Thank you, Jesus. Whoa!

25:20.813 --> 25:23.983
The preacher was a
perfect con artist.

25:24.016 --> 25:26.285
Suave and sleazy,
but condescending.

25:26.318 --> 25:29.655
If planes had existed
when Jesus was around,

25:29.688 --> 25:32.124
he would have flown from
Bethlehem to Nazareth

25:32.158 --> 25:33.893
and all over Galilee.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.696
People have dreams.

25:37.730 --> 25:41.567
I have a dream and my
dream is to touch my flock

25:41.600 --> 25:43.068
as often as possible.

25:43.102 --> 25:47.072
And this here aeroplane
helps me do that.

25:47.106 --> 25:49.275
This, this is God's plane.

25:50.743 --> 25:53.312
After the shoot from hell,

25:53.345 --> 25:56.482
Danny and I go out for
drinks with the crew.

25:56.515 --> 25:57.316
And voila.

25:58.551 --> 26:01.720
The idea for the
Reboot Camp was born.

26:15.301 --> 26:19.371
We change keys to

26:19.405 --> 26:21.173
You know, most people,
they try to life.

26:21.207 --> 26:24.610
They wake up one day,
oh, I'm in a nightmare.

26:24.644 --> 26:26.378
I don't know what I need.

26:26.412 --> 26:29.181
- I think I'm in a nightmare and I don't know what I need.
- A-Ha!

26:29.215 --> 26:31.784
Last week I got
fired from my job.

26:31.817 --> 26:36.822
I came home early from work
and I find my girlfriend

26:37.990 --> 26:39.358
in the tub with our
neighbor, Laryssa.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.426
Oh!

26:40.459 --> 26:41.727
They were drinking margaritas

26:41.760 --> 26:44.029
in the middle of
the day for lunch.

26:44.063 --> 26:48.968
I was in such a state I
forgot to put my car into park

26:49.001 --> 26:52.071
and it rolled into the
garage, crashed into the shelf

26:52.104 --> 26:55.541
and killed my boa constrictor,
little Herbie junior.

26:55.574 --> 26:56.375
No.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.309
Yeah.

26:57.343 --> 26:58.577
And I didn't know what to do.

26:58.611 --> 27:02.481
So, I understand you
blame the neighbor.

27:02.514 --> 27:06.452
I guess I blame
Marissa, my girlfriend.

27:06.485 --> 27:07.654
Both of 'em.

27:07.687 --> 27:10.789
Laryssa, is the girlfriend?

27:10.823 --> 27:12.324
No. Marissa is the girlfriend.

27:12.358 --> 27:13.425
Marissa?

27:13.459 --> 27:14.460
- Yeah.
- Is the girlfriend?

27:14.493 --> 27:15.327
Yes.

27:16.929 --> 27:17.997
Of Laryssa?

27:21.133 --> 27:25.337
Well, she said no, but
I think maybe she's lying.

27:26.772 --> 27:28.941
We're going to do an
exercise outside together.

27:28.974 --> 27:29.942
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:29.975 --> 27:31.143
We're going to fix it, okay.

27:31.176 --> 27:32.278
- We are?
- Yes, we're going to fix it.

27:32.311 --> 27:33.245
Okay.

27:33.279 --> 27:35.281
People responded to Seymour.

27:35.314 --> 27:37.249
They worshiped him.

27:37.283 --> 27:39.485
It didn't matter
what he said or did,

27:39.518 --> 27:40.953
they just lapped it all up.

27:40.986 --> 27:43.155
We're going to put
you back in the womb

27:43.188 --> 27:45.624
to the moment you come
through the placenta

27:45.659 --> 27:47.694
and you will be in bliss.

27:47.727 --> 27:48.994
- We're wrapping him up.
- Okay, Johnny.

27:49.028 --> 27:50.296
Let's put him on the ground.

27:50.329 --> 27:51.463
Let's go, guys.

27:51.497 --> 27:52.298
We're gonna put it down.

28:06.378 --> 28:09.148
Reboot Camp is
fucking awesome.

28:11.216 --> 28:12.851
It's pretty amazing actually.

28:12.885 --> 28:15.988
Sometimes, he didn't
even say anything.

28:16.021 --> 28:17.489
Gordon,

28:17.523 --> 28:21.327
will you please tell
her how the world works?

28:21.360 --> 28:22.328
Look at her.

28:22.361 --> 28:23.797
She's beautiful.

28:23.829 --> 28:28.133
But with the right breasts,
she'd be unstoppable.

28:28.167 --> 28:30.069
I'm not getting implants, mom.

28:30.102 --> 28:31.805
I don't need a rich
asshole to support me.

28:31.837 --> 28:35.709
Hey, it's your father
you're talking about.

28:35.742 --> 28:36.743
I can't get through to her.

28:36.776 --> 28:37.744
Hopefully you can help me.

28:37.777 --> 28:39.511
No, leave him out of it.

28:39.545 --> 28:41.213
No, he's here to help us.

28:41.246 --> 28:43.415
You're worth more
than your boobs.

28:43.449 --> 28:46.185
What about butt cheeks?

28:46.218 --> 28:47.754
The guy solved
people's problems

28:47.787 --> 28:49.888
without even uttering a word.

28:49.922 --> 28:51.090
My God, mom.

28:51.123 --> 28:52.524
Just get it right.

28:52.558 --> 28:55.361
It drove her crazy that Gordon
wasn't interested in her

28:55.394 --> 28:57.062
or her boobs.

28:57.096 --> 29:00.399
If he was such a saint,
why did he get you these?

29:00.432 --> 29:03.335
Because he was
proving a point.

29:03.369 --> 29:05.772
I mean, I look like Nicki Minaj.

29:05.805 --> 29:07.005
You do not.

29:07.039 --> 29:08.607
You look like Barbie.

29:08.641 --> 29:10.409
I looked ridiculous.

29:10.442 --> 29:12.211
You know, I
actually knew from the beginning

29:12.244 --> 29:13.445
that he was a fake.

29:13.479 --> 29:15.013
I knew it.

29:15.047 --> 29:18.417
This whole project is about
fakeness and fake people, mom.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.919
It's a pretty powerful message

29:20.953 --> 29:22.121
if you get it.

29:23.790 --> 29:25.624
Can I just add a note here?

29:25.658 --> 29:28.427
I do feel like I got
a lot out of this.

29:28.460 --> 29:29.261
What'd you get?

29:29.294 --> 29:31.029
High with Ja Rule?

29:31.063 --> 29:34.066
Yeah, but that's not
what I was talking about.

29:34.099 --> 29:37.436
I mean that, I don't think you
need to get implants at all.

29:40.906 --> 29:41.907
Are you serious?

29:41.940 --> 29:42.776
Yes.

29:42.809 --> 29:43.976
Thank you, mom.

29:44.009 --> 29:46.378
- I love you.
- I love you too.

29:46.412 --> 29:48.213
I think you're
perfect the way you are.

29:48.247 --> 29:53.252
And even with your implants,
I think you're perfect, too.

29:53.820 --> 29:54.754
Just a little more perfect.

29:57.423 --> 30:00.592
What's funny is our
teachings actually worked.

30:00.626 --> 30:02.662
Word got out, people
just started showing up.

30:02.695 --> 30:05.765
Now we see that with heart,

30:05.799 --> 30:07.667
I take it and I dip it.

30:09.168 --> 30:10.002
Hello.

30:11.336 --> 30:12.938
This is Keith. I'm Ysabel.

30:12.971 --> 30:14.573
This is my fiancé.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.575
He's got multiple phobias.

30:16.608 --> 30:17.911
No. No, I don't.

30:17.943 --> 30:18.845
I don't.

30:18.878 --> 30:20.179
He has got Eurotophobia.

30:20.212 --> 30:21.648
Fear of vagina.

30:21.681 --> 30:23.482
- Okay. That's fine.
- Kayla maybe some privacy,

30:23.515 --> 30:25.852
and I talk to you
later, love and light.

30:25.885 --> 30:26.686
Hey, love and light.

30:26.719 --> 30:27.519
What is that?

30:27.553 --> 30:28.822
Why is there a camera?

30:28.855 --> 30:32.291
We are recording so
we may see the growth

30:32.324 --> 30:34.326
and then play it
back to teach you.

30:34.359 --> 30:35.961
- Great. Fine.
- Exactly.

30:35.994 --> 30:38.430
You know, we were supposed
to get married last year

30:38.464 --> 30:39.933
and three months
before the wedding,

30:39.965 --> 30:41.701
he developed all these phobias.

30:41.734 --> 30:44.503
Okay. Tell me
about the phobia.

30:44.536 --> 30:45.971
It's phobiae.

30:46.004 --> 30:47.473
Pardon?

30:47.506 --> 30:51.210
The plural of phobia
is not phobias or phobia.

30:51.243 --> 30:52.712
- Not phobias.
- It's phobiae.

30:52.745 --> 30:53.680
- Phobiae?
- Say it with me.

30:53.713 --> 30:54.613
You're French. Okay.

30:54.647 --> 30:56.014
- Phobiae.
- Phobiae, hey.

30:56.048 --> 30:57.316
- Phobiae.
- That's it.

30:57.349 --> 31:00.219
- Yeah, okay.
- Just get it right.

31:00.252 --> 31:02.054
Some healer.

31:02.087 --> 31:03.890
He's been in a wheelchair
for three months.

31:03.923 --> 31:05.825
- He's afraid of walking.
- I'm not.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.161
I don't understand why,

31:09.194 --> 31:10.630
and ask him how long it's
been since we've had sex.

31:10.663 --> 31:11.865
Okay, how long
has it been since-

31:11.898 --> 31:13.065
- Nine months.
- Nine months.

31:13.098 --> 31:14.868
- That's how long.
- That's okay.

31:14.901 --> 31:17.637
- No. It's not okay.
- No. Not okay.

31:17.670 --> 31:19.238
- It's okay.
- Nine weeks maybe.

31:19.271 --> 31:20.874
But I'm just saying it's...

31:20.907 --> 31:22.207
Yeah, and that's not okay.

31:22.241 --> 31:25.143
His teachings were eccentric.

31:25.177 --> 31:26.545
Everybody knew that though.

31:26.578 --> 31:28.480
Everybody knew his
teachings were eccentric.

31:28.514 --> 31:30.015
I think the important
thing to focus on

31:30.048 --> 31:31.885
is the fact that it works.

31:31.918 --> 31:34.219
Come on. One, two, three.

31:34.253 --> 31:35.087
Go, go.

31:36.923 --> 31:38.156
Excellent. Okay.

31:38.190 --> 31:40.025
Are you okay?

31:40.058 --> 31:40.994
Very good.

31:41.026 --> 31:43.028
Keith is already in Shavasana.

31:43.061 --> 31:44.029
It's a good pose.

31:44.062 --> 31:45.698
It's a meditative pose.

31:45.732 --> 31:47.734
We're going to
find him in cobra.

31:47.767 --> 31:48.935
Come on with me, Isabel.

31:48.968 --> 31:51.036
Feet together, toes
together and up.

31:51.069 --> 31:53.006
Through the light.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.908
Exhale through the heart center.

31:54.941 --> 31:57.576
We wing over, bend down.

31:57.609 --> 31:58.510
Excellent.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.112
Push up.

32:00.145 --> 32:01.748
Now, he's peaceful.

32:01.781 --> 32:02.614
Shh.

32:03.883 --> 32:06.051
Let the peace and love in.

32:08.988 --> 32:10.355
Fuck shit, motherfucker.

32:10.389 --> 32:12.257
Fuck, cocksucker. Fuck!

32:13.927 --> 32:14.794
Oh, that felt good.

32:14.827 --> 32:15.762
That's good.

32:15.795 --> 32:17.062
Try that.

32:17.095 --> 32:18.463
You go.

32:18.497 --> 32:21.701
Motherfucker, cocksucker,
shit balls and vagina.

32:21.734 --> 32:22.869
Excellent, Ysabel.

32:22.902 --> 32:24.469
Excellent. Keith, you go.

32:24.503 --> 32:25.939
No.

32:25.972 --> 32:27.439
I'm not doing this fucking shit.

32:27.472 --> 32:28.908
It's fucking stupid.

32:28.942 --> 32:31.076
Hey, it actually
feels really great.

32:31.109 --> 32:32.244
- No.
- Okay, Keith.

32:32.277 --> 32:33.211
We have to have a talk.

32:33.245 --> 32:34.413
What?

32:34.446 --> 32:35.748
Listen, there are
two kinds of yoga.

32:35.782 --> 32:37.917
We have the
restorative, meditative,

32:37.951 --> 32:41.553
peaceful Shavasana
like you are doing.

32:41.587 --> 32:44.757
And then we have the angry
yoga where we let it out.

32:44.791 --> 32:46.291
And we do fist unicorn.

32:46.325 --> 32:48.828
Fuck shit, cocksucker,
motherfucker.

32:48.861 --> 32:51.597
Yeah, fuck that shit.

32:51.631 --> 32:53.967
Excellent, Ysabel.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.835
Okay. Come on, Ysabel.

32:56.703 --> 32:58.303
Come on, we go.

32:58.337 --> 32:59.137
What do you mean?

32:59.171 --> 33:00.740
- What?
- We go.

33:00.773 --> 33:01.841
- What about Keith?
- What?

33:01.874 --> 33:03.175
It's okay.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.777
Hey.

33:04.811 --> 33:06.813
You have to let out
the anger, Keith.

33:06.846 --> 33:08.781
Until then, bye bye.

33:08.815 --> 33:10.182
What do you mean bye bye?

33:10.215 --> 33:11.651
Where are you going?

33:11.684 --> 33:13.753
Bye bye.

33:13.786 --> 33:14.954
Let out your anger.

33:14.988 --> 33:15.922
I'm not angry.

33:15.955 --> 33:17.422
I just can't walk.

33:17.456 --> 33:19.692
You're taking a wheelchair
from a man who can't walk.

33:19.726 --> 33:20.793
Okay, bye bye.

33:20.827 --> 33:22.095
What?

33:22.127 --> 33:24.196
You're gonna stand there.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.700
A couple of pricks, man.

33:27.734 --> 33:28.567
Really?

33:30.369 --> 33:32.038
Is this fun for you?

33:32.872 --> 33:34.473
They just left me there.

33:34.506 --> 33:37.644
Gordon had a program and
you did not participate.

33:37.677 --> 33:38.510
But I did.

33:41.648 --> 33:44.282
I want you to talk
to mini Keith here

33:44.316 --> 33:47.486
and say the things that
you've been afraid to say.

33:47.519 --> 33:48.821
Don't hold back.

33:48.855 --> 33:51.858
Everything that you're
feeling towards Keith

33:51.891 --> 33:53.458
that you want to say,

33:53.492 --> 33:55.628
you say it to him,
to mini Keith.

33:55.662 --> 33:58.131
If we don't have sex
for another nine months,

33:58.163 --> 34:00.633
I mean, I would much prefer
that that doesn't happen.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.902
But my point is that
it doesn't matter.

34:02.935 --> 34:06.304
And I just want you to be happy.

34:06.338 --> 34:07.807
And I want you to laugh again,

34:07.840 --> 34:11.576
because you're the
funniest person I know.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.112
I love you so much.

34:15.014 --> 34:16.916
The stupider the approach,
the more people loved it.

34:16.949 --> 34:21.954
And the more people loved it,
the better it worked for them.

34:24.691 --> 34:25.858
It was unbelievable.

34:30.963 --> 34:32.330
Oh my God!

34:32.364 --> 34:33.532
- Keith, you're walking.
- Easy, easy.

34:33.565 --> 34:34.734
Legs, legs, legs, legs.

34:34.767 --> 34:36.035
- You're walking.
- Yes, I'm walking.

34:36.069 --> 34:37.469
He is a genius.

34:38.738 --> 34:42.041
Yeah, we're doing
sexual things.

34:42.075 --> 34:43.375
Yes, we are. We're doing.

34:50.783 --> 34:52.118
Did
you at any point

34:52.151 --> 34:55.788
believe you had
the power to heal?

34:55.822 --> 34:57.222
And I give you the light here.

34:57.255 --> 34:58.290
Are you ready to receive it?

35:04.664 --> 35:05.898
Look, you have all these people

35:05.932 --> 35:09.434
who are changing in
front of your very eyes,

35:09.468 --> 35:11.771
you start to believe
your own hype.

35:13.172 --> 35:14.006
Oh, wow!

35:14.941 --> 35:15.775
Wow!

35:16.642 --> 35:18.376
I really wanna do that.

35:18.410 --> 35:22.215
Did you believe
that he could heal people?

35:22.247 --> 35:23.716
Why not?

35:23.750 --> 35:25.417
People like him often
have special powers.

35:35.962 --> 35:38.831
People flocked to the camp.

35:38.865 --> 35:41.466
I mean, at the beginning
we wanted to make

35:41.500 --> 35:43.435
a small documentary with
a handful of people.

35:43.468 --> 35:45.171
Now we're getting dozens.

35:45.204 --> 35:48.107
And we're getting
amazing footage.

35:48.141 --> 35:52.145
But Seymour, he started
believing his own BS.

35:52.178 --> 35:54.346
The Renaissance.

35:54.379 --> 35:57.616
The most fantastic
periods in humankind

35:57.650 --> 36:00.352
because it took us
from the dark ages,

36:00.385 --> 36:04.589
the time of repression,
oppression and depression.

36:04.623 --> 36:07.960
And it let us out to expression.

36:07.994 --> 36:11.130
Now, the words

36:11.164 --> 36:13.132
in English mean rebirth.

36:15.134 --> 36:18.537
So today, we are going
to have a rebirth.

36:20.740 --> 36:23.276
I want to thank miss
Nicole over here.

36:23.308 --> 36:25.510
She was the inspiration
for this work of art,

36:25.544 --> 36:28.613
our own renaissance period.

36:28.648 --> 36:30.448
And I'm going to present to you,

36:30.482 --> 36:33.219
the masterpiece,
Nicole's vagina.

36:39.524 --> 36:42.494
Being a gay man, I've
never been around a vagina.

36:42.527 --> 36:43.729
I mean, I haven't really
been around a lot.

36:43.763 --> 36:45.198
Hey,
Jimmy you're okay.

36:45.231 --> 36:46.165
Come on, Layla.

36:46.199 --> 36:47.066
We're gonna go break through

36:47.099 --> 36:48.901
the mental placenta and rebirth.

36:51.503 --> 36:53.005
I took the plunge,
went up the slide

36:53.039 --> 36:54.506
and I shot right out.

36:54.539 --> 36:56.642
And I was like, this
is what it feels like

36:56.676 --> 36:59.312
to be back in my mom's
womb and coming out.

36:59.344 --> 37:02.248
But I actually think I
was a C-section baby.

37:02.281 --> 37:04.349
So I'm not really sure if
that really relates to that.

37:04.382 --> 37:07.720
Go, go, go.

37:07.753 --> 37:08.754
Ooh, la, la.

37:11.724 --> 37:14.526
Ooh, la, la, come
on down the slide.

37:14.559 --> 37:15.393
Go.

37:16.729 --> 37:18.264
He'd commissioned an
artist to sculpt the vagina

37:18.297 --> 37:19.765
in the liking of a
famous porn star.

37:19.799 --> 37:21.267
$25,000.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.337
I'm really proud of this.

37:24.369 --> 37:27.039
I love Gordon and I love Reboot.

37:28.473 --> 37:31.077
I'm really, really happy to
support his work with my art.

37:31.110 --> 37:33.012
But he was blowing
through our budget.

37:33.045 --> 37:34.512
How bad was it?

37:34.546 --> 37:35.513
It's never good when you
gotta call the producer

37:35.547 --> 37:36.916
and ask for more.

37:38.084 --> 37:40.786
But as we know from the secret,

37:40.820 --> 37:44.657
when you need something,
it magically appears.

37:45.490 --> 37:46.591
Don't you worry, Coop.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.027
We'll take good care of her.

37:48.060 --> 37:48.895
Okay. Bye.

37:51.463 --> 37:53.866
- So we have her for the shoot.
- No freaking way, man.

37:53.900 --> 37:55.567
- It's not that big a deal.
- Dude, we give in now,

37:55.600 --> 37:56.601
we've lost the
whole damn project.

37:56.636 --> 37:57.870
You're being a
little dramatic.

37:57.904 --> 37:59.038
- Dramatic?
- Yeah.

37:59.071 --> 38:00.273
It's the same
producer shit as always.

38:00.306 --> 38:02.141
Dangle the money and
dance monkey dance.

38:02.174 --> 38:03.376
Come on. She's
just an actress.

38:03.408 --> 38:04.409
- Oh, an actress.
- Plus she has

38:04.442 --> 38:05.711
- production experience.
- Come on!

38:05.745 --> 38:07.246
She's a failed actress
and a wannabe producer.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.981
She's a charity case, gonna
poke her nose in our shit.

38:09.015 --> 38:11.083
So you got something
to hide, 'cause I don't.

38:11.117 --> 38:13.152
Seymour, she's his niece.

38:13.185 --> 38:14.120
You know the rule.

38:14.153 --> 38:15.054
What do you care?

38:15.087 --> 38:16.389
We always have a line producer.

38:16.421 --> 38:18.224
- So she's the line producer.
- Horrible idea.

38:18.257 --> 38:20.226
Look, every leader
has a strong second.

38:20.259 --> 38:21.426
A lieutenant.

38:21.459 --> 38:23.796
Someone working things
behind the scenes.

38:23.829 --> 38:25.665
Seymour loved the idea
of having a fluffer.

38:25.698 --> 38:26.999
Not everyone has the luxury

38:27.033 --> 38:28.401
of just shooting and directing.

38:28.433 --> 38:31.436
Someone had to manage
this whole charade.

38:36.008 --> 38:37.442
That was good.

38:37.475 --> 38:40.646
You must be Seymour,
which must make you Danny.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.783
Gordon St. Pierre at
your service, madame.

38:43.816 --> 38:45.284
Dear Lord.

38:45.318 --> 38:46.451
I'm sorry. Why are you filming?

38:46.484 --> 38:47.687
That's how
documentaries are made.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.289
Yeah, I didn't sign up
for a reality TV show.

38:50.323 --> 38:51.324
Okay. Let's take it back.

38:51.357 --> 38:52.758
No.

38:52.792 --> 38:54.427
We're making a groundbreaking
documentary film here.

38:54.459 --> 38:55.628
It's amazing footage.

38:55.661 --> 38:57.495
You're gonna freak
out when you see it.

38:57.529 --> 38:59.031
Okay, let me
clarify something.

38:59.065 --> 39:01.167
I'm doing Cooper a favor.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.368
I don't need this.

39:02.401 --> 39:04.270
I had a recurring role
on "Whistleblowers."

39:04.303 --> 39:06.504
I was a guest star on
"Donnie B. English"

39:06.538 --> 39:09.108
and a judge on
"Canadian Beacon."

39:09.141 --> 39:10.343
Canadian bacon?

39:10.376 --> 39:12.311
- "Canadian Beacon."
- Wow! What's that?

39:12.345 --> 39:13.511
That's funny.

39:13.545 --> 39:15.281
Claire, we're so happy
to have you honestly.

39:15.314 --> 39:17.149
All your experience
we could use.

39:17.183 --> 39:18.117
We're so happy.

39:18.150 --> 39:19.018
Experience.

39:19.051 --> 39:20.286
We said from the beginning

39:20.319 --> 39:21.687
it'd be just him and I
and a second camera guy.

39:21.721 --> 39:24.123
No PAs, no crew that
could leak information.

39:24.156 --> 39:26.325
We couldn't afford
a single slip up.

39:26.359 --> 39:27.994
I thought the producer
was gonna pull the plug

39:28.027 --> 39:29.494
if we didn't hire her.

39:29.527 --> 39:31.030
Isn't that great? Isn't
that what we always wanted?

39:31.063 --> 39:32.164
I saw that.

39:33.366 --> 39:35.134
Dude, what the hell
is wrong with you?

39:35.167 --> 39:36.068
What, man?

39:36.102 --> 39:37.136
She's gonna fuck shit up.

39:37.169 --> 39:39.472
We need the money. Remember?

39:39.504 --> 39:42.574
Air is what we're
going to work on today.

39:42.607 --> 39:44.477
Because from air come?

39:44.509 --> 39:46.412
- Life.
- Life. Excellent.

39:46.445 --> 39:48.314
We are going to not
only take in air,

39:48.347 --> 39:50.683
but we're going
to take in energy.

39:50.716 --> 39:54.353
The white light is gonna come
through with the breathing.

39:54.387 --> 39:57.356
Everyone toes together,
eyes closed, palms out

39:57.390 --> 39:58.556
and breathe in.

40:00.059 --> 40:01.827
Breathe in the energy
and the white light

40:01.861 --> 40:04.596
and come to heart
center, exhale.

40:06.065 --> 40:07.565
Again, breathe in.

40:09.402 --> 40:10.903
And exhale to heart center.

40:10.936 --> 40:12.171
Claire, come on, come on.

40:12.204 --> 40:13.372
You have to get
a lung full, huh?

40:13.406 --> 40:14.673
I'm just gonna
take a look at it.

40:14.707 --> 40:15.908
Claire,.

40:15.941 --> 40:17.009
Take off the shoes, huh?

40:17.043 --> 40:18.411
Let's feel the earth, everyone.

40:18.444 --> 40:20.578
Grab with the toes the grass.

40:20.612 --> 40:23.049
Feel it as we take
another lung full.

40:23.082 --> 40:24.450
Claire, come on.

40:24.483 --> 40:27.119
Dig into the ground and go.

40:27.153 --> 40:28.721
Claire, come on.

40:28.754 --> 40:29.989
Deep breath in.

40:31.589 --> 40:34.393
Again, heart center, blow out.

40:34.427 --> 40:35.628
Deep breath in.

40:36.929 --> 40:39.832
Again on your own.
Claire, come on.

40:40.666 --> 40:41.767
And together.

40:43.135 --> 40:46.772
Everyone, Claire is officially
a member of the camp now.

40:46.806 --> 40:48.808
She did it as a sign.

40:48.841 --> 40:50.876
Come on. What do
we say to Claire?

40:50.910 --> 40:51.944
We say, love and light.

40:54.280 --> 40:58.250
Claire definitely had
a broomstick up her bum.

40:59.418 --> 41:00.453
I am so sorry.

41:00.486 --> 41:01.654
Are you serious right now?

41:01.687 --> 41:03.556
- You almost wet my book.
- I'm very sorry.

41:03.588 --> 41:05.057
This is a very important book.

41:05.091 --> 41:07.592
My mother gave this to me.

41:07.625 --> 41:11.664
I hate using that word,
but she was a raging bitch.

41:11.697 --> 41:13.065
We had to get Claire on board.

41:13.099 --> 41:14.300
Campers were complaining.

41:14.333 --> 41:15.768
Danny was going nuts.

41:15.801 --> 41:17.803
Look, I know she's your
niece and everything.

41:17.837 --> 41:20.272
But if we could please just
remove her from the project.

41:20.306 --> 41:23.776
She's really
messing it up, dude.

41:23.809 --> 41:24.609
No can do.

41:24.643 --> 41:26.779
No can do, compadre.

41:26.812 --> 41:27.980
She is family.

41:29.315 --> 41:32.151
She's jeopardizing the
entire project, Coop.

41:32.184 --> 41:35.321
Look, I know she
can be a tough cookie

41:35.354 --> 41:38.090
but she can be a great asset.

41:38.124 --> 41:39.158
She's fighting
with the campers.

41:39.191 --> 41:40.426
I just saw her inside.

41:40.459 --> 41:42.461
She was fighting with
this dude, Herbert.

41:42.495 --> 41:44.096
Fine.

41:44.130 --> 41:44.997
Fine.

41:45.030 --> 41:46.932
I'll talk to her, okay?

41:46.966 --> 41:48.434
But you guys have
to win her over.

41:48.467 --> 41:53.405
Just tell Seymour to sprinkle
some of his guru magic on her.

41:54.673 --> 41:56.308
A little to the left.

41:56.342 --> 41:57.176
What?

41:57.209 --> 41:59.211
Not you, her.

42:16.896 --> 42:18.297
Oh, no.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.965
I am not having a
romantic dinner with you.

42:19.999 --> 42:21.300
Okay, it's not
a romantic dinner.

42:21.333 --> 42:22.168
Hey, hey.

42:23.169 --> 42:24.970
I will make a deal with you.

42:25.004 --> 42:27.506
Give me three guesses
about you and your life.

42:27.540 --> 42:28.707
For everyone I get right,

42:28.741 --> 42:30.743
you take a step
forward towards me.

42:30.776 --> 42:33.245
I get all three
right, then you stay.

42:33.279 --> 42:36.081
I get even one
wrong, you can go.

42:37.082 --> 42:37.917
Deal?

42:39.852 --> 42:41.587
Okay, fine.

42:41.620 --> 42:42.454
Okay.

42:44.223 --> 42:48.861
You pride yourself as being
this great independent thinker

42:48.894 --> 42:51.263
but you actually don't
trust anyone or anything

42:51.297 --> 42:54.099
unless you have
definitive proof.

42:57.069 --> 42:59.605
Sometimes, not always,

42:59.639 --> 43:01.874
you doubt the choices
you've made in life.

43:01.907 --> 43:04.109
Yes. Even confident Claire.

43:09.815 --> 43:14.720
You have like this unbelievable
amount of unused potential

43:15.821 --> 43:18.891
that somehow you haven't
taken advantage of.

43:22.761 --> 43:24.263
Okay, Ms. Cleo.

43:24.296 --> 43:25.197
You got me.

43:25.231 --> 43:26.465
Thank you for humoring me.

43:26.498 --> 43:28.801
God, is it really that simple?

43:28.834 --> 43:30.236
A sucker born every day.

43:30.269 --> 43:32.805
Look, were not psychics.

43:32.838 --> 43:34.240
But, yeah.

43:34.273 --> 43:36.075
I mean, if we can show
that not even just suckers,

43:36.108 --> 43:40.279
but regular people,
smart, freethinking people

43:40.312 --> 43:43.482
can be susceptible to these
con men and con women,

43:43.515 --> 43:48.520
well, we'll have made something
great, wouldn't we have?

43:49.255 --> 43:50.155
And what about you?

43:50.189 --> 43:51.824
You're an actress, right?

43:51.857 --> 43:55.427
Why not have the perfect
role for yourself?

43:56.962 --> 43:58.698
I'll make you a deal.

44:00.032 --> 44:03.802
You teach a session
tomorrow, see how it feels.

44:03.836 --> 44:05.604
If you like it, you stay.

44:05.639 --> 44:07.373
If you don't, you go.

44:13.612 --> 44:14.446
Okay.

44:15.281 --> 44:16.115
I will.

44:17.182 --> 44:19.785
Was this like closing
the deal for you?

44:19.818 --> 44:21.320
I just don't eat carbs.

44:21.353 --> 44:22.656
Oh! Right.

44:22.689 --> 44:25.124
Mistake numero uno.

44:25.157 --> 44:27.661
Are you going to just stand
there and resist everything?

44:27.694 --> 44:28.594
Because if that's
what you're gonna do,

44:28.627 --> 44:29.862
you might as well sit down.

44:29.895 --> 44:31.964
I just can't look at you.

44:31.997 --> 44:33.332
- Get up.
- Okay.

44:34.500 --> 44:35.801
Do you always do what
people tell you to do?

44:35.834 --> 44:37.269
I don't know.

44:37.303 --> 44:38.504
What uncomfortable thing
are you willing to do

44:38.537 --> 44:40.172
to get closer to your bliss?

44:40.205 --> 44:41.473
Oh, God!

44:41.507 --> 44:42.341
I'll sing.

44:43.809 --> 44:45.444
Because you're afraid
of what people will think?

44:45.477 --> 44:48.648
No, I just really
hate my voice.

44:48.682 --> 44:50.549
Are we going to
make Anita feel bad?

44:50.582 --> 44:52.117
- No.
- Come on, gang.

44:52.151 --> 44:53.218
We love Anita.

44:53.252 --> 44:54.453
We love Anita.

44:54.486 --> 44:55.454
We love you.

44:55.487 --> 44:56.388
We love Anita.

44:56.422 --> 44:57.589
We love Anita.

44:59.024 --> 45:02.594
- So, Anita, what song are you going to sing?
- Deep breath.

45:06.031 --> 45:08.334
<i>♪ Hello, my honey ♪</i>

45:08.367 --> 45:10.202
<i>♪ Hello, my baby ♪</i>

45:10.235 --> 45:12.538
<i>♪ Hello, my ragtime gal ♪</i>

45:12.571 --> 45:15.207
<i>♪ Send me a kiss by wire ♪</i>

45:15.240 --> 45:18.745
<i>♪ Baby, my heart's on fire ♪</i>

45:18.778 --> 45:20.747
<i>♪ If you release me ♪</i>

45:20.780 --> 45:23.248
<i>♪ Baby, you'll lose me ♪</i>

45:23.282 --> 45:24.917
<i>♪ Hey, you'll
be left alone ♪</i>

45:24.950 --> 45:27.019
<i>♪ Oh baby cell phone ♪</i>

45:27.052 --> 45:29.756
<i>♪ And tell me I'm your own ♪</i>

45:29.789 --> 45:31.190
Oh, and big finish.

45:31.223 --> 45:32.224
Yeah, Anita.

45:34.193 --> 45:35.361
It's fantastic.

45:35.394 --> 45:37.731
Fantastic. Fantastic.

45:37.764 --> 45:39.198
- Sit on down.
- Excellent effort.

45:39.231 --> 45:40.532
Let me get the visor.

45:40.566 --> 45:42.769
- Excellent. Excellent.
- All right, who's next?

45:42.802 --> 45:44.036
You.

45:44.069 --> 45:45.705
From that point
on, she was in.

45:45.739 --> 45:48.574
I mean, she pulled
a complete 180.

45:50.943 --> 45:52.878
Herbert has something
very important

45:52.911 --> 45:54.480
he'd like to share.

45:57.817 --> 45:59.451
I did what you told me.

45:59.485 --> 46:00.854
I left Marissa.

46:00.886 --> 46:02.388
Here. Take it.

46:02.421 --> 46:03.288
I don't want it anymore.

46:03.322 --> 46:04.189
Throw it away.

46:04.223 --> 46:06.693
No more viruses for me.

46:06.726 --> 46:08.227
And I'm moving in.

46:09.428 --> 46:12.264
Yeah, reboot 24/7.

46:12.297 --> 46:13.532
That's what I need.

46:13.565 --> 46:14.566
I'm staying.

46:15.567 --> 46:16.402
Okay.

46:20.807 --> 46:22.274
Okay.

46:22.307 --> 46:23.208
We'll talk about this.

46:23.242 --> 46:24.543
Okay, Herbert?

46:24.576 --> 46:25.812
Come on, Herbie.

46:25.845 --> 46:26.780
Chop, Chop.

46:28.447 --> 46:30.249
Lots of things to do.

46:31.785 --> 46:35.120
Danny thinks Claire
put Herbert up to it.

46:35.154 --> 46:36.555
Did his
presence in the house

46:36.588 --> 46:38.123
affect your project?

46:38.157 --> 46:40.626
Well, not at first,
but in hindsight,

46:40.660 --> 46:42.327
we should never let him move in.

46:42.361 --> 46:43.897
Why?

46:43.929 --> 46:46.565
Because it gave Claire
her first disciple.

46:58.010 --> 46:59.411
At that point, we'd
been running the camp,

46:59.445 --> 47:02.581
shooting the
documentary for months.

47:02.614 --> 47:03.683
I was exhausted.

47:03.716 --> 47:05.284
Seymour was exhausted.

47:05.317 --> 47:06.786
Claire just turned
it up a notch.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.688
You really don't
know how lucky you are

47:08.721 --> 47:11.423
to have access to Gordon.

47:11.457 --> 47:14.960
I mean, he really is much more
enlightened than he leads on.

47:14.993 --> 47:16.528
I really shouldn't be
telling you this story

47:16.562 --> 47:18.564
but Gordon saved my leg.

47:23.235 --> 47:24.838
I was in the middle
of a nasty divorce

47:24.871 --> 47:27.640
and my ex had taken
all my savings

47:27.674 --> 47:30.309
and changed the lock
to our apartment.

47:30.342 --> 47:32.846
So I had lunch at a diner.

47:32.879 --> 47:36.114
I ended up reading a book
that someone had left.

47:36.148 --> 47:39.384
It's funny how sometimes
books find us, don't they?

47:39.418 --> 47:40.986
Yeah.

47:41.019 --> 47:43.923
This one was called,
"I Love Dick."

47:45.557 --> 47:49.561
It was about female
struggle for power.

47:49.595 --> 47:51.965
It inspired me to go for a hike

47:51.997 --> 47:55.033
through the national park
where I met some hikers

47:55.067 --> 47:58.070
that invited me
to come with them

47:58.103 --> 47:59.706
to a designated dark sky area,

47:59.739 --> 48:02.909
which is basically a spot
with no light pollution.

48:02.942 --> 48:06.713
All of a sudden, something
scraped across my legs.

48:06.746 --> 48:07.914
Something bit me.

48:07.947 --> 48:10.650
So I jumped up and
fell right back down.

48:10.683 --> 48:14.721
In the matter of minutes,
I had a 100-degree fever.

48:14.754 --> 48:17.256
I was shivering and we
were one full day hike away

48:17.289 --> 48:19.525
from my car and right there,

48:19.558 --> 48:24.563
I just lost all feeling in
my legs and just passed out.

48:25.732 --> 48:27.934
Turns out Gordon was
one of the hikers.

48:29.201 --> 48:33.372
No way.

48:33.405 --> 48:37.677
And he performed a
cleansing ritual on my leg.

48:37.710 --> 48:42.080
And the next morning I
woke up feeling brand new.

48:42.114 --> 48:43.917
It's amazing.

48:43.950 --> 48:48.220
If it weren't for Gordon,
I'd be in a wheelchair.

48:50.757 --> 48:51.891
And here I am.

48:51.925 --> 48:53.927
- Wow.
- Yeah.

48:55.227 --> 48:56.629
The more unbelievable
the stories

48:56.663 --> 48:58.063
about the leader's greatness,

48:58.096 --> 48:59.966
the more followers believe it

48:59.999 --> 49:02.936
because it confirms
their dedication.

49:02.969 --> 49:07.272
It tells them, I'm in the
presence of greatness.

49:07.306 --> 49:08.607
Fantastic.

49:08.641 --> 49:09.943
Fantastic. Yeah.

49:09.976 --> 49:10.777
Yeah.

49:10.810 --> 49:12.045
Life-changing.

49:12.077 --> 49:15.080
My mates told me you
could fix my problems.

49:15.113 --> 49:17.115
Stand up onto this...

49:17.149 --> 49:18.216
Stand up.

49:18.250 --> 49:19.752
- What? On this thing?
- Oh yeah.

49:19.786 --> 49:20.954
Yeah, go on.

49:22.421 --> 49:23.990
Do I look the
same or do I look different?

49:24.023 --> 49:25.123
Oh, now you look small,
'cause I'm looking at-

49:25.157 --> 49:26.059
Aha!

49:26.960 --> 49:28.460
Now sit again.

49:28.493 --> 49:30.562
Breathin' and standing on
a sofa is not gonna fix it.

49:30.596 --> 49:31.463
It's the women.

49:31.496 --> 49:33.498
It's the women.

49:33.532 --> 49:34.734
There's too many.

49:34.767 --> 49:37.102
I think the problem
is the talking.

49:37.135 --> 49:38.470
The talking.

49:38.503 --> 49:40.940
They talk, I can't shut 'em up.

49:40.974 --> 49:44.176
You cannot hear
if you are talking.

49:44.209 --> 49:46.278
If we change the way
we look at things,

49:46.311 --> 49:49.214
the things we look
at, they change.

49:54.954 --> 49:56.990
- Are you all right?
- How do you feel?

49:57.023 --> 50:00.325
It was my pleasure to help you.

50:00.359 --> 50:01.560
Love and light.

50:05.698 --> 50:06.531
What?

50:15.908 --> 50:16.876
That's the answer.

50:16.909 --> 50:18.711
Stand on a sofa.

50:18.745 --> 50:20.345
Stand on a sofa.

50:20.379 --> 50:21.213
Yes.

50:22.314 --> 50:25.283
He explained to me
that standing on a sofa

50:25.317 --> 50:27.152
can change everything.

50:30.222 --> 50:31.658
Everything.

50:31.691 --> 50:32.692
And that's why

50:32.725 --> 50:35.193
you're standing on a sofa now?

50:37.162 --> 50:38.965
Because he healed me.

50:38.998 --> 50:42.001
To most of us, he was
more than just a guy.

50:42.035 --> 50:43.903
He was our spiritual leader.

50:43.936 --> 50:47.572
Feel nature through
the fingertips.

50:47.606 --> 50:48.841
Bless you, my son.

50:48.875 --> 50:50.677
- Yeah, thank you.
- Bless you.

50:50.710 --> 50:53.146
So much love for all of you.

50:53.178 --> 50:55.915
You're fantastic all of you.

50:55.948 --> 50:59.085
Claire approached me about
doing this special effect.

50:59.118 --> 51:02.354
She wanted to have
Gordon walk on water.

51:02.387 --> 51:03.723
It's ridiculous.

51:03.756 --> 51:05.024
I mean, it's easy.

51:05.058 --> 51:06.693
You use some clear
plexi and whatever

51:06.726 --> 51:08.928
but I told her it's too hokey.

51:08.961 --> 51:12.031
Danny was becoming
more and more negative.

51:12.065 --> 51:13.565
If we can feature
her a little more.

51:13.598 --> 51:14.399
- Sex sells.
- Oh, guys.

51:14.433 --> 51:15.702
That's all I'm saying.

51:15.735 --> 51:18.537
Boy, do I have a
surprise for you?

51:19.471 --> 51:20.572
Check it out.

51:22.541 --> 51:23.743
What the hell is this?

51:23.776 --> 51:26.244
It's called
"Rebooting Your Bliss."

51:26.278 --> 51:27.847
Yeah, I
can read, Claire.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.448
What's it supposed to be?

51:29.481 --> 51:30.683
Okay, chill.

51:30.717 --> 51:31.583
Every organization
has its manual.

51:31.616 --> 51:33.086
That's all it is.

51:33.119 --> 51:34.553
Manual? Where do you get
all the materials for this?

51:34.586 --> 51:37.222
Oh, Seymour was kind
enough to give me his notes.

51:37.255 --> 51:38.457
Right, Seymour?

51:38.490 --> 51:40.026
You knew about this, bro?

51:40.059 --> 51:41.293
We could use handouts.

51:41.326 --> 51:42.762
Handouts? This is
a fucking hard cover.

51:42.795 --> 51:45.898
I mean, anything Claire said,
he would just shut it down.

51:45.932 --> 51:49.035
One day, I went out
to get some equipment

51:49.068 --> 51:50.368
but I left my wallet.

51:50.402 --> 51:51.671
So I went back.

51:53.106 --> 51:55.742
He was glistening
like a stuck pig.

51:55.775 --> 51:58.945
Were
they having an affair?

51:58.978 --> 52:01.114
He sure loved the attention.

52:01.147 --> 52:02.148
An affair?

52:03.082 --> 52:03.916
No.

52:05.317 --> 52:06.853
I mean, not really.

52:08.487 --> 52:10.422
Danny
thinks you might have.

52:10.455 --> 52:12.892
He was pawing her like
a horny little shitzu.

52:12.925 --> 52:14.326
It was embarrassing.

52:14.359 --> 52:17.096
It went on like
that for awhile.

52:17.130 --> 52:18.330
I tried to reason
with my brother.

52:18.363 --> 52:19.799
He was not listening.

52:19.832 --> 52:22.101
But then, I ran into Grace.

52:23.301 --> 52:26.105
Danny was really
concerned about Seymour.

52:26.139 --> 52:27.940
He felt that Claire was
taking over the project

52:27.974 --> 52:30.143
and he didn't know what to do.

52:30.176 --> 52:32.477
He didn't want to
abandon his brother.

52:32.511 --> 52:36.082
And she sends me this
photo, this stupid cat photo.

52:36.115 --> 52:38.918
I sent him this photo.

52:38.951 --> 52:40.285
But I hung in there.

52:40.318 --> 52:43.122
Can't believe I sent him that.

52:43.156 --> 52:46.025
This lady beside me,
she had this little case.

52:46.058 --> 52:49.427
And inside that case
where two chihuahuas.

52:49.461 --> 52:51.130
Two male chihuahuas.

52:51.164 --> 52:52.665
And those two chihuahuas,

52:52.698 --> 52:56.169
they started fornicatin'
right there on the plane.

52:56.202 --> 53:00.505
And I'm saying, "God, how can
I concentrate on the gospel?

53:00.539 --> 53:02.975
How can I concentrate
on my sermon

53:03.009 --> 53:06.646
when I'm sitting here witnessing
gay canine fornication?"

53:06.679 --> 53:09.548
And he said, "Son, here's
what you need to do.

53:09.581 --> 53:12.218
You need to get yourself
your own aeroplane."

53:12.251 --> 53:15.822
I said, "God, I'm a
man of simple means.

53:15.855 --> 53:18.691
I can't afford an
aeroplane, God."

53:18.724 --> 53:21.828
And he said, "Talk to
your congregation."

53:21.861 --> 53:22.929
Sects sell.

53:24.596 --> 53:26.833
They're financed through
member contributions.

53:26.866 --> 53:30.402
The lifestyles of some
of these plastic shamans

53:30.435 --> 53:32.470
are extraordinary.

53:32.504 --> 53:36.341
Exotic car collections,
private jets.

53:36.374 --> 53:39.312
They heard what God said,
and they reached down deep

53:39.344 --> 53:40.813
and they provided.

53:40.847 --> 53:44.150
They provided me
with this aeroplane,

53:44.183 --> 53:48.754
and here we are today with mags
and I can get there faster.

53:48.788 --> 53:50.388
I can get there before
the fornicators.

53:50.422 --> 53:52.325
I can get there
before the demons

53:52.357 --> 53:54.593
and I can spread
God's good word.

53:54.626 --> 53:58.363
And if they're designated a
religion, it's even tax-free.

53:58.396 --> 53:59.999
How many copies did you make?

54:00.032 --> 54:01.399
- A thousand.
- A thousand?

54:01.433 --> 54:03.269
- Uh-huh.
- What for?

54:03.302 --> 54:06.038
$24 and 99 cents per copy.

54:06.072 --> 54:07.874
We'll be making 25 grand
selling these puppies.

54:07.907 --> 54:09.541
We are not making
money off these people.

54:09.574 --> 54:10.877
Period. It's part of the rules.

54:10.910 --> 54:12.377
Rules are meant to be broken.

54:12.410 --> 54:13.679
If ethical issues aren't
enough, think legal, Claire.

54:13.713 --> 54:15.380
All right, let's
just hear her out.

54:15.413 --> 54:16.615
- Yes.
- I'm not hearing her out.

54:16.649 --> 54:18.450
Do you both have a
major malfunction?

54:18.483 --> 54:20.286
This is a documentary, Seymour.

54:20.319 --> 54:22.255
It's not real. Get
your head straight.

54:22.288 --> 54:24.522
What if Cooper pulls funding?

54:24.556 --> 54:25.858
Would you do it then?

54:25.892 --> 54:27.894
We are not making
money off these people.

54:27.927 --> 54:29.427
Period.

54:29.461 --> 54:32.098
You're not helping very much
when you're ripping them off.

54:32.131 --> 54:35.701
But how can you help people
unless you have the time

54:35.735 --> 54:39.404
and the gift to help
and it takes your life?

54:40.840 --> 54:43.376
We were proving our premise
way beyond the original idea.

54:43.408 --> 54:45.745
The key rule was, do
not take their money.

54:45.778 --> 54:47.813
And isn't that
what film is about?

54:47.847 --> 54:48.748
Pushing the boundaries?

54:48.781 --> 54:50.783
Make sure you get this.

54:52.852 --> 54:54.086
Hey, Seymour.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.388
Hey, bro.

54:55.420 --> 54:56.222
How's it going?

54:56.255 --> 54:57.589
Good, good, good.

54:57.622 --> 54:58.456
Good.

55:00.026 --> 55:00.860
Look, see.

55:02.328 --> 55:04.997
It's time to pull the plug, man.

55:05.031 --> 55:07.667
You know what, Danny? You're
bringing everybody down.

55:07.700 --> 55:09.168
Maybe it's you should
take a few weeks off.

55:09.201 --> 55:10.970
We're going down a
very slippery path.

55:11.003 --> 55:12.604
Well, good, 'cause
that's what art is.

55:12.638 --> 55:13.773
It's slippery. It's challenging.

55:13.806 --> 55:15.174
Don't fucking
patronize me, Seymour.

55:15.207 --> 55:16.175
I know what art is.

55:16.208 --> 55:17.109
Well then, you
know we're doing

55:17.143 --> 55:18.644
something groundbreaking here.

55:18.678 --> 55:20.846
Nobody's shot
anything like this.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.747
Isn't that what
we're doing here?

55:21.781 --> 55:22.614
To make something
groundbreaking?

55:22.648 --> 55:24.317
It was groundbreaking.

55:24.350 --> 55:26.953
Now you're standing here
in this weird ass pose

55:26.986 --> 55:28.754
holding a dolphin?

55:28.788 --> 55:30.289
Fuck off, Danny.

55:38.463 --> 55:40.532
I'm not the bad guy here.

55:47.073 --> 55:51.644
To be honest, I had my
doubts about Seymour at first.

55:51.677 --> 55:53.245
Danny, no.

55:53.279 --> 55:55.181
He was the real deal.

55:55.214 --> 55:59.617
You know, he had that
filmmaker's obsession.

55:59.652 --> 56:01.954
We always liked Danny.

56:01.988 --> 56:03.356
I feel like you really
connected with Danny.

56:03.389 --> 56:04.890
Who's Danny?

56:04.924 --> 56:06.726
Danny loved cameras.

56:06.759 --> 56:08.961
He was a quiet boy.

56:08.995 --> 56:12.365
Didn't do a sport
like the other kids.

56:12.398 --> 56:14.033
We mostly ran
around the backyard

56:14.066 --> 56:16.869
doing these little short films.

56:16.902 --> 56:18.871
When he got into
the film school,

56:18.904 --> 56:21.907
the first person that
he called was Sims.

56:21.941 --> 56:24.010
That's what he
called his brother.

56:24.043 --> 56:26.679
He was so proud when
he got into Cal Arts.

56:26.712 --> 56:30.049
I mean, Danny was gonna
be the next Tim Burton.

56:30.082 --> 56:34.186
Dropping out of Cal Arts
was a huge blow for him.

56:34.220 --> 56:37.589
His dad was pushing his
buttons, so he left.

56:37.622 --> 56:40.760
He sleep in our guest
room for months.

56:40.793 --> 56:45.530
He ended up in production,
but local production.

56:45.563 --> 56:50.568
You know, like commercial for
a car dealership, furniture.

56:53.305 --> 56:56.574
To Danny, Reboot
Camp was his way out

56:56.608 --> 56:59.045
of furniture commercial hell.

56:59.912 --> 57:02.882
I couldn't let him give that up.

57:02.915 --> 57:04.917
We always had differences
of opinion, man.

57:04.950 --> 57:06.752
I mean, it's part of
the creative process,

57:06.786 --> 57:09.722
but I did wanna make
a groundbreaking film.

57:09.755 --> 57:13.359
So I decided to
remain open-minded,

57:13.392 --> 57:14.860
take some time
off, clear my head.

57:14.894 --> 57:18.764
However, I left a couple
hidden cameras behind.

57:22.468 --> 57:23.936
Yeah.

57:23.969 --> 57:26.238
Why, hello.
It's so good to see you.

57:26.272 --> 57:28.606
Oh, nice to see you.

57:28.641 --> 57:30.142
Hello, monsieur Ja.

57:30.176 --> 57:31.077
How you doing, man?

57:31.110 --> 57:32.278
Hello. Hello, Mr. Koech.

57:32.311 --> 57:33.412
- How are you?
- How are you?

57:33.446 --> 57:34.880
- Good, good.
- So good to see you.

57:34.914 --> 57:36.882
I'm happy you can make it today.

57:36.916 --> 57:38.117
Heard so many
things about you.

57:38.150 --> 57:39.418
Yes, thank you.

57:39.452 --> 57:40.953
Yes, from this young
lady. It's fantastic.

57:40.986 --> 57:42.721
She's my angel, Claire.

57:42.755 --> 57:43.722
She really talked you up.

57:43.756 --> 57:45.157
I'll tell you that.

57:45.191 --> 57:47.927
She's really the brains
behind the operation.

57:47.960 --> 57:49.228
It's been really wonderful.

57:49.261 --> 57:50.963
It's actually Cooper's house.

57:50.996 --> 57:55.668
Yeah, nice.
I'm feeling the love. Look at those eyes.

57:55.701 --> 57:58.304
And then let's go, like,
let's do like a thing...

57:58.337 --> 57:59.905
There's a heightened
level of narcissism

57:59.939 --> 58:02.341
with celebrities, that
everybody's looking at me

58:02.374 --> 58:03.843
and everyone's talking about me.

58:03.876 --> 58:07.113
So I think it was especially
effective for celebrities.

58:07.146 --> 58:09.515
You know, Hollywood
is a tough town.

58:09.548 --> 58:10.783
It's very hard.

58:10.816 --> 58:15.020
And you gotta take any
advantage you can get.

58:15.054 --> 58:17.156
And you know, some of the things
you were saying last night

58:17.189 --> 58:19.125
and like that some of
the things you've done

58:19.158 --> 58:21.093
and working with
some of my friends,

58:21.127 --> 58:23.129
it seems to have
elevated their career.

58:23.162 --> 58:26.432
And so I'm looking
to possibly level up.

58:26.465 --> 58:29.001
We don't get to what
we want, and it's hey!

58:29.034 --> 58:30.136
I have a lot of anger.

58:30.169 --> 58:31.270
- A lot of anger?
- Yeah.

58:31.303 --> 58:32.771
And how do you
deal with this anger?

58:32.805 --> 58:34.473
I'll break things.

58:35.641 --> 58:39.211
I hate my neighbor and
I'll break shit of his.

58:39.245 --> 58:41.046
I learned something very
important about anger.

58:41.080 --> 58:42.214
All right, here it comes.

58:42.248 --> 58:45.551
There was a mosquito
on my testicle.

58:45.584 --> 58:49.788
Now, the first reaction
is, oh, there's a mosquito.

58:49.822 --> 58:51.023
You don't want
to hit your balls.

58:51.056 --> 58:52.324
And I learned on that day,

58:52.358 --> 58:56.028
do not respond to
anger with violence.

58:56.061 --> 58:59.165
Took me six months to
recover from that mosquito.

58:59.198 --> 59:00.466
I had a similar incident.

59:00.499 --> 59:01.700
Yes, please.

59:01.734 --> 59:04.537
I put like Bengay
too close to my leg

59:04.570 --> 59:05.804
and it got to my balls.

59:05.838 --> 59:07.540
Yeah. Worst feeling
in the world.

59:07.573 --> 59:08.807
It is the fire, huh.

59:08.841 --> 59:10.176
Yeah, yeah.

59:10.209 --> 59:11.143
Fire on the balls.

59:11.177 --> 59:12.678
Yeah. Fire on the balls.

59:12.711 --> 59:13.579
It's not good. Not good.

59:13.612 --> 59:14.980
Not good.

59:15.014 --> 59:16.482
- This is why we're talking.
- This is why I came

59:16.515 --> 59:20.085
to you, guru, because I
have anger issues too, guru.

59:20.119 --> 59:22.087
I wanna get rid of the
anger once and for all.

59:22.121 --> 59:24.089
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna make the angry face.

59:24.123 --> 59:24.957
Okay.

59:26.125 --> 59:27.426
- All right.
- Let's make the angry face.

59:27.459 --> 59:29.862
All the shit, which
we want to get rid of,

59:29.895 --> 59:31.397
I'm gonna put it on the Polaroid

59:31.430 --> 59:33.165
and we're gonna
throw the paper away.

59:33.199 --> 59:34.266
Just like that?

59:34.300 --> 59:35.434
Just like this. Okay?

59:35.467 --> 59:38.737
Well, I'm going to start
with you, Mr. Koech.

59:38.771 --> 59:41.574
Oh, that was a fantastic face.

59:41.607 --> 59:43.409
- Mr. Ja.
- I was not happy at all.

59:43.442 --> 59:44.944
Oh, that's a good face.

59:44.977 --> 59:46.212
I like it.

59:46.245 --> 59:47.146
It is nice.

59:49.248 --> 59:51.717
This is your Polaroid.

59:51.750 --> 59:54.420
So guys, this may take a
few seconds to start up.

59:54.453 --> 59:55.689
Yeah. Yeah.

59:55.721 --> 59:57.423
I want to work on
an exercise for you.

59:57.456 --> 1:00:00.192
It's been very effective
for the people in the camp.

1:00:00.226 --> 1:00:02.861
I'm going to demonstrate.

1:00:02.895 --> 1:00:04.863
It's very simple.

1:00:04.897 --> 1:00:07.233
We bring in the white light.

1:00:10.002 --> 1:00:11.136
And as we exhale.

1:00:11.170 --> 1:00:12.538
Fuck shit. Fuck
shit, motherfucker.

1:00:12.571 --> 1:00:13.906
Fuck shit, fuck!

1:00:15.174 --> 1:00:17.076
Fuck, motherfucker.

1:00:17.109 --> 1:00:18.611
Cocksucker.

1:00:18.645 --> 1:00:20.379
Fuck shit, cocksucker.

1:00:20.412 --> 1:00:22.281
- Shit, bitch.
- Let it out. Come on, Koech.

1:00:22.314 --> 1:00:23.916
Fucking shit, cocksucker.

1:00:23.949 --> 1:00:25.117
Yeah!

1:00:25.150 --> 1:00:28.487
Motherfucker you
shit bitch cunt shit.

1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:31.257
Motherfucking,
cock-sucking son of a bitch.

1:00:31.290 --> 1:00:32.424
Fuck you!

1:00:32.458 --> 1:00:33.993
- Oh, guys.
- Love it.

1:00:34.026 --> 1:00:35.160
High five, high five.

1:00:35.194 --> 1:00:36.595
Fantastic!

1:00:36.630 --> 1:00:38.564
Wow, that was effective.

1:00:38.597 --> 1:00:41.433
And I didn't know if this stuff
was gonna work, but it did.

1:00:41.467 --> 1:00:43.569
I think angry yoga
really worked.

1:00:43.602 --> 1:00:48.540
I mean, I think Ja Rule and
David Koechner especially

1:00:49.942 --> 1:00:51.277
had a complete breakthrough
with the angry yoga.

1:00:51.310 --> 1:00:53.812
Okay, let us see now
where the picture's at.

1:00:53.846 --> 1:00:55.749
Can I see the angry face?

1:00:55.781 --> 1:00:58.150
Ja, what do you see?

1:00:58.183 --> 1:01:01.987
What do you see when you
look at this angry face?

1:01:02.021 --> 1:01:02.855
I see...

1:01:05.659 --> 1:01:09.696
<i>♪ I see dreams of blue ♪</i>

1:01:09.729 --> 1:01:12.798

1:01:22.474 --> 1:01:24.977
Fuck shit, fuck shit, fuck shit.

1:01:25.010 --> 1:01:27.513
- Motherfucker.
- Fuck shit up, motherfucker.

1:01:27.546 --> 1:01:29.214
We're gonna fuck shit up.

1:01:29.248 --> 1:01:30.382
One.

1:01:30.416 --> 1:01:31.283
Two.

1:01:31.317 --> 1:01:32.151
Three.

1:01:37.356 --> 1:01:38.725
Fuck shit!

1:01:38.758 --> 1:01:41.695
Funny enough, the reality
stars were a problem.

1:01:41.728 --> 1:01:42.861
Poo!

1:01:42.895 --> 1:01:45.898
This is shit and this
is what you need.

1:01:46.766 --> 1:01:47.599
More shit.

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:49.669
I don't know what it is

1:01:49.703 --> 1:01:52.338
with that particular
group of people.

1:01:52.371 --> 1:01:54.039
I couldn't quite crack them.

1:01:54.073 --> 1:01:55.742
- Yes. Okay.
- Do another color.

1:01:55.775 --> 1:01:56.810
I'm getting there.

1:01:56.842 --> 1:01:58.844
- Yes, there.
- I might cry.

1:01:58.877 --> 1:02:02.481
I've noticed a common
theme from your painting,

1:02:02.514 --> 1:02:04.651
and that is the poo poo.

1:02:04.684 --> 1:02:07.986
What is your obsession
with the poopoo?

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:11.691
I feel like people
really let go of things

1:02:12.692 --> 1:02:14.661
through the anus.

1:02:14.694 --> 1:02:16.128
- The anus?
- Yes.

1:02:17.596 --> 1:02:19.098
People are telling me
you're fighting on the TV.

1:02:19.131 --> 1:02:20.399
Why are you fighting?

1:02:20.432 --> 1:02:23.703
See, the thing is is
that I'm always right?

1:02:23.737 --> 1:02:27.439
And people think that I'm
wrong, but I'm always right.

1:02:27.473 --> 1:02:30.309
It is more
important to be happy

1:02:31.310 --> 1:02:33.512
than to be right.

1:02:33.545 --> 1:02:35.547
I'm happy when I poop.

1:02:36.750 --> 1:02:38.884
You are a wonderful
human being.

1:02:38.917 --> 1:02:40.285
Thank you.

1:02:40.319 --> 1:02:43.555
And don't let the
virus clog the mind

1:02:44.957 --> 1:02:48.728
of the things that you
think are right or wrong,

1:02:48.762 --> 1:02:51.029
but just be okay with right now,

1:02:51.063 --> 1:02:53.532
who you are in this moment.

1:02:53.565 --> 1:02:55.200
I'm really hot.

1:02:55.234 --> 1:02:57.236
Yes. You're very nice.

1:02:58.470 --> 1:02:59.806
I love myself.

1:03:01.073 --> 1:03:03.108
Self-love is good.

1:03:03.142 --> 1:03:06.813
I think they are
just on another level

1:03:06.846 --> 1:03:09.081
of narcissistic way of life

1:03:10.650 --> 1:03:12.584
that even I couldn't crack.

1:03:12.618 --> 1:03:15.954
This Johnny Bananas
was quite bananas.

1:03:15.988 --> 1:03:17.055
Trust.

1:03:17.089 --> 1:03:18.290
Trust.

1:03:18.323 --> 1:03:19.793
- Gordon, you want gum?
- Johnny, it's not nice.

1:03:19.826 --> 1:03:20.760
- What are you doing?
- All this gum right here.

1:03:20.794 --> 1:03:21.627
No, I can't take your gum.

1:03:21.661 --> 1:03:22.961
Hey, Johnny.

1:03:22.995 --> 1:03:23.797
No, I'm also a germaphobe.

1:03:23.830 --> 1:03:24.731
She want gum.

1:03:24.764 --> 1:03:25.632
You want me to stop?

1:03:25.665 --> 1:03:27.065
No. This needs to fucking stop.

1:03:27.099 --> 1:03:28.567
- This is all fake.
- This is my true brother.

1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:30.436
There's no one way like
fake your fucking accent.

1:03:30.469 --> 1:03:33.071
Listen, you guys are
all being conned.

1:03:33.105 --> 1:03:36.074
You're better off
lighting $500 on fire.

1:03:36.108 --> 1:03:38.577
This is a sleep-away camp
of morons, all right?

1:03:38.610 --> 1:03:39.511
Okay, go. Bye. Bye.

1:03:39.545 --> 1:03:41.513
Namaste this, motherfuckers.

1:03:41.547 --> 1:03:42.749
I thought, Jeez.

1:03:42.782 --> 1:03:45.685
I think this guy is like
ready to go with me.

1:03:45.718 --> 1:03:48.688
And luckily we got them
out of there pretty quickly

1:03:48.721 --> 1:03:51.423
before they could infect
the rest of the camp.

1:03:51.457 --> 1:03:54.694
Thank you for being
part of this world now with us.

1:03:54.727 --> 1:03:55.662
We look forward to
having you around.

1:03:55.695 --> 1:03:56.763
Oh, we're part of this world?

1:03:56.796 --> 1:03:57.596
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:57.630 --> 1:03:58.464
No, yeah. We're in this.

1:03:58.497 --> 1:03:59.531
We're in this.

1:03:59.565 --> 1:04:00.466
It's great.

1:04:00.499 --> 1:04:02.134
Yes, listen to your husband.

1:04:02.167 --> 1:04:07.005
You know, we can give him
a ride down the vagina slide

1:04:07.039 --> 1:04:10.275
in a preparation for what's
coming out of the stomach

1:04:10.309 --> 1:04:11.510
through the canal.

1:04:11.543 --> 1:04:12.812
You could really
channel your child.

1:04:12.846 --> 1:04:13.979
That'll help me
get over my fear.

1:04:14.012 --> 1:04:15.314
You know the fear of
the, fear of all the...

1:04:15.347 --> 1:04:16.649
It's a baby.

1:04:16.683 --> 1:04:18.016
It is a fantastic experience.

1:04:20.586 --> 1:04:23.055
Oh, the brownies are nice, huh?

1:04:23.088 --> 1:04:24.323
Where is sugar
that brown again.

1:04:24.356 --> 1:04:25.557
Oh, looking nice,
looking brownies.

1:04:25.591 --> 1:04:27.660
Yeah, very nice.

1:04:27.694 --> 1:04:28.895
Don't mind if I do.

1:04:28.928 --> 1:04:30.697
Oh,.

1:04:30.730 --> 1:04:32.064
I may take one.

1:04:32.097 --> 1:04:33.867
I really needed
to get me a brownie

1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:36.669
before that camera gets here.

1:04:36.703 --> 1:04:38.103
Wait, wait, wait.

1:04:42.709 --> 1:04:45.678
<i>♪ Let me show you who I am ♪</i>

1:04:45.712 --> 1:04:47.479

1:04:53.185 --> 1:04:56.756
I'd taken a few weeks
off to clear my head.

1:04:56.789 --> 1:04:58.490
When I was finally
ready to come back,

1:04:58.524 --> 1:05:00.860
I didn't tell anyone.

1:05:00.894 --> 1:05:03.262
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1:05:04.429 --> 1:05:06.064
Oh my God.

1:05:06.098 --> 1:05:08.267
- That was so close.
- Oh my God, Danny.

1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:09.234
Danny.

1:05:09.268 --> 1:05:11.169
Danny, where you been, bro?

1:05:11.203 --> 1:05:12.070
Good to see you.

1:05:12.104 --> 1:05:13.006
Hey.

1:05:13.038 --> 1:05:14.707
Marissa and Laryssa, who? Huh?

1:05:17.242 --> 1:05:18.878
- Danny.
- Danny.

1:05:18.912 --> 1:05:20.847
Oh my God. We missed you.

1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:22.247
I knew you'd come back.

1:05:22.281 --> 1:05:23.081
- Hey, come into the party.
- You're just in time

1:05:23.115 --> 1:05:25.551
for the party, come on.

1:05:33.292 --> 1:05:34.727
You're pregnant.

1:05:34.761 --> 1:05:35.594
Oh yeah.

1:05:39.264 --> 1:05:40.098
Cheers.

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:44.369
Hey, man.

1:05:44.403 --> 1:05:45.237
What is this?

1:05:45.270 --> 1:05:46.471
We have celebrities now?

1:05:46.505 --> 1:05:48.041
Hey.

1:05:48.073 --> 1:05:49.876
Yeah, Claire thought it would
be good for the documentary.

1:05:49.909 --> 1:05:51.310
Hello.

1:05:51.343 --> 1:05:52.544
So she's
directing the film now?

1:05:52.578 --> 1:05:54.146
Come on, man. You've
been gone for two weeks.

1:05:54.179 --> 1:05:56.716
Gordon! Gordon, come here.

1:05:56.749 --> 1:05:58.216
Okay,.

1:05:58.250 --> 1:05:59.052
I'm gonna go over there.

1:05:59.084 --> 1:06:00.152
Have a nice time.

1:06:00.185 --> 1:06:01.253
Hey, guys.

1:06:01.286 --> 1:06:02.354
Hello. Hello.

1:06:05.959 --> 1:06:08.594
Seymour basically
let Claire take over.

1:06:23.042 --> 1:06:24.744
We had created a cult.

1:06:24.777 --> 1:06:26.411
Seymour wasn't Gordon anymore.

1:06:26.445 --> 1:06:28.681
He was now the Sherpa.

1:06:28.715 --> 1:06:31.416
What's funny is, he
didn't even see the irony.

1:06:31.450 --> 1:06:32.652
She renamed him.

1:06:32.685 --> 1:06:34.486
He's a Sherpa?

1:06:34.519 --> 1:06:36.321
Well,
that's what I thought

1:06:36.355 --> 1:06:38.825
you camp members called him.

1:06:38.858 --> 1:06:43.763
Oh, I thought a Sherpa
helps you summit Everest.

1:06:43.796 --> 1:06:47.466
But didn't you
climb some of your problems?

1:06:47.499 --> 1:06:48.935
Oh, that's interesting.

1:06:48.968 --> 1:06:50.970
Wow. I
hadn't thought of it that way.

1:06:51.004 --> 1:06:52.105
Yeah.

1:06:52.137 --> 1:06:53.873
Cult leaders
often rename members

1:06:53.906 --> 1:06:56.274
to strip them of their identity.

1:06:56.308 --> 1:06:58.945
It has a very deep,
psychological side effect

1:06:58.978 --> 1:07:01.613
because our parents name us.

1:07:01.648 --> 1:07:06.551
So assigning names asserts
the leader as a parent.

1:07:06.585 --> 1:07:08.520
It's very powerful.

1:07:08.553 --> 1:07:10.455
I think that's what
happened with Claire.

1:07:10.489 --> 1:07:12.290
You know, she's so
strikingly beautiful

1:07:12.324 --> 1:07:14.127
and powerful and smart

1:07:14.159 --> 1:07:17.429
that she just seems
special and amazing.

1:07:19.564 --> 1:07:22.068
And she makes you feel
special and amazing.

1:07:22.101 --> 1:07:24.169
Sherpa Gordon is
now going to lead us

1:07:24.202 --> 1:07:26.505
through a very
spiritual meditation.

1:07:26.538 --> 1:07:28.306
- Oh my God.
- Thank you so much.

1:07:30.242 --> 1:07:34.781
I want you to raise the
arms as one, up into the air.

1:07:36.581 --> 1:07:37.917
And then Seymour
showed me some footage

1:07:37.950 --> 1:07:41.020
they captured during my absence.

1:07:41.054 --> 1:07:43.022
He was quite proud of it.

1:07:43.056 --> 1:07:46.726
Anita, what color do
you have under there?

1:07:48.593 --> 1:07:49.662
I have on black.

1:07:49.696 --> 1:07:51.363
Good. Take off your blouse.

1:07:51.396 --> 1:07:53.265
You knew today was black day.

1:07:53.298 --> 1:07:55.068
We don't want any
color pollution.

1:07:55.101 --> 1:07:56.836
- Right?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:07:56.869 --> 1:08:00.205
But I thought that I
could just kinda...

1:08:01.406 --> 1:08:02.875
Take it off.

1:08:02.909 --> 1:08:04.110
All right, everyone.

1:08:04.143 --> 1:08:06.445
We are all going to do
a fantastic exercise-

1:08:06.478 --> 1:08:07.780
Claire, I'm sorry.

1:08:07.814 --> 1:08:11.216
I'm actually really not
comfortable with that.

1:08:11.249 --> 1:08:14.219
Reboot Camp only works if
everyone is 100% on board.

1:08:14.252 --> 1:08:15.387
Am I right?

1:08:15.420 --> 1:08:17.056
Gordon pushed us
past our comfort zones,

1:08:17.090 --> 1:08:19.192
but she was a drill sergeant.

1:08:19.224 --> 1:08:22.762
She actually enjoyed
bossing people around.

1:08:24.496 --> 1:08:25.698
Especially me.

1:08:25.732 --> 1:08:27.133
We're gonna take a deep inhale

1:08:27.166 --> 1:08:28.935
from all the way down.

1:08:28.968 --> 1:08:30.235
Deep inhale.

1:08:30.268 --> 1:08:32.304
And as we exhale,
we're gonna go, reboot.

1:08:32.337 --> 1:08:33.806
Reboot.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:35.373
Inhale.

1:08:35.407 --> 1:08:37.242
- Reboot.
- Reboot.

1:08:37.275 --> 1:08:38.477
Inhale. Keep going.

1:08:38.510 --> 1:08:39.879
Reboot.

1:08:39.912 --> 1:08:41.246
Faster.

1:08:41.279 --> 1:08:42.749
Reboot.

1:08:42.782 --> 1:08:43.783
Keep going.

1:08:43.816 --> 1:08:44.784
Reboot.

1:08:44.817 --> 1:08:45.718
And faster.

1:08:45.752 --> 1:08:47.419
Reboot.

1:08:47.452 --> 1:08:48.487
Reboot.

1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:50.022
- Faster.
- Reboot.

1:08:50.957 --> 1:08:53.059
Is this normal to you?

1:08:53.092 --> 1:08:55.293
'cause this is not
normal, Seymour.

1:08:55.327 --> 1:08:56.328
It's like the
Stanford experiment.

1:08:56.361 --> 1:08:58.497
Fuck the Stanford experiment.

1:08:58.530 --> 1:08:59.932
We've proven plenty of points.

1:08:59.966 --> 1:09:02.101
- It's time to end this.
- All right, take a breath.

1:09:02.135 --> 1:09:03.770
Guys, guys, guys.

1:09:05.104 --> 1:09:07.339
You don't realize what
you've created here.

1:09:07.372 --> 1:09:08.607
Oh God.

1:09:08.641 --> 1:09:11.778
Deepak Chopra is
worth $100 million.

1:09:11.811 --> 1:09:14.847
Tony Robbins, half a billion.

1:09:14.881 --> 1:09:16.348
So? What's your point?

1:09:16.381 --> 1:09:17.817
The Moonies guy's
worth a billion.

1:09:17.850 --> 1:09:19.752
Doesn't mean we should
create a cult to get rich.

1:09:19.786 --> 1:09:20.987
Not a cult.

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:23.522
A real self-help organization.

1:09:25.390 --> 1:09:27.459
I don't know about you guys,
but I am sick and tired

1:09:27.492 --> 1:09:28.928
of chasing the carrot.

1:09:28.961 --> 1:09:31.697
I am sick and tired of
begging Cooper for a job.

1:09:31.731 --> 1:09:32.999
I'm done with the bit parts.

1:09:33.032 --> 1:09:34.934
Guys, we have
great footage here.

1:09:34.967 --> 1:09:36.669
This documentary is
gonna do very well.

1:09:36.702 --> 1:09:37.602
This is not funny.

1:09:37.637 --> 1:09:39.604
Oh yeah? And what if it flops?

1:09:39.639 --> 1:09:43.508
You wanna go back to shooting
furniture commercials?

1:09:43.542 --> 1:09:45.845
Listen, think about it.

1:09:45.878 --> 1:09:46.712
Books.

1:09:47.579 --> 1:09:48.981
Events.

1:09:49.015 --> 1:09:49.849
Retreats.

1:09:50.817 --> 1:09:52.952
It'll fund your future.

1:09:52.985 --> 1:09:54.386
You can shoot
whatever film you want

1:09:54.419 --> 1:09:57.556
without some asshole producer
telling you what to do.

1:09:57.589 --> 1:10:01.694
And the best part, we're
actually helping people.

1:10:03.029 --> 1:10:04.897
It's the ultimate win-win.

1:10:04.931 --> 1:10:07.233
Did you consider
ditching the film project

1:10:07.266 --> 1:10:09.802
and continuing the cult?

1:10:09.836 --> 1:10:12.805
You mean the self-help empire?

1:10:12.839 --> 1:10:15.908
Danny thinks she did.

1:10:18.911 --> 1:10:20.947
Danny's an amazing kid.

1:10:22.347 --> 1:10:24.317
You know?

1:10:24.349 --> 1:10:28.187
I don't think he's got
a bad bone in his body.

1:10:29.889 --> 1:10:32.591
And that's the
worst part for me.

1:10:32.624 --> 1:10:34.961
Losing my brother over this.

1:10:37.930 --> 1:10:39.098
Claire was doing to me

1:10:39.131 --> 1:10:42.268
what I was doing to
these poor people.

1:10:43.435 --> 1:10:45.204
I just didn't wanna see it.

1:11:01.921 --> 1:11:03.388
To capture that,

1:11:04.456 --> 1:11:06.391
that was pure luck.

1:11:06.424 --> 1:11:07.727
Danny showed me the footage.

1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.195
She's fleecing
people and he's seeing

1:11:09.228 --> 1:11:11.931
a cinematic masterpiece
unfolding in front of his eyes.

1:11:11.964 --> 1:11:13.431
And what does he do?

1:11:13.465 --> 1:11:15.567
He goes and shows Claire
the hidden camera footage.

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:16.903
He betrayed you?

1:11:16.936 --> 1:11:18.804
I think he
underestimated Claire's capacity

1:11:18.838 --> 1:11:20.640
for self preservation.

1:11:20.673 --> 1:11:22.808
All the love, let it out.

1:11:22.842 --> 1:11:24.210
Let it out.

1:11:24.243 --> 1:11:26.145
In the state of
California, it is unlawful

1:11:26.178 --> 1:11:28.648
for any person to videotape film

1:11:28.681 --> 1:11:30.548
or digitally record
another person

1:11:30.582 --> 1:11:31.817
without that person's consent.

1:11:31.851 --> 1:11:32.952
Claire,
you're in my shot.

1:11:32.985 --> 1:11:35.321
In a bathroom,
bedroom or any location

1:11:35.354 --> 1:11:37.823
where a person has a reasonable
expectation of privacy.

1:11:37.857 --> 1:11:41.426
And especially if the person
is urinating, defecating,

1:11:41.459 --> 1:11:46.165
undressing, nude, or involved
in sexual intercourse.

1:11:46.198 --> 1:11:47.166
- Hey, what?
- Hey, hey.

1:11:47.199 --> 1:11:48.600
What's going on here?

1:11:48.634 --> 1:11:50.269
Your little brother's a
pervert. That's what's going on.

1:11:50.303 --> 1:11:51.469
What?

1:11:51.503 --> 1:11:53.005
This is bullshit.

1:11:53.039 --> 1:11:55.573
Oh yeah? And how
do you explain this?

1:11:55.607 --> 1:11:57.777
He set up hidden
cameras in the bathroom

1:11:57.810 --> 1:11:59.679
and recorded people
doing all kinds of stuff.

1:11:59.712 --> 1:12:00.578
Yeah, right.

1:12:00.612 --> 1:12:01.513
No, I didn't, Sims.

1:12:01.546 --> 1:12:02.514
Dude, why would you...

1:12:02.547 --> 1:12:03.649
This is disgusting.

1:12:03.683 --> 1:12:04.516
I didn't do that.

1:12:04.549 --> 1:12:05.517
I didn't believe it.

1:12:05.550 --> 1:12:06.518
I still don't believe it.

1:12:06.551 --> 1:12:07.753
He was such a nice, quiet boy.

1:12:07.787 --> 1:12:09.521
Yeah, they usually are.

1:12:09.554 --> 1:12:10.823
They were making a documentary

1:12:10.856 --> 1:12:12.490
and he was taping
people having sex.

1:12:12.524 --> 1:12:13.759
That's what they say.

1:12:13.793 --> 1:12:14.794
But to me, he was just-

1:12:14.827 --> 1:12:15.661
One word.

1:12:15.695 --> 1:12:16.696
Peeping Tom.

1:12:16.729 --> 1:12:18.631
That's two words.

1:12:18.664 --> 1:12:20.532
Everything happens
for a reason.

1:12:20.565 --> 1:12:21.767
What does that even mean?

1:12:21.801 --> 1:12:22.935
It means don't do
the crime if you can't-

1:12:22.969 --> 1:12:23.803
Shut up.

1:12:24.737 --> 1:12:26.138
Shut up?

1:12:26.172 --> 1:12:27.873
Never underestimate the
power of stupid people

1:12:27.907 --> 1:12:28.808
in large groups.

1:12:28.841 --> 1:12:29.709
Oh yeah.

1:12:29.742 --> 1:12:31.310
Well, you joined too, asshole.

1:12:31.344 --> 1:12:33.879
Anyway, Danny
was an awesome guy.

1:12:33.913 --> 1:12:35.314
I mean, super talented.

1:12:35.348 --> 1:12:36.449
He had to have been set up.

1:12:36.481 --> 1:12:37.515
That's right.

1:12:37.549 --> 1:12:40.653
- It's just that simple.
- Absolutely.

1:12:40.686 --> 1:12:43.122
Live by the sword,
die by the sword.

1:12:43.155 --> 1:12:45.758
Right?

1:12:52.198 --> 1:12:57.136
Where else can you hike in
the middle of a major city?

1:12:57.169 --> 1:13:02.008
Do you believe
Danny was set up by Claire?

1:13:03.242 --> 1:13:05.111
Do you see that haze?

1:13:06.412 --> 1:13:08.214
That's not small.

1:13:08.247 --> 1:13:12.852
That's the spirit of all
the dreams of everyone

1:13:12.885 --> 1:13:15.888
that comes here
looking for success.

1:13:18.190 --> 1:13:19.392
God, I love LA.

1:13:20.793 --> 1:13:24.263
I still had all this unresolved
stuff with Grace, right?

1:13:24.296 --> 1:13:27.500
Because she was my
wife and I trusted her.

1:13:27.532 --> 1:13:30.535
But then I discovered
all this crap.

1:13:31.704 --> 1:13:32.938
And I figured, well,
she lied to me.

1:13:32.972 --> 1:13:34.407
So why not Danny?

1:13:35.573 --> 1:13:36.776
She Photoshopped
the background,

1:13:36.809 --> 1:13:39.178
made it look like I
installed the cameras.

1:13:39.211 --> 1:13:40.679
It's pretty good.

1:13:40.713 --> 1:13:41.781
Why didn't
you show it to Seymour?

1:13:41.814 --> 1:13:43.949
He sided with the enemy, man.

1:13:43.983 --> 1:13:45.583
And I was love bombed.

1:13:45.617 --> 1:13:47.420
Claire love bombed me

1:13:48.553 --> 1:13:51.589
and turned me into
one of her disciples.

1:13:52.425 --> 1:13:54.226
I was done?

1:13:54.260 --> 1:13:55.728
I was done.

1:13:55.761 --> 1:13:58.397
The whole project
turned into a con.

1:13:58.431 --> 1:14:00.533
But it was a
con from the very beginning.

1:14:00.565 --> 1:14:02.968
You must have seen the irony.

1:14:09.241 --> 1:14:11.210
He's my brother,
and I took her side.

1:14:14.579 --> 1:14:16.415
And that's just wrong.

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:20.886
<i>♪ I've been waiting here ♪</i>

1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:23.456

1:14:36.702 --> 1:14:38.170
There's this saying.

1:14:38.204 --> 1:14:43.209
You don't know you're in a
cult until the last 10 minutes.

1:14:44.677 --> 1:14:48.180
My last 10 minutes happened
a few days after Danny left.

1:14:48.214 --> 1:14:51.016
I have some very shocking
news, but I feel like,

1:14:51.050 --> 1:14:52.685
I can't keep the
secret much longer,

1:14:52.718 --> 1:14:56.655
but I spotted Danny
placing some cameras

1:14:56.689 --> 1:14:59.825
all over the mansion and look,

1:14:59.859 --> 1:15:01.861
it turns out he's...

1:15:01.894 --> 1:15:04.029
- Oh my God.
- He's quite the pervert.

1:15:04.063 --> 1:15:05.931
- Oh my gosh.
- I have the pictures

1:15:05.965 --> 1:15:07.099
- and videos to prove it.
- No, you don't.

1:15:07.133 --> 1:15:08.534
No, you don't.

1:15:08.567 --> 1:15:10.169
Wait a second. I think
this is very inappropriate.

1:15:10.202 --> 1:15:11.537
No, don't even look at it.

1:15:11.570 --> 1:15:13.339
It hurts out as
much as you do.

1:15:13.372 --> 1:15:14.974
Danny's a dear friend of mine.

1:15:15.007 --> 1:15:17.810
Danny's a good friend
of mine, I love Danny.

1:15:17.843 --> 1:15:21.714
So I finally put all
the pieces together and realized

1:15:21.747 --> 1:15:25.818
that she doctored this
footage and set Danny up.

1:15:25.851 --> 1:15:29.155
The original plan was we were
gonna end this documentary

1:15:29.188 --> 1:15:30.356
with a bang.

1:15:30.389 --> 1:15:32.791
Have this big screening
where we show the film

1:15:32.825 --> 1:15:37.463
to the campers and then
reveal that it was all fake,

1:15:37.496 --> 1:15:38.898
and let them peek
behind the curtain

1:15:38.931 --> 1:15:42.735
and see all this behind
the scenes footage.

1:15:42.768 --> 1:15:45.237
Now, I had to improvise.

1:15:45.271 --> 1:15:47.206
Maisey, I wanted to
talk to you first,

1:15:47.239 --> 1:15:49.875
because you are my
most loyal camper.

1:15:49.909 --> 1:15:51.076
Really, truly.

1:16:01.620 --> 1:16:03.455
I'm not Sherpa Gordon.

1:16:06.091 --> 1:16:08.060
My name is Seymour Barr.

1:16:08.093 --> 1:16:10.196
And none of this is real.

1:16:15.401 --> 1:16:16.902
Thank you, Sherpa.

1:16:16.936 --> 1:16:18.437
No, no, no.

1:16:18.470 --> 1:16:19.371
I'm not the Sherpa.

1:16:19.405 --> 1:16:21.273
I'm a filmmaker.

1:16:21.307 --> 1:16:22.508
Do you understand?

1:16:22.541 --> 1:16:24.977
Look, I've got
some footage here.

1:16:33.485 --> 1:16:34.920
I'm really sorry.

1:16:41.327 --> 1:16:42.161
You.

1:16:43.462 --> 1:16:46.565
Oh, you are one sly
fox, Sherpa Gordon.

1:16:46.599 --> 1:16:47.499
What? No.

1:16:52.471 --> 1:16:53.739
This is it, isn't it?

1:16:53.772 --> 1:16:55.709
- No.
- This is it, right?

1:16:55.741 --> 1:16:57.243
This is the big virus removal.

1:16:57.276 --> 1:16:59.478
No, listen, this
is a documentary.

1:16:59.511 --> 1:17:01.180
This is just a film.

1:17:02.348 --> 1:17:04.450
- Thank you.
- And this, the Reboot Camp...

1:17:04.483 --> 1:17:05.652
Thank you.

1:17:05.685 --> 1:17:06.518
Yeah.

1:17:07.419 --> 1:17:09.054
You really are the best.

1:17:09.088 --> 1:17:10.289
No.

1:17:10.322 --> 1:17:11.390
I can't believe
that I made it.

1:17:11.423 --> 1:17:13.058
I made it up, Maisey.

1:17:13.092 --> 1:17:15.561
I've been working so hard
and you've been helping me

1:17:15.594 --> 1:17:16.495
every step of the way.

1:17:16.528 --> 1:17:17.763
I can't believe this.

1:17:17.796 --> 1:17:18.897
And this accent
on you is amazing.

1:17:18.931 --> 1:17:20.766
No, this is me.

1:17:20.799 --> 1:17:24.937
- The other guy was the accent.
- Thank you.

1:17:24.970 --> 1:17:27.439
I approached
two other members.

1:17:27.473 --> 1:17:28.907
Same thing.

1:17:28.941 --> 1:17:30.909
They would not believe me.

1:17:30.943 --> 1:17:32.646
They thought it was
all part of the reboot.

1:17:34.714 --> 1:17:36.582
So I called Claire
in for a meeting.

1:17:36.615 --> 1:17:38.183
How do you
explain Stockholm syndrome?

1:17:38.217 --> 1:17:39.118
They are weak.

1:17:39.151 --> 1:17:40.419
They wanna be told what to do.

1:17:40.452 --> 1:17:42.588
Our product is telling
them what to do.

1:17:42.621 --> 1:17:45.124
Books, videos,
seminars, retreats.

1:17:45.157 --> 1:17:48.360
They pay every antivirus
session, 200 bucks.

1:17:48.394 --> 1:17:50.195
And then, you're
gonna love this.

1:17:50.229 --> 1:17:53.132
We expand the reboot diet

1:17:53.165 --> 1:17:54.967
with fricking
reboot supplements.

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.368
That's genius.

1:17:56.402 --> 1:17:57.336
Well, we're gonna
have to change locations

1:17:57.369 --> 1:17:58.504
'cause it's Cooper's house.

1:17:58.537 --> 1:18:00.439
You can
get acreage for cheap

1:18:00.472 --> 1:18:01.340
around Kagel Canyon.

1:18:01.373 --> 1:18:02.642
We'll build a wellness ranch.

1:18:02.676 --> 1:18:03.710
What do
we do about Cooper?

1:18:03.743 --> 1:18:04.943
About the documentary?

1:18:04.977 --> 1:18:06.646
Don't
worry about Cooper.

1:18:06.680 --> 1:18:11.651
He loved the documentary,
but he loves money even more.

1:18:11.685 --> 1:18:13.852
I say, "Claire, big idea.

1:18:14.721 --> 1:18:15.888
Let's get everyone together,

1:18:15.921 --> 1:18:17.222
make a big announcement
of how we're moving

1:18:17.256 --> 1:18:19.425
to our permanent location.

1:18:20.426 --> 1:18:22.161
And she bought it.

1:18:22.194 --> 1:18:26.498
So, the plan was once she
had everybody out there,

1:18:26.532 --> 1:18:28.534
I would then reveal the truth.

1:18:28.567 --> 1:18:32.071
The problem is, Maisey
spoke to her first.

1:18:33.072 --> 1:18:35.709
Hello, Reboot Campers.

1:18:35.742 --> 1:18:38.544
We have gathered here today
because we have a very big

1:18:38.577 --> 1:18:40.747
and important
announcement to make.

1:18:40.780 --> 1:18:43.582
We have decided to move
our beautiful retreat

1:18:43.615 --> 1:18:45.951
to a permanent new location.

1:18:48.954 --> 1:18:49.789
Thank you.

1:18:50.923 --> 1:18:54.360
We have a very big
secret to reveal today.

1:18:57.062 --> 1:18:58.864
And that secret is...

1:19:04.470 --> 1:19:07.539
Is that this is all
just an illusion.

1:19:08.641 --> 1:19:10.042
My name is not
Gordon St. Pierre.

1:19:10.075 --> 1:19:11.577
It's Seymour Barr.

1:19:12.812 --> 1:19:15.782
And this is just a
documentary film.

1:19:17.216 --> 1:19:18.384
It's not real.

1:19:20.085 --> 1:19:21.887
I mean, I can show
you everything.

1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:24.089
We've got it on tape from
how I came up with the name,

1:19:24.123 --> 1:19:28.762
Gordon St. Pierre,
to this outfit that is definitely not me.

1:19:28.795 --> 1:19:30.129
This is more me.

1:19:31.597 --> 1:19:36.268
And even how we came up with
the whole Reboot Camp idea.

1:19:38.137 --> 1:19:40.640
I'm sorry, but this is a scam.

1:19:41.974 --> 1:19:43.375
So just come with me inside.

1:19:43.409 --> 1:19:44.878
I'm gonna show you
guys some footage

1:19:44.910 --> 1:19:48.147
and you'll understand how
this whole thing went down.

1:19:48.180 --> 1:19:50.582
And again, I'm really sorry.

1:19:52.484 --> 1:19:53.485
Bravo!

1:19:53.519 --> 1:19:54.953
Bravo, Sherpa Gordon.

1:19:54.987 --> 1:19:56.790
- You just blow us away.
- No, no.

1:19:56.823 --> 1:19:59.291
- No, don't listen to her.
- Final reboot.

1:19:59.324 --> 1:20:01.126
- No, no, guys.
- There you go.

1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:02.995
Guys, listen to me.

1:20:03.028 --> 1:20:05.063
- I'm American.
- Thank you so much.

1:20:05.097 --> 1:20:06.432
Let's all give him
a hug. Come on.

1:20:06.465 --> 1:20:07.767
There is no Gordon.

1:20:07.801 --> 1:20:08.668
There is no Sherpa.

1:20:08.701 --> 1:20:09.601
Sherpa!

1:20:09.636 --> 1:20:10.469
Sherpa!

1:20:10.502 --> 1:20:11.403
Sherpa!

1:20:11.437 --> 1:20:12.271
Sherpa!

1:20:12.304 --> 1:20:13.172
Sherpa!

1:20:13.205 --> 1:20:14.072
Sherpa!

1:20:14.106 --> 1:20:14.908
Sherpa!

1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:16.074
- Sherpa!
- No.

1:20:16.108 --> 1:20:17.176
- Sherpa!
- No Sherpa.

1:20:17.209 --> 1:20:18.845
- Sherpa!
- There's no Sherpa.

1:20:18.878 --> 1:20:19.779
- Sherpa!
- Not Sherpa.

1:20:19.813 --> 1:20:20.647
- Sherpa!
- Not Sherpa.

1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:21.513
Sherpa!

1:20:21.547 --> 1:20:22.381
Sherpa!

1:20:23.282 --> 1:20:24.316
You guys, come on.

1:20:24.349 --> 1:20:25.250
Sherpa!

1:20:25.284 --> 1:20:26.585
Sherpa!

1:20:26.618 --> 1:20:27.754
Anita,
what was your reaction

1:20:27.787 --> 1:20:29.354
when you found out
that Gordon was a fake?

1:20:31.156 --> 1:20:33.192
I really wish people
would stop saying that.

1:20:33.225 --> 1:20:34.393
It's so silly.

1:20:35.461 --> 1:20:37.095
I got excited because I knew.

1:20:37.129 --> 1:20:41.099
Something tingled inside
me that said, this is it.

1:20:41.133 --> 1:20:42.167
This is the level up.

1:20:42.201 --> 1:20:43.770
Okay. Let's go.

1:20:43.803 --> 1:20:45.270
Let's power through this.

1:20:45.304 --> 1:20:46.940
Which camera can
I look in? This one?

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:49.341
Go fuck yourself, Sherpa Gordon.

1:20:49.374 --> 1:20:52.478
You took something away from
me that I thought was real,

1:20:52.511 --> 1:20:53.312
and it wasn't.

1:20:58.350 --> 1:20:59.318
That
was the beginning,

1:20:59.351 --> 1:21:00.887
when I was just turning 30.

1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:01.721
Yeah.

1:21:01.754 --> 1:21:03.622
Yeah. Good times.

1:21:03.656 --> 1:21:05.624
We're younger and skinnier.

1:21:06.525 --> 1:21:08.293
A lot skinnier.

1:21:08.327 --> 1:21:09.194
Me.

1:21:09.228 --> 1:21:10.529
You look the same.

1:21:10.562 --> 1:21:12.397
No. Well...

1:21:12.431 --> 1:21:16.535
So anyway, Seymour called
me that night desperate,

1:21:18.938 --> 1:21:20.874
asked me to pick him up.

1:21:20.907 --> 1:21:23.643
Yes, and I told
her everything.

1:21:23.676 --> 1:21:26.044
I didn't show him that
hang in there kitty photo.

1:21:26.078 --> 1:21:27.079
Thank God.

1:21:28.948 --> 1:21:30.382
It's funny that it took
a riff with his brother

1:21:30.415 --> 1:21:32.584
for actually to reconnect.

1:21:34.086 --> 1:21:36.388
So are you
two back together again?

1:21:36.421 --> 1:21:38.023
No, no, no, no.
We're just friends.

1:21:38.056 --> 1:21:39.591
Yeah, just friends.

1:21:39.625 --> 1:21:42.427
But she is paying me back
some of the money she owes me.

1:21:42.461 --> 1:21:44.396
Yes, Grace is a life...

1:21:45.464 --> 1:21:47.065
- Coach.
- Coach, a life coach.

1:21:47.099 --> 1:21:48.267
That's a thing.

1:21:48.300 --> 1:21:49.869
And apparently pays
a lot of money.

1:21:49.903 --> 1:21:51.336
I actually get to use
everything I learned

1:21:51.370 --> 1:21:53.205
at those seminars.

1:21:53.238 --> 1:21:54.406
So it wasn't all bullshit.

1:21:54.439 --> 1:21:56.776
No. Not all of it.

1:21:56.809 --> 1:21:57.710
Just most of it?

1:21:57.744 --> 1:21:58.544
Just a little bit.

1:21:59.946 --> 1:22:02.080
Seymour,
how long has it been

1:22:02.114 --> 1:22:05.150
since you last spoke
to your brother?

1:22:08.788 --> 1:22:10.188
It's been a little while.

1:22:10.222 --> 1:22:11.724
You know, I'm the big brother.

1:22:11.758 --> 1:22:13.458
I should have taken his
side no matter what,

1:22:13.492 --> 1:22:14.661
and I did not.

1:22:16.261 --> 1:22:18.130
It's just, Claire showed
me this bathroom footage

1:22:18.163 --> 1:22:20.232
and it was so incriminating.

1:22:20.265 --> 1:22:21.433
I didn't know what
to do with it.

1:22:21.466 --> 1:22:23.569
I spoke to him recently

1:22:24.904 --> 1:22:28.507
and he doesn't blame
you for what happened.

1:22:31.176 --> 1:22:34.681
I just thought he
should tell you himself.

1:22:36.515 --> 1:22:38.918
Look at this guy.

1:22:38.952 --> 1:22:42.154
That the face of a
cult leader or what?

1:22:42.187 --> 1:22:43.622
You look good, little bro.

1:22:43.656 --> 1:22:44.924
You too, man.

1:22:45.858 --> 1:22:46.693
Oh, dude.

1:22:51.363 --> 1:22:52.564
I'm sorry, man.

1:22:52.598 --> 1:22:55.133
I'm really sorry I let
someone get between us.

1:22:55.167 --> 1:22:56.501
Shut up, man.

1:22:56.535 --> 1:22:58.470
We both fucked up.

1:22:58.503 --> 1:23:00.073
Yeah.

1:23:00.105 --> 1:23:03.843
Danny, do
you maintain your innocence?

1:23:03.876 --> 1:23:05.912
We both ended up
doing the exact opposite

1:23:05.945 --> 1:23:07.579
of what we intended.

1:23:07.613 --> 1:23:09.082
We're both guilty of that.

1:23:09.114 --> 1:23:10.582
No, I
meant recording people

1:23:10.616 --> 1:23:12.085
in the bathroom.

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:14.486
I was played.
Plain and simple.

1:23:14.519 --> 1:23:15.621
Those were my cameras.

1:23:15.655 --> 1:23:16.856
Just wasn't me who planted them.

1:23:16.889 --> 1:23:18.190
Yeah. He was played.

1:23:18.223 --> 1:23:22.028
Come here. I wanna
show you something.

1:23:22.061 --> 1:23:25.130
So, the cult is now
over 300 members.

1:23:27.232 --> 1:23:28.034
Look at this shit.

1:23:30.036 --> 1:23:31.671
Wow.

1:23:31.704 --> 1:23:33.138
Yeah.

1:23:33.171 --> 1:23:34.506
- Crazy.
- Right?

1:23:37.175 --> 1:23:40.046
She calls it the
Reboot Collective.

1:23:40.079 --> 1:23:43.116
It's got a nice
ring to it.

1:23:43.148 --> 1:23:44.383
So brother man.

1:23:44.416 --> 1:23:45.985
Yeah.

1:23:46.019 --> 1:23:50.188
Let's say you and I
finish what we started here.

1:23:51.423 --> 1:23:53.458
- You took the last drive.
- Hell yeah!

1:23:53.492 --> 1:23:56.395
What, did you think I
was gonna leave it there?

1:23:56.428 --> 1:23:58.064
I'm assuming Cooper's
out of the picture.

1:23:58.097 --> 1:24:01.901
Cooper is out, but we have
a new executive producer

1:24:01.934 --> 1:24:03.535
who's much prettier.

1:24:04.837 --> 1:24:05.738
Yeah.

1:24:05.772 --> 1:24:07.205
Grace decided not to pay me back

1:24:07.239 --> 1:24:08.573
the money she owes me in cash,

1:24:08.607 --> 1:24:11.878
but she is funding the
completion of our documentary.

1:24:11.911 --> 1:24:12.745
Wow!

1:24:13.512 --> 1:24:15.247
Thank you. Thank you.

1:24:16.181 --> 1:24:17.349
It's the least I can do.

1:24:17.382 --> 1:24:18.685
I'm a little verklempt
over here.

1:24:27.225 --> 1:24:28.094
Sir?

1:24:28.127 --> 1:24:29.528
Sir, good morning, sir.

1:24:29.561 --> 1:24:31.064
Looking for your
wide emotional baggage?

1:24:31.097 --> 1:24:32.330
No.

1:24:32.364 --> 1:24:34.332
So we found out that
they were proselytizing

1:24:34.366 --> 1:24:36.568
at this supermarket parking lot.

1:24:36.601 --> 1:24:38.938
Now, proselytizing has two
values for cult leaders.

1:24:38.971 --> 1:24:41.373
One, obviously it gets
them new recruits,

1:24:41.406 --> 1:24:44.177
but the other is
the art of pitching

1:24:44.209 --> 1:24:47.180
actually connects the camper
more to the whole thing.

1:24:47.212 --> 1:24:48.413
And here we go.

1:24:50.415 --> 1:24:51.450
We can't talk to you.

1:24:51.483 --> 1:24:52.752
What?

1:24:52.785 --> 1:24:53.786
- Crystal, come on, it's me.
- I'm sorry.

1:24:53.820 --> 1:24:55.021
- Listen.
- We can't talk to you.

1:24:55.054 --> 1:24:55.855
Hey.

1:24:55.888 --> 1:24:56.723
Hey. Hey.

1:25:01.094 --> 1:25:02.929
We approached over 100 people.

1:25:02.962 --> 1:25:06.899
No one wanted to hear what
we had to say.

1:25:14.406 --> 1:25:16.475
Who the fuck is this guy?

1:25:17.442 --> 1:25:18.878
Is he a bodyguard or something?

1:25:18.911 --> 1:25:20.378
She got bodyguards now?

1:25:20.412 --> 1:25:23.548
She got bodyguard? Jesus.

1:25:23.582 --> 1:25:25.651
What is that? Look at this car.

1:25:25.685 --> 1:25:26.819
All right, all right.

1:25:26.853 --> 1:25:28.121
He's taking off.

1:25:28.154 --> 1:25:29.655
Wait, so that's Claire.

1:25:29.689 --> 1:25:30.622
Let's go.

1:25:30.656 --> 1:25:31.556
Holy shit.

1:25:31.590 --> 1:25:32.390
Claire!

1:25:32.424 --> 1:25:33.258
Hey, Claire.

1:25:33.291 --> 1:25:34.093
Claire, can we talk?

1:25:34.127 --> 1:25:35.594
Hey, pervert.

1:25:35.627 --> 1:25:37.562
We even had a drone fly
over and drop off flyers,

1:25:37.596 --> 1:25:38.597
and nothing.

1:25:40.432 --> 1:25:43.803
Did
anyone talk to you?

1:25:43.836 --> 1:25:46.471
Okay, there's someone.

1:25:46.505 --> 1:25:47.439
Who is it?

1:25:47.472 --> 1:25:48.273
Looks like Herbert.

1:25:48.306 --> 1:25:50.143
- Is that Herb?
- Yeah.

1:25:51.309 --> 1:25:53.012
- Hey, Herb.
- Hey, bud.

1:25:54.113 --> 1:25:55.114
How are you?

1:25:56.515 --> 1:25:57.349
Hi.

1:25:58.951 --> 1:26:00.653
What's up, brother?

1:26:02.521 --> 1:26:03.355
Herb.

1:26:05.024 --> 1:26:06.926
How may I help you gentlemen?

1:26:06.959 --> 1:26:08.795
Well, Herb, it's us.

1:26:10.362 --> 1:26:12.031
Thank you, we're
all stocked up here

1:26:12.064 --> 1:26:14.332
and we don't take solicitations.

1:26:14.366 --> 1:26:17.502
No, Herbert it's
me, Seymour and Danny.

1:26:17.536 --> 1:26:18.671
We wanna talk to you, man.

1:26:18.704 --> 1:26:21.506
With all due
respect, I must go.

1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:23.375
Have an enchanted day.

1:26:25.845 --> 1:26:27.280
And love and light.

1:26:27.312 --> 1:26:28.848
- Herbert, come on, man.
- Herb, are you joking?

1:26:28.881 --> 1:26:29.715
Dude...

1:26:30.650 --> 1:26:32.285
It's a scam, Herbert.

1:26:32.317 --> 1:26:33.552
Don't listen to her.

1:26:33.585 --> 1:26:35.688
Herb, it's not real.

1:26:35.721 --> 1:26:37.622
Come on, dude.
Just talk to us.

1:26:37.657 --> 1:26:38.490
Herb.

1:26:43.361 --> 1:26:44.230
He's gone, man.

1:26:44.263 --> 1:26:45.198
Let's just go.

1:26:45.231 --> 1:26:46.565
We'll come back.

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.869
After
everything you went through,

1:26:49.902 --> 1:26:53.072
what is your biggest takeaway?

1:26:53.105 --> 1:26:55.574
Don't hire the
producer's cousin.

1:26:55.607 --> 1:26:57.576
- Niece.
- Niece, cousin, whatever.

1:26:57.609 --> 1:27:00.780
Don't hire any family
members, period.

1:27:02.215 --> 1:27:06.085
To me, we played God
and it bit us in the ass.

1:27:06.118 --> 1:27:09.722
You can't mess with people,
even if it's for a good cause.

1:27:09.755 --> 1:27:13.759
And the irony is, this
documentary is now about us.

1:27:13.793 --> 1:27:17.362
And I think we've proven in
a very painful roundabout way

1:27:17.395 --> 1:27:20.532
that anyone,
including yours truly,

1:27:20.565 --> 1:27:23.035
can fall prey to a
charismatic leader.

1:27:23.069 --> 1:27:25.738
And in the process
we created a cult.

1:27:25.771 --> 1:27:28.975
And in the process
we created a cult.

1:27:30.309 --> 1:27:32.078
In breaking news,

1:27:32.111 --> 1:27:34.113
Gordon St. Pierre
came clean today,

1:27:34.146 --> 1:27:37.415
revealing that
Reboot Camp was fake

1:27:37.449 --> 1:27:40.086
and created to make a
documentary about it.

1:27:40.119 --> 1:27:41.620
While some of his former members

1:27:41.654 --> 1:27:43.455
were upset by this announcement,

1:27:43.488 --> 1:27:45.925
many others still
remain in the camp,

1:27:45.958 --> 1:27:48.895
which is now being led
by a mysterious woman

1:27:48.928 --> 1:27:50.763
who goes by the name of Claire.

1:27:52.331 --> 1:27:54.734
Welcome to the
Reboot Collective.

1:27:54.767 --> 1:27:57.737
A spa for your mind,
a womb for adults,

1:27:57.770 --> 1:27:59.205
where I will
personally guide you

1:27:59.238 --> 1:28:03.242
to become the best version
of your blissful self.

1:28:13.485 --> 1:28:15.087
Claire's a bitch,
Gordon's a god

1:28:15.121 --> 1:28:17.957
and Danny needs
to be a freed man.

1:28:17.990 --> 1:28:20.826
Danny
is not in prison.

1:28:20.860 --> 1:28:21.961
What?

1:28:23.495 --> 1:28:27.099
Are you still
in Claire's Reboot Collective?

1:28:27.133 --> 1:28:28.801
Of course.

1:28:28.834 --> 1:28:31.304
I love Claire. She's awesome.

1:28:32.638 --> 1:28:34.240
I offered Claire my
vagina free of charge

1:28:34.273 --> 1:28:36.142
and she didn't want it.

1:28:40.313 --> 1:28:41.147
Vagina.

1:28:44.951 --> 1:28:47.420
We found a way to reconnect.

1:28:51.157 --> 1:28:54.060
I do not have
time for this shit.

1:28:55.361 --> 1:28:56.594
My time with Gordon is over.

1:28:56.628 --> 1:28:58.097
My time with my father is over,

1:28:58.130 --> 1:29:02.234
and it is time for my time
with my mother, Claire.

1:29:03.202 --> 1:29:05.037
And what would
I say to Claire?

1:29:06.839 --> 1:29:08.007
<i>♪ Hello, my baby ♪</i>

1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:09.675
<i>♪ Hello, my honey ♪</i>

1:29:09.709 --> 1:29:12.645
<i>♪ Hello, my ragtime gal ♪</i>

1:29:12.678 --> 1:29:14.046
Take that, Claire.

1:29:16.514 --> 1:29:18.217
It's a hall of fame vagina.

1:29:18.250 --> 1:29:19.986
I don't get it.

1:29:20.019 --> 1:29:22.688
She should have kept it.

1:29:22.722 --> 1:29:25.725
I feel the power
of enlightenment.

1:29:26.926 --> 1:29:29.295
Fuck that shit, motherfucker.

1:29:29.328 --> 1:29:32.131
Thank
you. I feel the power.

1:29:32.164 --> 1:29:33.466
Right?

1:29:33.498 --> 1:29:34.333
Right?

1:29:35.368 --> 1:29:37.036
It's powerful stuff.

1:29:40.006 --> 1:29:43.075
Trash, just like
this stupid class.

1:29:44.910 --> 1:29:46.012
Where
do you go from here?

1:29:46.045 --> 1:29:48.080
Is it always standing
on a sofa now?

1:29:48.114 --> 1:29:49.547
Well, I have to buy a sofa

1:29:49.581 --> 1:29:51.017
because I don't have a sofa.

1:29:51.050 --> 1:29:55.087
So this where I go from
here is probably the store.

1:29:56.088 --> 1:29:57.256
You gotta get free.

1:29:57.289 --> 1:29:58.224
Yeah?

1:29:58.257 --> 1:30:00.693
So that's what this is about.

1:30:01.694 --> 1:30:04.196
Please, Amazon, get your copy.

1:30:07.199 --> 1:30:09.601
You're with
another self-help group?

1:30:09.635 --> 1:30:11.103
Notmycult.org.

1:30:11.137 --> 1:30:15.107
It's people who've had bad
experiences with groups.

1:30:15.141 --> 1:30:19.211
And, you know, we do like
yoga things in the park

1:30:20.646 --> 1:30:25.051
and we all have these blue,
sky blue shirts that we wear.

1:30:25.084 --> 1:30:28.521
It's really great. It's
been really helpful.

1:30:28.586 --> 1:30:29.922
Can't you-

1:30:29.955 --> 1:30:32.925
Can't you tell how
it has affected me?

1:30:34.326 --> 1:30:36.195
Well, I
never knew you prior to this,

1:30:36.228 --> 1:30:38.297
but you seem happy, enlightened.

1:30:38.330 --> 1:30:40.933
Motherfucker, I used
to be loud and shit.

1:30:40.966 --> 1:30:43.102
Now, I'm like cool, calm.

1:30:45.471 --> 1:30:47.373
You see how quickly
I brought that back?

1:30:47.406 --> 1:30:48.573
- Wow.
- You see what he did?

1:30:48.606 --> 1:30:51.777
This is what the
guru has done for me.

1:30:53.946 --> 1:30:55.915
You see, these cult
leaders are very charming.

1:30:55.948 --> 1:30:57.216
Cult leader?

1:30:57.249 --> 1:30:58.284
Yes.

1:30:58.317 --> 1:30:59.552
It's not a cult. It's a club.

1:30:59.584 --> 1:31:02.088
I don't think
he's even French.

1:31:03.189 --> 1:31:05.057
Yo, how many
producers does it take

1:31:05.091 --> 1:31:05.991
to change a light bulb?

1:31:06.025 --> 1:31:06.859
How many?

1:31:10.796 --> 1:31:11.764
Good answer?

1:31:18.204 --> 1:31:21.240
How many gurus does it take
to change a light bulb?

1:31:21.273 --> 1:31:22.842
Answer?

1:31:22.875 --> 1:31:24.110
None.

1:31:24.143 --> 1:31:27.146
Because change must
come from within.

1:31:29.348 --> 1:31:30.483
Love and light.

I have another joke.

1:32:56.202 --> 1:32:59.872
What do you call a woody
that likes to peck?

1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:02.541
Woody, woodpecker.

1:33:04.610 --> 1:33:07.079
I'm going to work on this one.

1:33:11.450 --> 1:33:12.618
No idea.

1:33:12.652 --> 1:33:14.119
It came out of my ass.

1:33:14.153 --> 1:33:16.222
So we're going to continue
with the vagina jokes

1:33:16.255 --> 1:33:17.657
for your therapy.

1:33:18.791 --> 1:33:22.595
What'd you call a
Roman with a big smile

1:33:22.628 --> 1:33:25.497
and a pubic hair
between the teeth.

1:33:27.733 --> 1:33:29.235
I don't know.

1:33:29.268 --> 1:33:30.269
Gladiator.

1:33:32.171 --> 1:33:33.505
Glad he ate her.

1:33:35.274 --> 1:33:37.610
I have a telephone
call from Mike.

1:33:37.644 --> 1:33:38.744
Mike who?

1:33:38.777 --> 1:33:40.112
Hunt.

1:33:40.145 --> 1:33:40.980
Mike Hunt.

1:33:43.816 --> 1:33:46.252
Telephone call for Mike Hunt.

Okay.

1:33:54.360 --> 1:33:55.194
