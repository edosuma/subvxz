Oh, my.
What a cute beret.

00:41.995 --> 00:43.896
Cute?!
Puppies are cute!

00:43.964 --> 00:46.015
Reese Witherspoon before
children was cute.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.634
Ma'am, this hat symbolizes
the Army's transition

00:48.702 --> 00:50.169
into a 21st-century
fighting force

00:50.237 --> 00:51.854
with the power to slug it out

00:51.938 --> 00:53.422
and win campaigns decisively!

00:53.490 --> 00:56.692
It must be fun
to play an Army guy.

00:56.777 --> 00:58.177
Play?!
Puppies play!

00:58.245 --> 01:00.413
Reese Witherspoon plays
to her strengths

01:00.480 --> 01:02.198
when she takes on
middle-of-the-road

01:02.265 --> 01:04.467
romantic comedies
like <i>Sweet Home Alabama!</i>

01:04.534 --> 01:06.469
Ma'am, Sergeant Pepper
serves his country

01:06.536 --> 01:08.571
in the Army Reserves,
preserving freedom!

01:08.655 --> 01:10.072
No matter how dangerous it gets,

01:10.140 --> 01:11.924
no matter who I have to kill...

Oh, I have to take this.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.625
I love hanging out with your parents.

01:29.693 --> 01:31.026
They were right about my colors.

01:31.094 --> 01:32.328
I am an autumn.

01:32.395 --> 01:34.530
Yeah, my folks are the best.

01:34.598 --> 01:36.499
Hey, Dads.

01:37.968 --> 01:39.668
Why are we pretending to
be his parents again?

01:39.736 --> 01:41.036
Because neither one of us

01:41.104 --> 01:42.738
has anything left
to say to each other.

01:42.806 --> 01:44.039
You know what I'm talking about.

01:44.107 --> 01:45.775
We're bored, and we've
been bored for years.

01:45.842 --> 01:47.276
I know.

01:49.946 --> 01:51.547
Sorry I'm late.

01:51.615 --> 01:54.350
I was in IKEA, and I couldn't
figure out how to leave.

01:54.417 --> 01:56.152
Every path led back
to "Home Office."

01:56.219 --> 01:57.887
It's okay, Dr. Penguin.

01:57.954 --> 02:00.523
I've been feeling
really guilty about...

02:00.590 --> 02:02.091
Hold on.

02:06.129 --> 02:07.263
Well, I've just been...

02:07.330 --> 02:09.965
Oh, hang on.

02:10.032 --> 02:11.700
There we go. Shoot.

02:11.768 --> 02:13.953
Dr. Penguin,
I'm still hiding

02:14.020 --> 02:16.055
my new girlfriend from my mom and dad.

02:16.122 --> 02:17.690
Uh-oh.
That's normal--

02:17.757 --> 02:19.492
a teenager embarrassed of his parents.

02:19.559 --> 02:21.093
It's more than that.

02:21.161 --> 02:22.728
I've actually been
pretending my neighbors,

02:22.796 --> 02:24.530
Greg and Terry, are my parents.

02:24.598 --> 02:26.999
Yes, I know them.
I painted them.

02:29.402 --> 02:31.670
My folks would be devastated
if they knew the truth.

02:31.738 --> 02:33.305
What should I do?

02:35.709 --> 02:38.677
Wow. I am hungrier
than I thought.

02:42.449 --> 02:43.649
And you need to keep lying.

02:43.717 --> 02:44.783
What?!

02:44.851 --> 02:46.085
Eventually, it'll become second nature

02:46.152 --> 02:47.586
and you'll stop feeling guilty.

02:47.654 --> 02:48.921
Okay.

02:48.989 --> 02:50.155
Thanks, Dr. Penguin.

02:50.223 --> 02:51.290
I always feel safe here.

02:51.358 --> 02:52.491
How many times have you

02:52.559 --> 02:54.026
been playing with yourself a day?

02:54.094 --> 02:55.694
Three. We're going to up that to five.

02:55.762 --> 02:57.096
You can take this prescription

02:57.163 --> 02:59.565
to any room in the house
with Kleenex and have it filled.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.166
Thanks, Doc.

03:01.234 --> 03:04.336
Ugh. I can't believe the family
comes to you for therapy.

03:04.404 --> 03:06.272
People shouldn't ignore their emotions

03:06.339 --> 03:07.673
and avoid their problems.

03:07.741 --> 03:09.742
What do you know?
You're just a stupid fish.

03:09.809 --> 03:12.444
I am a man in a fish's body.

03:12.512 --> 03:15.097
I studied psychology
at Frankfurt University!

03:15.165 --> 03:17.199
If they came to me
with their problems,

03:17.267 --> 03:19.735
I could actually help
them, not to mention get

03:19.803 --> 03:22.805
the respect I deserve in this family!

03:22.873 --> 03:24.189
Snow globe!

03:24.257 --> 03:26.842
No! Nooooooo!

03:26.910 --> 03:29.245
I've got a couple more hours
here at the office, honey,

03:29.312 --> 03:31.397
but I'll definitely be home
for dinner.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.032
Babe, I got to go.

03:33.066 --> 03:35.467
Somebody just dropped a bunch
of work on my desk.

03:37.370 --> 03:39.271
What?

03:39.339 --> 03:41.407
I eat here every day before I go home

03:41.474 --> 03:43.375
because I can't stand
my wife's cooking.

03:43.443 --> 03:45.144
What, you never lie to your wife?

03:45.211 --> 03:46.378
Sir, I'm a woman.

03:46.446 --> 03:47.780
Uh, of course you are.

03:47.847 --> 03:49.248
I should have noticed.
You're clearly pregnant.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.316
No, I'm not.

03:50.383 --> 03:51.483
Of course you're not.

03:51.551 --> 03:52.918
You're far too old to be pregnant.

03:52.986 --> 03:54.119
I'm 23.

03:54.187 --> 03:55.638
Well, I would apologize to you

03:55.705 --> 03:57.840
if you didn't look like a fat old man.

03:59.292 --> 04:00.893
It doesn't mean I love her any less.

04:00.961 --> 04:02.261
It's just her food, right?

04:02.329 --> 04:04.196
Of course.
What's important here

04:04.264 --> 04:06.665
is to avoid the truth at all costs.

04:06.733 --> 04:08.901
I've always said,
"What's important here

04:08.969 --> 04:10.836
is to avoid the truth
at all costs."

04:10.904 --> 04:12.738
Jeff, we're ready for you.

04:14.107 --> 04:15.474
Hey.

04:15.542 --> 04:16.942
Hi.

04:22.382 --> 04:24.249
Whenever Hayley wants to have sex,

04:24.317 --> 04:26.652
I have to think about Francine.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.170
It's the only way I can get excited.

04:28.238 --> 04:30.339
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:30.407 --> 04:32.074
Jeff, do you have belly hair?

04:32.142 --> 04:33.575
What? We'll circle back, Jeff.

04:33.643 --> 04:35.945
My advice to you is to stop
worrying about it.

04:36.012 --> 04:37.746
Ugh. What?!

04:37.814 --> 04:39.748
It's natural to think about Francine

04:39.816 --> 04:41.083
when you're sleeping with Hayley.

04:41.151 --> 04:42.685
No!
That's terrible advice!

04:42.752 --> 04:45.087
What people don't know
can't hurt them.

04:45.155 --> 04:46.989
Oh, you're so
wise, Dr. P.

04:47.057 --> 04:48.958
No! Listen to me!

04:49.025 --> 04:50.859
Relationships are much stronger

04:50.927 --> 04:53.462
when they are based
on truth and honesty.

04:54.998 --> 04:57.099
Punch a fish, make a wish.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.435
Can Cost Plus make something

04:59.502 --> 05:02.571
that doesn't smell funny
and break two days later?

05:05.375 --> 05:07.409
So nice of you to have me to dinner.

05:07.477 --> 05:09.278
I don't ordinarily
dine with my patients.

05:09.346 --> 05:11.313
I tend to suck on food erotically,

05:11.381 --> 05:12.881
and it makes people uncomfortable.

05:12.949 --> 05:14.817
Lentils are ready.

05:17.687 --> 05:19.922
Delicious!

05:23.877 --> 05:24.994
Mail came.

05:25.061 --> 05:26.628
I'm going to eat after I do my miles.

05:32.986 --> 05:34.953
Mmm! Mmm. Mmm.

05:35.021 --> 05:36.588
Who's Sergeant Pepper?

05:37.857 --> 05:39.458
Well, thank you for a lovely evening.

05:39.526 --> 05:41.326
I see you didn't open
the wine I brought,

05:41.394 --> 05:43.412
so I am taking it with me.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.131
Just drinking a nice young
Beaujolais with the boys.

05:46.182 --> 05:47.332
Heard I got some mail.

05:49.569 --> 05:51.136
Oh. I see.

05:51.204 --> 05:52.371
It's happened.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.173
I've been called on to serve.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.308
What? Where?
In Iraq.

05:56.376 --> 05:58.277
Oh, no!
It's all right, ma'am.

05:58.344 --> 06:00.813
That's what all that
training was for, I suppose.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.149
Say your prayers, Iraqis,
and I'll say mine.

06:04.217 --> 06:05.951
Ow! I stepped
on that glass!

06:06.019 --> 06:08.387
I stepped on that
mother-lovin' glass!

06:08.455 --> 06:10.489
You're all sued when I get back!

06:10.557 --> 06:12.424
Wait. Can I still see
Dr. Penguin?

06:12.492 --> 06:14.259
If Pepper's going to Iraq,

06:14.327 --> 06:16.628
I think it's pretty
obvious that Dr. Penguin

06:16.696 --> 06:19.698
will be staying with his
Aunt Evelyn for a while.

06:20.934 --> 06:22.551
Wait. You can't
go to Iraq.

06:22.619 --> 06:24.219
I'm still lying to Jeff

06:24.287 --> 06:26.188
about where I go
when I say I'm jogging.

06:26.272 --> 06:28.357
I need Dr. Penguin
to tell me it's fine.

06:28.441 --> 06:30.826
No can do.
It's official.

06:34.114 --> 06:36.432
Bye-bye, Dr. Penguin!

06:36.499 --> 06:39.768
Dr. Klaus is in the house.

06:39.836 --> 06:43.272
Well, who else shall I send to Iraq?

06:43.339 --> 06:47.142
That jerk at the dry cleaners
who lost my tie.

06:50.897 --> 06:52.881
How could this happen?

06:52.949 --> 06:54.983
You're not even in the Reserves.

06:55.051 --> 06:57.276
Don't worry. I know a place
where they'll never find me.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:10.298 --> 07:12.701
Shh...

07:20.777 --> 07:22.340
Save your tears, maggots.

07:22.460 --> 07:24.646
I'm off to Iraq to
preserve your freedom.

07:24.823 --> 07:27.458
Keep you in two-ply
toilet paper and soy milk.

07:27.526 --> 07:30.027
You pansies make me sick!

07:30.095 --> 07:31.262
Mmm.
Mmm, mmm.

07:31.329 --> 07:32.496
Wait for me.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.201
Good day to everyone.

07:37.269 --> 07:39.803
I just wanted to say
that I will be taking over

07:39.871 --> 07:42.106
Dr. Penguin's practice
while he's away.

07:42.174 --> 07:43.574
You can't just put on glasses

07:43.642 --> 07:45.276
and pretend to be a doctor, Klaus.

07:45.343 --> 07:48.245
The glasses are prescription,
and I am not pretending.

07:48.313 --> 07:50.147
Ugh. Stop talking, fish.

07:50.215 --> 07:52.149
I am not a fish.

07:52.217 --> 07:54.752
I am a man in a fish's body.

07:54.819 --> 07:56.820
Look, all of you have serious issues,

07:56.888 --> 07:58.622
and I can help you.

07:58.690 --> 08:01.792
Now, I will have office hours
in the attic from 9:00 to 5:00.

08:04.162 --> 08:05.462
Or whenever.

08:05.530 --> 08:06.897
Any time is good.

08:06.965 --> 08:07.998
If you can't find me,

08:08.066 --> 08:08.999
check the pantry.

08:09.067 --> 08:10.067
I go in there

08:10.135 --> 08:11.101
to eat baking chocolate

08:11.169 --> 08:12.336
and cry sometimes.

08:15.907 --> 08:17.741
Can you help me, Klaus?

08:24.749 --> 08:26.984
Of course I can help you.

08:27.052 --> 08:29.019
I can't find my phone.
Have you seen it?

08:29.087 --> 08:30.387
Ph-Phone?!

08:30.455 --> 08:33.057
But what about the lies
you tell your husband?

08:33.124 --> 08:34.225
Oh, wait.

08:34.292 --> 08:36.059
I left it in the kitchen.

08:42.734 --> 08:45.436
You hear an IED
blew a troop transport

08:45.503 --> 08:46.937
over on its side yesterday?
Yes, Sergeant.

08:47.022 --> 08:48.872
On the got-dang
main road.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.407
Till they get a Boomerang

08:50.475 --> 08:52.343
anti-sniper system on
that son of a bitch,

08:52.410 --> 08:54.545
I'd rather drag ass through
the streets on foot.

08:54.613 --> 08:56.380
Uh, Sarge, the bot isn't working.

08:56.448 --> 08:57.848
It stopped halfway to the target.

09:04.189 --> 09:05.422
I'm suiting up.

09:05.507 --> 09:06.473
But, sir, don't you think...

09:06.541 --> 09:07.608
I don't think.

09:07.676 --> 09:08.943
That's why I'm the perfect soldier.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.911
And the perfect guy
to watch movies with.

09:10.979 --> 09:13.297
I don't poke holes.
I just enjoy the ride.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.518
Give me some sizzle.

09:26.745 --> 09:28.929
I'm going in on foot.

09:43.461 --> 09:46.397
He is the ballsiest
outhouse cleaner we got.

09:46.464 --> 09:49.099
Let's do this.

09:53.221 --> 09:54.855
Oh, we got a meat clog, Private.

09:54.923 --> 09:56.857
Up the suction.

09:59.661 --> 10:01.729
No one showed up
to my office hours, Charlie.

10:01.796 --> 10:05.332
I... I just can't get them
to take me seriously.

10:06.801 --> 10:09.353
Why, that's good advice, Charlie.

10:09.421 --> 10:11.422
I'll... I'll try that.

10:11.489 --> 10:13.741
What?
Now, that's strange.

10:13.808 --> 10:16.143
Did you wait three days
to cash it like I asked you?

10:16.211 --> 10:17.745
Because I have the money.

10:17.812 --> 10:20.814
I have, like, way more money
than that, even.

10:22.684 --> 10:25.519
I don't have very much money.

10:27.922 --> 10:30.507
Here we go.

10:30.575 --> 10:33.444
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

10:33.511 --> 10:35.245
Hello, Stan.

10:35.313 --> 10:36.914
What now?

10:36.981 --> 10:39.049
What now?
Oh, nothing.

10:39.117 --> 10:42.753
Just that Steve has a girlfriend
he hasn't introduced you to.

10:42.821 --> 10:45.122
What? He doesn't
have a girlfriend.

10:45.190 --> 10:47.057
He does.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.293
He's so embarrassed
of you and Francine

10:49.361 --> 10:51.962
that he's pretending
Greg and Terry are his parents.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.814
Look, there they are now,

10:53.882 --> 10:55.549
acting out <i>Rocky Horror.</i>

11:00.422 --> 11:02.122
Francine, get in here.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.224
What happened?
Did I win?

11:04.292 --> 11:06.160
Steve is pretending that Greg
and Terry are his parents!

11:06.227 --> 11:07.494
What?

11:07.545 --> 11:09.446
That little son of a b's
got a girlfriend

11:09.514 --> 11:11.315
and he's hiding us from her
because he's embarrassed.

11:11.383 --> 11:13.434
You should
talk to a professional.

11:13.501 --> 11:15.069
Now, my office hours
are 9:00 to--

11:15.136 --> 11:16.754
That four-eyed bastard!

11:16.838 --> 11:19.390
That malnourished, pasty geek!

11:19.457 --> 11:21.592
I knew I should've aborted him.

11:21.659 --> 11:22.726
Goodness!

11:26.398 --> 11:27.898
How you doing in there, Sarge?

11:27.966 --> 11:30.717
It's 110 in here
and I'm on the wrong end

11:30.769 --> 11:32.686
of a falafel plate,
that's how I'm doing.

11:32.754 --> 11:35.139
Damn it!
The Shnozzle attachment fell in.

11:36.991 --> 11:38.325
I don't like
this, it's too quiet.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.193
Get outta there, Sarge.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.994
Just need a few more seconds...

11:46.835 --> 11:48.268
Oh.

11:48.336 --> 11:49.236
Sarge, don't go in!

11:49.304 --> 11:50.204
It's not worth it!

11:59.731 --> 12:01.632
We got a native inbound!

12:01.699 --> 12:02.699
Come on! Get outta there.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.435
Oh, man! Oh, man!

12:04.502 --> 12:05.836
Maybe he's just going number one.

12:05.904 --> 12:10.441
He's got a magazine!

12:10.508 --> 12:13.377
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

12:23.922 --> 12:25.689
We know you have a girlfriend!

12:25.757 --> 12:27.791
Me?! A girlfriend?!

12:27.859 --> 12:29.393
Isn't that a little far fetched?

12:29.461 --> 12:30.794
It is a little far fetched...

12:30.862 --> 12:32.196
You just saw her, Stan!

12:32.263 --> 12:33.597
I just saw her, Steve!

12:33.665 --> 12:34.765
Klaus, what the hell?!

12:34.833 --> 12:36.066
What the hell, you!

12:36.134 --> 12:38.619
Tell them how you feel, Steve.

12:38.686 --> 12:40.387
I feel like I can't
bring anyone around here

12:40.455 --> 12:41.672
'cause Dad's a lunatic!

12:41.756 --> 12:43.073
And if he doesn't drive 'em away,

12:43.141 --> 12:44.708
Mom's food will probably kill them!

12:44.776 --> 12:46.059
How dare you!

12:46.127 --> 12:47.478
I'm a great cook!

12:47.545 --> 12:49.046
Yes! The best!
So much!

12:49.113 --> 12:52.866
Come on, Stan, it's
your turn to be honest.

12:52.934 --> 12:55.269
Leaving work at
4:00 every day...

12:55.336 --> 12:56.737
the pre-eating...

12:56.804 --> 12:58.205
What's he talking about?

12:58.273 --> 13:00.507
Sometimes I'll have
a snack before dinner...

13:00.575 --> 13:02.009
Your cooking goes <i>here!</i>

13:04.913 --> 13:07.598
He hasn't eaten a meal
of yours in ten years!

13:07.665 --> 13:10.200
Some of these wolves
are fourth generation!

13:10.268 --> 13:11.802
Inbred dinner wolves!

13:11.870 --> 13:13.203
This is what I'm talking about!

13:13.271 --> 13:14.671
Embarrassing!

13:14.739 --> 13:17.007
Stan, you have some nerve!

13:17.075 --> 13:18.342
Francine.

13:18.409 --> 13:20.494
The "emergency fund?"

13:20.562 --> 13:22.246
Wait, wait, wait,
what's the emergency fund?

13:22.313 --> 13:25.682
So I take $50 from
your wallet every week.

13:25.750 --> 13:26.884
For...

13:26.951 --> 13:28.151
Drugs.

13:28.219 --> 13:29.853
What?!
Drugs.

13:29.921 --> 13:32.055
Drugs, okay?

13:32.123 --> 13:33.840
Jeff and Hayley, come in.

13:33.892 --> 13:36.810
We're undoing years of damage
caused by Dr. Penguin.

13:36.878 --> 13:39.079
Come on, Jeff, out with it.

13:39.147 --> 13:40.430
No way.

13:40.498 --> 13:42.766
I'll start you off and you finish.

13:42.834 --> 13:46.870
Hayley, Jeff can only
have sex with you if...

13:46.938 --> 13:48.772
if...

13:48.840 --> 13:50.290
he's thinking about your mother.

13:50.358 --> 13:52.359
Oops, I said the whole thing.

13:52.427 --> 13:53.760
That's sick!

13:53.828 --> 13:55.762
Hayley, you should be honest about

13:55.830 --> 13:58.865
what you really do
when you go "jogging."

13:58.933 --> 14:00.100
You shut your mouth.

14:00.168 --> 14:02.102
She's playing Ultimate
Frisbee without you.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.870
Noooo!

14:03.938 --> 14:05.706
Why, Hayley?!
Why?!

14:05.773 --> 14:07.007
Because this is you throwing.

14:07.075 --> 14:08.041
"Ehh."

14:08.109 --> 14:09.176
And this is you catching.

14:09.244 --> 14:10.310
"Ahh!"

14:10.378 --> 14:12.246
That's wonderful mime work!

14:12.313 --> 14:15.749
I guess you're just
good at everything!

14:15.817 --> 14:18.085
Jeff, wait! Now that
the truth is out,

14:18.152 --> 14:21.021
we need to discuss ways for you
and Hayley to regain intimacy!

14:21.089 --> 14:22.456
Yeah, Jeff, come back.

14:22.523 --> 14:23.924
I came out of your favorite place.

14:23.992 --> 14:25.692
Maybe you can still smell it on me!

14:25.760 --> 14:29.096
I guess Jeff gets turned on
by thieves, huh, Francine?

14:29.163 --> 14:31.365
Shut up, you pre-eating
douche bag!

14:31.432 --> 14:35.469
Okay, guys, guys, if we do the
work, we can get through this...

14:35.536 --> 14:37.387
This is why I don't bring
my girlfriend home!

14:37.455 --> 14:39.373
You know what they're doing
at my two dads' house?

14:39.440 --> 14:40.741
Eating cheeses!

14:40.808 --> 14:41.694
From Europe!

14:41.814 --> 14:43.398
Sans crackers!

14:43.518 --> 14:45.860
That's right, I said a French word!

14:45.913 --> 14:47.614
I learned it over there!

14:47.682 --> 14:49.483
<i>Au revoir, les enfants!</i>

14:49.550 --> 14:51.715
That means  you!

14:51.950 --> 14:55.489
Well, this feels like
a natural stopping point.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.126
Aah! Stop it, Stan!

15:09.246 --> 15:10.736
You destroyed my family!

15:10.856 --> 15:13.252
But if you would all just
listen to me, I could fix it!

15:13.381 --> 15:15.382
The only one who can fix
this is Dr. Penguin!

15:15.450 --> 15:17.417
Ow, okay, fine!

15:17.485 --> 15:20.504
For some reason, Roger is the
only therapist you'll listen to!

15:20.571 --> 15:22.072
I'll get him back!

15:22.140 --> 15:24.910
How the hell is a fish going to
get an alien back from Iraq?

15:38.126 --> 15:39.389
Where's Sergeant Pepper?

15:39.457 --> 15:40.724
Are you in the Army?

15:40.792 --> 15:42.159
Are you in the dummy?

15:42.226 --> 15:43.360
Now where's Pepper?

15:43.428 --> 15:44.961
He's in the Rec Tent.

15:45.029 --> 15:48.432
If you ever need some bitches,
remember, White James.

15:54.989 --> 15:56.923
You Sergeant Pepper?

15:56.991 --> 15:59.209
You the one who cleaned
the toilet by the grotto?

15:59.277 --> 16:00.761
Uh, uh, yes, sir.

16:00.828 --> 16:02.763
You're a wild man, you know that?

16:02.830 --> 16:04.564
He's a wild man, you know that?

16:04.632 --> 16:06.283
I wanna shake your hand.

16:06.350 --> 16:07.517
Thank you, sir.

16:07.602 --> 16:09.836
How many toilets have you cleaned?

16:09.904 --> 16:10.871
I'm not quite sure...

16:10.938 --> 16:12.806
Sergeant, I asked you a question.

16:12.857 --> 16:14.291
Eight hundred and seventy-three.

16:14.358 --> 16:18.161
Eight hundred...
and seventy-three.

16:18.229 --> 16:19.529
That has to be a record.

16:19.597 --> 16:22.232
What's the best way to clean
one of them stink holes?

16:22.300 --> 16:24.601
The way that you don't get
turd in your hair, sir.

16:24.669 --> 16:27.804
That's a good one.

16:27.872 --> 16:29.740
Spoken like a wild man.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.876
Sergeant Pepper.

16:32.944 --> 16:34.745
You've been officially discharged.

16:36.581 --> 16:37.931
Nothin' doin'.

16:37.999 --> 16:40.500
I can't fit in with
civilized society no more!

16:40.568 --> 16:42.068
When I go to bed at night,

16:42.136 --> 16:44.855
I see men hovering over me with
their naked asses in my face.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.389
I'm not ready to leave that.

16:48.493 --> 16:49.693
Ugh, bring me up!

16:49.761 --> 16:52.462
Let me talk to him!

16:52.530 --> 16:54.197
But you have to come back!

16:54.265 --> 16:56.500
I ruined the family!

16:56.567 --> 16:58.635
They need Dr. Penguin!

16:58.703 --> 17:01.004
Tough Titicacas.

17:01.072 --> 17:03.206
What now, White James?

17:03.274 --> 17:05.909
You always think of something, Klaus.

17:05.977 --> 17:07.243
Like when you convinced my parents

17:07.328 --> 17:08.595
to let me go to art school.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.339
Good-bye,
Sergeant Pepper.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.503
What am I doing here?!

17:33.571 --> 17:35.505
This isn't a Chablis.

17:35.573 --> 17:36.840
This isn't my aunt's place!

17:36.908 --> 17:38.108
Aunt Evelyn?!

17:38.176 --> 17:39.810
Aunt Evelyn!
It's me, Rafael!

17:39.877 --> 17:41.344
Rafael Penguin!

17:41.412 --> 17:43.013
Good morning,
Dr. Penguin.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.214
Ready to come home?

17:46.584 --> 17:48.185
Hold onto your wallets.

17:48.252 --> 17:49.252
Thief's in the room.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.253
Cute.

17:50.321 --> 17:52.289
If you even look at her,

17:52.356 --> 17:54.558
I'll pour this hot coffee
down your pants, pervert.

17:54.625 --> 17:55.892
Yeah, well, it'll be the first time

17:55.960 --> 17:58.211
you got me hot in
a while, Frisbee whore.

17:58.279 --> 18:00.163
Oh, look who it is.

18:00.231 --> 18:01.748
The ungrateful son.

18:01.816 --> 18:03.683
Leave me alone, embarrassing
straight parents

18:03.751 --> 18:05.185
or I'll pee in your cereal!

18:05.253 --> 18:06.586
Oh, good, you're all here!

18:06.654 --> 18:08.588
I have a surprise for you!

18:08.656 --> 18:11.358
What's black and white
and lives in Antarctica?!

18:11.425 --> 18:13.360
Halle Berry if she
moves to Antarctica?

18:13.427 --> 18:16.162
No, but that's funny.

18:16.230 --> 18:17.163
Very funny.

18:17.231 --> 18:19.165
It's Dr. Penguin!

18:19.233 --> 18:21.017
Dr. Penguin!
You're back!

18:21.085 --> 18:22.152
Oh, thank god!
Help us!

18:22.220 --> 18:23.453
Don't worry, don't worry.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.088
Klaus filled me in on
the whole situation.

18:25.156 --> 18:26.606
Here's what you all have to do.

18:28.743 --> 18:30.560
Everybody go back to
lying to each other.

18:31.562 --> 18:32.646
That's not going to work.

18:32.713 --> 18:34.231
The secrets are all out in the open.

18:34.298 --> 18:35.398
We can't just forget them.

18:35.466 --> 18:36.600
Oh.

18:36.667 --> 18:37.834
Well.
That's my only thing.

18:37.919 --> 18:39.002
I can't help you.

18:39.070 --> 18:41.120
I guess I'm done
with Dr. Penguin.

18:41.172 --> 18:45.442
Okay, now we can deal with our
problems the healthy way...

18:45.509 --> 18:47.978
Suck it, fish!

18:48.045 --> 18:50.397
There! You hot and bothered now?
Take that!

18:50.464 --> 18:52.566
That hot enough for you, Jeff?
Whoa, oops!

18:52.633 --> 18:56.636
Time to catch up on current events.

18:56.704 --> 18:59.923
Oh, I see Taye Diggs
is still perfect looking.

18:59.991 --> 19:02.459
That's comforting.

19:02.526 --> 19:03.793
He's my constant.

19:03.861 --> 19:05.729
My ebony North Star.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.364
Ach! I give up!

19:07.431 --> 19:08.598
What was that?
I wasn't listening.

19:08.666 --> 19:10.100
See! That is the problem.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.835
No one listens to me.

19:11.903 --> 19:13.970
But now that their secrets are out,

19:14.038 --> 19:16.573
they have to work through
them so they can heal!

19:16.641 --> 19:20.110
Wait, that actually makes sense.

19:20.177 --> 19:22.646
Maybe because I was looking
at <i>US Weekly</i> and not you.

19:22.713 --> 19:24.314
I heard the words,

19:24.382 --> 19:26.650
but I didn't see them coming
out of a stupid fish's mouth.

19:26.717 --> 19:28.101
Say something else.

19:28.169 --> 19:31.004
Why is there a hole in
Daniel Craig's mouth?

19:31.072 --> 19:32.939
He was hungry and I was
feeding him something.

19:33.007 --> 19:34.541
Put down that magazine!

19:36.310 --> 19:37.777
I did it!

19:37.845 --> 19:39.546
That's the first time
I've listened to you.

19:39.614 --> 19:45.218
Maybe it's because it me from
a man and not from a fish...

19:45.286 --> 19:46.653
I have an idea!

19:48.255 --> 19:49.356
Listen up, maggots!

19:49.423 --> 19:51.341
You people have major issues.

19:51.409 --> 19:53.777
You can't run from
them all your lives.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.028
You need to face your problems!

19:55.079 --> 19:56.062
But...

19:57.365 --> 19:58.665
You, sack up and eat your wife's grub!

19:58.733 --> 20:00.800
And you missy, you take
your emergency fund

20:00.868 --> 20:02.802
and sign up for a cooking class!

20:02.870 --> 20:04.204
And you, bring your
girlfriend to dinner!

20:04.271 --> 20:06.106
Be grateful you have
two parents who love you!

20:06.173 --> 20:07.874
And that you don't come
from a broken home

20:07.942 --> 20:09.042
like Reese Witherspoon's kids.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.211
Damn I love that girl!
Plucky!

20:11.278 --> 20:13.196
And you, gussy up for your husband!

20:13.264 --> 20:15.632
Maybe some sort of bra?!
And wash your hair.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.067
Hippies are not sexy, they're dirty!

20:17.134 --> 20:18.551
Exactly!

20:18.602 --> 20:21.271
And you, if you're tossing
it to your mother-in-law

20:21.339 --> 20:22.656
it damn well better be a Frisbee!

20:22.723 --> 20:24.724
Sir, yes, sir!

20:24.792 --> 20:27.093
Hey, no one is dismissed!

20:27.161 --> 20:28.862
Not until you thank this fish!

20:28.929 --> 20:30.630
These are all his ideas!

20:30.698 --> 20:32.799
I'm just an authoritative mouthpiece!

20:34.535 --> 20:37.137
Are these really all your ideas?

20:37.204 --> 20:38.705
<i>Ja,</i> they are.

20:38.773 --> 20:40.106
Wow.

20:40.174 --> 20:42.108
Sorry we didn't listen to you.

20:42.176 --> 20:44.978
Sometimes we forget you are
a man in a fish's body.

20:45.046 --> 20:48.448
Oh, it feels so good
to finally be validated.

20:48.516 --> 20:50.617
How can we ever thank you?

20:52.219 --> 20:54.187
Take your pick, Klaus.

20:54.255 --> 20:56.656
Your family paid for
a full quarter hour.

20:56.724 --> 20:58.558
Eh...

20:58.626 --> 20:59.859
I'll take the ugly one.

21:01.962 --> 21:07.233
Time for Klaus to show how
much of a man he really is.

21:08.836 --> 21:11.302
I'm not very much of a man!
