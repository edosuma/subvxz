WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.850
.. know us by these colours for thy foes.

00:02.900 --> 00:05.550
This pale and angry rose...

00:05.600 --> 00:09.600
As symbol white of my blood-drinking hate.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.250
Welcome, Queen Margaret.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.000
My King.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.550
Civil dissension is a viperous worm,

00:22.600 --> 00:25.600
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.550
I am far better born than is the King,

00:30.600 --> 00:33.600
That gold should round
engirt these brows of mine.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.550
Call forth our troops and
bid them arm themselves!

00:38.600 --> 00:41.600
We shall return to wear our crown.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.550
Boys!

00:45.600 --> 00:47.600
Edward. George.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.550
And... Richard!

01:49.600 --> 01:52.550
My Lord! Your Highness...

01:52.600 --> 01:54.550
The Duke of York with Warwick has set out

01:54.600 --> 01:57.550
And with a puissant and a mighty power

01:57.600 --> 01:59.550
Is marching hitherward in proud array.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.550
They will be here by morning.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.550
Where is the Queen?

02:04.600 --> 02:08.000
She's with the Duke of Somerset within.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.600
O...

02:19.600 --> 02:22.600
.. could this kiss be printed in thy hand.

02:30.600 --> 02:35.550
A wilderness is populous enough,

02:35.600 --> 02:37.550
If I but had thy heavenly company.

02:37.600 --> 02:43.550
For where thou art, there
is the world itself,

02:43.600 --> 02:48.600
And where thou art not, desolation.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.600
Yield or die, Somerset.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.000
Father!

04:13.600 --> 04:16.550
Base Suffolk!

04:16.600 --> 04:18.470
Warwick calls!

04:19.600 --> 04:25.550
Suffolk, I say, come
forth and fight with me!

04:25.600 --> 04:27.600
Suffolk!

04:34.600 --> 04:39.600
For one or both of us the time is come.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.550
Hold, Warwick, seek you
out some other chase,

04:56.600 --> 05:00.600
For I myself must hunt this deer to death.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.600
Then, nobly, York; 'tis
for a crown thou fight'st.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.600
Come, Suffolk. Defend thy rose!

06:03.600 --> 06:05.940
I know thee, Somerset.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.550
Obscure and lowly swain, away.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.550
The honourable blood of Lancaster

06:13.600 --> 06:16.550
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.

06:16.600 --> 06:22.550
Thou kennel, puddle, sink,
whose filth and dirt

06:22.600 --> 06:25.550
Trouble the silver spring
where England drinks.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.550
Thy lips that kissed the
Queen shall sweep the ground

06:30.600 --> 06:34.550
For now the House of York
Burns with revenging fire.

06:34.600 --> 06:39.550
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.550
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.600
Ay, but my deeds shall stay thy fury soon.

06:48.600 --> 06:54.600
What, are ye daunted
now? Now will ye stoop?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
True nobility is exempt from fear.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.550
Come, show what cruelty thou can'st,

07:03.600 --> 07:09.600
That this my death may never be forgot.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
Father!

07:28.600 --> 07:30.670
Where's my father?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.070
Suffolk!

07:34.600 --> 07:36.550
Where's the Duke of Suffolk?

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
Father!

08:08.600 --> 08:13.550
O, let the vile world end

08:13.600 --> 08:16.550
And the promised flames of the last day

08:16.600 --> 08:19.470
Knit earth and heaven together!

08:25.600 --> 08:28.550
Even at this sight

08:28.600 --> 08:31.600
My heart is turned to stone.

08:37.600 --> 08:42.600
Henceforth I will not
have to do with pity.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.600
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.140
Somerset!

08:56.600 --> 08:58.140
Somerset!

09:02.600 --> 09:04.600
Somerset!

09:10.600 --> 09:12.600
Somerset!

09:53.600 --> 09:57.600
Think, Margaret, on
revenge and cease to weep.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.600
But who can cease to
weep and look on this?

10:12.600 --> 10:14.550
My hope is gone.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.470
Alas, my Queen.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.550
I fear me, love, if that I were dead

10:27.600 --> 10:30.900
Thou wouldst not mourn so much for me.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.550
Margaret...

10:33.600 --> 10:39.600
God, our hope, will succour us.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.340
Come, we must away from here.

10:49.600 --> 10:55.550
We shall to London get,
where you are loved

10:55.600 --> 11:00.550
And where this breach
now in our fortunes made

11:00.600 --> 11:03.000
May readily be stopped.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.550
Now, by my sword, thou
hast fought well today.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.550
So have we all.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.550
There is one old supporter of the King

11:25.600 --> 11:28.550
Is either slain or wounded dangerously.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.550
That this is true,
father, behold his blood.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.600
Why, that's my son!

11:36.600 --> 11:41.550
Did anyone see or hear
The fate of Somerset,

11:41.600 --> 11:44.550
The foulest canker of the blood-red rose?

11:44.600 --> 11:48.550
My Lord of York, here
is the Duke of Somerset,

11:48.600 --> 11:51.600
Who I encountered ere the battle joined.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.600
Speak thou for me and
tell them what I did.

12:01.550 --> 12:02.550
What? Is Your Grace dead,
my Lord of Somerset?

12:02.600 --> 12:06.550
What? Is Your Grace dead,
my Lord of Somerset?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.200
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head!

12:12.600 --> 12:15.550
If it be true the King has fled to London,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.550
We will pursue him there.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.550
Sound drum and trumpets,
and to London all,

12:20.600 --> 12:24.600
And more such days as these to us befall!

13:13.550 --> 13:14.550
Richard!

13:14.600 --> 13:16.600
Son!

13:26.600 --> 13:28.600
Richard!

14:19.600 --> 14:23.550
This is the palace of the fearful King,

14:23.600 --> 14:24.550
And this the regal seat.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.550
Possess it, York,

14:26.600 --> 14:29.600
For this is thine and
not King Henry's heirs'.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.550
Assist me, then, sweet
Warwick, and I will.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.600
We'll all assist you;
he that flies shall die.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.550
Thanks, gentle Vernon.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.550
Stay by me, then, my Lords.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.550
And when the King comes,
offer him no violence,

14:46.600 --> 14:50.550
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.550
The Queen this day here
holds her parliament,

14:53.600 --> 14:57.550
But little thinks we
shall be of her council.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.550
By words and blows here
let us claim our right.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.550
The "Bloody Parliament"
shall it be called,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.550
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be King,

15:08.600 --> 15:11.550
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice

15:11.600 --> 15:14.550
Hath made us bywords to our enemies.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.600
Then leave me not, my Lords, be resolute.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.900
I mean to take possession of my right.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.550
Neither the King

15:29.600 --> 15:32.550
nor he that loves him best

15:32.600 --> 15:35.550
Dares stir a wing if
Warwick shake his bells.

15:35.600 --> 15:41.600
And I'll plant Plantagenet,
root him up who dares.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.600
My son!

15:49.600 --> 15:52.270
York and Warwick are here...

15:55.600 --> 15:59.600
Resolve thee, Richard;
claim the English crown.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.600
Look where the sturdy rebel stands.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.550
What, shall we suffer this?

16:12.600 --> 16:13.550
Let's pluck him down.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.600
My heart for anger
burns; I cannot brook it!

16:18.600 --> 16:20.550
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.550
My gracious Lord, here in the Parliament

16:22.600 --> 16:24.550
Let us assail the family of York.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.550
Far be the thought of
it from Henry's heart

16:26.600 --> 16:28.550
To make a shambles of
the Parliament-House.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.550
Know you not the city favours them,

16:30.600 --> 16:32.550
And they have troops of
soldiers at their beck?

16:32.600 --> 16:35.550
But when the Duke is slain,
they will quickly fly.

16:35.600 --> 16:40.550
Cousin of Exeter, frowns,
words and threats

16:40.600 --> 16:42.550
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.550
Thou, factious Duke of
York, descend my throne

16:46.600 --> 16:50.600
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet.

16:52.550 --> 16:53.550
I am thy sovereign.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
I am thine.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.550
For shame, come down.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.550
He made thee Duke of York.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.550
It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.550
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.550
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown,

17:15.599 --> 17:17.550
In following this usurping Henry.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.550
Whom should he follow
but his natural King?

17:19.599 --> 17:23.550
True, Clifford, and that's
Richard, Duke of York.

17:23.599 --> 17:27.550
And shall I stand, and
thou sit in my throne?

17:27.599 --> 17:30.550
It must and shall be so.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.600
Content thyself.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.550
Be Duke of Lancaster.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.550
let him be King.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.550
He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,

17:54.600 --> 17:57.550
And that the Lord of
Westmorland shall maintain.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.550
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget

18:00.600 --> 18:04.550
That we are those which
chased you from the field

18:04.600 --> 18:08.550
And who slew your father,
youthful Clifford.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.550
Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.550
Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,

18:15.600 --> 18:18.550
Thy kinsmen and thy
friends, I'll have more lives

18:18.600 --> 18:21.550
Than drops of blood were
in my father's veins.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.550
Will we show you our title to the crown?

18:24.600 --> 18:28.550
If not, our swords shall
plead it in the field.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.550
What title hast thou,
traitor, to the crown?

18:32.600 --> 18:37.600
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.550
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,

18:42.600 --> 18:45.550
Who made the Dauphin
and the French to stoop

18:45.600 --> 18:47.550
And seized upon their towns and provinces.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.550
Talk not of France, since
thou hast lost it all.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.550
The Lord Protector lost it, and not I.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.550
When I was crowned I
was but nine months old.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.550
You are old enough now
and yet methinks you lose.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.550
Father, tear the crown
from the usurper's head!

19:04.600 --> 19:07.550
Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.550
Sound drums and trumpets,
and the King will fly!

19:09.600 --> 19:11.550
Sons, peace.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.550
Think'st thou that I will
leave my kingly throne,

19:14.600 --> 19:19.550
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?

19:19.600 --> 19:25.550
No, first shall war
unpeople this my realm.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.550
My title's good, and better far than his.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.600
Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.

19:45.600 --> 19:50.600
Henry the Fourth by
conquest got the crown.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.600
'Twas by rebellion against his King.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.550
Richard resigned the crown
to Henry the Fourth,

20:06.600 --> 20:09.550
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.600
He rose against him and made him
to resign the crown perforce.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.550
Suppose he did it unconstrained,

20:16.600 --> 20:19.550
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?

20:19.600 --> 20:24.550
No, for he could not so resign his crown,

20:24.600 --> 20:27.600
But that the next heir
should succeed and reign.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.550
Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?

20:33.600 --> 20:39.600
My conscience tells me he is lawful King.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.600
All will revolt from me and turn to him.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.550
What mutter you, or
what conspire you, Lords?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.550
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,

20:53.600 --> 20:56.550
Or I will fill the house with armed men,

20:56.600 --> 20:59.550
And over the chair of
state, where now he sits,

20:59.600 --> 21:03.550
Write up his title with usurping blood.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.600
My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:

21:11.600 --> 21:18.600
Let me for this my lifetime reign as King.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.550
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,

21:30.600 --> 21:34.600
And thou shalt reign in
quiet while thou liv'st.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.600
I am content.

21:42.600 --> 21:47.600
Richard Plantagenet, Enjoy
the kingdom after my decease.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.550
What wrong is this unto
the Prince, your son!

21:54.600 --> 22:00.550
Base, fearful and despairing Henry!

22:00.600 --> 22:03.550
How hast thou injured both thyself and us?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.550
I cannot stay to hear these articles.

22:05.600 --> 22:09.550
Come, cousin, let us tell
the Queen these news.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.550
Farewell, faint-hearted
and degenerate King,

22:12.600 --> 22:18.600
In whose cold blood no
spark of honour bides.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.550
Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.550
They seek revenge and
therefore will not yield.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.550
Ah, Exeter.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.550
Why should you sigh, my Lord?

22:30.600 --> 22:35.550
Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son

22:35.600 --> 22:42.550
Whom I unnaturally now disinherit.
But be it as it may. I here entail

22:42.600 --> 22:48.550
The crown to thee and
to thine heirs forever,

22:48.600 --> 22:53.550
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath

22:53.600 --> 22:57.550
To cease this civil
war, and, whilst I live,

22:57.600 --> 23:01.600
To honour me as thy King and sovereign.

23:12.600 --> 23:16.550
This oath I willingly
take and will perform.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.550
Long live King Henry!

23:18.600 --> 23:20.550
Long live King Henry.

23:20.600 --> 23:25.550
And long live thou, and
these thy forward sons.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.550
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.500
Accursed be he that
seeks to make them foes.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
Come, boys.

24:20.600 --> 24:24.550
Ah, wretched man! Would I had died a maid

24:24.600 --> 24:28.550
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,

24:28.600 --> 24:31.550
Seeing thou hast proved
so unnatural a father.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.550
Hadst thou but loved
him half so well as I,

24:34.600 --> 24:37.550
Or felt that pain which
I did for him once,

24:37.600 --> 24:40.550
Or nourished him as I did with my blood,

24:40.600 --> 24:43.550
Thou wouldst have left thy
dearest heart-blood there,

24:43.600 --> 24:46.550
Rather than have that
savage Duke thine heir

24:46.600 --> 24:48.550
And disinherited thine only son.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.550
Pardon me, Margaret;

24:50.600 --> 24:53.550
The Earl of Warwick and
the Duke enforced me.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.600
Enforced thee?

24:56.600 --> 24:59.550
Art thou King, and wilt be forced?

24:59.600 --> 25:02.550
I shame to hear thee speak.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.550
Ah, timorous wretch.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.550
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,

25:08.600 --> 25:10.550
The soldiers should have
tossed me on their pikes

25:10.600 --> 25:14.100
Before I would have granted to that act.

25:14.600 --> 25:18.550
But thou prefer'st thy
life to thine honour.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.550
And seeing thou dost,

25:20.600 --> 25:22.550
I here divorce myself,

25:22.600 --> 25:24.550
Both from thy table,
Henry, and thy bed till

25:24.600 --> 25:26.550
That act of Parliament be repealed

25:26.600 --> 25:29.600
Whereby my son is disinherited.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.550
The Lords that have
forsworn thy coward colours

25:35.600 --> 25:40.550
Will follow mine, to thy foul disgrace

25:40.600 --> 25:43.600
And utter ruin of the House of York.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.870
Thus do I leave thee.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.200
Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.600
Thou hast spoke too much already.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.550
Though I be not the eldest, give me leave.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.550
No. I can better play the orator!

26:07.600 --> 26:09.550
But I have reasons strong and forcible!

26:09.600 --> 26:12.550
Why! How now, sons?

26:12.600 --> 26:15.550
At a strife?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.550
What is thy quarrel?

26:16.600 --> 26:18.740
How began it first?

26:22.600 --> 26:25.550
No quarrel,

26:25.600 --> 26:27.550
but a slight contention.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.550
About what?

26:28.600 --> 26:31.550
The crown of England,
Father, which is yours.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.550
Mine, boy?

26:33.600 --> 26:36.550
Not till King Henry be dead.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.550
Your right depends not
on his life or death.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.550
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.550
By giving the House of
Lancaster leave to breathe,

26:46.600 --> 26:49.550
It will outrun you, Father, in the end.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.600
I took an oath...

26:52.600 --> 26:54.550
.. that he should quietly reign.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.550
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.550
I would break a thousand
oaths to reign one year.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.550
No. God forbid your
grace should be forsworn.

27:02.600 --> 27:07.550
So I shall, if I claim by open war.

27:07.600 --> 27:11.550
I will prove the opposite,
if you will hear me speak.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.600
Thou canst not, son. It is impossible.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.550
An oath is of no moment,

27:24.600 --> 27:27.550
Being not took before a
true and lawful magistrate

27:27.600 --> 27:29.550
That hath authority over him that swears.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.550
Henry had none, but did usurp his place.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.550
Then, since 'twas he that
made you to depose, your oath,

27:35.600 --> 27:38.550
My Lord, is vain and frivolous.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.550
Therefore, to arms.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.550
Father, do but think how sweet
a thing it is to wear a crown.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.550
Why do we linger thus?

27:44.600 --> 27:47.550
I will not rest until the
white rose I wear is dyed

27:47.600 --> 27:51.600
- Even in the lukewarm blood
of Henry's heart... - Richard!

27:53.600 --> 27:55.000
Enough!

27:56.600 --> 27:59.550
- My Lord!
- We shall speak more of this.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.550
The Queen with all the
northern earls and lords

28:01.600 --> 28:03.550
Intends here to besiege you in your house.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.070
She is hard by, my Lord.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.550
Edward and George, you
both shall stay with me.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.550
Richard and Edmund, with thy mother fly.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.550
Father, we will win them. Fear it not.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.550
Plantagenet!

28:19.600 --> 28:21.670
Come, son! Edmund!

28:22.600 --> 28:24.550
Go, Richard! Look to thy mother.

28:24.600 --> 28:28.800
Let's issue forth and bid
them battle straight.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.600
Plantagenet!

28:53.600 --> 28:55.550
Go to thy sister's house.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.550
Do not look back. Edmund and
Richard will follow thee.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.550
Come, Richard! Edmond!

29:00.600 --> 29:01.550
Plantagenet!

29:01.600 --> 29:04.550
- Go, Mother!
- Clifford approaches! Go!

29:04.600 --> 29:06.550
Stay here, my Lords.
Conceal thyselves awhile.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.550
- [Plantagenet!]
- Edmond! Richard!

29:09.600 --> 29:12.200
Go, Mother, we will follow!

29:55.600 --> 29:58.600
Plantagenet!

31:06.600 --> 31:09.550
Thou brat of this accursed Duke of York,

31:09.600 --> 31:13.550
Whose father slew my
father, thou shall die.

31:13.600 --> 31:17.550
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath;

31:17.600 --> 31:19.550
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.550
Though speak'st in vain, poor boy;

31:21.600 --> 31:23.550
My father's blood

31:23.600 --> 31:26.550
hath stopp'd the passage
where thy words should enter.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.550
The sight of any of the House of York

31:28.600 --> 31:31.550
Is as a fury to torment my soul.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.550
And till I root out their accursed line

31:33.600 --> 31:37.550
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.550
Therefore...

31:40.600 --> 31:42.550
Let me pray,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.550
let me pray before I take my death.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.550
To thee I pray.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.550
Sweet Clifford, pity me!

31:49.600 --> 31:51.550
Pity?

31:51.600 --> 31:54.550
Thy father slew my father.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.600
Therefore, die.

32:16.600 --> 32:20.550
Plantagenet, I come!

32:20.600 --> 32:22.340
Plantagenet!

33:08.600 --> 33:10.600
Plantagenet!

33:34.600 --> 33:37.550
Come,

33:37.600 --> 33:39.550
rough Westmorland.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.550
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.550
I will not bandy with thee word for word,

33:44.600 --> 33:46.550
But buckle with thee

33:46.600 --> 33:49.600
blows twice two for one.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.600
Hold!

34:33.600 --> 34:35.550
Valiant Clifford!

34:35.600 --> 34:40.600
For a thousand causes I would
prolong awhile the traitor's life.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.550
Come,

34:45.600 --> 34:49.600
make him kneel upon this dung hill here.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.550
What...

35:00.600 --> 35:03.550
what...

35:03.600 --> 35:06.600
was it you that would be England's King?

35:08.600 --> 35:12.400
Where is your mess of
sons to back you now?

35:13.600 --> 35:17.600
Where is your darling Edmund?

35:23.600 --> 35:25.600
A crown for York.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.550
Look, York,

35:31.600 --> 35:35.550
I stain this napkin with the blood

35:35.600 --> 35:37.550
That valiant Clifford,
with his weapon's spike

35:37.600 --> 35:41.600
Made issue from the neck of the young boy.

35:42.600 --> 35:48.550
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.600
Why art thou patient, man?

35:56.600 --> 35:59.550
Thou shouldst be mad.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.600
York cannot speak without a crown.

36:04.600 --> 36:06.550
Hold you his hands,

36:06.600 --> 36:09.600
whilst I do set it on.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.550
Now looks he like a king.

36:29.600 --> 36:34.550
Ay, this is he that
took King Henry's chair,

36:34.600 --> 36:38.550
And this is he was his adopted heir.

36:38.600 --> 36:43.550
But how is it that great Plantagenet

36:43.600 --> 36:48.550
Is crowned so soon and
broke his solemn oath?

36:48.600 --> 36:51.550
As I bethink me,

36:51.600 --> 36:53.550
you should not be King

36:53.600 --> 36:57.550
Till our King Henry had
shook hands with death.

36:57.600 --> 37:05.600
O, 'tis a fault too, too unpardonable.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.550
Off with the crown, and
with the crown, his head!

37:13.600 --> 37:17.600
That is my office, for my father's sake.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.550
Nay, stay,

37:23.600 --> 37:27.600
let's hear the orisons he makes.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.550
She-wolf of France,

37:33.600 --> 37:38.550
O tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.550
There, take thy crown,

37:39.600 --> 37:42.550
and with thy crown my curse

37:42.600 --> 37:46.550
That in thy need such comfort come to thee

37:46.600 --> 37:50.600
As I now reap from thy too cruel hand.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.550
Hard-hearted Clifford,

37:56.600 --> 37:59.550
take me from the world,

37:59.600 --> 38:02.550
My soul to heaven,

38:02.600 --> 38:05.600
my curse upon your heads!

38:08.600 --> 38:11.340
Here's for my father's death!

38:13.600 --> 38:18.550
And here's to right our
gentle-hearted King!

38:25.600 --> 38:29.600
Here's to avenge beloved Somerset.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.550
Off with his head.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.600
Set it atop the city gates.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.550
I wonder how our princely father scaped.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.200
His sword.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.600
See how the morning ope's her golden gates

40:08.600 --> 40:11.600
Bids her farewell to the glorious sun.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.200
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.550
Three glorious suns...

40:21.600 --> 40:24.140
.. each one a perfect sun,

40:25.600 --> 40:28.550
Not separated by the racking clouds

40:28.600 --> 40:33.550
But severed in a pale, clear-shining sky.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.550
See, see, they join,
embrace and seem to kiss,

40:36.600 --> 40:39.550
As if they vowed some league inviolable.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.600
Now are they but one
lamp, one light, one sun:

40:44.600 --> 40:47.600
In this, the heavens figure some event.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.470
I think it cites us, brother...

40:51.600 --> 40:53.550
.. to the field,

40:53.600 --> 40:56.550
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,

40:56.600 --> 40:59.550
Shall join our lights together

40:59.600 --> 41:02.600
And over-shine the earth
as this the world.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.550
But here comes one whose
heavy looks foretell

41:05.600 --> 41:09.200
Some dreadful story hanging on his tongue.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.550
My Lord,

41:16.600 --> 41:18.550
I was a woeful looker-on

41:18.600 --> 41:21.550
When as the noble Duke of York was slain.

41:21.600 --> 41:24.600
By many hands your father was subdued,

41:25.600 --> 41:27.550
But only slaughtered by the ireful arm

41:27.600 --> 41:30.550
Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,

41:30.600 --> 41:33.550
Who crowned the gracious
Duke in high despite,

41:33.600 --> 41:34.550
Laughed in his face,

41:34.600 --> 41:37.270
and when with grief he wept,

41:38.600 --> 41:42.550
The ruthless Queen gave
him to dry his cheeks

41:42.600 --> 41:43.550
A napkin

41:43.600 --> 41:46.550
steeped in the harmless
blood Of sweet young Edmund,

41:46.600 --> 41:49.070
by rough Clifford slain.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.700
After many scorns, many foul taunts,

41:54.600 --> 41:56.870
They took his head...

41:57.600 --> 42:00.600
.. and high on the city
gates they set the same.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.070
And there it doth remain.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.600
The saddest spectacle that e'er I viewed.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.870
Sweet Duke of York...

42:23.600 --> 42:25.550
.. our prop to lean upon,

42:25.600 --> 42:28.550
Now thou art gone, we
have no staff, no stay.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.550
O Clifford, boist'rous Clifford,

42:31.600 --> 42:34.550
thou hast slain the flower
of Europe for his chivalry.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.600
Now my soul's palace is become a prison.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.600
For never henceforth shall I joy again.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.070
Never...

42:45.600 --> 42:48.550
.. O never shall I see more joy!

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
I cannot weep.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.000
Weeping is for babes...

42:57.600 --> 43:00.550
.. blows and revenge for me.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.550
Richard, I bear thy name;

43:02.600 --> 43:06.550
and I will venge thy death
or die by attempting it.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.550
His name that valiant
duke hath left with thee;

43:08.600 --> 43:12.200
His dukedom and his chair with ME is left.

43:12.600 --> 43:15.270
For the chair and dukedom...

43:15.600 --> 43:17.550
.. throne and kingdom say;

43:17.600 --> 43:19.550
Either they are thine,

43:19.600 --> 43:21.550
or else thou wert not his.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.600
How now, fair Lords?

43:25.600 --> 43:27.550
Thou shalt know

43:27.600 --> 43:30.550
this strong right hand of mine

43:30.600 --> 43:33.550
Can pluck the diadem
from faint Henry's head

43:33.600 --> 43:37.550
Were he as famous and as bold in war

43:37.600 --> 43:42.600
As he is famed for
mildness, peace and prayer.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.550
But in this troublous
time, what's to be done?

43:46.600 --> 43:50.550
Shall we go throw our coats of steel away?

43:50.600 --> 43:51.550
Or shall we

43:51.600 --> 43:54.550
on the helmets of our foes

43:54.600 --> 43:57.550
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.550
If for the last,

43:59.600 --> 44:01.550
say, "Ay", and to it, Lords.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.600
Why, therefore Warwick
came to seek you out,

44:07.600 --> 44:10.550
Now, friends, to London will we march,

44:10.600 --> 44:13.550
And once again cry,
"Charge!" upon our foes.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.550
Lord Warwick,

44:14.600 --> 44:17.550
on thy shoulder will I lean;

44:17.600 --> 44:18.550
And when thou fail'st,

44:18.600 --> 44:20.800
God forbid the hour,

44:21.600 --> 44:24.550
Must Edward fall, which
peril heaven forfend!

44:24.600 --> 44:27.550
No longer Earl of March,

44:27.600 --> 44:28.550
but Duke of York;

44:28.600 --> 44:32.550
The next degree is England's royal throne.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.550
For King of England
shalt thou be proclaimed

44:36.600 --> 44:39.550
In every borough as we pass along.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.340
King Edward!

44:56.600 --> 44:58.670
Welcome, my Lords.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.550
Yonder's the head of that arch enemy

45:02.600 --> 45:05.600
That sought to be
encompassed with your crown.

45:07.600 --> 45:11.600
Doth not the object cheer
your heart, my Lord?

45:12.600 --> 45:14.550
To see this sight

45:14.600 --> 45:18.550
it irks my very soul.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.600
Withhold revenge, dear God.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.550
My gracious liege,

45:26.600 --> 45:30.550
this too much lenity And
harmful pity must be laid aside.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.550
Ambitious York did level at thy crown,

45:33.600 --> 45:36.550
He, but a duke, would have his son a king.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.550
Thou, being a king,

45:38.600 --> 45:40.550
blest with a goodly son,

45:40.600 --> 45:43.550
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,

45:43.600 --> 45:47.200
Which argued thee a most unloving father.

45:48.600 --> 45:50.550
Were it not pity

45:50.600 --> 45:52.550
that this godly boy

45:52.600 --> 45:55.600
Should lose his birthright
by his father's fault?

45:56.600 --> 45:58.600
Look on the boy

45:59.600 --> 46:02.270
and steel thy melting heart.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.550
Clifford,

46:05.600 --> 46:07.550
didst thou never hear

46:07.600 --> 46:12.550
That things ill-got had ever bad success?

46:12.600 --> 46:14.550
And happy

46:14.600 --> 46:17.550
always was it for that son

46:17.600 --> 46:20.600
Whose father for his
hoarding went to hell?

46:23.600 --> 46:27.550
I'll leave my son my
virtuous deeds behind,

46:27.600 --> 46:31.600
And would my father had left ME no more.

46:33.600 --> 46:36.550
Ah,

46:36.600 --> 46:38.550
cousin York,

46:38.600 --> 46:41.550
would thy best friends did know

46:41.600 --> 46:45.550
How it doth grieve me
that thou art thus slain.

46:45.600 --> 46:48.550
My Lord, cheer up your spirits:

46:48.600 --> 46:51.550
our foes are nigh,

46:51.600 --> 46:56.600
And this soft courage
makes your followers faint.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.550
You promised knighthood
to our forward son.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.550
Unsheathe your sword

47:00.600 --> 47:02.550
and dub him presently.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.740
Edward, kneel down.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.140
Edward...

47:11.600 --> 47:13.550
.. Ned...

47:13.600 --> 47:15.670
Prince of Wales...

47:17.600 --> 47:19.670
.. arise a knight,

47:20.600 --> 47:22.940
And learn this lesson:

47:23.600 --> 47:26.600
draw thy sword in right.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.550
My gracious father,

47:35.600 --> 47:37.550
by your kingly leave

47:37.600 --> 47:40.550
I will defend our crown unto the death.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.270
My liege...

47:43.600 --> 47:46.550
Royal commanders, be in readiness,

47:46.600 --> 47:49.550
For with a band of strongly armed men

47:49.600 --> 47:51.550
Comes Warwick, backing
of the Duke of York,

47:51.600 --> 47:54.550
Now Edward, made so by his father's death.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.550
They all proclaim him King.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.200
Prepare your battle, for they are at hand.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.550
I would Your Highness
would keep from the field.

48:03.600 --> 48:07.600
The Queen hath best success
when you are absent.

48:08.600 --> 48:10.550
Ay, good, my Lord, and
leave us to our fortune.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.600
Why, that's my fortune too...

48:16.600 --> 48:19.070
.. therefore, I'll come.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.900
Be it with resolution, then, to fight.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.550
'Was ever King that
joyed an earthly throne

49:44.600 --> 49:47.600
'And could command no more content than I?

49:49.600 --> 49:51.550
'No sooner was I crept out of my cradle

49:51.600 --> 49:54.550
'But I was made a king,

49:54.600 --> 49:56.800
'at nine months old.

49:57.600 --> 50:01.550
'Was never subject longed to be a king

50:01.600 --> 50:05.600
'As I do long and wish to be a subject.'

50:12.600 --> 50:15.600
Are you there, butcher?

50:17.600 --> 50:19.550
Ay, crookback,

50:19.600 --> 50:22.270
here I stand to answer thee.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.550
'Twas you that killed my brother,

50:25.600 --> 50:26.550
was it not? Ay,

50:26.600 --> 50:31.550
This is the hand that
stabbed thy father York,

50:31.600 --> 50:33.550
And here

50:33.600 --> 50:36.550
is the hand that slew thy brother Edmund,

50:36.600 --> 50:37.550
And this is the heart

50:37.600 --> 50:40.550
that triumphs in their death.

50:40.600 --> 50:42.550
Speak not spite,

50:42.600 --> 50:45.550
For you shall sup with
Jesu Christ tonight.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.550
Foul stigmatic,

50:47.600 --> 50:49.550
that's more than thou canst tell.

50:49.600 --> 50:54.550
If not in heaven, you'll
surely sup in hell.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.400
Have at thee!

51:27.600 --> 51:29.600
O, I fall.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.600
Come, Richard...

51:36.600 --> 51:39.550
.. I stabbed your father's bosom,

51:39.600 --> 51:41.800
Now split my breast.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.870
Dispatch me, Richard,

51:45.600 --> 51:47.400
Have mercy...

51:50.600 --> 51:52.600
.. and dispatch.

51:59.600 --> 52:02.600
Disperse me, Richard -- have mercy!

52:04.600 --> 52:06.600
Richard!

52:13.600 --> 52:14.870
O...

52:18.600 --> 52:20.400
.. O Henry...

52:25.600 --> 52:28.600
.. hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,

52:29.600 --> 52:32.550
Or as thy father and his father did,

52:32.600 --> 52:35.600
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm

52:36.600 --> 52:40.200
Had left no mourning widows for our death.

52:43.600 --> 52:45.550
The foe is merciless

52:45.600 --> 52:47.670
and will not pity.

52:53.600 --> 52:57.100
Much effuse of blood doth make me faint.

52:58.600 --> 53:00.600
Dispatch, Henry.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.600
Dispatch...

53:51.600 --> 53:54.550
This man, like me, a humble foot soldier

53:54.600 --> 53:58.550
Now killed by me, will
have no use for coins.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.550
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.550
Where are your crowns, old man?

54:03.600 --> 54:06.550
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold,

54:06.600 --> 54:10.400
For I have bought it
with an hundred blows.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.600
Who's this?

54:19.600 --> 54:20.940
O God!

54:21.600 --> 54:24.000
It is my father's face.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.600
Heavy times, begetting such events!

54:36.600 --> 54:38.140
That I...

54:38.600 --> 54:41.600
.. who at his hands received my life,

54:42.600 --> 54:46.600
Have by MY hands of life bereaved him.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.550
Oh, no.

54:49.600 --> 54:51.600
No, no...

54:53.600 --> 54:55.800
It is my eldest son.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.600
Pardon me, God...

55:01.600 --> 55:04.070
.. I knew not what I did;

55:06.600 --> 55:08.870
And pardon, father...

55:10.600 --> 55:13.000
.. for I knew not thee.

55:16.600 --> 55:19.600
O, pity, God, this miserable age!

55:21.600 --> 55:23.600
O pity...

55:24.600 --> 55:26.600
.. pity...

55:27.600 --> 55:30.600
.. gentle heaven, pity!

55:34.600 --> 55:37.000
I'll bear thee hence...

55:37.600 --> 55:40.270
.. where I may weep my fill.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.000
I'll bear thee hence...

55:43.600 --> 55:46.540
.. and let them fight that will.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.070
Would that I were dead...

55:58.600 --> 56:01.400
.. if God's good will were so.

56:02.600 --> 56:06.550
For what is in this world

56:06.600 --> 56:10.600
but grief and woe?

56:30.600 --> 56:32.550
Away, madam, away,

56:32.600 --> 56:33.550
the King is missing.

56:33.600 --> 56:38.600
York triumphs and wallows
in our spilt blood. Away!

56:55.600 --> 56:58.600
All hail King Edward.

57:01.600 --> 57:04.600
Now breathe we, Lords...

57:05.600 --> 57:07.550
.. good fortune bids us pause

57:07.600 --> 57:12.100
And smoothes the frowns of
war with peaceful looks.

57:12.600 --> 57:15.550
Whose soul is that who
takes her heavy leave?

57:15.600 --> 57:19.550
And now the battle's
ended, If friend or foe,

57:19.600 --> 57:21.550
let him be gently used.

57:21.600 --> 57:24.270
Revoke that doom of mercy...

57:24.600 --> 57:26.870
.. for 'tis Clifford.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.550
From off the city gates
fetch down the head,

57:31.600 --> 57:35.550
Your father's head, which
Clifford placed there;

57:35.600 --> 57:39.550
Instead whereof let HIS supply the room:

57:39.600 --> 57:42.550
Measure for measure

57:42.600 --> 57:43.550
must be answered.

57:43.600 --> 57:46.550
Lift up that fatal
screech-owl to our house

57:46.600 --> 57:50.400
That nothing sung but
death to us and ours.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.550
I think his understanding is bereft.

57:53.600 --> 57:56.600
Speak, Clifford...

57:57.600 --> 58:00.800
.. dost thou know who speaks to thee?

58:02.600 --> 58:07.550
Dark, cloudy death
o'ershades his beams of life,

58:07.600 --> 58:11.550
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

58:11.600 --> 58:12.550
Clifford,

58:12.600 --> 58:15.600
ask mercy and obtain no grace.

58:17.600 --> 58:21.550
What, not an oath?

58:21.600 --> 58:24.550
Nay, then the world goes hard
when Clifford cannot spare

58:24.600 --> 58:26.550
an oath for his friends,

58:26.600 --> 58:29.070
I know by that he's dead.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.550
Off with the traitor's head,

58:31.600 --> 58:32.550
Then to the palace

58:32.600 --> 58:34.550
with triumphant march,

58:34.600 --> 58:39.600
There to be crowned England's royal King.

58:43.600 --> 58:45.550
Even as thou wilt, sweet
Warwick, let it be;

58:45.600 --> 58:49.600
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat.

58:51.550 --> 58:52.550
Richard,

58:52.600 --> 58:55.550
I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,

58:55.600 --> 58:57.550
George, of Clarence.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.550
Warwick, as ourself,

58:58.600 --> 59:01.600
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

59:02.550 --> 59:03.550
Now to London,

59:03.600 --> 59:06.600
To see these honours in possession.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.600
Now...

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.550
.. even of pure love,

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.550
I greet mine own land
with my wishful sight.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.600
No, Harry...

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.550
.. Harry, 'tis no land of thine;

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.550
Thy place is filled,

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.550
thy sceptre wrung from thee,

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.550
Thy balm washed off
wherewith thou wast anointed.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.550
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.600
No, not a man comes for redress of thee.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.140
For how can I help them...

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.670
.. and not myself?

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.550
Let me embrace thee, sour adversaries

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.600
For wise men say it is the wisest course!

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.550
This is the former King;
let's seize upon him.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600
Forbear awhile.

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:31.550
O God!

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.600
Methinks it were a happy life, to
be no better than a homely swain,

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.550
Thereby

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.600
to see the minutes how they run,

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.600
How many make the hour full complete,

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.600
How many hours bring about the day,

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.600
How many days will finish up the year.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:02.600
How many years a mortal man may live.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.600
When this is known,
then to divide the times:

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.550
So many hours must I tend my flock,

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.550
So many days my ewes have been with young,

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.600
So many years ere I
shall shear the fleece.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.550
So, minutes,

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.550
hours,

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.550
days, months and years,

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.550
Passed over to the end they were created,

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.550
Would bring white hairs

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.600
unto a quiet grave.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.600
Ah...

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.200
.. what a life were this...

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.600
.. how sweet, how lovely!

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.550
Gives not the hawthorn
bush a sweeter shade

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.550
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.550
Than doth a rich embroidered canopy

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.550
To kings that...

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.600
that fear their subjects' treachery?

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.670
O, yes, it doth...

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.550
.. a thousandfold it doth.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.600
Say...

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.550
.. what art thou that
talk'st of kings and queens?

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.550
More than I seem,

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.550
and less than I was born to:

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.550
For men may talk of kings, and why not I?

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600
Ay...

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.550
.. but thou talk'st as
if thou WERT a king.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.550
Why, so I am,

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.600
in mind, and that's enough.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.550
If thou be a king,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.550
where is thy crown?

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.140
My crown is in my heart...

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.600
.. not on my head: Nor to be seen.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.600
My crown is called content,

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.550
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:06.550
Well, if thou be a king
crowned with content

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.550
You must be contented

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.800
To go along with us.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.550
God save King Edward, fourth of that name!

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.600
God save the King!

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.550
What is Your Lordship's
business in France?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.550
To make the French King's
sister Edward's queen.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.550
So shalt he sinew both
these lands together

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.550
And, having France our
friend, we shall not dread

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.400
The scattered foe that
hopes to rise again.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.550
Thus Margaret used her state and birth

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.550
To gain sanctuary for her and her son

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.550
At the very heart of Louis' court.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.550
King Louis cannot greatly sting to hurt,

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.550
Yet look to have him buzz
to offend thine ears.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.600
He is a prince soon won with moving words.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.550
King Louis hath been tainted with remorse

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.550
To hear and see her
plaints, her brinish tears,

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.550
Queen Margaret is a subtle orator.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.600
The tiger will be mild
whiles she doth mourn.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.550
Thou speaks't truth.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.550
Farewell, my Lord.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.550
Lord Hastings... farewell.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.550
Good King of England, at Edgecote field

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.550
This lady's husband, Sir
Richard Grey, was slain,

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.550
His lands then seized on by Lancastrians,

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.550
Her suit is now to repossess those lands.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.550
Your Highness shall do
well to grant her suit,

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.550
It were dishonour to deny it her.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.550
Ugh! Well, widow, we will
consider of your suit

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.550
And come some other time to know our mind.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.550
Right gracious Lord, I cannot brook delay.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.550
May it please Your
Highness to resolve me now

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.600
And what your pleasure
is shall satisfy me.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.550
I see the lady hath a thing to grant

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.600
Before the King will
grant her humble suit.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.550
How many children hast
thou, widow, tell me?

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.140
One son, my gracious Lord.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.550
'Twere pity he should
lose his father's lands.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.550
Be pitiful, dread Lord, and grant it then.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.870
Lords, give us leave.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.939
Now, tell me, madam...

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.550
.. do you love your son?

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.550
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.550
And would you not do much to do him good?

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.550
To do him good, I would sustain some harm.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.550
Then get your husband's
lands to do him good.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.600
Therefore I came unto Your Majesty.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.550
What service wilt thou
do me, if I give them?

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.550
What you command that rests in me to do.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.550
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.550
No, gracious Lord, except I cannot do it.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.550
Ay, but thou canst do
what I do mean to ask.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.600
Well, then, I will do
what Your Grace commands.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.550
What stops my Lord,
shall I not hear my task?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.550
An easy task -- 'tis but to love a king.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.550
That's soon performed,
because I am a subject.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.550
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.550
Well, then, you mean not
as I thought you did.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.550
To tell thee plain, I
aim to lie with thee.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:56.700
To tell YOU plain, I had
rather lie in prison.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.550
Why then, thou shalt not
have thy husband's lands.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.550
Well, then, mine honesty
shall be my dower,

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.550
For by that loss I will not purchase them.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.550
Therein thou wrong'st thy child mightily.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:10.550
Herein Your Highness
wrongs both him and me

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:13.800
In thy suggestion I become thy whore.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.540
You do mistake my meaning, lady.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.600
Say that King Edward
take thee for his queen?

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.550
His queen, my Lord?

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.470
Sweet widow...

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.550
.. by my state, I swear to thee,

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.600
I mean no more than
what my soul intends...

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.550
And that is to enjoy thee for my love.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.550
And that is more than I will yield unto.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.800
List to me, widow...

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.800
I did mean my queen.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.550
Welcome, brave Warwick!

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.550
What brings thee to France?

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.550
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.550
I come in kindness and unfeigned love,

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.550
First, to crave a league of amity

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.550
And then to confirm that
friendship with a nuptial knot,

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:54.550
if thou vouchsafe to grant that
virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.550
To England's King in lawful marriage.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.550
King Louis and Lady Bona, hear me speak

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.550
Before you answer Warwick. His demand

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.550
Springs not from Edward's
well-meant, honest love,

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.550
But from... deceit...

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.550
.. bred by necessity,

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.550
For how can tyrants safely govern home,

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:22.550
Unless abroad they
purchase great alliance?

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.550
- Injurious, Margaret...
- And why not "queen"?

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.550
Because thy father Henry did usurp

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.550
And she is no more queen
than thou art a prince.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.550
Why, Warwick, canst thou
speak 'gainst thy true King

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.550
And not betray thy treason with a blush?

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.550
For shame, Oxford, Leave
Henry and call Edward King.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.550
No, Warwick, no,

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.550
While life upholds this arm,

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.550
This arm upholds the House of Lancaster.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.550
And I the House of York!

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.550
Now, Warwick,

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.550
Tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Is Edward your true King?

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.550
For I were loath

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.550
To link with him that
were not lawful chosen.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.600
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.550
Our sister shall be Edward's.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.600
Ah!

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:28.550
Until today, Louis WAS Henry's friend.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.550
And still is friend to him and Margaret.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.550
And shall you have all kindness at my hand

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.600
That your estate requires
and mine can yield.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.550
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:47.600
My Lord of Warwick, this letter is
for you, sent from your brother.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.600
This, from our King unto Your Highness.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.550
And Margaret

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.600
This for you, from whom I know not.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.700
Has your King married the Lady Grey?

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.550
Is this the alliance that
he seeks with France?

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.550
Dare he presume to scorn
us in this manner?

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.550
King Louis, I here
protest, in sight of heaven

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.550
That I am clear from
this misdeed of Edward's.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.550
No more my King, for he dishonours me

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.600
But most himself if he
could see his shame.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.550
Did I impale him with the regal crown?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.550
Did I put Henry from his native right?

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.550
And am rewarded at the last with shame?

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.600
Shame on himself, for my desert is honour!

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.550
I here renounce him...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:04.000
.. and return to Henry.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.550
My noble Queen, let former grudges pass,

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.550
And henceforth I am thy true servitor.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.550
I will revenge this wrong to Lady Bona

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.600
And replant Henry in his former state.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.200
Warwick...

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:35.550
These words have turned my hate to love...

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.550
.. and I forgive and
quite forget old faults,

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.550
And joy that thou becom'st
King Henry's friend.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.550
So much his friend, ay,
his unfeigned friend,

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.550
That if King Louis will
vouchsafe to furnish us

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.550
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.550
I'll undertake to land them on our coast

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.550
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.550
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.600
But by thy help to this distressed Queen?

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.550
You shall have aid.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.550
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.550
Then, England's messenger, return in post,

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.870
And tell false Edward

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:22.550
Thy supposed King,

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.550
That Louis of France
is sending over masquers

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.550
To revel it with him and his new bride.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.550
Tell him

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.550
I am ready to put armour on.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.550
Tell him from me that
he hath done me wrong,

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.550
Therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.550
Warwick, answer me one doubt.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.600
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.550
This assures my constant loyalty.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.550
That, if our Queen and
this young Prince agree...

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.550
I'll join mine youngest
daughter, Lady Anne

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.600
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.550
Yes...

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.550
I agree.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.550
And thank you for your motion.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.600
Son Edward...

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.550
Yes. I accept.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.600
Now here, to pledge my
vow, I give my hand.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.550
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.400
For mocking marriage
with a dame of France!

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.600
Good shot, sire! Well played.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.550
- Aah!
- Ooh!

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.940
Again.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.550
Oh!

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.550
Well done.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.550
Now, brother of Clarence,

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.540
how like you our choice of wife?

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.550
I am your King and I must have my will.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.550
And shall have your
will, because our King.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.550
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.550
Yea, brother Richard,
are you offended too?

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:39.550
Not I, no.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.550
God forbid that I should
wish them severed,

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.550
Whom God hath joined together!

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.550
Setting your scorns and
your mislike aside,

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.550
Give me some reason why thou disapproves

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.550
Of Elizabeth as my wife
and England's Queen.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.270
Speak freely what you think.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.550
Then, to have joined with
France in sound alliance

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.550
By marrying the proud King Louis' sister

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.550
Would more have strengthened
this, our commonwealth,

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.550
Than any home-bred marriage.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.550
Ay, what of that?

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.550
It was my will and grant,

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:14.550
And for this once, my
will shall stand for law.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.550
And yet methinks Your
Grace hath not done well

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.550
To give the heir and
daughter of Lord Scales

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.550
Unto the brother of your loving bride.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.550
She better would have
suited me than Rivers.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.550
Alas poor Clarence

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:29.550
Is it for a wife that thou art malcontent?

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.550
Well, I will provide thee.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.550
And in choosing for yourself
you've shown your judgment,

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.550
Which being shallow,
you shall give me leave

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.550
To play the broker in mine own behalf.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.550
And to that end I shortly
mind to leave you.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.550
Leave me, or tarry,

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.600
Edward will be King and not be
tied unto his brother's will.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.550
My Lord, their dislike, to
whom I would be pleasing,

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.550
Doth cloud my joys with
danger and with sorrow.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.550
My love, forbear to
fawn upon their frowns.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.550
What danger or what sorrow can befall you

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.550
So long as Edward is thy constant friend

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.600
And their true sovereign,
whom they must obey?

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.600
And they shall obey, and love thee too

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.600
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands.

01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:30.550
My liege!

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.550
What letters or what news
from France Good Hastings?

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.550
And what answer makes King
Louis unto our letters?

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.550
"Go tell false Edward, thy supposed King,

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.550
"That Louis of France
is sending over masquers

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.550
"To revel it with him and his new bride."

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.550
Is Louis so brave?

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.550
But what said Henry's Queen?

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.550
For I am sure that she was there in place.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.550
"Tell him," quoth she, "I
am ready to put armour on."

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.550
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.600
But what said Warwick to these injuries?

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.550
He, more incensed against
Your Majesty than all the rest,

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.550
Sent to my liege these words,

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.550
"Tell him from me that
he hath done me wrong,

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.550
"And therefore I'll uncrown
him ere't be long."

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.550
Ha!

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.550
Durst the traitor breathe
out so proud words?

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.550
Well, I will arm me,
being thus forewarned.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.600
They shall have wars and
pay for their presumption.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.550
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:26.800
Ay.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.550
Gracious sovereign, they
are so linked in friendship

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.550
That the young prince will
marry Warwick's daughter, Anne.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.550
Now, brother King,
farewell, and sit you fast,

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.550
For I will hence to
Warwick's other daughter,

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.550
That, though I want a
kingdom, yet in marriage

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.600
May I not prove inferior to yourself.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.550
My brother flies to Warwick?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.550
Yet, am I arm'd against
the worst can happen,

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.550
And haste is needful
in this desp'rate case.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.550
They are already, or
quickly will be, landed.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.550
I need to levy men and make for war.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.540
But ere I go, brother Richard...

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.550
Tell me if YOU love Warwick more than me.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.550
If it be so, then go, depart to him.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.600
I rather wish for foes
than hollow friends.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.870
Will you stand by us?

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.600
Yay.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.600
And in despite of those
that shall withstand you.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:51.550
Trust me, my Lord, all hitherto goes well.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.550
Ah...

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.600
The common people, by
numbers, swarm to us.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.340
And see where Clarence waits.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.600
Speak suddenly, my Lord,
are we all friends?

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.550
Fear not that, my Lord.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.550
Then, gentle Clarence,
welcome unto Warwick.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.550
I hold it cowardice

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.550
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.550
Hath pawned an open hand in sign of love,

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.550
Else might I think that
Clarence, Edward's brother,

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.600
Were but a feigned
friend to our proceedings.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:26.600
But welcome, George.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.600
My younger daughter shall be thine.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.600
My Lord!

01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:00.550
Open the gate!

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.600
Open the gate for Lord Warwick!

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.000
Father.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.400
Good Warwick.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:32.550
After God, thou set'st me free.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.600
He was the author, thou the instrument.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:46.600
Therefore, that I may
conquer fortune's spite

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:55.550
And that the people of this blessed land

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:01.550
May not be punished by my thwarting stars,

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.600
Warwick...

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:10.550
.. although my head still wear the crown,

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:16.550
I here resign my government to thee,

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.550
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.600
And I choose only Clarence for Protector.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.600
Warwick and Clarence
give me both your hands.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:41.600
Now join your hands, and
with your hands your hearts,

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.550
That no dissension hinder government.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.600
I make you both protectors of this land,

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.550
While I myself will
lead a private life here

01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.550
And spend my latter days in devotion,

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:06.600
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.550
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.550
To Henry's body, and supply his place.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.550
Then for the first of
all your chief affairs

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:22.550
Let me entreat, for I command no more,

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:23.550
That Margaret, your Queen

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:26.600
Be sent for, to return
from France with speed.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.600
It shall be done, my
sovereign, with all speed.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.550
And Exeter, what youth is that,

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.100
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.600
My liege, it is young
Henry, Earl of Richmond.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.600
After yourself and your
young son the Prince,

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.550
He is the last descendent
of old John of Gaunt.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:58.340
He is the House of Lancaster.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.600
Come hither, England's hope.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.550
If secret powers

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.600
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:26.600
This pretty lad will prove
our country's bliss.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.070
Make much of him, Lords.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.550
Come, sit by me.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.800
What counsel, Lords?

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.550
Let's levy men, meet Edward in the field.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:45.600
Farewell, sweet Lords,
let's meet at Tewkesbury.

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.550
Of this young Richmond,

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.550
Forthwith I'll take him hence to Brittany,

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.600
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.600
It shall be so.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.870
Halt!

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.600
We have come to parley with Warwick.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:57.550
See where the surly Warwick sits.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.550
O, unbid spite, is sportful Edward come?

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.550
Now, Warwick, wilt thou, as is thy duty,

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.550
Speak gentle words and
humbly bend thy knee

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.550
Call me thy King and
at my hands beg mercy?

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.550
Nay, rather, wilt thou
draw thy forces hence,

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.550
Confess who set thee up
and pluck'd thee down?

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.550
Call Warwick patron and be penitent

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.550
And thou shalt still
remain the Duke of York.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.550
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.200
I will do thee service for so good a gift.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.550
'Twas I that gave the
kingdom to thy brother.

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:39.550
Why then 'tis mine, if
but by Warwick's gift.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.550
Come, Warwick, take the time, kneel down.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.270
Kneel down!

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:50.550
Nay, when? Strike now,
or else the iron cools.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.550
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.550
And with the other fling it at thy face,

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.070
Than bear so low a sail.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.600
And lo, where George of
Clarence sweeps along,

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.550
With whom an upright
zeal to right prevails

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.600
More than the nature of a brother's love!

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.550
Come, Clarence, come.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.600
Thou wilt, if Warwick call.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.070
Brother?

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.600
Father of Warwick, know
you what this means?

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:58.600
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.550
I will not ruinate my father's house,

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.550
Who gave his blood to
lime the stones together,

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.600
And set up Lancaster.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.550
I am so sorry for my trespass made

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.600
That, to deserve well
at my brother's hands,

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.550
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.550
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.600
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:36.550
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.600
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.600
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.550
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:05.550
For I will henceforth
be no more unconstant.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.550
Now welcome more, and
ten times more beloved,

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.550
Than if thou never hadst
deserved our hate.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.550
Welcome, good Clarence,

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.600
this is brother-like.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:33.550
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.550
What, Warwick, wilt thou
leave thy tent and fight?

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.550
Or shall we beat the
stones about thine ears?

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.600
Alas, I am not cooped here for defence.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.550
I will unto the field presently,

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:53.550
And bid thee battle,
Edward, if thou darest.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.550
Yes, Warwick, Edward
dares, and leads the way.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.550
Come, Lords, to the field,

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.600
Saint George, and victory!

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:52.550
Forward!

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.550
Charge!

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.870
Argh!

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.550
Charge!

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:10.600
Charge!

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:01.600
It grieves me to see thee
once more a traitor, Clarence.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.600
Come!

01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:14.550
Why dost thou pause?

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.550
With thy brave bearing
should I be in love, Exeter

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.550
But that thou art so fast mine enemy.

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.550
Nor should thy prowess
want praise and esteem,

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.200
But that its shows ignobly and in treason.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.550
Ugh!

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.600
War hath given thee
peace, now thou art still.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.600
Peace to his soul,
heaven, if it be thy will!

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.550
'Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.550
'Lo, now my glory smeared
in dust and blood.

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:36.550
'Why, what is pomp, rule,
reign, but earth and dust?

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:44.550
'And, live we how we
can, yet die we must.'

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.200
Warwick...

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:48.600
Ah, Warwick...

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.550
Warwick, wert thou as we are

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:56.550
We might recover all our loss again.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:43:03.550
Look to my daughter, Oxford, look to Anne

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.670
And keep her safe.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.550
I bid you farewell

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.550
to meet in heaven...

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.550
Ha! Victory for York!

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.600
Take her!

01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:08.550
Hang the traitor.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.550
Go, send him hence, I
will not hear him speak.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.600
Come on.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:19.600
God save King Henry!
God save Queen Margaret!

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.550
So part we sadly in this troublous world

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.600
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem!

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.600
Lo where youthful Prince Ned comes.

01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:37.550
Ned!

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.550
Bring forth the gallant,

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.940
Let us hear him speak.

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.200
What? Can so young a thorn begin to prick?

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.550
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:54.550
For all the trouble
thou hast turned me to?

01:45:54.600 --> 01:46:01.550
Speak like a subject,
proud ambitious York.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.550
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:10.600
Resign thy chair, and where
I stand kneel thou, traitor.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.550
By heaven, wretch, we'll
plague thee for that word!

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.550
Peace, wilful boy, or I
will charm your tongue.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.550
Untutored lad, thou art impudent.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:27.550
I know my duty, you are all undutiful.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:32.550
Lascivious Edward, and
thou perjured George.

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.550
And thou, misshapen Dick.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.550
Ned!

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:42.550
I tell ye all I am your
better, traitors as ye are,

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:48.550
And thou usurp'st my
father's right and mine.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.550
Take that!

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.600
Sprawl'st thou?

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:09.600
Take this, to end thy agony.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.550
Kill me too!

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.550
Marry, and shall.

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:21.600
Hold, Richard, hold, for
we have done too much.

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:30.600
Why should she live, to
fill the world with words?

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.550
Excuse me to the King my brother,

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.550
I'll hence to London on a serious matter.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.550
Ere ye come there, be
sure to hear some news.

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.550
What?

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.870
The Tower. The Tower.

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.550
Away with her. I charge
ye, bear her hence.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.550
Nay, never bear me
hence, dispatch me here.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.600
Here!

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.400
Away with her and waft
her hence to France.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.870
Where's Richard gone?

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:44.550
To London all in haste and as I guess

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:48.600
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.200
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:25.550
Victory for York and victory for Edward

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.600
Now Duke of York, soon to be a king.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:44.550
Would he were wasted,
marrow, bones and all,

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.550
That from his loins no
hopeful branch may spring

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.600
To cross me from the
golden time I look for.

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:01.540
I do but dream on sovereignty...

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.550
Like one that stands upon a promontory

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.550
And spies a far-off shore

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.550
So do I wish for the crown,

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.600
being so far off.

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:30.550
My eye's too quick, my
heart o'erweens too much,

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.600
Unless my hand and
strength could equal them.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:38.550
Well, say there is no
kingdom then for Richard,

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.600
What other pleasure can the world afford?

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.550
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.600
And witch sweet ladies
with my words and looks.

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.740
O!

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.550
O miserable thought,

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:01.550
and more unlikely

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.600
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.550
Why, Love forswore me in my mother's womb,

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.550
And did corrupt frail
nature with some bribe,

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:23.550
To shrink mine arm up
like a withered shrub,

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:26.550
To place an envious mountain on my back,

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:31.550
Where sits deformity to mock my body,

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.550
To shape my legs of an unequal size,

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.550
To disproportion me in every part,

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.600
Like to a CHAOS!

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:46.600
And am I then a man to be beloved?

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.600
O monstrous fault, to
harbour such a thought!

01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:02.600
Then, since the earth
affords no joy to me,

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.500
I'll make my heaven to
dream upon the crown,

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:13.600
And, whiles I live, account
this world but hell.

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:28.550
And yet I know not how to get the crown,

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.600
For many lives stand between me and home,

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.550
And I, like one lost in a thorny wood,

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.550
Seeking a way and straying from the way,

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.600
Torment myself to catch the English crown.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.550
And from that torment I will free myself,

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.600
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:06.550
Why, I can smile,

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:10.550
and murder whiles I smile,

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:15.600
And cry "content!" to that
which grieves my heart,

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:22.550
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:26.600
And frame my face to all occasions.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.550
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:37.600
Tut, were it farther
off, I'll pluck it down.

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.670
Good day, my Lord.

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:24.600
What, at your book so hard?

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.550
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:36.600
We must confer.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:50.600
So flies the reckless
shepherd from the wolf.

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.550
What scene of death
hath we two now to act?

01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.550
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind,

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.550
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:08.550
Ah, kill me with thy
weapons, not with words!

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.550
My breast can better
brook thy dagger's point

01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:14.550
Than can my ears that tragic history.

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.550
But wherefore dids't thou come?

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.550
Is't for my life?

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.550
Think'st thou I am an executioner?

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.550
A persecutor I am sure, thou art,

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.550
If murdering innocents be executing,

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.550
Why then, thou art an executioner.

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.600
Thy son I killed for his presumption.

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:47.550
Hadst thou been killed when
first thou didst presume

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:51.550
Thou hadst not lived
to kill a son of mine.

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:57.550
And thus I prophesy --
that many a thousand,

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:03.550
Men for their sons,
wives for their husbands,

01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.550
Orphans for their
parents' timeless deaths,

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:12.550
Shall rue the hour that
ever thou wast born.

01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:17.550
The owl shriek'd at thy
birth, an evil sign,

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:24.550
Dogs howled, and hideous
tempest shook down trees.

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.550
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:32.550
And, yet brought forth
less than a mother's hope,

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.600
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump.

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:42.550
Teeth hadst thou in thy
head when thou wast born,

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:46.550
To signify thou camest to bite the world.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.550
And, if the rest be true which I have...

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.700
I'll hear no more! Die,
prophet in thy speech!

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:57.200
For this amongst the rest, was I ordained.

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.600
Ay, and for much more
slaughter after this.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:09.600
O God, forgive my sins,

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:13.600
And pardon thee.

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:30.600
See how my sword weeps
for the poor King's death!

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.550
O may such purple tears be always shed

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:39.550
From them that wish the
downfall of our house.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:42.550
If any spark of life be yet remaining,

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:46.550
Down, down to hell, and
say I sent thee thither,

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:51.550
I that have neither pity, love, nor fear.

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.550
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of,

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:19.550
For often have I heard my mother say

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:22.550
I came into this world
with my legs forward.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.550
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.600
And seek their ruin
that usurp'd our right?

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:35.600
Then, since the heavens
have shaped my body so...

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.600
Let hell make crook'd
my mind to answer it.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:48.550
I have no brother,

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:52.550
I am like no brother.

01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:56.550
And this word "love",

01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.550
which gray-beards call divine,

01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.550
Be resident in men like one another

01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.600
And not in me.

01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:09.600
I am myself alone.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:33.550
'Once more we sit in
England's royal throne,

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.550
'Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.550
'Thus have we swept
suspicion from our seat

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:43.550
'And made our footstool of security.'

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:45.550
Listen to me!

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:47.600
I am the Queen!

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.550
I am the QUEEN!

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:56.550
'Prince Edward, for thee,
thine uncles and myself

01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.550
'Have in our armours
watch'd the winter's night,

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:03.550
'That thou might'st
repossess the crown in peace,

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:07.700
'And of our labours thou
shalt reap the gain.'

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.550
Clarence and Gloucester,

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:14.600
Kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:23.550
Thanks, noble Clarence.

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:26.600
Worthy brother, thanks.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:35.550
And, that I love the tree
from whence thou sprang'st,

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:39.600
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:12.550
To say the truth, Judas kissed his master

02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:19.550
And cried "All hail!"
when as he meant all harm.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.550
Now am I seated as my soul delights,

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.550
Having my country's peace
and brothers' loves.

02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:28.550
Sound drums and trumpets!
Hail the House of York!

02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:33.550
For here I hope begins our lasting joy.

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.550
Long live Prince Edward!

02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:39.600
Long live Prince Edward!

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:43.800
Long live Prince Edward!
