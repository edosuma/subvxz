Previously onSWAT...

00:02.611 --> 00:05.222
Who are you? Help! Help!

00:05.266 --> 00:07.442
What do you want?

00:07.485 --> 00:10.401
Tell me your lawyers
didn't just wire $50 million

00:10.445 --> 00:13.317
to the Committee for the Poor.People demanded $50 million

00:13.361 --> 00:14.753
for charity.
Does that sound

00:14.797 --> 00:16.625
like this is a group
that wants to harm my daughter?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.496
They're gonna
kill me, Daddy.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.063
CINQUE:
This is a holdup!

00:20.107 --> 00:22.283
LAUREN: First person picks
his head up-- I'll blow it off.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.067
This is the SLA playbook.
They didn't just evade us,

00:24.111 --> 00:26.243
they targeted us, too.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.290
Two of our men found explosives under their squad cars today.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.118
HONDO:
They tried to get us
to return fire into the house.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.120
JESSICA:
They want us to kill her.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.252
I know it feels like
the bad guys got away,

00:35.296 --> 00:38.038
but you should be proud,
all of you. We got her home.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.344
CINQUE :
Be good to each other
or we'll be back.

00:40.388 --> 00:43.086
With an all-new,
much bigger show.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.914
I got this new house in
East Hollywood, right?

00:44.957 --> 00:46.263
I'm still fixing it up.
It's a two-bedroom.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.396
I'm only using one.

00:48.439 --> 00:51.355
So we gonna bunk together
again or what, man? Yeah?Yeah.

00:51.399 --> 00:54.184
So you want to tell me
what's going on at work?

00:54.228 --> 00:55.968
You always start these little
projects when you're spinning

00:56.012 --> 00:58.101
and need to feel like
you can fix something.

00:58.145 --> 01:01.017
I just feel like...
like nothing ever changes.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.541
I just want to know that
I'm making a real difference.

01:44.582 --> 01:47.150
ALAN:
Where are the kids, Becca?

01:47.194 --> 01:49.631
Were they-- Were they out
with their new dad again?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.154
Tell me where they are!

01:51.198 --> 01:53.417
ALAN:
Don't lie to me again.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.203
Don't make me do what I did to
your parents. Where are they?!

01:56.246 --> 01:58.292
BECCA: Please don't hurt me.
I'm not hiding anything.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.163
ALAN: Say you're sorry.BECCA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.773
ALAN: Say you're sorry
for everything.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.775
BECCA: I am.ALAN: I don't believe you.

02:04.994 --> 02:07.170
CHRIS: Get down, now!

02:07.214 --> 02:08.215
Alan, drop it! Drop it!STREET: On your stomach!

02:08.258 --> 02:10.434
On your stomach!
Give me your hand!

02:10.478 --> 02:12.741
HONDO:
This is 20-David to Command.
Code 4.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.612
Suspect in custody.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.787
Hostage is safe.
CHRIS:
You're okay now.

02:15.831 --> 02:20.052
Come on. You're okay now.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.184
I thought
you shot him.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.317
It's bean bag rounds.
He'll live.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.883
You should've used
real bullets.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.015
Hey, it's okay.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.497
It's okay. Come on.
Let's go.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.022
Sarzo says he'll be done
laying the floors by noon,

02:33.065 --> 02:35.242
and renovations will
officially be done.

02:35.285 --> 02:37.200
I'm thinking about getting
some pies from Desano's,

02:37.244 --> 02:39.333
break open the home brew.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.204
What do you say we all
christen the new pad tonight?

02:41.248 --> 02:43.163
Uh, wish I could,
but I got CrossFit.

02:43.206 --> 02:46.035
Oh, we still working off the
extra holiday pounds, fat boy?

02:46.078 --> 02:47.210
Please.
Chris?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.169
Date night with Ty and Kira.
Sorry.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.475
Hey, how's it going
with them?Good, so far.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.216
That's all you're gonna
give us? "Good so far"?

02:53.260 --> 02:54.609
I don't want to jinx anything.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.088
Hey, Deac? You in?

02:56.132 --> 02:57.438
You kidding me?
Between work and moonlighting,

02:57.481 --> 02:59.135
I haven't seen Annie
and the kids in two days,

02:59.179 --> 03:00.441
and I got another
security gig tonight.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.138
So nobody's in?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.184
Listen up.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.229
Team debrief,
you know the drill.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.492
Any problems we got
with each other or the mission,

03:08.536 --> 03:09.972
or any mistakes we want to
own up to, we hash it out

03:10.015 --> 03:11.800
right here, right now,
and then we move on.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.803
Anyone?

03:17.327 --> 03:19.286
How about you, Chris?

03:20.765 --> 03:23.072
The mirror?I know.

03:23.115 --> 03:24.291
He almost got the jump on us.
You should have

03:24.334 --> 03:25.509
spotted that mirror coming in

03:25.553 --> 03:26.945
and adjusted your
movements accordingly.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.252
This guy had already killed
his ex-wife's parents.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.254
We are lucky we didn't have
another victim on our hands.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.213
Sorry, I-I should have clocked
that earlier.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.433
It's about getting the details
right, being perfect.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.044
I expect better.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.873
From all of us.

03:43.527 --> 03:46.313
'Cause this don't cut it.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.535
Hey, Chris, tell you what.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.145
I'll put some movement exercises
on the training schedule.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.625
All right? For all of us.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.061
We could all use the practice.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.802
All right?

04:08.552 --> 04:11.033
What the-- What are you doing?

04:11.076 --> 04:12.252
Hey! Let me go!

04:25.656 --> 04:27.832
Help! Please, help!

04:27.876 --> 04:29.138
MAN:
Security! Hey!

04:29.181 --> 04:31.532
Hey! Let her go! Now!

04:33.708 --> 04:36.667
Shots outside the Caldow.
I've engaged suspects.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.409
Call 911! We have
a shooter heading inside.

04:39.453 --> 04:40.497
Lock down the building.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.674
BAYO:
Get down! Get down now!

04:45.459 --> 04:46.808
Move! Get down!

04:52.901 --> 04:53.945
Move! Move!

05:05.130 --> 05:06.436
HONDO:
Still waiting for confirmation,
but initial reports

05:06.480 --> 05:07.872
sound like it was
a workplace shooting.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.439
Security managed
to put the building

05:09.483 --> 05:11.789
on lockdown, evacuate most
of its employees.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.400
But not before the suspect
holed up in reception

05:13.443 --> 05:14.836
with six hostages.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.359
Just got a report
from the officer on scene.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.230
It wasn't a workplace shooting,
it was an abduction.

05:18.274 --> 05:21.233
Two masked suspects,
one got away with a woman.A kidnapping?

05:21.277 --> 05:22.539
TAN:
Hey, at least
three other abductions

05:22.583 --> 05:24.889
in the last half hour
by masked assailants.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.065
North Hollywood, Pico-Robertson
and Inglewood.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.371
CHRIS:
Four simultaneous
kidnappings

05:28.415 --> 05:30.025
in completely different parts
of town?

05:30.068 --> 05:31.113
No way that's a coincidence.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.077
LUCA: Excuse me,
out of the way.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.688
Out of the way.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.129
Hello.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.609
HONDO:
My name is Sergeant Harrelson
with LAPD SWAT.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.654
I just want to talk to you.
Is that all right?

05:50.698 --> 05:52.613
Okay.Let's start with your name.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.484
It's Bayo.All right, Bayo.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.834
You have full control
over how this ends.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.488
If you let those people go
and surrender,

05:58.532 --> 06:00.925
no one gets hurt,
including you.

06:00.969 --> 06:03.319
I can't-- I can't do that.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.321
I can't let him down.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.757
Let who down, Bayo?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.542
Is there someone I can call?
Let me help you, man.

06:08.585 --> 06:11.545
It's not what he would want.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.721
Who wouldn't want that, Bayo?

06:13.764 --> 06:16.332
HONDO: Bayo?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.377
Bayo, are you still with me?

06:24.296 --> 06:26.777
Gunfire, emergency entrance.
Chris, cover us.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.388
Luca, you're with me.

06:30.302 --> 06:33.480
It's 20-David to Command.
Suspect down.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.441
Kidnappings and ski masks.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.790
That remind you
of anything?

06:39.834 --> 06:41.618
That group that got away
from us three months ago.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.360
DEACON :
Hondo. Better come see this.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.231
Got this from the captain.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.798
It was just released online.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.452
CINQUE :
We warned you to be good,

06:49.496 --> 06:51.454
or we'd be back.

06:51.498 --> 06:55.023
Well, this morning,
we took five employees

06:55.066 --> 06:57.939
from five of the largest
corporations in Los Angeles:

06:57.982 --> 07:00.811
DeWitt Investments,
McCahey Construction,

07:00.855 --> 07:03.597
Kinari Imports,
Caldow Pharmaceutical,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.337
Wayland Financial.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.949
For too long, these companies

07:07.992 --> 07:10.081
have avoided paying
their fair share,

07:10.125 --> 07:12.823
hiding billions overseas
and evading taxes,

07:12.867 --> 07:14.956
while ordinary citizens struggle
to make ends meet

07:14.999 --> 07:17.393
and our communities starve.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.135
Well, no longer.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.485
To these five companies,

07:22.529 --> 07:24.356
we've calculated
your fair tax burden

07:24.400 --> 07:27.751
to be $523 million.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.841
You'll each receive
an individual bill.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.887
Your options are as follows.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.845
Send us the money.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.891
Your employees will be set free,

07:36.934 --> 07:38.109
and the funds
will be distributed

07:38.153 --> 07:40.155
to charities around the country.

07:40.198 --> 07:43.114
Or don't, and your employees

07:43.158 --> 07:46.074
will pay for your sins
with their lives.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.512
Your tax bill is due... today,

07:49.556 --> 07:51.993
courtesy of the Emancipators.

07:52.036 --> 07:54.691
You each have 12 hours
to show the world

07:54.735 --> 07:58.390
how you actually care
about your workers.

07:58.434 --> 08:02.482
Starting... now.

08:45.699 --> 08:46.917
HONDO:
Any update?

08:46.961 --> 08:48.353
The companies have confirmed
the employees

08:48.397 --> 08:49.877
that were taken hostage.JESSICA: All hourly workers.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.531
Janitor, IT, retail.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.533
So, what, they kidnap Jane
Lunch Lady and force companies

08:53.576 --> 08:55.578
to choose between profits
and blue-collar victims?

08:55.622 --> 08:56.623
Yeah, it looks like it.DEACON:
What better way

08:56.666 --> 08:58.799
to highlight
class inequality?

08:58.842 --> 09:00.365
In their written instructions,
the Emancipators want

09:00.409 --> 09:02.150
$540 million wired

09:02.193 --> 09:04.239
to an anonymous
Bitcoin account

09:04.282 --> 09:05.632
to be distributed
to various charities.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.938
They're keeping $17 million
as a service fee.

09:07.982 --> 09:09.810
Oh, how charitable.JESSICA: Three months ago,
they were modeling themselves

09:09.853 --> 09:12.726
after the SLA,
but this is something different.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.031
So the intel
my grandfather gathered

09:14.075 --> 09:15.946
fighting the SLA 45 years ago...

09:15.990 --> 09:17.339
Yeah, I'm afraid that's not
gonna help us this round, Luca.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.601
RHD is spread thin;

09:18.645 --> 09:20.603
other departments
are stepping in.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.344
Patrol is rounding up
hostages' families,

09:22.387 --> 09:23.998
bringing some to SWAT
for protection.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.390
Ask them if they've
seen anything

09:25.434 --> 09:27.044
or anyone suspicious
in the past few weeks.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.264
Meanwhile, Digital Forensics
is studying the video

09:29.307 --> 09:32.267
for any clues to their hideout.No, it didn't work last time.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.486
What about the companies?
Have you heard from them?HICKS: Mayor Barrett's meeting

09:34.530 --> 09:36.793
with the five CEOs
at Caldow Pharmaceutical

09:36.837 --> 09:38.752
corporate headquarters.
I'm heading over now to advise.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.363
Cortez has command.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.626
TAN: RHD got a hit on
our dead guy, Bayo.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.236
Our prints show his real name
is Ronald Campbell.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.238
Dr. Ronald Campbell. 29.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.066
Postdoc out of UC Santa Cruz.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.982
Wrote a thesis titled "Efficacy
of Radical Protest Groups."

09:52.026 --> 09:53.680
Quit his teaching gig
at Northridge a year back.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.420
RHD's searching for
a last known address.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.987
Be ready to roll
as soon as we get it.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.077
These guys got away
from us last time.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.514
Not this time.

10:02.558 --> 10:06.083
This is the same group on the
news from a few months ago?

10:06.127 --> 10:08.085
The one that bombed
the cop car in Hollywood?

10:08.129 --> 10:10.000
That's who kidnapped my mom?

10:10.044 --> 10:11.872
Bridget, did your mom mention
anything odd happening

10:11.915 --> 10:13.221
in the last week or two?

10:13.264 --> 10:14.657
Anyone following her?

10:14.701 --> 10:16.920
Or a strange encounter?No.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.009
Nothing. She's just
a receptionist.

10:19.053 --> 10:22.404
She makes... little charms
in her spare time.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.188
She barely makes any money.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.016
What do they want with her?

10:26.060 --> 10:29.367
We're trying
to figure that out.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.896
Is that one
of your mother's charms?

10:37.941 --> 10:41.118
Last week, I blew her off to
hang out with a girlfriend.

10:41.162 --> 10:45.557
Now, I'd give anything
just to see her again,

10:45.601 --> 10:47.037
just to tell her I love her.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.039
Hey, I'm sure
she knows that.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.650
I know you're worried
about her,

10:50.693 --> 10:52.913
but we have cops all over
the city looking for her.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.567
So, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.789
Hey, RHD found an address
on our suspect.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.009
We got a search warrant.
We're rolling.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.664
See? That's good news.
That's one of the people

11:04.707 --> 11:07.144
involved in taking your mom,
so you hang tight.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.016
Promise me that
you'll bring her back, please.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.671
We'll do everything we can.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.940
Give me two!

11:19.983 --> 11:21.202
Give me two!Two!

11:21.245 --> 11:23.334
Right side clear!Left side clear!

11:23.378 --> 11:25.597
Left side clear!Clear!

11:25.641 --> 11:27.643
Code 4 all the way around.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.951
Really leaning into that whole
radical minimalism aesthetic.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.736
No dishes, no pots, not even
a cup. He wasn't living here.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.998
Then what the hell
was he doing?

11:35.042 --> 11:37.653
Hondo? Hondo? C4.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.133
A lotof C4.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.135
Looks like the good doctor
was their bomb maker.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.832
Yeah, looks like he was getting
savvier. Cell phone triggers.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.442
All right,
Tan, you're with Chris.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.793
Call bomb squad, stay here
and coordinate with them.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.795
Meanwhile, let's clear
the rest of the block. Go.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.840
Move.

11:52.015 --> 11:55.366
Robert, why is it
every time I see you,

11:55.410 --> 11:57.064
it's the worst day
of my career?

11:57.107 --> 11:59.544
Well, correlation,
not causation,

11:59.588 --> 12:01.503
I can assure you
that, Mayor Barrett.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.027
What's the
temperature in there?Sucks.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.116
My kind of party.WOMAN:
Maybe we should pay.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.771
You have any idea
the PR nightmare we'll face

12:08.815 --> 12:10.904
if we refuse,
and the worst happens?

12:10.947 --> 12:12.340
Our brand is
all about community.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.342
MAN:
Look what they did
to Tucker's daughter

12:14.385 --> 12:16.474
after he paid the ransom.
They kept her!

12:16.518 --> 12:18.781
You're gonna to drop
$100 million with no guarantee

12:18.825 --> 12:20.348
they'll actually
return your guy alive?

12:20.391 --> 12:22.350
We care about our
employees, okay?

12:22.393 --> 12:25.092
Our guy has a family.
You tell his kids

12:25.135 --> 12:26.310
it doesn't make
financial sense.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.182
You pay out now,
they're gonna grab

12:28.225 --> 12:29.487
another one
of your workers tomorrow.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.141
You put
the entire workforce at risk.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.230
Then give me a
better idea, Jeremy.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.797
BARRETT:
Excuse me.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.582
This is Commander Hicks
from LAPD Metro SWAT.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.976
Now, if we could just move
into the boardroom...

12:40.020 --> 12:41.978
Jeremy DeWitt. You find
these Emancipators yet?

12:42.022 --> 12:44.633
We're currently following
up on a number of leads.Great.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.243
That's a no.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.202
Look, I-I can appreciate
that this is a tough time

12:48.245 --> 12:50.378
for you and your companies,
but right now,

12:50.421 --> 12:52.597
the best course of action is
to hold off,

12:52.641 --> 12:55.035
let the elite officers of SWAT
do their jobs.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.254
You want us to bend over
for these terrorists?

12:57.298 --> 12:59.604
Well, just lay low.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.259
You know, no statements,
no tweets, nothing.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.218
If we find your employees
before the deadline, then...

13:04.261 --> 13:06.916
you won't have to make a
decision on the ransoms at all.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.830
MAN: And if you
don't find them

13:07.874 --> 13:09.179
before the deadline?

13:09.223 --> 13:10.833
HICKS: Well, I have faith
in my officers.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.269
Let's see what they
can do before you panic.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.271
Well, with all due
respect, Commander,

13:14.315 --> 13:16.839
my very well-paid
kidnap-and-ransom specialist

13:16.883 --> 13:20.277
is telling me that I need
to issue a statement ASAP.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.149
Well, with all due respect,
Mr. DeWitt,

13:22.192 --> 13:24.238
neither you nor your specialist
have ever dealt

13:24.281 --> 13:25.935
with this group before.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.632
We have.And they got away
the first time.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.809
Well, with no loss
of innocent lives.

13:32.289 --> 13:35.510
No. I never trusted
the public sector.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.294
I'm not about to start now.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.862
Well, what do you think
you're gonna do?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.864
Well, I'm gonna make
some hard calls,

13:41.908 --> 13:44.084
because that's what
my shareholders pay me to do.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.260
Oh.

13:46.303 --> 13:49.306
Excuse me?

13:57.271 --> 13:59.229
LUCA:
Captain says

13:59.273 --> 14:01.014
you needed some help.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.972
Yeah, Ronald Campbell had
an active Twitter feed.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.670
RHD asked us to see
who follows this crazy,

14:05.714 --> 14:07.194
flag anyone who sticks out.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.848
Just heard from Sarzo.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.676
House is good to go for tonight,
assuming we wrap this up.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.070
Although, looks like it's
just gonna be you and me

14:14.114 --> 14:15.855
christening the party pad.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.161
Yeah. Uh, actually, uh...

14:18.205 --> 14:20.163
What? You, too?

14:20.207 --> 14:22.209
Where are you gonna be,
man? You live there.I got this buddy

14:22.252 --> 14:23.471
in Long Beach,
and he promised me

14:23.514 --> 14:24.951
this sick new exhaust
for my bike.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.430
He's only holding it
for tonight.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.432
I mean, chances are
we're still gonna be stuck here

14:28.476 --> 14:30.478
anyway working on the case.
What's the big deal?

14:30.521 --> 14:32.262
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.873
Man, I haven't seen you
this bummed out

14:33.916 --> 14:36.266
since the El Tauro taco truck
stopped coming by our house.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.964
What's going on?

14:38.007 --> 14:41.141
Luca, talk to me.

14:41.184 --> 14:45.623
It's just, when I was, like, 12,

14:45.667 --> 14:48.931
my dad used to take me to this
run-down cop bar-- Charlie's.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.846
Your dad took you drinking
as a kid?
No.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.022
No, smart-ass.
He'd sit me down

14:53.066 --> 14:55.503
at this Police Action
pinball machine,

14:55.546 --> 14:58.898
and I'd play for hours while
he'd down a few cold ones

14:58.941 --> 15:02.205
with his squad after a shift.

15:02.249 --> 15:05.687
Look, the-the point
is, is-is, like,

15:05.730 --> 15:08.211
it's the only place

15:08.255 --> 15:11.258
that I ever saw
my dad really let go

15:11.301 --> 15:13.782
and relax, you know,
after a long day at SWAT.

15:13.825 --> 15:17.960
I was hoping my new place
would be our Charlie's.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.614
You know, somewhere
that we could go

15:19.657 --> 15:22.182
and just forget about
all this once in a while.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.835
That's all.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.360
JESSICA:
We may have a problem.

15:28.362 --> 15:31.539
Yonas is a valued member
of our community.

15:31.582 --> 15:35.021
His wife wants her husband back.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.588
His children want
their father back.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.417
And to these Emancipators,
these cowards

15:40.461 --> 15:42.985
going after people
who can't defend themselves,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.334
well, you listen to me.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.249
You harm this man,

15:46.293 --> 15:49.644
and I will use all the resources
at my disposal to hunt you down.

15:49.687 --> 15:52.386
And if you've got an issue with
that, you can come to my office

15:52.429 --> 15:54.954
and take it up with me
face-to-face.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.999
Thank you. Thank you.

15:57.043 --> 16:01.438
Can't imagine that going over
well with our radical friends.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.397
Looks like
we might be going all night.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.834
ANNIE:
Yeah, I've been watching
the news nonstop. It's crazy.

16:05.877 --> 16:06.922
How is it on your end?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.010
Yeah, it's pretty hectic.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.316
Might have to call Dee

16:09.359 --> 16:10.882
and back out
of that security gig tonight.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.275
City comes first.

16:12.319 --> 16:15.931
Hey, um, I've been thinking.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.761
After the baby's born, maybe
I should look for some work.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.415
You know, two incomes

16:21.458 --> 16:23.373
is better than one.DEACON:
Annie, no.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.942
We'll have a newborn, and-and
what about the other kids?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.249
Half of what you'd earn would
end up going to child care.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.033
Even so, I...

16:31.077 --> 16:34.123
Annie... trust me.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.343
I can provide for this family.

16:38.519 --> 16:40.521
I know.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.916
All right, I got to go.
I love you.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.701
I love you, too. Hey,

16:46.744 --> 16:48.355
be safe.

16:56.189 --> 16:57.973
I'm sending out for tacos.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.627
Here. Put your order in.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.504
Hey, isn't that the DeWitt
employee who got kidnapped?

17:23.433 --> 17:26.088
Hold up.
Where's the badge?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.785
I need to speak to Mr. DeWitt.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.265
He's not taking meetings today.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.571
What's under your jacket?

17:30.614 --> 17:32.834
Please, I need to speak
with him!

17:32.877 --> 17:35.228
You know what's been
going on here today?

17:36.925 --> 17:39.058
Wait.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.234
You're the guy.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.195
They said if I don't deliver

17:46.239 --> 17:47.849
a message to Mr. DeWitt,

17:47.892 --> 17:50.547
they're gonna blow me up, and
anyone within 100 feet of me.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.559
No, no, no.
Where-Where's DeWitt?

18:02.603 --> 18:03.604
He can't come down.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.475
He said to give me the message.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.737
That's not gonna work!

18:06.781 --> 18:08.783
They said
I had to speak to him directly.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.915
Hey, man, he's not coming.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.571
I'm sorry.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.399
What am I supposed to do?!I'm sorry.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.227
Just get him on the line.
Let me talk to him!

18:18.271 --> 18:19.663
Help me!

18:22.231 --> 18:23.798
HONDO:
All right, Luca, Street,

18:23.841 --> 18:25.191
help Patrol form
a perimeter.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.757
Deacon, with me.I need everyone back!

18:26.801 --> 18:28.890
Hondo, security took DeWitt
out a back entrance.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.805
We know they're using a cell
phone trigger. Did we shut down

18:30.848 --> 18:32.633
those cell towers yet?Just got confirmation.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.809
Every tower
in a half-mile radius is down.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.289
ETA on the bomb squad?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.594
It's gonna be
at least 15 minutes.

18:37.638 --> 18:38.813
Captain,
that's cutting it too close.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.120
We're going in. Deacon.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.993
Yonas, Yonas, stay still.
Stay still.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.473
We're LAPD SWAT.
We're here to help.

18:46.516 --> 18:47.909
Just get away from me
and save yourselves.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.389
We're gonna get
this thing off of you,

18:49.432 --> 18:50.738
but we're gonna do everything
nice and easy.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.392
Do you understand?

18:52.435 --> 18:53.784
Move it back!
Come on, let's go.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.699
Come on!Move, move, move!

18:55.743 --> 18:56.918
Keep going.
Move out.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.615
Hey, is it me,
or does that dude seem

18:58.659 --> 19:00.095
way too interested
in making a phone call?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.792
STREET: You're thinking
cell phone trigger?

19:01.836 --> 19:04.752
Hey!Let's go, let's go.
Move, move, move!

19:04.795 --> 19:06.841
Out of the way!

19:06.884 --> 19:09.583
Watch out!Move, move, move!

19:18.157 --> 19:20.202
Take the stairs.
I'll get the other end.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.600
HONDO: All right, I'm
cutting left side.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.691
What was that?Trip wire must've been
hidden in the strap.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.172
Wait, wait, wait,
d-did you hear that?

19:33.215 --> 19:34.347
Yeah. We triggered
a fail-safe.

19:34.390 --> 19:35.913
We gotta get this off him now.

19:35.957 --> 19:36.958
Come on, please!Yonas, Yonas,
look at me, look at me.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.046
look at me.
You're gonna be fine.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.135
I got nothing.Me neither.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.658
Deac, you ready?
Yeah.

19:41.702 --> 19:46.228
Okay. One...
two... three.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.666
Yonas, move, move,
move, move, move!

19:53.844 --> 19:56.195
Go!

20:02.288 --> 20:03.985
LUCA: Hondo!CHRIS: Deac!

20:04.028 --> 20:06.422
Over here.LUCA:
Geez, am I glad to see you guys.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.163
Where's the suspect?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.817
He got away.
Got away?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.384
Yeah, we lost him
in the crowd,

20:11.427 --> 20:12.863
then we heard the explosion,
so we rushed back.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.865
Your job isn't to worry
about me, Luca,

20:14.909 --> 20:16.780
it's to get the suspect.Yeah, we lost sight of him.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.521
I didn't know if there
were civilian casualties,

20:18.565 --> 20:20.828
so I made the call to come...Well, you made
the wrong call, man.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.396
And what about you two?
Where were you
during all of this?

20:23.439 --> 20:25.267
We were heading back to HQ
from the apartment

20:25.311 --> 20:26.616
when the captain told us
to get over here.Came as fast as we could.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.009
Letting these guys
get away again

20:28.052 --> 20:29.619
is inexcusable.

Hondo, come on.

20:29.663 --> 20:30.838
The situation was
out of control.

20:30.881 --> 20:31.969
We just rescued a hostage.
That's a win.

20:32.013 --> 20:33.797
We have four hostages
still missing,

20:33.841 --> 20:35.408
and we are nowhere closer
to finding out who took 'em.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.888
That is not a win!
Stop kidding yourselves.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.803
You've gotta do
better than this.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.849
We all do.

20:41.892 --> 20:45.505
Otherwise we are just
wasting our damn time

20:45.548 --> 20:47.071
and putting lives at risk.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.777
I hope you appreciated
the first act.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.214
But don't worry, though.
The show's not over.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.999
To those of you,
like Mr. DeWitt,

21:02.043 --> 21:03.871
who think this is a game,

21:03.914 --> 21:08.528
I assure you
the stakes are very, very real.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.573
Your time just got cut in half.

21:10.617 --> 21:14.838
You all now have four hours
to pay your debt to society,

21:14.882 --> 21:17.972
or your employees die.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.931
Well, after they saw what
happened to DeWitt's building,

21:20.975 --> 21:24.413
the other CEOs agreed to hold
off on issuing any statements.

21:24.457 --> 21:26.937
Meanwhile, the hospital cleared
Yonas Mekonnen for an interview.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.636
You two see if he can tell us
anything that will help.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.507
On it.

21:31.551 --> 21:34.031
Deacon, hold up a sec.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.556
Pull the car around?I'll meet you
in the motor pool.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.823
Everything all right?What, you mean other than

21:42.866 --> 21:44.346
barely surviving an explosion?

21:44.390 --> 21:46.174
I mean at home.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.742
I saw another approval form for
a moonlighting gig on my desk.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.396
Oh, yeah, that was before
all this had happened.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.702
I doubt I'll make it tonight,
so you can...

21:52.746 --> 21:55.749
you can ignore it.Oh. That would've been the
fourth one this week, right?

21:55.792 --> 21:58.839
Yeah. I'm just trying
to bank some extra cash

21:58.882 --> 22:00.754
before the baby comes.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.886
Deac, come on.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.975
There's "I'm about to
have a kid" moonlighting,

22:05.019 --> 22:08.283
and then there's "I'm about to
lose the house" moonlighting.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.329
Which is it?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.595
Somewhere in the middle.

22:17.118 --> 22:20.513
It started with the baby.
Then some pipes burst.

22:20.556 --> 22:23.472
Then a couple investments
came up short,

22:23.516 --> 22:26.040
and, uh, one just happened
after the other.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.650
Been there.Usually I make it up

22:27.694 --> 22:30.479
with overtime,
but these budget cuts...Damn.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.916
I didn't realize
it was that bad.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.311
Look, um, if you and Annie need

22:36.355 --> 22:38.095
some help...I appreciate it.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.706
I'm handling it.All right.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.969
But the offer still stands.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.058
Some advice?

22:44.101 --> 22:45.886
Sure.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.410
I know you're spread thin,

22:48.454 --> 22:51.108
but the one thing you
won't regret later

22:51.152 --> 22:53.197
is spending time with
your wife and kids.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.029
Do it while you still can.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.254
You wanted to see me?Close the door.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.826
I was on the radio when
you laid into your team.

23:12.869 --> 23:15.394
A little rough, don't you think?

23:15.437 --> 23:18.135
I don't want to see these
guys get away a second time,

23:18.179 --> 23:20.181
someone lose their life.No one does.

23:20.224 --> 23:22.879
But Luca and Street
were in an impossible situation.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.229
They couldn't chase
a guy they couldn't see.

23:25.273 --> 23:28.102
There were teammates
and civilians in danger.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.191
What would you have done?

23:30.234 --> 23:32.454
Look,

23:32.498 --> 23:35.283
if this were a onetime thing,
I wouldn't have brought it up.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.850
It's your team.
You've earned the right

23:36.893 --> 23:38.852
to run it the way you see fit.

23:38.895 --> 23:42.116
But there's something going on
with you recently.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.031
Even I can see it,

23:44.074 --> 23:46.207
and I'm not as close to you
as I used to be.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.430
I just want to make sure
you're okay.

23:55.521 --> 23:58.524
I don't know what's
been up with me lately.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.482
But...

24:00.526 --> 24:03.833
as soon as this case is over,

24:03.877 --> 24:06.009
I'll try to figure it out.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.715
Mr. Mekonnen, is there
anything that you can tell us

24:15.758 --> 24:16.977
about the people that
were holding you?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.979
Uh, I don't know.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.155
I was blindfolded, and...

24:21.198 --> 24:23.244
when I did see them,
they wore masks.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.637
CHRIS: You were in
the van with them

24:24.680 --> 24:26.552
after they fitted you
with the bomb.

24:26.595 --> 24:27.814
How long was the drive
to the office building?

24:27.857 --> 24:29.250
15, 20 minutes.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.382
But I never saw them.DEACON:
What about the place

24:31.426 --> 24:33.036
where you were being held? I
mean, it could be anything.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.560
Something you smelled,
maybe heard?

24:34.603 --> 24:36.649
There was something.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.739
This nonstop pounding
from outside.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.175
Steady, like a...

24:41.218 --> 24:43.177
a hammer
hitting a nail, but...

24:43.220 --> 24:44.439
much, much louder.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.094
I could feel it
in my whole body.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.922
Like a construction site, maybe?

24:48.965 --> 24:51.141
I don't know.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.142
Something like this?

24:57.147 --> 24:59.759
Exactly like that.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.500
It's a hydraulic pile driver.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.110
You can thank my Uncle Sarzo
for that.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.894
You'd need a permit for
something like that.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.157
Luca, we may have something.Thanks.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.463
LUCA:
Deacon and Chris might have

25:08.507 --> 25:10.378
found a way to nail down
the hostages' location.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.945
Yeah, the red dots
are construction sites

25:11.988 --> 25:13.686
that pulled permits for
a hydraulic pile driver today.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.514
Yonas Mekonnen
could hear one operating

25:15.557 --> 25:17.080
from where he was being held.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.560
Hostages must be near
one of these sites.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.562
So let's narrow it down.Yonas said the drive

25:20.606 --> 25:23.565
to the DeWitt Headquarters
building was about 20 minutes.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.089
Only two of the construction
sites are close enough
to fit the timeline.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.917
We're searching property records
for anything that stands out.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.223
I think I found something.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.441
There's an old factory

25:30.485 --> 25:32.095
500 feet from one
of the construction sites.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.314
Place was purchased recently
for $800 grand.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.576
All cash.

25:34.620 --> 25:35.708
Well, considering they
cleared $5 million

25:35.751 --> 25:37.187
a few months back,

25:37.231 --> 25:38.493
that'd be cheap.That's got to be
where they are.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.103
I'll have Cortez
pull whatever intel

25:40.147 --> 25:41.322
she can find and
start a warrant.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.019
Just get there.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.465
Go, now.

26:07.783 --> 26:09.045
Ready.Do it.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.917
Three, two, one.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.543
This is the room from the video.
They were here.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.110
Sweep the rest of the place.
Move, move!

26:38.597 --> 26:40.947
Right side clear.Left side clear.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.879
TAN:
Ten o'clock!

27:02.142 --> 27:04.013
She dropped the gun!

27:16.809 --> 27:18.680
LUCA:
We found a few trip wires.

27:18.724 --> 27:21.030
She must've been rigging
the place to blow.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.118
Where are the hostages?

27:24.120 --> 27:27.036
You should get that.
It's for you.

27:36.263 --> 27:39.179
CINQUE :
Sergeant Daniel Harrelson?

27:39.222 --> 27:40.702
The sergeant from South L.A.?

27:40.746 --> 27:44.010
I wanted to talk
to the officer

27:44.053 --> 27:46.665
who's been obstructing me.Oh, I'm sorry about that.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.101
CINQUE:
No, I admire your dedication.All right, you know my name.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.146
How about you tell me yours?

27:50.190 --> 27:52.192
You can call me Cinque.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.194
Cinque? Like the leader
of the SLA in the '70s?

27:54.237 --> 27:55.935
That's real cute, man.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.110
CINQUE: You know where
you are, Sergeant?

27:57.153 --> 27:58.285
Factories like this

27:58.328 --> 28:01.114
used to employ thousands
of people.

28:01.157 --> 28:05.074
The area was flourishing.
So much potential... wasted.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.989
Then the unions got busted.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.297
Workers replaced by cheap labor
or robots.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.125
They locked us in ghettos
and called them "projects".

28:12.168 --> 28:14.214
The police stopped policing,
and let the gangs

28:14.257 --> 28:16.042
pump our veins with poison.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.087
And only then
did the police return,

28:18.131 --> 28:20.089
in full militarized force,

28:20.133 --> 28:22.135
to imprison the very addicts
and dealers

28:22.178 --> 28:23.571
they created in the first place.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.008
You making a point,
or are you just wasting spit?

28:26.052 --> 28:28.750
CINQUE: They tell us to put
our faith in institutions.

28:28.794 --> 28:31.535
This is what institutions
give you.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.538
Neglect. Abandonment.
Destitution.

28:34.582 --> 28:36.932
You want that to change?
Why don't you run for office?

28:36.976 --> 28:38.542
CINQUE: You're an optimist.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.501
Well, I guess you'd have to be,
black officer at your level.

28:40.544 --> 28:43.199
I bet you joined the LAPD

28:43.243 --> 28:46.115
thinking you'd change the system
from within.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.161
How's that working?

28:50.293 --> 28:53.209
We want the same thing.
We've tried it your way.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.429
Now we try it mine.

28:55.472 --> 28:58.649
Burn it all down and rebuild
from the ashes.

29:00.173 --> 29:03.176
Oh, no! You found me.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.744
Let's see how cocky you are
when you ain't got a mask

29:05.787 --> 29:07.267
or a camera to hide behind.

29:07.310 --> 29:09.225
Good luck with that, Sergeant.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.402
Sun's getting low.
Less than two hours left.

29:12.446 --> 29:15.101
Tick... tock.

29:15.144 --> 29:18.669
You know, I almost hope
they don't pay.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.194
It'll be more fun that way.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.110
HICKS:
A press conference?

29:24.153 --> 29:26.547
All of us. Together.
A united front.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.288
Tell the Emancipators
we won't pay.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.072
Did you not see
what happened to DeWitt?

29:30.116 --> 29:31.073
DeWitt didn't pay,

29:31.117 --> 29:32.422
and his employee is safe.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.685
As far as I can tell,
he got off scot-free.

29:34.729 --> 29:35.904
His building notwithstanding.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.124
He's lucky SWAT got there
in time to ensure

29:38.167 --> 29:39.647
nobody died because
of his actions.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.083
Commander, I want
more than anything

29:41.127 --> 29:42.911
for you to find our employees

29:42.955 --> 29:44.565
and make this problem go away.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.306
But it's our heads
on the chopping block.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.308
We need to get out
in front of this.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.483
We wanted to tell you in advance

29:49.526 --> 29:51.137
so you could prepare
for the fallout.

29:51.180 --> 29:55.315
I'm sorry, Robert. I tried
to talk them out of it.

29:55.358 --> 29:58.797
I'll station one of my squads
at each of your offices.

30:11.374 --> 30:14.116
Kate Stein. Booked for
disorderly conduct

30:14.160 --> 30:16.118
for protesting an oil pipeline
at Stanford. Wow.

30:16.162 --> 30:19.382
Where you were a, uh,
theater major. How fitting.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.342
Is that you, Kate?

30:22.385 --> 30:24.126
Don't use that name.

30:24.170 --> 30:27.129
Let's see, before that,
Westfield Prep in Marin,

30:27.173 --> 30:29.349
where your family had their name
on the side of a building.

30:29.392 --> 30:32.134
Tell me something, how does
daddy's little rich girl

30:32.178 --> 30:33.744
fall in with these lowlifes?

30:33.788 --> 30:36.008
I renounced my family name
three years ago.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.358
They're no better than those
corporate stooges hiding out

30:38.401 --> 30:40.403
in Caldow Pharmaceutical's
high-rise right now.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.231
How are you any different,

30:42.275 --> 30:44.233
threatening to kill hardworking
men and women for cash?

30:44.277 --> 30:46.279
For social change.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.715
Tell us where
the hostages are, Kate.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.196
I said don't use that name.

30:50.239 --> 30:53.199
Call me Gelina.

30:53.242 --> 30:57.203
You know, you guys are something
else with these names and masks.

30:57.246 --> 30:59.205
You think we're supposed
to take you seriously?

30:59.248 --> 31:02.034
You're nothing but trick
or treaters with guns.

31:02.077 --> 31:05.341
It's a mistake
to underestimate him.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.387
Who? Cinque?

31:07.430 --> 31:09.215
He's chosen.HONDO: Chosen, huh?

31:09.258 --> 31:13.306
What, like Manson?
Koresh, Jim Jones?

31:13.349 --> 31:16.222
How'd things turn out
for their followers, Kate?

31:16.265 --> 31:18.702
See, I got another theory.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.269
Cinque is using all of you

31:20.313 --> 31:22.141
and convinced you to
take the fall for him

31:22.184 --> 31:24.447
while he nets millions.Honestly, I expected
a Stanford grad

31:24.491 --> 31:26.536
to be smarter, Kate.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.538
Don't... use...

31:28.582 --> 31:31.019
that... name.Listen to me,
you tell me

31:31.063 --> 31:33.630
where the hostages are
and then you're...Oh, the hostages, the hostages!

31:33.674 --> 31:35.415
It's not about the hostages.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.243
It's about cutting
the head off the snake!

31:40.507 --> 31:42.422
The CEOs.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.428
The Emancipators
have targeted you.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.038
We need to get you all
to safety.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.518
Where's your protection detail?

31:51.561 --> 31:53.259
Preparing the lobby
for the press conference.

31:53.302 --> 31:56.262
Robert, there's no way
anyone can get in here.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.350
Look, if this is
some way to delay

31:57.393 --> 31:58.351
the statement...

31:58.394 --> 31:59.569
Get down!

32:14.280 --> 32:16.021
JESSICA: Hondo, I just spoke
with building security.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.153
Shots are coming
from the 12th floor.

32:18.197 --> 32:20.590
It's under renovation.
They must've used

32:20.634 --> 32:22.723
a construction elevator
to get up there.Roger that.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.638
The last time you thought
you had them cornered...

32:24.681 --> 32:25.726
They had some
surprises waiting.

32:25.769 --> 32:26.857
Stay sharp.

32:32.515 --> 32:33.995
All right, your turn.
All right, you're gonna head

32:34.039 --> 32:35.431
right for that door
back there, okay?

32:35.475 --> 32:38.217
You can do this.
Stay low. Go!

32:38.260 --> 32:39.914
Go. Now, now.
Go, go, go.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.264
Stay low! Go, go, go.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.324
Lights off. NVGs on.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.315
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

33:34.664 --> 33:36.231
Hold your fire!

33:36.275 --> 33:37.928
Deacon!No, trust me!
Trust me!

33:37.972 --> 33:39.321
Hold fire!

33:39.365 --> 33:42.716
Hondo, give me a two.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.378
It's not the Emancipators.
It's the hostages. Look.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.554
You all right?Yeah.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.947
You're safe now. They wanted
us coming in, guns blazing,

33:56.991 --> 33:58.775
killing 'em all,
just like the last time.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.995
It's remote-controlled.
Also like last time.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.128
Deacon, how'd you know?

34:03.171 --> 34:04.912
It's her bracelet.

34:04.955 --> 34:06.174
Her daughter has
one just like it.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.437
Great eye.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.744
Like you always say,
it's in the details.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.966
Get down!

34:16.010 --> 34:17.490
Street, Tan,

34:17.533 --> 34:18.839
stay with the hostages!

34:18.882 --> 34:19.883
The rest of us, move!

34:19.927 --> 34:22.712
Going hands-on!
Go!

34:33.984 --> 34:36.335
: Where'd they go?
Where'd they go?

34:46.997 --> 34:48.956
On the ground!
On the ground!

34:48.999 --> 34:50.523
Down! SWAT!

34:50.566 --> 34:52.568
LAPD!

34:55.528 --> 34:57.965
Take 'em off.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.756
Cinque.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.026
How you doing, Mrs. Mayor?

35:16.070 --> 35:18.768
Been better.

35:18.812 --> 35:21.989
Once again, I find
myself in SWAT's debt.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.818
If there is anything I can do,

35:24.861 --> 35:27.386
please just ask.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.997
Well, you can convince
the commission

35:30.040 --> 35:31.912
to stop cutting SWAT's budget.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.088
I need my teams focused
on saving lives,

35:34.132 --> 35:36.917
not on barely
just making ends meet.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.832
I'll see what I can do.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.317
The FBI is
investigating connections

35:45.360 --> 35:46.883
between Kate Stein

35:46.927 --> 35:48.885
and the original suspect
that took his own life.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.844
If there are any more
Emancipators left out there,

35:50.887 --> 35:52.150
the Feds will find them.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.499
Let's hope so.

35:53.542 --> 35:56.023
Hey, about earlier,

35:56.066 --> 35:57.546
you checking up on me--

35:57.590 --> 35:59.896
I appreciate it.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.550
I'm gonna do better.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.205
LUCA: Hey.
What's going on?

36:04.249 --> 36:06.860
Uh, we were just saying we
should all go and get a drink,

36:06.903 --> 36:08.862
celebrate.Luca, your place?

36:08.905 --> 36:10.124
You serious?

36:10.168 --> 36:12.126
What about CrossFit? Date night?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.084
I just talked to Ty
and Kira. Date night,

36:14.128 --> 36:16.304
it ended an hour ago,
so I'm free.And there's no way

36:16.348 --> 36:18.132
I'm working out
after running all those stairs.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.308
Oh, man. Hey, Deac.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.570
Hey, you still got

36:21.614 --> 36:23.268
that moonlight gig?
Deac.

36:23.311 --> 36:26.575
Uh, sorry, Luca,
not tonight.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.577
I should go see my family.All right.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.362
Understood.
But the rest of you good to go?

36:30.405 --> 36:32.277
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
In fact,

36:32.320 --> 36:34.801
we got something special
planned.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.327
STREET:
Here it is.

36:39.371 --> 36:42.025
No way. This is just like
the one from Charlie's, man.

36:42.069 --> 36:45.464
No, no, no. Luca,
that isthe one from Charlie's.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.466
No! No!:
Yeah.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.468
Yeah, man. We all chipped in.Oh, man.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.774
Sarzo picked it up
earlier today.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.385
Holy...You know what?

36:53.428 --> 36:55.038
I got to say, for a while,

36:55.082 --> 36:56.779
I didn't know why
you bought the house.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.041
But now I get it.

36:58.085 --> 37:00.435
You bought it for all of us.

37:02.872 --> 37:05.614
So, let's get
this party started.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.790
All right, man.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.619
See what you got.Let's get this going. Yeah!

37:10.663 --> 37:13.274
ANNIE: Lila, I already
checked the closet,

37:13.318 --> 37:16.234
under the bed and in the toilet.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.714
There's nothing to be afraid of.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.195
You're home?

37:21.239 --> 37:24.590
I thought you'd be working
one gig or the other.

37:24.633 --> 37:29.725
No, I cancelled.
I, uh, missed my family.

37:31.074 --> 37:34.513
What's wrong?

37:36.950 --> 37:39.039
Can we afford for you
to take the night off?

37:41.520 --> 37:43.217
I feel terrible
even saying that, I...

37:43.261 --> 37:46.176
Yeah, look. A-Annie, look at me.

37:48.178 --> 37:49.702
We're fine.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.704
We're going
to be fine.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.793
I've got this under control.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.062
I promise.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.328
Come here.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.423
LUCA: Here we go,
here we go.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.164
STREET: Hey, so when's that
turn you promised me,

38:17.207 --> 38:18.557
like, three turns ago?:
Okay, okay.

38:18.600 --> 38:19.949
All right.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.169
Hondo.

38:22.212 --> 38:23.388
Hey, Luca.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.259
Can I come in?LUCA: Yeah, yeah.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.522
Get in, man. Hey, you guys.Yo.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.263
Yo, what's up, Hondo?
Hey.What's going on?

38:29.307 --> 38:31.091
We never did our team
debrief after tonight,

38:31.134 --> 38:34.442
so, gather around.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.926
I know Deacon's not here,
so I'll talk to him later, um...

38:39.969 --> 38:42.232
Look, I don't know,
I mean, maybe I should be

38:42.276 --> 38:47.368
talking to my mother or, um,
Dr. Wendy about this, but...

38:47.412 --> 38:51.241
These last few months,

38:51.285 --> 38:53.766
I've been tired.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.072
Really tired.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.466
I spend the nights
replaying the days,

38:58.510 --> 39:00.381
trying to figure out
ways to improve.

39:01.469 --> 39:05.952
Get better, be perfect.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.868
Well, we all know perfect
ain't possible.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.566
But the fact is, even if
we could be a hundred percent,

39:11.610 --> 39:15.048
we still wouldn't be able
to save everyone.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.658
That's the gig.

39:16.702 --> 39:20.096
But honestly, for me,

39:20.140 --> 39:23.970
the wins haven't been making up
for the losses lately.

39:24.013 --> 39:28.104
I've, uh, I've just got this,
uh, restless feeling

39:28.148 --> 39:29.367
inside of me
that I can't get ahold of,

39:29.410 --> 39:31.020
and today,
I let it get the best of me,

39:31.064 --> 39:33.240
and I took it out on all of you.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.721
And for that, I am really sorry.

39:35.764 --> 39:37.940
And look, it's still gonna take
me some time to figure it out,

39:37.984 --> 39:39.681
but I just want
you guys to know,

39:39.725 --> 39:42.684
the only reason that I can get
back up on this-this...

39:42.728 --> 39:46.949
...this hamster wheel each day
and do what we do

39:46.993 --> 39:48.777
is because of y'all.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.391
I'll never be able
to thank you enough for that.

39:56.350 --> 39:59.179
Hey. Anything you need, Hondo.

39:59.222 --> 40:02.225
We're always here for you, man.Yeah.

40:02.269 --> 40:03.488
Yeah.Yeah, yeah.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.228
CHRIS:
Yeah. Always.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.056
Look, I didn't mean
to mess up your vibe.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.188
No, no, come on.
Stay for a beer, bro.No...

40:08.231 --> 40:09.363
Let's go.
No, no. Luca,

40:09.407 --> 40:10.582
Come on.I appreciate,
I appreciate it,

40:10.625 --> 40:11.757
but, uh, maybe next time.
All right?

40:11.800 --> 40:13.062
But hey, hey,

40:13.106 --> 40:14.368
the pad's looking right.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.152
LUCA :
Yeah.

40:16.196 --> 40:18.024
STREET: Yeah.
Like the machine?

40:18.067 --> 40:19.808
All right, get back to it.
Do what you do.All right, man.

40:19.852 --> 40:22.158
I'm out. All right.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.333
See you.You get it, man.

40:23.377 --> 40:24.987
All right.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.217
Hello?

40:37.260 --> 40:39.611
CINQUE :
Did you enjoy the show?

40:39.654 --> 40:41.351
Come now, Sergeant.

40:41.395 --> 40:43.745
Surely you didn't think
this was over.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.921
It takes a special type
of coward to have your lackeys

40:45.965 --> 40:47.923
take the fall for you
while you cash in.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.490
Oh, they were eager to do it.

40:49.534 --> 40:50.839
They're serving
the greater purpose.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.712
And what sick purpose is that?

40:53.755 --> 40:55.235
Marketing, Sergeant.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.106
The key to any great movement.

40:57.150 --> 41:00.283
It's time to put faces
to our beliefs.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.720
Hey.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.330
GELINA :
We will not be silenced

41:03.373 --> 41:04.940
by corporations any longer.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.639
We will not be silenced
by the so-called police!

41:07.682 --> 41:09.902
Society is dying from a poison
called capitalism.

41:09.945 --> 41:13.296
It's time to rebel
and rise up against it!

41:13.340 --> 41:18.127
Their arrests, their trial,
the media will eat it up.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.216
You just gave me five megaphones

41:20.260 --> 41:22.218
to spread my message
to the world.

41:22.262 --> 41:24.264
Thank you.

41:24.307 --> 41:26.527
Only a matter of time before
the troupe is replenished

41:26.571 --> 41:28.486
and ready
for the next performance.

41:28.529 --> 41:32.228
In the meantime...
enjoy the intermission.
