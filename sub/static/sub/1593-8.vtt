00:51.344 --> 00:53.426
- ( panting )
- ( walkers snarling )

01:05.816 --> 01:07.192
Stop.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.896
Stop right now.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.436
Stop.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.234
I won't ask again.

01:17.328 --> 01:19.193
- ( engine revs)
- Oh, shit.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.370
( groans )

01:32.385 --> 01:35.297
Son-- son of a bitch.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.213
You son of a bitch.
Help me.

01:39.809 --> 01:41.674
Son of a bitch.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.557
Help me.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.347
You crazy-- you crazy
son of a bitch.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.851
I think you-- I think
you broke my back.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.065
Didn't have to be like this.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.196
You just had to stop.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.286
I couldn't.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.954
I don't know you.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.911
But I think-- I think
I'm getting the idea.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.950
You just had to stop.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.211
- Take me back.
- ( walkers snarling )

02:10.381 --> 02:12.212
Take me back to the hospital.

02:14.093 --> 02:17.335
I did it for your friend.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.630
Not after this, no.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.639
Can't go back, Bob.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.051
( bottle rattles )

02:28.024 --> 02:29.639
l was gonna iron it over.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.438
She's under it.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.570
And you've been
out here too long.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.862
You'll die.
You'll all--

02:50.254 --> 02:52.119
Shut up.

03:05.144 --> 03:08.011
(theme music playing )

03:42.181 --> 03:42.215
(snarling )

03:42.223 --> 03:44.179

( panting )

05:47.973 --> 05:50.009
(snarling )

06:14.667 --> 06:16.703
Please!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.663
Let me in!

06:18.837 --> 06:21.579
Please!
Let me in!

06:21.757 --> 06:24.089
They're close!

06:24.260 --> 06:26.171
Help!
They're coming!

06:29.598 --> 06:31.509
Please don't leave me out here!

06:31.684 --> 06:33.220
Please!

06:33.394 --> 06:36.181
Don't leave me out here!

06:36.355 --> 06:38.721
Carl! Michonne!

06:38.899 --> 06:41.140
I had to see it!
I know now!

06:41.318 --> 06:42.694
Let me live with it!

06:42.861 --> 06:44.988
Oh, God, please.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.895
- Wait.
- Help!

06:47.074 --> 06:50.282
Let me in!
Oh, God, please!

06:50.452 --> 06:53.944
Help me!
Help!

06:54.123 --> 06:56.739
Carl! Michonne!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.532
Get back.

06:58.711 --> 07:01.498
Please!
Help!

07:01.672 --> 07:03.958
Help!

07:04.133 --> 07:05.714
Help me!

07:07.595 --> 07:09.460
Oh, God, please!

07:09.638 --> 07:13.096
Let me in!
Let me in!

07:14.143 --> 07:15.849
Help!

07:16.020 --> 07:18.181
Help me!

07:18.355 --> 07:20.892
Please, let me in!

07:21.066 --> 07:23.182
- Please!
- Come on!

07:23.360 --> 07:25.066
Help!

07:25.237 --> 07:27.228
Get back.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.209
The rectory, come on.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.555
That's how I got out.
Crawl under to the back.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.598
Just go.
Take the little one and go.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.771
(Judith crying)

08:13.118 --> 08:15.780
Hey, hey.
You wait for me.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.917
It's worth it.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.923
I'm not going anywhere
until you're gone.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.661
- Come on.
- I can't run anymore.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.622
We're not running.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.470
(banging)

10:05.189 --> 10:07.054
He wouldn't stop.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.561
This change things?

10:10.736 --> 10:12.567
It has to.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.485
Maybe not.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.822
Well, she said the plan won't work.
The guy who did is dead.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.952
Maybe we gotta rethink this.

10:23.123 --> 10:27.207
But they also said the cop in charge
didn't have any love for him.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.368
Maybe you did her a favor.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.537
I don't know if they'll play ball.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.957
Let's find out.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.767
He was a good man.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.477
He was attacked by rotters.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.768
I saw it go down.

10:53.946 --> 10:56.187
Huh.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.695
You're a damn good liar.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.370
We're hanging
by a thread here.

11:02.538 --> 11:05.200
He was attacked by rotters.
That's the story.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.114
You said the trade was a bad idea.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.623
What changed?

11:08.794 --> 11:11.126
Lamson was our shot.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.129
So it's this or you go in
guns blazing, right?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.914
You don't want that.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.175
If this is some bullshit you're spinning
and things go south--

11:18.345 --> 11:19.801
I know.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.135
I know the good ones
from the bad.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.139
Let us help you.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.313
What about you?

11:34.069 --> 11:36.606
You wanna live?
How much?

11:40.409 --> 11:42.695
Dawn's afraid she'll look weak
in front of us.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.990
Thinks it'll tip things
against her.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.081
Hell, it will.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.502
She'll see this trade as a rip-off

11:53.672 --> 11:56.254
if she thinks you took out
one of our guys.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.259
So it's a good thing
Lamson got aced by rotters.

12:08.312 --> 12:10.849
Shepherd, Lamson,
what's your 20?

12:14.276 --> 12:17.063
I need status on that gunfire.
Do you copy?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.316
(sighs)

12:20.490 --> 12:22.742
Licari, do you copy?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.777
Does anybody copy?

12:30.375 --> 12:31.876
Damn it.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.501
Beth:
Something wrong?

12:36.381 --> 12:39.498
( sighs )
They don't always radio back

12:39.676 --> 12:41.962
and it drives me crazy.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.173
Wait, no, no, no.
Beth, no, not there.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.760
Up by the badges.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.387
Thank you.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.561
Is this Captain Hanson?

13:00.739 --> 13:02.650
(sighs)

13:04.493 --> 13:07.075
Did someone say something
about him to you?

13:07.245 --> 13:09.577
Just that he used
to be in charge.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.494
Well, you'll hear
stories about him.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.582
About me.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.664
About what I did.

13:27.683 --> 13:30.425
( exhales )

13:30.602 --> 13:32.638
He was my mentor.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.812
My friend.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.185
lmiss him.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.777
That's the part
the stories leave out.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.532
What happened to him?

13:52.624 --> 13:54.785
They risk their lives

13:54.960 --> 13:58.168
every time they go out there.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.420
Has to be worth it.
Has to matter.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.881
He lost sight of that.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.552
So he lost them.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.299
Beth, in this job
you don't need their love...

14:13.145 --> 14:15.682
but you have to have
their respect.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.893
Otherwise,
the day is gonna come

14:19.067 --> 14:21.979
when you need backup
and you don't have it.

14:22.154 --> 14:23.644
And what comes next?

14:25.282 --> 14:27.694
Everybody goes down.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.114
Hanson lost his way.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.283
That's what happened.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.878
- ( walkers snarling )
-( banging )

14:57.355 --> 14:59.186
Where did you go?

15:00.233 --> 15:02.645
The school.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.980
I had to see.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.770
I had to know.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.864
(banging)

15:22.130 --> 15:23.370
Where do we go?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.335
(wood cracking )

15:27.719 --> 15:30.461
(vehicle approaching )

15:45.987 --> 15:47.693
(turns off engine)

16:03.213 --> 16:05.374
- Maggie: You okay?
- Michonne: Yeah.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.127
You're back.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.843
Eugene lied.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.679
He can't stop it.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.936
Washington isn't the end.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.228
Where is everybody?

16:30.115 --> 16:33.903
Beth's alive.
She's in a hospital in Atlanta.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.035
Some people have her,
but the others went to get her back.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.741
Do we know which one?

16:38.915 --> 16:40.451
Grady Memorial.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.958
Oh, my God.
( laughs)

16:52.762 --> 16:55.219
Let's blow this joint,
go save your sister.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.301
( laughs)

16:57.475 --> 16:59.136
O'Donnell:
No, Percy, tell me.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.926
Should I use smaller words?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.095
Is the directive
fix the hole in my sleeve

17:03.273 --> 17:04.638
too complicated for you?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.681
- I'm sorry. I forgot.
- Well, here's an idea.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.191
Don't forget.

17:10.322 --> 17:11.732
What about you?

17:11.907 --> 17:13.113
You any good
with needle and thread?

17:13.283 --> 17:14.398
Dawn:
I need her. Sorry.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.567
We have a lot of work to do.
Come on, Beth.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.419
( door opens)

17:42.020 --> 17:44.352
Percy's going to be okay.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.681
Nothing's okay.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.936
Are you going to jump?

17:56.034 --> 17:58.446
I wanted to be alone.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.532
You left your elevator key
where it was.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.957
Well, I know you're
not going anywhere.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.038
Neither are you.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.089
You--

18:18.098 --> 18:20.680
you keep telling yourself
you have to do whatever it takes

18:20.850 --> 18:23.182
just until this is all over.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.012
But it isn't over.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.556
This is it.

18:29.734 --> 18:33.067
This is who you are
and what this place is until the end.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.900
This place saved you.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.740
I saved you.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.412
Twice.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.450
The others don't know
what you did.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.619
They think Joan was trying
to get back at me

18:50.797 --> 18:54.085
and that Gorman and Jeffries were
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.420
- That's what happened.
- Bullshit.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.841
I saw the smashed jar.

19:00.015 --> 19:03.883
I closed up my office and | fixed it
before it could be a problem.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.980
You're a cop killer.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.605
- I would never kill somebody.
- But you did.

19:12.610 --> 19:16.273
What do you think would happen
if the others found out?

19:16.448 --> 19:18.439
l protected you.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.492
And we helped that patient.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.744
I didn't have to, I wanted to.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.575
But there's a way
things have to happen here.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.412
- Don't you get that?
- ( door closes )

19:41.931 --> 19:43.307
What are you gonna do?

19:43.475 --> 19:46.342
No, Dawn, what are you
gonna do?

19:46.519 --> 19:49.431
- Starting with her.
- She's my ward. It's my call.

19:49.606 --> 19:54.020
Fine, but your people deserve to know
who they're working for.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.526
So, you gonna tell them or am I?

19:59.491 --> 20:01.698
You don't get to threaten me.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.450
That's not a threat.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.327
But these are the facts.
You look like shit.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.954
The guys were talking.
They think you're cracking.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.864
This is Hanson all over again.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.088
It's time to make a change.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.166
O'Donnell.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.332
You're wrong.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.674
l'm nothing like Hanson.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.304
l was the one who killed him,
remember that?

20:28.478 --> 20:30.890
l was the only one
who could go through with it.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.358
Lower your weapon, Dawn.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.693
All l have to do is shout.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.698
All l have to do
is say you came at me.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.245
Beth, get out of the way.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.537
You're not gonna do this.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.869
You're not giving me a choice.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.453
Go.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.380
We were rookies together.

21:03.555 --> 21:06.137
You knew my wife.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.764
You were here in this hospital

21:08.935 --> 21:11.972
having cigars with me in the parking lot
when my kid was born.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.637
Don't.

21:14.858 --> 21:17.895
That guy is gone.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.446
We're supposed to protect people.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.399
To help them.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.572
But look at you.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.869
You're beating the old man.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.291
You're laughing
with your buddies

21:34.461 --> 21:37.373
about that poor girl
getting raped.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.581
- That's who you are now.
- So who the hell are you?

21:41.759 --> 21:44.296
Somebody who's not gonna
let it happen anymore.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.587
That's not what this is about.

21:48.099 --> 21:51.466
It's about holding on
to what you have.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.135
What the hell do l have?

21:56.774 --> 21:58.901
This isn't you.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.526
After Hanson, you changed.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.779
(grunts)

22:24.761 --> 22:26.467
You think you're better than us?!

22:28.097 --> 22:30.053
Stay in your lane, bitch!

22:30.225 --> 22:32.011
(gasping )

22:33.811 --> 22:34.937
Beth!

22:37.065 --> 22:39.681
( screams, thuds )

22:39.859 --> 22:41.395
( splatters )

22:41.569 --> 22:44.231
(walkers snarling )

22:46.991 --> 22:48.822
Thank you.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.893
It's okay to cry.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.146
I don't cry anymore.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.939
I do.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.494
ljust don't let them see it.

23:39.794 --> 23:41.500
It's from my own stash.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.411
There's no strings.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.419
I know now
why you covered for me.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.599
You weren't protecting me.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.807
You were protecting yourself.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.433
Is that so?

24:05.612 --> 24:09.355
Gorman, Jeffries, O'Donnell--

24:09.532 --> 24:11.443
they were problems for you.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.199
And now they're not.

24:14.746 --> 24:16.907
And you didn't have to do
the dirty work.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.910
That's how things get done here.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.795
Everyone uses people
to get what they want.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.132
You're not the ones
who have to remember.

24:30.303 --> 24:34.171
Is that what happened
with Edwards and Trevitt?

24:34.349 --> 24:36.055
He used you?

24:43.274 --> 24:45.185
I'm gonna get out.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.143
Just like Noah.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.523
- He'll be back.
- He's going home.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.532
They always come back.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.994
They don't ever get far
because they can't.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.780
But really...

25:02.335 --> 25:04.200
they don't want to.

25:04.379 --> 25:06.586
He's going home.

25:12.637 --> 25:16.175
l was like you
when l was younger.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.475
Nobody could tell me anything.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.305
I'm not stupid.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.233
You know her.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.895
And somehow you both
wound up here.

25:32.073 --> 25:34.405
Maybe that means something.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.738
Beth, you can be
a part of this thing.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.654
Both of you.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.493
This is important.

25:42.667 --> 25:46.125
Maybe the most important thing
you do in your life.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.581
And what you did
back there...

25:57.181 --> 25:59.923
Gorman and O'Donnell
hurt people.

26:01.853 --> 26:04.765
The world didn't lose anything
when they died.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.480
And you're wrong
about what happened.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.516
I didn't use you.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.610
And I will remember.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.749
You're beating yourself up.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.337
Don't.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.761
l was stupid.

26:52.737 --> 26:55.023
At the church,

26:55.198 --> 26:57.484
that guy you killed,

26:57.658 --> 26:59.273
his name was Martin.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.610
We had him.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.575
Me and Carol.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.365
Back by Terminus.

27:07.543 --> 27:12.628
Then she went in after you all
and it was just me and him.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.756
I said I killed him.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.255
I could have done it,

27:22.433 --> 27:25.175
maybe I should have
done it, but...

27:25.353 --> 27:26.763
I didn't.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.306
I keep thinking about it.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.777
I remember
when we were kids

27:36.948 --> 27:39.655
and you used
to follow me around,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.908
copying every little thing I did.

27:43.871 --> 27:47.784
What happened to both of us,

27:47.959 --> 27:50.496
maybe it's because
we're still the same.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.457
Just like we were back then.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.124
And maybe that's good.

27:58.302 --> 28:00.133
You're still the same.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.135
And that is good.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.102
I don't think I can be.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.233
Not anymore.

28:18.739 --> 28:20.445
Not anymore.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.537
(snaps fingers)

28:37.884 --> 28:39.590
They're headed towards
the vantage point.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.172
-( radio static hissing )
- Rick: Okay.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.882
Copy that.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.491
Officer Franco.
Officer McGinley.

29:14.837 --> 29:16.338
l'm Rick Grimes.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.965
l was a deputy in the King County
Sheriff's Department.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.342
I'm here to make a proposal.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.261
Lay your weapon on the ground.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.265
All right.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.052
What's your proposal?

30:06.222 --> 30:09.965
You have two of my people,
l have two of yours.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.303
We want to make an exchange.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.015
Then we'll be on our way.
No one gets hurt.

30:19.902 --> 30:22.188
- Who?
- Rick: Officers Shepherd

30:22.363 --> 30:26.481
and Licari
for Beth and Carol.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.238
You picked up
a woman yesterday

30:30.413 --> 30:32.495
after your people
hit her with a car.

30:38.421 --> 30:41.629
Noah, he's with you?
That's how you know?

30:41.799 --> 30:44.131
Yes, he is.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.883
What about Officer Lamson?

30:47.930 --> 30:50.512
He was attacked by the dead
before we got to him.

30:52.643 --> 30:53.974
Where are your people?

30:54.145 --> 30:55.806
(silenced gunshot)

31:00.151 --> 31:02.142
They're close.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.777
Radio your lieutenant.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.456
I'll wait.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.671
Holster your weapons.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.636
You, too.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.082
They haven't been harmed.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.164
Where's Lamson?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.128
Shepherd:
Rotters got him.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.635
We saw it go down.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.339
Oh.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.560
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:43.731 --> 33:46.313
He was one of the good guys.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.021
One of yours for one of mine.

33:54.575 --> 33:55.815
All right.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.825
Move.

34:41.789 --> 34:43.871
Dawn:
Glad we could work things out.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.207
Yeah.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.711
(whispering )

34:50.881 --> 34:52.963
Now ljust need Noah.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.837
And then you can leave.

35:02.226 --> 35:03.716
That wasn't part of the deal.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.010
Noah was my ward.

35:06.188 --> 35:07.894
Beth took his place
and I'm losing her,

35:08.065 --> 35:09.396
so I need him back.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.397
- Ma'am, please, it's not--
- Shepherd!

35:13.529 --> 35:16.145
My officers put their lives
on the line to find him.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.655
One of them died.

35:18.826 --> 35:20.908
No, he ain't staying.

35:21.078 --> 35:23.239
He's one of mine.
You have no claim on him.

35:23.414 --> 35:26.656
The boy wants to go home,
so you have no claim on him.

35:29.545 --> 35:32.332
- Well, then we don't have a deal.
- The deal is done.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.497
- It's okay.
- No. No.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.459
I got to do it.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.219
It's not okay.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.304
lt's settled.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.184
Wait!

35:56.822 --> 35:58.778
It's okay.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.317
I knew you'd be back.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.797
| get it now.

36:25.476 --> 36:27.637
- ( flesh squelches )
- ( gunshot )

36:42.451 --> 36:44.487
( silent )

36:47.164 --> 36:49.246
(gunshot)

36:50.834 --> 36:52.665
No! Hold your fire!

36:55.172 --> 36:57.288
It's over.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.799
It was just about her.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.637
Stand down.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.471
( sniffles )

37:16.693 --> 37:19.480
(crying)

37:46.390 --> 37:48.346
You can stay.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.260
We're surviving here.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.805
It's better than out there.

37:57.234 --> 37:59.065
No.

38:01.738 --> 38:04.605
And I'm taking anyone back there
who wants to leave.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.781
If you want to come with us...

38:14.209 --> 38:16.120
just step forward now.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.647
(snarling )

38:54.583 --> 38:56.574
(snarling )

39:30.160 --> 39:32.321
(wailing)

39:32.496 --> 39:35.078
(sobbing )

39:57.980 --> 39:58.014
(theme music playing )

39:58.021 --> 40:00.933
(theme music playing )

41:03.086 --> 41:05.247
(walker snarling )

41:15.432 --> 41:17.468
(snarling )

41:34.284 --> 41:37.117
Shh.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.490
( laughs)

42:46.314 --> 42:48.521
"Sorry I was an asshole."
