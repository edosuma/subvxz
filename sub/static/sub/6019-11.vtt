00:09.160 --> 00:12.630
I can't believe
I'm going out with this guy.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.798
He's so cool.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.437
Maybe he'll write a song about me.
That would be amazing.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.558
"Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.995
So, so beautiful.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.948
Not to mention your personality,
which is so, so interesting.

00:29.120 --> 00:33.033
If you want, you can quit your job
and never work again. "

00:44.920 --> 00:47.992
Jerry, you have got to come see him.
He is so terrific.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.232
-Maybe he'll write a song about you.
-Yeah, right.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.357
Like that really matters.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.272
So I take it he's sponge-worthy.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.037
Oh, yeah.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.956
He's a musician.
They're supposed to be very...

01:02.120 --> 01:04.793
...you know, uninhibited and free.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.237
Well, actually, he's not that way at all.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.153
-Oh, no?
-Yeah, in fact--

01:12.760 --> 01:14.478
Come on.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.790
-Come on.
-I don't wanna.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.077
Elaine, you're among friends.

01:21.840 --> 01:27.597
Well, actually,
he doesn't really like to do...

01:28.480 --> 01:30.232
...everything.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.477
Yeah.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.033
-It's surprising.
-Yes, it is. It is surprising.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.510
-Does that bother you?
-No. No, it doesn't bother me.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.511
I mean, it would be nice.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.993
I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it wouldn't be nice.

01:51.160 --> 01:55.039
-Sure. Why not? You're there.
-Exactly.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.430
You said he was coming out
of a serious relationship.

01:57.600 --> 02:00.717
Maybe he's, you know,
still kind of.... He's....

02:01.040 --> 02:03.110
It's not gonna happen.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.196
Hey, Jerry. Listen, I need you
to help me get my stuff out of the car.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.675
-What stuff?
-I just came from the Price Club.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.037
-I'm loaded up, baby.
-All right.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.678
What, are you out of your mind?

02:18.840 --> 02:20.592
Look at this.
What did you buy here?

02:21.360 --> 02:23.920
You will never be able
to finish all this stuff.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.911
Of course I will.
These are all staples.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.113
A 4-pound can of black olives,
that's a staple?

02:29.280 --> 02:30.633
Lindsay olives, Jerry.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.717
A 48-pack of Eggo waffles.
A gallon of barbecue sauce.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.589
-Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs.
-$17.50. You can't beat that.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.791
-Look at this can of tuna.
-Yeah, StarKist, Jerry.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.394
-Most tuna don't make their cut.
-This isn't for a person.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.834
It's for Biosphere 3.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.157
-Hey, Clyde.
-Hey, Kramer.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.517
-What's happening, dude?
-Yeah. Hey, this is Jerry.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.159
-How you doing?
-Hi.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.799
He plays backup
with John Germaine.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.234
John Germaine?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.789
That's amazing. I was just
talking about him with Elaine.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.154
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.958
My friend Elaine and him
are going out.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.873
-They're pretty hot-and-heavy.
-ls that right?

03:07.040 --> 03:09.554
How about giving me a hand,
bring some of this stuff up?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.429
Sorry, Kramer.
I got to watch the hands.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.989
My hands are my life.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.549
Georgie, can you zip me up?

03:21.640 --> 03:23.119
Yeah.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.838
-Yeah, one second.
-Well, come on.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.514
All right. All right.
Let's not get into panic mode!

03:27.680 --> 03:30.638
Let's not make a big deal out of this,
or we'll never get through it.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.997
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws.
I think I should look nice.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.072
-My in-laws. Oh, my God.
-So, what do you think?

03:37.240 --> 03:39.356
Your old man can look good
when he wants to, huh?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.750
-I don't like that tie.
-What's wrong with this tie?

03:41.920 --> 03:44.150
-I've hardly worn it.
-It's too thin.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.912
They're wearing wide now.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.117
How do you know
what kind of ties they wear?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.432
Go to any office building
on Seventh Avenue...

03:51.600 --> 03:55.718
...and tell me if there's anyone there
wearing a thin tie like that.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.110
-Go ahead.
-Oh, get the hell out of here.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.759
Seventh Avenue?

03:59.920 --> 04:02.150
George, do you think
he should wear a tie like that?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.594
I think he should wear
whatever tie he wants.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.593
We gotta stop off and pick up
a marble rye from Schnitzer's.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.318
It's out of our way.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.278
Why can't we pick up something
at Lords? It's right over here.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.873
No, we have to go to Schnitzer's.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.428
I'll show these people
something about taste.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.790
This is gonna be fun.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.233
Hey, you'll never guess who
I bumped into. This guy Clyde...

04:25.400 --> 04:27.595
...he's in your friend
John Germaine's band there.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.753
-What did he have to say?
-Nothing.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.388
I told him you two
were pretty hot-and-heavy.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.438
"Hot-and-heavy"?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.831
-You said "hot-and-heavy"?
-Yeah.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.231
What did you do that for?

04:41.720 --> 04:43.836
-What?
-What if he tells John?

04:44.160 --> 04:47.152
Then John's gonna think that
I think that we're hot-and-heavy.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.551
I don't want John thinking I'm
hot-and-heavy if he's not.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.395
I'm trying to get a little squirrel
to come over to me here.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.028
I don't wanna make any
big, sudden movements.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.715
-I'll frighten him away.
-Well, Clyde might not tell him.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.271
How do you know that?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.356
I should have helped Kramer
with those packages.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.312
-I'll give you a hand.
-Thanks.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.948
Hey, Kramer, I wonder,
could you do me a favour?

05:21.120 --> 05:23.759
I'm taking the family
to Disney World next week.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.390
-I wonder, can you pick up my mail?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

05:27.560 --> 05:31.030
In fact, you know what, how'd you
like my hansom-cab for the week?

05:31.400 --> 05:34.198
-Drive the horse?
-lt'll just be sitting there.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.669
You can really clean up.
Five hundred bucks a day.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.512
I'll split it with you.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.477
Giddyup.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.270
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.113
Why are you complimenting her?
She didn't make it. Rowena did.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.953
-What is this thing anyway?
-It's Cornish game hen.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.518
-What is that, like a little chicken?
-No, it's not a little chicken.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.799
-"Little chicken." No, it's a game bird.
-Game bird?

06:07.960 --> 06:10.997
-What do you mean, like, you hunt it?
-Yes.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.198
How hard can it be to kill this thing?

06:14.920 --> 06:18.993
I couldn't help but notice,
but you have quite a library in there.

06:19.920 --> 06:24.710
If I had a dime for every book
he's actually read...

06:24.880 --> 06:26.711
...I'd be broke.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.359
-More wine, anyone?
-Yeah, I'll take more. Thank you.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.080
-How do you like the merlot?
-Merlot? I never heard of it.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.879
-Did they just invent it?
-Oh, brother.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.317
She's heard of the merlot.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.517
Let me understand.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.593
You got the hen, the chicken
and the rooster.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.990
The rooster goes with the chicken.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.037
So who's having sex with the hen?

06:50.720 --> 06:53.553
-We'll talk about it another time.
-But you see my point here?

06:53.720 --> 06:57.030
You only hear of a hen,
a rooster and a chicken.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.318
-Something's missing!
-Something's missing, all right.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.995
They're all chickens.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.116
The rooster has sex with all of them.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.269
-That's perverse.
-So has anybody seen Firestorm?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.271
Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.079
Remember when they had
the helicopter land on top of that car?

07:14.240 --> 07:15.514
Hey! I haven't seen it yet.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.672
-lt has nothing to do with the plot!
-Still, I like to go in fresh!

07:19.200 --> 07:21.236
Oh, Mother of God.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.277
And of course, this is Central Park.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.749
This was designed in 1850
by Joe Pepitone...

07:34.360 --> 07:37.033
...built during the Civil War
so the Northern armies...

07:37.200 --> 07:40.556
...could practice fighting on grass.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.192
Oh, yeah.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.872
On, Rusty.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.112
Thank you. Now I'd like to play
something that--

07:52.280 --> 07:55.158
Well, actually, it's my latest,
so it's nice and fresh...

07:56.280 --> 07:58.236
...called "Hot-and-Heavy."

08:04.480 --> 08:05.913
Thank God that's over.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.558
The mother seems to hit the sauce
pretty hard. I didn't like that.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.234
And who doesn't serve cake
after a meal?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.356
What kind of people?

08:15.520 --> 08:18.193
Would it kill them to put out
a pound cake? Something.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.476
So they didn't give you
a piece of cake. Big deal.

08:20.640 --> 08:24.030
It is a big deal. You're supposed
to serve cake after a meal.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.156
I'm sorry, it's impolite.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.153
It's not impolite. It's stupid,
that's what it is.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.995
-You gotta be stupid to do that.
-Your father is absolutely right.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.355
We're sitting there like idiots...

08:35.520 --> 08:38.080
...drinking coffee
without a piece of cake.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.552
What is this?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.550
The marble rye?

08:44.720 --> 08:48.952
Oh, dear, I forgot to put out
that bread they brought.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.112
-We forgot to bring it in.
-No, I brought it in.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.508
They never put it out.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.910
-Where is it?
-I don't know. Where'd you put it?

08:56.080 --> 08:58.674
-Right over there.
-Well, it's gone.

08:58.840 --> 08:59.989
You stole the bread?

09:00.160 --> 09:02.390
What do you mean?
It's my bread. They didn't eat it.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.677
-Why should I leave it there?
-Because we brought it for them.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.559
Apparently it wasn't good enough
for them to serve.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.551
Is it possible they took it back?

09:10.720 --> 09:12.790
Who would bring a bread
and take it back?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.474
Those people, that's who.
I think they're sick.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.076
-People take buses to get that rye.
-Maybe they forgot to put it out.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.834
No, they didn't forget to put it out.
It's deliberate.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.355
Deliberate, I tell you!

09:29.560 --> 09:32.518
-He stole back the rye?
-Yeah.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.194
-Why?
-Why? Why?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.920
Because he's off his rocker,
that's why.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.436
-So do the Rosses know?
-They're all very suspicious.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.955
Why wouldn't they be?
Rye bread doesn't just disappear.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.955
Now because of that rye, I gotta keep
them separated for the rest of my life.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.990
Bad situation.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.198
I tell you what I'd like to do.
I'd like to replace that rye.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.193
-What do you mean, replace it?
-You know, go out, get another rye.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.999
Of course, it would have to be
the same one from Schnitzer's.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.311
You put it in the kitchen somewhere
and say, "Oh, there it is."

10:04.480 --> 10:06.835
Well, there you go.
What's so hard about that?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.878
What's so hard about that?
I can't just walk in with it.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.476
-I have to get the Rosses out of there.
-All right. Don't panic.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.710
Let's just think about it.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.560
The Rosses out of the apartment.
Can't be so hard.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.314
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
Wait a second.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.516
You know, Kramer's
been driving that hansom-cab.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.560
-So?
-He'll take them around for a while.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.395
And it's their anniversary
Friday night.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.232
I can send them
for a hansom-cab ride.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.311
-You think they'd like that?
-People love it.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.040
There's something about
the clip-clop. They're nuts for it.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.430
So they go. When they
come back, the bread is there.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.238
-What about Susan?
-She's working late.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.710
We're suppose to have dinner at 8;00,
so I'll set up the rye for 7:00.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.599
-Beautiful.
-You think Kramer will do it?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.876
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.110
-So I gotta be there at 7?
-Just take them out...

10:52.280 --> 10:54.510
-...and ride around for half an hour.
-Sounds easy.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.113
-What the hell are you doing there?
-That's Beef-a-Reeno.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.759
And I got 50 cans.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.798
-Well, do you want some?
-No. No, thanks.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.270
Jerry, I think I bought too much
at that Price Club.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.396
I don't have any room for it all.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.834
Hold on. Wait a minute.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.195
How am I gonna get the rye bread
into the apartment?

11:14.360 --> 11:16.828
-Put it under your shirt.
-Have you seen a Schnitzer's rye?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.594
-It's huge.
-I tell you what, I'll bring it over.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.355
I'll stop by Schnitzer's,
I'll come by right after they leave.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.835
Oh, well, this is all locking in now.
It is all locking in.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.994
-Hey. Is that your horse outside?
-That's Rusty.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.754
Why, he's outside?
Come on, I wanna see him.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.071
-Let's go. I'll show you the horsie.
-Laney, wanna see the horsie?

11:40.240 --> 11:42.674
You really did me in this time,
didn't you?

11:42.840 --> 11:47.516
First guy I like in a really long time.
I mean, we're getting along...

11:47.680 --> 11:49.796
...everything is just--

11:49.960 --> 11:55.034
--great. I mean, all right,
so he doesn't do everything...

11:55.440 --> 11:59.513
...and then you have to come along
with your "hot" and your "heavy."

11:59.680 --> 12:02.877
-So you think Clyde told him?
-He wrote a song about it.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.600
-Well, maybe it's a good thing.
-No, it's not a good thing.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.034
It's a bad thing.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.478
Do you know what this is like, to have
no control over a relationship?

12:11.640 --> 12:14.791
And you feel sick to your stomach
all the time?

12:14.960 --> 12:18.111
-Do you know what that's like?
-No, no.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.989
But I've read articles, and I must say,
it doesn't sound very pleasant.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.752
You know, one of these days...

12:23.920 --> 12:27.833
...something terrible
is gonna happen to you.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.312
-lt has to.
-No, I'm gonna be just fine.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.914
But as far as your situation,
you're seeing him tonight...

12:34.080 --> 12:36.640
-...so talk to him about it.
-I can't.

12:36.800 --> 12:40.475
He's got a big showcase for record
producers at his late show tonight.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.838
I don't wanna upset him.
Oh, what the hell, I'll upset him.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.114
George, I gotta tell you,
this is a very nice gesture.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.158
-We really appreciate it.
-Well, it's your anniversary.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.799
It's the least I can do.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.111
I just want you guys to go out
and have a good time.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.350
So you think we should
get downstairs?

12:59.520 --> 13:01.192
We got about 20 minutes.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.637
You seem a little nervous, George.
Anything wrong?

13:04.800 --> 13:08.634
Oh, no. No, no, no. Nothing.
I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.394
Just get a little nervous
on the weekends, that's all.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.877
-Could I get a glass of water?
-We've got water.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.715
I don't think we have any bread,
but we've got water.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.638
There you go, big fella.
That's Beef-a-Reeno.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.712
I'm so keen-o
On Beef-a-Reeno

13:27.880 --> 13:31.350
What a delicious cuisine-o
Fit for a king and queen-o

13:31.720 --> 13:35.110
Yeah, eat up.
I got 34 more cans.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.760
Nice night for a
hansom-cab ride, eh, George?

13:41.920 --> 13:45.390
You know, George,
we haven't done anything...

13:45.560 --> 13:50.190
...romantic like this in years.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.356
Oh, my God. It's 7;01.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.159
What have I done? My whole plan
is depending on Kramer?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.072
Have I learned nothing?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.071
How could I have made
such a stupid mistake?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.231
He'll never show up.

14:07.440 --> 14:10.796
There he is. Right on time,
as usual.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.193
-Fifty-three.
-Fifty-three.

14:15.360 --> 14:18.238
I'd like a marble rye.
No plastic. In a bag.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.397
You're lucky, it's our last one.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.957
Wait a second,
that's your last marble rye?

14:23.120 --> 14:24.951
-That's right.
-There's none left?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.350
That's what I said.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.273
Number 54.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.992
Excuse me.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.958
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but I have to have that rye.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.715
It's a long story, but a person's
whole future may depend on it.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.269
Well, I'm sorry, but you should've
got here earlier.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.590
Yes, well, be that as it may...

14:43.760 --> 14:46.320
...if you could just find it
within yourself to give it up--

14:46.480 --> 14:49.597
-You're not getting this rye.
-All right. All right.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.113
I'll tell what I'm gonna do.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.510
I will give you double
what you paid for it.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.989
You're in my way.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.760
Mr. Ross, Mrs. Ross,
my name is Cosmo...

15:01.920 --> 15:03.672
...and I'll be your driver this evening.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.559
We have blankets for your comfort.
I also have hot chocolate...

15:06.720 --> 15:09.439
-...if the mood should strike you.
-My favourite.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.273
Well, if we're all set to go,
why don't you two hop aboard...

15:12.440 --> 15:15.955
...and let me show you
a little taste of old New York...

15:16.120 --> 15:17.553
...the way it once was.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.953
Happy anniversary.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.269
On, Rusty!

15:31.640 --> 15:34.757
All right. Look, I'll tell
you what, I'll give you $50.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.471
Now, be reasonable. You cannot
turn down $50 for a $6 rye.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.591
No? Watch me.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.838
-Give me that rye.
-Stop it.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.719
-I want that rye, lady.
-Help! Someone help!

15:46.880 --> 15:49.599
-Shut up, you old bag.
-Stop, thief!

15:49.760 --> 15:52.957
Stop him! Stop him,
he's got my marble rye.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.790
I'm sorry to just show up
unexpectedly like this.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.349
I know you've got your big
showcase coming up later.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.557
I know how important it is. I know
how hard you've worked for this...

16:02.720 --> 16:07.032
...but I just had too tell you that
I never told Jerry "hot-and-heavy."

16:07.200 --> 16:10.829
I didn't think we were hot-and-heavy.
I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.718
Hold on, Elaine.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.679
-I'm kind of disappointed.
-Disappointed?

16:16.120 --> 16:17.758
Yeah, I mean...

16:18.040 --> 16:19.996
...I was excited
when Clyde told me that.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.156
-You were?
-Absolutely.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.751
I am so relieved.

16:29.920 --> 16:34.994
Listen, I've still got a couple of hours
to kill before the next show.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.390
My place is only a few blocks
from here.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.318
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.197
And you know what,
I've been thinking about what we do...

16:44.360 --> 16:47.318
...and I'm thinking of...

16:47.800 --> 16:51.998
...adding a new number to my,
you know, repertoire.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.152
What is that?

17:22.560 --> 17:25.472
I think it's the horse.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.867
Oh, my God.

17:27.359 --> 17:29.874
How's everything?
You need anything?

17:30.040 --> 17:32.793
This is really intolerable.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.520
Excuse me.
What do you feed this animal?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.636
Oh, you know, oats and hay.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.519
Yeah, they like that stuff.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.794
I can't take this.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.311
Get me out of this thing!

17:48.480 --> 17:53.110
Turn this thing around. We've had it.
We can't breathe back here.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.116
-And hurry it up.
-Rusty!

17:58.560 --> 18:00.437
Rusty!

18:21.120 --> 18:23.236
What happened?
What are you doing back so soon?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.392
-Ask Rusty.
-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross.

18:26.560 --> 18:30.075
One never knows how the intestinal
workings of the equine will function.

18:30.240 --> 18:34.199
Thanks for nothing. Come on,
George, let's go upstairs.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.397
-What the hell happened?
-The horse is gassy.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.837
-Must've been the Beef-a-Reeno.
-Beef-a-Reeno?

18:41.000 --> 18:44.390
-You fed the horse Beef-a-Reeno?
-Well, I overbought.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.073
George!

18:57.640 --> 18:59.198
What's going on? Where is he?

19:00.440 --> 19:02.396
-He'll be here soon.
-I'll give him 10 minutes.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.516
I'm not gonna stay here all night.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.430
-How much did you give him?
-Just a can.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.878
-He really liked it, though.
-Jerry, up here.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.996
Yeah, what do you
want me to do with this?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.549
I can't come out. They're
right by the door. Throw it.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.190
-Really?
-Yeah, it's the only way. Come on.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.429
What, are you kidding me?!

19:25.800 --> 19:28.268
Can you get this horse
out of here? He's killing me.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.477
-I don't wanna go back on there.
-Come on.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.555
Hey, hey. Wait a second.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.472
I got an idea.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.758
No, no. Don't be silly, John.
You were very good.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.952
You just don't have to try so hard.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.270
Good luck, honey.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.913
-Come on. Come on.
-Would you just wait a second.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.753
I never baited a hook
with a rye before.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.550
Your hook is too small.
This is for, like, a muffin.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.879
All right, take it away.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.994
Come on.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.718
Yeah. Yeah.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.318
Schnitzer's.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.955
Ladies and gentlemen,
John Germaine.
