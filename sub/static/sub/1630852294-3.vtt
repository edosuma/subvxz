Just five toddlers between us
and that sweet, sweet jam.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.130
Uh, it's "jelly,"
technically, but yes.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.341
Sometimes it feels like
you solve one problem,

00:50.425 --> 00:54.763
and another one literally
squirts out of the sea,

00:54.846 --> 00:55.764
you know?

00:55.847 --> 00:56.723
Hold my hand!

00:56.806 --> 00:57.974
Let's not blow this.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.351
Speak for yourself!

01:00.435 --> 01:02.228
Hello children!

01:02.312 --> 01:03.980
We mean you no harm!

01:04.063 --> 01:06.608
We are just well-mannered
wanderers.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.650
And we would
like to --

01:07.734 --> 01:08.651
Oh! Ow!

01:08.735 --> 01:11.029
Ah! H-he's okay!

01:12.906 --> 01:14.532
Anyway we'd just like
to say thanks!

01:14.616 --> 01:16.826
For putting the spotted bears
to sleep, yeah.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.744
Yeah.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.621
Are you kidding us?

01:19.704 --> 01:21.331
Why didn't we
think of that?

01:21.414 --> 01:23.792
We'll never live it down!

01:25.084 --> 01:27.170
Yeah okay,
what can we do for you?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.465
Aww, you know, that is just
<i>so</i> polite of you to ask.

01:30.548 --> 01:34.636
See, we baked this baguette
and it's just suuuuper soft,

01:34.719 --> 01:36.471
yet crispy,
if that makes any sense?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.431
Anyway I'll just ask --
Jelly pool,

01:38.515 --> 01:39.641
where is it?
Yeah.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.518
Mm...
give us a moment.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.395
Oh of cooouuurrrssseee.
No of course.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.023
Helen, Patrice,
could you please join me

01:47.106 --> 01:49.859
for an adorable elf huddle?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.861
Did you pull us aside
to quietly talk

01:51.945 --> 01:54.280
about how darn charming
these guys are?

01:54.364 --> 01:58.201
To me that "thank you" felt,
like, very genuine.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.537
They're so nice!
And funny!

02:00.620 --> 02:02.163
And cool!

02:02.247 --> 02:03.289
No, listen.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.250
As your creator,
I say it's a scam.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.252
These are the dopes
the spotted bears

02:07.335 --> 02:09.254
were protecting the jelly from.

02:09.337 --> 02:10.839
Just look at them!

02:10.922 --> 02:13.174
Discreetly.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.467
They know.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.302
Juuuust keep smiling.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.304
Okay I have
a question!

02:18.388 --> 02:19.389
Yes Helen?

02:19.472 --> 02:22.016
Why is the jelly pool
special?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.351
Oh, sweet Helen.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.144
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this.

02:25.228 --> 02:29.023
I need each of you to make
a decoy jelly pool, pronto!

02:29.107 --> 02:32.569
Raspberry, boysenberry,
any flavor you want!

02:32.652 --> 02:34.779
Boysenberry?
Flavor is irrelevant!

02:34.863 --> 02:37.282
And I already said that one!
I was picking it!

02:37.365 --> 02:39.325
You don't have to tell me
your picks!

02:39.409 --> 02:42.078
Okay?
Break!

02:42.161 --> 02:44.163
I get boysenberry.
Eh.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.373
Let's go.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.916
Envy me.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.668
Why don't we just
toss her into the sea?

02:48.751 --> 02:49.961
Shh!

02:50.044 --> 02:51.087
Heeyyyy.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.463
Okay, fellas.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.924
If you follow the direction
of my finger pointing,

02:55.008 --> 02:57.677
you'll run smack
into that yummy jelly pool!

02:57.760 --> 03:00.555
Cool.
We will go check it out.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.810
Got 'em with the ol' point
where it isn't,

03:05.894 --> 03:07.312
newest trick in the book.

03:07.395 --> 03:11.274
Worked like a charm,
just like I -- awwww.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.943
So you went with banana
for your jelly pool?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.778
Absolutely disgusting.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.198
Every problem I ever solved,
I solved with a banana.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.327
Sometimes it
feels like you want me to fail.

03:22.410 --> 03:26.956
Ohhh, hello there!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.124
Oh right!

03:28.207 --> 03:31.461
Elfy oh Elfy,
please give us your jelfy.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.379
Jelfy?
Jelly!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.965
It has to rhyme, I took
a little "artistic liberty."

03:36.049 --> 03:37.800
She gets it.
Tell me, button,

03:37.884 --> 03:41.137
what doth your heart desire
most in this world?

03:41.220 --> 03:44.974
Ooooh boy, nobody's ever asked
me what my heart doth want.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.810
Maybe, banana sodi pop?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.729
Or a banana mansion?

03:49.812 --> 03:53.316
Why don't we try something
a little more existential?

03:53.399 --> 03:54.567
Okay!

03:54.651 --> 03:58.404
I guess I want to be
looked up to! By my --

03:58.488 --> 04:01.074
No! That's fine,
let's keep it vague.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.200
We can get you that!

04:02.283 --> 04:03.409
You can?

04:03.493 --> 04:05.828
For an all-access pass
to your jelly pool,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.664
we will grant you
your wish.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.957
Um, deal!

04:10.083 --> 04:13.086
Wait! Nooo! Oof!

04:13.169 --> 04:14.837
Oooh, you blew it, Helen.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.968
We did it, huh?

04:20.051 --> 04:24.597
Before us lies our prize, and
all shall be wrong in the world.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.725
You know I always thought
it'd be like red, or purple.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.895
Oh, I just I can't
believe this is happening!

04:30.979 --> 04:33.272
Mmm!
Mmm.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.274
Is it good?

04:34.357 --> 04:37.026
Ummmmm...it's, uh...

04:37.110 --> 04:38.111
sinewy.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.363
What does that
even mean?

04:43.908 --> 04:44.909
This ain't it.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.828
We've been had!

04:46.911 --> 04:49.372
You alright?
You alright?

04:49.455 --> 04:52.333
Okayyyy.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.002
There there, Patrice.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.546
Your jelly pool
is beautiful.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.132
I didn't even wanna
pick boysenberry.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.883
I just picked it
because...

05:00.967 --> 05:02.885
because I thought Helen
would pick it.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.555
Yeah it's like,
you can't pick your family,

05:05.638 --> 05:08.725
but you can pick their picks
before they pick them.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.687
Thank you,
that's super helpful, actually.

05:13.896 --> 05:14.981
Bear!

05:15.064 --> 05:16.441
You're on
my foot!

05:16.524 --> 05:17.900
Whoaaa!

05:17.984 --> 05:21.487
If you harmed the baguette,
so help me.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.156
How about a "thank you"
for carrying the baguette

05:23.239 --> 05:24.574
all this way?
Ahem.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.409
We're getting to you,
little one.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.994
Aren't we?

05:28.077 --> 05:30.913
Elfy oh Elfy, please
give us your jelfy.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.707
Oooh, you've got
a little something...

05:32.790 --> 05:35.168
Where?
Is it better?

05:35.251 --> 05:36.919
Wait, is that Helen's jelly?

05:37.003 --> 05:38.129
Did she talk about me?

05:38.212 --> 05:39.756
Did she wonder
about my jelly pool?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.424
Did it seem like
she considers me an equal,

05:41.507 --> 05:43.551
or better yet,
like she looks up to me?

05:43.634 --> 05:48.097
Well aren't you just the most
transparent little elf, heh.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.766
Would you say
that's the one thing

05:49.849 --> 05:52.602
you doth desire
most in this world?

05:52.685 --> 05:55.855
Oh my, no one's ever
asked me that before.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.608
But yeah, that is for sure
what I doth want most.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.569
Ideally, she'd literally
look up to me.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.362
Love the
clear language.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.655
We can get you
that!

06:04.739 --> 06:07.116
Your heart's deepest desire
for unlimited access

06:07.200 --> 06:09.452
to your appropriately-colored
jelly pool.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.621
Deal!
Oh no.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.748
Wooooo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:13.831 --> 06:15.541
Wahahahaha!

06:15.625 --> 06:18.086
I've never felt so alive!

06:25.384 --> 06:28.054
Mmm-mmm!
I, hmmmm...

06:28.137 --> 06:31.682
I kinda miss the sinew,
I gotta say.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.683
Thank you!

06:32.767 --> 06:34.185
Yes, ugh.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.812
This ain't it either.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.403
I still don't even know
what will happen

06:44.487 --> 06:46.155
if this jelly gets eaten.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.990
Do you?

06:48.074 --> 06:51.285
I just hope Helen and Patrice
didn't mess anything up!

06:51.369 --> 06:56.916
I'm tough, but small
and easily pick-up-able.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.001
Barb?

06:59.085 --> 07:00.253
Barb?
Ooh, I'm awake!

07:00.336 --> 07:02.380
I'm up!
Umm...

07:02.463 --> 07:04.674
Barb! These guys
are great!

07:04.757 --> 07:07.093
They'll give you
anything you want!

07:07.176 --> 07:08.594
Oh no.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.931
Great idea,
climb up the tallest mountain!

07:12.014 --> 07:13.099
We'll be able to see

07:13.182 --> 07:14.767
the whole island
from up here.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.103
Plus, aren't you supposed
to be good at climbing?

07:17.186 --> 07:20.356
I'm not that kind of
sheep. Huh?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.944
Heeeeeheeheehee!
Heeheeheeheehee.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.779
After you,
my good sir.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.156
Don't mind
if I do.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.074
You're supposed to say,
"No, after you".

07:30.158 --> 07:31.200
Well you offered for me
to go first --

07:31.284 --> 07:33.244
Hey! Whoa!

07:33.327 --> 07:34.620
Rascals!

07:34.704 --> 07:37.874
You.
Holster your bread!

07:37.957 --> 07:39.417
Oh right.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.627
Elfy, oh Elfy,
please give us your jelfy.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.715
Never! You will never
get this jelfy!

07:45.798 --> 07:48.759
Very well. Uhhh,
what if we...

07:48.843 --> 07:50.219
Give you...

07:50.303 --> 07:53.389
What your heart
doth desire most?

07:53.472 --> 07:56.267
Wow, no one's
ever asked me that.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.061
What doth
I desire most?

07:59.145 --> 08:02.106
Has it something to do
with a tall tree?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.357
No...

08:03.441 --> 08:04.901
Ah!
You know what?

08:04.984 --> 08:08.362
The thing that I doth desire
the most is something

08:08.446 --> 08:10.406
I can give myself!

08:10.489 --> 08:11.657
Hmmm.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.367
Okay we can do this
the Elfy Elfy jelfy way

08:13.451 --> 08:14.869
or we can do this
the hard way.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.747
Give us your jelly,
or we'll take from you

08:17.830 --> 08:19.832
the one thing
you want most.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.084
Foreverrrr.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.628
You can do that?

08:23.711 --> 08:24.921
Take my...

08:25.004 --> 08:26.923
All for ourselves.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.597
I don't believe you.

08:34.680 --> 08:38.392
I think you two are bluffing,
so go ahead and try.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.771
Soooo confident!

08:41.854 --> 08:43.064
Adorable.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.233
A- <i>dorable.</i>

08:45.316 --> 08:46.567
Thank you kindly.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.902
Now if you'll excuse us.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.363
We should have just started
with that!

08:50.446 --> 08:53.366
Aww but where's the fu--

08:53.449 --> 08:57.161
Uh! Agh!
W-what's happening?

08:57.245 --> 08:59.080
Why do I feel so...

08:59.163 --> 09:00.957
Sleepy?
Haha!

09:01.040 --> 09:03.334
I tricked you both!

09:03.417 --> 09:05.336
Well the trick's on you!

09:05.419 --> 09:08.798
You just gave up your sleep
rights forever!

09:08.881 --> 09:11.634
For a snack!
I know!

09:11.717 --> 09:14.053
I saved the jelly!

09:16.138 --> 09:17.265
<i>That</i> jelly?

09:17.348 --> 09:21.936
You think <i>that</i> jelly
is special?

09:22.019 --> 09:25.606
I got news for you,
sweetheart.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.984
It's all
decoy jelly!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.610
Hah hahhh.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.823
I didn't even want
boysenberry!

09:33.906 --> 09:35.408
Well, then why'd you
pick it?

09:42.957 --> 09:46.711
I think I just invented
second-guessing myself.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.007
Wow! The jelly pool
is saved!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.592
I'm so glad we were able
to stop them!

09:53.676 --> 09:55.636
All that hard work
was worth it.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.848
Now we can finally
have our first sleep!

09:58.931 --> 10:00.182
Ohh I can't wait!

10:00.266 --> 10:01.809
I hear good things!

10:01.892 --> 10:02.977
Yeah.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.520
Me too.

10:08.899 --> 10:09.942
Ow.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.820
Huh!

10:16.324 --> 10:17.575
I know what you thinking.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.077
But my sleep ritual
isn't the same as Helen's!

10:20.161 --> 10:23.664
I know, P. Yours
is totally Patrice.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.962
First, a little of this.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.547
And a couple of these.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.552
And last but not least.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.055
Perfect.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.606
Were they right?

10:48.689 --> 10:52.651
Did I give up my sleep
for a jelly-based snack?

10:57.823 --> 10:59.033
Gorgeous!

10:59.116 --> 11:01.285
Thank you.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.912
Can't sleep either?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.930
Every problem I ever solved,
I solved with a banana!
