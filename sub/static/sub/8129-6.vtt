01:01.660 --> 01:02.793
Edith!

01:08.300 --> 01:09.567
Hey, Edith.

01:19.178 --> 01:20.178
[Sighs]

01:20.246 --> 01:22.881
"Dear Archie, if you get home before me,

01:22.948 --> 01:24.482
"there won't be nobody home.

01:32.624 --> 01:36.027
"Me and Irene went to a
women's club meeting.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.996
Love, Edith." What a pip.

01:49.574 --> 01:50.809
No beer.

01:52.077 --> 01:53.311
What in the...

01:54.647 --> 01:56.781
Another note.

01:56.848 --> 01:59.150
"Dear Archie, there is no beer

01:59.218 --> 02:02.653
"'cause I haven't been to the market yet.

02:02.721 --> 02:06.190
"But if I get home first,
there'll be plenty of beer

02:07.393 --> 02:09.493
and you won't find this note."

02:13.532 --> 02:15.133
Come on in, Irene.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.102
Whoo-hoo! Anybody home?

02:18.170 --> 02:19.270
Yeah, I'm home.

02:19.338 --> 02:20.504
Oh, Archie, you're home.

02:20.572 --> 02:23.041
Yeah, I'm home. Are you home?

02:23.108 --> 02:24.442
Yeah, I'm home.

02:25.844 --> 02:27.412
Did you get my notes?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.748
Yeah, but I can't eat
or drink notes, Edith.

02:30.816 --> 02:34.052
I'd say hello, Archie, but I
know you'd rather hear goodbye.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.953
Oh, so long, fare thee well,

02:36.021 --> 02:37.488
aribaduche, take your pick.

02:37.556 --> 02:39.924
Now which bag is the beer in, Edith?

02:39.992 --> 02:42.293
Oh, I forgot to buy it.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.496
That's 'cause you was with Irene.

02:44.563 --> 02:47.032
I'll go right back down to the store.

02:47.099 --> 02:48.699
No, don't, Edith. I've got some beer.

02:48.767 --> 02:49.934
I'll bring it over. Oh.

02:50.002 --> 02:52.170
No, Irene, you shouldn't bother.

02:52.238 --> 02:55.607
Why, no bother at all!

02:55.674 --> 02:59.110
That's what neighbors are for.
Thank you very much, Irene.

03:00.012 --> 03:01.713
Thanks, Irene.

03:01.780 --> 03:05.149
Dinner's all ready. I
just have to heat it up.

03:05.217 --> 03:07.551
Yeah, but ain't you a little
bit ashamed of yourself?

03:07.620 --> 03:08.720
What for?

03:08.787 --> 03:10.655
What do you mean, what for?

03:10.723 --> 03:12.456
Ain't you a little sorry you
wasn't here when I got home

03:12.524 --> 03:13.791
so as you could see me?

03:13.859 --> 03:15.259
Oh, yeah!

03:15.327 --> 03:16.928
I'm sorry about that.

03:16.996 --> 03:20.732
But the women's club meeting
was so interesting.

03:20.799 --> 03:23.835
You know I don't like you
hangin' out with Irene.

03:23.902 --> 03:26.437
Oh, yeah, but it's so lonely for her

03:26.505 --> 03:28.873
since Frank is away so much.

03:28.941 --> 03:32.243
And she ain't had much luck gettin' a job.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.146
And I know how she feels.

03:35.213 --> 03:38.215
Remember, when I was job-hunting?

03:38.283 --> 03:39.517
Yeah, I hated it.

03:39.584 --> 03:41.519
Yeah, I know.

03:41.586 --> 03:44.155
At the meeting, Mrs. strickland...

03:44.222 --> 03:46.991
Oh, I mean, Ms. strickland,

03:47.059 --> 03:48.225
the chairperson--

03:48.293 --> 03:51.729
Ms., Ms., Ms.

03:51.797 --> 03:54.699
I hate that "Ms." it sounds like a bug.

03:57.302 --> 04:00.705
Well, anyway, Ms. strickland says that

04:00.773 --> 04:03.775
women are being kept out of lots of jobs

04:03.842 --> 04:06.610
because they ain't got equal rights.

04:06.679 --> 04:09.981
Well, you know what Ms. strickland
was talking in 2 words,

04:10.049 --> 04:11.382
crapola.

04:15.754 --> 04:18.755
No! We talked about a lot of other things,

04:18.824 --> 04:20.558
besides equal rights.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.360
Did you talk about runnin' a house?

04:23.428 --> 04:26.530
No. Look, they gave these
out at the meeting.

04:26.598 --> 04:27.631
[Groaning]

04:27.700 --> 04:29.934
"Are you being fulfilled?"

04:30.002 --> 04:32.070
Am I gonna get my dinner?

04:32.137 --> 04:34.038
Well, let me read you some of this.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.206
[Groaning]

04:35.273 --> 04:37.675
"To the world, you're a woman.

04:37.743 --> 04:40.678
"To your husband, you're a housewife.

04:40.746 --> 04:43.181
"To your child, you're a mother.

04:43.248 --> 04:45.382
"But ask yourself,

04:45.450 --> 04:48.019
'who am I to me?'"

04:49.421 --> 04:52.056
why should you ask yourself
who you are to you,

04:52.124 --> 04:54.726
when you can ask me who you are to me?

04:55.994 --> 04:57.195
Who am I?

04:58.931 --> 05:00.098
The dingbat.

05:04.036 --> 05:05.569
What is the matter with the way

05:05.637 --> 05:08.239
you're running your life here anyway, huh?

05:08.306 --> 05:11.709
It's the world's oldest
profession, runnin' a house.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.617
Archie.

05:19.684 --> 05:22.453
Is that all I am to you?

05:22.520 --> 05:25.223
A cook, a cleaning lady,

05:26.125 --> 05:27.759
and a sex object?

05:27.826 --> 05:28.926
[Groaning]

05:31.797 --> 05:33.397
Here comes Irene.

05:33.465 --> 05:36.834
Now don't be talking about personals
and sexuals in front of her.

05:36.902 --> 05:39.203
Irene. Room service.

05:39.271 --> 05:40.671
Oh, thank you.

05:40.739 --> 05:43.875
Thank you very much, Irene. Uh,
uh, by the way, uh, Irene,

05:43.942 --> 05:46.277
I--I don't want Edith
going to no more of them

05:46.344 --> 05:48.179
crackpot meetings, excuse me.

05:50.582 --> 05:53.918
Archie, a woman has a right to grow.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.388
And she doesn't have to
be chained to a house.

05:57.455 --> 05:59.723
When I was 19 years old,

05:59.792 --> 06:02.526
I drove a tractor for my Uncle.

06:02.594 --> 06:04.561
He even taught me how to lay bricks.

06:04.629 --> 06:07.498
Oh, what a useless thing to teach a girl.

06:07.565 --> 06:10.334
It was very useful. I built an outhouse.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.971
That is man's work.

06:14.106 --> 06:16.674
Maybe it was a lady's outhouse.

06:20.946 --> 06:24.281
Archie, don't you understand?
Edith is like a flower.

06:24.349 --> 06:27.919
A late bloomer who's just
beginning to blossom.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.989
Irene, that's beautiful!

06:31.557 --> 06:33.691
That stinks.

06:33.759 --> 06:36.494
You wanna bloom, Irene,
then go ahead and bloom,

06:36.562 --> 06:39.497
but do it in your own pot, huh?

06:39.565 --> 06:42.800
Archie, the women's club
only meets once a week.

06:42.868 --> 06:45.470
Look, Irene, you wanna do
something useful? Listen.

06:45.537 --> 06:48.506
Edith tells me you've been
out lookin' for a job.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.174
"Lookin'" is right.

06:50.241 --> 06:53.478
It's almost hopeless trying
to find anything these days.

06:53.545 --> 06:55.413
Well, I wouldn't say, uh, hopeless.

06:55.481 --> 06:58.849
Uh, not if you got, uh, a
little pull, you know?

06:58.917 --> 07:02.253
Uh, like, uh, old lady
daly, the bookkeeper's job

07:02.321 --> 07:03.988
is openin' up down at my plant.

07:04.056 --> 07:05.323
Oh, my!

07:05.390 --> 07:08.693
Is Mrs. daly finally retiring?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.227
No, she ran away with a Greek.

07:11.496 --> 07:15.332
Are you saying that maybe
they'd hire Irene?

07:15.400 --> 07:18.569
Well, uh, can you handle ledgers and that?

07:18.637 --> 07:20.437
Yeah, I can even balance 'em.

07:20.505 --> 07:22.106
I've done accounting.

07:22.174 --> 07:24.309
Well, great, then. Why don't
you come down to the plant,

07:24.376 --> 07:27.912
11:00 in the morn, I'll personally
introduce you to personnel manager.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.180
Oh, that's great.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.548
Archie, I don't know what to say.

07:30.615 --> 07:32.350
That'll be terrific. Yeah.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.451
Thank you.

07:33.518 --> 07:35.219
All right, jeez, Irene. Take it easy.

07:35.287 --> 07:37.555
Don't do that when you see
me down at the plant, huh,

07:37.622 --> 07:39.424
'cause kissin', that...

07:39.491 --> 07:42.360
It ain't allowed, it's against
the health code or somethin'.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.096
All right, I won't.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.630
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah.

07:46.698 --> 07:47.932
Bye. Yeah, yeah.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.268
Bye. And good luck.

07:50.336 --> 07:51.336
Thank you.

07:51.403 --> 07:54.138
Oh, Archie.

07:54.206 --> 07:56.040
That was so nice.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.276
Yeah, dinner, dinner, dinner.

07:59.378 --> 08:02.513
I hope Irene gets the job.

08:02.581 --> 08:05.949
It'll bring a little extra
money into her house.

08:06.017 --> 08:08.319
Yeah. Keep a pain in the
neck out of my house.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.226
You know, there's some really
good stuff in here, ma.

08:15.293 --> 08:18.429
I think I'll go with you to your
next women's club meeting, huh?

08:18.463 --> 08:21.266
I'm afraid you'll have
to go to my next meeting

08:21.333 --> 08:22.767
without me.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.270
Archie don't want me to go no more.

08:25.337 --> 08:27.372
Oh, ma, you'll never change.

08:27.439 --> 08:29.807
Whatever daddy wants, daddy gets.

08:30.809 --> 08:32.543
Not always.

08:35.947 --> 08:38.283
Just tell me once when
he didn't get his way.

08:38.350 --> 08:39.917
Just once.

08:39.985 --> 08:42.153
When he wanted a boy.

08:46.258 --> 08:47.558
Oh, yeah.

08:47.626 --> 08:49.694
Yeah, he's mentioned that
to me once or twice.

08:49.762 --> 08:52.430
He's mentioned it to me a lot.

08:52.498 --> 08:55.900
Oh, but that don't mean he
don't love you, Gloria.

08:55.967 --> 08:57.268
I know, ma.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.737
All the while that I was carrying you,

08:59.805 --> 09:01.472
Archie would say to me,

09:01.540 --> 09:03.941
"keep thinking boy, keep thinking boy."

09:04.009 --> 09:06.877
So, that's what I did.
I kept thinking, "boy,

09:06.945 --> 09:09.079
boy, boy."

09:09.147 --> 09:12.684
Even on the way to the delivery room,

09:12.751 --> 09:16.253
I kept thinking, "boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

09:19.024 --> 09:21.326
Do I want a girl!"

09:25.163 --> 09:26.597
And there you was.

09:27.032 --> 09:28.132
Ta-da!

09:28.199 --> 09:29.967
Hey, ma, d-does Archie know about this?

09:30.035 --> 09:33.971
Oh, no. That's the only secret
that I've kept from Archie.

09:34.039 --> 09:35.205
? [Archie singing]

09:35.273 --> 09:37.341
And don't you tell him, neither.

09:37.409 --> 09:38.843
? Around a flag pole

09:38.911 --> 09:40.044
? I love you, dear

09:40.111 --> 09:41.512
(Gloria) Hi, daddy.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.614
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
(Edith) Oh, Archie.

09:43.682 --> 09:45.215
What about Irene?

09:45.283 --> 09:48.385
Oh, yeah. Did you get her in
to see the personnel manager?

09:48.453 --> 09:50.487
Little girl, just like that.

09:50.555 --> 09:53.958
I happen to be in very strong with
Mr. Sanders' private secretary,

09:54.025 --> 09:56.293
a miss horowitz there.

09:56.361 --> 09:59.130
Who, when she was collecting for the israels
last year, I pledged her half a buck.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.333
Yeah, but did Irene get the job?

10:03.401 --> 10:05.569
Well, listen. I done the
best I could for her.

10:05.637 --> 10:08.272
We don't know. We have to wait for
the news till she comes home.

10:08.339 --> 10:10.674
Oh, I hope she gets it.

10:10.742 --> 10:12.709
Still, I'll miss her around here.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.779
It'll be like losin' a friend.

10:14.846 --> 10:16.546
Yeah, that's the idea.

10:16.614 --> 10:18.249
[Doorbell ringing] I'll get it.

10:20.619 --> 10:21.652
Irene.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.121
I got the job.

10:23.188 --> 10:24.489
[All exclaiming]

10:24.556 --> 10:26.257
That's so nice. I know.

10:26.325 --> 10:28.926
What am I hugging you for? I
should be hugging Archie.

10:28.994 --> 10:31.929
Easy, Irene, in front of the family.

10:31.997 --> 10:34.031
That's really great news, Irene.

10:34.099 --> 10:35.433
Yeah, well, when do you start?

10:35.501 --> 10:36.800
Tomorrow morning.

10:36.868 --> 10:38.769
Oh, Archie, I can't thank you enough.

10:38.837 --> 10:42.373
That's ok. So you're taking over
old lady daly's ledgers, huh?

10:42.441 --> 10:43.774
No, that job was filled.

10:43.842 --> 10:45.776
Then they checked over my qualifications

10:45.844 --> 10:48.045
and they found out that I
have a mechanical aptitude

10:48.113 --> 10:49.113
they can use.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.748
Yeah, you are kind of mechanical.

10:50.815 --> 10:52.916
So what, they're gonna put you
on a mimeograph machines?

10:52.984 --> 10:54.252
No.

10:54.319 --> 10:56.820
Let me guess. Uh, the switchboard operator.

10:56.888 --> 10:59.390
Nope, I'm an on-the-job trainee,

10:59.458 --> 11:01.158
and I'm gonna run a forklift.

11:05.063 --> 11:08.432
What a terrific job!

11:08.500 --> 11:09.700
A woman on a--

11:09.768 --> 11:11.636
shut up, will you?

11:13.405 --> 11:14.471
You're gonna run--

11:14.606 --> 11:16.240
a forklift.

11:16.308 --> 11:17.574
Where?

11:17.642 --> 11:20.411
On the loading platform, with you.

11:22.347 --> 11:24.482
Oh, yeah?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.183
Hey, arch.

11:26.251 --> 11:27.685
[Chuckling]

11:35.827 --> 11:36.994
[Groaning]

11:38.430 --> 11:41.866
Oh, hello, Archie.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.301
How was your day?

11:44.369 --> 11:46.303
My day was lousy.

11:46.371 --> 11:48.038
Oh. Why?

11:48.106 --> 11:51.041
Because your friend, Irene, was in my day.

11:51.109 --> 11:53.077
Just like she's been in all the other days.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.612
5 of them all week long.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.214
And to make matters worse,
comin' home on the subway,

11:57.282 --> 11:58.649
she comes with me, you see.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.818
There's only one seat
left, and she grabs it.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.053
I had to stand all the way home.

12:03.121 --> 12:05.089
What the hell am I standin' for now?

12:05.958 --> 12:07.157
(Gloria) Hi, mom.

12:07.225 --> 12:08.292
Oh, hi, Gloria.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.760
Oh! Hey, daddy.

12:09.828 --> 12:11.729
Hey, how did Irene do at work today?

12:11.797 --> 12:12.897
[Sputtering]

12:13.966 --> 12:15.232
What was that for?

12:15.300 --> 12:16.734
It's for Irene.

12:16.802 --> 12:19.003
She's got all the guys
in an uproar down there.

12:19.070 --> 12:20.304
They don't know what to do.

12:20.372 --> 12:21.372
I mean, they can't be themselves.

12:21.439 --> 12:22.807
They're all inhabited.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.912
You mean "inhibited."

12:27.980 --> 12:29.246
That's what I said.

12:29.314 --> 12:31.415
No, you said "inhabited."

12:31.482 --> 12:33.550
The word is "inhibited."

12:33.618 --> 12:36.153
I learned it at the women's club meeting.

12:36.221 --> 12:39.890
It came up a lot when they was
talking about their husbands.

12:41.993 --> 12:43.961
But I'm talking about Irene.

12:44.029 --> 12:46.730
I never should have opened up my
mouth about gettin' her a job.

12:46.798 --> 12:49.800
And I never meant to get her
a job as no forkliftress.

12:51.469 --> 12:55.005
One of the guys on the job,
petey Anderson was very hurt.

12:55.073 --> 12:57.842
Oh, my! Did Irene run into him?

12:59.244 --> 13:01.445
No, no, listen to me.

13:01.512 --> 13:03.647
Petey Anderson put in for that job.

13:03.715 --> 13:05.782
He was sorer than hell when a woman got it.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.484
All the guys were sore.

13:07.552 --> 13:08.819
[Doorbell ringing]

13:08.887 --> 13:11.255
If I never clap my eyes on
the Irene lorenzo again,

13:11.323 --> 13:13.190
I'm telling you it'll be too soon.

13:15.793 --> 13:18.529
Ah, holy cow. I can't
do nothing right today.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.498
Hi, everybody.

13:20.565 --> 13:22.833
Hi, Irene. How is it going?

13:22.900 --> 13:24.168
Oh, just great.

13:24.236 --> 13:25.669
You know, Edith, coming home tonight,

13:25.737 --> 13:28.839
I felt as if I had really
accomplished something.

13:28.906 --> 13:32.042
Yeah, you accomplished the
last seat on the subway.

13:32.110 --> 13:34.512
Listen, Archie, I'm just busting with ideas

13:34.579 --> 13:37.080
about how to improve things
on the loading platform.

13:37.148 --> 13:38.348
[Groaning]

13:38.416 --> 13:39.817
Don't you want to hear about it?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.686
Yeah, sure, I can hardly wait.

13:41.753 --> 13:43.454
Yeah, tell us.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.023
Well, look, if we built a ramp

13:46.090 --> 13:48.825
up to the loading platform,
I could drive right up

13:48.893 --> 13:51.162
and pick the load right up off the truck.

13:51.229 --> 13:53.364
One move instead of two.

13:53.431 --> 13:55.499
That's wonderful.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.105
That's a terrific idea, Irene.

14:01.172 --> 14:04.008
There's, uh, there's something
wrong with it, though, you know?

14:04.075 --> 14:05.109
(Irene) What?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.344
That one move you'd be cutting out there.

14:07.379 --> 14:08.445
Yeah?

14:08.513 --> 14:09.847
That's my job.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.626
Listen, I-I-I've got some other ideas.

14:22.694 --> 14:24.695
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what,

14:24.763 --> 14:26.730
why don't you do what all the men
do with all their bright ideas.

14:26.798 --> 14:28.131
They drop them in the suggestion box.

14:28.199 --> 14:30.367
Oh, good. Where is the suggestion box?

14:30.435 --> 14:31.902
You know where the men's toilet is?

14:31.970 --> 14:33.037
Yeah.

14:33.104 --> 14:34.604
There's 3 of them in there.

14:40.912 --> 14:42.246
I get the idea.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.315
Maybe I better cool it for a little while.

14:44.382 --> 14:46.383
Yeah, you better cool it for a while.

14:49.521 --> 14:50.821
Well, I'd better get home.

14:50.888 --> 14:53.824
I got to do my hair and nails
for work in the morning.

14:53.891 --> 14:55.359
Bye, Irene.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.527
Bye.

14:57.762 --> 15:00.063
I think we'd better eat dinner now.

15:00.132 --> 15:01.599
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.400
Hair and nails on a forklift.

15:04.736 --> 15:05.569
Daddy?

15:05.637 --> 15:07.237
Yes?

15:07.305 --> 15:08.439
[Sputtering]

15:10.742 --> 15:12.543
[Phone ringing]

15:16.381 --> 15:17.881
Was that the phone?

15:17.949 --> 15:20.251
No. It's the good humor
man, runnin' in the house.

15:23.821 --> 15:25.756
Hello.

15:25.823 --> 15:27.658
Oh, hi there, stretch. What's up?

15:29.227 --> 15:31.194
No, listen, listen, listen to me.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.163
Listen, I keep telling you,

15:33.231 --> 15:36.667
I can't go up to Sanders'
office and have her fired.

15:36.735 --> 15:38.869
I got her the job.

15:38.936 --> 15:41.138
No, no, you're just gonna
have to handle that yourself.

15:41.205 --> 15:43.407
Yous guys, will all get
up a petition there.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.377
No, I can't sign it.

15:46.444 --> 15:48.612
She's my wife's friend
and she's a neighbor.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.814
Now, listen. Get that petition.

15:50.882 --> 15:53.450
And you get it signed, yeah?

15:53.518 --> 15:56.753
And then you elect some
sucker to take it upstairs.

16:00.892 --> 16:02.959
What do you mean, congratulations?

16:06.197 --> 16:08.365
Could I see you a minute,
Mr. Sanders, there?

16:08.433 --> 16:10.500
Oh, sure, bunker. Come on in.

16:10.568 --> 16:12.536
Hey, you're just the man I wanted to see.

16:12.603 --> 16:16.407
Bunker, we got a troublemaker down
there on your loading platform.

16:16.474 --> 16:18.575
That's what I wanted to see
you about, Mr. Sanders.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.043
This Mrs. lorenzo who is--

16:20.111 --> 16:21.711
yeah, that's it. That's it.

16:21.779 --> 16:23.813
I hear somebody's walking
around with a petition

16:23.881 --> 16:26.350
to get your Mrs. lorenzo fired.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.452
When I find out who that troublemaker is,

16:28.519 --> 16:29.953
I'll burn his butt.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.460
The equal opportunity employment commission

16:36.528 --> 16:38.162
has been after us for months

16:38.229 --> 16:40.731
to put a woman in one of
our skilled labor jobs.

16:40.798 --> 16:43.667
Well, we finally found
just the right woman,

16:43.735 --> 16:45.403
thanks to you, bunker.

16:45.470 --> 16:48.972
And now some jerk is trying to
foul us up with a stupid petition.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.975
Hey, you're losing something there, buddy.
Oh, thanks.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.744
Tell me, you know who this jerk is?

16:53.811 --> 16:57.114
Uh, well, I couldn't-- I don't
think I could put my finger on it.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.351
Just what do the men have
against Mrs. lorenzo?

17:00.419 --> 17:02.053
Aside from the fact she's a woman?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.355
Well, you see Mr. Sanders,
that's the whole beef.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.925
I mean, a woman down there on the loading
platform makes a lot of trouble, you know?

17:07.992 --> 17:10.127
For instance, we only got
one toilet down there.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.563
So Mrs. lorenzo, she goes to the toilet,

17:12.631 --> 17:14.999
I got to take a man off the job to watch.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.233
Watch what?

17:19.871 --> 17:23.307
Oh, see. The lock on the
toilet door is busted, see?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.875
And we don't want nobody to
walk in on her by accident.

17:25.943 --> 17:29.346
Well, that's no problem. We'll
just get the lock fixed.

17:29.414 --> 17:32.549
That's good executive
thinking, Mr. Sanders.

17:32.617 --> 17:35.151
If the men have time for stupid complaints.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.421
Maybe the solution is to let the men go,

17:37.488 --> 17:39.289
and fill all their jobs with women.

17:39.357 --> 17:41.491
Oh, no, I don't think you
want to do that, Mr. Sanders.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.059
'Cause whoever this trouble maker is,

17:43.127 --> 17:44.695
he's just making a whole lot of noise.

17:44.762 --> 17:46.496
You know the old saying,

17:46.564 --> 17:48.465
"sleeping dogs bark the loudest."

17:50.435 --> 17:54.038
Bunker, I want this harassment
of Mrs. lorenzo stopped.

17:54.105 --> 17:55.672
We can't afford to lose her.

17:55.740 --> 17:58.408
Having a woman down on the loading
dock makes the union happy,

17:58.476 --> 18:00.177
it makes the department of labor happy,

18:00.245 --> 18:02.746
and it makes the federal government happy.

18:02.814 --> 18:06.249
And since our business depends on
government contracts, it makes me happy.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.584
It should make you happy, too.

18:07.652 --> 18:09.386
Oh, I'm delirious, Mr. Sanders.

18:11.255 --> 18:13.924
I'll go down and get the lock
on the toilet fixed right away.

18:13.991 --> 18:16.360
Now, look, look, bunker. You
the foreman down there or not?

18:16.428 --> 18:17.160
Yeah, I am.

18:17.228 --> 18:18.628
All right, then act like one!

18:18.696 --> 18:21.031
I want you to talk to your men down there.
Lean on 'em good.

18:21.099 --> 18:23.033
Yes, sir. And one more thing.

18:23.101 --> 18:25.869
If you see this petition
floating around, grab it.

18:25.937 --> 18:28.639
Oh, oh, that's as good as
in my pocket, Mr. Sanders.

18:36.314 --> 18:37.314
[Grunting]

18:38.150 --> 18:41.152
Oh, hello, Archie.

18:41.219 --> 18:44.921
Archie, did Irene come
home with you tonight?

18:44.989 --> 18:46.923
No, I lost her on the subway.

18:46.991 --> 18:48.659
Oh, that's too bad.

18:48.726 --> 18:50.961
I ditched her in a crowd of puerto ricans.

18:54.232 --> 18:57.468
Archie, Irene called me up this morning

18:57.535 --> 19:00.070
and she sounded like she'd been crying.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.672
She said that somebody down there

19:02.740 --> 19:05.509
had started a petition to get her fired.

19:05.576 --> 19:07.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.979
Who would want to do a
rotten thing like that?

19:09.047 --> 19:12.316
How the hell do I know? I
just do my work there.

19:12.384 --> 19:15.719
Obviously started by
some chauvinistic moron.

19:15.786 --> 19:18.055
Hey, hey, hey, little girl.

19:18.123 --> 19:21.591
Just cause a guy don't want to work with
the dames is no reason to call him names.

19:21.659 --> 19:22.693
Uh-oh.

19:28.433 --> 19:29.966
That's a rotten statement.

19:31.669 --> 19:33.470
You started that petition, didn't you?

19:33.538 --> 19:36.039
I did not start no petition.

19:36.107 --> 19:38.875
Oh, but you were in on it.
Look at your face.

19:38.943 --> 19:41.578
How can I look at my face?
Is my face double-jointed?

19:45.717 --> 19:49.019
Come on! All of yous leave me alone here.
You, get me some beer.

19:54.725 --> 19:57.194
Can't a man walk into his home

19:57.262 --> 19:59.763
without being surrounded by his family?

20:01.866 --> 20:04.969
Will you get me that beer?

20:05.036 --> 20:09.072
First, I want to hear you say you had
nothing to do with that petition.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.240
[Exclaims]

20:10.308 --> 20:12.175
[Doorbell ringing]

20:12.243 --> 20:14.111
That's the front doorbell, Edith?

20:15.179 --> 20:17.213
[Doorbell continues ringing]

20:17.281 --> 20:20.283
That's the front doorbell again, Edith?

20:20.385 --> 20:23.120
You want one of your neighbors
to drop dead on your doorstep?

20:24.289 --> 20:26.122
All right. I'll get it.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.125
Get away from me, you.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.930
I'll be with you in a minute.

20:32.997 --> 20:35.598
Oh, Irene, the family!

20:35.666 --> 20:37.267
I was gonna do that on the subway,

20:37.335 --> 20:39.870
but somehow I got lost in the crowd.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.440
Do you know what this
wonderful little gubbins did?

20:43.507 --> 20:45.342
He killed that petition.

20:45.409 --> 20:47.443
Archie? (Irene) Yeah.

20:47.511 --> 20:49.580
Yeah, can't you tell by my face?

20:57.055 --> 20:58.889
Oh, Archie.

20:58.956 --> 21:02.092
Oh, I'm sorry, daddy.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.263
Michael, you ought to
be ashamed of yourself.

21:06.331 --> 21:10.600
Irene, are you sure it was
Archie who killed the petition?

21:10.668 --> 21:13.036
Are you kidding? He was a tiger.

21:13.104 --> 21:17.641
He told the men to stop bugging me and
to start treating me with respect.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.444
He even sent a man to the
John with an eraser.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.315
Yeah, that was stretch Cunningham.

21:25.382 --> 21:26.783
Nearly broke his heart.

21:27.818 --> 21:30.253
Some of his best sayings was on them walls.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.656
I'm really proud of you, daddy.

21:33.724 --> 21:35.892
Oh, yeah.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.961
Guess I owe you an apology, arch.

21:38.028 --> 21:40.163
Not to mention, 4 years room and board.

21:42.066 --> 21:44.834
Irene, why don't you stay to dinner?

21:44.902 --> 21:46.803
Thanks, I'd love it.

21:46.871 --> 21:50.340
Archie, I know, feeling the
way you do about women,

21:50.408 --> 21:52.742
it took a big person to do what you did.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.144
Very true, Irene.

21:55.714 --> 21:57.413
But I said to the guys,

21:57.481 --> 21:59.816
"well, she's doing a man's job,
she's wearing men's clothes,

21:59.884 --> 22:02.819
so when you see her in the
morning, just say, 'hi, fella.'"

22:04.755 --> 22:06.423
gee, thanks, Archie.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.226
The next step is to get them
to pay me like a fella.

22:09.293 --> 22:10.894
What do you mean by that?

22:10.961 --> 22:12.662
Oh, they're putting me
on regular next week,

22:12.730 --> 22:16.599
but they are paying me less than they paid
the man who used to run the forklift.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.001
Oh, well, come on, Irene.

22:18.069 --> 22:20.003
After all, it's a well known fact,

22:20.071 --> 22:21.839
men are worth more than women.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.643
Archie, have you been reading <i>playboy?</i>

22:27.678 --> 22:29.946
No, Irene, the Bible.

22:30.014 --> 22:31.748
The Bible?

22:31.816 --> 22:33.516
The Bible.

22:33.584 --> 22:37.654
And in the Bible it says,
"God made man his own image."

22:37.721 --> 22:39.990
He made women after, from a rib.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.324
A cheaper cut.

22:46.664 --> 22:49.232
Oh, Archie!

22:49.300 --> 22:51.835
I'm doing the same work as a man.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.270
And if he was getting paid $6 an hour,

22:54.338 --> 22:56.173
why should I get $5.50?

22:56.240 --> 22:58.775
Because, Irene, you-- you're gettin' what?

22:59.610 --> 23:01.278
You're gettin'--

23:01.345 --> 23:04.214
you're getting' $5.50 an hour?

23:04.282 --> 23:06.716
Archie, that's exactly
what they're paying you.

23:06.784 --> 23:08.818
Like they're paying me!

23:08.886 --> 23:10.554
There goes your rib theory.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.358
And there goes the whole country, meathead.

23:15.427 --> 23:18.328
When you see the day that they are
giving women the same pay as men,

23:18.396 --> 23:19.930
and giving women the same jobs,

23:19.997 --> 23:21.465
where in the hell is it all going to end?

23:21.533 --> 23:23.867
What are you gonna say when a
woman is managing the mets?

23:23.935 --> 23:26.437
I'll say we have equality, right?

23:26.504 --> 23:27.504
(Both) Right.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.739
Right, Michael?

23:35.346 --> 23:37.013
Let's think about that a minute.

23:37.782 --> 23:39.015
Yeah, yeah.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.117
And while you're thinking
about it, think about this.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.952
Equality is unfair.

23:43.020 --> 23:44.521
(All) What?

23:44.589 --> 23:46.123
That's right.

23:46.190 --> 23:48.825
What's the point of a man
working hard all his life,

23:48.892 --> 23:50.260
trying to get someplace,

23:50.328 --> 23:52.963
if all he's going to do is wind up equal?

24:25.296 --> 24:27.598
