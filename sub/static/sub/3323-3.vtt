True enough,
but wolves are highly migratory.

They could have wandered in
from another state

or strong enough memory.

Stiles, what the hell are you doing here?

34:59.139 --> 35:02.347
What am I doing?
God, do either of you even play baseball?

35:02.518 --> 35:03.633
What?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.761
Can you please tell your friend
to use the front door?

35:07.481 --> 35:09.312
But we lock the front door.
He wouldn't be able to get in.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.935
And, by the way, do either of you care
that there's a police-enforced curfew?

35:15.197 --> 35:17.028
- BOTH: No.
- No. All right then.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.318
Well, you know what?

35:18.534 --> 35:20.274

My dad left for the hospital 15 minutes ago.
It's the bus driver.

35:35.342 --> 35:36.843
They said he succumbed to his wounds.

35:38.012 --> 35:39.127
Succumbed?

35:39.513 --> 35:41.970
Scott, he's dead.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.979
Derek! I know you're here!

35:56.530 --> 35:57.485
I know what you did!

36:00.159 --> 36:02.366
DEREK: (ECHOING) I didn't do anything.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.619
You killed him!

36:06.832 --> 36:08.117
DEREK: He died.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.170
Like your sister died?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.335
My sister was missing.

36:15.132 --> 36:19.296
- I came here looking for her.
- You found her.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.092
I found her in pieces,

36:21.513 --> 36:23.469
being used as bait to catch me.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.764
SCOTT: I think you killed them both.

36:28.187 --> 36:31.304
I'm gonna tell everyone,

I didn't kill him.

Neither of us did.

39:02.549 --> 39:03.880
It's not your fault, and it's not mine.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.215
This?

39:06.637 --> 39:07.877
This is all your fault!

You ruined my life!

39:10.808 --> 39:12.298
No, I didn't.

You're the one who bit me!

Because he's the one that bit you.
You're part of his pack.
