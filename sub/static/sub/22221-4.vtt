WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.539
His name is T'raltixx.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.712
And you brought him on board?

00:06.799 --> 00:09.586
He said he could adjust
Moya's electro-magnetics

00:09.677 --> 00:11.668
so that no one would be
able to trace us.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.014
Oh, great. So, he's like one of
those mechanics on 60 Minutes

00:14.098 --> 00:15.963
who says he's going to help
and then he screws us.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.764
Crichton, we have to
do something.

00:17.852 --> 00:21.765
Scorpius has left Wanted
Beacons for us all over
the Commerce Planet.

00:27.987 --> 00:28.942
What'd you buy?

00:29.030 --> 00:31.146
Dried food rectangles.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.150
That's it?

00:32.241 --> 00:33.105
That's it.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.032
A thousand units of them.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.068
Crackers?

00:37.163 --> 00:39.119
You just bought crackers?
-Don't start.

00:39.207 --> 00:43.541
I told them to buy something
else and they didn't listen
to me. As always.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.704
This is why we only had
time to get crackers.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.789
That's a Wanted Beacon.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.296
I saw ten of them in the
market in the city.

00:52.386 --> 00:56.095
I had to get off the planet
straightaway in case anyone
figured out who we were.

00:56.182 --> 00:59.345
Well, it does make a beautiful
souvenir, Aeryn.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.272
and that way we can go
the opposite direction.

01:06.359 --> 01:07.815
T'raltixx is ready.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.312
Oh, yes. Um...

01:09.403 --> 01:12.691
Zhaan has decided to test
T'raltixx's device on
your module.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.613
Wonderful. Wouldn't want to use
your Prowler, would we?

01:14.700 --> 01:17.658
Well, no thanks to you
the module has Moya
modifications on it,

01:17.745 --> 01:20.031
so we can monitor and
verify the results.

01:20.122 --> 01:24.411
The Sentra device I made for
Moya will be much larger
than this, of course.

01:24.502 --> 01:27.039
But it works on the
same principle.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.917
lt programs itself on the
inverse of the power drive.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.091
I'll need someone to start
the module, please.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.918
Yeah, course you will.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.380
You know, I once bought a set
of knives from this guy on TV.

01:39.475 --> 01:45.015
The cat swore to me that they
could cut through bone,
metal, shoes.

01:45.106 --> 01:48.690
Hell, he could cut through
my damn car and still
dice tomatoes.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.891
You know what?

01:49.986 --> 01:51.317
He was lying.

01:51.404 --> 01:54.737
Uh, I don't understand.
If you don't wish my services...

01:54.824 --> 01:58.408
Bingo! Give brainiac
the fluffy doll.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.200
Please. Softer.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.950
Your, your voice hurts my ears.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.416
Okay. Softer.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.865
I don't want you here.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.167
But they do.

02:08.254 --> 02:11.212
So I'm going to start
my engine.

02:11.299 --> 02:15.633
However, I love my module,

02:15.720 --> 02:17.460
so nothing funky better
happen to it.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.091
Excuse me.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.423
Be sure to turn the power drive
on forjust ten microts.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.179
Ten exactly.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.434
More than that and the Sentra
device will overheat
and explode.

02:29.817 --> 02:33.401
ltjust gets better and better
all the time, doesn't it, guys?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.322
One...

02:39.410 --> 02:41.241
(device whirrs)

02:41.329 --> 02:43.194
(engine roars)

02:44.832 --> 02:47.448
...five, six,

02:47.543 --> 02:50.910
seven, eight.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.369
...ten.

02:52.465 --> 02:54.296
( systems power down )

02:54.383 --> 02:57.295
Zhaan:
Oh, by the goddess, it worked.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.502
See? Nothing happened.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.212
(laughing)

03:02.850 --> 03:04.806
What? What are you all
looking at?

03:12.109 --> 03:14.270
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:14.362 --> 03:17.525
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:17.615 --> 03:20.277
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:20.368 --> 03:23.952
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:24.038 --> 03:24.788
Help me.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.328
Listen, please.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.246
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:28.334 --> 03:32.373
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.829
I'm doing everything I can.

03:34.924 --> 03:37.757
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.813
Nope. I don't like it either,
but he did it.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.147
My module disappeared,
I disappeared.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.324
How is your module?
-Checked out fine.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.400
I checked out fine.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.827
While vaguely concerned
about you,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.826
I'm much more interested in
how this will affect Moya.

04:09.917 --> 04:14.081
Look, T'raltixx's device may
be our only way past the
bounty hunters

04:14.171 --> 04:16.082
that Scorpius is going
to send after us.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.835
That may be, but I don't
think it's wise

04:18.926 --> 04:21.838
to go to the transformation
yards on this planet.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.545
Besides, you can't build a
device out here. It's too big.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.005
Do you trust him?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.385
You seen him? He's blind.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.467
He's got a big head,
but he's blind.

04:29.562 --> 04:33.225
Barring the Yoda factor,
if he gives us any trouble,
we lock him up.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.977
But do you trust him?

04:36.068 --> 04:39.105
Hell, no. I don't trust him.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.652
Do I look stupid to you?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.445
No, please, don't answer
that question.

04:42.533 --> 04:46.697
Pilot, you do the long-range
scan on the planet.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.698
We send Aeryn out in the
Prowler to check it out.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.166
We're going to play this
thing safe.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.083
I think it's worth the risk.

04:55.004 --> 04:57.245
Changing course now.

05:04.221 --> 05:09.591
My planet is one solar day's
travel beyond the Five Pulsars.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.016
They're beautiful.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.845
Yes. But I should warn you...

05:13.939 --> 05:15.315
Crichton:
Oh, here it comes.

05:15.399 --> 05:18.232
It's... don't worry.
It's nothing really.

05:18.319 --> 05:25.031
But, as we travel through the
Pulsar Light occasionally, it
affects lesser species.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.903
Well, define lesser species.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.656
Oh, genetic laborers,
ungifted menials.

05:29.747 --> 05:35.083
It's rare that it would
disturb beings of your
sentient stature.

05:35.169 --> 05:38.206
And what exactly does this light
do to those lesser species?

05:38.297 --> 05:40.504
Slight impairment ofjudgment.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.298
Some wooziness, perhaps.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.636
And that's it?

05:44.720 --> 05:45.755
That's it.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.804
The effects are minor
and temporary.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.845
Anybody feel anything?

05:55.940 --> 05:57.146
Nope.

05:57.233 --> 05:58.143
No.

05:58.234 --> 06:00.065
I do.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.647
Oh, I feel good.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.239
The light.

06:04.323 --> 06:07.030
Oh, great.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.237
Two fingers.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.364
I thought you were blind.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.912
I am, but my other faculties
have compensated.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.116
l have developed an internal
radar of sorts.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.293
I may never be able to
read a database

06:19.380 --> 06:22.668
but I can sense motion and
avoid most DRDS.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.509
Hang on a sec.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.177
Pip, whatcha doin'?

06:29.265 --> 06:31.927
Well I'm having sex with
three Hynerian donkeys.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.678
What does it look like?

06:33.769 --> 06:35.976
How come you weren't up in
Command? Didn't you want to
see the Pulsar Lights?

06:36.063 --> 06:39.100
I've seen everything the
universe has, Chrichton.
Don't worry.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.183
l was listening.
The light won't affect me.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.142
Are you saving some?

06:43.237 --> 06:44.397
What?

06:44.488 --> 06:46.900
Crackers. What you're stuffing
in your face.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.198
Are you saving some for
the rest of us?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.193
Oh, well, there's plenty more.

06:52.288 --> 06:53.903
Right.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.334
What was all that about?

07:08.429 --> 07:09.839
He thinks I'm stealing food.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.636
He thinks I'm taking more
than my share.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.759
And are you?

07:12.850 --> 07:14.306
No.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.887
Look, we got to talk.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.735
What was wrong with that one?

07:23.819 --> 07:25.104
Uh, too noisy.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.902
My ears detect sounds
well above your range.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.777
Is there anything further
from the engine core?

07:30.868 --> 07:33.200
Fine. I'll take you down
another tier.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.322
What are you doing?

07:34.413 --> 07:36.449
Finding T'raltixx a
place to bunk.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.280
Well, he's not coming in here.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.286
He wouldn't want to go
in there, Cranky

07:40.377 --> 07:43.210
All of his senses are
heightened, including his nose.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.413
You might kill him
without intending to.

07:48.469 --> 07:52.212
Oh, but, you know, you might
want to get back to the
Center Chamber.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.261
Why?

07:53.349 --> 07:55.135
No reason. Just, uh...

07:55.225 --> 07:58.217
Chiana's eating all the food.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.224
That guy eats and craps his
body weight twice a day.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.022
| see. Hmm. Yes.

08:05.736 --> 08:09.103
...reward for the capture
of John Crichton.

08:09.198 --> 08:12.736
Reward for the capture
of John Crichton.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.782
John Crichton. John...

08:17.164 --> 08:18.449
What have you done?

08:18.540 --> 08:19.825
I haven't done anything.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.748
There's obviously a burn glitch
in the transmission

08:21.835 --> 08:24.121
and I'm just trying to see if
there's any more data on it.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.202
Like what?

08:25.297 --> 08:27.003
Like, uh, I don't know.

08:27.091 --> 08:30.128
Like, why don't you leave
me alone and go and sit
in the sun?

08:34.431 --> 08:35.841
You wouldn't tell me,
would you?

08:35.933 --> 08:37.298
Tell you what?

08:38.227 --> 08:40.218
If there was another
message on there.

08:40.312 --> 08:46.057
Say, a personal message from
Scorpius, offering you a pardon
for turning us in?

08:46.151 --> 08:48.938
Do you have to be so frelling
annoying? I'm trying to
work here.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.441
Crichton:
Zhaan, where are you?

08:51.532 --> 08:55.195
I'm up in the Maintenance Bay,
John, about to have a fight
with Aeryn.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.616
Don't do that.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.241
Remember what T'raltixx said
about the Pulsar Light?

09:01.291 --> 09:02.872
That's right. He said it...

09:02.960 --> 09:05.246
it affected lesser species.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.623
That might explain her behavior.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.421
Get down here.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.169
It's your turn to babysit
T'raltixx.

09:11.260 --> 09:15.003
You brought his fuzzy ass
on board, and he's driving
me nuts.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.758
Are you sure you're
all right, John?

09:16.849 --> 09:18.555
I'm fine.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.100
Just get your big, blue
butt down here.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.698
(groaning)

09:42.291 --> 09:44.156
What are you doing?
-Hmm?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.082
Nothing. l'm-l'm just...

09:46.170 --> 09:47.876
What are you doing?!

09:47.963 --> 09:49.373
(gasps )

09:56.221 --> 10:00.089
Crichton. Crichton said Chiana
was stealing food.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.720
Oh, so you decided to
get here first.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.644
The little malik will eat
anything that's not
maggot covered.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.562
Obviously, so will you.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.310
Huh.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.644
Chiana told me that you would
start to rob from us.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.981
But I'm not. It's that bitch.
It's Chiana!

10:17.075 --> 10:19.532
She's not the one eating here.

10:21.371 --> 10:25.114
But if you want your
crackers so badly...

10:25.209 --> 10:28.246
I'll give Your Eminence
crackers.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.585
Let go of me!

10:31.465 --> 10:33.126
You wanted crackers?

10:35.177 --> 10:36.383
We've got plenty.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.630
You see?

10:38.639 --> 10:39.754
Now eat!

10:39.848 --> 10:41.884
You've got three stomachs,
remember.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.351
One of them must be empty.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.551
Stop! D'Argo!

10:48.023 --> 10:50.389
(panting)

11:00.577 --> 11:02.238
(growling)

11:06.041 --> 11:06.951
Pilot?

11:07.042 --> 11:08.157
Yes?

11:08.252 --> 11:10.914
I think there's something
wrong with Zhaan.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.620
She seems to be in some
kind of trance.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.216
Is she smiling?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.256
Yes, I think so.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.132
She's probably just enjoying
the Pulsar Light.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.929
She's a plant.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.383
Put her in the light,
watch her smile.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.935
May | ask you one more thing?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.728
Yes?

11:30.816 --> 11:33.398
Crichton and the rest on Moya.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.227
Do you like them?

11:36.321 --> 11:40.940
You know, I don't think
I do like them.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.868
I thought as much.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.116
Chrichton:
Pilot? Pilot?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.708
Yes.
-Where are you?

11:48.792 --> 11:50.328
We've been comming you
for half an arn.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.705
Why didn't you pick up?
-I didn't hear.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.162
There must be something wrong
with your signal.

11:55.257 --> 11:59.250
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Have you
noticed anything different
around here, Shellhead?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.676
In case you haven't, let me be
the first to inform you

12:01.763 --> 12:04.721
that people are starting to
act a little strange.

12:04.808 --> 12:09.097
I want you to run a spectrum
analysis to see what's in the
light to cause this.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.018
I'll run a scan.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.097
Thank you so much.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.442
(grunts)

12:14.526 --> 12:15.766
Chiana:
Aeryn, just give me a look.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.567
Aeryn:
Will you stop it?

12:17.654 --> 12:19.315
What are you hiding?

12:19.406 --> 12:20.191
Oh, come on.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.738
Let me see it.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.986
If there's nothing on there,
then show me the whole message.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.192
Back off, Chiana.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.993
Oh, sister.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.945
I think maybe you
should back off.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.201
Zhaan told us you...

12:30.292 --> 12:32.283
Crichton:
What the hell is going on here?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.753
Nothing.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.543
She won't play me the message.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.872
There's a hidden message
on there and she won't
show it to me.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.002
She's out of her frelling mind;
there's nothing on there.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.549
Show her the message.
-What?

12:41.637 --> 12:44.049
Show her the message. If there's
nothing secret on the beacon

12:44.139 --> 12:46.881
then show her the message and
she can get the hell
out of here.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.937
Wait a minute.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.182
Why do you want me to watch it?

12:54.232 --> 12:57.224
Oh. What's on there you
want me to see?

12:59.237 --> 13:01.228
You know what? Aeryn's right.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.733
You're freakin' insane.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.859
Thank you.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.157
What's going on in here?

13:05.243 --> 13:08.155
Go back to your mountain,
Grizzly. You're not wanted here.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.372
They're up to something.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.037
They are.
They're working together.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.239
First of all they don't want me
to watch the beacon

13:12.334 --> 13:14.290
and now they want me to
watch the beacon.

13:14.378 --> 13:18.371
l, uh, I could give a
squirrel's nut what you watch.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.421
Why won't you show her what's
on the beacon?

13:20.509 --> 13:22.750
You get your hands off of me!

13:22.844 --> 13:25.586
Oh, I don't think so.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.217
Crichton:
Aeryn.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.683
D'Argo.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.341
What the hell are we doing?

13:31.436 --> 13:35.099
Look at it. We're fighting
over lousy crackers

13:35.190 --> 13:39.900
and secret messages
that don't exist.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.024
You know, we were never
normal, guys.

13:43.115 --> 13:45.401
Someone want to tell me
what's happening?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.156
Sorry, John.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.282
Chrichton:
That's all right, champ.

13:55.377 --> 13:59.837
Just as soon as we get past the
pulsars, everything will be
back to... normal.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.459
I hope so.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.541
And, Chiana,

14:03.635 --> 14:07.173
feel free to take a look
or not to take a look.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.471
I really don't care.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.136
Yeah.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.263
That's right.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.096
l'll... I'll do what
I want to do.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.897
Great. Okay.

14:19.985 --> 14:23.352
You know, I was only trying
TO BE POLlTE!

14:28.702 --> 14:29.908
You all right?

14:29.995 --> 14:31.110
( chuckles )

14:31.204 --> 14:32.910
Yeah, I'm fine. You?

14:32.998 --> 14:34.704
I'm good.

14:38.503 --> 14:39.959
Oh, yeah.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.912
You're real good.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.830
Pilot?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.504
Pilot!

14:47.387 --> 14:49.628
Don't make me come up there.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.304
Pilot?!

15:12.287 --> 15:14.369
Crichton:
A little. You said a little.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.617
You said the pulsars might
affect judgment a little.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.290
I'd say that this is a
little more than a little.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.289
Well, I'm sorry. I've never
heard of the pulsars

15:22.380 --> 15:26.123
affecting sentient beings
so drastically.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.254
How and why is it not
affecting you?

15:28.345 --> 15:31.508
I think it must be
my blindness.

15:31.598 --> 15:37.218
No one's sure why but the light
disturbs optic neurons and
triggers distrust.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.679
l have no neurons,
thus no distrust.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.265
Just enjoy it, John. Enjoy it.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.476
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have another one, blue girl.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.685
(laughing)

15:46.780 --> 15:49.613
Ionic radiation gives
her photogasms.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.200
Unless she's faking it.
They can do that, you know.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.785
Hey, Zhaan, you faking it?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.406
No. Oh, no.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.829
Well, perhaps we should
turn back.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.328
My device is not worth
risking any of you.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.544
Shut up!

16:01.628 --> 16:03.038
We are not turning back.

16:03.130 --> 16:07.373
I want Moya to stay right here
and go round in circles.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.174
There's no point, is there?
Turning back?

16:10.262 --> 16:12.127
We're already halfway through
the Pulsar Field.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.055
So the affects should start
diminishing soon.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.258
One would hope so.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.013
They better.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.356
( sniffing )

16:31.491 --> 16:33.197
( sniffing )

16:37.330 --> 16:40.413
Rygel, I know you're down here.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.130
(gasping )
Let go of me!

16:48.216 --> 16:50.252
Did D'Argo send you to
finish the job?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.879
Be quiet.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.131
I'm not going to hurt you, yet.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.214
But I don't want anybody
to hear us, so shut up.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.596
No, I don't like you, Rygel.

17:00.687 --> 17:06.683
I think you're a coward and a
zannet, but maybe that's
why I can trust you.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.812
You'll be too much of a
coward to betray me.

17:08.904 --> 17:11.771
I trust you, too, Aeryn.
-Shut up!

17:11.865 --> 17:15.824
Now I've got a plan and I need
somebody to watch my back
against the others.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.284
( beep )

17:18.371 --> 17:21.113
Do you want to volunteer?

17:21.208 --> 17:24.041
Chiana:
Aeryn's definitely hiding
something from me.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.412
There's something else
on that beacon.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.539
You think she's trying to
contact Scorpius?

17:27.631 --> 17:28.746
Through the beacon.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.831
She could be trying to
turn us in.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.257
Working with Crichton.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.675
(growling)

17:33.762 --> 17:35.423
I'm not sure.

17:35.513 --> 17:39.472
The only way to protect
ourselves is to get
off this ship.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.799
Chiana, we...

17:40.894 --> 17:42.555
You deal with it.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.641
Hello, D'Argo.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.472
What do you want, Zhaan?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.307
More light.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.314
Are you working with Crichton?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.145
What are you talking about?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.697
Leave me alone.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.194
Zhaan?

17:58.954 --> 18:00.285
( groans )

18:03.375 --> 18:05.536
She's definitely working
with Crichton.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.833
Definitely.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.037
I'm only judging on my
experience with you,

18:10.131 --> 18:13.294
but I've never seen such
a deficient species.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.671
Have you run the scan on
the Pulsar Light yet?

18:15.762 --> 18:22.099
How do humans make it through a
cycle, even half a cycle
without killing each other?

18:22.185 --> 18:24.050
We find it difficult.
Have you run the scan?

18:24.145 --> 18:28.309
You have no special abilities;
you're not particularly smart,

18:28.400 --> 18:30.436
can hardly smell,
can barely see,

18:30.527 --> 18:34.987
and you're not even vaguely
physically or spiritually
imposing.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.109
Is there anything you do well?

18:37.659 --> 18:39.149
Watch football.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.575
Have you run the scan?

18:40.662 --> 18:44.450
Nobody trusts you, Crichton.
Do you know that?

18:44.541 --> 18:47.078
Sometimes they pity you
because of your incomp...

18:47.168 --> 18:50.080
Mama always said, if you want
something done, do it yourself!

18:50.171 --> 18:52.162
Don't touch my console.
-You want to talk about
incompetence?!

18:52.257 --> 18:54.794
Go away!
-Moya would dump your
ass off...

18:54.884 --> 18:56.624
I told you not to touch...

18:58.888 --> 19:00.469
I warned you.

19:06.521 --> 19:10.605
Pilot, what the hell's
happened to you?

19:10.692 --> 19:12.557
Nothing's happening to me.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.644
Can you see the light?

19:15.739 --> 19:17.604
What are you talking about?

19:17.699 --> 19:20.532
The Pulsar Light.
Does it physically come in here?

19:20.618 --> 19:24.110
No, my readings of it are
registered registered
on Moya's database.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.197
So you can't actually
see the light.

19:28.251 --> 19:31.038
So why are you being
affected by it?

19:31.129 --> 19:33.791
I'm not. Now get out.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.292
I've been in the light!

19:35.383 --> 19:38.375
Zhaan's been in the
light, but...

19:41.306 --> 19:42.887
(snaps fingers)

19:44.100 --> 19:45.931
Hey, guys, I think I'm
on to something.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.225
Stay back.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.018
We're only taking our equal
share of food.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.313
I'm just trying to...
-If he comes any closer,
shoot him.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.734
Look, don't make me crazy,
okay? It's hard enough
trying...

19:56.821 --> 19:59.688
People have been stealing food,
so we're only going to take...

19:59.783 --> 20:03.367
I don't care about crackers.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.784
We do.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.987
We want...
-Food.

20:07.082 --> 20:09.414
Is that what this is all about?

20:10.168 --> 20:11.829
Is that it?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.744
Okay.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.209
Then where's my ice cream?

20:18.301 --> 20:19.211
What?

20:19.302 --> 20:20.917
Where's my ice cream?

20:21.012 --> 20:23.594
Savage, I know almost every
food in the galaxy...

20:23.681 --> 20:25.842
Where's my damn ice cream?!

20:25.934 --> 20:29.552
I have no idea what
"izes greem" is.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.182
Is that it, Sparky?

20:31.272 --> 20:33.524
Gonna take the road
well travelled?

20:33.608 --> 20:34.814
Going to play dumb?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.937
( chanting ):
I scream, you scream,

20:37.028 --> 20:38.734
We all scream for ice cream.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.234
Baskin Robbins, Ben and Jerry's,
Good Humor.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.316
What's your favorite?
Creamsicle or fudgesicle?

20:48.456 --> 20:51.744
Pilot:
T'raltixx, where are my DRDs?

20:51.835 --> 20:53.041
There are none up here.

20:53.128 --> 20:56.040
I'm sorry, Pilot, I should
have told you.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.496
I need their help.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.670
For what?

20:58.758 --> 20:59.964
For the darkness.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.667
It hurts my eyes and
makes me blind.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.139
I need to make light, Pilot.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.714
Bright light.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.265
What are you doing in there?

21:09.352 --> 21:10.762
Don't be alarmed.

21:10.854 --> 21:14.563
I'm just altering Moya's
bioluminescence for
a few moments.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.311
It won't hurt her. Trust me.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.271
Idont

21:19.362 --> 21:22.320
The rest of your crew.
Do you trust them?

21:22.407 --> 21:23.237
What?

21:23.324 --> 21:25.155
Do you trust them?

21:25.243 --> 21:27.905
I... I don't know.

21:27.996 --> 21:31.079
Do you need the rest of them
in order to function?

21:31.166 --> 21:32.201
No.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.873
They get in the way more
than help.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.372
I suspected that.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.203
I can help you, Pilot.

21:38.298 --> 21:44.885
If you help me, I think I may
have a proposition that you
will find agreeable.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.217
Go on.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.096
D'Argo:
Hurry up. You're not
moving fast enough.

21:52.187 --> 21:55.224
Then why don't you get off
your fat ass and help me?

21:58.359 --> 21:59.940
Did you kill Zhaan?

22:00.028 --> 22:03.191
No.

22:03.281 --> 22:06.318
No, she was walking around
all sapped out so I, uh...

22:06.409 --> 22:07.694
(imitates gun zapping)

22:07.785 --> 22:10.162
( D'Argo chuckling )

22:10.246 --> 22:13.113
Now, she was reporting back
to you, wasn't she?

22:13.208 --> 22:15.449
Crichton:
Gilligan and Mary Ann.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.410
Maybe you're Ginger, I'd have to
see you in a wonderbra to know.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.291
Where are you guys
taking the Minnow?

22:20.381 --> 22:22.838
We're just getting off Moya.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.541
In my module?

22:24.636 --> 22:27.343
I don't think so.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.217
Afraid it needs this to fly.

22:30.308 --> 22:36.599
And I've disabled the hangar
doors, so no one is getting
off the boat.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.979
He didn't care about Zhaan.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.652
What?

22:44.739 --> 22:46.730
Uh...

22:46.824 --> 22:50.032
D'Argo, he, um, hejust
left her here.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.986
Yeah.
-You said she was working
for him.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.696
She was. She, um...

22:54.791 --> 22:55.871
Oh, she was? Stay back!

22:55.959 --> 22:58.621
No, Chiana, I...
-No, you stay back.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.916
Um...

23:07.387 --> 23:09.753
I'm not planning on stealing
yourfood, Rygel.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.508
I know that.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.090
Well, then stay alert while I
do this. We need some
bargaining power...

23:14.185 --> 23:16.767
Oh, stop plaking.
I'm watching your back.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.640
Oh, brilliant.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.813
At this rate, then I'll
survive, what?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.640
An extra two microts?

23:22.735 --> 23:26.023
If you don't watch it, bitch,
l'll jump back into an air duct
and you'll be...

23:26.114 --> 23:28.070
Right. Run away, as always?

23:28.157 --> 23:30.148
I never run away. I...

23:30.243 --> 23:32.404
strategically maneuver.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.156
Really?!
( Rygel whimpers)

23:34.247 --> 23:36.704
Crichton:
Here's Johnny!

23:37.292 --> 23:38.623
Hiya, honey.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.291
Go away.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.162
Hiya, kids.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.169
What's going on?
This a French Revolution
type of thing?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.249
Stay out.

23:48.344 --> 23:51.086
Listen, I might be crazy.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.465
Could be.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.172
But I got a plan.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.929
What do you say, we all
put our guns down?

23:57.020 --> 23:59.136
We'll lock them in the closet.
That way nobody gets hurt.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.060
No.

24:00.148 --> 24:03.356
Honey, please.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.357
Aah!

24:06.779 --> 24:09.486
Next time you'll be a
crouton, Crichton!

24:09.574 --> 24:10.859
( Rygel chuckling )

24:10.950 --> 24:12.110
Crichton:
Pilot? Pilot?

24:12.201 --> 24:14.487
Something the matter, Crichton?

24:14.579 --> 24:16.410
It's the damn Peacekeeper bitch.

24:16.497 --> 24:19.580
She's barricaded herself in the
Command. I think she's trying
to take over the ship.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.283
I'm aware of her actions.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.163
Crichton:
Shut her down.

24:23.254 --> 24:24.494
Lights, power, all of it.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.877
I'm sorry, John,
I cannot do that.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.127
What?

24:29.218 --> 24:30.207
Pilot?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.335
Pilot!

24:32.430 --> 24:34.341
Got a bit of a problem,
Commander?

24:34.432 --> 24:35.842
Well, now you've got one more.

24:35.933 --> 24:40.848
'Cause the only way you're
going to get my weapon
is if I'm dead.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.098
Look at what you're doing.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.646
What?

24:43.733 --> 24:45.269
Look.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.100
(laughing)

24:47.195 --> 24:50.858
Yes, you're right.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.325
You're so right.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.149
He's absolutely right.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.451
The power setting's too low.

24:59.332 --> 25:01.323
Thank you! So much better.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.373
You missed!
( laughing )

25:03.461 --> 25:06.828
Crichton. Named John Crichton.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.163
What you doing?
-Named...

25:08.257 --> 25:10.248
John Crichton.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.675
Whoa! Oh, no, no.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.757
Hey, Missy.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.588
Why you messing with
that beacon?

25:17.684 --> 25:19.220
Oh, hey, Johnny.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.096
Well, I'm not messing
with nothing.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.222
Uh-huh.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.603
(grunting)

25:26.234 --> 25:28.190
(laughing)

25:28.277 --> 25:30.654
Named John Crichton.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.148
Oh...

25:33.157 --> 25:36.695
They just don't get it.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.277
They don't get it, Scorpy.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.988
They don't get how
crazy they are.

25:43.418 --> 25:45.124
You're right, John.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.076
They don't get it.

25:48.339 --> 25:52.378
They don't get how crazy
they are because...

26:02.228 --> 26:04.890
because they stole the crackers.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.234
You'll never be able to
take over Moya.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.061
Pilot won't let you.

26:14.157 --> 26:16.694
l have disabled his ability
to spy on us up here.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.196
We just have to hope that the
others keep him busy.

26:19.287 --> 26:22.120
Hope? Your great plan
depends on hope?

26:22.206 --> 26:24.868
What if Pilot pumps
poison gas in here?

26:24.959 --> 26:26.574
We have to risk it, don't we?

26:26.669 --> 26:29.661
In any assault a solider has to
take chances and attack the
nerve center.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.121
Shut up.

26:31.215 --> 26:34.082
I don't need a grunt to give me
a military assault lecture.

26:34.177 --> 26:36.133
I wrote military
assault lectures.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.929
You? The only thing you've
ever assaulted is a plate
of food cubes.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.302
Now shut up.

26:42.393 --> 26:47.183
And remember that cracker,
that older kid, Howie Lewis,
who beat you up?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.098
You were just 12.

26:50.193 --> 26:52.275
It took months,
but you got even.

26:52.361 --> 26:55.319
And you poured sugar in
poor Howie's harley.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.739
Howie had no idea it was you.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.441
Yes, yes.

27:00.536 --> 27:05.200
Revenge is a dish best served
cold and you like revenge,
don't you?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.622
Shut up!

27:08.294 --> 27:11.878
I hate it when villains
quote Shakespeare.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.047
They're coming to
kill you, John.

27:16.886 --> 27:19.593
We'd better get ready.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.763
I need more light.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.096
I'm already boosting in three
additional core channels.

27:30.191 --> 27:33.683
I need more! Please, Pilot.

27:33.778 --> 27:37.270
You save me then I'll save you.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.821
Save me from who?

27:38.908 --> 27:41.741
From the others.
Don't you understand?

27:41.828 --> 27:43.534
They're plotting against you.

27:43.621 --> 27:49.787
You may not trust me, but
believe me, trust them
much less.

27:49.877 --> 27:53.335
Boosting in two more
core channels.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.091
Drop it.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.176
Oh, go ahead.

28:01.264 --> 28:02.925
Try it, Medusa. Try it.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.014
Down, boy.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.967
Roll over.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.318
Good boy.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.483
Go on.

28:21.284 --> 28:22.865
Kill me.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.741
Go on, John, do it!
Then we can go to the beach.

28:27.832 --> 28:31.541
I know a place with naked
Sebacean girls and
margarita shooters.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.413
Go away, Scorpy.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.419
You're not real.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.915
Uh-uh...

28:40.469 --> 28:42.300
What?

28:43.139 --> 28:44.128
What?

28:44.223 --> 28:47.465
Am I being... irrational?

28:48.728 --> 28:50.559
Oh.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.307
Well, have a little pain.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.186
Go on, finish him.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.060
Finish him.

28:59.155 --> 29:02.318
Then we can go to that little
Eye-Talian joint I know.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.284
I don't like...

29:07.371 --> 29:09.282
Eye-Talian.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.329
Don't be a coward.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.281
Kill him.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.913
Not me, him!

29:21.427 --> 29:23.338
(laughing)

29:24.388 --> 29:25.924
D'Argo?

29:27.767 --> 29:29.257
Zhaan?

29:29.352 --> 29:31.058
Hi, baby.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.643
Crichton.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.392
Don't. I... I can help you.

29:35.483 --> 29:36.939
No, no, no, no, no.

29:37.026 --> 29:41.190
I'm still aching from the last
time you "helped" me.

29:42.365 --> 29:45.323
What a slut.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.615
(laughs wildly)

29:46.702 --> 29:48.909
Is this why your family
abandoned you?

29:48.996 --> 29:52.363
'Cause you'd spread them
for anybody, anytime?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.244
John, please. Please don't.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.200
No, 'fraid not.

29:56.295 --> 30:00.334
My little black book
is all full.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.540
John, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.216
Show a little bit of patience.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.170
Tie her up.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.346
Then we can save her
for dessert.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.173
Kill the others.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.101
Then we can have a little bit
of fun with her.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.272
Nice.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.059
I like that idea.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.486
Hurry up.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.612
Do you hear him?

30:29.704 --> 30:33.117
Hurry up. Crichton's coming.

30:33.207 --> 30:35.823
You're going to sell me out,
aren't you, when he comes?

30:35.918 --> 30:36.748
Huh?

30:36.836 --> 30:38.246
You're going to switch sides.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.543
No.

30:39.630 --> 30:40.961
You're lying. You know how
I know that?

30:41.048 --> 30:42.163
Because you always lie.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.498
You have no integrity,
you have no honor.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.878
You cheat, you steal, you lie.
You stuff your face!

30:45.970 --> 30:47.335
That's you!

30:49.015 --> 30:50.380
( screaming )

30:54.770 --> 30:58.012
Hell, hell, hell.

31:01.902 --> 31:04.359
First you betray the
Peacekeepers

31:04.447 --> 31:07.735
and every vow you've made
since you were born.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.611
And now poor Sparky here?

31:09.702 --> 31:11.112
(laughing)

31:11.203 --> 31:15.367
Tell me, Princess, when
you're old and fat

31:15.458 --> 31:18.950
will you have anything to
look back on with pride?

31:20.713 --> 31:23.125
Is that it? Oh, don't stop.

31:23.215 --> 31:27.208
Why don't you make another
speech, you self-important,
deficient little man.

31:27.303 --> 31:30.090
All you ever do is talk!

31:30.181 --> 31:32.797
Your father was the hero,
you know. He did things.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.430
You, you're just a test monkey
that screwed up your
first experiment.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.099
That is good!

31:39.190 --> 31:40.145
Yeah.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.723
That is fantastic!

31:42.818 --> 31:48.279
Coming from a frigid,
flat-butted, Peacekeeper skank.

31:49.784 --> 31:52.321
Kill her.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.242
Then we'll have pizza.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.742
And margarita shooters.

31:56.832 --> 31:58.948
Go on, John. Kill her.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.580
Do it. Do it.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.877
Nobody...

32:03.964 --> 32:06.341
has margaritas...

32:06.425 --> 32:08.256
with pizza.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.420
You're out of your mind, John.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.518
I know.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.522
Are you cracking up,
little man?

32:23.609 --> 32:24.644
Hello?

32:24.735 --> 32:26.066
I'm okay.
Aeryn, listen to me...

32:26.153 --> 32:27.142
Oh, no, no, no, no.

32:27.238 --> 32:30.776
I am tired of having to
always listen to you.

32:30.866 --> 32:34.654
Aeryn, listen...

32:34.745 --> 32:36.531
| just shot Scorpius.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.611
Shut up.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.037
You're wrong, you know.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.706
When I'm old and fat...

32:40.793 --> 32:43.910
when I'm old, there is one
thing I'll look back on
with enormous pride

32:44.004 --> 32:44.959
and that is killing you.

32:45.047 --> 32:48.084
Aeryn, he wanted me to
shoot you.

33:04.692 --> 33:05.852
(guns clicking)
Damn!

33:05.943 --> 33:08.309
(guns clicking)
Dren!

33:08.404 --> 33:10.645
Have you got any spare
caﬂndges?

33:10.739 --> 33:12.479
( both screaming )

33:18.247 --> 33:20.863
Hiya, kids.

33:20.958 --> 33:23.825
Let me go. I command it,
you miserable...

33:23.919 --> 33:27.161
Oh, no one's going anywhere,
not even to Disneyland.

33:27.256 --> 33:32.216
Not before we all have the
breakfast of losers.

33:33.554 --> 33:36.671
Oh, look, everybody,
Sunshine's awake.

33:36.765 --> 33:37.629
Renaldo!

33:37.725 --> 33:40.341
Oh, even on a flesh wound.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.222
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

33:42.313 --> 33:44.019
That must hurt.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.141
Sorry.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.974
Now that we're all here
and so happy,

33:48.068 --> 33:51.231
do you think we can all get
along for three microts?

33:51.322 --> 33:52.152
No.

33:52.239 --> 33:53.274
No?

33:53.365 --> 33:57.153
But D'Argo, I need you
to understand

33:57.244 --> 33:59.326
that crackers don't matter.

34:02.249 --> 34:03.113
Whoo!

34:03.209 --> 34:05.245
Have I got your attention now?

34:06.170 --> 34:07.785
Good.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.120
So, class...

34:09.215 --> 34:12.207
today's assignment is...
anyone?

34:12.301 --> 34:15.088
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

34:15.179 --> 34:17.886
A brand-new car!

34:17.973 --> 34:20.134
No, it's T'raltixx.

34:20.226 --> 34:23.935
T-apostrophe-r-a-l-
t-l-double x.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.761
T'raltixx.

34:25.856 --> 34:30.225
Since it came on board, we've
been fighting about everything

34:30.319 --> 34:33.061
including these.

34:33.155 --> 34:36.989
Now, I've been acting twisted
as well. Still am.

34:37.076 --> 34:40.113
Been seeing Scorpius like
he's guest starring on
Hawaii Five-O.

34:40.204 --> 34:42.741
How crazy is that?

34:42.831 --> 34:45.083
But I realized something.

34:45.167 --> 34:48.955
Friggin' nuts that I am,

34:49.046 --> 34:51.503
it's not the Pulsars
affecting me.

34:51.590 --> 34:55.174
Look, if you want me to believe
anything you're saying...

34:55.261 --> 34:56.376
Shut up!

34:56.470 --> 34:58.426
Chiana:
Frell you!

34:58.514 --> 35:01.972
We are past the Pulsars.

35:02.059 --> 35:04.675
So how come we're acting
even crazier?

35:07.147 --> 35:08.933
Zhaan?

35:09.024 --> 35:11.231
Stop bothering me, I'm busy.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.229
Yes, yes, yes.

35:13.320 --> 35:17.313
Private moment number 344.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.027
Tell them.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.325
You tell them.

35:21.412 --> 35:22.322
Zhaan.

35:24.248 --> 35:28.412
When I was near T'raltixx,
l was more affected than when
I was in the light.

35:28.502 --> 35:31.118
He... he made me feel...

35:31.213 --> 35:32.419
Enough.

35:32.506 --> 35:35.168
Go for 345.

35:36.427 --> 35:40.011
So, I have...

35:40.097 --> 35:42.713
as much as I hate to
do this... oh God!

35:42.808 --> 35:46.801
I have to ask for your help.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.681
No.

35:48.772 --> 35:51.514
(making beeping sounds)

35:51.608 --> 35:52.893
Wrong answer.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.447
I'm at system's overload.

36:00.534 --> 36:03.276
I need more light.

36:03.370 --> 36:06.077
But why? I'm not sure if I can.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.451
More light!

36:08.542 --> 36:09.998
All right.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.205
Can you feel it, Pilot?

36:16.300 --> 36:20.634
All of Moya is beginning
to glow.

36:20.721 --> 36:29.311
I am magnificent!

36:29.396 --> 36:33.639
Look, I want you to look at
what he's doing to Moya.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.059
Look at the walls!

36:37.529 --> 36:38.939
They're glowing.

36:41.075 --> 36:42.406
Look.

36:42.493 --> 36:43.858
Why?

36:43.952 --> 36:45.943
Why would he want us to fight
amongst each other?

36:46.038 --> 36:51.123
He wants us out of the way
so he can create light.

36:51.210 --> 36:55.920
I noticed between pleasures he
has hundreds of DRDs working.

36:56.006 --> 36:58.042
The sluice chambers
are glowing.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.920
I think it's time that we paid
this creep a visit.

37:01.637 --> 37:02.877
And kill him.

37:03.347 --> 37:05.258
Undo me.

37:05.349 --> 37:06.680
Can I trust you?

37:07.226 --> 37:08.215
No.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.761
At least you're honest.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.274
Now...

37:17.361 --> 37:19.818
unless you plan on actually
pulling the trigger,

37:19.905 --> 37:22.362
don't ever pull a gun on me
like that again.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.440
I was making a point.

37:24.535 --> 37:26.366
So was I.

37:26.453 --> 37:27.954
Dont

37:28.038 --> 37:30.279
Stop it. Focus here.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.162
Okay.

37:34.253 --> 37:39.247
T'raltixx said that we're
attacked through our
optic neurons.

37:39.341 --> 37:41.252
That's how he's getting to us.
But I can deal with it.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.176
You just gotta find a way to
keep the light and the
heat off me

37:44.263 --> 37:45.469
and I'm going to go in
and kill him.

37:45.556 --> 37:47.922
You?! We're not sending you
in there after him.

37:48.016 --> 37:51.725
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the only
around here keeping it
vaguely under control.

37:51.812 --> 37:53.598
( Rygel scoffs )
Says who?

37:53.689 --> 37:55.805
Says me, Buckwheat.

37:55.899 --> 37:59.232
You are no warrior.
I will kill T'raltixx.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.525
No, you will not. I will.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.692
You're wounded.
-No way.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.156
I want the first shot.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.196
Look at you two bozos.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.151
You'd kill each other before you
got anywhere near T'raltixx.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.110
He's right. He's got to do it.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.194
Why?

38:11.290 --> 38:13.030
Oh, don't you get it, furball?

38:13.125 --> 38:15.992
Look, Crichton's the only one
not affected by T'raltixx
'cause he's deficient.

38:16.086 --> 38:17.326
Who you calling deficient?

38:17.421 --> 38:19.958
You! You've got the worst
eyes out of all of us.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.209
That's why your optic nerves
aren't being affected.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.417
I got great eyes.

38:24.511 --> 38:28.254
They're better than 20-20
and they're blue.

38:28.348 --> 38:32.011
Okay, so, can you read the
symbols on the basin over there?

38:34.396 --> 38:35.431
There's nothing there.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.432
( chuckles )

38:36.523 --> 38:37.387
"Warning...

38:37.483 --> 38:39.223
"don't flush corrosives...

38:39.318 --> 38:41.149
down the waste tunnel."

38:41.236 --> 38:42.316
Mmm.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.110
That's all right.
That's a joke.

38:44.198 --> 38:45.779
Aeryn:
Excellent.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.322
If we're going to let blue
eyes save the day,

38:47.409 --> 38:49.570
we better come up
with a very good plan.

38:51.788 --> 38:53.449
I'm not deficient.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.036
I'm superior!

38:56.126 --> 39:00.039
Humans are superior.

39:01.256 --> 39:02.871
What the hell is this?

39:02.966 --> 39:05.298
Heat-deflecting paste. You'll
burn up in there without it.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.000
Smells like puke.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.632
l pre-digested it to increase
its potency.

39:09.723 --> 39:11.259
It's puke?!

39:11.350 --> 39:14.012
We're going to have to move
fast. All of Moya is glowing.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.479
I hate these goggles.
They look like crap.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.178
Stop whining. You sound
like a zelmad.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.935
They're the only thing that are
going to stop you from going
blind in there.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.233
Probably will, anyway. Here.
This may be of use to you.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.938
I made from a piece of my
Prowler, and it will withstand
a zacian laser pulse.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.192
Thank you.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.070
Solar reflective flare wrap.
Pull it on tight.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.699
Does this strike any of you
superior beings as a little
bit ironic?

39:34.790 --> 39:36.326
Chiana:
What?

39:36.416 --> 39:39.283
That I'm the deficient one and
I'm still saving your butts.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.289
Chiana:
Bend over.

39:44.258 --> 39:47.466
We soaked it in Zhaan's bile
paste for as long as we could.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.760
Great.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.223
I look ridiculous, don't I?

39:52.307 --> 39:53.638
Rygel:
Don't worry.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.307
This is T'raltixx's
disappearing device,

39:56.395 --> 40:00.013
so it won't matter how
ridiculous you look.

40:00.107 --> 40:06.273
(humming "Ride of the
Valkyries" )

40:07.364 --> 40:09.400
We are going to die.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.284
We've attached you to the
module in the Transport Hangar.

40:18.375 --> 40:21.208
Fire the drive up for ten
microts, no more.

40:21.295 --> 40:24.253
No, mippa pippie, I do not
want to blow up.

40:24.339 --> 40:27.081
When you get in there, cutoff
as many of the power conductors
as you can.

40:27.175 --> 40:30.258
That should reduce his strength
so that you can then get close
enough to kill him, alright?

40:30.345 --> 40:31.846
Right. Damn, it's bright
in there.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.841
You ready?

40:33.932 --> 40:35.263
Now, Rygel. Only ten.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.339
Yes.

40:37.853 --> 40:39.059
Is it working?

40:39.146 --> 40:40.761
It's working. Go, John, go.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.981
There's someone in here, Pilot.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.940
| see no one.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.243
Five... six...

40:58.206 --> 40:59.286
No!

40:59.374 --> 41:00.910
What are you doing, Pilot?

41:01.001 --> 41:02.161
Nothing.

41:04.171 --> 41:05.126
My light!

41:05.213 --> 41:08.171
Nine... ten.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.543
Eleven... twelve

41:12.638 --> 41:13.502
Stop!

41:13.597 --> 41:15.303
( powering down )

41:19.394 --> 41:21.726
Crichton! Ahh!

41:22.898 --> 41:23.978
Crap!

41:24.066 --> 41:25.681
You can't stop me, Crichton.

41:25.776 --> 41:27.391
I have the light.

41:27.486 --> 41:31.399
But humans are superior!

41:41.124 --> 41:42.739
You're too weak, Crichton.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.415
I will kill you!

41:46.838 --> 41:49.215
I will get the light and
take over your ship.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.335
And murder you all!

41:51.426 --> 41:53.007
Give me the light!

41:53.095 --> 41:54.551
Thethﬂ

41:54.638 --> 41:57.425
I need more light!

41:57.516 --> 41:58.801
(wailing)

41:58.892 --> 42:01.053
Light 'em up!
-You cannot stop me, Crichton.

42:05.607 --> 42:06.972
Go on, kill me.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.353
Well, there are thousands
just like me.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.277
We will find another Leviathan
to make our light.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.106
And when we do, we'll spread
like a plague!

42:15.200 --> 42:18.784
We'll rise from our dormancy
and kill you all!

42:18.870 --> 42:24.410
I told them it was a mistake
bringing you on board.

42:24.501 --> 42:26.332
( screaming )

42:28.255 --> 42:29.745
(yelling)

42:38.265 --> 42:41.302
Pilot:
I have talked with
everyone else.

42:42.352 --> 42:45.810
All I can say is I'm
terribly sorry.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.730
T'raltixx somehow brought out
the worst in me.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.650
I think he brought out the
worst in all of us, Pilot.

42:51.737 --> 42:52.726
Yes.

42:52.821 --> 42:54.903
Your apology is accepted.

42:54.990 --> 42:56.025
Thank you.

42:56.116 --> 42:57.572
Thank you both.

43:01.163 --> 43:03.495
I, uh...

43:03.582 --> 43:07.291
lam ashamed of what I did.

43:07.377 --> 43:09.208
I thought you were going
to kill me.

43:09.296 --> 43:11.662
I'm sorry, Rygel.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.207
Can you forgive me?

43:15.761 --> 43:17.001
No.

43:20.974 --> 43:23.306
Not yet.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.231
That did it.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.769
Damn, that was heavy.
How'd you move it by yourself?

43:35.864 --> 43:40.198
Hmm? Oh, I don't know,
ljust did.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.828
Chiana:
Some of the things you said...

43:45.916 --> 43:47.326
Yeah, look, I'm sorry, really.

43:47.417 --> 43:50.079
Oh, no, no, look,
don't apologize.

43:50.170 --> 43:52.456
l was impressed.

43:52.547 --> 43:55.334
How did you come up with
all that crap?

43:55.425 --> 43:58.087
I don't know, Pip, it
was just there.

43:58.178 --> 44:02.012
Did I... did I say anything
awful, Chiana?

44:02.098 --> 44:04.180
(laughing)

44:04.267 --> 44:05.723
Chiana:
You don't remember?

44:05.811 --> 44:08.223
Zhaan:
No, T'raltixx triggered
such a...

44:08.313 --> 44:10.975
an intense reaction in me
I blanked everything out.

44:11.066 --> 44:13.899
Whoa, I wish I could do that.

44:13.985 --> 44:18.194
Chiana:
No, no, Zhaan. Look you were
the best out of all of us.

44:18.281 --> 44:21.569
You looked like you were
having a great time.

44:25.288 --> 44:27.870
Listen, uh...

44:27.958 --> 44:29.744
anything I said, I, uh...

44:29.835 --> 44:32.201
I... I know.

44:33.755 --> 44:35.495
Me, too.

44:41.179 --> 44:44.137
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall.

44:44.224 --> 44:48.308
And all the kings horses and
all the kings men...

44:49.813 --> 44:51.428
Hey, Zhaan...

44:52.607 --> 44:55.269
How do we take it all back?

44:56.319 --> 44:58.310
I don't know.

44:59.489 --> 45:01.480
Yeah.
