00:21.054 --> 00:22.646
He's got temporal...
delirium.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.952
Trauma Team 4 to Level Red.

00:25.058 --> 00:27.288
Trauma Team 4
to Level Red.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.628
Reconnect to stations...

00:33.700 --> 00:36.965
Code 4 Nursing Unit,
report to Level Red.

00:37.103 --> 00:39.799
He does have a sensor.
lt's not working.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.509
Negative for dysplasia,
viremia, necrobiosis.

00:44.577 --> 00:46.340
Please extend your arms.

00:46.413 --> 00:49.871
Species: Dralian.
ldentity: Gar.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.440
T.C. 15. You may proceed.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.521
Chellick.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.352
Lucky l caught you.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.791
Mr. Gar, l wish
l had time to talk.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.589
Well, all you have
to do is listen.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.721
l have a new supply
of cytogenics.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.732
Your last supply was useless.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.734
Expired lots, diluted samples.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.065
Oh, l have something
special this time.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.605
The latest in substandard
technology, no doubt.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.141
Oh, this item
is far from substandard.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.871
And as a gesture of goodwill,
l'm offering it to you first.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.346
We don't need
another neural monitor.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.883
Mm, this is much more
sophisticated than that.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.612
l'm sure it has
some ingenious use,

01:26.686 --> 01:28.119
but l'm not interested.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.784
Please state the nature...

01:33.860 --> 01:36.454
of the medical emergency?

03:26.339 --> 03:27.328
Where have you taken me?

03:27.440 --> 03:30.307
lt's a holographic construct,
programmed with over

03:30.376 --> 03:31.707
five million medical protocols.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.712
l demand to be returned
to Voyager at once.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.475
What's Voyager?.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.948
The Federation starship
to which l'm assigned.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.484
This man is a kidnapper.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.918
l would never offer you
stolen property.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.582
l traded warp-grade dilithium
for this program.

03:44.657 --> 03:45.783
What's your price?

03:45.858 --> 03:47.257
This negotiation is pointless.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.919
l'm not about to perform
medical services

03:48.995 --> 03:50.428
for a pair of common thieves.

03:50.496 --> 03:52.930
lt doesn't seem
to be in working order.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.958
Trauma victims are now arriving
at Emergency lntake 7.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.866
What caused their injuries?

03:59.973 --> 04:02.464
A generator explosion
at the Gammadan Mining Facility.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.339
You better start cooperating,
or l will dismantle your program

04:05.411 --> 04:07.242
and sell it off
one subroutine at a time.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.611
When Captain Janeway
discovers what you've done...

04:09.682 --> 04:10.774
Come on.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.839
Let's go, clear a path.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.476
We're gonna lose this guy.
Come on.

04:13.553 --> 04:14.417
Here we go.

04:14.487 --> 04:15.317
All right, tuck him in there.

04:15.388 --> 04:16.878
l can't find any coagulant.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.548
Somebody check the reserves.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.853
There are no reserves.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.757
Oh, this one's got
grade-4 pulmonary burns.

04:21.827 --> 04:25.730
Patient's T.C. is 4.
Transfer to Level Green.

04:25.798 --> 04:27.789
Level Green isn't
equipped for this.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.097
His T.C.'s only 4.
Take him to Green.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.831
Don't touch that.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.271
This patient's bleeding
seriously.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.603
He needs an immediate infusion.

04:36.676 --> 04:37.938
What are you doing?

04:38.011 --> 04:39.273
Get away from him.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.835
With technology this primitive,

04:40.913 --> 04:42.574
you may as well be using
leeches.

04:42.649 --> 04:43.946
Who is this man?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.277
A doctor, of sorts.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.443
l thought you were

04:46.519 --> 04:47.611
withholding your services.

04:47.687 --> 04:48.949
Fortunately for these patients,

04:49.022 --> 04:50.683
l am programmed
with the Hippocratic oath.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.384
lt requires me
to treat anyone who's ill.

04:53.559 --> 04:54.958
This patient needs
20 milligrams anesthezine.

04:55.094 --> 04:55.958
Get me a hypospray.

04:56.095 --> 04:57.562
A what?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.791
l'm sorry,
this may hurt a little.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.408
Did you have to program
that Nausicaan guard

05:19.485 --> 05:20.850
to high stick so much?

05:20.920 --> 05:22.046
Well, you play hockey,

05:22.121 --> 05:23.850
you've got
to expect a few lumps.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.857
What are we gonna
tell the Doctor?

05:25.925 --> 05:27.392
Hmm.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.758
You know how he feels
about our juvenile holoprograms.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.457
Relax.
l'll come up with something.

05:32.532 --> 05:34.193
Hey, Doc.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.667
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.768
l know what you're thinking,

05:39.839 --> 05:42.069
but there's
a simple explanation.

05:42.141 --> 05:43.574
Tell him, Tom.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.634
Right. Well, um, see, Doc,

05:45.712 --> 05:48.510
we were running
these invasion scenarios

05:48.581 --> 05:51.744
when this species
of proto-humanoid...

05:51.818 --> 05:54.082
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.678
Are you okay, Doc?

05:56.756 --> 05:59.987
Please take an analgesic
and return in 24 hours.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.995
lt's a replicated fake.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.826
The program running in Sick Bay

06:05.932 --> 06:08.298
is from one of Doc's
old training files.

06:08.401 --> 06:12.269
l want someone to tell me
how this snake oil salesman

06:12.338 --> 06:16.274
managed to evade every
security protocol on the ship.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.674
l take full responsibility.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.076
l'm not interested in fault.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.841
l just want to know
how it happened.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.610
Um, Gar spent the
night in Sick Bay.

06:24.684 --> 06:28.415
He claimed to have gotten
food poisoning at dinner.

06:28.488 --> 06:29.887
He had plenty of time
to learn about

06:29.989 --> 06:31.388
the mobile emitter
from the Doctor.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.220
Who l'm sure was more
than willing to extol

06:33.292 --> 06:34.384
its virtues.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.427
Medical logs show

06:35.495 --> 06:37.258
the training file
was activated just before

06:37.330 --> 06:39.264
Gar left Voyager.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.324
Scan for his ion trail,
and let's review safeguards

06:42.402 --> 06:45.735
for accessing low-security
files, shall we, Mr. Tuvok?

06:47.807 --> 06:50.071
Captain, don't blame
Tuvok for what happened.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.405
lt was my fault.

06:51.477 --> 06:52.910
How so?

06:52.979 --> 06:56.847
Gar kept complaining
how bland his dinner was,

06:56.916 --> 06:59.851
so l added a few exotic spices.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.443
l'm not sure l see your point.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.250
l-l was trying so hard to
create something he liked

07:04.290 --> 07:07.191
that l didn't take his alien
physiology into account.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.455
Everyone's assuming
he faked his illness,

07:09.529 --> 07:11.622
but l might have
really made him sick.

07:11.697 --> 07:15.292
lt's not as if your cooking
turned him into a thief.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.494
No, but if he hadn't
gone to Sick Bay,

07:17.603 --> 07:19.662
he may never have
come up with a plan

07:19.772 --> 07:20.966
to kidnap the Doctor,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.338
much less have
the opportunity to do it.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.774
ln my experience, Neelix,

07:24.844 --> 07:27.608
men like Gar have no trouble
finding opportunities

07:27.680 --> 07:29.511
to take advantage
of other people.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.016
Well, l just hope there's
something l can do

07:32.084 --> 07:33.676
to help find the Doctor.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.153
Well, when and if
that opportunity arises,

07:36.222 --> 07:38.383
l'm sure you'll make
the most of it.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.699
That was the most impressive
cortical bypass l've ever seen.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.865
lt's just a question
of possessing the basic skills.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.374
Ah, if l had
basic skills like yours,

07:57.443 --> 07:58.876
they'd move me up to Level Blue.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.105
Take this patient to Yellow.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.874
You seem a little low
on resources here.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.438
lf l could contact
my medical staff,

08:03.516 --> 08:05.780
l might be able to get you
some additional supplies.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.285
Uh, communication is
usually restricted,

08:07.353 --> 08:09.184
but the Allocator
might give you clearance.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.018
Good. Where can l find him?

08:11.090 --> 08:12.819
Uh, the Allocator isn't a him.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.358
lt's our main computer.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.258
Well...

08:16.329 --> 08:18.388
Perhaps it could establish
a communications link

08:18.464 --> 08:19.624
with Voyager's main computer.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.198
You'll have to submit
a formal request to Chellick

08:23.302 --> 08:25.293
and support it
with Form 83-W in triplicate.

08:25.404 --> 08:26.462
Even then...

08:27.740 --> 08:30.675
Why hasn't this patient
been treated yet?

08:30.743 --> 08:32.472
He's waiting for proton imaging.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.979
There are a lot of other people
ahead of him.

08:35.047 --> 08:38.015
lt's nice to see someone
knows what's going on.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.517
What's your name?

08:39.585 --> 08:41.018
Tebbis.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.884
Well, Tebbis,
this doesn't look too serious.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.856
Uh, it's just a little
osteal extravasation.

08:45.925 --> 08:48.189
Excellent diagnosis.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.161
l hope to be a doctor someday.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.288
Really? Well, l hope
your working conditions

08:52.365 --> 08:53.730
are better than these.

08:53.799 --> 08:54.731
lt wouldn't be so bad

08:54.800 --> 08:56.199
if they'd let us listen
to music.

08:56.302 --> 08:57.894
lt would certainly
improve my mood.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.232
lt's not just that,

08:59.338 --> 09:01.499
but music has
great healing power.

09:01.574 --> 09:03.769
l couldn't agree
with you more.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.109
Uh, exhale slowly.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.273
Can't you give him
a neural blocker?

09:10.349 --> 09:12.214
He's already had his allocation.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.089
The leg injury isn't all
l'm picking up.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.126
He's got some kind
of systemic disease.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.354
lt's a chromo-viral infection.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.795
We have 12 cases down here.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.457
He's in the final stage.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.501
ls there an
established treatment?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.537
Cytoglobin injections.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.736
These scans don't show
any cytoglobin

09:34.807 --> 09:35.831
in his bloodstream.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.532
He hasn't been given any.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.701
Why not?

09:38.778 --> 09:40.609
He doesn't have
a high enough T.C.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.772
''T.C.''? What's that?

09:41.847 --> 09:43.144
Ah, there you are.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.409
l'm happy to report

09:44.483 --> 09:46.576
that l've acquired your program
from Gar.

09:46.652 --> 09:47.880
Please come with me.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.249
l will not.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.414
May l remind you

09:50.489 --> 09:51.888
l'm being illegally detained?

09:51.958 --> 09:54.586
Or hasn't the rule of law
reached this society yet?

09:54.660 --> 09:57.993
We follow the Allocator's rules,
and it's determined

09:58.064 --> 10:00.999
that your services are
required on Level Blue.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.661
Eh, please, Doctor,
the Allocator knows

10:03.769 --> 10:06.294
which patients
need help the most.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.577
Level Blue is your critical care
area, l presume.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.915
Level Blue is the area
where it's most critical

10:20.987 --> 10:23.353
that we provide excellent care.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.693
These patients will be
your chief responsibility

10:38.804 --> 10:40.237
from now on.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.740
Do whatever you can
to make them well.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.010
Why are these patients
getting preferential treatment?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.245
They have a higher T.C.
than the others.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.188
lndulge me.
What's T.C.?

10:58.257 --> 10:59.485
Treatment Coefficient.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.617
The Allocator assigns one
to every patient.

11:01.727 --> 11:04.355
lt determines the level
of care they receive.

11:04.397 --> 11:08.094
How is this
coefficient derived?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.600
Through a complex formula

11:09.702 --> 11:12.193
that involves profession,
skills, accomplishments...

11:12.304 --> 11:15.239
How is any of that relevant
to medical treatment?

11:15.307 --> 11:16.740
An agricultural engineer

11:16.809 --> 11:19.403
is obviously more important
than a waste processor.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.070
lmportant to whom?

11:21.147 --> 11:22.375
Society.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.882
When your resources are limited,

11:24.950 --> 11:26.383
you have to prioritize.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.749
So you base treatment

11:27.820 --> 11:30.948
on whether patients have
particular abilities?

11:31.023 --> 11:33.355
lt's much more
complicated than that.

11:33.426 --> 11:37.487
The Allocator assesses
the entire individual.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.929
And reduces his life
to a number.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.489
lt may seem impersonal,
but it's what

11:41.567 --> 11:43.159
the Dinaali
have contracted us to do.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.260
Chellick's people are known
throughout the sector

11:45.371 --> 11:46.963
for their
administrative skills.

11:47.106 --> 11:50.098
Before they came here,
we were a dying race.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.109
Eco-disasters, famine...

11:52.178 --> 11:53.941
Dr. Dysek, Chief of Medicine.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.811
The medical hologram
l told you about.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.577
Are you in charge
of what passes for care

11:58.651 --> 12:00.016
on Level Red?

12:00.052 --> 12:02.452
Because those people
are suffering.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.614
lntriguing technology.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.386
Can we use him
to treat patients yet?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.893
That's what he's here for.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.327
ln some societies,
it's considered rude

12:11.397 --> 12:13.024
to refer to someone
in the third person

12:13.099 --> 12:15.465
while he's standing
in front of you.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.502
l'm sure
you'll make good use of him.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.811
The warp trail ends here.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.314
Gar should be directly ahead.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.406
All stop.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.418
Red Alert.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.477
On screen.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.856
lt's emitting
a false warp signature.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.622
Looks like we've underestimated
Mr. Gar again.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.958
Now what?

12:45.030 --> 12:46.691
There may be another way
to find him.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.961
What do you have in mind?

12:49.101 --> 12:50.693
He traded us high-grade iridium,

12:50.803 --> 12:52.862
which has
a very brief half-life.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.837
His ship is slow.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.205
Logic suggests
he acquired the substance

12:57.276 --> 12:59.005
within a radius
of three light-years.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.773
Cross-reference our sensor logs
and long-range scans.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.344
Two planets,
no atmosphere or technology

13:07.419 --> 13:09.512
a T-class nebula...

13:09.588 --> 13:10.714
Here's something.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.850
An asteroid with approximately
200 humanoid life signs,

13:13.926 --> 13:16.156
subterranean structures.

13:16.228 --> 13:17.855
Sounds like a mining operation.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.727
lf that's where Mr. Gar acquired

13:19.799 --> 13:22.393
the iridium, they may be able
to help us find him.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.470
Tom, how fast
can you get us there?

13:25.571 --> 13:26.868
Less than two hours.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.270
Do it.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.037
We're being hailed.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.376
Open a channel.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.445
l want my iridium back now.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.077
l beg your pardon?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.382
l've scanned your ship.

13:43.455 --> 13:44.854
l know you've got it on board.

13:44.924 --> 13:48.291
Yes, we obtained it from a man
called Gar, a merchant...

13:48.360 --> 13:49.418
You mean thief.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.726
So, you have
had the pleasure of meeting him.

13:52.798 --> 13:53.890
He was here two days ago.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.230
He sold us
3,000 induction units.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.927
He was gone a day
before we realized

13:58.037 --> 14:00.335
he'd also stolen 20 kilos
of ore.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.705
We had a similar experience.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.744
Maybe we can help each other.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.540
How?

14:07.613 --> 14:10.241
Do you have any idea
where we might find him?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.682
Will you return my iridium?

14:12.751 --> 14:14.013
By all means,

14:14.086 --> 14:16.748
but Gar only traded us half
of what he stole from you.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.882
However, we might be able
to get the rest of it back.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.621
All l can tell you is
that the induction units

14:22.695 --> 14:24.925
came from a planetoid
called Velos.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.499
You may go.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.629
Your surgical technique
is impressive.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.206
Well, you've obviously
had experience

14:35.274 --> 14:36.605
with cellular repair.

14:36.675 --> 14:37.642
As a matter of fact,

14:37.710 --> 14:39.575
l've done extensive
research on the subject.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.545
l'd be happy
to share it with you,

14:41.614 --> 14:44.105
but we'll have to contact
Voyager to get it.

14:44.183 --> 14:46.151
You'll have to discuss that
with Chellick.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.186
He authorizes
all communications.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.948
lt's time for this patient's
next injection.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.184
Requesting one
cytoglobin injection

14:54.260 --> 14:57.093
for patient B-3,
priority Blue-7 gamma.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.926
One cytoglobin injection
authorized.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.829
Does this patient have
a chromo-viral infection?

15:06.939 --> 15:08.099
No. Why?

15:08.207 --> 15:09.504
l was told

15:09.575 --> 15:12.009
cytoglobin is the standard
treatment for that disease.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.774
Cytoglobin also prevents
arterial aging.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.681
Will that be all?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.742
You may go.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.787
This patient's arteries
appear to be healthy.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.551
At the moment,
but daily injections

15:25.624 --> 15:28.388
increase life expectancy
up to 40 percent.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.724
We prescribe them
for all Level Blue patients.

15:30.796 --> 15:34.095
l just saw a boy
on Level Red who's dying.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.327
This medicine
could save his life.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.063
This woman is a Chief Engineer
of an irrigation facility

15:39.171 --> 15:41.571
which provides water
to half the subcontinent.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.471
So her life is more valuable?

15:43.542 --> 15:46.272
Keeping her healthy
contributes to our survival.

15:46.345 --> 15:48.540
Can you say the same
for the boy on Level Red?

15:48.614 --> 15:50.844
Who knows what he'll accomplish
if he has the chance.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.851
lf he becomes more valuable
to society, his T.C. will rise,

15:53.919 --> 15:55.944
and then he'll receive
better treatment.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.680
He may not be around
long enough.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.121
l'm sorry he's sick,

15:59.191 --> 16:01.056
but our society
is much better off

16:01.160 --> 16:05.187
since we began following
the Allocator's protocols.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.930
Some of you are.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.806
l never expected
to see you again.

16:17.876 --> 16:18.808
Why do you say that?

16:18.877 --> 16:20.811
Level Blue is much
more prestigious.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.313
Prestige is the least
of my concerns.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.815
How is he?

16:24.883 --> 16:26.145
Not well.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.891
His condition's
deteriorated so rapidly.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.689
His coenzyme allotment's
been reduced.

16:36.762 --> 16:38.696
Are we here to help
these people or kill them?

16:38.764 --> 16:41.562
His T.C. is just too low.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.895
Maybe we can raise it.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.330
That's not possible.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.131
lf it's purely
a function of statistics,

16:46.238 --> 16:48.035
we can simply input more data.

16:48.107 --> 16:49.404
We're not
authorized to do th...

16:49.475 --> 16:50.601
Voje.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.644
When you look
at your patient lying there,

16:52.711 --> 16:55.441
you have to ask yourself:
What can l do?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.243
What must l do?

16:57.316 --> 17:00.376
We can amend his database
to include

17:00.452 --> 17:01.646
additional skills.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.709
Such as?

17:02.788 --> 17:05.518
His extensive knowledge
of neutronics.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.387
He doesn't know anything
about neutronics.

17:07.459 --> 17:09.154
We can say he does.

17:09.228 --> 17:10.991
What's the harm in trying?

17:15.467 --> 17:17.594
Amend patient R-12's T.C.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.830
to include an expertise
in neutronics.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.804
Unable to verify.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.273
Amendment denied.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.038
You see?

17:26.111 --> 17:27.510
Hello.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.671
Lie still.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.806
What are you doing?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.317
Trying to get you
the proper medication.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.582
You're wasting time

17:36.655 --> 17:38.885
you could be spending
with other patients.

17:39.024 --> 17:41.356
You have as much right
to treatment as anyone.

17:41.427 --> 17:44.794
lt's not your fault.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.925
There's nothing you can do.

18:00.379 --> 18:01.437
Nurse.

18:01.513 --> 18:02.480
Yes, Doctor?

18:02.548 --> 18:04.015
Why hasn't this patient received

18:04.083 --> 18:05.983
her additional
cytoglobin injection?

18:06.051 --> 18:07.109
Additional?

18:07.186 --> 18:08.312
lf you'd examine her chart,

18:08.387 --> 18:10.048
you'd see that l've
increased her dosage.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.817
Dr. Dysek didn't say anything...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.482
Dr. Dysek is at home
with his family.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.527
Would you like me to contact him
so you can explain

18:15.594 --> 18:16.754
why you're not doing your job?

18:16.829 --> 18:19.957
No, Doctor.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.796
Requesting
one cytoglobin injection

18:22.901 --> 18:26.837
for patient B-3,
priority Blue-7 gamma.

18:26.905 --> 18:29.635
One cytoglobin injection
authorized.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.139
l'll do it myself.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.807
Can l assist you?

18:39.885 --> 18:41.375
You may go.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.800
He convinced me to let him
take the induction units

19:37.910 --> 19:38.877
on consignment.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.876
That was more than ten days ago.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.743
l haven't heard from him since.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.874
You appear to be an experienced
merchant, Mr. Kipp.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.179
Why would you trust
someone like Gar?

19:48.253 --> 19:50.380
He came highly recommended.

19:50.455 --> 19:51.513
By whom?

19:51.590 --> 19:52.682
A buyer l know.

19:52.758 --> 19:53.986
He said he's been trading

19:54.059 --> 19:55.754
with Gar for years.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.557
Do you know where we
can find this buyer?

19:58.630 --> 20:00.097
Yes, Captain.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.827
l am the fool who said
that Gar could be trusted.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.403
Sounds like you've
changed your mind.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.769
l should have known
it was a mistake, but...

20:08.840 --> 20:13.539
Well... you see, l have never
been able to say no to my wife.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.512
What does she have
to do with it?

20:15.581 --> 20:18.641
Well, she's the one who asked me
to recommend Gar.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.412
Then she must know him well.

20:20.485 --> 20:24.080
They're... friends.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.181
May we speak with her?

20:26.258 --> 20:28.453
She's, uh...

20:28.527 --> 20:30.461
Well, she's not here.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.123
Do you know
where we might find her?

20:33.198 --> 20:36.463
She left me.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.263
You're a woman.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.930
You saw my husband
with your own eyes--

20:42.040 --> 20:43.598
overweight, depressed.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.506
You would have left him, too,

20:45.577 --> 20:49.479
especially if you had met
someone as exciting as Gar.

20:49.548 --> 20:51.516
Yes, he's very exciting.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.381
That's why you're looking
for him, isn't it?

20:54.453 --> 20:56.114
You want him for yourself.

20:56.188 --> 20:59.487
l assure you, l have no romantic
interest in him whatsoever.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.924
Why? Not good enough for you?

21:02.027 --> 21:03.119
No, it's not that.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.129
lt's just that...

21:07.165 --> 21:10.066
l already have a man.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.665
We have a business opportunity
for Mr. Gar--

21:15.774 --> 21:19.141
one that will expire
if we don't find him soon.

21:19.211 --> 21:22.612
He's on his way
to the gambling tournament

21:22.681 --> 21:23.773
on Selek lV.

21:23.849 --> 21:27.444
When you see him,
tell him to hurry home.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.740
How are you feeling?

21:50.108 --> 21:51.575
Better.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.735
That's what happens

21:52.811 --> 21:54.438
when you get
the proper treatment.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.676
But l'm not authorized
to receive cytoglobin.

22:00.752 --> 22:01.844
You are now.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.785
You'll need
several more injections,

22:03.855 --> 22:05.880
but you can expect
a complete recovery.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.618
Whatever you did,
they'll find out.

22:08.694 --> 22:09.888
They'll punish you.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.189
You're assuming
l've done something illicit.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.196
Didn't you?

22:13.265 --> 22:14.357
Of course not.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.060
l simply had a talk
with Chellick,

22:16.168 --> 22:18.602
explained to him
what a bright young man you are,

22:18.670 --> 22:21.036
and he had the Allocator
recalculate your T.C.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.939
l've never met
a doctor like you.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.703
Well... it's not hard
to stand out

22:25.777 --> 22:28.109
when the general level
of competence is so low.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.545
There are patients

22:29.614 --> 22:32.447
on this level who deserve
a higher T.C. than l do.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.712
Could you talk to Chellick
about them?

22:43.128 --> 22:44.686
Thank you.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.431
Ah, Voje.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.595
You're not busy, are you?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.263
Well, actually, l was just...

22:55.374 --> 22:57.433
Good. l want you to help me
dispense these injections.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.804
Where did you get
the cytoglobin?

22:58.877 --> 22:59.809
Level Blue. Where else?

22:59.878 --> 23:00.936
You stole it?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.911
l'd prefer to think of it
as ''reallocation.''

23:02.981 --> 23:04.107
We're going to treat every

23:04.182 --> 23:05.672
chromo-virus patient
on this level.

23:05.751 --> 23:06.718
Do you have any idea

23:06.785 --> 23:08.719
what kind of trouble
we could get into?

23:08.787 --> 23:10.516
''We?'' Then you will help me.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.352
Uh, no! Absolutely not!

23:12.424 --> 23:15.154
Modifying data files
was bad enough.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.525
Well, l certainly wouldn't
want you to do anything

23:17.596 --> 23:18.824
to compromise your ethics.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.524
l'll help you.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.433
You should be in bed.

23:23.535 --> 23:24.900
Actually, now that
he's improving,

23:25.070 --> 23:26.594
a little activity
will do him good.

23:26.705 --> 23:30.505
You can go back to doing...
whatever you were doing.

23:37.048 --> 23:40.142
The best place
to inject him is here

23:40.218 --> 23:42.846
in the lateral artery.

23:46.558 --> 23:47.820
Excellent work.

23:47.893 --> 23:50.225
lt's nice to see
someone in this hospital

23:50.295 --> 23:51.762
has a future as a healer.

23:53.031 --> 23:54.965
lf we each take a third
of the patients,

23:55.100 --> 23:57.466
maybe we can finish
before someone catches us.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.166
Who do you think you are,

24:05.277 --> 24:08.713
prescribing unnecessary
medications for my patients?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.247
lt wasn't unnecessary.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.840
lf you believe that,
you're incompetent,

24:12.918 --> 24:14.579
or perhaps malfunctioning.

24:14.653 --> 24:19.420
l was simply trying to increase
our allocation of resources.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.755
What are you talking about?

24:21.827 --> 24:23.089
l did some checking.

24:23.161 --> 24:26.426
Last month, Level Blue's
total medication requests

24:26.498 --> 24:27.760
were down by 6 percent.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.425
Because our cure rate
was higher.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.796
Exactly.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.234
Because you performed
so efficiently last month,

24:33.305 --> 24:36.172
the Allocator will determine
you're able to do with less

24:36.241 --> 24:37.799
next month.

24:37.909 --> 24:40.139
lf we don't order
more medication now,

24:40.212 --> 24:43.670
we may not get it...
when we need it.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.238
Think about it, Doctor.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.808
lf you don't have
the proper resources,

24:47.886 --> 24:50.354
your cure rate could go down.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.787
lf that happens...

24:51.857 --> 24:54.348
the Allocator may assign you
to a lower level.

24:54.426 --> 24:55.518
Mm-hmm.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.528
Are we having a problem

24:57.596 --> 24:59.826
with our newest piece
of technology?

24:59.898 --> 25:01.798
Actually...

25:03.101 --> 25:05.365
...he seems to be
learning the system...

25:05.470 --> 25:07.495
quite well.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.180
Oh. Three of the patients
we injected

25:18.250 --> 25:19.410
are practically virus-free.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.248
What did you expect?

25:22.320 --> 25:26.222
Um, maybe we could ''reallocate''
other medications,

25:26.291 --> 25:27.553
treat more patients.

25:27.626 --> 25:28.752
Now you're thinking
like a doctor.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.089
And to support your efforts,

25:30.161 --> 25:32.391
l've arranged
for resources from Level Blue

25:32.464 --> 25:34.898
to be diverted here
on a regular basis.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.228
How did you manage that?

25:36.334 --> 25:37.392
Let's just say,

25:37.502 --> 25:40.596
Dr. Dysek and l have developed
a professional rapport.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.673
Sometimes l even
surprise myself.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.103
We may actually
make these people better.

25:47.178 --> 25:50.306
That feeling you get
from healing someone...

25:50.382 --> 25:52.282
infectious, isn't it?

25:56.021 --> 25:57.613
Where did you get that?

25:57.689 --> 25:59.884
One of the technicians
was going to recycle it

25:59.958 --> 26:02.358
because it wasn't working,
but l think l fixed it.

26:04.763 --> 26:08.028
Seems to be in good condition.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.191
And so do you.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.996
You'll be well enough
to leave soon.

26:11.102 --> 26:14.469
Couldn't you say l'm still sick?

26:14.539 --> 26:16.200
Don't you want to go home?

26:16.274 --> 26:17.605
lf l do,

26:17.676 --> 26:20.008
they'll send me to work
in the refinery with my father.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.546
What about school?
Your medical training?

26:22.614 --> 26:25.378
l would never be authorized
for that.

26:25.450 --> 26:27.042
He's right.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.484
lf l stay here,
you can teach me,

26:29.554 --> 26:31.818
and l can help you
treat your patients.

26:34.092 --> 26:37.061
l'm not planning
on being here that long myself.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.129
Then l can help Dr. Voje.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.628
We'll see what we can do.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.941
l have picked up Gar's ship,
directly ahead.

26:55.046 --> 26:56.809
Again?

26:56.881 --> 26:58.348
l'm reading his bio-signs.

26:58.416 --> 27:00.884
Any sign of the Doctor
or his emitter?

27:01.019 --> 27:02.043
Not yet.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.712
Should l hail Gar?

27:03.788 --> 27:06.279
lf we let him know we're here,
he may try to slip away.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.121
We could drop out of warp
at close range

27:08.193 --> 27:10.286
and grab him before he knows
what's happening.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.624
l like it.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.459
Tom...

27:13.531 --> 27:16.091
Tuvok.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.764
He's hailing.

27:22.874 --> 27:25.001
l guess we put him
in the mood to talk.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.306
On screen.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.040
l thought we were friends,
Captain.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.672
Why am l being treated this way?

27:30.749 --> 27:32.376
l think l deserve better.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.042
Where's our Doctor?

27:34.119 --> 27:35.279
l have no idea.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.753
l certainly hope
nothing's happened to him.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.119
Scans are complete.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.384
Neither the mobile emitter

27:40.458 --> 27:42.085
nor the Doctor's program
are aboard

27:42.160 --> 27:43.627
Gar's ship.

27:43.695 --> 27:46.323
Well, of course they're not.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.462
He's trying
to destabilize the tractor beam

27:51.569 --> 27:52.661
with a feedback pulse.

27:52.771 --> 27:54.739
Compensating.

27:54.806 --> 27:57.104
Don't bother, Harry.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.944
Just beam him to the brig.

28:11.256 --> 28:15.693
Tebbis... wake up.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.887
Time to make our rounds.

28:20.598 --> 28:22.828
Locate patient R-12.

28:22.967 --> 28:26.767
Patient R-12 has been
transferred to Level White.

28:28.306 --> 28:29.568
Tebbis has been moved.

28:29.641 --> 28:30.699
l know.

28:30.809 --> 28:31.833
What's Level White?

28:31.976 --> 28:33.705
Some kind of patient
recovery area?

28:33.778 --> 28:35.973
lt's the morgue.

28:48.059 --> 28:50.425
l demand an explanation
for the death of that boy.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.455
l'm responsible
for thousands of patients.

28:54.532 --> 28:56.124
You'll have to be more specific.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.327
His name was Tebbis.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.330
Patient R-12.

29:03.842 --> 29:06.936
Acute chromo-viral disease.

29:07.011 --> 29:08.774
He was recovering.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.610
Apparently,
he developed complications.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.309
What kind of complications?

29:12.383 --> 29:13.907
A secondary infection.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.247
lt spread rapidly.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.685
How was it treated?

29:16.755 --> 29:17.779
lt wasn't.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.757
The patient had exceeded
his medication allotment.

29:20.825 --> 29:23.760
lt seems someone had given him
unauthorized injections.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.255
Did you think
l wouldn't find out?

29:33.705 --> 29:36.765
Don't you have
any ethical standards?

29:36.875 --> 29:39.708
You are hardly in a position
to speak to me of ethics.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.143
Lying, stealing...

29:41.212 --> 29:43.237
Any other crimes
you wish to confess?

29:43.314 --> 29:45.373
l was trying to save lives.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.350
And l am trying
to save a society.

29:47.418 --> 29:51.047
Do you really think patient R-12
is going to help me do that?!

29:51.122 --> 29:53.181
His name was Tebbis.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.418
He wasn't contributing.

29:54.492 --> 29:55.982
He was a drain on resources.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.721
You're not just rationing
health care here.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.491
You're getting rid of the sick
and the weak.

29:59.564 --> 30:02.055
lf the boy had been fit,
he would have survived.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.964
Why don't you just put a phaser
to their heads?

30:05.436 --> 30:07.028
We're healers, not killers.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.801
l'm going to expose you.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.105
To whom--
the people who employ me?

30:13.178 --> 30:16.306
They brought me here
to make the hard choices

30:16.381 --> 30:17.746
they don't want to make.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.580
From now on, l'm restricting you
to Level Blue.

30:20.652 --> 30:23.621
You've done enough damage
on Red.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.849
You mean those patients
that l treated?

30:25.924 --> 30:27.858
Yes, that was inconsiderate
of me.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.757
lt was. You managed
to exceed their annual

30:29.828 --> 30:31.625
medication allotment
in a matter of days.

30:31.696 --> 30:32.788
They're being sent home.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.957
They'll die.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.261
You should have considered

30:36.367 --> 30:37.925
the consequences
of your actions.

30:38.036 --> 30:42.166
Please, don't make them suffer
for my mistakes.

30:42.273 --> 30:44.241
lt won't happen again.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.809
l'm making certain of that.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.708
From now on, your time
will be strictly regulated.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.111
Meaning what?

30:50.181 --> 30:52.911
l've interfaced your holo-matrix
with the Allocator.

30:52.984 --> 30:56.010
Starting now, it will determine
where you go, when you go,

30:56.120 --> 30:57.985
and what you do
when you get there.

30:58.056 --> 30:59.887
The Medical Hologram

30:59.958 --> 31:02.085
will now commence treatment
on Level Blue.

31:04.829 --> 31:08.663
You have six minutes
to treat patient B-3.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.537
l don't know where he is.

31:17.609 --> 31:21.204
Not now, perhaps, but you know
where you took him.

31:21.279 --> 31:24.737
The last time l saw him,
he was in your Sick Bay.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.875
lf you refuse to cooperate,

31:26.951 --> 31:30.751
your knowledge of his location
can be extracted.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.585
How?

31:32.657 --> 31:34.682
A mind-meld.

31:34.759 --> 31:37.523
W-what's that?

31:37.595 --> 31:39.586
An invasive
and disturbing procedure.

31:40.665 --> 31:41.654
Dinnertime!

31:41.733 --> 31:42.961
Mr. Neelix,

31:43.101 --> 31:45.831
l am in the middle
of an interrogation.

31:45.937 --> 31:48.599
Commander, you know
better than anyone

31:48.706 --> 31:51.231
that Starfleet
has strict guidelines

31:51.342 --> 31:53.606
about allowing prisoners to eat.

31:53.678 --> 31:54.770
Very well.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.040
l'll wait.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.248
There we are.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.013
l'm glad to see you
enjoying a meal.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.752
When you got sick last time,
l thought my food

32:08.826 --> 32:10.726
was to blame, until l realized

32:10.795 --> 32:15.755
it was just a ruse for you
to get close to the Doctor.

32:15.833 --> 32:19.234
l used Talaxian wormroot
as the base.

32:19.304 --> 32:20.862
Mm-hmm.

32:20.972 --> 32:22.030
l'm glad you like it.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.471
Some people react badly.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.736
React how?

32:27.812 --> 32:30.076
Oh, dear, l hope
you're not getting sick.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.581
Mm.

32:31.649 --> 32:34.812
lf it's the wormroot,
it's gonna get a lot worse.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.116
What have you done to me?

32:37.188 --> 32:39.952
The usual symptoms
are abdominal spasms,

32:40.091 --> 32:42.059
which increase in severity

32:42.126 --> 32:44.560
for 30 hours...

32:44.629 --> 32:46.290
40 at the most.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.490
Tuvok to Sick Bay.

32:47.565 --> 32:48.759
Don't worry, Mr. Tuvok,

32:48.833 --> 32:50.095
it's not fatal.

32:50.201 --> 32:52.294
lt's horribly unpleasant,
but, uh...

32:52.403 --> 32:53.597
there's an antidote.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.366
Then give it to me!

32:55.473 --> 32:57.407
Unfortunately,

32:57.475 --> 33:01.434
our Doctor is the only one
authorized to administer it.

33:01.512 --> 33:04.379
Maybe if you remembered
where he was...

33:06.684 --> 33:08.549
Mr. Neelix...

33:08.619 --> 33:11.019
have you deliberately
poisoned this man?

33:11.089 --> 33:13.114
Relax.
He's just having gas pains.

33:13.191 --> 33:16.092
Your actions are not only
against regulations...

33:16.160 --> 33:18.754
Didn't l hear someone
threaten a mind-meld?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.195
l was merely trying

33:20.264 --> 33:23.199
to encourage the suspect
to be more forthcoming.

33:23.301 --> 33:24.359
Yeah.

33:24.469 --> 33:28.530
l think he's getting
all the encouragement he needs.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.404
Excuse me, Doctor.

33:33.478 --> 33:34.502
What is it?

33:34.579 --> 33:36.547
l need to prepare this patient
for discharge.

33:36.614 --> 33:37.911
l'm not finished with him yet.

33:37.982 --> 33:39.210
But Chellick's orders are to...

33:39.283 --> 33:41.649
Are to discharge the patient
at the end of the shift.

33:41.719 --> 33:42.845
The shift isn't over, is it?

33:42.920 --> 33:45.150
No, sir, but l need time
in order to get the patient...

33:45.223 --> 33:46.451
l'll tell you when he's ready.

33:46.524 --> 33:51.188
Dr. Voje, report to Level Blue
to assist Dr. Dysek in surgery.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.010
Voje!

34:09.447 --> 34:11.710
l didn't realize
that any of this even existed.

34:11.783 --> 34:12.841
l need to talk to you.

34:12.917 --> 34:13.849
l don't have time.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.748
l just got a message
from the Allocator

34:15.820 --> 34:16.752
that Dysek needs me.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.152
l'm the one who sent for you.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.382
l used his access codes.

34:19.456 --> 34:20.481
Oh.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.219
l need you to smuggle
my mobile emitter

34:22.293 --> 34:23.225
off Level Blue.

34:23.293 --> 34:27.321
Time has expired
for treatment of patient B-1.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.422
Proceed to patient B-3.

34:32.503 --> 34:35.438
The Medical Hologram
has one minute

34:35.505 --> 34:36.905
to treat patient B-3.

34:36.974 --> 34:37.940
You have to help me.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.203
12 patients on Level Red

34:39.277 --> 34:41.074
are being sent home
because of you.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.476
That's why we have to hurry.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.242
We may still be able
to save them.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.146
You've already
endangered my patients,

34:46.217 --> 34:48.514
and now you're asking me
to risk my career?

34:48.585 --> 34:49.917
Why should l help you?

34:49.987 --> 34:52.922
Because l have a plan
to heal those patients.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.150
That's what doctors do--
we heal.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.490
So, choose-- what kind of doctor
are you going to be?

34:57.562 --> 35:00.190
The Medical Hologram
has 30 seconds to deactivation.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.027
You hear that?

35:05.236 --> 35:06.828
How can l get you
off this level?

35:06.971 --> 35:09.201
Deactivate my mobile emitter,

35:09.273 --> 35:11.070
and put it in inside
this selenide medkit.

35:11.142 --> 35:12.268
lt'll shield the signature.

35:12.343 --> 35:13.310
And then what?

35:13.411 --> 35:15.276
Take it to Level Red,
and reactivate me.

35:15.346 --> 35:18.179
What are you going to do
once you get to Level Red?

35:18.249 --> 35:21.241
The Medical Hologram has
ten seconds to deactivation.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.547
There's no time to explain.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.814
You'll have to trust me.

35:43.508 --> 35:46.477
l suspect young Dr.
Voje helped you escape.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.568
He had nothing to do with it.

35:48.646 --> 35:49.908
No matter.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.881
You're becoming
far too troublesome.

35:51.949 --> 35:54.417
l'm going to have to deactivate
your program.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.181
Voje!

35:58.756 --> 35:59.950
What's wrong with him?

36:00.024 --> 36:01.082
What are you doing?

36:01.125 --> 36:02.820
A little experiment in empathy.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.695
You told me you
were just developing

36:05.763 --> 36:06.730
new treatment protocols.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.287
A single protocol, actually.

36:08.366 --> 36:10.834
You're only making things worse
for yourself.

36:10.968 --> 36:13.129
As a matter of fact,
l'm making things worse for you.

36:13.237 --> 36:15.467
l'm going to make you a patient
in your own hospital.

36:19.377 --> 36:20.674
What was in that injector?

36:20.745 --> 36:22.406
A neural blocker.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.381
Combined with the same virus
that afflicted Tebbis.

36:25.449 --> 36:26.780
l trusted you.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.977
And Tebbis trusted me.

36:28.052 --> 36:29.713
You remember Tebbis, don't you?

36:29.787 --> 36:31.652
Patient R-12?

36:31.722 --> 36:34.885
Maybe this will jog your memory.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.516
What are you doing?

36:36.594 --> 36:38.391
Patient R-12.

36:38.462 --> 36:41.124
Species: Dinaal.
ldentity: Tebbis.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.895
This is ridiculous!
l'm not Tebbis!

36:44.035 --> 36:45.662
But the Allocator
thinks you are.

36:45.770 --> 36:46.828
How did you do...?

36:46.938 --> 36:49.065
Simple-- the Allocator
identifies patients

36:49.173 --> 36:50.470
by reading blood factors.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.509
l altered Chellick's
by injecting him

36:52.577 --> 36:54.238
with antigens from Tebbis.

36:54.312 --> 36:58.180
Now, why don't we see if we can
get your condition treated.

36:58.249 --> 36:59.716
Requesting
one cytoglobin injection

36:59.784 --> 37:00.716
for patient R-12.

37:00.818 --> 37:03.787
Treatment denied.

37:03.821 --> 37:06.289
l order you to medicate me now.

37:06.357 --> 37:09.292
Ordinarily, l would,

37:09.360 --> 37:12.227
but if the Allocator says
''No''...

37:12.296 --> 37:14.230
ls this some sort of revenge?

37:14.298 --> 37:15.595
Not revenge.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.293
Leverage.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.959
l want enough cytoglobin

37:19.070 --> 37:20.970
to cure every infected patient
on this level.

37:21.038 --> 37:23.598
We don't have
an adequate supply.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.767
There's plenty on Level Blue.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.640
Where it's being used
to prevent arterial aging.

37:28.713 --> 37:30.442
Those patients
will survive without it,

37:30.514 --> 37:32.311
but a dozen people
on this level won't.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.374
l will not let them die.

37:41.292 --> 37:42.224
Entering orbit.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.555
Scan for the Doctor's signature.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.095
He's dying.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.534
As soon as we get
the cytoglobin,

37:53.604 --> 37:55.572
we'll be able to treat
all the Level Red patients,

37:55.640 --> 37:56.732
including him.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.207
You said it yourself--
doctors heal.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.074
We don't make patients sick!

38:01.178 --> 38:03.442
l don't know any other way
to help these people.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.449
Dr. Voje...

38:07.718 --> 38:10.278
l need the medicine now.

38:10.354 --> 38:13.653
Sir, l only have
a Level Red clearance.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.385
You know l'm not authorized.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.519
Then find someone who is.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.238
l've got him.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.831
He's aboard a vessel
above the northern continent.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.841
Can you get a lock?

38:32.910 --> 38:34.309
lt's not going to be easy.

38:34.378 --> 38:35.811
His program
seems to be interfaced

38:35.880 --> 38:37.108
with the main computer.

38:37.181 --> 38:39.615
Hail the ship.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.676
They're responding;
audio only.

38:42.753 --> 38:44.653
This is Hospital Ship 42.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.020
Allocation Module Alpha.

38:47.091 --> 38:49.821
This is Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.794
l would like
to speak with someone

38:51.862 --> 38:55.059
regarding a member of my crew
who is aboard your vessel.

38:55.132 --> 38:57.566
Administrator Chellick
is currently unavailable.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.898
Then may l speak
with someone else?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.938
Only Administrator Chellick

39:01.972 --> 39:05.635
is authorized to communicate
with alien species.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.978
Are we having a problem here?

39:15.052 --> 39:17.577
Dysek. Finally.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.556
l-l'm sorry.
l had to tell him.

39:20.624 --> 39:23.115
What are you waiting for?

39:23.194 --> 39:24.456
Give me the cytoglobin.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.086
l don't think l can.

39:26.163 --> 39:27.630
What are you saying?

39:27.698 --> 39:30.326
Cytoglobin isn't authorized
for Level Red patients.

39:30.434 --> 39:31.128
Dysek!

39:31.235 --> 39:32.827
l don't want to break the rules.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.302
l made the rules!

39:34.372 --> 39:35.771
Then you should be pleased

39:35.840 --> 39:37.637
l hold them in such high regard.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.608
l'm sorry, Captain--
l can't transport him

39:39.677 --> 39:40.871
without damaging his matrix.

39:41.011 --> 39:42.808
Then you'll have
to go down there and get him.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.869
Aye, Captain.

39:44.014 --> 39:45.447
Chakotay.

39:50.254 --> 39:54.122
Don't tell me you're allied
with this defective hologram.

39:54.191 --> 39:57.649
No, but he has given me insight

39:57.728 --> 40:00.856
into some of the intricacies
of our system.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.865
For example, did you know

40:02.933 --> 40:05.527
if l don't request
enough resources

40:05.636 --> 40:07.570
for Level Blue this month,

40:07.638 --> 40:09.936
l won't get what l need
next month?

40:10.074 --> 40:11.905
What are you talking about?!

40:11.976 --> 40:13.944
You know, Doctor,
one way to increase

40:14.044 --> 40:16.376
your allocation of resources
on Level Blue

40:16.447 --> 40:19.416
would be to increase
the number of patients.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.474
l know at least a dozen people

40:21.552 --> 40:24.350
who should be treated
for arterial aging.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.222
Saving their lives would
be just a side effect.

40:28.292 --> 40:29.224
Hmm. Perhaps we should

40:29.293 --> 40:30.783
have them transferred
to Level Blue.

40:30.861 --> 40:33.056
lf you're looking
for a second opinion, l concur.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.224
Well... Chellick...
what do you think?

40:36.300 --> 40:37.494
lt's absurd!

40:37.601 --> 40:40.661
We'd have to transfer you
to Level Blue as well.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.796
You'd get your cytoglobin.

40:48.579 --> 40:49.944
Doctor.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.743
lt's nice to see
some friendly faces.

40:51.816 --> 40:52.840
We're gonna get you out of here.

40:52.917 --> 40:53.849
Who do we talk to

40:53.918 --> 40:55.283
about accessing
their main computer?

40:55.352 --> 40:57.149
l'll be with you in a moment.

40:57.221 --> 40:59.746
l'm with a... patient.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.022
Do we have an agreement?

41:04.995 --> 41:07.463
Yes.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.572
You've managed to stay
well while l was away.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.699
l'm giving you
a clean bill of health.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.107
You were only away four days.

41:21.178 --> 41:23.373
A lot can happen in four days--

41:23.447 --> 41:26.245
injuries, infections...
malfunctions.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.784
As you said, l'm fine.

41:27.852 --> 41:29.376
Thank you.

41:29.453 --> 41:31.353
l was wondering
if you'd mind doing me a favor?

41:31.422 --> 41:34.687
l'd like you
to give me a checkup.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.295
Have you been
experiencing problems?

41:39.363 --> 41:41.888
No, but as you said,

41:41.966 --> 41:44.332
l've been off the ship
for awhile,

41:44.435 --> 41:47.632
interfaced
with an alien computer.

41:49.607 --> 41:51.074
Your program appears
to be operating

41:51.175 --> 41:52.802
within normal parameters.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.708
Really?

41:54.778 --> 41:57.178
What about over
the past several days?

41:58.983 --> 42:02.612
There's no indication
of diminished capacity.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.780
No problems
with my ethical subroutines?

42:07.691 --> 42:09.283
None.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.191
l see.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.594
You seem disappointed.

42:19.136 --> 42:21.468
While l was aboard that ship...

42:21.539 --> 42:23.473
l poisoned a man.

42:23.541 --> 42:24.508
Deliberately?

42:24.575 --> 42:25.735
Yes.

42:25.809 --> 42:27.470
l was trying to force him

42:27.545 --> 42:29.274
to let me treat patients
who were dying.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.516
You were prepared
to sacrifice an individual

42:33.584 --> 42:35.347
to benefit a collective.

42:35.419 --> 42:37.353
No offense, Seven,

42:37.421 --> 42:40.447
but l don't exactly aspire
to Borg ideals.

42:43.928 --> 42:47.125
You were hoping your behavior
was the result of a malfunction.

42:50.901 --> 42:52.368
l'm sorry, Doctor,

42:52.469 --> 42:55.734
but l must give you
a clean bill of health.
