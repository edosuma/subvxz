WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:06.338
If I answer one of these
"Impossible" prayers,

00:06.340 --> 00:07.406
you spare Earth.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.007
It's a bet.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.543
All we have to do is get
these two people to kiss.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.345
Sam? Laura?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.280
Can I maybe get your number? Do
you want to hang out sometime?

00:15.282 --> 00:16.148
Yes.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.549
Yes! Yes!

00:17.551 --> 00:18.550
So sorry.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.818
Who's this guy?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.553
I ran in here
to get out of the rain.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.422
Once we started talking,
the rain stopped.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.890
Maybe it's a sign.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.159
Maybe.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.896
You know,
one of my goals in life

00:31.898 --> 00:34.299
is to find, like,
my own type of berry.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.834
Like a new special type
of berry.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.702
What the hell is happening?
We have to stop this.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.971
It's fine. It's fine.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.239
This is a brief conversation
with a stranger.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.775
Any second now,
she'll leave for work.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.777
I guess I should leave for work.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.245
You know, you could leave.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.380
For work.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.649
The endless routine.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.985
Or...

00:52.987 --> 00:54.787
Or what?

00:54.789 --> 00:58.323
We take our bikes.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.524
We ride.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.995
And just for today,
we grab life by the tail

01:02.997 --> 01:05.397
and live like this is it.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.865
Okay.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.867
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.068
No, no, no, no!

01:10.070 --> 01:11.603
Dope.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.614 --> 01:22.080
Do you mind if I...

01:25.686 --> 01:27.419
What is this?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.888
This feeling between us?

01:29.890 --> 01:31.490
I-Is this real?

01:31.492 --> 01:33.025
Whatisthis?

01:33.027 --> 01:34.359
I don't know.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.361
I want to keep finding out.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.631
No! He must have had it
taken out already.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.299
Yeah. Yeah.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.836
He's unstoppable. Okay,
we gotta ruin this date.

01:43.838 --> 01:46.104
Rain them out! On it.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.574
Rain sequence initiated.

01:49.576 --> 01:50.975
I guess we should leave.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.745
Ha ha! Wait.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.781
Shit.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.450
We made him hotter.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.853
You have opened me.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.521
You've made me new again.

02:02.523 --> 02:07.526
And, with your permission,

02:07.528 --> 02:09.594
I'd like for you to kiss me.

02:09.596 --> 02:10.663
What the

02:23.143 --> 02:24.743
I'll get more coffees.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.478
I'm so wet.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.510
Okay. Let's see
what we're up against.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.179
Okay. Mason. 26.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.982
His personal website
describes him

03:03.984 --> 03:09.254
as a conceptual artist
and an ambassador for truth.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.322
What?

03:10.324 --> 03:11.856
He makes these.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.726
We're more connected
than ever...

03:14.728 --> 03:16.194
butarewe?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.597
When's the last time
that you really connected?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.665
And not through your screen.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.002
But through your soul.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.739
Imagine a world where tweets
were for birds,

03:26.741 --> 03:29.074
the Web for a spider.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.476
Where we unplugged
from our phones

03:31.478 --> 03:34.346
and plugged into each other.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.014
What if it's here?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.882
What if it's now?

03:37.884 --> 03:38.951
The String Theory.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.619
Join the revolution at

03:40.621 --> 03:45.157
www.flashfundnow.com/
stringtheoryrevolutionwakeup.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.292
This is great.
Laura will lose interest

03:47.294 --> 03:48.693
the moment
she sees this bullshit.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.562
Right, she's already seen it.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.030
Several times.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.833
I figured it out.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.301
She's watching it on mute.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.437
She's just attracted to him.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.975
What about Sam?
Has he made any progress?

04:02.977 --> 04:06.445
This morning, he tried to text
Laura "hello" 16 times,

04:06.447 --> 04:08.180
but he couldn't work up
the nerve to press "send."

04:08.182 --> 04:10.115
And since then,
he has been attempting

04:10.117 --> 04:12.885
to put a fitted sheet
onto his mattress.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.459
I mean, to be fair,
those can be tricky.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.527
Okay, Sam doesn't have a chance
unless we ice this guy.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.263
Okay. I-I have never
"iced" anyone before.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.466
I'm not sure.
It sounds complicated.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.335
Craig, you've been
working here forever.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.870
No one knows this stuff
like you do.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.872
You can totally handle this.
You really think so?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.008
Yeah, man. You're the best.

04:36.010 --> 04:39.277
They say I'm the best.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.481
The greatest talent
to ever work in this department.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.615
And they're right.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.083
Hi, Craig.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.285
Hey, Sanjay.
What are you doing here?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.354
They're just doing
a little profile on me

04:49.356 --> 04:50.555
for "Gamechangers."

04:50.557 --> 04:51.824
"Gamechangers."

04:51.826 --> 04:54.292
Profiling the greatest
executives in the universe.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.629
Broadcasting weekly
to over 500 trillion viewers.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.366
A really important show.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.168
Never heard of it.
I just, wanted

05:03.170 --> 05:05.170
to show them
where I got my start.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.839
I can't believe
that guy used to work here.

05:06.841 --> 05:08.640
Yeah. Was he any good?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.974
I mean, he was fine.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.976
All his miracles
were pretty forgettable.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.246
This week's game changer
is the mastermind

05:14.248 --> 05:16.648
behind planet Earth's
most popular miracles...

05:16.650 --> 05:17.850
Captain Sully,

05:17.852 --> 05:20.118
the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.855
and, of course, the Octomom.

05:22.857 --> 05:25.524
That woman was in danger.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.593
It's better to be cautious
than to be a showboating hack.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.195
I don't know.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.930
Seems pretty talented.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.665
He's all style,
no substance, okay?

05:33.667 --> 05:34.799
Trust me.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.068
What?

05:36.070 --> 05:38.136
Safety's on.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.073
Yes! I was checking
the safety, Sanjay!

05:42.943 --> 05:45.009
Shall we go back to work?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.345
And then, of course,
there's Apollo 13.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.348
Fun fact... 13 is
actually my favorite number,

05:50.350 --> 05:51.950
so I was like, "I'm
definitely doing that one."

05:51.952 --> 05:53.952
Sanjay, you've told us
at some length

05:53.954 --> 05:55.420
about your past achievements,

05:55.422 --> 05:58.757
but I'd love to know
what your current job entails.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.760
Well, as executive archangel,

06:01.762 --> 06:04.629
I work directly with God,
our C.E.O.

06:04.631 --> 06:05.964
What's that like?

06:05.966 --> 06:08.633
Every day is an intense
intellectual challenge.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.102
Here.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.638
Speaking of which, duty calls.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.173
So, what's wrong
with the microwave?

06:15.175 --> 06:16.641
I'll tell you what's wrong.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.510
Nobody told me that,
in order to work it,

06:18.512 --> 06:19.912
you have to have
a science degree.

06:19.914 --> 06:22.247
What? Okay.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.051
All right, just pull it out
when you hear the ding.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.053
Easy peasy. Great.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.656
Love you, buddy. Okay.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.658
Love you.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.463
The adventure begins.

06:39.866 --> 06:43.335
Okay, so, I've got 15 ways
we can kill this Mason guy.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.270
One, we drop an anvil
on his head.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.539
Two, I found
this grand-piano factory

06:47.541 --> 06:50.542
on the ninth floor...
I worry that murdering Mason

06:50.544 --> 06:52.210
might traumatize Laura.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.413
Their relationship
seems to be getting serious.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.015
They just met yesterday.
How serious can it be?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.151
Well...

06:59.153 --> 07:00.619
You are my soul.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.988
You're the purpose of my heart.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.758
But there's something
you must know.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.025
What?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.961
The string revolution
is going global.

07:08.963 --> 07:10.629
Tonight, I fly to China.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.764
I'm going to tie a string

07:11.766 --> 07:14.833
to the iPhone manufacturing
plant in Zhengzhou

07:14.835 --> 07:16.901
and connect it
to the Songyue Pagoda

07:16.903 --> 07:19.037
on the summit
of the sacred Mount Song.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.906
It's about six weeks
of walking, at least.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.110
Good. He's leaving.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.111
I guess I'll see you
when you're back?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.448
Guess again.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.189
What if it's now?

07:37.191 --> 07:39.658
Take this leap.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.193
Be my muse.

07:41.195 --> 07:42.927
Come to China.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.798
Okay.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.265
Okay?

07:47.267 --> 07:48.667
Okay! Okay, okay.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.403
Okay! Yeah, okay! Okay! Okay.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.073
Maybe it's time
to bring in reinforcements.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.409
Well, what do you mean?

07:57.411 --> 07:59.678
What? No! No, absolutely not!

07:59.680 --> 08:02.948
We do not need him!
I can handle this!

08:04.351 --> 08:08.286
Safety. Yes! Safety... is on.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.326
People say, "Sanjay,
you're a loose cannon."

08:15.328 --> 08:17.128
I'm a maverick. A trailblazer.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.464
Here. B-R-B.

08:19.466 --> 08:22.267
Sanjay, is there any way
that we could tag along?

08:22.269 --> 08:24.469
We could really use
some footage of you in action.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.005
No. This is top-level stuff.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.207
"Need to know" only.

08:28.209 --> 08:30.809
So, what happened
to the pot pie?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.677
Buddy, let me tell you,
these pot pies,

08:32.679 --> 08:35.280
they aren't exactly what you
would call "user-friendly."

08:35.282 --> 08:36.881
I mean, it started out fine.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.885
I heard the ding, popped open
the door. There's my pie.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.687
I figure at this point,
I'm in the clear. Right.

08:41.688 --> 08:45.624
So I reach into
the microwave, grab the pie.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.893
And right away,
I knew something was wrong.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.694
Because this thing is hot!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.296
I'm talking, like, whoa!

08:51.298 --> 08:53.232
I mean, now I'm running around,

08:53.234 --> 08:55.100
and this thing
is burning my hands.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.303
And... And I'm shouting,
"Rosie, Rosie, get in here,"

08:58.305 --> 09:00.639
'cause, you know, I thought
she might know what to do.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.441
So she comes in. She's no help.

09:02.443 --> 09:04.309
She starts screaming,
"Well, drop it!

09:04.311 --> 09:07.178
Drop it! Why are you still
holding it?! Drop it!"

09:07.180 --> 09:09.848
And I'm like, "Drop it?
Are you crazy?"

09:09.850 --> 09:11.516
That's my lunch.

09:11.518 --> 09:14.319
Well, anyway, the point is,
these paws are outta commish.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.388
So I'm gonna need you
to make me a new pot pie

09:17.390 --> 09:19.258
and then feed it to me
one bite at a time,

09:19.260 --> 09:20.859
like I'm a little baby.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.662
You could have another pot pie.

09:23.664 --> 09:30.201
Or you could try
these cold-pressed juices.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.336
Yeah.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.739
Juice for lunch?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.540
That is a wild idea, man.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.075
All right.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.209
Thanks, buddy!

09:38.211 --> 09:39.945
Love you. Okay.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.616
Laura can't kiss Sam if she's
on a six-week trip to China.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.217
We need to bring in Sanjay.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.288
No, we don't, because
I have just handled it.

09:49.290 --> 09:50.956
What?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.491
Yeah. The trip is off. Look.

09:52.493 --> 09:55.294
In international news,
China's Zhengzhou Airport,

09:55.296 --> 09:57.162
celebrated for
its architectural beauty

09:57.164 --> 10:00.432
and pristine runways,
has been destroyed in a flood

10:00.434 --> 10:02.767
that scientists say
should have been impossible.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.303
I worry this newsroom
will experience

10:04.305 --> 10:06.105
a flood of its own tonight.

10:06.107 --> 10:08.974
I'm referring, of course,
to a flood of my own tears.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.842
Whoa! Great job.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.246
"All flights
canceled indefinitely."

10:15.248 --> 10:17.716
That's too bad.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.119
I was really looking forward
to going with you.

10:20.121 --> 10:22.121
And I, with you.

10:22.123 --> 10:23.722
But unfortunately, for now,

10:23.724 --> 10:27.392
the String Theory must remain
a string hypothesis.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.795
- Nice.
- Yes.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.996
Problem solved.

10:30.998 --> 10:34.599
Sanjay, we just need one shot
of you doing something,

10:34.601 --> 10:36.868
anything, related to your work.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.204
Here.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.539
I'll be right back.

10:44.345 --> 10:46.211
What's wrong? You...
You didn't like the juices?

10:46.213 --> 10:48.279
No, I-I loved the juices.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.816
But, buddy, they sure rocked
my tum-tum good.

10:53.354 --> 10:54.753
You know that scene in "Titanic"

10:54.755 --> 10:56.155
when all the people
are trying to get out

10:56.157 --> 10:57.956
and there's just
one tiny little gate

10:57.958 --> 10:59.558
just holding them all back?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.292
That gate is about to go,

11:01.294 --> 11:03.796
and I'm going to need
all hands on deck.

11:05.632 --> 11:06.898
No.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.967
I know you're not looking
forward to this experience,

11:08.969 --> 11:10.235
and, well, neither am I.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.237
But believe it or not,
there's a...

11:12.239 --> 11:13.438
There's a lesson here.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.774
That lesson is...

11:15.776 --> 11:18.043
Buddy, we gotta get in there.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.511
Wait, what about the lesson?

11:19.513 --> 11:20.779
There's no time for that.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.247
The train
is leaving the station,

11:22.249 --> 11:24.115
and, baby, it's an express.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.784
I love you, buddy!

11:25.786 --> 11:27.052
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

11:27.054 --> 11:30.121
It looks like Mason
is leaving Laura's apartment.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.526
What's wrong?

11:34.528 --> 11:38.797
I'm just trying to figure out
where I'm going to stay.

11:38.799 --> 11:39.798
What do you mean?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.267
In anticipation for my trip
to Zhengzhou,

11:42.269 --> 11:43.935
I gave up my apartment

11:43.937 --> 11:47.539
and put all my earthly
possessions in storage.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.008
So now I'm a man without a home.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.277
I'm a homeless man.

11:52.279 --> 11:57.616
Well, I guess you could stay
here for a little bit.

11:57.618 --> 12:00.151
Laura, God! Thank you!

12:00.153 --> 12:01.887
Wow, thank you.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.222
This is crazy.

12:03.224 --> 12:04.756
If the trip to China
hadn't been ruined,

12:04.758 --> 12:06.592
you would have never
asked me to move in.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.361
Feels like divine intervention.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.132
Thank you.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.967
I'm getting Sanjay.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.368
What? No! No, no, no, no!

12:17.370 --> 12:18.703
We... We can think
of something else...

12:18.705 --> 12:20.972
A breeze or something
involving a... a...

12:20.974 --> 12:22.107
Yeah, a breeze!

12:24.645 --> 12:29.248
Sorry, guys. Just had some
executive, you know, work.

12:30.451 --> 12:32.183
Slow down, please.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.786
Eliza, how can I convince you
that this is not a good idea?

12:34.788 --> 12:36.721
Hey! So sorry.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.725
Let's just print
this snowflake twice.

12:39.727 --> 12:41.993
Two can be the same.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.595
Who's gonna notice, Todd?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.997
Sanjay, we need
some footage that we can use.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.332
This is "Gamechangers."

12:47.334 --> 12:49.400
We have to see you
changing the game.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.469
Right.

12:50.471 --> 12:52.471
Okay. Go ahead. Ask him.

12:52.473 --> 12:54.273
Hang on.
Why do I have to ask him?

12:54.275 --> 12:56.075
You know him better.

12:56.077 --> 12:57.542
Come on.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.811
Hi, Sanjay.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.281
Sorry. Could you help us
with something?

13:03.751 --> 13:05.284
Hey, Craig!

13:08.489 --> 13:10.555
This happens constantly.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.891
A lower-level employee
has, some problem

13:12.893 --> 13:16.495
that's beyond his skill set,
so he comes to me. Yeah.

13:16.497 --> 13:21.633
Um, like a student to a teacher,
or a child to a man.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.235
So, what do you need, Craig?

13:24.237 --> 13:27.172
Your help with something.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.509
Would you say you need to me
to change your game?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.444
Yeah.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.180
Yes, Sanjay, please.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.048
Please change my game.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.651
Whoops. We had
a little sound issue.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.787
Craig, could you say that again,
much louder?

13:41.789 --> 13:45.457
Yeah, Sanjay,
please change my game.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.926
Sure thing, little buddy.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.061
I think we got it.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.131
Thank you so much
for bailing us out, Sanjay.

13:52.133 --> 13:53.332
Can you come right now?

13:53.334 --> 13:55.801
Sure. I don't see why not.

13:55.803 --> 13:59.004
Sanjay, he says, "Another train
is leaving the station",

13:59.006 --> 14:00.939
and, baby, it's a bullet train.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.809
"The midnight
Tokyo to Osaka express."

14:03.811 --> 14:07.212
"The conductor's
hopped up on greenies,"

14:07.214 --> 14:08.747
and his pedal's to the metal.

14:08.749 --> 14:11.150
He's got a need for speed.

14:11.152 --> 14:14.019
The train is literally shooting
out of the tunnel right now.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.955
"Mama. Please come immediately."

14:16.957 --> 14:18.824
I'll be down in five.

14:29.770 --> 14:31.370
Can't tell if we're through this

14:31.372 --> 14:32.971
or just in the eye of the storm.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.240
It was the eye. It was the eye.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.986
Sanjay! Sanjay, wait!

14:46.988 --> 14:48.920
Great job, dude.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.923
You got rid
of the one guy we needed.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.860
Sanjay, call Al Roker.

14:54.862 --> 14:57.529
This storm's gonna need a name.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.907
- Hey, Sanjay.
- Hi, Craig.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.041
Good one.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.510
You... You got me. That was...

15:11.512 --> 15:13.312
I loved it.

15:13.314 --> 15:15.714
I...

15:15.716 --> 15:19.851
I-I am... really sorry
that I just did that.

15:19.853 --> 15:23.188
Why? No, you showed
everyone the truth.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.656
Yeah, I'm pathetic.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.525
I don't do anything.

15:26.527 --> 15:30.261
Well, maybe not up here.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.464
But come on. Down in Prayers,
you were the best.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.933
Everyone thinks so.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.535
Not you.

15:36.537 --> 15:38.337
No, you think
I'm a showboating hack.

15:38.339 --> 15:39.938
No. No, you said it.
I heard you.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.206
You said "showboating hack."

15:41.208 --> 15:43.542
Yes, because I was jealous.

15:43.544 --> 15:45.677
And you might be a showboat,

15:45.679 --> 15:48.647
but you are
definitely not a hack.

15:51.885 --> 15:55.154
And we really, really need you.

15:55.156 --> 15:56.855
Will you still help us?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.827
Do my eyes look puffy?

16:01.829 --> 16:03.695
No. No, not at all.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.630
Be honest.
No, no, you look great.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.166
- Doesn't he look great?
- He looks great.

16:07.168 --> 16:09.234
You look great.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.003
Yeah, I'll help you.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.905
All right.
Give me something on this guy.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.240
What does he do for a living?

16:15.242 --> 16:17.509
He's a professional thought
leader and brand disrupter.

16:17.511 --> 16:19.444
Those aren't real jobs.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.580
He must be rich.
What do his parents do?

16:21.582 --> 16:23.849
Holy shit!

16:23.851 --> 16:25.951
His dad
owns Royal Britannia Oil.

16:27.521 --> 16:29.388
Time to change the game.

16:31.192 --> 16:33.258
Okay. I've rerouted
the oil tanker.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.594
Perfect. Crash it into that
deep-sea drill and light it up.

16:37.398 --> 16:39.464
I can't get any closer.
We're gonna lose our window!

16:39.466 --> 16:40.599
I'll send a tidal wave.

16:40.601 --> 16:41.933
No, that'll capsize it!

16:41.935 --> 16:43.402
What about, just a... a breeze?

16:43.404 --> 16:44.603
Great idea. Yes.

16:44.605 --> 16:46.905
Yeah? Okay.
Let's see what we have.

16:47.541 --> 16:48.540
Safety.

16:48.542 --> 16:49.674
Yes. Thank you.

16:50.211 --> 16:52.878
Breeze sequence initiated.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.347
Hey, hey! The world weeps today

16:56.349 --> 16:58.283
in the wake
of a massive oil spill

16:58.285 --> 17:01.086
just one mile from the
cherished Galápagos Islands.

17:01.088 --> 17:04.823
The images of sea turtles
caked in oil, gasping for air,

17:04.825 --> 17:06.958
will not soon leave
my nightmares.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.426
Meanwhile, the company
at fault...

17:08.429 --> 17:10.095
Royal Britannia Oil...

17:10.097 --> 17:13.364
Is in financial free fall
as their stock price plummets.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.035
Okay! So, we have caused
a gigantic oil spill,

17:16.037 --> 17:19.104
and Mason's dad's
company's is ruined.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.106
Now what?

17:21.642 --> 17:23.242
You'll see.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.175
I mean, not to be rude,
but I'll probably make a lot

17:25.178 --> 17:26.912
- of changes around the house.
- Hey, sir.

17:26.914 --> 17:28.714
I'm sorry, but your...
Your card was declined.

17:28.716 --> 17:30.381
Okay, what?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.384
Boy.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.920
Daddy, what the "F"?!

17:34.922 --> 17:38.523
Why did you cancel
my credit card?!

17:38.525 --> 17:40.859
Co... Oil spill?

17:40.861 --> 17:43.528
Oil spill. So what, bitch?

17:45.266 --> 17:46.331
Look, look, look, look.

17:47.801 --> 17:51.670
I need $7,000 right now!

17:51.672 --> 17:55.474
Dad, please.
I said "pl... "I said "please"!

17:55.476 --> 17:57.476
This is my allowance.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.012
Yes!

18:01.014 --> 18:02.614
- Yes! Ooh, what a meltdown!
- Yes!

18:02.616 --> 18:05.016
I almost feel bad for him. Wow.

18:05.018 --> 18:07.286
You know,
sometimes a little humility

18:07.288 --> 18:08.887
can be good for someone.

18:08.889 --> 18:11.222
Maybe he'll learn something.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.592
Or maybe not. Whatever.

18:14.762 --> 18:17.062
Put Mom on, you bitch!

18:42.356 --> 18:44.756
I mean, it comes off one...
It's on one side,

18:44.758 --> 18:45.891
and then
it comes off the other side.

18:45.893 --> 18:47.693
Those can be tricky.

18:47.695 --> 18:48.894
Okay, let's just try it again,

18:48.896 --> 18:51.229
but be a little bit more
methodical this time.

18:54.702 --> 18:56.368
Nana, I-I'm so sorry.

18:56.370 --> 18:57.836
I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

18:57.838 --> 18:59.371
Okay. Love you.

18:59.373 --> 19:00.438
Love you.

19:13.387 --> 19:14.652
Yes. Yes!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.454
Back on track!

19:16.456 --> 19:17.856
Thanks again for your help,
Sanjay.

19:17.858 --> 19:19.591
Yes. It is too bad
you can't stick around.

19:20.928 --> 19:23.461
Maybe I will. What?

19:23.463 --> 19:28.133
It feels so good to actually
do something for a change.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.001
This is where I belong.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.737
Awesome!
Doesn't God need you for...

19:31.739 --> 19:33.138
Unh-unh.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.340
Okay. We got a lot
of work ahead of us.

19:34.342 --> 19:36.274
Maybe we should make
some coffee.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.544
Good call. Craig, would you
mind making us some coffee?

19:40.080 --> 19:41.813
Of course. Yes.

19:41.815 --> 19:43.015
I'll be right back.

19:43.017 --> 19:44.550
Thank you. Thank you.

19:44.552 --> 19:45.884
Okay.

19:45.886 --> 19:47.419
Okay. He's sending a meme.

19:47.421 --> 19:50.088
Don't, Sam. Don't! No, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.489
Cancel, cancel.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.825
Sometimes life
doesn't always go your way.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.961
Some things you can't control.

19:55.963 --> 19:57.963
So control what you can.

19:57.965 --> 20:00.766
Dance your dance,
sing your song,

20:00.768 --> 20:02.901
and cherish the small things.

20:02.903 --> 20:05.237
Because this moment...

20:05.239 --> 20:07.172
it's already passed.

20:07.174 --> 20:08.907
But here's another one.

20:08.909 --> 20:10.375
And another one.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.245
So seize it. Live it.

20:13.247 --> 20:16.782
'Cause what
if it really is... now?

20:16.784 --> 20:18.316
The String Theory.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.851
Join the revolution at
www.flashfund...

20:19.853 --> 20:22.921
Finally. Someone gets it.

20:24.124 --> 20:25.991
Sanjay!

20:25.993 --> 20:29.060
You gotta see this!

20:29.062 --> 20:30.862
Sanjay?

20:30.864 --> 20:33.465
Rosie?

20:33.467 --> 20:35.067
Someone gets it!
