00:59.210 --> 01:00.002
- Got...

01:01.419 --> 01:02.835
The rest.

01:02.876 --> 01:04.126
Sorry.

01:04.167 --> 01:04.959
Okay.

01:35.203 --> 01:36.869
I don't know if I've
play this map before,

01:36.910 --> 01:38.619
this is a new one.

01:38.661 --> 01:40.744
It doesn't matter, I
have some brand new kush

01:40.786 --> 01:42.326
to help me kick some ass,

01:42.368 --> 01:44.326
which I don't know
if I mentioned yet,

01:44.368 --> 01:48.492
but I sort of swindled myself
into an abundant amount,

01:48.534 --> 01:53.408
not a crazy amount, but I
ripped Darryl off for the day.

01:53.449 --> 01:55.074
I told him I needed
a certain amount,

01:55.116 --> 01:58.699
but I definitely did not give
him enough money to pay for it

01:58.740 --> 02:01.656
and just rode off before
he could count the change.

02:01.698 --> 02:05.406
It wasn't
a big amount, right,

02:05.447 --> 02:06.863
it was just an extra bud,

02:06.904 --> 02:09.029
and I thought I had
made my clean getaway.

02:09.071 --> 02:11.445
This guy, it turns into
an epic bike chase.

02:11.487 --> 02:12.862
He's like chasin'
me down the streets,

02:12.903 --> 02:14.903
a neighborhood I have
no idea about, right,

02:14.945 --> 02:16.861
so it's like, I'm
just takin' like,

02:16.902 --> 02:18.695
turn down this alley,
turn down this street,

02:18.736 --> 02:20.319
almost runnin' into parked cars,

02:20.361 --> 02:23.277
last second swerving out of
the way like a crazy champ.

02:23.318 --> 02:25.068
And he's chasin'
me through it all!

02:25.110 --> 02:26.900
He almost like pushed me
off my bike at one point.

02:26.942 --> 02:28.109
Ding, ding, ding, goes his bell,

02:28.150 --> 02:29.693
he's just tryin' to
like run me down.

02:29.734 --> 02:31.817
I don't know what her was
gonna do if he did catch me.

02:31.858 --> 02:33.441
What, would I just
apologize and give it back?

02:33.483 --> 02:35.983
I don't know, I mean,
he's not a terrible guy,

02:36.024 --> 02:38.107
but he's been kind of droppin'
the ball as a dealer lately,

02:38.148 --> 02:40.524
and that is why I'll say I
think he kind of deserved it.

02:40.566 --> 02:42.314
I mean, I don't
really feel too bad,

02:42.356 --> 02:44.356
again, it was a small amount.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.188
It could have been a lot worse.

02:46.230 --> 02:50.021
Like what if someone had
robbed him at weapon point?

02:50.063 --> 02:52.020
Right, like a gun, or
a knife, or something?

02:52.062 --> 02:53.854
I don't think it's
too different, I mean,

02:53.895 --> 02:55.187
like maybe a gun,
I don't really know

02:55.229 --> 02:56.812
how I would go about
getting something like that.

02:56.853 --> 02:58.144
But a knife you can get,

02:58.186 --> 02:59.978
there's all sorts
of like, you know,

03:00.019 --> 03:03.602
mountain biking or hiking shops
that sell stuff like that,

03:03.644 --> 03:04.644
it's a useful tool.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.810
I could have stolen his money!

03:06.851 --> 03:09.726
All his weed, right, like
someone else is probably

03:09.768 --> 03:11.350
gonna do that at some point,

03:11.392 --> 03:14.684
and if I hadn't prepped him
by robbing him the other day

03:14.725 --> 03:18.808
he'd of probably gotten
hurt or much worse, right.

03:18.849 --> 03:20.599
I am showing him
that the business

03:20.641 --> 03:22.181
he is in can be dangerous,

03:22.223 --> 03:24.848
and he needs to be prepared
for something like that.

03:24.889 --> 03:27.430
So, he said I'm on his
blacklist now though,

03:27.472 --> 03:28.847
whatever that means.

03:28.888 --> 03:30.222
Maybe he's gonna
send people after me.

03:30.264 --> 03:32.929
Fuck this guy, he's
not layin' off.

05:10.867 --> 05:12.576
- Hey guys,
today I'm gonna teach you

05:12.618 --> 05:13.951
how to solve one of
the biggest mysteries

05:13.992 --> 05:15.825
ever known to civilization.

05:15.866 --> 05:16.784
The infamous--

05:16.825 --> 05:17.991
With your hand or a knife,

05:18.033 --> 05:19.283
and dislodge all the pieces

05:19.325 --> 05:22.366
so you can rearrange
until it's solved.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.282
But, so this is cheating,

05:25.323 --> 05:27.031
and it's not as impressive
as actually solving it

05:27.073 --> 05:28.823
in front of a real person.

05:28.864 --> 05:30.322
But in order to
actually solve it,

05:30.364 --> 05:34.113
you're gonna need to know
the notations and algorithms.

05:34.155 --> 05:37.987
So first one, left, you gotta
twist the left side clockwise.

05:38.029 --> 05:41.820
So first one, left, you gotta
twist the left side clockwise

05:41.861 --> 05:43.070
by one full rot--

05:43.111 --> 05:44.362
With the algorithms,

05:44.403 --> 05:46.569
this is one the most
important algorithms.

05:46.611 --> 05:50.735
Right inverted, right
inverted, right down.

05:50.777 --> 05:52.360
Do that six times,

05:52.401 --> 05:54.276
and the cubes will go back
in the original position.

05:54.318 --> 05:55.692
So, like this.

05:55.734 --> 05:57.150
One.

05:57.192 --> 05:58.484
Two.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.108
Three.

06:00.149 --> 06:00.941
Four.

06:01.899 --> 06:03.107
Five.

06:03.149 --> 06:04.441
- Aaron.

06:04.483 --> 06:06.190
- See? Okay, awesome.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.273
So, now let's go ahead--

06:07.315 --> 06:08.732
- Aaron.

06:08.774 --> 06:10.314
- Yeah?

06:10.356 --> 06:14.272
- There's some
mail person here to see you.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.228
- Do I need
to sign for it?

06:27.269 --> 06:29.645
- Actually, you
have to pay for it

06:29.686 --> 06:32.685
because it's a
payment upon receipt.

06:32.727 --> 06:35.601
- Really? Okay, that's weird.

06:35.643 --> 06:36.850
Just give me a sec.

06:36.892 --> 06:38.226
- So, what is ISIS?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.559
Who is the Islamic State?

06:39.601 --> 06:40.558
Where does it come from?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.642
What does it want? And why?

06:42.683 --> 06:44.849
Let's work through
these questions to
get a better picture.

06:44.890 --> 06:47.516
To begin, ISIS is the
illegitimate love child

06:47.557 --> 06:51.556
of Saddam Hussein's regime of
the terrorist group, al-Qaeda.

06:52.515 --> 06:54.181
- With a card? Great.

06:56.639 --> 07:00.304
- Which has
allowed ISIS to rise to power.

07:00.346 --> 07:01.763
- There you go.

07:01.804 --> 07:03.012
- Some members of al-Qaeda

07:03.054 --> 07:04.554
moved from Afghanistan
into Iraq in order

07:04.596 --> 07:06.512
to fight the US who
invaded and overthrew

07:06.553 --> 07:08.220
Saddam Hussein in 2003.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.802
- It's not...

07:10.843 --> 07:11.843
I don't know.

07:13.427 --> 07:15.926
I can't pay for it now, though.

07:16.884 --> 07:18.551
I see it's from my mom though.

07:18.593 --> 07:20.175
It might as well
just get sent back?

07:20.217 --> 07:22.550
Is it okay if I just keep it?

07:23.759 --> 07:25.840
- No, I have to receive payment.

07:25.882 --> 07:28.090
- I'm sure she just
messed something up.

07:28.132 --> 07:29.798
- Well, you could try
calling her if you want,

07:29.839 --> 07:31.923
and she could pay for it.

07:32.881 --> 07:34.631
- I can't keep it now though?

07:34.672 --> 07:36.380
- No, sorry, you don't
have another card?

07:36.422 --> 07:37.838
- No, that's it.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.464
- Yeah, sorry, there's
nothing I can do.

07:39.506 --> 07:40.296
- Alright.

07:44.129 --> 07:45.420
- In the early years,

07:45.462 --> 07:47.212
Baghdad belonged to al-Qaeda.

07:47.253 --> 07:51.294
However, in 2015, they
supplied orders from the camp

07:51.336 --> 07:53.711
and declared the group as
now the Islamic State of Iraq

07:53.753 --> 07:57.752
and Syria, know by its
acronym, I-S-I-S, ISIS.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.747
- Hi, accounts?

08:36.909 --> 08:38.452
- All representatives are currently

08:38.494 --> 08:40.366
busy assisting other customers.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.326
Please hold, and your
call will be answered

08:42.366 --> 08:44.366
in the order it was received.

09:24.858 --> 09:25.900
All representatives
are currently

09:25.941 --> 09:27.900
busy assisting other customers.

09:27.941 --> 09:29.899
Please hold, and your
call will be answered

09:29.940 --> 09:31.774
in the order it was received.

09:43.647 --> 09:47.021
- Hi, customer service,
how may I help you?

09:47.062 --> 09:48.229
Hello?

09:48.271 --> 09:49.770
Hello?

09:49.811 --> 09:52.936
- Yeah, I'm having an
issue with my account.

09:52.978 --> 09:54.311
- Who of you would like

09:54.352 --> 09:56.186
to make more money?

09:56.227 --> 09:59.018
- I'm unemployed, so stop asking me,

09:59.059 --> 10:03.059
oh what do you do,
you use.

10:05.559 --> 10:06.892
- She told me she thought

10:06.933 --> 10:08.142
I'd be perfect for the job.

10:08.184 --> 10:09.891
I was just the sort of
person who could say,

10:09.932 --> 10:12.974
"Go yourself,"
to the board,

10:13.016 --> 10:16.806
and especially not one where
the board is behaving badly.

10:19.972 --> 10:21.889
- Now, a very small group of people

10:21.930 --> 10:26.305
have made over 3.1 million
dollars using this method.

10:26.346 --> 10:29.179
Most of them never even
been online before.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.262
Now, I'm gonna help a
million more people,

10:31.304 --> 10:32.762
and that includes you.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.344
If you don't watch till
the end of this video,

10:34.386 --> 10:35.969
I can't help you.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.678
But if you make it,

10:37.720 --> 10:41.051
you'll be walking out of here
with a $3,000 a month method.

10:41.093 --> 10:43.676
Risk-free, guaranteed.

10:43.718 --> 10:45.800
Don't believe me? Keep watching.

10:45.842 --> 10:47.134
You wanna spend
time with your kids,

10:47.176 --> 10:49.383
you've got dogs,
you wanna cook more.

10:49.425 --> 10:52.175
Hey, we get it, you're
looking for a way to make

10:52.216 --> 10:54.424
some quick cash from home.

10:54.466 --> 10:56.757
This method is what
you need to launch you

10:56.798 --> 10:58.715
on the path to success.

10:58.756 --> 11:00.631
Now, I didn't
invent this method,

11:00.673 --> 11:01.964
but I got to the top,

11:02.006 --> 11:04.297
and made $4,000
bucks in one month

11:04.338 --> 11:06.755
just by doing what I was told.

11:37.166 --> 11:37.957
- Hey Mom.

11:42.956 --> 11:43.788
I'm okay.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.289
I'm alright.

11:50.538 --> 11:51.912
That you mailed?

11:53.037 --> 11:54.995
Yeah, yeah, no, it came.

11:55.036 --> 11:57.662
I wasn't able to keep it though.

11:58.827 --> 12:01.119
The mailman, he was
pretty insistent

12:01.161 --> 12:04.160
it was a pay on
delivery, I think.

12:04.201 --> 12:08.200
Maybe by accident or
somethin' you maybe had that.

12:09.659 --> 12:12.033
So yeah, it's probably
on its way back to you

12:12.075 --> 12:14.199
at this point to be honest.

12:16.991 --> 12:19.823
Yeah, it's, I mean, I'm sure
it's an easy enough thing

12:19.865 --> 12:23.864
to mix up if you're doin' it
online or somethin' maybe.

12:25.989 --> 12:29.363
I was, it was a decent
size, so I mean,

12:29.405 --> 12:32.904
a few things, I
guess it could be.

12:32.946 --> 12:36.820
But once it's here, I'll
be sure to let you know.

12:40.653 --> 12:41.570
Yeah, yeah.

12:44.527 --> 12:47.152
So, as far as this month goes,

12:47.193 --> 12:51.192
I was wondering if maybe you
could help out with the rent?

12:55.316 --> 12:56.692
Uhh...

12:56.733 --> 12:57.525
All of it.

13:05.648 --> 13:06.440
Eh...

13:07.648 --> 13:08.439
Yeah.

13:10.147 --> 13:14.521
I know, I think, probably
now that I'm here,

13:14.563 --> 13:18.894
it'd be best to stay, and
like, just continue to try

13:18.936 --> 13:22.769
and work from, I think it'd
be too much of a step back

13:24.144 --> 13:26.852
at this point if
I were to go back.

13:37.225 --> 13:38.015
Yeah...

13:41.224 --> 13:42.848
I'm not sure where
you're calling from,

13:42.889 --> 13:46.223
but I think this is
a long distance call,

13:46.265 --> 13:48.556
so I think maybe we're
just gonna have to

13:48.597 --> 13:50.556
continue this chat later,

13:50.597 --> 13:52.514
and I may have to go.

13:52.556 --> 13:54.846
Yeah, you too, okay, bye-bye.

14:01.053 --> 14:01.845
Stupid.

14:06.302 --> 14:08.718
- ISIS troops are well-armed.

14:08.759 --> 14:11.926
Their video shows how an ISIS
expert checks information

14:11.968 --> 14:14.384
in an on-line wanted database.

14:19.466 --> 14:22.756
Arabic subtitles
hopefully get the details.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.881
This member of the
liberal government

14:25.923 --> 14:29.131
is recorded in the
Jihadist search list.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.755
He will be executed on the spot.

14:34.088 --> 14:36.505
Such activities are
meticulously recorded

14:36.547 --> 14:39.753
in an ISIS annual
report 400 pages long.

14:41.295 --> 14:43.877
7,681 times ISIS
attacked in 2013.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.960
From suicide bombs
to sniper shots,

14:49.001 --> 14:50.793
everything was recorded.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.583
In the Washington based
Institute for the Study of War,

15:00.625 --> 15:04.165
a team led by Jessica Lewis
analyzed the ISIS report.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.707
- This reminds us all so much

15:05.748 --> 15:08.289
of an annual record that
a company would produce

15:08.331 --> 15:12.330
that perhaps ISIS is showcasing
its performance for...

16:35.481 --> 16:36.523
- I'm gonna go sit down.

16:36.564 --> 16:37.355
- Okay.

16:51.061 --> 16:52.851
You can do one of those?

16:52.893 --> 16:56.560
- Yeah, for the most part.

16:56.602 --> 16:58.101
- Do you have like a method?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.684
- Yeah, it's all
algorithms that you use,

17:00.725 --> 17:03.974
just a series of
steps to, you know,

17:04.016 --> 17:07.557
like okay, I move
these these to here

17:07.598 --> 17:09.348
without moving this one
out of the way, right,

17:09.391 --> 17:10.682
as soon as it comes in.

17:10.723 --> 17:12.598
So, if I go--
- Oh shit.

17:15.931 --> 17:17.930
Aha.

17:17.971 --> 17:19.680
- You can go right
counterclockwise,
or clock, yeah,

17:19.721 --> 17:22.970
counterclockwise,
bottom counterclockwise,

17:23.012 --> 17:26.512
right clockwise, and
then, now this one's here

17:26.553 --> 17:29.303
if this all is remaining.

17:29.345 --> 17:32.219
And it's just steps like that
to get, you know, one side,

17:32.260 --> 17:34.427
then you get the next layer
doing the same thing--

17:34.469 --> 17:36.052
- How do you get those two over?

17:36.094 --> 17:37.093
- You can...

17:37.134 --> 17:38.093
- Are you coming?

17:38.134 --> 17:39.093
- Yeah.

17:39.134 --> 17:40.385
- Okay.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.716
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.045
- Yo yo.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.629
- Yo.

18:10.670 --> 18:13.378
- So, print and
internet went up.

18:14.752 --> 18:15.586
- Yeah.

18:21.626 --> 18:23.667
Is that your girlfriend?

18:23.708 --> 18:25.833
- The other day?

18:25.875 --> 18:26.707
Yeah.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.957
- She good?

18:29.999 --> 18:30.791
- Yeah.

18:45.704 --> 18:47.662
- Welp, cool, cool.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.284
- So, should I stop the timer?

19:02.326 --> 19:05.034
You're over ten minutes.

19:05.076 --> 19:06.408
- Yeah, that same thing
happened to me again,

19:06.450 --> 19:08.367
I keep on trying to get
these corner pieces in,

19:08.408 --> 19:10.658
but there's something else in
the way in the first place,

19:10.699 --> 19:13.282
and it's doubling my
time when I'm just

19:13.324 --> 19:15.906
trying to get the
second row done.

19:17.697 --> 19:18.490
No way.

19:21.113 --> 19:25.113
There's no way that they could
have gone that far though.

19:27.613 --> 19:28.654
What?

19:28.695 --> 19:29.488
Really?

19:31.487 --> 19:33.070
After all that time?

19:42.276 --> 19:44.276
That is disgusting, wow.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.775
No, no, that would...

19:50.567 --> 19:52.732
I don't wish that on anyone.

19:53.732 --> 19:54.566
Ah.

19:57.231 --> 19:58.023
Ugh.

20:00.482 --> 20:02.022
I like all of those things.

20:02.064 --> 20:05.896
I wouldn't wanna do
without that at all.

20:05.937 --> 20:06.729
Eee.

21:57.541 --> 22:00.582
So, the printer is out of ink.

22:00.623 --> 22:03.373
I think it's your
turn to get more.

22:03.415 --> 22:04.540
- Oh yeah?

22:04.582 --> 22:05.331
- Yes.

22:05.372 --> 22:07.331
- Okay, okay.

22:07.372 --> 22:09.788
Oh wait, do you wanna
just, if you get it now,

22:09.830 --> 22:13.996
then we can just roll
it into internet later.

22:14.038 --> 22:17.537
- You mean you'll cover
the next internet?

22:17.579 --> 22:19.994
- Well, I'll cover this internet.

22:20.036 --> 22:22.578
- Right, right, but
I think in general

22:22.619 --> 22:25.243
we need the ink now anyways.

22:25.285 --> 22:26.993
- Okay.

22:27.035 --> 22:29.868
- So, yes, and I see
what you're saying.

22:29.908 --> 22:33.534
I do recall, however, the
last time we got pizza

22:33.576 --> 22:36.657
it was $20, I think,
and I fronted $15.

22:37.533 --> 22:39.450
Not that you owe all of that,

22:39.491 --> 22:42.615
but at least the extra five
that would've been yours.

22:42.656 --> 22:44.615
- Wait, so do
you want five dollars,

22:44.656 --> 22:46.864
or do you want the ink?

22:46.905 --> 22:49.323
- The ink, definitely the ink.

22:51.155 --> 22:53.572
- Yeah, I mean, there's that,

22:53.613 --> 22:56.279
and then toilet
paper that I got.

22:58.653 --> 23:00.611
- You got the toilet
paper last time?

23:00.652 --> 23:01.777
Did I not pitch some up front

23:01.819 --> 23:03.986
because I got detergent as well.

23:04.028 --> 23:06.735
I feel like we usually get
those at the same time.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.900
- Well, but they
sort of even themselves out.

23:09.942 --> 23:14.858
- Really, I think detergent
was like $12, $13 or something.

23:14.899 --> 23:16.983
- Where are you getting detergent?

23:17.025 --> 23:17.816
- Umm...

23:19.275 --> 23:20.607
- Yeah, it should be less.

23:20.648 --> 23:23.648
- I think it's like a
fabric softener as well,

23:23.690 --> 23:26.106
so like a two in
one or something.

23:26.148 --> 23:29.938
- Okay, so,
sorry, but you want...

23:29.980 --> 23:32.980
But it's still mathematic,
like I still come out,

23:33.022 --> 23:34.355
we could still do this--

23:34.397 --> 23:35.854
- Yeah, because it's what--

23:35.895 --> 23:37.438
- We could still you just get the ink,

23:37.479 --> 23:38.604
and then that's fine.

23:38.645 --> 23:41.853
Because it's the $15
minus toilet paper.

23:43.562 --> 23:47.436
- But then plus, like minus
from what you owe, or...

23:49.601 --> 23:52.101
Because then when
we add detergent...

23:52.143 --> 23:52.851
Phil Salib.

23:54.393 --> 23:55.891
I am Phil Salib at...

23:58.058 --> 23:59.682
2392.

24:01.266 --> 24:02.057
Yep, yes.

24:03.433 --> 24:05.432
Phil Salib, right, 2392.

24:07.557 --> 24:10.264
That's Phil Salib
at 2392 street.

24:13.014 --> 24:16.804
Manager at Mama's Pizza,
right, Phil Salib, not Aaron.

24:18.305 --> 24:20.304
Phil Salib, mmm-hmm, 2392.

24:38.467 --> 24:41.757
Hi, yeah, I'd like to
change my PIN number.

24:44.257 --> 24:46.048
Yeah, it's Phil Salib.

24:53.589 --> 24:54.505
Yeah, 7133.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.919
Yeah, yeah.

25:05.961 --> 25:08.295
Expiration date you've got...

25:09.585 --> 25:10.751
October of 2017.

25:15.126 --> 25:16.042
Yeah, it's...

25:17.042 --> 25:17.834
2392.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.374
Do you need the postal code too?

25:24.416 --> 25:26.999
Yeah, M6S...

25:34.580 --> 25:36.997
Oh, I didn't think
that was something

25:37.038 --> 25:39.704
I could just do over the phone.

25:39.745 --> 25:43.579
Just, you know, for
protection and everything.

25:45.078 --> 25:48.578
Identity theft is always
an issue with that, right.

25:53.494 --> 25:55.867
Is there other information
I could give you instead?

25:55.909 --> 25:58.576
It's just I don't
feel comfortable

25:58.617 --> 26:00.950
saying the social
insurance number.

26:00.992 --> 26:04.491
Yeah, like, I'm a manager
for Mama's Pizza right now,

26:04.533 --> 26:07.116
I've been doin' that since 2012.

26:07.157 --> 26:10.698
Before that I was meat
clerk for a meat market.

26:10.739 --> 26:12.823
Did that from 2009 to 2011.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.447
I can, yeah, yeah, it's...

26:19.946 --> 26:22.571
I can get you a Linkedin account

26:22.612 --> 26:24.945
that has all this
information as well.

26:24.987 --> 26:25.695
It's got...

26:36.776 --> 26:40.942
I mean, of course, I can assure
you I am who I am, right.

26:40.984 --> 26:44.899
I think it should just be
as easy as telling you.

26:47.149 --> 26:47.857
Okay, yeah.

27:10.395 --> 27:13.103
- Hey guys, Dean Tardioli here,

27:13.144 --> 27:17.143
doin' a neknomination video
as you can probably tell.

27:18.642 --> 27:22.268
So, what we're thinkin'
is first I wanna thank

27:24.724 --> 27:29.057
my good buddy, Matt
Mitchell, for nominating me.

27:29.099 --> 27:31.557
Thanks man, you
really nailed yours,

27:31.598 --> 27:33.099
so I thought I'd up mine.

27:33.140 --> 27:35.556
I'm going for two shots here,

27:35.597 --> 27:39.013
and I expect those that I
nominate to go for more.

27:39.055 --> 27:41.305
So, let's get to it.

27:41.347 --> 27:43.013
Here we go, bottoms up.

27:53.469 --> 27:56.552
That's good, that's
good, alright.

27:56.593 --> 27:57.885
I'm a nominate...

28:00.093 --> 28:04.550
Let's see here, Emily
Keys, Marcus Sullivan,

28:04.591 --> 28:08.632
and tallest man alive,
Aaron Keogh, alright.

28:08.674 --> 28:11.508
Pizza to wash down the alcohol,

28:11.549 --> 28:13.714
that's what they say, right.

28:15.173 --> 28:17.173
Got three or four hours.

29:03.913 --> 29:06.579
- I'd like to thank Dean for
the wonderful neknomination,

29:06.621 --> 29:08.578
you know, I
appreciate it so much.

29:08.620 --> 29:12.120
I'm gonna go ahead
and pour myself...

29:12.162 --> 29:12.953
One.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.536
Two.

29:15.577 --> 29:16.911
And here we go.

29:16.953 --> 29:18.369
I think this is a bit more
than what you did, Dean.

29:18.410 --> 29:19.410
Three shots.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.285
So, let's get this
party started,

29:22.327 --> 29:24.034
if you know what I mean!

29:24.076 --> 29:26.617
So, here we go, doin'
the neknomination video

29:26.659 --> 29:27.824
like everyone's lovin' to do,

29:27.866 --> 29:30.616
and we got a garbage shot!

29:30.658 --> 29:33.074
Argh, we got a recycling shot!

29:34.491 --> 29:36.990
Ooh, and we got a compost shot!

29:42.696 --> 29:43.947
Thank you for the
neknomination again.

29:43.988 --> 29:47.113
I'd like to neknominate
Greg Wasylyszn,

29:48.862 --> 29:51.820
and Jordan Kerr, you
guys got 24 hours.

29:51.862 --> 29:52.653
Do it up.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.308
Afterburners go!

30:57.474 --> 30:59.140
Oh fuck.

30:59.182 --> 31:01.556
- So, I've been
goin' over our list

31:01.598 --> 31:04.389
of potential destinations.
- Right.

31:06.889 --> 31:10.013
- Yeah, I went ahead and
took Kiev off of that list.

31:10.055 --> 31:13.179
- Oh, okay.

31:13.221 --> 31:17.012
- I hear it's nice,
just not right now.

31:17.054 --> 31:20.136
- Right, right, I agree, okay.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.385
- Okay, that's solved.

31:23.427 --> 31:25.344
- It's all good though, man,

31:25.385 --> 31:27.509
I just got blown
out of my plane.

31:27.550 --> 31:28.800
I'm parachuting down now.

31:28.842 --> 31:31.218
I think I'm gonna be
up here for awhile.

31:31.259 --> 31:32.841
Ooo, check this out!

31:35.716 --> 31:38.424
Rasta!

31:38.466 --> 31:39.382
- Very nice!

31:39.424 --> 31:40.507
- Right!

31:40.548 --> 31:41.548
- I like that a lot.

31:41.590 --> 31:42.923
- I think I got the order right.

31:42.964 --> 31:44.506
- I may screen cap that even,

31:44.547 --> 31:46.131
and set it as my background.

31:46.173 --> 31:48.505
- I'll try and get it straight.

31:48.546 --> 31:51.130
- I was at work the other day,

31:51.172 --> 31:54.296
and I borrowed my
friends Rubik's cube,

31:55.421 --> 31:57.503
and I did a side.
- Really?

31:58.378 --> 31:59.628
- I did a whole top side, yeah.

31:59.669 --> 32:02.585
So, I did what you, I
followed your basic,

32:02.627 --> 32:04.627
like your teachings.

32:04.668 --> 32:06.710
So, I started with, like
I figured out the thingies

32:06.752 --> 32:08.376
in the middle, what
do you call those?

32:08.418 --> 32:10.126
- The center pieces?
- The core.

32:10.168 --> 32:11.501
- Yeah, they're locked in.

32:11.542 --> 32:12.958
- Oh, they're locked in.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.500
- Yeah, those ones don't
move no matter what.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.833
- Yeah, so those
ones are locked in,

32:15.875 --> 32:17.416
and so I went off of that one,

32:17.458 --> 32:21.374
and I went with yellow
as what I was going for

32:21.416 --> 32:23.457
for my top one.
- Right.

32:23.498 --> 32:26.415
- And using your
handy algorithms.

32:26.457 --> 32:28.497
- Yep, yeah.
- Got me a top.

32:28.538 --> 32:30.122
- You got a full side completed?

32:30.164 --> 32:31.954
- A full side, well, I
guess it could be any side.

32:31.996 --> 32:33.330
It's not necessarily
the top, right.

32:33.371 --> 32:35.496
- Right.
- It's top now, bottom.

32:35.537 --> 32:36.870
- Switch it over,
it's all relative.

32:36.912 --> 32:40.703
- Yeah, so, but then I
tried doing a second row,

32:42.411 --> 32:45.785
like a second side and it
really screwed everything up.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.327
- Well, that's what
algorithms are for,

32:50.368 --> 32:51.493
so that you can, you know.

32:51.534 --> 32:54.742
- But that's infuriating
and I hate it,

32:54.783 --> 32:56.533
so I'm gonna have to keep
trying is what I'm saying.

32:56.574 --> 33:00.116
I gave it a lot of
paid work hours,

33:00.158 --> 33:02.032
but I'm gonna solve it--

33:02.073 --> 33:03.282
- Well, then you got it at work.

33:03.324 --> 33:04.531
Is it just at work still?

33:04.573 --> 33:06.073
- It's at work, it's on my desk.

33:06.115 --> 33:08.031
It's under like a bunch of
papers that look like real work.

33:08.072 --> 33:09.489
- And you wanna get
the whole thing done?

33:09.530 --> 33:11.239
- Oh, I'm gonna get the
whole thing done, for sure.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.863
- It's not easy to get
the whole thing done.

33:12.905 --> 33:15.238
- There's like 12 year olds
on YouTube who have done it.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.904
- But if you know the
algorithms you can do it, yeah.

33:18.945 --> 33:20.862
- One, two, three, four.

33:20.904 --> 33:22.445
- Yep.

33:22.486 --> 33:23.986
- One, one, one, one.

33:24.028 --> 33:25.569
- Yep.

33:25.611 --> 33:27.610
- Zero, zero, zero, zero.

33:27.651 --> 33:29.319
- Yep.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.110
- Seven, seven, seven, seven.

33:31.152 --> 33:32.692
- Yep.

33:32.734 --> 33:34.484
- Zero, zero, zero, zero.

33:34.525 --> 33:36.026
- Yep.

33:36.067 --> 33:37.774
- Four, four, four, four.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.400
- Yep.

33:39.442 --> 33:41.066
- Two, two, two, two.

33:41.108 --> 33:42.316
- Yep.

33:43.565 --> 33:46.772
- 69, 69.

33:46.814 --> 33:49.481
- Yep, of course.

33:49.522 --> 33:51.688
- Nine, nine, nine, nine.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.521
- Yep.

33:53.563 --> 33:55.480
- Three, three, three, three.

33:55.521 --> 33:56.354
- Yep.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.438
- Five, five, five, five.

33:59.479 --> 34:00.271
- Yep.

34:01.644 --> 34:04.728
- Six, six, six, six.

34:04.769 --> 34:06.560
- Number of the beast.

34:07.477 --> 34:08.268
Yep.

34:09.685 --> 34:11.601
- Eight, eight, eight, eight.

34:11.641 --> 34:12.476
- Yep.

34:13.641 --> 34:14.766
- Four, three, two, one.

34:14.809 --> 34:16.475
- Got it.

34:16.516 --> 34:18.434
- One, zero, one, zero.

34:18.475 --> 34:19.641
- Yep.

34:22.556 --> 34:24.224
- Might as well try this one.

34:24.266 --> 34:27.223
A bit of a hail Mary, but
it's the least common.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.431
Eight, zero, six, eight.

34:29.473 --> 34:31.513
- Got it.

34:31.554 --> 34:33.597
That's all the ones
they mentioned?

34:33.638 --> 34:35.139
- That's all of them.

34:35.181 --> 34:36.721
- Okay.

34:36.762 --> 34:38.346
Man, people are lazy.

34:38.388 --> 34:41.012
There's so many of
them here that are,

34:41.053 --> 34:44.844
they're just typin' the
same shit over and over.

34:45.928 --> 34:47.219
Well, whatever.

35:16.297 --> 35:18.422
- The further you research,

35:18.463 --> 35:21.753
the deeper that you
investigate how it is

35:21.795 --> 35:24.045
that we feel that
we live our lives,

35:24.087 --> 35:28.086
the more you begin to understand
that we've been deceived.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.751
We've had the wool
pulled over our eyes

35:32.793 --> 35:34.877
by every institution.

35:34.918 --> 35:37.500
So, why would our
religious organizations

35:37.542 --> 35:39.500
be any damn different?

35:39.542 --> 35:42.041
What is it about the
church that makes them

35:42.083 --> 35:44.417
immune to corruption?

35:44.458 --> 35:47.707
In fact, I'd argue
that our religious--

35:47.748 --> 35:48.540
- Aaron?

35:49.623 --> 35:50.706
- Yeah.

35:52.539 --> 35:56.164
- Did you use my booze
for your neknomination?

35:57.913 --> 36:00.247
- The booze in the
cabinet above the fridge?

36:00.289 --> 36:02.745
- Yeah, my booze in the cabinet.

36:02.787 --> 36:05.495
- Yes, I think that
is what I used.

36:07.744 --> 36:09.370
- Okay, um, that's cool.

36:09.412 --> 36:13.411
Next time, just like ask
if you wanna use my stuff.

36:14.618 --> 36:16.326
- Yeah, no that's no problem.

36:16.368 --> 36:17.492
I will do that.

36:18.492 --> 36:20.658
- Your recycle shot doe!

36:20.700 --> 36:22.658
- Compost shot!

36:23.741 --> 36:25.490
Garbage shot!

36:25.532 --> 36:27.366
Recycling shot!

36:27.408 --> 36:29.824
- Institutions are perhaps by far

36:29.866 --> 36:33.489
the most morally corroded
and ethically bankrupt

36:33.531 --> 36:36.488
systems of them all
because they are...

37:24.813 --> 37:26.645
- So, I'm sittin' at
this New York fries,

37:26.687 --> 37:30.395
waiting to order and I
realized that Michael Bublé

37:30.436 --> 37:32.353
is playing on the radio,

37:32.395 --> 37:34.436
and I think Michael Bublé
is a Canadian champ.

37:34.477 --> 37:36.102
I don't think we hear
enough of Michael Bublé,

37:36.144 --> 37:38.269
so I was pretty happy about it,

37:38.310 --> 37:39.601
and by the time I got up there,

37:39.643 --> 37:41.434
Michael Bublé was still playing,

37:41.475 --> 37:43.892
so I tell the guy
who's serving me, I go,

37:43.934 --> 37:45.558
"Hey, Michael Bublé is
pretty great, right?"

37:45.599 --> 37:47.516
He's like, "Yeah, yeah,
I love Michael Bublé.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.308
"He reminds me of Frank."

37:49.350 --> 37:50.849
And I go, "Who?"

37:50.890 --> 37:52.432
And he goes, "Frank Sinatra,
you know Frank Sinatra?"

37:52.473 --> 37:55.014
And I go, "Yeah, but have
you met Frank Sinatra?"

37:55.056 --> 37:56.806
He goes, "No."

37:56.848 --> 37:58.306
I'm like, "Do you know his
son, Frank Sinatra Jr.?"

37:58.348 --> 37:59.472
He goes, "No," and I'm like,

37:59.514 --> 38:01.596
"Then you can't
really call 'em Frank.

38:01.638 --> 38:03.430
"You're not his buddy,
you're not friends with him."

38:03.471 --> 38:05.429
And the guy just sort of
just gives me a weird look,

38:05.470 --> 38:06.512
give me my fries, and goes like,

38:06.554 --> 38:09.096
"Okay man, have a good day."

38:09.138 --> 38:11.303
So, I'm on the bus with
my fries eating away,

38:11.345 --> 38:13.636
and this sort of bigger
woman accidentally

38:13.678 --> 38:17.302
knocks my arm, and I drop
my fries on the ground.

38:17.344 --> 38:19.427
And I'm like, "Fuck, my fries."

38:19.468 --> 38:20.759
So, I'm looking at
them on the ground,

38:20.801 --> 38:22.426
and I don't know what to
do in this situation.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.551
Do I pick up the fries?

38:23.592 --> 38:25.092
Do I carry around
dirty fries with me?

38:25.134 --> 38:27.175
I'm not gonna eat 'em anymore.

38:27.217 --> 38:30.133
And obviously, there's a
guy sitting across the bar,

38:30.174 --> 38:33.091
sorry, not the bar, the bus,

38:33.133 --> 38:34.840
and he's looking at me.

38:34.881 --> 38:36.673
He sees me lookin' at
the fries, and he goes,

38:36.714 --> 38:39.048
"Hey man, you gonna
pick up your fries?"

38:39.090 --> 38:41.339
I go, "I don't know what
to do in this situation?

38:41.381 --> 38:43.047
"Do I pick up he
fries? Do I not?"

38:43.089 --> 38:44.422
He goes, "I don't
care what you do!

38:44.463 --> 38:46.338
"Just pick up your fries!

38:46.380 --> 38:48.421
"your dirtying up
everyone's area."

38:48.462 --> 38:50.420
So it's like, "Maybe I
won't pick up my fries now.

38:50.461 --> 38:51.586
"You're being a little rude."

38:51.628 --> 38:53.545
And so we sort of
have a back and forth,

38:53.586 --> 38:55.128
and I ended up kicking
the fries towards him

38:55.169 --> 38:56.419
to be passive aggressive.

38:56.460 --> 38:58.044
Anyways, I made it
off the bus just fine

38:58.086 --> 39:00.293
without having to
pick up the fries.

39:00.335 --> 39:01.960
I'm walking along, go to work,

39:02.001 --> 39:03.709
which I work from home,

39:05.583 --> 39:07.792
and I see this black truck
parked on the side of the road.

39:07.834 --> 39:09.417
There's this guy sittin' in it,

39:09.458 --> 39:12.041
he looks at me, I look at
him, and he goes, "Faggot."

39:12.083 --> 39:13.416
- What?

39:13.457 --> 39:14.873
- I was like,
"Okay man, thanks,"

39:14.915 --> 39:16.706
and just kept walkin' along.

39:16.748 --> 39:18.915
Next day I'm on the bus
listening to Michael Bublé

39:18.957 --> 39:20.289
because of the day before.

39:20.331 --> 39:21.289
I'm listenin' and
I'm rockin' out

39:21.331 --> 39:22.539
a little too loud on the bus,

39:22.580 --> 39:25.080
and this woman taps me
on the shoulder, goes,

39:25.122 --> 39:26.413
"Yeah, can you turn
down your music?"

39:26.454 --> 39:27.955
I go, "Yeah," and she goes,

39:27.996 --> 39:29.912
"But Michael Bublé
is pretty good."

39:29.954 --> 39:31.329
I go, "Yeah, he's
great," she goes,

39:31.371 --> 39:33.121
"Yeah, he reminds me of Frank."

39:33.162 --> 39:34.911
I go, "Frank who?"

39:34.953 --> 39:36.702
Because I don't
remember the day before.

39:36.744 --> 39:39.036
She goes, "You know,
Frank Sinatra."

39:39.078 --> 39:40.701
I'm like, "Do you
know Frank Sinatra?"

39:40.743 --> 39:41.993
She's like, "No."

39:42.035 --> 39:44.119
"Do you know his son,
Frank Sinatra Jr.?"

39:44.160 --> 39:47.826
She's like, "No, I don't
know him either" and I go,

39:47.867 --> 39:49.243
"Then you can't
really call 'em Frank.

39:49.284 --> 39:50.783
"You're not buddies with him.

39:50.825 --> 39:52.283
"You're not friends, you
don't know him personally."

39:52.325 --> 39:53.866
She's like, "Okay, man."

39:53.908 --> 39:56.532
So, I put my headphones back
in and I keep jamming out.

39:56.573 --> 39:58.532
Later that day, I'm back
on the bus, I sit down,

39:58.573 --> 40:01.240
and I realize, boom,
fries are on the ground.

40:01.281 --> 40:02.406
These aren't mine though,

40:02.447 --> 40:03.572
these are the different
types of fries,

40:03.614 --> 40:05.072
I don't know who spilt these.

40:05.114 --> 40:06.696
I'm staring at them.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.904
Anyways, someone gets on the
bus, looks at me, and goes,

40:09.946 --> 40:11.737
"You gonna pick up those fries?"

40:11.779 --> 40:15.486
Same thing happens, except
this time I didn't drop them,

40:15.528 --> 40:17.320
so I was very
defensive about it.

40:17.362 --> 40:18.778
I was like, "They're not mine."

40:18.820 --> 40:20.319
- Rightfully so.

40:20.361 --> 40:22.693
- Got off the bus, low and
behold, black truck zooms by me,

40:22.735 --> 40:24.442
"Hey, remember me, faggot?"

40:24.484 --> 40:26.151
He yells out the window.
- What?

40:26.193 --> 40:28.943
- I'm like, come on.

40:28.984 --> 40:31.525
So, the next day,
I'm on the bus again,

40:31.566 --> 40:35.399
I got fries, I'm eating them,
but I am safe as can be,

40:35.440 --> 40:37.024
you know what I mean,

40:37.066 --> 40:39.564
it really shows my dedication
to french fries.

40:39.606 --> 40:42.439
So, I get off the bus,
and I've successfully

40:42.481 --> 40:43.898
made it through a bus
ride without having

40:43.940 --> 40:45.814
spilled fries around me.

40:45.855 --> 40:48.522
And I'm walking along
all proud, and you know,

40:48.563 --> 40:51.437
little do I know, black
truck zooms by me, "Faggot!"

40:51.479 --> 40:53.896
I'm startled, I drop
my fries everywhere,

40:53.938 --> 40:55.561
I'm staring at them
on the ground going,

40:55.603 --> 40:57.978
"Oh my God, not again."

40:58.020 --> 41:01.061
And I look up, and
I see these people

41:01.103 --> 41:03.644
staring at me from their porch.

41:03.685 --> 41:04.976
And I'm looking at the fries,

41:05.018 --> 41:06.227
and they're looking
at me, and they go,

41:06.268 --> 41:08.018
"Hey, you gonna
pick up your fries?"

41:08.060 --> 41:09.351
I was just like, "Yeah."

41:09.392 --> 41:11.392
So, I pick 'em up,
I throw 'em out.

41:11.433 --> 41:14.474
Anyways, I'm talking to Greg
on the phone the next day,

41:14.516 --> 41:16.016
and I'm telling him
all this weird stuff,

41:16.058 --> 41:17.266
and I go, it reminded me of like

41:17.308 --> 41:18.766
a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode.

41:18.808 --> 41:21.556
I felt like Larry going
through all these weird things.

41:21.598 --> 41:24.056
He goes, "Larry who?"

41:24.098 --> 41:25.472
I go, "You know, Larry
David, the main character

41:25.514 --> 41:26.764
"on Curb Your Enthusiasm."

41:26.806 --> 41:28.888
He goes, "Do you
know Larry David?"

41:28.930 --> 41:29.805
I'm like, "No," and he's like,

41:29.846 --> 41:31.805
"How can you say that?

41:31.846 --> 41:33.596
"You don't know him,
he's not your friend."

41:33.638 --> 41:36.470
And I'm like, "Anyways,
it was a weird weekend."

42:16.545 --> 42:19.586
- I couldn't take out any money.

42:19.628 --> 42:20.878
I tried like three times,

42:20.920 --> 42:24.211
I think the machine is
broken or somethin',

42:24.252 --> 42:27.127
but I don't have any
cash for tonight.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.502
I don't know if maybe you could.

42:28.542 --> 42:30.542
- Ah, yeah, no problem, man.
- Sorry.

42:30.584 --> 42:33.501
I used the cash I did
have for the coat check.

42:33.541 --> 42:35.833
It was just, it would just load,

42:35.875 --> 42:37.833
and wouldn't--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:37.875 --> 42:40.832
- It spit the card
back out each time.

42:40.874 --> 42:42.166
Appreciate it, thanks.

42:42.208 --> 42:44.998
- It's been a good
month, you know,.

42:47.165 --> 42:49.247
- How much of a tip was that?

42:49.289 --> 42:50.872
- It doesn't matter.

43:28.489 --> 43:29.405
Hey man.
- Yo.

43:44.153 --> 43:44.903
- Yep.

43:44.944 --> 43:46.361
- Sorry.

43:47.444 --> 43:48.777
- That's alright.

44:05.565 --> 44:09.397
- Listen, sort of the reason
I came down here, I mean,

44:09.439 --> 44:12.856
other than to hang
out, have a good time,

44:12.898 --> 44:15.563
you know, buy you
a couple beers.

44:15.605 --> 44:19.645
How do you feel about
making an extra...

44:19.687 --> 44:21.313
2 to $3,000 a month?

44:22.687 --> 44:27.519
- Sure, I mean--
- Listen, listen.

44:27.561 --> 44:29.977
I've been working with
this organization,

44:30.019 --> 44:32.393
and it's been a little
over a month now.

44:32.435 --> 44:34.351
And we're expanding,
and that really speaks

44:34.392 --> 44:36.143
to the success of the company,

44:36.185 --> 44:39.059
and I wanna include
you in that expansion.

44:39.100 --> 44:40.975
Now, you're a hard
worker, you know,

44:41.017 --> 44:41.892
you're very personable, I mean,

44:41.933 --> 44:43.183
we've been friends for forever,

44:43.224 --> 44:44.724
you're great with numbers,

44:44.766 --> 44:46.849
those are the kind of traits
that we're looking for.

44:46.891 --> 44:48.723
Alright, and you're probably
asking yourself right now,

44:48.765 --> 44:50.389
"What does he do?"

44:50.431 --> 44:53.513
Well, I just follow other
people's directions,

44:53.555 --> 44:55.139
and I work hard,
and I get to do it

44:55.181 --> 44:58.512
from the comfort of my own
couch, I work from home.

44:58.554 --> 45:01.554
You know, I got a suit
and tie, but you know,

45:01.596 --> 45:03.595
when am I gonna wear
it, right, right?

45:03.636 --> 45:05.678
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:05.720 --> 45:10.261
- So, that $2,000, that's
not the cap, alright,

45:10.303 --> 45:12.760
the amount of money that
you make out of this

45:12.801 --> 45:14.260
is based off of
the amount of work

45:14.302 --> 45:15.801
that you're willing
to put into it.

45:15.843 --> 45:19.759
I know people who started
making two, three grand a month,

45:19.800 --> 45:21.342
now they're making
ten grand a month,

45:21.383 --> 45:23.591
and some people would
consider that a bad month.

45:23.632 --> 45:26.175
So, if you wanna work hard,
you're gonna make buck,

45:26.216 --> 45:27.590
but if you wanna take it easy,

45:27.631 --> 45:29.340
take a week off, you
know, and a supervisor

45:29.381 --> 45:31.882
breathing down your neck
telling you to get back to work.

45:31.923 --> 45:35.214
It's a great opportunity,
and I thought, you know,

45:35.256 --> 45:36.756
what kind of friend would I be

45:36.797 --> 45:40.297
if I didn't come down
here and pitch it to you?

45:40.338 --> 45:41.921
So, what do you say?

45:42.962 --> 45:44.754
You wanna work together?

45:46.296 --> 45:47.378
- Well, like...

45:49.586 --> 45:50.377
What is...

45:51.502 --> 45:53.418
It kind of sounds like...

45:55.335 --> 45:56.918
Sort of...

45:56.960 --> 45:58.667
What is it that you do?

46:27.536 --> 46:29.953
- Well, that was fun!
- Yeah, yeah.

46:29.995 --> 46:31.536
Good time.

46:31.578 --> 46:33.161
- Definitely gonna have
to do it again some time.

46:33.202 --> 46:34.577
- For sure.
- Yeah.

46:35.744 --> 46:36.368
Alright!

46:38.160 --> 46:39.492
- I'll get the drinks next time.

46:39.534 --> 46:41.160
- Absolutely!

47:42.646 --> 47:43.855
- Yo!

47:46.646 --> 47:48.021
- I got $20 for
internet this month.

47:48.062 --> 47:48.854
- Sweet, thanks.

47:48.895 --> 47:50.312
- Yeah, no problem.

47:50.353 --> 47:52.103
- Oh wait, hey,
were you just doing laundry?

47:52.145 --> 47:53.352
- Yeah, I'm done now though.

47:53.394 --> 47:56.103
- Did you find it in there?

47:57.685 --> 47:59.227
- I did.

47:59.269 --> 48:01.727
- Because I lost
$20 in the laundry room

48:01.768 --> 48:03.934
earlier doing laundry.

48:03.976 --> 48:05.475
- You lost $20 earlier today?

48:05.517 --> 48:06.933
- Yeah.

48:09.641 --> 48:11.267
- Did you check?

48:11.308 --> 48:14.266
- Well, I checked
like after it was all done,

48:14.307 --> 48:15.807
and then I didn't
have it, and then...

48:15.849 --> 48:17.347
- But you figured it
was in the laundry.

48:17.389 --> 48:18.848
- Yeah, I didn't want to interrupt

48:18.889 --> 48:20.140
you doing yours.

48:20.181 --> 48:22.264
- You wouldn't be interrupting.

48:22.305 --> 48:25.930
I mean, yeah, no, I just
figured it was probably mine

48:25.972 --> 48:27.721
because...

48:27.762 --> 48:29.013
If I had thought--

48:29.054 --> 48:30.721
- I guess I thought it fell out

48:30.762 --> 48:32.178
of my pocket maybe
during the whole cycle.

48:32.220 --> 48:33.220
- Mmm-hmm...

48:35.636 --> 48:36.386
- Well--

48:36.428 --> 48:37.677
- I mean, I...

48:37.719 --> 48:38.885
- Either way, I'll take it.

48:38.927 --> 48:41.261
- Yeah, I did find it though.

48:42.384 --> 48:45.135
So, I'm thinking maybe
just based on that

48:45.176 --> 48:47.341
we'll say it's for internet.

48:49.508 --> 48:53.133
- Well, do you wanna check again?

48:54.507 --> 48:55.924
- For another $20?

48:59.007 --> 49:01.755
Yeah, yeah, I can do that, okay.

49:01.797 --> 49:03.006
- It's possible.

49:03.047 --> 49:06.214
- Yeah, yeah, maybe
yours is still in there.

49:08.046 --> 49:08.838
If, okay.

49:42.414 --> 49:44.664
- So, I was reading up, and like,

49:44.706 --> 49:47.997
the main things, there's
basically five main things

49:48.038 --> 49:51.370
that you need to
know about them.

49:51.412 --> 49:54.745
So, like number one is
that they were al Qaeda,

49:54.787 --> 49:58.327
like before, when we went
in, they were al Qaeda

49:58.369 --> 50:01.827
like for the first war,
even the one before Bush,

50:01.868 --> 50:04.785
it was still al Qaeda, but
then, just after we withdrew,

50:04.827 --> 50:07.701
then they became who they
are now, which is ISIS.

50:07.742 --> 50:10.367
So, it's like, we kind
of created them because

50:10.409 --> 50:14.825
thing number two is like
now because we're waging

50:14.866 --> 50:19.282
like this war just from
the air with drones,

50:19.323 --> 50:22.322
it's like they can
still move about,

50:22.364 --> 50:24.322
or get out of the areas
that we're bombing,

50:24.364 --> 50:27.280
but they're going to
more sovereign countries,

50:27.321 --> 50:29.947
so it's like they're
going to more

50:29.989 --> 50:32.487
sovereign countries
that we can't bomb,

50:32.529 --> 50:34.196
so it's actually
making matters worse

50:34.238 --> 50:35.654
that we're just
doing it via drones.

50:35.696 --> 50:36.987
- It's not even connected.

50:37.028 --> 50:39.736
I would think you'd
have to hit TV.

50:41.194 --> 50:43.777
- So, anyway,
thing number three

50:43.819 --> 50:47.401
is that because of UN
regulations we had to leave

50:47.442 --> 50:50.651
and because Obama's there,
like Obama is in power,

50:50.693 --> 50:53.817
and his big thing was that
we're gonna get out, so we did,

50:53.858 --> 50:55.275
but then we had the next attack,

50:55.316 --> 50:57.399
so we had to stay in.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.399
So, it's just like
perpetuating the war,

50:59.440 --> 51:01.190
but like it's making it
worse that we're still there

51:01.232 --> 51:02.856
and bombing it, but anyway,

51:02.898 --> 51:04.773
do you know how to
work this, Aaron?

51:04.815 --> 51:06.106
- No, I do not.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.022
- You wanna fix this?

51:09.064 --> 51:10.938
- There's a quick remote setup.

51:10.980 --> 51:13.146
- Anyway, thing number five.

51:26.768 --> 51:27.518
- Ahh!

51:27.559 --> 51:28.309
- Sorry!

51:28.351 --> 51:29.185
Sorry!

51:32.767 --> 51:33.558
Sorry.

52:01.719 --> 52:02.719
- Alright, it's you.

52:02.761 --> 52:03.636
- It's impressive though

52:03.678 --> 52:04.886
that you can do both at once.

52:04.928 --> 52:06.718
- Thank you.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.426
- So, basically,
all of those things combined

52:08.468 --> 52:10.509
it's like we can't get out
of this fucking forever war--

52:10.550 --> 52:13.093
- Are you sure you
don't wanna come, Aaron?

52:13.134 --> 52:16.050
- I am sure, thank
you, that's okay.

52:16.092 --> 52:19.841
- Why not,
it'll be so much fun.

52:19.883 --> 52:23.715
- I'm not much of a going
out to dance person.

52:23.757 --> 52:25.340
- I think you were under the impression

52:25.381 --> 52:28.714
that we were drinking when
really we were just pre-drinking

52:28.756 --> 52:31.380
to go drink at the place.

52:31.421 --> 52:33.338
- I was just drinking.

52:33.380 --> 52:36.462
- It's gonna be
really fun, I swear.

52:36.504 --> 52:38.796
- I'm sure it will, but I'm--

52:38.837 --> 52:39.796
- So come!

52:39.837 --> 52:41.087
- I'm gonna stay in.

52:41.128 --> 52:42.253
- It's only five bucks.

52:42.294 --> 52:43.628
- Yeah, that's super cheap.

52:43.670 --> 52:46.418
- It's five bucks I could
spend on several beers

52:46.460 --> 52:49.086
if I'm getting something
from the store, right.

52:49.127 --> 52:50.751
- Yeah, at the bar.

52:50.793 --> 52:52.085
- Okay now, dude, seriously,

52:52.126 --> 52:54.626
come on, get your
shoes on, let's go!

52:54.668 --> 52:56.084
- No, I'm staying.

52:56.125 --> 52:59.042
Thank you though,
but I am good here.

53:00.457 --> 53:02.374
- Dude!
Seriously, I'm not jokin'.

53:02.415 --> 53:06.165
- I'm serious, I am,
no, I'm good, thank you.

53:08.040 --> 53:10.664
- Don't be lame, come on.

53:10.705 --> 53:14.081
- Sorry, I'm being
lame, but this is--

53:14.122 --> 53:16.038
- Okay, no,
Aaron's gonna be lame!

53:16.080 --> 53:17.038
Let's roll!

53:17.080 --> 53:18.163
We'll have fun!

53:18.205 --> 53:19.371
- Bye Aaron.

53:19.412 --> 53:22.079
- Yeah, no have
fun, yep, thank you.

53:22.120 --> 53:22.912
Good bye.

54:56.601 --> 54:58.517
- So, we got to
Sneaks, and like,

54:58.559 --> 55:00.059
right off the bat,
Adrian was like,

55:00.100 --> 55:04.350
"This is gonna be a serious
evening of craziness."

55:04.391 --> 55:06.058
So, he went to the
bar, and he's like,

55:06.099 --> 55:07.390
"I want three Jäger
bombs right away,

55:07.432 --> 55:09.349
and like he's a huge
lightweight, like,

55:09.390 --> 55:11.306
whenever I tell him
that he's a lightweight,

55:11.348 --> 55:12.765
he gets really
pissy, so I was like,

55:12.806 --> 55:15.014
"Tonight, I'm gonna
let him do his thing.

55:15.056 --> 55:17.722
"He's a big shot now."

55:17.764 --> 55:21.638
And so, he gets his three shots,

55:21.679 --> 55:23.804
and we're on the dance
floor, it's great,

55:23.846 --> 55:25.762
we're all having fun,
and then I lose him,

55:25.803 --> 55:28.220
and like 20 minutes later
I find him at the bar,

55:28.261 --> 55:31.886
and he has like five
or six empty shots,

55:31.928 --> 55:33.844
which I'm assuming
were all Jäger bombs.

55:33.886 --> 55:35.635
And I think by the
end of the night,

55:35.676 --> 55:39.467
all total, he had like
ten freakin' Jäger bombs,

55:40.634 --> 55:43.967
so like, big night for Adrian.

55:44.009 --> 55:45.799
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

55:56.006 --> 55:58.881
If you like to get
high from joints,

55:58.923 --> 56:01.588
you are gonna love
smoking a bong.

56:01.630 --> 56:09.836
So, you'll just, I think
I've got a lighter in here.

56:09.878 --> 56:13.170
Take the lighter, go
ahead and smoke the weed.

56:13.211 --> 56:15.668
You'll be inhaling
the entire time,

56:15.710 --> 56:18.543
so you'll just have your
mouth fully sealed on this,

56:18.585 --> 56:21.584
you'll take the lighter,
light it whilst inhaling,

56:21.626 --> 56:23.168
there'll be a sort
of bubbling sound.

56:23.209 --> 56:24.791
- Okay.

56:24.833 --> 56:28.208
- The smoke will go through,
fill the chamber, the shaft.

56:28.249 --> 56:31.373
And once you either
can't inhale any longer,

56:31.415 --> 56:34.748
or once it has run out,
you will pull the bowl out,

56:34.789 --> 56:37.206
and then the smoke
will then, shoop,

56:37.247 --> 56:38.956
shoot into your lungs.

56:38.998 --> 56:40.288
I guess, just you know, science,

56:40.330 --> 56:42.330
oxygen can now enter
from another point,

56:42.371 --> 56:44.871
and it just completes
the loop, right.

56:44.913 --> 56:46.204
- Sure, yeah.

56:46.245 --> 56:48.038
- So, I can show you
first if you want.

56:48.079 --> 56:50.578
This is what I
meant by inhaling.

56:52.453 --> 56:56.202
Get the bubbles goin',
right, that's a good noise.

56:56.243 --> 56:59.035
Nice music by the way.
- Thank you.

56:59.076 --> 57:01.118
- Let's, I can go first.
- Yeah, please.

57:01.160 --> 57:03.326
Please, please, please.

57:03.367 --> 57:07.742
- Yeah, okay, so again,
light, inhale, pull, inhale,

57:07.783 --> 57:10.866
hold it in, exhale, you've
smoked before, yeah?

57:10.908 --> 57:12.532
- Okay.
- Alright.

57:25.237 --> 57:26.613
Voila!

57:26.654 --> 57:30.112
And then, exhale.

57:30.154 --> 57:32.528
And soon enough, I will be high.

57:32.570 --> 57:33.944
- Way to go.

57:33.986 --> 57:35.235
- I can pack you a bowl now.

57:35.277 --> 57:36.485
- Yeah!

57:36.527 --> 57:39.068
- Do a similar size.
- Yeah.

57:39.110 --> 57:40.568
- You could do more
if you wanted to.

57:40.610 --> 57:42.651
- No, I don't think so.

58:17.728 --> 58:19.185
- You out?

58:19.226 --> 58:20.226
- Yeah.

58:21.602 --> 58:22.226
- Cool.

59:26.255 --> 59:28.671
- Hello sweetheart,
it's the mother.

59:28.713 --> 59:32.880
Could you call me please as
soon as you get this message?

59:32.921 --> 59:36.712
I've received about three
phone calls from the bank,

59:36.753 --> 59:39.003
and the one this morning,

59:39.044 --> 59:42.419
the guy who left a
message said it is urgent

59:45.002 --> 59:46.918
that you call the bank.

59:49.208 --> 59:52.542
So, if you could,
well, do two things,

59:52.584 --> 59:54.708
if you could call your bank,

59:54.749 --> 59:57.374
and also call me
back to let me know

59:57.416 --> 59:59.915
that you've done this
and to reassure--

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:05.622
I'm just a little bit concerned.

01:00:05.664 --> 01:00:07.664
Love you to bits, bye-bye.

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:10.621
- End of--

01:00:10.663 --> 01:00:11.538
Message deleted.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.287
Saved message, sent on.

01:00:33.449 --> 01:00:35.408
- The architecture
in Germany here

01:00:35.449 --> 01:00:38.032
is all really modern because
they had to rebuild everything

01:00:38.074 --> 01:00:42.282
after World War II because
it all got destroyed.

01:00:42.323 --> 01:00:44.865
They also have really
awesome looking castles

01:00:44.906 --> 01:00:46.531
in the German countryside.

01:00:46.573 --> 01:00:50.114
Plus, it's on my bucket list
to drink a beer in Germany,

01:00:50.196 --> 01:00:52.114
and it has to be out of a boot.

01:00:52.155 --> 01:00:53.237
That's how it's done.

01:00:53.279 --> 01:00:55.195
And if that's on
the bucket list,

01:00:55.237 --> 01:00:57.320
then smoking a
joint in Amsterdam

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:00.028
is also on the bucket list.

01:01:00.070 --> 01:01:02.444
Maybe, if there's time,
swing out far enough east

01:01:02.486 --> 01:01:04.610
into Turkey to see Istanbul

01:01:05.819 --> 01:01:07.277
because it's like the
only city in the world

01:01:07.318 --> 01:01:09.943
that I know of that
is in two continents,

01:01:09.985 --> 01:01:12.151
and that's pretty cool.

01:01:12.192 --> 01:01:14.608
Make my way back, if
there's time again,

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:16.608
maybe go to Switzerland
because I know

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.232
that's sort of like in
the middle of the Alps.

01:01:19.274 --> 01:01:23.606
So, I don't know if there would
be time to go through there.

01:01:23.648 --> 01:01:26.773
Go down to the Italian
countryside, you know,

01:01:26.815 --> 01:01:28.814
see a lot of like
the old villages.

01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:30.814
There's like old Roman
ruins that you can see

01:01:30.856 --> 01:01:33.021
that I'd love to see.

01:01:33.063 --> 01:01:35.354
I would drink a
whole bunch of wine.

01:01:35.396 --> 01:01:37.063
Eventually you get into Rome,

01:01:37.105 --> 01:01:39.228
and you spend a
couple days in Rome

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.145
doing like the Rome stuff,

01:01:41.186 --> 01:01:44.185
like see the Colosseum
and all that.

01:01:46.144 --> 01:01:50.143
You know, maybe go into
Scandinavia, Sweden,

01:01:50.184 --> 01:01:53.142
see some of the
old Viking heritage

01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:57.101
because that show
was pretty awesome.

01:01:57.142 --> 01:01:59.724
Taking the tunnel
over to England,

01:02:01.432 --> 01:02:03.181
and then sort of the way
the trip started off dude,

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.015
with all the touristy
stuff in Paris,

01:02:05.057 --> 01:02:06.682
and sort of cap it off
doing all the touristy

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.973
stuff in London.

01:02:09.014 --> 01:02:12.139
Maybe see like a soccer,
or football match.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.680
And the Tower of London,
it'd be cool to see.

01:03:38.746 --> 01:03:40.538
- Yep.

01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:44.037
- Can I get Molly's
number off you?

01:03:44.079 --> 01:03:46.120
- Why?

01:03:46.161 --> 01:03:50.036
- Hoping to get Kelly's
information from her.

01:03:50.078 --> 01:03:52.035
- Oh, for real?

01:03:52.077 --> 01:03:54.326
Alright, I'll text it to you.

01:04:07.532 --> 01:04:08.406
You got it?

01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:10.782
- Yeah, I got it.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.653
Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:36.276
So, the reason I brought
you to here today,

01:04:36.318 --> 01:04:40.026
and I got you this coffee
is I've got a proposal.

01:04:40.068 --> 01:04:41.192
- Did you want a coffee?

01:04:41.234 --> 01:04:42.650
Because I mean, like I--

01:04:42.691 --> 01:04:44.900
- Oh, no, no, no, I
like water, it's fine,

01:04:44.942 --> 01:04:46.941
it doesn't matter, yeah.

01:04:46.982 --> 01:04:50.148
I have an idea I wanna
run by you, so...

01:04:51.398 --> 01:04:54.356
Basically, you have
a credit card, yes?

01:04:54.397 --> 01:04:57.271
- Yes.
- Right, okay, perfect.

01:04:57.313 --> 01:05:00.146
So, my idea would be that
you, I would take your credit,

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:02.771
or you would give
me your credit card,

01:05:02.813 --> 01:05:06.229
and with the understanding
that I would then take it,

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:10.478
and go to Ajax or
somewhere, I'll take a bus,

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.268
that's the one thing
actually I would probably

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.894
need you to spring for
the bus ticket to Ajax.

01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:17.684
But of course, only initially.

01:05:17.726 --> 01:05:21.475
And then once I'm in
Ajax I would withdraw

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.642
up to the limit that you have.

01:05:23.683 --> 01:05:25.183
I don't know how much it is,

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:27.516
but I'm sure it's an amount
of significance, right.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:30.474
So, this much I would take
out as like cash advance,

01:05:30.516 --> 01:05:32.431
or whatever sort
of way to do so,

01:05:32.473 --> 01:05:33.681
so that I've got it.

01:05:33.723 --> 01:05:37.097
At which point, say some
point that same day,

01:05:37.138 --> 01:05:39.806
you would come into contact
with your credit card company,

01:05:39.847 --> 01:05:43.846
call them up, and say, "Hi,
I can't find my credit card."

01:05:45.346 --> 01:05:47.512
I've lost it, or maybe it
was stolen, I don't know,

01:05:47.553 --> 01:05:49.762
or maybe I just left it at the
last place I made a purchase.

01:05:49.804 --> 01:05:52.427
Doesn't matter, you just know
you don't have it anymore.

01:05:52.469 --> 01:05:55.011
At this point, they will of
course probably look it up,

01:05:55.053 --> 01:05:57.468
"And, you know what,
we actually have some

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.052
"very recent activity."

01:05:59.093 --> 01:06:02.175
Maybe an hour, who knows
what that time is gonna be.

01:06:02.217 --> 01:06:04.467
"Well, you've spent all
this money? Is this you?

01:06:04.509 --> 01:06:06.716
"This is suspicious, it
doesn't look like, you know,

01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:08.758
"your previous spending
record, and such."

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.841
And you could of course be like,

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.715
"Oh, you know..."

01:06:11.757 --> 01:06:13.965
You wouldn't say this because
then it might be obvious,

01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:15.799
but it's fraudulent
activity is what

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.380
it would come to
the conclusion of,

01:06:17.422 --> 01:06:19.672
and they would probably
cancel your credit card

01:06:19.714 --> 01:06:21.254
and send you a new one.

01:06:21.296 --> 01:06:23.838
Your credit score would be
unaffected, not touched,

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880
it would be all good.

01:06:24.922 --> 01:06:27.004
The only thing is, of course,

01:06:27.046 --> 01:06:30.087
I would still have the
money that I've withdrawn

01:06:30.128 --> 01:06:33.252
with your credit card,
and then upon coming back,

01:06:33.294 --> 01:06:34.961
we could then split that.

01:06:35.003 --> 01:06:38.044
And this is of course, like,
it's not anyone's money

01:06:38.085 --> 01:06:39.919
that we're taking,
it's not your money.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.292
Your money, it's
not money you would

01:06:41.334 --> 01:06:42.959
be spending otherwise, right.

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:44.501
It's not the bank's
money or the card

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.291
because they don't even
really deal with real money.

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:49.833
It's just imaginary money
that they claim to have

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.499
with the assumption that
they're not just gonna have

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.082
to pay it all out
at the same time.

01:06:53.123 --> 01:06:54.540
If they did, they'd be screwed.

01:06:54.582 --> 01:06:57.748
That's why they are technically
always screwing us over,

01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:00.289
and this is just a
way for us to finally

01:07:00.331 --> 01:07:03.622
come out on top and
get the final say,

01:07:03.663 --> 01:07:08.120
and sort of get back at the
credit card companies and such

01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:11.995
because it's, I think
it's a really good idea.

01:07:15.453 --> 01:07:19.077
- So, I'm not really,
I'm not quite sure

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.159
what you're trying to do.

01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:26.825
Like what are you trying
to do with my credit card?

01:07:26.867 --> 01:07:31.199
- With it, it's just to
get us both a good amount--

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.824
- I mean, regardless,
this is illegal,

01:07:34.866 --> 01:07:36.531
so I can't--
- Well...

01:07:57.819 --> 01:07:59.736
Hey Dean, how's it goin'?

01:08:01.735 --> 01:08:04.610
Yeah, yeah, I was callin' you,

01:08:04.651 --> 01:08:08.442
I was wondering if that offer
you made is still available?

01:08:13.191 --> 01:08:16.064
Yeah, sweet, okay,
what do I gotta do?

01:08:16.106 --> 01:08:19.398
Just put me in touch
with someone, and I...

01:08:25.813 --> 01:08:27.520
Oh, a registration fee.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.729
Is there any way
that can be waived?

01:08:37.853 --> 01:08:40.852
Yeah, no, I'll have
to think about it.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.019
I'll, yeah.

01:08:48.893 --> 01:08:50.808
Yeah, yeah, take it easy.

01:11:40.524 --> 01:11:42.024
Hello.

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:45.189
Yo, Greg, guess who
is coming to Europe?

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.355
Yeah, my credit
card just called,

01:11:49.397 --> 01:11:51.480
well, the company right,
and they were like,

01:11:51.522 --> 01:11:52.939
"Hey, your limit's increased."

01:11:52.981 --> 01:11:55.813
So, I am going to use
that increased limit

01:11:55.855 --> 01:11:57.980
to fund my way to Europe.

01:11:59.687 --> 01:12:04.020
Well, yeah, it's
not too important.

01:12:04.061 --> 01:12:05.936
The point is like I can
worry about it later now,

01:12:05.978 --> 01:12:09.518
and in the meantime enjoy
Europe like we wanted to.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.518
I think I'm a valued customer,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.475
and like, I don't
appreciate you saying that.

01:12:14.517 --> 01:12:17.308
But I think you'll value
me as a cohort in Europe.

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:18.976
So, why don't we just
focus on the fact

01:12:19.017 --> 01:12:22.141
that I got to figure out
where to meet you and shit.

01:12:22.182 --> 01:12:23.599
Where are you now?

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:29.597
Layover, that sounds boring.

01:12:29.639 --> 01:12:33.055
It's not my intention to do
anything laying over in Europe.

01:12:33.097 --> 01:12:34.054
You're where?

01:12:35.388 --> 01:12:36.972
Paris?

01:12:37.013 --> 01:12:39.303
Well, Paris is expensive.

01:12:39.345 --> 01:12:41.971
No, I'm flying to Amsterdam.

01:12:43.178 --> 01:12:46.094
But like, Europe's tiny.

01:12:46.136 --> 01:12:49.051
Amsterdam? Why would I not
go anywhere but Amsterdam?

01:12:49.093 --> 01:12:51.010
Of course, I'm
going to Amsterdam.

01:12:51.051 --> 01:12:53.844
It's cheaper, and
it's like, again,

01:12:53.884 --> 01:12:56.801
I can just train to anywhere.

01:12:56.843 --> 01:13:00.174
It's like Paris,
where else is in?

01:13:00.216 --> 01:13:02.216
I don't know where it would
stop.

01:13:02.258 --> 01:13:04.507
It would just probably
go straight to Paris.

01:13:04.549 --> 01:13:06.465
Oh, and Belgium's in
between there, isn't it?

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:10.089
Between, what?

01:13:10.131 --> 01:13:11.589
Exactly, that's what
I'm saying, yeah.

01:13:11.631 --> 01:13:13.006
And that's what they do,

01:13:13.047 --> 01:13:14.505
they just train
from place to place.

01:13:14.547 --> 01:13:16.213
They have like,
they've had 'em set up

01:13:16.255 --> 01:13:19.004
since like medieval times or
whenever trains were invented.

01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:21.087
So, it's like, yeah, no,

01:13:21.129 --> 01:13:24.670
Ontario is fucking
bigger than Europe, man,

01:13:24.712 --> 01:13:26.128
and we hardly even use trains.

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:27.962
We have yet to catch up to them.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.419
We gotta figure out
what we're doin'

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.919
as far as trains go.

01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:34.710
Yo, I think I just found a
dollar in the dryer, awesome.

01:13:34.751 --> 01:13:37.209
Yeah, well, I mean, I'll have
to exchange it for a euro.

01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:38.501
That's the other thing,

01:13:38.543 --> 01:13:39.875
did you exchange like
your money and shit

01:13:39.917 --> 01:13:41.083
like when you were
already there,

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.125
or before you went over?
