00:26.136 --> 00:28.339
I see you all the time at school.

00:28.373 --> 00:31.709
Yeah well, I kinda just
want it to be me and you.

00:33.678 --> 00:35.780
You're different, I like that.

00:35.813 --> 00:38.649
I'm sure you tell all the girls that.

00:38.684 --> 00:41.252
So um, how you feel about me?

00:47.126 --> 00:50.862
We kinda need to go 'cause
I have school tomorrow.

00:50.895 --> 00:52.331
So, what's the rush?

04:12.308 --> 04:13.107
Hey.

04:18.613 --> 04:19.914
Um, cool.

04:55.085 --> 04:55.952
Yo, Bridd.

04:59.856 --> 05:03.260
Charlotte's showing
some sweet side boob.

05:05.996 --> 05:06.797
Yep.

05:10.868 --> 05:12.169
It's all you.

05:12.203 --> 05:14.171
Believe me, I've tried.

05:17.576 --> 05:19.944
You know anything about transverses?

05:19.977 --> 05:21.079
Not much.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.883
Yeah I'm never gettin' that promotion.

05:24.916 --> 05:27.051
Screw it, coffee time.

05:27.085 --> 05:29.287
You really need that promotion, huh?

05:29.320 --> 05:31.456
It doesn't matter.

05:31.490 --> 05:35.627
You know, maybe I will try
a new line on Charlotte.

07:09.959 --> 07:11.127
Hey, Mr. Benson.

07:11.159 --> 07:14.030
Trent, smart trades.

07:14.064 --> 07:15.264
What?

07:15.298 --> 07:18.101
You just earned your own portfolio.

07:19.368 --> 07:20.470
Thanks.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.876
I can't believe I got it.

07:27.612 --> 07:30.080
It's like the best thing ever.

07:30.981 --> 07:33.250
We should go to Vegas.

07:33.283 --> 07:36.521
Let's got to Mexico, spring break, dude.

07:39.690 --> 07:43.428
Um, I'll pay for that.

07:46.364 --> 07:47.832
I can afford it.

07:49.868 --> 07:52.370
I know you had something
to do with my promotion.

07:52.403 --> 07:56.474
I don't know how cause
those trades were impossible.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.245
You don't show anybody.

08:00.279 --> 08:02.715
I've seen you do some
pretty amazing things

08:02.748 --> 08:03.816
when no one's looking.

08:03.849 --> 08:05.885
That's creepy.

08:05.918 --> 08:09.021
Alright, you don't wanna talk about it.

08:09.054 --> 08:10.089
You never do.

08:10.121 --> 08:12.091
I like staying below the radar.

08:12.123 --> 08:15.094
You're delivering mail,
that's practically underground.

08:15.126 --> 08:17.128
Well, you start making waves
and people come looking...

08:17.129 --> 08:19.532
See, that doesn't make any sense.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.034
You're 35, you live with your folks.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.335
No, for the last time
they're in Barbados, okay?

08:23.369 --> 08:25.739
All I'm saying is I don't get it.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.875
I'm like your best friend
and I barely know you.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.142
Just drop it.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.263
Bridd Cole?

08:53.201 --> 08:55.103
Couldn't make me the last stop?

08:55.136 --> 08:57.105
If you will sign here.

09:04.813 --> 09:06.882
This says Joseyln Cole.

09:11.053 --> 09:12.186
That's my mom.

09:13.155 --> 09:14.356
Okay.

09:17.526 --> 09:18.928
She's been dead 20 years.

10:04.175 --> 10:07.946
They really have you in
the dungeon, don't they?

10:07.979 --> 10:12.484
So, this is where all the magic happens.

10:13.919 --> 10:16.153
You've worked here for a while right?

10:16.188 --> 10:17.990
I've been here like three months

10:18.023 --> 10:20.425
and it already feels like a year.

10:20.458 --> 10:24.262
My boss needs a letter opener
and other stuff.

10:25.598 --> 10:26.999
Oh, what about that?

10:27.032 --> 10:28.834
Ah, go ahead.

10:30.568 --> 10:33.506
See me, ah.

10:38.945 --> 10:40.246
You've got kind eyes.

10:40.279 --> 10:41.080
What?

10:41.114 --> 10:42.148
I can tell.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.122
I moved around a lot.

11:23.358 --> 11:26.127
I hang around until I get bored

11:26.161 --> 11:28.297
or someone chases me away.

11:31.132 --> 11:33.202
So no connections?

11:33.234 --> 11:34.570
I'm agile.

11:34.602 --> 11:36.337
I can tell.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.975
Let's talk about you.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.579
I think you talk enough
for the both of us.

11:43.612 --> 11:46.515
Uh uh, I have already kissed you.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.752
What about your family?

11:49.786 --> 11:52.756
Not much to tell.

11:52.789 --> 11:53.990
Out of touch?

11:55.792 --> 11:59.029
My dad took off when I was a toddler.

12:00.297 --> 12:05.735
And my mom died a few
years later after that.

12:08.038 --> 12:10.074
Sorry.

12:10.107 --> 12:11.775
It's okay.

12:11.809 --> 12:13.676
Here, I made this for you.

12:19.449 --> 12:20.318
Here.

12:20.351 --> 12:21.152
Oh!

12:21.184 --> 12:22.386
It's much easier.

12:22.420 --> 12:26.858
Little early in
our relationship for rings.

12:26.891 --> 12:29.361
I guess I will just put it on.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.502
Door to door service.

12:42.573 --> 12:44.609
That's very chivalrous.

13:20.481 --> 13:22.783
Oh, you like it pretty.

13:50.745 --> 13:51.880
Oh, God!

13:53.916 --> 13:55.251
Is that our boss?

13:57.219 --> 13:58.254
Wait a sec.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.803
Take what you want.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.340
Go! Go!

14:17.374 --> 14:18.441
Go!

14:20.944 --> 14:22.712
Who the hell is that?

14:22.746 --> 14:23.547
I don't know!

14:23.579 --> 14:24.480
I don't know!

14:24.513 --> 14:25.848
Oh my God, he was so fast!

14:42.266 --> 14:43.067
Oh, God.

14:45.602 --> 14:46.869
That is the last time I kiss a guy

14:46.870 --> 14:49.440
before a background check.

14:49.474 --> 14:50.841
Who's after us?

14:50.874 --> 14:51.842
After you.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.014
Our boss is dead.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.686
I better still have a job.

15:00.718 --> 15:02.353
That's your priority?

15:02.388 --> 15:03.188
No!

15:04.390 --> 15:07.326
Maybe. I don't know.
I'm freaking out!

15:10.895 --> 15:12.464
Okay, we gotta go.

15:16.168 --> 15:16.969
Trent!

15:25.111 --> 15:26.012
What's up?

15:26.046 --> 15:27.479
Hey, we've been attacked!

15:27.514 --> 15:28.547
Are you okay?

15:28.581 --> 15:29.716
Get over here.

15:32.085 --> 15:34.054
Come on, let's go.

15:34.087 --> 15:35.187
Alright, alright.

16:04.919 --> 16:05.886
Oh, my God.

16:08.390 --> 16:10.925
No, no, no.

16:13.828 --> 16:15.229
Time to go, let's go.

16:52.236 --> 16:53.704
Hi, hi.

16:53.736 --> 16:54.937
My name is Bridd Cole.
I'd like to report an emer...

16:54.938 --> 16:56.240
Are you crazy?

16:56.272 --> 16:57.774
What? Trent's dead!

16:57.807 --> 16:59.342
Yeah, Officer, I know
what this looks like,

16:59.343 --> 17:01.778
but I promise I didn't kill
my boss and my best friend.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.314
I'll explain everything.
I'm innocent.

17:03.348 --> 17:05.816
Fingerprints on the letter
opener totally coincidental.

17:05.848 --> 17:07.050
Okay, wait.

17:07.085 --> 17:08.318
And the phone call you made to Trent

17:08.319 --> 17:09.886
just before you killed him,
just bad timing.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.623
No wait, wait, well,
you can go to the cops

17:11.655 --> 17:12.723
and you can explain everything.

17:12.723 --> 17:14.159
No, thanks.

17:14.191 --> 17:15.425
Like, just, just tell them
that I was with you.

17:15.426 --> 17:16.993
Look, there's a reason I'm a temp.

17:17.028 --> 17:18.496
Well, I have an alibi!

17:18.530 --> 17:21.499
Like, if I go into a police station
they're locking me up.

17:21.532 --> 17:22.734
Okay? Long story.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.068
What? What?
This is my life here!

17:24.103 --> 17:25.069
No way!

17:42.054 --> 17:45.491
One K 26 DC 911,
be advised one of these vehicles

17:45.524 --> 17:48.427
is probably involved right now.

17:48.461 --> 17:50.996
5953 are you responding?

17:51.030 --> 17:53.833
Alright homicide,
two officers down, Bridd Cole,

17:53.866 --> 17:56.536
male, Caucasian and
Charlotte Parker, three priors,

17:56.570 --> 17:59.306
female Caucasian,
consider armed and dangerous,

17:59.339 --> 18:01.675
apprehend by deadly force if necessary.

18:04.412 --> 18:05.212
Dead cops.

18:05.245 --> 18:06.446
Thank you.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.082
You still wanna go to the police?

18:38.414 --> 18:43.219
I spent, I spend my whole life
not being a criminal!

18:43.252 --> 18:45.287
I believe in the system!

18:45.321 --> 18:47.589
Yeah well, the system's
gonna shoot first.

18:47.623 --> 18:49.425
I want my life back!

18:50.926 --> 18:51.894
Good luck!

18:54.230 --> 18:56.031
I'm not gonna run forever!

18:56.065 --> 18:58.535
Trust me, it'll grow on you.

19:00.169 --> 19:02.104
And besides, in case
you haven't noticed,

19:02.138 --> 19:03.506
someone is trying to kill us.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.909
Who? Who's, who's
trying to wreck my life?

19:06.943 --> 19:09.979
Better question,
why are you so important?

19:10.013 --> 19:10.813
I'm not.

19:12.482 --> 19:15.286
Well, those men wanted something.

19:16.519 --> 19:20.223
I don't know.
Like, what's different?

19:24.161 --> 19:24.962
Nothing.

19:38.410 --> 19:42.481
So, your mom sent you that?

19:42.513 --> 19:43.415
I doubt it.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.217
I, I thought it was a joke.

19:46.251 --> 19:48.387
Yeah, hilarious.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.958
I think this might hold some answers,

19:52.991 --> 19:55.126
but I, I can't turn it on.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.470
Whoa!

20:08.441 --> 20:09.241
Oh, a game.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.813
Well, what are you waiting for?

20:22.423 --> 20:23.590
I'm a natural.

20:27.428 --> 20:28.228
Whoa.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:35.302 --> 20:36.937
Oh, damn!

20:43.477 --> 20:45.179
That's a new twist.

21:03.965 --> 21:06.435
Ah, you might wanna use that.

21:09.504 --> 21:10.673
What are you doing?

21:17.446 --> 21:20.149
You just wasted an entire chance!

21:41.638 --> 21:43.272
How on Earth...

22:04.028 --> 22:05.596
What just happened?

22:19.845 --> 22:21.813
Feel like a road trip?

22:27.720 --> 22:29.288
That was amazing.

22:30.189 --> 22:31.824
How did you do that?

22:33.192 --> 22:34.827
I just watched it.

22:41.935 --> 22:44.904
Yup.
This is the place.

22:49.709 --> 22:51.243
Cheerful.

22:54.047 --> 22:56.416
Get in, get out.

22:57.317 --> 22:59.086
Ah, I thought we'd hang.

22:59.119 --> 23:00.187
Have a scone.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.891
I think it's locked.

23:05.559 --> 23:06.795
Not anymore.

23:06.827 --> 23:10.197
Well, you are full of surprises.

23:13.201 --> 23:14.836
This isn't creepy.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.143
I don't get it.

23:22.177 --> 23:24.646
What, what are we looking for?

23:28.450 --> 23:30.919
The history of Virginia Ham.

23:39.995 --> 23:40.863
Wait a sec.

23:42.965 --> 23:45.868
Huh, dewey decimal.

23:45.902 --> 23:49.505
I never thought that
would be useful again.

24:19.070 --> 24:21.372
It should be here someplace.

24:33.885 --> 24:35.688
The numbers run out.

25:02.716 --> 25:05.619
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

25:07.486 --> 25:08.287
Wait, wait.

25:08.321 --> 25:09.122
What?

25:09.155 --> 25:10.957
What if it's a bomb?

25:13.660 --> 25:15.963
It doesn't sound like one.

25:18.899 --> 25:21.468
It's not a Christmas present.

25:26.340 --> 25:28.644
It is a Christmas present.

25:30.845 --> 25:31.647
Whoa.

25:35.215 --> 25:38.686
My folks never gave
me anything this cool.

25:57.706 --> 25:58.841
Run!

26:05.114 --> 26:06.015
Wait! Wait!

26:07.684 --> 26:10.486
Just take it.
This is what you're looking for!

26:10.520 --> 26:12.722
Please, just leave me alone!

26:49.729 --> 26:51.096
Hey, what the...

26:53.632 --> 26:55.700
Hold, hold it right there!

27:03.442 --> 27:04.910
Come on!

27:08.613 --> 27:10.950
He dodged a bullet.

27:23.595 --> 27:26.466
Hey, how did you catch that guy's punch?

27:26.499 --> 27:28.168
You were moving as fast as he did.

27:28.201 --> 27:30.336
I was trying not to die.

28:58.162 --> 28:59.429
Guess what.

28:59.463 --> 29:00.264
You snore.

29:02.332 --> 29:05.203
Wait, where's the, the ah, the...

29:08.072 --> 29:09.874
Um, I was a bad girl.

29:20.218 --> 29:21.520
I couldn't wait.

29:25.757 --> 29:30.494
But, it wouldn't let me in.

29:37.503 --> 29:38.704
It's a video.

29:40.073 --> 29:41.373
Awesome, right?

29:42.609 --> 29:43.409
Yeah.

29:44.843 --> 29:45.644
Awesome.

29:48.480 --> 29:49.381
It's great.

30:44.941 --> 30:45.740
So?

30:47.609 --> 30:48.577
I don't, how should I know?

30:48.578 --> 30:51.014
I don't even know who's asking.

30:53.016 --> 30:53.815
Try it.

31:05.495 --> 31:06.296
What?

31:08.165 --> 31:09.899
Somebody's messing with me.

31:09.932 --> 31:11.335
Well, what's the answer?

31:11.367 --> 31:14.805
No, there's no way anyone
could ever know that.

31:28.019 --> 31:28.820
Hello.

31:34.491 --> 31:41.133
I am...
I don't know how to start.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.637
I, I didn't even know if you'd remember

31:45.670 --> 31:48.741
that last birthday we spent together.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.043
Dad?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.980
I wish I could see you right now.

31:56.182 --> 31:59.385
Wonder if you look more like Jos or me.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.889
Look, I wanna explain everything

32:03.922 --> 32:06.760
but I don't have a lot of time

32:06.792 --> 32:08.327
and neither do you.

32:10.130 --> 32:13.933
Now, there's something you need to know.

32:13.966 --> 32:19.106
You and I are not normal.

32:21.175 --> 32:22.476
You're a hybrid.

32:24.644 --> 32:31.485
Our mission was to blend in,
to test for colonization.

32:31.519 --> 32:33.287
Colonization?

32:33.321 --> 32:39.694
Without success.
And then, I met Joselyn.

32:41.361 --> 32:49.304
When you were born, somehow, amazingly,

32:51.038 --> 32:56.010
you survived, a miracle.

32:56.044 --> 32:59.948
I had to leave to make
sure that you were safe.

33:02.984 --> 33:07.123
I'm so sorry that you had
to grow up without a family.

33:08.557 --> 33:10.526
I know what that's like.

33:11.461 --> 33:13.463
But they know about you now.

33:13.495 --> 33:15.365
This video's a warning,

33:16.498 --> 33:19.301
I just hope it reaches you in time.

33:38.756 --> 33:39.557
Bridd.

34:03.347 --> 34:04.516
No, don't!

34:18.297 --> 34:19.431
Yeah!

34:19.464 --> 34:20.264
Dad!

34:21.534 --> 34:22.668
Are you happy?

34:56.168 --> 34:57.804
Just leave me alone.

35:00.542 --> 35:03.410
If it is true, it's amazing news.

35:05.079 --> 35:07.114
Yeah, made my day.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.550
He reached out.

35:10.017 --> 35:11.586
After all this time.

35:11.619 --> 35:14.256
It's a perfect family reunion.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.997
Except for the part where
the dad tells his son

35:18.026 --> 35:19.727
he's a fucking alien.

35:27.235 --> 35:31.907
I spent 20 years trying
to create a normal life.

35:31.940 --> 35:35.779
Your normal life was not that great.

35:35.811 --> 35:41.418
No, I know how it looks, Officer.
It's okay.

35:41.450 --> 35:42.852
I'm a good alien.

35:45.554 --> 35:47.657
This could be an opportunity.

35:47.691 --> 35:49.358
I didn't ask for it.

35:49.393 --> 35:51.428
I'd love to be special.

35:53.530 --> 35:54.831
Be grateful that...

35:54.864 --> 35:55.765
Piss off.

36:24.862 --> 36:28.334
I didn't know which one I'd need to use.

36:47.654 --> 36:49.389
Wait, my purse is in there.

36:49.421 --> 36:51.590
Yeah the maid'll be thrilled.
Come on.

37:03.069 --> 37:05.406
We've maybe had the shittiest day ever.

37:05.438 --> 37:07.475
I've got an idea.

37:07.508 --> 37:10.543
Hiking, yay!

37:10.578 --> 37:11.379
Shut up.

38:05.501 --> 38:07.169
I'm sorry.

38:07.203 --> 38:08.839
It's just that, well,

38:11.040 --> 38:15.310
messages from my parents, people dying.

38:15.345 --> 38:16.412
Being framed.

38:16.447 --> 38:17.347
Chased.

38:17.380 --> 38:18.715
Finding out you're an alien.

38:22.453 --> 38:25.188
You know I've been fighting it.

38:26.256 --> 38:28.225
It actually makes sense.

38:30.794 --> 38:33.831
It explains a lot of things about me.

38:40.204 --> 38:43.908
Ever since I was 10,
I tried to be invisible.

38:46.711 --> 38:52.083
You know, fit in, not make waves.

38:53.118 --> 38:56.855
I pay my taxes early,
I drive the speed limit.

39:03.762 --> 39:05.899
I grew up in an orphanage.

39:07.066 --> 39:10.469
No, it's alright,
the nuns were totally cool.

39:16.710 --> 39:21.548
All the kids were dying to be adopted.

39:24.017 --> 39:26.486
Yeah, we all wanted last names.

39:30.357 --> 39:33.426
Well, I hit the jackpot when I was 10.

39:36.863 --> 39:39.600
This beautiful family adopted me.

39:39.634 --> 39:41.602
My last name was Morgan.

39:43.270 --> 39:47.407
That first week I was playing
ping pong with my brother

39:48.609 --> 39:52.446
and, um...

39:52.480 --> 39:57.618
turns out I was, I was pretty good.

39:57.653 --> 39:59.419
Was great actually.

39:59.454 --> 40:00.420
Obviously.

40:00.455 --> 40:03.158
He couldn't score a point.

40:03.191 --> 40:06.327
Then my adopted dad took over and, um,

40:09.397 --> 40:12.401
but he grew competitive and he,

40:12.433 --> 40:15.237
he started really getting into it.

40:18.974 --> 40:22.111
I still remember the score, 11 to two.

40:27.784 --> 40:29.485
So I started like jumping up and down

40:29.519 --> 40:31.654
with my hands, all excited.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.935
I thought everyone was gonna
jump up and down with me

40:44.968 --> 40:47.104
but they just stood there,

40:51.308 --> 40:52.276
stone quiet.

40:55.746 --> 40:59.718
A week later, they took
me back to the orphanage.

41:36.088 --> 41:38.291
Breakfast for dinner.

41:38.323 --> 41:41.762
Poached eggs, spinach and cheese omelet,

41:41.794 --> 41:46.132
smoked salmon scramble,
eggs benedict, gross.

41:47.233 --> 41:50.971
Chicken fried steak sounds good, though.

41:51.004 --> 41:53.306
Maybe I'll have the waffles.

41:55.742 --> 41:56.610
Bullshit.

41:58.045 --> 42:02.282
You saw that menu on that board
for what, like five seconds?

42:02.316 --> 42:04.450
Tell me about the waffles.

42:06.220 --> 42:10.124
Strawberry, boysenberry, maple.

42:10.157 --> 42:11.693
How much?

42:11.726 --> 42:16.998
Well two cost 3.99, four only cost 5.25.
It's clever pricing.

42:17.031 --> 42:19.802
Blueberries, an extra 50 cents, though.

42:19.834 --> 42:21.770
Think I feel like oatmeal.

42:22.937 --> 42:24.907
What's that? That weird?

42:26.942 --> 42:28.475
You have no idea.

42:43.192 --> 42:45.528
We need to go underground for a while.

42:45.561 --> 42:48.331
Get in, get in.

43:06.583 --> 43:09.219
Vacation houses kick ass.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.476
Mmm, I could get used to this.

43:33.812 --> 43:34.612
Sure.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.917
We just need to clear your name.

43:40.752 --> 43:41.552
Easy.

43:43.021 --> 43:44.655
Stop being a dick.

43:51.597 --> 43:54.133
We lead the cops to the aliens.

43:56.235 --> 43:57.905
We track them down.

43:57.937 --> 43:59.405
You're back to crazy.

43:59.438 --> 44:02.208
Just imagine, back to
the excitement of driving

44:02.241 --> 44:06.378
the speed limit and paying
taxes and folding laundry.

44:09.182 --> 44:11.017
How would we even find them?

44:11.051 --> 44:15.021
I have a hunch that you don't
know everything you can do.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.332
You snore too, FYI.

44:26.599 --> 44:27.735
Time to get crackin'.

44:27.767 --> 44:28.936
Mm mm.

44:28.969 --> 44:30.137
Mm hmm.

44:43.118 --> 44:46.720
I'll start you off with something
a little less dangerous.

44:46.755 --> 44:49.124
Are you sure this is necessary?

44:49.157 --> 44:50.158
My aim sucks.

44:50.192 --> 44:51.893
Come on, be a sport.

45:05.707 --> 45:06.776
Oh, no thanks.

45:08.643 --> 45:09.644
I got it.

46:19.718 --> 46:21.554
Smartie pants.

46:45.279 --> 46:48.582
What, what're we doin'?

46:50.750 --> 46:52.253
Whoa.

46:52.286 --> 46:54.855
Relax, your vitals are safe.

46:59.860 --> 47:00.661
Really?

47:02.530 --> 47:03.998
Whoops.

47:04.032 --> 47:06.401
I guess you're not that fast.

47:14.942 --> 47:18.247
Okay, I'm not actually convinced

47:18.280 --> 47:20.882
you haven't shot someone before.

47:20.916 --> 47:23.719
I was just marking my territory.

47:25.187 --> 47:26.989
The toll of kidnap victims in Virginia

47:27.023 --> 47:30.692
have been rising. Victims are
between the ages of 16 and 30.

47:30.726 --> 47:32.462
Several counties have instituted curfews

47:32.494 --> 47:33.761
while the perpetrators
are still at large.

47:33.762 --> 47:35.231
The Marine family went on air today

47:35.265 --> 47:36.632
to ask the abductors to please
return their daughter Sara.

47:36.633 --> 47:38.101
A cash reward is offered.

48:25.117 --> 48:26.385
They're here.

48:26.418 --> 48:28.553
We'll meet the cops there.

48:30.122 --> 48:30.922
What?

48:32.224 --> 48:34.459
What's it like being you?

49:52.275 --> 49:53.075
Wow.

49:57.180 --> 50:00.317
I could get used to boning an alien.

50:02.485 --> 50:06.756
I guess I better hurry up
and clear my name then, huh?

50:06.790 --> 50:10.594
I guess you better,
before I change my mind.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.404
Keep it interesting
so I don't get bored.

50:24.342 --> 50:26.411
Why would you say that?

50:27.412 --> 50:28.378
Sensitive.

50:31.916 --> 50:33.718
Don't be such a pussy.

50:39.424 --> 50:40.225
Hey.

50:44.429 --> 50:45.663
Come on.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.369
We're having fun.

50:56.242 --> 50:57.142
Embrace it.

50:57.175 --> 50:58.211
Embrace it?

50:59.445 --> 51:02.414
Like you've had to embrace anything.

51:05.083 --> 51:07.319
You abandon everything
in your entire life.

51:07.353 --> 51:11.056
Bouncing around from town to
town, job to job, guy to guy.

51:11.090 --> 51:14.026
Yeah well, eventually the
tortured hero act gets boring.

51:14.059 --> 51:15.627
Yeah well, I guess you'll
stick around 'til you get sick

51:15.628 --> 51:18.465
of free lunches, or I get
myself killed then, huh?

51:18.498 --> 51:21.834
I got another souvenir for you.

51:21.869 --> 51:22.669
Here.

51:56.438 --> 51:57.739
I need a taxi.

52:00.074 --> 52:01.943
An hour, whatever, fine.

53:02.540 --> 53:04.008
More coffee, sir?

53:09.080 --> 53:11.417
Oh shoot, I'm so sorry.

53:11.449 --> 53:12.917
It's my first day.

53:18.391 --> 53:19.925
Hey, you're doing fine.

53:19.958 --> 53:21.394
Really?

53:21.427 --> 53:24.363
Yeah, I like to slurp my
coffee from the table anyways.

53:28.233 --> 53:30.604
Just relax, it'll get better.

53:32.872 --> 53:35.007
Just gotta give it a shot.

53:38.044 --> 53:40.414
But you gotta give it a shot.

54:18.519 --> 54:19.955
I knew you'd come back.

54:28.830 --> 54:31.833
Okay, maybe I pushed you a bit too hard,

54:31.868 --> 54:37.272
so I am willing to extend my month
to month lease just for you,

54:37.306 --> 54:40.009
assuming you stop being an asshole.

56:17.244 --> 56:19.012
911, what's your emergency?

56:19.046 --> 56:21.915
Listen carefully, I've found
who you're looking for.

56:40.501 --> 56:42.937
I can't run forever.

59:53.771 --> 59:56.407
Sh, sh, sh.
I'm here to save you.

59:58.375 --> 59:59.710
I guess.

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:24.569
Come and rape me!

01:00:30.175 --> 01:00:33.847
Run, stay hidden, go!

01:02:36.807 --> 01:02:38.276
My blood.

01:02:43.782 --> 01:02:44.583
Cloning.

01:02:56.228 --> 01:02:57.530
What is it, then?

01:03:28.861 --> 01:03:30.531
You came for me.

01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:32.899
Yeah, I like to make an entrance.

01:03:32.933 --> 01:03:35.303
And then you got captured.

01:03:35.336 --> 01:03:39.574
Look, I love you but I'm trying
to get us out of here, okay?

01:03:39.606 --> 01:03:40.907
Can you help me?

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.212
Okay.

01:03:44.245 --> 01:03:46.481
Can you slide closer to me?

01:04:01.497 --> 01:04:03.299
Alright, alright good.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.337
Now, can you feel the
buttons on my cuffs?

01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:09.171
Yeah.

01:04:09.205 --> 01:04:10.005
Okay.

01:04:11.407 --> 01:04:14.677
Now I'm gonna tell you
which buttons to push, okay?

01:04:24.988 --> 01:04:26.790
Push the first button.

01:04:29.659 --> 01:04:30.726
Button three.

01:04:33.563 --> 01:04:34.364
Okay, good.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.369
Button three again.

01:04:41.738 --> 01:04:42.707
Shit.

01:04:45.742 --> 01:04:46.711
Okay.

01:04:48.012 --> 01:04:50.480
Alright, we have to focus, okay?

01:04:50.515 --> 01:04:52.250
There's no room for error.

01:04:52.283 --> 01:04:54.385
I'm trying, I'm nervous.

01:04:55.686 --> 01:04:58.523
Every time you press a wrong button

01:04:58.556 --> 01:05:00.591
the cuffs clamp harder.

01:05:00.625 --> 01:05:01.426
Wait, what?

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.260
Yeah.

01:05:02.294 --> 01:05:04.463
No pressure.

01:05:24.082 --> 01:05:24.883
Okay.

01:05:27.754 --> 01:05:30.490
Now, four, four, two.

01:05:35.794 --> 01:05:37.297
Three, one, four.

01:05:41.468 --> 01:05:43.337
Stay with me.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.805
Just when I like a guy,
I try to kill him.

01:05:45.838 --> 01:05:48.242
Two, one, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:51.544 --> 01:05:52.680
That's not it.

01:05:54.047 --> 01:05:56.217
We're gonna try again, okay?

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.418
Think.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:06:00.921
No, no, just, sh,
don't, sh, don't think.

01:06:00.954 --> 01:06:03.258
Just say it.

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.663
Three, one, two, four.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.571
One, two, two, one.

01:06:17.806 --> 01:06:19.039
One, two, four, three, four, three,

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.441
one, four, one, one, three, two, four.

01:06:21.276 --> 01:06:22.076
Oh, shit.

01:06:26.047 --> 01:06:26.848
Done.

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:16.133
Hi.

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:22.706
Hey, wait wait wait, what're we doing?

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:23.708
I need to find the blood vial.

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:24.909
Why?

01:07:24.942 --> 01:07:25.977
That's all they wanted from me.

01:07:35.186 --> 01:07:36.889
Check the other side.

01:07:41.059 --> 01:07:42.361
Find the vial, go!

01:07:43.429 --> 01:07:44.229
Go!

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:19.158
Looking for this?

01:10:23.996 --> 01:10:24.797
I get it.

01:10:27.601 --> 01:10:33.975
The abductions, the sick tests,
the gas tanks,

01:10:37.077 --> 01:10:39.112
you can't breath the air.

01:10:41.482 --> 01:10:42.282
I can.

01:10:44.651 --> 01:10:47.154
That's why you needed my blood.

01:10:47.187 --> 01:10:51.325
You can extract my DNA and
genetically modify yourselves.

01:10:53.461 --> 01:10:57.298
Bingo, colonization.

01:11:29.965 --> 01:11:34.103
Oh God, he's getting away with the vial.

01:11:47.685 --> 01:11:48.885
He's leaving.

01:11:51.622 --> 01:11:53.357
Come on, short cut.

01:12:29.127 --> 01:12:30.329
Not a chance.

01:12:32.297 --> 01:12:33.098
Take the gun.

01:12:33.132 --> 01:12:34.333
What?

01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:36.268
I don't need to have good aim if you do.

01:12:36.302 --> 01:12:37.670
You aim, I shoot.

01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:40.106
You're crazy.

01:12:43.176 --> 01:12:44.076
Aim for that.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.344
The mailbox?

01:12:45.378 --> 01:12:47.447
Yeah, he's gonna drive right past it.

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:48.948
Okay.

01:13:34.697 --> 01:13:38.000
You're right.
We make a good team.

01:13:58.421 --> 01:14:00.223
Go! Run!

01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:24.882
No!

01:14:29.722 --> 01:14:30.521
Bridd!

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:24.478
I guess I am that fast.

01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:26.881
I told you not to cry wolf.

01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:36.190
I got something for ya.

01:15:36.223 --> 01:15:37.024
What?

01:15:50.639 --> 01:15:52.774
Well, it catches the light.

01:15:53.975 --> 01:15:56.611
I guess this makes me
your girlfriend, huh?

01:15:56.645 --> 01:15:57.678
I guess so.

01:17:19.965 --> 01:17:22.535
You've got your life back.

01:17:25.837 --> 01:17:26.873
What's wrong?

01:17:30.276 --> 01:17:33.413
I've got family out there somewhere.

01:17:35.581 --> 01:17:38.185
Speaking of family.

01:17:41.054 --> 01:17:43.856
There's something you should know.

01:17:45.026 --> 01:17:48.662
Why are you smiling like that?

01:17:48.695 --> 01:17:50.331
Well...

01:17:54.055 --> 01:17:57.055
