11:39.833 --> 11:42.167
PINK HAT? OH, THAT'S NOT A HAT.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.202
THAT'S MY BRAIN.

I CAN'T GO.

13:13.860 --> 13:17.629
I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO TAKE CARE OF GARY.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.572
WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP
LEAVING YOUR UNDERGARMENTS

14:08.415 --> 14:09.681
DON'T FEEL BAD,
SQUIDWARD.

19:41.948 --> 19:42.847
I'M FINE.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.182
I WORRY TOO MUCH.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.950
IT'S ALL IN MY HEAD.

NEVER BETTER.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.333
(<i> yelps</i> )

20:02.335 --> 20:03.901
I'M OKAY.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.266
OW.

20:35.268 --> 20:39.770
I HOPE I NEVER SEE
ANOTHER SNAIL AGAIN.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.475
WHO COULD THAT BE?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.310
AS IF I DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW.

20:46.312 --> 20:50.047
SPONGEBOB, I ALREADY TOLD YOU:

21:11.971 --> 21:16.107
OH, NEPTUNE, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.109
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.910
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
