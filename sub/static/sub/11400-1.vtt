CALABRESE:
Hey, Mikey, la luce, the light.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.974
VALERO: Calabrese, nice to see you.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.025
Who are these other mystery guests?

02:35.405 --> 02:39.116
CALABRESE:
Murder is a very serious business, my friend.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.743
And an expensive one.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.164
TRENT:
You'll be very well compensated, Mr. Calabrese.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.208
Money now, and lots more
when l get in that office.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.294
You can take that to the bank.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.546
CALABRESE:
Slowly. Slowly.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.923
And always with caution.

02:55.133 --> 02:59.219
TRENT: Listen. I want you to turn
Senator Caldwell into a memory.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.931
I'm not waiting for him
to die of natural causes.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.934
CALABRESE:
All l'm counseling is patience.

03:06.269 --> 03:09.771
The man is public.
He's in the papers every day.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.941
TRENT: Next time l read about him,
it better be the obituaries.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.943
Who are you?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.279
Get out of the shadows.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.864
VALERO:
Enough bullshit.

03:19.157 --> 03:23.368
VALERO: Can you do this job or not?
CALABRESE: It'll be taken care of.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.956
TRENT: Gentlemen, enough bickering.
This is business.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.169
TRENT:
I think we understand each other.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.047
CALABRESE:
Then let's just stick to business.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.718
TRENT:
It's a light plane.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.137
TRENT:
A Lear P-61 .

03:42.639 --> 03:46.642
We want it to take off.
We don't want it to land.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.477

03:49.479 --> 03:50.479
TRENT:
What the--

03:55.818 --> 03:58.153
You told me this dock was clean.

04:08.831 --> 04:12.292
Mikey. Quit playing
with yourself back there.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.844
CALABRESE: Get that bastard.
TRENT: Let's get out of here.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.373
I don't want him to get an hour older.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.750
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.

Axel, line 3.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.648
Throwing away dimes now?

05:17.066 --> 05:19.860
This doesn't go out.
For your ears only.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.241
What?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.785
Calabrese.
I got his ass on film.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.579
You're full of shit.

05:30.913 --> 05:35.375

make. l think they'll come up on film.

05:39.589 --> 05:43.842

05:46.429 --> 05:48.347

Got any champagne?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.118
Right next to the caviar.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.621
-That was funny.
-Great.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.332
In the big cooler back there.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.543
How come you're not watching
the Oscars tonight?

06:19.670 --> 06:20.712
The Oscars?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.005
Yeah, the Oscars.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.590
I hate the Oscars.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.425
You're not having a good time?

06:25.635 --> 06:28.220
Who needs the goddamn movies?

06:29.472 --> 06:32.140

You should film it.
Get your own show.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.862
I'll be great in a porno.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.993
Better dial 91 1 .

06:52.328 --> 06:55.163
PUNK 1 :
You don't want to call 91 1 .

They're out eating doughnuts.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.707
I got half a mind to bash your--

I'll cut your heart out.

Yeah? Come and cut my heart out.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.019
Come and cut my heart out.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.812
Come on, punk.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.983
I know what you're thinking.
Mine's bigger than yours.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.777
It's not fair.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.612
I'll throw it away.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.951
What if I show you
what it's like to be a victim?

08:58.162 --> 09:00.622
STORM: Come on.
PUNK 2: You're fucking dead, man.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.668
It's still not fair.
Okay, I'll get down on my knees.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.336
Better?

09:08.381 --> 09:09.548
Come get some.

I know that voice.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.134
Is that you, honey?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.345
STORM:
Yeah, baby.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.347

10:55.738 --> 10:57.238
What are you doing?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.324
STORM:
I'm raiding the icebox.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.035
I gave up my diet for Lent.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.666
Champagne?

11:08.876 --> 11:11.252
STORM:
Does that put you in the mood?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.589
Think this could do it?

11:23.516 --> 11:26.142
FELICIA: l had to bribe him to go
to bed with six cookies. . .

11:26.352 --> 11:28.186

11:33.317 --> 11:35.485
I wish I could sleep like that.

Maybe I can help you.

There you go.

11:51.711 --> 11:56.297
-Did you say your prayers?
-I wanted to do them with you.

11:57.049 --> 12:01.594
There's a trick to getting
what you want when you say prayers.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.680
What, Daddy?

12:03.931 --> 12:07.934
You ask for things for other people,
like your mom and Uncle O'Malley.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.396
Then how do I get stuff for myself?

12:11.814 --> 12:14.399
That's why God invented work.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.694
Want to say a little prayer with me?
Come here.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.865
Want to say your prayers?

12:22.324 --> 12:25.201
Now l lay me down to sleep.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.998
And we say together:
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.917
If I die before l wake. . .

12:33.127 --> 12:36.129

I had a shitty day today.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.798
There's blood on your shirt.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.716
It's not my blood.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.427
So you don't have to worry.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.105
If people knew how sweet you are. . .

13:36.899 --> 13:39.234

13:45.407 --> 13:46.908
I'm not scared of you.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.118
Maybe you should be.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.260
We'll try to squeeze it in.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.263
I'm in a silly mood.

He was jacked up on coke.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.467
I'll tell you something.
He was the cleanest man l knew.

Your man's alive, lieutenant.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.816
Who else knows he isn't dead?

20:35.984 --> 20:37.735
Just the people in here.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.987
I want to see each of them.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.908
And no one else comes in here
as of now. You got that?

20:49.915 --> 20:52.333
DOCTOR:
Lieutenant, this is still a hospital.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.669
I appreciate your problem.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.005
But l'm acting under orders
of the police commissioner.

20:58.340 --> 21:01.175
-I hope you can document that.
-I can and will.

21:02.344 --> 21:07.265
Mason Storm's going to vanish,
and you'll help make that happen.

21:07.724 --> 21:12.603

the deader he is, the safer he is.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.703

22:30.682 --> 22:34.810
Doctor Carlin's ordered
a glucose drip for Jimmy C.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.731
Max's E.E.G. monitor's
developing a nice electronic hiccup.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.441
Poor Max.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.444
And your boyfriend turned his head.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.029
ANDY:
He did?

22:45.238 --> 22:49.784
I thought he was going to sit up.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.997
Be right back.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.672
Would you like a little pussy?

23:44.923 --> 23:48.300
A little bitty pussy.
Look what l've got here.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.268
John Doe, can you hear me?

23:58.478 --> 24:03.149

27:17.218 --> 27:20.471

What's the change?

27:22.849 --> 27:26.310
The patient has come out
of a coma after seven years.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.812

GOODHART [OVER PHONE]: And please,
contact no one else on this matter.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.898
My wife and family were murdered.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.401

Hulland, plaster Storm's ass
with slime in the press.

HULLAND:
We know how to do our job.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.849
Then show me. l'm starring in the

I'm looking at 30 years.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.073
Geraldo.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.409
Who's this guy?

38:49.577 --> 38:53.538
Our program came to an
unexpectedly violent conclusion.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.933
Are you crazy?
I can't come in to work.

39:14.226 --> 39:17.103
I can't even go
to my apartment, Martha.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.105
People are dead.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.940
MARTHA [OVER PHONE]:
Then where are you?

39:21.108 --> 39:24.069

ANNOUNCER [OVER TV]: Senator Vernon
Trent promises no new taxes.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.792

What'll I do with this guy?
I want to help him. . .

39:45.966 --> 39:49.886
. . .but he's all over TV.
He's a crooked cop involved in--

39:53.641 --> 39:55.392

39:57.103 --> 39:58.937
DUNPHY [OVER TV]:
Police speculate that Storm. . .

39:59.146 --> 40:03.358
. . .who is known to have ties
with criminal elements. ..

40:03.651 --> 40:06.486
. . .could have involved
his contacts in his escape.

40:06.821 --> 40:10.156
Storm was thought to have been
a murder victim. A casualty. ..

40:10.491 --> 40:13.368
. . .of his own greed.
A widespread search is now being--

40:18.499 --> 40:22.085
This is Mason Storm. I'd like
to speak with Jerry Dunphy.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.173
No, it's not a joke.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.513
We can't stay here.
They'll trace us from the hospital.

40:33.889 --> 40:37.392
Nobody knows l'm here.
I'm housesitting.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.520
It belongs to a friend of my parents.

40:40.896 --> 40:43.523
He's in China on research for six months.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.152
The medical center
only has my apartment address.

40:47.403 --> 40:50.447
Not even my friends have this number.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.825
You've got to believe me.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.327
You're safe here, okay?

40:59.415 --> 41:03.543
DUNPHY [OVER TV]: This reporter was
contacted personally by the "Coma Cop".. .

41:03.794 --> 41:05.503
. . .fugitive officer Mason Storm.. .

41:05.713 --> 41:08.840
. . .who, until days ago,
had been in a seven-year coma.

41:09.216 --> 41:13.887
Storm said he's innocent of charges
made against him in the press. . .

41:14.138 --> 41:16.723
. . .and that he has
indisputable proof of this.

41:17.057 --> 41:20.727
He has promised me a first look
at his alleged proof.

41:22.229 --> 41:25.732
I want 24-hour surveillance
on that son of a bitch. . .

41:26.025 --> 41:28.443
. . .and those two nurses from the hospital.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.206
No, I can do it myself.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.249
You do it then.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.094
You give me this beard?

42:05.981 --> 42:07.106
You tried.

42:17.451 --> 42:20.787
-You ever been to Chinatown?
-Yeah. Why?

42:22.581 --> 42:27.043
This is a list of herbs and needles
that I need for my recovery.

42:27.294 --> 42:29.629
Where did you learn to write Chinese?

42:31.215 --> 42:36.219
When I was a kid, my dad was a
missionary. l was raised in the Orient.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.805
As a young white boy over there. . .

42:39.056 --> 42:42.642
. . . I needed to learn how to fight,
as you can imagine.

42:43.018 --> 42:44.143
I remember. . .

42:44.645 --> 42:47.480
. . .my first martial arts teacher
said to me:

42:47.898 --> 42:50.233
"So why do you come to me?"

42:51.068 --> 42:53.152
I say,
"To learn how to fight."

42:53.320 --> 42:56.239
And he says,
"So you want to hurt people.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.993
But do you want to be great?"
I say, "Yeah.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.912
I want to be great."

43:03.581 --> 43:08.626
He says, "Then first learn how
to heal people to be great.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.504
To hurt people is easy."

43:32.693 --> 43:35.361
Look at you.
You look great.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.696
Like it?

43:49.627 --> 43:52.211
That's enough.
Why don't you go sit down?

44:02.222 --> 44:03.806
That bad?

44:07.227 --> 44:10.229
If you need me,
I'll be in the outer room.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.225
STORM: O'Malley's the key.
We must find him.

46:52.392 --> 46:56.729
ANDY: You can't compare blood pressure
now with when you're in a coma.

46:56.897 --> 46:59.315
What's this?
555 over four digits.

46:59.525 --> 47:01.567
ANDY: That's crazy.
Let me see that.

47:02.486 --> 47:05.822
Martha's chicken scratches.
She probably can't even read them.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.740
-You know what it is?
-What?

47:08.075 --> 47:09.826
It's a phone number.

47:26.510 --> 47:27.885
Hello.

47:36.395 --> 47:40.898
When you phoned I asked
everyone here at the home. . .

47:41.191 --> 47:45.695
. . .and there is no O'Malley here.
But it is possible. . .

47:46.196 --> 47:49.323
. . .O'Malley is a relation
of someone here.

47:49.825 --> 47:54.829
Why not leave me your number and
I'll call you if there's any contact.

47:56.456 --> 47:57.874
Can l phone you?

47:58.959 --> 48:00.710
Of course, my dear.

48:02.129 --> 48:05.089
-Here, let me do that.
-That's all right.

48:05.924 --> 48:07.466
It's okay.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.260
Thank you.

Looking for Martha?

53:56.066 --> 53:57.483
You know where she is?

54:00.195 --> 54:02.321
You haven't seen the news?

54:03.740 --> 54:05.199
She's dead.

54:06.493 --> 54:09.203
She was strangled over in Westwood.

54:10.664 --> 54:11.705

The kid's a track star.

55:46.509 --> 55:48.886
He does the hundred in 1 1 flat.

55:49.262 --> 55:52.556
He's going to be real fast,
like his old man was.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.308
What do you mean "was"?

55:55.226 --> 55:57.019
I'm not over the hill.

At least, l hope not.

56:00.857 --> 56:02.858
How'd you pull this off?

He made it to my house
the night you were shot.

56:07.197 --> 56:10.783

like he was dead. . .

56:11.076 --> 56:13.410
. . .staged his funeral
with yours and Felicia's.

56:13.912 --> 56:15.788

Your nurse friend? Yeah.
She left a number and l traced you here.

I don't know how to thank you.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.069

56:48.405 --> 56:50.989
Just seeing your ugly ass alive
is enough for me.

57:04.170 --> 57:06.255
That night in the hospital. . .

57:07.674 --> 57:10.175
. . . I found the audio tape in your vest.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.679

in the voices, phrases that repeat.

57:20.186 --> 57:21.770
STORM:
Where is the tape?

57:22.021 --> 57:24.189
-I turned it in for evidence.
-What?

57:24.399 --> 57:25.858
Don't worry, I made a dupe.

57:26.192 --> 57:29.111
Meanwhile, l thought you'd
take some pleasure in this.

57:31.364 --> 57:33.365
O'MALLEY:
And there's more in the car.

57:34.534 --> 57:36.702
You were not wrong, my friend.

57:38.037 --> 57:39.830
You were not wrong.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.674
What's happened to you?

58:02.479 --> 58:05.230
O'MALLEY: l was on the case
maybe a year and a half. . .

58:05.440 --> 58:07.941
. . .trying to find out
who pulled the trigger.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.320
But it was like swimming through shit.

58:11.529 --> 58:16.241
Everywhere l turned,
people told me to back off, get lost.

58:17.076 --> 58:19.077
Then one morning the phone rings.

58:19.370 --> 58:21.371

58:22.707 --> 58:25.042
Someone ran my mother off the road.

58:25.376 --> 58:28.170
Her back's broken.
She's paralyzed.

58:29.464 --> 58:31.715
STORM:
I'm sorry, O'Mal.

58:33.927 --> 58:38.931
O'MALLEY: That night, there's a note in
my locker telling me it's no accident.

58:40.099 --> 58:41.767
What the hell could l do?

58:42.060 --> 58:46.104
I've got my hands tied behind
my back. I can't wave or salute.

58:47.273 --> 58:49.608
So I put my papers in.

58:50.735 --> 58:52.986
Took a three-quarter pension.

58:53.988 --> 58:56.532
You know me,
I never would have backed off.

58:57.075 --> 59:00.953
But there was Sonny to worry about.
What if they found him?

59:02.121 --> 59:04.373
-Or you?
-No, you did the right thing.

59:04.582 --> 59:06.458
Then wasn't the time.

59:06.709 --> 59:08.085
Now's the time.

59:08.378 --> 59:12.422
We're outgunned and undermanned,
but we're going to win.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.383
And I'll tell you why.

59:14.717 --> 59:18.387
Superior attitude,
superior state of mind.

59:22.141 --> 59:23.892
We'll get them, buddy.

59:24.269 --> 59:25.727
Believe me.

59:34.445 --> 59:36.321
Every fucking one of them.

59:54.841 --> 59:59.344
One more favor:
Get Sonny out of that school now.

59:59.679 --> 01:00:04.266
With me up and running, they'll
do anything to find Sonny to get to me.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:06.852
Get him someplace safe, anywhere.

01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:08.770
O'MALLEY:
Consider it done.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.107
I'm going straight to get that film.

You found him.
The old lady was his mother.

Good evening, sir.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:36.267
Do you have any messages
for an Andrea Smith, please?

01:12:57.873 --> 01:13:00.124
Don't worry, Sonny's okay.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:04.462
He's with O'Malley, who has the tape.
They're headed for Union Station.

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:08.341
Great. Let's go get the car.
Just a minute.

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:11.761
ANDY: What's wrong?
-Shit.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:14.055
Fuck.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.155
HULLAND:
Cover me.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.907
HULLAND: Don't move.
You're surrounded.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:49.090
HULLAND:
Send for backup.

01:13:53.637 --> 01:13:56.264
MAN :
Hey. You can't do that in Dallas.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.766
MAN :
That's a rented car.

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:03.980
HULLAND:
Get the goddamn car.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.690
AXEL:
Get the car.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:44.812

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.360
Your train's the Southwest Chief.

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:10.004
My hands are shaking.

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.006
Don't worry, kid.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:16.594
Even your old Uncle Mally's paws
wobble a bit from time to time.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.054
Put this on.

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:21.432
Watch out for the hot dog.
Don't spill mustard .

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.231
Sonny. . . .

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:33.069
I know it's hard to put together
after all these years.

01:15:33.987 --> 01:15:38.199
I'm sorry I told you your dad
was dead . l thought it was best.

01:15:38.992 --> 01:15:40.993
I know it's awkward.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.288
But your father loves you very much.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.376
You've got to get to know each
other again. It'll take time.

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:50.378
Now listen up.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.757
If your dad gets here on schedule,
you both get on the train.

01:15:55.008 --> 01:15:57.593
If he doesn't, you'll be going alone.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:01.013
One of us will be one step behind .
Don't worry.

01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:06.978
One step behind.

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:10.731
Just like we planned in the car
on the way here.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.987
O'Malley, long time no see.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.323
Make sure your father gets this.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:26.664
Are you taking a trip?

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:31.627
Yeah, me and my kid are visiting
my mother in New Mexico.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:34.338
That's your son?

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:38.175
Funny, he doesn't look much like you.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.636
Does he, Quentero?

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:42.847
As a matter of fact. . .

01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:46.058
. . . I think I've seen
his ugly face before.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.644
Kind of looks like Mason Storm.

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:57.278
Enough of this fucking around.
We want the tape.

01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:08.372
Run, Sonny.

01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:15.212
Mally.

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:35.983
QUENTERO: Take him.
We're going after the kid .

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.529
O'MALLEY:
I love you, Sonny.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.408
You fucks don't deserve your badges.

01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:54.085
BECKER: Come here,
you little son of a bitch.

01:17:55.128 --> 01:17:57.296
QUENTERO: The kid's got the tape.
BECKER: Get his ass.

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:10.601
Sonny.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.561
QUENTERO:
He's going in the alley.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.735
ATTENDANT:
I'll call the police.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:21.404

Get out of the way.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.575
ANDY:
Help. Help.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.078
ATTENDANT: This guy's crazy.
He broke my gate.

01:18:30.288 --> 01:18:31.580
ANDY:
Stop.

01:18:31.998 --> 01:18:33.040
Please stop.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.890
BECKER: My hand's bleeding bad.
Go ahead.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:11.120
QUENTERO: Stop.
You little bastard.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.303
BECKER:
Come on, don't mess with me.

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:30.014
BECKER:
You fuck. My leg.

01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:35.019
QUENTERO:
Come here or l'll kill you.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:44.195
BECKER:
I broke my fucking leg.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.551
Coma Cop, let's see what you got.

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:12.807
SONNY:
Dad.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.193
You're still a loser.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:10.406
I remember you.

01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:32.136
SONNY:
Dad.

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:38.601
(SI RENS)

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:57.828
ANDY:
Storm.

01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:01.749
STORM: Take care of him.
ANDY: Where are you going?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.919
STORM: One more take-out order.
You're safe with her.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.378
ANDY:
You're okay with me.

01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:09.256
(I N FORElGN LANGUAGE)

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.351
Who are you?

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.270
It's a very long story.

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:25.189
You got a few minutes?

01:23:04.854 --> 01:23:06.063
HULLAND:
Senator.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:12.653
I know it's a bad time,
but things have happened--

01:23:12.862 --> 01:23:15.823
TRENT:
I want Quentero and the others here now.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:18.409
Storm is just nuts enough
to come after me.

01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:20.577
HULLAND:
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:23:21.037 --> 01:23:24.039
TRENT:
Can we have a little privacy, please?

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:27.167
HULLAND:
I'll be downstairs.

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:33.590
We're not going to make the
ballet tonight. Take a hike.

01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:35.092
Get lost.

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.763
AXEL:
I'll show you guys how to break.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.654
How's the action, boys?

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.114
Mind if I play?

01:24:42.285 --> 01:24:46.663
I know you're thinking, if l have
this in my hand, l can't play.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:48.582
How's this?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:50.584
I'll put it away.

01:24:57.634 --> 01:25:00.052
STORM:
Well? Somebody hand me a cue.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.450
Impressive.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.835
That's for my wife.
Fuck you and die.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.234
Son of a bitch.

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:57.377
STORM: How does it feel to know
you're about to die?

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:06.762
I'll give you more time
than you gave my wife and son.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.284
HULLAND:
I got to tell you.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:30.953
You can't do this.
It wasn't me.

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:43.632
Now you're a good cop.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:55.811
STORM:
Vernon?

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.858
Let's try in here.

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.209
Maybe you're behind this painting.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.380
No. You're so good at this, Vernon.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.508
Maybe you're under the bed .

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:30.304
No, not under the bed .

01:28:35.226 --> 01:28:37.561
What about in here?

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:48.822
Vernon, where are you?

01:29:09.552 --> 01:29:10.719
Die.

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:26.777
How do you like this, Vernon?

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:30.530
I'd like to kill you so bad,
I can barely contain myself.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:32.199
But l've been thinking.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:35.535
Death is far too merciful
a fate for you.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:37.746
So what l'm going to do is. . .

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:41.041
. . .put you in prison.

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:45.253
A nice petite white boy like you
in a federal penitentiary. . . .

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:50.592
Let me put it this way: You won't be
able to stay anal-retentive very long.

01:29:51.427 --> 01:29:53.762
I'm going to take
these handcuffs here. . .

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:58.642
. . .then l'll arrest you and
I'll take you in. How's that?

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.329
Come on. What are you doing?

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.456
No, please. No.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.500
No. No.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.128
(GUNSHOT)

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.425
I missed.

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.344
I never miss.

01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:37.681
They must have been smaller
than l thought.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.601
Freeze.

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:44.521
OFFICER:
Drop the gun. Slowly.

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:47.399
Get on your knees

TRENT: Thank God.
Thank God you guys are here.

01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:51.820
Do it now.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:55.949
TRENT:
You got to stop him.

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.873
Let me go. Storm, no.

01:31:05.168 --> 01:31:06.501
SERGEANT:
Storm.

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:09.671
SERGEANT: Storm, no.
Hold it right there.

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:13.467
TRENT: Sergeant, talk to him.
Tell him to let me go.

01:31:18.681 --> 01:31:20.223
Give me the gun.

01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:26.646
SERGEANT:
Give me the gun.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.400
Give me the gun.

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:35.405
We saw the film.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.949
We know you were set up.

01:31:39.076 --> 01:31:41.244
SERGEANT:
Senator, you're under arrest.

01:31:42.705 --> 01:31:43.872
Cuff him.

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.335
TRENT:
What the hell are you talking about?

01:31:48.711 --> 01:31:51.880
What are you talking about?
You can't do this to me.

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:56.259
I'm a senator, for Christ's sake.
You can't do this to me.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.517
We're sorry, Storm.

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.938
You're a dead man, Storm.

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:11.608
Do you hear me.
You won't get away with this.

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.777
Dad. Dad.

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.530
