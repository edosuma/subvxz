<i>Hi, Sawyer.
It's Cindy Mansfield</i>

01:26.302 --> 01:27.802
<i>from Landler-Bayne calling.</i>

01:27.804 --> 01:30.170
<i>I just wanted to confirm
your interview this week..</i>

01:30.172 --> 01:32.306
- Yes.
- <i>We are looking at a few other candidates.</i>

01:32.308 --> 01:34.809
<i>But as you know we were all
very impressed with the work</i>

01:34.811 --> 01:38.112
<i>you did last summer and we have
a great feeling about you.</i>

01:38.114 --> 01:40.048
<i>I've emailed you
all the details</i>

01:40.050 --> 01:42.016
<i>so we will see you
on Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.</i>

01:42.018 --> 01:44.552
<i>at our offices in DC
Safe drive!</i>

02:40.943 --> 02:42.142
<i>State police are on the scene</i>

02:42.144 --> 02:43.509
<i>rerouting traffic
to surface streets</i>

02:43.511 --> 02:45.579
<i>that's gonna create a little
bit of chaos here</i>

02:45.581 --> 02:47.080
<i>but that's holiday
traffic for you.</i>

02:47.082 --> 02:48.749
<i>Yeah, it's a nightmare
down there.</i>

02:48.751 --> 02:49.850
<i>Just in time for Thanksgiving
weekend, unfortunately.</i>

02:49.852 --> 02:51.484
<i>Rerouting.</i>

02:51.486 --> 02:53.987
<i>If you're traveling around that
area, your best bet is to stay</i>

02:53.989 --> 02:55.889
<i>as far away from the highway
as possible.</i>

02:55.891 --> 02:58.058
<i>We will keep you informed
throughout the day</i>

02:58.060 --> 03:01.895
<i>only on 1270 WLUN, Kentucky.</i>

03:01.897 --> 03:05.531
<i>Okay, would you rather have
a room full of pennies</i>

03:05.533 --> 03:09.769
<i>or a stack of pennies as high
as the Empire State Building?</i>

03:09.771 --> 03:12.505
<i>Uh, I think I'd take
the big stack.</i>

03:12.507 --> 03:13.773
<i>I'd be rich.</i>

03:13.775 --> 03:15.110
<i>Weak.</i>

03:17.912 --> 03:21.180
<i>Rerouting to Washington, DC.</i>

04:31.017 --> 04:34.052
<i>In 30 miles, turn right.</i>

05:03.415 --> 05:06.518
<i>In 500 feet make a right turn.</i>

05:10.656 --> 05:12.625
<i>Make a right turn.</i>

05:29.174 --> 05:30.743
It's not even a road.

05:38.150 --> 05:40.085
Guess we're taking
the next right.

05:50.795 --> 05:53.230
<i>Make a U-turn, if possible.</i>

05:53.232 --> 05:56.135
Give me better directions,
if possible.

06:42.981 --> 06:45.316
<i>Make a U-turn, if possible.</i>

06:53.690 --> 06:55.159
<i>Turn left.</i>

07:08.038 --> 07:09.806
Think they seen us?

07:16.513 --> 07:17.681
Okay.

07:29.126 --> 07:32.062
This doesn't make any sense.
Just reroute me.

08:03.826 --> 08:06.396
Yes!
Suck it, phone!

09:19.234 --> 09:21.567
You need some help there, miss?

09:21.569 --> 09:24.370
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I'm just stretching my legs.

09:24.372 --> 09:26.374
Yeah. And your map.

09:28.843 --> 09:31.210
Right. I'm just getting
my bearings.

09:31.212 --> 09:32.811
Yeah, we seen you up
there and thought

09:32.813 --> 09:35.548
maybe you was having
some sort of trouble.

09:35.550 --> 09:38.417
Oh, no. I'm... I'm just passing
through.

09:38.419 --> 09:40.652
You sure you're okay?

09:40.654 --> 09:42.622
You look a little upset.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.490
And these woods,
they can be a crazy place

09:44.492 --> 09:45.993
especially
if you ain't familiar.

09:47.529 --> 09:50.496
I guess I'm a little frustrated,
you know.

09:50.498 --> 09:52.233
These maps aren't super useful.

09:53.867 --> 09:58.203
Ain't that the truth.

09:58.205 --> 10:00.473
So... so that's it then?

10:00.475 --> 10:04.009
You're just a tourist passing
through here?

10:04.011 --> 10:08.146
Yeah? Well shit, if it's directions
you're looking for, me and Buck..

10:08.148 --> 10:11.082
That's my brother Buck there.

10:11.084 --> 10:14.054
We lived here our whole lives.
So we can get you most anywhere.

10:15.489 --> 10:19.424
Uh, well, um, do you know
the best way back to 64?

10:19.426 --> 10:21.326
I-64?

10:22.462 --> 10:24.029
That's quite a ways.

10:24.031 --> 10:26.231
You're lucky you ran into us.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.666
Yeah.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.534
'Cause there ain't but a couple
roads run through these hills

10:29.536 --> 10:33.771
and well, you know, you got
yourself turned around nowhere.

10:33.773 --> 10:36.907
Alright. See here? Right here.

10:36.909 --> 10:39.544
You just keep on this way

10:39.546 --> 10:42.214
and you'll make yourself
back to the highway, okay.

10:42.216 --> 10:44.382
But you'll be backtracking
quite a bit.

10:44.384 --> 10:46.750
Well, guess I'm taking
the scenic route.

10:46.752 --> 10:50.754
Yeah. I guess you are.

10:54.628 --> 10:55.928
Alright.

11:01.801 --> 11:05.135
Oh, hey, hey!
Almost forgot. Your map.

11:05.137 --> 11:07.073
Oh, thanks.

11:11.644 --> 11:14.445
Say, you won't make it anywhere
before sundown

11:14.447 --> 11:16.313
and we live just up a ways.

11:16.315 --> 11:18.582
So how about you come on over
for some dinner?

11:18.584 --> 11:21.153
- Holli, shouldn't we just...
- Oh, he ain't going anywhere.

11:24.991 --> 11:26.626
What do you say?

11:28.728 --> 11:30.394
Thanks, but I really should be
getting going, so...

11:30.396 --> 11:34.098
No.. That... that... that might
not be the best idea.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.934
I mean, you got lost driving around
here and that was in broad daylight.

11:37.936 --> 11:40.439
And you don't wanna be out here
after dark, trust me.

11:43.008 --> 11:44.974
Listen, no offense, but you are
starting to make me feel

11:44.976 --> 11:47.444
very uncomfortable right now.

11:47.446 --> 11:49.613
Is that a fact?

11:49.615 --> 11:52.115
Well, listen, we just want you
to, uh... uh, be comfortable.

11:52.117 --> 11:53.783
That's all we want.

11:53.785 --> 11:56.419
And it's gonna get real cold
out here real quick.

11:56.421 --> 11:58.589
So why don't you just
come on back up to our place?

11:58.591 --> 12:01.090
We'll have a drink or two

12:01.092 --> 12:03.993
maybe, you know,
smoke a little somethin'?

12:03.995 --> 12:05.397
It'd be like a little party.

12:06.766 --> 12:09.065
Yeah? Come on, let's all..

12:21.012 --> 12:23.546
Goddamn! Bitch cut me!

12:23.548 --> 12:25.981
Yah!

12:25.983 --> 12:28.685
- Now hold on a second, honey.
- Fuck off!

12:28.687 --> 12:30.622
Get that knife away from her!

12:45.370 --> 12:47.572
She's gettin' away.

14:13.356 --> 14:15.122
That way. That way.

14:15.124 --> 14:17.427
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

15:10.912 --> 15:13.849
Okay.
I can figure this out.

15:17.385 --> 15:18.718
Yeah.

15:21.890 --> 15:23.558
Definitely.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.066
Shit!

16:22.449 --> 16:24.283
It's going to be fine.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.922
Everything's going to be fine.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.418
Fording County Sheriff's Office,
Deputy Katz speaking.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.754
Hold on.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.323
Sheriff, line one.

17:39.826 --> 17:40.891
This is O'Doyle.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.225
<i>Hey, sheriff</i>

17:42.227 --> 17:44.160
<i>this is Penny
from the Charleston office.</i>

17:44.162 --> 17:45.963
<i>I have a stranded vehicle
report</i>

17:45.965 --> 17:47.932
<i>for that two-five-oh
county road.</i>

17:47.934 --> 17:49.699
<i>If we could get
your registration report</i>

17:49.701 --> 17:52.268
<i>as soon as possible, our office
is gonna be closed</i>

17:52.270 --> 17:54.071
<i>due to the holiday.</i>

17:54.073 --> 17:56.439
Penny, could you, uh, could you
hold on a minute, honey?

17:56.441 --> 17:57.507
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

17:57.509 --> 17:58.541
What she want?

17:58.543 --> 17:59.976
<i>Uh, just an abandoned car.</i>

17:59.978 --> 18:01.978
Uh, it got me thinking.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.280
That, uh, hanging fella,
the Hispanic.

18:04.282 --> 18:06.216
- What's his name?
- That's Edwin Garro.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.617
Yeah, yeah, that Garro fella.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.353
We should see if he had any
vehicles registered in his name.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.722
Check them against
abandon vehicle reports.

18:12.724 --> 18:13.990
You think this might be his car?

18:13.992 --> 18:16.158
No, no, timeline's all wrong

18:16.160 --> 18:19.095
but maybe something got
picked up last week.

18:19.097 --> 18:23.265
Uh, it's a long shot, but,
you know, due diligence and all.

18:23.267 --> 18:25.669
I'm on it.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.737
Hello, Penny.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.575
Uh, so you say it's up
on 250, huh?

20:32.762 --> 20:34.228
Hey!

20:56.952 --> 20:59.220
Okay.

21:10.065 --> 21:13.399
Hey! Over here!
Help!

21:13.401 --> 21:14.670
Ah.

21:20.075 --> 21:21.442
Ow.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.939
Phew!

21:56.245 --> 21:58.577
<i>Well, dangit!</i>

21:58.579 --> 22:00.112
You're just as quiet
as a cottonmouth

22:00.114 --> 22:01.413
when you wanna be, huh?

22:01.415 --> 22:03.082
You here on official business,
sheriff

22:03.084 --> 22:06.218
or this is just a social call?

22:06.220 --> 22:09.555
I ain't here to take a bunch of
lip, you can count on that.

22:09.557 --> 22:11.557
I got a call
about an abandoned vehicle

22:11.559 --> 22:13.859
at the bend,
down by Rust Creek.

22:13.861 --> 22:16.829
Well, as you can see, we prefer
to abandon our vehicles

22:16.831 --> 22:18.264
right here at home.

22:18.266 --> 22:20.866
Well, I just seen you and Buck
tramplin' up from that creek

22:20.868 --> 22:22.768
every damn day, so, uh

22:22.770 --> 22:24.303
when I get a call
from the state police...

22:24.305 --> 22:27.206
State? What do the staties
gotta do with it?

22:27.208 --> 22:29.341
Nothing, yet.

22:29.343 --> 22:31.210
If we seen something
I'd tell you

22:31.212 --> 22:34.313
but the plain fact is
we weren't up there.

22:34.315 --> 22:36.115
Now you can come out here
puffing up your chest

22:36.117 --> 22:39.517
all you want,
but it don't change the facts.

22:39.519 --> 22:44.223
Boy, you must think I'm some
kinda a prize dummy, huh?

22:44.225 --> 22:45.757
Well I got news for you..

22:46.960 --> 22:49.594
Easy, sheriff!

22:49.596 --> 22:51.097
Jesus!

22:52.732 --> 22:56.069
You a bit, you a bit jumpy,
Quickdraw.

22:59.773 --> 23:01.041
You hurt there?

23:02.676 --> 23:04.742
Huntin' accident.

23:04.744 --> 23:06.476
Oh, you're bleeding right there.

23:06.478 --> 23:08.012
You should get that stitched up.

23:08.014 --> 23:10.447
It's just a scratch.

23:10.449 --> 23:12.817
Did you get that scratch
up by Rust Creek?

23:12.819 --> 23:14.688
Like I said..

23:16.890 --> 23:18.524
...we ain't been up there
in days.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.596
Alright, well..

23:26.598 --> 23:28.366
I tried.

23:28.368 --> 23:29.802
I tried.

24:04.536 --> 24:05.871
Ah.

25:56.446 --> 25:58.081
Oh, shit!

26:14.231 --> 26:16.933
Ow. Good as new.

26:27.577 --> 26:29.246
Everything's fine.

26:32.715 --> 26:34.584
Somebody will see the car..

26:38.120 --> 26:39.955
They'll find me here.

26:50.799 --> 26:52.701
I'm in the fucking woods.

29:27.421 --> 29:30.522
<i>Whoo! Holy shit!</i>

29:30.524 --> 29:33.625
- <i>Ha-ha-ha!</i>
- <i>That was amazing!</i>

29:33.627 --> 29:35.729
<i>That shit was amazing!</i>

29:36.962 --> 29:38.962
<i>Did you see that fucker fly?</i>

29:42.636 --> 29:44.803
<i>Come on, Buck.
Let's go check it out!</i>

30:02.455 --> 30:05.356
Ho-ly shit.

30:05.358 --> 30:09.560
Will you look at this? We
bull's-eyed a goddamn oak tree!

30:13.199 --> 30:15.666
They ain't never gonna send
nobody this far off road.

30:15.668 --> 30:18.968
Ah, shit. Now all we gotta do is
find that bitch.

30:18.970 --> 30:21.305
She was cut pretty deep, Holli.

30:21.307 --> 30:23.407
She ain't gonna last
out here too long.

30:23.409 --> 30:24.641
Can't we just go back...

30:24.643 --> 30:25.975
Not until they find a body
we're gonna have

30:25.977 --> 30:28.144
O'Doyle and the staties
up our asses, Buck.

30:28.146 --> 30:30.848
But if they find her, won't they
be all over the place anyway?

30:30.850 --> 30:32.415
No, not all over.

30:32.417 --> 30:35.017
Just around where they find
the body.

30:35.019 --> 30:36.587
Get it? Good.

30:36.589 --> 30:38.321
Come on,
we'll start at the creek

30:38.323 --> 30:40.657
work our way back down the road.

30:40.659 --> 30:43.459
- Fuck.
- Move your fat ass. This way.

30:43.461 --> 30:45.695
<i>Let's go.</i>

30:45.697 --> 30:47.766
<i>Come on, now watch your steps
there, Buck.</i>

31:36.313 --> 31:38.248
Oh, my God!

31:39.818 --> 31:42.717
Oh.

31:52.262 --> 31:53.630
Come on.

32:09.279 --> 32:10.781
Ain't even dry.

32:21.057 --> 32:22.992
Come on.

32:26.128 --> 32:27.764
Come on.

33:15.878 --> 33:17.813
Oh, come on.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.621
Come on.

33:27.957 --> 33:29.324
There.

35:08.922 --> 35:10.922
Mom.

35:10.924 --> 35:15.095
Uh, if you ever get this
somehow, I..

35:19.599 --> 35:21.668
...I wanted you to know that..

35:26.205 --> 35:27.238
...I... I should..

37:21.685 --> 37:23.088
Who are you?

37:25.523 --> 37:26.724
Oh, my God.

37:32.830 --> 37:34.765
What are you doing out here?

39:45.594 --> 39:47.529
God!

39:49.364 --> 39:51.998
Who the fuck are you?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.233
You were supposed to drink that.

39:53.235 --> 39:55.735
Stay the hell away from me.

39:55.737 --> 39:58.707
Put that down. Put that down.

40:03.812 --> 40:07.546
Take another step and I'll throw
this in your fucking face.

40:07.548 --> 40:09.382
- Careful now. That's my..
- I'm serious, motherfucker!

40:09.384 --> 40:10.785
I'll burn your fucking face off!

40:25.666 --> 40:27.666
What the fuck..

40:56.596 --> 40:58.831
- Hey! What was all that about?
- Hey.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.265
Oh, just sheriff stuff.

41:00.267 --> 41:01.799
Did you ask them about that SUV?

41:01.801 --> 41:05.371
Um, I didn't know you were
taking on "The Big SUV Case."

41:05.373 --> 41:08.706
I... I'm just curious. You know,
d... did they have an alibi?

41:08.708 --> 41:10.376
Alibi for... for what?

41:10.378 --> 41:12.111
For whatever was going on
with that SUV.

41:12.113 --> 41:14.446
Nick, do you, do you have such
an abundance of free time

41:14.448 --> 41:17.048
that you need to invent crimes
to investigate

41:17.050 --> 41:18.150
just to stave off the boredom?

41:18.152 --> 41:19.418
No, sir, I just...

41:19.420 --> 41:21.919
Because if you do,
I would love someone to tackle

41:21.921 --> 41:23.755
"The Case of the Moving
Violations Paperwork

41:23.757 --> 41:25.592
That's Backed Up to Early
October."

41:28.094 --> 41:29.729
Point taken, sheriff.

41:37.103 --> 41:40.104
But that SUV thing, I mean,
doesn't that seem odd to you?

41:40.106 --> 41:43.041
A vehicle like that, abandoned,
in the middle of the day

41:43.043 --> 41:45.810
no driver in sight?

41:45.812 --> 41:47.211
Are you second guessing me, son?

41:47.213 --> 41:48.946
No, sir. But..

41:51.317 --> 41:52.684
Speak plain.

41:54.254 --> 41:58.289
You do have
a way of treating the locals

41:58.291 --> 41:59.723
with a certain deference.

41:59.725 --> 42:03.560
Nick... you're a good deputy.

42:03.562 --> 42:05.063
You're a good man.

42:05.065 --> 42:07.432
I appreciate your commitment.

42:07.434 --> 42:09.933
So I'm just gonna say this
one time

42:09.935 --> 42:11.703
and I think it oughta be enough.

42:13.206 --> 42:15.373
Chief.

42:15.375 --> 42:16.909
Indian.

42:18.511 --> 42:19.845
<i>Mind your place.</i>

42:21.180 --> 42:23.847
And, uh, as far as them
Pritcherts are concerned

42:23.849 --> 42:26.149
I've been arrestin' them boys
since they were in grade school.

42:26.151 --> 42:28.685
And they are trouble,
that's for sure

42:28.687 --> 42:30.720
but they ain't got the brains

42:30.722 --> 42:32.457
between the two of 'em
to be dangerous.

42:32.459 --> 42:36.159
And moreover,
that mysterious SUV

42:36.161 --> 42:39.429
moved along some time yesterday.

42:39.431 --> 42:42.399
- Oh.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

42:42.401 --> 42:44.034
Oh.

42:44.036 --> 42:45.102
Yeah.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.003
Likely just run out of gas then?

42:47.005 --> 42:48.538
Likely.

42:48.540 --> 42:49.575
Oh.

42:50.576 --> 42:51.609
Okay.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.812
Say, sheriff,
do you have any objection to me

42:56.814 --> 42:58.148
calling the registered owner?

42:58.150 --> 43:00.683
You know, just to put
this whole thing to bed?

43:00.685 --> 43:03.652
Uh, if it'll give you some peace
of mind, son

43:03.654 --> 43:05.522
go right on ahead.

43:05.524 --> 43:06.691
Right.

43:27.446 --> 43:29.380
Eat this.

43:54.639 --> 43:57.241
Uh-uh. Knock it off.

44:02.079 --> 44:03.481
You lost blood.

44:04.748 --> 44:06.681
You need to eat.

44:06.683 --> 44:08.452
I need a hospital
and the police.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.621
Eat.

44:17.928 --> 44:19.863
Suit yourself.

45:22.992 --> 45:24.628
What's your name?

45:36.538 --> 45:38.007
I'm Sawyer.

45:42.678 --> 45:44.913
- <i>Sawyer Scott.</i>
- Shut up and eat.

45:48.150 --> 45:50.419
I go to Centre College.
I'm a senior.

45:51.819 --> 45:55.222
I was on my way to DC
for a this big job interview

45:55.224 --> 45:57.626
and my stupid GPS got me lost.

46:08.537 --> 46:10.472
These two guys jumped me.

46:18.946 --> 46:21.049
I'm sure my friends
are worried about me.

46:25.853 --> 46:27.286
<i>And my parents..</i>

46:27.288 --> 46:29.422
Quiet.

46:29.424 --> 46:30.724
<i>...and if you could
just untie me</i>

46:30.726 --> 46:31.857
<i>and take me to the police,
you'd be a hero.</i>

46:31.859 --> 46:33.192
Shh.

46:33.194 --> 46:35.161
I wouldn't even mention the..

46:35.163 --> 46:36.431
This.

46:38.299 --> 46:40.001
Might even be a reward.

46:48.676 --> 46:52.146
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

46:54.182 --> 46:57.452
If they find you here
they'll kill you.

46:59.019 --> 47:01.289
Keep quiet,
or I can't help you.

47:28.949 --> 47:31.416
There he is.

47:31.418 --> 47:34.855
Serious as ever.
Hello, cuz.

47:35.555 --> 47:38.158
Hollister. Buck.

47:38.924 --> 47:40.058
What happened here?

47:40.060 --> 47:42.262
Aw, just some horseplay.
You know.

47:43.430 --> 47:45.196
Sorry we ain't been up
to visit more.

47:45.198 --> 47:47.232
Things just been
kinda crazy lately.

47:47.234 --> 47:49.367
- Okay.
- No, no, it ain't.

47:49.369 --> 47:53.671
We're family.
No excuse. You know.

47:53.673 --> 47:57.207
- So, how'd the last batch go?
- No problems.

47:57.209 --> 47:59.511
<i>And the yield was what
we thought it would be?</i>

47:59.513 --> 48:00.845
<i>More or less.</i>

48:00.847 --> 48:02.913
<i>So we should be on target
for S... Saturday?</i>

48:02.915 --> 48:04.883
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

48:04.885 --> 48:08.051
<i>I get low on sudo
and some other stuff.</i>

48:08.053 --> 48:09.486
<i>We're all set with that.</i>

48:09.488 --> 48:11.355
<i>We'll be back up tomorrow
with more sudo, ammonia,</i>

48:11.357 --> 48:12.389
<i>matches, whatever.</i>

48:12.391 --> 48:13.424
<i>I'm good on ammonia</i>

48:13.426 --> 48:16.393
<i>but I'm gonna need more lye.</i>

48:16.395 --> 48:18.830
<i>You burned through that shit
pretty fast, didn't you?</i>

48:18.832 --> 48:21.835
Well, hell.
What Lowell wants, Lowell gets.

48:24.871 --> 48:26.470
Ask him about the girl, Holli.

48:26.472 --> 48:28.639
Oh, yeah, about that.

48:28.641 --> 48:32.109
Seems some girl went missing up
here a couple days ago

48:32.111 --> 48:34.178
and Sheriff O'Doyle

48:34.180 --> 48:37.181
he nearly crawled up
our ass about it.

48:37.183 --> 48:39.118
I don't suppose
you seen anything?

48:40.085 --> 48:41.652
I ain't seen no girl.

48:41.654 --> 48:43.921
Okay. Do you mind
if we take a look around?

48:43.923 --> 48:46.358
- <i>Free country.</i>
- <i>Yeah. It is at that.</i>

49:06.211 --> 49:07.312
<i>Nothin'.</i>

49:12.250 --> 49:14.283
What's eatin' you?

49:14.285 --> 49:17.086
Tell me, cousin

49:17.088 --> 49:18.922
how many times me
and Buck been up here

49:18.924 --> 49:21.892
since we got
this trailer set up?

49:21.894 --> 49:23.326
Dozen or so.

49:23.328 --> 49:24.962
And every time we do,
uh, I mean

49:24.964 --> 49:27.029
hell, even Buck
could tell you.

49:27.031 --> 49:28.564
What's the first thing
that we do?

49:28.566 --> 49:30.668
Go in and have a beer.

49:31.536 --> 49:32.935
<i>Right.</i>

49:32.937 --> 49:34.537
Right.

49:34.539 --> 49:35.972
But today when we come up here

49:35.974 --> 49:37.473
<i>and you step outside to meet us</i>

49:37.475 --> 49:39.242
<i>and stand there the whole time</i>

49:39.244 --> 49:42.245
in the middle
of the fucking rain

49:42.247 --> 49:45.182
<i>like you're some kinda
goddamn guard dog.</i>

49:57.060 --> 49:58.494
<i>You got something to say?</i>

49:58.496 --> 50:00.097
<i>I think I'm saying it.</i>

50:02.600 --> 50:04.967
<i>We tracked that girl
up here yesterday.</i>

50:04.969 --> 50:07.237
Trail went cold
not a hundred yards away.

50:11.141 --> 50:14.476
You found yourself
some fun, didn't you?

50:14.478 --> 50:16.344
Didn't you, huh?

50:18.148 --> 50:20.317
I had a accident
with the lye is all.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.620
Place is full of fumes.

50:27.157 --> 50:28.425
Lowell..

50:30.460 --> 50:32.460
...it hurts my feelings
when you treat me

50:32.462 --> 50:34.731
like I'm some kind
of goddamn idiot.

50:36.900 --> 50:39.334
Now, how about
we go on inside

50:39.336 --> 50:40.837
and have a look.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.260
She ain't in there.

51:25.181 --> 51:26.115
Oh..

52:54.268 --> 52:55.434
You shouldn't be here.

52:55.436 --> 52:56.903
You're hurting me.

52:56.905 --> 52:58.672
Better me than them.

53:00.175 --> 53:03.508
Next time
I tell you to stay put

53:03.510 --> 53:05.011
you stay put!

53:26.700 --> 53:28.633
- Suicide?
- Yeah.

53:28.635 --> 53:30.068
So you think
it's just coincidence

53:30.070 --> 53:32.671
that this Hispanic fella
from out of town

53:32.673 --> 53:35.207
offed himself right when
we got Mexican drugs

53:35.209 --> 53:36.541
flooding the state?

53:36.543 --> 53:37.943
I... I couldn't say.

53:37.945 --> 53:40.979
But in Fording County

53:40.981 --> 53:43.181
suicide seems to make
a lot more sense

53:43.183 --> 53:46.084
than some cartel gang thing.

53:46.086 --> 53:48.653
Maybe. That doesn't
sound right to me.

53:48.655 --> 53:50.287
So, we gonna wait
on the coroner.

53:50.289 --> 53:53.024
Now also, Penny from Dispatch
wanted me to follow up

53:53.026 --> 53:54.258
on an abandoned vehicle.

53:54.260 --> 53:57.229
Oh! That wasn't nothin'.
Moved on the same day.

53:57.231 --> 53:59.231
Oh, well, uh..

53:59.233 --> 54:01.099
Well, you got something
to add, deputy?

54:01.101 --> 54:02.833
Uh..

54:02.835 --> 54:04.236
Go on, Katz.

54:04.238 --> 54:07.271
That vehicle was registered
to a couple over in Paducah

54:07.273 --> 54:08.405
but they gave
it to their daughter.

54:08.407 --> 54:09.440
Now, she's over...

54:09.442 --> 54:11.308
Why don't you
just get to the part

54:11.310 --> 54:13.213
where you tell us the bad news.

54:14.947 --> 54:17.948
The driver's name
is, uh, Sawyer Scott

54:17.950 --> 54:21.552
and apparently nobody seems
to know where she is at.

54:21.554 --> 54:22.820
She's missing?

54:22.822 --> 54:24.622
Well, her roommates
said that she was going home

54:24.624 --> 54:26.590
for Thanksgiving,
but her folks said

54:26.592 --> 54:28.092
that she was staying
on campus.

54:28.094 --> 54:30.027
When was the last time
she was seen?

54:30.029 --> 54:31.962
Monday morning.

54:31.964 --> 54:33.264
Monday morning?

54:33.266 --> 54:34.965
I... I just got off the phone
with the mother

54:34.967 --> 54:38.569
and she said that the girl's
not answering her phone.

54:38.571 --> 54:41.404
Look, that was before you send
out your storm troopers

54:41.406 --> 54:43.741
start trampling out
people's flower beds

54:43.743 --> 54:45.709
and kicking down their doors.

54:45.711 --> 54:47.812
Let's just make sure
she's not

54:47.814 --> 54:50.114
passed out
in Virginia Beach somewhere.

54:50.116 --> 54:53.050
Jesus Christ, O'Doyle

54:53.052 --> 54:55.652
you think I enjoy
doing your job for you?

54:55.654 --> 54:58.122
I'm not about to send my men
traipsing through the woods

54:58.124 --> 55:00.057
on Thanksgiving
if I don't have to.

55:00.059 --> 55:02.927
<i>But you better get a line
on this girl soon</i>

55:02.929 --> 55:04.794
or you gonna have
state police choppers

55:04.796 --> 55:07.233
<i>blocking out
the sun down here.</i>

55:09.467 --> 55:11.736
- Deputy.
- Sir.

55:16.608 --> 55:18.211
- Sorry, sheriff...
- Save it.

55:19.644 --> 55:22.080
We got a picture
of this missing girl?

55:31.022 --> 55:33.357
Pretty clever how you
burned through them ropes.

55:36.228 --> 55:38.462
- <i>What is that stuff?</i>
- Lye.

55:39.598 --> 55:41.867
- Is that some kind of acid?
- <i>Base.</i>

55:42.767 --> 55:44.067
Burns like acid.

55:44.069 --> 55:45.737
Bases burn too.

55:47.538 --> 55:50.139
And the milk,
that neutralized it?

55:50.141 --> 55:52.708
Milk ain't acid enough
to neutralize lye.

55:52.710 --> 55:54.843
You'd need something like..

55:54.845 --> 55:57.080
...like vinegar
to neutralize lye.

55:57.082 --> 56:00.449
So why don't you have
some vinegar handy?

56:00.451 --> 56:04.453
<i>You know what happens when
you mix an acid with a base?</i>

56:04.455 --> 56:06.688
Neutralizes it?

56:06.690 --> 56:09.024
Yeah, with so much heat

56:09.026 --> 56:11.526
it burn you worse
than the lye did.

56:11.528 --> 56:13.464
Thought you were
a college girl.

56:15.633 --> 56:17.735
I'm not a chemistry major.

56:35.653 --> 56:37.420
Well, that's why milk's better.

56:38.621 --> 56:40.190
Less reaction.

56:42.458 --> 56:44.194
Still burned quite a bit,
thank you.

56:45.362 --> 56:47.528
Why do you know
so much about this stuff?

56:47.530 --> 56:50.301
I've been cooking meth
since I was 14 years old.

56:51.936 --> 56:54.537
You learn real quick
what all can burn you.

57:00.677 --> 57:02.279
You know..

57:03.780 --> 57:07.050
...if you let me go
I won't tell them anything.

57:10.053 --> 57:13.454
You say you're trying to help
me, but you're holding me here.

57:13.456 --> 57:15.324
Can't do it.

57:15.326 --> 57:18.526
I promise I won't
tell anyone anything.

57:18.528 --> 57:19.727
If you just let me go.

57:19.729 --> 57:22.563
We're five miles
from the nearest road.

57:22.565 --> 57:25.766
Twenty from any kind of town.

57:25.768 --> 57:27.635
I got no car.

57:27.637 --> 57:30.204
<i>You wouldn't make it a
100 yards the shape you're in.</i>

57:30.206 --> 57:32.907
And even if you did,
the first person you met

57:32.909 --> 57:35.910
would like as not hand you
right over to Hollister.

57:35.912 --> 57:37.445
Bullshit.

57:37.447 --> 57:39.981
- You just wanna keep me here.
- Quit it.

57:39.983 --> 57:41.514
You can't keep me here forever!

57:41.516 --> 57:43.119
I said quit it.

57:49.192 --> 57:51.827
You wanna try your luck out
in them woods, go on.

57:58.368 --> 58:01.803
Hollister and Buck are going
into Charleston this weekend.

58:03.339 --> 58:05.206
They'll leave their truck
at their mama's house.

58:05.208 --> 58:07.109
I'll go down on Saturday
and I'll borrow it.

58:09.011 --> 58:10.746
And then I'll take you
someplace safe.

58:12.482 --> 58:13.949
Out of Fording County.

58:34.269 --> 58:36.469
I might need some help with
this one, heavy as a mother..

58:41.043 --> 58:44.177
Jesus Christ! O'Doyle?

58:44.179 --> 58:47.180
I got some plain
questions for you

58:47.182 --> 58:48.849
and I want some plain answers.

58:50.152 --> 58:52.818
- Is this about that car?
- Hell with the car.

58:52.820 --> 58:56.156
Now, I got the state police
asking about a missing girl!

58:56.158 --> 58:57.756
We did what you told us,
sheriff.

58:57.758 --> 58:59.591
Son, if you'd done
what I told you

58:59.593 --> 59:01.093
they would've found
that girl's body

59:01.095 --> 59:03.896
somewhere down
in Jonesboro County by now.

59:03.898 --> 59:05.398
I still don't know
what the hell

59:05.400 --> 59:06.565
you dimwits were thinking.

59:06.567 --> 59:08.967
I told you,
okay, she come up on us

59:08.969 --> 59:10.302
when we was burying
that bag of shit.

59:10.304 --> 59:11.570
And we thought she seen
somethin'!

59:11.572 --> 59:13.972
Well, she seen something now.

59:13.974 --> 59:15.307
At this point, don't it figure
she already

59:15.309 --> 59:16.809
out there in them woods
froze to death?

59:16.811 --> 59:19.111
It don't matter if she's out
there dead in a gully

59:19.113 --> 59:20.913
or singin' on Bandstand.

59:20.915 --> 59:23.615
Without a body, these woods

59:23.617 --> 59:25.517
is gonna be crawling
with state police.

59:25.519 --> 59:29.855
Well, she ain't been found,
okay? So, she's likely dead.

59:29.857 --> 59:33.292
The birds will be at her by now.
She'll be easier to spot.

59:33.294 --> 59:35.060
We'll go out again tomorrow

59:35.062 --> 59:37.463
after we run this stuff
up to Lowell.

59:37.465 --> 59:39.932
How's your cousin doing?

59:39.934 --> 59:42.034
Weird.
Like, I don't even know him.

59:42.036 --> 59:45.471
What I meant was,
are we still on schedule?

59:45.473 --> 59:47.738
Hell, you know that ol' boy
don't do nothin' but cook.

59:47.740 --> 59:51.110
Big batch here,
but we'll be right by Saturday.

59:51.112 --> 59:52.679
We'd better be.

01:00:12.365 --> 01:00:14.634
Breakfast is peaches
or bologna.

01:00:18.238 --> 01:00:19.770
What are you doing?

01:00:19.772 --> 01:00:22.306
Cuttin' matchbooks.

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:24.676
- What for?
- Cook meth.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.847
I thought meth
was made from, like..

01:00:29.849 --> 01:00:32.116
...ephedrine and Drano.

01:00:32.118 --> 01:00:33.119
And matchbooks.

01:00:34.287 --> 01:00:36.220
Why are you making meth?

01:00:36.222 --> 01:00:38.158
Isn't everyone doing
heroin now?

01:00:43.196 --> 01:00:45.797
- I read.
- Can't cook heroin.

01:00:50.035 --> 01:00:52.637
How many of them do you need?

01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:54.070
Lots.

01:00:54.072 --> 01:00:56.106
And what do you do
when you have them all cut up?

01:00:56.108 --> 01:00:58.911
- Mix that shit in.
- What's that shit?

01:01:00.212 --> 01:01:03.880
Why do you ask so many
damn questions?

01:01:03.882 --> 01:01:05.516
Never mind.

01:01:05.518 --> 01:01:07.286
Just thought I might
learn something.

01:01:09.556 --> 01:01:11.721
So..

01:01:11.723 --> 01:01:14.625
...you don't really know
what you're doing.

01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:16.661
You're like one of those
European pop bands

01:01:16.663 --> 01:01:18.995
that sing in English
but don't actually know

01:01:18.997 --> 01:01:20.297
what any of the lyrics mean.

01:01:20.299 --> 01:01:22.399
You sure ride high

01:01:22.401 --> 01:01:24.067
<i>for a girl
who jammed her wet hands</i>

01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:26.970
in a bucketful of lye yesterday.

01:01:26.972 --> 01:01:29.239
I wasn't being condescending.
I'm just saying.

01:01:29.241 --> 01:01:31.575
You know, it's amazing they got you
doing all this complex chemistry

01:01:31.577 --> 01:01:33.512
and you don't even
have to understand it.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.249
That ain't condescending?

01:01:39.884 --> 01:01:43.052
So... I've been thinking
about your plan

01:01:43.054 --> 01:01:44.389
to borrow your truck.

01:01:46.325 --> 01:01:50.025
I just don't know I should
stay up here for that long.

01:01:50.027 --> 01:01:51.461
I mean, it's okay
for a backup plan

01:01:51.463 --> 01:01:54.230
but, you know, if you can
get me to a phone, then...

01:01:54.232 --> 01:01:55.898
Bad idea.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.833
If I'm here when
those guys come back...

01:01:57.835 --> 01:02:02.104
It's safer to keep you here
than to try and move you.

01:02:02.106 --> 01:02:05.241
I'm not really
a sit and wait type.

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:07.076
You don't say.

01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:09.845
Listen, I just think I can come
up with a more proactive way to...

01:02:09.847 --> 01:02:11.782
Hey, would you hand me
that pitcher right there?

01:02:20.224 --> 01:02:23.961
- Why is it so cold?
- Just pour it in here.

01:02:25.696 --> 01:02:27.298
<i>Real slow.</i>

01:02:32.436 --> 01:02:35.872
It's cold 'cause the acetone
inside, it's evaporating..

01:02:37.608 --> 01:02:41.343
...sucking away the energy
from what all it's touchin'.

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:45.314
Mix that with the matchbooks,
separate the red phosphorous.

01:02:45.316 --> 01:02:47.383
Then I'm gonna mix that
with iodine

01:02:47.385 --> 01:02:51.387
to get hydroiodic acid,
which I need to cook meth.

01:02:51.389 --> 01:02:54.789
So you do all that
for just one ingredient?

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:56.592
That's the job.

01:02:56.594 --> 01:02:59.193
Like a bunch of little
science projects?

01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:02.598
Combine this ingredient,
separate that one.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:07.268
Yeah, and just about every one
of them will kill you.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.837
Every one of 'em
is either corrosive

01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:11.675
flammable, both.

01:03:13.276 --> 01:03:16.711
Methanol, acetone,
glycol, butane..

01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:18.648
You thought
that lye was tough.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.189
We used to cook with this.

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:30.291
Anhydrous ammonia.

01:03:30.293 --> 01:03:33.161
In here it's just a liquid

01:03:33.163 --> 01:03:35.797
that'll burn your skin
right off.

01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:38.466
Room temp, it turns
into poison gas.

01:03:38.468 --> 01:03:40.637
One spark..

01:03:56.919 --> 01:03:58.854
Hollister will be here soon.

01:04:24.179 --> 01:04:26.881
- Oh, God.
- Lowell.

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:30.051
Low-ell.

01:04:31.553 --> 01:04:34.788
Low-ell. Low-ell.

01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:36.790
L-O-L.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.496
L-O-L. Get it?

01:04:54.777 --> 01:04:57.245
Hey, L-O-L!

01:05:00.816 --> 01:05:01.983
Where you at?

01:05:08.122 --> 01:05:10.823
- Hey.
- Just put that down there.

01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:14.894
- Eh, what's cooking, Lowell?
- Try not to breathe.

01:05:14.896 --> 01:05:18.930
- Shouldn't we get masks?
- But I just got the one.

01:05:18.932 --> 01:05:22.737
- Best unload quick.
- Jesus Christ.

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:44.690
Thought you were gonna wait
around back of the trailer.

01:05:44.692 --> 01:05:46.926
<i>What if Hollister
had come down here?</i>

01:05:46.928 --> 01:05:48.696
<i>Or Buck?</i>

01:05:49.963 --> 01:05:52.497
What if they'd come
behind the trailer?

01:05:52.499 --> 01:05:56.234
<i>Well, I could have
kept 'em from there.</i>

01:05:56.236 --> 01:05:58.171
<i>You gotta learn to sit still.</i>

01:05:59.807 --> 01:06:04.609
So, that road I came from
is, is that way?

01:06:04.611 --> 01:06:06.546
And that little town
is that way?

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.151
Yeah, that's Boone.

01:06:12.185 --> 01:06:13.918
But the nearest road
is Bishop

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.923
that way, to the east.

01:06:18.692 --> 01:06:20.627
<i>You fixing to make
a break for it?</i>

01:06:30.135 --> 01:06:31.905
Your call.

01:06:33.773 --> 01:06:36.375
<i>But if you're just restless,
I can put you to work.</i>

01:06:51.658 --> 01:06:54.759
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:56.226
I know what I said but..

01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:57.694
Baby, this girl
is still out there

01:06:57.696 --> 01:07:00.065
and her mama's been callin',
just worried sick.

01:07:01.367 --> 01:07:03.100
We'll have plenty
of other Thanksgivings

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.801
but this girl won't
if we don't find her soon.

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.603
- Nick!
- Y... yes, sheriff?

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:09.673
What are you still doing here?
It's almost dinnertime.

01:07:09.675 --> 01:07:11.408
Well, I... I was just..
It's okay, I'm just..

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:13.310
No, no, the hell it is!

01:07:13.312 --> 01:07:14.811
It's your first
Thanksgiving together.

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.680
You go home have dinner
with your wife.

01:07:16.682 --> 01:07:18.515
- But if I don't finish...
- That's an order, deputy.

01:07:18.517 --> 01:07:21.251
I think I can muddle through
without you for an hour or two.

01:07:21.253 --> 01:07:23.420
Bring me back a plate.

01:07:23.422 --> 01:07:26.023
- Go! Go, go go!
- Okay. Okay.

01:07:26.025 --> 01:07:29.927
Thank you, sheriff. Uh, babe,
sheriff's sending me home for dinner.

01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:31.864
Just, uh, give me, give me 20.

01:07:37.603 --> 01:07:39.268
<i>You gotta speak up a bit.</i>

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:42.238
Yeah, I'm getting
in my cruiser right now.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.406
Whipped cream?

01:07:43.408 --> 01:07:45.074
No, baby, no stores
are gonna be open

01:07:45.076 --> 01:07:47.543
around here on Thanksgiving.

01:07:47.545 --> 01:07:50.546
Well, who says you need
whipped cream with pumpkin pie?

01:07:50.548 --> 01:07:52.783
No, I ain't driving all the..

01:07:52.785 --> 01:07:54.717
Oh, wait. Hang on, babe.

01:07:54.719 --> 01:07:57.153
I think I got
some cream in the office.

01:07:57.155 --> 01:07:59.090
I said I think I got some c..

01:08:00.091 --> 01:08:02.858
Jenna, my phone's about to die.

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.961
I'll be home soon.

01:08:04.963 --> 01:08:06.397
I love you too.

01:08:09.233 --> 01:08:12.068
<i>..tired of excuses, Hollister.</i>

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:16.104
<i>You come up with that fucking
girl's body, alright, or so he..</i>

01:08:16.106 --> 01:08:19.107
<i>Listen, this is
my goddamn retirement</i>

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:23.078
and if you screw it up,
believe me, you will not live

01:08:23.081 --> 01:08:25.081
long enough to regret it.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.770
Hey, Nick.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:52.707
Uh, look,
I... I can understand..

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:55.577
Just, you know, hearing
maybe half of that conversation

01:08:55.578 --> 01:08:57.712
it could be misconstrued.

01:08:57.714 --> 01:08:58.814
Right.

01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:05.687
Come on, really?

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:06.854
Nick, look..

01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:10.158
Well, let's just sit down
and talk about this.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.694
I can hear you just fine
from over here, sheriff.

01:09:12.696 --> 01:09:16.131
You're not even gonna give me
a chance to explain?

01:09:16.133 --> 01:09:17.233
I mean, I..

01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:26.375
Easy now.

01:09:28.645 --> 01:09:31.078
You'll have
your chance to explain.

01:09:31.081 --> 01:09:33.180
But right now
I'm walking out of here

01:09:33.182 --> 01:09:34.785
and you're not stoppin' me.

01:09:59.341 --> 01:10:01.444
It don't have
to be like this, Nick.

01:10:07.049 --> 01:10:08.949
I'm sorry, sheriff.

01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:10.951
But whatever you're into

01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:12.722
you're gonna
have to answer for it.

01:11:06.808 --> 01:11:09.642
Would you rather
have a room full of pennies

01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:12.580
or a stack of pennies as tall as
the Empire State Building?

01:11:17.485 --> 01:11:18.920
Never mind.

01:11:24.424 --> 01:11:27.526
- I'd rather have the stack.
- What?

01:11:27.528 --> 01:11:29.829
I'd rather have
the stack of pennies.

01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:31.099
Real tall.

01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:34.434
A stack isn't many.

01:11:36.303 --> 01:11:38.737
The Empire State Building's
like a 100 stories high.

01:11:38.739 --> 01:11:41.040
More than that
can fit in a closet.

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:43.775
If I had a stack
of pennies tall as that

01:11:43.777 --> 01:11:47.379
it'd be the most incredible
thing you ever saw.

01:11:47.381 --> 01:11:48.814
Right here, in the middle
of the Blue Ridge

01:11:48.816 --> 01:11:50.584
pennies to the sky..

01:11:51.752 --> 01:11:53.520
People'd come from miles.

01:12:01.495 --> 01:12:03.130
Hey, what day is it?

01:12:05.632 --> 01:12:06.900
Thursday.

01:12:09.069 --> 01:12:10.637
Thanksgiving.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.677
I guess you'd be
with your folks, huh?

01:12:18.278 --> 01:12:20.712
Actually,
I was ditchin' them this year

01:12:20.714 --> 01:12:22.649
for a stupid job interview.

01:12:26.954 --> 01:12:28.222
I know.

01:12:30.257 --> 01:12:32.525
And the worst part is
I didn't even tell them why.

01:12:34.694 --> 01:12:37.130
I was too embarrassed
in case I didn't get the job.

01:12:41.767 --> 01:12:44.037
All that scrambling around..

01:12:45.805 --> 01:12:47.241
...all my plans.

01:12:50.143 --> 01:12:52.078
What does is matter now?

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.847
My wife used to say

01:12:56.849 --> 01:13:00.017
"Man plans, God laughs."

01:13:01.854 --> 01:13:03.322
Yeah.

01:13:06.259 --> 01:13:08.361
Sounds like something
my mom would say.

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:13.132
Always talking about God's plan.

01:13:17.937 --> 01:13:19.872
Sure don't seem
like much of one.

01:13:21.807 --> 01:13:22.973
Sure don't.

01:13:29.382 --> 01:13:30.613
Bury him deep.

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:32.548
Don't just run him
out past that Sycamore Line

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:35.386
and kick some dirt
on him. You got it?

01:13:35.388 --> 01:13:37.720
- What about the girl?
- You still got her wallet?

01:13:37.722 --> 01:13:39.722
Mm-hm.

01:13:39.724 --> 01:13:42.458
Alright, I got an idea
how to keep the staties

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.893
off our ass,
for the weekend at least.

01:13:43.895 --> 01:13:45.830
But we still gotta find her.

01:13:47.499 --> 01:13:49.666
Do not talk like that, okay?

01:13:49.668 --> 01:13:50.833
Don't worry about it.

01:13:50.835 --> 01:13:53.102
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this, okay?

01:13:53.104 --> 01:13:55.372
I'm sure that,
uh, Nick is fine.

01:13:55.374 --> 01:13:58.375
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation..

01:13:58.377 --> 01:14:01.277
Hold on, I... I just, I'm in the
middle of something, alright?

01:14:01.279 --> 01:14:03.179
Uh, Jenna, uh..

01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:04.847
I'm gonna go right now
and take care of this.

01:14:04.849 --> 01:14:08.483
I will call you soon as I know
somethin'. I promise. Okay.

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:10.753
Bye.

01:14:10.755 --> 01:14:12.689
Jesus Christ

01:14:12.691 --> 01:14:14.657
I do not have time
for your foolishness

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:15.692
this morning, Douglas.

01:14:15.694 --> 01:14:18.227
My deputy is MIA.

01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:21.164
His wife's been calling me
non-stop all night.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:23.866
Between her
and Sawyer Scott's mother

01:14:23.868 --> 01:14:25.500
I... I cannot go five minutes

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:27.203
without an hysterical
phone call.

01:14:27.205 --> 01:14:30.073
- He been gone long?
- He, uh..

01:14:30.075 --> 01:14:32.342
He left here
yesterday afternoon

01:14:32.344 --> 01:14:36.578
nobody's seen him since.
I mean, I... I'm concerned.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.383
Well, good news is I'm here
to lighten your workload.

01:14:40.385 --> 01:14:41.783
I'm taking over
on that missing girl.

01:14:41.785 --> 01:14:44.354
Now, my team's heading up
here now to do a proper search

01:14:44.356 --> 01:14:47.425
of those woods up by Rust Creek
all the way through to Blackridge.

01:14:49.327 --> 01:14:51.827
Okay, well, it's no secret
I don't like that

01:14:51.829 --> 01:14:53.929
but, uh, I guess
it's for the best.

01:14:53.931 --> 01:14:55.831
Mm-hm.

01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:58.767
Got my own missing
person to deal with now.

01:14:58.769 --> 01:15:01.403
Okay, well, uh,
you just give me a minute

01:15:01.405 --> 01:15:02.971
I'll head out with you,
I'll debrief your men,

01:15:02.973 --> 01:15:04.373
and I'll catch 'em up
on what we know.

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.808
Look, that ain't gonna be
necessary. They got the report.

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:08.810
I got this girl's parents
comin' over from Paducah.

01:15:08.812 --> 01:15:10.447
I... it's fine, it'll just
be a minute.

01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:13.614
Just gonna check
Nick's locker here.

01:15:13.616 --> 01:15:16.151
See if he took his civvies with
him or if he's still in uniform.

01:15:16.153 --> 01:15:18.253
Really, O'Doyle,
we can handle it, alright?

01:15:18.255 --> 01:15:20.255
I appreciate the offer.

01:15:20.257 --> 01:15:22.725
Oh, what the hell..

01:15:25.828 --> 01:15:27.431
Oh, man.

01:15:32.036 --> 01:15:33.803
Well, I'll be goddamned.

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:48.517
Though we have not yet
determined the nature

01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:49.617
of the relationship

01:15:49.619 --> 01:15:52.119
we do believe that
Deputy Katz is involved

01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:53.988
in Scott's disappearance.

01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:56.991
His cruiser was found this
morning in Jonesboro County

01:15:56.993 --> 01:15:58.859
so it's a good bet
he's fleeing the state.

01:15:58.861 --> 01:16:00.828
So, we're going to extend
our search west

01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:02.565
<i>until we find this man.</i>

01:16:08.704 --> 01:16:10.603
Now what?

01:16:12.008 --> 01:16:13.443
That's it.

01:16:15.845 --> 01:16:17.610
In 20 minutes,
you'll be an official cook.

01:16:17.612 --> 01:16:20.780
- That ain't so hard.
- Ah!

01:16:20.782 --> 01:16:24.617
You think you can sit still
20 minutes?

01:16:24.619 --> 01:16:27.188
I don't know.

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.922
Well, I think I might be

01:16:28.924 --> 01:16:31.327
starting to get used
to the quiet country life.

01:16:47.909 --> 01:16:49.976
Inside.

01:16:49.978 --> 01:16:52.247
Stay by the back door.

01:16:53.516 --> 01:16:56.218
And if there's trouble... run.

01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:22.310
Hey there, son.

01:17:27.014 --> 01:17:29.783
- How's the cook?
- Fine.

01:17:31.051 --> 01:17:32.320
Hm.

01:17:33.754 --> 01:17:38.525
Well, I just thought I'd come
up here to check on ya.

01:17:38.527 --> 01:17:41.026
And you done it.

01:17:41.028 --> 01:17:42.796
That's close enough.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.001
Wh..

01:17:49.003 --> 01:17:51.305
What, you're giving orders now,
is that it?

01:17:53.642 --> 01:17:57.509
I just don't like nobody
disturbing my cook's all.

01:17:57.511 --> 01:17:58.979
Huh.

01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:07.254
Well, let me
tell you somethin'.

01:18:08.622 --> 01:18:10.989
I got a lot
invested in this here.

01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:14.193
<i>And, uh, if I wanna
go inside and take a look</i>

01:18:14.195 --> 01:18:16.197
<i>what y'all up to,
I'm gonna do that.</i>

01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:19.799
You ain't.

01:18:21.435 --> 01:18:23.370
You forget
who you're talking to?

01:18:25.573 --> 01:18:30.176
<i>I'm the chief,
you're the Indian.</i>

01:18:31.445 --> 01:18:34.379
My kitchen..

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:35.681
...my rules.

01:18:35.683 --> 01:18:37.784
You know, you ain't
the only cook around here.

01:18:42.789 --> 01:18:46.625
So, why don't you just
set that gun down and make nice?

01:18:54.734 --> 01:18:56.901
Don't kid yourself, boy.

01:18:56.903 --> 01:18:59.136
I could put two in you
before you could even

01:18:59.138 --> 01:19:01.872
get them barrels
up above your waist.

01:19:01.874 --> 01:19:05.144
Lucky for me you're standing
next to a drum full of ether.

01:19:10.016 --> 01:19:12.350
Too dangerous to keep inside.

01:19:12.352 --> 01:19:15.622
One spark from, say, some
buckshot hitting the metal..

01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:19.392
Hm.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.033
Wow.

01:19:30.035 --> 01:19:32.836
A Pritchert with some brains.

01:19:32.838 --> 01:19:34.607
Lord help us all.

01:19:36.275 --> 01:19:38.377
Alright, well..

01:19:40.846 --> 01:19:43.616
You just mind you get
this cook done right.

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:47.352
Next time I come up here..

01:19:48.587 --> 01:19:50.522
...I'll know where I stand.

01:20:33.532 --> 01:20:35.299
Was that your boss?

01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:40.504
He sounds like an asshole.

01:20:41.972 --> 01:20:45.541
He's the worst kind
of snake there is.

01:20:45.543 --> 01:20:47.311
Don't rattle before he bite.

01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:56.854
- Doesn't look like much.
- It'll do.

01:20:58.155 --> 01:21:00.091
How much more do we need?

01:21:01.826 --> 01:21:04.426
Nine, ten more cooks.

01:21:04.428 --> 01:21:06.228
That's gonna take all day.

01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:07.997
Best get to it then.

01:21:11.502 --> 01:21:13.235
But if you get asked,
just remember..

01:21:13.237 --> 01:21:15.604
Escorting a prisoner
for interview. I got it.

01:21:15.606 --> 01:21:17.206
Suspect.

01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:20.208
Escorting a suspect
for interview.

01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:21.710
Don't forget to shave.

01:21:21.712 --> 01:21:22.877
And keep him in the back seat.

01:21:22.879 --> 01:21:24.346
How come I gotta sit in back?

01:21:24.348 --> 01:21:26.548
On account of when'd you ever
see someone that wasn't police

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:27.716
riding in the front
of a police car?

01:21:27.718 --> 01:21:28.883
You ain't police.

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:31.219
That's why
he's got the uniform.

01:21:31.221 --> 01:21:32.554
Dangit!

01:21:32.556 --> 01:21:33.988
Now just remember,
don't give them anything

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.989
until you get the money.

01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:36.023
- I won't.
- You..

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:37.425
You count out
all that money, alright?

01:21:37.427 --> 01:21:38.827
Don't get lazy
and let 'em short you.

01:21:38.829 --> 01:21:40.328
Why don't you just come
do the thing yourself

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.396
if you're so damn nervous then,
huh?

01:21:41.398 --> 01:21:43.197
'Cause that's what
I got you for.

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:45.166
So don't screw it up. Alright?

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:47.803
We got one chance to show
these boys we can compete

01:21:47.805 --> 01:21:49.203
with them Mexicans.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:51.272
Lowell cooks glass twice
as good as any Mexican.

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:53.775
Yeah, well that's the only
reason he ain't in the ground.

01:21:53.777 --> 01:21:56.778
You know, he pulled
a shotgun on me today?

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.979
It's still burnin' me up.

01:21:57.981 --> 01:22:00.381
Yeah, he's been
real touchy lately.

01:22:00.383 --> 01:22:02.383
Don't even invite us in
for a drink no more.

01:22:04.721 --> 01:22:06.788
Alright, well, let's do this.

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:08.224
Alright.

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:11.325
I'mma go inside and change.

01:22:11.327 --> 01:22:13.095
I'mma go sit in the back.

01:22:15.799 --> 01:22:17.365
Not very green.

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:20.768
Well, if you dump it on the
land, it stains the ground red.

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:23.372
Like having a big meth lab
sign in your front yard.

01:22:26.008 --> 01:22:28.843
The creek
washes it clear away.

01:22:28.845 --> 01:22:30.946
By tomorrow,
you'd never know it was here.

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:42.656
So that's it, huh? All done?

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:43.760
Yeah.

01:22:50.866 --> 01:22:52.634
I thought you'd be relieved.

01:22:54.236 --> 01:22:55.838
I am.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.909
So, once you got me
out of your hair, then what?

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.982
I've been thinking
about what your mama said.

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.485
And about how
cuttin' up matchbooks

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.285
is part of making meth.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.288
You doing a lot of thinking.

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:19.426
I guess so.

01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:21.730
I got this idea they're kinda
connected, you know?

01:23:24.298 --> 01:23:26.234
I don't got it figured out
in my head yet, but..

01:23:27.401 --> 01:23:28.837
...it's like..

01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:31.872
Like, in our life,
everyone we meet

01:23:31.874 --> 01:23:33.474
is a chemical reaction.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:38.477
They change us
and we change them.

01:23:38.479 --> 01:23:41.514
'Cause we changed,
we can go on and have different

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.249
reactions with other people.

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.353
And we don't always know
how it will end up.

01:23:47.054 --> 01:23:48.420
We don't.

01:23:48.422 --> 01:23:49.956
Like the matchbooks,
they don't know

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.559
how they're gonna end up.

01:23:53.594 --> 01:23:55.530
But just 'cause
we can't see a plan..

01:23:58.299 --> 01:24:00.167
...that don't mean
there ain't one.

01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:07.475
Anyway, it made me feel
a little better about things..

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:10.978
...thinking it all
fit together somehow.

01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:37.571
Cousin.

01:24:42.776 --> 01:24:44.609
It's nice to see you too.

01:24:44.611 --> 01:24:46.379
Hi, L-O-L.

01:24:49.482 --> 01:24:51.115
Hey.. See, hey, hey!

01:24:51.117 --> 01:24:53.219
Ain't you gonna say
nothin' about my duds, huh?

01:24:56.022 --> 01:24:57.490
Nice duds.

01:25:10.971 --> 01:25:12.939
We'll be back tomorrow
with your cut.

01:25:18.078 --> 01:25:20.013
You're welcome.

01:25:43.902 --> 01:25:45.170
So that's it?

01:25:46.405 --> 01:25:47.840
All clear?

01:25:49.341 --> 01:25:51.908
Well, we should probably
lay low for a little bit.

01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:53.777
I'll go pick up
the truck around noon

01:25:53.779 --> 01:25:56.214
and drop you off
with the state police.

01:25:59.084 --> 01:26:00.519
What'll I tell them?

01:26:01.453 --> 01:26:03.221
Tell 'em the truth.

01:26:04.857 --> 01:26:08.290
I'll be cleared out
of here by dark.

01:26:08.292 --> 01:26:10.927
You're leavin'?

01:26:10.929 --> 01:26:12.363
It's time.

01:26:15.934 --> 01:26:17.468
You can only sit still so long.

01:26:21.106 --> 01:26:26.145
Besides, there's too many
ghosts in these woods.

01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:34.153
I guess I can give
this back now.

01:26:42.193 --> 01:26:43.294
Keep it.

01:26:45.596 --> 01:26:48.831
A conversation piece,
for all the friends

01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:50.666
you're gonna make in DC.

01:26:50.668 --> 01:26:52.735
Yeah, I'm not so
sure that they're gonna..

01:26:54.772 --> 01:26:57.640
You old dog.

01:26:57.642 --> 01:26:59.375
<i>This explains everything!</i>

01:26:59.377 --> 01:27:01.577
Well, you could've
just told me.

01:27:01.579 --> 01:27:04.814
- He didn't want to share.
- And he shouldn't have to.

01:27:04.816 --> 01:27:06.816
So what if we seen her first?

01:27:06.818 --> 01:27:09.185
That don't mean nothin' to me

01:27:09.187 --> 01:27:11.020
when it comes
to Cousin Lowell's happiness.

01:27:11.022 --> 01:27:15.191
N... now, now, now you just,
you just hold on there, Lowell.

01:27:15.193 --> 01:27:18.493
You proven to be
pretty untrustworthy lately

01:27:18.495 --> 01:27:19.995
<i>and I don't think
we can leave it up to you</i>

01:27:19.997 --> 01:27:21.766
to do the right thing here.

01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.267
So this little lady..

01:27:26.269 --> 01:27:28.705
...is just gonna
have to come with us now.

01:27:32.509 --> 01:27:33.942
Take a seat, Holli.

01:27:33.944 --> 01:27:37.245
We ain't got time to be havin'
this conversation, Lowell.

01:27:37.247 --> 01:27:39.015
Make time.

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.863
Won't take long.

01:28:05.508 --> 01:28:07.842
<i>Sawyer, honey..</i>

01:28:07.844 --> 01:28:10.113
...you mind heating me up
a cup of that coffee?

01:28:11.313 --> 01:28:12.749
It's okay.

01:28:16.385 --> 01:28:18.221
Just fetch the coffee.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.369
I swear I should've known.

01:28:36.806 --> 01:28:39.475
We been all through
these goddamn woods.

01:28:47.283 --> 01:28:48.884
Here's the thing..

01:28:51.086 --> 01:28:53.022
<i>...I know what
has to get done.</i>

01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:58.060
And I'll take care of it..

01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:01.831
...in my time.

01:29:06.969 --> 01:29:08.936
But for now..

01:29:08.938 --> 01:29:11.772
...would you just
let me have some fun?

01:29:11.774 --> 01:29:14.709
<i>I mean, you see how trained
I got her, don't you?</i>

01:29:46.808 --> 01:29:49.408
That's it, baby.

01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:52.013
Now, get over here
and sit on my knee.

01:30:01.322 --> 01:30:02.454
<i>Goddamn!</i>

01:30:02.456 --> 01:30:04.422
<i>You sure do got some things</i>

01:30:04.424 --> 01:30:06.558
<i>to teach me, boy.</i>

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.227
And the thing is,
if it was up to me...

01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:10.762
- <i>Holli?</i>
- H... hang on, Buck.

01:30:10.764 --> 01:30:11.898
I think there's
something wrong...

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.166
Hang on a second,
the thing is though

01:30:14.168 --> 01:30:15.700
it ain't just up to me..

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:18.472
But, Holli, the microwave..

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:03.381
<i>Come on!</i>

01:31:06.853 --> 01:31:07.953
Please!

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:10.288
I can't.

01:31:16.330 --> 01:31:18.332
You remember Bishop's Road?

01:31:21.467 --> 01:31:22.402
I can't..

01:31:23.636 --> 01:31:25.602
You're gonna be okay.

01:31:31.744 --> 01:31:32.678
Run!

01:32:21.559 --> 01:32:22.495
Easy now.

01:32:25.697 --> 01:32:27.398
Don't do nothin' stupid.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.534
Yous about all the stupid
this family needs.

01:32:30.568 --> 01:32:33.036
Why'd you go and do all this?

01:32:33.038 --> 01:32:34.337
For some girl?

01:32:36.475 --> 01:32:37.542
What does it matter?

01:32:40.745 --> 01:32:41.713
It's done.

01:32:47.052 --> 01:32:47.986
Sheriff.

01:33:17.282 --> 01:33:20.516
<i>Jesus! That fucking Lowell.</i>

01:33:21.519 --> 01:33:23.455
She was here
the whole goddamn time.

01:33:27.591 --> 01:33:30.560
- Is the meth..
- The cruiser, down the way.

01:33:30.562 --> 01:33:31.993
Thank God.

01:33:31.995 --> 01:33:33.563
<i>That girl run off, O'Doyle.</i>

01:33:33.565 --> 01:33:34.796
Through them woods

01:33:34.798 --> 01:33:37.099
headed toward Bishop's Road.

01:33:37.101 --> 01:33:39.234
I'mma go after her.

01:33:39.236 --> 01:33:41.536
- You circle around the road.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:33:41.538 --> 01:33:42.671
And I'll flush her out to you.

01:33:42.673 --> 01:33:43.974
Yeah, yeah, that's, uh..

01:33:44.975 --> 01:33:46.276
...good thinkin' there.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.513
Don't forget your gun there.

01:33:51.515 --> 01:33:52.449
Right.

01:33:54.918 --> 01:33:56.251
Fuck!

01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:04.426
Go on, pick it up.

01:34:08.865 --> 01:34:09.799
Come on, boy.

01:34:12.369 --> 01:34:13.303
O'Doyle..

01:34:13.936 --> 01:34:15.102
Ah..

01:34:15.104 --> 01:34:16.072
You can't.

01:34:16.973 --> 01:34:18.342
We're partners.

01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:20.477
Go ahead.

01:34:21.311 --> 01:34:22.245
I won't.

01:34:24.247 --> 01:34:27.281
I won't, I won't do it.

01:34:27.283 --> 01:34:29.250
You can't shoot me
if I ain't armed.

01:34:31.287 --> 01:34:33.954
You think I'm concerned
with the forensics

01:34:33.956 --> 01:34:38.227
on a known felon shot outside
a burning meth house?

01:34:41.697 --> 01:34:46.402
Son, I just wanted you to feel
like you had a fighting chance.

01:35:02.118 --> 01:35:03.352
You didn't.

01:36:29.671 --> 01:36:32.237
So you're saying..

01:36:32.239 --> 01:36:35.340
...this Lowell Pritchert guy..

01:36:35.342 --> 01:36:36.743
...was holding you?

01:36:36.745 --> 01:36:39.278
No, not holding me.
Hiding me.

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.513
Oh, okay, from, uh,
from these other fellas

01:36:41.515 --> 01:36:42.813
that was after you.

01:36:42.815 --> 01:36:43.814
Why aren't you calling this in?

01:36:43.816 --> 01:36:45.150
He could still be alive.

01:36:45.152 --> 01:36:46.652
Hold on now there, miss.

01:36:46.654 --> 01:36:48.220
No sense in callin' anything in

01:36:48.222 --> 01:36:49.523
until I get all the facts.

01:36:56.297 --> 01:36:58.232
<i>So these other fellas, uh..</i>

01:36:59.733 --> 01:37:01.233
...was it just the two of them?

01:37:01.235 --> 01:37:02.401
Hmm.

01:37:02.403 --> 01:37:04.569
Buck and Hollister.

01:37:04.571 --> 01:37:08.039
They all work for somebody else
but I never saw him.

01:37:08.041 --> 01:37:09.708
Shouldn't you at least
call an ambulance

01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:11.510
or back-up or somethin'?

01:37:11.512 --> 01:37:12.810
Well, now, here's the deal

01:37:12.812 --> 01:37:15.781
you're just gonna have to trust
my way of doin' things

01:37:15.783 --> 01:37:17.683
'cause around here..

01:37:17.685 --> 01:37:20.251
Well, I'm the chief..

01:37:20.253 --> 01:37:21.655
...you're the Indian.

01:37:23.923 --> 01:37:26.392
So, this third guy,
you never saw him?

01:37:27.728 --> 01:37:29.028
Did you get a name?

01:37:30.798 --> 01:37:31.732
No.

01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:38.404
A voice?

01:37:40.239 --> 01:37:43.607
- Um, what?
- A voice?

01:37:43.609 --> 01:37:45.978
Did you hear him?
What his voice sound like?

01:37:48.348 --> 01:37:49.449
Oh..

01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:52.216
I don't know, just..

01:37:52.218 --> 01:37:55.586
...just normal,
just a normal voice.

01:37:55.588 --> 01:37:59.590
Hmm. So you wouldn't recognize
him if you heard him again.

01:37:59.592 --> 01:38:00.526
No.

01:38:01.728 --> 01:38:03.028
I definitely wouldn't know.

01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:21.046
I think we're gonna walk
the rest of the way.

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:45.771
Come on now.

01:39:04.823 --> 01:39:07.091
Just go on down
a little further there..

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:08.959
...down by the water.

01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:20.402
<i>They call this Rust Creek..</i>

01:39:20.404 --> 01:39:22.673
...because of all the clay
deposits up the hill.

01:39:24.241 --> 01:39:25.844
Turned the water red.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:30.815
And they mined up all the clay
before I was born.

01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:34.652
That name stuck though.

01:39:48.799 --> 01:39:50.099
Let's go on now.

01:40:13.089 --> 01:40:14.023
Okay.

01:40:16.426 --> 01:40:17.360
Okay.

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:22.031
You don't have to do this.

01:40:24.334 --> 01:40:25.268
Hm.

01:40:28.204 --> 01:40:29.506
In the water.
