I forgot to have them
put your names on them.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.471
Oh, that's okay.

16:49.608 --> 16:51.042
That's decaf.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.144
Um, no...
[ chuckles ]

16:53.146 --> 16:56.114
That one's decaf.
No. Wait. Um...

17:00.986 --> 17:02.787
To be perfectly honest,

17:02.789 --> 17:05.790
I'm not really sure
I even got decaf.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.725
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.093
Coffee time...

17:11.631 --> 17:16.234
Look, I thought zoey had
the johnson family hustle,

17:16.236 --> 17:18.770
I teed her up to take it
to the next level,

17:18.772 --> 17:20.738
And she quit
on her own project.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.040
Dre, did she quit,

17:22.042 --> 17:24.642
Or did you take over
and force her out?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.077
No, she quit.
Oh, dre,

17:26.079 --> 17:28.079
You were so excited
that she had the hustle,

17:28.081 --> 17:29.814
And then you didn't even
let her do it herself.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.649
You say
it's about the kids,

17:31.651 --> 17:34.152
And then it becomes all
about you and your ego.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.388
Sweetie, do you think this
is gonna say to janine

17:37.390 --> 17:39.757
That I am ballin'
out of control?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.092
[ chuckles ]
baby...

17:41.094 --> 17:42.727
You are definitely
out of control.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.764
I'm gonna go down by her mailbox
and wait for her to come out.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.332

17:58.110 --> 18:00.478
Ah. Hey, zoey.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.779
Sorry, dad.
I'm working.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.182
Unless you want
to take this over, too.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.850
Uh...

18:05.852 --> 18:08.186
Hey, look,
come on, baby girl.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.488
I get it. I messed up.
All right?

18:10.490 --> 18:13.791
But I need you to understand
where I'm coming from.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.594
I grew up in compton
with bars on my house,

18:16.596 --> 18:19.297
And we had nothing to steal,
but we still had bars,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.566
Which I'm pretty sure
the neighbors stole

18:21.568 --> 18:24.402
And put on their house,
and<i> they</i> had nothing to steal.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.837
You know that thing when
you don't get to the point?

18:25.839 --> 18:29.740
Everything I got,
I had to work for.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.809
So when I saw that sparkle
of hustle in you,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.778
Baby girl,
I got excited.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.314
But then you just took
everything out of my thing

18:36.316 --> 18:37.748
That made it me.
I know.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.517
But that's why
I put it back in.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.751
What are you talking about?

18:40.753 --> 18:41.853
Look, I read your pitches,

18:41.855 --> 18:43.554
And they're actually
pretty good.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.256
"actually"?

18:45.258 --> 18:46.624
You see I'm trying here,
right?

18:46.626 --> 18:50.328
The sandwich lady is on the
floor, and I am missing out.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.163
You know, I've seen
actual fights start

18:52.165 --> 18:53.598
Over her
tarragon chicken salad.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.534
I sent your stuff over
to hard candy,

18:56.536 --> 19:00.338
And they sent over
this box of makeup.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.173
And they said that if you
can double your followers

19:02.175 --> 19:03.608
Within six months,

19:03.610 --> 19:06.177
They might even be able to send
some real money your way.

19:06.179 --> 19:09.147
Wait.
Double my followers?
Mm-hmm.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.915
I don't know if I can do that
<i>and</i> my homework.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.583
Hey,
you'll figure it out.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.818
[ chuckles ]
thanks, dad.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.354

the coffee order right!

Aah!

on the glass, zoe!

19:21.427 --> 19:22.260

19:31.938 --> 19:33.838
Oh! I can't find
janine anywhere.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.373
Are the greensteins
on vacation?

19:35.375 --> 19:37.308
I need her to see me
like this.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.643
No, you don't.
I --

19:38.645 --> 19:40.311
I'm gonna go douse myself
with some expensive perfume.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.279
That'll help.
I --

19:41.281 --> 19:42.513

19:42.515 --> 19:44.482
You need me
to shred this?

19:44.484 --> 19:46.350
I wouldn't.
It's your paycheck.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.518
I got paid?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.753
Yeah.
You've earned it.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.188

I know I was hard on you
this week,

19:51.758 --> 19:53.758
And you made some mistakes,
but you didn't quit.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.693
I respect that.
