_

01:11.409 --> 01:13.209
Ono, is he all right?

01:16.130 --> 01:19.332
He's fine. But his hoof
is stuck under a heavy rock.

01:19.384 --> 01:22.084
Beshte, see if you can
move that rock.

01:22.086 --> 01:25.087
- Bunga, be ready to pull him free.
- Right.

01:27.091 --> 01:29.008
I gotcha, gazellie.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.177
<i>Twende Kiboko!</i>

01:32.730 --> 01:34.230
Okay, Little B, pull away.

01:35.350 --> 01:39.185
- Uh-oh. Whoa!
- Bunga!

01:41.022 --> 01:43.239
<i>Hapana! They're sliding
towards that cliff!</i>

01:43.274 --> 01:45.157
Whoa!

01:45.193 --> 01:46.158
I'm coming, Bunga!

01:50.081 --> 01:53.949
 Yes!
No!

01:54.001 --> 01:56.035
Grab him, Bunga!
Don't let him fall.

01:56.087 --> 01:57.086
<i>Zuka zama!</i>

01:58.122 --> 01:59.455
Slow down!

02:11.051 --> 02:15.054
Aw, you're okay. You got to
admit, it was kind of fun.

02:17.191 --> 02:19.108
I better see this little one home.

02:19.143 --> 02:21.394
It looks like it's about to...

02:21.446 --> 02:24.980
- Rain.
- Good call, Ono.

02:32.323 --> 02:34.290
Ah, it feels good
to be out of the rain.

02:35.243 --> 02:36.992
You said it, Fuli.

02:40.248 --> 02:42.248
Yeah. Very funny.

02:43.468 --> 02:46.335
Whee!
Whoa! Whoa!

02:46.337 --> 02:48.254
Yeah, at last.

02:49.724 --> 02:51.140
Finished! Ha-ha!

02:54.429 --> 02:58.180
- Ah, I love that trick.
- Eh? No, no, no...

02:58.182 --> 03:00.983
The neck.
It is much too short.

03:02.186 --> 03:05.187
And he's upside down,
just like you, Rafiki.

03:05.189 --> 03:08.908
Mmm, yes.
I can fix that.

03:08.943 --> 03:11.026
- Ha-ha!
- Whoa!

03:12.113 --> 03:14.363
And now, I'll fix this.

03:17.034 --> 03:20.035
One longer giraffe neck,
coming up.

03:20.087 --> 03:23.339
And up, and up.

03:27.345 --> 03:28.377
Whoa!

03:31.132 --> 03:32.097
Hmm.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.221
Everyone, everyone.

03:39.223 --> 03:41.223
Ono. How's
the baby gazelle?

03:41.275 --> 03:44.977
He's fine. But now
we've got a zebra stampede.

03:45.029 --> 03:47.062
One of those days, huh?

03:47.114 --> 03:49.114
Yep. Come on, Lion Guard.

03:49.150 --> 03:52.034
Let's go calm the zebras down
before they hurt somebody.

03:59.961 --> 04:02.044
 Oh, no.

04:06.133 --> 04:09.919
Kion, the zebras are headed
for a family of hyraxes.

04:09.921 --> 04:11.921
Then we'll need to stop them
before they get there.

04:11.973 --> 04:13.005
Come on!

04:14.342 --> 04:16.175
Huh, look at that.

04:16.226 --> 04:19.011
Those rocks look just like
the ones in Rafiki's painting.

04:20.314 --> 04:23.265
The zebras look like the ones
from Rafiki's painting, too.

04:23.267 --> 04:24.400
Whoa!

04:24.435 --> 04:27.152
Zebras. Rocks.

04:28.305 --> 04:29.438
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

04:29.473 --> 04:31.306
What's the krabubble, Little B?

04:31.308 --> 04:34.143
Those rocks are gonna
fall on the zebras!

04:34.195 --> 04:35.561
- How do you know?
- I'll explain later.

04:35.613 --> 04:38.147
We gotta move
the zebras away from 'em.

04:38.532 --> 04:39.531
Move it, fellas!

04:43.320 --> 04:45.237
Say. What's the big idea?

04:45.289 --> 04:47.239
You got to get away
from those rocks.

04:51.212 --> 04:53.162
Kion, the rocks!

04:53.164 --> 04:54.496
<i>Heyvi kabisa.</i>

04:54.498 --> 04:58.417
Fuli, forget about stopping them.
Turn them.

04:58.469 --> 05:00.169
Got it.

05:06.310 --> 05:09.311
Okay, Lion Guard.
Slow 'em down.

05:09.346 --> 05:12.181
Easy, zebras.
You're safe now.

05:12.233 --> 05:14.483
Slow down.
No need to panic.

05:14.518 --> 05:17.569
Whoa, zebra. Whoa!

05:17.605 --> 05:20.439
There we go.
Easy does it.

05:22.193 --> 05:24.193
Nice job, everyone.
The hyraxes are safe.

05:25.279 --> 05:29.215
- Un-Bunga-lievable.
- So, Little B.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.333
How did you know
those rocks were gonna fall?

05:31.368 --> 05:34.369
I'll show you. I gotta show
Beshte somethin' back at the lair.

05:34.421 --> 05:38.173
- See you there.
- Uh, okay.

05:38.209 --> 05:40.509
So, what caused
the herd to stampede?

05:40.544 --> 05:43.212
Well, we were
at our grazing grounds

05:43.264 --> 05:46.431
when all of a sudden
there was a big boom.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.600
A boom?
What do you mean, a "boom"?

05:48.636 --> 05:53.305
You know, a great big boom.

05:53.357 --> 05:55.958
I think he might mean
thunder. And that storm

05:55.959 --> 05:58.560
this morning was near
the zebra grazing grounds.

05:58.612 --> 06:02.231
- What's thunder?
- Um, it goes boom?

06:02.233 --> 06:06.285
Yes. That's it exactly.
A great big boom.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.487
It was loud and scary.

06:08.539 --> 06:11.373
So we did what we always do
when something scares us.

06:11.408 --> 06:14.126
We panicked and ran.

06:14.161 --> 06:16.078
Good plan.

06:16.130 --> 06:18.213
Well, the storm clouds are gone.

06:18.249 --> 06:19.581
You have nothing to worry about.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.250
So you can all go home.

06:21.252 --> 06:25.420
Fabulous.
Uh, now, which way's home?

06:26.507 --> 06:29.391
Ono, make sure
the zebras get home safe.

06:29.426 --> 06:33.345
Affirmative.
This way, zebras. Follow me.

06:35.432 --> 06:37.432
How are we supposed
to follow him?

06:37.484 --> 06:41.010
- We can't fly.
- Seriously?

06:42.189 --> 06:45.440
Oh! 
Hey. Wait for me.

06:52.449 --> 06:54.283
Mmm-mmm.

06:54.285 --> 06:56.535
Look at all those tasty zebras.

06:56.587 --> 06:59.204
Yeah. Look at 'em.

06:59.256 --> 07:02.341
I'm lookin',
I'm lookin'. Ooh.

07:02.376 --> 07:05.294
All those stripes make me dizzy.

07:05.346 --> 07:09.264
- What are we gonna do, Janja?
- We follow 'em.

07:09.299 --> 07:11.350
Once Ono leaves, we can spook 'em,

07:11.385 --> 07:15.520
and then those stripey treats
will be ours for the takin'.

09:05.416 --> 09:08.250
Okay, Big B, look at this.

09:10.170 --> 09:11.303
The zebras are running.

09:14.091 --> 09:17.426
And now,
the rocks are falling.

09:17.428 --> 09:20.345
That's just like
what happened today.

09:20.397 --> 09:23.098
- I know.
- But what's it mean?

09:23.150 --> 09:25.693
Don't you get it?
These paintings show what's

09:25.694 --> 09:28.236
going to happen before
it actually happens.

09:28.272 --> 09:31.406
<i>They predict the future?
Poa.</i>

09:31.442 --> 09:35.193
- Hey, doesn't this one look like...
- Kion!

09:39.116 --> 09:40.449
- Oh, no!
- I don't wanna watch!

09:44.121 --> 09:47.539
Bunga. If these paintings
tell the future, that means...

09:47.591 --> 09:50.375
Kion's going to fall off
a really high tree.

09:50.427 --> 09:51.593
He could get hurt.

09:51.628 --> 09:54.583
Or worse.
We got to warn him!

09:57.634 --> 09:59.551
- Hi, Rafiki.
- Bye, Rafiki.

09:59.603 --> 10:01.269
Hmm?

10:01.305 --> 10:02.270
Mmm.

10:11.565 --> 10:13.532
Here we are.
Zebra grazing ground.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.151
You're all back home.

10:16.203 --> 10:19.538
Really? Hmm. I guess
it does look familiar.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.492
Thank you for getting us
here safely, Ono.

10:23.494 --> 10:26.106
My pleasure. Keeping everyone
in the Pride Lands safe

10:26.107 --> 10:27.412
is the Lion Guard's duty.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.167
So, Janja. We've followed
the zebras home.

10:32.169 --> 10:34.636
Can we chase 'em now, Janja?
Can we?

10:34.671 --> 10:37.272
Not yet.
Stick with the plan.

10:37.307 --> 10:41.376
We wait till Ono leaves,
then we chase the zebras.

10:41.411 --> 10:44.313
Yeah, you heard him.
Stick with the plan.

10:44.314 --> 10:46.248
Stick with the plan. Right.

10:48.452 --> 10:51.169
Uh... What was the plan again?

10:51.205 --> 10:53.421
Oh, just wait till I say "go."

10:53.457 --> 10:56.191
<i>Right!</i>

10:56.226 --> 10:57.592
Uh... What's he gonna say?

10:57.628 --> 10:59.528
- Go!
- I'm going. I'm going.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.114
Wait for me.

11:02.166 --> 11:06.501
Oh, those fur brains.
I said wait till I say "go."

11:06.537 --> 11:08.370
Oh, and I just said it.

11:08.422 --> 11:10.505
Hey, hey! Wait for me!

11:14.461 --> 11:16.344
<i>Hyenas?
Hapana!</i>

11:16.380 --> 11:18.213
I've got to get
the rest of the Guard.

11:18.215 --> 11:21.383
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

11:22.553 --> 11:25.604
Janja was right.
Look at 'em go.

11:25.639 --> 11:28.473
<i>Panic and run.
Panic and run.</i>

11:30.227 --> 11:31.610
Think the zebras
made it home safe?

11:31.645 --> 11:34.396
Ono's keeping an eye on them.
We should know soon enough.

11:34.448 --> 11:35.480
Kion!

11:35.532 --> 11:37.532
Hey.
What were you showing Beshte?

11:37.568 --> 11:39.568
You're not going to believe this.

11:39.620 --> 11:44.489
Rafiki's paintings,
they predict the future.

11:44.541 --> 11:46.074
You're right!

11:46.543 --> 11:48.326
I don't believe it.

11:48.378 --> 11:51.296
There's no way Rafiki's
paintings can predict the...

11:51.331 --> 11:52.464
Kion. Kion.

11:52.499 --> 11:54.633
We have a big problem this time.

11:54.668 --> 11:57.586
Oh, let me guess, zebras again.

11:57.638 --> 12:00.422
Yes, but they're being
chased by hyenas.

12:00.424 --> 12:03.175
- Hyenas?
- Then there's no time to waste.

12:03.227 --> 12:05.177
Ono, lead us to the zebras.

12:05.229 --> 12:07.395
- And fast.
- Affirmative.

12:07.431 --> 12:11.433
- But Kion, the paintings.
- No time for paintings, Bunga.

12:11.435 --> 12:14.236
We need to stop the hyenas.

12:14.271 --> 12:16.271
But what if Rafiki's painting
comes true

12:16.323 --> 12:18.273
while we're fighting the hyenas?

12:18.275 --> 12:22.360
We just need to make sure
Kion doesn't climb any trees.

12:24.448 --> 12:26.581
Wow! These zebras are fast.

12:26.617 --> 12:29.117
Great. I love fast food.

12:30.537 --> 12:33.288
I wouldn't mind
if they slowed down a little.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.373
I'm getting dizzy.

12:37.594 --> 12:39.377
There they are.

12:39.429 --> 12:42.380
Ono, lead the zebras
away from the hyenas.

12:42.432 --> 12:43.598
Try to calm them down.

12:43.634 --> 12:45.217
You got it, Kion.

12:45.269 --> 12:47.469
You three take care
of Cheezi and Chungu.

12:47.471 --> 12:49.221
Leave Janja to me.

12:49.273 --> 12:51.306
Till the Pride Lands end...

12:51.308 --> 12:53.308
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

12:54.444 --> 12:56.561
I'm gonna get ya.
I'm gonna get ya.

13:12.496 --> 13:14.329
Kion, no!

13:14.331 --> 13:15.380
Not the tree!

13:18.252 --> 13:20.335
These zebras never even
saw us coming.

13:20.337 --> 13:23.171
That's 'cause
zebras ain't too smart.

13:24.591 --> 13:27.309
They are not the only ones.

13:27.344 --> 13:29.511
Hey, the Lion Guard?

13:29.513 --> 13:31.596
We never even saw you coming.

13:35.402 --> 13:36.518
Kion, look out!

13:36.570 --> 13:38.520
Bunga. What are you...
Whoa!

13:41.358 --> 13:43.575
Where did you even come from?

13:43.610 --> 13:46.328
Doesn't matter.
I know where you're going.

13:46.363 --> 13:50.198
<i>Panic and run, panic and run!</i>

13:50.200 --> 13:51.533
Good idea, fur brains.

13:51.535 --> 13:55.370
- And don't come back!
- Bunga, why'd you do that?

13:55.372 --> 13:57.289
I don't want them to come back.

13:57.341 --> 13:59.541
No, why'd you knock me
out of that tree?

13:59.543 --> 14:02.294
I was trying to
take Janja by surprise.

14:02.346 --> 14:04.179
Oh, yeah, about that...

14:04.214 --> 14:06.548
Well, that's a
new way to run off hyenas.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.183
Fall on them.

14:08.218 --> 14:10.352
That wasn't exactly the plan.

14:11.471 --> 14:13.521
Hey, did you see that?
Kion fell from the tree

14:13.557 --> 14:17.142
just like the painting predicted.
Good thing I saved him.

14:17.194 --> 14:20.228
Looked to me like you pushed
him and Janja saved him.

14:20.280 --> 14:23.231
Besides, what if that
wasn't the right tree?

14:23.283 --> 14:25.200
Then he's still in danger!

14:25.235 --> 14:27.369
At least the zebras are safe
and we can head home.

14:27.404 --> 14:29.537
There aren't any trees
in the lair.

14:29.573 --> 14:31.373
Everyone, we have a problem.

14:31.408 --> 14:34.326
I did a quick count of the herd,
and we're three zebras short.

14:34.378 --> 14:36.578
- What?
- The hyenas didn't get them, did they?

14:36.580 --> 14:39.297
No, no, no. I've spotted
the missing zebras.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.384
But they're stranded on the
other side of Maji Baridi Falls.

14:42.419 --> 14:44.219
How'd they get way over there?

14:44.254 --> 14:46.421
I'm guessing
they panicked and ran.

14:46.473 --> 14:50.425
Well, however they got there,
we've got to help them get back.

14:50.427 --> 14:52.227
Ono, lead the way.

14:52.262 --> 14:53.311
Affirmative.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.565
So, how are we gonna
protect Kion now?

14:57.601 --> 14:59.351
Don't worry, Little B.

14:59.403 --> 15:02.487
Maybe there aren't any trees
between here and Maji Baridi Falls.

15:04.574 --> 15:09.361
Everywhere you look,
trees, trees, trees.

15:09.413 --> 15:13.581
- And just now you're noticing?
- A tree branch!

15:13.617 --> 15:17.285
Bunga, it's on the ground.
How could Kion fall from it?

15:17.287 --> 15:19.371
He could trip. Look out!

15:19.423 --> 15:21.423
Ahhh! Bunga?

15:21.458 --> 15:24.459
Bunga? Leave Ushari alone.

15:24.461 --> 15:28.129
Sorry. Thought you were
a tree branch. My bad!

15:28.131 --> 15:32.300
I should bite you, Bunga,
but the last time I did,

15:32.302 --> 15:36.488
I couldn't get the taste
out of my mouth for days.

15:38.308 --> 15:41.276
Your loss, Ushari.
I taste great!

15:41.311 --> 15:44.279
Oh, come on,
let's find those zebras.

15:44.314 --> 15:47.482
Come on, Bunga.
More trees ahead.

15:47.484 --> 15:50.151
All right, you two.
What's going on?

15:50.153 --> 15:52.370
You're acting even stranger
than usual.

15:53.623 --> 15:55.290
Okay.

15:55.325 --> 15:57.325
So I was looking
at Rafiki's paintings.

15:57.377 --> 15:59.461
You know how his staff
can make them move...

16:02.215 --> 16:04.416
And the zebra stampede
and rock fall

16:04.468 --> 16:06.501
were just like the painting.

16:06.553 --> 16:08.503
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

16:08.555 --> 16:11.556
And then we saw Kion
fall off the tree branch.

16:11.591 --> 16:15.226
Mmm. Still sounds
hard to believe.

16:15.262 --> 16:16.344
But what if it's true?

16:16.346 --> 16:18.513
How would you feel
if Kion got hurt?

16:18.515 --> 16:22.183
Okay, let's go warn him.

16:22.235 --> 16:24.402
We tried.
He didn't believe us.

16:24.438 --> 16:26.237
Uh-oh. Look.

16:29.493 --> 16:32.193
Kion. You can see
the zebras from up here.

16:32.195 --> 16:34.112
Great. I'll take a look.

16:34.164 --> 16:35.530
Calm down. I got this.

16:35.532 --> 16:37.332
Fuli.
Wait for us.

16:38.535 --> 16:40.585
Kion, no!

16:40.620 --> 16:43.171
Hey!

16:43.206 --> 16:45.340
Hang on, Kion.
We're coming.

16:45.375 --> 16:47.542
Whoa!

16:47.544 --> 16:50.428
Whoa!

16:52.349 --> 16:55.133
What are you guys doing?

16:55.185 --> 16:56.518
- What's going on?
- Kion.

16:56.553 --> 16:58.470
I just spotted a shortcut
to the zebras.

16:58.522 --> 17:00.221
Great. Show us the way.

17:00.223 --> 17:03.224
It's this way,
through the trees.

17:03.226 --> 17:07.444
Hey, I know an even shorter shortcut.

17:07.481 --> 17:09.146
Uh, this way.

17:09.199 --> 17:10.565
- Bunga's right.
- Yeah.

17:17.324 --> 17:20.407
Guys? This is not a shortcut.
What's going on?

17:20.460 --> 17:22.292
We're trying to save Kion.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.212
Save him?
Save him from what?

17:24.247 --> 17:27.332
Remember how Bunga knew to steer
the zebras away from the rocks?

17:27.384 --> 17:30.335
- Yeah?
- Well there's a reason he knew.

17:41.181 --> 17:44.265
If you're right, I better help.
Kion's in danger.

17:44.317 --> 17:46.401
Not anymore, Ono.
Now that you know,

17:46.436 --> 17:49.270
Kion has the whole Lion Guard
looking out for him.

17:49.272 --> 17:53.191
Yeah. And we'll make sure he
doesn't get anywhere near a tree.

17:53.243 --> 17:56.444
 Lion Guard.
I found the zebras.

17:56.446 --> 17:59.280
We can cross the river
on this big tree branch.

17:59.332 --> 18:01.282
Don't worry, I'll save him.

18:01.334 --> 18:03.284
Me too!
Let's all save him.

18:03.336 --> 18:05.453
Kion. No.

18:05.455 --> 18:08.373
- Ono?
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.

18:08.425 --> 18:11.342
But Fuli, Bunga and Beshte...
Oh, no!

18:11.378 --> 18:12.590
Look out.
Me first.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.060
- Wait for me.
- Whoa!

18:16.383 --> 18:18.349
Fuli. Beshte.
Bunga. Stop!

18:25.475 --> 18:27.442
What's going on with everybody?

18:27.477 --> 18:29.477
We were just trying to save you.

18:29.529 --> 18:33.314
- Save me? From what?
- The tree branch.

18:33.366 --> 18:35.149
The tree branch?

18:35.151 --> 18:38.202
Rafiki's painting showed you
falling from a big tree branch.

18:38.238 --> 18:42.240
Bunga. There's no way Rafiki's
paintings tell the future.

18:42.292 --> 18:45.577
Now let's focus on getting
these zebras back to their herd.

18:45.629 --> 18:49.163
Could you get up? Please?

18:49.165 --> 18:51.165
Oh, sorry.

18:54.170 --> 18:55.169
Oh, no!

18:56.172 --> 18:57.338
Zebras, look out!

18:58.391 --> 19:00.508
Panic and run.
Panic and run.

19:06.099 --> 19:08.316
Lion Guard. Help.

19:08.351 --> 19:10.485
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

19:10.520 --> 19:14.405
<i>Hapana! The zebras are heading
towards Maji Baridi Falls.</i>

19:16.159 --> 19:17.241
<i>Heyvi kabisa.</i>

19:18.278 --> 19:20.194
I have an idea. Come on.

19:24.167 --> 19:27.201
I've got to roar from that
branch over the waterfall.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.087
But, Kion, the painting!

19:29.122 --> 19:32.373
I don't care.
It's the only way to save the zebras.

19:35.295 --> 19:38.379
After I roar, make sure
the zebras are okay.

19:38.381 --> 19:40.131
You got it, Kion!

19:48.224 --> 19:49.390
I hope this works.

20:05.158 --> 20:06.717
Whoa!

20:07.410 --> 20:09.243
Oh, comfy.

20:11.331 --> 20:14.549
Kion, you did it!
The zebras are safe!

20:15.552 --> 20:16.584
Whoa!

20:16.636 --> 20:19.253
Kion! No!

20:22.509 --> 20:23.474
I'm okay!

20:25.512 --> 20:26.594
I wasn't worried.

20:28.515 --> 20:32.266
These paintings?
Tell the future?

20:32.318 --> 20:36.270
Bunga! Why would
you think such a thing?

20:36.272 --> 20:40.274
'Cause, 'cause we saw the zebras
run and the rocks fall and then we...

20:40.326 --> 20:44.362
First, do not take Rafiki's staff.

20:44.414 --> 20:49.450
Second, these paintings?
You did not see what you think you saw.

20:49.502 --> 20:51.419
You watched them backwards.

20:52.455 --> 20:55.339
The rocks fall
and the zebras run!

20:56.509 --> 20:58.593
And all of this happened in the past!

20:58.628 --> 21:00.294
<i>The past?</i>

21:00.346 --> 21:03.264
Yes, yes.
These paintings,

21:03.299 --> 21:06.350
they show the history
of the Pride Lands.

21:06.386 --> 21:09.303
What about this one?
It shows Kion falling!

21:09.355 --> 21:13.307
Leap to conclusions
and you leap to confusions!

21:13.309 --> 21:15.393
We leap to what?
I'm confused.

21:15.445 --> 21:18.563
That is not Kion.
It's Nala's father,

21:18.615 --> 21:21.482
Kion's grandfather,
when he was a cub.

21:21.534 --> 21:25.153
And you did not watch
the whole thing.

21:25.155 --> 21:29.207
Kion's grandfather did fall
from a big branch.

21:29.242 --> 21:33.411
But he was saved
by the Lion Guard of his day.

21:33.463 --> 21:37.215
You see? These paintings
do not predict your future.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.333
Except for this new one.

21:40.637 --> 21:43.504
Is that me? What am I gonna do?
Something fun?

21:46.392 --> 21:49.260
Cleaning the floor?
That doesn't look like fun!

21:52.649 --> 21:56.234
 I think I like
the other paintings better.
