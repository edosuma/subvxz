00:41.874 --> 00:43.806
What are you looking at?

00:47.910 --> 00:49.879
Jetmir's waiting for you.

01:29.152 --> 01:31.200
So Mr. Donne too good to come himself?

01:31.219 --> 01:32.737
I'll tell him he missed out.

01:32.857 --> 01:34.365
Where's the package?

01:36.789 --> 01:37.621
The car.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.371
The suit.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.725
The accent...

01:40.081 --> 01:42.606
You think you are James Bond, right?

01:42.835 --> 01:45.121
Bond gets smarter villains.

01:47.216 --> 01:49.128
Fetch us some drinks.

01:49.248 --> 01:50.920
Nothing for me.

02:03.130 --> 02:04.776
Do you know what this is?

02:04.908 --> 02:07.035
Not yours, I gather.

02:09.544 --> 02:11.445
Proof every man is an animal.

02:11.447 --> 02:12.880
Some are lions.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.581
Some are dogs.

02:14.583 --> 02:17.177
But all drink and shit.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.920
And fuck.

02:18.922 --> 02:21.028
So you're a pimp and a philosopher.

02:23.946 --> 02:25.693
Klara come here.

02:30.131 --> 02:32.251
Let's show him our philosophy.

02:32.634 --> 02:33.742
Nice...

02:33.862 --> 02:35.736
Isn't she?

02:44.380 --> 02:45.745
What's the matter?

02:49.851 --> 02:51.697
Not your type?

02:56.958 --> 02:58.040
That's all of it.

02:58.072 --> 02:59.645
Our business here is done.

03:01.539 --> 03:02.962
You want the case.

03:02.964 --> 03:06.031
I want the money and your car.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.567
That wasn't the deal.

03:07.569 --> 03:09.265
The deal has changed.

03:10.238 --> 03:11.335
Keys!

03:11.739 --> 03:12.638
Now.

03:16.109 --> 03:17.258
Okay then.

03:52.729 --> 03:54.145
Do you mind?

05:16.828 --> 05:18.227
Afternoon.

05:18.949 --> 05:20.120
What are you cooking?

06:53.339 --> 06:54.684
What happened?

06:54.989 --> 06:56.922
Psychotic Albanian...

06:56.924 --> 06:58.799
tried to take my car.

06:59.092 --> 07:00.885
He did what?

07:02.328 --> 07:04.630
And he didn't feel much
like giving this up.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.254
But you got the dress.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.834
Mr. Donne will be relieved.

08:11.863 --> 08:12.873
It's okay.

08:13.230 --> 08:14.391
Come.

08:20.171 --> 08:21.681
You speak English?

08:23.340 --> 08:24.562
Italiano?

08:24.808 --> 08:26.327
FranÃ§ais?

08:26.721 --> 08:28.404
What's your name?

08:28.779 --> 08:29.986
Klara.

08:30.313 --> 08:32.053
Klara Elezi.

08:36.077 --> 08:38.006
What are you doing here?

08:44.294 --> 08:45.753
This is my sister.

08:45.961 --> 08:47.299
Mariana.

08:47.863 --> 08:49.964
We come from small town,

08:49.966 --> 08:51.589
in Russia.

08:53.503 --> 08:55.036
My uncle...

08:55.038 --> 08:57.900
he sold her to a bad man.

08:59.209 --> 09:01.243
I'm sorry, my English is...

09:01.245 --> 09:02.912
It's better than my Russian.

09:02.921 --> 09:04.476
It's okay.

09:06.782 --> 09:08.774
She was taken to border.

09:09.618 --> 09:10.923
I follow.

09:11.653 --> 09:13.788
Then I have no choice...

09:13.790 --> 09:17.391
I give myself to traffickers
or I never find her again.

09:17.393 --> 09:20.125
That's how you ended up with Jetmir?

09:20.129 --> 09:22.412
I try to protect my sister.

09:23.565 --> 09:26.033
Then two weeks ago, she disappeared.

09:26.035 --> 09:28.902
You still haven't
explained why you're here.

09:28.904 --> 09:30.726
When I see him...

09:31.673 --> 09:34.875
I know he can help me find Mariana.

09:38.479 --> 09:39.880
You want money?

09:39.882 --> 09:41.281
I saved.

09:41.283 --> 09:43.202
- I have money.
- No...

09:44.185 --> 09:46.854
I wish I could help, but
I'm not a private detective.

09:46.856 --> 09:48.452
I'm a transporter.

09:49.490 --> 09:50.824
What is...

09:50.826 --> 09:52.425
transporter?

09:52.427 --> 09:55.211
I get paid to deliver things from A to B.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.430
But you must help me!

09:58.733 --> 09:59.999
I wish we could.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.502
Cat?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.405
Sure.

10:05.407 --> 10:07.140
Put your money away.

10:07.908 --> 10:11.738
I'll take you to a shelter.

10:11.858 --> 10:13.512
They'll give you some warm clothes,

10:13.514 --> 10:14.781
a place to sleep.

10:14.783 --> 10:18.432
I don't need a place to sleep.
I need to find my sister!

10:34.001 --> 10:35.867
I don't have a lot of time.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.403
Mariana is young,

10:37.405 --> 10:39.406
worth much money.

10:39.674 --> 10:43.208
Jetmir could have sold her,
or used her in his dirty films!

10:43.210 --> 10:44.910
Did you try the police?

10:44.912 --> 10:45.911
Sure...

10:45.913 --> 10:47.478
They will listen to me.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.815
Come on.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.314
I'm not going.

10:54.269 --> 10:56.754
It's not safe for you to be here.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.239
Well?

11:15.974 --> 11:17.611
Oh, thank God!

11:19.377 --> 11:21.178
Everything went smoothly then?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.602
Except your blackmailer
tried to change the deal.

11:23.611 --> 11:25.415
You don't think he'll
come after me, do you?

11:25.417 --> 11:28.418
Not if this dress is all he has on you, no.

11:29.354 --> 11:31.212
I feel so stupid.

11:31.956 --> 11:33.792
I'm meant to be fighting human trafficking,

11:33.810 --> 11:36.161
and here I am sleeping
with a bloody prostitute.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.395
She approached me.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.077
- I had no idea...
- It was a set-up, Mr. Donne.

11:41.105 --> 11:43.066
You don't have to explain yourself.

11:51.375 --> 11:53.244
What is this? Some kind of joke?

11:54.211 --> 11:55.879
Sort this.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.055
I'm already late for the conference.

12:08.157 --> 12:10.193
Rule Number Three, Frank...

12:11.495 --> 12:13.696
You might wanna rethink that one.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.397
Where's that dress?

12:20.736 --> 12:22.486
Help me find Mariana,

12:22.514 --> 12:24.339
I will tell you where dress is.

12:24.341 --> 12:27.809
People who try to blackmail
me usually regret it.

12:27.811 --> 12:29.844
I need to find my sister.

12:29.846 --> 12:31.468
This isn't the way.

12:31.981 --> 12:33.629
Where's the dress?

12:33.749 --> 12:35.384
You go to Jetmir.

12:35.386 --> 12:36.718
Beat him.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.325
Make him to say where Mariana is.

12:40.423 --> 12:41.956
That plan...

12:44.460 --> 12:46.469
has some flaws.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.263
There is a place

12:49.265 --> 12:51.065
Mariana could be.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.423
Another brothel.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.088
I know the name!

12:58.873 --> 13:00.344
I can take her.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.850
Caterina can take you.

13:08.183 --> 13:10.762
If you need some time to think about it,

13:10.786 --> 13:14.287
I can shut you back in the boot of my car.

13:26.711 --> 13:29.693
_

13:35.943 --> 13:37.706
This is the place?

13:38.309 --> 13:41.218
A lot of the younger girls are taken here.

13:43.484 --> 13:44.995
I'll go inside.

13:45.014 --> 13:47.337
If she's there, I'll bring her to you.

14:47.312 --> 14:49.279
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

14:49.281 --> 14:51.481
I'm looking for a girl.

14:51.483 --> 14:53.283
What kind of girl would you like?

14:53.285 --> 14:55.688
She's not for me, she's for my employer.

14:55.706 --> 14:57.087
Her name is Mariana.

14:57.089 --> 14:59.189
There is no one here called Mariana.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.020
Dark hair, very young.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.994
All of our girls are over 18.

15:03.996 --> 15:05.401
Of course.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.398
My employer is very...

15:08.400 --> 15:09.999
particular.

15:10.001 --> 15:14.145
If something pleases him,
he's willing to pay a lot.

15:18.589 --> 15:21.611
Perhaps he's mistaken her name.

15:21.613 --> 15:24.022
Come with me to see the selection.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.206
Excuse me.

15:33.326 --> 15:34.642
Yeah?

15:35.793 --> 15:37.093
Okay, good.

15:37.095 --> 15:39.041
Yeah, I'll meet you later.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.864
Tia is nice.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.575
Very sweet-natured.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.886
Ah, Cassandra...

15:50.099 --> 15:51.928
Very popular.

15:52.909 --> 15:54.288
Wait...

15:54.911 --> 15:56.703
What about this girl?

15:57.246 --> 15:58.847
Zeta...

15:58.849 --> 16:01.377
She's not available anymore.

16:01.918 --> 16:03.307
She isn't available?

16:03.334 --> 16:05.840
Maybe your boss likes
someone with red hair?

16:05.867 --> 16:08.007
This girl, in the red dress.

16:08.457 --> 16:10.962
Why isn't she available anymore?

16:11.328 --> 16:13.999
I don't think we have
what you're looking for.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.167
Maybe you should leave.

16:17.633 --> 16:19.734
Maybe you want to tell me more.

16:32.648 --> 16:34.281
You're sure you have it this time?

16:34.283 --> 16:35.894
Looks familiar?

16:37.152 --> 16:39.153
They claimed my...

16:39.155 --> 16:41.080
DNA was on it.

16:44.292 --> 16:46.275
Now we'll never know.

17:07.048 --> 17:08.279
Hey.

17:09.249 --> 17:10.675
How did it go?

17:10.885 --> 17:11.955
Not well.

17:11.992 --> 17:13.328
Do you still have that slip?

17:13.346 --> 17:14.928
I just gave it to Donne.

17:15.048 --> 17:16.309
Can you get it back?

17:16.345 --> 17:18.949
Might be a little difficult. It's in ashes.

17:18.977 --> 17:20.714
Well, then we have a problem.

17:21.027 --> 17:22.461
Why's that?

17:22.463 --> 17:24.497
The girl who wore it was murdered.

17:24.499 --> 17:26.665
We just destroyed all the evidence.

17:39.679 --> 17:42.437
You've met before I think, haven't you?

17:43.983 --> 17:47.028
Do you mind if I live you alone
for 5 minutes? I'm really sorry.

17:47.047 --> 17:49.059
- Of course.
- Excuse me. Be back.

17:59.765 --> 18:01.366
What are you doing here?

18:01.368 --> 18:02.468
What's happened?

18:02.477 --> 18:03.675
Did you kill her?

18:03.795 --> 18:05.139
What are you talking about?

18:05.176 --> 18:07.764
Zeta, the girl you slept with. She's dead.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.441
Oh God...

18:13.252 --> 18:14.345
Look...

18:14.347 --> 18:16.714
All I know is she was
alive when I left her.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.347
If she wasn't...

18:19.104 --> 18:21.043
then you used me to destroy evidence,

18:21.058 --> 18:22.778
which makes me an accessory to murder.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.058
I swear to you, I didn't kill her.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.456
I don't know anything about that.

18:26.324 --> 18:27.490
But, uhm...

18:28.207 --> 18:29.715
But "uhm"?

18:32.634 --> 18:34.207
I received this...

18:35.367 --> 18:37.229
a few minutes ago.

18:41.561 --> 18:43.555
It's a video from that night.

18:44.115 --> 18:46.176
Must have been somebody
with a bloody phone.

18:47.839 --> 18:48.980
From Jetmir?

18:50.275 --> 18:52.559
With a demand for more money.

18:52.902 --> 18:54.760
If I don't pay up by tomorrow,

18:54.805 --> 18:56.447
he's gonna post it on the web.

18:56.449 --> 18:57.936
When was this taken?

18:59.319 --> 19:00.617
Four nights ago.

19:01.019 --> 19:01.756
Where?

19:01.778 --> 19:04.719
A party at some castle, Landsman's place.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.289
He seems to be friends with everyone.

19:06.291 --> 19:07.573
Landsman?

19:07.693 --> 19:08.707
Gary Landsman.

19:08.751 --> 19:10.361
The movie producer.

19:12.030 --> 19:13.163
Send me the video.

19:14.665 --> 19:15.765
Why?

19:15.767 --> 19:17.767
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.838
Thank you, Mr. Martin.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.752
I'm not doing this for you.

19:25.009 --> 19:27.677
If I find out you're lying
to me, I'll kill you myself.

19:33.217 --> 19:34.616
Mariana was there.

19:35.752 --> 19:37.161
I know she was.

19:37.856 --> 19:40.222
That woman lied to you.

19:40.224 --> 19:41.791
I don't think so.

19:41.793 --> 19:44.694
That woman told me that girl
in the red dress was murdered.

19:44.696 --> 19:46.833
Why would she admit that if she was lying?

19:53.069 --> 19:55.152
There's something I want to show you.

19:55.182 --> 19:56.638
I've just sent it to you.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.879
It's a video of Donne and the girl.

20:01.886 --> 20:03.326
Taken at a party.

20:03.357 --> 20:04.913
The night she was killed.

20:17.923 --> 20:19.782
What am I watching for?

20:27.436 --> 20:28.577
Oh my God.

20:31.403 --> 20:32.885
It's Mariana.

20:33.005 --> 20:34.742
Are you sure it's her?

20:34.769 --> 20:36.343
I'm sure!

20:36.345 --> 20:39.324
If your sister was there the
night this girl was murdered,

20:40.001 --> 20:42.249
she might know who killed her.

20:49.669 --> 20:51.800
You can stay here tonight.

20:55.028 --> 20:56.440
I can't pay for this.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.305
We don't expect you to.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.738
I'll get you some proper clothes.

21:00.858 --> 21:02.147
Thank you.

21:07.872 --> 21:09.720
My mother's flat...

21:09.840 --> 21:11.540
in Pochep...

21:11.660 --> 21:13.872
is smaller than this room.

21:14.183 --> 21:16.790
You could fit in the whole flat in here.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.384
Twice.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.520
Mariana won't believe me

21:21.522 --> 21:25.048
that I stay in a place like this.

21:28.158 --> 21:32.000
You think I'm stupid to
think Mariana is alive.

21:32.565 --> 21:33.599
No.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.670
No, I don't.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.271
I don't think you're stupid.

21:39.273 --> 21:40.539
But...

21:41.641 --> 21:43.067
if the girl...

21:43.910 --> 21:45.298
was murdered.

21:47.046 --> 21:49.080
And Mariana was with her...

21:49.082 --> 21:51.564
Your sister is valuable to someone.

21:52.003 --> 21:54.352
We just have to figure out who.

21:55.213 --> 21:57.930
But what if she's different?

21:58.405 --> 22:01.091
After everything they've done to her.

22:04.496 --> 22:07.031
If she's got half the guts that you have,

22:07.033 --> 22:08.566
she's gonna be okay.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.783
She'll be okay.

22:17.329 --> 22:18.976
You must be starving.

22:18.978 --> 22:21.411
How about we get you some room service?

22:23.982 --> 22:25.982
What is room service?

22:26.347 --> 22:28.671
What is room service? Oh...

22:31.204 --> 22:32.658
You'll see.

22:44.470 --> 22:45.637
Yeah?

22:45.637 --> 22:46.679
It's Klara.

22:46.716 --> 22:48.884
Where are you, you little whore?

22:48.884 --> 22:50.585
Somewhere you can't find me.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.124
Better pray I don't.

22:52.131 --> 22:53.402
How is your face?

22:53.420 --> 22:56.179
I loved watching the
transporter kick your ass.

22:56.181 --> 22:57.652
You want to die, is that it?

22:57.670 --> 22:58.915
I want my sister.

22:58.917 --> 23:00.134
Dumb bitch!

23:00.418 --> 23:02.451
I told you, I don't know where she is.

23:02.453 --> 23:03.887
Too bad for you then.

23:03.889 --> 23:05.454
Too bad for me?

23:05.456 --> 23:07.978
Bet you'd like to get
even with the transporter.

23:08.259 --> 23:09.559
What do you know about that?

23:09.827 --> 23:11.660
I know where he is.

23:11.662 --> 23:13.396
And I will make you a deal.

23:13.398 --> 23:14.730
You give me my sister.

23:14.732 --> 23:16.599
I give you the transporter.

23:17.634 --> 23:18.936
Don't lie to me.

23:19.270 --> 23:21.542
Bring my sister to the
market square in an hour.

23:21.553 --> 23:23.345
Call this number when you get there.

23:26.409 --> 23:27.442
Well done.

23:27.644 --> 23:29.211
You ought to be an actress.

23:54.469 --> 23:55.716
Are you okay?

23:56.115 --> 23:57.871
I just hope my sister is.

24:05.914 --> 24:06.880
Where is he?

24:09.151 --> 24:10.041
He's there.

24:13.488 --> 24:14.321
Yes?

24:14.323 --> 24:15.203
I'm here.

24:15.900 --> 24:17.123
I see you.

24:17.125 --> 24:18.680
Where's the transporter?

24:18.928 --> 24:20.220
Where is Mariana?

24:20.729 --> 24:23.158
She's in the next car. Can't you see?

24:23.432 --> 24:25.165
He says she's in the second car.

24:25.167 --> 24:26.448
Tell him to let her out.

24:26.769 --> 24:27.812
Let her out.

24:28.469 --> 24:30.007
You can come get her.

24:30.272 --> 24:32.244
Once I find the transporter.

24:32.441 --> 24:33.876
The sidewalk cafe.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.245
She's all yours.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.165
It's not her!

25:34.266 --> 25:35.238
Yeah?

25:35.568 --> 25:36.700
It's not her.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.236
No surprise there.

26:31.655 --> 26:34.250
You tell your boss I'm coming for him.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.447
Who was the girl?

26:55.779 --> 26:57.479
A decoy in a blue wig.

26:57.481 --> 26:58.914
Her name is Blanka.

26:58.916 --> 27:00.949
Another of Jetmir's girls.

27:00.951 --> 27:02.317
What about Jetmir?

27:02.319 --> 27:03.418
I let him go.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.519
You what?

27:04.521 --> 27:06.788
He's the only one who
knows where Mariana is!

27:06.817 --> 27:09.532
And now he'll run back to
whoever's pulling his strings.

27:09.547 --> 27:12.260
He was never gonna tell
us where to find Mariana.

27:12.262 --> 27:13.476
Now he'll show us.

27:13.483 --> 27:14.862
We just have to wait.

27:38.086 --> 27:39.987
Where did you learn to fight?

27:41.422 --> 27:43.490
I grew up in a rough neighbourhood.

27:43.492 --> 27:45.393
I want learn to fight like you.

27:45.427 --> 27:47.734
I want to smash Jetmir in his face.

27:50.665 --> 27:52.854
I'd like to see that, actually.

27:53.337 --> 27:56.436
What, I'm stronger than
I look, I could train up.

27:56.438 --> 27:57.676
I learn quick.

27:58.839 --> 28:01.074
I wouldn't put anything past you.

28:02.076 --> 28:04.177
This movie producer...

28:04.179 --> 28:05.812
Landsman.

28:05.814 --> 28:08.519
The one whose party Donne went to.

28:09.017 --> 28:11.768
He hasn't had a hit in years, but he's...

28:12.236 --> 28:15.221
constantly in the society
pages, throwing big parties...

28:15.223 --> 28:17.387
With girls from Jetmir.

28:17.892 --> 28:19.725
Big business for Jetmir.

28:19.727 --> 28:21.693
Maybe good business for Landsman.

28:21.695 --> 28:23.761
You think Jetmir works for him?

28:23.763 --> 28:25.763
It would certainly pay the bills.

28:32.071 --> 28:33.104
Yeah?

28:33.106 --> 28:36.308
Frank Martin, this is Gary Landsman.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.743
I'd like to see you at my estate.

28:38.745 --> 28:39.543
Now.

28:40.278 --> 28:43.373
Of course, Mr. Landsman.
I'll be there right away.

28:44.249 --> 28:46.784
So he's behind all this.

28:46.786 --> 28:49.117
Now we just have to prove it.

29:12.777 --> 29:14.887
Stay here. I won't be long.

29:32.296 --> 29:34.380
Right this way, Mr. Martin.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.142
What do you think is happening?

29:47.285 --> 29:49.709
What if Landsman attacks Frank?

29:50.847 --> 29:52.855
Landsman won't do that.

29:54.384 --> 29:56.605
And Frank can handle himself.

29:56.806 --> 29:59.836
Will he ask him if he has Mariana?

29:59.956 --> 30:01.222
No.

30:01.224 --> 30:04.125
That would let Landsman know
that she's valuable to us.

30:04.127 --> 30:07.396
But then, how are we going to get her?

30:07.398 --> 30:08.641
She could be here.

30:08.659 --> 30:10.399
She could be in danger now!

30:10.401 --> 30:12.033
If you want to find Mariana,

30:12.035 --> 30:13.946
you're gonna have to be patient.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.890
You know who that is?

30:37.959 --> 30:39.932
Fernando Rivera!

30:41.596 --> 30:42.630
Footballer.

30:43.898 --> 30:45.676
Emilio Rivoli.

30:46.601 --> 30:48.202
You must recognize him.

30:49.304 --> 30:51.471
He's a naughty boy.

30:51.473 --> 30:54.302
He's a very naughty boy.

30:55.076 --> 30:57.110
Anything in a skirt.

30:57.112 --> 30:59.612
I could show you some footage of Emilio.

30:59.614 --> 31:01.042
Make your eyes water.

31:01.049 --> 31:02.496
I'll pass.

31:05.053 --> 31:06.393
So...

31:07.254 --> 31:09.856
you're the troublesome transporter.

31:11.158 --> 31:13.226
You've got a good face.

31:13.228 --> 31:15.595
You ever made any films?

31:15.597 --> 31:18.064
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

31:18.066 --> 31:19.499
Straight-talking. I like that.

31:19.501 --> 31:20.605
Come with me.

31:25.939 --> 31:28.179
What's taking so long?

31:34.814 --> 31:37.275
And why all so many security?

31:41.020 --> 31:44.458
- We should go and look for Mariana.
- Don't be stupid, Klara.

31:46.226 --> 31:47.058
Klara.

31:48.027 --> 31:49.027
Klara!

31:51.898 --> 31:52.905
Absinthe,

31:52.911 --> 31:55.838
banned for nearly a century cause
they thought it drove people mad.

31:56.277 --> 31:58.730
You didn't call me here
for cocktails, Mr. Landsman.

31:58.753 --> 32:01.373
You're beginning to drive
me a little mad, Mr. Martin.

32:01.375 --> 32:02.774
Caused my men a lot of problems.

32:02.776 --> 32:03.808
Your men?

32:03.980 --> 32:05.676
Jetmir works for you?

32:05.678 --> 32:06.726
Of course he does.

32:06.749 --> 32:08.179
You worked that out yourself?

32:08.181 --> 32:11.016
Prostitution more profitable
than the movie business?

32:11.018 --> 32:13.584
More profitable more reliable and...

32:14.669 --> 32:16.659
perfectly legal in this country,

32:16.694 --> 32:17.964
which is nice.

32:18.561 --> 32:21.526
If you're not trafficking
in underage girls.

32:21.528 --> 32:22.753
These girls wanna work.

32:22.794 --> 32:24.762
Can I help it if they
lie about their age to me?

32:30.668 --> 32:31.803
Klara!

32:32.437 --> 32:33.841
Why set up Donne?

32:33.863 --> 32:36.240
You could blackmail any of
the celebrities at the parties.

32:36.242 --> 32:39.183
Donne's not a celebrity.
He's more valuable than that.

32:40.545 --> 32:42.182
He's a politician.

32:42.556 --> 32:44.982
Here for the Conference
on Human Trafficking.

32:44.984 --> 32:48.284
As I said, prostitution's
perfectly legal in this country.

32:48.504 --> 32:52.126
It does demand a steady
stream of young girls.

32:52.623 --> 32:54.290
So you squeeze him dry,

32:54.292 --> 32:58.061
and then use him to block any
laws that may prove to be...

32:58.796 --> 33:00.196
bothersome.

33:03.568 --> 33:06.635
Except we're not just talking
about prostitution, are we?

33:07.604 --> 33:09.505
We're talking about murder.

33:09.507 --> 33:11.853
- Who told you that?
- Does it matter?

33:11.904 --> 33:14.459
That girl was killed
the night of your party.

33:14.579 --> 33:16.015
If you say so.

33:30.293 --> 33:31.974
There you are!

33:32.328 --> 33:34.730
There's something going on in there.

33:36.065 --> 33:37.663
That makes Donne a killer.

33:37.672 --> 33:39.236
Doesn't look like a killer to me.

33:39.263 --> 33:41.218
But people can surprise you.

33:41.458 --> 33:44.613
Puts you in an awkward
position, doesn't it, Mr. Martin?

33:49.912 --> 33:51.480
And you also.

33:51.482 --> 33:53.515
Donne could very well
go to the authorities.

33:53.517 --> 33:54.849
If he's innocent.

33:54.851 --> 33:57.585
And then we'd all have
some explaining to do.

33:57.587 --> 33:58.754
After all,

33:58.781 --> 34:01.022
you helped him to destroy the evidence.

34:02.992 --> 34:05.330
I'm throwing a party tonight, Mr. Martin.

34:05.450 --> 34:08.762
Tell Donne to come and bring
the money he owes Jetmir,

34:08.764 --> 34:11.632
or that video will be
all over the internet.

34:18.106 --> 34:19.440
If they'd seen you,

34:19.442 --> 34:21.442
you would've blown everything!

34:38.426 --> 34:40.737
- That was close.
- She just took off.

34:40.755 --> 34:43.324
But Mariana is in there. I just know it.

34:46.233 --> 34:47.766
You're sure it's her?

34:48.569 --> 34:49.936
Pretty sure.

34:50.271 --> 34:52.168
You've got to go and check.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.641
We will.

34:55.543 --> 34:58.388
How'd you like to go to a party?

36:02.974 --> 36:04.416
Please.

36:06.886 --> 36:08.486
Good evening.

36:09.180 --> 36:11.230
Mr. and Mrs. Donne.

36:11.983 --> 36:13.717
Enjoy the party.

36:21.792 --> 36:24.355
You're supposed to have fun.

36:42.445 --> 36:44.184
There's Landsman.

36:45.582 --> 36:47.449
Enjoying the party.

36:49.687 --> 36:51.702
In boca lupo...

36:52.255 --> 36:53.760
Good luck.

37:34.896 --> 37:36.286
What?

37:36.853 --> 37:38.792
That son-of-a-bitch.

37:39.451 --> 37:41.168
Alright.

37:41.170 --> 37:43.831
Yeah, I'll be right there.

39:20.377 --> 39:21.584
Hey!

39:23.679 --> 39:25.362
Hey man...

40:45.681 --> 40:48.455
It's okay.

40:49.285 --> 40:50.559
Mariana?

40:53.856 --> 40:55.256
Is that your name?

40:55.258 --> 40:56.495
Mariana?

40:58.426 --> 41:00.334
I won't hurt you.

41:03.932 --> 41:04.928
Klara...

41:05.799 --> 41:06.845
Your sister...

41:06.860 --> 41:08.243
She sent me here.

41:10.038 --> 41:11.323
I'm Cat.

41:12.707 --> 41:14.441
Will you come with me?

41:17.312 --> 41:18.582
Come.

41:19.814 --> 41:21.524
Let's go. Come on.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.516
Trust me.

41:28.022 --> 41:29.355
I'll take you to her.

41:51.289 --> 41:53.404
We're getting out of here.

42:29.449 --> 42:30.792
You okay?

42:32.251 --> 42:33.251
Yes.

42:33.253 --> 42:35.823
Your sister was determined to find you.

42:36.856 --> 42:39.991
We really want to help
you and your sister, Klara.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.894
Can you help us with something?

42:42.896 --> 42:45.730
A man we know has been
accused of a terrible crime.

42:45.732 --> 42:48.566
Did you know a girl named Zeta?

42:48.568 --> 42:51.235
We saw a picture of her in a red dress.

42:51.237 --> 42:52.863
They killed her.

42:53.406 --> 42:55.706
She tried to escape and they shot her.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.357
Who shot her?

42:58.477 --> 42:59.595
Gary.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.716
- He told me call him Gary.
- Landsman.

43:02.742 --> 43:05.211
I saw him do it and I can
swear it to the police.

44:03.873 --> 44:05.294
You okay?

44:05.575 --> 44:07.050
Stay down!
