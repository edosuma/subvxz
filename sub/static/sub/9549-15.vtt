WEBVTT

00:08.795 --> 00:10.626
That was really fun
last night.

00:11.097 --> 00:13.190
I haven't been caroling
since, I don't know...

00:13.266 --> 00:15.200
Since college, I guess.

00:15.468 --> 00:16.799
I have to thank you
for that.

00:16.870 --> 00:17.859
For what?

00:17.937 --> 00:20.132
Well, just
making me do it.

00:20.740 --> 00:21.900
Getting me out
of the house.

00:21.975 --> 00:23.602
You're welcome.

00:23.877 --> 00:27.040
And I have to thank you
for that other thing, too.

00:27.113 --> 00:28.808
You know, marrying me.

00:28.882 --> 00:30.144
Oh, look.

00:31.217 --> 00:32.775
You're welcome.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.553
Did you ever hear
anything about that woman?

00:35.621 --> 00:36.952
What woman?

00:37.022 --> 00:38.649
Uh, the midwife,
Wendy-something?

00:38.724 --> 00:40.123
I overheard you
talking yesterday.

00:40.192 --> 00:42.752
Oh, Wendy Stroud.
No, no, no, not yet.

00:43.162 --> 00:45.687
No. It's been
three days,

00:45.764 --> 00:48.927
and it looks like
she's really missing.

00:49.802 --> 00:52.703
I was actually heading
down to the clinic now,

00:52.771 --> 00:54.636
talk to her boss.
Hmm.

00:55.741 --> 00:56.901
You forgot the onions.

00:56.975 --> 00:58.169
Did I?

00:58.844 --> 01:00.334
Are you okay?

01:02.548 --> 01:03.742
Trudy?

01:05.417 --> 01:06.406
You know,
it's really hard

01:06.485 --> 01:08.282
being married
to a detective.

01:08.353 --> 01:10.651
I never get to have
any secrets.

01:12.324 --> 01:13.791
I'm fine.
It's nothing.

01:13.859 --> 01:15.884
Just a little
overwhelmed.

01:16.261 --> 01:17.922
I got so much to do.

01:17.996 --> 01:20.191
Picking up medication
for Ambrose.

01:20.265 --> 01:21.357
The bills are due.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.094
I've got two articles
to proofread.

01:23.168 --> 01:24.294
There's just
not enough time.

01:24.369 --> 01:25.495
Okay.

01:27.272 --> 01:28.796
Wait a minute.

01:29.007 --> 01:30.372
That's new.

01:33.312 --> 01:36.008
Is this for me? Adrian, don't open that.

01:36.548 --> 01:38.880
I mean, come on,
it's a surprise.

01:40.419 --> 01:43.319
Promise me you won't
open it till Christmas.

01:45.490 --> 01:46.787
Okay, okay.

01:46.858 --> 01:49.952
I won't open the digital
watch. See, I'm putting it back.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.765
I love you.

01:58.336 --> 02:00.133
I can't imagine why.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074

02:25.897 --> 02:28.058
Is that you?
Hello?

03:26.089 --> 03:29.183
Wendy Stroud has worked
here for 19 years.

03:29.259 --> 03:30.886
She was the first midwife I hired.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.327
Uh-huh. She ever
disappear before?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.397
No. She's never
missed a day.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.127
She's never even been
late, hence the phone call.

03:38.201 --> 03:39.828
Hence we're here.

03:40.070 --> 03:41.332
Has anyone else
heard from her?

03:41.404 --> 03:42.496
Any of the
other nurses?

03:42.572 --> 03:43.800
No, nobody's
heard from her.

03:43.873 --> 03:46.103
And they're not nurses.
They're midwives. Right.

03:46.176 --> 03:48.144
There's a difference.
A midwife is a qualified

03:48.211 --> 03:49.701
autonomous practitioner,

03:49.779 --> 03:51.804
specializing in the
natural birth experience.

03:51.881 --> 03:52.905
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

03:52.983 --> 03:55.746
I was... I was straightening
it out a little bit.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.048
They're umbilical cords.
They're never straight.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.144
Bet his was.

04:00.656 --> 04:02.021
Excuse me.

04:05.027 --> 04:06.688
Yeah, he's right here.

04:10.065 --> 04:11.157
When?

04:12.001 --> 04:14.629
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be right there.

04:18.607 --> 04:20.507
Leland, what is it?

04:21.910 --> 04:23.537
Something happen?

04:28.651 --> 04:30.050
It's Trudy.

04:35.157 --> 04:37.250
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

04:37.593 --> 04:40.118
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

04:42.064 --> 04:44.225
<i>No one seems to care</i>

04:44.533 --> 04:45.557
<i>Well, I do</i>

04:45.634 --> 04:48.262
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

04:48.404 --> 04:50.395
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

04:52.207 --> 04:54.675
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

04:55.344 --> 04:57.744
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

04:57.980 --> 04:59.004
<i>Well, I do</i>

04:59.081 --> 05:01.674
<i>It's amazing</i>

05:02.317 --> 05:03.750
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

05:03.818 --> 05:05.445
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

05:05.520 --> 05:08.455
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

05:08.790 --> 05:10.121
<i>You better pay attention</i>

05:10.191 --> 05:12.625
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

05:13.161 --> 05:15.959
<i>might just kill you</i>

05:16.898 --> 05:18.763
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

05:19.167 --> 05:20.930
<i>But I don't think so</i>

05:21.002 --> 05:23.368
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

05:23.771 --> 05:25.705
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

05:45.355 --> 05:46.982
You don't have
to sleep like that.

05:47.624 --> 05:48.648
Like what?

05:48.725 --> 05:51.353
All scrunched up on
your side of the bed.

05:53.797 --> 05:56.322
You're sleeping
by yourself, Adrian.

05:57.134 --> 05:58.533
No, I'm not.

05:58.669 --> 06:00.569
Yes, you are,
my darling.

06:00.637 --> 06:02.662
And you have
the whole bed.

06:02.839 --> 06:05.034
You could sleep
in the middle.

06:09.946 --> 06:11.208
I can't.

06:12.148 --> 06:14.514
It's time to say
goodbye, Adrian.

06:15.785 --> 06:17.047
I can't.

06:20.456 --> 06:22.651
What? Why are
you smiling?

06:24.694 --> 06:26.628
It won't be
much longer.

06:45.982 --> 06:47.916
I'm really worried
about this dinner party.

06:47.984 --> 06:48.973
It's gonna be fine.

06:49.051 --> 06:50.143
I don't know what I'm
more nervous about,

06:50.219 --> 06:52.551
Steven meeting Julie
or Julie meeting Steven.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.111
You're still coming,
right? You promise?

06:54.190 --> 06:56.351
I'll be there.
Do you need anything?

06:56.425 --> 06:58.416
Oh! Thank you
for asking.

06:58.995 --> 07:00.053
Maybe some wine.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.619
Okay, red or white?

07:01.697 --> 07:04.063
Maybe red. Would you pick some up?

07:04.834 --> 07:06.199
Of course.

07:07.603 --> 07:09.366
I saw Trudy
this morning.

07:09.438 --> 07:10.803
Oh, that's a
good thing.

07:10.873 --> 07:11.897
No, this was different.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.464
She wanted me to start sleeping
in the middle of the bed,

07:14.542 --> 07:17.204
and she said,
"It won't be much longer. "

07:17.912 --> 07:19.004
Mr. Monk, really,
she said that?

07:19.080 --> 07:21.571
That... That's big.
That's an omen.

07:21.883 --> 07:25.114
I had a premonition you
were going to have an omen.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.955
I know that
building.

07:38.199 --> 07:39.530
Hey.

07:40.635 --> 07:42.296
Pretty weird, huh?

07:42.937 --> 07:44.234
What was it,
12 years ago?

07:44.305 --> 07:45.897
Almost exactly.

07:45.974 --> 07:48.135
The missing midwife,
remember?

07:50.578 --> 07:52.978
I was on the telephone
right here.

07:54.649 --> 07:57.846
And you were standing
there, that exact same spot.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.420
Hey, buddy, if you want to pass on
this one, nobody would blame you.

08:04.592 --> 08:06.457
No, no, I'm good.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.894
You sure? 'Cause
it gets weirder.

08:09.397 --> 08:11.160
Do you remember the
doctor we were talking to?

08:11.232 --> 08:13.257
Nash, right?
Malcolm Nash.

08:14.002 --> 08:15.492
He's our guest
of honor.

08:15.570 --> 08:16.969
Oh, my God.

08:23.811 --> 08:25.836
Don't ask.
Don't ask what?

08:25.913 --> 08:27.380
Where I've been.
Were you gone?

08:27.448 --> 08:30.076
Two weeks, on vacation,
but I can't talk about it.

08:30.150 --> 08:32.618
It's personal. Were you in New York?

08:33.220 --> 08:35.313
Your plane ticket
says Newark.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.754
Can't confirm or deny.

08:36.823 --> 08:38.347
You don't have to confirm
it. I can see your ticket.

08:38.424 --> 08:39.653
Well, you'll never know. I already know.

08:39.726 --> 08:41.284
I can see
your ticket.

08:41.361 --> 08:44.125
Natalie, I can't talk
about this right now.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.825
We're at a crime scene. Okay.

08:45.966 --> 08:48.958
So apparently,
he was here working late.

08:49.036 --> 08:50.731
I guess they're
updating their files.

08:50.804 --> 08:53.329
He was scanning all their old
paperwork into the computer.

08:53.907 --> 08:54.965
Scanning?

08:55.042 --> 08:56.600
Scanning the...

08:57.211 --> 08:59.611
Doesn't matter. Anyway,
he was at the computer.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.375
Somebody
sneaks in,

09:01.448 --> 09:03.746
comes up behind him,
bang, one in the back,

09:03.817 --> 09:05.546
bang, one in the head,
.22 caliber.

09:05.619 --> 09:07.018
There were some patients down the hall.

09:07.087 --> 09:08.076
Didn't hear a thing.

09:08.155 --> 09:10.055
Silencer.
A professional.

09:10.524 --> 09:11.752
That's a safe bet.

09:12.693 --> 09:14.354
They're all here.

09:14.628 --> 09:15.993
What's all here?

09:16.063 --> 09:17.087
Pill bottles.

09:17.164 --> 09:19.758
See, here's the
inventory, 58 bottles.

09:21.468 --> 09:23.265
And 58 bottles.

09:23.937 --> 09:26.302
He didn't take
anything with him.

09:26.606 --> 09:27.868
So it was a setup.

09:27.940 --> 09:30.067
He wants us
to think junkie.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.703
Looks like the killer
stuck around for a while.

09:32.778 --> 09:34.541
He used the computer.

09:34.614 --> 09:35.603
How do you know?

09:35.681 --> 09:37.478
The mouse is
on the left side,

09:37.550 --> 09:39.677
but Dr. Nash
is right-handed.

09:40.286 --> 09:41.310
How do you
know that?

09:41.387 --> 09:43.753
He was right-handed
12 years ago.

09:45.591 --> 09:46.649
That
was the first thing

09:46.726 --> 09:47.852
that Ethan said
when the Governor called.

09:47.927 --> 09:49.554
He didn't say,
"I won't let you down,"

09:49.629 --> 09:51.460
or, "Thank you for the
great honor. " He said...

09:51.531 --> 09:53.396
I said, "Do I have to
move to Sacramento?"

09:55.134 --> 09:57.762
Ethan will never move.
Here you go. Thank you.

09:57.837 --> 09:59.964
I think he's gonna
be buried in this yard.

10:00.039 --> 10:01.063
Well, I'm not gonna
move now.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.971
I just fixed the
leaky shower upstairs.

10:03.042 --> 10:05.010
And it only took you
14 years to do it.

10:05.077 --> 10:07.045
Judge Rickover,
the police are here.

10:07.113 --> 10:08.637
Oh, thank you.

10:09.549 --> 10:12.780
Well, the A-Team
has arrived.

10:13.119 --> 10:14.609
Captain.
Hey.

10:15.821 --> 10:17.516
Lieutenant.
Sir.

10:17.590 --> 10:18.921
Natalie.
Hello.

10:19.258 --> 10:20.953
And the remarkable
Mr. Monk.

10:21.027 --> 10:22.790
Good to see you again.

10:22.862 --> 10:24.295
Sorry to bug you
on a Sunday, Judge,

10:24.363 --> 10:27.389
but we've got a warrant here
that needs your signature.

10:27.466 --> 10:29.127
All right, well, I'm
familiar with the file.

10:29.202 --> 10:30.828
Wouldn't you like to
join us? Are you thirsty?

10:30.902 --> 10:33.166
Actually, we're
on duty, sir.

10:33.238 --> 10:35.365
Oh, well, of course
you are.

10:35.574 --> 10:37.508
Well, let me
take a look.

10:37.576 --> 10:39.339
Joey Kazarinski.

10:39.444 --> 10:41.344
Why am I not surprised?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.614
We sure it's him? Well, the MO matches.

10:43.682 --> 10:46.242
He's left-handed. He uses
a. 22 with a silencer.

10:46.318 --> 10:48.252
Plus we've got
a partial print.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.514
Monk put it
all together.

10:49.588 --> 10:51.579
Ah, well done,
Detective.

10:53.625 --> 10:54.990
Well, everything
looks in order.

10:55.060 --> 10:57.494
This is an historic
moment, really.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.524
This could be the last search
warrant I'll be signing.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.431
Please don't tell anyone.
It's not official yet.

11:03.501 --> 11:04.866
But the Governor
called me yesterday.

11:04.936 --> 11:07.427
He'd like me to commute
to Sacramento.

11:07.505 --> 11:09.700
Hey, state Supreme Court.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.171
Well, I guess it beats
working for a living.

11:12.244 --> 11:13.905
Congratulations. Good luck to you.

11:13.979 --> 11:14.968
Well, good luck
to all us.

11:15.046 --> 11:17.276
Congratulations, sir.
Thank you.

11:22.487 --> 11:24.045
Are they allowed
to do that?

11:24.122 --> 11:25.487
Let's see.

11:27.926 --> 11:29.018
Yes, they are.

11:29.094 --> 11:31.722
Mrs. Kazarinski, your
husband's in serious trouble.

11:31.796 --> 11:34.356
He's not my husband. Been
divorced for three years.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.922
But he stays here. Sometimes.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.691
Joey does
what he wants.

11:38.769 --> 11:41.237
I can't stop him,
and neither can you.

11:41.305 --> 11:43.637
Monk, what are you
doing? Straightening up.

11:43.707 --> 11:46.335
We're trying to
intimidate this woman.

11:46.577 --> 11:48.272
Give me a minute here.

11:48.345 --> 11:50.609
Where's Natalie? Oh,
she's with her boyfriend.

11:50.681 --> 11:52.205
I gave her the day off.

11:52.283 --> 11:53.307
Would you
cut it out?

11:53.384 --> 11:55.079
She's gonna want us
to come every Tuesday.

11:55.152 --> 11:57.052
Look, Edie, we're trying
to protect Joey here.

11:57.121 --> 11:58.520
If you tell us where he
is, we can pick him up

11:58.589 --> 12:00.250
without anybody
getting hurt.

12:00.324 --> 12:02.019
I don't care
if you kill him.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.491
Hope you do.

12:04.261 --> 12:06.320
Do you happen to have
a recent photograph?

12:06.397 --> 12:08.092
The one we have
is over 10 years old.

12:08.165 --> 12:11.191
Threw 'em out. Ripped
'em up and threw 'em out.

12:12.136 --> 12:14.331
Wait, I think
I have one left.

12:27.184 --> 12:28.981
He has
a white goatee.

12:30.921 --> 12:32.718
That's not a goatee.

12:43.499 --> 12:44.898
<i>Hello.
It's me.</i>

12:44.967 --> 12:46.400
Hey, where the
hell are you at?

12:46.469 --> 12:47.731
I've been waiting
like an hour.

12:47.804 --> 12:49.066
Change of plans.

12:49.138 --> 12:50.765
We won't be meeting again.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.899
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. At
least not in person.</i>

12:53.009 --> 12:53.998
Wait, is there
a problem?

12:54.077 --> 12:56.102
Yeah, we have
a big problem.

12:56.179 --> 12:58.170
You left a partial
fingerprint at the clinic.

12:58.247 --> 13:01.182
<i>They have your name.
They're looking for you.</i>

13:03.453 --> 13:05.250
It's gonna be okay, all
right? I've disappeared before.

13:05.321 --> 13:07.949
Before you pack your bags,
I've got another job for you.

13:08.024 --> 13:10.618
I figure you could use
another payday.

13:10.693 --> 13:11.682
All right, well,
who is it?

13:11.761 --> 13:13.092
<i>A detective.</i>

13:13.162 --> 13:14.686
A former detective.

13:14.764 --> 13:16.732
His name is Adrian Monk.

13:16.833 --> 13:19.427
<i>He's going to put two and two
together eventually.</i>

13:19.502 --> 13:21.629
In this case,
two and two equals me.

13:21.704 --> 13:23.831
I'm afraid it will get
rather personal.

13:23.906 --> 13:24.998
I can't afford that.

13:25.074 --> 13:26.200
What do you
mean, "personal"?

13:26.275 --> 13:29.335
<i>I mean he would come
after me, try to kill me.</i>

13:29.412 --> 13:30.777
<i>He'd probably succeed.</i>

13:30.847 --> 13:33.179
Now why would he want
to do something like that?

13:33.249 --> 13:35.149
Because 12 years ago,

13:36.119 --> 13:37.552
I killed his wife.

13:43.626 --> 13:45.719
Oh, this is
for Mr. Monk.

13:46.629 --> 13:48.187
This is for me.

13:48.597 --> 13:49.859
For Mr. Monk.

13:49.965 --> 13:51.489
This is for me.

13:51.633 --> 13:52.998
Mr. Monk.

13:53.068 --> 13:55.161
Me. Mr. Monk.

13:55.237 --> 13:57.171
I'm sorry, I don't get it.
Why two separate carts?

13:57.239 --> 13:59.230
Why can't we just separate
them when we get home?

13:59.307 --> 14:02.208
Yeah, I stopped asking those
questions a long time ago.

14:02.277 --> 14:03.972
Oh, honey mustard,
Julie's favorite.

14:04.045 --> 14:05.376
Mine too.
Really?

14:05.447 --> 14:07.540
That'll give you something
to talk about. Salad dressing.

14:07.616 --> 14:10.084
I hope we have more in
common than salad dressing.

14:10.152 --> 14:12.620
Teeger, relax.
It's gonna be great.

14:12.888 --> 14:15.356
I'm gonna love her. Yeah, you better.

14:15.424 --> 14:18.723
Besides, we both know we're
avoiding the real question here.

14:18.794 --> 14:20.261
Uh-huh, which is?

14:20.328 --> 14:21.852
Can I live with a woman
who loves asparagus?

14:21.930 --> 14:23.227
Live with?
I didn't mean...

14:23.298 --> 14:24.765
Live with, you said it. You said it.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.097
It's a figure of speech. You did.

14:27.369 --> 14:28.393
Oh, wait.

14:28.470 --> 14:29.801
Excuse me, sorry.

14:29.871 --> 14:31.202
That's our cart.

14:31.273 --> 14:32.433
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:32.507 --> 14:34.475
They, um... They all look the same.

14:34.543 --> 14:35.737
Yeah.

14:36.478 --> 14:38.412
Live with...

14:38.480 --> 14:41.176
You're not gonna let me
live this one down, are you?

14:44.085 --> 14:45.950
So it was a Christmas gift
from your wife?

14:46.021 --> 14:48.649
That's right. She gave it
to me just before she died.

14:48.723 --> 14:51.783
Yeah, it's just sitting
on his bookcase unopened.

14:51.860 --> 14:53.657
It's really romantic.

14:54.062 --> 14:56.086
I'll... I'll never open it.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.630
I can't open it.

14:57.698 --> 14:59.859
It's the last secret
we have.

14:59.934 --> 15:01.526
I think I understand.

15:01.602 --> 15:03.593
It's a way of
keeping her alive.

15:04.038 --> 15:05.300
Exactly.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.176
So, Julie, your mom says
you're going to Berkeley.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.040
Theater arts?
Yeah, that's the plan.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.578
You gonna live at home? Oh, no way.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.080
I'm already, you know,
all packed up.

15:15.149 --> 15:17.117
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about it.

15:17.184 --> 15:20.347
I can't believe she's
leaving the nest already.

15:20.421 --> 15:22.048
I'll only be
30 minutes away, so...

15:22.122 --> 15:24.454
This home will
just be a house.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.418
Well, thanks, Mom. That was
a real conversation-killer.

15:30.698 --> 15:33.690
So, Adrian, you working
on any interesting cases?

15:33.767 --> 15:36.201
Uh, there was a homicide
at a birthing center.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.395
Oh, that's ironic.

15:37.471 --> 15:39.371
It was a
professional hit.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.970
We know who did it,

15:42.176 --> 15:43.939
but we just don't...

15:45.346 --> 15:47.109
We just don't know why.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.051
Mr. Monk, are you okay?

15:52.486 --> 15:53.851
I'm fine.

15:55.089 --> 15:57.216
I guess I'm just
not hungry.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.715
I can usually
eat her food.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.096
Mr. Monk, please
stop. Please.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.067
There's a spot. It's
just not coming out.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.333
There's another spot, here.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.610
I'm seeing
spots all over.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.042
I think he's sick.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.878
Adrian.
Adrian, look at me.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.422
He's burning up.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.721
I think we should
get him to a hospital.

16:41.345 --> 16:42.437
We're gonna need
some blood.

16:42.513 --> 16:44.174
All right, Natalie,
give her some blood.

16:44.248 --> 16:45.374
I mean your blood.

16:45.449 --> 16:47.679
What are you doing?
What is that?

16:47.751 --> 16:50.276
It's just a needle.
That is not a needle.

16:50.354 --> 16:51.844
That thing's
10 feet long.

16:51.922 --> 16:53.355
You've never
given blood before?

16:53.424 --> 16:54.516
Nah.

16:55.359 --> 16:57.554
Well, you've had
shots before.

16:57.628 --> 16:59.289
I don't think so.

17:00.130 --> 17:02.462
Well, there's a first
time for everything.

17:02.533 --> 17:03.557
I need you to roll up your sleeve.

17:03.634 --> 17:05.829
Oh, no, no, no.
No! No!

17:06.303 --> 17:07.701
No, no.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.031
Can you please
hold your friend?

17:09.105 --> 17:11.767
It's okay. I got it. Wait, wait, wait.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.070
All right, wait, wait.

17:14.377 --> 17:15.810
I'm feeling better,
much...

17:15.878 --> 17:18.108
I'm feeling much, much
better. It's a miracle.

17:18.181 --> 17:19.704
No, Mr. Monk,
you're not better.

17:19.781 --> 17:22.342
They need some blood.
Come on, just lay back.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.045
No! Trust me, I'm a doctor.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.314
It's okay.
Trust me.

17:25.387 --> 17:26.513
Come on, it's okay.

17:26.589 --> 17:29.285
No, no, no. Who are you calling?

17:29.359 --> 17:31.156
Everybody. It's okay. It's okay.

17:31.427 --> 17:33.588
Let's try this again.

17:34.797 --> 17:35.889
No!

17:36.866 --> 17:37.992
Hold him still.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.898
Mr. Monk,
just calm down.

17:40.003 --> 17:41.368
It's okay.
Here we go.

17:41.437 --> 17:43.098
Here it is.
No!

17:43.940 --> 17:45.498
It's all right.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.240
You got it.

17:48.378 --> 17:49.436
All done.

17:52.949 --> 17:54.974
That wasn't so
bad, was it?

17:57.353 --> 17:58.877
Piece of cake.

18:06.930 --> 18:09.091
Mr. Monk, I'm
Dr. Matthew Shuler.

18:09.165 --> 18:10.189
Uh-huh.

18:10.266 --> 18:11.699
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.602
That's okay.

18:14.670 --> 18:15.932
It's okay.

18:16.004 --> 18:17.369
You know, I wish more people would wipe

18:17.439 --> 18:19.737
their hands like that. We'd
have a lot fewer patients.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.332
Oh, thank you.

18:22.878 --> 18:25.073
Mr. Monk, I work in the
Hematology Department here.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.240
In fact, I am the Hematology Department.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.511
Hematology?
Rare blood disorders.

18:29.584 --> 18:31.916
Dr. Shuler's one of the best
toxicologists in the country.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.251
Mr. Monk,
we've never met.

18:34.323 --> 18:35.620
How well do you
take bad news?

18:35.691 --> 18:37.090
Oh, not well at all.
Not good.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.956
I'm probably the worst.
Not good, not good.

18:39.027 --> 18:40.585
I'd rather hear
the good news first.

18:40.662 --> 18:41.959
I'm afraid there
is no good news.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.998
There's always good news.
People say, "I have

18:44.066 --> 18:46.398
"some good news
and some bad news. "

18:46.468 --> 18:47.992
Not this time.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.001
Mr. Monk, have you eaten
anything unusual lately?

18:55.811 --> 18:57.301
Why do you ask?

18:57.379 --> 18:59.313
Well, this is all
very preliminary,

18:59.381 --> 19:02.248
and we are gonna have
to run a lot more tests,

19:02.317 --> 19:04.683
but it looks like
Adrian's been poisoned.

19:04.753 --> 19:07.119
Poisoned?
I said well done!

19:07.189 --> 19:08.816
It was well done. You
should have seen it.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.448
It was still pink.
It was bleeding.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.685
I'm the worst cook
in the world.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.160
Mr. Monk, if I gave you
food poisoning, I'm so sorry.

19:14.229 --> 19:17.130
Can you forgive me? If you
gave me food poisoning, no.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.894
Listen, we're not talking
about food poisoning here.

19:19.967 --> 19:22.435
It is a lot more
serious than that.

19:22.937 --> 19:25.337
This is some kind
of synthetic toxin.

19:25.406 --> 19:26.430
Synthetic?

19:26.507 --> 19:28.270
Yes, and we don't know
how it was introduced,

19:28.342 --> 19:31.800
but we do know the dosage
is quite substantial.

19:32.246 --> 19:35.044
Well... What?
I don't understand.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.546
You've been
poisoned, Adrian.

19:40.121 --> 19:42.351
Somebody is trying
to kill you.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.184
And they may
have succeeded.

20:20.728 --> 20:22.855
I found some
more mouthwash.

20:30.703 --> 20:33.035
You want a seat? No, I'm okay.

20:34.174 --> 20:35.232
Have a seat.

20:35.308 --> 20:37.776
Okay, Randy,
I'm not pregnant.

20:37.844 --> 20:39.243
I'm just dying.

20:39.312 --> 20:40.939
Please stop
talking like that.

20:41.014 --> 20:43.244
I'll stop talking
soon enough.

20:44.017 --> 20:45.450
Oh, God, there he is.

20:46.052 --> 20:47.542
Here he comes.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.179
My God.

20:52.058 --> 20:54.788
God. I hate the
way they walk.

21:08.575 --> 21:11.305
This is the longest
hallway in the world.

21:12.912 --> 21:14.812
Hey, how you feeling? Oh!

21:15.882 --> 21:17.349
Um, scared.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.610
Yeah.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.877
Well, here's
what we know.

21:20.954 --> 21:22.444
Everybody ate the
same food at Natalie's,

21:22.522 --> 21:24.353
and nobody else
got sick.

21:24.424 --> 21:26.984
So we're assuming it
wasn't introduced there.

21:27.060 --> 21:28.493
I've sent a hazmat team
to your house,

21:28.561 --> 21:31.620
and they've taken away
all the food they can find.

21:31.697 --> 21:33.392
Are they gonna
put everything back?

21:33.465 --> 21:34.557
After we're done
testing it.

21:34.633 --> 21:35.657
Because I have
a system.

21:35.734 --> 21:38.328
Adrian, they're gonna put it
back exactly the way it was, okay?

21:38.403 --> 21:41.031
I promise. Now, I'm
afraid we still don't know

21:41.106 --> 21:42.937
how you were introduced to this toxin.

21:43.175 --> 21:44.506
Is that important?

21:44.576 --> 21:46.043
Yes, it's
absolutely vital.

21:46.111 --> 21:47.874
We know the toxin
in ricin-based,

21:47.946 --> 21:49.208
but that's all
we know.

21:49.281 --> 21:51.909
It could be one of
4,000 different compounds.

21:51.984 --> 21:54.976
We can't treat you until the source
of the poison has been identified.

21:55.053 --> 21:57.248
Can't you pump his stomach
or give him antibiotics?

21:57.322 --> 21:59.085
I'm afraid it's
not that easy.

21:59.158 --> 22:01.718
We need to identify
the specific toxin.

22:03.762 --> 22:05.354
Now, of course we'll
try to manage your pain

22:05.430 --> 22:06.988
as best we can.

22:07.966 --> 22:09.092
So...

22:09.201 --> 22:10.463
How long?

22:12.638 --> 22:15.232
Two, maybe three days.

22:17.176 --> 22:20.771
Now, you're gonna feel
normal for a while,

22:20.846 --> 22:23.508
and then there's gonna be some vomiting,

22:23.749 --> 22:25.410
followed by death.

22:31.790 --> 22:34.190
Vomiting?
That's right.

22:35.093 --> 22:36.788
Followed by death.

22:38.329 --> 22:39.489
Vomiting.

22:39.564 --> 22:41.896
Yes. Followed by death.

22:43.267 --> 22:45.167
Vomiting!

22:45.303 --> 22:46.964
Adrian, I really
need you to focus

22:47.038 --> 22:49.506
on the last part
of that sentence.

22:49.574 --> 22:51.769
There's gonna be
some vomiting

22:51.842 --> 22:53.002
and then death.

22:53.077 --> 22:54.840
Is there any chance

22:55.112 --> 22:58.138
death could come
before the vomiting?

23:00.384 --> 23:01.749
Two days?

23:01.919 --> 23:03.511
Wish it were five.

23:03.721 --> 23:04.813
Why?

23:06.023 --> 23:08.150
'Cause it's a
bigger number.

23:08.593 --> 23:10.083
What is this?

23:10.761 --> 23:12.729
That's the suspect from
the birthing center.

23:12.797 --> 23:14.059
We're still tracking
him down.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.120
Birthing center?

23:15.199 --> 23:17.690
Natalie, we've got more
important things to worry...

23:17.768 --> 23:19.030
No, no, no, I've seen him before.

23:19.103 --> 23:21.128
He was at the
supermarket.

23:21.339 --> 23:22.397
When was this?
Yesterday.

23:22.473 --> 23:24.668
He walked away with
Mr. Monk's shopping cart.

23:24.742 --> 23:27.142
Shopping cart? Yeah, he had
it for 10, maybe 20 seconds.

23:27.211 --> 23:29.645
Well, that's long enough. I mean, he
could have put something in the cart,

23:29.714 --> 23:31.147
tampered with something.

23:31.215 --> 23:32.477
Do you still have
the receipt?

23:32.550 --> 23:33.539
Yeah, I think so.

23:33.618 --> 23:34.949
Okay, listen,
we're gonna start there.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.510
We'll test every single
item that was on that list.

23:37.588 --> 23:39.385
Is there
enough time?

23:39.757 --> 23:41.247
I don't know.

23:50.484 --> 23:51.746
Thank you for coming.

23:51.819 --> 23:53.684
I have to tell you
right off the bat

23:53.754 --> 23:56.621
that is not an officially
sanctioned task force,

23:56.690 --> 23:58.715
so nobody's gonna
get paid any overtime.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.123
We're not here
for the money, Captain.

24:01.628 --> 24:04.222
I appreciate that.
I'm sure Monk does, too.

24:04.298 --> 24:07.825
All right, this is our
target, Joey Kazarinski.

24:07.901 --> 24:09.892
A.k. a., Joey Kaz
or Joey K.

24:09.970 --> 24:13.303
We think that Kazarinski
shot Dr. Nash last Friday,

24:13.373 --> 24:16.399
and we think that he
poisoned Adrian Monk.

24:16.610 --> 24:17.668
What's the connection?

24:17.745 --> 24:19.235
Monk was working
the Nash case.

24:19.313 --> 24:21.144
Other than that,
we don't know.

24:21.215 --> 24:22.910
Now, we're gonna
split up into groups.

24:22.983 --> 24:24.951
Half of you are gonna work
with Randy on the shooting.

24:25.018 --> 24:26.542
They know who
you are, Randy.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.485
I want to know everything
there is to know about Nash,

24:28.555 --> 24:30.455
who he was,
who loved him,

24:30.524 --> 24:32.924
more importantly,
who didn't love him.

24:32.993 --> 24:34.790
The rest of us are
gonna find Kazarinski.

24:34.862 --> 24:37.296
We're gonna turn over every
rock in Northern California.

24:37.498 --> 24:38.965
Now, this guy
is dangerous.

24:39.032 --> 24:40.192
He is armed.

24:40.267 --> 24:42.098
He might be carrying
chemical agents,

24:42.169 --> 24:45.104
so be careful, but, and
this is very important,

24:45.172 --> 24:46.298
no guns.

24:46.373 --> 24:47.670
You get a lead,
you phone it in.

24:47.741 --> 24:49.708
You keep your gun
in your belt.

24:49.776 --> 24:51.004
He must be taken alive.

24:51.077 --> 24:53.204
If he dies, Monk dies.

24:53.679 --> 24:55.647
Understood?
Good deal, let's go.

26:00.745 --> 26:02.406
They'll find him.

26:23.768 --> 26:25.793
You were with
Kazarinski yesterday.

26:25.871 --> 26:27.702
We know that you
sold him some fake ID.

26:27.772 --> 26:30.002
What was it, a driver's
license? Passport?

26:30.075 --> 26:32.737
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:34.312 --> 26:38.043
Ronnie, I don't have time
to dance with you today.

26:38.116 --> 26:39.947
My friend is sick.
Do you understand?

26:40.018 --> 26:41.508
Your friend is sick,
what does that mean?

26:41.586 --> 26:43.850
It means that I
need that name.

26:44.623 --> 26:48.821
I need to know the name that
Joey Kazarinski is using now.

26:49.961 --> 26:51.622
You need a name?

26:51.963 --> 26:53.555
What are you gonna do?

26:53.632 --> 26:55.657
Hit me with a phone book?

26:55.800 --> 26:57.427
There are no phone books
in here, Captain.

26:57.502 --> 26:59.333
Nobody uses phone
books anymore.

26:59.404 --> 27:01.304
They all use computers.

27:04.575 --> 27:06.338
Yeah, you're right.

27:12.016 --> 27:14.280
Did you get a name?
Yes, I did.

27:14.652 --> 27:16.677
Oh, your
computer crashed.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.390
<i>5:24 limited
train to Redwood City,</i>

27:25.462 --> 27:29.296
<i>Menlo Park, and points south
now boarding at gate 3.</i>

27:29.833 --> 27:32.825
<i>The 5:24 limited, gate
3, is now boarding.</i>

27:37.741 --> 27:40.039
<i>Mason, can you
see the ticket booth?</i>

27:40.110 --> 27:42.271
<i>Roger that. Maintain your sight line.</i>

27:42.346 --> 27:45.179
<i>His train is leaving in ten
minutes. He'll be here soon.</i>

27:45.249 --> 27:47.183
Remember, hit him hard, but no guns.

27:47.251 --> 27:49.742
Keep your guns
in your holsters.

27:51.789 --> 27:53.552
What about
that service entrance?

27:53.624 --> 27:56.286
We got it covered,
the whole perimeter.

27:57.227 --> 27:59.661
He's not gonna show.
He's gonna show.

27:59.730 --> 28:00.719
He made his
reservation.

28:00.798 --> 28:02.891
The train will be
here in 10 minutes.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.699
He'll be here.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.895
<i>The 5:27 limited
from Oakland,</i>

28:06.971 --> 28:10.337
<i>Berkeley, and points north
arriving at gate 6.</i>

28:11.007 --> 28:13.976
<i>The 5:27 limited
arriving at gate 6.</i>

28:23.419 --> 28:24.408
Yeah, I got nothing,

28:33.730 --> 28:35.527
He's not gonna show.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.302
I'm gonna
miss all this.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.764
You going somewhere?

28:42.839 --> 28:45.364
No, no. You know,
I mean eventually.

28:46.542 --> 28:48.407
Can't do this forever.

28:58.254 --> 29:00.984
That's the 5:32
from San Jose.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.255
Yeah, right on time.

29:05.395 --> 29:08.262
Listen. I don't hear anything.

29:08.631 --> 29:09.962
Me neither.

29:10.033 --> 29:11.625
There was no
announcement.

29:11.701 --> 29:12.759
Where's the announcer?

29:12.835 --> 29:14.631
Control tower. Go. Go.

29:16.038 --> 29:17.562
I think we may
have a 20 on the suspect.

29:17.639 --> 29:19.504
Everybody hold
your positions.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.888
Captain, the controller's
dead. He's been shot,

29:43.965 --> 29:46.058
<i>once in the back,
once in the head.</i>

29:46.134 --> 29:48.159
<i>And there's lots of blood. Randy.</i>

29:48.270 --> 29:49.862
<i>Randy, the microphone
is still on.</i>

29:49.938 --> 29:51.929
So much blood in here.
God, look at all the blood.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.998
Randy, the
microphone's still on.

29:54.076 --> 29:56.067
What? The microphone, it's still on.

29:56.144 --> 29:57.941
I can still hear you.

29:58.346 --> 29:59.973
No, wait, wait, hang on.
Hang on.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.141
<i>I can still hear you.
Randy, it's still on.</i>

30:02.217 --> 30:04.276
No, no, I got it.
I got it.

30:06.354 --> 30:08.413
Kazarinski took his
jacket and his ID.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.924
<i>Think we should make an
announcement and warn everybody,</i>

30:10.992 --> 30:13.426
<i>otherwise they might just be
sitting ducks down there.</i>

30:13.495 --> 30:14.723
<i>Captain?</i>

30:15.464 --> 30:17.022
<i>He's got a gun.
He's killed once.</i>

30:17.099 --> 30:19.067
<i>He won't hesitate
to do it again.</i>

30:34.348 --> 30:35.747
Kazarinski!

30:36.383 --> 30:37.577
Police!

30:39.120 --> 30:40.747
Look out, police!

30:48.262 --> 30:49.388
Joey.

30:53.834 --> 30:54.960
Joey.

30:57.938 --> 30:59.337
Joey, stop.

31:08.282 --> 31:09.681
Kazarinski!

31:26.966 --> 31:29.196
Joey.

31:44.317 --> 31:45.306
Stop!

32:12.645 --> 32:13.771
Joey!

32:15.215 --> 32:16.614
Kazarinski!

32:39.771 --> 32:41.295
Joey, look out!

32:43.308 --> 32:44.434
Damn!

32:51.883 --> 32:52.872
Joey!

33:16.775 --> 33:18.242
The man who
poisoned you,

33:18.310 --> 33:21.609
this Kazarinski, did he
say anything before he died?

33:22.214 --> 33:24.978
He was hit
by a train.

33:25.917 --> 33:27.441
He probably

33:27.653 --> 33:29.644
said, "Train. "

33:30.989 --> 33:32.980
They know what kind
of poison he used?

33:33.058 --> 33:36.619
No, they found the
motel room he was using.

33:36.695 --> 33:38.889
There were some
chemicals in the dumpster,

33:38.963 --> 33:42.057
but it'll take them weeks
to analyze everything.

33:42.266 --> 33:44.393
There isn't enough time.

33:45.269 --> 33:47.362
How about the food
from your shopping cart?

33:47.438 --> 33:51.704
No. All negative.
No trace of anything.

33:53.044 --> 33:55.171
Adrian, I could have
met you at home

33:55.246 --> 33:56.941
or at the hospital,
you know.

33:57.014 --> 33:59.676
Nah, it's all right.
I was out anyway.

33:59.750 --> 34:03.083
Natalie's driving me to
the cemetery to say goodbye.

34:04.121 --> 34:08.522
I'm just so sorry.

34:08.592 --> 34:10.560
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

34:10.628 --> 34:13.152
I have everything
to be sorry about.

34:15.099 --> 34:17.795
I've lived
like a prisoner.

34:18.703 --> 34:22.230
I've been a prisoner
ever since Trudy.

34:23.306 --> 34:26.242
I've wasted
so much time.

34:27.878 --> 34:29.368
Just add it up.

34:30.947 --> 34:33.507
I've probably
wasted three years

34:34.051 --> 34:36.042
just washing
these hands.

34:37.154 --> 34:40.748
Wait. Adrian, you're not being fair.

34:41.359 --> 34:42.690
You know, you've been...

34:42.760 --> 34:45.626
You are more productive
than anyone I know.

34:46.362 --> 34:48.853
You've solved
over 120 major cases.

34:48.931 --> 34:52.197
I didn't solve anything
if I didn't solve Trudy.

34:53.103 --> 34:55.697
If I didn't keep
that promise to her,

34:57.407 --> 34:59.272
didn't solve anything.

35:01.811 --> 35:03.802
I've always hated
that painting.

35:04.314 --> 35:07.078
All right, well,
I'm not giving up.

35:07.817 --> 35:10.547
Doctors are performing
miracles every day.

35:10.620 --> 35:14.716
So, I'm just gonna put all
your appointments in my book.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.850
Three, four, five weeks
ahead of time.

35:16.926 --> 35:20.453
All right, Adrian Monk,
Monday, 11:00 a. m.

35:20.530 --> 35:23.021
Adrian Monk, yeah?
And Wednesday...

35:24.267 --> 35:25.495
You're using a pencil.

35:25.568 --> 35:28.401
...9:00 a. m. Oh! That
doesn't mean anything.

35:28.471 --> 35:31.201
You never
use a pencil.

35:31.274 --> 35:32.832
I didn't have a pen.

35:32.909 --> 35:36.174
It's right there.
Your pen is right there.

35:36.513 --> 35:39.311
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

35:39.783 --> 35:41.444
It doesn't even...

35:42.986 --> 35:44.476
My time is up.

35:45.221 --> 35:47.519
Ha! My time is up.

35:48.191 --> 35:49.385
Get it?

35:55.431 --> 35:57.160
Goodbye, Dr. Bell.

35:59.501 --> 36:02.470
No, Adrian, it's not
goodbye. Never goodbye.

36:03.472 --> 36:04.734
Goodbye.

36:25.127 --> 36:26.617
Did you talk
to the lab?

36:26.695 --> 36:29.823
Yeah, I just got off
the phone with them.

36:30.299 --> 36:32.199
He's not gonna make it.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.211
Should I shut the door? I don't care.

36:54.656 --> 36:57.089
Let 'em fire me.
I wish they would.

37:00.094 --> 37:01.857
I had him all wrong.

37:07.168 --> 37:08.760
I know that now.

37:10.671 --> 37:12.070
I'd always thought
that Monk

37:14.008 --> 37:15.600
was not all there,

37:17.378 --> 37:19.107
like there was
something missing,

37:19.180 --> 37:21.273
like he was less
than human.

37:27.488 --> 37:29.581
But he wasn't
missing anything.

37:29.657 --> 37:32.592
He was seeing
more than anybody.

37:33.427 --> 37:35.759
He was feeling
more than anybody.

37:38.432 --> 37:40.229
That was his problem.

37:42.069 --> 37:43.696
He was too human.

37:49.010 --> 37:51.911
If we had more like him,
we'd be better off.

38:28.982 --> 38:30.347
I love you.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.253
Is that it?

38:37.123 --> 38:39.956
Sure you don't want
to say something else?

38:40.126 --> 38:42.594
No, I can tell her
myself tomorrow.

38:55.454 --> 38:58.446
Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk,
that was Dr. Shuler.

38:59.158 --> 39:01.183
He really thinks you need
to be in the hospital.

39:01.260 --> 39:03.592
No, I'm staying here.

39:05.331 --> 39:07.856
Okay. Then we'll
stay here.

39:08.334 --> 39:10.858
Can I get you anything?
How about some tea?

39:10.936 --> 39:12.130
Uh-uh.

39:12.537 --> 39:13.765
Just...

39:15.173 --> 39:17.368
Trudy's gift.

39:23.949 --> 39:25.610
No, Mr. Monk, no.

39:26.184 --> 39:27.549
It's time.

39:29.521 --> 39:30.749
Please.

39:32.524 --> 39:34.151
Natalie, it's...

39:34.659 --> 39:35.990
It's time.

40:47.965 --> 40:49.626
It's a videotape.

41:18.162 --> 41:19.993
<i>Hello, Adrian.</i>

41:21.264 --> 41:24.131
<i>If you're watching this,
it means I'm dead.</i>

41:25.735 --> 41:27.896
<i>I know we said we'd never

41:27.970 --> 41:31.667
<i>but there's something
I never told you.</i>

41:33.843 --> 41:35.572

before we met.</i>
