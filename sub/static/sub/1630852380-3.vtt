WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:03.795
Previously on Dynasty…
First, you stole my job at

00:03.837 --> 00:06.006
Flores Incorparado, now you're
cutting me off completely?

00:06.047 --> 00:08.133
Perhaps, if someone
from the board

00:08.174 --> 00:10.844
were to step in as acting CEO,
just while you recover,

00:10.885 --> 00:13.179
to show stability
on Wall Street.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.681
I'm dropping out of the race.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.890
You'll be able to get
an even better deal

00:15.932 --> 00:17.976
from that lieutenant governor.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.145
Why are you so hell-bent on
trying to pin this murder on me?

00:20.186 --> 00:21.896
You're the one with the motive.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.815
I've just seen a drone
flying by,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.316
and it looked like
it was recording.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.693
This seat taken?

00:26.735 --> 00:27.610
You remind me of someone
I used to know.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.696
(glasses clink)

00:29.738 --> 00:31.990
FALLON: You're probably
thinking I should take it easy, but

00:32.032 --> 00:34.367
since today is my first day
back at work,

00:34.409 --> 00:36.453
and tomorrow night
is the Carrington Gala,

00:36.494 --> 00:39.122
your girl's coming in
guns a-blazing.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.457
Oh. Oh!

00:40.498 --> 00:42.542
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.252
I'm fine. I-I-I
just didn't think

00:44.294 --> 00:45.628
that you were gonna…

00:45.670 --> 00:48.006
Liam, Liam, relax, okay?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.008
The infection is gone.
It's been a week.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.218
You're not gonna bump me back
into a coma. I-I-I just want to make sure

00:52.260 --> 00:55.138
that you're not pushing
it too hard. I get it.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.099
You're concerned
and being weirdly polite,

00:58.141 --> 00:59.934
which is super nice,
but weird. I just,

00:59.976 --> 01:02.562
I wasn't looking, and I turned
right into you, and I know,

01:02.604 --> 01:05.315
which probably shouldn't
happen in a room this big.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.108
Yeah, the room is big.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.278
Big enough for that giant
elephant to fit inside of it.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.781
Metaphorical.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.617
And I'm thinking I should
address it, so…

01:15.658 --> 01:18.369
we haven't had sex since
I got out of the hospital.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.580
Oh…

01:20.622 --> 01:22.332
that elephant. I mean,

01:22.373 --> 01:24.793
I feel like that's normal
following a coma,

01:24.834 --> 01:26.461
which followed
a gunshot wound, right?

01:26.503 --> 01:28.671
I haven't read the literature

01:28.713 --> 01:30.548
on this exact scenario,

01:30.590 --> 01:32.509
but, yeah, I'm sure it's common.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.594
You've been through a lot.
It might take time.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.180
Well, we've been through a lot.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.349
Yes, and we

01:39.390 --> 01:41.184
have nothing to worry about.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.394
Well, good. Then I won't worry.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.855
Good. Me neither.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.149
Great, so we're both
unworried then? Mm-hmm.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.819
Okay. I'm gonna go see my baby.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.321
(kisses)

01:53.363 --> 01:54.322
My company.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.574
Oh.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.992
Bye.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.078
BLAKE:
I'm dropping out of the race

02:00.120 --> 02:03.915
for senator, and even though
I'm ahead in the polls,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.793
I'm a man of my word.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.545
I only want what we agreed to.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.547
I get my land for the airport

02:10.588 --> 02:12.841
and concessions
for Clarke County.

02:12.882 --> 02:15.593
You and the governor
get Cavendish for senator.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.972
Yes, I remember that deal
being on the table.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.850
Here's the thing,
it's now off the table.

02:23.393 --> 02:24.352
I'm sorry.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.437
I'm-I'm not following.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.189
I'm happy to spell it
out for you.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.191
Our polling shows
your lead slipping.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.986
You got a "shot daughter" bump,
but unless

02:33.027 --> 02:34.070
she gets shot again, that bump

02:34.112 --> 02:35.655
will be gone by Election Day,

02:35.697 --> 02:36.948
and since we're confident
Cavendish will now win,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.659
there's no need
to make a deal with you.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.246
I respect the hardball approach.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.124
I basically invented it myself.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.626
My polling tells
a different story,

02:48.668 --> 02:50.795
but I am willing
to amend our deal.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.839
Amend what deal?

02:52.881 --> 02:54.549
Are we negotiating or not?

02:54.591 --> 02:57.427
I'm gonna go with "not," but

02:57.468 --> 02:59.721
have a good day.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.141
The thought of spending decades
in this hellhole

03:03.183 --> 03:04.559
is aging me by the minute.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.019
If I don't get out

03:06.060 --> 03:07.437
of here soon,
I am going to lose my mind

03:07.478 --> 03:08.479
and my natural glow.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.981
Okay, well, I have some news

03:10.023 --> 03:11.774
that might cheer you up.
You're busting me out?

03:11.816 --> 03:14.694
Or are you and I trading places,
like a Parent Trap deal?

03:14.736 --> 03:16.529
I'm not busting you out,

03:16.571 --> 03:18.281
but I was at the penthouse
the other night,

03:18.323 --> 03:21.451
and I saw a drone
fly past the balcony.

03:21.492 --> 03:24.287
How does you seeing a UFO

03:24.329 --> 03:25.955
help get me out of prison?

03:25.997 --> 03:28.583
It was a drone,
and it had a camera attached.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.251
Apparently, it's been flying by

03:30.293 --> 03:31.878
every night
for the past few weeks.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.504
So, if the drone
somehow recorded footage

03:33.546 --> 03:34.923
of Bobby Larson's murder,

03:34.964 --> 03:36.633
even in the background,

03:36.674 --> 03:38.009
it could tell us
what happened that night.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.345
Okay, so how does one
retrieve a drone?

03:40.386 --> 03:41.512
Call the drone police?

03:41.554 --> 03:43.556
No. Whoever owns it lives

03:43.598 --> 03:45.266
in the building across
the street, so I just

03:45.308 --> 03:46.893
have to work out
where it flies back to.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.853
Well…

03:48.895 --> 03:50.480
this is almost as good
as switching places.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.815
You shouldn't be sitting here
chatting with me.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.901
You need to catch
a drone. Guard!

03:54.943 --> 03:58.071
Chop, chop. Oh, my God.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.614
I've got big news to share.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.449
Ooh, I love big news. Same.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.493
Go big or go home.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.412
Oh, could you please not lick
the jelly off of your fingers

04:06.454 --> 04:07.538
in front of me?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.249
It's unsanitary and disgusting.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.334
A, it's jam,

04:11.376 --> 04:13.628
which is delicious on anything,
especially a finger.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.423
And B, I hope your news
is better than your attitude.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.551
Okay. I am getting married.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.512
What? To who?

04:22.553 --> 04:26.015
Whom. And no idea, yet.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.560
Okay, between the jam thing and
this, you sound a little insane.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.020
I was just with my mother,

04:31.062 --> 04:32.355
who was getting on my case
about dating,

04:32.397 --> 04:33.648
when I had an epiphany.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.608
I'm over being alone

04:35.650 --> 04:38.611
and chasing women
and then running away.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.780
That very mature of you,
Michael Culhane. I'm impressed.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.866
Yeah, I'm ready for the
"real love" phase of my life.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.077
I want to meet my partner.
My "one."

04:46.119 --> 04:48.121
I feel like my baby brother
is finally growing up.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.081
I'm older than you.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.251
Whatever. Point is, Kirby and I
are more than happy to help you

04:53.293 --> 04:54.794
find your soul
mate. Absolutely.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.255
I don't remember
asking you for help. Well,

04:57.297 --> 05:00.425
true friends can hear a call for
help even when it's unspoken.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.885
You're welcome.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.804
Definitely have to redecorate.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.265
I need a new vibe in here.
Starting with that couch.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.059
Can we get on that
immediately, please, um… Betty.

05:10.101 --> 05:13.313
Ms. Carrington. Betty. And you

05:13.354 --> 05:15.690
have a very different vibe,
which is super comforting

05:15.732 --> 05:17.275
to me. Ooh!

05:17.317 --> 05:20.361
I can already feel
the corporate warfare racing

05:20.403 --> 05:21.779
through my veins, and, God,

05:21.821 --> 05:23.239
do I love it. Right.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.241
Uh, so you have some FSN
business

05:25.283 --> 05:26.451
that needs your attention.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.286
Yes. New talent negotiations.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.871
Start rolling calls
with the lawyers

05:29.912 --> 05:31.289
and let the battles begin.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.707
I'm sure I'll tire

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
of the military
metaphors eventually,

05:34.083 --> 05:35.460
but for now,
let's just roll with it.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.420
Aye-aye. Ah, there you go.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.463
(gasps) Ellen!

05:38.504 --> 05:40.798
Wow. First, the hospital,

05:40.840 --> 05:42.425
now the office. I am touched

05:42.467 --> 05:44.510
that a board member has come

05:44.552 --> 05:46.721
to welcome me back,
even without a muffin basket.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.223
I didn't bring muffins,
and, unfortunately,

05:49.265 --> 05:50.892
I'm not here
to welcome you back, Fallon.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.143
You need to leave.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.978
I'm sorry? So am I,

05:54.020 --> 05:56.481
but it was in the email
you clearly never read.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.608
Well, yeah,
I get a lot of emails.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.819
(scoffs) Our insurance carrier
is forbidding you

06:01.861 --> 06:04.989
from returning to work until you
can pass all health protocols.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.992
You're a liability. A liability?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.328
My doctor said that I am fine,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.622
and it's Fallon Unlimited,

06:12.663 --> 06:15.249
not "Board Members Unlimited."

06:15.291 --> 06:16.793
I thought that this
would be an issue.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.754
You're now on a mandatory
medical leave.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.881
You are legally forbidden
from conducting

06:21.923 --> 06:23.424
company business. (Scoffs)

06:23.466 --> 06:25.134
Well, you can force me to leave,

06:25.176 --> 06:27.387
but you can't stop me
from working at home.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.055
We're shutting down
your business email,

06:29.097 --> 06:30.556
phone and access.
And if you're caught

06:30.598 --> 06:32.683
breaking any rules,

06:32.725 --> 06:35.603
we'll take action
to remove you as CEO.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.189
Well, then I am going to call

06:38.231 --> 06:39.941
our insurance company right now

06:39.982 --> 06:41.818
and file an appeal. Appeal?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.027
Off the premises.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.153
Please.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.738
Hey!

06:45.780 --> 06:47.990
Whoa. Take it easy.
I'm a liability, remember?

06:48.032 --> 06:49.909
Hey, Ellen, this is not over.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.829
You may have won the battle,
but you will not win the war.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.207
Killing it, Betty.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.234
This is my fault.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.361
If I had just let you drop out
when you wanted,

07:25.403 --> 07:27.238
the land for the airfield
would be yours.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.199
Honey, it's not your fault
that Lipnicki's an ass.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.952
He blindsided me. I'm still
dropping out of the race.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.079
Then why are we looking
at this map at all?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.789
Oh, I'm building that airfield.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.000
I just have to find
another way to get my land.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.168
So, you're giving up
on the deal?

07:40.209 --> 07:41.627
Honey, it's dead.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.464
That deal isn't dead
until we say it is.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.632
Let's push back
against that guy.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.927
Maybe blackmail him
into honoring it.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.638
Hmm. You taught me
that's Carrington 101.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.057
Well, I'm glad you're paying
attention, and I love the way

07:55.099 --> 07:56.517
you're thinking, but

07:56.559 --> 07:58.102
Lipnicki is squeaky clean.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.312
No one is squeaky clean.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.147
I want you

08:01.189 --> 08:02.648
to close your eyes for me

08:02.690 --> 08:05.318
and visualize Lipnicki's office.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.487
(sighs) Now, tell
me what you see.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.241
I see a bunch of pictures.
Uh… his wife.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.703
Um… some people skiing,

08:15.745 --> 08:17.413
uh, his fraternity brothers,

08:17.455 --> 08:19.707
Lipnicki and the governor.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.042
Perfect.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.544
We have everything
we need. We do?

08:23.586 --> 08:26.255
Fraternity brothers?
It's almost too easy.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.716
Ah.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.510
Every time I think I know

08:30.551 --> 08:33.262
all about you,
you show me one…

08:33.304 --> 08:34.680
hotter side.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.769
As you requested, my list
of soul mate requirements.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.023
Five-eight or taller.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.733
Physically fit.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.360
Artistic. Multi-lingual.

08:47.401 --> 08:50.238
How many languages
can you speak?

08:50.279 --> 08:52.365
One, which is why
she needs to speak multiple.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.368
Impeccable manners. I can't believe
you allowed yourself to date me.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.411
Who knew you were so
picky? MICHAEL: Not picky,

08:57.453 --> 08:59.455
just high standards.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.207
My parents
had a magical relationship,

09:01.249 --> 09:02.291
and I want nothing less.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.543
We're not magicians.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.378
We'll find you a woman.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.088
I already have one in mind.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.965
I'll set it up tomorrow,
if you're ready to go.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.842
Well, I guess you can't find the
one unless you meet the one, so

09:11.884 --> 09:14.262
let's make the magic happen.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.596
Can I talk to you for a minute?

09:15.638 --> 09:17.473
Always. What's on your mind?

09:17.515 --> 09:21.060
Well, now what's on my mind
is you being undressed in here.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.604
Were you just…
No. I don't want to know. Okay.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.941
I need advice. My board has put
me on temporary medical leave,

09:26.983 --> 09:28.901
and I want to know how I can
circumvent their decision.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.987
Well, that's easy. You can't.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.780
That's your advice?

09:32.822 --> 09:34.657
I once worked nonstop
for two weeks,

09:34.699 --> 09:36.284
doubled over, waiting for
a kidney stone to pass.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.286
No one cared.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.537
That's what happens when you
take your company public.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.830
You got to answer to the public.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.707
Well, no offense
to your slow-rolling

09:42.748 --> 09:44.500
kidney stone,
but I do not accept

09:44.542 --> 09:47.128
your non-advice, and I'm gonna
need this office back now.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.769
(chuckles) That's not happening.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.930
Hey, hey, is something else
bothering you?

09:53.884 --> 09:55.678
Is it Liam?
How are things with him?

09:55.720 --> 09:59.015
Well, your fatherly instincts
are better than your advice.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.517
Things with Liam are…

10:01.559 --> 10:02.893
weird.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.771
They're good,
but not normal good.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.274
It's like we're walking
on eggshells, on ice.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.568
Well, you know, the more time
you spend together,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.695
the more it will feel
like it did pre-coma.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.448
Yeah. How are
things in the bedroom?

10:15.489 --> 10:18.242
Now your fatherly instincts
are making me want to throw up.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.244
Mm. Not in my office.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.538
Though, the idea of spending
more time together

10:22.580 --> 10:25.791
isn't terrible, maybe
that'll help break the ice.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.418
Well, I'm glad I
could help. No.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.545
Keeping your clothes on
around the manor,

10:29.587 --> 10:30.921
that's more helpful.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.676
Liam, I have an idea.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.762
Hi. I was looking for you.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.473
And I was looking for
Liam, so… He's not here.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.558
And I heard some disturbing news

10:42.600 --> 10:45.019
that FSN is putting
performance clauses

10:45.061 --> 10:46.562
into talent deals

10:46.604 --> 10:48.856
which could negatively impact

10:48.898 --> 10:50.858
my deal. Well…

10:50.900 --> 10:54.236
I'm sure that's not true.
Everything has to go through me.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.114
Good, because I agreed
to be in business with you,

10:57.156 --> 10:58.824
not some faceless board,

10:58.866 --> 11:01.952
so I expect you to go to them
and fix this.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.663
Right.

11:03.704 --> 11:06.749
Well, I can't go
do that right now.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.043
Um… Can you give me
a couple weeks?

11:09.085 --> 11:12.463
Unacceptable. They're discussing
this new policy change tomorrow,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.423
and I want it stopped. Do I need

11:14.465 --> 11:17.051
to remind you how valuable I am
to your company?

11:17.093 --> 11:20.429
I get your daily
texts. If it's a problem,

11:20.471 --> 11:23.641
I can take FSN's number one show
to another network.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.309
Okay, let's not be
more dramatic than usual.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.186
I will just find

11:27.228 --> 11:29.778
some way to go to that
board meeting tomorrow, okay?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.984
BETO:
I think we're almost done here.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.237
I just need to test you
on a few last things.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.863
I'm ready for any test you got.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.824
Okay.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.575
Would you like a drink
with dinner, Cristal?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.452
Of course, my love.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.746
I'll have my usual. Whiskey sour

11:45.788 --> 11:47.665
with maple syrup,
not simple syrup.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.001
Perfect.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.421
Tell me, what's our
father's sister's name?

11:53.462 --> 11:55.673
Silvio was an only child, Beto,

11:55.715 --> 11:58.467
but our mother has two siblings,

11:58.509 --> 12:00.052
Tío Javy and Tía Rosa.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.638
How about Cristal's laugh?
It's very specific.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.891
All right. You mean…

12:05.933 --> 12:08.853
(laughing)

12:11.147 --> 12:13.847
Oh, this is gonna work out
even better than I imagined.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.699
Those people at Fallon Unlimited

12:21.741 --> 12:23.451
have some nerve
treating me like this.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.328
I am the face
of their shopping network.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.497
You don't slap the face
that feeds you.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.957
Right.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.834
You should be equally
outraged, Jeff.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.087
As an investor in Dom-Mystique,
this could hurt you, too.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.464
Yeah, absolutely.

12:38.466 --> 12:40.509
You don't seem outraged.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.901
You seem like that lobster
was your best friend.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.890
Okay.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.017
I've been rambling on

12:48.058 --> 12:50.561
about myself this whole time,
I get it.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.146
How are you doing?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.523
Are you at least excited
to be honored for your

12:54.565 --> 12:57.193
charitable work at the
Foundation Gala tomorrow night?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.819
Yeah. Thrilled.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.989
Okay, that's it.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.992
What's going on?
And no more two-word answers.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.079
I've been pursuing
three different tech companies

13:09.121 --> 13:10.289
about a new partnership.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.583
But I can't even get a meeting.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.293
Sweetheart,
maybe they're just busy.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.003
Oh, no, they all got back to me

13:16.045 --> 13:17.505
and said they
weren't interested.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.131
Well, there are other
companies out there.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.591
There could be a million.
It doesn't matter.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.676
After the Colby Co.
Space fiasco,

13:22.718 --> 13:24.470
I'm a liability.
No one will touch me.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.056
Basically, no one
will work with me

13:27.097 --> 13:29.266
until I prove I'm back,
which I can't do

13:29.308 --> 13:31.143
because no one
will work with me.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.114
Well, if it isn't everyone's

13:44.156 --> 13:46.325
least favorite Carrington.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.077
You know you don't
live here, right?

13:48.118 --> 13:49.870
I could have security
just escort you home.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.622
Yeah, I'm looking for Fallon.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.541
She's actually
tied with me for, um,

13:53.582 --> 13:55.000
well, everyone's favorite.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.752
Hmm. I'm not my sister's keeper.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.379
What's this about then?

13:58.420 --> 14:00.464
Some kind of art therapy?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.550
Well, I'm trying to decide

14:02.591 --> 14:05.344
on a logo for
my new company, ACI.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.013
Adam Carrington Industries.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.890
You know, setting up
a new empire is…

14:09.932 --> 14:12.101
well, it's daunting
and exciting, really.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.854
Yeah, this beauty and anti-aging
company is going to be massive.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.605
Is it?

14:16.647 --> 14:18.732
I just have a feeling that soon
the only logo you'll need

14:18.774 --> 14:20.442
is the one for the county jail.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.487
Clever, but I'm not worried
because my alibi is airtight

14:23.529 --> 14:25.698
and your obsession

14:25.739 --> 14:27.783
with me is a little sad.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.664
That looked like fun.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.417
Yeah, he's a treat.
Um, have you seen Fallon?

14:36.458 --> 14:37.960
I just need an extra set

14:38.002 --> 14:40.004
of eyes to help me catch
a Peeping Tom.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.673
Uh, Fallon left,
but I have two eyes

14:42.715 --> 14:44.383
and nothing to do.
(clicks tongue) Count me in.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.803
Um, are you sure? We just,
we barely know each other.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.680
I'm bored, I don't have a job,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.141
and the idea of hunting
for a Peeping Tom sounds

14:52.182 --> 14:54.476
far more thrilling
than rewatching season 21

14:54.518 --> 14:55.769
of Celebrity Intervention.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.605
Wait, the one with Natasha?

14:57.646 --> 15:00.524
Oh, my God, yes. So good.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.942
It's so good.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.988
I see you brought your enforcer
with you this time.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.489
Hello, Mrs. Carrington.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.116
Apparently, your husband
didn't explain to you

15:09.158 --> 15:10.659
that this is not a negotiation.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.870
No, he did, but we're
not here to negotiate.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.998
We're here to tell you
what's about to happen.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.250
We uncovered some details
of a fraternity party

15:18.292 --> 15:20.669
gone horribly wrong
while you were

15:20.711 --> 15:22.504
a senior at Atlanta A&M.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.841
She may not look tough,
but trust me, she's a savage.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.470
(laughs)

15:29.511 --> 15:30.721
I wasn't even living
in the house at this time,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.473
so even if something did happen,

15:32.514 --> 15:35.309
I wasn't involved.
I think we're done here.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.644
No, I don't think we are.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.646
You see, seems that
one of your bros,

15:38.687 --> 15:39.855
who apparently

15:39.897 --> 15:41.190
has a grudge against you,

15:41.231 --> 15:42.691
is willing to testify that you

15:42.733 --> 15:44.068
were in the house.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.403
You're bluffing.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.572
Are you sure you want
to take that chance?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.241
Could be anyone. Maybe Cooper,
down in Tallahassee?

15:51.283 --> 15:54.203
Right. You remember,
The Grateful Coop?

15:54.244 --> 15:55.955
Or Jefferson, in
Dallas? J-Money.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.958
Did your fraternity have a rule
about horrible nicknames?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.793
(clears throat)
CRISTAL: And those

16:00.834 --> 16:02.878
are just the ones in the photo.
There were a lot of people

16:02.920 --> 16:06.131
in that house. We're
not bluffing, Lippy.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.133
So, in addition to what
we already agreed upon,

16:08.175 --> 16:11.428
we're gonna need, you know,
a little bit more.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.222
Guaranteed government contracts

16:13.263 --> 16:15.265
for Flores Incorporado. I
don't even know what that is.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.226
That's all right,
we'll fill you in.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.270
I'll have to talk
to the governor.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.356
You have 24 hours.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.818
Have a good day.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.865
Mmm. Amazing.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.200
Thank you.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.244
Just the husband
I've been looking for.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.121
Hopefully the only one.
What's with the basket?

16:37.162 --> 16:39.331
I was thinking it would be good

16:39.373 --> 16:41.083
for us to do something fun
together tomorrow.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.211
You know, like we used to before
the drama train rolled in.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.046
Unless, of course,

16:46.088 --> 16:49.883
you're busy or not in the mood
for fun with me.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.011
I'm totally in the mood.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.472
Wait, you thinking
outdoor adventure,

16:55.514 --> 16:57.391
like rock climbing?
'Cause I'm so down for that.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.309
No, I told you we're never
doing that again,

16:59.351 --> 17:00.936
but…

17:00.978 --> 17:03.578
if you're down for an adventure,
I've got it covered.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.525
KIRBY: Nice moon.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.778
No drone. I'm bored. Well…

17:09.820 --> 17:13.532
security says it usually
flies by at 7:00, so…

17:13.574 --> 17:16.118
I'll watch the east, you
watch the west? Gotcha.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.537
Other west.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.164
Gotcha.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.087
What if it doesn't show up?

17:27.129 --> 17:28.672
It will.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.632
Security says the perv
shows up rain or shine.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.844
(sighs) We could be here
all night.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.096
What are you doing?

17:36.138 --> 17:38.265
You crazy?
That's never gonna work.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.059
If you want to catch
a Peeping Tom,

17:40.100 --> 17:41.727
you have to give them
something to peep at.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.937
(drone whirring)

17:43.979 --> 17:45.189
Drone!

17:45.230 --> 17:47.316
(whirring continues)

17:52.154 --> 17:54.615
Okay, so it's landed on the…

17:54.656 --> 17:58.327
ninth floor balcony. Perfect.
I'm gonna go over there.

17:58.368 --> 18:01.038
Hey, um, thanks for helping.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.165
This was fun, but maybe

18:03.207 --> 18:05.584
get some mace before you go
see the creepy guy.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.544
Yeah.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.841
What is happening?
You are knocking

18:12.883 --> 18:14.718
way too loud, unless
the building is on fire.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.845
That's the least of your
problems, you sicko.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.305
(chuckles)
I'm sorry, do I know you?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.557
No, but only because
I haven't undressed

18:20.599 --> 18:22.142
in the building
across the street.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.937
So, you're talking about
undressing, and I'm the sicko?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.480
I think you should probably
leave, since I have no idea

18:26.522 --> 18:28.440
what you're talking
about. (Chuckles) No.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.110
I am talking about your drone,
you pervert.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.153
I caught it in the act.
You have been spying

18:33.195 --> 18:35.197
on women for the last two weeks
with that thing.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.657
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but that wasn't me.

18:36.698 --> 18:37.866
Oh, really?

18:37.908 --> 18:39.535
Well, can you tell me why

18:39.576 --> 18:42.076
I saw the drone come back
and land on your balcony?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.540
Sadly, I can.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.751
Oh, you can? I think I know

18:47.793 --> 18:49.962
who the pervert is,
as you so charmingly

18:50.003 --> 18:51.338
put it.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.132
My nephew Timmy
has been staying with me

18:53.173 --> 18:55.342
for a few weeks,
and I had no idea

18:55.384 --> 18:57.511
what the kid was doing
out there. He's ten,

18:57.553 --> 19:00.305
or 14. I don't ask
a lot of questions.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.099
Well, I'm sure the police

19:02.141 --> 19:04.560
will have some questions
for your so-called "nephew."

19:04.601 --> 19:06.311
No, no, no, please
do not call the police.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.063
My sister already thinks
I'm the worst uncle.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.774
Look, I promise I will
make him stop and delete

19:10.816 --> 19:13.277
all of the video. No! Um, no.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.029
One of his videos…

19:16.864 --> 19:19.964
It could be the only thing that
exonerates my mother of murder.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.828
Wow, a murder? Really?

19:22.870 --> 19:25.956
Look, it's a long shot,
but I'm-I'm praying

19:25.998 --> 19:28.792
that he was flying his drone
the night of the crime.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.254
Well, only one way to find out.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.299
Hey, Timmy!

19:35.340 --> 19:38.635
Get your ten-to-14-year-old
butt out here.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.688
What am I watching?

19:49.730 --> 19:50.981
Your demise?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.694
Is that…

19:56.987 --> 19:58.280
Where did you get this?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.200
Unfortunately,
the drone only got

20:01.241 --> 20:02.743
those few moments
before it flew off.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.370
What's this supposed to prove?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.705
There isn't even any sound.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.040
It proves that you were there,

20:08.081 --> 20:09.833
not Alexis, so when
the district attorney

20:09.875 --> 20:12.669
sees it, our mother
will look way less guilty,

20:12.711 --> 20:14.811
and you will look, well,
completely guilty.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.634
Okay. The truth is, um…

20:18.675 --> 20:20.677
Bobby's death

20:20.719 --> 20:22.221
was, uh, it was an accident.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.722
He-he charged me,

20:23.764 --> 20:25.307
and-and when I moved
out of the way,

20:25.349 --> 20:27.226
he slipped, and he just…

20:27.267 --> 20:30.187
(blows air, pops lips)

20:30.229 --> 20:31.813
Which you would've seen
if the drone hadn't have left.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.982
Well, I'm sure the police

20:34.024 --> 20:35.984
will take your word for it,
with your history

20:36.026 --> 20:37.527
of honesty and good deeds.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.987
Listen, Hagatha Christie,

20:39.029 --> 20:40.948
that's why I didn't tell them.
(stammers)

20:40.989 --> 20:42.908
I never actually thought
they would convict Alexis

20:42.950 --> 20:44.284
on circumstantial evidence.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.994
Oh, right, yeah, I'm sure.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.038
Children, please don't fight
in front of your mother

20:48.080 --> 20:50.123
while she is in lockup.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.917
Adam, I have a plan. Amanda,

20:51.959 --> 20:53.710
would you give us
a moment, please?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.254
I know you don't
agree with this,

20:55.295 --> 20:57.130
but it's what is right
for everyone.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.265
What-What's this?
A contract. It's simple.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.474
You sign over the rights

21:07.516 --> 21:09.601
to your anti-aging drug to me,

21:09.643 --> 21:11.311
or I show the video to the D.A.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.272
That-that makes no sense.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.107
What-what good will a patent be

21:15.148 --> 21:16.775
if you're stuck in
jail? Like you said,

21:16.817 --> 21:19.403
they won't convict me
on circumstantial evidence.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.072
So, now the question is whether
you'll be taking my spot here.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.909
Mother, I really need
this patent for ACI.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.329
Adam Carrington
Industries. Don't worry.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.456
You'll retain
a small percentage.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.876
I am not Dr. Larson-level
greedy. Plus,

21:34.918 --> 21:36.837
I don't want you to push me
over a balcony.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.589
I told you it was
an accident. Bu…

21:39.631 --> 21:42.676
There…

21:42.718 --> 21:45.178
there has to be some
other way. I've…

21:45.220 --> 21:47.097
I've worked way too hard
for this.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.142
Well, if you think of one while
you're lying on your metal bed

21:50.183 --> 21:52.477
in your cell, let me know.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.772
Though, the phone
does get quite crowded,

21:55.814 --> 21:58.108
so get there early.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.281
Cristal.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.907
Beto? What are you doing here?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.409
You're not supposed
to be in Atlanta.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.119
And yet, here I am.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.954
Why? You'll find
out soon enough.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.248
I don't have time
for you and your drama.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.625
I'm hosting a big gala
at the ma…

22:22.132 --> 22:23.925
LIAM: Fallon is honoring
her medical leave,

22:23.967 --> 22:27.304
but it is within her legal right
to appoint me as her proxy.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.599
So, let's get down to business.
I am ready, willing and able.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.976
Will you give us a moment
to discuss this, Liam?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.603
Sure, but keep it to a moment.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.735
Have I mentioned I think
this is a monumentally bad idea

22:41.777 --> 22:43.904
and not remotely what I pictured
for our adventure?

22:43.945 --> 22:45.155
Yes, yes, I know,

22:45.197 --> 22:46.573
but I need you to stop them

22:46.615 --> 22:48.492
from making a huge mistake.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.911
So, just say what I say.
Come on, it'll be fun for us.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.162
We never do stuff
like this anymore.

22:52.204 --> 22:55.457
Liam, we'll allow
your proxy vote.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.918
Great. Well, the first order

22:57.959 --> 23:00.253
of business today is the new
FSN talent deals.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.421
FALLON: Fabulous.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.547
Fabulous.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.091
Tell them that the proposed

23:04.132 --> 23:05.550
performance clauses
in the new talent deals

23:05.592 --> 23:07.469
may seem fine on paper,

23:07.511 --> 23:09.262
but they will backfire
spectacularly

23:09.304 --> 23:11.973
when they cause
our top designers to walk.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.353
You know what's not fabulous?

23:16.395 --> 23:19.815
The proposed performance
clauses in the talent deals,

23:19.856 --> 23:21.650
which will backfire
spectacularly

23:21.691 --> 23:23.318
when they cause
our top designers to walk.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.903
Good. I mean, you know,

23:24.945 --> 23:26.947
you left the part out
about the paper, but

23:26.988 --> 23:28.490
you're improv-ing,
which is fun. See?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.866
We're good at this.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.118
ELLEN: No, but won't
performance clauses

23:31.159 --> 23:32.786
incentivize our top designers?

23:34.579 --> 23:36.331
Great question, Ellen.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.793
One that will take
a minute or two to answer.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.005
They're artists first,
and we can't afford to risk that

23:44.047 --> 23:45.966
perceived
organizational distrust

23:46.007 --> 23:48.969
will cause them to sacrifice
creativity over quality.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.847
They're artists first.

23:51.888 --> 23:55.100
And we can't afford for
our organization not to

23:55.142 --> 23:57.477
trust them or their creativity.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.396
Okay, I said improv,
not rewrite.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.065
Hmm. You make a good point.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.108
Thank you, Ellen.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.193
(faint squeaking)

24:08.155 --> 24:11.158
(rat chittering)

24:11.199 --> 24:12.909
There's a rat.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.744
There's a rat. There's a rat.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.831
And furthermore,
there's a rat. ELLEN: In…

24:17.873 --> 24:20.125
In the company? Like the Mafia?

24:20.167 --> 24:21.626
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.962
There's-there's,
like, a real rat in the vent.

24:24.004 --> 24:27.132
(gasps, whimpers)

24:27.174 --> 24:29.134
No.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.261
I mean there's a rat

24:31.303 --> 24:33.388
in all of us

24:33.430 --> 24:34.890
just…

24:34.931 --> 24:38.351
scurrying to get
to the organizational cheese.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.604
Seriously? (Gasps)

24:42.022 --> 24:45.275
(others exclaiming)
(Fallon groans)

24:45.317 --> 24:46.776
Oh, my…

24:46.818 --> 24:48.778
Fallon?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.238
(Fallon grunts)

24:50.280 --> 24:51.990
LIAM: Are you okay?
I'm fine. Good news.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.533
I was able

24:53.575 --> 24:56.161
to locate the source
of the rodent problem,

24:56.203 --> 24:57.913
and you guys are all good.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.665
So carry on,
and I'll be on my way.

25:00.707 --> 25:03.335
You have left me no choice.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.837
I will now personally submit
a motion to the board

25:05.879 --> 25:07.589
to permanently remove you
as CEO.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.924
FALLON: Yeah.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.675
I figured.

25:10.717 --> 25:13.367
But Liam can still vote for
me at that meeting, right?

25:14.596 --> 25:16.056
(screams)

25:16.097 --> 25:18.266
Sorry, I thought it was the rat.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.270
(Cristal grunting softly)

25:24.814 --> 25:26.066
What the hell is going on here,

25:26.107 --> 25:27.776
Beto? Where are we?

25:27.817 --> 25:29.778
Untie me right now.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.404
¿Estás loco?

25:31.446 --> 25:33.323
Okay, cálmate, hermana.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.659
I mean, you can scream all you
want. No one's gonna hear you

25:35.700 --> 25:36.785
where we are.

25:36.826 --> 25:39.287
(grunting)

25:39.329 --> 25:40.705
Is this about money?

25:40.747 --> 25:43.667
Untie me,
and I'll write you a check.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.003
I'll untie you when you behave.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.630
I don't want a check.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.632
I want our family company,
which you stole from me.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.758
Haven't we been over this?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.218
It's not gonna happen.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.470
But I'm expected at the gala,
and the second

25:55.512 --> 25:58.348
Blake knows I'm missing,
he'll look for me. Don't worry.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.268
You are already at the gala.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.980
(indistinct chatter)

26:08.024 --> 26:09.568
(Blake laughs)

26:09.609 --> 26:12.445
Excuse me. Great news.

26:12.487 --> 26:14.072
The governor signed off

26:14.114 --> 26:16.199
on our deal. We got
everything we wanted. He had

26:16.241 --> 26:18.076
no idea we were bluffing.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.953
How did you know?

26:19.995 --> 26:22.914
Well, I'm pretty good
at reading people.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.417
As a physical therapist. Mm.

26:26.459 --> 26:29.659
I've never been more thrilled to
have you as my wife and partner.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.465
Wait a minute.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.970
Where's your wedding ring?

26:37.929 --> 26:40.557
Oh. I must have left it

26:40.599 --> 26:42.100
at the salon
when I got my manicure.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.227
I'll call them and
have them hold it

26:44.269 --> 26:46.438
for me until the morning. Okay.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.731
These things happen.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.274
Now let's go

26:49.316 --> 26:51.443
show everyone
who means anything in Atlanta

26:51.484 --> 26:53.445
how stunning you are.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.208
Wow. You definitely stuck
this landing

27:07.250 --> 27:09.210
a whole lot better than the
one at the board meeting.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.630
I may still have a piece
of plaster lodged in my ear,

27:11.671 --> 27:13.882
but thank you. So, you're
not mad? (Chuckles)

27:13.923 --> 27:16.593
No. No, I feel bad
about how it turned out.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.262
I got to admit, that was
kind of wild, though.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.764
It's given me a couple ideas

27:20.805 --> 27:22.140
of other things that
we can do together.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.642
Oh, such as?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.352
Oh, I don't know.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.189
Have you ever had sex
in a closet at a gala?

27:29.230 --> 27:31.566
Ooh, it's like
a pornographic game of Clue.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.234
But sadly,

27:33.276 --> 27:35.278
as much as I've missed
tearing your clothes off

27:35.320 --> 27:36.696
and you tearing mine,

27:36.738 --> 27:37.781
I have to keep them on
a little longer

27:37.822 --> 27:39.282
because I invited Ellen

27:39.324 --> 27:41.076
and the board,
and they're here somewhere.

27:41.117 --> 27:43.286
That's surprisingly mature
of you. That's what I want

27:43.328 --> 27:44.788
them to think. I need them here

27:44.829 --> 27:46.831
when the 200 shareholders
waiting outside storm in

27:46.873 --> 27:48.750
to vote them out,
which, before you ask,

27:48.792 --> 27:49.751
is perfectly legal.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.294
Legal? Sure.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.130
Ethical? Eh. Maybe.
I just have to find

27:54.172 --> 27:56.716
Jeff to tell him that my speech
praising his charitable work

27:56.758 --> 27:58.051
now includes a hostile takeover

27:58.093 --> 27:59.844
of my own company.
I'll give Betty

27:59.886 --> 28:01.554
the signal.
She'll bring in the horde.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.223
Everything
will be back to normal.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.684
Got it. Hostile takeover first.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.477
Clothes ripping second.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.521
Perfect.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.068
ADAM: Do you think
people actually just want

28:15.110 --> 28:17.028
the mint jelly? This is
completely unprofessional.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.573
Go get some
lamb. Hello, darling.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.243
Mother, what are you
doing here? Did…

28:23.284 --> 28:24.786
Did you escape? Wait,

28:24.828 --> 28:26.454
you-you know that this is
probably the second place

28:26.496 --> 28:27.789
the police
are gonna look for you,

28:27.831 --> 28:29.249
right? Why are you
being so paranoid?

28:29.290 --> 28:30.667
You're acting like my cellmate.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.168
I didn't escape anything.
I was released

28:32.210 --> 28:33.545
when I showed the entire video

28:33.586 --> 28:35.964
to the D.A. Wait, entire video?

28:36.005 --> 28:37.841
Excuse me.
I have been doing hard time,

28:37.882 --> 28:39.467
and now I need hard liquor. Uh,

28:39.509 --> 28:40.510
no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.803
You are not going anywhere

28:41.845 --> 28:44.222
until you give me some answers.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.933
You can be quite exhausting,
you know that?

28:46.975 --> 28:48.727
(clears throat)

28:48.768 --> 28:51.271
You might want to grab
some popcorn.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.987
See? It was an accident.

28:59.946 --> 29:03.742
(breathes deeply)

29:03.783 --> 29:06.453
You had that the whole time.
And you tricked me

29:06.494 --> 29:08.580
into signing over the rights
to my patent to you.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.708
Yes. It's almost as bad
as letting me rot in jail

29:11.750 --> 29:13.001
for a crime I didn't commit.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.753
Apples and oranges, really.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.963
Anyway,
the D.A. ruled it an accident,

29:17.005 --> 29:19.048
and after
a not insignificant donation

29:19.090 --> 29:20.550
to the Policeman's Fund,

29:20.592 --> 29:22.260
no charges
will be brought against you

29:22.302 --> 29:24.429
for lying to the police.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.681
All's well that ends well, then.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.309
We should celebrate, right?

29:29.350 --> 29:31.186
I will.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.897
And I expect to see you bright
and early at the penthouse

29:33.938 --> 29:34.898
to get started

29:34.939 --> 29:37.025
on our company. Oh,

29:37.066 --> 29:39.319
and I've thought about
it. The name ACI?

29:39.360 --> 29:40.320
It's out.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.322
What? But I have logos.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.323
We'll make new ones.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.783
The company is now called

29:44.824 --> 29:46.075
ALEXAM.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.786
Hate it.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.580
Mother?

29:50.622 --> 29:52.791
What are you doing here?

29:52.832 --> 29:54.959
Did you escape? Did you get your
hair done after you broke out?

29:55.001 --> 29:57.128
I'm free. And I am so happy

29:57.170 --> 30:00.173
to see you up, healthy
and looking gorgeous.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.841
I'm so sorry

30:01.883 --> 30:03.218
I didn't visit you
at the hospital,

30:03.259 --> 30:05.220
but I was, you know,
in the slammer.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.554
And I'm sorry
I didn't visit you in prison,

30:06.596 --> 30:08.389
but I was, you know, in a coma.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.141
Should you be running around?
How are you feeling? Oh,

30:10.183 --> 30:12.393
I feel fine. I would love
to talk, and we will later,

30:12.435 --> 30:15.897
but I have a work crisis
that needs my focus.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.358
Mm.

30:18.399 --> 30:19.984
It's like I never left.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.070
Oh, champagne boy. Yes.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.823
KIRBY: I can't believe he found

30:24.864 --> 30:27.116
a flaw with Gigi,
Rachel wasn't his type,

30:27.158 --> 30:29.452
and he just wasn't
feeling Molly.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.496
At least this Nina woman
seems like a contender.

30:31.538 --> 30:34.165
I love her. She stayed
at the hotel a few times.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.625
Gorgeous, successful.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.628
My legit top candidate.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.338
Was there a movie
you fell in love with

30:40.380 --> 30:42.882
as a kid that planted the seeds
of your career path?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.467
That's a very
insightful question.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.303
I thought so. Well,
you may think it's weird,

30:47.345 --> 30:49.848
but probably
Silence of the Lambs.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.683
The first time I
finished watching it,

30:51.724 --> 30:53.977
I knew I either wanted to be
an FBI agent

30:54.018 --> 30:56.396
or a film director.
Silence of the Lambs?

30:56.437 --> 31:00.066
(chuckles) No, no, no, no,
no. Scary movies, not my thing.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.901
What if I promise
to hold your hand?

31:01.943 --> 31:04.529
Well, that might get me

31:04.571 --> 31:05.697
to reconsider.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.449
(chuckles softly)

31:11.995 --> 31:13.204
Mm. Are you okay?

31:13.246 --> 31:15.290
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm good.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.419
Okay, could you

31:19.460 --> 31:22.297
not lick your fingers, please?

31:22.338 --> 31:24.007
It's unsanitary. For who?

31:24.048 --> 31:25.884
My fingers, my mouth, right?

31:25.925 --> 31:27.635
(chuckles)
Yeah, you're not helping.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.429
And you're acting like a child.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.598
I'm not the one
licking my fingers.

31:31.639 --> 31:33.099
Wow. Thank you

31:33.141 --> 31:34.100
for making this so easy.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.311
I think we're done here.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.271
You dropped your napkin.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.480
Oh, that's right.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.566
You don't use those. (Gasps)

31:42.775 --> 31:44.193
What the hell just happened?

31:44.235 --> 31:45.862
Nothing happened.
You want to help me?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.530
Stay out of my love life.

31:47.572 --> 31:48.865
(scoffs)

31:50.408 --> 31:52.368
This makes no sense.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.370
I mean, I don't even date women,

31:54.412 --> 31:55.622
and I'd consider
sleeping with Nina.

31:55.663 --> 31:56.664
I have dated women,

31:56.706 --> 31:58.958
and she's an absolute babe.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.378
AMANDA:
Well, it's nice to see you

32:02.420 --> 32:04.339
near a bar
instead of behind them.

32:04.380 --> 32:07.216
Thanks to you. You did
one of the most wonderful things

32:07.258 --> 32:09.510
anyone has ever done for me.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.095
You saved me.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.097
Oh. Mother,

32:13.139 --> 32:15.433
I wanted to introduce you to
Dex Dexter. This is the man

32:15.475 --> 32:16.851
who truly saved you.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.144
Alexis is your mother?

32:18.186 --> 32:20.146
Farnsworth Dexter.
(Dex chuckles)

32:20.188 --> 32:21.940
Wow. I haven't been called

32:21.981 --> 32:23.399
Farnsworth since college.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.818
Sorry, what's happening here?

32:25.860 --> 32:28.613
Farnsworth… Dex…

32:28.655 --> 32:30.907
Is the son of Sam Dexter,

32:30.949 --> 32:32.575
who sat on the board at C.A.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.619
Our families have been friends
for years.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.622
I haven't seen you in years.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.832
I-I haven't forgotten you.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.668
I think

32:41.709 --> 32:43.503
you and I should have a cocktail
and catch up

32:43.544 --> 32:44.963
so I can properly thank you

32:45.004 --> 32:47.006
for being my hero.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.426
(chuckles)

32:50.468 --> 32:52.428
So do tell me what
you've been up to.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.972
ADAM: Hey.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.348
Oh, geez! I lost
control of my company

32:55.390 --> 32:56.432
because of you. (Clears throat)

32:56.474 --> 32:58.184
So I'm not gonna forget that.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.019
Well, because of me, you're not
in prison, and neither

33:00.061 --> 33:01.646
is our mother, so maybe
you don't forget that.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.398
Yeah, I wouldn't
hold your breath

33:03.439 --> 33:04.524
waiting for my gratitude
for that.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.943
Okay. And once I get control

33:06.985 --> 33:09.153
of ACI again,
I'll deal with you.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.905
There's only room

33:10.947 --> 33:13.324
for one troublemaker
in this family.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.618
That position's filled.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.956
DOMINIQUE: If you're
looking for Jeff, he's not here.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.582
He won't be attending.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.502
What? Why not? Is he
okay? Physically, yes.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.045
But emotionally, he's a wreck

33:26.087 --> 33:28.506
because every business
opportunity has vanished.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.091
No one wants to work
with him anymore.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.676
That can't be true.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.345
He can't even get a meeting,
and unfortunately,

33:34.387 --> 33:37.432
his identity is completely
wrapped up in his career.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.600
He doesn't realize
there's more to life

33:39.642 --> 33:41.394
than being in the game.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.690
Not that you're like that.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.567
You have a…

33:47.608 --> 33:49.277
rich life outside of work.

33:49.318 --> 33:50.945
I need some champagne.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.739
Stat.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.575
ELLEN: The board and
I are leaving now. Oh.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.993
We only came for the optics.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.495
We're meeting in the morning.
I have the votes

33:59.537 --> 34:04.000
to remove you as CEO. I'm sorry.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.170
Uh, Ellen, wait.

34:07.211 --> 34:11.049
The board does not
have to meet tomorrow because

34:11.090 --> 34:15.261
I am withdrawing my appeal,

34:15.303 --> 34:19.432
and stepping down as CEO,
temporarily.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.476
This company matters more
than any of us.

34:21.517 --> 34:24.645
Well, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

34:24.687 --> 34:25.897
We'll still meet in the morning

34:25.938 --> 34:27.523
to formally accept
your resignation

34:27.565 --> 34:30.026
and choose a new CEO.
Will I have any say in that?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.486
Not after you've stepped down.

34:31.527 --> 34:34.238
Oh, well, I'm still
CEO tonight, right?

34:34.280 --> 34:37.033
So excuse me. Dominique,

34:37.075 --> 34:38.910
call Jeff and tell him
I'll meet him

34:38.951 --> 34:40.828
at the Elevation Lounge
in 20 minutes.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.789
It's important.
And, Liam… On it.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.124
You and I are having sex in
an hour, so you have 55 minutes

34:45.166 --> 34:47.168
to get upstairs,
do some push-ups,

34:47.210 --> 34:49.670
and take your
clothes off. Way on it.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.929
Look, I'm sorry I snapped
at you. You're forgiven.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.972
But there's one more woman
you have to meet who

35:00.014 --> 35:01.891
we know will be a game changer.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.810
And I won't take no
for an answer.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.981
Mama, what are you…

35:09.023 --> 35:10.983
You dragged her out
of the house for this?

35:11.025 --> 35:12.902
LUELLA:
They didn't drag me anywhere.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.738
They called and told me you were
ready to settle down,

35:15.780 --> 35:17.573
and I couldn't get here
fast enough.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.743
Well, that's the plan.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.411
I just gotta find
the right person first.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.830
That's all well and good,

35:23.871 --> 35:25.498
but I also hear that

35:25.540 --> 35:28.084
you've been rejecting women
right and left.

35:29.293 --> 35:32.255
Who do you think you are,
Billy Dee Williams?

35:32.296 --> 35:34.090
Yes, he does. But pre-Lando.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.050
Shut it.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.594
I just want what
you and Dad had.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.513
Is that too much to ask?

35:40.555 --> 35:43.516
No. But you should know that

35:43.558 --> 35:45.852
my marriage to your father
was far from perfect.

35:45.893 --> 35:49.105
He did some things that
drove me crazy.

35:49.147 --> 35:53.734
And I suppose I did some things
that drove him crazy.

35:53.776 --> 35:56.445
Though his were
crazier. (Both laugh)

35:56.487 --> 35:58.197
I love her. Yeah.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.366
But the point is, if I'd had

36:00.408 --> 36:02.201
a list of requirements,

36:02.243 --> 36:05.705
I never would have
married your father.

36:05.746 --> 36:08.666
Which turned out to be the best
decision I ever made.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.835
You get what I'm saying, son?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.546
I get you.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.633
And I love you. Good.

36:17.675 --> 36:18.801
I love you, too.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.803
Now, how about buying your mama

36:20.845 --> 36:22.847
a fancy drink,
and maybe a Porterhouse?

36:30.479 --> 36:32.398
She does make a lot of sense.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.442
Yeah, she does.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.319
And, if you're still
willing to help,

36:36.360 --> 36:38.446
I promise to be less picky.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.573
Great. So I'll call Nina.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.825
Mm-mm-mm.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.702
Literally, anyone but Nina.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.112
What's the problem with Nina?

36:50.458 --> 36:53.002
You know what my favorite part
of the gala is?

36:53.044 --> 36:54.795
When it's over,
and you and I can

36:54.837 --> 36:57.173
go upstairs to celebrate.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.966
Unless you want to
slip back into the study.

36:59.008 --> 37:02.720
Blake Carrington, you're the
most charming man on the planet.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.805
And I'd go anywhere with you.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.182
But I'm not feeling so great.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.435
So I'm gonna make myself
a cup of tea.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.687
But can I get a rain check
on that anywhere celebration?

37:11.729 --> 37:13.397
Yeah, of course you can.
It's been a long day.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.691
Wake me up when
you crawl into bed.

37:24.659 --> 37:25.910
So what's the big emergency?

37:25.952 --> 37:27.370
I was in my pajamas.

37:27.411 --> 37:31.374
I'm stepping down
as CEO as of tomorrow because

37:31.415 --> 37:34.293
I have some personal things
that I need to figure out.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.129
And also, they banned me
from the building.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.590
Uh, wow.
Didn't expect to hear that.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.342
Well, it's temporary, but,

37:41.384 --> 37:43.094
I heard some of the stuff
going on in your life,

37:43.135 --> 37:45.805
and I can relate to wanting
to get back in the game.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.557
Okay, now, hold up.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.017
Uh, I see where this is headed,

37:50.059 --> 37:52.186
and I'm not interested, okay?

37:52.228 --> 37:54.021
I said I didn't want
to be on your board,

37:54.063 --> 37:56.274
and I certainly don't want to
be your charity hire. Oh, no.

37:56.315 --> 37:59.110
This is not that. My biological
corporate clock is ticking.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.320
I have 24 hours to
pick a new CEO,

38:01.362 --> 38:04.031
or they're gonna
pick one for me.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.450
Listen, I'm really not
in a good place right now,

38:06.492 --> 38:08.077
and I have my own
soul searching to do.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.495
Well, you can soul search
while you work.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.372
I need somebody who I can trust

38:11.414 --> 38:13.249
to protect my baby.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.085
Somebody smart, somebody bold.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.170
Somebody who's as crazy as I am.

38:18.212 --> 38:21.007
Somebody who's family.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.217
And I'm really hoping
that person is you.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.846
This is the most insane thing
I've ever heard.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.806
You think Blake won't notice
the difference between us?

38:28.848 --> 38:30.683
He'll immediately know
it's not me.

38:30.725 --> 38:34.270
Honey, I'm home.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.567
Oh, my God.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.698
Oh, my God.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.158
Told you.

38:47.199 --> 38:48.242
How'd it go?

38:48.284 --> 38:50.161
Better than I expected.

38:50.202 --> 38:52.121
Apparently your Flores company
is even more valuable

38:52.163 --> 38:54.040
because Blake and I made a deal
with the governor.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.833
Blake and I made a deal,
you psycho.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.669
RITA: Can't stay long.

38:58.711 --> 39:02.048
Blake is eagerly waiting
for me to return

39:02.089 --> 39:05.885
so we can celebrate.
That should be fun.

39:05.926 --> 39:08.554
I don't know who you are,
but I am begging you,

39:08.596 --> 39:10.306
woman to woman,

39:10.348 --> 39:13.434
let me go home, please.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.493
I hope your rings fit.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.329
I think my hands are just
a little more feminine.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.831
Now, if you'll
excuse me, (grunts)

39:35.873 --> 39:39.126
I have a date in your bedroom.

39:49.470 --> 39:53.140
So Jeff accepted my offer,

39:53.182 --> 39:56.268
and Ellen accepted my assurance
that Jeff was

39:56.310 --> 39:58.479
the ideal candidate
to replace me.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.065
Jeff will be approved as CEO
until I am fully ready

40:01.107 --> 40:02.358
and cleared to return.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.652
Wow. That's a big deal.

40:04.693 --> 40:07.947
Well, yeah. I mean,
I almost died, Liam. Twice.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.574
I know. That's a bigger deal.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.827
And I'm glad you're
realizing that.

40:12.868 --> 40:18.040
Which is why I have decided

40:18.082 --> 40:19.625
to take some time away

40:19.667 --> 40:24.130
to figure out who I am
away from Fallon Unlimited.

40:24.171 --> 40:28.426
And reconnect with you
on every level.

40:28.467 --> 40:31.804
I mean, I know that
the board meeting was a bit

40:31.846 --> 40:34.849
of a fiasco, but it kind of
felt like us again, right?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.477
This is gonna sound ridiculous,

40:38.519 --> 40:41.981
but seeing you drop out
of the ceiling

40:42.022 --> 40:43.607
to escape a rodent

40:43.649 --> 40:48.237
made me realize how much
I've missed having fun with you.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.948
I like this version of Fallon,

40:50.990 --> 40:54.618
and I can't wait to see
much more of her, starting now.

41:01.834 --> 41:05.838
Mm. I like it when you talk
about me in the third person.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.175
Maybe you should undress
Fallon now.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.968
Ooh, this is fun.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.761
It's kind of like we're having
a threesome.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.221
(laughs)

41:16.807 --> 41:19.185
(door opens) BLAKE:
I am not happy.

41:19.226 --> 41:21.937
Yeah. You can imagine
how Fallon feels.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.856
I had to jump in and give
a last-minute speech

41:23.898 --> 41:25.483
at the gala
when you disappeared.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.624
Those usually take
days to prepare. Blake.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.282
Oh.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.451
Apparently the awkwardness
between the two of you is gone.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.619
You're welcome.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.496
Yeah, you really saved the day.

41:38.537 --> 41:39.997
LIAM: You told your father
it was awkward between us?

41:40.039 --> 41:42.208
I mean, not as awkward
as it is now.

41:42.249 --> 41:44.210
Please get out.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.794
Happily.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.881
But if you need any
more… BOTH: Get out!
