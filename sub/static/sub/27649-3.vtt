00:28.166 --> 00:30.391
Put your arms out in front of you.

00:30.416 --> 00:33.031
Now show me your chains, your shackles.

00:34.261 --> 00:36.236
Do you see them?
No.

00:36.261 --> 00:38.267
Well, rattle them, rattle them.
Can you hear them?

00:39.651 --> 00:41.079
Where are they?

00:42.699 --> 00:46.704
Your chains are forged by the
preconceptions of others

00:46.729 --> 00:51.190
and your misconceptions of yourself.
Of what you can do.

00:51.215 --> 00:53.269
Of how high you can fly.

00:53.294 --> 00:54.783
Of who you are.

00:56.058 --> 00:59.705
Your chains are in your minds
and in your hearts.

01:01.527 --> 01:04.221
They are your fears and your temptations,

01:04.247 --> 01:06.988
but you must not succumb
to them because you are...

01:08.402 --> 01:10.752
...the stuff that dreams are made of.

01:10.777 --> 01:12.159
The stuff of dreams!

01:13.575 --> 01:16.675
You are the things I did not do.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.002
You are the things I will not do.

01:20.027 --> 01:23.752
You are the things I could not do.

01:26.263 --> 01:28.863
You are the children, the grandchildren

01:28.888 --> 01:34.097
of men and women who've made
enormous sacrifices,

01:34.888 --> 01:37.753
but you will honour those sacrifices

01:37.778 --> 01:40.831
by living lives they could only dream of.

01:44.372 --> 01:48.706
You will not let yourselves down,
because if you do, you let me down.

01:49.809 --> 01:52.191
And you don't want to let me down.

01:52.216 --> 01:54.316
No, sir.

01:54.341 --> 01:56.753
I have high hopes for you,

01:56.778 --> 01:59.034
and I try not to worry,

01:59.059 --> 02:01.753
because as my nan would say...

02:01.778 --> 02:05.801
"All crab find their hole..."

02:07.341 --> 02:08.473
"..all bread find his cheese,

02:08.497 --> 02:12.034
"and remember, you have guts like calabash."

02:27.342 --> 02:29.989
it's going to a club in Vauxhall.
The Echo, yeah?

02:30.014 --> 02:32.034
Ask for Dominica.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.473
Take your helmet off.

02:44.342 --> 02:47.271
When I ask you to achieve,

02:47.296 --> 02:48.910
to gain skills,

02:48.935 --> 02:51.708
to read, do maths, to think,

02:51.733 --> 02:55.755
I'm not asking for me or just for you.

02:57.094 --> 03:01.069
I am asking for your parents.
Your grandparents.

03:01.094 --> 03:02.991
Your great-grandparents.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.911
I am asking for all that has gone before

03:06.936 --> 03:09.583
and all that will come after.

03:13.126 --> 03:16.616
I'm asking for the future you.

03:17.829 --> 03:21.429
I'm asking for the person
you can become.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.107
Skiving?

04:31.132 --> 04:32.825
That's what I do.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.467
I didn't want it to look
like you were late.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.639
I'm not late.
I'm not skiving.

04:38.897 --> 04:40.544
Terrorist?

04:40.569 --> 04:42.264
Nothing definitive.

04:42.289 --> 04:44.029
So what's the cause of the explosion?

04:44.054 --> 04:45.264
The expo thinks chemical.

04:48.647 --> 04:50.872
All cleared inside, sir.
Thank you.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.233
I was walking here on
the pavement,

05:00.258 --> 05:05.061
and there was an explosion
here, and... like that.

05:05.086 --> 05:06.950
Where were you going?

05:06.975 --> 05:08.467
Home.

05:08.492 --> 05:10.639
Did you get his home address?

05:10.664 --> 05:11.997
G

05:13.289 --> 05:15.669
Where were you coming from?

05:15.694 --> 05:17.233
A shop.

05:17.258 --> 05:18.858
I was asking the gentleman.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.359
Shop.

05:21.976 --> 05:22.952
Is this yours?

05:24.898 --> 05:26.234
No.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.952
I've asked him. it's evidence.
Who do you think it belongs to?

05:39.135 --> 05:40.797
Smells like cat urine.

05:53.244 --> 05:56.625
One body. Badly burnt.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.907
Jack
Seat of the blast was here.

05:59.932 --> 06:01.547
Propane.

06:01.572 --> 06:02.985
Butane.

06:03.010 --> 06:05.672
Caught fire,

06:05.697 --> 06:09.078
but melted the plastic mains pipe.

06:09.103 --> 06:11.750
Water halted the fire's progress.

06:13.370 --> 06:16.625
Plausible theory.
You could have
said, "Jack, you're a genius,"

06:16.650 --> 06:19.735
but instead you went
with, "Plausible theory."

06:19.760 --> 06:22.360
Jack, you're a genius.
Too late.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.345
Thomas?

06:46.370 --> 06:47.797
I?

06:47.822 --> 06:50.704
Has your body lost a hand or a wrist?

06:50.729 --> 06:52.829
Uh, no.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.362
16Â¢!

06:58.465 --> 06:59.643
DI Ashton?

07:33.809 --> 07:36.034
Does he have any ID?

07:37.215 --> 07:38.315
Keys.

07:41.574 --> 07:43.862
To a scooter?
Likely.

07:54.809 --> 07:57.347
I'll be outside if you need me.
OK.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.347
Must be nice to have admirers.

08:01.372 --> 08:03.394
Don't start.

08:03.419 --> 08:04.597
So...

08:04.622 --> 08:05.863
One single blast.

08:05.888 --> 08:09.066
Likely he was already on the floor
when the explosion occurred.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.347
Was he already dead?

08:12.372 --> 08:14.019
The blood is pooled.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.894
There's a lack of vital
reaction around the wound.

08:24.060 --> 08:26.799
It's likely to be Darrenjameson.

08:26.824 --> 08:31.549
We traced him through the MSIN
on the phone we found on his body.

08:31.574 --> 08:32.784
Age?

08:35.138 --> 08:37.192
15 years old.

08:59.498 --> 09:00.864
Thomas?

09:05.342 --> 09:07.036
Blisters.

09:09.139 --> 09:11.223
It smells like cat urine.

09:12.451 --> 09:13.661
That's what Thomas said.

09:13.686 --> 09:14.864
Huh.

09:14.889 --> 09:17.754
It's the anhydrous ammonia.
Fertiliser?

09:17.779 --> 09:19.474
Used in fertiliser.

09:19.499 --> 09:21.271
And smells like piss.

09:21.296 --> 09:23.426
Elegant.
Accurate.

09:30.046 --> 09:33.754
Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride sinus tablets.

09:33.779 --> 09:37.318
To turn pseudoephedrine
into methamphetamine,

09:37.343 --> 09:39.582
you soak it in hydrochloric acid

09:39.607 --> 09:42.676
in order to lose the OH molecule,

09:42.701 --> 09:44.676
and then add an H molecule back

09:44.701 --> 09:48.537
by soaking it in NaOH.

09:48.562 --> 09:49.865
Drain cleaner.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.866
Yeah, and that creates a double
bond on the molecule.

09:53.891 --> 09:57.913
You break the double bond
using hydrogen gas...

09:59.001 --> 10:00.976
and nickel metal,

10:01.001 --> 10:04.616
bring the pH level up

10:04.641 --> 10:08.476
by filtering the chemical
through coffee filters,

10:08.501 --> 10:11.428
and then, to make the crystals,

10:11.453 --> 10:15.351
you add ethyl alcohol.

10:16.453 --> 10:18.148
It was a meth lab.

10:18.173 --> 10:22.101
I mean, "lab" makes it
sound too grand, but...

10:24.328 --> 10:27.320
You're basically Walter White
in disguise, aren't you?

10:29.142 --> 10:30.351
The

10:41.736 --> 10:43.945
How was school today, white boy?

10:43.970 --> 10:47.303
You got any money I could borrow, fem?
He's all right, bruv.

10:48.610 --> 10:50.023
Leave him alone.

10:50.048 --> 10:51.428
You're movin' soft.

10:53.251 --> 10:55.789
See you tomorrow, yeah?
Don't forget my money, innit?

10:57.048 --> 10:58.789
You're funny, bruv.

10:58.814 --> 10:59.898
Thank you.

11:01.814 --> 11:04.117
How are you, Noah?
I'm good.

11:04.142 --> 11:05.507
How are you doing, George?

11:06.689 --> 11:08.070
You plant any seeds today?

11:08.095 --> 11:09.179
Time will tell.

11:09.204 --> 11:11.977
Time always tells.

11:13.485 --> 11:14.460
Thanks.

11:36.002 --> 11:38.102
Just want to turn you bad.

11:39.174 --> 11:40.539
Make you a bad girl.

11:44.627 --> 11:45.665
Not going to happen.

11:49.252 --> 11:51.915
Come on, girls.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.150
You're killing me!

11:56.894 --> 11:59.305
You know I think you're peng.

12:15.847 --> 12:17.072
That's very good.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.712
Are you all right, darling?

12:30.004 --> 12:31.776
No. Nothing.

12:33.145 --> 12:34.402
Did you think I didn't look?

12:46.895 --> 12:48.416
Minicab?

12:50.333 --> 12:51.823
How's it going?

12:51.848 --> 12:53.620
Let's talk.

12:53.645 --> 12:55.589
No more fine.

12:56.973 --> 12:58.948
Stupid man blows himself up.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.277
I get new man from home
who don't blow himself up.

13:04.256 --> 13:07.230
If I have nothing to sell, they're
going to go somewhere else.

13:07.255 --> 13:10.792
I got crack. I've got spice
I need to get rid of.

13:10.817 --> 13:12.870
Sell it to the meth-heads
'til we get more.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.870
You get a new boy?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.308
Not yet.

13:18.333 --> 13:22.152
You need a new boy to carry, yeah?
You don't want to be doing that.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.714
Does this make sense?

13:24.739 --> 13:26.073
Mm-hm.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.386
You'll find one, another zana.

13:28.411 --> 13:29.995
OK.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.387
I got good gear coming.

13:31.412 --> 13:32.465
Something special.

13:35.458 --> 13:38.668
You need to work more with the
blacks, get a crew.

13:38.693 --> 13:39.903
It's good business.

13:39.928 --> 13:43.341
Let them run for you,
sell for you, protect you.

13:43.366 --> 13:46.184
Let them make some money. Easy.

13:46.209 --> 13:48.871
Why don't you do that?
You racist, or something?

13:48.896 --> 13:51.028
I'm not racist, no.

13:51.053 --> 13:54.309
Give them money. Make them
feel important.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.699
Easy.

13:55.724 --> 13:58.591
They think they tough.

14:05.896 --> 14:07.153
Alexandre Dumas?

14:09.053 --> 14:12.185
The Three Musketeers,
Count Of Monte Cristo,

14:12.210 --> 14:13.543
The Man In The Iron Mask.

14:13.568 --> 14:16.060
It's like living in a
never-ending quiz show.

14:16.085 --> 14:17.949
Yes, and he was also black.

14:17.974 --> 14:19.668
He was French.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.232
What, you can't be both?

14:21.257 --> 14:23.574
Actually, he was French Haitian.

14:23.599 --> 14:26.825
His grandfather was a white
French nobleman.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.950
His grandmother was a black Haitian slave.

14:28.975 --> 14:31.388
His father was a really
successful French general

14:31.413 --> 14:33.107
whose enemies, including Napoleon,

14:33.132 --> 14:35.341
used to call him the Black Devil.

14:37.491 --> 14:38.513
Pushkin?

14:38.538 --> 14:41.543
He wrote Eugene Onegin,

14:41.568 --> 14:44.466
Boris Godunov and, um, loads of poems.

14:44.491 --> 14:46.575
Just go with "black".

14:46.600 --> 14:48.310
He was black!

14:48.335 --> 14:49.669
Good.

14:49.694 --> 14:51.544
Why?

14:51.569 --> 14:53.341
Pass.

14:53.366 --> 14:55.700
His great-grandfather was from Cameroon.

14:55.725 --> 14:57.982
You know, Pushkin was the greatest Russian poet.

14:58.007 --> 15:01.013
And, yes, he was also black.

15:01.038 --> 15:03.107
Do you think he knew?

15:04.289 --> 15:06.232
See you next week.

15:06.257 --> 15:07.435
Bye!
Bye!

15:10.414 --> 15:11.825
Lord Byron.

15:11.850 --> 15:13.983
Lord Byron was not black!

15:14.008 --> 15:15.935
L

15:15.960 --> 15:17.061
But he wishes he was!

15:17.086 --> 15:20.858
Cultural appropriation?
I'd be guessing.

15:20.883 --> 15:22.419
Hmm.

15:22.444 --> 15:24.639
Cultural celebration, actually!

15:24.664 --> 15:27.311
Why do you celebrate drug-dealing,
misogynistic rap artists?

15:27.336 --> 15:29.669
I don't celebrate them.

15:29.694 --> 15:32.467
Well, maybe I want to celebrate
black culture.

15:32.492 --> 15:34.669
Oh, you think drill is black culture?

15:34.694 --> 15:36.950
I think it reflects a time and a place.

15:36.975 --> 15:40.497
That is not black culture.
Dumas is black culture.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.747
That's the whole point!

15:42.772 --> 15:45.217
Can we eat?

15:45.242 --> 15:46.669
Yeah.

16:02.539 --> 16:04.545
You never going to play
for England, though.

16:04.570 --> 16:07.545
You don't know shit.
He knows one
thing that you don't know.

16:07.570 --> 16:08.670
What's that?

16:13.648 --> 16:17.469
...I'm being dead serious.
My man's probably on, what, 100K a year?

16:24.571 --> 16:27.109
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you, man.

16:29.134 --> 16:31.345
You! Uh... you got anything?

16:31.370 --> 16:34.578
You know, just help me take the edge off?

16:34.603 --> 16:35.782
You got coin?

16:37.214 --> 16:39.672
Yeah. I'll pay you tomorrow.

16:39.697 --> 16:41.111
Shit.

16:42.822 --> 16:47.033
Something that can help.
Don't touch
me, man. Get out of here.

16:48.448 --> 16:52.626
What is she talking about?
She was so dead, blud.

16:52.651 --> 16:54.471
I don't even know, bruv.

16:54.496 --> 16:57.112
It's OK. I'll help you.

17:04.246 --> 17:05.471
I got something.

17:06.809 --> 17:07.784
Y

17:12.371 --> 17:13.346
Pay you tomorrow?

17:15.605 --> 17:16.659
Pay me now.

18:10.373 --> 18:12.581
Moi Burnt.

18:12.606 --> 18:15.941
Acid?
Inhalation.

18:18.856 --> 18:21.098
Ulceration of the respiratory tract.

18:24.967 --> 18:27.145
Lungs probably oedematous.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.456
A result of the lungs

18:28.481 --> 18:31.675
coming into contact with
hydrochloric acid fumes.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.223
A chest wound 7

18:33.248 --> 18:36.831
Penetrating projectile wound.
Yes, debris from the explosion.

18:39.936 --> 18:41.911
Part of a table leg.

18:41.936 --> 18:44.192
But it had nothing to do
with the cause of death.

18:44.217 --> 18:45.989
There's a lack of internal bleeding

18:46.014 --> 18:49.348
that would confirm that he was
dead before he was impaled.

18:49.373 --> 18:52.473
Darren inhaled HCL fumes.

18:52.498 --> 18:56.067
His airways, sinuses and lungs

18:56.092 --> 18:59.832
were burnt by the fumes, causing
acute respiratory distress syndrome

18:59.857 --> 19:01.582
and asphyxiation.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.067
Second victim?

19:03.092 --> 19:04.300
Same cause of death?

19:04.325 --> 19:07.661
Uh, no. No.

19:07.686 --> 19:10.223
He did not inhale the fumes...

19:10.248 --> 19:13.067
...we think because he was wearing this.

19:13.092 --> 19:15.504
Some sort of filtered face mask.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.911
Yes, it's likely that he
was the cook.

19:18.936 --> 19:20.895
Injuries were multiple blast and burns.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.332
You can see he resembles a bomb victim.

19:23.357 --> 19:25.146
So he was close to the
seat of the blast?

19:27.967 --> 19:31.224
Which is consistent with
him making methamphetamine.

19:31.249 --> 19:32.957
Do we know who he is?

19:32.982 --> 19:35.396
We're going to struggle.

19:35.421 --> 19:37.629
We've got a DNA profile, but no match.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.146
No criminal record?
That we've found, no.

19:39.171 --> 19:41.318
The severe burns to his body and face

19:41.343 --> 19:43.707
will make identification difficult.

19:43.732 --> 19:46.551
We'll run further tests as necessary,
but the CT scan indicates

19:46.576 --> 19:48.504
he's a white male, approximately
40 years old.

19:48.529 --> 19:52.271
So Darren Jameson was a drug dealer
collecting the crystal meth

19:52.296 --> 19:55.068
that the unknown victim was making.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.146
Yeah.

19:57.374 --> 19:59.896
Good morning. It's Noah Taylor from Cerrington

19:59.921 --> 20:02.537
calling about your son's attendance.

20:02.562 --> 20:04.458
He has a number of unexcused absences,

20:04.483 --> 20:06.021
and he's not here again today.

20:10.687 --> 20:11.662
Mrs Jameson?

20:13.093 --> 20:14.740
Mrs Jameson, are you OK?

20:14.765 --> 20:18.051
Yeah, he...he was in an accident.

20:18.076 --> 20:19.380
He...

20:19.405 --> 20:21.974
Oh, lam terribly sorry to hear that, Mrs Jameson.

20:23.890 --> 20:29.068
If there's anything I can do...
OK.
Yeah.
Thank you.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.427
Mr Taylor?

20:36.452 --> 20:38.271
There are some police officers here to see you.

20:43.015 --> 20:45.225
I was actually just talking with his mother.

20:45.250 --> 20:48.380
How did he die?
There was an accident.

20:48.405 --> 20:51.631
We can't really say more than
that at the moment.
Of course.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.506
Here we are.

20:57.453 --> 20:58.413
Thank you.

21:01.531 --> 21:02.506
Cheers.

21:04.719 --> 21:09.274
So sad, you know, a young person. The potential.

21:10.377 --> 21:13.868
We'll let you know when we're done.
Yeah. Course.

21:18.532 --> 21:21.352
You didn't want to tell him
his student was a drug dealer?

21:21.377 --> 21:23.507
It's what we think, it's not what we know.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.429
I don't want to leap to conclusions.

21:25.454 --> 21:27.711
That's not much of a leap.

21:27.736 --> 21:30.179
I like to keep an open mind,

21:30.204 --> 21:32.868
stay open to possibilities.

21:53.205 --> 21:55.899
He's got an admirer.

21:55.924 --> 21:59.586
You see an admirer, I see
three months of male indecision,

21:59.611 --> 22:02.180
confusion and hurt.

22:04.128 --> 22:06.071
He's never that funny.

22:06.096 --> 22:08.900
Jack. Jack. Two minutes, please.

22:08.925 --> 22:11.025
Urn, I'd better go.

22:11.050 --> 22:12.665
Oh, OK.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.258
Should we...

22:15.440 --> 22:17.150
"get a drink sometime?

22:21.768 --> 22:23.462
Oh.

22:23.487 --> 22:24.869
Oh.

22:25.972 --> 22:27.383
See you later.
OK.

22:27.408 --> 22:28.415
Yeah.

22:32.533 --> 22:33.870
Right. Shall we?

22:41.426 --> 22:42.634
Hello?

22:42.659 --> 22:44.306
Now you've got my number.

22:49.895 --> 22:51.698
Oh, boy.

22:51.723 --> 22:54.948
That's the shield over his left pectoral.

22:54.973 --> 22:59.276
It's a synthetic fibre,
most likely polyester.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.823
Huh. He was wearing a sport shirt.

23:07.848 --> 23:11.948
And the letters there, inside the shield?

23:11.973 --> 23:13.855
Do they know whose lock-up it was?

23:13.880 --> 23:16.230
Mmm, council. Tenant sublet it for cash.

23:16.255 --> 23:18.339
Is that a P?

23:18.364 --> 23:20.339
Yeah. A...

23:21.722 --> 23:23.791
...T, that looks like a Z.

23:23.816 --> 23:25.902
Oh, uh, Partizani.

23:25.927 --> 23:27.666
PK Parthani. Tirana.

23:27.691 --> 23:29.230
Albania.

23:29.255 --> 23:31.230
He's Albanian?
He might not be Albanian.

23:31.255 --> 23:33.745
He might simply support an Albanian team.

23:33.770 --> 23:37.261
Why would you do that?

24:00.333 --> 24:01.870
Are you OK?

24:01.895 --> 24:03.355
Yes, sir.

24:03.380 --> 24:05.745
Why aren't you in class?

24:05.770 --> 24:07.590
Don't tell me.

24:07.615 --> 24:08.995
Lysette.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.698
Why aren't you in class, Lysette?

24:11.723 --> 24:14.277
I'm meant to do reading practice
with Miss Carthew,

24:14.302 --> 24:16.230
but I think she's forgot.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.465
Did she?

24:18.490 --> 24:20.590
Well, there's a lot on at the moment.

24:20.615 --> 24:22.262
I could do it with you.

24:22.287 --> 24:23.465
Yes, sir.

24:25.365 --> 24:26.745
What are you reading?

24:29.131 --> 24:31.137
Roald Dahl Do you know where you are?

24:35.662 --> 24:37.745
Sophie watched with...

24:41.053 --> 24:44.495
As-ton-ishment.
...as-ton-ishment.

24:45.662 --> 24:49.215
"What a strange and...moo...

24:49.240 --> 24:51.715
Moo.
Moo...
Moody, like the cow.

24:53.131 --> 24:57.542
"..moody creature this is," she thought.

24:57.567 --> 25:00.232
That's very good. Keep going.

25:05.491 --> 25:06.904
You read really good, sir.

25:08.616 --> 25:10.264
You read very well, sir.

25:11.694 --> 25:13.186
You speak well, too.

25:31.601 --> 25:32.859
Are you coming?

25:32.884 --> 25:34.295
We're going to be late.

25:36.181 --> 25:38.437
What did Jesse say he was doing?

25:38.462 --> 25:39.795
He'll meet us there.

25:42.445 --> 25:44.623
What will be, will be.

25:46.056 --> 25:47.623
Doesn't make me want it any less.

26:08.415 --> 26:09.702
I'm so sorry.

26:28.494 --> 26:32.031
This is much better than tina,
and it doesn't blow up!

26:32.056 --> 26:33.313
Very, very good.

26:33.338 --> 26:34.671
Dance fever.

26:34.696 --> 26:36.625
Use it straight or mix it.

26:36.650 --> 26:38.189
They're going to like this.

26:38.214 --> 26:39.625
Going to sell easy.

26:39.650 --> 26:40.907
Doesn't need much.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.986
Little snap bags.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.876
Goodnight, Debbie.
Goodnight, Mr Taylor.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.862
Mum!

28:00.887 --> 28:02.425
Talk to me!

28:02.450 --> 28:05.378
Please! Mum.

28:05.403 --> 28:07.535
What's wrong with you?

28:07.560 --> 28:10.424
What is it?
Please, sir. Please help her.

28:10.449 --> 28:12.660
Who is it?
My mother.

28:12.685 --> 28:14.738
Oh, God.

28:14.763 --> 28:17.347
OK.
Mum, what's wrong with you?

28:17.372 --> 28:19.098
Mum!

28:19.123 --> 28:21.613
Yes, uh, I need an ambulance.

28:21.638 --> 28:24.503
I don't know. I really
don't know what's wrong.

28:34.888 --> 28:37.020
M

28:37.045 --> 28:40.706
Sopranos, stop parbfiflflf

29:05.014 --> 29:06.629
Spice.

29:15.607 --> 29:17.223
Why do they freeze?

29:18.920 --> 29:21.755
Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists -

29:21.780 --> 29:24.787
disrupts the motor cortex in the brain,

29:24.812 --> 29:28.349
gives a sense of impossible
lethargy and heaviness.

29:29.499 --> 29:32.630
Can you hear me? We're going
to walk you to the ambulance.

29:32.655 --> 29:34.146
Get off!

29:34.171 --> 29:36.193
Whoa! That's mad!

29:36.218 --> 29:37.225
Stay back, please.

29:37.250 --> 29:39.474
Come on. Come here.

29:39.499 --> 29:41.912
Don't hurt her! Please!
Come back over here, please.

29:41.937 --> 29:44.069
Come with me. She'll be much better off.

29:44.094 --> 29:46.177
That's it.
Mum!

29:46.202 --> 29:47.913
Hold her down!
Come, wait over here.

29:47.938 --> 29:49.834
Stop it.

29:49.859 --> 29:51.069
Hold her off, come on.

29:51.094 --> 29:53.069
Turn her over. Come on.

29:53.094 --> 29:55.147
Get her on. Hold her down.

29:55.172 --> 29:56.506
Let her go. Get off her.

29:56.531 --> 29:58.101
Get
her on.
Let her go.

30:00.297 --> 30:02.789
Leave her on the ground.
She's hallucinating.

30:26.769 --> 30:28.072
Are they gone?

30:29.533 --> 30:31.383
Yeah.

30:32.566 --> 30:33.744
Are they coming?

30:33.769 --> 30:35.228
Ow!

30:35.253 --> 30:37.619
You're in my head! You're in my head.

30:37.644 --> 30:39.180
Let go!

30:39.205 --> 30:42.633
You're in my head. Get out!

30:42.658 --> 30:46.384
They're eating my brain...

30:46.409 --> 30:47.791
Get out!

30:47.816 --> 30:50.744
Let go... so we can help you.

30:55.050 --> 30:57.430
No-one can help me.

31:03.409 --> 31:05.229
All right, next week, we're
working on Motherless Child,

31:05.254 --> 31:06.837
so please have a look at it.

31:06.862 --> 31:10.104
Now, we don't have many rehearsals
left before our performance,

31:10.129 --> 31:12.822
so please, please, please
try not to miss them.

31:12.847 --> 31:15.072
Thanks, guys. See you next week.

31:18.175 --> 31:19.509
I'll go help Mum, yeah?

31:22.612 --> 31:24.462
What's up? What are you doing?

31:24.487 --> 31:25.712
Going to study.

31:25.737 --> 31:26.837
What are you doing?

31:26.862 --> 31:28.431
Going to be heartbroken.

31:28.456 --> 31:30.306
Yeah?
Yeah.

31:30.331 --> 31:31.354
Good luck with that.

31:31.379 --> 31:32.541
Won't need luck.

31:32.566 --> 31:33.634
Easy with you.

31:34.816 --> 31:35.901
That was good.

31:36.926 --> 31:38.259
Tell my mum.

31:38.284 --> 31:39.620
You don't think I will?

31:39.645 --> 31:41.948
Never going to happen.

31:41.973 --> 31:45.745
Ms Taylor? The choir was fu...

31:45.770 --> 31:46.745
Glen!

31:48.129 --> 31:50.667
The choir was very good.

31:53.081 --> 31:54.119
Thank you.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.058
Told you.

32:00.567 --> 32:03.542
Who's that boy?
No-one.
Well, Faith
seems to like him.

32:03.567 --> 32:04.823
She needs to stay away from him.

32:04.848 --> 32:06.620
She doesn't want to get involved in all that.

32:06.645 --> 32:08.698
Involved in what?
Nothing.

32:21.536 --> 32:23.340
Do you know who Pushkin is?

32:23.365 --> 32:24.668
Haven't got a clue.

32:40.178 --> 32:41.388
See ya.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.232
Overdose?

32:58.100 --> 33:00.668
No obvious sign of injury or assault.

33:00.693 --> 33:02.466
Ready?

33:03.568 --> 33:05.029
Do we have a name for the deceased?

33:08.616 --> 33:10.793
John Smith.

33:13.694 --> 33:15.543
That guy's a comedian.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.794
Thanks.

33:33.085 --> 33:37.264
Darling, you're just going to
come with me. Is that all right?

33:37.289 --> 33:39.544
I saw one of my students rather distressed.

33:39.569 --> 33:43.467
She was with two people.
The woman is the mother.

33:45.335 --> 33:47.294
Lysette is her daughter.

33:51.569 --> 33:55.311
Don't worry, Social Services have been called.

34:00.975 --> 34:02.950
All of that craziness on the floor, like...

34:02.975 --> 34:05.983
Why are you laughing?
Mr Taylor...

34:09.882 --> 34:13.389
What about this is funny?
Mr Taylor, let it go.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.826
I'm talking to you.

34:17.851 --> 34:19.905
There is nothing funny here!

34:19.929 --> 34:21.701
There's nothing funny.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.467
Relax yourself.
Who are you?

34:24.492 --> 34:25.717
Don't do it.

34:25.742 --> 34:27.545
It's not worth it.

34:31.132 --> 34:33.623
Yeah, listen to your boy.

34:33.648 --> 34:34.827
It's cool, man.

34:46.011 --> 34:49.110
She's alive. Better if she was dead.

34:53.215 --> 34:55.751
Go after them. Yeah? Go.

35:05.496 --> 35:07.829
You're angry.

35:08.887 --> 35:11.143
Yes, lam angry.

35:11.168 --> 35:13.423
They trample on your seeds.

35:16.762 --> 35:18.346
All over them.

35:20.651 --> 35:23.268
It's OK to be angry.

35:38.606 --> 35:41.019
Ooh! Uh-ooh!

35:43.403 --> 35:44.972
What's good, man?
Hello, lonely boy.

35:44.997 --> 35:46.347
Where you coming from?

35:46.372 --> 35:47.988
Coming from...

35:48.013 --> 35:50.706
Why you so lonely? Go to
see your girlfriend?

35:50.731 --> 35:51.988
See the girlfriend...

35:52.013 --> 35:53.675
just cos you get turned down.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.597
I'm joking-
Somebody! here, man.

35:55.622 --> 35:57.425
What you telling me?

35:57.450 --> 35:59.581
You good?
I'm good.

35:59.606 --> 36:01.675
Hey, man, who's this?

36:11.561 --> 36:13.036
Do you want to make some money?

36:16.170 --> 36:17.426
Good money.

36:18.529 --> 36:20.550
How good, Mud

36:24.217 --> 36:25.426
We can get you anything.

36:25.451 --> 36:27.817
Sell baggies if you want.

36:27.842 --> 36:28.989
Smoke.

36:29.014 --> 36:31.020
I got started selling baggies at school.

36:31.045 --> 36:34.989
Easy. And we can get you this.

36:35.014 --> 36:36.270
Fentanyl.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.349
Dance fever.

36:38.374 --> 36:41.224
Better than ice.

36:41.249 --> 36:43.551
Makes the customer loyal.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.379
They gotta have it.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.864
Lots of ways to use it -

36:46.889 --> 36:50.067
you can sprinkle it on brown or grass.

36:50.092 --> 36:52.036
Only need a little.

36:52.061 --> 36:53.864
Blows your head off.

36:53.889 --> 36:56.957
Makes 'em need more. A slave to it.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.582
The best customer is a slave,

36:59.607 --> 37:02.193
and the best slave...

37:02.218 --> 37:04.629
...is the one who thinks he's free.

37:06.499 --> 37:07.943
Let me see that.

37:10.171 --> 37:14.301
This shit is so strong it's
better you use gloves.

37:17.404 --> 37:19.754
Shut up, bruv. Why you laughing, bruv?

37:23.529 --> 37:26.379
The guy we found in the high street
today, was it spice?

37:26.404 --> 37:28.818
We'll have results in the morning.
Do we have a name for him?

37:28.843 --> 37:32.021
There was a name and an
employee ID card in his wallet,

37:32.046 --> 37:35.301
confirming it now.
Let me know when
you have it, yeah?
Yeah.

37:35.326 --> 37:37.865
Used to work in a call centre
for an insurance company.

37:37.890 --> 37:39.629
Wore a tie to work.

37:39.654 --> 37:41.943
Don't imagine he thought he
would end up like this.

37:45.327 --> 37:47.037
So, a friend invited me to dinner last week.

37:47.062 --> 37:49.662
You have friends?
Hard to believe, I know.

37:49.687 --> 37:53.630
I say friend, more of an acquaintance.

37:53.655 --> 37:56.865
We met at a forensic conference in Cranleigh.

37:56.890 --> 38:00.818
I think he was trying to set me
up with someone.
Did it work?
No.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.740
Got that T-shirt.

38:02.765 --> 38:05.600
Lot of smart people talking
about global warming,

38:05.625 --> 38:07.177
organic food, the NHS...

38:07.202 --> 38:09.458
And after the creme brulee,

38:09.483 --> 38:11.177
out came a little bag of cocaine

38:11.202 --> 38:14.787
and a little mirror,
and they start passing it around.

38:14.812 --> 38:16.302
I'm sure they'd no idea why I left,

38:16.327 --> 38:19.397
nor do they realise that
they are the end of the supply chain.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.755
The money.

38:20.780 --> 38:24.630
They have no idea that
they're responsible for the gangs

38:24.655 --> 38:26.100
and for the knives, because...

38:26.125 --> 38:28.833
...because they don't see
the carnage they leave along the way.

38:28.858 --> 38:30.537
The addicts who can't help themselves.

38:30.562 --> 38:33.631
The victims who made bad decisions.

38:34.766 --> 38:36.100
Cutting room.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.584
Your lab. This place.

38:38.609 --> 38:41.256
They're a monument to bad decisions.

38:41.281 --> 38:43.459
I know it's a crime, but
I don't know how to solve it.

38:43.484 --> 38:46.664
It's not one crime, it's
more than we can count.

38:46.689 --> 38:49.617
But we can only do what
we can - help find the people

38:49.642 --> 38:53.132
who sell the crystal meth,
help find the people who sell the spice

38:53.157 --> 38:55.274
and make money from other people's pain.

39:16.002 --> 39:16.977
Spice boy?

39:18.204 --> 39:19.460
Yeah.

39:19.485 --> 39:21.946
Any surprises?
Nope.

39:21.971 --> 39:24.632
Haemorrhagic stroke in the parietal lobe.

39:24.657 --> 39:26.336
Catastrophic.

39:26.361 --> 39:28.304
Have you tested for synthetic cannabinoids?

39:28.329 --> 39:33.508
Yeah, we found SF-ADB, pyrethroids,
piperonyl butoxide and permethrin.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.586
Permethrin.

39:41.611 --> 39:43.305
They often spray the leaves
with cockroach killer.

39:43.330 --> 39:45.149
So what causes the stroke?

39:45.174 --> 39:46.274
All of it.

39:46.299 --> 39:47.743
Why would you put that in your body?

39:47.768 --> 39:50.071
It used to be legal. What were they thinking?

39:50.096 --> 39:52.102
Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol

39:52.127 --> 39:53.743
can trigger atrial fibrillation,

39:53.768 --> 39:56.461
increase your risk of stroke
by 500%. Shall we ban alcohol?

39:56.486 --> 39:58.305
Well, you're not saying you think
that spice should be made legal?

39:58.330 --> 40:00.947
Since it was criminalised,
it became much more dangerous.

40:00.972 --> 40:04.462
The makers use insecticides
to disguise the active ingredients

40:04.487 --> 40:06.056
so it can't be traced.

40:06.081 --> 40:07.635
So we can't trace the maker?

40:07.660 --> 40:09.181
It's very difficult.

40:09.206 --> 40:11.823
Aren't you in the business of very difficult?

40:13.301 --> 40:15.026
Synthetic cannabinoids are dangerous.

40:15.051 --> 40:17.948
People invented them to escape prosecution -

40:17.973 --> 40:21.135
one of the unexpected consequences
of not legalising marijuana.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.026
Legalise it. Regulate it. Tax it.

40:24.051 --> 40:26.135
And John Smith in the
cutting room wouldn't be dead.

40:26.160 --> 40:29.995
He'd be dead, it would just be
from a different drug.

40:30.020 --> 40:33.980
You don't want to come back here.
You'll be fine, OK? OK. Bye-bye.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.387
Hello, Pamela.

40:41.412 --> 40:43.387
Listen, let us help you.

40:43.412 --> 40:44.652
I don't need help.

40:44.677 --> 40:45.855
Then maybe you can help us.

40:47.677 --> 40:50.184
We want to keep you safe.

40:50.209 --> 40:52.495
Who's going to look after you?
Keep away from me!

40:54.692 --> 40:58.105
I'm watching you, Pamela.
Leave me alone!

41:33.740 --> 41:35.434
Hi, Mr Taylor.
Afternoon.

41:36.849 --> 41:39.824
Have we heard from Social
Services yet?
I haven't.

41:39.849 --> 41:41.387
Is Lysette in class?
No, sir.

41:41.412 --> 41:43.309
What are you lot looking at?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.699
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

41:45.724 --> 41:47.621
I think you're
right, I think...

41:57.599 --> 41:59.574
You take that.

41:59.599 --> 42:01.106
Now you...

42:03.974 --> 42:09.091
You are coming with me.
Get off me,
bruv! Get off me, bruv!

42:09.288 --> 42:12.153
These are my students! I will
not allow you to harm them.

42:12.178 --> 42:13.746
I will not allow it!

42:13.771 --> 42:15.904
Come on.

42:15.929 --> 42:19.091
Come on. I'll shank you up, you know.

42:20.693 --> 42:25.341
You want it, Mud
This, for them?
You want to give this to them?

42:25.366 --> 42:27.982
Why would you just squander
your own opportunities?

42:28.007 --> 42:29.779
Oh, yeah, big man.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.217
You're nothing.

42:36.165 --> 42:37.593
And you're gone.

42:37.618 --> 42:38.826
Get out.

42:38.851 --> 42:40.140
Go on, get out of here.

42:40.165 --> 42:41.390
Yeah, go, get out.

42:41.415 --> 42:43.545
Run! Go on.

42:45.601 --> 42:49.030
Get your bags, take the shit with you.

42:49.055 --> 42:52.265
Get out! Get the hell out of here!

43:00.851 --> 43:02.748
You three, come here.

43:02.773 --> 43:04.748
He's coming.
Whoa.

43:11.884 --> 43:14.015
May I?

43:15.931 --> 43:19.077
People take this to forget who they are.

43:19.102 --> 43:21.234
I don't want you to forget who you are.

43:21.259 --> 43:25.062
I don't want you to.
I want you to remember everything.

43:28.009 --> 43:32.469
This is a tool of oppression
designed to keep you down...

43:32.494 --> 43:34.265
"and make others rich.

43:55.400 --> 43:59.547
Yeah, she's with me at the moment.

43:59.572 --> 44:03.033
We don't know where the mother
is. Stay with her for now.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.658
Yeah. Yeah, that's not a problem.

44:05.683 --> 44:07.814
And can you inform the school?

44:07.839 --> 44:09.704
Yeah, I can let them know.

44:09.729 --> 44:11.579
That's fine.

44:11.604 --> 44:12.861
Amanda?

44:17.730 --> 44:19.659
Can I go to school?

44:21.199 --> 44:22.862
I'll see you tomorrow.

44:22.887 --> 44:24.502
All right. Bye.
Bye.

44:26.855 --> 44:28.347
You want to go somewhere dark?

44:28.372 --> 44:29.877
Jog on.

44:29.902 --> 44:31.222
I can't get you out of my head.

44:31.247 --> 44:33.580
I have to go. I've got practice.

44:35.324 --> 44:37.299
You coming to the Gauntlet tonight?

44:39.574 --> 44:42.580
Ah! You miss me already.

44:44.169 --> 44:45.580
You coming tonight?

44:50.810 --> 44:52.316
Don't do that!

44:52.341 --> 44:54.752
Somebody might see.

45:17.654 --> 45:20.145
Sorry. ls Jack here?

45:20.170 --> 45:23.129
No. I'm not sure where he is.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.457
What are you after? Hm?

45:24.482 --> 45:26.020
Oh, I just...

45:26.045 --> 45:27.457
I wanted to ask him a question.

45:27.482 --> 45:29.223
Can I help?

45:30.326 --> 45:32.474
No, it's OK, I don't think so.

45:32.499 --> 45:34.832
I am capable of answering questions.

45:37.654 --> 45:39.301
OK.

46:00.732 --> 46:02.989
Faith!
What?
Post!

46:06.326 --> 46:08.021
Feels thin.
Open it!

46:13.250 --> 46:14.772
And...?

46:14.797 --> 46:15.991
I got in.
Yes!

46:17.578 --> 46:18.788
St. Hugh's?

46:18.813 --> 46:20.742
A St Hugh's woman?

46:20.767 --> 46:22.178
I am so proud!

46:22.203 --> 46:24.070
So proud of you!

46:24.095 --> 46:27.023
College of the Prime Minister,
leaders of nations.

46:27.048 --> 46:28.898
You know, the principal there
was the first woman

46:28.923 --> 46:31.851
to be Lord Advocate of
Scotland.
Noah, please,

46:31.876 --> 46:34.584
just celebrate your daughter,
not the whole of womankind.

46:34.609 --> 46:36.709
That's what I'm doing, of course.
Yeah, right.

46:39.095 --> 46:42.381
D...A...

46:44.531 --> 46:45.710
Hey there.

46:45.735 --> 46:48.664
Hey. Your friend was here.

46:48.689 --> 46:51.539
Care to narrow that down at all?

46:51.564 --> 46:53.820
Police officer - Katie.

46:53.845 --> 46:55.617
Ashton?

46:55.642 --> 46:57.178
Yeah, that's her name.

46:57.203 --> 46:58.617
Whafd she want?

46:58.642 --> 47:00.178
Had a question.

47:00.203 --> 47:02.226
Wouldn't ask it.

47:02.251 --> 47:04.664
Maybe she wanted to ask you
something private.

47:06.252 --> 47:07.774
Who knows?

47:07.799 --> 47:09.539
What are we doing?

47:09.564 --> 47:12.820
We are collecting DNA from the helmet

47:12.845 --> 47:15.460
to confirm it was worn by Darren,

47:15.485 --> 47:18.414
and you are testing the inside
of a scooter box.

47:18.439 --> 47:19.695
For what?

47:19.720 --> 47:21.460
A takeaway?

47:27.282 --> 47:30.710
Don't be out late.
We won't be.
Where are you going?

47:30.735 --> 47:32.024
Meeting some friends at the Gauntlet.

47:32.049 --> 47:34.179
Well, if it gets too late,
take a taxi home.

47:34.204 --> 47:35.335
Yeah, and be careful.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.822
Faith, I'm going to go, OK?

49:00.847 --> 49:03.619
It's OK. I'll be at home in a bit.

49:03.644 --> 49:04.868
Cool.

49:20.566 --> 49:22.416
You got anything for me?

49:34.770 --> 49:36.026
Smoke?

49:56.098 --> 49:57.948
You going to get with him?
Maybe.

50:04.130 --> 50:05.230
You need a cigarette?

50:07.161 --> 50:09.698
Thank you. That's really kind.

50:09.723 --> 50:11.465
A pleasure.

50:11.490 --> 50:12.823
Girls' night out?

50:12.848 --> 50:15.698
Mm-hm.
Come. Talk to me.

50:15.723 --> 50:18.573
As thanks for the cigarette.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.370
You come here often?

50:20.395 --> 50:23.387
No, this is the first time
I've been here. Have you?

50:23.412 --> 50:28.027
We always go out together.
Where's the boyfriend?

50:28.052 --> 50:29.465
Do you have a boyfriend?

50:31.365 --> 50:34.371
Where's Faith?
...Someone special
like you...

50:35.928 --> 50:38.653
Faith? What are you doing?
You're here!

50:41.724 --> 50:42.934
Where's your bodyguard?

50:44.241 --> 50:47.903
Your brother?
Oh, he's gone home.
Want to go somewhere dark?

50:57.492 --> 50:59.622
Oh, shit. What's going on?
Come, come, come.

50:59.647 --> 51:02.139
What's wrong with her?
Come on, babe, wake up. Faith?

51:03.336 --> 51:04.857
Faith?
Wake up.

51:04.882 --> 51:05.983
Faith, it's me...

51:06.008 --> 51:07.622
We got to go, fam.

51:07.647 --> 51:09.825
No, you're not listening, we got to go!

51:09.850 --> 51:11.029
Faith, wake up!

51:11.054 --> 51:14.311
We've got to go now. We gotta go, bruv!

51:14.336 --> 51:15.950
Let's go, brother, go, go!

51:15.975 --> 51:18.234
You guys look after her.

51:18.259 --> 51:19.702
Call an ambulance!
Call me, innit?

51:19.727 --> 51:21.140
Faith...
Come on.

51:22.415 --> 51:25.295
Faith!
Wake up, please, it's me.

52:05.087 --> 52:06.749
Hello?

52:06.774 --> 52:09.672
Hello, Mrs Taylor, this is
the hospital A&E department...

52:14.932 --> 52:17.783
They've taken her to hospital.
She'll be OK.

52:36.294 --> 52:37.627
Is she OK?

52:55.449 --> 52:57.299
Mommy's here...

53:02.686 --> 53:04.378
Hey, babba.

53:07.528 --> 53:08.786
Mommy's here.

53:10.811 --> 53:11.895
Daddy's here.

53:15.529 --> 53:17.223
Mr and Mrs Taylor?

53:20.170 --> 53:21.661
I'm sorry to have to tell you

53:21.686 --> 53:24.300
that we're not seeing any
signs of brain activity.

53:25.842 --> 53:27.942
When you're ready, I can
explain what that means

53:27.967 --> 53:29.067
and what the options are.

53:31.357 --> 53:32.865
Thank you.

53:35.811 --> 53:39.504
Please, Father, please,
Father, please, I beg you to do this.

53:59.609 --> 54:01.991
Shh, shh, shh...

54:02.016 --> 54:03.475
Mommy's here.

54:14.656 --> 54:16.584
Crash team!
Faith?

54:16.609 --> 54:18.256
Can you step out, please?
Faith!

54:18.281 --> 54:21.100
What is it?
Faith! Tell me what's...

54:21.125 --> 54:24.944
She's arrested. Come with me.
No... Faith! I don't want to go!

54:24.969 --> 54:27.226
What's happening 7
I don't want to go!
Do something!

54:27.251 --> 54:30.506
I love you, my little girl, I love you!

54:30.531 --> 54:32.772
Adrenaline.
Going with compressions.

54:36.859 --> 54:37.944
Anything?

54:37.969 --> 54:39.741
No.

55:13.767 --> 55:16.428
Did you know
your daughter used drugs?

55:16.453 --> 55:19.664
Her respiratory system
slowed down till it stopped.

55:19.689 --> 55:22.867
Where did she get the drugs?
I don't know.

55:22.892 --> 55:24.992
You wouldn't lie to me?
No.

55:26.126 --> 55:28.428
Safe. You got one for you?

55:28.453 --> 55:29.506
Yeah.

55:29.531 --> 55:32.539
Who do you think you are? You
think you're better than me, innit?

55:32.564 --> 55:34.695
That's what you think.

55:34.720 --> 55:36.382
No-one's going to come in.

55:38.017 --> 55:39.945
It's mental what happened, yeah?

55:39.970 --> 55:42.023
Anyone asking questions,
you don't say nothing.

55:42.048 --> 55:45.257
Glen Cole is our main suspect.
I believe your daughter knew him?

55:45.282 --> 55:48.570
I need your help, Jesse. I'm
sorry about your sister, innit?

55:48.595 --> 55:50.554
Do you think she knew what she was smoking?

55:50.579 --> 55:54.258
No. But how can we be certain?

55:55.408 --> 55:56.665
I didn't kill nobody.

55:56.690 --> 55:58.868
I know who gave her the drugs.

55:58.893 --> 56:01.665
I'll go to prison because that's
what happens to people like me.

56:01.690 --> 56:03.180
I've found something!

56:03.205 --> 56:06.180
Someone call a paramedic!
