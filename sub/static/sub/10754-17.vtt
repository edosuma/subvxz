00:22.689 --> 00:24.357
Dad!

00:26.068 --> 00:28.111
Daphne!

00:29.988 --> 00:32.198
Anybody home?

00:39.497 --> 00:45.211
(Plays a serene classical melody)

00:47.213 --> 00:50.675
(Improvises a clichéd intro)

00:53.887 --> 00:56.222
(Repeats his intro)

01:13.389 --> 01:18.177
(Hurriedly reverts
to playing classical music)

01:18.178 --> 01:22.932
- You're making a big deal of this.
- Dad, I've never seen Maris this angry.

01:23.099 --> 01:27.103
Her eye was twitching
like a frog in a science experiment.

01:28.813 --> 01:35.069
When your mother got mad, I'd bend
her backwards and give her a kiss.

01:35.236 --> 01:40.616
I can't do that with Maris.
She has rigid vertebrae. She'd snap.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.038
Maris moved into the east wing again?

01:45.204 --> 01:50.460
Sunday was her 40th birthday. She
said she wanted no acknowledgement.

01:50.626 --> 01:54.964
In a moment I live over and over
in my dreams, I believed her!

01:56.007 --> 01:58.676
No gifts, no party, no nothing?

01:58.843 --> 02:03.764
Say that weeping into a lap robe
and you've got her down perfectly.

02:03.931 --> 02:06.392
- Get her perfume.
- She gets hives.

02:06.559 --> 02:09.353
- Candy?
- Hypoglycaemic.

02:09.520 --> 02:13.149
- A dozen roses?
- Allergic.

02:13.316 --> 02:16.902
Just sit her down
and tell her it was a mistake.

02:17.069 --> 02:21.574
She's touchy about her age.
It's not the first time she's turned 40.

02:26.203 --> 02:29.415
I know. I'll throw a big party
this weekend.

02:29.582 --> 02:33.169
A costume ball
with a Louis XIV theme,

02:33.335 --> 02:36.922
right down to the wigs
and velvet pantaloons.

02:37.089 --> 02:39.133
I presume you both have colds?

02:41.635 --> 02:43.846
And so it goes.

02:45.139 --> 02:51.145
Did you find a book lying around?
The station manager loaned it to me.

02:51.312 --> 02:56.984
"The Life of Sir Herbert Beerbohm
Tree". A history of English theatre.

02:57.151 --> 03:01.697
You caught me.
It got it hidden under my pillow.

03:02.698 --> 03:05.868
Try to be helpful.
I promised I'd return it today.

03:06.034 --> 03:10.330
Ask Daphne. She wanted
something to put her to sleep.

03:10.497 --> 03:13.792
That book could put her into a coma!

04:28.449 --> 04:30.952
- Dr Crane!
- Daphne!

04:31.119 --> 04:33.705
What are you doing in my room?

04:33.872 --> 04:38.668
You were out. Not that l
come in here when you're out.

04:38.835 --> 04:42.922
I came in to get my book.
Which I have, you see.

04:44.757 --> 04:46.801
We'll just be going.

04:46.968 --> 04:50.513
Me and my book. See Frasier go.

04:54.350 --> 05:00.148
Nadia, tell Mrs Crane I want to speak to
her and don't take no for an answer.

05:01.274 --> 05:07.113
Then tell her Dr Crane says
please, please, please, please...

05:11.826 --> 05:16.289
- Maris hung up on you?
- She's got Nadia doing her dirty work.

05:16.455 --> 05:19.625
Nadia is Maris's hatchet maid.

05:20.685 --> 05:23.313
What happened
to the French guy party?

05:23.479 --> 05:30.403
Disaster too. A branch of Maris' family
was slaughtered by the Huguenots.

05:32.655 --> 05:38.953
Let's forget about Maris and have
a nice meal in a convivial atmosphere.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.334
- What is she mad about?
- Beats me.

05:45.501 --> 05:48.504
Your favourite, Mr Crane.
Creamed onions.

05:48.671 --> 05:52.550
And Dr Crane, special glazed carrots
just for you.

05:52.717 --> 05:55.011
You, carve!

05:58.639 --> 06:02.101
We don't know what she's mad at
but we know who.

06:02.268 --> 06:04.979
lf anyone needs me I'll be in me room.

06:05.146 --> 06:07.982
You know where that is!

06:09.942 --> 06:13.446
- What did you do?
- I went into her bedroom.

06:13.612 --> 06:16.198
Frasier, how could you!

06:20.453 --> 06:26.584
No matter how irresistible the urge
to press your face against the door,

06:26.750 --> 06:31.505
to actually feel the grain
of the wood against your cheek,

06:31.672 --> 06:33.883
it must be fought!

06:37.261 --> 06:39.555
I went in to retrieve my book.

06:39.722 --> 06:43.851
- You're not supposed to go in there.
- What's the big deal?

06:44.018 --> 06:47.354
- She doesn't like people in there.
- I let her in my room.

06:47.521 --> 06:50.024
- Women are different.
- That's sexism.

06:50.190 --> 06:54.278
No, it's 35 years of marriage talking.
Women protect their privacy.

06:54.445 --> 06:59.158
You never go in their handbags.
It's always, "Bring me my purse."

06:59.324 --> 07:03.162
A husband is being robbed
at gunpoint and has no money.

07:03.328 --> 07:06.331
The wife still says, "Bring me my purse."

07:10.168 --> 07:15.841
Your homespun wisdom has pricked
the balloon of Frasier's pomposity.

07:17.551 --> 07:21.305
You were wrong,
so go in there and apologise. Go on.

07:21.471 --> 07:26.518
All right. I'll go into Daphne's room
and I will apologise to her.

07:28.061 --> 07:30.439
Alone, Niles!

07:37.779 --> 07:41.199
- Yes?
- Daphne, it's Dr Crane.

07:41.366 --> 07:43.410
Yes.

07:44.578 --> 07:47.330
Could you open the door, please?

07:55.797 --> 08:00.510
I behaved very insensitively
this morning and...

08:00.677 --> 08:05.432
I did need the book but it was wrong
of me to go in without your permission...

08:09.602 --> 08:11.980
...and I'm sorry.

08:17.694 --> 08:20.238
It'll never happen again.

08:21.281 --> 08:23.241
Ever.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.661
I'm being very nice.

08:29.414 --> 08:32.250
Well, good night, Daphne.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.214
Wait. I'm being much too hard on you.

08:38.381 --> 08:40.842
I'm sensitive about my privacy.

08:41.009 --> 08:44.762
No need to explain.
It will never be an issue again.

08:44.929 --> 08:47.473
Thank you for being so understanding.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.269
My problem goes back to growing up
in a house of boys.

08:51.436 --> 08:55.439
My brothers were snoops.
They gave me no peace.

08:55.606 --> 08:58.943
It was a filthy rite of passage
for the Moon boys.

08:59.110 --> 09:03.322
They'd sneak into the bathroom
and peek at me in the shower.

09:03.489 --> 09:06.200
Dear God. All eight of them?

09:06.367 --> 09:10.538
Except for my brother Billy,
the ballroom dancer.

09:13.124 --> 09:18.462
He never peeked at me. Though
he did peek at my brother Nigel.

09:26.929 --> 09:28.722
(Frasier) Coffee, Dad?
(Martin) Why not?

09:28.889 --> 09:32.685
I'm up six times a night.
I might as well be alert.

09:38.148 --> 09:41.318
Jeez, the disposal's jammed.

09:41.485 --> 09:45.322
Stick your hand down there
and see what's stuck, will you?

09:46.657 --> 09:48.701
Dad, it's me, Niles.

09:48.867 --> 09:51.161
I can't get my hand in.

09:51.328 --> 09:54.081
Punish a man for being fine-boned.

09:54.248 --> 09:57.084
- Sure it's off?
- Positive.

09:57.251 --> 09:59.920
Move away from the switch.

10:02.548 --> 10:07.427
It's wet and slimy. Like sticking
my hand into the mouth of hell.

10:07.594 --> 10:09.638
(Grinder whirs)

10:17.563 --> 10:20.274
Call me when the coffee's ready.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.569
- Sorry, Niles.
- That's enough excitement.

10:24.736 --> 10:27.906
- I'm going home to Maris.
- She's speaking to you?

10:28.073 --> 10:31.368
No but she tires
of being frosty to the help.

10:31.535 --> 10:36.289
I'm out of cash. I need something
to tip your garage attendant.

10:36.456 --> 10:39.876
Oh, great. These pills.

10:40.043 --> 10:43.588
I was thinking money
but you know him better than I do.

10:47.175 --> 10:50.303
No, no. Daphne's prescription.

10:50.470 --> 10:54.599
When I was in her room
I must have inadvertently...

10:54.766 --> 10:57.602
knocked them into my pocket.

10:57.769 --> 11:00.146
An interesting phenomenon.

11:00.313 --> 11:05.193
I can't go into a drugstore without
aspirin leaping into my trousers.

11:06.528 --> 11:10.532
OK, I was snooping around a little bit.

11:11.658 --> 11:15.954
Oh, God. "Take one before bedtime".
She'll miss these.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.791
- You off, Dr Crane?
- Yes, I am.

11:19.958 --> 11:22.710
- Say hello to your wife.
- I'll try.

11:24.129 --> 11:27.257
Mr Crane, time for your exercises.

11:27.423 --> 11:30.260
Great. I'll just
put these back in her room.

11:31.135 --> 11:33.179
Alone, Niles!

11:36.724 --> 11:40.061
The game's on. I'll exercise tomorrow.

11:40.228 --> 11:42.438
Fine. I'll be in my room.

11:48.444 --> 11:52.156
- You'll do double tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:55.952 --> 11:58.579
Grumpy old sod.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.753
(Daphne sings)

13:55.946 --> 13:59.282
What're you doing? That's disgusting!

13:59.449 --> 14:02.494
You filthy thing. Get out!

14:02.661 --> 14:04.913
Daphne, I'm so sorry!

14:14.631 --> 14:17.467
Good morning, Frasier.

14:17.634 --> 14:21.679
<i>Cara mia, un mezzo latte decaffeinato</i>
and a bran muffin.

14:21.846 --> 14:26.184
No, no... <i>due</i> bran muffins.

14:28.686 --> 14:33.483
Maris and I burned up a lot of
energy last night. A lot of energy.

14:34.526 --> 14:37.362
I have to replenish <i>ma</i> body.

14:39.572 --> 14:42.200
You achieved <i>détente</i> ?

14:42.784 --> 14:44.619
Twice.

14:46.537 --> 14:50.124
What did you say to melt
your little glacier?

14:50.291 --> 14:52.960
I stared deeply into her eyes and said,

14:53.127 --> 14:57.256
"Maris, here are the keys
to your new Mercedes."

14:58.508 --> 15:00.510
You bought her a Mercedes.

15:00.676 --> 15:04.347
Yes. The things that tiny woman
can do when motivated.

15:05.097 --> 15:09.685
lf you're done marinating in
your testosterone, I have a problem.

15:09.852 --> 15:12.688
Remember I went back
into Daphne's room?

15:12.855 --> 15:15.733
- She caught me again.
- You're joking!

15:15.900 --> 15:21.572
I was so embarrassed, I left before
she awoke. I wrote a note to explain.

15:21.739 --> 15:25.618
Considering the circumstances,
how can she forgive me?

15:25.785 --> 15:28.037
It wasn't as bad as all that.

15:28.204 --> 15:31.665
It's not like you saw her naked
or something.

15:39.715 --> 15:42.510
You did!

15:42.676 --> 15:48.224
I took no pleasure in it at all.
The entire thing was mortifying.

15:48.390 --> 15:53.354
I want to help you, so tell me
everything before you explode.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.397
No, Niles!

15:55.564 --> 15:59.151
I'll show you how I imagine her
and you tell me where I'm wrong.

15:59.318 --> 16:02.321
Stop it. Put your pen away!

16:03.364 --> 16:07.117
- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Roz, good to see you.

16:08.911 --> 16:14.416
So, Niles, you randy dog.
You got lucky last night, didn't you?

16:15.876 --> 16:17.878
I can always tell.

16:18.045 --> 16:21.089
Don't worry. You'll meet somebody.

16:22.508 --> 16:25.135
A non-fat cap, please.

16:25.302 --> 16:29.473
Roz, this was private. I'm helping
with a matter of some delicacy.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.560
Don't worry.
Shower boy told me about it.

16:33.727 --> 16:37.105
How can I make this up to Daphne?

16:37.272 --> 16:41.610
Nothing says sorry like an in-dash
CD player and a passenger airbag.

16:41.777 --> 16:45.280
Maris was upset
so he bought her a Mercedes.

16:46.448 --> 16:51.036
You're suggesting I buy my way out.
That's the coward's way out.

16:51.203 --> 16:53.914
- So I'm a coward?
- Yes.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.333
Well, I'm a coward with a hickey.

17:01.004 --> 17:05.759
Buy me a Mercedes, I'll make your
neck look like a relief map of the Andes.

17:06.885 --> 17:11.181
Don't encourage him! Bribery is
the wrong way to resolve conflicts.

17:11.348 --> 17:14.392
During which failed marriage
did you hone that theory?

17:14.559 --> 17:18.229
How dare you,
considering your non-marriage!

17:24.152 --> 17:28.031
Dr Crane, I'm glad to see you.
I need some advice.

17:28.198 --> 17:31.159
I got this son
who's a total numbnut.

17:34.078 --> 17:36.581
Hello, Dad. Love your icebreaker.

17:36.748 --> 17:40.877
Get her to stay.
She knows my moods and I like her.

17:41.044 --> 17:45.381
- She's talking about quitting?
- Yeah, so get in there and apologise.

17:45.548 --> 17:47.842
Dad, I can't go in there.

17:48.009 --> 17:51.095
No you can't, because I asked you to.

17:51.262 --> 17:56.142
I said, "Don't go," you went.
I say, "Go," you won't.

17:56.309 --> 18:00.229
Unlike Eddie, he does what I say.
Come on, Eddie.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.445
He's defying you too, Dad.

18:11.657 --> 18:16.829
Daphne, please wait.
We've got to talk. I feel terrible.

18:16.996 --> 18:21.167
Dr Crane,
your note explained everything.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.920
You've nothing to feel bad about.

18:24.086 --> 18:29.050
- That puts my mind at ease.
- We servants don't deserve privacy.

18:29.216 --> 18:33.220
Matter of fact, why don't
we get it out in the open?

18:34.513 --> 18:39.101
Here's my bank book, letters,
and my driver's licence.

18:39.268 --> 18:42.063
You see I'm 4lbs heavier now,

18:42.229 --> 18:46.484
but it's in a spot that
doesn't show...to most people!

18:47.735 --> 18:51.405
I realise it's hard
to live in someone else's home.

18:51.572 --> 18:57.369
Yes, it is. But I put up with it
because I happen to love this job.

18:57.536 --> 19:03.208
All I ever asked for was one room,
a little corner I could call my own.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.878
I never minded I was up to my eyeballs

19:06.045 --> 19:09.631
in your earth tones
and African knick-knacks.

19:09.798 --> 19:15.137
But I have to put up with you
and that's a leering love god too many!

19:15.304 --> 19:21.101
Oh, Daphne. You're right,
you do deserve a place of your own.

19:21.268 --> 19:25.230
lf you stay, I'll pay
to have your room redecorated.

19:25.397 --> 19:31.904
Just make it your own. Paint, wallpaper.
Anything so you feel comfortable.

19:32.070 --> 19:37.034
How about an electrified fence
and a German police dog?

19:38.368 --> 19:41.788
I promise as long as
we live under the same roof,

19:41.955 --> 19:45.417
I'll never set foot in your room again.

19:47.919 --> 19:49.963
- All right.
- Thank you.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.632
- I'll give it another try.
- (Doorbell)

19:53.633 --> 19:57.596
- Hello.
- Hello and goodbye, Dr Crane.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.931
- Where are you off to?
- Shopping.

20:00.098 --> 20:03.059
Your brother offered to
have my room redecorated.

20:03.226 --> 20:05.103
Really?

20:07.230 --> 20:11.860
I'm thinking of doing the whole thing
in pinks and yellows.

20:12.944 --> 20:16.531
She's really determined
to keep me out of there.

20:17.407 --> 20:22.287
So...you're putting things right
by opening your chequebook.

20:22.454 --> 20:26.541
I know what you're thinking.
It's just a gesture.

20:26.708 --> 20:32.255
I give Maris a car, it's a bribe. You
decorate Daphne's room, it's a gesture.

20:32.422 --> 20:37.677
It's different. You bought Maris off
because you are afraid of her.

20:37.844 --> 20:42.140
And you're not the slightest bit
intimidated by Daphne.

20:42.307 --> 20:46.186
So you won't be alarmed if I do this.

20:46.352 --> 20:48.396
Niles, where are you going?

20:49.564 --> 20:53.151
- My foot's in Daphne's room.
- Get out.

20:53.318 --> 20:56.029
Afraid you'll get in...trouble?

20:57.071 --> 20:59.574
- Now we're safe.
- Stop it!

20:59.741 --> 21:02.577
Trouble...safe...trouble...safe.

21:02.744 --> 21:05.121
Niles, you're acting like a child.

21:05.288 --> 21:09.834
- Trouble, safe, trouble, safe...
- See what you've done.

21:10.001 --> 21:14.297
Oh, well, so you'll just write her
a bigger, fatter cheque.

21:14.464 --> 21:16.257
No, Niles, she'll quit!

21:16.424 --> 21:19.677
- What! Why didn't you say?
- Oh, you spilled...

21:21.888 --> 21:26.309
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's Niles's fault.

21:55.337 --> 22:00.134
Daphne, did you see that sporty
little sub-compact over there?

22:03.178 --> 22:07.349
Is that a Mercedes dealership
across the street?

22:16.483 --> 22:22.114
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:22.281 --> 22:23.449
# Quite stylish!

22:23.615 --> 22:30.581
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:30.747 --> 22:36.420
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:36.587 --> 22:39.089
# They're calling again #

22:39.256 --> 22:42.217
Good night everybody!

22:43.305 --> 22:49.380
