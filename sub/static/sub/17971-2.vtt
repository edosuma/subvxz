(chuckles)

00:34.267 --> 00:35.267
Morning, everybody.

00:35.269 --> 00:39.338
Last night I had the strangest,
most wonderful dream,

00:39.340 --> 00:41.173
that I had
a beautiful new wife

00:41.175 --> 00:44.176
and that Cleveland Jr.
had a beautiful sister

00:44.178 --> 00:47.646
and a really cool rascal
of a little brother.

00:47.648 --> 00:51.150
Oh, dreams
really do come true!

00:51.152 --> 00:51.683
(laughing)

00:51.685 --> 00:53.819
(laughing)
Daddy, you are so hilarious.

00:53.821 --> 00:57.489
I had a dream there wasn't a
couple of freeloading chumps

00:57.491 --> 00:59.858
in my kitchen.
Slide, sister.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.827
I'm out.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.696
Shoot, man.
(muttering)

01:04.698 --> 01:07.366
Damn fa-fool
come and tell me

01:07.368 --> 01:10.169
about some stupid
dream, man.

01:10.171 --> 01:10.669
Uh-huh.

01:10.671 --> 01:16.241
I spy with my little eye
something... yellow.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.576
Mmm. My shirt.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.678
You're good
at this game, Daddy.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.447
Stop the car right now!

01:21.449 --> 01:23.482
I don't want
to be seen with you!

01:23.484 --> 01:24.349
Oh, okay.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.819
CLEVELAND:
Cleveland, don't smack her.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.887
Okay, I'll stop the car.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.656
(brakes squeal)

01:30.658 --> 01:32.224
You go, girl!

01:32.226 --> 01:33.559
To class! Ha-ha!

01:33.561 --> 01:36.795
Don't you want to get out of
the car, too, Cleveland Jr.?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.530
No. If I walk that far,

01:38.532 --> 01:41.800
I'm gonna get sweat spots
under my breasts.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.305
(brakes squeal)

01:47.474 --> 01:50.209
All right, now.
You have a good day.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.244
Okay. Bye, Dad.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.147
Hey, why don't you make out
with your dad again?

01:55.149 --> 01:55.881
Yeah, get a room.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.717
Yeah! Why don't you choke
on your dad's corn dog?

01:58.719 --> 02:01.687
Whoa, Derek, that was
an unnecessary escalation.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.488
Yeah, but you said...

02:02.490 --> 02:05.124
No, I know what I said.
That was still way too much.

02:05.126 --> 02:09.328
We need another girl, so I'm
gonna arbitrarily pick someone.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.563
Okay, the new fat kid
will be a girl

02:11.565 --> 02:12.764
and will be
on the girls' team.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.800
And, uh, also,
I'll call you Beth.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.268
(blows whistle)

02:16.270 --> 02:17.436
Okay, dodgeball!

02:17.438 --> 02:18.904
Beth, you're out.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.340
(laughing)

02:22.742 --> 02:26.245
So, how was your first day
of school, Cleveland Jr.?

02:26.247 --> 02:26.979
Terrible.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.715
Worse than an ABC comedy.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.583
Oh, I don't ever
watch that mess.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.818
Listen, when I was
in high school,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.287
I discovered that I
was good at baseball.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.556
You'll just have to find
what you're good at.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.391
I'm good
at making sandwiches.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.893
Well, this is
not a criticism,

02:40.895 --> 02:44.296
but maybe you could toast
the bread once in a while.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.798
The point is, right now
you don't know what it is

02:46.800 --> 02:48.667
that's going to make
you fit in at school.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.670
But you just be on the lookout,
'cause it'll find you.

02:51.672 --> 02:55.307
Thanks, Daddy. I'm a little
less scared of school now.

02:55.309 --> 02:58.777
But I'm still afraid
of toasters.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.748
That's my toast.
I'm sorry.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.616
You heard me!

03:04.618 --> 03:06.752
Mmm.
(munching)

03:06.754 --> 03:10.289
Now you can put
your fingers inside me.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.291
So, Rallo, how was your day?

03:12.293 --> 03:14.426
I pooped my pants
at recess.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.827
We all have accidents.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.996
Oh, it wasn't
no accident.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.398
All right.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.433
So, Roberta,
how was your day?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.368
This ain't <i>The View.</i>

03:25.305 --> 03:27.673
She'll be okay, baby.
She's just upset

03:27.675 --> 03:29.875
because the Daddy-Daughter
Dinner Dance is coming up.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.645
Robert promised to take her
last year, but he never showed.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.614
Oh, well, why
don't I take her?

03:35.616 --> 03:36.815
I'm her stepdaddy.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.849
It'll be fun.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.919
Don't worry.
I won't try anything.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.287
Oh, I don't know.

03:42.289 --> 03:45.390
Why don't you wait and see
if Roberta brings it up to you?

03:45.392 --> 03:46.825
Isn't that what you
told Cleveland Jr.,

03:46.827 --> 03:49.361
to wait for the opportunity
to present itself?

03:49.363 --> 03:52.297
Honestly, I have no idea
what I told that boy.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.833
I just try
to get him through the days.

03:54.835 --> 03:59.238
I pray to the Lord
he finds his way.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.009
Roberta, congratulations
on getting a date

04:04.011 --> 04:06.011
to the Daddy-Daughter
Dinner Dance!

04:06.013 --> 04:07.579
I don't have a date.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.669
I'm not going
to that dance

05:03.671 --> 05:07.439
so you can stop
with all the musical numbers.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.674
Daddy, I'm ready.

Yeah.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.585
I'm Mandy.
What's your name?

05:20.587 --> 05:24.756
Cleveland Jr., but most people
around here call me Beth.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.925
Well, you better not
cross me, Fat Beth,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.827
or I'm going to beat you
like a three-legged mule!

05:28.829 --> 05:31.363
Well, how will I know
when I'm crossing you?

'Cause I'll do this!

05:33.000 --> 05:34.366
But... But... But...

But, but, but, but...

05:36.970 --> 05:38.970
(panting)

05:38.972 --> 05:42.140
Damn. When are they going
to get doors on these stalls?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.609
Don't worry.
I won't peek.

05:45.578 --> 05:46.812
Hey, fridge!

05:46.814 --> 05:49.848
Step over here
and block the view.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.817
The other way.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.486
Hey, you're perfect
for this.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.420
I'm Lane.

05:55.422 --> 05:56.788
That's a beautiful name.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.890
I'm Cleveland Brown, Jr.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.426
(toilet flushing)

06:03.129 --> 06:03.762
Hey, Kyle!

06:03.764 --> 06:06.832
If you need to rip a grumpy,
this guy makes a great door.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.801
That's cool.
I'm just here to take a leak.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.843
How was school,
Cleveland Jr.?

06:17.845 --> 06:20.212
Crappy.
And I mean that in a good way.

06:20.214 --> 06:24.015
Hmm. You are one
curious young individual.

06:24.017 --> 06:24.716
Hey, Roberta.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.119
I know you're on the fence
about going to the dance,

06:27.121 --> 06:31.857
but I thought maybe
this would help you decide.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.859
Oh, my God!

06:33.861 --> 06:34.926
Are these real?!

06:34.928 --> 06:37.729
Hell, no!
Just come to the dance.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.998
Haven't even gotten
your mama a diamond yet.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.733
How's that job hunt coming?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.802
Why don't you shut the hell up?

06:43.804 --> 06:47.839
These earrings were a very
nice gesture, Cleveland.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.744
Okay. I'll go
to the dance with you.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.780
Hooray!
We got to celebrate.

06:54.782 --> 06:58.150
Who wants a Baskin Robbins
ice cream cake?

06:58.152 --> 06:58.850

06:58.852 --> 07:04.656
Oh, Donna, I haven't been this
excited since I won that Oscar!

07:04.658 --> 07:06.625
Oh, my God!

07:06.627 --> 07:08.760
(sobbing)

07:10.163 --> 07:12.063
I'm sorry.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.666
This moment...
(panting)

07:14.668 --> 07:17.202
is so much bigger than me!

07:17.204 --> 07:19.771
(Cleveland sobbing)

07:19.773 --> 07:22.841
This moment is for every

07:22.843 --> 07:25.610
nameless,
faceless woman of color

07:25.612 --> 07:26.945
that has now got a chance

07:26.947 --> 07:31.583
because this door tonight
has been opened.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.652
(Cleveland sobbing)

07:33.953 --> 07:38.123
I'm so honored and thank
the Academy for choosing me

07:38.125 --> 07:44.529
to be the vessel from
which this blessing might flow!

07:47.066 --> 07:48.800
Okay, wait a minute.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.001
I gotta take this.

07:50.003 --> 07:54.739
(panting)
74 years here!

07:58.544 --> 08:02.714
Hey, new stepdaddy,
you are doing a great job!

08:02.716 --> 08:04.749
Now, go get that cake!

08:06.219 --> 08:07.752
(squeaking)

08:08.788 --> 08:09.821
(squishing)

08:09.823 --> 08:11.556
(squeaking)

08:13.526 --> 08:14.826
What the...?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.662
I'm so sorry, Meadowlark Lemon.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.598
Why'd you kill
the dog?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.199
Wouldn't stop barking, huh?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.535
No, Lester,
it was an accident.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.170
Oh, we gotta keep this
a secret

08:25.172 --> 08:27.906
or the kids will hate me
forever.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.843
Since there's no sign
of sexual abuse,

08:31.845 --> 08:34.746
I'll go ahead
and get rid of it for you.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.014
Since there's no sign
of sexual abuse.

08:36.016 --> 08:41.186
Kendra, hope you're in the mood
for Chinese food!

08:41.188 --> 08:43.555
You read my stomach!

08:47.894 --> 08:49.194
<i>Be cool, Cleveland.</i>

08:49.196 --> 08:51.263
<i>Act as if nothing</i>
<i>has happened,</i>

08:51.265 --> 08:53.932
<i>and the others</i>
<i>will follow suit.</i>

08:53.934 --> 08:54.966
(Rallo screams)

08:54.968 --> 08:57.168
Meadowlark Lemon
never came back last night!

08:57.170 --> 08:59.004
I woke up
and he's not in his bed!

08:59.006 --> 09:00.105
We gotta go look for him!

09:00.107 --> 09:02.107
What I think we need to do

09:02.109 --> 09:04.910
is hope against hope
that he'll come back.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.580
But let's remember
that dogs are wild animals

09:08.582 --> 09:12.851
and have only been domesticated
since, like, 7000 B.C.

09:12.853 --> 09:13.885
or somethin'.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.554
(barking)

09:15.556 --> 09:16.922
Sit.

09:16.924 --> 09:17.889
What did he say?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.391
I think he wants us to sit.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.092
Should we?
I don't know.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.227
You know what?
Let's do it,

09:22.229 --> 09:23.628
and then I bet
I can trick him

09:23.630 --> 09:25.297
into scooping up
my <i>poop.</i>

09:25.299 --> 09:27.632
Oh, that would be classic!

09:29.068 --> 09:31.136
(snickering)

09:31.138 --> 09:32.871
You'd better go help him
find the dog.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.940
I'll go shopping
with Roberta.
Okay.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.808
Here, take
my credit card.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.945
I might have to get myself
a new suit as well

09:39.947 --> 09:41.346
at the Men's Wearhouse.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.215
I'm gonna like the way I look.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.084
I guarantee it.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.457
Meadowlark Lemon!

09:52.459 --> 09:53.825
Meadowlark Lemon!

09:53.827 --> 09:55.860
Meadowlark Lemon!

09:55.862 --> 09:56.928
I don't think he's here.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.363
If we don't find him,

09:58.365 --> 10:00.699
I'm gonna start using
drugs, probably.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.299
Hmm, probably.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.868
You know, Rallo, as hard
as this is for me to say,

10:03.870 --> 10:06.671
we might need to start
thinking about the possibility

10:06.673 --> 10:10.275
that Meadowlark Lemon
has gone to a better place.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.210
Or he could be
at the sludge pond!

10:12.212 --> 10:13.845
He loves that place.
Let's look there.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.246
The sludge pond?
I don't think he...

10:15.248 --> 10:17.782
You know something?
I'm not gonna lie to you.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.985
When Mama told me
she was marrying you,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.753
I said, "Really? This fat guy?"

10:21.755 --> 10:24.389
This is how little
you think of yourself?

10:24.391 --> 10:28.026
But the Cleveland Brown
I've seen in the past few hours?

10:28.028 --> 10:30.662
It's making me think
looks aren't everything.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.063
You're all right, Old Brown.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.833
(voice breaking):
Because you're helping
this man

10:34.835 --> 10:38.003
at a time in his life
when he... when he...

10:38.005 --> 10:40.872
(sighs) Okay,
we'll look at the sludge pond.

10:40.874 --> 10:44.376
Go ahead and blow your nose
on my shirt if you need to.

10:44.378 --> 10:45.910
(blowing nose wetly)

10:45.912 --> 10:46.878
Oh!

10:46.880 --> 10:49.714
Ah, ah...

10:49.716 --> 10:51.216
(blowing nose wetly)

10:51.218 --> 10:52.651
(groans)

10:54.153 --> 10:56.888
(gasping)

10:56.890 --> 10:57.422
Nothing.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.325
Well, not nothing,
but no dog.

11:00.327 --> 11:04.195
Well, not no dog,
but no Meadowlark Lemon.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.831
Well, then it's off
to the slurry chute

11:06.833 --> 11:09.968
behind the chicken gizzard
cannery!

11:09.970 --> 11:11.703
Son of a...

11:13.305 --> 11:14.406
...bitch.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.444
He's not here either.

11:19.446 --> 11:23.415
Ugh, this place smells
like Chloe Sevigny.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.082
Who's that?

11:24.084 --> 11:26.951
Just some gross,
indie porno actress.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.053
Where next?

11:28.055 --> 11:30.889
The Greek
restaurant/gym.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.358
(both retching)

11:40.032 --> 11:42.100
So then, Miss Donna said yes,

11:42.102 --> 11:45.036
and now we live next door
to a bear.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.071
(toilet flushes)

11:46.073 --> 11:46.538
Wow, great story.

11:46.540 --> 11:50.241
Hey, be my buddy and grab me
a couple of paper towels.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.910
Be your buddy?!

11:51.912 --> 11:52.911
Sure!

11:53.079 --> 11:55.447
Thanks. Hey, I heard
you got beat up

11:55.449 --> 11:56.848
by that girl
yesterday.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.348
Yeah.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.917
You want me
to kick her ass?
No.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.019
Want me to ask her out, date her
for, like, eight months,

12:01.021 --> 12:01.986
get her to fall
in love with me,

12:01.988 --> 12:03.488
and then dump her
and break her heart?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.757
Sure. Just don't get her
pregnant.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.125
How could I?
I had a vasectomy.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.762
Well, not a vasectomy so much
as testicular cancer.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.297
That's nature's vasectomy.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.366
Thanks, I never
thought of it that way.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.434
Gimme some.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.203
You're all right.

12:20.372 --> 12:23.341
So all day
I was searching for a dog

12:23.343 --> 12:24.542
that I know is dead.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.945
I don't know what
to tell these kids.

12:26.947 --> 12:30.215
Hey, if it'd help,
tell 'em it was delicious.

12:30.217 --> 12:30.982
What?!

12:30.984 --> 12:32.484
Tasted a lot
like kitten.

12:32.486 --> 12:33.852
You ate the dog?!

12:33.854 --> 12:34.986
I ate a dog once.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.121
I think her name was Betsy.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.922
Met her tailgating.
Arena football.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.390
Season tickets.
She had bacne.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.026
Woke up, she was peeing
in the corner in my room.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.028
Was she Chinese or Asian?

12:44.030 --> 12:45.230
Partly.
You know what?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.765
She might have
been Hawaiian.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.398
Excuse me!
Hello?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.268
We're talking about Lester
eating my family's dog.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.804
Wait. Who are you to judge,
Cleveland?

12:52.806 --> 12:54.405
At least Lester didn't murder
the dog

12:54.407 --> 12:56.441
and then lie
to his family about it.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.275
It wasn't a murder.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.411
Well, you're-you're covering it
up like it's murder.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.146
Tell me, Cleveland,

13:01.148 --> 13:03.548
are you going to build
your family foundation

13:03.550 --> 13:05.517
on a rock or on the quicksand?

13:05.519 --> 13:06.818
Rock.
Frickin' A,
rock!

13:06.820 --> 13:10.855
Well, then Jesus would say
you have to confess everything.

13:10.857 --> 13:11.556
Be brutally honest.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.124
Don't leave out any details.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.960
You may not know,
but Jesus was a carpenter.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.595
Back then it was a better job,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.898
and good carpentry is
all about details.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.901
But I just broke through
with these kids.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.170
If you don't come clean,
you'll regret it.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.906
You know, like Lewis regretted
bringing Clark

13:27.908 --> 13:28.840
on that expedition.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.074
So we pull up our canoe,

13:30.076 --> 13:31.643
and there are, like,
400 Indians

13:31.645 --> 13:33.077
with arrows aimed
right at us.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.379
I'm starting
to freak a little...

13:34.381 --> 13:36.514
Uh, actually, it was
probably closer to 300.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.415
Okay,
thanks, Clark.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.517
So I say,
"We come in peace!"

13:39.519 --> 13:40.552
Well, um, no offense,

13:40.554 --> 13:43.321
but it was actually
Sacagawea who said that.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.022
For what it's worth.

13:44.024 --> 13:47.325
Right. Well, luckily we brought
plenty of beaver furs.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.059
Pelts.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.895
Do you want to tell
the (bleep) story, Clark?!

13:51.564 --> 13:54.999
Look at your date for
tomorrow night, Cleveland.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.100
Isn't she beautiful?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.468
Thank you for the dress,
Cleveland.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.071
I'm glad you're all here.
Please sit down.

14:00.073 --> 14:03.074
I'm not sure how
to tell y'all this,

14:03.076 --> 14:03.975
so I'm just gonna
say it:

14:03.977 --> 14:07.612
The other night,
Meadowlark Lemon was killed.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.313
What?!

14:08.315 --> 14:09.981
Oh, my God!
What happened?

14:09.983 --> 14:13.151
Well, as I was backing out
of the driveway

14:13.153 --> 14:15.587
to get the Baskin Robbins
ice cream cake,

14:15.589 --> 14:18.389
which we all later enjoyed
very much,

14:18.391 --> 14:24.028
I accidentally drove over his
head with both my left rear tire

14:24.030 --> 14:26.164
and then my left front tire.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.900
Curious, I stepped out
of my vehicle

14:28.902 --> 14:32.136
and saw his mangled,
lifeless body on the driveway

14:32.138 --> 14:35.440
in a smeared pool
of his own blood.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.476
(groans)
And now the hard part:

14:38.478 --> 14:41.579
I had no idea that in the hours
that followed,

14:41.581 --> 14:46.084
Lester and his family
would eat Meadowlark Lemon.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.353
That's right.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.988
They ate your dog.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.958
Okay. So, Rallo,
go throw the dog food out.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.059
We have no use for it now.

14:55.061 --> 14:59.931
That will make room for a new
recycling bin in the kitchen!

14:59.933 --> 15:00.465
Hooray!

15:00.467 --> 15:03.968
Hooray for
the Browns and Tubbses!

15:03.970 --> 15:07.005
You're nothing but
a lowdown dog killer.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.641
I knew I couldn't trust you.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.445
Why didn't you just tell
us the truth before?

15:14.447 --> 15:18.049
I don't know.
I just took the easy way out.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.150
Like Kurt Cobain.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.020
Make love to me, Kurt.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.389
(breaking wind)

15:25.658 --> 15:27.225
Um...

15:27.227 --> 15:30.261
I'm going to go grab
something out of the garage.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.630
Be right back, though.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.032
Roberta,
I hope this doesn't mean

15:34.034 --> 15:36.567
you're not going to the
Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.636
Oh, yeah. I'm
going to the dance.

15:38.638 --> 15:39.671
Oh, good.

15:39.673 --> 15:40.438
But not with you.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.475
You'd probably run me over and
feed me to a bunch of rednecks.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.144
I just called my real dad.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.346
I'm going with him!

15:48.348 --> 15:49.447
Oh, Cleveland.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.550
I know. Let's go upstairs
and pay tribute

15:52.552 --> 15:55.687
to Meadowlark Lemon
by making love in the style

15:55.689 --> 15:57.288
coined by his species.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.625
Plus, that way,
we can both watch <i>Kimmel.</i>

16:05.431 --> 16:07.498
Kids! Donna!
Come out here!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.434
I got a surprise for you!

16:10.035 --> 16:12.203
Cleveland, what have you done?

16:12.205 --> 16:15.573
I'd like to introduce
you all to our new dog,

16:15.575 --> 16:17.375
Kareem Abdul Jabark.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.310
(laughs)
Get it, "Jabark"?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.412
You can't just replace my dog

16:21.414 --> 16:23.614
like Brad Pitt replaced
Jennifer Aniston,

16:23.616 --> 16:26.217
or John Mayer replaced
Jennifer Aniston,

16:26.219 --> 16:28.720
or Vince Vaughn replaced
Jennifer Aniston,

16:28.722 --> 16:31.656
or that munch from
The Counting Crows replaced...

16:31.658 --> 16:36.627
The point is, my dog is
not Jennifer Aniston.

16:37.363 --> 16:41.299
Well, I guess it's just you
and me, Kareem Abdul Jabark.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.868
Now go fetch the rebound!

16:45.704 --> 16:46.938
(growling)

16:46.940 --> 16:47.739
Oh!

16:47.741 --> 16:49.407
(gunshot)

16:49.409 --> 16:50.608
Oh!

16:50.610 --> 16:52.977
Run! Run!

16:55.581 --> 16:56.714
(car horn beeps)

16:56.716 --> 16:59.217
My friends are here.
I'm leaving.

16:59.219 --> 16:59.817
Your friends?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.185
I thought Robert
was picking you up.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.121
He had a last-minute
appointment.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.288
He'll meet me there.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.757
He's not showing
up, is he?

17:05.759 --> 17:08.126
Whenever he has
a "last-minute appointment,"

17:08.128 --> 17:11.062
it means he's going
to get a new bag of weed.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.364
It's usually
pretty good weed.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.633
Oh, I don't know
what to do.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.734
This is harder than trying

17:16.736 --> 17:19.670
to identify a rapist
at a <i>Star Trek </i> convention.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.139
Could you describe
the assailant?

17:21.141 --> 17:25.543
Yes.
He was a white male,
35 to 45 years old,

17:25.545 --> 17:27.111
glasses, bad skin,

17:27.113 --> 17:28.780
about 50 pounds
overweight,

17:28.782 --> 17:29.580
smelled like Cheetos

17:29.582 --> 17:32.116
and was carrying a poster
with a Sharpie pen.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.251
I know what to do.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.687
Who here is not a virgin?

17:36.689 --> 17:37.855
You're under arrest.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.090
(game buzzes)

17:39.092 --> 17:40.858
Aw!

17:40.860 --> 17:41.659
(buzzes)

17:41.661 --> 17:44.095
Aw! I'm no good at anything.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.430
Look at you.
Pitiful.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.398
You're nothin',
Cleveland Brown.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.399
You're a loser.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.468
And your mustache
is stupid.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.169
You know, Rallo,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.838
you're really cruising
for some discipline.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.541
All right, that's it.
Here we go.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.242
I'm gonna enjoy this.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.577
All right, enough!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.712
Look, Rallo,
I made a mistake.

18:01.714 --> 18:05.083
I feel terrible for
running over your dog.

18:05.085 --> 18:05.850
You should!

18:05.852 --> 18:08.753
I'd bring him back
if I could, but I can't.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.957
What's done is done.
And we are moving on.

18:12.959 --> 18:13.658
You got that?!

18:13.660 --> 18:15.927
I'm in charge
of this family now,

18:15.929 --> 18:18.429
and you are gonna
respect me!

18:18.431 --> 18:22.733
Well, look who
finally showed up: a man.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.502
'Bout time
you took charge.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.570
You're lucky, too.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.638
I'm gonna put
these away...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.606
for now.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.607
So, we good?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.043
Yeah, we good.
Now as for my sister,

18:32.045 --> 18:35.113
I think we both know
what you gotta do.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.582
You bet we do.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.516
Uh...

18:38.518 --> 18:39.183
She just went

18:39.185 --> 18:41.552
to the Daddy-Daughter Dinner
Dance by herself?

18:41.554 --> 18:42.386
Yep.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.622
(tires screech)

18:46.692 --> 18:48.659
What the hell?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.361
Here you are,
Mr. Williams.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.130
(chuckles)
Thank you, young man.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.833
Lookin' sharp there,
Mr. Williams, sir.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.904
Oh, hi, Dad!
What are you doing here?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.639

What are you doing here?

19:01.641 --> 19:05.743
Working. Remember, you told me
to find something I'm good at?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.246
Well, I did!
I'm good at mouth breathing.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.580
Which makes it bearable for me

19:09.582 --> 19:12.917
to stand in here all day
and make money and friends.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.919
All thanks to your advice.

and you listen good!

19:18.892 --> 19:20.892
Just spray a little
in the air

19:20.894 --> 19:22.527

Okay, Dad.

boil your clothes!

20:06.339 --> 20:08.539

to forgive you,

20:08.541 --> 20:11.542

what families do.
