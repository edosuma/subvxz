00:29.675 --> 00:31.233
Get up, girl. Get up!

00:42.115 --> 00:43.230
Whoa!

01:00.275 --> 01:01.424
Little Josey!

01:04.155 --> 01:06.066
Come on in. Let's get you cleaned up.

01:10.435 --> 01:11.550
Better go.

02:26.515 --> 02:27.914
Josey!

02:37.115 --> 02:38.594
Pa!

04:09.795 --> 04:11.786
Ashes to ashes...

04:14.195 --> 04:15.867
...dust to dust...

04:17.714 --> 04:19.512
...the Lord gives...

04:21.635 --> 04:23.432
...the Lord takes away.

06:19.635 --> 06:21.432
The name's Anderson.

06:23.715 --> 06:26.183
Bloody Bill is what they call me.

06:30.635 --> 06:31.590
Redlegs?

06:34.915 --> 06:36.667
You'll find them up in Kansas.

06:38.115 --> 06:39.673
They're with the Union.

06:41.555 --> 06:43.785
And we're going up there
and set things aright.

06:48.875 --> 06:49.990
I'll come with you.

10:21.875 --> 10:23.831
All that a fellow has to do...

10:24.635 --> 10:27.513
...is ride into that Union camp
down there...

10:28.715 --> 10:33.072
...raise his right hand and swear you'll
be loyal to the United States.

10:34.395 --> 10:36.750
Then he can take up his horse again...

10:37.435 --> 10:39.073
...and go home.

10:43.595 --> 10:45.472
They'll give us full amnesty then?

10:47.035 --> 10:48.070
Yep.

10:49.435 --> 10:51.665
Everyone else has done it but us.

10:54.115 --> 10:55.833
We're the last holdouts.

11:07.435 --> 11:09.027
I'm going in. I've had enough.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.025
Better go with them, boy.

12:24.435 --> 12:25.584
You coming with us?

12:29.275 --> 12:30.674
I reckon not, Fletcher.

12:31.275 --> 12:32.674
They'll be coming after you.

12:34.835 --> 12:35.790
Yep.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.706
There's nowhere to go to get away.

12:41.915 --> 12:43.394
I reckon that's true.

12:47.875 --> 12:48.671
Good luck.

14:17.555 --> 14:19.352
Put the rifle down too.

14:20.475 --> 14:23.228
- I'll need it for squirrels and such.
- Put it down.

14:28.755 --> 14:32.225
Kind of young, ain't you kid, to be
riding with this rabble?

14:32.635 --> 14:36.389
Who you calling rabble,
you blue scumbelly?

14:38.595 --> 14:41.871
Hell, we showed these boys, anyway.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.549
Lee might have had to surrender,
but we didn't.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.433
- Shut up, kid.
- Yes, sir.

14:46.675 --> 14:48.108
You showed us.

14:48.435 --> 14:49.754
Now get in line...

14:49.995 --> 14:52.793
...before I kick you so hard you'll
wear your ass for a hat.

15:02.995 --> 15:04.872
Here's the man you asked for, sir.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.949
- Fletcher. Good to see you.
- Senator.

15:08.195 --> 15:09.184
Well done.

15:09.435 --> 15:10.470
Thank you.

15:14.315 --> 15:16.829
What the hell is this Redleg doing here?

15:19.275 --> 15:21.914
You said regular federal authorities
would handle this.

15:22.715 --> 15:26.310
Captain Terrill is the
regular federal authority now.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.985
Captain Terrill is
a bloodthirsty son of a bitch!

15:30.235 --> 15:32.385
He is a looter and a pillager!

15:32.635 --> 15:34.273
He's those men's worst enemy!

15:36.475 --> 15:37.988
The war's over.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.230
Our side won the war.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.788
Now we must busy ourselves
winning the peace.

15:45.035 --> 15:49.586
And Fletcher, there's an old saying:
To the victors belong the spoils.

15:56.715 --> 15:59.070
And there's another old saying, Senator.

15:59.475 --> 16:02.228
Don't piss down my back and
tell me it's raining.

16:03.155 --> 16:05.510
Which side is this man on, Senator?

16:05.755 --> 16:07.825
Easy. He brought them in, didn't he?

16:08.075 --> 16:09.793
- All but one.
- Who's that?

16:10.715 --> 16:11.704
Josey Wales.

16:14.315 --> 16:15.987
Josey Wales.

16:22.115 --> 16:26.028
Captain Terrill, I want you to
currycomb the countryside.

16:26.475 --> 16:29.433
You beat the brush and root out
everything disloyal...

16:29.755 --> 16:32.906
...from a Shanghai rooster to
a Durham cow!

16:33.155 --> 16:36.033
We've got to clean up this country.

16:36.595 --> 16:41.305
Now you take 5 men and go up there
and get Josey Wales.

16:43.275 --> 16:48.030
Captain Redlegs Terrill and 5 men
against Josey Wales?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.985
We stopped those bushwhackers
pretty good during the war.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.667
You go with Captain Terrill.

16:58.395 --> 17:01.114
Bring in this damn
insurrectionist rebel.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.911
Here's the money for bringing
the others...

17:06.155 --> 17:08.623
...and there'll be more
for Josey Wales.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.151
I've had enough of your money, Senator.

17:17.795 --> 17:19.353
Let Wales be.

17:19.595 --> 17:21.028
Let me be.

17:22.115 --> 17:23.594
I'm finished with you.

17:34.315 --> 17:35.430
All right...

17:36.715 --> 17:40.913
...I want you men to raise
your right hands.

17:41.155 --> 17:42.349
What for?

17:42.995 --> 17:45.907
So you can pledge loyalty
to the Union.

17:46.355 --> 17:48.744
Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?

17:48.995 --> 17:51.350
You ought to have us turn around
and bend over.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.827
All raise your right hands so
I can take your oath.

17:58.595 --> 17:59.550
I pledge...

17:59.795 --> 18:03.310
...that I will be loyal to
the United States of America.

18:03.555 --> 18:06.069
I pledge that I will be loyal...

18:06.315 --> 18:08.875
...to the United States of America.

18:09.995 --> 18:11.394
That I will...

18:12.875 --> 18:15.594
Let's see. I will abide by its law...

18:15.835 --> 18:17.666
...that I will never bear arms
against it...

18:17.915 --> 18:19.871
I will abide by its law...

18:20.115 --> 18:23.425
...that I will never bear arms
against it.

18:25.435 --> 18:26.709
...and recognize...

18:28.115 --> 18:29.434
...that it is one nation.

18:30.555 --> 18:31.670
And recognize...

18:31.955 --> 18:33.229
...that it is one nation.

18:33.475 --> 18:35.147
- I ain't doing it.
- Come on, kid.

18:35.395 --> 18:37.465
Let's get this over with, damn it!

18:37.755 --> 18:39.234
But I been thinking.

18:40.195 --> 18:42.265
I think it's them who owes
an apology.

18:43.315 --> 18:45.465
And I further swear, that though...

18:45.715 --> 18:46.704
...I be murderous...

18:49.235 --> 18:50.827
Look! That's Josey!

18:55.555 --> 18:58.547
Verminous, lying, Missouri scum!

19:30.075 --> 19:31.633
Damn you, Senator!

19:32.035 --> 19:35.345
You promised me those men would be
decently treated.

19:35.595 --> 19:37.711
They were decently treated.

19:37.995 --> 19:39.951
They were decently fed...

19:40.195 --> 19:42.186
...and then they were decently shot.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.234
These men are common outlaws,
nothing more.

20:44.795 --> 20:47.070
Run for it, Fletcher, it's a trap!

21:02.635 --> 21:04.910
Josey, we best be on our way.

21:05.595 --> 21:07.631
- Get moving, boy.
- They're coming after us.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.627
We've got to take to the brush!

21:09.875 --> 21:10.751
You get going!

21:10.995 --> 21:12.030
You can't get them all.

21:12.275 --> 21:13.230
That's a fact.

21:13.475 --> 21:14.703
Why you doing it then?

21:16.555 --> 21:18.113
I've got nothing better to do.

21:18.355 --> 21:20.744
Fletcher was in with them.
It was a trap!

21:21.755 --> 21:22.551
Fletcher?

21:23.875 --> 21:25.593
Never would have figured that.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.026
You dumb kid.

21:34.755 --> 21:36.552
I've got to tell you something.

21:37.555 --> 21:39.113
I'm scared of dying.

21:39.835 --> 21:41.029
Move out!

22:11.555 --> 22:13.750
You are going after him, after all.

22:14.355 --> 22:16.630
Fletcher, I'm giving you a commission.

22:17.515 --> 22:20.791
Hound this Wales to kingdom come.

22:22.275 --> 22:23.833
Hound him, Senator?

22:24.795 --> 22:27.628
A man like Wales lives by the feud.

22:28.995 --> 22:31.987
Because of what you did here today,
I've got to kill him.

22:33.355 --> 22:35.664
He'll have to run for it now.

22:36.475 --> 22:39.069
And hell is where he's headed.

22:40.195 --> 22:42.390
He'll be waiting there for us, Senator.

22:47.595 --> 22:49.745
Don't hold back on account of me.
I can ride.

22:49.995 --> 22:53.749
I ain't holding back on account of you,
you thick-headed grasshopper.

22:54.115 --> 22:58.347
If we ride in the open, there's enough
posses over in South Missouri...

22:58.595 --> 23:00.506
...to start another war.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.435
And if we try riding
instead of thinking...

23:05.315 --> 23:07.704
...we'll end up hanging by a rope
by nightfall.

23:08.835 --> 23:09.950
Where are we headed?

23:10.195 --> 23:11.105
The Indian Nations.

23:11.355 --> 23:14.506
It's a good place to hole up
and get you healed up.

23:14.755 --> 23:16.108
Then we'll go get Fletcher?

23:18.115 --> 23:19.389
Right, boy.

23:19.915 --> 23:22.224
Then we go back and get Fletcher.

23:32.915 --> 23:35.270
There's some riders coming up behind us.

24:07.435 --> 24:09.630
Get down here, boy.
Lay across his neck.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.433
Keep him down there.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.670
Can you hear me?

24:28.595 --> 24:32.304
Now if you see me get up,
you stay there, understand?

24:32.555 --> 24:34.591
If you hear shooting and
me headed back north...

24:34.835 --> 24:37.269
...get back on that horse.
He'll get up with you...

24:37.515 --> 24:39.506
...and you head south, now you hear?

24:56.275 --> 24:58.027
You can let him up now, boy.

24:59.235 --> 25:00.554
Let him up!

25:01.715 --> 25:03.148
Get up, goddamn it!

25:07.675 --> 25:09.631
Whupped them again, didn't we?

25:11.995 --> 25:13.474
Whupped them again, boy.

25:24.635 --> 25:28.025
Ten years I've been ferrying
Kansas Redlegs...

25:28.275 --> 25:31.347
...Union Cavalry, Missouri guerrillas...

25:31.595 --> 25:33.153
...you name it!

25:33.395 --> 25:35.272
Mad dogs, them guerrillas!

25:35.515 --> 25:37.631
You look sideways at them...

25:37.915 --> 25:39.428
...they kill you!

25:40.355 --> 25:42.027
Hard men to do business with.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.549
You bet!

25:43.835 --> 25:45.666
You know, in my line of work...

25:45.915 --> 25:49.225
...you got to be able either to sing
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"...

25:49.475 --> 25:52.387
...or "Dixie" with equal enthusiasm...

25:52.795 --> 25:55.229
...depending upon present company.

25:55.835 --> 25:58.633
Can't say as I blame you for that.

25:58.915 --> 26:01.713
Only good business to play it safe.

26:01.955 --> 26:04.674
Thank God they all been disarmed now...

26:04.875 --> 26:07.025
...except for a few of the
nastiest ones...

26:07.275 --> 26:09.505
...who they're busy running down.

26:09.755 --> 26:13.031
Where I'm going, they know
how to handle that kind.

26:13.555 --> 26:15.034
Where are you headed?

26:15.275 --> 26:17.311
I'm going to ply my wares down in Texas.

26:18.155 --> 26:19.827
Texas, huh?

26:21.235 --> 26:23.305
How much for the ferry ride?

26:23.555 --> 26:25.147
10 cents.

26:25.635 --> 26:29.867
By coincidence, I happen to have a
bottle of this remarkable elixir...

26:30.115 --> 26:31.468
...for that exact amount.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.752
I wish I was in the land of cotton

26:35.035 --> 26:37.549
Old times there is not forgotten

26:37.795 --> 26:40.150
Look away look away

26:40.355 --> 26:42.585
Look away Dixieland

26:45.915 --> 26:48.110
Sim Carstairs is the name.

26:48.355 --> 26:49.390
Mister...?

26:50.075 --> 26:52.305
Figured we'd give you some
ferrying business.

26:53.275 --> 26:54.867
With pleasure!

26:55.595 --> 26:59.668
Bill Quantrill used this ferry
all the time.

27:00.235 --> 27:01.634
Good friend of mine.

27:02.595 --> 27:03.789
What have you got there?

27:04.995 --> 27:08.067
Just the store with
Granny Hawkins up there.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.072
I'll tell you what.

27:11.315 --> 27:13.988
We'll all just amble over to that store.

27:14.235 --> 27:17.113
Him and me will ride.
We've got a touch of the cramp.

27:17.395 --> 27:18.350
You're in luck!

27:18.595 --> 27:21.473
I just happen to have the perfect thing
here for cramps.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.266
We'll need half a side of bacon...

27:25.915 --> 27:29.066
...ten pounds of beef jerky,
twenty pounds of horse grain.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.944
And when we get over there, there won't
be any need for you to go inside.

27:33.315 --> 27:36.910
Just tell Old Granny through the door
we'll need a lot of clean bandages...

27:37.155 --> 27:41.148
...and a boiled poultice for a
bullet wound in a hurry. Come on.

27:55.555 --> 27:57.785
So you'll be Josey Wales.

28:00.075 --> 28:01.986
How might you know that, Granny?

28:02.235 --> 28:04.590
Soldiers were here looking
for you 2 hours ago.

28:05.915 --> 28:09.271
I was going to mention that to you
as soon as I got the chance.

28:09.515 --> 28:11.187
They say you killed your own men.

28:11.435 --> 28:13.505
Those lying blue scumbellies!

28:13.715 --> 28:16.673
They say you're a hard-put
and desperate man.

28:17.675 --> 28:20.473
They're going to heel and hog you
to a barn door.

28:21.915 --> 28:23.268
You know what I say?

28:23.995 --> 28:24.905
What's that?

28:25.155 --> 28:27.794
I say that big talk's worth
diddlysquat.

28:28.075 --> 28:31.988
Now them poultices be laced with
feather moss and mustard root.

28:32.235 --> 28:35.671
Mind you drop water on them
occasionally and keep them damp.

28:36.555 --> 28:37.624
Much obliged, Granny.

28:37.875 --> 28:40.992
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.

28:43.675 --> 28:45.267
I reckon so.

29:00.475 --> 29:03.911
That sure is a sweet sound
to the ears...

29:04.155 --> 29:06.305
...wouldn't you say so, Mr. Wales?

29:06.555 --> 29:08.432
Your young friend can use some help.

29:08.675 --> 29:10.347
This is it. One dollar a bottle.

29:10.595 --> 29:12.665
It works wonders on wounds.

29:12.915 --> 29:14.826
Works wonders on
just about everything.

29:15.075 --> 29:17.066
It can do most anything.

29:18.835 --> 29:20.666
How is it with stains?

29:34.115 --> 29:35.833
Here we go.

29:49.275 --> 29:52.347
Dismount. Disembark, children.

29:53.995 --> 29:55.189
Get that back!

29:55.435 --> 29:56.868
Bring it back!

29:57.995 --> 29:59.667
Bring that barge back!

30:01.275 --> 30:02.185
Bring it back!

30:02.435 --> 30:04.232
Whupped them again, Josey.

30:04.475 --> 30:06.670
They're hollering for me to come over!

30:07.115 --> 30:09.026
I can't hold on.

30:09.715 --> 30:13.230
But I'll hold on until you fellows
get out of sight.

30:13.475 --> 30:14.908
All right?

30:15.155 --> 30:17.066
I'll make do something's wrong...

30:17.315 --> 30:18.668
Pull, Lemuel. Pull!

30:18.915 --> 30:22.351
I'll make do something's wrong,
until you get going.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.748
I wish you all lots of luck.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.231
Pull, Lemuel, pull!

30:32.795 --> 30:34.626
He ain't going to hold up no ferry.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.708
He's going to bring that cavalry
over fast as he can.

30:39.875 --> 30:43.550
Reckon there's a nice reward out
for us about now.

30:53.995 --> 30:55.394
We got him now.

30:55.635 --> 30:58.149
We'll get those two first,
then the others.

30:58.395 --> 30:59.669
What others?

30:59.915 --> 31:01.906
Wales and the kid are the last ones.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.386
Texas is full of rebels.

31:05.635 --> 31:07.546
Lots of work to do down in Texas.

31:07.795 --> 31:10.070
We get Josey Wales and it ends.

31:11.355 --> 31:13.232
Doing right ain't got no end.

31:19.515 --> 31:21.426
We best hurry on, Josey.

31:22.035 --> 31:24.947
They'd catch up to us
by the end of the day.

31:25.195 --> 31:27.550
Judging by these tracks,
there's maybe...

31:27.795 --> 31:30.229
...40, 50 horses ahead of us.

31:30.475 --> 31:34.309
What we've got to do is space some time
between them and us.

31:35.355 --> 31:36.913
What are we going to do?

31:37.995 --> 31:39.587
Stay right here.

31:42.315 --> 31:43.270
Welcome.

31:43.515 --> 31:45.267
Welcome, gentlemen.

31:58.475 --> 31:59.351
Pull, Lemuel.

32:00.075 --> 32:02.145
He's still there.

32:02.675 --> 32:04.267
What does he think he's doing?

32:04.915 --> 32:06.234
Don't know.

32:06.475 --> 32:08.943
Some of you men get down there.
Prepare to fire.

32:10.675 --> 32:12.188
Captain Redlegs...

32:13.155 --> 32:14.474
...I advise you to turn back.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.307
You can catch him later.

32:16.555 --> 32:19.149
Turn back? Are you crazy?

32:19.555 --> 32:21.307
He'll try to pick us off one by one.

32:22.195 --> 32:23.423
He'll never do it.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.586
At best, he'll get 2 or 3 up front.

32:27.995 --> 32:30.304
I advise you to turn back, Captain.

32:31.235 --> 32:32.065
They're coming.

32:56.915 --> 32:59.793
Do you really think you can shoot
all those men down...

33:00.035 --> 33:01.991
...before they shoot you?

33:03.835 --> 33:05.553
No, Mr. Josey Wales!

33:05.795 --> 33:09.583
There is such a thing in this country
called justice.

33:11.835 --> 33:13.985
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger...

33:14.395 --> 33:16.784
...we've got something in this
territory...

33:18.715 --> 33:20.671
...called the Missouri boat ride.

33:42.875 --> 33:43.864
God Almighty!

34:16.554 --> 34:17.590
Is it bad?

34:17.915 --> 34:19.268
It's bad.

34:20.554 --> 34:22.147
Don't look at it, boy.

34:22.514 --> 34:25.154
It'll just make you get feelings in it.

34:28.995 --> 34:31.110
If I don't make it...

34:31.395 --> 34:32.908
...I want you to know...

34:33.155 --> 34:35.668
...I'm prouder than a game rooster
to have rid with you.

34:36.395 --> 34:38.147
You are a game rooster.
Now shut up.

34:39.195 --> 34:41.072
You could make it without me.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.512
Take a little drink of this.

34:59.275 --> 35:02.347
This here linsey-woolsey shirt I got
that all you boys wore.

35:03.595 --> 35:05.551
We didn't have no ma.

35:07.635 --> 35:10.707
So Pa did all the
fancy needlework for me.

35:13.115 --> 35:15.106
Told me not to tell no one.

35:17.915 --> 35:21.624
Imagine a grown man doing that
for his own kid?

35:23.795 --> 35:26.434
Sang a little song while he sewed it.

35:27.515 --> 35:29.585
You know Rose of Alabama?

35:32.635 --> 35:35.024
River rolled
The crickets sang

35:35.275 --> 35:38.233
The lightning bug
He flashed his wing

35:38.675 --> 35:41.109
And I could rope
My arms I fling

35:41.355 --> 35:43.915
'Round Rose of Alabama

35:55.675 --> 35:58.872
Now you just do that, cousin.
You bring that old pistol right out.

36:00.155 --> 36:01.668
We got him, Lige.

36:02.715 --> 36:04.273
It's him, Abe. It's him.

36:04.515 --> 36:06.073
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!

36:06.315 --> 36:09.705
I seen him ride side by side
with Bloody Bill.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.668
We got reward money coming.

36:12.715 --> 36:13.670
Watch it, Abe.

36:13.915 --> 36:16.145
He's meaner than a rattler
and twice as fast!

36:16.395 --> 36:19.592
You're a real bush hog,
ain't you, Mr. Josey Wales?

36:20.035 --> 36:20.785
Tell you what.

36:21.195 --> 36:23.629
Move on back. Move on back!

36:23.875 --> 36:25.911
Watch him.
I seen him do some things.

36:26.155 --> 36:27.508
Shut up, Lige!

36:33.035 --> 36:34.354
Now...

36:35.235 --> 36:36.987
...Mr. Josey Wales...

36:37.435 --> 36:38.948
I'd just as soon shoot you now...

36:39.195 --> 36:42.870
...except it'd be hard to drag your body
to where we can get our price for you.

36:43.115 --> 36:43.991
Shoot him now!

36:44.235 --> 36:45.907
Shut up, Lige.

36:47.115 --> 36:50.869
Move your left hand down and
unbuckle that pistol belt.

36:52.075 --> 36:53.986
Make it nice and slow...

36:54.395 --> 36:56.625
...so I can count the hairs
on that hand.

37:18.115 --> 37:19.343
See, Lige?

37:20.915 --> 37:22.712
You pull his teeth...

37:23.035 --> 37:25.833
...he's harmless as a heel hound.

37:27.635 --> 37:31.548
Always wanted to face out one of these
pistol fighters they all fuss about.

37:32.635 --> 37:33.988
Only way you handle them.

37:34.235 --> 37:36.112
Abe, watch out.

37:36.635 --> 37:39.149
- He's probably got another pistol...
- Shut up, Lige.

37:39.795 --> 37:42.389
Call Benny back there on the horse.

37:42.915 --> 37:44.906
Benny! Come out!

37:45.435 --> 37:47.665
We got us the Josey Wales!

37:52.475 --> 37:53.828
Who is that?

37:55.435 --> 37:57.471
He's just a boy. He's got a fever.

37:58.595 --> 37:59.664
Tell him to shut up.

38:04.675 --> 38:05.790
Pa?

38:06.115 --> 38:07.184
Is that you, Pa?

38:07.475 --> 38:08.988
It ain't your pa!

38:09.235 --> 38:10.065
Now shut up!

38:12.715 --> 38:14.592
I got the gold right here, Pa.

38:15.995 --> 38:17.553
What gold is he talking about?

38:18.555 --> 38:19.988
There's no gold. He's crazy.

38:20.235 --> 38:22.430
The gold me and Josey robbed
from the bank.

38:26.395 --> 38:28.511
Take a look under that blanket.

38:30.315 --> 38:31.953
I got it right here.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.313
Thought you could use some help.

38:53.475 --> 38:57.753
You get those holes leaking, I'm going
to whomp you with a knotted plow-line.

38:58.395 --> 39:00.033
They ain't honest.

39:00.355 --> 39:02.869
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.

39:04.195 --> 39:05.264
Good.

39:06.555 --> 39:09.149
Because I ain't hauling you
all over hell's creation...

39:09.395 --> 39:11.670
...dribbling blood over
half of Missouri.

39:13.555 --> 39:15.625
Wish we had time to bury them fellows.

39:16.635 --> 39:18.466
To hell with them fellows.

39:20.635 --> 39:23.627
Buzzards got to eat, same as worms.

39:44.835 --> 39:47.303
A real frog strangler.

39:48.595 --> 39:52.986
10, 20 more miles and we'll be
safe in the Nations.

40:01.115 --> 40:03.993
Some cavalry between us and the Nations.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.465
We'll have to wait
till they bed down...

40:06.715 --> 40:08.228
...then walk through quiet.

40:08.795 --> 40:10.706
Here, have some beef jerky.

40:11.275 --> 40:14.426
Don't swallow nothing but the juice.
I'll go have a look-see.

40:14.715 --> 40:16.068
You feel all right?

40:16.435 --> 40:19.393
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.

40:23.035 --> 40:24.184
I want to thank you.

40:24.435 --> 40:25.311
For what?

40:26.235 --> 40:27.463
For saving my life.

40:28.755 --> 40:30.473
Forget about that, Jamie.

40:30.715 --> 40:32.467
You know something, Josey?

40:33.875 --> 40:35.388
I ain't scared no more.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.394
We can start working our way
through now, boy.

41:11.795 --> 41:13.751
This rain is giving us the...

41:37.755 --> 41:39.552
This boy was brought up in a...

41:40.075 --> 41:42.714
...time of blood and dying,
and never questioned a bit of it.

41:43.555 --> 41:46.433
Never turned his back
on his folks or his kind.

41:48.395 --> 41:51.512
I rode with him, I got no complaints.

41:52.115 --> 41:56.427
The bluebellies will give you
a better burial than I can, boy.

43:42.675 --> 43:44.631
My name is Josey Wales.

43:45.555 --> 43:47.671
I've heard of that name.

43:48.915 --> 43:51.634
Some said you'd be headed this way.

43:53.035 --> 43:57.074
And they said a man could get rich
on reward money...

43:57.315 --> 43:58.748
...if he could kill you.

43:59.155 --> 44:02.545
Seems like you were looking
to gain some money here.

44:03.155 --> 44:06.147
Actually, I was looking
to gain an edge.

44:07.035 --> 44:10.869
I thought you might be someone who
would sneak up behind me with a gun.

44:11.275 --> 44:13.584
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?

44:14.035 --> 44:16.754
It ain't supposed to be easy
to sneak up behind an Indian.

44:18.115 --> 44:20.310
I'm an Indian, all right.

44:20.835 --> 44:24.623
But here in the Nation,
they call us the civilized tribe.

44:25.675 --> 44:29.873
They call us civilized because
we're easy to sneak up on.

44:31.235 --> 44:35.194
White men have been sneaking up
on us for years.

44:36.155 --> 44:37.747
Cherokee, huh?

44:40.475 --> 44:45.151
They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn't be happy here.

44:45.515 --> 44:48.666
They said we would be happier
in the Nations.

44:49.355 --> 44:52.188
So they took away our land...

44:52.435 --> 44:54.232
...and sent us here.

44:56.155 --> 44:58.464
I have a fine woman...

44:59.475 --> 45:01.227
...and two sons.

45:01.475 --> 45:04.672
But they all died on the
Trail of Tears.

45:07.075 --> 45:11.546
And now the white man
is sneaking up on me.

45:13.315 --> 45:14.225
Again.

45:20.395 --> 45:22.750
Seems like we can't trust
the white man.

45:22.995 --> 45:25.190
You bet we can't.

45:27.515 --> 45:29.187
I wore this...

45:29.995 --> 45:32.589
...frock coat in Washington.

45:32.835 --> 45:34.268
Before the war.

45:35.155 --> 45:37.794
We wore them because we belonged to...

45:38.035 --> 45:40.105
...the five civilized tribes.

45:42.515 --> 45:45.473
We dressed ourselves up
like Abraham Lincoln.

45:49.155 --> 45:53.706
We got to see the
Secretary of the Interior.

45:54.715 --> 45:56.228
And he said...

45:57.315 --> 45:59.875
..."Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

46:01.235 --> 46:03.430
He congratulated us...

46:03.675 --> 46:07.384
...and he gave us medals for
looking so civilized.

46:07.635 --> 46:11.184
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...

46:11.675 --> 46:13.631
...and our people were dying.

46:15.115 --> 46:17.834
When we finished, he shook our hands...

46:18.115 --> 46:19.343
...and said...

46:20.115 --> 46:23.073
..."Endeavor to persevere."

46:23.635 --> 46:25.432
They stood us in a line.

46:25.675 --> 46:28.633
John Jumper, Chilly Mclntosh...

46:29.475 --> 46:31.033
...Buffalo Hump...

46:32.515 --> 46:34.790
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.

46:35.035 --> 46:36.229
I'm Lone Watie.

46:36.635 --> 46:38.546
They took our pictures.

46:39.075 --> 46:41.270
And the newspaper said...

46:41.795 --> 46:46.186
..." Indians Vow to
Endeavor to Persevere."

46:46.875 --> 46:49.264
We thought about it for a long time.

46:49.875 --> 46:52.230
"Endeavor to persevere."

46:52.795 --> 46:56.504
And when we had thought
about it long enough...

46:56.875 --> 46:59.594
...we declared war on the Union.

47:13.315 --> 47:16.864
Sergeant said this kid tried to ride
through their camp. They got him.

47:18.435 --> 47:20.107
They did, did they?

47:21.315 --> 47:23.670
They've had men on guard here
night and day.

47:23.995 --> 47:25.986
No way Wales could get to the Nations.

47:31.355 --> 47:33.186
Where are you going, Fletcher?

47:33.435 --> 47:35.790
I'm heading into the Indian Nations.

47:36.035 --> 47:38.230
Why don't you stay here, Redlegs?

47:38.875 --> 47:41.184
Wales may be back in a year or two.

47:44.395 --> 47:47.387
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.

47:47.635 --> 47:50.149
$5000 to the one who gets him.

48:08.995 --> 48:12.271
A horned toad can tell you
which way to go.

48:12.555 --> 48:16.025
I used to know these things
when I was young.

48:17.115 --> 48:19.948
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.

48:20.195 --> 48:22.026
I didn't know which way to go.

48:22.435 --> 48:25.472
The horned toad says
we should go to Mexico.

48:32.795 --> 48:35.070
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...

48:37.075 --> 48:40.112
...you can take your horned toad
down Mexico way.

48:40.835 --> 48:43.349
I've got some unfinished
business in Missouri.

48:44.035 --> 48:46.390
I heard General Joe Shelby...

48:46.635 --> 48:49.388
...and some men refused to surrender.

48:49.635 --> 48:51.227
They're going down to Mexico.

48:51.475 --> 48:52.794
I think I'll join them.

48:53.475 --> 48:54.794
Shelby, huh?

48:55.035 --> 48:56.912
I didn't know others hadn't surrendered.

48:57.275 --> 48:59.072
I didn't surrender, neither.

48:59.315 --> 49:02.864
But they took my horse
and made him surrender.

49:03.115 --> 49:06.187
They have him pulling a wagon
up in Kansas, I'll bet.

49:09.155 --> 49:10.827
You haven't got a horse.

49:11.155 --> 49:13.464
What do you plan on doing,
walking to Mexico?

49:13.715 --> 49:16.548
No, there's a trading post
right near the Creek Nation.

49:16.715 --> 49:18.592
They got horses to trade.

49:20.115 --> 49:21.673
You have any food here?

49:23.235 --> 49:26.272
All I have is a piece of
hard rock candy.

49:27.675 --> 49:29.233
But it's not for eating.

49:29.475 --> 49:31.625
It's just for looking through.

49:34.875 --> 49:36.194
All right.

49:40.195 --> 49:42.026
I'll get you a horse.

50:04.475 --> 50:05.749
What have you got there?

50:05.995 --> 50:07.030
Muskrat.

50:07.275 --> 50:08.674
Muskrat?

50:08.915 --> 50:09.950
What the hell's that?

50:10.195 --> 50:11.514
Muskrat.

50:12.515 --> 50:15.473
No, sir.
You got to come up with something more.

50:16.155 --> 50:17.986
- Beaver?
- Beaver ain't no good no more.

50:18.235 --> 50:20.032
Get me 10 muskrats...

50:20.515 --> 50:22.710
...and 30 beaver pelts...

50:23.035 --> 50:24.991
...and I'll give you red cloth.

50:26.275 --> 50:28.630
Now that's a very good bargain for you.

50:31.875 --> 50:33.069
Here.

50:33.355 --> 50:36.153
You go have a drink and think about it.

50:53.795 --> 50:56.025
You bring some drink inside, you hear?

51:05.315 --> 51:07.783
I'll tell you, this jerky?

51:08.035 --> 51:09.548
Put it on our bill.

51:10.355 --> 51:12.027
What about these cougar pelts?

51:12.275 --> 51:14.311
Going to put them on our bill too?

51:18.515 --> 51:20.631
This what you give those Indians.

51:21.715 --> 51:22.830
Where's the real stuff?

51:39.035 --> 51:40.787
What do you take for the squaw?

51:41.195 --> 51:42.833
She ain't for sale.

51:44.995 --> 51:46.986
I mean, she ain't mine.

51:47.315 --> 51:49.192
She works here.

51:52.475 --> 51:53.749
See that nose scar?

51:56.075 --> 51:58.111
Know what that means to a Cheyenne?

51:58.355 --> 51:59.947
One too many bucks.

52:00.915 --> 52:03.031
Little squaw likes the bucks, huh?

52:03.275 --> 52:06.073
Tell you, Zukie, you put her
on the bill too.

52:36.475 --> 52:38.386
I'll be looking for a horse.

52:39.355 --> 52:40.470
A horse?

52:41.915 --> 52:44.110
The horses belong to these gentlemen.

52:44.635 --> 52:46.865
More than likely...
That is...

52:47.115 --> 52:49.265
...I'm sure they'd sell you one.

52:56.195 --> 52:58.186
Look, I've got some beer.

52:58.475 --> 53:00.193
Some good brewed choc.

53:02.395 --> 53:03.350
It's on the house.

53:19.515 --> 53:21.233
You suppose these gentlemen will be...

53:21.475 --> 53:24.194
...available to discuss business
before long?

53:29.755 --> 53:31.825
Give me a bucket of that choc.

53:41.035 --> 53:41.911
I got him!

53:42.595 --> 53:44.472
I got me Josey Wales!

53:48.155 --> 53:51.352
5000 gold simoleons walked right in.

53:51.755 --> 53:53.666
- Right to us.
- Wait a minute!

53:53.915 --> 53:55.109
He's in my place.

53:55.555 --> 53:56.670
I recognized him too.

53:58.235 --> 53:59.509
I'm due an even split.

54:03.075 --> 54:06.226
Mr. Chain-Blue Lightning himself.

54:08.675 --> 54:11.348
The one that everyone's so scared of.

54:12.075 --> 54:13.872
Well, Mr. Lightning...

54:14.515 --> 54:17.746
...move a muscle, twitch a finger...

54:17.995 --> 54:20.463
...and I'll splatter your guts
all over the wall.

54:24.235 --> 54:25.827
When I say move...

54:26.075 --> 54:27.793
...you move real slow...

54:28.035 --> 54:29.912
...like molasses in wintertime.

54:30.235 --> 54:31.827
All right, drop that hammer.

54:32.235 --> 54:35.545
Now, just ease your hands down.

54:36.435 --> 54:40.428
Take them guns out, butt first
so's you can get hold of them.

54:42.435 --> 54:43.504
You understand?

54:45.355 --> 54:46.674
Nod, damn you!

54:51.275 --> 54:52.310
Now...

54:53.075 --> 54:55.384
...ease them pistols out.

55:26.475 --> 55:28.033
Well, let's see...

55:29.035 --> 55:31.549
...you say those horses belong
to them pilgrims?

56:09.035 --> 56:12.345
I'm getting better at sneaking up
on you like this.

56:12.835 --> 56:15.303
Only an Indian can do
something like this.

56:17.475 --> 56:18.703
That's what I figured.

56:19.235 --> 56:20.304
You figured?

56:21.515 --> 56:24.075
Only an Indian could do
something like that.

56:38.395 --> 56:42.354
It's not right, this damn woman
doing something like this to me.

56:42.675 --> 56:44.393
I used to have power.

56:44.635 --> 56:46.785
Now old age is creeping up on me.

56:48.555 --> 56:52.548
I think it's more like
old habits than old age.

56:53.715 --> 56:55.512
Who the hell is this woman?

56:56.555 --> 56:59.911
She was back at the trading post.
Got in some kind of trouble.

57:00.635 --> 57:02.910
She's not going to Mexico with us.

57:03.155 --> 57:03.985
With us?

57:04.235 --> 57:07.386
Now wait a minute. I got you a horse.
You're on your own now.

57:07.595 --> 57:09.108
I've seen a lot today.

57:09.355 --> 57:12.825
I've seen patrols of soldiers all day.

57:13.475 --> 57:15.989
Everybody's looking for you.

57:17.995 --> 57:19.508
She's not going with us.

57:33.195 --> 57:35.231
She says she's Navajo...

57:35.475 --> 57:38.069
...but she was captured
by the Cheyenne.

57:38.315 --> 57:41.990
She was violated by one of the bucks
of the Arapahos.

57:42.235 --> 57:44.749
Their sign is the dirty nose sign.

57:44.995 --> 57:47.270
Cheyenne Chief, Black Kettle...

57:47.515 --> 57:51.303
...figures that she did not
resist enough.

57:59.515 --> 58:02.154
Hell, man, can't you get
her to shut up?

58:25.795 --> 58:27.751
Anyway, she says...

58:27.995 --> 58:30.589
...when she came to that trading post...

58:30.835 --> 58:33.713
...she didn't know this man,
Zukie Limmer...

58:33.955 --> 58:35.354
...was selling liquor.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.870
She also wants you to know...

58:38.115 --> 58:40.310
...that although he beat her a lot...

58:40.555 --> 58:42.989
...nothing happened between them.

58:44.435 --> 58:47.029
And she says you are a great warrior...

58:47.275 --> 58:51.905
...and that she sort of belongs to you
for what you done for her.

58:53.115 --> 58:56.187
Look, you tell her I don't want
nobody belonging to me.

58:58.915 --> 59:00.826
That meal was damn good.

59:01.075 --> 59:05.034
I'm going to take up tepee living
if it's like this.

59:06.315 --> 59:09.625
You know, she thinks I'm some kind
of a Cherokee chief.

59:11.355 --> 59:14.188
I wonder where she ever got that idea.

59:21.355 --> 59:22.549
Chief!

59:30.715 --> 59:32.353
I was just wondering.

59:32.595 --> 59:35.826
I suppose that mangy hound's
got no place else to go either.

59:40.475 --> 59:42.909
He might as well ride along with us.

59:43.395 --> 59:45.590
Hell, everybody else is.

01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:32.190
Hey, you!

01:00:33.315 --> 01:00:34.873
Want to buy some Indian scalps?

01:01:39.515 --> 01:01:40.914
Nasty habit, young fellow.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.146
You born in the barn?

01:01:56.315 --> 01:02:00.103
The wheat is from Kansas and the
molasses comes from Missouri.

01:02:00.355 --> 01:02:01.788
We'll do without molasses.

01:02:02.035 --> 01:02:04.344
Anything from Missouri
has a taint about it.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:07.667
Grandma, you've got to tread
lightly now we're here in Texas.

01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:10.304
Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.

01:02:10.555 --> 01:02:14.628
Nothing nice comes from Missouri.
And treading lightly is not my way.

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:17.389
We're from Kansas.
Jayhawkers, and proud of it.

01:02:17.635 --> 01:02:20.024
I know how you feel.
I'm a Hoosier, myself.

01:02:20.435 --> 01:02:23.472
Personally, I don't think much
of Hoosiers neither.

01:02:33.715 --> 01:02:34.989
Yes, friends, yes!

01:02:35.235 --> 01:02:38.227
This is a positive remedy
for weariness...

01:02:38.475 --> 01:02:41.751
...turgidity of the bowels and...

01:02:44.395 --> 01:02:46.784
Say, you're an Indian, aren't you?

01:02:49.435 --> 01:02:51.232
You speak any English?

01:02:51.675 --> 01:02:54.348
Well, sir, this is the
very best thing...

01:02:54.595 --> 01:02:57.029
...for those who can't handle
their liquor.

01:03:00.315 --> 01:03:01.748
What's in it?

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:07.386
I don't know. Various things.
I'm only the salesman.

01:03:09.155 --> 01:03:10.190
You drink it.

01:03:10.435 --> 01:03:11.629
What's that?

01:03:13.435 --> 01:03:14.868
You drink it.

01:03:22.475 --> 01:03:24.989
What can you expect from a nonbeliever?

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:29.544
That old lady don't know the trouble
she can get into talking like that.

01:03:30.155 --> 01:03:32.623
Too many folks around here
with thin skin.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:35.594
Lots of Southern boys
been getting into trouble here.

01:03:35.835 --> 01:03:39.987
Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee
been fighting over in Fannin County.

01:03:40.235 --> 01:03:41.987
Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:45.108
...and all them other Taylors
down in Gonzalez.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.664
Killed Simp Dixon over in Cotton Gin...

01:03:47.915 --> 01:03:49.712
...weighted him down with lead.

01:03:50.755 --> 01:03:53.144
I got a picture postcard of it.

01:03:53.995 --> 01:03:56.225
Here. Have a look.

01:03:58.315 --> 01:03:59.430
Josey Wales.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:04.705
What say?

01:04:04.955 --> 01:04:07.389
Josey Wales.
They say he's coming into Texas.

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.627
Won't come through here though.
Killed 50, 60 men.

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:13.912
Regulators are all over the place
looking for him.

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:16.990
How much for all this?

01:04:17.235 --> 01:04:18.350
Three dollars.

01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:21.112
Those regulators would pay plenty...

01:04:21.355 --> 01:04:24.267
...to the man who could
identify Josey Wales.

01:04:25.755 --> 01:04:27.393
Reckon so.

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.464
How about you, sir?

01:04:38.715 --> 01:04:41.752
Just a few bottles left.
You won't regret it.

01:04:49.195 --> 01:04:50.674
Oh, my God!

01:04:50.955 --> 01:04:52.308
It's Josey Wales!

01:05:21.555 --> 01:05:24.115
You going to pull those pistols
or whistle "Dixie"?

01:06:20.035 --> 01:06:21.150
Goddamn Indian squaw!

01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:25.270
Let's go!

01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:03.589
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.

01:07:05.035 --> 01:07:09.108
I guess we ain't going to see that
little Navajo girl again.

01:07:09.355 --> 01:07:10.947
I guess not.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.072
I kind of liked her.

01:07:13.315 --> 01:07:15.624
- But it's always like that.
- Like what?

01:07:16.755 --> 01:07:19.394
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain't around long.

01:07:19.795 --> 01:07:24.346
I notice when you get to disliking
someone they ain't around long neither.

01:07:27.475 --> 01:07:30.228
How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?

01:07:31.435 --> 01:07:33.710
That one in the center
had a flap holster...

01:07:33.955 --> 01:07:35.991
...and he was in no itching hurry.

01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:38.353
And the one second from the left...

01:07:38.595 --> 01:07:40.950
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.

01:07:41.195 --> 01:07:42.947
But that one on the far left...

01:07:43.195 --> 01:07:46.585
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.

01:07:46.835 --> 01:07:48.234
And the one on the right?

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:55.026
Never paid no him no mind.

01:07:55.275 --> 01:07:56.344
You were there.

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:02.990
I could have missed.

01:08:03.235 --> 01:08:05.954
Yes, sir! It was Josey Wales,
all right!

01:08:06.195 --> 01:08:09.153
Saw him heading north out of town
with a renegade Injun.

01:08:10.195 --> 01:08:11.674
I can identify him.

01:08:11.915 --> 01:08:15.794
And I'd certainly be glad
to share in any reward.

01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:19.063
Knew him quite well, actually.

01:08:21.755 --> 01:08:24.064
Well, not a hard man to track.

01:08:24.635 --> 01:08:26.910
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

01:08:27.995 --> 01:08:29.747
He's heading north now...

01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:32.185
...riding with a renegade Indian.

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:35.788
He's heading north now,
but he'll turn southwest...

01:08:36.035 --> 01:08:37.388
...head for Mexico.

01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:40.388
Then we'll turn southwest
and head for Mexico.

01:08:40.835 --> 01:08:42.712
Tell them to head north.

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:45.032
What are you talking about?

01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:51.554
Look at those boys over there
with tied-down guns.

01:08:53.234 --> 01:08:54.827
Bounty hunters.

01:08:55.354 --> 01:08:58.870
Come out of a war, got no other way
to make a living.

01:08:59.675 --> 01:09:03.509
Every last mother's son of them wants
that money you've got on Wales' head.

01:09:04.395 --> 01:09:06.988
You and me didn't ride
all that way for that.

01:09:08.595 --> 01:09:10.870
I don't want to hear Wales is dead.

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:14.390
I want to see Wales dead.

01:09:18.555 --> 01:09:21.149
We're heading north, men.
Let's ride.

01:09:41.915 --> 01:09:43.029
They're following us.

01:09:45.835 --> 01:09:49.270
Couple of horses, far off, moving fast.

01:09:50.915 --> 01:09:52.029
I don't hear nothing.

01:09:53.915 --> 01:09:56.065
Got to be an Indian to know
those things.

01:10:00.995 --> 01:10:03.304
All right, let's take them
out in the sand.

01:11:12.995 --> 01:11:16.351
Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.

01:11:16.675 --> 01:11:18.393
I noticed that.

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:26.658
She got some supplies...

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.468
...and our horses...

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:30.701
...and followed us around.

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.068
She said we were the only kin she had.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.546
I bet we are, at that.

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:40.389
You know, every man I ever knew...

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.860
...who was good with a gun and lived...

01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:45.146
...always had an edge.

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.306
Some of them would like to have
the sun behind their back.

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.502
That's always a good idea.

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.784
Sure pays to have an edge.

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:05.785
All kind of edges.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.460
Howdy.

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:47.499
Is something wrong?

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.061
I guess you were right.

01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:53.780
I ain't that old, after all.

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:27.501
Not many men west of here.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.783
We're getting into Comanche country.

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.303
Wagon tracks.

01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:40.144
But I never seen tracks like these.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:43.860
Never heard of Comanches traveling
in two-wheeled carts.

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:56.468
Comancheros...

01:13:56.710 --> 01:14:00.669
...trade liquor and guns
to Comanche for horses.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:03.062
Trade women too.

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:04.540
How many?

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:07.460
Eight...

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.907
...maybe nine horses,
and a couple of carts.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:57.144
Those poor pilgrims from Kansas.

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:01.341
They don't look too proud now, do they?

01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:18.258
You son of a bitch!

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.580
Ten Bears is going to want
a fresh woman!

01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:26.543
Fresh, that little gal will
bring maybe 20 horses.

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:33.262
Now if one of you has to,
take that old woman over there.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:37.469
She might be worth maybe one donkey.

01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:01.859
Fix yourself.

01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:16.266
Move faster!

01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:22.109
If you fall...

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:25.228
...they'll let you die.
Keep walking.

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:34.300
Come around here, bitch.
Come around here.

01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:40.338
Now you listen to me.

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:43.184
I want you looking real good
when we get to Ten Bears.

01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:47.748
So I want you to jump in that wagon and
put on one of your best little dresses.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:51.707
It might boost your price.

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:56.384
If you look good enough, I might outbid
old Ten Bears and take you for myself.

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.022
If I figure this right...

01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:36.421
...we're facing the sun.

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:39.260
This ought to give him an edge.

01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:41.742
Who are you talking about?

01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:43.423
What the hell does he want?

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.023
Looks like a parlay.

01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:55.386
Are you just going to sit there or
you going to see what he wants?

01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:59.941
Get ready, little lady.

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:02.466
Hell is coming to breakfast.

01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:13.265
That's a mighty nice horse
you got there, mister.

01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:14.909
Would you sell it?

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:17.824
We will give you a good price.

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:26.579
Now spit!

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:33.660
Just get off the horse.

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:40.225
Get out of the way!

01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:38.063
Now you'll kill us, I suppose.

01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:42.380
I'd have been halfway to Mexico by now
except for that crazy squaw.

01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.621
I can't understand a word she says.

01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:47.621
I knew that would bring you.

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:03.140
Help us!

01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:08.264
Help us.

01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:10.228
Comanches.

01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:13.946
They won't like us killing these friends
of theirs. We better get moving.

01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:03.868
Looks like a family of hogs just moved
out of the seat of these britches.

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:08.148
I had such beautiful clothes...

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:10.779
...I was taking to our ranch.

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:13.747
Whereabouts is this ranch?

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:18.588
My son's ranch, he found before the war
near a town called Santo Rio.

01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:20.309
Creek with good water...

01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:22.745
...trees, cattle, black-tailed deer.

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:26.223
It's a regular paradise we're headed to.

01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:27.944
Out there?

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.344
Your son told you this was out there?

01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:34.668
He told me that.
Near a place called Blood Butte.

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:37.380
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:40.190
He never lied.
It'll be there, all right.

01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:44.984
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it will be.

01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:48.267
Cottonwoods, live oaks...

01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:50.626
...wild horses...

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:52.462
...antelope...

01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:54.342
...Iots of quail.

01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:02.699
You see them?

01:25:04.190 --> 01:25:04.940
What?

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:07.268
The clouds over there.

01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:11.662
Clouds are like...

01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:15.266
...dreams floating across
a sky-blue mind.

01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:20.386
I never thought of them that way.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:25.229
Indian...

01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:29.106
...this Mr. Wales is a
cold-blooded killer.

01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:30.544
He's from Missouri...

01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:35.022
...where they're all known to be killers
of innocent men, women and children.

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:37.943
Would you rather be riding with
Comancheros, Granny?

01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:41.862
No, I wouldn't.

01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:08.029
What'll you have?

01:27:11.150 --> 01:27:12.378
Whiskey.

01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:14.343
Whiskey, he says!

01:27:16.150 --> 01:27:17.788
How about something else?

01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:21.658
Beer, then.

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.579
And get those gents whatever
they're drinking.

01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:25.780
You too, ma'am.

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.308
That's mighty decent of you.

01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:32.587
Been a long time since anybody
bought a drink around here.

01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:35.663
About as long as we had
anything to drink around here.

01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:37.787
Or anything else.

01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:42.739
Yeah, first the silver run out
of the Santo Rio.

01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:45.021
Then the people run out.

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:46.988
Then the whiskey.

01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:49.346
Then the beer run out.

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:50.739
Well, no matter.

01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:54.310
It's good to see a high roller
wander through.

01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:09.861
I didn't mean to offend him.

01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:13.307
I guess some fellows just don't like to
be called high rollers.

01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:17.782
You know, I knew a fellow once, he
didn't like to be called highhanded.

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:22.268
We'll have whiskey all around.

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:24.228
Comanchero brand.

01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:33.424
Angels of Mercy come to Santo Rio!

01:28:33.670 --> 01:28:35.467
This ain't Santo Rio.

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:38.304
My son, Tom Turner, said it was
a thriving place.

01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:40.063
It was.

01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:43.268
But when the silver ran out,
the thriving ran out.

01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:44.579
That's right.

01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:47.219
I do declare.

01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:49.301
Might you be the mother of Tom Turner...

01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:52.462
...whose Crooked River Ranch
is over by Blood Butte?

01:28:52.710 --> 01:28:54.507
That I might, miss.

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.505
I am Rose.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.308
Rose of Santo Rio.

01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:02.939
I reckon he wrote you all about me.

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:05.659
I don't recollect that.

01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:08.299
After his Lucy passed on...

01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:10.427
...he didn't show much
interest in women.

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:16.106
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the
grindstone, providing a future for me...

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.465
...and his daughter there.

01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:24.784
I do seem to recall him
telling me something about...

01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:27.305
...a daughter who was a little...

01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:28.386
...odd.

01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:32.421
He was killed in the Border War
by Missouri ruffians.

01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:35.867
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane's Redlegs...

01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:39.229
...fighting for the just cause!

01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:41.540
I am sorry to hear that.

01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:44.668
I mean, he was of the finest sort.

01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:47.299
Señora, please sit down.

01:29:47.550 --> 01:29:50.064
You must be very, very tired.

01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:55.339
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.

01:29:55.630 --> 01:29:57.109
In past years...

01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:00.626
...my friend and I were of service
to your Tom Turner.

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:03.179
And now we are at your service.

01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:07.900
Why, I appreciate your concern.

01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:11.381
I am glad to find manners at last,
here in the wilderness.

01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:15.749
We have endured hardship of the
worst sort on the way out here.

01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:20.226
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:23.030
...fell prey to Comancheros.

01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:26.945
Let's drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!

01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:28.862
Bad luck, the silver running out.

01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:32.147
I wouldn't have any other kind!

01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:41.059
What'll you have?

01:30:42.630 --> 01:30:44.586
I'm looking for Josey Wales.

01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:48.865
That'll be me.

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:54.182
You're wanted, Wales.

01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:56.506
Reckon I'm right popular.

01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:00.109
You a bounty hunter?

01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:03.189
A man's got to do something for
a living these days.

01:31:04.230 --> 01:31:06.619
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.

01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:12.426
You know, this isn't necessary.

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:15.221
You can just ride on.

01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:52.858
I had to come back.

01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:55.139
I know.

01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:37.859
- Comanche?
- Comanches, all right.

01:32:38.630 --> 01:32:39.824
Any more of them?

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:42.106
I think that's all there is...

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.029
...but they have horses
packing antelope...

01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:47.579
...so I figure they're not
a raiding party.

01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:50.345
But you never can tell these Comanches.

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:52.909
You stay with the cart.

01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:13.546
Just looking us over, I guess.

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:15.821
They're packing heavy.

01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:17.139
They may return.

01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:18.948
All right, let's move out.

01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:28.698
If they ride with Ten Bears...

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:30.508
...they will come back.

01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:34.382
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:35.899
But he's angry.

01:33:36.150 --> 01:33:39.381
Each year, he has met with
one of your bluecoat generals.

01:33:39.630 --> 01:33:40.619
Ain't my generals.

01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:44.306
And each year he is pushed further
across the plains.

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:47.383
General Sherman has come
with more promises.

01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:49.985
But Ten Bears will move no more.

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:44.299
It's so beautiful.

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:55.426
All right, we can get to work
dusting first.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:35:00.506
Got a nice Dutch oven
in the fireplace here.

01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:04.584
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.947
Now, get everything done.

01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:10.505
Mr. Wales!

01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:13.470
Did you come all this way to gawk?

01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:16.419
If you don't work,
you don't eat around here.

01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:18.740
Didn't figure you for a loafer.

01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:45.470
You know, she told me...

01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:49.828
...it's the first time she ever had
a place of her own.

01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:53.425
Grandma says it's our home.

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:55.980
It is all of ours.

01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:59.907
I'm glad there will be a man
around to take care of things.

01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:03.343
I'll be dropping back
from time to time...

01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:06.186
...probably just to hole up.

01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:09.105
Why don't you stay with us?

01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:11.347
Be our partner.

01:36:12.710 --> 01:36:13.984
They won't miss you.

01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:16.346
Maybe they'll forget you.

01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:20.699
You know there ain't no forgetting.

01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:10.299
Pa!

01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:41.542
Hey, there, Josey!

01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:48.580
We're going to Santo Rio!

01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:32.580
Lord...

01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:36.262
...thanks a lot for bringing us
to this place.

01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:38.663
Pa and Daniel died...

01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:42.380
...at the hands of that low-down,
murdering trash out of hell...

01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:44.348
...that done them in.

01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:48.180
But they put up a good fight
and died the best they could.

01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:50.621
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...

01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:54.587
...who you changed from a
murdering bushwhacker...

01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:56.502
...on the side of Satan...

01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:58.229
...to a better man...

01:38:58.470 --> 01:39:01.268
...in time to deliver us
from the Philistines.

01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:05.709
And thank you, Lord, for
getting us together in Texas.

01:39:13.110 --> 01:39:14.589
Are you all right?

01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:15.740
Ten Bears...

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:18.106
...he got Travis and Chato.

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:20.705
He'll be riding here in the morning.

01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:41.462
If I was looking for a place
to hole up, I'd pick this one.

01:39:41.710 --> 01:39:44.099
Walls and ceiling, 2 feet thick.

01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:46.386
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.

01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:50.747
Two doors, front and back,
right in sight of one another.

01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:54.866
These here crosses are to fire rifles
through. Up and down, side to side.

01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:56.941
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.

01:39:57.190 --> 01:39:59.385
You bet.
I'll be shooting out that door.

01:39:59.630 --> 01:40:01.780
I'd rather have you sit right there...

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:04.180
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?

01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:05.749
I can.

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:08.144
Moonlight...

01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:12.623
...I want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?

01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:15.430
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?

01:40:15.670 --> 01:40:16.739
I'll try.

01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:20.107
Lone, you take this window
right over here, and the door.

01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:21.783
Where there's the most firing.

01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:25.989
You'll have to keep an eye on
that hallway there because...

01:40:27.670 --> 01:40:31.629
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They'll get around to it eventually.

01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:34.304
They can't shoot through it,
but they might...

01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:37.587
...dig a hole in it and drop down,
maybe in the back bedroom.

01:40:39.190 --> 01:40:40.509
Now remember...

01:40:41.150 --> 01:40:44.142
...when things look bad, and it looks
like you won't make it...

01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:45.829
...then you got to get mean.

01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:48.220
I mean plumb, maddog mean!

01:40:48.710 --> 01:40:52.339
Because if you lose your head and
give up, then you neither live nor win.

01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:54.309
That's just the way it is.

01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:58.305
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.

01:40:58.550 --> 01:41:01.223
Keep this fire going.
Keep an iron on it red-hot.

01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:03.381
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.

01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:05.905
That's the fastest way
to stop the blood.

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:11.221
What's all that paint about?

01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:12.983
It's my death face.

01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:17.749
You know, we're sure going to show them
redskins something tomorrow!

01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:19.389
No offense meant.

01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:22.108
None taken.

01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:33.140
Where's he going?

01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:37.105
He knows he can do the best for us
on the back of a horse.

01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:38.829
He's a guerrilla fighter.

01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:42.148
He figures he can carry the fight
to the enemy.

01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:45.985
He's going down into the valley
to kill Ten Bears...

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:48.665
...and as many of the men as he can.

01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:50.946
How will he do that and come back here?

01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:53.658
He won't come back.

01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:22.505
You be Ten Bears?

01:44:23.230 --> 01:44:24.868
I am Ten Bears.

01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:31.142
I'm Josey Wales.

01:44:33.190 --> 01:44:34.782
I have heard.

01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:37.542
You're the Gray Rider.

01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:42.147
You would not make peace with the
Bluecoats. You may go in peace.

01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:44.819
I reckon not.

01:44:50.590 --> 01:44:51.545
Got nowhere to go.

01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:53.669
Then you will die.

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:57.667
I came here to die with you.

01:44:59.910 --> 01:45:01.343
Or live with you.

01:45:02.710 --> 01:45:05.668
Dying's not hard for you and me.
It's living that's hard...

01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:08.788
...when all you ever cared about has
been butchered or raped.

01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:14.428
Governments don't live together.
People live together.

01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:19.461
Governments don't give you a fair word
or a fair fight. I've come here to...

01:45:19.710 --> 01:45:22.349
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.

01:45:25.630 --> 01:45:29.066
I came here like this so you'll know
my word of death is true.

01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:31.705
And that my word of life is then true.

01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:39.221
The bear lives here, the wolf, the
antelope, the Comanche.

01:45:39.670 --> 01:45:41.342
And so will we.

01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:45.666
We'll only hunt what we need to live on,
same as the Comanche does.

01:45:46.630 --> 01:45:49.622
And every spring when
the Comanche moves north...

01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:51.349
...he can rest here in peace...

01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:54.980
...butcher some of our cattle
and jerk beef for the journey.

01:45:55.630 --> 01:45:59.225
The sign of the Comanche,
that will be on our lodge.

01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:00.585
That's my word of life.

01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:02.788
And your word of death?

01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:06.702
It's here in my pistols
and there in your rifles.

01:46:06.990 --> 01:46:08.218
I'm here for either one.

01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:12.702
These things you say we will have,
we already have.

01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:16.825
That's true.
I ain't promising you nothing extra.

01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:20.387
I'm just giving you life,
and you're giving me life.

01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:24.259
And I'm saying men can live together
without butchering one another.

01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:30.948
It's sad that governments are chiefed
by the double-tongues.

01:46:31.190 --> 01:46:35.103
There is iron in your words of death
for all Comanches to see.

01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:38.228
And so there is iron
in your words of life.

01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:42.226
No signed paper can hold the iron.

01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:44.381
It must come from men.

01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:49.223
The words of Ten Bears carry
the same iron of life and death.

01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:53.828
It is good that warriors such as we
meet in the struggle of life...

01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:55.225
...or death.

01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:00.181
It shall be life.

01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:25.865
So will it be.

01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:28.542
I reckon so.

01:47:30.990 --> 01:47:33.220
I'll be damned! Look at this!

01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:45.945
Come. Sit down.

01:47:46.190 --> 01:47:48.750
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:55.185
Sit down.

01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:57.341
I never been so glad to see an Indian.

01:48:59.590 --> 01:49:02.150
I've got something to show you,
Mr. Wales.

01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:06.226
I made this chain for you.

01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:08.381
I braided it from my hair.

01:49:11.110 --> 01:49:13.465
That's real nice. It really is.

01:49:13.710 --> 01:49:15.428
It's a watch chain.

01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:20.704
It's a nice one. It will come in handy.
I thank you for it.

01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:25.500
You do have a watch, don't you?

01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:31.379
I've been meaning to get one.

01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:34.942
Could we...

01:49:35.190 --> 01:49:36.862
...play a song for you?

01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:42.462
I'm afraid I don't really know
too many songs.

01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:54.748
Could we play something you like?
Come on.

01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:58.461
Only song I can think of is
"Rose of Alabama."

01:49:59.150 --> 01:50:01.823
We remember that old piece.
Rosie, come here.

01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:18.623
Do you dance?

01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:21.309
Me neither.

01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:30.867
I could see him through this
window when he shot my partner.

01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:34.262
He was traveling with an
old Injun and a squaw...

01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:36.660
...and some old lady and a scrawny girl.

01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:41.059
Had to be him. He had this scar
right on his face, right here.

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:43.945
I wasn't about to face him down alone.

01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:51.269
You men get them horses out of sight.

01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:57.460
If Josey Wales comes back here,
we'll buy him a drink.

01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:41.141
Kansas was all...

01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:44.981
...golden and smelled like sunshine.

01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:51.901
I always heard there were 3 kinds
of suns in Kansas.

01:52:52.590 --> 01:52:53.989
Sunshine...

01:52:54.670 --> 01:52:56.023
...sunflowers...

01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:57.988
...and sons of bitches.

01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:04.863
At least that's something.

01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:10.945
I heard a joke about Missouri once.

01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:14.342
Something about how people
from Missouri...

01:53:14.590 --> 01:53:17.343
...are always saying, "Show me."

01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:19.908
Do you know it?

01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:22.109
I think it was:

01:53:25.630 --> 01:53:28.019
What does a man from Missouri say...

01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:32.263
...if someone asks him to see a
Missouri mule?

01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:35.786
He says, "Show me."

01:53:38.190 --> 01:53:39.464
Get it?

01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:42.628
They teach dumb jokes to
pretty girls in Kansas.

01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:46.942
They teach other things.

01:53:54.670 --> 01:53:56.069
Show me.

01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:33.383
Pa!

01:55:07.630 --> 01:55:09.586
You're up kind of early, aren't you?

01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:14.381
It's been nice riding with you.

01:55:15.630 --> 01:55:16.380
Same here.

01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:21.463
When you get to town, get some nice
dresses for the ladies, you hear?

01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:23.380
I will.

01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:27.823
Get something specially nice for Laura
Lee for when I come back in the spring.

01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:36.981
Or the following spring.

01:55:42.630 --> 01:55:45.303
Sometimes trouble just follows a man.

01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:48.704
Hell, I've been here way
too long as it...

01:55:55.190 --> 01:55:56.862
I reckon so.

01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:46.349
You're all alone now, Wales.

01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:49.622
Not quite alone.

01:58:28.630 --> 01:58:32.179
Now we're really going to show
these palefaces something!

01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:33.465
No offense.

01:58:33.710 --> 01:58:34.938
None taken.

01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:39.183
These freebooters are a
slander to Kansas...

01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:42.228
...attacking innocent women like this.

02:03:59.590 --> 02:04:00.739
The bullets were flying...

02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:03.868
...and people running every which way.

02:04:04.110 --> 02:04:07.261
Church bells were ringing.
Me and Miss Rose were ducking for cover.

02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:10.104
Because one didn't know where
the shots were coming...

02:04:17.310 --> 02:04:18.982
Mr. Wilson!

02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:20.626
Good morning.

02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:23.384
Hello, Mr. Wilson.

02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:25.706
We were just telling a little story...

02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:29.545
...about an outlaw passed through
this way a while back.

02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:31.866
I don't suppose you'd know
about him but...

02:04:32.110 --> 02:04:36.183
These 2 fellows down here is
Texas Rangers.

02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:40.219
Been on his trail, along with this
other fellow over here.

02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:42.421
What did you say your name was, friend?

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:48.546
Fletcher.

02:04:49.710 --> 02:04:51.860
That's right, Mr. Fletcher.

02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:54.904
Anyway, they've been chasing
this outlaw...

02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:59.143
...and it just so happens old Ten Spot
here knows all about it.

02:04:59.390 --> 02:05:00.743
Yes, sir.

02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:04.699
It was down in Monterey, Mexico,
a little while back.

02:05:05.150 --> 02:05:06.788
Anyway, this outlaw fellow...

02:05:07.190 --> 02:05:09.624
...he went up against 5 pistoleros.

02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:12.868
He got 3 of them
before they cut him down.

02:05:13.470 --> 02:05:14.744
Is that right, Miss Rose?

02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:17.743
That's right. His name was...

02:05:18.710 --> 02:05:19.984
...Josey Wales.

02:05:20.230 --> 02:05:23.142
Yeah, that's it. Josey Wales.

02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:28.269
If that's what happened,
then Josey Wales must be dead.

02:05:29.710 --> 02:05:31.143
He is dead.

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:34.423
He sure is dead.

02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:38.658
Dead, all right.

02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:45.348
Will you sign this affidavit?

02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:48.629
Sign? I sure will.

02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:05.784
That's it.

02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:15.341
Nice seeing you, Mr. Wilson.

02:06:21.110 --> 02:06:23.704
Must be 5000 lawmen
in Texas right now.

02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:24.939
Can't get them all.

02:06:25.190 --> 02:06:27.181
I guess that's the truth.

02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:30.379
You fellows get back
up this way, stop in.

02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:33.224
I reckon we won't be coming
back this way.

02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:41.228
I don't believe that story
about Josey Wales.

02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:42.698
You don't?

02:06:43.150 --> 02:06:44.868
No, sir, I don't.

02:06:45.590 --> 02:06:49.503
I don't believe no 5 pistoleros
could do in Josey Wales.

02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:52.182
Maybe it was 6.

02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:53.829
Could have even been 10.

02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:56.823
I think he's still alive.

02:06:57.070 --> 02:06:59.425
Alive? No sir.

02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:10.105
I think I'll go down to Mexico
to try to find him.

02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:18.985
And then?

02:07:27.590 --> 02:07:29.660
He's got the first move.

02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:31.789
I owe him that.

02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:35.940
I'll try to tell him the war is over.

02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:53.178
What do you say?

02:08:00.630 --> 02:08:02.188
I reckon so.

02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:11.743
I guess we all died a little
in that damn war.
