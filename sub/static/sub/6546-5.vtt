00:01.294 --> 00:02.374
Nathan: Previously on Haven...

00:02.461 --> 00:04.292
- Found your adoption file
where you hid it

00:04.380 --> 00:05.460
with Cabot's journal.

00:05.548 --> 00:08.631
- I hid it so you wouldn't know
that I was from the other side,

00:08.718 --> 00:11.209
so you wouldn't force me
to that cave against my will.

00:11.304 --> 00:12.293
(gasping)

00:13.472 --> 00:15.133
- What happened in the cave?

00:15.224 --> 00:17.215
- Something terrible
came through that door.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.636
- I'm so sorry, Audrey.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.434
- Don't talk to Mara.
Talk to me.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.136
It's the only way
that I can fight her.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.222
- You need to stop
talking to Mara.

00:24.317 --> 00:26.057
You need to
treat her like Audrey.

00:26.152 --> 00:27.983
- We're here for you, Audrey.
- I know you can hear me.

00:28.070 --> 00:29.571
- We need you.
- She's been lying.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.441
She can only put them in.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.194
So Audrey was rattling
around inside of me.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.947
I'm going to kill
that bitch right now.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.071
(fork tapping)

00:42.752 --> 00:43.741
(shattering)

00:43.836 --> 00:45.622
- Nope.
Still don't like pancakes.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.504
You know what your big
problem with your

00:48.591 --> 00:52.834
"treat me like Audrey
so Audrey returns" strategy is?

00:52.929 --> 00:56.547
Well, besides the fact
that I killed her,

00:56.641 --> 00:58.632
is it requires I get utensils.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.968
You want to have
another dance?

01:02.313 --> 01:03.769
- Not at the moment, Parker.

01:03.856 --> 01:04.845
- Good idea.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.234
You know
what I will take, though?

01:07.318 --> 01:09.104
One of those tacos.

01:09.195 --> 01:10.685
They taste like the bottom
of that dock,

01:10.780 --> 01:13.066
but I actually prefer
that kind of a flavor.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.613
- I have an idea.
Mara: Hmm.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.157
- We could force-feed
you your pancakes.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.531
- Get close to my mouth,
and I'll bite you too.

01:19.622 --> 01:20.611
(utensil clatters)

01:21.540 --> 01:23.747
- Yeah, that's fine, 'cause we can
just feed you through another--

01:23.834 --> 01:24.823
- Duke.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.794
Let's talk outside.

01:29.507 --> 01:30.792
- Sure.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.626
J‘J‘

01:35.721 --> 01:38.383
(scoffs)
What?

01:40.977 --> 01:43.514
- We can't let her
get to us.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.811
Treating Mara
like Audrey is the only thing

01:45.898 --> 01:47.763
that's brought Audrey back.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.143
- Yeah, that was before
Mara knew

01:49.235 --> 01:50.520
that Audrey
was still in there,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.112
but now Mara knows.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.146
Look, Nathan...

01:55.241 --> 01:56.230
(sighs)

01:56.575 --> 01:58.531
What if Audrey really is gone?

01:58.619 --> 02:01.110
- What if she's not?

02:01.914 --> 02:03.529
(scoffs)
- Okay, fine.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.825
But I'm telling you,
I have gone as far as I can

02:06.919 --> 02:07.908
treating that...

02:09.088 --> 02:10.294
b-i-t-c-h like Audrey.

02:12.258 --> 02:15.000
- We can go further.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.625
Come on.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.715
- Oh, great.

02:19.265 --> 02:23.178
DeeJay: You're listening
to WQDN, 94.7 F.M.--

02:23.269 --> 02:25.260
North Carolina's
best country music station.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.732
(news theme plays)

02:28.816 --> 02:30.317
man: North Carolina weather
this morning

02:30.401 --> 02:31.732
will be unseasonably cool.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.185
Surf in the outer banks
running two to three feet.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.315
And in other news,

02:35.406 --> 02:37.271
the Tar Heels continue
their winning streak.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.607
Stay tu--
(car and radio shut off)

02:39.702 --> 02:40.691
(sighing)

02:44.457 --> 02:45.446
(papers rustling)

02:46.667 --> 02:48.168
- Why "Croatoan"?

02:52.048 --> 02:54.710
J‘J‘

02:54.800 --> 02:57.963
(chatter)

03:03.309 --> 03:04.924
- Find what
you're looking for?

03:05.019 --> 03:07.010
- Uh, oh, not yet.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.437
How long has the historical
society doubled as a diner?

03:11.192 --> 03:12.807
- Since as long
as I can remember.

03:12.902 --> 03:17.066
- And why is it called
the Old Croatoan Cafe?

03:17.990 --> 03:19.275
- Do you know the legend?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.403
- Well, I've, uh, done
some research.

03:21.494 --> 03:23.030
Uh... Oh.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.453
In 1587, some colonists
were left at their settlement

03:26.540 --> 03:27.916
here on Roanoke Island

03:28.000 --> 03:30.241
while their leader went
to England for provisions.

03:30.336 --> 03:34.454
But when he returned,
the settlement was abandoned...

03:34.548 --> 03:35.833
no clues, no bodies,

03:35.925 --> 03:37.756
every single settler gone,

03:37.843 --> 03:39.629
wiped from the earth,
except"

03:40.513 --> 03:43.550
- One clue-- the word "Croatoan"
carved in a tree.

03:43.641 --> 03:46.007
- Yes.
- People love the story.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.888
I'm the owner, Allison Doohan.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.009
- Oh, well...

03:49.105 --> 03:50.595
Good morning.
Vince Teagues.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.770
- First time in Manteo?

03:52.858 --> 03:55.395
- That it is.
I'm a reporter from Haven, Maine.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.602
Been working on a
little human-interest story

03:57.696 --> 03:59.277
about two brothers.

03:59.365 --> 04:02.949
One of them hails from here,
and the other from Haven.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.616
- What's
the local family's name?

04:04.703 --> 04:06.830
- No idea.
That's why I'm here.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.996
Hoping to find some
answers.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.244
- I'm sorry, but I don't
recall ever hearing any stories

04:11.335 --> 04:12.836
- about two brothers.
- Oh.

04:14.547 --> 04:15.878
Well, if you'll excuse me,

04:15.965 --> 04:17.956
I better look after
some of my other customers.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.210
Let me know
if you need anything.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.464
- Oh, you know,

04:26.559 --> 04:29.141
I think I might, uh,
have a cup of coffee

04:29.228 --> 04:30.638
before I get started.

04:30.729 --> 04:31.718
- One sec.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.521
- Oh.
(chuckles)

04:37.236 --> 04:38.225
- Thanks, Vincent.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.270
Be late, make me pay
for the coffee.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.439
(loud chatter)

04:44.743 --> 04:47.405
And you don't even get
us a table.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.871
Buy your own damn
coffee when you get here.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.459
Excuse me.
Hey, Bob...

04:53.210 --> 04:55.292
Free coffee.
excuse me.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.953
Oh!

04:58.340 --> 04:59.841
For the love of Pete.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.836
(whooshing)

05:07.266 --> 05:08.255
Vince: What...

05:09.560 --> 05:10.549
What the...

05:12.480 --> 05:14.766
Wha--

05:16.317 --> 05:17.898
No..-

05:17.985 --> 05:18.974
No.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.521
[IE]

05:20.613 --> 05:23.104
Vince?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.819
What the hell am I doing
in Vince's body?

05:30.539 --> 05:31.528
Dave: "Dave"?

05:34.126 --> 05:35.286
Dave?

05:38.797 --> 05:39.957
What have you done?

05:40.049 --> 05:44.509
J‘J‘

06:11.330 --> 06:16.245
J‘J‘

06:17.753 --> 06:18.742
Allison: You--you okay?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.749
Do you still want
that cup of coffee?

06:21.840 --> 06:22.829
- "Croatoan."

06:23.551 --> 06:24.836
Why does it say that?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.883
- The lost Roanoke Colony.

06:26.971 --> 06:29.007
- Remember?
- Roanoke Colony?

06:30.182 --> 06:31.968
Where the hell am I?

06:32.142 --> 06:33.848
- Manteo, North Carolina.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.514
- Oh, excuse me.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.563
(thuds)
Oh... Oh.

06:48.701 --> 06:49.986
(chuckles awkwardly)

07:01.005 --> 07:02.586
- What did you do, Dave?

07:02.673 --> 07:04.789
If I wasn't in here,
I'd wring your neck!

07:04.883 --> 07:07.169
- Doing your morning affirmation
in the mirror there,

07:07.261 --> 07:08.341
are we, Dave?

07:08.429 --> 07:11.341
- Oh, yeah.
l-l mean, no.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.969
- Yeah. So how is
the information coming along

07:14.059 --> 07:16.471
- from Cincinnati?
- Cincinnati?

07:16.562 --> 07:18.143
- Yeah, I'm still waiting for it.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.141
(stammers)
Dave.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.723
If you're using that
wacky tobacky medically,

07:22.818 --> 07:24.228
go easy on that stuff.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.442
- Have you noticed anything
or anyone acting strange?

07:28.532 --> 07:30.318
- Besides you?
No.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.945
But it's Haven,
and the day is young.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.742
Bye, Dave.
Good not talking to you.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.366
Oh, boy.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.412
J‘J‘

07:46.592 --> 07:48.253
- Here are your pills, Bill.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.130
- And these are for you.
man: Give it to me!

07:54.266 --> 07:58.225
J‘J‘

07:58.312 --> 07:59.347
- Barry, what are you doing?

07:59.438 --> 08:02.020
- No!
- Stop!

08:03.317 --> 08:05.478
I'm okay, Jeffrey.
Just go back to your room.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.560
- What are you doing to me?
(choking)

08:07.655 --> 08:09.441
- Barry, stop it!

08:09.531 --> 08:10.737
- What's happening?
- Barry!

08:13.077 --> 08:14.942
- Barry, stop it.
You're killing him.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.079
J‘J‘

08:19.166 --> 08:20.326
Barry!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.453
- I can't breathe.
man: Watch out, step back!

08:22.544 --> 08:24.409
- I can't breathe!
woman: What's happening?

08:24.505 --> 08:25.494
Help him!

08:26.131 --> 08:27.917
- Barry!
woman: Everybody stay calm.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.462
man: Check his pulse.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.756
- We're done treating you
like Audrey.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.227
- No more food, no more chat.
Mara: Good.

08:39.311 --> 08:42.144
'Cause you
made her fat and boring.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.521
Oh, that's right--

08:47.486 --> 08:49.693
- Then you're going to help us
solve a Trouble.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.571
- Uh, 'scuse me.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.617
Nathan, can I just see you
over here for a second, please?

09:02.543 --> 09:04.499
Um, okay, so I'm sorry.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.998
I thought we were gonna
play it cool

09:07.089 --> 09:10.001
and treat her like Audrey.
Or did--

09:10.092 --> 09:12.299
- We are.
We're taking her on a case.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.760
- Her-- who "her"?

09:15.347 --> 09:18.714
- Mara?
- Yeah.

09:19.143 --> 09:20.804
Mara knows that we're treating
her like Audrey,

09:20.894 --> 09:22.270
and she's fighting us.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.764
So we need a way
to treat her like Audrey

09:23.856 --> 09:25.471
without Mara realizing
what we're doing.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.648
Getting her on a
Trouble case is a way to do that.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.851
- 'Cause Audrey's at her best
when she's helping the Troubled.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.436
- So we put her in a position
to do that again.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.691
If Mara doesn't know
what we're up to,

09:33.782 --> 09:36.159
maybe Audrey
can sneak up on her.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.405
I don't want to cuff her, but we
need a way to keep this safe.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.754
- I may have an idea.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.500
- Then all we need
is a case.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.832
- Barry was such
a pussycat...

09:52.926 --> 09:55.303
till he choked
the life out of this patient.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.469
I can't understand why
he would do this.

09:57.556 --> 10:01.265
- Anybody see anything?
- Yeah, all of them.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.433
- You'd think a psych ward would
do bigger business in Haven.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.509
(laughing)
- Yeah.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.806
Well, we better
get these guys to the morgue.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.641
J‘J‘

10:10.736 --> 10:12.226
man: Gloria, are you okay?

10:19.828 --> 10:21.329
- Chief, are you okay?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.821
Dwight: I need a minute.
- Okay.

10:23.916 --> 10:24.951
Take as much
time as you want.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.374
I mean, this place, it's...
it's upsetting.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.535
Dwight: Yeah.
Sure is.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.505
(groans)

10:33.592 --> 10:37.130
Uh...

10:44.937 --> 10:46.268
Huh.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.681
Uh...

10:51.777 --> 10:53.187
we need to talk.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.441
- Ya think?

10:57.783 --> 10:58.863
Oh.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.487
- Oh, God.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.532
(police radio chatter)

11:04.623 --> 11:06.033
man: Yeah, we got about
an hour here...

11:06.124 --> 11:07.705
- So you're actually Dwight?

11:07.793 --> 11:09.408
- Yeah.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.835
I'm not happy
about this Trouble, Nathan.

11:12.965 --> 11:16.378
- I'm not exactly jumping
forjoy either there, kiddo.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.299
- But you don't know
what happened?

11:18.387 --> 11:20.548
How-- what caused this?

11:20.639 --> 11:23.051
- No. We were just working
the crime scene together.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.677
J‘J‘

11:24.768 --> 11:28.727
(sighs)
- I never realized how short I am.

11:28.814 --> 11:29.803
Huh.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.764
By the way...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.850
you are all muscle,
big guy.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.068
What do you eat?

11:36.154 --> 11:38.361
- You know, you could pay
a visit to the gym, Gloria.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.279
- Oh, yeah.
I'll get right on that.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.868
Nathan: Guys.
- Oh Goll...

11:41.952 --> 11:42.941
- Dwight.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.193
- Dwight?
- Yes.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.197
- I'm bringing
Mara on this case.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.074
- Arrest him.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.164
- What?
- Fine.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.166
Then just punch him
in the head till he falls down.

11:55.257 --> 11:59.091
- I'll arrest him.
- Dwight...

11:59.177 --> 12:00.166
It's safe.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.386
Duke, for once,
had a good idea.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.929
Picked up a stun belt
from the courthouse.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.973
I hit this button,
50,000 volts of electricity

12:07.060 --> 12:09.051
goes into her kidneys--
she's down.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.683
- You better know
what you're doing, man.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.901
- Audrey Parker has helped
this town more than anyone.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.316
Helped people with Troubles--

12:16.403 --> 12:19.486
Troubles like you... have.

12:19.573 --> 12:23.907
J‘J‘

12:23.994 --> 12:26.201
Just, um, wait here.

12:26.288 --> 12:29.451
- It's actually not funny,
Nathan.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.086
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.499
- Really?

12:42.763 --> 12:43.752
A jacket.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.348
Oh. And a badge.

12:46.516 --> 12:49.474
I thought you had given up
treating me like Audrey.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.550
- I have.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.847
But if you're gonna help
solve this Trouble,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.728
people are
gonna ask questions.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.391
- So...

12:59.404 --> 13:01.816
How about I get a gun?

13:01.907 --> 13:05.149
- How about I start hitting
the button on this thing?

13:08.956 --> 13:09.945
J‘J‘

13:10.040 --> 13:12.156
Gloria: Look, Gloria, I really don't
think you should be carrying...

13:12.250 --> 13:15.242
- Okay, so what?
We got two dead bodies and...

13:16.421 --> 13:17.456
Dwight: Your glutes.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.753
Those two switched?

13:18.924 --> 13:21.085
(laughing)

13:21.176 --> 13:22.677
Nathan: Yeah.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.501
- Oh, wow.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.461
- You know how this works?
- Well, you plant a seed,

13:26.556 --> 13:30.299
but you never know exactly
how the vine's gonna grow.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.884
- Can you help us?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.352
What should we do?

13:34.439 --> 13:35.428
- Run...

13:36.233 --> 13:39.566
That is, if you want
to stay alive.

13:39.653 --> 13:44.943
J‘J‘

13:48.245 --> 13:51.157
(breathing heavily)

13:58.213 --> 14:00.169
(car alarm chirps)

14:01.258 --> 14:02.247
- Oh.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.799
When he's alone,
he rents premium.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.627
(gasps)

14:14.980 --> 14:16.436
What's this doing here?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.313
- Oh, jeez.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.987
What the hell is that?

14:30.912 --> 14:32.652
(groaning, cell phone ringing)

14:41.757 --> 14:42.997
What have you done, Dave?

14:43.091 --> 14:45.002
- Me? Me?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.549
What have you done?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.422
- I didn't do anything.
You did this!

14:48.513 --> 14:50.344
- Why on earth
would I ever do this?

14:50.432 --> 14:51.717
And what is this?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.220
- Some kind of Trouble,
I'm sure.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.597
But why it's happening
to us right now, I have no idea.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.519
- Here's a guess--

14:58.607 --> 15:00.518
because you're in Manteo,
North Carolina,

15:00.609 --> 15:04.022
with my adoption file
researching me, Vincent.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.613
- I have a good reason
for that.

15:05.697 --> 15:09.064
Our therapist scrawled
the word "Croatoan" on a pad

15:09.159 --> 15:11.070
after hypnotizing you.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.776
That's from Roanoke,

15:12.871 --> 15:15.283
a nearby English colony
that was wiped out.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.035
We need to find
where you're really from.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.117
It could help
with the Troubles...

15:20.212 --> 15:21.372
all the Troubles.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.495
This Trouble.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.672
- I can't believe
you took my adoption file.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.545
- Leave the file alone, Dave!

15:28.553 --> 15:30.544
Now, I'm coming down
there right now.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.846
Don't do anything stupid.
(cell phone beeps)

15:35.018 --> 15:36.883
(cell phone beeping)

15:38.146 --> 15:39.522
woman: There wasn't any animosity

15:39.606 --> 15:41.142
or even a relationship
that I know of

15:41.233 --> 15:42.973
between Barry and Hopkins.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.940
- So why would Barry
choke him to death?

15:48.031 --> 15:50.989
- Hopkins was a monster,
but Barry...

15:51.993 --> 15:53.779
I can't imagine
why he'd attack.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.577
- It makes no sense.
- I don't get it either.

15:57.582 --> 16:00.665
Maybe Barry was just
defending himself?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.959
- Not the way I saw it.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.035
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:04.131 --> 16:05.712
I should really go check
on the patients.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.179
J‘J‘

16:14.266 --> 16:16.257
(whispers)
- Hopkins was Barry.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.146
They switched bodies.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.183
- Parker.

16:28.613 --> 16:29.602
You're alive.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.729
- Barely.
- Hey.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.869
- Please keep treating
me like Audrey.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.113
- Okay.
- Keep treating me like her.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.035
- I will.
How?

16:38.123 --> 16:39.533
Is there anything I can do?

16:39.624 --> 16:41.125
- Everything.
Keep doing everything.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.240
- Okay.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.200
- Hey, Parker, stay with me.
- Okay.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.536
- Stay with me.
- Don't--don't--

16:45.630 --> 16:48.212
don't let her know
that I was here.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.292
Please don't
tell her that I was--

16:51.386 --> 16:52.592
that I was here.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.140
(sighs)

16:59.978 --> 17:00.967
(scoffs)

17:02.272 --> 17:03.307
What idiots.

17:04.608 --> 17:08.647
It says here that schizophrenia
is... hereditary.

17:08.737 --> 17:09.817
Uh, hello?

17:09.905 --> 17:11.111
Isn't everything hereditary?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.867
(exhales sharply)
I'm tired.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.113
And you can Tase
me if you want to,

17:18.205 --> 17:20.821
but I am going
to go and take a nap.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.159
(door opens)

17:27.839 --> 17:30.216
(low mower chugs in distance)

17:32.844 --> 17:34.584
Vince: "270 Maywood"...

17:34.679 --> 17:36.089
Well, this is the place.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.814
J‘J‘

17:55.992 --> 17:57.107
Woman: hello.
Can I help you?

17:57.202 --> 17:58.692
- Huh?
(thuds)

17:59.037 --> 18:00.698
(groans)

18:06.378 --> 18:09.461
- Hard to hold a scalpel
with these catcher's mitts.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.629
Lucky I got through
the autopsy.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.958
- Audrey confirmed that these
two are switched, just like us.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.294
- Audrey?
- Yeah. What do you got?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.254
- Bad news.
Look at this.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.724
Oh, gosh, I feel like
I could punch through ceilings

18:26.815 --> 18:28.305
with these things.
(groans)

18:28.984 --> 18:30.190
- And the glasses...

18:30.735 --> 18:33.977
Looks like my face
was taken hostage by the 1980s.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.482
Why didn't anybody tell me?

18:35.573 --> 18:36.562
- Gloria, focus.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.782
- Right.
Well, Barry, the orderly,

18:39.869 --> 18:41.825
- crushed Hopkins' trachea.
- Yeah.

18:41.913 --> 18:45.155
- So Hopkins couldn't breathe
and died of asphyxiation.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.992
And Barry died
of asphyxiation, too.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.122
Only, he shouldn't have.
His trachea was fine.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.919
But he asphyxiated.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.963
- Yeah.
- Don't you get it?

18:54.050 --> 18:56.507
If one switched person dies,
the other dies.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.427
If my body, or should I say,
your body, goes kaput--

18:59.514 --> 19:00.720
- Why would it go kaput?

19:00.807 --> 19:03.549
- Because you have a bullet
Trouble, and I'm not used to it.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.179
So, if I hear shooting...

19:05.270 --> 19:07.511
- If you're close enough
to hear a shot,

19:07.605 --> 19:09.266
we're both dead.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.820
Allison: Not the best day,
am I right?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.317
- You've no idea.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.905
You were at the cafe.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.907
What are you doing here?

19:24.998 --> 19:28.786
- This is my house,
so I basically live here.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.708
What's your excuse?

19:30.795 --> 19:31.784
- Everything okay?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.464
-Mmmmm.
Yeah, I'm fine, hon.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.163
This is Skip, my husband.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.668
- Mister...
- Dave.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.966
Oh, Vince Teagues.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.128
l was introduced
to your low branch,

19:42.223 --> 19:44.680
and your wife was kind enough
to help.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.383
- Oh, sorry.
I was out back--

19:46.478 --> 19:48.139
you know, never-ending job.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.844
- I have quite a garden
back home.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.851
- Oh, yeah? Where's that?
- Haven, Maine.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.853
- Haven, huh?
Never heard of it.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.684
-Mmmmm.
Mr. Teagues here is writing a story

19:56.780 --> 19:57.986
about two brothers.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.110
- Well, yes.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.533
You see, I'm one
of the two brothers.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.406
- You're one of the brothers?

20:05.497 --> 20:07.988
- The ugly one.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.166
My brother Dave
is from right here-- Manteo.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.241
Handsome devil.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.419
He was adopted.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.495
I'm from Haven.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.708
in his adoption file.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.256
- Oh.
Well, I'm sorry.

20:22.347 --> 20:25.430
I don't know
why it would be in his file.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.554
You see, this property has been
in my family for generations,

20:28.645 --> 20:31.307
and I've never heard
of any adopted relatives.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.433
- Oh.

20:33.525 --> 20:37.268
Well, then I'd better be letting
you get on with your day.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.604
(clears throat)
Sorry to have bothered you.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.158
-Mmmm.

20:50.250 --> 20:54.038
(slurping loudly)

20:55.213 --> 20:56.828
Ohh...
Mmm.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.629
- I try to eat healthy,
Gloria.

20:58.716 --> 21:02.800
-You're like a moose.
A milkshake won't hurt.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.138
- Hi, Gloria.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.962
- Oh, hi, Vickie.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.467
Hi.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.096
- Package came for you earlier.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.437
I promised
I'd get your signature.

21:12.355 --> 21:15.518
J‘J‘

21:15.608 --> 21:17.599
- What are you waiting for?

21:27.120 --> 21:30.863
- Okay.
- Thank you, Vickie.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.369
- So, uh,
what's in Cincinnati?

21:33.460 --> 21:35.496
- None of your business.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.077
- Where are you going?

21:38.715 --> 21:39.921
- To the ladies' room.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.669
Hmm.

21:46.097 --> 21:47.257
- Woah.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.473
Dave: Hello, Dave.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.265
- Vince, you scared the tar
out of me!

21:54.355 --> 21:55.561
- What did
you do to my head?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.104
- Me?

21:57.192 --> 22:00.559
I don't know how you maintain
consciousness at this altitude.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.440
- Well, at least I don't have
an infection on my leg.

22:08.119 --> 22:11.862
J‘J‘

22:11.956 --> 22:13.116
This needs to end.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.914
- Ag reed.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.743
-Well... we'll have to operate
as each other.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.623
Find out what
we can down here.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.375
It must all be connected.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.048
- Operate as each other.

22:24.135 --> 22:27.377
You mean I get to sneak around
behind my brother's back?

22:27.472 --> 22:30.384
- Please. You hide from me
that you're from another world

22:30.475 --> 22:31.965
for 60 years?

22:34.270 --> 22:38.104
Now, have you discovered
anything useful down here?

22:38.191 --> 22:41.228
(sighs)
- There was an address in the adoption file.

22:41.319 --> 22:44.061
The property's been
in the same family for decades.

22:44.155 --> 22:46.237
The current owner of record

22:46.324 --> 22:48.906
also runs the Croatoan Cafe.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.654
She doesn't know anything.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.201
- Does she not know anything,

22:52.288 --> 22:54.950
or is she not telling you
anything, Dave?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.786
- I'm exhausted--

22:59.837 --> 23:01.623
- all the traveling.
- The traveling, yeah.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.454
I'm the one who flew
down here twice.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.633
Second time
on a discount airline.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.630
And why are you
on the no-fly list?

23:08.721 --> 23:10.973
I was in security
for half an hour.

23:11.057 --> 23:15.426
- Can you not be a martyr
for one minute, Vincent?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.509
- Fine.

23:16.604 --> 23:17.935
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.558
We'll go back
to the Croatoan Cafe,

23:19.649 --> 23:20.729
see what we can find.

23:20.817 --> 23:21.977
And by the way,

23:22.068 --> 23:25.435
the cut on your leg...
really hurts.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.111
- Well, have you put
anything on it?

23:27.198 --> 23:28.779
- A band-aid.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.323
You owe me $3.95.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.400
(scoffs)

23:34.372 --> 23:35.532
(engine turning over)

23:48.636 --> 23:49.625
(groaning)

23:51.806 --> 23:53.091
mm

23:56.227 --> 23:57.558
Nathan: You okay?

23:57.645 --> 23:58.805
- You really should
appreciate the fact

23:58.896 --> 23:59.931
that you can't feel anything.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.935
- How long till you need
to let out a Trouble?

24:04.027 --> 24:07.770
- Well, you know, it's not like
I can look it up on WebMD.

24:07.864 --> 24:08.853
(sighs)

24:10.074 --> 24:11.063
(groans)

24:11.826 --> 24:13.032
Okay.
So, uh...

24:14.787 --> 24:16.652
(sighs)
What's going on here?

24:16.748 --> 24:18.204
If one of the switched
people dies,

24:18.291 --> 24:20.498
then so does
the other switched person?

24:20.585 --> 24:22.075
- Apparently, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.001
And why Dwight and Gloria?

24:24.088 --> 24:26.124
Was it proximity

24:26.215 --> 24:28.080
or last person you touched?

24:28.176 --> 24:29.541
- I don't know.

24:34.766 --> 24:35.755
(scoffs)

24:36.517 --> 24:40.510
Sure could use Audrey
right now.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.436
Nathan: Yeah.
Duke: Are you sure we're doing enough

24:42.523 --> 24:43.899
to bring her back?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.224
- I'm doing everything I can.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.355
- Nathan, we're supposed
to treat her like Audrey,

24:48.446 --> 24:49.856
and you got her
chained to a bed.

24:49.947 --> 24:50.936
I'm pretty sure
that's not

24:51.032 --> 24:52.988
how you and Audrey
spent your evenings.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.816
And if it is,
please forgive me.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.447
l-l'm impressed.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.239
(groaning)

25:04.253 --> 25:05.459
- You're getting worse.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.045
- Yup...

25:08.132 --> 25:10.168
- You think if we bring Audrey
back, she could help you?

25:10.259 --> 25:13.046
- I mean, the thought
did cross my mind, yeah.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.297
(whispering)
Audrey: It's secrets.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.056
- Parker...

25:21.521 --> 25:22.727
(waves lapping, sighing)

25:24.565 --> 25:28.353
- You switch with someone
you have a big secret with.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.945
Mara thought about that.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.399
- Wait.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.356
Dwight and Gloria
have a secret?

25:36.744 --> 25:37.733
- Parker...

25:38.705 --> 25:40.570
how are you doing this?

25:40.665 --> 25:43.577
- I don't know.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.579
I think it's easier
when Mara's sleeping.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.127
- Okay, so we need to--
- Nathan,

25:49.215 --> 25:52.173
you can't take me
on the case with you tomorrow.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.249
- What?

25:53.344 --> 25:54.959
- Mara's getting suspicious.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.840
I know what she's thinking.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.089
And the harder you try,

25:59.183 --> 26:01.595
the more her defenses go up.

26:01.686 --> 26:03.267
It's just...

26:03.354 --> 26:04.855
(sighs)
It's getting worse.

26:06.274 --> 26:09.607
- How am I supposed
to treat you like Audrey, then?

26:10.027 --> 26:11.233
- Leave me here.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.228
Duke...

26:15.533 --> 26:17.023
Duke, you can do it.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.071
You have to do it, Duke.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.616
- Parker. Audrey.

26:22.707 --> 26:23.696
Stay.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.245
- You need to do it.

26:26.335 --> 26:30.795
J‘J‘

26:32.675 --> 26:36.418
(WQDN playing)

26:37.638 --> 26:39.674
Allison: I'm going to the post office.
Back in a bit.

26:52.445 --> 26:57.565
J‘J‘

27:03.206 --> 27:05.538
(keys clacking)

27:05.625 --> 27:06.614
(computer beeps)

27:22.600 --> 27:26.263
J‘J‘

27:37.907 --> 27:39.568
- Where's the cop?

27:39.659 --> 27:40.648
(chuckles)

27:43.538 --> 27:46.245
- He's out cleaning up
one of your little presents.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.321
- Mm.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.916
And you stayed out of it?

27:51.003 --> 27:53.039
Interesting.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.836
- Yeah, I've noticed
that you seem to find me

27:54.924 --> 27:56.130
very interesting, Mara.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.301
-Hmm.
Any guesses why?

28:00.429 --> 28:02.465
- I have my theories.
- Really?

28:02.557 --> 28:05.720
Well, then you
should illuminate me.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.765
- Well, you have all
of Audrey's memories, right?

28:09.856 --> 28:10.845
- Yes.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.062
- So you remember
you and Nathan.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.733
- Yes.

28:16.821 --> 28:17.810
- You remember...

28:20.199 --> 28:21.405
you and me.

28:23.828 --> 28:24.817
- Yeah.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.372
- Remember the first time
we met?

28:29.458 --> 28:31.995
I pulled you
out of the drink.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.668
Brought you back to
the Cape Rouge,

28:34.755 --> 28:38.498
dried your clothes,
made you breakfast.

28:44.348 --> 28:47.465
And I remember
when you walked away, Audrey.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.518
- I looked over my shoulder.

28:50.605 --> 28:52.220
- Yeah.

28:52.315 --> 28:53.304
- Yeah.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.431
- Audrey...

28:57.320 --> 29:01.188
Remember that night
in the hotel in Colorado?

29:05.286 --> 29:08.278
J‘J‘

29:08.372 --> 29:09.407
- Yeah.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.039
- Audrey?

29:18.633 --> 29:20.419
- Duke.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.498
Hey...

29:22.386 --> 29:24.877
- Okay.
- Hi.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.212
(rattling)

29:26.307 --> 29:27.888
Hi.
- Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.

29:29.226 --> 29:30.932
Well, hi.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.135
(laughs)

29:32.229 --> 29:33.639
- Let me just
keep talking to you.

29:33.731 --> 29:34.766
- Okay.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.472
- Come on,
let's just--

29:36.567 --> 29:38.774
let's just
keep doing this.

29:38.861 --> 29:40.397
- Okay.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.239
- Mmm. Mmm.

29:50.581 --> 29:51.570
Oh.

29:53.584 --> 29:54.573
What?

29:55.711 --> 29:56.700
(sighs)

29:57.505 --> 29:59.541
- Uh, I wouldn't do that,
Dwight,

29:59.632 --> 30:04.126
unless you want
heartburn all day.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.255
(sniffs, computer clicks)

30:06.263 --> 30:08.800
Gloria: Okay, this is the security
footage from the Freddy.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.552
Notice how Barry
goes all wobbly

30:10.643 --> 30:12.224
right before the attack.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.176
There, see how he's about
to fall over,

30:14.271 --> 30:15.807
like he lost his balance?

30:15.898 --> 30:18.059
- That's exactly how I felt
when we switched.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.811
- Me too.
Barry: Give it to me!

30:19.902 --> 30:21.187
- I don't know
who's causing this Trouble,

30:21.278 --> 30:23.940
but Audrey said that you switch
with a person

30:24.031 --> 30:25.737
you're keeping a secret from.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.440
- I'm an open book.
- I got nothing.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.275
Barry: What are you doing to me?
woman: Barry, stop!

30:29.370 --> 30:31.861
- Time to visit
the Freddy again.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.116
- All right,
I'll come with you.

30:33.207 --> 30:34.367
- Me too.

30:37.128 --> 30:39.084
- I don't think
that's such a good idea.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.036
You're slow.

30:41.132 --> 30:42.793
And you're a danger
to the public.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.335
- Fine. We'll just stay here
and run names

30:48.431 --> 30:50.296
and backgrounds on patients.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.435
(sighs)

30:53.519 --> 30:55.555
- Ah, ah, ah.

30:55.646 --> 30:56.635
- Oh, God.

30:57.565 --> 31:00.398
Fine. Tell me about
chamomile tea, Gloria.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.600
- Oh, it's lovely.

31:02.695 --> 31:03.935
But gin's better.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.239
- Dave--
(thudding, Vince groaning)

31:12.329 --> 31:13.489
Watch my head.

31:14.498 --> 31:19.242
- Tell me you found
something useful.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.746
Now you're writing on me?

31:20.838 --> 31:24.956
- It'll come off.
Look at the area code, you dimwit.

31:26.594 --> 31:27.800
- Haven?

31:27.887 --> 31:28.876
Where'd you get this?

31:28.971 --> 31:31.633
- On a piece of paper
on Allison's desk.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.715
But I waited for
you before dialing.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.720
- Oh, that was thoughtful.
Thank you.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.188
- We're brothers, Dave.

31:38.272 --> 31:40.228
I don't like keeping things
from you.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.305
(phone beeping)

31:42.610 --> 31:44.726
- I never intended to hide
all this from you,

31:44.820 --> 31:46.196
but I was just...

31:47.198 --> 31:49.655
(Vince sighs)
- What, Dave?

31:49.742 --> 31:51.027
- Scared, okay?

31:51.952 --> 31:54.238
Scared of discovering
the truth.

31:54.330 --> 31:57.163
- The truth about what?
- Me.

32:01.504 --> 32:03.790
- Well, let's see
who answers.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.917
Maybe it has something to do
with your past.

32:06.509 --> 32:07.498
(phone ringing)

32:07.593 --> 32:10.676
woman: Frederickson's psychiatric
facility, nurse's station.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.469
- The Freddy in Haven, Maine?

32:12.556 --> 32:15.093
woman: Yes. Can I help you?

32:15.184 --> 32:17.300
- Uh, no.
(cell phone beeps)

32:17.394 --> 32:19.851
- What is someone
from down here in North Carolina

32:19.939 --> 32:22.976
doing calling
Haven's mental institution?

32:23.067 --> 32:25.979
- Dave, I think it's time
we called home.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.861
- You guys switched and
didn't tell anybody?

32:33.953 --> 32:36.194
- We didn't even know
where it started. Down here...

32:36.288 --> 32:37.277
- Or up there.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.329
- Well, we were both
at the Freddy when it happened,

32:39.416 --> 32:41.156
but neither of you were.

32:41.252 --> 32:44.585
- We were actually 850 miles
away from each other.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.458
- And the phone
number on Allison's desk

32:46.549 --> 32:48.255
cannot be a coincidence.

32:48.342 --> 32:49.673
- Well, we'll just
recheck the list

32:49.760 --> 32:51.466
of Freddy employees
and patients.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.715
Look for a connection
between here and Manteo.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.342
Keep your phones on.

32:55.432 --> 32:56.421
(computer beeps)

32:56.517 --> 32:57.506
MEI!

32:58.602 --> 33:00.103
- You know,
I make a pretty good cop.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.429
- Ah, the jury's still out.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.768
-Hmm.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.863
Duke: After I salvaged your rental car...
- Uh-huh.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.858
- I sold it.
(laughing)

33:11.949 --> 33:13.860
And I kept the reward money.

33:13.951 --> 33:16.283
(laughing)
- I can't believe you did that.

33:17.538 --> 33:18.778
(chuckles)

33:20.749 --> 33:21.738
(sighs)
- Duke.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.371
I want to get out of bed.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.714
- I want to-l want to be Audrey again.
- No, wait-- wait, wait.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.289
I don't-l don't think
that's a good idea.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.215
- But I feel good.

33:32.303 --> 33:34.885
I feel like this is--
this is really working.

33:34.972 --> 33:37.054
- Exactly...
- Mm.

33:37.141 --> 33:39.132
- Which is why
we should just keep doing it.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.682
(sighs)
- Okay.

33:42.813 --> 33:43.802
Just"

33:45.566 --> 33:46.555
don't leave.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.309
Okay?
Please don't.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.733
- I won't.

33:53.908 --> 33:54.897
- Duke...

33:57.161 --> 33:58.742
can I ask you a question?

33:58.829 --> 34:00.569
- Anything.

34:00.664 --> 34:01.915
- In Colorado...

34:03.500 --> 34:05.001
Why did you stop?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.160
- What do you mean?
- We were kissing.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.373
And you stopped.

34:12.468 --> 34:13.457
(exhales sharply)

34:15.179 --> 34:16.794
- I was just following
your lead.

34:16.889 --> 34:20.256
- No.

34:20.351 --> 34:21.682
No.

34:21.769 --> 34:24.306
I pulled away because I knew
you wanted to stop.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.557
lsensediL
and I always just--

34:26.649 --> 34:28.640
I never understood why.

34:29.693 --> 34:32.776
J‘J‘

34:32.863 --> 34:35.445
- We found one name at the
Freddy who comes from Manteo--

34:35.532 --> 34:38.023
longtime patient,
last name Doohan.

34:38.118 --> 34:42.782
- Allison Doohan owns
the Old Croatoan Cafe.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.113
Her husband is Skip.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.823
- This patient's name...

34:46.877 --> 34:48.253
is Jeffrey Doohan.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.794
- Skip's brother maybe?

34:52.967 --> 34:55.299
- Allison must have made
the call.

34:55.386 --> 34:56.796
- Well, Nathan's
at the Freddy now.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.548
I'll get him to check
this Jeffrey out.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.472
Vince: Tell him to hurry up.
Dave: And be careful.

35:01.558 --> 35:02.638
- Great.
(computer beeps)

35:04.061 --> 35:05.767
Why is it I feel
I always gotta pee?

35:05.854 --> 35:07.810
What's that all about?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.809
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.106
- Oh, yes, you do.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.442
woman: Okay, I'll be right back.
(beeps)

35:16.282 --> 35:18.989
- Nurse, Jeffrey Doohan...

35:19.076 --> 35:20.486
is this his room?

35:20.577 --> 35:23.034
- Uh, yes, but I was
just talking to Jeffrey.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.157
He's really upset.

35:24.248 --> 35:25.988
He really needs
his medication right now.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.825
- Okay, well, I'm still gonna
need to talk to him.

35:28.919 --> 35:30.455
- You really
shouldn't go in there-- Please.

35:30.546 --> 35:33.379
- I'm just gonna ask him
a couple questions.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.454
(thuds)

35:36.051 --> 35:37.712
woman: Jeffrey!
- Damn!

35:37.803 --> 35:39.213
man: Jeffrey!

35:39.305 --> 35:40.511
Stay there, man!

35:41.432 --> 35:42.421
man: Jeffrey!

35:42.891 --> 35:44.392
Come on, Jeffrey!
Stop!

35:44.601 --> 35:46.182
(voices fading)

35:46.270 --> 35:47.259
Audrey: Duke.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.805
Duke?

35:53.610 --> 35:55.271
Duke, what's wrong?

36:00.868 --> 36:01.857
Hey.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.038
Hey.

36:06.707 --> 36:07.696
- Audrey?

36:08.125 --> 36:10.457
- Yeah.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.464
- I can't feel.
Oh, this is not good.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.425
You gotta be kidding me.

36:26.477 --> 36:28.092
- What's wrong?

36:28.187 --> 36:30.018
- Nothing.
I just got a little light-headed.

36:31.648 --> 36:32.637
- Okay.

36:34.318 --> 36:35.307
- Should we, um...

36:35.402 --> 36:38.394
- Should we keep talking
about Colorado?

36:39.823 --> 36:40.812
Sure.

36:42.868 --> 36:43.903
- What about it?

36:46.163 --> 36:47.323
- What about it?

36:47.414 --> 36:48.403
(chuckles)

36:50.376 --> 36:52.116
When we kissed...

36:53.921 --> 36:55.912
we knew we had something.
We...

36:57.299 --> 36:58.914
We couldn't deny it.

37:00.844 --> 37:01.833
- No.
- No.

37:04.098 --> 37:06.464
Did you ever tell Nathan?

37:06.558 --> 37:07.547
- No.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.099
- Yeah.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.849
(alarm blaring)

37:20.155 --> 37:21.941
man: Jeffrey!

37:22.032 --> 37:23.238
(exhales sharply)

37:23.325 --> 37:24.565
- Detective?
man: Jeffrey!

37:24.660 --> 37:25.945
- Detective.
man: Have you seen Jeffrey?

37:26.036 --> 37:27.025
Detective!

37:28.247 --> 37:30.579
He's gone.
Jeffrey's gone.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.122
Aren't you going after him?

37:32.209 --> 37:34.416
- Who?
- Jeffrey.

37:34.503 --> 37:35.492
- Yes. Jeffery.

37:37.673 --> 37:40.210
Okay. Thanks.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.128
Thank you.

37:44.555 --> 37:45.965
Thank you.

37:53.147 --> 37:55.058
(cell phone rings)

38:00.904 --> 38:03.520
Come on, Nathan, pick up.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.071
Pick up the phone, Nathan.

38:06.243 --> 38:07.232
(phone beeps)

38:08.245 --> 38:09.234
- Yeah.

38:09.663 --> 38:10.652
- We switched.

38:11.582 --> 38:13.573
- Yeah.
- Be cool...

38:13.667 --> 38:14.873
as cool as you can be,

38:14.960 --> 38:18.248
and step away from her
right now.

38:18.338 --> 38:19.327
- Why?

38:19.423 --> 38:21.664
- Because that
is not Audrey, Nathan.

38:21.758 --> 38:25.046
That is Mara pretending
to be Audrey.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.718
Nathan...
I'm telling you the truth.

38:29.892 --> 38:31.177
- It's Nathan.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.804
I'll be right back.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.927
- Okay.

38:39.902 --> 38:40.891
(breathing heavily)

38:44.656 --> 38:46.192
- Why should I believe you?

38:46.283 --> 38:47.989
- Because it's the truth.

38:48.076 --> 38:51.204
- And what she just told me
about Colorado?

38:51.288 --> 38:52.824
(sighs)

38:58.295 --> 38:59.501
- Uh...

38:59.588 --> 39:02.421
What did-what--
what did she tell you?

39:02.508 --> 39:04.874
- That you kissed,
that you--

39:04.968 --> 39:06.629
- Okay, yes,
the kiss is true,

39:06.720 --> 39:08.881
but everything else
is a lie.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.133
That's how I knew
that it wasn't Audrey.

39:11.225 --> 39:12.385
- What?
- Yes.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.966
Audrey and I...

39:15.187 --> 39:18.179
kissed in Colorado,

39:18.273 --> 39:21.390
but I never told you
because I knew it--

39:21.485 --> 39:22.975
it didn't mean anything.

39:23.737 --> 39:25.443
I could tell
when we were kissing

39:25.531 --> 39:26.862
that it wasn't going
anywhere for us,

39:26.949 --> 39:28.439
probably because of you.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.283
We both knew it,
but we never talked about it.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.738
Butjust now, she just said
it was something,

39:35.832 --> 39:38.084
something that it... wasn't.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.157
And that's...

39:40.212 --> 39:41.918
God, Nat--

39:42.005 --> 39:43.336
(sighs)

39:43.423 --> 39:45.334
You have to believe me,
Nathan.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.381
That is not Audrey.

39:47.469 --> 39:50.757
- Your kiss...

39:50.847 --> 39:52.508
that was our secret.

39:53.517 --> 39:55.929
- That's why we switched.
- I guess.

39:56.019 --> 39:58.010
Kind of hoping we'd
switch back now that it's out,

39:58.105 --> 40:01.438
but I guess that would
be too easy.

40:01.525 --> 40:03.937
- We need to
find Jeffrey Doohan.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.278
His Trouble's causing this.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.485
- That makes sense now.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.279
- How long
has she been pretending?

40:09.366 --> 40:11.778
- I'm guessing since you
took her out of The Gull

40:11.868 --> 40:13.369
and on a case.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.442
- Why?

40:14.538 --> 40:15.618
- To get our guard down,

40:15.706 --> 40:18.038
to-to-to get us
to keep pushing,

40:18.125 --> 40:19.410
keep treating her like Audrey,

40:19.501 --> 40:21.537
and take the cuffs
and the belt off.

40:21.628 --> 40:25.086
She asked me to take them off.
Do not unchain her, Nathan.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.162
Don't.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.874
Whatever you do,
don't unchain her.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.673
(groans)

40:34.308 --> 40:36.048
you...

40:36.143 --> 40:39.135
feel... terrible.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.639
- You feel...

40:40.731 --> 40:41.720
strange.

40:44.234 --> 40:45.349
Damn it.

40:45.444 --> 40:48.436
That's my, uh-- that's my Trouble.
It's getting worse.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.323
I need to--

40:50.407 --> 40:55.026
you need let loose
a Trouble soon.

40:55.912 --> 40:59.530
Vince: I told you already.
I checked it out.

40:59.625 --> 41:03.709
- That was before we knew about
Jeffrey Doohan in the Freddy.

41:03.795 --> 41:04.784
- In Haven.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.545
(breathing heavily)

41:09.301 --> 41:10.882
I don't feel so well.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.802
- I warned you not to eat
that hollandaise sauce.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.470
- I don't know what it is.

41:15.557 --> 41:16.763
(stammering)
I'm...

41:16.850 --> 41:17.839
- Woozy.
- Woozy?

41:18.977 --> 41:20.717
- My ears are ringing.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.894
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.521
- Oh, no.

41:25.609 --> 41:27.520
This might sound crazy,
Vincent,

41:27.611 --> 41:30.102
but do you feel like
water trickling downhill?

41:30.197 --> 41:33.860
- Y-yes, like water
trickling downhill.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.611
- You're walking towards
a thinny!

41:35.702 --> 41:37.158
- What?

41:37.245 --> 41:39.861
- How you feel now is how I felt
that night in the cave.

41:39.956 --> 41:42.288
- What?
- You are walking toward a thinny...

41:43.794 --> 41:45.625
an open one.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.124
(whooshing)

41:49.591 --> 41:52.082
And it wants you back.

41:52.177 --> 41:56.341
J‘J‘

41:58.475 --> 42:02.969
J‘J‘
