Stop it.

00:01.660 --> 00:03.870
Is this because you're turning 50?

00:03.920 --> 00:05.830
Or is it the sign of a guilty conscience?

00:05.880 --> 00:08.480
- I want you to undress me again.
- Sarah, we can't.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.870
Nikki's left me.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.630
I've known for a while there's
another bloke. Find out for me.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.430
There is someone else.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.710
It's you.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.070
I don't recognise you, Jen.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.670
You're not the woman I
married. On either occasion.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.790
Just tell Pete our marriage is over.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.470
- ".. with a sexy blonde who trashed my literary
tastes." - Oh, my God. He's describing me.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.950
A man with intelligence
who's good with his hands.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.270
I contrived it all, Adam,
to get you into bed.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.310
The plan to get even with Tina?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.790

She didn't come all this way

We slept together.

Once.

Well, you could have said no!

I wouldn't know. I'm surprised you do.

01:41.760 --> 01:44.990
I'm going home. You clearly don't
want to share a bed with me.

feeling like this for months.

No, not yet.

Not knowing I've got this bed to myself.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.270

04:11.200 --> 04:13.190
But you couldn't go through with it.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.670
Because of my feelings for you.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.110
Yet you did! At the worst possible
moment, just as the cake was being cut!

04:18.160 --> 04:21.190
You said you'd come and talk to
me. And I waited, but you didn't.

forgotten. I was in a state.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.230
for the Away Day, for...

04:31.280 --> 04:33.280
What?!

04:33.520 --> 04:36.720
Are you telling me that you
posted Tina's sex tape online?

04:41.720 --> 04:44.560
I found it when Jamie
told me about the affair.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.790
I was waiting for the
right moment to use it.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.440
- Jesus, you're mad!
- I was angry!

04:51.960 --> 04:53.910
Don't you think I had every right to be?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.470
She destroyed my marriage!

04:55.520 --> 04:57.550
No, Jamie did. He cheated on you.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.630
- If it wasn't with Tina, it would
have been someone else. - Oh,
really? Because you cheated too.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.550
You did everything you could to make me.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.600
It wasn't that hard, Adam.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.800
We both felt it.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.200
I know I did.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.960
That's why I didn't want to hurt you.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.280
What a mess.

05:31.920 --> 05:36.030
Hello, girls. Just doing a quick stock
take, see who's still breathing.

Ooh, eh, I'll invite my Nikki!

05:54.200 --> 05:56.320
- Where are we going?
- Hollingworth Lake.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.830
And there goes the mystery.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.270
I did my courting there.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.320
- With Derek?
- Among others.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.150
We'd cycle round the lake, then
have fish and chips at the cafe.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.070
I did the same thing with my Frank.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.910
Well, there was bugger all
else to do in Rochdale.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.750
Oh, I miss them cycle rides.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.270
I miss going three hours
without needing to pee.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.230
Well, let's hope there's no
hold-ups on the M62, shall we?

06:21.940 --> 06:23.110
Pig of a day.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.750
Well, it's about to get better.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.750
Your husband's left you.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.030
What?!

06:28.080 --> 06:29.550
You heard what she said.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.270
The whole restaurant heard.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.790
"You're a waste of space and
you take up too much of it."

06:33.840 --> 06:35.150
She didn't say that, Pete.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
Up in our room she did.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.830
Oh.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.750
If it's space she wants,
then she can have it.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.510
Oh, for God's sakes!

06:44.560 --> 06:48.390
- I'm working full time! He's meant to be
running things here. - Instead he's run off.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.910
And who can blame him?

06:49.960 --> 06:52.830
- What's for tea?
- Eh? Oh.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.800
I don't suppose he put that on
before he legged it, did he?

06:57.240 --> 06:59.240
Beans on toast, love.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.270

07:37.000 --> 07:40.630
I've established the third party was
not the cause of your marital breakdown.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.960
So you're saying she's not seeing anyone?

07:44.680 --> 07:49.880
Look, much as I like to see a
grown man squirm, I don't have
the time, so let's cut to the chase.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.200
Jules is getting better.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.400
He's learnt how to work the auto-focus.

I should warn you, George, that I
am a black belt in Jeet Kune Do.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.600
And I should warn you, David,
that I don't give a flying fuck.

08:06.760 --> 08:10.030

you were banging my wife.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.080
Are you?

08:12.560 --> 08:15.280
- It was never my intention.
- Answer the question!

08:17.640 --> 08:19.360
We have been intimate, yes.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.799

Ah, flowers.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.590
Seriously?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.310
I think it's going to
take a lot more than that.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
- They're for you.
- Why?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.560
For letting me in.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.920
Hi.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.800
I'm angry. I'm hurt.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.590
I also know I'm partly to blame.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.750
If I hadn't had an affair with Jamie,
she wouldn't have come after you.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.880
Even so, I didn't need to respond.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
Please come home.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.790
Let's start again.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.360
We were trying for a
family. I can try harder.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.630
Just have a baby to fix things?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.230
No!

10:05.280 --> 10:07.280
We wanted one before all this.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.480
All I want is for us to be a family.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.760
Me, you, Matt...

10:15.240 --> 10:17.630
I want to ask you something.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.680
I need you to be honest.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.400
Do you have feelings for her?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.760
You don't need to answer. You just did.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.880
You can see yourself out.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.010
- Hiya.
- A-ha.

10:54.060 --> 10:57.930
- I thought you might let me down.
- Well, it's Sunday. I'm not working.

10:57.980 --> 10:59.530
United aren't playing.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.450
He's roped you in as well, has he?

11:01.500 --> 11:04.170
How many of us do you need to
take old blokes to the toilet?

11:04.220 --> 11:05.450
I am not toilet monitor.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.650
No, David is skilled labour.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.170
He's driving the coach.

11:09.220 --> 11:11.170
Joe needs the loo before we set off.

11:11.220 --> 11:14.450
All right. Come on, Joe. I'll
take you. You lead the way.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.770
- I should have gone to church.
- Amen.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.130
24 all in.

11:19.180 --> 11:21.170
- Nikki!
- Come with me. Come on.

11:21.220 --> 11:22.610
I didn't expect to see you here.

11:22.660 --> 11:24.570
So the look on your face would suggest.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.250
You know my mum's one of the inmates.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.780
Oh, right. Yeah, I'm
her driver for the day.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.610
Have you been avoiding me? You've
not returned any of my calls.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.370
It was my phone. I've been
searching for it everywhere.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.940
Did... Did you check your top pocket?

11:49.860 --> 11:51.860
Sorry, I've been very busy.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.260
Nikki, I...

11:56.620 --> 11:59.220
You don't think you've
been followed, do you?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.660
No, David, I don't.

12:05.140 --> 12:07.890
I don't know why you needed me to come.

12:07.940 --> 12:09.810
It's a day out for families.

12:09.860 --> 12:13.090
- It's not like you're even a resident.
- Pete invited me.

12:13.140 --> 12:15.290
He's family. And so are you.

12:15.340 --> 12:17.340
Anyway, he's going to be busy.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.330
Peter, love.

12:20.380 --> 12:22.370
Barbara.

12:22.420 --> 12:24.530
Wife.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.090
Your children say hello.

12:26.140 --> 12:28.140
I know. I do speak to them.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.690
I wish you and Pete
would talk to each other.

12:33.740 --> 12:37.330
He's the one who flounced off. I
don't know what to say to him.

12:37.380 --> 12:39.370
We haven't got anything
in common any more.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.810
You've got decades of shared history!

12:41.860 --> 12:43.170
You've got your kids.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.290
- You've got me.
- Talking about you

12:46.340 --> 12:49.650
is not going to get us through the
next 10 years of marriage, is it?

12:49.700 --> 12:51.450
Although there is plenty of material.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.500
How is Tina? Is she talking to you?

12:54.780 --> 12:56.810
She came round to see me last night.

12:56.860 --> 12:59.090
Jenny doesn't love me any more.

12:59.140 --> 13:01.140
Tina hates me.

13:02.220 --> 13:06.900
Nikki's husband has threatened
to maim my daughters.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.970
- Hiya.
- Hi.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.370
I've just come to get some more stuff.

13:19.420 --> 13:21.420
I'm quitting my job.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.130
Because you've got feelings for Sarah?

13:28.180 --> 13:30.050
No.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.170
Because I love you.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.220
I want to save our relationship.

13:37.660 --> 13:40.060
Then is there anything
else I need to know?

13:40.660 --> 13:41.930
About what?

13:41.980 --> 13:43.980
I don't know, Adam.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.860
That's why I'm asking.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.340
No.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
OK.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.280
We'll see what Sarah has to say.

14:01.060 --> 14:02.770
I'm going to meet her for a coffee.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.610
You're what?

14:04.660 --> 14:08.780
Until she and I have had it out, I
don't think you and I can move forward.

14:10.420 --> 14:11.690
'Oh, God, Adam.'

14:11.740 --> 14:13.730
Did you lie about what happened?

14:13.780 --> 14:15.780
No, no, no. I told her the truth.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.420
I just didn't tell her all the truth.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.890
There was a kiss in the
stationery cupboard.

14:21.940 --> 14:23.330
It sounds like something out of Cluedo.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.730
"Adam Williams, in the stationery
cupboard, with a stiffie."

14:26.780 --> 14:28.010
Sorry. Go on.

14:28.060 --> 14:32.650
We only kissed but afterwards
I went round to Sarah's house.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.250
- Oh, shit!
- No, I didn't go in.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.250
My bloody conscience got the better of me.

14:36.300 --> 14:40.170
But, you know, if she tells Tina I
even thought about having an affair

14:40.220 --> 14:41.770
or how close we've become...

14:41.820 --> 14:43.810
No. OK, just phone her. Now.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.890
- Tina?
- No, Sarah!

14:45.940 --> 14:47.940
Beg her not to say anything.

14:57.820 --> 14:59.820
Thank you for coming.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.380
Where would you like to start?

15:02.780 --> 15:04.890
By apologising for fucking my husband?

15:04.940 --> 15:06.940
I'll come back in a minute.

15:10.060 --> 15:11.290
I don't know, Jen.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.170
It might do more harm than good.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.170
Let's just hope she meant it when she said

15:15.220 --> 15:17.700
she doesn't want to
cause me any more grief.

15:18.180 --> 15:20.490
Know the biggest difference
between Adam and Jamie?

15:20.540 --> 15:22.850
Look, I know we've each
slept with both of them

15:22.900 --> 15:25.780
but I'm not about to go
comparing notes, all right?

15:27.940 --> 15:29.940
Adam regrets cheating.

15:31.820 --> 15:33.820
Jamie regrets getting caught.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.970
Adam loves you.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.020
He wants to stay with you.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.100
I'm not sure I want to stay with him.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.660
That should give me pleasure.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.050
We're both losers in this.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.090
No. I am.

15:52.140 --> 15:53.530
Twice.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.860
Whether you are, that's still up to you.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.210
Can't we go home?

15:59.260 --> 16:02.140
Ellie, you were fine when
we were shopping for you.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.820
Oh, look, there's Gareth!

16:06.020 --> 16:07.490
Whose are those kids?

16:07.540 --> 16:09.290
Well, his I'd imagine.

16:09.340 --> 16:11.570
No, no, he doesn't have any.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.450
Well, that looks like their gran.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.970
Maybe he's their uncle.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.940
- Go and ask him.
- No. No. Come on, let's just go.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.540
Cool!

16:32.940 --> 16:34.940
Oh, Peter, you love!

16:35.460 --> 16:37.460
Ooh, this is just like the old days!

16:38.180 --> 16:40.010
I bet your Frank didn't wear a helmet.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.570
No, and nine months
later our Nikki was born.

16:44.260 --> 16:46.330
♪ One, two, three, take
my hand and come with me

16:46.380 --> 16:49.660
♪ Because you look so fine that
I really wanna make you mine

16:55.540 --> 16:58.100
♪ I said, are you gonna be my girl?

16:58.340 --> 17:00.330
They think the world of Pete, you know.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.010
Is that why you brought me here?

17:02.060 --> 17:04.290
To show me the high esteem he's held in?

17:04.339 --> 17:06.339
No.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.300
He is though, isn't he?

17:11.460 --> 17:13.460
I don't know what it is you want.

17:15.780 --> 17:17.490
Neither do I, Mum.

17:17.540 --> 17:20.420
I just know I don't want what I've got.

17:21.859 --> 17:23.210
I know I want more.

17:23.260 --> 17:24.890
"More"?

17:24.940 --> 17:26.890
It's what everybody wants now, isn't it?

17:26.940 --> 17:28.940
No-one's ever satisfied.

17:29.180 --> 17:33.770
Then you get to our age and you
realise just how fortunate you were

17:33.820 --> 17:37.500
and you wish you'd appreciated what
you had while you still had it.

17:47.020 --> 17:49.300
I can already feel my calves seizing up.

17:50.380 --> 17:53.730
I'd offer to rub some Deep Heat into
them but I think you'd run a mile.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.580
Or hobble.

17:58.140 --> 18:00.220
I'm sorry. I should have called you.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.690
I'm a grown-up, David.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.370
And then some. I can take rejection.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.850
No, I like you enormously, Nikki.
You're warm, you're witty...

18:07.900 --> 18:10.220
Wealthy, once my divorce comes through.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.820
Well, that's the least of it.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.740
Please understand, it's about me, not you.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
I just can't continue seeing you.

18:26.940 --> 18:27.980
- Cos...
- David!

18:30.260 --> 18:32.580
David... it's time we were heading back.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.140
Honestly, it's for the best.

18:47.020 --> 18:49.020
Oh, thank you, David.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.690
Oh, listen, just come home, Pete.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.490
There's no point you not being there.

19:11.540 --> 19:14.570
Being there? You said
you'd rather I wasn't.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.330
That was just the heat of the moment.

19:16.380 --> 19:20.370
You also said that you've been
feeling like this for months.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.090
I mean, what would change?

19:22.140 --> 19:24.140
Nothing. Nothing.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.130
You'd only get more miserable.

19:27.180 --> 19:29.010
Make life miserable for me and the kids.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.610
Well, what is the alternative?

19:30.660 --> 19:33.860
That we accept that 12 years is our limit.

19:36.580 --> 19:40.340
We called it quits then and I
think we should do it again now.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.890
Wait, so, sorry, are you
saying that you want a divorce?

19:45.940 --> 19:48.090
That's what YOU said you wanted.

19:48.140 --> 19:51.010
And I always, always
give you what you want.

19:51.060 --> 19:52.270
So, yes, Jen...

19:53.820 --> 19:55.690
.. I want a divorce.

19:55.740 --> 19:58.420
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I am rather busy.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.770
I didn't go enough.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.210
That was exactly why.

20:17.260 --> 20:19.260
Hi.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.450
I, er, I've got to go and do something.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.010
Homework?

20:24.060 --> 20:26.060
Could be.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.220
I saw Sarah.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.700
She told me everything.

20:41.860 --> 20:43.860
OK, can I just say one...

20:46.620 --> 20:48.620
Can we not say anything else?

21:05.980 --> 21:08.290
♪ You leapt from crumbling bridges

21:08.340 --> 21:12.820
♪ Watching cityscapes turn to dust...

21:15.780 --> 21:17.780
Shall we order starters?

21:18.460 --> 21:20.660
I'm not sure I'll be staying that long.

21:24.220 --> 21:27.020
Who were the children I saw
you with on the street?

21:28.100 --> 21:30.580
Oh. My son and daughter.

21:31.260 --> 21:34.290
- Ready to order? - Sorry. We're going
to need a minute. Thanks very much.

21:34.340 --> 21:36.340
Certainly.

21:37.060 --> 21:39.330
We stayed up all night
sharing our life stories.

21:39.380 --> 21:42.330
At least, I did. And you
overlooked two children.

21:42.380 --> 21:44.050
Wait. Hear me out. Look...

21:44.100 --> 21:46.380
I didn't want to scare you off.

21:47.580 --> 21:49.050
Their mum walked out on us.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.700
I am a full-time father
of two young children.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.290
Most of my dates, when I mention that,

21:54.340 --> 21:57.240
feel a sudden need to use the
loo, and I never see them again.

21:58.580 --> 21:59.890
I don't blame them.

21:59.940 --> 22:02.730
They think you're holding
auditions for a new mum.

22:02.780 --> 22:07.130
And I'm not. I'm just looking for
attractive, intelligent company.

22:07.180 --> 22:09.260
That's why I was attracted to you.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.140
And because you think I'm vain
enough to fall for flattery?

22:15.820 --> 22:17.580
You lied. You lied to me.

22:18.300 --> 22:19.770
Oh, come on...

22:19.820 --> 22:22.340
I don't think you've
been fully open with me.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.460
Would you like to order
from the wine list?

22:26.620 --> 22:28.620
Not for me, thanks.

22:29.300 --> 22:30.620
No.

22:31.820 --> 22:35.740
But um... I am ready to order a starter.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.030
And a main.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.380
Don't read too much into it.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.780

23:22.580 --> 23:25.580
Oh, here, did you manage to
have that chat with Jenny?

23:30.020 --> 23:31.570
Do you get the...

23:31.620 --> 23:34.780
distinct impression that Pathos
isn't a morning type of guy?

23:44.620 --> 23:47.020
Yeah, well, no. Great chatting with you.

23:54.380 --> 23:57.450
Karen, you mustn't let what
I'm about to say alarm you.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.330
That is about the most alarming
way you can start a conversation.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.250
- You know Nikki?
- Your new girlfriend.

24:02.300 --> 24:04.250
- My ex.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

24:04.300 --> 24:07.690
Well, her husband, who she was
leaving, is jealous and vindictive.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.210
So why have you split up?

24:09.260 --> 24:12.370
Because her husband is jealous and
vindictive. He's warned me off.

24:12.420 --> 24:15.250
Not like you to allow yourself
to be bullied and you shouldn't.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.900
Karen, he's threatened
to harm our children.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.810
- What?!
- It's probably nothing.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.090
- You've got to stop seeing her.
- I have.

24:23.140 --> 24:25.890
But we were seen together again.
An unfortunate coincidence.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.970
- Is this man serious?
- Deadly.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.490
No, not deadly! But he
is capable of violence.

24:30.540 --> 24:33.970
- David, you need to go to the police.
- And say what? He'll just deny it.

24:34.020 --> 24:35.730
Look, I won't see her again

24:35.780 --> 24:38.570
- and he probably won't react.
- Stop saying "probably"!

24:38.620 --> 24:42.090
I just felt I ought to tell you. But
there's probably nothing to worry about.

24:42.140 --> 24:45.130
You need to talk to him, get it
sorted. Do something, for God's sake!

24:45.180 --> 24:47.770
- I will. I am. Ellie!
- Hey, Dad.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.410
- Can I go into town tonight?
- No!

24:50.900 --> 24:52.410
You get this sorted, David.

24:52.460 --> 24:54.460
Or I will!

24:57.140 --> 24:59.140
My resignation.

24:59.980 --> 25:01.090
Snap.

25:01.140 --> 25:02.450
You're quitting?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.850
- It's your company.
- It's Sarah's resignation.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.210
I don't know what's been
going on between you two.

25:07.260 --> 25:10.180
I can imagine, though given
your age, I'd rather not.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.970
I don't want to lose you both.

25:13.020 --> 25:15.020
And she insisted I accept hers.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.380
You might catch her before she leaves.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.500
Sarah.

25:23.900 --> 25:24.980
Sarah.

25:25.740 --> 25:27.940
I was hoping to be gone before I saw you.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.900
You lied for me.

25:31.100 --> 25:33.100
To Tina.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
Because I told you the truth.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.420
I do care for you, Adam.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.730
At least that's one good
thing to come out of this.

25:43.780 --> 25:46.780
I've found I've a greater
capacity for love than hate.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.370
Here.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.820
Something to remember me by.
You were always stealing mine.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.380
I'm sorry, Sarah.

26:02.780 --> 26:04.780
What for?

26:06.580 --> 26:08.210
I don't know.

26:08.260 --> 26:10.260
Yeah.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.900
Maybe if things were different, eh?

26:14.340 --> 26:17.180
Another time, another place.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.700
Goodbye, Adam.

26:38.060 --> 26:40.780
You might want to wipe my
lipstick off your cheek.

26:51.940 --> 26:53.210
Robbie!

26:53.260 --> 26:55.460
- Great to see you again.
- And you, David.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.300
I was surprised to get your call.

27:00.500 --> 27:02.530
When I left prison, I
said I'd keep in touch.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.450
- Yeah, but you haven't.
- I know, but...

27:05.500 --> 27:08.730
- I've been thinking about your
little problem. - With George.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.330
Will you come with me to see him?

27:10.380 --> 27:12.290
Act as your muscle?

27:12.340 --> 27:14.340
If I thought it would do any good.

27:15.220 --> 27:17.420
But suppose we beat the shit out of him.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.730
Think that would be the end of it?

27:20.780 --> 27:22.090
No. Probably just the start.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.210
You need to show him who's boss.

27:24.260 --> 27:26.570
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

27:26.620 --> 27:30.260
Sends one of yours to the hospital,
send one of his to the morgue.

27:31.580 --> 27:33.850
You really think it could come to that?

27:33.900 --> 27:36.330
I'm quoting The Untouchables.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.890
Kevin Costner, Sean Connery?

27:37.940 --> 27:39.970
I haven't seen it.

27:40.020 --> 27:42.020
It's probably just as well.

27:42.580 --> 27:44.580
So here's my question.

27:45.140 --> 27:48.620
How far are you prepared to
go to protect your family?

27:49.180 --> 27:51.180
I'll do anything.

27:52.660 --> 27:54.660
It's my family.

28:10.060 --> 28:12.060
Oh, my God!

28:12.180 --> 28:16.850
- Is it loaded? - Without bullets,
David, a gun is just a paperweight.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.370
You don't have to use it.

28:18.420 --> 28:21.620
You just need to impress upon
him that you're prepared to.

28:26.780 --> 28:28.780
I'm not a violent man, Robbie.

28:29.380 --> 28:30.650
David.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.700
It's your family.

28:39.860 --> 28:42.970
"Sperm concentration,
fair; motility, good."

28:43.020 --> 28:47.730
- It's a bit like the shipping forecast, isn't
it? - Well, they both have an impact on seamen!

28:47.780 --> 28:50.810
Presumably you spoke to your GP and
she's explained what all this means.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.250
Yeah. She says that with a
fair wind, a following sea,

28:53.300 --> 28:55.980
there's a reasonable
chance I'll knock you up.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.020
- Reasonable?
- "Fair to moderate, decreasing later."

28:59.460 --> 29:01.770
Yeah. It's good news.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.060
It is, yeah.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.650
It is good news. So why
aren't you punching the air?

29:09.700 --> 29:12.930
I am. I am inside.

29:12.980 --> 29:16.210
It's just... I don't know, Pete...

29:16.260 --> 29:18.930
Maybe it's because I scraped through.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.690
I'm used to being good at things.

29:20.740 --> 29:23.450
Only you could be competitive
about a sperm test!

29:23.500 --> 29:25.500
Or maybe it's...

29:25.780 --> 29:27.730
Look, you know when you're in a restaurant

29:27.780 --> 29:30.370
- and torn between two dishes...
- Halloumi and whitebait.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.370
- What? - When we go Greek, I
can never decide on a starter.

29:33.420 --> 29:34.970
- Cos I love them both.
- No, exactly!

29:35.020 --> 29:37.210
And it doesn't matter
what dish you choose...

29:37.260 --> 29:39.490
- Halloumi.
- Halloumi.

29:39.540 --> 29:44.140
.. there's always a part of you that thinks you
would have been better off with the whitebait.

29:44.580 --> 29:47.610
- You can always have whitebait next time.
- There isn't a next time.

29:47.660 --> 29:49.660
Well, you hope there won't be.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.460
We do love Greek food.

29:53.740 --> 29:55.250
No, it's an analogy.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.180
About Tina and Sarah.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.170
Oh.

29:59.220 --> 30:02.570
Gareth may say he's not looking for a mum
for his kids and I'm sure he means that

30:02.620 --> 30:04.370
but honestly, at their age,

30:04.420 --> 30:07.290
that's bound to be how they see a
new woman in his life, isn't it?

30:07.340 --> 30:10.370
And do I really want to go back to
that stage of bringing up a family?

30:10.420 --> 30:12.610
I'm looking forward to
being out the other side.

30:12.660 --> 30:14.530
It's so much easier when you're younger.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.610
You just meet somebody that you
like, your hormones kick in.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.730
Bit of dry rubbing. Bingo.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.500
Middle age, Jen, it's messy.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.770
I can't help it. I...
I feel sorry for Sarah.

30:27.820 --> 30:30.020
No, it's Tina I feel sorry for.

30:30.380 --> 30:33.490
You need to forget Sarah and
take whitebait off the menu.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.850
No, forget the analogy.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.900
- Or go on a diet.
- Forget it!

30:39.620 --> 30:41.730
Have you made any progress with Jen?

30:41.780 --> 30:45.450
'I'm not sure you'd call
it progress as such.'

30:45.500 --> 30:47.500
He's announced he wants a divorce.

30:48.060 --> 30:50.050
- What?
- It's your fault.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.660
- Mine?
- Yeah, it was your idea.

30:52.220 --> 30:55.370
I don't know what it is. I don't
know what'll make her happy any more.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.170
Stop being a doormat for starters!
You let her walk all over you.

30:58.220 --> 31:00.050
- I've left home.
- That's just a hissy fit.

31:00.100 --> 31:02.930
Stand up for yourself instead of
trying to please her all the time.

31:02.980 --> 31:05.010
Then she might have some respect for you.

31:05.060 --> 31:08.340
I said grow a pair, not demand a divorce!

31:09.700 --> 31:11.700
You eejit!

31:15.980 --> 31:18.860
Do you really think you'd
be happier without him?

31:19.660 --> 31:20.890
I think I could be, yeah.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.650
Because you nearly were, you know.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.060
What?

31:28.500 --> 31:29.540
OK...

31:31.220 --> 31:33.220
Last year...

31:33.620 --> 31:34.780
He got so low...

31:36.820 --> 31:38.820
that he considered suicide...

31:41.180 --> 31:43.330
What are you talking about?

31:43.380 --> 31:47.580
He took himself off to a quarry, stood
on the edge, thought about jumping.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.100
- I don't believe you.
- He told me so himself.

31:54.220 --> 31:56.250
He didn't... He didn't say anything to me.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.300
Cos he didn't want you to know.

31:58.900 --> 32:02.290
It was only you and the kids that
stopped him from stepping off.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.420
- Oh, shit.
- Take it. Talk to him.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.500
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, for...

32:11.660 --> 32:14.850
- Pete. - Is Jen there?
Adam's in hospital.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.570
Yeah, he's been beaten up.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.620
Tell Jen to meet me at A&E.

32:24.820 --> 32:27.020
You know, you scared the shit out of us.

32:27.620 --> 32:29.620
What actually happened?

32:32.900 --> 32:36.100
- We were out for a drink.
- Whoa, you're underage.

32:36.860 --> 32:38.490
There were some lads hassling me.

32:38.540 --> 32:42.130
Yeah, I could see that she didn't
like it. So told them to do one.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.570
Yeah. Three of them.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.210
All bigger than him.

32:45.260 --> 32:46.970
Adam came to back me up.

32:47.020 --> 32:49.410
- And I was the one who got hit.
- I owe you, mate.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.370
Sounds like you two.

32:51.420 --> 32:54.050
Well, we did used to get
into a bit of bother.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.050
You were the one that always got smacked.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.370
The next generation.

32:57.420 --> 32:59.420
Younger, not wiser.

33:05.220 --> 33:07.210
You understood you weren't
to see Nikki again!

33:07.260 --> 33:09.010
It was a coincidence, that's all.

33:09.060 --> 33:11.060
- And I'm not seeing her.
- Bullshit!

33:11.420 --> 33:13.650
The two of you are laughing
at me behind my back.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.700
No-one does that!

33:16.540 --> 33:19.130
Lift your threat to harm my family.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.980
Or what?

33:21.620 --> 33:23.610
Or you'll see just how far I'll go.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.660
Oh, what're you gonna do, eh?

33:26.300 --> 33:30.180
Report me to the police,
write a letter to the papers?

33:31.220 --> 33:34.450
- You've got no idea who you're dealing with.
- Oh, but I have, George.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.570
You're a wife beater and a bully.

33:36.620 --> 33:38.490
I've known your type all my life.

33:38.540 --> 33:41.940
Intimidating people to
mask your inadequacy.

33:43.100 --> 33:45.100
You pompous twat!

33:48.500 --> 33:50.500
I've warned you, George!

33:51.260 --> 33:52.160
I've warned...

33:57.020 --> 33:58.540
I just shat myself!

34:01.020 --> 34:03.210
Silly little sod.

34:03.260 --> 34:04.540
Yeah.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.780
Still, puts things in
perspective, though, doesn't it?

34:09.659 --> 34:13.170
Realising how close you can
come to losing somebody you love.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.929
Let's not be melodramatic, Jen.

34:14.980 --> 34:17.010
I'm talking about you.

34:17.060 --> 34:19.060
Last year.

34:19.659 --> 34:21.929
- Adam's told you.
- You should have.

34:21.980 --> 34:23.330
I'll kill him.

34:23.380 --> 34:26.179
Why? For trying to save our marriage?

34:27.699 --> 34:29.690
I don't want to get a divorce.

34:29.739 --> 34:32.210
I don't want you to
stay with me out of pity.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.889
I wouldn't.

34:33.940 --> 34:37.139
You know, it makes you think.

34:38.219 --> 34:41.179
I don't think I thought it all through.

34:42.699 --> 34:44.540
Let's start again, yeah?

34:47.100 --> 34:48.730
Press reset.

34:48.780 --> 34:50.770
But do it differently.

34:50.820 --> 34:52.889
So we can get through the next 12 years.

34:52.940 --> 34:54.940
But how do we do that?

34:55.260 --> 34:57.260
Draw up a new marriage contract.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.780
We'll have to negotiate terms, mind.

35:02.220 --> 35:05.140
I know I haven't been blameless.

35:06.260 --> 35:08.010
Oh, Pete...

35:08.060 --> 35:09.300
Look, here's what I'll do.

35:10.340 --> 35:13.850
I'll support you more in your
ambitions. I won't pay you lip service.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.530
I'll be on board properly.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.890
Actually, that is my first demand.

35:17.940 --> 35:19.770
Well, great. Let's do this.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.410
Let's get a pen and paper.

35:21.460 --> 35:23.700
I think there's some under the magazine.

35:24.020 --> 35:25.940
Can I have some water?

35:28.380 --> 35:30.130
Yeah, yeah.

35:30.180 --> 35:31.300
Here, here. I'll get it.

35:55.460 --> 35:57.460
- David.
- Sit.

36:03.300 --> 36:06.890
So, I went home to pick up some stuff

36:06.940 --> 36:10.250
and George filled me
in on your little spat.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.220
And what caused it.

36:13.740 --> 36:16.660
Is that the reason you didn't
want to see me any more?

36:17.060 --> 36:19.060
It's the only reason.

36:20.060 --> 36:22.140
It's no longer the 19th century, boys.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.940
You no longer get to decide my fate.

36:25.820 --> 36:29.500
So, George, we are getting divorced.

36:29.980 --> 36:34.970
David will handle our financial settlement,
representing both our interests.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.650
And I will continue seeing him.

36:37.700 --> 36:41.300
And if you have issue with any of that...

36:41.980 --> 36:45.890
then I will let our children know

36:45.940 --> 36:47.970
exactly what kind of a man

36:48.020 --> 36:49.620
their father can be.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.570
Did you put her up to this?

36:54.620 --> 36:56.730
No.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.780
No, you haven't got the balls.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.300
But she has.

37:02.060 --> 37:04.060
Good luck.

37:13.340 --> 37:15.340
Meet a friend of Daddy's first.

37:15.620 --> 37:18.250
- Karen, this is Millie.
- Hello.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.170
- And this is Arthur.
- Hi.

37:20.220 --> 37:21.530
- He's my brother.
- Is he?

37:21.580 --> 37:23.370
Well, this is Olivia. She's my daughter.

37:23.420 --> 37:26.140
- Hi. - Shall we go and play
football? - Yeah, come on!

37:27.180 --> 37:29.180
Sweet.

37:29.660 --> 37:31.770
You're under no obligation
to meet them again.

37:31.820 --> 37:36.380
I'd just like them to know who I mean
when I talk of Daddy's girlfriend.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.580
♪ Why would I ever surface again?

37:48.740 --> 37:52.850
♪ To be outshone and eclipsed
by your invisible friend

37:52.900 --> 37:55.380
Sorry, everyone! Parking was a nightmare.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.210
Right, shall we get started?

37:58.260 --> 38:00.010
Have you cut yourself shaving?

38:00.060 --> 38:02.850
No, I was just dealing
with my little problem.

38:02.900 --> 38:05.210
It's all sorted. As they say.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.770
So, welcome, everyone.

38:07.820 --> 38:11.330
This is the very spot

38:11.380 --> 38:12.930
in this great city

38:12.980 --> 38:15.970
where, Pete tells me, he
asked Jenny to marry him

38:16.020 --> 38:18.450
- for the second time.
- That's true.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.770
So it seems fitting
we're gathered here today

38:20.820 --> 38:23.010
for this renewal of their vows.

38:23.060 --> 38:25.130
Now, when they asked me to officiate...

38:25.180 --> 38:27.770
You promised you wouldn't go
on. Is there much of this?

38:27.820 --> 38:30.010
I've just got a couple
of pages. And a hymn.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.290
- Hymns?!
- Will Your Anchor Hold.

38:32.340 --> 38:35.820
- It's the Boys' Brigade anthem.
It's a classic. - I'm on a meter.

38:36.220 --> 38:39.250
OK, all right. Right,
let's cut to the chase.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.570
Pete, come on. Come up here.

38:40.620 --> 38:44.730
Pete and I just wanted to say
a few words to each other.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.010
Um, do you want to go first?

38:46.060 --> 38:47.770
No, no, you go first.

38:47.820 --> 38:49.060
OK!

38:50.740 --> 38:52.370
Pete...

38:52.420 --> 38:56.540
at times you really piss me off.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.590
Seriously.

38:59.140 --> 39:02.610
You know, the way you
sing one line of a song

39:02.660 --> 39:05.370
over and over again,

39:05.420 --> 39:08.450
chew your toenail clippings...
I mean, who does that?

39:08.500 --> 39:09.970
.. think you're funnier than me.

39:10.020 --> 39:13.610
The crap impressions you
do of me when I'm cross...

39:14.360 --> 39:15.560
The...

39:18.740 --> 39:20.970
OK. But...

39:21.020 --> 39:23.140
we have come this far together.

39:24.340 --> 39:27.020
It would seem a hell of a
waste to chuck it away now.

39:27.980 --> 39:29.250
It's not going to be easy.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.730
We're going to both have to change
to accommodate each other, but...

39:32.780 --> 39:36.260
I'm so willing to try.

39:37.620 --> 39:40.210
Cos I don't want to lose you.

39:40.260 --> 39:43.170
Ever. We're family.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.650
Wait, wait. Come here. Come here.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.700
Come here.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.620
We're family.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.860
We've got each other's backs.

39:53.620 --> 39:56.660
You are my everything,

39:57.500 --> 39:59.780
for better or worse.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.380
Pete.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.810
I love you, Jen.

40:25.620 --> 40:26.770
OK. Hang on! Hang on!

40:26.820 --> 40:29.090
Hang on. There's, there's...

40:29.140 --> 40:31.060
There's one thing I need to say. Um...

40:32.420 --> 40:34.730
Pete and Jen...

40:34.780 --> 40:36.250
I love you two.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.730
Both individually and together.

40:38.780 --> 40:40.090
But more together.

40:40.140 --> 40:43.100
Because you're greater
than the sum of your parts.

40:44.980 --> 40:46.730
We all are.

40:46.780 --> 40:49.980
Whether we're family or friends...

40:52.420 --> 40:54.420
We're a community.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.130
Indivisible.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.090
Blimey. That's deep for him.

40:58.140 --> 40:59.690
I think he got it off the internet.

40:59.740 --> 41:03.170
You and Pete, you're like a
barnacle on a ship's hull...

41:03.220 --> 41:05.450
- That bit's him.
- You're fused together.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.290
You never split up.

41:07.340 --> 41:10.290
- Well, except we already did.
- Yeah, but it didn't last.

41:10.340 --> 41:13.210
It couldn't. That's what
we're all searching for.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.780
The certainty...

41:17.340 --> 41:21.220
.. that our destinies are bound together.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.580
Oh, come here, you big softie!

41:31.780 --> 41:33.780
The three amigos.

41:36.780 --> 41:39.850
Yes, hello. Hello. This
is about me and him!

41:39.900 --> 41:41.370
OK.

41:41.420 --> 41:43.420
Me and you.

41:44.380 --> 41:46.380
Mmm.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.580
That was lovely, what you said.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.500
- Thank you.
- Heartfelt.

42:04.780 --> 42:07.660
But you couldn't say that
about us, though, could you?

42:09.260 --> 42:11.340
That we're destined to be together.

42:14.180 --> 42:15.410
We don't know yet.

42:15.460 --> 42:17.140
Don't we?

42:18.940 --> 42:21.220
I think we both really want it to be true.

42:23.620 --> 42:26.100
It doesn't mean that
it is, though, does it?

42:27.540 --> 42:29.540
Or ever will be.

42:32.580 --> 42:35.260
You asked me if I still
have feelings for Sarah.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.930
The truth is... I don't know.

42:37.980 --> 42:39.980
But...

42:41.340 --> 42:43.340
.. that scares the shit out of me.

42:46.580 --> 42:49.260
I should never have asked
you to move in with me.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.210
If it ain't broke...

42:53.260 --> 42:55.260
Don't fuck it up.

43:02.940 --> 43:04.940
One thing that's changed, though.

43:07.220 --> 43:09.220
I know that I want a baby.

43:10.740 --> 43:12.740
But I don't think we should.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.660
I don't want to split up.

43:21.220 --> 43:23.220
Me neither.

43:23.620 --> 43:25.620
But I think we should.

43:26.460 --> 43:28.460
Yeah.

43:30.820 --> 43:32.820
Eh, who knows?

43:33.580 --> 43:36.060
We might find that we
can't bear to be apart.

43:39.820 --> 43:41.490
We're gonna...

43:41.540 --> 43:42.740
Oh.

43:48.540 --> 43:50.210
We're going to make a move.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.620
Yeah.

43:52.220 --> 43:54.220
I think I'll come with you.

43:56.780 --> 43:58.780
I'm just gonna stay here for a while.

44:00.100 --> 44:02.090
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.250
OK.

44:03.300 --> 44:05.300
If that's what you want.

44:05.740 --> 44:07.740
I guess we'll find out.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.860
Come on.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.100
