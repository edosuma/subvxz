Breaking Bad...

00:03.164 --> 00:04.206
That's where you do it.

00:04.326 --> 00:06.291
- What, exactly?
- Get your methylamine.

00:06.396 --> 00:08.295
Rob it?
Like Jesse James?

00:08.453 --> 00:10.043
The children cannot be here.

00:10.140 --> 00:14.539
You agree to that and I will be whatever
kind of partner you want me to be.

00:14.652 --> 00:15.788
Legacy cost.

00:16.403 --> 00:18.259
It should come out of your end.

00:18.398 --> 00:21.163
No one can ever know
that this robbery went down.

00:21.267 --> 00:22.377
Absolutely.

00:26.125 --> 00:26.873
No!

00:27.520 --> 00:28.478
No.

You guys didn't tell me this
stuff smells like cat piss.

04:12.278 --> 04:14.913
Man.
Shit happens, huh?

04:38.953 --> 04:40.154
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

04:40.188 --> 04:44.725
Obviously, I guess
you see it different.

04:44.759 --> 04:46.760
Some of you. But I didn't see
any other choice.

04:46.794 --> 04:48.262
I've been thinking
about this all day,

04:48.296 --> 04:50.130
going over and over
it in my head,

04:50.148 --> 04:51.815
and it was the only way.

04:53.801 --> 04:56.236
Well, it's not like
I wanted to.

04:56.271 --> 04:58.638
The kid was on a dirt bike.
I mean, he could've just--

04:58.656 --> 05:00.107
He could've just gunned it
and been gone

05:00.141 --> 05:01.975
before we even
had a chance to blink.

05:01.993 --> 05:03.193
We never would've been able
to catch him.

05:03.244 --> 05:05.329
I was thinking on my feet.
I saw a threat,

05:05.363 --> 05:07.414
and I took care of it
the only way that I could.

05:07.449 --> 05:08.999
A threat?

05:09.033 --> 05:11.502
The kid was waving at us.

05:11.536 --> 05:13.837
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

05:13.872 --> 05:15.205
Yeah, but you don't know that.

05:15.256 --> 05:16.673
Yeah, I do.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.008
He didn't know what he'd seen.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.259
Well, I didn't want
to take that chance.

05:19.294 --> 05:21.795
I-- The whole point
of this thing was that no one

05:21.829 --> 05:23.881
was supposed know that we
were even there, right?

05:23.932 --> 05:26.717
People weren't ever supposed to
know that anything got robbed.

05:26.768 --> 05:28.886
How could we have let
the kid go?

05:28.937 --> 05:30.637
He made us. If I hadn't
done what I did,

05:30.671 --> 05:32.172
the whole mission
would've failed.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.174
I'm-- I'm real sorry.

05:35.676 --> 05:39.446
I really am, but I--
But did I make a mistake?

05:39.481 --> 05:41.648
Mr. White? 'Cause to me,

05:41.682 --> 05:43.233
you know, respectfully,

05:43.284 --> 05:44.234
I was looking out for the team.

05:44.285 --> 05:45.786
I didn't want to kill him.

05:45.820 --> 05:48.288
You gotta believe that.

05:48.323 --> 05:52.326
At the end of the day, it was
him or us, and I chose us.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.745
And I would do it again.

05:55.830 --> 05:58.382
Okay, look. Uh...

05:58.416 --> 06:03.053
Todd, why don't you step
outside for a few minutes

06:03.087 --> 06:04.805
so we can talk this through?

06:04.839 --> 06:06.807
Of course.
Yeah, you guys talk.

06:06.841 --> 06:08.258
But I just want to make sure

06:08.309 --> 06:10.511
that you know that my priority
is this business.

06:10.545 --> 06:12.879
Okay. That's-- that's fine,
Todd. Thank you.

06:12.897 --> 06:15.232
I want to be
a real part of this.

06:15.266 --> 06:17.317
All right? If you could
just see that. I'm motivated.

06:17.352 --> 06:18.902
And I've got connections.

06:18.937 --> 06:21.488
Yeah. My uncle's got
his hookups in prison

06:21.523 --> 06:23.857
who I think could be
a real help to us if--

06:32.534 --> 06:36.736
Okay. That dude?
Whack-job.

06:36.754 --> 06:38.372
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

06:38.406 --> 06:40.374
Facts? Oh, okay. Uh...

06:40.408 --> 06:42.793
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

06:42.844 --> 06:44.795
A kid that he
didn't need to shoot.

06:44.846 --> 06:46.680
The boy had seen us.

06:46.714 --> 06:51.351
And, no, it didn't look like
he knew what he was seeing.

06:51.386 --> 06:54.805
But what if he told somebody?

06:54.856 --> 06:57.891
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

06:57.925 --> 06:59.943
We can't know what someone--

06:59.978 --> 07:03.763
Exactly. We can't know, because
Ricky Hitler there shot him.

07:03.781 --> 07:07.601
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

07:07.619 --> 07:08.986
We would've figured it out.

07:09.037 --> 07:12.456
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.107
Is that how we do business now?

07:14.125 --> 07:15.442
Look, I understand
you're upset.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.294
And what was that crap
about his uncle

07:17.328 --> 07:19.079
with the-- with the prison
connections?

07:19.113 --> 07:22.115
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move.

07:22.133 --> 07:23.950
- Come on.
- It's true, though.

07:23.968 --> 07:26.503
He does have some connections.

07:26.554 --> 07:27.588
Is this a problem?

07:27.639 --> 07:30.257
No. It's nothing
to be concerned about.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.792
It came up in the background
I did on him.

07:32.810 --> 07:35.629
Didn't worry me then.
He's just flexing.

07:38.483 --> 07:41.151
All right.

07:41.185 --> 07:43.303
It seems to me that we have
three options here,

07:43.321 --> 07:45.522
and none of which are ideal.

07:45.573 --> 07:48.659
One, we fire Todd.

07:48.693 --> 07:52.195
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option,

07:52.247 --> 07:55.482
seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.586
And we'd most likely have
to pay him to keep quiet.

07:59.621 --> 08:03.040
And God only knows we've got
enough of that going on.

08:04.259 --> 08:07.511
Two...

08:07.545 --> 08:09.129
We dispose of him.

08:15.970 --> 08:19.172
Which leaves us option three.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.174
We keep him on payroll.

08:21.192 --> 08:24.895
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

08:24.946 --> 08:28.532
We keep him close.
Under our control.

08:28.566 --> 08:33.654
Now, option three
would be my choice.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.655
Shall we vote?

08:37.857 --> 08:41.193
I vote three, kid.

08:56.094 --> 08:57.427
You're still in.

08:59.380 --> 09:02.316
Right on.
Thank you so much.

09:02.350 --> 09:03.400
You guys totally made
the right--

09:05.153 --> 09:07.404
The next time you bring
a gun to a job

09:07.438 --> 09:09.889
without telling me,

09:09.907 --> 09:13.393
I will stick it
up your ass sideways.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.197
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

10:11.919 --> 10:14.971
Hey, boss. What's up?

10:15.006 --> 10:17.424
I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

10:17.458 --> 10:19.626
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

10:19.644 --> 10:22.229
Well, isn't that sweet?

10:22.263 --> 10:23.980
Here, let me see.

11:04.188 --> 11:06.022
It's a dead drop.

11:06.057 --> 11:07.524
- What?
- A dead drop.

11:07.558 --> 11:10.193
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

11:10.228 --> 11:12.729
Write the time down.
Roll on it.

11:16.651 --> 11:18.485
Looks like he's leaving now.

11:20.705 --> 11:23.957
- Anybody coming for it?
- Nope, not that I can see.

11:23.991 --> 11:27.711
Nobody in sight.
Could be hours.

11:27.745 --> 11:30.046
Could be.

11:30.081 --> 11:32.249
What do you want to do?

12:12.266 --> 12:15.217
<i>It's not my fault that
Murtha's got his panties in a twist.</i>

12:15.251 --> 12:16.718
<i>It's an HR issue, Janice--</i>

12:18.187 --> 12:20.422
<i>I read the report.</i>
<i>I'm calling again</i>

12:20.440 --> 12:23.525

12:27.697 --> 12:30.198

12:30.233 --> 12:32.434
<i>"Looks like it" doesn't equal</i>

12:32.452 --> 12:35.437

12:37.657 --> 12:39.441

12:39.459 --> 12:40.909
<i>How'd he make you guys?</i>
<i>What'd you do?</i>

12:40.943 --> 12:42.961
<i>We honked our horns
and yelled "yoo-hoo."</i>

12:42.996 --> 12:44.279
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>what did we do?</i>

12:44.297 --> 12:45.580
<i>This guy is slippery as hell.</i>

12:45.614 --> 12:47.833
<i>He's been throwing</i>
<i>every tail we put on him.</i>

12:47.884 --> 12:53.138
<i>The guy's a pro.
Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.</i>

12:53.172 --> 12:56.808
<i>One of these days, our pal</i>

12:56.843 --> 12:59.311
<i>Just gotta be there</i>

13:02.965 --> 13:08.320
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.

13:09.939 --> 13:11.473
How's it going?

13:11.491 --> 13:14.493
Oh, you know...
This little munchkin,

13:14.527 --> 13:17.112
I could just keep her forever.

13:17.146 --> 13:21.166
She is just the sweetest
little baby ever born.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.984
- Yes, she is.
- Oh.

13:23.002 --> 13:26.788
I don't see much of Flynn.

13:26.822 --> 13:29.124
That car of his keeps
him pretty busy.

13:29.158 --> 13:31.710
Yeah.

13:31.761 --> 13:35.047
More importantly,
how are you doing?

13:35.098 --> 13:36.298
I'm okay.

13:36.332 --> 13:38.333
How's the therapy?

13:38.351 --> 13:42.104
I know Dave helped me so much

13:42.138 --> 13:44.839
when I was going
through my little...

13:44.857 --> 13:46.775
How's your guy? Um...

13:46.809 --> 13:47.842
- Peter.
- Peter.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.228
He's, um, yeah, he's good.

13:50.279 --> 13:53.732
I feel like I'm
making progress.

13:53.783 --> 13:55.033
That's great.

13:55.068 --> 13:59.071
You know, you just keep
working through it.

14:03.409 --> 14:06.694
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, honey.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.831
Babe, what is it?

14:09.865 --> 14:12.084
It's okay. It's all right.

14:12.135 --> 14:14.536
Just-- Why don't you let me take Holly,
and then we'll talk about this?

14:14.554 --> 14:15.887
No. No, no, no.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.389
Okay.
All right, that's fine.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.591
Then how about you
just talk to me?

14:19.642 --> 14:22.144
Just tell me what's going on.

14:22.178 --> 14:24.596
I just...

14:24.647 --> 14:27.482
I need to make
the right decision.

14:27.517 --> 14:29.985
I need them to be safe.

14:30.019 --> 14:31.603
The kids?

14:31.654 --> 14:34.823
They're safe.
Of course they are.

14:34.857 --> 14:37.859
I just miss them so much.

14:37.893 --> 14:39.661
I just want to be with them.

14:39.695 --> 14:42.447
Hey, you know we can bring them
back home anytime you want.

14:42.498 --> 14:44.249
No.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.500
They need to stay.

14:45.535 --> 14:49.588
But I just...

14:49.622 --> 14:51.623
I don't know what
to do here. I--

14:51.674 --> 14:55.743
Like, whatever I choose
is wrong.

14:58.047 --> 15:00.748
Skyler, you have to tell me
what's going on.

15:02.852 --> 15:06.388
I-- I know sometimes you...

15:06.422 --> 15:09.524
I know you think I have
a big mouth sometimes. I...

15:12.061 --> 15:14.112
But if you felt like you
couldn't talk to me,

15:14.147 --> 15:16.148
I don't know what I'd do.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.533
Okay. So...

15:18.568 --> 15:21.987
So what's this about the kids
not being safe?

15:22.038 --> 15:26.074
Safe from what?

15:26.108 --> 15:28.627
From us.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.413
From Walt and me.

15:31.447 --> 15:35.417
Like what?
Like you're bad parents?

15:35.451 --> 15:39.621
Because you're not.
Not even close.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.623
Marie,

15:41.641 --> 15:45.143
there are things you
just don't know.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.129
That if you knew,

15:48.147 --> 15:51.132
you'd never speak to me again.

15:53.352 --> 15:56.354
Try me.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.198
Okay. If you're
not gonna say it, I will.

16:06.249 --> 16:09.701
Skyler, you have to forgive
yourself for Ted.

16:09.752 --> 16:10.835
What?

16:10.920 --> 16:13.538
You can't keep
beating yourself up

16:13.589 --> 16:17.842
over some stupid little affair.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.427
Uh...

16:19.462 --> 16:21.463
- Walt told you.
- Please don't blame him.

16:21.497 --> 16:25.050
I practically forced him to, and
I wasn't gonna say anything.

16:25.101 --> 16:28.603
But I cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

16:28.638 --> 16:30.838
You have to forgive
yourself, Skyler.

16:30.856 --> 16:33.341
You were having
all these problems with Walt.

16:33.359 --> 16:36.278
And Ted is
a really good-looking man.

16:36.312 --> 16:41.533
You're only human.
Hell, I've even thought of, you know...

16:41.567 --> 16:46.854
I mean, not seriously, but I
totally get your temptation.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.241
Yeah.

16:52.962 --> 16:56.164
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.968
Oh, yeah.

17:00.002 --> 17:01.753
I feel better.

17:01.804 --> 17:04.472
Yeah.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.513
<i>For those who love</i>
<i>the taste but not the price,</i>

17:12.548 --> 17:14.733
<i>there's simulated caviar</i>

17:14.767 --> 17:16.351

17:22.942 --> 17:24.693
Ready to get back at it?

17:26.529 --> 17:28.246
<i>Unlike fish caviar--</i>

17:28.281 --> 17:29.897
We have breaking news
into our newsroom.

17:29.915 --> 17:33.067
We've just learned that police
are now expanding their search

17:33.085 --> 17:36.588
for a missing Mckinley County boy
after four days with no leads.

17:36.622 --> 17:41.242
Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.211
Authorities are extending
their search today

17:43.245 --> 17:46.548
east from Crownpoint to Hospah
and White Horse.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.600
Sharp was last seen
riding his dirt bike

17:48.634 --> 17:50.685
into the desert
behind his house.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.587
Investigators are asking any--

18:01.096 --> 18:04.115
Jesse, nothing can change this.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.619
Yeah. It's just
that kid's parents--

18:07.653 --> 18:11.289
I know. Believe me.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.375
I haven't been able to sleep
the past few nights

18:13.409 --> 18:15.460
just thinking about it.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.795
But, Jesse,

18:16.829 --> 18:20.131
now, finally, we're
self-sufficient.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.467
Finally we have everything
that we need,

18:22.501 --> 18:24.753
and no one to answer to
except ourselves.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.957
And in a year, year and a half,

18:29.975 --> 18:32.143
once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money,

18:32.178 --> 18:35.630
there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.266
Until then...

18:38.300 --> 18:40.101
We keep going.

18:40.135 --> 18:43.571
And we-- we run our business
our way

18:43.606 --> 18:46.608
and make sure that this
never happens again.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.197
Okay?

18:52.248 --> 18:54.582
Look.

18:54.617 --> 18:56.651
Listen, I'll-- I'll
finish this up.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.421
Why don't-- why don't you
go on home? Hmm?

18:59.455 --> 19:02.290
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

19:02.324 --> 19:05.293
Yeah.
I'll take care of this.

19:05.327 --> 19:08.680
You go on.

19:51.707 --> 19:54.726
Hey.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.010
Yeah, I was just leaving.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.516
All right.

20:25.174 --> 20:26.674
Hello?

20:26.709 --> 20:28.242
Walter?

20:28.260 --> 20:30.578
What are you doing here?

20:30.596 --> 20:32.714
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

20:34.016 --> 20:37.936
Might as well get this
over with. Come in. Join us.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.561
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:49.698 --> 20:51.149
Where's your cars?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.735
We parked around the block.

20:53.769 --> 20:55.987
You might consider
doing that as well.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.292
Okay.

21:11.453 --> 21:12.954
So what's going on?

21:12.972 --> 21:17.308
Just since this morning,
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.293
- What?
- The feds have been all over me.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.480
This has been going on
for a while now.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.065
Did they follow you here?

21:24.099 --> 21:25.800
No.
I said I threw them.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.571
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation

21:29.605 --> 21:31.489
dragging a bunch of cops,
Walter.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.325
It would be unwise.
How can you be so sure?

21:34.360 --> 21:35.693
Well, I've been doing this
a long time.

21:35.744 --> 21:37.278
It's pretty basic stuff.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.982
How long has this
been going on?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.985
Since about the time we
started this little venture.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.539
The DEA, in particular
your peach of a brother-in-law,

21:47.590 --> 21:50.208
has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

21:50.259 --> 21:52.710
And you're just
telling me this now?

21:52.761 --> 21:55.329
What, you didn't think this
information would be of interest?

21:55.347 --> 21:56.881
Wouldn't be germane?

21:56.932 --> 21:58.516
I've been handling it, Walter.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.935
We're sitting
on a thousand gallons

22:00.970 --> 22:04.305
of stolen methylamine. Jesus!
How can you be so irresponsible?

22:04.339 --> 22:05.890
Calm down, would you please?

22:05.941 --> 22:08.476
I can't believe that you
kept this from me. From us.

22:08.510 --> 22:09.510
Did you know about this?

22:09.528 --> 22:10.728
Mike just told me.

22:10.779 --> 22:13.197
And I said calm down.
I've got it under control.

22:13.232 --> 22:15.149
Oh, well, forgive me

22:15.183 --> 22:17.735
for not having
complete confidence.

22:17.786 --> 22:19.737
You know this can't
go on, right?

22:19.788 --> 22:21.188
Yeah, I know.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.791
And I've already decided.

22:23.826 --> 22:27.194
I'm out.

22:36.005 --> 22:39.707
Okay. Well...

22:39.725 --> 22:41.876
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.395
But I really don't see
any other way.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.047
Neither do I.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.565
Obviously, Jesse,

22:47.600 --> 22:51.319
you'll have to take over
the distribution end of things.

22:51.353 --> 22:54.439
Mike, I trust that you'll
bring Jesse up to speed

22:54.490 --> 22:56.491
on your side of the business?

22:56.525 --> 22:59.577
Yeah.
Um, about that.

23:00.729 --> 23:02.563
Actually, Mr. White, um...

23:04.083 --> 23:07.035
I'm out too.

23:08.871 --> 23:11.238
You're what?

23:12.741 --> 23:15.743
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.962
So, um...

23:18.013 --> 23:20.715
I'm retiring, I guess.

23:20.749 --> 23:24.769
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal,

23:24.803 --> 23:30.441
that methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

23:30.476 --> 23:33.861
And you're telling me that you're
willing to walk away from that?

23:33.896 --> 23:35.930
We're walking away
from the meth.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.482
Not the methylamine.

23:37.533 --> 23:40.485
Jesse and I will be taking our
two-thirds and we're selling it.

23:40.536 --> 23:44.372
I've got a connection, a guy I
knew from my time with Fring.

23:44.406 --> 23:48.159
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

23:48.210 --> 23:51.329
Mike's thinking we'll clear,
like, five million. Each.

23:51.380 --> 23:54.832
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.284
And those legacy costs
that you're so fond of,

23:57.302 --> 23:59.303
you won't have
to worry about anymore.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.123
And then I will be
going on my way.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.474
Jesse too.

24:04.476 --> 24:07.228
It's a solid plan.

24:07.262 --> 24:10.631
You can come in on this
with us.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.300
That'd be cool.

24:12.334 --> 24:17.271
'Course, you know, you are
free to hold onto your third

24:17.305 --> 24:20.908
and keep cooking.

24:24.279 --> 24:26.831
You'll be selling
to my competitors.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.701
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

24:29.752 --> 24:32.170
It's a big country, Walter.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.922
Whole lot of meth-heads.

24:34.957 --> 24:37.508
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

24:37.543 --> 24:40.161
And that's what you're gonna
sell out for?

24:40.179 --> 24:43.181
Pennies? Why?

24:43.215 --> 24:46.217
Five million isn't pennies.

24:46.268 --> 24:48.136
It's more money
than I've ever seen.

24:48.170 --> 24:51.139
And when it comes down to it,

24:51.173 --> 24:53.725
are we in the meth business?

24:53.776 --> 24:55.977
Or the money business?

25:08.225 --> 25:10.727
Relax, kid.
There's no one there.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.896
You sure?

25:12.930 --> 25:14.898
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

25:45.262 --> 25:47.230
Glad to see
you could make it out.

25:47.264 --> 25:49.466
I was surprised
to get your call.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.569
Good surprise, I hope.

25:52.603 --> 25:54.971
There's one gallon,
as discussed.

25:55.005 --> 25:57.607
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

25:57.641 --> 26:01.344
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

26:01.362 --> 26:02.896
All right.
That's fair enough.

26:02.947 --> 26:05.482
Shall we talk money?

26:05.516 --> 26:07.150
That one's free.

26:07.184 --> 26:10.153
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per...

26:10.187 --> 26:15.041
665 gallons, that's 9,975,000.

26:15.075 --> 26:18.328
Although I would prefer
you round it up to ten.

26:18.362 --> 26:21.965
Makes it easier
for my partner and I to split.

26:21.999 --> 26:22.999
Steep.

26:23.033 --> 26:26.869
Mm. We good?

26:28.222 --> 26:29.872
Yeah. I'll talk to my guys,
but I should be able

26:29.890 --> 26:31.207
to put together
that cash, yeah.

26:31.225 --> 26:32.425
Good.

26:32.476 --> 26:34.144
I gotta tell you,
this is worth it

26:34.178 --> 26:36.479
just to get that blue stuff
of yours off the market.

26:42.052 --> 26:44.854
The blue stuff will be
off the market, right?

26:48.275 --> 26:53.196
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666,

26:53.230 --> 26:56.232
that seems like an odd number.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.034
Two-thirds
of an even thousand, though.

26:58.068 --> 27:02.622
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

27:02.673 --> 27:05.258
That's not all
the methylamine, is it?

27:06.710 --> 27:10.630
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

27:10.681 --> 27:14.801
This other party wouldn't be
a problem for you.

27:14.852 --> 27:16.719
His territory
won't impact yours.

27:16.753 --> 27:18.104
You see, that doesn't
work for me.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.722
I'm not just buying this
for the supply.

27:19.756 --> 27:21.024
I'm buying this for the demand.

27:21.058 --> 27:23.926
I'm looking to increase
my market share here, Mike.

27:23.944 --> 27:26.112
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

27:26.114 --> 27:28.481
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue

27:28.532 --> 27:30.266
will be off the streets.

27:34.405 --> 27:39.158
All right. Here's
a new deal for you then.

27:39.210 --> 27:44.330
I'll pay you 15k a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

27:44.381 --> 27:48.284
Not a drop less.

27:48.302 --> 27:51.087
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

27:51.121 --> 27:54.257
Well then, no deal, Mike.

28:17.281 --> 28:20.316
Yes?

28:20.334 --> 28:23.419
Yes. I guess.

28:25.456 --> 28:27.707
I don't know.

28:27.758 --> 28:30.543
Why don't you come over here?

28:30.594 --> 28:34.380
To my house.

28:34.431 --> 28:36.666
Yes, seriously.

28:44.108 --> 28:45.141
Hey.

28:50.898 --> 28:53.683
Yo, you sure this is okay?

28:53.701 --> 28:55.401
She's not here.
Nobody's here.

28:58.072 --> 29:01.741
All right.
So, uh...

29:01.792 --> 29:03.076
Something's come up.

29:03.127 --> 29:05.361
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell,

29:05.379 --> 29:08.665
but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

29:10.501 --> 29:12.969
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares

29:13.003 --> 29:15.888
of the methylamine unless he
gets your share, too.

29:15.923 --> 29:19.375
He wants the entire
thousand gallons.

29:19.393 --> 29:21.877
Absolutely not.

29:21.895 --> 29:24.597
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

29:24.648 --> 29:26.766
But I've been thinking
about it,

29:26.817 --> 29:30.353
and it really makes sense.

29:30.387 --> 29:32.888
- Kinda.
- It does, does it?

29:32.906 --> 29:36.726
Look, when you, uh,
when you started this thing,

29:36.744 --> 29:39.228
did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

29:39.246 --> 29:41.397
I know for a fact
that you didn't.

29:41.415 --> 29:45.702
I know for a fact all you
needed was was 737,000,

29:45.736 --> 29:48.921
'cause you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

29:48.956 --> 29:53.543
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed,

29:53.577 --> 29:56.412
then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

29:56.430 --> 29:58.297
And we could have it tomorrow.

29:58.349 --> 29:59.966
We would be out.

30:00.017 --> 30:01.434
You could spend time
with your family.

30:01.468 --> 30:03.052
No more worrying
about them getting hurt

30:03.086 --> 30:04.937
or finding out
about everything.

30:04.972 --> 30:06.589
Isn't this what you've
been working for?

30:06.607 --> 30:09.142
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out.

30:09.193 --> 30:12.945
It's not selling out.
Yes, it is, Jesse.

30:12.980 --> 30:17.567
I ha-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

30:17.601 --> 30:21.237
And I will not
throw it away for nothing.

30:21.271 --> 30:25.124
I don't know how else
to say it, Mr. White.

30:25.159 --> 30:28.745
$5 million isn't nothing.

30:31.215 --> 30:35.218
Jesse, have you heard of a
company called "Gray Matter"?

30:35.252 --> 30:38.388
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it

30:38.422 --> 30:40.840
in grad school with a couple
of friends of mine.

30:40.891 --> 30:43.626
Actually, I was
the one who named it.

30:43.644 --> 30:46.345
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

30:46.397 --> 30:48.765
We had a couple
patents pending.

30:48.799 --> 30:51.300
But nothing earth-shattering.

30:51.318 --> 30:55.071
'Course, we all knew
the potential.

30:55.105 --> 30:57.857
Yeah. We were gonna take
the world by storm.

31:00.327 --> 31:03.029
And then...

31:03.080 --> 31:06.666
This, uh-- Well, something
happened between the three of us.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.786
And I'm not gonna go
into detail.

31:09.820 --> 31:12.622
But for personal reasons,

31:12.656 --> 31:14.373
I decided to leave the company.

31:14.425 --> 31:17.677
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.713
I took a buyout for $5,000.

31:20.764 --> 31:25.017
Now, at the time, that was
a lot of money for me.

31:26.804 --> 31:29.388
Care to guess what that
company is worth now?

31:29.440 --> 31:32.692
Millions?

31:32.726 --> 31:36.362
Billions, with a "B."

31:36.396 --> 31:39.949
2.16 billion
as of last Friday.

31:39.983 --> 31:42.535
I look it up every week.

31:42.569 --> 31:45.238
And I sold my share,

31:45.289 --> 31:47.707
my potential,

31:47.741 --> 31:51.661
for $5,000.

31:51.695 --> 31:55.832
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

31:55.866 --> 31:58.501
This isn't the same thing.

32:01.054 --> 32:03.973
Jesse, you asked me

32:04.007 --> 32:08.060
if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

32:08.095 --> 32:10.813
Neither.

32:10.848 --> 32:13.215
I'm in the empire business.

32:18.188 --> 32:20.523
I don't know.

32:20.557 --> 32:25.862
Mr. White, is a meth empire really
something to be that proud of?

32:40.243 --> 32:42.211
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

32:42.245 --> 32:44.430
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.265
Hey, Mrs. White.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.934
Good to see you.

32:47.968 --> 32:50.052
You have a lovely home.

32:50.086 --> 32:52.305
- I was just heading out.
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

32:52.356 --> 32:56.275
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
- Stay.

32:56.310 --> 32:59.478
Come on. It'll be fun.

32:59.530 --> 33:01.614
It's okay with us,
isn't it, Skyler?

33:01.648 --> 33:03.766
We don't have anything
special planned tonight.

33:08.121 --> 33:10.272
Yeah.

33:10.290 --> 33:12.158
Sure.

33:14.995 --> 33:17.129
Why not?

33:19.282 --> 33:21.751
See?

33:40.437 --> 33:43.155
Mm.

33:43.190 --> 33:46.475
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

33:46.493 --> 33:50.663
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

33:50.697 --> 33:53.783
My mom always
made them like that.

33:53.817 --> 33:55.985
You put lemon in there, too?

33:56.003 --> 34:01.156
They are from the Deli
at Albertson's.

34:01.174 --> 34:04.176
Oh.

34:04.211 --> 34:07.296
Oh. Well, uh,

34:07.330 --> 34:10.800
Good-- good work
on your shopping then.

34:10.833 --> 34:15.021
Because these are choice.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.871
I, uh, I eat a lot
of frozen stuff.

34:32.906 --> 34:35.858
It's usually pretty bad.

34:35.876 --> 34:38.411
I mean, the pictures are
always so awesome, you know?

34:38.462 --> 34:41.030
It's like, "hell yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

34:41.047 --> 34:44.867
And then you nuke it, and the
cheese gets all scabby on top,

34:44.885 --> 34:47.503
and it's like-- it's like
you're eating a scab.

34:47.536 --> 34:49.705
I mean, seriously,
what's that about?

34:49.723 --> 34:54.043
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

34:54.061 --> 34:56.879
You know?

35:06.940 --> 35:09.608
Yeah, it's bad.

35:12.996 --> 35:16.115
So, hey, uh, how's business?

35:16.166 --> 35:17.750
The car wash.

35:17.784 --> 35:21.087
Mr. White said it's
going really well.

35:21.121 --> 35:23.673
He was, like, you're a--
you're a great manager.

35:26.009 --> 35:27.677
He did, huh?

35:27.711 --> 35:30.880
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a--

35:30.914 --> 35:33.516
Like a machine.
Like, well-oiled.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.185
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

35:39.272 --> 35:41.423
What else did he
tell you about me?

35:43.259 --> 35:46.112
Oh, you know, just...
Just good stuff.

35:46.146 --> 35:48.647
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

35:48.699 --> 35:50.449
Um, we don't really
talk that much

35:50.484 --> 35:56.038
about, um, personal--
personal things.

35:56.073 --> 35:58.574
Hmm.

35:58.608 --> 36:02.444
Did you also tell him
about my affair?

36:20.013 --> 36:23.632
May I please be excused?

36:38.749 --> 36:41.250
You know my kids are gone?
Thank God.

36:42.669 --> 36:46.372
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

36:46.423 --> 36:50.509
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

36:50.544 --> 36:53.095
She made me kick my own kids
out of the house.

36:59.553 --> 37:02.471
She told me

37:02.505 --> 37:04.974
that she was counting the days

37:05.008 --> 37:06.842
until my cancer came back.

37:10.781 --> 37:13.866
My wife is waiting
for me to die.

37:16.536 --> 37:19.538
This business is all
I have left now.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.362
It's all I have.

37:31.201 --> 37:33.469
And you want to take
it away from me.

37:55.172 --> 37:59.375
I thought you might
try something stupid.

37:59.409 --> 38:01.961
- Look, Mike--
- Don't bother, Walter.

38:02.012 --> 38:04.297
Come join me in the office.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.217
I don't think so.

38:09.353 --> 38:10.803
That's not a request.

38:15.859 --> 38:18.594
Might as well get comfortable.

38:18.612 --> 38:20.780
This deal's going down
tomorrow. It's happening,

38:20.814 --> 38:22.398
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

38:22.432 --> 38:25.117
- Got it?
- Oh, so it's okay for you to steal my--

38:25.152 --> 38:27.770
And to ensure that,
you and I are gonna spend

38:27.788 --> 38:30.790
the rest of the night
together in this office.

38:30.824 --> 38:33.292
- Like it's my birthday.
- Mike--

38:33.327 --> 38:36.278
When the deal is done, you'll get your money.
I guarantee that.

38:36.296 --> 38:40.616
Let me cook it. I'll double
your five and you still walk.

38:40.634 --> 38:44.620
You know, I have never seen anybody
work so hard not to get $5 million.

38:44.638 --> 38:45.954
Mike, you need to listen to me.

38:45.973 --> 38:48.924
No, Walter. The last thing
I need to do

38:48.958 --> 38:51.627
is listen to you.
Now, sit down.

39:24.211 --> 39:25.845
All right.

39:25.879 --> 39:28.664
Walter, I've got
a bit of a quandary here.

39:28.682 --> 39:30.516
I've got something
I need to attend to

39:30.550 --> 39:32.501
before this deal happens.

39:32.552 --> 39:36.639
But for some reason, I don't trust
you alone with the methylamine.

39:37.724 --> 39:39.308
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

39:40.944 --> 39:42.695
You gotta be kidding.

39:42.729 --> 39:45.231
Stand up for me, please.

39:45.282 --> 39:48.617
Stand up.

39:48.652 --> 39:51.070
Turn around for me.

39:51.121 --> 39:52.688
Arms out to the side.

39:52.706 --> 39:54.523
Up.

40:09.056 --> 40:10.706
- Oh, man.
- Sit down.

40:12.976 --> 40:15.227
Sit down.

40:17.814 --> 40:19.849
Give me your wrist.

40:27.274 --> 40:28.691
Sorry.

43:18.912 --> 43:21.163
All righty. To what
do we owe the pleasure?

43:21.197 --> 43:25.501
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

43:27.236 --> 43:28.337
This should be good.

43:28.371 --> 43:30.072
Mr. Ehrmantraut
has become the subject

43:30.090 --> 43:32.074
of a vicious, relentless,

43:32.092 --> 43:36.712
and unwarranted
DEA persecution.

43:36.746 --> 43:39.247
Gomie, does that, uh,
that sound right to you?

43:39.266 --> 43:41.383
I have no idea what
he's talking about.

43:41.417 --> 43:42.918
Play it as cool
as you like, Fonzie.

43:42.936 --> 43:46.605
But we all know you've been
following my client day and night.

43:46.640 --> 43:49.191
The poor man can't even spend a few
minutes with his granddaughter

43:49.225 --> 43:51.727
without you guys quivering
in the bushes

43:51.761 --> 43:53.862
and peeping through
your little binoculars.

43:53.897 --> 43:57.599
It's-- Well, it's disturbing.

43:57.617 --> 44:03.038
And it's taken a toll on his
mental and physical well-being.

44:03.073 --> 44:05.407
Your client looks fine to me.

44:05.441 --> 44:09.962
Well, some hurts only show
on the inside.

44:09.996 --> 44:13.115
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

44:13.133 --> 44:16.785
Theoretically, these tails
you refer to would be

44:16.803 --> 44:18.253
completely within the bounds
of the law.

44:18.287 --> 44:19.838
We don't need a warrant
to follow somebody

44:19.889 --> 44:21.307
through a public place.
Theoretically.

44:21.341 --> 44:25.094
Yeah, that is, uh,
theoretically correct.

44:25.128 --> 44:29.348
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance

44:29.399 --> 44:32.634
like this amounts to stalking.

44:32.652 --> 44:34.903
Which is illegal.

44:34.938 --> 44:37.439
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting

44:37.473 --> 44:40.159
about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

44:40.193 --> 44:44.580
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

44:44.614 --> 44:48.200
So, I have filed for a
temporary restraining order

44:48.251 --> 44:52.454
against the DEA on behalf
of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

44:54.924 --> 44:58.160
Where'd you get
your law degree, Goodman?

44:58.178 --> 45:00.679
The same clown college
you got that suit?

45:00.714 --> 45:02.097
You know who likes this suit?

45:02.132 --> 45:05.684
Judge Papadoumian. She thinks
I'm a snappy dresser.

45:05.719 --> 45:07.720
You know what
Judge Papadoumian hates?

45:07.771 --> 45:12.191
Police harassment
of a senior citizen.

45:12.225 --> 45:14.109
Sorry.

45:14.144 --> 45:15.978
Expect a visit
from the sheriff, agents.

45:16.012 --> 45:18.564
You should have
your <i>ex parte</i> within the hour.

45:20.533 --> 45:21.984
Let's go.

45:30.243 --> 45:31.877
<i>What the hell kind of
judge would issue this thing?</i>

45:31.911 --> 45:33.495
<i>Papadoumian, man.</i>

45:33.529 --> 45:35.998
<i>She's like Ho Chi Minh.</i>

45:36.032 --> 45:37.499
<i>So what we do?</i>

45:37.533 --> 45:40.803
<i>Well, not a lot of choice,</i>
<i>you know? We back off.</i>

45:40.837 --> 45:44.673
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand
up, and Goodman knows it.</i>

45:44.707 --> 45:46.341
<i>I don't see what they're</i>
<i>playing at here,</i>

45:46.375 --> 45:48.877
<i>but if Ehrmantraut</i>
<i>wants a fight,</i>

45:48.912 --> 45:51.346
<i>he's gonna get one.</i>

45:51.380 --> 45:52.848
That was a hell of a gamble.

45:52.882 --> 45:53.899
Worked.

45:53.933 --> 45:57.019
Yeah, well, not for long.

45:57.053 --> 46:00.489
He's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed toute suite.

46:00.523 --> 46:03.992
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

46:04.027 --> 46:05.694
So have fun with that.

46:05.728 --> 46:08.580
How much time I got?

46:08.615 --> 46:11.333
Maybe 24 hours.

46:11.367 --> 46:12.835
It's enough.

46:12.869 --> 46:14.953
It better be.
Whatever you got planned,

46:15.004 --> 46:17.673
you best pull the ripcord
while you still have a chance.

46:31.604 --> 46:33.105
- Where is it?
- Mike--

46:33.139 --> 46:34.690
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

46:34.724 --> 46:36.475
You, sit down.

46:36.526 --> 46:38.260
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, okay?

46:38.278 --> 46:40.446
- I am gonna count to three.
- Mr. White's got an idea.

46:40.480 --> 46:41.613
- Mike, I'm serious.
- One.

46:41.648 --> 46:42.614
- Two.
- It's a great idea.

46:42.649 --> 46:44.316
Look, you get
your five million,

46:44.367 --> 46:46.601
we both do, and he gets
his methylamine, all right?

46:46.619 --> 46:49.488
Just hear him out.

46:53.776 --> 46:55.577
Is that true, Walter?

46:59.615 --> 47:02.801
Everybody wins.
