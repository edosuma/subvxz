00:02.730 --> 00:04.619
- (Aidan):
Last season...

00:04.700 --> 00:06.668
I want to be with you forever.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.629
- (Susanna):
When love finds you again,

00:08.700 --> 00:10.202
you will not run from it.

00:10.270 --> 00:11.806
- I'm not gonna pretend

00:11.870 --> 00:14.510
that what happened between us
didn't mean anything.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.400
- I want you to turn me.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.073
What did you do?

00:18.150 --> 00:20.141
- Run!

00:20.220 --> 00:22.279
- I love you.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.682
Something's different.
- I had a vision.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.787
My wolf.
He's still with me.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.612
(Werewolf growling)

00:28.690 --> 00:31.387
- Josh?

00:31.460 --> 00:33.497
- (Donna): You don't belong
in this plane.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.097
- I'm not going back to limbo.
- No, you're not.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.559
- I'll take you with me,
I'll leave you there.

00:38.630 --> 00:41.793
You don't know what I can do.
- Oh no, I do.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.804
(Sally screaming)

00:52.750 --> 00:54.445
Sally?

00:54.520 --> 00:56.318
- Mmm...

00:56.390 --> 00:58.586
- Did you take
the magazine?

00:58.650 --> 01:03.190
Where did you
put the magazine?

01:03.260 --> 01:04.682
- Shhh!

01:06.260 --> 01:08.194
(Sighing)

01:09.500 --> 01:11.867
- Oh. OK.

01:11.930 --> 01:16.800
We're still having
a "me" time, huh?

01:16.870 --> 01:19.601
(* New Age *)

01:19.680 --> 01:22.399
(Sighing)

01:27.620 --> 01:30.146
You should at least
schedule some treatments.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.688
I mean, since we're here.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.411
- Shhh...

01:38.260 --> 01:40.456
(Sighing)

01:42.430 --> 01:43.898
- You can't take
the magazine

01:43.970 --> 01:45.825
and not let me
have a salt scrub.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.501
(Sighing)

01:49.570 --> 01:51.504
(Panting)

01:51.570 --> 01:54.437
(Birds chirping)

01:56.950 --> 01:58.600
(Werewolf snarling)

02:05.990 --> 02:08.515
- (Aidan):
Nora!

02:10.460 --> 02:12.349
(Snarling)

02:22.470 --> 02:23.801
(Panting)

02:25.970 --> 02:28.132
(Panting)

02:29.880 --> 02:31.370
(Werewolf snarling)

02:31.450 --> 02:33.748
He's getting faster!

02:41.890 --> 02:43.426
(Bleating)

02:47.460 --> 02:49.269
(Bleating)

02:49.330 --> 02:51.628
(Growling)

03:00.380 --> 03:01.802
(Whimpering)

03:03.580 --> 03:04.979
- He's hurt!

03:05.050 --> 03:06.916
- He's fine!

03:06.980 --> 03:09.688
(Sighing)

03:11.850 --> 03:14.319
- Some people go to Italy
for their honeymoon.

03:14.390 --> 03:15.983
(Panting)

03:16.060 --> 03:17.789
I bait my husband
with a goat.

03:22.930 --> 03:25.820
(Groaning)

03:25.900 --> 03:29.609
- I'm gonna pick up
that shift tomorrow.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.434
- Thank you.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.729
I stopped by the house
and took out the trash.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.733
- This the only blood we have?
- Yeah.

03:35.810 --> 03:37.471
(Scoffing)

03:37.550 --> 03:39.678
- When you were
at the house,

03:39.750 --> 03:41.878
did you see
any sign of Sally?

03:41.950 --> 03:45.739
- No. Maybe she saw we weren't
there and... I don't know.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.879
How far can
she travel?

03:47.960 --> 03:49.951
I guess anywhere,
really, right?

03:52.090 --> 03:53.854
- Well, maybe she's
gone for good.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.898
- How can a ghost
be gone for good?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.894
- Lots of ways.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.029
- Did he do that to you?

04:00.100 --> 04:03.331
- Yeah, it's, um, it's
already healing, so...

04:03.410 --> 04:06.505
- And you really think
he's getting faster?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.002
(Chuckling)

04:08.080 --> 04:10.048
- Yeah, but you know what?

04:10.110 --> 04:13.045
I just need a
bigger head start.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.646
See, he knows these woods
better than I do by now.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.790
Come on!

04:16.850 --> 04:17.988
- It's been 3 months.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.519
It was bound to happen.

04:20.589 --> 04:22.012
When you're running him,

04:22.089 --> 04:23.524
do you think he knows?

04:23.590 --> 04:25.729
Does it still seem
like he knows it's you?

04:25.790 --> 04:27.451
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:27.530 --> 04:28.895
Josh is still in there.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.667
- You have to run him
3 times a day

04:30.730 --> 04:31.925
just to calm him down enough

04:32.000 --> 04:33.468
to get him back in the shed.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.666
- What do you expect?

04:34.740 --> 04:35.969
The guy is trapped,

04:36.040 --> 04:37.860
and he's scared
and he's panicked.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.738
I mean, imagine
what it would be--

04:39.810 --> 04:41.073
- I know! I try to.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.904
(Sighing)

04:42.980 --> 04:44.607
Every time I turn,

04:44.680 --> 04:46.944
I try to imagine what would
happen if the sun came up

04:47.020 --> 04:48.340
and I wasn't me again.

04:50.950 --> 04:53.487
But I never
get that far.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.689
But when you're the wolf,
you can't imagine anything else.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.649
- We're gonna get him back.
- How?

04:58.730 --> 05:01.700
We don't even know what did
this to him in the first place,

05:01.760 --> 05:03.762
so please tell me
how the hell you and 1

05:03.830 --> 05:05.423
are supposed
to get him back.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.895
(Woodpecker pecking)

05:10.910 --> 05:13.436
Every time I turn,
I reach out,

05:13.510 --> 05:16.548
and I think I'll
find my husband there,

05:16.610 --> 05:20.513
and this will all have
just been some bad dream.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.680
But this is our life.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.582
This is Josh's life,

05:25.650 --> 05:28.813
and it's starting
to feel like forever.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.530
- Hey, come here.
We're gonna find a way.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.589
- You really need
to take a shower.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.865
- Oh, you bet I do.

05:37.930 --> 05:38.863
- Yeah.

05:38.930 --> 05:40.796
(Both chuckling)

05:44.010 --> 05:46.604
- I never thought
to try this before.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.706
- Yeah, it's the only thing
that gets my knots out.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.715
- I really got into
the hot-stone treatments.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.612
It wasn't relaxing at first.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.945
It reminded me of how
too many of my friends died,

05:58.020 --> 06:00.887
but after a decade or so...

06:00.960 --> 06:02.826
- We should do that tomorrow.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.154
- Hmm, so we're still
gonna be here tomorrow?

06:05.230 --> 06:06.755
- Aren't we?

06:06.830 --> 06:09.561
- I don't know.
It's up to you.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.621
- It still surprises me,
you know,

06:11.700 --> 06:12.997
how nice you are to me.

06:13.070 --> 06:15.164
- Hmm... I wouldn't
call it "nice."

06:15.240 --> 06:17.902
I'd say "patient."

06:17.970 --> 06:21.600
- Well, yet here we are,

06:21.680 --> 06:25.901
letting scantily clad ladies
throw us around on the ground,

06:25.980 --> 06:28.642
and it's kind of fun.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.848
- Oh, it's a gas.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.981
This particular venue
is a very good choice.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.858
Well done.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.025
- I didn't bring us here.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.990
- No, I brought us here,

06:40.060 --> 06:43.792
but you made "here" this.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.931
We're kind of 50/50 that way.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.889
- I didn't
make this.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.166
I'm not Hermione
frickin' Granger.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.039
- I didn't say
you made it well.

06:54.110 --> 06:55.635
(Moaning)

06:55.710 --> 06:58.805
I liked your rustic room
on Lago de Como better,

06:58.880 --> 06:59.870
but here are.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.020
(Sighing)

07:03.720 --> 07:05.188
- I've done this before?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.558
(Donna laughing)

07:06.620 --> 07:09.157
- We've done all of this before.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.086
This is the
way it goes:

07:11.160 --> 07:14.050
You freak out,
I explain things,

07:14.130 --> 07:16.963
you make a happy place.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.964
Got it down to a science.

07:19.030 --> 07:20.191
- What?

07:20.270 --> 07:21.931
- Yes, sweetie.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.640
See, I was fine with here
as just the way it was,

07:24.710 --> 07:26.030
but you wanted out.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.271
Look, I get it.

07:27.340 --> 07:29.172
I've had centuries
to face the fact

07:29.240 --> 07:31.208
that I'm living
on borrowed time.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.648
But you, you're tenacious.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.718
- But it feels...

07:40.190 --> 07:43.182
- It feels real.

07:44.930 --> 07:48.059
You just don't wanna
think about where we are.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.577
(Crickets chirping)

08:02.650 --> 08:04.744
(Sighing)

08:04.810 --> 08:07.245
(* French for Rabbits singing
Claimed by the Sea *)

08:07.320 --> 08:10.540
** There are cockles
and broken glass *

08:10.620 --> 08:14.955
* Spread across the floor *

08:15.020 --> 08:16.829
* The door is wide open *

08:16.890 --> 08:20.599
* And the sand made drifts *

08:20.660 --> 08:23.766
* All down the hall *

08:23.830 --> 08:26.629
* Broken panes in the window *

08:26.700 --> 08:31.240
* Reflected light
in from the sky... *

08:32.840 --> 08:34.638
- It's you.

08:34.710 --> 08:37.179
* This is no longer my house *

08:37.250 --> 08:42.120
- *1It's been
claimed by the sea *

08:42.179 --> 08:43.716
- (Both): Hi.

08:46.390 --> 08:48.313
(Sighing)

08:48.390 --> 08:50.779
- How long do we have?

08:50.860 --> 08:52.157
- Maybe 30 minutes.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.528
- Let's get out of here.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.862
* A starfish is dying *

08:57.930 --> 09:01.798
* Down by the laundry *

09:01.870 --> 09:03.929
(Both moaning)

09:04.010 --> 09:07.674
* Ironically the
washing machine *

09:07.740 --> 09:14.612
* Is half full of seawater... *

09:20.420 --> 09:24.880
(Both panting)

09:26.290 --> 09:30.329
* By the sea *

09:37.870 --> 09:40.100
* Claimed by the sea **

09:43.380 --> 09:45.109
- I'm happy to explain it again.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.773
It's like a bedtime story.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.683
Sometimes we both doze off
during the familiar parts.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.844
- Yeah. No, I understand
that we're connected.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.059
You ate me.
I broke you.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.680
What I don't understand

09:56.760 --> 10:00.253
is why you would drag me down
this particular rabbit hole.

10:00.330 --> 10:01.650
- To save the world.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.721
- Ah! OK, yeah.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.100
That's a really healthy
ego you got over there.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.401
Has anyone ever told you you'd
make a fantastic cult leader?

10:10.470 --> 10:11.960
- I'm serious!

10:12.040 --> 10:14.680
There are only so many
times you can go around

10:14.740 --> 10:16.276
popping holes
in the universe

10:16.340 --> 10:18.843
before the whole
thing falls to pieces.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.413
It's taken too many centuries
and too many souls

10:21.480 --> 10:23.812
for me to understand
that I've abused my power.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.416
And you know what? Like it
or not, sweetie, so have you.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.709
- Because I ripped
my way out of you?

10:28.790 --> 10:30.758
- No!
- That was survival!

10:30.830 --> 10:31.956
- No, that was smart.

10:32.030 --> 10:34.158
We have dodged
too many deaths.

10:34.230 --> 10:35.994
That's why it benched us.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.869
Do you remember
I asked you

10:37.930 --> 10:40.433
what happens if
you destroy a death spot?

10:40.500 --> 10:42.867
This is what
happens, all right?

10:42.940 --> 10:45.910
You can consider it
kind of a holding cell,

10:45.970 --> 10:47.779
as if we're criminals,

10:47.840 --> 10:50.172
which, in fact, we are.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.105
- Right, well,
if there was such a thing

10:52.180 --> 10:54.774
as an "upsetting the balance
of the universe" prison,

10:54.850 --> 10:56.887
you would be
in solitary.

10:56.950 --> 10:59.180
You would not be sharing
a cell with me.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.185
I am like a white-collar
criminal compared to you.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.058
I'm just trying to help people.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.191
- What do you think
I used to tell myself?

11:07.260 --> 11:10.195
I know that you
don't wanna hear it,

11:10.270 --> 11:12.193
but we share more than you know.

11:12.270 --> 11:13.965
And you have power.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.463
It is not safe for you
to be driving blind topside.

11:16.540 --> 11:19.464
- It's not up to you
to decide that.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.929
- I admit that I have
underestimated you before.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.478
- Mm-hmm.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.076
- But you do not strike me
as the kind of person

11:26.150 --> 11:27.879
who has a healthy dose of fear,

11:27.950 --> 11:29.816
which is required
to take precautions,

11:29.890 --> 11:32.086
or to, you know,
think for half a beat

11:32.150 --> 11:34.187
before doing something
really stupid.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.686
- And how long do you plan
on keeping us down here?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.889
- Forever.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.429
Or till I figure out
a way to end us.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.038
- (Whispering):
It's starting.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.813
I should go.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.740
- I'll see you
in the morning.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.726
- We'll be all right.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.262
- I love you.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.219
- I love you.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.414
(Howling in distance)

12:37.350 --> 12:40.980
(Crickets chirping)

13:25.400 --> 13:29.394
- What's the latest
with your people?

13:29.470 --> 13:31.609
- "My" people?

13:31.670 --> 13:34.605
They've been
strangely quiet.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.479
Anyone who needed
inoculations has got them,

13:37.550 --> 13:39.439
and the virus has
run its course.

13:39.510 --> 13:42.013
(Owl hooting)

13:45.520 --> 13:48.455
- It's hard for Nora
to look at me.

13:53.430 --> 13:58.300
After the first month,
when I turned back into myself.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.169
I thought:
"Thank God, it's over."

14:03.310 --> 14:05.506
And then morning came...

14:07.180 --> 14:11.174
and the wolf
ripped me apart again.

14:11.250 --> 14:14.914
And I realized, no...

14:17.550 --> 14:19.587
I'm on a runaway train.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.381
There are glimpses,
when I understand,

14:22.460 --> 14:24.383
when I see you and Nora,

14:24.460 --> 14:26.849
and I know it's you.

14:28.560 --> 14:33.589
And then I'm yanked back down.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.337
And then I'm just...

14:39.340 --> 14:41.274
the beast.

14:41.340 --> 14:45.345
So last month,
when the moon rose,

14:45.410 --> 14:48.118
when I held onto Nora...

14:49.580 --> 14:51.344
and I...

14:52.750 --> 14:55.014
tasted her tears
when we kissed,

14:55.090 --> 14:58.390
that's when it all
became clear.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.491
No one should have to live
with a burden like me.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.220
- OK.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.961
- And that's why
I asked you.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.269
- No.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.035
- And that's why.
- No.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.169
- That's why I need
you to kill me.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.299
- And I said no.
No way.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.576
- The silver knife,
I know you keep it here.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.575
- I keep it for emergencies.
- This is an emergency!

15:19.650 --> 15:21.311
I'd be saving both of you!

15:21.380 --> 15:23.189
- What?
- How do you even do it,

15:23.250 --> 15:24.718
running me ragged
while trying

15:24.790 --> 15:27.452
to keep your job and
the house at the same time?

15:27.520 --> 15:31.184
And Sally, maybe she's fine or
maybe she's trying to reach you.

15:31.260 --> 15:32.455
- Hey, wait a second!

15:32.530 --> 15:34.658
- But she can't,
because you're out here,

15:34.730 --> 15:36.289
wasting your
time with me!

15:37.630 --> 15:39.189
- Josh.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.932
- This is an emergency.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.118
(Sighing)

15:54.180 --> 15:56.979
- All right?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.285
- What am I gonna do?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.329
(Bird whooping)

16:15.600 --> 16:18.809
That's pretty cool. You were
just gonna let me do it, huh?

16:18.870 --> 16:22.408
- Hey, man, when you spend over
a century contemplating suicide,

16:22.480 --> 16:25.199
you learn to read these things.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.615
Nora, she's strong
and she's brave,

16:29.680 --> 16:33.287
but without that hope
that you will return to her,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.454
where will her
humanity go?

16:35.520 --> 16:38.251
- I know. I know.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.550
But how long can
the two of you contain me?

16:41.630 --> 16:45.168
How long until
I outrun you?

16:47.740 --> 16:51.734
If, God forbid,
I endanger someone...

16:53.440 --> 16:57.502
will you be able to do
what you know you have to do?

16:59.550 --> 17:03.180
You have the best
intentions, I know.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.048
You tried to save Kenny.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.654
But he was too far gone.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.185
And maybe I will
be, too, soon.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.125
(Sighing)

17:24.470 --> 17:26.564
- Does Nora know how
you feel about this?

17:26.640 --> 17:29.234
Have you talked
to her about this?

17:29.310 --> 17:30.800
- I have half
an hour with her

17:30.880 --> 17:33.372
before I have to lock
her up for the night.

17:33.450 --> 17:35.316
I can't talk to
her about this.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.145
(Cell phone vibrating)

17:38.220 --> 17:41.087
- Oh, just a second.
I'm sorry.

17:42.490 --> 17:44.254
- Was it Kat?
- Yes, it is Kat.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.456
- What do you tell her?

17:45.530 --> 17:47.726
How do you explain
where you are?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.655
- It's a very
important conversation!

17:49.730 --> 17:50.868
- Life is important.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.398
Your life is important,

17:52.470 --> 17:54.290
any semblance
of a human life.

17:54.370 --> 17:55.895
She shouldn't
have to suffer

17:55.970 --> 17:58.610
at the hands of whatever
the hell we are.

17:58.670 --> 18:00.274
- Who says she suffer--

18:00.340 --> 18:02.138
(Cell phone vibrating)

18:02.210 --> 18:04.850
- What are you missing?

18:04.910 --> 18:07.277
- Nothing. It's a
stupid faculty thing.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.819
She doesn't even wanna
go to it, Josh, so...

18:09.880 --> 18:11.780
- Yeah, that's
why she needs you.

18:11.850 --> 18:14.160
(Scoffing)

18:14.220 --> 18:15.813
Just go, man.
- I'm not going.

18:15.890 --> 18:16.812
- You have to go.

18:16.890 --> 18:17.857
- I'm not gonna go.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.455
- You have to salvage this.

18:19.530 --> 18:20.497
- I'm definit--

18:20.560 --> 18:23.495
- I'm fine.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.221
It just takes me a minute
to acclimate, you know?

18:26.300 --> 18:31.261
And you are very
high-maintenance vampire,

18:32.970 --> 18:35.905
and I just don't have
the energy right now

18:35.980 --> 18:38.540
required to deal
with your nonsense.

18:38.610 --> 18:39.873
(Chuckling)

18:39.950 --> 18:41.679
I need to be alone.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.616
(Laughing)

18:45.990 --> 18:47.617
I'll see you
next month.

18:47.690 --> 18:50.284
- Look, man, we're gonna
fix you long before that.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.220
- You gonna go or...?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.893
- OK! OK, T'll go.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.979
- I'll see you next month.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.518
(Bird hooting)

19:14.580 --> 19:16.742
- You're saying that
destroying my death spot

19:16.820 --> 19:18.481
erases my way home.

19:20.050 --> 19:22.712
But you and
I are linked,

19:22.790 --> 19:25.282
and you dragged me down
through my death spot.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.489
That's gotta mean
I get out through yours.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.961
Well, I guess
I gotta find it then.

19:32.030 --> 19:35.534
- You see? This is exactly
why you belong down here.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.500
You don't know
what you're doing.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.231
- But I do.
I made all this.

19:41.340 --> 19:43.502
That means I can
take it all away.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.344
(Water dripping)

19:45.410 --> 19:47.378
(Sighing)

19:49.850 --> 19:52.740
(Crashing)

20:05.500 --> 20:07.832
(Grunting)

20:09.900 --> 20:12.403
- I'm doing this
for your own good.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.699
(Grunting)

20:18.910 --> 20:20.674
(Panting)

20:30.590 --> 20:32.684
Sally!

20:34.130 --> 20:35.859
Sally!

20:37.600 --> 20:38.999
Sally, no!

20:41.370 --> 20:43.532
(Choking)

20:56.780 --> 20:59.044
- (Woman on PA):
Attention, shoppers.

20:59.120 --> 21:02.385
A flash sale in the
ladies' wear department starts

21:02.460 --> 21:03.359
in 30 seconds.

21:10.630 --> 21:13.361
(Shoppers talking, indistinct)

21:14.670 --> 21:16.593
- (Woman): Devil!

21:16.670 --> 21:19.105
Yet another devil
come to curse us!

21:19.170 --> 21:21.002
- What's happening?

21:21.080 --> 21:23.799
- You will not walk with us,
devil! We will burn you first!

21:23.880 --> 21:26.906
- (Girl): May God
strike you dead!

21:26.980 --> 21:28.118
- Thou unclean one!

21:28.180 --> 21:29.739
- Out! Out, devil woman!

21:29.820 --> 21:31.640
Stand back!
Protect yourself.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.484
- Do you know how
to get this off?

21:33.560 --> 21:34.857
- Do not look
on the devil!

21:34.920 --> 21:36.115
- OK, so no, then?

21:36.190 --> 21:37.783
- (Woman):
Die, already! Die!

21:37.860 --> 21:39.885
- (Man):
Suffer, witch! Suffer!

21:39.960 --> 21:41.894
- Donna's death spot
was in a Shopmart?

21:41.960 --> 21:43.496
- (Woman):
Nothing but evil!

21:43.570 --> 21:44.969
- (Women): Witch!

21:45.030 --> 21:46.100
- (Man): Repent!

21:46.170 --> 21:47.990
- Screw this noise.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.479
I did it.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.600
I did it!

21:57.680 --> 22:00.069
*Ididit, I did it
Ididit, I did it *

22:00.150 --> 22:03.586
*Ididit, I did it
Ididit, I did it *

22:03.650 --> 22:05.982
*Ididit, I did it *

22:06.050 --> 22:08.849
All right, how the hell
do I get home?

22:08.920 --> 22:11.059
(Man laughing)

22:11.130 --> 22:12.450
(Sighing)

22:12.530 --> 22:15.022
(* Piano playing jazz *)

22:15.100 --> 22:16.829
- (Man):
Margaret, come here!

22:16.900 --> 22:19.062
= Hello.
Nice to see you.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.120
- Ah! Thank you.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.066
- Hey, how are you?

22:22.140 --> 22:24.063
- If I could inject
this into my veins,

22:24.140 --> 22:25.608
I would be
a lot better.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.672
- Uh-huh! Another
scintillating conversation

22:27.740 --> 22:28.901
with Dean Whitman's wife.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.470
I'm sorry to interrupt.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.609
Did she get you to join
her awesome book club?

22:32.680 --> 22:34.944
- Her need to be the
smartest person in the room

22:35.020 --> 22:36.476
has reached
epic proportions.

22:36.550 --> 22:37.779
- Will you buy more

22:37.850 --> 22:39.739
of her granddaughter's
Girl Scout cookies?

22:39.820 --> 22:41.618
'Cause I could
murder some Tagalongs.

22:41.690 --> 22:44.580
- I said that you and I would go
with the dean's wife

22:44.660 --> 22:46.128
and talk to the dean...

22:49.630 --> 22:51.064
Earth to Aidan!
- Hmm?

22:51.130 --> 22:52.461
- Hey!

22:52.530 --> 22:53.668
- Um, Dean Whitman.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.435
Oh, uh, yeah! Totally.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.003
If you were to give me
just 5 minutes alone outside,

22:58.070 --> 22:59.538
I will come back,

22:59.610 --> 23:01.430
and I will charm the
pants off Dean Whitman.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.636
- (Both): Mmm!

23:02.710 --> 23:03.848
- And his wife.

23:03.910 --> 23:05.139
- Gross.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.122
(Exhaling sharply)

23:26.630 --> 23:28.769
(Sighing)

23:42.680 --> 23:44.648
- (Aidan): Susanna!

23:44.720 --> 23:46.939
(Women screaming)

23:52.060 --> 23:54.028
(Breathing unevenly)

24:03.070 --> 24:04.731
- Hi.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.268
- I was just admiring
your bracelet.

24:07.340 --> 24:09.729
- Oh, thank you.
It was my grandmother's.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.199
It's like one of those
things that's so old,

24:12.280 --> 24:13.645
it's back in style now.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.609
- I used to have
one very similar.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.148
I'm sorry now
that I lost it.

24:17.220 --> 24:19.882
- -I'mKat.
History department.

24:19.950 --> 24:22.282
- Diana. I'm just
doing some research.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.624
- Oh, um, what area?

24:24.690 --> 24:26.886
- I think I'm still
circling that.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.291
Don't tell my
thesis advisor.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.670
(Chuckles)

24:30.730 --> 24:33.028
Your date seems
very doting.

24:33.100 --> 24:34.636
- Oh, Aidan.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.668
He is quite
the gentleman.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.902
Granted, he suddenly
disappeared, uh,

24:38.970 --> 24:42.702
but I'll allow some boorish
behaviour at a faculty mixer.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.306
- Sorry, but I couldn't help
notice the two of you.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.848
Everyone else here is...

24:46.910 --> 24:49.174
- Wearing tweed,
making jokes about Chaucer,

24:49.250 --> 24:51.048
stealing Dean
Whitman's good scotch?

24:51.120 --> 24:53.043
- Yes, all of those.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.057
I'm new in town, so I think
I still feel a bit at sea.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.658
- You should come hang with us.
I was just about to go find him.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.095
I can't promise you

25:02.160 --> 25:04.322
that Aidan won't bust out
the Old English, though.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.061
He does like
a good party trick.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.689
- OK, T'll see
you out there.

25:07.770 --> 25:08.692
- OK, bye.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.974
(Sighing)

25:17.180 --> 25:18.102
There you are.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.579
- Sorry I took so long.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.015
It's just work called,

25:21.080 --> 25:23.344
and they turned my shift
tonight into a double.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.115
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.818
- Either you and Nora are
the greatest nurses of all time,

25:27.890 --> 25:29.881
or no one else
works at that hospital.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.587
- We are incredibly skilled.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.129
- I was just talking to
this woman, and she was nice.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.953
I was gonna drag her over
to the dean's table with us.

25:37.030 --> 25:40.159
It's weird, She was
right behind me.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.959
(Kat chuckling)

25:42.040 --> 25:44.737
(Crickets chirping)

25:44.810 --> 25:47.131
(Bird squawking)

25:54.720 --> 25:57.075
(Bird hooting)

26:25.980 --> 26:28.972
(Howling in distance)

26:35.290 --> 26:38.260
(Both panting)

26:39.730 --> 26:42.119
- Come here.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.965
(Kat squeals)

26:53.040 --> 26:54.235
(Moaning)

26:58.180 --> 27:01.343
Susanna, what--what is this?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.377
- I'm here, baby.
I'm here.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.043
- I don't understand.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.713
- Isn't it wonderful?

27:06.790 --> 27:08.087
- Kat was right here.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.356
- I know.
She's lovely.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.060
She's so warm.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.794
I understand.

27:16.860 --> 27:20.694
I understand everything.
Think of our history.

27:20.770 --> 27:24.809
- It's my fault. Everything that
happened to us is all my fault.

27:24.870 --> 27:27.339
And I never had a
chance to tell you how...

27:27.410 --> 27:29.333
that I am so sorry.

27:29.410 --> 27:32.107
- It's ancient
history, my love.

27:32.180 --> 27:33.409
Ancient history.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.346
(Sighing)

27:35.420 --> 27:37.115
Don't stop.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.319
(Moans)

27:44.430 --> 27:45.750
- Aidan?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.423
- (Sally): Aidan.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.367
(Gasps)

27:51.430 --> 27:53.228
(Laughing)

27:53.300 --> 27:54.495
- Sally?

27:54.570 --> 27:56.231
- There he is.
- Oh!

27:56.300 --> 27:57.392
- Ah!

28:02.210 --> 28:04.872
- Seriously, I don't how
I can logically explain to you

28:04.950 --> 28:07.169
that I dove through
a funnelling pool of blood,

28:07.250 --> 28:09.241
I popped up through
a witch's death spot,

28:09.320 --> 28:11.140
and then I was birthed
into a Shopmart.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.439
You are, like, 1,001 years
old and guzzle blood.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.410
I just figured that maybe you
could go with me on this one.

28:16.490 --> 28:18.128
- I'm just saying
this is weird!

28:18.190 --> 28:19.123
- Yes, it is!

28:19.190 --> 28:20.487
- It's crazy, Sally!

28:20.560 --> 28:22.528
OK, you're back,
but do you feel different?

28:22.600 --> 28:24.864
If what Donna said is true,
does that mean--

28:24.930 --> 28:26.398
- I'm gonna stop
you right there,

28:26.470 --> 28:28.029
because that's
crazy talk.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.137
- You just said you spent
3 months chatting it up

28:30.200 --> 28:31.338
with a witch in a day spa!

28:31.410 --> 28:33.230
- Yeah, I made that day spa.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.870
Apparently I make things to
not think about other things.

28:35.940 --> 28:38.910
- So you're either delusional
or you're very powerful or both.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.539
Do you remember--
- I'm back!

28:40.610 --> 28:44.080
I'm back. That is all
I care about right now.

28:44.150 --> 28:46.539
(Chuckling)

28:46.620 --> 28:48.315
- OK, you're back.
Yes! You're back.

28:48.390 --> 28:50.950
And it's awesome you're back.
I'm happy you're back.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.021
- I know!

28:53.090 --> 28:54.455
- But if what Donna
said is true,

28:54.530 --> 28:56.294
if you're not
supposed to be here...

28:56.360 --> 28:57.828
- Wow!

28:57.900 --> 28:59.789
- ...then it's not safe
for you to be here!

28:59.870 --> 29:01.429
- Oh my God! I know
it's really easy

29:01.500 --> 29:03.195
to believe a woman
with a head wrap!

29:03.270 --> 29:04.203
- What?

29:04.270 --> 29:06.102
- I'm just saying,

29:06.170 --> 29:08.935
why would we believe anything
she's saying at this point?

29:09.010 --> 29:10.569
- Because she
hasn't lied, Sally.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.302
Well, exactly,
she hasn't lied. Exactly!

29:13.380 --> 29:15.917
I mean, yes, she manipulated
events to her favour,

29:15.980 --> 29:17.277
but as I understand it,

29:17.350 --> 29:19.318
wasn't she always a
straight shooter, sort of?

29:19.390 --> 29:21.188
- Of fireballs, yes.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.887
Look, I am here right now.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.179
We are here, talking finally...
- That's not my point!

29:25.260 --> 29:27.922
- ...Which, after everything
that I've been through,

29:28.000 --> 29:29.320
seems like a miracle.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.061
Can't we focus on
endless possibilities

29:31.130 --> 29:33.064
instead of worst-case scenarios?

29:33.130 --> 29:35.235
- Yes!

29:35.300 --> 29:36.995
- Where's Josh?

29:37.070 --> 29:39.209
I know he's not here,
because the fridge is bare,

29:39.270 --> 29:42.137
and the magazines aren't in
their crazy-person fan display.

29:42.210 --> 29:43.803
Can I see him?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.707
- Yes.

29:49.150 --> 29:53.144
(Woman): ** I've been walking
in circles for days *

29:53.220 --> 29:58.954
* Wandering in and out
of this haze *

29:59.030 --> 30:02.125
* Nothing is clear *

30:02.200 --> 30:05.261
* Except nothing
stays the same *

30:05.330 --> 30:10.234
* I know, know
no one's to blame *

30:10.300 --> 30:15.101
* But I don't
Don't wanna play this game *

30:15.180 --> 30:18.878
* Without you, I can't *

30:18.950 --> 30:22.511
*T won't *

30:22.580 --> 30:25.447
(Man and woman):
* Everybody says get over it *

30:25.520 --> 30:27.284
(Sighing)

30:27.350 --> 30:30.888
* Get over it... *

30:30.960 --> 30:32.553
- I wish we had more time.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.120
<i>- I know.</i>

30:34.200 --> 30:35.429
(Sighing)

30:35.500 --> 30:37.127
I don't want you
to see me, though.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.070
I want you to
remember me like this.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.938
- I can't say
goodbye anymore.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.536
I just want it
to be us again.

30:47.610 --> 30:48.634
<i>- I know.</i>

30:50.110 --> 30:52.841
- And I feel like
I'm failing you.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.270
I know that I
shouldn't say that.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.842
I wanna have
all the answers.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.486
But I'm getting scared.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.426
* More than I can take... *

31:04.490 --> 31:06.686
- We'll figure it out.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.424
OK? We always do.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.568
Please don't worry.

31:13.630 --> 31:17.965
* And everybody says
get over it *

31:18.040 --> 31:19.303
* Get over it *

31:19.370 --> 31:20.462
You should go.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.179
You should go.

31:23.240 --> 31:27.450
* Everybody says get over it *

31:27.510 --> 31:30.241
* But I know that
they're wrong *

31:32.150 --> 31:34.551
* They're wrong *

31:36.590 --> 31:39.025
* Yeah, they're wrong *

31:40.330 --> 31:43.300
* So wrong *

31:44.670 --> 31:51.463
* Yeah, they're wrong **

31:51.540 --> 31:54.475
(Birds chirping)

32:03.820 --> 32:05.743
- Hey, Nora,

32:05.820 --> 32:11.020
you are never gonna believe who
I just found haunting our house.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.298
- Aaah! Yep, yep!

32:14.360 --> 32:16.226
- Oh my God! Hi!

32:16.300 --> 32:18.769
Oh my God! I wish
I could hug you!

32:18.830 --> 32:21.367
What happened to you?
Where have you been?

32:21.440 --> 32:22.999
- It's a long story.

32:23.070 --> 32:24.469
Aidan just told me

32:24.540 --> 32:26.360
your whole Ladyhawke
situation with Josh.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.637
I don't even know what to say.
"Sorry" seems so useless.

32:29.710 --> 32:31.144
- I know, It's, uh...

32:31.210 --> 32:33.372
- Well, would you
like to see him?

32:33.450 --> 32:35.077
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:37.850 --> 32:40.114
So, I can't see Josh...
- You can see him.

32:40.190 --> 32:42.056
- ...real Josh, till
the next full moon?

32:42.120 --> 32:44.259
That's crazy!

32:44.330 --> 32:45.650
- He's gone.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.357
Aidan!

32:49.330 --> 32:50.559
- Awesome!

32:50.630 --> 32:53.463
OK, well, uh, I'm just
gonna go be bait!

32:53.530 --> 32:57.262
Nora, we're probably gonna
need the "trank” gun.

33:00.570 --> 33:03.107
Have you seen him?

33:03.180 --> 33:04.272
- I lost him.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.579
- Oh my God!

33:05.650 --> 33:07.448
- Nora, you
shouldn't be here.

33:07.510 --> 33:09.569
- No, he won't hurt me.

33:09.650 --> 33:11.539
- You don't know
what he would do.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.440
- He's just scared!

33:13.520 --> 33:16.285
- He's scared and alone and
terrified of what he might do.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.055
That's why he wants
us to kill him!

33:18.130 --> 33:19.359
- What?

33:19.430 --> 33:21.797
- I probably shouldn't
have told you that.

33:21.860 --> 33:23.157
(Panting)

33:23.230 --> 33:25.267
- So that's what this is?

33:25.330 --> 33:27.059
(Panting)

33:27.130 --> 33:28.529
Oh my God!

33:28.600 --> 33:29.738
- Aidan.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.063
(Growling)

33:31.140 --> 33:33.131
- Get back! Get back!

33:35.240 --> 33:36.332
Josh?

33:36.410 --> 33:37.571
Uh...

33:37.640 --> 33:39.404
(Snarling)

33:39.480 --> 33:40.447
Josh.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.345
You know what?

33:47.420 --> 33:49.479
I'm not doing this!

33:49.560 --> 33:51.449
It's your move.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.759
(Snarling)

33:52.830 --> 33:54.559
- Stop!

33:56.160 --> 33:57.321
(Roaring)

33:57.400 --> 34:00.222
- Ah!

34:00.300 --> 34:02.029
(Moaning)

34:03.640 --> 34:04.766
(Grunts)

34:04.840 --> 34:06.103
Oh!

34:08.310 --> 34:09.232
- So, what the hell?

34:09.310 --> 34:10.630
- I don't know.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.199
I don't know
what that was.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.475
<i>- Sally, thank you!</i>

34:14.780 --> 34:17.215
Where did she go?

34:17.280 --> 34:18.610
(Werewolf snoring)

34:18.690 --> 34:20.340
- (Both): Sally!

34:20.420 --> 34:22.114
- Guys?

34:23.860 --> 34:25.658
Guys!

34:29.699 --> 34:31.121
Well, this is new.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.764
(Sighing)

34:41.340 --> 34:43.274
(Barn creaking)

34:43.340 --> 34:45.377
- Do you really wanna die?

35:24.250 --> 35:25.809
(Knocking)

35:25.890 --> 35:28.587
- Hello, Blake.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.527
- Aidan! It's
been a while.

35:31.590 --> 35:34.560
- Hmm! What are you
doing in my hospital?

35:34.630 --> 35:36.598
- You know those rules
don't exist anymore.

35:36.660 --> 35:39.322
- Oh, look who knows
Boston politics.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.869
- I'd tell you to take it up
with the new regime,

35:41.940 --> 35:44.204
but I know how you
hate to get involved.

35:44.270 --> 35:45.863
(Sighing)

35:45.940 --> 35:47.704
Relax!

35:47.770 --> 35:49.329
No one's building
a vampire army.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.344
We've barely got enough
for a bocce game.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.549
We're just trying to
get back to status quo.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.419
- OK, shhh!

35:55.480 --> 35:58.211
You were right the first time.
I don't wanna be involved.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.416
But Sapp & Sons? Really?

35:59.490 --> 36:00.616
- Well, you have to admit,

36:00.690 --> 36:02.579
it's really the cleanest way.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.958
- There's nothing
wrong with a funeral home,

36:05.030 --> 36:06.384
but that particular one,

36:06.460 --> 36:08.349
everyone that's ever
owned it is dead.

36:08.430 --> 36:10.626
- Except for you.
- Except for me.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.891
How did someone so ambitious
get stuck with the grunt work?

36:16.970 --> 36:18.836
- It has its benefits.
You should know.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.299
You and Bishop originated

36:21.380 --> 36:23.508
the whole blue-collar
cover, didn't you?

36:23.580 --> 36:27.471
- Oh yes! And it took a long
time to get that system.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.575
Hey, look, I've washed
my hands of this,

36:29.650 --> 36:31.641
but I still have
to live in this city,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.484
and I'd feel
better, at least,

36:33.550 --> 36:35.382
if I knew it was
being run right.

36:35.460 --> 36:39.385
So if you ever need to talk
or run some things by me,

36:39.460 --> 36:42.657
I could spare you
some of the mistakes.

36:42.730 --> 36:45.597
- Like I said,
it's been a while.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.593
That's because things
are going well,

36:47.670 --> 36:50.890
I thought you'd value your
freedom more than anything.

36:50.970 --> 36:53.507
I've got a short window
of time to turn them, so...

36:53.570 --> 36:54.878
- Yeah, you know what?

36:54.940 --> 36:56.374
I think we're gonna

36:56.440 --> 36:58.408
let the clock run
out on this one.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.800
- Aidan.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.279
- I'm sorry.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.273
Build your army.
I don't care.

37:03.350 --> 37:04.511
But have some respect.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.240
Don't do it here.

37:10.490 --> 37:12.822
(Sighing)

37:12.890 --> 37:13.823
(Exhaling sharply)

37:13.890 --> 37:15.221
You owe me one, pal.

37:17.630 --> 37:19.928
(Siren wailing)

37:21.470 --> 37:23.438
- Evening, Aunt Blake.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.663
(Sighing)

37:26.740 --> 37:29.710
- I really wish
you'd stop calling me that.

37:29.780 --> 37:32.545
- I'm sentimental.
That's all.

37:32.610 --> 37:34.442
Any news?

37:34.520 --> 37:36.773
- Nothing urgent.

37:38.050 --> 37:40.382
I updated your calendar.

37:40.450 --> 37:42.782
- Ah, fantastic!
Thank you.

37:44.060 --> 37:46.927
- I saw your father today.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.651
- Aidan?

37:48.730 --> 37:50.050
Where the hell
has he been?

37:50.130 --> 37:51.768
- I didn't ask.

37:51.830 --> 37:54.959
I was under the impression
that we didn't need him.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.259
- We don't.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.601
So, did you tell him?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.876
- That his little boy's
grown up to run Boston?

38:04.950 --> 38:06.099
No.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.875
- OK, good.

38:07.950 --> 38:10.009
I'd like to tell him
on my own terms.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.119
And Blake?

38:16.190 --> 38:17.749
(Sighing)

38:17.820 --> 38:20.721
You know, I hate to have
to keep telling you this,

38:20.790 --> 38:23.452
but really, if you keep
using that tone with me,

38:23.530 --> 38:25.498
there are gonna
be repercussions.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.561
I think you know that.

38:27.630 --> 38:30.031
- Yes. Of course!

38:31.540 --> 38:33.008
My apologies.

38:33.070 --> 38:34.731
- Awesome.

38:34.810 --> 38:35.902
(Chuckles)

38:39.980 --> 38:41.618
(Sighing)

38:56.700 --> 38:58.054
(Bird squawking)

38:58.130 --> 38:59.996
(Women chanting, indistinct)

39:22.560 --> 39:24.824
(Chanting continues)

39:24.890 --> 39:27.484
- What is this?

39:27.560 --> 39:30.200
- (Women): The blood of
the child revives us.

39:30.260 --> 39:33.662
The blood of the
child revives us...

39:33.730 --> 39:35.539
- Sorry to interrupt.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.501
I just sort of popped
in here, and I'm not...

39:38.570 --> 39:40.709
- (Women): The blood of
the child revives us.

39:40.770 --> 39:41.999
(Crying)

39:42.080 --> 39:44.174
The blood of
the child revives us.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.106
- Please, no!
Let me go! Please!

39:46.180 --> 39:49.571
- The blood of the
child revives us...

39:49.650 --> 39:51.118
- No. Stop!

39:51.180 --> 39:52.716
(Screaming)

40:02.730 --> 40:04.528
(Both sighing)

40:09.270 --> 40:11.034
- I love you.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.929
(Alarm buzzing)

40:15.010 --> 40:17.035
(Groaning)

40:23.080 --> 40:25.583
(Both sighing)

40:25.650 --> 40:27.140
Mmm!

40:28.920 --> 40:30.979
- Good morning.

40:31.060 --> 40:32.027
- Mm-hmm.

40:32.090 --> 40:33.956
I would like
to acknowledge

40:34.030 --> 40:36.749
that I just said some
very loaded words,

40:36.830 --> 40:40.494
and I don't want
things to get weird.

40:40.570 --> 40:41.696
- No, nothing's weird.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.966
- Neither of us
are 22, Aidan.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.702
We don't have to
dodge the conversation.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.848
Sometimes, when a lady has
the morning that I just did --

40:54.920 --> 40:57.173
you know, like,
a really super,

40:57.250 --> 41:00.049
bordering-on-
outstanding morning --

41:00.120 --> 41:01.588
things can slip out.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.152
- All right, OK,
so it just slipped out,

41:04.220 --> 41:05.483
and you didn't mean it.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.853
- OK, remember the morning
after Nora's wedding?

41:10.930 --> 41:12.068
- Yes.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.598
- I woke up at my place,

41:13.670 --> 41:15.991
half the night before
in a forgotten haze.

41:16.070 --> 41:19.665
Probably had something to do
with the unfortunate combination

41:19.740 --> 41:22.607
of a case of champagne
and a 5-person guest list.

41:22.680 --> 41:27.277
But when the fog of
my hangover lifted,

41:27.350 --> 41:30.172
the first thing that
I saw was your face,

41:30.250 --> 41:32.742
and it felt
really good.

41:32.820 --> 41:39.226
And that's when I knew
that I had gone from falling...

41:41.360 --> 41:43.556
to fallen.

41:43.630 --> 41:46.327
OK, so, yeah,
I meant it.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.765
I love you, Aidan.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.933
But I'm not gonna
cease to exist

41:52.010 --> 41:54.570
if you are not ready
to say it back.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.104
OK, I have
an early class.

42:00.180 --> 42:03.241
Uh, I am going
to jump in the shower,

42:03.320 --> 42:05.084
head on out,

42:05.150 --> 42:08.609
and, um,
I'll call you later.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.029
(Doorbell buzzing)

42:30.940 --> 42:32.749
- Aidan.

42:36.020 --> 42:37.772
It's me.

42:41.450 --> 42:43.987
