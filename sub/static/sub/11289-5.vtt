What? Oh, no, you..

00:31.566 --> 00:33.166
You are not about to kick me out

of my own bathroom,
so could you play frogman

00:35.966 --> 00:38.033

00:38.100 --> 00:41.433

With my bubble bath, my candles.

00:54.733 --> 00:57.033
Is that my robe?

00:57.100 --> 00:59.566
Uh, uh, you see, Tripp,

01:45.973 --> 01:49.273
God, I look drunk in this one.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.340
Look at you, mama,
your eyes are shut in this one.

01:51.406 --> 01:54.906
And, Lord, I don't know
what's going on in this one.

01:54.973 --> 01:57.973
Kinda look like the flash
kinda binked off your head.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.506
You know what I mean,
like a dome.

02:00.573 --> 02:02.513
I know you guys aren't
still pouring over those

02:02.580 --> 02:05.413
wedding proofs,
when a professional, <i>moi</i>

02:05.480 --> 02:08.246
has already advised you
on your selections.

02:08.312 --> 02:10.645
Well, advise this.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.580
I'm not paying for any photos

02:12.646 --> 02:14.080
where the wedding coordinator

02:14.146 --> 02:17.813
looks better than
the bride and the groom, hear.

02:17.879 --> 02:20.680
Okay, but you do realize
that's going to

02:20.746 --> 02:22.546
severely limit your options.

02:22.613 --> 02:23.880
Hmm.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.346
‐ Hey. Oh!
‐ Oh, no.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.580
Come on, hey, back off.
Open this door.

02:28.646 --> 02:30.246
Hey! Alright.

02:30.313 --> 02:32.413
Good news, good news, Khadijah.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.513
My favorite law school professor
is in town

02:34.580 --> 02:35.713
for a lecture series.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.713
You remember him?
Clayton Simmons?

02:39.046 --> 02:40.980
No.

02:41.046 --> 02:42.980
I mean, no‐uh, no, not really.

02:43.046 --> 02:45.946
I can't says I do.

02:46.013 --> 02:47.013
Come on,
I mean, you had lunch when

02:47.080 --> 02:48.546
that time you came to visit.

02:48.613 --> 02:52.280
Um, h‐h‐he was, uh, intelligent,
sophisticated, sexy?

02:52.346 --> 02:53.646
‐ My mentor.
‐ Ahh.

02:53.713 --> 02:56.513
You know, that's so wonderful to
be in touch with the teachers

02:56.580 --> 02:59.280
that stoked the flames
of knowledge, oh.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.620
He stoked more than that, girl.

03:01.686 --> 03:04.153
Yeah, but I never acted on it,
you know.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.553
He was a professor and I was
just a little law student.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.353
But now we're equals
and I'm going for it.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.786
[laughing]

03:09.853 --> 03:11.686
‐ Game freaking on.
‐ Game freaking on!

03:12.653 --> 03:13.853
‐ Whoo! Alright.
‐ Whoo!

03:13.920 --> 03:15.353
Going for it? Going for what?

03:15.420 --> 03:17.220
Khadijah,
goin' for the professor.

03:17.286 --> 03:20.053
Stay with us.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.053
Alright, so what you gonna do?

03:21.120 --> 03:23.186
Jump him behind the podium?

03:23.253 --> 03:25.886
Would you get your mind
out of the gutter?

03:25.953 --> 03:28.586
Please, I'm past needing
a man in my bed.

03:28.653 --> 03:30.853
I need a man in my head.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.186
Someone who can challenge
my mind as well as feed my soul.

03:35.986 --> 03:37.520
Hello, why you think
I'm with Obie?

03:37.586 --> 03:40.020
[laughs]
Yes.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.020
Alright.

03:41.086 --> 03:42.153
[chuckles]

03:42.220 --> 03:44.253
So, I'm off
to a stimulating lecture

03:44.320 --> 03:46.686
on the tax credit incentive.

03:46.753 --> 03:48.486
I'm feeling hot already.

03:51.886 --> 03:53.153
[sighs]

04:05.260 --> 04:07.393
I slept with Clayton.

04:07.460 --> 04:08.726
I knew it!

04:10.093 --> 04:12.293
Start from the top.
Don't miss any details, go.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.826
Okay, look.

04:13.893 --> 04:16.260
After we had lunch that day,
Max had to study.

04:16.326 --> 04:18.493
So I checked out the campus.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.493
I ran into Clayton
and the next thing I knew

04:21.560 --> 04:24.093
we were signing a hotel
register, Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.293
‐ Mm.
‐ Well, Smith seemed too easy.

04:29.193 --> 04:32.226
You have got to tell her or else
this thing's gonna eat at you

04:32.293 --> 04:33.993
and me,
for the rest of our lives.

04:34.059 --> 04:36.726
[scoffs]
I'm takin'
this one to the grave.

04:36.793 --> 04:38.126
I mean, if I tell her now

04:38.193 --> 04:39.993
she's never gonna
trust me again.

04:40.060 --> 04:43.026
Oh, oh, sure she would.

04:43.093 --> 04:44.560
Sure she would.

04:44.626 --> 04:46.693
You were young
and impressionable

04:46.760 --> 04:50.360
and a worldly
older man seduced you

04:50.426 --> 04:51.493
right?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.493
‐ Well‐‐
‐ Oh, my God!

04:54.560 --> 04:55.893
You were on him,
like a, like‐like

04:55.960 --> 04:57.626
salt on a margarita glass?

05:00.093 --> 05:02.766
That man wore tweed
like nobody's business.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.833
Wha‐what are you doing?

05:23.900 --> 05:26.733
This living room
is a common area

05:26.800 --> 05:29.800
not your personal counter
at the funk and fold.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.566
Well, the bathroom is a common
area too but there are at least

05:34.633 --> 05:37.766
three bras
drip drying in the shower.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.633
Those bras moved in here
long before you did.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.433
And for as much room
as they take up

05:42.500 --> 05:44.233
they need to be payin' rent.

05:46.766 --> 05:49.100
I shall take that
as the compliment

05:49.166 --> 05:51.100
I know it was meant to be.

05:53.666 --> 05:56.800
Now, here is the dry‐cleaning
receipt for my bathrobe

05:56.866 --> 05:59.000
and you still owe me
from my bubble bath.

05:59.066 --> 06:00.506
W‐w‐w‐wait a minute. Yo‐you..

06:00.573 --> 06:02.673
You ruined my date
and I foot the bill?

06:02.740 --> 06:04.873
Nah, I don't think so.
Tripp don't play that.

06:06.373 --> 06:09.840
Let me teach you a little
something about respect, Ira.

06:09.906 --> 06:11.473
When you have roommates

06:11.540 --> 06:14.540
you don't leave
your funky drawers..

06:16.873 --> 06:19.106
...laying all over
the living room.

06:22.073 --> 06:25.473
And you don't entertain
in the bathroom.

06:26.673 --> 06:28.206
When I have a gentleman caller

06:28.273 --> 06:30.373
I at least take them up
to my bedroom.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.973
Yeah, kickin' and screamin'.

06:36.406 --> 06:37.473
[sighs]

06:37.540 --> 06:40.306
Oh, looks like someone
was just licked

06:40.373 --> 06:42.006
by the flames of knowledge.

06:44.473 --> 06:48.440
The years have aged Clayton
like a fine cabernet.

06:48.506 --> 06:50.506
And I think it's time
to pop the cork.

06:50.573 --> 06:54.373
Oh, oh, oh, okay now.
Pop that cork, now.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.773
What do you think
of that, Khadijah?

06:55.840 --> 06:58.673
Do you think she should...
pop it?

07:01.446 --> 07:03.480
Well, too bad
he doesn't live in town.

07:03.546 --> 07:06.513
He's probably on that New York
to Philly express as we speak.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.080
He would have been
but I invited him to stay

07:08.146 --> 07:10.746
through the weekend
to my monthly law chat slash

07:10.813 --> 07:14.980
cocktail party
that begins this month.

07:15.046 --> 07:16.080
Hey, now.

07:16.146 --> 07:17.880
Man‐trap party at Max's.

07:17.946 --> 07:19.046
[laughs]

07:19.113 --> 07:20.813
Nah, not this time.
My place is a mess.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.013
I'm having this party
right here.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.213
You can't have the party here.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.746
Why not?

07:26.813 --> 07:30.780
'Cause, uh,
'cause we have a new roommate.

07:30.846 --> 07:32.646
Have to be sensitive to him.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.480
He's not comfortable chatting.

07:37.013 --> 07:38.180
By law.

07:40.113 --> 07:42.046
I know what this is about.

07:47.313 --> 07:49.980
You afraid of losing me.

07:50.046 --> 07:52.380
Oh, yeah, Khadijah, Khadijah,
come here, girl, come here.

07:52.446 --> 07:56.980
You were always, you will
always be my girl. Alright?

07:57.046 --> 07:59.713
Alright now, maybe next weekend,
you, me and Clayton

07:59.780 --> 08:01.486
can get together for lunch.

08:01.553 --> 08:02.820
Just the three of us.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.053
I'd like to suggest
a different dessert this time.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.986
[knock on door]

08:22.420 --> 08:24.953
Do you know what used to be
at the other end of this rope?

08:25.020 --> 08:27.853
Hmm, judging by
the smell of things

08:27.920 --> 08:29.820
I'm guessing a dead horse?

08:29.886 --> 08:31.853
My soap on a rope.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.486
But Miss Regine throws it away
because she said it was

08:34.553 --> 08:36.919
both retro
and disturbingly phallic.

08:36.986 --> 08:38.653
Then she give me
this list of, uh

08:38.720 --> 08:41.120
four soaps that would
meet the diva cell of approval.

08:43.186 --> 08:46.053
Go with Spring Garden, it seems
to have a calming effect on her.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.520
Listen, Tripp, listen to me.

08:50.586 --> 08:52.220
You are the new roommate.

08:52.286 --> 08:55.786
She is just playfully hazing you
like she did me.

08:55.853 --> 08:56.920
It'll be fine.

08:56.986 --> 08:59.653
‐ Do you really believe that?
‐ No, no.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.426
Watch your back, man,
watch your back.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.460
I don't see why you trippin'
on some soap, man.

09:06.526 --> 09:08.926
She threw your woman out
butt naked.

09:10.493 --> 09:12.826
Nah, I was planning on
breakin' up with her anyway.

09:12.893 --> 09:14.693
But my soap is sacred.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.126
I mean, it‐it defines who I am.

09:17.193 --> 09:20.693
Strong, creative, determined.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.026
With a hint of lime.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.093
What do I do about Regine?

09:31.526 --> 09:34.560
Well, you can't trap a badger

09:34.626 --> 09:36.360
by slapping
a bunch of neck bones

09:36.426 --> 09:38.126
out in the middle of the yard.

09:40.093 --> 09:43.260
See, you gotta
hide 'em behind a rock.

09:43.326 --> 09:46.493
Preferably one with some
peat moss, but that's just me.

09:48.093 --> 09:52.193
Next thing you know,
badger stew for everybody.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.126
Yeah.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.400
Max is buggin'. She acts like
I don't have a life.

10:02.466 --> 10:03.633
I mean, I can't drop everything

10:03.700 --> 10:05.166
and help her
with her damn party.

10:05.233 --> 10:06.533
Hey, it's fine, alright.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.600
I don't mind doing all of
the work for her dear friend

10:09.666 --> 10:11.033
Maxine Shaw.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.000
So..

10:19.400 --> 10:20.733
Terrified?

10:21.833 --> 10:23.200
Hell, yeah.

10:23.266 --> 10:24.933
What if Clayton and I
make eye contact

10:25.000 --> 10:26.500
and the magic is still there?

10:26.566 --> 10:28.366
She‐booyi! I'm busted.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.100
Hey, Khadijah.

10:31.166 --> 10:34.566
I've typed up the un‐rehearsed
and un‐solicited compliments.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.833
What?

10:35.900 --> 10:37.266
I'm leaving nothing
to chance tonight.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.300
Every word, every nuance,
every freaking detail

10:40.366 --> 10:44.033
has been carefully choreographed
toward one glorious goal.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.266
To convince Clayton
that Maxine Shaw is the answer

10:46.333 --> 10:49.200
to all of his
dreams and desires.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.933
Okay. Well, alright,
we're having a little play.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.366
Very good, I'd like to discuss
with you my back story

10:57.433 --> 11:00.133
my character, what's my
motivation, how do I move‐‐

11:00.200 --> 11:02.406
To get that line right
without screwing up.

11:02.473 --> 11:03.973
‐ Now come on.
‐ Alright.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.906
"Maxine
is a generous contributor.."

11:05.973 --> 11:08.273
"To a variety of charities."

11:09.773 --> 11:12.640
What? Max, dropping off a bag
of your sweaty bra's

11:12.706 --> 11:14.640
at Goodwill doesn't count.

11:14.706 --> 11:16.640
According to Uncle Sam it does.

11:19.606 --> 11:21.440
No placard, no party.

11:23.740 --> 11:26.540
Alright, Khadijah, your turn,
let's go, sell it, baby.

11:27.873 --> 11:29.840
‐ Max, I can't do this.
‐ What?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.140
You want Synclaire's line?

11:31.206 --> 11:32.206
‐ Here.
‐ No.

11:32.273 --> 11:33.573
No.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.440
I need to get some sleep.

11:35.506 --> 11:37.306
But, uh, it's 7 o'clock!

11:37.373 --> 11:39.006
But I'm tired.

11:40.640 --> 11:44.140
No, you're not. Khadijah,
why are you acting like this?

11:44.206 --> 11:45.840
Alright, fine!

11:47.273 --> 11:48.640
You wanna hear it?

11:48.706 --> 11:51.040
[chuckles]
Fine.

11:51.106 --> 11:54.606
This is about me and Clayton
and that day we had lunch.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.406
‐ Okay.
‐ Break it down.

11:59.506 --> 12:02.113
Well, that day, after lunch..

12:03.480 --> 12:04.746
...I..

12:06.780 --> 12:08.180
...I..

12:09.780 --> 12:11.180
...I..

12:13.913 --> 12:16.146
I noticed I had
toilet paper under my shoe

12:16.213 --> 12:17.346
and I think he saw it too.

12:17.413 --> 12:18.613
Oh, come on, wait a minute.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.846
You've had more embarrassing
moments than that.

12:20.913 --> 12:21.913
Like, that time when you slipped

12:21.980 --> 12:23.080
on the horse patty
at the parade.

12:23.146 --> 12:25.080
Now, come on, let's go.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.746
This lying,
it's a sickness with you.

12:31.246 --> 12:32.313
‐ I tried.
‐ I know.

12:32.380 --> 12:34.080
Come here, come here. Come here.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.380
What's up, girl? Let's party.

12:39.446 --> 12:41.913
Whoo! Heh! Whoo! Hey.

12:41.980 --> 12:44.413
Oh, ew, what,
what is that smell?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.080
You know that might be me.

12:46.146 --> 12:47.980
You know, I did play some ball
and you know, I'd be like

12:48.046 --> 12:50.646
ya, ya, ya, ya, boo ya!

12:50.713 --> 12:52.413
And then,
just for the hell of it

12:52.480 --> 12:54.013
I played a little Frisbee.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.246
‐ And then I..
‐ Whoa!

12:55.313 --> 12:57.080
And I landed
in the dumpster twice.

12:57.146 --> 13:00.886
And I had to dig de‐e‐ep for it.

13:00.953 --> 13:04.453
You know, Overton and Synclaire
must've had catfish last night.

13:05.686 --> 13:06.953
You think?

13:10.986 --> 13:12.086
Ugh!

13:14.020 --> 13:15.653
Alright, now look, Tripp.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.553
Guests are starting to arrive

13:17.620 --> 13:20.186
so you might want to get
with that shower.

13:20.253 --> 13:22.753
I can't. No soap.

13:25.553 --> 13:27.253
Oh, I see.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.986
So, uh, you stank on purpose.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.920
Okay, well you just go ahead on
and be funky, hear.

13:33.986 --> 13:36.120
See if I care.

13:36.186 --> 13:38.120
Oh, but you will.

13:44.186 --> 13:45.120
[doorbell rings]

13:45.186 --> 13:46.120
Alright, he's here, he's here.

13:46.186 --> 13:47.220
That's Clayton, that's Clayton.

13:47.286 --> 13:48.853
Shh! Be cool.

13:49.786 --> 13:51.186
Be cool.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.853
Oh, why, hello,
Professor Simmons.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.426
Oh, Clayton.

14:00.493 --> 14:01.626
[chuckles]

14:01.693 --> 14:04.826
Welcome. Welcome to my law chat.

14:04.893 --> 14:07.226
Thank you, Maxine,
I'm here and ready to chat.

14:07.293 --> 14:09.126
[laughs]
Oh.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.826
Okay, alright.

14:13.893 --> 14:15.360
I'd like to introduce you

14:15.426 --> 14:17.326
to some of my
intriguing friends.

14:17.393 --> 14:18.593
Overton.

14:18.660 --> 14:21.226
Um, oh, my!

14:21.293 --> 14:24.393
Out of pressure
to say something intriguing..

14:24.460 --> 14:28.493
...um, might have to
get back to you, okay.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.293
‐ That‐that's, Synclaire.
‐ Hello, professor.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.626
Maxine, regularly donates her
sweat and bras to charity, no.

14:34.693 --> 14:36.360
She regularly donates
her sportin..

14:36.426 --> 14:38.226
I forgot what I was
supposed to say, I'm sorry.

14:38.293 --> 14:42.060
And you remember, Khadijah.
Uh, get over here, girl.

14:42.126 --> 14:44.360
I'm sorry, I don't
recall meeting you but, uh

14:44.426 --> 14:45.693
it's nice to see you again.

14:46.993 --> 14:50.326
[chuckles]
Oh, good to see you too.

14:50.393 --> 14:51.460
‐ Alright.
‐ Oh, great.

14:51.526 --> 14:53.493
Okay, so,
I might as well introduce to

14:53.560 --> 14:55.293
a few of the lawyers
I beat in court.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.560
Oh, so many to choose from.

14:56.626 --> 14:57.760
[laughs]
Okay.

14:57.826 --> 15:00.200
He doesn't even remember me.
I was trippin'.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.466
He has totally
forgotten you, girl.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.500
Like that sex thing
never happened.

15:03.566 --> 15:06.533
Poof! It's gone, great.
Phew! Whew.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.566
Hey, hold up.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.933
He doesn't remember my goodies?

15:12.533 --> 15:15.266
Oh, no, hells no,
that is not acceptable.

15:15.333 --> 15:16.700
Oh, he will remember me.

15:21.033 --> 15:24.333
So, is this how you interpreted
my insightful parable?

15:24.400 --> 15:26.900
By coming in here and
stinkin' up the whole party?

15:26.966 --> 15:28.933
I don't know man, it's,
it's all good, it's‐it's working

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I mean, you're brilliant.

15:30.066 --> 15:32.133
No, I was trying to help you
bag one badger

15:32.200 --> 15:34.466
not destroy a whole ecosystem.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.466
By the by, did I mention
that I have one of the

15:38.533 --> 15:41.566
top acquittal rates
in the public defenders office.

15:41.633 --> 15:44.533
Oh, yes,
my career is blossoming.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.900
And so am I.

15:45.966 --> 15:47.966
I can see that.

15:48.033 --> 15:49.266
Can you, now?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.200
Absolutely.
You're quite a lawyer.

15:51.266 --> 15:52.800
‐ Oh.
‐ But I'm not surprised.

15:52.866 --> 15:54.400
You took down
the whole administration

15:54.466 --> 15:55.500
in that mock trial.

15:55.566 --> 15:56.633
You were good that day.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.300
[laughing]

15:58.366 --> 16:00.640
And I wasn't?

16:00.706 --> 16:02.940
Gentleman, uh,
shrimp tempura? Huh?

16:03.006 --> 16:04.973
Yes and don't forget to try some
of my fabulous dipping‐‐

16:05.040 --> 16:08.440
Oh, Regine,
let me help you with that there.

16:08.506 --> 16:10.906
I mean, she works so hard.
Alright, yeah.

16:10.973 --> 16:12.640
Would you stop it?

16:12.706 --> 16:13.973
You are ruining business

16:14.040 --> 16:15.906
and you're starting
to sprout fungus!

16:15.973 --> 16:19.673
Starting? I've got a mushroom
growin' in my armpit.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.873
Alright, look, I will replace
your damn soap on a rope

16:22.940 --> 16:26.340
but you will pay me back for my
bubble bath and my dry‐cleaning.

16:26.406 --> 16:27.573
‐ It's a deal.
‐ Fine.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.806
Here you go.
Whoo! I'm glad that's over.

16:30.873 --> 16:33.840
I was starting to feel myself.

16:33.906 --> 16:35.906
These are some great courtroom
action shots of you, Max.

16:35.973 --> 16:37.706
Thank you.

16:37.773 --> 16:38.773
Swaying the jury.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.006
[chuckles]
Oh.

16:40.073 --> 16:41.606
Showing passion
for your defendant.

16:41.673 --> 16:43.273
[chuckles]

16:43.340 --> 16:45.606
Wearing a string bikini
on some beach.

16:45.673 --> 16:47.340
Oh! Ooh!

16:47.406 --> 16:50.040
Uh, now how did that
get in there?

16:50.106 --> 16:52.073
How embarrassing,
oh, look, look.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.906
[laughs]

16:53.973 --> 16:57.406
Oh, oh, excuse me,
one moment, Clayton, I'm sorry.

16:57.473 --> 16:59.140
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

16:59.206 --> 17:00.813
[laughing]

17:02.180 --> 17:04.280
Oh, isn't he beautiful?

17:04.346 --> 17:07.146
Alright. You guys keep
pumping me up to him.

17:07.213 --> 17:09.213
I gotta run across the street
to get that picture of me

17:09.280 --> 17:10.746
and my cousin's
bratty little kid, you know

17:10.813 --> 17:12.813
work the motherhood angle,
alright, alright.

17:19.213 --> 17:20.646
Excuse me, Professor Clayton.

17:20.713 --> 17:21.680
Can I speak to you
in the kitchen

17:21.746 --> 17:23.413
about a little legal matter?

17:23.480 --> 17:26.746
A wise man once said, "There are
no little legal matters.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.280
Just little settlements."

17:28.346 --> 17:29.613
[laughing]

17:32.980 --> 17:37.146
Excuse me, I, um,
here's a little known fact.

17:37.213 --> 17:41.113
The stop light was invented
by Garret A. Morgan.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.446
A black man.

17:43.513 --> 17:44.880
It's intriguing.

17:46.546 --> 17:47.980
That's me.

17:55.213 --> 17:56.980
How could you forget
the Ritz Carlton?

17:57.046 --> 17:58.880
It was the Four Seasons.

17:58.946 --> 18:01.053
And I'll never forget,
Mrs. Horowitz.

18:05.086 --> 18:08.086
Okay. So, why did you
play dumb out there?

18:08.153 --> 18:09.953
Because I didn't know
if you told Max.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.086
And I didn't want
to be the first.

18:11.153 --> 18:13.320
‐ Was I wrong?
‐ No.

18:13.386 --> 18:14.886
(Khadijah)
'I sure as hell couldn't
tell her I had a fling'

18:14.953 --> 18:16.153
'with her college professor.'

18:16.220 --> 18:18.053
"Fling?" Ow, you and you?

18:19.520 --> 18:21.453
I was only gone three minutes.

18:22.686 --> 18:23.786
Oh, Max, hi.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.620
I can't believe
you slept with my mentor.

18:27.886 --> 18:30.253
Former mentor.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.653
No, look, listen

18:31.720 --> 18:34.786
we didn't want to distract you
from your finals.

18:34.853 --> 18:37.186
I mean, who knows,
if we hadn't kept it from you

18:37.253 --> 18:39.753
you might not be a lawyer today.

18:39.820 --> 18:42.453
So, I owe my career
to two sneakin' freaks?

18:44.220 --> 18:45.353
It was only one time.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.820
Yeah, maybe two, three.

18:47.886 --> 18:49.053
Or four, five?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.353
Hours. Times.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.786
Insignificant, nothing really.

18:53.853 --> 18:55.386
Excuse you?

18:55.453 --> 18:56.853
I know what you're doing.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.193
You're playing down your tawdry
little affair with Khadijah.

19:00.260 --> 19:03.593
So that you can advantage of me.
Oh‐ho‐ho.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.226
‐ Maxine..
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

19:05.293 --> 19:07.293
I'm not trying to
take advantage of you.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.360
In fact, I could never date you.

19:11.093 --> 19:13.726
Oh, so..

19:13.793 --> 19:16.026
...Khadijah's okay,
but I'm just squat.

19:17.593 --> 19:20.926
No, no, you're a beautiful,
intelligent, amazing woman.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.593
But you were my student.
I don't date my students.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.026
Former or otherwise.

19:25.093 --> 19:28.626
But I‐I‐re, I really didn't
learn much in your classes.

19:30.226 --> 19:32.893
Come on,
you were one of my best.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.060
And I take pride in thinking
that I may have something

19:35.126 --> 19:37.060
to do with the type of lawyer
you've become.

19:38.926 --> 19:41.226
You're just trying to get back
on my good side.

19:42.826 --> 19:44.093
It could work.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.593
I hope we can still be friends.

19:46.660 --> 19:47.593
Yeah, pff.

19:47.660 --> 19:49.660
But, uh..

19:49.726 --> 19:52.360
...right now, I think
you and Khadijah should talk.

19:52.426 --> 19:54.360
It was good seeing you both.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.726
I wouldn't want to do it
every weekend but...take care.

20:01.766 --> 20:03.466
(Maxine)
'Freeze, Judas.'

20:06.266 --> 20:07.333
Oh, Max, look‐‐

20:07.400 --> 20:09.066
I can't believe
you didn't tell me this.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.666
But then again, you knew that my
college roommate was a lesbian

20:11.733 --> 20:13.900
and you didn't
tell me that either.

20:13.966 --> 20:18.433
Then the guy I chased my entire
sophomore year was Republican.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.200
‐ Jay's a Republican? My God‐‐
‐ Don't change the subject!

20:21.266 --> 20:24.233
Why, why, why

20:24.300 --> 20:26.966
do you keep
such huge secrets from me?

20:27.033 --> 20:29.400
Because you react like this.

20:29.466 --> 20:32.533
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't tell
you, Max, but I felt stupid.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.333
You know, one night stands
are not my style.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.500
[scoffs]
What about Rick from Vegas?

20:37.566 --> 20:39.733
Now, see, that's another reason
why I tell you nothing.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.733
'Cause you're always
throwing it back up my face.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.233
Okay, now look..

20:43.300 --> 20:45.266
If I would have known
you had a thing for Clayton

20:45.333 --> 20:47.833
I would never
have hooked up with him.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.466
Well, you obviously did,
why wouldn't I?

20:54.733 --> 20:55.833
He still got it, doesn't he?

20:55.900 --> 20:56.833
Hello!

20:56.900 --> 20:58.533
[laughs]

20:58.600 --> 21:01.806
Oh, argh, God.

21:01.873 --> 21:03.773
‐ So..
‐ Huh!

21:03.840 --> 21:05.140
You still my girl?

21:07.006 --> 21:10.173
Yeah, I would never let some man
ruin our friendship.

21:11.406 --> 21:13.673
