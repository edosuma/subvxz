00:00.828 --> 00:02.748
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.773 --> 00:06.014
I need to confront my
ex-fiancé, who jilted me

00:06.039 --> 00:08.898
at the altar seconds before
our wedding two weeks ago.

00:08.930 --> 00:10.560
I want everyone to hear

00:10.585 --> 00:12.898
all of the terrible things he did to me

00:12.923 --> 00:15.210
and all the terrible
things he made me do.

00:15.227 --> 00:17.068
She admitted she moved
here just to stalk me.

00:17.093 --> 00:19.229
I'm telling you, Rebecca's crazy.

00:19.231 --> 00:21.832
The only person who sounds
crazy right now is you.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.420
Hey, Paula. It's me, Father Brah.
We have an emergency.

00:24.445 --> 00:26.236
- It's about Rebecca.
- _

00:26.238 --> 00:27.938
Instead of prison, she was sentenced

00:27.940 --> 00:29.389
to a psychiatric hospital.

00:29.414 --> 00:30.507
Oh, my God.

00:30.509 --> 00:32.042
It's like we never really knew her.

00:32.043 --> 00:33.143
Yeah, you're screwed.

00:33.145 --> 00:34.211
I feel things for you.

00:34.213 --> 00:35.712
I got to get the hell out of town.

00:35.714 --> 00:37.714
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

00:37.716 --> 00:38.815
Thank you for saving me.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.317
Rebecca, wait.

00:40.319 --> 00:41.885
Paula called. You cannot leave.

00:41.887 --> 00:43.420
Uh, just, uh, run! Just go around her.

00:43.422 --> 00:44.921
- It's fine. Just go around her.
- What? Okay.

00:44.923 --> 00:46.423
- Giddy-up! Giddy-up, horsey!
- No, I'm serious. Stop.

00:46.425 --> 00:48.258
- All right, she's in my way now.
- You cannot go.

00:48.260 --> 00:51.027
Rebecca, wait. We need
to talk about this.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.900
We know everything that happened.

00:56.902 --> 01:00.170
About Robert, your arrest,
your stay in the hospital.

01:00.172 --> 01:01.271
Hos... ♪ La, la, la ♪

01:01.273 --> 01:02.606
Hospi... ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪

01:02.608 --> 01:04.840
Just... Nathaniel, it's
fine. Just ignore them.

01:04.843 --> 01:06.076
Just-just-just barrel on through.

01:06.078 --> 01:07.859
- Let's go to Roma. Come on.
- Look.

01:07.884 --> 01:09.813
Obviously, there's something
going on between you two.

01:09.815 --> 01:12.616
I mean, you're doing an Officer
and a Gentleman type of thing.

01:12.618 --> 01:13.850
- But now is not the time.
- Okay, it's fine.

01:13.852 --> 01:16.486
Nathaniel, buddy, trust me.

01:16.488 --> 01:18.989
This is a lot more
complicated than it seems.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.991
Okay, Rebecca, I don't
know what's going on.

01:21.016 --> 01:23.460
No. Okay. It's...
What-what happened is they're...

01:23.462 --> 01:24.961
they're-they're being histrionic

01:24.963 --> 01:26.897
because they found out
something about my past,

01:26.899 --> 01:28.298
because, you know, you don't
tell everyone everything

01:28.300 --> 01:30.100
about your past all the
time, and now they...

01:30.102 --> 01:32.135
they all just, like, hate me,
and they're here to yell at me.

01:32.137 --> 01:34.871
No, no, no. Honey, no. No
one is gonna yell at you.

01:34.873 --> 01:35.906
And-and we don't hate you.

01:35.908 --> 01:38.279
I mean, not at all. We... we love you.

01:38.686 --> 01:40.623
And now... now that we know everything,

01:40.647 --> 01:42.280
there's-there's no need to hide.

01:42.281 --> 01:45.148
I mean, we all came because

01:45.150 --> 01:47.384
we want to make sure that you're okay.

01:47.386 --> 01:48.785
And...

01:48.787 --> 01:51.888
Father Brah recommended
a doctor, a good one,

01:51.890 --> 01:54.124
and I... want to take you there.

01:54.126 --> 01:55.525
What do you mean, "a doctor"?

01:55.527 --> 01:57.494
What is it? Is this some
kind of intervention?

01:57.496 --> 01:58.561
What is this?

01:58.563 --> 02:00.563
No, no, it is not.

02:00.565 --> 02:01.898
It is not an intervention.

02:01.900 --> 02:05.936
It's a, it's a convention of loved ones.

02:05.938 --> 02:07.637
No. No, no, it's not,

02:07.639 --> 02:10.707
because-because I know that
Josh gave you those papers.

02:10.709 --> 02:12.342
Yes, well, he's worried about you.

02:12.344 --> 02:13.944
He's not worried about me.

02:13.946 --> 02:16.546
No, he's not worried
about me. I saw you.

02:16.548 --> 02:18.915
Paula, I just saw you with him.
I-I listened to

02:18.917 --> 02:21.418
your messages, and I heard
Father Brah's voice mail.

02:21.420 --> 02:22.719
"Ooh, something's wrong with Rebecca.

02:22.721 --> 02:24.788
Don't tell Rebecca." And
so I went to the office

02:24.790 --> 02:26.623
and I saw you conspiring with Josh.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.925
So...

02:28.927 --> 02:31.294
God, what, are you, like,
best friends with Josh now?

02:31.296 --> 02:33.229
- No. - Is that it? He's,
like, your bestie now?

02:33.231 --> 02:34.998
- He's worried about me? Is that it?
- Honey, no, no, no, no.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.933
No, I see what this is. You
guys aren't here to help me.

02:36.935 --> 02:38.868
You're here to, like, put me away

02:38.870 --> 02:40.670
and get me out of your... lives.

02:40.672 --> 02:42.105
You want me to just
shut up and calm down,

02:42.107 --> 02:44.405
and that I shouldn't think about Josh.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.508
Well, you know what, I'm done.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.310
No, I'm not falling for this
fake intervention-convention.

02:47.312 --> 02:48.645
I know my rights.

02:48.647 --> 02:50.480
You can't put me away
without my consent.

02:50.482 --> 02:51.548
Nathaniel, pick me back up.

02:51.550 --> 02:52.582
Pick me back up. Come on.

02:52.584 --> 02:54.150
- Rebecca, hang on.
- Pick me back up.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.809
Rebecca, I don't really know
what's going on right now.

02:58.924 --> 03:01.091
Wow.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.459
You, too, Nathaniel?

03:02.461 --> 03:04.894
Huh. No, I get it.

03:04.896 --> 03:06.429
You've been, you've
been texting with them

03:06.431 --> 03:07.864
this whole time, haven't you?

03:07.866 --> 03:11.001
You've been texting and
plotting with everyone, right?

03:11.003 --> 03:12.223
You're a traitor, just like them.

03:12.248 --> 03:13.670
You're all traitors,
and that's what the whole

03:13.672 --> 03:15.005
"Run away with me to Rome" was, right?

03:15.007 --> 03:16.506
Okay. Rebecca, Rebecca,
you need to calm down.

03:16.508 --> 03:18.541
- Don't tell me to calm down.
- Rebecca.

03:18.543 --> 03:19.776
We're not trying to hurt you, okay?

03:19.778 --> 03:21.778
What Paula told us is upsetting.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.613
It's upsetting. Upsetting.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.416
Hey, Valencia, you
know what's upsetting?

03:26.418 --> 03:28.418
Um, forcing your dream
wedding on someone else

03:28.420 --> 03:30.998
because no one wants
to actually marry you.

03:32.693 --> 03:34.099
Wow.

03:37.396 --> 03:39.062
Whoa, that's mean.

03:39.064 --> 03:40.964
It's okay, Valencia. She didn't mean it.

03:40.966 --> 03:44.034
She's just projecting her
feelings of insecurity and upset

03:44.036 --> 03:45.702
onto you 'cause she feels trapped.

03:45.704 --> 03:48.641
Oh, words of wisdom from the
community college student.

03:48.666 --> 03:50.073
How unexpected.

03:50.075 --> 03:52.709
Heather, um, you're pathetic.

03:52.711 --> 03:54.911
You know that? Yeah. You're pathetic.

03:54.913 --> 03:57.147
'Cause you were so
desperate to stay in school,

03:57.149 --> 03:58.648
they had to kick you out.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.116
Who does that?

04:00.118 --> 04:01.785
You're just... you're a fraud.

04:02.185 --> 04:03.386
Excuse me.

04:03.388 --> 04:06.289
Would it be inappropriate if I
went to the bathroom right now?

04:06.291 --> 04:08.326
My stomach really hurts.

04:08.351 --> 04:09.559
Darryl, what is wrong with you?

04:09.561 --> 04:11.361
Were you kicked in the head by a horse?

04:11.363 --> 04:14.097
Seriously, it is laughable
that you're my boss.

04:14.099 --> 04:15.565
Oh, God, I wish you hadn't said anything

04:15.567 --> 04:16.933
'cause it's so easy to take you down.

04:16.935 --> 04:17.966
Honey.

04:17.969 --> 04:19.569
Hmm? Honey bunny, Honey Bunches of Oats,

04:19.571 --> 04:23.116
your boyfriend does not
want a baby with you.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.809
Read the tea leaves, 'cause
they're not tea leaves.

04:25.811 --> 04:28.578
It's a big neon sign
that says, "No baby."

04:31.690 --> 04:34.150
Okay, honey, just take a breath.

04:34.152 --> 04:35.318
You're not thinking straight.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.753
Oh, I'm not thinking straight.

04:36.755 --> 04:37.787
Why? 'Cause I'm crazy?

04:37.789 --> 04:39.155
- No.
- 'Cause I'm crazy, Paula?

04:39.157 --> 04:41.535
You know what?

04:42.156 --> 04:44.256
I'm nothing compared to you, Paula.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.729
Yeah, you guys know about
your ringleader here?

04:46.731 --> 04:48.164
How out of her mind she is?

04:48.166 --> 04:49.766
Oh, you haven't told them?

04:50.277 --> 04:53.169
Hmm? Have you told them?
Have you not told them

04:53.171 --> 04:55.371
about the hidden cameras
and the tracking devices,

04:55.373 --> 04:56.940
fake car accident?

04:56.942 --> 04:58.575
Hmm? Yeah?

04:58.577 --> 04:59.609
You know what?

04:59.611 --> 05:02.312
If I'm crazy, you made me crazier,

05:02.681 --> 05:04.214
because you made me do terrible things

05:04.216 --> 05:06.220
because your life is broken and boring.

05:07.650 --> 05:10.220
- Oh, come on, Cookie.
- And don't call me Cookie!

05:10.222 --> 05:11.955
I hate that name. I hate it.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.790
It's like you think I'm
your daughter or something,

05:13.792 --> 05:14.791
but I'm not.

05:14.793 --> 05:16.326
Stop treating me

05:16.328 --> 05:18.661
like I'm your daughter. It is pathetic.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.914
Why don't you go home to
your real family for a change?

05:26.715 --> 05:28.047
So, yeah.

05:33.157 --> 05:34.177
You know.

05:34.179 --> 05:36.946
It's, like, before you
tell me to help myself,

05:36.948 --> 05:38.813
maybe you should, like, help yourselves.

05:40.405 --> 05:42.133
Bunch out!

05:46.291 --> 05:47.924
Hi, Josh. It's me.

05:47.926 --> 05:49.759
You know, Josh, you've
done some crappy things,

05:49.761 --> 05:51.594
but handing over damaging
personal information

05:51.596 --> 05:53.263
to my friends, I mean, that's low.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.898
You know what? You're
scum, Josh. You're scum.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.880
Anyway, call me. It's Rebecca Bunch.

06:00.872 --> 06:02.505
Straight to voice mail again, of course.

06:02.507 --> 06:04.908
Yeah, hi, you know, I
really need to talk to you.

06:04.910 --> 06:06.776
'Cause here's the thing, you
can't treat people like this.

06:06.778 --> 06:08.878
Do you hear me? You can't
treat people like this.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.413
Have you no decency, sir?

06:10.415 --> 06:12.003
Again, it's Rebecca Bunch. Call me.

06:14.175 --> 06:15.552
FaceTime. Hi.

06:15.554 --> 06:17.220
Pick up! Pick up for my face!

06:17.222 --> 06:19.189
Pick up! Pick up! Pick up for my face!

06:19.191 --> 06:21.224
Look at my face, Josh. Look at my face!

06:21.226 --> 06:22.192
Look at my face!

06:22.194 --> 06:23.826
Look at my face! Look at my face!

06:23.828 --> 06:25.828
Wow.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.964
That was... awful.

06:27.966 --> 06:32.902
I mean, I knew she was gonna be
upset, but that was just way worse

06:32.904 --> 06:34.470
than I thought.

06:34.472 --> 06:36.105
I got to go find her.

06:36.107 --> 06:37.640
Wait, Paula.

06:37.642 --> 06:39.609
Look, I've been to a lot of
interventions in my life...

06:39.611 --> 06:40.710
How many times do I

06:40.712 --> 06:43.313
have to tell you it
was not an intervention?

06:43.315 --> 06:44.347
You're right. It wasn't.

06:44.349 --> 06:46.015
It was kind of a
giant, last-minute mess.

06:46.017 --> 06:47.050
No offense. Anyways,

06:47.052 --> 06:48.718
when you do an intervention,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.087
they always tell you, you
don't chase after the person.

06:51.089 --> 06:52.488
They have to want help.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.257
Look, I don't know why
you guys are so worked up.

06:54.259 --> 06:55.522
You ganged up on her.

06:55.547 --> 06:56.993
Of course she's upset.

06:56.995 --> 06:58.828
She'll come back when she cools off.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.029
And how do you know that?

07:00.031 --> 07:02.065
Hmm, I know her pretty well.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.407
Okay?

07:03.935 --> 07:05.165
We did it.

07:05.704 --> 07:06.903
Twice.

07:07.706 --> 07:09.906
One night, but two times that night.

07:09.908 --> 07:11.241
Listen, I'm trying to say

07:11.243 --> 07:13.142
I know her better than
all of you guys, okay?

07:13.144 --> 07:14.344
And yeah, she's zany,

07:14.346 --> 07:16.267
but in a cute way.

07:16.657 --> 07:17.857
Dude, catch up.

07:18.519 --> 07:19.549
You're behind.

07:19.551 --> 07:21.651
Okay, I'm not just
gonna stand here. Okay?

07:21.653 --> 07:23.786
I-I've got to go find her
before she hurts herself.

07:23.788 --> 07:25.154
Or hurts someone else.

07:25.156 --> 07:27.223
I mean, she did try to
burn her ex's house down.

07:27.225 --> 07:28.825
It says so in those papers.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.693
- It says what?
- Hurt someone?

07:30.695 --> 07:31.728
No!

07:31.730 --> 07:33.363
I mean, come on.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.164
She's just going through a rough time.

07:35.166 --> 07:36.466
It's still our Rebecca.

07:36.468 --> 07:38.101
She's a sweet person.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.637
She would never, ever hurt anyone.

07:42.307 --> 07:44.307
Excuse me.

07:44.309 --> 07:45.975
Can I have my hunting knife back?

07:45.977 --> 07:47.844
Yes. Sorry.

07:47.846 --> 07:49.679
I saw it sticking out of your bag.

07:49.681 --> 07:51.581
It's so sharp and scary... I love it.

07:51.583 --> 07:52.982
You know what they say,

07:52.984 --> 07:56.052
no one likes jagged reindeer meat.

07:56.054 --> 07:57.353
Yeah.

07:57.355 --> 07:58.388
Hi.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.899
I am Jarl, from Denmark.

08:00.428 --> 08:04.694
Miss, do you think the famous
people might be staying here?

08:04.696 --> 08:07.063
I want to meet the
stars of Hollywood...

08:07.065 --> 08:08.965
Scarlett Johansson,

08:08.967 --> 08:11.100
Viggo Mortensen,

08:11.102 --> 08:13.386
Erika Christensen.

08:13.411 --> 08:16.239
So you... you came to a
youth hostel in West Covina

08:16.241 --> 08:18.875
just to meet
Danish-American movie stars?

08:18.877 --> 08:19.909
Ja.

08:19.911 --> 08:22.211
Them and Pauly Shore.

08:23.114 --> 08:24.614
That guy.

08:24.616 --> 08:26.649
God, you know, I do love
Erika Christensen though.

08:26.651 --> 08:29.285
- Right? - Oh, my God, she's so
good in the movie Swimfan.

08:29.287 --> 08:31.788
- Ja. - I just recently watched
it, like, eight times.

08:31.790 --> 08:34.256
And I saw the director's cut,
with 20 minutes more swimming.

08:34.259 --> 08:35.857
- What?!
- It's amazing.

08:35.860 --> 08:38.594
And Erika Christensen just
kicks ass in that movie.

08:38.596 --> 08:39.796
Oh, yes.

08:39.798 --> 08:41.264
"His biggest fan just

08:41.265 --> 08:43.966
- became his worst nightmare."
- "Just became his worst nightmare!"

08:43.967 --> 08:45.535
Yes! Yes. Oh, my God.

08:45.537 --> 08:48.671
Erika Christensen is so strong
and brave in that movie. I mean,

08:48.673 --> 08:50.340
I-I know she's technically
the villain and a "murderer."

08:50.342 --> 08:52.809
But, you know what, she
is treated so unfairly.

08:52.811 --> 08:55.011
- Yes. - Like, he-he tells
her that he cares about her

08:55.013 --> 08:57.080
and then casts her
aside, like she's garbage.

08:57.082 --> 08:58.214
I mean, I totally get it.

08:58.216 --> 08:59.816
It's how my ex is treating me right now.

08:59.841 --> 09:03.252
Well, maybe you should
drown him in the deep end.

09:03.254 --> 09:04.821
Oh. Maybe I should, Jarl.

09:06.324 --> 09:08.391
Maybe I should, Jarl.

09:08.393 --> 09:11.160
Jarl, Jarl, that's
exactly what I should do!

09:11.162 --> 09:13.529
Oh, my God! That's what I've been

09:13.531 --> 09:15.429
needing to do this whole time.

09:15.796 --> 09:17.696
Go full Christensen!

09:18.038 --> 09:19.469
God! Oh, my God.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.937
You are so smart, man.

09:20.939 --> 09:22.338
Uh-oh.

09:22.340 --> 09:23.706
Oh, you get me. Yep.

09:23.944 --> 09:26.909
You support me in a
way no one else does.

09:26.911 --> 09:28.711
Oh. Thank you.

09:28.713 --> 09:31.114
- This feels fast.
- The truth is,

09:31.116 --> 09:32.849
I've been wanting to go
after Josh for weeks now,

09:32.851 --> 09:34.517
but it was my friends...
Well, my former friends;

09:34.519 --> 09:36.119
you know, you're my
only real friend, Jarl...

09:36.121 --> 09:38.054
Who were holding me back with their

09:38.056 --> 09:40.156
Common sense and moral compass.

09:40.158 --> 09:42.091
- Ugh. - I mean, that's why I'm off
the grid. That's why I'm here,

09:42.093 --> 09:44.160
so they can't find me. I'm not
answering their calls either.

09:44.162 --> 09:46.854
Ha-ha! Now they're out of the picture,

09:48.089 --> 09:50.433
and Rebecca Bunch is free
to do whatever she wants.

09:50.435 --> 09:54.103
And what I want is for
Josh Chan to feel as hurt

09:54.378 --> 09:57.306
and as powerless and
as vulnerable as I do.

09:57.604 --> 09:59.842
And, Jarl, I will not stop...

09:59.844 --> 10:03.713
until he gets on his
knees, screams at the sky

10:03.715 --> 10:05.548
and wishes he'd never been born.

10:06.103 --> 10:09.051
You have the anger of
a much taller woman.

10:09.053 --> 10:10.337
Oh, I am angry, Jarl.

10:11.089 --> 10:12.868
I'm seven-feet-tall
angry.

10:13.650 --> 10:16.759
And I have every right to be.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.146
Someone at church asked me

11:47.148 --> 11:49.415
about you suddenly coming
back from the seminary,

11:49.417 --> 11:52.516
and I said, "Bridget
Washburn, who are you to judge?

11:52.541 --> 11:54.641
- Your daughter is a whore."
- Lourdes!

11:54.673 --> 11:56.156
It's not hyperbole.

11:56.181 --> 11:57.213
She's an escort.

11:57.215 --> 11:58.448
No shame in it.

11:58.450 --> 11:59.749
She bought a condo

11:59.751 --> 12:01.951
and paid for Bridget's gastric bypass.

12:01.953 --> 12:03.887
Hmm.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.088
Josh, honey,

12:05.090 --> 12:06.322
I feel for you.

12:06.324 --> 12:08.424
Coming home can't be easy.

12:08.426 --> 12:10.226
You have lots of messes to clean up.

12:10.228 --> 12:12.162
I mean, I guess so.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.430
It's a shame. I miss Rebecca.

12:15.183 --> 12:17.933
I made a place in my
heart for another daughter.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.970
Did you two smooth things over?

12:20.972 --> 12:23.683
She was so in love with you.

12:23.708 --> 12:26.453
She must be so disappointed, right?

12:26.478 --> 12:28.578
She's a-a bit disappointed.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.214
- Um, she left a few.. couple messages.
- Oh.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.383
But, um, I think we should, um,

12:33.385 --> 12:35.652
just give each other a
little space right now.

12:36.513 --> 12:39.088
Anyways, I don't really
want to talk about it.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.523
I just want to move on.

12:40.525 --> 12:42.158
That's very wise.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.443
Mm-hmm.

12:43.468 --> 12:45.835
No, I got to start making
some more mature decisions.

12:46.064 --> 12:47.771
Taking myself seriously.

12:48.037 --> 12:49.866
This morning, I called Alex,

12:49.868 --> 12:51.301
asked him for my job back,

12:51.576 --> 12:54.475
he said okay, and when I get there,

12:54.706 --> 12:56.673
I'm gonna ask for that raise I deserve.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.676
Disappear and ask for a raise.

12:59.678 --> 13:02.011
- Seems like a good plan.
- Thanks, Dad.

13:02.441 --> 13:03.980
I want to focus on my future right now.

13:03.982 --> 13:05.949
All the good things ahead of me.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.052
Oh, my God, what was that?

13:09.054 --> 13:10.320
Joseph!

13:10.322 --> 13:12.689
I've been telling you to
get that jacaranda trimmed.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.417
Slapping the window again.

13:15.093 --> 13:17.206
Oh, God, I-I thought that was...

13:18.630 --> 13:21.064
that was like out of a
scary movie or something.

13:26.948 --> 13:29.439
That's right. Laugh it off, Channy Boy.

13:29.441 --> 13:30.707
I'm coming for you.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.475
You know, Rebecca better watch out

13:32.477 --> 13:34.143
how she talks to me,
because I don't even care,

13:34.145 --> 13:36.446
I will take out these hoop
earrings and yank a pony.

13:36.997 --> 13:38.781
Oh, come on, you can't take
what she said personally.

13:38.783 --> 13:39.983
She's not in her right mind.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.218
Which is exactly why I'm here.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.620
She's so lucky she cray.

13:43.645 --> 13:45.955
Oh, come on. I am so frustrated.

13:45.957 --> 13:47.991
I mean, I tried to
track her, but, you know,

13:47.993 --> 13:49.826
she turned off the location
services on her phone,

13:49.828 --> 13:51.861
and she doesn't have her
car that I put the GPS on,

13:51.863 --> 13:54.297
and the tracker I put in her shoulder

13:54.299 --> 13:56.799
- ran out of batteries months ago.
- What?

13:57.357 --> 13:58.801
Oh, it's just a little "boop."

13:58.803 --> 14:00.603
They don't even feel it. You have one.

14:00.605 --> 14:01.938
But don't worry,

14:01.940 --> 14:03.339
- it's dead, too.
- Wait, what?

14:04.537 --> 14:06.009
Oh, my God.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.373
Yeah.

14:08.576 --> 14:09.756
I-I'm sorry.

14:10.170 --> 14:13.228
Look, when we became friends,
I-I meant to tell you.

14:14.735 --> 14:16.753
Before you and Josh broke
up, Rebecca and I were on

14:16.755 --> 14:19.689
a full-on sabotage mission.

14:20.079 --> 14:22.125
I tracked you, I hacked your stuff,

14:22.127 --> 14:23.693
I may have blackmailed

14:23.718 --> 14:25.859
some people in your
life for information,

14:25.884 --> 14:28.031
but I am not proud of it.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.933
- Paula!
- I know, I know.

14:29.935 --> 14:33.102
But I just wanted Rebecca's
love story to... to work out.

14:33.838 --> 14:35.163
I'm sorry.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.573
Do you forgive me?

14:37.575 --> 14:38.608
God, this sucks.

14:38.610 --> 14:41.344
I mean... I thought you
guys were my friends,

14:41.346 --> 14:43.680
and you were manipulating
me the whole time.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.950
We were manipulating
you, but then we were-n't.

14:48.386 --> 14:51.521
Okay, look, I am just
as surprised as you are

14:51.523 --> 14:52.956
that you and I are friends.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.926
I mean, you are literally... the
girl I hated in high school.

14:56.928 --> 14:58.531
But I am your friend now,

14:58.556 --> 15:00.563
and... I love you,

15:00.565 --> 15:02.932
and Rebecca is your
friend and she loves you,

15:02.934 --> 15:05.969
and female friendships are very strange,

15:05.971 --> 15:08.204
and I just... stop complaining.

15:08.206 --> 15:09.539
Because we have to help Rebecca now,

15:09.541 --> 15:12.475
even if you think she
deserves a yank on the pony.

15:13.486 --> 15:15.956
Now let's go.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.885
Hello? Who is this?

15:58.832 --> 16:00.865
How did you get this number?

16:01.116 --> 16:03.745
This is a private line. I
got it on my 13th birth...

17:09.806 --> 17:11.416
Rebecca

17:11.449 --> 17:13.449
Rebecca!

17:13.887 --> 17:16.223
- Rebecca?
- Rebecca

17:16.248 --> 17:18.661
Hey *** Thanks so much
for coming out, you guys.

17:18.685 --> 17:20.590
because this has been a hard night

17:20.637 --> 17:22.928
Yeah, this whole thing totally sounds
like an intervention

17:22.976 --> 17:24.976
I went to five of those for my uncle.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.411
Last one was actually an intervention

17:26.413 --> 17:29.021
because he couldn't stop
watching Intervention on A&E.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.443
I mean, it worked, but then
he moved on to Hoarders.

17:31.466 --> 17:33.966
Now he's got, like,
80 of those on his DVR.

17:33.968 --> 17:36.202
And, you guessed it,
he will not delete them.

17:36.204 --> 17:38.004
They're just piling up.

17:38.376 --> 17:40.573
You know what? Just realized I'm
gonna have to intervene again.

17:40.575 --> 17:41.574
Wow.

17:41.576 --> 17:43.342
I have crazy relatives, but all we do

17:43.344 --> 17:46.235
is talk about them when they
leave, like a normal family.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.414
It was a really tough conversation.

17:48.416 --> 17:51.083
Rebecca was obviously very upset.

17:51.085 --> 17:54.086
She started saying crazy things.

17:54.088 --> 17:56.189
Like, out of the blue, she was like,

17:56.191 --> 17:58.791
"Oh, White Josh does not
want to have a baby with you,"

17:58.793 --> 18:00.960
which is crazy because

18:00.962 --> 18:03.062
well, one: how would she know that?

18:03.064 --> 18:05.860
And two: you said you
would consider it, right?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.633
So she's way off.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.169
You said you would consider it, right?

18:10.171 --> 18:11.771
- Yeah-huh.
- Yep.

18:14.995 --> 18:16.443
Yeah, uh, I think I
see Heather up there.

18:16.468 --> 18:17.777
Might just run up,
see how she's doing.

18:17.779 --> 18:20.079
No, no, no. No, no, no,
Hector, you got to stay.

18:20.081 --> 18:22.048
Ain't no search party
like a Hector search party.

18:22.050 --> 18:23.783
You're great at this. In high school,

18:23.785 --> 18:25.451
you found that girl who
drank all that Sambuca

18:25.453 --> 18:27.119
and passed out in her
neighbor's yard, remember?

18:27.121 --> 18:28.521
Oh, yeah, Susie Reynolds.

18:28.523 --> 18:29.956
You know she's a state senator now?

18:29.958 --> 18:31.224
No way, I thought she was an escort.

18:31.226 --> 18:32.792
No, that's Angie Washburn. Oh, right.

18:32.794 --> 18:35.228
Joshua, if you're not
really considering the baby

18:35.230 --> 18:36.395
and you're just humoring me...

18:36.397 --> 18:38.030
Oh, boy. Darryl...

18:38.032 --> 18:39.860
I'm out. Heather, wait up.

18:41.236 --> 18:42.869
Yeah...

18:44.271 --> 18:45.670
I can't get over this.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.962
I had no idea this was in her past.

18:48.042 --> 18:49.141
It's a big blow.

18:49.143 --> 18:50.643
I guess I'm partly to blame,

18:50.645 --> 18:53.446
'cause I'm the one who told
you to go for it with her.

18:53.448 --> 18:55.258
I got too involved
in your personal life.

18:55.283 --> 18:56.749
I regret it.

18:56.751 --> 18:58.417
Now can we go back to the restaurant?

18:58.419 --> 19:00.686
Because we are waiting for a lava cake.

19:00.688 --> 19:02.855
Yeah, they said it
would take 20 minutes,

19:02.857 --> 19:05.024
and we've been here for 30, so...

19:05.026 --> 19:06.425
You know what? I'm sorry.

19:06.427 --> 19:07.956
I feel terrible.

19:08.329 --> 19:10.763
I interrupted your date,
which you're paying for

19:10.765 --> 19:12.932
with the money I give you every week!

19:12.934 --> 19:13.966
You're right. Let's stay.

19:13.968 --> 19:15.268
I don't even really want lava cake.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.236
I do.

19:17.238 --> 19:18.871
I do, too.

19:23.144 --> 19:25.278
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. Hi.

19:26.074 --> 19:27.280
Glad I saw you.

19:27.282 --> 19:30.983
I had to get away from
White Josh and Darryl. Man...

19:30.985 --> 19:33.019
Ugh. Well, you can walk with me.

19:33.021 --> 19:34.654
I'm not actually looking for Rebecca,

19:34.656 --> 19:36.789
because you can't fix people
who don't want to be helped,

19:36.791 --> 19:37.857
- but...
- Hmm.

19:37.859 --> 19:39.692
... swinging a flashlight around is fun.

19:39.694 --> 19:40.760
So Velma.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.961
I'm totally a Shaggy.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.730
Oh, my God, you totally are, so...

19:47.268 --> 19:50.303
Oh. I'm sorry.

19:50.305 --> 19:51.504
No, I liked it.

19:51.881 --> 19:53.940
Your arms are really
smooth. Do you depilate?

19:54.342 --> 19:55.641
I do not.

19:55.643 --> 19:57.743
Just naturally silky.

19:57.745 --> 19:59.245
Good for surfing.

19:59.247 --> 20:01.581
I do shave the hair around my nipples.

20:01.583 --> 20:02.815
I mean, who doesn't?

20:04.852 --> 20:07.386
Okay, that actually kind
of freaked me out, so...

20:07.388 --> 20:08.910
hold me, Silky Arms.

20:55.197 --> 20:56.896
Rebecca!

20:57.833 --> 20:58.865
Rebecca!

20:58.867 --> 21:01.334
I know this is you! Stop it!

21:01.336 --> 21:02.702
Leave me alone!

21:02.930 --> 21:05.592
I'm not gonna let you
get to me, you hear me?

21:06.780 --> 21:08.679
I'm not afraid of you.

21:16.251 --> 21:17.917
So I'm totally getting to him,

21:17.919 --> 21:20.754
and he's totally afraid
of me... It's great!

21:21.139 --> 21:23.423
Jarl. Hey, hey, hey.

21:23.425 --> 21:25.786
Wake up, Jarlsberg. I'm trying
to tell you something important.

21:25.811 --> 21:27.644
I am tired.

21:27.646 --> 21:30.047
You woke me up in the
middle of the night.

21:30.049 --> 21:32.482
I have to get up early
to go to the Autry Museum

21:32.484 --> 21:34.006
of the American West.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.798
Ew. What? Don't go there.
It's just a bunch of pictures

21:35.823 --> 21:36.989
of Roy Rogers.

21:37.223 --> 21:38.822
You mean Gene Autry?

21:38.824 --> 21:40.457
Who cares? Anyway, Jarl.

21:40.459 --> 21:41.625
You won't believe what's happening.

21:41.627 --> 21:43.393
So I have decided to reenact

21:43.395 --> 21:45.329
every great revenge movie ever made,

21:45.331 --> 21:48.265
and it's... ugh! It is so
good to see Josh squirm.

21:48.267 --> 21:51.356
But what happens after you do
all these scary things to him?

21:51.381 --> 21:52.703
I-I don't know.

21:52.705 --> 21:53.981
I-I feel better, I guess?

21:54.006 --> 21:56.077
No. You die.

21:56.102 --> 21:58.327
Whoa, what?

21:58.383 --> 22:00.750
That's how every one
of these movies ends.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.052
Stabbing, shooting, drowning.

22:03.054 --> 22:04.821
The monster has to be killed.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.024
Once you start this,
skagget I postkassen.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.192
Huh?

22:09.194 --> 22:11.874
You have a beard in your mailbox.

22:11.906 --> 22:13.539
That doesn't clarify anything.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.775
It means you are about to be caught.

22:15.777 --> 22:18.511
And when you are caught, you are killed.

22:21.349 --> 22:22.882
No.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.450
No. That-that's...

22:24.452 --> 22:27.854
No. That's-that's not
how my movie has to end.

22:27.856 --> 22:29.922
No. Uh-uh. No, no. No.

22:30.314 --> 22:33.826
I am independently
financed... in my own mind.

22:33.828 --> 22:36.128
Jarl, don't you see? This
story is not just about

22:36.130 --> 22:37.663
blind evil revenge,

22:37.665 --> 22:39.906
this is, this is about retribution.

22:39.931 --> 22:41.831
And redistribution of misery.

22:41.833 --> 22:44.968
Making Josh feel like
I've felt my whole life.

22:44.970 --> 22:48.071
Wait, you were unhappy
before you met him?

22:48.073 --> 22:50.206
Then how is this his fault?

22:50.208 --> 22:52.375
What? He exploited that unhappiness!

22:52.377 --> 22:54.944
He-he took his normal
and rubbed it in my face.

22:54.946 --> 23:00.250
So what I am hearing is, it's
not really about Josh, per Se.

23:00.252 --> 23:03.786
Josh is more a symbol
of effortless normalcy

23:03.788 --> 23:06.389
from which you always felt excluded.

23:09.461 --> 23:10.627
No, it's about Josh.

23:10.629 --> 23:12.195
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

23:12.197 --> 23:13.963
You're not making any sense.

23:13.965 --> 23:15.431
Although your English
is fantastic, so I mean,

23:15.433 --> 23:17.000
bravo, Danish school system.

23:24.042 --> 23:26.142
So, we crapped out.

23:26.144 --> 23:27.410
We can't find her.

23:27.412 --> 23:29.045
Now what do we do?

23:29.047 --> 23:30.380
Guys, I'm telling you.

23:30.382 --> 23:32.415
She's either gonna
come back or she's not.

23:32.417 --> 23:34.083
We just have to face that.

23:34.085 --> 23:35.552
I mean, she probably just took an Uber

23:35.554 --> 23:36.853
to the outlets or something.

23:36.855 --> 23:39.189
That's where I would go if
I turned on all my friends.

23:39.214 --> 23:42.659
- I'm a real outlet girl.
- I feel so terrible. I mean, I failed

23:42.661 --> 23:44.494
as a best friend and matron of honor.

23:44.789 --> 23:46.849
And a parent, I guess.

23:50.005 --> 23:51.968
Wait, do you guys agree with Rebecca?

23:51.970 --> 23:54.204
Do you think I'm a bad mom?

23:54.206 --> 23:55.538
Uh...

23:55.540 --> 23:58.441
Oh, two-part harmony bad?

23:58.443 --> 24:00.143
- Really?
- Truth?

24:00.145 --> 24:01.945
You're not the most attentive parent.

24:02.592 --> 24:03.947
Brendan's my weed guy.

24:03.949 --> 24:06.701
He's starting a business? That's great!

24:07.385 --> 24:08.985
What? Not the right response?

24:08.987 --> 24:10.253
Hey, can you guys keep it down?

24:10.255 --> 24:12.488
Penny and George are asleep.

24:12.490 --> 24:13.617
They're so beat.

24:13.642 --> 24:15.091
Who? What?

24:15.093 --> 24:16.793
Why are you in my house?

24:16.795 --> 24:19.195
Rebecca could come back
here. I have to wait for her.

24:19.197 --> 24:20.230
I called the police, but apparently

24:20.232 --> 24:21.297
we can't report her missing

24:21.299 --> 24:22.765
for another 36 hours,

24:22.767 --> 24:25.235
because she's just a person
who walked out of her own house.

24:26.404 --> 24:28.171
Anyway, shh.

24:28.173 --> 24:29.802
- Right.
- Okay.

24:29.827 --> 24:31.975
Well, I guess I'll just
keep trying to call her,

24:31.977 --> 24:33.910
and check the tracker,
in case she slips up.

24:33.912 --> 24:36.112
Speaking of which, I am
gonna go see the doctor,

24:36.114 --> 24:37.847
get this tracker out of my shoulder.

24:37.849 --> 24:39.515
- What?
- Suit yourself,

24:39.517 --> 24:41.517
but I just think you
should get a new battery,

24:41.519 --> 24:42.952
'cause if you get human trafficked,

24:42.954 --> 24:44.187
you'll be glad you have it.

24:44.189 --> 24:46.389
Cool, cool. That all sounds terrifying.

24:46.391 --> 24:48.458
Anyways, I'm gonna go
get breakfast with Hector

24:48.460 --> 24:51.594
to distract myself from the
fact that Rebecca was right.

24:51.841 --> 24:55.231
I am an aimless cynic who
has no plans for my future.

24:55.233 --> 24:58.334
Um, and I do have to
do something about that

24:58.336 --> 25:01.371
at some point, in my
life, like, for sure.

25:01.373 --> 25:02.405
But right now, I'm just

25:02.407 --> 25:03.439
gonna go get breakfast burritos

25:03.441 --> 25:05.740
with Hector and his sweet, sweet ass.

25:07.092 --> 25:08.077
Okay, bye.

25:08.079 --> 25:09.802
Okay. Bye.

25:11.967 --> 25:14.417
Thank you so much for
giving me my job back.

25:14.419 --> 25:16.986
You know, while I was
up in priest school...

25:16.988 --> 25:19.022
- Preschool?
- Priest school.

25:19.024 --> 25:21.024
Oh. That makes sense.

25:21.026 --> 25:23.192
So, I've really been
thinking a lot lately,

25:23.194 --> 25:25.862
and... I'm worth a lot more than...

25:25.864 --> 25:27.230
Bro, I got to stop you.

25:27.232 --> 25:28.998
First, I think you're
about to ask for a raise

25:29.000 --> 25:31.234
after I graciously
gave you your job back,

25:31.236 --> 25:33.403
so way to go on the cojones.

25:33.772 --> 25:35.975
But, dude, I've got a problem.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.162
I got an anonymous tip about you.

25:38.410 --> 25:40.376
Aw. I didn't know there was a tip jar

25:40.378 --> 25:42.679
for the back office assistant managers.

25:42.681 --> 25:44.414
People are so thoughtful.

25:44.416 --> 25:47.690
No. Someone called with
some information about you.

25:48.034 --> 25:51.596
You want to explain why I
found all this in your locker?

25:56.667 --> 25:59.062
Alex, come on. I-I didn't do that.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.164
Dude, I don't steal.

26:01.783 --> 26:04.417
Wait, anonymous information tip?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.737
Bro, I-I know who it is.

26:07.739 --> 26:09.238
I-I know who called you.

26:09.565 --> 26:11.974
Rebecca. S-She's coming after me

26:11.976 --> 26:13.376
really hard right now.

26:13.378 --> 26:15.078
She-she planted all
that stuff in there.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.484
Maybe.

26:17.082 --> 26:18.281
I believe you.

26:18.283 --> 26:19.781
I don't know.

26:19.806 --> 26:21.284
I still have to suspend you.

26:21.286 --> 26:23.653
- Wait, what? No...
- Yeah. Sorry.

26:23.655 --> 26:25.221
Corporate is uptight.

26:25.223 --> 26:27.156
They don't like stealing. It's weird.

26:27.158 --> 26:28.421
Sorry, bro.

26:28.793 --> 26:30.765
Pack your flip-flops and go.

26:35.342 --> 26:38.186
Oh, this is where I left my flip-flops.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.850
Well, that's an upside.

26:54.545 --> 26:55.685
Hi, Josh.

26:55.687 --> 26:56.786
Where's your mom?

26:56.788 --> 26:58.154
You might want to check.

26:58.156 --> 26:59.856
Hope Lourdes is okay.

26:59.858 --> 27:01.057
Lourdes, it's so wonderful

27:01.059 --> 27:02.892
that we get to spend some time together.

27:02.894 --> 27:03.960
I know!

27:03.962 --> 27:06.295
- Shall we?
- My pleasure.

27:06.297 --> 27:08.631
I think this will be a day
that you'll never forget.

27:19.356 --> 27:23.253
I used to come here every
year with Josh and the girls.

27:23.278 --> 27:25.612
They grew up and lost
interest in carnivals,

27:25.614 --> 27:27.121
but I still love them.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.979
Oh, me, too. I'm never too
old for a good carnival.

27:31.739 --> 27:33.441
You know, Lourdes,

27:33.708 --> 27:36.894
one of the things I really regret
about everything that's happened

27:37.612 --> 27:39.545
is I'll never get to
be your daughter-in-law.

27:39.547 --> 27:41.127
Oh, I know.

27:41.292 --> 27:44.460
And I did think you would
be a good influence on Joshy.

27:44.462 --> 27:47.034
Oh, I tried, I really did, but...

27:47.674 --> 27:49.998
sometimes you never know
what people are capable of.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.567
- Hmm.
- Hey.

27:52.198 --> 27:55.448
- You want to ride the Death Drop?
- Oh, it's my favorite!

27:55.473 --> 27:58.340
- Completely in the dark.
- Exactly.

27:58.342 --> 28:00.142
Anything can happen on that ride.

28:00.144 --> 28:02.177
- Mm.
- Hmm?

28:04.882 --> 28:06.648
You know what?

28:06.650 --> 28:09.051
Even though most of me is
still worried about Rebecca,

28:09.053 --> 28:10.619
this is fun.

28:10.621 --> 28:13.455
You guys are not too terrible.

28:13.457 --> 28:14.923
I'm glad you're here with us, Paula.

28:14.925 --> 28:17.092
Yeah. Come on. We're a hell
of a lot better than Rebecca.

28:17.094 --> 28:18.627
And she's a psycho. I don't know why

28:18.629 --> 28:20.229
it took you guys so
long to figure that out.

28:20.231 --> 28:22.464
- Good boobs, though.
- Brendan, be respectful.

28:22.466 --> 28:24.366
Sorry. Beautiful breasts.

28:24.368 --> 28:27.202
- Oh, my God.
- Mom, I'm almost a grown man.

28:27.204 --> 28:29.374
No. No, no, no. That's not it. I just...

28:32.001 --> 28:34.201
That looks like...

28:38.826 --> 28:40.389
Like who?

28:42.319 --> 28:43.968
No, I-I just thought I saw

28:43.993 --> 28:46.760
Rebecca with Josh's mom, but
I couldn't have seen that.

28:46.785 --> 28:48.233
That's not possible.

28:50.494 --> 28:53.865
Wow, I guess I... still
have Rebecca on the brain.

28:53.897 --> 28:57.420
Yeah, you must. Hey, since you seem
kind of distracted, can I get a tattoo?

28:57.445 --> 28:58.999
Just a small blueprint
of the local prison.

28:59.024 --> 29:00.202
Yeah, okay.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.500
Where is she?!

29:22.452 --> 29:23.592
Josh.

29:23.648 --> 29:25.414
Dad told me you brought my mom here.

29:25.416 --> 29:26.782
You seem upset, Josh.

29:26.784 --> 29:28.184
What's wrong?

29:28.812 --> 29:30.586
You kidnapped my mother.

29:30.588 --> 29:32.568
What? I did no such thing.

29:32.593 --> 29:34.570
Relax. We're just having a little fun.

29:34.945 --> 29:36.459
She doesn't know who you are.

29:36.812 --> 29:38.594
What you're capable of. I do.

29:38.596 --> 29:40.496
You're completely unhinged.

29:41.593 --> 29:43.499
I've had it with you, you hear me?

29:43.501 --> 29:46.235
This is enough. You
don't mess with my family.

29:46.237 --> 29:48.137
Oh, but it's okay for
you to mess with my life?

29:48.688 --> 29:50.087
Huh? You have still

29:50.089 --> 29:52.781
not apologized or explained
about what happened between us.

29:52.806 --> 29:55.507
I've called you 37 times,
texted you 84 times,

29:55.516 --> 29:57.349
and nothing. You couldn't
even do me the common courtesy

29:57.351 --> 29:58.517
of getting back to me.

29:58.519 --> 30:00.312
So you kidnap my mother?

30:00.588 --> 30:02.927
Do you understand how crazy that is?

30:02.952 --> 30:04.351
You're crazy!

30:04.989 --> 30:07.326
Where's my mother, Rebecca?

30:07.328 --> 30:08.493
Where?!

30:09.930 --> 30:11.330
What are you gonna do, Josh, huh?

30:11.332 --> 30:12.364
Are you gonna kill me?

30:12.366 --> 30:14.032
You gonna push me into this hole

30:14.034 --> 30:15.200
at this janky-ass carnival?

30:15.202 --> 30:16.835
Where is my mother?!

30:16.837 --> 30:17.903
Josh, just relax, okay?

30:17.905 --> 30:19.304
I've had it.

30:19.306 --> 30:21.373
I'm sick and tired of you.
I want you out of my life!

30:21.375 --> 30:22.507
Oh, God.

30:24.111 --> 30:25.811
You die.

30:25.813 --> 30:27.045
Oh!

30:27.047 --> 30:28.313
Whoa!

30:31.997 --> 30:33.897
Damn it, Rebecca!

30:38.258 --> 30:39.925
Lourdes is right there.

30:40.628 --> 30:42.628
She's getting a caramel apple.

30:44.565 --> 30:46.504
I'd never hurt your mother.

30:47.868 --> 30:49.473
God, okay, look.

30:51.129 --> 30:52.938
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

30:52.940 --> 30:54.406
I know I got carried away,

30:54.408 --> 30:56.008
but I was just trying
to get your attention.

30:56.301 --> 30:57.843
I was just trying to
get you to notice me.

30:57.845 --> 30:59.911
So now that... now that we're here,

30:59.913 --> 31:01.346
let's just have a conversation.

31:01.348 --> 31:03.015
Okay? Let's just, let's...

31:03.017 --> 31:04.994
Can we, can we please talk
to each other like humans?

31:05.978 --> 31:08.153
I mean, God, we've been in
each other's lives for so long,

31:08.155 --> 31:10.255
there's so much between us,
you-you can't just throw it away

31:10.257 --> 31:11.361
like it means nothing.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.926
If you ever, ever,

31:14.928 --> 31:17.431
get near me or anyone
I care about ever again,

31:18.766 --> 31:20.439
I'm calling the police.

31:21.335 --> 31:22.534
Josh.

31:22.536 --> 31:24.169
Josh. Hey. No, no.

31:24.171 --> 31:25.303
You can't do this.

31:25.538 --> 31:27.405
Because I-I... I don't know who I am

31:27.430 --> 31:29.061
if you're not in my life anymore.

31:31.297 --> 31:35.099
Leave... me... alone.

32:03.252 --> 32:06.153
Hi. Um, I need you.

32:06.155 --> 32:08.121
I need help. Please.

32:08.123 --> 32:09.820
Oh, honey, it's okay, it's okay.

32:10.070 --> 32:12.092
I need my mom.

32:12.094 --> 32:14.687
Please. Please.

32:15.664 --> 32:17.698
Please.

32:17.700 --> 32:21.101
Rebecca. What? What's wrong?

32:21.757 --> 32:23.603
We shouldn't keep cake in there.

32:23.605 --> 32:26.124
Oh, my God, I must've fallen
asleep while I was studying.

32:26.642 --> 32:29.309
I just had the most scary, vivid dream.

32:29.311 --> 32:31.455
It's Rebecca. She's in
trouble, I just know it.

32:32.929 --> 32:34.635
She's about to hit rock bottom.

32:35.174 --> 32:37.250
I can feel it. I have to do something.

32:45.928 --> 32:47.055
What can I get you?

32:49.398 --> 32:50.586
Um...

32:51.233 --> 32:54.430
Gin and tonic, and, um, extra strong.

32:55.012 --> 32:56.164
Got it.

32:58.007 --> 33:00.289
You know, I had a friend
who used to come here.

33:00.943 --> 33:03.176
He worked at a... a different bar,

33:03.178 --> 33:06.613
but he would do his study drinking here.

33:07.850 --> 33:10.504
Whenever I was out of
options, he was always there.

33:10.809 --> 33:12.329
I remember that guy.

33:12.676 --> 33:15.088
The one that was always
talking about Emory.

33:15.090 --> 33:18.058
Yeah. Yeah, that's where he is.

33:19.561 --> 33:21.332
I'm so lost, man.

33:23.262 --> 33:24.590
It's like, I don't...

33:25.598 --> 33:28.486
I don't know what story
I'm in anymore, you know?

33:33.042 --> 33:34.041
Hmm.

33:35.044 --> 33:37.044
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:37.721 --> 33:39.446
- Look, look, look, look. It's Emory.
- _

33:39.448 --> 33:40.814
It-it's the guy.

33:40.816 --> 33:42.582
He knew that I needed
him! He just, he knew!

33:42.584 --> 33:44.651
On some primal level, deep down...

33:44.653 --> 33:46.920
Greg, hi, hi.

33:46.922 --> 33:48.623
Greg. Greg.

33:49.591 --> 33:51.403
Greg? Greg, I'm here.

33:51.428 --> 33:52.359
Gregory?

33:52.361 --> 33:53.860
Oh, man. Butt dial?

33:54.863 --> 33:57.164
Greg, Greg? Hey.

33:57.166 --> 33:58.965
Hey, Greg, can you hear me?

33:58.967 --> 34:00.634
I really need you
right now. It's Rebecca.

34:00.636 --> 34:01.835
Greg.

34:01.837 --> 34:03.670
I-I hear you ordering
a cheeseburger, Greg!

34:03.672 --> 34:05.172
Greg, pick up!

34:05.174 --> 34:06.269
Greg?

34:06.542 --> 34:08.108
Greg?

34:14.315 --> 34:15.815
He doesn't want me.

34:16.838 --> 34:18.379
Nobody wants me.

34:19.418 --> 34:23.199
I've-I've officially
alienated every person I know.

34:25.594 --> 34:27.309
This can't be the way things end.

34:28.989 --> 34:31.431
All of my time in West
Covina, it can't just end

34:31.433 --> 34:34.333
with me sitting alone
at this crappy bar.

34:34.335 --> 34:35.402
Hey.

34:35.404 --> 34:38.237
I worked my whole
life to own this place.

34:38.239 --> 34:39.699
It's my dream.

34:42.811 --> 34:44.141
Oh, my God.

34:44.166 --> 34:47.297
That's-that's old Greg.
Uh, it's Greg's dad, Marco.

34:49.551 --> 34:52.188
I got, I got... I got
to go say hello to him.

34:57.526 --> 34:58.735
Hi.

35:00.529 --> 35:02.762
- Oh, boy.
- No, don't get up.

35:02.764 --> 35:06.066
Okay? I'm leaving soon. I know
you... hate me. Everyone does.

35:06.644 --> 35:08.235
I... I don't know, I
just wanted to say hello.

35:08.237 --> 35:09.936
Hi. I don't know why.

35:09.938 --> 35:12.973
- Ah. You been boozing, huh?
- No. I'm not really a boozer,

35:12.975 --> 35:15.275
unlike your drunky son
who just butt-dialed me.

35:16.851 --> 35:18.618
So, how, uh...

35:18.714 --> 35:20.247
How is that guy, anyway?

35:20.249 --> 35:21.358
What, you haven't heard?

35:21.383 --> 35:23.350
What? He's drinking again?

35:23.352 --> 35:25.085
He flunked out? He's
bald? He's sad? He's fat?

35:25.087 --> 35:26.219
He's fat and bald and sad?

35:26.221 --> 35:27.621
No, he's sober. And he, uh,

35:27.623 --> 35:29.489
fell madly in love with
a girl in his class.

35:30.959 --> 35:32.692
Um... What?

35:32.694 --> 35:34.060
Yeah.

35:34.288 --> 35:36.596
What's, um, what's her
first and last name,

35:36.598 --> 35:38.532
and just in case it's common,
what's her middle name?

35:38.534 --> 35:40.133
Oh, no, you don't. No, no, no.

35:40.135 --> 35:42.269
For the first time in his
life, he's really doing great.

35:42.271 --> 35:43.970
He's-he's really content.

35:43.972 --> 35:46.106
He's... happy.

35:46.108 --> 35:48.208
... happy.

35:48.210 --> 35:49.409
Cool.

35:49.411 --> 35:50.710
Cool, that's great.

35:50.712 --> 35:53.213
Okay, so everyone just gets
to be happy, except for me.

35:53.215 --> 35:54.514
Got it.

35:54.516 --> 35:55.882
Come on. I'm not worried about you.

35:55.884 --> 35:58.084
You know, you're a smart
broad, you got a nice figure.

35:58.086 --> 35:59.052
You'll be fine.

35:59.768 --> 36:00.792
Really?

36:01.757 --> 36:03.557
'Cause sometimes, I...

36:03.559 --> 36:05.941
Sometimes, I really think
I'm not gonna be fine.

36:06.589 --> 36:07.928
You're gonna bounce right back

36:07.930 --> 36:09.699
from whatever it is
you're going through.

36:10.065 --> 36:11.264
Trust me.

36:11.266 --> 36:12.666
Why are you being nice?

36:12.668 --> 36:16.002
I thought you hated me, and...
thought I was, like, crazy.

36:16.004 --> 36:17.824
Aren't we all?

36:41.627 --> 36:42.986
Hello, Naomi?

36:43.011 --> 36:44.705
It's me, Paula. Don't hang up.

36:45.252 --> 36:48.501
Look, I know you don't like me,
and I don't like you very much,

36:48.503 --> 36:51.338
and we're very different
people, but we both love Rebecca.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.974
And, you know, the thing is,

36:53.976 --> 36:56.843
I've-I've kind of been her
surrogate mother for a while,

36:56.845 --> 36:58.545
but you're her actual mother,

36:58.547 --> 37:01.216
and she... needs you.

37:03.151 --> 37:04.584
She needs help.
