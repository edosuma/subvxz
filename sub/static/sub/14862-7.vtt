00:03.418 --> 00:04.375
Thank you.

00:04.375 --> 00:05.910
Previously on "Mistresses"... 

00:05.910 --> 00:09.080
- We had a moment.
- No, Sam, we did not have a moment.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.449
Someone broke into the
office early this morning.

00:11.449 --> 00:13.017
(Lewis) It doesn't
appear anything was taken.

00:15.687 --> 00:17.088
I'll give you one check for all the money.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.890
What happened to not
having anything available?

00:18.890 --> 00:21.793
I'm selling a piece of the store
back to its original investor.

00:21.793 --> 00:24.329
I'm pregnant, and it's Harry's.

00:24.329 --> 00:25.430
I'll quit my job.

00:25.430 --> 00:27.198
You do what you want to do.

00:27.198 --> 00:28.833
I'm your big sister.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.835
I don't need you to teach
me how to be a good person!

00:30.835 --> 00:32.170
You do.

00:51.143 --> 00:53.312
You really don't have to
get rid of Paul's stuff,

00:53.312 --> 00:55.681
not on my count, at least.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.751
I've been meaning to donate
these things for a while now.

00:58.751 --> 01:02.254
Besides, how else will all of
your shoes fit in my closet?

01:02.254 --> 01:04.557
I have a hard time
separating from my footwear.

01:04.557 --> 01:07.259
They're like sets of twin babies.

01:07.259 --> 01:09.428
No worries. I'll be out
of here in a few days.

01:09.428 --> 01:11.731
You're welcome to stay as long as you want.

01:11.731 --> 01:15.534
And if you want to talk
about anything, I'm here.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.136
Great.

01:17.136 --> 01:18.204
How's Richard?

01:18.204 --> 01:19.572
He's fine.

01:19.572 --> 01:21.407
- Hey, have you guys ever taken an ice cube and... 
- No!

01:21.407 --> 01:23.242
Wh... you don't even
know what I was gonna say!

01:23.242 --> 01:27.146
Let me clarify... if you want to
talk about your fight with Savi,

01:27.146 --> 01:28.280
I'm here.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.482
Oh. That.

01:29.482 --> 01:31.183
Yeah. Yes. That.

01:32.518 --> 01:35.254
Honey, I've known Savi since she was 10.

01:35.254 --> 01:37.790
I know she can be pretty intense sometimes.

01:37.790 --> 01:38.858
Sometimes?

01:38.858 --> 01:41.227
Okay, lots of times.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.496
I've also known you
since you were in diapers.

01:43.496 --> 01:45.731
We're family, Joss,

01:45.731 --> 01:47.333
so if you want to talk
about it, I'm here to listen,

01:47.333 --> 01:49.135
as a neutral party.

01:49.135 --> 01:51.537
Consider me an emotional Switzerland.

01:51.537 --> 01:54.473
Well, danke, but honestly,
everything's fine.

01:54.473 --> 01:56.442
Obviously, everything is not fine.

01:56.442 --> 01:57.877
You moved out of her house.

01:57.877 --> 02:00.412
And I appreciate you
letting me stay here, really.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.882
But you know what? I
gotta jump in the shower.

02:02.882 --> 02:04.383
Don't wanna be late to the mines.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.532
You're kidding, right?

02:19.532 --> 02:21.367
Just hear me out.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.135
Now you know I love the lamb,

02:23.135 --> 02:26.172
but people just aren't
ordering it right now.

02:26.032 --> 02:28.000
It's hot, it's heavy, it's expensive.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.735
And it was in every single
glowing review when we opened.

02:29.735 --> 02:32.004
"Glowing" is what you called them.

02:32.004 --> 02:33.406
I'm not saying we lose it forever,

02:33.406 --> 02:35.408
but maybe we make it a seasonal
thing instead of a staple.

02:35.408 --> 02:38.044
It is a staple. It's one of my best dishes.

02:38.044 --> 02:40.212
What kind of an Australian chef
doesn't have lamb on his menu?

02:40.212 --> 02:42.682
You are the artist. I... 
I'm just the money guy.

02:42.682 --> 02:44.617
Okay? But as the money
guy, I'm telling you,

02:44.617 --> 02:47.253
- if you want to keep the lamb...
- I want to keep the lamb.

02:47.253 --> 02:49.055
Then we have to find the
cash to offset the hit.

02:51.257 --> 02:54.026
Righto.

02:54.026 --> 02:54.727
Where?

02:54.727 --> 02:57.029
Maybe you could talk to Savi.

02:57.029 --> 02:58.397
I'm sure she wouldn't mind

02:58.397 --> 02:59.565
kicking in a little extra capital.

02:59.565 --> 03:01.133
No, I don't think so.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.069
She loves that lamb.

03:03.069 --> 03:04.470
She doesn't eat meat, Jeff.

03:04.470 --> 03:06.505
All right.

03:06.565 --> 03:08.067
She loves you.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.401
I mean, personally,

03:09.401 --> 03:11.337
I would've kicked you to
the curb a long time ago.

03:11.337 --> 03:12.705
I appreciate that.

03:12.705 --> 03:14.440
Come on. Launching a restaurant is hell.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.075
You and I both know it.

03:16.075 --> 03:16.809
Yeah. So?

03:16.809 --> 03:18.644
So... (Chuckles)

03:18.644 --> 03:20.246
so there's not many women
that would go through that,

03:20.246 --> 03:23.082
much less hand over their
life's savings to make it happen.

03:23.082 --> 03:26.085
Yeah, you definitely won
the lottery on that one.

03:29.455 --> 03:31.423
Are you sure you don't need to slow down?

03:31.423 --> 03:33.092
We can stop and rest here.

03:33.092 --> 03:34.760
(Laughs) I'm not that pregnant.

03:34.760 --> 03:35.795
I'm okay, sweetie.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.298
Physically, at least.

03:39.298 --> 03:40.432
Harry?

03:40.432 --> 03:42.067
What else?

03:42.067 --> 03:44.603
Do you think you'll be able to work it out?

03:44.603 --> 03:47.506
Honestly, I'm not holding out much hope.

03:47.506 --> 03:49.074
Did he say something or... 

03:49.074 --> 03:50.776
No, he's barely even spoken to me.

03:50.776 --> 03:52.244
He's been sleeping on the couch.

03:52.244 --> 03:54.647
He hasn't set foot in our room.

03:54.647 --> 03:56.182
I mean, at this point,

03:56.182 --> 03:59.318
I'm kinda just waiting for
him to ask me for a divorce.

03:59.318 --> 04:01.083
I'm so sorry, Savi.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.585
Can we talk about something else, please?

04:03.585 --> 04:04.820
Please. Tell me about your life.

04:04.820 --> 04:06.622
I need a good distraction.

04:09.191 --> 04:11.493
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

04:11.493 --> 04:13.262
- You winced.
- I didn't.

04:13.262 --> 04:16.231
Like someone was coming at you with a 2x4.

04:16.231 --> 04:17.798
Okay. Okay.

04:17.798 --> 04:22.070
I just don't know how everything
became such a disaster.

04:22.070 --> 04:25.173
One minute, it's Elizabeth,
the next, it's Sam.

04:25.173 --> 04:27.242
Wait. Sam?

04:27.242 --> 04:28.877
Seriously? I thought
you were done with him.

04:28.877 --> 04:32.514
I am. I just don't know
that he's done with me.

04:32.514 --> 04:34.549
What does that mean?

04:34.549 --> 04:38.549
He came to my office again the other day.

04:40.255 --> 04:41.957
He's confused.

04:41.957 --> 04:44.259
It's a schoolboy crush
he's taking a step too far.

04:44.259 --> 04:47.729
Too far? Y... you're not
feeling threatened, are you?

04:47.729 --> 04:49.164
No. Of course not.

04:50.232 --> 04:52.801
He's hurt, rejected, and immature,

04:52.801 --> 04:54.569
but certainly not dangerous.

04:54.569 --> 04:56.271
Okay.

04:56.271 --> 04:57.205
Ugh.

04:57.205 --> 04:58.840
You're the professional.

05:00.142 --> 05:02.244
Jus... if anything happens
or you start to feel unsafe,

05:02.244 --> 05:04.479
promise me you're gonna call me.

05:04.479 --> 05:06.615
I promise.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.621
(Elevator bell dings)

05:12.621 --> 05:16.091
Excuse me. Will you hold the door, please?

05:16.091 --> 05:17.626
Thank you.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.028
Thank you.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.097
Oh. Yeah.

05:27.269 --> 05:29.671
Ah. Namah shivaya.

05:29.671 --> 05:31.106
Oh.

05:31.106 --> 05:32.841
Do you practice?

05:32.841 --> 05:34.976
Do I look like somebody who practices yoga?

05:34.976 --> 05:36.945
(Laughs) Well, you never know.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.081
That is the beauty of yoga.

05:39.081 --> 05:41.950
I'm sorry to say, uh, I wouldn't know.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.086
Well, you know about the mala beads.

05:44.086 --> 05:46.221
I spent six months in India,

05:46.221 --> 05:49.191
though only for work, unfortunately.

05:49.191 --> 05:50.926
Oh, gosh. I'm so jealous.

05:50.926 --> 05:53.195
I've been dying to go to India.

05:53.195 --> 05:54.496
You would love it.

05:54.496 --> 05:57.265
- Mm, I bet.
- (Elevator bell dings)

05:57.265 --> 05:58.700
Ah. After you.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.068
Thank you.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.106
Alex, what are you doing here?

06:04.106 --> 06:05.941
It was a pleasure to meet you.

06:05.941 --> 06:07.776
Oh, yeah.

06:09.177 --> 06:12.013
I, uh, I had a private lesson
down the street, and, uh,

06:12.013 --> 06:14.149
I thought you could
use a little pick-me-up.

06:14.149 --> 06:16.084
What was that?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.486
What was what?

06:17.486 --> 06:19.187
(Imitates French accent) It was a pleasure.

06:19.187 --> 06:22.624
Oh. We rode up together in the elevator.

06:22.624 --> 06:24.159
(Normal voice) Do you know who that was?

06:24.159 --> 06:26.628
No. Is he famous?

06:26.628 --> 06:28.163
Gosh darn it, I always miss famous people.

06:28.163 --> 06:30.232
I was at a Starbucks with Sally once

06:30.232 --> 06:32.167
and I guess we were behind
Neil Patrick Harris... 

06:32.167 --> 06:34.136
No. That was Olivier.

06:34.136 --> 06:35.237
Le douche.

06:35.237 --> 06:37.072
- Oh, that's your boss?
- Yeah.

06:37.072 --> 06:38.240
Oh, he's so nice.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.076
Oh, well, clearly, you're insane.

06:42.711 --> 06:44.045
Ah.

06:44.045 --> 06:45.247
Wow. Are you okay?

06:45.247 --> 06:46.715
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

06:53.221 --> 06:55.891
We need to talk.

06:57.859 --> 07:01.129
Just say it, okay? Please.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.165
Just get it over with.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.241
I think you should keep your job.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.278
What?

07:16.278 --> 07:19.648
You're so close to making partner, Sav.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.082
Doesn't make any sense

07:21.082 --> 07:22.984
to take so many steps back at another firm.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.986
You worked so hard to get where you are,

07:24.986 --> 07:29.157
and I know how important
it is to you, so... 

07:29.157 --> 07:30.525
We'll figure it out.

07:30.525 --> 07:31.927
"We"?

07:33.094 --> 07:35.997
You said "we."

07:35.997 --> 07:37.833
What?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.501
"We'll figure it out."

07:42.137 --> 07:44.773
Does that... 

07:44.773 --> 07:47.075
does that mean there's still a we?

07:50.011 --> 07:51.780
Yeah.

09:03.015 --> 09:05.117
Well, that's officially above my pay grade.

09:05.117 --> 09:06.652

she slashed my tires.

19:18.326 --> 19:20.194
What?

I'm kidding. She told
me to have a good time.

Madi knows that I've dated,

19:44.085 --> 19:48.085

her to anyone before.

19:49.123 --> 19:51.058

tomorrow for a couple days.

Why don't you sleep on
it, and we can revisit this

19:57.064 --> 19:59.100
- when I get back?

20:14.148 --> 20:16.083
Well, what I need right now is a drink.

20:16.083 --> 20:19.053
- Uh-oh. Why?
- Why not? Come on. I'm buying.

20:19.053 --> 20:22.123
I can't. The studio asked me
to cover a class last minute.

20:22.123 --> 20:23.691
Well, tell them you made plans.

20:23.691 --> 20:25.693
- I already said yes.
- Alex, come on. Tell them you're sick.

20:25.693 --> 20:27.928
Say it's a stomach thing.
Nobody ever asks for details

20:27.928 --> 20:30.264
- when it's a stomach thing.
- Actually, now that I'm paying rent,

20:30.264 --> 20:31.966
I could really use the money.

20:31.966 --> 20:33.234

asking me that. I'm fine.

20:46.681 --> 20:49.517

No. No. No. No. I... I'm... I'm sorry.

31:38.533 --> 31:41.903
It's just... 

31:41.903 --> 31:44.172
I've made this mistake before.

31:44.172 --> 31:46.908
What mistake is that?

31:46.908 --> 31:49.111
It's not clean between us.

31:49.111 --> 31:50.979
The investigation is still open.

31:52.080 --> 31:56.051
And I need to do the right thing here,

31:56.051 --> 31:59.187
and the right thing is for you to go.

31:59.187 --> 32:02.491
Mm.

32:02.491 --> 32:04.192
Yeah. No.

32:04.192 --> 32:08.163
Well, thanks for the
wine. I'll find my way out.

32:16.071 --> 32:19.541
Harry. Hey, it's me, again.

32:19.541 --> 32:22.444
I have no idea where you are,
and I'm starting to get worried.

32:22.444 --> 32:24.112
So if you could just
let me know you're okay,

32:24.112 --> 32:27.115
that would be great.

32:27.115 --> 32:29.217
(Sighs)

32:29.217 --> 32:31.286
Harry?

32:31.286 --> 32:32.921
Are you home?

32:35.891 --> 32:37.492
Damn it, Harry.

32:46.968 --> 32:49.104
I took a cab. Don't worry.

32:49.154 --> 32:52.591
Alex, what I did tonight
was totally not cool.

32:55.227 --> 32:58.063
I don't even know what it was.

32:58.063 --> 33:01.099
Yeah, well, I can do some pretty
stupid things when I'm drunk.

33:01.099 --> 33:04.436
I've never seen you like this.

33:04.436 --> 33:07.038
You know, and it's not just tonight either.

33:07.038 --> 33:09.408
You've been acting weird
the last couple of days.

33:09.408 --> 33:12.010
You don't know me that well, Alex.

33:12.010 --> 33:13.612
I don't think that's true.

33:13.612 --> 33:16.114
It is. You've really
only seen the good parts.

33:16.114 --> 33:17.983
Are you gonna tell me that you have

33:17.983 --> 33:19.951
some evil alter ego or something?

33:19.951 --> 33:21.353
Yes.

33:21.353 --> 33:23.321
I kick puppies and steal
from children and... 

33:23.321 --> 33:25.290
Joss.

33:25.290 --> 33:27.359
I need you to tell me what's going on.

33:27.359 --> 33:30.095
Fine.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.564
I had a huge fight with
my sister the other day.

33:34.199 --> 33:36.635
- Huh.
- What?

33:36.635 --> 33:38.003
I thought it was weird that
you hadn't been calling her.

33:38.003 --> 33:39.971
You usually talk, like, every five minutes.

33:39.971 --> 33:43.675
Yeah, well, we haven't talked
in, like, two full days,

33:43.675 --> 33:45.944
which is pretty much the
longest we've ever gone.

33:45.944 --> 33:48.079
Well, how is that even possible.
You guys live in the same house.

33:48.079 --> 33:49.347
(Clicks)

33:49.347 --> 33:52.150
And that's the other thing. I moved out.

33:52.150 --> 33:54.453
You moved out?

33:54.453 --> 33:58.123
Oh, wow. Gosh. What kind of fight was this?

33:58.123 --> 33:59.691
I'll spare you the gory details,

33:59.691 --> 34:01.393
but let's just say it was pretty dark.

34:01.393 --> 34:03.028
Why didn't you just tell me?

34:03.028 --> 34:05.464
I don't want to be a drag.

34:05.464 --> 34:06.965
You're my friend.

34:06.965 --> 34:09.434
That's what friends do.

34:09.434 --> 34:13.434
You were there for me,
and I'm here for you.

34:13.638 --> 34:16.041
Oh. Thanks.

34:16.041 --> 34:17.576
(Chuckles) I mean it.

34:17.576 --> 34:19.911
Alex, thank you.

34:21.346 --> 34:23.447
Is there anything I can do to help?

34:23.447 --> 34:25.650
Ugh. No.

34:25.650 --> 34:26.918
I don't even know what I'm supposed to do.

34:26.918 --> 34:29.387
I don't really have a plan yet. Like... 

34:31.056 --> 34:33.058
but I do have a raging headache.

34:33.058 --> 34:35.060
Could I please, please get an aspirin?

34:35.060 --> 34:37.996
You can even have a glass of water.

Thank you.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.282
Mm, you might want to taste
it before you thank me.

36:50.282 --> 36:53.118
I mean about last night.

36:53.118 --> 36:54.186
I needed that.

36:54.186 --> 36:56.421
Oh. Don't mention it.

But I'll let you know if that changes.

37:04.296 --> 37:05.664
I'm talking about Savi.

37:05.664 --> 37:07.599
Do we have to?

37:07.599 --> 37:10.168
I'm just afraid that you
might be cutting off your nose

37:10.168 --> 37:11.503
to spite your face by shutting her out.

37:11.503 --> 37:12.771
I'm not shutting her out.

37:12.771 --> 37:15.273
I know she called you.

37:15.273 --> 37:17.309
It's not enough, April.

37:17.309 --> 37:19.144
Do you know how stupid I feel?

37:19.144 --> 37:20.412
My whole life, I always
thought that Savi and I

37:20.412 --> 37:23.114
- were closer than anything.
- Well, you are close.

37:23.114 --> 37:25.817
She didn't tell me about Dom or the baby.

37:25.817 --> 37:27.519
She told Karen and she told you.

37:27.519 --> 37:30.322
Look, I know you mean well,

37:30.322 --> 37:33.091
and I feel really horrible
putting you in this position.

37:33.091 --> 37:34.593
Maybe it's not a good
idea that I crashed here.

37:34.593 --> 37:36.494
I'm happy to have you.

37:36.494 --> 37:39.831
Yeah? 'Cause I'm pretty
sure I just gave Lucy coffee.

- Mm. (Crunches)
- (Dog barks in distance)

37:46.404 --> 37:48.573
Alex said I could crash with
her until I find a place.

37:48.573 --> 37:51.743
- Isn't that kind of weird?
- What?

37:51.743 --> 37:54.145
Moving in with someone
you're sleeping with?

37:54.145 --> 37:56.281
Slept with. Once. And I'm not moving in.

37:56.281 --> 37:58.250
She's my friend, April.

37:58.250 --> 38:00.518
- I'm your friend.
- (Spoon clinks)

38:00.518 --> 38:02.287
I know.

38:02.287 --> 38:05.323
And I promise you that
everything's gonna be okay.

38:13.265 --> 38:16.501
What happened to all the cookies?

38:16.501 --> 38:19.804
(Cell phone alert chimes)

38:32.817 --> 38:35.287
I'm not even gonna ask you where you were.

38:37.656 --> 38:40.158
Just needed some air.

38:40.158 --> 38:42.227
12 and a half hours is a lot of air.

38:43.328 --> 38:46.131
So you're angry at me.

38:46.131 --> 38:49.701
Harry, I am willing to do

38:49.701 --> 38:53.138
whatever it takes,

38:53.138 --> 38:56.174
whatever it takes to
help you move past this.

38:56.174 --> 38:58.176
But when you tell me what that is,

38:58.176 --> 39:00.211
I have to be able to
take you at face value,

39:00.211 --> 39:03.615
or I don't know how to be in this with you.

39:03.615 --> 39:05.850
So what exactly do you want from me?

39:07.252 --> 39:11.556
I just want to know where
you are with this, for real.

39:11.556 --> 39:14.859
I mean, you say that you're okay, but... 

39:14.859 --> 39:17.195
you're clearly not okay.

39:17.195 --> 39:19.564
Well, yeah. I mean, I don't
know where I am. Is that wrong?

39:19.564 --> 39:23.564
I am all over the place, really.

39:23.868 --> 39:26.871
I didn't plan last night. I had
no intention of hitting anyone,

39:26.871 --> 39:29.674
but there he was.

39:30.809 --> 39:32.477
It just happened.

39:34.179 --> 39:37.515
You know, and to be
completely honest, it... 

39:37.515 --> 39:39.551
it felt pretty good.

39:39.551 --> 39:43.154
Now I feel a bit better.

39:43.154 --> 39:46.791
For the first time since you told me, I... 

39:46.791 --> 39:48.493
I felt better.

39:48.493 --> 39:50.428
You do?

39:50.428 --> 39:51.563
Really?

39:51.563 --> 39:53.231
Yeah.

39:58.203 --> 39:59.738
Okay then.

40:04.509 --> 40:05.844
That's good.

40:09.180 --> 40:11.182
Good.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.289
(Cell phone rings)

40:20.592 --> 40:21.726
Hey.

40:21.726 --> 40:24.095
Hey. Ready for Pittsburgh?

40:24.095 --> 40:26.398
Well, I'm heading to
the airport in an hour,

40:26.398 --> 40:28.099
but I'm heading to the drugstore right now

40:28.099 --> 40:29.667
because Madi can't seem to remember

40:29.667 --> 40:31.870
how my toothbrush ended up in the toilet.

40:32.020 --> 40:34.255
(Chuckles) Nice.

40:34.255 --> 40:36.324
So listen, I've been thinking

40:36.324 --> 40:39.661
about this whole Santa Barbara thing,

40:39.661 --> 40:41.296
and I'm in.

40:41.296 --> 40:42.530
(Keys jangle) Uh... 

40:42.530 --> 40:43.598
- Really?
- Really.

40:43.598 --> 40:44.832
I'm in... the weekend,

40:44.832 --> 40:47.535
telling the girls, all of it.

40:47.535 --> 40:49.003
April... 

40:49.003 --> 40:50.638
this is great. I... 

40:50.638 --> 40:52.006
I think I just dropped
my keys in the gutter,

40:52.006 --> 40:54.542
but I don't even care, 'cause
that's how great this is.

40:54.542 --> 40:55.643
Have a great flight, okay?

40:55.643 --> 40:58.279
And call me the second you get back.

40:58.279 --> 41:00.281
I will.

41:14.963 --> 41:16.931
(Dog barking in distance)

41:26.274 --> 41:28.409
(Horn honks)

41:30.678 --> 41:33.314
Luce, carpool. Are you ready?

41:34.949 --> 41:36.284
What's wrong?

41:36.284 --> 41:38.920
I don't feel that good.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.256
Hmm. No fever.

41:41.256 --> 41:42.657
This couldn't have anything to do

41:42.657 --> 41:45.793
with that empty package
of cookies, could it?

41:45.793 --> 41:47.962
Actually, I think I feel a little better.

41:47.962 --> 41:49.897
I'm glad to hear it. 

41:49.897 --> 41:52.834
Love you, baby. Have a good day at school.

41:59.574 --> 42:02.243
(Knock on door)

42:02.243 --> 42:04.646
What did you forget now?

42:10.830 --> 42:12.866
Hi, April.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.782
