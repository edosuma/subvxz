00:01.581 --> 00:03.769
All right. Good one. Next, next. Okay.

00:03.789 --> 00:05.985
Yeah, good.

00:06.004 --> 00:06.953
Bam.

00:07.038 --> 00:09.416
Hey, guys, just reminding you
about the meet this weekend.

00:09.435 --> 00:11.842
Get there early.
Warm-ups start at 7:30.

00:11.862 --> 00:13.417
You got it. Don't be late.

00:13.438 --> 00:15.726
Maya's one of our strongest gymnasts.

00:15.746 --> 00:18.132
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.968
I can't wait to see her
win her first medal.

00:22.804 --> 00:24.722
You hear that?

00:24.742 --> 00:26.890
We're gonna win a medal.

00:26.911 --> 00:29.375
Technically, it would be Maya's medal.

00:29.394 --> 00:30.850
No, no. That's our medal.

00:30.870 --> 00:32.600
All the money we spend on classes,

00:32.621 --> 00:34.289
talking to the other parents.

00:34.308 --> 00:36.427
Yeah, that is the worst.

00:36.448 --> 00:38.985
I don't care about your
husband's sleep apnea.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.987
I don't care if your cat has diabetes.

00:41.472 --> 00:43.590
You're right.
We do deserve that medal.

00:51.401 --> 00:54.284
What are the squiggle marks
here on Farmer Todd's hands?

00:54.371 --> 00:56.451
Oh, I wanted to make it
look like he had the shakes.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.206
- Oh.
- I could also add some stink lines.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.573
- No, no, no.
- Unless you think it's too much.

00:59.658 --> 01:01.685
- No, no. I like the, I like the shakes.
- Okay.

01:01.704 --> 01:03.411
- The more alcoholic, the better, okay?
- That one.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.412
Hey!

01:04.763 --> 01:06.487
I've got great news.

01:06.507 --> 01:08.415
You're transitioning into a woman.

01:09.801 --> 01:11.259
Farmer Todd

01:11.278 --> 01:14.221
has a... publisher.

01:14.257 --> 01:15.305
- Really?
- Na-uh.

01:15.391 --> 01:16.390
- Yes.
- Really?

01:16.426 --> 01:18.259
What's the publishing house?

01:18.278 --> 01:20.920
Is there an advance? We should go in
on a race horse together.

01:20.941 --> 01:21.864
Stop.

01:21.885 --> 01:23.564
- Is it official?
- Basically.

01:23.599 --> 01:25.947
We just need to sit down
with Shep's publisher friend,

01:25.966 --> 01:29.075
then we need to pitch her idea,
then she needs to like it.

01:29.094 --> 01:30.799
Oh, okay, so we don't have a publisher.

01:30.819 --> 01:34.000
We will. We just need
to sit down with her this weekend.

01:34.020 --> 01:36.072
Well... I can't.

01:36.091 --> 01:37.933
We have Maya's gymnastics meet.

01:37.954 --> 01:39.112
Reschedule it.

01:39.198 --> 01:42.036
No way. Lina and I might win a medal.

01:45.634 --> 01:47.203
There's a lot of gymnasts.

01:47.222 --> 01:49.908
- Mommy, I have to pee again.
- Ah! Again?

01:49.927 --> 01:51.209
I have a small bladder.

01:51.293 --> 01:53.460
- I'm a child.
- Okay, baby.

01:53.545 --> 01:56.180
Up there, to the left.
Will you go with them?

01:57.507 --> 01:59.533
She's anxious.
She has to pee when she's anxious.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.588
It's her tell.

02:00.608 --> 02:03.480
She better get her shit together
and not blow this for us.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.846
Russ?

02:05.355 --> 02:06.658
Kristi.

02:09.090 --> 02:10.086
Hey.

02:10.106 --> 02:12.316
- Mm, wow.
- Wow, yeah.

02:16.625 --> 02:17.915
I am sorry, uh...

02:17.936 --> 02:20.894
Kristi, uh...
this is, uh... my wife.

02:21.018 --> 02:22.569
- Lina.
- Lina.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.993
Yes, I figured. Yeah.

02:25.403 --> 02:28.175
Are you guys here for the gymnastics meet?

02:28.195 --> 02:29.163
Our daughter's in the Blues.

02:29.248 --> 02:31.526
- Do you have a kid competing?
- Uh, no.

02:31.545 --> 02:34.480
Actually, I'm one of the judges.

02:34.984 --> 02:35.502
Anyways,

02:35.587 --> 02:38.234
it was really nice to finally meet you.

02:38.253 --> 02:39.507
Uh-huh.

02:43.002 --> 02:44.430
Who was that?

02:44.554 --> 02:46.430
We're not gonna win a medal.

02:49.057 --> 02:51.165
Here, here. Room 305.

02:54.293 --> 02:56.800
So why aren't we winning a medal?

02:57.420 --> 03:00.552
You remember that time that
we broke up after college?

03:00.776 --> 03:03.031
Oh, when I was "crowding" you?

03:03.050 --> 03:05.149
It was a confusing time.

03:05.169 --> 03:06.366
- Uh-huh.
- Anyway,

03:06.419 --> 03:09.450
Kristi was one of the people
that I hooked up with.

03:09.662 --> 03:10.820
Okay.

03:11.056 --> 03:14.332
And she was... really into me.

03:15.115 --> 03:16.801
And...

03:17.150 --> 03:19.288
No, I mean, like, she was really into me.

03:19.308 --> 03:20.980
We had incredible sex.

03:21.033 --> 03:22.949
I mean, crazy sex.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.117
I mean, she was a gymnast, you know, so...

03:24.152 --> 03:25.457
Is there a point to this?

03:25.478 --> 03:26.954
There's no way

03:26.989 --> 03:29.907
that that woman can judge us fairly.

03:32.192 --> 03:35.795
Oh... because of how hard you banged her.

03:36.125 --> 03:38.799
Because I went back to you.

03:39.203 --> 03:40.560
- Ah.
- You won.

03:40.579 --> 03:42.135
What did I win?

03:42.602 --> 03:43.971
This is not funny, Lina.

03:44.972 --> 03:46.800
I ruined that woman. Mm-hmm.

03:46.820 --> 03:51.491
And now she is gonna ruin Maya's
chances at winning a medal.

03:51.512 --> 03:53.209
You really believe that?

03:53.346 --> 03:56.015
I just feel... really bad for Maya.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.329
Yeah.

03:57.348 --> 04:00.104
It sucks to have a delusional father.

04:05.944 --> 04:07.995
Okay, so this is for children?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.669
It's for the whole family.

04:09.689 --> 04:12.032
How hard is it to have
that first conversation

04:12.084 --> 04:15.034
with your children about
the disease of addiction?

04:15.086 --> 04:17.230
Well, now it doesn't have to be.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.005
And then the-the animals,

04:19.040 --> 04:21.841
they throw an intervention for this farmer?

04:21.877 --> 04:23.521
All except the horse... he's an enabler.

04:23.523 --> 04:25.435
You know, if this works out,

04:25.456 --> 04:27.714
I have an erotic science fiction trilogy

04:27.800 --> 04:28.932
that I've been working on

04:29.018 --> 04:30.548
for some time.

04:30.569 --> 04:31.935
So, here's my offer.

04:31.956 --> 04:34.156
You have till midnight tonight

04:34.177 --> 04:37.060
to decide how else we take
this across the street.

04:37.081 --> 04:38.459
Across the street.

04:39.129 --> 04:40.630
"Across the street"?

04:40.651 --> 04:42.112
To Panera?

04:42.853 --> 04:44.113
I think what AJ is trying to say

04:44.199 --> 04:45.983
is that he's very excited,

04:46.067 --> 04:48.290
uh, for you to share this with your team

04:48.310 --> 04:51.988
and to see what they think.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.273
- Right.
- Okay.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.159
Great. Well, thank you.

04:56.627 --> 04:57.827
Wonderful.

04:57.913 --> 04:59.432
- All right.
- Well... All right.

04:59.451 --> 05:01.831
Shep, can I talk to you alone for a second?

05:01.851 --> 05:03.584
- Uh, sure.
- Great.

05:08.406 --> 05:11.007
So what did she say?
She want the movie rights, too?

05:11.028 --> 05:12.893
Hold it... live action or CGI?

05:12.927 --> 05:16.646
She just asked me to dinner tonight.

05:17.252 --> 05:17.930
Ah... really?

05:18.016 --> 05:19.213
- Yeah.
- To talk about the book?

05:19.233 --> 05:21.975
I don't think so.
It was like an actual date.

05:21.995 --> 05:24.855
Oh, great, Shep. Yes!
That is awesome, buddy!

05:24.939 --> 05:25.723
Is it? We're in!

05:25.744 --> 05:27.062
Yeah, do I have time to change?

05:27.081 --> 05:28.651
- I mean, what should I wear?
- No, no. I-I don't...

05:28.670 --> 05:30.201
I don't think that's what she meant.

05:30.221 --> 05:31.856
I think four could be a crowd.

05:31.877 --> 05:34.098
Not if you're rotating holes.

05:34.694 --> 05:35.723
What?

05:35.898 --> 05:38.235
Like in the movies.

05:38.901 --> 05:41.189
Eh...

05:41.668 --> 05:42.273
Okay.

05:42.358 --> 05:43.524
Hmm.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.507
Guess he's not a film buff.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.593
Maya, get your head off the table.

05:56.096 --> 05:57.064
Maya?

05:58.340 --> 06:00.173
I was so bad today.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.175
That's the lowest beam score I've ever had.

06:03.262 --> 06:05.177
Honey, you'll do better tomorrow.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.346
It wasn't your fault.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.045
Whose fault was it?

06:08.064 --> 06:09.348
The judges.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.319
Well, one of them, in particular.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.523
Girls, go wash your hands.

06:19.244 --> 06:20.817
What are you doing?

06:20.942 --> 06:22.362
You don't think it's weird that the judge

06:22.413 --> 06:24.694
who gave our daughter the lowest score

06:24.713 --> 06:27.367
happens to be the only
one I've had sex with?

06:27.452 --> 06:28.584
No.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.504
Look...

06:30.538 --> 06:33.990
I was really shitty to Kristi.

06:34.312 --> 06:36.259
Like, really shitty.

06:36.345 --> 06:38.899
- Okay?
- Shitty how?

06:39.064 --> 06:41.105
When you and I got back together

06:41.125 --> 06:44.504
I didn't do the best job

06:45.257 --> 06:47.189
breaking up with her.

06:47.805 --> 06:49.305
l don't understand.

06:50.021 --> 06:52.151
Haven't you ever, you know,

06:52.172 --> 06:54.167
quit a job by just...

06:54.187 --> 06:56.146
not showing up?

06:57.338 --> 06:58.281
Russ...

06:58.367 --> 07:01.233
It was before texting.

07:01.836 --> 07:03.810
You suck.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.245
There he is.

07:13.331 --> 07:14.973
Handsome man.

07:14.994 --> 07:16.332
Oh, good.

07:16.418 --> 07:18.250
I was afraid I was gonna
have to go on this date

07:18.302 --> 07:19.586
- all by myself.
- That's why we're here.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.555
Since you're newly single,
we've been researching

07:21.589 --> 07:23.389
dating tips on the Internet.

07:23.425 --> 07:26.281
Turns out there are
many schools of thought.

07:26.665 --> 07:28.427
- I'm good.
- Tip number one...

07:28.480 --> 07:29.802
Okay.

07:29.822 --> 07:33.365
When the waiter brings you your menus,

07:33.543 --> 07:35.268
you might want to mention
that one in five children

07:35.353 --> 07:38.271
have an alcoholic adult
living inside their home.

07:38.322 --> 07:39.572
This is good. This will set up the mood.

07:39.608 --> 07:41.441
Number two

07:41.492 --> 07:42.658
When you bring the young lady home,

07:42.744 --> 07:44.528
turn the lights down real low,

07:44.612 --> 07:46.446
and remind her that children of addicts

07:46.497 --> 07:48.665
are three times more likely
to become addicts themselves.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.500
You're absolutely right.

07:50.586 --> 07:52.451
A beautiful woman wants
to take me to dinner,

07:52.504 --> 07:54.286
but instead of rebuilding my life,

07:54.372 --> 07:55.538
I should hawk your book.

07:55.624 --> 07:58.567
Hey... why rebuild right away?

07:58.588 --> 07:59.425
Wallow in it.

07:59.461 --> 08:01.461
Spiral down, bro.

08:01.512 --> 08:03.262
You're doing it wrong.

08:03.973 --> 08:05.096
Good.

08:05.411 --> 08:07.178
Move the piece of shit.

08:07.411 --> 08:08.300
All right. Actually it gets

08:08.353 --> 08:10.437
very good pickup for a
no-emissions vehicle.

08:10.471 --> 08:13.557
Okay. Okay.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:27.608 --> 08:29.288
Ma'am, I'm with hotel security.

08:29.324 --> 08:32.241
We have a strict non-soliciting policy...

08:32.326 --> 08:35.203
so, no working girls.

08:37.711 --> 08:39.280
Uh, it was...

08:39.301 --> 08:41.994
- funny in my head when I was...
- I'm actually meeting someone.

08:42.014 --> 08:46.173
Oh. Uh... boyfriend or husband?

08:46.258 --> 08:49.001
That's none of your business.

08:49.561 --> 08:51.825
Well... can I...

08:52.029 --> 08:53.907
talk to you while you wait?

08:54.126 --> 08:55.374
Fine.

08:55.784 --> 08:57.148
Um...

08:58.970 --> 09:02.067
Something is really bothering me
for the last...

09:02.341 --> 09:05.158
- I don't know.
- 15 years?

09:07.739 --> 09:09.578
Right. Um...

09:10.528 --> 09:12.164
I just feel like we didn't, you know,

09:12.201 --> 09:14.201
leave things on a great note.

09:14.285 --> 09:16.140
A note would've,
would've been great.

09:16.161 --> 09:18.254
Anything.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.206
In my defense,

09:20.226 --> 09:23.426
it was before text... texting.

09:25.639 --> 09:28.270
Um, but that's-that's no excuse.

09:28.572 --> 09:30.383
I... I...

09:30.469 --> 09:32.640
apologize...

09:33.304 --> 09:35.304
deeply, sincerely...

09:35.389 --> 09:37.307
from the bottom of my heart.

09:37.392 --> 09:39.475
I-I feel terrible.

09:40.217 --> 09:42.528
So we are cool?

09:43.157 --> 09:47.411
Do I forgive you?
Is-is that what you're asking me?

09:47.796 --> 09:50.084
No. I mean, I was...

09:50.104 --> 09:51.571
just...

09:52.105 --> 09:54.231
Yeah, I guess. I guess.

09:54.251 --> 09:55.542
Yes.

09:55.576 --> 09:58.294
No. I don't forgive you.

09:59.715 --> 10:01.581
Good night.

10:11.426 --> 10:12.424
Ooh.

10:15.347 --> 10:17.495
- Hi.
- Hi!

10:17.515 --> 10:18.398
- Hi.
- Oh.

10:18.432 --> 10:19.566
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.163
Hi.

10:21.461 --> 10:23.602
Hi, sorry I'm late.
I got stuck on a call.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.272
Oh, not a... not a problem.

10:26.442 --> 10:28.073
It is nice to see you.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.275
And you.

10:29.327 --> 10:30.911
Thank you.

10:32.610 --> 10:33.363
Okay, just...

10:33.447 --> 10:35.470
just remind me how this works again?

10:36.215 --> 10:38.250
- Dating?
- Yeah.

10:38.287 --> 10:39.619
We eat and we talk

10:39.671 --> 10:41.538
and we pretend to be better
than we actually are?

10:41.623 --> 10:43.255
Yeah, that's pretty much how we do it.

10:43.292 --> 10:44.374
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

10:44.459 --> 10:46.426
So my criminal history,

10:46.461 --> 10:48.260
- my medical records... Put that off?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:48.297 --> 10:49.379
Yeah. That's-that's second date.

10:49.463 --> 10:50.547
- Second date.
- That's second date.

10:50.631 --> 10:52.298
So the first date would be all lies?

10:52.384 --> 10:53.716
Pretty much, yeah. Yeah.

10:54.629 --> 10:55.982
Uh...

10:56.268 --> 10:58.221
I'm a volunteer fireman.

10:58.307 --> 10:59.471
But I only do small fires.

11:03.711 --> 11:06.645
Some pendants...
what I've got is pendants...

11:06.697 --> 11:09.316
um, necklaces...

11:09.368 --> 11:10.450
Watches? Do you do those?

11:10.485 --> 11:12.657
I don't do watches, no.

11:20.724 --> 11:22.245
Just do a chandelier?

11:22.376 --> 11:24.547
I feel like a chandelier would
look good with your face shape.

11:24.633 --> 11:26.136
I really love chandeliers.

11:26.869 --> 11:28.585
Hey...
I-I couldn't help but think

11:28.669 --> 11:31.638
about what you just said
and do you have one more minute?

11:31.673 --> 11:33.340
Uh, sor... I'm with clients right now.

11:33.424 --> 11:34.474
I know, I know.

11:34.509 --> 11:36.676
I just... I want to apologize

11:36.727 --> 11:39.229
for-for everything, you know,
that's happened between us.

11:39.313 --> 11:41.190
Uh, yeah, you already have.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.264
I know,

11:42.350 --> 11:43.515
but when you were over there,
I felt like you...

11:43.601 --> 11:45.601
What is it you really want?

11:45.687 --> 11:47.653
I just want to make you feel better,

11:47.688 --> 11:50.523
- but you're not letting me.
- Oh, so now you're the victim?

11:50.575 --> 11:51.658
No, no, you're the victim.

11:51.692 --> 11:53.275
I'm-I'm not the victim.

11:53.361 --> 11:54.443
I-I-I victimized you.

11:54.528 --> 11:56.528
Big time. Is everything okay, or...?

11:56.615 --> 11:59.042
- Should we call security?
- No, no, it's fine.

11:59.062 --> 12:01.500
- It's fine.
- No, it's not fine.

12:02.225 --> 12:05.352
We dated a million years ago,
and now he won't leave me alone.

12:05.373 --> 12:06.456
I...

12:06.541 --> 12:08.424
I was just trying to apologize,

12:08.509 --> 12:11.980
you know, for not letting her
know that we were broken up.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.214
You know, she has some very bad

12:14.298 --> 12:15.432
feelings about me, and it's-it's not good

12:15.517 --> 12:16.548
for her to hold onto them.

12:16.634 --> 12:18.268
How about apologizing

12:18.352 --> 12:19.686
for not telling me that you were engaged?

12:19.721 --> 12:21.388
Yes, that's good.

12:21.472 --> 12:23.222
- That's a great example.
- Okay. Fine.

12:23.274 --> 12:24.224
You want to talk about this?

12:24.275 --> 12:26.609
- Yes.
- You want to hear how depressed I was?

12:26.695 --> 12:28.278
How I couldn't get out
of bed for three months?

12:28.363 --> 12:30.190
How I stopped eating?

12:30.847 --> 12:32.399
Yeah, I mean...

12:32.484 --> 12:34.234
you know, maybe in another room somewhere.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.618
I was destroyed, Russ.

12:37.248 --> 12:38.571
You know,
I knew that you would get back together

12:38.657 --> 12:39.706
with Lina.

12:39.740 --> 12:41.323
That I was just a detour.

12:41.409 --> 12:43.293
You were not just a detour, okay?

12:43.378 --> 12:44.575
Oh, what was I, then?

12:44.595 --> 12:46.970
You were... a...

12:46.990 --> 12:50.056
like a backpacking trip through Europe.

12:50.576 --> 12:52.719
With incredible architecture

12:52.754 --> 12:55.169
that has stood the test of time,
by the way.

12:56.558 --> 12:59.558
Look, I was an idiot back then, okay?

12:59.594 --> 13:01.510
But now I've-I've changed.

13:01.596 --> 13:04.179
I'm-I'm just a-a good dad

13:04.265 --> 13:05.432
and a decent husband.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.317
And that's why I blocked you on Facebook,

13:07.402 --> 13:08.600
because I didn't want to
see pictures of your happy

13:08.687 --> 13:10.467
little family.

13:17.446 --> 13:19.245
They're not that happy.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.393
I mean, we're fine, but it's not...

13:23.696 --> 13:25.357
It's ups and downs. Yeah.

13:28.816 --> 13:29.898
So, what happened?

13:29.982 --> 13:31.817
I want all the details.

13:32.607 --> 13:33.985
No, you don't.

13:34.071 --> 13:36.205
All you care about is your book.

13:36.225 --> 13:38.706
Which she's passing on, by the way.

13:38.792 --> 13:39.825
What?

13:39.909 --> 13:41.206
Mm-hmm. Shit.

13:41.225 --> 13:42.658
Yep.

13:42.677 --> 13:45.713
See you next time you need a favor.

13:48.806 --> 13:50.245
Is everything okay, man?

13:50.265 --> 13:53.004
Yeah, yeah. You bet.

13:53.056 --> 13:54.871
Well...

13:54.892 --> 13:57.402
You know, I've been better.

13:57.422 --> 13:59.399
Well, what else happened on the date?

13:59.419 --> 14:01.385
Did you guys have bad sex?

14:01.509 --> 14:02.677
Hey, hey.

14:02.697 --> 14:04.873
A gentleman does not kiss and tell.

14:04.893 --> 14:06.573
- Sure he does.
- Well. I don't.

14:06.594 --> 14:08.373
Sure you do.

14:08.393 --> 14:09.443
Okay.

14:09.464 --> 14:11.379
Well, we-we did not have intercourse.

14:11.399 --> 14:12.496
There you go.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.942
- Oh... oh.
- You happy?

14:14.961 --> 14:18.864
She probably could detect your sadness.

14:18.948 --> 14:21.692
Mm? That happened to me a lot
after Roxanne and I split up.

14:21.712 --> 14:23.566
They can smell it. It's a big turnoff.

14:23.586 --> 14:25.241
No. No.

14:25.261 --> 14:27.788
She was very willing.

14:27.875 --> 14:29.498
I was actually the one...

14:29.518 --> 14:31.876
- With the boner problems.
- No.

14:31.961 --> 14:34.044
- Are you sure?
- No boner problems.

14:34.096 --> 14:35.053
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:35.073 --> 14:36.294
Because after Roxanne left me,

14:36.315 --> 14:38.653
I practically had to tie it to a stick.

14:38.673 --> 14:40.352
Hey. Okay, no.

14:40.373 --> 14:41.794
There was no need for a stick.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.123
Okay. All right.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.724
What is the deal, then?

14:45.808 --> 14:47.392
No sad smell, no boner problems.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.811
I don't get it. Come on.

14:51.731 --> 14:53.981
We were naked...

14:54.067 --> 14:57.952
- Ooh. Mm!
- ...and I started thinking about Jess.

15:01.376 --> 15:03.908
Right. Yeah.

15:04.510 --> 15:05.910
I get it.

15:05.962 --> 15:07.043
Hmm.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.046
Vagina twin.

15:10.778 --> 15:12.441
Beg your pardon?

15:12.565 --> 15:14.421
Every woman has a vagina twin.

15:14.441 --> 15:19.818
That's when two women look
exactly the same down there.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.726
You found Jess's vagina twin,

15:22.763 --> 15:24.350
and you couldn't go through with it.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.897
Good call.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.850
Yes. Finally someone who gets it.

15:29.937 --> 15:32.244
I do, and you know what?

15:32.504 --> 15:34.739
I think you should be proud of yourself.

15:35.955 --> 15:36.857
Mm. Why?

15:36.943 --> 15:39.182
'Cause my wife left me,
or 'cause I'm in too much pain

15:39.201 --> 15:42.061
to actually have sex with another woman?

15:45.683 --> 15:49.505
Because you took the first step.

15:56.769 --> 15:58.866
Yeah, I... yes, I did.

15:58.886 --> 16:01.966
Well, all right. Well, good for me.

16:02.052 --> 16:03.768
And you'll get 'em next time.

16:03.803 --> 16:05.803
Unless... Wait a second.

16:05.855 --> 16:07.116
Is there such a thing as vagina triplets?

16:07.136 --> 16:08.903
Oh! I wish.

16:08.923 --> 16:11.014
Oh, boy.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.245
Before the medal ceremony,

16:14.298 --> 16:15.581
how about a round of applause

16:15.666 --> 16:17.751
for all of our gymnasts?!

16:23.672 --> 16:25.495
Our first set of medals today...

16:25.515 --> 16:27.558
I'm not gonna win.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.005
- You don't know that, honey.
- Yeah, I think we do.

16:30.025 --> 16:32.605
Don't listen to your father.
Your scores were excellent.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.432
- They should have been better.
- Russ!

16:34.485 --> 16:37.152
And balance checks.

16:37.674 --> 16:40.864
And the bronze medal for beam goes to...

16:41.360 --> 16:42.356
Maya Bowman.

16:42.442 --> 16:44.442
- No way!
- Oh, my God!

16:45.578 --> 16:47.446
We medaled! We medaled!

16:47.530 --> 16:49.331
- We medaled!
- Congratulations.

16:49.415 --> 16:50.532
Thank you.

16:54.587 --> 16:58.123
The silver medal for beam goes to

16:58.174 --> 16:59.591
Caitlyn Silver.

17:03.264 --> 17:05.180
Hey. Hey... Oh.

17:05.266 --> 17:06.515
I... I heard about what Russ did,

17:06.598 --> 17:08.267
and-and, you know, I just...

17:08.300 --> 17:09.518
Are you kidding me?

17:09.603 --> 17:11.470
I want to apologize for him.

17:11.555 --> 17:13.221
He feels terrible.

17:13.307 --> 17:15.272
- I... I don't want to do this.
- No, no.

17:15.308 --> 17:18.608
I get it, okay? I get it.

17:18.645 --> 17:20.528
He made you feel like a piece of shit.

17:20.614 --> 17:22.280
Like a worthless piece of shit.

17:22.316 --> 17:24.482
- I never felt like that.
- No.

17:24.567 --> 17:28.367
Of course not, but... if you did,

17:28.387 --> 17:30.622
and I had anything to do with it,
I just wanted to say...

17:30.657 --> 17:33.325
Jesus,
so now I have to make you feel better, too?

17:33.410 --> 17:35.493
No! I feel fine.

17:35.578 --> 17:38.246
We didn't... We just wanted to...

17:39.619 --> 17:41.857
I'm sorry. Okay.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.051
Before you send your girls
out here to talk to me,

17:45.072 --> 17:46.988
I just want to tell you, I'm fine.

17:47.008 --> 17:50.174
- It's ancient history.
- Exactly.

17:51.338 --> 17:54.179
I just wish I hadn't lost those clients
because of all the drama.

17:54.263 --> 17:55.748
I'm so sorry.

17:55.768 --> 17:57.348
What kind of clients?

17:57.401 --> 18:01.185
Uh, I sell designer jewelry.

18:01.270 --> 18:03.355
Designer jewelry.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.574
I love this. It's so sparkly.

18:05.659 --> 18:07.526
- Pretty.
- Well, don't be shy.

18:07.577 --> 18:09.443
You can try on anything you like.

18:09.529 --> 18:11.529
Hey, I love this.
Here's the price sheet.

18:11.615 --> 18:13.365
Oh.

18:13.416 --> 18:15.334
Hand me those rings.

18:17.019 --> 18:21.020
Hey, is there any, uh,
friends and family discount?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.375
You know, just 'cause of our...

18:24.446 --> 18:26.284
connection?

18:29.125 --> 18:31.516
Okay, maybe...
maybe one small thing each, guys?

18:37.862 --> 18:40.872
I really love my new guilt bracelet.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.941
Do you have any
exes who design shoes?

18:43.961 --> 18:47.736
Would have been so much cheaper
had I just listened to you.

18:47.788 --> 18:50.372
You were in rare form this weekend.

18:50.407 --> 18:54.755
I just saw her, and it took me back
to being 25, you know?

18:55.201 --> 18:57.112
So many girls were hot for me then.

18:57.132 --> 18:58.490
Like millions.

18:58.509 --> 19:00.512
And you treated 'em like shit.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.038
I was so good at it.

19:05.693 --> 19:07.208
So do you ever think about
what it would be like

19:07.228 --> 19:10.011
if you would've married
Kristi instead of me?

19:10.031 --> 19:11.477
No.

19:14.290 --> 19:16.126
Although I do think about
what it would be like

19:16.146 --> 19:18.695
if you had the flexibility of a gymnast.

19:18.715 --> 19:22.021
I get it.
So Maya's gonna be really good at sex.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.583
Okay. Don't ever do that.

19:24.603 --> 19:26.420
Ever.
