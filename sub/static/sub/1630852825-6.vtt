WEBVTT

00:27.485 --> 00:28.611
Um…

00:28.695 --> 00:29.571
I'm an artist.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.948
He's really talented.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.534
You've seen my work?

00:36.494 --> 00:38.246
You know, Vivian says.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.205
Oh.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.458
Would we have seen your work somewhere?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.878
Uh, ever go to the galleries
on the Lower East Side?

00:46.504 --> 00:49.090
Um, little kids make it hard
to go anywhere.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.055
-It's…
-Oh.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.347
There she is!

00:56.431 --> 00:58.183
Hi, hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.643
-Vivian, hello!
-You are Mags.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.270
-It's nice to finally meet you.
-Oh.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.234
-Hey.
-What? It's fine.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.694
Hey.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.322
So…

01:12.405 --> 01:13.323
I got it.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.575
Holy shit. Seriously?

01:15.658 --> 01:18.078
-Oh, yeah.
-What did you get? What did they get?

01:18.661 --> 01:19.537
I have no idea.

01:19.621 --> 01:24.334
Are you just gonna sit there,
or are you gonna whip this out? Oh, yes!

01:24.417 --> 01:26.169
Uh… Todd…

01:29.380 --> 01:30.381
Come here.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.674
Come, come, come, come, come.

01:33.051 --> 01:37.388
Okay, so, at first
it's just a bunch of shots of Anna

01:37.472 --> 01:39.224
shopping, playing tennis,

01:39.307 --> 01:41.559
lounging by the pool,
like a normal vacation,

01:41.643 --> 01:46.481
if your vacation is at a Moroccan hotel
that costs almost $10,000 a night.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.607
But then…

01:48.191 --> 01:51.277
<i>-Please. Please, please.</i>
<i>-If you don't put the fucking camera down…</i>

01:51.361 --> 01:52.779
<i>-Turn it off!</i>
-The fuck?

01:54.072 --> 01:54.989
Right?

01:55.865 --> 01:57.784
That's it, before it's back to tennis.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.203
Oh… Uh…

02:00.286 --> 02:05.875
So Anna has one last shot
to get her funding for her club, right?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.420
And one big loan that can come through.

02:09.504 --> 02:13.133
And while she's waiting for it,
while she has zero dollars,

02:13.216 --> 02:18.346
she packs up her friends and goes
on this expensive trip to Morocco.

02:18.429 --> 02:19.597
Uh…

02:19.681 --> 02:21.724
-That's what this is about.
-Oh.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.060
-You already know this whole story.
-Mm-hmm.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.688
-Yeah, me too.
-It's all he talks about.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.814
I am an Anna expert.

02:27.897 --> 02:28.857
No, exactly.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.317
It's literally
the only thing she ever talks about.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.903
There's a wall
in our house devoted to this.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.947
He sleeps with Anna files next to our bed.

02:37.198 --> 02:40.160
I'm pretty sure she's gonna try
and name our baby Anna Delvey Kent.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.662
-You should call Social Services.
-That's what I said.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.497
Show us some more footage.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.875
Well, there's this one part…

02:47.917 --> 02:50.837
<i>-Please. Please, please.</i>
<i>-If you don't put the fucking camera down…</i>

02:50.920 --> 02:51.754
<i>Turn it off!</i>

02:53.131 --> 02:55.633
-Thank you for sending me the footage.
-Yeah, of course.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.761
If there's a chance <i>Manhattan Magazine</i>
would license it for the site,

02:58.845 --> 03:00.930
I'd be happy to talk about an arrangement.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.850
Ooh. Maybe.
I'll look through it some more.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.853
So how did you end up on the trip?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.397
Uh…

03:09.480 --> 03:12.775
I do videography work
with Rachel at <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

03:12.859 --> 03:13.776
She brought me in.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.280
Did Anna say
why she wanted the trip filmed?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.656
I don't really know.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.453
She and Rachel had seen
that Khloé Kardashian had posted something

03:23.536 --> 03:25.455
from the hotel a few months prior.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.751
I think Anna imagined
she was testing her own reality show

03:29.834 --> 03:31.669
or a documentary, or…

03:31.753 --> 03:33.796
The reason was a bit shifty.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.881
Mm, interesting.

03:35.715 --> 03:39.219
So, can you tell me what happened?

03:39.802 --> 03:42.513
I mean, the footage is great,
but it doesn't explain.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.600
How does
a Khloé Kardashian-inspired vacation

03:45.683 --> 03:47.060
turn into a felony charge?

03:47.143 --> 03:51.231
Look. Again, if the site wants
to use the footage, that's one thing,

03:51.314 --> 03:54.442
but I don't know that I'm really
comfortable talking about the details.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.362
If my work finds out,
it's not a great look.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.948
But I don't have to use your name.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.200
Yeah. I've got to protect myself.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.577
And Rachel. And Kacy.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.957
You should ask Rachel.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.292
I've been trying. I can't find her.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.379
I'm sorry, you kind of caught me
at a bad time. I gotta meet a client.

04:14.462 --> 04:18.299
I just want to know
how Rachel ended up paying for everything.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.343
Do you think Anna coerced her somehow?

04:20.426 --> 04:22.262
Really, I've got to meet a client, so…

04:22.345 --> 04:24.097
Can you at least
tell me about the footage?

04:25.306 --> 04:26.683
You've seen the footage?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.623
Good morning, Ms. Duke.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.708
Morning, Bobby.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.002
<i>Good, now we're warming up.</i>

04:54.085 --> 04:55.420
Don't forget to breathe.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.297
Good.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.799
-What are you?
-I'm a bad bitch!

04:59.882 --> 05:01.134
Who's the star of this movie?

05:01.217 --> 05:02.760
A bad bitch is!

05:02.844 --> 05:03.928
Let's go!

05:04.012 --> 05:07.390
I told him,
I'm not having his kids come to my event.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.559
They're just going
to suck the air out of the room

05:09.642 --> 05:11.060
like little emotional vampires.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.479
You've get to get back
what you're putting in.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.689
Or your well goes dry.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.149
Little eight-year-old assholes.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.154
So the suite
could fit three of us.

05:21.237 --> 05:24.615
Two in the master, one on the couch,
but it might be kind of tight, right?

05:24.699 --> 05:27.952
It might just be more ideal
to get two adjoining suites,

05:28.036 --> 05:29.829
then everyone has their space.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.248
-We should book it today.
-I don't have time today.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.499
I could book it for us.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.835
I book travel
for people at work all the time.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.921
-You could just pay me back.
-Let's keep our heads in the workout.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.049
-Ah.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.051
-Anna…
-But it could be about my loan.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.063
Have you heard from them?

05:55.146 --> 05:55.980
<i>Hi, Anna.</i>

05:56.064 --> 05:58.775
That's why I'm calling.
I just got off with Fortress.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.028
I know we were hoping
they'd have due diligence done by today,

06:02.111 --> 06:04.155
but unfortunately, they need more time.

06:04.238 --> 06:07.617
How much more time can they need?
We've given them everything they wanted.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.078
We have.
I think they're just taking a closer look.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.829
<i>I'll call you as soon as I hear.</i>

06:13.664 --> 06:14.957
Everything okay?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.129
Um…

06:24.384 --> 06:25.259
You know what?

06:25.343 --> 06:27.011
I don't want the suites.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.014
When my loans come through,
I might have to start working,

06:30.098 --> 06:31.307
so I'll need more space.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.727
Let's book the private riad.

06:35.103 --> 06:35.978
Really?

06:36.062 --> 06:36.979
Mm-hmm.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.358
What are you doing next week, Kacy?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.987
You're going to Morocco
and it's not for vacation?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.572
My work's a little different.

06:47.198 --> 06:52.245
So you're going to cut this short
and go to bed early for a young girl?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.164
You know, I'm pretty secure,

06:55.248 --> 06:58.042
but at a certain point,
a guy starts to wonder.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.128
Trust me.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.923
I want you to come upstairs, it's just…

07:04.882 --> 07:05.758
What?

07:07.677 --> 07:09.137
I'll make you breakfast.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.179
Martin.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.349
You can be breakfast.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.267
Oh.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.444
I'm sorry, I gotta go to sleep.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.987
I have a plane to catch.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.321
Call me when you're back?

07:27.405 --> 07:28.406
Okay.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.318
It's so beautiful. Isn't it?

08:47.401 --> 08:48.861
It's, like, such a rich culture.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.112
It's just a building.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.533
Yves Saint Laurent had a second home here
just outside the city.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.910
It's supposed to be incredible,

08:55.993 --> 08:58.246
like, two acres of gardens
and this amazing villa.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.622
I've always wanted--

08:59.705 --> 09:01.916
Can you film me?
We need, like, an entrance shot.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.776
What are they doing?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.736
They're checking for bombs.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.905
Why would there be bombs?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.700
We're at the most
expensive resort in Morocco.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.202
All the money in the world
can't buy peace.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.270
Welcome.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.439
May I offer you a tour of the property?

10:10.318 --> 10:12.612
La Mamounia was gifted to Prince Al Mamoun

10:12.695 --> 10:15.656
by his father
in the 18th century as a wedding present.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.703
Framed by the Atlas Mountains to the north
and Koutoubia Mosque to the east,

10:20.786 --> 10:23.539
our gardens date back to the 12th century,

10:23.623 --> 10:29.337
with some olive trees three times older
than some certain unnamed countries.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.840
Since becoming a hotel in 1923,

10:32.923 --> 10:37.053
the property has welcomed
some of my personal favorite dignitaries.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.140
Including Winston Churchill,
Franklin Roosevelt, Nelson Mandela--

10:41.223 --> 10:44.685
Oh, my God,
this is where Khloé posted from!

10:46.145 --> 10:47.521
Let's take a selfie.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.026
One of Churchill's
favorite activities, I think.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.570
-Hang on.
-Let's do both.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.490
Is this what
they brought you here to film? Selfies?

10:57.615 --> 11:00.034
I'm not really sure.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.704
She said something about documenting
the building of her business and…

11:04.205 --> 11:07.291
I needed the money.
I'm waiting on a couple of paychecks, so…

11:07.375 --> 11:09.960
Baby, you do what they want you to do,

11:10.044 --> 11:13.047
go where they want you to go,
and you might get a great film,

11:13.130 --> 11:15.049
but you'll definitely
get a great experience.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.134
The universe provides
what you're meant to have.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.096
Huh. And, uh, what are you meant to have?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.518
Three pounds off Anna. A vacation, I hope.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.940
Shall we continue on to your riad?

11:31.774 --> 11:32.983
Hmm.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.800
Oh, my God, this is incredible.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.972
Okay, you've got to come see this.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.104
Wow.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.190
Oh, yeah.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.277
There is seriously good energy out here.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.361
Where's Anna?

12:28.998 --> 12:30.124
Hi.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.250
What was that about?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.795
Nothing. What are we doing?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.342
Mountain.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.637
Dancer.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.056
So would you
go to the gardens growing up here?

12:46.974 --> 12:49.101
Like, what a cute place
to grow up next to.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.478
It is nice.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.356
I gave them so much paperwork right away,
and they take a week to get back to me.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.357
I'm tired of waiting.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.652
<i>So there are supposed to be</i>
<i>incredible food stalls in Medina,</i>

12:58.736 --> 13:01.572
<i>but I guess I'm squeamish</i>
<i>about my stomach, but what's awesome…</i>

13:01.655 --> 13:03.324
<i>Warrior two, keep it pretty.</i>

13:03.407 --> 13:05.826
…is the Jardin Majorelle,
the Yves Saint Laurent gardens…

13:05.910 --> 13:07.161
The gardens…

13:07.244 --> 13:08.662
…go to the YSL gardens.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.332
But it's going to be sick
when I get the money.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.833
-Anna!
-Oops.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.502
<i>It has this terrific café.</i>

13:14.585 --> 13:15.878
<i>We could kill a couple birds…</i>

13:15.961 --> 13:19.089
The restaurant's good here.
I just want to enjoy the hotel for now.

13:19.173 --> 13:22.510
This is actually
a good learning experience being here.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.428
They've got a lot of things right,

13:24.512 --> 13:26.764
but ADF will be better
than this place, I think.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.933
<i>Our spa will be more Swedish style.</i>

13:29.016 --> 13:31.727
So we have to see
the Medina, obviously. Shopping.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.688
But maybe we could
have some Moroccan influence.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.857
I can bring my travels into the design.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.568
We should see the mosque,
just to be respectful.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.197
Serve tea in mugs
with the Anna Delvey Foundation logo.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.824
There's also this incredible gate.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.785
It sounds like baba ganoush,
but is more like Baba Agnow?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.286
Or Baba Agnew? What else?

13:49.370 --> 13:52.248
Don't forget about the gardens.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.133
I wonder what Noah's doing now.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.513
It's weird we never really talk at work.
We have so much in common.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.223
I know. Totally.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.350
Shall we order drinks?

14:11.433 --> 14:13.894
I had champagne earlier.
I don't like to drink much.

14:13.978 --> 14:14.895
What about food?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.231
Yes, I'm starving.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.735
What do you guys think?

14:21.819 --> 14:24.196
The four-course menu
might not be enough food.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.031
-Should we maybe do the six?
-Great.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.911
Oh. So I was thinking, tomorrow,
should we get a car to take us into town?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.372
The Medina's
supposed to be best in the morning,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.666
perfect for an afternoon tour
of the gardens.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.711
Rachel, enough with the gardens.
Who cares about the gardens?

14:42.131 --> 14:45.426
I mean, so what do you want to see?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.555
The spa, the other restaurant.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.224
But we came all this way.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.811
We're not just going to stay in the hotel
and not see Marrakesh, right?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.105
We're at one of the best hotels
in the world.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.442
We have whatever we need here.
Why would we leave?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.280
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> may I have a word?

15:14.830 --> 15:15.664
Ugh.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.749
Shut up, Kacy.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.875
Excuse me.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.252
-God.
-What's going on with those two?

15:20.336 --> 15:23.464
It's like you're a walking, talking
bumper sticker. Why are you here?

15:23.547 --> 15:26.550
Is this normal for you to hang out
with a bunch of twentysomethings?

15:26.634 --> 15:27.635
Oh.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.094
I am not feeling well.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.804
Oh, my God, dramatic much?

15:30.888 --> 15:32.056
You don't look so good.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.768
I think I'm going to be sick.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.978
I'm going to be sick.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.480
Okay, let's get you back.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.199
<i>I ate the exact same food</i>
<i>as everybody else from the airport on,</i>

15:50.282 --> 15:52.117
<i>but I was the only one who got sick.</i>

15:52.743 --> 15:54.328
What do you think happened?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.414
I'll tell you.
I don't think it was Morocco.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.167
I think it was the universe.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.295
Protecting me.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.799
I didn't know it then. But I know it now.

16:13.597 --> 16:17.226
I'm going to walk her out to the car
and then go film some B-roll.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.936
Okay. Um…

16:19.478 --> 16:21.480
Kacy, I'm really sorry about last night.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.274
I think I was just hungry.
I'm so sorry you have to leave.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.734
It's fine.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.319
Feel better.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.789
Did you get the vacation
the universe meant you to have?

16:38.872 --> 16:39.873
Don't.

16:41.792 --> 16:42.793
Where are you going?

16:42.876 --> 16:45.879
Uh, she's heading to the airport.
She's not feeling well.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.928
<i>I was in bed for six days.</i>

16:53.012 --> 16:56.473
Do you know what six whole days
in bed feels like to a fitness junkie?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.225
After being on a plane for ten hours,

16:58.308 --> 17:00.936
feeling like death
with crap coming out of both ends.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.354
And all for a job? No.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.530
Hey, Anna.

17:54.281 --> 17:58.285
<i>Oh, my God, I'm…</i>
<i>I'm so glad you picked up.</i>

17:58.368 --> 18:00.412
What's going on? You still in Morocco?

18:01.121 --> 18:04.083
<i>Kacy, I-I got mugged.</i>

18:05.084 --> 18:06.001
Honey.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.670
What happened? You okay?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.255
<i>I'm, I'm still here.</i>

18:10.339 --> 18:14.760
<i>I got mugged,</i>
<i>and I don't have any of my credit cards.</i>

18:14.843 --> 18:17.763
<i>And I have no way of getting out of here.</i>

18:17.846 --> 18:19.473
How did it happen? Are you hurt?

18:19.556 --> 18:24.603
<i>I'm okay,</i>
<i>but I really need to get a flight.</i>

18:24.686 --> 18:25.938
<i>I can pay you back.</i>

18:26.021 --> 18:28.398
Of course, sweetheart.
I-I'm on the site already.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.194
<i>-Kacy…</i>
-Yeah?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.572
<i>Can you buy me a first-class ticket?</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:38.075
Child.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.160
No, I didn't buy her first class.
Is she crazy?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.496
<i>She's a little crazy, right?</i>

18:42.579 --> 18:45.499
Yeah. I mean,
it does sound really scary though.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.417
<i>Did you know she got mugged?</i>

18:48.335 --> 18:49.753
You're not still there, are you?

18:49.837 --> 18:53.799
No. Noah and I left a few days ago.
We had to get back to work, you know.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.425
I hope she's okay.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.470
You think I'll see my money back?

18:58.554 --> 18:59.805
I think so.

18:59.888 --> 19:03.225
I paid for some things in Morocco
because her card was having issues.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.561
A lot of banks
won't do business in Morocco.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.562
Right.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.480
<i>Getting your cards stolen</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:10.899
on top of all that. Mm.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.859
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:12.693 --> 19:13.819
Are you feeling any better?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.199
Actually, I am.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.504
Where you going?

19:36.842 --> 19:37.759
Water.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.262
It's my very last bottle.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.224
We'll have to ration it
if we work up a sweat.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.781
Please don't answer that.

20:06.413 --> 20:10.167
I'm sorry, that line never rings.
It could be my kid.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.552
Hello?

20:20.636 --> 20:22.471
I'm sorry to call so late, Ms. Duke.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.805
What is it, Bobby?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.599
There's someone here to see you.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.516
What?

20:27.684 --> 20:28.518
Who is it?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.520
A Ms. Delvey.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.438
Are you…

20:32.439 --> 20:33.565
Oh, my God.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.693
Thank you, Bobby.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.321
Please tell her I'm not available.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.364
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

20:45.327 --> 20:46.245
Come here.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.102
Bobby?

21:10.185 --> 21:12.020
-Ma'am, she's crying real loud.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.563
She says it's an emergency.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.658
Okay, what is going on?

21:24.741 --> 21:28.787
It's all of it, it's everyone,

21:28.870 --> 21:33.709
it's all coming in on me
and I just don't… You know?

21:33.792 --> 21:34.668
Okay.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.170
We're going to breathe.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.856
Now I need you
to tell me what is going on.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.568
I-I've been staying at the Beekman,

21:59.651 --> 22:02.279
but my new cards
haven't come in the mail yet

22:02.362 --> 22:06.116
and my trust allowance
doesn't come until the 1st,

22:06.199 --> 22:08.910
and the business,
they don't take me seriously

22:08.994 --> 22:10.287
just because of my age.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.123
-And it's all so stupid.
-Okay, okay, listen.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.085
I know you're all about
Miss Independent Woman,

22:17.169 --> 22:19.463
but a lot has happened to you.

22:19.963 --> 22:20.964
You were mugged.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.425
Have you called your parents?

22:24.259 --> 22:26.428
My parents, they don't understand me.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.098
They don't have to understand you,
they're your parents. They love you.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.684
Kacy, please, I have nowhere to stay.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.145
Just, can I sleep over, please?

22:35.228 --> 22:36.605
Just for tonight.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.066
Honey, it really is not a good time.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.817
No, I-I'll sleep on the couch.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.403
I-I'll, I'll leave early, but just…
Please.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.113
Look, I've got someone upstairs.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.825
I-I'm sorry, but there is no way
you can sleep over tonight.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.962
Oh.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.633
Uh, it's okay.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.094
I understand.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.734
I just…

23:24.861 --> 23:26.238
I guess I'm…

23:27.614 --> 23:29.908
a little afraid to be alone tonight.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.328
I'm scared of

23:34.413 --> 23:36.498
what I might do to myself.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.838
She knew how that would affect me,
throwing suicide around like that.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.968
Because… Is that--

23:48.051 --> 23:49.594
You want to hear the rest?

23:51.012 --> 23:52.848
-Are you kidding me?
-She's a child.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.851
She's not your child. She's your client.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.728
I told you. My work is a little different.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.355
Because you let it be.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.442
I love that you're passionate. Trust me.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.069
But this? This isn't passion. This is…

24:07.070 --> 24:09.823
If you were your own life coach,
you'd tell yourself to get a life.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.451
Oh, my God.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.870
Okay. Yeah, whatever, that was lame.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.329
Look, I'm a banker.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.123
Point stands.

24:18.874 --> 24:19.875
Set some boundaries.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.712
And call me when you do.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.299
Martin, don't go. I…

24:30.927 --> 24:31.803
Hi.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.473
Bye.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.144
Anna.

24:40.395 --> 24:41.229
What?

24:43.231 --> 24:45.025
<i>She scared off my boyfriend,</i>

24:45.108 --> 24:47.777
<i>she drank my last water,</i>
<i>she took over my couch,</i>

24:47.861 --> 24:51.323
<i>she threw her clothes away</i>
<i>in the recycling bin,</i>

24:51.406 --> 24:52.866
<i>and then she tried to tell me</i>

24:52.949 --> 24:55.160
the dress I found for her,

24:55.243 --> 24:58.788
the one dress in my closet
I was willing to part with, was ugly.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.665
<i>No.</i>

25:01.750 --> 25:02.584
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

25:07.130 --> 25:08.715
She wore that dress.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.217
And from what I heard,

25:10.300 --> 25:13.345
it was the only thing she wore
for the next couple of weeks.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.138
Thanks, Kacy.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.408
Hello.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.870
<i>Rachel, what happened</i>
<i>in Morocco with Anna?</i>

25:46.169 --> 25:47.254
I…

25:47.337 --> 25:51.675
Looking back, it all made sense
why Anna never wanted to leave the hotel.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.265
But we came all this way.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.685
We're not just going to stay in the hotel
and not see Marrakesh, right?

26:01.768 --> 26:03.853
We're at one of the best hotels
in the world.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.606
We have everything we need here.
Why would we leave?

26:06.690 --> 26:10.235
Because at the hotel,
you just charge everything to the room.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.903
But once you leave…

26:13.446 --> 26:15.156
<i>I don't know how we didn't see it.</i>

26:17.576 --> 26:20.537
Oh, my God,
this is where Khloé posted from!

26:30.755 --> 26:32.173
Okay, let's do one here.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.470
Shall we continue on to your riad?

26:37.554 --> 26:39.055
-Huh.
-Yeah.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.476
Where's Anna?

26:44.019 --> 26:47.897
It is my apologies,
perhaps we have run your card incorrectly,

26:47.981 --> 26:50.317
but do you have another one,
by chance, we could run?

26:52.193 --> 26:53.028
Um, sure.

27:09.794 --> 27:10.837
What was that about?

27:11.588 --> 27:14.257
Nothing. What are we doing?

27:16.134 --> 27:18.303
I realized the clues were there all along.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.430
All along.

27:20.513 --> 27:22.432
We're at one of the best hotels
in the world.

27:22.515 --> 27:25.018
We have everything we need here.
Why would we leave?

27:26.436 --> 27:28.688
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> may I have a word?

27:43.161 --> 27:44.621
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> please.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.874
We have run all your cards,
but none of them are working.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.751
My boss is very unhappy.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.045
Why are you bothering me
in the middle of dinner?

27:53.546 --> 27:54.881
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> I'm sorry,

27:54.964 --> 27:58.343
but we need a form of payment
for the room as soon as possible.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.222
Fine, I'll send you a wire.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.640
Thank you.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.975
…to hang out
with a bunch of twentysomethings?

28:06.059 --> 28:07.227
You will call them now?

28:18.071 --> 28:19.072
Where are you going?

28:19.155 --> 28:21.700
She's heading to the airport.
She's not feeling well.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.254
-Can I help you?
-You can help yourself.

28:34.337 --> 28:36.047
We need a functioning credit card.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.216
I sent you a wire.
You can't just come in here.

28:38.299 --> 28:40.176
We have received no wire.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.096
If we do not have a payment
or a functioning credit card on file--

28:43.179 --> 28:44.681
Excuse me, we're on vacation!

28:44.764 --> 28:46.474
Can't you give them something?

28:46.558 --> 28:49.310
I'll give them a credit card
as soon as my bank clears it.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.230
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> if you do not
give us something immediately,

28:52.313 --> 28:54.691
we'll be forced
to escort you off the premises.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.152
Just give them something.
You must have something.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.361
I don't have anything!

28:58.445 --> 29:00.905
My bank
won't do business with a dirty country.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.328
-Please. Please, please.
-If you don't put the fucking camera down…

29:07.412 --> 29:08.621
-Turn it off!
-Anna!

29:08.705 --> 29:10.331
-Escort them out!
-No, please.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.793
What if… What if I put a card down,

29:13.877 --> 29:16.421
just temporarily,
until her bank sorts things out.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.672
You could use it as a hold?

29:18.381 --> 29:19.632
That would be acceptable.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.051
But it's just a hold.
Just to have on file, right?

29:22.135 --> 29:24.554
As long as we have
another card before checkout.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.308
Well, I-I'm sure my bank
will sort it out by tonight.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.199
It's fine.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.994
I'm sure it's fine.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.584
Yeah. I told you I'm not comfortable
talking about Morocco.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.585
I get it.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.297
But look, I know about the manager.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.965
About Rachel offering her card.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.259
Well, it's not like
she willingly offered her card.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.719
Anna put her in a position.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.722
So, did Anna force her?

30:11.100 --> 30:14.687
I just… I don't want you
to make her look stupid.

30:15.396 --> 30:19.275
Rachel is a smart and amazing woman.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.694
And she's your girlfriend.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.697
Well, we're not exactly…

30:24.781 --> 30:27.033
Whatever.
If that's what you're worried about,

30:27.116 --> 30:30.203
I'm not planning
on using this in the story.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.913
And I want to do Rachel justice,

30:31.996 --> 30:35.124
which is why
your perspective would really help.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.263
It's fine.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.557
I'm sure it's fine.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.183
That was so fucking rude.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.103
I'm going to leave them
a one-star review on Tripadvisor.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.523
Can you call your bank?

31:00.817 --> 31:01.651
Obviously.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.080
-What the fuck's going on?
-It-it's nothing.

31:14.914 --> 31:17.834
It was nothing. It was…
It was a misunderstanding.

31:21.671 --> 31:22.672


31:34.726 --> 31:37.520
She… Her money's international.
We're in a developing nation.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.022
People don't use that term.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.190
It's fine. Okay.
Everything's fine.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.026
Can we go back to enjoying our vacation?

31:43.109 --> 31:44.986
Rachel, that was not fine. She--

31:45.069 --> 31:46.487
I need to get out of here.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.907
Distract myself from all this drama.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.913
I was thinking
maybe we could go to that garden place.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.789
-What's it called?
-Le Jardin Majorelle?

31:56.873 --> 31:57.790
Yeah.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.584
Oh, my God, that would be…

32:01.336 --> 32:04.547
I mean, yeah.
That would be great. I would love that.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.521
-Everyone ready?
-Mm-hmm.

32:33.493 --> 32:36.913
It's kind of underwhelming.
It's just a bunch of cacti, right?

32:38.456 --> 32:40.208
It's not exactly what I'd pictured,

32:40.291 --> 32:43.670
but I think it's the interior of the house
that's supposed to be really stunning.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.297
Well, let's get the tour.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.216
Excuse me!

32:50.259 --> 32:53.680
The villa was once
the private home of Yves Saint Laurent

32:53.763 --> 32:55.723
and his partner, Pierre Bergé.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.142
The Majorelle Gardens
surrounding the property

32:58.226 --> 33:00.937
are distinguished
by the distinct color blue

33:01.020 --> 33:03.189
painted throughout
by the villa's original owner--

33:03.272 --> 33:04.565
Jacques Majorelle.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.775
-That's correct.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.944
-Is this zellige tile?
-Very good.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.240
Uh…

33:14.158 --> 33:16.119
Pretty nice exit through the gift shop.

33:16.869 --> 33:17.704
Mm.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.626
Ah.

33:24.877 --> 33:25.837
Oh.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.921
Cheers.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.469
That will be 19,185 dirham.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.764
Let me see if I have cash.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.392
Just out of curiosity,
how much is that in US dollars?

33:39.475 --> 33:43.271
We've been putting everything
on our room so we haven't quite…

33:43.354 --> 33:45.732
About 2,000 American dollars.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.028
For a tour of this little house?

33:51.821 --> 33:55.700
The donation benefits
the Bergé-Saint Laurent Foundation

33:55.783 --> 33:58.036
in its efforts to preserve haute couture.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.455
It's 500 American per person.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.665
But we're only three.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.632
My bank's still working on my card.

34:13.718 --> 34:17.305
Sorry, I don't have any cash
and money's a little tight right now, so…

34:21.434 --> 34:23.853
Oh, my God,
the hotel still has my credit card.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.693
What's that one?

34:32.653 --> 34:35.573
It's my work card,
which I obviously can't use.

34:35.656 --> 34:36.657
Um…

34:37.450 --> 34:40.119
<i>Madame,</i> we actually
have no way of paying for this.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.610
Oh, you're back.
I'm very pleased to see that you're back.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.488
Hi, I gave my card earlier
for the hotel to copy down,

35:15.571 --> 35:17.698
but they never brought it back to me.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.243
Yes, unfortunately,
I can't return that card.

35:20.326 --> 35:23.246
I've been instructed to keep it
physically on file until check-out.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.664
Write the numbers down.

35:24.747 --> 35:28.084
It's against policy to store
authentication data in our computer.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.962
Until we are authorized
to run a card for the room charges,

35:31.045 --> 35:32.630
we must have something on file.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.675
If you don't have a form of payment,
I must call the police.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.636
The police? I ju…

35:38.719 --> 35:42.598
Please. This man won't let us go
until we've paid. I need my card.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.725
Unfortunately, I've also been instructed

35:44.809 --> 35:46.853
to call the police
if this card is removed.

35:47.603 --> 35:48.521
An…

35:48.604 --> 35:50.356
I'm emailing with the bank now.

35:57.613 --> 36:00.950
Okay, the card I gave you for the hold.
It's just a hold, right?

36:01.033 --> 36:02.160
Yes, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

36:02.243 --> 36:04.245
A hold which will not actually be charged.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.413
Yes, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

36:05.496 --> 36:09.375
Okay, so what if I give you
my work card to use for the hold,

36:09.458 --> 36:11.627
and you give me
my personal card back to use for this?

36:11.711 --> 36:13.838
You can't give them your <i>Vanity Fair</i> card.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.924
I can if they don't charge it.
I don't know what else to do.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.177
Can I do that?

36:20.553 --> 36:22.597
As long as we have a card on file…

36:37.069 --> 36:39.488
You must come back
with me to the villa to run it.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.531
Okay.

36:41.532 --> 36:45.328
Excuse me,
until I have a card approved to charge,

36:45.411 --> 36:47.997
the manager
has restricted your leaving the premises.

36:48.497 --> 36:51.459
I was, unfortunately,
not supposed to let you leave earlier.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.127
That was my grave error.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.378
We have to go with him.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.676
One of you may go.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.220
-One.
-Are you--

37:02.303 --> 37:03.262
It's fine.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.722
Okay, I'll be fine.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.975
I have… him.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.568
There it is.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.369
Uh, do you have
any more of those almond cookies?

37:27.995 --> 37:28.955
Or just some water?

37:45.721 --> 37:47.515
Your card was declined.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.474
What?

37:49.225 --> 37:53.145
No, that's not possible.
Please, can you try it again?

38:06.659 --> 38:07.660
Declined.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.147


38:39.400 --> 38:42.111
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for calling American Express.</i>

38:42.945 --> 38:47.491
<i>To check your balance,</i>
<i>please press one or say "balance."</i>

38:48.326 --> 38:50.911
<i>For rewards, press two or say "rewards."</i>

38:52.955 --> 38:55.082
<i>-For international--</i>
-International.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.628
<i>You have selected "international."</i>

39:00.379 --> 39:01.213
Come on.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.007
<i>You have selected--</i>

39:03.090 --> 39:06.010
Customer support, real person.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.982
Oh, my God. Okay.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.326
<i>American Express International</i>
<i>customer support.</i>

39:30.409 --> 39:32.328
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for picking up.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.998
<i>Ma'am, I'm having</i>
<i>a little trouble hearing you, could you--</i>

39:36.082 --> 39:38.167
No, please. Please do not hang up.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.420
I am in Morocco, and I do not
want this to come across as xenophobic

39:41.504 --> 39:44.715
because this is a beautiful country
with lovely and kind people,

39:44.799 --> 39:46.884
but it is a little scary here right now

39:46.967 --> 39:49.261
because my card won't go through
and three people,

39:49.345 --> 39:52.306
one of them French, actually,
who seem to want to have me arrested.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.603
Hello?
American Express lady, hello?

40:01.190 --> 40:05.069
<i>Ma'am, how much money</i>
<i>do you need American Express to authorize</i>

40:05.152 --> 40:06.821
<i>to safely get you out of Morocco?</i>

40:06.904 --> 40:08.739
Oh, my God. Thank you.

40:09.532 --> 40:10.366
Um…

40:10.449 --> 40:12.451


40:16.455 --> 40:17.498


40:18.541 --> 40:19.375
Alan?

40:19.458 --> 40:21.919
Hi, so I just heard back from Fortress.

40:23.129 --> 40:24.505
You did? What did they say?

40:26.340 --> 40:27.299
Anna…

40:30.136 --> 40:32.972
Congratulations,
Fortress is funding your loan.

40:33.055 --> 40:35.724
Oh, my God, Alan! Oh.

40:36.308 --> 40:39.145
Alan, hold on one second.
Hold on one second.

40:39.228 --> 40:42.982
I want you to say
what you just said one more time.

40:45.025 --> 40:47.278
Okay, Alan, you're on speaker phone.

40:47.361 --> 40:50.156
<i>Anna, Fortress is going to fund your loan.</i>

40:50.239 --> 40:51.240
<i>Congratulations.</i>

40:51.323 --> 40:53.659
I can't fucking believe it!

40:54.743 --> 40:56.954
ADF is coming your way, New York.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.999
Oh, my God, it's so, so great.

41:00.082 --> 41:02.334
I'm going to drink
so much champagne tonight.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.836
When will we have the money?

41:03.919 --> 41:06.839
So, there's just one thing left.
A small matter of due diligence.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.799
<i>Sometime next week,</i>

41:08.883 --> 41:11.302
<i>Fortress will send</i>
<i>an investigator in person</i>

41:11.385 --> 41:13.304
<i>to Germany to verify your assets.</i>

41:13.387 --> 41:15.806
<i>Speak with your father, with the bank.</i>

41:16.390 --> 41:18.309
Of course, it's just a formality.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.019
And then we will have the money.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.192
Uh…

41:28.027 --> 41:30.029
Okay, Alan, it's so good.

41:30.112 --> 41:32.698
Uh, let's, let's speak soon. Okay?

41:32.781 --> 41:35.201
Sounds good. Congratulations.

41:35.784 --> 41:36.660
Bye.

41:40.122 --> 41:41.040
Congrats.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.001
Thank you.

41:49.715 --> 41:50.799
Uh…

41:51.967 --> 41:54.261
I'm going for a walk.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.352
Fuck!

43:30.649 --> 43:32.443
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. You okay?

43:34.320 --> 43:36.947
I got, I got hit by the ball.

43:38.490 --> 43:40.618
Yeah, I noticed that. A-are you okay?

43:51.795 --> 43:52.671
God damn it.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.700
I… I wanted a chef…

44:23.577 --> 44:28.082
…to cook us
a special meal tonight to celebrate.

44:30.751 --> 44:31.669
Your loan?

44:31.752 --> 44:34.338
No, I'm not… I'm not taking the loan.

44:34.421 --> 44:35.881
I called my dad

44:35.964 --> 44:41.804
and he was, he was so impressed
how far I got with Fortress

44:41.887 --> 44:46.684
that he's advancing my trust to fund ADF.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.686
It is much better than a loan.

44:52.272 --> 44:53.190
That's great.

44:54.274 --> 44:55.484
Congratulations.

44:58.946 --> 44:59.822
Hmm.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.752
Let's go get dressed.

45:18.590 --> 45:19.925
I'm good. Thank you.

45:59.131 --> 46:00.132
Noah!

46:07.556 --> 46:08.932
I'm so glad to see you too.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.560
Everything's taken care of,
so now we can just relax--

46:11.643 --> 46:13.562
-We have to get out of here.
-What?

46:14.104 --> 46:15.063
What's going on?

46:15.564 --> 46:19.318
There is now a guard
stationed outside her door. And Anna…

46:20.319 --> 46:22.279
I don't know exactly
what's going on with her,

46:22.362 --> 46:23.447
but we need to leave.

46:23.947 --> 46:26.283
No, I'm sure once her cards get sorted,

46:26.366 --> 46:28.911
they'll take the guard away.
They'll feel so embarrassed--

46:28.994 --> 46:31.205
We don't know
when her cards will be sorted.

46:31.288 --> 46:32.331
It could take days.

46:32.915 --> 46:34.917
-We can't just leave her.
-Yes, we can.

46:36.001 --> 46:37.711
This is a bad situation.

46:44.092 --> 46:45.302
They have my <i>Vanity Fair</i> AmEx.

46:45.385 --> 46:48.263
Forget the AmEx.
You can get a new copy when you get home.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.391
You go pack our bags.
My stuff's mostly together already.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.684
I'll go get us a car.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.102
What do I say to Anna?

47:24.383 --> 47:25.676
Rachel.

47:25.759 --> 47:27.678
-Hey.
-Rachel.

47:33.600 --> 47:37.646
Did Noah tell you
my dad has given me money for ADF?

47:40.566 --> 47:41.859
He is? That's amazing.

47:41.942 --> 47:42.943
Hmm.

47:43.485 --> 47:45.779
It's so amazing.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.700
So tonight,

47:49.783 --> 47:55.664
we're going to have
the 20-course meal at the restaurant.

47:55.747 --> 48:00.002
We'll have lobster and caviar

48:00.085 --> 48:01.795
and champagne,

48:01.879 --> 48:05.924
and if they don't have what we want,

48:06.008 --> 48:09.136
then we could just helicopter it in.

48:10.345 --> 48:11.346
Hmm.

48:15.559 --> 48:16.518
Did your bank

48:17.686 --> 48:18.604
sort things out?

48:18.687 --> 48:19.897
Fuck my bank.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.232
They're so fucking incompetent.

48:23.734 --> 48:26.570
My dad will wire me
the money for the hotel,

48:26.653 --> 48:30.073
but I can't reach him
on the yacht for a couple days.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.492
But we'll be fine.

48:33.493 --> 48:34.661
Well, that's great.

48:48.717 --> 48:49.843
What are you doing?

48:59.227 --> 49:00.187
Um…

49:04.149 --> 49:07.527
Anna, I really
want to celebrate with you, but…

49:10.572 --> 49:11.823
I'm not feeling well.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.160
I think I might have
caught whatever Kacy had.

49:17.537 --> 49:19.706
Kacy had food poisoning.

49:21.333 --> 49:24.336
If you had what she had,
you would have already felt it.

49:28.173 --> 49:29.091
Yeah.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.635
Um, I don't know.

49:34.721 --> 49:37.891
Maybe it actually was a stomach bug.

49:40.102 --> 49:40.978
Rachel.

49:43.814 --> 49:44.690
Don't go.

49:52.114 --> 49:52.990
I'm sorry.

49:55.951 --> 49:56.827
I have to.

50:16.596 --> 50:19.016
Well, if you're

50:20.517 --> 50:21.601
gonna leave,

50:22.602 --> 50:28.483
these assholes need to take you
to the airport on a helicopter.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.235
They owe us at least that.

50:32.279 --> 50:33.488
Mm.

50:33.572 --> 50:34.489
Please.

50:35.323 --> 50:37.659
Rachel, I'll…
You know what, I'll call them.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.456
Hello?

50:43.749 --> 50:47.544
Can we use your helicopter?
We need to take someone to the airport.

50:51.631 --> 50:54.968
What do you mean you can't? We have to!

50:55.052 --> 50:56.011
I don't…

51:29.252 --> 51:30.837
-Oh, my God. Yeah.
-You okay?

51:32.297 --> 51:33.173
Are you?

51:49.940 --> 51:52.192
So how much longer
was Anna in Morocco for?

51:52.943 --> 51:55.070
Until I got
that phone call to fly her out,

51:55.153 --> 51:56.113
so another week.

51:57.572 --> 52:00.742
It does break my heart a little bit
thinking about her there all alone.

52:02.035 --> 52:04.538
At some point,
she realized she had no way out

52:04.621 --> 52:06.540
except to charge Rachel's credit cards.

52:06.623 --> 52:08.875
She put it all on my cards.

52:08.959 --> 52:11.086
The whole authentication data thing.

52:11.169 --> 52:13.964
La Mamounia didn't care.
They were trying to intimidate us.

52:14.047 --> 52:16.591
Because I switched them,
they had numbers for both cards.

52:16.675 --> 52:18.426
Whoa. Uh…

52:19.386 --> 52:22.097
Whoa, baby. So what happened?

52:22.681 --> 52:24.933
Kacy, she maxed out my personal card

52:25.642 --> 52:29.396
and then she charged my <i>Vanity Fair</i> card
before I could cancel it.

52:29.479 --> 52:31.648
$62,000 combined.

52:32.899 --> 52:34.109
Holy shit.

52:35.861 --> 52:36.736
Damn.

52:36.820 --> 52:37.821
Yeah.

52:37.904 --> 52:39.948
So other than your place that one night,

52:40.031 --> 52:42.242
do you know
where she was staying when she got back?

52:42.325 --> 52:43.994
I know where she tried to stay.

52:46.204 --> 52:47.581
Hello.

52:47.664 --> 52:50.208
Ms. Duke,
Ms. Delvey is here to see you again.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.923
<i>Anna waited in my lobby</i>
<i>for five hours.</i>

52:57.007 --> 52:59.384
<i>Five long hours.</i>

53:00.010 --> 53:02.470
<i>And I came close to cracking.</i>
<i>Several times.</i>

53:02.554 --> 53:04.014
<i>But Rachel wouldn't let me.</i>

53:04.931 --> 53:06.600
<i>She's downstairs right now.</i>

53:06.683 --> 53:08.810
Rachel, she said she'll wait.

53:08.894 --> 53:10.395
The bitch is waiting me out.

53:10.478 --> 53:11.938
Then you wait her out.

53:12.022 --> 53:13.148
You can't let her win.

53:13.231 --> 53:14.357
I don't know.

53:14.983 --> 53:18.361
What if I run out of food?
She could be down there for a long time.

53:18.445 --> 53:20.864
Kacy, you can do this.

53:21.573 --> 53:22.449
You know why?

53:23.116 --> 53:24.075
No.

53:24.576 --> 53:28.205
Because you are a bad bitch.

53:28.705 --> 53:31.458
Oh, my God, Rachel. This is serious shit.

53:31.541 --> 53:34.127
Exactly. Which is why I want to hear you.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.629
Tell me you're a bad bitch.

53:37.672 --> 53:38.798
I'm a bad bitch.

53:39.841 --> 53:41.426
I want to hear you louder.

53:42.219 --> 53:43.136
Kacy!

53:44.304 --> 53:45.597
I'm a bad bitch.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.598
Louder!

53:47.182 --> 53:49.434
I'm a bad fucking bitch!

53:52.771 --> 53:55.023
<i>You know, call it the universe,</i>

53:55.815 --> 53:57.651
call it whatever you want,

53:57.734 --> 53:58.818
but it had my back.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.613
It got me out of Morocco,

54:03.114 --> 54:04.783
and it found me a real friend.

54:05.992 --> 54:07.452
Rachel's a good person.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.580
Ooh. Pellegrino.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.087
Can I pour you some?

54:20.131 --> 54:21.216
Please.

54:21.299 --> 54:23.218
Please, Rachel abandoned Anna.

54:24.010 --> 54:25.470
Kicked her when she was down,

54:25.553 --> 54:27.681
and left her alone
in some foreign country.

54:27.764 --> 54:30.809
Rachel's happy to call herself
Anna's friend when it meant free shit,

54:30.892 --> 54:33.603
trips to Morocco,
but as soon as times got tough…

54:38.149 --> 54:39.150
Some friend.

54:40.068 --> 54:42.153
But does a friend

54:42.237 --> 54:45.156
charge another friend's
credit card without permission?

54:45.240 --> 54:47.450
So you still haven't interviewed Rachel?

54:48.159 --> 54:49.160
Why do you say that?

54:49.244 --> 54:51.705
You'd see. I wasn't there, but I know.

54:52.455 --> 54:54.541
Rachel offered her card.

54:55.208 --> 54:56.960
That's how Rachel was.

54:57.043 --> 55:00.130
She liked to show
she could keep up. She offered.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.341
That takes a certain kind of…

55:05.677 --> 55:06.511
whatever.

55:06.594 --> 55:09.139
I don't ever assume
someone else is picking up my check.

55:09.222 --> 55:12.058
I always assume
a bill's coming due. That's life.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.936
Nothing's free.
So I don't feel sorry for her.

55:15.020 --> 55:17.439
She went on the trip, and she offered.

55:18.189 --> 55:19.983
Don't offer if you don't want to pay.

55:23.486 --> 55:25.322
<i>I mean, it might just be more ideal</i>

55:25.405 --> 55:28.450
to get two adjoining suites,
so everyone has their space.

55:29.576 --> 55:31.745
The four-course menu
might not be enough food.

55:31.828 --> 55:33.163
Should we maybe do the six?

55:33.246 --> 55:35.665
-Is this zellige tile?
-Very good.

55:54.934 --> 55:56.603
<i>Rachel, Vivian Kent.</i>

55:56.686 --> 55:59.647
<i>As I said before,</i>
<i>I would love to speak with you</i>

55:59.731 --> 56:01.900
about Morocco and the charges.

56:01.983 --> 56:04.569
Rachel, I know
it might be hard to talk about,

56:04.652 --> 56:08.365
but if Anna did what you say she did,
I want to tell your side of the story.

56:08.448 --> 56:10.575
<i>The Morocco story</i>
<i>is essential to my article,</i>

56:10.658 --> 56:12.911
and I'd hate to write about it
without your perspective.

56:12.994 --> 56:14.120
You and Anna were friends…

56:14.204 --> 56:17.874
Rachel, Vivian again.
I would really love your take

56:17.957 --> 56:19.751
<i>on what happened in Morocco with Anna.</i>

56:19.834 --> 56:21.878
I've spoken to some people about the trip

56:21.961 --> 56:24.923
and I really just need
to fact-check some essential details.

56:25.006 --> 56:26.007
<i>Can you please…</i>

56:26.091 --> 56:27.050
Call me back.

56:27.133 --> 56:28.343
Give me a call back.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.594
Return my call.

56:29.677 --> 56:30.512
Please.
