Oh, no. Is this gonna

02:11.256 --> 02:13.174
be "shoe store" bad

or "circus" bad?

I think it's gonna be

"ten-items-or-less aisle" bad.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.179

You put up a little sign

02:18.221 --> 02:20.766
that nobody can read,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.977
and that gives you

02:20.808 --> 02:22.977
the right to steal?!

02:23.018 --> 02:25.270
Where is the manager?!

02:25.312 --> 02:28.231

Don't you give

02:28.273 --> 02:29.775
me that look.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.934

03:03.976 --> 03:06.145
I think I might actually

03:03.976 --> 03:06.145
have a chance with her.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.522
For some reason,

03:06.185 --> 03:08.522
no one ever asks her out.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.231
Maybe she's so promiscuous

03:10.273 --> 03:12.233
she intimidates

03:10.273 --> 03:12.233
all the other guys.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.153
Yeah, I'm going with that.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.030
Hello, Malcolm.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.030
Hi, Angela.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.032
I'm glad I caught up to you.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.032
I was thinking...

03:18.073 --> 03:19.741
You want to ask me out,

03:18.073 --> 03:19.741
don't you?

03:19.783 --> 03:21.827
Well, I was planning to mutter

03:19.783 --> 03:21.827
and stumble around

03:21.869 --> 03:24.496
for a few minutes first,

03:21.869 --> 03:24.496
but yes.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.747
You want to go

03:24.538 --> 03:25.747
to the Spring Dance?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.166
Let me save you

03:25.789 --> 03:27.166
the trouble.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.625
You don't want

03:27.206 --> 03:28.625
to go out with me

03:28.667 --> 03:30.878
because, before you

03:28.667 --> 03:30.878
do go out with me,

03:30.919 --> 03:33.630
my family would have to

03:30.919 --> 03:33.630
approve, which they won't do

03:33.672 --> 03:36.424
without giving you

03:33.672 --> 03:36.424
a gigantic third degree.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.259
So why don't you

03:36.466 --> 03:38.259
just give up now,

03:38.301 --> 03:40.095
and let me get on

03:38.301 --> 03:40.095
with dying alone.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.097
You're worried

03:40.137 --> 03:42.097
about your family?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.974
That's not going

03:42.139 --> 03:43.974
to bother me.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.974
Oh, yeah?

03:44.016 --> 03:48.269
My family is unbelievably

03:44.016 --> 03:48.269
intrusive, overbearing,

03:48.311 --> 03:50.105
controlling

03:48.311 --> 03:50.105
and humiliating.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.150
You are talking

03:50.147 --> 03:53.150
to the right guy.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.275

03:57.320 --> 03:59.489

03:57.320 --> 03:59.489
Thank you so much

03:57.320 --> 03:59.489
for this opportunity, sir.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.242
Sure.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.242
Will you excuse us?

04:03.326 --> 04:05.204
I don't need

04:03.326 --> 04:05.204
an assistant.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.454
But the boy needs a job,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.707
and I've filled every

04:06.496 --> 04:08.707
other position here

04:08.749 --> 04:10.751
two times over.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.751
Oh, please?

04:10.792 --> 04:14.922
Francis, I'm sure you can find

04:10.792 --> 04:14.922
something for him to do.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.339
Okay, I'll try.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.883
Thank you, Francis.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.385
I know I have a problem

04:17.925 --> 04:20.385
hiring too many people,

04:20.427 --> 04:21.762
but I'm getting help.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.181
I am seeing three

04:21.803 --> 04:24.181
psychiatrists about it.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.934
I'm starting to forget

04:26.975 --> 04:28.769
what Luigi's pizza

04:26.975 --> 04:28.769
even tasted like.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.105
(phone ringing)

04:28.810 --> 04:31.105
I told you not

04:28.810 --> 04:31.105
to brush your teeth.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.314
Hello.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.193
Yes, it is.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.320
Really? Really?!

04:39.362 --> 04:41.740
Yes! Boys! Boys!

04:41.782 --> 04:43.324
It's the owner

04:41.782 --> 04:43.324
of Luigi's calling

04:43.366 --> 04:45.035
to apologize to your mother.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.578
Get your jackets.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.038

The pizza gods have

04:48.080 --> 04:50.331
answered our prayers.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.751
Hello.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.170
Hi. This is Lawrence Camprisi,

04:52.793 --> 04:55.170
the owner of Luigi's.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.546
I heard about what happened,

04:56.588 --> 04:59.216
and I wanted to call personally

04:56.588 --> 04:59.216
to apologize.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.219
Oh? What exactly

04:59.258 --> 05:02.219
are you apologizing for?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.556
About the way that

05:04.387 --> 05:06.556
you were treated last Thursday.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.058
There's no excuse for it,

05:08.100 --> 05:09.517
and I couldn't feel

05:08.100 --> 05:09.517
more terrible about it.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.561
Well, that's

05:09.559 --> 05:11.561
very nice to hear.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.439
I  am  curious

05:12.896 --> 05:14.439
why it took two weeks

05:14.481 --> 05:16.399
to get an apology.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.069
I'm sorry,

05:19.111 --> 05:20.612
but, you see,

05:19.111 --> 05:20.612
I just got in from Europe,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.030
and I haven't even unpacked yet.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.824
The point is that

05:22.072 --> 05:23.824
you and your family

05:23.865 --> 05:25.284
are valuable customers,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.368
and we really want

05:25.325 --> 05:27.368
to get you back in here.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.580
Well, I must say,

05:27.410 --> 05:30.580
this apology has surpassed

05:30.622 --> 05:32.874
my expectations.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.295
So what kind of refund

05:32.916 --> 05:36.295
are you giving us?

05:36.335 --> 05:37.671
What?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.006
I figure we overpaid

05:39.047 --> 05:41.175
at least $300

05:39.047 --> 05:41.175
over the years.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.383
Do you want to send us a check

05:42.425 --> 05:43.844
or some kind

05:42.425 --> 05:43.844
of gift certificate?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.304
Lady, we can't

05:43.885 --> 05:45.304
give you a refund.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.014
We don't have

05:45.344 --> 05:47.014
those kind of margins.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.849
If you can afford to pay

05:47.055 --> 05:48.849
for a trip to Europe,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.391
you can afford 1/20th of that

05:50.433 --> 05:52.769
to make things right

05:50.433 --> 05:52.769
with a customer you cheated.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.604
There is no pizza god.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.398
Well, then I doubt you care,

05:54.646 --> 05:57.398
but we are never, ever

05:57.440 --> 06:00.902
eating a Luigi's

05:57.440 --> 06:00.902
pizza again.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.489
At least we have closure.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.867
Okay, you asked for it.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.910
Don't say

06:06.908 --> 06:08.910
I didn't warn you.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.537
Look, I'm fine. I...

06:14.875 --> 06:16.417
This is my mom, my dad,

06:16.459 --> 06:19.420
my nana, Aunt Layla,

06:16.459 --> 06:19.420
Aunt Svidmella, Uncle Zach,

06:19.462 --> 06:20.588
Nick, Max and Alexandra.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.007
The rest are in the den.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.717
This is Malcolm.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.845
Welcome. Sit. Sit.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.610
So... you want

06:39.316 --> 06:42.610
to marry my daughter?

06:42.652 --> 06:43.444
What?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.405
(laughter)

06:47.908 --> 06:49.701
I couldn't resist.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.495
I'm sorry to put you

06:50.869 --> 06:52.495
through all this,

06:52.537 --> 06:55.290
but our family

06:52.537 --> 06:55.290
is very protective

06:55.332 --> 06:56.624
of our little Angela.

06:56.666 --> 06:57.709
We need to know

06:57.751 --> 06:59.586
what kind of boy you are.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.969
Well, uh... I'm just normal.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.846
I go to Angela's school.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.556
I get good grades.

07:11.598 --> 07:15.435
Uh, I have a job three days a

07:11.598 --> 07:15.435
week at a drugstore with my mom.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.483
Um... never had a cavity.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.615
Did have all my shots.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.869
Religiously, I guess

07:30.533 --> 07:32.869
I would classify myself

07:32.911 --> 07:34.495
as a hopeful agnostic.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.581
I think the basic

07:34.537 --> 07:36.581
philosophical question is...

07:36.623 --> 07:38.792
Can we stop this?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.792
Look, he's a genius.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.170
He's the smartest kid in our

07:38.833 --> 07:42.170
whole school by, like, a lot.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.423
Really?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.133
Genius?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.385
Say something smart.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.891
Well, um, I'm doing a paper

07:51.388 --> 07:54.891
on cosmological inflation.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.517
It's a theory that says

07:56.559 --> 07:58.561
the reason the universe

07:56.559 --> 07:58.561
is so homogeneous

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
is that right after

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
the Big Bang,

08:00.605 --> 08:01.815
there was a short period

08:01.856 --> 08:04.525
of even more rapid growth

08:01.856 --> 08:04.525
than usual.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.364
I hope you mentioned the

08:06.569 --> 08:09.364
importance of scalar fields

08:09.406 --> 08:11.532
to the whole concept

08:09.406 --> 08:11.532
of symmetry breaking.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.410
Not to brag,

08:13.452 --> 08:15.329
but I did some pretty

08:13.452 --> 08:15.329
important work on this.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.789
Oh, please. Until they actually

08:15.370 --> 08:17.789
find a Higgs particle,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.458
it's all just

08:17.831 --> 08:19.458
empty speculation.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.043
Yes, dear. Women.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.545
I'm okay with him.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.545
You okay with him?

08:24.587 --> 08:25.546
Nana?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.007
Eh.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.633
She loves you!

08:28.675 --> 08:32.387
Come on! We're going to see

08:28.675 --> 08:32.387
how much a boy your age can eat.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.930
And there'll be singing!

08:33.972 --> 08:35.474
And I have to warn you,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.268
we're big Botticelli

08:35.515 --> 08:38.268
players in this family.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.978
How's your

08:38.310 --> 08:39.978
medieval history?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.438
Okay, I guess.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.025
Malcolm's on my team!

08:46.193 --> 08:47.777
One sugar, just

08:46.193 --> 08:47.777
the way you like.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.529
Thank you, Jordan.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.491
Francis?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.491
What, honey?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.451
I just got off the phone

08:52.532 --> 08:54.451
with my mother.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.077
She sounded really upset

08:54.493 --> 08:56.077
that you didn't

08:56.119 --> 08:57.662
send a "thank you" note

08:56.119 --> 08:57.662
for Christmas.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.580
I mailed it

08:57.704 --> 08:59.580
yesterday, sir.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.041
You sent

08:59.622 --> 09:01.041
a tasteful card

09:01.082 --> 09:03.251
with a pressed

09:01.082 --> 09:03.251
wildflower inside.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.586
I think you owe

09:03.293 --> 09:05.586
someone an apology.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.964
He's good.

09:08.006 --> 09:08.965
(sniffles)

09:09.007 --> 09:10.550
Allow me, sir.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.594
(blows)

09:13.636 --> 09:16.097
LOIS:

09:13.636 --> 09:16.097
Hal, boys, dinner!

09:20.227 --> 09:21.478
What's this?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.481
It's Family Fiesta Night!

09:28.818 --> 09:31.405
I went to Mariachi's.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.032
I got four kinds of enchiladas,

09:31.446 --> 09:34.032
steak and chicken tacos,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.658
and a tray of empanadas.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.160
Malcolm!

09:38.661 --> 09:41.248
No, no, are you kidding?

09:38.661 --> 09:41.248
I had a great time.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.624
Wednesday? Yeah, absolutely.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.460
All right, bye.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.504
Who was that?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.504
Angela's dad.

09:47.546 --> 09:48.922
What's going on?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.842
(Mexican music playing)

09:52.884 --> 09:54.844
Isn't this fun?!

10:00.683 --> 10:02.477
(turns off music)

10:05.730 --> 10:07.274
You're right.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.816
We don't need music.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.485
We have chips.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.446
And the important thing

10:10.527 --> 10:12.446
is that we're

10:12.487 --> 10:15.407
all together enjoying

10:12.487 --> 10:15.407
some family time.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.534
So let's talk.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.952
Who's got a good story?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.703
Well, today, my

10:18.993 --> 10:20.703
mom lost her mind.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.163
(whispers):

10:20.745 --> 10:22.163
Reese.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.873
Look, I went

10:22.205 --> 10:23.873
to a lot of trouble here,

10:23.915 --> 10:26.334
and I know you boys like

10:23.915 --> 10:26.334
this stuff, so...

10:26.376 --> 10:28.169
what's the problem?

10:28.211 --> 10:30.380
Mom, any way you dress it up,

10:28.211 --> 10:30.380
it's not Luigi's.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.673
Luigi's pizza wasn't the point.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.050
The food is not what matters.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.676
What matters is

10:34.092 --> 10:35.676
that we're

10:35.718 --> 10:38.263
sitting here together

10:35.718 --> 10:38.263
enjoying each other's company.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.974
If you believe that, then why'd

10:38.305 --> 10:40.974
you buy all the Mexican food?

10:41.015 --> 10:44.352
Fine! Mexican food

10:41.015 --> 10:44.352
goes in the trash!

10:47.606 --> 10:49.649
Olé.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.325
No, I am not Copernicus.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.325
(laughter)

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
MARIA:

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
Did you isolate

10:59.742 --> 11:02.162
something which

10:59.742 --> 11:02.162
eventually killed you?

11:02.203 --> 11:04.080
No, I am not Madame Curie.

11:04.122 --> 11:04.914
(whooping)

11:04.956 --> 11:07.501
This is so cool.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.918
When we play at my house,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.753
we can only use

11:08.960 --> 11:10.753
cartoon characters.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.423
Cartoon characters

11:10.795 --> 11:13.423
we saw that day.

11:13.465 --> 11:18.719
Okay, do you believe

11:13.465 --> 11:18.719
in life after love?

11:18.761 --> 11:20.721
No, I am not Cher.

11:20.763 --> 11:21.722
(laughter)

11:21.764 --> 11:23.642
We'll never beat him!

11:24.643 --> 11:25.393
You baked brownies?

11:25.435 --> 11:26.311
With walnuts.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.354
Your favorite.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.606
(oohing)

11:29.648 --> 11:31.232
You made this for me?

11:32.775 --> 11:34.402
This is awesome.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.405
This is so much fun.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.032
I love dating Angela.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.659
Where is Angela?

11:40.699 --> 11:43.744
She went over to a girlfriend's

11:40.699 --> 11:43.744
house an hour ago.

11:43.786 --> 11:44.787
Oh.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.998
Okay. (chuckles)

11:48.791 --> 11:50.627
(whispering): Are the

11:48.791 --> 11:50.627
smaller ones better, sir?

11:50.669 --> 11:52.128
Very much, thank you.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.006
I don't have to open

11:52.170 --> 11:55.006
my mouth as far.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
What were

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
you saying, Mom?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.925
LOIS:

11:56.424 --> 11:57.925
They have been tacking on

11:57.967 --> 12:00.053
this 15% service charge

11:57.967 --> 12:00.053
for the last three years.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.846
I mean, I'm doing

12:00.094 --> 12:01.846
the right thing

12:01.888 --> 12:03.973
by boycotting them,

12:01.888 --> 12:03.973
don't you think?

12:04.015 --> 12:06.059
I don't know, it sounds like

12:04.015 --> 12:06.059
you're making everyone else

12:06.100 --> 12:07.810
suffer for something

12:06.100 --> 12:07.810
only you care about.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.021
I don't know why I bother

12:07.852 --> 12:10.021
to talking to you, Francis.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.482
Would it kill you to say

12:10.063 --> 12:12.482
something supportive to me

12:12.524 --> 12:13.774
when I'm obviously right?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.485
You're blaming me?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.485
You know what..

12:16.653 --> 12:17.778
If you were so certain

12:16.653 --> 12:17.778
you were right,

12:17.820 --> 12:19.780
you wouldn't be coming

12:17.820 --> 12:19.780
to me for reassurance.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.658
If you were so certain

12:19.822 --> 12:21.658
you were right,

12:21.700 --> 12:24.411
you wouldn't be coming

12:21.700 --> 12:24.411
to me for reassurance.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
I think we got her, sir.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.584
Let's not dwell

12:28.831 --> 12:30.584
on our victories, Jordan.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.752
My ears are feeling

12:30.625 --> 12:33.752
hairy again.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.092
I thought I would never

12:36.673 --> 12:39.092
smell that smell again.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.801
Your mother's not

12:39.133 --> 12:40.801
coming home for two hours.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.303
That should give us

12:40.843 --> 12:42.303
plenty of time

12:42.345 --> 12:43.804
to eat it

12:42.345 --> 12:43.804
and destroy all the evidence.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.306
But I want to be clear

12:43.846 --> 12:45.306
on this.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.892
What we are doing here

12:45.348 --> 12:47.892
is not okay.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.020
It is morally reprehensible

12:47.934 --> 12:51.020
on every level.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.022
We should be ashamed.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.191
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

12:53.064 --> 12:55.191
we hate ourselves.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.735
Now, remember, boys,

12:55.233 --> 12:56.735
whatever happens,

12:56.775 --> 12:58.445
we are all in this together.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.487
Where's Malcolm?

12:59.529 --> 13:00.614
He's at his other family.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.282
More for us.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.284
(moaning)

13:04.325 --> 13:07.662
I can't believe

13:04.325 --> 13:07.662
how much we ate.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.707
I can't believe

13:07.704 --> 13:10.707
how good it tasted.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.833
That was the taste of evil, son.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.920
Gooey, delicious evil.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.631
I know I've got

13:17.672 --> 13:19.674
to cover my breath,

13:17.672 --> 13:19.674
but the thought of even eating

13:19.716 --> 13:21.842
this breath mint just

13:19.716 --> 13:21.842
makes me want to throw up.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.094
We forced ours down.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.096
LOIS:

13:23.136 --> 13:25.096
Hey, everybody!

13:25.138 --> 13:28.308
I got dinner!

13:29.392 --> 13:30.310
It's from

13:29.392 --> 13:30.310
the Pizza Connection.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.519
I had to drive

13:31.561 --> 13:33.062
all the way across town

13:31.561 --> 13:33.062
to get it,

13:33.104 --> 13:35.440
but I figured I owe you boys

13:33.104 --> 13:35.440
something nice.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.858
I know how hard it's been going

13:35.482 --> 13:37.858
without Luigi's,

13:37.900 --> 13:40.737
and it means a lot to me

13:37.900 --> 13:40.737
that you're backing me up.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.951
LOIS:

13:45.700 --> 13:46.951
There's cheese

13:46.993 --> 13:49.162
inside the meatballs.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.250
I never saw people

13:51.914 --> 13:54.250
get so passionate about

13:54.292 --> 13:56.670
the Copenhagen interpretation

13:54.292 --> 13:56.670
of quantum theory.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.254
I thought Nana was going

13:56.711 --> 13:58.254
to punch somebody.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.880
We had so much

13:58.296 --> 13:59.880
fun last night.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.049
I watched...

14:02.091 --> 14:04.093
Dad torch...

14:04.135 --> 14:06.721
his wedding album.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.556
Hey, Malcolm.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.474
Hey, Sarah.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.891
I just wanted to ask

14:10.933 --> 14:12.185
if you want to go

14:10.933 --> 14:12.185
to the Spring Dance with me.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.269
I know it's kind of late.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.895
Oh wow, I'd love to.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.148
Great, so I'll see you Friday?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.148
See you on Friday.

14:17.856 --> 14:18.775
Isn't it great

14:18.817 --> 14:20.901
when the girl

14:18.817 --> 14:20.901
asks the...

14:20.943 --> 14:22.320
Angela.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.904
I totally forgot.

14:23.946 --> 14:27.283
Oh, man, I've got two dates

14:23.946 --> 14:27.283
to the Spring Dance.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.828
It's sort of like

14:27.325 --> 14:29.828
that old episode of...

14:29.869 --> 14:31.412
well, every show.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.913
If you think about it,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.123
it's actually a pretty

14:32.955 --> 14:34.123
interesting challenge.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.709
I mean, Urkel did

14:34.165 --> 14:35.709
pretty well

14:35.750 --> 14:37.502
with the identical

14:35.750 --> 14:37.502
cousin trick

14:37.544 --> 14:39.295
until he got greedy

14:37.544 --> 14:39.295
and made himself a duke.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.589
And Potsie doesn't count

14:39.337 --> 14:41.589
because one of his turned out

14:41.631 --> 14:42.923
to be a dude.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.009
Stevie, are you even

14:42.965 --> 14:45.009
listening to me?

14:45.051 --> 14:46.594
Two girls...

14:47.428 --> 14:49.138
...two families.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.724
I don't have...

14:50.765 --> 14:51.932
two lungs!

14:51.974 --> 14:53.810
What does that

14:51.974 --> 14:53.810
have to do with...

14:53.852 --> 14:55.228
People with... your luck...

14:55.269 --> 14:58.231
aren't allowed... to be creeps.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.318
Just choose!

15:02.360 --> 15:04.945
Yeah, all right.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.953
Okay, it's 7:35.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.955
It's a five-minute

15:12.995 --> 15:14.955
bike ride to Luigi's.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.457
It'll take you one minute

15:14.997 --> 15:16.457
to order the pizza,

15:16.499 --> 15:17.958
which means they should

15:16.499 --> 15:17.958
hand it to you

15:18.000 --> 15:19.419
at 7:56.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.045
I'll send your mother

15:19.460 --> 15:21.045
to the mall at 7:50

15:21.087 --> 15:23.256
and we'll destroy the evidence

15:21.087 --> 15:23.256
before she gets back.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.799
You know, we're going

15:23.297 --> 15:24.799
to pay for this.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.133
We're going to pay big.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.552
Yeah.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.554
But we're not

15:27.594 --> 15:29.554
going to pay today.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.138
Whatever else

15:29.596 --> 15:31.138
it's done to me,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.224
this whole conspiracy has made

15:31.180 --> 15:33.224
me feel so close to my boys.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.768
Except for

15:33.266 --> 15:34.768
Malcolm and Jamie.

15:34.809 --> 15:35.976
They're not like us.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.270
Now go!

15:43.902 --> 15:45.779
Hey, honey.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.779
What are you doing?

15:45.820 --> 15:46.905
Are those car keys?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.239
I'm going down to Luigi's.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.490
What?

15:49.532 --> 15:50.991
Why would you do that?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.493
I'm giving up.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.994
I've inflicted this thing

15:52.535 --> 15:53.994
on all of you long enough.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.037
I'm going to go down there,

15:55.079 --> 15:56.581
I'm going to walk up

15:55.079 --> 15:56.581
to the counter,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.708
and I'm going to do right

15:56.623 --> 15:58.708
by my family.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.795
Over my dead body.

16:01.836 --> 16:02.629
What?

16:02.670 --> 16:04.004
You can't give up now.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.882
I thought we were

16:04.046 --> 16:05.882
a team on this.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.592
Hal, you've all been

16:05.924 --> 16:07.592
wonderfully supportive,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.009
but maybe enough is enough.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.470
The woman that I love

16:10.511 --> 16:12.054
has never thought

16:10.511 --> 16:12.054
that enough was enough.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.098
The woman that I love

16:12.096 --> 16:14.098
is not going to go

16:14.140 --> 16:16.183
anywhere near that place

16:14.140 --> 16:16.183
in the next hour.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.018
We believe in you, Lois.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.020
You have got to fight this.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.649
Thank you.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.858
You're right.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.235
I will.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.323
Malcolm!

16:30.364 --> 16:31.741
Come in. Come in.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.117
Look who's here!

16:33.159 --> 16:35.202
Angela, your boyfriend is here!

16:35.244 --> 16:38.456
I put the leaf

16:35.244 --> 16:38.456
back in the table.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.667
We can reenact

16:38.498 --> 16:40.667
the battle of Lepanto

16:40.708 --> 16:42.042
with olives and celery!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.210
I can't stay.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.045
IVAN:

16:43.252 --> 16:45.045
On Saturday,

16:45.087 --> 16:46.464
you and Angela must join us.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.257
The Taiwan acrobats

16:46.506 --> 16:48.257
are in town.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.301
I don't think I can make it.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.971
Well, you and Angela can

16:50.343 --> 16:52.971
join us for movie night.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.055
And I won't take

16:53.012 --> 16:55.055
"no" for an answer.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.683
I can't.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.477
Why not? What's wrong?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.145
He's breaking up with me.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.523
Which I'm totally okay with.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.316
We haven't even talked

17:03.564 --> 17:05.316
in two weeks.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.193
What were you saying?

17:05.358 --> 17:07.193
Oh, no, it's nothing.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.865
You're breaking up?

17:11.906 --> 17:13.157
Just like that?

17:13.199 --> 17:14.868
Yeah.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.285
This is really hard.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.705
My life is kind of complicated

17:18.746 --> 17:20.080
right now, and I just

17:20.122 --> 17:21.374
need my space.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.918
But I really want us

17:21.415 --> 17:23.918
to stay friends.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.753
"Friends."

17:26.796 --> 17:28.172
It's not you. It's me.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.507
The past few weeks

17:29.549 --> 17:30.717
have been

17:29.549 --> 17:30.717
great, but...

17:30.758 --> 17:32.092
Please. Don't.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.722
No, really.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.516
You know how amazing

17:35.763 --> 17:38.516
you guys are?

17:38.558 --> 17:39.976
Look, Angela's

17:38.558 --> 17:39.976
going to date

17:40.018 --> 17:41.101
a lot of guys...

17:41.143 --> 17:42.562
that are much better

17:41.143 --> 17:42.562
than me and...

17:42.603 --> 17:45.272
Now you're

17:42.603 --> 17:45.272
being patronizing.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.066
Just go.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.326
I'll see you around?

17:57.368 --> 18:01.789
We both know

17:57.368 --> 18:01.789
that's not how it works.

18:07.754 --> 18:11.049
This butter is just sitting here

18:07.754 --> 18:11.049
like a cube on my toast.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.508
It's not...

18:12.550 --> 18:14.802
doing that thing

18:12.550 --> 18:14.802
that Jordan does.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.136
Spreading?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.430
Yeah!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.139
Francis, this

18:17.471 --> 18:19.139
has to stop.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.225
I liked the flowers

18:19.181 --> 18:21.225
you had Jordan send me,

18:21.267 --> 18:23.143
and the poem he wrote

18:21.267 --> 18:23.143
was very sweet,

18:23.185 --> 18:24.729
but you're

18:23.185 --> 18:24.729
turning into

18:24.771 --> 18:25.980
a helpless infant.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.314
If Jordan hadn't

18:26.022 --> 18:27.314
wandered in on you

18:27.356 --> 18:28.733
in the men's room yesterday,

18:28.775 --> 18:30.317
you'd still be

18:28.775 --> 18:30.317
stuck in there.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.237
I would've figured it out.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.322
No, I wouldn't have.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.533
You're right.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.533
I'll let him go.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.368
It's for the best.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.289
Jordan, there's something

18:40.870 --> 18:43.289
I have to talk to you about.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.165
The thing is...

18:45.207 --> 18:46.375
You need to let me go.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.168
Well, yeah, and...

18:48.210 --> 18:50.755
You feel terrible about this,

18:48.210 --> 18:50.755
but you can't keep me,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.673
even though I've done

18:50.797 --> 18:52.673
an outstanding job.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.174
Yeah, I'm...

18:54.216 --> 18:56.176
Sorry. Of course you are.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.176
But you've written me

18:56.218 --> 18:57.344
a wonderful letter

18:56.218 --> 18:57.344
of recommendation.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.097
And let me thank

18:57.386 --> 18:59.097
you in advance

18:59.138 --> 19:00.473
for the muffin basket

18:59.138 --> 19:00.473
you'll be sending.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.682
It's not too expensive,

19:01.724 --> 19:02.600
but I will appreciate

19:01.724 --> 19:02.600
the thought.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.018
Good-bye, sir.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.355
Good-bye.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.483
It's best to squeeze

19:08.397 --> 19:10.483
now, sir.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.862
Come on. Come on. Sit down.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.196
Too bad Malcolm's

19:14.904 --> 19:16.196
at the dance.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.573
He's going

19:16.238 --> 19:17.573
to miss this.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.573
What is it?

19:17.615 --> 19:19.199
I was ready to give up

19:17.615 --> 19:19.199
on my war

19:19.241 --> 19:21.661
with Luigi's, and then

19:19.241 --> 19:21.661
your father inspired me

19:21.702 --> 19:23.121
to take action.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.664
So yesterday, I called

19:23.162 --> 19:24.664
Clyde on Your Side.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.582
Who?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.582
You know, that consumer guy

19:26.624 --> 19:27.875
on Channel 5.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.837
They're doing

19:27.917 --> 19:30.837
a whole exposé on Luigi's.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.213
They told me it was going

19:30.878 --> 19:33.213
to be on at 10:23.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.214
Oh, here it is.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.466
This may look like a friendly,

19:35.508 --> 19:36.717
neighborhood pizza parlor,

19:36.759 --> 19:38.636
but thanks

19:36.759 --> 19:38.636
to an alert tipster,

19:38.678 --> 19:40.721
we discovered

19:38.678 --> 19:40.721
that this hangout

19:40.763 --> 19:42.890
could be hanging you out

19:40.763 --> 19:42.890
to dry.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.143
Alert tipster, that's me.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.477
It turns out this eatery

19:46.519 --> 19:49.229
adds a secret 15% service charge

19:46.519 --> 19:49.229
to every tab.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.231
I want to be clear

19:49.271 --> 19:51.231
this does not reflect

19:51.273 --> 19:53.233
on the Italian people,

19:53.275 --> 19:56.403
most of whom are hard-working

19:53.275 --> 19:56.403
decent Americans.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.864
But for the cadre of tricksters

19:57.905 --> 20:01.117
here at Luigi's,

19:57.905 --> 20:01.117
we've got a tip for you:

20:01.159 --> 20:03.828
clean up-a you act.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.039
Who are the victims

20:03.870 --> 20:06.039
in this scam?

20:06.080 --> 20:08.332
Senior citizens

20:06.080 --> 20:08.332
on a fixed income.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.250
Local teens after a dance.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.087
And of course,

20:10.292 --> 20:13.087
the biggest price is paid...

20:13.129 --> 20:14.547
Oh, my God!

20:15.297 --> 20:16.883
That traitor!

20:16.924 --> 20:18.926
How could he betray

20:16.924 --> 20:18.926
the trust of this family?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.260
Especially you, Lois.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.138
Doesn't he know what

20:20.302 --> 20:22.138
you've been fighting for?

20:22.180 --> 20:23.639
REESE: Yeah!

20:22.180 --> 20:23.639
That betrayer!

20:23.681 --> 20:24.974
Look at him shove

20:23.681 --> 20:24.974
that pizza in his mouth

20:25.016 --> 20:26.433
right there in

20:25.016 --> 20:26.433
the restaurant

20:26.475 --> 20:28.268
when we have to sneak

20:26.475 --> 20:28.268
ours in the garage!

20:28.310 --> 20:29.687
What?!

20:29.729 --> 20:31.271
This isn't

20:29.729 --> 20:31.271
just the sad story of...

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
All right,

20:33.315 --> 20:35.943
I was saving this

20:33.315 --> 20:35.943
until I needed it.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.863
Dad does a five-minute imitation

20:35.985 --> 20:38.863
of you on the toilet.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.906
I'll show you

20:38.905 --> 20:39.906
the videotape

20:39.947 --> 20:41.741
if you're willing to deal.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.452
(knocks)

20:45.494 --> 20:48.081
Turns out, breaking up with

20:45.494 --> 20:48.081
Angela was a terrible mistake.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.289
It's sad.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
Sometimes you don't realize

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
what you had

20:51.333 --> 20:53.252
until you throw it away.

20:54.837 --> 20:55.796
Malcolm.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.006
Hey.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.716
What are you

20:57.048 --> 20:58.716
doing here?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.802
I was just in the neighborhood

20:58.758 --> 21:01.802
and I was thinking maybe...

21:02.511 --> 21:04.388
You guys look great.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.891
This is really awkward.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.310
(laughter)

21:10.352 --> 21:12.605
STEVIE: Yes...

21:10.352 --> 21:12.605
I'm the Earl...

21:12.646 --> 21:14.523
of Sandwich.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.275
(cheering)
