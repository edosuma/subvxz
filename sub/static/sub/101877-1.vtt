WEBVTT

01:14.141 --> 01:15.175
Sanders.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.681
Yeah. What's the address?

05:20.988 --> 05:25.059
I've known they approved you
for active duty for a day or so.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.929
Couldn't say anything.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.901
Look, Riley.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.673
Not everyone comes back
from something like that.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.511
I'm fine, sir.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.583
Abducted, tortured?

05:54.989 --> 05:56.891
Are you willing?
Are you...

06:05.032 --> 06:07.568
I'm just acknowledging that.

06:08.970 --> 06:10.605
Okay.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.176
Anyway, you have a new partner.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.644
Paul Carr.

06:16.677 --> 06:20.047
Seven years homicide,
Wasatch County.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.484
That's him.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.927
- Come on in, Paul.
- Morning, Lieutenant.

06:33.995 --> 06:35.428
Riley, Paul.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.396
Hey.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.503
Paul's been working with us
for about three weeks.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.738
I think this is a good pairing.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.608
Looking forward to it.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.511
All right.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.080
Paul's going to get you
up to date on the current cases.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.987
Good to have you back,
Detective.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.504
You don't have to talk about it.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.075
I haven't read the report.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.576
I don't need to know
what happened.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.816
But if you ever
do want to talk about it,

07:28.849 --> 07:30.184
I know you were...

07:30.217 --> 07:32.452
How about you tell me
about the current cases?

07:34.789 --> 07:35.823
Right.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.560
Couple things.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.896
Stabbing outside city creek.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.864
Older woman.
Looks like a mugging.

07:44.265 --> 07:46.867
Um, here's a strange one.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.704
We found a man
locked inside a dark room,

07:49.737 --> 07:52.506
dead of a heart attack.

07:52.540 --> 07:55.076
It was a while back.
A couple weeks ago.

07:55.109 --> 07:56.711
He locked himself in?

07:56.744 --> 07:59.714
No. Door had
an external padlock.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.016
Was there any sign
of a struggle?

08:03.217 --> 08:05.286
The man was bound to a chair.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.154
No fingerprints.

08:07.188 --> 08:11.092
He was a loner.
Stayed inside.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.995
No family, few friends.

08:14.028 --> 08:15.596
We got nothing.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.504
Can I take a look at the file?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.127
Please help...

09:53.160 --> 09:55.029
Are you willing?

10:12.246 --> 10:13.948
Morning.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.983
What have we got here?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.085
Dead body.
That's all I know.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.750
Her stuff's in the other room.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.388
Couch, lamps.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.957
It's just like eight lamps.

10:56.991 --> 10:59.360
Who has eight lamps?

11:01.228 --> 11:03.764
Someone afraid of the dark.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.367
You know, this took a lot to do.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.337
I painted my place a month ago,
and it took me all weekend.

11:10.371 --> 11:14.108
What's her name?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.076
Name? Ask him.

11:23.384 --> 11:26.320
Kimberly Parker.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.421
What happened?

11:27.454 --> 11:29.423
She had a heart attack.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.759
Who was F.O.S.?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.060
Again.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.428
I was, ma'am.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.364
Neighbor usually brings
the victim in her mail.

11:37.398 --> 11:40.768
When she wasn't answering,
neighbor called it in.

11:41.869 --> 11:42.970
All right. Thank you.

11:46.340 --> 11:49.009
Someone binds her up
like that

11:49.043 --> 11:51.212
and paints
the entire room red?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.750
No. None of it's on her.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.953
It was dry
when she was placed here.

12:01.222 --> 12:02.156
What's that?

12:04.191 --> 12:07.328
It's a dressing.

12:07.361 --> 12:08.495
It's fresh.

12:08.530 --> 12:10.931
Must've been a struggle.

12:10.965 --> 12:12.534
Yeah. She fought back,
got hurt,

12:12.567 --> 12:16.770
and someone bandaged her
and chained her up.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.405
How fresh is it?

12:18.439 --> 12:19.974
Within 24 hours.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.543
Why dress the wound?

12:21.576 --> 12:23.377
And what's the point
of all the red?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.279
Well, I once had a body

12:25.312 --> 12:29.350
with a teddy bear
sewed up inside it.

12:29.383 --> 12:33.454
You can't make sense
of the senseless.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.422
Why is this entire room red?

12:35.456 --> 12:38.259
I'm supposed to have
guesses on that?

12:39.527 --> 12:41.395
The address is different
on her license.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.566
Let's check it out.

12:44.599 --> 12:46.200
Yeah, well...

13:04.184 --> 13:05.953
I'm so sorry.

13:11.125 --> 13:15.162
She was afraid of
people, things.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.131
The... The out there.

13:18.566 --> 13:20.968
She wouldn't leave
her place alone,

13:21.001 --> 13:23.037
even around the block.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.508
But sometimes, I would,
I would take her outside

13:26.541 --> 13:29.109
to get some fresh air.

13:29.143 --> 13:30.277
Blindfolded.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.179
Blindfolded?

13:32.212 --> 13:35.449
If she saw the color red,
she panicked.

13:38.052 --> 13:39.286
It was...

13:40.454 --> 13:42.289
frightening.

13:42.323 --> 13:43.891
Why?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.560
Well, there's this condition

13:45.593 --> 13:48.563
that the mind
can't perceive color.

13:48.596 --> 13:52.433
It's monochromacy.

13:52.466 --> 13:55.302
Color is an illusion.
It's not real.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.174
My red and your red
aren't the same.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.645
We all think we're seeing color
the same, but we're not.

14:03.678 --> 14:06.648
Everything is perception.

14:06.681 --> 14:09.183
It's...

14:09.216 --> 14:12.052
essentially meaningless.

14:12.086 --> 14:14.321
I'm sorry.
Did she have this?

14:14.355 --> 14:16.190
No. She suffers...

14:17.925 --> 14:22.463
Uh, she had chronic phobia.

14:22.496 --> 14:26.233
Erythrophobia.
It's the fear of the color red.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.671
Did she ever see anyone
for this condition?

14:29.704 --> 14:34.208
There's a doctor.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.910
I took her.

14:36.944 --> 14:40.914
There's a program.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.551
She said she was special.

14:43.585 --> 14:48.556
That these people,
these phobics...

14:51.158 --> 14:53.561
I mean, you have no idea.

14:57.131 --> 14:59.066
Do you have the name
of this doctor?

15:09.410 --> 15:11.078
She wasn't normal.

15:14.716 --> 15:16.450
But she was my daughter.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.627
Was it suicide?

15:25.660 --> 15:27.529
It doesn't appear to be.

15:34.168 --> 15:35.503
Thank you for your time.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.374
Give it!

16:19.480 --> 16:22.015
Don't hurt him! Don't.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.585
Shh.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.354
No one's gonna hurt you.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.230
What are you doing here?

16:38.131 --> 16:41.268
I'm Detective Sanders.
This is Detective Carr.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.136
We'd like to ask you
some questions

16:43.170 --> 16:44.706
about one of your patients.

16:48.843 --> 16:50.210
That was interesting.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.253
Phobias are crippling.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.757
What I do here is
a last resort for people.

17:02.790 --> 17:05.292
They come here when they have
nowhere else to turn.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.227
Like Kimberly Parker?

17:11.465 --> 17:13.433
She is my patient

17:13.467 --> 17:16.571
and also a subject in
a restricted sponsored study.

17:16.604 --> 17:18.806
Was.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.842
Someone painted her walls red.

17:20.875 --> 17:24.579
She was found dead,
chained to a chair.

17:24.612 --> 17:28.115
You think of any reason someone
would paint her walls like that?

17:35.857 --> 17:39.594
Yes, if they wanted to hurt her.

17:41.563 --> 17:43.463
Can we see your files?

17:56.143 --> 17:57.177
What's this?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.446
Rorschach test cards.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.815
What do you see?

18:07.589 --> 18:09.524
Nothing.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.798
You show a phobic
Rorschach test,

18:16.831 --> 18:21.168
and they inevitably see
their fear in the inkblots.

18:23.170 --> 18:27.642
What they see reveals their fear
over and over.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.277
So?

18:30.310 --> 18:32.446
What do you see, Detective?

18:34.949 --> 18:36.483
Just a bunch of ink.

18:41.789 --> 18:44.191
And the files?

18:45.593 --> 18:47.494
Unfortunately,
that's all I can say.

18:48.630 --> 18:49.697
I figured as much.

20:46.781 --> 20:50.051
There's some weird phobias
out there.

20:50.084 --> 20:53.821
Lachenophobia:
fear of vegetables.

20:53.855 --> 20:57.324
I mean, never been
a fan of celery,

20:57.357 --> 20:58.826
but I can't see one stalking me.

21:03.598 --> 21:05.332
Really? That's it?

21:06.601 --> 21:07.802
Mm-hmm.

21:07.835 --> 21:10.470
Wow. I worked on that
last night.

21:10.505 --> 21:11.606
Told it to my mom.

21:11.639 --> 21:12.907
Yeah? How'd that play?

21:12.940 --> 21:14.542
Much better.

21:14.575 --> 21:16.010
Yeah?

21:16.043 --> 21:17.979
That's cool.
She has a sense of humor.

21:20.014 --> 21:21.649
So I had a thought.

21:21.682 --> 21:23.918
Mm, is this like a celery bit?

21:23.951 --> 21:25.052
No.

21:26.621 --> 21:28.022
That night of your incident.

21:31.559 --> 21:32.693
I read your file.

21:32.727 --> 21:34.862
Great.

21:34.896 --> 21:36.496
You were in peril and...

21:36.531 --> 21:38.331
I was in peril?

21:38.365 --> 21:40.568
Is this another thing
you tried out on your mom?

21:40.601 --> 21:42.603
Come on.
You know what I mean.

21:48.009 --> 21:51.378
You were in danger,
and you were restrained.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.648
Reminds me of
Kimberly Parker's murder.

21:56.517 --> 21:58.719
Kimberly Parker was found
in a room painted red,

21:58.753 --> 21:59.854
bound to a chair.

21:59.887 --> 22:01.823
Restrained like you were.

22:03.925 --> 22:05.793
Look, there was nothing
in your file.

22:05.827 --> 22:08.729
Was there something else
that happened to you that night?

22:08.763 --> 22:10.832
Was there something else
in the room?

22:10.865 --> 22:13.333
Did he do anything to you?

22:23.744 --> 22:27.114
What happened to me
was its own thing.

22:27.148 --> 22:28.916
I mean, really, if anything,
the Kimberly Parker case

22:28.950 --> 22:30.885
is more like that case
that you told me about

22:30.918 --> 22:34.021
with the guy that was
locked in the room.

22:34.055 --> 22:35.823
Yeah.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.764
I got this.

22:49.203 --> 22:50.972
Let me see that.

22:56.878 --> 22:58.512
Salt Lake PD?

22:58.546 --> 23:00.982
My father.

23:01.015 --> 23:03.918
He was shot in the line of duty.

23:06.153 --> 23:09.156
They gave the watch
to my mother.

23:09.190 --> 23:11.559
She gave it to me
when I made detective.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.895
I'm sorry.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.001
Paul, look at me.

23:22.603 --> 23:25.172
I'm really sorry.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.442
He knew your dad.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.679
Yeah?

23:31.712 --> 23:35.415
Yeah. I mean, they weren't close
or anything, but yeah.

23:38.686 --> 23:41.155
I know I want to have you over
for dinner.

23:44.659 --> 23:46.027
I got this.

25:03.904 --> 25:05.773
All right.

25:05.806 --> 25:07.742
Yeah, I understand.
Thank you.

25:10.644 --> 25:12.213
Nothing.

25:12.246 --> 25:15.182
Well, these files that she
gave us have nothing in them.

25:15.216 --> 25:17.852
Just names and redacted records.

25:17.885 --> 25:19.587
I know.

25:22.256 --> 25:24.759
No way.

25:24.792 --> 25:26.127
Samuel Leslie.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.262
That was our case.

25:28.295 --> 25:30.698
Wasn't that the guy that was in
the locked room?

25:30.731 --> 25:32.299
Yeah.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.868
What was this fear?

25:35.002 --> 25:36.270
Darkness.

25:36.303 --> 25:38.773
I told you it was similar.

25:38.806 --> 25:41.008
You did.

25:41.042 --> 25:43.344
She obviously knew that he died,

25:43.377 --> 25:45.346
and she didn't say anything
to us about it.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.881
Yep.

25:48.282 --> 25:51.152
Some of this stuff
is fascinating.

25:51.185 --> 25:52.753
She transfers their fear

25:52.787 --> 25:54.188
from whatever it is
they're afraid of

25:54.221 --> 25:56.223
to something totally different,

25:56.257 --> 25:58.759
like a bell or lights.

26:04.732 --> 26:06.333
What do you mean, lights?

26:06.367 --> 26:11.072
It says they use a white light
with a repeater.

26:11.105 --> 26:13.340
Guessing that's like a strobe.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.710
Anyway, after that, they...

26:16.744 --> 26:20.948
no longer afraid of dogs
or sharks or whatever.

26:20.981 --> 26:23.651
It's the bells or lights.

26:24.852 --> 26:27.755
That's the theory, anyway.

26:36.397 --> 26:38.065
One of the files mentions

26:38.099 --> 26:42.636
"crisis-powered physiological
enhancement phenomenon."

26:42.670 --> 26:44.171
You heard of that one?

26:44.205 --> 26:45.906
What?

26:45.940 --> 26:48.242
Oh. It's also called
"excited delirium,"

26:48.275 --> 26:50.878
like when a mom
lifts a car off her kid.

26:50.911 --> 26:53.314
Yeah, that's not a real thing.

26:53.347 --> 26:56.650
Yeah, but there's a ton of stuff
on the Internet about it.

26:56.684 --> 26:58.853
This woman
protected her children

26:58.886 --> 27:00.988
from a polar bear attack.

27:01.021 --> 27:02.356
Stuff like that.

27:02.389 --> 27:04.391
You know what else
is on the Internet?

27:04.425 --> 27:07.728
- Stories about Bloody Mary.
- Who?

27:07.761 --> 27:10.698
Where you look in the mirror
and say Bloody Mary three times.

27:10.731 --> 27:14.235
I guess I missed that one.
What happens?

27:16.237 --> 27:18.439
She, uh...

27:18.472 --> 27:20.341
She appears.

27:22.143 --> 27:25.346
Anyway, it's all urban legend.

27:55.276 --> 27:57.044
Get me some of that.

27:57.077 --> 27:58.946
Can you put that here?

27:58.979 --> 28:00.347
Detective.

28:05.019 --> 28:08.189
- What happened to the lights?
- Somebody cut the power.

28:08.222 --> 28:10.391
Whoever did this
brought their own lights.

28:10.424 --> 28:13.027
Hey, can you hold off on that?

28:20.234 --> 28:23.470
What happened to his face?

28:23.505 --> 28:29.443
Well, I found bits of cornea
underneath his fingernails.

28:29.476 --> 28:33.380
I think, I mean
as far as I can see,

28:33.414 --> 28:36.016
he was trying
to scratch his eyes out.

28:37.519 --> 28:40.254
I've never seen anything
like this.

28:42.790 --> 28:45.859
What is this, panic?

28:45.893 --> 28:47.461
I don't know.

28:47.494 --> 28:49.797
What is that?

28:49.830 --> 28:52.099
Book of phobias.

28:52.132 --> 28:56.770
Pediaphobia: fear of dolls
and mannequins.

28:56.804 --> 28:59.039
I don't blame him.

28:59.073 --> 29:00.374
Any other injuries?

29:00.407 --> 29:02.309
Nothing like the first victim.

29:02.343 --> 29:06.480
No bandages,
no defensive wounds.

29:06.514 --> 29:07.982
Holden.

29:09.584 --> 29:13.454
We need to get a list
of everyone in her program.

29:13.487 --> 29:14.421
Yeah.

30:35.436 --> 30:38.272
Please. Please help.

30:52.386 --> 30:54.589
Your father was a few years
behind me at the academy,

30:54.622 --> 30:57.024
but I remember him.

30:57.057 --> 30:59.893
Terrible tragedy what happened.

31:04.431 --> 31:06.266
I carry it with me.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.868
Hmm.

31:10.605 --> 31:12.373
It's nice.

31:12.406 --> 31:14.509
It's very nice.
You should be proud.

31:16.276 --> 31:18.145
He was one of the good guys.

31:18.178 --> 31:20.180
He thought fondly of you
as well.

31:21.649 --> 31:23.551
He gave me that book
they wrote about you.

31:25.587 --> 31:28.255
Had a huge impact
on my life, sir.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.661
How did you know?

31:33.695 --> 31:35.262
Hmm?

31:35.295 --> 31:36.698
The man you shot.

31:36.731 --> 31:38.465
Mm.

31:38.499 --> 31:42.136
How did you know
he wasn't the husband?

31:42.169 --> 31:47.141
When I went to the door,
I asked to speak to the wife.

31:47.174 --> 31:48.710
When she came out,

31:48.743 --> 31:52.279
said it was just
a dumb argument.

31:52.312 --> 31:54.582
We turned to go back inside.

31:54.616 --> 31:58.452
It was, uh,
it was the way touched her.

31:58.485 --> 32:00.487
You know, you could tell.

32:03.056 --> 32:05.125
Yeah, the author of the book

32:05.159 --> 32:09.263
tried to sell that
as police instinct.

32:11.265 --> 32:15.102
Afraid that was just dumb luck.

32:15.135 --> 32:20.207
I mean, I drew
my service revolver and fired

32:20.240 --> 32:26.013
a millisecond before I felt
his round crashing in my leg.

32:26.046 --> 32:28.550
Do you know what they found
in his house?

32:28.583 --> 32:30.484
The one he shot?

32:30.518 --> 32:32.352
Really?

32:35.590 --> 32:37.057
Just what was in the book.

32:38.526 --> 32:40.227
There were horrible things.

32:41.563 --> 32:43.197
Things with children.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.132
The kind of things
that you would never imagine,

32:45.165 --> 32:46.166
unless you saw them.

32:47.535 --> 32:49.269
The evil men do.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.241
I'm sorry. What was that?

32:55.442 --> 32:57.077
There are people,

32:57.110 --> 33:01.549
men who have urges,
compulsions,

33:01.583 --> 33:05.352
and you could understand
their crimes.

33:05.385 --> 33:07.589
I mean, not the deeds they do,

33:07.622 --> 33:11.124
but you can understand
why they do things

33:11.158 --> 33:12.694
and the psychology.

33:12.727 --> 33:16.029
But men like the one I shot

33:16.063 --> 33:21.101
isn't afflicted by weakness
or an urge.

33:21.134 --> 33:23.671
It's methodical.

33:23.705 --> 33:25.540
It's who they are.

33:25.573 --> 33:29.711
And I knew there were
thousands like him.

33:29.744 --> 33:32.312
If I got them all,
it wouldn't matter

33:32.346 --> 33:34.181
because they keep coming,
like the plague.

33:34.214 --> 33:38.218
That's what I thought back then,

33:38.252 --> 33:39.654
so I quit.

33:41.388 --> 33:43.290
What?

33:43.323 --> 33:45.125
In that moment, I told Riles

33:45.158 --> 33:48.495
she'd never have to spend
another night in a hospital.

33:48.530 --> 33:51.799
Not with me, anyway.

33:51.833 --> 33:55.168
And she says,

33:55.202 --> 33:57.772
"Daddy, if you quit,

33:57.805 --> 33:59.741
who's gonna catch
the bad guys?"

34:02.777 --> 34:05.479
Fear is paralyzing.

34:05.513 --> 34:10.117
And I knew it was fear
feeding on me.

34:10.150 --> 34:13.186
I knew the only thing more
powerful in this world than fear

34:13.220 --> 34:14.589
was hope.

34:16.290 --> 34:18.693
So I let hope in,

34:18.726 --> 34:22.129
and I stayed on and...

34:23.765 --> 34:26.099
I could see it.

34:26.133 --> 34:30.270
Brief moments when fear would,
would all but fade away.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.778
When Riley asked who would
do this job if I didn't,

34:36.811 --> 34:38.713
something clicked.

34:38.746 --> 34:42.416
I saw things in a way
I never had.

34:42.449 --> 34:47.655
I mean, just as there'd always
be men like the one I shot,

34:47.689 --> 34:50.357
there'd always be cops.

34:50.390 --> 34:52.392
Good cops.

34:52.426 --> 34:56.096
Like your dad, like you,
like my Riles.

34:58.566 --> 35:00.868
Because someone
has to do this job.

35:24.525 --> 35:26.761
I think it's bizarre you live
in the house you grew up in

35:26.794 --> 35:28.563
and not your father.

35:28.596 --> 35:30.197
Why?

35:30.230 --> 35:33.601
I mean, he wanted to move
for some reason, and...

35:36.236 --> 35:38.573
I just couldn't imagine
anyone else living here.

35:41.341 --> 35:45.613
You know, the last gift
my father gave me

35:45.647 --> 35:46.681
was your dad's book.

35:48.716 --> 35:52.219
I'm so sorry that
you had to go through that,

35:52.252 --> 35:53.487
losing your dad.

35:57.324 --> 35:59.961
Strange thing being a cop,

35:59.994 --> 36:04.632
but I enjoyed listening
to your dad talk about it.

36:04.666 --> 36:07.902
You're a lot like him.

36:07.935 --> 36:10.772
Don't patronize me.

36:10.805 --> 36:12.907
No, I mean...

36:18.913 --> 36:20.515
I think you should probably go.

36:32.492 --> 36:36.664
Why does that bother you...

36:36.698 --> 36:39.567
when I say you're like
your father?

36:40.768 --> 36:42.704
Paul...

36:42.737 --> 36:45.640
I know you're killing yourself
over what happened that night.

36:47.307 --> 36:49.711
Nobody is as wound as tight
as you are

36:49.744 --> 36:51.746
without there being more to it.

36:53.681 --> 36:56.483
The thing about my dad,

36:56.517 --> 36:59.453
that night that he
saved that family,

36:59.486 --> 37:02.289
he showed no fear.

37:02.322 --> 37:04.324
Or maybe he got lucky.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.462
And I don't know what happened,

37:08.495 --> 37:11.733
but I don't believe
for one second

37:11.766 --> 37:13.568
that it was your fault.

37:17.471 --> 37:20.373
Riley...

37:20.407 --> 37:22.242
what happened?

37:30.885 --> 37:33.521
I'm sorry.
I think you should go.

39:25.066 --> 39:26.433
Yeah?

39:26.466 --> 39:28.703
- <i>Informant called me.</i>
- Who?

39:28.736 --> 39:30.538
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Paul, what's going on?

39:30.571 --> 39:32.472
<i>Said to come alone,
but he said to call you.</i>

39:32.506 --> 39:34.008
Paul, where are you?

39:34.041 --> 39:35.676
<i>He knows what happened to you
that night.</i>

39:35.710 --> 39:37.812
<i>He said to go to
353 Harley Street.</i>

39:37.845 --> 39:39.513
Paul, stop. Pull over.

39:39.547 --> 39:41.849
<i>I promise
we'll figure this out.</i>

39:41.883 --> 39:43.918
Paul. Paul!

40:36.137 --> 40:37.605
Stop.

41:40.201 --> 41:42.803
No! Please! Help me! Oh, my...

41:42.837 --> 41:46.707
Oh, no! Oh, stop! God!

41:46.741 --> 41:51.278
Oh, no! Please! No! Oh, God!

41:51.312 --> 41:53.948
Please! Please! Please! Please!

42:11.198 --> 42:14.835
Please! Please!

43:57.771 --> 43:59.740
What's the matter with him?

44:01.942 --> 44:03.711
He just needs some rest.

44:05.246 --> 44:07.047
He's at risk.

44:07.081 --> 44:09.316
All of your patients are.
We've been looking for him.

44:09.350 --> 44:11.218
He's safe here.

44:11.252 --> 44:13.220
Are the rest of
your patients here?

44:13.254 --> 44:15.923
This isn't an inpatient program.

44:15.956 --> 44:18.926
Someone's killing your patients.

44:18.959 --> 44:22.129
Another one was murdered
last night.

44:22.163 --> 44:23.697
I know.

44:25.266 --> 44:27.768
I am not leaving here
without some answers.

44:30.337 --> 44:32.006
My research indicated a link

44:32.039 --> 44:34.341
between the reactions
of clinical phobics

44:34.375 --> 44:37.745
and the phenomenon known as
"excited delirium."

44:37.778 --> 44:39.446
Yeah, I've heard of that.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.182
It's like moms
lifting cars off kids

44:41.215 --> 44:43.918
or fending off polar bears
or whatever.

44:43.951 --> 44:46.720
- It's preposterous.
- No, Riley.

44:49.757 --> 44:51.959
Do you understand
the implications?

44:51.992 --> 44:54.261
Of what?

44:54.295 --> 44:56.730
Never being weak
in any situation.

44:56.764 --> 45:02.002
Never being afraid
of anything. Riley.

45:02.036 --> 45:04.371
Not the dark.

45:04.405 --> 45:06.740
Nothing ever again.

45:09.410 --> 45:11.445
Do you know something about me?

45:17.418 --> 45:19.353
What's the matter with me?

45:33.100 --> 45:34.401
Stop.

45:39.541 --> 45:41.075
Come with me.

46:00.894 --> 46:02.029
What is this?

46:03.397 --> 46:04.932
How are you sleeping?

46:06.867 --> 46:08.402
What?

46:08.435 --> 46:11.905
I'm sorry. I can't explain
everything, Riley.

46:11.939 --> 46:14.208
But deep down, you know.

46:18.613 --> 46:21.882
You trying to get in my head?

46:21.915 --> 46:23.851
Look at that
when you're alone.

46:28.355 --> 46:30.257
It's time for you
to go now, Riley.

46:30.291 --> 46:32.359
I don't even know
what you mean.

46:32.393 --> 46:33.994
Goodbye, Riley.

47:27.081 --> 47:28.248
Right, Sully?

47:29.483 --> 47:30.618
Get your story straight!

47:30.652 --> 47:32.986
Did we wake you?

47:33.020 --> 47:34.955
I'm hungry.

47:36.290 --> 47:38.859
Just grab some pizza
in the kitchen.

48:46.226 --> 48:47.662
Help.

48:51.398 --> 48:52.332
Daddy.

48:55.737 --> 48:58.071
Hey, Sully, you down here?

48:58.105 --> 48:59.473
Daddy.

48:59.507 --> 49:01.308
- Where are you?
- Over here!

49:09.082 --> 49:10.417
Daddy.

49:17.224 --> 49:18.325
Help me.

49:43.417 --> 49:46.386
I passed out.

49:46.420 --> 49:50.090
And when I woke up
the next morning,

49:50.123 --> 49:52.694
you were gone.

49:52.727 --> 49:57.665
I couldn't find you anywhere.
I called all my friends.

49:57.699 --> 49:59.333
When we checked
all your friends' houses

49:59.366 --> 50:04.171
and then to the mall
and the parks, everywhere,

50:04.204 --> 50:07.341
I couldn't find you anywhere,

50:07.374 --> 50:10.545
so I just, I came home, and...

50:10.578 --> 50:12.079
<i>I just sat on
that old blue sofa</i>

50:12.112 --> 50:14.014
<i>we used to have
in the living room.</i>

50:15.517 --> 50:18.520
<i>I was so scared, Riley.</i>

50:18.553 --> 50:21.288
<i>I've never been more afraid
in my entire life.</i>

50:21.321 --> 50:23.290
<i>I wanted the earth
to swallow me.</i>

50:23.323 --> 50:26.293
<i>I was so ashamed.</i>

50:26.326 --> 50:29.531
<i>I was sure I'd lost you.</i>

50:29.564 --> 50:32.299
<i>Then I heard this scratching.</i>

50:32.332 --> 50:34.636
<i>Then I realized I'd been
hearing it all along,</i>

50:34.669 --> 50:35.737
<i>but it didn't register
until then.</i>

50:35.770 --> 50:38.138
<i>And this...</i>

50:38.171 --> 50:40.775
<i>this small flicker of hope
trickled in.</i>

50:43.143 --> 50:45.513
<i>I stopped breathing
and listened.</i>

50:49.416 --> 50:50.618
<i>I could hear it.</i>

50:54.321 --> 50:56.824
<i>In the kitchen,
it was louder</i>

51:00.862 --> 51:02.797
<i>I went to the basement door...</i>

51:05.900 --> 51:08.068
<i>and down those stairs.</i>

51:12.306 --> 51:13.675
When I saw you...

51:18.378 --> 51:20.247
I am so sorry.

51:22.517 --> 51:26.153
And that next night,
you... you couldn't sleep.

51:26.186 --> 51:28.523
You'd have the lights on.

51:28.556 --> 51:32.326
And then you...
you wet the bed.

51:32.359 --> 51:34.829
And that just went on and on.

51:34.862 --> 51:36.798
I mean, it was so hard on you.

51:39.433 --> 51:40.535
You were so afraid of the dark,

51:40.568 --> 51:43.303
I had to take you
to a specialist.

51:43.337 --> 51:45.540
Holden.

51:45.573 --> 51:47.875
Yeah, Holden.

51:49.409 --> 51:54.414
And, uh,
and she diagnosed you as...

51:54.448 --> 51:55.617
"Aclophobic."

51:55.650 --> 51:58.251
Extreme fear of the dark.

51:58.285 --> 52:00.454
And hypnophobic,

52:00.487 --> 52:01.889
fear of sleep.

52:04.959 --> 52:07.762
You were literally afraid
to close your eyes.

52:11.398 --> 52:14.769
So I agreed
to let her work with you.

52:20.307 --> 52:21.809
<i>You saw her
for about a month.</i>

52:32.219 --> 52:33.387
<i>And then...</i>

52:33.420 --> 52:36.223
one night,
you could sleep again.

52:36.256 --> 52:39.727
You never wet the bed, and...

52:39.761 --> 52:43.330
Holden assured me that,
that you were cured.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.969
She, uh...

52:48.002 --> 52:50.237
she transferred my fears
to this...

52:50.270 --> 52:53.306
<i>flashing strobe light.</i>

53:03.250 --> 53:05.485
I didn't know anything about any
lights or anything like that.

53:05.520 --> 53:07.755
You never mentioned it.

53:07.789 --> 53:09.957
But it...

53:09.991 --> 53:14.327
it seemed like
you blocked it out, you know?

53:14.361 --> 53:17.397
And...

53:17.431 --> 53:21.401
I was so ashamed, I never said
anything about it again.

53:21.435 --> 53:24.005
And I...

53:24.038 --> 53:25.973
Eventually, I forgot.

53:28.509 --> 53:30.377
Time does that.

53:37.885 --> 53:39.587
I'm sorry.

53:41.622 --> 53:44.692
I had a moment today when
I thought I was losing my mind.

53:49.831 --> 53:54.001
That I'd done things
that I wasn't aware of.

53:56.671 --> 53:59.339
None of this is your fault.

54:01.509 --> 54:02.710
I love you.

54:02.744 --> 54:04.377
I love you.

54:39.981 --> 54:41.549
<i>Daddy.</i>

55:28.495 --> 55:30.565
<i>I'm dying.</i>

55:33.167 --> 55:34.467
<i>Help.</i>

55:44.545 --> 55:45.513
<i>Help.</i>

57:17.972 --> 57:20.041
Whoa! Riley, it's me.

57:20.074 --> 57:22.176
Were you in my backyard?

57:22.209 --> 57:24.578
What? Of course not.

57:24.612 --> 57:25.880
Riley, no.

57:29.884 --> 57:32.920
What's wrong?

57:32.954 --> 57:35.856
Somebody's in my garage.

57:35.890 --> 57:36.958
I got you.

57:36.991 --> 57:38.159
- Okay.
- Let's go.

58:43.758 --> 58:44.959
That's not mine.

58:56.871 --> 59:00.041
This is more complicated
than we thought.

59:00.074 --> 59:01.942
She's been at this for years.

59:01.976 --> 59:05.179
She's helped dozens of people
with replacement therapy.

59:11.385 --> 59:12.686
Look at this.

59:19.060 --> 59:20.795
"Herta Ivanovich."

59:20.828 --> 59:22.096
From the Stalin era.

59:22.129 --> 59:24.965
Back when they were doing
weird programs.

59:24.999 --> 59:26.333
Like that Nazis?

59:26.367 --> 59:27.968
Weirder.

59:28.002 --> 59:31.338
Stalin wanted to create
a human-animal hybrid.

59:31.372 --> 59:32.940
Bizarre programs like that.

59:32.973 --> 59:36.277
They would put parents
in sealed rooms,

59:36.310 --> 59:38.279
in front of a curtain,

59:38.312 --> 59:39.980
bind them to chairs...

59:41.849 --> 59:44.018
pull back the curtain,

59:44.051 --> 59:46.187
and their children would be
behind a glass window,

59:46.220 --> 59:47.988
and they'd...

59:49.790 --> 59:50.758
do things to them.

59:53.127 --> 59:55.796
They were trying to see
if they could break out.

59:57.798 --> 59:58.933
Did they?

59:58.966 --> 1:00:01.902
Doesn't say.

1:00:01.936 --> 1:00:04.338
Just trying to induce
the crisis-powered

1:00:04.371 --> 1:00:05.840
physiological enhancement...

1:00:05.873 --> 1:00:07.274
yeah, polar bears.

1:00:13.347 --> 1:00:15.382
That's what they did to you,
isn't it?

1:00:21.222 --> 1:00:23.257
But they never broke me.

1:00:25.926 --> 1:00:27.394
I'm fine.

1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:41.642
What if it were possible?

1:00:43.043 --> 1:00:45.446
The super human strength.

1:00:45.479 --> 1:00:48.182
It's not. That's crazy.

1:00:48.215 --> 1:00:49.783
Obviously somebody believes it.

1:00:49.817 --> 1:00:51.886
They keep doing
these experiments.

1:00:53.420 --> 1:00:54.655
Yeah.

1:01:05.866 --> 1:01:07.067
Paul.

1:01:07.101 --> 1:01:08.769
Yeah?

1:01:11.238 --> 1:01:12.940
If you wouldn't have
come tonight...

1:01:12.973 --> 1:01:15.142
I know.

1:01:21.348 --> 1:01:25.119
You think that's what
he was trying to do with me?

1:01:25.152 --> 1:01:26.921
What do you mean?

1:01:26.954 --> 1:01:29.823
When he called me
to that building.

1:01:29.857 --> 1:01:32.092
Got you there.

1:01:32.126 --> 1:01:35.362
You think he was going to
put you behind the glass?

1:01:35.396 --> 1:01:36.897
Wait a minute.

1:01:43.070 --> 1:01:45.072
This is the building
that I found you in.

1:01:45.105 --> 1:01:46.907
What?

1:01:46.941 --> 1:01:49.476
It's hard to tell
'cause it's an old photo,

1:01:49.511 --> 1:01:52.880
but that's the building.

1:01:54.848 --> 1:01:56.784
What's this doing
in Holden's files?

1:02:34.355 --> 1:02:37.391
This place used to be owned by
a company called Marks-Ferry.

1:02:37.424 --> 1:02:39.293
Holden?

1:02:39.326 --> 1:02:41.895
She sat on their board.

1:02:43.330 --> 1:02:45.266
Let's find a way in.

1:02:56.043 --> 1:02:59.113
Paul, I think this is the place
I was treated when I was a kid.

1:02:59.146 --> 1:03:01.015
Are you sure?

1:03:05.386 --> 1:03:06.820
Hey.

1:03:06.854 --> 1:03:09.089
This is about them.

1:03:15.963 --> 1:03:18.165
Let's meet around back.

1:03:18.198 --> 1:03:22.036
If there's an open door,
don't go in without me.

1:03:24.171 --> 1:03:25.272
I'm fine.

1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:27.474
All right.

1:04:22.996 --> 1:04:24.164
Dr. Holden?

1:04:28.469 --> 1:04:30.404
Dr. Holden, can you hear me?

1:04:34.975 --> 1:04:36.076
What's going on?

1:04:36.110 --> 1:04:37.512
I don't know.

1:04:38.212 --> 1:04:39.313
Is she okay?

1:04:40.582 --> 1:04:42.082
Put her down!

1:04:46.353 --> 1:04:48.922
Please.

1:04:48.956 --> 1:04:50.224
Put her down!

1:04:58.198 --> 1:04:59.601
Stop.

1:05:01.135 --> 1:05:02.236
Stop!

1:05:05.038 --> 1:05:06.508
What the hell?

1:05:11.378 --> 1:05:13.180
Don't hurt him!

1:05:14.281 --> 1:05:15.416
No!

1:06:34.796 --> 1:06:36.698
You could take your mask off.

1:06:39.132 --> 1:06:40.400
Your breathing.

1:07:07.762 --> 1:07:09.363
You're like me.

1:07:35.523 --> 1:07:36.824
Riley!

1:07:38.526 --> 1:07:41.629
Riley! Let her go,
you son of a bitch!

1:09:29.604 --> 1:09:30.772
Riley!

1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:34.809
Riley!

1:10:47.815 --> 1:10:48.850
Paul...

1:10:50.885 --> 1:10:52.987
I know.

1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:55.355
Find her.

1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:34.589
Is this her?

1:12:37.658 --> 1:12:38.659
Yeah.

1:12:44.799 --> 1:12:46.133
It was a miracle.

1:12:46.167 --> 1:12:49.837
If she hadn't been there,
Mikey...

1:12:58.012 --> 1:12:59.814
Can I have this?

1:12:59.847 --> 1:13:01.115
Yeah, sure.

1:13:04.819 --> 1:13:07.521
I was wondering if you could
show me where it happened.

1:13:09.090 --> 1:13:10.658
Of course.

1:13:10.691 --> 1:13:11.792
You good?

1:13:28.676 --> 1:13:30.645
So the car slid off the road

1:13:30.678 --> 1:13:32.847
and landed somewhere,
somewhere around here.

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:34.015
Isn't that right, Mikey?

1:13:34.048 --> 1:13:36.083
Yeah, right here.

1:13:43.157 --> 1:13:45.126
Where did she come from?

1:13:45.159 --> 1:13:46.661
I wish I knew.

1:13:46.694 --> 1:13:49.063
I was so focused on Mikey
and what she did

1:13:49.096 --> 1:13:50.998
because she...

1:13:52.633 --> 1:13:54.501
It wasn't possible.

1:13:56.203 --> 1:13:59.040
You didn't see
where she came from?

1:13:59.073 --> 1:14:01.575
She was just there.

1:14:01.609 --> 1:14:03.544
She came out of the sky.

1:14:05.279 --> 1:14:06.881
Show me.

1:14:12.253 --> 1:14:13.587
Thanks.

1:14:14.188 --> 1:14:15.756
So is she...

1:14:15.790 --> 1:14:17.725
Is she in some kind
of trouble?

1:14:18.826 --> 1:14:21.228
I just need to find her.

1:14:21.262 --> 1:14:23.898
Okay, who are you, really?

1:14:25.166 --> 1:14:26.701
I'm her friend.

1:14:29.070 --> 1:14:31.639
We want to thank her.

1:14:31.672 --> 1:14:33.040
If you find her,

1:14:33.074 --> 1:14:35.710
will you tell her, please?

1:14:35.743 --> 1:14:38.779
She's, um...

1:14:38.813 --> 1:14:40.081
She's pretty incredible.

1:14:41.148 --> 1:14:42.750
Absolutely.

1:14:43.818 --> 1:14:45.753
Thanks. And good luck.

1:14:45.786 --> 1:14:46.787
Let's go, bud.

1:15:40.808 --> 1:15:44.078
His regenerative capacity
was greatly increased,

1:15:44.111 --> 1:15:45.913
but we were unable to save him.

1:15:47.348 --> 1:15:49.116
Preserve the brain.

1:15:49.150 --> 1:15:52.119
They'll want to study it,
see how it worked.

1:15:52.153 --> 1:15:54.221
Of course.

1:15:54.255 --> 1:15:55.890
Any news on the other?

1:15:57.258 --> 1:15:58.292
Nothing yet.

1:16:00.227 --> 1:16:02.163
We need to find her
before they do.

1:16:03.831 --> 1:16:06.934
This was all for her,
wasn't it?

1:16:06.967 --> 1:16:08.169
Yes.

1:16:10.738 --> 1:16:12.573
All for Riley.
