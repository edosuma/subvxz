00:00.301 --> 00:02.633
Thomas, how do you
really feel about me?

00:02.836 --> 00:03.894
I like you.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.033
You think I'll ever walk again? Sure.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.503
What's happening? Just
stay down and hold on!

00:13.380 --> 00:16.975
Why do these guys take a shot at me just
because I took some pictures of them?

00:17.051 --> 00:19.417
The point is two men
are trying to kill you.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.353
And they're gonna kill you, too,
and I'm not gonna let that happen.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.822
Where are they?

00:24.258 --> 00:26.726
You sent me into a situation
that could have got me killed.

01:38.501 --> 01:40.969
<i>One of the best
things about living in paradise...</i>

01:41.037 --> 01:42.937
<i>is that when you get
a couple of days off...</i>

01:43.005 --> 01:45.997
<i>you don't have to go someplace
else to have fun and relax.</i>

01:46.442 --> 01:50.970
<i>Instead, you can concentrate on some
of the finer things in life. Like art.</i>

01:51.380 --> 01:55.976
<i>It comes in many shapes, and forms and
textures. You can find it anywhere.</i>

01:56.352 --> 01:57.580
<i>Even in the sand.</i>

01:58.621 --> 02:01.055
<i>And no matter how old
or young you are...</i>

02:01.123 --> 02:03.284
<i>there's an incredible
feeling of pride...</i>

02:03.492 --> 02:06.427
<i>when you create something with
your own two hands.</i>

02:13.469 --> 02:16.199
No!
It's my castle.

02:16.372 --> 02:19.535
Yeah, but if you pour water,
aren't you gonna ru-

02:24.613 --> 02:25.841
All right, go ahead.

02:29.285 --> 02:31.549
Fix it.
What?

02:31.854 --> 02:33.014
Fix it.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.485
All right. All right.

02:36.559 --> 02:39.858
But you gotta promise you're
not gonna pour water on it again.

02:40.196 --> 02:44.132
Now go get me some wet sand. Way down
by the water. Way, way down there.

02:47.036 --> 02:51.268
If I get my own bucket and
shovel, can I play too, please?

02:51.874 --> 02:54.365
I am creating
a work of art here, Carol.

02:54.443 --> 02:57.241
I prefer not to be disturbed
by your juvenile behavior.

02:59.749 --> 03:01.910
Is it some kind of
detective's holiday?

03:02.551 --> 03:04.212
Charlie Chan's birthday.

03:05.755 --> 03:08.690
A little R and R after a tough ca.
- That's ruined.

03:11.327 --> 03:12.453
Who's the kid?

03:12.528 --> 03:15.156
Oh, that's Keoki's nephew.

03:15.398 --> 03:18.526
Keoki had to run an errand for Rick
so I promised him I'd watch him.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.966
Well, I just dropped by to tell
you not to drive for a while.

03:22.872 --> 03:25.170
What?
The police will probably stop you.

03:25.608 --> 03:27.542
Good luck
on your castle, Thomas.

03:27.610 --> 03:29.407
Wait. Wait a minute.

03:29.912 --> 03:31.504
Now, wait a minute, Carol.

03:32.648 --> 03:35.173
Why are the police
going to stop me?

03:35.251 --> 03:37.776
I don't know. Something about
unpaid tickets. Parking tickets.

03:37.853 --> 03:40.048
Wait! Wait. Wait.

03:40.823 --> 03:44.953
I don't have any parking tickets,
except the ones you fixed for me.

03:48.063 --> 03:51.521
You didn't fix them for me?
But I was helping you.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.933
I was working for the DA's office!
Yes, that's right, you were.

03:55.104 --> 03:58.767
Boy, did the DMV sure get ticked
off when they're six months overdue.

03:58.974 --> 04:01.442
You know what? They issued an
arrest warrant for you today.

04:01.577 --> 04:04.341
You were supposed to take
care of those a long time ago.

04:04.947 --> 04:06.642
Thomas, I, you know, I...

04:06.715 --> 04:10.276
I put them in my file and I forgot about
them. What can - I'm sorry. I really am.

04:10.386 --> 04:12.946
Sorry? If those have been
put away for six months...

04:13.022 --> 04:16.788
I mean, with late penalties,
that could be - $653.49.

04:16.858 --> 04:19.225
However, if you pay it
they'll drop the warrant.

04:19.295 --> 04:22.355
I don't have that kind of
money! You said you'd handle it.

04:22.431 --> 04:25.400
Now, you gotta. You promised.
I'm going to. I promise.

04:25.501 --> 04:28.436
It's just that the paperwork
could take me a long time...

04:28.504 --> 04:31.473
and I'm so tied up with this
case right now. What case?

04:32.007 --> 04:33.872
Oh, it's just a
little surveillance.

04:34.977 --> 04:37.343
Since when did you get
involved in surveillance?

04:37.746 --> 04:41.978
Well, it's kind of a special case. I
got a tip about a fencing operation...

04:42.051 --> 04:45.543
in a warehouse on Kaliawa, and
there may be somebody involved...

04:45.621 --> 04:48.317
who I tried to prosecute last
year. Let the police handle it.

04:48.390 --> 04:51.553
I did. By the time they get to
it, it'll be another two weeks.

04:51.694 --> 04:54.720
Apparently they don't take me too seriously,
so I'm gonna handle it myself.

04:54.797 --> 04:56.992
You see,
I just don't have the time.

04:58.901 --> 04:59.993
Gee, Carol...

05:00.603 --> 05:04.562
maybe if I handled your surveillance
you could handle my parking tickets?

05:06.675 --> 05:08.802
That's a good idea.

05:12.681 --> 05:14.148
Just simple surveillance?

05:14.817 --> 05:17.479
Very. Hey, it's just,
watching to see...

05:17.553 --> 05:19.043
who's running the operation.

05:19.522 --> 05:21.820
And you will take care of
my parking tickets?

05:22.191 --> 05:23.988
What are friends for?

05:28.831 --> 05:31.265
Thomas, you be careful.

05:32.468 --> 05:35.631
What's that supposed to
mean? Just be careful.

05:36.005 --> 05:39.998
It could be a little dangerous.
Carol, now wait a minute!

05:40.109 --> 05:42.043
In fact,
it might be a lot dangerous.

05:42.111 --> 05:43.874
You better be prepared
for the worst.

05:44.246 --> 05:45.474
Carol!

05:50.619 --> 05:52.086
No!

05:53.822 --> 05:55.949
<i>Most people think a
private investigator's life...</i>

05:56.025 --> 05:58.050
<i>is filled with danger
and excitement.</i>

05:58.594 --> 05:59.993
<i>Sometimes it is...</i>

06:00.396 --> 06:02.830
<i>but most of the time
it's about as dangerous...</i>

06:02.898 --> 06:05.765
<i>as watching Keoki's nephew
destroy a sandcastle.</i>

06:07.036 --> 06:08.162
<i>Take surveillance.</i>

06:08.637 --> 06:11.265
<i>It's one of the more boring
aspects of the job.</i>

06:11.707 --> 06:13.538
<i>Especially when nothing happens.</i>

06:13.642 --> 06:17.942
<i>I was starting to get the feeling that
Carol's source was either wrong or too late.</i>

06:23.419 --> 06:26.911
<i>Now, the trick of surveillance was
knowing when something was a dead end.</i>

06:27.056 --> 06:29.524
<i>And knowing just the right
time to call it a day.</i>

06:33.195 --> 06:35.060
<i>Then again,
it pays to be patient.</i>

06:51.714 --> 06:53.375
I think we got a problem here.

07:21.910 --> 07:23.673
<i>I've always
tried to keep my temper...</i>

07:23.746 --> 07:25.646
<i>especially when it comes
to business.</i>

07:25.948 --> 07:30.544
<i>But some things you just can't ignore.
Those guys had demolished my camera...</i>

07:30.619 --> 07:32.211
<i>and missed my head by inches.</i>

07:34.456 --> 07:35.650
<i>I was mad.</i>

07:39.928 --> 07:42.453
<i>But what the
hell, it was only a camera.</i>

07:42.698 --> 07:45.394
<i>And maybe these guys were
just trying to scare me off.</i>

08:02.384 --> 08:05.478
<i>When I write my book on being a
first-class private investigator...</i>

08:05.554 --> 08:08.079
<i>rule number 168 is going to be:</i>

08:08.624 --> 08:11.684
<i>If you're getting chased,
you should be in a fast car.</i>

08:20.169 --> 08:22.330
<i>Postscript to rule 168:</i>

08:22.471 --> 08:26.271
<i>No matter how fast your car is, there
can always be one that's faster.</i>

08:52.434 --> 08:54.231
<i>No matter how much
I want to deny it...</i>

08:54.303 --> 08:56.999
<i>there's something exhilarating
about a confrontation.</i>

08:57.072 --> 08:59.336
<i>Especially when you know
you're in the right.</i>

08:59.608 --> 09:02.236
<i>And especially
when you're prepared.</i>

09:49.892 --> 09:51.382
<i>I'm sorry, Thomas.</i>

09:51.593 --> 09:53.424
And I did try to get you
released sooner...

09:53.495 --> 09:55.725
but when a shooting's involved,
they have all these reports-

09:55.798 --> 09:57.561
What about my
investigator's license?

09:57.633 --> 10:00.067
I'm going to do everything I
can to keep them from pulling it.

10:00.135 --> 10:02.194
Like you told me
how dangerous this was?

10:02.271 --> 10:04.739
I told you it might-
You didn't tell me enough.

10:04.807 --> 10:07.674
You sent me into a situation
that could have got me killed.

10:07.743 --> 10:09.142
Or somebody else.

10:10.078 --> 10:11.238
I'm sorry.

10:11.547 --> 10:14.914
That makes it okay? You're sorry?
Well, tell that to Emily Jackson.

10:25.727 --> 10:30.357
<i>Dr. Gray to
ICU stat. Dr. Gray to ICU stat.</i>

10:30.632 --> 10:32.327
Doctor?
What can I do for you?

10:32.801 --> 10:34.962
I wondered how
Emily Jackson's doing.

10:35.437 --> 10:36.563
You a relative?

10:36.805 --> 10:39.831
Medical information can be given only
to members of the immediate family.

10:39.908 --> 10:41.170
I'm her brother.

10:41.643 --> 10:44.771
Most of her injuries are minor.
They'll clear up in a few days.

10:44.947 --> 10:47.745
But one of them
has us concerned. Her legs.

10:48.383 --> 10:49.873
She has no feeling in them.

10:50.752 --> 10:52.583
Now, I've called in
a specialist.

10:54.089 --> 10:56.114
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this...

10:56.225 --> 10:58.591
but I'm afraid your sister
may never walk again.

10:59.995 --> 11:01.257
Excuse me.

11:13.208 --> 11:14.937
<i>No matter how hard I tried...</i>

11:15.210 --> 11:17.804
<i>there were two phrases
I couldn't get out of my mind.</i>

11:18.013 --> 11:19.503
<i>"Especially when
you're right."</i>

11:19.581 --> 11:21.208
<i>"Especially when
you're prepared."</i>

11:21.717 --> 11:26.177
<i>If I hadn't been s</i> o <i>"prepared," Emily
Jackson wouldn't be in the hospital.</i>

11:51.446 --> 11:52.879
Good morning, Magnum.

11:58.020 --> 12:00.386
Here's Robin's camera,
Higgins. It's ruined.

12:00.555 --> 12:02.887
Save the speeches.
I've heard them before.

12:03.292 --> 12:05.260
Cameras can be replaced.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.727
Carol called me this morning.

12:10.933 --> 12:14.425
I simply came by to see if
I could be of any assistance.

12:15.971 --> 12:18.701
May I have a
cup of coffee, Magnum?

12:20.842 --> 12:23.140
A similar incident happened
to me, you know.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.348
It was during the
North African campaign.

12:29.484 --> 12:32.317
It was one of the darkest
nights I can ever remember.

12:32.955 --> 12:36.857
I was on sentry when I heard someone
screaming and running toward me.

12:37.459 --> 12:40.087
As was my duty,
I shouted "halt".

12:41.163 --> 12:45.827
I couldn't see a bloody thing and I
couldn't risk a charge on the camp.

12:46.768 --> 12:48.429
I was forced to fire.

12:49.805 --> 12:52.865
When he fell, the light from
our camp finally illuminated him.

12:54.076 --> 12:56.442
He was a British soldier
from another regiment.

12:58.647 --> 13:01.673
Magnum, where are you
going? To the hospital.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.122
I wasn't finished.

13:19.368 --> 13:21.768
Hi.
How's it going?

13:26.208 --> 13:27.505
Did I wake you?

13:27.576 --> 13:30.875
No. The nurses pump so much
dope into me all the time...

13:30.946 --> 13:33.278
I don't know when I'm
awake and when I'm dozing.

13:33.448 --> 13:35.780
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

13:37.085 --> 13:39.144
Think you could talk
to them about that?

13:39.955 --> 13:41.422
Yeah. I guess so.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.449
Where's your badge
and white coat?

13:47.195 --> 13:49.686
I know Gonzo on <i>Trapper John</i>
dresses like that,

13:49.765 --> 13:51.596
but I thought
that was only on the tube.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.198
Yeah. I think so.

13:55.337 --> 13:57.999
So, how am I doing, Doc.
Getting any better?

13:58.640 --> 13:59.664
I-

13:59.741 --> 14:00.969
That bad, huh?

14:02.044 --> 14:05.309
No, you're fine.
Well, you're gonna be fine.

14:09.718 --> 14:10.912
I gotta go.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.517
Wait. Aren't you even going-

14:31.773 --> 14:33.400
Well, how's it going, Thomas?

14:38.246 --> 14:39.577
I love baseball.

14:40.849 --> 14:41.838
Listen...

14:42.517 --> 14:45.179
I heard about the accident.
It made the six o'clock news.

14:45.253 --> 14:47.016
When I was 10 years old...

14:47.389 --> 14:49.584
my aunt Margaret took me
to a Tiger game.

14:49.724 --> 14:52.420
Thomas, listen, we know
how you feel. Was I 11?

14:53.328 --> 14:58.265
No, I was definitely 10 years old
because it was August of 1956...

14:59.301 --> 15:01.633
and the Tigers were still
in the pennant race.

15:01.703 --> 15:03.534
That's real nice. Thomas-

15:03.605 --> 15:05.334
It got to be the ninth inning...

15:05.407 --> 15:08.433
and the Tigers were down 4-0,
there were two outs.

15:08.510 --> 15:11.638
There was a man on first and second
and Harvey Kuenn was up and...

15:12.314 --> 15:15.909
Bullet Bob Turley was on
the mound, just throwing BBs.

15:17.285 --> 15:19.776
Well, Harvey lined
a single through the hole.

15:21.923 --> 15:24.414
You know, there's nothing
like the sound of a clean hit.

15:25.127 --> 15:27.789
Thomas - There's just no
other sound like it. It's...

15:29.498 --> 15:31.193
poetry.
Thomas-

15:31.266 --> 15:33.564
That scored a run and it
brought up Al Kaline.

15:33.635 --> 15:36.035
Well, the crowd's going crazy
and I dropped my snow cone...

15:36.104 --> 15:38.766
down the back of the guy in
front of me, and Bullet Bob...

15:38.840 --> 15:41.741
he rears back and he throws
one right by Al's head.

15:42.244 --> 15:43.677
Well, it seemed like...

15:44.646 --> 15:47.774
I don't know, 10 minutes before
Al finally picked himself up.

15:48.450 --> 15:49.644
And he digs in...

15:50.585 --> 15:52.553
and Turley is just...

15:53.488 --> 15:54.819
looking at him.

15:56.124 --> 15:58.991
And then he lets go with
another high, inside fastball.

15:59.227 --> 16:00.524
Hey, Thomas!

16:00.962 --> 16:04.022
Hey, Thomas, I've been looking
for you. Yeah, so what happened?

16:04.099 --> 16:06.659
I got the pictures developed.
What pictures?

16:06.902 --> 16:11.532
No, what happened to Al? Not
Al. Jimmy and Mark Kiedash.

16:11.673 --> 16:13.903
Hey, I heard about
those guys. Pretty rough.

16:14.409 --> 16:18.539
Thomas, what happened to Al
Kaline? Did he win the game?

16:20.248 --> 16:21.272
Huh?

16:21.349 --> 16:22.338
The game?

16:24.319 --> 16:26.685
Al stroked one inside
the line. The Tigers won.

16:28.256 --> 16:32.090
Thomas, I had no idea that the guys in
that warehouse were the Kiedash brothers.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.958
I thought they were in prison.
They got out a year ago.

16:35.397 --> 16:36.830
Come on, have a seat.

16:39.901 --> 16:41.732
What were they in for?

16:42.771 --> 16:46.400
They beat a man to death
with a bumper of a '51 DeSoto.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.404
Why were they out of jail?

16:49.644 --> 16:52.204
Because they served their
time. What there was of it.

16:53.348 --> 16:55.145
Believe me, Thomas,
I didn't know.

16:55.217 --> 16:58.482
I thought that the guy that I sent
you to watch was Ozzie Franklin.

16:58.653 --> 17:00.985
He's a small-time fencer
of stolen cars.

17:01.189 --> 17:03.214
But these guys, they're into
a whole new line of work.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.281
They rip off computer secrets.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.988
These guys don't sound
exactly like the computer type.

17:08.096 --> 17:09.188
They aren't.

17:09.931 --> 17:12.422
They go to computer companies
and they muscle technicians...

17:12.534 --> 17:14.798
into handing over secrets
and then they sell them.

17:14.868 --> 17:18.430
We think to the Japanese. But up until
now, we didn't know much about them.

17:19.107 --> 17:23.009
So you see, finding them at that
warehouse, that was just dumb luck.

17:26.481 --> 17:27.709
It was bad luck.

17:31.119 --> 17:33.053
I know somebody
who'd agree with you.

17:35.557 --> 17:38.685
Well, now that I know who we're dealing
with, I can get the police involved.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.955
I'm gonna start working
on a court order.

17:41.129 --> 17:43.029
Hey, Thomas,
where are you going?

17:44.833 --> 17:47.131
<i>One of the best
things about having friends...</i>

17:47.402 --> 17:50.371
<i>is that you've got someone to
talk to when you're in trouble.</i>

17:50.839 --> 17:53.535
<i>You don't even have to talk
about what you're talking about.</i>

17:53.608 --> 17:55.166
<i>If you know what I mean.</i>

17:55.243 --> 17:58.178
<i>Now, I don't know why I was
thinking about baseball...</i>

17:58.780 --> 17:59.974
<i>but I do know...</i>

18:00.181 --> 18:04.140
<i>that I'd forgotten the lesson Al
Kaline had taught me back in 1956.</i>

18:05.019 --> 18:07.817
<i>Pick yourself up,
brush yourself off...</i>

18:08.623 --> 18:10.181
<i>and get back in the box.</i>

18:10.258 --> 18:11.247
Hi.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.487
I noticed you didn't have
any flowers, so I...

18:22.303 --> 18:24.134
You're not a doctor, are you?

18:31.212 --> 18:32.406
No, I'm not.

18:33.348 --> 18:35.213
Then who are you?
What do you want?

18:35.683 --> 18:37.651
A friend. I hope.

18:38.653 --> 18:40.712
Look, they may keep me
doped up around here,

18:40.789 --> 18:43.883
but I can still recognize my
friends and I don't know you.

18:45.393 --> 18:46.690
But that's all right.

18:48.863 --> 18:52.094
You're the only visitor I've had,
so I guess I can't be choosey.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.135
I'm the one who shot your car.

18:57.205 --> 18:59.298
And you're here in my room?

19:02.143 --> 19:04.634
You know that
I can't move my legs, mister?

19:04.712 --> 19:05.701
Yes.

19:07.582 --> 19:09.447
You here to
ease your conscience?

19:09.584 --> 19:12.246
No, I just wanted to know
how you were feeling.

19:13.788 --> 19:14.777
Get out.

19:15.323 --> 19:16.756
I want to help.

19:17.091 --> 19:19.992
I don't want your help!
And I don't...

19:20.962 --> 19:24.523
Just take your flowers and your
phony guilt and get out of here!

19:25.834 --> 19:29.395
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

19:30.271 --> 19:34.503
Will you go!
Stop looking at me!

19:41.483 --> 19:42.916
I hate you!

19:52.694 --> 19:54.719
My Lord, what happened?

19:58.700 --> 20:00.497
It's nothing.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
I'm sorry.

20:05.974 --> 20:08.272
Well, your guest will
have to leave.

20:13.448 --> 20:15.348
I'm sorry.
I really...

20:19.954 --> 20:21.581
Can I get you anything?

20:27.795 --> 20:31.526
I'd kill for a television set
and a pack of cigarettes.

20:47.882 --> 20:50.316
<i>I wasn't sure why
I went back to the hospital.</i>

20:50.885 --> 20:53.251
<i>Except that maybe
Emily was right.</i>

20:53.821 --> 20:55.982
<i>Maybe it was to
ease my conscience.</i>

20:56.658 --> 21:00.219
<i>But once I was there,
I know why I stayed.</i>

21:00.862 --> 21:02.693
<i>There was just
something about her.</i>

21:03.264 --> 21:06.324
<i>I guess it was her refusal to
feel sorry for herself...</i>

21:06.401 --> 21:08.028
<i>that made me
want to stick around.</i>

21:08.102 --> 21:10.764
So Ruby says to me, "You get one
more customer asking for you..."

21:10.838 --> 21:13.739
I'm going to have to change the
name to Emily's Beauty Emporium."

21:13.808 --> 21:17.209
Oh, yeah? You must be pretty
good. Best there was in Saginaw.

21:18.513 --> 21:20.413
Guess that ain't saying
a whole lot.

21:23.918 --> 21:26.443
What?
I don't know.

21:27.956 --> 21:30.584
It just hit me, I can't
be a beautician no more.

21:33.261 --> 21:37.027
But, hey, we got to have a positive
attitude. I'll walk again, right?

21:37.231 --> 21:38.220
Right.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.692
And if I don't, what the hell, I'll
just sue you for a couple of million.

21:45.740 --> 21:47.105
I'm only joking.

21:50.845 --> 21:53.177
Visiting hours were over
a long time ago.

21:54.816 --> 21:57.649
Right. I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

21:57.852 --> 22:00.320
Promise?
I promise.

22:01.789 --> 22:03.586
Listen, if it's not
too far out of your way...

22:03.658 --> 22:07.094
could you bring me some Yellow
Zonkers and a couple of Yankee Doodles?

22:07.295 --> 22:11.129
What are they? No, never
mind. I'll find them.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.024
<i>Do you want
to continue for $500?</i>

22:14.102 --> 22:15.660
<i>Okay.</i>

22:16.537 --> 22:17.765
<i>Question number two-</i>

22:28.516 --> 22:30.450
Doctor?
Yeah?

22:30.652 --> 22:33.780
How's Emily doing? Oh, her minor
injuries are healing nicely.

22:33.921 --> 22:36.116
But still no feeling
in her legs.

22:36.691 --> 22:38.283
What did the specialist say?

22:38.426 --> 22:40.223
Medically,
nothing seems to be wrong.

22:40.294 --> 22:42.558
But that's often the case
with spinal injuries.

22:42.630 --> 22:44.530
There can be trauma
we can't detect.

22:44.999 --> 22:47.627
But there's a chance that
she could get better?

22:47.735 --> 22:49.259
Hey, never give up hope.

22:49.570 --> 22:52.266
We'll get her into therapy
so her muscles don't weaken.

22:52.573 --> 22:54.905
Look, if there's anything
I can do to help.

22:54.976 --> 22:57.467
Well, I don't think Emily
needs the hospital anymore.

22:57.545 --> 23:00.105
Actually, the best thing for
your sister is to get out of here.

23:00.214 --> 23:02.045
But she needs care and therapy.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.808
It will take a lot of hard work.

23:03.885 --> 23:07.480
But mentally... Mentally, the
benefits will be tremendous.

23:08.423 --> 23:10.687
You think you and your family
can handle that?

23:39.754 --> 23:41.381
That's pretty good, Higgins.

23:42.590 --> 23:44.490
How long have you been
standing there?

23:44.726 --> 23:46.626
About 16 bars.

23:48.696 --> 23:49.958
What do you want?

23:50.798 --> 23:54.290
I have a favor to ask.
It's...

23:55.536 --> 23:59.131
It's a big favor.
But it means a lot to me,

23:59.207 --> 24:04.076
and I want you to consider it
very sincerely before you answer.

24:04.345 --> 24:05.437
Emily...

24:06.581 --> 24:07.980
the girl in the accident...

24:08.049 --> 24:13.009
is being released from the
hospital in a couple of days...

24:14.322 --> 24:18.554
and I want to move her
here to the estate.

24:20.061 --> 24:21.756
She can't walk, Higgins.

24:23.264 --> 24:26.199
And she needs therapy and
someone to take care of her.

24:26.267 --> 24:29.202
It's quite all right. She
doesn't have anyone else.

24:29.270 --> 24:30.703
Her parents are dead.

24:32.640 --> 24:36.667
She doesn't have any friends on
the island. She's just all alone.

24:36.778 --> 24:38.871
Magnum, I said
it's quite all right.

24:40.948 --> 24:45.214
I'll fix up a room on the first floor
so she won't have to worry about stairs.

24:49.090 --> 24:50.614
Just one question.

24:52.260 --> 24:56.663
Are you doing this to help
the young lady or yourself?

25:03.638 --> 25:05.071
Both, I guess.

25:07.141 --> 25:09.006
I suggest
you be careful, Magnum.

25:10.645 --> 25:12.772
Don't get too caught up
in all this.

25:18.085 --> 25:19.609
Higgins, the...

25:21.823 --> 25:25.486
story you were telling me about
the British soldier that you shot...

25:27.862 --> 25:29.329
was that a real one?

25:34.902 --> 25:36.767
His name was Roger Thornby.

25:38.706 --> 25:41.732
Just a poor chap who couldn't
stand the days of waiting...

25:42.410 --> 25:44.503
while bombs flew over his head.

25:52.753 --> 25:53.947
And I killed him.

26:05.666 --> 26:07.566
I never forgave myself.

26:16.544 --> 26:18.011
He had a family.

26:19.714 --> 26:22.911
When I returned home,
I went to see them.

26:24.218 --> 26:28.314
He had a wife and
young Roger, Jr.

26:30.558 --> 26:32.856
I started going
to see them every day.

26:33.794 --> 26:35.728
Making sure
they had enough to eat.

26:36.264 --> 26:38.357
Doing chores
that needed to be done.

26:40.468 --> 26:44.234
I was trying to replace
the life I took with my own.

26:45.172 --> 26:46.764
Well, that's understandable.

26:46.841 --> 26:50.333
Quite.
Or so I thought at the time.

26:52.513 --> 26:55.107
But I eventually came
to realize that...

26:55.783 --> 26:59.583
I was doing it more for myself
than for them.

27:00.655 --> 27:04.182
I became more of a burden
than a help. A reminder.

27:06.093 --> 27:07.754
A painful reminder.

27:09.397 --> 27:13.800
So, finally I left
and never saw them again.

27:15.937 --> 27:18.838
I continued to send
what money I could.

27:19.974 --> 27:23.205
And only stopped
a few years ago...

27:24.378 --> 27:26.869
when Thornby's son
finished university.

27:33.487 --> 27:35.887
I'm going where?
Robin Masters' estate.

27:35.957 --> 27:38.755
That way I can be sure you're taken
care of and help you with your therapy.

27:38.826 --> 27:40.259
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

27:40.861 --> 27:42.852
What's the matter?
I hardly know you.

27:42.930 --> 27:46.297
I mean, what if you're some weirdo and
you take me to this creepy old estate...

27:46.367 --> 27:48.562
and turn me into
your prisoner or slave?

27:48.636 --> 27:51.002
Emily, I think you've been
watching too much television.

27:51.072 --> 27:54.303
You're going to live in the main house
with this nurse we hired and Higgins.

27:54.375 --> 27:57.208
I live in the guest house.
Who's this Higgins guy?

27:57.278 --> 28:00.338
Well, he sort of runs the
place. He's a nice guy.

28:01.649 --> 28:03.879
Well, I mean, sometimes he
yells too much, but, well see...

28:03.951 --> 28:06.579
he and I have had our
differences, but basically...

28:07.188 --> 28:11.090
The important thing is that he's always
gracious to his guests. You'll like him.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.119
Let me see your face.

28:16.764 --> 28:17.753
What?

28:17.898 --> 28:19.763
I'm a face interpreter.
It's sort of a hobby.

28:19.867 --> 28:22.358
I can see if someone's
telling the truth. Come here.

28:30.478 --> 28:33.208
This used to drive them crazy
at Ruby's Beauty Emporium.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.542
I'll bet.

28:35.516 --> 28:37.780
Okay, you're telling the truth.

28:40.388 --> 28:41.719
Here we are.

28:42.023 --> 28:45.550
Look at this car. I could
die. I could really die.

28:47.595 --> 28:48.789
There we go.

28:49.096 --> 28:51.360
Now, be careful. Is an
estate the same as a mansion?

28:52.133 --> 28:53.998
Kinda. Watch it.

28:55.970 --> 28:57.938
There you are.
You comfortable?

28:58.072 --> 28:59.835
You bet.
Good.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.376
Thank you.
Thanks.

29:08.282 --> 29:10.716
I guess your car was
totaled, huh? My car?

29:11.185 --> 29:14.245
Oh, that wasn't my car.
I borrowed it from a neighbor.

29:14.321 --> 29:16.152
It's a good thing
he had insurance.

29:45.953 --> 29:48.649
Come on, man, move it!
Get that thing outta the way!

29:51.125 --> 29:52.353
Get it out of here!

29:56.190 --> 29:57.384
Can we get out now?

29:58.182 --> 30:02.619
The doctor said one hour
of exercise in warm water.

30:02.854 --> 30:05.914
I think he meant in a Jacuzzi.
Aren't there sharks in here?

30:06.023 --> 30:07.047
No.

30:07.358 --> 30:10.657
I was really bored one day,
so I watched a documentary.

30:10.728 --> 30:13.754
It was about how sharks are attracted
to certain kind of movements...

30:13.931 --> 30:18.027
and Thomas, I'm moving
just like a wounded seal.

30:19.070 --> 30:20.059
Well...

30:20.404 --> 30:23.805
I don't think the sharks around Oahu
are used to seeing any kind of seals.

30:23.908 --> 30:25.705
Besides, there's a great,
big reef out there.

30:25.777 --> 30:29.144
And this tidal pool was built a
long time ago to keep sharks out...

30:29.313 --> 30:30.712
and sea turtles in.

30:30.782 --> 30:33.410
The local people used to
raise them for food in here.

30:34.252 --> 30:36.220
Thomas.
What?

30:36.387 --> 30:38.287
You got a girlfriend
or anything?

30:39.490 --> 30:40.479
No.

30:41.425 --> 30:44.917
Well, don't give up women
on my account.

30:45.163 --> 30:48.860
It's not right you spending all your time
with me just 'cause you feel sorry for me.

30:48.933 --> 30:51.800
I don't feel sorry for you.
I like spending time with you.

30:52.570 --> 30:54.333
You think I'll ever walk again?

30:54.906 --> 30:55.895
Sure.

30:56.607 --> 31:00.008
No, I mean really-deep-down-
in-your-heart believe?

31:02.079 --> 31:03.910
And I want your face
for this one.

31:04.081 --> 31:07.278
Oh, come on, Emily.
Let me have it.

31:07.351 --> 31:10.252
I told you I believe you'd
walk again. I want the truth.

31:10.321 --> 31:12.755
I think you've had
enough therapy for one day.

31:13.191 --> 31:14.249
Thomas.

31:26.904 --> 31:29.134
I really believe
you'll walk again.

31:32.210 --> 31:35.043
I see hope.
Lots of it.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.141
But you have your doubts.

31:38.950 --> 31:41.077
Come in, you two!

31:41.853 --> 31:43.582
Lunch is ready!

31:46.257 --> 31:48.487
It's all right, Thomas.
Hope's good enough.

31:51.996 --> 31:53.258
All right, let's go.

31:53.364 --> 31:54.763
Here we go.

31:59.904 --> 32:02.600
You really didn't have to go to
all this trouble, Mr. Higgins.

32:02.673 --> 32:06.074
Thomas and I could have picked up some
burger and fries on the way to the hospital.

32:06.143 --> 32:10.079
Burgers and fries are hardly satisfactory
nutrition for someone who's recuperating.

32:12.617 --> 32:15.381
How do you really feel about
me being here, Mr. Higgins?

32:16.854 --> 32:20.221
Well, it certainly cuts the sting
out of having to live with Magnum.

32:21.659 --> 32:23.286
Does that mean you don't mind?

32:23.928 --> 32:24.917
Yes.

32:25.696 --> 32:27.561
Come here.
What?

32:27.698 --> 32:29.791
She wants to read your face.

32:30.401 --> 32:31.698
I beg your pardon?

32:32.570 --> 32:36.438
It's kind of like a lie detector,
and she's pretty good at it.

32:41.012 --> 32:42.104
My God.

32:46.784 --> 32:50.618
Thanks, Mr. Higgins. I just wanted to
make sure I wasn't a burden on anyone.

33:12.877 --> 33:15.869
Emily, get down.
What's happening?

33:15.947 --> 33:17.881
Just stay down and hold on.

33:56.654 --> 33:57.916
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

33:57.989 --> 34:01.049
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to
do, Higgins, but you don't understand.

34:01.125 --> 34:03.116
You couldn't possibly have
known they were after you.

34:03.194 --> 34:04.821
That's not the point.

34:04.895 --> 34:08.331
The point is that, no matter
what you say or what I say,

34:08.399 --> 34:11.994
if I hadn't lost my temper that girl
wouldn't be sitting in a room right now...

34:12.069 --> 34:13.661
watching TV from a wheelchair.

34:19.744 --> 34:21.177
Yes? <i>Thomas?</i>

34:21.312 --> 34:22.677
Come on in, Carol.

34:22.746 --> 34:26.239
Magnum, your attitude is admirable,
but perhaps ill-considered.

34:26.617 --> 34:29.984
Be that as it may, the point is
two men are trying to kill you.

34:30.388 --> 34:33.755
You don't do yourself or Emily any
good if you don't protect yourself.

34:34.025 --> 34:38.018
You must consider keeping a
gun with you. I put that away.

34:38.696 --> 34:42.188
I got here as soon as I
could. You got the pictures?

34:42.565 --> 34:46.297
It's nice to see you, too,
Thomas. How are you, Jonathan?

34:47.772 --> 34:49.170
This just keeps bugging me.

34:49.239 --> 34:52.937
Why do these guys take a shot at me just
because I took some pictures of them?

34:53.010 --> 34:55.808
Camera shy?
Very funny.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.913
Perhaps you photographed
something they don't want seen.

34:58.983 --> 35:00.280
Like what?

35:01.018 --> 35:03.851
Maybe this is something.
There's a logo on the briefcase.

35:04.522 --> 35:06.080
And some initials.

35:07.358 --> 35:10.327
Y. K.
May I see it?

35:16.534 --> 35:19.332
That's the logo of
the Ikeguchi Corporation.

35:19.870 --> 35:21.770
A Japanese electronics firm.

35:22.506 --> 35:25.407
Yoshio Kawatormari.
What?

35:25.810 --> 35:26.799
Y.K.

35:27.011 --> 35:29.206
He's the vice president of
the Ikeguchi Corporation.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.147
At least he was until he turned
up dead here two weeks ago.

35:32.316 --> 35:35.012
And the Kiedash brothers
inherited his briefcase.

35:35.386 --> 35:37.911
He must have been buying computer
secrets from the brothers...

35:37.988 --> 35:39.785
and the deal went sour
and they killed him.

35:39.857 --> 35:41.449
That's why they're after you.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.559
I gotta get these to the police.

35:44.562 --> 35:46.462
I'll walk you to the door.

35:51.235 --> 35:52.259
Carol.

35:52.336 --> 35:53.325
Hmm?

35:53.404 --> 35:55.304
About the last few days.

35:55.506 --> 35:57.497
Oh no, I deserved it.

35:57.575 --> 36:00.510
I was wrong. It was my.
- No, I was upset...

36:00.578 --> 36:02.978
and I'm afraid
I took it out on you.

36:03.047 --> 36:06.278
No, I should have given you
more information, I was wrong.

36:06.350 --> 36:07.908
It was my-
Carol, please?

36:08.752 --> 36:10.344
Could you at least
let me apologize?

36:10.421 --> 36:12.616
Do you always
have to have the last word?

36:13.290 --> 36:14.814
Me?
Yes.

36:15.092 --> 36:17.026
Do you know that you-

36:23.400 --> 36:26.858
I accept your apology,
Thomas. Thank you.

36:28.105 --> 36:31.040
But it really was my fault.
Good night.

36:35.412 --> 36:36.401
Thomas.

36:37.581 --> 36:39.879
Emily. What are you doing up?

36:41.385 --> 36:44.752
I'm worried about you. Especially
after what happened this afternoon.

36:44.955 --> 36:46.422
This is what I do for a living.

36:46.490 --> 36:49.584
If you're thinking about going after
those guys because of what happened to me.

36:49.660 --> 36:52.686
Don't, please. I don't
want revenge. I'm out of it.

36:52.763 --> 36:54.890
The police are gonna handle
it. Now, you better get to bed.

36:54.965 --> 36:58.025
We got a lot of work to do
tomorrow. Give me your face, Thomas.

37:00.604 --> 37:03.937
Emily. Please, I really need to see it.

37:10.648 --> 37:13.811
Thomas, how do you
really feel about me?

37:14.185 --> 37:15.743
I like you.

37:17.521 --> 37:19.216
Could you ever...

37:20.191 --> 37:23.456
I mean, if all this hadn't happened
and we had met somewhere else,

37:23.594 --> 37:26.427
do you think you would have
wanted to spend time with me?

37:27.531 --> 37:28.520
Sure.

37:36.106 --> 37:37.937
Thanks, Thomas, for everything.

37:40.044 --> 37:43.013
Right, I'll see you tomorrow
morning, eight o'clock.

37:43.314 --> 37:47.375
Feeding time for the sharks,
right? Right. Good night.

38:00.197 --> 38:01.562
Morning, Higgins.

38:03.234 --> 38:05.668
She's gone.
She left at six this morning.

38:06.637 --> 38:07.729
What?

38:08.606 --> 38:09.595
How?

38:10.040 --> 38:12.668
I helped the taxi driver
lift her into the car.

38:13.777 --> 38:16.803
And you didn't tell me?
She asked me not to.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.246
Actually, begged would be a
better description.

38:19.883 --> 38:23.114
Magnum, wait.
Don't go after her.

38:25.956 --> 38:27.048
You had no right.

38:27.157 --> 38:29.125
I think she left because
she's in love with you...

38:29.193 --> 38:30.854
and feared
you didn't feel the same way.

38:30.928 --> 38:33.226
Did she say that? No, I just
presumed from what she said-

38:33.297 --> 38:35.891
Don't presume, Higgins. You can't
replace what Emily has lost...

38:35.966 --> 38:38.298
with your life. She has
to go out on her own now.

38:38.369 --> 38:40.394
Think of Emily, Magnum,
not yourself.

38:47.945 --> 38:50.072
<i>I guess nobody likes
to think of themselves...</i>

38:50.147 --> 38:52.308
<i>as selfish or self-centered.</i>

38:52.783 --> 38:56.412
<i>I know, ever since the accident,
I believed I was only concerned about Emily.</i>

38:57.087 --> 39:00.420
<i>But what Higgins had said
brought the truth home to me.</i>

39:01.058 --> 39:03.253
<i>I'd been thinking
only about myself.</i>

39:04.428 --> 39:07.090
<i>I hadn't even bothered to
ask Emily where she lived.</i>

39:08.165 --> 39:10.292
She lives on Waiaka Road.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.502
You work fast.
I found out this morning.

39:14.571 --> 39:16.402
Along with some
other information.

39:16.907 --> 39:19.671
The car that Emily was driving
when she had the accident...

39:20.044 --> 39:21.033
Yeah?

39:21.345 --> 39:23.779
She borrowed it
from the Kiedash brothers.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.085
<i>My dad once told me...</i>

39:33.156 --> 39:36.319
<i>there's a connection
between people called trust.</i>

39:37.027 --> 39:38.790
<i>That no matter
how bad things get...</i>

39:38.862 --> 39:41.456
<i>you can count on that
connection to pull you through.</i>

39:41.698 --> 39:45.634
<i>What he didn't tell me was that when
someone you care about lies to you...</i>

39:46.003 --> 39:48.528
<i>that connection
is very painfully broken.</i>

39:49.306 --> 39:51.797
<i>I didn't want to lose
that connection with Emily.</i>

39:51.875 --> 39:54.708
<i>I was ready to accept almost
any explanation from her.</i>

39:59.716 --> 40:02.344
<i>Until I saw how complete
her lie really was.</i>

40:05.522 --> 40:07.649
You could walk all along,
couldn't you?

40:08.458 --> 40:10.255
So, big deal.
A lot of people do.

40:15.332 --> 40:17.095
You lied to me.
Sorry.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.635
That's not good enough.
Well, it'll have to do.

40:19.703 --> 40:23.696
I don't have to justify anything to
you. I mean, what do you know, anyway?

40:24.074 --> 40:28.340
You ever eat in soup kitchens,
sleep in bus stations? No.

40:28.612 --> 40:32.378
You sleep in a big estate and you eat
fancy foods with names nobody can even say.

40:32.449 --> 40:34.849
So just leave me alone.
This isn't you.

40:35.252 --> 40:37.220
Yeah, well, then who is it? Emily.

40:37.421 --> 40:39.946
Look at me!
Look at me!

40:45.529 --> 40:46.894
They beat you up.

40:47.631 --> 40:49.997
Don't you get it?
They were after me, not you.

40:50.167 --> 40:52.727
They would've killed me, except
they need me to get to you.

40:52.803 --> 40:55.271
What are you talking about? They
wanted me to call you at six.

40:55.339 --> 40:58.706
Tell you I was in trouble. When you came
they were gonna be here waiting for you.

40:58.875 --> 41:02.402
So where were you going? To the
police station, then the airport.

41:02.579 --> 41:05.878
I thought I'd come clean with the cops
and get the hell out of this paradise.

41:05.949 --> 41:07.143
Where are they?

41:08.318 --> 41:10.115
I don't know.
The hell you don't.

41:10.187 --> 41:12.212
You were working for them.
I just ran errands.

41:12.289 --> 41:14.917
I was just lookout once
in a while. Where are they?

41:15.192 --> 41:18.059
I don't want to tell you,
okay? You'll get hurt.

41:18.161 --> 41:19.628
Just let the police handle it.

41:19.696 --> 41:21.664
There's no time for that.
Look, Emily.

41:23.033 --> 41:25.729
They're gonna kill you, too, and
I am not gonna let that happen.

41:25.802 --> 41:27.201
Where are they?

41:36.513 --> 41:37.775
Thomas.

41:38.982 --> 41:41.610
You may find this
hard to understand, but...

41:45.622 --> 41:47.886
no guy ever treated me
like you did.

41:50.494 --> 41:51.825
You took care of me.

41:51.895 --> 41:55.422
You answered my dumb questions
without making fun.

41:58.268 --> 42:00.793
God, you have the best face
I ever read.

42:02.472 --> 42:03.700
I didn't lie to you.

42:04.708 --> 42:08.371
I didn't get the feeling back in
my legs until we got to the estate.

42:10.213 --> 42:11.976
I was just so afraid.

42:13.450 --> 42:16.283
If you thought that I was
getting better that you would...

42:17.554 --> 42:19.886
you'd send me away.
I'd never see you again.

42:26.897 --> 42:28.421
Oh, Emily.

42:31.201 --> 42:35.035
I mean, if you got better I
wouldn't stop caring for you.

42:36.306 --> 42:37.830
I'd still be your friend.

42:41.845 --> 42:43.472
You believe me?

42:45.949 --> 42:46.938
I do.

42:48.485 --> 42:50.112
Where are they?

42:57.160 --> 42:59.890
<i>A person makes
a 100 decisions every day.</i>

42:59.963 --> 43:02.056
<i>Some you think about,
some you don't.</i>

43:02.999 --> 43:05.160
<i>And then there's
the one you agonize over.</i>

43:32.729 --> 43:34.219
Do what I
tell you, or something.

43:34.297 --> 43:35.389
But she didn't do it.

43:35.465 --> 43:36.955
So I belted her again.

43:49.980 --> 43:51.413
Guys, get down.

43:54.651 --> 43:56.881
Jim. Mark!
Hey!

44:29.152 --> 44:30.847
Come on, let's get out of here!

45:13.930 --> 45:15.955
Thanks, Mr. Higgins,
for everything.

45:16.633 --> 45:18.965
I'm gonna miss you.
And I you.

45:27.677 --> 45:31.010
And as soon as you finish writing
your memoirs, send me a copy.

45:31.414 --> 45:33.905
Just can't get enough
of those stories.

45:35.085 --> 45:36.985
I'll send you Magnum's copy.

45:40.457 --> 45:41.583
Good-bye.

45:46.763 --> 45:49.027
You're really lucky
to have a friend like that.

45:49.432 --> 45:52.890
I saw on this soap once where this guy.
- You're gonna miss your plane.

45:55.171 --> 45:57.071
Yeah, I guess I'm stalling.

45:58.508 --> 46:00.942
You know, there's no reason
why you can't stay.

46:02.779 --> 46:04.508
No, I don't belong here.

46:05.081 --> 46:08.346
Michigan's my home, back
at Ruby's Beauty Emporium.

46:08.919 --> 46:10.716
Hawaii may be a paradise
for most people,

46:10.787 --> 46:13.278
but for me
it was just a nightmare.

46:15.392 --> 46:17.155
Except for meeting you.

46:26.336 --> 46:28.361
I'll never forget you, Thomas.

46:29.139 --> 46:33.769
And I'll write you every
day. Let me see your face.

46:35.645 --> 46:38.512
What?
Come on, hand it over.

46:48.058 --> 46:50.424
I see good intentions.
Lots of them.

46:54.564 --> 46:56.259
But only two letters.

46:57.534 --> 46:59.434
And an occasional card
at Christmas.

47:06.776 --> 47:09.210
You leave the face readings
to me, okay?
