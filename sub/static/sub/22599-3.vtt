- I know.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.937
But you don't give up on family.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.564
Just when I was wondering
if Aquaman learned anything...

21:54.856 --> 21:57.192
...from
"The Adventure of the Bad Brother--"

21:58.318 --> 22:01.989
Now, where to begin?
Of course. The beginning.

22:02.239 --> 22:05.117
Chapter one: "A King ls Born."

22:05.367 --> 22:08.370
--I realized he knew
exactly what he was doing.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.749
"Even a king can begin life
in the humblest of circumstances.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.919
Indeed, my earliest memories
are of a lighthouse...

22:16.169 --> 22:19.423
...nestled on the shores of Mercy Reef."
