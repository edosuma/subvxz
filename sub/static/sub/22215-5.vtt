00:00.195 --> 00:02.532
Previously on
The Shannara Chronicles...

00:02.539 --> 00:05.131
The Sword of Shannara is the most
powerful weapon ever forged.

00:05.970 --> 00:07.002
Watch this, Dad.

00:07.009 --> 00:09.725
Give it to me. Now!
Never touch that! Ever!

00:09.761 --> 00:13.029
You think you're my daughter?
That is not possible.

00:13.064 --> 00:16.232
Those tattoos on your hand.
You were in the Border Legion?

00:16.267 --> 00:17.833
My men were the best.

00:17.869 --> 00:20.703
I promised your mother
that I would always protect you.

00:20.738 --> 00:23.372
I knew that your destiny
would bring you back to me.

00:23.408 --> 00:24.507
Where's Catania?

00:24.542 --> 00:25.674
Dead.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.443
You murdered her!

00:27.478 --> 00:30.980
We're getting stronger every day.
You'll never defeat us.

00:31.015 --> 00:34.450
When it comes to the Warlock
Lord, debts are always paid.

00:35.853 --> 00:37.319
The Skull is in Paranor.

00:37.355 --> 00:39.555
Locked in a magical safe.

00:39.590 --> 00:42.992
You have three days, Wil. Bring
me the Druid or your uncle dies.

00:55.907 --> 00:57.822
We're miles from the palace now.

00:58.943 --> 01:02.044
Doesn't matter. The Queen's
guards won't be far behind.

01:02.847 --> 01:04.447
This is where we part ways.

01:04.482 --> 01:06.148
You've got something
more important to do

01:06.184 --> 01:08.717
than stop the Warlock Lord
from coming back?

01:08.753 --> 01:10.886
You don't need me.

01:10.922 --> 01:14.090
Between you, Pretty Boy and the Druid,

01:14.179 --> 01:15.638
Warlock Lord doesn't stand a chance.

01:15.645 --> 01:16.789
That's not the point, Jax.

01:16.796 --> 01:19.929
Look. Maybe when I finish
doing what I gotta do,

01:21.666 --> 01:22.932
I'll try and find you.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.956
There she is.

02:21.859 --> 02:25.094
Cogline, what are you doing here?

02:25.129 --> 02:27.830
I was starting to think
you'd forgotten about me.

02:27.865 --> 02:29.498
That day will never come.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.036
Come on.

02:38.676 --> 02:39.875
Paranor is that way.

02:41.145 --> 02:43.312
You can't go to Paranor.
It's too dangerous.

02:43.347 --> 02:45.347
My friends need my help.

02:45.383 --> 02:48.083
I know her soldiers
just tried to kill you,

02:48.119 --> 02:50.152
but we need to see the Queen.

02:50.188 --> 02:52.121
The fate of the Four
Lands depends on it.

02:58.296 --> 03:02.531
And I feel it running Through my veins

03:28.392 --> 03:31.193
And I need that fire

03:31.229 --> 03:35.898
Just to know that I'm awake

03:36.279 --> 03:39.287
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

03:49.981 --> 03:51.670
We're almost at Paranor.

03:51.677 --> 03:53.220
What's our plan once we get in there?

03:53.227 --> 03:55.584
To stop Bandon and save your uncle.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.119
Oh, just like that, huh?

03:57.154 --> 04:00.522
The moment that you enter Paranor,
Bandon is going to read your mind.

04:00.558 --> 04:02.524
The less I tell you, the safer we are.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.226
I don't like being kept in the dark.

04:04.262 --> 04:06.428
Then, we must trust each other.

04:06.464 --> 04:09.431
The three of us against Bandon
and an army of Mord Wraiths,

04:09.458 --> 04:11.401
it doesn't sound like the
time to be winging it.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.294
There will be no three of us.
Only Wil and I.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.248
You just said that we
have to trust each other.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.974
Until you learn
how to control your power,

04:19.010 --> 04:20.809
I cannot expose you to the Keep's magic.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.578
It is too dangerous to have you with us.

04:22.613 --> 04:24.480
You still think that
I'm plotting against you.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.149
Admit it.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.563
We don't know what Bandon and his
pack of Mord Wraiths are going to do.

04:41.599 --> 04:43.799
Wouldn't it be better
to go in as a team?

04:43.888 --> 04:44.998
Paranor's magic

04:45.005 --> 04:47.931
would not allow creatures of
darkness to breach its walls.

04:47.938 --> 04:49.972
Bandon must enter alone.

04:50.007 --> 04:51.907
Bandon isn't a creature of darkness.

04:52.810 --> 04:53.909
Could have fooled me.

05:16.901 --> 05:19.001
Catania placed her faith in her Kingdom,

05:19.737 --> 05:21.337
and lived to serve others.

05:22.707 --> 05:24.640
She was a true friend,

05:24.675 --> 05:27.676
and more right about matters of
state than I often cared to admit.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.549
Not a day will go by
when I won't miss her.

05:39.523 --> 05:40.607
May she rest.

05:55.406 --> 05:56.972
I mourn with you, my King.

05:58.008 --> 05:59.708
Catania was true.

05:59.744 --> 06:00.843
She deserved better.

06:02.813 --> 06:04.680
We never even found her body.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.249
The Crimson will burn for this.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.755
If you're going after the
Crimson, I want to help.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.053
This isn't some scavenger
hunt in the Wilderun.

06:16.067 --> 06:17.121
This is war.

06:17.128 --> 06:18.994
I know what it is.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.307
And I know this kingdom
like the back of my hand.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.266
I can root out these traitors.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.034
I can't put you in that position,

06:26.837 --> 06:28.704
keeping secrets from the Queen.

06:28.739 --> 06:32.007
I've been lying to Tamlin
since I learned to talk.

06:32.042 --> 06:33.175
I can handle her.

06:46.056 --> 06:48.590
I should have known you'd
make an appearance, Druid.

06:48.626 --> 06:50.726
Ex-druid, your highness.

06:50.761 --> 06:53.362
What has you rushing back
to me after 30 years?

07:04.074 --> 07:05.808
As for you,

07:05.843 --> 07:08.877
my daughter has bartered
for your life, Rover.

07:08.905 --> 07:11.672
You are safe, as long as
she holds up her end.

07:11.679 --> 07:14.450
Guess you forgot to mention that to
the men who just tried to kill me.

07:14.485 --> 07:15.584
An oversight.

07:15.619 --> 07:19.254
Enough. We have more pressing matters.

07:19.290 --> 07:23.459
The Warlock Lord is coming, but I
suspect you know that already.

07:23.494 --> 07:24.827
When I left here, 30 winters ago,

07:24.862 --> 07:28.464
the King swore he would fight the
Warlock Lord to the last man.

07:28.499 --> 07:30.966
I assume there's a point
to this history lesson?

07:31.001 --> 07:32.668
Leah was the only city of the Four Lands

07:32.703 --> 07:35.137
to have been left untouched
by the War of the Races.

07:35.172 --> 07:39.308
The only casualty it suffered
was your husband.

07:39.343 --> 07:43.579
If you want to know if I made
a deal to save my people,

07:44.482 --> 07:45.814
then the answer is yes.

07:47.218 --> 07:50.452
The Warlock Lord killed my
husband and gave me the throne.

07:50.488 --> 07:52.521
And his price?

07:52.556 --> 07:54.323
He needed his magic replenished and I...

07:54.358 --> 07:57.192
He wanted to drink from Heaven's Well.

07:57.228 --> 08:01.263
Yes. But he was destroyed
before he got the chance.

08:01.298 --> 08:02.931
What's Heaven's Well?

08:02.967 --> 08:05.167
It's the source of the Silver River.

08:05.202 --> 08:08.003
Its magic is the lifeblood
of these lands.

08:08.038 --> 08:10.906
Tamlin's family has been
its stewards for centuries.

08:10.941 --> 08:14.209
When the Warlock Lord returns, he'll
expect you to honor your bargain.

08:15.212 --> 08:16.311
He's coming for The Well.

08:16.347 --> 08:20.249
Leah thrives because of
the decisions I've made.

08:20.284 --> 08:22.818
I won't apologize
for protecting my people.

08:22.853 --> 08:26.889
If the Warlock Lord harnesses the
Well's power, he will be unstoppable.

08:27.825 --> 08:29.858
In your effort to save your kingdom,

08:30.995 --> 08:32.361
you have doomed us all.

09:11.355 --> 09:12.516
That's far enough.

09:13.157 --> 09:14.323
Uncle Flick!

09:14.358 --> 09:16.258
I'm okay.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.626
But you shouldn't have come.

09:18.896 --> 09:19.929
Allanon.

09:21.332 --> 09:22.865
You look tired.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.700
I'm tired of your games.

09:24.735 --> 09:27.303
But not too tired to end this.

09:27.338 --> 09:30.606
You two can kill each other
once Flick is safe.

09:30.641 --> 09:34.428
Not until I have the Skull.
That was the deal.

09:34.435 --> 09:36.735
And how do I know you'll hold
up your end of the bargain?

09:36.742 --> 09:39.176
When have I ever lied to you, Wil?

09:39.183 --> 09:41.484
If anything, it's the Druid
that deserves your suspicion.

09:50.027 --> 09:54.063
Though it appears
your intentions are true.

09:55.366 --> 09:56.866
You are here to save your uncle.

09:57.602 --> 09:59.134
As for the Druid,

09:59.637 --> 10:01.070
who knows?

10:01.873 --> 10:03.372
His mind is a vault.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.841
If you want the Skull,

10:06.978 --> 10:08.477
release Flick now.

10:09.647 --> 10:10.679
Of course.

10:13.184 --> 10:14.550
Whatever you say.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.687
Bandon, what are you doing?

10:18.723 --> 10:20.256
Hey.

10:20.291 --> 10:21.357
Protecting myself.

10:22.393 --> 10:24.860
I'll be all right. I'll be all right.

10:25.696 --> 10:26.962
What'd you do to him?

10:26.998 --> 10:29.131
Infected him with a contagion.

10:29.166 --> 10:32.034
If I don't cure him soon, he'll die.

10:32.069 --> 10:36.005
Why? I've done everything you asked.
Everything!

10:36.040 --> 10:38.440
I know. I'm sorry, Wil.

10:39.043 --> 10:40.442
I trust you, but...

10:41.679 --> 10:43.178
I just can't trust the Druid.

10:54.692 --> 10:57.059
The Skull is this way.

11:11.075 --> 11:14.577
But if you do this,
there'll be no turning back.

11:15.346 --> 11:16.579
That's the idea.

11:54.385 --> 11:55.456
Nice try.

11:55.653 --> 11:56.785
Now!

12:08.099 --> 12:09.632
What are you doing here?

12:09.667 --> 12:11.634
Making sure Bandon
doesn't leave with the Skull.

12:12.803 --> 12:15.204
So, you were in on this?

12:15.239 --> 12:17.640
That bickering outside,
that was just for show?

12:25.750 --> 12:29.818
Why didn't you tell me that Lyria
was Queen Tamlin's daughter?

12:29.854 --> 12:33.355
Wait, don't say it.
You were trying to protect me.

12:38.195 --> 12:41.630
Actually, I was hoping you
and Lyria could start over.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.800
Build a life that wasn't defined
by your parents' mistakes.

12:45.302 --> 12:46.735
I was naive.

12:46.771 --> 12:49.972
After all these years,
I should've known better.

12:50.007 --> 12:52.341
Then tell me the truth, now.

12:54.245 --> 12:55.978
Where did I get this tattoo?

12:57.782 --> 13:00.115
Why did the Druid order
send you to protect me?

13:00.151 --> 13:01.684
How did my mother really die?

13:05.189 --> 13:06.355
Tattoo on your shoulder,

13:08.273 --> 13:13.176
the symbol means you are a descendant
of a sect that survived the Great Wars.

13:15.232 --> 13:16.765
Armageddon's Children.

13:18.102 --> 13:21.003
They survived because
they weren't entirely Human.

13:21.038 --> 13:24.173
They were a hybrid of Human and Demon.

13:24.208 --> 13:26.442
That meant that they could be corrupted

13:26.477 --> 13:29.378
and controlled by anyone
with powerful dark magic.

13:30.081 --> 13:31.613
Was my mother one of them?

13:32.917 --> 13:34.089
Yes.

13:35.619 --> 13:37.219
What happened to her?

13:41.258 --> 13:44.526
You were hunted
constantly, nowhere was safe.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.895
Your mother was fatally
wounded by a Demon.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.766
I don't know how they found her.

13:50.801 --> 13:52.401
They can sense her magic.

13:52.436 --> 13:53.869
It's too late for me.

13:53.904 --> 13:55.671
Keep her safe.

13:55.706 --> 13:57.973
Please, Cogline,
you're the only one who can.

14:00.778 --> 14:02.978
I will always love you, Eretria.

14:03.739 --> 14:04.819
Mommy!

14:07.518 --> 14:08.550
Mommy!

14:10.821 --> 14:12.788
I promised her that I would protect you.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.557
She convinced me

14:15.593 --> 14:18.761
that you could just as easily be
a force for good as for evil.

14:19.363 --> 14:21.864
And she was right.

14:21.899 --> 14:25.601
That is why the Ellcrys chose
you to open up the Bloodfire.

14:25.636 --> 14:27.883
When you said that the
truth would bring me pain,

14:27.890 --> 14:29.102
is this what you meant?

14:33.744 --> 14:38.147
All my life, I've had to break free
from people who tried to control me.

14:40.951 --> 14:43.285
And now you're saying
I may not have a choice.

14:44.421 --> 14:46.155
You do.

14:46.190 --> 14:49.091
Your mother believed it and so do I,

14:49.126 --> 14:52.661
but if the Warlock Lord rises,
he will sense you.

14:52.696 --> 14:56.398
He will try to get inside
your head and use you.

14:56.433 --> 14:58.801
How can I believe you
after all your lies?

15:02.506 --> 15:03.806
'Cause I can prove it.

15:21.574 --> 15:25.409
Neither magic nor violence
can be used within this cell.

15:25.444 --> 15:28.379
The Druids ensured it to prevent
their captives from escaping

15:28.414 --> 15:30.514
or killing one another.

15:35.955 --> 15:38.055
Lower your weapon, boy.

15:38.090 --> 15:41.258
This prison was designed for
beings much stronger than you.

15:48.734 --> 15:49.900
You lied.

15:50.469 --> 15:52.603
You said we'd save him.

15:52.638 --> 15:55.206
It was always my intention.

15:55.241 --> 15:57.074
But now he's just
a pawn to you, isn't he?

15:58.444 --> 16:00.611
Another sacrifice for the greater good.

16:02.248 --> 16:06.667
Press the runes in the order I
taught you, then say my name.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.141
That is the only way I can be
released from this prison.

16:09.922 --> 16:11.689
What about him?

16:11.724 --> 16:14.491
If you say my name and my name only,

16:14.527 --> 16:16.560
he will remain in sight.

16:16.596 --> 16:19.830
But hurry, the longer I'm confined
in here the weaker I become.

16:20.233 --> 16:22.266
Wait.

16:22.301 --> 16:24.468
You're not going anywhere
until Flick is cured.

16:24.503 --> 16:25.870
We had a deal.

16:25.905 --> 16:27.805
There's nothing you can do for him now.

16:29.757 --> 16:32.124
I swear I wasn't trying
to trick you, Wil.

16:32.131 --> 16:34.740
We had to keep you in the dark so
Bandon couldn't read your mind.

16:34.747 --> 16:38.616
Allanon knew Bandon wouldn't walk
into his trap without collateral.

16:38.651 --> 16:40.251
He just didn't care.

16:45.157 --> 16:47.358
Wil. Please.

16:48.027 --> 16:49.660
Allanon is right.

16:51.163 --> 16:52.696
You need to let me go.

16:53.165 --> 16:54.465
Never.

16:55.334 --> 16:56.667
I can still save you.

17:05.912 --> 17:07.611
Wil, stop it. You're making it worse.

17:07.968 --> 17:09.077
I'm sorry.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.784
There's only one way to save him, Wil.

17:15.694 --> 17:19.029
Bring me the real Skull and I will
reverse the flow of the poison.

17:19.157 --> 17:20.223
Why should I trust you?

17:20.259 --> 17:22.760
Because my quarrel is with the Druid.

17:22.795 --> 17:25.095
Not with you. Not with your uncle.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.897
Do not be fooled. He is
trying to manipulate you.

17:27.934 --> 17:31.902
Don't! You, of all people,
do not get to say that.

17:31.938 --> 17:35.973
The path to the Skull
is protected by strong magic.

17:36.008 --> 17:39.243
You will need the blood of a Shannara

17:39.278 --> 17:40.978
and a Druid to access it.

17:42.915 --> 17:45.082
It's good that I have
your daughter out here.

17:46.626 --> 17:48.485
Don't put me in the middle of this.

17:48.521 --> 17:50.387
You're already in the middle of this.

17:50.394 --> 17:52.193
You showed up in Storlock and suddenly

17:52.200 --> 17:54.260
there are Demons hunting me
and my uncle gets taken.

17:54.267 --> 17:57.201
I came to warn you about the Crimson,
I'm not responsible for this.

17:57.229 --> 17:59.630
There are no coincidences
when it comes to magic.

17:59.665 --> 18:03.100
You showed up because you
have a part to play.

18:03.135 --> 18:05.235
And he still doesn't
believe you're his daughter.

18:09.241 --> 18:12.743
You want me to defy Allanon
and help you, fine.

18:12.778 --> 18:14.778
But don't act like him while you do it.

18:14.814 --> 18:16.914
You have to trust me, Mareth.

18:16.949 --> 18:18.882
I'm not going to let Bandon win.

18:37.336 --> 18:38.635
What is this place?

18:58.691 --> 19:02.626
Ancient man used places like this
to capture and contain evil beings.

19:03.329 --> 19:04.795
You mean beings like me?

19:17.043 --> 19:18.475
What is that thing?

19:18.511 --> 19:20.210
A Mord Wraith.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.846
It was created using
the Warlock Lord's blood.

19:23.816 --> 19:25.783
Its only purpose is to serve him.

19:26.786 --> 19:28.318
How did you capture it?

19:29.722 --> 19:33.090
A combination of magic and science.

19:35.394 --> 19:37.294
I lured it here.

19:37.329 --> 19:39.496
It can't break through
the electrical barrier.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.956
If the Warlock Lord rises,

19:43.110 --> 19:45.249
he will try to turn you into a weapon

19:45.256 --> 19:47.593
to use against everyone you care about.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.821
The only way to fight the darkness
is to condition yourself.

19:58.984 --> 20:00.184
What are you doing?

20:00.886 --> 20:02.486
Your training starts now.

20:03.489 --> 20:05.022
You asked for the truth.

20:06.192 --> 20:07.524
You need to face it.

20:22.408 --> 20:26.376
It's like I can feel it
trying to get inside my head.

20:26.412 --> 20:28.912
That's because it senses
the darkness in you.

20:30.282 --> 20:32.082
You have to push it back.

20:33.052 --> 20:35.719
Control it, don't let it control you.

20:41.694 --> 20:42.860
Bow to me.

20:52.638 --> 20:53.692
That's enough.

21:00.713 --> 21:02.546
That didn't seem very hard.

21:07.086 --> 21:09.553
Don't get cocky.

21:10.322 --> 21:11.822
That was a good first step.

21:11.857 --> 21:15.425
But you need to keep
practicing, pushing it away.

21:15.461 --> 21:18.228
This Black Wraith is just a servant,

21:18.235 --> 21:21.402
it'll be different if you run into
a Red Wraith. That's the leader.

21:22.868 --> 21:25.102
His darkness is much more powerful.

21:27.740 --> 21:28.805
What is it?

21:29.842 --> 21:31.441
The darkness in me,

21:32.945 --> 21:35.646
when I used it to control that thing

21:37.249 --> 21:38.916
I kind of liked it.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.828
Without the right combination,
we'll be here for months.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.490
You sure Allanon didn't tell you
when you were plotting outside?

21:47.802 --> 21:49.502
He told me how to trigger the cell,

21:49.509 --> 21:51.042
not how to access the Skull.

21:55.634 --> 21:56.733
What're you doing?

21:56.769 --> 21:58.502
Allanon hid the Skull with my father.

21:58.537 --> 22:01.138
Which means the Elf Stones
were here, too.

22:01.173 --> 22:02.806
Maybe they can help us
retrace his steps.

22:19.341 --> 22:20.370
Wil.

22:50.556 --> 22:51.688
What is that?

22:58.631 --> 22:59.830
No Skull.

23:00.866 --> 23:03.166
Doesn't make sense. It should be here.

23:03.602 --> 23:04.735
Now what?

23:08.941 --> 23:11.308
Allanon said it took
a Druid and a Shannara.

23:11.777 --> 23:13.210
I see two slots.

23:15.414 --> 23:16.880
And there are two of us.

23:17.783 --> 23:19.182
You ready to find out who you are?

23:21.720 --> 23:24.855
Mareth. Please don't do this.

23:27.626 --> 23:31.061
Wil, if she is not my
daughter, you will both die.

23:44.777 --> 23:46.410
What if I'm not his daughter? What if...

24:13.372 --> 24:16.273
Whatever this thing is,
I think it worked.

24:25.351 --> 24:26.717
Which makes Allanon your father.

24:28.645 --> 24:29.723
Condolences.

24:35.327 --> 24:37.327
Okay. So, we know who you are.

24:38.397 --> 24:41.131
Now the question is, where are we?

25:32.307 --> 25:34.240
Quiet now.

25:34.276 --> 25:37.310
Lunch is almost ready
and the table needs to be set.

25:46.021 --> 25:48.188
Desmin, go play outside.

25:49.858 --> 25:51.024
Now.

26:07.962 --> 26:09.762
I'm sorry it's been so long.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.560
I wasn't sure if you
were ever coming back.

26:11.567 --> 26:14.681
Sheema. I promised Conor I'd
take care of you and Desmin.

26:16.385 --> 26:17.512
Thank you, Jax.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.553
Conor was the best soldier
in my battalion.

26:23.859 --> 26:25.892
No amount of gold will bring
him back, I know that.

26:26.895 --> 26:28.061
Mom!

26:30.098 --> 26:31.128
Mom!

26:34.069 --> 26:35.535
Mom!

26:39.741 --> 26:40.940
Where's the Druid?

26:41.777 --> 26:42.815
What did you do?

26:45.447 --> 26:47.147
- My baby!
- Sheema, wait!

27:29.091 --> 27:31.224
I got no fear of death.

27:31.259 --> 27:32.926
Death is too good for you.

27:47.342 --> 27:48.675
Get out of here!

27:51.179 --> 27:52.378
Sheema...

27:56.318 --> 27:58.952
Stay away from me. You're cursed.

27:59.654 --> 28:01.221
Don't ever come back here.

28:21.710 --> 28:22.976
That's Shady Vale.

28:24.079 --> 28:25.812
It can't be.

28:25.847 --> 28:28.581
The last time we saw it, it was
in flames. Everybody left.

28:28.617 --> 28:30.850
I agree, but explain that.

28:30.886 --> 28:33.386
Why would we be transported
back to your hometown?

28:36.324 --> 28:38.825
Because Shea and Allanon must
have hidden the Skull here.

28:39.628 --> 28:40.660
Come on.

29:11.026 --> 29:13.726
I hate waterfalls.

29:31.613 --> 29:35.348
This is definitely my village,
but I don't recognize anyone.

29:35.383 --> 29:38.952
Hmm. They don't seem
to recognize you, either.

29:38.987 --> 29:41.588
Let's just keep our heads down
and find that Skull.

29:45.260 --> 29:47.493
So, the girl with the
illusions is your daughter?

29:50.632 --> 29:52.765
You brought her here, untrained,

29:52.801 --> 29:56.302
unprepared, to use against
me like a weapon.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.106
And now she's turned on you.

30:02.711 --> 30:04.410
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

30:06.147 --> 30:07.814
She is nothing like you.

30:09.117 --> 30:10.283
Are you sure?

30:11.586 --> 30:14.087
I sensed a deep well of pain in her.

30:17.325 --> 30:19.592
Maybe after I get out of here,

30:20.595 --> 30:21.995
I'll take her under my wing.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.965
Help her unlock her true potential.

30:27.636 --> 30:29.502
That is not going to happen.

30:31.806 --> 30:33.139
Maybe you're right.

30:34.576 --> 30:37.143
Maybe I'll leave her here to rot,

30:38.346 --> 30:40.647
along with everything else
you hold dear.

30:42.384 --> 30:43.883
For the greater good.

30:52.827 --> 30:53.960
Leave me alone!

30:53.995 --> 30:55.828
We warned you before.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.531
You filthy half-breed!

30:58.538 --> 31:00.228
If you so much as look
at my sister again,

31:00.235 --> 31:02.168
I'll chop your ears off
and make you eat them!

31:06.541 --> 31:08.241
I didn't touch her.

31:08.276 --> 31:09.342
Don't lie to me!

31:10.745 --> 31:12.078
I saw you flirting with her.

31:15.750 --> 31:16.804
Let him go.

31:21.122 --> 31:22.322
I think mine's bigger.

31:35.170 --> 31:38.371
Thanks. I thought they were gonna
stick me like a roast pig.

31:39.541 --> 31:42.008
I'm Wil. This is Mareth.

31:42.075 --> 31:45.410
Nice to meet you.
I'm Shea. Shea Ohmsford.

31:56.756 --> 31:58.155
It's not deep.

31:58.190 --> 32:00.157
Should be gone in a couple of days.

32:00.192 --> 32:02.459
So what was the story with those jerks?

32:02.495 --> 32:05.296
Seemed a little more personal than
your average everyday Elf-hate.

32:05.331 --> 32:07.464
They found out I've been dating a Human.

32:07.471 --> 32:09.015
The guy with the knife is her brother.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.035
Charming.

32:11.070 --> 32:13.637
I mean, he's a decent guy.
It's just how he was raised.

32:13.673 --> 32:15.906
The Humans around here
don't trust Elves.

32:15.942 --> 32:17.708
It's not just around here.

32:18.945 --> 32:21.512
So, what about your family?

32:22.381 --> 32:23.847
Where are they?

32:24.817 --> 32:26.417
I'm adopted.

32:26.452 --> 32:28.319
My family are Humans,

32:28.354 --> 32:30.287
so I'm the only pointy-ears around here.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.989
Makes me an easy target.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.825
Anyway, where are you two from?

32:36.662 --> 32:40.197
A village about 40 miles south.

32:40.232 --> 32:43.467
It's called Bark Root.

32:44.437 --> 32:45.718
I've never heard of it.

32:47.573 --> 32:49.239
You must be starving.

32:49.275 --> 32:52.343
My brother Flick's a cook, but
he's at the sheep market today.

32:52.378 --> 32:54.712
How does stale bread and cheese sound?

32:55.381 --> 32:57.014
That sounds amazing.

32:57.049 --> 32:58.849
Great. I'll fetch my horse.

33:03.222 --> 33:05.289
So, just to be clear,

33:05.324 --> 33:09.460
the Druid portal brought us back in
time so we could meet your father?

33:09.495 --> 33:14.698
Yes, to a time before
my dad met Allanon.

33:14.734 --> 33:17.768
Before he got the sword,
before everything.

33:17.803 --> 33:20.070
He seems sweet.
I can see where you get it.

33:20.973 --> 33:23.140
He doesn't know what's coming.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.843
What magic does to him. To my family.

33:26.912 --> 33:29.013
What if I told him? He could run away.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.214
Maybe he'd be happy.

33:30.221 --> 33:32.221
Or maybe, without Shea to stop him,

33:32.228 --> 33:33.874
the Warlock Lord would
take over the world

33:33.881 --> 33:35.681
and none of us would even exist.

33:35.688 --> 33:38.255
The past is the past, Wil.
We can't change it.

33:39.499 --> 33:41.925
The only thing we know for sure
is that your uncle is dying,

33:41.961 --> 33:43.727
and we have to find the Skull.

33:43.763 --> 33:45.295
It could be anywhere.

33:45.331 --> 33:48.098
Yeah. But the portal
brought us here, right?

33:48.768 --> 33:50.901
To your dad.

33:50.936 --> 33:53.203
And even if he doesn't know
it yet, he must be the key.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.915
There's something you need to see.

34:08.154 --> 34:10.788
This is his top lieutenant, Valcaa.

34:11.623 --> 34:14.190
He can lead us to General Riga.

34:14.226 --> 34:17.127
We take Riga out,
we can prevent a civil war.

34:18.496 --> 34:19.897
What's in it for you?

34:19.931 --> 34:24.735
If I become your Queen, the
Elves will be my people, too.

34:24.770 --> 34:26.969
Besides, we all want the same things.

34:27.005 --> 34:29.139
To live free, without fear.

34:34.413 --> 34:35.483
What's your price?

34:37.416 --> 34:40.150
I get to help you interrogate him.

34:40.186 --> 34:43.320
I may be a bounty hunter, but cash
isn't the only language I speak.

34:44.590 --> 34:46.156
This bastard made it personal.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.859
All right. Wake him up.

34:58.370 --> 35:01.672
We appreciate your help,
Princess, but you should leave.

35:03.242 --> 35:05.008
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

35:13.152 --> 35:17.354
When I was a kid, my dad used
to hide things in the barn.

35:18.624 --> 35:21.125
Things he didn't want
me or my mom to find.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.194
Go check it out. I'll keep
Daddy Dearest occupied.

35:31.403 --> 35:32.970
Hey.

35:33.005 --> 35:36.373
Wil just went to go water the bushes.
He'll be back soon.

35:36.408 --> 35:38.709
Was the food okay? You get enough?

35:38.744 --> 35:41.979
Are you kidding? We've only had
squirrel jerky for the past week,

35:42.014 --> 35:45.048
so, yeah, it was better
than okay. I'm stuffed.

35:52.258 --> 35:54.792
How long have you and Wil been together?

35:54.827 --> 35:58.228
Oh. No, we're not together.
We're just friends.

35:58.264 --> 36:00.097
Are you kidding?

36:00.132 --> 36:03.567
The way you look at him, it's the
same look Heady used to give me.

36:05.171 --> 36:07.571
I think you should tell him.

36:07.606 --> 36:09.273
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

36:24.590 --> 36:25.889
Who are you?

36:26.659 --> 36:29.526
Hi. I'm, uh, Wil.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.362
Wil, uh, Barnlander.

36:32.369 --> 36:36.204
I, um, my friend and I, we
helped Shea avoid some trouble.

36:36.211 --> 36:38.275
You're the people who rescued
him from my brother?

36:41.674 --> 36:43.440
Which would make you Heady.

36:44.776 --> 36:45.873
Thank you.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.911
Ever since everyone
in the village found out,

36:47.947 --> 36:49.446
they won't stop harassing us.

36:50.449 --> 36:51.782
Harassing him.

36:54.753 --> 36:59.223
Yeah, I... I know a thing or two
about prejudice. It's rough.

36:59.258 --> 37:01.024
It's not just that.

37:01.060 --> 37:02.826
I mean, I could bear it
if it was, but...

37:03.762 --> 37:05.062
But what?

37:05.097 --> 37:07.097
There are things he's hiding from me,

37:07.132 --> 37:08.765
things he's not telling me.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.168
And it's killing me.

37:11.175 --> 37:12.952
I don't know if I can be
with somebody who...

37:12.959 --> 37:14.225
Be with someone who what?

37:16.342 --> 37:17.407
Shea...

37:17.443 --> 37:18.942
Maybe we shouldn't be together.

37:18.978 --> 37:21.778
Your whole family would certainly
be happier if I disappeared.

37:21.814 --> 37:23.780
I'm sure we can work this out.

37:23.816 --> 37:27.451
I like you, Wil, but you don't know
us, and you don't know Shady Vale.

37:28.254 --> 37:29.853
We can't keep doing this, Heady.

37:31.585 --> 37:32.616
It's over.

37:45.956 --> 37:47.889
No sign of him. You?

37:47.924 --> 37:49.290
He couldn't have gone far.

37:49.326 --> 37:51.492
If there's one thing Shea's
good at, it's disappearing.

37:53.663 --> 37:55.830
I need you to stay here with
her in case he comes back.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.032
You think you know where he is?

37:58.068 --> 38:01.235
I might. But we're running out of time.
We need to find that Skull.

38:01.271 --> 38:03.671
We also need to figure out
this little lover's quarrel.

38:03.707 --> 38:06.507
Otherwise, we might go back and
find out that you were never born.

38:06.543 --> 38:08.676
That might be a good thing.

38:08.712 --> 38:11.346
Yeah, to some people
you may be a pain in the ass.

38:12.282 --> 38:13.948
But I'm pretty sure I'd miss you.

38:31.234 --> 38:32.834
How did you find me here?

38:33.670 --> 38:35.470
Heady thought you might come here.

38:35.505 --> 38:37.038
I never told her about this place.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.173
No, of course not.

38:39.209 --> 38:41.376
She just told me to
check the swimming hole.

38:42.512 --> 38:44.145
The cave was a hunch.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.918
I have a spot like this where I grew up.

38:52.222 --> 38:53.988
A place my dad showed me.

38:56.326 --> 38:58.393
Used to hide there from bullies.

39:00.730 --> 39:04.265
The ears rub people the wrong
way no matter where you go.

39:08.838 --> 39:11.572
Shea. What's going on?

39:15.912 --> 39:17.745
What if they're right about me?

39:18.815 --> 39:22.050
What if I am bad for her?

39:22.085 --> 39:23.117
That's crazy.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.720
You're a good guy.

39:25.755 --> 39:27.588
Yeah, but I haven't told her everything.

39:31.261 --> 39:32.794
I've been seeing things, Wil.

39:35.398 --> 39:36.764
What sort of things?

39:47.177 --> 39:50.945
Monsters with silver faces
trying to kill me.

39:52.415 --> 39:53.748
Feels so real.

39:55.485 --> 39:58.386
Listen, Shea. You're not crazy.

39:59.656 --> 40:02.824
And you're not dreaming.
I've seen these creatures, too.

40:04.961 --> 40:08.329
They're called Mord Wraiths. And
I assure you, they're very real.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.499
This isn't funny!

40:11.534 --> 40:14.368
You're having visions of the future.
Of what's coming.

40:14.404 --> 40:16.404
No. What are you...

40:17.073 --> 40:18.172
Who are you?

40:25.782 --> 40:27.782
Heady.

40:29.519 --> 40:30.550
What is it?

40:32.422 --> 40:33.821
What'd you see?

40:34.791 --> 40:37.325
She's in danger.
She was covered in blood.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.033
Shea!

40:48.338 --> 40:50.171
Hey, Shea! Wait.

40:59.482 --> 41:01.649
Shea! Wait.

41:16.533 --> 41:19.033
Shannara!

41:24.174 --> 41:25.873
You... You're real. How?

41:39.656 --> 41:41.122
Shea, we need to go.

41:41.157 --> 41:42.356
How did you do that with...

41:42.392 --> 41:44.525
I know you have questions,
but we have to move.

41:44.561 --> 41:46.861
It hissed something at me. "Shannara."

41:47.597 --> 41:48.829
What does it mean?

41:49.999 --> 41:51.399
Tell me, what's a "Shannara"?

41:53.503 --> 41:54.569
You are.
