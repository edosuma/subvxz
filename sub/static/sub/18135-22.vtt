Batman.
I could sure use you out here.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.175
I'm working on an antidote.
But I've sent backup.

(ROARING)

00:47.447 --> 00:50.348
Superman!
What's happening here?

00:50.383 --> 00:52.617
The plants seem to be turning
against the people.

00:52.652 --> 00:55.120
I have a feeling Poison Ivy
is behind this.

Swamp Thing!

01:05.632 --> 01:08.033
You mean, you're the one
behind all this?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.502
No, no.
It's Poison Ivy, all right.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.904
Uh, would you mind,
uh, putting me down?

01:12.939 --> 01:14.806
Oh, sure. I'll put you down.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.309
(GRUNTS)
For good!

Gee, I'm sorry, guys.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.695
I'm a plant.
She controls plants.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.498
Swamp Thing! Hey, buddy.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.066
You here to help out
with the gardening?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.734
Firestorm.
I don't know how but...

01:42.769 --> 01:44.536
Wait. Didn't you have
a blind date last night?

01:44.571 --> 01:46.805
Don't worry about that now.
I'm trying to tell you...

01:46.840 --> 01:49.074
Whoo-hoo! Blind date!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.642
(SING-SONGY)
Da-da-da-da, date, date!

01:50.677 --> 01:52.177
Come on, man.
Tell me about the date.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.545
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.580
The blind date
turned out to be Poison Ivy.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.583
She tricked me.
We have to stop her.
She's the...

01:58.618 --> 01:59.484
(GRUNTS)

01:59.519 --> 02:01.620
...orchid of my heart,

02:01.655 --> 02:04.656
and the greatest woman
in the world.

02:04.691 --> 02:07.159
Together we will pollinate
this city

02:07.194 --> 02:09.961
and then Gotham will be ours.

02:09.996 --> 02:12.797
(LAUGHING)

02:12.832 --> 02:15.967
I seem to be detecting some
mixed signals there, buddy.

-Whoa! Hey, man!

02:18.205 --> 02:19.371
Be whoever you want,
all right?

02:19.406 --> 02:22.841
I'm sorry! Jeez!
Grumpy Swampy.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.777
Ronald. He's obviously being
controlled by Poison Ivy.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.679
Oh, that clears up
a lot of things.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.915
We need to make
a wall of nuclear fire.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.584
It should dehydrate him
without causing
permanent damage.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.252
Look at you
dropping knowledge!

02:34.287 --> 02:35.721
The heat is on!

02:41.127 --> 02:44.262
(GROANING)

02:44.297 --> 02:46.932
Nuclear dehydration.
That's a good idea.

02:46.967 --> 02:50.135
Just so you know, I'm feeling
super-guilty about this.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.471
No. No.
It's very... Very effective.

I've traced Ivy's location.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.720
She's in the Kannager
Building on Sheldon.

I'll meet you there.

Whoo-hoo. Ha-ha!

(LAUGHS) Heya, Red.
I'm out of plant bombs.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.851
I have a new batch right here.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.020
You have to give one
to my husband-to-be.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.623
Those filthy meatbags are
weakening my control over him.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.192
Oh, and make sure
he comes back here.

04:21.227 --> 04:22.961
We have a wedding to plan.

Careful, Ronald. We don't want
to permanently hurt him.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.002
So thirsty.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.673
Hey, Sparky! Think fast!

05:09.809 --> 05:11.509
Oh!

05:11.544 --> 05:13.211
You don't look
so good, Swampy.

Oh, man.
I feel like a million bucks.
Uh-oh.

You better get out of here
before...

05:38.838 --> 05:40.672

Way to defend your woman!

05:47.881 --> 05:51.116
You better get back.
Ivy wants your help
in planning the wedding.

I'm on my way.

into a marshmallow and...

Mmm...
Hey, pretty tasty.
I have a fallback job.

out of control.

Oh, and some over there.
And the altar can go here.

07:11.130 --> 07:14.032

flowers or purple flowers?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.400
-It's over, Ivy.
-Huh?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.535
Time to turn yourself in.

Batman. I was wondering
when you would show up.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.904
And you didn't come
empty-handed.

08:59.939 --> 09:02.240
An antidote for my shmoopy,
no doubt.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.643
But, as you can see,
he's all mine now.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.779

for the wedding?

for a weed-whacker?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.560
Get him.

Buddy, take it easy!

09:42.949 --> 09:44.616
Destroy them, shmoopy.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.719
I'm not your "shmoopy."

Shmoopy!

Shmoopy?
Shmoopy-whoopy!

09:54.160 --> 09:58.196
-Plants, get them.
-Don't bother.
