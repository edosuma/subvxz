WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.668
Wow! That's keen!

01:26.693 --> 01:28.335
If you think that's

01:28.360 --> 01:29.608
something, wait until you see

01:29.633 --> 01:31.029
my cousin, Lady Edwina.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.338
See?  What did I tell you?

01:38.338 --> 01:39.338
Oh, wow!

01:40.055 --> 01:44.688
Uncle Randor, Auntie Marlena,
how nice to see you both again.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.720
Welcome Edwina,
it's good to have you back in Eternos.

01:48.766 --> 01:51.964
I really should've visited
before. But with all the parties

01:51.989 --> 01:54.890
I have to attend, I can hardly get away.

01:55.571 --> 01:56.771
You remember Adam, of course?

01:59.502 --> 02:01.233
Can this be really little Adam?

02:01.258 --> 02:03.379
Oh, just look at the way you've grown.

02:03.992 --> 02:06.192
I swear, if we weren't cousins...

02:08.728 --> 02:11.451
Edwina, let me present Orko.
Our resident magician.

02:13.725 --> 02:17.147
[shudders] Oh, hello.

02:17.172 --> 02:19.491
Uh, hi.

02:20.673 --> 02:22.490
And our Man-At-Arms, Duncan.

02:22.515 --> 02:24.720
And his daughter, Captain Teela.

02:26.249 --> 02:27.334
How do you do?

02:27.359 --> 02:30.047
Oh well I'd love
to stay and chat

02:30.072 --> 02:31.228
with the help...

02:31.253 --> 02:33.728
but I'm really rather tired.

02:34.648 --> 02:36.001
The help?!  Why...

02:39.013 --> 02:40.654
Would you be kind enough to show me to

02:40.679 --> 02:42.370
my room, Adam?
Of course.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.247
Good day, Your Majesties.
Man-At-Arms... and Tippy...

02:51.732 --> 02:54.395
That's Teela. She may be the King's niece,

02:54.420 --> 02:57.205
but I've never met a
ruder, more arrogant...

02:57.829 --> 03:02.139
sweeter and lovelier and prettier.
Oh come on Orko, you

03:02.164 --> 03:06.550
can't be serious. I am serious.
I think she's beautiful.

03:24.435 --> 03:26.421
Yes? Please Lady Edwina,

03:26.446 --> 03:29.019
I brought you this,
as a welcoming present.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.715
Oh, what a lovely... brooch.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.565
I'm sorry but, I'm afraid

03:35.590 --> 03:37.895
I didn't bring anything...

03:37.920 --> 03:40.312
erm, suitable to wear with it.

03:42.350 --> 03:43.350
Thanks anyway, Porko.

03:45.431 --> 03:46.431
That's Orko.

03:49.337 --> 03:50.728
Oh, Orko.

03:52.353 --> 03:53.409
Rats.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.402
Hey, take it easy little buddy.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.487
If I wasn't a poor little
nobody, I could give

04:02.512 --> 04:05.067
her a real gift. Then she'd really want me.

04:05.651 --> 04:07.409
Orko, you can't buy a friend.

04:07.434 --> 04:09.349
Not a real one at least.
Sure,

04:09.374 --> 04:10.861
just be yourself old pal.

04:10.886 --> 04:12.670
You got a lot going for you.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.947
Hello everyone.
You may not know Edwina,

04:17.973 --> 04:19.512
but you're in the
presence of a hero.

04:20.781 --> 04:21.781
Huh? What hero?

04:23.822 --> 04:26.730
Oh really?
Yup, years ago Orko

04:26.755 --> 04:27.852
saved my life,

04:27.877 --> 04:30.312
it happened in the
season of storms.

04:31.219 --> 04:33.585
Back when I was a kid,
Cringer and I were out playing that

04:33.610 --> 04:35.900
day and wandered far from the palace.

04:38.020 --> 04:40.523
Suddenly a storm broke loose and

04:40.548 --> 04:43.320
we found ourselves lost,
in the Tar Swamps.

04:46.652 --> 04:48.114
Adam, I'm so scared.

04:48.139 --> 04:50.652
Oh don't worry Cringer,
we'll be alright.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.741
But we weren't the only
ones in the Swamp that day.

04:59.348 --> 05:01.406
Hey, where am I?

05:01.431 --> 05:02.878
This isn't Trolla.

05:03.927 --> 05:08.347
Somehow, the storm's incredible
power had opened a temporary doorway,

05:08.672 --> 05:09.945
which pulled Orko,

05:09.970 --> 05:13.081
out of his world,
and stranded in on ours.

05:15.061 --> 05:16.157
Help!  Help!

05:18.172 --> 05:21.462
Uh-oh, they're in trouble.
Hang on, kid, I'll save ya.

05:25.344 --> 05:27.689
Oh, Magic Medallion,
hear my command,

05:27.714 --> 05:29.873
and give these two
a helping hand!

05:41.447 --> 05:43.911
Another job well done, by Orko, the Great.

05:44.229 --> 05:45.229
Whoops!

05:50.606 --> 05:53.148
Because of his bravery,
we adopted Orko,

05:53.173 --> 05:55.775
and made him a member
of the royal court.

05:57.734 --> 06:00.694
And that's how my little friend
here, became a hero.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.104
Could that charm you
lost really work magic?

06:04.575 --> 06:07.337
Oh sure, my medallion can
conjure up just about anything.

06:08.269 --> 06:09.744
It's too bad you don't have it now.

06:12.152 --> 06:13.152
Hmm...

06:23.427 --> 06:24.548
Orko?!

06:25.473 --> 06:27.934
Hm... It's not like
Orko to miss breakfast.

06:28.783 --> 06:30.603
I don't think he's been
here all night, look!

06:31.032 --> 06:32.587
His bed hasn't been slept in.

06:33.111 --> 06:35.636
Yesterday he was talking
about the magic medallion he

06:35.661 --> 06:38.185
lost in the Tar Swamp.
You don't think he'd really...?

06:38.607 --> 06:42.311
I'm afraid so.
We better find him before he gets there.

06:55.696 --> 06:57.935
Let's now find the magic medallion.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.041
I wish I had a great present for Edwina.

07:00.185 --> 07:02.769
I seem to remember it
was right around here...

07:05.283 --> 07:07.277
What's that?

07:07.302 --> 07:08.348
Eep!

07:10.025 --> 07:11.025
Hmm...

07:11.520 --> 07:12.520
Beast Man!

07:16.264 --> 07:17.860
Get over here, you furry fool!

07:21.204 --> 07:25.323
We'll soon have need of your special...
talents.

07:26.532 --> 07:28.500
You have the primeval potion?
Right here.

07:30.260 --> 07:32.868
With this magic brew,
I can bring back any of the

07:32.893 --> 07:35.500
prehistoric monsters that
perished in this swamp,

07:36.142 --> 07:40.581
and I'll use those monsters in
my conquest of Palace Eternia.

07:41.350 --> 07:43.581
The Palace?  Oh no, I gotta warn them.

07:46.101 --> 07:47.101
Yikes!

07:48.384 --> 07:49.446
Who's there?

07:49.471 --> 07:51.594
It's the king's fool, Orko.

07:51.995 --> 07:53.049
Leave this to me.

07:53.463 --> 07:59.322
Powers of darkness, make wings appear
and fly that sprite back over here!

08:01.920 --> 08:02.920
Hey!

08:03.306 --> 08:05.089
Well, well, a little visitor.

08:08.708 --> 08:09.708
Ya big bully!

08:09.805 --> 08:11.334
You'll never get away with this.

08:11.359 --> 08:12.409
He-Man will stop ya!

08:13.025 --> 08:15.309
Oh really? Show the little runt

08:15.334 --> 08:17.550
what we have planned for He-Man,

08:17.673 --> 08:18.673
Evil-Lyn.

08:30.899 --> 08:33.712
Look, at what's coming now.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.251
Beast Man, use your mental power to

08:41.277 --> 08:42.701
tame and command that creature.

08:51.596 --> 08:53.624
Tame as a chicken.

08:53.649 --> 08:57.142
Good! Now to take the palace.

09:02.076 --> 09:03.160
It's a good thing Adam

09:03.185 --> 09:04.737
decided not to come. I know he

09:04.762 --> 09:06.141
means well, but his bungling

09:06.166 --> 09:07.544
would only get in the way.

09:08.457 --> 09:09.923
Well, if he can contact He-Man for

09:09.948 --> 09:11.532
us, he'll be doing more than his share.

09:17.995 --> 09:21.091
By the power of Grayskull.

09:25.780 --> 09:30.380
I have the power!

10:02.442 --> 10:04.811
Listen... a Wind Raider!

10:07.693 --> 10:08.780
I hear it your oaf.

10:10.303 --> 10:12.530
Let's send our royal friends
a welcoming committee.

10:19.283 --> 10:20.117
Look out!

10:32.202 --> 10:34.898
Look, Cat!
Teela and Man-At-Arms are in trouble.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.541
We're hit!

10:45.454 --> 10:46.755
No!  They're gonna crash!

11:02.400 --> 11:05.597
Teela! Duncan!
Up here, He-Man.

11:13.241 --> 11:15.574
When I saw you were in
trouble, I flew down to help.

11:15.599 --> 11:18.080
It's a good thing you were nearby, Stratos.

11:18.546 --> 11:21.107
I'd still like to know where
those monsters came from.

11:21.687 --> 11:25.871
I don't know, but I'll bet you
anything Skeletor's mixed up in this.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.779
Right, He-Fool!
Skeletor!

11:29.804 --> 11:33.064
Let go Orko go, or I'll...

11:34.143 --> 11:38.226
This troublesome Trollan is the
least of your worries, look!

11:40.367 --> 11:43.018
It's a Drachadon!
A hungry Drachadon,

11:43.043 --> 11:45.630
and we're taking him
to lunch at the palace.

11:45.935 --> 11:47.697
No, if we stop you first.

11:50.155 --> 11:53.062
I'm sorry He-Man, but you weren't invited.

11:57.318 --> 11:58.318
Let's go.

12:02.541 --> 12:03.541
Here comes the other one.

12:16.377 --> 12:18.305
Catch me if you can,
you flying freak!

12:29.087 --> 12:30.687
He won't be going anywhere, for a while.

12:33.598 --> 12:36.265
Thanks Stratos.
Now let's get back to the others.

12:58.339 --> 12:59.868
Stratos, could you fly Teela and

12:59.893 --> 13:01.851
Man-At-Arms, back to the palace?
Sure.

13:02.038 --> 13:03.038
No problem.

13:03.039 --> 13:04.267
Good!
We've got to catch up

13:04.292 --> 13:05.746
with Skeletor and his monster,

13:10.448 --> 13:12.187
and they have a big head start.

13:22.016 --> 13:23.016
Edwina!

13:23.473 --> 13:25.330
Oh, Uncle Randor.

13:25.631 --> 13:29.107
Have you been down here
all this time, girl?

13:31.099 --> 13:33.768
Your aunt and I have missed you.
I'm sorry uncle,

13:33.793 --> 13:36.274
but you have such lovely things.

13:37.638 --> 13:38.772
These gaudy trinkets?

13:38.797 --> 13:40.903
Come, I'll show you some real sights.

13:41.593 --> 13:42.541
If you insist...

13:45.173 --> 13:46.504
What's happening?

13:50.238 --> 13:51.109
A Drachadon!

13:51.134 --> 13:53.455
They've been extinct for ages.

13:54.252 --> 13:55.912
Greetings King Randor!

13:55.937 --> 13:58.629
Unless you'd like my "pet" here to

13:58.654 --> 14:00.136
demolish the palace.

14:00.161 --> 14:02.903
You'll surrender to me immediately.

14:03.618 --> 14:05.792
My dear, in order to protect you

14:05.817 --> 14:07.989
and the kingdom, I must agree.

14:22.182 --> 14:23.599
Get in there!

14:29.627 --> 14:32.447
Are you alright Orko?
Yeah, I think so.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.503
That monster Skeletor, he'll pay for this.

14:36.215 --> 14:37.455
Why isn't someone doing

14:37.480 --> 14:39.258
anything to get us out of here?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.495
You there Gorpo, or Borko, or...

14:43.520 --> 14:46.143
aren't you a magician or something?

14:46.901 --> 14:48.043
Well, I'm kinda with rabbits

14:48.068 --> 14:49.453
and silk tricks than jail cells.

14:50.034 --> 14:52.644
I don't care, I want out!

14:58.418 --> 15:00.315
Powers of Magic, hear my plea,

15:00.340 --> 15:02.868
manage these bars, and let us go free!

15:06.815 --> 15:07.897
They're gone!

15:11.076 --> 15:13.591
Hey, I did it! uh... well, sort of.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.740
I'm getting out of here.
Wait, where are

15:16.765 --> 15:18.858
you going? We have to help the others.

15:19.304 --> 15:22.369
You can stay with those
monsters if you want,

15:22.394 --> 15:25.266
but I'm... Ack! Oh!

15:45.648 --> 15:48.081
He-Man!
Skeletor has taken over the Palace!

15:49.955 --> 15:52.574
Stratos!
Skeletor and the other's are inside.

15:52.599 --> 15:54.079
We'll take care of them.

16:08.974 --> 16:14.105
He's a tough one, Battle Cat.
Yeah, but so am I.

16:26.766 --> 16:29.343
To my conquest of Eternia!

16:29.368 --> 16:32.142
To our conquest, you mean?

16:33.011 --> 16:34.021
Can we join the party?

16:35.893 --> 16:39.409
Man-At-Arms! Teela! Get them, you fools!

17:02.070 --> 17:04.709
Put me down! As you wish..

17:10.886 --> 17:16.416
It's just you against us, Skeletor.
Fool, if you think I'd face you myself?

17:21.690 --> 17:24.058
You'll have to defeat my pet first.

17:30.831 --> 17:34.463
Look up there!
On the monster's back!

17:34.488 --> 17:36.589
I don't see anything.

17:37.455 --> 17:38.555
It's my magic medallion.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.161
It must have stuck to the monster

17:40.186 --> 17:41.627
when it came out of the swamp.

17:43.266 --> 17:44.392
Orko, wait!  Come back!

17:48.368 --> 17:51.690
Come on now. Gotta get ya loose.

17:51.715 --> 17:54.621
Oh, I wish you'd come out!

17:57.588 --> 18:01.352
Hey, it worked!
Orko, we'll keep the monster busy,

18:01.377 --> 18:04.623
while you think up a
spell to send it back!

18:22.086 --> 18:24.537
I think you bit off more
than you can chew this time.

18:27.059 --> 18:28.608
Then again, maybe you didn't.

18:32.025 --> 18:36.448
Orko, wait!... huh?
Oh, Lady Edwina! Oh Orko,

18:36.473 --> 18:40.650
I saw what you did. You can do anything
with that magic charm.

18:41.515 --> 18:45.049
Uh... yeah, but right now I have
to use it to save my friends.

18:45.074 --> 18:48.607
Who cares about them?
Wish us away from this awful place.

18:49.466 --> 18:53.773
I couldn't do that. Oh, think of all
the gold and jewels we could have.

18:54.416 --> 18:56.721
We could be rich without
a care in the world,

18:56.746 --> 18:59.168
and I'd be your very best friend.

19:04.612 --> 19:07.558
No, my friends were right.
You don't like me.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.656
You only like the things
this medallion can do.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.792
Oh, I wish none of this had ever happened.

19:28.699 --> 19:32.793
Orko you are very brave,
using your magic medallion to save us.

19:33.499 --> 19:36.308
I'm sorry you had to lose
your wonderful amulet,

19:36.333 --> 19:38.625
but we both thank you for what you did.

19:39.774 --> 19:41.973
Ah, tweren't nothing.
But you,

19:41.998 --> 19:44.623
Lady Edwina,
have behaved in a shameful manner.

19:45.171 --> 19:47.550
Until you mend your rude and selfish ways,

19:47.575 --> 19:50.018
you are no longer welcome here.

19:55.355 --> 19:56.359
Uh... Lady Edwina.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.384
I know we didn't get along,

19:59.474 --> 20:02.505
but I'd like to give you
this, to remember me by.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.367
Well, at least someone
still appreciates me.

20:08.434 --> 20:09.760
I thought Orko learned you

20:09.785 --> 20:11.621
can't buy friends with presents...

20:18.914 --> 20:20.832
Naturally, I think that's the lesson,

20:20.857 --> 20:23.201
Orko, will never forget.

20:30.261 --> 20:32.081
Today's story was about something more

20:32.106 --> 20:34.206
precious,
more valuable than gold or silver.

20:34.777 --> 20:38.081
It's called 'friendship'. Orko learned
that friendship can't be bought.

20:38.485 --> 20:40.497
Giving somebody a present
may get that person

20:40.522 --> 20:42.226
to act as if he or she is your friend,

20:42.446 --> 20:45.135
but don't be fooled.
A real friend is someone

20:45.160 --> 20:47.906
who likes you for yourself,
not your presents.

20:48.836 --> 20:51.052
So don't try to buy friendship.
Just be yourself,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.442
and treat others with honesty and respect.

20:53.990 --> 20:57.064
Then you'll know the friends
you make, will be real ones.
