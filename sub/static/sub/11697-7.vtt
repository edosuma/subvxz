WEBVTT

00:00.571 --> 00:02.108
And we are officially
out of here.

00:02.228 --> 00:04.195
Ladies of New York,
get ready for the return

00:04.230 --> 00:06.231
of the benjinator
and the tuckatron.

00:07.499 --> 00:09.267
Oh, do you hear that?

00:09.301 --> 00:11.950
That's the sound of two million
women rolling their eyes.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.140
Do not underestimate us.

00:16.175 --> 00:17.275
Alone we're impressive,

00:17.309 --> 00:19.410
but together, we're a force
to be reckoned with.

00:19.445 --> 00:21.179
Yeah. So are
the girl scouts.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.250
But have a good time.
I am all set.

00:25.284 --> 00:27.518
I have enough popcorn
and reality TV

00:27.553 --> 00:30.088
to last me until
Emma goes to college.

00:30.122 --> 00:31.456
Hey, thanks for staying.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.523
We haven't had a real bro night

00:32.558 --> 00:33.524
since Emma showed up.

00:33.559 --> 00:35.159
Yeah.

00:35.194 --> 00:38.129
Kids have a way of just
sucking the life out of you.

00:40.132 --> 00:41.332
All right, ready?

00:41.367 --> 00:42.533
Teeth.

00:42.568 --> 00:44.369
Nose.

00:44.403 --> 00:46.104
Breath.

00:47.306 --> 00:48.373
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

00:53.145 --> 00:54.312
- Oh my God, how much...
- Shh!

00:54.346 --> 00:55.513
Oh, sorry.
Emma. Right.

00:55.547 --> 00:57.415
No, not Emma.

00:57.449 --> 00:58.583
Mom.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.226
Sweet. The return
of fu mom-chu.

01:10.296 --> 01:11.529
- Picture?
- Yeah.

01:15.167 --> 01:17.535
- Good night?
- Oh my God. The best, man.

01:17.569 --> 01:19.437
One of the bouncer's
cousin's boyfriend's

01:19.471 --> 01:21.172
sister's works with Ben.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.074
Okay? So we pretty much
sailed right in.

01:23.108 --> 01:24.509
The place was wall to wall.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.144
I lost Tucker
for, like, 40 minutes

01:26.178 --> 01:27.412
when he got passed over
the top of the mosh pit.

01:27.446 --> 01:29.514
Drunken mobs, okay.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.249
Kinda handsy.

01:31.283 --> 01:33.084
But it was so worth it
'cause they dropped me

01:33.118 --> 01:34.452
right in front
of this crazy hot girl.

01:37.122 --> 01:39.157
Oh. I have not
heard these details.

01:39.191 --> 01:41.426
Oh, dude. She thought
I was hilarious.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.294
Of course.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.296
Listen, she just
moved here from L.A.

01:45.331 --> 01:47.131
Man, long dark hair,

01:47.166 --> 01:48.266
just gorgeous smile,

01:48.300 --> 01:49.467
- her name was...
- Ava?

01:49.501 --> 01:50.501
Yeah.

01:50.536 --> 01:53.071
Wait, how did you know...

01:53.105 --> 01:55.106
I'm going out with her
tomorrow night.

02:01.447 --> 02:04.449
â™ª It's amazing
how the unexpected â™ª

02:04.483 --> 02:08.086
â™ª can take your life
and change directions. â™ª

02:11.813 --> 02:13.914
Wait, so you actually
made a date with Ava?

02:13.948 --> 02:15.749
Well,
not an actual date,

02:15.783 --> 02:16.883
but she said I should call her.

02:16.918 --> 02:17.918
And I'm pretty sure
it's not to see

02:17.952 --> 02:19.653
if her phone works.

02:19.687 --> 02:22.522
Okay. I know
I just met her,

02:22.557 --> 02:23.857
but I feel like
I can speak for her.

02:23.891 --> 02:24.958
Okay.

02:27.895 --> 02:29.763
She was not into you.

02:29.797 --> 02:30.997
Then let's hope
I don't get my heart broken

02:31.032 --> 02:31.998
when I call her.

02:32.033 --> 02:33.567
Which she asked me to do.

02:33.601 --> 02:34.768
- Okay?
- Okay.

02:34.802 --> 02:36.770
You are not
calling my girl, okay?

02:37.839 --> 02:38.872
Hey!

02:38.906 --> 02:39.906
No one is calling anyone.

02:41.742 --> 02:43.677
But I didn't even
bring my swimsuit.

02:46.714 --> 02:47.914
No one is calling anyone.

02:47.949 --> 02:49.816
Learn from my mistakes.

02:49.851 --> 02:50.951
When I played in calgary,

02:50.985 --> 02:53.620
I fought over a girl
with one of my teammates.

02:53.654 --> 02:55.555
Sure. I got the girl,

02:55.590 --> 02:56.656
but I lost the guy.

02:56.691 --> 03:00.827
Then I lost the girl, too.

03:00.862 --> 03:03.597
Then I lost my phone.

03:03.631 --> 03:04.698
It was a really bad week.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.701
You're right.
I get it.

03:07.735 --> 03:09.636
Tucker, what do you say?

03:09.670 --> 03:11.571
Fine.

03:11.606 --> 03:12.973
Neither of us will call her.

03:13.007 --> 03:14.808
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

03:14.842 --> 03:16.509
Agreed?

03:16.544 --> 03:17.611
I said agreed.

03:18.946 --> 03:20.947
I'm up!

03:20.982 --> 03:22.649
What did I miss?

03:27.922 --> 03:29.890
You fu mom-chued me,
didn't you?

03:34.695 --> 03:35.862
Mom?

03:35.897 --> 03:37.797
Were you on
my computer last night?

03:37.832 --> 03:38.932
Oh, yeah, honey.

03:38.966 --> 03:40.000
And you know what?
You should really make a habit

03:40.034 --> 03:41.668
of erasing your history.

03:41.702 --> 03:44.704
You never know who's
gonna be snooping around.

03:44.739 --> 03:45.906
That's excellent advice,

03:45.940 --> 03:48.642
hotbon79.

03:51.679 --> 03:53.580
Is this your online
dating profile?

03:53.614 --> 03:55.615
Yes. Yes, it is.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.017
And there is
nothing to be ashamed of.

03:57.051 --> 03:58.551
I have nothing to hide.

03:58.586 --> 03:59.853
It says you're a widow.

03:59.887 --> 04:01.688
Yeah, well, your father's
kind of dead to me.

04:05.626 --> 04:06.893
And for age,
you said that you're...

04:06.928 --> 04:07.928
aah!

04:09.764 --> 04:10.897
You listen up, little miss,

04:10.932 --> 04:12.666
you ain't gonna
look like that forever.

04:13.834 --> 04:14.868
Yeah, you heard me.
Enjoy those

04:14.902 --> 04:16.603
while they're up high.

04:18.005 --> 04:20.974
This is how
online dating works, okay?

04:21.007 --> 04:22.776
Everybody lies.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.978
It's like the weight
on your driver's license.

04:25.012 --> 04:27.013
It's more of a suggestion.

04:29.884 --> 04:32.686
So I would appreciate
a little support

04:32.720 --> 04:35.555
while I am trying
to restart my life.

04:35.589 --> 04:37.991
My life is officially over.

04:38.025 --> 04:39.626
Mine too.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.727
Mom, robe.

04:40.761 --> 04:42.829
Oh, God. Sorry.

04:42.863 --> 04:45.765
The rangers are having
a big media day,

04:45.800 --> 04:47.968
and the front office wants me
to give some kind of speech.

04:48.002 --> 04:49.869
Oh, how fun.

04:49.904 --> 04:51.538
Have you seen Danny on camera?

04:51.572 --> 04:53.006
He looks like the deer
after it got hit by that car.

04:56.043 --> 04:57.043
I'm not doing it.

04:58.713 --> 05:00.847
Could you people possibly
be less supportive?

05:00.881 --> 05:03.683
Yeah, but it's early.
I'm still waking up.

05:08.756 --> 05:09.856
Hey.

05:09.890 --> 05:11.658
Wheeler,

05:11.692 --> 05:13.493
relax.

05:13.527 --> 05:14.761
You make people bleed
for a living,

05:14.795 --> 05:17.864
I'm pretty sure you can handle
a little public speaking.

05:17.898 --> 05:19.833
Crushing bones, easy.

05:19.867 --> 05:21.968
Putting words one after
another, no thank you.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.638
Okay, well, then
let me help you.

05:25.673 --> 05:26.906
I just took
this mock trial seminar,

05:26.941 --> 05:29.509
and I was pretty much
the star of the class.

05:29.543 --> 05:31.945
I'm not out of order.
You're out of order!

05:31.979 --> 05:35.648
This whole system
is out of order!

05:35.683 --> 05:36.983
You just made that up?

05:37.018 --> 05:39.519
See, I could never do that.

05:39.553 --> 05:41.855
But you can.

05:41.889 --> 05:42.956
I just wish you could
see yourself

05:42.990 --> 05:44.691
the way that I see you.

05:45.926 --> 05:47.827
How do you see me exactly?

05:48.996 --> 05:51.865
You're an amazing,
loving, big-hearted guy

05:51.899 --> 05:53.867
who's passionate about
everything that he does.

05:53.901 --> 05:56.603
That's me.
Full of passion.

05:57.805 --> 05:59.539
We just need to
hunker down together.

05:59.573 --> 06:02.509
Fortunately,
I'm an excellent hunkerer.

06:02.543 --> 06:04.644
Okay, then it's perfect.

06:04.678 --> 06:05.912
It's time you stopped
holding back.

06:05.946 --> 06:07.914
I was just thinking
the same thing.

06:07.948 --> 06:09.549
Then it's a date.

06:09.583 --> 06:10.583
I won't let you down.

06:17.658 --> 06:18.858
What was that all about?

06:18.893 --> 06:21.761
Riley just had
a few ideas for me.

06:21.796 --> 06:24.697
Yeah. It looked like you had
a few ideas for her too.

06:24.732 --> 06:25.932
What?

06:25.966 --> 06:27.700
No. No ideas.

06:27.735 --> 06:28.802
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

06:28.836 --> 06:30.637
Look at me and tell me

06:30.671 --> 06:33.573
that you don't
have a crush on fatpants.

06:34.975 --> 06:36.743
- I can't.
- Why not?

06:36.777 --> 06:38.578
- Your robe.
- Oh, God, sorry.

06:42.883 --> 06:44.551
Oh, no, no, no, honey.

06:44.585 --> 06:45.852
I know you like daddy's phone,

06:45.886 --> 06:47.654
but the last time
yov baby dialed someone,

06:47.688 --> 06:48.788
the police showed up.

06:50.024 --> 06:52.692
Look, you almost called Ava.

06:58.699 --> 06:59.833
You almost called Ava.

07:01.602 --> 07:02.936
Tucker!

07:04.004 --> 07:05.839
Tuck?

07:05.873 --> 07:06.940
Okay, here's daddy's phone.

07:06.974 --> 07:08.541
Okay?

07:08.576 --> 07:09.809
If you just hit right here,

07:09.844 --> 07:11.845
okay? Right...

07:11.879 --> 07:13.880
Hold on, right here.

07:13.914 --> 07:15.648
If you just, uh, okay...

07:15.683 --> 07:16.749
right here.

07:16.784 --> 07:17.917
No, Emma. Focus.

07:17.952 --> 07:20.920
Okay? Just...
just right there.

07:22.022 --> 07:23.623
Yes!

07:26.961 --> 07:27.927
Hello?

07:29.563 --> 07:31.531
Ben? Is anybody there?

07:31.565 --> 07:33.566
Hello?

07:36.670 --> 07:38.872
Oh, please please please
please please please.

07:40.975 --> 07:42.675
It seems
we have a call.

07:45.713 --> 07:46.713
Hello?

07:46.747 --> 07:48.581
Ava?

07:49.850 --> 07:51.718
Oh, yeah.
So nice of you to call.

07:55.089 --> 07:56.623
What's up?

08:00.895 --> 08:02.929
Well, you're definitely
not the first guy

08:02.963 --> 08:04.797
to ask me to meet him at a bar,

08:04.832 --> 08:07.534
but you are the first guy
I feel like I should tip.

08:07.568 --> 08:08.668
I don't usually do this,

08:08.702 --> 08:10.737
but it happens to be
bring your date to work day.

08:10.771 --> 08:12.639
Plus, I was already on my way
here when you called me.

08:12.673 --> 08:13.773
When you called me.

08:13.807 --> 08:14.908
When Emma...

08:14.942 --> 08:16.976
it's not important.

08:17.011 --> 08:18.778
So, what do you think
of New York so far?

08:18.812 --> 08:19.812
I like it.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.948
Great energy, good food...

08:21.982 --> 08:23.016
Cute guys.

08:23.050 --> 08:25.018
Been talking to a lot of those?

08:25.052 --> 08:27.720
I'm not gonna tell you
all my secrets.

08:27.755 --> 08:29.822
Unless you make me
another one of these.

08:29.857 --> 08:30.990
I'll be right back.

08:33.928 --> 08:35.995
Ava, your phone.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.735
Hello, Tucker.

08:47.151 --> 08:49.186
I didn't call her.
I texted her.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.121
And then she texted me back
to call her.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.124
So technically,
I was returning her text.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.927
That is not what we agreed.

08:56.961 --> 08:59.162
I at least have the decency
to have Emma call for me.

08:59.197 --> 09:01.098
Oh.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.868
I want you to know
that this is not over, okay?

09:04.902 --> 09:05.936
You have not won.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.971
I am calling Ava,
and we are going out.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.873
She can compare and contrast
all she wants,

09:09.907 --> 09:11.775
I ain't got no issues.

09:13.778 --> 09:17.047
You're really willing
to go up against this?

09:18.983 --> 09:21.051
Fine. May the best man win.

09:21.085 --> 09:23.153
Best man? Oh, then
that'll definitely be you

09:23.187 --> 09:25.122
at my and Ava's wedding.

09:25.156 --> 09:26.890
Oh.

09:26.924 --> 09:28.091
Wear something nice.

09:30.728 --> 09:33.163
This is Riley perrin,
hairbrush news network.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.098
I'm thrilled to be talking
with New York ranger,

09:35.133 --> 09:36.767
Danny Wheeler.
Danny?

09:36.801 --> 09:37.768
Tell me what it's like
to be a part

09:37.802 --> 09:39.035
of this exciting team.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.872
Well,

09:41.906 --> 09:43.039
the thing is...

09:43.074 --> 09:45.075
Uh...

09:45.109 --> 09:46.810
I don't know what
you want me to say.

09:47.945 --> 09:49.746
Okay. Too advanced.

09:49.781 --> 09:52.716
Um. We'll start
with the basics.

09:52.750 --> 09:53.750
Stand up.

09:54.852 --> 09:56.820
We'll do a little deep
breathing to focus us.

09:56.854 --> 09:58.155
All right?
Deep breath.

09:59.957 --> 10:00.957
No, no, no, here.

10:00.992 --> 10:02.759
From your diaphragm.

10:02.794 --> 10:04.895
Wow. Do you grate
cheese on this thing?

10:06.164 --> 10:07.764
Here.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.032
Feel how I'm doing it.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.033
Comfortable?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.935
Very.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:21.145 --> 10:22.145
Whoa.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.780
Wheeler, you okay?

10:23.815 --> 10:26.183
You got all slack-jawed
there for a minute.

10:26.217 --> 10:28.151
Let's try not to drool on me.

10:28.186 --> 10:29.186
Focus.

10:33.157 --> 10:34.191
Your son is an idiot.

10:34.225 --> 10:36.092
Really gonna have to
narrow it down.

10:36.127 --> 10:38.128
Ben?

10:38.162 --> 10:39.262
Where are my pants?

10:39.297 --> 10:40.831
Which ones?

10:40.865 --> 10:41.932
All of them.

10:41.966 --> 10:43.266
Oh, I might've run
a few things down

10:43.301 --> 10:44.801
to the laundromat.

10:44.836 --> 10:47.070
I'm meeting Ava in 20 minutes.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.873
Ooh. Argh.

10:51.843 --> 10:53.877
That could be awkward.

10:53.911 --> 10:54.911
Say "hi" for me.

10:56.214 --> 10:58.281
Hey, man. She gonna see me
without pants sooner or later.

10:58.316 --> 10:59.916
You're just
saving me some time.

11:02.987 --> 11:03.987
Oh, hi, honey.

11:13.998 --> 11:16.032
Maybe it's that
mother-child bond

11:16.067 --> 11:18.935
finally kicking in, but I'm getting
the sense you want to talk.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.006
It's Riley.
You were right.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.108
I do like her.
I've always liked her.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.143
Oh, I knew it!

11:27.178 --> 11:29.846
Oh, wait. So is that
what you guys were doing

11:29.881 --> 11:31.147
every day up in your room
after school?

11:31.182 --> 11:33.817
"Get out, mom.
We're studying."

11:34.852 --> 11:36.786
Nothing has ever happened.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.054
She doesn't even know.

11:38.089 --> 11:39.823
Though I did
just try to kiss her.

11:40.892 --> 11:44.027
Oh my God!
I just tried to kiss Riley.

11:44.061 --> 11:45.095
What's wrong with me?

11:45.129 --> 11:46.963
Well, apparently
you're a boy in love.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.899
But I don't want to be.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.868
Or... I want her to be.

11:51.903 --> 11:53.870
Yeah, that's better.

11:53.905 --> 11:56.239
Her in love with me.
That's what I want.

11:56.274 --> 11:59.809
Well, I'm sorry, honey, but you can't
make somebody fall in love with you.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.144
No matter how hard you try.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.847
If you could, my name
would be Bonnie bon jovi,

12:03.881 --> 12:06.149
and I'd be floating in a hot
tub, topless right now, so...

12:10.054 --> 12:11.154
mom.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.856
Oh.

12:12.890 --> 12:14.190
What am I supposed to do?

12:14.225 --> 12:16.826
Well, be grateful
that you have a friend

12:16.861 --> 12:19.129
as devoted and caring as Riley.

12:20.831 --> 12:21.965
Oh, hey, man.

12:26.971 --> 12:28.204
Borrowing these.
Hope you don't mind.

12:28.239 --> 12:29.940
Tuckeokay?

12:29.974 --> 12:32.142
Got a date to get to,
you... oh my God!

12:35.046 --> 12:37.113
Trust me, Danny. Good
friends are hard to find.

12:37.148 --> 12:40.116
However, stupid ones
are lying all over the place.

12:47.992 --> 12:49.893
Going somewhere?

12:49.927 --> 12:51.962
Yeah, as soon as
my mom gets here, I was...

12:51.996 --> 12:53.163
hoping to meet Ava
down at the club?

12:53.197 --> 12:54.965
I heard she was
gonna be there, too.

12:54.999 --> 12:56.866
Dude, come on.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.234
It's gonna get really weird
if we both show.

12:58.269 --> 13:00.737
Oh, well, fortunately
that's not gonna happen.

13:00.771 --> 13:03.106
Because your mom's
at the cell phone store

13:03.140 --> 13:06.743
replacing her battery
that mysteriously disappeared.

13:06.777 --> 13:07.777
Oh. Oh.

13:10.848 --> 13:11.948
You'll never
get away with this.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.818
Oh, I believe I just did.

13:14.852 --> 13:15.986
Excuse me.

13:16.020 --> 13:18.154
Oh.

13:18.189 --> 13:20.724
Forgot my lip balm.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.826
Definitely gonna need this.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.845
You're a really good dancer.

13:41.879 --> 13:43.847
I just needed some inspiration.

13:43.881 --> 13:44.948
What?

13:44.982 --> 13:46.750
Inspiration.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.818
Yeah, me too. It's
pretty hot in here.

13:51.088 --> 13:53.757
- Ava, hey.
- Ben.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.759
What a surprise. You want
to get something to drink?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.060
I'm kind of with somebody.

13:57.094 --> 13:59.763
Oh, sorry. I didn't
see him there.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.698
Ben, Tucker.
Tucker, Ben.

14:01.732 --> 14:03.867
Hey, what's up, man?

14:03.901 --> 14:04.968
Where's Emma?

14:05.002 --> 14:06.703
I got it covered.

14:06.737 --> 14:07.971
What you think, Emma?

14:08.005 --> 14:09.005
This guy look 21?

14:11.008 --> 14:12.709
Do you two know each other?

14:12.743 --> 14:14.811
- No.
- Never seen him before.

14:14.845 --> 14:17.147
Okay, well, I guess I'll
talk to you some other time.

14:17.181 --> 14:20.083
Right. Yeah.

14:20.117 --> 14:21.785
Another time.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.952
Run along now.

14:41.038 --> 14:43.039
Wow. He's
really good.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.055
- Ava.
- Ava, wait.

15:32.089 --> 15:34.824
Okay, that was just
full on weird.

15:34.859 --> 15:37.060
Here's the truth.

15:37.094 --> 15:38.094
We're roommates.

15:39.163 --> 15:41.731
We don't have to be.

15:41.766 --> 15:42.832
So don't let that
stand in the way

15:42.867 --> 15:44.768
of you and me
fulfilling our destiny.

15:44.802 --> 15:48.705
Dating two guys was already a
little out of my comfort zone.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.073
But, roommates?

15:50.107 --> 15:51.074
I don't think so.

15:51.108 --> 15:52.742
Wait.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.044
We weren't trying
to lie to you.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.781
It's just, we both think
you're pretty special.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.816
And obviously
worth fighting for.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.719
Look, there's no reason
that one of us

16:02.753 --> 16:03.887
shouldn't at least
get to know you better.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.088
If that's cool with you.

16:05.122 --> 16:07.757
You guys want me to choose?

16:07.792 --> 16:09.025
Right now?

16:09.059 --> 16:10.760
Are you sure?

16:10.795 --> 16:12.061
Don't worry.
He's tough.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.096
He can take it.

16:18.068 --> 16:19.969
I guess I pick Tucker.

16:20.004 --> 16:21.070
Ha! In your...

16:21.105 --> 16:22.105
what?!

16:30.648 --> 16:32.783
do not need to have
this conversation.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.718
I'm cool.

16:34.752 --> 16:36.520
She picked you.
Winner, loser.

16:36.554 --> 16:37.588
I get it.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.591
Don't understand it.
But I get it.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.627
I just wanted to make sure
if you were okay

16:43.661 --> 16:45.629
if Ava came by
the apartment later.

16:45.663 --> 16:47.464
No issues whatsoever.

16:47.498 --> 16:49.633
Mainly because I'll be at
Danny's press conference.

16:49.667 --> 16:50.968
Oh, and lucky you...
mom will have Emma,

16:51.002 --> 16:52.936
so the place is totally yours.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.972
What is your problem?

16:55.006 --> 16:56.974
I thought you said
you were cool with this.

16:57.008 --> 16:59.576
I am cool.

16:59.611 --> 17:00.677
This is me being cool.

17:03.615 --> 17:04.848
Would you mind if I borrowed
some of that new cologne...

17:04.883 --> 17:05.983
I'm not that cool.

17:10.888 --> 17:12.656
Wheeler?

17:12.690 --> 17:14.625
Wow. You look amazing.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.893
What do you think?

17:15.926 --> 17:17.694
Does this say
sports professional?

17:17.729 --> 17:20.731
That, or superhero in disguise.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.767
You're gonna be so great.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.569
Thanks.

17:25.603 --> 17:28.839
And, Riley, I don't know
if I've ever said this before...

17:28.873 --> 17:30.874
I'm really grateful
to have you in my life.

17:30.909 --> 17:32.609
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

17:32.644 --> 17:34.611
Aw.

17:34.646 --> 17:37.614
Then let's hope you never
have to find out.

17:38.683 --> 17:39.850
Hey, am I late?
Did I miss anything?

17:39.884 --> 17:41.685
Hey, perfect timing.

17:41.719 --> 17:42.786
I think he's up next.

17:42.820 --> 17:44.755
Next?

17:44.789 --> 17:47.557
Oh! Is it hot in here?

17:47.592 --> 17:49.693
I think I'm gonna sit down.

17:49.727 --> 17:51.728
You're gonna be fine.

17:51.763 --> 17:52.729
Where's Tucker?

17:52.764 --> 17:53.864
Where do you think he is?

17:53.898 --> 17:56.733
Busy starring in
"the Tucker show."

17:56.768 --> 17:58.602
You invited him
like I asked you to?

17:58.636 --> 17:59.870
No.

18:00.905 --> 18:01.939
It's not like
he'd come anyways.

18:01.973 --> 18:03.507
He's too busy with Ava.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.543
Dude. What is
the matter with you?

18:06.577 --> 18:08.679
This is exactly what I
told you would happen.

18:08.713 --> 18:09.880
You guys are a team.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.649
And being on a team means
you have each other's back.

18:12.684 --> 18:13.884
That no matter
how you're playing,

18:13.918 --> 18:15.786
someone's always there
to celebrate your wins

18:15.820 --> 18:17.721
and avenge your losses.

18:17.755 --> 18:18.889
Without a team,

18:18.923 --> 18:21.491
you're just some loser
out there alone on the ice.

18:21.526 --> 18:23.660
And that's not
how you play hockey.

18:23.695 --> 18:24.828
Or life.

18:29.767 --> 18:30.867
Go rangers.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.602
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Go rangers!

18:32.637 --> 18:33.804
Woo.

18:33.838 --> 18:36.807
Oh my God.
Danny, you were amazing.

18:36.841 --> 18:37.808
You did it.

18:37.842 --> 18:39.843
- I did?
- Yeah.

18:39.877 --> 18:41.845
I did. Thank you.

18:44.983 --> 18:46.583
ReporteWheeler, over here.

18:46.617 --> 18:47.617
Yeah.

18:54.726 --> 18:55.859
Well, that was rousing.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.864
I'll say.

19:00.898 --> 19:02.499
Just like we practiced.

19:05.670 --> 19:06.770
I should go.

19:06.804 --> 19:07.804
I feel like I've
been playing goalie

19:07.839 --> 19:08.905
against my own team.

19:10.641 --> 19:11.708
Oh, what?
He's the only one

19:11.743 --> 19:13.577
who can use sports
analogies? Pfft!

19:20.685 --> 19:22.619
Ben? Did you
forget your key?

19:22.653 --> 19:24.588
I didn't want to
barge in on whatever

19:24.622 --> 19:25.889
might or might not
be happening.

19:27.725 --> 19:28.892
I just wanted to tell you that

19:28.926 --> 19:30.527
you deserve a great girl

19:30.561 --> 19:31.628
and an even better friend.

19:31.662 --> 19:34.498
Thanks, man.

19:34.532 --> 19:35.532
But about that.

19:41.939 --> 19:43.607
Okay.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.842
That girl is crazy.
You have got to help me, man!

19:47.779 --> 19:49.946
She has not stopped talking
since she got here.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.815
I think I am deaf in one ear.

19:55.753 --> 19:56.920
All right, here's
what we'll do.

19:56.954 --> 19:58.655
We just have to
turn her off of you...

19:58.689 --> 20:00.924
oh, please.
Like that's possible.

20:00.958 --> 20:04.561
Felon. Gun nut.

20:04.595 --> 20:05.695
Head lice.

20:05.730 --> 20:06.897
Cult.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.933
Hey, guys.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.635
- Danny?
- Sold.

20:11.669 --> 20:12.636
Everything good out here?

20:12.670 --> 20:13.670
Oh, it's about to be.

20:13.704 --> 20:14.871
Okay, come here.
Okay.

20:16.541 --> 20:17.941
Ava, hey. This is
Ben's brother,

20:17.975 --> 20:19.709
Danny Wheeler.
New York ranger.

20:19.744 --> 20:20.977
Oh my God, I love hockey!

20:21.012 --> 20:22.979
I could talk about it
for hours.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.549
I figured. Okay.

20:25.583 --> 20:26.850
Okay, yeah.

20:26.884 --> 20:28.518
If you could just
keep her company

20:28.553 --> 20:29.920
while we go run out
for more...

20:29.954 --> 20:31.655
- beer?
- Beer sounds great.

20:31.689 --> 20:32.756
Sure, no problem.

20:34.859 --> 20:35.992
Thank you, man.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.627
That was genius.

20:37.662 --> 20:39.629
Hey, man.
I always got your back.

20:39.664 --> 20:40.964
One thing Ava
was right about...

20:40.998 --> 20:42.866
that dance off was weird.

20:42.900 --> 20:43.900
Oh, you are...

20:48.104 --> 20:50.372
Which fyi was two of my
nicknames in high school.

20:52.475 --> 20:54.476
I'm a 40-and-fab city gal

20:54.510 --> 20:56.445
who's living with
early onset grandmahood.

20:56.479 --> 20:58.113
Divorced, oh yeah.

20:58.147 --> 21:00.315
Unemployed? Not if
you count how I work it.

21:02.151 --> 21:03.385
I like... I like fondue.

21:03.419 --> 21:05.353
Anytime you can dip food
in other food,

21:05.388 --> 21:07.055
that's game on.

21:08.458 --> 21:11.193
If you're man enough
to take this on,

21:11.227 --> 21:13.228
contact hotbon79.

21:13.262 --> 21:14.463
Also, you need to be

21:14.497 --> 21:17.332
this tall to ride this ride.
