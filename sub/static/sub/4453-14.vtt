WEBVTT

00:00.012 --> 00:03.454
Previously, on AMC's Hell on Wheels...

00:04.483 --> 00:06.773
When those government inspectors

00:06.823 --> 00:08.587
order you to rebuild,

00:08.637 --> 00:11.428
it'll cost you a hell of
a lot more than Ogden.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.678
Take Ogden, if that'll
put an end to this!

00:13.728 --> 00:15.506
Did you have a hand in Chang's murder?

00:15.710 --> 00:17.228
You don't leave this
room till I get back.

00:17.416 --> 00:18.347
I love you, Cullen.

00:18.397 --> 00:20.785
Grant made you Secretary of the Interior

00:20.887 --> 00:22.687
to make judgment calls, not to...

00:22.789 --> 00:25.852
You'll get your judgment, Mr. Durant...

00:25.961 --> 00:27.176
but not today.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.619 --> 00:43.913
Tell me you haven't melted
it down and sold it already.

00:58.403 --> 01:01.214
The Union Pacific
provides the final spike,

01:01.264 --> 01:03.921
the Central Pacific nails
it down, like we agreed.

01:03.971 --> 01:08.796
I agreed to hold a ceremony at
the location of your choosing.

01:08.846 --> 01:10.982
Collis, the heaviest thing
you've lifted to date

01:11.032 --> 01:12.951
is a dessert spoon.

01:14.249 --> 01:18.003
You think my masculine capabilities
are insufficient, sir?

01:18.053 --> 01:21.159
I think you'd rather not
answer that question

01:21.209 --> 01:24.648
in front of 200 of Washington's finest.

02:28.426 --> 02:29.728
Mr. Lee?

02:31.996 --> 02:33.299
Mr. Lee?

02:34.385 --> 02:37.418
Wake up. Translate that.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.245
Need sleep, bossman.

02:42.540 --> 02:43.851
Translate.

02:48.023 --> 02:49.635
Address.

02:50.415 --> 02:52.093
In Ningpo.

02:53.770 --> 02:55.195
An address?

02:56.787 --> 02:58.036
China?

03:03.145 --> 03:04.750
Ribbed with iron,

03:04.800 --> 03:07.950
clad in silver, and crowned with gold,

03:08.000 --> 03:11.481
this spike will wed the oceans.

03:11.869 --> 03:13.685
Telegraphs

03:14.402 --> 03:19.549
in every major city will buzz
to life with the knowledge

03:19.599 --> 03:24.819
America's transcontinental
railroad is now complete.

03:26.819 --> 03:29.088
At the fall of my hammer,

03:29.263 --> 03:34.634
the operator will tap out
a three dot transmission.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.611
The message?

03:37.044 --> 03:38.374
One word...

03:40.530 --> 03:41.831
Done.

03:52.919 --> 03:54.405
Whiskey.

03:54.979 --> 03:56.957
You don't need another drink, mate.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.505
Hair of the dog.

04:02.837 --> 04:05.901
- Give the man a drink!
- Pipe down, ya traitor.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.131
What'd you say?

04:07.181 --> 04:09.844
For the love of Josephine,
can't a man sleep?

04:09.894 --> 04:12.609
- Whiskey damn it.
- I called you a traitor.

04:12.697 --> 04:14.297
And we don't serve C.P. here.

04:14.347 --> 04:15.550
Call me traitor again.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.207
It's over, there ain't no sides.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.406
All right?

04:18.670 --> 04:20.406
Except the side of whiskey.

04:20.654 --> 04:22.579
Just give him a drink,
for God's sake, Mick.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.791
Ah, shut up, Patrick.

04:23.841 --> 04:25.109
I told you all, there ain't no U.P.

04:25.159 --> 04:27.212
and there ain't no C.P., God damn it.

04:27.262 --> 04:29.623
Oi, the hell there ain't.

04:29.673 --> 04:32.414
Job or no job, I'm a Union Pacific man.

04:32.464 --> 04:35.453
Your pasty Mic ass'd still be down
a mine shaft if it weren't for me.

04:35.503 --> 04:37.234
Call me traitor again.

04:37.284 --> 04:38.851
Keep your voices down.

04:38.901 --> 04:40.779
I don't work for you, Bohannon.

04:44.329 --> 04:46.296
You mean the winning side?

04:50.868 --> 04:52.242
Hand to God,

04:52.564 --> 04:55.071
the next man who asks me for a drink,

04:55.121 --> 04:57.237
I swear I'll throttle him.

05:07.485 --> 05:08.968
Whiskey.

06:25.755 --> 06:27.554
Thank you, thank you.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.287
What the hell is this all about?

07:23.988 --> 07:25.721
Mr. Bohannon?

07:29.702 --> 07:30.844
Mick?

07:31.362 --> 07:32.595
I...

07:47.578 --> 07:49.655
Hell if we know.

07:58.165 --> 08:01.035
Congress requests your
presence in Washington

08:01.085 --> 08:04.495
to testify against Thomas
Durant on charges of bribery,

08:04.545 --> 08:06.628
fraud and corruption.

08:09.765 --> 08:11.636
Well, shit.

08:50.527 --> 08:51.721
I ain't going to Washington.

08:51.771 --> 08:53.313
You've been summoned by Congress.

08:53.363 --> 08:55.490
You tell Congress I've
a railroad to see to.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.100
Supplies to send West...

08:57.150 --> 08:58.591
The railroad is finished.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.272
President Grant is determined

09:01.496 --> 09:04.812
to see all those guilty of corruption
over its building punished

09:04.862 --> 09:06.823
to the full extent of the law.

09:12.536 --> 09:15.391
You're not yet an old man, Mr. Bohannon,

09:15.441 --> 09:17.699
but you are no longer young.

09:20.150 --> 09:22.356
I advise you to reflect

09:22.469 --> 09:25.003
on what it is you decide to do next,

09:25.537 --> 09:27.806
whose company you choose to keep.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.516
Your subsequent venture

09:30.639 --> 09:33.385
will likely determine
the shape of your life.

09:38.858 --> 09:41.088
A subpoena is not a request.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.309
A cavalry escort can be
arranged if need be.

10:07.928 --> 10:10.555
I'm buying out your
stake in the railroad.

10:12.541 --> 10:14.216
But I'm not selling.

10:14.977 --> 10:17.183
I've been indicted.

10:17.389 --> 10:19.728
News will hit the papers tomorrow.

10:19.802 --> 10:22.610
I want no record of your
involvement in the Union Pacific.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.205
I helped build the Union Pacific.

10:24.255 --> 10:27.174
You're associated with the Dead Rabbits.

10:27.224 --> 10:30.171
I'm compelled to cut ties.

10:32.257 --> 10:36.338
Your stock value by
tomorrow will plummet.

10:36.968 --> 10:41.889
Stick around, then you'll be
broke or in jail or both.

10:46.058 --> 10:47.983
I've buried bodies for you.

10:49.985 --> 10:54.650
I hope you don't want a
kiss goodbye, McGinnes.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.477
I'm not your father.

11:11.979 --> 11:13.662
I hope you hang.

11:24.463 --> 11:26.983
Eva, here you are.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.302
Sheets don't wash themselves,
Ms.Ellison.

11:29.352 --> 11:31.660
Need all the girls on their backs.

11:31.749 --> 11:34.619
Tricks'll dry up soon
as the workers leave.

11:37.185 --> 11:38.328
Hey!

11:38.573 --> 11:40.831
You want a roll, go round
the front, wait your turn.

11:40.881 --> 11:43.425
Oh, Eva, that's not a John.

11:43.475 --> 11:45.815
That's my editor from
the Chicago Tribune.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.930
He's very interested in you.

11:48.255 --> 11:49.956
I ain't on the menu.

11:50.053 --> 11:52.737
No, he's interested in your story.

11:52.906 --> 11:55.589
He wants me to help you
write it, in a book.

11:57.458 --> 12:00.203
Folks don't wanna read about a whore.

12:01.067 --> 12:03.539
It would be a story about a survivor

12:03.836 --> 12:05.604
and folks will love it.

12:05.654 --> 12:07.516
Folks will love you.

12:08.246 --> 12:10.588
That ain't been my experience.

12:10.654 --> 12:13.199
This could be a way in for you.

12:15.438 --> 12:16.777
Into what?

12:16.875 --> 12:18.501
Society.

12:19.224 --> 12:21.162
If that's what you want.

12:22.196 --> 12:23.964
Or anything, really.

12:24.014 --> 12:27.941
A best-selling authoress
can write her own ticket.

12:40.518 --> 12:43.524
Slow down, Mr. Bohannon, pack light.

12:43.574 --> 12:44.977
I need you back in San Francisco

12:45.027 --> 12:47.434
as soon as you're finished
with this Washington business.

12:47.484 --> 12:49.432
That well's deeper than you think.

12:49.482 --> 12:50.833
Careful you don't fall in.

12:50.883 --> 12:52.664
They're interested in Durant, not me.

12:52.714 --> 12:54.156
No, they're a hound with a scent.

12:54.206 --> 12:55.254
Once they've chewed through Durant,

12:55.304 --> 12:56.348
they'll come sniffing after us.

12:56.398 --> 12:58.545
I'm ahead of that problem.

13:03.042 --> 13:06.746
It was you, lit that little bonfire
in the C.P. Depot last night, huh?

13:10.188 --> 13:11.612
I got something for you.

13:11.889 --> 13:13.618
To commemorate the Golden Spike.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.238
Only four like it in the world.

13:15.288 --> 13:18.492
Go ahead, put it on, Mr.
Bohannon, you've earned it.

13:21.252 --> 13:22.582
Once you're back in San Francisco,

13:22.632 --> 13:25.172
we'll get started on
the Southern Pacific.

13:25.246 --> 13:26.569
Shortline?

13:27.186 --> 13:31.693
She doesn't have the romance of the
transcontinental, but don't write her off.

13:32.425 --> 13:34.121
She's just beginning.

13:34.991 --> 13:36.568
Plenty of roads to build yet.

13:36.618 --> 13:37.970
Oh, see that?

13:38.020 --> 13:40.049
Railroad man, through and through!

13:44.055 --> 13:47.727
MAY 10TH 1869

13:48.207 --> 13:49.895
All aboard!

14:30.552 --> 14:32.298
Thank you, sir.

14:35.605 --> 14:39.714
TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD
BUILT ON BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION

14:55.046 --> 14:56.365
Mr. Bohannon?

14:57.837 --> 15:00.648
Archibald Romans, Senior
White House Staff.

15:00.698 --> 15:04.042
I'm here to invite you to President
Grant's gala this evening.

15:04.109 --> 15:05.738
I ain't much for galas.

15:05.788 --> 15:08.660
In celebration of the
completion of the railroad.

15:09.071 --> 15:11.841
I come to testify, 
Mr.Romans, not socialize.

15:11.891 --> 15:14.730
The President has asked for
you personally, Mr. Bohannon.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.975
Grant knows I'm in town?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.143
Your stay at the Willard
Hotel has been compensated.

15:20.193 --> 15:23.130
Might I suggest you get
yourself checked in and 

15:23.274 --> 15:25.429
cleaned up before the soiree?

16:17.706 --> 16:20.882
I assume you've been
corralled into testifying

16:20.932 --> 16:22.559
at this circus tomorrow.

16:22.609 --> 16:26.136
I'm not at liberty to discuss
the hearing, Thomas.

16:26.922 --> 16:29.240
Congratulations on driving
the golden spike.

16:29.290 --> 16:33.954
I stand accused of bribing
government officials.

16:34.004 --> 16:36.070
That's officials like you.

16:36.519 --> 16:38.757
Now, I would advise you to say nothing,

16:38.807 --> 16:42.465
we're all in this together, Stephen.

16:43.039 --> 16:46.518
You've been away, so,
allow me to fill you in.

16:46.612 --> 16:48.639
You're poison in this town.

16:48.822 --> 16:51.021
And very much in this alone.

16:51.790 --> 16:54.027
Now, if you'll excuse me.

17:01.702 --> 17:03.304
Now these hands...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.449
Have built things.

17:06.911 --> 17:07.911
Ma'am.

17:07.961 --> 17:10.159
You're Cullen Bohannon, aren't you?

17:11.701 --> 17:13.477
The man of the hour.

17:13.921 --> 17:16.909
Quite an accomplishment,
this railroad of yours.

17:18.810 --> 17:19.672
Thank you ma'am.

17:19.722 --> 17:23.858
You're more handsome
than I ever imagined.

17:23.909 --> 17:28.099
You must tell me everything
about the Wild West.

17:28.979 --> 17:31.124
They say it isn't safe

17:31.409 --> 17:33.317
for a respectable woman.

17:38.503 --> 17:40.201
I'm sorry.

17:41.176 --> 17:42.942
I'm not in the right place.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.993
Margaret, your husband
is asking for you.

17:46.043 --> 17:47.966
Oh, George, he's a bore.

17:48.016 --> 17:50.603
And he's hopeless without you, my dear.

17:54.831 --> 17:58.182
Can't begrudge poor
Margaret for flirtations.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.881
That's her husband.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.281
Colonel George Armstrong Custer.

18:05.011 --> 18:08.530
Damn impressed with your accomplishment
on the railroad, Mr. Bohannon.

18:09.332 --> 18:11.611
Ten miles in a single day, was it?

18:11.661 --> 18:14.524
Well, had me one hell of a crew.

18:14.993 --> 18:18.040
You've the guts and countenance
of a good soldier, sir.

18:18.966 --> 18:20.797
Who did you serve?

18:22.783 --> 18:25.497
I rode under General
Nathan Bedford Forrest.

18:28.122 --> 18:29.514
Confederate.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.793
That's right.

18:34.802 --> 18:37.177
Shit, I led the charge against
you boys at Bull Run.

18:37.227 --> 18:38.801
Had you outnumbered and outgunned,

18:38.851 --> 18:42.266
but God damn if you didn't give
us one hell of a steeplechase.

18:43.130 --> 18:44.583
Where I come from, an
ass-whooping amounts

18:44.633 --> 18:46.844
to more than a steeplechase, Colonel.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.223
Come over here, boys.

18:50.858 --> 18:52.976
I want you to meet the
Grayback son-of-a-bitch

18:53.026 --> 18:55.839
who built ten miles of
iron road in a single day.

18:55.889 --> 18:57.749
To Mr. Cullen Bohannon...

18:58.722 --> 19:01.590
Toughest whoop-ass on the
transcontinental railroad.

19:05.095 --> 19:06.254
Thank you.

19:17.191 --> 19:20.302
He looks at me and he
says, "What's a poodle?"

19:24.025 --> 19:26.380
- Oh, now.
- Oh, at ease, gentlemen.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.457
Mr. Bohannon.

19:27.507 --> 19:29.472
You've met the Colonel, I see.

19:29.522 --> 19:31.788
Bohannon here was just
explaining the difference

19:31.838 --> 19:34.492
between a blood hound and a poodle.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.095
I got that right, Captain?

19:36.670 --> 19:38.384
Good enough for a Yankee.

19:38.674 --> 19:42.733
Have you boys heard how to tell
a good Yankee from a bad one?

19:43.939 --> 19:45.458
Mr. Bohannon?

19:45.610 --> 19:47.148
Why, that's simple, Mr. President.

19:47.198 --> 19:49.073
All the good Yankees go home.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.809
Let's go get some real food.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.129
Yes, sir. Nice to meet y'all.

20:17.654 --> 20:18.869
Oh, yes.

20:21.074 --> 20:23.436
Go ahead, eat it.

20:23.486 --> 20:27.875
Those frilled dainties they're serving
up there aren't fit to feed men.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.169
'Coffee'?

20:34.987 --> 20:36.060
Now,

20:37.115 --> 20:38.956
if you brought me down here to
talk about Thomas Durant...

20:39.006 --> 20:43.796
Oh, I have a Senator who will testify
to taking bribes from Doc Durant.

20:43.846 --> 20:47.156
Bad fruit left over from the
previous administration.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.831
I don't need your help cleaning house.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.672
We just here for the coffee then?

20:57.618 --> 21:00.701
I'd like to make you a Colonel
in the Fourth Cavalry.

21:01.315 --> 21:05.659
You'd be the Undersecretary of the Western
Territories for the United States Army.

21:05.709 --> 21:10.087
Your job would be to protect
the railroad you've built

21:10.420 --> 21:12.290
from all present threats.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.973
- You mean Indians.
- All threats, Mr. Bohannon.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.406
Cutthroats and train robbers.

21:17.719 --> 21:19.548
Cattle rustlers along the Texas border.

21:19.598 --> 21:21.668
And, yes, renegade Indians.

21:21.718 --> 21:23.508
I ain't no Indian killer.

21:25.011 --> 21:29.399
You're smart enough to prevent
bloodshed where possible,

21:30.301 --> 21:33.719
and not afraid to get your
hands dirty when necessary.

21:34.078 --> 21:37.064
You'd report to the
Secretary of the Interior.

21:40.210 --> 21:42.805
Sounds like you're asking
me to wear Union Blue.

21:43.623 --> 21:47.734
I'm asking you to wear
an American uniform.

21:48.380 --> 21:50.419
Your country needs you, Mr. Bohannon.

21:50.469 --> 21:52.207
Don't deny who you are.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.457
I'm a railroad man.

21:54.507 --> 21:56.413
Bullshit.

21:58.397 --> 22:00.119
You're a soldier.

22:00.482 --> 22:02.869
Lost without a war to fight.

22:08.097 --> 22:09.797
Ah, damn.

22:09.847 --> 22:12.095
I've got to go make a speech.

22:14.504 --> 22:15.765
Think it over.

22:16.820 --> 22:17.942
Yes, sir.

23:08.670 --> 23:14.009
A backwards rebel right at
home in the nation's capital,

23:15.787 --> 23:17.952
I never thought I'd see the day.

23:20.392 --> 23:22.700
Ain't nobody more
surprised than me, Doc.

23:23.836 --> 23:27.278
Never thought I'd see the day you'd be
itching for a train back to Hell on Wheels.

23:28.567 --> 23:32.282
They've turned a Senator.

23:34.166 --> 23:35.957
Several, probably.

23:37.133 --> 23:40.279
I don't know who, but
whatever hog they've got tied

23:40.329 --> 23:43.647
will squeal loud and clear.

23:46.285 --> 23:47.936
You've gotten outta
tighter spots than this.

23:47.986 --> 23:50.251
Grant needs a scapegoat.

23:51.956 --> 23:53.955
I'm out of allies.

23:57.696 --> 23:59.585
Maggie Palmer was right.

24:04.252 --> 24:05.780
She was a good woman.

24:07.772 --> 24:09.276
I loved her.

24:21.886 --> 24:23.947
They brought me here to testify.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.356
Say whatever you want.

24:34.037 --> 24:37.733
Enjoy your newfound favor

24:37.841 --> 24:41.136
because it will be over in an instant.

24:44.676 --> 24:47.014
Those men you were
laughing with in there,

24:47.279 --> 24:49.064
they're not your friends.

24:50.764 --> 24:52.914
They'll bleed you dry,

24:53.796 --> 24:56.652
toss you out with
yesterday's newspapers.

25:26.607 --> 25:29.064
I came to cash out my 10%.

25:30.432 --> 25:33.904
I've got a big labor contract
at the docks in San Francisco.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.417
I thought you'd come along.

25:37.385 --> 25:39.635
I ain't a labor contractor.

25:40.265 --> 25:42.293
Well, we'll keep the whores, then.

25:42.523 --> 25:44.822
Hell, we'll import new ones from France.

25:44.872 --> 25:46.599
I've big plans, Eva.

25:47.205 --> 25:48.883
We're only expanding.

25:50.355 --> 25:52.757
We ran a good enterprise.

25:53.034 --> 25:55.208
I'll always be thankful for that.

25:56.415 --> 25:58.755
But we're bad for each other, Mickey.

25:59.651 --> 26:01.056
Josie...

26:01.850 --> 26:03.752
- Shea...
- That was business.

26:06.425 --> 26:08.432
Then come to San Francisco.

26:13.064 --> 26:15.784
We stick together, it's a matter of time

26:15.834 --> 26:18.583
before one of us devours the other one,

26:18.633 --> 26:20.026
and you know it.

26:53.618 --> 26:55.129
Here you go then.

26:55.674 --> 26:57.142
Good luck to you.

26:58.456 --> 27:00.836
Me leaving's the closest thing
we got to a happy ending.

27:00.886 --> 27:02.829
Sounds like you've got it all sorted.

27:08.453 --> 27:10.319
Don't go sour on me.

27:11.208 --> 27:12.829
See yourself away.

28:02.507 --> 28:04.281
The President will see you now.

28:15.454 --> 28:19.488
...property, and free
political opinion...

28:26.064 --> 28:27.930
You've reached a decision.

29:00.264 --> 29:01.560
Perfect fit.

29:02.163 --> 29:03.201
Anything else, sir?

29:03.251 --> 29:05.220
No. No, thank you.

29:22.198 --> 29:24.269
Your name and title for the record.

29:24.406 --> 29:26.097
Cullen Bohannon.

29:26.662 --> 29:29.411
Stake-holder and Chief Engineer,
Central Pacific Railroad.

29:29.461 --> 29:31.048
Your current title, sir.

29:31.098 --> 29:34.072
Colonel, 4th Cavalry, U.S. Army.

29:34.122 --> 29:36.031
I'll cut right to it, sir.

29:36.909 --> 29:39.751
Have you ever witnessed Thomas Durant
offer an elected official a bribe,

29:39.801 --> 29:43.752
in form of stock or cash in
exchange for favorable legislation?

29:53.832 --> 29:55.914
The transcontinental railroad

29:57.412 --> 30:01.169
could not have been built
without Thomas Durant.

30:06.148 --> 30:07.585
That wasn't an answer.

30:07.635 --> 30:08.630
I'll ask again.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.132
As a former employee
of the Union Pacific,

30:11.182 --> 30:13.552
did Thomas Durant ever
voice his intention to

30:13.602 --> 30:16.485
or offer any bribes to
an elected official?

30:17.814 --> 30:20.759
The transcontinental railroad could not
have been built without Thomas Durant.

30:20.809 --> 30:23.779
Mr. Bohannon, you have sworn an oath

30:23.829 --> 30:26.828
before this committee
under penalty of perjury.

30:26.878 --> 30:32.245
We have a dozen Senators on record saying
Thomas Durant attempted to bribe them,

30:32.373 --> 30:35.704
are you disputing their
account of the facts?

30:35.871 --> 30:37.912
The fact I know to be true

30:38.579 --> 30:40.576
is that the transcontinental railroad

30:40.626 --> 30:43.932
could not have been built
without Thomas Durant.

30:43.982 --> 30:46.928
This committee has the authority
to hold you in contempt, Colonel.

30:46.978 --> 30:49.024
You have the right to
detain me, Governor,

30:49.262 --> 30:51.259
but that won't change the fact

30:51.411 --> 30:54.342
that the transcontinental railroad
could not have been built

30:54.392 --> 30:56.727
- without...
- Thomas Durant.

31:04.118 --> 31:06.160
Thank you, Colonel. That'll be all.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.679
The lecture circuit won't
know what hit them.

31:22.729 --> 31:25.698
First stop, Council Bluffs,
day after tomorrow.

31:25.748 --> 31:28.209
But the book isn't written yet.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.900
The book will come,
don't worry about that.

31:29.950 --> 31:33.648
In the meantime, your face tells
the story better than any book.

31:33.698 --> 31:35.935
Maybe we should go over the details.

31:35.985 --> 31:38.923
Yes. Walk us through it, Mrs. Toole.

31:39.356 --> 31:41.662
You were headed West with your family

31:41.712 --> 31:43.842
when you were attacked by Wild Mojave...

31:43.892 --> 31:46.274
- Yavapai.
- Sorry?

31:47.351 --> 31:48.641
It was...

31:50.021 --> 31:51.791
We was attacked by Yavapai.

31:51.841 --> 31:53.192
Apache.

31:53.242 --> 31:56.955
Then they traded me to the Mojave
for three blankets and a horse.

31:57.005 --> 31:59.390
Three blankets and a horse.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.526
The price of a human soul.

32:01.576 --> 32:02.889
Great detail. Possible title.

32:02.939 --> 32:04.323
Remember that, Ms. Ellison.

32:04.373 --> 32:08.800
So, the Mojave marked your
face and made you their slave.

32:08.850 --> 32:10.318
No. Not exactly.

32:10.368 --> 32:12.753
How would you describe it?

32:15.487 --> 32:16.717
They...

32:18.409 --> 32:21.129
Everyone had marks ..  but...

32:21.179 --> 32:25.048
The point is to let Mrs. Toole

32:25.098 --> 32:27.438
tell her story in her own words.

32:28.324 --> 32:29.638
Go ahead, Eva.

32:29.688 --> 32:31.416
We won't interrupt.

32:34.144 --> 32:36.542
It was hard at first

32:37.000 --> 32:38.938
because I missed my momma.

32:39.153 --> 32:41.132
But then I had me a Mojave...

32:45.981 --> 32:48.970
Had me a Mojave sister and...

32:51.920 --> 32:55.046
I'm sorry, this dress just
don't seem to fit right.

32:55.096 --> 32:57.782
But... but the dress is part of the story,

32:57.832 --> 33:01.383
it indicates you... You've been saved.

33:03.786 --> 33:05.461
Saved from what?

33:06.732 --> 33:09.224
From a life of savagery, of course.

33:13.031 --> 33:16.635
The marked face and the dress, we
can't have one without the other.

33:16.685 --> 33:18.612
Not now, Ed.

33:24.042 --> 33:25.159
I can't do this.

33:25.209 --> 33:26.511
Eva, we'll get a different dress.

33:26.561 --> 33:29.010
No, it ain't the dress.

33:31.279 --> 33:33.314
The railroad is finished, Eva.

33:35.022 --> 33:36.210
What else will you do?

33:36.260 --> 33:38.534
This is the best that you can hope for.

33:41.718 --> 33:44.493
Oh, God, I...

33:47.248 --> 33:48.964
I'm sorry. I...

33:56.060 --> 33:57.973
I love you, Louise.

33:59.301 --> 34:00.898
But I promised myself

34:00.948 --> 34:02.850
I'm done whoring.

34:04.943 --> 34:06.868
Good luck in Chicago.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.759
You're one hell of a shot.

34:25.543 --> 34:27.340
Plenty of practice.

34:27.389 --> 34:29.197
Too bad for the Apache.

34:29.678 --> 34:30.708
That's where you're heading, right?

34:30.759 --> 34:31.876
Arizona territory?

34:31.926 --> 34:33.664
Ship out tomorrow.

34:34.591 --> 34:37.045
Apache women are turned on by gore.

34:37.716 --> 34:40.126
Fornicate like rabbits
once the killing's done,

34:40.176 --> 34:42.036
you barely have to force them.

34:42.703 --> 34:45.568
Got myself a few trap
trophies from Arizona,

34:45.618 --> 34:47.661
had 'em stitched into coin purses.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.005
No.

34:49.495 --> 34:51.482
It ain't that kind of assignment.

34:52.813 --> 34:55.226
Just bringin' a couple
of renegades is all.

34:55.277 --> 34:56.967
Grant tell you that?

34:58.079 --> 35:00.802
He's a politician, I suppose he has to.

35:03.966 --> 35:05.453
You're a killer.

35:06.005 --> 35:08.219
You know what happens in the fog of war.

35:21.819 --> 35:23.912
Got to go see to the wife before I go.

35:23.962 --> 35:26.180
Keep up with my conjugal duties,

35:26.230 --> 35:28.229
lest she turn to the postman.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.148
You got yourself a girl?

35:33.808 --> 35:36.672
That's for the best. Keeps you focused.

35:37.755 --> 35:39.837
Don't worry about Grant's bullshit.

35:39.887 --> 35:41.545
You'll ship out, kill some Injuns,

35:41.595 --> 35:45.230
blam, blam, blam, then ride
back to Washington a hero.

35:45.804 --> 35:47.282
Nothing better.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.426
Bless you, my son.

37:36.220 --> 37:38.793
How long has it been since
your last confession?

37:48.273 --> 37:49.823
Are you a soldier?

37:52.754 --> 37:54.562
It's all right, my son.

37:54.706 --> 37:58.054
No man is without sin,
but you can be forgiven.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.382
Do you seek salvation?

38:18.776 --> 38:20.537
Do you wish to be saved?

39:03.469 --> 39:05.003
Thank you.

39:06.306 --> 39:08.036
Thank you.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.071
Thomas Durant will invoke
his fifth amendment right

39:15.121 --> 39:17.406
as secured by the constitution
of the United States.

39:17.456 --> 39:22.628
Mr. Durant, we have sworn testimony
corroborating the charges against you,

39:22.678 --> 39:27.814
am I clear you are choosing to let these
charges go unanswered by you here today?

39:28.584 --> 39:31.414
As is your constitutional right,

39:31.464 --> 39:34.623
so long as you're aware
the record of history

39:34.673 --> 39:38.024
will remember Thomas
Durant as a criminal.

39:38.129 --> 39:39.640
The record of history?

39:39.690 --> 39:41.247
That's right, Mr. Durant.

39:41.297 --> 39:42.731
My client will invoke his right...

39:42.781 --> 39:45.067
The record of history
will read, however,

39:45.117 --> 39:49.555
the handful of overfed
Senators in this room

39:49.605 --> 39:51.721
who choose to write it.

39:53.046 --> 39:55.862
I'm not interested in the
record of history...

39:55.912 --> 39:57.046
Mr. Durant, please.

39:57.096 --> 40:00.635
I am interested in reality.

40:01.342 --> 40:05.651
Not the one bandied inside
the halls of Congress,

40:06.326 --> 40:10.990
but the one I witnessed
with my own eyes out West.

40:12.927 --> 40:14.719
Five years ago,

40:14.931 --> 40:18.047
the American people, torn apart by war,

40:18.097 --> 40:21.938
cried out into the darkness
and turned a hopeful ear

40:21.988 --> 40:24.485
to the void for an answer.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.794
Americans needed a dream

40:28.809 --> 40:30.491
and I gave them one.

40:31.047 --> 40:34.150
A transcontinental
railroad that would unite

40:34.200 --> 40:36.685
this nation and its people.

40:39.279 --> 40:42.588
Dreams don't come pretty,

40:43.109 --> 40:44.060
they don't come clean

40:44.110 --> 40:46.709
and they sure as hell
don't come simple...

40:48.422 --> 40:49.996
They come true.

40:50.471 --> 40:53.666
Truth delivered by lies is no less true,

40:56.997 --> 41:03.027
and dreams made reality by
falsehood are no less real.

41:05.160 --> 41:09.668
1,776 miles of iron track,

41:09.718 --> 41:12.138
that is what I delivered!

41:12.188 --> 41:17.157
Track upon which thousands
of wheels will now revolve

41:17.301 --> 41:21.995
carrying on their axles the
wealth of half the world.

41:22.672 --> 41:25.965
Final Destination, San Francisco!

41:26.265 --> 41:28.885
Drawn by the Iron Horse,

41:29.077 --> 41:32.571
darkening the landscape
with his smoky breath

41:34.006 --> 41:38.224
announcing to the world
with its piercing scream

41:38.274 --> 41:43.516
that we are a great people who
can accomplish great things.

41:45.526 --> 41:48.587
Yet the American people,

41:49.004 --> 41:53.095
driven by their cowardly
representatives in Washington,

41:53.145 --> 41:55.392
are in need of a villain.

41:55.864 --> 41:57.456
And so here I sit,

42:00.854 --> 42:02.740
elected by you,

42:03.879 --> 42:05.444
to play my part...

42:07.781 --> 42:11.544
The part of the scapegoat.

42:12.382 --> 42:15.189
The patsy. Sent into the wilderness

42:15.518 --> 42:17.520
so that men sitting in this room

42:17.570 --> 42:19.838
can lay their sins upon my back,

42:19.888 --> 42:22.722
and claim they themselves are clean.

42:23.730 --> 42:29.284
Men enjoying immunity while
enriching themselves on the backs

42:29.334 --> 42:32.431
of those who sacrificed everything

42:33.159 --> 42:37.670
to make manifest America's destiny.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.975
Blood has been spilt.

42:40.504 --> 42:41.647
Lives have been lost.

42:41.697 --> 42:44.509
Men have been ruined.

42:45.266 --> 42:49.182
I saw it, and I survived.

42:57.364 --> 43:03.561
I will not return from the wild
having made America's dream a reality

43:03.746 --> 43:09.682
only to have six bureaucrats
in starched collars judge

43:09.732 --> 43:14.009
the manner in which I
realized that dream.

43:17.987 --> 43:22.648
Put me on trial, lock me in prison,

43:24.399 --> 43:26.395
erase me from the record.

43:29.825 --> 43:32.758
For history is written in pencil...

43:35.431 --> 43:41.272
And the truth is carved in
steel across this nation.

43:43.506 --> 43:47.407
And one truth above
all others is this...

43:49.955 --> 43:51.912
Without me and men like me...

43:51.962 --> 43:53.490
PASSAGE TO CHINA

43:53.540 --> 43:56.549
...your glorious railroad

43:56.918 --> 43:59.152
could never have been built.

45:04.154 --> 45:09.470

45:11.987 --> 45:14.491
To everyone who made Hell on Wheels...

45:14.541 --> 45:16.010
and to everyone who loves it...

45:16.060 --> 45:17.664
AMC says thank you,

45:17.714 --> 45:19.395
for a hell of a ride.
