His Dougie toys,
he's giving them all away.

Listen.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.390
You don't understand, man.

Listen, I wasn't rumbling with Dougie.

I was rumbling with the guy

Will, Nicky believes in Dougie
the same way he believes in Santa Claus.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.820
- So?
- Well, Dougie's his hero.

14:09.990 --> 14:12.010
Didn't you have heroes
when you were a kid?

14:12.190 --> 14:14.920
Yeah, Shaft.

14:15.860 --> 14:18.790
And how did you feel
when you found out that Shaft wasn't real?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.950
What are you talking about?

14:22.060 --> 14:25.000
No, I'm saying,
he was based on an actual guy.

No, he wasn't.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.700
He was too, Ashley.

14:28.870 --> 14:30.460
Shaft is fictional, Will.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.540
I'm saying, he went to Africa
and everything.

14:35.780 --> 14:38.270
Will, you can't tell Nicky
that Dougie isn't real.

14:38.450 --> 14:42.750
Why don't you take him down to the mall
and let him see you apologize to Dougie?

14:42.920 --> 14:45.390
I thought of that,
just he ain't there no more.

15:50.350 --> 15:55.260
Geoffrey, if I knew how to use the VCR,
would I need this camera?
