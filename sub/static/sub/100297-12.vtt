WEBVTT

00:02.152 --> 00:03.577
You know,

00:03.578 --> 00:04.967
life is so unfair. They got

00:04.969 --> 00:06.897
Snakes on a Plane, Dances with Wolves,

00:06.899 --> 00:08.031
The Elephant Man.

00:08.032 --> 00:11.493
When did they stop
making movies about cats?

00:11.495 --> 00:13.888
About a week after the
movie Cats came out.

00:15.591 --> 00:18.942
Hey, Joe. Joe. Shouldn't you
be helping me fix the truck?

00:18.944 --> 00:19.761
What are you talking about?

00:19.763 --> 00:21.503
We finished working on
the truck an hour ago.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.069
Oh, that's right. I think we probably

00:23.071 --> 00:26.341
forgot the part where you,
uh, pack up and go home.

00:26.343 --> 00:28.552
Come on, you had your
mechanic time with Joe.

00:28.554 --> 00:31.179
Now he and I get to have
our usual glass of wine

00:31.181 --> 00:32.281
and talk about poetry.

00:33.726 --> 00:36.369
The only poem Mike knows was,

00:36.371 --> 00:38.771
"There once was a man from Nantucket..."

00:39.857 --> 00:41.782
I like this one, though.

00:41.784 --> 00:45.694
"Before I start bitchin', why
don't you leave my kitchen?"

00:47.654 --> 00:50.654

00:52.411 --> 00:53.961
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:53.963 --> 00:55.388
Morning, Mikey.

00:55.390 --> 00:58.373
Mikey, how about a nice hot cup of joe?

01:00.544 --> 01:03.896
If it was the Joe I know,
it'd be dim and lifeless,

01:03.898 --> 01:05.714
and leave a bitter taste in your mouth,

01:05.716 --> 01:07.924
and I'd never be able to get rid of it.

01:07.926 --> 01:10.594
All right, what'd he do now?

01:10.596 --> 01:11.739
Well, apparently,

01:11.741 --> 01:13.889
- Joe and my wife have become friends.
- Oh?

01:13.891 --> 01:15.766
- She asked the dude over for dinner.
- Hmm.

01:15.768 --> 01:17.576
You know, Dante was incorrect.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.745
There are ten circles
of hell. One of them...

01:19.747 --> 01:22.415
is made of denim.

01:22.417 --> 01:24.583
He's lonely. He doesn't
have what we have.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.128
Love. Real love.

01:28.998 --> 01:30.781
- You know, Ed, I like you, but...
- Mm?

01:30.783 --> 01:32.908
I don't think we have real love.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.078
The man just needs a girlfriend.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.954
Yeah, fat chance of that.

01:37.956 --> 01:41.416
It'd be easier finding a cheap,
renewable source of energy.

01:41.418 --> 01:44.653
Who ordered the CeCe, extra saucy?

01:46.666 --> 01:49.910
Oh, Mandy. OMG.

01:49.912 --> 01:52.511
Those shoes are too
sexy for a married lady.

01:52.513 --> 01:53.588
Hey, hey,

01:53.590 --> 01:56.190
I may be married but
my feet aren't dead.

01:56.192 --> 01:58.600
Hey, girl, I am glad you're married.

01:58.602 --> 02:01.028
More men for me. Whoop whoop! Huh?

02:01.030 --> 02:04.147
Come on. Okay. All righty, then.

02:04.149 --> 02:07.201
Good morning, gentle-freaks.

02:09.205 --> 02:11.422
The room suddenly got very crowded.

02:13.392 --> 02:14.491
That CeCe, she's...

02:14.493 --> 02:17.211
a lot.

02:17.213 --> 02:19.546
Ooh, I am going to help myself

02:19.548 --> 02:21.331
to an everything bagel,

02:21.333 --> 02:23.050
because, like me,

02:23.052 --> 02:25.269
it can satisfy anyone.

02:26.505 --> 02:28.004
Hey, everybody.

02:28.006 --> 02:31.150
Oh, bagels, nice. I hope
there's an everything.

02:31.152 --> 02:34.845
Uh-oh, looks like I took the last one.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.155
Well, I think a lady like you

02:36.157 --> 02:38.473
should have the pick
of any bagel she wants.

02:38.475 --> 02:41.184
Oh, my goodness. What a gentleman.

02:41.186 --> 02:43.059
We could go halfsies.

02:43.061 --> 02:46.332
It would leave us both... wanting more.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.743
I don't believe I've had the
pleasure. My name is Joseph.

02:49.745 --> 02:51.745
They call me Joe.

02:51.747 --> 02:54.030
It's kind of a nickname I came up with.

02:54.032 --> 02:55.532
CeCe.

02:55.534 --> 02:58.135
That means, "yes yes".

02:59.922 --> 03:01.680
Yes, yes.

03:05.669 --> 03:08.503
But my favorite action fantasy series is

03:08.505 --> 03:10.338
The Promised Neverland.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.717
Demons breed humans to
be super intelligent.

03:13.719 --> 03:16.720
Because the smarter they are,
the more delicious they taste.

03:16.722 --> 03:20.055
Wow, that is so fascinating.

03:20.057 --> 03:22.821
Oh, but I feel like I've
been talking this whole time.

03:22.823 --> 03:25.067
Maybe we should move on to Kyle's topic.

03:25.069 --> 03:26.521
Uh, yeah, yeah, we will, we will.

03:26.523 --> 03:28.200
But I have one more question for you...

03:28.202 --> 03:29.508
Ooh.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.878
- What's that?
- Ah. That means that we are out of time.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.865
And my topic today was
unappreciated sidekicks.

03:36.867 --> 03:40.225
Yeah. Sorry, we were a
little off-topic today

03:40.227 --> 03:42.704
because we were talking
to Jen Zhen about

03:42.706 --> 03:45.520
the quickly evolving art
of Japanese graphic novels.

03:45.522 --> 03:47.512
And sitting here and not talking

03:47.514 --> 03:49.728
has been Kyle Anderson.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.996
Well, I'd like to thank both my guests.

03:51.998 --> 03:54.695
Jen, you were so refreshing,
so well-informed,

03:54.697 --> 03:56.643
just fantastic all around.

03:56.645 --> 03:58.617
And, uh, Kyle... thanks.

03:59.828 --> 04:01.609
You've been listening to Ryan Vogelson

04:01.611 --> 04:04.226
and this is: "Ry-Ry the Sci-Fi Guy".

04:05.896 --> 04:08.396
Bye-bye.

04:08.398 --> 04:11.658
Ah, I'm late for Geology Club.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.961
- Thanks for having me.
- Yeah, see you! Bye.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.671
- Bye, you guys!
- Yeah. Bye.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.999
Hey, sorry we ran out of time.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.759
But, uh, pretty good show, right?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.411
Yeah. Yeah, you and
Jen were great together.

04:23.413 --> 04:26.173
I almost could have stayed home.

04:26.175 --> 04:27.791
Come on. It was one show.

04:27.793 --> 04:29.435
You kill it every time you're on.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.437
You're a "Ry-Ry" favorite.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.089
- Ah, I guess.
- Hey, you want a sparkling water?

04:34.091 --> 04:36.722
I got your favorite flavor: purple.

04:36.724 --> 04:38.635
Okay.

04:38.637 --> 04:40.804
Jen took the last one.

04:40.806 --> 04:43.491
Oh, Jen is having quite
the day, isn't she?

04:47.158 --> 04:50.407
Honey, I'm wondering if we have
enough food for somebody else.

04:50.409 --> 04:51.624
I invited CeCe over,

04:51.626 --> 04:53.483
hoping that she and
Joe would hit it off.

04:53.485 --> 04:54.793
CeCe?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.778
What, the tall blonde, big laugh,

04:56.780 --> 04:58.822
always shouting "whoop whoop"?

04:58.824 --> 05:01.035
That would be CeCe.

05:01.037 --> 05:02.993
- Well, you really think she's right for Joe?
- Yeah.

05:02.995 --> 05:05.638
I mean, isn't she... a lot?

05:05.640 --> 05:06.830
Well...

05:06.832 --> 05:08.456
a lot of people say that about me.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.499
It's-it's actually a compliment.

05:09.501 --> 05:10.976
No, uh, it's not.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.257
Uh... No. Do you remember
the Outdoor Man picnic?

05:14.259 --> 05:16.298
She heckled everyone in the talent show.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.676
That's because the talent
at that show was horrible.

05:19.678 --> 05:22.062
Honey, they were children.

05:22.064 --> 05:24.064
Why are you fighting this?

05:24.066 --> 05:26.148
- I thought you'd want Joe to be happy.
- Well, honey,

05:26.150 --> 05:28.270
you don't care about your
friends, so somebody has to.

05:29.405 --> 05:31.479
- Just...
- All right. Well, hey.

05:31.481 --> 05:33.240
I will be watching her.

05:33.242 --> 05:35.409
And, uh...

05:35.411 --> 05:39.246
... there will be no l'amour
if she doesn't pass muster with me.

05:39.248 --> 05:41.206
Well, prepare to have
your muster passed.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.511
- Hey, Cees!
- 'Sup, Baxter.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.347
Lady Baxter.

05:48.349 --> 05:52.184
I came to drank, huh?! Whoop whoop!

05:52.186 --> 05:53.561
There you go.

05:59.474 --> 06:00.830
All right.

06:00.832 --> 06:02.816
Sorry, CeCe, I didn't
have the ingredients

06:02.818 --> 06:04.126
or enough butane for that

06:04.128 --> 06:07.032
Flaming Black Widow thing you ordered.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.017
- White wine? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:09.019 --> 06:10.373
- There you go. There you go, hon.
- Okay.

06:10.375 --> 06:13.280
The last party I was at
had a slide made of ice,

06:13.282 --> 06:14.872
- with vodka running down it.
- Oh.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.488
Oh, my... Wow.

06:16.490 --> 06:19.208
We all stood at the
bottom, just guzzling it.

06:19.210 --> 06:20.379
You know.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.714
Nice.

06:21.716 --> 06:24.258
Best funeral ever.

06:25.535 --> 06:27.553
You know what might be something to try?

06:27.555 --> 06:30.080
Like, a calming green tea
and a weighted blanket.

06:30.082 --> 06:31.557
- Mike...
- Um...

06:31.559 --> 06:32.999
- You know, CeCe...
- Yeah.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.542
... it's-it's great
that you like parties.

06:34.544 --> 06:38.114
But I've gotten to know Joe,
and he's-he's kind of a homebody.

06:38.116 --> 06:40.189
Well, I like the body part.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.334
- Come on.
- Come on.

06:44.336 --> 06:46.817
- Come on, you-you set her up.
- Yeah, okay.

06:46.819 --> 06:48.184
- What was she supposed to do?
- Yeah!

06:48.186 --> 06:49.688
Not go for the sleazy joke?

06:49.690 --> 06:51.379
Well, look.

06:51.381 --> 06:52.819
No, wait a minute. Joe is...

06:52.821 --> 06:54.154
- Joe is a sensitive guy.
- Yeah.

06:54.156 --> 06:56.434
I mean, did you know that
he wrote a children's book?

06:56.436 --> 06:58.158
- Children's book, huh?
- Yeah.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.086
So that means there's
no sex in it, then.

07:02.331 --> 07:04.673
Yikes. 50 shades of boring.

07:05.784 --> 07:08.246
Well, look, it's a kids'
book. There is no sex in it.

07:08.248 --> 07:10.789
She-She's just stating a
fact. You're a scientist.

07:10.791 --> 07:12.172
- You-you love facts.
- Well, look,

07:12.174 --> 07:14.749
here's a little fact about Joe.

07:14.751 --> 07:17.229
Uh, he absolutely dotes
on his elderly mother.

07:17.231 --> 07:19.273
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- He's a very, very caring person.

07:19.275 --> 07:21.014
Oh, well, I dote on my mother, too.

07:21.016 --> 07:23.633
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah. I designed her a sports bra

07:23.635 --> 07:25.969
to keep her sandbags from
hitting her in the face

07:25.971 --> 07:27.971
when she's Jazzercising, you know?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.436
She's not only caring. She paints a...

07:34.438 --> 07:36.029
a pretty picture, doesn't she?

07:36.031 --> 07:37.839
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Joe.

07:37.841 --> 07:39.482
- Hey, hi. -Oh!
- Sorry I'm late.

07:39.484 --> 07:42.127
Madonna threw up on my rug.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.514
Oh, my God, Joey.

07:43.516 --> 07:45.155
You party with Madonna?!

07:45.157 --> 07:46.740
- And Lady Gaga.
- Okay.

07:46.742 --> 07:50.377
Well, they... they're my cats, you know.

07:50.379 --> 07:53.880
It's, uh... It's not really a party.

07:53.882 --> 07:56.850
It's just a feather on
a stick kind of thing.

07:57.961 --> 07:59.794
- So you have cats.
- Yeah.

07:59.796 --> 08:00.962
Yeah, but he fixes cars.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.556
Y-You know, like guys do.

08:02.558 --> 08:05.517
Yeah, he-he has cats and a mom.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.560
Does that bother you?

08:06.562 --> 08:08.470
I love cats.

08:08.472 --> 08:12.157
My favorite breed is
the seal point Siamese.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.852
- Madonna is a seal point Siamese.
- Shut up.

08:15.854 --> 08:17.020
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:17.022 --> 08:18.405
Is it cat or a seal?

08:18.407 --> 08:19.998
It should make up its mind, right?

08:25.581 --> 08:27.822
You know what I hate?

08:27.824 --> 08:31.043
They don't make enough
movies about cats.

08:33.830 --> 08:36.347
This woman is amazing.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.000
You know, this is a lot of
fun. Actually a lot of fun.

08:39.001 --> 08:40.265
Uh, Joe, can I get you a beer?

08:40.267 --> 08:41.761
- Uh...
- Yeah, good, good.

08:41.764 --> 08:44.690
You want something to eat?
Like, maybe a slice of crow?

08:50.847 --> 08:52.364
Hey.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.435
Hey. Uh, what you doing here?

08:55.437 --> 08:58.077
Well, I was telling
Mandy about the other day

08:58.079 --> 09:00.709
when Jen was on the
show, and she was saying

09:00.711 --> 09:02.690
maybe I was being a
little too sensitive.

09:02.692 --> 09:05.026
Uh, actually, Kyle, now's
not really a great time. I...

09:05.028 --> 09:07.315
- Hey, you left all the equipment out.
- Uh, oh, yeah.

09:07.317 --> 09:09.381
Yeah, just doing a
quick little sound check.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.884
Getting a little pop on my Ps.

09:14.558 --> 09:17.151
Hey, it's Jen.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.143
What?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.730
Am I early? You said 6:30.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.140
No, no, I didn't. No, I didn't.

09:27.142 --> 09:30.477
Well, well, well.

09:30.479 --> 09:33.930
What do we have here?

09:33.932 --> 09:35.816
Kyle, are you feeling better?

09:35.818 --> 09:37.701
Ryan said you were sick.

09:41.352 --> 09:42.875
Oh, I'm sick.

09:42.877 --> 09:44.491
Sick of being lied to.

09:44.493 --> 09:46.084
There's no pop on your Ps.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.259
Okay, would you stop, all right?

09:48.261 --> 09:49.933
I am just doing a little
follow-up with Jen,

09:49.935 --> 09:51.406
and I didn't tell you because I knew

09:51.408 --> 09:52.740
you'd blow it out of proportion.

09:52.742 --> 09:54.593
My life is in tatters.

09:56.171 --> 09:59.035
Uh, if I'm coming between
you guys, I can leave.

09:59.037 --> 10:00.841
No. No, no. You stay, okay?

10:00.843 --> 10:02.768
He's being a baby.
You're the guest today.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.845
And I'm yesterday's news.

10:04.847 --> 10:06.438
Hey, good luck with your little show.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.278
May I suggest a topic?

10:08.280 --> 10:09.530
Betrayal!

10:11.595 --> 10:14.621
Oh, and I'm not mad at
you, Jen. Break a leg.

10:21.697 --> 10:24.531
Yeah, that is hilarious, CeCe.

10:24.533 --> 10:27.292
The cat literally had your tongue.

10:29.112 --> 10:32.005
They had to put him down after!

10:35.437 --> 10:37.176
I...

10:37.178 --> 10:39.460
I don't understand what he sees in her.

10:39.462 --> 10:41.214
You know what they say, love is crazy.

10:41.216 --> 10:43.538
They're both nuts. It's perfect.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.229
All right, well, you know,

10:45.231 --> 10:46.628
it doesn't have to make sense to me.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.555
If Joe's happy, then,
uh, then I'm happy.

10:48.557 --> 10:50.434
I think the phrase you're
actually looking for is,

10:50.436 --> 10:51.507
"Mike, you were right,

10:51.509 --> 10:54.177
I'm in awe of your abilities".

10:54.179 --> 10:56.917
Yeah, yeah. Nice work, Cupid.

10:56.919 --> 11:00.066
You know, the secret to
Cupid is the-the arrow.

11:00.068 --> 11:02.204
Especially the point... I
use a single-point broad-head.

11:02.206 --> 11:03.904
It actually rips right
through the heart.

11:03.906 --> 11:05.688
Brings it home to me.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.833
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

11:07.835 --> 11:10.193
I just came by to grab some leftovers.

11:10.195 --> 11:12.087
Usually you guys aren't
here when I do this,

11:12.089 --> 11:14.364
so I'll take it easy.

11:14.366 --> 11:16.647
Take whatever you want, I've
licked all the food in there.

11:17.702 --> 11:19.011
Well, not all of it.

11:19.013 --> 11:20.870
That's what makes it so much fun.

11:20.872 --> 11:24.090
- Is that Joe and CeCe?
- Mm, yeah, yeah.

11:24.092 --> 11:25.500
They're getting to know one another.

11:25.502 --> 11:26.593
It's a date. I set it up,

11:26.595 --> 11:28.520
because I love love.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.339
Huh, I know you find Joe annoying, Dad,

11:31.341 --> 11:34.434
but I didn't think you
wanted to ruin his life.

11:34.436 --> 11:36.499
Why are you saying that?

11:36.501 --> 11:38.179
Because CeCe's a total man-eater.

11:38.181 --> 11:40.236
She's always telling stories
about breaking guys' hearts

11:40.238 --> 11:41.608
and kicking them to the curb.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.777
- I knew it, but you wouldn't listen to me!
- Hey, hey...

11:43.779 --> 11:45.353
Yeah.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.264
She chews them up and spits them out

11:47.266 --> 11:49.190
like she's Ms. Pac-Man.

11:49.192 --> 11:50.566
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

11:50.568 --> 11:52.210
Just take the tofu.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.712
I'm positive I haven't licked that.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.405
Okay.

11:55.407 --> 11:57.466
I'll be back later to steal dessert.

11:59.369 --> 12:01.762
Look at the upside... we
got rid of that old tofu.

12:07.940 --> 12:09.412
She is gonna

12:09.414 --> 12:11.061
break his sweet, sensitive heart.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.255
Listen, you know what?

12:12.257 --> 12:14.232
I've had a lot of marketing
meetings with that woman.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.092
- She's a lot of talk.
- What do you mean?

12:16.094 --> 12:20.054
I think the lady doth whoop too much.

12:20.056 --> 12:22.223
Look, what-what are we gonna
do? What are we gonna do?

12:22.225 --> 12:23.933
What am I gonna do? Listen,
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

12:23.935 --> 12:26.220
- Okay.
- I'm gonna show you how, how I peel an onion.

12:26.222 --> 12:27.762
- Okay? Watch-watch this.
- All right, all right...

12:27.764 --> 12:28.805
Hey, Cees, could you come in here

12:28.807 --> 12:30.474
- a minute before you go?
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:30.476 --> 12:32.233
When I said what are we gonna do
I meant what are you gonna...

12:32.235 --> 12:34.252
Look, she probably has a knife!

12:34.254 --> 12:37.405
What's up, Bax, huh?

12:37.407 --> 12:39.758
But make it quick,
because Joe and I still got

12:39.760 --> 12:41.760
a whole lot of holler left
in this night, you know?

12:41.762 --> 12:44.004
Whoop whoop!

12:44.006 --> 12:46.122
Listen, listen, there's,
there's some stuff

12:46.124 --> 12:47.181
I should tell you about Joe.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.416
Oh, like what?

12:48.418 --> 12:50.102
I just want you to know

12:50.104 --> 12:51.919
Joe's a player.

12:51.921 --> 12:55.298
Love 'em and leave 'em sort of guy.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.759
Oh, okay, but hang on, because...

12:57.761 --> 13:01.095
you said that Joe was
a homebody and see,

13:01.097 --> 13:02.889
now you're saying that Joe's a player?

13:02.891 --> 13:03.931
Yeah!

13:03.933 --> 13:05.859
Yeah, yeah.

13:05.861 --> 13:08.875
Eats them up, chews them up,
spits them out like Pac-Man.

13:08.877 --> 13:11.439
Ooh. Yeah, yeah...

13:11.441 --> 13:13.941
Right, right, yeah, yeah,
because when I said that he was

13:13.943 --> 13:16.444
a homebody, I mean, that
was before I knew you.

13:16.446 --> 13:19.611
And now that I know
you, you guys are exactly

13:19.613 --> 13:22.208
the same type.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.161
You know, um, actually,

13:26.163 --> 13:28.849
uh, I should make this an early night.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.501
I didn't mean to
offend you or anything...

13:31.503 --> 13:33.292
certainly didn't mean
to scare you, 'cause you,

13:33.294 --> 13:35.388
can't scare you, 'cause
you're a party girl.

13:35.390 --> 13:37.465
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah!

13:37.467 --> 13:40.894
It's just that I've got a really
early meeting in the morning

13:40.896 --> 13:43.545
and my social life is just jam-packed.

13:43.547 --> 13:45.433
I get it, I get it.
Do you smell an onion?

13:45.435 --> 13:46.808
- Do you see an onion?
- Yeah...

13:46.810 --> 13:49.189
Uh, yeah, you know what,
uh, CeCe, before you cancel

13:49.191 --> 13:50.796
your plans, you want to
give us a minute, honey?

13:50.798 --> 13:52.201
- Just, yeah.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get outside

13:52.203 --> 13:53.582
and do some drinking!

13:57.889 --> 13:59.578
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.478
Thank you for agreeing to help me, Kyle.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.145
Yeah, I was surprised to get your text.

14:03.147 --> 14:06.511
I thought you'd still
be recording "Rye Bread"

14:06.513 --> 14:08.421
or whatever he calls that thing.

14:08.423 --> 14:11.108
Oh, no, I didn't stay.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.425
It didn't feel right.

14:12.427 --> 14:15.428
And Ryan was pretty
upset after you left.

14:15.430 --> 14:18.190
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.599
Hey.

14:19.601 --> 14:21.843
Hey, what are you doing here?

14:21.845 --> 14:23.770
Uh, just closing up the pot shop

14:23.772 --> 14:25.772
and I got the note that
the toilet was overflowing.

14:25.774 --> 14:29.367
My toilet is flowing
perfectly, thank you.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
You're free to leave.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.612
Okay.

14:32.614 --> 14:33.780
Wait.

14:33.782 --> 14:35.690
I wrote the note.

14:35.692 --> 14:37.951
I need both your help.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.003
I'm doing a report on the differences

14:40.005 --> 14:43.048
between American zombies and jiangshi.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.907
- Those are Chinese zombies.
- I knew that.

14:44.909 --> 14:47.460
- Did not.
- Did, too.

14:47.462 --> 14:50.705
But I don't know anything
about American zombies,

14:50.707 --> 14:53.266
and you guys know so much.

14:56.045 --> 14:58.176
Please?

14:58.178 --> 15:01.035
Okay, well, when it
comes to zombie movies,

15:01.037 --> 15:03.143
N-O-T-L-D is probably
a good place to start.

15:03.145 --> 15:05.052
What's that?

15:05.054 --> 15:06.340
Uh, that's how annoying people

15:06.342 --> 15:08.740
say Night of the Living Dead.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.356
Which is not the first
zombie movie, Jen.

15:11.358 --> 15:13.363
Uh, didn't say it was
the first zombie movie.

15:13.365 --> 15:14.487
Did I? Did I say that?

15:14.489 --> 15:16.230
"Did I say that?"

15:16.232 --> 15:17.582
Do you listen to yourself?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.066
All the time.

15:19.068 --> 15:21.068
As do 1,104 subscribers.

15:21.070 --> 15:23.738
Oh, sorry, Dr. Laura.

15:23.740 --> 15:27.232
Okay, so, what was
the first zombie movie?

15:27.234 --> 15:29.169
Well, some people would
say Frankenstein.

15:29.171 --> 15:31.171
Uh, not a zombie.

15:31.173 --> 15:34.957
Uh, brought back to life. A zombie.

15:34.959 --> 15:38.753
Uh, did not eat brains. Not a zombie.

15:38.755 --> 15:41.464
Also, Frankenstein wasn't
even the monster's name.

15:41.466 --> 15:44.428
True, technically it was
"Frankenstein's monster".

15:44.430 --> 15:45.726
But nobody wants to say that.

15:45.728 --> 15:48.638
It's like saying "Frankenstein's dog".

15:48.640 --> 15:50.598
Did Frankenstein even have a dog?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.473
I don't know, I mean, he made a guy.

15:52.475 --> 15:54.602
Why wouldn't he make a dog?

15:54.604 --> 15:57.497
Probably 'cause the dog
wouldn't stop licking his bolts.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.535
You know, it's too bad we're...

16:02.537 --> 16:04.278
Uh, never mind.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.464
You were gonna say it's
too bad we're not recording?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.465
Yeah.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.835
This is some primo "Ry-Ry".

16:10.837 --> 16:12.512
Jen left.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.551
You know, she's pretty smart.

16:18.553 --> 16:20.220
Yeah, she is.

16:20.222 --> 16:23.172
Maybe we should have
her back on our podcast.

16:23.174 --> 16:25.967
Our podcast?

16:25.969 --> 16:28.895
Like, Ry-Ry and Ky-Ky,
the Sci-Fi Guy-Guys?

16:28.897 --> 16:31.064
Are you in?

16:31.066 --> 16:34.784
Did Frankenstein's dog have wet bolts?

16:38.019 --> 16:40.838
So, help me out here,
CeCe, because I can't shake

16:40.840 --> 16:42.650
the feeling that there's a completely

16:42.652 --> 16:46.267
different person under
all this... "Whoop whoop!"

16:46.269 --> 16:48.650
What? No. No.

16:48.652 --> 16:51.676
I mean, what you see is
what you get, you know?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.371
I'm just a wild, banging, hipster chick.

16:55.373 --> 16:57.423
- Yeah.
- Right.

16:57.425 --> 17:00.266
So, then, why isn't a meaningless fling

17:00.268 --> 17:02.044
exactly what you're looking for?

17:02.046 --> 17:04.430
Because if Joe's a player and
you're a player, why not play?

17:04.432 --> 17:06.023
Oh, because...

17:06.026 --> 17:07.883
Yeah, because, because you are not

17:07.885 --> 17:10.244
really a wild, banging, hipster chick.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.366
No.

17:16.611 --> 17:18.369
No, I'm not.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.854
Well, then, who are you?

17:19.856 --> 17:21.873
Because-because I would really like

17:21.875 --> 17:23.523
to meet that person.

17:23.526 --> 17:25.734
I'm just a woman

17:25.737 --> 17:26.902
in her mid-30...

17:26.904 --> 17:29.530
Eh!

17:29.532 --> 17:31.866
- Late thir...
- Nope.

17:31.868 --> 17:32.926
Okay.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.556
I am a woman past 30...

17:38.558 --> 17:40.951
Okay.

17:40.953 --> 17:44.121
... who would just like
to find something real.

17:45.501 --> 17:47.616
Well, I mean, if that's what you want,

17:47.618 --> 17:50.268
- then you need to be real.
- Oh, okay.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.219
Well, that's easy for you to say.

17:52.221 --> 17:53.794
You're just so beautiful

17:53.796 --> 17:56.891
and you have this perfect relationship.

17:56.893 --> 17:59.077
Well, one of those things is true.

18:00.897 --> 18:02.271
But...

18:02.273 --> 18:05.254
my relationship didn't
start out that way.

18:05.256 --> 18:07.276
When I first met Mike, he was this

18:07.278 --> 18:09.754
big, stubborn loudmouth.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.999
And then you finally got
him to reveal his true self?

18:13.001 --> 18:15.404
Oh, no, that, that is his true self.

18:15.406 --> 18:18.263
But, look, no, I-I was
the one who was pretending.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.314
I-I was big and loud, too,

18:20.316 --> 18:22.342
because I thought that's what he'd like.

18:22.344 --> 18:23.392
Did it work?

18:23.394 --> 18:25.127
Yeah, yeah, for a while.

18:25.129 --> 18:28.798
I mean, he'd laugh when
I belched the alphabet.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.517
Or did the robot dance
at a football game.

18:33.521 --> 18:35.096
- I hear you.
- Yeah?

18:35.098 --> 18:37.139
I've once did "the
worm" at a bar mitzvah.

18:37.141 --> 18:39.729
- Oh.
- Just ow...

18:39.731 --> 18:43.422
I know, eventually, it's just,
it's so exhausting, right?

18:43.424 --> 18:45.712
- I know!
- Look, I had to show Mike

18:45.714 --> 18:47.942
that I, I'm just a geology nerd

18:47.944 --> 18:49.808
who-who loves curling up on the sofa

18:49.810 --> 18:52.112
and watching old movies.

18:52.114 --> 18:54.563
And I'm just a cat lady

18:54.565 --> 18:57.594
who had to butter herself to
get into these pants tonight!

19:00.974 --> 19:04.911
But what if I show the real me and...

19:04.913 --> 19:06.431
I get rejected?

19:06.433 --> 19:08.790
Oh, honey, look, that is why

19:08.792 --> 19:11.173
God made ice cream and wine.

19:11.175 --> 19:12.558
Yeah.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.627
But you will never really know

19:14.629 --> 19:16.179
if you don't take a risk.

19:16.181 --> 19:17.870
I hate to interrupt.

19:17.872 --> 19:19.657
Who am I kidding, I
love to interrupt, but...

19:19.659 --> 19:22.471
Joe finished all the
potpourri in the bathroom,

19:22.473 --> 19:25.312
and I'm done talking to him.

19:25.314 --> 19:26.889
Hey, I'm feeling
pretty light on my feet.

19:26.891 --> 19:28.023
You want to hit that rave?

19:28.025 --> 19:30.001
You know, um, to be honest,

19:30.003 --> 19:32.672
Joe, I was thinking maybe we could just

19:32.674 --> 19:35.204
go someplace quiet and talk.

19:35.206 --> 19:38.478
I mean, would that be something
that you would like to do?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.735
Yes, when I was in the
bathroom, I googled "rave",

19:40.737 --> 19:43.130
- and-and it scared me to death!
- I know, right?

19:44.092 --> 19:45.517
Thank you, guys, you know,

19:45.519 --> 19:48.520
- Mm-hmm.
- for everything, um...

19:48.522 --> 19:50.838
- So, where you want to go, Joe?
- Well, I know a great

19:50.840 --> 19:52.765
all-night deli that
serves terrific coffee.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.059
And my mother works there,
so we don't have to tip.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.177
Oh!

19:56.179 --> 19:58.541
I'll see you at work, Joe.

19:58.543 --> 20:01.141
Well, well, what do you know?

20:01.143 --> 20:03.391
There was more to CeCe than I thought.

20:03.393 --> 20:05.716
Okay, and there was more to
Joe, but there wasn't that much

20:05.718 --> 20:08.230
to begin with, so it
wasn't a big step up.

20:08.232 --> 20:09.729
You know, who knows?

20:09.731 --> 20:11.543
Maybe it'll work out with them.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.733
- Hmm.
- Hmm, so I'm pretty good at this Cupid thing.

20:13.735 --> 20:15.121
- The big question I have about Cupid is
- Yeah?

20:15.123 --> 20:17.198
where-where does Cupid find love?

20:22.130 --> 20:24.556
Get upstairs, human,

20:24.558 --> 20:27.809
and get ready for l'amour.

20:29.452 --> 20:31.308
You know, I got, I got to admit,

20:31.310 --> 20:34.315
that still does it for me.

20:40.765 --> 20:44.047
Hey, Mike Baxter and a couple of
my friends here for Outdoor Man

20:44.049 --> 20:46.572
with a few words about duck hunting.

20:47.730 --> 20:48.988
No offense, guys.

20:48.990 --> 20:51.106
Now, you can pre-heat you oven to 350,

20:51.108 --> 20:52.991
leave it open, cross your fingers

20:52.993 --> 20:54.919
and hope a honker flies in.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.441
Or you can increase your
chances by letting Outdoor Man

20:58.443 --> 21:00.908
outfit you with a duck decoy spread

21:00.910 --> 21:03.110
and the irresistible
music of a duck call.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.858
It might not sound like
much to us, but to a duck,

21:07.860 --> 21:11.344
it sounds like Marvin
Gaye's "Let's Get It On".

21:11.346 --> 21:14.630
When a duck goes for a
decoy, it ends up braised,

21:14.632 --> 21:17.960
but when a human falls for
a decoy, he gets eaten alive.

21:17.962 --> 21:20.462
My good friend Billy Shakespeare wrote,

21:20.464 --> 21:22.471
"To thine own self be true".

21:22.473 --> 21:26.117
But when it came to ducks, he
was fine with tricking them.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.961
You know what would make you even cuter?

21:29.963 --> 21:31.059
Listen to me.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.067
A nice cinnamon glaze, wow.

21:35.069 --> 21:37.337
Baxter out.
