13:19.640 --> 13:22.074
I thought I'd come by
the old HQ and say hi.

13:22.076 --> 13:24.101
Bad timing, man.

13:24.945 --> 13:27.346
Wallet, keys and cell phone on the table.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.898
Now.

13:30.249 --> 13:33.018
Good. Now sit down

13:33.020 --> 13:35.029
and shut up.

13:35.490 --> 13:37.740
Take care of the keys and wallets.

13:41.194 --> 13:43.829
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

13:44.538 --> 13:46.765
- Are you out yet?
- <i>Not exactly.</i>

13:46.767 --> 13:48.767
What? Stop clowning around
and get outta there!

13:48.769 --> 13:51.437
I'd love to. Just one small problem.

13:51.439 --> 13:54.473
- Shade's now a hostage.
- What!?

13:54.475 --> 13:56.475
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:56.477 --> 13:58.677
That's quite the situation
you walked into.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.783
Any idea what this is all about?

14:05.434 --> 14:06.719
Nobody tells me anything.

14:08.822 --> 14:11.207
You ever been to that
lab on the twelfth floor?

14:11.232 --> 14:12.725
No, that's R&D.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.627
You have any idea what
they keep in there?

14:14.652 --> 14:16.160
That's above my pay grade.

14:16.904 --> 14:19.565
Say... have we met before?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.700
You spend much time in Sudbury?

14:21.702 --> 14:23.969
No. With all my cats,

14:23.971 --> 14:27.673
- I don't get a chance to travel much.
- Hey, you two, shut up!

14:33.285 --> 14:35.319
So, uh, what happened there?

14:36.817 --> 14:38.517
Copy room incident.

14:38.519 --> 14:41.019
My necktie got caught
in the paper shredder.

14:41.021 --> 14:43.622
- Really?
- Oh, it was harrowing.

14:43.624 --> 14:46.725
Whirring blades coming
closer and closer...

14:46.727 --> 14:48.394
My life flashed before my eyes.

14:50.479 --> 14:51.997
Kinda like now.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.143
Look, I know things
look dire at the moment,

14:57.144 --> 14:59.211
but I have every confidence

14:59.213 --> 15:01.213
that things will get
better before too long.

15:02.116 --> 15:05.150
Look, buddy. I'm the head
of Customer Relations.

15:05.152 --> 15:06.375
So?

15:06.400 --> 15:08.220
It was my team that
fielded all those calls

15:08.222 --> 15:10.889
from the customers whose
GreatLife Sonic Wave Plungers

15:10.891 --> 15:13.330
exploded their toilets.
You know what I'm saying?

15:13.332 --> 15:15.060
No, I really don't.

15:16.213 --> 15:18.230
I know a pile of crap when I hear it.

15:22.802 --> 15:25.514
Hey. I updated Maz on your situation.

15:28.153 --> 15:30.154
(SNEEZING)

15:46.092 --> 15:48.930
- Yeah, I can guess his reaction.
- Why did you come back up?

15:48.932 --> 15:51.930
- I thought you were in trouble.
- And which one of us is a hostage now?

15:51.932 --> 15:54.333
Can we discuss this later?

15:54.335 --> 15:56.068
Don't do anything stupid.

15:56.070 --> 15:58.506
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

16:02.108 --> 16:04.109
(PHONE RINGING)

16:04.111 --> 16:06.111
What's going on? Are you guys OK?

16:06.113 --> 16:09.214
I'm fine. But Shade's now a hostage too.

16:09.216 --> 16:11.550
- What!?
- <i>Yeah, listen, it's a long story.</i>

16:11.552 --> 16:13.885
The gunmen are looking for
something in the lab here.

16:13.887 --> 16:17.522
Can you dig into GreatLife,
see what's worth taking hostages for?

16:17.524 --> 16:20.125
OK. Hey, boss...

16:20.127 --> 16:22.599
- Yeah.
- Shade's gonna be alright, isn't he?

16:23.130 --> 16:24.429
Of course. Yeah, sure.

16:24.431 --> 16:26.965
You know, for a P.I.,
you're a lousy liar.

16:27.535 --> 16:29.134
Get to work.

16:30.652 --> 16:34.373
- So Matt Shade is now a hostage too?
- Unforeseen complication.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.375
I think it was a foreseen complication.

16:36.377 --> 16:39.945
- I told you to get them out of there.
- In the good news department,

16:39.947 --> 16:42.581
Shade's partner, Angie, is still
running around the building.

16:43.217 --> 16:44.816
Which...

16:45.219 --> 16:47.152
could also be bad news.

16:47.154 --> 16:49.421
There's nothing we can do about it now.

16:49.423 --> 16:51.890
We need to figure out
what these people want

16:51.892 --> 16:53.992
before it blows up in all our faces.

17:00.967 --> 17:03.602
(HEAVY BREATHING)

17:03.604 --> 17:06.238
Hey man,

17:06.240 --> 17:09.174
- you OK?
- Not good with stress.

17:09.175 --> 17:13.011
Who is? Don't worry, we're
gonna get out of this, OK?

17:14.914 --> 17:17.848
Do you have any idea
what these guys are after?

17:19.952 --> 17:22.154
Maybe R&D or something.

17:22.589 --> 17:24.356
What would they be after in there?

17:24.358 --> 17:27.854
I don't know. I'm not up on all
the secret development projects.

17:27.878 --> 17:29.494
Charmaine could tell you more.

17:29.496 --> 17:32.798
She's head of Marketing and Promotions.

17:33.409 --> 17:34.800
Oh no...

17:34.802 --> 17:39.137
(HEAVY BREATHING)

17:40.054 --> 17:41.549
The irony is,

17:41.574 --> 17:42.876
I'm chief accountant.

17:42.901 --> 17:44.676
You'd think I'd be used to
high-pressure situations.

17:44.678 --> 17:47.779
Don't be so hard on yourself.
This is an extreme situation.

17:47.781 --> 17:50.649
True. Compared to this fiasco,
the nationwide roll-out

17:50.651 --> 17:54.319
of our automatic hotdog maker,
the Frankenformer, was a cake walk.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.394
<i>Hey, Shade.</i>

18:15.419 --> 18:17.576
I just heard from Maz.
The building's surrounded.

18:17.578 --> 18:20.312
- What are the cops gonna do?
- I don't know.

18:20.314 --> 18:22.743
If they storm the building,
these guys might freak out

18:22.768 --> 18:24.216
and start killing hostages.

18:24.218 --> 18:28.553
- We can't let that happen.
- I guess it's time to go to Plan B.

18:28.555 --> 18:31.356
- We have a Plan B?
- One of the gunmen

18:31.358 --> 18:33.358
just downed his third bottle of water.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.094
I'm betting a bathroom break's
in his near future.

18:36.096 --> 18:38.296
Understood. I'll see what I can do.

18:38.298 --> 18:41.266
Just wish I had some kind of weapon.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.855
- Good luck.
- SWAT has secured the neighborhood.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.411
We have a four-block perimeter.

18:52.413 --> 18:55.514
Alright. I'm also placing snipers
in the building on the corner.

18:55.516 --> 18:57.784
They'll have a clear shot
at the fourteenth floor.

18:57.809 --> 19:02.254
Whoa, snipers? That sounds like a...
really good idea.

19:24.922 --> 19:26.342
Charmaine?

19:26.367 --> 19:28.246
My horoscope told me
not to go out tonight.

19:28.248 --> 19:29.967
It's gonna be OK.

19:31.026 --> 19:33.652
I didn't know that we had
an office in Sudbury.

19:35.574 --> 19:38.851
I hear these guys may be
after something in the R&D lab?

19:42.563 --> 19:44.162
It's the Robo-Slow.

19:45.482 --> 19:47.232
What's the Robo-Slow?

19:47.234 --> 19:49.701
It's a secret project.

19:49.703 --> 19:52.103
It's a voice-activated slow cooker.

19:52.105 --> 19:54.940
You tell it what you want
for dinner, it cooks it.

19:54.942 --> 19:57.409
- You're kidding.
- If the prototype

19:57.411 --> 20:00.245
passes testing, we're
projecting worldwide sales

20:00.247 --> 20:02.681
upwards of 50 million dollars.

20:04.586 --> 20:06.384
Not that it matters anymore,

20:06.386 --> 20:09.120
because we're not
getting out of here alive.

20:25.171 --> 20:27.772
Alright, time to go shopping.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.717
Oh, man... I need air.

20:38.719 --> 20:40.719
- Sit down.
- I can't breathe.

20:40.721 --> 20:42.700
I can make that permanent.

20:42.725 --> 20:44.356
I gotta get out of here, I can't breathe!

20:44.358 --> 20:47.753
- Take it easy, man.
- I gotta get out! I need air!

20:53.092 --> 20:54.566
Alright,

20:54.568 --> 20:58.389
next person who tries anything
gets a bullet to the head.

21:23.217 --> 21:25.432
- Angie, come in.
- Yeah.

21:25.457 --> 21:26.786
One of the hostages,

21:26.788 --> 21:28.889
a guy named Mark, tried to make
a run for it. He got tazed.

21:28.891 --> 21:31.258
Yeah, I just saw him. I think
they're taking him downstairs.

21:33.628 --> 21:35.695
Fearless leader's getting antsy.

21:35.697 --> 21:37.697
I don't think he's gonna
make it till midnight.

21:37.699 --> 21:39.906
Maz just told me SWAT's
locked down the neighbourhood.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.067
<i>OK.</i>

21:41.069 --> 21:44.977
I need to talk to the CEO,
Patricia. I'll check in later.

21:59.159 --> 22:00.786
I don't know who you are,

22:00.811 --> 22:03.170
but I don't have any
sales reps in Sudbury.

22:03.242 --> 22:05.892
My name is Matt Shade.
I'm a private investigator.

22:05.894 --> 22:08.628
My partner's in the building
too. We're here to help.

22:08.630 --> 22:11.631
- How do I know I can trust you?
- You don't.

22:11.633 --> 22:15.068
But we've notified the police.
SWAT team is outside.

22:19.011 --> 22:20.440
Gotta take a leak.

22:30.685 --> 22:32.282
How do you know about the Robo-Slow?

22:32.307 --> 22:33.687
That's a top secret project.

22:33.689 --> 22:37.090
- Charmaine told me.
- Of course she did.

22:37.092 --> 22:39.159
We've tried to keep it under wraps,

22:39.161 --> 22:41.461
but in a company this size,
there are bound to be leaks.

22:41.463 --> 22:44.965
- Is it patented?
- No, not yet.

22:44.967 --> 22:48.335
So if someone were to steal it
and beat you to market...

22:48.337 --> 22:50.884
Not so easy. They'd have
to have manufacturing plants

22:50.886 --> 22:53.401
and distribution channels
already in place.

22:53.426 --> 22:54.841
Right.

22:56.673 --> 22:58.178
Anyone come to mind?

22:59.092 --> 23:01.348
Our main competitor.

23:01.350 --> 23:03.350
A housewares company called Best Times.

23:03.352 --> 23:06.052
But I can't believe they'd do
something like this.

23:06.054 --> 23:07.820
You'd be surprised.

I just took down one of the gunmen.
His name's Thomas Redfield.

24:17.526 --> 24:18.987
Who are you talking to?

24:19.012 --> 24:20.694
Angie took out one of the hostage takers.

24:20.696 --> 24:22.509
Alright, well, put her on speaker.

of his driver's license right now.</i>

We think they're after
a new GreatLife prototype.

Alright, we'll look into it,

24:30.058 --> 24:31.938
but in the meantime,
I need you to stand down.

24:31.940 --> 24:35.694
- But I can help.
- I'm ordering you to find a safe room,

24:35.696 --> 24:39.379
secure yourself until help arrives.
We will be in touch if we need you.

- do not engage with Everett again.
- Yes, ma'am. I mean no, ma'am.

24:53.295 --> 24:55.595
I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

24:55.597 --> 24:58.631
Just listen, then. Can you look
into the Robo-Slow angle, please?

24:58.633 --> 25:00.375
Somebody's financing this operation.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.402
Maybe GreatLife's
competition is playing dirty.

25:02.404 --> 25:04.504
We are not having this
conversation, you got it?

25:04.506 --> 25:06.797
Fine. I also didn't ask you to copy Zoe

on the police report on Redfield.

25:07.976 --> 25:09.573
Oy vey.

Empty?

25:31.632 --> 25:33.568
Well, now it's a party.

25:36.583 --> 25:37.626
Psst!

25:47.148 --> 25:49.916
I saw you talking to Charmaine earlier.

25:50.639 --> 25:52.352
Did she mention me?

25:52.724 --> 25:55.288
No. Why?

25:55.290 --> 25:56.937
No reason.

25:58.522 --> 26:01.461
- Are you sure we haven't met before?
- No.

26:01.463 --> 26:04.297
- Last year's conference in Petawawa?
- Uh-uh.

26:05.073 --> 26:07.901
- Team building laser tag?
- Mm-mm.

26:07.903 --> 26:11.576
- Corporate karaoke retreat?
- I think I would remember that.

26:16.081 --> 26:18.311
Hey, how's the pain?

26:19.164 --> 26:22.136
Well, seeing as how we may not
make it out of here alive...

26:22.754 --> 26:24.150
It's nothing. I'm fine.

26:24.589 --> 26:26.186
So you're faking it?

26:26.591 --> 26:29.055
I've been promising Mom
a cruise for years.

26:29.057 --> 26:32.725
I finally save the money and Mr.
Bickles needs emergency surgery.

26:33.707 --> 26:34.994
Mr. Bickles?

26:34.996 --> 26:38.865
My oldest cat. Urinary obstruction.

26:38.867 --> 26:41.167
So you needed some quick cash.

26:41.169 --> 26:44.871
Mom gets her cruise,
Mr. Bickles gets to pee.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.841
It's what I call a win-win, my friend.

26:49.197 --> 26:51.158
<i>Shade, I've got Zoe on the line.</i>

26:51.680 --> 26:55.014
Maz called. The search on
Thomas Redfield came back clean.

26:55.016 --> 26:58.618
<i>- No priors, not even a parking ticket.
- There's something else.</i>

26:58.620 --> 27:00.186
He didn't have any bullets in his gun.

27:00.211 --> 27:02.456
What do you think the chances
are the other guys don't either?

27:02.481 --> 27:03.723
Don't even think about it.

27:03.725 --> 27:06.893
Why would a guy like Redfield be
involved in something like this?

27:06.895 --> 27:09.762
I don't know. Maz said he
works for a recycling company.

27:09.764 --> 27:12.432
I called the dispatcher
and they said he's on shift.

27:12.434 --> 27:15.635
- Recycling? Do you mean Apex Recycling?
- Yeah, how'd you know?

27:15.637 --> 27:18.137
Because earlier, I saw one of their
dumpsters parked in the loading bay.

27:19.811 --> 27:21.708
How many are on his crew tonight?

27:21.710 --> 27:24.077
Um... him plus two.

27:24.079 --> 27:26.613
- That's three guys.
- And three gunmen.

27:26.615 --> 27:29.048
- What're you thinking?
- Why would you need three gunmen

27:29.050 --> 27:31.417
to steal a souped-up slow cooker?

27:31.419 --> 27:34.754
Something's hinky.
I gotta talk to Patricia again.

27:34.756 --> 27:38.205
OK. I'm gonna find the hostage
they tazed, see if he's OK.

27:45.253 --> 27:47.834
- Ma'am? You should see this.
- What is it?

27:47.836 --> 27:50.003
I ran a check on the members
of the recycling crew

27:50.005 --> 27:52.105
like you asked. Two of them,
Thomas Redfield

27:52.107 --> 27:54.140
and Steven MacGruder, came back clean.

27:54.142 --> 27:56.843
- OK. And the third one?
- Yeah, not so much.

27:57.307 --> 27:59.781
Darryl Fenwick. Convicted
of multiple instances

27:59.783 --> 28:02.579
of violent assault,
including unlawful possession

28:02.604 --> 28:04.497
of a firearm and armed robbery.

28:04.522 --> 28:06.653
Well, I guess we know
who's in charge up there.

28:06.655 --> 28:08.788
Where's Detective Mazhari?

28:09.444 --> 28:11.291
I don't know.

28:11.905 --> 28:13.726
Um, well,

28:13.728 --> 28:16.029
I think I saw him on his phone earlier.

28:16.031 --> 28:19.198
- Oh, his mother again?
- Maybe.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.834
Um... I hear she gets lonely.

28:21.836 --> 28:25.572
OK, you know what? We need to
establish a line of communication here,

28:25.574 --> 28:27.027
find out what these
guys are really after.

28:27.052 --> 28:29.142
OK, HQ says that the hostage
negotiator is on his way,

28:29.167 --> 28:30.276
so it'll be about 15 minutes

28:30.278 --> 28:32.342
Right, well, we can't wait that long.

28:33.481 --> 28:36.916
Relax, Powers. I did hostage
negotiation for ten years

28:36.918 --> 28:38.316
before coming here.

28:38.318 --> 28:41.768
Quiet back there! Roll record, please.

Where are you?

29:11.686 --> 29:13.853
Outside the building, sir.
And we are ready

29:13.855 --> 29:16.589
to get you anything you need to
bring this to a safe conclusion.

29:16.591 --> 29:19.626
No, no, no. You stay the hell away, OK?

29:19.628 --> 29:24.327
'Cause I see any cops,
or this phone rings again,

29:24.329 --> 29:26.566
I'm gonna start killing hostages.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.692
He hung up.

29:33.904 --> 29:35.174
These guys are serious.

29:35.176 --> 29:36.781
Prep the SWAT team.

29:37.657 --> 29:40.179
The cops? What the hell?

29:40.181 --> 29:43.449
Hey, Tommy's not back from the john.

29:44.414 --> 29:45.665
OK.

29:48.822 --> 29:52.225
You keep an eye on these morons.
I'll be back.

29:55.175 --> 29:57.897
Looks like the cops just
called. Leader's on the move.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.891
I still haven't located
the other hostage. Oh!

30:03.638 --> 30:05.035
What do you mean, the cops are outside?

30:05.060 --> 30:06.946
I don't know! I got a call
from the negotiator.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.408
Oh my god. Where's Tommy?

30:08.410 --> 30:10.725
I can't find him. You're on your own.

30:10.727 --> 30:13.179
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you!

30:13.181 --> 30:15.623
This is not my fault, alright?
This was your idea.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.740
It was such a simple plan.
How the hell could you mess it up?

30:29.981 --> 30:31.997

Yeah, I'm sure it's the guy I saw earlier

30:33.728 --> 30:36.000
in the elevator, except this
time he looks less like a hostage

30:36.002 --> 30:39.637

30:39.639 --> 30:41.080

- But what's he after?
- <i>Not the prototype.</i>

30:43.495 --> 30:45.116
I found them in the basement. Plus,

30:45.141 --> 30:47.130
he would know about the
lock on the R&D lab.

30:47.132 --> 30:49.699
The hostages, the R&D lab distraction...

30:49.701 --> 30:51.968
maybe he's playing us for time.

30:51.970 --> 30:55.795
- To do what?
- How did the cops know we're here?

30:55.797 --> 30:58.407
- On this floor? In this office?
- I don't know.

31:00.077 --> 31:01.894
Alright.

31:01.896 --> 31:03.968
Someone in here has been
talking to the cops.

31:03.993 --> 31:05.448
It's not me.

31:05.450 --> 31:08.951
I can personally vouch for
this gentle flower of a woman.

We're sticking to the plan.
And until I find out who the traitor is,

you're all skating on thin ice.

31:21.032 --> 31:22.595
Skating.

Uh, Wallace here was
gonna make a run for it,

31:34.112 --> 31:36.512
and after what happened to Mark,
I didn't want to let that happen.

31:36.514 --> 31:38.714

Alright, Angie, I just talked to
the CEO of GreatLife's competition.

31:54.599 --> 31:57.133
They're already manufacturing
their own A.I. microwave

31:57.135 --> 32:00.136
and they have zero interest
in the Robo-Slow, so...

32:00.138 --> 32:02.471
That's as far as I got with...

32:02.473 --> 32:05.241
- that.
- Is that Angie?

32:05.243 --> 32:06.406
Maybe.

32:06.431 --> 32:08.818
We think the leader's name is
Darryl Fenwick. He's got priors,

32:08.820 --> 32:11.814
including armed robbery. And
that guy you took out, Redfield?

32:11.816 --> 32:13.983
You'll never guess who his cousin is.

32:13.985 --> 32:16.586
One of the hostages.
He works for GreatLife.

32:16.588 --> 32:18.821
Oh. You already knew that.

32:18.823 --> 32:21.057
I just found out. His name's Mark
Bates, he's head of accounting.

32:21.059 --> 32:23.125
Wait a second.
If this isn't about a slow cooker,

32:23.150 --> 32:24.327
then what are they after?

32:24.329 --> 32:25.809
I don't know,
but I think it has something to do

32:25.834 --> 32:27.064
with that recycling bin.

32:27.066 --> 32:29.423
I'm going to go stake out
the loading dock.

32:29.425 --> 32:32.835
OK, but Inspector Carson is sending
SWAT in through the parking garage.

32:32.837 --> 32:35.605
I don't like the sound
of that. Can't you stall them?

32:38.876 --> 32:41.508
- So you're the Shadow!
- Shh!

32:42.550 --> 32:44.094
I'm also a P.I.

32:44.601 --> 32:45.892

- Smart watches?
- They're gifts for the staff.

He must've found out.

in, it would set off the alarm.

- A little over $1,000.

Alright, let's go. Move it, both of you.

- Who was that?
- Must be his partner.

- You are?

Go, go, go.

Look, you know the police are outside.

37:41.799 --> 37:43.509
Why don't you guys just
give yourselves up?

37:43.534 --> 37:46.133
- That way nobody gets hurt.
- OK, yeah.

- Who's she?
- His partner. They're P.I.s.

Oh my God...

38:00.931 --> 38:03.432
This is turning into one
of those days, isn't it, Mark?

38:03.487 --> 38:06.290
I'm sure at some point
this seemed like a genius idea.

38:06.292 --> 38:09.359
After a few beers, you and your
cousin convince his co-workers

38:09.361 --> 38:11.962
to stage a fake hostage scenario.

38:11.964 --> 38:15.132
Which gives your guys time to
transfer the watches to the dumpster.

38:15.134 --> 38:17.167
A few hours later,
you free the hostages...

38:17.169 --> 38:19.403
assuming you have
an emergency escape plan.

38:19.405 --> 38:22.873
Then later, the recycling truck
comes by and picks up its usual load.

38:22.875 --> 38:25.275
Poor Mark, the victim of crazed gunmen,

38:25.277 --> 38:27.344

And now the cops... we're surrounded!
I knew bringing guns into this

- was a big mistake.
- Mine's the only one with bullets.

You think I'd give your idiot
cousin and his buddy loaded guns?

of a couple of loose ends.

never supposed to come to this.

We've come too far to back down.

38:52.938 --> 38:56.373
I'm running the show now.
You get that dumpster loaded.

38:57.049 --> 38:59.543
I'm gonna take care of everything else.

38:59.844 --> 39:01.053
Walk.

39:02.346 --> 39:03.890
Get going.

39:14.125 --> 39:17.294
You seem pretty calm for
someone surrounded by police.

39:17.296 --> 39:20.897
There's an old subway tunnel
underneath this building.

39:20.899 --> 39:23.324
We broke the maintenance access.

39:23.326 --> 39:26.867
So as soon as those watches are loaded,

39:26.869 --> 39:29.573
- we're history.
- What about the dumpster?

39:29.575 --> 39:31.761
You're the only ones who know about it.

39:31.763 --> 39:34.745
Actually, that's not true.
What about your buddy Tommy?

39:34.747 --> 39:37.347
He might spill the beans on your
whole plan to protect himself.

39:55.858 --> 39:57.601
OK. Fine.

39:58.319 --> 39:59.636
I'll take you to him.

39:59.638 --> 40:02.472
Good, good. That wasn't
that hard, now, was it?

40:02.474 --> 40:05.308
Let's go. Keep walking. Go.

40:26.464 --> 40:28.999
- You first.
- What's the matter, you don't trust me?

40:29.001 --> 40:30.977
- (CHUCKLING)
- No.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.207
Uh...

40:37.608 --> 40:39.209
I can't find the light switch.

40:39.211 --> 40:41.487
- (SIGHING)
- Wow.

40:47.151 --> 40:49.019
(CRACKLING)

40:52.877 --> 40:55.084
I've been wanting to do that all night.

40:56.861 --> 40:58.895
What the hell did you rig up
over there, Everett?

40:58.897 --> 41:01.665
Well, you remember my toaster-
slash-hair-dryer disaster?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.967
Got me wondering what would
happen if I daisy-chained up

41:03.969 --> 41:06.134
twenty of those GreatLife's
Lightning Prep Veggie-Dicers.

41:06.136 --> 41:09.849
- Hm! Very impressive.
- Yippee-ki-yay.

41:14.011 --> 41:15.563
Drop the weapon!

41:17.440 --> 41:18.915
I got some bad news.

41:18.917 --> 41:20.984
A friend of mine told me
your clip's empty,

41:20.986 --> 41:24.721
- and that gun's got bullets.
- OK. OK.

41:26.030 --> 41:28.159
Gun on the ground. Get on your knees.

41:29.312 --> 41:33.247
Hands behind your back.
Let's go. How you doing?

41:35.599 --> 41:40.002
♪ There's an island
in my mind, she said ♪

41:40.004 --> 41:43.572
♪ We could go, we could go,
we could get it there ♪

41:43.574 --> 41:47.810
♪ There's a city in the wild instead ♪

41:47.812 --> 41:49.845
♪ We can make, we can make,
we can make it, yeah ♪

41:49.847 --> 41:52.014
- You two...
- These two, huh?

41:52.016 --> 41:54.249
You are just lucky that
no one was seriously hurt.

41:54.251 --> 41:56.367
It wasn't luck, Ma'am.

41:56.369 --> 41:59.188
It was thanks to critical information
Detective Mazhari

41:59.190 --> 42:01.806
was able to glean from our sources
on the inside.

42:01.808 --> 42:05.194
That's true. Once I told Maz
the last gunman had no bullets...

42:05.196 --> 42:07.971
He was able to successfully
defuse the situation.

42:07.973 --> 42:10.933
Right. Well, I know spin when I hear it.

42:10.935 --> 42:13.636
Your full report on my desk
before sunrise.

42:13.638 --> 42:15.022
Yours, too.

42:15.047 --> 42:16.235
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Yes, Ma'am.

42:21.796 --> 42:24.475
So, the whole neck brace thing?

42:24.477 --> 42:27.928
Yeah, that was a scam. But this isn't.

42:27.953 --> 42:29.953
Bruised ribs on company property.

42:29.955 --> 42:32.255
- (LAUGHING)
- Yeah, sorry about that.

42:32.257 --> 42:35.491
Now I can say I went
toe-to-toe with Matt Shade.

42:35.493 --> 42:36.659
Oof!

42:37.144 --> 42:38.761
Besides,

42:38.763 --> 42:40.690
I think the bandage looks sexy.

42:41.299 --> 42:42.410
Really?

42:42.435 --> 42:45.301
(LAUGHING)

42:47.154 --> 42:48.638
Do you like cats?

42:48.640 --> 42:50.974
They seem like a happy couple.

42:50.976 --> 42:54.177
- You know who's not gonna be happy?
- The insurance company,

42:54.179 --> 42:56.679
when they have to pay out that new claim.

42:58.529 --> 43:00.530
But we did good tonight, Everett.

43:00.555 --> 43:02.689
I think we deserve a reward.

43:03.129 --> 43:04.887
You thinking what I think
you're thinking?

43:04.889 --> 43:08.134
I'm thinking about a double
bacon meat bomb with fries.

43:08.592 --> 43:09.971
Get out of my head!

43:10.005 --> 43:12.005
You know, I'm now even kicking for a

43:12.030 --> 43:13.829
peanut butter banana milk shake.

43:13.856 --> 43:16.283
That's partner ever.
