02:36.073 --> 02:37.407
Scott, you're amazing!

02:37.491 --> 02:39.201
Came out just to see you!

02:40.452 --> 02:41.995
The best day of my life!

02:45.374 --> 02:49.211
It's exactly like the one in Relics.
I made it for you.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.799
It's a magic wand.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.678
Thanks.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.307
I don't want an autograph. I just want
you to know you changed my life.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.353
You did it. You!

03:06.436 --> 03:08.856
Okay, thanks, we can go inside now.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.619
Mr. Landon,
you really don't sound good at all.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.497
No, I'm-- I'm fine. Really.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.499
Okay.

03:28.542 --> 03:33.046
You know the last time a writer had
a star on his dressing room door, it's...

03:33.130 --> 03:36.466
Yep. Living the dream.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.765
The staff from the bookstore
who's sponsoring the event

03:43.849 --> 03:46.059
would really love to come up
and say hello, if that's okay.

03:46.143 --> 03:49.521
Yeah, that's fine. Just give me a few
minutes to get myself together, okay?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.607
Absolutely.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.463
Oh, boy.

05:21.905 --> 05:22.906
Fuck.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.091
Mr. Landon?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.558
I hate to rush you,
but they're ready for you.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.313
Mr. Landon, can you hear me?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.360
Mr. Landon?

06:42.819 --> 06:43.904
Are you okay?

06:47.991 --> 06:49.785
Mr. Landon, can you hear me?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.581
Are you okay?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.293
Mr. Landon!

07:01.547 --> 07:02.840
Mr. Landon!

07:10.806 --> 07:11.807
Mr. Landon.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.769
Mr. Landon, open the door.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.105
Are you okay?

07:29.157 --> 07:30.242
Mr. Landon?

07:31.577 --> 07:33.203
-Mr. Landon!
-Hey.

07:34.872 --> 07:38.041
The bathroom door locked behind me.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.128
Could you get security to open it
and grab my phone?

07:42.754 --> 07:43.755
Sure.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.632
I'm ready.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.719
Let's do it.

07:53.849 --> 07:58.437
Tonight, we have with us
a writer who truly needs no introduction.

07:58.520 --> 08:03.525
After many years and ten best-selling
books, he has become a literary icon.

08:03.609 --> 08:08.947
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a big welcome to Scott Landon.

08:49.488 --> 08:52.741
Good to be here
and great to be alive or what?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.453
The sign says
no swimming in the pool!

08:56.912 --> 08:58.747
And what do we say to that, campers?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.916
Dive right in!

09:00.999 --> 09:02.084
Who put that sign up?

09:02.167 --> 09:04.127
The fun police!

09:07.506 --> 09:10.467
Before I read to you from my new book...

09:13.387 --> 09:19.351
I thought I'd talk a little about
how a novel comes into being.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.652
Sorry.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.243
Take your time, Scott.

09:36.994 --> 09:37.995
What's happening?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.162
Every...

09:40.664 --> 09:41.665
novel...

09:42.624 --> 09:48.088
is a-- a struggle
between the writer and the...

09:53.969 --> 09:57.514
A struggle between the writer
and the story.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.475
And the writer, well, at least this one...

10:03.353 --> 10:05.772
always tries...

10:07.191 --> 10:12.196
to hold on to keep control.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.242
The story...

10:21.830 --> 10:23.165
Fuck.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.339
-Oh. Oh, God.
-You all right?

10:38.639 --> 10:39.640
Take a break, man.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.935
-Is that blood on his hand?
-What's going on?

10:58.367 --> 10:59.576
Can somebody...

11:00.410 --> 11:02.871
call my w-wife--

11:31.608 --> 11:33.610
Is there a doctor in the house?

11:56.258 --> 11:58.802
Hey, babe. What time is it?

11:58.886 --> 12:00.637
This isn't your husband, Mrs. Landon.

12:00.721 --> 12:04.016
It's Dr. Jantzen
at Hudson Hill Memorial Hospital.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.684
Your husband was admitted tonight.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.228
What? What-- What happened?

12:08.312 --> 12:12.858
He was at The Colonnade Theater, scheduled
to give a reading and he collapsed.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.028
Wait a minute.
Wait. Is-- Is-- Is he all right?

12:16.111 --> 12:19.448
Mrs. Landon, I think you should get here
as soon as you possibly can.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.207
Thank you.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.544
-Mrs. Landon, I'm so sorry about--
-Where is he?

12:33.128 --> 12:35.964
I believe a Dr. Jantzen
is waiting for you inside.

12:38.342 --> 12:41.011
He was coughing in the car
and it was not light.

12:42.054 --> 12:44.306
And then I came to see him
in his dressing room--

12:44.389 --> 12:45.599
-Okay, thank you.
-Mrs. Landon.

12:45.682 --> 12:46.683
-Yeah.
-Come with me, please.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.894
Thank you so much. Thank you.

12:50.312 --> 12:54.066
Dr. Morris, dial 112, please. Dr. Morris.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.692
-Dr. Jantzen.
-Hello, Mrs. Landon.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.945
You got here much faster
than I expected. That's good.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.613
-Where is he?
-One floor up.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.033
None of us here
have ever seen old wounds reopen.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.660
His lungs, the water...

13:04.743 --> 13:06.495
The root cause is almost certainly viral,

13:06.578 --> 13:08.747
but as of now we have no idea
what virus that might be,

13:08.830 --> 13:12.209
but only that it's taken hold
with incredible speed.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.879
He requested to be
taken off the ventilator.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.130
What? Why?

13:17.214 --> 13:18.715
He wants to talk to you.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.967
How bad is it?

13:20.050 --> 13:23.637
He's running a fever of 106 degrees,
and he's in organ failure.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.097
I'm sorry, Mrs. Landon.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.099
He's holding on for you.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.300
Hey.

14:07.848 --> 14:08.932
Hey.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.854
-Lisey?
-Yeah.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.904
I'm so hot.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.198
It's so hot.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.035
Is there ice?

14:29.119 --> 14:32.331
Can we have some ice?
Can we have some ice, please?

14:32.414 --> 14:33.624
Yes, of course.

14:39.421 --> 14:41.673
Okay. All right, let's go.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.885
Let's go to the pool.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.305
Just crawl there if you have to.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.016
Long boy.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.728
What about the long boy?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.285
Blocking the path.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.844
Higher than the trees.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.043
No way around.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.765
No, no, no. No. What happened?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.393
What-- What happened?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.522
Something from...

16:22.858 --> 16:24.776
a long time ago.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.448
From when I was a kid.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.121
Something from Paul.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.832
From-- From Paul?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.673
Oh, Daddy!

16:46.757 --> 16:48.091
Daddy, help!

16:48.675 --> 16:50.344
Paul's got the bad!

16:51.136 --> 16:53.764
Daddy! Daddy, help!

16:53.847 --> 16:56.600
Paul's got the bad! Daddy!

17:02.397 --> 17:03.690
You're infected.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.194
He cut me.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.825
Ever since...

17:18.079 --> 17:19.790
all these years...

17:23.836 --> 17:25.712
something has been...

17:26.213 --> 17:27.881
This is from Paul?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.022
I went to Booya Moon...

17:46.608 --> 17:48.610
from the airport lounge.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.614
I went again.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.451
It's still blocked.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.959
No way to the pool.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.670
No, try. Try.

18:08.297 --> 18:11.717
Try. Try again. Try again.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.387
You and me, Lisey.

18:17.389 --> 18:18.599
You and me.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.063
Oh, my God.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.152
How I loved you.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.488
I love you. I love you. Stop.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.240
Don't talk. Just...

18:35.324 --> 18:37.784
-Stop talking. Save your breath--
-I was lost in the dark.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.872
I was...

18:43.415 --> 18:45.083
lost in the dark.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.755
And you found me.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.176
You held me.

18:55.636 --> 18:57.137
No. No, no, no.

18:59.515 --> 19:00.724
No. No.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.018
Oh, baby.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.311
No.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.606
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Baby.

19:07.689 --> 19:08.815
Don't go.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.779
Babyluv.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.364
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.658
No, don't go, don't go.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.035
Don't go.

19:21.662 --> 19:23.580
Don't go.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.709
No, don't go.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.221
I don't know how
to be this way, hon.

23:09.223 --> 23:10.849
I don't know how to think it.

23:13.060 --> 23:14.978
You would know. You...

23:16.855 --> 23:18.065
You would know.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.360
You said saying is knowing.

23:25.113 --> 23:30.744
So-- So what do I--
what do I say? Do I say...

23:32.412 --> 23:34.373
Do I say you kicked the bucket?

23:38.043 --> 23:41.338
Do I say...

23:41.797 --> 23:44.633
you popped off?

23:49.429 --> 23:51.765
Are you eating a dirt sandwich?

23:55.102 --> 23:57.271
Are you riding the mystery train?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.611
Did you bite the big one?

24:07.698 --> 24:10.033
Pop your clogs?

24:11.952 --> 24:13.120
Peg out?

24:15.247 --> 24:16.456
No.

24:20.335 --> 24:21.628
Bought the farm?

24:22.713 --> 24:25.632
I don't know. What do I say?

24:26.717 --> 24:29.011
What is it? I don't know.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.556
I don't know how to think it.

24:36.268 --> 24:37.603
No light.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.773
No spark.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.279
No light.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.240
No spark.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.746
No light. No spark.

24:58.207 --> 24:59.541
No light.

25:02.461 --> 25:04.546
No spark.

27:28.524 --> 27:30.984
Base, this is Two
out on Sugartop Road.

27:31.610 --> 27:32.778
Thought you were 10-10.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.988
Thought I'd take another run
past the Landon place.

27:35.072 --> 27:37.533
I just have a funny feeling.
Then I'll be 10-10.

27:37.616 --> 27:38.617
Copy that. Out.

28:54.067 --> 28:55.068
Lisey.

28:56.695 --> 28:57.738
Lisey.

28:59.990 --> 29:00.991
Lisey.

29:04.119 --> 29:05.120
Lisey.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.055
Hey.

29:25.516 --> 29:26.975
What is that?

29:27.059 --> 29:31.021
Oh, it's a hockey stick.
A signed hockey stick.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.689
It was in her hubby's sports cupboard.

29:32.773 --> 29:36.735
Can't make out the name, though.
I think hockey players must be illiterate.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.696
It's Patrice Bergeron, and if anything
happens to it, Matt's gonna kill you.

29:40.989 --> 29:44.535
So, what's the plan?

29:45.994 --> 29:47.955
I'm gonna tackle him,
and then once he's down,

29:48.038 --> 29:50.165
you can pile on
and then I'm gonna take him to Booya--

29:50.249 --> 29:52.501
You're gonna take him
to that place that you went.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.836
Booya Moon?

29:58.048 --> 29:59.675
Jesus.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.802
Good. I hope the asshole gets soaked.

30:02.886 --> 30:05.430
Amanda, do you know why
you were a double?

30:05.514 --> 30:07.933
And the afghan too?
It was in both places at once.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.017
I'm sorry, the what?

30:09.101 --> 30:14.064
The afghan that Good Ma gave us
as a wedding present. Scott loved it.

30:15.232 --> 30:17.234
You married a very strange man.

30:17.943 --> 30:22.531
Scott was a double too. He was--
He was a double about eight years ago.

30:22.614 --> 30:25.242
He never said anything about doubles,
at least to me.

30:27.119 --> 30:29.162
He knew how to get there, Lisey,

30:29.246 --> 30:31.498
but beyond that,
I don't think he knew very much.

30:31.582 --> 30:32.875
No, but he knew about the pool,

30:32.958 --> 30:36.044
because he used to talk about it
all the time when he gave lectures.

30:36.128 --> 30:38.797
The pool where we all went down to drink.

30:38.881 --> 30:40.924
I thought it was a metaphor.

30:41.008 --> 30:42.384
Now you know better.

30:42.467 --> 30:43.802
What do you remember?

30:48.015 --> 30:52.311
I remember it was beautiful...

30:53.520 --> 30:54.563
and terrible.

30:56.231 --> 30:58.317
And I never want to go back there again.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.776
Good, then you're gonna stay here with us.

30:59.860 --> 31:01.361
Okay, I'll try, I'll try.

31:02.029 --> 31:04.114
What about the people on the benches?

31:04.198 --> 31:06.158
The ones that are wrapped up.
Who are they?

31:06.241 --> 31:08.577
I don't know. I don't want to
talk about the shrouded ones.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.622
-But what do you think they are?
-I don't want to talk about that.

31:11.705 --> 31:13.248
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.

31:13.332 --> 31:14.750
Don't get your panties in a bunch--

31:14.833 --> 31:17.961
Don't get your panties in a bunch if you
don't-- talk about things that I don't--

31:18.045 --> 31:19.505
Stop. Okay, both of you, stop it.

31:19.588 --> 31:22.216
Just-- Just go. Go hide.
Go into the bathroom and shut the door.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.384
He needs to think
that I'm alone when he comes.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.678
I do-- I do remember one thing.

31:27.763 --> 31:31.183
Not from Booya Moon. From--
From here. Something Scott said.

31:32.518 --> 31:34.311
Just after the...

31:36.522 --> 31:39.525
Last time that I-- that I cut myself,
you know, when I went dark,

31:39.608 --> 31:41.276
before he died.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.404
Something about a story.
It was Lisey's story, he said.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.742
He never dedicated
a book to you, did he?

31:48.825 --> 31:50.744
No. I asked him not to.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.037
Why?

31:52.120 --> 31:55.415
Because everything changed
once he became famous.

31:55.499 --> 31:57.376
You know, the world came in.

31:57.459 --> 32:00.504
You have to have a private part
to a marriage, a secret part.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.089
And if we hadn't have had that...

32:03.006 --> 32:05.968
we never would have survived
all this rich and famous shit.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.390
What was the story about?

32:13.308 --> 32:15.853
I don't think he said.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.731
If he did, I don't remember. I'm sorry.

32:22.985 --> 32:25.821
Do you really have a plan
for dealing with Dooley?

32:26.405 --> 32:27.406
I do.

32:28.991 --> 32:30.951
But we need a code word,
in case I need you.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.871
Oh, a safe word. Yeah, like S&M.

32:33.954 --> 32:36.915
What? Were you and Charlie into S&M?

32:36.999 --> 32:40.544
Oh, God, no. His idea of bedroom
excitement was leaving his socks on.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.087
What word, Lisey?

32:44.381 --> 32:45.382
"Greenlawn."

32:45.465 --> 32:47.968
So, you're gonna hear me talking to him--

32:48.051 --> 32:50.345
Wait, wait, wait.
Why are you talking to him?

32:50.429 --> 32:52.931
Because I need to talk to him.
I need to be close to him.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.391
I have to be close to him.

32:55.142 --> 32:59.938
Don't come out unless you hear
"Greenlawn." And then you can tackle him.

33:00.397 --> 33:03.150
-That's plan B?
-Yeah. That's plan B.

33:03.692 --> 33:07.362
Okay, plan B sucks.
And plan A makes absolutely no sense.

33:07.446 --> 33:10.532
Really doesn't sound like
it was thoroughly thought out, Lisey.

33:10.616 --> 33:13.535
Sometimes you have to let
the story tell itself.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.370
-Oh, I am begging you.
-No, no.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.289
-I am begging you to stop this bullshit.
-Come on, no.

33:17.372 --> 33:20.083
Sometimes you have to let
the story tell itself.

33:20.167 --> 33:23.462
You invited a maniac,
a fucking lunatic into your house!

33:23.545 --> 33:25.714
-Stop yelling. She knows what she--
-Just go hide.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.925
-She has no plan!
-Get into the bathroom. Shut the door.

33:28.008 --> 33:29.176
What am I supposed to do?

33:30.135 --> 33:31.136
Fuck.

33:33.931 --> 33:35.182
Get into the bathroom.

35:14.698 --> 35:15.991
I have to pee.

35:17.659 --> 35:18.660
No.

35:18.744 --> 35:20.120
Lisey?

35:20.204 --> 35:21.496
What?

35:21.580 --> 35:22.831
I have to pee.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.791
Well, you're in the right place for it.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.836
-Darla won't let me.
-Shut it.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.379
You're a grown woman, you can hold it.

35:29.463 --> 35:31.465
Be quiet. Both of you, be quiet.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.259
Mr. Dooley.

36:58.385 --> 36:59.720
I know you're here.

37:01.471 --> 37:02.764
I'm right here, Missus.

37:06.852 --> 37:08.979
You can't see me, but I can see you.

37:09.938 --> 37:11.023
You're lying.

37:11.523 --> 37:13.525
Well, if I'm lying, I'm dying, miss.

37:14.276 --> 37:16.028
What's that in your hand? Is that a gun?

37:16.653 --> 37:18.155
Why would I have a gun?

37:19.781 --> 37:21.617
We're here to make an exchange, right?

37:23.911 --> 37:26.121
Well, I got other business
with you tonight.

37:32.586 --> 37:34.129
You're here to kill me, aren't you?

37:35.255 --> 37:38.050
You know, that thing
you're hiding behind, that lighthouse,

37:38.550 --> 37:39.635
that was your husband's.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.845
That was Scott Landon's biggest prize.

37:42.763 --> 37:47.392
750,000 books sold for his greatest novel
ever written, Coaster's Daughter.

37:53.482 --> 37:55.442
I'm curious about something, Jim.

37:56.568 --> 37:59.655
I mean, I-- I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jim.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.115
I feel like we're friends now.

38:06.912 --> 38:08.330
I'll take that as a yes.

38:10.457 --> 38:14.586
There was something that Scott
talked about when he talked about writing.

38:14.670 --> 38:16.213
He said he learned it from Dickens.

38:16.839 --> 38:19.591
Well, I didn't come here
to talk about writing, Missus.

38:19.675 --> 38:20.884
What?

38:20.968 --> 38:22.928
What kind of a camper are you?

38:23.011 --> 38:25.722
You don't want to talk about
your favorite writer.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.225
"Beam me up, Scotty."

38:28.642 --> 38:30.978
-"Duty of love."
-I'm a prophet.

38:31.061 --> 38:33.105
"The duty of love,"
that's your favorite.

38:33.188 --> 38:36.108
I'm the greatest camper there ever was,
and I came here to make sure

38:36.191 --> 38:39.027
that Scott Landon's works
are shared with the entire world.

38:39.111 --> 38:44.533
Scott said that every character in a novel
had to be used twice.

38:45.617 --> 38:49.162
But there's one character in our story
that's been used only once.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.749
And that's-- that's Cole.

38:53.584 --> 38:56.920
The man who shot my husband
at that university in Tennessee.

38:57.004 --> 39:01.675
Hey, but you're from Tennessee. Right?

39:02.759 --> 39:06.555
-A Jim Dandy from the volunteer state?
-Shut up.

39:06.638 --> 39:08.307
You knew Cole.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.228
The man who shot my husband. Right?

39:13.896 --> 39:17.316
You know him from the mental hospital,
from the asylum.

39:17.399 --> 39:18.817
-Shut up!
-Yeah.

39:18.901 --> 39:23.322
Scott and I used to talk about
guys like you. All the time.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.782
We called you "deep space cowboys."

39:27.242 --> 39:29.661
Most of you are harmless. Right?

39:30.537 --> 39:32.664
But you and Cole aren't.

39:32.748 --> 39:34.875
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

39:34.958 --> 39:39.463
Just a couple of deep space cowboys
sitting around the mental hospital

39:39.546 --> 39:43.592
talking about
who Scott Landon belonged to.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.719
-And you're not a hero.
-Shut up!

39:45.802 --> 39:49.181
-You're not a hero.
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

39:49.264 --> 39:51.850
You're just a crazy fan!

39:53.268 --> 39:55.729
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

39:58.065 --> 39:59.608
You like my lighthouse?

40:00.901 --> 40:02.319
That's not your lighthouse!

40:02.402 --> 40:05.989
That is everyone's lighthouse!
That is Scott Landon's prize!

40:06.073 --> 40:07.699
You're my prize.

40:31.473 --> 40:35.143
Greenlawn! Greenlawn! Greenlawn!

40:37.104 --> 40:38.105
Hey!

40:39.064 --> 40:42.943
You fucker, you motherfucker!
Fucking die!

40:43.026 --> 40:45.070
Don't you mess with her, motherfucker!

40:45.571 --> 40:48.740
Hey! Come over here! Get me!

40:48.824 --> 40:49.825
Lisey!

40:54.538 --> 40:55.914
Oh, fuck!

40:58.208 --> 41:00.127
Die, die, die!

41:04.381 --> 41:05.591
Fuck off!

41:05.674 --> 41:09.761
You fucking asshole!
Get him off me! Get him off!

41:13.348 --> 41:14.349
Kill him.

41:26.612 --> 41:27.863
Respect!

41:38.373 --> 41:39.374
No wife!

41:43.462 --> 41:44.463
Respect!

43:34.281 --> 43:36.074
What are you trying to do to me, Missus?

45:07.708 --> 45:09.960
Always have to worry about motivation.

45:11.712 --> 45:13.130
Beware of coincidence.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.300
Explain situations.

45:17.301 --> 45:18.385
Which is bullshit!

45:19.178 --> 45:21.555
Because life doesn't work that way!

45:22.055 --> 45:23.182
Who are you with?

45:25.767 --> 45:26.894
Never did.

45:29.396 --> 45:31.190
Reality is a fucking dog.

45:31.273 --> 45:32.274
Who are you with?

45:32.357 --> 45:38.447
That somehow travels 1,500 miles
and ends up at home, three years later.

45:38.530 --> 45:42.367
You are just the wife!
You are not an artist!

45:42.451 --> 45:44.119
Reality is Ralph.

45:46.371 --> 45:48.248
You are not a poet!

45:48.332 --> 45:49.750
Reality is Ralph.

45:53.545 --> 45:55.297
You were just sleeping with him!

45:55.380 --> 45:56.632
Where'd you go?

45:56.715 --> 45:58.175
You're disgusting!

46:00.135 --> 46:02.596
-I know you're here.
-Don't be selfish!

46:04.014 --> 46:06.600
-Why won't you share?
-I know.

46:07.267 --> 46:08.977
Share with the world!

46:16.735 --> 46:17.736
Come here.

46:19.655 --> 46:20.656
Come here.

46:23.909 --> 46:27.412
Where are you?

46:29.373 --> 46:32.209
Where are you?

46:32.292 --> 46:33.710
Tell you one thing, Missus.

46:34.378 --> 46:35.921
You are not going home.

46:36.672 --> 46:39.800
You were the greatest mistake
he ever made!

46:39.883 --> 46:41.510
Come on!

46:41.593 --> 46:43.720
Come on!

46:44.346 --> 46:45.722
You're an ignorant bitch!

46:46.557 --> 46:47.933
Are you afraid?

46:48.016 --> 46:51.478
Fuck you! I am the lighthouse.

46:52.437 --> 46:55.983
-Come on, come on.
-I am a prophet.

47:01.321 --> 47:05.909
Come on! Come here! Come here!

47:12.833 --> 47:13.959
Help me.

47:32.561 --> 47:33.937
There you are.
