WEBVTT

01:23.458 --> 01:26.336
- So what you're telling me
Syfal,

01:26.336 --> 01:28.505
is that you haven't seen or
heard anything

01:28.505 --> 01:30.757
out of the ordinary lately?

01:30.757 --> 01:35.053
- (heavy breathing) Cayla
please,
I'm telling you the truth.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.973
I have not seen

01:40.391 --> 01:41.935
anything.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.396
- And you are certain
you haven't seen anybody

01:45.396 --> 01:47.440
who may of looked odd uh?

01:48.274 --> 01:53.279
- No, no I haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.490
Cayla please!

01:56.699 --> 01:59.160
I don't want to die!

01:59.160 --> 02:01.996
- Sil has seen this man in his
visions,

02:01.996 --> 02:04.666
so I know he's somewhere near.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.043
And you were given a simple task

02:07.043 --> 02:10.839
of keeping your eye open
and nose to the ground.

02:10.839 --> 02:15.510
- I'm telling you the truth.
(footsteps crunching)

02:15.510 --> 02:17.095
I haven't heard anything.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.140
- And I understand information

02:20.140 --> 02:22.809
can be elusive at times, I get
that.

02:23.893 --> 02:27.355
But what I don't get is
why you would do business

02:27.355 --> 02:30.191
with the resistance,
those underground shits

02:30.191 --> 02:33.862
who think that they can
overthrow Sil, your new Lord!

02:33.862 --> 02:35.363
- Wait Cayla, please!

02:35.363 --> 02:37.031
(heavy breathing)
(Cayla laughs)

02:37.031 --> 02:39.868
- You think we wouldn't find
out?

02:39.868 --> 02:42.036
- (groaning) Please!

02:45.707 --> 02:49.460
Cayla please, I was trying
to get information for you.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.588
- Shut up you lying shit!

02:51.588 --> 02:54.007
(Syfal screams)
- I never liked you Syfal.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.010
I would of slit your
throat a long time ago

02:57.010 --> 03:00.597
but Sil found your influence
useful.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.433
All you were to do was
to keep an eye on things

03:03.433 --> 03:07.020
and report back and in return
your family stays safe.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.856
But what do you do?

03:09.856 --> 03:12.859
Go and mingle with a
bunch of has been soldiers

03:12.859 --> 03:14.903
who think that they can
overthrow a God!

03:14.903 --> 03:16.070
Are you mad?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.030
(thudding)

03:17.030 --> 03:19.699
- Commander, he claims
to have seen two people

03:19.699 --> 03:21.201
running from the forest.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.754
- So child, tell me what you
saw.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.422
- I was chasing down a weasel
for food

03:34.422 --> 03:37.300
when I saw two people run from
the forest.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.927
- Did they run past you?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.137
- No, I was about 100 feet
behind a tree

03:41.137 --> 03:42.263
when I noticed them.

03:42.263 --> 03:46.226
- You said they ran out
of a forest, which forest?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.269
- The Forest of SiKoran.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.395
(heavy drum beat)

03:49.395 --> 03:51.731
- Are you sure it was SiKoran?

03:51.731 --> 03:52.565
- Yes

03:55.276 --> 03:56.611
- What did they look like?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.572
- They were too far for me to
see,

03:59.572 --> 04:02.450
but one had on a black
jacket with a hood and he was

04:02.450 --> 04:03.993
pulling someone else behind him.

04:03.993 --> 04:04.994
- Pulling?
- Yes!

04:04.994 --> 04:06.621
They were running pretty fast.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.831
- Why were they being chased?

04:08.831 --> 04:10.959
- I don't know, I didn't
see anyone behind them.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.169
(forboding music)

04:13.169 --> 04:14.545
- You shit!

04:14.545 --> 04:15.588
All this time you knew!

04:15.588 --> 04:16.923
(sword whooshing)
- No, no.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.466
(splattering)

04:18.466 --> 04:21.636
(footsteps crunching)

04:24.347 --> 04:27.183
- (sighs) Get up!

04:30.061 --> 04:32.563
(sword scraping)
Is that all you saw?

04:32.563 --> 04:33.648
- Yes Ms. Korvesian.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.367
- If you're lying to me
about any of this boy,

04:44.367 --> 04:47.161
I'll gut you and feed you to my
dogs.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.163
Do you understand?

04:49.163 --> 04:50.665
- Ye, Yes Ms. Korvesian.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.668
- Good, what's your name?

04:53.668 --> 04:54.585
- Orin.

04:54.585 --> 04:58.381
- Orin, you will take over
Syfal's role.

04:58.381 --> 05:02.218
Find information on any
nearby resistance groups

05:02.218 --> 05:04.762
and what roles Syfal played in
them.

05:04.762 --> 05:08.099
You have two weeks to report
back to me.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.309
Is that clear?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.311
- Yes, yes thank you Ms.
Kovesian.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.478
I won't let you down.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.690
- Of course, your life depends
on it.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.193
Go, begin!

05:20.695 --> 05:22.697
(footsteps crunching)

05:22.697 --> 05:24.699
- LyGon-Ril-Cylus-CorRegin!

05:24.699 --> 05:25.908
(clashing)

05:25.908 --> 05:30.913
(electric zapping)
(grunting)

05:34.042 --> 05:34.876
- Ah.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.254
Hmm.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.007
(dramatic chord)

05:43.509 --> 05:46.888
(blade whooshing)
(squelching)

05:46.888 --> 05:48.389
- Ah!
(thuds)

05:48.389 --> 05:50.433
- All of you, listen up!

05:50.433 --> 05:54.520
I am Cayla Korvesian,
commander of Sil's army.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.899
And you are now under the
rule of the new republic,

05:57.899 --> 05:59.734
Sil's republic!

05:59.734 --> 06:02.320
Your days of freedom are over!

06:02.320 --> 06:05.573
We decide what you can and
cannot have!

06:05.573 --> 06:09.243
We decide what you can and
cannot do!

06:09.243 --> 06:12.038
Your fate lies with us!

06:12.038 --> 06:13.664
Do you understand?

06:13.664 --> 06:14.665
- [All] Yes.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.755
- I can see in your eyes you
want me dead.

06:22.006 --> 06:26.344
Well I want you dead too
but my king has plans.

06:28.179 --> 06:32.850
If any of you decide to
run off, I will personally

06:32.850 --> 06:36.854
hunt you down and hang your
body parts from the trees.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.232
Do you understand?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.191
- [All] Yes.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.568
We own you!

06:44.570 --> 06:47.323
(footsteps)

06:47.323 --> 06:49.951
(upbeat music)

06:55.665 --> 06:58.334
(door clicking)

07:08.094 --> 07:09.387
- What?

07:09.387 --> 07:14.058
Monica, damn, can somebody
have a moment of peace?

07:14.058 --> 07:16.644
- What are you doing in a
bar this early in the morning

07:16.644 --> 07:18.229
during working hours?

07:18.229 --> 07:19.897
- For your information,
the owner let me in here

07:19.897 --> 07:22.567
and technically it's not open.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.819
Anyways, how the hell did you
find me?

07:24.819 --> 07:26.487
- That's what I do!

07:26.487 --> 07:28.364
Anyway, where is your little
friend Eric?

07:28.364 --> 07:30.450
- I don't know, you're his boss

07:30.450 --> 07:31.492
shouldn't you know?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.582
and all I got was his
corny little voicemails.

07:37.582 --> 07:41.169
- Well there you go, maybe
he got lucky and overslept.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.837
He did catch a nice one last
night.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.088
- Pff!

07:44.088 --> 07:46.591
- What, you jealous?

07:46.591 --> 07:49.635
- Ah no, it's just disgusting
how you guys

07:49.635 --> 07:51.179
see us as catches.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.849
- Yes we see them as catches.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.434
I didn't say anything about you.

07:57.351 --> 07:58.769
- Oh shut up!

07:58.769 --> 08:01.481
If you hear from him,
tell him to see me pronto,

08:01.481 --> 08:03.357
if he doesn't want to get
written up.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.193
Oh and also, Mills has some more
reports

08:05.193 --> 08:06.652
he needs him to do.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.528
- More work?

08:08.529 --> 08:11.032
He's already swamped with the
work you gave him yesterday.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.326
- Yeah well not much I can do.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.577
Mills is trying to save his ass

08:14.577 --> 08:15.703
by getting these reports ready

08:15.703 --> 08:17.246
for his presentation next month.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.582
- At Eric's expense?

08:19.582 --> 08:20.750
Unbelievable!

08:20.750 --> 08:22.960
- Like I said, not much I can
do.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.714
- Whatever, if you're done,
can I get back to work please?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.591
You're killing my vibe girl.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.092
- Vibe?

08:30.092 --> 08:31.844
You're not even suppose
to be listening to music

08:31.844 --> 08:34.222
on the job anyway, let alone in
a bar

08:34.222 --> 08:35.890
during working hours.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.351
- Shoo, go so I can get my work
done.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
- Shoo?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.270
You don't shoo me.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.563
You think you can just wave your
hand

08:42.563 --> 08:44.815
and I'll go running away 'cause
you wanna listen to music

08:44.815 --> 08:46.234
and act like you're doing work?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.568
In a bar?

08:47.568 --> 08:50.071
(laughs) Who do you think you
are?

08:50.071 --> 08:50.905
Prince?

08:52.406 --> 08:55.076
- Monica, you know I still
have that photo of you

08:55.076 --> 08:56.702
back in your experimental
college days.

08:56.702 --> 09:01.249
- Oh, don't you dare Jimmy,
you better give me that photo.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.833
- Then you let me get back to
work

09:02.833 --> 09:05.127
and you leave Eric alone.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.004
- Fine, whatever!

09:07.880 --> 09:09.131
But I'm still watching you.

09:09.131 --> 09:09.966
- Ew!

09:11.133 --> 09:12.093
- F-U Jimmy!

09:16.430 --> 09:19.433
- Ooh, whoever she is Eric,
I hope she's worth it.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.019
(upbeat music)

09:23.271 --> 09:26.274
(footsteps tapping)

09:27.525 --> 09:29.860
(door clicking)

09:29.860 --> 09:30.945
(electric zapping)

09:30.945 --> 09:32.655
- Must you keep throwing me
around?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.159
- What is, what is this, what is
this?

09:37.159 --> 09:40.329
- Good, the king's coming
through.

09:40.329 --> 09:43.332
(footsteps tapping)

09:47.295 --> 09:48.629
- What were those things

09:48.629 --> 09:51.257
that attacked me in the forest,
huh?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.926
Sofia, is that even your real
name?

09:53.926 --> 09:56.095
What is going on?

09:56.095 --> 09:59.140
(footsteps tapping)

09:59.140 --> 10:00.600
- Things that attacked you in
the forest

10:00.600 --> 10:02.435
are called The Children,

10:02.435 --> 10:05.062
mastered by an evil sorceress
named Sidra.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.481
Eric, I'll explain more later.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.985
I just need you to be quiet and
be still.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.864
(bottle clinking)
Here, have a drink!

10:14.864 --> 10:17.867
(footsteps tapping)

10:28.878 --> 10:29.837
- Sofia I...

10:32.089 --> 10:34.717
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
realize you were changing.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.513
- Eric please, haven't
seen a woman before?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.350
- Well yeah of course, I
didn't want you to think--

10:42.350 --> 10:44.852
- Alright, alright, stay where
you are

10:44.852 --> 10:47.188
if it makes you feel better.

10:55.446 --> 10:59.158
(fabric crinkling)

10:59.158 --> 11:01.661
(zipper zips)

11:05.539 --> 11:08.459
(footsteps tapping)

11:08.459 --> 11:09.585
- Wow, um.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.216
- Let me properly introduce
myself.

11:15.216 --> 11:19.762
My name is Sofia Hayden, army
commander of The City of Merc,

11:19.762 --> 11:22.056
your city Sire, and my duty

11:22.056 --> 11:23.849
is to help you get your memory
back.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.688
- My memory back, my memory is
just fine.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.565
I clearly remember you
slapping me on stage.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.651
- That I did, but I'm here

11:33.651 --> 11:35.903
to help you remember your true
self.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.238
- What?
- Please, sit down.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.239
Let me explain.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.450
- Uh, uh, oh on the floor?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.452
- Yes Eric, on the floor.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.844
- How do you feel?

11:59.844 --> 12:03.139
- Well, I mean, I mean, how,
how am I supposed to feel?

12:03.139 --> 12:05.558
Okay, I am trapped in a theater
with you

12:05.558 --> 12:07.226
and all I want to do is go home.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.062
- Do you feel any comfort at
all?

12:10.062 --> 12:10.896
- No!

12:12.606 --> 12:13.941
- Are you feeling stronger?

12:13.941 --> 12:15.609
- No Sofia I don't!

12:17.611 --> 12:19.405
- Okay, let me explain.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.492
You are on a planet
named Ressear, our Mother

12:24.577 --> 12:27.121
and you are not really Eric
Wilson.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.958
You are the reincarnation of
a King named Zhayian Crehin.

12:31.792 --> 12:36.297
Lord of Merc, master of
the Nebtonian art form.

12:36.297 --> 12:40.134
You ruled over the Eastern
sector 2000 years ago.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.095
- Wait, wait, hold on.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.182
So your saying that this is not
Earth

12:46.182 --> 12:48.934
but a planet called Rosser.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.645
- It's pronounced Ressear.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.983
- Okay, alright, yes, so if
that's true,

12:55.983 --> 12:57.318
how did I get here?

12:57.318 --> 12:59.403
Do you own a spaceship or
something?

12:59.403 --> 13:01.322
- No, I bridged you over.

13:01.322 --> 13:06.327
- Bridged me over, you mean
like beam me up Scotty?

13:06.327 --> 13:09.663
- Something like that, just more
organic.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.499
- Okay, yeah.

13:11.499 --> 13:15.336
- Don't mock me Eric, this is
not a joke!

13:15.336 --> 13:17.338
A great soldier and good
friend gave his life

13:17.338 --> 13:19.924
creating this bridge to find
you!

13:19.924 --> 13:21.592
- I'm sorry, I am sorry.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.970
- His name was Akinnis, remember
that!

13:26.430 --> 13:29.433
He was the only one that
believed in prophecy.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.851
He believed in you.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.312
- Alright alright.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.772
- We have a new threat.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.317
(fire flickering)
A gifted warlock named Yahzeel

13:38.317 --> 13:40.319
who's taking over most of
Ressear.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.153
(screeching)

13:45.366 --> 13:49.370
Combine forces and take over
both Ressear

13:49.370 --> 13:50.663
and your planet, Earth.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.874
- Why does he need Yahzeel?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.876
- Because he can't do it
himself.

13:55.876 --> 13:56.919
(whooshing)

14:01.757 --> 14:03.968
Only Yahzeel
(background screeching)

14:03.968 --> 14:06.887
has the power and intellect to
do so.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.391
- And so you think that
I can help with this?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.309
- Of course, you're Lord Crehin.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.521
But you can't do it yourself.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.856
You need to find the other three

14:16.856 --> 14:19.066
and assemble the Royal Four.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.359
- The Royal Four?

14:20.359 --> 14:23.654
- Yes, that is how the
citizens began to call you

14:23.654 --> 14:25.781
after you defeated Yahzeel.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.535
- Look Sofia, look, lo,
I am no hero king, okay,

14:29.535 --> 14:32.246
and this world that you
live in doesn't even

14:32.246 --> 14:35.416
sound like a place that I
wanna be a part of, okay?

14:35.416 --> 14:38.460
I am just Eric Wilson an
analyst, alright?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.462
And thanks to you, I--
- Okay.

14:42.256 --> 14:46.343
I'll take you back, but let
me do this one first, okay?

14:50.681 --> 14:52.391
- This is the Stone of Essence.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.811
After you guys defeated Yahzeel,

14:55.811 --> 14:58.272
you had the four of you insert a
part

14:58.272 --> 15:00.941
of your essence into this stone.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.775
- Why?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.779
- To help find you in your new
bodies,

15:05.779 --> 15:08.741
in case a great evil
threatens our Mother again.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.577
And only someone strong

15:11.577 --> 15:14.955
and pure of heart would
be able to command it.

15:14.955 --> 15:18.500
- So I'm guessing you're the
strong and pure of heart.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.002
- So far.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.880
- To be sure that you're Lord
Crehin,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.590
I need to see if your blood
flows

15:24.590 --> 15:25.716
with our Mothers energy.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.302
- Wha, wait, hold on, so you
plan on

15:28.302 --> 15:29.845
cutting me open or something?

15:29.845 --> 15:32.264
- No, I just need you to stay
seated

15:33.265 --> 15:34.934
and if this doesn't work,

15:34.934 --> 15:38.187
I promise, I will take
you back myself, okay?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.648
(clicks tongue)

15:40.648 --> 15:41.899
(sighs)

15:41.899 --> 15:45.486
- Alright, fine, let's get this
over with.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.571
- Keep your palms closed.

15:55.829 --> 16:00.834
(Sofia softly chants)
(ominous music)

16:05.881 --> 16:09.343
(loud whooshing)

16:09.343 --> 16:10.344
(grinding)

16:17.559 --> 16:22.523
Ooh! (groaning) stop
please, please stop, stop!

16:36.704 --> 16:39.540
(heavy breathing)

16:41.125 --> 16:44.211
(gentle music)

16:44.211 --> 16:45.045
- No, no.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.093
But the stone glowed.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.223
Maybe I was in the right area

16:56.223 --> 16:57.516
but I had the wrong guy.

16:59.643 --> 17:00.477
So why?

17:00.477 --> 17:03.355
(heavy breathing)

17:03.355 --> 17:04.189
All I have to do

17:04.189 --> 17:05.399
is take him back
(digital zapping)

17:05.399 --> 17:07.568
and look for a more robust man.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.155
Yeah.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.408
(electric zapping)

17:14.408 --> 17:16.285
- Gom BY Ronen Boa!

17:16.285 --> 17:17.578
(loud bang)

17:17.578 --> 17:20.414
(heavy thud)
- Ah!

17:22.750 --> 17:25.586
(heavy breathing)

17:28.630 --> 17:30.340
- Go Ron Bi Corr Vel Oa!

17:30.340 --> 17:32.509
(loud bang)

17:32.509 --> 17:34.053
Where's my wife?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.846
Where is my son?

17:35.846 --> 17:37.347
Speak maggot!

17:37.347 --> 17:38.182
- I brought you back

17:40.684 --> 17:41.685
Speak!

17:41.685 --> 17:44.104
- Our Mother is in great danger.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.607
We need you to help
assemble the Royal Four!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.192
- What do you know of us?

17:48.192 --> 17:50.110
- I know you are heroes.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.946
You saved our Mother from
Yahzeel

17:52.946 --> 17:55.407
and you created the Stone
of Essence to find you.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.785
- Only the strong and pure of
heart

17:57.785 --> 18:00.746
can find the Stone of
Essence and wheel its power.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.622
Is this you?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.040
- Yes sire.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.042
- Then show me my stone.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.590
- Here is the Stone of Essence.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.927
(dramatic music)

18:14.927 --> 18:19.932
- (exhales sharply) It's
been a long time my friend.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.186
I can still feel us all in here.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.772
Let's find our comrades.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.775
- Sire?

18:29.775 --> 18:32.152
- Who are you and what is your
title?

18:32.152 --> 18:35.989
- I'm Sofia Hayden, army
commander of your kingdom Merc.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.325
- Army commander?
- Yes sire.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.869
- What day and age is this?

18:40.869 --> 18:42.162
- 21st century sire.

18:43.997 --> 18:44.832
- Interesting.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.878
If you are who you say you are,
show me your soldiers mark.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.138
- Army commander, good to meet
you.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.558
Now who's this creature
that threatens our Mother?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.143
- His name is Sil.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.479
He's taken over many
lands and plans on finding

19:07.479 --> 19:10.649
and resurrect Yahzeel.
- (loud crunching) Yahzeel!

19:10.649 --> 19:12.359
What does he know about Yahzeel?

19:12.359 --> 19:13.694
- I believe he wants to use him

19:13.694 --> 19:16.363
to take over--
- Yahzeel cannot be used.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.365
He cannot be reasoned with.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.034
That's why we buried
his corpse so far down.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.035
There nobody--
(loud bang)

19:22.035 --> 19:25.038
(voices whispering)

19:25.038 --> 19:25.873
Ooh!

19:27.624 --> 19:30.085
Who are these people in my head?

19:30.085 --> 19:32.880
(loud whooshing)

19:34.965 --> 19:36.550
Get out of my head!

19:37.467 --> 19:42.139
(screaming)
(whooshing)

19:43.015 --> 19:44.725
(loud banging)

19:44.725 --> 19:45.559
Ah!

19:47.477 --> 19:48.729
By Loe Bor, Ah!

19:50.981 --> 19:52.316
(loud whooshing)

19:52.316 --> 19:53.400
- Sofia!

19:53.400 --> 19:55.986
(groaning)

19:55.986 --> 19:57.196
What are you doing?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.739
(loud bang)

19:58.739 --> 19:59.573
- Gah!

20:02.534 --> 20:05.245
(loud whooshing)

20:11.335 --> 20:12.920
- Sire, sire, sire?

20:16.590 --> 20:17.507
Sire, sire.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.345
Hm.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.723
Welcome home sire.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.811
(birds tweeting)

20:31.104 --> 20:34.274
(footsteps crunching)

20:41.657 --> 20:44.493
(heavy breathing)

20:58.632 --> 21:01.551
(foreboding music)

21:16.108 --> 21:17.442
- They're close.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.615
(low growling)

21:23.615 --> 21:26.118
(tense music)

21:29.496 --> 21:31.748
(growling)

21:55.522 --> 22:00.527
(suspenseful music)
(creature growling)

22:19.713 --> 22:22.424
(dramatic music)

23:58.603 --> 23:59.813
- You were one of us?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.152
Oh my god.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.736
What has Sil done to you?

24:06.736 --> 24:07.571
To us?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.157
If I had known brother...

24:15.495 --> 24:17.080
Rest,

24:17.080 --> 24:19.249
and may Mother find you a
peaceful vessel.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.002
(dramatic music)

24:28.216 --> 24:32.762
(hisses)
(dramatic music)

24:32.762 --> 24:37.767
(growling)
(bones cracking)

24:39.728 --> 24:42.522
- [Soldier] Lord, are you
alright?

24:43.440 --> 24:46.193
(dramatic music)

24:52.407 --> 24:54.701
- Commander, it's Lord Sil.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.122
- Yes, my love.
- Where are you?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.542
- I just leaving Syfal.
- Good.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.712
Meet me at the northern end
of SiKoran by the bridge.

25:05.712 --> 25:08.131
- SiKoran, why in--
- Cayla, just be there!

25:09.216 --> 25:10.300
- What is it?

25:10.300 --> 25:12.552
- He wants us to meet him in
SiKoran.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.931
- SiKoran, why?
- I don't know,

25:15.931 --> 25:19.059
but if he insists, it must be
important.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.188
(phone ringing)

25:24.397 --> 25:27.317
- Ahh, Vowlan, I haven't heard
from you in quite some time.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.069
You better have good news for
me.

25:29.069 --> 25:32.197
- [Vowlan] Yes, my lord,
we have got Yahzeel.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.698
- Are you sure it's Yahzeel?

25:33.698 --> 25:35.075
- [Vowlan] It is him.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.077
- Are you positive?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.578
- [Vowlan] Yes, I am very
positive.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.164
- Good work Vowlan, very good.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.084
Make sure to secure the area.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.169
- [Vowlan] But there was a
problem.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.921
SiKoran has woken.

25:47.921 --> 25:48.880
- What?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.257
- [Vowlan] He's killing
everyone.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.550
- I'll take care of it.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.135
You just make sure nothing
comes near that site.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.387
You understand!

25:55.387 --> 25:57.138
- [Vowlan] Yes, I do.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.518
(dramatic music)

26:18.785 --> 26:21.621
- Where did you learn
to fight like that, boy?

26:22.831 --> 26:24.499
- Fight like what?

26:24.499 --> 26:26.793
I was just trying to defend
myself.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.379
- Don't lie to me.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.090
Where did you learn to fight
like that?

26:32.090 --> 26:33.466
Who trained you?

26:34.342 --> 26:36.636
What is your species?

26:36.636 --> 26:38.805
- I, I'm just a villager, I
swear.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.181
That goon was trying to kill me,
okay.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.351
I just did what came natural.
- Exactly!

26:43.351 --> 26:48.315
Common villagers don't
fight like that, unless

26:48.481 --> 26:50.275
they're some type of spy.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.819
Are you this,

26:52.819 --> 26:54.446
a spy,

26:54.446 --> 26:55.989
villager?

26:55.989 --> 26:58.825
Are you some sort of resistance
groupie

26:58.825 --> 27:01.995
hoping to bring back the good
old days?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.664
(laughs)

27:04.664 --> 27:05.707
Maybe I should open you up

27:05.707 --> 27:08.376
and spill your hope all over the
ground.

27:08.376 --> 27:09.919
- Please, Miss, I'm not a spy
for the--

27:09.919 --> 27:13.089
- It's Lieutenant Kryst to you,
boy.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.885
- I'm sorry Lieutenant.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.138
But I'm not a spy for the
resistance.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.350
I'm a spy for the New Republic.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.309
- Really?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.187
How so?

27:27.187 --> 27:29.356
- Commander Korvesian
tasked with a mission.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.525
I'm supposed to locate any
nearby resistance groups

27:32.525 --> 27:34.194
and report back to her.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.696
- Commander Cayla Korvesian

27:36.696 --> 27:38.990
task you with a mission?

27:39.866 --> 27:41.201
- Yes.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.410
I'm supposed to infiltrate their
ranks

27:42.410 --> 27:44.037
and find out what my town leader
knew

27:44.037 --> 27:45.205
and report back to her.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.293
- What sector are you from?

27:52.379 --> 27:53.505
- The western sector.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.133
- That's Syfal's area.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.887
How you plan to do this
without him knowing?

28:04.182 --> 28:05.016
- He's dead.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.352
Cayla killed him.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.189
- That would make it easier.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.402
Does the Commander know
about your fighting skill?

28:16.403 --> 28:17.862
- No, I don't have one.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.198
Look, I've seen your
soldiers fight before.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.701
I just tried a few moves and got
lucky.

28:22.701 --> 28:27.080
- Moves like that are not built
with luck.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.958
You'll come with us and I'll
find out who you really are.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.460
- Please, Lieutenant, please

28:32.460 --> 28:34.254
I have to complete this mission,

28:34.254 --> 28:36.548
otherwise my village is
gonna be slaughtered.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.467
- That is not my concern.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.761
Guard.

28:41.761 --> 28:46.766
(dramatic music)
(phone keys beeping)

28:46.766 --> 28:48.393
- [Quilinresh] This is
Supreme World Alliance.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.978
- Hello Quilinresh,

28:49.978 --> 28:51.688
I'm needing to schedule
an emergency meeting

28:51.688 --> 28:53.565
with the committee tonight.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.108
- [Quilinresh] Ooh, it's
kind of last minute.

28:55.108 --> 28:55.942
I don't know if I can--

28:55.942 --> 28:57.193
- I'm sure you can gather them.

28:57.193 --> 28:58.528
- [Quilinresh] Well, you
know tomorrow is the event--

28:58.528 --> 29:00.739
- Yes, yes, I know Kyten is-
- Good,

29:00.739 --> 29:02.323
so they don't really want any
disturbance during this time.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.284
- Cut me off again, Quilinresh,

29:04.284 --> 29:07.495
and I will send Cayla to visit
your family tonight instead.

29:08.663 --> 29:09.998
- [Quilinresh] What about 9:00
p.m.?

29:09.998 --> 29:12.459
- Yes, 9:00 p.m. will be
perfect.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.293
- [Quilinresh] Good.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.294
- We'll be dining in the Red
Chamber.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.045
- [Quilinresh] Then I'll
go and contact them.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.714
- Good, see you there.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.432
- Lieutenant, please listen to
me.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.558
If I was to come with you,

29:28.558 --> 29:30.018
and Commander Korvesian finds
out

29:30.018 --> 29:31.269
that you interfered with a
mission

29:31.269 --> 29:32.479
directly instructed by her,

29:32.479 --> 29:34.481
how is that gonna look on you?

29:35.440 --> 29:37.150
You really want to take that
chance?

29:37.150 --> 29:39.652
She's known as The Daughter of
Demons.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.447
Do you really wanna gamble with
her?

29:45.492 --> 29:46.826
- Guard,

29:46.826 --> 29:48.369
call headquarters.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.871
Confirm the story.

29:58.254 --> 30:01.424
- Lieutenant, they do not
know anything about this.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.384
- Of course they wouldn't.

30:03.384 --> 30:04.844
I just came from her an hour
ago.

30:07.263 --> 30:08.348
- Call the Commander!

30:09.182 --> 30:10.558
- Directly?

30:10.558 --> 30:11.643
We're normally not allowed to--

30:11.643 --> 30:13.645
- Shut up and just do it!

30:18.024 --> 30:20.693
(phone ringing)

30:21.778 --> 30:23.196
- No one's answering.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.868
- It's your call, Lieutenant.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.537
- I know it's my call!

30:30.537 --> 30:32.247
Just shut up and let me think!

30:37.210 --> 30:38.044
Fuck!

30:39.128 --> 30:40.255
Okay,

30:40.255 --> 30:41.631
spy!

30:41.631 --> 30:44.425
Go ahead and complete your task.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.429
But if I find out you're lying
to me...

30:53.059 --> 30:57.313
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Don't thank me.

30:57.313 --> 31:00.358
You just better be right for
your sake.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.742
Keep a tag on him.

31:09.742 --> 31:12.537
As soon as he reaches the
resistance,

31:12.537 --> 31:14.747
send me his coordinates.

31:17.458 --> 31:20.420
It's time for things
to change around here.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.172
(dramatic music)

31:56.831 --> 31:57.790
- [Guard] Lord Sil.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.463
[Both] My love.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.257
- My beautiful demons, tell
me, what have you learned?

32:07.300 --> 32:08.217
- Not much,

32:10.845 --> 32:13.848
out of this forest by
someone in a black cloak.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.767
- Who saw him?

32:17.393 --> 32:20.897
- A young boy from Syfal's
village named Orin.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.315
- Was Syfal aware of this?

32:22.315 --> 32:24.817
- [Cayla] He was, but he lied
about it.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.486
- [Sil] Where is he now?

32:26.486 --> 32:29.989
- Still in the barn with a
severed head.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.157
- Good.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.700
Anything on the Resistance?

32:32.700 --> 32:35.453
- No, but I gave that young Orin
a task

32:35.453 --> 32:36.663
to find out what he can

32:36.663 --> 32:39.207
and report back to me in two
weeks.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.334
- [Sil] Are you so sure
you can trust this kid?

32:41.334 --> 32:44.045
- If he wants a family to come
back to.

32:44.045 --> 32:48.007
Besides, no one knows Syfal's
dead beyond that barn.

32:48.007 --> 32:51.302
The Resistance will just
look at him as some loner.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.887
- And from what we gathered,

32:52.887 --> 32:54.639
the king's protector may have
taken him

32:54.639 --> 32:56.391
to the northern sector of the
city.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.686
- Well, you may not
need to concern yourself

32:59.686 --> 33:01.729
with his location any longer.

33:01.729 --> 33:05.358
I've just had a very clear
vision of him running down a
road

33:05.358 --> 33:06.609
alone.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.319
- Can you see which road he's
on?

33:08.319 --> 33:10.530
- No, which is why I brought you
here.

33:11.739 --> 33:12.573
As you know,

33:13.700 --> 33:15.868
we stand in the mighty Forest of
SiKoran

33:17.161 --> 33:18.830
grown from the ashes of the
legendary monk

33:18.830 --> 33:23.543
Reynu SiKoran himself,
thousand of years ago.

33:23.543 --> 33:27.046
His roots run deep within
Mother,

33:27.046 --> 33:29.924
linking us all in millions of
ways.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.721
I can use his essence to
find their exact location.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.599
- My love, entering into
an immortal's essence pool

33:38.599 --> 33:39.892
is suicide.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.352
It's too dangerous.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.979
It's pull is too strong.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.897
It could drain you till you're
dead.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.315
- Il-Roserious is right.

33:46.315 --> 33:48.651
You very powerful my love,

33:48.651 --> 33:52.947
but SiKoran is one of the Five
Immortal Wonders of Ressear.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.615
No one has ever survived

33:54.615 --> 33:56.617
after tampering with their
essence pool.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.999
- None of them were me.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.505
It is time for SiKoran
and all life on Ressear

34:09.505 --> 34:11.174
to know that I am a God!

34:12.216 --> 34:15.219
(creature growling)

34:17.972 --> 34:20.183
Stay down you wicked creature!

34:20.183 --> 34:22.268
I am your Lord now!

34:22.268 --> 34:27.273
(creature growling)
(speaking in foreign language)

34:31.527 --> 34:34.614
You listen to me now Reynu!

34:34.614 --> 34:37.784
(creature screeching)

34:44.290 --> 34:46.501
(growling)

34:46.501 --> 34:47.668
Down creature!

35:01.557 --> 35:03.476
- My Lord you...

35:03.476 --> 35:04.769
What you did was...

35:05.686 --> 35:07.563
The power running through your
body

35:07.563 --> 35:09.816
would have killed the
strongest of art forms.

35:10.817 --> 35:11.943
How do you feel?

35:13.486 --> 35:14.654
- I feel marvelous!

35:15.822 --> 35:19.158
SiKorn's essence is everything I
imagined.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.286
And now he belongs to me.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.663
He's under my control.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.249
- Do you need anything?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.502
- Yes.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.380
I need for you to bring me
the king's head in a bag

35:32.380 --> 35:33.923
and place it on my table.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.802
I wanna be able to look him in
the eyes

35:37.802 --> 35:39.512
While I enjoy my meal.

35:40.763 --> 35:43.057
- Did you happen to see where he
is?

35:44.433 --> 35:47.270
(dramatic music)

35:48.896 --> 35:51.691
- The king is headed for the
Ti Forest on the west end.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.986
He'll be there within the hour.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.529
- You should join us my love.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.364
It will be fun.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.534
- You go enjoy yourselves.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.702
I have much to do.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.914
But hurry, we're having company
tonight.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.291
A new era has begun.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.798
(tense music)

36:17.925 --> 36:20.761
(dramatic music)

36:21.762 --> 36:24.056
You thought you can hide Yahzeel
from me,

36:24.056 --> 36:25.433
didn't you SiKoran?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.351
Do you need help, miss?

36:28.519 --> 36:30.479
You answer to me now.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.732
(growling)

36:32.732 --> 36:33.900
Once I revive Yahzeel

36:35.234 --> 36:38.237
and learn the art forms of the
Royal 4,

36:38.237 --> 36:41.616
I will be a god among gods.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.117
(dramatic music)

36:43.117 --> 36:43.951
Ressear,

36:44.076 --> 36:45.536
(Fire swoosh)

36:45.703 --> 36:46.954
Earth,

36:48.122 --> 36:51.751
and all living things will bow
before me.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.923
(dramatic music)

37:08.100 --> 37:08.935
- Hello?

37:10.519 --> 37:11.354
Are you okay?

37:12.438 --> 37:13.940
My name, my name is Eric.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.942
Do you need help, Ms. Um...

37:18.069 --> 37:19.528
- Well, hello.

37:19.528 --> 37:22.281
(dramatic music)

37:24.617 --> 37:27.286
(Eric grunting)

37:28.120 --> 37:30.206
- Who are you people?

37:30.206 --> 37:31.290
Are you with Sophia?

37:31.290 --> 37:32.458
- Sophia?

37:32.458 --> 37:35.711
I don't know any Sophia, but I
know you.

37:35.711 --> 37:39.632
My Lord says you are one of the
legendary Royal 4.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.842
- Look, I don't know what you're
talking about, okay?

37:41.842 --> 37:43.761
I am no king.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.972
- How did you know we were
talking about kings?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.390
- Does it matter?

37:47.390 --> 37:48.224
Okay?

37:48.224 --> 37:50.643
I am not part of no Royal 4.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.939
- Yes you are, yes you are.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.609
Sil says you are the
reincarnation, one of the kings.

37:58.609 --> 38:00.820
So which one are you?

38:00.820 --> 38:04.824
- (grunts) Look, this is just a
big misunderstanding, okay?

38:04.824 --> 38:05.700
I was held--

38:05.700 --> 38:07.368
(shushing)

38:07.368 --> 38:09.370
(Cayla sniffs)

38:09.370 --> 38:11.205
- You do smell different.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.834
- (grunts) Ah, bitch.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.877
- No, my name is Cayla.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.340
(ominous music)

38:26.470 --> 38:29.473
You are special.

38:29.473 --> 38:33.352
I've never tasted blood from an
ancient before.

38:33.352 --> 38:35.271
You could say you're my first.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.190
(metal scraping)

38:38.190 --> 38:40.318
(Eric grunting)

38:40.318 --> 38:43.863
You haven't realized yet, but
before you do,

38:43.863 --> 38:45.906
Sil wants your head back in a
bag.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.243
Of course, I'd prefer to keep
you as my pet,

38:53.414 --> 38:54.623
but such is life.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.710
(whizzing)

38:57.710 --> 39:00.546
(dramatic music)

39:15.394 --> 39:17.396
- Sire, stay behind me.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.405
- Did you just hit me with a
rock?

39:26.405 --> 39:28.449
That wasn't very nice.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.244
So what do we call you?

39:33.746 --> 39:37.583
- My name is Sofia Hayden, army
commander of Merc.

39:39.668 --> 39:40.795
- The City of Merc?

39:42.671 --> 39:45.508
I thought we buried all you
cockroaches.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.760
- [Sofia] As long as I still
breath,

39:47.760 --> 39:49.804
Merc lives, Cayla Korvesian.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.516
- Oh, so you know me?

39:54.642 --> 39:58.521
- Of course, a sadistic bitch
with daddy issues.

39:59.730 --> 40:04.735
- Well, I killed daddy, so he's
not an issue anymore.

40:07.613 --> 40:10.991
Look, let's get this over with,
shall we?

40:10.991 --> 40:13.327
Hand over your king and I'll let
you live.

40:14.286 --> 40:15.913
- So let's get it over with.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.793
Talingol byne kon-yet.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.380
(fire roaring)

40:24.380 --> 40:26.715
(whooshing)

40:34.557 --> 40:37.268
So what they say is true about
the Korvesians.

40:38.602 --> 40:41.439
Your bloodline is resistant to
chants.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.149
- Well, this isn't fair.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.067
You know quite a bit about me,

40:45.067 --> 40:49.697
but I've never heard of you,
Sofia Hayden.

40:49.697 --> 40:51.157
- Commander Hayden to you!

40:53.993 --> 40:56.996
(pistol firing)

40:56.996 --> 40:59.748
(metal clanging)

41:02.168 --> 41:04.753
- Girl, if you wanna piece of
me,

41:04.753 --> 41:07.131
you're gonna have to do it the
old fashion way.

41:10.384 --> 41:14.096
- Then, so be it.

41:14.096 --> 41:17.099
(suspenseful music)

41:32.156 --> 41:37.161
(swords clanging) (tense music)

41:47.379 --> 41:50.341
(thuds) (Cayla grunts)

41:50.341 --> 41:53.135
(swords clanging)

41:53.135 --> 41:55.137
(thuds)

41:56.305 --> 41:57.932
(Sofia grunts)

41:57.932 --> 42:00.768
(inhales sharply)

42:18.869 --> 42:22.331
(swords faintly clanging)

42:24.750 --> 42:26.418
- The king is over there.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.754
I'm gonna go get the king, you
help Cayla.

42:33.425 --> 42:35.761
(tense music)

42:35.761 --> 42:37.763
(thuds)

42:39.181 --> 42:41.684
(Sofia sighs)

42:42.685 --> 42:44.853
- Come on soldier, you're not
gonna let

42:44.853 --> 42:47.106
a little tap on the jaw stop all
this fun.

42:54.446 --> 42:55.739
(swords clanging)

42:55.739 --> 42:58.742
(suspenseful music)

43:00.786 --> 43:02.121
- Come on, girl.

43:03.038 --> 43:08.043
Don't let a little push on the
jaw stop all this fun.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.553
(swords clanging)

43:17.553 --> 43:19.555
(thuds)

43:26.478 --> 43:29.315
(Sophia grunting)

43:38.782 --> 43:40.326
- Sofia, watch out!

43:54.715 --> 43:58.844
- By day or by night, I raise my
sword to the light,

43:58.844 --> 44:01.847
I raise my sword to fight.

44:01.847 --> 44:06.727
To protect the kingdom of Merc,
as mother as my might.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.189
(Tenan yells)

44:10.189 --> 44:12.316
(thuds)

44:12.316 --> 44:13.150
(whooshing) (scraping)

44:13.150 --> 44:14.443
(thuds)

44:14.443 --> 44:16.028
(gurgling)

44:16.028 --> 44:17.488
(whooshing)

44:17.488 --> 44:19.865
- Commander, you're all clear!

44:19.865 --> 44:20.908
Kick her ass!

44:24.411 --> 44:25.371
You alright?

44:25.371 --> 44:27.206
- Yeah, yeah.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.123
- Behind you, behind you!

44:28.123 --> 44:30.626
(tense music)

44:31.877 --> 44:34.046
- Ah, the famous Tenan Fy.

44:35.839 --> 44:36.674
(Tenan grunts)

44:36.674 --> 44:38.676
(thuds)

44:39.885 --> 44:42.388
(tense music)

44:48.602 --> 44:50.896
- I see you're still on the
wrong side of things--

44:50.896 --> 44:51.980
- Don't!

44:51.980 --> 44:52.815
She's dead.

44:53.899 --> 44:58.487
I'm now IL-Roserious,
Quinsentian leader,

44:58.487 --> 45:01.073
better known as the Painted
Guard.

45:02.116 --> 45:06.286
And I am gonna make certain that
you fall!

45:07.246 --> 45:08.580
- How did it come to this?

45:09.998 --> 45:12.084
- My eyes are open, Tenan.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.419
Wake up!

45:13.419 --> 45:15.295
The Nebtonian life is over!

45:16.171 --> 45:18.632
This world belongs to Sil now.

45:18.632 --> 45:21.301
Accept it or die, Tenan.

45:23.095 --> 45:25.764
- Okay, fine.

45:25.764 --> 45:28.142
You choose to die by the hand of
an old friend,

45:29.059 --> 45:29.977
then come on!

45:30.811 --> 45:33.564
(dramatic music)

45:42.990 --> 45:45.951
(blades whooshing)

45:49.455 --> 45:52.291
(swords clanging)

45:55.502 --> 45:58.422
(blades whooshing)

45:59.506 --> 46:00.340
(thuds)

46:00.340 --> 46:02.426
(grunts)

46:08.140 --> 46:10.142
(thuds)

46:11.268 --> 46:14.521
- Your skin can't hold up
against my blades forever,
Tenan!

46:14.521 --> 46:15.773
(grunts)

46:15.773 --> 46:20.652
(blades whooshing) (thuds)

46:21.653 --> 46:24.656
(suspenseful music)

46:27.826 --> 46:29.828
(thuds)

46:31.413 --> 46:33.749
(whooshing)

46:35.542 --> 46:38.504
(blades whooshing)

46:40.130 --> 46:43.967
(Painted Guard yelling)

46:43.967 --> 46:44.802
- Fuck!

46:45.677 --> 46:46.512
(Painted Guard grunts)

46:46.512 --> 46:47.387
(Tenan grunts)

46:47.387 --> 46:49.389
(thuds)

46:56.021 --> 46:57.439
(Tenan yells)

46:57.439 --> 47:01.109
(blades whooshing)

47:01.109 --> 47:03.695
(thuds)

47:03.695 --> 47:06.573
(blades whooshing)

47:08.534 --> 47:10.536
(thuds)

47:13.914 --> 47:15.082
- Tam-ki-yian!

47:16.875 --> 47:18.710
(whooshing)

47:18.710 --> 47:20.254
(booming explosion)

47:20.254 --> 47:21.213
(ominous music)

47:21.213 --> 47:23.048
(Painted Guard yells)

47:23.048 --> 47:25.300
(grunting)

47:34.560 --> 47:36.728
(panting)

47:39.898 --> 47:42.150
(grunting)

47:50.534 --> 47:54.830
(whooshing) (thuds)

48:02.629 --> 48:05.632
(metallic rattling)

48:08.552 --> 48:10.387
- Look, I don't know how you
are,

48:10.387 --> 48:12.514
but you seem to be the reason
for all this.

48:12.514 --> 48:14.766
Stay down and don't move.

48:14.766 --> 48:16.101
- [Eric] Okay, okay.

48:16.101 --> 48:18.729
- And if I catch you trying to
leave, I'll kill you.

48:18.729 --> 48:19.605
- [Eric] Understood.

48:19.605 --> 48:24.610
- Okay? - Yeah.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.488
(tense music)

48:39.499 --> 48:41.501
(thuds)

48:46.006 --> 48:47.174
- Threesome, huh?

48:48.508 --> 48:49.343
Okay.

48:55.474 --> 48:56.350
(Cayla yells)

48:56.350 --> 48:58.936
(Tenan grunts)

49:00.437 --> 49:01.813
You're a Croarthian!

49:03.065 --> 49:05.317
No matter, I'll find your weak
spot

49:05.317 --> 49:07.277
and I'll gut you all over this
forest!

49:08.904 --> 49:11.490
(low zapping)

49:18.413 --> 49:19.581
- Great shot, Chip!

49:22.542 --> 49:24.211
- Hey, guys!

49:24.211 --> 49:25.754
There's a guy, he's hurt.

49:28.548 --> 49:29.508
So, you're alright?

49:30.842 --> 49:32.844
- Yeah, yeah I think so.

49:32.844 --> 49:33.804
- What's your name?

49:35.347 --> 49:36.181
- Eric, Eric.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.226
- So your gonna thank me, Eric?

49:41.186 --> 49:44.940
- Yeah, yeah, thank you for
picking me up.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.985
- No, for saving your life.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.319
- Saving my life?

49:49.319 --> 49:52.197
- Yeah, she was waking up.

49:52.197 --> 49:55.409
She was gonna kill ya.

49:55.409 --> 49:57.536
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.580
- You're welcome.

50:02.207 --> 50:03.625
- We must kill her.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.210
She's too dangerous to survive.

50:05.210 --> 50:06.044
- I know.

50:07.212 --> 50:08.296
Now go help your king.

50:09.172 --> 50:10.507
I'll be there in a minute.

50:11.842 --> 50:12.718
- [Tenan Voiceover] King?

50:12.718 --> 50:14.720
What king is she talking about?

50:14.720 --> 50:19.433
- When I kill you, I want you to
know it's me.

50:19.433 --> 50:21.601
Until then, Cayla.

50:21.601 --> 50:23.395
- [Tenan] Sophia!

50:23.395 --> 50:25.480
(tense music)

50:25.480 --> 50:28.859
(footsteps quickly rustling)

50:28.859 --> 50:31.069
(rustling)

50:34.948 --> 50:37.576
(inhales sharply)

50:37.576 --> 50:38.410
- Get off me!

50:40.412 --> 50:44.166
Take two of your men and head
that way.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.001
There are four of them.

50:46.001 --> 50:48.253
Bring me back the odd one.

50:50.088 --> 50:52.132
- Yes, Commander.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.301
You and you, come with me.

50:59.264 --> 51:03.977
- Commander, Lord Sil requests
you come home immediately.

51:03.977 --> 51:07.064
He's scheduled a meeting with
the committee.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.190
- Fine.

51:08.190 --> 51:09.566
Bring me my car.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.946
(ominous music)

52:13.964 --> 52:17.968
(whooshing)
(birds calling)

52:17.968 --> 52:20.804
(heavy footsteps)

52:57.632 --> 53:00.218
(chants words)

53:01.386 --> 53:04.014
(mysterious booming)

53:04.014 --> 53:05.599
- Come on, come on!

53:08.310 --> 53:10.896
(chants words)

53:14.191 --> 53:15.734
- [Man] Akinnis!

53:15.734 --> 53:16.568
Akinnis!

53:21.907 --> 53:25.243
- [Goon] Are you trying to
build a bridge to Earth?

53:26.578 --> 53:28.079
That's a myth, soldier!

53:29.122 --> 53:33.418
Those rebels filled your head
with talk of a sister planet.

53:33.418 --> 53:39.424
Akinnis, do what's right,
and vow your allegiance to Sil.

53:39.883 --> 53:43.803
- I am getting really tired of
seeing your ugly face, Goon!

53:47.390 --> 53:49.976
(battle music)

53:53.355 --> 53:55.523
(roaring)

54:00.362 --> 54:02.948
(chants words)

54:05.784 --> 54:10.497
- [Goon] Akinnis, you really
think this will stop you?

54:10.497 --> 54:12.832
(whooshing)

54:23.468 --> 54:26.179
(battle music)

54:26.179 --> 54:27.013
Argh!

54:42.487 --> 54:43.697
- Fucking Goon.

54:47.325 --> 54:49.536
(grunting)

54:52.706 --> 54:54.165
- [Goon] Akinnis!

54:55.709 --> 54:57.043
Give up already!

54:58.503 --> 55:01.548
Your band of rebels are all but
dead!

55:01.548 --> 55:03.049
Your race is dead.

55:04.342 --> 55:07.304
Sil is the true law of this
planet!

55:07.304 --> 55:09.597
Can't you see that?

55:09.597 --> 55:12.058
- Sil's days are numbered, the
royal four

55:12.058 --> 55:14.978
will return to put him down.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.439
- [Goon] You were once a
revered soldier of Merc,

55:18.481 --> 55:22.861
a legend of your race,
but look at you now.

55:22.861 --> 55:25.739
Running around, looking for
ghosts with a band of misfits.

55:28.199 --> 55:30.869
What would your dead family
think?

55:30.869 --> 55:32.078
(laughs)

55:32.078 --> 55:34.205
- Shut up and just die!

55:35.790 --> 55:38.376
(action music)

55:48.636 --> 55:50.889
(snapping)

56:03.818 --> 56:06.154
(whooshing)

56:07.906 --> 56:10.909
- [Creature] Shit, the children.

56:10.909 --> 56:12.577
- Go ahead, kill me!

56:13.912 --> 56:16.581
The kings will be found!

56:16.581 --> 56:18.333
And Sil will be done.

56:27.050 --> 56:29.636
(action music)

56:36.601 --> 56:39.104
(funky music)

57:17.851 --> 57:19.436
- Eric.

57:19.436 --> 57:20.645
Eric.

57:20.645 --> 57:21.563
Eric!

57:23.648 --> 57:25.483
- Yeah, I noticed that.

57:25.483 --> 57:26.985
Hey, you wanna hit that new bar

57:26.985 --> 57:28.820
around the corner after work?

57:28.820 --> 57:33.825
- Naw, I may just stay
home tonight and meditate.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.201
- Meditate?

57:35.201 --> 57:38.705
Look, Raquel's a bitch
bro, she played all of us.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.165
- Yeah maybe.

57:41.541 --> 57:43.585
- Yeah, you need to let her go.

57:43.585 --> 57:44.836
You need to meet me down to the
bar

57:44.836 --> 57:46.671
so we can find another Raquel.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.047
- Huh, what?

57:48.047 --> 57:49.799
- Yeah, I'm just saying.

57:55.555 --> 57:56.473
Damn!

57:59.392 --> 58:02.187
he is going to need a report
on each of these by the 16th.

58:02.187 --> 58:04.856
- The 16th, that only
leaves me 5 days, Monica,

58:04.856 --> 58:05.773
I don't know if--

58:05.773 --> 58:07.692
- Well you need to.

58:07.692 --> 58:10.653
If you have a problem with
it take it up with Mills.

58:10.653 --> 58:13.573
And you know what, that
means you will be fired.

58:13.573 --> 58:14.741
So pick your poison.

58:15.658 --> 58:18.161
- Yeah, yeah, I'll get on it,
it's fine.

58:20.038 --> 58:21.414
- Jimmy, would you mind?

58:21.414 --> 58:24.042
- You know Monika, your horns
are showing.

58:24.042 --> 58:24.959
- Eff you Jimmy!

58:27.795 --> 58:29.422
- That's one crazy bitch.

58:30.507 --> 58:34.636
Hey, five thirty, me, you,
women, new bar?

58:34.636 --> 58:36.262
- Man, you heard that demon.

58:36.262 --> 58:38.097
I gotta get this done by next
week

58:38.097 --> 58:40.391
and I need all the time that I
can get.

58:41.267 --> 58:46.231
- Look, you need to relax and
get laid before you explode.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.234
I'm gonna help you this weekend

58:49.234 --> 58:51.736
and get this project done, okay?

58:51.736 --> 58:53.571
- Come on Jimmy, seriously.

58:54.405 --> 58:56.074
Hey let me ask you something.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.868
Have you ever felt you were
meant for

58:58.868 --> 59:02.497
something larger in life, you
know, like something better

59:02.497 --> 59:04.332
than where we are now?

59:04.332 --> 59:06.584
- What, Eric what are you
talking about?

59:06.584 --> 59:08.670
- You know, like you
were meant for something

59:08.670 --> 59:11.005
more meaningful that can change
the world?

59:11.005 --> 59:13.341
- Eric are you smoking your
socks?

59:13.341 --> 59:14.425
- I'm serious Jimmy,

59:14.425 --> 59:18.429
I feel like something big
is coming my way real soon.

59:18.429 --> 59:20.765
- I hope so, boobs, in your
face.

59:20.765 --> 59:22.767
- I'm serious bro, I
don't know what it is,

59:22.767 --> 59:24.811
but something is coming.

59:25.853 --> 59:29.107
- All I know is, you need to get
laid.

59:29.107 --> 59:32.443
You need to meet me tonight, at
the bar,

59:34.028 --> 59:35.405
with the bitches.

59:49.127 --> 59:52.297
[Mysterious Voices] Help us,
hurry.

59:52.297 --> 59:54.382
Help us, hurry.

59:54.382 --> 59:56.801
- Jimmy, stop screwing around.

59:58.136 --> 1:00:02.181
- [Mysterious Voices] Come back,
help us.

1:00:02.181 --> 1:00:04.559
- Jimmy, you know what,
if you're out there.

1:00:07.395 --> 1:00:10.148
- [Mysterious Voices] Remember.

1:00:10.148 --> 1:00:10.982
- Jimmy?

1:00:12.483 --> 1:00:13.318
Anybody?

1:00:16.779 --> 1:00:18.489
I think I'll have those drinks
now.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:38.676
- Let's do a toast, hey, my man
Eric!

1:00:39.761 --> 1:00:41.387
- [Crowd] Eric!

1:00:41.387 --> 1:00:43.640
(cheering)

1:00:47.644 --> 1:00:50.772
- Hey Jimmy, hey everyone,
thank you, thank you.

1:00:50.772 --> 1:00:53.107
- Glad to see you're gonna
live a little bit, huh?

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:57.487
- Yeah yeah, I just needed
to take a break, that's all.

1:00:58.321 --> 1:01:02.033
- Look, Mills and watchdog,
don't worry about them, man,

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:04.035
we'll get you a job somewhere
else.

1:01:04.035 --> 1:01:05.745
- Yeah, true, I just
don't want to start over

1:01:05.745 --> 1:01:08.581
somewhere else with some new
assholes and new ass rules.

1:01:09.540 --> 1:01:12.210
- There's gonna be assholes
you're gonna deal with in life,

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:14.045
all the time, E.

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:16.506
Your job is not let them
get you in your heart.

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:20.343
- Yeah, thanks Jimmy,
you made sense for once.

1:01:20.343 --> 1:01:22.595
- Oh, you're trying to
be Mr Funny Man now, huh?

1:01:22.595 --> 1:01:23.429
- Hey Jim,

1:01:25.431 --> 1:01:27.600
buy me a drink Jimmy.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:28.726
- What's in it for me?

1:01:30.269 --> 1:01:31.813
- Think of something.

1:01:31.813 --> 1:01:33.398
- Slick, let me get another two.

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:48.037
(footsteps)

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:55.628
- Ahem.

1:01:56.838 --> 1:01:57.672
- Oh hi.

1:01:58.798 --> 1:01:59.674
- I'm Sofia.

1:02:02.009 --> 1:02:05.930
- Sofia, er, hi, I'm Eric, Eric
Wilson.

1:02:07.223 --> 1:02:08.391
- Go Eric!

1:02:12.145 --> 1:02:14.272
- Oh, I'm sorry, were you
sitting here?

1:02:14.272 --> 1:02:16.023
- I just saw you with your
friend.

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:18.943
He look like he'd rather buy
drinks

1:02:18.943 --> 1:02:20.445
than hang with hims friend.

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:23.448
- Well you have to get to know
Jimmy

1:02:23.448 --> 1:02:25.241
to understand that he's a good
guy.

1:02:27.285 --> 1:02:30.121
Oh, I'm sorry, would you like to
sit down?

1:02:30.121 --> 1:02:31.122
- [Sofia] Thank you.

1:02:34.959 --> 1:02:37.336
- Is everything all right, did
I spill something on my face,

1:02:37.336 --> 1:02:39.046
or did I spill something on
myself?

1:02:39.046 --> 1:02:40.798
- No, no you look good.
- Oh.

1:02:40.798 --> 1:02:44.427
- You just look familiar, that's
all.

1:02:44.427 --> 1:02:47.805
- So, erm, do you come here
often?

1:02:47.805 --> 1:02:50.224
Oh no no no, that was so
bad, I'm sorry, just, I'm.

1:02:50.224 --> 1:02:51.058
- Relax.

1:02:52.018 --> 1:02:54.103
(laughs)

1:03:00.067 --> 1:03:03.321
- And that's why got
punished for two weeks.

1:03:04.989 --> 1:03:08.951
- So I guess you played it
safe and became an analyst.

1:03:08.951 --> 1:03:10.661
- Yeah, I guess you could say
that.

1:03:11.871 --> 1:03:15.374
It pays the bills, but um,
can I ask you something?

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:18.169
No no, nevermind, forget it.

1:03:19.170 --> 1:03:21.088
- Too late, what is it?

1:03:21.964 --> 1:03:23.466
- Well,

1:03:23.466 --> 1:03:28.262
sometimes I feel that I'm
destined for bigger things,

1:03:28.262 --> 1:03:31.390
like something important
is going to happen

1:03:31.390 --> 1:03:36.395
and I can be free of
this everyday hum drum.

1:03:36.395 --> 1:03:39.023
I don't know, it' just crazy
talk, but.

1:03:39.023 --> 1:03:42.485
- Not at all, I believe that

1:03:42.485 --> 1:03:47.490
everyone was someone else
at one time or another

1:03:47.698 --> 1:03:51.536
in another life, if you
believe in that sort of things.

1:03:51.536 --> 1:03:54.413
- Actually, I do, I feel like
I'm built

1:03:54.413 --> 1:03:55.873
in a different day and age,

1:03:55.873 --> 1:03:57.875
you know like at a different
time,

1:03:57.875 --> 1:04:01.379
and I have the ability
to make a positive impact

1:04:01.379 --> 1:04:02.964
in people's lives.

1:04:02.964 --> 1:04:06.050
- Well, let's talk about
going somewhere different.

1:04:06.050 --> 1:04:08.427
- Sure, yeah, where would you
like to go?

1:04:10.054 --> 1:04:11.848
- I know this great lounge
across town

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:14.016
that makes great wings.

1:04:14.016 --> 1:04:16.936
- Wings and a lounge, sign me
up.

1:04:16.936 --> 1:04:18.479
- I'll get the cab.

1:04:18.479 --> 1:04:19.397
- And I'll be back.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:29.198
You got this Eric, you got this.

1:04:29.198 --> 1:04:30.741
Can't screw this up, all right.

1:04:30.741 --> 1:04:32.910
You're a man, you're a man.

1:04:34.912 --> 1:04:36.122
We can do this.

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:52.805
- I got it, crazy!

1:05:02.106 --> 1:05:04.901
- [Eric] So what's this
place called again?

1:05:04.901 --> 1:05:06.527
- [Sofia] I forget,

1:05:06.527 --> 1:05:09.989
but I already told the driver
where to go.

1:05:13.576 --> 1:05:15.786
(groaning)

1:05:17.246 --> 1:05:19.874
(birds calling)

1:05:37.850 --> 1:05:38.935
- Where am I?

1:05:39.769 --> 1:05:41.354
Where is everybody?

1:05:45.566 --> 1:05:46.400
Jimmy?

1:05:48.277 --> 1:05:49.111
Sofia?

1:06:35.366 --> 1:06:37.702
(screeching)

1:06:37.702 --> 1:06:39.203
What is that?

1:06:39.203 --> 1:06:41.372
(yelling)

1:06:44.291 --> 1:06:46.711
(leaves rustling)

1:06:46.711 --> 1:06:49.463
(sinister music)

1:07:01.726 --> 1:07:04.145
(screeching)

1:07:07.189 --> 1:07:09.066
Get away from me!

1:07:09.066 --> 1:07:10.026
Get off me!

1:07:31.839 --> 1:07:35.551
- [Figure] Come on, get up,
they'll be back soon, move!

1:07:35.551 --> 1:07:38.137
(action music)

1:08:36.904 --> 1:08:38.656
- Is it one of therm?

1:08:40.032 --> 1:08:40.866
- Yes.

1:08:42.159 --> 1:08:44.120
- Is it a king, or the queen?

1:08:45.788 --> 1:08:47.248
- King, perhaps.

1:08:49.542 --> 1:08:51.752
- Can you tell if he has
realized yet?

1:08:54.964 --> 1:08:57.675
- I don't believe he has
realized who he is, yet.

1:08:58.676 --> 1:09:01.595
This cloak over his location
I haven't felt before.

1:09:02.471 --> 1:09:06.142
- Sire, who is this king
you are concerned with?

1:09:08.769 --> 1:09:12.314
- Cayla, do you remember when
your father had you put away?

1:09:13.190 --> 1:09:14.483
For you own good, he said.

1:09:15.359 --> 1:09:20.364
Said your ways were, how did
he put it, unconventional.

1:09:20.698 --> 1:09:22.408
- [Cayla] Yes.

1:09:22.408 --> 1:09:23.909
- But you didn't believe that.

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:28.956
Slaughtering your entire
family was mighty cold.

1:09:28.956 --> 1:09:30.541
Overkill, perhaps.

1:09:31.959 --> 1:09:34.920
But you were simply
nourishing your true nature.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.964
The real Cayla was born that
night.

1:09:36.964 --> 1:09:40.509
- Yes, a glorious evening it
was.

1:09:41.802 --> 1:09:46.265
- This king wants to destroy
everything we've built

1:09:46.265 --> 1:09:49.185
and stand in the way of our
progress.

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:51.478
- Yes, sire, but,

1:09:51.478 --> 1:09:54.190
haven't we killed all
of the opposing kings?

1:09:54.190 --> 1:09:55.065
- Not this one.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:09:57.651
This is one returned.

1:09:59.236 --> 1:10:00.738
One of those who imprisoned
Yahzeel

1:10:00.738 --> 1:10:02.239
two thousand years ago.

1:10:03.782 --> 1:10:05.910
I just can't be sure which one
it is.

1:10:05.910 --> 1:10:07.119
- The legend?

1:10:07.119 --> 1:10:09.413
Of the queen and three kings.

1:10:10.247 --> 1:10:11.332
I thought that was a myth.

1:10:11.332 --> 1:10:15.002
- This is no myth, he is one of
them.

1:10:15.002 --> 1:10:16.670
And you need to make him go
away.

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:20.341
Go and make him a myth for me,

1:10:22.134 --> 1:10:23.427
and bring me back his head.

1:10:23.427 --> 1:10:25.596
- It would be a pleasure, sire,

1:10:25.596 --> 1:10:28.974
I can't wait to taste
the blood of an ancient.

1:10:28.974 --> 1:10:31.268
How would I identify him?

1:10:31.268 --> 1:10:32.853
- He will stand out.

1:10:32.853 --> 1:10:35.272
He'll be the one they all
protect.

1:10:35.272 --> 1:10:38.776
Go, be quick, he'll be a
bigger problem if he realizes.

1:10:47.451 --> 1:10:49.787
- Sil, the children,

1:10:51.288 --> 1:10:53.791
I feel they're in some sort of
pain.

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:55.668
That's impossible.

1:10:58.796 --> 1:11:02.007
with ancient magic, well the
ancient magic can affect them.

1:11:02.883 --> 1:11:05.010
So either his protector is well-
versed,

1:11:05.010 --> 1:11:07.554
or the ancient essence
running through his veins

1:11:07.554 --> 1:11:08.806
is enough to protect him.

1:11:09.765 --> 1:11:13.435
- Maybe not, maybe it was
the level of intensity

1:11:13.435 --> 1:11:16.647
and energy that we unleashed
in our last takeover.

1:11:16.647 --> 1:11:19.233
It could have made a rip between
worlds.

1:11:19.233 --> 1:11:20.651
- No, I would have felt it.

1:11:21.652 --> 1:11:23.779
I didn't feel it open this time.

1:11:25.656 --> 1:11:27.199
We gotta field this king.

1:11:29.868 --> 1:11:31.870
This is not good.

1:11:31.870 --> 1:11:35.416
- Sil, our time is here and now.

1:11:35.416 --> 1:11:38.419
We need to find and resurrect
Yahzeel immediately,

1:11:38.419 --> 1:11:41.839
and end this fear of kings and
queens.

1:11:42.756 --> 1:11:44.550
You are the only king.

1:11:45.384 --> 1:11:48.637
You are the only real king
Ressear needs.

1:11:50.222 --> 1:11:52.641
Everything is yours.

1:11:52.641 --> 1:11:54.893
One Cayla Find and kills that
creature,

1:11:54.893 --> 1:11:57.730
he will be a myth once more.

1:11:57.730 --> 1:12:00.357
Let's continue with the plan

1:12:00.357 --> 1:12:03.610
and become the god you are meant
to be.

1:12:03.610 --> 1:12:05.195
- You are something, aren't you?

1:12:06.196 --> 1:12:08.532
Prepare the plane for
home, we have much to do.

1:12:44.234 --> 1:12:46.362
(snarls)

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:57.331
- [Figure] Come, on come on,
move.

1:12:57.331 --> 1:12:59.500
(panting)

1:13:00.918 --> 1:13:02.753
Come on, come on.

1:13:02.753 --> 1:13:04.088
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:13:04.088 --> 1:13:06.173
(grunts)

1:13:08.175 --> 1:13:10.761
(chants words)

1:13:16.058 --> 1:13:18.310
(groaning)

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:23.774
(chants words)

1:13:26.443 --> 1:13:28.904
Look, look, look, I
have money int he bank,

1:13:28.904 --> 1:13:30.155
I can give you it, I promise,

1:13:30.155 --> 1:13:32.074
if you let me go I won't
say anything to anyone,

1:13:32.074 --> 1:13:32.908
I don't even know--

1:13:32.908 --> 1:13:33.784
- [Figure] Be quiet!

1:13:40.958 --> 1:13:43.043
Does anything look familiar to
you?

1:13:43.043 --> 1:13:45.212
- No, no, it doesn't.

1:13:53.887 --> 1:13:55.347
- Hello, Eric.

1:13:56.390 --> 1:13:57.224
- Sofia?

1:13:58.100 --> 1:13:59.268
Whoa re you?

1:13:59.268 --> 1:14:01.812
Why, why are you dressed liked
that?

1:14:01.812 --> 1:14:03.105
What the fuck is going on?

1:14:05.315 --> 1:14:10.070
- You are the beginning
piece of saving our planet.

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:11.655
- Saving our planet?

1:14:11.655 --> 1:14:13.991
Look, I don't know what
kind of drugs you're on,

1:14:13.991 --> 1:14:16.160
but I know a facility that
can help you with that--

1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:18.495
- Shut up, and listen to me!

1:14:19.496 --> 1:14:22.833
You need to remember who you
really are.

1:14:25.002 --> 1:14:28.130
Remember when you told me
about a feeling you had

1:14:28.130 --> 1:14:30.716
of being part of something
larger?

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:34.261
Something important,
something worth fighting for?

1:14:35.137 --> 1:14:38.432
Well that day is today.

1:14:42.352 --> 1:14:43.395
Welcome back, sire.

1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:46.648
- Sire?

1:14:46.648 --> 1:14:47.983
What?

1:14:47.983 --> 1:14:50.861
(mysterious music)
