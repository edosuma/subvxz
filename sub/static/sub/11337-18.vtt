WEBVTT

00:08.309 --> 00:10.042
Winnie?

00:10.044 --> 00:12.077
Winnie!

00:12.079 --> 00:13.579
Where were you?
Just making some copies.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.114
I need the briefing room.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.181
Team Three's prepping
a warrant.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.433
Tell them to brief
somewhere else.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.684
You let him get
the drop on you.
I let him get the...

00:18.686 --> 00:20.119
You should've...
I was covering you!

00:20.121 --> 00:21.320
Hey, hey, cool it!

00:21.321 --> 00:22.520
Winnie, those files come in?

00:22.523 --> 00:23.856
I'm working on it.
Winnie?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.190
I know, whatever it takes.
No talking to witness officers

00:25.191 --> 00:26.524
I heard you
the first time.
until you've made a save!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.144
Sam!
You were with him, man.

00:28.145 --> 00:29.762
Don't talk to
witness officers.
Sam, you gotta listen to me.

00:29.764 --> 00:30.763
Where you going, Sam?

00:30.765 --> 00:32.164
I'm gonna shower
and go home.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.532
We're not done here.
Maybe I am.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.768
We gotta debrief.
I got nothing to say.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.170
That's not an option.
Get in there now!

00:38.172 --> 00:40.239
You okay?
KOWALSKI: This is
the subject, Officer.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.607
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.275
I'm good.
Eddie, give the man
your statement.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.511
The rest of you, let's go!

00:45.513 --> 00:47.096
Thank you.

00:47.097 --> 00:48.680
Winnie, no one in there
until this is done.
Okay.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.349
Winnie, the files.
Yeah.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.517
Come on.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.518
(keypad beeps)

00:52.520 --> 00:54.420
(door slams shut)

01:00.795 --> 01:03.829
DEMOLITION EXPERT:
<i> The key's gonna be</i>
<i> bringing down the stands.</i>

01:03.831 --> 01:05.230
SUIT:
<i> Few sticks of dynamite.</i>

01:05.232 --> 01:07.132
You're gonna need
more than dynamite.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.368
Whatever, just get it
for next week.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.536
My guys can't do it next week.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.703
Then get new guys.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.238
I can't get new guys.
No one wants this job.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.607
Okay, I get it, I hear you.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.843
A building like this,
a heritage building.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.812
So beige, so square and...

01:19.814 --> 01:21.613
so much better
when my big glass tower

01:21.615 --> 01:24.216
is growing right
out of the middle.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.719
DEMOLITION EXPERT:
<i> Word of advice?</i>

01:27.721 --> 01:29.788
Might want to watch
what you say.
Why?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.857
This place is like a temple
to these guys.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.560
Morning.
Morning.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.262
Tell me again the last time
your guys made the finals.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.198
Refresh me.
That's not the point.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.399
Wasn't it half a century?

01:40.401 --> 01:43.302
42 years.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.737
Yeah, might be
time to move on.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.573
So...

01:47.574 --> 01:49.408
you're telling me
these stands are load bearing.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.311
(gunshot)
Hey!

01:52.313 --> 01:53.679
Help me, help me!

01:53.681 --> 01:56.148
(gunshots)
Get him out of here, come on!

02:00.121 --> 02:03.188
WINNIE (over radio):
<i> Hot call, shots fired,</i>
<i> Godwin Coliseum.</i>

02:03.190 --> 02:06.391
(sirens blaring)

02:25.146 --> 02:26.645
(cocking gun)

02:35.256 --> 02:36.889
PARKER:
We got it, buddy, thanks.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.390
How you doing?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.225
I've been better.
You were in there?

02:40.227 --> 02:41.727
Yeah, I'm the, uh,
demolitions supervisor.

02:41.729 --> 02:44.229
You get a visual
on the shooter?
No, but we weren't

02:44.231 --> 02:46.431
looking around;
we got out of there fast.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.167
You get a sense of what
direction the shots came from?

02:48.169 --> 02:49.352
No. The place is huge.

02:49.353 --> 02:50.536
A lot of concrete, echoes,
and like I said,

02:50.538 --> 02:52.371
You were getting shot at,

02:52.373 --> 02:54.373
you weren't thinking detail,
I get it.
No, I'm sorry.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.774
Those the, uh, the
blueprints to the Arena?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.242
Yeah.
Do you mind?

02:57.244 --> 02:58.877
All right, see you later.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.579
SUIT:
<i> This is a frickin' nightmare!</i>

03:00.580 --> 03:02.280
I understand, sir,
getting shot...
How long's it gonna take

03:02.283 --> 03:04.283
If you can tell us...
you to nail this guy?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.918
I need to get
my men in there.
Sir, we're asking you again,

03:05.920 --> 03:06.919
are you sure you can't
recall any detail,

03:06.921 --> 03:08.654
where the shots came from?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.222
I didn't see anyone, all right?
Why don't you get in there

03:10.224 --> 03:12.257
and put my tax dollars
to work?
May I?

03:12.259 --> 03:13.458
Absolutely.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.893
What the hell are you doing?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.728
What you can't tell us,
your wound will.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.297
Ow, damn it!

03:18.299 --> 03:20.265
Small bore, downwards strafe.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.333
Shot came from
somewhere high.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.635
Which way were you facing?
What?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.237
Relative to the front door,
which way were you facing?

03:25.239 --> 03:28.740
That way.
Okay, so, west.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.943
So the shots came from
around here somewhere.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.277
Yep.
Thank you, sir.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.378
Best wishes
for a speedy recovery.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.216
WORDY:
I've got uniforms
on every door.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.417
Nobody's been in or out.

03:38.419 --> 03:39.484
The guy's likely in there.

03:39.486 --> 03:40.686
Could be more than one guy.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.221
So, everybody else is
out of the building?

03:42.223 --> 03:43.622
Security company says so.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.957
There's one guard
unaccounted for

03:44.959 --> 03:47.492
but he's on end of shift,
probably gone home.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.560
They're trying to confirm.
All right, good.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.728
Let's keep it contained.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.363
Jules?
Copy that.

03:51.364 --> 03:52.997
I'm gonna find you a place
to Command Post inside.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.333
Copy.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.534
Eddie?

04:05.246 --> 04:08.947
April 2nd, 1957.
You know who played here?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.649
Memphis Flash.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.718
Boss, focus.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.786
The King!

04:34.308 --> 04:37.009
Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.644
Infrared sensor.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.000
(gunshot)

05:04.638 --> 05:06.571
Everyone's good?
Good.
Good, no harm.

05:10.044 --> 05:13.445
(three gunshots)

05:14.548 --> 05:16.048
Same impact point, each shot.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.649
It's rigged to go when
someone walks across it.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.452
It's out of ammo.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.821
Clever.
Yeah, takes a bit of know-how.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.723
That matches the angle
of the bullet wound.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.792
That rifle's somewhere
in the northeast.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.393
I'm guessing somewhere
in the blues.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.728
Okay, you and Leah,
check it out.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.963
Low and slow.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.736
So, no shooter.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.738
But we got a booby trap.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.073
Which means we may have more.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.909
Sarge, there's a secure room,
east entrance.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.377
Some kind of VIP lounge.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.079
Copy that,
we'll Command Post there.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.948
The Stoves Club Lounge.
Players and brass only.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.684
I always dreamed
of getting in there.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.861
Pretty open.
Yeah.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.400
The gun's right there.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.468
Ready?
Yeah.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.505
Cover me.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.153
Jules, I got a serial number.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.055
Great, I'll run it
through the registry.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.059
Everything you dreamed
it was, Wordy?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.794
You can still smell the cigars.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.096
All right, we got a lot
of ground to cover.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.931
Boss, what are you
thinking profile-wise?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.834
Lots of people not happy
to see this place go.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.404
So, what, you shoot somebody
over a building?

06:45.406 --> 06:47.673
It's not just a building.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.941
Besides Elvis in '57,
you got Winston Churchill,

06:49.943 --> 06:53.044
the Beatles three times,
70 years of pro-hockey,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.046
people met here,
people married here...

06:55.048 --> 06:56.148
Right, a big emotional
investment.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.849
A lot of motives.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.851
So, who's pushed far enough
to do something about it?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.420
All right, I gotta get
inside of that rink.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.988
If he's set more traps,
that's where they're gonna be.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.456
Where the heart beats.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.724
Go careful, Eddie.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.892
Okay, Wordy, grab the ball cam.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.794
ED:
Sam, Leah, how's your vantage?

07:08.796 --> 07:11.496
About 80 percent.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.433
We're almost blind
on the north side.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.700
Sarge, I got a hit on the rifle.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.970
Belongs to a Max Dykstra,
downtown address.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.483
Okay, let's send some
uni's over there.

07:20.484 --> 07:21.995
I got a guy there
on the way now,

07:21.996 --> 07:23.507
I'm gonna try and get some
more background on this guy.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.710
You got anything on him
besides the address?

07:25.712 --> 07:28.447
No record, but he's a
retired hockey player.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.216
One year pro, 1978.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.984
That's good news, Jules.
Eddie, we may have

07:32.986 --> 07:35.954
a line on the subject.
Copy that. Wordy?

07:37.925 --> 07:40.492
Let's see if he's left us
any more surprises.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.744
This place is massive.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.480
Lots of shadows.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.588
Okay, clear.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.090
Let's move in a foot at a time.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.926
We're looking for laser,

08:14.928 --> 08:16.895
trip mechanisms, wires.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.005
(gunshots)

08:27.007 --> 08:28.773
Back, back, back!

08:28.775 --> 08:30.809
(gunfire)

08:30.811 --> 08:32.143
Eddie, talk to me.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.145
I'm good. Wordy?
Uh-huh, no harm.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.014
That's live fire.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.617
We got an active shooter.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.152
He's here.

08:42.122 --> 08:46.191
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:19.059 --> 09:20.892
Those are targeted shots?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.727
He's here.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.030
He's watching.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.631
Sam, Leah, what do you got?

09:26.633 --> 09:28.266
SAM:
Ricochet mark on the south end.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.001
Could be above us,
could be below us.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.303
Didn't see any muzzle flash.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.271
He's in our blind spot.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.973
SPIKE:
Okay, could be the catwalk,
could be the gondola,

09:34.975 --> 09:36.875
could be the grey seats,
it could be the greens.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.776
PARKER:
Okay, we don't see
anything on the cam.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.245
We gotta regroup and contain,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.147
take this piece by piece.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.281
JULES:
Sarge, the owner of the rifle.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.583
PARKER:
Yeah, Jules, what?

09:44.585 --> 09:45.684
He was at home.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.252
Then who's firing on my team?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.921
It's his hunting rifle; he says
someone must have stolen it.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.089
Claims not to know
that it was missing.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.991
And you believe him?

09:52.993 --> 09:55.093
Ex hockey-player,
hockey coach.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.661
His rifle goes missing?

09:56.663 --> 09:57.929
You know what we call that
in the police business?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.598
"Hinky"?
Hinky!

09:59.600 --> 10:01.933
Interrogate him.
Uniforms are bringing him in.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.170
MAN (voice echoing over P.A.):
Your unit is trespassing.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.771
Leave the building immediately.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.008
I repeat, you are trespassing.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.111
Leave right now.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.182
Okay, the wires run
into the Press Gondola.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.683
It's gotta be
the announcer booth,

10:18.685 --> 10:19.985
northeast corner.
Okay.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.152
Eddie, we're going up there.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.654
Ed, you can get at it
from the south,

10:22.656 --> 10:23.955
but you gotta be careful, okay?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.390
It's a long corridor,
and it's exposed.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.891
Copy that. On our way.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.627
ED: Sam?
SAM: We can cover you;

10:28.629 --> 10:30.295
he still might be in there.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.705
(sighs)
Ready?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.008
Yeah. Clear.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.643
Ed, you at
the door yet?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.811
Door's closed.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.246
Sam, keep this
hallway covered.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.888
Clear.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.326
Ready.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.072
This guy wants to talk,
let's talk.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.940
This is Sergeant Greg Parker
with the Police...

11:15.942 --> 11:17.108
SPIKE:
Hold on.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.927
He's cut the wires.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.745
Boss, I don't think
he wants to talk.
All right.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.980
Who the hell is this guy?

11:21.982 --> 11:23.381
Thoughts?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.684
Young voice.
Sounds under 30.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.951
He mentioned the word unit.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.386
Maybe there's
a military connection.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.989
Or he knows we're the
Strategic Response Unit.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.090
WORDY:
I.R.'s a pretty

11:32.092 --> 11:33.925
sophisticated device
for a civilian.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.227
Okay, Jules, let's look into
any recently returned vets.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.262
That's a pretty wide net.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.329
Cross-reference guys with

11:38.331 --> 11:39.698
criminal records.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.399
(phone ringing)
Boss, are you calling me?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.068
What? No.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.404
Yeah?

11:46.406 --> 11:47.405
MAN (on phone):
Why are you still here?

11:47.407 --> 11:48.406
I'm glad
you called.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.774
It's Ed Lane from...

11:49.776 --> 11:51.009
Get your unit out of here.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.111
That was him.
Where'd you leave your phone?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.746
On the table at Command Post.

11:54.748 --> 11:55.980
You're sure?
Yes, I'm sure!

11:55.982 --> 11:58.016
There's only one way in there.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.751
And we left uniforms
on the doors.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.352
ED:
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's move it!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.393
Officer, has
anyone walked

12:08.395 --> 12:10.028
through that door
in the past five minutes?

12:10.030 --> 12:11.763
No, sir.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.497
What's this guy,
walk through walls?

12:13.500 --> 12:14.766
Stack it up.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.768
Go.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.079
Ready?
Yup.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.089
Sam?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.458
Boss, give me a hand.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.162
He may have left us
a heat print.

12:53.940 --> 12:58.009
He touched the wall right there.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.780
(whispers):
Straight ahead.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.359
Down the rabbit hole.
ED:
Spike?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.861
No rabbit hole on
the floor plans.
PARKER:
All right.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.164
He's got the upper hand.
He knows this place inside out.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.232
All right, we're gonna need
more intel, or he's gonna spend

13:21.234 --> 13:22.934
the afternoon using this place
as a shooting gallery.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.437
WORDY:
When I was a kid,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.939
the ushers used to tell us
about hidden rooms and passages.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.891
Mostly retired guys.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.842
Took the job so they could
see the games for free.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.578
If anybody'd know,
it'd be them.
Jules?

13:33.580 --> 13:35.246
I'll find someone.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.248
We should follow his trail
before it cools.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.117
It's a confined space.
We don't know where it goes.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.235
Yeah, but it's either that,

13:40.236 --> 13:41.352
or we sit around
waiting for Grampa

13:41.354 --> 13:43.154
to show us
to our seats.
I'll go with him.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.889
All right. No unnecessary risks.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.291
And strict noise discipline.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.229
(door squeaks open)

13:54.501 --> 13:56.267
(beeping)

14:09.182 --> 14:10.448
Spike,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.283
I got a door on the left.
Anything?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.618
You're still off the grid.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.561
"Deny, defeat and rise..."

14:23.563 --> 14:26.130
WORDY:
"Deny defeat and rise
on victory's wings."

14:26.132 --> 14:27.298
That's the dressing room.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.266
Oh, I've got goosebumps.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.034
I'm not even a hockey fan.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.370
(exploding)

14:32.372 --> 14:34.239
Fall back! Go! Go! Go!

14:34.241 --> 14:36.074
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Sam, Leah,
status.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.208
Sam, talk to me!

14:37.210 --> 14:38.209
Status! Status!

14:38.211 --> 14:39.210
No! No! Don't let it touch you!

14:43.416 --> 14:45.316
Move! Move! Move! Water!

14:45.318 --> 14:47.585
Get the water. Let's
get the water now.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.287
(overlapping shouting)

14:49.289 --> 14:51.422
Over here!
(overlapping shouting)

14:51.424 --> 14:52.523
Wordy! Wordy!

14:52.525 --> 14:53.524
Come on!

14:53.526 --> 14:54.993
Come on now!
Bring it now!

14:54.995 --> 14:56.394
Put it in now!

14:56.396 --> 14:58.396
(sighs)

14:59.366 --> 15:02.000
I got to get this off.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.234
What the hell is it?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.136
Phosphorous.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.138
Who gets their hands
on phosphorous?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.140
A lot of stuff you can
get on the black market,

15:09.142 --> 15:10.008
but white phosphorous?

15:10.010 --> 15:11.009
Afghanistan. Leftovers

15:11.011 --> 15:12.043
from the war with the Russians.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.261
So this guy is military.

15:13.262 --> 15:14.478
Didn't break the skin.
You're gonna be okay.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.080
PARKER:
And if it had?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.535
It would have gone
in the bloodstream.

15:17.536 --> 15:18.989
It would have damaged
his organs.
Son of a bitch.

15:18.990 --> 15:20.443
JULES:
Winnie cross-referenced

15:20.444 --> 15:21.897
recent vets
with criminal records.

15:21.898 --> 15:23.351
I have 37 names.
ED:
We need a shorter short list.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.924
They let guys with records
enter the military?
No.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.191
They get their records
after they come home.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.593
JULES:
Domestic disturbance,

15:28.595 --> 15:32.196
assaults, DUI, possession
of controlled substances...

15:32.198 --> 15:33.698
PARKER:
It's about recklessness
and aggression,

15:33.700 --> 15:35.884
and a lack of impulse control.

15:35.885 --> 15:38.069
Trying to feel something
again, or not feel something.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.071
Okay.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.540
Jules, one of those 37
vets might be taking this

15:42.542 --> 15:43.708
personally.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.009
I'm looking for a connection.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.178
Sergeant Parker?

15:47.180 --> 15:48.279
Yeah.
You sent for...

15:48.281 --> 15:49.280
Charlie Howard.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.015
I used to be

15:51.017 --> 15:52.050
an usher here '77 to '98.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.217
Hey, Charlie.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.986
Sergeant Parker, SRU.
Thanks for coming.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.121
Sergeant Parker, can I
get something straight?

15:57.123 --> 15:59.123
Uh, somebody's trying
to stop this demolition,

15:59.125 --> 16:02.293
and you want me to
help you stop him?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.728
Yeah, we hear you, Charlie,

16:03.730 --> 16:05.663
but it's his methods
that we're not happy about.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.031
His methods, Charlie--
live fire,

16:07.033 --> 16:08.700
chemical assault
against my team.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.068
Okay, I got you.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.036
PARKER:
And he's a step ahead of us

16:12.038 --> 16:14.238
because he knows every inch
of this place.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.406
You mean,
he's been squatting here?

16:15.408 --> 16:16.641
That's a fair assumption.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.042
Wow.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.344
Maybe he found the bunker.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.745
The bunker?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.114
Daniel Godwin's secret
apartment. I only saw it once.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.116
I mean, the man
liked his privacy.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.552
Can you show us
where it is?
Well, no. Hey,
not on any map.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.555
Like I said, I only saw
it once, and that was...

16:30.557 --> 16:32.557
Wow. Toronto versus
Pittsburgh. '87.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.092
Let me guess. We lost?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.644
Hey!
Sorry.

16:35.645 --> 16:37.195
All right, Charlie this is
important here, okay?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.813
Do you remember where?

16:38.814 --> 16:40.430
I just remembered
it was near a concession stand.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.333
There's 24 concession stands.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.534
Well, let's get out there.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.269
You know, the old muscle
memory'll kick in.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.437
No, it's too risky, Charlie.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.605
Look, I got to be on my feet.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.773
All right, trust me--
I'll know it

16:48.775 --> 16:50.174
when I feel it.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.443
All right, we take him
in diamond formation

16:52.445 --> 16:54.112
through the concession stands.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.079
They got great
visibility.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.247
He'll be safe.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.648
Okay.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.218
Wordy, Leah,
Sam, let's go.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.753
Hey, let me try him
on the cell phone.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.121
Maybe he'll talk to me.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.355
You okay
if I keep Sam?
Spike?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.224
Yeah.
All right, Charlie,

17:06.226 --> 17:07.792
let's get you dressed.
Guys, let's go.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.263
Hey, Jules, I'm sending a text
to the boss's phone.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.297
This guy picks up,
are you gonna be able

17:13.299 --> 17:14.298
to patch it into the headset?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.366
No problem.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.771
Okay.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.553
(phone rings)

17:41.461 --> 17:42.760
(laughs)

17:42.762 --> 17:46.264
(beeping tones)

17:46.266 --> 17:47.598
(text alert tone)

17:47.600 --> 17:49.233
(phone rings)

17:59.245 --> 18:00.211
Charlie?

18:00.213 --> 18:01.479
No.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.148
I know there was a sign,
but that's not it.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.754
(phone ringing)

18:09.756 --> 18:11.255
(text alert tone)

18:11.257 --> 18:12.757
Braddock.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.292
AKA Badass Junior.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.327
That's right.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.795
What do I get to call you?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.363
What are you doing in my A.O.?

18:19.365 --> 18:20.431
Oh, just keeping the peace.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.532
Braddock,

18:21.534 --> 18:22.867
I need you to un-ass this area.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.602
Copy that.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.336
I just need to know
that everything's gonna be okay.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.305
(whispers):
Hockey connection.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.473
I'm not gonna say it again.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.807
I'm just glad to be back
in this place again.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.876
I haven't been here
since the '94 playoffs.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.244
Chicago, game five.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.246
You see that game?

18:35.248 --> 18:38.816
I would have frickin' killed
to see that game.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.451
But I had a tournament
in Hamilton.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.619
Get out of here.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.689
You must have been,
what, Bantam, Peewee?

18:44.691 --> 18:46.724
Atom.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.127
I didn't have a choice.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.261
Team needed me.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.263
SAM:
So, how'd it
go in Hamilton?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.464
Was the best we ever played.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.499
Really?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.234
Had to make it worthwhile,
right?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.480
Mr. Dykstra?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.715
Have a seat.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.883
What the hell's going on?

19:11.885 --> 19:13.401
My rifle gets stolen,

19:13.402 --> 19:14.918
and I'm the one getting
the criminal treatment?

19:14.921 --> 19:17.255
Why didn't you report
the theft?
I didn't know

19:17.257 --> 19:18.756
there was a theft
until you called.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.324
So somebody broke
into your garage,

19:20.326 --> 19:22.160
went straight
for a concealed rifle,

19:22.162 --> 19:23.427
didn't touch
anything else?

19:23.429 --> 19:24.595
That's right.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.897
Or you gave it to someone.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.698
I didn't give it to anyone.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.867
Then who knows where
you keep your locked rifle?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.502
Why are you assuming
that the...?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.570
Because you're
a hockey coach,

19:32.572 --> 19:34.205
and this is a hockey arena.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.240
And I'm not convinced
that this is a coincidence.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.875
I wish I could help you.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.311
Well, you're not
leaving until you do.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.479
What position did you play?

19:41.481 --> 19:42.713
MAN:
All of them.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.881
Really?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.917
Oh, Coach made us cross-train.

19:45.919 --> 19:49.420
Had to think each position,
cover

19:49.422 --> 19:50.655
for anyone.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.790
Sounds like my unit.

19:54.928 --> 19:57.595
So why this place?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.530
This place?

20:01.367 --> 20:03.434
(sighs)

20:06.539 --> 20:08.739
This is where anything
that ever mattered happens.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.741
JULES:
<i> All right, let's talk</i>

20:10.743 --> 20:13.344
about the divisional finals
in Hamilton, 1994.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.979
Who was on that team?

20:14.981 --> 20:18.216
I have 37
names of men

20:18.218 --> 20:19.850
who just came back from
military services overseas

20:19.852 --> 20:21.219
who had a rocky landing.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.271
It's gonna take me
about ten minutes

20:23.272 --> 20:25.322
to get the names
of the guys on the
teams you've coached,

20:25.325 --> 20:27.358
about three seconds
to narrow that down

20:27.360 --> 20:29.293
to one name in common.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.362
(sighs)

20:32.498 --> 20:34.765
Look, there's a young man
in there,

20:34.767 --> 20:37.468
and you know him.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.804
And I'm guessing
you care about him.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.540
If you don't help
me right now...

20:42.542 --> 20:43.874
Darren Kovacs.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.476
Thank you.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.344
Subject's name

20:46.346 --> 20:47.511
is Darren Kovacs.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.780
Thanks, Jules. Winnie,

20:49.782 --> 20:52.717
find me family
for Darren Kovacs.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.285
Copy that.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.920
JULES:
See if you can get
military records, too.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.455
Those could be classified.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.290
Pull strings.
Whatever it takes, Winnie.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.358
Got it.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.393
First time
I saw him play

21:02.395 --> 21:03.527
was right here at the Coliseum.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.363
It was a novice league
fundraiser.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.764
He blew everyone away.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.333
He was eight.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.335
You know, when you're here,

21:11.337 --> 21:13.437
you know what you're for.

21:13.439 --> 21:17.375
If you're on the stands
or you're on the ice,

21:17.377 --> 21:18.876
you know what you're for.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.878
You feel like belong,
I hear you.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.513
MAX:
<i> I took him under my wing,</i>

21:22.515 --> 21:24.649
helped him up the ladder.
I mean, he-he was this close

21:24.651 --> 21:26.050
to turning pro.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.202
What happened?

21:28.203 --> 21:30.353
He comes to me one day, and he
tells me he wants to go serve

21:30.356 --> 21:32.390
on another team for a while.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.459
You know you can count
on your team, you know.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.962
Through all the...

21:37.964 --> 21:40.965
the blood, the sweat, the crap.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.367
That was a promise.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.069
MAX:
<i> Broke my heart to see him go.</i>

21:45.071 --> 21:46.537
And-and not just
cause of the hockey.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.572
You spend so many hours
together.

21:48.574 --> 21:51.575
He was such a damn good kid.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.578
He told me he'd come back.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.647
He came back.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.417
Most of him.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.420
When things got bad
over there...

22:02.422 --> 22:05.656
I had one thing
that I could hold on to:

22:05.658 --> 22:08.793
I knew I'd be back here one day.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.763
Back at the Godwin Coliseum.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.633
Center ice.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.676
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.678
"Server Uniforms."

22:27.680 --> 22:30.047
This is it.
I'm sure it's in there.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.426
All right, we got a 20
on the bunker.

22:42.428 --> 22:43.728
Let's get a uniform up here.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.430
Send Charlie back
through a secured passage.

22:46.432 --> 22:49.500
He sat in my living room
there last week.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.503
It was-- it was the first time
I saw him since he got back.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.138
I barely recognized him.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.140
And I get back here...

22:56.142 --> 22:58.476
and they're tearing it down?

22:59.579 --> 23:01.645
I lived through all that.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.049
And for what?

23:05.051 --> 23:07.051
Right?

23:07.053 --> 23:09.787
The "Lifestyle Condos"
and a parking lot?

23:09.789 --> 23:11.122
He sat there.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.041
He was empty.

23:13.042 --> 23:14.959
It-it was like his mind
was somewhere else.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.961
Like he was sleepwalking.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.963
What happened to him over there?

23:18.965 --> 23:21.031
Never told me.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.069
(picking lock)

23:26.606 --> 23:28.439
SAM:
Condos and a parking lot.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.175
Just what downtown
needs more of, right?

23:34.447 --> 23:35.646
(door unlocks)

23:57.737 --> 24:00.638
Pictures from
the front.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.440
Looks like his unit.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.608
Sending a picture.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.546
(computer chimes)

24:08.548 --> 24:10.581
SPIKE:
"Syotos." Sam?

24:10.583 --> 24:11.682
No.

24:11.684 --> 24:12.950
He doesn't know, Spike.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.018
Darren?

24:14.020 --> 24:15.820
You there still?

24:15.822 --> 24:17.621
Darren?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.623
You guys must be close.
He's not talking.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.858
Hey, guys, guys.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.092
(whispering):
Gotta go.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.194
He's on the move.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.870
On three.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.104
One, two, three.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.173
Darren Kovacs!

24:47.186 --> 24:48.719
ALL:
Down! Down! Down!

24:59.131 --> 25:00.498
Eddie?
ED (over radio):
Flashbang.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.900
In pursuit.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.969
SAM: I'm on my way.
ED (over radio):
Sam, lower concessions.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.871
He's gone down the escalators.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.706
(gunshots)

25:20.286 --> 25:21.986
Anything?

25:21.988 --> 25:23.153
No joy.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.892
He cut the power.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.293
Sarge, I've got Darren's father

25:29.295 --> 25:31.662
on the line.
Copy that, Jules.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.830
Eddie?
I'm not going in blind

25:32.832 --> 25:34.265
so he can shoot at us again.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.267
We get the power on,
we go in after him.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.535
Ed.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.169
Ed, he's been
shooting to miss.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.038
You don't know that.
He's injured two people today,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
Sam, and you're one
of them was you.
That wasn't personalized.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.675
SAM: Now it is.
Sam...?

25:44.677 --> 25:45.876
I've got a connection, boss.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.045
I know where this guy's
coming from.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.681
First solution's
to talk, right?

25:50.683 --> 25:52.116
You be objective?

25:52.118 --> 25:53.651
I've been SRU over a year.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.085
I think I know
how it works.
PARKER: Okay, Ed.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.288
Ed, dig in, take cover.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.322
Let's do what we do.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.957
Let's talk him out. Sam?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.091
Yeah, boss?

26:01.093 --> 26:02.159
I'm letting you do this.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.029
Thanks, boss.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.931
And he's not been getting
any professional help?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.866
Ah, asking for help's
not his thing.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.868
Sounds like your son, um,

26:10.870 --> 26:13.771
grew up with a lot of
expectations around him.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.239
Yeah, but it never
went to his head.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.041
Darren was always just--

26:17.043 --> 26:19.343
he always afraid
to disappoint the people

26:19.345 --> 26:20.744
who believed in him.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.313
That-that's why
he worked so hard.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.882
And then when he came back home?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.834
He just cut himself off.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.785
Started-- you know,
he wouldn't talk to anybody,

26:28.788 --> 26:32.356
started hitting the drink and
picking fights with strangers.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.925
Did he ever tell you why?

26:34.927 --> 26:37.227
Hang on. I'm nearly here.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.029
(dialing)

26:39.031 --> 26:40.631
(phone line ringing)

26:40.633 --> 26:42.266
Braddock?

26:42.268 --> 26:43.801
SAM:
Darren.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.936
Where did you get my name?

26:45.938 --> 26:48.238
That's, uh, that's our M.O.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.774
We like to know
who we're talking to.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.877
I was in the forces for a couple
of years when I was young.

26:53.879 --> 26:55.245
And so was my Dad.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.014
I mean, that's-that's what
you're supposed to do.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.215
You serve your country.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.217
But when Darren told me

27:00.219 --> 27:02.853
that he wanted
to take his turn...

27:02.855 --> 27:04.455
I wasn't happy.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.056
It was a bright future
he was putting on hold.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.058
I knew it.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.094
It killed me to see him do that.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.162
But I always told my son,

27:12.164 --> 27:14.198
"You make your choices."

27:14.200 --> 27:17.001
So, I-I couldn't
stand in his way.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.036
Where was he deployed?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.904
Kandahar.
(typing)

27:20.906 --> 27:22.406
(computer beeps)
Hey.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.275
You found his-his
musketeers.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.944
Hey...

27:26.946 --> 27:28.846
It's Howie Carson.
His right-winger.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.383
Yeah, little Howie
and Jordan and Pete.

27:32.385 --> 27:34.385
Those guys--

27:34.387 --> 27:36.820
they meant everything to him.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.890
What happened in Kandahar?

27:41.027 --> 27:43.761
Well...

27:43.763 --> 27:45.829
he lost them.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.366
DARREN:
<i> Yeah?</i>

27:49.368 --> 27:51.402
And what else do you know?

27:51.404 --> 27:54.104
I know what it was
like over there.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.974
You know your war.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.009
You don't know mine.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.377
I know.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.812
Everyone's is different.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.414
JULES:
Sam. Darren lost

28:03.415 --> 28:05.015
his three closest friends
on a patrol near Kandahar.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.150
IED took them out,

28:06.152 --> 28:08.452
and he walked away
without a scratch.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.721
Copy that.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.291
You want to know
what my war was, Kovacs?

28:14.293 --> 28:17.027
I'm a long-distance marksman.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.028
Sniper?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.030
Yeah.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.032
And I served with a friend, too.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.734
Close friend.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.202
Ben.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.172
He didn't make it.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.807
When I found him,

28:29.809 --> 28:31.875
he'd been hit with a 50 cal.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.779
There was nothing of him left.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.915
Sam, what's your game plan here?

28:37.917 --> 28:41.151
He has to know I understand.
PARKER: I get that.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.187
He has to hear
that he's not alone.
PARKER: Okay.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.189
You don't have
to push too hard.
SAM: Boss, trust me on this.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.724
This is one I can do.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.492
Kovacs. Is that Hungarian?

28:48.494 --> 28:50.027
Yeah.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.995
"Syotos" mean anything?

28:55.134 --> 28:56.300
No.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.035
DARREN:
Me and my guys,

28:58.037 --> 29:00.070
we went everywhere together.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.940
All for one.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.109
But that night,

29:05.111 --> 29:06.810
I was thirsty.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.113
So, I, uh, slowed down to go

29:09.115 --> 29:11.081
for my canteen.

29:11.083 --> 29:15.052
They were 20 paces ahead
when the bomb went off.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.354
Darren, you didn't plant
that IED.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.156
If it hadn't been for me?

29:19.158 --> 29:22.226
Howie never would
have signed up.

29:24.964 --> 29:27.397
He did it for me.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.450
(sniffles)

29:29.451 --> 29:31.502
And now I have his blood
on my hands.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.940
And you don't know
what that's like.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.345
Yeah, I do.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.482
And the shot that took out Ben?

29:45.484 --> 29:48.552
That was-- that was me.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.122
I was given the order.
I was cleared to fire.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.425
And I... I took the shot.

29:55.427 --> 29:59.129
Ben was in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

29:59.131 --> 30:00.864
and I killed my best friend

30:00.866 --> 30:03.167
from two kilometers away.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.235
I killed him.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.373
I... I thought
I was gonna go crazy,

30:09.375 --> 30:11.875
but I got through it.

30:13.879 --> 30:16.880
You have a place in your mind
that you go to

30:16.882 --> 30:19.917
when you can't take it anymore.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.118
(sighs)

30:21.120 --> 30:23.320
When you think you're gonna die?

30:23.322 --> 30:24.855
(sniffles)

30:24.857 --> 30:26.123
And you're thinking
you'd rather be dead

30:26.125 --> 30:28.158
than be where you are.
Yeah.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.160
Now, for us-- me and Howie--

30:30.162 --> 30:31.895
(sighs heavily)

30:31.897 --> 30:33.964
...this was it.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.000
(sniffles)

30:37.001 --> 30:39.101
We knew if we could just
make it back, you know.

30:42.107 --> 30:45.242
We'd close our eyes, and...

30:45.244 --> 30:47.277
we'd imagine ourselves back here

30:47.279 --> 30:49.947
at center ice.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.420
(sniffles)

30:56.422 --> 30:59.489
Now they're gone.
(sniffles)

30:59.491 --> 31:01.558
Howie's gone.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.965
They're not going to
let me back in there.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.567
And I got nothing here.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.537
I got nothing to see me through.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.305
I thought it was over

31:15.307 --> 31:17.374
for me too, Darren.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.311
I know, okay?

31:21.313 --> 31:23.347
I know.

31:23.349 --> 31:26.383
But I found a different place
to go, a different person to be.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.252
That's why I'm here,

31:28.254 --> 31:30.020
so let me help you.

31:30.022 --> 31:33.023
What was your first name again,

31:33.025 --> 31:35.025
Braddock?

31:35.027 --> 31:37.160
It's Sam.

31:37.162 --> 31:39.229
(crying)

31:43.502 --> 31:45.535
I'm tired, Sam.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.537
Then let's get some rest.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.439
Let's do this together.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.943
Okay.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.011
Nicely done, Sam.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.445
All right, let's bring it home.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.916
Now, Darren,
I need you to...

31:58.918 --> 32:00.450
I need you to put
down your gun.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.085
(uncocks gun)

32:02.087 --> 32:04.054
Okay, I will.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.555
And I need you to come down
to the bottom

32:05.557 --> 32:07.057
of the escalator's
concession area.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.059
No.

32:09.061 --> 32:12.296
Darren...
Center ice.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.530
And it has to be you.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.698
Too exposed.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.233
Darren, I can't.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.601
Center ice.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.603
I'll be there.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.438
Almost there.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.973
Nice work, Sam.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.675
All right, let's do this.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.043
Not without cover.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.144
Boss?

32:27.146 --> 32:29.146
Bring me Sam's rifle.
Leah, spot me.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.581
Spike, Wordy,
you cover Sam.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.150
He's unarmed
and in plain view.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.018
Basic precautions, Sam.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.286
He trusts me.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.721
If he sees rifles,
what does that tell him?

32:37.723 --> 32:40.090
Okay, but how do we know
we can trust him?

32:41.327 --> 32:42.459
Well, there's your first sign.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.961
Yeah.

32:46.031 --> 32:48.665
So after Darren lost
his friends, what happened?

32:48.667 --> 32:52.035
Well, they sent him home
before his tour was up.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.303
How did he take that?

32:53.305 --> 32:56.006
ANDREW:
<i> He wasn't happy.</i>

32:56.008 --> 32:59.309
<i> Uh, he applied to get back</i>
<i> into combat,</i>

32:59.311 --> 33:02.679
<i> but the request was denied.</i>

33:02.681 --> 33:05.749
<i> They said he was</i>
<i> "no longer eligible."</i>

33:10.122 --> 33:12.189
In position.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.191
You're good to go.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.460
ANDREW:
<i> He wouldn't tell me why.</i>

33:16.462 --> 33:18.261
<i> Just that, you know,</i>
<i> they were wrong.</i>

33:18.263 --> 33:19.363
<i> He was "a good soldier."</i>

33:19.365 --> 33:21.365
PARKER:
Right behind you, Sam. Spike.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.367
But I knew in my gut.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.535
I knew why they wouldn't
take him back.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.472
There he is.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.413
Darren.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.448
It's me.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.584
It's Sam.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.393
SAM (over headset):
You made the right decision.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.232
We're going to get through this,
okay?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.333
DARREN:
I'm here!

33:56.335 --> 33:58.402
You see, Sam?

33:58.404 --> 34:00.370
I'm a good soldier.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.305
Get down on the ground!
Hands on your head!

34:12.384 --> 34:14.584
Get down on
the ground, now!
Stop, man, what are you...

34:14.586 --> 34:16.053
What are you doing?

34:17.823 --> 34:20.457
Think about this.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.059
You don't need

34:22.061 --> 34:24.227
to do this.
PARKER (over headset):
Sam, stop.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.263
Well, think about
what you're doing.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.366
I don't have a shot.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.170
Sam, stay right where you are.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.172
SAM:
I promised you we can get
through this, but...

34:35.174 --> 34:37.107
ED:
Get him to come to you.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.425
Bud...

34:38.426 --> 34:39.742
This is something
we can work through.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.546
You just have to...
you just have to trust that

34:42.548 --> 34:44.281
we can get through
this, okay?

34:44.283 --> 34:47.150
I'm a good soldier.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.218
I needed you
to know that.

34:48.220 --> 34:50.253
I know that. Buddy, I...

34:50.255 --> 34:51.822
SAM: You just gotta
stay with me, okay?

34:51.824 --> 34:53.523
Please, stay with me.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.127
See you on the other side.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.328
(gunshot)

34:58.330 --> 34:59.463
(body thuds)

35:05.637 --> 35:07.571
Subject down.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.346
Why did you do that?

35:18.450 --> 35:20.217
He wasn't going to shoot.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.121
Could've stuck it out.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.189
Huh?

35:27.292 --> 35:29.359
Weren't gonna shoot, were you?

35:36.135 --> 35:38.201
He wasn't gonna shoot.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.872
He wasn't gonna shoot!
(crying)

35:47.146 --> 35:50.180
All right, stay there.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.314
Any weapons?
No.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.883
No, I'm a security guard.
I work here.

35:52.885 --> 35:55.719
What?
I work here.
I'm a security guard.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.753
All right, get up.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.489
Shooting started,
I just went inside.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.790
It was stupid.
It's okay.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.326
As soon as I
see him, he sticks

36:03.328 --> 36:04.628
a gun in my back,
ties me up

36:04.630 --> 36:07.164
and puts me in a closet.
Just now he came back.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.266
He said he's shoot me
if I didn't do what he said.

36:09.268 --> 36:11.568
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.203
I'm so sorry.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.337
Yeah, that's okay.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.207
That's my son.
That's my son.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.909
You can't go in.
That's my son in there!

36:18.911 --> 36:20.343
You can't go in.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.214
That's my son in there!

36:24.216 --> 36:26.283
(sobbing)

36:38.297 --> 36:39.663
He wasn't going to shoot.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.364
It was an immediate threat.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.300
Took him 30 seconds
to turn the tables.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.969
We gave him the upper hand,
because we trusted him.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.438
No, I trusted him.
You killed him.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.240
Didn't have to
be like that.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.276
He was clearly threatening
both Spike and you.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.277
JULES:
Sam, you did great.

36:54.279 --> 36:55.479
You just, you lost perspective.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.680
You put yourself right
in the line of fire.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.281
(shouting over each other)

36:58.283 --> 36:59.282
Do you understand?!
I knew him.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.620
PARKER:
Okay, what do you
think he wanted, Sam?

37:03.622 --> 37:05.288
He wanted to save the arena.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.856
His military files.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.227
Look, he needed a mission

37:10.229 --> 37:12.696
to defend the last place left
where things made sense,

37:12.698 --> 37:13.897
where things were fair.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.332
But he wasn't going
to hurt me.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.967
We couldn't take that chance.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.969
You've never taken a chance?

37:18.971 --> 37:20.637
I've seen you do it!

37:20.639 --> 37:22.572
SPIKE:
He's got a point.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.541
You've done it, I've done it,
but the question is,

37:24.543 --> 37:26.977
why'd you do it?
For Darren?

37:26.979 --> 37:28.745
Or for Ben?

37:29.982 --> 37:32.582
Maybe you wanted a second chance
to save your friend.

37:35.254 --> 37:36.837
PARKER:
Jules?

37:36.838 --> 37:38.421
Darren applied
to return to service.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.724
He wanted to go back.
Why was he denied?

37:40.726 --> 37:42.993
Because they found him
"psychologically unfit."

37:42.995 --> 37:45.028
Darren was suffering
from post-traumatic stress,

37:45.030 --> 37:47.030
and he wanted
to go back.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.600
Sam, what was
the last thing he said?

37:51.637 --> 37:54.004
Uh, he said, uh...

37:54.006 --> 37:55.805
"I'm a good soldier."

37:55.807 --> 37:58.341
Roll back the tape.

37:58.343 --> 37:59.909
(remote beeping)

38:02.981 --> 38:04.848
Right there.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.416
The volume.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.951
Now.
(Darren speaks indistinctly)

38:07.953 --> 38:09.552
(gunshot)

38:12.758 --> 38:14.324
LEAH:
What did he say?

38:21.066 --> 38:22.732
DARREN (on tape):
See you on the other side.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.334
(gunshot)

38:25.637 --> 38:28.471
He said,
"See you on the other side."

38:28.473 --> 38:30.774
"SYOTOS."

38:30.776 --> 38:31.941
It's a battle cry.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.410
PARKER:
Yeah, but not

38:33.412 --> 38:35.062
this time.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.713
He was saying
good-bye to you, Sam.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.015
That's why he
wanted to go back.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.667
He thought he
should have died

38:40.668 --> 38:42.318
with his friends,
the first time around.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.359
"I'm so tired."

38:49.361 --> 38:51.828
That's when he knew
that it was over.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.963
PARKER:
Sam...

38:53.965 --> 38:57.033
His connection
with you was real, man.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.338
But he knew what he wanted.

39:01.340 --> 39:02.539
ED:
And there's nothing

39:02.541 --> 39:04.607
you could've done,
Sam, to change that.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.446
"It has to be you."

39:11.516 --> 39:12.782
He wanted me to kill him.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.417
Come on, Sam.

39:14.419 --> 39:15.885
Ah, that's all right,
I get it.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.397
Look...

39:27.399 --> 39:30.133
When I left the field
and I joined the SRU,

39:30.135 --> 39:32.001
I didn't want to be
a point-and-shoot guy.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.837
I didn't want to take people out
from a mile away.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.573
I wanted to... save people.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.641
You know, up close.

39:40.112 --> 39:43.046
And the one guy I should have
been able to reach...

39:43.048 --> 39:44.948
I mean, the one guy...

39:44.950 --> 39:46.883
I couldn't.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.152
I wasn't objective.
I put my team at risk.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.722
I don't belong here.

39:55.961 --> 40:00.397
¶ Don't go to sleep, child ¶

40:00.399 --> 40:03.032
¶ 'Cause we're doing
all we can ¶

40:03.034 --> 40:06.069
¶ And try to make you laugh ¶

40:06.071 --> 40:10.173
¶ And try to make you see ¶

40:10.175 --> 40:13.977

¶ And try to let you dream ¶

40:31.096 --> 40:34.431
¶ Give you the best

40:38.170 --> 40:39.903
Doesn't get any easier.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.540
We don't get
to win every time.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.577
You got to be at peace
with who you are

40:47.579 --> 40:50.079
to get through that.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.648
There's a bunch of guys
I know--

40:51.650 --> 40:53.183
they're cops
and military guys--

40:53.185 --> 40:55.002
we meet up and we talk

40:55.003 --> 40:56.820
and we help each other
keep it together.

40:56.822 --> 40:59.222
Greg and I are going
Friday night.

41:00.492 --> 41:02.192
You should come.

41:02.194 --> 41:06.863
¶ 'Cause we're doing
all we can ¶

41:11.203 --> 41:16.806
¶ 'Cause I... ¶

41:20.579 --> 41:23.813
