WEBVTT

00:12.916 --> 00:13.949
(birds chirping)

00:14.017 --> 00:15.261
KRISTEN:
Thank you for hosting

00:15.381 --> 00:16.433
Christmas dinner tomorrow night,
by the way.

00:16.565 --> 00:18.566
You didn't give me much choice.

00:18.617 --> 00:20.902
Hey, you're the one who
<i>has</i> to watch Wilfred.

00:20.953 --> 00:23.103
And there's no way he's
coming back to my place.

00:23.155 --> 00:26.407
Last time, he did that, like,
fish juice thing on my carpets.

00:28.076 --> 00:29.994
Are you nervous?

00:30.078 --> 00:31.212
No.

00:31.279 --> 00:33.130
Really?

00:33.215 --> 00:35.416
You and Dad haven't seen each
other in almost two years.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.752
I just saw Dad a month ago
at the grocery store.

00:37.803 --> 00:40.221
We had a little chat
over some champagne.

00:40.288 --> 00:42.456
Very funny.

00:42.507 --> 00:44.725
Don't worry.
The therapy really helped.

00:44.793 --> 00:46.677
I'm going into this
with an open mind.

00:46.762 --> 00:47.962
Good.

00:48.013 --> 00:49.680
Also, I have a little surprise.

00:49.765 --> 00:51.766
Um, Mom's insane asylum is...

00:51.817 --> 00:54.235
It's not an insane asylum.
It has, like... ducks.

00:54.302 --> 00:57.321
Fine. Her duck sanctuary is
allowing her five hours

00:57.406 --> 00:59.023
of supervised visitation
tomorrow night.

00:59.107 --> 01:00.691
So, for the first
time in years,

01:00.776 --> 01:02.309
the whole family is
gonna be together.

01:02.361 --> 01:04.194
Look, it's not gonna
be a cakewalk,

01:04.279 --> 01:07.031
but I want Joffrey to have
a normal holiday experience,

01:07.115 --> 01:09.250
which means being surrounded
by his entire family.

01:09.317 --> 01:11.585
Fine. But if Mom and Dad
start fighting,

01:11.653 --> 01:14.288
I'm putting Joffrey in one
of their laps to distract them.

01:14.339 --> 01:16.590
You want to use my baby?

01:16.658 --> 01:18.342
That's genius.
Hey!

01:18.427 --> 01:21.462
Fancy meeting you guys here!

01:21.513 --> 01:23.047
I'm sorry.
No dogs allowed.

01:23.131 --> 01:24.331
I'm just... (sighs)

01:24.383 --> 01:26.667
Sorry.
Yeah. It's cool.

01:26.718 --> 01:29.053
I'll just... mail
my Christmas list to Santa.

01:29.137 --> 01:30.972
Want to hear
what I'm asking for?

01:31.023 --> 01:32.840
Sure.
A Big Wheel,

01:32.891 --> 01:34.525
so I can drag
Santa's severed head

01:34.609 --> 01:35.943
through the streets of Venice.

01:36.011 --> 01:37.778
A Darth Vader action figure,

01:37.846 --> 01:40.364
so I can stick that plastic,
tiny, little lightsaber

01:40.449 --> 01:42.182
into Santa's urethra.

01:42.234 --> 01:43.567
A catcher's mitt, so I can make

01:43.652 --> 01:45.736
cruel comparisons
to Mrs. Claus's vagina.

01:45.821 --> 01:47.822
Why do you hate Santa so much?

01:47.873 --> 01:50.241
Santa is the mailman
on steroids.

01:50.325 --> 01:52.159
I mean, this guy comes
into your house--

01:52.210 --> 01:55.413
<i>into</i> your house-- leaves
packages covered with his scent,

01:55.497 --> 01:57.131
calls you "ho" three times.

01:57.198 --> 02:00.084
Keep in mind, this is a guy
who has sex with reindeer.

02:00.168 --> 02:01.969
Wilfred, you realize
that Santa isn't r...

02:02.037 --> 02:03.587
Isn't ready to get
his ass beat?

02:03.672 --> 02:05.589
Yeah, I know.
That diabetic blobmeister

02:05.674 --> 02:07.091
doesn't have the balls
to show his face

02:07.175 --> 02:08.342
when Wilfred's in the house!

02:08.393 --> 02:09.844
Yeah, what's up, tits?!
Wilfred!

02:09.895 --> 02:11.211
I'm not gonna do nothing
while your goons

02:11.263 --> 02:12.079
are around.

02:12.199 --> 02:12.995
Yeah, we're cool.

02:13.115 --> 02:13.998
We're cool.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.167 --> 02:24.575
Wilfred! No!
I'm sorry.

02:24.659 --> 02:27.394
You see how that
could be confusing.

02:27.446 --> 02:28.746
God.
Are you okay, mate?

02:28.830 --> 02:31.231
Y-You seem anxious.

02:31.283 --> 02:32.283
(sighs)

02:32.367 --> 02:33.901
I'm just worried about tonight.

02:33.952 --> 02:36.670
I-I was prepared
to deal with my dad,

02:36.738 --> 02:38.789
but Mom and Dad together?

02:38.874 --> 02:40.708
You and your mum get along great.
Yeah,

02:40.759 --> 02:43.044
but when my parents fight,
she's like a loose cannon.

02:43.095 --> 02:45.429
I just don't want her to say
a bunch of stuff about me

02:45.514 --> 02:46.514
in front of my dad.

02:46.581 --> 02:47.414
Like what?

02:47.466 --> 02:48.933
Like why I quit his firm.

02:49.017 --> 02:50.434
How I tried to kill myself.

02:50.519 --> 02:51.769
Maybe it's time your dad

02:51.853 --> 02:53.771
found out how much
he screwed you up.

02:53.855 --> 02:56.273
I mean, you've always said
he's a manipulative bully.

02:56.358 --> 02:58.225
Now's your chance
to stand up to him.

02:58.276 --> 03:01.312
Perhaps in the form of
a "Beat It" style knife fight.

03:01.396 --> 03:03.764
I can't do that.
(sighs) Sure you can.

03:03.815 --> 03:06.150
Just lock your arms together,
hold your knives up,

03:06.234 --> 03:08.035
and then dance your ass off.

03:09.321 --> 03:11.489
Look, standing up to my dad

03:11.573 --> 03:13.273
is not gonna help
us start over.

03:13.325 --> 03:15.275
All I want is to get
through this evening

03:15.327 --> 03:16.877
with as little stress
as possible.

03:16.945 --> 03:19.380
Say no more. I'll stop
badgering you about your dad.

03:19.447 --> 03:22.299
Besides, Christmas is a time
for families to come together

03:22.384 --> 03:24.168
to share yuletide joy.

03:24.252 --> 03:25.953
And, yeah, I mean,

03:26.004 --> 03:28.339
Jenna and Drew did go back
to Wisconsin without me, but...

03:28.423 --> 03:30.424
I'm excited about spending
Christmas with you!

03:30.475 --> 03:32.726
And being a part
of <i>your</i> family.

03:32.794 --> 03:35.012
(sighs)
Uh, actually...

03:35.097 --> 03:38.099
with my mom coming now,

03:38.150 --> 03:40.234
would you mind hanging out
in the basement?

03:42.020 --> 03:45.156
B-But it's-it's not Christmas
without Wilfred.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.120
Would it help if I said
that there was an eighth

03:47.159 --> 03:48.826
of Silver Haze down there?

03:48.910 --> 03:50.861
A-And-and the DVD player's
already loaded up

03:50.946 --> 03:51.946
with <i>Jingle All the Way?</i>

03:53.248 --> 03:56.083
It helps.

03:57.285 --> 03:58.786
(doorbell rings)

03:58.837 --> 04:00.671
That's probably Dad.
Um, here, here.

04:00.755 --> 04:02.489
Let me stir that
while you get the door.

04:02.541 --> 04:04.658
Ryan, you're gonna have
to see Dad eventually.

04:08.496 --> 04:10.764
(exhales)

04:10.832 --> 04:12.800
♪ On the first day
of Christmas ♪

04:12.851 --> 04:15.019
♪ My true love gave to me
a partridge ♪

04:15.103 --> 04:17.337
♪ In a pear...
Thanks, but now's not a good time.

04:17.389 --> 04:18.672
Dick!

04:18.723 --> 04:19.807
(shouts)
Oh...

04:19.858 --> 04:21.841
Shit!
Well, just relax.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.510
It's just flour.
Sorry.

04:23.562 --> 04:26.280
I-I'm just a little on edge
about seeing Dad, I guess.

04:26.347 --> 04:28.532
HENRY: If it makes you
feel any better,

04:28.617 --> 04:30.517
I'm nervous, too.

04:30.569 --> 04:32.870
I saw a strange Indian couple
assaulting people

04:32.954 --> 04:34.555
with what may have been
Christmas carols,

04:34.573 --> 04:36.190
so to avoid them,
I-I went around back.

04:36.241 --> 04:38.375
I hope you don't mind
that I let myself in.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.744
Merry Christmas, Daddy!

04:40.829 --> 04:42.630
Merry Christmas, pumpkin.
(inhales)

04:42.697 --> 04:46.083
Mmm. Is that a... new perfume?

04:46.168 --> 04:48.502
No, but I can a new perfume.
Should I? I-I should.

04:48.553 --> 04:51.255
(timer dings)
Oh. I've got to put the potatoes in.

04:51.339 --> 04:53.140
Uh, potatoes au gratin--
your favorite, right, Dad?

04:53.208 --> 04:55.059
Well...

04:55.143 --> 04:57.011
(clicks tongue, sighs)

05:00.015 --> 05:01.482
(exhales)

05:01.549 --> 05:03.884
So...

05:03.935 --> 05:05.569
How have you been?

05:05.654 --> 05:07.521
Good, yeah.

05:07.572 --> 05:09.773
You seem like you're...
doing better.

05:09.858 --> 05:11.225
I am.

05:13.245 --> 05:15.229
Kristen tells me
you have a roommate.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.066
Yeah. Uh, sh-she's spending
the holidays with some friends.

05:22.204 --> 05:24.705
(knocking)
Excuse me.

05:24.756 --> 05:27.074
No, I've got it.
(chuckles)

05:28.376 --> 05:30.461
Merry Christmas, poopy pants!

05:30.545 --> 05:32.412
(chuckles)
Well, I know

05:32.464 --> 05:36.217
you're all grown-up, but I will
always think of you that way.

05:36.268 --> 05:37.301
Hello, Catherine.

05:37.385 --> 05:38.852
Henry.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.105
Hey, you!

05:41.189 --> 05:42.940
Mom.
(gasps, squeals)

05:43.024 --> 05:44.975
I don't know why I'm so excited.
(chuckles)

05:45.060 --> 05:47.695
It's only been a couple of
weeks since I've seen you.

05:47.762 --> 05:50.314
Ryan comes to visit me
every single month.

05:50.398 --> 05:52.650
That's nice. Who's your friend?

05:52.734 --> 05:57.071
Oh. This is Andre,
my date for the night.

05:57.122 --> 05:58.822
Hands off, Desdemona.

05:58.907 --> 05:59.907
Mom.
Actually,

05:59.958 --> 06:01.108
I'm the caretaker assigned

06:01.159 --> 06:02.243
to accompany your mother
tonight.

06:02.294 --> 06:03.661
It's complicated.

06:03.745 --> 06:05.079
It's not complicated at all.

06:05.130 --> 06:06.630
I'm gonna wait in the car.

06:06.715 --> 06:08.382
No, no. Come in.
It's Christmas.

06:08.449 --> 06:12.253
I'm a Buddhist.

06:12.304 --> 06:14.088
Sorry about that!
CATHERINE: I don't know why

06:14.139 --> 06:16.423
your father feels like he has
to apologize for me.

06:16.474 --> 06:18.509
It's not like I'm
his property anymore.

06:18.593 --> 06:20.594
(chuckles)
(chuckles): No. Your mother's right, Ryan.

06:20.645 --> 06:22.012
Andre wasn't
at all uncomfortable

06:22.097 --> 06:23.764
when she said they were dating.

06:23.815 --> 06:26.183
He's probably running out
to the car to get

06:26.268 --> 06:27.968
the engagement ring.
(chuckles)

06:28.019 --> 06:29.469
KRISTEN:
Uh-oh.

06:29.521 --> 06:31.772
Somebody wants to see
his Grammy and Pop-pop.

06:31.823 --> 06:33.907
It's my little

06:33.975 --> 06:35.809
Joff muffin.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.611
(chuckles):
Oh!

06:37.662 --> 06:39.446
Careful with his head.

06:39.497 --> 06:42.950
Oh, but my whole plan was
to let his little neck

06:43.001 --> 06:45.753
bend all the way back.
(chuckles)

06:45.820 --> 06:47.504
Oh, I got you, Joffrey.

06:47.589 --> 06:51.008
Oh, you're not
a Pez dispenser, are you?

06:51.092 --> 06:52.593
(chuckles)
Be careful, Joff muffin,

06:52.660 --> 06:55.429
once Pop-Pop gets you
in his loving clutches,

06:55.496 --> 06:57.831
he will never let you go. Like, never.
RYAN: Oh!

06:57.882 --> 07:01.302
Look at him smile.
It's so cute, right?

07:01.353 --> 07:03.170
Uncle Ryan knows all about
getting caught

07:03.221 --> 07:04.972
in Pop-Pop's loving clutches,
doesn't he?

07:05.023 --> 07:06.223
(bells jingling)

07:06.308 --> 07:08.342
What is that?

07:08.393 --> 07:10.344
(jingling grows louder)

07:13.365 --> 07:16.850
Merry Christmas, everybody!

07:16.901 --> 07:19.486
(chuckles) You're not
supposed to be here.

07:19.537 --> 07:21.288
Well, you said Wilfred wasn't
allowed at your dinner,

07:21.356 --> 07:26.243
but you didn't say anything
about Santa's reindeer!

07:26.328 --> 07:28.629
That is <i>so</i> cute, Ryan!

07:28.696 --> 07:30.864
(chuckles)
Who's the pretty girl?

07:30.915 --> 07:34.301
Girl? Do you not see this penis
right here?

07:34.369 --> 07:36.420
Uh, no, that's actually
a gumdrop stuck on my fur.

07:36.504 --> 07:38.005
His name is Wilfred.

07:38.056 --> 07:40.374
Sorry. I'll just put him back
in the other room

07:40.425 --> 07:41.809
so he won't be a distraction.

07:41.876 --> 07:44.428
Oh, no, no, no,
let Wilfred stay.

07:44.512 --> 07:45.813
He's not hurting anybody.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.848
Well...

07:47.899 --> 07:50.184
I guess it wouldn't be Christmas
without Wilfred.

07:50.235 --> 07:52.552
Now that's the spirit.

07:59.084 --> 08:01.085
CATHERINE (laughs):
Look at him go!

08:01.170 --> 08:02.720
(Henry laughs)

08:05.507 --> 08:07.225
(panting)

08:07.309 --> 08:09.343
Oh, man, getting tangled up

08:09.394 --> 08:11.646
in Christmas lights
is a workout.

08:16.185 --> 08:17.551
(gasps)

08:17.603 --> 08:20.009
Okay, that is
not ice-cold Gatorade.

08:20.129 --> 08:21.779
I should not have done that.

08:21.831 --> 08:24.478
Your dad is exactly how
I pictured him:

08:24.519 --> 08:25.736
pure evil.

08:25.821 --> 08:28.189
He even looks like Michael Vick.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.792
Actually, he's been
surprisingly okay tonight.

08:30.859 --> 08:32.525
Listen,
I-I've been thinking.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.412
You were right.

08:34.496 --> 08:36.881
Christmas <i>is</i> a time for family
and yuletide joy.

08:36.965 --> 08:39.167
Cut the figgy pudding.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.885
I know you're only using me

08:40.969 --> 08:42.535
to distract your parents
from fighting.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.755
Well, then why are you still
playing along?

08:44.840 --> 08:46.424
I'm not playing along.

08:46.508 --> 08:48.309
I keeps it Christmasy, Ryan.

08:48.376 --> 08:50.928
So, are you going to keep
keeping it Christmasy?

08:51.013 --> 08:55.516
Sure. I'll give you the gift
of keeping mom and dad jolly.

08:55.567 --> 08:59.053
But in return,
I want something from you.

08:59.104 --> 09:01.522
The gift of being
part of your family.

09:01.573 --> 09:03.941
That's it?

09:04.026 --> 09:05.193
Sure.

09:09.531 --> 09:10.915
Oh, mm-mm.

09:10.999 --> 09:12.416
The meds.

09:12.501 --> 09:14.418
Ooh, Ryan, is that a cabernet?

09:14.503 --> 09:16.087
Because, you know,
Dad only drinks Bordeaux.

09:16.171 --> 09:17.839
I picked up bottle this morning.

09:17.906 --> 09:20.091
The one in the kitchen?
The 2003?

09:20.175 --> 09:21.425
Not a good year?

09:21.510 --> 09:22.460
No...

09:22.544 --> 09:24.178
I can get you a beer instead.

09:24.246 --> 09:25.513
I'm fine, pumpkin.

09:25.580 --> 09:26.661
WILFRED:
Pumpkin? (chuckles)

09:26.715 --> 09:28.466
Okay, just so I understand,

09:28.550 --> 09:30.990
your dad nicknamed his daughter
after the scent of her vagina?

09:31.019 --> 09:33.554
(chuckles)
Cool!

09:33.605 --> 09:35.256
Ah, thanks, Mom!

09:35.307 --> 09:38.192
Can you, uh, toss us
the butter as well, please?

09:38.260 --> 09:40.811
Should we be feeding
the dog human food?

09:40.896 --> 09:42.396
Okay, Henry. Hmm.

09:42.447 --> 09:43.898
I don't think we should be

09:43.949 --> 09:45.233
taking dog advice
from your father.

09:45.284 --> 09:46.984
Why is that?

09:47.069 --> 09:49.704
Um, maybe because you used
to kick Sneakers.

09:49.771 --> 09:51.789
I didn't kick him,
Catherine. I shoved him

09:51.874 --> 09:54.041
gently with my foot
to teach him not to beg

09:54.109 --> 09:55.626
just like the trainer taught us.

09:55.711 --> 09:56.827
Uh, okay.

09:56.912 --> 09:58.496
I guess I-I should have let him

09:58.580 --> 09:59.881
drink strawberry milk
instead of water

09:59.948 --> 10:01.132
so he'd have
terrible, chronic gas.

10:01.216 --> 10:02.333
(laughs)

10:02.417 --> 10:03.257
WILFRED:
You did that?

10:03.302 --> 10:05.002
That's so beautiful.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.971
Oh maybe you just didn't take
to Sneakers

10:07.055 --> 10:08.839
because he wasn't
obedient enough.

10:08.924 --> 10:10.558
He didn't follow commands.

10:14.763 --> 10:17.148
Speaking of Sneakers...

10:17.232 --> 10:20.484
remember that one Christmas
when Sneakers snuck downstairs

10:20.569 --> 10:22.153
and ate all of Santa's cookies?

10:22.237 --> 10:23.521
(laughter)

10:23.605 --> 10:24.972
Shit! Go, Sneakers.

10:25.023 --> 10:26.524
Was that that same Christmas

10:26.608 --> 10:29.110
that Ryan got that
electric guitar he wanted?

10:29.161 --> 10:31.112
Oh, no. Wait.
He didn't get the guitar.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.530
What did you give him, Henry?

10:32.614 --> 10:34.332
Oh, yeah.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.667
An engraved Tiffany pen.

10:36.752 --> 10:38.252
A pen.

10:41.790 --> 10:45.259
Track 12.

10:45.327 --> 10:47.595
Hey, how about some music?

10:49.831 --> 10:51.549
(intro to "Deck the Halls"
plays)

10:51.633 --> 10:54.602
♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪

10:54.669 --> 10:57.188
♪ Fa, la-la, la-la,
la-la, la-la... ♪

10:57.272 --> 10:59.890
(laughter)

10:59.975 --> 11:01.275
It's like he's trying to sing.

11:01.343 --> 11:02.693
(laughter)

11:02.778 --> 11:05.529
Trying. Uh, was Oates trying?

11:05.614 --> 11:07.181
KRISTEN:
Hey, careful.

11:07.232 --> 11:08.682
We're taking a family photo
after dinner,

11:08.734 --> 11:10.451
and you know how easily
you get droopy drunk face.

11:10.518 --> 11:12.620
Oh. Family photo.

11:12.687 --> 11:15.856
I'm assuming I'll be in it, uh,
since I'm part of the family?

11:18.526 --> 11:21.245
Ryan, he already ruined
Joffrey's photo with Santa.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.381
I know, but it'd
mean a lot to me.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.882
Fine. We'll take two photos.

11:24.967 --> 11:27.201
But you know what
would mean a lot to me?

11:27.252 --> 11:28.970
If you didn't have
wine mouth right now.

11:29.037 --> 11:31.055
WILFRED:
Sorry I'm late.

11:31.139 --> 11:33.099
I was deciding between this
and a leather harness,

11:33.141 --> 11:35.176
but, honestly,
the harness seemed

11:35.227 --> 11:37.511
a little too S&M-y
for Christmas.

11:37.562 --> 11:38.763
Are we-we
good to go?

11:38.847 --> 11:40.381
Okay, we're gonna take
one official

11:40.432 --> 11:42.433
family photo, and then,
one weird random photo

11:42.517 --> 11:44.602
for Ryan's neighbor's dog
that I'm going to delete

11:44.686 --> 11:46.654
the second after
I e-mail it to Ryan.

11:46.721 --> 11:48.555
I'm not in the official
family photo?

11:50.659 --> 11:53.160
It's okay.

11:53.228 --> 11:55.079
Don't worry, Ryan.

11:55.163 --> 11:57.999
Ryan, your log
still burns bright.

11:58.066 --> 12:00.368
Ryan?

12:04.072 --> 12:06.374
(sighs)

12:07.909 --> 12:09.427
(laughs)

12:09.511 --> 12:11.262
You're gonna love it.

12:11.346 --> 12:12.880
I use mine every day.

12:12.931 --> 12:14.382
Oh, thanks, Mom.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.850
HENRY:
Looks like there's

12:15.917 --> 12:17.184
one more gift under the tree.

12:17.252 --> 12:18.752
Oh.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.938
"To the Newman family."

12:21.023 --> 12:23.024
(laughs)
Who's it from?

12:23.091 --> 12:24.692
Ooh!

12:24.759 --> 12:26.027
A mystery gift.
Oh, yeah.

12:26.094 --> 12:27.428
Shall I open it?

12:27.479 --> 12:29.763
KRISTEN:
Mm-hmm.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.601
(both laugh)

12:37.572 --> 12:39.490
HENRY:
Look at that.

12:39.574 --> 12:41.492
The whole family.

12:41.576 --> 12:44.111
All together.

12:44.162 --> 12:46.664
Why are you smirking like that?

12:46.748 --> 12:49.917
Wait. Is this from you?

12:49.968 --> 12:51.785
What?
Okay.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.338
I get it. That's... me,

12:54.423 --> 12:56.724
crazy Catherine,
standing between you

12:56.791 --> 12:59.093
and your perfect little family,
tearing it apart.

12:59.144 --> 13:00.895
Catherine, I didn't do it.

13:00.962 --> 13:02.796
Okay, well,
you are the one that

13:02.848 --> 13:04.765
tore this family apart, Henry,

13:04.816 --> 13:06.967
because you're the one
who made me crazy!

13:07.018 --> 13:09.970
(baby crying)
Catherine, please, calm down.

13:10.021 --> 13:12.356
Uh, hey, look, look, Wilfred's
playing with the, um...

13:12.441 --> 13:15.276
Mm, I will not stand by

13:15.327 --> 13:18.162
and let you do to Ryan
what you did to me!

13:18.246 --> 13:21.082
Ryan, I think we should get
your mother's nurse.

13:21.149 --> 13:23.084
Tell them, Ryan.
Tell them how...

13:23.151 --> 13:25.369
how-how he broke you down

13:25.454 --> 13:27.654
so-so you didn't even
feel human anymore,

13:27.706 --> 13:30.341
and how you... how you felt
like the only way out was...

13:30.425 --> 13:31.792
was to just take
your own life...

13:31.843 --> 13:33.928
Mom, enough! Shut up!

13:33.995 --> 13:37.381
All you've been doing all night
is-is bringing up the past

13:37.466 --> 13:39.124
and starting shit with Dad.

13:39.244 --> 13:40.378
This was supposed

13:40.445 --> 13:41.662
to be a special night

13:41.747 --> 13:42.709
to celebrate Joffrey's

13:42.829 --> 13:44.158
first Christmas with his family,

13:44.278 --> 13:46.325
and now you've completely
ruined it!

13:50.889 --> 13:53.123
(panting)

13:59.453 --> 14:00.895
So much for your
Christmas spirit.

14:01.027 --> 14:02.527
What are you talking about?
Just 'cause you weren't

14:02.612 --> 14:03.979
allowed in one photo, you had

14:04.030 --> 14:05.196
to sabotage Christmas
with that drawing?

14:05.281 --> 14:06.648
Of course not, Ryan.

14:06.699 --> 14:08.700
Sure, I was hurt,

14:08.784 --> 14:11.202
but I put that under the tree
before anyone even arrived.

14:11.287 --> 14:13.521
It was an actual gift
meant to thank you all

14:13.572 --> 14:15.540
for letting me be part
of your family tonight.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.191
How was I supposed to know

14:17.243 --> 14:18.994
any of that was gonna happen
back there?

14:19.045 --> 14:20.829
In any normal family,

14:20.880 --> 14:22.697
a drawing like that would have
brought everyone together.

14:22.748 --> 14:25.500
Yeah, well,
with a Mom like Catherine,

14:25.551 --> 14:26.885
this is what happens.

14:26.969 --> 14:28.470
Come on, Ryan.

14:28.537 --> 14:30.839
You know tonight
wasn't your mom's fault.

14:30.890 --> 14:33.391
Then whose?
My dad's?

14:33.476 --> 14:36.044
He's been nothing
but calm and polite.

14:36.095 --> 14:38.480
It's my mom
who's been starting everything.

14:38.547 --> 14:41.099
So you haven't noticed him
pushing her buttons all night?

14:41.183 --> 14:43.985
Apologizing to her nurse
for her?

14:44.053 --> 14:45.403
Criticizing the way
she holds Joffrey

14:45.488 --> 14:46.655
or the way she fed me?

14:46.722 --> 14:48.773
Smirking at the drawing?

14:48.858 --> 14:50.391
The guy's a manipulative bully.

14:50.443 --> 14:52.744
But what does he have to gain?

14:52.828 --> 14:54.696
What he's always wanted:
control over you.

14:54.747 --> 14:57.499
I mean, it's obvious how close
you and your mom have gotten.

14:57.566 --> 14:59.067
He had to find a way to

14:59.118 --> 15:00.502
tear you apart.

15:00.569 --> 15:02.087
I mean,
this whole night has been

15:02.171 --> 15:04.506
yet another giant manipulation,
Henry Newman style.

15:16.302 --> 15:19.087
Kristen and the nurse
are with your mother.

15:19.138 --> 15:22.223
It's been a while since
I've seen her this bad.

15:22.274 --> 15:24.592
I hope she's okay.

15:24.643 --> 15:27.062
Do you?

15:27.113 --> 15:29.114
Or-or maybe you've been
taunting her all night,

15:29.198 --> 15:30.615
trying to get a rise out of her.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.117
Maybe you wanted this to happen.

15:32.201 --> 15:34.035
Of course not.

15:34.103 --> 15:36.154
Tonight was a mistake.

15:36.238 --> 15:38.406
I-I never should have agreed
to see you again.

15:38.457 --> 15:41.376
Not until I was ready
to tell you how I really feel.

15:41.443 --> 15:43.277
Ryan, if you need
to say something...

15:43.329 --> 15:46.631
I've needed to say something
to you for the last 20 years.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.834
I became a lawyer
before you even let me consider

15:49.919 --> 15:52.286
what I might actually
want to do with my life.

15:52.338 --> 15:54.422
I never meant to force
you into anything.

15:54.473 --> 15:57.809
You could have always
told me the truth.

15:57.893 --> 16:00.261
And disappoint you? No, no.

16:00.312 --> 16:03.314
I saw firsthand what happens
to people who disappoint you.

16:03.399 --> 16:05.517
I saw what happened to Mom.
Ryan...

16:05.601 --> 16:07.652
Working for you was so toxic.

16:07.737 --> 16:08.970
Do you want to know why I quit?

16:09.021 --> 16:10.655
Because I knew that

16:10.740 --> 16:12.824
if I stayed there any longer,
it'd kill me.

16:12.908 --> 16:15.193
Oh.

16:15.277 --> 16:17.996
It nearly did.

16:20.649 --> 16:23.651
What are you saying?

16:25.588 --> 16:27.872
I tried to kill myself.

16:27.957 --> 16:30.258
Oh, my God.

16:32.494 --> 16:34.846
I...

16:34.930 --> 16:38.332
I don't know what to say.

16:38.384 --> 16:42.503
Look, I swear, I wasn't trying
to provoke your mother tonight.

16:42.555 --> 16:44.689
But everything you said

16:44.774 --> 16:47.725
about your experience at
the firm is probably true.

16:47.810 --> 16:50.111
Ryan,

16:50.179 --> 16:52.730
if I'd known my behavior
would have this effect on you,

16:52.815 --> 16:54.199
that it would push you to...

16:57.019 --> 16:59.871
However I need to change...

16:59.955 --> 17:02.574
I'll change.

17:02.658 --> 17:06.544
I just can't go another two
years without you in my life.

17:13.836 --> 17:15.670
Mrs. Newman,

17:15.721 --> 17:18.372
if you don't open the door
right this second, then...

17:18.424 --> 17:20.642
no more Wasabi Funyuns
in the rec room.

17:22.711 --> 17:24.145
All right, that shit's on you.

17:24.213 --> 17:25.646
You know you're gonna want 'em.

17:25.714 --> 17:27.648
Can I give it a try?

17:27.715 --> 17:29.184
Good luck.
(sighs)

17:33.689 --> 17:35.907
Mom, it's Ryan.

17:38.327 --> 17:40.078
I'm sorry.

17:40.162 --> 17:43.448
I shouldn't have said
that you ruined Christmas.

17:43.532 --> 17:45.834
I don't actually think that.

17:45.901 --> 17:48.586
(toilet flushes)

17:48.671 --> 17:51.089
Mom, are you listening?

17:56.428 --> 17:58.763
You don't have to apologize.

17:58.848 --> 18:00.265
It's my fault.

18:00.349 --> 18:02.517
After all these
years, I just...

18:02.584 --> 18:05.136
still haven't figured out

18:05.221 --> 18:07.605
how to not let your father
get to me.

18:07.690 --> 18:09.941
I know how you feel.

18:12.561 --> 18:14.946
Ryan, Ryan,

18:15.030 --> 18:17.265
this is the greatest Christmas
gift anyone's ever given me.

18:17.316 --> 18:18.933
You're welcome.

18:18.984 --> 18:21.269
Just get over there
before Kristen changes her mind.

18:23.239 --> 18:25.606
Where's Dad?

18:25.658 --> 18:28.743
I don't know,
but I do know where Santa is!

18:28.794 --> 18:30.211
You can come out now!

18:30.279 --> 18:31.713
Santa's here?

18:31.780 --> 18:33.498
Oh, shit is about to get real!

18:33.582 --> 18:35.616
Ho! Ho! Ho!

18:35.668 --> 18:36.718
Merry...
(farting, splattering)

18:36.785 --> 18:38.303
Oh, no! Wilfred!

18:38.387 --> 18:39.304
Get him outside!
CATHERINE: Oh!

18:39.388 --> 18:41.339
Dripping on the stairs.

18:41.423 --> 18:43.308
(whimpers):
Ryan.

18:43.392 --> 18:44.125
Oh!

18:48.115 --> 18:50.417
Despite the drama,
it was a good Christmas.

18:50.501 --> 18:53.036
And I feel like maybe my dad
and I can finally--

18:53.087 --> 18:54.908
I don't know-- start over.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.206
So you believed him?

18:56.257 --> 18:58.408
What do you mean?

18:58.459 --> 19:00.543
Maybe your dad upset your mom
because he knew

19:00.594 --> 19:02.095
you'd confront him
and reconcile.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.695
That way, he gets you back
in his clutches.

19:04.815 --> 19:06.532
No, I can't think
like that anymore.

19:06.616 --> 19:10.953
By the way, so annoying
that I got that stomach virus

19:11.020 --> 19:14.990
right before I was about to rip
out that Santa bitch's weave.

19:15.041 --> 19:18.878
Listen, I-I think it's time
someone told you the truth.

19:20.103 --> 19:21.519
Santa isn't real.

19:21.639 --> 19:22.531
What?

19:22.582 --> 19:25.000
Because no one else can see him,
that means he isn't real?

19:25.051 --> 19:26.302
(scoffs)

19:30.173 --> 19:31.974
No glass allowed at Clouds.

19:32.041 --> 19:35.060
Right. Thanks, and namaste.

19:35.145 --> 19:36.762
(sucks teeth)

19:36.847 --> 19:38.430
Bye.

19:38.515 --> 19:40.483
Oh. Merry Christmas, Mom.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.768
You, too. We never did

19:42.853 --> 19:45.154
find out where
that came from tonight, did we?

19:45.221 --> 19:46.906
Oh.

19:47.758 --> 19:50.381
Um, well, actually,
it-it was from me.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.392
I found it in a box
of my old things

19:52.512 --> 19:53.457
from when I was a kid.

19:53.577 --> 19:55.526
Oh. Well, this isn't
your drawing.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.395
You were a little more
spontaneous than that.

19:58.515 --> 19:59.555
At least until your father

19:59.575 --> 20:01.350
stomped your imagination
to death.

20:01.470 --> 20:02.849
Then, who drew it?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.372
Kristen.
