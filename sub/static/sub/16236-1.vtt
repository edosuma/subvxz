01:22.332 --> 01:23.925
I was just thinking that...

01:27.963 --> 01:29.510
I could sleep in here tonight.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.101
In here? Why?
Something wrong with your room?

01:32.175 --> 01:34.724

air conditioner completely...

No.

Well, then what?

02:01.913 --> 02:04.211
I had pork for lunch and I...
Mmm-hmm.

02:05.167 --> 02:09.217
I think it's probably
best if we just... If I...

02:09.463 --> 02:11.306
Mmm-hmm. That's okay.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.800
What do you mean?

04:18.884 --> 04:22.934
Like you mostly eat in on
Fridays and then you eat out?

04:23.013 --> 04:24.230
Or that you're at
each ether's throats

04:24.306 --> 04:27.230

04:36.693 --> 04:38.695
Well, if you wanted it to.

04:39.863 --> 04:44.414
No, I think for that to happen,
it would have to be so bad

04:44.493 --> 04:48.043
that somebody was willing to risk
everything just to shake things up

04:48.705 --> 04:50.332
and then it may not
come down your way.

04:50.832 --> 04:54.336
No, change is hard.
Marriages don't change.

Hey, what are you making tonight?
The kids still coming over?

04:59.508 --> 05:01.226

Oh,
they are so beautiful!

Huh, Arnold?
Just what we needed.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.481
Mmm-hmm.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.777
I picked them out.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.900
Show-off.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.031
So what'd you guys
get each other?

05:15.106 --> 05:18.827
Yeah, 31. What gift is that?
Silver? Ivory? Paper?

05:18.902 --> 05:22.577
No, it isn't anything special.
Just an off year.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.625
Oh! We got each other
the new cable subscription.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.581
Oh, great.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.544
It's a lot of channels.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.089
First of all, so many
of you are dealing with,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.470
"Should I open the club face,
or should I do this?”"

05:42.592 --> 05:44.060
You can learn to
break like this.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.513
All he's doing is he's
taking the club back.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.519
He doesn't have a lot
of wrist hinge at all.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.568
In fact, in the down-the-line view,
what his swing looks like is,

05:51.643 --> 05:54.817
the head of the club
is outside of the hands here.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.364
Very, very late wrist set.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.237
He gets up into here,
like this,

05:58.316 --> 06:00.569
and then his body
is moving forward

06:00.652 --> 06:02.319
while the club
is going backwards

06:02.320 --> 06:03.913
and that's how you get this real...

06:06.950 --> 06:07.997
Arnold.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.645
Turn off the air down here?

08:38.434 --> 08:42.280
I see couples who think
their marriages are over.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.656
Who feel like it's impossible
to regain what they once had.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.036
Well, it's not. it's not impossible.
And it's not too late

08:52.115 --> 08:56.040

What do we got?

09:45.794 --> 09:47.011
I want to go.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.183
"Dr. Bernard Feld, Center for
intensive Couples Counseling."

09:51.257 --> 09:53.601
You want to go to
intensive couples counseling?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.178
In Maine.
Maine.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.729
Only half the day.

09:56.805 --> 10:00.651
Rest of the day you can read,
or look around the town.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.977
$4,000 for a week?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.228
Well, it's intensive.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.779
Have to be gold-plated.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.026
Well, I paid for it.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.200
How?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.572
I used my C.D.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.074
How'd you get
access to your C.D.?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.370
I called Vince.
Oh.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.540
You called my office
without talking to me.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.248
I made a reservation for us.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.045
Well, cancel it.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.291
I want to go.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.551
Have you been
to see Dr. Lesser?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.470
Maybe this has something to
do with that hormonal thing.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.674
I am not crazy, Arnold!

10:31.756 --> 10:32.973
Well, then I don't
know what to say to you.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.426
In all our years together,
never have I...

10:34.509 --> 10:36.227
Have you heard me
ask for anything?

10:36.302 --> 10:39.431
Excuse me? Did we not just get a new
refrigerator because you wanted...

10:39.514 --> 10:40.982
That's not what I mean.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.985
Well, you're a grown woman.
You can go anywhere you want to go.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.403
But I'm not going.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.074
So if you want to go to intensive
couples counseling all by yourself,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.571
I'll see you when you get back.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.651
Maybe I will.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.951
All right.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.909
Maybe I will.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.831
You're not going to
get audited over $217.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.046
Well, you're just not.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.299
All right! Call Terri
to make an appointment.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.384
Yes, and thank you. Bye.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.353
You know, Kay called me.
I meant to tell you.

11:18.428 --> 11:22.854
That's nothing. She's just been
acting kind of off, is all.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.401
Off? How? I don't Know.
Threatening me.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.399
What does she want? Car?
Vacation, something?

11:27.478 --> 11:30.027
No. Yeah, a vacation.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.735
I'll tell you, when Susan
used to threaten me,

11:32.817 --> 11:34.114
I did what we all want to do.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.741
Head up to Brewsky's, not call,

11:35.820 --> 11:38.369
come home late piss drunk,
a big "screw you."

11:39.282 --> 11:41.250
You see how that worked out.
Uh-huh.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.543
If I had to do it again,

11:42.619 --> 11:46.715
I'd be on it with flowers, a card,
dinner, maybe even a necklace.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.338
I'd be in there like the Orkin
Man and kill that thing dead.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.090
Maybe then I
wouldn't be in a condo.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.530
The girl
liked those best.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.245
I told her how much
you liked the ocean.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.584
This is your boarding pass.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.912
Oh, come on.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.667
The flight leaves at
10:02 in the morning.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.840
What is wrong with you?
What are you trying to do to us?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.127
I want a real
marriage again, Arnold.

12:32.335 --> 12:36.090
A real marriage? This isn't real
after 31 years? This isn't real?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.470
When's the last time
that you touched me

12:38.549 --> 12:39.926
that wasn't just for a picture?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.854
When's the last time
you kissed me?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.351
I kiss you every day.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.313
We're not 22 years old
anymore, things change.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.320
I could be more...
You know. I could...

12:59.570 --> 13:01.664
Um, this is insane.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.373
The flight leaves at 10:02 tomorrow.
I'm going to be on it.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.167
Your supper's on the table.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.416
You're not even...
You're not even gonna...

13:14.210 --> 13:15.302
Aren't...

17:14.200 --> 17:15.667
I'll set the alarm.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.211
I wouldn't give us
too much extra time.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.506
It's probably impossible to
get lost in a burg this size.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.882
Mmm.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.464
Well...
Well...

17:26.546 --> 17:28.173
We, we could...

17:29.757 --> 17:32.806
I guess I'll go see
how the pull-out works.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.307
Uh...

17:40.226 --> 17:44.026
Goddamn! How is this
thing supposed to...

17:44.105 --> 17:45.482
I'll do it.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.484
I'll do it.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.282
You think there's a building in this
place that does not have shutters?

17:50.361 --> 17:52.580
The whole town looks like it was
built by Hansel and Gretel.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.373
I think it's charming.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.540
That's what they
want you to think.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.493
You think he did it on purpose?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.124
Picking the most
remote possible...

17:59.203 --> 18:01.251
I mean, you're trapped here.
It's like Alcatraz.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.503
Maybe he just wanted people
to have to get away.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.678
From what? Cell phone service?
I don't even have one bar.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.306
Think you can get a decent plate
of eggs anywhere in this zip code?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.384
Oh, there's a...
That little place looks sweet.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.434
Oh, that place?

18:14.510 --> 18:17.309
I guarantee you that place does not
serve breakfast for under $10.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.731
You're a captive audience here.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.101
We're only here for a week.
It's like an airport.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.319
We might as well try... A week?
I'll be bankrupt in a week.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.067
Let's go. Come on.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.408
Coffee to start?

18:29.525 --> 18:31.072
Yes. Please.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.996
Is there anything on this menu
that doesn't have lobster in it?

18:34.071 --> 18:35.072
Oh.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.246
See, there are your eggs.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.793
And, look, they have
a breakfast special.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.124
What's special about $11.75?

18:41.203 --> 18:43.581
All right, I'm going to have
a side of two eggs,

18:43.664 --> 18:45.166
sunny side up,
and a side of bacon, crisp.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.967
I'll just give you the special.
It comes with the...

18:47.043 --> 18:49.546
Nope.
The special's $1 more.

18:49.879 --> 18:50.880
And for you?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.842
Yes. I'm just going to have the
fruit and cottage cheese plate.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.143
I have a nervous stomach.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.271
And we're in a tiny
bit of a hurry because...

18:59.347 --> 19:03.022
You got the 10:30 with Bernie.
We'll get you there on time.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.443
Good luck.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.319
There it is.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.775
On, nice digs.

19:10.858 --> 19:11.825
Yeah.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.153
Mmm-hmm.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.743
If he says one word about
repressed memories, I am leaving.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.501
Kay and Arnold,
I'm so glad you're here.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.249
Well, that makes one of us.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.333
Hmm.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.045
So, Arnold, I take it intensive
therapy was not your idea.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.592
Nope!

19:33.047 --> 19:34.264
You wanted to come?

19:34.632 --> 19:35.679
Yes.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.055
All right.
And Arnold, you?

19:37.134 --> 19:39.182
I thought she was nuts.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.936
We're not in the same tax
bracket as your other patients.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.434
I think you'd be surprised.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.485
Well, even if we were,
all due respect.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.404
I really don't
see the point here.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.738
So, you think there's nothing
wrong with your marriage.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.036
Well, we've been married
31 years, isn't it?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.620
It's not perfect.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.626
But in your opinion,
it works well enough.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.456
But you wanted to come.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.884
You persuaded Arnold?

20:09.959 --> 20:12.178
No. I mean, I paid for it.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.349
With my own money,
from savings.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.509
All right. So this is
really important to you.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.932
Mmm-hmm.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.725
Tell me why.

20:23.139 --> 20:27.610
I want to have
a marriage again.

20:27.685 --> 20:28.732
Again?

20:28.811 --> 20:31.109
If we don't have a marriage,
I don't know who does.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.658
Arnold. Let's let Kay talk
and you can respond after.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.278
Okay. Fine. "Again"

20:39.321 --> 20:40.618
Arnold used to touch me.

20:40.698 --> 20:41.824
Oh, God.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.957
Not just... You know,

20:47.204 --> 20:50.708
but he would touch my arm
or my shoulder, just to...

20:52.042 --> 20:54.966
Just to, I don't know,
because he wanted to.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.589
And now he doesn't?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.303
And that bothers you.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.354
Do you touch him?

21:05.222 --> 21:07.725
Not really.
He doesn't like it.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.354
Is she right, Arnold?
Do you like it when she touches you?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.147
I don't know.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.115
You don't know?
I don't think about it.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.781
All right.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.371
What else, Kay?

21:24.450 --> 21:30.207
Well, it feels like we live in
the house together like two...

21:31.957 --> 21:34.551
Like two workers
who bunk in the same room.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.553
Except we don't...
We're not in the same room,

21:39.632 --> 21:42.226
but it just feels
like there's nothing

21:42.301 --> 21:45.020
holding us together
except the house.

21:45.095 --> 21:47.348
Nothing holding us together
like 31 years of...

21:48.307 --> 21:49.308
Of what, Arnold?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.734
Marriage.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.529
What does that
word mean to you?

21:53.604 --> 21:56.073
Means we have a marriage license
and I pay all the bills.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.492
Not to mention our two grown...

21:59.485 --> 22:00.907
You really have lost your mind.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.332
Let's try to keep the conversation
descriptive and positive.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.036
Kay, please continue.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.373
Um...

22:14.124 --> 22:16.001
We don't talk about anything.

22:16.085 --> 22:19.055
Talk! What is there
I don't know about you?

22:19.129 --> 22:20.756
About Eileen and
the skirts she bought

22:20.840 --> 22:24.219
or if she took back the little
necklace with the tiki gods.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.518
Jesus Christ.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.438
No, I don't mean...
I just mean, I don't...

22:30.891 --> 22:34.862
I don't tell Arnold how
I feel about anything.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.691
And I don't know how he feels
about anything either.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.697
I'll tell you how I feel
about this, I hate it.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.653
All right. This is good.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.783
Good. Yeah.
Good for you.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.198
The more we tear
each other apart,

22:45.281 --> 22:47.033
the more money we have to pay
you to put it back together.

22:47.116 --> 22:51.246
Jesus God.
You people are worse than lawyers.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.419
I understand how you feel.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.841
Yeah?

22:55.916 --> 22:59.045
You two have come here to try to
restore intimacy to your marriage.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.926
So that is going to be the goal

23:01.005 --> 23:02.928
of our very focused
sessions together.

23:03.007 --> 23:06.102
To find ways to communicate
your needs to one another.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.099
To cultivate intimacy.

23:08.178 --> 23:12.274
And to develop the tools to sustain
that intimacy going forward.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.444
The first step in
rebuilding a marriage

23:19.523 --> 23:22.322
is tearing away
some of the scar tissue

23:22.401 --> 23:23.903
that has built up
over the years.

23:24.361 --> 23:27.035
It can be very painful,
but it's worth it.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.491
I like to think of it...

23:28.574 --> 23:34.001
The metaphor of when you have a
deviated septum and you can't breathe?

23:34.872 --> 23:38.046
You have to break the nose
in order to fix it.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.632
Charlatan!

23:44.715 --> 23:47.264
No, he's worse than a charlatan.
He's like one of those...

23:48.385 --> 23:50.638
Says he's "honed his method."
The only thing he's honed

23:50.721 --> 23:52.769
is making sure that
if you don't walk in

23:52.848 --> 23:54.441
with
a marriage-destroying problem,

23:54.516 --> 23:56.439
you won't leave without one.

23:56.518 --> 24:00.489
He's like those moisturizing eye
drops that make your eyes dry.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.317
$4,000. That could
have been a new roof!

24:03.651 --> 24:06.780
Did you look at his credentials or
even read that brochure that you...

24:06.862 --> 24:07.909
I mean, my God!

24:08.030 --> 24:11.204
Unbelievable! I'd like to have a
look at this guy's tax returns.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.535
Whoo-hoo.

24:13.035 --> 24:17.085
Oh, don't.
Come on, just don't.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.963
You have to stop yelling at me.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.545
I'm not yelling!
Who's yelling?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.050
Hey. Welcome back.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.302
I'll have an Arnold
Palmer and a tuna melt.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.805
You sure you're
ready to commit?

24:30.552 --> 24:32.099
I'll have the soup
and salad, please.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.726
Okey-dokey.

24:35.307 --> 24:39.904
$9 for a tuna melt, it's canned
tuna, a slab of cheese and toast.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.107
Feld's probably
getting kickbacks.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.486
I saw a grocery store
near the motel.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.821
We can buy some cold cuts,
eat in the room.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.906
Are you guys here for Bernie?

24:51.365 --> 24:53.584
Mmm-hmm.
We come back every year.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.002
For a tune-up.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.458
Oh.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.583
In case you're wondering,
we are never coming back.

25:02.918 --> 25:07.298
I mean, if I had ever said so
much as even one unkind word...

25:07.381 --> 25:09.759
Do you want the hard salami
or do you want this kind here?

25:09.842 --> 25:10.889
I don't care.

25:10.968 --> 25:11.969
I mean, my brother, Ralph,

25:12.094 --> 25:14.768
if Angela had ever taken him
to one of these things, whew.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.021
You. I just hope you
remember this next year

25:18.100 --> 25:20.353
when you want to tell me that
I never help and I never...

25:20.436 --> 25:22.404
I'm getting the Limburger,
you don't have to eat it.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.901
And I'll tell you one thing,

25:23.981 --> 25:26.860
we're going to go to Florida and see my
mother next year for the full two weeks.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.570
You have forfeited
your right to complain.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.530
Oh, boy! I was thinking
about you the whole...

25:31.613 --> 25:34.287
Get away from the door!
I'm getting!

25:38.162 --> 25:39.288
What happened to you?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.339
I had to do that thing
and the handle came off

25:41.415 --> 25:44.840
Oh, me, too! And it broke,
and that kid, he played bad.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.300
It was a course
at the university.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.544
Beginning Accounting.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.347
And Arnold was
the teaching assistant.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.220
What was your first impression
of Kay, Arnold?

26:32.299 --> 26:35.348
She was pretty.
Very pretty.

26:35.761 --> 26:36.762
What else?

26:36.845 --> 26:39.473
She probably shouldn't
major in accounting.

26:42.851 --> 26:46.572
And Thanksgiving passed,
no ring,

26:47.022 --> 26:50.492
and my dad said, "Well, you
picked the wrong horse."

26:51.026 --> 26:53.028
But two days later, I found it.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.116
He had hidden it,
the ring, in a cinnamon bun.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.167
I was so surprised.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.790
What was holding
you up, Arnold?

27:00.869 --> 27:04.089
Well,
it's not like buying a car.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.344
And that winter,
Arnold threw his back out.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.424
I was helping Brad
paint his room and...

27:14.508 --> 27:17.557
He said he would be more
comfortable sleeping alone.

27:17.678 --> 27:18.975
That hurt like
a son of a bitch.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.682
But then, his back got better.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.767
It still bothers me
a little bit. But also I...

27:23.851 --> 27:24.977
He snores.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.983
I have that sleep apnea deal.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.360
So he just stayed in the
guest room after that.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.691
Yeah.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.739
Did you ask him to come back?

27:33.861 --> 27:36.489
NO. I didn't think he'd...

27:38.490 --> 27:39.742
No.

27:40.284 --> 27:41.376
Hmm.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.246
So it's been a long time since
you've slept in the same room.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.883
When was the last
time you had sex?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.428
Yeah.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.136
Uh, I have no idea.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.764
Well, let's try
to think about it.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.276
It was four years ago, almost
five years ago. In September.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.787
When Brad moved out
after college.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.285
September 22nd.
I remember thinking,

28:19.364 --> 28:22.868
"He's moving out on
the first day of fall."

28:22.951 --> 28:24.703
We get the picture, okay?

28:24.786 --> 28:26.914
This makes you uncomfortable
talking about this, doesn't it?

28:26.997 --> 28:28.749
Well, sue me because
I don't want to talk

28:28.832 --> 28:31.210
about having sex with my wife
with a total stranger.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.966
You want to talk
about it at all?

28:39.635 --> 28:42.138
What else do you remember
about that day, Kay?

28:42.596 --> 28:44.473
How'd you make love?

28:44.598 --> 28:45.850
How?

28:45.974 --> 28:49.444
Was it the missionary position?
Arnold on top?

28:49.519 --> 28:50.736
Oh, yeah.

28:50.812 --> 28:51.813
Was it always
missionary position?

28:51.897 --> 28:52.898
Oh, please.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.904
Mostly, yes. Mmm-hmm.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.321
Were there particular things
that you enjoyed doing?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.497
Mostly it was the same.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.920
Was your sex life
satisfying for you?

29:06.995 --> 29:08.588
Well, it was fine.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.711
Yeah. All right.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.085
Okay.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.472
I would like to assign
you your first exercise.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.966
What... What kind of...

29:19.049 --> 29:20.767
Tonight, I would like you
to spend a period of time

29:20.842 --> 29:22.344
with your arms
around one another.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.519
wen, whats the... why?

29:27.015 --> 29:31.145
Because I want you to remember what
it's like to touch each other.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.568
Do you think you can do that?

29:34.731 --> 29:35.732
Arnold?

29:35.816 --> 29:37.818
Well, maybe that's what...

29:37.901 --> 29:40.029
I mean, forced intimacy...
Is that really...

29:40.112 --> 29:41.113
It's not forced intimacy.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.823
That's what it sounds like.
Oh...

29:42.948 --> 29:45.292
- What? We're supposed to be truthful here.
- You are.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.959
Although... So what I'm saying is
that I don't think this exercise,

29:49.037 --> 29:51.290
or whatever you wanna call it,
sounds like something...

29:51.373 --> 29:52.875
It's not forced.
If I do that

29:52.958 --> 29:54.926
just because somebody tells
me to, what is the point?

29:55.002 --> 29:58.802
I don't think I like the idea
of anybody telling me...

29:58.880 --> 30:03.306
I mean, the whole idea of this exercise
thing is totally ridiculous to me.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.558
I'm not a trained monkey!

30:05.679 --> 30:07.272
You're a bully!
What?

30:07.389 --> 30:11.019
Since you got here, all you've
done is make me feel...

30:11.101 --> 30:12.102
Kay? Kay.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.903

I went to the museum.

33:34.304 --> 33:35.305
Did you?

33:35.388 --> 33:36.435
Was it interesting?

33:36.515 --> 33:37.687
Extremely.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.185
Of course, if you want to go,
you'll have to do it on your own.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.369
Oh.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.125
Just around.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.170
I thought you
wanted to do that thing.

34:02.290 --> 34:05.510
But if you don't want to
do it, I sure don't care.

34:06.628 --> 34:09.005
All right, I'll just go to bed.

34:09.505 --> 34:10.803
I want to do it.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.393
I guess we should do it there.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.438
Mmm-hmm.

34:42.998 --> 34:47.344
Well, I guess I'll get in.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.778
Maybe this is enough.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.714
Yeah, probably enough.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.899
I was just getting the light.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.888
And then we did the exercise...

36:58.967 --> 37:00.890
Yeah, that was...

37:00.969 --> 37:01.970
And we woke up.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.054
Yeah.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.315
And we were in the same bed.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.434
Yeah, it was...

37:07.517 --> 37:09.645
It was comfortable.
Yep.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.779
This is good.
Really good.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.578
By taking some
time to yourselves,

37:18.653 --> 37:21.076
you were able to
relate better as a couple.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.578
And you both did it
without even trying.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.125
Well, she wanted
to spend time apart.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.372
Yeah. I was so mad.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.329
Mad as a wet cat.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.631
But, you know, it was
nice, wasn't it?

37:30.707 --> 37:33.335
To do something on
your own, you know.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.470
Great, you two.
Really great.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.513
I'm thrilled with the
progress that you've made.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.762
And I think it's going to
make it that much easier

37:39.841 --> 37:41.718
to proceed to the next step.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.470
Next step. That's great.
Let's get with it.

37:43.553 --> 37:46.397
I mean, we're doing so well, we might
be able to get out of here early.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.100
Okay, next step.
What is it?

37:48.183 --> 37:50.902
Write a poem? Hold hands in public?
Sing a Serenade?

37:51.186 --> 37:52.654
Sex.

37:55.565 --> 37:58.990
We're going to talk extensively
about your sexual history.

37:59.068 --> 38:02.163
When it started. What it included.
What it didn't include.

38:02.947 --> 38:06.121
If you had orgasms,
vaginally or otherwise.

38:06.868 --> 38:10.498
If you had issues around
sexuality or performance.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.463
Whether you talked
about sex or during it.

38:14.542 --> 38:15.794
What your fantasies are.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.671
If you ever acted on fantasies.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.927
Brought toys or sex games
into the bedroom.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.804
Brought sex out of the bedroom.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.385
And once we've explored
all of those things,

38:23.468 --> 38:25.141
I will give you
your first sexual,

38:25.220 --> 38:27.473
not sex, but sexual, exercise.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.401
All right?

38:32.602 --> 38:34.354
Let's get started.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.065
Arnold,
would you like to begin?

38:38.900 --> 38:40.652
Do you...

38:41.194 --> 38:44.198
I think we ought to stop
this right now before...

38:44.280 --> 38:46.874
We should just get
our things and go.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.583
I'll go first. I will.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.126
Fine.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.878
Terrific.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.258
All right.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.638
Kay, let's talk about
what you liked sexually.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.278
Was intercourse
pleasurable for you?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.611
Sometimes.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.076
Did you have orgasms?

39:24.821 --> 39:26.289
Sometimes.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.783
- Do you masturbate?
- No.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.376
Not anymore.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.253
Why not?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.296
Because at a certain point,
I just...

39:35.582 --> 39:40.429
I think I didn't want to think
about sex or about Arnold, even.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.968
It just made me sad thinking
about what I missed and...

39:50.179 --> 39:52.432
What about your fantasy life?

39:54.183 --> 39:55.560
Do you have fantasies?

39:55.643 --> 39:56.895
Mmm-hmm.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.189
What?

40:01.316 --> 40:05.366
My fantasy is that, you
know, we'll renew our vows.

40:07.322 --> 40:11.543
Just a little small ceremony,
on a beach, maybe.

40:11.618 --> 40:12.870
Right.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.587
Maybe with the kids there.

40:15.914 --> 40:20.010
Right. And do you
have sexual fantasies?

40:23.963 --> 40:25.681
Imagine scenarios?

40:26.925 --> 40:31.271
Having sex on a mountain top
or dressed all in leather?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.686
That's funny.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.396
So, no.

40:39.604 --> 40:43.199
I mainly think about Arnold
and things that we've done.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.243
You never have fantasies
about things that

40:50.323 --> 40:52.576
you haven't done ever?

40:53.409 --> 40:54.661
No.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.507
No.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.217
Okay. Okay.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.309
All right. Arnold,
let's talk about you.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.021
What do you enjoy sexually?

41:17.100 --> 41:18.101
Sex.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.982
I'm going to ask you
to get more specific.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.438
Okay, fine.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.990
So you enjoy the actual sexual act?
Intercourse?

41:24.065 --> 41:25.191
Yeah.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.493
Missionary style.

41:29.570 --> 41:32.574
Would you prefer that
to, say, oral sex?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.586
I guess so.

41:37.370 --> 41:40.089
Was oral sex an option?
Ls that something that you would do regularly?

41:40.164 --> 41:43.088
No, I, I, I, I don't... No.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.135
I was not very... I'm...

41:45.211 --> 41:47.930
I was not
comfortable with that.

41:49.382 --> 41:50.929
Giving or receiving?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.140
Huh?

41:55.179 --> 41:58.023
Um, I don't know.
Both, I guess.

41:58.307 --> 42:01.686
Okay. So, now you, Arnold,
would have been open to that.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.364
What does it matter?
She just said it was not an option.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.783
What about
problems in the bedroom?

42:07.275 --> 42:10.370
Have you ever experienced
erectile dysfunction?

42:10.445 --> 42:12.368
No.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.120
Use medications like Viagra?

42:14.198 --> 42:15.199
No.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.452
As we age,
sometimes, it becomes...

42:17.910 --> 42:19.253
It works.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.633
What would you say
was working in your sex life

42:23.750 --> 42:25.377
when you were sexual together?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.633
For instance, would you climax?
Yeah.

42:28.254 --> 42:31.133
Were there things that you
wanted to do, but didn't?

42:32.175 --> 42:33.973
You're kidding, right?

42:34.635 --> 42:36.012
Well?

42:36.137 --> 42:37.354
I mean, who says no to that?

42:37.764 --> 42:39.391
Right. Then go ahead.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.976
Uh, what,
you want a whole list?

42:41.142 --> 42:42.359
Sure.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.236
Uh...

42:51.486 --> 42:54.285
I'm not really
coming up with anything.

42:55.823 --> 42:58.201
There are no
wrong answers here.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.291
Well...

43:05.416 --> 43:07.089
If you could have
anything you wanted

43:07.168 --> 43:09.136
in your sex life with Kay,
what would that be?

43:11.756 --> 43:16.227
Did you have fantasies that you didn't
feel comfortable telling her about?

43:16.302 --> 43:17.554
Of course.

43:21.015 --> 43:25.145
Well, I guess I used to think
about Kay giving me a...

43:31.067 --> 43:33.411
Giving me oral...

43:34.862 --> 43:36.330
You know...

43:37.698 --> 43:40.201
At work.
Under the desk.

43:41.869 --> 43:43.337
At tax time.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.340
So, public places.

43:46.415 --> 43:48.088
No, not just public places.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.716
No? Okay.
Good, good. Very good.

43:54.757 --> 43:55.974
What else?

43:57.552 --> 43:59.850
A threesome.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.938
With?
The neighbor.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.477
Helen?

44:06.269 --> 44:07.486
No, Carol.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.314
Carol?

44:10.731 --> 44:12.529
Carol with the corgis?

44:18.656 --> 44:20.954
Very good, Arnold.
Both of you.

44:22.827 --> 44:25.797
I am going to give you
your next exercise.

44:28.291 --> 44:31.170
You think we ought to
be sitting for this?

44:31.544 --> 44:32.761
Well,

44:35.423 --> 44:37.300
maybe lying down.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.110
You want to go first?

44:48.644 --> 44:50.442
Do you want me to?

44:51.105 --> 44:52.698
Six of one,
half dozen of the other.

45:09.749 --> 45:11.751
Is that all right?
Fine.

45:18.633 --> 45:20.055
Does it feel good?

45:20.134 --> 45:22.683
It feels like
you're petting a dog.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.241
That tickles. Don't...

45:43.324 --> 45:44.291
Sorry. Okay.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.461
Don't go there.
I'm sorry.

45:54.835 --> 45:57.258
I really don't
see the point of...

45:58.381 --> 46:00.383
I mean, this Dr. Feld...

46:00.466 --> 46:01.683
Mmm-hmm.

46:02.176 --> 46:06.352
You think he has other legitimate
doctors here who agree with him,

46:07.682 --> 46:11.778
or think he could be
just some sort of a renegade?

46:16.190 --> 46:20.536
You, I mean, well, us,

46:21.195 --> 46:25.792
your average person, you could be being
treated by someone who's psychotic.

46:27.952 --> 46:34.335
Or maybe someone
who's just a very average,

46:36.585 --> 46:39.464
or even
below-average practitioner.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.396
Uh...

46:55.646 --> 46:57.239
I think we better stop.

46:57.356 --> 46:58.824
What?

47:01.110 --> 47:03.659
You sure?
Yeah, I think I just...

47:07.074 --> 47:08.747
I'm going to bed.

48:24.485 --> 48:28.865
So, last night you had
the touching exercise.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.205
How did that go?

48:35.830 --> 48:37.423
How was that for you?

48:41.961 --> 48:44.714
All right,
let's talk about it. Arnold.

48:45.881 --> 48:47.224
How was it
having Kay touch you?

48:47.299 --> 48:48.300
It was fine, I guess.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.019
Did it feel good?

48:50.469 --> 48:52.312
Did you get aroused?

48:53.514 --> 48:54.982
How did that make you feel?

48:55.057 --> 48:56.400
Aroused.

48:56.684 --> 48:58.652
What about you, Kay?
How did that make you feel?

48:59.019 --> 49:00.646
Oh, l got aroused, too.

49:00.729 --> 49:01.776
Did you know that, Arnold?

49:01.856 --> 49:05.451
How am I supposed to know what
she's thinking or feeling?

49:07.278 --> 49:09.701
How was it for you, Kay,
when Arnold touched you?

49:09.780 --> 49:11.874
Oh, we didn't get to that part.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.075
Why not? Why?

49:13.159 --> 49:15.878
Because we just stopped.

49:16.537 --> 49:18.835
We did the exercise.
It was done. We did it.

49:18.914 --> 49:22.544
The exercise was to spend a period of
time touching each other sensually.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.470
It sounds like Kay touched
you and then you stopped.

49:25.546 --> 49:27.389
Did you talk about it?

49:28.466 --> 49:29.683
Whose idea was it to stop?

49:29.758 --> 49:32.853
It was mine, okay.
I just wanted to stop. I wanted...

49:32.970 --> 49:34.972
All right. Okay.
I didn't want to do it anymore.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.649
All right.
Well, let's go deeper, then.

49:37.725 --> 49:38.817
Let's not go deeper.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.987
It's not enough to just be here.
You have to try.

49:41.061 --> 49:44.941
I'm not trying? I flew 1,500 miles
up here for this and I'm not trying?

49:45.024 --> 49:47.026
All right. Well, then, let's
just try to figure this out.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.281
Why did you want Kay to stop?

49:48.360 --> 49:49.828
I wanted her to stop because...

49:51.322 --> 49:52.323
Were you afraid?

49:52.406 --> 49:54.408
No! What do I
have to be afraid of?

49:54.533 --> 49:57.002
Fear... Hey, re-engaging can be...
I'm not afraid of my own wife.

49:57.077 --> 50:00.001
Fine. Well, that's okay. It's okay.
It's normal to feel fear.

50:00.080 --> 50:01.172
I did not feel fear!

50:01.248 --> 50:03.091
Then why did you stop Kay
from touching you?

50:03.167 --> 50:04.168
Let me tell you something.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.628
I am done with this for today.

50:05.711 --> 50:06.758
I am done.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.589
I'll see you back at the room.

51:09.817 --> 51:10.989
Kay?

51:14.989 --> 51:16.787
What are you doing?

51:16.865 --> 51:19.664
Dr. Feld said
he'd give us a refund.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.666
What percent?

51:23.455 --> 51:24.422
What?

51:24.498 --> 51:27.923
Did he say he'd give us back
the whole payment, or...

51:29.003 --> 51:30.676
Half.
Half.

51:33.716 --> 51:35.718
I don't know what you thought
was going to happen here.

51:35.801 --> 51:37.474
What did you...

51:37.970 --> 51:40.894
I mean, there's no
magic pill or wand or...

51:40.973 --> 51:42.099
He's just a guy with an office.

51:42.182 --> 51:43.183
Mmm-hmm.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.395
It's ridiculous.
You come up here, you spend one week

51:45.477 --> 51:48.981
and you're supposed to, what,
have a new marriage?

51:49.440 --> 51:52.239
It's a setup.
You're set up for failure.

51:53.235 --> 51:56.034
Then you feel bad about failing.
You see that, right?

51:57.406 --> 51:58.953
You can't win.

52:04.204 --> 52:05.706
Why the hell did
you bring us here?

52:08.667 --> 52:11.591
You know how you think you're
always headed towards something?

52:11.670 --> 52:15.095
You think, "When we get married
," or, "When we have kids,"

52:15.174 --> 52:18.553
or, "When the kids go
and it's just us again..."

52:21.889 --> 52:25.359
You know, there's always
something to look forward to.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.781
And one day, I realized that we are
not going towards anything anymore.

52:30.898 --> 52:32.946
And I guess I was
just not willing

52:33.025 --> 52:35.619
to let go of things
getting better anymore.

52:37.029 --> 52:38.406
Not yet.

52:38.572 --> 52:41.701
Maybe you just
don't get a choice,

52:42.951 --> 52:44.203
you know?

52:44.286 --> 52:45.378
Maybe you just
don't get a choice.

52:45.454 --> 52:48.583
Don't forget your
razor in the bathroom.

52:52.461 --> 52:53.883
You're back.

52:54.463 --> 52:56.261
- Let's talk about that.
- Let's not.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.934
Let's just... I'm back, all right?
That ought to be enough.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.511
It isn't, actually.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.471
What do you want
from me, blood?

53:02.596 --> 53:05.019
You have a lot
of anger, Arnold.

53:05.099 --> 53:06.521
What do you think
you're so angry about?

53:06.600 --> 53:09.023
I'm angry about everything.
I'm angry about being here.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.322
Why? What are you
afraid will happen?

53:11.397 --> 53:13.900
You want to know what? Fine.

53:14.441 --> 53:15.784
What I'm afraid
will happen here

53:15.859 --> 53:18.328
is what probably happens in every
goddamn therapist's office

53:18.445 --> 53:20.368
every time any poor
couple goes in there.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.916
You say whatever thing,
because somebody like you

53:22.991 --> 53:25.494
is dragging it out of them and
then you can't take it back.

53:25.577 --> 53:28.831
There are things in this life
that you don't say for a reason.

53:28.914 --> 53:30.336
Like what?
What would you say?

53:31.333 --> 53:32.459
Uh...

53:34.545 --> 53:35.762
Tell me.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.804
I want to know.
I want to know.

53:40.634 --> 53:43.228
It's worse not knowing when there
are things that you're holding back

53:43.303 --> 53:45.397
you won't say because you think
I'm too fragile or whatever.

53:45.472 --> 53:47.315
No, it's not that. It's...

53:47.391 --> 53:49.064
Something I can't hear.

53:49.143 --> 53:51.066
All right, fine!
All right.

53:53.313 --> 53:54.815
She has a way...
Say it to Kay.

53:55.482 --> 53:59.532
You have a way of saying
that something's up to me

53:59.611 --> 54:01.739
and then when I make a decision

54:01.822 --> 54:02.869
and it's something
you don't like,

54:02.948 --> 54:04.245
you don't actually
say anything,

54:04.324 --> 54:06.076
but you sure do get
your point across.

54:06.160 --> 54:09.289
Well, can I just say, I don't like...
ls it my turn?

54:10.664 --> 54:13.417
I don't like the way
that we always do

54:13.500 --> 54:16.344
something for Christmas,
or an anniversary,

54:16.420 --> 54:20.300
that's a joint gift for the
house, like a water heater.

54:20.382 --> 54:21.429
You needed that water heater.

54:21.508 --> 54:24.136
Yes, but you did, too.
You shower.

54:24.303 --> 54:26.556
Why is that
a special gift for me?

54:27.097 --> 54:28.098
Hmm?

54:28.182 --> 54:31.937
And I hate watching golf.
I do. I think it's boring.

54:32.311 --> 54:35.155
And the shows where they
talk about golf, even worse.

54:35.230 --> 54:37.733
It's like being
married to ESPN.

54:39.026 --> 54:41.779
And when you eat ranch chips,
your breath smells.

54:41.862 --> 54:43.614
I like ranch chips.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.707
And I hate it when
you rub up against me,

54:45.783 --> 54:48.286
like you just
expect me to do it.

54:48.368 --> 54:49.620
"Come on, let's go."

54:49.703 --> 54:52.126
Hell, it got to the point I was
afraid to make any kind of move.

54:52.206 --> 54:54.129
If I even so much as
tried to kiss you...

54:54.208 --> 54:56.336
Well, you never Kiss me.

54:56.877 --> 54:59.756
You don't want to kiss me,
you just want "it."

54:59.838 --> 55:01.090
Not me.

55:01.715 --> 55:05.720
You know, he always has
his eyes squeezed tight shut.

55:10.224 --> 55:12.477
It's not me.
You just want "it."

55:12.559 --> 55:16.314
Hell, yes, I want "it.
" You can bet your life I want "it."

55:16.396 --> 55:19.525
So screw me for wanting
to have sex with my wife!

55:20.150 --> 55:23.074
And, you know,
it's not pleasant

55:24.238 --> 55:26.366
to do that with somebody
who doesn't want to do it.

55:28.534 --> 55:30.411
But you never saw me...

55:32.079 --> 55:33.422
What?

55:34.248 --> 55:35.420
Go on, Arnold.

55:35.499 --> 55:37.718
I didn't complain
because Kay didn't want sex.

55:38.085 --> 55:41.009
Love. That's what I wanted.
Not just sex.

55:42.256 --> 55:43.883
I wanted you.

55:44.842 --> 55:47.846
Well, what about all those
years I wanted you?

55:48.136 --> 55:50.559
All those goddamn years.

55:54.226 --> 55:56.069
And I didn't cheat.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.321
I didn't go to hookers.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.691
I watched a little porn,
but who doesn't?

56:00.941 --> 56:03.569
I was good.
I did the right thing.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.163
Now you're
bringing me here for...

56:10.742 --> 56:13.916
You're the one
who stopped, not me.

56:15.873 --> 56:19.218
Yeah, for a while I stopped,
yes, but you stopped, too.

56:19.626 --> 56:22.129
You did. You stopped.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.557
Well, you don't just turn
it on and off, you know?

56:26.633 --> 56:29.136
Maybe when it's off,
it's just off.

56:34.975 --> 56:36.022
Off.

56:44.985 --> 56:46.987
I want you to do
something for me.

56:48.238 --> 56:50.536
I want you to tell me about
the best sex you ever had.

56:51.408 --> 56:55.003
The time that you can remember
that was the best. Either of you.

56:55.120 --> 56:58.499
Even if it wasn't very good.
Even if it was terrible.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.550
Best time that you remember.

57:04.630 --> 57:05.882
Well...

57:06.757 --> 57:07.849
Hmm.

57:08.425 --> 57:09.472
Oh.

57:09.551 --> 57:12.020
I remember one time.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.019
Kay was pregnant.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.776
Where were you?
In the kitchen.

57:19.603 --> 57:21.105
She was making soup.

57:21.188 --> 57:25.568
And I came in there and she kept
saying she had to stir her soup.

57:27.194 --> 57:30.198
And pretty soon,
she forgot about that soup.

57:31.031 --> 57:32.499
What do you remember, Kay?

57:35.619 --> 57:39.340
Well,
we were on the floor, and...

57:44.086 --> 57:45.838
And it was slow.

57:53.512 --> 57:57.562
He... He put some dish towels
behind my heed

57:57.641 --> 57:59.143
so my head wouldn't bang on...

57:59.226 --> 58:02.480
Wouldn't bump up against
the bottom of the cabinet.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.907
That was...

58:10.654 --> 58:13.373
Arnold, what else
do you remember about that?

58:14.574 --> 58:16.247
Just wanting her.

58:18.078 --> 58:20.922
Just wanting her.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.087
Standing there in the kitchen.

58:27.838 --> 58:29.090
Happy.

58:30.465 --> 58:32.012
Beautiful.

58:33.635 --> 58:38.391
She had a little apron which was
getting to be too little because her

58:40.434 --> 58:42.528
belly was getting so big.

58:43.437 --> 58:45.610
You were very
attracted to her then.

58:46.481 --> 58:48.529
Yeah, I was, and...

58:48.608 --> 58:50.235
Are you still?

58:51.820 --> 58:55.791
Uh, I don't...
I don't know.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.619
It's been along
time since we've...

58:58.702 --> 59:00.704
I don't look like I did then.

59:00.787 --> 59:01.879
No, it's not that.

59:01.955 --> 59:04.003
No. I never could
lose all the weight.

59:04.082 --> 59:08.553
You look fine. I just don't think
of it in that way anymore.

59:08.837 --> 59:10.259
About her that way anymore.

59:10.422 --> 59:12.720
Well, of course, I...

59:12.799 --> 59:15.177
No,
it's not "of course."

59:15.594 --> 59:17.642
Sometimes when
a connection is lost,

59:17.721 --> 59:19.940
we forget how to
want one another.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.144
Do you still want Kay?

59:25.645 --> 59:27.067
Well, yes!

59:27.147 --> 59:28.524
Do you still
fantasize about her?

59:30.025 --> 59:32.244
You mean, now?

59:35.906 --> 59:37.203
These days.

59:38.325 --> 59:39.451
I don't know.

59:39.826 --> 59:41.453
I don't... I...

59:44.122 --> 59:45.499
I had one.

59:48.335 --> 59:49.712
I had a fantasy.

59:54.508 --> 59:56.010
Was it...

59:56.635 --> 59:57.761
It was...

59:57.844 --> 59:59.687
It was... It was...

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:06.353
Like you said.
It was just us,

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:10.782
and it was really different.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.326
Something we've
never done before.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.322
Something new.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.340
I'm going to ask you to take a
leap of faith and try something.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:36.554
It is most likely way out
of your comfort zone.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.353
Try to think of
it in terms of...

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.475
Remember the metaphor
of a nose breaking?

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.026
It's the nose.

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:51.277
Well, you can't break
a nose slowly, can you?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.993
Of course there was a problem
with the popcorn popper.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.122
Oh.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:05.961
Thank you.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:08.131
I don't see why you can't tell
me what you're planning on.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:10.254
Because he said
it was fine this way.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:13.007
It just makes me uncomfortable not to
know what I'm going to be asked to do.

01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.214
When it's your turn,
you can do what you want.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:16.549
What if we don't do
the exercise again?

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:19.976
We're moving at
a rapid clip here. Okay.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:21.519
It's your ball game.

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.061
I'll tell you one thing.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.065
You would never get me into a
French movie if we were at home.

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.246
This is pretty good.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.506
Oh.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.935
Sorry.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.935
I'm sorry, I can't see!

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.694
You just need to take it easy.
Watch it with the teeth!

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.612
I'm sorry.
Sorry, I didn't mean...

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:56.156
It's all right.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.366
I can't see.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.119
Oh, God.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.877
Hey, you can hurt someone!

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.383
I'm so sorry!
I can't do this.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.180
Kay. Kay. Kay.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:23.174
Kay, it's okay.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.510
It's not okay!

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.557
It's not okay.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.059
Kay, listen.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.940
Kay, this is not a big deal.

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.020
I should...

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.855
I should...

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.815
I'm not good at anything.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.491
There's not anything
to be good at!

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:42.490
I don't Know how to
be good at anything.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.612
Listen, wait.
I'm not sexy!

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:46.915
Wait. Yes, you are very...

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.284
What?
What? Yes, what?

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:51.628
Maybe you just don't have...

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:55.708
Maybe there's just certain things
you're not experienced at.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:58.752
Kay!

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.936
I must have looked so stupid!

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.680
But how did you feel?

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:12.933
Like a fake.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.855
I'm just not... I'm...
I just can't do that.

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.861
Well, the whole situation
was just dangerous,

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.783
with those cup holders,
and seat backs going forth,

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.203
and back and forth
and the cramped space,

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:28.031
the concrete floor, those
people everywhere.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:30.207
That's not me.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.537
I just can't be
a person who commits

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.293
an illegal act
in a movie theater.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.968
It's just... Is that
really who I have to be?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.212
It's not about
being a sex object.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:45.765
It's about pleasing the man you love.
And letting him please you.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.763
Well, I don't even
know how to do that!

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:50.265
Ultimately, I think
you have to ask yourself,

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:53.315
"Is this person worth more
to me than my pride'?"

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:55.524
Oh, yeah. I mean...

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:57.481
Yes.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:59.609
Kay's putting it
all on the line here.

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:00.813
What are you
putting on the line?

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.448
Everything.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.735
He is everything.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:10.873
But I'm really lonely.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.536
And I think

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:20.088
to be with somebody
and not really with him is...

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:28.679
I think I might be less
lonely if I were alone.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.349
Do you want to be alone?
No!

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.014
I don't know.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:40.775
You wouldn't think
it would be so hard

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:42.731
to just touch
somebody that you love.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.529
But it is. It's really hard.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.912
Okay. You know what?

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.630
I'm going to give you something

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:07.343
that may help
with your anxiety.

01:06:10.258 --> 01:06:12.477
You can pick this up in town.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.625
Hey.
Hi. Hello.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.465
Oh, we got a discount on trade
paperbacks in the front,

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.838
if you're interested.
Oh.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:46.677
Are you looking
for anything special?

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:47.970
Not really.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:50.174
All right, just let me know.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:57.977
Do you have a title, miss?

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:01.317
No, not... I'm just...

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.982
I was gonna say if you got
a title, I can look it up.

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.530
We're short on
shelf space up here,

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:08.404
so we have a lot of
stuff in the back.

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:11.362
Actually, I'm looking for

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:15.324
Sex Tips for Straight
Women from a Gay Man.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.749
Oh, yeah. Dr.
Feld has us keep those in stock.

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:24.132
Oh. Okay.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:26.501
Can I give you cash?

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:27.756
Yeah, that works.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.255
Couples come to me
for two reasons.

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.137
To help them save
their marriage, or...

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:34.721
Or what?

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.678
Or to help them end it.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.224
When one person
is this unhappy,

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:45.028
the marriage has to restore
some sort of equilibrium, or...

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:48.653
Or what? Are you trying to
tell me my marriage is over?

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.654
Because I'm not gonna pay you
for one more session

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.610
just because you threaten me,
you smug little prick!

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:58.036
Arnold, your wife
is very unhappy.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.669
And I'm not saying
that she'll ever leave.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.000
I just don't want you to have
anything to regret should she...

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.838
I'm simply
saying the moment is here

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.264
and you have to ask yourself,

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:15.512
"Have I done all I could?"

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.889
Have you, Arnold?

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:21.354
Is this the best
that you can do?

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:52.341
I'm sorry, there's...

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:56.640
Listen, I can...
Maybe a little tip would help, you know.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.018
You want to buy a table?

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:00.185
I need it.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.475
So whatever...

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:03.852
Look, I need this.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:09.938
Look, I'm really sorry about whatever
is going on in your marriage,

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.569
but I don't think the dinner
was going to save it.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.151
I need a table.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:18.533
I need it, and I'm not going to leave
from right here until I get it.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.862
We're going to
need more space here,

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:54.566
so I want you to push it further
against the wall. All right?

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.235
All right.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.598
Hello. Captain Jack's.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:26.272
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr.
Fletcher. What time was that for?

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:29.146
Uh, all right.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:33.480
Well, thanks for calling.
I do hope you come and visit us sometime.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.361
Thank you very much. Bye.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:38.656
All right.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:41.120
That goes away.

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:48.370
Well?

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:51.423
Got a waiting list.
Got to call them.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:55.673
You got a waiting list?
You will give me that table, so help me God!

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.526
Are you ready?

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.194
I'm almost ready.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.859
You really ready?
'Cause I don't want to be late.

01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:57.651
Yes, I'm really ready.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.573
Very pretty.
Thank you.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.156
You look really nice, too.
Yeah, I do.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.737
You handsome devil.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:11.419
Oh, Arnold.
It's gorgeous!

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.804
I just can't get over it!

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.347
You like it?

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:28.473
Mmm.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.931
This is just exactly...

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.107
A little different
than the Econo Lodge?

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.853
Completely different.

01:12:39.647 --> 01:12:42.776
That place reminds me of when we
drove down to see your mother,

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:44.236
before we were married.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.284
And we stayed at
that little place...

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.125
You know, it was the only
place that was open.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:53.665
It was a truck stop.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:57.123
In Albuquerque?

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.504
Oh, I remember that.
It had orange walls.

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:00.801
Uh-huh.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.424
Yeah.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:05.298
That was the first
time you said it.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.519
First time you
said you loved me.

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:10.971
In that little motel.

01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:18.145
You know, before you said it...

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:23.403
Well, I didn't want to
be the one who said it first,

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.361
but I just...
I had to say it!

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.280
So every time we
talked on the phone

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:33.334
I would say it to
the phone after we hung up!

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:34.584
Really'?

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.708
Yes, I really did that.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.253
I figured if I ever said anything
like that, you'd take off running.

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:41.967
What?

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.929
You could have had your pick.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:50.309
I didn't think
you'd ever want me.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:54.305
I never wanted anything more.

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:07.865
What I don't get is how he
remembers to talk like that.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:13.158
"Consider the metaphor
of the nose."

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.126
I know.
It must be so hard for him.

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:17.795
I wonder if he talks
to his wife like that.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:18.962
That would be...

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:21.882
"Mildred, I find it very
interesting that you are naked."

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:29.715
Can I bring you anything else?

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:31.930
Do you...
No, I'm fine.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:33.101
Okay. No, just the check.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.225
Unless you want to.
No, check, please.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.810
Might get chilly
on the way back.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.025
It's been
getting cold at night.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.993
Well, the thing is, I've...

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.743
I don't know how
you'll take this,

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:55.120
but I got us a room.

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:58.457
Here.

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:01.209
You did?
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:05.343
The front desk has toothbrushes.
I asked them.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:11.428
I thought maybe just
for a night, it'd be...

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.767
You might want to...

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:17.893
So,

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:21.567
after this, we can just...

01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.615
Like it?

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.455
Gosh!

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.287
Oh, my gosh.

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:40.619
Oh!

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.251
Look at this.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.555
Look at this!

01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:55.509
Here's some strawberries.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:57.766
You had to get them,

01:15:58.888 --> 01:15:59.980
so here they are.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:02.357
Anyway, you want some?

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:03.977
Huh?
Strawberries.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:08.110
I'm kind of full.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.157
Yeah, me, too.
And they knew that.

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.075
It's a rip off, really.
You spend 15...

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:15.496
That's okay. You know, I think
I would like to have some.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.498
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:19.158
Okay.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.586
Do you want to eat them
at the table? Okay.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.426
Or we could eat them in
front of the fire. Okay.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:30.590
Okay.

01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:33.635
Um... Oh.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:41.100
On.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:44.190
Sweet.

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:55.323
Mmm.

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:56.995
Is it good?

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:58.956
Mmm! It's good.
It's fresh.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.374
Good.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.539
Chocolaty.
Good.

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:03.702
Mmm.

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.750
You want some?
There's champagne, if you want.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:11.543
Yeah. I know...
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.095
No, you go.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:14.680
There's champagne.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.386
You want some?
I think I would like that, Arnold.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:32.611
Ohh!

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.593

No.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:44.765
When Dr. Feld asked you if you
were still attracted to me.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.226
It was when you looked at me.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:56.560
Just now.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.692
You looked in my face.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:02.779
That had nothing to do with it.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.789
That's when you stopped.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:26.807
Setbacks are a natural part of the process.
They never feel good, though.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.855
I know you feel
like you've failed,

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:36.355
but look where you failed.
You fumbled on the one-yard line.

01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:40.062
When you got here, you weren't
even on the playing field.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.735
You were somewhere
in the parking lot.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:46.368
So I think you're ready to follow
up with a therapist at home.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:49.697
I can recommend
somebody really good.

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:56.708
I have patients who never
should have gotten married.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.956
And you are not those people.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:07.969
Even great marriages
have terrible years.

01:22:09.299 --> 01:22:12.929
So bad that you're

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.856
But don't.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:18.317
Hold on.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:23.781
There will come a time when
you'll look back at this moment

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:28.702
as the prelude to
something fuller

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:33.658

you've ever dreamed.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.285

Yo.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.207
Hey, how was that vacation?
Good!

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.125
Yeah. Where was it, Vermont?
Maine.

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.166
Maine. That's right.
You said Kay likes the ocean.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:04.586
So, how was it?
You going to go back?

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:07.254
Um, probably not.
It's a little overpriced.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:10.304
Yeah. I hear you, but, hey, if it
keeps the missus happy another year,

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.347
I'd say it's well
worth the money spent!

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:13.423
Yeah.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:19.854
Jon Ross came in today.

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:20.897
Mmm-hmm.

01:24:20.973 --> 01:24:23.021
You'd think it was the first
time he'd ever heard that

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.525
October 15th was the
deadline for an extension.

01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:30.699
The guy never filed
on time in his life!

01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:34.905
And we have the same
conversation every year.

01:24:35.779 --> 01:24:38.032
Every goddamn year.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:42.169
For 17 years.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:46.164
Can you imagine that?

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.099
Hi, again, everybody.
School of Golf

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:57.926
is back in session
for another week.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:03.562
This week, it is Chapter 24,
"It's All About the Putting Stroke."

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:06.523
♪I'm Kraig Kann.
This is the professor, Martin Hall.

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:08.024
Putting.
We 're rolling it tonight.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.902
Well, yes. We all want
to hit it fewer times...

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:26.922
So you guys
had fun, huh?

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:31.131
Kind of hard to get
back into the old routine.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:32.256
Mmm.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.301
What is it?

01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:37.053
You look like you could cry.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.133
No!

01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:41.186
Do you still need somebody to take
care of that cat when you go away?

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:43.889
Oh, we already got
the girl next door.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.891
But I don't trust her.
She's not bright.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:48.063
Well, I could do it.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.687
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:52.196
Oh, gosh, are you sure?

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:55.071
Because I think I might
have a spare key with me.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:57.577
And maybe I could stay over.

01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:01.415
A night, or two nights.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:06.287
Well, sure. You do that.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:14.753
I saw The Caine Mutiny
is on later.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:16.008
Mmm-hmm.

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.840
You want to watch it?
I don't think so.

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:19.846
I'm just going to go up to bed.

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:22.302
Kay.

01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:24.104
I'm just a little tired.

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:27.941
Is it really all that bad?

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:32.863
It's just expectations.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:35.532
Like one of those makeovers,
you know?

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:39.903
You look different for a minute

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:42.284
and then go back
to yourself, right?

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:46.705
Right?

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:52.382

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.136
What?

I don't know if I can go back.

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:16.986
You sure this is a gallon can?

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:20.153
Yes, sir, it's a lard can.
Just took it from the pantry, sir.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:24.707
I suppose you're wondering
why I called this meeting.

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:27.705
As you all know by now, we had an
excellent dessert for dinner tonight,

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:30.003
ice cream and
frozen strawberries.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:34.174

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.257
Carol!

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:40.933
You got another corgi!

01:34:41.593 --> 01:34:44.517
I know. This is Emma.

01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:47.766
But three's the limit.
I'm done.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.400
How was y'all's trip?

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:52.817
Our trip was...
Our trip was really...

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:56.696
You should come over tonight and
we'll tell you all about it.

01:34:56.774 --> 01:34:58.367
That'd be great.
I'd love to.

01:34:58.443 --> 01:34:59.444
Yeah.

01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:01.739
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:02.822
Okay.

01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:09.333
That's not going to happen.

01:35:20.506 --> 01:35:22.304
Kay. Arnold.

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:26.475
We are all here
today to witness

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.977
the renewals of your
vows of matrimony.

01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:33.065
We are thrilled, and I
especially am very thrilled,

01:35:33.144 --> 01:35:36.364
to be here and to be a part
of this very special day.

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:40.452
Arnold,
after 32 years of marriage,

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:44.785
I can honestly say that I love
you more than I ever did.

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:47.663
The day I met you
changed my life.

01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:50.002
It made my life.

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:55.254
And now I can't imagine
living my life without you.

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:57.752
It wouldn't be any
kind of life at all.

01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:03.183
When I think about spending
the rest of my life with you,

01:36:04.342 --> 01:36:07.391
I only regret it
won't be long enough.

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:10.148
So I want to now

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:14.273
make this next chapter
of our lives together

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:17.356
something that
we'll both cherish.

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:23.286
I vow to watch more golf with
you without complaining.

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:28.283
I vow to watch less golf,

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:31.794
and to buy you good presents
that aren't for the house.

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:34.793
Maybe like jewelry.

01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:35.919
Like jewelry.

01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:38.548
Jewelry. Yes.

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:41.762
I vow not to cut my hair
any shorter than it is,

01:36:41.838 --> 01:36:43.761
'cause I know you like it long.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.966
Longer.

01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:47.723
I vow not to complain so much.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:49.144
If I can help it,

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.972
because sometimes
there's something

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:53.103
that really needs to
be complained about.

01:36:53.182 --> 01:36:55.560
And I vow to go to one
of those sleep studies

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:59.155
like you've been
asking me to go to.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.699
And I vow to take you
somewhere once a year

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:03.697
that's more than 200
miles away from home

01:37:03.776 --> 01:37:06.074
and isn't to see
a family member.

01:37:08.072 --> 01:37:10.575
Now, on this wonderful day,

01:37:11.117 --> 01:37:13.290
I give you the rest of my life

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:17.882
and I thank God every
day that you're in it.

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:21.219
And I vow to
tell you how I feel,

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:24.093
not just when you ask me.

01:37:25.965 --> 01:37:28.309
And I'll tell you
how I feel about this.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:31.559
I love it. I love you.

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:46.745
We will have the ceremonial
breaking of the nose.

01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:00.258
See? That wasn't so hard.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:03.256
Thank you.

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:07.306
Yes, a big boy.

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:09.426
