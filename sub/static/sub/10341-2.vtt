WEBVTT

01:56.074 --> 01:58.659
Buddhist tradition first came
to the land of snow

01:58.827 --> 02:00.744
in the 5th century A.D.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.288
The first Tibetan king to be touched
by the dharma

02:03.456 --> 02:05.582
was King Hathatha Rignamputsan.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.960
He and succeeding kings
were collectively known

02:08.128 --> 02:10.045
as the Happy Generations.

02:10.213 --> 02:14.633
Now, some historians place them
in a Water Snake year, 213 A.D.

02:15.176 --> 02:18.804
Others in the year of a Water Ox,
173 A.D.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.181
Amazing, isn't it?
The Happy Generations.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.684
Agent Cooper, I am thrilled to pieces
that the dharma came

02:23.852 --> 02:25.269
to King Ho-Ho-Ho, I really am,

02:25.436 --> 02:27.688
but I'm trying to focus
on the more immediate problems

02:27.856 --> 02:29.481
of our own century here
in Twin Peaks.

02:30.024 --> 02:33.569
Albert, you'd be surprised
at the connection between the two.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.529
Color me amazed.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.824
Ronette Pulaski
has woken from her coma.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.492
And?

02:41.619 --> 02:43.704
I'm thinking she's gonna have
quite a story to tell,

02:43.872 --> 02:46.498
- when she regains the ability to speak.
- So she's not talking?

02:46.749 --> 02:50.836
Mm. Waking but silent,
probably shock.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.756
I'm gonna show her the sketches
of Leo Johnson and Bob,

02:54.924 --> 02:57.092
the man Sarah Palmer saw
in her vision.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.136
The man who came to me
in my dream.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.930
Has anyone seen Bob on Earth
in the last few weeks?

03:02.140 --> 03:03.932
No, not yet.

03:04.809 --> 03:08.228
Okay. I performed the autopsy
on Jacques Renault.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.230
Stomach contents revealed...

03:10.398 --> 03:12.774
Let's see.
- beer cans, a Maryland license plate,

03:12.942 --> 03:16.820
half a bicycle tire, a goat
and a small wooden puppet,

03:16.988 --> 03:18.614
goes by the name of Pinocchio.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.407
You're making a joke.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.076
I like to think of myself
as one of the Happy Generations.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.371
And by the way,
the fat boy wasn't strangled.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.041
Killer snuffed him with a pillow.
He was wearing gloves.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.834
Tape used to bind his wrists
was stolen

03:31.002 --> 03:32.878
from the hospital supply closet.
That is it.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.256
If Jacques has any secrets,
he'll be taking them underground.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.427
- What about the mill?
- Well, preliminary suggests arson.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.721
I nominate Leo Johnson.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.140
We'll have to get a statement
from Shelly Johnson.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.059
Hospital says she's well enough.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.687
How do you feel?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.566
- Me?
- I believe it's customary to ask

03:54.734 --> 03:57.236
after the health of one
recently plugged three times.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.196
Thanks for asking.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.823
- Don't get sentimental.
- Who shot me, Albert?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.576
My men are interrogating
the hotel guests,

04:04.786 --> 04:06.828
the usual bumper crop
of rural know-nothings

04:06.996 --> 04:09.581
and drunken fly fishermen.
Nothing so far.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.583
The world's most decrepit
room-service waiter

04:11.751 --> 04:14.211
remembers nothing out of the ordinary
about the night.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.963
No surprise there.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.841
SeÃ±or Droolcup has, shall we say,
a mind that wanders.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.639
Albert, my ring is gone.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.353
One day here, the next day gone.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.146
So?

04:34.023 --> 04:37.234
I'm glad you're with us, Albert.
We need the very best.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.612
Dedication to duty wasn't the only thing
that brought me back here, Cooper.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.032
- What else?
- Windom Earle.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.329
Agent Earle?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.290
He's retired.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.210
To a nice comfy chair
complete with wrist restraints

04:55.378 --> 04:57.379
at the local laughing academy.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.089
What happened?

04:59.882 --> 05:01.174
Nobody knows.

05:03.177 --> 05:05.637
Your former partner
flew the coop, Coop.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.141
He escaped. Vanished into thin air.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.601
That's not good.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.241
Hello?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.537
Mrs. Tremond?
It's Meals on Wheels.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.041
Hello?

06:16.209 --> 06:18.126
Enter.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.303
Mrs. Tremond?

06:31.057 --> 06:33.141
Can I put your meal here?

06:33.309 --> 06:35.602
Yes, that's fine.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.744
Miss?

06:53.037 --> 06:54.162
Oh, hi.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.375
Sometimes things
can happen just like this:

07:08.428 --> 07:10.804
Creamed corn.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.686
Do you see creamed corn
on that plate?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.274
Yes.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.486
I requested no creamed corn.

07:29.782 --> 07:33.243
Do you see creamed corn
on that plate?

07:36.873 --> 07:38.540
No.

07:46.507 --> 07:51.261
My grandson is studying magic.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.805
That's nice.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.773
Who are you?

08:05.234 --> 08:08.653
I'm taking over Laura Palmer's place
on the Meals on Wheels.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.284
She's dead.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.788
Did you know her well?

08:24.712 --> 08:26.171
No.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.348
Okay, Mrs. Tremond.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.644
I'll be back tomorrow to pick this up
and to bring your lunch.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.189
They used to bring me
hospital food.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.275
Imagine that.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.656
Young lady?

08:53.574 --> 08:56.243
You might ask Mr. Smith next door.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.372
He was Laura's friend.

09:07.213 --> 09:11.341
Mr. Smith does not leave his house.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.168
Hello?

09:55.344 --> 09:59.723
She seemed like a very nice girl.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.319
Thanks, Harry.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.083
Ronette?

11:21.597 --> 11:24.015
I can't get this thing to work.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.397
Excuse us, Ronette.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.651
"Stop.

11:36.862 --> 11:42.951
Read operating instructions
beneath seat before using.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.459
Stand next to chair or stool.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.421
Do not remain seated.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.340
Place foot on base

11:57.508 --> 12:00.051
and pull seat all the way up

12:00.219 --> 12:02.595
until you hear a click."

12:09.019 --> 12:10.895
Sorry, Ronette.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.492
Ronette,

12:24.785 --> 12:26.703
can you hear me?

12:28.122 --> 12:29.414
Okay.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.041
I'm glad you're feeling better.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.337
I don't want to upset you,
but we need your help.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.425
I'm gonna show you some sketches.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.928
We need to know
if you've seen these men before.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.766
We need to know if these
are the men that hurt you, okay?

12:54.523 --> 12:56.107
Do you recognize this man?

13:02.865 --> 13:04.449
Is this the man that hurt you?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.797
Mm.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.140
Ronette.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.496
Train. Train.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.123
- Ronette?
- Tr... Train, train.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.376
- Nurse. Right away.
- Train?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.294
- Train?
- Tra...

13:58.462 --> 14:02.382
Are you in the train car? Train car?

14:02.550 --> 14:06.135
Train, train, train!

14:06.345 --> 14:08.596
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Train!

14:08.764 --> 14:10.390
Okay, okay. Stay calm.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.725
Train, train.

14:14.645 --> 14:18.022
Brother Ben,
we've got two ledgers

14:18.190 --> 14:21.818
and one smoked cheese pig.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.528
Which one do we burn?

14:23.737 --> 14:26.447
And it ain't gonna be my pig.

14:30.703 --> 14:36.749
The real ledger shows the mill
slowly sinking into bankruptcy,

14:36.917 --> 14:39.586
masterminded by Catherine.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.548
The one she faked,
for public consumption,

14:43.716 --> 14:47.510
shows the mill
turning a healthy profit.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.598
So which one do we burn?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.225
Catherine's dead,

14:54.602 --> 14:57.520
we put all of our money on Josie,

14:57.813 --> 15:01.399
Catherine takes the fall for the fire,

15:01.567 --> 15:04.193
Josie pockets the insurance money,

15:04.361 --> 15:08.865
sells us the mill and the land and...
No, wait a minute.

15:09.158 --> 15:13.828
First she has to get dear Pete
to sign on the dotted line.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.874
Why does Pete have to sign?

15:18.083 --> 15:23.671
Andrew's will calls for Catherine
or her heirs to approve of any sale.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.050
So which one do we burn?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.762
Once Josie sells us the mill,

15:30.930 --> 15:34.557
we could get a better price
if it appears to be more profitable.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.768
So we burn the real one.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.645
On the other hand,

15:38.812 --> 15:43.733
the real one would hold up
under any future scrutiny.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.782
Depending upon how one looks
at the situation, it appears

15:50.950 --> 15:52.575
they both have merit.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.786
I know.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.247
Maybe we should burn both of them.

15:58.457 --> 16:03.962
It looks like we are 100 percent certain
that we're not sure.

16:04.421 --> 16:09.968
Jer, obviously something
requires burning.

16:10.427 --> 16:16.724
And since we don't wanna set fire
to your smoked cheese pig,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.770
why don't we, uh,

16:22.231 --> 16:23.982
try these?

16:25.025 --> 16:27.068
Marshmallows!

16:28.028 --> 16:31.155
Ben, where are those hickory sticks?

17:26.503 --> 17:29.756
Margaret,
it's always very nice to see you.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.719
But if you're gonna spit
your sticky pitch gum out in the diner,

17:34.887 --> 17:36.054
please use an ashtray

17:36.263 --> 17:39.223
and not the counter or the booth
like you did last time?

17:45.522 --> 17:48.441
I'll have a bear claw.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.828
You wear shiny objects
on your chest.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.831
Yes, I do.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.875
Are you proud?

18:06.126 --> 18:09.837
No, achievement is its own reward.
Pride obscures it.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.340
Cream?

18:18.597 --> 18:21.599
My log has something to tell you.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.101
Do you know it?

18:24.478 --> 18:26.687
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.858
I do not introduce the log.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.152
Can you hear it?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.616
No, ma'am, I cannot.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.077
I will translate.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.379
Deliver the message.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.551
Do you understand?

19:00.097 --> 19:02.598
Yes, ma'am.
As a matter of fact, I do.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.668
No messages, Deputy Brennan.

20:17.841 --> 20:20.676
Listen to me, Lucy Moran.
You just listen.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.054
When the Tacoma Sperm Bank
was looking for donors,

20:23.222 --> 20:24.805
naturally, I applied.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.642
It's my civic duty,
and I like whales.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.980
A routine physical examination
revealed that I'm sterile.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.400
Sure, I thought it meant
I didn't have to take a bath,

20:36.568 --> 20:39.070
but the doctors told me the truth.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.198
They told me I can't have babies.

20:43.242 --> 20:49.288
So, what I wanna know now is
why are you having one and how?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.336
Hello, Hank.

21:40.173 --> 21:43.467
I bet Lucy asked you
to wait outside, huh?

21:44.094 --> 21:45.594
Might've.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.183
You know,
that's an awfully cute buck, Harry.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.813
Let's not waste our time.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.690
Okay.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.526
Why don't you

22:02.154 --> 22:04.947
just sign in like a good boy?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.074
Keep your nose clean
for another week.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.389
It's really nice to see you again.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.281
Interesting piece of work.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.701
How long were you
and Hank friends?

22:51.411 --> 22:53.621
We grew up together.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.499
Hank used to be
a Bookhouse Boy.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.585
Back then,

23:00.796 --> 23:02.546
Hank was one of the best of us.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.298
Sheriff Truman,

23:04.466 --> 23:06.217
I have Ben Horne
on the phone for you.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.386
Would you like me
to transfer him to you?

23:08.553 --> 23:11.347
Well, not him but his phone call?

23:13.725 --> 23:15.309
Put him on, Lucy.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.649
Mr. Horne, this is Lucy.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.819
I'm gonna transfer you now
into Sheriff Truman's office.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.780
He's in there with
Special Agent Dale Cooper.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.282
Okay, so hold on.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.668
Sheriff Truman,
I've transferred Ben Horne to you.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.004
It's the line with the light
that's blinking.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.342
- Yes, Ben.
- Harry,

23:49.678 --> 23:50.719
Audrey's missing.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.682
- What?
- For as much as, uh, maybe two days.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.100
You hold on.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.145
Audrey Horne is missing.

24:11.741 --> 24:16.787
One insurance policy, unsigned.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.581
"Un"?

24:19.749 --> 24:22.501
The agent said that Catherine
was concerned

24:22.669 --> 24:24.795
about certain irregularities,

24:24.963 --> 24:29.592
such as Josie being named
the chief beneficiary.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.844
Agent wasn't supposed
to show it to her.

24:32.012 --> 24:36.182
Well, considering
Catherine's smoky fate,

24:36.349 --> 24:39.226
for our side, it's all for the best.

24:40.604 --> 24:45.357
Well. Win a few, lose a few.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.070
Let's get those pickled icemen
on the blower.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.161
Gentlemen,
I've been giving this a lot of thought.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.206
This mill fire will put contract signing
on hold for the moment,

25:00.415 --> 25:03.709
so we must ensure that the moment,
our moment, does not pass us by.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.544
I therefore recommend
we make a quick

25:05.712 --> 25:07.463
but cordial follow-up phone call
to Iceland,

25:07.672 --> 25:08.714
a little gentle handling,

25:08.882 --> 25:11.300
let Einar know
that we're right on top of this thing.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.969
We can handle that.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.597
Ben Horne for Einar Thorson.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.226
Oh. Now, this is a coincidence.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.271
Einar.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.235
What's that?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.988
Where did you hear about it?

25:34.324 --> 25:38.661
Mr. Palmer called
to tell you about the fire?

25:42.123 --> 25:44.667
No, no, I wouldn't call it
a disaster at all.

25:44.834 --> 25:48.504
It's just one of those things,
an unfortunate development.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.880
But I assure you, Einar,

25:50.048 --> 25:53.467
that it in no way
will affect our development plans.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.843
Jerry Horne here, Einar.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.597
Full speed ahead.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.560
Yes, yes, of course, Einar.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.563
We will fax all pertinent details
to you.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.855
Yes, yes, I promise.

26:07.023 --> 26:11.443
Listen, I don't want you to worry
your attractive blond head about this.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.821
Einar, I'm in a meeting. Gotta go.

26:16.157 --> 26:17.741
Leland?

26:18.577 --> 26:22.288
Leland, here's an idea.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.748
Let's take you off
of damage control,

26:24.916 --> 26:27.960
let you concentrate on something
that you can handle.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.588
Like my tax return.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.470
I know him.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.431
Excuse me?

26:42.976 --> 26:47.855
My grandfather's summer house
on Pearl Lakes.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.609
He lived right next door.

26:52.902 --> 26:55.195
I was just a little boy.

26:57.198 --> 26:59.366
But I know him.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.122
I've gotta tell the sheriff
about this right away.

27:07.834 --> 27:09.501
Jerry,

27:10.378 --> 27:12.713
please kill Leland.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.093
Is this real, Ben,

27:18.261 --> 27:23.015
or some strange and twisted dream?

27:25.852 --> 27:29.396
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine...

27:29.606 --> 27:31.899
It's all right, Shelly, come on.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.779
The bullet lodged in his spine,
but we removed it successfully.

27:36.946 --> 27:40.949
As for possible paralysis,
it's too early to tell.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.576
Leo lost a lot of blood,

27:42.786 --> 27:45.537
most of it before we had a chance
to operate.

27:45.705 --> 27:49.625
I fear the resulting oxygen deprivation
starved his brain,

27:50.210 --> 27:52.544
induced the coma you see here.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.422
Is he a vegetable?

27:58.301 --> 27:59.510
Is he in pain?

27:59.719 --> 28:01.512
He's not in pain.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.181
Beyond that, it's hard to say.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.268
Can you make him better?

28:08.603 --> 28:11.313
We can maintain his current state.

28:12.023 --> 28:15.025
Offer nutrition, life-support.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.946
Beyond that,
the only ally we have is time.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.907
I'm sorry, Shelly.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.201
Me too.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.663
Are they gonna put him in prison?

28:28.748 --> 28:32.334
I know he's a suspect
in several felonies.

28:35.338 --> 28:38.132
I guess at the moment
he's kind of in prison anyway.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.509
Yes, he is.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.774
Come on, I'll take you back
to your room.

28:58.069 --> 29:01.405
Norma's waiting downstairs
to drive you home.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.795
Hello, Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.923
Who may I say is calling, please?

29:21.259 --> 29:24.052
I'm sorry, I can't connect you
with Sheriff Truman

29:24.220 --> 29:27.055
unless you tell me
what your name is.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.808
You won't?

29:30.894 --> 29:34.021
I'm sorry, but I can't connect you
with Sheriff Truman

29:34.189 --> 29:36.982
unless you tell me who you are.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.864
I'm terribly sorry,
but I'm going to have to hang up now.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.470
Hey, I'll take it from here.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.388
No. No, you won't.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.474
No, it's okay.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.186
Okay, but watch out for this one.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.896
Okay.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.320
Why is the vacuum cleaner off?

31:05.488 --> 31:07.614
Look at those toes.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.700
What toes?

31:10.535 --> 31:12.160
I brought the ice.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.998
Frosty? My little snowman.

31:16.165 --> 31:18.709
I feel a cold front moving in.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.294
Mm.

31:21.212 --> 31:25.841
Hi, Emory.
You remember me? Huh?

31:26.009 --> 31:29.386
It really looks like you got yourself
in a fix here, huh?

31:29.554 --> 31:30.596
Well, guess what.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.599
I'm gonna tell you a nice
little bedtime story. Are you ready?

31:34.058 --> 31:38.020
Once upon a time there was
a sweet, innocent girl named Red...

31:38.187 --> 31:39.229
That's me.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.357
- and she met a bad old wolf...
That's you.

31:42.525 --> 31:46.737
- and she kicked the crap out of that
wolf and she told her daddy all about it.

31:46.946 --> 31:47.988
Then she told the police,

31:48.156 --> 31:50.991
and the bad old wolf
went to jail for a million years.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.994
- What do you want?
- I wanna know everything you know.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.915
Perfume counter, Laura Palmer,
Ronette Pulaski and One-Eyed Jack's.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.167
You're insane.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.169
Heh. I'm insane?

32:02.337 --> 32:05.172
Well, I'm Audrey Horne
and I get what I want.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.299
- Understand?
- Yes, all right.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.594
I work for the owner
of One-Eyed Jack's.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.804
- Who is?
- I work for the owner

32:12.972 --> 32:15.349
- of One-Eyed Jack's.
- Who is?

32:15.558 --> 32:16.600
Your father.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.645
He owns it all.
Hell, he owns everything.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.772
I run girls
through the perfume counter.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.899
I recruited Ronette and Laura.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.944
- Did Laura come here?
- One weekend.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.363
She was using drugs.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.782
We threw her out.
I never saw her again, I swear.

32:31.991 --> 32:33.784
Did my father know
that Laura was here?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.494
Yes, yes, he did.

32:36.371 --> 32:40.123
Mr. Horne makes it his business
to entertain all the girls.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.293
Did she know he owned this place?

32:43.461 --> 32:44.544
Owned what?

32:44.712 --> 32:48.548
- One-Eyed Jack's!
- Yes! Yes. Probably she did.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.592
Laura always got her way.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.971
Understand?

32:54.180 --> 32:56.181
Just like you.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.323
Why don't you change the station?

33:16.452 --> 33:17.494
That's good.

33:19.455 --> 33:21.039
Yeah.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.711
I made the call.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.838
Told them I was Leo's cousin.

33:28.464 --> 33:29.715
Leo gets his disability

33:29.882 --> 33:33.343
as long as he stays out of prison.
It's a lot of money, Shelly.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.387
Over 5,000 a month.

33:35.555 --> 33:39.099
But you only get it
if he stays at home.

33:40.184 --> 33:43.729
I don't care about the money.
I don't want Leo home.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.773
Leo is in dreamland.

33:46.941 --> 33:50.902
You can stick him in the corner
and hang doughnuts from his ears.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.363
Sheriff Truman wants me
to make a statement.

33:53.573 --> 33:57.367
No way. Look, they can't force you
to testify against your husband.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.911
All you gotta do is get Leo home,

34:00.079 --> 34:02.789
sit and collect the checks.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.336
Leo owes you, baby.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.589
Now we can really make him pay.

34:10.798 --> 34:12.340
You want something nice?
We can buy it.

34:12.508 --> 34:16.178
You want to go someplace special,
sit in the sun?

34:16.345 --> 34:18.305
It's on Leo. Understand?

34:24.353 --> 34:27.731
I guess it would be nice
not to have to worry about money.

34:28.691 --> 34:30.233
I have a lot of bills I have to pay.

34:30.401 --> 34:35.697
Bills? Forget about bills.
I'm talking about a new way of life.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.369
Together?

34:48.836 --> 34:50.754
What do you think?

34:55.927 --> 35:00.680
I think I wanna get comfortable.

35:01.015 --> 35:04.184
That's why I got
my dad's Continental.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.189
Mm.

35:09.357 --> 35:14.361
Bobby Briggs,
I'm gonna eat you up.

35:15.154 --> 35:16.863
Promise?

35:18.407 --> 35:20.575
Just watch me.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.794
Diane, I received
some very bad news today.

35:31.212 --> 35:34.464
Windom Earle has vanished.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.342
The disappearance
of my former partner

35:37.510 --> 35:40.220
is extremely troubling.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.766
I also learned that Audrey Horne
is missing.

35:45.434 --> 35:50.438
Audrey's absence touches me
in ways I could not predict.

35:50.606 --> 35:54.025
I find myself thinking not of clues
or of evidence

35:54.193 --> 35:56.903
but of the content of her smile.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.701
Who is it?

36:02.910 --> 36:05.829
It's Major Briggs, Agent Cooper.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.256
Just a moment.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.847
- Major.
- May I come in?

36:24.015 --> 36:25.473
Please.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.734
I have a message for you.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.611
From whom?

36:38.029 --> 36:42.324
I'm not at liberty
to reveal the nature of my work.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.452
This secrecy pains me
from time to time.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.496
Any bureaucracy
that functions in secret

36:48.664 --> 36:52.042
inevitably lends itself to corruption.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.503
But these rules I have pledged
to uphold.

36:55.671 --> 36:57.172
I believe a pledge is sacred.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.132
Speaking as a man

36:59.300 --> 37:02.010
and a fellow employee
of the federal government, so do I.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.930
Well, I may reveal this much:

37:05.097 --> 37:06.973
Among my many tasks

37:07.141 --> 37:10.268
is the maintenance
of deep-space monitors

37:10.436 --> 37:13.104
aimed at galaxies beyond our own.

37:14.190 --> 37:18.693
We routinely receive
various communications,

37:18.861 --> 37:22.239
space garbage,
to decode and examine.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.741
They look something like this.

37:27.662 --> 37:31.623
It's radio waves and gibberish,
Agent Cooper.

37:32.833 --> 37:35.293
Till Thursday night.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.504
Friday morning, to be exact.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.715
Around the time that I was shot.

37:42.718 --> 37:46.221
The readout took us by surprise.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.890
Row after row of gibberish.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.142
And all of a sudden...

37:51.936 --> 37:55.647
"The owls are not what they seem."

38:04.323 --> 38:05.615
Why did you bring this to me?

38:06.450 --> 38:09.786
Because later in the morning...

38:11.455 --> 38:12.580
"Cooper,

38:15.376 --> 38:18.837
Cooper. Cooper."

38:21.048 --> 38:22.757
My God.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.890
That was really good.
Let's try it again.

38:47.825 --> 38:55.832
Just you and I

38:56.083 --> 39:03.923
Just you and I

39:05.384 --> 39:08.303
Together

39:09.305 --> 39:13.058
Forever

39:13.392 --> 39:16.519
In love

39:21.108 --> 39:23.109
Just you

39:23.319 --> 39:25.153
Just you

39:25.321 --> 39:29.074
And I
And I

39:29.283 --> 39:33.328
- Just you
Just you

39:33.496 --> 39:35.663
And I

39:35.873 --> 39:38.249
And I

39:38.459 --> 39:42.379
Together

39:42.546 --> 39:46.424
Forever

39:46.634 --> 39:55.934
In love

39:56.143 --> 40:00.522
In love

40:01.190 --> 40:05.693
We go strolling together

40:11.075 --> 40:14.702
In love

40:17.123 --> 40:23.670
We go strolling forever

40:24.088 --> 40:26.423
Oh

40:27.716 --> 40:32.011
- Just you
Just you

40:32.179 --> 40:36.307
And I
And I

40:36.517 --> 40:42.897
Just you and I

40:43.065 --> 40:44.691
And I

40:44.900 --> 40:49.028
Together

40:49.196 --> 40:51.656
Forever

40:53.701 --> 40:57.745
In love

41:03.210 --> 41:06.921
Just you

41:07.590 --> 41:10.049
And I

41:11.635 --> 41:14.179
Just you

41:15.639 --> 41:19.267
And I

41:20.144 --> 41:23.771
Just you

41:23.939 --> 41:26.941
And I

41:28.486 --> 41:30.820
Just you

41:32.448 --> 41:35.200
And I

41:36.535 --> 41:38.620
Just you

41:41.916 --> 41:43.791
Donna.

41:45.294 --> 41:46.503
Donna, what's wrong?

41:46.670 --> 41:48.379
Nothing.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.051
Donna?

41:53.344 --> 41:54.385
Donna, what's going on?

41:54.553 --> 41:56.721
I'm trembling, James.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.806
You made me.

42:00.226 --> 42:01.809
Donna.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.898
Donna?

42:08.234 --> 42:09.442
Yes?

42:09.610 --> 42:13.988
There's a telephone call for you
from a Harold Smith.

42:15.199 --> 42:18.326
Oh, okay. I'll get it in the hallway.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.381
Okay, Dad. I got it.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.800
Okay, sweetheart.

42:35.844 --> 42:37.387
Hello?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.765
Mr. Smith?

42:43.686 --> 42:45.937
I received yours.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.692
I wanted to talk to you.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.153
We can meet?

42:55.406 --> 42:56.781
Okay.

44:22.159 --> 44:26.371
The owls are not what they seem.

44:32.836 --> 44:36.547
The owls are not what they seem.

44:47.768 --> 44:49.977
Laura!

44:52.064 --> 44:54.190
Laura!

45:14.336 --> 45:15.461
Agent Cooper.

45:15.671 --> 45:17.839
- It's me, Audrey.
- Audrey?

45:18.632 --> 45:19.841
Where are you?

45:20.050 --> 45:21.467
Why aren't you here?

45:21.677 --> 45:24.429
Audrey, this is no time
for schoolgirl games.

45:24.596 --> 45:26.097
I want you home now.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.892
I saw you in your tuxedo.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.395
You look like a movie star.

45:32.563 --> 45:35.314
Audrey,
if you're in any kind of trouble...

45:35.482 --> 45:39.152
I am in trouble,
but I'm gonna come home now.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.448
Audrey? Audrey?

45:44.950 --> 45:46.534
Trouble, Miss Horne?

45:47.202 --> 45:49.120
You don't know what trouble is.

45:50.164 --> 46:54.852
Not by a long shot.
