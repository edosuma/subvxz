Who cares about inclusions when

It's a lot of steel
to be working with.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.145
- I'm just gonna use that whole
piece of the mild steel, fold

08:40.145 --> 08:42.605
<i>the mild steel over</i>
<i>like a taco shell, and just</i>

08:42.605 --> 08:44.899
hook my bit in and try
to get everything welded up.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.401
- Yeah, he really could have
done that with about

08:46.401 --> 08:48.486
half that material.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.281
There's only hardenable steel
in the top inch of that,

08:51.281 --> 08:53.366
so as he drives that down,

08:53.366 --> 08:56.619
who knows where that hardened
steel's gonna wind up?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.538
- Alan's over here
folding over his steel

08:58.538 --> 09:00.957
using a similar technique.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.126
<i>- It's hard to stand out</i>
<i>when you're among smiths</i>

09:03.126 --> 09:05.420

experience than myself,

09:05.420 --> 09:08.131
<i>but it's really going my way.</i>
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

09:08.131 --> 09:10.759
- Alan looks like he has
set himself up beautifully.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.303
That taco, he got it
in a very nice U shape,

09:13.303 --> 09:15.221
drove that hardened steel
down in the center.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
He's just setting
those welds up.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.434
Now, that should draw
out just beautifully.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.352
- With a ceramics background
and being able to see

09:21.352 --> 09:23.313

09:23.313 --> 09:25.273
<i>that transitions well</i>
<i>into the bladesmithing,</i>

09:25.273 --> 09:29.402
and I believe that
that'll give me an edge.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.571
- I don't know about you.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.573
Three hours seemed a whole hell
of a lot longer back home.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.325
<i>We hit that hour mark,</i>

09:35.325 --> 09:38.203
and I'm feeling like
where did I slow down?

09:38.203 --> 09:40.872
<i>My billet is thicker than</i>
<i>I thought it was gonna be,</i>

09:40.872 --> 09:43.124
and so it's just taking
its own sweet time

09:43.124 --> 09:44.834
<i>getting to that temperature</i>
<i>where I can start moving it.</i>

09:44.834 --> 09:46.878
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.713
<i>That clock on the wall,</i>

09:48.713 --> 09:52.008
it's like having a ton
sitting on your head.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.345
<i>I'm behind the eight ball</i>
<i>on this one.</i>

09:55.345 --> 10:00.058
- Right now the San Mai is not
cooperating with me one iota.

10:00.058 --> 10:03.353
- I think the end of
Ed's billet is opened up.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.396
- Hopefully it's just the end
of that weld.

10:05.396 --> 10:09.526
- It just doesn't want to stay.
That son of a bitch.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.111
- I'm getting a little bit
worried about Ed.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.029
- [bleep].

10:13.029 --> 10:16.032
- He looks physically
exhausted right now.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.034
- My back was all right
the first hour,

10:18.034 --> 10:20.370
and then it just went downhill.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.871
- Look at him. He's tripoding

10:21.871 --> 10:23.414
on the water barrel
in the back.

10:23.414 --> 10:28.169
- It feels much
like being burnt.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.088
<i>I'm hurting.</i>
- You doing all right?

10:30.088 --> 10:32.382
How's your back, man?
- Man, I'm on fire.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.717
My brain right now
is telling me to quit,

10:34.717 --> 10:36.845
<i>but my father, he never quit.</i>

10:36.845 --> 10:39.764
I'm not gonna let my back take
me out of here at any cost.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.766
<i>I just have to keep going.</i>

10:41.766 --> 10:43.935
- The great thing about this is
that people find a way

10:43.935 --> 10:46.271
that nothing of your own
physical limitations

10:46.271 --> 10:48.314
will stop you from
doing your passion.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.484
- But I'm still scared to
death, because I'm way behind.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.654
- Bladesmiths, two hours
has elapsed!

10:54.654 --> 10:59.367
You have just 60 minutes
remaining to finish your work!

10:59.367 --> 11:01.077
Alan's billet looks great.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.037
- It looks like one color.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.039
- The only thing that Alan has
to worry about at this point

11:05.039 --> 11:06.916
is remembering
where your hardened steel is.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.002
- While everything is going
perfectly, you know,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.296
<i>I need to be taking advantage</i>
<i>of this equipment.</i>

11:11.296 --> 11:13.214
I'm ready to attack
the power hammer.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.300
- And I hope Alan doesn't go
too narrow on that tang.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.885
- [bleep].

11:16.885 --> 11:20.388
- Oh, Big Blue
just ate his tang.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.932
- It almost got away from me.
It was kind of scary.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.602
<i>Unfortunately, the handle</i>
<i>is a little bit curved,</i>

11:25.602 --> 11:27.437
<i>and not in the direction</i>
<i>that I would like.</i>

11:27.437 --> 11:29.147
<i>I could just clip it</i>
<i>off and correct it,</i>

11:29.147 --> 11:31.149
<i>but I don't want</i>
<i>to lose a minute.</i>

11:31.149 --> 11:33.902
[bleep] damn, three hours
just isn't very long.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.154
- So you can actually see
on Hunter's piece of material

11:36.154 --> 11:38.156
how the edges are cooling
at different temperatures.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.742
- Yup.
- That indicates not welded.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.453
- Now, is that due to the
steels not sticking together,

11:43.453 --> 11:46.456
or is that just different
widths as he's forging it out?

11:46.456 --> 11:48.750
- As they're not stuck together
, the piece that peels out

11:48.750 --> 11:51.628
and is more exposed to
the air is cooling faster.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.922
- Oh, man, just can't
get it to weld right.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.840
- And it goes back to
preparation again.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.300
Did he clean the metal?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.052
- Well, we see it
again and again.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.179
The cleaner you can
make that material,

12:01.179 --> 12:03.765
the better those welds
are gonna be on the first try.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.310
The best steel we've seen
is always off the clean stuff.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.896
- Is it not sticking?
- Not in a couple spots.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.190
- You get another fire brick
to close up the other end?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.316
- Hopefully I can get it to go.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.109
- Well, don't give up, man.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.527
<i>- I'm really running</i>
<i>out of time,</i>

12:16.527 --> 12:18.154
but there's no point
going forward

12:18.154 --> 12:21.532
if I don't have
those welds closed up.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.535
- Tim's working that seax tip
into his blade now.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.995
<i>- I got the bevels</i>
<i>rough forged,</i>

12:25.995 --> 12:27.789

12:27.789 --> 12:29.666
I wish it was a little
bit wider on the tip.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.334

<i>at least a half hour</i>

12:31.334 --> 12:32.627

<i>that I wanted to.</i>

12:32.627 --> 12:34.545
I don't have that time anymore.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.589

to quench.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.267
I'm really surprised by that.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.270

- My one worry is that

17:23.918 --> 17:26.003
I don't know

17:26.003 --> 17:27.129
that the hardened edge
is in the middle all the time,

17:27.129 --> 17:28.756
so there are sections back here

17:28.756 --> 17:31.050
that don't have hardened
steel at the edge.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.802
- When he was welding that,

17:32.802 --> 17:35.513
we actually saw that
his two pieces of mild steel,

17:35.513 --> 17:36.806
they were kind of offset,

17:36.806 --> 17:38.474
so it could have easily

17:38.474 --> 17:40.434
have lipped over the top
of the hardened steel.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.270
- Yeah.
- If he grinds that all away,

17:42.270 --> 17:44.438
it could just be
a steel core underneath.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.691

to get back to the steel.
