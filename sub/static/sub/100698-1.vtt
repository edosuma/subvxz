14:31.080 --> 14:32.080
[beeps]

14:56.170 --> 14:58.000
[indistinct chatter]

15:08.420 --> 15:11.170
Oh, uh, Ben,
uh, come in.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.540
Obviously you know
Commander Kyle.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.250
Hello, Ben.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.120
What's going on?

15:16.120 --> 15:18.170
Commander's been filling us in
on your mom's progress.

15:18.170 --> 15:20.670
I wanted you
to be a part of this.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.880
And I know that
your mother's medical care
means a great deal to you.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.170
They're suggesting
we continue the treatments,
at an increased dosage.

15:27.170 --> 15:30.420
Given the results we're seeing,
it's a decision that
we're comfortable with.

15:30.420 --> 15:33.000
You have enough stem cells?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.420
Well, we've depleted
the initial batch.

15:35.420 --> 15:39.040
But we've managed
to secure a new source.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.000
[Elaine]
It's amazing.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.790
Well, if your progress
continues, and I expect it will,

15:44.790 --> 15:49.040
it would be a groundbreaking
advance for medical science.

15:49.040 --> 15:55.120
Obviously, I want this
for myself, but the thought
of helping others...

15:55.120 --> 15:56.620
Yeah.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.380
Well, let us know
when you need us.

15:58.380 --> 16:03.540
Well, I certainly
appreciate your cooperation.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.120
[door opens and closes]

16:13.120 --> 16:18.290
I know you're worried about me
getting my hopes up.

16:18.290 --> 16:19.920
But we've always said,
one day at a time.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.500
And today is a good day.
Positivity.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.420
In fact, we're all
going to lunch.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.880
I'm going to have Roberta
get us a table at The Reef.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.960
The Reef?
Sounds good.

16:36.500 --> 16:40.040
Listen, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.080
What?

16:44.080 --> 16:46.040
That Klesco video,

16:46.040 --> 16:49.330
girl in the water
at that depth she couldn't be.

16:49.330 --> 16:53.120
It's been getting in my head.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.920
Okay, all set.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.040
And Doug
is going to meet us there.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.920
[bell jingles]

17:03.920 --> 17:07.920
I owe Beth a call, see if she's
patched things up with Bryan.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.170
I'll be back.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.620
You still angry with Ben?

17:25.580 --> 17:28.790
I'm just struggling
with what he did.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.120
He did it to help.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.790
I know.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.120
It just...

17:35.120 --> 17:36.500
It feels...

17:36.500 --> 17:38.210
It feels different now.

17:41.790 --> 17:46.830
I still love Ben,
and I love you.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.080
I'm just struggling.

17:54.330 --> 17:57.830
Human relationships
are complicated.

17:57.830 --> 18:00.710
Yes. Very.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.710
[bell jingles]

18:11.580 --> 18:14.080
[door closes]

18:14.080 --> 18:15.880
Ryn, what's going on?

18:15.880 --> 18:17.170
She is one.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.290
From another tribe.

18:20.290 --> 18:22.210
Not mine.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.710
I've come a very long way
to see you.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.000
I know you were
being held by the humans.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.920
In the facility.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.080
I went there
to try to find you.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.080
You were their experiment;
their test subject.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.080
Beth hasn't heard from Bryan
or the others, they've--

18:55.250 --> 18:56.670
Who's this?

18:56.670 --> 18:58.580
[Maddie]
She's from another tribe.

18:58.580 --> 19:00.080
Friend or foe?

19:00.080 --> 19:01.830
Not clear.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.290
You have our blood.

19:03.290 --> 19:08.000
I do. One-eighth to be exact.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.250
How did you know about me?

19:10.750 --> 19:15.330
Because I was a captive, too.

19:15.330 --> 19:19.330
I've been held by
the Russian government
for the past ten years.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.000
[sighs]

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
[grunting]

19:46.000 --> 19:48.080
[door opens]

19:48.080 --> 19:52.250
[continues grunting]

19:52.250 --> 19:53.540
What are you doing down there?

19:53.540 --> 19:56.500
[grunts] What you need?

19:56.500 --> 19:57.710
You working The Anchor tonight?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.080
Yeah.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.000
Yeah, I've been covering
a lot of shifts ever since

20:03.000 --> 20:05.960
Janine went all in on the whole
Mermaid Adventure Tour business.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.960
Dude, you have no idea
how good it's going.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.710
We're already bringing money in.
It's amazing being the boss.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.120
I thought Janine was the boss.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.250
Yeah, technically, you know.

20:14.250 --> 20:17.170
But I'm whatever is right
underneath the boss, you know?

20:17.170 --> 20:18.880
That'd be an employee.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.460
Yeah.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.170
Listen, I need your help, okay?

20:22.170 --> 20:24.380
I need everyone we know in town
to be at the bar tonight.

20:24.380 --> 20:25.670
Got something big to announce.

20:25.670 --> 20:27.750
Make some calls, okay?

20:27.750 --> 20:30.000
I'll see what I can do, but--

20:30.000 --> 20:33.960
Are you gonna give me
any information?
Nothing? Nothing?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.920
What's your name?

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
They called me Vodnyy Zver.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
It means sea monster.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.120
Now that you're free,
you could choose
any name you like.

20:48.250 --> 20:51.500
There was a powerful
and vengeful sea goddess,

20:51.500 --> 20:55.750
Tiamat, a creator of the oceans.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.750
I read stories of her.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.540
I will call myself Tia.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.040
Lovely.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.380
So you can read?

21:04.380 --> 21:07.330
They taught me well.

21:07.330 --> 21:09.330
Seven languages.

21:09.330 --> 21:13.830
Science, engineering,
technology, human history.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.420
I learned it all.

21:15.420 --> 21:18.960
They also taught me to fight.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.580
They wanted to turn me
into a warrior.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.750
You were already a warrior.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.830
As are you.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.670
How'd they catch you
in the first place?

21:29.670 --> 21:33.880
I was injured in the ocean.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.120
Ga'anda.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.170
[gasps]

21:37.170 --> 21:39.330
What is it?

21:39.330 --> 21:45.210
A predator-- serpent's body,
with tentacles, sharp teeth.

21:45.210 --> 21:47.460
Like a giant squid?

21:47.460 --> 21:50.420
The Ga'anda
is not in your books.

21:50.420 --> 21:53.120
It has taken many of us.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.540
[sighs]

21:55.540 --> 22:00.460
I tried to fight it,
and paid the price.

22:00.460 --> 22:03.460
They left you after that.

22:03.460 --> 22:07.460
In my colony, if you fight,
you must win.

22:07.460 --> 22:11.460
I accepted my fate.

22:11.460 --> 22:15.460
I wandered the ocean alone,
trying to survive.

22:15.460 --> 22:20.250
Then the research boat
caught me, and it all changed.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.040
They tortured me.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.420
Tried to bend me to their will.

22:25.420 --> 22:29.620
I overheard reports
that the U.S. Military
was holding another.

22:29.620 --> 22:33.290
I wanted to know
if it was one of mine.

22:33.290 --> 22:35.920
I escaped and came here.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.080
I am not from your tribe.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.620
I see that.

22:42.620 --> 22:45.620
We have to let go
of the old ways.

22:45.620 --> 22:50.120
If our species
is going to survive,
we must be unified.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.920
I'd like to be alone with Ryn.
A walk.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.830
-Ryn, are you--
-Okay. Yes.

22:59.830 --> 23:03.380
You and the human
are very close.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.620
I saw you hugging her.

23:04.620 --> 23:07.620
Maddie. Yes.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.710
You've been
building their trust.

23:09.710 --> 23:12.460
Is that why you came to land?

23:12.460 --> 23:14.460
For humans?

23:14.460 --> 23:18.290
I was hunting too close
to the surface.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.330
My sister came after me.

23:25.330 --> 23:28.380
She was caught in a net.

23:29.830 --> 23:31.830
[screams]

23:33.920 --> 23:35.380
[screams]

23:35.380 --> 23:38.120
So I came onto land to find her.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.290
Where was she?

23:39.290 --> 23:41.380
She was in a lab.

23:41.380 --> 23:44.000
Then killed.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.540
By humans?

23:55.960 --> 23:57.330
This is your car?

23:59.210 --> 24:01.620
Humans need to possess things.
We don't.

24:01.620 --> 24:02.710
[engine starts]

24:02.710 --> 24:04.500
Get in.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.500
[tires screech]

24:20.580 --> 24:22.500
You are a good driver.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.670
They taught me many things.

24:25.670 --> 24:30.670
I wasn't being held
by the humans,
I chose to stay.

24:30.670 --> 24:34.040
I wanted to learn,
become stronger.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.460
Isn't that why you
agreed to the testing?

24:39.460 --> 24:41.580
I did it to help Ben.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.120
Ben?

24:43.120 --> 24:46.670
He was in trouble,
locked in a cage.

24:46.670 --> 24:49.500
So I did this to get him out.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.290
You're close to him, too.

24:52.290 --> 24:56.580
Ben is good,
a friend of our kind.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.580
He let a man die
to protect our secret.

25:09.880 --> 25:13.120
[beeping]

25:13.120 --> 25:15.080
Something wrong?

25:15.080 --> 25:18.330
Your clearance
has been revoked.

25:18.330 --> 25:21.040
Look, I need
to speak to Commander Kyle.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.040
It's important.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.670
Like I said,
your clearance--

25:23.670 --> 25:25.290
It's about the test subject.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.460
I had a feeling
you might come to see me.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.960
That why you locked me out?

25:35.960 --> 25:39.750
You stole those embryos, Ben.
You're a security risk.

25:39.750 --> 25:44.290
How'd that work out for you?
Is Ryn pregnant?

25:44.290 --> 25:47.250
You should've worked with us.
Big mistake.

25:49.170 --> 25:51.210
Look, maybe we still can.

25:51.210 --> 25:54.750
I mean, we both seem to agree
about my mom's treatment.

25:54.750 --> 25:59.710
Mm. You want to know where
we got the new stem cells.

25:59.710 --> 26:03.170
That is why you're here, right?

26:03.170 --> 26:06.000
Well, we extracted them
from Ryn's sister.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.170
-After you dug up her grave?
-I had no choice.

26:10.170 --> 26:14.000
Ryn's not been volunteering
any of her own cells
after the last procedure.

26:14.000 --> 26:18.040
Can't say I blame her. I mean,
she reacted pretty badly to it
the first time.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.040
Well, we needed another source.

26:20.040 --> 26:24.460
And we had one
lying right here in our lab.

26:24.460 --> 26:30.580
Stem cells in marrow
are only viable
two weeks after death.

26:30.580 --> 26:32.330
In a human body, mm-hmm.

26:32.330 --> 26:34.540
Look, Ben, while Ryn's sister
has been helpful,

26:34.540 --> 26:38.000
what I really want
is a live specimen.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.750
Well, you know
I can't promise that.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.000
Hmm.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.620
Ryn does what she wants.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.250
[ship horn blows]

26:51.250 --> 26:53.250
[engine shuts off]

26:53.250 --> 26:58.170
You say humans possess things,
but so do we.

26:58.170 --> 27:00.330
We have territories
in the water.

27:00.330 --> 27:05.080
Not anymore.
No more borders, Ryn.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.290
[Symphony No. 9 by Beethoven
plays on the stereo]

27:09.290 --> 27:13.210
Beautiful, isn't it?

27:13.210 --> 27:15.250
[volume increases]

27:15.250 --> 27:20.460
The greatest human achievement,
and it's been almost 200 years.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.790
What have they done since?

27:22.790 --> 27:25.040
It's only been destruction.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.420
I need to get to my shift.
If Ryn needs anything--

27:30.420 --> 27:32.920
I'll call you.

27:32.920 --> 27:37.210
[door opens and closes]

27:42.080 --> 27:45.620
[Helen] I'm not really sure
how to do this.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.120
You visited me last night.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.670
[sighs]

27:52.670 --> 27:56.500
In your favorite spot
by my window.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.500
I'd love to see you again.

28:01.170 --> 28:02.420
Please.

28:06.380 --> 28:09.170
Can you give me a sign?

28:09.170 --> 28:12.000
Anything.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So I know that you're here.

28:15.710 --> 28:17.500
[phone buzzes]

28:22.790 --> 28:24.040
Hello?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.380
Hey, it's Ben. Is Ryn there?

28:25.380 --> 28:27.210
[sighs]

28:29.170 --> 28:31.960
They're ruining the oceans.

28:33.710 --> 28:38.710
We create balance,
only take what we need.

28:38.710 --> 28:43.670
We don't kill for sport.
We don't pollute.

28:43.670 --> 28:47.460
We are the most evolved species
on the planet.

28:47.460 --> 28:52.210
We're more intelligent,
more adaptive, stronger.

28:52.210 --> 28:56.120
We were put here
to protect the earth.

28:56.120 --> 28:59.380
That responsibility
cannot be left
in the hands of humans.

28:59.380 --> 29:01.420
What will you do?

29:03.000 --> 29:09.500
First, I must
go back to my tribe,
be their leader again.

29:09.500 --> 29:15.670
Then I can work with
your colony-- and all colonies,
to ensure we are healthy.

29:17.830 --> 29:20.620
Not so many of us now.

29:20.620 --> 29:26.040
Less food. No babies.

29:26.040 --> 29:29.040
We can share our resources,

29:29.040 --> 29:32.880
focus our efforts
on cleansing the oceans,

29:32.880 --> 29:38.670
re-building our food supply,
not fighting each other.

29:38.670 --> 29:42.250
We can restore balance
on Earth.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.460
You going to The Anchor tonight?

29:46.460 --> 29:49.000
Some Calvin-Janine
related activity.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.500
Yeah, I got a super vague text
from Xander about it.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.790
Are you gonna go?

29:52.790 --> 29:55.790
Uh, no, I got
my book club tonight.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.580
What're you reading, Jer?

29:57.580 --> 29:59.080
Eat, Pray, Love.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.210
( typing )

30:20.790 --> 30:24.000
You said you heard about Ryn
from an intelligence report?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.380
Yes.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.920
Did they tell you
the source of the leak?

30:26.920 --> 30:28.290
Why does that matter?

30:28.290 --> 30:30.040
It came from
inside the facility.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.210
Some woman, I think.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
What if it was Nicole?

30:37.000 --> 30:39.040
And that's why
she disappeared.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.580
[phone buzzes]

30:46.670 --> 30:48.620
Look, we need to be careful.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.170
Kyle doesn't
trust us anymore,

30:50.170 --> 30:52.170
and he's getting
more aggressive.

30:52.170 --> 30:53.880
If he comes after you,

30:53.880 --> 30:56.580
I don't want you getting
involved on any level.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.920
No more contact.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.710
But he's helping
your mother.

31:00.710 --> 31:02.540
He took your sister's cells
for that.

31:04.120 --> 31:08.380
Look, he's doing what he wants.
It's too dangerous.

31:08.380 --> 31:13.580
Your sister should be buried
in the ocean, not picked apart
in some lab.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.500
You should do
something about it.

31:19.500 --> 31:23.500
I fought the Ga'anda,
I lost everything.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.750
There were consequences.
This human needs consequences.

31:27.750 --> 31:33.460
No. Look, now is not the time
to take on the military.

31:33.460 --> 31:36.120
We need to be smart about this.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.250
Amen to that.

31:49.790 --> 31:51.080
[phone chimes]

31:55.460 --> 31:56.460
[chimes]

31:58.170 --> 31:59.170
[chimes]

32:07.420 --> 32:09.420
[indistinct chatter]

32:16.120 --> 32:18.380
Hey, hey.
You called everyone?

32:18.380 --> 32:20.120
Yeah, yeah.
Even my mom's here.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.880
You gonna tell us
what this is about?

32:21.880 --> 32:23.420
Soon, my friend.

32:49.420 --> 32:50.420
Ben?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
[indistinct chatter]

33:03.290 --> 33:04.290
Hey.

33:06.210 --> 33:09.170
Uh, I wasn't sure
if you'd be here.

33:09.170 --> 33:11.750
I would've--
I would've called,

33:11.750 --> 33:13.210
but I think I left
my phone at Helen's.

33:13.210 --> 33:16.960
I know your side of it,
why you did it.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.750
I've been trying to wrap
my head around it.

33:25.250 --> 33:29.920
You were under the water,
it was a split-second decision.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.710
Maybe you weren't
thinking clearly.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.790
Still, I-I can't get there.

33:41.460 --> 33:42.710
Okay.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.710
So what does this mean?

33:48.500 --> 33:50.040
I don't know.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.080
[sighs]

34:09.500 --> 34:10.500
[exhales]

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Damn it, Calvin,
was it you?!

34:16.000 --> 34:17.960
-Was what me?
-The cash box is empty.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.120
-All the money from our tours.
-I can explain that, babe.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.710
You are literally
the worst person
to be in business with.

34:24.710 --> 34:26.620
The worst? Janine!

34:26.620 --> 34:29.170
-[music playing loudly]
-Xander, turn off that music!

34:29.170 --> 34:32.830
-[indistinct chatter]
-Everyone, shut up!

34:32.830 --> 34:34.290
What, Calvin?

34:34.290 --> 34:36.080
It was me. I took it.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.580
But it was
for a good cause.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.210
This is why I wanted
everyone here tonight.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.580
[indistinct chatter]

34:45.580 --> 34:47.000
[exhales]

34:47.000 --> 34:48.790
I love you, Janine.

34:48.790 --> 34:53.170
I love how smart you are,
how you always take care of me,

34:53.170 --> 34:55.120
how you're
the most loyal person I know.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.080
This isn't helping.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.080
Just please, stick with me.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.080
[sighs]

35:00.080 --> 35:01.830
I love how you cry

35:01.830 --> 35:04.670
at those pet food commercials
with the lost dog,

35:04.670 --> 35:07.170
I love your mac and cheese,

35:07.170 --> 35:09.210
I love your smell,

35:09.210 --> 35:11.080
I love how you scrunch your nose
when you're angry at me,

35:11.080 --> 35:14.210
I love the curve
on your lower back,

35:14.210 --> 35:16.000
and I love how you--

35:19.920 --> 35:22.120
-[laughter]
-We'll keep that one private.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.170
Look, I thought about it
real hard, okay?

35:25.170 --> 35:28.920
And there is nothing
I don't love about you.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.380
I want to spend
forever with you.

35:33.380 --> 35:35.210
I want to grow old with you.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.670
[sighs]

35:41.380 --> 35:48.210
I know I'm not perfect,
but I'll never stop loving you.

35:48.210 --> 35:52.880
My Neeny, my queen...

35:56.620 --> 35:59.620
[crowd] Ooh!

36:03.500 --> 36:05.580
Will you marry me?

36:08.250 --> 36:09.670
Oh, hell yeah!

36:09.670 --> 36:14.120
[all cheer]

36:23.210 --> 36:25.120
Oh, yeah!

36:25.120 --> 36:27.170
[applause]

36:31.790 --> 36:33.960
What is marry me?

36:35.500 --> 36:38.210
When two people love each other,
and they--

36:38.210 --> 36:43.000
they want to be together
forever, they get married.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.120
With a ring?

36:44.120 --> 36:47.880
The ring is like a symbol
of the marriage.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.330
Did Ben ever give you a ring?

37:03.960 --> 37:08.210
[water splashing]

37:13.830 --> 37:18.120
[water splashing]

37:26.040 --> 37:31.210
-[growling]
-[screaming]

37:47.750 --> 37:49.750
Dad?

37:49.750 --> 37:52.580
Everything okay?

37:52.580 --> 37:54.000
Should probably say yeah.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.250
[chuckles]

37:56.250 --> 37:57.330
[sighs]

37:57.330 --> 37:59.080
It's been a strange time.

38:02.420 --> 38:06.120
Been thinking a lot lately about
the night of the accident.

38:06.120 --> 38:11.420
Well, that makes sense.
I mean, Mom's doing better.

38:11.420 --> 38:13.920
I'm sure it's bringing up
a lot of stuff.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.290
It's not just that.

38:18.420 --> 38:23.040
The girl in that video,
at a depth she couldn't be.

38:25.880 --> 38:30.880
When I dove in
to save your mother,
that was the same thing--

38:30.880 --> 38:34.420
a girl in the water,
in a place she
couldn't possibly be.

38:36.210 --> 38:39.710
[laughs]

38:39.710 --> 38:41.710
[sighs]

38:45.670 --> 38:52.040
Got the Coast Guard report
from that night, hoping
there was something in here.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.210
So many damn questions.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.170
So many damn questions.

39:11.710 --> 39:13.120
[gasps]

39:13.120 --> 39:15.080
Are you okay?

39:15.080 --> 39:19.000
I don't know.
I never feel this before.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.330
-[screaming]
-Breathe.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.750
[groaning]

39:34.000 --> 39:36.540
We have a problem.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.170
The baby is growing
much faster than expected.

39:39.170 --> 39:41.210
It's depleting her.

39:41.210 --> 39:44.920
It's like she's already
six months pregnant.

39:44.920 --> 39:48.380
A mermaid baby
isn't compatible
with a human body.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.750
[exhales]

40:25.380 --> 40:27.330
[wind blowing]

40:49.710 --> 40:51.710
[wind blowing]
