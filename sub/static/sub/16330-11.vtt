WEBVTT

00:01.132 --> 00:03.092
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:03.127 --> 00:05.093
I got the chance to start over again.

00:05.128 --> 00:07.260
Now, you will too.

00:07.356 --> 00:09.784
Shepherd is planning something
that Roman knows about.

00:09.847 --> 00:11.999
That is how we bring down Sandstorm.

00:12.093 --> 00:14.354
(Nas) It's a phone that
my source at Sandstorm

00:14.440 --> 00:15.900
managed to get to our dead drop.

00:15.902 --> 00:18.037
Relax. Please.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.487
What are you doing?

00:22.575 --> 00:23.456
<i>How does it look?</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:25.504
(Weller) Sandstorm did a practice run.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.437
Oh, my God. Look at her neck.

00:27.515 --> 00:29.547
- It's an extra tattoo.
- Why the hell would Sandstorm

00:29.608 --> 00:30.981
remove that one?

00:33.046 --> 00:36.013
(boy) Let me out! Let me out!

00:38.185 --> 00:39.893
(boy) No, please, no!

00:41.103 --> 00:43.060
Will you kill your rabbit now?

00:43.225 --> 00:44.895
That's what I thought.

00:44.897 --> 00:46.697
No! Let me out!

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

00:57.420 --> 00:59.859
The guard said you didn't
eat dinner last night.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.651
I'm not hungry.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.013
You've been saying that every day

01:03.071 --> 01:04.711
for the last two weeks.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.181
I can bring you something different.

01:07.346 --> 01:08.713
Anything you want.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.706
Did you have that same memory again?

01:13.543 --> 01:14.809
The orphanage?

01:14.893 --> 01:16.206
I can't get out.

01:17.966 --> 01:21.907
I just wanna get out and... go home.

01:23.158 --> 01:24.533
Wherever that is.

01:24.687 --> 01:27.078
I know what it's like to feel trapped.

01:27.113 --> 01:28.707
Then get me outta here!

01:34.808 --> 01:37.405
_

01:39.635 --> 01:40.971
What are you doing here?

01:41.220 --> 01:43.076
I thought you had a doctor's
appointment with Allie.

01:43.141 --> 01:45.946
Just made a little detour to see where
you've been sneaking off to every morning.

01:45.948 --> 01:48.082
Oh, I'd hardly call it sneaking.

01:48.084 --> 01:49.412
You're a very heavy sleeper.

01:49.447 --> 01:51.118
- (chuckles) Am I?
- Yeah.

01:51.157 --> 01:52.931
If you're considering going in there,

01:52.978 --> 01:55.576
you're a lot more Hindu than I am Catholic.

01:55.646 --> 01:57.681
I'm waiting for word from my inside source.

01:57.716 --> 01:59.924
From Sandstorm?

01:59.959 --> 02:02.824
I thought you said they went
dark before Jane showed up.

02:02.910 --> 02:05.130
They did. But before that,

02:05.216 --> 02:08.179
they sent me coded messages
through this marquee.

02:08.257 --> 02:09.612
I still check it every morning.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.600
Your source might have been burned.

02:12.756 --> 02:15.256
I don't think it's very
safe to keep coming here.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.689
There's a Hindu goddess called Kali

02:17.783 --> 02:21.280
who rampages through the
world destroying demons.

02:21.389 --> 02:23.987
She means well, but eventually,

02:24.057 --> 02:28.347
she goes mad with bloodlust
and almost destroys the world.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.798
That sounds like Shepherd.

02:29.875 --> 02:32.939
Until we stop her, it's not safe anywhere.

02:33.032 --> 02:35.679
And right now, we've got
practically nothing to go on.

02:37.133 --> 02:40.150
I can't afford to stop coming here.

02:40.597 --> 02:42.530
Come on, you'll be late.

02:49.526 --> 02:51.092
(electricity crackling)

03:19.615 --> 03:20.698
I missed it, didn't I?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.166
Yeah, we just finished.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.768
I didn't think you'd make it.

03:23.770 --> 03:24.771
There's a lot going on at work.

03:24.806 --> 03:27.071
It's okay. Conor came.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.017
He made all the right faces at the parts

03:29.072 --> 03:31.142
that men can't handle about pregnancy.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.544
(Conor chuckling) Yeah.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.598
Um, Conor, can we have a minute?

03:36.633 --> 03:38.870
Yeah. Yeah, I'll go... I'll go get an Uber.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.085
- Okay.
- Thanks.

03:43.147 --> 03:45.036
I thought you were cool
with Conor coming to these.

03:45.107 --> 03:48.059
I am. That's... that's not it.

03:48.391 --> 03:51.589
It's... our baby.

03:51.657 --> 03:53.691
And I hate missing these things.

03:53.761 --> 03:55.892
Yeah, I... I need to
talk to you about that.

03:55.963 --> 03:57.935
You don't have to say it.

03:58.591 --> 04:02.183
I'll do better. I promise.

04:02.272 --> 04:03.972
I won't miss another one.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.488
Hey! Welcome back.

04:13.523 --> 04:14.351
Hey.

04:15.328 --> 04:16.915
Are you feeling back to normal?

04:16.988 --> 04:19.666
Pretty much. What'd I miss?

04:19.701 --> 04:21.488
Not much... turns out Borden's a mole,

04:21.524 --> 04:23.608
Jane's brother's a prisoner downstairs,

04:23.643 --> 04:26.358
and they caught that
rat in the locker room.

04:26.423 --> 04:28.132
They caught my boy, Whitey Bulger?

04:32.162 --> 04:34.095
(sighs)

04:34.274 --> 04:36.036
Tasha, I was on pain
meds. My head was cloudy.

04:36.113 --> 04:37.247
I know, I know.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.565
We're cool, right?

04:43.655 --> 04:44.896
100%.

04:46.612 --> 04:47.778
I'm gonna go check on Patterson...

04:47.813 --> 04:49.605
I gotta catch up on these files.

04:55.459 --> 04:56.759
Reade's back.

04:57.275 --> 04:59.085
Yeah? How's he doing?

04:59.120 --> 05:01.008
I think the time off did him some good.

05:01.063 --> 05:02.902
I'm not taking time off.

05:02.937 --> 05:05.090
Shepherd tortured you,
your boyfriend shot you,

05:05.125 --> 05:07.724
then tried to lethal injection you.

05:07.759 --> 05:10.306
I think you're entitled
to a couple of sick days.

05:11.642 --> 05:13.105
You been working on this leopard tattoo

05:13.177 --> 05:15.220
for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm

05:15.314 --> 05:17.413
left it off of Jane's
body because it is a dud.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.938
Or maybe they realized
it left them exposed.

05:20.001 --> 05:22.336
All right. You gotten anywhere?

05:22.414 --> 05:24.984
No. Zero progress.

05:25.039 --> 05:28.050
I just... I have this piercing headache,

05:28.085 --> 05:29.864
and I can't seem to think straight.

05:29.927 --> 05:31.958
"For extreme fast-acting pain relief."

05:31.993 --> 05:33.874
Yeah, none of those words are accurate.

05:33.909 --> 05:35.826
Okay, here's an idea. Go home.

05:35.872 --> 05:38.033
Seriously.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.937
(tablet pinging)

05:41.118 --> 05:42.817
- Oh, we got a hit.
- _

05:42.991 --> 05:44.482
- On the leopard?
- No.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.776
Something else.

05:45.870 --> 05:46.886
You have to.

05:46.965 --> 05:48.728
Keeping Roman in that cage is torture.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.864
The alternative is Pellington
handing him over to the CIA.

05:51.974 --> 05:52.822
You know what they would do.

05:52.877 --> 05:55.400
Put him under guard at a
safehouse, you did it for me.

05:55.470 --> 05:57.424
Roman is not you, Jane, all right?

05:57.459 --> 06:00.007
He helped kill 12 FBI agents.

06:00.086 --> 06:01.899
He nearly killed Nas and Reade.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.071
Look, that was before
Jane wiped his memory.

06:04.134 --> 06:07.447
After that, he took out four Sandstorm
operatives without batting an eye.

06:07.482 --> 06:09.998
The only thing that he seems
to remember is how to kill.

06:10.033 --> 06:11.947
Shepherd is still out there,

06:11.982 --> 06:14.086
preparing to execute Phase Two,

06:14.121 --> 06:16.976
a catastrophic attack we
still know nothing about,

06:17.046 --> 06:18.921
and Roman is our only solid lead.

06:18.982 --> 06:22.407
And we will continue interrogating him
until he recovers actionable memories!

06:22.482 --> 06:23.553
And you won't get any,

06:23.657 --> 06:25.158
because as long as he's
locked up in that cage,

06:25.252 --> 06:29.359
the only thing he's going to remember
is that cell in the orphanage.

06:29.394 --> 06:31.051
Kurt, the only way I got my memories back

06:31.137 --> 06:32.596
was through action, outside in the field.

06:32.631 --> 06:33.877
Jane, I'm not letting him out.

06:33.932 --> 06:36.098
I might know someone who can help, okay?

06:36.100 --> 06:38.780
A criminal profiler I used
to work with at the NSA.

06:38.863 --> 06:40.596
I could ask her if she'd be willing

06:40.644 --> 06:42.473
to work with Roman, try
to knock something loose.

06:42.508 --> 06:43.707
I work with him every day.

06:43.785 --> 06:45.986
If anyone could get him to
remember, it would be me.

06:46.064 --> 06:48.650
Let's get some fresh eyes on
this, that's all I'm saying.

06:48.721 --> 06:50.321
All right, see what you can do, Nas.

06:52.363 --> 06:53.800
Patterson's got something.

06:57.288 --> 06:59.121
All right, these torus tattoos

06:59.226 --> 07:01.744
are like fraternal twins, mostly similar.

07:01.806 --> 07:03.479
But if you look closely at the differences

07:03.565 --> 07:06.003
and drop them into a
grid, the symbols create

07:06.081 --> 07:08.889
an alphanumeric sequence.
I found 11 grids worth.

07:08.924 --> 07:10.415
Well, you showed us this the
first time you cracked it.

07:10.485 --> 07:12.046
- That's a shipping container ID.
- Hey!

07:12.081 --> 07:14.355
Reade with a three-pointer
fresh off the bench.

07:14.425 --> 07:17.107
I flagged it back then,
and finally got a hit.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.518
The container offloaded
at the Red Hook Terminal.

07:19.588 --> 07:22.681
So, Sandstorm wanted us to keep
an eye out for this container.

07:22.716 --> 07:25.128
- What was in it?
- Not what. Who.

07:25.246 --> 07:27.289
Two whos, to be precise.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.224
They tried to scramble
the security cameras,

07:29.303 --> 07:31.805
but I was able to reverse
the signal interference.

07:31.914 --> 07:34.229
I can't ID the younger
guy, but the older one...

07:34.283 --> 07:35.805
- Is that...?
- (Reade) Anton Stepulov.

07:35.868 --> 07:38.298
(Weller) No, that's impossible. He's dead.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.716
The drone strike took him out a year ago.

07:39.781 --> 07:42.208
According to this, he's alive and
well and somewhere in Brooklyn.

07:42.279 --> 07:43.942
Stepulov's Dabbur Zann's number two.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.142
They call him the mastermind.

07:45.204 --> 07:47.403
He orchestrated the campus
massacres in Santiago.

07:47.449 --> 07:48.795
And the Oslo newspaper bombing.

07:48.850 --> 07:50.872
Not to mention the Black Sea incident

07:50.977 --> 07:54.218
where the Dabbur Zann almost,
you know, beheaded you guys.

07:54.295 --> 07:56.660
So, it's safe to say he's not
here for "Hamilton" tickets.

07:56.695 --> 07:58.737
The last time the Dabbur
Zann was in the US,

07:58.784 --> 08:00.632
they tried to detonate a suitcase nuke.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.348
Stepulov's basically their
leader, he wouldn't risk

08:02.411 --> 08:04.168
crossing a border unless
it really mattered.

08:04.203 --> 08:06.393
(Weller) If he's here,
he's planning something big.

08:06.475 --> 08:08.262
And it looks like it's about to go down.

08:11.475 --> 08:14.009
♪♪

08:16.847 --> 08:21.847
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

08:27.509 --> 08:30.371
Hey, no increased chatter about
Dabbur Zann activity in the US,

08:30.427 --> 08:33.071
but forensics found traces of
nitroglycerin inside the container.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.039
That's a down and dirty
way to make explosives.

08:35.131 --> 08:36.746
So, you think Stepulov smuggled in a bomb?

08:36.823 --> 08:39.745
That'd be my guess. First, we have
to ID his target before he strikes.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.947
We tracked down the company
that paid the freight

08:41.948 --> 08:43.515
on Stepulov's container.

08:43.517 --> 08:45.851
It's buried in a web of shell companies.

08:45.853 --> 08:48.253
Long story short, the same people wired

08:48.255 --> 08:51.390
$250,000 to a woman in
Baychester last week.

08:51.392 --> 08:52.725
Arlene Turner.

08:52.727 --> 08:53.792
(Zapata) Single, no criminal record.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.227
Not so much as a library fine.

08:55.229 --> 08:56.695
How does a woman like that get tied up

08:56.697 --> 08:57.863
with someone like Stepulov?

08:57.865 --> 08:59.798
She's homegrown. She can blend in.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.367
And the Dabbur Zann has been increasing

09:01.369 --> 09:02.968
their recruitment of Americans.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.703
Let's bring her in for a chat.

09:06.073 --> 09:07.706
How do you know Anton Stepulov?

09:07.708 --> 09:09.608
Who?

09:09.610 --> 09:12.244
The Dabbur Zann terrorist that wired you

09:12.246 --> 09:14.613
a quarter of a million dollars.

09:16.283 --> 09:18.083
- What's he paying you for?
- Well, no, this is...

09:18.085 --> 09:19.885
this money is life insurance.

09:19.887 --> 09:22.121
My brother Paul, he had kidney disease.

09:22.123 --> 09:24.390
He died in the hospital last week.

09:25.626 --> 09:29.128
Last time I saw him, he kept talking about

09:29.130 --> 09:31.830
how his death would have so much meaning.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.565
Did you ask him what he meant?

09:33.567 --> 09:36.802
He was on a morphine drip,
saying all kinds of things.

09:36.804 --> 09:38.437
You said he died in the hospital.

09:38.439 --> 09:41.740
- Did you see the body?
- No. I wa...

09:41.742 --> 09:43.809
The hospital called and told me

09:43.811 --> 09:45.310
that he had passed.

09:45.312 --> 09:46.979
By the time I had gotten there,

09:46.981 --> 09:48.981
he had already been taken to the morgue.

09:54.789 --> 09:56.288
You think she's telling the truth?

09:56.290 --> 09:58.924
Partly. Paul Turner was
a patient at Edgewater.

09:58.926 --> 10:00.626
Their system logged a notice of death.

10:00.628 --> 10:02.261
But this is really weird.

10:02.263 --> 10:04.329
Someone also signed a form

10:04.331 --> 10:06.632
to transfer him to a private hospital.

10:06.634 --> 10:08.200
So, he left there alive.

10:08.202 --> 10:10.002
A terminally ill man tells his sister

10:10.004 --> 10:11.870
his death will have meaning,
then secures a major payday

10:11.872 --> 10:13.539
from the Dabbur Zann?

10:13.541 --> 10:15.307
You think the Dabbur Zann
could have been paying him

10:15.309 --> 10:17.443
to be a suicide bomber?

10:17.445 --> 10:19.611
I wanna know who took Paul
Turner from that hospital.

10:19.613 --> 10:21.413
Yeah, on it.

10:28.122 --> 10:29.688
(beeping)

10:33.227 --> 10:34.493
What's this?

10:34.495 --> 10:37.796
Well, when my memory was wiped, I was...

10:37.798 --> 10:41.333
I was a complete mystery, even to myself.

10:41.335 --> 10:46.472
And... someone, uh... told me to start

10:46.474 --> 10:49.875
with small choices, like coffee or tea.

10:49.877 --> 10:52.911
Looks like you chose for me.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.580
Well, you like coffee

10:54.582 --> 10:56.415
with as much sugar as it'll hold.

10:56.417 --> 11:00.185
(chuckles) I know you.

11:00.187 --> 11:05.324
So... unlike me, you don't
have to start from scratch.

11:08.996 --> 11:11.497
Did our mother love us?

11:13.434 --> 11:17.002
I think so. In her own way.

11:19.507 --> 11:22.741
Then why would she wipe my memory?

11:22.743 --> 11:26.311
Um... maybe...

11:28.549 --> 11:32.684
maybe she thought it was the only chance

11:32.686 --> 11:35.454
she had left to get you back.

11:40.294 --> 11:42.461
The hospital log shows four people

11:42.463 --> 11:44.029
visited Paul Turner.

11:44.031 --> 11:47.032
One of them used an alias,
and his last visit was on

11:47.034 --> 11:49.701
the same day the hospital
told Arlene her brother died.

11:49.703 --> 11:51.103
So, this guy took Turner.

11:51.105 --> 11:52.771
I looked through the security footage,

11:52.773 --> 11:55.073
and I found someone taking
Turner away in a black Tahoe.

11:55.075 --> 11:56.408
Did you run the plates?

11:56.410 --> 11:58.477
Did I run the plates? Two minutes ago,

11:58.479 --> 12:00.412
it passed through a tollbooth coming out

12:00.414 --> 12:01.914
of the midtown tunnel
on its way to the BQE.

12:01.916 --> 12:03.415
(Reade) That's ten minutes from here.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.284
So, Turner could be in
that car with Stepulov

12:05.286 --> 12:07.653
and whatever bomb he
smuggled into this country.

12:07.655 --> 12:09.154
Let's move.

12:20.234 --> 12:23.202
(tires screeching)

12:24.271 --> 12:25.470
Get out of the car!

12:25.472 --> 12:26.939
Get out of the car! Show me your hands

12:26.941 --> 12:28.173
and get out of the car.

12:28.175 --> 12:29.808
(Zapata) Hands up.

12:29.810 --> 12:32.010
(Weller) Anton Stepulov...

12:32.012 --> 12:34.646
you're under arrest.

12:34.648 --> 12:37.816
Both of you, keep your
hands where I can see 'em.

12:37.818 --> 12:39.651
You've been here for three months.

12:39.653 --> 12:42.154
How much longer are you gonna
make us do this to you, Jane?

12:42.156 --> 12:43.222
Nooo!

12:44.491 --> 12:46.158
What are you doing here?

12:47.861 --> 12:50.429
Lower your guns. Everyone,
just lower your guns.

12:50.431 --> 12:52.464
What are you doing? Are
you working with him?

12:52.466 --> 12:55.934
Yeah, so lower your weapon.
He's a guest of the CIA.

12:57.705 --> 12:59.271
Weller!

12:59.273 --> 13:01.139
It looks like they have a bioweapon.

13:01.141 --> 13:03.008
- Everyone back!
- Just relax!

13:03.010 --> 13:05.310
Everyone, just relax. It's not a weapon.

13:05.312 --> 13:07.546
It's a human heart.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.724
This is the man who tortured
me at the black site.

13:18.759 --> 13:20.810
Enhanced interrogation. He knows.

13:20.845 --> 13:22.453
Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?

13:22.488 --> 13:24.539
I thought you said you
didn't know anything...

13:24.586 --> 13:27.788
I didn't, Jane. We met in Bulgaria.

13:28.861 --> 13:31.162
How exactly is Stepulov a guest to the CIA?

13:31.164 --> 13:33.898
That young man is Henrik, Stepulov's son.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.332
He was born with a bad ticker.

13:35.334 --> 13:36.901
He needs a transplant, or he'll die.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.969
The nitroglycerin, it was heart medication.

13:38.971 --> 13:41.972
The shipping containers, the
shell companies, they're CIA.

13:41.974 --> 13:44.041
So, you murdered Paul
Turner for his organs.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.010
Okay, easy. Turner was dying.

13:46.012 --> 13:48.712
He donated his heart, we
provided for his family.

13:48.714 --> 13:50.748
You didn't answer my question.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.484
Okay, look, I've been
baiting Stepulov for months.

13:53.486 --> 13:55.853
A heart for Henrik in
exchange for actionable intel.

13:55.855 --> 13:58.489
I thought we didn't
negotiate with terrorists.

13:58.491 --> 14:00.391
She is adorable.

14:02.161 --> 14:04.728
Stepulov finally gave me something.

14:04.730 --> 14:06.697
A Dabbur Zann attack on New York,

14:06.699 --> 14:08.599
tonight at 6:00 p.m.

14:08.601 --> 14:10.768
But he won't give up the target
until Henrik's out of surgery,

14:10.770 --> 14:12.169
so we're kind of on a clock here, pal.

14:12.171 --> 14:13.737
No, Kurt, you can't trust him.

14:13.739 --> 14:15.506
Oh, does the FBI wanna tell that

14:15.508 --> 14:18.509
to the thousands of Americans
whose lives are at stake?

14:18.511 --> 14:22.079
You're on US soil. That's FBI jurisdiction.

14:22.081 --> 14:24.415
Our building has a
first-class medical suite.

14:24.417 --> 14:27.117
We do the surgery there.

14:27.119 --> 14:29.520
All right, that's fine, man.

14:29.522 --> 14:31.021
You can be the boss.

14:35.061 --> 14:36.794
Stepulov's under guard in the waiting room.

14:36.796 --> 14:38.896
But he's still not talking
till his son's out of surgery.

14:38.898 --> 14:40.764
(Reade) Are we seriously gonna sit
on our hands while the Dabbur Zann

14:40.766 --> 14:42.866
plans to kill thousands of people tonight?

14:42.868 --> 14:45.035
We took Stepulov's phone
and laptop when he arrived.

14:45.037 --> 14:46.470
If we can crack 'em,

14:46.472 --> 14:47.972
maybe we can get a lead on the attack.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.974
(Weller) Okay, Patterson
will run point on that.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.610
Reade, Tasha, have
another crack at Stepulov,

14:52.612 --> 14:54.478
see if he'll talk now, okay?

14:54.480 --> 14:56.780
You know, I think I should
go help Patterson, too.

14:56.782 --> 14:59.550
Okay, fine. Go help her.

14:59.552 --> 15:01.385
Keaton, you work out of here.

15:07.627 --> 15:11.028
We never got to finish
what you started in Oregon.

15:13.065 --> 15:14.965
What I started?

15:14.967 --> 15:18.302
I don't hurt people unless I have to.

15:18.304 --> 15:19.770
- I'm not like you.
- Says the daughter

15:19.772 --> 15:22.139
of the biggest domestic terrorist

15:22.141 --> 15:23.774
in American history.

15:23.776 --> 15:25.609
You think that I wanted to be there?

15:25.611 --> 15:27.144
Do you know how many

15:27.146 --> 15:29.413
of my daughter's basketball
games I've missed?

15:29.415 --> 15:30.981
Dinners with my wife?

15:30.983 --> 15:33.450
I'd rather be doing anything
than interrogating you.

15:33.452 --> 15:35.986
(scoffs) Interrogating me?

15:35.988 --> 15:38.088
You <i>tortured</i> me,

15:38.090 --> 15:39.990
held me captive without charge.

15:39.992 --> 15:44.128
I was ordered to extract
intel from an enemy combatant.

15:44.130 --> 15:47.031
It wasn't personal. You people around here,

15:47.033 --> 15:48.465
you don't seem to know the difference.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.768
And you are still
responsible for your actions.

15:50.770 --> 15:54.705
My actions... don't officially exist,

15:54.707 --> 15:56.507
any more than you do.

15:56.509 --> 16:00.511
We're just blacked out lines
in some government report.

16:03.215 --> 16:05.649
How can you work with Keaton
after what he did to me?

16:05.651 --> 16:07.318
We don't have a choice.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.053
Yeah, he just lectured me
about not having a choice

16:09.055 --> 16:10.821
- when he tortured me.
- I don't like it, either.

16:10.823 --> 16:12.156
And for the record,

16:12.158 --> 16:14.224
I almost snapped his neck when I found out.

16:15.695 --> 16:18.462
I didn't know.

16:18.464 --> 16:20.631
Thank you.

16:20.633 --> 16:22.333
For what?

16:22.335 --> 16:25.069
Almost killing someone in cold blood?

16:27.206 --> 16:30.641
This is Dr. Karen Sun, the
profiler I told you about.

16:30.643 --> 16:32.543
I'm keen to assess your prisoner.

16:32.545 --> 16:34.478
You mean, the patient.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.247
You're obviously the
sister. I read the file.

16:37.249 --> 16:40.217
Well, then, you know what
the patient is capable of.

16:40.219 --> 16:42.052
It's not my first dance with a killer.

16:42.054 --> 16:44.521
(Nas) Karen is board
certified in psychiatry

16:44.523 --> 16:46.924
with a specialization in PTSD.

16:46.926 --> 16:48.692
Can you unblock memories?

16:48.694 --> 16:51.095
My methods tap the connection
between the mind and body

16:51.097 --> 16:53.030
in highly traumatized individuals.

16:53.032 --> 16:54.998
I'm confident I can.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.200
I'll take you to get started.

16:56.202 --> 16:57.568
I'd like to sit in.

16:57.570 --> 16:59.169
- Roman trusts me.
- No.

16:59.171 --> 17:01.105
Your presence will contaminate the process.

17:01.107 --> 17:04.040
Jane, look, your brother
is in very good hands.

17:04.042 --> 17:05.275
I promise you.

17:12.718 --> 17:15.018
Hey, I thought you could use a break.

17:15.020 --> 17:18.388
Yeah, this guy is all stare and no talk.

17:18.391 --> 17:20.190
I'm gonna check on Patterson.

17:20.192 --> 17:21.657
(Jane) Okay.

17:25.297 --> 17:27.030
How's my son?

17:27.031 --> 17:29.099
Still in surgery.

17:32.938 --> 17:35.038
You wanna capture a real terrorist,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.941
put your handcuffs on this man Keaton.

17:37.943 --> 17:39.943
Can't say I disagree.

17:43.616 --> 17:47.584
(sighs) To use a man's son like this,

17:47.586 --> 17:49.286
unforgiveable.

17:49.288 --> 17:50.921
Well, you didn't have to say yes.

17:50.923 --> 17:52.356
Really?

17:57.430 --> 18:00.964
On top of his illness, Henrik
has <i>situs inversus.</i>

18:00.966 --> 18:03.967
His heart is on the wrong side of his body.

18:03.969 --> 18:07.404
Do you know how many surgeons
can do a transplant like this?

18:10.576 --> 18:12.743
Keaton found her.

18:15.748 --> 18:19.650
My son is not Dabbur Zann.

18:19.652 --> 18:22.786
He deserves a life.

18:22.788 --> 18:25.189
(sighs)

18:25.191 --> 18:27.324
One he chooses.

18:29.028 --> 18:31.195
What's your name?

18:31.197 --> 18:32.963
Jane.

18:32.965 --> 18:36.400
What's the worst thing that
can happen to a man, Jane?

18:38.437 --> 18:40.304
To lose a child.

18:40.306 --> 18:42.873
(phone beeping)

18:44.285 --> 18:45.643
_

18:45.678 --> 18:47.644
Henrik?

18:47.646 --> 18:49.847
Another case.

18:58.390 --> 19:01.325
Henrik just died on the operating table.

19:01.327 --> 19:04.161
(Jane) So, now what?

19:04.163 --> 19:05.529
The Dabbur Zann attack is scheduled

19:05.531 --> 19:06.997
for 6:00 p.m. tonight.

19:06.999 --> 19:09.199
We just lost our only leverage.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.861
Once Stepulov finds out his son's dead,

19:19.933 --> 19:21.598
he'll never give us
the intel on the attack.

19:21.654 --> 19:22.806
(Keaton) We have to lie.

19:22.841 --> 19:24.701
We'll tell him Henrik's in recovery,

19:24.754 --> 19:25.820
he's too weak for visitors.

19:25.882 --> 19:28.178
No, he won't accept that,
he already doesn't trust us.

19:28.258 --> 19:31.039
- Doesn't trust you.
- We have nothing else to offer.

19:31.884 --> 19:33.717
Look, he'll figure it out eventually.

19:33.719 --> 19:35.552
And when he does, he'll blame us.

19:35.554 --> 19:39.723
Tasha, Reade, go check in with Patterson.

19:39.725 --> 19:43.260
Jane, Keaton, let's go and
have a talk with Stepulov.

19:46.957 --> 19:48.924
Over? Is he okay?

19:48.926 --> 19:50.258
I want to see him now. Take me to him...

19:50.260 --> 19:52.427
Hey, hey, hey. He's in recovery, all right?

19:52.429 --> 19:53.795
We did what we promised.

19:53.797 --> 19:55.263
Now, you need to keep
your end of the bargain.

19:55.265 --> 19:56.531
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Yeah.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.233
I want to see him first.

19:58.235 --> 19:59.968
Look, he's in isolation, okay?

19:59.970 --> 20:01.770
These kinds of transplants,
they can challenge...

20:01.772 --> 20:03.472
Your son died.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.777
He had a stroke during surgery.

20:08.779 --> 20:11.780
They did everything that they could.

20:11.782 --> 20:14.449
His body just shut down.

20:14.451 --> 20:16.017
I'm sorry.

20:19.423 --> 20:21.022
No.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.228
No. No. No, we...

20:27.631 --> 20:29.431
we came here because you...

20:29.433 --> 20:31.333
- Stop, stop it.
- You go to your doctor...

20:31.335 --> 20:33.001
- Easy.
- ...and you make him save him!

20:33.003 --> 20:34.136
- Understand?
- Stop.

20:34.138 --> 20:36.037
- No!
- Stop!

20:37.608 --> 20:39.508
She tried her best.

20:39.510 --> 20:43.745
Your son was very sick. I'm... I'm sorry.

20:45.449 --> 20:46.815
I know that you loved him.

20:46.817 --> 20:51.620
But what would he do in this situation?

20:51.622 --> 20:53.989
You told me that Henrik
wasn't a part of your group,

20:53.991 --> 20:56.958
so I'm guessing...

20:56.960 --> 20:59.361
his ideals aren't like yours.

21:01.098 --> 21:03.265
Please.

21:03.267 --> 21:06.535
Tell us where the attack
is going to happen.

21:07.938 --> 21:09.504
For him.

21:12.543 --> 21:14.876
You murder my son.

21:17.514 --> 21:20.682
Then you expect me to help you?

21:20.684 --> 21:23.051
Hm?

21:23.053 --> 21:25.487
Tonight...

21:25.489 --> 21:29.024
at 6:00 p.m.,

21:29.026 --> 21:32.260
this city will feel my pain.

21:34.731 --> 21:40.101
And there is nothing you can do to stop it.

21:43.373 --> 21:45.507
We cracked Stepulov's phone,

21:45.509 --> 21:47.709
he sent a coded text message
when the ship reached port.

21:47.711 --> 21:49.845
And we assume it went to one
of the Dabbur Zann associates.

21:49.847 --> 21:51.179
- What'd it say?
- We're still not sure,

21:51.181 --> 21:52.514
but the phone on the receiving end

21:52.516 --> 21:54.716
was at an industrial
block on Kent and Sixth.

21:54.718 --> 21:56.384
- (Reade) They could still be there.
- Let's go.

21:56.386 --> 21:58.320
- No.
- It's my case.

21:58.322 --> 22:00.822
Stepulov was your case. So you stay here.

22:00.824 --> 22:02.757
Try to get him to talk when he cools down.

22:02.759 --> 22:04.459
Let's move.

22:07.264 --> 22:08.830
I should meet Roman alone.

22:08.832 --> 22:10.665
Look, I want to be there
in case he remembers

22:10.667 --> 22:12.667
something important.

22:12.669 --> 22:15.470
When have I ever kept
relevant intel from you?

22:18.075 --> 22:19.608
(beep)

22:26.358 --> 22:28.225
Hello, Roman.

22:29.328 --> 22:31.761
My name is Karen.

22:31.763 --> 22:34.097
The people here have
asked me to speak with you,

22:34.099 --> 22:36.333
help you recall your past.

22:36.335 --> 22:39.202
I already told them everything I remember.

22:39.204 --> 22:42.606
The cell in the orphanage,
can you tell me about it?

22:42.608 --> 22:45.509
I'm not saying another word
until I get what I want.

22:45.511 --> 22:48.011
- Which is?
- Out!

22:48.013 --> 22:50.772
I don't belong in here!

22:50.807 --> 22:52.173
How can you be sure?

22:54.745 --> 22:57.145
You don't know who you
are, where you're from,

22:57.147 --> 22:59.447
or what you've done...
maybe you do belong in there.

23:01.151 --> 23:03.585
You have one, single paralyzing memory

23:03.587 --> 23:05.420
of being stuck in that orphanage,

23:05.422 --> 23:08.256
and walking out of here
isn't going to help.

23:08.258 --> 23:10.358
Let me help you, Roman.

23:12.996 --> 23:15.730
Or stay stuck here in this room,

23:15.732 --> 23:17.165
and in your mind.

23:24.808 --> 23:28.143
What happens when Roman
finds out that I lied to him?

23:28.145 --> 23:31.112
That I was the one that wiped his memory?

23:31.114 --> 23:33.615
He'll never trust me again.

23:33.617 --> 23:35.450
I'd say getting your memory wiped

23:35.452 --> 23:37.352
was the best thing that
ever happened to you.

23:37.354 --> 23:40.455
Think about who you
were and who you are now.

23:40.457 --> 23:43.258
You got a chance to start over.

23:43.260 --> 23:44.859
And now, Roman does.

23:44.861 --> 23:48.997
This morning, you said
Roman wasn't like me.

23:48.999 --> 23:51.366
All I know is Roman is
alive because of you.

23:51.368 --> 23:56.171
Whatever hope that he has left
is a gift that you gave him.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.382
So, how long you figure
it'll be weird between us?

24:07.384 --> 24:08.717
Look, I'm not the one who tried to make out

24:08.719 --> 24:10.318
with my best friend,
so don't put this on me.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.820
It's not like I'm in
love with you or anything.

24:11.822 --> 24:14.222
I was in a bad place. It was stupid.

24:14.224 --> 24:17.025
- (chuckling)
- So, now, we just gotta work through it.

24:17.027 --> 24:19.394
I'm already through it. Now, can
we please stop talking about it?

24:19.396 --> 24:22.197
(Weller on radio) <i>All right,
guys, we're pulling up now.</i>

24:22.199 --> 24:24.065
<i>Patterson traced the
Dabbur Zann phone</i>

24:24.067 --> 24:25.967
<i>to somewhere in this vicinity.</i>

24:31.141 --> 24:33.141
All right, Tasha, Reade,
go around the back.

24:33.143 --> 24:34.409
Start there.

24:34.411 --> 24:35.977
Jane, start through the front.

24:35.979 --> 24:38.580
I'm going around the side.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.053
Excuse me?

24:46.056 --> 24:48.490
Sir!

24:48.492 --> 24:51.426
Sir, stop!

24:51.428 --> 24:53.728
(truck revs)

24:58.101 --> 24:59.434
Uhh!

25:06.443 --> 25:09.678
Weller! Are you okay?

25:09.680 --> 25:10.779
(Zapata) What the hell happened?

25:10.781 --> 25:12.380
I'm fine.

25:12.382 --> 25:14.215
That was a pretty big bomb.

25:14.217 --> 25:17.352
And the Dabbur Zann have a
truck that's full of them.

25:25.914 --> 25:29.092
(indistinct chatter)

25:29.127 --> 25:30.393
From the looks of it, this guy's pumping

25:30.395 --> 25:32.005
explosive gases into the basketballs.

25:32.076 --> 25:33.425
Propane and acetone peroxide.

25:33.487 --> 25:35.715
He must have wired it through
an initiator charge on the rack.

25:35.750 --> 25:37.746
That truck was full of those basketballs.

25:37.848 --> 25:39.477
Wherever he's going, he
wants to kill a lot of people.

25:39.512 --> 25:40.804
Yeah, but why basketballs?

25:40.839 --> 25:42.564
Maybe they're targeting an arena.

25:42.599 --> 25:44.891
There are no NBA or college games tonight.

25:44.926 --> 25:47.708
Patterson, send agents
to every major venue.

25:47.786 --> 25:50.422
All right, let's start
crossing off potential targets.

25:50.484 --> 25:52.647
Know what's the worst thing
that can happen to a man?

25:52.733 --> 25:54.185
It's lose a child.

25:54.247 --> 25:56.169
Wait, didn't you say your
daughter plays basketball?

25:56.204 --> 25:59.521
Does she have a game tonight?

25:59.556 --> 26:02.325
Youth League Nationals. At City Rec.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.552
There are hundreds of kids
and parents at that tournament.

26:04.587 --> 26:06.346
It's 5:30. We got half an hour

26:06.386 --> 26:08.205
before they start setting off those bombs.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.286
This is where your trauma is.

26:14.288 --> 26:15.481
Now, try again.

26:15.536 --> 26:18.257
Go into that room in your drawings.

26:18.566 --> 26:19.592
You were scratching at the door.

26:19.594 --> 26:21.026
Is that how you get out?

26:21.278 --> 26:22.690
I don't know.

26:22.725 --> 26:24.396
Fight or flight is a natural instinct,

26:24.398 --> 26:27.177
but you can't do either
of them in that cell.

26:27.269 --> 26:28.602
Try again.

26:30.569 --> 26:32.385
I can't do it.

26:32.536 --> 26:35.537
I can feel that room, but...

26:35.673 --> 26:37.158
I ca... I can't.

26:37.208 --> 26:39.344
It's... it's too dark.

26:40.646 --> 26:41.812
Kill the lights.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.461
(keys jingling)

26:47.886 --> 26:49.118
(man) Time's up.

26:54.837 --> 26:57.780
What you got? Another coin?

26:57.914 --> 26:59.076
Give it!

26:59.111 --> 27:01.412
(knife slashing, boy grunting)

27:13.027 --> 27:15.094
Did you get out?

27:15.306 --> 27:16.905
(whispers) Yeah.

27:20.218 --> 27:22.084
This is payback.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.966
Stepulov's targeting Erin because
I used his son as leverage.

27:25.001 --> 27:26.333
No, not just your daughter.

27:26.402 --> 27:29.227
There are hundreds of civilians in
there, people from all over the country.

27:29.316 --> 27:30.982
It must have been his plan all along.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.927
And he gave us the time of the attack
so he could call it off if his son lived,

27:34.013 --> 27:36.628
or not if he died...
it's a perfect revenge.

27:36.690 --> 27:39.129
Okay, okay, look, we just
have to evacuate the building.

27:39.164 --> 27:40.657
No, we don't.

27:40.719 --> 27:42.078
We've still got 20 minutes.

27:42.149 --> 27:43.491
An evacuation could cause panic

27:43.555 --> 27:46.142
or make the Dabbur Zann
set off the attack earlier.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.965
Do you have kids, Weller?

27:49.693 --> 27:50.874
One on the way.

27:51.741 --> 27:53.653
I won't let them hurt my daughter.

27:54.695 --> 27:56.246
I understand.

27:56.416 --> 27:59.732
We'll go in there together,
and we'll stop this attack,

27:59.836 --> 28:03.119
and we'll save your daughter, okay?

28:03.465 --> 28:04.798
(whispers) Yeah.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.073
(phone beeping)

28:09.108 --> 28:11.541
(cheering)

28:16.229 --> 28:17.595
(indistinct chatter)

28:22.791 --> 28:24.915
Stacy, what's going on? My game's not done.

28:24.985 --> 28:26.451
Listen, just keep moving, Erin.

28:27.353 --> 28:28.920
- (door rattling)
- What's wrong?

28:28.976 --> 28:30.555
- It's locked.
- (silenced gunshot)

28:30.557 --> 28:32.256
(screams)

28:32.406 --> 28:34.306
Found the girl.

28:34.441 --> 28:36.256
Yes, I understand, alive.

28:44.428 --> 28:47.196
Bomb techs, report to me
as soon as you see anything.

28:47.198 --> 28:48.297
Team, stay sharp.

28:48.356 --> 28:51.117
Those racks are rigged with enough
explosives to bring this whole place down.

28:51.172 --> 28:52.213
- Let's go.
- Hey.

28:52.265 --> 28:53.770
We gotta find Erin before they do.

28:53.805 --> 28:55.166
You and me will find Erin.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.368
You guys, find the explosives.

29:06.477 --> 29:08.697
FBI! Drop your weapons!

29:13.544 --> 29:16.112
♪♪

29:24.922 --> 29:26.188
(machine gun fire)

29:30.884 --> 29:33.218
Oh, my God. Reade.

29:40.414 --> 29:41.675
(Reade) Seven minutes.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.140
All right, Weller, we
gotta start evacuating.

29:43.222 --> 29:45.355
Patterson, looks like
we're gonna need help here.

29:51.812 --> 29:54.479
(both grunting)

30:00.654 --> 30:02.901
(man over PA) <i>This is an
emergency announcement.</i>

30:02.936 --> 30:03.488
<i>Please evacuate slowly...</i>

30:03.551 --> 30:05.655
(Weller) Just stay calm, keep moving.

30:05.727 --> 30:07.047
Where's Erin supposed to be right now?

30:07.133 --> 30:09.730
She should be here, but
I have an agent on her.

30:09.811 --> 30:11.921
I texted her from the
car to keep Erin safe.

30:12.058 --> 30:13.875
(phone beeping)

30:13.993 --> 30:15.035
Erin?

30:15.105 --> 30:16.251
(crying) Dad!

30:16.337 --> 30:17.972
Erin, are you okay?

30:18.049 --> 30:20.314
He shot Stacy, and now he's chasing me.

30:20.392 --> 30:22.108
Tell me where you are, I'll come get you.

30:22.143 --> 30:25.607
Um... I'm somewhere
downstairs. I don't know.

30:25.642 --> 30:27.527
<i>Help me.</i>

30:27.613 --> 30:30.392
All right, Erin, we're gonna find you.

30:30.427 --> 30:32.429
But I need you to do what I say, okay?

30:32.547 --> 30:34.719
Do you see any signs around you?

30:35.036 --> 30:36.855
Um, th-there's an exit sign

30:36.909 --> 30:39.371
and then one that says
"South Court Stairs."

30:39.433 --> 30:41.833
I want you to follow the
arrows to the South Court.

30:41.901 --> 30:43.754
- <i>We'll meet you there.</i>
- Okay.

30:43.820 --> 30:45.854
(both grunting)

30:50.492 --> 30:51.557
(bones crack)

31:13.238 --> 31:14.771
Agh!

31:16.563 --> 31:18.362
Patterson, we don't have
time to defuse them all.

31:18.364 --> 31:19.608
We need another way to stop it.

31:19.643 --> 31:21.025
Okay, okay.

31:21.072 --> 31:24.018
Uh, the rack's fitted
with a modified cell phone.

31:24.079 --> 31:26.486
An incoming call triggers the explosion.

31:26.521 --> 31:27.543
Um, okay.

31:27.603 --> 31:29.184
If I can kill the cell signal,

31:29.268 --> 31:30.514
there's no way to set off the bomb.

31:30.549 --> 31:33.315
90 seconds, how do we stop it?

31:33.441 --> 31:34.802
(Patterson) <i>Okay,
I have to make sure</i>

31:34.857 --> 31:36.960
no one can make a triggering call.

31:37.031 --> 31:38.854
I need to shut down all
the cell towers near you.

31:38.899 --> 31:41.293
- Shut down the cell towers.
- No! We'll lose contact with Erin.

31:41.363 --> 31:42.971
Those bombs go off, Erin and everyone else

31:43.026 --> 31:44.960
in here is gonna die, understand?

31:45.027 --> 31:46.726
Give me the phone.

31:49.015 --> 31:51.202
Erin, there's a locker room on your level.

31:51.267 --> 31:53.145
I want you to go in there, lock the door,

31:53.207 --> 31:54.106
and don't move.

31:54.159 --> 31:55.891
- Okay.
- <i>Go.</i>

31:55.946 --> 31:58.011
Patterson, shut 'em down.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.083
(typing furiously)

32:02.603 --> 32:03.535
(electronic beep)

32:03.597 --> 32:05.237
Did it work?

32:05.543 --> 32:07.394
(Reade) No phone service.

32:07.504 --> 32:09.103
The bombs are disabled.

32:11.986 --> 32:13.591
(Erin crying)

32:13.669 --> 32:15.718
- Erin?
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

32:15.772 --> 32:18.306
Stay back, or she dies.

32:26.755 --> 32:29.355
- (Weller) We can talk.
- Stay back or she dies!

32:30.154 --> 32:31.609
(Weller) Listen to me.

32:31.703 --> 32:33.780
No one needs to die, all right?

32:34.139 --> 32:36.037
Let her go and we can talk.

32:36.098 --> 32:38.371
I wanna talk to the CIA man, Keaton.

32:38.438 --> 32:40.104
This is his daughter.

32:41.231 --> 32:42.892
I'm Keaton.

32:42.975 --> 32:44.690
You just let her go, man, she's just a kid.

32:44.770 --> 32:47.208
Put Anton Stepulov on an airplane.

32:47.302 --> 32:49.397
When he calls from the
ground in St. Petersburg,

32:49.499 --> 32:51.067
I will let her go.

32:51.157 --> 32:54.084
- Anything else, and she dies.
- (crying)

32:54.119 --> 32:56.140
I haven't got a shot.

32:56.209 --> 32:57.206
You?

33:02.877 --> 33:04.414
Keaton... what are you doing?

33:04.488 --> 33:05.962
Take any shot you can get.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.746
Don't, Keaton. I haven't got a shot.

33:07.824 --> 33:09.319
Hey, let me take her place, all right?

33:09.390 --> 33:11.094
I'm a lot more valuable.

33:11.164 --> 33:12.465
I'll walk out of here with you right now.

33:12.528 --> 33:13.539
I'll go anywhere you wanna go.

33:13.574 --> 33:15.599
Stay back! I'll kill her!

33:15.663 --> 33:17.061
Okay, put the gun on me, man.

33:17.173 --> 33:19.784
Put the gun on me! Come on, put it on me.

33:19.854 --> 33:21.515
We can make a deal, all right?

33:21.606 --> 33:23.672
Just let her go. We can talk.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.128
Erin? It's okay.

33:30.175 --> 33:34.005
Erin, I need you to take
one step forward very slowly.

33:34.073 --> 33:35.807
- Stop!
- (gunshot)

33:45.844 --> 33:47.118
(gunshots)

33:47.470 --> 33:49.638
(Erin crying)

33:52.025 --> 33:53.437
(whispering) You're okay.

33:53.503 --> 33:56.831
You're okay. It's okay.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.215
Thank you.

34:00.283 --> 34:04.653
I was just doing my
job. It wasn't personal.

34:10.018 --> 34:12.859
I put Roman into your MRI machine,

34:12.929 --> 34:14.734
and I showed him two sets of images.

34:14.812 --> 34:16.793
Some joyful, like laughing children,

34:16.871 --> 34:20.677
and others disturbing...
illness, war zones.

34:20.739 --> 34:23.097
Unlike a normal brain,
Roman's reacted the same

34:23.197 --> 34:24.632
to both... neutrally.

34:24.699 --> 34:25.966
His memory's been wiped,

34:26.034 --> 34:27.898
his brain's not going to act normal.

34:27.953 --> 34:30.194
Automatic reactions like
that are engrained early.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.271
Amnesia would not take them away.

34:32.341 --> 34:33.902
Roman's response indicates he's suffering

34:33.996 --> 34:36.770
from extreme antisocial
personality disorder.

34:36.815 --> 34:38.295
(Weller) Can you treat him?

34:38.824 --> 34:41.018
When I was in med school, I spent a summer

34:41.096 --> 34:42.911
at an orphanage in Sudan.

34:42.984 --> 34:45.179
The place was even more
awful than you can imagine.

34:45.282 --> 34:47.888
Understaffed, undersupplied.

34:47.956 --> 34:49.483
Do you know what I heard

34:49.553 --> 34:52.359
the first day I walked
into the infant ward?

34:53.728 --> 34:55.929
Silence.

34:55.996 --> 34:58.349
These babies should have been
screaming their heads off.

34:58.435 --> 35:00.348
But nobody ever picked
them up when they cried,

35:00.393 --> 35:04.295
so eventually, they just
stopped crying, forever.

35:04.350 --> 35:06.407
Roman suffered something similar

35:06.474 --> 35:08.881
at the South African orphanage.

35:08.935 --> 35:10.277
I believe it's destroyed

35:10.363 --> 35:14.142
his capacity for empathy... for love.

35:14.205 --> 35:16.842
I grew up in the same
place in the same way.

35:16.910 --> 35:19.111
I haven't examined you yet.

35:19.179 --> 35:20.890
(Nas) There is good news.

35:20.945 --> 35:22.281
She was able to get Roman to remember

35:22.348 --> 35:23.816
something other than the cell.

35:23.883 --> 35:26.185
Well, that's good, I mean,
if we keep going that way...

35:26.252 --> 35:28.187
I strongly advise against it.

35:28.254 --> 35:30.289
For every memory that he recovers,

35:30.356 --> 35:32.224
Roman relearns his trauma.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.359
That's a real risk for retriggering

35:34.427 --> 35:35.627
his psychopathic tendencies.

35:35.695 --> 35:37.196
What are you telling us to do?

35:37.263 --> 35:38.697
Isolate him,

35:38.765 --> 35:41.166
in a facility that can
care for him properly.

35:41.234 --> 35:43.736
- Like a mental hospital?
- Yeah.

35:43.803 --> 35:45.471
For how long?

35:45.538 --> 35:47.740
For the rest of his life.

35:55.515 --> 35:57.282
Let's get a drink.

35:57.350 --> 35:59.585
It's my first day back, I'm tired.

35:59.652 --> 36:01.253
Let's get a drink.

36:02.822 --> 36:05.157
All right, just one beer.

36:06.467 --> 36:09.503
Just don't try and make out with me after.

36:17.412 --> 36:19.146
Hey, you're still here?

36:19.214 --> 36:22.616
Ah, just working on the leopard tattoo.

36:22.684 --> 36:24.952
Thought I would take a break.

36:25.019 --> 36:28.088
I heard Dr. Sun was kinda harsh.

36:28.990 --> 36:31.458
She said Roman can't be fixed.

36:32.727 --> 36:34.695
Do you believe her?

36:35.697 --> 36:39.132
She was... very confident.

36:42.437 --> 36:47.237
You know... from a scientific perspective,

36:47.307 --> 36:50.811
psychological conclusions are rarely...

36:50.879 --> 36:54.214
well, conclusive.

36:54.282 --> 36:56.316
He's my brother.

36:58.353 --> 37:03.257
I know that there's a side
to him that she can't see.

37:04.559 --> 37:07.261
But I'm not objective.

37:08.796 --> 37:10.297
Maybe that's the point.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.301
Weller wasn't objective,

37:14.369 --> 37:17.004
and he brought out the best in you.

37:18.306 --> 37:21.208
Maybe you can do that for Roman.

37:27.448 --> 37:29.082
Thanks.

37:32.186 --> 37:33.854
I'm sorry.

37:33.922 --> 37:36.294
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

37:36.372 --> 37:38.125
It just caught me off guard.

37:38.192 --> 37:40.385
Your face coming at me, like...

37:40.457 --> 37:43.029
I was there, we don't need
to do the play by play.

37:43.064 --> 37:44.724
- We really don't.
- (laughing)

37:44.763 --> 37:47.200
You know, you're the only
person who thinks you're funny.

37:47.268 --> 37:48.235
Hmm.

37:48.303 --> 37:51.071
You're not even my type anyway.

37:51.139 --> 37:52.806
Too smart or too classy?

37:52.874 --> 37:55.838
Too classy? Really?

37:56.365 --> 37:59.479
Hey, let me get a double.

37:59.547 --> 38:01.248
Thanks.

38:01.316 --> 38:04.318
Look, Tasha, everything
that's happened recently...

38:04.385 --> 38:09.856
Jones, the Akkadian,
Sandstorm ambush, it...

38:09.924 --> 38:12.064
my... my head's been just...

38:12.126 --> 38:14.261
- Apology accepted.
- All right.

38:14.329 --> 38:15.729
For real.

38:15.797 --> 38:19.399
Now, let's never talk about this again.

38:19.467 --> 38:21.184
- Agreed.
- Okay.

38:21.277 --> 38:24.104
(chuckles)

38:24.172 --> 38:25.772
Mm.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.342
(Tasha) I think someone's checking you out.

38:28.409 --> 38:31.445

38:31.512 --> 38:33.413

"Let's Talk" playing)

38:36.084 --> 38:38.292
Oh, come on, you shutting it down already?

38:38.347 --> 38:41.253
Yeah, guess I'm not used to having
you around, it's like twice the work.

38:41.288 --> 38:43.357
- (scoffs)
- You gonna be okay?

38:44.759 --> 38:47.260
Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm good money.

38:50.331 --> 38:52.833

38:57.138 --> 38:59.006

39:02.443 --> 39:07.414

Uhh-ugh!

39:26.393 --> 39:27.360
Oh, my God.

39:29.170 --> 39:30.804
Of course.

39:36.010 --> 39:37.544
I got something to show you.

39:37.612 --> 39:39.379
What is this?

39:39.447 --> 39:41.214
You'll see.

39:45.357 --> 39:46.182
Ha!

39:46.700 --> 39:47.827
Ta-da!

39:53.424 --> 39:57.169
Good, huh? This has the highest
"Consumer Reports" safety rating.

39:57.204 --> 39:58.617
Extra-firm mattress.

39:58.719 --> 40:00.300
No bumpers.

40:00.518 --> 40:03.019
Uh, this... this... this is too much.

40:03.087 --> 40:05.741
Huh? Well, I don't know.

40:05.819 --> 40:08.325
I like 'em. And this.

40:08.392 --> 40:10.283
We can... we can choose the colors.

40:10.318 --> 40:12.292
All non-toxic, of course.

40:12.370 --> 40:13.996
I like the yellow, but I mean,

40:14.031 --> 40:15.383
do you know how many yellows there are?

40:15.427 --> 40:17.281
I got a job offer in Colorado.

40:19.337 --> 40:22.093
It's a promotion, with... with a raise,

40:22.139 --> 40:25.969
and, um, Conor put in
for a transfer as well.

40:26.616 --> 40:29.269
Look, I know... I know we decided
to do this baby thing together,

40:29.355 --> 40:32.301
so if you don't want me to take it, I'll...

40:32.387 --> 40:34.117
I'll stay here, I'll turn it down.

40:34.185 --> 40:37.487
(chuckles) Well, I mean...

40:37.555 --> 40:40.624
you really wanna move to Colorado?

40:41.993 --> 40:44.034
Well, experience in other offices

40:44.069 --> 40:47.731
would give me a shot at an
executive position someday.

40:47.798 --> 40:49.232
Yeah.

40:50.468 --> 40:53.236
Anyway, you said you wanted
me to take a desk job.

40:55.973 --> 40:59.309
Yeah. Yes, I did.

41:02.013 --> 41:03.380
You should take it.

41:05.716 --> 41:07.417
Thank you.

41:09.086 --> 41:11.388
Look, we'll figure this out together, okay?

41:11.455 --> 41:14.524
(chuckles) Yes, we will.

41:19.630 --> 41:20.730
What's going on?

41:20.798 --> 41:22.165
Patterson solved the leopard tattoo.

41:22.233 --> 41:24.801
- What? How?
- Mancala. It's a game.

41:24.869 --> 41:26.852
You move marbles around in a set pattern...

41:26.938 --> 41:30.240
or migraine pills... which
is what made me realize

41:30.308 --> 41:33.410
Roman has been playing
mancala with the sugar cubes.

41:33.477 --> 41:34.900
He's not aware that he's doing it,

41:34.947 --> 41:36.695
but mancala's very popular in South Africa.

41:36.773 --> 41:38.444
You must have both played
it a lot as children,

41:38.522 --> 41:39.965
and it's stuck in his subconscious.

41:40.043 --> 41:41.070
How does that crack the leopard?

41:41.133 --> 41:43.147
If you flip it, some of its spots

41:43.195 --> 41:45.096
are like the pockets in a board.

41:45.164 --> 41:46.515
Five different boards, in fact.

41:46.593 --> 41:48.761
Mancala can have an
infinite amount of moves.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.160
But the leopard only has
three rings on its tail.

41:51.230 --> 41:53.623
So, I tried moving the specs in each board

41:53.689 --> 41:56.357
in groups of three
until I ran out of moves.

41:56.425 --> 41:59.727
The final pattern across all
five boards came out as...

41:59.795 --> 42:02.363
(Nas) Braille for a social security number.

42:02.431 --> 42:04.356
- Kat Jarrett.
- Part of the inner circle

42:04.426 --> 42:06.334
of a biker gang called the Viper Kings.

42:06.402 --> 42:07.936
We just got her file from the ATF.

42:08.003 --> 42:10.735
Okay, so that's her
making some kind of deal.

42:10.770 --> 42:12.438
Wait. Who is that?

42:15.678 --> 42:17.479
Oh, my God.

42:17.562 --> 42:18.562
It's Roman.
