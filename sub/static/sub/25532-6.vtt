00:06.006 --> 00:08.425
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert,

00:08.842 --> 00:12.095
the length of your hair is irrelevant
to your education.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.556
There's no reason for you to stay home.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.392
Please, Marilla, please don't make me go!
I can't bear the humiliation!

00:17.476 --> 00:18.936
It's just too awful!

00:19.019 --> 00:22.564
Now, now, it won't be nearly
as bad as you think.

00:22.648 --> 00:25.776
They already think I'm a freak!
Whatever will they think now?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.237
You're going to school today
and that's final.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.664
Dearest Snow Queen, how you must miss
your blossoms in the winter.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.041
Now I know just how you feel.

00:44.795 --> 00:48.590
You've barely touched your breakfast.
At least drink your milk.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.471
<i>Surely it can't be that awful?</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:56.306
I'm a monstrosity, Diana.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.183
In fact, you best forget me now
and forever.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.811
I'd never, ever want to bring
this humiliation upon you too.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.818
Best take off your hat.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.290
I made a promise...
never to forsake thee.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.917
Besides...

01:24.584 --> 01:25.961
it's only hair.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.964
It'll grow back soon.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.841
Not nearly soon enough.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.623
Anne.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.459
- You're back.
- Yes.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.169
Hi.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.547
- There's no gold!
- I-I know. I-I heard.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.132
That's not why I'm here.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.760
It's really good to see you.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.560
Open your readers to page 20.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.692
What has she done with her hair?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.194
Look at her!

02:33.987 --> 02:37.574
It appears we have a new boy
in class today.

02:39.368 --> 02:42.162
Are you sure you're sitting
in the right place, young man?

03:28.959 --> 03:31.545
And Josie Pye has a soul
darker than a starless night!

03:31.628 --> 03:34.548
I dare not even repeat to you
the wicked, wicked things she said.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.551
You will if I need to have words
with her mother.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.679
She told Tillie that
I had all my hair cut off due to lice!

03:40.762 --> 03:43.014
She said it's because
I'm of "orphan stock."

03:43.098 --> 03:45.350
Right, then. Words it is.

03:45.434 --> 03:49.020
Oh, Marilla, what is it that makes people
take such delight in the misery of others?

03:49.104 --> 03:51.022
You should've heard
how everybody laughed

03:51.106 --> 03:52.983
after Mr. Phillips called me
"the new boy."

03:53.442 --> 03:56.528
Oh, and to make matters worse,
Gilbert was there.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.572
At least he didn't laugh at me,
but still...

03:58.655 --> 03:59.865
Gilbert Blythe?

04:00.323 --> 04:03.076
- I didn't realize he was back.
- Neither did I.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.371
Of all days to return,
of course he had to pick today.

04:06.455 --> 04:08.749
And how is he?
Is he well?

04:09.458 --> 04:11.251
He seemed well enough.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.462
I can't imagine it's easy,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.339
all alone at this time of the year.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.500
Ah.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.838
- I warned you about the winters here.
- Nah.

04:56.922 --> 05:00.300
Not like this, Blythe. Not like this.
This sun isn't even real.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.928
It don't give you no heat,
no... warmth, no nothing.

05:03.011 --> 05:06.807
It just shine on you
like some faraway lantern in the sky. Oh!

05:06.890 --> 05:09.267
And the air!
How can I do any work

05:09.351 --> 05:11.269
if the very air I breathe
is out to kill me?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.398
Let's get you situated.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.195
Dad would be happy
that it's being appreciated.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.907
And you're pathetic.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.831
Thank you, Mr. Blythe.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.594
Most of those scraps aren't even fit
for patching britches.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.054
What in heaven's name
are you planning to do with them?

06:28.138 --> 06:29.055
Art.

06:29.598 --> 06:30.640
Art?

06:30.724 --> 06:34.311
Cole is painting us a magnificent forest
for the Christmas Pantomime.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.480
And all this fabric will lend it
a most scrumptious texture.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.232
Hmm.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.405
Mother gave me dresses to try!

06:45.905 --> 06:48.241
You'll never guess
what else Mother let me borrow!

06:48.325 --> 06:49.951
- Um...
- You'll never, ever guess!

06:50.035 --> 06:52.913
- Could I guess?
- Neither of you will ever guess!

06:54.247 --> 06:56.833
Hurry, Diana!
I can't wait to see it!

06:58.043 --> 06:59.628
Alright.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.967
A tiara?

07:06.051 --> 07:09.262
Oh, Diana,
you look like a real fairy queen! See?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.858
- Would you like to try it on?
- No.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.444
No, Diana. Not...

07:24.569 --> 07:26.279
Not like this.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.449
I couldn't possibly...

07:31.201 --> 07:32.661
I'll try it on.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.414
Oh, goodness.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.716
You're both crazy!

08:28.717 --> 08:32.345
Well done. That's enough for now.
Now off you go.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.515
"See that apple dangling from the tree?

08:37.142 --> 08:41.020
Uh... pray, dear lad,
go and fetch it for me."

08:43.523 --> 08:44.607
Isn't that your cue?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.485
I can barely hear him.

08:49.612 --> 08:53.074
"Pray, dear lad, go fetch it for me!!"

08:53.158 --> 08:54.451
Is that loud enough for you?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.454
Alright, on the count of three,
we're all going to sway to the left.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.748
Ready? One, two, three!

09:00.415 --> 09:02.876
- "Get back..."
- Uh, other left, Charlie.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.712
"...to the murk waters
from whence thy came!

09:05.837 --> 09:09.215
I banish thee to..." Line!

09:11.760 --> 09:15.055
- Um... I banish thee to darkness...
- Don't tell me!

09:16.389 --> 09:19.476
Start over! I can't hear myself think!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.311
You're it!

09:21.394 --> 09:24.564
Alright, let's try that again.
One, two, three.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.920
- Has anyone seen Matthew?
- He ran out crying like a baby.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.671
I see.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.008
Let's begin. Eyes up! And...

09:56.805 --> 09:59.349
Anne! There she is! Hi, Anne!

10:01.476 --> 10:05.188
Hello, my fairy princess!

10:06.231 --> 10:09.025
- Seeing a tree is so exciting.
- See you at the rehearsal!

10:09.818 --> 10:11.236
See you later, Anne!

10:12.821 --> 10:15.532
Why, uh...?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.118
Uh, they've decided
it brings good luck.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.162
Childhood is not without its challenges.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.540
These are the spare clothes
we're putting together

10:23.623 --> 10:25.166
for Marilla's costume work.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.044
She's supposed to sew
all manner of wondrous things!

10:34.968 --> 10:37.554
I've spent so many hours
admiring the trees of Avonlea,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.472
but to actually be one...

10:39.848 --> 10:42.642
It provides so much scope
for the imagination.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.646
They'll not let you, uh, play a girl?

10:46.729 --> 10:50.191
Oh, it's not because of my hair.
Or lack thereof.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.361
Mrs. Lynde says that the tree
is a pivotal role.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.991
When you were younger, what part
did you play in the Christmas Panto?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.201
Oh, no, I didn't play a part.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.829
- Did you sing carols?
- Oh, no. Now in you get.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.835
Matthew?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.880
Did you have a happy childhood?

11:13.256 --> 11:14.632
It was, uh...

11:16.134 --> 11:17.886
It was a long time ago. Step up!

12:37.340 --> 12:39.759
Well, well, well, look who I found.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.889
Of all the little brothers
in the whole world,

12:44.973 --> 12:47.558
you must be the best at hiding.
Hey.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.228
I brought you something.
Ready?

12:53.064 --> 12:54.857
The plan is:

12:54.941 --> 12:57.944
take these to school
and you make some friends.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.489
You can do it, Matteroo.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.159
You show up with these,
you'll be Mr. Popular.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.996
Easy-peasy. Wanna play?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.747
Bet you're a natural.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.376
Thank you, Michael.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.266
Anne?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.226
Yes, Marilla?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.979
I'll want you to fetch these ingredients
today in Carmody.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.982
And be sure to get brown sugar,
not white.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.484
- Send Jerry!
- I beg your pardon?

13:39.235 --> 13:40.486
Please send Jerry?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.822
I am sending Jerry,
thank you very much.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.533
But he has his own errands to run.
You'll go along with him.

13:45.616 --> 13:46.909
Please don't make me go, Marilla.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.120
It's awful enough being
the laughing stock of Avonlea,

13:49.203 --> 13:51.164
but now Carmody?!
I'll never live it down.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.291
If you want mince pies
or currants in your pudding,

13:53.374 --> 13:55.334
you'll just have to live it down,
won't you?

13:55.418 --> 13:56.919
I'll be happy to starve!

13:57.003 --> 13:59.005
Enough of your cheek,
Anne Shirley-Cuthbert.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.214
Off you go.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.571
That's a... that's a good spot.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.782
I spent a lot of time up here...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.159
when I was young.

14:28.242 --> 14:32.455
A whole other town is gonna laugh at me
and call me "boy." I can't bear it.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.459
You've overcome worse than this... Anne.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.669
I'm sure you can again.

14:38.753 --> 14:42.507
I wish I could stay up here forever
and never show my face again.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.592
I used to wish that, too.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.055
But it's not in your nature...

14:50.681 --> 14:52.058
like it is in mine.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.854
You're too brave to hide away.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.193
- You think I'm brave?
- I admire you for it.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.154
You just... you jump right in, both feet.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.620
Thank you, Matthew.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.082
That's exactly what I'm gonna do!

15:16.374 --> 15:17.750
Ah!

15:25.716 --> 15:29.262
I'd like us to agree that any conversation
about my hair is off-limits.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.888
I already saw your haircut.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.516
And I'm saying
I don't wish to discuss it.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.893
You're the one talking about it, not me.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.312
Fine. So then drop it.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.523
I never picked it up.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.538
I cannot believe
I'm missing rehearsals for this!

16:08.342 --> 16:09.927
Good day to you, ma'am.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.889
Oh... Hello.

16:14.849 --> 16:15.933
I...

16:16.934 --> 16:18.352
Are you...?

16:18.769 --> 16:21.189
My name is Sebastian.
I'm Gilbert Blythe's friend.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.732
His friend?

16:22.815 --> 16:26.444
Yes. I live here now. We met
when we was both working on the ship,

16:26.527 --> 16:28.279
on our way to Trinidad.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.364
Oh. I see.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.783
Is Gilbert at home?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.577
Of course, yes.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.370
Blythe!

16:36.954 --> 16:39.665
There's a very surprised lady
here to see you.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.963
Miss Cuthbert!
What a pleasant surprise.

16:46.047 --> 16:48.382
Hello, Gilbert. Welcome home.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.011
Thank you.
I see you've already met Sebastian.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.516
- Won't you come in?
- Oh, thank you, I-I just came by to see

16:56.599 --> 16:59.602
if you'd like to join us
for Christmas dinner at Green Gables.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.606
That's...
that's very kind of you to offer.

17:08.861 --> 17:12.740
And of course you're welcome
to join us... Sebastian.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.409
- I'd be delighted.
- Oh.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.079
Very well, then.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.204
Good day.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.430
Stop staring.
Since everyone already thinks I'm a boy,

17:36.514 --> 17:39.225
I thought it best
to actually be one today.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.938
Oy, lad!

17:44.647 --> 17:45.648
Fancy a copper?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.276
Unload the rest of this here for me,
would ya?

17:57.159 --> 17:59.328
That's good, lad, that's good.
Here ya go.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.547
- Move it, boy.
- Sorry... sir.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.965
Knuckle down.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.049
Oh!

18:12.883 --> 18:14.010
Yes! I get your marble!

18:17.263 --> 18:18.306
Oh!

18:18.389 --> 18:20.516
Yeah! Yeah!

18:21.475 --> 18:22.977
Yes!

18:23.060 --> 18:24.270
Nice shot!

18:34.238 --> 18:35.531
Where's my driver?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.452
Excuse me.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.746
Boy, can you help, please?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.915
Just take that end, please. Thank you.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.512
Anne?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.184
Hello, Miss Jeannie.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.644
Good heavens.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.520
Why on earth
are you dressed like a boy?

19:07.188 --> 19:10.024
I, uh... I had to cut off my hair.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.442
Why? What happened?

19:11.525 --> 19:14.528
It's a long and lamentable tale,
but suffice it to say,

19:14.612 --> 19:17.823
it's been an interesting experiment
seeing the other side of the coin.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.700
Being a boy is quite liberating.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.327
Women wear trousers in Paris.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.454
- Really?
<i>- Of course!</i>

19:24.747 --> 19:27.541
That's where I'm headed now.
A little change of pace.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.502
- Huh.
- Thank you for the inspiration.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.337
I may try a pair.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.549
And thank you
for comparing me to a calla lily.

19:37.176 --> 19:41.222
I'm sorry I did,
but the compliment was true enough.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.142
Have a wonderful time in Paris, ma'am.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.359
Goodbye, dear dress.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.196
I think it's still meant to be yours.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.991
Maybe someday.
When I have more than a penny.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.670
You bought a dress?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.005
I thought you wanted to be a boy.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.800
Only for the afternoon.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.307
Let's see
menacing devil lobster!

20:26.517 --> 20:28.519
What on earth is that?

20:28.936 --> 20:32.148
Thomas Lynde, you look as though
you're about to tickle someone.

20:32.606 --> 20:33.858
You said menacing.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.192
Exactly.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.944
So go on, then.

20:37.528 --> 20:38.738
Menace.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.656
Alright, alright. Ahem.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.910
Is this evil enough for you, Mrs. Lynde?
Hmm?

20:44.994 --> 20:48.205
Hmm? What do you think? Hmm?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.960
You're so talented, Cole.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.171
I love that bird so much.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.757
No one in the whole class
can paint like you, Cole.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.052
Come along, ladies,
there's no need to watch paint dry.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.054
Come along, girls.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.474
Want to see something funny?

21:07.224 --> 21:09.643
Cluster around, girls.
Cluster.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.063
Let's begin. Take your positions.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.449
Start again.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.578
- Oh! Oh!
- Oops!

21:27.661 --> 21:28.829
Ah...

21:43.177 --> 21:44.553
- Cole, are you alright?
- Cole!

21:44.637 --> 21:45.971
- Ow!
- Oh, my...

21:46.055 --> 21:47.348
Oh, goodness me!

21:47.431 --> 21:50.142
- Stay still. Don't move.
- Is he alright?!

21:50.226 --> 21:52.019
- Cole!
- His wrist is definitely broken.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.438
- I don't know what else.
- It was an accident!

21:54.522 --> 21:57.233
- Poor Cole.
- I swear!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.192
Oh, for heaven's sake.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.985
- Oh, my goodness.
- Cole!

22:05.699 --> 22:07.993
Jerry, everything alright?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.204
It's Christmas Eve.
You're not working today.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.122
I'm not working. Here.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.051
Thank you.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.886
It's wonderful.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.748
What are you all doing here?

22:54.832 --> 22:58.419
We went to your house to check on you,
but your folks said that you came here.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.340
Can we help you? If you tell us
what to do, maybe we can do it together.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.176
- I've always wanted to be a painter!
- Moody!

23:07.261 --> 23:10.431
Let me talk you all through it first.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.569
Trinidad!

23:23.777 --> 23:25.863
Oh, Marilla, I'm so excited
to meet Sebastian!

23:26.280 --> 23:27.823
Try not to make a fuss.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.867
He's...

23:31.201 --> 23:34.204
Well, he's... he's an islander.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.873
Same as you and me.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.001
Do you reckon they like mince pies
in Trinidad? I sure hope so.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.420
Either way,
I'm sure he'll be polite about it.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.590
He seems like a very nice fellow indeed.

23:45.382 --> 23:48.010
No, you don't.
Straight to the parlor, please.

23:51.013 --> 23:54.975
And mind you, pass a broom afterwards.
I won't have these pine needles underfoot.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.518
We've got company coming.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.923
Merry Christmas to you both!

24:26.757 --> 24:28.842
- And to you.
- Do come in.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.520
Matthew, this is Sebastian.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.482
Pleased to meet you... Sebastian.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.275
Please, call me Bash.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.071
Oh, what a lovely home.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.533
Nice and warm.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.035
Let me take your coats.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.662
Oh. Uh...

24:58.288 --> 24:59.456
Thank you.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.461
I almost forgot.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.677
My, how very kind of you.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.680
It's curry.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.265
Curry?

25:16.348 --> 25:19.143
- Yes, it's a blend of fantastic spices.
- Oh.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.728
Why, thank you.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.397
- It's good for stews.
- How nice.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.357
We eat a lot of stew here.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.943
Oh. Won't you sit down?

25:28.026 --> 25:29.111
Thank you.

25:42.583 --> 25:46.754
- Uh, I wonder what's become of Anne.
- Hmm.

25:46.837 --> 25:50.299
I'm looking forward to meeting Anne.
I've heard so much about her.

26:00.934 --> 26:04.354
You're Sebastian. Oh, how thrilling.
I've read so much

26:04.438 --> 26:07.107
about the ancient kingdoms of Africa
and the Moors of Spain,

26:07.191 --> 26:10.110
but I've never actually met
a colored person before.

26:10.861 --> 26:13.030
Or not one of your complexion.

26:13.113 --> 26:16.241
Your skin is absolutely extraordinary.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.161
It-it's a rare pleasure to meet you.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.337
A pleasure to meet you too,
Anne of Green Gables.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.632
Who'd care for some supper?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.968
- Oh, everything smells so good.
- Ever tried mince pie?

26:35.385 --> 26:37.513
No, but my nose tells me I'll like it.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.349
Anne, please blow out
the candles on the tree.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.066
Anne.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.568
Merry Christmas.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.865
But, uh, I don't have anything for you.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.242
That's alright.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.724
Sea legs? I've heard tell
from fishermen around these parts,

27:22.808 --> 27:24.810
but I didn't know it was true.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.770
Oh, it's true,

27:26.854 --> 27:29.356
as Bash here has delighted
in pointing out to me.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.941
He was a sight to behold.

27:31.024 --> 27:34.778
Have you been to many exotic
ports of call? Please, do tell us.

27:34.862 --> 27:36.488
New York, Boston,

27:36.572 --> 27:39.283
Maine, Jamaica, Canary Islands...

27:39.366 --> 27:41.743
- Do you have a favorite?
- My island, of course.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.161
I can understand that.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.623
In fact, the Christmas Panto
is about our magical island.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.959
- Panto?
- Pantomime.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.752
The play I've been helping with.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.754
It's going to be wonderful.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.549
And the costumes are fantastical,
thanks to Marilla.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.802
- Oh, hush now.
- Sounds like Carnival.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.554
Why you didn't tell me more about this?

28:00.637 --> 28:03.056
Because you said you wanted
to stay in the house until spring!

28:04.766 --> 28:05.893
But...

28:05.976 --> 28:09.229
now that you mention it, I could
really use your help with the rigging.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.647
What do you say?

28:11.273 --> 28:12.482
Why not?

28:12.733 --> 28:15.110
I'd like to know more
about this magical island.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.907
- To the island.
- To the island.

28:20.657 --> 28:21.992
Merry Christmas.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.535
Merry Christmas.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.107
Heavenly Father,

28:54.191 --> 28:56.652
please don't let me forget
these damnable lines!

28:58.570 --> 29:00.656
Oh! Lord, forgive me.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.034
- Excuse me, madam.
- Has anyone seen Josie Pye? Josie Pye?!

29:04.368 --> 29:07.204
Where on earth is she?
We're minutes away!

29:07.913 --> 29:11.083
Oh! I see you've hired a hand.
Good thinking.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.461
Oh, no, this is my friend Sebastian.
He offered to help with the play.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.380
Well. Well, well, well.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.048
There you are!

29:18.924 --> 29:21.551
You look like you've just been widowed.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.637
Where's your shovel?

29:23.720 --> 29:25.514
Where's your pivotal prop?!

29:26.556 --> 29:28.308
I left it at home.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.562
Oh, my word, you've lost your voice!

29:33.146 --> 29:35.524
Oh, my, my, my, my.
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

29:35.607 --> 29:37.943
Think, think, think, think, think...

29:39.486 --> 29:40.570
Anne!

29:40.654 --> 29:42.197
Get over here. Quickly!

29:43.573 --> 29:46.868
You're gonna take over from Josie.
You're going to play The Boy.

29:46.952 --> 29:50.038
- Somebody get me a script!
- It would be an honor to play the part!

29:50.122 --> 29:53.083
- I already know the lines.
- Word perfect. Study, child, study!

29:53.166 --> 29:54.835
And you. Tree.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.129
The tree's a lovely part, Josie.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.589
I'll teach you all moves for the dance
that we have, then...

29:59.673 --> 30:04.511
Shovel! Where am I gonna get you a shovel?
The play falls apart without a shovel!

30:09.182 --> 30:10.809
You can make friends, Matteroo.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.811
<i>I'll never be brave.</i>

30:16.606 --> 30:18.942
<i>Of all the little brothers
in the whole world,</i>

30:19.026 --> 30:20.569
you must be the best at hiding.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.238
You can do it, Matteroo.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.699
- I-I...
- It'll only take an hour, Matthew.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.618
You'll be home before you know it.
Oh, seats.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.413
Excuse me.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.458
Sorry, excuse me, sorry, pardon me.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.919
- Heavens, what's the matter, Anne?
- I need a shovel. Please?

30:38.003 --> 30:40.630
It's a matter most urgent.
Josie Pye just fell gravely ill.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.799
What do you intend to do with it,
bury her?

30:42.883 --> 30:45.469
I'm The Boy now!
I've been given her role!

30:45.552 --> 30:48.180
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- You don't understand!

30:48.263 --> 30:49.639
I need a shovel! Josie forgot!

30:49.723 --> 30:52.059
If I don't have a shovel for the end,
it won't make sense,

30:52.142 --> 30:54.853
- it'll ruin the whole thing!
- I'll run out, I'll find one.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.022
You go on now. Don't you worry.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.899
Probably for the best.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.443
Ah! I'm sorry, excuse me.

31:24.257 --> 31:25.675
Ladies and gentlemen.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.178
Welcome, one and all,

31:28.261 --> 31:31.056
to The Tale of The Magical Island.

31:31.848 --> 31:32.974
Hoot!

31:33.058 --> 31:34.726
Hoot, hoot!

31:55.205 --> 31:56.790
- They harvest!
- We harvest!

31:56.873 --> 31:58.208
- They sow!
- We sow!

31:58.291 --> 31:59.626
- They garden!
- We garden!

31:59.709 --> 32:01.211
- They grow!
- We grow!

32:11.304 --> 32:14.474
- Our island is splendid!
- And much recommended.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.265
Hoot!

32:55.348 --> 32:57.225
Well done!

33:04.858 --> 33:06.985
Hello?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.987
Hello?

33:20.582 --> 33:22.417
Because you have been
hardworking and good,

33:22.501 --> 33:25.712
I bestow upon thee
this golden apple tree.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.097
<i>Now rise, dear boy!</i>

33:37.307 --> 33:39.976
I promise thee faithfully
to always protect this tree,

33:40.060 --> 33:42.562
for the sake of our beloved island.

33:42.646 --> 33:45.774
Aw...

33:47.400 --> 33:49.819
Why are you stealing my shovel?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.616
That's the minister!

34:01.331 --> 34:03.208
Oh!

34:04.042 --> 34:05.585
Boy?!

34:05.669 --> 34:09.214
See that golden apple
dangling from the tree.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.757
Pray, dear lad,

34:10.840 --> 34:13.552
do pass it to me.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.429
Fair dame,
the apple is not ours to take!

34:16.513 --> 34:19.181
Remove thee the fruit,
and great trouble we'll make!

34:19.266 --> 34:21.141
Oh, come now!

34:21.226 --> 34:25.647
Just one... teeny... apple?

34:28.358 --> 34:29.985
Christmas Panto, you say?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.652
My girl is The Boy.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.699
My... I'd like to see that.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.871
Look out! Look out behind you!

34:47.627 --> 34:49.212
Best of luck to her.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.412
Devil lobster!

35:22.495 --> 35:24.497
Devil lobster!

35:24.581 --> 35:26.708
What creature is this?!

35:26.791 --> 35:28.627
Who is this monster?!

35:28.710 --> 35:30.670
Devil lobster!

35:30.754 --> 35:32.297
Devil lobster!

35:53.610 --> 35:55.654
Devil lobster!

35:55.737 --> 35:57.447
Devil lobster!

35:57.530 --> 36:02.035
What creature is this?
Who is this monster?

36:02.118 --> 36:04.037
Devil lobster!

36:04.120 --> 36:06.289
Devil lobster!

36:06.373 --> 36:09.793
I'm simply shimmering with sin!

36:13.380 --> 36:17.550
Dearest fairy queen,
we beg for your aid and forgiveness.

36:17.634 --> 36:21.012
Please send us a hero
to vanquish our foe!

36:24.099 --> 36:26.101
Aw...

36:27.143 --> 36:29.229
Your wish is my command!

36:55.380 --> 36:59.008
Get back to the waters
from whence thy came!

36:59.092 --> 37:01.928
I shall banish thee to darkness

37:02.011 --> 37:04.556
in thy fairy queen's name.

37:04.639 --> 37:07.642
You think you can turn our land
into rot?

37:07.726 --> 37:10.186
I'm the unconquerable prince,

37:10.270 --> 37:11.980
lest you forgot!

37:13.648 --> 37:15.150
Unconquerable?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.110
Ha!

37:21.573 --> 37:22.824
Argh!

37:36.045 --> 37:37.464
Ah!

37:41.718 --> 37:44.137
- That was so much fun!
- Come on, come on, come on!

37:44.220 --> 37:45.972
Hurry!

37:46.055 --> 37:47.432
- What...
- Sorry.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.436
Hey! That's enough!

37:51.895 --> 37:53.605
Quiet down!

37:57.609 --> 37:59.694
Oh!

38:08.244 --> 38:09.454
Hold this.

38:15.919 --> 38:18.505
- Oh, my! Is he alright?
- I can't believe that happened!

38:18.588 --> 38:21.466
- Did you see what happened?
- Out of my way! Out of my way!

38:22.258 --> 38:24.969
- We're gonna lose the audience.
- I'm here, I'm here.

38:27.263 --> 38:30.183
Get him out of this wretched thing!
Is this your doing?

38:31.476 --> 38:34.896
- You savage brute! Shame on you!
- Who will play the owl now?

38:35.522 --> 38:37.398
- Come along.
- He needs air.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.192
Clear back! Clear back!

38:39.275 --> 38:42.821
Do you mind if I take
the costume? The show must go on!

38:50.787 --> 38:53.706
- I'll take that.
- Yeah, go... go get 'em.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.001
- Excuse me.
- Hello, young lady.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.215
- Oh, dear!
- Places everyone!

39:02.298 --> 39:05.051
Oh, Matthew, you're my hero.
Thank you. I'll tell Mrs. Lynde.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.970
Bash, set the black hole!

39:25.488 --> 39:27.991
No, no, no. Goodness, goodness!

39:29.993 --> 39:30.952
Behind ya!

39:31.035 --> 39:32.704
Ah!

39:33.454 --> 39:35.957
Ah!

39:41.129 --> 39:42.964
Well done!

39:43.965 --> 39:46.467
Without Billy,
how are we gonna finish the play?!

39:46.551 --> 39:49.554
- That was the best...
- Oh! Oh, salvation!

39:53.349 --> 39:55.476
- Put this on!
- No, that's enough of that.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.603
What's going on?

39:56.686 --> 39:59.063
- Would you just stay still?
- I won't have part of this.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.899
- We need an epilogue!
- Rachel!

40:00.982 --> 40:03.234
Anne rose to the occasion,
now it's your turn.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.403
Mr. Cuthbert's going to play
the owl?

40:10.366 --> 40:13.912
The owl has to finish the play!
All you have to do is read! Go!

40:15.580 --> 40:17.290
Oh!

40:41.230 --> 40:42.649
It's alright, Matteroo.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.400
<i>You don't have to participate.</i>

40:45.318 --> 40:46.527
It's alright.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.155
<i>Let's get you home, okay?</i>

40:55.244 --> 40:57.830
<i>Anne rose to the occasion.
Now it's your turn.</i>

40:59.499 --> 41:03.419
And they all lived happily ever after!

41:05.838 --> 41:08.424
Well done, Matthew!

41:50.466 --> 41:55.179
Today, in the wake
of my very own Diamond Jubilee,

41:55.263 --> 41:59.058
I hereby bless all of Avonlea!

41:59.142 --> 42:00.685
God bless you all.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.479
And God save me!

42:18.745 --> 42:21.080
When the devil lobster
and prince waged their battle,

42:21.164 --> 42:23.624
it took every ounce of my strength
not to laugh out loud!

42:23.708 --> 42:26.169
And didn't the minister
make a most remarkable Dame?!

42:26.252 --> 42:29.130
I don't think I'll ever feel
quite the same about his sermons.

42:29.213 --> 42:31.049
It was a thrilling evening!

42:31.132 --> 42:33.843
I doubt I'll sleep a wink tonight
or maybe ever again?

42:33.926 --> 42:36.721
I was very proud of you,

42:36.804 --> 42:39.140
stepping into the role the way you did.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.350
I hope I made a convincing Boy.
And just think,

42:41.434 --> 42:44.353
if you hadn't sent me to Carmody,
I might not have had the practice.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.773
Whatever do you mean?

42:47.690 --> 42:49.942
Matthew! You were
a most magnificent snowy owl!

42:50.026 --> 42:53.279
- Didn't you think so, Marilla?
- I'd say about stole the show.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.864
He did.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.366
I never thought
you'd ever do anything like that.

42:57.450 --> 42:58.785
Ah, uh...

42:58.868 --> 43:00.495
neither did I.

43:03.539 --> 43:07.877
These were mine when I was a boy
and I thought you might like them.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.088
- Marbles?!
- Yeah.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.634
I challenge thee to a duel!
Doth thou accept?

43:15.384 --> 43:16.969
I doth.

43:17.553 --> 43:20.098
And don't be upset if I win.
I've had some practice.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.600
So have I.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.560
So have I.

43:24.644 --> 43:27.188
We'll see about that.

43:27.647 --> 43:29.565
- That's the nines.
- I know.

43:31.776 --> 43:33.486
- What goes in the middle?
- Green.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.822
Green? Winner gets the hat?

43:35.905 --> 43:37.865
Winner gets the hat.
