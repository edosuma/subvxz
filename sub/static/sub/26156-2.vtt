WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:01.999
- Joseph Beckett.
- You're a traitor, McCoy!

00:02.000 --> 00:03.479
- He's a pro.
- Who missed his mark.

00:04.740 --> 00:06.139
Because I pushed her out the way.

00:06.140 --> 00:10.037
Setting off a sequence of events
that I would give anything to erase.

00:10.038 --> 00:12.579
Press are asking me to confirm that
a female officer was killed.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.069
Faye Caddy...

00:15.070 --> 00:18.149
...and her lovely brother Dennis
Caddy... run a chapter of Albion.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.869
How long has Joseph Beckett been a
member of Albion?

00:20.870 --> 00:22.669
This guy. Lionel Dirkin.

00:22.670 --> 00:25.909
He founded Pellinore. The same private
security company that employed Beckett...

00:25.910 --> 00:27.729
- I'm no killer.
- Oh, we don't think you're the killer,

00:27.730 --> 00:30.149
Dennis. We think you're getaway driver.

00:30.150 --> 00:33.749
Dennis Caddy is to be released
without charge.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.989
We planted a UC in Albion.
You're off the case.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.106
- Who was the agent?
- Got it.

00:37.107 --> 00:39.733
Any further investigation
into Caddy or Albion

00:39.758 --> 00:42.294
will be regarded as perverting
the course of justice.

00:42.319 --> 00:44.310
Your boyfriend watched his
mate fire two bullets

00:44.335 --> 00:46.038
into an unarmed officer...

00:46.070 --> 00:47.450
Could've saved her.

00:49.470 --> 00:51.856
PHONE RINGS

00:51.857 --> 00:55.201
Right. Cab's here in five.
Jonah, you ready?

00:55.202 --> 00:57.542
- Yeah.
- Well, come on.

00:58.990 --> 01:01.090
Incoming.

01:05.670 --> 01:08.629
I hope it goes without saying that
you've all been signed off

01:08.630 --> 01:11.669
for the whole day, nobody
expects you to...

01:11.670 --> 01:13.435
We're right back out the door, Ma'am,

01:13.436 --> 01:17.549
just wanted to tie up a few loose
ends to allow for hangovers.

01:17.550 --> 01:18.909
Understood...

01:18.910 --> 01:22.029
Jonah? I was sorry to not see
you at the funeral?

01:22.030 --> 01:23.509
Or the wake?

01:23.510 --> 01:24.796
Yeah.

01:25.670 --> 01:27.349
We drew straws, Ma'am.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.749
We're looking after Joy's kittens,
one of 'em's epileptic but we're

01:30.750 --> 01:33.829
not sure which one, so we're just
keeping a constant watch on 'em all.

01:34.238 --> 01:35.707
Right...

01:36.690 --> 01:40.690
And where's Stuart got to? Because I
definitely saw him at the funeral.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.892
Kitten watch?

01:46.010 --> 01:50.010
Ma'am, you're going to work this
out, so it may as well come from me.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.610 --> 02:01.506
Call your lawyers, folks.

02:02.810 --> 02:05.649
Hey? Kittens?

02:05.650 --> 02:08.529
I've placed Stuart and Jonah on
surveillance of Dennis Caddy.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.567
They drew straws for who missed the
funeral

02:10.568 --> 02:12.474
and who missed tonight's piss-up.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.529
Well...

02:16.530 --> 02:18.249
...my condolences.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.529
Today isn't just Joy's funeral, it's
this entire bloody department's.

02:21.530 --> 02:24.209
Caddy is embargoed.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.569
Which part of Pembroke's threat of
prison did you feel had wriggle room?

02:27.570 --> 02:30.289
Caddy knows that we had him down as
Beckett's getaway driver.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.689
Now, if we don't at least follow him,

02:32.690 --> 02:34.862
do you not think he's going to be a
little bit suspicious?

02:34.863 --> 02:38.289
If we do less than nothing he's
going to smell a rat.

02:38.290 --> 02:41.618
We are not endangering Pembroke's
agent by following Caddy,

02:41.619 --> 02:43.177
we're protecting her.

02:43.730 --> 02:47.073
Caddy lied about not knowing Beckett.

02:48.410 --> 02:52.249
They were stationed at Basra
together, they're brothers in arms.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.049
He's not some getaway lackey.

02:54.050 --> 02:56.637
So if you don't call Pembroke and
tell him that this is

02:56.638 --> 02:58.925
top-notch thinking, Ma'am, then...

03:00.450 --> 03:02.730
I actually buy that.

03:03.690 --> 03:05.289
Very good.

03:06.209 --> 03:11.169
It was DC Kowalska's brain wave,
I just rode it in.

03:13.650 --> 03:17.650
And erm, you're going to be ever so
proud of me, Ma'am, I've gone

03:18.401 --> 03:21.729
and appointed DC Kowalska as sergeant...

03:21.730 --> 03:23.466
She accepted this morning.

03:24.490 --> 03:28.825
Bitter-sweet for her, of course, but
when was real change anything but?

03:28.850 --> 03:32.842
You've chosen Dinah?
She's already accepted?

03:32.843 --> 03:36.385
You can't go doling out promotions, Viv.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.609
I think you'll find there's a
whole protocol...

03:38.610 --> 03:40.329
I've made her in my own image, Ma'am.

03:40.330 --> 03:41.809
Yeah.

03:41.810 --> 03:43.604
That's what I'm afraid of.

03:52.130 --> 03:55.329
Party or prison?

03:55.330 --> 03:57.529
She couldn't be happier.

03:57.530 --> 04:01.872
And, Dinah, DCI Marchant and I are
in complete agreement...

04:02.083 --> 04:06.082
You are to be promoted to sergeant,
effective immediately.

04:06.574 --> 04:08.765
What? Me?!

04:09.410 --> 04:10.895
That's right.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.009
Down a couple before you say yes.

04:15.010 --> 04:16.849
Now, who has got Joy's iPod?

04:17.982 --> 04:19.879
Let's go.

04:23.050 --> 04:27.050
♪ Just call me angel of the morning

04:27.970 --> 04:31.970
♪ Just touch my cheek before you leave

04:33.290 --> 04:36.129
♪ Baby

04:36.130 --> 04:40.130
♪ Just call me angel of the morning

04:42.370 --> 04:46.370
♪ Then slowly turn away

04:47.690 --> 04:50.849
♪ From me... ♪

04:50.850 --> 04:52.689
Give us your falsetto.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.630
♪ La-la-la-la-la... ♪

04:58.730 --> 05:04.272
So... how long do you think I've got
before I screw this up?

05:04.963 --> 05:06.658
Seriously?

05:09.290 --> 05:10.914
The whole team's behind you,

05:12.499 --> 05:14.073
minimum bet's a month.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.302
I always wanted it, you know?

05:32.267 --> 05:34.108
But not like this.

05:37.890 --> 05:39.209
Never like this.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.914
Hey. Hey...

05:44.571 --> 05:46.555
Joy would've wanted you to have it.

06:01.850 --> 06:05.089
- Oh, God, no, no. I'm sorry.
- Dinah, I'm sorry.

06:05.090 --> 06:09.687
- It just...
- No, it's... it's fine.

06:12.170 --> 06:14.169
I'm just, I'm just gonna go...

06:14.170 --> 06:15.444
...it's fine.

06:52.610 --> 06:53.802
Get in.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.009
Dinah...

06:58.010 --> 07:00.249
...I'm pretty sure you're not
s'posed to be here.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.809
"Pretty sure you're not s'posed
to be here, Sarge."

07:03.410 --> 07:05.370
All right, I won't log it,

07:05.395 --> 07:07.434
but you'll have to shift
before the next rotation...

07:07.570 --> 07:10.518
...Sarge... And congrats.

07:12.570 --> 07:14.929
So. What'd I miss?

07:14.930 --> 07:17.529
Caddy knows we're watching
him, so not much.

07:17.530 --> 07:18.689
Same routine.

07:18.690 --> 07:20.729
Caddy's missus teaching Albion
self-defence.

07:20.730 --> 07:22.529
Self-defence from what?

07:22.530 --> 07:26.091
Dunno. Facts? Pissed-off immigrants?

07:26.092 --> 07:32.074
You? They can't keep their
hands off each other.

07:47.490 --> 07:50.134
DOOR SHUTS

08:06.810 --> 08:10.810
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! Oh, hiya!
We need to talk,

08:10.890 --> 08:12.329
Security, over here!

08:12.330 --> 08:14.769
This person's harassing me,
and she's about to get the shit

08:14.770 --> 08:16.889
kicked out of her by my boyfriend,
who's coming any sec...

08:16.890 --> 08:19.449
I'm an off-duty detective sergeant,
I saw her lifting nail varnish,

08:19.450 --> 08:21.929
- She's drunk, I can smell her breath.
- Empty your pockets.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.449
Empty your pockets, please, Miss.

08:23.450 --> 08:27.213
Don't you dare, get back to the
magazine section, where you belong.

08:27.214 --> 08:29.580
Empty your pockets, please.

08:31.730 --> 08:33.969
- Ta-da.
- Dennis, she put it there.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.808
Yeah, look, check the CCTV, mate,

08:35.809 --> 08:37.889
you'll see the racist bitch
planting that.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.477
You got a storeroom where I can book her?

08:39.477 --> 08:41.769
Save everybody the embarrassment, y'know?

08:41.770 --> 08:44.227
- Yeah.
- C'mon, let's go.

08:47.210 --> 08:49.209
Stay the fuck away from us.

08:49.210 --> 08:51.181
And you should know better, mate.

08:58.690 --> 09:02.690
SIREN WAILS

09:06.290 --> 09:09.809
You're in early? Everyone else is
phoning in with hangovers.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.889
- Is Dinah in?
- No.

09:11.890 --> 09:14.089
And first day as sergeant, too.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.351
Phone call for you, line two.

09:18.050 --> 09:21.129
- Yeah, DC Tanner.
- It's Beckett.

09:21.130 --> 09:22.249
Oh, is that a fact?

09:22.250 --> 09:24.489
Had a bunch of Becketts recently,

09:25.101 --> 09:27.729
and that better not be wanking I'm
hearing in the background.

09:27.730 --> 09:30.169
You fell like a sack of shit
in that car park.

09:30.170 --> 09:34.170
If you hadn't've chased me,
she wouldn't be dead...

09:35.010 --> 09:37.461
I've pumped a batch of halal
meat full of toxin.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.169
It's already gone to market.

09:40.170 --> 09:41.689
Happy hunting.

09:41.714 --> 09:42.880
LINE GOES DEAD

09:48.770 --> 09:52.770
PHONE RINGS

09:54.883 --> 09:57.689
Ma'am, we've just had a call from
someone claiming to be Beckett,

09:57.690 --> 10:00.569
saying he's poisoned a batch, of
halal meat, he had detail,

10:00.570 --> 10:04.009
Ma'am, it's him. But we've traced
the call to a landline from a house

10:04.010 --> 10:06.213
in Manchester, we're moving now.

10:27.010 --> 10:31.010
POLICE SHOUT

10:36.170 --> 10:39.889
Standard far-right wallpaper and
me nan's furnishings. It's him.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.391
I want neighbours and landlord quizzed,

10:41.392 --> 10:44.169
I want all local CCTV pulled and scanned.

10:44.170 --> 10:45.769
Crusader fetish?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.173
It's butcher's gear...

10:48.570 --> 10:51.689
He must've known we'd trace it,
he's a hitman who shot a cop,

10:51.690 --> 10:53.129
he should be in Fiji by now.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.118
- Why bother?
- Viv?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.169
- What is it?
- Offal.

11:03.170 --> 11:04.489
Fridge is stacked full of it.

11:04.490 --> 11:08.329
He's pumping it full of I don't know
what. Food batch label...

11:08.330 --> 11:11.289
Call Food Standards for me,
would you, Sarge?

11:11.290 --> 11:14.169
Track the ID number, appreciate it.

11:14.170 --> 11:17.169
- Jonah, away.
- Gladly.

11:17.170 --> 11:19.133
Jonah, return.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.077
Comms, please.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.169
Professor Miller to Control...

11:25.170 --> 11:26.929
...this is Code Red.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.849
I want bio-hazard lads here,

11:28.850 --> 11:32.529
I want this entire street wrapped in
a hazmat suit, everyone else OUT.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.529
No, not us! We're staying here!

11:34.530 --> 11:35.866
You just said it was a Code Red?!

11:35.867 --> 11:39.849
Yeah, and if it's ricin we're playing
footsie in the morgue already. Shit.

11:39.850 --> 11:41.129
What is it?

11:41.130 --> 11:44.089
No, I mean, in this jar,
it's literally shit.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.089
OK, lab rat.

11:46.090 --> 11:50.433
Acetone, dextrose, rotten meat and
there's jam jars full of shit.

11:50.458 --> 11:51.849
It's not ricin, folks!

11:51.850 --> 11:55.434
It's botulin, he's pumping it
into the offal.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.809
Get everything to the lab kids,

11:57.810 --> 12:00.729
I want full toxicology report on the
botulin, midday latest.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.129
What is botulin?

12:02.130 --> 12:04.489
At its weakest, it smoothes out
your crow's feet,

12:04.490 --> 12:06.849
at its strongest, it's on every
dictator's Christmas list.

12:06.850 --> 12:08.849
But making is no easy trick and
though he's been

12:08.850 --> 12:10.929
Andy McNabbing his tits off,
Beckett's no PHD,

12:10.930 --> 12:13.649
Right, the Offal comes from an
abattoir called Halal Paddy's.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.413
They ship halal meat all round
Manchester.

12:15.414 --> 12:18.369
Viv, if he has pumped this shit into
anything, whoever eats it will

12:18.370 --> 12:20.889
have their guts wrung out so hard
they'd snap their neck to end it.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.129
Sergeant Kowalska, DC Tanner,

12:22.130 --> 12:26.130
the abattoir, find out what they
know about Beckett, keep it schtum.

12:28.885 --> 12:31.289
What are you waiting for?!

12:36.327 --> 12:39.295
We need a visible police presence
outside every polling station.

12:39.296 --> 12:41.849
- The public cannot feel...
- Viv, now is NOT the time.

12:41.850 --> 12:44.139
Ma'am, Mayor, Beckett's just claimed
to have poisoned a batch of

12:44.140 --> 12:45.647
halal meat with botulin.

12:45.648 --> 12:48.439
Now we need to recall ALL
halal meat products right now,

12:48.440 --> 12:51.871
takeaways, supermarkets, butchers,
schools. Not in that order.

12:52.416 --> 12:54.333
You're all right, you're on bento.

12:54.776 --> 12:57.335
That better be the Food Standards
Agency you're about to text,

12:57.336 --> 12:58.811
not your kids, sir.

12:58.812 --> 12:59.852
What do we know?

12:59.877 --> 13:01.895
That you need to authorise
the outbreak unit,

13:01.896 --> 13:04.061
make a public announcement,
knives 'n' forks down.

13:04.062 --> 13:07.055
No, which batch, which meat?
Chicken, beef?

13:07.056 --> 13:08.782
I'm not coming at you with
a fucking Pot Noodle, Sir!

13:08.783 --> 13:11.336
- Inspector!
- I don't know yet.

13:11.337 --> 13:13.535
SIRENS BLARE

13:13.536 --> 13:16.035
TYRES SCREECH

13:17.209 --> 13:19.848
- Nothing leaves these premises.
- Are you for real? Who's that?

13:19.849 --> 13:20.968
Can I help you?

13:20.969 --> 13:23.648
DS Kowalska, DC Tanner,
Manchester Met, you're the manager?

13:23.649 --> 13:25.248
Yeah, Paddy Kenny. Is there a problem?

13:25.249 --> 13:27.408
Mr Kenny, we need to chat
with you in private, please.

13:27.409 --> 13:28.768
It's quite urgent.

13:28.769 --> 13:31.368
It used to be Paddy & Sons
but we were going to ground

13:31.369 --> 13:32.768
so now it's Halal Paddy's.

13:32.769 --> 13:34.568
We've just had a halal inspection.

13:34.569 --> 13:36.968
It took us two years to win
the Sharia Council's trust.

13:36.969 --> 13:39.208
This is all halal, right down the line.

13:39.209 --> 13:42.728
It has to be with a community this
sensitive to taking the piss.

13:42.729 --> 13:44.728
But I've done the research though.

13:44.729 --> 13:48.128
Those Jihadis come for me, you just
whip out the Koran and you chant,

13:48.129 --> 13:51.368
"There is no other god but Allah
and Muhammad is his prophet."

13:51.369 --> 13:53.601
You're way off, sir. Your office, please.

13:54.489 --> 13:57.088
So you want me to publicly announce
to the people of Manchester

13:57.089 --> 13:59.448
that they may have already
ingested poisoned meat?

13:59.449 --> 14:02.288
That's your pitch when this could
all still be a prank?

14:02.289 --> 14:05.368
You need to work out what you want
your face next to in the news

14:05.369 --> 14:06.968
on the eve of an election, sir.

14:06.969 --> 14:10.969
Panic in the streets or a row of
stiffs in an outbreak tent?

14:12.249 --> 14:15.248
Alert all hospitals but no public
announcements till we know

14:15.249 --> 14:17.208
definitively which batch.

14:17.209 --> 14:21.209
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a radio interview to do.

14:23.129 --> 14:27.129
We use the media, Inspector,
they don't use us.

14:34.849 --> 14:37.528
- Paddy, what's going on?
- I need your staff to leave, please.

14:37.529 --> 14:39.448
Anything you say to me, you say to Omran.

14:39.449 --> 14:43.008
He's my Halal supervisor. Without
Omran we're haram and no mistake.

14:43.009 --> 14:45.536
Mr Kenny, we have reason to believe
your produce may've been infected

14:45.537 --> 14:46.639
with botulin.

14:46.664 --> 14:48.088
- You what?
- Oh, my God!

14:48.089 --> 14:50.088
Do you recognise this man?

14:50.089 --> 14:53.084
Ma'am, Dinah's on line two. It's urgent.

14:54.569 --> 14:57.168
- Dinah?
- Viv, this is real.

14:57.169 --> 14:58.688
The owners have ID'd Beckett.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.888
He worked on the cutting line.

15:00.889 --> 15:03.488
He'd have had access to inject
any batch he wanted.

15:03.489 --> 15:06.048
He last clocked off the day of the
hustings and Miller says

15:06.049 --> 15:08.528
once that shit's ingested,
symptoms start showing anywhere

15:08.529 --> 15:10.608
between 48 and 72 hours.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.161
That's now.

15:12.609 --> 15:15.048
Ma'am, Beckett worked in
the abattoir giving him every

15:15.049 --> 15:16.953
chance to pump the meat.

15:17.849 --> 15:19.928
Hang on, I know you.

15:19.929 --> 15:22.648
You're moving in opposite.
You copped an eyeful this morning!

15:22.649 --> 15:24.288
Let's do this properly.

15:24.289 --> 15:27.008
Inspector Deering,
meet my youngest, Louis.

15:27.649 --> 15:29.968
Your son?
Well, then, who was the older guy?

15:29.969 --> 15:31.824
My husband, David.

15:32.889 --> 15:35.608
Oh so, then we're...

15:35.609 --> 15:37.160
Neighbours.

15:37.769 --> 15:40.072
I'll see you tonight, Louis. Mum.

15:42.089 --> 15:45.248
Marilyn, if we don't put out an
announcement right now

15:45.249 --> 15:47.808
then the only way we're going to
know which batch he poisoned is

15:47.809 --> 15:49.888
when the first person kicks the bucket.

15:49.889 --> 15:52.648
We need to alert everyone.

15:52.649 --> 15:55.647
Mayor, your failure has left more
homeless kids sleeping rough

15:55.648 --> 15:58.340
in central Manchester,
it's heartbreaking.

15:58.341 --> 16:01.250
Miss McCoy, you're on record as
giving local government advice to

16:01.251 --> 16:04.168
big companies to cut down on heat
being generated

16:04.169 --> 16:08.712
outside their offices so as to
remove, and I quote "vagrants".

16:08.713 --> 16:10.968
And our next question is from Joe.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.128
What's your question, Joe?

16:12.129 --> 16:13.808
I didn't mean to kill her.

16:13.809 --> 16:17.288
She came at me with pepper spray
and left me no choice.

16:17.289 --> 16:20.248
I don't think that's quite how the
Manchester Met feel about it, Joe.

16:20.249 --> 16:23.448
- Jonah, tell 'em to hang up.
- Hang up, that's an order.

16:23.449 --> 16:26.488
I've sent a batch of halal beef
pumped full of botulin

16:26.489 --> 16:28.048
into a Manchester school, Mr Mayor.

16:28.049 --> 16:29.488
That's a very serious threat.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.928
- We shift beef to over 300 schools.
- Jesus!

16:31.929 --> 16:34.768
That is thousands of batches
Beckett could've injected.

16:34.769 --> 16:38.128
I tipped the cops off this morning.
Gave 'em plenty of time

16:38.129 --> 16:41.768
because they, and you,
let the children eat up anyway

16:41.769 --> 16:44.328
because they're scared of upsetting
the degenerates

16:44.329 --> 16:46.488
who cut our soldiers' heads off
on our streets.

16:46.489 --> 16:50.288
Jonah, tell the producer if it's
ratings he's after, patch me in!

16:50.289 --> 16:53.248
And if you think your white kids are
safe 'cos they don't eat halal,

16:53.249 --> 16:54.368
then tough.

16:54.369 --> 16:57.208
The schools have snuck halal meat
into all your kids' school dinners,

16:57.209 --> 16:59.888
and guess what, the Mayor did
nothing about it.

16:59.889 --> 17:01.048
This is DI Deering.

17:01.049 --> 17:03.747
You shot an unarmed officer dead
in a car park and now you've

17:03.748 --> 17:04.980
upgraded to bioterror?

17:04.981 --> 17:07.127
Who's the degenerate now, eh, Beckett?

17:07.128 --> 17:08.568
Who put you up to this?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.208
PHONE LINE GOES DEAD

17:10.209 --> 17:12.432
Ma'am, he's gone.

17:15.689 --> 17:18.088
Manchester, we've been tested before.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.808
Do not panic.

17:19.809 --> 17:22.528
Your children are safer
in their schools than out.

17:22.529 --> 17:26.048
Let the authorities handle it.
We will not let you down.

17:26.049 --> 17:28.288
Stand together.

17:28.289 --> 17:29.985
Hold fast.

17:32.729 --> 17:35.128
All phone networks are down.
Switchboards are jammed.

17:35.129 --> 17:36.928
No shit, Gavin, I get it.

17:36.929 --> 17:40.008
Fist fights are breaking out between
Muslim and non-Muslim parents

17:40.009 --> 17:41.563
outside every school gate in Manchester.

17:41.564 --> 17:44.528
- Twitter's in a meltdown.
- Who gives a twat about Twitter?

17:44.529 --> 17:45.928
It's spreading panic, Ma'am.

17:45.929 --> 17:47.768
They're saying we don't have manpower,

17:47.769 --> 17:49.674
the police are not fit for purpose.

17:50.409 --> 17:52.528
- We're being played.
- Sorry, ma'am?

17:52.529 --> 17:53.928
PHONE RINGS

17:53.929 --> 17:57.208
- Dinah, give me good news.
- Viv, think we've got it!

17:57.209 --> 18:00.848
Day of the hustings Beckett cut his
hand in the de-boning room.

18:00.849 --> 18:04.648
Injury report says he insisted on
finishing his shift so they

18:04.649 --> 18:06.488
sent him to the packing room
that afternoon.

18:06.489 --> 18:08.128
That has to be when he did it.

18:08.129 --> 18:11.008
Now we can trace which batches
went to which schools.

18:11.009 --> 18:14.038
Then what are you on the phone
to me for? Track it!

18:18.769 --> 18:20.808
Sorry, my fingers are sweating.

18:20.809 --> 18:21.896
Use this.

18:30.289 --> 18:33.248
Dammit! It keeps giving me
the same error screen.

18:33.249 --> 18:35.202
All the records for burger batches
have been deleted.

18:35.203 --> 18:36.822
What, so Beckett deleted the files?

18:36.823 --> 18:39.979
Impossible. Nobody can delete
the records apart from me and...

18:44.249 --> 18:45.887
I didn't know!

18:46.609 --> 18:47.814
Know what?

18:49.129 --> 18:53.008
Even though we'd gone full halal,
we were still in the red.

18:53.009 --> 18:54.183
I...

18:55.489 --> 18:58.475
I swapped the budget halal
burgers with...

19:00.409 --> 19:01.918
...the plain beef!

19:03.049 --> 19:04.408
Unblessed beef?

19:04.409 --> 19:07.448
No it was blessed, Omran,
it was still halal.

19:07.449 --> 19:10.688
I've got a blessing app on my iPad,

19:10.689 --> 19:13.888
We played it while we put the
frozen patties into the boxes.

19:13.889 --> 19:16.888
- You did what?
- It was Brexit!

19:16.889 --> 19:19.488
Half the workforce
have gone back to Europe!

19:19.489 --> 19:23.489
I can't afford you lot blessing
every throat before you cut it!

19:25.089 --> 19:28.008
- There is no other God but Allah!
- You broke the law!

19:28.009 --> 19:29.551
Just calm down.

19:30.969 --> 19:33.128
Oh forgive me, Omran!

19:33.129 --> 19:36.928
Punish only me, spare my kids!

19:36.929 --> 19:38.928
You ignorant moron!

19:38.929 --> 19:41.848
It's not Sharia law! It is UK law!

19:41.849 --> 19:43.647
Right?

19:44.649 --> 19:48.488
Omran, is there any other way
we can track the batch?

19:48.489 --> 19:49.799
I'm sorry.

19:53.249 --> 19:54.637
- Viv?
- Patrick Kenny,

19:54.662 --> 19:56.248
you're under arrest for false advertising

19:56.249 --> 19:58.743
- and food fraud.
- We've hit the fan here we've...

19:58.768 --> 20:00.273
Get up.

20:00.489 --> 20:01.677
What?

20:02.929 --> 20:04.765
Oh God!

20:15.740 --> 20:19.740
Viv, this doesn't make any sense.
It could be any one of 300 schools,

20:19.765 --> 20:22.059
why would Beckett poison a Neo-Nazi pub?

20:22.060 --> 20:23.670
Will one of you pointless
bastards just listen!

20:23.671 --> 20:26.539
- Get your hands off me!
- Sir! Sir!

20:26.540 --> 20:28.819
- VOMITS LOUDLY
- Over here, please, sir.

20:28.820 --> 20:31.459
I need you to tell me
everything your wife ate in the...

20:31.460 --> 20:33.539
They've got it all wrong!
She's anaphylactic.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.404
She's been trying to shift
the baby weight so she ate

20:35.405 --> 20:38.979
one of them cereal bars that says
may contain nuts, look!

20:38.980 --> 20:41.433
- She needs adrenaline!
- Do you serve meat from Halal Paddy's?!

20:41.434 --> 20:44.499
Do I look like I serve halal shite?!

20:44.500 --> 20:46.065
Just let me hold her hand!
She needs to see me...

20:46.066 --> 20:49.939
No, sir, just listen to me, OK?
This isn't nuts.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.819
Your wife could be
the victim of a bio-terror attack

20:52.820 --> 20:54.649
on poisoned burgers
that've gone to kids' schools,

20:54.650 --> 20:57.144
and that poison's gonna work
twice as fast on those kids

20:57.145 --> 20:59.849
as it is on your wife.
So you need to think.

21:00.363 --> 21:02.862
How did poisoned meat
get into your kitchen?

21:04.083 --> 21:06.282
There's some mad Chinese woman,
she sold us some meat,

21:06.283 --> 21:09.122
it was an under the counter thing.
We've bought meat from her before,

21:09.123 --> 21:10.602
I don't buy from any fly-by-night.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.922
- Lilly had one of the burgers.
- A name, Hamish.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.322
- Rita!
- Rita what?

21:15.323 --> 21:18.042
Wong, Wang, I don't know!

21:18.043 --> 21:19.480
She said she was a dinner lady-

21:19.505 --> 21:22.067
- What school?!
- I don't know!

21:23.483 --> 21:27.082
Spike, bring up all the schools
surrounding the Red Stag pub

21:27.083 --> 21:29.420
- that Halal Paddy supplied to.
- Yep.

21:31.323 --> 21:32.682
Yep, right, there's five.

21:32.683 --> 21:35.402
Swinton College, St Mary's Middle School,

21:35.403 --> 21:38.602
- Ironside Grammar, Ashton Primary...
- Ironside?

21:38.603 --> 21:42.603
That's where the mayor sends his
kids to school. Makes sense now.

21:44.123 --> 21:48.123
CHATTER

22:07.042 --> 22:11.042
OK, ladies and gentlemen.
Who's had school dinners? Hands up.

22:12.163 --> 22:13.934
This way, keep coming.

22:15.683 --> 22:17.639
This way, just gather over here please.

22:19.203 --> 22:20.762
Everyone, keep coming at the back.

22:20.763 --> 22:23.242
Is that the last one? Right, thank you.

22:23.243 --> 22:24.602
All right, my name's Spike.

22:24.603 --> 22:26.442
I'm just gonna ask you
a couple of questions.

22:26.443 --> 22:28.362
Anyone who had school dinners
this afternoon,

22:28.363 --> 22:29.863
can you put your hands up, please?

22:30.603 --> 22:34.603
Right, anybody who DIDN'T
have the burgers,

22:35.483 --> 22:37.215
put your hands down.

22:39.683 --> 22:41.522
Shit.

22:41.523 --> 22:45.523
Excuse me! Yeah, you're Rita,
right? Dinner lady?

22:45.963 --> 22:48.162
You sold halal burgers
to the chef at the Red Stag?

22:48.163 --> 22:50.242
- I want my lawyer.
- Those burgers were poisoned.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.465
Did you serve the rest to these kids?!

22:54.043 --> 22:57.015
Just take me to the patties, Rita!

22:59.363 --> 23:01.002
Anyone who's got stomach cramps,

23:01.003 --> 23:03.282
just come and make a line here, please.

23:03.283 --> 23:05.802
- GROANING
- Come on.

23:05.803 --> 23:07.642
OK, thank you.

23:07.643 --> 23:10.722
Anyone who's breathing a bit funny,
come and make a line here.

23:10.723 --> 23:14.723
THEY COUGH AND SPLUTTER

23:15.123 --> 23:16.922
OK.

23:16.923 --> 23:19.562
Right. Anyone who's got sweaty earlobes,

23:19.563 --> 23:20.922
come and stand here with me.

23:20.923 --> 23:24.923
They do feel a bit sweaty.

23:27.443 --> 23:28.842
Yeah, now, don't fret, kid.

23:28.843 --> 23:31.162
It'll be a drip in the arm
and a week off school,

23:31.163 --> 23:33.002
you'll be right as rain, and famous.

23:33.003 --> 23:35.682
Get 'em all on the anti-toxin,

23:35.683 --> 23:39.442
crash pads ready, yeah? Excellent man.

23:39.443 --> 23:43.830
Nah, not this, not these...

23:45.523 --> 23:48.122
this batch here. All here.

23:48.123 --> 23:49.482
Apart from, y'know.

23:49.483 --> 23:51.482
What I... stole. But hey...

23:51.483 --> 23:53.482
- All here?
- You try charging me with this,

23:53.483 --> 23:55.914
you're looking at a vegan
with an all-ethnic defence team.

23:55.915 --> 24:00.202
Rita! I don't give a shit!
What did you serve to the kids?!

24:00.203 --> 24:02.122
None of it, that's what I'm telling you.

24:02.123 --> 24:03.642
This is next week's meat!

24:03.643 --> 24:05.402
It's on a rota system with the abattoir.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.147
These burgers wouldn't been served
till a week Thursday.

24:10.603 --> 24:12.562
Saved by the bell, eh?

24:12.563 --> 24:16.141
Joseph Beckett has now targeted
all our children

24:16.142 --> 24:17.707
with a bio-attack
intended to tear us apart...

24:17.708 --> 24:20.682
One woman in hospital, no kids,
we thrashed the odds.

24:20.683 --> 24:22.242
I'd love to open the Babycham,

24:22.243 --> 24:25.482
but we survived today
by the skin of our teeth.

24:25.483 --> 24:27.216
And the mayor. Are his kids still here?

24:27.241 --> 24:28.548
No, his wife.

24:28.549 --> 24:30.362
She came and picked them up
just before lunch

24:30.363 --> 24:31.962
and that was right after he said to me,

24:31.963 --> 24:33.932
keep the attack under
your hat cos of panic.

24:33.957 --> 24:35.562
You are joking?

24:35.563 --> 24:37.922
Caroline, how long
have you been standing there?

24:37.923 --> 24:39.572
Long enough not to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

24:39.573 --> 24:42.122
I am sorry, Viv, but I am using this.

24:42.123 --> 24:45.522
Caroline, stop! Jonah,
you're supposed to be ahead of her,

24:45.523 --> 24:48.802
- Try it, Ma'am, she's a dachshund!
- And where were your kids, Mayor?

24:48.803 --> 24:50.282
Maybe you could explain to us all

24:50.283 --> 24:53.002
why your kids were whisked
out of school by your wife

24:53.003 --> 24:54.514
before Beckett made the announcement!

24:54.515 --> 24:56.682
My children had an appointment
that my wife,

24:56.683 --> 24:59.282
She just happened to remember? Seriously?

24:59.283 --> 25:02.802
After saying to the city
that our kids are safer in school

25:02.803 --> 25:05.882
and then you privately take
yours out. What's all that about?

25:05.883 --> 25:08.710
I am sorry that your kids
were targeted, sir,

25:08.711 --> 25:11.642
but you are supposed to
have all of our backs,

25:11.643 --> 25:15.206
not just your little 'uns.
You can't spin this one, can you?

25:15.207 --> 25:17.547
Has anybody got any more
questions for our mayor?

25:17.572 --> 25:19.427
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

25:21.403 --> 25:22.642
Tegan.

25:22.643 --> 25:25.202
Ma'am, it looks like Caddy
and his missus are checking in

25:25.203 --> 25:27.562
to a spa hotel for a dirty weekend.

25:27.563 --> 25:30.082
We're gonna need some
undercover room service...

25:30.083 --> 25:31.482
golfers...

25:31.483 --> 25:32.882
I could do the spa...

25:32.883 --> 25:35.242
As if Marilyn's gonna cough up for that.

25:35.243 --> 25:38.175
You're on your own.
Don't let Caddy out your sight.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.442
So who's buying it?

25:40.443 --> 25:42.642
Who's buying that this
shell-shocked far right thug

25:42.643 --> 25:44.729
- is Manchester's own Moriarty?
- He poisoned the burgers,

25:44.730 --> 25:47.335
he could've poisoned 24 dead kids.
I'm not not buying it.

25:47.336 --> 25:50.922
Yeah, but, if he meant that shit
on air, why give us the heads-up?

25:50.923 --> 25:54.602
He knew we'd trace the call,
find that food batch label.

25:54.603 --> 25:56.737
If Halal Paddy hadn't
been cooking the books,

25:56.738 --> 25:59.282
we'd've got to the school and
the meat wasn't supposed to be

25:59.283 --> 26:01.362
- served till next week.
- Exactly.

26:01.363 --> 26:04.162
Immigrants and kids,
they're not his real target...

26:04.163 --> 26:05.842
It's us.

26:05.843 --> 26:08.682
This whole day's been designed
to have us running round Manchester

26:08.683 --> 26:12.282
in a fucking shambles looking for
a needle in a very public haystack.

26:12.283 --> 26:16.042
And why would Beckett, why would he
want Manchester Met in the stocks?

26:16.043 --> 26:20.756
We were stretched, stretched to
near breaking point, underfunded,

26:20.883 --> 26:23.962
understaffed, and there's Dirkin,

26:23.963 --> 26:27.842
waiting in the wings with
a bang tidy offer for a buy-out.

26:27.843 --> 26:30.008
Now, it might mean
more beats on the street...

26:30.603 --> 26:32.482
But far right thugs.

26:32.483 --> 26:36.042
There's gonna be more of this,
and it's not if, it's when.

26:36.043 --> 26:39.922
Ma'am, Marchant's in your office,
with some spook in a suit.

26:39.923 --> 26:41.380
Dismissed.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.612
Dinah, can we just have a chat, please?

27:01.963 --> 27:06.475
Spike, it was Joy's wake...

27:09.363 --> 27:13.363
and we were both so blind drunk,
neither of...

27:15.403 --> 27:17.635
I think Alice is having an affair.

27:21.563 --> 27:23.135
Seriously?

27:27.203 --> 27:28.522
W...

27:28.523 --> 27:30.102
You think?

27:32.763 --> 27:35.703
Remember when Alice went on
that mindfulness weekend?

27:36.443 --> 27:38.309
I think it was then.

27:41.683 --> 27:43.242
How do you know?

27:43.243 --> 27:45.542
I don't. I just know her.

27:47.003 --> 27:48.922
And I've been ticking over
on this for weeks,

27:48.923 --> 27:52.122
and then from nowhere,
she says she wants to adopt.

27:52.123 --> 27:56.123
I mean, we talked about it
ages ago, but nothing serious.

27:56.403 --> 27:57.882
Yeah, I'd love another kid,

27:57.883 --> 28:00.788
but I just don't trust
what she's trying to fix.

28:01.955 --> 28:04.341
Anyway, that's what you're picking up on.

28:07.363 --> 28:08.868
What do you think?

28:14.763 --> 28:16.212
Well, um...

28:17.883 --> 28:19.324
I'm...

28:23.123 --> 28:25.762
I'm sort of outraged, actually.

28:25.763 --> 28:27.715
On Alice's behalf.

28:28.763 --> 28:31.202
Just cos she can't wait to see
the back of you for the weekend,

28:31.203 --> 28:32.972
you think she slept with someone?

28:34.643 --> 28:35.892
Spike!

28:39.083 --> 28:43.083
Dinah, sorry to interrupt.
You never make tea.

28:43.843 --> 28:46.337
Gavin, what is it?

28:47.163 --> 28:49.242
Ma'am wants to see you in her office.

28:49.243 --> 28:51.524
(THEY'VE CLOSED THE BLINDS.)

28:53.083 --> 28:54.842
- "They?"
- Marchant.

28:54.843 --> 28:57.523
And some Ken doll with a bum chin.

29:03.043 --> 29:04.438
Sergeant

29:05.763 --> 29:07.962
This is Chief Inspector Pembroke,
Special Branch.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.722
I'm only saying it for him
cos I know how much

29:09.723 --> 29:11.162
he practises it in the mirror.

29:11.163 --> 29:13.950
Would you care to explain
yourself, Sergeant?

29:15.523 --> 29:17.342
We pulled that in this morning.

29:21.268 --> 29:24.439
I buried my best friend
in the ground yesterday.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.242
I know what I risked,

29:27.243 --> 29:31.243
but you've got a UC
literally in bed with Dennis Caddy.

29:33.643 --> 29:35.122
So do what you want to me.

29:35.123 --> 29:36.359
But I want it on record

29:36.360 --> 29:38.882
that my approach towards
Bonnie Sands was entirely-

29:38.883 --> 29:40.919
With my full sanctioning.

29:42.083 --> 29:43.602
Well, we'll see about that.

29:43.603 --> 29:46.040
What was it that Sands said to you
when you approached her?

29:46.443 --> 29:48.760
You're Bonnie's handler,
you can ask her yourself.

29:51.043 --> 29:52.482
Holy shit.

29:52.483 --> 29:54.042
She gone rogue on you?

29:54.043 --> 29:55.682
It's complicated.

29:55.683 --> 29:57.636
It'd better be! Talk.

30:00.163 --> 30:03.442
Five months ago, we heard chatter
that Lionel Dirkin

30:03.443 --> 30:05.866
was grooming ex-soldiers
to commit a series of attacks.

30:05.867 --> 30:07.962
Tell me something I don't know.

30:07.963 --> 30:09.722
Well, Dirkin's untouchable.

30:09.723 --> 30:13.602
But Dennis Caddy is Dirkin's bagman,
hence Bonnie Sands.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.042
It was her idea.

30:15.043 --> 30:17.562
Who would think that
the police would plant a black UC

30:17.563 --> 30:19.162
in a far right group?

30:19.163 --> 30:20.562
It worked.

30:20.563 --> 30:23.042
She soon she informed us of
a sexual relationship with Caddy,

30:23.043 --> 30:25.562
- which we authorised.
- Well, why didn't she give us a heads-up

30:25.563 --> 30:27.527
on McCoy, or on Beckett?!

30:28.763 --> 30:32.282
Sands has broken all communication
with our team without explanation.

30:32.283 --> 30:34.857
Oh, Jesus.
You really do think she's turned.

30:34.858 --> 30:36.522
I was just taking the piss!

30:36.523 --> 30:37.682
What are you waiting for?!

30:37.683 --> 30:39.882
Pull her out. Abduct her if you have to!

30:39.883 --> 30:41.482
It's not that simple, Inspector!

30:41.483 --> 30:43.602
Extracting any officer's risky,

30:43.603 --> 30:45.482
and if we pull her out against her will,

30:45.483 --> 30:46.738
we can't stop her from returning to Caddy

30:46.739 --> 30:48.160
and giving the whole bloody game away!

30:48.185 --> 30:49.730
She's pregnant.

30:51.563 --> 30:54.270
In her basket, folic acid...

30:54.883 --> 30:58.883
If this is true, it's hardly
evidence that Sands hasn't turned.

30:59.243 --> 31:00.802
Let me approach her one more time.

31:00.803 --> 31:03.362
I'll find out if she's turned for real.

31:03.363 --> 31:04.722
- You?
- Yeah.

31:04.723 --> 31:07.962
It's my find, and the only thing
we do know is that

31:07.963 --> 31:09.962
she sure as shit's stopped trusting you.

31:09.963 --> 31:11.202
Sir.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.762
She is right. You said yourself
that Dirkin is untouchable

31:14.763 --> 31:16.042
and since Beckett's a ghost,

31:16.043 --> 31:18.202
the only link between them
is still Dennis Caddy,

31:18.203 --> 31:20.542
so if you've got
an agent in play, let's use her.

31:22.443 --> 31:24.082
Oh, come on, Tom.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.682
Pull your dick out of your Xbox
and phone your boss.

31:27.683 --> 31:30.444
You can tell him it was your idea.
You will anyway.

31:39.468 --> 31:43.468
I'm not racist. I'm just a mum
struggling to make ends meet.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.347
It was this one's birthday party today,

31:46.810 --> 31:49.067
and what if I'd have
fed her poisoned meat

31:49.068 --> 31:51.107
cos I didn't know it was halal?

31:51.108 --> 31:54.507
We should've been told.
The Mayor should've told us!

31:54.508 --> 31:56.897
I could've lost her!

31:58.668 --> 32:01.147
- Sorry.
- It's not even her kid.

32:01.148 --> 32:03.267
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it!

32:03.777 --> 32:05.627
She's got him ironing
her power suits now,

32:05.628 --> 32:07.387
whilst cooking the dinner.

32:07.388 --> 32:09.547
Viv, you can't curtain-twitch your boss!

32:09.548 --> 32:12.071
She'll be doing the same to me
as soon as she's got hers put up!

32:13.668 --> 32:15.159
Oh, no!

32:16.708 --> 32:18.886
No, no, oh, she's coming over!

32:20.268 --> 32:22.667
Right, this house is going
on the market first thing.

32:22.668 --> 32:24.761
- What'll you tell her?
- Damp!

32:25.908 --> 32:27.628
Hello, neighbour.

32:28.708 --> 32:30.684
Shouldn't this be the other way round?

32:31.828 --> 32:33.196
Come in.

32:36.694 --> 32:39.293
Pembroke's just called.

32:39.748 --> 32:42.827
Special Branch have consented for
you to approach Bonnie Sands

32:42.828 --> 32:45.587
to see if she's fit enough to remain
undercover with Caddy.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.347
With one caveat.

32:47.348 --> 32:50.987
If anything happens to Sands,
the blame lands at your feet.

32:50.988 --> 32:53.427
And the glory we share around,
am I right, Ma'am?

32:53.428 --> 32:55.675
What you waiting for? Approach.

33:00.508 --> 33:01.874
Er, wait.

33:01.899 --> 33:03.236
You're driving.

33:03.261 --> 33:05.899
- Where are we going?
- Fact checking.

33:06.508 --> 33:10.508
MOB SHOUTS

33:17.454 --> 33:19.082
He's expecting us.

33:22.508 --> 33:25.867
But halal isn't a snuck in E-number,
it's a religious choice which means

33:25.868 --> 33:28.587
that everybody should be informed if
they're eating it or not.

33:28.588 --> 33:32.588
Not because they're a racist,
they might be an animal rights...

33:33.068 --> 33:36.387
Nobody had heard of her a week ago
and now she could win.

33:36.388 --> 33:38.187
So this is the first time in four years

33:38.188 --> 33:40.947
I've been home to cook
dinner for my wife.

33:40.948 --> 33:42.427
What do you want, Inspector?

33:42.428 --> 33:44.707
For you to spill the beans
on Lionel Dirkin.

33:44.708 --> 33:47.146
There's a rumour of him trying to
buy out the Manchester Met.

33:47.868 --> 33:50.067
You think he's involved in this?

33:50.068 --> 33:51.858
Just the beans, sir.

33:52.908 --> 33:53.909
It's no rumour.

33:53.910 --> 33:57.187
Dirkin wants to buy out forensics
and to put his people on the street.

33:57.188 --> 34:00.627
Every time it's been voted for,
it's been closed council meetings.

34:00.628 --> 34:03.467
Press and police have been
asked to leave.

34:03.468 --> 34:06.507
Trust me, the deal's attractive,
it would save hundreds of cuts.

34:06.508 --> 34:09.838
Dirkin's given out backhanders,
but I've blocked him every time.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.786
Nobody can sell off the police
in good conscience

34:12.788 --> 34:14.525
to that racist prick.

34:15.068 --> 34:16.748
He's dangerous.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.418
Permission to go give
Dirkin a poke, Ma'am?

34:20.444 --> 34:22.212
Granted, Inspector.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.322
Den?

34:32.568 --> 34:33.674
I wouldn't.

34:34.487 --> 34:37.565
- Not in your condition.
- Dennis, wake up, we've got to go.

34:37.748 --> 34:39.306
Your full name's Bonnie Marie Sands.

34:39.308 --> 34:41.147
Hey, over here, we've got a stalker here!

34:41.148 --> 34:42.706
Your birthday's 27th May 1989.

34:42.708 --> 34:45.187
Jesus Christ, shut up!
He could wake any sec!

34:45.188 --> 34:47.107
- No, he won't.
- How do you know?

34:47.108 --> 34:51.108
See that barmaid? She's roofied him.

34:51.148 --> 34:55.148
Pembroke thinks you've turned.
What do you think you're doing?

34:56.108 --> 34:58.467
HE SNORTS

34:58.468 --> 35:00.010
Idiot!

35:00.548 --> 35:04.107
He's done so much coke it'd take
an elephant gun to knock him out.

35:04.668 --> 35:06.282
Screw this.

35:06.748 --> 35:08.282
What you doing?

35:12.868 --> 35:15.347
I've been waiting for him
to pass out all night.

35:15.348 --> 35:17.547
- You've just sped up my vanishing act.
- Where you going?

35:17.548 --> 35:19.151
To London to tell Special
Branch I'm done.

35:19.176 --> 35:20.634
Cos you're pregnant?

35:22.988 --> 35:26.169
Cos you and Pembroke are going
to get me killed!

35:26.788 --> 35:28.707
Sleeping beauty's awake.

35:28.708 --> 35:30.666
Stall.

35:32.468 --> 35:34.498
Is everything OK, Sir?

35:34.499 --> 35:37.947
- Where's she gone?
- Bedroom, I think.

35:37.948 --> 35:41.387
Sorry, mate, your girlfriend
took your keys

35:41.388 --> 35:43.556
and went out with her mate.

35:46.668 --> 35:48.627
Sir, come here a sec.

35:48.628 --> 35:51.307
I shouldn't really be saying this,
but they're messing with you,

35:51.308 --> 35:52.547
there is no mate.

35:52.548 --> 35:54.667
Wait, you can't walk now.

35:54.668 --> 35:57.147
Those guys have been staring
at your girlfriend all night.

35:57.148 --> 35:58.587
They haven't got a room booking.

35:58.588 --> 36:00.147
There's no business event here

36:00.148 --> 36:02.667
and they keep raising
their wrists to their mouths

36:02.668 --> 36:04.507
like they're smelling perfume.

36:04.508 --> 36:08.467
Right, yeah. Hey! You following me?

36:08.468 --> 36:10.883
I'm fucking sick of it! It's harassment!

36:12.788 --> 36:14.779
I've just bought you 30 seconds.

36:15.748 --> 36:18.107
I told you I'm fucking done!

36:18.108 --> 36:19.747
I can't do this.

36:19.748 --> 36:21.387
This is my only way out.

36:21.388 --> 36:24.027
Albion follow me everywhere,
I had to get him alone, this is it.

36:24.028 --> 36:25.680
Beckett poisoned that meat for real.

36:25.681 --> 36:29.587
Caddy's the only way we can catch
him, you've got to trust me.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.747
I don't owe you anything.

36:31.748 --> 36:33.227
No.

36:33.228 --> 36:34.708
No, you don't.

36:38.068 --> 36:39.387
But you owe her.

36:39.388 --> 36:43.388
You may not have remembered Joy
but she remembered you.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.451
SHE GASPS

36:51.228 --> 36:55.228
Swimming pool, one hour.

36:59.548 --> 37:01.307
You're awake?

37:01.308 --> 37:03.795
Thought I was going to have to carry
you to bed in the luggage rack.

37:04.508 --> 37:06.907
- Where you going?
- I just left this.

37:06.908 --> 37:08.799
C'mon, it's freezing.

37:13.188 --> 37:14.552
Bonnie...

37:21.388 --> 37:22.887
...do the thing.

37:26.268 --> 37:28.023
CAR BLEEPS

37:41.548 --> 37:42.707
Can I help you, madam?

37:42.732 --> 37:46.494
You steer well clear of me
or I'll flash this and yell botulin.

37:49.348 --> 37:52.147
Dirkin, I've got a bone to pick with you.

37:52.148 --> 37:54.695
Antoine, can you give us
a few moments, please?

37:56.228 --> 37:59.526
Well, you certainly live up to your
reputation, Inspector. Please.

38:01.108 --> 38:02.824
- Darren?
- Yes, sir.

38:02.825 --> 38:04.562
More water, please.

38:07.388 --> 38:08.777
Where's Beckett?

38:09.268 --> 38:12.307
- Isn't that your job?
- Don't fuck with me, Dirkin.

38:12.308 --> 38:14.587
You pulled the halal stunt to
humiliate the police.

38:14.588 --> 38:16.547
Outrageous, I'm calling my lawyer.

38:16.548 --> 38:18.587
And to oust Hassan and force the council

38:18.588 --> 38:20.295
to accept your security contracts.

38:20.296 --> 38:24.748
Antonia, I'm being harassed by
a podgy Boadicea with a badge.

38:25.348 --> 38:28.192
No, that's fine, I'll keep schtum.

38:33.094 --> 38:34.465
Mmm.

38:34.958 --> 38:38.397
I can assure you, the only thing
that beef is blessed with

38:38.548 --> 38:40.004
is good old English mustard.

38:40.005 --> 38:41.933
HE CHORTLES

38:47.201 --> 38:49.460
HE CHOKES

38:57.228 --> 38:59.147
My officer died.

38:59.148 --> 39:02.107
It's not choking that you need
to be scared about,

39:02.108 --> 39:03.747
you jowly piece of shit.

39:03.748 --> 39:04.728
It's me.

39:04.729 --> 39:07.227
Now, one blink for yes,
and two blinks for no.

39:07.228 --> 39:08.979
Do you know where Beckett is?

39:11.388 --> 39:14.148
I said blink.

39:19.548 --> 39:23.548
Help, quick, he's choking! Help!

39:24.788 --> 39:27.311
All you're doing is giving him
brain damage and a hard-on!

39:27.312 --> 39:28.711
Give over!

39:32.108 --> 39:35.467
C'mon, big D, cough it up!

39:37.468 --> 39:41.267
I am going to have your job,
you mad bitch!

39:41.268 --> 39:44.307
Whoever becomes Mayor,
come day one you are fired.

39:44.308 --> 39:47.907
What for? I just saved your life.

39:47.908 --> 39:49.307
And I've witnesses.

39:49.308 --> 39:51.467
DINERS APPLAUD

39:51.468 --> 39:53.489
Think on.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.879
You told Pembroke I was pregnant?

39:59.188 --> 40:02.027
It was the only way to convince him
you hadn't fallen in love with Caddy

40:02.052 --> 40:04.291
- and lost your mind.
- Albion got positive there was a rat.

40:04.316 --> 40:06.435
I had to tell Dennis I was
pregnant to keep him close.

40:06.460 --> 40:08.579
- And Caddy's the father?
- Not a chance.

40:08.788 --> 40:11.467
Dennis's balls are clinically drier
than a witch's tit.

40:11.468 --> 40:13.267
- He thinks it's a miracle.
- So who is?

40:13.268 --> 40:14.723
What's it to you?

40:15.148 --> 40:17.227
It's not a problem and it worked.

40:17.228 --> 40:18.987
Faye, Albion, they still suspect me

40:18.988 --> 40:20.697
but Dennis thinks I'm his golden goose.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.347
So why bolt now?

40:22.348 --> 40:25.767
Cos I am feeling sectionable
pretending to be in love with

40:25.768 --> 40:27.987
a neo-Nazi and I've got this mental
bint jumping out at me

40:27.988 --> 40:29.507
like a Jack in a box!

40:29.508 --> 40:31.267
I can't risk it any more.

40:31.268 --> 40:33.147
That's why I brought him here.

40:33.148 --> 40:36.307
It's the only place I can be sure
Albion aren't following me.

40:36.308 --> 40:38.507
Why didn't you warn us about
the attack on McCoy?

40:38.508 --> 40:40.827
I didn't know what Dennis was
planning until literally

40:40.828 --> 40:43.347
the last second,
and I thought it would be Hassan.

40:43.348 --> 40:46.147
That's why I threw the squash
at him to get us on your radar!

40:46.148 --> 40:48.519
- Faye has got eyes on me like a hawk.
- It wasn't enough.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.307
I had no idea about Beckett.

40:52.308 --> 40:55.083
Dennis had never even mentioned him
until this.

40:55.708 --> 40:57.606
Pembroke's on the scrapheap.

40:57.607 --> 40:59.387
Meet your new handler.

40:59.901 --> 41:01.507
Are you mad?

41:01.508 --> 41:04.587
She's nearly got me killed
twice in a day, no way!

41:04.588 --> 41:07.067
Sergeant Kowalska's my best.

41:07.068 --> 41:08.927
I'd keep that quiet.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.274
Caddy's the best chance of
getting to Beckett.

41:12.275 --> 41:14.821
You're the best chance we have
of getting to Caddy.

41:33.588 --> 41:36.067
If this is a cry for help,
it's a shit one

41:36.068 --> 41:38.707
cos we're not diving in after!

41:38.708 --> 41:41.019
Dinah, kick off your shoes.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.307
Drop the surveillance.

42:02.308 --> 42:03.707
If we drop the surveillance,

42:03.708 --> 42:05.507
Caddy'll just think we have
another way in.

42:05.508 --> 42:07.187
Gold star, Sherlock,

42:07.188 --> 42:10.603
and he'll have to trust me more
and then he'll have to act.

42:11.388 --> 42:14.683
You want to handle me?
That's the handshake.

42:25.788 --> 42:27.809
She thinks she knows everything.

42:28.788 --> 42:30.920
Welcome to my world.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.387
We've got a mole, and I want its name.

42:39.388 --> 42:41.827
You go anywhere near my daughter,
you pointless bitch,

42:41.828 --> 42:43.347
I'll split you in two!

42:43.348 --> 42:45.147
I just need to know if it's
black or white.

42:45.148 --> 42:46.913
I've been asked to pack for a departure.

42:46.914 --> 42:48.467
All phones to be left behind.

42:48.468 --> 42:50.829
Categorically I cannot wear a wire.

42:50.830 --> 42:53.747
We haven't led Bonnie down
the garden path here, have we?

42:53.748 --> 42:55.627
Who called this in as a murder, Moss?

42:55.628 --> 42:57.083
Shouting Beckett's name's not helpful.

42:57.084 --> 42:58.486
Not catching him's not helpful.

42:58.487 --> 42:59.912
We need to get Sam's clothes off him.

42:59.937 --> 43:01.587
Why not? Everybody else has!

43:01.588 --> 43:03.529
I don't like what you're asking me to do!

43:03.530 --> 43:06.947
Your whole campaign's been based on
"I will not back down".

43:06.948 --> 43:08.191
- No!
- No!

43:08.216 --> 43:09.341
You need to leave now!

43:09.342 --> 43:12.064
- Inspector Deering?
- She's on the warpath, so...

43:13.028 --> 43:14.607
Spike, now!

43:16.428 --> 43:19.347
Everyone stay back,
until we establish no booby traps.

43:19.348 --> 43:21.855
If Beckett's been here, we need to know.
