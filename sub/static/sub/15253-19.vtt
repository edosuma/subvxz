00:00.132 --> 00:02.366
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few
things that you might need to know.</i>

00:02.367 --> 00:04.777
I'm putting together a new team,
and I want you to lead them.

00:04.812 --> 00:07.968
So this was your idea? Use my father's
program to make your own Intersects?

00:07.970 --> 00:10.505
Vicki, no! Don't shoot!

00:10.573 --> 00:12.038
Chuck,

00:12.106 --> 00:13.974
are you about to disarm a
nuclear bomb using fruit juice?

00:18.212 --> 00:21.315
Agent Bartowski,
you will oversee all aspects

00:21.383 --> 00:22.849
of the Intersect project
from here on out.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.586
Mrs. Woodcomb?
Yes?

00:25.654 --> 00:27.654
I believe that I
have something of yours.

00:27.721 --> 00:29.255
Great news.

00:29.323 --> 00:31.891
I found my dad's computer.

00:36.797 --> 00:38.197
Wow, Dad.

00:42.403 --> 00:43.468
Still at it, babe?

00:43.536 --> 00:45.003
Yeah.

00:45.070 --> 00:47.172
Did you get Clara down?

00:47.239 --> 00:48.940
Um...

00:49.008 --> 00:51.677
Hon?
What?

00:51.744 --> 00:53.878
Oh, my God.

00:53.946 --> 00:56.381
I'm so sleep deprived, I...

00:56.449 --> 00:58.216
I'm not tired,
although I feel...

00:58.284 --> 00:59.750
I feel totally awake, you know?

00:59.818 --> 01:02.019
You're in the zone.
How's it going?

01:02.086 --> 01:05.355
My dad's work is so amazing.
I've never seen such

01:05.424 --> 01:08.359
creative experimentation
in neuroplasticity before.

01:08.427 --> 01:11.629
His mind is... incredible.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.297
That's probably where
Clara gets it.

01:13.365 --> 01:16.399
She said "arthroscopic"
yesterday.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.368
Honey, if Clara can
say "arthroscopic"

01:18.436 --> 01:21.270
she needs to stop
pooping her pants.

01:22.406 --> 01:24.073
You sure you should be
digging around

01:24.141 --> 01:25.575
on your dad's computer?

01:25.643 --> 01:27.076
I mean, like you said,
what if it's...

01:27.144 --> 01:28.445
dangerous?

01:28.512 --> 01:29.779
Well, I don't know.

01:29.847 --> 01:32.214
But I've never seen anything
like this before, Devon.

01:32.281 --> 01:33.882
I think that he was working

01:33.950 --> 01:35.917
on getting the neural circuitry
in the brain

01:35.985 --> 01:38.587
to reorganize itself. It's...

01:38.655 --> 01:41.223
It's fascinating.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.058
Don't worry, honey.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.060
What's the worst
that could happen?

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:04.278 --> 02:05.579
Good morning, team.

02:05.646 --> 02:08.514
As you know, today begins
the agency's new agenda:

02:08.583 --> 02:10.449
find Intersect candidates

02:10.518 --> 02:13.353
who are as similar
to Agent Bartowski as possible.

02:13.421 --> 02:14.621
Thank you for joining us,
Director.

02:14.689 --> 02:17.791
The Intersect
clearly works better in Chuck

02:17.859 --> 02:20.826
than in anyone Director Bentley
was able to find.

02:20.894 --> 02:23.128
Ouch. So sorry.

02:23.196 --> 02:25.664
This time our search
will be led by the only man

02:25.732 --> 02:27.633
who really knows what it's like
to be an Intersect.

02:27.701 --> 02:30.770
Chuck, we need you to find
more Chucks.

02:30.837 --> 02:32.337
Well, it's going to be tough,

02:32.406 --> 02:34.774
you know... broke the mold,
etcetera.

02:34.841 --> 02:36.541
Just a reminder...
you are all to provide support

02:36.609 --> 02:40.011
to Agent Bartowski
in any way he requires.

02:40.078 --> 02:41.713
Chuck, you're in charge.

02:41.781 --> 02:43.014
Thank you, General.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.951
In charge. Well, man,

02:47.019 --> 02:48.352
I'm-I'm-I'm moved, here.

02:48.421 --> 02:50.622
I'm so proud of you. Well, thanks.
I-I appreciate

02:50.689 --> 02:52.322
the sentiment, Morgan. But it's
really not that big a deal.

02:52.390 --> 02:55.158
Although it does seem like it's
been four years in the making.

02:55.226 --> 02:57.628
Glad it hasn't gone to
your head. I'm just saying,

02:57.695 --> 02:59.195
I may have saved the city

02:59.263 --> 03:02.633
by disarming a nuclear bomb
using a juice box... Yes, you did.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.201
But, be careful, 'cause remember
last time you were in charge,

03:05.269 --> 03:07.337
you led our party
of D and D adventurers

03:07.405 --> 03:08.504
to their fiery deaths.

03:09.706 --> 03:11.874
We've been over this,
Morgan, okay?

03:11.942 --> 03:13.976
If Tom had cast the spell

03:14.044 --> 03:15.711
of confusion, then we would have
been out of that situation...

03:15.779 --> 03:16.913
Well anyway...

03:16.980 --> 03:18.180
that's neither here nor there!

03:18.248 --> 03:20.382
But I do want to address the
elephant in the room,

03:20.451 --> 03:22.184
which is, you know,
"reporting to me,"

03:22.252 --> 03:26.054
which can be a little weird or
awkward for some of you...

03:27.289 --> 03:28.857
But I think you're all
very important.

03:28.925 --> 03:30.224
I hope you enjoy this.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.894
I'll be back in charge
as soon as you and your...

03:32.962 --> 03:35.831
stupid pocket protector
screw it up.

03:35.898 --> 03:37.466
Um, excuse me.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.533
Pocket protectors are
not only very practical,

03:39.601 --> 03:41.769
they are required
Buy More attire, lady.

03:41.837 --> 03:45.272
Okay! Well, using my own
personality as a guide,

03:45.340 --> 03:49.009
I've created an extensive
psychological profile.

03:49.077 --> 03:51.044
Langley culled their database
for matches

03:51.112 --> 03:53.948
and sent me four spies
that are perfect candidates.

03:54.015 --> 03:55.248
They're going to be here
in an hour.

03:55.316 --> 03:59.418
Good Lord.
Four more Chucks.

03:59.487 --> 04:01.354
All right. First up is Lewis.

04:01.421 --> 04:03.356
Tech-ops specialist.

04:03.423 --> 04:05.725
Star hacker by the age of 14.

04:05.793 --> 04:08.294
His Warcraft Guild took down
Deathwing, World First.

04:08.362 --> 04:09.629
No.
Yes.

04:09.697 --> 04:11.730
And the coolest part...

04:11.798 --> 04:12.998
Good afternoon.

04:13.065 --> 04:15.367
He spent some time in England.

04:15.434 --> 04:17.235
So he has a
delightful English accent.

04:17.303 --> 04:19.337
CHUCK
Josie.

04:19.404 --> 04:20.873
Psy-ops genius.

04:20.940 --> 04:22.273
A real feeler and emoter,

04:22.341 --> 04:24.877
with a scary sense of intuition,
which makes her great

04:24.944 --> 04:25.878
in the interrogation room.

04:25.945 --> 04:27.145
I get it.

04:27.213 --> 04:29.079
You had to get a girl
to find someone

04:29.147 --> 04:30.815
as feely as you.

04:32.985 --> 04:33.951
Bogie. Get down!

04:34.019 --> 04:34.952
N- n-no.
No, no, no.

04:35.020 --> 04:35.987
Not a bogie, guys.
Not a bogie.

04:36.054 --> 04:37.021
This is Damian.

04:37.088 --> 04:38.756
Former Navy Seal.
Marksman award.

04:38.824 --> 04:40.290
But because of his appearance,

04:40.358 --> 04:43.093
he's been typecast
by the Agency.

04:43.161 --> 04:46.095
Spent the last ten years

04:46.163 --> 04:47.397
embedded in and he's really sick
of the desert.

04:47.464 --> 04:48.598
Which kind of reminded me of...

04:48.666 --> 04:50.433
when I was stuck
in the Buy More.

04:50.501 --> 04:54.437
I think he could really shine
in an opportunity like this.

04:54.505 --> 04:58.141
And last,
but the opposite of least...

05:00.510 --> 05:02.011
Wow.

05:02.078 --> 05:05.614
Brody. The Brodster.

05:05.682 --> 05:07.449
Nerdy. Emotional.

05:07.517 --> 05:09.685
Into his family and friends.

05:09.753 --> 05:11.787
Disarmingly attractive.

05:13.690 --> 05:14.823
Dear God, there's another one.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.960
Okay. Let's get to work, huh?

05:19.028 --> 05:21.095
<i>Casey, you'll be
handling physical testing.</i>

05:23.832 --> 05:26.100
<i>Sarah, you'll handle
psychological evaluations.</i>

05:26.168 --> 05:27.835
So. You're in the field

05:27.903 --> 05:29.704
and you have a conflict
with your partner.

05:29.772 --> 05:31.472
What do you do?
You want me to say

05:31.540 --> 05:32.773
that I'd talk about it
right away.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.141
But what I'd really do
is manipulate my partner

05:35.209 --> 05:36.677
into doing what I want.

05:36.744 --> 05:37.978
And Morgan...

05:38.046 --> 05:39.546
<i>you're in charge of evaluating</i>

05:39.614 --> 05:41.481
<i>the candidates' cultural
knowledge.</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:44.517
Quick: Rush's best album.

05:44.586 --> 05:46.152
Ah!

05:46.220 --> 05:47.587
Caress of Steel.

05:47.654 --> 05:49.555
No. Next!

05:56.964 --> 05:58.631
if everyone can just be civil.

05:58.699 --> 06:00.967
Charlton Heston sci-fi question
for you.

06:01.034 --> 06:04.569
<i>What's cooler: Soylent Green
or Omega Man?</i>

06:04.637 --> 06:06.871
<i>Trick question: POTA.</i>

06:06.939 --> 06:08.172
Wow.

06:14.313 --> 06:17.115
Hwah! Hwah! Hwah! Hwah!

06:24.223 --> 06:25.990
Can somebody bring Lewis
an icepack?

06:26.057 --> 06:28.326
Favorite Bond: Connery excluded.

06:28.393 --> 06:30.060
I have no opinion about
any of this.

06:30.129 --> 06:31.996
Why do men care so much
about these things?

06:32.063 --> 06:35.199
Nothing you're asking me
matters at all.

06:35.267 --> 06:37.367
What on earth
is she talking about?

06:46.310 --> 06:48.945
I'd talk about it, right away,
for as long as it takes.

06:49.013 --> 06:50.614
Nothing should ever wait
or be left unsaid.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.048
Sometimes it's best
to say things

06:52.116 --> 06:53.616
two or three times, even.

06:53.683 --> 06:57.453
Most important graphic novelist:
Grant Morrison

06:57.521 --> 06:59.221
or Moore/Gibbons?

06:59.289 --> 07:01.590
Kind of a Brian Vaughn man,
myself.

07:01.658 --> 07:03.626
Actually...

07:03.693 --> 07:05.394
I've always secretly felt
that way.

07:10.533 --> 07:13.468
So, time to pick
a new Intersect.

07:13.536 --> 07:14.702
You ready, Chuck?

07:20.776 --> 07:22.377
Yes.

07:22.444 --> 07:24.111
Yes. I'm ready.

07:24.179 --> 07:25.111
I was, uh,

07:25.180 --> 07:26.380
I was honestly feeling...

07:26.447 --> 07:27.548
kind of nervous earlier.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.549
But I went upstairs,

07:28.616 --> 07:30.617
got a little fresh air, and now

07:30.685 --> 07:32.085
I am ready.

07:32.153 --> 07:34.321
I just feel bad for the others,

07:34.389 --> 07:37.057
though, you know? I mean...

07:37.124 --> 07:38.992
We've really started to become
friends through all this.

07:39.060 --> 07:40.126
I'm the "cool boss."
Yes,

07:40.194 --> 07:41.327
you are incredibly cool.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.761
Now, who are you
going to choose?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.331
Well, what's your vote?

07:45.399 --> 07:46.765
I mean, just because
I'm in charge

07:46.833 --> 07:48.434
doesn't mean I don't value
your opinion.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.769
My opinion is,
you're going to screw it up.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.308
What is the diff...

07:55.375 --> 07:56.575
Man, she hates me.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.310
Well, you did steal her job.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.411
You're her nemesis.

07:59.478 --> 08:00.845
I hate being a nemesis.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.780
Maybe I should take her
out to coffee.

08:02.848 --> 08:04.449
Bentley's no joke.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.685
You should stop trying to
befriend her and watch your back.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.886
The only thing that's going to
make her look worse than this

08:08.954 --> 08:11.623
whole Greta debacle is you
succeeding where she and I couldn't.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.257
Now...

08:13.325 --> 08:14.592
who's the new Intersect?

08:22.634 --> 08:23.567
Nice!

08:26.070 --> 08:28.304
What are you doing?

08:39.317 --> 08:49.318

Is it big BM day?

09:19.298 --> 09:21.733
That's the best kind of day
there is.

09:21.801 --> 09:23.267
Now hand me some of them flyers,

09:23.335 --> 09:25.069
and let's sell some TVs.

09:25.137 --> 09:26.170
I'm-I'm sorry, Big Mike.

09:26.238 --> 09:27.338
Why are you wearing
the big B.M.?

09:27.406 --> 09:28.606
I thought that we retired it.

09:28.674 --> 09:32.143
It's for the new
LED flat-screen TV sale.

09:32.210 --> 09:35.345
The Large Mart has the same
promotion going on today.

09:35.413 --> 09:37.280
Those bastards!

09:37.348 --> 09:38.482
They don't respect us.

09:38.550 --> 09:40.283
I mean, the last five promotions
that we've had,

09:40.351 --> 09:41.652
Large Mart has had
the same ones!

09:41.719 --> 09:43.687
If we don't do something special

09:43.755 --> 09:46.156
they are going to hand us
our head in a handbasket,

09:46.223 --> 09:47.891
just like always.

09:47.959 --> 09:49.525
I don't know if that's...
quite the expression.

09:49.593 --> 09:50.626
But, l-l-let me tell you
something.

09:50.694 --> 09:52.462
You do not have to sell yourself
like this.

09:52.529 --> 09:53.763
Say what?

09:53.831 --> 09:56.532
Other men wear collared shirts
all day,

09:56.600 --> 09:57.633
while I get to wear a...

09:57.701 --> 09:59.669
a great big B.M. on my chest!

09:59.736 --> 10:02.004
That's job satisfaction.

10:02.072 --> 10:03.473
If you say so.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.640
You know, son,
as leader of the Buy More,

10:05.708 --> 10:06.975
you set the tone.

10:07.042 --> 10:08.877
Look, I know you got
a lot going on here.

10:08.945 --> 10:09.878
But remember,

10:09.946 --> 10:12.881
the Buy More is a special place.

10:12.949 --> 10:15.216
It can be fun here!

10:15.284 --> 10:17.318
Okay. Okay. You're right.

10:17.386 --> 10:18.319
You know what?

10:18.387 --> 10:21.189
Let's have some fun, huh?

10:21.256 --> 10:23.156
All right. That a boy.

10:28.864 --> 10:31.231
Hey! Hey! No!

10:31.299 --> 10:33.066
Aah... Hey!

10:33.134 --> 10:34.969
Hey!

10:48.382 --> 10:50.917
Hey, gang.

10:50.985 --> 10:53.685
Say, uh, has anyone seen Brody?

10:53.753 --> 10:54.786
No.

10:54.854 --> 10:55.854
No.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.088
Haven't seen him.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.725
Huh. All right.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.462
Well, I guess Chuck has made
his choice. Nobody ever picks me.

11:13.438 --> 11:14.705
Hey, Devon, what's up?

11:14.773 --> 11:16.140
I think I have some bad news.

11:16.207 --> 11:17.909
Ellie's been working
on your dad's computer.

11:17.976 --> 11:18.943
What?!

11:19.011 --> 11:20.444
That was supposed to be

11:20.512 --> 11:22.713
under lock and key.
How did she get it back?

11:22.781 --> 11:24.815
She said some woman
brought it over.

11:24.883 --> 11:27.017
Told her that the Buy More
tech dudes

11:27.084 --> 11:30.053
gave it to her by mistake.
No, no, no, no, no.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.756
Chuck, I would
have told you sooner,

11:32.823 --> 11:35.559
but I didn't think
she'd find anything.

11:35.626 --> 11:37.961
But Chuck,
she's making progress.

11:38.029 --> 11:41.897
Okay, look, it is very
important... imperative even...

11:41.965 --> 11:43.666
that we stop that work
immediately.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.467
You should see how
happy she's been.

11:45.535 --> 11:48.771
I think the work is making her
feel close to your dad again.

11:51.174 --> 11:53.475
Listen, I'm stuck here
for a little bit.

11:53.543 --> 11:55.477
So I need you to take care
of this right away.

11:55.545 --> 11:57.679
Just replace the computer's
hard drive with a blank one

11:57.746 --> 11:58.813
when Ellie's not looking.

11:58.881 --> 12:00.548
She'll think
it just broke again.

12:00.616 --> 12:02.183
And-and I'll take care
of the rest.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.517
Bye.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.991
Director Bentley? Director
Bentley, I need to ask you,

12:10.059 --> 12:12.259
did you give the Orion
computer to my sister Ellie? No.

12:12.327 --> 12:14.661
Well, I don't mean to offend,
but I don't believe you.

12:14.729 --> 12:15.963
You shouldn't.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.297
I gave it to her.

12:17.364 --> 12:18.765
I knew it! I knew it,
I knew it.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.801
Okay, maybe you were unaware

12:20.868 --> 12:24.504
that I feel very strongly about
keeping my sister away from the CIA,

12:24.572 --> 12:26.272
but now that you know
that, I hope that

12:26.340 --> 12:28.108
you respect it,
because I'm in charge.

12:28.175 --> 12:30.009
The problem is,
I don't respect you.

12:30.077 --> 12:31.711
Hey, hey, you can resent
me all you want...

12:31.778 --> 12:34.246
whether you like it or not,
this is my project for a reason.

12:34.314 --> 12:36.181
I'm going to tell Brody
he's the new Intersect.

12:36.249 --> 12:39.018
A choice I feel very
confident...

12:40.087 --> 12:41.220
What the...?

12:41.287 --> 12:42.655
It's blood.

12:42.723 --> 12:44.590
Ew.

12:44.658 --> 12:46.424
And there's so much of it.

12:46.492 --> 12:48.727
It's coming from over there.

13:00.239 --> 13:03.306
Well, there goes
your first choice.

13:05.376 --> 13:06.510
Dear Lord!

13:06.577 --> 13:10.180
There's been a murder!

13:10.248 --> 13:15.786
So, Large Mart claims that this
kidnapping is in retaliation.

13:15.854 --> 13:19.388
See, I know no one here would
break a two-year prank detente

13:19.456 --> 13:22.025
with the Large Mart because,
I as your leader,

13:22.092 --> 13:23.993
have forbid it.

13:24.061 --> 13:26.228
Why? Because it's
just that important.

13:26.296 --> 13:27.496
But there you have it.

13:27.564 --> 13:30.066
They claim we kidnapped
Kevin Bacon.

13:32.136 --> 13:34.002
What did you two do?

13:35.171 --> 13:40.341
Oh, you put Kevin Bacon
in a closet?

13:44.080 --> 13:45.180
Really?

13:45.247 --> 13:46.782
Listen, we had to.

13:46.849 --> 13:48.183
Otherwise, they would
have dominated us

13:48.250 --> 13:50.151
just like always, right?

13:50.218 --> 13:51.552
'Cause weirdly, an
adorable little pig

13:51.619 --> 13:54.188
attracts more customers
than a large man

13:54.255 --> 13:55.690
wearing a big yellow
and green B.M.

13:55.757 --> 13:56.691
Call me crazy.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.093
Ah.

13:59.161 --> 14:00.161
Ah. Sweet.

14:00.228 --> 14:02.362
I'm buying whatever
he's selling.

14:04.766 --> 14:06.599
I can't believe he's dead.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.835
How could this happen
on my watch

14:08.903 --> 14:10.670
to my top recruit?
Who would do this?

14:10.738 --> 14:12.405
Well, nobody's been
in Castle for a week

14:12.472 --> 14:13.773
besides us, Bentley
and the recruits.

14:13.841 --> 14:16.242
That means the killer
is still among us.

14:16.310 --> 14:19.779
That's it, all of them.

14:19.847 --> 14:20.847
Uh-uh.

14:26.052 --> 14:28.420
And the
one in your skivvies, mate.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.794
It's like D and D
all over again.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.262
Okay, you are still in charge.

14:37.330 --> 14:38.763
You need to be calm
and confident.

14:38.797 --> 14:40.898
But just remember, we need
to figure this out, okay?

14:40.966 --> 14:42.566
Right.

14:42.634 --> 14:45.502
Calm... confident.

14:45.570 --> 14:47.939
Okay.

14:49.407 --> 14:52.476
Okay, here's the
situation, people.

14:52.544 --> 14:55.411
Castle is officially
in lockdown.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.148
Which means all cell phone
use is blocked.

14:58.216 --> 15:01.952
We will be going over all of the
surveillance footage and interrogating

15:02.019 --> 15:03.686
each and every one of you.

15:03.755 --> 15:05.688
Now, Casey, Sarah,
a little sidebar.

15:05.757 --> 15:07.157
Looks like some of us
are above suspicion.

15:07.225 --> 15:09.626
Yes. Why do they get
to keep their weapons?

15:09.693 --> 15:10.826
Yeah, who the hell are they?

15:10.894 --> 15:13.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, enough of that.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.030
Casey here has been
a part of Team Bartowski

15:15.098 --> 15:16.165
proudly, for years now,

15:16.233 --> 15:18.801
and has saved my life
countless times.

15:18.869 --> 15:20.169
Oh, I get it now.

15:20.237 --> 15:21.336
You're the Intersect's

15:21.404 --> 15:23.705
brainless heavy.

15:23.774 --> 15:26.474
Colonel Casey would
never kill anyone...

15:26.541 --> 15:28.977
who didn't deserve it.

15:29.044 --> 15:30.478
What about her?

15:30.545 --> 15:33.148
Uh, I think I can safely say
that my fiancee here

15:33.215 --> 15:34.548
would never kill anyone...

15:34.616 --> 15:36.350
who didn't deserve it.

15:36.418 --> 15:37.718
Your fiancee, huh?

15:37.787 --> 15:39.687
Now I see it.
What is that supposed to mean?

15:39.755 --> 15:41.122
Wait, ba-ba-ba-ba,
okay, okay.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.656
You go back over there.
You go back over there.

15:42.723 --> 15:44.057
You come over here.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.859
As I was saying,
it is not Casey,

15:45.927 --> 15:46.994
nor is it Sarah.

15:47.061 --> 15:49.897
So therefore, the killer
must be one of you.

15:57.138 --> 16:01.340
Right. Let's blame
the swarthy, bearded guy.

16:01.408 --> 16:02.374
No, no.

16:02.442 --> 16:03.676
I have lots of friends

16:03.743 --> 16:04.844
who are terrorists.

16:04.912 --> 16:06.679
This is just what
my face looks like!

16:06.746 --> 16:08.347
I didn't spend
the last ten years

16:08.415 --> 16:09.816
in a cave for my country

16:09.883 --> 16:11.483
to have to deal with this.

16:11.551 --> 16:13.019
I'm totally out of here.

16:13.086 --> 16:15.887
Oh, and by the way, I'm Greek.

16:15.955 --> 16:17.122
Greek? I wouldn't
have guessed that.

16:17.190 --> 16:18.156
Damian, wait!

16:18.224 --> 16:19.891
Don't shoot anyone, Casey.

16:19.959 --> 16:20.991
Damian, wait.

16:21.059 --> 16:22.359
Wait.

16:22.427 --> 16:24.795
Damian, halt.
Please halt.

16:24.863 --> 16:26.596
No, just, no! Please,
just... I'm leaving now.

16:26.664 --> 16:27.832
Damian...

16:30.001 --> 16:31.001
Damian, no!

16:47.111 --> 16:48.544
Just get me out h here.

16:48.612 --> 16:50.013
'He's losing a lot of blood.

16:50.081 --> 16:51.348
I need a doctor!

16:51.415 --> 16:52.582
I'm grabbing some bandages.

16:52.649 --> 16:54.050
Let's just put some pressure
on the wou..

16:57.088 --> 16:59.121
Sarah, everything is off-line.

16:59.189 --> 17:00.555
We can't access the surveillance
videos anymore,

17:00.623 --> 17:03.993
and all communication channels
with CIA are dark.

17:05.328 --> 17:08.463
Good job getting the
emergency lights back up.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.464
The bomb was linked
to the three others.

17:10.532 --> 17:11.767
The main power grid is out.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.335
Since the doors were
already on lockdown,

17:13.403 --> 17:15.970
we're in here without any
support. We're trapped?

17:16.038 --> 17:17.204
This is not going well.

17:17.272 --> 17:19.273
Listen to me, Chuck,
the most important thing

17:19.340 --> 17:21.041
about leadership
is to convince everybody

17:21.109 --> 17:22.710
that you have everything
under control.

17:22.778 --> 17:24.578
What if instead Casey
was in charge, yeah?

17:24.646 --> 17:26.614
Or maybe you could be in charge.
It doesn't work like that.

17:26.681 --> 17:27.982
I had my shot.

17:28.050 --> 17:29.617
Almost nuked the Inland Empire.

17:29.684 --> 17:31.651
These people have been following
you for a week.

17:31.719 --> 17:33.287
Chuck, look, you're not
in charge by accident.

17:33.354 --> 17:35.422
You did disarm a nuclear bomb
containing fruit juice.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.957
Okay, you can do this.

17:37.025 --> 17:38.225
We're right behind you.

17:38.293 --> 17:40.794
Thanks.

17:40.861 --> 17:43.863
Okay, so... so
here's the thing.

17:43.932 --> 17:47.133
We are officially checked in,
now, with a killer,

17:47.200 --> 17:50.102
but not to worry... I have
everything under control.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.406
I feel calm.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.108
Bloody hell,
we're sitting here disarmed

17:56.176 --> 17:57.843
and the meat head
has all the guns.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.245
Casey, listen,

17:59.313 --> 18:01.547
you need to swallow this, okay?
What's most important now

18:01.614 --> 18:04.950
is to support Chuck. He needs
to look like the boss. Fine.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.452
I still don't trust
an American operative

18:07.519 --> 18:08.753
with a British accent.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.422
Well, it's not my fault.

18:10.489 --> 18:12.623
It's from my semester abroad.

18:12.691 --> 18:17.628
Wait, one semester? You got an
accent from four months in England?

18:17.696 --> 18:20.397
Yeah, that's really
annoying, dude.

18:20.465 --> 18:22.899
Well, it's not that bad.

18:22.968 --> 18:25.269
First off, I'd like to thank

18:25.337 --> 18:27.137
all of the Large Mart
representatives for coming.

18:27.205 --> 18:28.839
Sincerely, I cannot apologize
enough...

18:28.906 --> 18:32.776
Just give us Kevin Bacon,
and peace can be restored.

18:32.844 --> 18:34.810
Fine. Fine.

18:34.878 --> 18:37.847
I would like proof of life.

18:37.914 --> 18:40.116
See, you have a certain
human being of ours,

18:40.184 --> 18:43.319
and, uh, I'd like
to speak with him.

18:48.392 --> 18:49.925
You won't be able
to track the signal,

18:49.993 --> 18:52.060
so don't bother.

18:56.799 --> 18:58.166
Big Mike? Hello, son.

18:58.234 --> 18:59.468
Thank God.

18:59.535 --> 19:01.436
Big Mike, it's so good
to hear your voice.

19:01.504 --> 19:04.006
I was sick. I can't go a whole
day without my number two.

19:04.073 --> 19:05.640
How are you doing?
I'm fine.

19:05.708 --> 19:08.309
Whatever you do, don't give in
to Large Mart's demands.

19:08.377 --> 19:10.544
Of course I'm going to give in
to their demands.

19:10.612 --> 19:12.046
I got to get you out of there,
okay?

19:12.114 --> 19:13.547
Do you want me just
to call the police?

19:13.615 --> 19:15.782
Uh, the police have
no jurisdiction here.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.718
This isn't anything
that can't be handled

19:17.785 --> 19:19.387
within the confines
of the shopping center.

19:19.454 --> 19:21.855
And anyway, I'm having
a nice time.

19:21.923 --> 19:24.690
They brought in Subway
flat bread breakfast sandwiches.

19:24.758 --> 19:28.028
The steak, egg and cheese ones?
With chipotle southwest sauce.

19:28.095 --> 19:30.163
It reminds me of your mama.

19:30.231 --> 19:32.732
<i>Muy caliente.
I've heard enough.</i>

19:32.799 --> 19:34.967
He has heard enough.

19:35.036 --> 19:37.137
Okay, Marvin, here we are.

19:37.204 --> 19:39.304
Take your pig and...

19:42.909 --> 19:44.243
This some kind of joke?

19:44.310 --> 19:47.413
Where is Kevin Bacon?

19:47.480 --> 19:49.548
I don't...
I don't know.

19:49.615 --> 19:52.217
Okay, Marvin, you have my word.

19:52.285 --> 19:53.952
I will get to
the bottom of this.

19:54.020 --> 19:57.321
But you need to give me till
midnight, and I will find your pig.

19:57.389 --> 20:00.824
Yeah, well, if you don't, I can't
promise your friend's safety.

20:00.892 --> 20:02.226
But I can promise you this...

20:02.294 --> 20:04.929
a big flaming B.M.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.365
on your doorstep.

20:11.502 --> 20:12.936
Devon, I had a breakthrough.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.272
What's going on?

20:15.339 --> 20:17.907
Well, I had an epiphany between
baby yoga and music.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.277
I was trying to figure out
how my dad's research

20:20.344 --> 20:21.778
added up,

20:21.845 --> 20:23.613
and then I thought about Clara,

20:23.681 --> 20:26.049
and about how she's
learning stuff so fast.

20:26.116 --> 20:28.784
My dad was trying
to figure out a way

20:28.851 --> 20:32.288
to input knowledge into the human
brain without having to learn it.

20:32.355 --> 20:33.755
Wow.
Yeah.

20:33.823 --> 20:35.891
I mean, think about
the implications, Devon.

20:35.959 --> 20:37.926
He left that knowledge
for me for a reason,

20:37.994 --> 20:39.928
and I... and I figured
it out, but why?

20:39.996 --> 20:41.397
I just... I don't know

20:41.465 --> 20:43.164
what he wanted me
to do with it.

20:45.801 --> 20:47.202
I just wish...

20:47.269 --> 20:49.770
I wish he was here.

20:52.007 --> 20:54.342
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:54.410 --> 20:56.077
We do.

21:07.088 --> 21:09.723
So, Director,

21:09.790 --> 21:12.626
the way I see it, you've got
more motive than anyone.

21:12.693 --> 21:14.227
You hate that I'm in charge.

21:14.294 --> 21:15.961
You want my program to fail.

21:16.029 --> 21:18.897
And you've said very mean things
to me all day.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.399
I would never do
anything like this.

21:20.467 --> 21:21.967
Oh, wouldn't you?

21:22.035 --> 21:24.370
I mean, you've already
gone after my sister,

21:24.438 --> 21:26.305
so clearly you are willing
to do anything

21:26.373 --> 21:27.440
to benefit your own project.

21:27.508 --> 21:29.308
Including murder.

21:29.376 --> 21:31.476
And you're the only one
who knew that Brody

21:31.544 --> 21:33.612
was my first choice.
Brody made you light up

21:33.679 --> 21:35.580
like a 13-year-old girl.

21:35.648 --> 21:38.183
Everyone knew
he was your first choice.

21:38.251 --> 21:41.186
What? Really?

21:41.254 --> 21:43.721
I don't know what else you want
me to say.

21:43.789 --> 21:45.157
I didn't do it!

21:45.224 --> 21:46.690
I'm not buying this

21:46.758 --> 21:48.692
whole weepy thing.
It doesn't fit your profile.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.495
You're not the only one who's
trained in psy-ops, you know.

21:51.563 --> 21:53.864
You've been hiding
something from us all week

21:53.931 --> 21:55.366
and you've been
highly emotional.

21:55.433 --> 21:59.002
For your information,
I'm emotional because

21:59.070 --> 22:02.139
I got dumped last week by
my boyfriend for being...

22:02.206 --> 22:05.408
too emotional!

22:11.382 --> 22:13.916
Look, I don't do
too well with girls and crying.

22:13.984 --> 22:15.185
You know what I mean?

22:15.252 --> 22:17.220
Maybe we should be
a little easier on her.

22:17.288 --> 22:18.787
She's trained
to do this, Chuck.

22:18.854 --> 22:20.121
Do not let her manipulate you.

22:22.858 --> 22:24.626
Okay, fine, I won't, I won't.

22:24.694 --> 22:26.328
This is torture!

22:26.396 --> 22:27.696
You're torturing me!

22:27.763 --> 22:29.231
No, we're not!
No, we're not torturing you!

22:29.299 --> 22:30.465
There's no torture going on
in here!

22:30.533 --> 22:32.867
Although there is
no clear definition.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.402
Sarah...

22:34.469 --> 22:36.571
Look, we're gonna get you some
more painkillers very soon.

22:36.638 --> 22:39.073
But first, you're gonna answer a
few more questions, okay?

22:39.140 --> 22:42.576
For example, why is your bag
covered in sand, huh?

22:42.643 --> 22:45.178
Which happens to be
a great way to throw off

22:45.246 --> 22:47.146
our X-ray equipment.
Mighty convenient.

22:47.215 --> 22:50.817
Or it's because everything
I have is covered in sand!

22:50.884 --> 22:52.919
Because the CIA
won't send me anywhere

22:52.986 --> 22:55.054
<i>where there isn't any sand!</i>

22:59.259 --> 23:02.761
Old school. I like it.

23:02.829 --> 23:03.995
It doesn't even work...

23:04.063 --> 23:06.398
because there's sand in it.

23:08.468 --> 23:10.936
Lewis, my tech guy...

23:11.003 --> 23:15.039
and suspiciously,
an elite bomb specialist.

23:15.107 --> 23:17.074
You knew I had
high hopes for you.

23:17.142 --> 23:18.909
Maybe that was your motivation.

23:18.977 --> 23:20.845
I mean, you knew that Brody was
my first choice

23:20.912 --> 23:22.179
and that you were my second.

23:22.248 --> 23:24.749
No, I didn't know that,
but thanks for not choosing me.

23:24.816 --> 23:27.752
You didn't, you
didn't know that?

23:27.819 --> 23:31.154
Oh, looky what we have here!

23:31.222 --> 23:34.190
Sharp! Can you explain this?

23:34.259 --> 23:36.126
Uh, it's my knife.

23:36.193 --> 23:38.362
Yes, but why do you have a knife

23:38.429 --> 23:41.798
used by an IRA bomb maker in
your bag?

23:41.866 --> 23:43.967
Because I killed
an IRA bomb maker

23:44.034 --> 23:45.901
and I took it from him.

23:46.718 --> 23:50.373
Walker, Bartowski, you figure
out who the killer is yet?

23:50.440 --> 23:52.575
No luck.
It could be any one of them.

23:52.643 --> 23:55.043
All we know is that whoever
the killer is,

23:55.111 --> 23:56.712
they were sitting in that chair.

23:59.015 --> 24:00.750
I'm not even sure
that we know that much.

24:02.652 --> 24:04.586
Actually, Sarah,

24:04.654 --> 24:06.655
I'm pretty certain,
as there is a bomb

24:06.722 --> 24:08.423
strapped to the
bottom of the chair.

24:08.491 --> 24:10.392
We gotta go right now!

24:22.304 --> 24:24.037
Did you feel that?

24:24.105 --> 24:27.274
I haven't felt
anything for years.

24:33.114 --> 24:34.847
What's happening?

24:34.915 --> 24:37.817
My ears are ringing!
I can't hear anything!

24:37.884 --> 24:39.519
Are you okay?

24:43.924 --> 24:45.792
Walker, glad
you're still alive.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.260
Yeah, I'm good, too.
Thanks, buddy.

24:50.095 --> 24:51.363
Damian caught another piece
of shrapnel,

24:51.431 --> 24:52.698
this time in the back.

24:52.765 --> 24:55.266
Oh, my God, we gotta
get him to a doctor!

24:55.335 --> 24:56.267
We will.

24:56.336 --> 24:57.703
Unless we die here.

24:57.770 --> 24:59.270
Then he'll have to wait.

24:59.339 --> 25:01.039
Everyone's here except Lewis.

25:01.106 --> 25:03.342
Yeah, of course,
the bomb expert.

25:03.409 --> 25:06.677
He must have set up the bomb so
he could get away, which means...

25:06.745 --> 25:08.679
Lewis is the killer.

25:08.747 --> 25:09.814
Seriously?

25:09.881 --> 25:11.659
He was my second choice.

25:12.551 --> 25:15.782
This is not just Car BM
we're talking about here.

25:15.783 --> 25:18.132
This is our Big Mike.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.102
He's in real danger here,
fellas. Real danger.

25:21.169 --> 25:22.937
Think about it:
what if these men were

25:23.004 --> 25:24.671
to take away
his sandwiches, hmm?

25:24.739 --> 25:26.740
He is not built for that.

25:26.807 --> 25:29.243
So I have to ask you one more
time, okay:

25:29.310 --> 25:31.311
Where is Kevin Bacon?

25:34.048 --> 25:36.182
I don't know what to say,
my friend. It's a...

25:36.251 --> 25:38.252
it's a mystery.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.053
It's an unsolvable mystery.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.920
It is not a mystery! In fact,

25:41.988 --> 25:43.356
it is quite obvious
what has happened.

25:43.423 --> 25:47.926
You stole Kevin Bacon, and
therefore you two hid him, hmm?

25:49.162 --> 25:52.465
Or...

25:52.532 --> 25:54.567
did we?

26:02.908 --> 26:07.145
Okay, Damian's unconscious, but
he's still alive, for now.

26:10.015 --> 26:13.517
Look, the good news is we can

26:13.585 --> 26:14.685
trust each other again.

26:14.753 --> 26:16.787
Lewis is clearly the one
who planted the bombs

26:16.854 --> 26:19.657
and killed Brody, who probably
caught him in the process.

26:19.724 --> 26:21.659
Brody!

26:26.431 --> 26:28.765
We're gonna need
all hands on deck.

26:28.832 --> 26:31.033
Lewis is in Castle
with nowhere to go.

26:31.101 --> 26:32.635
That guy can build
a bomb out of anything.

26:32.703 --> 26:34.537
Watch for trip wires,
booby-traps.

26:34.605 --> 26:35.938
Yeah, also remember
it's important

26:36.006 --> 26:37.173
that we capture this guy alive.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.108
Okay? We need to find out
who he's working for.

26:39.176 --> 26:41.010
Why he would have
sabotaged Castle.

26:41.077 --> 26:44.379
<i>You just gonna stand around
and talk about it, leader?</i>

26:44.447 --> 26:47.582
No, I'm gonna find Lewis and I'm
gonna take that bastard down.

26:54.890 --> 26:57.258
Listen, Director, I just wanted
to apologize

26:57.327 --> 26:58.460
for accusing you of murder.

26:58.528 --> 27:00.761
And if you promise to stay away
from my sister,

27:00.829 --> 27:02.463
I think we can get past it.

27:02.531 --> 27:03.564
Maybe even become friends.

27:03.632 --> 27:05.032
Do you know
what your problem is?

27:05.099 --> 27:06.834
You want people
to like you too much.

27:06.901 --> 27:08.235
A good leader shouldn't care
about that.

27:08.303 --> 27:09.603
Sector Two clear.

27:09.671 --> 27:12.840
You don't understand,
six years we were together.

27:12.907 --> 27:16.310
I mean, how did you get
the Intersect to commit?

27:16.377 --> 27:18.077
Sector One clear.

27:18.145 --> 27:20.680
Clearly, you feel that way,

27:20.748 --> 27:23.883
as you haven't made even the
slightest of attempts to be liked.

27:23.951 --> 27:25.885
That's not important to me.

27:25.953 --> 27:28.020
Really? Not even a little bit?
What, are you made of stone?

27:28.088 --> 27:30.824
Shh!
Did you hear that?

27:33.092 --> 27:35.794
Guys, I hear movement in
the ducts.

27:39.966 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, I hear it too,
Chuck. It's Lewis.

27:44.270 --> 27:46.605
Crap. I lost him.

27:46.673 --> 27:47.906
Casey, you got anything?

27:53.111 --> 27:54.879
I'm right underneath him.

27:58.417 --> 28:01.586
Freeze, Limey, if you want
to keep your balls.

28:10.428 --> 28:11.361
What the hell?

28:11.429 --> 28:12.696
What is it?

28:15.666 --> 28:17.768
It's a pig.

28:20.570 --> 28:22.605
A pig?

28:25.909 --> 28:28.744
You hid Kevin Bacon in
the air ducts?

28:28.812 --> 28:32.114
If you love something,
let it go.

28:32.181 --> 28:35.017
If it comes back,
you can eat it.

28:35.084 --> 28:37.351
He lives by a strange

28:37.420 --> 28:39.353
philosophy of karma and diet.

28:39.422 --> 28:41.456
It combines the two.

28:41.524 --> 28:43.324
But it works for him.

28:43.392 --> 28:45.059
A pig? Did he
really just say...?

28:45.127 --> 28:47.028
That means Lewis is
still out there.

28:47.095 --> 28:49.497
And all I've got is you.
Whoa! Where you going?

28:49.565 --> 28:51.265
I'm going to the
Intersect room.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.467
It's bombproof and it's
the safest place in Castle.

28:53.535 --> 28:54.968
Don't you...?

28:57.839 --> 29:00.574
Director, stop!
I command you!

29:03.878 --> 29:05.813
Hey, hey! I don't
wanna pull rank here,

29:05.880 --> 29:08.348
but you can't just walk away
from me like that.

29:08.416 --> 29:09.715
Ooh, you don't want
to pull rank

29:09.783 --> 29:11.016
'cause I may not like you?

29:13.286 --> 29:14.887
What is that?

29:14.955 --> 29:17.122
That is none of your concern.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.791
It is absolutely my concern.

29:18.859 --> 29:21.193
It's my father's research.
It's government property!

29:21.261 --> 29:22.862
It's my sister using the computer...!
It's a matter of national security!

29:22.930 --> 29:24.963
National security?! You're
putting my family in danger!

29:25.030 --> 29:28.500
I am protecting my country and
saving my project from you!

29:29.969 --> 29:30.869
Do you see him?

29:33.638 --> 29:34.839
I see him.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.006
Mm-hmm.

29:38.810 --> 29:40.177
We got you, Lewis.

29:40.244 --> 29:41.846
There's nowhere left to go.

29:55.392 --> 29:59.462
I think we can safely say
that Lewis is not the killer.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.805
Brilliant deduction, Sherlock.

30:01.992 --> 30:04.844
It was bad. I mean I've seen bad,
but this was grizzly.

30:04.964 --> 30:07.327
That means the killer's
still out there.

30:07.394 --> 30:09.296
Leaves just the ladies.
Figures.

30:09.363 --> 30:11.731
All right, let's finish this.

30:13.034 --> 30:14.567
It's not me, so that leaves you.

30:14.635 --> 30:16.002
My sentiments exactly.

30:16.070 --> 30:18.305
All right, everybody shut up
and put your weapons down.

30:18.372 --> 30:20.473
Unless it's one of them.

30:20.541 --> 30:22.741
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Drop your guns.

30:22.809 --> 30:26.946
You drop your guns!
I want this to be over!

30:27.013 --> 30:29.748
This is a mess.
Okay, leader, whatcha got?

30:29.816 --> 30:31.717
Who's the killer?

30:39.158 --> 30:40.725
There's been a murder!

30:49.434 --> 30:51.002
I know who did it.

30:51.070 --> 30:52.003
What?

30:54.005 --> 30:56.539
At first, I thought Brody's
killer had to be Lewis,

30:56.607 --> 30:59.343
since it made sense that my second
choice would want to kill my first choice.

30:59.410 --> 31:02.645
So I'm not your first or second
choice. That's good to know.

31:02.713 --> 31:05.349
No, no, no, no, no, no, look,
look, I loved all of you guys.

31:05.416 --> 31:08.051
Really. It's just that there
can only be one number one

31:08.119 --> 31:10.719
and one number two,
but they're both dead now.

31:10.787 --> 31:13.722
And if it makes you feel any
better, I did suspect you

31:13.790 --> 31:15.724
of being the killer
for a little while,

31:15.792 --> 31:16.725
mainly because of your...

31:16.793 --> 31:18.294
<i>volatile emotional state.</i>

31:20.864 --> 31:22.198
Sorry.

31:22.266 --> 31:24.633
But you're not a murderer.

31:24.701 --> 31:27.402
While going through your things,
I found the pregnancy stick.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.337
You're expecting.

31:29.405 --> 31:30.972
Congratulations. I hope
you're blessed with a boy.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.442
So, which brings me to
where my suspicions have

31:34.510 --> 31:36.044
been pointing the entire time.

31:36.112 --> 31:37.478
You must be joking.

31:41.649 --> 31:45.119
Only one person was
unaccounted for during Brody's

31:45.186 --> 31:46.653
and Lewis's murders...

31:46.721 --> 31:49.223
My opinion is
you're going to screw it up.

31:51.592 --> 31:56.096
<i>...and who has unique access
to Castle's infrastructure.</i>

32:00.334 --> 32:01.867
I'd be very careful.

32:04.571 --> 32:06.839
I know it isn't you.

32:06.907 --> 32:07.840
What?

32:07.908 --> 32:09.108
She had ample opportunity

32:09.176 --> 32:11.010
to kill me, and she
didn't take it, okay?

32:11.078 --> 32:12.711
I just wanted everyone on
this side of the room

32:12.779 --> 32:14.913
so I could quietly tell you:

32:14.981 --> 32:17.549
it's Damien.

32:17.616 --> 32:21.586
He's the killer,
and he's probably armed.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.757
Let's do it.

32:25.825 --> 32:27.292
I'll flank him on the left.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.360
I got your right.

32:28.428 --> 32:31.128
I got your back, Chuck.

32:31.196 --> 32:33.597
How about we
go with Plan "B", Chuck?

32:39.938 --> 32:42.606
You're going to
let me out of here.

32:42.674 --> 32:44.508
You're going to get me
to a doctor, or...

32:46.844 --> 32:48.911
...I'm going to blow us all up.

32:48.980 --> 32:50.913
The boombox? Really?

32:50.982 --> 32:52.748
I- I guess actually
I should've expected that.

32:52.816 --> 32:54.717
Look, be rational, okay?
You want to get out of here

32:54.785 --> 32:55.986
just as much as we do.

32:56.053 --> 32:57.620
<i>How do you know what I want?</i>

32:57.688 --> 32:59.122
I wasn't even
one of your choices.

33:00.858 --> 33:02.124
'Cause you don't want to die.

33:02.192 --> 33:04.026
You've wanted out
of here all along.

33:06.796 --> 33:10.499
Brody caught you planting
the explosives in Castle.

33:10.566 --> 33:12.368
What are you doing?

33:12.435 --> 33:14.769
<i>That's why you killed
him, and had to cover your tracks.</i>

33:16.706 --> 33:18.306
But when we locked
this place down,

33:18.374 --> 33:20.108
you knew it was only
a matter of time

33:20.175 --> 33:21.675
before we knew that
you were the killer.

33:21.743 --> 33:23.411
And that's when you
really committed.

33:23.479 --> 33:24.912
By blowing yourself up.

33:27.049 --> 33:29.283
<i>Knowing where the
explosives were placed,</i>

33:29.351 --> 33:32.420
<i>you used the door to shield
yourself from the blast.</i>

33:32.488 --> 33:34.821
Bold move.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.156
I had no choice.

33:36.224 --> 33:37.924
But the bombs
locked all the doors.

33:37.992 --> 33:39.259
So you tried a new method.

33:39.327 --> 33:40.494
Thinking that if we had

33:40.561 --> 33:43.763
a killer in mind,
we'd get you out. So,

33:43.831 --> 33:45.165
you planted a bomb
under your chair,

33:45.233 --> 33:46.166
during your interrogation.

33:46.234 --> 33:50.036
Ah! This is torture!

33:50.103 --> 33:51.537
You're torturing me!

33:51.604 --> 33:53.906
When the bomb went off,
you used the chaos as cover

33:53.973 --> 33:55.274
to kill and hide Lewis.

33:55.342 --> 33:58.010
But unfortunately
for you, we found him.

33:58.078 --> 34:00.913
<i>So now we know what happened,
but we don't know why.</i>

34:00.980 --> 34:02.181
Who are you working
for, Damian?

34:02.249 --> 34:04.183
What are they after?

34:05.851 --> 34:07.118
I came here for you, Chuck.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.692
Now, you're going to
get me out of here.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.194
Chuck...

34:16.262 --> 34:19.097
You know what you have to do.

34:19.165 --> 34:20.764
We can't let you leave.

34:20.831 --> 34:21.998
You know that.

34:23.368 --> 34:24.701
So just put the bomb down.

34:24.768 --> 34:26.570
No, thanks.

34:26.637 --> 34:27.670
It's your choice, boss.

34:39.116 --> 34:41.583
Sarah, the bomb's
been activated.

34:41.650 --> 34:43.085
It's okay, Chuck,
you can do this.

34:43.152 --> 34:45.521
I can, normally, yes, but not
this fast. There are so many

34:45.589 --> 34:47.623
security measures, I just can't
defuse it in that amount of time.

34:47.690 --> 34:50.560
Chuck, keep everybody as far
away from the Intersect room

34:50.627 --> 34:51.994
as possible.
No, Bentley!

34:52.062 --> 34:53.027
Bentley!

34:53.096 --> 34:54.563
What are you doing?

34:54.630 --> 34:55.996
The Intersect room
is the only room

34:56.065 --> 34:57.265
that can contain this blast.

34:57.333 --> 34:58.700
The power's out,
the doors won't shut!

34:58.767 --> 35:00.235
There's a manual release.

35:00.303 --> 35:02.404
No. No, no, no, no,
there's got to be another way.

35:03.639 --> 35:06.040
This is what a leader does.

35:10.745 --> 35:13.780
Hey.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.433
I hotwired the control panel,
using my stupid

35:34.501 --> 35:36.502
pocket protector,
thank you very much.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.869
Okay, come on.
We don't have time.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.592
Oh!

36:07.778 --> 36:10.293
Congratulations on solving
the murder mystery

36:10.413 --> 36:12.243
and for saving Castle
from destruction.

36:12.363 --> 36:14.676
And a special commendation
to you, Chuck.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.282
You were a true leader.

36:16.349 --> 36:17.716
Thank you, General.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.485
But I'm only as strong as
the team that surrounds me,

36:20.553 --> 36:22.220
and, as always,

36:22.288 --> 36:25.056
Sarah and Casey were my
eyes, ears, and more today.

36:25.124 --> 36:26.390
I'm glad you feel that way,

36:26.458 --> 36:28.294
because this is the team
we're sticking with.

36:28.514 --> 36:31.529
Following the security breach,
it has been deemed too dangerous

36:31.596 --> 36:33.564
to put the Intersect
into a new recruit.

36:33.684 --> 36:35.733
At least for the
foreseeable future, Chuck,

36:35.801 --> 36:38.368
you are to remain
the only Intersect.

36:38.436 --> 36:40.904
Director Bentley, you will
await reassignment

36:40.972 --> 36:42.372
in Washington.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.640
General, if I could just

36:43.708 --> 36:45.608
add something quickly.

36:45.676 --> 36:48.445
Director Bentley was
invaluable today.

36:48.512 --> 36:50.314
Noted.

36:50.381 --> 36:52.482
Well done, team.

36:55.518 --> 36:58.587
So this is it, huh?

36:58.655 --> 37:00.923
You're a good spy,
Chuck Bartowski.

37:00.991 --> 37:03.860
I'm sorry for
underestimating you.

37:03.927 --> 37:05.862
Thank you.

37:05.929 --> 37:08.130
It's good to not have
a nemesis anymore.

37:11.334 --> 37:13.701
You know...

37:13.769 --> 37:16.204
your sister is incredibly smart.

37:16.272 --> 37:18.874
If anybody can figure out
the Intersect, it's her.

37:18.941 --> 37:21.309
You might want to reconsider
keeping her away from her path.

37:27.682 --> 37:30.384
We are not going to let Big Mike
just sit there and rot.

37:30.451 --> 37:32.987
No! Who knows
what those Large Mart heathens

37:33.054 --> 37:35.222
could be doing to him? So I'll
tell you what we're going to do.

37:35.290 --> 37:37.024
We're going to break him out.

37:37.092 --> 37:38.192
- Yeah!
- Let's do this.

37:38.260 --> 37:39.860
Look! He's alive!

38:06.652 --> 38:09.221
It was easy, they had
a couple of nerds watching me.

38:09.289 --> 38:10.923
My shift was over.

38:10.990 --> 38:12.090
I ain't staying late!

38:13.293 --> 38:14.325
I'm glad you're okay.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.260
Yeah, we're all glad.

38:16.328 --> 38:19.063
We're all glad you're okay.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.106
Large Mart rules!

38:29.174 --> 38:31.074
Our B.M.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.843
It's okay, son.

38:33.911 --> 38:36.679
It was worth it to have
some Large Mart fun again.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.681
We can make another B.M.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.621
Hey.
Is this a Large Mart pig?

38:45.689 --> 38:47.556
Yeah, of course it is.

38:47.623 --> 38:49.425
Oh, hey.

38:49.492 --> 38:50.859
Let me guess.

38:50.927 --> 38:52.794
Jeff and Lester stole
the porcine victim,

38:52.862 --> 38:55.197
Large Mart snatched
Big Mike in retaliation,

38:55.265 --> 38:57.632
he was able to liberate himself,
but they still torched

38:57.700 --> 39:00.069
the big B.M. on your doorstep.

39:00.136 --> 39:01.803
You, you left out, uh...

39:01.871 --> 39:03.137
nothing, no, that's right,

39:03.205 --> 39:04.605
that's exactly right.
I figured as much.

39:04.673 --> 39:06.207
Yeah, pretty much.
What happened to you?

39:06.275 --> 39:07.208
It's been a long day.

39:07.276 --> 39:09.077
Yeah.
To say the least, yeah.

39:09.144 --> 39:11.346
I'll just leave it at that. Here
you go, here's Kevin Bacon.

39:11.413 --> 39:13.348
Oh, come on, buddy.
Come on... Oh, hey.

39:13.415 --> 39:15.816
He also ate a lot,
so... just...

39:15.884 --> 39:18.452
Oh! No, no, that's good,
I could kinda...

39:18.519 --> 39:20.020
Oh, God...

39:20.088 --> 39:22.289
Oh, no... No!

39:37.170 --> 39:38.104
Hey.

39:38.171 --> 39:40.406
Hey.

39:40.474 --> 39:42.274
So I took care of
things on my end.

39:42.342 --> 39:43.942
Ellie won't be bothered again.

39:44.011 --> 39:45.344
How's everything going here?

39:45.412 --> 39:47.480
It's done.

39:47.547 --> 39:49.515
The computer's taken care of?

39:49.582 --> 39:51.149
Kaput.

39:56.355 --> 39:58.757
It's for the best.

40:02.495 --> 40:04.930
Right?

40:04.998 --> 40:07.899
Totally. Yeah.

40:20.512 --> 40:24.581
So... we're still not
telling Chuck, right?

40:24.649 --> 40:26.983
No. We don't want
him to worry.

40:30.922 --> 40:32.522
Well, guys...

40:32.590 --> 40:34.991
I want to apologize for all
the grief you had to swallow

40:35.059 --> 40:36.459
to support me.

40:36.527 --> 40:37.661
Chuck, that's not necessary.

40:37.728 --> 40:39.361
I think it is,
though. I... I do.

40:39.429 --> 40:42.031
I would've fallen apart today if
it weren't for the two of you.

40:42.098 --> 40:45.467
It's not just
the computer, or the man.

40:45.535 --> 40:47.269
The Intersect is all of us.

40:47.336 --> 40:49.337
It's the three of us,
working together.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.339
That's why it works.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.842
Don't ever forget that.

40:56.244 --> 40:57.579
Good. You're all here.

40:57.646 --> 40:59.847
I wanted to get in touch
with you right away.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.115
We've interrogated Damian,

41:01.183 --> 41:02.584
and he wasn't trying
to obtain the Intersect.

41:02.651 --> 41:05.053
He was simply hired
to bomb Castle.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.988
Have we figured out
who he was working for?

41:07.056 --> 41:09.724
It turns out Damian
was wired $10 million

41:09.792 --> 41:11.524
by none other than Vivian Volkoff.

41:11.593 --> 41:15.095
It appears she's going after the
an who took down her father.

41:15.162 --> 41:18.098
Wait! Wait, wait, Vivian Volkoff
is trying to kill me?

41:18.165 --> 41:21.134
Your team will be contacted
should any more information

41:21.202 --> 41:25.371
surface. For now,
remain on high alert.

41:29.776 --> 41:31.443
I'm someone's nemesis?

41:31.511 --> 41:34.903
For real, this time.
