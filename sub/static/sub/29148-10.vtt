How about we just buy each other
lumps of coal this year and call it a day?

00:19.728 --> 00:21.730
Sure.
Just as long as it’s under ten dollars,

00:21.813 --> 00:23.815

-You haven’t washed your hair all week?
-Of course I have.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.497
It’s more of a sense memory,
from the trauma.

-Yeah, that's hard to get out.
-Know what I want for Christmas?

I hope your Secret Santa gets you... that.

It sounds like the only good thing
about that night

02:35.488 --> 02:37.490
He keeps asking
all these personal questions.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.325
I think he’s just stalling for time,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.494
so he can try to squeeze me
for more money.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.497
Hmm. Maybe he’s hesitating
'cause he knows you’re underbidding.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.917

-Says me, Tex.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.295

not my partner.

would've been unbearable without you.

that my work can get ugly and ruthless.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.319
What is wrong with you?
You didn't hear me yelling your name?

37:18.402 --> 37:22.031
-No. What's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong. It's... [stammers]

37:22.114 --> 37:24.617
B-Bash is buying a TV network,
and I'm gonna be the president.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.119
And we're gonna program
a new wrestling show

37:27.203 --> 37:29.622
with new characters because,
you know, we...

37:29.705 --> 37:33.167
we have no legal rights to the old ones.
[stammering] And-- And-- And I want...

37:33.334 --> 37:34.585
you to direct it.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.170
Debbie,

37:36.963 --> 37:39.382
-[laughing] how did you--
-[Debbie] Tex had a deal,

37:39.465 --> 37:43.261
and I fucking stole it. [laughs]
And I brought it to Bash, and it worked.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.762
I mean, it fucking worked.

37:44.845 --> 37:47.723
And I...
I-- I'm going to build us an Eden.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.268
Where we run the show. You and me.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.437
No more auditions, no more being
at the mercy of these fucking idiots.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.647
We’ll call the shots.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.484
-[chuckles]
-And... you want me to... direct?

37:58.818 --> 38:01.737
If being an actor was gonna happen
for you, it would've happened by now.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.572
How many times are you gonna break
your own heart?

38:04.532 --> 38:06.200
You don't have to stay in Vegas.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.245
You don't have to keep auditioning
for people who don't... want you.

38:09.328 --> 38:12.373
Because I found us an off-ramp
that's also...

38:12.456 --> 38:14.709
God, it's a fucking catapult
into our future!

38:15.084 --> 38:18.337
So I wanted to just tell you that.
And that...

38:20.965 --> 38:22.758
And Merry Christmas. [sighs]

38:29.598 --> 38:32.059
That’s <i>your </i>catapult.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.769
Not mine.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.189
[sighs] Oh, Jesus. Just say thank you.

38:38.774 --> 38:41.569
I don’t want what you want.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.947
You don’t want to be happy?

38:45.448 --> 38:47.241
Successful? Uh, powerful?

38:48.242 --> 38:50.953
I don’t want an off-ramp.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.456
I never even got on the road.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.377
So, what are you gonna do? You're gonna...
[scoffs] ...read plays with Sheila?

38:58.461 --> 39:01.213
Come on, Ruth. Make a move!

39:01.964 --> 39:02.840
[woman] Ma’am?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.967
Excuse me, are you boarding this flight?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.303
Sorry, we're just
in the middle of something.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.431
[flight attendant]
We’ll be closing the door to the Jetway.

39:10.598 --> 39:11.474
I’m coming.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.935
What are you... I don't understand you.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.646
Yes, you do.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.649
Probably better than anyone.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.449
