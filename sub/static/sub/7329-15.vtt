WEBVTT

00:37.794 --> 00:40.630
Oh, man, my head.

00:48.939 --> 00:50.883
Heatherton.

00:50.907 --> 00:52.986
Yo, Heatherton.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.911
Man, was that a party or what?

01:04.087 --> 01:06.419
Step to it, Marine.

01:16.633 --> 01:19.879
All right,
home again, home again.

01:19.903 --> 01:21.481
Let's get some lights on
in here.

01:21.505 --> 01:22.682
Look at that.

01:22.706 --> 01:24.550
You got rid of the piles
of magazines.

01:24.574 --> 01:26.252
Looks nice. Homey.

01:26.276 --> 01:28.187
Not "homie" as in, you know,
"You're my homie."

01:28.211 --> 01:29.222
I meant the place.

01:29.246 --> 01:30.923
I'm gonna check your, uh,

01:30.947 --> 01:32.258
fridge for some food.

01:32.282 --> 01:33.960
I just asked you
to drive me, McGee.

01:33.984 --> 01:36.629
Always happy to drive you, boss.

01:36.653 --> 01:38.631
There's nothing in here
but fish food.

01:38.655 --> 01:40.633
Well, you know what I could do?

01:40.657 --> 01:41.801
I could, uh,

01:41.825 --> 01:43.336
feed the fish,
and if you get hungry,

01:43.360 --> 01:44.871
you could eat the fish.

01:44.895 --> 01:47.040
Sorry. It's a bad joke.

01:47.064 --> 01:49.157
Uh, you need help
with your shoes, or?

01:51.435 --> 01:53.835
All right.

01:57.274 --> 01:59.485
Got a new lock
on the front door.

01:59.509 --> 02:01.807
That's to keep out
unwanted guests.

02:03.647 --> 02:05.582
All right,
pick you up in the morning.

02:16.626 --> 02:19.686
I know my goldfish didn't eat
a T-bone.

02:24.067 --> 02:26.160
Pay you back, Agent Gibbs.

02:59.870 --> 03:02.148
Friends are welcome.

03:02.172 --> 03:04.717
You're not a friend.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.352
I need your help.

03:06.376 --> 03:08.054
I didn't want anyone
to see us talking.

03:08.078 --> 03:09.055
You're paranoid.

03:09.079 --> 03:10.823
I'm clean.

03:10.847 --> 03:12.325
I'm off the juice.

03:12.349 --> 03:13.893
Who do you think's watching you?

03:13.917 --> 03:16.262
Guy named Aaron Szwed.
He's got a trucking company.

03:16.286 --> 03:18.865
Friend of mine from the Corps
has been doing work for him.

03:18.889 --> 03:20.982
Questionable work.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.025
Go on.

03:28.865 --> 03:30.076
This is...

03:30.100 --> 03:31.677
This is Heatherton and me.

03:31.701 --> 03:34.680
After we got shipped stateside.

03:34.704 --> 03:37.683
Wife and kid left him.
He had some trouble

03:37.707 --> 03:39.819
making the transition
back to civilian.

03:39.843 --> 03:42.555
Unlike you?

03:42.579 --> 03:44.690
I didn't carry him out of the
desert so he could wind up dead

03:44.714 --> 03:46.841
in some alley tonight.

03:50.387 --> 03:52.999
He came by for a drink.

03:53.023 --> 03:54.567
Partied. He was upset.

03:54.591 --> 03:57.703
He wanted to tell me something
about the last job, and I...

03:57.727 --> 03:59.338
You what?

03:59.362 --> 04:02.241
I blacked out again.

04:02.265 --> 04:04.110
Is your head straight?

04:04.134 --> 04:06.746
I only had a couple
of beers, I swear.

04:06.770 --> 04:09.115
Only had a couple you remember.

04:09.139 --> 04:13.041
He's still laying
out there, Gunny.

04:22.319 --> 04:23.629
- Hello.
- Hey, McGee.

04:23.653 --> 04:27.054
- Yeah, boss?
- Day's not over.

04:43.073 --> 04:44.917
Well, it's, uh...
It's the District.

04:44.941 --> 04:47.920
So, technically,
it's Metro's jurisdiction.

04:47.944 --> 04:50.323
But we can take it
if we find a reason.

04:50.347 --> 04:51.857
Cooperating witness.

04:51.881 --> 04:54.227
Heatherton's not active service.

04:54.251 --> 04:56.696
Hasn't been
since he was wounded in Iraq.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.732
I'll call Metro.

04:59.756 --> 05:00.967
If they can kick it

05:00.991 --> 05:02.902
to the Bureau's Violent
Crimes Task Force,

05:02.926 --> 05:05.304
they can hand it off to us.

05:05.328 --> 05:06.872
Get, uh, Ziva
and DiNozzo out of bed.

05:06.896 --> 05:08.441
What?

05:08.465 --> 05:10.734
Wake 'em up.

05:13.436 --> 05:16.015
Right, um...
Get them out of bed,

05:16.039 --> 05:17.783
because it's the middle
of the night and they're asleep.

05:17.807 --> 05:19.085
Yes.

05:19.109 --> 05:21.654
Individual beds.
Get them out of individual beds.

05:21.678 --> 05:23.222
I was confused.
I thought we were talking...

05:23.246 --> 05:25.358
Need some sleep yourself,
do you, McGee?

05:25.382 --> 05:26.781
Uh, no.

05:28.051 --> 05:30.042
You got bags under your eyes.

05:31.354 --> 05:33.332
It's a look that I'm going for.

05:33.356 --> 05:35.916
Believe me now?

05:37.694 --> 05:40.273
What was Heatherton doing
for Szwed?

05:40.297 --> 05:42.708
Driving a truck.
Like, serious driving.

05:42.732 --> 05:45.177
Last run was cross-country
and back in less than a week.

05:45.201 --> 05:47.079
He...

05:47.103 --> 05:49.048
He said he messed up,
but he had to.

05:49.072 --> 05:51.802
Something about being
a human first.

05:53.743 --> 05:56.589
Heatherton was recruiting me
for the next run.

05:56.613 --> 05:58.858
And, um...

05:58.882 --> 06:00.126
Szwed offered it to me.

06:00.150 --> 06:01.327
When?

06:01.351 --> 06:04.163
Before I came to see you.

06:04.187 --> 06:08.715
I went to see Szwed at
his warehouse out in Manassas.

06:11.227 --> 06:13.172
You Lucas?

06:13.196 --> 06:15.975
Where's Heatherton?
Expecting two of you.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.576
You guys haven't seen him?

06:17.600 --> 06:18.678
Is this the wheelman?

06:18.702 --> 06:20.513
Yeah.

06:20.537 --> 06:22.515
But our boy Heatherton's
gone missing.

06:22.539 --> 06:23.949
That guy's unreliable.

06:23.973 --> 06:25.351
I'm not.

06:25.375 --> 06:29.655
Your friend told me
you can drive.

06:29.679 --> 06:31.424
If the money's right.

06:31.448 --> 06:33.125
Really?

06:33.149 --> 06:34.493
It's a two-man job.

06:34.517 --> 06:36.896
We'll roll tomorrow.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.751
I got someone in mind.

06:39.956 --> 06:41.901
This is a murder investigation.

06:41.925 --> 06:44.136
Szwed's body man Lucas...
he carries a jackknife.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.438
I think they killed him.

06:45.462 --> 06:47.106
You're not getting involved.

06:47.130 --> 06:48.774
What do I tell his wife, Gibbs?

06:48.798 --> 06:50.443
What do I tell his little girl?

06:50.467 --> 06:51.744
I'll tell you.

06:51.768 --> 06:53.879
You're just a witness here.

06:53.903 --> 06:55.894
And you're not a very good one.

06:57.307 --> 06:59.218
No.

06:59.242 --> 07:01.887
I'm the guy taking a dead man's
place behind the wheel.

07:01.911 --> 07:04.880
You need me, Gibbs.

07:23.766 --> 07:24.876
What happened to your face?

07:24.900 --> 07:26.211
What happened to your arm?

07:26.235 --> 07:27.913
The job.

07:27.937 --> 07:29.165
Same.

07:37.613 --> 07:39.891
Office said you just got home
a few hours ago.

07:39.915 --> 07:42.361
RICO case.

07:42.385 --> 07:44.029
Couple of Mob hits.

07:44.053 --> 07:45.564
Deep cover.

07:45.588 --> 07:47.556
No sugar?

07:51.727 --> 07:55.094
Try not to look so chipper.

08:11.347 --> 08:12.791
All right, go.

08:12.815 --> 08:15.375
I'm taking your crime scene.

08:17.153 --> 08:19.131
Let me hop in the shower.

08:19.155 --> 08:21.453
Tobias.

08:24.126 --> 08:26.762
Nice slippers.

08:32.802 --> 08:35.147
Oh, sorry.

08:35.171 --> 08:38.383
It's okay.

08:38.407 --> 08:39.451
You were sleeping.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.953
I know.

08:42.977 --> 08:45.757
It's kind of like
being in a cave

08:45.781 --> 08:47.392
with a hibernating bear,
you know?

08:47.416 --> 08:48.727
Makes me nervous.

08:48.751 --> 08:51.163
I'll fall right back to sleep.

08:51.187 --> 08:52.964
You can do that?

08:52.988 --> 08:54.833
Wish I could.

08:54.857 --> 08:56.101
My brain,

08:56.125 --> 08:59.271
once I'm awoken,
just keeps going.

08:59.295 --> 09:01.197
Starts spinning. Can't stop it.

09:02.364 --> 09:05.911
That would get irritating.

09:05.935 --> 09:08.346
Yeah. I wish my brain
had an on/off switch, you know?

09:08.370 --> 09:10.015
In the Corps, you learn

09:10.039 --> 09:12.784
to get your sleep
wherever you can.

09:12.808 --> 09:15.187
Well, that makes sense.

09:15.211 --> 09:16.855
You never know

09:16.879 --> 09:18.710
what's going to happen next,
right?

09:35.064 --> 09:36.374
Any time, Alice.

09:36.398 --> 09:37.476
Boss.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.643
I wasn't sleeping.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.760
Werth and I were just
talking about how...

09:42.171 --> 09:43.839
All right.
Let's go process the scene.

09:46.142 --> 09:49.512
You're already doing it,
aren't you?

09:56.018 --> 09:59.464
This time of year,
gaining weight, I got knots.

09:59.488 --> 10:02.367
That's because you sleep
in a chair.

10:02.391 --> 10:04.202
It's not a chair.

10:04.226 --> 10:05.637
It's a not-chair?

10:05.661 --> 10:07.939
It's a top-of-the-line
Comfortastic brand

10:07.963 --> 10:09.107
gentlemen's reclining chaise,

10:09.131 --> 10:12.277
with a pretty terrific
massage feature

10:12.301 --> 10:14.279
and pretty fantastic cup holder.

10:14.303 --> 10:17.215
It is a massage chair
that gives you knots.

10:17.239 --> 10:19.332
It is not healthy.

10:20.176 --> 10:22.187
I can assure you, dear boy,

10:22.211 --> 10:25.915
with the passing years,
the knots do not get any looser.

10:27.216 --> 10:31.029
For the sake of your health,
give up the chair.

10:31.053 --> 10:35.433
Can we just not...
not say "knot" anymore?

10:35.457 --> 10:37.369
Thank you.

10:37.393 --> 10:40.071
So, what are we... what are we
looking at here, Ducky?

10:40.095 --> 10:42.007
Well, his throat's been slit

10:42.031 --> 10:44.676
with what appears to be
a serrated blade.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.978
Blood loss would have been
extreme and immediate.

10:47.002 --> 10:50.606
So, I would give you odds
that he did not...

10:52.875 --> 10:54.809
It would have been quick.

10:57.813 --> 11:00.959
Bureau's case file
on Aaron Szwed

11:00.983 --> 11:02.527
for interstate trafficking.

11:02.551 --> 11:05.197
It's just allegations.

11:05.221 --> 11:07.766
He runs a fleet of trucks
moving product overland.

11:07.790 --> 11:09.901
That's legit.

11:09.925 --> 11:11.369
His delivery rate is higher
than industry average.

11:11.393 --> 11:12.704
Prices are higher, too.

11:12.728 --> 11:16.241
He uses two drivers
per rig, alternating.

11:16.265 --> 11:17.745
Heatherton told me
one's always armed.

11:18.901 --> 11:21.046
Came across our radar last year,

11:21.070 --> 11:22.914
when one of his drivers shot
a would-be hijacker.

11:22.938 --> 11:25.217
The firearm
was legally registered.

11:25.241 --> 11:27.118
Szwed didn't take any flack.

11:27.142 --> 11:31.323
Gerald Lucas is listed
as his head of security.

11:31.347 --> 11:32.357
But I couldn't find

11:32.381 --> 11:34.226
any employment records
for Heatherton.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.493
He was off the books.

11:35.517 --> 11:37.662
Why don't we bring him in
and ask him about it?

11:37.686 --> 11:39.397
Three reasons.

11:39.421 --> 11:40.799
What's he moving,

11:40.823 --> 11:42.934
where's he moving it,
and who's he moving it for?

11:42.958 --> 11:43.969
It's tough to run

11:43.993 --> 11:45.437
an interrogation
if you don't know

11:45.461 --> 11:48.106
the who, what, why,
where, and how.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.722
We know the when.

11:50.766 --> 11:52.143
Yeah, Duck?

11:52.167 --> 11:54.397
About two minutes.

11:57.506 --> 11:59.133
No, stay.

12:00.809 --> 12:03.021
Eat.

12:03.045 --> 12:05.013
Drink.

12:06.081 --> 12:07.859
No, I'm good.

12:07.883 --> 12:10.784
You're good when I say
you're good.

12:12.821 --> 12:15.016
And the lab says you're good.

12:30.873 --> 12:33.351
Cooperating witness, Jethro?

12:33.375 --> 12:36.154
Come on, what's the real story?

12:36.178 --> 12:39.057
Ah, he was a Marine.

12:39.081 --> 12:41.293
He saved his friend's life.

12:41.317 --> 12:42.727
A couple other guys, too.

12:42.751 --> 12:46.631
Corps didn't work out?

12:46.655 --> 12:48.733
Seems like a team guy.

12:48.757 --> 12:51.369
He's a Marine
who broke the rules.

12:51.393 --> 12:53.190
You didn't lock him up?

12:55.898 --> 12:57.889
I gave him a medal.

12:59.835 --> 13:02.514
I had one just lying around.

13:02.538 --> 13:06.484
You know, it's not
like he's wearing your pin.

13:06.508 --> 13:08.253
You're not going steady
with the guy.

13:08.277 --> 13:09.788
Tobias, it didn't mean anything.

13:09.812 --> 13:12.280
I think it meant
something to him.

13:21.256 --> 13:23.134
We can use
the information he's got.

13:23.158 --> 13:24.636
Gives us the inside track.

13:24.660 --> 13:26.104
But it doesn't go
further than that.

13:26.128 --> 13:28.273
It doesn't matter what he thinks
he owes his friend.

13:28.297 --> 13:30.775
In some Eastern cultures,

13:30.799 --> 13:33.011
it is believed
that if you save a man's life,

13:33.035 --> 13:35.447
you become responsible for him.

13:35.471 --> 13:38.083
I can imagine the pain
the poor boy

13:38.107 --> 13:40.518
must be experiencing
at the loss.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.987
Assuming he's part of one
of those Eastern cultures.

13:43.011 --> 13:45.156
Oh, east, west,
the mutual saving of a life

13:45.180 --> 13:47.125
is a powerful bond.

13:47.149 --> 13:51.096
As evidenced by the two of you.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.230
Is that why we're friends?

13:52.254 --> 13:53.932
It's more like shared misery.

13:53.956 --> 13:55.266
God knows you've got
enough to go around.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.635
Hey, I'm a happy guy.

13:57.659 --> 13:59.738
Since when?

13:59.762 --> 14:00.939
You don't know
what I've been doing.

14:00.963 --> 14:02.240
I haven't seen you in months.

14:02.264 --> 14:03.475
Well, whose fault is that?

14:03.499 --> 14:04.609
You only call
when you need something.

14:04.633 --> 14:06.244
Well, apparently
when I need grief.

14:06.268 --> 14:08.346
Uh, staying

14:08.370 --> 14:11.516
on that subject for a moment,
if we could,

14:11.540 --> 14:14.652
and the sad discoveries
I've made of the departed.

14:14.676 --> 14:17.389
I've found severe fractures
of the first,

14:17.413 --> 14:19.023
second, and third metacarpals.

14:19.047 --> 14:21.515
Recently? I just found them.

14:23.285 --> 14:24.763
Very recent.

14:24.787 --> 14:26.898
Yeah, it appears

14:26.922 --> 14:29.734
the bones have been
systematically crushed.

14:29.758 --> 14:31.970
Someone tried
to get him to talk.

14:31.994 --> 14:33.120
I wonder what he had to say.

14:41.236 --> 14:42.447
I'm awake.

14:42.471 --> 14:44.939
We didn't say anything, McGee.

14:48.110 --> 14:50.188
But you did something,
didn't you?

14:50.212 --> 14:52.223
What'd you do?

14:52.247 --> 14:56.194
Did you try and put
my hand in this water?

14:56.218 --> 14:57.495
That's a little juvenile.

14:57.519 --> 14:59.998
You drew on my face, didn't you?

15:00.022 --> 15:02.100
You drew on my face.

15:02.124 --> 15:03.501
No.

15:03.525 --> 15:05.370
I suggested stripping you naked,
putting

15:05.394 --> 15:06.704
and dragging you down
to Autopsy,

15:06.728 --> 15:08.306
so when you woke up,
you'd think you were dead.

15:08.330 --> 15:10.308
But Ziva thought
it was in poor taste.

15:10.332 --> 15:12.377
Well, thank you, Ziva.

15:12.401 --> 15:14.579
I did not agree.

15:14.603 --> 15:16.014
I think there are
a lot of people

15:16.038 --> 15:17.266
who'd like to see you naked.

15:20.142 --> 15:22.253
Anything
in Heatherton's apartment?

15:22.277 --> 15:24.037
Nothing out of the ordinary,
Sleeping Beauty.

15:24.813 --> 15:26.090
Szwed.

15:26.114 --> 15:28.460
Couple of speeding tickets
two weeks ago.

15:28.484 --> 15:30.462
One in Texas, one in New Mexico.

15:30.486 --> 15:33.398
Hmm, he gets around.

15:33.422 --> 15:36.868
So, who's this confidential
witness that's got Gibbs

15:36.892 --> 15:38.970
so gung ho
about taking this guy down?

15:38.994 --> 15:40.872
Confidential.

15:40.896 --> 15:44.175
Oh, I see.

15:44.199 --> 15:45.944
Well, in that case,
I'm not gonna tell you

15:45.968 --> 15:49.180
what Ziva did to you
while you were napping.

15:49.204 --> 15:50.882
Please, Ziva didn't do
anything to me.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.074
Whatever you say, McGee.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.386
Ziva.

15:55.410 --> 15:57.503
Damon?

15:58.313 --> 16:01.305
I was just, um, peeing in a cup.

16:03.252 --> 16:04.796
Yeah, uh, Damon, let's,
um, let's head on down.

16:04.820 --> 16:05.964
Right this way.

16:05.988 --> 16:07.899
Szwed's truck rolls
in six hours.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.001
- What do you got?
- We got nothing.

16:10.025 --> 16:11.593
I don't like the sound of that.

16:12.761 --> 16:14.058
We got nothing!

16:16.698 --> 16:19.210
Szwed's a trafficker
who has escalated to murder.

16:19.234 --> 16:20.378
We got to stop the truck.

16:20.402 --> 16:22.514
Or we can put someone on it.

16:22.538 --> 16:23.515
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:23.539 --> 16:25.517
We talking about letting
Johnny Rambo

16:25.541 --> 16:26.684
go all First Blood again?

16:26.708 --> 16:27.785
Gee, I hope not.

16:27.809 --> 16:29.654
Putting way too much trust
in this guy.

16:29.678 --> 16:31.942
Sounds like a big gamble,
Jethro.

16:33.982 --> 16:36.883
Let it ride.

16:59.641 --> 17:01.719
You told me to wake you up
at 2:00.

17:01.743 --> 17:03.612
- What?
- It's 2:00.

17:05.146 --> 17:07.925
Thanks.

17:07.950 --> 17:11.061
Hey, remember when you went
to Africa?

17:11.086 --> 17:12.763
Uh, yeah, it left an impression.

17:12.788 --> 17:14.098
You think there's,

17:14.122 --> 17:18.069
um, any chance
that maybe you came in contact

17:18.093 --> 17:22.272
with a tsetse fly
that was carrying the protozoan

17:22.297 --> 17:24.709
trypanosoma brucei?

17:24.733 --> 17:26.044
Abby, I don't have
sleeping sickness.

17:26.068 --> 17:28.279
I'm just exhausted.

17:28.303 --> 17:31.015
I had no idea
how hard Gibbs works.

17:31.039 --> 17:33.785
I mean, keeping up with
his schedule's gonna kill me.

17:33.809 --> 17:35.086
McGee, you can't do that, okay?

17:35.110 --> 17:36.988
He's been practicing this
for, like, years.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.122
Abby, I owe him.

17:38.146 --> 17:39.357
For saving your life?

17:39.381 --> 17:40.825
That's part
of his job description.

17:40.849 --> 17:43.161
He pushed me out of the way
of a speeding car.

17:43.185 --> 17:45.163
Pushing people is
really rude, McGee.

17:45.187 --> 17:47.212
Seriously.

17:48.724 --> 17:51.836
He's up at the crack of dawn,
if he goes to bed at all.

17:51.860 --> 17:55.473
What exactly is running
through that guy's veins?

17:55.497 --> 17:56.808
Coffee, McGee.

17:56.832 --> 17:58.676
Right, boss.

17:58.700 --> 17:59.997
No, get me some.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.095
On it, boss.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.966
And get everyone ready.

18:07.409 --> 18:10.321
You're enjoying having a valet.

18:10.345 --> 18:11.835
You done?

18:14.282 --> 18:15.827
And the tox screen?

18:15.851 --> 18:20.198
Positive for flunitrazepam.

18:20.222 --> 18:21.849
Werth was roofied.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.491
Is there anything else you need?

18:26.595 --> 18:28.995
If there is, McGee will do it.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.712
Last one to use the van
should have to clean it out.

18:34.736 --> 18:36.080
There should be a rule.

18:36.104 --> 18:38.316
There is.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.251
Well, who was
the last one to use it?

18:40.275 --> 18:41.276
You were.

18:42.444 --> 18:45.023
I don't think so.

18:45.047 --> 18:47.992
'Cause it smells like falafels.

18:48.016 --> 18:50.228
And I know a certain
backup probie agent

18:50.252 --> 18:51.947
that smells a little falafely.

18:53.221 --> 18:54.365
You want to help?

18:54.389 --> 18:56.768
Sure.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.487
Thank you.

19:02.597 --> 19:05.009
- Probie?
- Yeah, I'm in the process

19:05.033 --> 19:07.912
of becoming a sworn NCIS agent.

19:07.936 --> 19:09.480
Thought you had to be
an American citizen

19:09.504 --> 19:11.249
to join a federal agency.

19:11.273 --> 19:13.351
I'm also in the process
of becoming an American citizen.

19:13.375 --> 19:16.554
I thought you had to be a
legal resident for, you know...

19:16.578 --> 19:18.089
There are a few strings
being tugged.

19:18.113 --> 19:19.424
Pulled.

19:19.448 --> 19:20.925
You pull strings.

19:20.949 --> 19:22.226
You tug heart strings.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.028
The heart has strings?

19:24.052 --> 19:25.363
According to the poets.

19:25.387 --> 19:26.964
Don't confuse the girl.
It's taken a lot

19:26.988 --> 19:28.032
of marionetting
to get her this far.

19:28.056 --> 19:29.853
And who's the puppet master?

19:32.427 --> 19:35.073
Well, it's probably best
if we table the issue

19:35.097 --> 19:37.141
of qualifications
in case someone asks

19:37.165 --> 19:39.210
how you're qualified
to be on this op.

19:39.234 --> 19:41.779
Not my first rodeo.

19:41.803 --> 19:43.448
I know that, cowboy.

19:43.472 --> 19:45.083
Okay, ready to roll here.

19:45.107 --> 19:46.784
Yeah, boss,
let's get this guy out of here.

19:46.808 --> 19:48.019
He needs to be wired.

19:48.043 --> 19:49.754
Yeah,
we got to get him in first.

19:49.778 --> 19:51.522
Then we wire him?

19:51.546 --> 19:52.790
We got a plan for that.

19:52.814 --> 19:54.225
McGee, go.

19:54.249 --> 19:57.729
These are aerial photos
of Szwed's distribution hub

19:57.753 --> 19:59.063
in Manassas.

19:59.087 --> 20:00.631
That's the loading dock,

20:00.655 --> 20:03.634
access road
which leads to Route 409.

20:03.658 --> 20:07.038
Now, this is Gerald Lucas,
Aaron Szwed.

20:07.062 --> 20:08.372
I pulled, uh,

20:08.396 --> 20:11.142
prepass tracking numbers
on all of their rigs.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.643
Somehow I doubt that'll help.

20:12.667 --> 20:13.778
Well, maybe we'll get lucky.

20:13.802 --> 20:15.213
No, no, the less
we leave to luck,

20:15.237 --> 20:16.837
the better with a civilian
on the inside.

20:18.073 --> 20:20.405
Putting a lot
of faith in you, son.

20:21.610 --> 20:23.254
Observe only.

20:23.278 --> 20:25.590
- Understood.
- One of ours

20:25.614 --> 20:27.158
goes with you as your partner.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.292
Find out what's in the truck

20:28.316 --> 20:29.660
and take it to the other end.

20:29.684 --> 20:30.895
We'll be following,

20:30.919 --> 20:32.079
then we'll bust both sides.

20:32.921 --> 20:33.931
Two ways to follow.

20:33.955 --> 20:35.233
Rule number 27.

20:35.257 --> 20:36.634
First way,
they never notice you.

20:36.658 --> 20:37.902
Second way,

20:37.926 --> 20:39.570
they only notice you.

20:39.594 --> 20:43.052
One team inside,
two teams trailing.

20:44.699 --> 20:46.410
Fornell's with me.

20:46.434 --> 20:48.334
Well, then where are we?

20:55.277 --> 20:57.336
They're on their way in, boss.

21:05.287 --> 21:06.764
You made it.

21:06.788 --> 21:08.599
My partner.

21:08.623 --> 21:12.103
What, no comment
about me being a woman?

21:12.127 --> 21:13.771
You're kidding.

21:13.795 --> 21:16.832
Like if I had a choice, I'd hang
around with more dudes, huh?

21:18.200 --> 21:20.111
And it'll make patting you down
more enjoyable.

21:20.135 --> 21:22.013
Try not to enjoy it too much.

21:22.037 --> 21:24.028
Good luck with that.

21:29.678 --> 21:31.389
All right.

21:31.413 --> 21:32.557
Got the telescopic mic up.

21:32.581 --> 21:33.724
Check it out.

21:33.748 --> 21:34.725
Pretty cool.

21:34.749 --> 21:36.561
Nothing yet.

21:36.585 --> 21:37.995
A lot of big,
heavy walls in there.

21:38.019 --> 21:39.197
I gave them the blueprints.

21:39.221 --> 21:40.565
I'm sure they'll find
a sweet spot.

21:40.589 --> 21:43.668
That's a lot of joe you got.

21:43.692 --> 21:46.684
Double-fisting it, huh?

21:48.730 --> 21:52.643
I'd be careful
with that much caffeine, uh...

21:52.667 --> 21:56.013
That is sugar.

21:56.037 --> 21:57.882
That's a lot of sugar.

21:57.906 --> 22:00.308
Oh, yeah.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.848
Mmm, there we go.

22:11.486 --> 22:13.631
What's pretty boy
mumbling about now?

22:13.655 --> 22:16.434
Wow, can you hold a grudge.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.002
He broke my nose.

22:18.026 --> 22:19.537
He dislocated my shoulder, okay?

22:19.561 --> 22:20.771
Well, you have another shoulder.

22:20.795 --> 22:22.840
I only have one nose
and it's on my face.

22:22.864 --> 22:24.375
I mean, it's on my face, McGee.

22:24.399 --> 22:25.676
Look, it was two years ago.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.045
Just drop it.

22:28.069 --> 22:32.083
That would be fine,
but he keeps coming back.

22:32.107 --> 22:35.786
Gibbs should tell him
to just... be on his way.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.756
Go live his own life.

22:38.780 --> 22:40.458
Actually, Ducky thinks
that Gibbs feels

22:40.482 --> 22:42.727
a connection to Werth
since we saved him.

22:42.751 --> 22:43.895
Two schools of thought

22:43.919 --> 22:46.197
on the lifesaving/
responsibility issue:

22:46.221 --> 22:47.832
You got Robin Hood:

22:47.856 --> 22:50.501
Prince of Thieves versus
The World's Greatest Athlete.

22:50.525 --> 22:51.636
I saw that one.

22:51.660 --> 22:55.406
The blond white guy
with the African tribe.

22:55.430 --> 22:56.908
It's the young
Jan-Michael Vincent.

22:56.932 --> 22:59.277
Loved him on Airwolf.

22:59.301 --> 23:01.579
Stringfellow Hawke...

23:01.603 --> 23:03.281
that may be the best
character name ever.

23:03.305 --> 23:04.649
The tribe believed

23:04.673 --> 23:07.118
that the lifesaver had
to take care of the savee.

23:07.142 --> 23:08.719
Versus Prince of Thieves

23:08.743 --> 23:10.955
where Costner saved
Morgan Freeman's life,

23:10.979 --> 23:13.357
so Azeem follows Robin Hood
all around trying

23:13.381 --> 23:15.626
to save his life
to relieve the debt.

23:15.650 --> 23:17.962
Well, Werth served his country.

23:17.986 --> 23:20.097
I don't know what it is exactly
we owe him,

23:20.121 --> 23:21.866
but we do owe him something.

23:21.890 --> 23:23.434
Do me a favor.

23:23.458 --> 23:25.153
Pace yourself with that stuff.

23:32.033 --> 23:33.678
What is that sound?

23:33.702 --> 23:35.346
You came prepared.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.181
Yeah, I was a Boy Scout.

23:37.205 --> 23:39.450
Not what I heard.

23:39.474 --> 23:41.018
What are you looking for,
anyway?

23:41.042 --> 23:44.011
Privacy.

23:45.013 --> 23:46.857
I'm holding
onto your cell phones.

23:46.881 --> 23:48.192
You can have 'em back
after we're done.

23:48.216 --> 23:49.784
You know how to handle a CB?

23:51.920 --> 23:53.888
Collect your gear.

23:56.591 --> 23:58.970
I'm sure you got
a lot of questions.

23:58.994 --> 24:00.004
Just one.

24:00.028 --> 24:01.305
Shoot.

24:01.329 --> 24:03.194
Where's the truck?

24:07.502 --> 24:09.380
You hire a cleaning lady
or something?

24:09.404 --> 24:11.949
Nope.

24:11.973 --> 24:13.408
Looks different in here.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.342
You want a hand?

24:24.452 --> 24:25.963
Yeah. Gibbs.

24:25.987 --> 24:27.765
Hey, boss.
We got a truck pulling in.

24:27.789 --> 24:29.867
Looks like it might be
getting close to kickoff.

24:29.891 --> 24:31.035
What's your 20?

24:31.059 --> 24:32.536
Switching cars.
We'll be on the road.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.106
This really is a big deal
for you, isn't it,

24:35.130 --> 24:36.574
letting me drive your car?

24:36.598 --> 24:39.066
Yeah, whatever.
You already slept with my wife.

24:55.216 --> 24:57.161
Hey, swap the plates,
strip the markings.

24:57.185 --> 24:58.796
Your partner's nice to look at.

24:58.820 --> 25:00.998
She double-clutch?

25:01.022 --> 25:02.133
Hey, I navigate.

25:02.157 --> 25:04.001
And men are terrible
with maps anyway, right?

25:04.025 --> 25:05.703
Where are we going?

25:05.727 --> 25:07.405
Not far.

25:07.429 --> 25:09.294
And, uh, what are we taking?

25:12.642 --> 25:14.872
What's in the truck?

25:20.608 --> 25:22.269
What's in the truck?

25:25.146 --> 25:26.511
What's in the truck?

25:30.251 --> 25:31.562
Melons?

25:31.586 --> 25:33.431
Did she say "melons"?

25:33.455 --> 25:35.433
Melons in the truck.

25:35.457 --> 25:37.568
Melons...

25:37.592 --> 25:39.503
What are in these melons?

25:39.527 --> 25:41.927
- We're moving melons?
- Yeah.

25:44.232 --> 25:46.343
You're moving 'em
out of the truck.

25:46.367 --> 25:47.578
Now.

25:47.602 --> 25:49.313
- Empty it.
- We are driving

25:49.337 --> 25:50.815
a truck full of nothing?

25:50.839 --> 25:52.830
Not for long.

25:56.544 --> 25:59.590
I don't think this is
a trafficking job at all.

25:59.614 --> 26:01.025
It's a hijacking.

26:01.049 --> 26:03.040
And we are the hijackers.

26:21.736 --> 26:24.281
All right,
she's a triple-digit ride.

26:24.305 --> 26:26.217
Big ol' pumpkins in there,
but don't get tempted.

26:26.241 --> 26:28.085
If we got to get
on the big slab,

26:28.109 --> 26:29.220
you stay to the granny lane

26:29.244 --> 26:30.721
and you keep it under
the double nickel

26:30.745 --> 26:32.223
even while
you're running deadhead.

26:32.247 --> 26:34.024
And bird-dog on the dash,
so you don't get shot

26:34.048 --> 26:35.493
in the back by bears.
You got it?

26:35.517 --> 26:37.561
- 10-4.
- All right, let's roll.

26:37.585 --> 26:39.416
Hey, we got to pit stop.

26:40.855 --> 26:41.832
Three-quarters of a tank.

26:41.856 --> 26:43.334
I don't like to take chances.

26:43.358 --> 26:45.236
GPS tracking puts 'em
in Front Royal in a few hours.

26:45.260 --> 26:47.872
Let's make it quick.

26:47.896 --> 26:52.743
Um, what language was that?

26:52.767 --> 26:54.645
He says she's fast
but not to push her,

26:54.669 --> 26:55.846
even when we're driving empty,

26:55.870 --> 26:58.849
and to, uh, watch out for cops.

26:58.873 --> 27:00.651
So the truck is a she?

27:00.675 --> 27:02.836
Let's go rob someone.

27:07.182 --> 27:09.026
That's them.

27:09.050 --> 27:12.463
Wow, Ferrari.

27:12.487 --> 27:14.978
I had a hamster named Ferrari.

27:16.624 --> 27:18.502
And here's the truck.

27:18.526 --> 27:21.205
The markings are stripped,
new plates.

27:21.229 --> 27:22.840
That explains why.

27:22.864 --> 27:25.355
Szwed's not driving the truck.

27:26.401 --> 27:28.670
Let's look for the sign.

27:30.038 --> 27:32.216
Looks like our guy's having
a little bit of trouble.

27:32.240 --> 27:35.119
How hard is it to drive
one of those things?

27:35.143 --> 27:36.940
I know cars, not trucks.

27:38.746 --> 27:40.124
Well, it's a six-speed.

27:40.148 --> 27:43.093
Plus, the half step
makes it a 12.

27:43.117 --> 27:45.529
You got to clutch to get in,
clutch to get out.

27:45.553 --> 27:47.531
Can't keep his foot off
the brake.

27:47.555 --> 27:49.934
Hey, will you stop tapping
your fingers?!

27:49.958 --> 27:51.869
I'm not just tapping my fingers,
I'm watching

27:51.893 --> 27:53.637
his taillights; It's Morse code.

27:53.661 --> 27:55.706
F-U!

27:55.730 --> 27:58.409
E-L.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.010
"Fuel." Tony,

28:00.034 --> 28:01.545
they're stopping for fuel.

28:01.569 --> 28:03.662
Yeah, you're done
with the coffee.

28:04.606 --> 28:06.283
Well, it's empty anyway.

28:06.307 --> 28:07.818
Listen, can we stop
at the gas station, too?

28:07.842 --> 28:09.320
I need a refill.

28:09.344 --> 28:12.523
Well, we're the invisible
tail car, not the visible one.

28:12.547 --> 28:14.071
Your teeth are chattering.

28:17.485 --> 28:19.697
Boss,
near a service station on 409.

28:19.721 --> 28:21.565
Possible rendezvous spot.
Where are you at?

28:21.589 --> 28:23.580
We just passed it.

28:46.047 --> 28:48.125
Slow down.

28:48.149 --> 28:49.460
- Tobias!
- What?!

28:49.484 --> 28:51.128
It was a mistake
to let you drive this car.

28:51.152 --> 28:53.330
Don't get
your underpants in a twist.

28:53.354 --> 28:54.665
I know what I'm doing.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.667
Don't you believe me?

28:56.691 --> 28:58.002
No! No, I don't.

28:58.026 --> 28:59.169
I don't believe any of it!

28:59.193 --> 29:00.304
You drive like a maniac!

29:00.328 --> 29:01.939
My impression of you!

29:01.963 --> 29:03.907
Use the 91, moron.

29:03.931 --> 29:05.809
Nice car.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.111
How are you guys doing?

29:07.135 --> 29:09.146
I'm doing. Nice ride.

29:09.170 --> 29:11.001
If you go for the Mopar.

29:13.207 --> 29:14.351
I'm getting a Slim Jim!

29:14.375 --> 29:16.577
- I don't want a Slim Jim!
- I wasn't asking you!

29:18.680 --> 29:20.807
Ma'am.

29:21.816 --> 29:23.093
Cash for the diesel.

29:23.117 --> 29:24.928
What you got in there?

29:24.952 --> 29:26.363
Under the hood?

29:26.387 --> 29:28.299
Bring me the change.

29:28.323 --> 29:30.567
Pushing 500 horse.

29:30.591 --> 29:32.870
Got about a hundred grand
in her. '72?

29:32.894 --> 29:36.140
'71. Got a 426 Hemi.

29:36.164 --> 29:39.009
- She'll eat you up.
- Real power is torque.

29:39.033 --> 29:41.445
I thought it was
against the rules

29:41.469 --> 29:43.747
to have your girl ride along.

29:43.771 --> 29:46.784
No markings on the truck.

29:46.808 --> 29:48.503
What are you,
a Gypsy or something?

29:49.477 --> 29:50.842
Step away from the truck, man.

29:52.947 --> 29:53.947
Please.

30:00.388 --> 30:02.132
My mistake.

30:02.156 --> 30:03.282
You win.

30:12.300 --> 30:14.962
Let's roll.

30:19.407 --> 30:22.986
Well, Werth was very convincing.

30:23.010 --> 30:25.489
What exactly are the skeletons
in this guy's closet

30:25.513 --> 30:27.491
you didn't want
to tell me about?

30:27.515 --> 30:32.329
Small bout
of steroid-induced psychosis.

30:32.353 --> 30:33.980
Oh, great.

30:39.560 --> 30:40.891
Damon.

30:47.034 --> 30:49.279
Can you hear me, McGee?

30:49.303 --> 30:51.048
Roger that. 10-2, you are

30:51.072 --> 30:52.383
loud and proud. Come back.

30:52.407 --> 30:54.284
- Are you okay, McGee?
- Yeah, I'm good.

30:54.308 --> 30:56.587
Tony's driving, I've been
studying up on the lingo.

30:56.611 --> 30:58.222
How are you?

30:58.246 --> 31:01.692
We are, um... fine.

31:01.716 --> 31:03.293
So where's the drop stop?

31:03.317 --> 31:04.561
Where are you taking the cargo?

31:04.585 --> 31:05.796
The truck is empty now.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.464
We believe
they have a heist planned

31:07.488 --> 31:09.400
and the target is in transit.

31:09.424 --> 31:11.135
Front Royal.

31:11.159 --> 31:14.338
10:00 p.m.

31:14.362 --> 31:15.739
Okay, well,
assuming it's something big

31:15.763 --> 31:17.908
and on the road,
it's got to be a cargo vehicle.

31:17.932 --> 31:19.476
I'm gonna check
the national registry,

31:19.500 --> 31:21.745
compile bills of lading,
check the weigh stations.

31:21.769 --> 31:23.781
See, we've got...

31:23.805 --> 31:25.716
government agencies
that keep track of that stuff.

31:25.740 --> 31:27.317
Hey, did you know
the brotherhood of truckers

31:27.341 --> 31:28.552
is the lifeblood of America?

31:28.576 --> 31:30.854
It's true. Over.

31:30.878 --> 31:32.723
Well, I'm glad that is over.

31:32.747 --> 31:35.225
Ziva? Ziva, you there?

31:35.249 --> 31:37.046
Ziva?

31:38.052 --> 31:39.052
Ziva?

31:43.291 --> 31:47.694
Hey... relax.

31:50.298 --> 31:54.011
Heatherton drove the lead Hummer
in our convoy...

31:54.035 --> 31:55.345
when we were hit.

31:55.369 --> 32:00.017
My friends who know
about these things

32:00.041 --> 32:03.086
tell me it is a science.

32:03.110 --> 32:05.155
Trauma intensifies memory,

32:05.179 --> 32:07.324
which can make it feel
ever present.

32:07.348 --> 32:09.960
There a reason for that?

32:09.984 --> 32:14.431
Perhaps to teach you,

32:14.455 --> 32:16.433
so you do not allow it
to happen again.

32:16.457 --> 32:18.755
I keep getting stuck
in my own history.

32:21.662 --> 32:23.574
Look, the last time
we saw each other,

32:23.598 --> 32:24.641
you were in control.

32:24.665 --> 32:26.610
You helped us.

32:26.634 --> 32:27.945
Even after everything

32:27.969 --> 32:31.632
you have gone through,
you can move forward.

32:33.074 --> 32:36.237
You can find
the right path, Damon.

32:42.216 --> 32:43.760
Slow down. Slow down!

32:43.784 --> 32:44.862
What?!

32:44.886 --> 32:46.063
Not you. McGee.

32:46.087 --> 32:47.064
Right.

32:47.088 --> 32:49.249
Sorry about that, boss.

32:49.357 --> 32:52.402
He got an I.D. on the
shipment they're gonna hijack?

32:52.426 --> 32:55.172
I got an address in Alexandria.

32:55.196 --> 32:58.108
Garage owned
by a David Devoisier.

32:58.132 --> 32:59.543
Truck cleared
a weigh station in Roanoke

32:59.567 --> 33:01.078
40 minutes ago.

33:01.102 --> 33:02.179
Bill of lading?

33:02.203 --> 33:03.847
Assorted machinery.

33:03.871 --> 33:06.750
Put the pedal to the metal,
Tobias.

33:06.774 --> 33:09.299
Still won't make it before dark.

33:10.878 --> 33:13.757
I was expecting
a delivery, not federal agents.

33:13.781 --> 33:15.559
You receive a lot
of specialty machine parts

33:15.583 --> 33:16.960
in the middle of the night?

33:16.984 --> 33:18.195
When a project gets
my attention,

33:18.219 --> 33:19.296
it gets all my attention,

33:19.320 --> 33:21.365
no matter what time it is.

33:21.389 --> 33:25.969
So why does this particular
shipment raise the red flag?

33:25.993 --> 33:28.372
We believe there's an attempt
about to be made to hijack it.

33:28.396 --> 33:30.774
An attempt by whom?

33:30.798 --> 33:32.209
That's part
of an ongoing investigation.

33:32.233 --> 33:34.177
We can't reveal that,

33:34.201 --> 33:35.836
but the truck originated
in San Diego.

33:38.005 --> 33:39.563
Then it's Aaron Szwed.

33:40.441 --> 33:42.419
You can bleach a blue collar,

33:42.443 --> 33:44.521
but that doesn't make it white.

33:44.545 --> 33:45.722
What makes you think of him?

33:45.746 --> 33:46.890
He has a vested interest

33:46.914 --> 33:48.358
in stealing
what's in that truck.

33:48.382 --> 33:49.593
Why?

33:49.617 --> 33:51.662
Because it is his.

33:51.686 --> 33:52.896
A true gentleman...

33:52.920 --> 33:56.667
which clearly he is not...
honors a wager.

33:56.691 --> 33:57.668
What kind of wager?

33:57.692 --> 33:59.903
Well, the kind that I won.

33:59.927 --> 34:01.690
And that he lost.

34:04.632 --> 34:07.157
This is all about a bet?

34:24.418 --> 34:25.862
Do come in.

34:25.886 --> 34:28.699
Szwed was in over his head.

34:28.723 --> 34:31.335
He was throwing away money
he couldn't afford to lose.

34:31.359 --> 34:35.472
He wanted to prove that he could
run with the faster crowd.

34:35.496 --> 34:37.007
Want a drink?

34:37.031 --> 34:38.507
No.

34:38.532 --> 34:40.710
What exactly was on the table?

34:40.735 --> 34:43.714
His best car versus mine.

34:43.737 --> 34:45.215
A race?

34:45.239 --> 34:46.949
Cross-country.

34:46.974 --> 34:48.619
Winner takes pink slips.

34:48.643 --> 34:51.288
Precisely.

34:51.312 --> 34:53.380
Yes, I know it's dangerous.

34:54.482 --> 34:56.426
You'll have to forgive
an idle man

34:56.449 --> 34:58.562
his reckless indulgence.

34:58.586 --> 35:00.706
Sure, speed limits...
they're really just suggestions.

35:01.889 --> 35:03.467
I've already cleared
the space out

35:03.491 --> 35:04.935
for my trophy;
It's on my truck now.

35:04.959 --> 35:06.470
Just the two of you?

35:06.494 --> 35:09.373
Support teams trailing
in case of emergency.

35:09.397 --> 35:11.775
Spare tires, what have you.

35:11.799 --> 35:13.977
That would be Heatherton.

35:14.001 --> 35:15.879
I heard Szwed cursing that name

35:15.903 --> 35:17.414
at the finish line in San Diego.

35:17.438 --> 35:19.750
He was furious that he was
nowhere to be found

35:19.774 --> 35:22.486
when he overheated
outside Barstow.

35:22.510 --> 35:24.655
Red-lining through the desert.

35:24.679 --> 35:25.789
Heatherton cost him the race.

35:25.813 --> 35:26.871
So he claimed.

35:27.782 --> 35:28.892
He's dead, you know.

35:28.916 --> 35:30.794
Pardon?

35:30.818 --> 35:32.396
Who's dead?

35:32.420 --> 35:34.498
Heatherton... he was murdered.

35:34.522 --> 35:37.047
I hadn't heard.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.236
That's terrible.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.438
That does give Szwed a motive.

35:41.462 --> 35:44.141
Can you get a hold
of your driver?

35:44.165 --> 35:45.976
Sure.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.298
Why? Do you want
to stop my truck?

35:54.008 --> 35:55.252
All of his movements, McGee.

35:55.276 --> 35:58.055
I've got Devoisier
on a commercial flight...

35:58.079 --> 36:00.490
San Diego to Dulles.

36:00.514 --> 36:01.591
It was a week ago.

36:01.615 --> 36:02.726
I'm also seeing
his speeding tickets.

36:02.750 --> 36:05.062
Seems to be a lot
of those going around.

36:05.086 --> 36:07.197
Szwed had two... Amarillo, Texas,

36:07.221 --> 36:09.599
and Tucumcari, New Mexico.

36:09.623 --> 36:10.734
Get your kicks on Route 66.

36:10.758 --> 36:13.403
Actually shows up here
as Interstate 40.

36:13.427 --> 36:15.272
Look for any unsolved
incident reports off that route.

36:15.296 --> 36:16.440
Absolutely, boss.

36:16.464 --> 36:18.442
You worried we're missing
a fender bender?

36:18.466 --> 36:21.812
McGee, gonna lose you.

36:21.836 --> 36:22.946
Yeah, boss, I was just about...

36:22.970 --> 36:25.632
Wait, boss, boss...

36:27.041 --> 36:30.487
Get this... their cars are
in the back of the truck.

36:30.511 --> 36:33.323
What kind of cars
are worth killing for?

36:33.347 --> 36:34.691
I can think of a few.

36:34.715 --> 36:37.294
Szwed was driving a Maybach.

36:37.318 --> 36:38.695
Are you kidding me?

36:38.719 --> 36:40.664
It's worth like a quarter
of a million.

36:40.688 --> 36:43.667
And Devoisier... a 1970

36:43.691 --> 36:45.368
Plymouth Barracuda convertible.

36:45.392 --> 36:47.404
Barracuda.

36:47.428 --> 36:48.905
Gibbs would like that.

36:48.929 --> 36:50.328
Hemi?

36:53.501 --> 36:55.112
Pull over here.

36:55.136 --> 36:57.696
The truck's going to be coming
down the road on your left.

37:00.374 --> 37:03.553
Use the trailer
to block the road.

37:03.577 --> 37:05.704
Wait for my signal.

37:07.148 --> 37:09.776
Copy. Good plan.

37:13.821 --> 37:15.332
McGee, what's our plan?

37:15.356 --> 37:16.800
I don't know.

37:16.824 --> 37:18.301
I lost connection with Gibbs.

37:18.325 --> 37:19.936
He went dark. We're...

37:19.960 --> 37:21.028
Whoa, God!

37:22.997 --> 37:24.875
Tony. Tony!

37:24.899 --> 37:26.526
- Hang on, McGee!
- Tony!

37:34.775 --> 37:36.470
Nuts!

37:39.413 --> 37:41.658
That's him.

37:41.682 --> 37:42.759
Werth, pull out.

37:42.783 --> 37:43.760
Pull out now!

37:43.784 --> 37:45.729
- Block the road.
- What do we do?

37:45.753 --> 37:47.297
We stop the truck.

37:47.321 --> 37:49.755
It's too late to go
back now anyway.

37:56.797 --> 37:58.594
What the?

38:07.041 --> 38:08.406
Come on, get out of there.

38:30.464 --> 38:32.625
And you people think I'm crazy.

38:35.102 --> 38:37.093
Put a gun on the driver!

38:40.341 --> 38:42.118
Please do not resist.

38:42.142 --> 38:43.787
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

38:43.811 --> 38:45.779
Come on, come on,
come on, open up!

38:48.749 --> 38:51.361
Do I even have to tell you?

38:51.385 --> 38:52.647
You're under arrest.

39:00.995 --> 39:02.772
Thank you.

39:02.796 --> 39:04.774
Thank you for returning them.

39:04.798 --> 39:07.510
Boys and their cars.

39:07.534 --> 39:10.002
I'm a hot-rod girl myself.

39:11.538 --> 39:15.352
So, uh, how much does something
like this go for, anyway?

39:15.376 --> 39:18.154
I paid $1.2 million.

39:18.178 --> 39:19.304
What?!

39:20.514 --> 39:22.016
Are you stupid?

39:23.450 --> 39:25.145
Stock...

39:26.120 --> 39:29.633
Hemi 'Cuda convertible.

39:29.657 --> 39:31.034
From 1970.

39:31.058 --> 39:33.436
Only 18 made, Abbs.

39:33.460 --> 39:37.607
Wow, an actual Hemi 'Cuda.

39:37.631 --> 39:39.175
That's like...

39:39.199 --> 39:41.978
the holy grail
of muscle cars, huh?

39:42.002 --> 39:44.481
- Perfectly restored.
- No.

39:44.505 --> 39:45.916
Not perfect.

39:45.940 --> 39:47.417
- How do you mean?
- Always take a magnet

39:47.441 --> 39:49.500
when you look at used cars.

39:52.980 --> 39:54.524
The magnet sticks to metal.

39:54.548 --> 39:56.675
It does not stick...

39:59.620 --> 40:02.599
to Bondo.

40:02.623 --> 40:03.967
Quick repair job.

40:03.991 --> 40:05.268
You have a little accident?

40:05.292 --> 40:06.803
We already got Szwed and Lucas

40:06.827 --> 40:08.738
for the attempted hijacking,

40:08.762 --> 40:11.207
but they swear
that they didn't kill anybody.

40:11.231 --> 40:13.443
And we believe 'em.

40:13.467 --> 40:15.211
So, we went looking
for another motive.

40:15.235 --> 40:18.548
Followed your path out west
to a report

40:18.572 --> 40:21.551
of a hit-and-run
in Weatherford, Oklahoma.

40:21.575 --> 40:23.954
18-year-old girl
crossing the street.

40:23.978 --> 40:25.722
We sent Heatherton's picture

40:25.746 --> 40:27.457
to the hospital.
He brought her in,

40:27.481 --> 40:29.159
and he stayed with her

40:29.183 --> 40:30.760
until she died.

40:30.784 --> 40:32.262
You'd stop at nothing to win.

40:32.286 --> 40:33.997
Including red lights.

40:34.021 --> 40:35.532
But you could not

40:35.556 --> 40:37.233
destroy this machine.

40:37.257 --> 40:40.370
So you killed Nick Heatherton...
the only witness.

40:40.394 --> 40:44.874
You want to bet I find traces
of blood and hair

40:44.898 --> 40:47.844
when I start taking
this whole thing apart,

40:47.868 --> 40:49.733
piece by piece?

41:05.753 --> 41:08.331
I am not looking forward
to this next conversation.

41:08.355 --> 41:10.266
It is better to do it in person.

41:10.290 --> 41:13.269
Tell Heatherton's wife
that her husband

41:13.293 --> 41:15.105
died for being a Good Samaritan.

41:15.129 --> 41:16.619
That he was a good man.

41:18.699 --> 41:20.276
And that Devoisier is not.

41:20.300 --> 41:23.167
Well, see you later.

41:24.371 --> 41:25.782
See you later.

41:25.806 --> 41:28.952
Heatherton's wife lives
in Cleveland, huh?

41:28.976 --> 41:30.253
I went to school in Columbus.

41:30.277 --> 41:31.788
I've got some friends
in the area.

41:31.812 --> 41:33.757
I could make some calls
if you're looking for work.

41:33.781 --> 41:35.225
I'd appreciate it.

41:35.249 --> 41:37.160
Need a lift?

41:37.184 --> 41:38.617
I'll walk.

41:50.064 --> 41:52.675
So was that, like,

41:52.699 --> 41:55.145
"see you later," like good-bye,

41:55.169 --> 41:57.147
or "see you later," like,

41:57.171 --> 42:00.607
"Hey, I'm gonna see you
at a later date"?

42:02.609 --> 42:06.089
Are you having trouble
understanding simple English?

42:06.113 --> 42:08.377
Just answer the question.
