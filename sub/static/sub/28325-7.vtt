WEBVTT

00:08.891 --> 00:10.391
You'd probably really like my ex-wife.

00:10.428 --> 00:11.601
I mean, most people do.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.186
Well, most men do.

00:13.223 --> 00:14.972
With hindsight, Lucy and I
probably should have

00:15.009 --> 00:17.085
gotten to know each other better.

00:17.163 --> 00:18.553
You know, the only things we
had in common

00:18.590 --> 00:21.172
were high sex drives
and our firm belief

00:21.209 --> 00:23.074
in the film career of David Caruso.

00:23.178 --> 00:26.352
Both of those caused us just
years of heartbreak.

00:26.622 --> 00:28.376
All of which couldn't have been avoided

00:28.487 --> 00:30.587
with just a couple of
more sober dates like this one.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.017
Yeah.

00:32.054 --> 00:33.849
This is a really sober date.

00:33.926 --> 00:35.021
Just the soberest.

00:35.058 --> 00:36.308
Isn't it?

00:36.345 --> 00:37.752
Two people out enjoying each other

00:37.789 --> 00:40.565
on a bright, sunny afternoon.

00:40.815 --> 00:43.532
So unbelievably sunny.

00:43.569 --> 00:45.773
Are you sweating
from every pore as well?

00:45.810 --> 00:47.234
Yes.

00:47.356 --> 00:49.887
Maybe it's the
aerodynamics of this bike?

00:50.241 --> 00:52.648
I feel like we're
pedaling an IMAX screen.

00:52.873 --> 00:54.857
Well, would you like to, uh,

00:54.894 --> 00:56.903
as the kids say, uh...

00:57.054 --> 00:58.683
pull over and park?

00:58.755 --> 01:01.974
Uh, really? Ooh.

01:02.037 --> 01:05.912
I feel like I'm... every
inch of me is sticky.

01:06.444 --> 01:10.481
But sure, yeah,
let's make out at 11:00 a.m.

01:10.518 --> 01:11.817
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.744
- What the heck, right?
- Okay.

01:18.705 --> 01:22.184
Look, I've been dying for you
to make a move for weeks.

01:22.221 --> 01:25.664
But it's way too hot for
any form of physical embrace.

01:25.795 --> 01:27.085
Agreed. So, uh...

01:27.173 --> 01:29.698
Well, just lips and tongue then.

01:30.236 --> 01:31.677
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.483
Uh...

01:40.757 --> 01:43.132
- Okay, I'm calling it.
- We really tried!

01:43.169 --> 01:44.685
We did. We tried.

01:51.766 --> 01:54.362
<i>I caught that broadcast
you and Gabby did.</i>

01:54.399 --> 01:56.748
- Yeah?
- That was, uh... unique.

01:56.913 --> 01:58.037
Well,

01:58.074 --> 02:00.291
we got some nice think pieces
out of it.

02:00.367 --> 02:02.459
Also some pretty strong backlash,

02:02.496 --> 02:04.445
but then there was
a pretty big backlash

02:04.464 --> 02:05.531
to the backlash.

02:05.568 --> 02:07.998
- So...
- Hey, listen.

02:08.086 --> 02:11.146
You two broadcast
a spring training game

02:11.183 --> 02:12.986
and made people give a shit.

02:13.086 --> 02:15.836
They should pin a goddamn medal
on both of you.

02:16.161 --> 02:17.775
I told the Oakland brass

02:17.927 --> 02:19.379
my dying wish is that

02:19.416 --> 02:21.583
you and Gabby take over the TV booth.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.936
Well, boy, Matt,
I appreciate that gesture,

02:23.973 --> 02:26.525
but I really wish you
would not talk like that.

02:26.562 --> 02:27.786
What? Dying wish?

02:27.823 --> 02:30.270
That's just something you say
from a hospital bed

02:30.307 --> 02:31.702
to get what you want.

02:32.849 --> 02:34.829
Got me that pallet of Dunkaroos.

02:34.884 --> 02:36.994
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

02:37.186 --> 02:38.452
Those things are discontinued.

02:38.489 --> 02:40.298
I mean, it's like I'm eating dodo eggs.

02:40.335 --> 02:42.308
Hey.

02:42.345 --> 02:44.047
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Maggie.

02:44.084 --> 02:45.134
Thank you.

02:45.171 --> 02:46.744
I didn't know you'd be here today.

02:46.865 --> 02:48.459
I am.

02:49.098 --> 02:50.648
How... how are you?

02:50.759 --> 02:52.510
- Good.
- Excellent.

02:52.697 --> 02:54.796
- Thank you.
- Oh, well, laters.

02:54.847 --> 02:56.481
Mm-hmm.

02:56.882 --> 02:58.291
Wow.

02:58.423 --> 03:00.265
I was gonna ask how the date went,

03:00.302 --> 03:03.411
but it's pretty clear
you did not dunk your roo.

03:03.557 --> 03:04.790
Did not.

03:05.111 --> 03:06.732
Yeah, I... she's the first person

03:06.769 --> 03:08.516
I've ever tried to be with in sobriety.

03:08.553 --> 03:10.862
You know, I have absolutely no clue

03:11.054 --> 03:12.180
how to convince somebody

03:12.217 --> 03:14.791
to have sex with me
without the aid of alcohol.

03:14.942 --> 03:16.534
You just need practice.

03:16.591 --> 03:18.920
Here, I'll help you.

03:19.128 --> 03:20.528
Come on. Try and fuck me.

03:20.565 --> 03:22.004
No. No, no.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.949
No, I take role play very seriously.

03:24.093 --> 03:26.094
Neither of us are
in the proper wardrobe,

03:26.131 --> 03:28.686
and my wig guy
is still in Baltimore, so...

03:28.762 --> 03:30.204
What... what are you afraid of?

03:30.241 --> 03:31.782
Come on. Don't be a pussy.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.266
I'm already in bed half naked,

03:34.303 --> 03:36.354
Come on, see if you can
get your dick sucked.

03:37.664 --> 03:40.072
- Make a move. Let's go.
- Uh, all right.

03:40.414 --> 03:42.005
Hey, hey.

03:42.086 --> 03:43.844
Jeez, what... get... No!

03:43.922 --> 03:46.277
- Ew! Gross. Pass!
- Come on.

03:46.497 --> 03:48.231
Just grabbing a handful of titty?

03:48.303 --> 03:51.110
I'm not your whore, Brockmire.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.444
Try it again.

03:52.668 --> 03:54.809
Remember I'm a goddamn lady.

03:55.247 --> 03:57.073
Hang on.
You got a little eyelash there.

03:57.119 --> 03:58.226
Hold on.

03:58.263 --> 04:00.202
Oh, I see. You're doing "eyelash"?

04:00.279 --> 04:02.279
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

04:02.357 --> 04:03.706
What are you, the Fonz?

04:03.782 --> 04:06.027
- Oh, all right.
- Do I look like Pinky Tuscadero?

04:06.064 --> 04:08.750
Get out of 1974, you desperate hack.

04:08.830 --> 04:10.562
God, you're terrible at this!

04:10.599 --> 04:12.068
I told you that I was.

04:12.105 --> 04:13.942
Look. All right. Let's just try this.

04:14.022 --> 04:16.644
This'll be another unique
experience for you.

04:16.795 --> 04:18.031
Be honest.

04:18.069 --> 04:20.345
Tell her you want her

04:20.382 --> 04:23.007
to take your sober virginity,

04:23.088 --> 04:25.723
but you're scared.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.692
The vulnerability angle
worked great for me

04:27.729 --> 04:29.832
when I first got diagnosed with cancer.

04:29.901 --> 04:31.212
Got a ton of ass.

04:31.249 --> 04:32.554
Weren't you still married to Meegan

04:32.591 --> 04:34.258
when you were first diagnosed?

04:34.565 --> 04:35.831
Yeah, we had one of those marriages

04:35.868 --> 04:38.218
where we both agreed to be
terrible people.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.183
I had one of those.

04:41.537 --> 04:44.413
Well, she had that agreement.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.958
<i>So you ready to go get dinner?</i>

04:47.995 --> 04:49.505
You know, before we go out,

04:49.542 --> 04:50.782
do you mind if I take a shower?

04:50.819 --> 04:52.808
I came here straight from work.

04:52.996 --> 04:54.404
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.342
- Now?
- Yeah.

04:56.494 --> 04:58.571
Yeah, sure. Go right ahead.

04:58.645 --> 05:00.512
There's towels and stuff in there.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.469
Okay.

05:02.892 --> 05:06.343
So I'll just be naked in there

05:06.921 --> 05:08.587
should you need anything.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.077
It'd be weird if you weren't.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.173
I mean, wouldn't it?

05:15.327 --> 05:16.925
Yeah.

05:21.711 --> 05:23.318
Okay.

05:23.759 --> 05:25.653
Am I missing something?

05:25.851 --> 05:26.956
- Whoa!
- Oh!

05:26.999 --> 05:28.203
I forgot Clemenza was in there.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.410
So sorry about that.

05:29.447 --> 05:30.899
It's all right.
You can shower with him.

05:30.936 --> 05:32.637
He likes to wet his little toesies.

05:32.713 --> 05:35.280
Just... if he starts nipping at
you, he's not kidding around.

05:35.317 --> 05:38.024
That's his one flaw.
He lacks a sense of humor.

05:38.121 --> 05:40.561
Uh, can you get him out of here?

05:40.598 --> 05:41.796
Oh, of course.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.446
My bad. I am so sorry.

05:43.483 --> 05:44.673
Come on, Clemenza.

05:46.286 --> 05:49.028
Not nice to scare the nice lady.

05:49.147 --> 05:50.981
It's not funny.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.850
You know, I've been
looking for the right moment

05:52.886 --> 05:54.650
to talk to you
about our whole deal here.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.361
The thing is, I've never had
a relationship sober.

05:57.513 --> 05:59.280
Boy, I've never even had sex sober.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.467
Yeah, come to think of it,

06:00.504 --> 06:02.792
I don't think I have ever
seen a naked woman...

06:02.868 --> 06:04.685
Say, how are you?

06:04.722 --> 06:05.519
'Cause that...

06:05.556 --> 06:07.113
I like every bit of that.

06:07.239 --> 06:09.514
Shut up and kiss me, please.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.028
Absolutely.

06:12.065 --> 06:13.980
Mm.

06:14.226 --> 06:17.647
<i>Hey, before we get into this,
I have a confession to make.</i>

06:17.706 --> 06:20.194
I used to listen to
your podcast all the time.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.130
I just... I didn't want you to
see me as some weird groupie.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.490
Oh, no. I love groupies.

06:26.527 --> 06:28.044
No, seriously.

06:28.081 --> 06:29.742
They guarantee that at least one person

06:29.806 --> 06:31.295
in this relationship likes me.

06:32.461 --> 06:34.370
All those stories you used to tell

06:34.483 --> 06:37.841
about your sexual exploits
around the world...

06:37.905 --> 06:40.571
- Yeah.
- Really turned me on.

06:40.997 --> 06:42.378
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.456 --> 06:46.062
Well, then allow me to introduce you

06:46.099 --> 06:49.946
to a veritable buffet
of sexual delights.

06:50.439 --> 06:53.926
A smorgasbord of
orgasm-inducing delicacies

06:54.078 --> 06:55.737
from around the globe.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.467
I'm talking about
the Chi-Town Get-Down.

06:58.578 --> 07:00.957
A Thousand and One A-Labian Nights.

07:00.994 --> 07:02.720
Ooh, the Bangkok Bang Cock.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.683
The Bangkok Tangkok.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.855
Now, that last one, that involves

07:05.931 --> 07:07.189
us going to the store to get Tang.

07:07.290 --> 07:08.340
But, uh, it's worth it.

07:08.688 --> 07:09.770
Hey.

07:09.807 --> 07:11.333
- Nothing's happening down there.
- I know.

07:11.370 --> 07:12.424
Is everything okay?

07:12.461 --> 07:14.460
My penis normally jumps up,

07:14.497 --> 07:16.029
like a rambunctious golden retriever

07:16.066 --> 07:17.159
on his way to the park.

07:17.196 --> 07:18.432
Could I give it a try myself?

07:18.469 --> 07:19.959
- Sure.
- I call this maneuver.

07:19.996 --> 07:21.863
"Billy Joel's the Stranger."

07:21.900 --> 07:23.163
See, 'cause I go in lefty.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.332
Okay.

07:24.387 --> 07:25.505
Um...

07:25.542 --> 07:27.080
- I have an idea.
- Yeah.

07:27.117 --> 07:29.854
I'd like to take my penis
and fold it in half

07:29.935 --> 07:32.873
and just kind of jam it
on in there with my thumb

07:32.950 --> 07:35.315
in hopes that once it gets wet
it will expand

07:35.352 --> 07:37.492
like one of those fun dinosaur sponges.

07:37.559 --> 07:39.267
What do you say?

07:39.418 --> 07:40.705
Give it a try?

07:40.984 --> 07:42.892
- Cool. Yeah.
- It could work.

07:43.932 --> 07:46.044
Okay.

07:46.359 --> 07:47.862
Okay.

07:47.899 --> 07:49.271
Boy, I am so sorry.

07:49.308 --> 07:50.849
So I'ma stop.

07:50.886 --> 07:52.810
And I'm gonna work through my shame

07:52.904 --> 07:53.954
by going down on you.

07:53.991 --> 07:55.105
So, you know,

07:55.142 --> 07:56.415
clear out your next couple hours.

07:56.452 --> 07:57.731
Because my overcompensation

07:57.768 --> 08:00.785
is gonna become your erotic marathon!

08:00.957 --> 08:02.308
Here I go.

08:03.181 --> 08:04.604
All right.

08:04.682 --> 08:06.365
Just getting into position.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.200
Hello, my hooded friend.

08:08.352 --> 08:10.702
Okay.

08:11.149 --> 08:12.568
Okay.

08:14.522 --> 08:17.178
I mean, I don't like to
toot my pussy-eating horn here,

08:17.263 --> 08:19.594
but it was... No,
it was a bravura performance.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.071
She would have given me a standing O,

08:21.090 --> 08:22.876
well, if her legs had still worked.

08:22.913 --> 08:25.823
But... even my enjoyment at her total

08:25.860 --> 08:27.418
and complete satisfaction

08:27.455 --> 08:30.095
could not rouse my hibernating hog.

08:30.132 --> 08:32.684
It was just...
it was devastating, people.

08:32.876 --> 08:33.986
You know.

08:34.143 --> 08:36.061
I mean, I'm sure I'm not
the only man in here

08:36.097 --> 08:37.424
to have dealt with impotence.

08:37.462 --> 08:39.173
I mean, am I right, guys?

08:40.315 --> 08:42.717
Hmm? Really, guys?

08:42.755 --> 08:45.480
I mean, there's more handicap
placards out there than cars.

08:45.517 --> 08:48.090
But in this room
full of medical maladies,

08:48.127 --> 08:50.307
I'm the only human being
to have dealt with this issue.

08:50.394 --> 08:52.020
Is that what you're telling me?

08:52.463 --> 08:54.037
Larry?

08:54.679 --> 08:56.173
Look at me, Larry.

08:56.325 --> 08:58.041
I'm looking at you, Larry.

08:58.701 --> 09:00.494
Because you're an elderly gentleman

09:00.531 --> 09:02.188
with circulatory problems

09:02.240 --> 09:03.789
who's battling prostate cancer,

09:03.933 --> 09:05.337
yet somehow, some way,

09:05.374 --> 09:07.207
you're just hard as a rock
down there on demand?

09:07.244 --> 09:08.385
Is that it?

09:08.520 --> 09:09.687
Jim.

09:10.044 --> 09:12.181
They had to amputate your foot, Larry.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.955
'Cause not enough blood
was flowing to it.

09:15.279 --> 09:16.998
Probably all just pooling there

09:17.035 --> 09:18.816
in your rock-hard Johnson, huh?

09:18.888 --> 09:19.938
Come on, Jim.

09:19.975 --> 09:21.272
Are you hard right now, Larry?

09:21.343 --> 09:22.567
Jim, knock it off.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.129
If we wheeled you
into the center of the room,

09:24.165 --> 09:25.612
could we play ring-toss with it?

09:25.722 --> 09:27.422
- Jim!
- Larry!

09:27.459 --> 09:28.897
Jim!

09:30.025 --> 09:31.625
Larry!

09:34.125 --> 09:36.358
Have some regrets about the way
I handled things with Larry.

09:36.395 --> 09:38.107
I do think that most of his tears

09:38.144 --> 09:39.585
were due to his time in Nam, though.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.972
Well, you know, you have only
yourself to blame.

09:42.418 --> 09:45.669
A man with anxiety so bad
he can't count out loud

09:45.789 --> 09:48.300
should not be trying to get
a boner in front of a stranger.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.086
Well, I've never had
the dick yips, Shirley.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.227
Mm-hmm. Sure.

09:51.264 --> 09:52.588
- I haven't.
- Okay.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.256
A woman once chipped
her tooth on my whiskey dick

09:55.293 --> 09:57.327
during a particularly sloppy blowjob.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.199
Well, maybe your penis
is trying to tell you

09:59.235 --> 10:00.470
that it's too soon to date.

10:00.753 --> 10:01.994
You're still working the steps.

10:02.031 --> 10:04.241
So what, my dick
has a moral compass now?

10:04.278 --> 10:06.799
After all the appalling things
it's had me do?

10:06.893 --> 10:09.430
A month ago,
it made me fuck a croissant.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.904
I'm so in my head with this thing,

10:10.941 --> 10:12.850
I can't even get it up
to masturbate anymore.

10:12.868 --> 10:14.018
Can you believe that?

10:14.610 --> 10:15.986
My dong is like some kind of

10:16.005 --> 10:18.525
sad little one-eyed Charlie Brown

10:18.562 --> 10:20.740
that's too depressed
to even lift his head up.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.750
God, I wish the program
allowed me to take Viagra.

10:23.787 --> 10:24.964
Well, it does,

10:25.001 --> 10:27.044
as long as it's not a trigger for you.

10:27.116 --> 10:28.766
Me, I never have abused it.

10:28.869 --> 10:30.035
I mean, every time I took it,

10:30.072 --> 10:31.495
I went on a crystal meth bender.

10:31.532 --> 10:33.424
But that was only, like,
eight or ten times a year.

10:33.461 --> 10:34.888
So no Viagra.

10:35.215 --> 10:37.337
Jim, I'm thinking that we've reached

10:37.374 --> 10:40.009
the point in your recovery
where it's time for you

10:40.046 --> 10:42.521
to take some responsibility
for your own solutions.

10:43.038 --> 10:44.868
Yeah? So what do you think

10:44.909 --> 10:46.387
would make a good fix?

10:46.424 --> 10:48.029
Well, I still haven't found
a higher power

10:48.066 --> 10:49.273
that I can believe in, I mean,

10:49.310 --> 10:50.953
without rolling my eyes anyway.

10:50.990 --> 10:53.182
But I'm just gonna have to
let go of the wheel

10:53.219 --> 10:54.854
and let something else take control

10:54.891 --> 10:56.821
or I'm never gonna quiet my mind

10:56.858 --> 10:59.452
and be free of this anxiety, am I?

11:01.062 --> 11:02.991
That was right.
I just got that right, didn't I?

11:03.315 --> 11:05.145
Holy shit! I'm starting to get it.

11:05.224 --> 11:06.420
That is great.

11:06.496 --> 11:08.815
You are now emotionally 18.

11:08.949 --> 11:11.616
But do you mind if I skip the part

11:11.653 --> 11:14.324
where I bang the
alcoholic epiphany gong?

11:14.361 --> 11:15.969
'Cause I really gotta pick up my kid.

11:16.006 --> 11:17.264
I'm guessing you, uh,

11:17.301 --> 11:18.701
you weren't a cheerleader
in high school,

11:18.737 --> 11:19.837
- Am I right, Shirley?
- No.

11:19.874 --> 11:21.110
I did once stab a cheerleader

11:21.147 --> 11:22.786
with a pencil once in eighth grade.

11:22.862 --> 11:24.429
'Cause the bitch stole my lighter.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.765
I gotta go.

11:27.361 --> 11:29.818
My sponsor, ladies and gentlemen.

11:30.212 --> 11:31.770
So long.

11:33.665 --> 11:36.023
I know it's been a drought,
but don't worry.

11:36.199 --> 11:39.191
A storm is coming to drop 6 3/4 inches

11:39.286 --> 11:41.160
right on your head.

11:41.373 --> 11:42.589
Come on, Jim.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.333
Cum all over these people's faces.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.961
They want you to!

11:47.593 --> 11:48.897
God dammit, Brockmire.

11:49.026 --> 11:50.264
The town is counting on you.

11:50.341 --> 11:54.019
If there's no snow,
the whole economy is ruined.

11:55.032 --> 11:57.294
The winter season
keeps these people afloat, Jim.

11:57.331 --> 11:58.555
Come on. Come on!

11:58.592 --> 12:00.616
All right, I'm definitely putting

12:00.653 --> 12:02.761
too much pressure on myself now.

12:04.344 --> 12:05.935
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:05.972 --> 12:08.166
I'm off work in an hour.

12:08.225 --> 12:09.518
Oh, Maggie.

12:09.555 --> 12:11.793
At this point, I'm like Wile E. Coyote

12:11.830 --> 12:14.538
and your vagina is a tunnel
painted on a mountain.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.853
I want very much to be inside,

12:16.890 --> 12:18.987
but physics is against me.

12:19.511 --> 12:22.627
Well, I still want to see you tonight.

12:22.794 --> 12:25.206
I just enjoy spending time with you.

12:25.243 --> 12:26.718
It's comfortable, like

12:26.980 --> 12:28.835
dating an old leather chair.

12:28.912 --> 12:30.245
Well,

12:30.415 --> 12:32.023
you do always have a standing offer

12:32.060 --> 12:33.914
to sit right there on my face.

12:35.203 --> 12:36.892
You don't have to constantly offer

12:36.929 --> 12:38.018
to go down on me.

12:38.055 --> 12:39.416
We can just talk.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.877
Or, more realistically,
you can talk and I can listen.

12:41.996 --> 12:44.700
And if you feel like trying again,

12:45.116 --> 12:46.385
we can.

12:46.552 --> 12:47.675
That's very sweet.

12:47.712 --> 12:49.712
And of course I would love
to see you tonight.

12:49.766 --> 12:52.692
And I appreciate your patience with me.

12:52.928 --> 12:54.957
You know, it's been a long time
since I liked anyone.

12:54.994 --> 12:56.775
And, uh, well,

12:56.949 --> 12:58.240
I want you to be in my life,

12:58.277 --> 13:00.378
even after Matt goes home.

13:01.644 --> 13:02.988
What?

13:03.391 --> 13:05.041
Well, Matt's not going home.

13:05.245 --> 13:06.789
What do you mean?

13:07.673 --> 13:10.785
The cancer, it spread to his organs.

13:11.172 --> 13:12.637
It has?

13:12.726 --> 13:15.432
- Since when?
- About two weeks.

13:15.702 --> 13:18.059
He never said anything.

13:18.468 --> 13:20.606
How long does he have?

13:21.591 --> 13:23.056
Not very long.

13:23.557 --> 13:24.700
I'm only telling you now

13:24.737 --> 13:27.060
because you're the only person
he talks to.

13:27.188 --> 13:29.906
I think it's just gonna be
you there at the end.

13:31.191 --> 13:32.732
Okay, god.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.039
You know, I think this is
the first time

13:35.076 --> 13:36.325
in my life I've ever been asked

13:36.362 --> 13:38.104
to give somebody comfort.

13:38.634 --> 13:40.975
I'm curious to finally hear
what gets said after.

13:41.012 --> 13:43.530
"Jim, that's enough.
You need to leave."

13:50.413 --> 13:52.948
<i>So right there on the...
on the Christmas Village?</i>

13:52.985 --> 13:55.228
- <i>Right there.</i>
- Do you aim?

13:55.386 --> 13:56.507
No, I don't aim.

13:56.582 --> 13:58.361
Where it lands is just an act of God.

13:58.398 --> 13:59.537
Or, well, it was,

13:59.574 --> 14:01.322
until my dick died.

14:01.534 --> 14:03.161
Yeah.

14:03.238 --> 14:04.754
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

14:04.791 --> 14:06.546
I haven't been able to get it up for

14:07.142 --> 14:08.474
a couple of months.

14:08.541 --> 14:09.601
That actually does.

14:09.638 --> 14:10.688
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.654
The damn thing just lies there.

14:12.691 --> 14:14.810
Hold me... Holy cats and jammers.

14:14.847 --> 14:16.527
My g... I...

14:16.588 --> 14:18.224
Wow. I feel like I should salute it.

14:18.261 --> 14:20.261
Because it's a flag pole, sir.

14:20.342 --> 14:22.000
Please tell me
it doesn't get any longer;

14:22.112 --> 14:24.375
it just plumps up
like a Ballpark Frank.

14:25.462 --> 14:26.968
I get another couple inches.

14:27.018 --> 14:28.118
What?

14:28.155 --> 14:29.193
I mean, come on.

14:29.230 --> 14:30.428
How does that even work?

14:30.465 --> 14:31.872
Well, it doesn't, really.

14:31.909 --> 14:34.188
That's the cosmic joke of it all.

14:34.225 --> 14:37.607
It is a terribly designed tool
for the job.

14:37.646 --> 14:39.445
It's like using a hammer to knit.

14:40.628 --> 14:43.565
I mean, women like to
experience it once.

14:43.602 --> 14:45.764
You know, as a fun story
to tell their friends,

14:45.801 --> 14:48.824
but they don't generally
come back for seconds.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.992
You know...

14:51.227 --> 14:53.203
I've never told anybody this.

14:54.374 --> 14:55.922
I have never,

14:55.999 --> 14:58.573
not once in my entire life,

14:58.819 --> 15:02.260
been fully inside a woman.

15:03.289 --> 15:04.723
Boy, that's heartbreaking.

15:04.814 --> 15:07.442
No, 'cause I'm picturing it now.

15:07.594 --> 15:09.126
I mean, your balls just going

15:09.163 --> 15:12.062
back and forth
in the air like that alone,

15:12.448 --> 15:15.133
like abandoned twins on a swing set.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.390
Basically every time I've had sex,

15:18.866 --> 15:21.902
neither one of us
has really enjoyed it.

15:22.443 --> 15:25.969
God damn, no wonder
I have intimacy issues.

15:28.166 --> 15:31.016
Okay, enough about
my pathetic love life.

15:31.077 --> 15:32.926
How about your pathetic love life?

15:33.287 --> 15:34.711
You got a...

15:34.748 --> 15:35.950
plan of attack there?

15:35.987 --> 15:38.154
How are you gonna
fix your little limp friend?

15:38.433 --> 15:39.692
Oh, I don't know.

15:39.729 --> 15:42.189
Uh, you know, I'm in
uncharted territory here.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.011
I mean, I can't seem to be able to

15:44.071 --> 15:45.311
do anything about it myself,

15:45.348 --> 15:47.447
so I guess I just have to let go

15:47.484 --> 15:49.347
and see what the universe can do?
I don't know.

15:49.384 --> 15:51.161
The program wants me to believe

15:51.198 --> 15:53.699
in something bigger than myself.

15:53.891 --> 15:55.231
You don't believe in God?

15:55.314 --> 15:56.364
Oh, sure I do.

15:56.401 --> 15:57.918
No, I don't believe in God.

15:57.994 --> 15:59.620
Come on. God.

15:59.813 --> 16:01.461
God is just a security blanket

16:01.498 --> 16:03.998
for people who are still
afraid of the dark.

16:04.151 --> 16:05.789
It's an existential night light

16:05.826 --> 16:07.106
that helps them sleep at night.

16:07.143 --> 16:08.904
The good news is, there's
no monster under the bed.

16:08.984 --> 16:11.254
Bad news is: no God either.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.257
But, you know, look. What do I know?

16:15.294 --> 16:18.152
I just tried and failed to
jerk off on an Alpine village.

16:18.189 --> 16:21.298
Don't put too much stock
in anything I say.

16:22.402 --> 16:24.668
What do you think happens when you die?

16:25.972 --> 16:28.153
I don't know.

16:28.256 --> 16:31.095
Come... I mean, you know,
some things are beyond words.

16:31.799 --> 16:33.704
Come on, man. Don't...

16:33.836 --> 16:34.911
Don't do that. Don't...

16:34.948 --> 16:36.431
Don't start lying to me.

16:36.507 --> 16:38.629
Not at the end.

16:39.518 --> 16:41.051
Okay.

16:42.749 --> 16:44.727
I think you decompose.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.491
I think that the energy in our body

16:47.528 --> 16:50.610
is gonna get redistributed
back out into nature.

16:51.346 --> 16:54.355
Atoms that were a million
different things before

16:54.392 --> 16:57.519
are all gonna become a million
different other things again.

16:58.342 --> 17:01.179
I think that a soul
is just consciousness.

17:01.683 --> 17:03.159
And what's consciousness?

17:03.196 --> 17:06.548
It's just a shared delusion
created by matter.

17:08.747 --> 17:10.688
That's what I think.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.556
Yeah. Shit.

17:14.387 --> 17:16.496
Me too.

17:17.239 --> 17:19.348
You know,

17:19.607 --> 17:21.826
the worst part, to me,

17:22.444 --> 17:23.878
is the...

17:23.915 --> 17:25.763
just the rotting.

17:27.460 --> 17:29.042
I mean,

17:29.959 --> 17:32.970
everything that I am...

17:34.207 --> 17:37.440
just becoming a big

17:38.202 --> 17:41.019
putrefying puddle.

17:42.076 --> 17:43.709
Hey, man.

17:43.844 --> 17:45.558
You always gotta remember
how lucky you are.

17:45.595 --> 17:46.938
Right?

17:47.052 --> 17:48.888
'Cause, of all the possible lives,

17:48.925 --> 17:51.156
you got to be a baseball man.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.165
That's gotta be in the top

17:53.202 --> 17:58.673
.00001% of things
that anybody gets to do.

17:59.399 --> 18:01.975
You were paid
to travel around the world,

18:02.123 --> 18:03.907
you showed up only
when the weather was nice,

18:03.944 --> 18:06.012
you got three months off a year,

18:06.391 --> 18:07.986
and most of all...

18:08.103 --> 18:10.740
you got to play this
beautiful children's game

18:10.777 --> 18:12.728
your whole entire life.

18:13.137 --> 18:15.750
Man, I'd have rather had your life

18:15.787 --> 18:17.841
than the goddamn Queen of England's.

18:19.386 --> 18:22.203
I was always at my best

18:22.516 --> 18:23.849
on a baseball field.

18:23.949 --> 18:25.248
Oh, man.

18:25.508 --> 18:27.267
They're like sacred places.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.094
Lit up, they're just like temples, and

18:30.689 --> 18:33.398
in darkness, they're like cemeteries.

18:36.756 --> 18:38.361
Ah, look at that.

18:38.627 --> 18:40.069
I guess I do believe in something

18:40.106 --> 18:41.639
bigger than myself:

18:41.786 --> 18:43.453
baseball.

18:44.670 --> 18:45.977
Yeah.

18:46.345 --> 18:48.219
That's a god I could believe in.

18:48.256 --> 18:50.331
A Baseball God.

18:50.484 --> 18:51.833
Yes.

18:52.104 --> 18:53.424
Yeah, a kind of God

18:53.461 --> 18:56.429
that demands that
all his churches be parks.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.589
God that forces you to play outside

18:59.626 --> 19:00.767
on a nice day.

19:00.968 --> 19:02.901
Yeah. Who doesn't keep time,

19:03.052 --> 19:04.953
because our actions
should determine our fate,

19:04.990 --> 19:07.324
not some stupid clock.

19:07.953 --> 19:10.714
Yeah. A god who keeps us humble

19:10.751 --> 19:12.768
by making us play a game

19:12.805 --> 19:15.890
- that's steeped in failure.
- Mm.

19:17.193 --> 19:19.452
That's the kind of God
that I'd worship.

19:21.248 --> 19:23.230
Well, we did.

19:23.305 --> 19:24.846
We do.

19:26.420 --> 19:28.202
We did, didn't we?

19:29.256 --> 19:30.630
Huh.

19:36.407 --> 19:37.848
When my mind was racing

19:37.931 --> 19:40.532
and the yips were just
gripping me tight,

19:40.653 --> 19:43.133
I remember how you said
that the Baseball God

19:43.170 --> 19:45.520
teaches humility through failure.

19:45.672 --> 19:47.433
Now, that's true.

19:47.737 --> 19:50.314
But he's also a God who gives gifts.

19:50.676 --> 19:54.261
A struggling hitter is granted
a swing and bunt single.

19:54.473 --> 19:58.691
A dead-arm pitcher is blessed
by a line drive double play.

19:58.985 --> 20:03.212
Sometimes the Baseball God
deems you worthy of a reprieve.

20:04.096 --> 20:05.412
<i>And I got one.</i>

20:05.449 --> 20:08.678
<i>Well, what I got was a...
it was a hand job.</i>

20:08.757 --> 20:11.871
<i>I just kept whispering to myself
over and over again,</i>

20:11.908 --> 20:13.832
<i>"I'm due. I'm due."</i>

20:13.967 --> 20:15.817
<i>It almost became like a prayer.</i>

20:16.036 --> 20:18.153
<i>And my prayer was answered.</i>

20:18.235 --> 20:19.737
<i>A little bit too well.</i>

20:19.774 --> 20:20.784
Wow.

20:20.821 --> 20:22.748
That is all over my car.

20:22.826 --> 20:25.797
Oh, when the levee breaks,
Mama, you got to move.

20:27.010 --> 20:28.844
And you're still coming.

20:28.881 --> 20:30.065
Yeah, I'm pretty pent up.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.846
Oh, Maggie,

20:31.977 --> 20:33.050
thank you so much.

20:35.897 --> 20:38.545
<i>I found my higher power in a hand job.</i>

20:38.582 --> 20:39.976
<i>It was just so stupid</i>

20:40.013 --> 20:41.734
and amazing and, well,

20:42.004 --> 20:44.387
I never got to tell you that
while you were alive, Bat.

20:44.723 --> 20:47.314
Not because we didn't
have that kind of a friendship.

20:47.428 --> 20:49.169
I was more intimate and open with you

20:49.227 --> 20:50.743
than any other man I've ever known.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.165
We just...

20:52.775 --> 20:54.992
We ran out of time, didn't we?

20:55.908 --> 20:57.487
We knew each other for 30 years,

20:57.524 --> 20:59.041
but we only enjoyed
each other's company

20:59.078 --> 21:00.938
the last five weeks.

21:01.397 --> 21:04.557
Most of our friendship
was a complete failure.

21:04.782 --> 21:09.429
But in the end, we were given
a gift from the Baseball God.

21:10.148 --> 21:12.808
One that I will always be grateful for.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.084
I'm gonna miss you, Matt Hardesty.

21:18.316 --> 21:19.960
And don't you worry.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.237
I made sure you wouldn't rot.

21:41.004 --> 21:43.738
A little of you
just went inside my mouth.

21:45.158 --> 21:46.841
Probably your dick.
