00:11.516 --> 00:12.443
Hey, Doug! Doug!

00:12.668 --> 00:13.813
Wait up a minute.

00:14.428 --> 00:16.117
I gotta ask you something.

00:16.347 --> 00:17.722
Good morning to you.

00:17.947 --> 00:19.987
How many people know
about me and Chuny?

00:20.188 --> 00:22.359
- Including the cleaning crew?
- Everyone?

00:22.587 --> 00:25.173
- That would be an understatement.
- It's just...

00:25.404 --> 00:27.738
- We've run out of things to say.
- You want out.

00:27.963 --> 00:30.713
- I think it would be best.
- You covered the spread.

00:30.939 --> 00:32.019
The office pool.

00:32.283 --> 00:35.316
I had you for next week.
But what's $5 for your happiness?

00:35.548 --> 00:38.231
You've had experience at this.
How do I end it?

00:38.459 --> 00:40.826
You know those Chinese
finger puzzles?

00:41.051 --> 00:43.604
The harder you pull on them,
the tighter they get?

00:43.836 --> 00:47.152
You gotta just relax,
then they just droop and fall off.

00:47.388 --> 00:49.460
- That sounds ominous.
- Here's what you do.

00:49.691 --> 00:53.237
Explain to her that you're doing this
for her benefit. It's been fun...

00:53.436 --> 00:56.883
...but it's interfering with work.
You don't want to ruin the friendship.

00:57.115 --> 00:58.806
Because that's what you care about.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.401
You know what?
You're frightening.

01:03.579 --> 01:05.751
- Good morning.
- You're late.

01:06.620 --> 01:09.587
I was checking the schedule.
This is it for us today? A hernia?

01:09.820 --> 01:11.249
Is that what it says?

01:14.012 --> 01:15.441
Problem, Carter?

01:15.676 --> 01:19.734
It's just that our schedule's
been pretty lightweight lately.

01:19.964 --> 01:22.614
Hernias and Hickman lines.
You could do these in your sleep.

01:22.844 --> 01:25.210
- No Hibiclens?
- No, we're out.

01:25.403 --> 01:28.054
This gives us more time
to prepare for the conference.

01:28.283 --> 01:29.331
You ready?

01:31.867 --> 01:33.176
Three o'clock sharp, right?

01:33.404 --> 01:36.470
I'm doing the first half.
You're doing the second.

01:36.859 --> 01:38.135
We'll brush up over lunch.

01:38.364 --> 01:41.364
Carter, if I need your help,
I'll ask for it, okay?

01:42.491 --> 01:45.077
Happiness is a full nursing staff.

01:45.307 --> 01:48.024
- I hope everyone is feeling healthy.
- Peachy!

01:48.251 --> 01:50.902
I'd hate to see us get hit
by the one-day flu again.

01:51.131 --> 01:51.993
It's run its course.

01:52.219 --> 01:54.161
I hope so.
I can't afford to get fired.

01:54.395 --> 01:57.078
That was just management
rattling its tired old saber.

01:57.275 --> 01:59.609
- What if they replace us?
- They won't.

01:59.836 --> 02:03.480
After our sickout, they got religion.
Negotiations are going great.

02:03.739 --> 02:05.626
Are we gonna get what we want?

02:05.883 --> 02:08.120
Commissioners are nervous.
They know the public's on our side.

02:08.347 --> 02:10.257
They won't be after they read this.

02:10.523 --> 02:11.319
Right there.

02:11.547 --> 02:12.954
- Oh, no.
- What?

02:13.180 --> 02:14.936
"Patient dies after nurses walk.

02:15.163 --> 02:18.010
An unidentified nurse
at County General Hospital...

02:18.236 --> 02:20.887
...allegedly transfused a patient
with the wrong type blood...

02:21.116 --> 02:23.799
...leading to his death
in the hospital's emergency room."

02:24.027 --> 02:24.955
Somebody died?

02:25.179 --> 02:26.554
They get that for hiring temps.

02:26.779 --> 02:30.041
"Hospital sources say the error
was the result of understaffing...

02:30.235 --> 02:34.032
...caused by an illegal
one-day sickout by ER nurses."

02:34.811 --> 02:35.607
Where's Carol?

02:35.868 --> 02:36.762
She's on at 9.

02:36.987 --> 02:39.027
Did this guy die because of us?

02:40.475 --> 02:42.231
First name, Gil.

02:42.459 --> 02:44.369
Last name, unknown.

02:46.555 --> 02:48.377
Section Y-37.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.799
- No headstones?
- They just get a number.

02:52.028 --> 02:54.646
Of course, between the wind
and the snow...

02:54.875 --> 02:56.435
There's nothing.

02:57.499 --> 02:58.743
Friend of yours?

03:03.708 --> 03:07.483
He might be one of these in here.
I think we buried them last.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:13.371 --> 04:14.320
Ah, Mark.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.654
- I was reminding Kerry that today...
- Is Prospective Intern Day.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.565
- How could I forget?
- There are six 4th-year students...

04:20.795 --> 04:22.322
...interviewing upstairs.

04:22.555 --> 04:24.977
They're being hotly recruited
by other programs.

04:25.211 --> 04:28.178
I expect you to show them what
a real ER is all about.

04:28.411 --> 04:29.720
We'll do our best.

04:29.947 --> 04:31.158
I'm sure you will.

04:33.948 --> 04:35.671
- Can we talk to you?
- What's up?

04:35.868 --> 04:37.078
This.

04:37.307 --> 04:38.714
We won't take the fall for this.

04:38.939 --> 04:42.256
Negotiations are going our way. A temp
made a mistake. It's not our fault.

04:42.523 --> 04:45.011
- What temp?
- The one who gave the wrong blood.

04:45.275 --> 04:48.308
It wasn't a temp. It was me.
God, they lied to me!

04:48.539 --> 04:51.922
I filed an incident report,
and they said that was the end of it.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.388
Need a hand back here!

04:54.939 --> 04:58.255
15-year-old male. Multiple GSWs
to the chest. Massive blood loss.

04:58.491 --> 05:00.433
- He shot my partner!
- BP's 50 palp.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.450
Pulse 130. Two liters saline
in transit. O-2, 15 liters.

05:03.675 --> 05:04.787
- Got a name?
- Hernandez.

05:05.020 --> 05:08.565
- Who's bringing up the rear?
- 58-year-old male. Single GSW.

05:08.763 --> 05:11.894
BP 130 over 90. Pulse 108.
Resp 26.

05:12.123 --> 05:13.847
- Help the boy!
- Don't listen to him!

05:14.107 --> 05:15.962
- We'll help both of you.
- Let me just...

05:16.188 --> 05:19.930
We need you to wait outside.
We gotta work on your partner.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.096
- Just give us some room.
- On two!

05:25.403 --> 05:26.166
Need suction.

05:26.396 --> 05:29.046
Decreased breath on the right side.
I need to intubate.

05:29.276 --> 05:30.869
Pressure's down to 40 palp.

05:31.099 --> 05:32.375
Pulse 160.

05:33.275 --> 05:34.802
Lydia, draw the blood gas.

05:35.036 --> 05:38.003
- This'll teach him not to shoot cops.
- CBC, type and cross for a 6.

05:38.235 --> 05:41.050
Get O-neg going. Chest-tube tray.
Is Thora-Seal ready?

05:41.243 --> 05:42.323
In a sec.

05:42.555 --> 05:43.483
I'm in.

05:44.347 --> 05:46.486
Tape that up for me, please.

05:46.747 --> 05:50.326
- I'll call Radiology for a portable.
- And Respiratory for a vent.

05:50.555 --> 05:52.442
I'm gonna go check on Doyle.

05:54.139 --> 05:56.757
CBC and a crit. Update tetanus,
give him one gram of Ancef.

05:56.987 --> 05:58.645
- How is he?
- Missed the femoral artery.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.631
- No neuro deficit.
- Excellent.

06:00.859 --> 06:02.200
Sergeant...

06:03.419 --> 06:04.794
...Mattimore...

06:05.019 --> 06:07.190
...welcome to the Purple Heart Club.
- Thanks.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.721
- How's the kid?
- We're working on him next door.

06:13.275 --> 06:14.737
I'm Jeanie Boulet.

06:14.971 --> 06:16.946
- Mike and Cindy Patterson.
- Have a seat.

06:17.179 --> 06:20.146
- I understand you've got a headache.
- Nothing serious.

06:20.411 --> 06:21.785
Do you have a history of migraines?

06:22.043 --> 06:23.734
- A few in college.
- These are different.

06:23.963 --> 06:26.167
- They come on for no reason.
- What caused them before?

06:26.779 --> 06:28.851
- Tubas.
- We were in the marching band.

06:29.883 --> 06:33.014
You're also suffering from insomnia
and dizziness. Anything else?

06:33.339 --> 06:36.209
- He just hasn't been himself.
- How so?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.740
Last night in his sleep, he bit me.

06:38.971 --> 06:41.459
And when he woke up,
he didn't know where he was.

06:41.915 --> 06:43.028
Let's take a look.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.656
- How's that kid who got shot?
- Well, he made it to surgery.

06:53.115 --> 06:54.162
Thank you.

06:54.683 --> 06:57.334
My mother was disappointed
you couldn't make it last night.

06:57.563 --> 06:58.992
Work, you know.

07:00.859 --> 07:02.769
My brothers are doubting
your intentions.

07:03.003 --> 07:04.497
All five of them?

07:07.259 --> 07:08.568
You first.

07:10.491 --> 07:13.208
I'm not sorry we did this.
It's been fun.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.372
But it's starting to interfere
with my work.

07:16.571 --> 07:20.761
I want to preserve our friendship.
I know that's important for you too.

07:23.131 --> 07:24.473
No hard feelings, right?

07:25.915 --> 07:26.930
Of course not.

07:31.739 --> 07:32.884
What did you want to say?

07:35.036 --> 07:36.083
Nothing.

07:43.035 --> 07:44.377
You hung me out to dry.

07:44.603 --> 07:47.450
- No, I didn't.
- Then who did?

07:47.643 --> 07:49.170
Let me get you a cup of coffee.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.028
I don't want a cup of coffee.

07:51.259 --> 07:53.593
- It wasn't me.
- Who then? Drummond?

07:54.427 --> 07:57.624
Somebody who wanted
to influence negotiations.

07:57.851 --> 08:00.153
And somebody who had access
to your report.

08:00.923 --> 08:03.290
Carol, we've got a threatened
work stoppage here.

08:03.547 --> 08:05.718
Emotions are high,
the budget's shrinking...

08:05.947 --> 08:08.500
...and your nursing staff
refuses to acknowledge...

08:08.731 --> 08:12.048
...the realities of 90s medicine!
- This isn't about the sickout!

08:12.283 --> 08:13.363
I gave him the wrong blood.

08:13.595 --> 08:17.489
Which wouldn't have happened if
your friends had shown up for work.

08:17.723 --> 08:19.992
This isn't labor politics, Mary!

08:20.187 --> 08:22.009
A man died.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.599
I'm sorry, Carol.

08:24.891 --> 08:28.786
I killed a man! And nobody
around here seems to give a damn!

08:35.995 --> 08:37.010
Tie.

08:38.171 --> 08:39.993
Peter? Tie.

08:41.755 --> 08:45.301
I think you're wise to slow it down
after Pediatrics.

08:45.531 --> 08:49.524
Nothing like a simple hernia
to put you in touch with the basics.

08:50.299 --> 08:53.168
Hand, blade, clamp, suture.

08:53.691 --> 08:54.804
Peanut, please.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.035
Carter, what's the difference
between a prostate and a garden hose?

08:58.299 --> 08:59.641
- I don't know.
- Let me tell you.

08:59.867 --> 09:01.842
There's a vas deferens.

09:05.403 --> 09:07.639
Corky Butterfield told me that one
back in the day.

09:08.059 --> 09:09.106
Good old Corky.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.981
He blew a gasket in the latrine
at Soldiers' Field.

09:13.211 --> 09:14.771
Met his maker with his pants down.

09:15.003 --> 09:16.018
Metz.

09:16.923 --> 09:20.119
Sometimes you have to step back
to reassess.

09:21.179 --> 09:25.205
It's a lot easier to take stock
from a nice, puffy blimp than an F-16.

09:25.819 --> 09:26.582
Right?

09:28.603 --> 09:30.905
That's the first mature breakup
of my life.

09:31.163 --> 09:33.552
- Congratulations!
- No histrionics, no yelling.

09:33.819 --> 09:36.503
- We saw the situation and addressed it.
- How'd she take it?

09:36.731 --> 09:39.698
She's hurting,
but she'll get over it in time.

09:43.930 --> 09:45.392
What time you got?

09:47.259 --> 09:50.555
I'd like you to meet Jay Musoff,
Whit Haskell...

09:50.779 --> 09:53.113
...Monica Campbell, Alex Ghandar...

09:53.339 --> 09:55.248
...Matt Collins and Leslie Wu.

09:56.379 --> 10:00.656
I've prepared an introductory packet
to our Emergency Medicine Program.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.778
Refer to it throughout the day.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.377
The ER may appear chaotic...

10:04.635 --> 10:08.280
...but if you watch closely you'll
see an organized system at work.

10:08.507 --> 10:11.322
- I'll take Jay, Whit and Monica.
- Fine.

10:12.187 --> 10:14.674
We'll start with the Admissions Desk
and go from there.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.841
If you wanna follow at a 10-minute
stagger, feel free.

10:18.459 --> 10:20.979
The heart of any emergency room
is the Admit Desk.

10:21.211 --> 10:24.211
Information is the blood
that courses through it.

10:24.443 --> 10:27.738
And the desk clerk is like
a tricuspid valve, if you will.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.841
So you guys want to play doctor?

10:30.075 --> 10:31.155
Let's go.

10:34.683 --> 10:36.690
I chase number one,
lose him down an alley.

10:36.955 --> 10:40.664
I come back just in time to catch
number two bleeding my partner here...

10:40.891 --> 10:42.451
...with a cheap.22.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.912
He doesn't even have his gun out.
So I cap the punk. Twice.

10:46.139 --> 10:48.692
You're lucky your partner
came back when he did.

10:48.923 --> 10:50.581
Two rounds, two hits.

10:50.811 --> 10:53.178
I couldn't believe it!
You should've seen his face.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.450
He was so surprised.

10:54.683 --> 10:57.203
What did he think I was gonna do?
Give him a hug?

10:57.435 --> 11:01.265
- Then when he saw the blood...
- You have to go now. He needs rest.

11:01.723 --> 11:04.243
- I'll wait outside, sarge.
- You go on home.

11:04.474 --> 11:05.303
I'll wait outside.

11:06.490 --> 11:07.221
Home.

11:07.995 --> 11:10.384
Bring me a chocolate frosted
in the morning.

11:10.651 --> 11:11.665
He can do that, right?

11:11.931 --> 11:14.648
- Lf he gets a dozen for us.
- All right.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.282
Take care of him.

11:19.035 --> 11:20.311
Talkative.

11:21.051 --> 11:23.604
Ten months out of the academy,
he thinks he's Dirty Harry.

11:25.211 --> 11:26.193
Why didn't you shoot back?

11:26.523 --> 11:31.160
32 years in the force. I've fired
twice outside the practice range.

11:31.354 --> 11:33.209
A cop who won't use his gun.
That's a first.

11:35.515 --> 11:36.725
Your arm okay?

11:37.403 --> 11:39.258
It's just a little sore.

11:39.738 --> 11:41.648
Carol, can I speak to you a minute?

11:42.618 --> 11:43.960
Be right back.

11:47.483 --> 11:49.076
We got a situation here.

11:49.307 --> 11:51.990
I spoke to Mary Cain.
She doesn't know who leaked it.

11:52.218 --> 11:55.088
- You believed her?
- Yeah, I did.

11:55.419 --> 11:58.615
We had an agreement on the table
to protect current staffing levels.

11:58.842 --> 12:00.184
Management just pulled it.

12:00.410 --> 12:03.345
They're gonna use this
to renege on the whole contract.

12:03.803 --> 12:04.664
Sorry to hear that.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.444
You had no idea they'd
use this incident against us?

12:07.675 --> 12:08.919
No, I didn't.

12:09.883 --> 12:11.738
What? You think I'm lying to you?

12:12.699 --> 12:14.160
I don't know anymore, Carol.

12:15.387 --> 12:18.486
You and management can fight
and tear each other's hair out.

12:18.715 --> 12:20.089
I've got a patient.

12:26.522 --> 12:28.311
Most interns send samples
to the lab...

12:28.539 --> 12:30.808
...without knowing what happens
once they're there.

12:31.035 --> 12:34.296
Let's pretend that we're
a urine sample and find out.

12:35.770 --> 12:38.137
Let's see.
Scalded foot in Curtain 2.

12:38.363 --> 12:40.435
That looks promising. This way.

12:40.795 --> 12:43.512
I've got a 25-year-old male,
headaches, insomnia...

12:43.771 --> 12:45.658
He's pretty young for a stroke.

12:45.915 --> 12:48.948
- What do you think?
- Encephalitis or a mass lesion.

12:49.179 --> 12:51.546
Let's do a CT.
Who's on for Infectious Disease?

12:51.803 --> 12:53.559
- Greg Fischer.
- Get him down.

12:53.914 --> 12:55.092
Hello, Dr. Greene.

12:55.322 --> 12:57.013
Sasha, what a pleasant surprise!

12:57.242 --> 12:59.926
Sasha's one of our 5-star chefs
in the cafeteria.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.162
- What's today's special?
- Bratwurst.

13:02.395 --> 13:04.337
Idiot busboy carries out bin...

13:04.570 --> 13:07.702
...of hot water. Shoom!
Right down my boot.

13:08.379 --> 13:11.728
I'd amputate, but I'm afraid
you'd put it on the menu.

13:11.963 --> 13:14.418
- Alex, first step?
- Assess the burn.

13:14.682 --> 13:16.209
Leslie, what do you think?

13:16.475 --> 13:20.272
Partial thickness, and there's a small
blister below the medial malleolus.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.432
Good.

13:21.691 --> 13:23.251
Matt, what's next?

13:23.578 --> 13:26.895
100 of Demerol for the pain.
Then d Ábride any broken blisters.

13:27.131 --> 13:27.894
Thermazine dressing.

13:28.122 --> 13:29.846
Correct. You snip...

13:30.650 --> 13:32.145
...you dress...

13:32.379 --> 13:34.386
...and you give the Demerol.

13:35.131 --> 13:36.341
I thought this was a tour.

13:36.955 --> 13:38.264
Consider it interactive.

13:42.170 --> 13:45.432
I'll check in on you later.
Let me know if you need anything.

13:47.066 --> 13:49.401
- Regards to Kenny.
- Will do.

13:50.683 --> 13:54.425
- You two know each other?
- I picked up her cousin for B and E.

13:54.650 --> 13:56.025
She doesn't seem to mind.

13:56.251 --> 13:58.040
Best thing that ever happened to him.

13:58.267 --> 14:00.471
He's just like this kid who got shot:

14:00.699 --> 14:02.968
Young and scared,
gangs putting the heat on him.

14:03.707 --> 14:04.786
What happened to him?

14:05.019 --> 14:07.572
I got him into a work program.
You know what he is now?

14:07.803 --> 14:08.883
A locksmith.

14:11.099 --> 14:15.060
They used to have these dances here
called Blue and Whites.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.363
You know, cops and nurses.

14:17.594 --> 14:19.831
A lot of marriages came out of that.

14:20.091 --> 14:22.066
- Yours too?
- No.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.086
For me, it was always the job.

14:24.314 --> 14:26.169
You were probably just a lousy dancer.

14:26.426 --> 14:29.361
If I didn't have this hole in my leg,
I'd show you a turn or two.

14:29.595 --> 14:31.188
Thanks. I'll take a rain check.

14:31.419 --> 14:34.452
Do you know why so many nurses
end up with cops?

14:35.674 --> 14:37.016
Similar schedule?

14:37.723 --> 14:40.592
A shared appreciation
for life's vicissitudes.

14:41.563 --> 14:42.992
That's beautiful.

14:43.291 --> 14:46.008
Thanks. I stole it myself.

14:50.043 --> 14:52.181
- Too much coffee.
- Has that happened before today?

14:52.442 --> 14:55.377
Give me a break. I'm 58. I can't
have the shakes after I get shot?

14:59.259 --> 15:02.936
I thought only the scheduling nurse
was allowed to change the board.

15:03.162 --> 15:05.431
I like to erase my surgery
when I'm done.

15:05.659 --> 15:07.633
It gives me a sense of accomplishment.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.583
- What are you up to?
- Presenting a conference with Benton.

15:11.259 --> 15:12.884
There's a name I haven't seen
in a while.

15:13.114 --> 15:14.521
It's been a little slow lately.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.168
There's a splenectomy open
at 5:00 with Crosby.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.443
Why don't you sign him up for it?

15:19.675 --> 15:21.497
He usually signs up for surgery.

15:21.914 --> 15:24.729
Just because he's in neutral
doesn't mean you have to be.

15:26.587 --> 15:29.402
I'm doing a portacaval shunt later.
Care to join me?

15:29.659 --> 15:30.422
I'd love to.

15:32.027 --> 15:34.448
But I don't know what Benton
has planned.

15:35.258 --> 15:37.462
Judging by this, not much.

15:53.659 --> 15:54.586
I'm Dr. Ross.

15:54.842 --> 15:56.468
I'm Lisa Sayler.
This is my son, Benny.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.186
- You work for the hospital?
- Upstairs in ICU.

15:59.450 --> 16:02.647
I usually bring him to the clinic,
but I didn't want to wait.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.337
Okay. What happened?

16:05.147 --> 16:08.627
I'm not sure. He was out in
the back yard, and he hurt his elbow.

16:08.858 --> 16:11.444
Can you straighten out
your arm like that for me?

16:11.674 --> 16:13.747
You have to use his special name.

16:13.979 --> 16:15.767
- Which is?
- It's Clark Kent.

16:15.995 --> 16:17.817
- Hi, Clark.
- Hello.

16:18.971 --> 16:20.629
Let me straighten your arm out.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.057
Does that hurt? All right.

16:23.706 --> 16:27.002
We'll have to get some x-rays.
Anybody here have x-ray vision?

16:28.602 --> 16:31.319
Okay, we'll get Radiology
to take a look at it.

16:31.546 --> 16:33.335
- No idea how this happened?
- I wasn't there.

16:33.754 --> 16:36.088
But I think he was trying to fly.

16:38.106 --> 16:40.114
Ghandar, <i>Jeopardy</i> time.

16:40.347 --> 16:44.176
Tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox
indicates this common fracture.

16:44.410 --> 16:46.297
What is first-metacarpal?

16:46.523 --> 16:47.701
Navicular.

16:47.931 --> 16:50.931
I should try that on my students.
I teach third grade.

16:51.130 --> 16:52.340
That's nice.

16:54.459 --> 16:57.077
Heather, you have a medial,
collateral ligament tear...

16:57.339 --> 16:59.760
...otherwise known
as "gamekeeper's thumb."

17:00.026 --> 17:01.488
Playing goalie is hell on a manicure.

17:02.171 --> 17:03.861
- Hockey?
- Water polo.

17:04.090 --> 17:04.854
Coed.

17:05.594 --> 17:06.358
Sounds rough.

17:06.587 --> 17:08.856
Last year, took a shot to the face.

17:09.242 --> 17:11.544
Fractured my left orbit.

17:11.771 --> 17:13.657
It's a singles league.

17:14.107 --> 17:15.568
Swim and mingle.

17:16.089 --> 17:20.050
The guys I've met are tough outside,
but emotionally they're wimps.

17:20.378 --> 17:22.354
I guess my type is more...

17:23.963 --> 17:25.173
...the reverse.

17:34.394 --> 17:36.282
- Need some help?
- No, thanks.

17:36.539 --> 17:39.441
- I want to talk to you about that cop.
- Isn't he great?

17:39.675 --> 17:42.675
- My dad says he's a real legend.
- His right hand has a twitch.

17:43.034 --> 17:45.882
No head trauma,
no focal deficits, right?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.121
It's probably nerves.

17:47.355 --> 17:51.632
Well, I'd like a head CT to be sure.
The way his hand moves bothers me.

17:51.866 --> 17:54.255
I can't order a $ 1000 test
without indications.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.346
I think it's recurring.
He's hiding it.

17:56.570 --> 17:59.887
I'll do a neuro exam. If something
shows up, we'll scan him.

18:03.675 --> 18:05.617
Accommodation without
direct response to light.

18:05.882 --> 18:07.311
I'll dial Robertson.

18:08.219 --> 18:10.073
- Mrs. Patterson...
- Cindy.

18:10.843 --> 18:12.850
When did you notice the change
in Mike's behavior?

18:13.082 --> 18:17.621
A month ago, I found him in the kitchen
at 3 a.m. Talking to himself.

18:17.850 --> 18:21.112
It's possible you have a low-grade
infection in your nervous system.

18:21.338 --> 18:23.193
I'd like to do a spinal tap.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.177
That sounds painful.

18:25.403 --> 18:28.054
We'll give you local anesthetic.
Takes about 5 minutes.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.487
Can you get an L.P. Tray, please?

18:34.330 --> 18:37.909
- I've been meaning to call.
- That's okay. I didn't expect you to.

18:40.730 --> 18:42.072
3:00 conference. Thank you.

18:42.298 --> 18:45.332
Which leaves us plenty of time
for a splenectomy at 5.

18:46.394 --> 18:48.434
We'll be in and out by 6:30.

18:48.858 --> 18:51.989
- You signed me up without permission?
- Crosby needs someone to assist.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.153
- He does great work and respects yours.
- Take it off.

18:55.386 --> 18:57.808
- My name. Take it off the board.
- It's too late.

18:58.043 --> 19:00.083
Someone's going to have to cancel.

19:03.355 --> 19:06.322
The only sign of a fracture
is the fat-pad. Very slight.

19:06.587 --> 19:08.725
- Will he need a cast?
- The splint will be fine.

19:08.986 --> 19:12.728
He should heal in three or four
weeks. Can I talk to you outside?

19:12.986 --> 19:15.954
We're gonna be right back.
Okay? You just hang here.

19:19.098 --> 19:21.400
Has he always been
this uncommunicative?

19:24.986 --> 19:27.855
My husband died five months ago
in a car accident.

19:28.730 --> 19:31.381
He was taking Benny
to get an ice-cream cone.

19:32.890 --> 19:34.232
Was Benny hurt?

19:35.098 --> 19:38.775
But it took about 10 minutes
for the ambulance to get there.

19:39.034 --> 19:41.139
Benny watched his father die.

19:42.970 --> 19:43.733
I'm sorry.

19:46.395 --> 19:50.486
When he started to pretend he was
Superman, I thought it was healthy.

19:51.195 --> 19:52.471
A way of coping.

19:52.698 --> 19:56.888
I got him that costume for Halloween.
Now he wears it every day.

19:57.434 --> 20:00.729
Do you know Lyle Baker? He's a child
psychiatrist. One of the best.

20:00.955 --> 20:03.093
Why don't I have him come down
for a consult?

20:15.195 --> 20:16.755
Benny, come out, please.

20:17.178 --> 20:20.178
- How long will it take to heal?
- About six weeks.

20:20.410 --> 20:22.068
There go the playoffs.

20:22.619 --> 20:24.506
I don't know what I'll do with myself.

20:26.394 --> 20:27.955
Would you like to go out sometime?

20:32.794 --> 20:35.347
That brings up an interesting issue.

20:36.475 --> 20:39.060
Are doctors supposed to date patients?

20:39.674 --> 20:40.470
Definitely not.

20:41.658 --> 20:43.763
- For my protection, right?
- Right.

20:44.026 --> 20:45.936
What if you weren't my doctor?

20:47.098 --> 20:48.276
That's hypothetical.

20:49.978 --> 20:51.123
When do you get off?

20:52.187 --> 20:53.267
Six o'clock.

20:53.499 --> 20:54.808
So hypothetically...

20:55.194 --> 20:58.543
...if I were at Finch's Bar
on Dearborn tonight at 6:30...

20:58.778 --> 21:01.778
...and you just happened to come in
and have a drink...

21:02.010 --> 21:04.912
...that would be legal, right?

21:05.242 --> 21:07.609
Hypothetically.
If I weren't your doctor.

21:10.171 --> 21:12.821
You know, this thumb
is starting to hurt again.

21:13.403 --> 21:15.191
I think I'd like to see a specialist.

21:19.163 --> 21:19.926
Sorry.

21:20.538 --> 21:22.578
- Ever seen an abscess this big?
- Never.

21:22.810 --> 21:25.461
It's extraordinary.
Mr. Cliffe, how did this happen?

21:25.690 --> 21:27.828
I'm building a cabin up north.

21:28.059 --> 21:30.230
No plumbing yet. Just an outhouse.

21:30.458 --> 21:33.142
I sat down on the seat
without noticing the ice.

21:33.370 --> 21:34.897
When I stood up...

21:35.131 --> 21:37.465
That would account
for the wide extension.

21:37.690 --> 21:40.112
We need to drain. Eleven-blade.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.537
Not to worry, Mr. Cliffe.

21:43.771 --> 21:45.745
Relief is on the way.

21:48.698 --> 21:50.673
My two favorite ladies!

21:50.938 --> 21:52.400
Still trying to charm us.

21:52.667 --> 21:54.260
They said man would never fly.

21:54.490 --> 21:56.977
Now they have Air Jordan
on a mission to Mars.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.616
Nurse Hathaway told me about the
problem you're having with your hand.

22:02.138 --> 22:03.087
She did, did she?

22:03.323 --> 22:06.671
I'm sure it's not serious, but I'd
like to do a neurological exam.

22:06.906 --> 22:09.459
I want you to squeeze
my fingers when I say so.

22:10.907 --> 22:12.914
I got shot in the leg.

22:13.338 --> 22:15.094
The rest of me is fine.

22:15.322 --> 22:16.566
We just want to make sure.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.899
- No, thanks.
- It'll only take a minute.

22:19.162 --> 22:20.056
I don't want it.

22:20.314 --> 22:23.412
- It's for your own good.
- I said I don't want it.

22:27.130 --> 22:28.690
The man doesn't want it.

22:37.498 --> 22:38.446
Carla?

22:42.394 --> 22:43.408
What are you doing here?

22:43.610 --> 22:44.690
Waiting.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.024
What's wrong? You sick?

22:47.322 --> 22:48.500
What's wrong?

22:48.986 --> 22:51.059
We should probably talk later, Peter.

22:51.322 --> 22:52.632
- Carla Reece?
- That's me.

22:52.858 --> 22:54.767
Dr. Coburn will see you now.

22:55.610 --> 22:57.465
Coburn? OB?

22:58.907 --> 23:00.597
I'll call you later.
I promise.

23:02.426 --> 23:04.248
What's up? You pregnant?

23:05.082 --> 23:06.642
Later, all right?

23:14.714 --> 23:16.754
When Kerry asked me to talk to you,
I thought:

23:16.986 --> 23:19.223
"What's a grizzled old muckety-muck...

23:19.450 --> 23:21.784
...have to say to the next generation
of sawbones?"

23:22.042 --> 23:25.555
Then I realized, nope,
everyone has a tale to tell.

23:25.818 --> 23:29.975
And mine begins in a cold, little
farmhouse in Kubane, North Dakota.

23:30.458 --> 23:33.044
Pa Morgenstern worked
at the local tannery.

23:33.274 --> 23:35.379
- Ma was a taxidermist...
- How are they holding up?

23:35.610 --> 23:37.399
Stick a fork in them.
They've been "Weavered."

23:37.626 --> 23:40.211
- Still no sign of Superman.
- Thanks, Malik. Keep looking.

23:40.442 --> 23:41.685
What is that smell?

23:41.914 --> 23:43.375
Bratwurst, on the house.

23:43.610 --> 23:45.999
Compliments of Sasha,
the cafeteria guy.

23:46.234 --> 23:48.755
Remind me not to cure him again.
What do you think?

23:48.954 --> 23:52.664
About dating a patient, <i>Exxon Valdez</i>
ring a bell? I'm still holding.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.897
- You should talk.
- This is new territory.

23:55.162 --> 23:56.536
It takes time to learn the signs.

23:56.762 --> 23:59.096
I know the difference between
dependence and mutual attraction.

23:59.322 --> 24:01.526
- So what are you gonna do about it?
- Doyle.

24:01.754 --> 24:05.267
Gamekeeper's thumb in 4. Check the
splint. If it's set, discharge her.

24:05.498 --> 24:06.447
Roger that.

24:07.226 --> 24:09.397
Lisa? Yeah. Not yet.

24:09.626 --> 24:12.343
He didn't get past Security,
so he's still in the building.

24:13.306 --> 24:16.437
Stay put. He knows where you work.
He'll probably head your way.

24:16.666 --> 24:17.844
Great. Bye.

24:18.266 --> 24:21.081
When I held that dying mole rat
in my hand...

24:21.306 --> 24:24.154
...when I felt its little heart
pitter-pattering in my hands...

24:24.378 --> 24:27.542
- Do you see it?
- It's glowing. Looks like syphilis.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.811
Neurosyphilis.

24:30.074 --> 24:33.270
- I'm surprised.
- Imagine how surprised she'll be.

24:33.498 --> 24:35.320
How are we gonna tell them?

24:35.546 --> 24:36.975
We don't tell them.

24:37.274 --> 24:39.282
- We tell him.
- And not her?

24:39.514 --> 24:41.969
It's his disease.
We can't violate his right to privacy.

24:42.202 --> 24:45.235
And she has no rights except
the right to be infected?

24:45.466 --> 24:48.434
- Why don't I talk to him?
- I asked you down on a consult.

24:48.666 --> 24:52.495
This is a tricky situation.
I have more experience in these matters.

24:52.698 --> 24:55.545
It's my field. I've dealt with these
situations hundreds of times.

24:55.770 --> 24:57.112
This kind of thing can kill a marriage.

24:57.338 --> 24:58.549
So can silence.

25:20.858 --> 25:22.265
Dr. Carter?

25:22.522 --> 25:23.667
Are you aware of the time?

25:23.898 --> 25:25.753
I was waiting for Dr. Benton.

25:25.978 --> 25:28.345
The entire surgical staff
is already here.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.228
Anytime now, doctor.

25:39.386 --> 25:40.979
When were you gonna tell me?

25:41.690 --> 25:44.057
When I knew I had something to tell.

25:44.281 --> 25:46.703
My sisters had miscarriages
in their first trimesters.

25:46.938 --> 25:48.564
What did Coburn say?

25:49.306 --> 25:52.023
She said that it was just
some spotting...

25:52.250 --> 25:53.811
...nothing to worry about.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.465
I don't understand.
We were careful.

25:57.274 --> 26:00.176
It's like they say,
nothing is 100% effective.

26:00.410 --> 26:02.232
And you're sure it's mine?

26:04.794 --> 26:06.256
I'm gonna forget you said that.

26:06.522 --> 26:08.943
I'm gonna lay it on the stress
and surprise.

26:09.210 --> 26:12.723
I'm sorry. Look, honey...
What am I supposed to say?

26:14.106 --> 26:16.048
We're two very different
people, Peter.

26:16.282 --> 26:20.024
And Lord knows we both have enough
going on in our lives.

26:25.946 --> 26:28.019
I've made the choice, Peter...

26:29.049 --> 26:30.805
...to have this baby.

26:32.474 --> 26:33.881
All right.

26:34.746 --> 26:37.234
What do you expect from me, Carla?

26:37.882 --> 26:39.060
The truth.

26:39.482 --> 26:41.621
You've always been honest
with me.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.988
It's one of your finer qualities.

26:46.394 --> 26:48.401
I've gotta get back to work.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.152
I'll call you. All right?

26:52.697 --> 26:53.843
Sure.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.233
You can adjust these
if they're too short.

27:01.466 --> 27:04.313
They'll probably discharge you today.
You could use the practice.

27:04.538 --> 27:06.742
Stop being so nice.

27:07.642 --> 27:10.544
It makes me feel even more foolish
for speaking the way I did.

27:12.026 --> 27:15.125
You know, when I was in the alley
with the kid...

27:15.354 --> 27:16.466
...Hernandez...

27:17.786 --> 27:21.102
I've had guns pulled on me a dozen
times. This wasn't a hard guy.

27:21.338 --> 27:23.378
This was a kid caught in the deep end.

27:23.866 --> 27:27.249
30 more seconds. He drops that piece,
we both walk out of there.

27:27.578 --> 27:28.592
What happened?

27:30.458 --> 27:32.313
My hand jerked.

27:32.954 --> 27:34.710
He thought I was going for my gun.

27:34.937 --> 27:38.254
In a second, he had to decide
whether he wanted to live or die.

27:39.385 --> 27:41.393
Does anyone else know about your hand?

27:41.657 --> 27:42.934
You mean the department?

27:43.738 --> 27:46.072
They'd put me in the mailroom.

27:46.330 --> 27:49.843
Then who deals with the next kid
who panics and pulls a piece?

27:50.074 --> 27:51.601
Some hotshot like Pino.

27:51.834 --> 27:53.776
You need to get it checked out.

27:54.266 --> 27:55.160
What is it?

27:56.698 --> 27:58.935
Is it Parkinson's?
Is it a brain tumor?

27:59.162 --> 28:01.977
I don't know. But those
are treatable disorders.

28:02.202 --> 28:04.755
You could have years to teach
the Pinos to be better cops.

28:04.953 --> 28:06.514
Or I could be here...

28:06.746 --> 28:09.429
...lying flat on my back
stuck full of tubes.

28:09.690 --> 28:12.243
Let me do a CAT scan,
find out what's going on.

28:12.506 --> 28:14.197
I'll tell you what, angel.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.117
I'll think about it, okay?

28:16.762 --> 28:17.656
Good.

28:20.186 --> 28:23.634
The aortogram confirms the unilateral
renal-artery stenosis.

28:23.866 --> 28:27.095
And treatment was via
an aortorenal-bypass graft...

28:27.322 --> 28:29.329
...using a segment
of the saphenous vein.

28:31.162 --> 28:35.472
Now, discussing the causes and
evaluation of surgical hypertension...

28:35.673 --> 28:37.910
...will be my colleague...

28:38.138 --> 28:40.472
...Dr. Peter Benton.

28:48.730 --> 28:52.624
Except that he was detained,
which is why he asked me...

28:52.858 --> 28:54.134
...to stand in for him.

28:54.361 --> 28:57.493
The surgically correctable causes
of hypertension include...

28:57.722 --> 29:01.038
...coarctation of the aorta,
Cushing's syndrome...

29:01.274 --> 29:04.056
...and pheochromocytoma.

29:04.282 --> 29:07.380
- What about Conn's syndrome?
- And Conn's syndrome, of course.

29:07.578 --> 29:10.033
- And hyperaldosteronism?
- That too.

29:10.266 --> 29:13.135
Wasn't a trial of drug
therapy warranted...

29:13.402 --> 29:15.377
...before surgical intervention
was undertaken?

29:15.641 --> 29:19.024
- Surgery carries a 1 % mortality rate.
- I see your point...

29:19.290 --> 29:22.606
What were the results
of the renal-vein renin assays?

29:22.969 --> 29:24.530
They were high. Very high.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.111
Of course. But what was the ratio
of affected to unaffected sides?

29:32.538 --> 29:33.716
That I don't know.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.472
Obviously not.

29:41.754 --> 29:45.366
Anyone know the difference between
a prostate and a garden hose?

29:46.009 --> 29:49.271
- Leave her alone!
- I should slap some manners into you.

29:49.497 --> 29:52.846
- You can't talk to me like that!
- What are you doing? Let go of him!

29:53.114 --> 29:55.602
I'm trying to talk,
and this kid starts kicking me.

29:55.834 --> 29:58.769
- You were being mean to her!
- Sit down! Relax!

29:59.162 --> 30:03.318
Call ICU. Tell Lisa Sayler we found
her son, and get Security down here.

30:03.545 --> 30:06.098
What is that?
What are you doing?

30:06.714 --> 30:09.136
- He was mean to her!
- He could've been mean to you too.

30:09.370 --> 30:10.897
- No, he couldn't.
- Yes, he could've.

30:11.098 --> 30:12.308
I have super powers!

30:12.537 --> 30:14.064
You don't have super powers.

30:14.297 --> 30:17.646
You're a 6-year-old boy. You live
with your mother in Hyde Park!

30:19.449 --> 30:21.075
You cannot fly...

30:21.338 --> 30:25.015
...and you can't attack grown men
who are arguing with their girlfriend.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.671
Are you listening to me?

30:33.657 --> 30:34.999
How's it going?

30:35.514 --> 30:38.416
Somebody who'll talk to me!
You must not have gotten the memo.

30:38.649 --> 30:41.202
I read the paper.
Are you hanging in there?

30:41.433 --> 30:44.019
By a thread. The nurses
think I'm Benedict Arnold.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.901
Management's using my mistake
to make the RNs look bad.

30:47.130 --> 30:48.504
You're in a tough spot.

30:51.962 --> 30:54.351
I should probably go
to the <i>Sun-Times</i> myself.

30:54.617 --> 30:56.592
Tell them the death had nothing to do
with the sickout.

30:56.858 --> 30:58.035
Then what happens?

30:58.682 --> 31:00.056
I don't know.

31:00.793 --> 31:02.681
Lose my job maybe.

31:03.769 --> 31:05.198
You ready for that?

31:11.258 --> 31:12.021
Good news?

31:12.249 --> 31:14.486
I need to speak to your husband alone.

31:14.681 --> 31:16.023
Why? What's wrong?

31:17.434 --> 31:19.441
Show Mrs. Patterson
to the waiting room.

31:19.674 --> 31:20.884
I want to stay with you, Mike.

31:21.114 --> 31:22.902
- Does she have to?
- Only if you want.

31:23.161 --> 31:25.649
- I want to stay.
- I want her to stay.

31:27.673 --> 31:30.488
This is sensitive information.
It can be difficult to hear.

31:30.745 --> 31:32.501
I want my wife here with me, okay?

31:34.714 --> 31:35.510
All right.

31:35.738 --> 31:37.167
If that's your decision.

31:38.937 --> 31:41.304
Our tests show that
you have neurosyphilis...

31:41.530 --> 31:46.167
...which can cause mild personality
disorders like you've been suffering.

31:46.650 --> 31:48.373
- Syphilis?
- Neurosyphilis.

31:48.602 --> 31:49.911
It's sexually transmitted.

31:50.138 --> 31:52.025
That doesn't mean it was
contracted recently.

31:52.250 --> 31:55.862
It takes 7 years for symptoms
to arise after the initial infection.

31:56.761 --> 31:59.631
We've been together since high school.

31:59.897 --> 32:03.410
We've always been committed to each
other from the day we met to now.

32:03.641 --> 32:05.397
We can treat you
with IV antibiotics...

32:05.626 --> 32:08.113
...check Cindy for exposure.
In 2 weeks you'll be as good as new.

32:08.345 --> 32:11.542
This is impossible.
We've only been with each other.

32:18.841 --> 32:20.467
I'm sorry.

32:35.769 --> 32:39.152
35-year-old male, MVA.
Car skidded into a light pole.

32:39.386 --> 32:42.135
ALOC. Multiple lacs.
GCS, eight at the scene.

32:42.362 --> 32:45.209
BP's 90 over 60.
Pulse is 110, irregular.

32:45.433 --> 32:47.538
We had to use the jaws to get him out.

32:47.770 --> 32:49.624
- Extrication time?
- Approximately 20 minutes.

32:49.850 --> 32:52.916
- No witnesses. No I.D.
- Clear, people. Stay back.

32:53.113 --> 32:54.390
Come with me. Come on.

32:54.617 --> 32:58.512
Fifteen liters, O-2. Two IVs,
normal saline. One liter in.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.239
All right, on my count.

33:00.506 --> 33:02.546
One, two, three, go!

33:04.314 --> 33:06.834
Ghandar, cardiac monitor.
What do you see?

33:07.065 --> 33:08.953
- Looks like PVCs.
- Pupils are sluggish.

33:09.177 --> 33:10.454
Good bilateral breath sounds.

33:10.681 --> 33:12.688
Lidocaine, 100 IV push.

33:12.921 --> 33:14.961
- Start a drip at 2 mgs.
- Should they be in here?

33:15.193 --> 33:16.754
My students, my call.

33:16.986 --> 33:19.441
Get a CBC, Chem-20, enzymes.

33:19.674 --> 33:21.649
Type and cross for 4 units.

33:21.849 --> 33:24.948
- Dr. Weaver, OD in Curtain 4.
- We've got a gusher.

33:25.178 --> 33:27.414
- Piggyback a gram of Ancef.
- He's in fib.

33:27.642 --> 33:29.747
Charge to 200. Wu, put gloves on.

33:30.010 --> 33:31.602
Ever bring somebody back to life?

33:31.865 --> 33:33.840
All right. Get over here.

33:35.770 --> 33:36.718
Clear?

33:37.946 --> 33:38.928
There you go.

33:39.449 --> 33:40.791
Charge to 300.

33:41.434 --> 33:42.416
Clear.

33:43.737 --> 33:44.752
Charging. 360.

33:46.298 --> 33:47.476
Clear.

33:48.089 --> 33:50.261
Excellent.

33:51.161 --> 33:52.176
All right. Collins...

33:52.825 --> 33:55.924
...put in a Foley.
Don't be shy. It's not yours.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.365
Ghandar, glove up.

33:58.010 --> 34:00.050
You'll help me with
the peritoneal lavage.

34:00.282 --> 34:03.577
- Doug, how's that leg?
- Nasty. He got the popliteal artery.

34:07.866 --> 34:09.076
Dr. Ross.

34:11.898 --> 34:13.840
Benny, what are you doing in here?

34:16.058 --> 34:18.228
Haleh, get him out of here, please.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.213
Spiked a liter for the lavage...

34:20.442 --> 34:23.376
Come on, Benny. Come on.
That's it, come on.

34:27.033 --> 34:29.815
- More four by fours.
- Grab that 5-inch ace.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.857
Where were you?

34:41.177 --> 34:43.511
- Oh, the firm conference.
- Yeah.

34:43.768 --> 34:45.395
I got crucified covering for you.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.862
- You shouldn't have tried.
- I didn't have a choice!

34:48.090 --> 34:50.063
We were supposed to do it together!

34:50.297 --> 34:52.085
You left me twisting in the wind...

34:52.313 --> 34:55.379
...and trashed my reputation
in front of every surgeon here!

34:55.770 --> 34:57.941
I'm sorry. All right?
Something came up.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.691
You're sorry and something came up.
That's your excuse?

35:03.001 --> 35:04.943
I've got a shunt with Hicks.
Do me a favor.

35:05.177 --> 35:09.203
The next time you feel the urge to ruin
my career, I'd appreciate a warning.

35:24.697 --> 35:27.086
- Tom Clayton?
- Carol Hathaway.

35:27.994 --> 35:31.027
- You want something to eat? Coffee?
- No, thank you.

35:31.546 --> 35:35.375
You're the nurse manager in the ER.
Is that right?

35:35.609 --> 35:37.911
- Do you mind if I take notes?
- No.

35:39.129 --> 35:41.911
- Is this gonna be on the record?
- Yes, it is.

35:42.906 --> 35:43.953
Here you go.

35:48.218 --> 35:50.454
Is that man going to die?

35:51.194 --> 35:53.649
Maybe. He was hurt pretty badly.

35:55.449 --> 35:57.336
Just like your dad, right?

36:03.897 --> 36:07.213
I was thinking about what I said
to you earlier, and I was wrong.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.527
Sometimes when you try to help
somebody and you can't...

36:13.753 --> 36:18.008
...it gets inside you and it twists,
and you wonder why.

36:21.017 --> 36:24.661
You should do what you think is right.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.923
And you don't let me
or anybody else stop you.

36:37.274 --> 36:40.056
It's been a long time.
I can't remember...

36:40.281 --> 36:43.380
...if Superman had a dad or not.
But if he did...

36:44.025 --> 36:48.117
...I know that he was very,
very proud of his son.

36:56.218 --> 36:56.981
Okay?

37:02.969 --> 37:04.758
Come here. Come here.

37:09.337 --> 37:11.279
I've never done this before.

37:11.513 --> 37:15.736
Really? This is exactly
the kind of thing you should be doing.

37:17.049 --> 37:19.831
So should I be worried about Peter?

37:20.057 --> 37:22.512
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb. It doesn't suit you.

37:23.385 --> 37:26.549
Is his emotional state
impairing his surgical ability?

37:28.185 --> 37:30.040
No, not that I've seen.

37:32.313 --> 37:36.536
I appreciate your loyalty.
But I want you to know...

37:36.761 --> 37:40.274
...if Peter can't use your talents,
my team can.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.117
Really? Are you serious?

37:44.953 --> 37:46.611
I'm almost always serious.

37:49.369 --> 37:51.825
- I need Mr. Patterson's chart.
- Why is that?

37:52.889 --> 37:54.711
I couldn't convince him to stay.

37:54.938 --> 37:58.680
Tricky situation. Are you going
to notify the Department of Health?

37:58.905 --> 38:00.214
It's the law.

38:00.698 --> 38:03.316
Why don't you wait and let them talk.
I'll give them a call.

38:03.545 --> 38:06.196
- He'll probably come back in.
- You refuse to give me his chart?

38:07.545 --> 38:09.552
It's my job to be an advocate
for my patients.

38:09.753 --> 38:11.247
It's your job to assist me.

38:12.441 --> 38:14.351
That's why it's called
Physician Assistant.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.092
Are you always this arrogant,
or is it just me?

38:21.305 --> 38:22.199
It's just you.

38:25.145 --> 38:27.415
I owe you an apology
for the other night.

38:27.641 --> 38:31.318
You don't want to date a woman who's
HIV-positive. You owe me nothing.

38:31.801 --> 38:34.289
- Did you see me zap that guy?
- I had my hands inside his chest!

38:34.521 --> 38:35.830
Unbelievable!

38:38.746 --> 38:40.306
Thank you. Bye-bye.

38:41.433 --> 38:44.978
Well, I want to thank you two
for taking care of our charges.

38:45.210 --> 38:46.486
What did you think?

38:46.713 --> 38:47.990
Frankly, I was disappointed.

38:48.217 --> 38:51.894
I found a general lack of enthusiasm,
inattention to detail...

38:52.153 --> 38:55.000
If I were you, I'd seriously
re-evaluate their applications.

38:55.257 --> 38:59.316
Don't worry, none of your students
applied for the program.

38:59.801 --> 39:01.045
On the other hand, Mark...

39:01.273 --> 39:05.070
...all three of your candidates
rank us as their top choice.

39:05.305 --> 39:06.832
You really reached those kids.

39:07.353 --> 39:10.702
Ever think of an academic appointment?
There's a tenured spot available.

39:11.321 --> 39:12.466
I never thought about it.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.032
It's clear your place
is on the faculty.

39:15.705 --> 39:17.428
- Really?
- Absolutely.

39:27.769 --> 39:30.769
Carol, I just got a call
from a <i>Sun-Times</i> reporter.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.270
He wanted me to confirm
some statements you made.

39:33.497 --> 39:35.668
I hope you did. They're all true.

39:35.897 --> 39:37.271
Why did you do it?

39:37.497 --> 39:40.367
If you have to ask,
you don't know me very well.

39:40.601 --> 39:43.568
- I thought we were friends.
- No, Mary. You're my boss.

39:43.801 --> 39:47.892
I lost a patient. I can't forget it.
Neither should you.

39:48.633 --> 39:51.284
Drummond wants to see you right away.

39:58.969 --> 40:01.555
Hicks offered me a position
on her team.

40:07.161 --> 40:08.754
I'm taking it.

40:09.049 --> 40:10.227
Effective Monday.

40:17.913 --> 40:21.688
A month ago, you would've ripped my
lungs out for going to another surgeon.

40:22.841 --> 40:24.597
Now you just stand there?

40:25.881 --> 40:29.329
Since when did I start caring
about what you do, Carter?

40:29.593 --> 40:30.738
Never.

40:31.929 --> 40:35.027
But now you don't care about yourself
or your reputation.

40:43.641 --> 40:46.990
I need an evaluation before
I can transfer to Hicks' team.

40:49.081 --> 40:50.161
You'll get it.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.994
You know, in that surgery today...

41:00.313 --> 41:02.964
...everything I did, you taught me.

41:11.737 --> 41:13.493
I'll try your winter ale.

41:20.857 --> 41:22.035
Mark Greene.

41:22.265 --> 41:23.443
Heather Morgan.

41:23.673 --> 41:25.396
- What happened to your thumb?
- Long story.

41:25.977 --> 41:29.458
I had to go to the hospital.
Saw this great doctor.

41:29.721 --> 41:32.569
- Hope he took good care of you.
- She, actually.

41:34.841 --> 41:38.386
- Can I ask you a hypothetical question?
- We can dispense with those.

41:38.617 --> 41:40.178
Absolutely.

41:40.409 --> 41:43.540
- Did you order those?
- They're from table 14 in the back.

41:47.609 --> 41:49.333
You bring them everywhere?

41:55.449 --> 41:57.587
These are the shifts for next week.

41:57.817 --> 42:00.949
There's a problem with Wednesday.
We only have 6 RNs scheduled.

42:01.177 --> 42:03.544
You may need to bring in a float.

42:03.769 --> 42:05.711
There's supply reqs,
a memo from Mary Cain...

42:05.977 --> 42:09.774
...and a note from Grounds that
2 parking spots have been reassigned.

42:10.041 --> 42:13.970
Don't go to the parking clerk. Go to
Webber. We won on this last year...

42:14.201 --> 42:16.110
...but I think now
they're getting serious.

42:16.505 --> 42:17.912
That's not my job.

42:18.617 --> 42:21.464
It is now. I've been suspended.
