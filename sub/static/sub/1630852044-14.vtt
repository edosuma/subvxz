- This is up in the 4 to 500k
a month range.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.307
I think we can hit that.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.842
- Is the price negotiable?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.511
- Well, I say everything
in life's negotiable.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.146
Make me an offer.
- Come on.

18:01.212 --> 18:02.780
- Open the checkbook,
and then negotiate.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.515
- Let me know if your clients
want to come see it.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.117
Then if they do,
I would probably tell you

18:06.184 --> 18:09.219
to bring them at,
like, 5:45, 6:00.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.254
- Yeah, I'd love
to bring them here

18:10.322 --> 18:11.923
for a twilight showing
with the view of the city.

18:11.990 --> 18:12.990
It's gonna pop.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.592
- I wanna sell it.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.660
- What do you think price-wise?
- 35 million?

18:15.727 --> 18:16.661
- Huh?

18:16.663 --> 18:18.864
- I have a buyer for real.
35 million.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.064
- 48 million.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.099
- Could we work on that?
- No.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.600
- We'll talk about it.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.101
- All right,
bring me some buyers, okay?

18:24.169 --> 18:25.235
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.171
Thanks for coming by.

18:27.173 --> 18:31.109
- Oh, my God.
Can you legally do this?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.311
- That crazy?
- That is wild.

18:33.378 --> 18:34.479
- Yeah.
- That is so cool.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.214
- And that's it.
You wanna nug?

18:36.281 --> 18:37.949
- Yeah, can I really--
- Okay, no, no, no.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.917

- How's it going?

19:13.652 --> 19:16.121
- I have had back-to-back
showings for the last few days.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.189
Skyline is currently
one of my favorite listings

19:19.191 --> 19:20.525
because I get to work

19:20.592 --> 19:22.860
with Gleb and Elena
from "Dancing with the Stars."

19:22.862 --> 19:25.596
<i>But the house was
in rough shape last week.</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:29.733

19:32.704 --> 19:34.605

19:43.116 --> 19:44.849

19:44.916 --> 19:47.084
- This is exactly why I wanted
to bring you guys here.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.019
I saw this house,
and I was like, perfect.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.454
- Yeah, it's very open--
- Sky lights everywhere--

19:50.522 --> 19:52.089
- It's very bright.
- Super open.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.357
- Yeah.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.292
- Exactly what we're
looking for, not dark.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.161
<i>- We're priced at $3,195,000.</i>

19:57.228 --> 20:01.098
<i>We've probably had close to
60 people through the house.</i>

20:01.100 --> 20:02.467
And I have no doubt in my mind

20:02.534 --> 20:04.568
that I'm gonna get
a multiple offer at this point.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.103
- So what do you think
about the offers?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.571
Like, do you think

20:07.639 --> 20:09.573
they're gonna be higher of
the asking price maybe, or...

20:09.641 --> 20:11.709
- Fingers crossed.
- I will say this.

20:11.776 --> 20:14.846
I do think we're going to be
receiving more than two,

20:14.913 --> 20:17.848
so that's why I decided
to put an offer deadline

20:17.916 --> 20:20.584
because then all of them
are gonna be forced to write

20:20.652 --> 20:22.853
and put something together
for us to look at today.

20:22.921 --> 20:25.522
It makes people feel like
if there's an offer deadline,

20:25.590 --> 20:26.924
there must be more
than one offer,

20:26.926 --> 20:29.227
so we should put
our best foot forward.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.728
- What time is their deadline?

20:30.796 --> 20:33.298
- That deadline is
in exactly 24 minutes.

20:33.364 --> 20:35.866
Once they are all coming in,

20:35.934 --> 20:38.769
Shelby is gonna deliver
the news of all of the offers.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.071
And then we can assess on
how we want to go back to them.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.473
And you know,

20:42.541 --> 20:44.408
I happen to be wearing
a particular pair of shoes.

20:44.476 --> 20:45.944
I don't know if you noticed.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.412
- Oh, wow, you came prepared.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.079
- Are you a dancer?

20:49.147 --> 20:51.015
- I mean, you know, I can do
a little hip hop and stuff.

20:51.082 --> 20:53.083
- Ballroom is nothing
like hip hop.

20:53.151 --> 20:56.087
- That's what I've heard,
but I feel confident that

20:56.154 --> 20:58.155
with a little lesson
from you guys,

20:58.157 --> 20:59.958
you know, while we're waiting.

21:00.025 --> 21:00.991
The fact that Gleb and Elena

21:01.059 --> 21:03.461
can not only be
in the same room together.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.030
- Ooh, wow.
- Okay.

21:05.096 --> 21:06.764
- Wow, okay.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.900
- But they're so cordial, which
makes my job so much easier.

21:08.967 --> 21:12.169
I mean, if I had to be my agent
during my divorce,

21:12.171 --> 21:13.403
I mean, that's like,

21:13.472 --> 21:14.906
definitely an uptick
in the commission.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.974
- You're gonna start
with your right foot back.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.444
We're gonna go one, and you're
going to continue forward two.

21:19.511 --> 21:20.912
- Oh, okay.

21:20.979 --> 21:25.115
- Right, so one and two
and three and four.

21:25.183 --> 21:26.517
- See, I got that.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.953
- The next one is called
cross-body lead with a turn.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.656
Start with the right foot back
and turn under the arm,

21:32.724 --> 21:33.725
and we're just gonna repeat

21:33.792 --> 21:35.659
but without a turn
so we'll come back.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.329
- You're very fast, Gleb.
Slow down a little.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.598
This--I'm old.

21:39.664 --> 21:41.166
- Okay, I'm just waiting
for those offers.

21:41.232 --> 21:43.433
I'm like, let's go.
We only have ten minutes left.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.202
- Okay.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.505
Typically, when I'm meeting
a client to discuss an offer,

21:47.572 --> 21:50.140
maybe I come to their house
or we have lunch.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.610
- Dip.
- Oh, God.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.078
- And up.
- Oh, God.

21:53.144 --> 21:56.480
In this case, I am going
to dazzle them with some

21:56.548 --> 22:00.084
of my dancing abilities,
which hooray for me.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.819

22:01.821 --> 22:03.353

22:12.931 --> 22:14.565

22:17.969 --> 22:21.339

okay.

22:24.976 --> 22:27.378
Okay, so Rob
is actually on my team.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.547
He had a client
that came in at ask,

22:29.614 --> 22:30.981
which is fine.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.584
Don't forget, we are going
to counter, and so for them

22:33.586 --> 22:36.420
to start at ask,
hopefully means they'll go up.

22:39.190 --> 22:40.657
- Okay.
- 3.25.

22:40.725 --> 22:44.462
- So he's $30,000 higher
than our ask price.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.797
Thank you, sweetheart.

22:46.331 --> 22:47.397
- Bye.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.199
- So it's good news?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.068
- Yes, so here's
what I think we should do.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.270
I'd like to send a text
to the agents

22:53.338 --> 22:55.140
that have submitted offers,
and I'd like to give Rob

22:55.206 --> 22:57.141
because he is on my team,
the courtesy of a call.

22:57.208 --> 22:58.542
You guys just dance
your little hearts out.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.077

- I'm sure you have.
We have several offers.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.696
We are asking everybody
to submit their best and finals

23:19.764 --> 23:21.331

because there are a few people

23:26.705 --> 23:28.573
that are bringing
better numbers.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.308
- I will give you this.

23:31.376 --> 23:34.879
This is not a come-up 15,000,
25,000 kind of game.

23:37.682 --> 23:38.983
- Bye.

23:38.985 --> 23:42.519
- All right.
So I've sent the texts.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.588

to get the best number,

23:46.858 --> 23:48.526
and if that comes
from Rob's client, so be it.

23:48.593 --> 23:49.627
- Right.
- If it doesn't--

23:49.694 --> 23:50.727
- It doesn't.

23:50.795 --> 23:52.529
- He loses.

how many offers there are,</i>

23:53.932 --> 23:56.267
<i>so I like to keep them guessing.</i>

23:56.334 --> 23:58.068
I mean,
the goal is to always tap

23:58.136 --> 24:01.606
into the buyers' paranoia
of losing the property.

24:01.673 --> 24:03.473

- Yes, I'll show you where,
my love.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.814
- Beautiful evening so far.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.482
- I'm so obsessed with this.

44:13.550 --> 44:15.284
- Wait, where did he even
find this, the Wonka?

44:15.352 --> 44:16.785
- It's all been put together

44:16.854 --> 44:18.288
for this beautiful event,
Freddy.

44:18.355 --> 44:19.989
- What are you having, pumpkin?

44:20.057 --> 44:21.290
- You need a drink of something.

44:21.292 --> 44:22.025
- Yeah, I need a drink.

44:22.092 --> 44:24.360
- Sometimes,
you have to take a risk.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.695
This is a risky listing.
It's a high price point.

44:26.697 --> 44:30.366
Yes, there's a limit for what
Los Feliz can take as in price,

44:30.434 --> 44:31.434
but let's push it.

44:31.436 --> 44:32.968
Let's have some fun.

44:33.036 --> 44:35.838
- What do you think of
the iconic price of this house?

44:35.906 --> 44:38.340
- It's pretty--the price
is iconic, I mean...

44:38.408 --> 44:41.010
- Do you know about the iconic?
Do you know what that's from?

44:41.012 --> 44:42.611
- You know,
he received an award,

44:42.679 --> 44:43.914
the iconic award, right?

44:43.980 --> 44:45.715
- No.
- Oh, my God.

44:45.717 --> 44:46.883
Trace, where have you been?

44:46.950 --> 44:49.519
- You guys know I don't--I
sell real estate, I go home,

44:49.586 --> 44:52.254
I sleep with my boyfriend,
I take care of my kids,

44:52.322 --> 44:54.324
and then I go and do the
same thing again the next day.

44:54.391 --> 44:56.659
- He called and said,
"I want my own award,

44:56.661 --> 44:58.127
even though
I'm not in the rankings."

44:58.129 --> 44:59.195
- Shut up.

44:59.262 --> 45:01.597
- And he said,
"I want my iconic award.

45:01.665 --> 45:03.065
Can you call it that?"

45:03.133 --> 45:06.469
- I'm ----ing iconic.
- Yeah.

45:06.471 --> 45:09.071
- I was actually coming here
to just act--you know,

45:09.073 --> 45:10.907
once again,
just congratulate him.

45:10.974 --> 45:12.776
- Congratulate him
on another overpriced listing?

45:12.842 --> 45:14.010
- You guys,
this isn't even overpriced.

45:14.012 --> 45:15.611
- No, it's so beyond.

45:15.613 --> 45:17.213
- No, it's so--
- Oh, it's grossly overpriced.

45:17.280 --> 45:21.083
- This is a $5 million house.
- No, don't be ridiculous.

45:21.151 --> 45:23.520
It is a $6 million house.
- Max.

45:23.587 --> 45:25.287
- Have you and Altman
squashed your problems?

45:25.355 --> 45:27.089
- Honestly, I haven't thought
about it very much.

45:27.091 --> 45:28.757
I mean, I think he--hopefully
he's forgotten about it.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.360
I don't know.
- What do you think?

45:30.427 --> 45:32.361
- That's why I was making
the joke when I was speaking,

45:32.429 --> 45:34.763
and I was like, iconic, and I
looked at him to see his face.

45:34.765 --> 45:36.632
- Oh, I didn't even
think about that.

45:36.700 --> 45:38.667
- But he was like,
he didn't get much of a nod,

45:38.735 --> 45:40.469
so I don't know, you know?

45:40.537 --> 45:43.840
- Very funny, I forgot
it was the iconic award.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.441
- The whole thing is
so ridiculous.

45:45.509 --> 45:48.110
We're both ridiculous.
I'm so over it.

45:48.178 --> 45:49.745
<i>I just want to move on,</i>

45:49.813 --> 45:53.048
give him a big hug,
and laugh it off.

45:53.116 --> 45:54.250
- Hey, what's happening?
- I don't know if you remember.

45:54.317 --> 45:56.652
From Arden, do you remember?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.721
How's everything?
You doing well?

45:57.788 --> 46:00.757
- You guys look amazing.
- [sighs]

46:00.759 --> 46:03.659
- Hi, dear.
Okay, Janet Jackson.

46:03.661 --> 46:05.661
- I know. We don't want
a nipple [indistinct].

46:05.663 --> 46:06.763
- You have a nip slip.

46:06.831 --> 46:08.265
- How are you, buddy?

46:08.331 --> 46:09.866
- All right, man, all right.
That's a--

46:09.933 --> 46:12.201
- You liked my iconic speech?

46:12.269 --> 46:14.403
- Yeah, yeah,
I thought it was pretty clever.

46:14.471 --> 46:16.138
- I said it so I could read
your face to see,

46:16.206 --> 46:19.475
like, if we laugh about it,
we cannot laugh about it.

46:19.543 --> 46:21.277
- Listen, I think a lot
of people are laughing.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.811
I just don't think
they're laughing with you.

46:22.813 --> 46:24.347
I think they're laughing
at you about it.

46:24.349 --> 46:26.416
<i>[tense music]</i>

46:26.483 --> 46:28.817
- You're not upset still?

46:28.819 --> 46:30.519
- I actually came here
to support you.

46:30.521 --> 46:32.155
- Yes, and I appreciate that.

46:32.222 --> 46:33.623
- And then you're making
a clown out of yourself again.

46:33.690 --> 46:36.426
So you know, if you want
to go there, we can go there.

46:36.493 --> 46:39.061
- You seem obsessive
about this iconic thing.

46:39.063 --> 46:40.763
- Really, 'cause--
- I'm, like, making a joke.

46:40.765 --> 46:41.897
- I didn't bring it up.
- It was a joke.

46:41.965 --> 46:48.071
- Everybody gets so ----ing
competitive about numbers.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.705
You pulling yourself
out of the rankings

46:49.773 --> 46:52.508
is like your thing to say,
like, I'm above it all.

46:52.510 --> 46:54.044
Him being number one,
congratulations.

46:54.110 --> 46:55.244
That's an accomplishment--

46:55.312 --> 46:57.179
- It doesn't matter if I
was one, two, three, or four.

46:57.247 --> 46:58.448
That's not what this is about.

46:58.515 --> 47:00.317
- That's what it's about.

47:00.383 --> 47:01.785
- It's a slap in the face
for everybody in the rankings.

47:01.852 --> 47:03.419
- The first year
you became number one.

47:03.486 --> 47:04.988
I become an iconic award.
- You're not iconic--

47:05.055 --> 47:06.389
- That's why you're pissed.
- You're a clown.

47:06.391 --> 47:07.857
- No, no, no, no,
the problem is--

47:07.924 --> 47:09.058
- It's shady.
We used to be friends.

47:09.060 --> 47:10.393
We used to be friends.

47:10.395 --> 47:11.827
That's why I'm so angry
about this.

47:11.895 --> 47:13.462
- I think you're being
a ----ing baby,

47:13.464 --> 47:15.464
to be honest with you.

47:15.466 --> 47:16.333
- You're a clown.

47:16.399 --> 47:18.801
- You're getting jealous
about an icon award.

47:18.869 --> 47:20.402
- Who are you coming in
like that?

47:20.470 --> 47:22.004
- I'm just being honest.

47:22.006 --> 47:23.138
- All right,
why don't you be honest outside

47:23.206 --> 47:24.908
and take a minute to yourself?

47:24.974 --> 47:27.076
<i>It's not about the rankings.</i>

47:27.143 --> 47:29.078
He's deciding that today,

47:29.145 --> 47:31.281
<i>Fredrik is now going to deny</i>

47:31.348 --> 47:35.484
him admitting that he ordered
his own icon trophy.

47:35.552 --> 47:38.154
- Yes, I wanted some sort of
like this mention

47:38.156 --> 47:39.722
that we are in the company.

47:39.789 --> 47:44.160
It just didn't feel right
when we are clearly so big.

47:44.162 --> 47:46.528
Josh Altman is making this
like a Fredrik thing.

47:46.596 --> 47:48.498
<i>I never asked for an icon award.</i>

47:48.565 --> 47:52.702
Julia, who's my CEO who runs
the entire nationwide team

47:52.769 --> 47:54.903
with me, spoke to the executives

47:54.905 --> 47:57.106
and asked for them
to be recognized

47:57.173 --> 47:59.575
<i>as being part of the company.</i>

47:59.643 --> 48:02.311
<i>The 86 team members
that have worked so hard</i>

48:02.379 --> 48:04.113
<i>in all of these markets
that we are in.</i>

48:04.181 --> 48:05.748
- Frederik, quick question.

48:05.816 --> 48:07.015
Let's just talk about facts.

48:07.084 --> 48:08.584
You called and ordered
your own award.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.954
- I did not call anybody
to order any award.

48:11.020 --> 48:12.788
- Douglas Elliman awarded
you an award.

48:12.856 --> 48:14.256
- No, no, no, no.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.726
- No, incorrect, he called
and ordered his own award.

48:16.793 --> 48:18.494
- What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

48:18.562 --> 48:20.529
- You're ----ing--you're
lying right now.

48:20.597 --> 48:22.865
You admitted to me
that you called up

48:22.932 --> 48:24.066
and ordered your own award.

48:24.068 --> 48:26.869
Am I lying right now?

48:26.871 --> 48:29.805
- Julia had a conversation
with them about recognition,

48:29.873 --> 48:30.807
not the rankings.

48:30.874 --> 48:34.544
You are attacking me over
and over and over again.

48:34.611 --> 48:35.878
- Just be real.

48:35.946 --> 48:37.279
- Okay, I'm gonna leave.

48:37.281 --> 48:38.815
- We liked the real
Fredrik Eklund.

48:38.882 --> 48:40.483
- I'm trying to sell a house.
I'm at an open house.

48:40.550 --> 48:43.353
- Well, this will never sell,
so it doesn't ----ing matter.

48:44.688 --> 48:48.925
I'm thrown.
I'm thrown off because he lied.

48:48.993 --> 48:51.293
He ----ing lied to me.

48:51.295 --> 48:56.398
You just stabbed our friendship
through the heart.

48:56.466 --> 49:00.570
Like, done.
We're done.

49:01.438 --> 49:04.306
- Could we please put this
behind us and laugh at it?

49:04.374 --> 49:07.377
- Just admit that you just lied
and that you guys did call

49:07.444 --> 49:09.445
for your own award,
and I'm done.

49:09.447 --> 49:10.947
I'll never talk about it
ever again.

49:11.015 --> 49:13.917
- I never lied.

49:13.984 --> 49:15.651
- I'll tell you one thing,
you know, what?

49:15.719 --> 49:19.188
Our relationship,
the last string is cut.

49:19.190 --> 49:20.923
I'm done with you, man.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.726
If you're going to be a liar,
there's no reason.

49:22.792 --> 49:24.060
I got everything
I need in my life.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.161
- Guys,
we're all--hold on, guys.

49:25.228 --> 49:26.528
It's pointless.

49:26.596 --> 49:27.663
- It's not worth it
for us anymore.

49:27.731 --> 49:28.865
- Listen--

49:28.932 --> 49:30.399
<i>- Everybody keeps telling me</i>

49:30.401 --> 49:32.901
that Altman seems
threatened by me.

49:32.969 --> 49:35.671
<i>I guess I have to start to agree</i>

49:35.739 --> 49:37.606
<i>because there's something
about me</i>

49:37.608 --> 49:39.107
that he just can't stand

49:39.176 --> 49:42.144
and is obviously
business-related.

49:42.212 --> 49:44.881
There goes that friendship.

49:44.948 --> 49:46.215
But I tried.
I tried.

49:46.283 --> 49:47.349
- All right, guys.

49:47.351 --> 49:50.220
- Can we--are you leaving?
Are you actually leaving?

49:50.286 --> 49:52.087
- There's no room
for fake anymore.

49:52.155 --> 49:53.622
I just don't need it.

49:53.690 --> 49:56.026

49:56.092 --> 49:57.693
<i>- Can we all grab hands?</i>

49:57.761 --> 49:59.261

I'm in my house.
I own this house with you.

51:24.848 --> 51:26.782
This is not Altman's turf.

51:39.062 --> 51:40.729
I'm a good person.

- No, I love it.

51:55.078 --> 51:56.278

- Oh, yeah, I like that.

51:56.346 --> 51:57.880
It's true actually.

My brother is my best friend

It's so--

52:04.422 --> 52:07.957
- Let's discuss the most
important question of all.

52:08.024 --> 52:11.026
