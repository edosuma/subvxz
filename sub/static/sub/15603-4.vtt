WEBVTT

00:03.618 --> 00:05.285
<i>- Eric.</i>
- Hi, Joan.

00:05.735 --> 00:07.269
You're up for
the DCS job, too.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.155
Can I just say that it's such
an honor to be working

00:09.239 --> 00:11.524
for the first woman
to be DCS?

00:11.608 --> 00:13.159
My name is Calder Michaels,

00:13.243 --> 00:15.194
and I'm the station chief here
in Medellin.

00:15.278 --> 00:16.695
Arthur, I know Teo
is your son.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.498
He's an undercover operative
inside ALC.

00:19.583 --> 00:22.001
Teo Braga is
a known terrorist.

00:22.085 --> 00:24.003
Shots! Shots!

00:24.087 --> 00:25.727
I could have killed
the entire delegation.

00:25.789 --> 00:28.490
And now the CIA
is specifically hunting you,

00:28.558 --> 00:31.961
from the local station chief
to the ex-DCS,

00:32.028 --> 00:33.679
a man named Henry Wilcox.

00:33.763 --> 00:35.283
I'm not looking for
a partner, darling.

00:35.298 --> 00:36.348
I think I've earned it.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.100
You've got to give me something,

00:38.167 --> 00:39.602
so I know we have a pact.

00:39.669 --> 00:42.188
Wendy and Xu Chen,
two Chinese nationals

00:42.272 --> 00:44.190
living in D.C.
who move billions of dollars

00:44.274 --> 00:46.675
for organizations like ALC.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.650
- Too high.
- Hey, I'm not aiming.

00:54.701 --> 00:55.951
- You should be.
- Because you think

00:56.019 --> 00:57.953
I'm vulnerable after
what happened in Colombia?

00:59.539 --> 01:01.707
I take it we're alone.

01:01.791 --> 01:03.859
Completely.

01:03.910 --> 01:06.045
Henry asked you
to take Teo off the board

01:06.129 --> 01:08.230
to prove that you're in.

01:08.298 --> 01:09.498
What are you going to tell him
when he finds out

01:09.566 --> 01:11.199
you decided to let him
go instead?

01:11.251 --> 01:13.552
I can take care of Henry.

01:13.637 --> 01:15.888
You start thinking that way
and you've lost already.

01:15.972 --> 01:17.389
You need a story.

01:17.474 --> 01:19.308
Henry is too smart to think
I'm really working for him.

01:19.375 --> 01:20.709
You still need a story.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.513
Okay, how's this?
I couldn't find Teo Braga.

01:24.564 --> 01:26.849
Cute, but lies will
trip you up.

01:26.900 --> 01:28.817
The truth is
easier to remember.

01:28.885 --> 01:31.070
Okay, I caught Teo.

01:31.154 --> 01:32.905
I took him to
a CIA black site.

01:32.989 --> 01:35.824
There was a breach in security,
and he escaped.

01:35.892 --> 01:38.277
All of which is documented
in Calder Michaels's report,

01:38.361 --> 01:39.778
which you're gonna need
for backup,

01:39.863 --> 01:43.032
'cause I guarantee you, Henry
has moles inside this building.

01:43.083 --> 01:46.168
That's our only play.

01:46.235 --> 01:48.621
You think I made us all
vulnerable by letting Teo go?

01:48.705 --> 01:50.572
You did what you did,
and now we need to contain it.

01:50.624 --> 01:52.341
Teo gave us a chance
to find out

01:52.408 --> 01:53.742
who funded the Solstar bombing

01:53.793 --> 01:55.261
when he gave us
Wendy and Xu Chen.

01:55.345 --> 01:57.913
We have to act on that.

01:59.582 --> 02:01.467
Wendy and Xu Chen,
two Chinese nationals

02:01.551 --> 02:03.251
living and working
here in D.C.

02:03.303 --> 02:05.854
He's a V.P.
at the World Bank.

02:05.922 --> 02:08.107
She is an attache
at the Chinese embassy

02:08.191 --> 02:10.592
with access to courier pouches
and diplomatic immunity.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.404
Their contacts called
a meeting.

03:45.488 --> 03:47.039
The best way to find out
who the Chens

03:47.123 --> 03:50.492
are laundering money for is for
me to get a lot closer to them.

03:50.543 --> 03:52.861
I just have one question--

03:52.912 --> 03:55.164
what made Teo tell you
about the Chens?

03:55.215 --> 03:58.333
I asked him for a piece
of intel, to prove himself.

03:58.385 --> 04:00.419
Why is it still so hard for you
to trust him?

04:00.503 --> 04:01.637
Until last week,

04:01.704 --> 04:04.056
he was still presenting
as a guerilla terrorist.

04:04.140 --> 04:06.708
He's Arthur's son,
and he saved my life.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.710
And you saved his.
Now you're even.

04:08.778 --> 04:10.929
Joan wants to see everybody.

04:17.853 --> 04:19.904
Good morning.

04:19.988 --> 04:22.908
Thank you for all your support
during this time of transition.

04:22.992 --> 04:25.077
As the new director
of clandestine services,

04:25.161 --> 04:26.745
it falls upon me to name

04:26.830 --> 04:29.615
a temporary replacement
to my former position.

04:29.699 --> 04:31.617
This person's
exemplary service

04:31.701 --> 04:34.620
to this department has
made my choice a very easy one.

04:34.704 --> 04:37.072
Everyone,
please congratulate

04:37.123 --> 04:40.209
the new interim head
of the DPD,

04:40.260 --> 04:41.576
Auggie Anderson.

04:45.156 --> 04:48.156

04:51.187 --> 04:52.888
Auggie, it's all yours.

04:52.939 --> 04:54.223
Thanks, Joan.

04:54.274 --> 04:55.590
All right, everyone,

04:55.642 --> 04:57.425
screens area in five.

04:57.477 --> 05:01.263
Congrats, man.
I mean, sir.

05:01.314 --> 05:03.565
Well, sir...

05:03.616 --> 05:06.201
I'll have to congratulate you
properly in private.

05:06.269 --> 05:08.620
Kissing up
to the boss already, huh?

05:09.789 --> 05:12.374
So, you already knew
about this.

05:12.441 --> 05:13.575
When did Joan tell you?

05:13.626 --> 05:15.244
She told me last night,

05:15.295 --> 05:17.445
but until she got confirmation
this morning,

05:17.497 --> 05:19.581
she swore me to secrecy.

05:19.632 --> 05:22.885
- Even from me?
- It wasn't my secret to tell.

05:22.952 --> 05:24.920
Still, it's a big thing.

05:24.971 --> 05:27.673
It would have been nice
to hear it from you, that's all.

05:27.757 --> 05:29.958
Being together can't change
how we work.

05:30.009 --> 05:31.810
I just don't want our jobs
to change us.

05:31.895 --> 05:33.178
That's what matters to me.

05:33.263 --> 05:34.344
I am so glad you said that,

05:34.397 --> 05:37.299
because I was gonna
have to quit.

05:37.350 --> 05:38.633
I don't want you to quit.

05:38.685 --> 05:40.903
Good, 'cause I just got
a promotion.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.654
The Chens live at
the Capitol Towers, Suite 508.

05:42.739 --> 05:45.324
Operative Walker
will be leasing 506

05:45.408 --> 05:48.827
and have a full array
of audio devices

05:48.912 --> 05:50.996
at her disposal that you all
will provide her

05:51.080 --> 05:53.815
as fast as humanly possible.
Now, unfortunately,

05:53.867 --> 05:56.251
we don't have the lead time
for a proper video installation,

05:56.319 --> 05:57.669
but we don't always need
to see things

05:57.754 --> 06:01.089
to make good intelligence
analysis, now do we?

06:01.157 --> 06:02.591
Now, Walker is gonna
be reporting directly to me

06:02.658 --> 06:04.510
as her handler until
other arrangements

06:04.594 --> 06:07.629
need to be made.
Questions?

06:07.680 --> 06:09.631
Hope you're not raising
your hands.

06:11.935 --> 06:13.802
So, how are you settling in?

06:13.853 --> 06:16.605
Yeah, I could use
a little more closet space.

06:16.672 --> 06:17.723
Mine is full of toys.

06:17.807 --> 06:19.441
Yeah, expensive ones.

06:19.508 --> 06:21.676
That tablet is
your master control.

06:21.728 --> 06:24.196
The Chen's apartment is laid out
basically just like yours.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.015
The wireless low frequency
sensors we placed should pick up

06:27.066 --> 06:28.483
most of the vocals
from next door,

06:28.535 --> 06:31.787
and we were able to put a camera
above the Chens' parking space,

06:31.854 --> 06:32.905
so at least
you'll be able to tell

06:32.989 --> 06:35.023
when they're pulling in and out.

06:35.074 --> 06:37.025
How is the rest of the place?
Oh, you know.

06:37.076 --> 06:39.494
Typical agency rental.
Yeah.

06:39.546 --> 06:42.214
I picked it, so I kind of
know how awesome it is.

06:42.298 --> 06:45.033
Check the music dock.

06:45.084 --> 06:46.835
You made me a playlist?

06:46.886 --> 06:48.220
Hey, by the way,
there is no landline

06:48.304 --> 06:49.671
into the Chens' apartment,

06:49.722 --> 06:52.224
and no record of any cell phone
in either of their names,

06:52.308 --> 06:54.843
so they're probably
using burners and alias accounts

06:54.894 --> 06:56.378
for their extracurricular
activities.

06:56.429 --> 06:58.213
- Travel records?
- Xu is a homebody.

06:58.281 --> 06:59.381
Hardly ever leaves D.C.

06:59.432 --> 07:01.233
Wendy has got
a diplomatic passport.

07:01.317 --> 07:02.851
Flagging hers
hasn't been as easy.

07:02.902 --> 07:05.053
I bet there's a Colombian
stamp on that passport.

07:05.104 --> 07:06.605
Has Teo ever met her
in person?

07:06.689 --> 07:07.773
He didn't say.

07:07.857 --> 07:08.991
Well, if he knows
the Chens' names,

07:09.058 --> 07:12.244
he probably knows more.

07:12.328 --> 07:13.745
They're home.

07:13.830 --> 07:15.747
Time to check the mail.

07:20.903 --> 07:22.070
Oh, 508?

07:22.121 --> 07:23.238
I'm 506.

07:23.289 --> 07:24.423
I just moved in today.
Annie Walker.

07:24.507 --> 07:27.459
- Hello, I am Xu.
- Xu, nice to meet you.

07:27.543 --> 07:29.678
Is this your wife?

07:29.745 --> 07:31.713
- Wendy.
- Wendy and Xu.

07:31.764 --> 07:33.382
I'll try to remember that.

07:33.433 --> 07:34.582
I've been on the sublet list
so long,

07:34.634 --> 07:36.385
I can't believe
I'm finally here.

07:36.436 --> 07:38.387
I don't even mind the junk mail.

07:42.725 --> 07:43.725
Where are you two from?

07:43.776 --> 07:45.611
- Oh, we are Chinese.
- Hmm.

07:45.695 --> 07:48.113
I knew I'd meet interesting
people in this building.

07:48.197 --> 07:51.316
What do you do?

07:51.401 --> 07:52.451
Oh, she doesn't speak English.

07:52.535 --> 07:54.453
Uh, tell her I'm happy
to meet her.

07:54.537 --> 07:56.321
I speak English well.

08:08.718 --> 08:10.618
Why don't you guys come in for
a glass of wine or something?

08:10.670 --> 08:12.287
You can tell me about who else
lives on the floor.

08:12.338 --> 08:15.790
- It has been a long day, so.
- Right.

08:15.842 --> 08:18.727
And with emails, it never ends.
Nice to meet you.

08:22.815 --> 08:25.133
Oh, I think I got something
of yours.

08:25.184 --> 08:27.135
Seems like a nice calendar.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.639
Thank you.
Good night.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.776
So, you have a 10am brief
on the Middle East

08:45.966 --> 08:48.950
An 11:00 with General Shrake
at the NSC.

08:49.002 --> 08:51.108
Lunch with Shellow
from the Pentagon--

08:51.109 --> 08:52.693
And it looks like
Eric Braithwaite is about

08:52.744 --> 08:54.078
to ambush me in the hall.

08:54.162 --> 08:57.064
Hello, Eric.
Joan, do you have a minute?

08:57.115 --> 09:00.785
For you, I've got three.
I'll be right in.

09:00.869 --> 09:02.253
What can I do for you, Eric?

09:02.337 --> 09:04.705
You made Auggie Anderson
interim head of the DPD.

09:04.756 --> 09:06.240
It's protocol
to consult Deputy Directors

09:06.291 --> 09:08.509
on a high level
personnel change.

09:08.576 --> 09:12.680
Well, I have no problem making
decisions all by myself.

09:12.747 --> 09:15.266
So, we're in for another
Campbell dictatorship, is that it?

09:15.350 --> 09:17.768
Eric, if you need a little
time to process the fact

09:17.853 --> 09:19.603
that I got the DCS job
and you didn't--

09:19.688 --> 09:22.128
Not everyone in this building
is on board with the palace coup

09:22.140 --> 09:24.275
that you and Arthur
are trying to pull off.

09:24.359 --> 09:26.760
My husband resigned.
He is no longer privy

09:26.812 --> 09:29.096
to anything that goes on
inside this agency.

09:29.147 --> 09:31.523
Then what is he doing
in your office?

09:33.002 --> 09:36.840
I'm sorry, Mrs Campbell but he
insisted on waiting inside.

09:36.865 --> 09:38.182
Don't worry, Olivia.

09:38.207 --> 09:41.207
My former husband seems
to have a way with women.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.727
- Will you close the door please.
- <i>Yes ma'am</i>

09:46.998 --> 09:49.283
Still the scorned wife
in public.

09:49.334 --> 09:51.969
Yet I'm the one wearing
the scarlet letter.

09:52.053 --> 09:54.088
You look good in this office.

09:54.139 --> 09:55.639
I knew you would.
What are you doing here?

09:55.724 --> 09:57.308
Filling out exit paperwork.

09:57.392 --> 09:59.593
Just want to save Olivia
the trouble.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.269
But I was hoping you would want
to keep this here.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.606
I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:15.577 --> 10:19.363
Joan, the baby has changed
everything for me.

10:19.447 --> 10:21.815
And not for me?

10:21.867 --> 10:24.451
I never would have done
any of this if I had known.

10:24.503 --> 10:25.586
I think you would have come up

10:25.653 --> 10:27.588
with something equally
as selfish.

10:29.758 --> 10:33.043
Teo is not dead,
and you are sitting in my chair.

10:33.128 --> 10:34.494
I think I did pretty well
for all of us,

10:34.546 --> 10:35.829
under the circumstances.

10:35.881 --> 10:38.465
I think you and I have
different definitions of a win.

10:38.517 --> 10:41.051
Henry wants to kill my son
and destroy your career,

10:41.136 --> 10:43.337
and I can't do anything
about any of it

10:43.388 --> 10:45.222
from my goddamn hotel suite.

10:45.307 --> 10:46.947
Arthur, you know you can't
come back here.

10:46.975 --> 10:49.059
Braithwaite is already
salivating at the notion

10:49.144 --> 10:51.278
of tripping me up.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.679
Don't let Henry under your skin.

10:52.731 --> 10:55.282
He is counting on us
overreacting.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.152
Oh, I'm not overreacting.

10:58.203 --> 10:59.703
I know what Henry is capable of.

10:59.788 --> 11:01.205
Well, then,
keep yourself together

11:01.289 --> 11:02.373
so we can fight back.

11:02.457 --> 11:04.909
Oh, I'm trying
to keep us together,

11:04.993 --> 11:06.360
because what's the point
of fighting back at all

11:06.411 --> 11:07.861
if I don't end up with
my family in the end?

11:07.913 --> 11:09.529
Our goals are
the same, Arthur.

11:09.581 --> 11:12.132
I'm just not ready
for this yet.

11:13.251 --> 11:16.086
I should have just said,

11:16.171 --> 11:19.373
"you look beautiful."

11:27.399 --> 11:29.049
Not exactly a welcome wagon.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.402
She said I was annoying
in Chinese.

11:31.486 --> 11:34.405
Well, not everyone falls for
your charm as easily as I did.

11:34.489 --> 11:36.574
And she threw
the calendar away.

11:36.658 --> 11:39.743
So much for getting that bug
inside her apartment.

11:39.828 --> 11:41.245
Hey, what have you picked up
on your sensors?

11:41.329 --> 11:42.613
Not much.

11:42.697 --> 11:45.032
She watches Bravo,
and he works a lot.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.252
Other than that,
they don't talk.

11:48.336 --> 11:50.070
Think that's what we'll be like
in 12 years?

11:50.121 --> 11:53.591
Well, if they are so happy
they no longer need words,

11:53.675 --> 11:55.593
then yes.
And by the way, you were right.

11:55.677 --> 11:58.429
Wendy Chen was in Colombia
12 days ago.

11:58.513 --> 11:59.964
Third trip in two months.

12:00.048 --> 12:01.581
Stayed in the same hotel we did.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.267
Right near the Banco Medellin,

12:03.351 --> 12:04.935
where the ALC keeps
their accounts.

12:05.020 --> 12:06.753
Mmhmm.

12:06.805 --> 12:08.022
It gets better.

12:08.089 --> 12:10.391
She met with the same guy
each time--

12:10.442 --> 12:13.027
Oswaldo, our dead friend
from the Orquideorama.

12:13.094 --> 12:14.395
The ALC banker.

12:14.446 --> 12:16.614
Now are you convinced
that Teo's intel is solid?

12:16.698 --> 12:18.616
I'm convinced the Chens are
a solid mark, so keep listening.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.701
Hang on.

12:21.769 --> 12:25.155
Yes, of course.
20 minutes.

12:26.774 --> 12:28.442
A call just came in
to Xu's cell.

12:28.493 --> 12:30.961
They're on their way to a meet.
I'm right behind them.

12:31.046 --> 12:32.446
Okay, good luck.

12:32.497 --> 12:35.916
I thought you said I was
the type who didn't need luck.

12:35.967 --> 12:37.117
You remember that?

12:37.168 --> 12:38.919
The first day we met?

12:38.970 --> 12:40.304
How could I forget?

14:12.764 --> 14:14.932
The money was delivered
as usual.

14:15.016 --> 14:16.600
We have no control
over the actions

14:16.684 --> 14:18.102
of a terrorist you hire.

14:18.186 --> 14:20.053
Your judgment
is severely lacking

14:20.105 --> 14:21.655
if that's the way you talk
about the business we conduct.

14:21.722 --> 14:23.723
We have a business
to protect, too.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.609
Our arrangement
is very clear.

14:25.693 --> 14:29.363
You move money for me,
you get rich, and you stay safe.

14:43.511 --> 14:45.796
I swear to you,
your money was delivered.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.415
No one knows who stopped
the bombing.

14:48.466 --> 14:49.800
And Puma is still alive?

14:49.884 --> 14:52.436
You have confirmation?
We heard he escaped a raid,

14:52.520 --> 14:54.555
but Eduardo was taken.
Who else knows?

14:54.606 --> 14:56.890
Nothing can be traced back.

14:56.941 --> 14:59.560
The banker is already dead.
We've become too exposed.

14:59.611 --> 15:02.613
Too many people know
too many things.

15:02.697 --> 15:04.148
I'm afraid our arrangement
is over.

15:04.232 --> 15:06.316
We tell no one,
and now you threaten us?

15:06.401 --> 15:09.453
I was about to offer you
a severance package.

15:09.537 --> 15:11.938
The freedom to start your lives
over in the Caymans

15:11.990 --> 15:14.324
with all the money
I paid you so far.

15:14.409 --> 15:17.127
In exchange,
all I ask is your loyal silence

15:17.212 --> 15:20.547
and any proof you may have

15:20.615 --> 15:23.834
of our business dealings.
A simple trade.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.172
Sound fair?

15:28.256 --> 15:31.225
- Yes.
- Good.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.459
Now, you go about your lives

15:32.510 --> 15:35.128
and I'll be in touch with
the details.

15:37.565 --> 15:39.483
Good night.

15:55.157 --> 15:57.279
The Chens are
Henry's conduit to the ALC.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.088
They discussed
the failed bombing,

15:59.089 --> 16:01.640
and Henry admitted
to paying for it.

16:01.725 --> 16:04.310
But all we've got is
a conversation in the woods

16:04.394 --> 16:07.146
that wasn't recorded.
We can't pick up the Chens now,

16:07.230 --> 16:09.431
any more than
we can pick Henry up.

16:09.482 --> 16:10.843
We can't even put pressure
on them,

16:10.850 --> 16:12.401
because she's
a Chinese diplomat.

16:12.468 --> 16:14.636
He wants them to disappear.

16:14.688 --> 16:17.523
If they're lucky, he'll actually
let them escape to the Caymans.

16:17.607 --> 16:19.825
If they're not, we won't have
this chance again.

16:19.909 --> 16:21.076
You want to try and turn her?

16:21.144 --> 16:23.278
Wendy is smart enough
to be afraid of Henry,

16:23.330 --> 16:24.830
and fear is a wedge.

16:24.914 --> 16:26.782
And if you can't convince her,
and she goes back to Henry

16:26.833 --> 16:29.535
and tells him about her new
blonde neighbor from the CIA?

16:29.619 --> 16:31.486
We can't keep
playing defense anymore.

16:31.538 --> 16:32.588
We have an opportunity.

16:32.655 --> 16:35.824
Either we take it
or we lose it.

16:38.345 --> 16:41.663
- It's your call, Auggie.
- All right.

16:41.715 --> 16:43.599
We use our assets
to watch them at work

16:43.666 --> 16:45.517
in case Henry approaches
them there.

16:45.602 --> 16:46.685
You continue your surveillance

16:46.770 --> 16:48.687
at the apartment,
but nothing more.

16:53.309 --> 16:54.676
Henry is gonna have them,

16:54.728 --> 16:55.978
and whatever proof
they have against him,

16:56.029 --> 16:57.229
if we don't act now.

16:57.313 --> 16:59.948
Keep following them,
just don't approach.

17:00.016 --> 17:02.618
If we move too soon,
we'll scare him off.

17:04.621 --> 17:06.872
Okay.

17:06.955 --> 17:08.857
Auggie...

17:08.907 --> 17:10.387
You can't change the rules
for her now

17:10.460 --> 17:12.027
just because of the way
you feel.

17:12.078 --> 17:15.696
My feelings haven't changed,
just my job.

17:56.339 --> 18:00.092
High noon.
Worst sun of the day.

18:00.176 --> 18:04.079
I hear it's particularly brutal
near the equator.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.180
How was your trip?

18:05.248 --> 18:07.266
My trip was successful.

18:07.350 --> 18:08.711
Really?
Because I thought we agreed

18:08.718 --> 18:12.521
you'd take care of Teo Braga,
and you didn't.

18:12.588 --> 18:14.106
I caught Teo Braga.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.358
I had him at a CIA black site.

18:16.425 --> 18:17.759
Go on.

18:17.811 --> 18:21.447
- There was a security breach.
- And he escaped?

18:21.531 --> 18:23.866
No.

18:23.933 --> 18:27.069
I let him go.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.441
A curious way
to take care of him.

18:28.488 --> 18:32.157
You wanted me to stop
a terrorist attack, and I did.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.743
Because I let him go,
he led me right to it.

18:34.794 --> 18:36.628
If I had killed him,
I would have failed.

18:36.713 --> 18:39.131
You restore my faith in gray
every time we meet.

18:39.215 --> 18:41.717
Why did you say this wouldn't
end well for Auggie?

18:41.784 --> 18:43.952
There it is.

18:44.003 --> 18:46.505
That's the reason you let me
court you in the first place.

18:46.589 --> 18:49.508
You're afraid that if I'm right
about Arthur being corrupt,

18:49.592 --> 18:53.725
you might not know the man you
sleep next too as well as you thought.

18:55.932 --> 18:57.316
There's a six month gap

18:57.400 --> 19:01.469
in Auggie Anderson's
CIA service record,

19:01.521 --> 19:02.688
right around the time

19:02.772 --> 19:05.473
he opened that account
for Arthur in Colombia.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.985
Just keep yourself covered.

19:17.036 --> 19:20.122
The sun can be very dangerous
if you're not protected.

19:25.712 --> 19:27.796
That wasn't the story
we agreed on.

19:27.847 --> 19:29.965
If Henry is gonna play games,
I'm gonna play back.

19:30.016 --> 19:32.885
But you're used to rules.
His game doesn't have any.

19:32.969 --> 19:35.354
He'll use anything against you.
Or you.

19:35.438 --> 19:38.223
Where were you
for six months in 2006?

19:42.345 --> 19:43.612
What?

19:43.679 --> 19:45.680
Henry said there's a gap
in your transcript?

19:45.732 --> 19:47.649
Is this why
you brought me here?

19:47.700 --> 19:49.484
To play into the wedge
that Henry has been trying

19:49.536 --> 19:51.203
to create between us
since he gave you that file?

19:51.287 --> 19:52.905
We can't talk about this
inside the building

19:52.989 --> 19:54.957
because Henry still has
people there.

19:55.024 --> 19:57.209
If it's not true,
why didn't you just deny it?

20:01.164 --> 20:04.666
You've been on edge ever since
I went back to find Teo.

20:04.717 --> 20:06.534
I know there is something
you're not telling me.

20:06.586 --> 20:07.836
Henry is getting into
your head.

20:07.887 --> 20:09.704
Well, I need to know,
what is the six month gap,

20:09.756 --> 20:11.089
and what does it have to do
with Teo?

20:11.174 --> 20:13.392
- Annie.
- I'm trying to protect you,

20:13.476 --> 20:15.093
but you're not helping me do it.

20:15.178 --> 20:16.345
I've got it under control.

20:16.396 --> 20:18.263
You said, the minute
we start thinking that,

20:18.348 --> 20:19.932
he's beaten us.
Oh, come on.

20:20.016 --> 20:22.267
Henry is not the one lying
to me right now.

20:26.222 --> 20:28.273
We might keep secrets
for a living,

20:28.358 --> 20:30.075
but we can't keep them
from each other.

20:30.159 --> 20:31.410
I was just named
head of one of

20:31.494 --> 20:33.895
the most secretive departments
in the world.

20:33.947 --> 20:35.897
And you didn't even tell me
about it.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.567
I don't want to do this

20:39.619 --> 20:43.121
if we are gonna turn out
like Joan and Arthur.

20:43.206 --> 20:46.258
I want our lives outside
the building

20:46.342 --> 20:49.544
to be more important
than our lives inside it.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.964
You've got to make a choice,
Auggie.

20:52.048 --> 20:55.467
I am willing to go there.

20:55.551 --> 20:57.469
Are you?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.383
I'm home.

21:28.451 --> 21:30.385
I have all the documents
he asked for,

21:30.453 --> 21:32.954
but what if he's lying
about making a deal?

21:33.006 --> 21:35.257
What if we are the people
who know too many things?

21:37.583 --> 21:39.207
_

21:40.415 --> 21:41.955
_

21:42.135 --> 21:45.079
_

21:50.806 --> 21:51.857
Wendy, it's Annie

21:51.941 --> 21:53.408
from next door.
I saw you come home.

21:53.476 --> 21:55.477
I have an emergency.

21:55.528 --> 21:57.329
One second!

21:57.413 --> 22:00.248
I'm sorry, I can't.
I know you're scared.

22:00.316 --> 22:02.084
I'm here to help you.
Who are you?

22:02.151 --> 22:04.703
A friend.

22:04.787 --> 22:07.989
I followed you last night.

22:08.041 --> 22:09.561
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:11.010 --> 22:12.177
I know that you and Xu

22:12.261 --> 22:13.342
are moving money for Henry,

22:13.379 --> 22:14.463
and that he funded
the ALC bombing.

22:14.514 --> 22:16.098
I can offer you both safety

22:16.165 --> 22:17.632
if you give me proof.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.801
Is that what's in your bag?
Please, you don't understand.

22:19.852 --> 22:21.019
I do understand.

22:21.104 --> 22:22.804
He will kill you
if you don't have protection.

22:22.855 --> 22:25.390
He will kill my husband if
I don't get him what he wants.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.110
I know you love Xu.
I can help you both

22:28.177 --> 22:29.277
if you come with me.

22:29.345 --> 22:30.812
If I don't bring this,
Xu will die.

22:30.863 --> 22:32.280
Yeah, how about
you give that bag to me?

22:32.348 --> 22:34.349
Please, leave me alone!
She's trying to steal my bag.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.952
- Wendy, don't--
- Step back inside, please.

22:37.019 --> 22:38.987
We work together,
and she has something of mine.

22:39.038 --> 22:41.356
I'm gonna need
to see some I.D.

22:41.424 --> 22:44.242
I'm in 506, you can check
the rental agreement.

22:44.327 --> 22:47.212
Please don't touch anything.

23:10.627 --> 23:13.278
Hey, Barber.
How damaged is this SIM card?

23:13.480 --> 23:15.132
You're asking for my help?

23:15.133 --> 23:17.053
Well, Auggie is not here,
and I need it done now.

23:17.541 --> 23:21.461
Never thought I'd be
in the commander's chair.

23:21.528 --> 23:22.829
- You're sure this is okay, right?
- Positive.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.798
I just need to get into
her contact list.

23:26.934 --> 23:28.863
There.
Xu Chen.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.671
I need to track his cell's GPS.
Can you do that?

23:31.739 --> 23:33.239
Of course I can.

23:33.291 --> 23:34.374
It's kind of like
a first date, huh?

23:34.425 --> 23:36.093
- What?
- Well, you're gonna need

23:36.177 --> 23:38.095
a new handler if Auggie gets
the permanent gig.

23:38.179 --> 23:40.380
Am I the only one here
still trying to do my job

23:40.431 --> 23:41.882
instead of lobbying
for a better one?

23:41.933 --> 23:45.418
No hits.

23:45.470 --> 23:47.220
Must have gone dark.
I'll keep digging.

23:47.271 --> 23:48.805
Where's Anderson?

23:48.890 --> 23:51.875
- We don't know.
- I don't know.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.927
Then why did I find out about
a surveillance mission

23:53.978 --> 23:57.430
against two Chinese nationals
after the fact?

23:57.482 --> 23:58.782
You're gonna
have to ask Auggie.

23:58.866 --> 24:00.066
He's head of the DPD now.

24:00.118 --> 24:01.701
Interim head.

24:01.769 --> 24:03.120
The doorman
at the Capitol Towers

24:03.204 --> 24:04.905
filed a police report
against you.

24:04.956 --> 24:07.073
Claims that you're harassing
a Chinese attache

24:07.125 --> 24:08.942
named Wendy Chen.
Care to explain?

24:08.993 --> 24:10.243
I plan on filing my report

24:10.294 --> 24:13.446
as soon as the mission is over,
as usual.

24:13.498 --> 24:16.082
Well, in the absence of
your new boss and Mrs. Campbell,

24:16.134 --> 24:18.117
I am the senior officer
in this scenario.

24:18.169 --> 24:21.254
I'll also be reporting that
Mr. Anderson has no control over

24:21.305 --> 24:23.289
his department, no knowledge,
and no diplomacy

24:23.341 --> 24:25.892
regarding our relations
with China and its embassy.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.761
Mr. Anderson is right here,

24:27.812 --> 24:29.963
and I don't appreciate you
bringing the hammer down

24:30.014 --> 24:32.315
on me or my people
to compensate for the fact

24:32.400 --> 24:35.402
that Joan Campbell
beat you out for the DCS job.

24:35.469 --> 24:36.603
So, if you're done

24:36.654 --> 24:39.239
with your political maneuvering
for the evening,

24:39.306 --> 24:41.825
we need to get back to work.

24:41.909 --> 24:44.027
Enjoy flexing your muscle
while you can.

24:46.914 --> 24:49.583
- Where were you?
- At a department head meeting,

24:49.650 --> 24:51.251
but I should be asking you
that question.

24:51.252 --> 24:52.752
What the hell happened, Annie?

24:52.820 --> 24:55.255
Um, if you don't need me
anymore, I'm--

24:58.259 --> 24:59.979
I approached Wendy.
She got spooked and ran.

24:59.994 --> 25:02.846
- After I told you not to.
- It was my only chance.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.932
They're gonna bargain with Henry
as soon as he contacts them.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.167
- Henry doesn't bargain.
- I know.

25:08.219 --> 25:10.336
That's why we need their proof
to take Henry down.

25:10.388 --> 25:12.138
You can't do this stuff,
Annie.

25:12.190 --> 25:14.391
- What?
- You can't do things like

25:14.475 --> 25:18.061
engage Wendy Chen on your own
without telling me.

25:18.145 --> 25:20.030
You don't seem to have a
problem keeping things from me.

25:20.114 --> 25:21.865
- That's a separate issue.
- Maybe it's easier for you

25:21.949 --> 25:23.450
to turn things on and off
when we leave here,

25:23.517 --> 25:24.797
but I can't keep things
separate.

25:24.819 --> 25:25.986
Well, you're gonna
have to get used to it.

25:26.037 --> 25:29.072
I'm your boss now.

25:30.741 --> 25:32.692
Loud and clear, boss.

25:46.707 --> 25:50.594
202555-0108.

25:50.678 --> 25:52.545
Send text.

26:13.701 --> 26:16.736
Where is Annie?

26:16.787 --> 26:19.339
Not your concern.

26:19.406 --> 26:21.741
You texted me
on her burner phone.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.843
She said no one could trace it.

26:23.911 --> 26:26.129
How did you get the number?

26:26.213 --> 26:30.100
Who do you think gave that
to her in the first place?

26:30.184 --> 26:33.186
Of course.
What does she know?

26:33.253 --> 26:35.722
She knows enough
to keep asking more questions.

26:35.773 --> 26:37.557
Contact was not my idea.

26:37.608 --> 26:40.110
You need something, use me.

26:40.194 --> 26:41.945
I'm sorry, but you can't
exactly help me

26:42.029 --> 26:43.947
in the field anymore,
you know?

26:46.534 --> 26:48.151
What are you doing here?

26:48.235 --> 26:50.453
What do you mean?
You called this meeting.

26:50.538 --> 26:51.788
No, I mean in D.C.

26:51.872 --> 26:53.439
You wouldn't be here
without a reason.

26:53.491 --> 26:54.874
I don't answer to you, man.

26:54.942 --> 26:56.660
You don't answer to anyone.
That's the problem.

26:56.744 --> 26:58.828
That's exactly what
keeps me alive, you know?

27:02.300 --> 27:03.800
Did Annie tell you
about the Chens?

27:03.884 --> 27:05.302
We're looking into them.

27:05.386 --> 27:06.469
Let me know what you find.

27:06.554 --> 27:08.305
Why, so you can screw up
another mission?

27:08.389 --> 27:09.756
I don't think so.

27:09.807 --> 27:11.224
We want
the same thing, man.

27:11.291 --> 27:14.394
You just don't realize it.
You're blind to it...

27:14.461 --> 27:15.979
So to speak.

27:16.063 --> 27:17.514
You don't call the shots.

27:17.598 --> 27:19.298
- Is that understood?
- Whatever.

27:19.350 --> 27:20.800
So if you think
you're gonna come in here

27:20.851 --> 27:23.570
and be a part of this,
go home.

27:23.637 --> 27:27.657
Home.
What home?

27:27.742 --> 27:29.492
I am a fugitive
in Colombia now,

27:29.577 --> 27:31.995
thanks to that ALC raid
you staged.

27:32.079 --> 27:33.363
Arthur offered you asylum.

27:33.447 --> 27:35.865
My father offered me
a safe house in Panama,

27:35.950 --> 27:37.450
not a place at his table.

27:37.501 --> 27:38.651
You should talk to him.

27:38.703 --> 27:41.254
He's concerned about you,
as his son.

27:43.374 --> 27:47.093
He didn't raise a son.

27:47.161 --> 27:49.679
He raised a spy.

27:49.764 --> 27:52.766
What's it like,
to not have feelings?

27:53.884 --> 27:56.636
I hope you never know.

27:59.974 --> 28:02.058
And I'm sorry about
your eyes, man.

28:22.252 --> 28:24.536
- I found them.
- What?

28:24.564 --> 28:27.483
I got a facial recognition hit
on the Chens at Union Station.

28:34.641 --> 28:36.942
- I'm going.
- Well, what do I tell Auggie?

28:36.993 --> 28:38.944
Tell the boss
I'm doing my job.

28:47.454 --> 28:49.088
Excuse me.

28:49.156 --> 28:50.873
Uh, that couple
that just bought tickets,

28:50.957 --> 28:52.237
they--they dropped
these glasses.

28:52.259 --> 28:53.926
Can you tell me what train
they were headed to?

28:53.993 --> 28:56.512
I'm sorry, I can't, uh--

28:56.596 --> 29:00.683
Um, they--they look
really expensive.

29:00.767 --> 29:02.852
9:15 to Miami.
Track eight.

29:02.936 --> 29:05.671
Thank you.

29:05.722 --> 29:08.774
Barber, I'm gonna need
a pickup with heat.

29:08.841 --> 29:11.694
Armed vehicle coming right up.
Where?

29:11.778 --> 29:15.147
Northeast side.
I'll be on foot.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.669
Don't run.
Henry is already here.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.137
Did you tell your husband
what I offered?

29:38.204 --> 29:39.972
No one can protect us
from him.

29:40.039 --> 29:41.590
You have three minutes
to let me try.

29:41.675 --> 29:42.758
Henry doesn't bargain.

29:42.842 --> 29:44.376
What we have
is valuable to him.

29:44.427 --> 29:47.062
If what you have implicates
him in the Solstar bombing,

29:47.147 --> 29:50.182
you are safer with me,
but you have to decide now.

29:50.233 --> 29:52.568
Your lives will
never be the same,

29:52.652 --> 29:54.553
whichever way you choose,

29:54.604 --> 29:57.573
but at least if you let me help,
you can still be together.

30:01.077 --> 30:02.227
What do we do?

30:02.279 --> 30:04.280
Do you have it on you,
the proof against Henry?

30:04.364 --> 30:07.065
We mailed it ahead to Miami,
in case he was lying

30:07.117 --> 30:08.900
- about letting us go.
- He was.

30:08.952 --> 30:10.112
I can get you
to a safe house,

30:10.170 --> 30:11.570
and we'll have someone else
pick it up,

30:11.621 --> 30:14.406
but right now, we have to
get off the platform.

30:14.457 --> 30:16.408
Oh, this way.

30:23.049 --> 30:25.551
Go!

30:31.608 --> 30:33.142
The Chens are
under our protection.

30:33.226 --> 30:36.111
We've sent someone to intercept
their package in Miami.

30:36.196 --> 30:38.480
Wendy's spreadsheets
are her insurance policy.

30:38.565 --> 30:40.366
They can tie Henry directly
to the bombing,

30:40.433 --> 30:42.768
and I can go over them with her
in the morning.

30:42.819 --> 30:44.036
We've got him, Joan.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.654
Well, you know, I think
I'm going to worry

30:45.739 --> 30:47.957
about Henry Wilcox
until he is in the ground,

30:48.041 --> 30:50.876
but thank you.

30:50.943 --> 30:53.612
Annie, there's a reason why
I wanted to see you privately.

30:54.914 --> 30:57.132
Auggie authorized
the safe house

30:57.217 --> 31:00.386
and future Witness Protection
for the Chens.

31:00.453 --> 31:01.953
He knows you did
the right thing.

31:02.005 --> 31:05.924
It just may not be so easy
for him to tell you that now.

31:05.976 --> 31:08.761
Auggie being your boss
is going to present you

31:08.812 --> 31:12.648
with a whole new set
of challenges.

31:12.732 --> 31:14.066
I know we don't really have

31:14.133 --> 31:16.068
this kind of relationship,
but I'd--

31:18.188 --> 31:20.856
I just really wanted you
to know that I've been there.

31:21.992 --> 31:23.993
That means a lot.
Thank you.

31:26.979 --> 31:28.414
Was it worth it?

31:28.481 --> 31:30.315
Everything you and Arthur
went through to be together?

31:30.367 --> 31:32.701
I mean, would you do it again?

31:32.786 --> 31:37.006
Love is a powerful thing.

31:37.090 --> 31:38.791
Is there room for secrets?

31:38.842 --> 31:41.593
Only if there is room
for forgiveness, I suppose.

31:48.301 --> 31:50.853
I know what you did
for the Chens.

31:50.937 --> 31:54.440
I believe in you, Annie.
I hope you know that.

31:54.507 --> 31:56.725
I didn't want things
to change.

31:56.810 --> 31:57.860
I wanted us to stay the same,

31:57.944 --> 32:00.062
but I don't think
that can happen.

32:00.146 --> 32:02.114
No, you were right.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.116
Nothing matters more than us.

32:06.703 --> 32:09.521
I have some things
I have to tell you.

32:09.572 --> 32:11.707
No more secrets?

32:11.791 --> 32:13.709
No more secrets.

32:19.249 --> 32:21.333
I knew Teo much better
than I let on.

32:21.384 --> 32:25.587
In 2006, Arthur handpicked me
to train him,

32:25.672 --> 32:27.306
at a private site
in the Czech Republic

32:27.373 --> 32:29.224
we called River Run.

32:29.309 --> 32:30.976
That's the six month gap
in your record.

32:31.043 --> 32:33.228
Yeah, it won't be
in any of the CIA databases.

32:33.313 --> 32:34.563
It was completely off book.

32:34.647 --> 32:36.648
Because Teo's mission
wasn't for the CIA.

32:36.716 --> 32:39.435
It was personal, to kill
the man who killed his mother.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.558
That's not the only secret,
is it?

32:48.278 --> 32:50.863
Tell me, Auggie.
What did Teo do to you?

32:50.914 --> 32:53.732
It wasn't me he did it to.

32:57.921 --> 32:59.872
Who else was there?

33:03.042 --> 33:06.044
I wasn't his only trainer.
I had a partner.

33:06.096 --> 33:07.796
Her name was Helen Hansen.

33:07.881 --> 33:09.681
You were both
in place there together?

33:09.749 --> 33:11.683
As students.

33:14.187 --> 33:17.523
As married students.

33:17.590 --> 33:21.026
A cover marriage.

33:21.093 --> 33:23.428
In the beginning, yeah.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.764
We were just two operatives,
getting married for the mission,

33:25.815 --> 33:29.768
but... then the lines blurred.

33:31.604 --> 33:34.323
- You fell in love.
- It took us by surprise.

33:37.911 --> 33:40.946
Two agents
in the field together.

33:40.997 --> 33:42.280
No secrets.

33:42.332 --> 33:45.801
Just like you want us to be.

33:45.885 --> 33:48.720
You already had that...

33:48.788 --> 33:50.672
with someone else.

33:50.757 --> 33:54.343
- Yeah.
- Then what happened?

33:56.729 --> 33:59.681
Then Teo Braga happened.

33:59.766 --> 34:04.269
He supplied us with intel--
bad intel--

34:04.320 --> 34:08.907
that got Helen killed
right before my eyes.

34:08.975 --> 34:10.775
So, now you see why I cannot

34:10.827 --> 34:14.329
completely put my faith
in Teo Braga.

34:14.414 --> 34:15.813
- Or me?
- No.

34:15.864 --> 34:18.199
No, I am doing that
with you right now.

34:25.792 --> 34:28.594
God, I wish I knew what
your face looked like right now.

34:43.476 --> 34:46.177
You will never lose me
by telling me the truth.

34:48.982 --> 34:51.449
Then let's keep talking...

34:51.516 --> 34:53.784
Because I never want
to lose you.

34:56.406 --> 34:58.356
I think that's a good idea.

35:00.994 --> 35:01.910
Mm.

35:16.820 --> 35:20.270
Capital Grand.
The gentleman's doghouse.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.454
At least they make
a nice omelet.

35:23.505 --> 35:25.506
- How is Joan?
- Succeeding.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.459
<i>Brava, giovanna.</i>

35:28.510 --> 35:29.644
Fresh squeezed?

35:29.728 --> 35:31.512
Oh, I'm not breaking bread
with you, Henry.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.431
Now, you see?

35:33.482 --> 35:38.770
That's exactly what this
is all about.

35:38.821 --> 35:40.271
If you had shown me
any respect

35:40.322 --> 35:42.473
at any point
in our relationship,

35:42.524 --> 35:45.309
perhaps I would have
considered forgiveness.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.529
You belong in prison.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.698
My only child is dead,

35:50.783 --> 35:53.701
and I didn't get so much as
a sympathy card from you.

35:55.037 --> 35:56.997
I guarantee you, there is
no greater pain on earth

35:57.039 --> 35:58.989
than the loss of a child.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.961
I can't imagine.

36:04.012 --> 36:06.380
You can't?

36:06.465 --> 36:08.165
Imagine my surprise
when I discovered

36:08.217 --> 36:11.686
that you, too, had a son.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.438
I take it that Joanie was
even more surprised than I was.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.307
Oh, leave my family
out of this.

36:16.358 --> 36:18.810
At least you still have one
to worry about.

36:18.861 --> 36:21.178
Don't blame me
for your mistakes, Henry.

36:21.230 --> 36:23.481
I blame you for Jai's death,

36:23.532 --> 36:26.784
and you're going to pay,
a son for a son.

36:26.852 --> 36:29.203
You've already destroyed
my career and my marriage.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.289
Isn't that enough?

36:31.356 --> 36:34.075
That was just the overture.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.193
The opera is now about to begin.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.132
Oh, I almost forgot.

36:41.199 --> 36:45.369
I hear there's a new child
on the way.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.004
I hope it's a boy.

36:47.055 --> 36:49.307
You son of a bitch.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.476
Goodbye, Arthur.
Have a nice day.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.713
Gonna be a tough one
at Langley.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.597
Umbra 10-79.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.942
The safe house
is being cleaned.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.828
A mail carrier at the Miami-Dade
airport was attacked,

38:33.912 --> 38:36.664
the contents of his truck,
stolen.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.666
The Chens' package
wasn't recovered.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.167
Joan has been briefed
on everything.

38:40.252 --> 38:42.703
She is working from home.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.599
What did Henry do?

38:57.519 --> 38:59.854
I think you should
come back home now, Arthur.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.397
You were right.

39:09.481 --> 39:10.514
The minute we thought
we had it under control--

39:10.565 --> 39:11.983
We did have it
under control.

39:12.034 --> 39:14.785
I still can't understand how
that safe house was compromised.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.203
But it was.

39:16.288 --> 39:18.856
I'm drilling down
on Wendy Chen's contact list.

39:18.907 --> 39:20.024
At least we have that.

39:20.075 --> 39:22.043
They were in
each other's arms.

39:25.047 --> 39:26.530
- I know.
- I don't want you to be afraid

39:26.581 --> 39:28.299
of losing me.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.218
There is no way
we can stop Henry if you are.

39:31.303 --> 39:34.922
I am not out on a limb
for anyone but you.

39:37.426 --> 39:40.544
Auggie, Annie,
you remember Eric Braithwaite.

39:40.595 --> 39:43.064
- What can I do for you?
- I am very sorry to inform

39:43.148 --> 39:45.149
you that you have
been relieved of your duties

39:45.216 --> 39:50.237
as interim head of the DPD.
Why?

39:50.322 --> 39:51.689
Anderson,
you went against my advice,

39:51.740 --> 39:53.101
and you continued
with an operation

39:53.108 --> 39:55.893
that led to the violent deaths
of two Chinese citizens

39:55.944 --> 39:58.162
under your protection
on American soil.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.447
I think you've spent one day

39:59.531 --> 40:01.415
longer in this job than you
ever should have.

40:06.121 --> 40:09.040
Your replacement
is on his way up here.

40:09.091 --> 40:10.174
Someone who has proven himself

40:10.241 --> 40:11.959
to have the integrity
it's gonna take

40:12.044 --> 40:14.712
to make some overdue changes
around here.

40:16.798 --> 40:18.382
I'm sure you'll agree, Joan.

40:18.450 --> 40:21.385
You've made your point, Eric.
You can leave now.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.941
Henry did this.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.760
It doesn't matter.
Auggie's already taken the hit.

40:29.811 --> 40:32.613
From now on, we trust no one
but ourselves.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.815
No one.
Who's my replacement?

40:54.486 --> 40:57.054
Auggie...

40:57.122 --> 41:00.991
It's Calder.
