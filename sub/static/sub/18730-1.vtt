Do you have a twin sister?

23:00.605 --> 23:03.802
Alternately cycled to school.

23:04.925 --> 23:09.635
Clarissa was a better bike ride.
He knew how to ride a bicycle standing up.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.035
And to drive with no hands.
202 of
00:23:13,085 -> 00:23:15,645
One day, the
when it was my turn, -
203 of

I wanted to show,

23:21.805 --> 23:27.801
Pedal faster and faster.
Clarissa had to run hard.

23:29.925 --> 23:34.840
I let go of the handlebars.
I felt like to fly to.

23:36.125 --> 23:40.960
It felt wonderful.
I wanted to see myself, -

23:41.125 --> 23:48.236
so I looked at the window,
and thus the shadows.

23:51.205 --> 23:56.563
I do not know what happened.
Bike slid into the middle of the street.

23:59.325 --> 24:02.237
Truck ran towards me.

24:03.605 --> 24:09.202
All of a sudden I noticed that my sister
poking me. I flew over the handlebars.
211 of
00:24:11,685 -> 00:24:14,802

24:11.685 --> 24:14.802
Then I remember just ...

24:16.525 --> 24:19.403
Terrible ... thump.

24:26.045 --> 24:31.403

I asked him,
Clarisse what had happened.
215 of
00:24:37,685 -> 00:24:41,564
He did not even look at me.

24:37.685 --> 24:41.564
He did not even look at me.

24:42.085 --> 24:46.920
No one said anything,
but I knew their thoughts.

24:50.205 --> 24:52.719
That I killed him.

24:56.965 --> 25:01.197
After that, they do not ever
said he loved me.

25:09.725 --> 25:13.764
I love you.
- Do you love?

Then all is well again.

26:40.725 --> 26:45.753
For a week.

I do not want scandal.
I can not protect you anymore.

They jÃ¤nistÃ¤vÃ¤t. Now the spotlight has them
too unfinished and experimental.

choosing the right actors.

27:30.765 --> 27:34.201
Okay.

If anyone sees this,
I'm a goner.

27:44.205 --> 27:47.515
Pay the money back,

43:07.045 --> 43:12.597
What happened? I need to talk.
I noticed one strange thing.

43:16.565 --> 43:20.797
I am looking for one contract,
which was carried out earlier this year.

43:20.965 --> 43:24.958
I noticed a huge difference
Dirk Harriman on the figures provided -

43:25.685 --> 43:29.234
and the Middle East markets
the actual budget range.

43:29.405 --> 43:35.162
Christine added a folder in the Annex,
which is like a criminal prosecution.

43:48.765 --> 43:52.519
I knew that the man?
there was something strange. - What?

43:52.685 --> 43:57.440
Dirk betrayed the money, and Christine
stopped protecting him.

44:03.165 --> 44:07.477
Can I help you with something?
- Bring me some coffee.

44:09.925 --> 44:11.836

44:43.565 --> 44:46.602
I've put together for us
a small document.

44:46.765 --> 44:51.441
"Very stressed-out leader
not very secret life. "

44:51.925 --> 44:57.477
Also included is the ecstasy and suffering
and little instruction.

45:19.605 --> 45:24.395
One manager will be pissed.
Familiar to us all.

45:25.885 --> 45:29.958
Should not be given the frustration
to domination.

45:30.125 --> 45:34.164
Take a deep breath,
relax and keep going.

45:35.085 --> 45:37.474
Is not that right?

45:37.645 --> 45:40.159
This will be the next piece.

45:48.405 --> 45:50.965
Caught red-handed.

It was just a joke.

46:44.325 --> 46:46.714
Where's your sense of humor is?

46:48.765 --> 46:53.885
I think you really get hurt.

46:55.925 --> 46:59.042
I'm really sorry.

46:59.205 --> 47:02.481
I thought that we could
laugh at this one.

47:16.765 --> 47:19.518
It was funny.

47:52.445 --> 47:56.563
Hey. I would like to talk about

"I'll never forget that humiliated
to me. You'll pay for it. "

49:04.485 --> 49:07.318
"Revenge is sweet."

49:10.405 --> 49:13.920
I have not written that.
- It was sent to you from your computer.

49:14.085 --> 49:18.078
Not very clever.
- I did not write it.

49:18.245 --> 49:23.035
Hard to believe after the behavior.

56:16.085 --> 56:19.521
You are so charming all.

56:20.485 --> 56:24.922
And all so wonderfully boring.
All and sundry.

56:27.525 --> 56:30.961
Especially you.
It's true.

56:34.845 --> 56:36.642
Good night.

56:41.245 --> 56:43.236
Christine.

56:45.445 --> 56:51.634
Hello, Christine.
- Thank you for your help.

56:52.765 --> 56:57.964
I need to talk.
- Thank you. Good night.

56:58.965 --> 57:01.798
Hello to you.
- You are quite drunk.

57:01.965 --> 57:06.038
Yes, I am. Let's go inside.
- And not to go.
442,
00:57:07,365 -> 00:57:12,439
How did you get here?
- I drove the car really hard here.

57:07.365 --> 57:12.439
How did you get here?
- I drove the car really hard here.

57:12.605 --> 57:17.315
For God's sake. What's wrong with you?
What's going on?

57:17.485 --> 57:20.079
We need to talk.

57:20.245 --> 57:23.396
You made me ...
- There is talk now.

57:23.565 --> 57:28.639
You forced me to do
a very bad thing.

57:48.005 --> 57:52.396
You owe me.
Do not leave me in the lurch.

58:20.645 --> 58:22.954
DO NOT LOCK THE DOOR

58:23.125 --> 58:27.562
RIISUUDU, go take a shower,
SIDO your eyes and come to bed

01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:22.559
Let me in, Christine.

01:00:24.285 --> 01:00:27.322
Open the door, Christine.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:59.523
I'm coming.
Are you there?

01:02:57.205 --> 01:03:02.996
Days. I am a detective sergeant Bach.
He is my colleague.

01:03:03.165 --> 01:03:06.043
Are you Isabelle James?
- I am.

01:03:06.205 --> 01:03:09.038
Can we come in?
- Why?

01:03:11.685 --> 01:03:13.994
Are you all right?

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:18.843
Are you all right?
- I do not. I have not.

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:23.203
I took sleeping pills.
I can not sleep.

01:03:25.165 --> 01:03:30.478
Do you know that Christine Stanford
throat was slit on Saturday?

01:03:35.885 --> 01:03:38.160
Do you recognize this?

01:03:43.485 --> 01:03:49.117
Do you recognize this?
It has been sent from your computer.

01:03:56.245 --> 01:04:00.716
Is not the victim of some
humility now on you at work?

01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:04.399
Miss James?

01:04:08.765 --> 01:04:11.996
We found ... Miss James!

01:04:12.165 --> 01:04:14.281
I am here.

01:04:15.245 --> 01:04:19.841
We found the victim's hand, fibers,
derived from scarf.

01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:23.680
Such,
that you have in this picture.

01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:33.078
Can you explain it? Where were you
Saturday night at 23.30 - 01.00?

01:04:38.765 --> 01:04:42.041
I was at the ballet.
- Where?

01:04:43.285 --> 01:04:45.924
Ballet.

01:04:46.685 --> 01:04:49.643
Were you alone?
- I was.

01:04:49.805 --> 01:04:54.754
To identify any of you?
- Why would it have been?

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:59.282
Sometimes you can meet people,
who may remember.

01:05:00.645 --> 01:05:03.398
Remember what?
- You to attend.

01:05:03.565 --> 01:05:08.559
You would have an alibi, and you should
could not kill Christine Stanford.

01:05:09.645 --> 01:05:12.842
I could not ...
I will never ...

01:05:14.405 --> 01:05:18.557
If you have a lawyer,
you should call him.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.804
Open your mouth.

01:05:30.325 --> 01:05:34.716
Laboratory confirmed,
the fibers are scarf.

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:39.600
You will be charged with murder.

01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:50.274
Isabelle, are you okay?

01:05:51.925 --> 01:05:55.998
Can we get him in the water?
- Miss James.

01:05:57.765 --> 01:06:01.804
Is a break?
Do you need a doctor?

01:06:01.965 --> 01:06:05.241
I do not.
- Let's get this soon.

01:06:07.405 --> 01:06:13.753
Lavastitte burglary,
aggravating the offense.

01:06:14.645 --> 01:06:17.557
It is, therefore, of a deliberate murder.

01:06:19.325 --> 01:06:24.240
Why do not you just recognize?
It would save everyone time and money.

01:06:24.405 --> 01:06:29.081
You have a few fiber, which is suitable for
my client scarf image.

01:06:29.245 --> 01:06:34.444
How many other scarf they fit?
Did you find the sacrifice of my client's DNA?

01:06:39.445 --> 01:06:44.439
Surmasitteko Christine Stanford?
- Do not answer.

01:06:48.085 --> 01:06:52.397
Yes, yes, I suppose so.
- Think about what you say, Isabelle.

01:06:54.525 --> 01:06:58.234
What do you mean "probably"?
Surmasitteko?

01:06:58.405 --> 01:07:02.239
Did you kill her?
- Do not answer.

01:07:02.405 --> 01:07:06.284
Acknowledge that the murder?
- He did not do it.

01:07:07.205 --> 01:07:09.560
I confess.

01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:17.482
Hell!
- Forward.

01:07:25.005 --> 01:07:27.075
Login now!

01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:32.201
Away from the door!

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:30.238
<i> Are you all right, Isabelle </ i></i>

01:08:30.404 --> 01:08:33.795
<i> Surmasitteko Christine Stanford? </ i>
- Do not respond to . </ I></i>

01:08:33.965 --> 01:08:37.037
<i> Surmasitteko </ i>
-  He did not do it. </ I></i>

01:08:37.205 --> 01:08:41.243
<i> Did you kill her? </ i>
-  My client's mental state ... </ i></i>

01:08:41.404 --> 01:08:45.444
<i>Heads of  confessed to the murder. </ i>
-  I confess. </ I></i>

01:09:04.484 --> 01:09:07.602
What?
- I want to see my lawyer.

01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:12.316
I did not kill Christine.
- You want a confession back?

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:16.160
I'm innocent.
- Then why are you confessed?

01:09:16.325 --> 01:09:21.274
I do not know. I was so tired.
I was a pill drunk.

01:09:21.444 --> 01:09:24.993
I would have recognized anything.

01:09:25.885 --> 01:09:29.116
I need to talk
with the prosecutor immediately.

01:09:31.045 --> 01:09:35.835
This looks the same material,
but my scarf is not broken.

01:09:37.484 --> 01:09:41.603
Where is it?
- Somewhere in my apartment.

01:09:41.765 --> 01:09:45.279
We studied the apartment thoroughly
and did not find anything.

01:09:45.444 --> 01:09:52.317
Seek out yet. The scarf is there.
- He has no reason to lie.

01:09:52.484 --> 01:09:58.321
You've wasted enough of my time.
- Why would I be murdered Christine?

01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:03.320
You had a strong motive. Revenge.
- I have not written that.

01:10:03.485 --> 01:10:08.036
And if I were, then it would have been
foolish to kill him.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:12.118
Christine probably sent it to the
my computer.

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:19.358
Creator. Look at the date.

01:10:19.525 --> 01:10:23.120
This is referred to
days before the lumps.

01:10:25.285 --> 01:10:29.517
Do you see? The day before
he humbled me.

01:10:32.045 --> 01:10:34.957
This does not make sense.
I did not write this.

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:39.482
I was about to get a promotion,
Christine and bear it.

01:10:39.645 --> 01:10:45.242
He tried to suppress Isabelle.
Many department confirms -

01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:49.080
that my client became depressed
Christine's bullying of.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.964
Are you crazy?
That's defenses?

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:55.481
Spare
mitigating circumstances for the judge!

01:10:55.645 --> 01:10:59.524
I'm only interested in evidence.
- It is what we are trying to give.

01:10:59.685 --> 01:11:03.564
I was not Christine's house.
I was at the ballet.

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:06.193
You claim it.

01:11:09.485 --> 01:11:12.204
I talked to
Ballet with an usher.

01:11:12.365 --> 01:11:16.517
He had a gray, curly hair,
and he spoke bad English.

01:11:16.685 --> 01:11:19.153
He remembers me.

01:11:21.685 --> 01:11:25.917
Have you seen this woman?
- I do not.

01:11:26.085 --> 01:11:28.315
Do not you surely?
- I do not.

01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:41.079
Days. Katsoisitteko this?
Have you seen this woman?

01:11:43.765 --> 01:11:47.280
I am.
- Do you?

01:11:47.445 --> 01:11:51.961
He sat there. He wanted to
may sit in the middle of the line.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:55.003
I had to guide him in there.

01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:59.317
Whether or not this will certainly
this woman? - There was.

01:12:00.085 --> 01:12:04.601
I booked a ticket
Saturday night's myÃ¶hÃ¤isnÃ¤ytÃ¶kseen.

01:12:04.765 --> 01:12:07.882
He could not be
Christine's home.

01:12:08.045 --> 01:12:13.278
Maybe he left the States. Christine
the house was ten minutes away.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:22.119
Why do not you ask Dirk harrimanella?
He was reportedly there.

01:12:22.285 --> 01:12:26.039
He was furious,
Christine rejected because of him.

01:12:26.205 --> 01:12:28.241
And he was drunk.

01:12:29.205 --> 01:12:35.155
He knew everything from ballet.
- It is a well-known classic.

01:12:35.325 --> 01:12:39.716
Usher guarantee him an alibi.
What else do we have?

01:12:39.885 --> 01:12:43.878
His DNA was not
the murder weapon and the crime scene.

01:12:44.045 --> 01:12:47.560
No DNA but e-mail,
which is the only who could not write.

01:12:47.725 --> 01:12:52.082
As if we were forced
labile to recognize the woman.

01:12:52.245 --> 01:12:54.884
Just check
Christine male friend.

01:12:55.045 --> 01:12:58.196
Witnesses saw them
fighting over the crime scene outside.

01:12:58.365 --> 01:13:02.244
Or even miesystÃ¤vÃ¤kin.
Either the house is checking out?

01:13:02.405 --> 01:13:05.556
Together, this evidence
nolaan myself in court.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:11.395
My client was accused of
wrong reasons. He has an alibi.

01:13:11.565 --> 01:13:15.274
Against him is not
no evidence. No DNA.

01:13:15.445 --> 01:13:19.120
What about the scarf fibers?
- They are not my huivistani.

01:13:19.285 --> 01:13:24.882
You say, then, that you have for one.
- It must be found. It is not broken.

01:13:25.045 --> 01:13:29.277
May I make a suggestion?
- Of course.

01:13:29.445 --> 01:13:34.041
Do you offer to help my client
scarf for search?

01:14:21.885 --> 01:14:23.762
What's this?

01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:30.080
Christine found out that Dirk
tried to cheat a large sum of money.

01:14:30.245 --> 01:14:33.794
How much?
- I do not know the exact figure.

01:14:33.965 --> 01:14:36.399
More than five million.

01:14:36.565 --> 01:14:40.399
The sum of one million of Class,
and Christine was going to expose him?

01:14:40.565 --> 01:14:43.477
Why piilottelitte proof?

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:48.275
We are friends. Dirk needed
just the time to restore the money.

01:14:48.445 --> 01:14:52.563
So hid the information. Do not you
understand that it is a motive for murder?

01:14:52.725 --> 01:14:56.195
No! Dirk could never do that.

01:14:57.885 --> 01:15:01.639
We have to leave.
- Wait a minute. Can I look for?

01:15:01.805 --> 01:15:06.879
My scarf is in that box.
Sometimes they slip out of the back of the box.

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:11.118
Alright. Let her look.
- Thank you.

01:15:21.205 --> 01:15:25.244
It's got to be here.
- That's enough, Isabelle.

01:15:25.405 --> 01:15:28.841
It's got to be here! No!

01:15:29.005 --> 01:15:33.556
Even a minute!
Just one minute! Do not be!

01:15:37.045 --> 01:15:39.081
I did not do it.

01:15:39.245 --> 01:15:43.397
Of course not.
I know that.

01:15:49.485 --> 01:15:53.842
Headscarf is
in one of the apartment.

01:15:54.885 --> 01:15:57.274
You have to look for it.

01:16:20.165 --> 01:16:23.919
What a mess.
Should I clean up?

01:16:25.325 --> 01:16:29.398
Where did you get this?
- It was dirty, the back of the box.

01:16:29.565 --> 01:16:32.443
I took it to the cleaners.

01:16:32.605 --> 01:16:37.121
Ms. Wirth, this is outrageous.
You will get another cleaner.

01:16:40.885 --> 01:16:42.637
Detective Chief Inspector Bach.

01:16:45.405 --> 01:16:48.715
Mr. Harriman.
- What do you want?

01:16:48.885 --> 01:16:53.561
I am a detective sergeant Bach.
You are accused of embezzlement.

01:16:53.725 --> 01:16:59.721
We studied the place.
First the car, then your apartment.

01:16:59.885 --> 01:17:04.083
You have to get the wire.
- The prosecutor will explain to you everything.

01:17:05.525 --> 01:17:08.915
Christine broke into Stanford
apartment night of the murder?

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:12.634
I will not.
- Do you deny olleenne there?

01:17:12.805 --> 01:17:14.875
I do not.

01:17:15.045 --> 01:17:20.915
Were you his guest?
- I was. I arrived late.

01:17:21.085 --> 01:17:24.521
When?
- I do not remember.

01:17:24.685 --> 01:17:28.678
You do not remember?
- I do not remember.

01:17:36.165 --> 01:17:38.554
Is this you?

01:17:40.165 --> 01:17:43.282
It was scarf.

01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:47.081
Was that?
- Yes.

01:17:47.245 --> 01:17:51.955
If that's Christine Stanford
blood ... Put the recovery.

01:17:54.525 --> 01:17:58.757
This is ridiculous.
- Kavalsitte company money.

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:03.919
Christine was going to report you.
You're a villain but also a murderer.

01:18:04.085 --> 01:18:09.079
I do not speak any
without a lawyer present.

01:18:15.245 --> 01:18:20.194
Is not it incredible?
He bought me a bouquet of roses.

01:18:20.365 --> 01:18:24.324
Then he showed up at my door
apologize.

01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:28.603
He was quite red
naamaltaan and bathed in sweat.

01:18:28.765 --> 01:18:31.723
He was so sorry,
I was arrested a while.

01:18:31.885 --> 01:18:35.321
The time sweet.
Did you invite him in?

01:18:35.485 --> 01:18:40.161
No, you crazy?
I smiled sweetly, -

01:18:40.325 --> 01:18:44.637
I took the cheap roses fool
with explanatory notes and threw them in the garbage.

01:18:44.805 --> 01:18:47.444
Bach poor. What a clichÃ©.

01:18:47.605 --> 01:18:50.995
The hard-boiled cop
fall in love with the beautiful killer.

01:18:52.765 --> 01:18:55.484
I'm not a murderer.

01:18:57.005 --> 01:18:58.643
Oh, yeah.

01:18:59.725 --> 01:19:04.276
Dani ...
I know what you did for me.

01:19:05.765 --> 01:19:10.281
You would have done the same for me.
- Of course.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:23.562
Shall again
number 26? - Okay.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:47.643
They are okay, but do not
good enough. What do you think?

01:19:52.605 --> 01:19:54.436
Dani!

01:19:56.285 --> 01:19:59.322
That kiss did not happen.

01:19:59.485 --> 01:20:04.036
I love you.
I want you, Isabelle.

01:20:07.405 --> 01:20:09.680
That's the problem.

01:20:11.485 --> 01:20:15.478
Why?
- Jesus Christ! Are you kidding me?

01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:25.277
After all, you love me.
- I do not. What's wrong with you?

01:20:25.445 --> 01:20:28.198
I do not love you.
- You love.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:31.641
You may not want to admit it,
but you love me.

01:20:31.805 --> 01:20:36.083
We have drunk too much.
I make espressos, and I'll call a taxi.

01:20:36.245 --> 01:20:39.635
Go home and sleep.
Talk to you tomorrow.

01:20:39.805 --> 01:20:45.004
No, not tomorrow.
It's not true, Isabelle?

01:20:45.165 --> 01:20:49.795
You love me.
- Stop it. You are pathetic.

01:20:49.965 --> 01:20:53.560
Am I pathetic?
All my support after that?

01:20:53.725 --> 01:20:59.755
I am grateful. Thank you.
- That you gave already.

01:21:01.885 --> 01:21:07.278
This is the espresso. Sit down
and then find out. I'll call you a cab.

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:19.597
Hello. The most space taxi.

01:22:09.005 --> 01:22:11.519

You know, I'm not at risk.
I was wondering pills popsimistasi.

01:22:21.165 --> 01:22:25.761
<i> Until a couple of them fell to </ i>
 teeheni and I tasted them. </ i></i>

01:22:25.925 --> 01:22:29.884

Sweetening harmless.

01:22:31.845 --> 01:22:35.838
I followed you to see

01:22:40.085 --> 01:22:43.794

The perfect moment.

Let me in, Christine.

01:24:45.245 --> 01:24:49.477
<i>Confession was the bait.
-  I confess. </ I></i>

01:24:49.645 --> 01:24:54.355
It's a fool lieutenant swallowed up the false
hook, line and sinker clues.

01:25:05.525 --> 01:25:08.961
The perfect murder.
- Except for ...

01:25:09.805 --> 01:25:11.477
Videos.

01:25:11.645 --> 01:25:16.400
I gathered them aggravating
folder Lieutenant Bach.

01:25:16.565 --> 01:25:18.874
And I downloaded this folder.

01:25:19.045 --> 01:25:22.799
And can not be traced?
- I bought this for that purpose.

01:25:22.965 --> 01:25:28.756
Is not it cute?
You just have to press the send button.

01:25:38.165 --> 01:25:42.238
What do you want?
- Do not talk like that tone.

01:25:45.565 --> 01:25:47.840
What do you want?

01:25:49.605 --> 01:25:51.402
Come here.

01:26:04.445 --> 01:26:06.356
Sit down.

01:26:10.445 --> 01:26:12.754
Come closer.

01:26:19.725 --> 01:26:21.522
Kiss me.

01:26:31.485 --> 01:26:35.922
Do not like it?
You love me.

01:26:48.685 --> 01:26:50.880
Turn around.

01:27:01.005 --> 01:27:03.155
I love you.

01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:02.800
I thought,
the twin sister of a fairy tale.

01:28:03.765 --> 01:28:07.280
I did not get the opportunity to
ask for forgiveness.

01:28:34.325 --> 01:28:36.043
