went on the attack,

Bradley, came in and he
fucked up so badly,

Us together
is not too far‐reaching.

through that bullshit,
Rosie won't stay.

So you sure you don't wanna
come with us to Gail's birthday
party there, big sugar?

‐Two‐knuckler.

‐Like a horizontal knuckler?
‐Hard no.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.633
‐That means
that a two‐knuckler...
‐Can confirm.

14:40.666 --> 14:44.100
A person has two knuckles, okay?
One, two. It's not knuckle.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.200
I asked.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.866
I asked the vet
if that sort of person
has two knuckles per finger.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.233
One, two.
Okay? It's clinical.

14:50.266 --> 14:52.000
So, I don't wanna hear
another word about it. Fuck.

‐Firing knuckles up

14:58.066 --> 15:00.100
‐What do you mean?
‐Well...

15:00.133 --> 15:01.933
that could be a lot of work.

15:01.966 --> 15:04.066

never work a day in your life.

‐Wayne, how are you now?
‐Good, and you?

15:06.666 --> 15:08.200
‐Then, tell...
‐Tell that to your face.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.133
Yes, Katy, it's really funny
how you keep saying that.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.733
What's the deal with Stormy?

15:11.766 --> 15:13.633
Physically,
she's in ship shape.

15:13.666 --> 15:15.800
She's chiseled out of stone.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.700
The vet says that she's
the healthiest German Shepherd
she's ever seen.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.633
‐Vet like Shepherds.
‐Oh, the vet love Shepherds.

15:20.666 --> 15:22.033
Shepherds are fucking lovable.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.633
So then, what's the problem?

15:25.266 --> 15:28.366
Vet said she might be depressed.

‐Dogs get depressed?
‐Get real!

15:35.433 --> 15:38.033
The only difference
is that Stormy can't talk.

15:38.066 --> 15:40.400
I bet if she could talk,
then she would
tell us what's wrong

15:40.433 --> 15:42.666
so we could do something
to fix it.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.100
You can talk.

15:44.133 --> 15:46.633
And it would be wise
for you to use that luxury

15:46.666 --> 15:50.000
