03:24.450 --> 03:26.773
Obviously, this is
all highly confidential

had a little exchange back there

Well, I have a glass of
wine as a celebration,

to give up red wine.

30:01.115 --> 30:02.568
- This one.
- Okay.

30:02.571 --> 30:04.115
Hang on.

30:04.118 --> 30:06.513
Wait, what does that
say? Give me my glasses.

30:06.516 --> 30:08.865
STEPHEN: "I am the black woman

30:08.868 --> 30:10.700
having Colin Morrello's baby,

30:10.703 --> 30:13.617
- and my name is Lucca Quinn."
- Oh, my God.

30:13.620 --> 30:16.161
- "Did Sally Hemings have a law degree?"
- [LAUGHS]

30:16.164 --> 30:18.122
"#MoreLikeMichelle."

30:18.125 --> 30:20.385
Oh, God, I love her.

30:20.388 --> 30:22.606
She took the bait. We
are off and running.

30:22.609 --> 30:23.701
[LAUGHS]

30:23.704 --> 30:25.199
DIANE: Well, this is
not a gentle maneuver.

30:25.201 --> 30:26.659
Yes, but you're turning it into a coup.

30:26.661 --> 30:27.802
No, this is not a coup.

30:27.805 --> 30:29.544
These are all tools

30:29.547 --> 30:32.560
supplied to prevent our country
from turning into a monarchy.

30:32.563 --> 30:34.380
This is Trump Derangement Syndrome.

30:34.383 --> 30:36.183
Actually, it's just the opposite.

30:36.186 --> 30:37.708
It's clarity.

30:37.710 --> 30:41.166
I've spent the last few months
feeling fucking deranged!

30:41.169 --> 30:44.062
Like I'm living in
some bad reality show.

30:44.064 --> 30:45.411
Going numb!

30:45.413 --> 30:46.997
All Trump, all the time.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.630
What's real? What's fake?

30:48.633 --> 30:50.415
Well, you know what? I just woke up.

30:50.418 --> 30:52.288
JULIUS: It's the same way with Obama...

30:52.291 --> 30:54.117
Can I speak to you for a minute?

30:54.120 --> 30:55.979
JULIUS: when they tried
to drive Obama out.

30:55.982 --> 30:57.947
You cannot compare
Obama to Trump, Julius.

30:57.950 --> 30:59.689
No, no, no, no, I voted for Obama.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.419
Oh, I can compare them just as well,

31:01.422 --> 31:03.821
- 'cause it's the same thing.
- No, it's not the same!

31:03.823 --> 31:05.825
- It's the same argument!
- [ARGUING CONTINUES]

31:07.827 --> 31:09.404
What is it you need?

31:09.407 --> 31:11.015
You want us to do our best?

31:11.018 --> 31:12.540
I think you are.

31:12.543 --> 31:14.020
Then I think you should ask Julius

31:14.023 --> 31:15.545
to step out of the debate.

31:15.548 --> 31:17.809
Why?

31:17.812 --> 31:19.681
He doesn't agree with us.

31:19.684 --> 31:21.791
[CHUCKLES]

31:21.794 --> 31:24.424
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.245
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

31:32.248 --> 31:34.555

31:38.809 --> 31:40.594
Diane?

31:44.044 --> 31:46.044
Yes?

31:46.047 --> 31:48.743
You all right?

31:48.745 --> 31:52.443
[CHUCKLES]

31:52.445 --> 31:54.662
Why?

31:54.664 --> 31:57.709
Because I suggested taking
my gun to the streets?

31:57.711 --> 31:59.667
We can start there.

31:59.669 --> 32:03.238
I have never been more all right.

32:04.718 --> 32:08.241
How much of this is show for the DNC?

32:08.243 --> 32:10.277
What do you want to hear?

32:10.280 --> 32:11.956
That it's show.

32:15.886 --> 32:17.667
It's a show.

32:20.212 --> 32:22.649
But you have a gun in your desk?

32:25.425 --> 32:27.869
I think you two should see this.

32:27.871 --> 32:29.425
MARISSA: I got this online.

32:29.428 --> 32:31.925
It's a deck of cards
about Chicago lawyers.

32:31.928 --> 32:33.886
Targeting Chicago lawyers.

32:33.889 --> 32:35.453
David Lee,

32:35.456 --> 32:37.698
Laura Hellinger, Patti Nyholm...

32:37.701 --> 32:38.784
Wait, wait, wait.

32:38.787 --> 32:40.613
These cards are targeting lawyers?

32:40.616 --> 32:42.050
Chicago lawyers.

32:42.053 --> 32:44.053
It's called the "Kill
All the Lawyers" deck.

32:44.056 --> 32:45.972
Oh, my God.

32:45.975 --> 32:47.627
Where'd you find these?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.342
A website with gifts for the alt-right.

32:49.345 --> 32:52.152
What were you doing on a website
with gifts for the alt-right?

32:52.155 --> 32:53.292
I go everywhere.

32:53.295 --> 32:55.438
Couldn't this be
provocation to violence?

32:55.441 --> 32:57.628
- Get a cease and desist.
- Mm-mm. No, no, no.

32:57.631 --> 32:59.408
That would just give
them too much attention.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.847
Are any of us on it?

33:01.850 --> 33:03.744
Who?

Oh, my God.

To answer your question, Adrian,

33:46.762 --> 33:49.154
What's that about?

33:49.157 --> 33:52.332
She's asking Julius not to join us.

33:52.335 --> 33:54.363
Why?

33:54.366 --> 33:56.455
Because he's pro-Trump.

34:03.003 --> 34:05.293
Look, I don't want to leave
it in an uncomfortable place,

34:05.296 --> 34:07.688
so, uh, I think I should go.

34:07.691 --> 34:09.972
- Where again?
- MAIA: Uh, Weimar.

34:09.975 --> 34:12.542
It's a, oh, it's a
dance club in the Loop.

34:12.545 --> 34:13.936
- At 10:00.
- I don't know.

34:13.938 --> 34:15.719
I have a trial that starts tomorrow.

34:15.723 --> 34:17.679
Well, I think I should
go. You know, just,

34:17.683 --> 34:19.268
just so it's not impolite.

34:19.272 --> 34:21.159
Well, do you want to go without me?

34:21.161 --> 34:22.378
No. No.

- I-I just think I should go.
- AMY: Okay.

34:24.733 --> 34:26.081

- AMY: Sure.

Uh, good luck with the trial.

Uh, well, uh, good
luck with it tomorrow.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.964
- you didn't call him, did you?
- Who?

34:46.967 --> 34:49.498
Marshall Lock? No. What did he say?

34:49.502 --> 34:51.676
He wants me to be his lawyer again.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.152
Talk about mood swings.

34:53.155 --> 34:54.885
- Well, maybe Diane called him.
- No.

34:54.888 --> 34:57.777
He said he wants to be
near the center of power.

- And that I'm now...
- Your tweet.

- Hey.

35:11.872 --> 35:13.649

I'm not gonna lie,
I'm not gonna mislead,

35:16.083 --> 35:18.878
and I'm not gonna be the
woman who stands by your side.

35:18.881 --> 35:21.573
I'm the mother of your child,
a close friend of yours,

35:21.576 --> 35:22.566

District of Illinois.

gonna agree to my terms.

Okay. Do you want to come in?

35:31.549 --> 35:33.201

I'll issue a public
statement of support.

35:35.795 --> 35:37.831
And I'll make myself
available for interviews.

That's the deal.

35:39.420 --> 35:41.246
And you'll stay off Twitter?

- [SIGHS]
- COLIN: Yeah, I wanted to tell you

35:42.881 --> 35:44.191
my mom was here, but you...

35:44.194 --> 35:46.988
Lucca does not mind, we're good friends.

35:46.991 --> 35:49.277
Come on in. I've got bagels.

35:52.702 --> 35:54.051
Wow, that's pregnant.

35:55.122 --> 35:56.667
Good pregnant, not a bad thing.

35:56.677 --> 35:59.300
This is Stephen Rankin-Hall.
He's helping us out.

35:59.303 --> 36:00.825
Stephen, this is Lucca Quinn.

36:00.828 --> 36:02.828
That's my son's... lover.

36:02.831 --> 36:04.542
Do we like that word?

36:04.545 --> 36:06.110
No. It sounds perverse.

36:06.113 --> 36:08.156
"The mother of my baby."

36:08.159 --> 36:10.378
Yeah. That's me.

36:10.388 --> 36:12.511
I'm not on the spectrum,
but I have been told

36:12.514 --> 36:14.253
I don't recognize sarcasm very well.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.603
That was sarcasm, right?

36:15.606 --> 36:17.550
- A bit.
- We are being thankful

36:17.553 --> 36:19.081
toward Lucca for any involvement,

36:19.084 --> 36:21.124
even the most minimal.

36:21.127 --> 36:23.518
Lucca, have a bagel.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.129
It's good for the baby.

36:25.131 --> 36:27.228
We're going over our political strategy.

36:27.231 --> 36:29.492
- How much does she know?
- You can talk to me.

36:29.495 --> 36:32.664
- How much do you know?
- Not that much.

36:32.667 --> 36:36.270
There are four party bosses
who control the replacement

36:36.272 --> 36:37.930
for Barnsdale in the 1st.

36:37.933 --> 36:40.695
So this is a campaign to
convince only four people.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.843
Should be easy, right? Four
people instead of 65,000.

36:43.845 --> 36:46.183
But it is a lot easier to lose one vote

36:46.186 --> 36:48.344
than it is to lose 10,000 votes.

36:48.347 --> 36:50.545
- And when is this decided?
- COLIN: In two weeks.

36:50.547 --> 36:52.330
I'm meeting with the bosses next week.

36:52.333 --> 36:53.750
How many candidates are there?

36:53.753 --> 36:56.357
That changes. We think
five. We scared off two.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.664
And what are Colin's chances?

36:57.667 --> 36:59.903
- Mm.
- Good. He's the only prosecutor.

36:59.905 --> 37:01.773
STEPHEN: Which can be bad, too.

37:01.776 --> 37:04.175
It's partly a blue collar
congressional district,

37:04.178 --> 37:07.257
partly African-American,
that's where you can be helpful.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.737
I'm a defense attorney.

37:08.739 --> 37:11.610
Yes. And biracial, if I can say that.

37:11.612 --> 37:12.605
You can say that.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.177
And you're not a burning-eyed radical.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.440
Loved the Sally Hemings tweet.

37:15.443 --> 37:17.235
- Was that you or someone else?
- That was me.

37:17.238 --> 37:18.703
Do you know the sex of the kid?

37:18.706 --> 37:19.792
Nope.

37:19.794 --> 37:21.011
You'll keep me informed.

37:21.013 --> 37:22.795
You'll be the first I'll call.

37:22.797 --> 37:24.623
- Sarcasm.
- Very good.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.917
Thank you. But you two
are not getting married?

37:26.920 --> 37:29.480
- COLIN: No.
- No, they're a modern couple.

37:29.483 --> 37:30.700
Living in sin.

37:30.703 --> 37:32.064
Don't tweet that, okay?

37:32.067 --> 37:35.199
I have to go.

37:35.201 --> 37:36.809
- You all right?
- Sure.

37:36.811 --> 37:39.768
Why wouldn't I be okay about
what I can tweet and not tweet?

37:39.770 --> 37:42.032
- Call me.
- And me, dear.

37:42.034 --> 37:44.036
Going now.

37:47.629 --> 37:50.500
"On Tuesday, May 9, 2017,

37:50.503 --> 37:53.331
Donald John Trump impeded..."

37:53.334 --> 37:55.073
Let's say "on or about" the 9th.

37:55.076 --> 37:56.555
There's no dispute about
the date. It was the 9th.

37:56.557 --> 37:58.903
"On or about" is the standard
language in articles of impeachment.

37:58.905 --> 38:00.253
You know, let's lose the Tuesday.

38:00.256 --> 38:01.855
I mean, what difference does
the day of the week make?

38:01.857 --> 38:03.020
ADRIAN: What difference
does it make to leave it in?

38:03.022 --> 38:06.272
Uh, let's talk for a
minute. That was the DNC.

38:06.275 --> 38:09.929
They're watching this in
real time, and they have...

38:09.931 --> 38:12.760
Actually, let's-let's
step out for a second.

38:15.806 --> 38:17.937
It's between you and one other firm.

38:17.939 --> 38:19.721
Really?

38:19.723 --> 38:22.618
RUTH: Yes. That's a real achievement.

38:22.621 --> 38:26.923
But I-I need to offer just a
hint of constructive criticism.

38:26.926 --> 38:30.040
This other firm is a bit
staid and white-shoed.

38:30.043 --> 38:32.048
They're more mainstream Democrat.

38:32.051 --> 38:35.571
What the DNC likes about you
is how passionate you are,

38:35.574 --> 38:39.391
how you have a very specific
point of view, a more...

38:39.394 --> 38:43.040
Oh, what's the word? A
more pugnacious attitude.

38:43.043 --> 38:44.407
They want to see that.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.366
They can get these legal
arguments from anyone.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.027
But they want to see your passion.

38:50.030 --> 38:54.597
They want to see your anger
about what Trump is doing.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.426
Okay?

38:56.429 --> 38:57.689
Sure. Sure.

38:57.692 --> 38:59.694
- Okay. I'll see you in there.
- Yep.

39:04.229 --> 39:07.143
They want us to be street.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.753
Oh, my God.

39:08.755 --> 39:11.809
So... what do we do?

39:11.812 --> 39:13.602
Well, we're being offered
a seat at the table.

39:13.604 --> 39:15.519
We can't cry about it now, you know?

39:15.522 --> 39:18.479
I-I will be the angry black woman,

39:18.482 --> 39:20.798
and, uh, you can be Black Lives Matter.

39:20.801 --> 39:22.098
You know, and...

39:22.101 --> 39:23.262
What about me?
