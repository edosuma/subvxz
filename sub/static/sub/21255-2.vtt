WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:03.933
- VERNON: Previously on
"Still the King"--

00:04.033 --> 00:05.567
- We're kicking you out, Walt?
- Why?

00:05.667 --> 00:07.267
- You shot a lumberjack
in the neck.

00:07.367 --> 00:08.667
- I thought you were
a Sasquatch.

00:08.767 --> 00:10.367
You probably think I'm crazy.

00:10.467 --> 00:11.500
- You're not crazy, man.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.533
- Vernon. Charlotte's dad.

00:13.633 --> 00:15.233
- I'm king dad
around these parts.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.467
You can bet your boat
I'm gonna keep it that way.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.000
Oh!
- [explosion]

00:19.100 --> 00:20.200
- Whoa!

00:20.300 --> 00:21.267
- Goodbye, Ronnie.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.767
We'll miss you.

00:25.367 --> 00:26.400
I'm pregnant, Vernon.

00:26.500 --> 00:27.800
And it might be yours.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.000
- *

00:33.867 --> 00:37.933
- *

00:38.033 --> 00:39.133
- [bell dings]

00:39.233 --> 00:40.333
- Morning.

00:40.433 --> 00:42.200
- Morning, girls. Have a seat.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.700
Hope you and my baby are ready

00:43.800 --> 00:46.167
for some world-famous
Vernon Brown flapjacks.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.867
- Oh, you really, really
shouldn't have.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.700
- Oh no, it was my pleasure.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.867
Key to good flapjacks:
a pinch of love

00:52.967 --> 00:55.200
and excessive butter. [laughs]

00:55.300 --> 00:57.800
- Wow, you've exceeded
my low expectations.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.433
- Oh, you're not the first
person to say that to me.

01:00.533 --> 01:03.067
Oh, no, no, don't you
even think about it. I got it.

01:03.167 --> 01:06.133
- I can pour orange juice.
I'm pregnant, not crippled.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.333
- I'm man of the house now, and
that comes with certain duties.

01:09.433 --> 01:11.767
You just set back and relax.

01:11.867 --> 01:14.300
Charlotte, by the way,
it's trash day.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.433
And it looks like the yard
could use a mow.

01:16.533 --> 01:17.933
- Right. Yeah, I'll get
right on that

01:18.067 --> 01:20.200
right after I finish polishing
your Father of the Year trophy.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.633
- You do that.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.067
- Vernon, I'm happy that
you're excited that this baby

01:24.100 --> 01:26.067
is potentially yours.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.367
But remember,
the jury's still out.

01:28.467 --> 01:30.067
- Well, I don't see
any other potential daddies

01:30.133 --> 01:31.267
walking through the walk.

01:31.367 --> 01:32.900
- [door opens]

01:33.067 --> 01:35.433
- [dog barking]

01:35.533 --> 01:39.900
- *

01:59.067 --> 02:00.600
- Uh!

02:00.700 --> 02:03.500
You would not believe
the couple months I've had.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.833
- *

02:05.933 --> 02:08.067
* Still the King *

02:12.633 --> 02:13.467
- [sighs]

02:13.567 --> 02:17.533
So there I was lost, stranded.

02:17.633 --> 02:18.967
Hello?

02:19.067 --> 02:20.167
Suffering from amnesia.

02:20.267 --> 02:22.767
Who am I?

02:22.867 --> 02:26.200
But luckily my superior survival
instincts kicked in immediately.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.767
Help! Help!

02:28.867 --> 02:30.600
Help!

02:30.700 --> 02:32.367
So I set out to build shelter.

02:32.467 --> 02:36.633
Build something
to rest my weary bones.

02:36.733 --> 02:40.100
I was starving,
desperate for food.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.467
- Really?

02:41.567 --> 02:44.133
To be honest, it looks like
you gained a few pounds.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.233
- Well, little known fact
about Ronnie,

02:46.333 --> 02:47.800
he's a master huntsmen.

02:47.900 --> 02:51.267
- [crash]

02:51.367 --> 02:54.433
- RONNIE: I waste nothing
of my prey.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.400
The breast of a blue jay
behind the sternum,

02:56.500 --> 02:59.167
you can just scoop out...eat.

02:59.267 --> 03:01.067
- Why didn't you
just swim to shore?

03:01.133 --> 03:02.400
I mean, the lake isn't that big.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.433
- Amnesia, babe.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.667
Forgot I could swim.

03:04.767 --> 03:08.400
Anyway, seconds
turn into minutes.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.900
Minutes into hours.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.200
Hours into weeks.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.667
Weeks into months.

03:15.767 --> 03:17.367
Months--
- For God's sake, Ronnie,

03:17.467 --> 03:19.867
just get to the part
where you got off the island.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.067
- RONNIE: Fine.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.900
Old Ronnie didn't think
he was gonna make it.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.367
He was down and out.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.967
Having nothing to hold onto.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.333
And that's when it happened.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.067
Bright light
shooting through the sky.

03:31.133 --> 03:35.600
A flaming beacon came soaring
above like a phoenix guiding me.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.400
It led me
to the edge of the island.

03:38.500 --> 03:43.500
To the edge of my sanity.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.867
Anyway, when I got there,

03:44.967 --> 03:47.567
everything just
kinda came rushing back.

03:47.667 --> 03:51.967
- *

03:57.833 --> 03:59.267
- [bell rings]

03:59.367 --> 04:01.367
- Ronnie's back!

04:01.467 --> 04:04.300
I'm back, baby!

04:04.400 --> 04:06.167
- *

04:07.433 --> 04:08.767
- I can't believe it.

04:08.867 --> 04:11.067
- In a way, you fulfilled
my dying wishes.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.567
It brought me back to life.

04:12.667 --> 04:13.800
Not to nitpick or anything,

04:13.900 --> 04:15.900
but you're supposed
to set that stuff on fire.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.267
- Too bad I missed.

04:17.367 --> 04:20.067
- So...what's new
with you, babe?

04:20.167 --> 04:23.067
- [dogs barking]

04:23.133 --> 04:25.267
- So, you guys
have a lot to catch up on.

04:25.367 --> 04:26.800
I'd love to stay,
but I'm late for school.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.467
Really glad you're okay, Ronnie.

04:28.567 --> 04:31.433
- Uh, I'm gonna go in
the kitchen and make some coffee

04:31.533 --> 04:33.867
and maybe a coffeecake
to go with it.

04:38.533 --> 04:39.500
- What was all that about?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.633
- I have no idea.

04:41.733 --> 04:42.900
Let me go check on her.

04:43.067 --> 04:45.833
- *

04:53.833 --> 04:54.900
- Walt...

04:55.067 --> 04:56.800
anyone playing in here
is going to be too drunk

04:56.900 --> 04:59.800
to notice if it's off
by a millimeter or two.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.700
- Respectfully, I would notice.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.833
You might as well
not even have a pool table.

05:04.933 --> 05:06.567
- Suit yourself.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.700
I'll buy you a beer
when you're done.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.200
- Sweet.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.267
- [laughs]
Science class is over.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.067
Somebody get rid
of all these toys.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.800
Where's Kenny?
Kenny, what are you doing?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.800
I thought you were
holding this pool table for us.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.067
- No, I was.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.900
He must have come in
when I went out for lattes.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.167
- Damn it, Kenny.

05:31.267 --> 05:33.200
Secure the pool table
means secure the pool table.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.733
It doesn't mean getting lattes.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.367
- But you're the one
who told me--

05:36.467 --> 05:38.533
- Kenny, no--I hate you
so much right now.

05:38.633 --> 05:40.867
- Guys, please, like
five more minutes, I'll be done.

05:40.967 --> 05:43.267
- Five more minutes.
Kenny, sugar packet.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.533
Lift it.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.500
Lower it.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.267
- [machine beeps]

05:51.367 --> 05:52.367
- Well I'll be damned.

05:52.467 --> 05:53.733
- That's right.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.967
I don't need fancy mirrors
and lasers, Walt.

05:56.067 --> 05:59.500
I got the eyes
of a golden eagle.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.900
[high-pitched squealing]

06:06.667 --> 06:07.633
Now beat it.

06:07.733 --> 06:10.067
- It's a free country...
allegedly.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.800
I can do what I want.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.367
I happen to have an appointment
right now,

06:13.467 --> 06:14.500
which is
just purely coincidence.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.067
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, we got it.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.067
Kenny, rack 'em.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.200
- What about my equipment?
- No worry,

06:19.300 --> 06:21.200
we'll make sure
Kaitlynn gets it behind the bar.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.067
- To be clear, I'm leaving
of my own volition.

06:23.167 --> 06:24.867
- Uh-huh, get to
your fake appointment. We know.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.067
- It's not a fake appointment.
- Oh yeah? Who's it with?

06:27.167 --> 06:28.800
- Some doctors.
- Doctors? A bunch of doctors?

06:28.900 --> 06:30.100
- Yeah, my tooth hurts.
- Uh-huh.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.933
You probably need a dentist,
you "maroon."

06:32.067 --> 06:33.200
- [bell dings]

06:33.300 --> 06:35.533
- I can't believe we actually
skipped school.

06:35.633 --> 06:38.867
I feel so free and dangerous.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.567
Like "Orange is the New Black."

06:40.667 --> 06:42.400
- Okay, okay, okay, but I
can't skip fifth anymore.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.633
Mr. Wallace
is getting suspicious.

06:43.733 --> 06:45.133
We'll have to be back for math.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.267
I mean, if I skip anymore, I'm
literally gonna get suspended.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.333
And my mom's gonna kill me.

06:48.433 --> 06:51.333
- Okay.
- [crash]

06:51.433 --> 06:53.233
- Oh, so sorry. I'll--I'll--

06:56.267 --> 06:57.967
- Oh my God.

06:58.067 --> 07:01.133
- *

07:01.233 --> 07:02.600
- Ooh, T.Rex.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.067
A Glam Rock fan?

07:04.167 --> 07:06.567
- I mean, how can you say no
to a man

07:06.667 --> 07:08.100
in thigh highs and face paint?

07:08.200 --> 07:11.633
- Hey, did you know the actual
T.Rex couldn't play the guitar?

07:11.733 --> 07:13.067
Tiny arms.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.433
- [laughs]

07:14.533 --> 07:16.633
You know, I bet they were pretty
killer at the ukulele though.

07:16.733 --> 07:17.767
- Good one.

07:17.867 --> 07:20.533
- Oh, hello, Yoko.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.700
- Wow, how've you been?

07:22.800 --> 07:24.367
- If you're asking
if I've recovered

07:24.467 --> 07:26.467
from you breaking up my band
by dumping our drummer,

07:26.567 --> 07:27.933
the answer is no.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.300
- You know they didn't break up?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.267
I'm pretty sure they're touring
the West Coast right now.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.467
- What?

07:32.567 --> 07:33.567
No, they're not.

07:33.667 --> 07:35.067
Asher said we broke up.

07:35.167 --> 07:40.200
I don't mean he lied me.
And why would he lie--

07:40.300 --> 07:42.100
Oh God.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.233
Oh Christ.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.700
I'm out of the band.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.800
- I'm sorry,
I thought they told you.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.867
- I have to make a phone call.

07:49.967 --> 07:50.967
- Yoko.

07:51.067 --> 07:53.800
Mm, must have been
a rough breakup.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.667
- I can be Yoko, too.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.667
I was dating the lead singer.

07:58.767 --> 08:01.333
Charlotte, who's our friend?

08:01.433 --> 08:04.933
- Oh, um...you know,that's
actually a good question.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.400
I don't think I got your name.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.600
- Lloy Danderson.

08:07.700 --> 08:08.833
- Hi, Lloyd.

08:08.933 --> 08:11.833
- Uh no, It's actually
Lloy Danderson.

08:11.933 --> 08:13.200
- Lloyd Anderson.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.533
- Lloy--
- Danderson.

08:14.633 --> 08:15.767
- Exactly.

08:15.867 --> 08:18.067
- I feel like we're saying
the same thing.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.067
- We're not.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.300
- Wow.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.333
- You think that's confusing,
my sister's name is Ann.

08:23.433 --> 08:25.067
- [laughs]

08:25.100 --> 08:27.633
- Hey, if you would like to
continue this conversation

08:27.733 --> 08:31.067
of music and dinosaurs, um,
what do you say

08:31.100 --> 08:33.933
we hit the bar down the street
and get a couple drinks?

08:34.067 --> 08:35.800
- Yeah.
- Oh, we're actually 16--

08:35.900 --> 08:40.533
- Sixteen minutes late to, uh,
college stuff and class.

08:40.633 --> 08:44.233
And, um, you know,
another time maybe?

08:44.333 --> 08:45.333
- Definitely, yeah.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.233
Um, hey, can I get your number?

08:47.333 --> 08:49.067
- Excuse me, Charlotte.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.767
Do you know how long
they're out on tour?

08:51.867 --> 08:56.200
I loaned them my van, so...okay.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.900
Just one more thing.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.467
- *

08:59.567 --> 09:03.267
- [razor buzzing]

09:08.067 --> 09:10.200
- Come on, babe, hell's
bells, you gotta tell him.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.967
- I know, I know.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.267
I'm just not sure how to do it.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.267
- It's like
ripping on a Band-Aid

09:16.367 --> 09:17.567
or pissing in public.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.300
The faster you do it,
the better it goes every time.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.567
- Yeah, you're right.

09:21.667 --> 09:22.967
Okay.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.667
- Just remember,
I'm right behind you.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.267
- Thank you, Vernon.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.867
That's a lot of hair.

09:30.967 --> 09:32.567
What's left looks nice though.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.367
- I've been dreaming
about two things.

09:34.467 --> 09:35.900
Getting a greasy hamburger,

09:36.067 --> 09:37.800
getting my kickass pompadour
back.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.067
- I can make you a hamburger.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.400
That's a really good idea.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.833
- No, hold on.

09:41.933 --> 09:44.300
We all just ate
an entire coffeecake.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.200
There's no way anybody
could still be hungry.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.300
Besides, I think there's
something you should

09:49.400 --> 09:51.467
get off your chest.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.167
- Something you wanna tell me?

09:53.267 --> 09:55.133
- *

09:55.233 --> 09:57.433
- I can't think
of anything offhand.

09:57.533 --> 10:02.767
- Um...maybe something that
concerns a certain someone

10:02.867 --> 10:07.667
who will go unnamed until
we think of a name for it.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.533
- It's not an it, it's a baby.

10:09.633 --> 10:12.367
- Who's having a baby?

10:12.467 --> 10:13.633
- I am, Ronnie.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.533
I'm pregnant.
- [razor shuts off]

10:16.633 --> 10:18.433
- I'm gonna be a dad?

10:18.533 --> 10:20.267
I'm gonna be the best dad ever.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.967
- Or maybe stepdad.

10:22.067 --> 10:23.733
- Yeah, it's pretty crazy, huh?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.267
- You must have been so scared

10:25.367 --> 10:26.900
when I was out there
in the wilderness.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.300
You'd have to raise
the baby alone.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.800
- Well, maybe not alone.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.400
- Vernon?
- What?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.000
Is something wrong with my baby?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.233
- The baby might be Vernon's.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.767
- *

10:43.133 --> 10:43.900
- *

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
- DEBBIE: Ronnie, come on.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.400
- VERNON: How long
is this gonna last?

10:46.500 --> 10:47.700
- DEBBIE: You're certainly
not helping.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.067
- He's laying
on the damn remote.

10:49.167 --> 10:50.500
- Ronnie, come on, alright.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.600
Just say something.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.100
I know this is hard, just--

10:53.200 --> 10:54.733
- Okay.

10:54.833 --> 10:56.433
I've had
the entire commercial break

10:56.533 --> 10:57.700
to think about it.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.067
- [dog barking]

11:00.100 --> 11:01.900
- And I'm cool
with what happened.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.167
I know you thought I was dead,

11:04.267 --> 11:08.067
and he preyed
on your vulnerable state.

11:08.133 --> 11:11.533
- Um...actually, it happened
before you went missing.

11:11.633 --> 11:12.933
- What? Don't tell me

11:13.067 --> 11:15.467
you defiled our common law bed
with this seductor.

11:15.567 --> 11:19.167
- I would never defile
your common law bed.

11:19.267 --> 11:21.533
It all happened
on a really cool boat.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.267
- Oh my God!

11:23.367 --> 11:24.433
Why?

11:24.533 --> 11:25.467
- A really cool boat.

11:25.567 --> 11:27.467
- DEBBIE: Vernon.
- A fast, cool boat.

11:27.567 --> 11:30.767
- I gotta know the details.
Tell me everything.

11:30.867 --> 11:33.733
- Well, just think
"Debbie Does Dallas"

11:33.833 --> 11:35.233
meets "Jaws" meets--

11:35.333 --> 11:37.400
- Ronnie, listen, alright,
we were just--we were

11:37.500 --> 11:39.833
really really drunk, okay--
- No! No!

11:39.933 --> 11:41.900
The details about the boat!

11:42.067 --> 11:43.600
Was it inboard motor,
outboard motor?

11:43.700 --> 11:46.400
Twenty footer, twenty-four--
- What does it even matter?

11:46.500 --> 11:47.933
- 'Cause you're
a bad girlfriend.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.500
- Well, you're a butthole.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.900
You see, you care more about
your boats and karates

11:53.067 --> 11:56.133
than you do about being there
for me.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.933
- Well, I'm here now
for the baby!

11:58.067 --> 11:59.067
- Oh great.

11:59.167 --> 12:01.433
- But I'm moving...
into the basement.

12:01.533 --> 12:02.467
- Perfect.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.400
- Uh-oh, problem.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.633
Technically, you said I could
live in the basement.

12:06.733 --> 12:07.767
- What?

12:07.867 --> 12:08.900
You two are so disgusting,

12:09.067 --> 12:10.967
I can't even
look at you right now.

12:11.067 --> 12:12.500
- Alright, you know what?
I'm calling my doctor

12:12.600 --> 12:14.267
and seeing if she can
get me into today

12:14.367 --> 12:15.933
and do a paternity test
or something.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.800
- Listen up, muchacho.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.733
Time for you to make like
one of my shirts and takeoff.

12:20.833 --> 12:23.533
- As long as I may be the
potential father of this child,

12:23.633 --> 12:27.467
I'm sticking around
like brown on rice.

12:27.567 --> 12:30.233
- I guess we're just gonna
have to agree to disagree.

12:30.333 --> 12:34.633
'Cause I want you to know
that I agree with me.

12:34.733 --> 12:36.300
And I'm staying in the basement.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.500
- I say whoever the doctor says
the real father is

12:39.600 --> 12:40.900
gets to stay.

12:41.067 --> 12:45.067
And whoever the fake father
is--aka you--has to move out.

12:45.133 --> 12:48.200
- In the meantime,
I'm gonna be in my basement.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.067
- *

12:51.100 --> 12:52.600
- Am I going the right way?

12:52.700 --> 12:54.633
- Keep going. It's far.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.267
- [loud crash]

12:56.367 --> 12:58.733
- That dumb son of a bitch.

12:58.833 --> 12:59.833
- WALT: Hey, Dale.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.200
- This looks good.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.700
- Place looks great, man.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.433
- Thank you, thank you.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.833
- WALT: Had another run-n
with Reggie and them today.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.367
Bunch of bull -- .

13:08.467 --> 13:10.367
I don't know what to do.
They keep harassing me.

13:10.467 --> 13:14.300
It's like I can't go anywhere,
and they show up.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.833
- When confronted
by an opponent,

13:16.933 --> 13:19.233
one must conquer them with love.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.167
- Yeah, it sounds great but
does it actually work though?

13:21.267 --> 13:22.633
- Are you calling Gandhi a liar?

13:22.733 --> 13:25.067
- No, I'm just saying
like I'm not sure that

13:25.133 --> 13:27.067
Reggie and them
are gonna respond to love.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.667
And I'm not sure I wanna
activate that emotion

13:28.767 --> 13:30.267
when I'm around them
in the first place.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.800
- Well, I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.067
Ooh. Are those dumplings?

13:35.100 --> 13:36.600
- Yeah.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.167
- Come on, hit me, come on.
- Dale.

13:39.267 --> 13:40.567
- DALE: Come on,
right here, right here.

13:40.667 --> 13:41.933
- You know this makes me
uncomfortable.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.733
- Just one.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.233
- [sighs]

13:46.333 --> 13:48.367
- That's what I'm talking about.
Here. Right here.

13:48.467 --> 13:51.800
- *

13:51.900 --> 13:53.067
- NURSE: Hi there.
- Hi.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.200
- What's the reason
for today's visit?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.833
- Um, I--
- Yes, Ma'am,

13:55.933 --> 13:57.233
I have this massive pain
in my ass,

13:57.333 --> 13:58.900
and I'd love to have him
removed.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.900
- [laughs] I'm staying
in that ass.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.667
- Eew.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.067
- [whispers] Actually, I'm here
about a paternity test.

14:06.167 --> 14:08.367
- Sorry, what was that?

14:08.467 --> 14:10.233
- [whispers] I'm here
to take a paternity test.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.833
- I'm sorry, miss,
I still can't hear you.

14:11.933 --> 14:15.967
- She wants to know
which one of us knocked her up.

14:16.067 --> 14:17.300
- Lucky you.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.700
Take a seat and fill this out.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.933
- Wow, that's definitely my boy.

14:25.067 --> 14:27.667
- That's a leg, Mr. Brown.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.700
Based on the measurements
of the ultrasound,

14:29.800 --> 14:32.733
the child is between
14 and 16 weeks.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.833
The genitals are not
fully formed yet.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.500
- Maybe it's yours after all.

14:36.600 --> 14:39.767
- Is there no way we can
just narrow that window down

14:39.867 --> 14:41.100
a little bit?

14:41.200 --> 14:43.300
- Geriatric pregnancy is
too risky for a paternity test.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.467
- Can you use a nicer term?

14:45.567 --> 14:48.833
- You're far more likely
to have a low-weight birth,

14:48.933 --> 14:50.433
even chromosome abnormalities.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.967
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you mean like superpowers?

14:53.067 --> 14:54.367
Like my kid's gonna be a mutant?

14:54.467 --> 14:55.833
Like the cool comic book kind?

14:55.933 --> 14:58.333
- You'd be amazed at how often
I get that question.

14:58.433 --> 15:00.200
- If this baby
has chromosome problems,

15:00.300 --> 15:01.567
it's definitely yours.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.333
- Perhaps you two
could take a fertility test.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.400
- I like that.
- It only takes a few minutes.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.333
- There's no way
anybody's taking my blood.

15:07.433 --> 15:10.333
- It's not a blood test, sir.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.767
- [indistinct whispering]

15:13.867 --> 15:15.900
- Wait,
but how do they collect the--

15:16.067 --> 15:18.700
- [indistinct whispering]

15:18.800 --> 15:21.200
- Aaah.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.600
Alright, I can get into that.

15:26.233 --> 15:28.067
- If you two
will follow me, please.

15:28.167 --> 15:30.467
- *

15:30.567 --> 15:32.533
- No cheating, Haus.
I'm watching you.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.667
- That's a really weird
thing to say to somebody

15:34.767 --> 15:36.867
under these circumstances.
You know that, right?

15:36.967 --> 15:39.800
- *

15:39.900 --> 15:43.067
- Uh, nurse, have you got
any visual aids,

15:43.133 --> 15:44.933
if you know what I mean?

15:45.067 --> 15:47.400
- We have adult magazines, yes.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.933
- You mean like
"The New Yorker"?

15:49.067 --> 15:50.533
- Uh, excuse me, nurse,

15:50.633 --> 15:54.333
but my "carpet" tunnel syndrome
has flared up.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.400
I was kinda wondering
if you might give me

15:56.500 --> 15:57.467
a little hand in there?

15:57.567 --> 16:00.600
- Sure.
Hey, Nurse Beasley!

16:00.700 --> 16:03.233
Mr. Brown could use
a hand in room four.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.667
- [glove snaps]

16:04.767 --> 16:07.133
- Actually, I just remembered,
I got two hands.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.233
So, um, I'm ambidextrous.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.567
I should be fine.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.700
Uh, I appreciate it though,
thank you.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.733
- These guys.

16:14.833 --> 16:16.500
- [knocking at door]
- Coming in.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.467
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.600
I'm sorry,
I didn't know you started.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.733
- All done.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.167
- I'll be taking that still
though.

16:30.267 --> 16:31.967
Mm.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.833
- I didn't think that was
gonna go in, but then it did.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.067
- How can somebody so dumb
be so good at pool?

16:39.167 --> 16:40.267
- I don't know.

16:40.367 --> 16:43.667
Maybe I'm one of them
idiot geniuses.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.233
- You're so stupid
you don't even realize

16:45.333 --> 16:46.533
you're making fun of yourself.

16:46.633 --> 16:50.067
- Oh, maybe
that's the genius part.

16:50.167 --> 16:51.267
- Boys.

16:51.367 --> 16:53.367
Little peace offering.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.400
- Thought I told you
to get lost.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.600
Looks like you know
exactly where you are.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.067
- Look, I know we've had
our differences in the past,

17:07.167 --> 17:10.067
but I thought maybe we could
all try to live together

17:10.167 --> 17:11.800
cohesively like tribal people.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.133
- Hey, Kenny,
check the log book.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.667
When's the last time we lived
cohesively with someone?

17:15.767 --> 17:17.800
- Well, I don't think that's
the kind of stats that we--

17:17.900 --> 17:20.300
- Damn it, Kenny,
I was being rhetorical. Dang!

17:20.400 --> 17:21.833
Let's take this outside!

17:21.933 --> 17:23.733
Let's go!

17:23.833 --> 17:25.467
- Hey, yo, guys!

17:25.567 --> 17:28.267
You can't take alcohol
outside the premises.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.133
Come on.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.333
Come on, chuggy chuggy.

17:33.433 --> 17:37.500
- BOTH: [gulping]

17:40.533 --> 17:43.433
- [burps] Sorry.

17:43.533 --> 17:46.600
- Okay. Okay.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.267
Good luck with your society.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.767
Find a woman.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.967
- *

17:55.067 --> 17:57.933
- Look, guys, I don't
wanna resort to violence.

17:58.067 --> 18:01.067
- Oh, look out, boys,
he's gonna resort to violence.

18:01.133 --> 18:03.867
- Kenny, just leave
the mockery to me, okay?

18:03.967 --> 18:06.167
Besides, your comebacks
are childish.

18:06.267 --> 18:07.433
It lacks subtlety.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.200
[clears throat]

18:09.300 --> 18:12.267
Alright, butt face,
time to teach you a lesson.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.733
- [growls]

18:20.233 --> 18:21.533
Hey, guys...

18:21.633 --> 18:23.200
mine leaving my buddy alone?

18:23.300 --> 18:24.633
- What's this, Walt?

18:24.733 --> 18:26.467
You can't fight your own fights?

18:26.567 --> 18:28.067
You need to be saved
by this freak show?

18:28.167 --> 18:31.633
- No, really,
leave my buddy alone.

18:31.733 --> 18:35.533
- Why don't you
take a hike, fake--

18:37.433 --> 18:40.067
It's nice. Is that a wool blend?

18:40.100 --> 18:42.067
- That's cute.

18:42.100 --> 18:44.133
- [crush]

18:44.233 --> 18:46.267
- *

18:46.367 --> 18:47.333
- Kenny!

18:47.433 --> 18:49.067
- Leave him! He's already dead!

18:49.133 --> 18:50.933
He resorted to violence!

18:51.067 --> 18:52.300
Guys!

18:52.400 --> 18:53.533
- That was incredible!

18:53.633 --> 18:55.067
- KENNY: It's in my eyes!

18:55.167 --> 18:57.333
Grab me a glass of water!

18:57.433 --> 18:59.700
- Yeah, I got a fertility test
a couple of years ago.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.600
The doctor looked me
right in the eye and said,

19:01.700 --> 19:03.667
"Mitch, you're barren."

19:03.767 --> 19:05.433
Cynthia on the hand
has experienced

19:05.533 --> 19:08.133
Immaculate Conception
like three times.

19:08.233 --> 19:11.267
Looking back on it now, I think
she was cheating on me.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.867
- Nah. So, Doily,

19:12.967 --> 19:15.133
sounds like
she's still pining for you.

19:15.233 --> 19:16.500
- Does sound like that,
doesn't it?

19:16.600 --> 19:17.667
- Oh, so sad.

19:17.767 --> 19:18.833
- Showtime!
- Hey!

19:18.933 --> 19:21.533
How did it shake out, boys?

19:21.633 --> 19:22.933
- You got the results?

19:23.067 --> 19:24.767
- Yes, I do.

19:24.867 --> 19:26.567
Let's just remember the deal.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.733
Loser has to move out
of the basement, pal.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.433
- Oh, I remember.

19:30.533 --> 19:32.167
Ladies first.

19:34.267 --> 19:35.267
- Ha!

19:35.367 --> 19:37.500
My sperm are swimming like
Michael Phelps

19:37.600 --> 19:39.867
going for his 19th gold medal
down in Rio.

19:39.967 --> 19:41.333
Whoo, whoo.
- [laughs]

19:42.633 --> 19:43.867
- Ronnie?

19:43.967 --> 19:45.600
- Who wants to get pregnant?

19:45.700 --> 19:47.500
- Uh, nobody.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.667
- I call top bunk.

19:48.767 --> 19:50.467
- There's no way
you're getting top bunk.

19:50.567 --> 19:52.867
- Ronnie, Vernon, sit down!

19:56.733 --> 19:59.067
Okay, look, one of you
is the father of this baby.

19:59.133 --> 20:02.567
But apparently we're not
gonna know who anytime soon.

20:02.667 --> 20:05.733
So I'm okay with both of you
living at my house.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.967
But not if you're gonna just
continue to taunt each other

20:09.067 --> 20:11.567
like--like those stupid
fake wrestlers you love.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.467
- That's not fake.
- I thought it was real.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.767
- Whatever,
this isn't a contest, alright?

20:15.867 --> 20:17.667
And the fighting isn't good
for me or the baby.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.433
So either get along or get out.

20:19.533 --> 20:21.200
It's up to y'all.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.333
- Eee-ee-eee.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.900
- *

20:30.000 --> 20:32.433
- We need to pull it together

20:32.533 --> 20:35.000
for Deb, the baby.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.133
I call truce.

20:39.233 --> 20:41.033
- It doesn't mean I like you.
- Ditto.

20:41.133 --> 20:42.967
- Good.
- Great.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.900
- I never washed my hands
at the clinic.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.900
- [groans] Thanks, Mom.

20:52.933 --> 20:54.767
- Well, it looks like things
are gonna be weird

20:54.867 --> 20:56.433
for a few more months.

20:56.533 --> 20:59.500
- I kinda like the chaos.
I'm proud of you.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.567
- Hey, kids.
Do you mind if join you?

21:01.667 --> 21:02.900
- Ronnie and I
have discussed it,

21:03.067 --> 21:06.067
and we've decided
to bury the hatchet.

21:06.100 --> 21:07.267
- Thank you.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.867
- For now, hombre.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.933
- Bury the hatchet in your ass.

21:11.067 --> 21:13.500
- Hey, is it too late to call
dips on being the godfather?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.900
- I'm not sure
that's dips-able.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.567
- I'd like to make a toast.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.400
To Debbie...

21:18.500 --> 21:20.767
A strong woman, good mother,

21:20.867 --> 21:23.133
and the glue that holds
this family together.

21:23.233 --> 21:24.267
- To family!

21:24.367 --> 21:25.367
- To family!

21:25.467 --> 21:28.167
- To my family!

21:28.267 --> 21:29.533
Amigo.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.300
Uh, son of a--

21:32.400 --> 21:33.900
- Not on the homework.

21:34.067 --> 21:35.067
- My bad.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.067
- RONNIE: I'm coming, Deb!

21:42.067 --> 21:44.400
Deb, wait for me!

21:45.933 --> 21:49.433
[heavy breathing]

21:57.833 --> 21:59.900
Wait for me!

22:02.833 --> 22:04.133
- [girl laughs]
