00:02.494 --> 00:06.202
Do you remember that you
asked me to get you

00:06.203 --> 00:09.422
ELO tickets? Hmm?

00:09.423 --> 00:13.513
So annoying people can't recycle.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.620
Like, what the actual fuck?

00:17.566 --> 00:20.346
Okay, so, do you not want to go anymore?

00:20.347 --> 00:22.435
Mom, I'm in the middle of something.

00:22.436 --> 00:25.787
Okay, so what night
would you like to go?

00:25.788 --> 00:27.876
What are you talking about?

00:27.877 --> 00:29.770
Hey. Mm-hmm.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.231
Yeah, what time?

00:35.232 --> 00:37.380
Uh-huh.

00:45.401 --> 00:48.895
Mom! Mom!

00:50.911 --> 00:52.241
Mom!

01:00.714 --> 01:02.984
Yes? H-How may I help you?

01:03.766 --> 01:05.394
I'm going to Melrose with Jason.

01:05.394 --> 01:08.591
Do you have any money so I can
get... lunch or something?

01:11.943 --> 01:14.843
Okay. Frankie.

01:15.555 --> 01:18.796
I was trying to be nice by
getting you tickets to a show

01:18.797 --> 01:21.755
that you begged me to
get you tickets for.

01:21.756 --> 01:24.098
Then you were rude, and then,

01:24.099 --> 01:27.839
you ask me for money
without even apologizing.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.530
Do you think that's a fair assessment

01:29.531 --> 01:31.113
of what just happened?

01:33.954 --> 01:37.153
Frankie, this is where you say,

01:37.154 --> 01:41.079
"Mom, I'm sorry for being a little dick,

01:41.080 --> 01:44.082
and I really appreciate you
getting me the tickets

01:44.083 --> 01:45.953
and taking the time.

01:45.954 --> 01:48.072
Also, may I please

01:48.073 --> 01:50.116
have some spending money?"

01:51.056 --> 01:53.114
Fine. Don't give me the money.

01:53.115 --> 01:54.832
I'll get some weirdo to buy me lunch

01:54.833 --> 01:56.158
and maybe he'll traffic me

01:56.159 --> 01:58.382
and you can live with that
for the rest of your life.

Mom. Mom, I'm trapped. Mom?

02:12.083 --> 02:13.807
Mom, are you out there?

02:13.808 --> 02:15.418
Mom, let me out.

02:15.419 --> 02:17.008
Mom! I can't get out!

02:36.129 --> 02:38.200
Hi. Oh.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.730
Hi, Sam. Thanks for the
marinated ribs last Tuesday.

02:41.731 --> 02:45.274
Um, oh, God. So embarrassing.

02:45.275 --> 02:48.233
You didn't have to bringthe
truck. I mean, is this okay?

02:48.234 --> 02:49.388
Is it out of bounds

02:49.389 --> 02:51.236
to call you guys for
something like this?

02:51.237 --> 02:53.069
No, it's standard procedure,
it's what we're here for.

02:53.070 --> 02:55.110
You won't believe the things
people call us about.

02:55.111 --> 02:56.351
Right, Cap?

02:57.233 --> 02:59.810
All right. Come on through.

02:59.811 --> 03:02.944
I'll show you where the emergency is.

03:02.945 --> 03:05.317
It's Frankie's room. Thank you.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.997
Hi. Sorry. Thanks.

03:14.998 --> 03:17.720
My pleasure. Must've been the wind, huh?

03:18.236 --> 03:20.196
Seems to have been slammed pretty hard.

03:20.776 --> 03:24.084
These old doors, they
get stuck all the time.

03:25.334 --> 03:29.208
- Okay. You're free.
- Thanks, guys.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.817
- Bye, now.
- Take care.

03:31.818 --> 03:33.042
Happy Mother's Day.

03:36.142 --> 03:37.617
You're welcome!

03:39.916 --> 03:42.919
Ugh.

03:49.183 --> 03:51.885
Okay.

04:16.127 --> 04:19.216
And so it begins. Come on, Chewy.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.770
Okay.

04:30.771 --> 04:35.688
"Pour half of the MiraLAX solution...

Blah, blah, blah.

04:51.077 --> 04:54.946
"Mix with any clear liquid,

04:54.947 --> 04:56.428

Hello. Hi, Dr. Santoro.

05:29.526 --> 05:32.093
Hi, Sam, how are you doing?

05:32.094 --> 05:33.833
Thank you for calling me back.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.314
I'm sorry to bother you. I
didn't mean to disturb you.

05:36.315 --> 05:38.489
- Am I disturbing you?
- It's fine.

05:38.490 --> 05:42.213
My daughter is visiting
me from out of town.

05:42.214 --> 05:44.540
So, how are you doing?

05:44.541 --> 05:46.803
- Any movement?
- Nope.

05:46.804 --> 05:50.633
There's no movement yet.
Nothing, no poop, no caca.

05:50.634 --> 05:51.982
It'll come.

05:51.983 --> 05:54.139
You have to push liquids for now.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.291
Ha! Field of Dreams.

05:56.292 --> 05:58.641
If you push them, shit will come.

05:58.642 --> 06:00.643
Sam.

06:00.644 --> 06:02.766
You're wonderful.

06:02.767 --> 06:04.342
Thank you so much, Dr. Santoro.

06:04.343 --> 06:06.341
I'll see you tomorrow
for my big opening!

06:06.342 --> 06:09.256
Have a good night, Sam.

06:09.257 --> 06:11.150
See you tomorrow.

06:11.151 --> 06:14.439
D...

06:14.440 --> 06:16.307
Oh my God.

06:16.308 --> 06:18.725
This woman is crazy. But I love her.

06:20.011 --> 06:21.664
Oh, wait.

06:21.665 --> 06:24.298
Here we go.

06:26.431 --> 06:29.390
Nope. Nothing.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.244
"A sheepdog had not a good master,

06:36.245 --> 06:39.650
"but, on the contrary, one
who let him suffer hunger.

06:39.651 --> 06:42.467
"As he could stay no longer with him,

06:42.468 --> 06:44.382
- he went quite sadly..."
- Oh.

06:44.383 --> 06:46.123
Oh.

06:46.124 --> 06:47.385
Honey? Honey?

06:47.386 --> 06:49.126
I love you. I love you.

06:49.127 --> 06:50.954
Good night. Mm!

06:50.955 --> 06:52.390
I love you. Finish the book.

06:52.391 --> 06:54.131
I love you. Honey, honey.

06:54.132 --> 06:56.612
Mommy's got to go to her own toilet now.

06:56.613 --> 06:57.917
Mom?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.441
You're scaring me.

07:06.775 --> 07:09.320
I put extra toilet paper in
the bathroom for you, Mom.

07:12.063 --> 07:14.934
And don't forget to put
Vaselineon your butthole.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.501
Love you.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.969
Okay, I'm gonna leave them out here.

07:43.986 --> 07:45.704
Yes.

07:45.705 --> 07:47.120
Ooh!

07:56.521 --> 07:59.327
Oh, my God.

08:17.476 --> 08:19.260
No, no, no.

08:19.261 --> 08:21.392
Shoo! Shoo! Out.

09:29.066 --> 09:32.463
But I love nursing still,
'cause I get to be of service.

09:32.464 --> 09:36.467
Yeah. I hear it's harderto
be a nurse than be a doctor.

09:36.468 --> 09:38.426
One hundo-P.

09:38.427 --> 09:40.625
Right this way, ma'am.

09:42.322 --> 09:44.301
- After you.
- Thank you.

09:44.302 --> 09:45.476
Hi, ladies.

09:45.477 --> 09:46.651
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.218
How's everything?

09:48.219 --> 09:50.438
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Good. Thank you.

09:50.439 --> 09:52.527
Oh, you're gonna put an I.V. in, huh?

09:52.528 --> 09:53.464
Yeah.

09:55.117 --> 09:56.792
Okay.

09:58.925 --> 10:00.622
You're okay.

10:00.623 --> 10:02.363
You're okay.

10:02.364 --> 10:04.103
- You're okay.
- You're okay.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.583
- You're totally okay.
- You're okay.

10:05.584 --> 10:07.716
You're so okay.

10:07.717 --> 10:09.587
- You're okay.
- You...

10:09.588 --> 10:10.936
Thank you.

10:10.937 --> 10:12.677
- That was good.
- Good.

10:14.593 --> 10:17.378
Ah. Farsi...

10:17.379 --> 10:19.467
Um, no.

10:19.468 --> 10:22.818
I wish I spoke more Farsi,
but I really like it a lot.

10:22.819 --> 10:24.515
I have... I have a lot of deusts.

10:24.516 --> 10:28.040
My family and I celebrate
Chaharshanbe Suri every year.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.477
Ah, how cool. Chaharshanbe Suri...

10:35.549 --> 10:36.832
- Exactly.
- Huh?

10:38.356 --> 10:39.965
Okay. You did great.

10:39.966 --> 10:42.403
You did great.

10:42.404 --> 10:43.621
How do you say "thank you"?

10:43.622 --> 10:44.753
Say "merci."

10:44.754 --> 10:46.319
Oh, merci. I know.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.625
Merci.

10:47.626 --> 10:49.758
Your doctor's gonna be
with you soon, okay?

10:49.759 --> 10:50.628
Merci.

10:54.285 --> 10:55.546
She's so pretty.

10:55.547 --> 10:56.982
- I know.
- Beautiful.

10:56.983 --> 10:59.507
- Gorgeous. The hair kills me.
- Yeah.

10:59.508 --> 11:01.509
Hi.

11:01.510 --> 11:02.553
Hi.

11:02.554 --> 11:04.076
Hi. I'm Roy.

11:04.077 --> 11:05.643
I'm your nurse anesthetist.

11:05.644 --> 11:08.646
Tell me, are you
allergic to eggs or soy?

11:08.647 --> 11:09.952
Why? Are you gonna cook for me?

11:11.345 --> 11:13.129
That's too funny.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.392
No, those are in one of our solutions.

11:15.393 --> 11:18.569
No, I'm not allergic to those,
but can you please arrange

11:18.570 --> 11:20.571
for a pleasant dream while I'm under?

11:20.572 --> 11:23.661
Oh, that's my specialty, dear.

11:23.662 --> 11:25.469
All right.

11:27.819 --> 11:29.775
Cute.

11:30.778 --> 11:32.693
Okay, Nurse Roy.

11:33.738 --> 11:35.543
You'll have dreams about him.

11:35.544 --> 11:37.545
Guess what my specialty is.

11:43.138 --> 11:44.726
Hi, Sam.

11:44.727 --> 11:46.467
Hi, Dr. Santoro.

11:46.468 --> 11:48.686
Please don't tear my butthole.

11:48.687 --> 11:51.820
You know I do a thousand
of these a year, right?

11:51.821 --> 11:55.040
I don't know why you'd want
to, but okay, if you say so.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.694
All right.

11:56.695 --> 11:59.720
Let's turn you on your left side, hmm?

12:02.418 --> 12:03.745
Is it happening?

12:03.746 --> 12:05.703
Am I on drugs yet?

12:05.704 --> 12:07.705
Not yet, dear. You'll know when.

12:07.706 --> 12:10.708
So, I tell all my creative people

12:10.709 --> 12:13.058
to think of something fabulous.

12:13.059 --> 12:16.627
Think of an idea, and your mind
will go to incredible places.

12:16.628 --> 12:18.586
Think of something specific.

12:18.587 --> 12:19.587
All right.

12:19.588 --> 12:21.066
Go ahead, do me a favor.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.677
Count backwards from five.

12:22.678 --> 12:26.594
Okay. Five, four...

12:42.741 --> 12:46.091
- Mm. Mm.
- Mm, mm.

12:46.092 --> 12:48.856
So good. Delicious.

12:56.712 --> 12:57.755
Yeah. Just take a big swig.

12:57.756 --> 12:59.627
A big swig. All the way.

12:59.628 --> 13:01.716
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

13:10.682 --> 13:13.446
Mm!

13:39.798 --> 13:41.494
Sorry about that.

13:41.495 --> 13:43.345
No problem.

13:44.738 --> 13:46.543
Hi. You okay?

13:46.544 --> 13:48.545
- How you doing?
- Did you hear that?

13:48.546 --> 13:50.808
You okay?

13:50.809 --> 13:52.897
- Yes. I'm great.
- Hi. Hi.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.464
I want to go. I'm ready to go.

13:54.465 --> 13:55.770
- Can we go? Let's go.
- Okay.

13:55.771 --> 13:56.901
Your-your phone has been blowing up.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.468
Max found an apartment in Hollywood,

13:58.469 --> 14:00.296
and she needs you to put a deposit down

14:00.297 --> 14:01.384
in, like, five minutes.

14:01.385 --> 14:02.690
What? Excuse me?

14:02.691 --> 14:05.470
Please, I'm a little busy right now.

14:05.471 --> 14:06.911
- God.
- Hi, Sam. How you feeling?

14:06.912 --> 14:08.696
Hi. Um, good.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.480
Am... are we discharged?

14:10.481 --> 14:12.482
Well, I'm really glad we did this.

14:12.483 --> 14:13.930
Let me pull up a chair.

14:13.931 --> 14:15.850
Ohp. Oh. The chair slide.

14:15.851 --> 14:18.096
She's getting a chair.
She's coming in close.

14:18.097 --> 14:20.490
- That's not good, Sunny.
- It's okay. I'm right here.

14:20.491 --> 14:22.820
Okay. See this?

14:24.517 --> 14:26.148
That is a polyp.

14:26.149 --> 14:27.845
I have a polyp?

14:27.846 --> 14:29.368
Two of 'em.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.718
Here and here.

14:30.719 --> 14:32.371
- See it?
- Mm-hmm.

14:33.765 --> 14:37.072
So I removed the polyps,
and I tattooed both areas

14:37.073 --> 14:40.771
just so I know where they are
next time I go back in there.

14:40.772 --> 14:43.121
- I have tattoos now.
- Two of 'em.

14:43.122 --> 14:45.123
There was also another thing.

14:45.124 --> 14:49.214
See this red ridge that's
up near your appendix?

14:49.215 --> 14:51.652
So I scraped that off, I took samples,

14:51.653 --> 14:54.089
I looked at it on a plate.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.613
It probably is nothing.

14:56.614 --> 15:00.356
- But it could be a malignant...
- Wait, what?

15:00.357 --> 15:01.879
...polyp.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.359
- Mmm.
- If it is,

15:03.360 --> 15:05.013
it means that I would have to
gothrough your bellybutton

15:05.014 --> 15:06.971
and remove it laparoscopically.

15:06.972 --> 15:10.758
Easily extricated and done
in an outpatient procedure.

15:16.074 --> 15:17.430
Polyp.

15:18.110 --> 15:21.464
Polyp. Polyp is a funny word.

15:21.465 --> 15:23.771
I mean, not really so
much in this instance,

15:23.772 --> 15:26.904
pertaining to me, but... Polyp, though.

15:26.905 --> 15:29.907
Ps are funny.

15:29.908 --> 15:31.256
Oy.

15:31.257 --> 15:33.041
- Uh, can we go?
- Can... Yeah.

15:33.042 --> 15:35.783
Because I really want to
get my body over a toilet.

15:35.784 --> 15:37.393
Ah, that's just air.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.960
And yes, you can go.

15:38.961 --> 15:40.788
And have a glass of wine tonight.

15:40.789 --> 15:43.050
You probably have some
anxiety from all this.

15:43.754 --> 15:44.809
I don't.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.272
I mean, I didn't, but
actually, now I do,

15:47.273 --> 15:49.710
and I really do have to poop.

15:49.711 --> 15:51.365
That's just air.

15:51.881 --> 15:53.235
I don't think so.

15:53.236 --> 15:55.063
I don't believe you.

15:55.064 --> 15:57.574
- I can't... this can't possibly...
- Try to get...

15:59.198 --> 16:00.952
Oh.

16:00.953 --> 16:02.418
It was just air.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.029
Sorry.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.857
Oh, God.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.250
- That's better.
- Whoo!

16:08.251 --> 16:10.841
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Dr. Santoro.

16:12.951 --> 16:14.256
In future, Sam:

16:14.257 --> 16:17.041
no tampons, no Q-tips,
no Kleenex, nothing.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.173
Only caca.

16:18.174 --> 16:19.740
We know that, Lev.

16:19.741 --> 16:22.003
We only put caca in the toilets here.

16:22.004 --> 16:24.440
Four ladies in the house
cannot have such big caca.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.615
Impossible.

16:25.616 --> 16:26.834
You don't know these ladies

16:26.835 --> 16:27.901
and you don't know our cacas.

16:29.076 --> 16:31.055
Oh. Oh, here's the nice soap.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.056
Ah, of course.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.624
Yes.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.105
Plus, I need to replace
this toilet, it's old.

16:37.106 --> 16:38.846
You need more horsepower.

16:38.847 --> 16:41.631
Exactly. I'm tired of plunging it.

16:41.632 --> 16:43.633
- How much you want to spend?
- I don't care.

16:43.634 --> 16:46.462
I just want one that is never
gonna clog on me again.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.116
Okay.

16:48.117 --> 16:49.857
If you have YouTube, I
have toilet for you.

16:49.858 --> 16:50.858
I can show you.

16:50.859 --> 16:52.860
Oh.

16:52.861 --> 16:54.362
Okay.

16:56.887 --> 16:58.802
Okay.

17:01.021 --> 17:05.786
Ah, just... put this right there.

17:05.787 --> 17:07.932
Okay, this is Bentley of toilets.

17:07.933 --> 17:10.050
They have in prisons so
criminals cannot flood cells.

17:10.051 --> 17:12.678
Oh, my God! Lev!

17:12.679 --> 17:13.734
Yes!

17:13.736 --> 17:15.230
That's the one!

17:15.231 --> 17:17.013
Amazing, right? Keep watching.

17:17.015 --> 17:19.910
Are those golf balls?

17:21.900 --> 17:24.108
I love this thing!

17:24.108 --> 17:26.719
If you want, you can flush a small dog

17:26.720 --> 17:28.286
or even a kilo of cocaine.

17:28.287 --> 17:29.968
I want it.

17:29.969 --> 17:31.115
I want it. Seriously.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.508
When can I get one?

17:32.509 --> 17:35.054
- I can get one for you and install.
- Thank you.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.472
Uh, tonight I go to Torrance,
and I pick up toilets

17:37.473 --> 17:39.080
and install for you tomorrow.

17:39.081 --> 17:40.255
You're amazing.

17:40.256 --> 17:42.170
High-five, then.

17:42.171 --> 17:44.694
Oh. Lev, you know I can't...

17:44.695 --> 17:45.738
No offense.

17:45.739 --> 17:47.720
- Ah. Uh... None taken.
- Yeah.

17:51.786 --> 17:53.050
So, this is it.

17:53.051 --> 17:54.617
The last session.

17:54.618 --> 17:55.922
Yep.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.286
How do you feel about that?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.799
I don't know, Doc. How
do you feel about it?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.158
I don't know, Ms. Fox, how
do you feel about it?

18:06.870 --> 18:09.859
I feel like...

18:10.786 --> 18:12.192
Xanax tonight?

18:12.193 --> 18:13.962
Hey.

18:13.963 --> 18:18.032
My prescription was for sleep,
anxiety and four sessions.

18:18.033 --> 18:19.054
Ding.

18:19.055 --> 18:20.817
Look, uh...

18:20.818 --> 18:22.558
Uh, these sessions...

18:22.559 --> 18:24.481
I-It's kind of...

18:25.272 --> 18:27.824
Well, it's not kind of,
it's really not okay.

18:27.825 --> 18:29.304
Why?

18:29.305 --> 18:33.090
- It isn't therapy, Sam. And...
- Yes, it is.

18:33.091 --> 18:36.180
I'm sitting here talking,
you're listening...

18:36.181 --> 18:38.804
This is therapy. If this
isn't therapy, what is it?

18:38.805 --> 18:41.454
But you're not talking, Sam. You're not.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.101
And maybe you would have
openedup to some other therapist

18:44.102 --> 18:45.798
who doesn't have a past with you.

18:45.799 --> 18:47.365
I should have referred you out,

18:47.366 --> 18:49.541
I really, really should have.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.078
Hippocratic oath and shit.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.805
Why didn't you and shit?

18:52.806 --> 18:54.178
Why didn't I?

18:55.652 --> 18:56.847
That's a good question.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.194
That's a good... Well, why didn't I?

18:59.196 --> 19:02.554
Well, I guess because I
wanted to see you again.

19:02.555 --> 19:05.946
And I really wasn't thinking
about anything else.

19:05.948 --> 19:09.042
And to think I opened up
all my traumas to you.

19:09.044 --> 19:11.389
You didn't open up anything to me.

19:11.390 --> 19:12.894
Y-You don't want therapy.

19:12.896 --> 19:14.740
Therapy is not for you.

19:14.741 --> 19:17.352
What's that supposed to mean?
I could be good at therapy.

19:17.353 --> 19:19.079
If I tried.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.791
Okay, tell me about your ex-husband.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.227
What? Are you insane?

19:23.228 --> 19:25.032
I'm not talking about that. Ew.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.019
- Tell me about your father.
- No.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.581
- What about your mother?
- Oh, God, no. No way.

19:29.582 --> 19:32.955
Okay, okay, so we're not gonna
talk about your failed marriage,

19:32.957 --> 19:34.407
nothing about your family,

19:34.408 --> 19:36.365
or about your childhood,

19:36.366 --> 19:38.367
or about your sex life

19:38.368 --> 19:39.934
or your dreams.

19:39.935 --> 19:42.023
Nothing about your dating life

19:42.024 --> 19:43.720
or what gives you meaning

19:43.721 --> 19:45.331
or even the loneliness,

19:45.332 --> 19:47.767
the-the loneliness that we all feel.

19:48.412 --> 19:49.524
Nope.

19:50.076 --> 19:53.774
Nope, absolutely... nope.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.950
All right, Sam.

19:55.951 --> 19:59.171
You're being emotional eel slippery.

19:59.172 --> 20:02.348
And I have to say that,
for someone like me,

20:02.349 --> 20:04.959
who-who-who loves to indulge

20:04.960 --> 20:07.469
in talking about everything...

20:08.398 --> 20:10.161
it's kind of hot.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.232
It is?

20:13.234 --> 20:16.666
Yeah, but you're just
playing a game, and...

20:17.304 --> 20:18.718
it's gonna catch up to you.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.306
Yeah, probably.

20:21.759 --> 20:23.238
But not today?

20:23.450 --> 20:25.277
- Nope.
- No.

20:25.279 --> 20:27.236
All right, well, we still have some...

20:27.238 --> 20:28.847
some time left in this session.

20:28.849 --> 20:30.612
How do you want to spend it?

20:34.481 --> 20:36.111
I don't know, Doc.

20:36.113 --> 20:37.470
How do you want to spend it?

20:37.471 --> 20:39.325
Hey, it's your dime.

20:39.326 --> 20:41.772
Uh, it's completely up to you, Sam.

20:41.773 --> 20:44.064
I'll do whatever you tell me.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.046
I'll do...

20:48.047 --> 20:50.787
whatever you tell me.

20:50.788 --> 20:52.354
Well...

20:53.101 --> 20:54.446
well, I want you to come over here

20:54.447 --> 20:56.411
and sit next to me on this bench.

20:57.578 --> 21:02.103
Just like you did on that
benchthat day at Camp Teak,

21:02.104 --> 21:05.694
when we were watchingthe
counselors put on that play.

21:07.044 --> 21:08.631
And I want you to look at me

21:08.632 --> 21:11.808
just like you looked at
me that day, like...

21:11.809 --> 21:13.941
like, "Oops, sorry about that."

21:13.942 --> 21:15.638
But then I want you to
leave your foot there

21:16.507 --> 21:18.087
and not say a word.

21:18.741 --> 21:21.853
Just like you did for the
whole play back then.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.347
That's what I want you to do.

21:25.348 --> 21:26.954
I want you to do that.

21:26.955 --> 21:28.630
Right now.

21:29.675 --> 21:30.820
That would be...

21:31.655 --> 21:33.853
incredibly inappropriate.

21:59.748 --> 22:03.056
I've had blue balls of the heart
for you for over 30 years.

22:04.144 --> 22:05.906
Mm.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.062
And you are officially
fired as my patient.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.766
Mm.

22:18.767 --> 22:22.531
Well, I guess that's all the
time we have for today, Doc.

22:22.532 --> 22:25.339
Okay, I'll just get my...

22:26.601 --> 22:28.690
Thank you.

22:33.277 --> 22:35.105
Oh, my God!

22:36.263 --> 22:37.546
Yes!

22:39.375 --> 22:40.897
Let's try potatoes.

22:40.898 --> 22:42.725
Or a shampoo bottle.

22:42.726 --> 22:44.967
Okay, one more, though.

22:47.535 --> 22:49.384
- What are you doing?
- Mom.

22:49.385 --> 22:51.169
Yo, this thing is incredible.
This is the third towel

22:51.170 --> 22:52.605
we've flushed down this thing.

22:52.606 --> 22:53.806
Frankie.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.174
Why are you flushing our
towels down the toilet?

22:56.175 --> 22:58.176
Mom, can we name the toilet?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.939
It deserves a name like...

22:59.940 --> 23:01.918
Balthazar or Abigail.

23:01.919 --> 23:03.505
Or Slender Man.

23:03.506 --> 23:04.965
I know.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.398
But quit flushing our
towels down the toilet.

23:07.399 --> 23:08.795
- You crazy?
- Last one.

23:08.796 --> 23:10.753
Hey! No!

23:10.754 --> 23:12.952
Quit it!

23:14.944 --> 23:16.759
I don't know you. Who are you?

23:16.760 --> 23:19.414
I'm Quaker, Frankie's friend.

23:19.415 --> 23:21.416
Oh. Hi.

23:21.417 --> 23:23.070
Have fun.

23:23.071 --> 23:24.637
Don't sleep over.

23:24.638 --> 23:26.400
Good night.

23:55.055 --> 23:56.234
Yes.
