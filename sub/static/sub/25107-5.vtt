00:11.428 --> 00:14.055
<i>Michael was on his way</i>
<i>to see Rebel Alley</i>

00:14.139 --> 00:16.683
<i>after being less than honest with his son</i>

00:16.766 --> 00:18.560
<i>about having broken up with her...</i>

00:18.643 --> 00:20.687
I got a cactus, for God's sakes.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.731
That's a universal sign
for "things are over."

00:22.814 --> 00:24.315
<i>...when he'd actually told her...</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:26.317
I ain't going nowhere.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.362
<i>George Michael had similarly</i>
<i>made a false claim.</i>

00:29.446 --> 00:31.823
- Do you have plans with Rebel?
- Yeah.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.950
- Do you? Good for you guys.
- I do, yeah.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.077
- It's fun. Yeah.
<i>- When the truth was...</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:38.121
I haven't seen her since I punched him.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.623
<i>And each was worried</i>
<i>the other would say,</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:42.917
<i>"You lied to me, and that's worse."</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:45.003
He's gonna say, "And that's worse."

00:45.086 --> 00:48.131
<i>Michael decided to tell Rebel</i>
<i>he </i> was <i>going somewhere.</i>

00:48.673 --> 00:52.886
<i>George Michael, meanwhile, was approaching
the same apartment with a plan of his own.</i>

00:52.969 --> 00:55.388
You take my bag of lacy ticklers,
hoo-ha bras, dog toys,

00:55.472 --> 00:57.974
and sex knobs with you,
and you act like you're expecting

00:58.058 --> 01:00.602
a booty call, as the old people
think the young people say.

01:00.685 --> 01:04.272
Tell her, "I'm here for a quickie,
and I'm out of here." Mr. Brash.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.776
<i>So when Michael saw his son</i>
<i>brashly approaching,</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.612
<i>he decided to be the adult
in the relationship</i>

01:10.695 --> 01:13.573
<i>and avoid conflict by squatting in a bush,</i>

01:13.865 --> 01:16.785
<i>until his son passed on his way
to what the young people</i>

01:16.868 --> 01:18.995
<i>refer to as a booty call.</i>

01:19.370 --> 01:21.915
Yeah, standing out here
with a bag of sex toys!

01:21.998 --> 01:25.168
Let's go! Not getting any less horny
out here. How are you?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.045
I think she's gone until tomorrow.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.297
Is she? Good.
'Cause I was getting less,

01:29.380 --> 01:31.925
uh... what I mentioned earlier.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.929
<i>Moments earlier,</i>
<i>a still squatting Michael</i>

01:36.012 --> 01:37.972
<i>noticed something in the bushes.</i>

01:44.229 --> 01:45.396
All right in there?

01:45.980 --> 01:48.691
Hey. Toddler. Hey.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.318
Uh, this looks, um...

01:51.444 --> 01:54.656
You know, there's a woman in there
who's obsessed with me...

01:54.739 --> 01:56.991
- Oh, this one, too?
- Yep. Yeah, yeah.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.870
Oh, actually, I have a question for you.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.080
- Okay.
- I'll come out.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.082
Oh. Okay.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.544
Do you remember when I called you
about my brother Buster?

02:08.627 --> 02:10.755
The missing person thing. Did he show up?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.715
- Did anybody claim him?
- They got him.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.718
- They did. I had a feeling.
- Yeah.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.762
Well, I'm going home.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.389
Okay. Great.

02:20.431 --> 02:21.391
I live here.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.727
Oh. Didn't know they paid you that fair.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.479
Yeah, good for you.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.276
That is one dirty cop.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.443

<i>But diplomacy won the day.</i>

02:51.963 --> 02:55.383
Yeah, I'm just... I'm making sure
that she knows that we broke up.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.719
I could run that up for you.
Save you a trip.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.596
Okay. Yeah.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.514
Make sure she doesn't think
<i>you're </i> trying to break up.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.224
Nah.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.435
You reconsidered the scuba trip?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.812
Oh, God, it's tempting as hell, but I...

03:07.896 --> 03:09.480
- You're in love.
- So in love.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.274
Maybe next time?

03:11.816 --> 03:13.026
Promise?

03:13.109 --> 03:14.068
I do.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.280
Ciao.

03:18.031 --> 03:18.865
I'll see ya.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.911
<i>But moments after leaving</i>
<i>his father's gift</i>

03:22.994 --> 03:24.537
<i>- outside Rebel's door...</i>
- George!

03:25.663 --> 03:27.790
Hey! Oh!

03:28.333 --> 03:29.876
What are you doing here?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.628
Uh, uh, you mean without calling?

03:31.711 --> 03:34.255
I know. I'm sorry.
I was shooting this tiny movie

03:34.339 --> 03:37.258
in Mexico for two months,
and, uh, I meant to call you.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.178
And I just landed.
How did you find out I was back?

03:40.261 --> 03:42.680
Thought I'd get lucky.
Well, you'd get lucky.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.557
I'm sure that strikes you
as inconsiderate... I got it.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.893
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, he's my hero.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.229
Well, I hope he's not expecting a tip.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.981
- They instruct us not to ask.
- I don't have any cash.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.776
<i>George Michael decided</i>
<i>to split the difference.</i>

03:54.859 --> 03:57.237
Just take it. Jerk. Kidding.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.072
Sorry. Thank you. Beat it.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.033
- Nice guy. Tough job.
- What?

04:03.326 --> 04:04.869
Tough guy. Thinks he's a tough guy.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.621
But he does a nice job.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.708
As do these sex toys
I caddishly brought you.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.585
Wait.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.880
What is <i>this </i> used for?

04:16.714 --> 04:17.966
That is a device

04:18.048 --> 04:20.468
that older people use
to put their shoes on...

04:20.551 --> 04:22.303
<i>...without bending over!</i>

04:22.428 --> 04:25.265
<i>Get Shoedini right this second.</i>

04:25.348 --> 04:26.266
<i>Come on, please!</i>

04:26.349 --> 04:28.518
<i>It's not just a shoehorn.</i>

04:28.601 --> 04:30.895
<i>It's a shoehorn on a stick!</i>

04:30.979 --> 04:34.065
From TV?
Well, I can think of another use for it.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.734
But I've gotta be gone in five minutes.
I've gotta pick up my son.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.153
It's gonna be a quickie,
and then we can get out of here.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.448
<i>Which was the line George Michael</i>
<i>had planned to use,</i>

04:42.532 --> 04:43.616
<i>so he improvised.</i>

04:43.700 --> 04:47.328
Fine, but I hope we can spend
some quality time together later.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.748
Oh, my God, you're the dream boyfriend.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.166
Well...

04:53.084 --> 04:55.295
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

04:55.378 --> 04:57.422
<i>who lost everything, and the one son</i>

04:57.505 --> 05:00.300
<i>who had no choice
but to keep them all together.</i>

05:06.222 --> 05:07.932
<i>It's...</i>

05:11.561 --> 05:14.939
<i>Having just handed</i>
<i>his son a breakup cactus,</i>

05:15.023 --> 05:16.607
<i>Michael boarded the boat</i>

05:16.691 --> 05:20.278
<i>for his three-month sojourn
to stare at the ocean floor.</i>

05:21.779 --> 05:23.656
<i>But not without some regret.</i>

05:24.490 --> 05:26.868
<i>While up the wharf,
the other Bluths prepared</i>

05:26.951 --> 05:29.620
<i>to graciously receive
the Family of the Year award</i>

05:29.704 --> 05:31.664
<i>they were generously giving themselves</i>

05:31.748 --> 05:33.291
<i>at the banana stand,</i>

05:33.374 --> 05:34.625
<i>only to discover...</i>

05:34.709 --> 05:36.836
- There's no banana stand.
- What happened?

05:36.919 --> 05:38.254
Who was the advance?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.382
Who was the advance team?
You're the campaign manager.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.802
- This could ruin your mother's campaign.
- I can't take credit for this.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.387
<i>Because she had a plan.</i>

05:46.471 --> 05:48.598
Why don't you write a speech
for her to say about you?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.475
When my mom's giving the speech,

05:50.558 --> 05:53.227
we'll be in the background,
and we're going at it.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.812
And then, I open my mouth,

05:54.896 --> 05:57.482
and I have these rotted-out meth teeth,
and I'm like,

05:57.565 --> 06:00.068
"Why do I gotta my cousin
for meth money, Mom?"

06:00.151 --> 06:01.569
Yeah, we're circling it.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.280
- Um, I'll get into it.
- Oh, my God.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.992
Hi, this is Maeby Fünke,
for the Lindsay Bluth campaign.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.703
Where are my meth teeth?
It's been over two hours.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.832
Nobody's seen the stand since Cinco.
Kids probably threw it in the water...

06:14.916 --> 06:18.002
- <i>Which was bad news for Tobias...</i>
- You can't have

06:18.086 --> 06:22.048
a family-friendly banana stand award
without a man dressed... What?

06:22.131 --> 06:25.468
<i>...who had finally found a way
to slip into the family.</i>

06:25.551 --> 06:27.512
I'm out. I know.

06:28.137 --> 06:29.222
I get it.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.184
I feel like a moron.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.270
All right. We're set up.
Paid the crew $75 an hour. Let's go.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.397
- Let's go.
- Wait.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.524
Lindsay's not here. Why are we starting?

06:39.607 --> 06:40.608
It's okay. I'll go.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.527
I got something for Dad, anyway.

06:42.610 --> 06:45.696
This is <i>O.C. Can You Say by the Sea.</i>

06:45.780 --> 06:46.864
We're bringing you

06:46.948 --> 06:49.700
the first annual Family of the...

06:49.784 --> 06:52.203
Of the Year!

06:53.913 --> 06:57.625
Let's hear it for the... of the Year!

07:03.089 --> 07:05.633
I thought there was gonna be music or...

07:05.716 --> 07:07.969
Thank you, Beard, for...

07:10.972 --> 07:11.848
"Dad...

07:14.225 --> 07:17.854
You were always there for me.
You were always there for me.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.897
And, man, we've had fun together.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.191
How about that Mexico trip?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.446
Things we'll remember:

07:27.155 --> 07:28.322
'always horny' shirts...

07:29.740 --> 07:31.159
eating chips in the car...

07:32.076 --> 07:33.327
'Shut up, G.O.B.!'

07:35.121 --> 07:37.790
And almost making love
to some roadside bushes.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.293
'Shh. Don't tell Mom!'"

07:40.793 --> 07:42.086
What?

07:44.422 --> 07:48.426
"Remember how our Winnebago
got demolished by that train?

07:49.260 --> 07:50.928
So many memories.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.307
That's why all you have to do
is look at me, and you'll realize

07:54.849 --> 07:57.560
that you've done something great
in this life.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.982
You are the golden anchor of this family,

08:03.566 --> 08:07.361
the man who not only left his mark
on Newport

08:07.695 --> 08:10.823
with the great banana... stand...

08:11.574 --> 08:14.160
up. Good habit. Standing is... Yep.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.371
You always leave your mark
everywhere you sit.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.707
So I give you

08:19.999 --> 08:22.877
the biggest anchor of gold in the world.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.506
I only wish it were real gold
so that you wouldn't have 30 years

08:26.589 --> 08:28.174
of hard work ahead of you."

08:29.300 --> 08:31.135
Thirty years!

08:31.219 --> 08:33.095
<i>What a horrible speech.</i>

08:33.179 --> 08:34.514
Oh, my gosh.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.517
Uh, thank you.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.933
I, uh...

08:39.894 --> 08:42.980
Oh, wow, it's heavy. I haven't...
This, uh, well...

08:43.063 --> 08:45.191
Let 'em try to take this away from me,
huh?

08:45.274 --> 08:47.860
They'll have to pry it
out of your cold, dead hands.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.322
<i>And soon, Lindsay arrived</i>

08:51.405 --> 08:53.533
<i>in what was her second outfit of the day.</i>

08:53.616 --> 08:55.618
Oh, you're not wearing that.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.788
You're running to fill a House seat,
not a sofa.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.415
I'm starting to worry
you're not even capable

09:01.499 --> 09:03.626
of saying something nice
about me in your speech.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.379
Lindsay, saying nice things
about you is easy.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.755
Oh, Mom.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.757
The hard part is not sounding sarcastic.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.467
Oh, now, seriously, go change.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.928
That outfit shouldn't even come
in that size.

09:14.011 --> 09:15.304
How about this, Mom?

09:17.098 --> 09:19.475
Nothing to criticize now. Happy?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.311
Come on,
let me hear one of your crinkly smiles.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.897
At least it fits.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.234
- Look who grew out of her sheet.
- I thought about it.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.945
It's a big day.
I'm being honored. I should look my best.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.655
Well, let me know when you do.

09:33.447 --> 09:36.075
And you just won yourself
a sheet-covered daughter.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.911
Take that off.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.580
The cameras are getting this.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.499
You don't like anything
under this. Why should I take it off?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.042
You don't have a speech for me.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.669
You're going to be surprised

09:46.752 --> 09:48.838
when I get up there.

09:50.798 --> 09:54.594
Know what your number one tool is
for a scuba diver?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.139
Your sun. All right?
You gotta see how the sun

09:58.222 --> 10:01.100
is coming through the ocean,
'cause that's gonna be your guiding light.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.769
<i>And as Michael</i>
<i>faced his biggest fear,</i>

10:03.853 --> 10:04.937
<i>leaving behind his son...</i>

10:05.021 --> 10:07.273
I gotta go back. You can't leave.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.108
- Turn this around.
- Too late.

10:09.191 --> 10:12.028
- Double dock fees. Got a tight schedule.
- <i>...his son showed up,</i>

10:12.111 --> 10:14.780
<i>willing to face a big fear himself.</i>

10:15.781 --> 10:17.074
Hey! Hey!

10:17.158 --> 10:19.201
What are you doing?
I was coming back to you.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.911
What? No, I just...

10:20.995 --> 10:23.414
I don't want to leave things
emotionally ambiguous

10:23.497 --> 10:25.333
- or unresolved!
- I don't want to leave

10:25.416 --> 10:27.460
without having some sense of the...

10:27.543 --> 10:30.296
- ...value of this relationship!
- What?

10:30.379 --> 10:33.257
<i>The farther away they got,</i>
<i>the more they realized</i>

10:33.341 --> 10:35.259
<i>they did have to say to each other.</i>

10:35.926 --> 10:37.345
- What?
- Stay there.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.846
I'm coming back. We're coming back.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.624
<i>And without the ability to speak,</i>

11:06.707 --> 11:09.752
<i>they resorted to a language
they'd learned long ago.</i>

11:15.633 --> 11:18.427
<i>Which was all</i>
<i>that needed to be said,</i>

11:18.511 --> 11:20.179
<i>but the moment was short-lived.</i>

11:51.335 --> 11:54.338
You do this!
You always try to save everyone.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.674
I'm literally saving you. Come on.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.427
Turn over on your back, like an otter.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.471
- Were you trying to kill yourself?
- No.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.349
I dropped my prize,
and I was trying to find it.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.851
I would've been fine.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.103
Maybe I was trying to save you.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.063
Want to save me?
Stop playing games with me.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.357
Stop trying to teach me a lesson
by hiding Buster.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.484
I talked to a cop. I know someone got him.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.654
Got him?
Michael, we don't have Buster.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.948
We would never make you worry.
We love you.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.409
That's why we got rid
of your $700,000 debt.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.829
Hang on. What are you talking about?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.122
I thought that was Lucille 2.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.249
- You forgave the debt?
- Of course we did.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.544
I mean, well, no, technically,
we forgot the debt.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.130
We can forget it,
but we can never forgive it.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.840
- We need the write-off.
- Why'd you think

12:37.923 --> 12:39.467
they were trying to teach you a lesson?

12:39.925 --> 12:42.344
Because I was teaching them a lesson.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.721
- Huh?
- He knows.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.598
I declared Buster missing,

12:45.681 --> 12:49.351
and then they were gonna try
to teach me a lesson, right?

12:49.435 --> 12:51.937
By having the fake Buster
over at Lucille 2's today

12:52.021 --> 12:54.523
when I walked in,
so that I would still think

12:54.607 --> 12:56.275
that Buster was still missing.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.111
How did they know
you were gonna walk in today?

13:00.404 --> 13:01.238
What's that?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.574
It was a last-minute trip.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.785
You just came down to get your scuba gear.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.703
<i>It wasn't a half bad point.</i>

13:07.787 --> 13:09.413
Well, I gotta find a phone.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.626
<i>And back at the ceremony,</i>
<i>Lucille had taken the podium</i>

13:13.709 --> 13:16.545
<i>to deliver a speech her daughter thought</i>

13:16.629 --> 13:19.089
<i>- she had failed to write.</i>
- "As grateful as I am

13:19.465 --> 13:21.467
to be with my family today,

13:21.550 --> 13:25.095
I want to make special mention
of my only daughter,

13:25.179 --> 13:27.389
who thinks I didn't write a speech.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.310
This young woman has had
to show enormous strength,

13:31.811 --> 13:35.231
and not just to endure
having me as a mother.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.401
But she's the one we honor today,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.571
a woman I should have honored long ago,

13:42.655 --> 13:46.242
because I've got a daughter
who has many faces,

13:46.325 --> 13:48.160
and all of them are beautiful.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.787
She stole my speech.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.332
Maybe you can show the world
the smile I love so much.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.793
That doesn't make sense
without meth teeth!

13:55.876 --> 13:57.962
<i>But it made sense to Lindsay.</i>

13:58.045 --> 14:01.257
I've been wanting to hear that.
I didn't think I would.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.343
- Well, now you have.
- God, it was my dream.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.346
What a waste of a dream.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.642
It's nothing.
I can see that now.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.187
I think I'm gonna go now.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.439
Find out who my real family is.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.734
<i>And though her mother</i>
<i>had stolen a speech from Maeby...</i>

14:20.818 --> 14:22.069
Find my real mother.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.114
<i>- ...Lindsay stole a line from Michael.</i>
- I'm out of here.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.034
<i>Maeby had planned on</i>
<i>humiliating her mother,</i>

14:29.118 --> 14:31.787
<i>but her mother was leaving,
and she wanted to give her</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:35.291
<i>one last kiss goodbye,
before the cameras left.</i>

14:36.876 --> 14:39.295
<i>But George Michael
had learned a thing or two,</i>

14:39.378 --> 14:42.256
<i>and he learned
both those things in Spain.</i>

14:42.381 --> 14:44.508
- Hmm.
- That takes the fun out of it.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.678
Maybe we should kiss again
to teach them a lesson. Yeah?

14:48.345 --> 14:49.263
Okay,

14:50.347 --> 14:52.516
you're presenting awards
on a crime scene, and that is,

14:52.600 --> 14:54.059
of course, against the law.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.519
What the hell is going on?!

14:55.603 --> 14:57.688
Why?
Because the banana stand is gone?

14:57.771 --> 15:00.608
No, because of
the bloody trail that led to it.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.109
Ah, I've said too much.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.987
Where the hell did you run off to?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.780
Michael tried to kill himself.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
I got there in time to save him,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.159
- but he doesn't have Buster.
- What?

15:10.242 --> 15:13.996
<i>Which was good news for Tobias,</i>
<i>who was already in his backup costume.</i>

15:14.079 --> 15:17.333
And my name is Buster Bluth,
and, yes, I am a monster.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.627
Buster? Isn't he supposed to be in jail?

15:19.710 --> 15:22.463
Well, that's not exactly
what I was going for, but sure.

15:22.546 --> 15:25.799
Oh! But they're buying it, see?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.802
Um, hey, uh,
I just found out that they're, uh,

15:28.886 --> 15:29.845
holding Buster in jail.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.472
- Buster's in jail?
- Why?

15:31.555 --> 15:35.351
He walked into the police station,
and they're holding him for something.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.436
Why would Buster go to the police?

15:37.519 --> 15:39.730
The truth, Mom? I told him to.

15:39.813 --> 15:43.025
But I wanted to make it clear
that I'm never coming back again.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.198
<i>And that's when Michael decided</i>
<i>to try out a new line.</i>

15:49.823 --> 15:50.908
Okay, I will stay.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.331
<i>The Bluths were waiting</i>
<i>for news about Buster,</i>

15:57.414 --> 15:59.792
<i>whom they'd just discovered
had been in jail.</i>

15:59.875 --> 16:01.919
Buster's been trapped here for months.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.046
<i>His mother was worried.</i>

16:04.713 --> 16:06.131
God knows what he's told them.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.800
Like we don't have enough on our plate

16:07.883 --> 16:10.219
with Lindsay running off
before the election.

16:10.302 --> 16:14.223
I left word for Barry. The guy
in his office thinks bail's gonna be 50.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.308
Well, you're paying for it, not us.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.477
That would wipe me out, Mom.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.812
This is your fault.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.981
You lied to us about
Buster being missing

16:22.064 --> 16:23.565
to teach us a lesson.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.111
Because you lied to Buster
that I agreed to look after him.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.237
I didn't lie.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.781
I saw you that night at the pier
and asked you to.

16:35.077 --> 16:39.081
For the last time, I was not there.
Or, if I was there, I have no memory.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.418
Okay. Does it matter
who remembers what, Michael?

16:42.501 --> 16:43.502
Just forget that.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.129
Bluth?

16:45.212 --> 16:46.463
Yes.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.631
Only one of you.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.882
Okay.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.263
- What?
- You're the one he's gonna want to see.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.515
He didn't want to see me
last time I talked to him.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.852
He said he was all grown up
and found a new mother.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.603
God.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.146
What a baby thing to say.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.401
I think this is a job
for the man in charge...

17:08.318 --> 17:09.694
of the president, so, Dad.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.366
Okay. I'll go in,

17:14.450 --> 17:18.871
but I don't think it's gonna help
if I go in and take a swing at a guard.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.207
Uh, maybe I stab one of them.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.919
No, the only way you're stabbing
anything is if you have a knife.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.881
That's what he meant.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.885
- That's what I meant.
- Okay. I'm gonna go in.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.345
It's getting rough out here. Guard?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.347
So, Mom wouldn't come in, huh?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.349
How'd you know she was here?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.101
I can smell her on you.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.854
Ah. Right. I forgot, you're good at that.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.773
I remember that time
she changed her perfume

17:45.856 --> 17:47.149
and she lost you at the park.

17:47.232 --> 17:50.319
Yeah. That never happened.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.864
It was at Nordstrom's, and Mother
was ambushed by the Charlie girl.

17:53.947 --> 17:57.034
Yes. And we found you
in the break room with the Chanel man.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.078
He should never have lost his job
for that.

18:00.079 --> 18:00.954
What happened?

18:01.288 --> 18:02.915
He was just giving me a Fanta!

18:02.998 --> 18:06.168
I know I should've spoken up
for him, but I was only a boy.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.004
- Barely out of my teens. I didn't...
- Currently.

18:09.088 --> 18:13.425
I'm wondering what happened here.
You were supposed to lay low, remember?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.719
Go to the station, say you're not missing.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.597
That's what I did.
I was supposed to be mother bait,

18:18.680 --> 18:20.766
but mother never came to pick me up.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.017
Mm-hmm.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.852
Did she even know I was missing?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.897
No. You were no longer missing
after you got arrested.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.818
Did you tell them that you found Lucille 2
passed out on the stair car?

18:30.901 --> 18:31.985
I said "dead."

18:33.070 --> 18:35.364
Maybe they said "dead,"
and I said, "I wish."

18:36.198 --> 18:37.324
Why'd you do that?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.159
I thought it was funny.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.745
Oh, by the way,
I also told <i>you </i> that I saw her

18:41.829 --> 18:43.205
on the stair car, Michael.

18:43.288 --> 18:47.042
- I thought you were trying to be funny.
- You have a weird sense of humor.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.043
<i>Weeks earlier...</i>

18:48.127 --> 18:50.420
Tell me why she's there one minute
and gone the next.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.297
<i>...the cops had no sense of humor.</i>

18:52.381 --> 18:53.841
Maybe she crawled away.

18:53.924 --> 18:57.052
She was always falling down
or crawling away

18:57.136 --> 18:59.388
or rolling off-camera and stuff.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.891
I don't know why it's a crime
to not know where someone is.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.726
No. It's... This part is the crime.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.478
<i>Having seen he was</i>
<i>caught on camera,</i>

19:06.562 --> 19:09.523
<i>Buster had tried to erase
the security tape.</i>

19:09.982 --> 19:11.441
<i>Unfortunately, to do so,</i>

19:11.525 --> 19:14.486
<i>he used his nephew's software, Fakeblock,</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:17.656
<i>which was fake,
so it couldn't block anything.</i>

19:17.739 --> 19:20.075
<i>- But it was easy to dance to.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

19:21.493 --> 19:24.037
That's because if you saw the first video,

19:24.121 --> 19:26.748
you'd think,
"Why didn't that guy just erase this?"

19:26.832 --> 19:29.793
Some might consider that
tampering with evidence.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.754
- Thanks. You can go.
- Thank you.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.591
You had me come
all the way down here

19:35.674 --> 19:37.467
so I could play a video off our Dropbox?

19:37.551 --> 19:41.054
Oh. "Okay, evidence guy,
we're done with you."

19:41.597 --> 19:42.598
Well, it's your job.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.391
Putting it on Dropbox is my job.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.602
Walking a mile to my parking spot

19:46.685 --> 19:49.188
'cause you can't admit
you don't know how to use Dropbox!

19:49.271 --> 19:51.023
That's not even his job.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.233
He's as much of a detective as someone

19:53.317 --> 19:55.319
- with "detective" in their title.
- I don't care about

19:55.402 --> 19:56.778
- the evidence guy.
- Join the club.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.280
Why were you trying to erase a tape?

19:58.363 --> 19:59.406
I panicked.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.910
I had had a fight with Lucille 2
because she made me miss Mom's trial,

20:02.993 --> 20:05.704
and I guess somebody saw us fighting,
and if anything happened to her,

20:05.787 --> 20:08.498
you know they love to blame it
on the crazy vet.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.043
Oh. I'm trying to do air quotes,

20:11.126 --> 20:12.961
but they metal-strapped my hand
because people were using it

20:13.045 --> 20:14.671
to make tattoos when I was asleep.

20:14.755 --> 20:18.467
- What's going on with the other?
- This is so I don't take the strap off.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.719
Got it. Okay, I got a call into Barry.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.721
He's gonna get you out, and I'm sure

20:22.804 --> 20:25.432
nothing you've said is admissible,
unless you've...

20:25.515 --> 20:27.559
Waived my rights to an attorney? I did.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.812
- What for?
- What for? You told me to.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.942
Plus, I didn't want the evidence guy
to have walked all that way for nothing.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.322
<i>Michael had just left the prison</i>

20:40.405 --> 20:42.032
<i>- when his attorney called.</i>
<i>- I'm here.</i>

20:42.115 --> 20:44.409
At the prison? You're at the prison?

20:44.493 --> 20:47.537
Yeah. And I'm not making a lot of friends,
either.

20:47.621 --> 20:51.083
The guards hate me, 'cause what is
a defense attorney doing here?

20:51.166 --> 20:52.376
And the inmates hate me,

20:52.459 --> 20:55.420
'cause what is a defense attorney doing
in the shower?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.297
What are you doing in there, Barry?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.591
Legally, it's the only place
they can't record you

20:59.675 --> 21:00.717
when you talk to inmates.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.804
- <i>I don't think that's true.</i>
- Really?

21:03.887 --> 21:07.599
<i>- I got the worst </i> <i>clients.</i>
- Look, have you seen Buster?

21:07.683 --> 21:10.394
<i>No, my hands are tied till you post bail.</i>

21:10.477 --> 21:12.813
I think the clerk said it was $50,000.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.941
<i>Call Raphael at Atomic Bonds,
tell him it's for Barry.</i>

21:16.024 --> 21:20.028
We can talk next steps with Buster
at your place tomorrow in person.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.699
<i>- I prefer things face-to-face.</i>
- Less chance of a misunderstanding.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.827
<i>Okay, I'll do it.
I'll get the bail. I'll cover it.</i>

21:26.910 --> 21:30.247
I just, I hope that our position
has not been greatly weakened.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.165
Of course we're gonna have
a great weekend.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.542
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

21:33.625 --> 21:36.503
<i>And so, the next day,</i>
<i>the family gathered</i>

21:36.586 --> 21:39.673
<i>under a banner they'd been repurposing
for a party</i>

21:39.756 --> 21:42.259
<i>customized to Buster's limited palate.</i>

21:46.888 --> 21:50.600
Uh, yeah, I guess I'll take
a hamburger with two tops.

21:51.018 --> 21:54.604
Michael said Barry would be here
with Buster over an hour ago.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.774
Maybe Buster made him stop
to make sure nobody found the body.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.651
Lucille 2's fine.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.987
Believe me,
she's somewhere with a new chin,

22:02.070 --> 22:03.947
sipping steak through a straw.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.742
You know,
if Buster was a murderer,

22:06.825 --> 22:08.243
your mother would be in danger.

22:08.327 --> 22:12.331
Maybe I should move into the cottage
with you two.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.709
That way, one of us can always be awake.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.753
As your therapist, I encourage you

22:17.836 --> 22:21.131
to let go of relationships
that don't serve you.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.091
You're no longer my therapist.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.177
Okay. We're making progress.

22:25.260 --> 22:29.056
Then, as your roommate,
I encourage you to claim your space.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.475
You're no longer my roommate.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.187
You are just progressing
by leaps and bounds.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.439
A victim of my own competence.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.025
And this goes for your... hold this...

22:41.318 --> 22:42.861
"acting partner," too.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.530
Oh, he's more than my acting partner.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.824
Much more. He's my, uh...

22:48.700 --> 22:49.993
Boyfriend.

22:50.077 --> 22:53.038
They think, they think
that we're boyfriends, Dad.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.457
Well, thanks for giving away
that surprise!

22:55.540 --> 22:58.126
I'm his bastard father.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.004
This is my bastard son, Murphybrown.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.256
Murphy? And his last name is Brown?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.008
No. Murphybrown is his first name.

23:05.092 --> 23:09.596
His last name is... uh...
Well, now it's Fünke.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.765
- Oh, that's how you say it.
- Yes.

23:11.848 --> 23:14.601
He's named after a famous
private investigator who worked

23:14.684 --> 23:18.605
for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>
and then for <i>The Washington Post.</i>

23:18.688 --> 23:21.274
I believe it is a character from TV

23:21.358 --> 23:23.193
that was played by Candice Bergen.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.361
Mm.

23:25.612 --> 23:28.365
Well, that is a coincidence.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.410
Uh, now I have two things
to be embarrassed about,

23:31.493 --> 23:34.454
the second being keeping this a secret
for so long, and...

23:34.538 --> 23:37.874
I feel like I should apologize
to maybe...

23:39.626 --> 23:41.545
half the people in this room,

23:41.628 --> 23:43.672
but maybe most of all...

23:44.714 --> 23:47.300
Mother Bluth, because bringing my son

23:47.384 --> 23:50.554
back into our family
clearly drove Lindsay away.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.222
Wait, Mom left?

23:52.806 --> 23:54.433
Then why am I wearing this?

23:54.516 --> 23:58.520
Oh, uh, before I forget,
this is your half-sister, Maeby.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.313
Close one! I think

24:00.397 --> 24:02.482
she's rather very hot.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.693
She okay?

24:04.776 --> 24:06.027
Oh, she'll be fine.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.988
I was here for her entire childhood.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.032
Let's put a nugget in your mouth.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.076
You're being sweet to me.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.787
He's here. He's here!

24:15.871 --> 24:18.665
- Should we hide? Everybody, hide.
- He's innocent, coward.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.003
Oh, God, Barry. Barry.

24:23.086 --> 24:26.298
You guys, you guys, you are the best!

24:26.381 --> 24:28.341
- This is so wonderful.
- Barry?

24:28.425 --> 24:29.885
- Yeah?
- Where's Buster?

24:30.427 --> 24:32.220
In jail.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.974
Is this your cover
just to throw me this party?

24:37.058 --> 24:39.352
- Thank you.
- Barry, what's... hang on.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.606
What's going on? I talked to you.
I told you Buster was in jail.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.608
You said you were, too,
and that if I could get bail

24:44.691 --> 24:46.401
to your guy...

24:46.485 --> 24:48.862
...then we can talk next steps with Buster

24:48.945 --> 24:50.906
<i>at your place tomorrow in person.</i>

24:51.656 --> 24:52.491
Thanks.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.744
So, you're saying
I paid to bail you out?

24:55.911 --> 24:57.662
You weren't gonna leave me there,
were you?

24:57.746 --> 24:59.664
I did not know you were <i>in </i> jail.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.750
That's why I like to do things
face-to-face, okay?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.543
- Understood.
- Oh-ho-ho!

25:03.627 --> 25:05.128
Michael, you did it!

25:05.212 --> 25:07.005
You didn't know that Barry was in jail?

25:07.088 --> 25:10.467
God, this is so...
This is hysterical. This is priceless.

25:10.550 --> 25:11.676
One for the ages, Dad.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.930
No, this is never gonna get
out of my system.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.685
- You okay?
- What made you think Buster was in jail?

25:20.769 --> 25:23.855
- You thought that he was gonna kill you.
- True.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.526
G.O.B., Buster <i>is </i> in jail.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.654
Oh. Right.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.489
We were just there.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.076
Michael made an honest mistake.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.413
Geez, I hope Buster doesn't kill us
for laughing.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.212
<i>With danger lurking,</i>
<i>the Bluth family tightens their ranks.</i>

25:47.295 --> 25:48.922
- This doesn't leave this house!
- All right.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.424
All right. It's fine.
The boy can be trusted.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.094
Are we absolutely sure about that?

25:54.844 --> 25:56.972
Why don't we let the boy
speak for himself?

25:58.473 --> 25:59.558
Am I the boy?

25:59.641 --> 26:02.894
- I've never heard a man ask that question.
- Nor have I.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.938
You know
what would be a good idea?

26:05.021 --> 26:07.691
Why don't you get me a Fanta
on your way out of the family.

26:07.774 --> 26:08.775
It's in the fridge.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.611
I don't know what's happening.
