WEBVTT

00:10.833 --> 00:12.326
How do you eat that crap?

00:12.350 --> 00:13.642
Easy, like this.

00:16.488 --> 00:19.366
Our anonymous caller was supposed to
meet us here three hours ago, boss.

00:19.390 --> 00:20.528
I say we call it.

00:20.552 --> 00:22.019
I would love to but,

00:22.347 --> 00:25.389
he claims he has information on a
terrorist attack, so here we sit.

00:25.479 --> 00:26.540
Like the guy last Saturday

00:26.564 --> 00:28.751
claimed his dog was
a Taliban sympathizer?

00:28.775 --> 00:31.298
Why are we pulling this crap duty
two weekends in a row anyway, boss?

00:31.322 --> 00:33.321
You know I'm wondering
the same thing, Jim.

00:33.362 --> 00:36.213
I... Hold on. Hold on.
Stand by. This is him.

00:37.469 --> 00:38.915
We're here. Where are you?

00:39.082 --> 00:41.905
Close. Meet me at 408 Millstone Avenue.

00:42.071 --> 00:43.494
I'll explain all inside.

00:43.698 --> 00:45.577
I prefer the meeting on the street.

00:45.601 --> 00:46.601
I do not.

00:46.942 --> 00:48.977
I'm a dead man if they
see me talking to you.

00:49.001 --> 00:49.978
Who?

00:50.002 --> 00:51.448
The people no one can see.

00:51.472 --> 00:52.583
They are everywhere.

00:54.310 --> 00:56.701
Invisible folks. This should be fun.

00:56.896 --> 00:58.022
Find him, guys.

00:59.414 --> 01:00.525
I think we just did.

01:01.674 --> 01:02.773
Yeah, I got him.

01:05.985 --> 01:07.814
The sunglasses are a nice touch.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.476
How do you want us to handle this?

01:10.518 --> 01:12.312
Pick him up. I'll be right behind you.

01:12.336 --> 01:13.538
You got it.

02:24.872 --> 02:28.237
Secret is to keep your front
shoulder in as long as possible.

02:28.988 --> 02:31.922
Both eyes stay level on the pitcher,

02:32.489 --> 02:34.547
weight is back and you track the ball.

02:36.479 --> 02:37.588
And you wait.

02:43.838 --> 02:45.507
It's all about concentration.

02:46.118 --> 02:48.969
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a cute butt?

02:52.695 --> 02:54.956
I'm sorry. Did I just ruin
your concentration, Jethro?

02:54.980 --> 02:56.693
No, it was a lousy pitch.

02:56.717 --> 02:57.874
It happens.

02:57.898 --> 03:00.221
But you still haven't
answered my question.

03:00.944 --> 03:03.461
Do you want me to teach
you how to hit or not?

03:03.488 --> 03:06.350
Well, considering my CO
just placed me in charge

03:06.374 --> 03:08.211
of our softball team, yeah.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.288
By all means, teach away.

03:11.150 --> 03:12.587
This end here, it goes up.

03:12.611 --> 03:14.061
I think I got that part.

03:14.085 --> 03:15.478
All right.

03:15.502 --> 03:17.797
Inside of your feet,
shoulder width apart.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.421
Slightly bend the knees.

03:20.811 --> 03:22.091
Hands together,

03:22.550 --> 03:24.274
knuckles lined up.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.707
You teach everyone this way?

03:28.070 --> 03:29.109
Yeah.

03:30.847 --> 03:32.066
Fast or slow?

03:32.090 --> 03:34.161
Kind of depends on what mood I'm in.

03:34.185 --> 03:36.159
Okay, fast it is.

03:44.856 --> 03:46.099
You got to swing to hit it.

03:46.123 --> 03:48.230
I knew I was forgetting something.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.369
This thing go any faster?

04:04.070 --> 04:05.047
Yeah. Gibbs.

04:05.071 --> 04:07.369
Boss, a bomb took out
two of Cassidy's people.

04:07.393 --> 04:08.606
Yeah, I'll be right there.

04:08.630 --> 04:09.714
I got to go, Hol.

04:11.032 --> 04:13.386
What happened to our spending
an entire weekend together?

04:13.410 --> 04:15.606
I just lost two NCIS agents.

04:18.387 --> 04:19.463
Did you know them, McGee?

04:19.487 --> 04:21.392
Jim Nelson and I went to FTC together.

04:21.416 --> 04:22.894
I was at his wedding two months ago.

04:22.918 --> 04:24.619
This better not be another recall drill.

04:24.643 --> 04:26.880
I had floor seats for the
Wizards this afternoon.

04:26.904 --> 04:29.321
It's Agent Cassidy's team
out of the Pentagon, Tony.

04:29.345 --> 04:30.377
They were attacked.

04:30.401 --> 04:31.445
She okay?

04:31.469 --> 04:32.469
She survived.

04:32.780 --> 04:34.090
Her men weren't as lucky.

04:34.114 --> 04:35.230
Well, what the hell happened?

04:35.254 --> 04:36.945
That's what we're
gonna find out, DiNozzo.

04:36.969 --> 04:38.143
Grab your gear.

04:39.594 --> 04:41.036
Grab your gear!

04:53.865 --> 04:56.855
Flags of Iran, Iraq,
Syria and Saudi Arabia.

04:57.842 --> 04:59.350
What type of a store was this?

04:59.374 --> 05:01.059
McGee's working on it, Ziva.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.123
Their deaths were almost immediate

05:03.147 --> 05:04.792
if that's any consolation, Jethro.

05:04.816 --> 05:06.219
No, it's not, Ducky.

05:06.708 --> 05:07.994
No, it never is.

05:08.372 --> 05:11.560
All our agents' wounds appear
to have been caused by shrapnel,

05:11.584 --> 05:13.003
specifically

05:13.448 --> 05:16.312
ball bearings and nails,

05:16.336 --> 05:18.515
the hallmark of a homemade device.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.547
All emanating from a
central point of the floor.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.069
Now, this man appears
to literally have been

05:25.093 --> 05:27.127
at the heart of the explosion.

05:27.151 --> 05:28.462
He was sitting on the bomb?

05:28.486 --> 05:30.173
He was the bomb, DiNozzo.

05:33.585 --> 05:34.700
Electrical wiring.

05:34.825 --> 05:39.245
Yeah. Explosive amputation of legs, arms

05:39.607 --> 05:40.641
and head.

05:40.665 --> 05:41.711
A suicide bomber.

05:43.065 --> 05:45.197
I don't suppose any of
you have seen the head?

05:45.221 --> 05:46.873
Still looking for it, Ducky.

05:46.897 --> 05:48.874
Judging by the holes in the ceiling,

05:48.898 --> 05:50.857
we may have to try the roof next.

05:51.088 --> 05:53.151
Why blow yourself up in an empty store?

05:53.175 --> 05:55.046
It wasn't empty, Tony!

06:00.844 --> 06:03.708
He insisted on being
part of the investigation.

06:03.806 --> 06:05.093
Talked to the landlord.

06:05.117 --> 06:07.570
Said he just rented the
place to a nonprofit group.

06:07.594 --> 06:09.929
He's pulling the
paperwork. Calling him now.

06:11.389 --> 06:13.031
It's my fault! It's my fault.

06:13.055 --> 06:14.588
It's not your fault, Paula.

06:14.612 --> 06:16.349
You weren't here, Tony!

06:16.908 --> 06:18.735
I've killed my team! Outside.

06:18.759 --> 06:20.151
Take it outside.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.096
DiNozzo, find me that missing head.

06:26.349 --> 06:28.008
Well, it's a drop ceiling,

06:28.032 --> 06:30.507
so the thing's probably
wedged up there somewhere.

06:30.622 --> 06:33.389
Ziva, you're going head-hunting.

06:43.051 --> 06:45.936
I don't need a lecture right
now, Gibbs. I really don't.

06:49.214 --> 06:50.758
I'm just bringing you this.

06:52.774 --> 06:53.901
Thanks.

06:55.277 --> 06:57.567
Tell me about the phone call
at tip-line this morning.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.370
Anonymous, just a guy saying he had
info on a potential terrorist attack.

07:01.394 --> 07:02.733
Did he name the target?

07:02.757 --> 07:05.091
No, but it was obvious it's us.

07:06.201 --> 07:08.069
I should have gone in with those guys!

07:08.093 --> 07:10.530
Well, yeah, then you'd be
dead, too. It was an ambush.

07:10.554 --> 07:12.507
There was nothing you could have done.

07:12.531 --> 07:15.007
Would you feel the same
way if it was your own team?

07:15.031 --> 07:16.031
Yes, I would.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.391
I have a tough time
believing that, Gibbs.

07:21.415 --> 07:23.519
Yeah, well, the difference,
Paula, is I wouldn't stop

07:23.543 --> 07:27.157
to grieve until I put the bastards
responsible for this in the ground.

07:28.344 --> 07:29.344
What about you?

07:34.262 --> 07:35.528
You knew him.

07:37.535 --> 07:39.109
He was a good friend of mine.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.195
Seeing him like this...

07:42.419 --> 07:43.628
it's almost like...

07:44.159 --> 07:45.798
It could have been you.

07:47.105 --> 07:48.565
It almost was, McGee.

07:48.971 --> 07:52.224
We were supposed to work
the hotline this weekend.

07:52.911 --> 07:54.449
Boss, you serious about that?

07:54.473 --> 07:55.789
What happened here?!

07:55.813 --> 07:57.425
Hang on! Hey!

07:57.647 --> 07:58.640
Who are you?

07:58.664 --> 07:59.777
We work here.

07:59.801 --> 08:02.293
For the Muslim Coalition For Peace.

08:08.546 --> 08:11.006
Yazeed, was he. Was he in here?

08:11.577 --> 08:13.737
We're supposed to help
him paint this afternoon.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.248
I found it!

08:21.585 --> 08:23.226
Allah, Yihfidhna!

08:23.977 --> 08:25.103
You recognize him?

08:25.451 --> 08:26.660
Yazeed Fahad,

08:27.425 --> 08:29.344
our chapter president.

08:30.821 --> 08:33.375
Whatever happened to Gibbs' rule
about not putting two suspects

08:33.399 --> 08:34.890
in the same room?

08:34.914 --> 08:36.150
More of a guideline.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.423
You are not listening
to me, Agent Gibbs.

08:38.447 --> 08:40.508
Yazeed Fahad was a man of peace!

08:40.532 --> 08:43.655
He condemned suicide bombers
as cowards, agents of evil.

08:44.018 --> 08:46.015
And now you wish us to
believe that he was one?

08:46.039 --> 08:47.096
He was wearing the bomb.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.849
Then he was forced to put it on.

08:48.873 --> 08:49.957
By who?

08:51.204 --> 08:52.975
The timing was not a coincidence.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.768
Yazeed organized a meeting with both.

08:54.792 --> 08:57.272
Shiites and the religious
leaders for this Friday.

08:57.296 --> 09:00.479
Clerics and holy men from five different
Arab countries will be in attendance.

09:00.503 --> 09:03.953
All of them prepared to issue fatwas
condemning the sectarian violence in Iraq.

09:03.977 --> 09:07.193
Their words could save
thousands of lives.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.855
How many will attend if they
find the man who planned it

09:11.879 --> 09:12.958
was a suicide bomber?

09:13.339 --> 09:14.830
Where were you this afternoon

09:14.854 --> 09:16.524
when your president
was blowing himself up?

09:16.548 --> 09:18.827
Lunch, together.

09:19.105 --> 09:20.106
Where?

09:22.854 --> 09:24.769
We don't have to answer these questions.

09:24.793 --> 09:25.904
We're not criminals.

09:26.011 --> 09:28.017
Well, I think you should
both get a good lawyer.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.258
- But we did nothing...
- The Grace Street Diner.

09:30.995 --> 09:33.108
We were there between 1:00 and 2:30.

09:33.979 --> 09:36.034
They're only doing their jobs, Abdul.

09:37.224 --> 09:40.047
When they do, they'll see
that Yazeed was innocent.

09:41.886 --> 09:42.934
I'm going to go with you.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.324
Gibbs wants you here, Paula.

09:44.348 --> 09:45.608
Why?

09:46.166 --> 09:47.166
Ask him.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.111
I cannot give you my name.

09:53.319 --> 09:54.797
Sir, we have standard procedures.

09:54.821 --> 09:56.118
If you want to stop this attack,

09:56.142 --> 09:57.954
you will have an agent meet me.

10:03.659 --> 10:05.704
McGee? Is that you?

10:07.982 --> 10:10.037
How long have you been sitting there?

10:10.733 --> 10:11.733
Not long.

10:11.955 --> 10:15.195
I'm really sorry about Jim Nelson.

10:15.668 --> 10:17.558
I know you guys were really close.

10:20.604 --> 10:23.734
I wouldn't have graduated
from FLETC without his help.

10:24.577 --> 10:26.343
Then we would have never met.

10:27.121 --> 10:28.957
Then maybe he'd still be alive.

10:29.721 --> 10:32.161
We were supposed to
take the weekend shift.

10:32.185 --> 10:34.291
Those bodies downstairs should be us.

10:35.544 --> 10:36.798
Timothy...

10:37.435 --> 10:39.887
don't even think things like that, okay?

10:39.911 --> 10:41.996
Everything happens for a reason.

10:45.491 --> 10:47.115
I'm not even going to ask.

10:47.535 --> 10:50.483
Um, technically, that
was a squatting hug.

10:50.830 --> 10:52.416
Or a... "squg,"

10:52.673 --> 10:54.454
if you will, but I digress.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.168
Yeah, big-time.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.558
I have some paperwork to do.

11:00.998 --> 11:02.162
What have we got?

11:02.186 --> 11:04.999
I analysed and compared
the two tip-line calls

11:05.023 --> 11:08.436
and the one this morning that
Agent Cassidy got on site.

11:09.123 --> 11:12.228
Same caller both times, and
I'm assuming that it's this guy,

11:12.252 --> 11:13.948
Yazeed Fahad.

11:14.390 --> 11:17.352
Can you tell us something
that we don't know, Abby?

11:19.354 --> 11:20.678
Okay, how about this?

11:20.702 --> 11:22.079
He was in the Navy.

11:22.103 --> 11:25.208
And he was honorably discharged in 2004.

11:25.232 --> 11:27.210
The suicide bomber was a sailor.

11:27.234 --> 11:31.187
I wouldn't be too quick to rush
to judgment on that, Agent Cassidy.

11:31.211 --> 11:32.630
Jethro, could you come down here?

11:32.654 --> 11:35.420
There's something you really must see.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.118
It appears we have a bit of a mystery.

11:38.142 --> 11:41.645
I'm not entirely certain
how our guest died.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.498
Well, it's kind of obvious, Duck.

11:43.522 --> 11:47.666
Yes, if I base the results
solely on the damage to his body.

11:47.690 --> 11:50.867
Fortunately, we have this
miraculously preserved head.

11:50.891 --> 11:54.601
And the rate of decay of his brain
tissue doesn't even come close

11:54.625 --> 11:56.339
to the time of the explosion.

11:56.363 --> 11:58.717
I saw that guy walk
through the door, Ducky.

11:58.741 --> 12:01.952
Well, Agent Cassidy, I don't
see how that's possible.

12:02.202 --> 12:04.685
Our suicide bomber was dead

12:04.709 --> 12:08.388
at least one day before
his bomb went off.

12:18.986 --> 12:19.986
You okay?

12:20.536 --> 12:22.610
I just got off the phone with Amy,

12:22.929 --> 12:26.239
Special Agent James
Nelson's bride of two months.

12:27.559 --> 12:28.570
Correction,

12:29.446 --> 12:30.438
widow.

12:30.462 --> 12:32.440
Now I have to call Tom and Mary Hall.

12:32.464 --> 12:34.373
I don't like making these calls, Jethro.

12:34.397 --> 12:35.841
No C.O. does, Jen.

12:35.865 --> 12:36.987
I know, but...

12:38.105 --> 12:41.582
- What?
- This isn't Iraq or Afghanistan.

12:41.791 --> 12:45.420
My people are not supposed to be
killed by suicide bombers here.

12:45.525 --> 12:48.005
No, but they were, Director,

12:48.029 --> 12:50.403
and it'll happen again
if you stand around here

12:50.427 --> 12:51.742
feeling sorry for yourself.

12:51.766 --> 12:53.903
I am not feeling sorry
for myself, Jethro.

12:53.927 --> 12:57.010
I'm feeling sorry for the
agents and their families.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.197
But you're right.

13:02.867 --> 13:04.217
I have a call to make

13:04.241 --> 13:06.185
and you have a terrorist to kill...

13:08.365 --> 13:09.498
catch.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.523
By the way, Ducky says

13:14.031 --> 13:17.318
the bomber was dead at least a
day before he blew himself up.

13:17.990 --> 13:20.310
You might want to
give that some thought.

13:22.215 --> 13:23.754
We swabbed his apartment,

13:23.778 --> 13:26.530
not a trace of explosives;
He was a former sailor,

13:26.554 --> 13:29.186
president of the Muslim
Society For Promoting Peace.

13:29.210 --> 13:31.967
Tony checked out his
friends. Their alibi holds up.

13:31.991 --> 13:34.868
- They were at a restaurant...
- Are you going to make a point soon?

13:38.136 --> 13:39.332
Yes.

13:39.492 --> 13:41.862
Who did you see entering the
building yesterday, Cassidy?

13:41.914 --> 13:43.768
I'm not convinced that
it wasn't this guy.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.909
I mean, how do we know
Ducky didn't make a mistake?

13:45.933 --> 13:48.436
- Tony?
- 'Cause Ducky doesn't make mistakes.

13:48.678 --> 13:51.444
Which means what you saw yesterday
was, by definition, mistaken.

13:51.468 --> 13:53.754
Look, even if he did die the day before,

13:53.778 --> 13:56.430
it doesn't mean he
wasn't involved, right?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.316
She does have a valid point, Ziva.

13:59.340 --> 14:01.156
We don't even know what
his cause of death is.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.582
For all we know, he could
have committed suicide.

14:03.606 --> 14:06.711
A suicide bomber who commits
suicide before his bombing?

14:06.735 --> 14:09.964
- I mean, that doesn't make any sense!
- No, it doesn't.

14:09.988 --> 14:11.953
But it does raise an interesting point.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.677
Imagine if you will, ladies,

14:13.701 --> 14:17.793
an assisted suicide of a suicide bomber
who suicided before his suicide bombing.

14:17.817 --> 14:19.638
It's kind of like how many
chucks would a woodchuck chuck

14:19.662 --> 14:20.670
if a woodchuck could chuck...

14:20.694 --> 14:23.158
DiNozzo, what the
hell is wrong with you?

14:23.182 --> 14:26.672
I am just trying to lighten the
mood of the room a little bit, boss.

14:26.696 --> 14:28.305
I got a better way: Leave.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.805
And take her with you.

14:29.829 --> 14:30.848
That works for me.

14:30.872 --> 14:32.280
That works for me too, David.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.351
"Dar-veed."

14:33.375 --> 14:35.906
Reevaluate the crime scene. Do
not come back until you figure out

14:35.930 --> 14:39.308
how the guy she saw got
out before the explosion.

14:39.614 --> 14:42.082
Are you getting soft on
me, Officer "Dar-veed"?

14:42.106 --> 14:44.096
Look, I know what she's going through.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.619
Sometimes you need to find something
or someone to focus your anger on.

14:48.001 --> 14:49.030
It's your only relief.

14:49.807 --> 14:51.807
Of course the drawback is, you know,

14:52.325 --> 14:54.897
that they tend to hate you for life.

14:57.414 --> 14:59.639
If it helps her get through it,

15:00.417 --> 15:02.072
I can live with that.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.924
I don't know how you work with her.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.690
- Well, I worked with you, didn't I?
- Funny.

15:09.714 --> 15:11.661
What do you think Gibbs
would do if I slapped her?

15:11.685 --> 15:13.629
I'm more worried about whatshe'ddo.

15:14.135 --> 15:15.925
You know, Mossad assassin and all.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.872
You don't think I could take her?

15:17.896 --> 15:19.200
I took you, didn't I?

15:19.224 --> 15:22.143
Technically you did put me
down, but I distinctly remember

15:22.853 --> 15:24.452
the floor was slippery that day.

15:31.786 --> 15:33.650
Okay, I'll do the
left, you do the right.

15:33.674 --> 15:34.814
Okay.

15:35.751 --> 15:36.751
You okay?

15:38.998 --> 15:40.553
It's a little dusty in here.

15:43.597 --> 15:45.585
Paula, you don't have to do this.

15:46.850 --> 15:48.277
We both know that I do.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.444
When did you start being so caring?

15:54.206 --> 15:55.797
I have always been caring.

15:55.821 --> 15:57.601
I come from a very caring family.

15:57.625 --> 16:01.298
The DiNozzos, in fact, are
celebrated for their caringness.

16:02.154 --> 16:03.280
Right.

16:03.628 --> 16:07.605
Maybe I wasn't as
caring once as I am now.

16:07.994 --> 16:09.996
And what brought that on?

16:12.708 --> 16:14.363
Or should I say who?

16:14.905 --> 16:17.658
Well, you get older, you change.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.377
What's her name?

16:22.775 --> 16:24.532
Please tell me it's not Ziva.

16:24.556 --> 16:25.779
It's not Ziva.

16:26.441 --> 16:27.510
Good.

16:27.534 --> 16:28.934
Her name is Jeanne.

16:29.771 --> 16:30.878
You love her?

16:34.110 --> 16:35.110
Yeah, I do, Paula.

16:37.932 --> 16:39.675
Wow, you really mean that.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.122
What's the problem?

16:44.718 --> 16:45.872
I can't tell her.

16:47.054 --> 16:48.779
Why can't you tell her, Tony?

16:48.803 --> 16:51.166
It's just three simple little words:

16:51.190 --> 16:52.190
"I love you".

16:53.942 --> 16:54.997
It's not so simple.

16:56.478 --> 17:00.894
We were on this climbing wall
and she made a little bet.

17:01.589 --> 17:05.185
First one to the top
gets to say "I love you".

17:05.506 --> 17:06.818
You lost on purpose.

17:06.842 --> 17:08.359
No, I won.

17:08.384 --> 17:09.727
And you didn't say it?

17:13.098 --> 17:15.992
You know, Tony, it's a
"cliché", but it is true,

17:16.567 --> 17:20.011
life is too short to not tell
someone you love them if you do.

17:23.363 --> 17:24.502
And you do.

17:26.589 --> 17:29.345
The NCIS tip-line received
two calls on Sunday.

17:29.369 --> 17:32.108
If Yazeed didn't make
them, one wonders who did.

17:32.132 --> 17:34.328
Whoever set up Cassidy's team, Abby.

17:34.773 --> 17:36.849
Yeah, it's a rhetorical question, McGee.

17:36.873 --> 17:38.846
Just, just work with me here.

17:38.870 --> 17:41.765
The NCIS phone logs
show that both calls came

17:41.789 --> 17:43.999
from the same disposable cell phone.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.335
Are you going to tell me who, Abs?

17:47.819 --> 17:49.376
Well... no.

17:50.335 --> 17:54.973
But a third call was received by the
tip-line on Friday two days before.

17:55.396 --> 17:58.736
It's an exact voice match to
the calls that came in on Sunday.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.030
I must speak with an NCIS special agent.

18:01.054 --> 18:02.667
What is this regarding, sir?

18:02.691 --> 18:04.784
About someone I work with Yazeed.

18:04.808 --> 18:06.119
He's what, sir?

18:06.143 --> 18:08.622
I can't... I can't talk now.

18:08.646 --> 18:09.948
I'll call back.

18:10.847 --> 18:12.674
This one we can trace.

18:12.698 --> 18:16.006
It was logged from a company
n Annandale, Virginia.

18:16.344 --> 18:17.489
Kertek Computing.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.757
They make software for disabled people.

18:19.781 --> 18:21.194
That's where Yazeed works.

18:21.218 --> 18:24.106
Worked, McGee, before he
got himself all blowned up.

18:24.589 --> 18:26.818
Boss, if we can get samples
of their employees' voices,

18:26.842 --> 18:28.739
we can match it to our caller.

18:30.030 --> 18:31.307
That's good work, Abby.

18:32.688 --> 18:34.658
Not bad yourself, Elf Lord.

18:39.813 --> 18:41.029
Yazeed is dead?

18:41.301 --> 18:42.570
You're sure of this?

18:42.594 --> 18:43.571
Very.

18:43.595 --> 18:44.759
How did this happen?

18:44.783 --> 18:46.343
Cause of death is
still being determined.

18:46.367 --> 18:47.664
So you believe he was murdered.

18:47.688 --> 18:48.884
What makes you think that?

18:48.908 --> 18:52.583
Three federal agents in my office
may have something to do with it.

18:52.607 --> 18:55.336
Mr. Abu Selom, what did
Yazeed do here at your company?

18:55.360 --> 18:56.631
He was an instructor.

18:56.655 --> 19:00.394
He taught various classes on
how to best utilize our software.

19:00.418 --> 19:02.397
We're going to need to speak
to each one of your employees.

19:02.421 --> 19:06.255
As well as check out Yazeed's office
and any computers he had access to.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.776
- You have a warrant?
- I can get one soon enough.

19:10.106 --> 19:11.877
Maybe you won't need
one if you just tell me

19:11.901 --> 19:14.136
why Yazeed is dead, Agent Gibbs.

19:14.817 --> 19:16.240
You watch the news lately?

19:16.264 --> 19:18.669
Yesterday? Right around this time?

19:21.157 --> 19:23.341
The policemen that were
killed by the suicide bomb?

19:23.365 --> 19:26.891
They weren't police officers.
They were NCIS Special Agents.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.114
That's us.

19:28.138 --> 19:30.432
You see, Fahad, he was the bomber.

19:31.032 --> 19:32.032
Oh, no.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.533
No.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.501
You can talk to whoever you like.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.634
Okay, let's try this a different way.

19:54.658 --> 19:57.073
How many seconds between
our bad guy coming in here

19:57.097 --> 19:58.547
and the explosion, Paula?

19:58.900 --> 20:00.847
Maybe ten... twelve seconds.

20:01.181 --> 20:03.448
Not a lot of time for our
bad guy to get out of here

20:03.472 --> 20:05.825
before this place was turned
intoThe Killing Fields.

20:05.849 --> 20:08.107
It blew once my team closed the door.

20:08.412 --> 20:09.448
So where'd he go?

20:09.472 --> 20:11.407
There's no back door,
there's no side rooms.

20:11.431 --> 20:14.035
How does a dirtbag just
vanish into thin air?

20:20.340 --> 20:23.177
Gibbs is almost done with the
interviews. What about you?

20:23.201 --> 20:26.637
Just finishing downloading all the
folders Yazeed kept on the company servers.

20:26.661 --> 20:29.043
Any of them sound like
the voice on the tip-line?

20:29.067 --> 20:31.958
Not to my ears, but
Gibbs is recording them.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.889
Ah, they don't seem
very pleased with us.

20:34.913 --> 20:37.246
Gibbs tends to have
that effect on people.

20:38.073 --> 20:39.394
We develop the...

20:43.426 --> 20:44.707
Sorry, guys.

20:44.731 --> 20:46.737
None of these voices match our caller.

20:46.761 --> 20:48.951
Are you sure that was
every male employee?

20:48.975 --> 20:50.199
All but one, Abby.

20:50.223 --> 20:51.284
Yazeed Fahad.

20:51.308 --> 20:53.731
Who couldn't have made any calls
because he was dead at the time.

20:53.755 --> 20:55.817
We don't have a voice
sample of his anyway.

20:55.841 --> 20:56.957
Yes, we do.

20:56.981 --> 20:58.996
This is one of his training DVDs.

21:01.643 --> 21:03.497
All right, you guys
ready to give this a shot?

21:03.521 --> 21:04.832
30 minutes ago, Abs.

21:04.856 --> 21:08.278
We had to compress the DVD audio to match
the quality of the original phone calls

21:08.302 --> 21:10.044
- to make an accurate...
- Come on, McGee,

21:10.068 --> 21:11.666
will you just do it?

21:12.348 --> 21:13.413
We're doing it.

21:13.437 --> 21:14.642
Okay, Yazeed's DVD

21:14.666 --> 21:17.460
audio is on the top, and the
caller's is on the bottom.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.740
We have eight key words
from each soundtrack.

21:19.764 --> 21:22.145
But if Ducky was right about
Yazeed's time of death...

21:22.169 --> 21:24.140
This has been a whole
lot of work for nothing.

21:24.164 --> 21:25.145
Okay...

21:25.169 --> 21:26.948
And... meet... people...

21:27.416 --> 21:29.117
invisible... listen...

21:29.665 --> 21:31.205
close... suspect...

21:31.229 --> 21:32.417
back...

21:33.467 --> 21:36.141
It's an exact match.
Yazeed made the phone calls.

21:36.165 --> 21:37.601
But how is that possible?

21:37.625 --> 21:41.267
I never thought I would say
this, but Ducky was wrong.

21:41.730 --> 21:45.769
Yazeed was still alive when Cassidy's
team walked into that building.

21:52.556 --> 21:54.520
Evidence cannot tell you two completely

21:54.544 --> 21:56.332
contradictory things
at the same time, McGee.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.911
No, it can't... except when it does.

21:58.935 --> 22:00.526
It doesn't make any sense!

22:00.550 --> 22:02.437
Well, perhaps you need
a fresh pair of eyes.

22:02.461 --> 22:03.619
What do you have so far?

22:03.643 --> 22:06.275
Yazeed Fahad, a former American sailor

22:06.299 --> 22:09.057
called our tip-line to warn
of a pending terrorist attack.

22:09.081 --> 22:10.517
Yazeed set the meet here,

22:10.541 --> 22:12.477
a building with only one
way of getting in and out.

22:12.501 --> 22:15.245
Agents Hull and Nelson
followed him into the building.

22:15.269 --> 22:19.037
Both of them died seconds later when
Yazeed activated his suicide vest.

22:19.061 --> 22:21.780
According to Ducky, he
had been dead for a day.

22:22.203 --> 22:23.195
How can that be?

22:23.219 --> 22:25.646
Well, youcanblow up a dead man, McGee.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.497
True, but Abby has proof.

22:27.521 --> 22:30.222
Yazeed was talking to Cassidy
seconds before the explosion.

22:30.246 --> 22:31.844
Someone micking his voice.

22:31.868 --> 22:33.888
Audio forensics say it's an exact match.

22:33.912 --> 22:35.584
And there's no other
way out of the building?

22:35.608 --> 22:38.054
No. We covered every inch of it.

22:38.078 --> 22:40.107
He's like Shrödinger's cat;

22:40.385 --> 22:42.318
Alive and dead at the same time.

22:44.295 --> 22:46.129
Existing in a super position.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.332
It's quantum physics... theory.

22:49.356 --> 22:53.304
When faced with a situation like
this, the solution's obvious.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.115
One of them's wrong.

22:55.139 --> 22:58.129
I was going to use the
term "mistaken", but yes.

22:58.153 --> 23:00.343
So we have to choose
between Abby and Ducky?

23:00.367 --> 23:02.137
I'd rather be McGee's cat.

23:02.161 --> 23:04.297
So which one are you leaning toward?

23:04.982 --> 23:06.372
Neither.

23:07.331 --> 23:09.306
My money's on DiNozzo.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.482
I let you down.

23:19.650 --> 23:22.097
I give you my word, I'm
gonna get this bastard.

23:22.612 --> 23:24.075
Who are you talking to?

23:25.375 --> 23:26.988
No one, me.

23:29.299 --> 23:30.299
I got the goodies:

23:32.364 --> 23:34.564
Cigar, paper towel,

23:34.588 --> 23:36.937
water and a candy bar.

23:37.570 --> 23:38.742
That one's for you.

23:38.978 --> 23:40.772
Can I have the cigar?

23:41.509 --> 23:42.682
Well, I need it.

23:42.706 --> 23:45.149
If there is a secret passageway in here,

23:45.695 --> 23:46.687
I'm finding it.

23:46.711 --> 23:48.545
How are you gonna do that?

23:51.173 --> 23:53.588
I saw it in this old monster movie.

23:54.243 --> 23:55.243
This guy...

23:56.216 --> 23:58.650
is trying to find his girlfriend

23:58.956 --> 24:01.403
in some evil scientist's castle.

24:07.562 --> 24:11.039
Now don't move... too much or talk.

24:11.063 --> 24:13.573
And if there are any
gaps in these walls,

24:13.597 --> 24:16.340
then the air pressure should
suck some smoke through 'em.

24:16.364 --> 24:18.450
DiNozzo, we checked this wall.

24:18.474 --> 24:19.771
It's solid brick.

24:19.795 --> 24:21.899
You ever hear of a secret passageway?

24:21.923 --> 24:24.527
No, this wall shares with
the building next to it.

24:24.551 --> 24:26.321
How could there be a passageway?

24:26.345 --> 24:29.513
Okay, Paula, a secret door, then.

24:29.537 --> 24:33.109
All right, we're running out of
daylight. I'm gonna be in the car.

24:37.832 --> 24:39.324
Special Agent Cassidy...

24:40.808 --> 24:42.351
check this out.

24:49.130 --> 24:51.889
I'm gonna go get a
pry bar from the trunk.

24:55.374 --> 24:57.098
I can't believe that.

24:58.349 --> 24:59.556
Believe that.

25:11.849 --> 25:14.023
All right, DiNozzo,
it's time to get serious.

25:14.047 --> 25:16.098
You're messing with a buckeye.

25:16.313 --> 25:18.223
You want it, I'll bring it.

25:18.247 --> 25:19.494
I'm from Ohio.

25:19.668 --> 25:21.031
One, two.

25:27.496 --> 25:29.375
I thought I'd just
check it from this side.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.674
This thing is cool.

25:31.915 --> 25:33.199
Are you okay?

25:33.223 --> 25:36.715
It's a old college football injury.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.980
That do close kind of fast, don't it?

25:53.004 --> 25:54.565
It wouldn't be much of a secret door

25:54.589 --> 25:56.802
if it stayed open long now, would it?

25:57.035 --> 25:58.121
Tony, look.

25:59.744 --> 26:02.377
The guy that I saw was wearing
mirrored shades this shape.

26:02.401 --> 26:05.696
He probably dropped them
hauling ass from the explosion.

26:06.936 --> 26:08.769
Congratulations, you did see him.

26:10.465 --> 26:11.777
Means you're not crazy.

26:11.801 --> 26:13.121
Not yet at least.

26:15.165 --> 26:17.424
Ah, Mr. Palmer, did you manage...?

26:17.448 --> 26:18.948
You want to see us, Duck?

26:20.874 --> 26:23.503
Did you pass Mr. Palmer
on your way down here?

26:23.527 --> 26:25.256
- No.
- I swear, every time

26:25.280 --> 26:28.820
I turn my back these days that
young man is running off somewhere.

26:28.844 --> 26:31.033
Well, you should try smacking
him in the back of the head.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.870
- It did wonders for DiNozzo and McGee.
- Well, I did.

26:33.894 --> 26:36.231
Mr. Palmer seemed to enjoy it.

26:37.232 --> 26:38.460
I'll remember that.

26:38.484 --> 26:41.909
I apologize for the delay in
determining the exact cause

26:41.933 --> 26:43.642
of Yazeed's death, but the bomb

26:43.959 --> 26:45.852
didn't leave us much to work with.

26:45.876 --> 26:49.359
Thankfully, his brain
survived relatively unscathed.

26:49.383 --> 26:53.836
My first clue was the massive
accumulation of lactic acid in its cells.

26:53.860 --> 26:56.471
This normally occurs
when the brain is forced

26:56.495 --> 26:59.798
to obtain energy by
anaerobic glycolysis.

26:59.822 --> 27:01.346
Yeah, naturally, Duck.

27:01.939 --> 27:06.389
I had a series of CAT scans
done to confirm my suspicions.

27:06.413 --> 27:09.837
These dark areas show
the most brain damage,

27:09.861 --> 27:12.846
all areas associated with rapid

27:13.305 --> 27:14.977
and sudden loss of oxygen.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.675
- He was suffocated.
- Yes.

27:16.699 --> 27:18.230
You have enough left to tell me how?

27:18.254 --> 27:19.505
Oh, yes.

27:19.714 --> 27:23.101
Yazeed was suffocated with
a silicone-based substance

27:23.125 --> 27:28.185
that was forced into his mouth and
nose, allowed to harden and then removed.

27:28.209 --> 27:32.342
Whoever did it was probably
trying to make a mask of his face.

27:32.366 --> 27:35.062
Abby says it's latex.

27:35.086 --> 27:37.162
Abby also says you're wrong.

27:37.186 --> 27:40.624
So I've heard. Only I'm afraid
it's the other way around.

27:40.648 --> 27:44.502
This man was dead long
before his bomb went off.

27:46.066 --> 27:47.819
I'd stake my career on it.

27:51.810 --> 27:54.665
- You guys miss me today, Abs?
- Why, where were you?

27:55.880 --> 27:57.029
Never mind.

27:57.053 --> 27:58.665
Of course I did, Tony.

28:00.236 --> 28:01.766
Sorry. Are you okay?

28:01.998 --> 28:03.472
Cassidy hit me.

28:03.722 --> 28:06.406
If I'd punched him, Abby,
he wouldn't be standing.

28:07.296 --> 28:10.675
Never lie to a woman, Anthony DiNozzo.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.755
What do we got, McGeekle?

28:13.779 --> 28:15.270
Well, Ducky is still saying that.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.955
Yazeed was dead when the bomb went
off, and Abby is saying he was alive.

28:18.979 --> 28:21.342
- What did Gibbs say?
- Where the hell you been, DiNozzo?

28:21.366 --> 28:23.372
Solving the mystery of the
vanishing dirtbag, boss.

28:23.396 --> 28:24.921
Yeah, well, it took you long enough.

28:24.945 --> 28:27.663
He... found a secret passageway
into the store next to it.

28:27.687 --> 28:30.315
It was actually quite impressive.

28:30.339 --> 28:32.234
Turns out both places were part of a

28:32.258 --> 28:34.887
magic joke shop that closed
down about 20 years ago.

28:34.911 --> 28:36.069
So I was right.

28:36.401 --> 28:37.977
You didn't see Yazeed
enter the building.

28:38.001 --> 28:39.585
Thank you for pointing that out...

28:40.461 --> 28:41.990
- Officer David.
- "Daa-veed"!

28:42.894 --> 28:46.013
But now we know we're looking
for another man, and...

28:46.037 --> 28:49.309
we're hoping, praying that
you can pull a print off that.

28:49.333 --> 28:51.785
If there is a print,
if there is a fiber,

28:52.286 --> 28:55.485
if there is a drop of
dried sweat I will find it.

28:56.819 --> 28:57.918
Not bad.

28:59.878 --> 29:01.741
Hey, boss...

29:02.345 --> 29:04.236
I got a question for you.

29:05.055 --> 29:06.793
That thing you said yesterday

29:08.138 --> 29:11.211
we were really supposed to have the
weekend duty Cassidy's team took?

29:11.892 --> 29:14.076
- Yep.
- How'd we get out of that?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.217
I asked.

29:19.101 --> 29:20.454
So that really could have been us?

29:20.478 --> 29:23.596
It could have been us every
single damn day of the week.

29:23.620 --> 29:24.794
Sometimes it has been.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.744
You want to worry about
something? Worry about tomorrow.

29:39.060 --> 29:41.020
Going off to war, Gunny?

29:41.511 --> 29:42.749
You trying to get rid of me.

29:42.773 --> 29:44.528
I haven't decided yet.

29:44.552 --> 29:47.316
Well, while you're thinking about it,

29:47.340 --> 29:49.851
why don't we pound
down some of that chow?

29:50.282 --> 29:52.117
Spoken like a true Marine.

29:52.966 --> 29:54.611
I heard what happened.

29:55.478 --> 29:56.575
Anything I can do?

29:57.953 --> 29:59.512
Yeah, chopsticks?

30:02.097 --> 30:03.446
Anything else?

30:04.169 --> 30:05.236
Soy sauce.

30:08.012 --> 30:09.989
You're not gonna talk about it, are you?

30:10.013 --> 30:11.036
Nope.

30:11.745 --> 30:12.801
Got it.

30:28.727 --> 30:31.402
I had a very good time
at the batting cage.

30:32.324 --> 30:34.359
Yep. It was fun.

30:34.826 --> 30:36.659
We should do that again sometime.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.670
Yeah, we should.

30:39.694 --> 30:42.167
Too bad our schedules
are polar opposite.

30:43.212 --> 30:45.715
Must be a CID/NCIS thing.

30:46.806 --> 30:49.634
Well, someone's got to keep
the wolf away from the door.

30:49.658 --> 30:51.432
That's why I've been thinking.

30:51.701 --> 30:53.999
Coming up on my
20-year mark next month.

30:54.023 --> 30:55.424
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

30:56.299 --> 30:58.612
You're right in the zone
for full-bird colonel.

30:58.636 --> 31:00.702
I'm thinking about retiring, Jethro.

31:03.571 --> 31:08.142
Settling down, you know, making
some time for the people in my life.

31:12.828 --> 31:14.058
So what do you think?

31:17.918 --> 31:19.804
- Where's Gibbs?
- We found him.

31:19.828 --> 31:21.330
- Who?
- That dirtbag who took

31:21.354 --> 31:22.930
my team into that slaughterhouse.

31:22.954 --> 31:25.845
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs! We got
a fingerprint match off the piece

31:25.869 --> 31:28.451
of mirrored sunglass lens
that Cassidy and Tony found.

31:28.475 --> 31:31.622
Salman Umar we interviewed him
yesterday at Kertek Computing.

31:31.646 --> 31:34.931
I got two fulls, a right
index and a forefinger

31:34.955 --> 31:36.495
and I got a partial on the left thumb.

31:36.519 --> 31:39.494
I also found his home address
and a couple of his uncles

31:39.518 --> 31:41.193
that lived in...

31:42.709 --> 31:44.085
Be safe.

31:47.293 --> 31:49.120
Low and slow, McGee.

31:49.144 --> 31:51.345
Take the rear exit and don't spook him.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.679
We take him alive.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.863
Find out if he's working
with anybody else.

31:54.887 --> 31:56.595
I don't get an answer from you, Cassidy,

31:56.619 --> 31:58.430
I'll take your weapon
from you right now.

31:58.454 --> 32:01.123
Alive. Alive, I got it. I got it.

32:02.249 --> 32:04.979
Well, Special Agent Gibbs, has
there been some development?

32:05.003 --> 32:07.293
Need to ask your employees
a few more questions.

32:07.317 --> 32:10.014
You already cost me a
full day's work yesterday.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.440
Oh, damn it.

32:15.464 --> 32:17.345
NCIS! Everybody get down!

32:17.369 --> 32:19.083
On the floor! Now!

32:44.993 --> 32:46.055
We had no choice, Gibbs.

32:46.079 --> 32:48.474
If we had not acted, he
would have shot someone.

32:48.498 --> 32:51.767
We had a choice. I could
have left her back at NCIS.

32:52.771 --> 32:53.777
He was carrying this.

32:53.801 --> 32:55.195
I want to know why.

32:55.219 --> 32:56.513
Yeah.

32:59.891 --> 33:01.254
It's Arabic. Read it.

33:03.047 --> 33:06.243
"A covenant from Mecca sponsored
by the Muslim Coalition for Peace".

33:06.267 --> 33:08.579
The flyer for the conference on Friday.

33:08.656 --> 33:10.202
You think he was planning on attending?

33:10.226 --> 33:12.504
I doubt that, Officer "Daa-vid".

33:12.528 --> 33:16.119
Umar was quite vocal about
his feelings toward Shiites.

33:16.143 --> 33:19.828
He used to argue quite a bit with
Yazeed on how they were destroying Iraq.

33:19.852 --> 33:22.568
Well, it would have been nice
to have known that yesterday.

33:22.592 --> 33:25.183
People have a right to their
own opinions, Agent Gibbs.

33:25.207 --> 33:28.484
His were usually ignorant and
colored by his own prejudice.

33:28.517 --> 33:32.134
- Still, I can't believe that he would...
- That he would kill over them?

33:33.980 --> 33:36.066
Apple, toast...

33:36.269 --> 33:37.713
Boss, you should see this.

33:37.774 --> 33:42.015
Pig, giraffe, Yankee, white.

33:42.655 --> 33:44.968
Is it me or does this sound
like Yazeed Fahad's voice?

33:44.992 --> 33:46.025
Turn it up.

33:46.049 --> 33:49.721
Holland, black, display,

33:50.333 --> 33:52.849
results, orientated.

33:52.873 --> 33:55.247
What the hell kind of
program is that, McGee?

33:55.271 --> 33:57.753
V.S. Twelve. It's still in development.

33:57.777 --> 33:59.455
It's a vocal simulation.

33:59.479 --> 34:03.748
It allows disabled people who can't talk
to converse in a natural sounding voice.

34:03.772 --> 34:05.119
Just like Stephen Hawking,

34:05.143 --> 34:06.808
you type and the
computer says the words.

34:06.832 --> 34:09.755
Yes, but ours uses a 3D
model of the vocal chords

34:09.779 --> 34:13.339
to resonate cavities in the
head creating a lifelike sound.

34:13.362 --> 34:15.253
Umar was our main programmer.

34:15.643 --> 34:17.052
Would explain how Yazeed

34:17.076 --> 34:18.915
was making phone calls
from the dead, right?

34:18.938 --> 34:20.904
But I don't see how
he could have done it.

34:20.928 --> 34:24.518
It would have required a CAT
scan of Yazeed's throat and mouth.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.933
For a terrorist whack job,
Omar is an amazing programmer.

34:27.956 --> 34:29.563
Amazing enough to fool me.

34:29.587 --> 34:32.702
This recreates Yazeed's
voice flawlessly.

34:34.079 --> 34:35.909
Now you know why you
found traces of latex

34:35.933 --> 34:37.750
in my throat and mouth, Abby.

34:37.774 --> 34:39.879
Well, yes, I do, Yazeed.

34:40.964 --> 34:42.438
What about you, Tony?

34:42.659 --> 34:44.135
And I like your shirt, by the way.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.478
It's sexy.

34:46.466 --> 34:48.760
Thanks, it's from the George
Peppard Collection, I'm...

34:49.399 --> 34:50.399
Abby.

34:50.568 --> 34:52.222
Sorry. Sorry.

34:52.375 --> 34:54.813
Umar didn't need a CAT scan for Yazeed.

34:54.837 --> 34:57.848
He poured hot latex down
his throat and cast a mold.

34:59.716 --> 35:02.169
All he had to do was
laser-scan it into his computer,

35:02.193 --> 35:03.770
input the results into the program.

35:03.794 --> 35:04.826
Mystery solved.

35:04.850 --> 35:07.802
Umar was who you heard
type-talking on the phone, Paula.

35:07.826 --> 35:11.072
The guy that I saw was not
carrying a laptop and typing.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.437
I would have definitely noticed that.

35:13.461 --> 35:15.252
Means he wasn't working alone.

35:16.526 --> 35:17.518
Hey, Gibbs.

35:17.542 --> 35:18.589
Why no Caf-POW?

35:22.074 --> 35:23.437
I'll shut up now.

35:24.182 --> 35:26.376
Your team was set up, but
they weren't the target.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.509
Yazeed was.

35:27.533 --> 35:29.876
They were trying to stop his
Sunni-Shia peace conference.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.877
By turning him into a suicide bomber?

35:31.901 --> 35:33.211
It almost worked, Paula.

35:33.235 --> 35:37.060
But luckily for us, Yazeed
lost his head, literally.

35:37.084 --> 35:38.659
We don't know that it didn't work.

35:38.683 --> 35:40.530
At this point, who's going
to show up to this thing?

35:40.554 --> 35:42.285
You'd be surprised, Cassidy.

35:42.309 --> 35:44.660
We're not the only ones who
refuse to bow down to terrorism.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.426
They're going ahead with
the conference anyway?

35:46.450 --> 35:47.878
Now that we've cleared Yazeed.

35:47.902 --> 35:49.565
But we only got one of them.

35:49.589 --> 35:51.127
What if somebody else tries to stop it?

35:51.151 --> 35:52.532
We kill them, Abby.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.089
We catch them.

35:54.422 --> 35:56.890
- That's the preferred term.
- I like hers better.

36:00.797 --> 36:02.719
If there are still any holdouts,

36:02.743 --> 36:05.875
I will personally call
and offer reassurances

36:05.899 --> 36:08.816
that Yazeed Fahad was
the victim of a terrorist

36:08.840 --> 36:10.547
bombing and not the perpetrator.

36:10.571 --> 36:14.151
I'm sure a reassurance from you will
encourage people to attend, Director.

36:14.175 --> 36:16.756
This incident has only
strengthened our resolve.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.317
And made your peace
conference a major target.

36:19.341 --> 36:21.717
All the more reason for us
not to back down, Agent Gibbs.

36:21.741 --> 36:23.504
That's why we're going to help.

36:23.528 --> 36:26.516
I have contacted the
FBI and Metro Police,

36:26.540 --> 36:29.141
and they've agreed to increase
security at your conference.

36:29.165 --> 36:32.687
I will also be assigning
agents for close protection

36:32.711 --> 36:35.381
of the senior clerics that
will be attending the event.

36:35.405 --> 36:37.465
- Bodyguards?
- Where they go, we go.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.693
Yazeed always spoke highly
of his time in your Navy.

36:41.717 --> 36:44.070
- Now I can see why.
- We are in your debt.

36:44.094 --> 36:48.165
If your event lessens or
ends the insurgency in Iraq,

36:48.189 --> 36:50.695
it is us who are in
your debt, gentlemen.

36:53.466 --> 36:55.521
Thank you for your support, Director.

36:55.905 --> 36:56.905
Thank you.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.882
Sheik Abu Talid Yusef,

37:00.906 --> 37:02.820
the senior Sunni cleric in attendance.

37:02.844 --> 37:04.432
He's yours for the day, Tony.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.631
Sheik Ali Bashir, the senior
Shia cleric is Cassidy's,

37:07.655 --> 37:12.572
and the most senior cleric at the
conference is Imam Abdul Al-Maliki.

37:12.596 --> 37:13.596
He's mine.

37:13.968 --> 37:15.611
Ziva floats between all three,

37:15.635 --> 37:17.016
depending on the situation.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.936
The quickest way to stop the conference
is to target one of these men.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.384
Well, we're not gonna let that happen.

37:21.408 --> 37:22.637
Boss, what about me?

37:23.408 --> 37:25.477
Yeah, right. Almost forgot.

37:25.501 --> 37:28.313
Names of everyone
attending: Run them down.

37:28.337 --> 37:30.636
Look for any links to terrorist groups.

37:31.147 --> 37:33.150
There looks to be over
300 names here, and

37:33.174 --> 37:34.694
the conference starts
in less than six hours.

37:34.718 --> 37:37.220
Yeah. Why you still
standing there, McGee?

37:37.874 --> 37:38.851
Right.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.924
We pick them up at their
hotels one hour before?

37:40.948 --> 37:43.408
No. A little change of plans.

37:43.658 --> 37:44.873
We pick them up now.

37:44.897 --> 37:46.250
A little field trip.

37:46.274 --> 37:49.725
They want to hold a ceremony
for Yazeed and Cassidy's team.

37:49.749 --> 37:51.447
What kind of ceremony?

37:51.471 --> 37:52.693
- A memorial.
- Where?

37:54.400 --> 37:55.429
Where they died.

38:07.154 --> 38:09.407
I've never been much for praying, but...

38:09.879 --> 38:11.276
after this, I'm...

38:13.028 --> 38:14.826
Hall and Nelson were good men.

38:15.225 --> 38:16.280
They were the best.

38:19.973 --> 38:21.217
I could have saved them.

38:21.241 --> 38:23.859
Paula, that's not true.

38:23.883 --> 38:25.848
I could've turned down
the weekend duty, Tony.

38:25.872 --> 38:28.459
There's just no way we should've
had it two weeks in a row.

38:29.947 --> 38:31.548
It was supposed to be us.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.020
"Us" what?

38:34.537 --> 38:37.037
It was our team that
was supposed to take it.

38:43.787 --> 38:46.373
Oh... I mean, doesn't matter.

38:46.913 --> 38:48.042
Nothing does.

38:49.602 --> 38:51.213
I was supposed to be in here.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.538
I know it.

38:55.732 --> 38:57.099
But...

38:58.054 --> 38:59.290
here I am.

39:03.351 --> 39:04.357
Very clever.

39:04.381 --> 39:05.469
This side is clear.

39:08.241 --> 39:10.712
I didn't think anything could
make you jump, Officer "Daa-vid".

39:10.736 --> 39:12.116
That was merely a reflex.

39:12.140 --> 39:14.061
In America, we call that jumping.

39:14.085 --> 39:18.339
In Mossad, we call that the
difference between life and death.

39:25.938 --> 39:30.145
I'm just going, I'm going to let, Gibbs
know that we're... we're clear over there.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.477
Something wrong?

39:42.501 --> 39:44.433
It was supposed to be us.

39:44.767 --> 39:46.408
But it wasn't.

39:47.089 --> 39:48.187
Nope.

39:49.397 --> 39:50.665
Not this time.

39:58.607 --> 39:59.812
Abs, hey, you wanted to see me?

39:59.836 --> 40:01.853
I really need your
help with this, McGee.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.332
Gibbs has me running down the
names of over 300 people attending

40:04.356 --> 40:06.128
- a conference, I...
- Now, McGee.

40:06.851 --> 40:09.952
Okay, we know that whoever
was helping Umar was using

40:09.976 --> 40:12.409
that computer to
re-create Yazeed's voice.

40:12.770 --> 40:14.389
I know. I'm the one
who found the program.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.143
So his fingerprints could be on
this keyboard, but the problem is,

40:17.167 --> 40:18.888
so are everybody else's who ever typed

40:18.912 --> 40:20.703
on this thing, and they're all... mashed

40:20.727 --> 40:23.209
- on top of each other, look.
- So you're hand-tracing them?

40:23.233 --> 40:25.630
Well, I'm isolating the "J"
and the "F" keys because that's

40:25.654 --> 40:27.875
where you would park your fingers
when you're waiting to type.

40:27.899 --> 40:29.516
Okay, what do you need me to do?

40:29.540 --> 40:31.407
I just... I need you to look at this.

40:31.431 --> 40:33.333
I need you to check my
work because I'm getting

40:33.357 --> 40:35.146
dizzy from staring at it for so long.

40:35.170 --> 40:36.241
Okay.

40:42.533 --> 40:44.303
How long is this supposed to take, boss?

40:44.327 --> 40:46.610
Longer than if you helped
them set up, DiNozzo.

40:48.610 --> 40:51.153
When this thing starts, I
want you out front, Ziva.

40:52.002 --> 40:53.336
What about me?

40:54.699 --> 40:56.687
I didn't bring you here for security.

40:59.260 --> 41:01.518
Look, I know I screwed
up at Kertek Computers,

41:01.542 --> 41:03.229
- but I'm...
- Say a prayer

41:03.253 --> 41:04.697
for your team, Cassidy.

41:07.359 --> 41:09.636
We'll take the heavy
lifting on this one.

41:18.884 --> 41:21.127
Green one's definitely Umar.

41:21.151 --> 41:24.237
The other two are less defined.
Probably going to take a while for...

41:24.696 --> 41:25.958
You were saying, McGee?

41:25.982 --> 41:28.044
How'd you get three
potential matches so fast?

41:28.068 --> 41:31.563
Because these fingerprints were
taken from the first crime scene.

41:33.663 --> 41:37.472
Looks like it was someone who was
helping Yazeed paint the place.

41:46.513 --> 41:48.409
This was Yazeed's dream.

41:48.433 --> 41:51.658
To show the world that these
terrorist groups do not speak for us.

41:52.550 --> 41:54.605
We thank you for making it a reality.

41:56.503 --> 41:59.090
At least something good's
going to come from all of this.

41:59.486 --> 42:00.675
Yeah, Gibbs.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.585
Put your hands on top of your head.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.379
- Boss?!
- It's one of them, DiNozzo.

42:08.403 --> 42:10.395
The prints on Umar's laptop
match the painting gear.

42:10.419 --> 42:11.933
What laptop?!

42:12.184 --> 42:14.964
- Where's Jamal Malik?
- He was here a minute ago.

42:14.988 --> 42:17.544
Ziva, it's Malik! Find him!

42:17.568 --> 42:19.277
Behind you!

42:24.513 --> 42:25.612
Paula!

42:26.266 --> 42:27.987
Allahu Akkbar!

42:55.666 --> 42:58.076
Everybody hurt sometimes.

42:58.100 --> 43:01.923
Everybody cries.

43:05.395 --> 43:09.447
Everybody hurts.

43:09.471 --> 43:11.281
I love you, Jeanne.

43:11.305 --> 43:12.988
Sometimes. [Song of R.E.M.]

43:17.298 --> 43:21.720
Everybody hurts.

43:22.151 --> 43:26.176
Sometimes.

43:26.200 --> 43:34.200
So hold on...
