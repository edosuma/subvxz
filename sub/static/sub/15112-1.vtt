00:32.194 --> 00:34.197
DR. LEE: So, tell me how this works.

00:34.563 --> 00:36.198
BRITTEN: I don't know.

00:36.265 --> 00:37.366
I close my eyes.

00:37.433 --> 00:38.601
I open them.

00:38.667 --> 00:39.769
Same as you.

00:39.835 --> 00:42.004
MINISTER: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

00:42.071 --> 00:43.472
We now lay Rex Thomas...

00:43.539 --> 00:46.709
DR. LEE:  Let's just
start at the beginning.

00:46.776 --> 00:47.777
BRITTEN: No.

00:47.843 --> 00:50.980
Let's start at right now.

00:51.047 --> 00:53.682
Fair enough.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.685
I understand you've gone back to work.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.587
Mm-hmm.

00:58.654 --> 00:59.198
(thunder rumbles)

00:59.199 --> 01:00.956
DR. LEE:  And they've got
you working with a partner?

01:01.023 --> 01:03.692
VEGA:  - Detective Britten, over here.
BRITTEN: - New guy, Vega.

01:03.759 --> 01:06.862
They just want someone to hold my
hand until they know I'm okay.

01:06.929 --> 01:09.131
And are you okay?

01:09.198 --> 01:12.234
Yes.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.272
- Witnesses?
VEGA: - Yeah,

01:16.338 --> 01:18.474
I interviewed about 20,
uh, most were in the bar

01:18.541 --> 01:19.375
and came out after,

01:19.442 --> 01:21.844
but didn't actually see
the cab driver get shot.

01:21.911 --> 01:23.846
But this one guy,
Mr. Weaver,

01:23.913 --> 01:24.880
he lives right above the...

01:24.947 --> 01:26.215
Where is he?

01:26.282 --> 01:28.250
He's over there, sir.

01:30.753 --> 01:32.188
- How you doing?
- Good, thanks.

01:32.254 --> 01:33.656
I understand you saw the whole thing?

01:33.723 --> 01:35.691
Um, well, not the crime, exactly.

01:35.758 --> 01:36.859
I just heard some shots,

01:36.926 --> 01:37.960
and then I looked out,

01:38.027 --> 01:39.195
and saw some guy run away.

01:39.261 --> 01:40.496
Where did he run?

01:40.563 --> 01:41.797
It was up the block that way,

01:41.864 --> 01:45.201
and then into that alley
around the corner, but, uh...

01:45.267 --> 01:46.869
Didn't I already tell you this?

01:46.936 --> 01:47.970
Yes, in...

01:48.037 --> 01:49.071
Thanks for your help.

01:49.138 --> 01:50.106
VEGA: Thank you.

01:50.172 --> 01:52.475
Sir, as I was trying to say,

01:52.541 --> 01:54.810
the witnesses on the ground confirm...

01:54.877 --> 01:57.513
There's a camera on that
building over there.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.582
Go see if it caught anything useful.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.152
What?

02:03.219 --> 02:04.987
Well, I-I-I been meaning to thank you, sir.

02:05.054 --> 02:07.757
I been passed over for detective,
twice,

02:07.823 --> 02:09.258
before this assignment,

02:09.324 --> 02:10.793
so I'm pretty sure I'd still be in uniform

02:10.860 --> 02:12.027
if you hadn't requested me.

02:12.094 --> 02:14.663
I didn't request anyone.

02:14.730 --> 02:16.565
If you got promoted, it has
nothing to do with me.

02:16.632 --> 02:19.935
They probably didn't want to waste
anyone else's time baby-sitting me.

02:20.002 --> 02:21.370
Now, go check the camera.

02:21.437 --> 02:23.205
DR. LEE: And then what?

02:23.272 --> 02:24.907
BRITTEN: Then I go home.

02:28.241 --> 02:29.845
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

02:29.912 --> 02:31.914
You're just in time
to help me clean up.

02:31.981 --> 02:34.450
You finished downstairs already?

02:34.517 --> 02:36.085
Yeah, I did the study, too.

02:36.152 --> 02:37.286
Wow.

02:37.353 --> 02:39.055
You're quick.

02:39.121 --> 02:40.923
I'd still be on the first wall.

02:40.990 --> 02:45.061
DR. LEE:  Did she start redecorating
the house after the accident?

02:45.127 --> 02:46.862
Right after the funeral.

02:46.929 --> 02:48.330
That's a common reaction,

02:48.397 --> 02:50.599
just looking for ways to start fresh.

02:50.666 --> 02:54.537
Has she gotten to your son's room?

02:54.603 --> 02:58.340
BRITTEN:  I don't think she's
even been in there yet.

03:03.979 --> 03:06.882
DR. LEE: And then what?

03:06.949 --> 03:09.285
BRITTEN: I wake up.

03:19.628 --> 03:21.664
(door opens)

03:24.300 --> 03:26.469
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:36.212 --> 03:38.214
(horn honks outside)

03:38.280 --> 03:39.949
That's Aaron.

03:40.015 --> 03:42.118
I gotta go.

03:42.184 --> 03:43.252
(dog barking)

03:43.319 --> 03:45.321
So, uh,
what about the match?

03:45.388 --> 03:46.689
What about it?

03:46.756 --> 03:49.759
I was thinking of coming.

03:49.825 --> 03:51.360
Whatever you want.

03:56.565 --> 04:00.002
DR. EVANS: And you said
the tennis is new?

04:00.069 --> 04:02.004
Yeah, well, sort of.

04:02.071 --> 04:03.806
His mom's, uh...

04:03.873 --> 04:06.008
was a very good player.

04:06.075 --> 04:07.543
She played in college.

04:07.610 --> 04:08.644
She taught him.

04:08.711 --> 04:11.180
He used to play a lot until
he discovered football.

04:11.247 --> 04:14.383
But he's decided to
take it up again.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.719
Since your wife's funeral.

04:19.555 --> 04:21.524
Yeah.

04:21.589 --> 04:23.959
(sniffs)

04:24.026 --> 04:26.028
What's the purpose
of the rubber band?

04:27.196 --> 04:30.966
Oh, it just helps me keep things straight.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.703
Green is Rex's favorite color.

04:33.769 --> 04:37.573
I-I wear a red one when I'm with Hannah.

04:37.640 --> 04:41.077
You mean, in your dreams.

04:43.245 --> 04:44.814
Yeah.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.616
What else?

04:49.118 --> 04:51.220
(shutter clicks)

04:55.691 --> 04:57.693
Morning, Detective.

05:00.262 --> 05:02.098
- You see this coffee maker?
- Uh-huh.

05:02.164 --> 05:03.966
$600.

05:04.033 --> 05:06.001
My ex-wife, she wanted one of these.

05:06.068 --> 05:08.371
I told her she wanted a $600 coffee maker,

05:08.437 --> 05:10.039
she should not have married a police.

05:10.106 --> 05:11.907
Eventually, we agreed on that.

05:13.843 --> 05:16.746
Tell me what you see, I'll
tell you what you miss.

05:16.812 --> 05:18.948
Husband and wife victims?

05:19.014 --> 05:20.116
- Mm-hmm.
- Multiple stab wounds.

05:20.182 --> 05:22.385
Some signs they put up a fight.

05:22.451 --> 05:23.719
Also some signs that they lost.

05:23.786 --> 05:24.854
Any money?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.188
Wallet, purse?

05:26.255 --> 05:29.592
Gone, along with one of the cars, a BMW.

05:29.658 --> 05:31.394
All right, so, what am I missing, hm?

05:31.460 --> 05:33.396
Home invasion that turned messy.

05:33.462 --> 05:35.531
This is why I've avoided
success at all costs.

05:35.598 --> 05:36.899
I mean, you work your whole life

05:36.966 --> 05:38.701
to get some nice stuff just so somebody

05:38.768 --> 05:40.169
can come along and kill you for it.

05:44.073 --> 05:46.776
Calendar on the fridge says
the girl was at a practice.

05:46.842 --> 05:48.477
Hoping to track her down now.

05:48.544 --> 05:51.647
Also says the parents should
have been at a meeting.

05:51.714 --> 05:53.649
Bet they wish they'd gone.

05:57.353 --> 05:59.188
(sniffing)

05:59.255 --> 06:00.689
You smell that?

06:00.756 --> 06:02.391
Come on, you know I've had a cold

06:02.458 --> 06:03.692
since the Clinton Administration.

06:05.461 --> 06:06.929
(inhaling)

06:07.930 --> 06:09.398
(groaning): Ah...

06:09.465 --> 06:11.200
girl was here when it happened.

06:11.267 --> 06:13.102
How do you know?

06:13.169 --> 06:14.837
She hid in the closet, pissed herself,

06:14.904 --> 06:16.605
so either she ran when the killer left,

06:16.672 --> 06:17.773
or...

06:17.840 --> 06:19.008
He took her.

06:19.075 --> 06:21.744
Damn, that's what I get for hoping.

06:21.811 --> 06:24.080
People!
New deal!

06:24.146 --> 06:27.583
DR. EVANS: And this has been
happening since the accident?

06:27.650 --> 06:29.919
Yeah.

06:29.985 --> 06:32.488
That's fascinating.

06:32.555 --> 06:34.490
Uh, not to be insensitive,
it's just that...

06:34.557 --> 06:36.525
we come up with all sorts of ways

06:36.592 --> 06:39.028
to get through the loss of a loved one.

06:39.095 --> 06:40.162
Like your son

06:40.229 --> 06:41.962
taking up his mother's sport

06:41.963 --> 06:44.934
to maintain some sense
of connection with her.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.636
But your mind...

06:47.703 --> 06:50.473
it's simply created an entire reality

06:50.539 --> 06:53.142
where you haven't actually
lost your wife at all.

06:53.209 --> 06:55.911
I don't think I've ever seen a
coping mechanism quite like it.

06:55.978 --> 06:58.047
An elaborate and ongoing dream

06:58.114 --> 06:59.815
in which you haven't lost your son,

06:59.882 --> 07:03.285
relieving you of the obligation
of dealing with his death.

07:03.352 --> 07:06.155
Maybe.

07:06.222 --> 07:07.890
I'm sorry?

07:07.957 --> 07:11.394
Whether I'm with my wife or with my son...

07:11.460 --> 07:14.029
it all feels completely real to me.

07:14.096 --> 07:18.768
DR. EVANS: You mean you're
not sure which is a dream?

07:20.569 --> 07:22.505
Meaning you can't tell
whether you're awake

07:22.571 --> 07:25.041
or asleep at this very moment?

07:25.107 --> 07:26.075
Incredible.

07:26.142 --> 07:27.209
BRITTEN: Of course I'm awake.

07:27.276 --> 07:29.512
I'm awake with my wife,

07:29.578 --> 07:32.214
and I close my eyes, I open them,

07:32.281 --> 07:34.216
and I'm awake with my son.

07:34.283 --> 07:36.185
DR. EVANS:  Well, I can assure
you, Detective Britten,

07:36.252 --> 07:38.087
this is not a dream.

07:40.489 --> 07:42.291
What?

07:43.826 --> 07:46.829
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

07:50.956 --> 07:53.776
AWAKE
S01 Ep.01 - Pilot

07:58.221 --> 08:00.156
Right here;
take a look at this.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.556
Could hardly ask for a better angle.

08:05.415 --> 08:07.484
Boom.

08:07.951 --> 08:10.036
Hm, and right there,

08:10.037 --> 08:12.956
turns right to the camera.

08:13.023 --> 08:14.658
Like he meant to look at it.

08:14.724 --> 08:16.526
Why would he do that?

08:18.829 --> 08:20.397
Detectives...

08:20.463 --> 08:21.898
we've got another one.

08:21.965 --> 08:22.966
Another what?

08:23.033 --> 08:24.201
Dead cabbie.

08:24.267 --> 08:25.769
(indistinct conversation)

08:32.142 --> 08:33.677
Cab pulls up, door opens,

08:33.743 --> 08:35.111
two loud bangs, pop, pop.

08:35.178 --> 08:36.279
Everybody scatters.

08:36.346 --> 08:38.081
Driver runs up on the sidewalk

08:38.148 --> 08:40.549
while the suspect walks
right into the crowd.

08:40.616 --> 08:42.419
Skinny, cowboy hat, big sunglasses?

08:42.485 --> 08:43.687
Mm-mm.

08:43.753 --> 08:45.422
Overweight, heavy beard,
some kind of ball cap.

08:45.489 --> 08:47.324
Oh, that's wonderful.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.059
We got a killer
who does costume changes.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.862
Let me guess.

08:51.928 --> 08:53.430
He got himself caught
on camera again?

08:53.497 --> 08:55.866
Hey, Jimmy, give him the photo.

08:55.932 --> 08:58.134
JIMMY: Here you go.

08:59.703 --> 09:01.838
BIRD: Almost like he posed for it.

09:03.139 --> 09:04.105
You start taking statements;

09:04.106 --> 09:06.142
I'll see if I can find out
anything out about the driver.

09:06.209 --> 09:07.811
Yes, sir.

09:10.013 --> 09:13.083
Captain's moving me over to Western.

09:13.149 --> 09:16.253
What?
Why?

09:16.319 --> 09:17.621
Calling it a promotion,

09:17.687 --> 09:20.023
which is what they called
it when they split us up.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.125
I figure they don't want my
desk anywhere near yours.

09:22.192 --> 09:25.896
You watch yourself with him.

09:25.962 --> 09:26.976
Captain isn't moving me

09:26.977 --> 09:29.666
and getting her man to look
over your shoulder for nothing.

09:29.733 --> 09:33.837
There's nothing for him to see.
I'm fine.

09:33.904 --> 09:36.173
Which is what I told her,
and I'm being transferred.

09:36.239 --> 09:40.110
So which is the faster way for him
to get to where he wants to go?

09:40.177 --> 09:41.912
Telling the chief
what she wants to hear,

09:41.978 --> 09:45.482
or telling her that you're fine?

09:45.549 --> 09:49.186
DR. LEE:  Detective, this is a safe place.

09:49.252 --> 09:52.155
Doctor-patient confidentiality means

09:52.222 --> 09:55.158
that what you share with me
stays with me.

09:55.225 --> 09:57.861
I'm not here to judge,
I'm here to help.

09:57.928 --> 09:59.362
(scoffing): You're not here to judge?!

10:00.230 --> 10:01.464
My job depends

10:01.531 --> 10:03.533
on what you write down
on that piece of paper.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.634
You're doing your job, Detective.

10:04.701 --> 10:07.103
I don't see any reason
to change that.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.607
In fact, I see value in you
returning to a familiar routine.

10:10.674 --> 10:14.177
But the loss you suffered is enormous,

10:14.244 --> 10:16.246
and for your health,

10:16.313 --> 10:18.481
you have to process it
and deal with it,

10:18.548 --> 10:19.549
and I can help.

10:19.616 --> 10:21.651
But not if you don't let me.

10:34.564 --> 10:37.567
Have you told your wife about
what you're experiencing?

10:40.871 --> 10:43.756
At first, I told her everything.

10:45.257 --> 10:49.746
How he'd given up football
and gone back to tennis.

10:50.113 --> 10:54.050
About the girl
who kept calling him.

10:54.117 --> 10:55.005
I don't know,

10:55.006 --> 10:58.555
I think maybe I thought I could
be a bridge, or something.

10:58.622 --> 11:00.457
That even if they couldn't see each other,

11:00.524 --> 11:02.025
maybe if I told her about him,

11:02.092 --> 11:04.194
it would be like we were
all still together.

11:07.531 --> 11:11.034
You know, but to her,
he's not still alive,

11:11.101 --> 11:14.671
and, uh...
hearing about it,

11:14.738 --> 11:16.940
talking about it wasn't comforting.

11:18.575 --> 11:20.710
It was torture.

11:20.777 --> 11:23.425
Just as you continue to
imagine a life with him,

11:23.426 --> 11:26.883
your wife is coping by beginning
to imagine a life without him.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.496
But I assure you,

11:28.497 --> 11:30.812
however she might appear,

11:30.813 --> 11:33.590
she's not grieving any less.

11:33.657 --> 11:36.726
Did she tell you
why she wants to move?

11:39.596 --> 11:40.964
She says it's...

11:41.031 --> 11:43.233
too hard to live with the
empty room upstairs.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.868
And yet,

11:44.935 --> 11:48.905
you're determined to stay there.

11:51.208 --> 11:54.277
MICHAEL: For me, the room
upstairs isn't empty.

12:01.117 --> 12:03.453
Well, thanks for your help.
Yeah.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.989
- Hey, Bird!
- Yeah.

12:06.056 --> 12:08.091
We got a stolen car found
in the neighborhood.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.660
It's got to be how the
killer got to the scene.

12:10.727 --> 12:12.762
The neighbors said they saw
it as early as 5:00 p.m.

12:12.829 --> 12:14.331
Time of death isn't till 9:00.

12:14.397 --> 12:15.799
So, if he just wants to rip off a couple

12:15.866 --> 12:17.000
of rich people, what's he waiting for?

12:17.067 --> 12:18.935
The girl. She doesn't get
dropped off till 8:45.

12:19.002 --> 12:20.270
15 minutes later,
the parents are dead,

12:20.337 --> 12:21.638
and they're out of there.

12:21.705 --> 12:22.933
You say they were supposed
to be at a meeting?

12:22.934 --> 12:23.240
Uh-huh.

12:23.306 --> 12:25.809
So, guy thinks he's gonna find
her alone, when he doesn't...

12:25.876 --> 12:27.310
He knows her, he knows them.

12:27.377 --> 12:28.712
This wasn't a robbery.

12:28.778 --> 12:31.047
This was a planned abduction.

12:32.816 --> 12:35.118
- Let's talk to the watch commander.
- Okay, come on.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.156
Hey.

12:39.222 --> 12:42.125
Uh, I got something I got to do.

12:42.192 --> 12:43.426
Now?

12:43.493 --> 12:45.762
I just need an hour.
Two, max.

12:45.829 --> 12:47.130
For what?

12:47.197 --> 12:50.634
I told someone
I'd be somewhere.

12:54.271 --> 12:55.238
BRITTEN: Yeah!

12:59.609 --> 13:01.545
After two years playing football,

13:01.611 --> 13:04.781
I didn't expect him to end up in the final.

13:04.848 --> 13:06.650
Tara. I'm the coach.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.852
- Oh. Right. How do you do?
- Hi.

13:11.054 --> 13:12.622
He's exceptionally talented.

13:12.689 --> 13:14.524
He had a very good teacher.

13:14.591 --> 13:16.526
I'm so sorry.

13:16.593 --> 13:18.862
Your wife was an amazing person.

13:18.929 --> 13:21.631
Thanks.

13:21.698 --> 13:24.234
You know, uh, we used to
play doubles together.

13:24.301 --> 13:25.235
Very briefly.

13:25.302 --> 13:27.137
She used to mop the floor with us kids

13:27.204 --> 13:28.839
who thought we were ready for the tour.

13:28.905 --> 13:31.141
She's the one who should
have played professionally.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.742
You think so?

13:32.809 --> 13:35.478
I did. She was better than me.

13:35.545 --> 13:37.881
I guess the grind just
didn't appeal to her.

13:37.948 --> 13:40.417
Appealed to you, though?

13:40.483 --> 13:42.786
Thought it would be a lot
more winning Wimbledon

13:42.853 --> 13:45.188
and less qualifying in New Jersey.

13:47.090 --> 13:50.126
I don't really know what
he's doing out there.

13:50.193 --> 13:51.828
He just...

13:51.895 --> 13:55.398
It was his mother he used
to talk to, you know?

13:55.465 --> 13:57.567
We've talked about it a little.

13:57.634 --> 13:59.569
Really?

13:59.636 --> 14:01.204
What does he say?

14:01.271 --> 14:03.507
He misses her a lot.

14:03.573 --> 14:05.842
This helps him miss her a little less.

14:05.909 --> 14:07.911
(applause)

14:10.280 --> 14:11.581
Match point.

14:11.648 --> 14:14.417
You know, if he wins this
easily after a long layoff,

14:14.484 --> 14:16.386
I may never get him to practice.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.628
Yeah!

14:24.694 --> 14:27.430
(applause and whistling)

14:33.136 --> 14:34.838
Rex?

14:34.905 --> 14:36.840
Hey.

14:37.874 --> 14:39.442
Rex?

14:39.509 --> 14:40.610
Son, you okay?

14:40.677 --> 14:42.445
Hey, you're okay.

14:42.512 --> 14:44.281
(crying) It's okay.

14:44.347 --> 14:45.515
Okay.

14:45.582 --> 14:46.683
(crying continues)

14:46.750 --> 14:50.120
Okay.

14:50.187 --> 14:51.922
That is the best show on TV.

14:51.988 --> 14:53.223
No way.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.703
I watch total garbage TV, and
I don't even watch that.

14:55.704 --> 14:57.828
REX: Oh, come on.
It's about models.

14:57.894 --> 14:59.563
I think that holds a different appeal

14:59.629 --> 15:03.033
for a 15 year-old boy
than it does for me.

15:03.099 --> 15:05.502
What about you, Michael?

15:06.603 --> 15:07.771
You have a favorite show?

15:07.838 --> 15:09.773
Uh... yeah.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.375
I like the one with the, uh,
deranged chef.

15:12.442 --> 15:14.077
Really?

15:14.144 --> 15:15.645
I always thought
Mom recorded that.

15:15.712 --> 15:17.447
No, that's me.

15:17.514 --> 15:18.915
Why?
You like it?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.419
It's okay.

15:24.955 --> 15:27.824
Did you see the one where
he made that guy...?

15:27.891 --> 15:29.559
(phone buzzing)

15:31.528 --> 15:33.396
It's fine.

15:33.463 --> 15:34.898
Hey, sorry.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.401
Yeah. Britten.

15:38.468 --> 15:39.836
Hey, it's Bird.

15:39.903 --> 15:41.171
We found the kidnapper's car.

15:41.238 --> 15:43.173
Waverly Long Term Parking lot
by the docks.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.574
How quick can you get here?

15:44.641 --> 15:46.910
Yeah, I got to take Rex
home, and then, uh...

15:46.977 --> 15:49.079
TARA: I can take
him if you want.

15:49.145 --> 15:50.313
Yeah, I'll get a ride with Tara.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.749
You sure that's okay?

15:54.417 --> 15:56.586
Uh, I'll be right there.

15:57.854 --> 15:59.289
Thanks.

15:59.356 --> 16:01.758
TARA: Sure.

16:04.661 --> 16:06.997
REX: Dad?

16:07.063 --> 16:09.166
Um...

16:09.232 --> 16:10.500
I'm...

16:10.567 --> 16:12.903
I'm glad you came today.

16:12.969 --> 16:14.971
Me, too.

16:21.311 --> 16:23.547
This your idea or Tara's?

16:23.613 --> 16:27.117
She-she's good at this kind of stuff.

16:29.519 --> 16:31.054
All right.

16:31.121 --> 16:32.756
I'll see you at home.

16:32.823 --> 16:35.292
I won't be late, I promise.

16:35.358 --> 16:36.560
BRITTEN: What do we got?

16:36.626 --> 16:38.562
BIRD: Lot security found the parents' car.

16:38.628 --> 16:40.597
Now, from the blood trail here,

16:40.664 --> 16:43.677
it looks like the kidnapper takes
the girl out of the stolen Beemer

16:43.678 --> 16:46.069
and sticks her into whatever
was parked in space 572.

16:46.136 --> 16:47.571
Take a look.

16:47.637 --> 16:49.039
Now, it was drizzling an hour ago.

16:49.105 --> 16:51.222
The crime guy shot these
before the ground dried.

16:51.223 --> 16:54.077
Now, the plan is to go over the plate
numbers of all the cars in the lot,

16:54.144 --> 16:56.046
and see if anybody saw anything.

16:56.112 --> 16:58.114
See if they remember what
was parked in space 572.

16:58.181 --> 16:59.916
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually...

16:59.983 --> 17:02.500
let's see if they remember
what was parked behind him

17:02.501 --> 17:03.153
in space 611.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.289
611. Why?

17:06.356 --> 17:09.626
Well, look, they both got a
dry spot, about the same, so,

17:09.693 --> 17:12.662
I figure 611 left the same time as 572.

17:12.729 --> 17:14.396
Whoever was parked in 611

17:14.464 --> 17:16.566
probably the last person to
see the kidnapper's car.

17:16.633 --> 17:17.968
Wait a minute, so you're saying,

17:18.034 --> 17:19.269
you want to ask people

17:19.336 --> 17:21.605
about the space the car
wasn't  parked in?

17:21.671 --> 17:23.807
You know what?
I'll call myself.

17:23.874 --> 17:26.409
Just send me all the numbers,
I'll call from home.

17:26.476 --> 17:28.745
You okay?

17:28.812 --> 17:31.681
Yeah.

17:31.748 --> 17:33.717
How's Rex?

17:33.783 --> 17:35.852
I mean, how's he doing?

17:35.919 --> 17:38.488
He lost his mother.

17:38.555 --> 17:40.757
How's anybody supposed to handle that?

17:40.824 --> 17:42.192
Don't forget, we have dinner tonight.

17:42.259 --> 17:43.894
- Reservation's at 8:00.
- Mm-hmm.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.363
Um, do me a favor.

17:46.429 --> 17:48.665
Don't wear
any of your suits from work.

17:48.732 --> 17:51.034
They creep me out.

17:51.101 --> 17:53.103
(indistinct chatter on TV)

17:53.170 --> 17:55.172
(sighs)

17:58.175 --> 18:00.544
(cheering, indistinct chatter)

18:02.879 --> 18:04.181
- Hey, Vega?
- Yeah.

18:04.247 --> 18:05.448
Pull the tapes.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.050
- The security tapes?
- Yeah.

18:07.117 --> 18:08.318
We've seen 'em, like, 100 times.

18:08.385 --> 18:09.619
This guy...
once he ditches the disguise,

18:09.686 --> 18:11.688
he could come back and stand
in the crowd all day,

18:11.755 --> 18:12.856
we'd never know it.

18:12.923 --> 18:14.057
Why would he do that?

18:14.124 --> 18:16.092
Think about it...
look into the camera, the disguises.

18:16.159 --> 18:17.894
He loves that he can
practically turn himself in,

18:17.961 --> 18:19.129
and we still can't catch him.

18:19.196 --> 18:20.397
I'm willing to bet he likes

18:20.463 --> 18:22.199
to have a front row seat to watch us flail.

18:22.265 --> 18:24.401
And we run the tapes through
the hours  after  the murders,

18:24.467 --> 18:27.003
maybe we can catch a face
that pops out in both crowds.

18:27.070 --> 18:27.691
Yeah?

18:27.692 --> 18:30.173
Black beard and a wig matching
the eyewitness descriptions

18:30.240 --> 18:31.408
turned up in a Dumpster

18:31.474 --> 18:33.643
15 blocks
from the second cab murder scene.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.046
Managed to pull a single
red hair from the wig.

18:36.112 --> 18:37.714
- We'll run the DNA.
- Oh, great.

18:37.781 --> 18:39.549
Yeah, but the database is so small.

18:39.616 --> 18:41.551
Unless he's been in some
serious trouble before,

18:41.618 --> 18:43.086
we probably won't get a hit.

18:43.153 --> 18:44.387
All right, thanks.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.857
Well, we know we're looking for a redhead.

18:46.923 --> 18:47.891
That's something, right?

18:47.958 --> 18:49.993
Yeah.

18:50.060 --> 18:52.028
Pull the tapes.

18:53.930 --> 18:56.733
All right, first up, 611 Waverly.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.636
All right, Ginger.
Where are you?

18:59.703 --> 19:01.004
What did you say?

19:01.071 --> 19:02.572
Ginger?

19:02.639 --> 19:05.008
No.
611 Waverly?

19:05.075 --> 19:09.279
Yeah, the restaurant where
the first cabbie got killed.

19:09.346 --> 19:13.350
That's the address.
Why?

19:13.416 --> 19:16.887
BRITTEN: There's a Waverly Parking
Lot out by the docks, right?

19:16.953 --> 19:19.923
Well, what does that have to do
with this?

19:23.026 --> 19:24.861
Britten?
Hey, are you okay?

19:26.628 --> 19:28.131
Play the tape.

19:30.563 --> 19:32.165
Oh, I'd say it's entirely reasonable.

19:32.232 --> 19:34.400
It's even expected that
these sorts of details

19:34.467 --> 19:35.802
would begin to cross over.

19:35.869 --> 19:38.648
The things you're wrestling
with in real life

19:38.649 --> 19:41.608
are likely to manifest
themselves in your dream.

19:41.674 --> 19:44.511
I knew about the Waverly
parking lot and space 611

19:44.577 --> 19:48.047
before I knew the address of
the first cab driver murder.

19:48.114 --> 19:50.783
So, how could I have dreamed
it before I knew it?

19:50.850 --> 19:52.619
But did you?

19:52.685 --> 19:54.921
You said yourself they
were on the paperwork.

19:54.988 --> 19:57.524
You were at the location.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.859
Even if you didn't consciously
note it, your brain might've,

19:59.926 --> 20:02.829
and if it found it important
enough, the details...

20:02.896 --> 20:04.631
Waverly, 611...

20:04.697 --> 20:06.733
would simply manifest themselves

20:06.799 --> 20:09.168
in your dreams via this
imaginary parking lot.

20:09.235 --> 20:13.506
Or I really saw it in
the parking lot first,

20:13.573 --> 20:15.975
and it's repeating itself
now, in this dream here,

20:16.042 --> 20:18.444
to tell me that there's something important

20:18.511 --> 20:19.779
going on there.

20:23.716 --> 20:25.385
Detective Britten,

20:25.451 --> 20:26.692
as I said,

20:26.693 --> 20:28.996
there's no therapeutic
value in allowing you

20:28.997 --> 20:31.658
to pretend that your realities
are interchangeable.

20:31.724 --> 20:33.927
There's no kidnapped child.

20:33.993 --> 20:36.029
There's no car in a parking lot.

20:36.095 --> 20:38.431
And sadly, but crucially,

20:38.498 --> 20:42.498
there's no world in which your
son survived the accident.

20:47.874 --> 20:51.578
Yeah, well,
with all due respect, Doctor,

20:51.644 --> 20:53.880
I don't know that that's true.

20:53.947 --> 20:54.967
If it isn't, then,

20:54.968 --> 20:57.517
there's a kidnapped
girl who needs my help.

20:57.584 --> 20:59.986
Okay, so,
then, let me ask you this.

21:00.053 --> 21:02.055
Which murder came first?

21:03.890 --> 21:05.625
The cab driver.

21:05.692 --> 21:07.594
So, you begin working on one case,

21:07.660 --> 21:10.029
here, in reality,
and then, suddenly,

21:10.096 --> 21:13.366
you begin working another case,
there, in your dream.

21:13.433 --> 21:14.684
And we should also talk about

21:14.685 --> 21:16.970
the kind of case that you're
working in your dream.

21:19.005 --> 21:20.540
A missing child.

21:20.607 --> 21:23.827
It's the very issue you're
struggling to come to terms with,

21:23.828 --> 21:27.046
so your subconscious turns it
into a case you have to solve.

21:29.148 --> 21:31.584
I understand the pain you feel,
Detective,

21:31.651 --> 21:34.787
but that pain is echoing
in your dreams to tell you

21:34.854 --> 21:38.358
you have to deal with it,
and not to ignore it.

21:38.424 --> 21:40.560
And when you do,

21:40.627 --> 21:44.627
these dreams, fantasies... will end.

21:46.299 --> 21:48.868
And, eventually,
so will your pain.

21:48.935 --> 21:50.403
BRITTEN: So you're saying

21:50.470 --> 21:54.607
as soon as I decide
which one is dead,

21:54.674 --> 21:58.044
then they'll stop showing up
in my dreams?

21:58.111 --> 22:00.346
I believe that's very likely.

22:02.148 --> 22:03.716
HANNAH: What?

22:03.783 --> 22:05.718
Nothing.

22:05.785 --> 22:07.320
It's just nice to be out.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.162
You already applied?

22:19.766 --> 22:21.701
What?

22:21.768 --> 22:23.236
You think I'm too old?

22:23.303 --> 22:25.638
Oh, I'm sure you can do keg
stands with the best of them.

22:25.705 --> 22:27.841
I just...

22:27.907 --> 22:30.443
What about your work?

22:30.510 --> 22:31.778
I quit.

22:31.845 --> 22:34.180
Really?

22:36.516 --> 22:39.786
Okay.

22:39.853 --> 22:42.088
Uh, and where are these schools at?

22:42.155 --> 22:44.090
Well, one of them's in the city,

22:44.157 --> 22:45.592
and the other one is in Oregon.

22:45.658 --> 22:46.659
Oregon.

22:48.695 --> 22:52.532
Is that why you wanted to
get dressed up, come out?

22:52.599 --> 22:54.434
Have this little chat?

22:54.500 --> 22:56.836
No, I wanted to get dressed up and go out

22:56.903 --> 23:00.903
because I think it's time we
start doing things again.

23:05.645 --> 23:08.515
You remember that restaurant
in New York like this?

23:08.581 --> 23:10.083
Fancy place.

23:10.149 --> 23:11.684
You pretended to be a food critic.

23:11.751 --> 23:15.655
You got us that great table,
that huge meal, all for free.

23:15.722 --> 23:17.724
What made you think of that?

23:17.790 --> 23:21.790
I was just thinking about
how persuasive you can be.

23:22.095 --> 23:24.197
("Maybe Not" by Cat Power playing)

23:24.264 --> 23:28.264

see, I pray it can be ♪

23:29.702 --> 23:33.339
♪ Look cross the land, shake this land ♪

23:38.044 --> 23:40.046

I think we should go home.

24:15.515 --> 24:17.083
And-and say what you will about

24:17.150 --> 24:18.751
us not working through our issues yet,

24:18.818 --> 24:22.188
but it's not about replacing him.

24:22.255 --> 24:24.991
Okay?
It's not.

24:25.058 --> 24:28.361
I just know that I'm going
to want to have another one.

24:28.428 --> 24:31.698
And I don't, I don't want to be
100 when he's in high school.

24:31.764 --> 24:34.200
How do you know it would be a boy?

24:34.267 --> 24:35.869
What?

24:35.935 --> 24:39.038
"When he's in high school,"
you said so.

24:39.105 --> 24:40.039
Oh.

24:40.106 --> 24:42.475
How do you know?

24:42.542 --> 24:44.646
- I don't.
- Yeah.

24:46.913 --> 24:48.515
So, what do you think?

24:51.684 --> 24:54.821
I think we should think about it.

24:54.888 --> 24:57.123
For a while.
Okay?

24:57.190 --> 24:58.925
Mm-hmm.

25:03.830 --> 25:06.766
How's the house coming along?

25:06.833 --> 25:09.936
Just one more room.

25:10.003 --> 25:11.271
Yeah.

25:11.337 --> 25:13.339
(sighs)

25:15.341 --> 25:18.077
Did I tell you about my
partner's kid playing tennis?

25:18.144 --> 25:19.879
Hmm?

25:19.946 --> 25:21.648
This kid.

25:21.714 --> 25:23.750
Reminds me of you.

25:23.816 --> 25:25.785
- Me?
- Yeah.

25:25.852 --> 25:28.621
The way... he hit the ball.

25:28.688 --> 25:30.356
I mean, 25 aces in the final.

25:30.423 --> 25:32.825
He crushed the serve.

25:32.892 --> 25:36.663
It was like he poured his
whole body into it, you know?

25:36.729 --> 25:39.465
And he'd...
he'd drive and shoot the forehand,

25:39.532 --> 25:42.268
and catching it,
like you're always saying.

25:42.335 --> 25:44.404
Damn it, Michael.

25:44.470 --> 25:45.705
I'm sorry.

25:45.772 --> 25:48.474
You can't do that to me.

25:49.876 --> 25:52.946
Are you having these dreams again?

25:53.012 --> 25:55.093
I had one.

25:55.094 --> 25:57.383
He's gone.

25:57.450 --> 26:00.019
I miss him, too, Michael, desperately.

26:00.086 --> 26:02.689
But he's gone.

26:17.937 --> 26:20.807
What's the psychiatrist say about it all?

26:20.874 --> 26:22.308
Oh, you know,

26:22.375 --> 26:26.379
he's explaining to me stuff
about sleep, dreams.

26:26.446 --> 26:28.481
How everything works.

26:28.548 --> 26:32.085
HANNAH: Is it helping?

26:32.151 --> 26:34.587
BRITTEN: Yeah.

26:34.654 --> 26:37.657
I feel better
every time I open my eyes.

26:42.099 --> 26:43.133
You suddenly seem very concerned

26:43.200 --> 26:44.901
about what's real and what's not.

26:46.952 --> 26:48.554
Well, Dr. Lee said a couple of things

26:48.621 --> 26:50.155
that I'm having trouble letting go of.

26:50.222 --> 26:51.290
I think it's useful

26:51.357 --> 26:55.060
to ask yourself
why you might have created

26:55.127 --> 26:57.997
a therapist
who is so confrontational.

26:58.063 --> 27:00.699
Is that your vision of
how this should work?

27:00.766 --> 27:01.967
No, that's the whole point.

27:02.034 --> 27:04.670
Why would I invent someone
who argues with me?

27:04.737 --> 27:06.605
Dr. Lee would say that

27:06.672 --> 27:09.141
the reason that you're so
gentle, agreeing with me

27:09.208 --> 27:12.177
because you...
'cause you are me.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.313
So it's his very nature that
has you somehow focused

27:14.380 --> 27:16.815
on the idea that he's real,

27:16.882 --> 27:19.451
and has this all, suddenly,

27:19.518 --> 27:21.854
feeling like your dream.

27:21.921 --> 27:23.856
Okay.

27:23.923 --> 27:25.925
What?

27:28.394 --> 27:30.863
Just give me a minute.

27:30.930 --> 27:33.265
What are you doing?

27:33.332 --> 27:35.334
(printer whirrs)

27:43.709 --> 27:45.611
All right.

27:45.678 --> 27:47.646
Here.

27:47.713 --> 27:50.282
Turn to any page.

27:50.349 --> 27:52.518
Just pick one.

27:52.585 --> 27:56.121
And now, pick a spot about
halfway down and start reading.

27:56.188 --> 27:57.423
Out loud.

28:01.527 --> 28:03.495
"The House of Representatives
shall be composed

28:03.562 --> 28:05.297
"of members chosen every second year

28:05.364 --> 28:07.132
"by the people of the several states,

28:07.199 --> 28:08.901
"and the electors in each state

28:08.968 --> 28:10.970
"shall have the
qualifications requisite..."

28:11.036 --> 28:12.504
What's going on?

28:12.571 --> 28:14.139
What am I...
What am I doing here?

28:14.206 --> 28:17.576
Have you memorized
the entire Constitution?

28:17.643 --> 28:19.712
No.

28:19.778 --> 28:21.413
Then, if this is a dream,

28:21.480 --> 28:25.451
and your son has really
died, instead of your wife,

28:25.517 --> 28:29.088
and you're just making
all of this up,

28:29.154 --> 28:33.259
explain to me how you could
turn to a random page

28:33.325 --> 28:36.528
and start quoting it back,
word for word.

28:42.935 --> 28:45.070
I can't.

28:45.137 --> 28:47.139
I don't know.

28:47.206 --> 28:48.507
Tell Dr. Lee

28:48.574 --> 28:49.908
that Dr. Evans says

28:49.975 --> 28:53.245
that it's not as simple
as he made it sound.

29:01.002 --> 29:03.171
Why would you do that?

29:05.009 --> 29:07.509
You seem distracted by this fear

29:07.887 --> 29:09.956
that Dr. Lee had made some sort of

29:10.022 --> 29:11.991
bulletproof argument, and
I just thought that...

29:12.058 --> 29:14.760
No, no, you said nobody should...

29:14.827 --> 29:16.495
Wh...

29:16.562 --> 29:18.364
I don't know the Constitution.

29:18.431 --> 29:19.699
So, how could I...

29:19.765 --> 29:23.236
How could I do that
unless this is...

29:47.627 --> 29:50.630
(groaning)

30:05.067 --> 30:06.369
Hannah?

30:07.701 --> 30:09.036
Hannah!

30:09.102 --> 30:10.639
Hannah?

30:12.306 --> 30:14.675
Hannah, you in there?

30:17.311 --> 30:18.712
Hi, it's Hannah;
leave a message.

30:18.779 --> 30:20.380
(voicemail beeps) Hey, it's me.

30:20.447 --> 30:21.715
Uh, where are you?

30:21.782 --> 30:24.084
I mean, I don't know
where you are, so, uh...

30:24.151 --> 30:25.452
I'm not sure what's going on.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.554
It would be great to hear your voice, okay?

30:27.621 --> 30:28.689
Just give me a call.

30:28.755 --> 30:29.790
Rex?

30:29.857 --> 30:30.991
Rex!

30:32.693 --> 30:33.994
No, no, no.

30:34.061 --> 30:37.197
She's here;
she's here.

30:37.264 --> 30:39.299
Hannah!

30:39.366 --> 30:41.135
Rex?

30:41.935 --> 30:43.770
Michael...

30:43.837 --> 30:44.505
Come on!

30:49.877 --> 30:52.880
(groaning)

30:54.515 --> 30:55.916
Michael?

30:55.983 --> 30:57.284
What are you doing?

30:57.351 --> 30:58.385
Thank God you're still here.

30:58.452 --> 31:01.255
Of course I'm still here.

31:01.321 --> 31:02.256
What's going on?

31:02.322 --> 31:03.991
I was calling your name.

31:04.057 --> 31:05.333
Why do you not hear
me calling your name?

31:05.334 --> 31:06.093
Listen to me, it's okay.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.629
All right?
I'm not going anywhere.

31:10.697 --> 31:12.933
Let me see your hand.

31:36.056 --> 31:38.525
VEGA: Can you at least tell
me what we're looking for?

31:38.592 --> 31:40.294
- Maybe I can help.
- I'm not sure.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.529
Well, then...
Why are we here?

31:42.596 --> 31:44.798
I had a dream about it.

31:44.865 --> 31:47.167
Or I'm having a dream.

31:47.234 --> 31:50.270
- What?
- Nothing.

31:50.337 --> 31:54.374
Look, we still have partial face matches
from the tapes to look over, okay?

31:54.441 --> 31:54.928
(sighs)

31:54.929 --> 31:56.877
We... we got witnesses
from the other scene.

31:56.944 --> 31:58.912
The witness.

31:58.979 --> 31:59.947
Yeah.

32:00.013 --> 32:01.715
The guy from 611, Weaver.

32:01.782 --> 32:02.616
Mm-hmm.

32:02.683 --> 32:04.485
He said he saw the killer

32:04.551 --> 32:06.353
run up the street, turn left at the alley.

32:06.420 --> 32:07.554
Yeah, all the witnesses confirmed

32:07.621 --> 32:08.856
that he ran in that direction.

32:08.922 --> 32:10.123
That's what the security tape shows.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.058
I mean, that's what happened.

32:11.124 --> 32:13.727
Did you go up to his apartment?
Look out of his window?

32:13.794 --> 32:14.895
No, why would I?

32:14.962 --> 32:17.297
Everyone had the same story.

32:17.364 --> 32:19.967
There's no window
on the other side.

32:20.033 --> 32:22.035
If you're on the ground, you
can see the alley from here.

32:22.102 --> 32:23.337
See the killer turn into it.

32:23.403 --> 32:26.006
From up there, there's
no way you know that.

32:26.073 --> 32:27.975
Unless you're the one who actually did it.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.744
Call it in.

32:30.811 --> 32:32.913
Hold on.

32:34.281 --> 32:35.749
Is there another entrance?

32:35.816 --> 32:37.050
Yeah, the back.

32:37.117 --> 32:38.552
Cover it.

32:38.619 --> 32:40.621
(elevator bell dings)

32:50.264 --> 32:51.265
Hey!

32:52.232 --> 32:53.367
(frustrated growl)

32:59.706 --> 33:01.308
Move it! Stop!

33:02.876 --> 33:04.945
Police officer!
Get out of the way!

33:05.312 --> 33:06.547
(people screaming) Police!

33:36.877 --> 33:39.279
VEGA:  The guy had an
apartment full of costumes,

33:39.346 --> 33:40.747
teaches eighth grade math.

33:44.284 --> 33:46.286
You were joking, right?

33:46.353 --> 33:47.754
About what?

33:47.821 --> 33:50.290
Coming back here
because of a dream.

33:50.357 --> 33:53.660
I mean, that's not why we came, right?

33:53.727 --> 33:56.063
'Cause you doing stuff like that,
it's, uh,

33:56.129 --> 33:58.298
the sort of thing they've
been asking me about.

33:58.365 --> 33:59.366
What have you been saying?

34:01.401 --> 34:02.870
Nothing.

34:12.813 --> 34:14.982
BIRD: Mike, you've been
staring at that pavement

34:15.047 --> 34:16.483
for the last hour.

34:16.550 --> 34:18.252
I think it's told you what it knows.

34:19.620 --> 34:23.223
Look, the blood trail led
right to the car in 572.

34:23.290 --> 34:25.958
Why does it matter
what was parked in 611?

34:26.025 --> 34:27.460
I mean, don't you think

34:27.527 --> 34:28.829
if they would've seen anything,
like, say,

34:28.896 --> 34:30.864
a bleeding little girl being
forced out of one car

34:30.931 --> 34:31.998
and into another,

34:32.065 --> 34:33.534
that we would've heard from them by now?

34:33.600 --> 34:36.103
Wait.

34:36.170 --> 34:38.205
- Wait, that's it.
- What's it?

34:38.272 --> 34:39.672
But we assumed
that these vehicles

34:39.739 --> 34:41.842
- left at about the same time.
- Okay.

34:41.909 --> 34:43.177
What if they left
at exactly the same time?

34:43.243 --> 34:45.012
You see that dry patch
right there?

34:45.078 --> 34:46.380
That's a tow hitch.

34:46.446 --> 34:47.414
It wasn't a pickup truck here.

34:47.481 --> 34:49.983
It was a...
a trailer or an RV in 611.

34:51.585 --> 34:52.686
We got four camper hits

34:52.753 --> 34:54.588
in the same area we canvass
for sex offenders.

34:54.655 --> 34:55.956
Three of them are sitting
in their driveways.

34:56.023 --> 34:58.225
And they're sending teams
to check them out.

34:58.292 --> 35:00.727
And the other just turned up
by a lake in the foothills.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.296
Ranger says the guy's
been there since Monday.

35:02.362 --> 35:03.964
- Day of the murders.
- Uh-huh.

35:04.031 --> 35:05.299
Have you seen his I.D.?

35:05.365 --> 35:06.567
Did the guy have red hair?

35:06.633 --> 35:08.335
Red hair?
Why?

35:09.203 --> 35:11.071
No reason.

35:12.105 --> 35:14.871
Okay, look, uh, tell them to
keep a distant perimeter;

35:14.872 --> 35:15.776
we're on our way.

35:21.335 --> 35:23.004
Moving up.

35:33.441 --> 35:34.642
What do you got?

35:34.709 --> 35:36.512
Suspect's inside with the little girl.

35:36.498 --> 35:38.600
- Saw it with your own eyes?
- Yes, sir.

35:38.667 --> 35:41.002
What's the best approach?

36:06.561 --> 36:09.431
(girl whimpering, crying quietly)

36:16.371 --> 36:18.440
(no voice)

36:37.792 --> 36:40.095
On the right.

36:44.666 --> 36:46.001
(whimpering)

36:46.067 --> 36:47.435
(no voice)

36:47.502 --> 36:49.237
(whimpers)

36:49.304 --> 36:50.705
(quietly): You're safe.

36:55.543 --> 36:57.679
Didn't I tell you what would
happened if you tried to get away?

36:58.246 --> 37:00.415
(gunfire)

37:13.295 --> 37:15.330
BIRD: She says he kept
talking about marrying her.

37:16.888 --> 37:19.257
That the Lord
had brought them together.

37:22.253 --> 37:25.056
You want to tell me how
you knew he had red hair?

37:29.727 --> 37:31.729
A hunch.

37:32.763 --> 37:36.233
Been a cop for 20 years.
I only seen hunches on TV.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.735
(wry laugh)

37:39.634 --> 37:41.669
So you're gonna stick with that?

37:41.736 --> 37:44.005
Uh-huh.

37:44.072 --> 37:46.074
Okay.

37:48.443 --> 37:51.713
BRITTEN: She got family to go to?

37:51.779 --> 37:54.248
An aunt or something.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.517
I'm not even sure she
understands what happened yet.

37:59.153 --> 38:00.221
(sighs heavily)

38:00.288 --> 38:05.343
Remember when you used to think
that "solved" and "fixed"

38:05.344 --> 38:07.261
meant the same thing?

38:09.530 --> 38:10.998
Your mind will allow you to go

38:11.065 --> 38:12.667
endlessly back and forth
between these realities,

38:12.734 --> 38:13.901
if you let it.

38:13.968 --> 38:16.604
You've created
a mental Mobius strip.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.373
How would you like me to help you

38:18.439 --> 38:19.707
if you're not willing to participate

38:19.774 --> 38:22.577
in a realistic examination
of your situation?

38:22.643 --> 38:24.746
I never said I needed help.

38:24.812 --> 38:27.615
They did.
I'm fine.

38:33.821 --> 38:35.323
Your Blood Alcohol Level

38:35.390 --> 38:38.559
was elevated the night of
the accident, wasn't it?

38:38.626 --> 38:41.462
I didn't have anything to drink.

38:41.529 --> 38:43.097
Uh, that's what you said,

38:43.164 --> 38:47.268
but the medical report says that
it was elevated, was it not?

38:52.340 --> 38:55.309
Have you considered the possibility

38:55.376 --> 38:57.478
that your condition comes not so much

38:57.545 --> 39:00.181
from a benevolent desire
to keep your son alive,

39:00.248 --> 39:02.817
but an intense need to shield yourself

39:02.884 --> 39:05.720
from your own responsibility for his death?

39:08.256 --> 39:10.658
It does raise a whole host of questions.

39:10.725 --> 39:14.962
I'm telling you, there is no
way that I drank that night.

39:15.997 --> 39:18.032
But you don't remember anything

39:18.099 --> 39:19.801
about what led to the accident?

39:21.869 --> 39:24.105
No.

39:24.172 --> 39:25.961
Maybe this is all your way

39:25.962 --> 39:28.576
of trying to help
yourself remember.

39:28.643 --> 39:32.447
Just as you seem to work out
your cases in your dreams,

39:32.513 --> 39:35.183
perhaps the fact that
your wife survived in one

39:35.249 --> 39:36.417
and your son in the other,

39:36.484 --> 39:40.955
or that you have different
partners in each,

39:41.022 --> 39:42.857
is actually all a way of getting you

39:42.924 --> 39:44.592
to think about that night.

39:44.659 --> 39:47.562
Clues, so to speak, about
what actually happened.

39:49.063 --> 39:52.200
Detective Britten,
this fantasy is far from benign.

39:52.266 --> 39:55.436
While your brain should
be resting, recharging,

39:55.503 --> 39:59.240
your subconscious is using it to
hold up a detail and complicated

39:59.307 --> 40:01.576
alternate reality.

40:01.642 --> 40:04.612
If we don't deal with that...

40:04.679 --> 40:07.482
this situation will eventually
become unsustainable.

40:07.548 --> 40:10.485
Look at your hand.

40:10.551 --> 40:12.186
The moment of panic, of confusion,

40:12.253 --> 40:15.556
that led you to do that to yourself...

40:15.623 --> 40:19.394
that's just the tip of an iceberg.

40:22.430 --> 40:24.432
The thing is, Doctor...

40:26.434 --> 40:31.039
yes,
I still see my wife and my son.

40:31.105 --> 40:35.105
And I've also watched both of
them lowered into the ground.

40:35.743 --> 40:39.743
And when you see a loved one buried...

40:41.082 --> 40:45.082
you have one thought, over
and over and over again,

40:46.921 --> 40:50.921
and that's that you would do anything...

40:51.826 --> 40:54.462
anything...
to get them back.

40:54.529 --> 40:58.199
So if you're telling me that
the price of seeing them,

40:58.266 --> 41:00.401
feeling them...

41:02.103 --> 41:04.772
of having them in my life,

41:04.839 --> 41:07.075
is my sanity?

41:09.377 --> 41:12.080
It's a price I will happily pay.

41:12.146 --> 41:15.450
Now, I'll come and see you,

41:15.516 --> 41:19.287
and talk to you
As long as they make me.

41:19.354 --> 41:21.556
But trust me,

41:21.622 --> 41:23.624
when it comes
to letting one of them go...

41:26.627 --> 41:28.947
I have no desire

41:28.948 --> 41:32.427
to ever make progress.

41:34.869 --> 41:36.871
You going to see him tonight?

41:42.877 --> 41:45.213
Yeah.

41:47.248 --> 41:49.250
Tell him I love him.

41:54.489 --> 41:56.491
I will.
