WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:05.504
(sirens wailing,
helicopter blades whirring)

00:05.506 --> 00:07.773
REPORTER: ...at this time
believed is responsible,

00:07.775 --> 00:10.509
but there's speculation about
a lone gunman firing at random.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.212
WOMAN: I saw her!
She was shot in the chest!

00:13.214 --> 00:14.680
There was blood everywhere!

00:52.620 --> 00:55.687
(reporters clamoring,
camera shutters clicking)

00:59.593 --> 01:01.593
REPORTER:
Can you tell me anything about

01:01.595 --> 01:03.429
what happened inside?

01:03.431 --> 01:05.497
(reporters shouting questions)

01:07.635 --> 01:09.368
(camera shutters clicking)

01:19.680 --> 01:22.681
I just want to shower up
and go to bed.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.718
Let's hope SIU feels
the same way.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.322
Sequestered means no talking
till after your interview.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.558
Sorry, guys,
they make me say that.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.726
Look, under
the circumstances,

01:34.728 --> 01:36.562
think maybe we can
sequester ourselves home

01:36.564 --> 01:37.796
and do these interviews
tomorrow?

01:37.798 --> 01:40.599
It's procedure,
and it's not just SIU.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.434
The whole country's in shock.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.769
You saw all the media out there.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.671
Everybody's gonna be needing
answers.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.339
We're all under
the microscope here.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.740
Well, you have
our full cooperation.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.744
Team One, cross T's and dot I's.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.379
I'm the subject officer.
Let's get it done.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.815
Good. I'll start with you.
Where's your lawyer?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.183
Let's just forget the lawyer.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.818
We'll record it.
Get us all home faster.

01:59.820 --> 02:00.886
I hear you.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.557
Hey, Shel. Yeah, I know.

02:05.559 --> 02:09.528
The girls didn't watch,
though, did they?

02:09.530 --> 02:11.530
Shel...

02:11.532 --> 02:13.599
No, I'm okay.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.200
But it's gonna be a while.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.769
(trilling, hydraulic whirring)

02:25.646 --> 02:27.679
Look, I know the last thing
you want to do

02:27.681 --> 02:29.581
is talk about what happened.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.550
I'm good.
Let's cut to the chase.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.618
You ended it.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.720
You did your job.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.821
I'm not here to discuss
the use of lethal force.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.925
Clearly, the suspect... sorry,
subject,

02:39.927 --> 02:42.261
had shown the intent to kill.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.363
I just need to hear

02:44.364 --> 02:46.464
and assess the details
and deliver my report.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.734
Well, it's all right there
in the transcripts.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.170
What else do you need to know?

02:51.172 --> 02:52.938
We entered the building,
then we contained,

02:52.940 --> 02:55.240
isolated and neutralized
the threat.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.675
Are you comfortable
with that language?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.644
What do you mean?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.512
Well, you don't want
to see blasÃ©.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.580
"Neutralize the threat."

03:01.582 --> 03:02.848
What you really mean is...

03:02.850 --> 03:04.750
Kill someone.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.552
What's your point?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.555
Does thinking in those terms
help get the job done?

03:09.557 --> 03:12.958
JULES:
Not at all.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.727
It's never easy to take a life.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.631
Even when that life is what
saves a number of others.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.767
Which, of course,
you did tonight.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.402
That's right.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.503
What was the final count?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.571
SPIKE:
<i> The number shot?</i>

03:25.573 --> 03:27.239
Ten dead, two wounded.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.240
Ten dead.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.641
That include the shooter,

03:29.643 --> 03:31.877
the one your
team killed?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.646
(people screaming)

03:34.648 --> 03:37.482
(sirens wailing)

03:41.956 --> 03:44.656
Say, buddy, talk to me, okay?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.458
How many casualties?
Got five.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.527
Five dead so far.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.595
Please, my husband,
he's still in there! Please!

03:50.598 --> 03:52.598
Can we get a paramedic
over here?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.932
Please!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.669
How long since
the last shot was fired?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.371
Four-four minutes ago.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.706
You get a look at the shooter?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.341
No, I was patrolling
the hallway.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.309
<i> I didn't see anything</i>
<i> out of place,</i>

04:04.311 --> 04:07.746
<i> and everything looked</i>
<i> as it should be.</i>

04:12.653 --> 04:14.586
(gunshot)

04:14.588 --> 04:16.822
WOMAN:
Angela!

04:16.824 --> 04:19.791
Angela!

04:19.793 --> 04:20.859
Angela!

04:20.861 --> 04:23.795
(four gunshots,
people screaming)

04:24.999 --> 04:26.732
Angela!

04:26.734 --> 04:30.669
GUARD:
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me, guys.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.803
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.438
(screams)
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.706
You need to come
with me, ma'am.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.441
She's dead.
We've got to get out of here.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.810
(woman sobbing)

04:40.814 --> 04:42.914
Do you have any idea
how many people are left inside?

04:42.916 --> 04:45.050
200. May... maybe 250.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.853
Eddie, Eddie,
seven shots fired.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.821
Hasn't gone to ground.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.657
Looks like a spree.
Random shooting pattern,

04:51.659 --> 04:53.725
high kill ratio.
What kind of event was this?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.694
A company party
for Brenton, Inc.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.662
PARKER: Could be a workplace
issue, disgruntled employee.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.564
(clamoring, sirens wailing)

04:59.566 --> 05:00.632
I'll get started.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.767
All right.
Spike, get some

05:01.769 --> 05:03.402
floor plans
for this gentlemen.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.037
We need to track this.
Let's go.
Let's go!

05:05.039 --> 05:08.373
Let's lock those exits down!
Do it now!

05:08.375 --> 05:10.742
Let's set up
a triage area nearby.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.685
Guys, direct to threat.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.688
We contain, isolate
and neutralize.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.890
Priority is speed.

05:24.892 --> 05:28.860
There were already five
dead when you arrived?

05:28.862 --> 05:31.330
Things happen fast
in spree killings.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.899
That's why ending things fast
is so important.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.534
37 minutes.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.337
37 minutes to arrive,
contain and neutralize, yeah.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.672
You're the tactician, right?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.840
I'm the team leader,

05:41.842 --> 05:43.508
but Greg Parker's
the sergeant.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.411
So you're saying the
37 minutes had more
to do with him?

05:46.413 --> 05:48.580
He'd seen this kind
of shooting before,

05:48.582 --> 05:50.515
and he brought that experience
to the table.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.352
I'm aware of your sergeant's
background.

05:53.354 --> 05:54.853
That's right,
you used to be a cop.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.455
And now I protect them.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.923
It's why I joined SIU.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.725
You've got quite the reputation.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.661
The killing spree at Cornwall
took nine minutes to contain.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.963
Chesapeake High took 13.
The big question

06:04.965 --> 06:07.966
the media are going to ask
is why did this one take 37?

06:07.968 --> 06:09.701
Those were different
circumstances.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.938
We had a lot more square footage
to cover.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.539
And while you were covering it,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.708
the subject was able
to shoot six more people.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.943
How do I explain that?

06:17.945 --> 06:19.611
Well, if you want
to protect cops,

06:19.613 --> 06:21.880
you suggest to the media
to forget the 37 minutes

06:21.882 --> 06:24.683
and focus instead
on the lives we saved.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.985
Fair enough.
Let's talk about

06:26.987 --> 06:29.087
saved lives.
Good, let's do that.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.890
Would you have been able to save
more lives and end the incident

06:31.892 --> 06:33.959
more quickly if you hadn't
allowed Sergeant Parker

06:33.961 --> 06:35.160
to override you?

06:36.930 --> 06:39.631
Boss, I need Spike out of the
truck and in the building.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.966
No, he's serving a purpose
in the truck, Ed.

06:40.968 --> 06:41.933
Boss, I need the hands here.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.402
We could use the intel more.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.870
More than quicker containment?

06:44.872 --> 06:46.705
Eddie, a building like this,
without intel, we're blind.

06:46.707 --> 06:47.739
We're running around in circles.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.143
Not a fan of circles.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.985
Guys, this is a spree
shooting...

06:59.987 --> 07:02.120
Just prepare for it.

07:04.091 --> 07:08.026
What did Sergeant Parker
mean, "prepare for it"?

07:11.799 --> 07:13.465
Sam?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.634
You were there,
you saw it.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.136
Sorry, it's hard
to wash all the blood off.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.738
I won't keep you long.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.873
And try hydrogen peroxide,
it helps.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.944
A shooting spree isn't like a
hostage crisis or a bomb scare.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.947
Even if you do everything right,
there's gonna be a death count.

07:28.949 --> 07:29.881
Bodies.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.817
Yes.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.085
You spent time in
Afghanistan, right?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.488
Yes. Two tours.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.990
Did that experience dull
your sensitivity?

07:40.561 --> 07:43.028
I don't have PTSD
and I do value human life,

07:43.030 --> 07:44.947
if that's what you're asking.

07:44.948 --> 07:46.865
I just meant did the experience
maybe make it easier.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.001
Made death familiar, not easy.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.771
But because the boss warned us,

07:52.773 --> 07:54.239
we were prepared for the bodies.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.776
Was there something you weren't
prepared for?

08:00.848 --> 08:03.982
Guess I wasn't expecting
the shoes.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.861
Easier to run without them.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.041
No.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.776
Two more.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.585
Gone.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.154
Here, too.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.860
ED:
Here's the other two.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.531
This is ground zero;
the first five victims.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.068
Not a lot of
stray bullet holes.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.970
The shooter knows guns.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.872
They were heading west.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.541
Away from the exits.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.942
The shooter was probably
following them,

09:03.944 --> 09:05.143
driving them further
into the building.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.012
All right, let's move.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.880
Spike, main atrium clear.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.115
We're heading west.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.950
Got it. Boss,
I'm gonna send in uniforms

09:11.952 --> 09:13.785
and EMT to follow up,
recover the bodies.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.321
Copy that, Spike, but only
the areas we've cleared.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.658
Remember,
any other details, sir?

09:19.660 --> 09:20.825
I don't know.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.694
It happened really fast.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.963
I was talking to an investor.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.631
(gunshots)
WOMAN:
Angela!

09:26.633 --> 09:29.000
(gunshots, panicked screaming)

09:29.002 --> 09:30.268
(screaming)

09:30.270 --> 09:32.671
Angela!

09:35.842 --> 09:37.208
Angela!

09:38.111 --> 09:39.978
Thank you very much.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.180
Okay, team, we're getting
conflicting stories

09:42.182 --> 09:44.015
from all the witnesses,

09:44.017 --> 09:45.817
but none of them mention
overlapping gunfire,

09:45.819 --> 09:48.720
so the shots all came
from one location.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.989
One gun, lone shooter--
fits a spree profile.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.591
We got a description?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.159
Nah, no one really got
a good look.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.794
Any of the witnesses
have guesses

09:55.796 --> 09:57.028
about who they pissed off?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.664
Brenton, Inc. is a multinational
conglomerate.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.866
People love to hate
multinational conglomerates.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.804
Our number of potentially
disgruntled just got bigger.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.306
Eddie, how you guys doing?
You doing okay?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.175
Yeah.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.110
Just please be careful.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.012
Always.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.915
Spike?
No eyes yet, but
this should help.
The guard said

10:16.917 --> 10:19.117
certain areas of the building
were closed off for the party.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.919
I can confirm none of these
locks have been breached.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.787
That's good.
Narrows our search by half.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.856
Eddie, the west side
of the building is clear.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.057
Just keep heading north.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.235
SAM:
Three o'clock.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.171
Drop the weapon!
Hands up now!

10:40.173 --> 10:41.072
Let's go! Let's go!

10:41.074 --> 10:42.173
Don't shoot!
Slowly!

10:42.175 --> 10:43.692
We don't have any weapons, okay?

10:43.693 --> 10:45.210
There are no guns.
Jim and I work for Brenton.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.078
These are our wives.

10:47.080 --> 10:47.912
Anybody see the shooter?

10:47.914 --> 10:48.980
No.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.982
<i> We were at the bar.</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:52.117
(gunshots)
<i> We heard some shots.</i>

10:52.119 --> 10:54.753
(gunshots, panicked screaming)

10:54.755 --> 10:56.688
<i> And then we just ran.</i>
<i> We wanted to get out of there.</i>

10:57.758 --> 10:59.224
What do we got?
What do we got?

10:59.226 --> 11:00.258
They're clean.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.977
JULES:
All right, let's go.

11:01.978 --> 11:03.695
He ran up those stairs.
You saw him?

11:03.697 --> 11:05.930
I heard him.
Every one else was running.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.899
He was the only one walking.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.167
JULES:
Just wait here
for a police officer.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.619
Spike, Asian Gallery's secure.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.070
We have four people coming out
and they need an escort.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.872
Copy that.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.020
JULES:
Avian Gallery clear.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.855
SAM:
Our shooter's been quiet.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.424
Means he's done, dead
or reloading.

11:32.426 --> 11:34.192
(two gunshots)
ED:
Let's hope for done.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.093
Ed!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.261
ED:
Shots fired!

11:36.263 --> 11:37.729
Shots fired!

11:39.232 --> 11:41.099
(panicked screaming)

11:41.101 --> 11:43.268
Stop right now!
Stay right there!

11:43.270 --> 11:44.936
(panicked shouting)

11:44.938 --> 11:47.138
Stop! Stop!

11:47.140 --> 11:49.708
Wordy, contain these people!
Get them out of here now!
Move! Move!

11:49.710 --> 11:51.076
Let's go, folks! Now!

11:51.078 --> 11:53.095
Quickly! Please! Let's go!

11:53.096 --> 11:55.113
Come on! Come on!
Quickly, please! Let's go!

11:55.115 --> 11:57.048
(gunshot)
Shooter 12 o'clock!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.917
Go, go, go!
Move that way now! Go!

11:58.919 --> 12:01.352
Keep going!

12:02.489 --> 12:04.322
Wait. This was

12:04.324 --> 12:05.323
eight minutes in.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.357
Eight minutes since

12:06.359 --> 12:07.358
you entered the building

12:07.360 --> 12:08.993
and Ed Lane told you to stay.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.295
Yep.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.030
Or was it Sergeant Parker?

12:12.032 --> 12:14.766
Ed. We needed
the crowd contained.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.334
This is all in the transcript.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.838
Does your team leader
have confidence in you?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.172
What do you mean?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.341
Pursue an active shooter

12:23.343 --> 12:24.976
or babysit witnesses.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.379
Ed Lane left you behind.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.781
Those witnesses were putting
themselves and us in danger.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.249
They needed to be evacuated.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.817
Okay, I get it.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.252
It was important
to keep them safe,

12:34.254 --> 12:36.054
so put a trusted officer on it.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.822
What is this,

12:37.824 --> 12:40.191
some solo version
of good cop/bad cop?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.493
(chuckles softly)

12:41.495 --> 12:42.894
Sorry.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.229
Old habit from the force.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.264
Okay. Well, it's confusing.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.332
You would've
just made

12:47.334 --> 12:50.235
my old partner Brian very happy.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.504
He thought it would trip up
the bad guys

12:52.506 --> 12:53.538
if we sort of

12:53.540 --> 12:56.207
switched sides
mid-interrogation.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.176
I guess I still do it.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.846
It's hard losing a partner.

13:01.848 --> 13:04.082
What?

13:04.084 --> 13:07.852
You said it "would've" made him
happy, not "it will."

13:09.456 --> 13:13.958
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

13:16.263 --> 13:20.231
So what happened next,
was that a mistake?

13:21.935 --> 13:25.837
ED:
Police! Police!

13:25.839 --> 13:27.572
Right there!
SAM: Police! Stop right there!

13:27.574 --> 13:29.340
(all yelling)
Drop the weapon!

13:29.342 --> 13:31.843
It's not me!
On the ground!
Drop it now!

13:31.845 --> 13:33.278
It's not me! It's not me!
On the ground now!

13:33.280 --> 13:34.546
Stay down! Stay down!

13:35.816 --> 13:37.115
(groans)

13:37.117 --> 13:38.283
He's clean.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.317
Boss, subject secure.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.251
(two gunshots)

13:40.253 --> 13:42.954
Eddie?

13:42.956 --> 13:44.189
Correction.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.125
Subject still at large.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.895
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

14:23.296 --> 14:26.030
WORDY:
Civilians secure.
En route to the exit.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.632
INVESTIGATOR:
<i> So you apprehended</i>
<i> the wrong suspect?</i>

14:27.634 --> 14:30.368
It turned out the man in the tux
was a Brenton guest.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.004
With a legally owned handgun.
The CEO's bodyguard.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.572
Our choices were appropriate
to the situation.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.407
Taking down a man pursuing
the shooter?

14:36.409 --> 14:39.477
A man discharging his gun in an
already volatile situation.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.145
Okay, here's the problem.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.547
The public are in shock

14:42.548 --> 14:43.948
and they're gonna want
somebody to blame.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.917
This is how
it's gonna spin:

14:45.919 --> 14:48.419
your decision to pursue
an innocent man wasted time

14:48.421 --> 14:50.388
and allowed the shooter's
rampage to continue.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.956
That's not what happened.
Won't matter.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.292
Make it matter. It's your job.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.563
Look, you're smart, I'm smart.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.497
We can sit here and we can twist
the words all day long.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.400
What is it that you really
want to hear?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.401
The truth.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.004
Makes two of us.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.407
My job is to keep the public
informed

15:09.409 --> 15:11.276
and the police service
accountable.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.610
Was the incident
mishandled,

15:12.612 --> 15:15.046
and if so whose
fault was it?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.447
No, it was not mishandled.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.449
You have the transcripts.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.286
Is there anything else
that I can help you with?

15:21.288 --> 15:22.921
I'm good.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.294
What was Greg Parker's state
of mind today?

15:29.296 --> 15:30.896
Excuse me?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.497
You'd know best.
You're second negotiator.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.532
In your opinion,

15:34.534 --> 15:37.669
does he bring his personal bias
to the negotiations?

15:37.671 --> 15:40.471
All negotiators rely
on personal bias. We're human.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.074
We can't erase life experience.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.143
So, you incorporate it?
To an extent.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.679
What does this have to do with
the investigation?

15:47.681 --> 15:51.049
Did Greg Parker's judgment today
prolong the rampage?

15:51.051 --> 15:53.318
No.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.621
Spike, I.D.'s on the deceased?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.323
The witnesses helped
identify them.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.358
I'm looking for connections
in case this isn't random.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.027
Anything?
One so far:

16:02.028 --> 16:03.695
they all worked for Brenton's
pharmaceutical arm.

16:03.697 --> 16:04.529
That's something.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.264
But none of them worked

16:06.266 --> 16:07.298
in the same division.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.599
All right,
try matching the names

16:08.601 --> 16:10.668
through executive boards
and action committees.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.404
If you're right, our shooter
needs a motive.
Copy.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.384
SAM:
I got it.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.223
JULES:
Sam?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.465
This was
13 minutes after

16:40.467 --> 16:42.500
Team One entered
the building?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.669
Yeah, that sounds about right.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.308
You want to tell me
what happened?

16:50.310 --> 16:53.144
Why did Jules Callaghan
step in

16:53.146 --> 16:55.446
after you said,
"I got it"?

16:55.448 --> 16:59.484
If there's a problem,
if this is too much for you...

16:59.486 --> 17:01.719
maybe you should consider
being put on leave?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.354
It wasn't the incident
that was it.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.289
Then what was it?

17:05.291 --> 17:08.659
Most people don't understand
why anyone would choose

17:08.661 --> 17:11.262
to put their life
on the line for strangers.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.231
It's a good question.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.400
I grew up in a military family

17:15.402 --> 17:18.269
and as a kid,
I didn't get it either, but...

17:18.271 --> 17:19.804
one day when I was nine,

17:19.806 --> 17:22.540
I was taking my little sister
to the park.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.308
We stopped at a crosswalk,

17:24.310 --> 17:26.677
and this car jumped the curb
and hit her.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.346
Sent her flying and...

17:28.348 --> 17:32.050
I remember looking over at her
laying there and thinking,

17:32.052 --> 17:34.318
"Why is she barefoot?"

17:34.320 --> 17:37.522
Then I looked down beside me,
and there were her sandals.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.758
She'd been knocked
right out of them.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.629
She died?

17:50.570 --> 17:54.372
Some people are helpless
and need to be protected.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.579
Yes, they do.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.550
So you joined up
like your dad.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.719
Yeah, like my dad.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.456
But today, for that one second,

18:11.458 --> 18:15.159
it just came back
to my little sister.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.695
'Cause this woman
in the museum was...

18:17.697 --> 18:20.364
she was barefoot.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.840
I got a pulse.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.609
EMS, Dinosaur Gallery.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.151
Guys, I think
I have something here.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.620
Spike, I'm gonna
send this to you.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.491
Boss?

18:47.827 --> 18:50.862
(low, indistinct conversations)

18:52.832 --> 18:54.899
(gunshots, panicked screaming)

18:58.505 --> 19:00.505
(gunshot)

19:02.775 --> 19:04.542
(computer beeps)

19:04.544 --> 19:06.611
(panicked screaming)

19:09.449 --> 19:11.332
SPIKE:
The shooter's a woman.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.216
I'll run her face through
Brenton's personnel system.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.353
Put it through the license
database, too, females
between 30 and 40.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.655
Let's keep our options open.
She may not be an employee.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.656
Copy.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.391
(computer beeping)

19:20.393 --> 19:21.926
You're going to be okay.

19:21.928 --> 19:22.927
Just hang in there.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.562
OFFICER:
We got EMS!

19:27.634 --> 19:29.700
(woman groans)

19:29.702 --> 19:30.835
What's your name, ma'am?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.737
(moans)

19:34.307 --> 19:35.540
Spike, we got eyes yet?

19:35.542 --> 19:36.641
SPIKE:
Sort of.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.675
The motion detectors
are working,

19:37.677 --> 19:39.377
but not all
the CCTV cameras

19:39.379 --> 19:40.678
are operational.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.846
So some of the cameras
have blind spots?

19:41.848 --> 19:42.847
Yep.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.516
Like the room you're in now.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.488
It's been shot out.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.423
Oh, that would do it.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.725
Boss, we're splitting
into Alpha and Bravo.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.726
What's your plan, Eddie?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.395
We got to get ahead of her.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.696
If she's shooting out cameras
as she goes,

19:58.698 --> 19:59.948
we can track
where she's been.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.199
And maybe predict
where she's going.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.567
ED:
Yeah, but we got
to get ahead of her.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.702
Back her into a corner.
Copy that.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.504
Eddie, you and Wordy
are Alpha?

20:06.506 --> 20:07.922
We're heading east.

20:07.923 --> 20:09.339
Sam and Jules,
you're Bravo Team heading west.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.575
Okay, everybody, I need you

20:10.577 --> 20:12.476
to locate the motion
detectors above the art

20:12.478 --> 20:14.278
and manually re-direct
them outwards.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.414
Like an electronic
perimeter.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.916
Spike can monitor movement
where we don't have eyes.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.375
Boss?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.743
I've matched the shooter's
face from the cell footage

20:45.745 --> 20:47.578
with photos from the
driver's license database.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.646
Who is she?

20:48.648 --> 20:50.965
Claire Williams.

20:50.966 --> 20:53.283
No criminal record,
and not an employee of Brenton.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.452
It's not a workplace grudge.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.586
Looking.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.071
Everything you can find.

20:57.072 --> 20:58.555
Track down family, see
if they can tell us anything.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.657
(gunshot)

20:59.659 --> 21:00.758
Eddie? Status!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
We're right behind her.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.500
Don't shoot!

21:09.502 --> 21:10.001
Where's the shooter?

21:10.003 --> 21:11.336
Don't shoot!

21:11.337 --> 21:12.670
I'm not going
to shoot you, sir.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.871
The woman with the gun.

21:13.873 --> 21:14.872
Can you tell me
where she went?

21:14.874 --> 21:16.340
I don't know.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.541
She shot Kevin.

21:17.543 --> 21:18.676
Okay.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.344
Is this your coworker?

21:20.346 --> 21:23.447
Yeah. She just shot him.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.683
I knew I was going to die.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.917
She was going to
shoot me, too.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.020
I-I-I closed my
eyes, but...

21:29.022 --> 21:31.289
nothing happened,
and I opened my eyes,

21:31.291 --> 21:32.456
and she was gone.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.758
Did you know her?

21:33.760 --> 21:36.427
No. I-I'd never
seen her before.

21:36.429 --> 21:39.063
Wait.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.666
Do you know why
she didn't shoot me, too?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.403
She's choosing her victims.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.405
Team One, new deal.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.906
This isn't a spree shooting.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.710
This is personal.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.817
Okay, we've got fresh eyes
on this, team.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.319
These victims are not random.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.521
This is personal.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.722
INVESTIGATOR:
<i> Anyone ever accuse</i>
<i> your team of bad profiling?</i>

22:05.725 --> 22:07.658
No.
You went in

22:07.660 --> 22:09.343
hunting a male
disgruntled employee

22:09.344 --> 22:11.027
randomly shooting people when
you should have been looking

22:11.030 --> 22:12.563
for a woman on a mission.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.366
Statistics and experience
suggest a male shooter.

22:15.368 --> 22:16.834
Now, the profile evolved.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.903
We changed our thinking,
and we found her.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.571
After 37 minutes.

22:20.573 --> 22:21.839
After 37 minutes.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.574
And this evolving profile--

22:23.576 --> 22:25.343
did it add pressure
to the situation?

22:25.345 --> 22:26.610
Time was against you.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.845
Were you feeling
stressed or...?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.046
Or annoyed?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.681
Yes.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.750
Were you feeling annoyed?
Off your game?

22:32.752 --> 22:33.851
No.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.353
I was doing my job.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.354
We all were.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.621
It's natural to feel frustrated.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.740
We had new information--

22:39.741 --> 22:41.858
from our search, from the
sister, from what Spike found.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.761
Now, adjusting profiles

22:43.763 --> 22:45.096
as we go is part of the job,

22:45.098 --> 22:47.098
just like reading transcripts
is part of yours.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.566
Let me ask you this.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.034
Do typos annoy you?
Do they frustrate you?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.036
Do they compromise your, uh,

22:52.038 --> 22:54.071
your game?

22:54.073 --> 22:56.874
So, if your analogy fits,
you were annoyed.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.876
I am now.
You got an actual question?

22:58.878 --> 23:01.112
I do. What did you do
with the new information?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.549
Anything line up
between the shooter

23:05.551 --> 23:06.884
and the names of the deceased?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.920
PARKER:
Spike's still looking through

23:08.921 --> 23:10.955
court records and police
reports-- anything he can find.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.858
He says her sister's here,
so I'm gonna see what she knows.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.493
Rachel?

23:15.495 --> 23:16.927
Hi. I'm Sergeant Parker.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.796
Thanks for coming.
Please, have a seat.

23:18.798 --> 23:21.732
Do you have any idea why
your sister would do this?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.401
Claire's been through
a nightmare.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.803
Her husband Tom had been
in the hospital for months.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.872
It was horrible.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.440
Then last week, Claire...

23:29.442 --> 23:31.041
she had to take him
off life support.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.511
He lasted for a couple of hours,
but he didn't make it.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.945
Claire's not

23:34.947 --> 23:37.648
a very outgoing person.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.150
Tom was her whole world.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.985
She kind of fell apart.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.421
What's the connection
to this company, to Brenton?

23:43.423 --> 23:45.990
Tom had been on Neptysol,
a drug made by Brenton.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.825
An ingredient in it killed him.

23:47.827 --> 23:48.859
And that was proven?

23:48.861 --> 23:50.461
He had a rare reaction

23:50.463 --> 23:51.829
to a binding chemical.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.481
Rare enough to be considered

23:53.482 --> 23:55.132
what the fine print calls
an "acceptable risk."

23:55.134 --> 23:56.901
And Claire disagreed?
Yeah.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.202
Claire disagreed.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.137
MAN:
Please, Mrs. Williams.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.608
Claire, I need you
to reconsider our offer.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.510
Ben, I think you should leave.

24:06.512 --> 24:07.812
I'm sorry, Claire.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.146
I am so sorry
for your loss.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.148
And I know that nothing
I say is gonna make that

24:11.150 --> 24:12.750
hurt any less, but
not taking the money

24:12.752 --> 24:13.984
is not gonna
bring your husband back.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.052
I don't want your money.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.587
I want your company

24:16.589 --> 24:17.955
to change their product.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.457
Well, I'm afraid
that is not gonna happen.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.859
Well, then we have a problem.
Reformulating

24:21.861 --> 24:23.994
Neptysol, that would take years
of retesting and research.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.796
Yes.
Now, during that
time, we would have

24:25.798 --> 24:26.997
to pull it off the market.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.166
(chuckles)
Now, I know this
is a sad time,

24:29.168 --> 24:31.101
but I just want you to look

24:31.103 --> 24:32.236
at the big picture.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.904
Neptysol is a
miracle pill

24:33.906 --> 24:36.173
for millions of people
worldwide. Millions.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.575
Now, the binding ingredient

24:37.576 --> 24:38.976
that your husband had
a negative reaction...

24:38.978 --> 24:41.011
Negative? Negative?!

24:41.013 --> 24:42.780
As in death?

24:42.782 --> 24:43.914
That occurs in less
than point-zero-zero...

24:43.916 --> 24:46.116
We're not numbers.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.952
Your product killed my husband,

24:47.954 --> 24:50.254
and other people's
loved ones as well.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.990
That is what
this lawsuit is about.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.527
Stopping... stopping
innocent people from dying.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.562
Claire, the lawsuit is
why I'm here, officially.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.998
Now, your lawyer's gonna
call you this afternoon,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.633
but I felt after all
the meetings with the company

25:02.635 --> 25:04.168
I'd give you
a face-to-face
explanation.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.070
But there is not going
to be a lawsuit.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.940
All the rest of the families
have agreed to take the money.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.247
Now, I'm sorry,
but that's why

25:16.249 --> 25:18.549
I think you need
to take our offer.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.017
I'll fight it myself.
Brenton can

25:20.019 --> 25:21.118
afford this dispute.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.786
The only question
is whether

25:22.788 --> 25:24.054
you want to face that fact

25:24.056 --> 25:25.022
with or without
compensation.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.224
(dishes shattering)

25:38.004 --> 25:40.237
(quiet sob)

25:41.674 --> 25:43.040
When she stopped,

25:43.042 --> 25:45.776
I asked Ben how much
they were offering.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.211
Claire just stormed out.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.913
It was four days ago.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.848
I haven't seen her since.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.316
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.919
If I have any more
questions, I'll call.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.587
Thank you.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.556
Find who's named
on Claire's lawsuit.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.991
If the names match up
with our deceased...

26:00.993 --> 26:03.193
We'll know the
remaining targets.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.229
(alarm blaring)
ED:
Boss, she set a fire.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.697
WORDY:
We must be closing in.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.132
Guys, there's gonna be
an automatic lockdown.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.167
Wordy, go, go, go!

26:10.169 --> 26:11.902
Damn it!

26:11.904 --> 26:14.071
Wordy,

26:14.073 --> 26:15.072
get the fire.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.073
Spike, override
this lockdown now.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.308
She's buying time.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.010
I'm trying, but they
just renovated the museum.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.245
I don't care!

26:21.247 --> 26:23.314
Oh, you do.
The security system's upgraded.

26:23.316 --> 26:24.748
Spike, do it now!

26:24.750 --> 26:27.017
I haven't dealt
with a 2700 before.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.652
At which point

26:28.654 --> 26:30.988
your team leader responded
with some colorful language.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.023
Ed says what thinks.
Profanity

26:33.025 --> 26:35.259
is an expression
of loss of control.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.660
Not very reassuring

26:36.662 --> 26:37.928
for a team leader.

26:37.930 --> 26:38.996
He didn't lose control.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.598
He didn't make it harder for you

26:40.600 --> 26:41.599
to think clearly under pressure?

26:41.601 --> 26:42.933
No, he didn't.

26:42.935 --> 26:43.867
Are you sure?

26:43.869 --> 26:45.669
Active shooter,

26:45.671 --> 26:47.137
direct to threat
imperative,

26:47.139 --> 26:49.273
and you cost your team
valuable seconds

26:49.275 --> 26:51.141
trying to open a door.

26:51.143 --> 26:53.110
That wasn't 'cause of Ed;

26:53.112 --> 26:55.846
that was because I didn't
know this particular system.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.065
Doesn't your team
count on you

26:58.066 --> 27:00.283
to be familiar with
all the advances in
security technology?

27:00.286 --> 27:03.320
I am-- I stay on top
of every release,
but the 2700...

27:03.322 --> 27:06.223
The bereaved don't want
to hear about the 2700.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.259
They want to know whether
charges of criminal negligence

27:09.261 --> 27:12.229
should be brought
against the leaders of
your team for the deaths

27:12.231 --> 27:14.115
that occurred
after your arrival.

27:14.116 --> 27:16.000
When I was unable to override
the security system

27:16.002 --> 27:18.936
and unlock the door,
Ed took care of it.

27:18.938 --> 27:19.937
When you failed.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.939
When I failed, Ed succeeded.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.774
The team succeeded.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.976
We all have our roles,

27:25.978 --> 27:28.012
our strengths
and our weaknesses.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.647
We work together.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.348
We're not a bunch of guys;

27:31.350 --> 27:33.083
we're a unit.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.284
ED:
Spike,

27:34.286 --> 27:37.121
(alarm blaring)
I'm taking over.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.992
(beeping)
Get down.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.996
(beeping continues)

27:45.998 --> 27:47.164
(loud explosion)

27:47.166 --> 27:49.967
We're in.
Let's go, let's go!

27:49.969 --> 27:52.036
(alarm continues blaring)

27:53.272 --> 27:54.905
Okay, let's stop here.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.140
Excuse me?

27:56.141 --> 27:57.374
I know what happens next--
I'm more interested

27:57.376 --> 27:58.809
in your state of mind
at this mind.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.110
What do you mean,
my state of mind?

28:00.112 --> 28:01.412
Your adrenaline's
pumping,

28:01.413 --> 28:02.713
the frustration
of the locked door,

28:02.715 --> 28:03.714
loss of time.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.049
Were you more
or less likely

28:05.051 --> 28:06.750
to use lethal force?
Hold on a second.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.218
Are we debating
lethal force here?

28:08.220 --> 28:10.087
Really? Is that we're doing?
Because this was textbook.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.222
We both know real life
doesn't do textbook.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.124
Active shooter,
currently shooting people.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.126
We neutralize
the threat before

28:16.128 --> 28:17.828
the subject can
take down more victims.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.329
That's what your team
failed to do.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.964
It took you 37 minutes

28:20.966 --> 28:22.066
to neutralize
the threat,

28:22.068 --> 28:23.300
and she took more lives.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.902
It is a judgment call.

28:24.904 --> 28:25.969
Whose judgment?

28:25.971 --> 28:27.137
Your direct to
threat, right?

28:27.139 --> 28:28.238
Let's get the job done?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.240
Who got hung up on profiling?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.142
Who put a team member
in a truck instead of

28:32.144 --> 28:34.144
another gun at
ground zero?
You are off base.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.468
Greg Parker.

28:35.469 --> 28:36.791
My team did
everything right...

28:36.792 --> 28:38.114
This isn't about your
team, Officer Lane.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.316
Everything
right today.
This is about

28:39.318 --> 28:40.484
whether or not
My team-- excuse me.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.252
Greg Parker is fit
My team did

28:42.254 --> 28:44.288
everything right today.
to remain with this unit.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.255
Are we done here?

28:45.257 --> 28:46.890
Yeah, we're done.
Thank you.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.406
Where's Parker?

29:02.408 --> 29:04.208
Sequestered.
You can't go down there.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.275
What?

29:07.213 --> 29:09.446
That's what I thought.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.953
She's gunning for you.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.521
What are you doing here, Eddie?
Get out of here.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.022
She's out for blood,
specifically yours.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.024
I didn't do anything.

29:21.026 --> 29:23.494
But right now you talking to me
doesn't look good on paper.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.896
I don't care.
Something's wrong here.
I care.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.798
I care. We need
to keep our T's crossed, okay?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.116
Just get out of here.

29:29.117 --> 29:30.433
Greg, is there something
I should know?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.369
Just go.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.273
Let's compare lists, every
name on Claire's lawsuit--

29:36.275 --> 29:39.042
who's dead, who's safe outside
and who's still missing inside.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.878
I need updates, Bravo Team.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.212
Perimeter's sealed.
All stairways secured.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.148
No movement possible in or out.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.250
That's good.
Alpha Team, what's your status?

29:46.252 --> 29:48.118
East is still locked down.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.353
Wordy and I have
worked up from the south.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.354
Okay, that's good.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.522
Keep corralling Claire north.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.490
She's running out
of room to run now.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.528
What did you say?

29:57.530 --> 29:58.829
Jules, what
did you say?

29:58.831 --> 30:00.130
About what?
About the boss

30:00.132 --> 30:01.098
to SIU.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.166
I just...

30:02.168 --> 30:03.200
I just told her what happened,

30:03.202 --> 30:04.234
that's all.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.302
Same here.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.203
And what did happen?

30:06.205 --> 30:07.404
You were there.
Yeah, I was,

30:07.406 --> 30:08.505
but she's after something,

30:08.507 --> 30:10.340
and it's not just
the 37 minutes.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.542
She finds
a way to nail

30:11.544 --> 30:13.210
the boss, and he's
facing criminal charges.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.478
What for?

30:14.480 --> 30:15.479
Criminal charges?
We did everything

30:15.481 --> 30:16.814
by the book.
What's the problem?

30:16.816 --> 30:17.848
Are you sure?
Yeah.

30:17.850 --> 30:18.849
Aren't you?

30:18.851 --> 30:20.350
Think the boss
made a mistake?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.186
No.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.387
So what's going on?

30:23.389 --> 30:25.255
Well, she's after him.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.957
Why?
Well, that's what
we got to find out.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.859
I think it's personal.
Well, she was a cop--

30:28.861 --> 30:30.594
someone's got to know her--
we'll track down her partner.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.529
Have to track someone else down;
her partner Brian's dead.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.464
I could probably find a way
to access her files.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.401
Let's figure it out before
she finds a way to frame him.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.338
What is it?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.140
I didn't mean anything negative.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.208
What did you say?

30:44.210 --> 30:46.210
I said that by
his directive

30:46.212 --> 30:47.377
to corral Claire into a corner,

30:47.379 --> 30:48.979
we were also
corralling her targets.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.080
That's the only way
we were gonna

30:50.082 --> 30:51.181
save those people
and stop that shooter.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.349
I know that.
It was the only choice.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.834
It was a risk we had to take.

30:53.835 --> 30:55.318
Well, maybe the SIU
didn't agree.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.022
INVESTIGATOR:
<i> And how many lives constitute</i>

30:59.024 --> 31:01.225
an acceptable risk?

31:01.227 --> 31:03.594
Many factors need
to be considered.

31:03.596 --> 31:05.863
But there must be
some standard,

31:05.865 --> 31:08.398
some method to weighing
your options.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.234
Number risked
versus number saved?

31:10.236 --> 31:12.069
There's no arithmetic for this.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.404
In a perfect world,
no life would be sacrificed.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.875
But in your experience, that
doesn't happen much, does it?

31:18.444 --> 31:21.612
I don't work
in a perfect world, no.

31:21.614 --> 31:25.315
If we do lose a life,
it's only to save many more.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.289
Jill, how you been?

31:33.525 --> 31:36.126
You don't get to ask me that.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.364
ED:
Okay, guys, I want
to know everything here.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.432
She's been SIU
just under a year.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.435
Completed all the standard prep
classes: constitutional law,

31:45.437 --> 31:48.305
criminal code, Evidence Act,
Coroner's Act...
Her testimony's led

31:48.307 --> 31:50.107
to the conviction
of some bad apples.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.308
Her SIU record's solid.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.243
She was a cop
for seven years.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.145
Good performance reviews,
promotions.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.047
She rose through the ranks fast.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.683
She was a training officer
for guys applying to SIU.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.953
Okay, I admit she was good--
so why'd she leave the force?

32:02.955 --> 32:05.589
Maybe the same reason she took
a two-year personal leave

32:05.591 --> 32:07.925
and went traveling.
After her partner died.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.961
So what happened to Brian?

32:10.963 --> 32:12.462
Come on, Spike,
anything else?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.064
The Brenton people
Claire had meetings with

32:14.066 --> 32:15.315
the weeks before
her husband's death--

32:15.316 --> 32:16.565
three of them are
still in the building.

32:16.568 --> 32:17.567
Okay, I want phone numbers.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.136
Phone numbers from

32:19.137 --> 32:20.704
the company directory
coming at you.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.574
Let's find these three people
before Claire does.

32:24.576 --> 32:27.044
You get that one.
Yeah.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.145
There were three
targeted people

32:28.147 --> 32:29.246
still inside
the building.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.014
All three gave me
their location

32:31.016 --> 32:32.082
via text message.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.084
And?
We told them
to stay concealed

32:34.086 --> 32:36.053
and that we were
coming to get them.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.188
Removing the targets
to stop the killing.
That's right.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.490
We broke off into three teams
for the retrieval.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.992
Jules and Sam, Ed and Wordy,

32:41.994 --> 32:43.811
you and...
Spike.
And we knew

32:43.812 --> 32:45.629
that Claire would be
in one of these three places.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.002
WOMAN:
She's not here.

32:52.004 --> 32:55.539
Come out slowly, hands
where we can see them.

32:55.541 --> 32:56.740
What's your name?

32:56.742 --> 32:58.175
Nora. Nora Pullan.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.543
She's a target.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.044
All right, we need
a civilian escort.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.346
You're gonna be
just fine, ma'am.

33:02.348 --> 33:05.115
An officer will escort
you out of the building.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.550
SAM:
Okay, Bravo Team complete.

33:06.551 --> 33:07.984
Sam, you join up
with Ed and Wordy.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.219
Jules, you come find me.

33:36.281 --> 33:39.449
No. No.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.051
Scott Williams?

33:41.053 --> 33:42.119
No.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.156
SCOTT:
Please.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.025
You don't need to do this.

33:48.027 --> 33:51.294
I do. No one would
listen to me.

33:51.296 --> 33:52.796
Now maybe they will!

33:56.301 --> 33:58.135
I have a family.
So did I!

33:59.171 --> 34:02.205
PARKER:
Shots fired.
Northeast direction.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.252
(whispers):
Boss?

34:21.593 --> 34:22.826
No.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.062
Eddie, Text Two is down.

34:25.064 --> 34:26.730
We're headed your way.
You got the ball.

34:37.443 --> 34:40.610
CLAIRE:
Blood... in his lungs.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.379
He was literally drowning
ED: We got a visual
on the shooter.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.547
every time he took a breath.
Her gun is down.

34:43.549 --> 34:44.848
She's talking
with our Text Three.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.467
That's a good sign.
If Claire's

34:46.468 --> 34:48.085
talking to him,
maybe she'll talk to us.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.187
Sam, hold cover.
Wordy and I'll move in.

34:50.189 --> 34:53.256
PARKER:
Team One, do not engage
until I get there.

34:53.258 --> 34:56.793
Tell me again,
how much is a life worth?

34:56.795 --> 34:58.128
I-I don't know. I'll give you
as much as you want.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.430
(shouting):
Wrong answer!

35:00.432 --> 35:02.099
I don't...

35:02.101 --> 35:03.767
want...

35:03.769 --> 35:05.135
your money!

35:05.137 --> 35:06.203
She's escalating.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.437
I want you to pay!

35:07.439 --> 35:09.139
Don't hurt him!

35:09.141 --> 35:10.307
(yelling)

35:10.309 --> 35:12.642
You comfortable with that,
Sergeant Parker?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.211
Playing roulette
with other people's lives?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.879
I think we should take a minute.
We both need...

35:15.881 --> 35:17.614
You ever think about
how your belief

35:17.616 --> 35:18.782
in everyone's inner goodness

35:18.784 --> 35:20.567
actually puts more lives
at risk?

35:20.568 --> 35:22.351
If there's a chance to talk,
it's my duty to take it.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.520
You didn't let your team

35:23.522 --> 35:25.622
take Claire down
when you had the chance,

35:25.624 --> 35:27.491
and you lost control
of the situation.

35:27.493 --> 35:28.825
I used my best judgment,

35:28.827 --> 35:31.795
based on my instinct
and my experience in the field.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.430
I'm aware
of your experience, Greg,

35:33.432 --> 35:34.865
and your instincts.

35:34.867 --> 35:36.900
I know you are.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.808
Look, Jill, you can second-
guess me all you want.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.543
You can refer religiously
to those transcripts,

35:46.545 --> 35:48.478
but unless you were there
in the room,

35:48.480 --> 35:50.914
you can't know all
the moving parts

35:50.916 --> 35:52.449
of any situation.

35:52.451 --> 35:55.252
Claire lowered her gun
when the wife intervened.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.654
It's my job
to take that opportunity...

36:00.159 --> 36:01.858
Claire, thank you
for keeping your gun lowered.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.794
Now, if you could
just lay it down

36:04.796 --> 36:06.930
on the ground for me,
maybe we can work this out.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.899
I don't need any more lies.

36:08.901 --> 36:10.500
I'm not going
to lie to you, Claire.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.235
We both know

36:12.237 --> 36:14.171
what's already happened here
tonight,

36:14.173 --> 36:15.605
but it doesn't mean
it has to continue.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.708
It doesn't mean
it has to get worse.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.748
Get out of the way.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.448
No.

36:25.450 --> 36:26.383
Move!

36:27.186 --> 36:28.618
I said move!

36:30.889 --> 36:33.623
And then
the incident was resolved.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.891
After 37 minutes, in which

36:34.893 --> 36:36.960
you allowed your team
to put lives at risk.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.329
You know I didn't.
And I will make sure

36:39.331 --> 36:41.698
it never happens again.
What are you going to
charge me with, Jill?

36:41.700 --> 36:43.934
This investigation
isn't about today.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.936
It is. It's about your judgment.

36:45.938 --> 36:47.704
It's about your fitness
as leader.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.773
No, no.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.243
(beep)

36:53.245 --> 36:56.213
For you, this investigation
is about Brian.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.515
JULES:
<i> We found out</i>

36:58.517 --> 37:00.884
why Brian stopped
being Jill's partner.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.452
He made SRU.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.720
She trained him?

37:03.722 --> 37:04.988
Looks like it.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.224
Her name's all over his
performance reviews.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.626
SAM:
And his letter of
recommendation.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.661
You see the kicker?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.563
Brian was on the boss's team.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.473
JILL:
You put Brian at risk.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.709
In that spree shooting,
you hesitated.

37:25.711 --> 37:29.379
You gave that scumbag a chance
to kill Brian, and he took it.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.481
We did what we thought was right
in the circumstance.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.516
You believed the best
of that scumbag.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.585
You gambled with Brian's life.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.654
You put him at risk
unnecessarily

37:37.656 --> 37:39.990
just like you did today.
Jill.

37:39.992 --> 37:42.392
Jill, I know you're in pain.

37:42.394 --> 37:44.761
I know you want
to blame me.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.730
But I did not cause
Brian's death.

37:46.732 --> 37:48.431
You need to take responsibility.

37:48.433 --> 37:51.468
You put the lives
of your people in danger.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.602
I'll prove it.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.638
I'll prove
that you should be charged

37:54.640 --> 37:56.640
with criminal disregard
of human life

37:56.642 --> 37:57.974
and removed from duty.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.777
I can let you believe
what you believe.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.746
It's probably easier
to live with

38:02.748 --> 38:04.447
than knowing the truth.

38:04.449 --> 38:07.684
You came out of
that museum tonight

38:07.686 --> 38:09.686
after seeing...

38:09.688 --> 38:11.921
after seeing that tragedy.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.457
You came out, and you saw me,
and all that outrage

38:14.459 --> 38:15.892
and all that grief
came up again,

38:15.894 --> 38:18.695
and this was your chance to
right a wrong for his sake.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.063
I understand.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.798
But I got to tell
you something.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.933
The night you lost Brian...

38:23.935 --> 38:26.002
Hmm.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.005
The night<i> we</i> lost Brian...

38:29.007 --> 38:31.941
it's not what
you think.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.943
The time for negotiation
was over.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.813
I saw the signs, I called
Scorpio, like I did tonight.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.315
After Brian died.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.383
No, Jill.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.019
Before.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.757
Brian hesitated.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.028
What?

38:52.030 --> 38:54.331
Tonight when I called Scorpio,

38:54.333 --> 38:55.632
my shooter, Ed,
responded immediately.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.067
He took the shot.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.472
And Brian didn't?

39:02.474 --> 39:04.674
No.

39:05.644 --> 39:08.778
It was Brian who hesitated?

39:11.049 --> 39:14.384
(sighs)

39:14.386 --> 39:16.820
That's not what it said
in the report.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.822
Reports and
transcripts--

39:18.824 --> 39:21.424
they don't tell
the whole truth.

39:21.426 --> 39:24.661
Brian was a good man.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.897
I miss him, too.

39:27.899 --> 39:31.067
And that night, he
thought he could help.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.770
Turns out,
he couldn't.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.776
Sometimes we can't help.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.946
PARKER:
Claire, you don't
have to do this.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.548
Ben's wife has nothing to do
with Brenton. She's innocent.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.518
Like your husband
was innocent.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.490
Innocent.

39:54.826 --> 39:56.693
Innocent just means...

39:58.463 --> 40:00.730
...acceptable risk.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.498
Scorpio.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.829
Â¶ Â¶

41:01.493 --> 41:03.560
Â¶ Â¶

41:26.718 --> 41:28.785
We're done.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.658
SIU will find

41:35.660 --> 41:38.795
that Team One used
clear judgment and
appropriate force.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.499
I'm sorry that you all had
to go through this

41:42.501 --> 41:43.733
after a night like tonight.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.704
Thank you.

41:59.217 --> 42:02.652
We did all we could tonight.

42:05.557 --> 42:06.856
Hey,

42:06.858 --> 42:09.158
I'm proud of all of you.

42:13.565 --> 42:16.666
I'm damn proud to be
a member of this team.

42:23.642 --> 42:24.941
Yeah.
