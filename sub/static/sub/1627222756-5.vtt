We really love writing
for Princess,

51:22.880 --> 51:24.490
as well as our new character,
Mercer.

51:24.621 --> 51:26.144
There's such depths there

51:26.275 --> 51:29.452
that we just kind of
get to unpeel slowly.

51:29.582 --> 51:32.150
And for Princess,
we had this moment

51:32.281 --> 51:33.760
where they're being questioned

51:33.891 --> 51:36.981
and they they question her
about this $2 bill,

51:37.112 --> 51:39.070
and she starts
to tell this story.

51:39.201 --> 51:41.377
Essentially, like, it means
something personal to her.

51:41.507 --> 51:43.466
And at one point
in the interview,

51:43.596 --> 51:45.294
she turns to Mercer
and, like, looks

51:45.424 --> 51:46.556
at him standing there
and says..

51:46.686 --> 51:48.471
When we're done
with these questions,

51:48.601 --> 51:49.820
can I get my $2 back?

51:49.950 --> 51:51.430
When she gets it back,

51:51.561 --> 51:53.911
she just knows in her gut
that it was him,

51:54.041 --> 51:56.566
because they saw that
bin of money that was

51:56.696 --> 51:59.177
all marked for confiscation
on the way out.

51:59.308 --> 52:01.005
They know that that has to be,

52:01.136 --> 52:02.833
like, the way that
they deal with money.

52:02.963 --> 52:07.664
So she's thinking, like, maybe
he's not as scary of a guy

52:07.794 --> 52:11.581
as he seems when he's just,
you know, doing his job.

52:11.711 --> 52:12.973
And I think from Mercer's side,

52:13.104 --> 52:14.888
he sees something about her,

52:15.019 --> 52:17.326
that there's a sweetness there.

52:17.456 --> 52:21.547
And he sees that she sees him
in some ways.

52:21.678 --> 52:23.941
And I think that she sees

52:24.071 --> 52:26.073
that he sees something more
in her.

52:26.204 --> 52:29.120
And so in that moment
with the $2 bill, like,

52:29.251 --> 52:32.036
we wanted this chance to just

52:32.167 --> 52:35.344
start to break the ice more
between them.

52:35.474 --> 52:37.041
You have...

52:37.172 --> 52:38.782
really...

52:38.912 --> 52:41.306
beautiful eyelashes.

52:41.437 --> 52:43.961
So Maggie and Negan --

52:44.091 --> 52:46.529
they're the last two standing
of this group.

52:46.659 --> 52:49.445
So, they're just in this
really uncomfortable position

52:49.575 --> 52:52.796
where neither trusts
the other person,

52:52.926 --> 52:54.624
neither really even
likes the other person,

52:54.754 --> 52:56.495
although I would say that Negan

52:56.626 --> 52:59.063
has this kind of a respect
for Maggie.

52:59.194 --> 53:01.326
He doesn't trust her,

53:01.457 --> 53:02.806
but he does, like, respect

53:02.936 --> 53:04.416
the type of a leader
that she is.

53:04.547 --> 53:08.203
But at the same time,
Maggie just very grudgingly

53:08.333 --> 53:09.987
accepts that she needs him,

53:10.117 --> 53:11.858
but it's always uneasy
between them.

53:11.989 --> 53:13.730
They can't even decide
on whether to stay

53:13.860 --> 53:15.732
or go from this house.

53:15.862 --> 53:17.429
It works out
the way Maggie wants,

53:17.560 --> 53:19.039
but it doesn't mean that
Negan's wrong

53:19.170 --> 53:21.303
about everything
he's saying to her either.

53:21.433 --> 53:23.914
Maggie: Oh, my God.
You made it.

53:24.044 --> 53:26.438
Our people --
they're such a family,

53:26.569 --> 53:28.266
and so there are moments

53:28.397 --> 53:33.445
when they decide strategically,
we have to keep moving.

53:33.576 --> 53:36.013
But those are not decisions
that are made lightly.

53:36.143 --> 53:38.668
And I think in this case,
Gabriel feels like,

53:38.798 --> 53:40.974
well, we've gotten
to the safe house.

53:41.105 --> 53:43.150
We've only just
barely gotten here.

53:43.281 --> 53:45.283
Of course we wait,
because that was the plan.

53:45.414 --> 53:46.893
And so if that was not the plan,

53:47.024 --> 53:49.635
he probably also would have been
like, we have to move on.

53:49.766 --> 53:52.551
But Negan is very pragmatic
in his own way,

53:52.682 --> 53:54.205
but he's also kind of selfish.

53:54.336 --> 53:56.381
And I think that
that's kind of the fun of Negan.

53:56.512 --> 53:58.340
There's a lot of times
where Negan,

53:58.470 --> 54:00.298
if you're really talking
about self-preservation,

54:00.429 --> 54:02.518
his point of view makes
a lot of sense, you know,

54:02.648 --> 54:05.608
and it's not like
entirelyselfish.

54:05.738 --> 54:07.087
Like, he is saying,

54:07.218 --> 54:09.133
let's be really, really,
like, practical

54:09.264 --> 54:12.223
about what we can
realistically get done.

54:12.354 --> 54:14.138
Is this just a suicide mission
we're on?

54:14.269 --> 54:16.227
He has no desire to die.

54:16.358 --> 54:20.275
♪

54:20.405 --> 54:23.060
I think with Judith,
we really wanted to deal

54:23.190 --> 54:25.105
with the fact
that she's growing up,

54:25.236 --> 54:27.325
and she's growing up
with both of her parents

54:27.456 --> 54:28.805
just out in the wind,

54:28.935 --> 54:33.810
and she's in this really
odd position of, at times,

54:33.940 --> 54:36.639
having to be more grown up
than she really should be.

54:36.769 --> 54:39.163
She's had to be a fighter
from the beginning,

54:39.294 --> 54:42.471
and that's been important
to survive.

54:42.601 --> 54:44.995
But at the same time,
there's just ways in which

54:45.125 --> 54:46.605
she's still very much a child,

54:46.736 --> 54:49.739
and if a bully is saying
terrible things to her...

54:49.869 --> 54:51.001
You talk too much.

54:51.131 --> 54:53.133
No wonder your mom
abandoned you.

54:53.264 --> 54:55.005
...she's a little lost
and just reacts

54:55.135 --> 54:56.876
in the way that she knows how,

54:57.007 --> 55:00.358
and I think that she's also
pulled back from that, though,

55:00.489 --> 55:02.752
realizing, like,
"I think I might have reacted

55:02.882 --> 55:05.885
a little too strongly,"
but she's so upset.

55:06.016 --> 55:10.107
And so how do kids deal
with things that are just beyond

55:10.237 --> 55:12.414
what they should really
have to grapple with?

55:12.544 --> 55:16.200
And how does that take
an apocalyptic flavor.

55:16.331 --> 55:17.462
In this episode,

55:17.593 --> 55:20.030
which was directed
by Gregory Nicotero,

55:20.160 --> 55:22.989
I do think he might have
purposely kind of used

55:23.120 --> 55:25.818
some of that feel
from the earlier season

55:25.949 --> 55:28.734
where Rick and Carl
were kind of talking about

55:28.865 --> 55:32.347
what it's like to lose people
and just no more kid stuff.

55:32.477 --> 55:34.653
Rosita is there with Judith,

55:34.784 --> 55:36.829
and I think we wanted
to tell a story

55:36.960 --> 55:38.483
that it has taken the village

55:38.614 --> 55:41.486
to raise all the children
of the apocalypse.

55:41.617 --> 55:46.448
Rosita is one of Judith's
many, many aunts

55:46.578 --> 55:49.799
that just adores her
and would do anything for her.

55:49.929 --> 55:52.497
And I think that it's important
for Judith to feel that.

55:52.628 --> 55:54.804
And I think, you know,
Christian did a great job

55:54.934 --> 55:57.676
kind of, like, telling this
story that is comforting,

55:57.807 --> 55:59.939
but at the same time,
like, it's just kind of

56:00.070 --> 56:02.855
like I'm gonna tell you that
it's going to keep on hurting.

56:02.986 --> 56:06.163
She's very real about the nature
of grief with this child.

56:06.293 --> 56:07.730
And it still makes
Judith feel better

56:07.860 --> 56:10.428
because it's like
she'd rather know the truth.

56:10.559 --> 56:12.909
Pieces of wood
are nice...

56:15.520 --> 56:17.087
...but you don't need
that to remember

56:17.217 --> 56:18.610
how much they loved you.
