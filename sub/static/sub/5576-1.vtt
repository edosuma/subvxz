00:49.600 --> 00:51.728
Announcer:
Now, more "Morning Sickness"

00:51.880 --> 00:54.360
with Dicky and Sludge.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.364
Dicky: 7:35 a.m.,
that's 35 minutes past the hour,

00:57.520 --> 00:59.409
25 minutes
till the top of the hour--

00:59.560 --> 01:01.289
Sludge: Hey, Dicky,

01:01.440 --> 01:03.329
we got a real live celebrity
in here with us.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.244
- Dicky: Yes, we do.
- Sludge: You all know him

01:05.400 --> 01:07.243
- from the "Bro Show"--
- Dicky: "Bro Show"!

01:07.400 --> 01:10.722
Sludge: "Dude, Where's My Beer?"
and "Dude, Where's My Beer? 4."

01:10.920 --> 01:13.446
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bruce Madsen is here!

01:13.600 --> 01:16.080
- Dicky, Sludge: Bruce!
- Yeah, hey.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.208
- So, Bruce, how are you, man?
- Good, good, man.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.250
The last time I saw you, Bruce,
you were with all those celebrities,

01:21.400 --> 01:22.845
you were raising barns.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.843
- What was the name of that show?
- "Celebrity Barn Raising."

01:25.000 --> 01:27.207
"Celebrity Barn Raising."
I loved it.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.523
But there was that mulatto chick.
Oh, my God, what was her name?

01:30.680 --> 01:31.761
I don't think you can say
"mulatto."

01:35.400 --> 01:39.530
Hey, Bruce Madsen will be
at Hilarities Thursday through Sunday.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.842
Jack Taylor--
what is going on with that guy?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.287
- He's "en fuego."
- On fire, he is.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.442
So what about your old partner, man?

01:46.600 --> 01:48.284
He's hosting the Emmys.
What's the deal?

01:48.440 --> 01:52.001
- This guy can't stop, right?
- He's, you know, a talented guy.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.606
- I knew it when I met him.
- A long time ago, huh?

01:54.800 --> 01:55.961
Bruce:
Yeah, I said, "This is the guy."

01:56.120 --> 01:57.406
Do you, like,
ask him for loans?

01:57.560 --> 01:59.164
No, I-- I-- well, you know, we--

01:59.320 --> 02:00.731
That's what I would do.
I'd be like, "Dude"--

02:00.880 --> 02:03.690
"Dude, where's my money?"

02:03.840 --> 02:07.162
I'm happy doing what I'm doing,
he's happy doing what he's doing,

02:07.320 --> 02:09.482
- and, you know, God bless him.
- And what are you doing?

02:09.639 --> 02:12.564
- I'm doing stand-up, like, you know--
- That's what I hear.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.645
- So, you had this amazing career in TV.
- Mm-hmm.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.529
You obviously did
tons of comedy before.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.250
- Now you're going back to your roots.
- Yeah.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.846
Well, you know, I started off
as a stand-up,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.163
and I drifted away
from my roots for a while...

02:26.320 --> 02:28.721
- Dicky: You drifted.
- Bruce: ...and I wanted to get back

02:28.880 --> 02:30.120
on the road with the fans.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.691
That's where the electricity is.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.645
You know, and I wanted
to experience that rush again.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.362
Addison, Texas,
see the rodeo's in town, yeah?

03:59.520 --> 04:01.761
I like the bull riding.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.570
We should all be
more like the bull, man.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.569
We should all be wired
like that bull,

04:05.760 --> 04:08.081
'cause that bull is living
in the moment, man.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.242
He's living for today.
I mean, think about us.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.961
All we really are
is just an accumulation

04:14.120 --> 04:17.442
of every shitty thing that's
ever happened to us before today.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.444
I don't remember getting married.
I remember getting divorced.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.046
I don't remember when I got
my television show picked up,

04:23.240 --> 04:24.969
I remember
when it was cancelled.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.726
I just remember the bad shit.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.530
But think about the bull.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.887
It's just sitting there, cooped up
in that aluminum pen,

04:32.080 --> 04:35.289
and he's like, "God damn it,
I gotta get free, man!"

04:35.440 --> 04:39.240
And then at some point,
a 140-pound racist from Wyoming

04:39.400 --> 04:42.961
gets lowered down onto his back,
and the bull's confused.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.282
The bull's like, "What the fuck
has happened up there?

04:45.440 --> 04:47.807
What is that?
Shit, there's somebody on me!"

04:47.960 --> 04:50.042
And then that guy
pulls on the rope

04:50.200 --> 04:53.044
and the bull goes, "Fuck, that guy
just yanked on my ballsack!"

04:54.600 --> 04:56.443
"Oh, my God,
am I gonna kill this guy."

04:56.600 --> 04:59.001
And the bull's like, "Oh, man,
if anyone was stupid enough

04:59.160 --> 05:01.686
to ever let me out of this cage,
I would-- what?

05:01.840 --> 05:04.889
The door's open?
Holy shit, it's killing time.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.761
I'm going to take this horn,
I'm gonna punch it through your sternum,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.809
I'm gonna wear you
like a maxi pad."

05:10.960 --> 05:14.885
And at the last second,
some guy in Wrangler "shants"

05:15.080 --> 05:18.801
and Robin Williams suspenders
with rainbow paint on his face

05:19.000 --> 05:21.731
pops out and goes,
"Hey, bull, over here!"

05:21.920 --> 05:24.446
And the bull's like,
"Huh?"

05:27.080 --> 05:29.970
"Well, I was gonna-- well,
I guess I'll kill this guy instead."

05:30.120 --> 05:32.691
Imagine if every shitty thing
that happened to you,

05:32.840 --> 05:34.330
you just had a rodeo clown for.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.681
"What's that, honey?
You want a divorce?"

05:35.840 --> 05:37.046
"Hey, look over here!"

05:37.200 --> 05:40.602
"What? Huh?
What were we talking about?

05:40.760 --> 05:44.526
You're fucking my brother?
I don't-- there was a clown."

05:44.680 --> 05:49.208
Career's going in the fucking toilet,
agent not returning my phone calls,

05:49.360 --> 05:53.206
I'm doing six shows
in a shitbox in Addison, Texas.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.647
Hey, I got a rodeo clown!

06:00.720 --> 06:02.609
Oh, sweetie, I gotta go.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.888
I love you, too.
Okay.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.486
- Hey, great set. Wow.
- Thanks.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.210
So, listen.
Gotta tell you, though,

06:09.360 --> 06:11.522
sad that we didn't quite make
our guarantee.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.008
We didn't make "our" guarantee?
I have a guarantee.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.481
I made my guarantee
when I got on the Southwest flight

06:17.640 --> 06:18.721
and came to Addison, Texas.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.326
- Yeah, but think about how we did.
- We sold out.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.090
Sold out Friday,
we sold out Saturday.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.605
Whoa, whoa-- early shows, okay?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.888
Now, the late shows,
eh, about two-thirds.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.407
I gave a lot of radio comps
to get people in the seats,

06:29.560 --> 06:30.641
and we both know about tonight.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.768
You were there.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.410
Oh, fuck.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.530
Mark, I had
an $8,000 guarantee.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.569
Yeah, which we did not make.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.530
Listen, don't worry about it.
You'll do better next time.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.409
"Next time"?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.403
Oh, there's not gonna be
a next time, Mark.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.485
 I guarantee
there's not gonna be a next time.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.206
Do you know that you're booked
for the second week in August?

06:56.120 --> 06:58.009
Tender?

07:01.760 --> 07:04.445
You gotta learn the definition
of "guarantee" and "tender."

07:10.520 --> 07:13.091
Hey!
"Bro Show"!

07:13.280 --> 07:15.567
"Bro Show"
was some funny shit.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.882
- Thank you.
- What you been up to, man?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.605
- I'm working.
- Just chillin'?

07:19.760 --> 07:21.444
Don't worry.
Something will come up.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.441
Announcer: ...kicks off a huge weekend
with a lot of divisional rivalries.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.803
Somebody's going to the playoffs
and somebody's staying home.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.566
Man: When your mother tells you
to clean your room--

07:41.720 --> 07:43.882
Announcer #2:
Bienvenidos, hombres!

07:44.040 --> 07:47.761
!Se trata de la "Bro Show"!

07:54.880 --> 07:57.884
Dubbed voice: Me llamo Jack.
Mi mejor amigo es--

07:58.080 --> 08:00.242
Announcer #3: What happens
when you mix baked goods with murder?

08:00.400 --> 08:03.643
- Joann Fluke knows.
- All right, that's it, thank you.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.326
That was our first-ever
prime time special.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.323
I hope you guys
had a very good time.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.289
That was the fastest
two hours of my life.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.487
And you know what?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.005
That was the greatest
10 years of my life.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.162
I want to thank my guests
George Clooney,

08:15.320 --> 08:18.324
I wanna thank Zooey Deschanel,
Jamie Foxx, Robert Downey, Jr.,

08:18.480 --> 08:21.290
but most importantly,
I wanna thank you.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.930
You have made
the "Jack Taylor Show"

08:23.080 --> 08:25.287
the number one
late-night talk show.

08:25.480 --> 08:30.122
From the bottom of my heart,
thank you for doing this for me.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.609
- How was the room, Mr. Madsen?
- Exquisite.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.091
Great.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.322
All right, if you could just review this
and sign down there

09:24.480 --> 09:27.609
and then we'll just put a charge on
the card you left when you checked in.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.604
It's charging 250 for cleaning?

09:30.760 --> 09:33.684
Yes. We are a 100%
smoke-free environment.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.771
You initialed the box saying that
you would not smoke in the room.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.890
Yeah, I-- I don't smoke.
I didn't smoke.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.611
Well, housekeeping did detect
some smoke in the room, so...

09:43.760 --> 09:46.764
When I came in,
I did smell something,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.684
like somebody
had been smoking,

09:48.840 --> 09:51.844
like-- ahem-- you know,
like secondhand smoke.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.321
It's a courtesy to the next family
who's gonna be in the room.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.131
Right, but maybe they're smokers, too.
Maybe they like it.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.765
Maybe they like
fluffing the pillow, going,

09:58.920 --> 10:01.287
"Finally, some nicotine," you know?

10:01.440 --> 10:03.408
You could just take that off,
you know.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.164
No, I'm sorry, sir, I can't.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.163
You had guaranteed
with your signature

10:07.320 --> 10:09.322
- that you would pay the cleaning fee.
- Right, guaranteed.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.970
- "Guarantee."
- I'm sorry, sir.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.724
Word's been coming up a lot
for me lately.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.127
We are a 100%
smoke-free facility.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.851
Okay, I beat off 46 times
when I was in that room.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.081
46 times.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.641
If you asked a family,
"What would you rather have?

10:21.800 --> 10:24.849
Guy smokes half a light cigarette
in the bathroom

10:25.000 --> 10:27.890
or middle-aged
frustrated comedian

10:28.040 --> 10:31.123
attempts to shatter
his high school jack-off record?"

10:31.280 --> 10:34.443
The bedspread
looks like a Jackson Pollock.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.887
You understand?
But that's free?

10:37.040 --> 10:39.122
No box to check for jacking off?

10:39.320 --> 10:43.882
So, half a light cigarette--
that's $250?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.286
- Your signature, sir--
- Ma'am, would you rather

10:45.440 --> 10:47.681
stay in a room where a guy
just smoked half a cigarette

10:47.840 --> 10:49.808
or tried to jack himself
to death?

10:51.800 --> 10:54.929
Okay. You know what?
You're 100% smoke-free?

10:55.080 --> 10:56.320
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.643
Maybe it's not quite that high.
Yeah-- you're not 100%.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.330
- Sir, please.
- No, I'm gonna smoke

11:01.480 --> 11:03.847
and then you'll be down
to, what, the high 80s?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.685
But not 100.
It can't be 100.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.683
I'm gonna smoke, all right?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.446
Ah...

11:13.600 --> 11:14.965
It's relaxing.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.724
Should we just charge
the second cleaning fee

11:16.880 --> 11:18.928
to the credit card
we have on file?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.324
Hey, Molly.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.244
Miss me, girl?

11:43.400 --> 11:45.846
How you feeling?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.968
Hanging in there?

12:40.600 --> 12:43.649
Sweetie, can you unlock
the door for me?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.883
No. You're not allowed
in here.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.761
Harper, unlock this door
right now

12:50.920 --> 12:53.321
and let me into my house.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.247
Tina?

13:01.400 --> 13:04.051
You're such a pain in the ass,
Harper.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.443
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.529
Kim told us
not to let you in.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.290
Does your mom
tell all your friends

13:11.440 --> 13:14.284
not to let me into my house
that I paid for?

13:14.480 --> 13:16.244
We're under pretty strict orders.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.283
Did you tell him?

13:18.480 --> 13:20.801
We both got into USC.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.290
Oh, great, USC.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.329
The super expensive
private school?

13:25.480 --> 13:26.811
What is that,
like, 50 grand a year?

13:26.960 --> 13:29.406
It's actually $60,000 a year.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.449
Harper, don't you have
something else to do?

13:31.600 --> 13:34.126
Facebook?
lnstagramming?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.123
Cutting yourself?

13:39.320 --> 13:42.369
What happened to our plan
to go into UCLA for free?

13:42.520 --> 13:45.126
Dad, I was totally
on board with that plan.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.841
- So what happened?
- Turns out UCLA wasn't.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.163
You're female, you're a minority,
you're a straight-A student.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.651
They gotta take you.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.802
Apparently,
I'm not a minority at UCLA.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.167
Turns out the place
is crawling with Asians.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.005
We need to find a school
that needs Asians.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.284
Pack your bags.
We're going to Grambling.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.523
- Mom wants me to stay local.
- I need a beer.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.489
Come on, Dad.
Don't get me in trouble.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.849
Don't feel like you need to be loyal
to your mom, you know.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.365
We were looking
through those brochures,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.000
she was eyeballing
the Romanian kid.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.208
What's with the O'Doul's?
Where's Chad's Blue Moon?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.761
I think he's on some kind
of master cleanse.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.808
Well, I wish he'd marry
your mother

14:24.960 --> 14:26.849
and stop the "master cleanse"
of my wallet.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.048
And by the way,
I don't trust this Chad.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.884
He's a bad influence.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.486
A shaky role model.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.047
I hate the idea that you're living
under the same roof

14:36.200 --> 14:38.851
as a guy who drinks
nonalcoholic beer.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.889
He's gross, too.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.520
I walked in on him
masturbating in the bathroom.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.604
- Did he know you were at home?
- No, I came home early.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.844
Eh, let's--

14:50.000 --> 14:51.490
let's not rush to judgment
on that one.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.530
I mean, Chad's a lot of things,
but we'll give him a pass.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.126
I've also been accepted
to three other schools,

14:57.280 --> 14:59.089
but they're pretty far away.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.164
And Mom likes the idea of USC
because I can sleep in my own bed

15:02.320 --> 15:04.482
- whenever I wanted.
- Of course your mom likes USC.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.927
She's like a waiter suggesting
"surf and turf."

15:07.080 --> 15:09.128
It's the most expensive thing
on the menu.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.763
- Harper: She's going to USC.
- Fuck off, Harper.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.730
I've actually been offered a pretty
sweet scholarship from Bennington.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.086
For the violin?

15:18.240 --> 15:20.607
I haven't played the violin
since I was nine.

15:20.760 --> 15:23.650
And they still offered you
a scholarship?

15:23.800 --> 15:25.962
- That's unbelievable.
- It's for something I wrote,

15:26.120 --> 15:29.522
but Mom would be pretty bummed
if I moved across the country.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.489
She's gonna be disappointed
no matter what.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.530
I suggest we all stop
tiptoeing around her

15:34.680 --> 15:36.523
like a cat on a hot tin roof,
you know?

15:36.680 --> 15:38.330
We all just have to step up
and look her in the eye.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.720
I mean, that's what I do.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.405
Woman:
Hello! We're home!

15:41.560 --> 15:43.164
Uh, shit. Okay, I gotta--

15:43.320 --> 15:45.561
- Oh--
- Bye, Dad.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.643
Okay.
Don't tell her I was here.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.842
Harper:
Bruce is in the house again!

15:54.120 --> 15:55.849
I knew it!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.445
I knew you'd be in the house.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.290
What are you gonna do,
call the Feds?

15:59.440 --> 16:02.250
Good luck making that case.
I pay the property taxes.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.129
Hey, half of that
is Kim's money.

16:04.280 --> 16:08.968
I-- listen, Chad, can we just talk,
man to barnacle?

16:11.320 --> 16:13.004
Bruce: How long you been
living in my house?

16:13.200 --> 16:16.170
- Three and a half years?
- 41 months.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.800
Is that less
than three and a half years?

16:18.960 --> 16:22.169
It's more-- it's less.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.687
You sell jewelry on eBay, right?

16:24.840 --> 16:27.002
Custom jewelry
and dream catchers.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.810
I gotta get me
one of those dream catchers.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.121
Those things work.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.567
You caught my dream
of living in my house.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.524
You can sell that crap
anywhere, right?

16:35.720 --> 16:38.883
Hell, yeah.
I'd like to do it in Montana.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.441
Okay, so you don't need
to be in LA.

16:41.640 --> 16:46.328
See, my business forces me
to live in Los Angeles.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.760
You know, Bruce,

16:47.920 --> 16:50.844
for someone who says
they have to be in LA,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.844
I've noticed you spend
a lot of time not in LA.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.891
That house is worth five times
what I paid for it.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.771
Now, if you can
convince Kim to sell it,

17:00.920 --> 17:04.049
I'd be happy to let you
wet your bald beak.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.771
Kim and I don't have
any secrets,

17:06.960 --> 17:09.281
and this is not going to be
one of them.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.644
So this is--

17:12.839 --> 17:15.844
this is gonna be one of the secrets
or not gonna be one of the secrets?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.684
No secrets.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.207
"No secrets."
Okay.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.724
Does Kim know about the time

17:21.880 --> 17:24.201
my daughter walked in
on you beating off?

17:24.359 --> 17:27.045
That's an Iroquois purging ritual.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.487
Yeah, and this is
a fucking Leinenkugel.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.642
Iroquois purging ritual!

17:32.840 --> 17:35.081
You should be comfortable
with your own body!

17:45.480 --> 17:48.245
- Michael.
- Hey!

17:48.400 --> 17:50.402
- What's up, man?
- Where's Phil?

17:50.560 --> 17:52.324
I don't know.
I've been here for a while.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.926
Bruce:
Oh. Thanks.

17:55.080 --> 17:58.004
Black guy beats a Jew to a deli?
This is a first.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.085
This isn't the first time
I arrived before Phil, okay?

18:02.240 --> 18:04.049
Oh, no. We've been
coming here for 15 years.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.602
You've been here before Phil
one time and one time only.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.081
And that's when you forgot
to set your clock back.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.129
All right, come on.
Let's hear it.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.329
Black men-- fastest people
on the planet, right?

18:16.360 --> 18:17.930
Slowest pedestrians.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.926
Listen, don't try
your racist material on me.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.804
I'm sure it killed
at the Klan meeting.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.042
You know what I do
when I'm not onstage?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.281
I'm my real self.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.284
I don't try material out
on people

18:30.440 --> 18:32.010
- and use funny voices.
- Understood.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.401
- You see the new waitress?
- No "Maya Angelou."

18:34.560 --> 18:36.289
Waitress?
Ahem.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.602
I would like a BLT--

18:38.800 --> 18:41.201
"Belief, Love and Trust."

18:41.360 --> 18:44.443
Light on the mayo,
heavy on the pride.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.971
Freedom.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.282
Okay, BLT.
And for you?

18:48.480 --> 18:50.767
Spanish omelet,
and then our friend's gonna join us.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.969
- Just get him a bagel and lox.
- I'll put that right in.

18:54.120 --> 18:58.011
My child, I dream of the day
when salt and pepper

18:58.160 --> 19:02.643
will one day live in harmony
and share the same shaker.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.326
Salt, pepper, and Tabasco

19:05.480 --> 19:07.528
will not have to be
segregated,

19:07.680 --> 19:10.763
like they are now
on the prison yard.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.321
Okay.
I'll put that order in.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.529
Carry on.
She got it. She got it.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.206
She doesn't know Maya Angelou.
She thinks you're fucking retarded.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.169
- Phil: Hey!
- Michael: Mr. Producer.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.049
- Bruce: Hey, Captain Sitcom.
- Phil: Good news!

19:24.200 --> 19:26.282
Bruce: Oh, it's always
good news with Phil, isn't it?

19:26.440 --> 19:29.171
- Bulgaria is in.
- Oh, my God.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.685
You think the road we do sucks?

19:30.840 --> 19:33.161
Have fun in Bulgaria,
Daddy Warbucks.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.685
Oh, I don't have to go anymore.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.842
They just adapt the show
and send the checks.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.928
But... you had to go
to Russia, right?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.491
Yeah, that was miserable.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.927
But then you don't have to go
to Bulgaria?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.600
Well, we just e-mailed them
the old scripts,

19:47.760 --> 19:49.444
and they wire us the money.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.170
Now I have to kill myself.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.685
Hey, enough already
about "Right Behind You."

19:52.840 --> 19:55.047
Finally, enough about
your crappy sitcom.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.929
How about this guy?
Did you tell him?

19:57.080 --> 19:58.161
What?

19:58.320 --> 20:00.527
We were talking about stuff
more important.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.205
Like what?
What's more important?

20:02.360 --> 20:06.365
- Maya Angelou. Ahem.
- Well, tell him.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.363
Well, you tell him.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.882
Michael's pilot is getting shot.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.884
I told you--
"Milk Chocolate"?

20:15.040 --> 20:18.681
It's about the only black dairy farmer
in 1960s Wisconsin.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.649
It's like "Green Acres"
meets "Good Times."

20:20.800 --> 20:23.121
I thought that was a joke.
I thought you were kidding.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.766
You're fucking serious
about this?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.001
Why didn't you tell me?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.806
Well, I was gonna tell you,
but I know how depressed you are

20:29.960 --> 20:31.724
when you come off the road,

20:31.880 --> 20:33.644
and I didn't wanna throw it
in your face.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.531
You didn't think I could handle it.
You didn't think I'd be happy for you?

20:36.680 --> 20:39.206
_ Are You?
- Yes!

20:39.360 --> 20:41.806
No!
I mean, I--

20:41.960 --> 20:43.644
I don't know.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.604
I just-- you know what?

20:47.400 --> 20:49.767
I'm not even hungry anymore.
Just eat my food.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.410
I gotta talk to Baby Doll.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.011
Sir, I beseech you,

20:53.160 --> 20:56.881
do not throw thyself
on the "swo-ward" of despair.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.882
Uh, now that it's just the two of us,

21:00.040 --> 21:01.565
can you move over there?

21:02.760 --> 21:03.966
Come on, man.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.121
♪ All out like Jenny
did the Super Bowl ♪

21:30.280 --> 21:32.362
♪ All in on these hos
like I'm D Roll ♪

21:32.560 --> 21:34.847
♪ You niggas bug me,
I look better in my street clothes ♪

21:35.000 --> 21:36.081
♪ Pull up... ♪

22:06.040 --> 22:07.166
Baby Doll, hi.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.527
Let me just get rid of someone
on the phone who isn't you.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.691
Bruce: Listen, I'm standing out--

22:20.520 --> 22:21.965
Sorry-.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.521
Had to just get rid of someone
who's not you.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.445
- Bruce: Really? Who?
- Well, that was another client.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.443
The more important thing is
he's not you.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.568
I know everyone
on your roster, Baby Doll.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.165
- Who was it?
- He's not you.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.765
He's not as tall as you.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.491
- Who was it?
- Never mind who was it.

22:37.640 --> 22:40.371
Stop with "Who was it?"
It's someone who's not you.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.204
It's someone
who's not funny like you.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.930
Really?
You know I can see you?

22:44.080 --> 22:47.243
You're wearing your stupid
Keith Partridge wig.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.530
Hey, baby doll!

22:51.720 --> 22:54.485
- I saw what you did!
- Guess we don't need these anymore.

22:55.880 --> 22:59.168
So you pretend to have someone
on the other line?

22:59.320 --> 23:01.561
That's your move?

23:01.720 --> 23:04.564
- I do it for you.
- For me? You do it for me?

23:04.720 --> 23:08.167
It's like the boxing trainer
who calls all his fighters "Champ."

23:08.360 --> 23:11.569
- It boosts their confidence.
- You didn't do it five years ago.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.802
You didn't need it
five years ago.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.089
I gotta get off the road.
You gotta get me off the road.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.368
It's killing me.
What happened to those deals?

23:19.520 --> 23:22.251
Remember the holding deals?
Development deals?

23:22.400 --> 23:24.129
Remember those deals
where you just stayed home

23:24.280 --> 23:25.930
and you made a bunch of money
for doing nothing?

23:26.080 --> 23:28.560
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

23:28.760 --> 23:31.206
It was staring me in the face
the whole time.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.840
You know what you should do?
You should open for Howie.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.809
Howie Mandel loves you.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.928
That's right, you'd be
the opening act for Howie.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.163
You know why? It's on the road,
but it's the road done right.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.926
The only problem with that
is I'm a thousand times

23:44.080 --> 23:46.447
fucking funnier
than Howie Mandel.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.604
Really?

23:49.760 --> 23:51.922
You think the Who opens
for Air Supply?

23:52.080 --> 23:55.243
Okay, and that makes you the Who
in this analogy?

23:55.400 --> 23:57.448
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm the Who.
- Howie is the Who.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.648
- Howie's not the Who.
- Maybe you are the Who.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.009
Last time I pitched you
at a network, they said, "Who?"

24:05.760 --> 24:08.081
Baby Doll,
you're fucking insane.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.924
I'm insane?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.287
You're sitting
in a handmade house.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.408
You see the new Jaguar in the driveway
when you walked in?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.801
'Course you did.
You want it? 'Course you do.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.964
You know who's up in my bed
right now? Everyone.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.602
You should be thrilled
because you draw so well on the road.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.649
It's 'cause I used to be on TV.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.086
But I don't wanna go
on the road anymore,

24:27.240 --> 24:28.571
so I wanna get back on TV.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.484
So get me back on TV.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.530
Look, don't worry.
We'll come up with something.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.011
I always do.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.282
Now, come on.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.807
You know why you came here?
Let's see it.

24:39.960 --> 24:43.169
Bring it in here.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.527
Baby Doll:
My guy. Hey...

24:45.680 --> 24:47.569
does one of us
have a hard-on?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.809
Kim: So...

24:52.960 --> 24:55.281
...you were
in the house again?

24:55.440 --> 24:58.250
- I was in my house.
- Let me tell you something.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.847
If you'd spent a little less time
out here when we were married,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.606
you might still be living
in the house.

25:04.760 --> 25:08.526
I spoke to Tina and she said
that you were encouraging her

25:08.680 --> 25:11.160
to go to school
3,000 miles away.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.364
I was encouraging her
to go to a school I could afford.

25:14.520 --> 25:18.605
- She wants to go to USC.
- Well, USC is 60 grand a year.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.240
Well, can't you get another TV show?

25:21.400 --> 25:23.562
Another TV show?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.529
Why didn't I think of that?

25:25.680 --> 25:28.206
Well, maybe you need to start
thinking more creatively.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.682
I mean, look at that guy--
that-- that-- "Tosh.0" guy.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.564
- Look at him.
- Thanks for making my point.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.731
I gotta compete with every
23-year-old YouTube Internet star

25:37.880 --> 25:39.450
and his talking fucking orange.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.721
What do they need me for?

25:40.880 --> 25:42.564
Well, you better think
of something, okay?

25:42.720 --> 25:44.722
'Cause I'm not having
my little gir my baby--

25:44.880 --> 25:47.451
go to school
3,000 miles away.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.329
Right, because you wouldn't
be able to justify

25:49.520 --> 25:52.569
living in 5,500 square feet
with "Lord Sitar."

25:52.720 --> 25:54.085
What are you talking about?

25:54.280 --> 25:56.123
Sell.
Just sell.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.924
You're living in a giant ATM

25:58.080 --> 26:01.243
and the PIN code
is "Move your ass out."

26:04.240 --> 26:06.846
This is Tina's home, okay?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.930
And I am not selling it
out from under her.

26:10.080 --> 26:13.129
- So this is just about Tina?
- Yes, it is.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.930
Okay.
By the way, you look different.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.082
Did you do something
to your hair?

26:22.080 --> 26:25.368
Wel

26:28.240 --> 26:29.287
Attendant: May we have your attention?
We'd like to point out

26:29.480 --> 26:30.970
our safety features.
To properly fasten your seat belts...

26:31.120 --> 26:32.201
- Bruce: Hey.
- Hey.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.890
I think you're in my seat.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.963
Oh, am I?
I kinda like the window.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.281
Are you cool
with my sitting here?

26:37.440 --> 26:39.761
- What's the difference, right?
- Thanks very much, man.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.127
- I appreciate it.
- We're going to the same place.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.250
Come here, baby.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.640
Good boy.

26:54.440 --> 26:58.081
- Do you like dogs?
- Yeah, I love dogs.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.050
In yards... on the ground,
you know?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.965
That's normally where he likes to be.
He doesn't like to be confined.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.088
This is Raffles.
He's a service dog.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.481
What's the service
he provides?

27:08.640 --> 27:11.530
- He's an antianxiety dog.
- Bruce: Mm-hmm.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.047
He helps you.
See how he's just calm?

27:14.200 --> 27:16.806
Yeah. You just want to fly
with your pet, right?

27:16.960 --> 27:18.086
No, he's certified.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.691
- He's a working--
- He's "certified."

27:19.840 --> 27:23.162
You gave your doctor $50
and he certified him.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.651
You don't even know my dog.
I mean, you barely even met.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.211
Well, what about my anxiety?

27:29.360 --> 27:31.806
I have anxiety about flying with dogs.
How about that?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.650
I get a service pelican?

27:33.800 --> 27:36.610
Hey, I want you to meet Gilligan,
my service pelican.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.201
What about
when the dog defecates?

27:39.360 --> 27:41.328
He's gotta defecate
at some point, right?

27:41.480 --> 27:44.404
- What happens when you defecate, sir?
- I don't shit in the aisle.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.006
Aw, looks like we have a cute little
furry traveler with us today.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.606
Say hi. Hi!

27:49.760 --> 27:52.684
Sir, I'm gonna need you to go ahead
and stow the backpack on the floor

27:52.840 --> 27:54.649
underneath the seat
in front of you. Thanks.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.609
So, I gotta put the backpack

27:56.760 --> 27:58.649
under the seat in front of me,

27:58.800 --> 28:02.486
but the furry, farting,
Lyme disease-spreading,

28:02.640 --> 28:04.210
shedding mutt--

28:04.360 --> 28:06.283
that can just stay on the gut
the whole flight?

28:09.200 --> 28:11.282
- Can we switch back?
- I'm good.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.922
Bruce: How's the batting average
with the hotel key card?

28:15.080 --> 28:17.162
For me, way under 50%.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.526
Are you guys
optimistic like me

28:18.680 --> 28:20.648
where you punch it in,
you pull it out,

28:20.840 --> 28:23.889
the red light comes on and you go,
"Fuck it, I'm going anyway"?

28:24.040 --> 28:25.530
It's just like "ka-chunk."

28:25.720 --> 28:29.008
Like, "What?
It didn't work?"

28:29.160 --> 28:32.881
And then you do this move--
"I'll just wipe this bad boy."

28:33.040 --> 28:36.010
Oh, yeah.
10 seconds of super denim.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.970
Now it's gonna spring to life.
Push it in, pull it out again.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.885
Red light again.
"Ka-chunk." Doesn't work.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.849
And you know they're gonna
make it your fault.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.846
- Key card's not working.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.721
The cell phone will demagnetize
the little strip on the key card.

28:51.880 --> 28:54.611
So if you can,
you wanna keep those things

28:54.760 --> 28:56.091
apart from one another.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.447
- Do you carry a cell phone?
- Cell phone?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.882
I don't believe
I know what that is.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.850
Oh, it's one of those kind
that don't have the cord on it?

29:05.000 --> 29:08.368
I think I have one, but I don't--
I don't bring it outside the house.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.488
Why would you want
one of those when you travel?

29:10.680 --> 29:12.603
And then she tosses it
back on you again.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.603
Do you have a credit card
in your wallet?

29:14.760 --> 29:17.206
I have a credit card.
It's in a Mason jar.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.926
It's buried in my backyard.
I don't travel with it.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.447
I wasn't born yesterday.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.922
You wanna try and keep those
apart from one another, if you can.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.809
"You know what?
You're right, sweetheart.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.601
I really should have just
duct-taped it to a mop handle...

29:31.760 --> 29:35.321
and carried it over my fucking head
when I went out to dinner that night."

29:35.480 --> 29:36.561
And this one...

29:36.720 --> 29:38.051
You might have used it
too quickly.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.362
- Did you go straight to your room?
- Oh, boy.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.126
I got egg on my face.
I went right to the room.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.601
I'm one of these maniacs that
when you say, "There's your elevator.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.043
You're on the fifth floor,"
I just go to the elevator.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.804
"Normally
when I check in,

29:50.960 --> 29:53.201
you know, I'll hit
a local homeless shelter,

29:53.360 --> 29:56.284
maybe swing by the park
and blow a tranny.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.084
You're right, I should have killed
at least seven hours

29:58.240 --> 30:00.163
before I had any business
going to my fucking room

30:00.360 --> 30:01.885
and beating--
I mean, taking a nap."

30:08.640 --> 30:11.610
And my agent said I need to get
my eyebrows waxed, you know.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.411
Or-- sorry, my eyebrow waxed,
you know,

30:14.560 --> 30:17.086
so I have two of 'em
when I go out on auditions.

30:17.240 --> 30:20.722
So I went
into the waxing place.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.649
They said, "What shape
do you want them in?"

30:22.840 --> 30:24.410
And I said, "What do you mean?"

30:24.560 --> 30:26.688
They said, "We'll shape 'em.
What shape do you want 'em in?"

30:26.880 --> 30:31.010
And I said, "Oh, just shape 'em
so it looks like I'm interested."

30:32.760 --> 30:35.604
You know, that way,
when my wife comes home

30:35.760 --> 30:38.161
and starts telling me
about her coworker with a cat,

30:38.320 --> 30:40.926
- you know, I'm already--
- Bruce, you're divorced.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.048
Yeah.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.010
I guess it didn't work.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.769
Here you go.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.969
You know, my son,
he loves those "Bro Show" DVDs.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.640
I bet you get a nice slice
of that action?

30:55.800 --> 30:58.167
You'd think
if you'd create and star

30:58.320 --> 31:00.800
in a show that you get a nickel
on the back end?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.526
No. I make a fucking penny
on those things.

31:03.680 --> 31:07.162
But you know that. I'm here.
I'm playing your shitbox, right?

31:07.320 --> 31:09.527
Hey, guess what.
The job ain't over.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.200
You gotta do a meet-and-greet
with those radio contest winners.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.521
Aw, fuck.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.927
- All right, let's get this over with.
- Come on.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.361
There you go.
Right over here.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.404
Well!
This is a surprise.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.961
- Look at you.
- Great show. I'm Sarah.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.884
Yeah. I'm Bruce.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.566
You're-- you're the contest winner.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.210
I'm actually--

31:37.360 --> 31:39.249
"Bro Show"!

31:39.400 --> 31:41.528
- Oh, my God.
- ls this the winner?

31:41.680 --> 31:44.047
- That's her.
- Yeah, Bruce!

31:44.200 --> 31:46.407
Makes sense. Yeah.

31:46.560 --> 31:49.564
Hey, if you don't shit,
you don't have to wash your hands.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.366
I'm Jane.
I learned that from the "Bro Show."

31:52.520 --> 31:54.363
- And she's drunk.
- She's drunk?

31:54.520 --> 31:56.249
- But I love you.
- All right, but you own it.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.926
So what did they make you do, 'cause
you gotta jump through some hoops

31:59.080 --> 32:02.448
to win those tickets--
like "caller 107."

32:02.600 --> 32:04.887
No, I just called in.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.362
But, like, hair-trigger
finger dial, pow!

32:08.520 --> 32:10.602
Like you gotta jump on it, right?

32:10.760 --> 32:13.684
- No, I just called in.
- Bruce: "For the phrase that pays."

32:13.840 --> 32:16.446
No. I got home,
I made some salsa,

32:16.600 --> 32:17.965
and they said,
"Do you want six?"

32:18.160 --> 32:22.006
And I was like,
"Pfft! No! Two is good."

32:22.160 --> 32:23.969
- They offered you six tickets?
- Yeah.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.283
Jane: I just called 'em up, you know?
They wanted-- my mom--

32:27.440 --> 32:29.124
- I understand that now. Okay.
- Okay.

32:30.120 --> 32:34.523
- You guys are an unlikely duo.
- Yeah. We used to work together.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.927
I had to drag her out.
Like, she don't wanna come.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.447
- I had to drag her with me.
- Bruce: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.291
- Jane: She had a good time.
- Now I'll be driving us home.

32:42.480 --> 32:46.610
After you come to the bar
and get a drink.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.489
- Jane: Huh? Come on. No?
- No, no, no.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.927
It's a really long drive.
We should get going.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.766
- This one lives in the sticks.
- Oh, yeah. I live in New Hampshire.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.605
New Hampshire?
No state income tax.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.728
Yeah, that's right,
the "Live Free or Die" state.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.008
Right, but I'm guessing
about midwinter,

33:02.160 --> 33:05.050
the second choice
seems like a better option.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.645
- All right.
- Sarah: Here we go.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.848
Okay. You gonna come by
my house?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.570
Okay, come on.
Nice to meet you.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.846
- Bruce: All right. Hey.
- Jane: Bye.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.128
- Good to meet you.
- Jane: I love you.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.369
Bruce: Hey, buddy.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.851
Hey!

33:21.000 --> 33:23.082
There he is.
My man!

33:23.240 --> 33:24.730
So good to see ya.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.565
Wow, my gosh,
you look thin.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.563
Airline portions.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.326
Hey, we should get a steak
at Mastro's soon.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.482
Let's do it. Any night.
I'm free.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.563
Not now. You know, another time
when I'm not so slammed.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.960
- I'm really busy. Yeah.
- Right.

33:38.160 --> 33:39.810
Hey, have a seat.
Have a seat, sit down.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.564
Sit down, my man.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.802
So, what do I owe the pleasure?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.207
I need a favor.

33:47.360 --> 33:49.010
All right,
how much do you need?

33:49.160 --> 33:51.083
- I don't need money.
- You don't need money?

33:51.240 --> 33:52.810
I heard you were living
in your garage.

33:52.960 --> 33:56.009
It's a garage, but I turned it
into a guest house.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.889
I just wanna be close to Tina.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.849
No, I was just thinking...

34:00.000 --> 34:01.445
you know,
I got a ton of new material

34:01.640 --> 34:03.802
and it's been forever
since I've been on your show.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.167
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.049
Let me-- let me run it
up the flagpole, okay?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.850
But you're the flagpole.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.971
No. Hey, man, when we moved to 11 :30,
everything changed.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.451
Everything goes
through the network now.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.011
The network is the flagpole.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.328
But I'll tell you what.
I'll run it up the network flagpole.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.608
- Sit tight. You comfortable?
- Yeah.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.206
You should be, man.
You're my man.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.007
Jack: They're so much heavier
than you think they're gonna be.

34:47.159 --> 34:50.004
- Yeah.
- My man, I have great news.

34:50.159 --> 34:52.242
So what night
are we talking about?

34:52.440 --> 34:54.248
What night?

34:54.440 --> 34:55.771
Every night.

34:55.920 --> 34:56.967
Every night?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.531
You come to work
on the "Jack Taylor Show"

34:58.680 --> 34:59.761
every single night,

34:59.920 --> 35:01.922
Monday through Friday--
every night.

35:03.760 --> 35:04.966
Co host?

35:09.120 --> 35:10.201
Announcer?

35:10.360 --> 35:11.600
It's the "Jack Taylor Show."

35:11.760 --> 35:13.649
I'll just be like a sniper
in the weeds

35:13.840 --> 35:15.285
just throwing in zingers.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.010
I meant more-- you come--

35:17.160 --> 35:20.960
okay, you-- you do stand-up
before the show.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.124
On your feet, telling jokes
in front of a live audience,

35:24.280 --> 35:26.442
you know, audience--
audience warm-up guy.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.291
You want me to warm up
your audience?

35:29.480 --> 35:30.720
Of course.
I'd be honored.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.644
Audience warm-up guys
make a lot of money, Bruce.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.328
You want me to be
your fluffer, Jack?

35:36.480 --> 35:38.130
That's fucking humiliating.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.129
I can't believe this is
how you look at me.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.368
I don't look at you
that way, Bruce.

35:42.520 --> 35:45.330
- That's how the business looks at you.
- Then fuck the business.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.965
I don't get you, man.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.288
You think this business

35:50.440 --> 35:52.044
is like a "punt, pass, and kick"
competition

35:52.200 --> 35:54.089
where all that matters is being funnier
than everybody else.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.129
Isn't that what it's about,
being funny?

35:56.280 --> 35:57.930
Wake the fuck up, Bruce.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.163
Funny has, like, a little bit
to do with it-- this much.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.448
It's like the figure skating
compulsories.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.001
You go around, you do a figure eight,
yeah, that's cool.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.766
But what you're judged on
in this business is the long program.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.526
You're using figure skating
analogies, Jack?

36:11.680 --> 36:14.889
- You've changed, buddy.
- You haven't, Bruce.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.088
You never wanted
to put in the work.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.605
The real work...

36:18.760 --> 36:19.966
of building a career.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.202
So instead, what do you do?
You hide behind your rebel flag?

36:22.360 --> 36:25.011
You're fucking
"Cliché Guevara," man.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.043
I'm offering you a job, Bruce.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.129
It's a good job.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.441
Take the job!

36:30.600 --> 36:32.523
Audience warm-up?

36:32.680 --> 36:34.489
I'd rather kill myself.

36:34.640 --> 36:39.168
Who wants Jelly Bellies?

36:41.160 --> 36:44.448
Sir, I can see you brought
your own jelly belly.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.161
Are you a big Jack Taylor fan?

36:49.320 --> 36:52.324
Not really.
I'm just here to see Rise Against.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.000
Just here to see the band, huh?

36:56.400 --> 36:59.404
Not here to see
my buddy Jack Taylor, huh? All right.

36:59.560 --> 37:02.040
Well, I'll ask Jack
to power through the monologue

37:02.240 --> 37:04.208
so we can get the band
out here for ya.

37:04.360 --> 37:08.046
Yeah, and while you're at it,
be sure to ask him for another job.

37:08.240 --> 37:10.846
Like, maybe he needs
his balls waxed.

37:11.040 --> 37:12.087
Crowd: Oh!

37:12.240 --> 37:14.242
All right, yeah,
that's good stuff

37:14.400 --> 37:17.563
coming from a guy
who's wearing Crocs.

37:17.720 --> 37:19.165
The thing about Crocs is, uh...

37:19.320 --> 37:21.084
it's a lot like being blown
by a dude.

37:21.240 --> 37:25.040
It feels great until you look down
and realize you're gay.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.964
Hey, fuck you, man!

37:27.120 --> 37:29.168
- My brother's gay.
- Relax, chill out.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.810
Announcer: Are you guys
ready for your headliner?

37:43.360 --> 37:44.930
You will recognize him
from the "Bro Show"

37:45.080 --> 37:47.128
and his many appearances
on "Jack Taylor Live."

37:47.320 --> 37:49.448
He was a nationally syndicated
radio show host.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.602
He was a "New York Times"
best-selling author.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.445
You may remember him
from "Dude, Where's My Beer?"

37:54.600 --> 37:57.729
He is the voice of Toe Jam on
Saturday morning's "Rumpus Rompers."

37:57.920 --> 38:02.369
He was named by "Rolling Stone"
as a top-100 comedian of 1999.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.682
Please give a warm
"Wonkers" welcome

38:04.880 --> 38:07.247
to the first runner-up
on "Celebrity Barn Raising,"

38:07.400 --> 38:10.483
Mr. Bruce Madsen!

38:13.640 --> 38:15.642
Thank you, thank you.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.121
Thanks so much for coming--

38:18.280 --> 38:19.566
coming out with, uh...

38:21.040 --> 38:22.883
What do we got going here?

38:23.040 --> 38:26.044
Oh, uh, the hearing impaired.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.129
Do you just say whatever I say?

38:28.320 --> 38:29.924
So I just say "cocksucker" and...

38:31.680 --> 38:33.170
I just say cocksucker and...

38:35.640 --> 38:37.290
You... Huh?

38:39.320 --> 38:41.163
Bruce:
Come on.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.448
I like my balls tickled.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.170
Look at this guy.
No wonder he's not laughing.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.129
He doesn't know
what's going on right now.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.327
All right, I'm gonna move on.

38:48.480 --> 38:51.404
I wanna see some laughing out of him.
You better step up your game.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.686
Ceiling fans.

38:52.840 --> 38:56.890
Could we put a little LED light
on these motherfucking devices

38:57.040 --> 38:59.964
so I can tell when it was shut off
versus on slow

39:00.120 --> 39:02.248
versus on vortex
versus on medium.

39:02.440 --> 39:06.570
Why does it even have the goddamn mode
where it moves no air?

39:06.720 --> 39:08.324
Shouldn't it just have
medium and high?

39:08.480 --> 39:11.370
Do we need
the "not doing anything"

39:11.520 --> 39:15.650
adding ambiance to me beating off
in my bedroom?

39:20.040 --> 39:21.644
Sucking my own cock.

39:24.080 --> 39:28.847
Don't. Don't short-trip my junk
with that move.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.048
That's fly fishing.
That's not cocksucking.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.726
All right, now listen,
I'm just saying this.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.360
This guy's not fucking cracked
a smile the whole night.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.291
I've seen more movement
out of an ice sculpture.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.323
Guy's been a fucking
cigar-store Indian

39:41.520 --> 39:44.569
dipped in liquid nitrogen
and hung in outer space.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.564
What I'm saying is--
is are you screwing my jokes up?

39:47.720 --> 39:50.530
Don't ask him if you're screwing up.
I'm asking you.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.523
What are you doing?

39:52.680 --> 39:53.806
I'm trying.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.485
You're trying,
but, I mean, do you...

39:56.960 --> 39:59.770
Why isn't he laughing?

39:59.920 --> 40:03.606
I can't make you funny.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.561
Cheers, whoa!

40:07.720 --> 40:09.245
- Yay.
- This is the last one, though.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.006
- What?
- Come on. Such a baby.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.924
- Damn, that's good.
- Bartender.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.605
Whoo!

40:18.760 --> 40:21.331
Isn't that that guy
from that show?

40:22.640 --> 40:24.608
Oh, my God,
that's totally that guy

40:24.760 --> 40:27.843
from, like, that--
the "Celebrity Barn" thing?

40:28.000 --> 40:30.731
No, no, that's that guy,
that, uh, "Bro Show" guy.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.927
That's it!
That's it!

40:32.080 --> 40:34.447
' Hey! yo!
- Women: "Bro Show"!

40:34.600 --> 40:36.568
- Oh. my God!
- What's up?

40:36.720 --> 40:38.245
Our husbands
totally love that show.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.289
Except for Margaret's,
but he's bi, though.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.444
Fuck off, Nancy.
He is not bi.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.931
Hey, come have a shot with us.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.890
- I'm just getting a nightcap. I'm good.
- Oh, come on!

40:48.040 --> 40:49.849
Tequila! Tequila!

40:50.000 --> 40:51.286
- Come on.
- Look, here he comes.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.284
Nancy's divorce is final.
It's Carol's birthday.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.771
- We're celebrating.
- Mm-hmm.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.604
Just a little one.
Come on.

40:57.760 --> 41:01.082
Let's celebrate!
Cheers to the brew.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.891
I must be really loaded 'cause these
are actually starting to taste good.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.088
You guys aren't driving tonight,
are you?

41:06.240 --> 41:07.844
Oh, hell, no.
We got a suite.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.082
Does it look like we drive?

41:10.240 --> 41:12.641
You're taller than you look
in person.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.609
- Thank you.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

41:14.760 --> 41:16.728
How about your buddy
Jack Taylor?

41:16.880 --> 41:19.247
- Now, that guy is killing it, right?
- Oh, my God.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.687
- He must be so rich.
- No, you must fucking hate him.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.569
No, why does everyone
think that?

41:23.720 --> 41:26.007
I love the guy.
I mean, I'm thrilled.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.924
- Okay.
- I am, I'm thrilled.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.320
I am.
He's a friend.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.369
- I'm happy for him.
- Uh-huh, yeah, you know what?

41:31.520 --> 41:34.171
Hey, Carol, if you were thin
and rich, I'd hate you.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.129
Well, we don't have to worry
about that.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.807
Oh, fuck you, Janet.
Fuck you.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.122
Whoa!

41:42.280 --> 41:44.760
- Bruce: Okay.
- Easy, tiger. Don't get jumpy.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.127
What channel was that show on?
I haven't heard of it.

41:47.280 --> 41:50.204
It wasn't on QVC, Margaret,
so how the fuck would you know?

41:50.400 --> 41:54.564
Oh, my God, I'm so fucking psyched
to be divorced!

41:54.720 --> 41:57.121
About time! It's about time.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.529
I haven't been with another man
since I was 19.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.683
- Not so sure about that.
- Excuse me.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.844
Well, intercourse, anyway.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.083
19 couldn't have been
that long ago, right?

42:11.240 --> 42:14.483
- I mean, look at you.
- Oh, my God, so sweet.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.883
20 fucking years.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.324
Um...

42:21.480 --> 42:23.482
I wanna suck your dick.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.846
Me, too.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.445
What?

42:31.880 --> 42:34.645
- I mean, I want that for us.
- Oh.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.087
Hey, hey, another round of shots,
please. Come on.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.362
You know what? Nancy and I
are gonna head up to my room.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.682
I'm gonna give her a tour
of my minibar.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.650
Oh, is that what you call your cock?

42:44.800 --> 42:47.485
- She's funny.
- "Minibar."

42:47.640 --> 42:49.847
All right, ladies,
enjoy your evening.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.088
I'm gonna suck his dick.

42:55.480 --> 42:57.608
Bruce:
Are you okay in there?

42:58.600 --> 43:01.046
Yep, I'm good.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.409
You need-- you need--
so you want some help in there?

43:06.240 --> 43:09.608
I can get something from the minibar.
Do you want a Pepsi or something?

43:09.760 --> 43:12.923
No. No, I'm okay.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.924
I'm gonna be ready
in just a minute.

43:16.080 --> 43:19.289
Are you-- is that a lighter?

43:19.440 --> 43:21.920
Are you-- are you smoking?

43:22.080 --> 43:24.606
Yeah, just one.
it helps to settle my stomach.

43:24.760 --> 43:27.764
Okay, no. No, no, no.
Put the cigarette out right now.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.604
- What?
- Cigarette out.

43:29.760 --> 43:32.445
Sweetie, don't worry.
I'll finish your fucking blowjob.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.251
I need you to put the cigarette out
right now.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.731
- Throw it in the toilet.
- Oh, my God.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.968
You totally sound
like my ex-husband.

43:39.120 --> 43:40.724
Just fucking throw it
in the toilet right now.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.041
Just put it out right now.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.123
Relax.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.805
I only smoke when I drink.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.849
What are you,
the fucking Surgeon Admiral?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.809
I don't give a shit
about your health, sweetie.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.928
I need the cigarette out
right now.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.003
Fuck you, asshole.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.571
<i>I..</i>

43:55.720 --> 43:57.643
I'm sorry.
I take that back.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.962
I don't-- I don't mean it.
I care about you.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.201
You do?

44:01.360 --> 44:02.805
I do, I do, I do.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.485
Could you just-- I'm sorry.

44:04.640 --> 44:07.769
Just-- just put the cigarette out
and come on out.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.126
You really do?

44:09.280 --> 44:11.487
I do care about you.
ls the cigarette in the toilet?

44:11.640 --> 44:12.926
Tell me one more time.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.082
- I care about you.
- Mm.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.891
And I care about your health.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.202
And just come on out.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.171
Okay. Whew!

44:24.320 --> 44:25.924
- Now where were we?
- Oh, no, no, no.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.684
No, no.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.002
- You've got--
- Are you fucking crazy?

44:30.160 --> 44:32.401
- We got the towels in here.
- Oh, my God.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.523
- It's a--
- Why do I always find the crazy ones?

44:34.680 --> 44:36.762
- I don't even get it.
- We have a cloth shower curtain.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.968
- You're an asshole!
- Hey, listen, don't go.

44:39.120 --> 44:41.122
Not the robe!
Don't take the robes.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.527
They charge for the robes.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.644
Fuck!

45:00.520 --> 45:03.251
Fuck!Fuck.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.209
Fuck.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.245
Shit.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.489
Oh, my God,
it's "Bro Show"!

45:16.640 --> 45:18.483
Yo, I'm first class
with "Bro Show"!

45:18.640 --> 45:21.564
Uh, I'm pushing on to coach.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.131
You're not going to coach, man.

45:23.320 --> 45:26.051
Stop fucking with me.
I watched you in college.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.481
We would get high.
We would watch "Bro Show."

45:28.640 --> 45:29.721
Sit your ass down, man.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.405
It's gonna be
the best fucking flight ever.

45:31.560 --> 45:35.087
Doctor's orders.
No leg room, no free booze.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.083
He-- he said it.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.083
I'll see you on the way out,
though.

45:39.240 --> 45:42.767
Man!
My boys are gonna freak.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.965
Bruce:
So, let me get this straight.

45:47.120 --> 45:49.248
You just stand there and read?

45:49.400 --> 45:52.085
Yep. That's why it's called
a reading.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.242
I mean, you're 17.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.801
You're a genius.
I- it's not that impressive.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.928
If I read,
that'd be a big deal.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.161
- I have a disability.
- Okay.

46:00.360 --> 46:03.204
You ever think about
getting back in the game?

46:03.400 --> 46:06.449
- Mixed martial arts?
- No. Dating.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.681
I don't know about that.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.444
I'm putting your profile
on Match.com.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.602
You don't think I'd get enough hits
on Christian Mingle?

46:11.760 --> 46:14.889
"DWM with a sharp wit
and a heart of gold

46:15.080 --> 46:18.323
who can build or fix anything
seeks SWF

46:18.480 --> 46:20.005
for a romantic second act

46:20.160 --> 46:23.004
that will prove
F. Scott Fitzgerald wrong."

46:23.160 --> 46:24.605
Bruce:
How about this?

46:24.800 --> 46:27.644
"Divorced white male
seeks Asian teen

46:27.840 --> 46:30.684
to honor his request
to die alone."

46:30.840 --> 46:34.003
- I wanna post this.
- I don't know.

46:34.160 --> 46:36.561
I can't see-- I don't have time
for a relationship

46:36.720 --> 46:39.803
unless it's with that security guard
at LAX, you know.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.169
'Cause her thing is "take your
shoes off, empty your pockets."

46:43.360 --> 46:45.886
Actually,
it's a lot like being married.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.570
I knew I'd find you here.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.848
I got a Range Rover!

46:55.040 --> 46:57.486
Harper's dad
got her a Range Rover?!

46:57.640 --> 47:00.928
Oh, my God!
What the heck?

47:01.080 --> 47:03.606
God! This is amazing!

47:03.760 --> 47:04.886
Let's go.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.769
Bye. Dad!

47:15.880 --> 47:20.044
- Bruce: Baby Doll.
- Baby doll! This is it.

47:20.200 --> 47:24.285
This is the one-- off the road
and straight to syndication.

47:24.480 --> 47:25.641
That's the kind of money, boy.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.723
That's the spigot
that never shuts off.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.325
Great.
What's the show?

47:29.480 --> 47:32.450
Baby Doll, please come
in the pool with us?

47:32.600 --> 47:33.681
Bless your heart.

47:33.840 --> 47:36.161
I'm talking with the guy
that helped buy the pool.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.731
You know "Close Quarters"?

47:37.880 --> 47:40.884
The piece of shit about a family
that lives in a submarine?

47:41.080 --> 47:43.321
No, that hit piece of shit on NBC.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.244
They're adding
a new character--

47:45.400 --> 47:47.084
"Gus, the maintenance man."

47:47.240 --> 47:48.571
Single-cam or multi-cam?

47:48.760 --> 47:50.444
Single, multi--
who gives a shit?

47:50.600 --> 47:52.409
I told them you are offer only.

47:52.560 --> 47:55.450
- Good. What was their offer?
- They laughed.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.928
But then I said,
"We'll do a chemistry test."

47:59.080 --> 48:00.605
All right, when's that?

48:00.760 --> 48:02.046
Well, that didn't fly, either.

48:02.200 --> 48:05.443
But I told them you don't go
to the producer session.

48:05.600 --> 48:07.568
You go straight to the studio.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.087
Okay, so you got me
an audition?

48:10.280 --> 48:12.089
You're a fucking magician,
Baby Doll.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.361
No, no, no.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.522
I don't send you
to any cattle call.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.842
You cut in line.
You're in the finals.

48:18.040 --> 48:21.408
You're in the front.
It's basically a layup.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.244
You know, like a--
like a formality.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.444
Why?

48:27.600 --> 48:30.126
Because I never stop
working for you.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.805
That's why, buddy boy.

48:31.960 --> 48:34.850
In fact, I'm going right back
to work now for you.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.651
Speak to you later.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.802
But first...

48:39.960 --> 48:43.567
time to visit the girls.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.802
I love show business.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.167
- Hey.
- Man: Oh, Bruce. Good to see you.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.646
Been a long time, Jeff.

48:50.800 --> 48:53.406
- Uh, Jeffrey.
- Jeffrey.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.766
It's "Brucery."

48:54.920 --> 48:57.924
Oh, I see what you did there.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.849
Ahem.
So-- oh.

49:00.040 --> 49:04.204
Um, okay.
You're gonna sit for this scene?

49:04.360 --> 49:05.691
Oh, you want it standing up?

49:06.680 --> 49:08.967
I'll do it sta-- I-- standing's fine.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.531
I just thought
'cause the chair was here.

49:10.680 --> 49:13.160
It's an out-of-the-box choice.
If you want to go with it, just--

49:13.320 --> 49:16.164
I-- I figured with the chair there,
you just wanted--

49:16.320 --> 49:18.527
- Yeah, whatever works for your acting.
- No, I'll stand up.

49:18.720 --> 49:19.926
Okay, great.
You set to go, then?

49:20.080 --> 49:23.050
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Here we go.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.882
Gus, it's good to have you
aboard.

49:27.040 --> 49:29.441
It's great to be on board,
Mrs. Waterman.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.762
Please, call me Marina.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.606
You know, after 25 years
of working on Wall Street,

49:35.760 --> 49:37.922
I never thought
I'd be doing maintenance

49:38.120 --> 49:40.726
on a moth-balled submarine
in Long Beach.

49:40.880 --> 49:44.362
All the talk in the world's not gonna
fix that leaky torpedo hatch.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.204
Are you telling me
my fly's open?

49:48.040 --> 49:50.884
No, we actually have
a leaky torpedo hatch.

49:51.040 --> 49:54.203
Speaking of torpedoes,
Mrs. Waterman,

49:54.360 --> 49:57.364
that button on your blouse
is begging for mercy.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.524
Oh, is it humid in this submarine,
or is it just me?

50:00.720 --> 50:03.371
Oh, Mrs. Waterman.

50:03.560 --> 50:06.245
H-hold on.
Can I just stop for one second?

50:06.440 --> 50:09.489
The script's really funny,
but it's weird, right?

50:09.640 --> 50:11.290
Doing it with a--
with a guy?

50:12.320 --> 50:15.051
Listen, we've had over 15 people
in here already for this today,

50:15.240 --> 50:17.481
and nobody else
had a problem, so...

50:17.640 --> 50:19.210
Uh, wait.
Am I 15 or 16?

50:19.360 --> 50:20.805
Uh, you're number 16.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.082
Would you like to try it again
from the top?

50:24.240 --> 50:26.208
I'd like to try it again
without the bottom.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.010
Michael:
Houston.

50:28.160 --> 50:30.367
Oh, Houston always sucked.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.842
Houston just passed LA--
worst air quality in the country.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.604
Yeah, thanks to you
and your pussy friends

50:35.800 --> 50:37.962
with their Priuses,
we're not number one anymore.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.201
Nice going.

50:39.360 --> 50:40.725
Hey, didn't you
just play Houston?

50:40.880 --> 50:41.927
Yeah. A guy fell out.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.048
They called in a favor.
I was trying to help him out.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.771
And anyway,
I got this new bit that kills.

50:46.920 --> 50:49.605
Have you ever noticed
how many pharmaceuticals

50:49.760 --> 50:52.604
would just make great names
for black kids?

50:52.760 --> 50:54.649
"Norethindrone...

50:54.800 --> 50:58.407
get your ass on this porch
at the count of--

50:58.560 --> 51:00.244
don't make me come
off this porch."

51:00.400 --> 51:02.721
"Norethiserone! Norethiserone!

51:02.880 --> 51:05.121
I think he knocked him out.
Norethiserone!

51:05.280 --> 51:06.691
Wake up, baby.
It's Mama."

51:06.840 --> 51:09.764
"Esperol! Esperol!

51:09.960 --> 51:11.166
ESperol!

51:11.320 --> 51:15.291
They hog-tied you 'cause you didn't
listen to the policeman.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.966
Can he hear me
through this plate glass?"

51:18.120 --> 51:21.442
"Lathenedestrol,
this is your mama.

51:21.640 --> 51:25.122
Don't run from me.
Don't run from me.

51:25.280 --> 51:28.568
Don't run from me!
Lathenedestrol!"

51:30.080 --> 51:32.481
Where do you come up
with all the drug names?

51:32.640 --> 51:34.608
Well, most of the drugs,
I'm taking.

51:36.080 --> 51:38.526
Oh, also
the Teddy Pendergrass bit.

51:38.680 --> 51:41.081
- What's that?
- Teddy Pendergrass, a black man.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.327
He's a singer.

51:42.480 --> 51:45.370
He was quite popular
just 31 short years ago.

51:45.520 --> 51:48.729
He was what we call
"violently heterosexual."

52:50.600 --> 52:52.125
What's going on
with "Milk Chocolate"?

52:52.280 --> 52:53.361
He got seven episodes
ordered.

52:53.560 --> 52:57.246
- It's mid-season.
- It's on the air.

52:57.440 --> 53:00.205
- No way.
- The pilot was really funny.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.811
You saw the pilot?

53:01.960 --> 53:04.008
 I guess my DVD
got lost in the mail?

53:04.200 --> 53:05.804
You could've just gotten
a share file?

53:05.960 --> 53:07.121
Bruce: Fuck.

53:07.280 --> 53:09.203
This just keeps getting better.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.408
- You couldn't send me a file?
- Why?

53:11.560 --> 53:13.085
So you'll have
more fuel for your

53:13.240 --> 53:16.562
"this is why everyone's stupid,
the networks are retards" fire? No.

53:17.560 --> 53:21.326
TV executives seem pretty dedicated
to make sure that fire never goes out.

53:21.480 --> 53:23.847
It's like the eternal flame
at JFK's grave,

53:24.000 --> 53:28.403
except for JFK's grave is funnier
than a network sitcom.

53:29.680 --> 53:31.409
No offense, Phil.

53:33.680 --> 53:36.524
- Bruce: Baby Doll.
- Baby doll!

53:36.680 --> 53:38.284
I've got great news for you.

53:38.480 --> 53:39.891
Uh, let me guess.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.566
This one's about a family
that lives in an MRI tube?

53:44.360 --> 53:47.762
I have the guy who supplies
all the outdoor furniture

53:47.920 --> 53:50.446
for Pottery Barn,
Restoration Hardware,

53:50.600 --> 53:53.490
Crate and Barrel,
and he thinks you're hysterical.

53:53.640 --> 53:54.721
And affordable.

53:54.880 --> 53:59.204
And he wants you to do
their entire convention here in LA.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.931
<i>So you got me
a one-tighter 'm town'?</i>

54:02.080 --> 54:04.082
Listen, this corporate circuit
is big time.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.321
This could be
just the beginning.

54:05.480 --> 54:09.326
Listen, Baby, I'm in no mood to talk
to some asswipe from IKEA.

54:09.480 --> 54:10.811
Burt, go ahead.

54:10.960 --> 54:13.645
Uh, actually IKEA makes
prefab entertainment units.

54:13.800 --> 54:16.121
We manufacture
premium outdoor furniture.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.805
I’m-- I'm sorry, I didn't--

54:17.960 --> 54:20.122
it's customary
for an agent to tel

54:20.280 --> 54:23.124
Baby, tell me when
he's on the line next time, please.

54:23.320 --> 54:25.721
Burt: I would like it
a little personalized,

54:25.880 --> 54:28.451
so let me give you some background
on my coworkers, okay?

54:28.600 --> 54:31.524
- You got a pen?
- Um, no, but I can grab one.

54:31.680 --> 54:32.920
Hold on.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.322
All right, shoot.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.962
Burt: When you run a company
that sells furniture,

54:40.120 --> 54:42.009
you're literally a chair man.

54:42.160 --> 54:46.324
Well, that would make me
the chairman of the board.

54:47.720 --> 54:50.326
Okay, you don't have to laugh,
but it would-- it wouldn't hurt.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.926
And, you know, come your review
at the end of the year,

54:53.080 --> 54:54.730
it could make
a major difference.

54:54.880 --> 54:56.370
Hey, sweetheart.
How are ya?

54:56.560 --> 54:58.881
- What else have we got?
- Hi. Remember me?

54:59.040 --> 55:00.690
Yes, I-- I do.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.444
From, um...

55:02.600 --> 55:06.161
from the club in,
uh-- in Buffalo.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.441
No.

55:07.600 --> 55:10.001
- Uh, Houston, right?
- Mm-mm.

55:10.200 --> 55:13.124
Rooster T. Feathers,
San Francisco.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.487
Boston. Sarah.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.689
- Oh, New Hampshire.
- That's right. "Live Free or Die."

55:18.840 --> 55:20.330
Are you stalking me?

55:20.480 --> 55:22.005
If you're stalking me,

55:22.160 --> 55:24.083
you're doing a horrible job
of stalking me.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.481
- Do you know how to stalk at all?
- No, no.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.927
You can't take long breaks
in between stalking.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.809
I'm supposed to know you
immediately.

55:30.960 --> 55:33.042
No, my boss asked me
for recommendations

55:33.200 --> 55:34.725
for entertainment
for our company retreat,

55:34.880 --> 55:38.168
and I suggested that guy
from that crap TV show

55:38.320 --> 55:39.606
my husband
used to make me watch.

55:39.760 --> 55:42.764
Your husband
obviously has fantastic taste.

55:42.920 --> 55:45.241
Had great taste.
He passed away.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.480
I'm sorry to hear that.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.404
Oh, it's okay.
It's been a while now.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.688
It does explain
where my fan base went, though.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.568
So, you work with these people,
then, right?

55:55.720 --> 55:57.245
Yeah, I'm the head
of northeast sales.

55:57.400 --> 56:00.404
Good, because your boss--

56:00.560 --> 56:01.925
Burt.

56:02.080 --> 56:03.730
He gave me, like,
a little rundown.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.206
He wanted to do, like,
a roast thing.

56:05.360 --> 56:08.250
And I wrote it down,
but I don't have it.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.606
I'm just doing 12 minutes.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.928
Maybe you could give me some info
on some of these people.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.411
Like, I wanna give...

56:13.560 --> 56:15.608
- Bud.
- ...Burt his money's worth.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.125
Sure. Mm-hmm.

56:17.280 --> 56:18.930
Do you have something
to write with?

56:19.080 --> 56:20.764
Here you go.

56:20.920 --> 56:24.288
Okay, this guy has been
a major Hollywood star

56:24.480 --> 56:26.448
for well over 20 years.

56:26.600 --> 56:29.444
You got to love him
from the "Bro Show" and--

56:29.600 --> 56:30.965
oh, uh, what's the one
I love him from?

56:31.120 --> 56:34.681
Shoot. Where the celebrities,
they raise the barns or something.

56:34.840 --> 56:37.161
- "Celebrity Barn Raising."
- "Celebrity Barn Raising."

56:37.320 --> 56:39.322
That's crazy.
So let's-- let's give a big hand

56:39.480 --> 56:41.721
for tonight's entertainment,
Bruce Madsen.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.325
Bruce, come on up here,
buddy.

56:46.120 --> 56:47.451
Burt: Good to see you, man.
Thank you.

56:47.600 --> 56:49.125
Big hand for your boss-- Burt.

56:49.280 --> 56:53.171
Come on, he's paying for not only
the chicken, the fish,

56:53.320 --> 56:56.324
and the spaghetti,
but medical and dental as well.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.606
A hell of guy.

56:57.760 --> 57:00.764
Uh, we got Vince Stevens.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.287
Vince, are you out there?
Hey, buddy.

57:03.480 --> 57:05.482
What?
Are you flying solo tonight?

57:05.640 --> 57:08.883
With that beautiful redheaded filly
3,000 miles away?

57:09.040 --> 57:10.804
If I had a beautiful
redheaded bride like that,

57:10.960 --> 57:12.564
I'd keep both hands on her, boy.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.370
Let me ask you something
with the redheads.

57:14.520 --> 57:18.161
I've never been
with a beautiful young redhead.

57:18.320 --> 57:20.448
Does the carpet
match the drapes?

57:20.600 --> 57:21.761
You give her a call,

57:21.920 --> 57:25.003
'cause I guarantee she's getting it on
with the pool man right now.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.447
And, uh, Jenelle.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.250
Jenelle's here somewhere, too.

57:29.400 --> 57:30.686
Hey, Jenelle.
How you doing, girl?

57:30.880 --> 57:33.486
Look at you. Hey, I don’t judge,
you know, number one.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.324
L-l love lesbians.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.642
Just about every movie I see
is about lesbians.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.770
I watch a lot of Internet
these days.

57:40.920 --> 57:43.685
Top? Bottom? Do they have that?
ls everyone just a middle?

57:43.840 --> 57:46.127
'Cause if I was with you,
I'd have a definite preference.

57:46.280 --> 57:47.327
I'd be top.

57:47.520 --> 57:51.445
I would be a snow capped peak
on top of you, baby.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.728
I mean-- is she going
to the bathroom?

57:53.880 --> 57:56.326
How's it work with the lesbians
in the bathroom?

57:56.480 --> 57:57.527
Like, what is the code?

57:57.680 --> 57:59.284
You know what I mean?
There's got to be a code--

57:59.440 --> 58:01.090
Hey.
What are you doing?

58:01.240 --> 58:03.891
-  I'm roasting.
- You're roasting?

58:04.080 --> 58:06.048
You know, Vince is going through
a terrible divorce right now,

58:06.200 --> 58:09.170
and Jenelle
is a devout Christian.

58:09.320 --> 58:11.448
What happened
to that stuff I gave you?

58:11.600 --> 58:16.049
L-I wrote it down, but I didn't--
I didn't bring it with me.

58:19.200 --> 58:22.647
I can-- I know somebody rides
a recumbent bike or something.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.040
- I think I can make this up.
- All right, thank you.

58:24.200 --> 58:26.043
Get the fuck off.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.089
Uh, we're gonna-- we're gonna have
the raffle in just a minute.

58:28.240 --> 58:30.208
Uh, Bruce Madsen.
Bruce Madsen, everybody.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.926
Thank you. Thank you.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.206
- Burt: Sorry.
- Wow.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.967
There's a bar downstairs.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

58:38.120 --> 58:40.851
Bruce:
It's the least you could do.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.288
Sarah: Okay, first of all,
Jenelle and Vince are both assholes.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.330
He hit on me no less than 27 times
when he was married.

58:47.480 --> 58:50.689
And she is a chain-smoking
gambling addict

58:50.880 --> 58:53.531
who never stops talking
about Jesus Christ.

58:53.680 --> 58:56.001
All right, that explains them.

58:56.160 --> 58:58.527
But then there's me.
What did I ever do to you?

58:58.720 --> 59:00.370
You walked in here
totally unprepared,

59:00.520 --> 59:02.204
even though you're about
to make more in one night

59:02.360 --> 59:04.283
than those poor schmucks make
in four months.

59:04.440 --> 59:07.205
You couldn't do 20 minutes
of homework?

59:08.680 --> 59:11.524
All right, hold on.
You were just messing with me?

59:11.680 --> 59:13.444
I don't know whether
to kiss you

59:13.600 --> 59:16.046
or just hit you over the head
with a barstool.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.601
Wow. Well, if those
are my choices,

59:18.760 --> 59:20.808
please pick up
the little barstool.

59:20.960 --> 59:24.442
Well, I should head out.
I have an early flight out of LAX.

59:26.920 --> 59:28.570
You know...

59:28.720 --> 59:31.007
I do a little woodworking
myself.

59:31.160 --> 59:34.164
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:34.320 --> 59:36.527
Well, if you're ever
in the neighborhood,

59:36.680 --> 59:38.967
you can give me a call
and I'll give you a tour of the factory.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.088
I got a better idea.

59:41.240 --> 59:43.925
How about you and I
just blow this place

59:44.080 --> 59:47.766
and I take you
on a tour of my futon?

59:47.920 --> 59:51.641
So irresistible.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.768
Fucking Phil Spector.

59:53.920 --> 59:55.809
He fucked it up
for every horny guy in LA.

59:55.960 --> 59:58.042
Have fun
working your wood.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.568
So this is it?
Like, how do I get a hold of you?

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.041
My e-mail's
on the company website.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.930
I don't know the name
of the company.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.248
Oh, my God.
No homework.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.687
How'd you even find
the restaurant?

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.771
Hey, praise the Lord, right?

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.687
Mmm... huh?

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.411
Just drink it all in, baby.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.040
This is why I like to come up here
once in a while.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.363
It's beautiful, you know?
So serene.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.683
I don't need serenity,
I need a gig.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.083
What you need
is some perspective.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.844
Oh, you think
I need perspective?

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.407
Baby, showbiz
ain't what it used to be.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.210
We've all had to tighten our belts.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.330
Downsize. Sacrifice.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.847
I've heard enough.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.401
Bruce: Oh, yeah.
Everybody's downsizing.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.131
You downsize any more,
and this time next year,

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.806
there's only gonna be
a $500,000 car

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.371
sitting inside your house.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.086
You know how this whole thing
with Burt made me look?

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.641
Ridiculous,
like you always look?

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.451
- Like you do in that fucking wig?
- Really?

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.329
Getting a lot of pussy
with that Brillo pad, are you?

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.562
Listen, Burt was livid.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.405
It was like you didn't listen
to a word he said.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.485
I got some bad information
from a really sexy lady.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.211
Oh.
I hope you came twice.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.409
- I didn't even kiss her.
- Jesus Christ.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.289
You didn't get paid,
you didn't get laid?

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.044
You broke every rule
in show business.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.170
- I don't care. I got a better idea.
- Oh, good.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.450
I play a big local theater--
the Wiltern.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.564
The Wiltern?
The Wiltern has 2,000 seats.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.927
You don't have that kind of juice
anymore, baby.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.321
I'm an LA boy.
I'll pack 'em with my fans.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.931
Let me explain something to you.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.366
Even though he's
a dear, dear friend of mine,

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.443
I just can't call Goldie
and have him book you in the shows.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.090
He's gonna want to see
a guarantee.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.282
- Like what?
- Like...

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.284
"Can you get Jerry Seinfeld
to headline the show?"

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.284
- Thanks, dickhead.
- Baby Doll, I let myself in.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.728
Baby Doll: Hey, look who's here!
All right!

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.201
Bruce, you know
my newest client,

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.647
YouTube superstar
Jenna Marbles?

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.041
- Nice to meet you.
- Baby Doll: A billion hits, huh?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.565
A billion hits.
That's a billion with a "B."

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.285
Come here.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.125
Try and fuck me,
I will slit your throat.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.770
It'd be worth it.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.763
That's why the kids love her,
by the way.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.651
Get in the car.
We're going to lunch at the Ivy.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.848
Oh, isn't she great?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.490
Well, you got the code.
You know how to get out.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.211
So use the code and get out.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.965
Hasn't taken me to the Ivy
in 14 years.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.487
Car's going down,
how about you?

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.971
Jenna: You're going to fucking
get pepper sprayed.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.482
Tina: I don't understand.
If you're miserable on the road,

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.802
why do you keep
going out there?

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.086
First off,
everyone's miserable.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.005
I mean, you think roofers
and carpet cleaners aren't miserable?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.889
Well, you did those jobs
when you were younger.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.042
I know, and I was miserable.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.807
I mean, I guess the good part
about being a roofer

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.442
is that at least you're around
to see your daughter's violin recital.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.682
You're not at Hilarities
in Tennessee.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.004
The bad part is, of course,
you can't afford a violin, so...

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.248
Well, there's got to be a way
to do your job

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.289
that doesn't make you
unhappy.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.602
If I could just scrub my mind
of the '90s.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.841
What does that mean?

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.327
Well, if you would've
got a hold of me in 1987 and said,

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.324
"You can travel the country
and people pay you to tell jokes,"

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.926
I would've been like, "I'll be
the happiest guy on the planet."

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.210
So getting paid to travel and tell jokes
feels like a step backward?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.522
Feels like
three steps backwards,

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.405
but enough
about my career decline.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.523
What about you?
Have you picked a school?

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.808
I can be bored
by "Moby-Dick"

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.725
for 60 grand a year here in LA
to try to make Mom happy,

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.644
or I can save a bunch of money

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.404
and be bored by "Moby-Dick"
somewhere else.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.847
- Seems like a no-brainer.
- Yeah, it is.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.731
If I can go on the road,
maybe you can get off the road.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.680
Thanks, sweet pea,
but there is the house.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.604
Well, why don't you guys sell it?

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.081
Another no-brainer.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.924
No wonder your mom's
struggling with it.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.924
Bruce:
A lot of guys out there

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.287
are obsessed with
"Does she swallow?"

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.087
I feel like we're setting the bar
pretty high, fellas.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.288
My question is,
"Does she transport?"

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.363
Forget about swallowing,
'cause once I'm done with it,

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.531
I don't care what you do with it--
toilet, sink, potted plant,

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.762
somebody shorter than you.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.002
That's not--

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.208
I don't need it once I'm done.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.289
L- I don't get--
I don't get the obsession

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.442
with actually ingesting
the semen.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.364
Like, uh,
"Well, does your, uh...

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.887
your garbageman
just picks up the garbage?

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.765
He doesn't eat it?"

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.125
I mean, uh, I...

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.204
I-- you guys been watching
a lot of TV?

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.645
Sarah:
Yeah, I got your e-mail,

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.207
and I had this meeting
in the city, so--

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.284
Bruce: Well, it was nice to see
a friendly face out there.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.487
I've been
to your shows before,

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.048
so I knew there'd be plenty
of great seats still available.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.886
It is so sad that that face
is attached to such a mean person.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.691
How did you get into stand-up?

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.320
Well, the chief of cardiology
at Johns Hopkins

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.767
blackballed me.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.321
- And after that, I just--
- No, really.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.448
How did you become
a stand-up?

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.251
It's the same way every comedian
gets into stand-up.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.561
It's like we're fuckups.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.131
We're fuckups in high school,

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.328
and then we're fuckups
past high school.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.642
And then at some point,
you wake up and you realize,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.491
"I have one skil
it's making people laugh."

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.529
And now
that you've lost that?

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.045
I know you think I'm funny.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.202
- How do you know?
- It's not the money.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.921
I know you're not after
half of the 1/8 that's left over

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.924
after I pay my alimony
and Uncle Sam.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.570
What about all that TV money?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.768
Oh, that's long gone.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.001
Really?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.367
Oh, that's it? You're a golddigger?

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.684
♪ Dear heart... ♪

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.444
Bruce: You know, I guess
you just get what you want.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.364
If I wanted to be famous
and successful

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.888
like my buddy Jack Taylor,
then I would've been.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.651
I just would've done the work.
I just...

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.689
I just didn't do the work.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.042
Then why stay
on the hamster wheel

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.363
in the smoggy cesspool
that is Los Angeles?

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.603
I think it's just-- it's all I know.
It's just like repetition.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.247
- It's just-- it's a habit.
- Oh, like heroin.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.085
Yeah, except for the fun part.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.242
How far is your place
from here?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.081
Little over an hour.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.402
You promised me
a factory tour, remember?

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.369
The factory's closed
till the morning.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.648
I got a plan.
First thing tomorrow morning,

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.407
you'll make me some eggs
and we'll go take a tour of the factory.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.370
Are you pitching that you would
stay over after our first date?

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.410
- It's at least our third date.
- How is this our third date?

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.244
Well, we had Flappers--

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.563
your huge friend
physically assaulting me from behind.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.121
Back of my neck still smells
like Jagermeister.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.490
Date number two-- LA.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.728
Permanently banned
from the corporate circuit.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.245
And this is three.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.731
So we're three in.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.087
We're deep
into this relationship.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.611
And how would that work?

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.889
Just run by the hotel,
pack up my stuff,

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.441
be back in your Volvo
in five minutes.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.328
What the hell are you doing?

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.529
Hello?

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.808
Hey, did I catch you
before you left your room?

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.885
Yeah, I just--
I just got into my room.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.804
Are you still out front?

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.645
No. I panicked.
I'm sorry.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.087
I'll come get you
in the morning, though.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.368
I just trust myself more
during the day.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.805
Okay?

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.240
Bruce:
O-okay.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:38.288
Good night.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.488
Boston.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.001
Hey, Dana,
what's happening, man?

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.527
I heard you choked out
a heckler

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.251
in the "Jack Taylor" audience
with your mic cord.

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:58.841
Little bit of an exaggeration,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.800
but, you know, if I'm gonna look
like a stud, run with it.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.361
Audience warm-up?

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.761
L just got to get
off the road, man.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.604
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.285
Don't you want
to get off the road?

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:15.768
Not if it means no one will ever listen
to anything I say ever again.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.724
Let's face it.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.571
We stand onstage
with a microphone and talk.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:24.202
When is it someone else's turn?
Never.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.886
It's not that we're
the most important guy in the room,

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.362
it's that no one else
is the least bit relevant.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.688
And we like that.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.684
So, what you're saying is--
is if I wanted to get off the road,

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.524
I'd get the fuck off the road.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.170
Of course.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:40.441
Unless you're
a hopeless narcissist

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.602
whose parents never listened
to a thing he said,

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.560
taking his revenge on humanity
one shitty club at a time.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.848
You know, like me.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.568
Sarah: I think you're really
gonna like this.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.121
Roger worked really hard
to convert the barn.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.523
Yeah? All guys are proud
of their workshops.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.250
Some are better than others.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.926
I mean, it's like all parents
think their kids are cute,

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.651
but there's
a couple of dogs in there.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.808
My place back in LA
is pretty sweet.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.725
Biesemeyer fence,
oscillating spindle sander.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.810
Holy shit!

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.566
- You approve?
- It's okay.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.526
Sarah: I was the MBA and Roger,
he was the elbow grease.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.444
And I was gonna leave
Burt's company,

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.649
and we were gonna start
something together.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.962
Bruce: You could just find someone else
who can do what he did.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.168
You know,

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.800
it's harder than you might think
for a gal to find a guy

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.440
who can do radius work
on dimensional lumber.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.840
You kidding?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.970
"Radius work on dimensional lumber"
is my middle name.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.964
It's a little tough to fit on
on my driver's license,

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.202
but it's there.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.762
I like woodworking because
it's the exact opposite of comedy.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.967
How so?

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.851
Well, comedy's just about
tearing everything apart.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.761
And I'd like to start
putting things together.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.010
Oh.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.651
I think I could spend
10 hours a day out here.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.565
That's what my husband used to do.
It was awesome.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.529
It was awesome?
You didn't mind?

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.284
Hell, no.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.841
Women should love it
when their men are working.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.482
How about I put together a little
sandwich for you back at the house?

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.727
Yeah, you can go on ahead.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:35.043
I'll be there in a couple of years.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.884
It's weird
when you live in LA,

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.283
'cause everyone's like, "Could you
imagine living out in Podunk?"

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.528
And then you come out
to Podunk, and you're like,

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.170
"Not too shabby."

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.522
You're, by the way,
Podunk in this equation.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.682
Actually,
Podunk is the next town over.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.046
It's just a little bit bigger.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.369
I could see living in LA
if you were sentenced to live there,

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.205
but I don't know why anyone
would choose to live there.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.727
The business.
You gotta live there for the business.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.770
Oh, and the, uh, razor wire
around the freeway signs.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.803
I mean, you're not gonna
find that in Podunk.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.048
- That's LA, baby.
- Mm, that's true.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.771
Bruce: Whoa! What are you doing?

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.206
What do you mean?

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.283
What are you kicking the crap
out of the door for?

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.320
I'm sure it's okay.
it just sticks a little.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.289
Roger would've planed it for me.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.489
Oh, Roger would've
been wrong.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.849
No offense, but that--
that would've been a hack move.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.401
It's a rectangle in a rectangle.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.721
You gotta straighten it out.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.646
I could pop the pins on this bad boy
and have it fixed in a jiffy.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.691
- Let me see what you got.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:21.922
Well, thank you.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.965
Bruce: So, when did they start
putting wine in a bottle?

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.122
'Cause, I mean...

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.123
I'm familiar with the box.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.611
I understand the box of wine,

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.643
but this seems dangerous to me.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.847
This could break.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.651
Cut your foot on it.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.643
Got no--
like, you know, for me,

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.484
like, when I, you know,
get into a barroom fight,

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.689
it's like, "Boom!" I bust the box
right over the guy's head.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.569
Or I'll take a smaller box

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.688
and just break it over the counter
and go, "Who wants some?"

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.491
♪ I knew her long ago ♪

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.280
♪ Out on the edge
of broken time ♪

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:04.206
♪ I can see
clear into her soul ♪

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.601
♪ Through her
dark-colored eyes ♪

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.685
♪ We used to laugh together ♪

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.406
♪ At the strangeness of it all ♪

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.961
♪ Her laughter,
light as a feather ♪

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.966
♪ I can still hear it now ♪

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.282
♪ Ain't it funny 'bout love? ♪

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.721
Sarah: So, thanks for changing
your flight.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.087
I had fun.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.121
Sounded like you were having fun.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.288
I think the neighbors
heard you having fun,

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.283
and you don't even have
neighbors.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.363
Well, you know,
it had been a while.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.841
Well, you still got it.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.403
♪ Her mommy used to say
to me... ♪

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.130
This is probably
a little too early,

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.169
but, you know,
I'm not really interested

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.688
in seeing you once a year
when you play Flappers in Boston.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.882
Well, when I get back to LA,

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.522
I will not stop thinking
about your smile,

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.564
your body...

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:05.085
and that woodshop.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.526
Wow.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.887
Oh, man,
I miss that woodshop already.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.691
- It's so good.
- Sweet.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.801
Well, do you ever think about
the next 20 years?

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.601
Well, I didn't used to,
but now that I quit smoking,

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.046
I guess I should.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:26.131
Maybe a little companionship
and a little radius work?

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.764
That sounds really... nice.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.081
Sarah: Oh, come on.
You just miss your strip mall.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.562
This is my strip mall.
It's just more beautiful than yours.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.560
You got your banking, butcher,
post office- the whole shebang.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.802
I like the handicapped mule
parking myself.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.041
Oh, whoa!

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.009
My phone just sprung back to life.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.686
We must be entering
civilization.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.808
Wow.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.042
Got a lot of messages.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:02.050
Um... I'll just be
right behind you.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.528
Sarah: Hey.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.489
- Baby Doll.
- Baby doll...

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.290
where the hell have you been?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.771
I'm in New Hampshire.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.248
New Hampshire?
What the fuck's in New Hampshire?

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.801
They don't even have
a comedy club in New Hampshire.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.327
- I know. That's why I like it.
- Anyway, never mind that.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.289
This is it.
This is the big one, okay?

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.761
This is the one
that gets you off the road.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.410
I hope you're sitting down.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.321
This is beyond "fuck you" money,
this is "fuck me" money.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.603
- What is it?
- Howie Mandel wants you

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.651
to be the host of his new game show,
"Renaissance Man."

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.167
Now, this show is gonna be huge.
There's so much money,

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.163
this show's gonna syndicate
into countries

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.606
that don't even have
governments.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.364
This is legit?
This is serious?

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.242
Howie is dying to work with you,
but I need you out here ASAP.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.481
Okay, yeah.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.484
I'll be there as fast as I can.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.322
Sarah:
Okay, thank you.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.571
See that?
It only takes like two days

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.007
to fall totally in love
with New Hampshire.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.368
Oh, and you're gonna love
Christmastime.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.808
I can't wait to show you
a real white Christmas.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.125
Baby Doll: Hey! There they are, huh?
The dream makers.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.486
- Hi, fellas.
- Hey, Baby.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.246
Baby Doll: Hi, baby.
I think you all know

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.688
the funniest man on planet Earth--
Bruce Madsen, hmm?

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.962
Baby, tell me,
why can't Howie host this thing?

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.168
Howie is stretched too thin.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.448
He knows this is the guy
for the show.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.120
He handpicked this guy
for the show.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.521
Are you gonna fuck me on this?
Don't fuck me on this.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.364
Okay, I'm not gonna fuck you,
all right?

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.562
Let's sit down. Come on, now.
Come on, sit down.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.849
As I think some of you may know,
on "Celebrity Barn Raising,"

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.083
Bruce was
their highest-testing celebrity.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.090
I was tested
as being the most high.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.528
Isn't that great?
Come on, he always does that.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.409
He knows how to be funny.
He's got a million of them.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.210
- Howie: Hey, there he is.
- Ah!

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.489
- No, no, no, no.
- Hey ya, Howie. Ryan Barkley.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.369
He's new.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.046
All right, I don't have a ton of time.
Everybody sit down.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.089
L just wanted to drop by
and let you guys know

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.322
how much money
this major talent right here

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.811
is gonna make you guys.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.041
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.682
Bruce Madsen
is "Renaissance Man."

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.966
I created the show.
I know.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.090
He is that guy.
He's funny. He builds stuff.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.242
He's got screwdrivers
and cordless hammers.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:43.602
Al Howie,
all hammers are cordless.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.807
Hammers.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.122
This guy.
See? He is perfect.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.368
Even if I could do this show,
you're better off with Bruce,

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.488
'cause he's gonna make this
a huge hit.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.130
Howie, come on,
you got to stop by the show

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.601
at least once a week, you know.
Or we roll in a field piece with you.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.604
I am not on the show.
This is your host.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.603
Howie, Howie,
we all know he's funny.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.446
We know you're funny, but have you
ever hosted a game show?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.126
Howie:
Give them a little taste.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.328
Oh... like, host?

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.131
Yeah, a little patter.
A little game show patter.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.760
It's weird doing it here,
though, right?

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.207
You know what? I'll be the contestant,
you bring me out.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.762
"My name's Harold,
I am from Cherry Hill, New Jersey,

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.764
and I collect Elvis decanters."

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.160
Come on!

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.124
All right.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.323
- Microphone.
- Yeah.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.404
- Uh, Howie, this--
- Harold.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.971
Harold.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.481
Harold, this is weird.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.291
I'm just not in a headspace
to do this right now.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.920
Not in a headspace?
So you don't wanna dance?

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.647
- Not really, no.
- Come on, give 'em a little soft shoe.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.764
You know what? You don't have
to dance for these ass clowns.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.490
Thank you.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.245
But you're gonna have to dance
for me, bitch.

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.767
How the fuck are you gonna tape
five shows on a Friday

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.285
when you have a 102 fever?

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:02.642
You think I feel great every time
I show up to one of my three shows?

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.529
Well, guess what.
America can't know what I'm fee

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.011
want me to tell you something?
I'll tell you something,

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.844
and you keep this
amongst yourselves.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.607
There's an episode of "Deal or No Deal"
where I shit my pants.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.082
There is a point when I go,
"Two more cases,

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.844
and you can win $1 million."

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.929
That's what I said.
You know what I was thinking?

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.250
"Oh, my God.
I just shit myself on national TV."

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.482
I have to dance.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.211
That's the fucking game.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.125
And now
you're gonna dance, bitch.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.691
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:36.845
the "Renaissance Man" himself,
Bruce Madsen.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.766
Lights! Camera!
Shit your pants!

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.562
Welcome
to "Renaissance Man,"

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.408
where we are gonna find
and crown the ultimate male.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.326
Men, get ready to sweat,
ladies, you're gonna get wet.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.847
Our first contestant,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.240
- Harold...
- Yes.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.731
...from Cherry Hill,
New Jersey.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.730
Harold, are you ready
to play "The Fuse"?

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.042
- Yes.
- We have a rope hanging

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.761
from a Huey helicopter
over bin Laden's compound.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.410
You're gonna scooch up it,

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.250
we're gonna give you
a 10-second head start,

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:25.210
and then we're gonna
light the fuse.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.404
If-- and that's if--
you make it to the top,

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.211
you're gonna have to solve
a Rubik's cube--

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.568
Is that-- is that
one of our actual contests?

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.449
- No.
- I'm just making it up.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.568
You made that up?
Jesus.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.724
That is so much better than any
of the shit you idiots came up with

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.882
- in six months of preproduction.
- Write that down.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.243
He's a genius.
He is the "Renaissance Man."

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.367
Baby doll!

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.443
Huh?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.329
This is gonna be
your "Renaissance Man,"

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.689
and that show is gonna run longer
than "All My Children."

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.490
Thank you.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.491
Then the network
pulled the plug.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.247
They won't even air the episodes
he shot, those assholes.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.930
Wow.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.844
Go ahead.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.482
I'm sure this all
makes you very happy.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.166
No. Not today.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.006
- I just feel bad for you, buddy.
- Me, too.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.009
All right.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.527
Enough bad news for today.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.045
He did get
"Renaissance Man."

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.204
Can you believe this motherfucker
just won the lottery?

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.931
- Breakfast is on you.
- Yay.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.129
I think the greatest job in the world
might be game show host.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.521
Absolutely.
You bank five shows Thursday,

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:46.001
five shows Friday,
and you are done.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.049
Then you get to schmooze
with all the affiliates,

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.850
and they give you
lots of free shrimp.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.923
- And you're gonna get some pussy.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.411
Not "A-level" shit, though,
you know.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.131

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.529
The time has come

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:11.889
to crown
the ultimate male.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.805
Are you ready to make

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.769
of the most popular

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:20.970
competition reality show

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.329
The face of "Renaissance Man,"

ladies and gentlemen...

Welcome to "Renaissance Man."

Skeety skeet-skeet!

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:41.170
Tina: Dad, I'm really happy
you're close,

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.926
but you're not gonna be hanging out
here on weekends, right?

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.481
I'm not gonna miss
another one of your readings.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.290
You're not gonna do
a lot of readings, are you?

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.010
Oh, yeah. A lot.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.128
That's pretty much all they do
at this school.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.123
That's so funny,

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.089
'cause when I was
in junior college,

01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.447
we didn't read out loud
for other people's entertainment.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.807
We were
sounding out words.

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.128
How's your mom holding up?

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.760
You know, I think she's more upset
about selling the house

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.730
than about me going to college
3,000 miles away.

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.211
Sarah: All right.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.160
I think we got everything
you requested except for the vodka.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.721
Do you know what you could sell
vodka for to college freshmen?

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.925
You may not be
the only MBA in this family.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.162
"Family"?

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.482
I'm parked
in the loading zone.

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.967
Nice job, Dad.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.681
Thanks. I went with a dovetail joint
on the drawers.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.171
I meant Sarah.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.403
I really like her.
She's a good one.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.130
I knew what you were
talking about.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.368
This, I built.
Sarah--

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.762
she was perfect
when I met her.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.449
Well, I'm really happy
you found her.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.762
I'll be back.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.361
Just give me a few minutes
alone with my baby.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.249
I'll be right behind you.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.368
Tina:
Hey, Sarah!

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.203
Take good care of him.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.807
I don't think
anybody ever has.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.760
Oh.
You're such a good kid.

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:19.728

Alligators have to be confused

Like, I'd like to be at the next
alligator convention.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.768
'Cause alligators
have to be like,

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.843
"For four million years,
all we did

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.480
was slide up on the shore
of the riverbank

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.722
and every fucking villager

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.803
just pissed themselves
and scattered.

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.450
They all just went
for high ground.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.409
That's all we had to do.
We didn't have to do anything.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.528
We'd just slide up,
<i>catch</i> a little sun,

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.650
let a little gas go,
and watch all the crazy villagers

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.724
climbing palm trees
and running for the fucking hills."

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.043
Now they can't make it
to lunch

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.328
without some jackass
in cargo shorts

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.323
jumping on their back--

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:58.246
zip ties and fucking duct tape--
wrestling with them.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.007
Like, that alligator's gotta be going,
"What the fuck is going on?

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:03.241
Fucking nuts.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:06.006
All we do is yawn
for two million years,

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.606
and everyone would fucking die
of heart attacks.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.526
Now every jackoff
in fucking a Kangol hat

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.763
and cargo shorts
and desert boots

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.367
is diving out of a fucking fan boat
on top of me?

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.682
What the fuck is going on?

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.365
We gotta do something.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.921
We gotta eat
a couple fucking infants."

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.647
"Or don't eat them,
but we maim them.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.531
Like, whatever we gotta do.
Somebody's gonna have to--

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.409
somebody's gonna have to
take out an infant.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.961
This has-- this has
gotten out of control."

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.930
"12 Years a Slave" won Best Picture,
and everybody knew

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.730
that "12 Years a Slave"
was going to win Best Picture,

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.484
because nobody was gonna vote
against a movie

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.286
called "12 Years a Slave"
for Best Picture.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.005
Just not gonna happen.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.162
And in that sense,
I do think it was a little bit,

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.721
you know, not playing fair
with the title.

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.928
I think if you wanted to be
a little bit more evenhanded,

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.969
you could just as easily
call it, you know,

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.770
"The Slave That Got Off
Relatively Easy,"

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.524
like, historically speaking,
because".

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.524
Well, listen,
if anybody here tonight

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.842
has been a slave
for any period of time, I--

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.441
I just want to say that joke
is not meant to offend you.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.045
I want to say thank you
for your service,

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.043
though it seems
inappropriate.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.043
Um...

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.168
But the point is,
most of the time,

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.163
if you know your history,
that was a life sentence.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.722
So like, 48 years, or however long
people lived back then.

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.326
It seems unfair to those people
to spotlight this one guy.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:32.409
Like, if you brought
those people forward to today

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.608
and they saw this movie,
they'd be like,

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:37.366
"What the hell?
Where's my movie?" You know?

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.281
"I earned this times four,
or however long I lived back then.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.568
This has got to be like
the second-greatest injustice

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.610
that's ever happened to me."

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.285
The first being
actual slavery.

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.488
I don't know if everybody's
picking up on that.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.244
I'm worried about the kids.
This is why I'm concerned

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.925
about the kids,
because I got a buddy,

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.445
he's got some little kids,
and he invited me to come out,

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.090
watch them play soccer,
right?

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.765
Sounds innocent.
I got out there two minutes late.

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.763
I was like, "Hey, what's the score
of the soccer game?"

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.447
He goes, "Uh, listen,
we don't keep score here.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:10.769
Uh, all these kids
are winners."

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:14.410
I was like, "That kid's got
his jersey on inside out

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:17.769
and he's chasing a butterfly.
That kid's not a winner."

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.446
All these kids are winners?
A school district in Connecticut--

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.365
this is not made up--
has outlawed the use of red pen,

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.808
'cause they say red
is too aggressive of a color.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.930
Kids are gonna see the color red
and be reminded of their failure.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.487
Then when they get older,
they're gonna see red and be insecure.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.768
Man:
Boo!

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.200
Yeah, you can boo that.
Yeah, sure.

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.441
Like, here was
the grading system

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.241
when we were coming
through schoo "A, B, C, D, F."

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.767
Like, we skipped a letter
to make sure

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.809
kids knew they were failures.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.530
That's the thing is,
I do get excited

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.085
when I see
another little person,

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.130
because I'm not thinking
about this constantly.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.521
I'm not. I don't walk around
all day in my head

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.205
just, "I’m a midget,
I'm a midget, I'm a midget..."

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.767
Like, I don't do that.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.610
I know.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.001
If your life had a DVR,
you would have all

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.726
"15-seconds-ed" back
in that exact moment.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.370
"I got to do that shit again.

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.568
All right. Yeah."

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.371
But I do. I get--
I get really happy.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.490
Now if I see another dwarf
and it's a male,

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.644
if I see a male little person,
I don't know why this is,

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.083
but I have to fight him.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.607
And I don't know why.
Like, I don't want to fight him.

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.290
He doesn't want to fight me.
But we see each other,

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.330
we're like, "lt's go time!"
Like, why-- why is that?

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.041
Are dwarves like Highlanders?
Like, "There could be only one."

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.281
I don't know.
