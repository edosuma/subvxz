WEBVTT

00:04.533 --> 00:05.100
Tonight it's part three

00:06.633 --> 00:08.567
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

00:08.567 --> 00:09.767
- Suck my...
- Guys!

00:09.767 --> 00:11.133
- D---.
- For the love of God.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.700
- Because you spread
a load of sh-- about them.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.700
- That ain't evidence, Jax!

00:16.700 --> 00:18.633
- She was my bitch.
- So that's one example.

00:18.633 --> 00:21.100
- Can I get a word out
for just one second?

00:21.100 --> 00:22.166
- I had to go home
and tell my boyfriend,

00:22.166 --> 00:23.533
"Guess what;
there's a rumor"

00:23.533 --> 00:25.567
because of your ass,
because of your ass,

00:25.567 --> 00:27.000
because of your ass.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.633
- I get dumped in the end.
It was hard.

00:28.633 --> 00:30.700
It was really, really
----ed up.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.433
are you doing, man?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.567
- I honestly thought
I was doing the right thing.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.033
- Then why did you
hook up with her?

00:36.033 --> 00:37.567
- When your relationship
is this unpredictable,

00:37.567 --> 00:39.200
you should take contraception.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.600
Let me buy you a condom.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.467
- Do you think you care
about her

00:42.467 --> 00:43.667
a little more than a friend?

00:43.667 --> 00:44.734
- Oh, my--

00:44.734 --> 00:45.734
- It's how he treats
the people

00:45.734 --> 00:47.533
that he cares about the most.

00:47.533 --> 00:49.200
- Shut up, Kristen.
- Stop attacking everyone.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.033
- Oh, she's so dramatic.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.400
- I don't like when he--
- Oh, shut up, Kristen.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.000
- I'm talking, yes.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.734
Listen to me.
Just sit down.

00:57.734 --> 01:00.533
- Bye.
- We can't all just leave.

01:00.533 --> 01:02.567
- Hey, guys, guys!
- For God's sake.

01:02.567 --> 01:04.133
Why don't we all go
check on Lala?

01:04.133 --> 01:07.734
- The "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion concludes now.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.600
- ♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:11.600 --> 01:14.133
♪ This one's for you tonight ♪

01:14.133 --> 01:15.467
- Welcome back
to the "Vanderpump Rules"

01:15.467 --> 01:17.066
season six reunion.

01:17.066 --> 01:18.533
I'm Andy Cohen.

01:18.533 --> 01:20.100
Let's talk about

01:20.100 --> 01:22.100
a very surprising new friendship

01:22.100 --> 01:24.567
that has developed
over the past year,

01:24.567 --> 01:27.367
Jax and James.

01:27.367 --> 01:30.367
Jax, how did you go from wanting
to punch him in the face

01:30.367 --> 01:33.033
to finding him amusing?

01:33.033 --> 01:36.066
- I think it all started
the last reunion, really,

01:36.066 --> 01:37.500
because right off the bat,
he said just something

01:37.500 --> 01:38.767
that I--he said
something about Stassi,

01:38.767 --> 01:40.100
like the crawling thing or--

01:40.100 --> 01:42.166
I can't remember what it was.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.033
- Oh, shut up, Stassi.
Look at you.

01:44.033 --> 01:46.100
You came crawling back
from New York.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.633
"Please, please."

01:48.633 --> 01:49.767
funny today.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.567
- How is Jax my best friend
today?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.367
- I was in hysterics.
Whatever, man.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.433
- Well, they're actually
remarkably similar.

01:57.433 --> 01:58.767
- Oh, absolutely, to a tee.

01:58.767 --> 02:00.367
- They have a lot of qualities
that they share.

02:01.667 --> 02:02.667
- Oh, because
they're both so--

02:02.667 --> 02:04.400
the choices they make--

02:04.400 --> 02:06.667
- Definitely both a little
compulsive and needy.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.533
- Exactly.
- Loves attention.

02:08.533 --> 02:11.000
- Loves themselves.
- Yeah.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.667
- Can you write
something funny

02:13.667 --> 02:15.066
so those mother----ers
back at Sur

02:15.066 --> 02:16.533
wishes that they were us?

02:16.533 --> 02:17.734
- One, two, three!

02:17.734 --> 02:19.533
- You got to come over
to my house.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.600
I got a drum set now.
- I know!

02:21.600 --> 02:23.767
♪ ♪

02:23.767 --> 02:27.000
- James, Jax is 13 years
your senior.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Is he a role model for you?
- I wouldn't say--

02:31.000 --> 02:32.533
- I don't think I should be
a role model for anybody.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.000
- Yeah, but, you know,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.133
definitely hanging out
this summer was fun.

02:37.133 --> 02:40.133
- Lala, you seemed
a little skeptical

02:40.133 --> 02:43.700
about James and Jax's
friendship.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.166
What were you concerned
might happen?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.033
- Exactly what did happen.

02:48.033 --> 02:49.633
- I think that--

02:49.633 --> 02:51.567
Well, we all watched
the same show.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.033
I think we all know
what happened.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.000
- He's saying
that you ----ed Kristen.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.500
- I did say that.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.000
So I go to the pool.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.767
Kristen is out
in the pool area,

03:01.767 --> 03:04.133
and James grabbed
a bottle of tequila.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.567
Just them.

03:05.567 --> 03:06.567
- You think
they were hooking up?

03:06.567 --> 03:08.400
- Why, at 7:30 in the morning,

03:08.400 --> 03:10.734
would you be in a pool
drinking with your ex

03:12.433 --> 03:14.567
- I just don't see how
you can go through

03:14.567 --> 03:18.000
however many seasons or years
of not connecting with somebody

03:18.000 --> 03:20.433
and then be like,
"Yeah, we're bros."

03:20.433 --> 03:22.100
- Just like you did with Stassi,

03:22.100 --> 03:23.700
you ----ing bullsh---er.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.166
- You did with a lot of people.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.200
- See, and I feel
the opposite.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.066
I feel like I've been
completely honest

03:30.066 --> 03:32.467
that I don't feel like
I want to confide in cert--

03:32.467 --> 03:33.734
- Shut up. She called you
a whore for years,

03:33.734 --> 03:35.133
and now you're
best friends with her.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.467
- Stop telling me
to shut up.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.600
- Now you're best friends
with her.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.734
- No, I have a good time
with her.

03:38.734 --> 03:40.066
- Let her talk.
- Exactly.

03:40.066 --> 03:41.600
- Be quiet.
I'm speaking.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
The only thing that I did
was ask Stassi to help me

03:43.600 --> 03:46.066
plan an event,
and that's as far as it goes.

03:46.066 --> 03:47.734
- Yeah, but you do have
a friendship, yeah.

03:47.734 --> 03:49.600
- Well, yeah, now we do.
- Moving on.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.734
- All of you, I think that's
what he's trying to say.

03:51.734 --> 03:53.567
- Lala's friends
with everybody now,

03:53.567 --> 03:54.734
and she wasn't;
it's the same thing.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.734
- I want to talk
about something else.

03:57.734 --> 04:01.600
Stassi, how did the idea
of you event

04:01.600 --> 04:04.667
- I had heard
that this was something

04:04.667 --> 04:06.600
that they wanted to try out

04:06.600 --> 04:08.367
and they were looking for
extra help.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.633
I mean, I want to be like Lisa.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.567
I want to be a boss-ass bitch.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.166
- I always loved Stassi.

04:15.166 --> 04:17.734
I saw she had
a lot of potential.

04:17.734 --> 04:20.500
So I always thought that we
would do something together.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.500
- I want to just learn things.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.500
I want to be
really well

04:25.500 --> 04:27.467
She knows how to do everything.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.467
- Stassi, it seemed like
some of the gang

04:29.467 --> 04:32.767
didn't love the idea
of you being their boss

04:32.767 --> 04:35.033
or you bossing them around

04:35.033 --> 04:38.166
or you being in a position
of authority.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.633
- I think I was bossier before.

04:39.633 --> 04:42.567
I was so scared
to piss people off this time...

04:43.734 --> 04:45.767
- That I really tried
to just, like,

04:45.767 --> 04:47.500
treat everyone
with as much respect

04:47.500 --> 04:48.533
as I possibly could.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.400
- I mean, no one's ever
gonna boss me around,

04:52.400 --> 04:54.133
so it wouldn't have worked
anyways.

04:54.133 --> 04:55.600
- The reason why
it was frustrating

04:55.600 --> 04:57.600
is because we've all worked
at Sur.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.467
We haven't quit.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.000
- Yeah, she came back,
and she's proved herself...

05:01.000 --> 05:02.533
- And you hand her
a position of power

05:02.533 --> 05:04.100
when she should have had

05:04.100 --> 05:07.133
to waitress at Sur again
like the rest of us.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.600
And that's very fair.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.400
- You're upset.
You're upset.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.600
- Let's all be a team.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.367
- It's a little hard
to say, like,

05:14.367 --> 05:15.400
"Let's all be a team"--

05:16.533 --> 05:17.533
- I'm not talking to you.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.133
What did you see in her
to give her that--

05:22.133 --> 05:24.000
- Lala's still a hostess.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.367
- Okay, because that's what
she wanted to do.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.333
It's a position
that we could fill.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.033
She did help me, okay?

05:30.033 --> 05:32.400
So whatever she did,
I needed doing.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.433
And she did it, okay?
End of story.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.000
- She planned your event, Lala.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.633
How did she do?
Did she do the grunt work?

05:36.633 --> 05:39.033
- Like, she was my bitch.

05:39.033 --> 05:40.567
- Okay, so that's
one example.

05:40.567 --> 05:43.033
- Can I get a word out
for just one second?

05:43.033 --> 05:44.367
Thank you.

05:44.367 --> 05:46.700
Yes, this chick shows up

05:46.700 --> 05:48.567
an hour before I ask her to,

05:48.567 --> 05:50.033
is bringing in

05:50.033 --> 05:51.567
hundreds of flowers.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.700
Give credit
where credit is due.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.700
She made my job very easy

05:56.700 --> 05:59.700
and made the ambience killer.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.100
- Can you take those
out of the boxes?

06:02.100 --> 06:04.700
- My God.
This is amazing.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.033
- This looks amazing.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.667
- Oh!
- It's beautiful.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.567
- ♪ Let me know
if I can  with you, boy ♪

06:11.567 --> 06:15.066
♪ Boy, boy, boy, boy,
boy, boy, boy, boy ♪

06:15.066 --> 06:16.734
- Whoo!
Get it, Lala!

06:16.734 --> 06:18.600
- Is your song called

06:18.600 --> 06:21.066
"Let Me Know If I Can
You, Boy"?

06:21.066 --> 06:22.734
- It's called "Boy."

06:22.734 --> 06:24.533
- It's called "Boy."

06:24.533 --> 06:26.533
with you, boy."

06:26.533 --> 06:28.000
- Oh, "with you."
Okay.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.166
I want to switch gears
for a second.

06:30.166 --> 06:34.066
James and Lala,
was it about the pasta?

06:35.433 --> 06:36.734
- It isn't about
the damn pasta!

06:36.734 --> 06:38.066
Get over the damn pasta!

06:38.066 --> 06:39.600
Read between
the ----ing lines!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.166
It ain't about the pasta!

06:42.467 --> 06:44.400
It's not about the pasta!

06:45.467 --> 06:47.066
It's not about the pasta.

06:47.066 --> 06:48.467
- "It's not about the pasta"

06:48.467 --> 06:51.467
became the catchphrase
of the season.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.567
- Yeah, well, it was about
the pasta, partly.

06:54.767 --> 06:57.066
- Like, all right,
so I was just pissed off

06:57.066 --> 06:59.600
in the sense that I thought
she was, like,

06:59.600 --> 07:02.367
eating Raquel's pasta
for real at Sur.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.033
And then at the place,
you know,

07:04.033 --> 07:06.333
obviously, I drank
a little bit too quickly.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.633
I'm gonna get some shots--
double shots--of vodka.

07:08.633 --> 07:12.367
Also, I'm gonna do
a double shot of the bourbon.

07:12.367 --> 07:14.100
To getting drunk.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.100
Cheers, shot number two.
And let's go.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.100
- They're huge!

07:18.100 --> 07:19.467
- I'm missing one.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.367
- I remember that day.

07:21.367 --> 07:22.633
We were all drinking,

07:22.633 --> 07:25.500
and he and Logan started

07:25.500 --> 07:27.066
having a conversation

07:27.066 --> 07:29.100
that was going
a little bit south,

07:29.100 --> 07:31.333
and this was my boy.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.433
I would defend him
through thick and thin.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.533
So I brought up

07:35.533 --> 07:37.100
we ate Raquel's pasta,

07:37.100 --> 07:39.133
thinking he would be like,
"Oh,  off."

07:39.133 --> 07:40.667
Like, "You're such a dummy."

07:40.667 --> 07:42.533
- Instead, he took it--

07:42.533 --> 07:44.734
I mean, that was, like--

07:44.734 --> 07:47.633
- That's right.
Just infected all of us.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.667
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry, go ahead, Lala.

07:50.667 --> 07:54.533
- I was completely, like,
joking around.

07:54.533 --> 07:58.400
And then it turned into him
calling my man certain names,

07:58.400 --> 08:00.533
him discrediting--

08:00.533 --> 08:02.400
It was disgusting.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.367
with
your fat ----ing man.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.266
He's gonna get bored of you,

08:06.266 --> 08:09.000
and he's gonna be on to
the next young, pretty blonde.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.100
You ----ed the fat man
'cause he pays for your rent.

08:11.100 --> 08:12.667
- Stop.

08:12.667 --> 08:15.333
- And yeah, but yeah,
so it was about the pasta.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.533
So there you go.

08:16.533 --> 08:17.700
- It just validates
everything I say.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.667
The guy cannot drink.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.533
He should not really even have
a sniff of a sherry trifle.

08:22.533 --> 08:24.500
But, you know, one--
- A sherry trifle.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.633
- One thing I want you to--

08:26.633 --> 08:28.300
- No, that's disgusting.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.433
- Do we need--
- No.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.166
What's wrong?

08:35.166 --> 08:37.433
- I could tell, sitting there,
that she was getting

08:37.433 --> 08:39.467
more and more mad
and mad and mad.

08:41.567 --> 08:43.767
- Oh, she's so dramatic.

08:43.767 --> 08:45.500
I can't even take it.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.433
- It's so bad.
I don't remember it.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.400
- Xanax and alcohol.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.367
- Probably not.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.767
- Really bad.

09:10.066 --> 09:10.266
- Oh, Lord.

09:10.266 --> 09:10.600
- Oh, Lord.
- No, no, no, listen.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.133
"Oh, Lord."
- James, don't.

09:14.133 --> 09:15.600
It upset her then.
She got over it.

09:15.600 --> 09:16.734
Then she rewatched it,

09:16.734 --> 09:18.333
and that's when
she got pissed at you.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.734
- Shut up, Kristen.

09:19.734 --> 09:22.333
- I'm talking.
Yes, I was talking to James.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.700
- Yes, thank you very much.
- No, just sit down

09:23.700 --> 09:25.467
for a second.
Oh, for God's sake, why don--

09:25.467 --> 09:26.734
- Buh-bye, adios.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.567
- Well, I want you to understand

09:28.567 --> 09:30.734
how loyal this girl was to you.

09:30.734 --> 09:33.066
Did you not see
the interview bites

09:33.066 --> 09:34.533
when she was defending you,
when she was saying...

09:34.533 --> 09:36.133
- A couple times.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.467
- "If he goes down,
I am going down with him."

09:38.467 --> 09:40.500
And so you should go out
on a limb, really,

09:40.500 --> 09:42.100
to apologize to her about--

09:42.100 --> 09:43.600
- You should chase her in there
and apologize.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.100
- James, go check on Lala.
- Oh, my God.

09:51.033 --> 09:52.700
- Yeah, it's gross.
.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.700
- James.
- For real, for real, dude.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.500
That was really
----ed up sh--.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.433
If anybody said that sh--
about Raquel, dude, you...

09:58.433 --> 10:00.367
- But go if you mean it.
James.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.767
- Yes, I'm gonna go apologize.
Like, I want to apologize.

10:02.767 --> 10:04.433
I've been trying to do this
for--

10:04.433 --> 10:05.734
- Have an understanding
of how she feels.

10:05.734 --> 10:07.567
- Don't roll your eyes at it,
dude.

10:07.567 --> 10:08.700
- I'm not rolling
my ----ing eyes.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.100
- You just rolled your eyes.

10:11.367 --> 10:12.633
Honestly, it's not a smile,
okay?

10:12.633 --> 10:14.100
And secondly, I've already
tried to apologize.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.433
- Try harder.

10:16.734 --> 10:19.100
Come on; I'm looking out
for you, man.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.600
- I'll get the other girls.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.533
- We can't all, like,
just leave.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.000
What?
I'm just saying--

10:28.400 --> 10:30.233
- It's all right.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.500
- Well, listen.
No, just let--

10:36.500 --> 10:37.734
- People are dropping
like flies.

10:37.734 --> 10:38.767
- They've all got
to come back.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.100
And she's gonna come back.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.667
We're trying to get her back.
We'll get her back.

10:44.667 --> 10:45.734
We'll get her back.
- Okay.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.133
- Darling.
Okay, Katie, come back in.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.533
Lala, come back in.
- I am.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.133
- James has got--
- Just give me one second.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.367
- James is gonna apologize
to you.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.000
- I know.
I just need one second.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.533
- Come on.
You're a strong girl.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.000
- I am.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.133
- Is this because of
everything he said,

11:03.133 --> 11:05.633
or is this because of
the place you're in right now?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.533
- That was my best friend
who did that to me.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.433
- I know.
Well, tell him that, then.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.100
.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.000
- Come on.
You're stronger than that.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.567
- Look, can we just please--

11:15.567 --> 11:17.400
- No, no, no,
go back and sit down, please.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.033
You guys have got to
figure this out, okay?

11:20.033 --> 11:22.667
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Lala.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.433
- Thank you.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.133
- Well, why did you leave,
first of all?

11:26.133 --> 11:29.500
- Damn you, Andy.
Why you got to ask that?

11:29.500 --> 11:31.633
Um...

11:35.567 --> 11:38.767
- Stassi, switch places.

11:46.066 --> 11:47.467
- James...

11:47.467 --> 11:48.600
was my best friend,

11:48.600 --> 11:51.734
and I would never in my life

11:51.734 --> 11:56.734
want to tear him down,
want to tear his girl down.

11:56.734 --> 12:00.200
I just feel like
he really, really came for me.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.033
- I throw things in her face
that she knows is true.

12:03.033 --> 12:04.533
I call him "big, fat man,"
you know.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.600
"Big, fat Rolls-Royce."
Roll it up, you know?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.333
- Well, why can't you support
her and her relationship?

12:10.333 --> 12:12.734
- Because you can't support
something that's rotten.

12:12.734 --> 12:15.433
- Lala, how were you able
to stay friends with him

12:15.433 --> 12:16.667
after he said all that stuff?

12:16.667 --> 12:18.700
He's a hurt person.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.066
- I think there's a bit
of jealousy here.

12:20.066 --> 12:21.600
I really do.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.333
You've always had feelings
for Lala.

12:23.333 --> 12:24.467
I know you love Raquel.
- I don't have fee--

12:24.467 --> 12:26.000
I do love Raquel
and Raquel only.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.500
I don't have feelings
for Lala anymore, though.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.734
- Yeah, but it came from
a place of jealousy.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.633
- It is because, like,
maybe, like,

12:32.633 --> 12:34.100
it didn't work out
with you guys?

12:34.100 --> 12:35.767
- No, look, like,
when we were--

12:35.767 --> 12:38.467
- It's how he treats the people
that he cares about the most.

12:38.467 --> 12:42.367
- Shush, Kristen.
- James, be kind, please.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.767
- Why does Kristen
have to talk, though, about--

12:43.767 --> 12:45.467
- Stop attacking everyone.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.467
- She knows you very well.
- She knows you.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.033
- She doesn't really know.
- Well, she does.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.633
You were together
for a few years.

12:50.633 --> 12:53.433
- I think you care about her
a little more than a friend.

12:53.433 --> 12:54.700
- I don't have feelings
for Lala.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.500
I have feelings for Raquel
and Raquel only.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.433
- It's like the little girl
and the little boy.

12:58.433 --> 13:00.100
The boy pushes the little girl
because he doesn't like her,

13:00.100 --> 13:01.100
but secretly he likes her.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.100
- Mm-hmm.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.333
- Yeah, no, I've said that
numerous times.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.500
- Let me ask this.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.433
In Big Bear,
you got very drunk,

13:08.433 --> 13:12.533
and you were crazy flirty
with Lala in front of Raquel.

13:12.533 --> 13:15.000
- Real fun.
Real funny.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.767
Don't knock it till you try it,
right?

13:18.767 --> 13:20.767
I'm laughing with Lala.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.500
- I'm naked still.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.667
- I'm not looking at Lala.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.400
- You better not be.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.133
- I've loved you,
so you have to understand, Lala.

13:31.133 --> 13:32.467
I'm not used to it yet.

13:34.533 --> 13:37.000
- Obviously, drinking
way too much in Big Bear.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.133
I love Raquel, and I shouldn't
have acted the way I did.

13:40.133 --> 13:43.066
- You use her man against her.

13:43.066 --> 13:44.734
- I was there to talk to her

13:44.734 --> 13:47.066
when she was going through
all these, like, harder times.

13:47.066 --> 13:48.633
- He made me feel comfortable.

13:48.633 --> 13:50.700
He made me feel confident.
He made me feel--

13:50.700 --> 13:52.700
- Obviously, things changed
before my eyes,

13:52.700 --> 13:54.633
and then boom, it's just like
things are different.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.166
I wasn't believing it
at the time.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.500
You know what I mean?

13:57.500 --> 13:58.700
It's all, like,
----ing bullsh--.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.433
And that was a big mistake,
you know?

14:00.433 --> 14:03.033
I understand that what I said
was really ----ed up.

14:03.033 --> 14:04.700
- Did Randall see that--
- Yes, of course he did.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.033
- And I was literally
sitting there like,

14:07.033 --> 14:10.667
"Please, pray to God
that this does not air."

14:10.667 --> 14:13.767
And I even told James,
I said, "If it does air,

14:13.767 --> 14:15.433
"just so you know, like,

14:15.433 --> 14:18.100
our friendship's gonna be
different."

14:18.100 --> 14:21.433
And it is.

14:21.433 --> 14:24.367
I just don't feel safe
around him anymore.

14:24.367 --> 14:26.700
- If Lala broke up with her man

14:26.700 --> 14:28.433
and said she wanted to be
with you, would you--

14:28.433 --> 14:29.700
- Oh!
- No, no.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.066
I would be with Raquel
and Raquel forever,

14:32.066 --> 14:34.066
because I'm in love
with Raquel.

14:34.066 --> 14:35.734
And I don't think
she believes that either.

14:35.734 --> 14:37.433
Do you believe that, honestly?
- Of course I do.

14:37.433 --> 14:39.533
That you would be with Raquel?

14:39.533 --> 14:41.000
- Right, instead of you.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.667
- Of course.
- Come on.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.400
And that's vice versa.
We don't look at each other--

14:44.400 --> 14:46.567
- And I've said this
a million and one times.

14:46.567 --> 14:50.200
Besides my family, James was
the person that I would go to

14:50.200 --> 14:52.066
and to confide in.

14:52.066 --> 14:55.467
- What would it take for James
to be your friend again?

14:55.467 --> 14:56.667
- Yeah, I want to know.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.734
- Yeah, I would say so.

14:58.734 --> 15:01.700
The person that I'm with,
it's not just some guy

15:01.700 --> 15:04.066
that I'm like, "Hey, what's up?"

15:04.066 --> 15:06.333
I mean, you're attacking him...
- Yeah.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.033
- For certain reasons,
which, James,

15:09.033 --> 15:11.467
I don't know if you remember
last year,

15:11.467 --> 15:15.100
but we went for
people's physical appearance,

15:15.100 --> 15:18.367
and I am mortified for that.

15:18.367 --> 15:22.100
I called Katie "the blob,"
and I know it's ----ed up,

15:22.100 --> 15:24.500
but she's just blobbish.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.033
- Do I think that Scheana got
a nose job?

15:26.033 --> 15:27.500
Yeah.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.633
Do I think Katie's
a bit overweight?

15:28.633 --> 15:30.367
Yeah.

15:30.367 --> 15:32.033
- I was hoping
that you would learn with me,

15:32.033 --> 15:34.100
and you just didn't.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.367
- I'm not gonna be saying
those things ever again, okay?

15:37.367 --> 15:39.333
- I don't think you mean

15:39.333 --> 15:41.033
anything that you say,
James.

15:41.033 --> 15:44.500
That's why I have kept you
by my side for so long,

15:44.500 --> 15:47.600
because I look at you and go,
"You know what?

15:47.600 --> 15:51.066
He hasn't had
the easiest upbringing."

15:51.066 --> 15:55.166
You've taken on burdens
that someone your age

15:55.166 --> 15:56.667
should not have to take on.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.500
But when you're talking
about somebody

15:58.500 --> 16:01.100
that I love and adore
and care about, like,

16:01.100 --> 16:02.600
they're not gonna shake it off

16:02.600 --> 16:04.767
as easily as I'm gonna
shake it off.

16:04.767 --> 16:06.500
- Right.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.667
I get that 100%.

16:12.367 --> 16:14.500
Sorry.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.400
- And I forgive you.
- Thank you.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.266
- Nice.

16:22.266 --> 16:24.600
We'll be right back.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.600
When you told Brittany about
the job opportunity,

16:28.600 --> 16:30.667
you said there was nothing
holding you back.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.667
Were you prepared to take
the job

16:32.667 --> 16:35.066
with or without Brittany?

16:44.467 --> 16:45.033
- Welcome back to the

16:45.033 --> 16:45.433
- Welcome back to the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

16:47.433 --> 16:48.700
Jax, tell me this.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.433
The phone rings one day.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.700
There's a guy from Tampa
on the other end.

16:52.700 --> 16:57.433
And he offers you
a marketing position in hockey.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.567
- It didn't just happen
like that.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.567
It's been happening over time.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.433
I was going back home to Tampa,
because I'm a big hockey fan.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.100
- What was the job
they offered you?

17:04.100 --> 17:06.300
- It was more of, like,
in marketing and social media.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.700
- Do you have
a marketing background?

17:07.700 --> 17:08.767
- No, I have a two-year--

17:08.767 --> 17:10.700
Macomb College.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.300
Kristen, you know.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.700
- Studying out of college,
'cause I hated it.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.033
No, you don't party
at community colleges.

17:17.033 --> 17:18.300
You laugh at yourself.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.066
- When you told Brittany
about the job opportunity,

17:22.066 --> 17:24.700
you said there was nothing
holding you back.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.066
- No offense,
but I'm bartending at Sur.

17:26.066 --> 17:28.033
It's not like I have
an amazing job--

17:28.033 --> 17:29.467
- No offense,
but you have a girlfriend

17:29.467 --> 17:31.166
who moved to LA for you.

17:31.166 --> 17:33.600
- You even said that you weren't
even thinking about me.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.433
- She's not like an accessory.

17:35.433 --> 17:37.567
- I thought you were like,
"Get me out of here."

17:37.567 --> 17:39.333
- But you didn't ask her.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.333
- I really would have.
- But you didn't ask her.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.066
- Yeah--
- Because I assumed--

17:43.066 --> 17:44.333
- Yeah, but you can't
assume somebody

17:44.333 --> 17:45.667
who's just moved
across the country

17:45.667 --> 17:47.734
to give up their life
to live with you--

17:47.734 --> 17:49.533
- Were you prepared to take
the job

17:49.533 --> 17:50.734
with or without Brittany?

17:50.734 --> 17:52.400
- No, I wouldn't go
without her.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.400
I'm not gonna start all over
and--no, no, no.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.467
I just misread it wrong.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.333
I apologize.
I'm so sorry.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.433
- I actually don't think
you're being quite honest here.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.567
I think now you have

18:00.567 --> 18:02.100
a deeper appreciation
for Brittany

18:02.100 --> 18:03.767
because of
what you've been through.

18:03.767 --> 18:06.600
How you feel about her now
is very different

18:06.600 --> 18:08.700
to how you treated her then,
right?

18:08.700 --> 18:10.633
- Yeah, absolutely.
- There you go.

18:10.633 --> 18:12.500
- I said a lot of things
to you that I regret.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.767
And we don't have enough time

18:13.767 --> 18:15.033
to sit here
and all list things--

18:15.033 --> 18:16.633
- We don't.

18:16.633 --> 18:22.066
Jax, you did not know
Brittany's professional passion,

18:22.066 --> 18:26.500
which she attests
to having had shared with you

18:26.500 --> 18:28.433
many, many times.
- Numerous times.

18:28.433 --> 18:31.333
- Can you say
what that passion is?

18:33.767 --> 18:36.767
- Helping children
in a hospital.

18:36.767 --> 18:37.767
Children that have
special needs.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.600
- Yes.
- Yeah.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.633
- Working with developmentally
disabled children.

18:41.633 --> 18:43.367
- There's a good portion
of that whole summer

18:43.367 --> 18:45.133
where we--I didn't listen
to one thing she said.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.533
I talked at her.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.133
- But it sounds like
this is something

18:48.133 --> 18:49.667
that maybe she had been
telling you since she met you.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.533
- You have to listen.
- You're right.

18:51.533 --> 18:55.133
- Sandoval, do you think
the fire that was lit under Jax

18:55.133 --> 18:57.767
about this job had to do
with you and Schwartz

18:57.767 --> 19:00.000
moving forward with Tom Tom?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.467
- Possibly,
at least subconsciously.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.066
- At one point,
you were like,

19:04.066 --> 19:05.633
"I don't think he's ever
gonna actually go."

19:05.633 --> 19:07.333
- I can't believe
you took it seriously.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.600
I can't believe
y'all took it seriously.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.767
That was, to me,
the most amusing part

19:09.767 --> 19:11.266
of watching it back.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.467
- I didn't cry.
He cried.

19:12.467 --> 19:13.500
- I didn't cry!
- You cried.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.000
- Shut up!

19:15.000 --> 19:17.667
- Brittany, did Jax ever
show you a job offer?

19:17.667 --> 19:19.266
- You had him on the phone.

19:19.266 --> 19:20.667
You heard the conversation
to go to Tampa.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.400
- I did hear you talk
to him on the phone.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.166
- I'm not just making this up.
- No, I know.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.133
It just--
it sounded ambiguous.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.033
- You wanted people to say
that they were gonna miss you

19:28.033 --> 19:29.433
and they didn't want you to go
rather than say, like,

19:29.433 --> 19:30.700
"You're a piece of sh--."

19:30.700 --> 19:32.700
- 100%.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.000
- He's always been the boy
who cried wolf.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.567
Everyone can attest to that.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.133
- This is an annual thing
with Jax.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.700
- Usually, it's firefighter,
but this time--

19:39.700 --> 19:41.367
But this time, it wasn't--

19:41.367 --> 19:43.033
- He really did get asked
to do a job.

19:43.033 --> 19:44.433
I just don't know
what exactly that entailed.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.633
- If I could pick one job
I could do

19:45.633 --> 19:46.700
in the whole entire world,
this is it.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.567
You said, "This is
my dream job."

19:49.567 --> 19:50.567
- How am I gonna leave
my best friends?

19:50.567 --> 19:51.700
It's tough.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.033
Even though it's a dream job,

19:53.033 --> 19:54.700
it was guaranteed,
and it was this,

19:54.700 --> 19:57.033
I still had a little bit of,
like--I was scared.

19:57.033 --> 19:59.100
- 'Cause he's secretly
madly in love with LA.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.433
As much as you say you hate it,
you ----ing love it here.

20:01.433 --> 20:06.400
- I want to talk about
the finale party with Patrick.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.734
- Yes!
- This is so embarrassing.

20:08.734 --> 20:10.734
I could not sleep last night.

20:10.734 --> 20:14.600
I was so, like, shook
by the finale.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.600
- Lisa, it just seemed like
weird energy

20:16.600 --> 20:18.333
from the beginning with Patrick.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.734
- Oh, totally.

20:19.734 --> 20:22.033
He was--straight out the door,
he was kind of rude.

20:22.033 --> 20:23.467
- How surprising was it for you

20:23.467 --> 20:26.066
when he was talking
about your backside?

20:27.133 --> 20:28.467
- I liked watching you
walk away,

20:28.467 --> 20:29.600
to be honest with you.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.066
I still think you have
a good ass.

20:31.066 --> 20:33.333
Girl, when I saw it,
it was up.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.066
I like to see you leave, girl.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.700
- On so many levels,
that was wrong.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.467
One, it was the first time
I really met him.

20:40.467 --> 20:45.000
Two, it was in front of somebody
that was working for me

20:45.000 --> 20:46.433
and his girlfriend.

20:46.433 --> 20:48.033
- It's so bad.
It's so bad.

20:48.033 --> 20:50.033
- So, Stassi, were you, like,
drunk?

20:50.033 --> 20:51.633
- I was--I mean,
I couldn't even--

20:51.633 --> 20:52.767
I looked back on it--

20:52.767 --> 20:54.633
- She was apologizing
to Patrick

20:54.633 --> 20:57.200
right after he's talking
about Lisa's butt, right?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.367
- I couldn't form a sentence.

20:59.367 --> 21:00.767
"

21:00.767 --> 21:02.433
And he was like,
"Well, that's condescending"

21:02.433 --> 21:03.767
or "That's patronizing."

21:03.767 --> 21:05.700
- Xanax and alcohol.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.600
- Probably not.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.633
- It's really bad.

21:09.633 --> 21:12.567
- I actually had,
in my own place,

21:12.567 --> 21:14.633
I had to go and apologize
to him.

21:14.633 --> 21:16.100
And I started nothing.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.633
I just tried
to make him feel welcome.

21:17.633 --> 21:19.100
But look, you know,

21:19.100 --> 21:20.500
the proof of the pudding
is in the eating,

21:20.500 --> 21:22.066
and I think she's had enough.

21:22.066 --> 21:23.567
- Yeah.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.367
- Scheana, this year,
you were criticized

21:25.367 --> 21:27.033
for obsessing over Rob.

21:27.033 --> 21:29.633
Do you think you lost yourself
in that relationship

21:29.633 --> 21:32.500
any more than Stassi did
with Patrick?

21:32.500 --> 21:35.100
- I honestly, I haven't seen
all of the episodes,

21:35.100 --> 21:37.100
so I haven't seen
their relationship

21:37.100 --> 21:38.200
on the show this season.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.000
- Scheana, be honest.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.734
Do you fast-forward
through other people's scenes?

21:41.734 --> 21:43.400
- Yes, I do.
- You do.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.533
- I haven't had time
to watch all of them,

21:45.533 --> 21:47.667
'cause I have shows
Monday nights.

21:47.667 --> 21:50.133
So I've gotten behind,

21:50.133 --> 21:51.667
and then I had eight episodes
to binge

21:51.667 --> 21:53.533
in the last two days,
so I did fast-forward

21:53.533 --> 21:55.066
through a lot of
the last eight episodes.

21:55.066 --> 21:57.133
- Schwartz, you paid Patrick
more compliments

21:57.133 --> 21:58.533
in the first five minutes
of meeting him

21:58.533 --> 22:01.667
than you have to Katie
all last season.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.133
- Watching this back
and seeing

22:03.133 --> 22:04.500
the way he behaves,

22:04.500 --> 22:05.734
I wanted to punch the guy.

22:05.734 --> 22:08.000
- Stassi, you communicated
with him?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
- No.
- No.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.667
- Forget that guy.

22:10.667 --> 22:12.700
The good guy she's got now
is just such a cool dude.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.433
I mean, he's just cool.
I'm always like, "Where's Beau?"

22:14.433 --> 22:15.700
- This is why Kristen and I

22:15.700 --> 22:17.033
finally had to choose
the boyfriend.

22:17.033 --> 22:19.567
- Kristen and Katie set us up.
- Wow.

22:19.567 --> 22:21.500
- Thank you for that,
for helping her out.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.033
- He's a lot like Tom.

22:23.033 --> 22:25.367
- He's very much
like Schwartz.

22:25.367 --> 22:28.033
- Sounds like the new guy
is great.

22:28.033 --> 22:29.166
- He's friends with everyone,
so he, like--

22:29.166 --> 22:30.567
- Wow.
- Yeah.

22:30.567 --> 22:32.433
- Oh, yeah.

22:32.433 --> 22:34.000
- I haven't talked to him,
but he seems really cool.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.400
No.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.700
- He's a fun guy.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.433
- I need to not screw it up.

22:39.433 --> 22:41.633
- No, you don't.
You need to just be yourself.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.033
That's exactly
what you need to be.

22:43.033 --> 22:45.433
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.633
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.066
- You spread a bullsh-- ass
rumor once again!

22:55.600 --> 22:57.066
I'll apologize if you think
I should apologize.

22:57.066 --> 22:59.500
- Suck my d---.
- Guys!

23:11.200 --> 23:11.567
- We're back with the gang

23:11.567 --> 23:12.100
- We're back with the gang
from "Vanderpump Rules."

23:14.066 --> 23:15.734
I want to talk about Mexico
a little bit.

23:15.734 --> 23:18.467
Lala, tell me everything
about the baby bottle.

23:18.467 --> 23:20.033
- Bubba.

23:20.033 --> 23:21.166
That's your bubba.
I have a bubba too.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.533
- It's a bubba.

23:22.533 --> 23:24.333
I'm making my bub.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.467
- My bubba.

23:25.467 --> 23:27.066
I turn on my favorite show,

23:27.066 --> 23:29.033
and then I prop it up like this.

23:32.734 --> 23:38.100
So I am on a very low dose
of antianxiety medication.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.700
There's a lot of things
you can do.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.200
I've researched it.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.633
Ice on your wrists,

23:42.633 --> 23:45.633
flipping an elastic
against your wrist.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.367
- Right.
- Or you can suck a d---.

23:47.367 --> 23:48.600
- Excuse me.
- When the d--- is not around--

23:48.600 --> 23:50.433
Hold on!
- It always goes so nice,

23:50.433 --> 23:51.633
and then it goes ----ing
suck a d---.

23:51.633 --> 23:53.100
- Lisa, are you
writing this down?

23:53.100 --> 23:54.633
Put this sh--
in your phone, Lees.

23:54.633 --> 23:55.767
I can't suck my own d---,
so I need a baby bottle.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.500
Is that what you're
trying to say?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.367
- Or you can put ice cubes
in your mouth or a mint.

23:59.367 --> 24:01.600
- Can you just take that out
of the equation

24:01.600 --> 24:04.033
and go back to the baby bottle?

24:04.033 --> 24:08.500
- I find it comforting
to have a bubba.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.033
- That calms you down.

24:10.033 --> 24:13.633
- It makes you not think
about your anxiety.

24:13.633 --> 24:15.033
- Got it.

24:15.033 --> 24:17.767
A rumor emerged

24:17.767 --> 24:21.133
that James and Kristen
hooked up together.

24:21.133 --> 24:22.600
- I think we pretty much
figured out

24:22.600 --> 24:25.367
that that's
a giant bullsh-- rumor

24:25.367 --> 24:27.133
if everyone--
you probably didn't watch it,

24:27.133 --> 24:28.767
'cause you don't, like,
watch the show,

24:28.767 --> 24:30.633
which isn't cute;
it's unprofessional.

24:30.633 --> 24:33.467
But for everyone
who did watch it knows that--

24:33.467 --> 24:35.367
- I'm sorry; it was hard
to relive a relationship,

24:35.367 --> 24:37.533
and I fast-forwarded
through some of it.

24:37.533 --> 24:42.133
- James actually said,
"We hung out a little bit,"

24:42.133 --> 24:44.133
which turned into
"We fooled around,"

24:44.133 --> 24:45.533
"We hooked up."

24:45.533 --> 24:47.533
- He full-on admitted it
at the golf course.

24:47.533 --> 24:49.000
- No, I didn't!

24:49.000 --> 24:50.400
After the club, we went back

24:50.400 --> 24:51.667
to the afterparty
at Jax's house.

24:51.667 --> 24:52.667
She didn't bring out
any pillows.

24:52.667 --> 24:54.400
I got out pillows,

24:54.400 --> 24:55.667
because I was uncomfortable
at the Jacuzzi.

24:55.667 --> 24:57.533
- I went to bed.
They were in the room.

24:57.533 --> 24:59.533
The pillows were there.
I didn't say they did anything.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.400
- He's saying
that you ----ed Kristen.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.000
- I did--I did say that.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.700
- You said
the pillows looked suspicious.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.700
- I just said
there's the evidence.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.433
- That ain't evidence, Jax!

25:11.433 --> 25:12.433
- It doesn't make sense.

25:12.433 --> 25:13.767
It was 150 degrees.

25:13.767 --> 25:15.166
There's
an air-conditioned couch,

25:15.166 --> 25:16.700
beautiful couch right here.

25:16.700 --> 25:19.300
But there's pillows wedged
in my hot tub.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.033
- No, no, you were playing
secret squirrel,

25:21.033 --> 25:23.033
and you said
he was banging Kristen on the--

25:23.033 --> 25:24.433
- I never said that!
- Yes, you did!

25:24.433 --> 25:26.367
- You did say that.

25:26.367 --> 25:28.033
You're like, "I've banged girls
outside of a hot tub,

25:28.033 --> 25:29.033
and you do the pillows
like that."

25:29.033 --> 25:30.700
- I never saw it.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.433
- You basically, like,
motioned it out on the floor.

25:32.433 --> 25:34.700
- If it's 7:30 or 8:30
in the morning,

25:34.700 --> 25:36.367
there's got to be
a point in time

25:36.367 --> 25:37.433
you're like,
"Are we getting food,

25:37.433 --> 25:39.033
or are we, like, "

25:39.033 --> 25:41.333
Like, what--I'm sorry.
Like, it looks that way.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.567
- I'm starting to wonder that
about tonight.

25:43.567 --> 25:45.467
Are we gonna get food,
or are we gonna just...

25:46.700 --> 25:48.533
- I didn't see it.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.200
I woke up the next morning,
and there's evidence.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.633
- That's not the only evidence.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.066
- Yeah.

25:58.066 --> 25:59.600
- I mean, a little bit,
but not really.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.333
- When I said, "Did you--
did you hook up

26:01.333 --> 26:03.033
with Kristen" or whatever,

26:03.033 --> 26:04.700
like, he goes, "What,
did I hook up with Kristen?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.467
Maybe a little bit."
He said it so fast.

26:06.467 --> 26:09.066
.
That word was flipped.

26:09.066 --> 26:11.033
- Can I talk about what I said
for a second?

26:11.033 --> 26:14.066
I was like, "Wait a minute.
Did you hook up"--

26:14.066 --> 26:15.600
- Oh, no, we read it,
and we--

26:15.600 --> 26:16.734
- I got it, Kristen.
I got that.

26:16.734 --> 26:18.567
- Sandoval,
you're literally talking

26:18.567 --> 26:20.066
out of your asshole
right now.

26:20.066 --> 26:21.633
- No one will ever know
the truth to that.

26:21.633 --> 26:23.033
- He said, "Hang,"

26:23.033 --> 26:24.367
and the words
were on the damn screen,

26:24.367 --> 26:25.767
and I rewound it--

26:25.767 --> 26:27.367
- Why do you think they put
the words on the screen

26:27.367 --> 26:28.700
in the first place?

26:28.700 --> 26:30.633
- I saw it without the words
on the screen,

26:30.633 --> 26:31.767
and I heard it clearly.

26:31.767 --> 26:33.033
I did.
- Thank you.

26:33.033 --> 26:34.433
- James was more messed up

26:34.433 --> 26:36.066
than every single person
playing golf.

26:36.066 --> 26:38.367
Couldn't comprehend
his own name at that point.

26:38.367 --> 26:40.166
- And of course
Schwartz has no idea,

26:40.166 --> 26:43.633
because he was blacked out
and wound up at another resort.

26:43.633 --> 26:45.367
- Well, I mean, who doesn't
black out in Mexico?

26:45.367 --> 26:47.367
- I was just in Mexico,
and I didn't black out.

26:47.367 --> 26:48.633
- I didn't black out.

26:48.633 --> 26:50.500
- Uh...

26:50.500 --> 26:53.066
So, Kristen, nothing happened
by the Jacuzzi with the pillows.

26:53.066 --> 26:54.633
- No.

26:54.633 --> 26:57.600
- Jax, do you owe Kristen
and James an apology?

26:59.367 --> 27:02.100
- Because you nearly ruined
two relationships.

27:02.100 --> 27:03.400
- James had to call
his girlfriend and say,

27:03.400 --> 27:04.633
"Guess what.
There's a rumor."

27:04.633 --> 27:05.667
I had to go home
and tell my boyfriend,

27:05.667 --> 27:07.133
"Guess what.
There's a rumor."

27:07.133 --> 27:09.500
- Yes, and I was being blamed
for that.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.734
- And screamed at him

27:10.734 --> 27:12.500
because of your ass,
because of your ass,

27:12.500 --> 27:14.100
and because of your ass.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.133
- Nobody would take--
nobody would do that!

27:16.133 --> 27:18.533
- Spread a bullsh-- ass rumor
once again!

27:20.066 --> 27:21.767
I'll apologize if you think
I should apologize.

27:21.767 --> 27:25.667
- If it--if he didn't say it,
you should apologize.

27:25.667 --> 27:27.066
- Suck my d---.

27:27.066 --> 27:29.333
- Guys!
For the love of God.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.467
- I apologize for
misinterpreting what you said.

27:31.467 --> 27:34.100
- Thank you very much, Jax.
Appreciate it.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.533
- I apologize too.
I'm really sorry, guys.

27:36.533 --> 27:38.367
I thought that that's
what was said.

27:38.367 --> 27:41.000
I thought even I had said that.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.400
- Kristen, James texted you
that he never said this

27:44.400 --> 27:46.166
and that he was upset.

27:46.166 --> 27:49.433
You didn't believe him
and threw a drink at him.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.033
- No. Yup.

27:51.033 --> 27:52.533
- Are you ----ing kidding me,
Kristen?

27:52.533 --> 27:54.133
What the  are you doing?

27:55.700 --> 27:59.433
- Because my brain exploded
when I watched that episode.

27:59.433 --> 28:01.033
So I'm gonna apologize
to James

28:01.033 --> 28:02.667
for throwing a drink on you.

28:02.667 --> 28:05.033
It was literally
the three of us

28:05.033 --> 28:06.433
that left together.

28:06.433 --> 28:08.400
And for you to go
to my boyfriend then--

28:08.400 --> 28:10.100
- I didn't go to him.
He came to me.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.033
- You said, "Well,
look what she did to me."

28:12.033 --> 28:14.000
- I didn't want to tell him,
because I ----ing love Carter.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.700
I love you guys together.

28:15.700 --> 28:18.033
- But how is that any different
than me going to Ariana

28:18.033 --> 28:20.367
three, four years ago
and saying,

28:20.367 --> 28:22.433
"He did it to me;
he'll do it to you"?

28:22.433 --> 28:24.400
- It's completely different,
'cause I'm not vindictive.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.700
I wasn't going after you.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.533
- You're not ass-hurt anymore,

28:27.533 --> 28:29.066
so how is that
any

28:29.066 --> 28:30.600
- It's completely different,

28:30.600 --> 28:32.567
because I was not trying
to ruin your relationship.

28:32.567 --> 28:33.734
I felt absolutely horrible.

28:33.734 --> 28:35.033
- Carter did come to Tom
and ask--

28:35.033 --> 28:36.066
- He came to me.

28:39.567 --> 28:41.700
I want to talk about
Jax's meltdown at Sur.

28:41.700 --> 28:44.734
You really seemed to lose it
when you learned

28:44.734 --> 28:48.467
that Scheana was trying
to hook Brittany and Adam up

28:48.467 --> 28:49.600
in your home.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.333
Why did it make it worse
for you

28:51.333 --> 28:52.600
that it was in your home?

28:52.600 --> 28:54.467
- You mean why was it worse

28:54.467 --> 28:57.033
that the guy that she's trying
to hook up my girlfriend with

28:57.033 --> 28:58.734
that I live with
to come to my home?

28:58.734 --> 29:00.333
- Oh, yeah.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.133
Yeah, I didn't even
come home with shoes on.

29:02.133 --> 29:06.333
The most important whole thing
of this whole entire thing is,

29:06.333 --> 29:08.367
I decided
to flick everybody off,

29:08.367 --> 29:09.700
and then guess who's walking in

29:09.700 --> 29:11.567
as I'm flicking off
Lisa and Ken.

29:11.567 --> 29:13.033
you all.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.567
you all,

29:14.567 --> 29:16.500
you ----ing lying sacks
of ----ing goddamn sh--.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.100
♪ ♪

29:18.100 --> 29:20.600
- Oh, my God.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.367
- Your eyes were bulging.

29:22.367 --> 29:24.767
You were out of your tiny bonds.

29:24.767 --> 29:26.600
You were absolutely
out of order,

29:26.600 --> 29:28.367
and there was no containing you,

29:28.367 --> 29:30.567
so I had to get you
the hell out of there.

29:30.567 --> 29:32.600
- What did you think when he was
storming down the street?

29:32.600 --> 29:34.066
You were the last one
to see him.

29:34.066 --> 29:35.500
- I knew what had sparked it.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.100
We kind of, like,
started talking to him

29:37.100 --> 29:38.633
about him and Brittany
and something,

29:38.633 --> 29:40.333
and it literally just
knocked something loose

29:40.333 --> 29:41.600
where he's just like--

29:41.600 --> 29:43.500
- I exploded.
Everybody was like--

29:43.500 --> 29:44.700
It was like,
"Doo, doo, doo, doo doo,"

29:44.700 --> 29:46.500
and I was just like, "Ahhhh!"

29:46.500 --> 29:49.333
- I mean, I actually
went back out after him.

29:49.333 --> 29:50.633
- There was people
across the street

29:50.633 --> 29:52.133
at other restaurants, like--

29:52.133 --> 29:54.367
- And I had to get him
into an Uber, like,

29:54.367 --> 29:55.600
and get him
the  out of there.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.133
- He was unstoppable.

29:57.133 --> 29:58.533
It was like a bull seeing red
that night.

29:58.533 --> 30:00.000
Like, there was
no talking him down.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.333
It was bad.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.533
- I knew exactly
what I did the next day.

30:02.533 --> 30:03.734
- Belligerent.
- Yes.

30:03.734 --> 30:05.367
Of course, obviously,
I was embarrassed,

30:05.367 --> 30:06.734
because I embarrassed
the sh-- out of you.

30:06.734 --> 30:09.400
I went on a super apology tour
the next day,

30:09.400 --> 30:10.533
'cause I was just like--

30:10.533 --> 30:12.133
I think I texted
every camera crew.

30:12.133 --> 30:14.734
- Excuse me.
What about to me?

30:14.734 --> 30:17.533
- The last thing I want to do
is upset you and Ken,

30:17.533 --> 30:19.367
by any means.

30:19.367 --> 30:21.533
I mean, you guys have been
nothing but amazing to me.

30:21.533 --> 30:23.133
- I've given you a job
for years.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.033
That's a hell of a thing to do.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.500
- Do you think there'll be

30:32.500 --> 30:34.567
some little Katies
and little Schwartzys?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.767
- Oh, my gosh.
Who wants that?

30:36.767 --> 30:38.734
- Me!
- Oh, God, okay.

30:49.100 --> 30:49.300
- Welcome back

30:51.400 --> 30:53.100
to the "Vanderpump Rules"
season six reunion.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.433
Jax, Brittany, I want to talk
about your breakup,

30:55.433 --> 30:58.433
because after cheating
on Brittany

30:58.433 --> 31:00.533
and then a full summer
of trying to make it work,

31:00.533 --> 31:02.700
you decided to end
the relationship.

31:02.700 --> 31:04.400
- It wasn't just
a spur-of-the-moment thing,

31:04.400 --> 31:05.567
like I usually do.

31:05.567 --> 31:07.033
I thought about this
for a while,

31:07.033 --> 31:08.166
and I was going
back and forth, and I was--

31:08.166 --> 31:09.667
- But I don't think you did,

31:09.667 --> 31:11.100
because that whole morning,
we were fine.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.400
We were talking
about everything.

31:12.400 --> 31:13.734
- I thought about it
for two days.

31:13.734 --> 31:15.533
- You bragged about
having sex with me.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.033
- What did the women think
when they watched?

31:17.033 --> 31:18.600
- Gross.
- Yeah.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.433
I mean, obv--yeah, that was
actually really hard to watch.

31:20.433 --> 31:21.734
- She was completely blindsided.

31:21.734 --> 31:23.066
Like, she was caught
so off guard.

31:23.066 --> 31:24.600
It was like,
"So what do you mean?"

31:24.600 --> 31:27.433
- Just after everything
they'd been through--

31:27.433 --> 31:29.333
- Yeah, and her
sticking by his side

31:29.333 --> 31:32.033
and trying to forgive him
and work at it

31:32.033 --> 31:33.600
and just for him to be like,
" all that.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.400
Peace. I'm out."

31:35.400 --> 31:38.700
- The whole sex thing made it,
like, really, really bad.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.600
- You had sex with her,
and then you broke up with her.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.066
- Well, she initiated it.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.166
- That was the last
douche bag move

31:43.166 --> 31:44.567
that you pull in her life.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.600
- Sex is sometimes
not about relationships.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.467
Sometimes you just need
to get off.

31:48.467 --> 31:51.433
I can look in all your eyes
and say I honestly thought

31:51.433 --> 31:52.734
I was doing the right thing.

31:52.734 --> 31:54.433
- Then why did you
hook up with her?

31:54.433 --> 31:56.100
- I mean, why does anybody
hook up with anybody

31:56.100 --> 31:57.633
when

31:57.633 --> 31:59.367
- You know you're gonna
break up with her,

31:59.367 --> 32:00.767
and you have sex with her
right beforehand?

32:00.767 --> 32:03.633
That's kind of a mind ,
don't you think?

32:03.633 --> 32:05.467
- It was bad. It was horrible.
- Yeah, you're right.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.467
- That's why it literally came
out of nowhere for me.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.367
- At the time, I'm like,

32:09.367 --> 32:11.100
"I've done so much
to this poor girl."

32:11.100 --> 32:12.467
- After I had just given you
a trip to Mexico

32:12.467 --> 32:14.433
and a birthday party at Hooters

32:14.433 --> 32:16.100
and a birthday party
at some trampoline thing.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.567
- I know, but I just felt like
that was a surface thing.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.767
I think deep down inside,
you were ----ing devastated.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.500
- Of course, and I still am.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.100
- I felt like I just hurt her,

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
and I felt like she was
just gonna resent me,

32:26.100 --> 32:27.500
and I felt like this was

32:27.500 --> 32:29.100
the most mature, adult thing
to do.

32:29.100 --> 32:31.734
- But you can't beg somebody
to stay with you

32:31.734 --> 32:33.767
after all the hurt
that you put them through

32:33.767 --> 32:35.600
and then just throw them away
like they didn't even matter.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.133
- I also saw what I did to you
and how much I hurt you.

32:37.133 --> 32:39.200
But I thought
I can't be good for you.

32:39.200 --> 32:40.400
Like, I'm a mess.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.000
- Sweetie, this is why,

32:42.000 --> 32:44.100
when your relationship's
this unpredictable,

32:44.100 --> 32:45.667
you should take contraception.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.000
Yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.667
- You know,
let me buy you a condom.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.133
- I want to know, Brittany,

32:50.133 --> 32:52.533
how hard has this been for you?

32:52.533 --> 32:55.100
You've had to relive
this whole summer,

32:55.100 --> 32:58.200
where you had the women
telling you you deserve better.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.100
You've got Jennifer Lawrence
on "Watch What Happens Live"

33:01.100 --> 33:03.734
looking into the camera
and directly saying,

33:03.734 --> 33:06.500
"Break up with him.
You deserve better."

33:06.500 --> 33:08.667
What was the first thing
that went through your mind

33:08.667 --> 33:09.667
when he broke up with you?

33:09.667 --> 33:11.333
- I told him to get out.

33:11.333 --> 33:12.633
He didn't get out,

33:12.633 --> 33:14.400
so then I was like,
"All right, bye."

33:14.400 --> 33:15.533
Then I was like,
"You know what?

33:15.533 --> 33:16.734
I need to be by myself."

33:16.734 --> 33:18.000
I said, "Uber driver,
just take me

33:18.000 --> 33:19.367
to whatever hotel you want."

33:19.367 --> 33:20.700
And then
she dropped me off there,

33:20.700 --> 33:22.166
and I didn't talk
to anybody for hours.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.433
- And I'm texting,
texting, texting.

33:23.433 --> 33:25.400
But after that happened,
I was like,

33:25.400 --> 33:27.667
"I mean, this is not right."

33:27.667 --> 33:29.100
As soon as I did that,
I go, "This is a mistake."

33:29.100 --> 33:30.533
- "I love you so much,"

33:30.533 --> 33:32.166
but that also made me
even more mad,

33:32.166 --> 33:33.767
because I had put up
with so much,

33:33.767 --> 33:36.567
and then for you
to embarrass me like that,

33:36.567 --> 33:38.500
knowing the world
is gonna watch,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.500
like, I already had to deal
with being cheated on

33:40.500 --> 33:42.166
in front of the whole world

33:42.166 --> 33:45.000
and have all these women talk
about how stupid I am

33:45.000 --> 33:46.400
and everything else,

33:46.400 --> 33:48.467
and then I get dumped
in the end.

33:50.433 --> 33:53.166
Like, it was hard.
It was really, really ----ed up.

33:53.166 --> 33:54.166
- I'm sorry.
I truly am sorry.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.000
- It was awful.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.700
Like, I almost was more mad
about that, honestly.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.433
And that's why
I wouldn't talk to him.

33:59.433 --> 34:01.734
For over a month,
I wouldn't even talk to him.

34:01.734 --> 34:03.533
- Yeah, you were such a badass.
- Yeah.

34:03.533 --> 34:05.166
- Jax, you were adamant

34:05.166 --> 34:07.333
that you wouldn't leave
the apartment building.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.033
You broke up with her.

34:09.033 --> 34:10.734
How do you not leave
the apartment?

34:10.734 --> 34:13.467
What does that say?

34:15.133 --> 34:16.767
- It's so nasty.

34:18.066 --> 34:19.600
- It's so bad.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.734
When me and Kristen broke up,
I left my apartment.

34:21.734 --> 34:23.333
- Right.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.433
Sandoval, what were you saying
to him

34:24.433 --> 34:25.667
about the apartment issue?

34:25.667 --> 34:26.734
- I was like, "Dude,
what the

34:26.734 --> 34:28.533
are you doing, man?"

34:28.533 --> 34:31.600
- Brittany, you said
you DM'd Adam that night.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.700
- I did.

34:32.700 --> 34:34.600
"

34:36.066 --> 34:37.533
- So you and Adam
never did hook up.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.734
- No, no, no, no.

34:38.734 --> 34:40.533
- Did you try to go
on any dates?

34:40.533 --> 34:42.734
- Uh...

34:42.734 --> 34:44.734
- You shagged a couple
of guys in Pump.

34:44.734 --> 34:47.633
- I didn't shag anybody
at Pump.

34:47.633 --> 34:49.500
- Okay, next season.

34:49.500 --> 34:53.166
- What happened
between the finale and now?

34:53.166 --> 34:56.467
- I was trying to be single,
be away from him.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.767
- I stayed in a hotel
for a week.

34:58.767 --> 35:00.200
Then I didn't come home

35:00.200 --> 35:02.433
until he went to Florida
for a week.

35:02.433 --> 35:03.467
And then when he was
coming back,

35:03.467 --> 35:04.633
I went to Kentucky.

35:04.633 --> 35:06.633
And then I came back
from Kentucky,

35:06.633 --> 35:09.367
and me and Scheana went to,
like, Atlanta, San Francisco.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.633
Like, I was just trying
to get away and get out.

35:11.633 --> 35:14.433
Just the calls and the calls--
he didn't give up.

35:14.433 --> 35:15.633
So it was just kind of like

35:15.633 --> 35:17.500
my feelings
just don't go away.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.633
And then just over time,
we ended up...

35:20.633 --> 35:22.100
getting back together.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.667
I just realized
that he's the person

35:24.667 --> 35:26.533
that I want to be with.

35:26.533 --> 35:29.133
- How hard has this been
for you

35:29.133 --> 35:31.500
to have the pressure
of all the fans

35:31.500 --> 35:32.767
wanting more for you?

35:32.767 --> 35:34.767
- That's, like,
the hardest part for me,

35:34.767 --> 35:38.133
because I've done nothing
but try to be a good person

35:38.133 --> 35:41.000
and try to live
a positive life.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.400
I would never go and say, like,
mean things to somebody

35:44.400 --> 35:45.667
who I didn't know.

35:45.667 --> 35:48.100
And I felt very strong
in myself,

35:48.100 --> 35:49.533
because I still, in the end,

35:49.533 --> 35:51.467
was doing what I believed
was right,

35:51.467 --> 35:54.133
and I still was trying
to put my heart first

35:54.133 --> 35:56.133
and trying to do
what I wanted to do

35:56.133 --> 35:58.133
for the person that I loved.

35:58.133 --> 36:00.600
I don't think it's okay to be
treated the way I was treated.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.000
I don't think it was okay
for any of that.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.567
- I wonder, from the women,
what were your reactions

36:06.567 --> 36:08.000
when she took him back?

36:08.000 --> 36:12.133
- All of us think
that she deserves a prince.

36:12.133 --> 36:14.533
Above anyone else,
she really deserves someone

36:14.533 --> 36:15.767
that treats her--

36:15.767 --> 36:17.033
- Because she's so kind.

36:17.033 --> 36:19.000
- Yes,
in such an amazing way.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.433
So of course there's gonna be
a little, "What are you doing?"

36:22.433 --> 36:24.400
- Let me ask you this.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.700
It seems that the thing

36:25.700 --> 36:28.433
that brought you guys
all back together

36:28.433 --> 36:31.700
was the untimely
and unfortunate passing

36:31.700 --> 36:33.700
of Jax's dad.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.567
He's said today

36:35.567 --> 36:38.433
that he's really changed
since his dad died.

36:38.433 --> 36:40.400
- He had to be very vulnerable
and very honest

36:40.400 --> 36:42.500
and stop putting on this front

36:42.500 --> 36:44.433
of whatever emotion
he was feeling.

36:44.433 --> 36:45.700
But I really think

36:45.700 --> 36:47.600
it's just Jax
just stopped bullsh---ing.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.333
- Jax has more softness
to him.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.166
- I seriously, like,
look at myself.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.734
I'm like, "I'm tired of myself."

36:52.734 --> 36:54.467
- You've said that before.

36:54.467 --> 36:56.734
Brittany,
does he treat you better?

36:56.734 --> 36:58.400
- Oh, yes.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.734
- I don't think
there's any possible way

36:59.734 --> 37:01.467
I could ever do anything
possibly wrong to you again.

37:01.467 --> 37:03.333
I think of her first,
which I never did.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.467
- Everything about him
is different and better.

37:05.467 --> 37:08.066
He's getting along with Kristen.

37:08.066 --> 37:09.734
- He's able to, like,
have fun with my friends.

37:09.734 --> 37:14.066
He has just been treating me,
like, so much better.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.467
Like, it's just so different.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.066
- I love you so much.

37:18.066 --> 37:21.567
- He...

37:21.567 --> 37:23.066
he's just more calm,

37:23.066 --> 37:25.600
and he's just
not talking down on me.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.400
He is putting me first
on everything.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.066
- Stassi wants him back
now she's heard all this.

37:31.066 --> 37:32.600
- God, I know.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.066
- I think people will be
watching tonight

37:35.066 --> 37:37.500
and will be really happy for you

37:37.500 --> 37:41.600
that you have found peace
and that you've found happiness

37:41.600 --> 37:44.367
and hope that this one,
you know--

37:44.367 --> 37:45.734
- Sticks to it.
- Sticks to it.

37:45.734 --> 37:48.066
We'll be right back.

37:51.166 --> 37:53.367
Could you imagine him
working at Sur again?

37:53.367 --> 37:56.033
- I don't think
I'm that desperate right now.

37:56.033 --> 37:58.200
- Come on; I wasn't that much
of a bad person at work.

38:08.633 --> 38:09.066
- We are back

38:09.066 --> 38:09.367
- We are back
here in Los Angeles.

38:11.533 --> 38:14.133
We've reached the end of the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion.

38:14.133 --> 38:17.533
Lisa, after Jax's meltdown
at Sur,

38:17.533 --> 38:19.133
you were really upset with him,
and you said

38:19.133 --> 38:21.533
you wouldn't give him
the satisfaction

38:21.533 --> 38:23.400
of firing him.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.600
You wanted him to resign.
Why?

38:25.600 --> 38:29.000
- Well, because often Jax
kind of takes the victim role,

38:29.000 --> 38:30.533
you know, and if I said,
"You're fired,"

38:30.533 --> 38:32.400
he'd be like, "Oh, well,
you know, I deserve it,

38:32.400 --> 38:34.133
and I'm an asshole"
and this, that, and the other.

38:34.133 --> 38:36.767
And I wanted him to actually do
the only decent thing

38:36.767 --> 38:39.100
that he should have done
in that situation.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.767
- Jax, you're not working
in Tampa.

38:41.767 --> 38:44.633
Lisa, could you imagine him
working at Sur again?

38:44.633 --> 38:47.133
- Well, if she needs someone

38:47.133 --> 38:48.533
to pick up a couple shifts
here and there,

38:48.533 --> 38:50.133
I wouldn't mind,
if she needs somebody.

38:50.133 --> 38:52.700
- I don't think
I'm that desperate right now.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.500
- Lisa, I--come on.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.433
I wasn't that much
of a bad person at work.

38:56.433 --> 38:58.433
- Tom Tom might give him a job.

38:58.433 --> 39:00.166
- I think I need to go get
a job at Tom Tom.

39:00.166 --> 39:01.700
- Schwartz, congratulations
again on the bar.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.133
When can we expect
your first blackout

39:04.133 --> 39:05.133
and panic attack?

39:06.667 --> 39:08.533
- Listen, I've come
a long way since then.

39:08.533 --> 39:10.133
I think you're gonna be
quite impressed.

39:10.133 --> 39:11.567
Right now, I'm like
a little caterpillar.

39:11.567 --> 39:13.433
There's gonna be
a metamorphosis,

39:13.433 --> 39:15.367
and I'm gonna emerge as
a beautiful business butterfly.

39:15.367 --> 39:17.166
- You're gonna spread your legs
and fly.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.100
- Katie, you've come so far
this season.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.567
Do you think there'll be

39:20.567 --> 39:22.400
some little Katies
and little Schwartzys

39:22.400 --> 39:24.033
padding around soon?

39:24.033 --> 39:25.100
- Oh, gosh,
who wants that?

39:25.100 --> 39:26.166
- Me!
- Oh, God, okay.

39:26.166 --> 39:27.433
- Yeah, then I'll have them.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.700
We can all have our kids
together.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.567
- We talk about that,
but I think right now,

39:32.567 --> 39:35.200
we're not getting any younger,
so soonish.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.433
- Stassi, I'm very excited
about your new boyfriend.

39:38.433 --> 39:41.333
We all can't wait to find out
what he thinks of Lisa's ass.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.066
- Oh, God.

39:43.066 --> 39:45.700
- Do you think we'll be
seeing him next season, maybe?

39:45.700 --> 39:47.600
- Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.166
I--yeah, unless--
yes, un--yes.

39:51.166 --> 39:53.400
- Brittany, how much trouble
is Jax gonna be in

39:53.400 --> 39:55.166
when he gets home tonight?

39:55.166 --> 39:57.734
Anything that he said that he
needs to apologize for now?

39:57.734 --> 39:58.734
- I think he did
a pretty good job

39:58.734 --> 40:00.567
with all the stuff.

40:00.567 --> 40:02.600
I'm glad that he apologized
to everybody.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.166
- Jax, for real,

40:04.166 --> 40:06.200
what do you predict
for you and Brittany?

40:06.200 --> 40:07.700
- We'll definitely be together
for the rest of our lives.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.033
I don't think it could get
any worse now.

40:09.033 --> 40:10.533
I think it's just gonna
get better.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.033
- Well, I hope not.

40:13.033 --> 40:14.600
- Kristen,
you think there's marriage

40:14.600 --> 40:17.367
in your future with Carter?

40:17.367 --> 40:18.633
- I'm good with having

40:18.633 --> 40:21.233
two dogs and a boyfriend
at home for now.

40:21.233 --> 40:23.033
- Speaking of boyfriends,

40:23.033 --> 40:24.633
Scheana, you having fun
being single?

40:24.633 --> 40:26.066
- I am.

40:26.066 --> 40:27.367
- Do you predict
the next time we see you

40:27.367 --> 40:28.700
that you'll still be single?

40:28.700 --> 40:31.033
- Yes, I'm staying single
this year.

40:31.033 --> 40:32.233
- Okay.

40:32.233 --> 40:34.500
Lala, this was a big year
for you.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.500
You know, you stepped out
publicly with your man.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.633
You brought him

at all

40:52.633 --> 40:54.200

41:12.133 --> 41:13.467
is it about the pasta?

41:13.467 --> 41:16.000

is next

41:27.400 --> 41:28.533
to get married in this group?

41:28.533 --> 41:31.133
- I think it's gonna be you.

41:32.667 --> 41:34.533
Hell yes.

41:34.533 --> 41:37.100
- But, you know, I really just
want to say to all of you,

41:37.100 --> 41:39.767
I mean, I love
each and every one of them.

41:39.767 --> 41:41.700
But it's like--
being on a reality show

41:41.700 --> 41:43.667
is like looking in a big mirror.

41:43.667 --> 41:44.667
- Yeah.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.166
- And some of you

41:46.166 --> 41:47.767
might not have liked
the reflection,

41:47.767 --> 41:51.166
and I hope that you can grow
from it.

41:51.166 --> 41:54.133
- Usually, we end
with bringing out Ken and Peter

41:54.133 --> 41:56.033
with celebratory shots.

41:56.033 --> 41:58.567
This year, it's not about
the shots.

41:58.567 --> 41:59.700
Come on out, guys.

42:01.700 --> 42:04.433

doesn't he?

Thank you.

of pasta.

This is awesome.

I don't even care about
anybody else right now.
