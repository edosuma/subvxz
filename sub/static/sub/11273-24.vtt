00:02.480 --> 00:05.358
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.072
Oh, boy, that's the third time
you beat me, Mike.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.913
- I guess I owe you another beer.
- No, that's okay. I gotta run.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.719
I'll take a rain check
on that one, huh?

00:21.360 --> 00:22.873
Lost again, huh?

00:23.120 --> 00:24.872
Yeah, I don't know what's the matter
with me.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.031
It seems like that guy just has
my number, you know?

00:27.240 --> 00:29.276
Forget about it.
Next time he comes in here,

00:29.440 --> 00:32.351
you just challenge him
to some ltalian arm wrestling.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.750
- Oh, I never tried that.
- Come here.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.911
Give me your arm.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.873
Okay, now, I'm gonna pull
as hard as I can,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.871
and you resist me
with all your strength.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.315
- All right.
- Go.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.791
I beat Carla!

00:51.000 --> 00:52.797
And I'm not even ltalian.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.719
You wine them.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.518
You dine them.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.431
Tell them how pretty they are.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.431
Buy them fancy presents.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.792
Finally, you get up the nerve to ask
one of the little dears to marry you.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.235
What do you get
for all your trouble? Squat.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.750
I thought you'd pretty much gotten
over that Diane problem of yours.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.478
Oh, it's not as serious as it sounds.

02:21.640 --> 02:25.519
See, this is the one-year anniversary of
the day Diane deserted me at the altar.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.513
To repress my bitterness would be
detrimental to my recovery.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.433
So on this day, and on this day alone,

02:31.600 --> 02:34.398
I'm going to spew out my venom

02:34.560 --> 02:37.916
and exorcise the blond demon
that haunts my soul.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.472
Well, happy anniversary.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.239
Holy moly guacamole.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.960
Terre Haute, lndiana.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.477
Oh, I wouldn't throw her out of my bed
for eating crackers.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.069
Why else would she be there?

02:58.680 --> 03:02.468
Yeah, that's very humorous, Normie.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.029
Yeah, in light of the fact that
a leading woman's magazine

03:05.200 --> 03:08.510
just recently completed a survey
which showed that postmen

03:08.680 --> 03:10.477
are the most desired lovers
right after--

03:10.640 --> 03:13.154
Rock stars and heart surgeons.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.191
Well, you know what they
say down at the P.O...

03:15.360 --> 03:17.954
"Postmen deliver daily."

03:19.760 --> 03:22.718
Have we had this
conversation before, Norm?

03:22.880 --> 03:26.190
Cliffie, we've had every
conversation before.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.994
Boy, when people start finishing
each other's sentences, they're--

03:29.160 --> 03:31.230
Spending far too much time together.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.756
Say, Woody, let me have
another beer there.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.512
Hey, did you hear
the one about the--?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.358
Shepherd and the parrot? Yeah.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.716
That was a good one.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.150
- I had a very nice time, Brian.
- Me too.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.716
Well, well, if it isn't
Kitten With a Whip.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.271
That's funny.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.869
Sam, I'd like you to meet Brian.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.234
Brian, this is Sam.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.719
And...?

04:02.880 --> 04:05.997
Oh, this is, yeah, April.
April, that's Brian.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.718
Hi.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.754
- And I'm obviously, I guess, Diane.
- Oh, right, yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.912
- So you two have a good time?
- Oh, very nice. Very nice time.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.749
- Yeah, we had a great time.
- Yeah, we had a fabulous time.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.750
It was just a movie
and a burger afterwards.

04:21.959 --> 04:26.238
Oh, but what a film. And the ground
beef was excellent, very lean.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.239
Listen, I wanna thank you
for giving me a ride home.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.078
That's a great car you've got there.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.550
Yes, Brian has a wonderful car too,
and it gets excellent mileage.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.676
What kind of mileage you get?

04:37.840 --> 04:40.832
Thirty-five on the highway,
26 around town.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.919
Thirty-two and 24. Sorry.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.269
Well, thanks again.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.556
Good night.

05:13.280 --> 05:16.750
What a putrid display.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.197
You know, people come here
to relax and enjoy themselves.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.510
They don't wanna look at that.
Do you?

05:23.720 --> 05:25.153
Yeah!

05:26.640 --> 05:28.870
This is sick.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.874
Brian has a big-screen TV.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.918
- April has a satellite dish.
- You are so childish.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.713
Excuse me, are you the owner?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.273
Yeah, that's right, Sam Malone.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.512
Hi. Phil Schumacher, campaign
manager for Janet Eldridge.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.836
She's running for re-election
to city council.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.879
Listen, the councillor is just down the
street on a walking tour of the district.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.230
Would it be all right
if she came in to meet the folks,

05:51.400 --> 05:54.437
and perhaps answer some questions
for the newspaper reporters?

05:54.640 --> 05:56.596
- Sure. Why not?
- Great. Thanks a lot, Sam.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.797
Hey, how about that? We're a stop
on the old campaign trail.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.315
Oh, Sam. You're so politically naive.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.153
Janet Eldridge is an
old-money conservative

06:05.320 --> 06:08.198
who consistently supports
big-business interests

06:08.360 --> 06:12.638
over badly-needed social programs.
She's a real political opportunist.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.748
Well, if she's that bad,
I'll have her out of here in a flash.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
Councillor Janet Eldridge.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.036
She's got until Christmas,
then she's out of here.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.711
I could use your support
in the upcoming election.

06:26.880 --> 06:27.995
Yeah, right.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.350
You got fame, money,
power and looks.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.875
- What you need, I ain't got.
- I need your vote.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.914
I need a man. But you don't see me
going around bars begging for one.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.477
I give. I know when I'm overmatched.
I'm glad I'm not running against you.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.875
She's smooth. I'll give her that.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.430
Sam, I'd like you to meet Councillor
Eldridge. Councillor, this is--

06:47.600 --> 06:49.352
"Mayday" Malone needs
no introduction to me

06:49.520 --> 06:50.635
or anyone else in this town.

06:50.840 --> 06:53.991
I was a big fan when you pitched for
the Sox. I think you're just wonderful.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.633
Well, it's mutual.

06:55.840 --> 06:59.549
- Oh, you're a fan of the councillor's?
- No, I think I'm wonderful too.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.114
Hey, hey, hey, Sammy.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.714
Unless these tired old eyes
are deceiving me, pal,

07:07.880 --> 07:10.440
there's something going on
between you and the councillor.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.916
I don't think so. No, no, no.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.719
Watching that woman work this room
has brought me to a decision.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.350
You've decided to work it too
for a change?

07:20.520 --> 07:23.034
I'm going to campaign
for Janet Eldridge's opponent

07:23.200 --> 07:25.509
- in the coming election.
- Is that right?

07:25.720 --> 07:27.995
I've voted for him before,
but he really needs my help now.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.636
Would anyone like to join me
in this campaign?

07:30.800 --> 07:34.873
Working side by side untiringly
to carry James Fleener to victory?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.075
I would.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.189
James Fleener is the finest man
to enter public life in the last decade.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.032
I'd be honoured to work for him.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.234
All right. He needs all the help
he can get.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.109
Who the hell is James Fleener?

07:50.160 --> 07:53.038
- Boy, oh, boy, is Miss Eldridge pretty.
- Yeah.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.158
You know, back home in Hanover,
everybody on the town council

07:56.320 --> 07:58.880
has a paunch and smokes
big, smelly cigars.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.396
Don't you have any women
on the town council there?

08:01.600 --> 08:03.477
Yeah.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.554
Sammy, I've been noticing
she just can't take her eyes off you.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.075
- You gonna ask her out?
- What are you talking about?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.470
Well, look at her.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.989
She's a good woman, Sam.
She deserves it.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.639
I don't know.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.393
Yeah, politics makes
strange bedfellows, Sam.

08:23.560 --> 08:27.109
So do you and anyone or anything.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.477
I guess she's a little out of your league
when you come right down to it, huh?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.835
Yeah, what's the matter, Sam?
She too much for you?

08:35.039 --> 08:37.554
I just don't think it's a good idea
to hop into bed with someone

08:37.720 --> 08:39.153
who could raise my taxes.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.109
Councillor Eldridge will take
a few questions now.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.475
Jerry Baker, Boston Star.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.355
Councillor, do you support the effort of
the so-called Grant Avenue Coalition

08:49.520 --> 08:52.114
to overturn the city council's rezoning

08:52.280 --> 08:54.191
of that neighbourhood
for commercial use?

08:54.400 --> 08:56.630
I voted in favour of rezoning
and would do so again.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.031
My reasons are a matter of public
record. No, I do not support them.

09:01.920 --> 09:06.357
Clifford C. Clavin, U.S. Postal Service,
South Central Branch.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.273
In view of the carnage taking place
in our postal routes,

09:09.440 --> 09:11.795
are you in favour of beefing up
our leash laws to include

09:11.960 --> 09:14.872
Iife imprisonment for
the canine offenders?

09:16.480 --> 09:20.234
I think that's a bit drastic,
but I am in favour of doing all we can

09:20.440 --> 09:23.034
to support our overworked
and underpaid postal carriers.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.792
You do a wonderful job.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.669
That woman has got my support,
and I will deliver you the postal vote.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.957
Too bad it'll be to the wrong address.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.435
My name is Diane Chambers,
and I have a question.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.553
- Do you work here?
- How come no one ever knows that?

09:39.720 --> 09:42.393
Yes, I'm a waitress and proud of it.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.678
In a work-ethic kind of way.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.717
Councillor, you have been accused

09:47.880 --> 09:50.678
of being out of touch
with your constituency.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.831
Do you expect this stroll
through the neighbourhood

09:53.000 --> 09:54.638
to make up for four years of neglect?

09:54.840 --> 09:56.193
- Hold on just--
- It's all right.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.830
Miss Chambers, I represent every
one of the people in my district.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.911
If I don't get out and talk
as often as I'd like,

10:02.080 --> 10:04.071
it's because I'm in my office
or at council meetings

10:04.240 --> 10:07.710
or in conference with civic
and business leaders 1 6 hours a day.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.275
I've never missed a vote
in my four years on the council,

10:10.480 --> 10:12.755
and if I'm elected again
I intend to work even harder

10:12.920 --> 10:16.390
for the people
I am privileged to represent.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.113
Good, Diane,
you got her on the ropes.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.276
Tom Edwards, Boston Sentinel.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.789
Oh, excuse me, I think this gentleman
had his hand up first.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.355
Yeah, I'm not a reporter,
I'm just a voter.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.953
But I have a very important question.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.238
Do you like Chinese food, and if so,
have you ever eaten it in the bathtub?

10:38.560 --> 10:41.279
Yes, and no comment.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.392
Well, in that case I have
a follow-up question here.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.710
What are you doing for dinner
Thursday night?

10:48.560 --> 10:51.836
The offer is very tempting, Mr Malone,
but I will have to respectfully decline.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.514
- The campaign keeps me very busy.
- I understand.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.871
What I won't give up
for the people of this district.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.958
- Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you very much.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.272
Look at that, Norm.
She shot Sammy down.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.750
Impeachment proceedings
should begin immediately.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.712
She may be out of touch
with the common man,

11:10.880 --> 11:13.872
but she can sure spot
a common roach.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.758
- Sam?
- Yeah?

11:17.920 --> 11:20.514
This is Janet's private number.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.875
She wants you to call her.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.356
- Guys, Janet's private number here.
- All right!

11:30.520 --> 11:34.035
Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!

11:34.200 --> 11:36.919
Fleener! Fleener! Fleener!

11:37.120 --> 11:39.350
Okay. Fleener!

11:39.560 --> 11:41.755
- Sammy! Sammy!
- Fleener! Fleener!

11:50.800 --> 11:52.631
Say, Diane...

11:52.800 --> 11:56.554
...did you happen to hear
that Sam is going out

11:56.720 --> 11:59.280
with Councillor Eldridge
again tonight?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.510
I believe I heard something like that.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.871
Did you know it was for dinner
at the governor's mansion?

12:05.040 --> 12:07.508
I recall someone mentioning it.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.877
Did they also mention that
they were going in a limousine?

12:12.480 --> 12:14.471
- A limo?
- Not a limo.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.200
A limousine.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.836
So, what are you
doing tonight, Diane?

12:22.040 --> 12:25.476
Frasier and I are going canvassing
for Jim Fleener in the neighbourhood,

12:25.640 --> 12:28.950
and then we're stuffing mailers
into envelopes later on.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.476
Well, that sounds like fun too.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.795
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

12:36.960 --> 12:39.520
- Norman.
- What's happening, Mr Peterson?

12:39.720 --> 12:42.917
The question is, Woody,
why is it happening to me?

12:43.080 --> 12:45.548
Well, you're a little late there, Normie.
Where you been?

12:45.720 --> 12:48.280
Well, I was at Hurley's Market.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.989
I took Vera out for a little grocery
shopping, then a little dinner.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.469
Oh, gee, that's nice, Mr P.
Where did you go to dinner?

12:54.680 --> 12:56.272
Hurley's Market.

12:56.440 --> 13:00.194
They were giving out those little
sausage samples on toothpicks.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.072
By the way, guys,
for your information,

13:02.240 --> 13:05.198
a dozen appears to be
the cut-off number.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.229
Say, did you hear that I'm going to
the governor's place tonight for dinner?

13:18.400 --> 13:19.719
Yes.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.957
There was a rumour in the air.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.634
Back when there was air.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.392
You got a second here?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.551
Listen...

13:31.720 --> 13:34.632
...you know that ice cream stuff they
serve in the middle of dinner there?

13:34.840 --> 13:36.592
- Is it okay--?
- Sorbet.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.113
Sorbet, right, sorbet.

13:38.920 --> 13:43.277
Is it okay if I were to ask
for chocolate sauce with that?

13:44.320 --> 13:47.437
- I think it's wise not to.
- All right, all right.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.556
And for God's sake,
remember that a bowl of warm water

13:51.720 --> 13:53.631
- with a slice of lemon in it--
- I know, I know.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.116
It's a finger bowl,
it's not lemon soup.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.910
You know, nobody would've known
that time if you hadn't screamed.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.273
You certainly have been at
the councillor's beck and call lately.

14:10.440 --> 14:14.558
I never thought I'd see you
so controlled by a woman.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.798
What happened to the Sam Malone
who once said to me,

14:17.960 --> 14:21.350
"Hey, we're gonna do
what I wanna do from now on"?

14:21.560 --> 14:24.916
You left him in a restaurant
with a face full of fettuccini.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.554
That doesn't mean I didn't like him.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.794
"Wim with Jim?"

14:39.960 --> 14:42.155
I thought it up.
It's very Joycean.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.312
If that means stupid, I agree.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.794
Frasier, put the box
in the back, please.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.518
If you're looking for something to do,
you can start stuffing the envelopes.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.353
I've been stuffing all day, Diane.

14:56.560 --> 15:00.075
Frankly, the task has lost its
considerable power to charm me.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.155
Frasier, that's a defeatist attitude.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.311
We don't need quitters
on the Fleener team.

15:05.520 --> 15:09.115
- Hey, Sam, you're on TV.
- Oh, yeah, look at that.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.471
- Nice-looking threads, Sam.
- Yeah.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.831
Janet picked out the suit. She really
knows what looks good on the tube.

15:23.640 --> 15:24.755
Carla,

15:24.920 --> 15:28.117
even though we have our differences,
and we're frequently at odds,

15:28.280 --> 15:31.636
there's one thing we very much have
in common:

15:31.960 --> 15:34.474
We both like Sam.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.193
And I'm concerned about him.

15:36.360 --> 15:41.070
I think he might get hurt by this liaison
with Janet Eldridge.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.429
Yeah, you're right.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.398
He's having a lot of laughs
and a hot time with a beautiful woman.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.393
The man is a glutton for punishment.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.712
This is no romp, Carla.
It's more serious than that.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.997
And the worst part is that she's just
using him. I mean, it all adds up.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.435
He's an outstanding sports figure,

15:59.600 --> 16:02.194
he's attractive, and in this town
it doesn't hurt that he's lrish.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.396
- He's a vote getter.
- So what?

16:04.560 --> 16:07.757
So when the election's over,
it's "So long, Sam."

16:07.920 --> 16:10.753
And I think he's really going to be
hurt by this. That's "so what."

16:10.960 --> 16:14.430
You are full of beans. Women come
and women go in Sam's life.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.479
He's just having a few grins,
and I can prove it.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.395
Hey, a word over here, heartthrob.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.033
Coming at you.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.872
Cliffie, Cliffie. I got this one.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.470
You know, Sammy,
I've been thinking.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.393
You have got a great set-up
with this Eldridge babe.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.397
You're going to all these
high-toned parties,

16:40.560 --> 16:43.154
meeting a lot of fancy people,
driving around in big cars.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.710
And the best thing is,
you are getting to do to a politician

16:46.880 --> 16:49.599
what they've been doing
to us for years.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.998
You know, Carla, sometimes
you got a lousy sense of humour.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.633
Sorry.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.679
"A few grins," Carla?

17:06.079 --> 17:08.230
- Boy, you look fabulous.
- Thank you. So do you.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.752
Well, thank you.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.115
Listen, I am famished here.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.156
Do you know what kind of sorbet
they're serving?

17:14.599 --> 17:17.194
- No, I was curious about that myself.
- Well--

17:17.359 --> 17:19.351
Before we go I have to make
a couple of phone calls.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.318
- May I use your office?
- Yeah. Right under the whale there.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.512
Look at the size of that limo.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.511
Hey, Your Excellence?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.349
- Does it have a TV?
- Yes, it does.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.592
Go and take a look at it if you want.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.711
Oh, hot dog!

17:37.840 --> 17:42.595
- Oh, boy, the exuberance of youth.
- Yeah. Wide-eyed and innocent.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.868
Well, I guess those days
are long gone for you and me.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.951
Yeah, yeah.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.555
Thanks, Edith. Yeah, I'll talk to you
tomorrow. Bye-bye.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.075
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Councillor Eldridge.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.829
Please, call me Janet. What can I do
for you? It's Diane, isn't it?

18:05.320 --> 18:07.117
Yes.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.352
I'm speaking on behalf
of everyone here at Cheers,

18:10.520 --> 18:14.798
and I would just like to say
that we're all very fond of Sam.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.389
And, frankly, we're a little worried
about him.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.710
We wouldn't like to see him get hurt.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.239
What are you getting at?

18:21.680 --> 18:26.800
Janet, I've made no secret
of my opposition to you politically,

18:26.960 --> 18:31.158
but let's retract our claws
for the moment, shall we?

18:31.320 --> 18:34.437
Let's stop hissing at each other.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.877
Do you have a problem with cats?

18:39.200 --> 18:40.872
No.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.792
But it's the consensus of opinion
around here

18:42.960 --> 18:45.554
that you're using Sam
to get re-elected,

18:45.720 --> 18:47.358
with total disregard for his feelings,

18:47.520 --> 18:49.750
and we don't think that's
a very nice thing to do.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.551
I see.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.233
Well, I'll be honest with you, Diane.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.709
That's exactly why
I started seeing him.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.033
So l-- We were right.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.718
Well, I'm warning you,
I have some influence with Sam.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.552
Yes, I know.
He thinks a great deal of you.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.756
Anytime I wanted to--
He said that?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.797
Yes.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.715
He mentions you often.
And Sam is a man of few words.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.189
Well, he only knows a few.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.313
Yes.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.313
He is a simple man in many ways,
but I think that's his strength.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.914
I mean, I never met anyone
who didn't like him.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.469
Well, good.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.710
But I don't understand
why we're standing here

19:31.880 --> 19:36.874
chatting so enjoyably when you just
admitted that you're using Sam.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.918
That's not what I said, Diane.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.071
You didn't let me finish.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.272
Please.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.911
Well, when I first started
seeing Sam,

19:46.080 --> 19:49.390
perhaps I had ulterior motives
in mind,

19:49.560 --> 19:52.120
but my attitude toward him
has changed dramatically.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.231
I've learned that Sam has something
that's pretty special.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.118
I've never experienced
with any other man

19:59.280 --> 20:01.840
the feeling I have when I'm with him.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.468
When we're at a fundraiser
or something like that,

20:04.640 --> 20:08.315
I'll watch him across the room
talking with some people,

20:08.480 --> 20:12.189
and sometimes a feeling
comes over me so strong

20:12.360 --> 20:14.828
that it nearly makes me ache.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.277
Oh, God.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.033
I sound like a silly schoolgirl.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.199
That's the truth.
Does that make you feel better?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.472
It certainly does.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.952
I'm awfully glad
we put this matter to rest.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.918
You like Sam. And Sam likes you.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.755
No one's going to get hurt.
Well, "wack to berk."

20:49.960 --> 20:54.397
Boy, you're really good.
You almost had me fooled there.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.153
But I don't believe a word you said.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.358
When this campaign is over,

21:00.520 --> 21:04.149
Sam's going to last about as long
as your campaign promises.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.594
Well, back to work.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.078
And I would like to thank
each and every one of you.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.317
- This is a victory for all of us.
- Yes!

21:28.520 --> 21:30.795
Well, not quite all of us.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.876
I guess that's about--

21:35.040 --> 21:36.951
I guess that's about it. Thanks.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.991
Thanks, Diane, for all your help.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.674
Nobody ever worked harder
for me than you.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.589
In fact, I think you worked harder
than I did.

21:46.400 --> 21:50.109
You did your best.
That's all that matters.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.518
Say, listen, did you know
you're out of liquor?

21:58.280 --> 21:59.793
And now I would like
to bring up a man

22:00.000 --> 22:02.309
without whom I would not be
standing here tonight.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.469
- Sam?
- Yeah?

22:03.640 --> 22:06.438
- Would you let Phil through, please?
- Oh, yeah.

22:08.320 --> 22:11.915
My campaign manager,
Mr Phil Schumacher!

22:17.520 --> 22:18.953
And this guy

22:19.120 --> 22:21.680
has been such a tremendous
help to me in this campaign.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.115
I'm sure he needs no introduction.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.078
But for those ladies in the audience
who would like an introduction,

22:27.240 --> 22:29.356
you're not gonna get one.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.031
That was my last chance.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.555
Looks like I blew it.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.116
Me too.
