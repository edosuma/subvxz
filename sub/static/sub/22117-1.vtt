[David] <i>My name is David Goran.</i>

this is just as bad as it looks.</i>

00:50.851 --> 00:53.852
<i>You may ask
how a former champion and fight legend</i>

00:53.854 --> 00:56.573

somewhere in Mexico.</i>

00:58.067 --> 00:59.743

[grunts]

01:05.241 --> 01:06.792
<i>it all began with a fight.</i>

02:30.659 --> 02:32.211
Mr. Goran, good evening.

02:32.244 --> 02:34.786
On behalf of my staff and I,
I just wanna say that we caught the fight.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.173
Congratulations.

02:36.415 --> 02:37.716
Thank you.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.259
Any mail?

02:39.543 --> 02:40.928
Um, let me check.

02:44.548 --> 02:45.849
Not today.

02:46.008 --> 02:47.559
But it must feel good to win.

02:47.927 --> 02:49.645
Just another day at the office.

02:50.554 --> 02:53.607
Ramiro, could you please help Mr. Goran
with his luggage, please?

02:54.141 --> 02:55.525
No, it's okay. I'm good.

02:56.143 --> 02:59.529
I insist. Ramiro, please help Mr. Goran
with his luggage.

03:01.774 --> 03:03.075
Have a pleasant evening.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.827
[Ramiro] Right over here, sir.

03:07.905 --> 03:10.874
Mr. Goran, sir,
I'm a big, huge fan of yours.

03:11.075 --> 03:12.668
I've watched every single fight.

03:13.243 --> 03:15.712
I even saw that Reno one,
the one you busted your knee in.

03:16.038 --> 03:17.756
Man, you definitely got robbed.

03:18.123 --> 03:20.290
Yeah, I used to do this fighting thing,

03:20.292 --> 03:22.918
but now I just hang out
at the local underground fight club.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.346
Have you ever been there?

03:25.005 --> 03:26.390
I'm not from around here.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.267
Oh, you're just visiting.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.726
Something like that.

03:30.094 --> 03:32.803
Well, they have fights every weekend.
Like, tonight they have one.

03:32.805 --> 03:34.022
Do you think you wanna go?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.900
Thanks, but maybe some other time.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.279
Well, if you change your mind,
just let me know.

03:40.729 --> 03:42.281
You think I could have your autograph?

03:43.107 --> 03:44.616
I don't do autographs, kid.

03:49.405 --> 03:50.706
Wow.

03:52.074 --> 03:53.375
[sighs]

03:59.248 --> 04:00.591
[Eva] Hi, baby.

04:04.253 --> 04:05.554
You're back early.

04:06.338 --> 04:09.099
- I missed you.
- I miss you, too, my love.

04:09.758 --> 04:11.101
So much.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.584
I love you.

04:36.368 --> 04:38.003
I love you, too, baby girl.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.311
[David] <i>You know...</i>

04:56.180 --> 04:57.898
I love everything about you.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.402
Even your flaws.

05:13.072 --> 05:15.040
Baby, I don't... I don't know.

05:20.913 --> 05:23.590
I just don't think I have
many more fights left in me.

05:26.835 --> 05:29.680
My love, we just have to pay him off.

05:30.881 --> 05:33.100
[sighs] We're on borrowed time here, Eva.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.310
We...

05:35.469 --> 05:36.812
We're running like animals.

05:37.596 --> 05:38.939
It's not my fault.

05:41.350 --> 05:42.859
You killed a man, Eva.

05:43.227 --> 05:44.736
It was self-defense.

05:45.521 --> 05:46.988
You don't know what happened.

05:47.439 --> 05:48.740
Maybe.

05:49.191 --> 05:52.411
But that pimp ex-boyfriend of yours,
he's never gonna let us go.

05:52.611 --> 05:54.329
He's gonna extort us forever.

05:55.239 --> 05:56.540
You know...

05:56.907 --> 05:59.000
I'm so sorry I brought you into this.

06:00.119 --> 06:03.036
It was all a long time ago.
It was a lifetime ago.

06:03.038 --> 06:04.339
You know...

06:05.249 --> 06:06.591
[sighs]

06:06.917 --> 06:08.969
Sometimes, I think I don't even know you.

06:09.962 --> 06:12.264
You know, I know that we all have secrets,
all right?

06:12.965 --> 06:15.225
But there's so much about you
that I don't even know.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.978
What's this?

06:19.221 --> 06:20.303
Please, David.

06:20.305 --> 06:22.357
- Are you taking clients again?
- No.

06:24.268 --> 06:26.486
There's twice as much money here
as there should be.

06:26.645 --> 06:28.029
What were the line odds?

06:28.147 --> 06:30.282
David, figure it out yourself.

06:32.484 --> 06:33.910
- Four-fifty.
- Yes.

06:33.944 --> 06:37.237
I took three dives to get the odds to 450.

06:37.239 --> 06:39.447
Now they're investigating me
for fight-fixing.

06:39.449 --> 06:41.992
And there's twice as much money here
as there should be.

06:41.994 --> 06:43.462
How did you get it, Eva?

06:43.829 --> 06:45.797
You must be wrong about the numbers.

06:45.914 --> 06:47.757
- Bullshit.
- Oh, please.

06:53.297 --> 06:54.764
Are you taking clients?

06:58.135 --> 06:59.478
Baby...

07:01.013 --> 07:03.315
Every time I see you stepping into a ring,

07:04.099 --> 07:06.735
I think it's going to be
the last time I see you.

07:08.270 --> 07:09.738
I can't let that happen.

07:10.772 --> 07:12.115
Not for me.

07:16.028 --> 07:17.370
No. Don't go.

07:17.654 --> 07:18.653
- Baby...
- You can't go.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.332
- I'm not gonna let you.
- Stop it!

07:21.325 --> 07:22.991
I won't allow it. I love you!

07:22.993 --> 07:25.545
- Let me go. Stop! Let me go. Stop it.
- [David grunts]

07:25.621 --> 07:28.121
You're not going.

07:28.123 --> 07:29.080
- Stop it.
- I love you.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.383
- Let me...
- [David grunts]

07:32.252 --> 07:33.553
[groans softly]

07:40.719 --> 07:42.395
[breathing heavily]

08:08.497 --> 08:11.049
I am not going to let you kill yourself...

08:11.917 --> 08:13.218
for me.

08:16.088 --> 08:17.430
I love you.

08:53.417 --> 08:55.760
Okay. What time?

08:59.631 --> 09:01.683
I get off in ten minutes. Wait here.

09:02.551 --> 09:04.936
[groovy instrumental music playing]

09:08.849 --> 09:10.150
[men grunting]

09:23.322 --> 09:24.404
[Ramiro in Spanish] Thank you.

09:24.406 --> 09:26.625
[man in Spanish]
The drinks are on the house.

09:27.326 --> 09:29.544
I'll get them for you in a bit.

09:29.911 --> 09:31.880
- [Ramiro in Spanish] Thank you very much.
- [man in Spanish] Excuse me.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.466
[Ramiro] We should hang out
more often, man.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.374
Drinks are on the house

09:36.376 --> 09:38.595
just 'cause they're so grateful
that you're here.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.724
And they say if you want to go up
on the ring, they'd be honored.

09:43.508 --> 09:46.811
I don't think so.
It's not gonna happen, Ramiro.

09:47.512 --> 09:48.897
It's all about the money now,

09:49.890 --> 09:51.274
and that's all it's about.

09:51.683 --> 09:53.183
- Pour me a drink.
- Yeah.

09:53.185 --> 09:54.527
I’m thirsty.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.871
[grunts]

10:07.574 --> 10:08.750
[Ramiro] Dives?

10:08.992 --> 10:10.835
You're... You're taking dives now?

10:12.454 --> 10:14.422
Just helping the numbers a little,
you know?

10:15.791 --> 10:18.885
[stutters] I would not mess
with those people, David.

10:20.545 --> 10:21.972
They're not gonna find out.

10:23.882 --> 10:25.475
How long have you been together?

10:28.512 --> 10:30.230
Met her after the Reno fight.

10:31.348 --> 10:33.316
She was in the crowd. Couldn't miss her.

10:34.226 --> 10:36.069
[scoffs] She was beautiful.

10:38.188 --> 10:39.739
We've been together ever since.

10:43.527 --> 10:44.953
I love her, man.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.579
She's the reason I fight.

10:48.365 --> 10:50.834
You are one of the oldest fighters
in the ring,

10:51.076 --> 10:52.836
and you got your knee thing.

10:53.078 --> 10:54.421
[David sighs deeply]

10:54.538 --> 10:56.339
And you gotta know when to quit, right?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.959
If it wasn't for this shit with Eva,
I would've been long gone.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.221
[grunting and groaning]

11:03.422 --> 11:08.101
You know, I've made more bookies
more money than I've ever seen.

11:08.343 --> 11:09.686
And look at me now.

11:11.012 --> 11:13.732
Hiding from some low-budget pimp
south of the border.

11:16.059 --> 11:17.360

11:44.045 --> 11:45.430
[Ramiro chuckles]

11:46.673 --> 11:48.016
Fuck you, too.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.979
Shot. Tequila, man.

14:47.812 --> 14:49.113
Ev, it's me.

15:00.909 --> 15:02.210
Shit.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.551
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

15:11.169 --> 15:13.179
My key card's not working.

15:13.797 --> 15:15.640
- Room?
- One-thirteen.

15:15.799 --> 15:18.184
- One-thirteen, let me check.
- [typing]

15:23.181 --> 15:25.817
No, I'm afraid that room is empty, sir.

15:26.434 --> 15:27.819
She checked out?

15:28.269 --> 15:29.570
Who, sir?

15:29.980 --> 15:32.407
My girlfriend. The woman
that's been staying there with me.

15:33.441 --> 15:34.867
[sighs] Okay.

15:41.825 --> 15:43.032
No.

15:43.034 --> 15:45.461
It says here
that room's been empty for a week.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.245
[scoffs]

15:47.247 --> 15:48.621
That's not possible.

15:48.623 --> 15:50.508
We've been staying here
for the last month.

15:52.002 --> 15:54.095
Maybe there's been a mistake, sir.
What is your name?

15:54.504 --> 15:56.931
- Goran. David Goran.
- [typing]

15:59.300 --> 16:00.601
David Goran?

16:00.927 --> 16:02.228
Yeah.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.776
- What's wrong?
- I just need to make a call.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.906
What seems to be the problem?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.242
Oh, this is the man from, uh...

16:17.569 --> 16:18.870
How may I help you?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.873
My key card doesn't work.
I need to get a new one.

16:22.657 --> 16:25.793
- Absolutely. What's the room number?
- One-thirteen.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.212
One-thirteen? That's impossible, sir.

16:28.538 --> 16:30.506
That room's been vacant for the past week.

16:30.999 --> 16:32.800
[receptionist] That's what I told him,
but he's...

16:34.794 --> 16:36.095
[scoffs]

16:36.796 --> 16:38.139
Hey, it's me, man.

16:38.882 --> 16:40.183
I'm sorry?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.143
We talk every day.

16:42.886 --> 16:45.313
Last night you congratulated me
on my fight.

16:46.848 --> 16:48.316
We've never met.

16:51.269 --> 16:52.612
He says he's, uh...

16:52.937 --> 16:54.103
[whispers] David Goran.

16:54.105 --> 16:57.033
[clears throat] I see. One second.

16:58.193 --> 16:59.786
What's the problem? What's going on here?

17:01.905 --> 17:05.249
Is there any way you could come down
to the front desk, please? Thanks.

17:05.282 --> 17:06.626
Where's my girlfriend?

17:06.951 --> 17:09.712
Sir, we can settle this
in just a matter of minutes.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.256
Where the hell is my girlfriend?

17:12.290 --> 17:14.050
I don't know, sir. Please don't hurt me.

18:51.306 --> 18:53.274
[captivating instrumental music playing]

19:09.616 --> 19:10.917
[in Spanish] Don't move.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.830
[grunts]

20:53.761 --> 20:55.062
Ramiro.

21:37.472 --> 21:39.690
Shit, David. You scared me, man.

21:40.016 --> 21:42.058
You're all over the news, man.
What'd you do?

21:42.060 --> 21:44.403
Everybody's looking for you.
They say you killed a guy.

21:44.854 --> 21:46.405
What? Who?

21:46.898 --> 21:48.282
Some fighter. Sit down, man.

21:59.202 --> 22:00.878
What the hell happened last night, man?

22:01.037 --> 22:02.380
We did shots, man.

22:02.663 --> 22:03.964
Uh, sure we did.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.010
I can't remember anything
after that tequila.

22:08.503 --> 22:10.262
Did I even fight that big guy?

22:10.838 --> 22:12.630
I don't remember, man.
We were pretty wasted.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.183
[phone ringing]

22:19.806 --> 22:21.107
Yeah, hello?

22:24.268 --> 22:26.070
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

22:28.481 --> 22:29.824
David.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.408
Hello?

22:41.410 --> 22:44.046
[robotic voice] <i>Is this the David Goran?</i>

22:45.706 --> 22:47.081
Who's this?

22:47.083 --> 22:50.011
<i>This is the person who has your woman.</i>

22:50.711 --> 22:53.597
<i>How quickly things fall apart.
Wouldn't you say?</i>

22:56.342 --> 22:57.633
Where is she?

22:57.635 --> 22:59.603
<i>She's safe for now.</i>

23:00.096 --> 23:03.774
<i>Go to the Bullpen Fight Club,
where you were last night.</i>

23:04.851 --> 23:07.195
<i>Find the back door and knock once.</i>

23:07.728 --> 23:08.894
<i>Be ready to fight.</i>

23:08.896 --> 23:11.240
Fight who? Why?

23:11.440 --> 23:13.075
<i>Because that's what we do.</i>

23:13.943 --> 23:16.620
<i>You fight, I run the books.</i>

23:16.654 --> 23:20.082
<i>If you want to see her again,
don't be late.</i>

23:24.745 --> 23:26.088
What was that about?

23:31.169 --> 23:32.470
I gotta go.

23:34.297 --> 23:35.639
Everything okay?

23:36.632 --> 23:37.975
David?

23:40.136 --> 23:42.062
David, everything okay?

23:42.138 --> 23:43.522
[door closes]

23:44.182 --> 23:45.483
Guess not.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.780

24:06.495 --> 24:07.796
[robotic voice] <i>Hello, David.</i>

24:07.997 --> 24:10.591
<i>And welcome to the Bullpen Fight Club.</i>

24:13.628 --> 24:14.929
What now?

24:25.765 --> 24:28.067
Think I'm gonna fight this guy for you?

24:28.935 --> 24:30.277
Why the hell should I?

24:30.937 --> 24:32.238
[Eva] <i>David.</i>

24:32.772 --> 24:35.272
Eva?

24:35.274 --> 24:36.742
<i>Baby, are you there?</i>

24:37.151 --> 24:38.536
Where are you, baby?

24:39.362 --> 24:40.704
Talk to me.

24:40.821 --> 24:42.372
[robotic voice] <i>Which you will soon.</i>

24:43.074 --> 24:45.668
<i>You fight or she dies.</i>

24:50.706 --> 24:52.007
<i>Ready?</i>

25:08.224 --> 25:09.525
[robotic voice] <i>Fight.</i>

25:09.934 --> 25:11.277
[grunts]

26:18.794 --> 26:20.095
[groans]

26:25.718 --> 26:27.102
[screams]

26:47.281 --> 26:48.582
Where is she?

26:49.617 --> 26:51.126
I wanna talk to Eva.

26:51.952 --> 26:53.670
[robotic voice] <i>In due time, David.</i>

26:54.246 --> 26:55.714
<i>In due time.</i>

26:58.626 --> 27:00.010
[groans]

27:13.974 --> 27:15.526
I wish I knew who was doing this.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.112
Who's fucking with my life.

27:19.355 --> 27:22.241
Look, David, the club is owned
by this guy named Delgado.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.119
Nobody has ever seen him before.

27:25.486 --> 27:27.037
They don't even know what he looks like.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.864
Trafficking, piracy, casinos.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.167
Off-track betting?

27:33.369 --> 27:34.837
Yeah, probably.

27:36.163 --> 27:37.464
[David sighs]

27:40.709 --> 27:44.346
We were placing our own bets
to an off-track betting office in cash.

27:46.257 --> 27:47.599
Shit, man.

27:48.175 --> 27:49.560
That's how they made you.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.271
How they found out you were fixing fights.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.066
Yeah. Probably.

27:58.018 --> 27:59.611
Do you know who this is, man?

27:59.937 --> 28:01.613
No, you don't know who he is.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.866
Even gangsters are afraid of him, man.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.859
Every time you hear about
somebody hanging off a bridge

28:06.861 --> 28:08.203
with their head cut off?

28:08.654 --> 28:10.539
Chances are Delgado did it.

28:11.198 --> 28:12.666
Some serious shit.

28:17.121 --> 28:18.839
All right, I get it.

28:20.791 --> 28:22.468
Question is, what do I do now?

28:23.752 --> 28:26.930
Can't go to the cops,
they're on the payroll.

28:29.717 --> 28:31.226
Just don't lose, man.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.062
[David sighs]

28:40.811 --> 28:42.362
I need to ask you a favor.

28:44.982 --> 28:47.034
Can you get me back into my hotel room?

28:48.944 --> 28:50.871
Yeah. I can do that.

28:52.323 --> 28:54.833
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

30:13.529 --> 30:15.789
Just wait here. Okay?

30:33.215 --> 30:35.601
Hold on, I have a question regarding...

30:36.135 --> 30:38.343
- Miss Nancy Vasquez' account.
- [woman] Mm-hmm.

30:38.345 --> 30:40.230
- Could you pull it up for me, please?
- [woman] Okay.

30:43.350 --> 30:45.527
- I just have a few questions.
- [woman] Mm-hmm.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.046
Well...

31:19.345 --> 31:20.896
Jesus Christ.

31:22.973 --> 31:24.691
I could lose my job for this.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.413
[man] Excuse me?

31:41.408 --> 31:43.502
- How may I help you?
- Agent Fonseca.

31:43.786 --> 31:45.337
Ministerial Police, PFP.

32:26.954 --> 32:28.839
[Ramiro] Are you sure
this is the right room?

32:29.790 --> 32:31.133
Yeah, I'm sure.

32:39.633 --> 32:43.228
[Ramiro] Well, if you can't find anything,
we're gonna have to bail.

32:44.304 --> 32:45.731
Just give me a moment.

33:10.873 --> 33:12.257
[David] Hey.

33:12.916 --> 33:14.259
- What did...
- [shushing]

33:18.172 --> 33:21.350
You have to understand,
if anyone knew about this...

33:25.971 --> 33:28.023
I really appreciate your cooperation.

33:32.686 --> 33:34.988
Well, Agent, this is the room.

33:35.522 --> 33:36.990
I need information.

33:37.733 --> 33:40.243
You gotta know somebody
who can tell us where Eva is.

33:41.528 --> 33:43.121
No.

33:43.781 --> 33:46.458
I just did something
that could have made me lose my job.

33:46.992 --> 33:49.336
Are you talking about something
that can get me killed?

33:50.496 --> 33:51.922
Sorry, man, but I'm out.

33:53.791 --> 33:55.133
Come on, man.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.552
These people have my girlfriend.

33:59.630 --> 34:02.766
You're all I've got.
You gotta know somebody.

34:18.482 --> 34:19.824
Yeah.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.701
I know somebody.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.663
He says he works for Delgado.

34:25.739 --> 34:28.708
But, David, if they make me...

34:30.369 --> 34:31.909
I'm a dead man.

34:31.911 --> 34:34.505
It's not gonna happen,
it's not gonna come to that.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.636
Come on, Ramiro, you're my last chance.

34:40.504 --> 34:42.054
You gotta take me to him.

34:45.926 --> 34:48.311
Yeah. Okay.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.690
Thanks, dude.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.610
Let's go.

35:04.778 --> 35:06.788
[suspenseful instrumental music playing]

35:35.309 --> 35:36.818
[engine revving]

36:26.485 --> 36:27.911
[tires screeching]

36:29.988 --> 36:31.289
[grunts]

36:37.454 --> 36:40.674
Well, I'm hoping that you got
all the information that you needed.

36:40.958 --> 36:43.969
With that being said, thank you very much,

36:44.586 --> 36:47.264
and if I can be of any other assistance,
just let me know.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.724
Thank you.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.735
- Just one more thing.
- Yes?

37:03.772 --> 37:06.074
- The fight across the street...
- Mm-hmm.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.202
- It was the same day?
- Yes.

37:10.487 --> 37:11.997
There are witnesses

37:12.155 --> 37:14.541
that say they were dressed like, um...

37:14.866 --> 37:17.460
security officer uniforms?

37:18.078 --> 37:20.338
That kind of stuff. Were they yours?

37:20.497 --> 37:21.840
Who?

37:23.458 --> 37:24.759
The fighters.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.334
Oh.

37:26.336 --> 37:28.346
I was behind the desk helping people.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.922
You mean you wouldn't know

37:30.924 --> 37:33.184
if one of your employees
left the building?

37:34.553 --> 37:38.064
The only thing I could tell you is that
some of our staff did go missing that day.

37:38.473 --> 37:42.110
I don't know what happened next,
but unfortunately we let them go.

37:43.478 --> 37:44.821
You fired them?

37:45.105 --> 37:47.324
Yes, promptly after the whole situation.

37:52.279 --> 37:55.530
Well, then, I'll need, um,
some personal information

37:55.532 --> 37:58.867
like home addresses, phone numbers,
that kind of stuff.

37:58.869 --> 38:00.327
I'm afraid I can't help you there.

38:00.329 --> 38:02.005
Unfortunately, they're not in our books.

38:03.540 --> 38:06.551
They're cash employees.
They're paid under the table.

38:07.461 --> 38:08.762
Hmm.

38:10.464 --> 38:11.806
It's funny.

38:12.674 --> 38:16.227
I couldn't find any employee information
about you, either.

38:17.387 --> 38:20.857
[clears throat] That's unfortunate.
There must be a mistake.

38:22.726 --> 38:24.069
Have a great day.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.822
You, too.

38:40.077 --> 38:42.535
I don't know, man. I'm just a cook.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.089
I work in the kitchen.

38:44.581 --> 38:45.924
He's lying, man.

38:46.291 --> 38:49.469
He's the driver, he should know something.
You know something, Manny!

38:50.587 --> 38:51.930
Where is she?

38:56.551 --> 38:57.852
[grunts]

39:04.601 --> 39:07.195
[Ramiro] David Goran
just asked you a question.

39:08.271 --> 39:10.573
Tell him where is the girl, Manny.

39:11.233 --> 39:13.410
Fuck you! I don't know!

39:17.030 --> 39:20.792
I’m just a cook. Come on, Ramiro.
You know a lot better than...

39:22.536 --> 39:24.170
- [David] That's enough.
- [Manny gasping]

39:25.288 --> 39:26.756
That's enough.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.175
Ramiro, that's enough.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.302
- He's no good to us if he can't talk.
- [coughs]

39:35.048 --> 39:38.977
Manny, listen to me.
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.146
Where is she, Manny?

39:41.513 --> 39:44.107
- I don't know, man.
- Where's my girlfriend?

39:44.474 --> 39:45.900
I don't know.

39:46.268 --> 39:47.819
Well, who would know?

39:49.271 --> 39:50.572
I'm just a cook.

39:51.481 --> 39:55.410
I work in the kitchen.
I just wanted a fucking chance. Man.

39:56.445 --> 39:57.787
Why'd you run?

39:58.780 --> 40:02.542
It's Mexico. Come on, everybody runs here.

40:10.792 --> 40:12.761
It's getting late. I gotta go.

40:13.420 --> 40:14.763
Can I use your car?

40:14.838 --> 40:16.181
Yeah, sure.

40:20.051 --> 40:22.020
Keep an eye on him. I'll be back.

40:25.515 --> 40:27.108
Don't scratch the car.

40:31.104 --> 40:32.729
[in Spanish] What's up, Manny?

40:32.731 --> 40:34.324
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

40:37.152 --> 40:38.536
[robotic voice] <i>Fight.</i>

42:15.834 --> 42:17.218

42:42.527 --> 42:46.205
[robotic voice] <i>Impressive, David.
For a man your age.</i>

42:53.079 --> 42:54.756
Are you happy, now?

42:55.707 --> 42:57.300
Is this what you want?

42:58.793 --> 43:00.303
[David groaning]

43:01.004 --> 43:03.431
I'm tired of this shit, Delgado.

43:04.591 --> 43:06.351
<i>You're being dramatic, David.</i>

43:07.260 --> 43:08.561
<i>Get some rest.</i>

43:08.928 --> 43:10.604
<i>We've got more money to make.</i>

[door closes]

43:30.867 --> 43:32.210
Ramiro?

43:34.704 --> 43:36.464
What the hell did you do, dude?

43:40.293 --> 43:41.719
I killed him.

43:42.629 --> 43:43.753
[Ramiro sighs]

43:43.755 --> 43:45.390
I didn't mean to, he just...

43:46.383 --> 43:49.060
He kinda tried to attack me
and I had to shoot him.

43:51.012 --> 43:52.772
- I'm really sorry, dude.
- [David sighs]

43:57.143 --> 43:58.695
Look, man, it was an accident.

43:59.312 --> 44:00.780
I really didn't mean to.

44:10.573 --> 44:12.750
The fuck are we gonna do now, dude?

44:13.410 --> 44:15.336
We just gotta get the body outta here.

44:17.330 --> 44:18.631
Okay?

44:21.000 --> 44:22.301
Okay?

44:24.754 --> 44:26.055
Come on, David, help me.

44:30.635 --> 44:32.854
Grab the legs, David, come on.

44:34.055 --> 44:35.356
[sighs]

44:48.903 --> 44:51.205
- [Ramiro] Manny stinks.
- Yeah.

45:29.444 --> 45:31.287
- Gentlemen.
- How you doing?

45:47.170 --> 45:49.430
What are the Feds doing
at a local crime scene?

45:53.259 --> 45:54.717
You know, it's funny.

45:54.719 --> 45:58.523
Because this is exactly like Guadalajara
six months ago.

45:59.098 --> 46:01.150
Another dead fighter.

46:02.268 --> 46:05.404
And I am investigating the case.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.333
Look.

46:19.786 --> 46:21.420
It's not a serial killer.

46:21.871 --> 46:25.174
It's a fucking gang-related shooting,
that's it.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.499
Go wait in the car, man.

46:26.501 --> 46:28.594
- Just calm down, okay?
- Just go, please.

46:44.060 --> 46:45.403
Drop it.

46:47.897 --> 46:49.407
I don't know what you're doing here.

46:50.066 --> 46:53.536
Don't you have some ghost named Delgado
to go look for?

46:54.112 --> 46:55.788
We don't like the Feds around here.

46:57.574 --> 46:59.709
So just stay out of my territory.

47:04.372 --> 47:05.715
You know...

47:08.543 --> 47:10.303
If I were you, I'd watch my back.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.514
You're a long way from home.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.642
Officer.

47:26.185 --> 47:27.862
What I don't understand...

47:28.855 --> 47:31.856
is if they were here so long,

47:31.858 --> 47:34.577
how come you don't even have
a billing address?

47:37.155 --> 47:38.539
Who are you referring to?

47:40.283 --> 47:42.668
Goran. David Goran.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.136
If you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere to be.

47:58.384 --> 47:59.727
Sorry.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.987
I'm looking for Goran, David Goran.

48:11.856 --> 48:13.105
You know, the fighter?

48:13.107 --> 48:15.024
Knocked out Fernandez in the first round?

48:15.026 --> 48:16.619
Did you see that? You get cable here?

48:19.405 --> 48:20.706
He's not here, man.

48:22.700 --> 48:24.001
He checked out.

48:25.953 --> 48:27.254
[groans]

48:28.373 --> 48:30.466
Are you sure?

48:30.625 --> 48:32.051
Ouch.

48:33.211 --> 48:34.595
Where is he?

48:35.213 --> 48:38.307
David, come on, let's go, man.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:50.099
Come on. We've got to go!

01:17:51.259 --> 01:17:52.560
Come on!

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:55.886
- Go!
- Come on!

01:17:55.888 --> 01:17:58.441
- [Fonseca] What? What's the rush?
- [David] It's gonna blow.

01:17:59.767 --> 01:18:01.527
Hurry. Let's go.

01:18:03.438 --> 01:18:04.864
[beeping]

01:18:12.029 --> 01:18:13.414
[Eva] Jesus Christ.

01:18:13.781 --> 01:18:15.666
- [David] Eva, are you okay?
- [Eva] Yes.

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:26.218
Do you know this Delgado character?

01:18:26.878 --> 01:18:29.680
I've been in his trail for six years.
He's like a ghost.

01:18:29.964 --> 01:18:31.922
The international drug trade slowed,

01:18:31.924 --> 01:18:34.268
so he moved to high-stake fights.

01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:36.854
Everything he can put away
from these fights

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:40.149
will be enough
to never hear from him again.

01:18:41.976 --> 01:18:43.819
So, how did you get to that place?

01:18:45.772 --> 01:18:47.698
There was a couple of young guys.

01:18:48.566 --> 01:18:50.034
I think they were fighters.

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:53.329
And there was this fat guy,

01:18:53.613 --> 01:18:54.997
I've seen him before.

01:18:57.116 --> 01:18:59.210
- In the hotel.
- Heavy guy?

01:18:59.285 --> 01:19:00.628
Yes.

01:19:01.162 --> 01:19:02.755
The front desk guy?

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:05.299
Yes, I think so.

01:19:06.751 --> 01:19:08.719
- [David] <i>Do you know him?</i>
- [Fonseca] <i>Of course I do.</i>

01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:10.304
You know where to find him?

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:13.099
- Where's the front desk guy?
- Who, sir?

01:19:13.174 --> 01:19:16.268
He's big, white shirt, he was here.

01:19:17.845 --> 01:19:19.188
Go in.

01:19:20.681 --> 01:19:21.982
Sit down!

01:19:24.018 --> 01:19:26.894
Listen to me, man. I'm not Delgado.

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:27.937
Shut up!

01:19:27.939 --> 01:19:29.615

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:35.287
[Fonseca] Shut up.

01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:37.456
Why are we here?

01:19:39.826 --> 01:19:41.127
How long you gonna need?

01:19:41.577 --> 01:19:43.160
[Fonseca] As long as it takes.

01:19:43.162 --> 01:19:45.339
- Okay, we're gonna get out of here.
- Fine.

01:19:45.998 --> 01:19:49.760
Hey, don't take too long.
They're gonna be looking for you.

01:19:50.795 --> 01:19:52.972
Don't worry. I'll take it from here.

01:19:54.549 --> 01:19:56.058
Come on. Let's go.

01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:58.352
- What are you gonna...
- Shut up.

01:20:03.516 --> 01:20:04.900
Shut up.

01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:07.319
Please.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:09.321
I'm not Delgado.

01:20:13.359 --> 01:20:15.411
Stay down. Wait here.

01:20:16.529 --> 01:20:17.830
Goran!

01:20:19.991 --> 01:20:21.584
[gunshots continue]

Drop it, Delgado! Drop it!

01:21:02.909 --> 01:21:04.251
Agent Fonseca.

01:21:04.702 --> 01:21:06.086
Nice to see you.

01:21:07.538 --> 01:21:09.548
Drop it. I got you cold.

01:21:11.751 --> 01:21:13.260

01:21:20.676 --> 01:21:22.019

That's not going to happen.

01:22:03.844 --> 01:22:05.010
Drop the gun.

Okay!

01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:12.152
Okay.

01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:16.448
How's that knee?

01:22:23.781 --> 01:22:26.750
Sorry about Reno. You know how this goes.

My God.

01:23:24.967 --> 01:23:27.353
Come on, baby, let's get out of here.

01:23:31.057 --> 01:23:34.068
[Eva] He was shooting me.
He was trying to kill me.

01:23:34.185 --> 01:23:37.863
It's okay. He's dead.
It's okay. It's over.

01:23:40.524 --> 01:23:41.825
My God.

01:23:43.861 --> 01:23:45.662
- Hang on a second.
- Okay.

01:23:50.701 --> 01:23:53.118
- You okay, buddy?
- Yeah, it was a clean shot.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.880
I think we need to get you to a hospital.

01:23:56.123 --> 01:23:58.165

It's okay, it's not your fault.

01:24:21.398 --> 01:24:23.617
It's okay, it's not your fault.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.537
He wanted to kill him.

01:24:28.572 --> 01:24:29.873
Let's go.

01:24:31.659 --> 01:24:32.960
Let's go.

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:36.046
He's been shot.

01:24:47.258 --> 01:24:48.924
Hey. How are you, guys?

01:24:48.926 --> 01:24:50.686
- Eva, how are you?
- Good.

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:54.471
Baby, it's a long trip, so I better go
to the bathroom before we go.

01:24:54.473 --> 01:24:55.816
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:57.391
- Don’t be long.
- I'll be back.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:58.694
Excuse me.

01:24:59.186 --> 01:25:00.571
How you doing?

01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:02.239
Ah, pretty good.

Do you know where you two will land?

01:25:07.444 --> 01:25:10.456
I have no idea,
and I kind of like it that way.

01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:12.291
Good.

01:25:12.908 --> 01:25:15.127
Um, just one more thing.

01:25:17.079 --> 01:25:18.881
Can I have your autograph?

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:21.425
Please. [chuckles]

01:25:22.877 --> 01:25:24.001
Of course you can.

01:25:24.003 --> 01:25:25.711
You know,
I should be asking you for yours.

01:25:25.713 --> 01:25:26.753
Yeah, sure.

01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:28.130
When you go back to Mexico City,

01:25:28.132 --> 01:25:30.132
you're gonna be a hero
after catching Delgado.

01:25:30.134 --> 01:25:32.561
Oh, I wish. There was a problem.

01:25:32.678 --> 01:25:36.356
There was never a legitimate fingerprint
taken from Delgado.

01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:39.651
The only known identifier is a birthmark,

01:25:40.436 --> 01:25:42.112
and the concierge didn't have it.

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.731
He must have had it
surgically removed or...

01:25:45.733 --> 01:25:47.201
To throw us off.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:49.953
Birthmark? What kind of birthmark?

01:25:50.404 --> 01:25:51.914
A heart-shaped birthmark.

01:25:56.493 --> 01:25:57.836

A half heart-shaped birthmark,
under the right arm.

01:26:19.767 --> 01:26:21.610
- Why?
- A what?

01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:24.655
