00:11.984 --> 00:16.821
25 years ago, God disappeared.

00:16.855 --> 00:19.057
His angels held man responsible,

00:19.091 --> 00:21.893
and declared war on humanity.

00:21.927 --> 00:24.562
The Archangel Gabriel led
this war of extermination,

00:24.597 --> 00:26.531
hoping to rid the world of humans

00:26.565 --> 00:31.035
and claim dominion over it.

00:31.070 --> 00:34.672
Some higher angels refused to take sides,

00:34.707 --> 00:37.976
but the lower angels joined Gabriel.

00:38.010 --> 00:39.944
These lesser spirits lacked bodies,

00:39.979 --> 00:45.016
so their first line of
attack was to steal ours.

00:45.050 --> 00:47.885
But Michael, the greatest
of all archangels,

00:47.920 --> 00:50.021
chose to fight for man.

00:50.055 --> 00:52.323
With his help, the survivors struck back

00:52.358 --> 00:56.628
and built strongholds to defend themselves.

00:56.662 --> 01:00.565
Soon, word spread of a
baby Michael had saved,

01:00.599 --> 01:03.501
a child who would grow
up to be mankind's savior.

01:03.535 --> 01:08.072
This chosen one would be known
by the markings on his body.

01:08.107 --> 01:11.409
Finally, Gabriel and his army retreated,

01:11.443 --> 01:13.211
and we were left with the realization

01:13.245 --> 01:15.613
that not only are angels real...

01:15.648 --> 01:18.650
they are our most hated enemies.

Join us.

02:56.048 --> 02:58.249
We have an empty seat.

03:40.692 --> 03:42.360
A. Lannon, pass code 2271.

03:42.394 --> 03:45.329
Open the gates.

03:45.364 --> 03:49.033
2271. Respond!

03:49.067 --> 03:51.369
A. Lannon, pass code 2271.

03:51.403 --> 03:54.739
I've got an angel in pursuit.

03:54.773 --> 03:56.174
- What have you got?
- 2271, respond!

03:56.208 --> 03:57.608
Distress call, sir. One of ours.

03:57.643 --> 03:58.810
Where the hell are you guys?

03:58.844 --> 04:00.211
Open the damn gate!

04:00.245 --> 04:01.646
Should I let him in, sir?

04:01.680 --> 04:02.914
Open the gate!

04:04.716 --> 04:06.584
2271. Open the damn gate...

04:21.834 --> 04:23.668
A. Lannon! Passcode...

04:32.778 --> 04:35.179
Warning, perimeter breach.

04:35.214 --> 04:37.949
Warning, perimeter breach.

05:10.082 --> 05:13.384
Now entering security zone five.

05:13.418 --> 05:16.954
Now entering security zone five.

05:22.628 --> 05:25.763
All right, all right, easy.

05:25.797 --> 05:27.398
Yeah, okay.

05:32.104 --> 05:34.038
Possession negative.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.207
Lannon!

05:36.241 --> 05:37.942
What the hell were you
doing outside the city

05:37.976 --> 05:39.410
without authorization?

05:39.444 --> 05:40.811
It was two-for-one
buffet at the Flamingo.

05:40.846 --> 05:43.247
I just couldn't miss it.
What do you think I was doing?

05:43.282 --> 05:45.383
You saw the eight ball.
It wasn't just one of 'em.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.951
There was a whole group of 'em.

05:46.985 --> 05:51.055
- We need to tell Riesen.
- No.

05:51.089 --> 05:53.391
Take him to the archangel.
He's one of his men.

05:53.425 --> 05:57.161
- Aw, man.
- I'll report to Riesen.

06:27.225 --> 06:29.093
You were a naughty boy tonight.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.962
You shouldn't indulge me.

06:30.996 --> 06:32.863
These evenings would be much more enjoyable

06:32.898 --> 06:34.632
if you didn't hate yourself after.

06:34.666 --> 06:37.134
Any risk, no matter how small,

06:37.169 --> 06:41.672
that I might have children is too great.

06:41.707 --> 06:45.443
Would it be such a bad thing?

06:45.477 --> 06:48.145
Vega needs children.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.681
Not children like that.

07:01.026 --> 07:03.894
This has to stop.

07:03.929 --> 07:06.297
Then stop.

07:41.366 --> 07:44.969
Market access is
restricted to V-4 and above.

07:46.905 --> 07:51.909
Market access is
restricted to V-4 and above.

07:58.784 --> 08:00.651
A regal Jubilee,

08:00.685 --> 08:02.520
only at the Whele Arena.

08:02.554 --> 08:04.989
Don't miss it!

08:21.773 --> 08:24.175
This city's going to hell.

08:35.687 --> 08:37.087
Exiting the city with a vehicle

08:37.121 --> 08:39.390
is a realigning offense.

08:39.424 --> 08:41.659
You're gonna get purged
down to V-0 for this.

08:41.693 --> 08:43.427
It's an untouchable.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.629
It's better than making
a home in Michael's ass

08:45.664 --> 08:50.901
to be a V-3 like you.

08:50.936 --> 08:52.169
How'd you do it?

08:52.204 --> 08:54.605
You reprogram one of the gates?

08:54.639 --> 08:57.975
Crack the surveillance?

09:03.648 --> 09:05.649
Leave the whip.

09:10.689 --> 09:13.924
You know the rules and why they exist.

09:13.959 --> 09:17.261
Everything in Vega has a purpose.

09:17.295 --> 09:20.431
That's how the city survives.

09:20.465 --> 09:21.832
Founding law.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.934
"For the protection and good of all,

09:23.969 --> 09:25.503
gates are inviolable."

09:25.537 --> 09:28.005
We have a right to leave. We all do.

09:28.039 --> 09:32.376
No, you don't.

09:32.410 --> 09:35.613
Tell me about the angels.

09:35.647 --> 09:40.551
There were three of 'em, all eight balls.

09:40.585 --> 09:43.053
But something about them was different.

09:43.088 --> 09:45.890
One of them could change his body.

09:45.924 --> 09:47.958
A soldier.

09:47.993 --> 09:51.829
He had wings.

09:51.863 --> 09:53.731
Where were they?

09:53.765 --> 09:55.466
A couple miles down the strip.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.903
- What were they doing?
- Playing Texas hold 'em.

09:58.937 --> 10:01.672
Not kidding.

10:01.706 --> 10:03.507
And what were you doing out there?

10:07.546 --> 10:10.814
You know the punishment
for going outside the walls.

10:10.849 --> 10:12.550
I'm gonna be purged?

10:12.584 --> 10:16.987
No, you're Archangel Corps.

10:17.022 --> 10:19.890
But if you ever do
anything like this again,

10:19.925 --> 10:22.760
I'll not spare you.

10:22.794 --> 10:25.863
Do you understand me?

10:28.466 --> 10:31.802
Stand up.

10:44.115 --> 10:46.717
I think that's enough, Michael.

10:46.751 --> 10:49.620
He's learned his lesson.

10:49.654 --> 10:53.757
Right, boy?

10:53.792 --> 10:58.562
Tell no one about what you saw.

10:58.597 --> 11:02.933
Not a word about the eight balls to anyone.

11:04.302 --> 11:06.503
Now, go report for duty.

11:09.241 --> 11:11.942
He shouldn't be outside the walls.

11:11.977 --> 11:13.577
The ruins are too dangerous.

11:13.612 --> 11:16.647
The boy has been sneaking
out since he was a child.

11:16.681 --> 11:18.415
He knows Vega better than anyone.

11:18.450 --> 11:21.819
- He needs discipline.
- Perhaps.

11:21.853 --> 11:23.153
But after what he did for Claire,

11:23.188 --> 11:24.555
I owe him.

11:24.589 --> 11:26.757
The eight ball came right up to the gate.

11:26.791 --> 11:29.159
They're back.

11:33.765 --> 11:35.165
In the war,

11:35.200 --> 11:38.202
the entire lower rank
of angels joined Gabriel,

11:38.236 --> 11:40.304
but unlike archangels,

11:40.338 --> 11:43.173
Gabriel's lower angels, the dogs of heaven,

11:43.208 --> 11:46.644
they were lesser spirits
without a physical form,

11:46.678 --> 11:49.680
and they couldn't visit
earth without a body,

11:49.714 --> 11:53.083
so they stole ours.

11:53.118 --> 11:57.554
Then came whispers of a chosen child

11:57.589 --> 12:02.059
who would grow up to lead
mankind out of darkness,

12:02.093 --> 12:06.397
and his legend quickly
spread, giving humanity hope,

12:06.431 --> 12:09.400
a reason to fight back,

12:09.434 --> 12:12.169
and the angels hated it.

12:12.203 --> 12:15.172
Now, it's said that Michael acted alone,

12:15.206 --> 12:18.509
saved the child, and hid him in such a way

12:18.543 --> 12:21.178
that not even Michael knows where he is.

12:21.212 --> 12:23.614
- You're late.
- Yeah, sorry, I got held up.

12:23.648 --> 12:26.884
- Asshole.
- You're an asshole.

12:26.918 --> 12:29.353
We continue to hope...

12:29.387 --> 12:33.023
No, to believe that the chosen one,

12:33.058 --> 12:35.959
our savior,

12:35.994 --> 12:39.430
will someday reveal himself to us.

12:46.004 --> 12:47.404
Is there anything else

12:47.439 --> 12:50.441
I can help you with tonight, ma'am?

12:57.248 --> 12:58.615
What happened to your head?

12:58.650 --> 13:00.084
There were eight balls by the truck.

13:00.118 --> 13:01.552
What?

13:01.586 --> 13:03.153
Your father told me not to say anything,

13:03.188 --> 13:04.254
so you have to keep quiet.

13:04.289 --> 13:05.723
Alex, they attacked you.

13:05.757 --> 13:09.126
That's what they do. I'm fine.

13:12.497 --> 13:13.664
You need to speak to your dad.

13:13.698 --> 13:16.500
I know. I know. I will tonight.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.768
I've asked to see him.

13:17.802 --> 13:19.169
I'll tell him about us,

13:19.204 --> 13:21.772
and I will get his permission to marry.

13:21.806 --> 13:24.742
But you still have to do
the knee and the ring thing.

13:24.776 --> 13:28.612
It just so happens I
have a knee and a ring.

13:33.151 --> 13:35.018
What?

13:35.053 --> 13:37.521
Alex, he'll say yes. Trust me.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.490
I know him.

13:39.524 --> 13:43.627
You're my shield. You took a knife for me.

13:43.661 --> 13:47.931
There is no me without you.

13:47.966 --> 13:49.867
We're different, you and I.

13:49.901 --> 13:51.301
Yeah, what?

13:51.336 --> 13:52.836
You think you know him better than I do.

13:52.871 --> 13:54.638
I know the system better than you.

13:54.672 --> 13:56.273
Claire, the truck is ready.

13:56.307 --> 13:58.709
We have enough supplies to
easily make it to Delphi.

13:58.743 --> 14:02.112
Claire, they don't have numbers there.

14:02.147 --> 14:04.148
Everyone is equal.

14:04.182 --> 14:06.683
We could start a new life,

14:06.718 --> 14:08.552
but it's got to be tomorrow night.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.287
The city will be busy with the Jubilee,

14:10.321 --> 14:11.989
and you could slip out.

14:12.023 --> 14:15.025
But it won't come to that. He'll say yes.

14:15.059 --> 14:19.496
But if he doesn't,

14:19.531 --> 14:23.133
wherever you go,

14:23.168 --> 14:26.370
I follow.

14:26.404 --> 14:28.272
Okay?

14:37.749 --> 14:41.552
What's your name, soldier?

14:41.586 --> 14:44.855
Alex Lannon, V-2. The
House Riesen, AA Corp.

14:44.889 --> 14:47.391
Alex Lannon.

14:47.425 --> 14:49.893
It's against our law for you
to be alone with Claire, Alex,

14:49.928 --> 14:52.696
so next time make sure

14:52.730 --> 14:56.200
you're accompanied by another guard.

14:59.304 --> 15:02.239
- Principate.
- Please, Claire, not you.

15:02.273 --> 15:03.707
I'm still the same William

15:03.741 --> 15:05.275
you played marbles with in this room.

15:05.310 --> 15:08.779
Yes, and always be.

15:08.813 --> 15:10.848
Yeah, maybe you should call me Principate.

15:10.882 --> 15:13.917
It does sound much better
when it comes from you.

15:13.952 --> 15:15.752
You missed services tonight.

15:15.787 --> 15:18.755
- I was teaching.
- That's right.

15:18.790 --> 15:22.392
You know, I admire your work
with Vega's less fortunate.

15:22.427 --> 15:25.229
You of all people know how important it is

15:25.263 --> 15:26.630
that our faith must be nurtured.

15:26.664 --> 15:31.768
It must be kept like a promise.

15:31.803 --> 15:34.404
It troubles me that so
many of Vega's citizens

15:34.439 --> 15:37.941
have forgotten this simple truth.

15:39.911 --> 15:42.713
Yes.

15:42.747 --> 15:45.816
- Well, let us pray.
- Yes.

16:08.873 --> 16:10.908
Hey, Bix.

16:10.942 --> 16:12.576
What'd you do now?

16:12.610 --> 16:14.912
I got on the wrong side of the peacock.

16:14.946 --> 16:16.513
Riesen stepped in.

16:16.548 --> 16:18.615
You should keep out of
anything to do with the tops.

16:18.650 --> 16:20.150
Yeah, they're no different than us.

16:20.184 --> 16:21.618
They just got a better number.

16:26.391 --> 16:29.393
When's the last time you ate?

16:29.427 --> 16:31.562
Here. I ate at the palace.

16:36.167 --> 16:39.002
You want to know a secret?

16:39.037 --> 16:42.806
One day, we're gonna live somewhere

16:42.840 --> 16:45.342
where there aren't any numbers,

16:45.376 --> 16:47.811
where we aren't told
what to do, what to eat,

16:47.845 --> 16:51.448
where to sleep, and whom to marry.

16:51.482 --> 16:54.351
One day, we're gonna be free.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.821
- Promise?
- I promise.

17:04.729 --> 17:07.698
Stay close the next day or so.

17:07.732 --> 17:09.665
Something big's gonna happen,

17:09.701 --> 17:14.003
and whichever way it goes,
you're coming with me.

17:22.680 --> 17:26.650
- Consul.
- General.

17:26.684 --> 17:29.219
Oh, lookee here.

17:29.253 --> 17:30.754
I asked the horticulturist

17:30.788 --> 17:35.359
to grow these on the agri-towers.

17:37.562 --> 17:41.365
I never much cared for berries.

17:45.403 --> 17:47.004
There was an angel attack on a soldier

17:47.038 --> 17:49.873
outside the walls today.

17:49.907 --> 17:51.675
Small group, three angels.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.343
Easily destroyed.

17:53.378 --> 17:57.581
Not all of 'em. One survived.

17:59.317 --> 18:02.786
Don't worry. It's been taken care of.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.122
But the archangel is concerned,

18:05.156 --> 18:07.891
and you should be too.

18:07.925 --> 18:11.128
Michael sees evil portent
in everything and everyone.

18:13.164 --> 18:15.465
It was an isolated incident, nothing more.

18:15.500 --> 18:19.102
No further sightings
on our long-range scans.

18:19.137 --> 18:21.371
We deployed the drone.

18:21.406 --> 18:24.941
All clear.

18:24.976 --> 18:27.477
We don't want it getting out.

18:27.512 --> 18:29.613
It could cause panic.

18:29.647 --> 18:32.482
Perhaps that wouldn't be a bad thing.

18:32.517 --> 18:35.385
We've done our jobs too well.

18:35.420 --> 18:39.956
Vega has grown complacent, lazy.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.228
So are you looking forward

18:45.263 --> 18:47.664
to the announcement at the Jubilee?

18:47.699 --> 18:51.168
Yes.

18:51.202 --> 18:53.470
Tomorrow, then.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.776
I've been guarding David
Whele for six months.

18:59.811 --> 19:02.312
I finally saw what he
feeds that tiger of his.

19:02.346 --> 19:04.481
It's not a tiger. It's a lion.

19:04.515 --> 19:05.949
Is there a difference?

19:05.983 --> 19:07.517
- Yeah, stripes.
- Whatever.

19:07.552 --> 19:11.354
It gets steak for dinner...
dry-aged porterhouse.

19:11.389 --> 19:13.123
When was the last time
you even tasted beef?

19:13.157 --> 19:15.325
Cat's one of a kind. We're a dime a dozen.

19:15.359 --> 19:17.127
Speak for yourself.

19:17.161 --> 19:19.096
- Hey, boys.
- Noma.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.997
Hey, Ethan, can you weasel your way

19:21.032 --> 19:22.532
into a bottle of Scotch for me tonight?

19:22.567 --> 19:24.267
"Weasel"? Really?

19:24.302 --> 19:27.337
- She means charm your way.
- Nooo... I mean "Weasel"!

19:29.240 --> 19:31.108
You know what goes great with Scotch, Noma?

19:31.142 --> 19:34.277
Porterhouse steak, and I can get some.

19:34.312 --> 19:35.846
My gift to you.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.180
Alex, I'll grab one for you too.

19:37.215 --> 19:38.982
We're gonna eat like tigers tonight.

19:39.016 --> 19:42.185
- Lions.
- Tigers.

19:42.220 --> 19:43.954
You've been logging some serious overtime

19:43.988 --> 19:46.056
- at House Riesen.
- I go where I'm told.

19:46.090 --> 19:49.860
So General Riesen's just
decided to tighten security?

19:49.894 --> 19:52.696
Why wouldn't he? He's lord of the city.

19:52.730 --> 19:54.498
The man's concerned about
his daughter's safety.

19:54.532 --> 19:57.200
Who said anything about his daughter?

19:57.235 --> 19:58.702
No one.

19:58.736 --> 20:01.138
It's just you know how he is about Claire.

20:01.172 --> 20:04.407
Yeah.

20:04.442 --> 20:06.009
He cares a lot about her, doesn't he?

20:24.362 --> 20:25.729
Don't the Wheles ever sleep?

20:25.763 --> 20:27.964
Not if there's money to be made.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.104
It's a delegation from Helena.

20:34.138 --> 20:35.505
It's been a while since you seen anyone

20:35.540 --> 20:37.007
from Helena around in these walls.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.075
Have you ever seen one
of their kids before?

20:39.110 --> 20:41.778
They keep 'em hidden. It's their law.

20:43.414 --> 20:47.450
You think that kid's the one?

20:47.485 --> 20:48.952
The chosen one's a myth.

20:48.986 --> 20:50.420
That's something they tell children

20:50.454 --> 20:53.256
to give them hope.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.225
I don't understand why you'd have me travel

20:55.259 --> 20:58.395
all this way to see
another of your factories.

20:58.429 --> 21:01.464
Well, this isn't one of our factories.

21:01.499 --> 21:04.201
Has Evelyn considered my proposal?

21:04.235 --> 21:06.536
She's not ready to join
in a treaty with you

21:06.571 --> 21:09.039
which may pit us against New Delphi.

21:09.073 --> 21:10.874
Trading, yes.

21:10.908 --> 21:13.877
Armaments, a mutual defense pact,

21:13.911 --> 21:17.948
not now.

21:17.982 --> 21:22.052
Evelyn wished to give you this.

21:22.086 --> 21:23.720
A derringer.

21:23.754 --> 21:26.389
One of these killed Abraham Lincoln.

21:33.431 --> 21:35.265
A thoughtful gift.

21:35.299 --> 21:38.969
You obviously learned a lot
about me on your last visit.

21:39.003 --> 21:41.471
A passion for weapons is hard to forget.

21:41.505 --> 21:42.939
I would prefer you remember me

21:42.974 --> 21:46.142
for something more inspiring.

21:46.177 --> 21:50.113
- And what would that be?
- Hope.

22:00.124 --> 22:03.693
Gone are the days when
darkness is something to fear.

22:06.530 --> 22:08.531
With this technology,

22:08.566 --> 22:11.034
the lights of Vega will
shine as a beacon of hope

22:11.068 --> 22:15.205
for 1,000 years.

22:15.239 --> 22:19.476
Along with food and our medicines,

22:19.510 --> 22:21.478
I can offer 500 brides,

22:21.512 --> 22:24.547
all of childbearing age,

22:24.582 --> 22:26.116
in exchange for the technology

22:26.150 --> 22:28.518
to build our own reactor.

22:28.552 --> 22:31.021
There'll be time to negotiate later.

22:31.055 --> 22:33.323
My men will show you the bungalows

22:33.357 --> 22:34.891
where you can rest and freshen up

22:34.926 --> 22:38.828
after your flight.

22:38.863 --> 22:40.163
Thank you, David.

22:40.197 --> 22:41.698
And tomorrow night,

22:41.732 --> 22:43.333
you'll be my guests at the yearly Jubilee

22:43.367 --> 22:45.168
in the Grand Arena.

22:45.202 --> 22:46.870
It's a small gesture
the house of Whele makes

22:46.904 --> 22:49.639
to inspire and entertain the city.

22:49.674 --> 22:52.776
- Good night, Arika.
- Good night.

22:56.514 --> 22:59.749
I wonder if the brides she
was offering would be spies.

22:59.784 --> 23:04.387
Possible. We have so much that they don't.

23:04.422 --> 23:06.756
Helena has the only
air force in the cradle,

23:06.791 --> 23:08.191
a fleet of aircraft

23:08.225 --> 23:12.162
they inherited from hill air force base.

23:12.196 --> 23:14.898
The cripple Riesen won't
be an obstacle much longer.

23:14.932 --> 23:17.100
Once we have consolidated our position

23:17.134 --> 23:19.736
and you've been made lord of the city,

23:19.770 --> 23:23.239
we'll want her as an ally.

23:59.343 --> 24:01.478
Jeep.

24:07.284 --> 24:10.120
I see you still like the highest perch.

24:10.154 --> 24:12.389
It's been 15 years.

24:12.423 --> 24:15.792
- I thought you were dead.
- Hmm.

24:15.826 --> 24:18.628
14 1/2, but who's counting?

24:18.662 --> 24:22.298
- What does everyone else think?
- The same.

24:22.333 --> 24:24.601
David Whele built you a statue in memoriam.

24:24.635 --> 24:28.071
That's creepy.

24:28.105 --> 24:30.273
It's not a good likeness.

24:30.307 --> 24:31.641
It looks more like Whele than you.

24:31.675 --> 24:36.112
He hasn't changed.

24:36.147 --> 24:38.948
We all assumed the tattoos were lost to us.

24:40.384 --> 24:41.751
No.

24:41.786 --> 24:45.321
Have you deciphered any of them?

24:45.356 --> 24:47.123
It isn't just a language to decipher.

24:47.158 --> 24:49.492
It's something else.

24:49.527 --> 24:50.860
And from what I could find,

24:50.895 --> 24:53.296
there's no historical equivalent.

24:53.330 --> 24:56.132
Much of the last 14 years was
spent on wild goose chases,

24:56.167 --> 24:58.168
looking for the names of
prophets I'd misspelled

24:58.202 --> 25:03.339
or tasks I thought I was
commanded to carry out.

25:03.374 --> 25:06.743
Unfortunately, the
tattoos are indecipherable.

25:12.249 --> 25:16.820
How is he?

25:16.854 --> 25:20.156
What's he like?

25:20.191 --> 25:24.394
Undisciplined, strong-willed,

25:24.428 --> 25:29.632
passionate, mercurial.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.868
Good.

25:31.902 --> 25:34.871
- Can you bring him to me?
- Yes.

25:38.509 --> 25:43.313
Everything's about to change.

25:43.347 --> 25:45.615
War's coming.

25:57.795 --> 25:59.562
People have lived inside these walls

25:59.597 --> 26:02.232
so long they've forgotten
they're not prisoners.

26:05.703 --> 26:07.770
Father, there's something
that I need to tell...

26:07.805 --> 26:11.608
I'm stepping down from ruling Vega.

26:11.642 --> 26:12.909
The city's strong enough

26:12.943 --> 26:14.410
to give power back to the people.

26:14.445 --> 26:16.746
Let them make their own way going forward.

26:16.780 --> 26:20.083
The people are not ready.

26:20.117 --> 26:22.285
Vega is not ready.

26:22.319 --> 26:25.054
And Senator Whele will never
give up power that easily.

26:25.089 --> 26:27.524
He won't allow the people
to govern themselves.

26:27.558 --> 26:30.226
Father, if you step down
in the name of democracy,

26:30.261 --> 26:33.263
he will turn this city into a dictatorship.

26:39.637 --> 26:42.772
And what do you think it is now?

26:42.806 --> 26:46.242
You're a good man.

26:46.277 --> 26:49.045
Am I?

26:49.079 --> 26:51.981
Why now?

26:52.016 --> 26:54.784
We have worked so hard to build this city

26:54.818 --> 26:57.587
into what it is.

26:57.621 --> 26:59.822
You can't just give up.

26:59.857 --> 27:03.393
I'm not giving up. I'm moving forward.

27:03.427 --> 27:05.261
So should you.

27:05.296 --> 27:07.463
You have the strength of character

27:07.498 --> 27:10.934
that Vega desperately needs, Claire.

27:10.968 --> 27:12.569
You'll be important to its survival,

27:12.603 --> 27:16.839
and soon, you'll be
called on to protect it.

27:18.809 --> 27:23.213
So what was it you wished to tell me?

27:24.782 --> 27:28.651
Nothing. It was nothing.

27:59.250 --> 28:01.651
You're as paranoid as ever.

28:01.685 --> 28:04.721
If that were true, you'd be dead.

28:07.258 --> 28:09.359
Tell me about the boy.

28:09.393 --> 28:12.362
I've never seen any of
your children before.

28:12.396 --> 28:16.132
Why bring him here?

28:16.166 --> 28:19.302
Roan isn't one of our children.

28:19.336 --> 28:20.970
He's favored by Evelyn.

28:21.005 --> 28:24.073
She dotes on him like an adopted son.

28:24.108 --> 28:26.676
Oh.

28:26.710 --> 28:29.646
Why?

28:29.680 --> 28:31.914
He's a savant.

28:31.949 --> 28:36.152
Knows 20 languages, can
play a Bach piano concerto,

28:36.186 --> 28:38.087
recites Shakespeare.

28:38.122 --> 28:41.858
His knowledge of history is astonishing.

28:41.892 --> 28:45.495
He's amazing, teaching us many things,

28:45.529 --> 28:47.764
but he's painfully shy

28:47.798 --> 28:53.336
and needs to be treated gently.

28:53.370 --> 28:55.571
Roan wanted to see the great city of Vega,

28:55.606 --> 28:58.207
and Evelyn denies him nothing.

28:58.242 --> 29:02.011
She believes he's special,

29:02.046 --> 29:04.347
very special.

29:04.381 --> 29:06.215
And you?

29:09.987 --> 29:12.588
I've never seen a child quite like him.

29:15.759 --> 29:19.862
A boy with those gifts
could be useful to Vega.

29:21.632 --> 29:23.800
He's not for sale.

29:23.834 --> 29:27.136
Everything has a price.

30:10.114 --> 30:11.647
She wants to see you upstairs.

30:11.682 --> 30:13.249
Needs some stuff from the supply center

30:13.283 --> 30:16.185
for tonight.

30:18.822 --> 30:20.256
Yes, ma'am.

30:20.290 --> 30:21.858
I need these filled by early afternoon.

30:21.892 --> 30:23.192
- Yes, ma'am.
- Listen.

30:23.227 --> 30:24.827
Something is happening with my father

30:24.862 --> 30:26.496
that could change everything.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.831
I couldn't bring it up to him.

30:28.866 --> 30:32.001
So tonight after the Jubilee,

30:32.035 --> 30:34.704
we leave as planned.

30:34.738 --> 30:36.906
That'll be all. Thank you.

30:44.248 --> 30:45.748
Come with me.

31:13.710 --> 31:17.547
Okay, okay, okay.

31:17.581 --> 31:19.582
You've trained him well, Michael.

31:27.991 --> 31:29.792
Dad?

31:35.532 --> 31:37.233
How did you get here?

31:37.267 --> 31:42.071
I came back last night to see you, to talk.

31:42.105 --> 31:45.575
I'm not interested in
anything you have to say.

31:45.609 --> 31:47.844
You gave me up.

31:47.878 --> 31:50.746
A scribbled note left in
the night made that clear.

31:50.781 --> 31:54.550
Do you remember what it said? I do.

31:54.585 --> 31:55.852
"You'll be an orphan now, Alex."

31:55.886 --> 31:57.620
I didn't think I'd make it back.

31:57.654 --> 32:00.022
I was 11. You left me alone.

32:00.057 --> 32:01.257
You had Michael.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.828
He isn't even human.

32:05.863 --> 32:08.731
Human enough to side
with us against his own.

32:08.765 --> 32:10.967
The only one to fight for us.

32:11.001 --> 32:13.069
Without Michael, we would've lost the war.

32:13.103 --> 32:16.239
Alex! Nothing's been done
that wasn't necessary.

32:16.273 --> 32:20.109
"Necessary"?

32:20.143 --> 32:21.944
Do you realize by making me an orphan,

32:21.979 --> 32:24.947
you put me in the lowest caste?

32:24.982 --> 32:26.249
A 1.

32:26.283 --> 32:28.117
If I hadn't become a soldier,

32:28.151 --> 32:30.686
I wouldn't have had anywhere
to sleep or anything to eat.

32:30.721 --> 32:32.989
You basically left me to die.

32:33.023 --> 32:34.857
It isn't the life I
would have chosen for you.

32:34.892 --> 32:38.027
None of it is.

32:38.061 --> 32:41.163
You. You knew this all along.

32:41.198 --> 32:44.433
Alex.

32:44.468 --> 32:48.437
You go back to whatever
hole you crawled out of.

32:48.472 --> 32:51.908
You don't have a son.

32:56.647 --> 33:00.216
We need to bring the council together today

33:00.250 --> 33:02.385
before the Jubilee.

33:05.889 --> 33:10.593
Did I do the right thing for Alex?

33:12.062 --> 33:15.698
That remains to be seen.

33:15.732 --> 33:20.436
They found this at the altar.

33:23.206 --> 33:25.007
I don't understand.

33:25.042 --> 33:28.144
The angels took everything from us,

33:28.178 --> 33:31.213
and there are idiots
who still worship them.

33:31.248 --> 33:33.883
I know, but the acolytes are still

33:33.917 --> 33:35.251
a small and secretive group.

33:35.285 --> 33:37.720
- They can't hide forever.
- Good.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.256
My followers will find them.

33:40.290 --> 33:42.692
Keep them searching.

33:45.462 --> 33:47.730
Come on inside.

34:14.157 --> 34:16.692
He was caught outside the
city walls this morning,

34:16.726 --> 34:19.562
trying to find a way inside.

34:19.596 --> 34:21.931
You... you brought one into the city?

34:21.965 --> 34:26.534
People need to be reminded
of what we're up against

34:26.570 --> 34:29.672
and who's protected them all this time.

34:39.726 --> 34:42.494
You're sharpening that like
you're gonna kill somebody.

34:42.529 --> 34:44.563
Yeah, you. You're late.

34:44.598 --> 34:45.831
I was working in the laundry,

34:45.866 --> 34:48.734
and they wouldn't let me go.

34:48.768 --> 34:51.070
I'm sorry. I had a bad day.

34:51.103 --> 34:52.871
You want to talk about it?

34:52.906 --> 34:55.174
It's in the past.

34:55.208 --> 34:57.810
Bixby, gonna meet me at
south entrance of the arena.

34:57.844 --> 35:01.247
Access is restricted to V-2 and above.

35:01.281 --> 35:03.349
- Can you get in?
- Yeah.

35:03.383 --> 35:05.351
10:00 P.M. tonight.

35:05.385 --> 35:07.486
Do you understand? You can't be late.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.488
- What's going on?
- You'll see.

35:09.522 --> 35:11.257
And, Bixby, you can't tell anyone.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.559
You got it?

35:21.701 --> 35:24.937
She's more of a man than you.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.641
What's Michael being so cryptic about?

35:40.053 --> 35:43.455
Yeah, I'm alive.

35:46.293 --> 35:48.093
How?

35:48.128 --> 35:51.263
Thick-headedness.

35:51.298 --> 35:53.599
I haven't been able to
decipher anything of substance

35:53.633 --> 35:56.635
from the tattoos.

35:56.670 --> 36:00.272
- Can Michael?
- No.

36:00.307 --> 36:03.709
But more importantly, I found Gabriel.

36:03.743 --> 36:04.944
What?

36:04.978 --> 36:06.312
I guess it was wishful thinking

36:06.346 --> 36:08.847
that he might have died in the bombings.

36:14.087 --> 36:15.988
He built a fortress and
an army of the possessed

36:16.022 --> 36:18.390
in the mountains outside of Boulder.

36:18.425 --> 36:21.026
They seem to have adapted.

36:21.061 --> 36:25.431
Gabriel is massing for another war.

36:27.334 --> 36:29.601
It gets worse.

36:29.636 --> 36:31.737
A few of the higher
angels have joined Gabriel,

36:31.771 --> 36:33.305
and they can appear perfectly human.

36:33.340 --> 36:37.343
In the same way as Michael and Gabriel?

36:37.377 --> 36:39.845
Yes.

36:39.879 --> 36:42.748
They belong to the second sphere of angels,

36:42.782 --> 36:45.918
the powers.

36:45.952 --> 36:47.152
They were born to be warriors

36:47.187 --> 36:48.487
to keep the other angels in line,

36:48.521 --> 36:50.622
and like Gabriel,

36:50.657 --> 36:53.292
some of them have always hated man.

36:53.326 --> 36:54.793
The powers are far more dangerous

36:54.828 --> 36:56.428
than the angels that possessed mankind

36:56.463 --> 36:58.430
during the extermination.

36:58.465 --> 37:00.933
I had hoped they would sit out this war.

37:00.967 --> 37:05.504
Gabriel's obviously persuaded
some of them to join him.

37:05.538 --> 37:08.007
His name is Furiad.

37:08.041 --> 37:09.875
We should cancel the Jubilee.

37:09.909 --> 37:14.046
- Alert the city.
- Agreed.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.647
All of this has convinced me

37:15.682 --> 37:17.716
it's time to reveal the chosen one.

37:17.751 --> 37:20.452
- You know who it is?
- Yeah.

37:20.487 --> 37:21.687
Who?

37:21.721 --> 37:23.655
We will tell you soon enough.

37:23.690 --> 37:27.493
I don't have time for this.

37:27.527 --> 37:30.662
There's no chosen one,
no one coming to save us.

37:30.697 --> 37:32.364
Never was.

37:32.399 --> 37:37.069
We're the chosen ones,
not some imaginary savior.

37:37.103 --> 37:39.872
That isn't true.

37:39.906 --> 37:41.907
The savior's real.

37:41.941 --> 37:43.208
The baby lived.

37:43.243 --> 37:45.511
That's your delusion, not mine.

37:45.545 --> 37:47.146
So the baby lived.

37:47.180 --> 37:50.315
Many babies lived. We lived.

37:50.350 --> 37:52.851
Hear them out, David.

37:52.886 --> 37:54.820
Michael has never misled us.

37:54.854 --> 37:57.656
Michael may not be a
mystery to you, Madam Consul,

37:57.690 --> 38:00.559
but he is to me.

38:00.593 --> 38:03.595
What were you planning on doing?

38:03.630 --> 38:06.832
Find some random child,
and tell us he's the baby?

38:06.866 --> 38:08.500
What proof do we have?

38:08.535 --> 38:10.903
How do we measure him, on your word alone?

38:10.937 --> 38:12.404
You have faith.

38:14.941 --> 38:17.609
Oh, that died a long time ago, Archangel,

38:17.644 --> 38:22.748
when your kind laid waste to my planet.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.451
And "War Is Coming"?

38:25.485 --> 38:26.919
Not news to me.

38:26.953 --> 38:29.588
It never ended.

38:29.622 --> 38:32.558
We are the angels' natural enemy.

38:32.592 --> 38:37.062
It won't be over until
they're extinct or we are.

38:37.097 --> 38:40.532
And what we have to do is prepare everyone

38:40.567 --> 38:42.734
for that inevitability.

38:42.769 --> 38:45.137
Lead them!

38:45.171 --> 38:50.275
And we lead them by attending the Jubilee.

38:52.979 --> 38:57.249
People need a release from
the stress of this city,

38:57.283 --> 38:58.484
but more important,

38:58.518 --> 39:00.652
they need something to inspire them.

39:00.687 --> 39:02.454
So, General, tonight has to go forward.

39:02.489 --> 39:04.957
We cannot cancel.

39:04.991 --> 39:06.458
After that, I mean,

39:06.493 --> 39:08.894
I'll be the first to reconvene here,

39:08.928 --> 39:10.129
roll my sleeves up,

39:10.163 --> 39:15.267
and do whatever it takes to keep us safe.

39:15.301 --> 39:20.572
But don't ask me to put
my faith in some child god.

39:20.607 --> 39:23.275
A savior.

39:23.309 --> 39:26.712
I'll never do it again.

39:58.478 --> 40:01.647
- How could you allow it?
- Allow what?

40:01.681 --> 40:05.317
- Allow him to have you.
- It's work, nothing more.

40:05.351 --> 40:09.087
Evelyn won't see it that way.

40:40.787 --> 40:43.322
I've got nothing to say to you.

40:43.356 --> 40:44.890
Then I'll do the talking.

41:03.977 --> 41:05.577
I never knew there were any pictures

41:05.612 --> 41:07.112
of my mother.

41:07.146 --> 41:08.680
This is the only one.

41:08.715 --> 41:14.019
It's been my good luck
charm all these years.

41:14.053 --> 41:16.088
Now it's yours.

41:29.769 --> 41:32.371
Welcome, Vega!

41:38.778 --> 41:44.249
Tonight we celebrate our
resilience, our fortitude,

41:44.284 --> 41:46.318
and our collective courage!

41:50.323 --> 41:53.392
Every year we use this, our Jubilee,

41:53.426 --> 41:56.094
to be reminded of the past,

41:56.129 --> 41:59.631
but also to look forward,

41:59.666 --> 42:02.134
and it is in that spirit of looking forward

42:02.168 --> 42:04.336
that I have an announcement to make

42:04.370 --> 42:07.339
of incredible importance
to this, our beloved city,

42:07.373 --> 42:08.974
to Vega!

42:13.813 --> 42:18.850
Tonight... tonight our
city will become stronger.

42:18.885 --> 42:21.620
It will become unified,

42:21.654 --> 42:24.990
because tonight it is my great pleasure

42:25.024 --> 42:28.126
to announce the engagement
of Claire Riesen...

42:30.129 --> 42:32.097
to William Whele.

42:36.803 --> 42:40.072
Come on, son. Come and take a bow.

42:42.709 --> 42:44.109
Come.

42:44.143 --> 42:46.878
Come on, Claire. Stand up.

42:51.884 --> 42:53.352
Through their marriage,

42:53.386 --> 42:56.188
we will join Vega's two greatest houses,

42:56.222 --> 43:00.225
the house of Riesen and Whele,

43:00.259 --> 43:03.562
thus securing the safety and future

43:03.596 --> 43:05.564
of this wondrous city.

43:14.574 --> 43:19.211
Now, as is our custom,

43:19.245 --> 43:20.812
at the Jubilee,

43:20.847 --> 43:24.383
we celebrate the soldiers
who stand on our walls,

43:24.417 --> 43:26.985
who protect us,

43:27.019 --> 43:30.689
keep us safe so that
we can enjoy this life,

43:30.723 --> 43:32.357
but tonight

43:32.392 --> 43:37.696
we have something extra special.

43:37.730 --> 43:42.267
Thomas Ford is one of
Vega's greatest champions,

43:42.301 --> 43:46.271
a legend for killing
22 eight balls in battle

43:46.305 --> 43:48.006
with nothing but his knife.

43:48.040 --> 43:49.241
Let's hear it for Thomas.

44:01.988 --> 44:05.457
Well, Thomas, it's time to meet the 23rd.

44:56.676 --> 44:58.844
Okay, settle down now.

44:58.878 --> 45:01.146
There's nothing to fear.
We are in complete control.

45:01.180 --> 45:03.849
You allowed him to bring one into the city?

45:03.883 --> 45:05.283
But it's good. It's always good...

45:05.318 --> 45:06.585
I had no idea.

45:06.619 --> 45:10.755
To be reminded of what we face,

45:10.790 --> 45:16.027
what is out there waiting for us,

45:16.062 --> 45:19.297
the thing that asks nothing but takes all.

45:22.735 --> 45:24.202
It must be destroyed.

45:36.315 --> 45:37.883
Gabriel.

45:53.099 --> 45:56.101
Oh, my...

46:04.944 --> 46:05.911
Let's go. Come on.

46:05.945 --> 46:07.412
Let's go!

46:56.993 --> 46:59.028
Warning, security breach.

46:59.062 --> 47:01.564
How did they get that
close without us knowing?

47:01.598 --> 47:02.731
Warning, security breach.

47:02.766 --> 47:06.368
Ah, hell. Fire!

47:18.448 --> 47:19.582
Code Red.

47:19.616 --> 47:23.586
A citywide attack is imminent.

47:23.620 --> 47:25.354
Get Claire and Riesen to bunker eight.

47:25.388 --> 47:27.022
Stay there until I come and get you.

47:27.057 --> 47:29.258
Go, go! Bunker eight!

47:29.292 --> 47:33.295
Code Red. A citywide attack is imminent.

47:35.665 --> 47:40.302
Bixby!

47:40.337 --> 47:42.238
Bixby!

47:42.272 --> 47:44.807
Bixby!

47:44.841 --> 47:48.777
Bixby!

47:51.081 --> 47:52.548
Bixby!

47:52.582 --> 47:55.050
Code Red, Code Red.

47:55.085 --> 47:56.051
Report to designated safe area.

47:56.086 --> 47:58.320
Get back! Get back!

48:10.233 --> 48:12.201
Let's go! Move, people, this way!

48:17.440 --> 48:19.675
Come on!

48:21.711 --> 48:23.846
Bixby!

48:27.384 --> 48:29.485
Bixby!

48:30.720 --> 48:33.689
- Come on, come on!
- Alex!

48:33.723 --> 48:36.859
Claire!

48:39.996 --> 48:41.864
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

48:41.898 --> 48:43.232
Listen, we don't have
enough time right now.

48:43.266 --> 48:46.669
We gotta get out of here.

48:46.703 --> 48:48.470
No, no, no, no, no!
Claire, Claire, this way.

48:48.505 --> 48:50.072
Go this way!

49:03.520 --> 49:05.354
- What am I looking at?
- Three angels, sir.

49:05.388 --> 49:07.323
They breached the city's defenses.

49:07.357 --> 49:08.857
We managed to destroy one of them,

49:08.892 --> 49:10.693
but two made it over the wall.

49:10.727 --> 49:14.163
- Where are they headed?
- The reactor, sir.

49:16.933 --> 49:19.902
Incoming!

49:27.944 --> 49:29.345
Fire! Fire!

49:49.661 --> 49:52.361
_

49:54.886 --> 49:56.986
_

49:58.111 --> 50:00.211
_

50:00.236 --> 50:02.436
_

50:41.651 --> 50:44.420
Let's go.

50:44.454 --> 50:46.488
Leave right now, tonight.

50:46.523 --> 50:48.457
Leave the city? It's under attack.

50:48.491 --> 50:50.959
- This is a Code Red.
- It's perfect.

50:50.994 --> 50:52.561
By the time they begin looking for us,

50:52.595 --> 50:57.633
we'll be half way to Delphi.

50:57.667 --> 50:59.835
I can't.

51:04.107 --> 51:05.441
Not right now.

51:05.475 --> 51:06.909
My father needs me, and Vega needs us.

51:06.943 --> 51:09.678
We have to stay and protect the city.

51:09.712 --> 51:11.113
We'll work this out.

51:11.147 --> 51:13.916
Nobody is gonna tell me who to marry, Alex.

51:13.950 --> 51:16.618
What makes you think you're
gonna have a choice, huh?

51:16.653 --> 51:18.153
If we go through that door, Claire,

51:18.188 --> 51:19.421
we're staying.

51:19.456 --> 51:20.989
We're never gonna leave.

51:21.024 --> 51:22.658
Alex, I promise.

51:22.692 --> 51:24.793
I promise I will make this right.

51:24.828 --> 51:26.929
Trust me.

51:26.963 --> 51:30.165
Please, don't leave me.

51:59.229 --> 52:02.064
Sir, what's...

52:44.440 --> 52:47.876
Sir, every camera in the city is dark.

52:50.380 --> 52:52.080
- What are you doing?
- Michael needs my help.

52:52.115 --> 52:53.949
- Michael can handle himself.
- Get out of my way.

52:53.983 --> 52:55.517
If this bunker's breached,

52:55.552 --> 52:57.519
all of Vega's leaders
are within these walls.

52:57.554 --> 52:59.688
Claire? She's your responsibility.

52:59.722 --> 53:03.926
- You're needed here.
- I'm needed out there more.

53:09.899 --> 53:13.802
You can't help him now. No one can.

54:00.229 --> 54:02.764
It won't take long to
restore power to Vega.

54:02.798 --> 54:05.367
We'll soon get our defenses back online.

54:05.401 --> 54:09.404
I have every confidence in you, David.

54:20.483 --> 54:23.418
I was so worried.

54:23.452 --> 54:26.988
Thank the savior you're all right.

54:27.023 --> 54:29.190
I am.

54:48.210 --> 54:49.311
Stop firing!

54:49.345 --> 54:51.646
Cease fire!

55:13.569 --> 55:16.638
I need a med kit!

55:22.178 --> 55:23.912
You're ready.

55:27.750 --> 55:30.585
I believe in you.

55:33.356 --> 55:39.361
You... you are the chosen one.

55:53.909 --> 55:57.345
The last words from a dying brain.

55:57.380 --> 55:59.714
The man was hallucinating.

55:59.749 --> 56:02.283
Ridiculous.

56:54.603 --> 56:57.238
Get up.

57:02.344 --> 57:03.912
Arrest her.

57:03.946 --> 57:05.980
You have to believe me,
David. We had no part in this.

57:06.015 --> 57:08.216
- And round up her entourage.
- I had no idea what Roan was.

57:08.250 --> 57:09.617
He was deceiving all of us.

57:09.652 --> 57:10.618
What would we have to gain?

57:10.653 --> 57:12.487
- Please think.
- I am.

57:12.521 --> 57:15.023
General, please, you must listen to me.

57:15.057 --> 57:17.592
Go! Go!

57:17.626 --> 57:20.228
I don't want her hurt.

57:20.262 --> 57:21.896
Arresting Arika could spark another war.

57:21.931 --> 57:24.499
We're already at war.

57:24.533 --> 57:26.067
They brought that thing into the city,

57:26.102 --> 57:27.635
and it killed Jeep.

57:27.670 --> 57:29.738
And you unleashed that
monstrosity at the Jubilee.

57:29.772 --> 57:32.140
How is this any different?
You knew what you were doing.

57:32.174 --> 57:33.808
It's not sure that she did.

57:33.843 --> 57:37.979
Vega has become unfocused, and so have you.

57:38.013 --> 57:42.517
My little demonstration
couldn't have worked any better.

57:42.551 --> 57:47.122
Now we'll all be ready for
the battle that's coming.

57:47.156 --> 57:51.192
So, Alex Lannon,

57:51.227 --> 57:53.695
show us your arms.

58:09.845 --> 58:13.114
Who's that?

58:13.149 --> 58:15.617
Bixby.

58:15.651 --> 58:17.485
- Designation?
- V-1.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.654
V-1... What... what is she doing here?

58:19.688 --> 58:22.157
She's with me.

58:22.191 --> 58:25.827
She's under my protection.

58:25.861 --> 58:30.632
The protection of House Riesen.

58:30.666 --> 58:33.201
Well, she better be able to keep a secret,

58:33.235 --> 58:36.971
because no one here is
gonna breathe a word of this

58:37.006 --> 58:39.474
to anyone until we've
figured out what it all means.

58:39.508 --> 58:41.176
- Is that understood?
- She'll be quiet.

58:41.210 --> 58:43.745
I promise.

58:52.421 --> 58:56.391
I'm fine.

58:56.425 --> 58:58.026
What happened?

58:58.060 --> 59:01.896
The reactor was damaged,
but containment held...

59:04.033 --> 59:05.266
for now.

59:18.647 --> 59:23.218
The boy was an angel,
another member of the powers.

59:23.252 --> 59:25.420
That's why he was able to
pass through our scanners.

59:25.454 --> 59:28.389
Jeep was right.

59:28.424 --> 59:30.692
More than one higher
angel has joined Gabriel

59:30.726 --> 59:32.927
in his war against us.

59:38.834 --> 59:40.201
Cover up.

59:40.236 --> 59:43.872
Make sure none of the tattoos show.

59:43.906 --> 59:47.308
Alex is the baby I saved
all those years ago.

59:49.478 --> 59:52.647
He's under my protection.

01:00:03.038 --> 01:00:06.741
I don't believe this Alex
Lannon is the chosen one

01:00:06.775 --> 01:00:08.543
or even that the baby was ever real.

01:00:08.577 --> 01:00:10.878
You saw the tattoos. You saw what happened.

01:00:10.913 --> 01:00:15.550
I saw the tattoos
transfer from Jeep to Alex,

01:00:15.584 --> 01:00:17.418
but I've seen more
extraordinary things happen

01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:19.220
since this insanity began.

01:00:19.254 --> 01:00:22.423
The tattoos are a
harbinger of what's to come.

01:00:22.457 --> 01:00:24.659
They will usher in a period of hope.

01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:28.396
Save it for your flock, William.

01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:29.730
Religious theater is one thing.

01:00:29.765 --> 01:00:31.332
This is politics.

01:00:31.366 --> 01:00:34.802
My faith is not a theater,
nor is it a delusion.

01:00:34.836 --> 01:00:37.438
I don't know what it all means,

01:00:37.472 --> 01:00:39.774
but I'm not bowing to anyone,

01:00:39.808 --> 01:00:42.577
and you aren't either.

01:00:42.611 --> 01:00:45.980
Alex Lannon is now our greatest threat,

01:00:46.014 --> 01:00:47.982
and Claire Riesen is in love with him,

01:00:48.016 --> 01:00:49.917
which makes your union that much harder.

01:00:49.952 --> 01:00:53.921
What? You're wrong.

01:00:53.956 --> 01:00:55.823
Oh, William, come on.

01:00:55.857 --> 01:00:57.592
I'm sorry, but your feelings for Claire

01:00:57.626 --> 01:00:59.126
have obviously blinded you

01:00:59.161 --> 01:01:01.829
to what was plain to see in that room,

01:01:01.863 --> 01:01:03.698
which makes it more imperative than ever

01:01:03.732 --> 01:01:07.802
that we take full control of Vega.

01:01:07.836 --> 01:01:11.172
Evelyn isn't gonna like
us holding Arika in prison.

01:01:11.206 --> 01:01:12.840
Riesen thought she was innocent.

01:01:12.874 --> 01:01:15.176
She seemed to be speaking
the truth when she said

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:17.044
she had no idea what Roan was.

01:01:17.079 --> 01:01:18.980
I don't care.

01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:20.514
That city is full of assassins.

01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:22.116
How do you think Evelyn came to power?

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:24.552
You know Arika is Evelyn's wife, don't you?

01:01:24.586 --> 01:01:28.222
Don't agree with Riesen about anything

01:01:28.257 --> 01:01:32.260
ever again.

01:02:07.262 --> 01:02:11.265
You were never alone.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.367
What?

01:02:13.402 --> 01:02:16.437
When Jeep left, you were never alone.

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:19.006
I watched over you.

01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:22.109
I made sure you joined the army.

01:02:22.144 --> 01:02:23.377
I formed the Archangel Corps

01:02:23.412 --> 01:02:24.612
so that I could stay close to you

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:26.414
without arousing suspicion.

01:02:26.448 --> 01:02:29.050
Everything was done so
you could train in secret.

01:02:29.084 --> 01:02:31.619
No one could know who you were.

01:02:31.653 --> 01:02:35.790
Am I supposed to thank you...

01:02:35.824 --> 01:02:38.793
thank Jeep... for all of this?

01:02:38.827 --> 01:02:42.463
No, it just is.

01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:45.433
As your father, Jeep held
the tattoos on his body

01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:47.301
for when you were ready.

01:02:47.336 --> 01:02:49.570
He knew it might mean his death.

01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:52.239
I'm not ready.

01:02:52.274 --> 01:02:55.209
- I'm no savior.
- You are.

01:02:55.243 --> 01:02:58.079
It's up to you to decipher the tattoos.

01:02:58.113 --> 01:03:00.147
I bore them on my body
before they were transferred

01:03:00.182 --> 01:03:02.416
onto Jeep's,

01:03:02.451 --> 01:03:04.885
but they were always
meant for the chosen one.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.955
First the tattoos were on
you. Then they were on Jeep.

01:03:07.989 --> 01:03:09.590
Then they're on me.

01:03:09.624 --> 01:03:11.992
How do I know they're not
meant for someone else?

01:03:17.299 --> 01:03:18.499
What are they?

01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:21.469
Our fate...

01:03:21.503 --> 01:03:24.572
Our hope...

01:03:24.606 --> 01:03:29.009
written in a language long since forgotten,

01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:30.344
one even I don't know.

01:03:31.947 --> 01:03:34.515
Can you show them to me?

01:03:37.052 --> 01:03:41.155
Can you read them?

01:03:41.189 --> 01:03:46.694
- I can't.
- You must.

01:03:46.728 --> 01:03:50.498
This is war, and only one side can win.

01:03:50.532 --> 01:03:52.433
What's in those tattoos will guide you

01:03:52.467 --> 01:03:54.435
through what's to come.

01:03:54.469 --> 01:03:55.703
They will lay out the path

01:03:55.737 --> 01:03:57.505
through which mankind can be redeemed

01:03:57.539 --> 01:04:00.107
and Gabriel and his legions pushed back,

01:04:00.142 --> 01:04:03.210
but this path will not be easily traversed.

01:04:03.245 --> 01:04:05.146
At every step,

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:10.017
you must choose which course to take.

01:04:12.754 --> 01:04:14.555
I believe you are the only one

01:04:14.589 --> 01:04:19.860
that can end this war.

01:04:19.895 --> 01:04:23.864
I'm just a man, Michael.

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:30.237
How can you be sure?

01:04:30.272 --> 01:04:33.874
Nothing is ever certain,

01:04:33.909 --> 01:04:36.877
but Jeep had hope, Alex.

01:04:36.912 --> 01:04:40.548
He had faith in you,

01:04:40.582 --> 01:04:42.416
and so do I.

01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:46.187
Try.

01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:49.557
Can you discern anything?

01:05:05.106 --> 01:05:08.309
No.

01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:46.480
My son,

01:05:46.515 --> 01:05:48.315
William.

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:50.450
We found him.
