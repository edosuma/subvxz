Two of you are about to join
the exclusive ranks

40:17.909 --> 40:20.292

Bottle service on me!

I know you're hurting
right now, Ambs,

40:48.302 --> 40:50.124
but I think the best way to get
over the pain of rejection

40:50.224 --> 40:52.006
is to rebound
as fast as possible.

wait a second.

Hey, if you're only taking
one person from my team,

40:57.992 --> 40:59.254
it should be Zoey.

even bother showing up

41:00.755 --> 41:02.217
for the last round.

because she's at the hospital

41:03.678 --> 41:05.420
with her mom,

41:05.520 --> 41:07.222

than me,

41:07.322 --> 41:09.625
she wants it more than me,

do great things here.

41:24.141 --> 41:26.523

could stand to have

41:26.623 --> 41:28.565
one female coder.

All right, Tony, put the
glitter back in the cannon.
