00:14.160 --> 00:18.631
We have waited patiently for you to renounce
this unholy pact with our oppressors,

00:18.720 --> 00:22.110
We have heard nothing.
This is the cost of that silence.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.950
Choose to sign this corrupt document,

00:26.040 --> 00:30.192
understand that you will be staining it
with the blood of the remaining hostages.

00:30.280 --> 00:34.034
If CTU can't pull this off in time,
that's upwards of 60 people, Mike.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.355
If someone altered the recording of your call
with Palmer, the president needs to know.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.831
With the summit and the hostage situation,
he's not in the frame of mind to deal with this.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.708
Till the treaty is signed,
I'm not letting this out of my sight.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.839
- What did she tell you?
- It was a transcript of her call with Palmer.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.834
President Logan wants us
to go in the terminal.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.799
Yes, before the treaty is signed.
Curtis, what's your situation?

01:05.880 --> 01:09.589
We're in place and setting the entry charges.
We should enter on target.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.717
- I assume Bauer's in custody.
- I'll debrief him here, but...

01:12.800 --> 01:14.392
Bring him in, now.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.837
- Diane, what's wrong?
- Derek is inside the terminal.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.356
I see him. He's with the other hostages,
but he's not hurt.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.557
- Don't let anything happen to him.
- This is not your fault.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.916
- I'm the reason you went along with him.
- This is not over.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.188
Fire!

01:35.080 --> 01:39.198
We've got a problem. One hostage is missing.
He was working with the terrorists.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.714
- Give me a description.
- I'll help you. Let's go.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.234
Buchanan ordered to take you into custody.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.550
<i>Beresch gave this guy a key card,</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:50.679
<i>Something else is going down here,
We've got to find this guy now,</i>

02:46.440 --> 02:49.079
Sorry we have to bring
you in like this, Jack.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.151
It's all right, Mara. I understand.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.995
A year and a half. How'd you manage
to stay invisible for so long?

02:56.080 --> 02:59.072
Apparently I wasn't as invisible
as I should have been.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.148
- Tyler.
- Mara, it's Curtis, Put Bauer on,

03:04.240 --> 03:07.391
- It's Agent Manning.
- Yeah.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.994
The suspect was hiding among the hostages?

03:10.080 --> 03:12.833
Yeah, until the assault
began, around 10:30.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.037
- Then he must have broken for an exit.
- What exit was closest?

03:16.120 --> 03:18.873
Without an alarm,
between gates six and seven.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.791
- Thanks, Jack.
- Yeah.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.556
Pull up external videos starting at 10:30.
All cameras covering gates six and seven.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.876
Hang on, guys.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.951
I'll log you out.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.875
You're good to go.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.595
We're away.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.190
Mrs Logan.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.037
Mrs Logan.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.795
Oh, my God. Help, someone!

04:12.880 --> 04:16.555
Something's happened to the first lady.
Get a doctor now.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.435
He should be between gates six and seven,
just outside this vehicle.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.988
I got this feed from ten minutes ago.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.633
Try camera seven.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.790
Camera four.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.438
Tighten up.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.593
Yellow tie. Got him.
All right, let's follow him.

04:49.160 --> 04:53.551
- What camera covers the adjacent sector?
- 14A, but it's a bad angle.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.837
Pull it up anyway. Match the timecodes.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.436
OK, got him.
This is two minutes, 25 seconds later.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.035
- What hangar is that?
- Hangar BB.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.908
- Has it been searched yet?
- No. It was outside the secured perimeter.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.753
I'm taking a team over there.
Send this info to Comm.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.308
Team A with me. Let's move!

05:17.160 --> 05:19.628
Hangar BB. Let's go!

05:23.400 --> 05:24.469
CTU. Stiles.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.753
Jack told us about a suspect
hiding among the hostages.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.038
We just picked up surveillance on him.
He entered hangar BB at roughly 10:57.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.112
- Did you check it out yet?
- We're going in now. I need comm.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.034
- On it. What volume is airport facilities on?
- Hennessey four.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.314
Team two, cover the rear.

06:27.360 --> 06:33.310
Check it out. Everyone else,
search the building. See what you can find.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.475
It's clear.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.636
Craig, it's Curtis.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.919
Send a forensic team down here now. They'll
need a full biopack with spectrum analysers.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.275
- Any problems getting the canisters out?
- No. They were exactly where you said.

07:28.360 --> 07:31.750
- Transport on schedule?
- Customs documents are being finalised.

07:31.840 --> 07:36.072
Good. The Russians will learn the
consequences of occupying our homeland

07:36.160 --> 07:39.357
when we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.073
- When did this happen?
- A few minutes ago.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.994
- I came back in and I found her on the bed.
- What do you mean, "came back in"?

07:54.080 --> 07:56.310
You mean you left her alone.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.149
- What happened, Doctor? Is she all right?
- I'll do tests to find out why she blacked out.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.595
I didn't black out. Someone did this to me.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.797
- Someone attacked me, Charles.
- Shh, shh, shh. Marty.

08:11.880 --> 08:15.589
You have to do something.
They're trying to get me.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.069
No one's trying to get you.
We want you to be well.

08:18.160 --> 08:24.315
- Listen, I had the proof, and now it's gone.
- What proof are you talking about?

08:24.400 --> 08:28.473
Proof that David Palmer called me
to warn me about today.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.632
Are you still on this?

08:33.720 --> 08:37.508
We've never been off of it.
You just wouldn't listen to me.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.990
Sir, is everything OK?

08:41.080 --> 08:45.278
- I think so.
- No! No, dammit, it's not OK.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.280
You people have got to listen to me.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.557
I had a document from the archive room.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.030
- Where was this document?
- I am trying to tell you.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.557
It was hidden in my blouse.
It's gone. Someone stole it from me.

09:05.240 --> 09:09.916
Marty, you've been under a lot of stress,
we all have. Let... No, let Dr Hill...

09:10.000 --> 09:14.915
Let Dr Hill examine you, and we can
figure out how to get you better.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.676
You don't believe me.
You don't believe your own wife.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.949
I have a phone call from the
secretary of state I have to get to.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.396
If there's any changes,
get back to me as soon as possible.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.471
Yes, Mr President.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.834
- Don't leave.
- I'll be right down the hall.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.832
- No, honey. Don't leave me.
- You need to get some rest.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.148
Please.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.755
Close that door.

10:09.320 --> 10:13.871
- What do I do about this, Walt?
- This is what she was like before Vermont.

10:13.960 --> 10:19.956
- Are you suggesting that I readmit her?
- Consider the option, for her sake.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.989
She said she'd rather die
than go back in there.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.709
Sir, if she's gonna persist
with these conspiracy theories,

10:28.800 --> 10:32.554
it's only a matter of time before
she talks to someone who believes her.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.518
Then we really will have a problem.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.636
I wish you were wrong,
but I don't think so.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.838
Do you want me to handle this, sir?

10:53.960 --> 10:59.193
Make the arrangements.
But... don't let Martha find out.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.794
Let me be the one to tell her.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.871
Yes, sir.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.389
- Yeah?
- Have you handled the problem there?

11:15.480 --> 11:18.313
Yes. Martha Logan
won't be giving us any more trouble.

11:18.800 --> 11:24.397
Good. Erwich has completed transferring the
gas to the semi. He's on his way to the port.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.358
- The authorities don't know it's been stolen?
- Not yet.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.715
The only thing left to
take care of is Bauer.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.355
<i>- Where is he?
- On his way to CTU,</i>

11:32.440 --> 11:35.955
He's getting too close.
He's started putting the pieces together.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.430
I know. He needs to be taken out.
I'm handling it myself.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.638
How? Once he gets to CTU,
your hitter won't be able to get near him.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.870
I have someone on the inside
who can help us.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.757
<i>Then use him.</i>

11:47.840 --> 11:49.637
Done.

12:15.280 --> 12:19.432
<i>- You sure those readings are right?
- They're right. 2,000 parts per million.</i>

12:19.520 --> 12:22.353
- Could only be military grade.
- I'll tell 'em.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.468
- I need you to finish the shell script.
- Not now.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.118
Since when do you say "not now"?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.555
The hangar was leased
to an offshore company,

12:30.640 --> 12:32.995
but it's been vacant
for at least 18 months.

12:33.080 --> 12:38.837
Sir. I just heard from Curtis. He was right.
There was nerve gas in hangar BB.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.071
- It killed the rats.
- There were traces in their blood.

12:42.160 --> 12:45.550
But the concentrations
were definitely mil-spec. Weaponised.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.349
So the suspect Bauer told us about,
that's why he was at the airport?

12:49.440 --> 12:51.635
To steal canisters of nerve gas?

12:51.720 --> 12:55.315
Stealing from whom? The military
destroyed its stockpiles years ago.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.631
Maybe this nerve gas
wasn't produced by the military.

13:01.160 --> 13:05.358
Have Forensics get a signature off the trace.
See if they can tell who manufactured it.

13:05.440 --> 13:11.436
Chloe, elevate our alert status. Activate all
available personnel and get Curtis back here.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.275
Don't issue a statement
about the first lady yet.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.796
Let your successes today
run front and centre on all networks.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.677
That sounds right.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.589
Dr Hill, please, come in.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.796
- How's Martha doing?
- She's asleep.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.871
What caused the blackout?

13:28.960 --> 13:34.080
I spoke with her psychiatrist, and none
of her medication would have caused it.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.835
- So we still don't know what it was?
- Not yet, no.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.435
Mr President,
I need to speak to you and Walt alone.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.874
Thank you, Doctor. Keep a close eye on her.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.555
- We'll talk soon.
- Yes, Mr President.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.713
What's up?

13:51.800 --> 13:55.190
The situation at the airport
has taken an unexpected turn.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.478
What? The hostages were saved,
we've captured or killed the terrorists.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.870
Not all of them. One of the terrorists
was posing as a hostage.

14:02.960 --> 14:07.238
- He used the hostage crisis to cover a theft.
- A theft? What was stolen?

14:07.320 --> 14:10.118
A cache of chemical weapons.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.475
What kind of chemical weapons?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.073
Nerve gas.

14:18.360 --> 14:21.636
- Is it ours?
- No, sir. CTU is still trying to source it.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.598
But it was buried in a
bunker at the airport.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.717
It seems this man
had another crew waiting for him there.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.553
Do we have any idea
what the terrorists are planning?

14:30.640 --> 14:34.076
They haven't made any demands
or issued any threats yet.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.549
Well, what are we doing to stop them?

14:36.640 --> 14:42.954
CTU is running an interagency search effort.
They're coordinating ground operations.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.068
- Has the press found out about this yet?
- No, sir. It's being kept internal.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.358
Whatever retaliation
we were bracing for is nothing

14:55.440 --> 14:57.874
compared to what
these people are capable of now.

14:57.960 --> 15:03.876
Sir, I'll assemble the Homeland Security
team to discuss evacuation scenarios.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.595
I've sent everyone updates
on the airport forensics. What next?

15:18.680 --> 15:24.471
Check the task list. You don't need to ask me
every time you need something new to do.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.758
I don't care if you are my boss, or if
you regret sleeping with me last night.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.355
- No one talks to me like that.
- Really? I just did.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.474
Yeah.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.708
- What's your problem?
- I don't have a problem.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.951
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.837
Edgar.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.037
I'm sorry that my private life
hasn't remained private.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.680
- I'm thinking the opposite.
- What do you mean?

16:13.760 --> 16:18.914
You're too private. We've known each other
years. And I find out you're keeping secrets?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.673
People keep secrets.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.797
I don't. Not from my friends.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.110
Why didn't you tell me Jack was alive?

16:27.200 --> 16:29.873
Oh, come on. It's called
"national security".

16:29.960 --> 16:34.033
Yeah, well, what about Spenser?
I didn't even know you two were going out.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.998
Oh, give me a break.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.108
When we find the gas
and the alert level drops,

16:40.200 --> 16:45.558
we can have some camomile tea
and I'll tell you all my secrets, OK?

16:52.840 --> 16:55.593
- You paged me?
- Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

16:55.680 --> 16:58.797
- No, not yet.
- When he does, I need you to do something.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.838
We have our hands full
searching for the nerve gas.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.675
Bauer is a priority.
I need you to clear an entrance into CTU.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.148
I'm sending it now. OK.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.875
- Ms Raines?
- I'll get back to you. Yes?

17:12.960 --> 17:16.748
- I take it you're up to speed on the nerve gas?
- I was just filling in DOD.

17:16.839 --> 17:20.515
Diane Huxley was brought in to be
debriefed. I'd like you to interview her.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.953
Interview her about what?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.429
Anything that could help us
find the nerve gas.

17:24.520 --> 17:28.798
- What could she know about that?
- I've reviewed the evidence against Bauer,

17:28.880 --> 17:32.998
and I'm inclined to agree that he was
framed for the assassination of Palmer.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.355
- Thank you.
- I think whoever framed Jack

17:35.440 --> 17:37.715
is also involved with the nerve gas,

17:37.800 --> 17:41.190
which means Huxley
could have had contact with that person.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.272
Uh, I'm not a trained interrogator.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.114
But you know Jack Bauer,
better than anyone else in here.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.636
You have something in common with her.
It might help her open up.

17:51.720 --> 17:55.508
I realise it's awkward,
but I need you to do it.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.072
Fine.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.470
- I'll see what I can get from her.
- Thank you.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.511
- Where is she?
- She and her son just cleared security.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.432
- Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.
- Hi. This is my son Derek.

18:21.520 --> 18:26.355
Hi. I want you to be checked out
by a doctor while I speak with your mother.

18:26.440 --> 18:30.638
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- It's just procedure. Then we'll speak.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.678
Can you take him to Medical, please?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.669
It's OK. I'll see you in a bit.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.671
- Don't worry. He'll be fine.
- Is Jack gonna be here soon?

18:44.760 --> 18:47.433
He's on his way in. Come with me.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.912
I had no idea he worked
in a place like this.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.514
It's just up these stairs.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.354
- Did you know him before?
- Yes.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.670
I knew him.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.470
A lot of people here thought you were dead.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.949
Yeah, I know. Excuse me.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.233
Chloe.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.118
- Hi, Jack.
- Are you all right?

19:37.200 --> 19:38.792
Yeah, I'm OK.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.316
We wouldn't have made it
out of that airport without you. Thank you.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.836
- You're welcome.
- Mr Bauer. Lynn McGill from Division.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.549
I'll assume custody at
this point, thank you.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.474
You're no longer a suspect
in Palmer's murder, but you will need this.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.471
- Level two clearance.
- Thank you.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.391
Did Manning apprehend the suspect?

19:57.480 --> 20:01.792
No. It seems the person you identified
used the hostage situation as a cover

20:01.880 --> 20:04.075
to steal a cache of nerve
gas from the airport.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.310
Nerve gas? How do you know that?

20:06.400 --> 20:09.790
Curtis found trace amounts
in a hangar adjacent to the terminal.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.509
We don't know how much there is,
but it is a military-grade chemical weapon.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.592
- Any leads?
- We'll run the search operation.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.752
That's not gonna
track these terrorists fast enough.

20:19.840 --> 20:24.595
The only way you're gonna get that gas is if
you find out who ordered the hit on Palmer.

20:24.680 --> 20:29.356
I agree. I think David Palmer was about to
expose this plot. That's why he was killed.

20:29.440 --> 20:34.719
If you can help us identify who framed you,
we can intercept this while there's still time.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.155
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey, Bill.

20:37.240 --> 20:42.189
The president's been informed of the nerve
gas. He doesn't want the media to find out.

20:42.280 --> 20:47.957
I'll make sure Division restricts information
flow. We'll continue this when I'm done.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.397
- Good to see you again, Jack.
- It's good to see you, too, Bill.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.792
I'm so sorry about Michelle.
I never meant to put her in jeopardy.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.873
- Of course you didn't.
- How's Tony doing?

21:00.960 --> 21:05.511
He's still unconscious, but the
doctor says he's gonna pull through.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.319
Good. We need to speak to him
as soon as possible.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.595
They know to call us.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.272
Jack, Audrey has been working for us.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.913
- She's here in the building now?
- She's debriefing Diane Huxley.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.673
Why is she talking to Diane?

21:23.760 --> 21:26.194
Lynn asked her to.

21:27.800 --> 21:32.590
I'm not used to calling him Jack.
He said his name was Frank Flynn.

21:32.680 --> 21:37.708
I thought he worked for the oil company.
You probably know more about him than I do.

21:37.800 --> 21:42.510
- We all thought he was dead.
- So what do you want to know?

21:42.600 --> 21:46.229
Jack was living with you
for the last six months. Is that correct?

21:46.320 --> 21:48.914
He was renting a room.

21:49.920 --> 21:54.311
So you don't have
a personal relationship with him?

21:54.400 --> 21:57.312
- I'm not sure that's any of your business.
- I'm sorry, l...

21:57.400 --> 22:03.839
I need to know how close you and Jack were.
Whether he confided in you or not.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.593
Jack's a private person.

22:06.680 --> 22:11.834
I always knew he was keeping
something from me, I just never pushed it.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.549
I accepted him for who he was.

22:15.640 --> 22:19.713
Ms Raines, whoever he was before,

22:21.520 --> 22:24.830
doesn't change the way I feel about him.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.833
He was good to me.
He was good to my son.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.354
He meant a lot to us.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.317
He still does.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.556
I see.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.592
Did, um... did anyone ever come by
and ask about Jack?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.399
- What do you mean?
- Someone knew Jack was alive.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.756
It's critical to our investigation
that we find out who that was.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.832
No. No one ever asked about him.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.878
No one ever came to see him.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.275
Can... can you excuse me
for a minute, please?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.157
Yeah.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.231
Jack.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.918
I don't even know where to begin.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.474
I couldn't tell you I was still alive.

23:41.560 --> 23:46.156
- Jack, you don't need to apol...
- I did it for your own protection.

23:47.240 --> 23:52.109
It's been hard for me thinking that you
died believing that I was angry at you,

23:52.200 --> 23:54.270
that I hated you.

23:54.360 --> 23:57.397
I wasn't able to forgive myself for that.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.758
You had every reason to hate me. I was
responsible for Paul's death. I lied to you.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.831
Jack.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.629
You made a hard decision.

24:12.760 --> 24:17.550
I never imagined...
I'd get another chance to tell you this.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.351
But l...

24:25.360 --> 24:30.718
I want you to know that I don't blame you
for what happened with Paul.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.109
Thank you.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.712
Jack.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.830
There's so much I want to say to you.
It's not the right time...

24:42.920 --> 24:45.832
- Mr McGill needs to see you.
- I'll be right down.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.593
I should go.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.908
Evelyn. Is Mrs Logan still asleep?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.833
Yes. She's finally getting some rest.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.708
Good. You should probably
start gathering some of her things.

25:10.800 --> 25:15.999
- I thought the president was staying.
- He is. But she'll be leaving today.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.750
Where is she going?

25:18.840 --> 25:23.072
Just make sure she has the essentials
to make her trip comfortable.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.276
Yes, sir.

25:49.160 --> 25:51.196
What are you doing?

25:51.280 --> 25:55.990
Setting up a new socket.
We're overloaded from the NSC database.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.590
- Why are you here?
- Looking for you.

25:58.680 --> 26:02.593
- What for?
- I need to get into your utilities volume.

26:03.480 --> 26:08.315
- Why didn't you message me?
- I wanted to say something too. No drama.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.197
What?

26:11.320 --> 26:16.838
I was unfairly harsh to you a few minutes ago.
I didn't mean anything.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.879
All right. Apology accepted.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.999
It wasn't really an apology,
it was more of an observation. The fact...

26:26.080 --> 26:27.798
Spenser.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.830
Dammit. Why do I do that?

26:59.760 --> 27:01.512
<i>- Stiles,
- It's Chloe.</i>

27:01.600 --> 27:04.637
- What is it?
- I need to know Spenser's clearance level.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.599
- Why you asking?
- Spenser works for me and I need to know.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.956
So you could please open the header file
and give it to me?

27:12.040 --> 27:14.076
Fine.

27:15.720 --> 27:17.790
Level three.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.069
<i>Chloe.</i>

27:22.160 --> 27:25.709
Call Buchanan. Tell him
I need to talk to him now. It's important.

27:29.960 --> 27:35.717
Division sent me. One of your
mainframe servers is cycling slow.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.594
- You're not here.
- I was told it'd be taken care of.

27:38.680 --> 27:43.515
I'm gonna have to clear this
with the systems administrator.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.955
- Are you Hank? From Outside Support?
- Yeah.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.430
My fault. I was supposed to advance him
an emergency clearance.

27:49.520 --> 27:55.390
All right. Place the bag on the conveyor belt.
Walk right through, sir.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.150
- All clear.
- Thank you.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.994
Thank you. I'll show you the way.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.988
Mr Cummings told me it would be
best to keep you off the manifest.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.998
Classified material
runs on servers nine and twelve.

28:28.080 --> 28:32.198
All the information you need on Bauer
should be there.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.873
I don't know
what Cummings asked you to download,

28:35.960 --> 28:40.909
but you need to keep vector counts
the same, or it'll get flagged.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.755
I got it.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.033
OK. I need to get back to my station.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.480
Evelyn, what are you doing?

29:36.560 --> 29:39.393
Mrs Logan, are you feeling better?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.948
Why are you packing my things?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.909
Walt Cummings asked me to.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.833
Why? Where are we going?

29:48.920 --> 29:53.072
I don't know
if the president's going with you.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.754
Evelyn, stop. What's going on?

29:58.080 --> 30:01.675
They just asked me to
get you ready to leave.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.596
They're sending me to Vermont, aren't they?

30:10.560 --> 30:13.916
Charles is having me committed.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.869
I'm sorry, Mrs Logan.
I honestly don't know anything else.

30:22.880 --> 30:24.677
Fine.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.875
I'll get dressed.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.190
Edgar. My FGA is locked. Where's Chloe?

30:54.280 --> 30:56.475
How should I know?

30:58.880 --> 31:01.075
- Can you unlock this?
- No.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.393
Mr Wolff. Please come with us.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.229
- What do you want?
- Mr Buchanan ordered us to take you to him.

31:11.320 --> 31:17.270
- I'm in the middle of a critical task here.
- Mr Stiles will take over your workload.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.669
Did you know about this, Edgar?

31:19.760 --> 31:23.469
Yeah. I just got the bulletin. Sorry.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.315
Mr Wolff. Please.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.077
I'm coming.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.554
Chloe? Sir. What is going on here?

31:49.640 --> 31:52.279
Sit down, Spenser.

31:59.720 --> 32:04.236
You've been burrowing into classified
CTU protocols without authorisation.

32:04.320 --> 32:09.110
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop. You logged on to the subsystem.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.192
We're going through your system.
Tell us what you were doing.

32:12.280 --> 32:16.432
- I told you I was opening a...
- That's enough!

32:16.520 --> 32:22.311
You've accessed files outside your clearance
level at least 18 times in four months.

32:23.240 --> 32:27.472
Sir, whatever you think you've found,
it's a mistake. I've done nothing wrong.

32:27.560 --> 32:31.189
- You obviously have your own agenda here.
- I don't have an agenda.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.953
Why don't you explain
why you had to crawl into my bed,

32:34.040 --> 32:39.398
which wasn't what it appeared to be, just like
your work here isn't what it appears to be?

32:42.320 --> 32:44.197
Let me handle this.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.875
Sir, you can't take anything she says
into consideration.

32:47.960 --> 32:52.715
I was careless, and inadvertently,
I caused her some emotional pain.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.429
- Oh, please.
- And now she's trying to get back at me.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.717
- I don't think so.
- Sir, I'd like to talk to a lawyer.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.794
Forget about a lawyer. We're in the middle of
a terrorist crisis. There are lives on the line.

33:04.880 --> 33:09.954
You're going to tell us what you've been
doing here, and you're going to tell us now.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.158
I hope this goes better than the last time.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.995
- Dr Hill and his staff are on stand-by.
- I'm not looking forward to this.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.798
- Evelyn.
- Mr President.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.440
- Where is she?
- She's in the bathroom, sir.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.032
Martha!

33:35.480 --> 33:37.277
Marty!

33:39.640 --> 33:43.713
- Are you sure she's in there?
- Yes, sir. She's getting dressed.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.716
Marty.

34:08.320 --> 34:10.275
Aaron, my wife is gone.

34:10.360 --> 34:15.514
This is Pierce. We have a priority alert.
The first lady is unaccounted for.

34:15.600 --> 34:20.594
All agents, move north and west.
Anyone spotting her, check in immediately.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.476
Got it,

34:39.400 --> 34:43.518
So the only people who knew you were alive
were Palmer, Tony, Michelle and Chloe.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.114
And at least one other person
who killed Palmer and tried to frame me.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.078
- And you don't know who that might be?
- No.

34:50.159 --> 34:53.311
Any theories?

34:53.400 --> 34:58.428
David Palmer called me. Told me someone
in Logan's administration was targeting me.

34:58.520 --> 35:03.878
- Which is why you faked your own death.
- Yeah. Except it didn't work.

35:03.960 --> 35:08.590
I believe that whoever tried to kill me
18 months ago found out I was still alive,

35:08.680 --> 35:11.069
and waited until today to exploit that.

35:11.160 --> 35:14.311
Someone inside
President Logan's administration.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.437
That's what David Palmer told me then,
and I believe him.

35:17.520 --> 35:22.230
That means someone in this administration
is also tied to the theft of the nerve gas.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.392
Yeah. You're gonna have to look into that.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.153
There are hundreds of people
in the administration.

35:28.240 --> 35:32.233
It would take an investigation of that
magnitude months to gain any traction.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.630
<i>Mr McGill,
Dr Paulson is calling from Medical.</i>

35:35.720 --> 35:37.551
<i>- Put him through.
- Mr McGill,</i>

35:37.640 --> 35:42.077
<i>- Yes?
- Tony Almeida has regained consciousness,</i>

35:42.160 --> 35:45.835
<i>- Can he talk?
- Yes, He 's very weak, You'll have to be brief,</i>

35:45.920 --> 35:49.879
<i>- I'll be down in a few minutes.
- Tony asked if he could speak to Jack Bauer,</i>

35:49.960 --> 35:52.349
Says it's important,

35:52.440 --> 35:54.590
He's a friend of mine.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.911
- Jack will be down in a few moments.
- I'll let him know,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.036
Thank you. I'll be right back.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.076
- Jack.
- What's going on?

36:10.160 --> 36:14.199
I know you're busy,
but... I just wanted to apologise.

36:14.280 --> 36:17.955
- You have nothing to apologise for.
- Yes, I do.

36:18.040 --> 36:23.319
I thought you were just another loser
trying to take advantage of my mom.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.516
I was wrong.

36:26.600 --> 36:31.833
You were trying to protect her. Your mother
is lucky that you love her so much.

36:32.360 --> 36:36.717
As soon as this is over, I promise you,
you and I are gonna get a chance to talk.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.837
- Right now, I have to go.
- Yeah.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.069
Take care of your mother.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.754
Who gave you the level five authorisation?

36:53.840 --> 36:57.071
- Don't look at me. Answer him!
- I can't.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.230
I can't talk to anyone here about this.

36:59.320 --> 37:02.596
Whatever you were doing is over, Spenser.

37:03.640 --> 37:06.757
I pulled Spenser's screen activity
from the archive.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.195
This is what he was looking at
ten minutes ago.

37:09.280 --> 37:14.115
Looks like he was using in-house
surveillance to track someone through CTU.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.996
Why are you tracking Jack Bauer?

37:18.080 --> 37:21.390
I'm sure if they're tracking Jack Bauer,
they have a reason.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.153
Who is "they"?

37:27.760 --> 37:29.716
I won't say anything else.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.351
Chloe, phone security.
Have them locate Jack now.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.232
- Dr Paulson?
- Yes.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.231
Jack Bauer for Tony Almeida.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.835
Oh, of course, Mr Bauer.
Just remember to please keep it brief.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.911
Thank you, sir.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.716
Tony.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.677
Tony, it's Jack.

39:05.280 --> 39:08.238
Jack! Are you all right?

39:08.320 --> 39:10.356
I think he cracked my rib.

39:10.440 --> 39:13.796
The lines were locked out.
What happened? Who is he?

39:13.880 --> 39:17.429
He's a professional.
He killed Dr Paulson, and tried to kill me.

39:17.520 --> 39:22.150
- You have any idea how he got into CTU?
- We identified a mole in Chloe's department.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.949
- Who?
- Spenser Wolff. He hasn't talked yet.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.473
- Where is he?
- Holding.

39:27.560 --> 39:31.269
Get a doctor down here to monitor
Tony Almeida now. Lock this room down.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.193
Contact Lynn McGill.
Have him meet me at Holding.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.953
Bring up visual surveillance
on medical room two.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.952
Open the door.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.793
I want to show you something. Get up!

40:09.640 --> 40:14.794
Did you let that man into CTU? This man is
a professional assassin. He killed Dr Paulson.

40:14.880 --> 40:20.591
- Did you let him into CTU?!
- They said he was here to tap the server.

40:20.680 --> 40:21.999
Who?

40:22.080 --> 40:26.631
I was here as part of
an lnternal Affairs investigation.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.349
Do you understand how much trouble
you are in? One more chance.

40:30.440 --> 40:33.512
Who told you to let that man into CTU?

40:34.720 --> 40:38.872
The White House.
Mr Cummings. The White House.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.269
Cummings recruited me.

40:41.360 --> 40:47.037
He said that they wanted to make sure
that CTU was operating within the rules.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.513
You have to believe me.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.239
I thought I was serving the president.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.158
Yeah. Take him back to Holding.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.911
Walt Cummings killed David Palmer.
He tried to have me killed.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.117
We have to build a case
before we call the president.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.237
We don't call him - he's here in California.
We go see him now.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.198
Cummings is the president's
chief of staff and friend.

41:18.280 --> 41:22.512
- Without hard evidence, CTU can't touch him.
- I'm not CTU.

41:24.280 --> 41:27.431
I'll go get Walt Cummings myself.

41:28.305 --> 41:34.230
