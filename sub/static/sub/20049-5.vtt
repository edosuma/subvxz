Hey, Jeff.

Go get her.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.681
[Clay] Go get her and do what?

01:48.770 --> 01:50.226
It's a dance.

01:51.230 --> 01:52.106
Dance with her.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.430
I can't.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.066
You know I can't dance.

01:55.190 --> 01:56.316

I've ever seen you do laundry.

Jesus, Mom, no, I'm not seven.
I got hot last night.

-I can do my own laundry.
-In 17 years,

[sniffs]

05:10.260 --> 05:11.090
Did you shower?

05:12.430 --> 05:13.476
I totally showered.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.806
I feel it's possible you didn't shower.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.219
I didn't shower.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.476
Did you shower last night?

05:21.190 --> 05:22.475
Look, I just...

05:24.110 --> 05:26.146
I turned the water on just now,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.401
and I thought about it all,
the whole thing,

05:28.490 --> 05:31.232
taking clothes off, dealing with hair,
and I just...

05:31.790 --> 05:32.825
I couldn't do it.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.030
Look, we shower, like...

05:36.870 --> 05:39.077
every day, and it's just...

05:40.420 --> 05:41.455
a lot.

Okay.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.216

05:48.680 --> 05:50.796
I need to discuss something with you.

05:50.890 --> 05:51.845
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

05:52.180 --> 05:55.058
I'm meeting someone at Monet's
for a school project.

something going on with him.

06:10.910 --> 06:15.609
Can I have a triple Americano to go,
please? My name is Clay.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.157
Coﬁ'ee together, every morning.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.152
Your opening paragraph is so strong.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.459
I love the parallel you make
between Snowball in
Animal Farm

06:59.540 --> 07:00.609
and Hosni Mubarak.

07:00.710 --> 07:01.699
Thanks, Dad.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.838
But here's the thing...
then you get more general.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.330
You just need more specifics.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.489
Got it. Yeah, you're right.

07:06.590 --> 07:08.660
[Hannah]
And you ’re also very nice, Courtney

07:09.550 --> 07:10.926
Everyone says so.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.216
You're really blowing up this morning,
sweetheart.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.710
Social or school?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.131
Uh, it's a big test.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.926
You know, everyone's freaking out
about it. It's the usual.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.687
You ’re nice to everyone...

07:22.770 --> 07:24.010
all the hme.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.179
Um...

07:27.530 --> 07:28.519
I should go.

07:28.610 --> 07:31.943
I have to stop by the florist on the way
to school, for Hannah's memorial.

07:32.070 --> 07:34.311
Oh, hey, don't forget dinner tonight
with the Simonsons.

07:34.410 --> 07:35.695
Bring a friend from school.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.691
-Oh, maybe Marcus.
-I do love that Marcus.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.361
He's a good one.
You'd make beautiful babies.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.821
Dear God, honey, you cannot say that.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.530
Why not? It's a hypothetical.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.530
It is racist and it's sexist.

07:46.630 --> 07:49.167
Marcus and I are just friends.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.120
I should go. See you tonight.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.085
-Yeah. Have a great day.
-Go kick ass.

popular girls in school.

08:38.050 --> 08:41.019
-That picture's all over school.
-Yeah. That can happen, can't it?

08:41.100 --> 08:42.476
What are you trying to do?

08:43.180 --> 08:44.181
Anything.

08:44.940 --> 08:48.228
I'm trying to do something, anything,
which is more than any of you did.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.687
Well, I'm the only one
catching any shit for it, okay?

08:50.780 --> 08:53.396
Who the whole school's laughing at,
the only one you've done something about.

08:53.490 --> 08:54.696
So far.

08:54.950 --> 08:56.599
You're the only one so far.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.169
Thank you.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.512
I didn't know Clay Jensen did dances.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.478
Clay Jensen lost a bet to Jeff Atkins.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.766
[girls giggle]

09:28.860 --> 09:31.567
It's cute how Clay talks about himself
in third person.

09:31.650 --> 09:33.311
[Courtney]
Here's your ticket, handsome.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.607
Remember, it's formal,
so no exposed midriffs.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.697
-Got it.
-And I hope you'll save a dance for me.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.238
Um... Sure. I don't actually dance.

09:43.330 --> 09:44.570
Hey, Helmet!

09:44.660 --> 09:45.740
Oh, hey.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.279
Are you going to this?

09:47.870 --> 09:48.871
Ooh. Uh...

09:49.380 --> 09:50.870
Don't think so.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.337
Not really in a romantic
winter dance place.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.580
[Courtney]
But you totally should be.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.757
I mean, lots of cute guys
bought tickets today.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.829
Mm-hmm.

09:58.930 --> 10:02.172
Besides, can't the best ass
in the sophomore class find a date?

10:02.260 --> 10:03.306
[girls laughing]

10:04.180 --> 10:05.590
Ladies, please.

10:05.680 --> 10:08.808
No objectifying comments, okay?
We have to stick together.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.101
Girl power, right?

10:10.940 --> 10:13.010
Well, Hannah,
you should totally come.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.396
There will be many
single hot guys there.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.811
Clay. Well, she should go, right?

10:19.740 --> 10:20.866
Um...

10:22.530 --> 10:23.986
Sure, yeah.

10:24.870 --> 10:25.859
Yes.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.571
I should, uh... it's class and stuff.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.160
[bell rings]

10:36.550 --> 10:38.620
[Jessica] I thought you said
nothing's changed.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.676
[Justin] Yeah, 'cause nothing has changed.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.426
-Justin, don't.
-I'm not gonna do anything.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.345
[Justin] Clay.

10:50.940 --> 10:51.975
Clay!

10:52.060 --> 10:53.049
Jensen!

10:54.610 --> 10:55.770
Hey, Justin.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.145
That's a pretty picture
you took of Tyler.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.941
Not as pretty as the one
he took of Hannah.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.157
You made your point.
Now shut it down.

11:01.950 --> 11:04.111
"Shut it down"?
Who talks like that?

11:05.410 --> 11:06.991
This is beyond just us now.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.115
This is the whole school.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.496
If we fail, you go down with us.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.546
Maybe I don't care.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.376
Maybe you should.

11:22.470 --> 11:23.459
[phone chimes]

11:32.270 --> 11:34.761
Okay, look, calm down.
No one can tell that's us.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.724
Oh, come on, Hannah.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.779
You of all people should know
what a picture can do to a person's life.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.311
[Hannah]
I hoped we could be friends, Courtney.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.229
I needed a friend.

11:47.410 --> 11:48.570
I think you did too.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.706
Who do you think it is?

11:52.420 --> 11:53.409
Duh.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.336
I don't think so.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.338
I have gym with her,
and she only wears sports bras.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.041
Maybe I save my nice shit
for after hours.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.757
[class laughing]

12:04.260 --> 12:06.251
Damn, girl, you are slick!

12:07.680 --> 12:10.342
Listen, Laura, you ever
want to swing the other way...

12:11.390 --> 12:13.017
You'd be the last person I called.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.391
Right before the police.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.765
[laughing]

12:17.020 --> 12:19.272
[Hannah]
But you had some secrets
that you wanted to keep,

12:19.610 --> 12:20.986
even from yourse/ﬁ

12:22.200 --> 12:23.315
[teacher]
Courtney.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.315
Courtney!

12:26.660 --> 12:27.649
Sorry.

12:28.990 --> 12:29.866
Um, can I...

12:30.700 --> 12:31.951
I need to go to the office.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.619
Hello, Courtney.

12:37.710 --> 12:40.087
Hi, Miss Douglas, how are you?
It's so good to see you.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.546
How are the Shih Tzu's?

12:41.630 --> 12:43.006
-Um, they--
-I have the agenda

12:43.090 --> 12:45.672
for student council.
Could I please get 40 copies?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.137
I don't see why not.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.552
Hi. Lainie Jensen to see Principal Bolan.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.268
Of course. Um...
He will be with you in a moment.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.766
You're Clay's mom.

12:53.850 --> 12:55.181
Yes.

12:55.270 --> 12:56.646
We love Clay.

12:57.650 --> 12:59.220
We do too, most of the time.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.179
I'll be right back.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.106
Everybody loves Clay.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.729
Hi, I'm Courtney.

13:07.990 --> 13:09.366
I Gan/J
Your son is Clay.

13:09.700 --> 13:10.985
Yes, Clay.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.650
He's a junior this year.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.071
How's he been handling
the past few weeks?

13:16.420 --> 13:18.035
To be honest, I don't know for sure.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.449
It's been difficult to tell.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.088
_ We've lost two students
In the space of two months.

13:24.420 --> 13:26.672
It's been a difficult time for all of us.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.172
Did he know Hannah Baker well?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.090
He says he didn't.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.174
Either way,

13:32.270 --> 13:34.841
it_'s had such a terrible
Impact on everyone.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.339
Hence... you.

13:38.230 --> 13:39.470
Yes, me.

13:40.060 --> 13:43.735
Gary, I'd like to start
with a conversation, nothing more.

13:43.820 --> 13:44.980
Just about Liberty.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.527
The climate here, the challenges.

13:47.610 --> 13:49.658
It would be very helpful for me
to have context.

13:49.740 --> 13:50.775
Sure. Anything you need.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.656
Kevin Porter is a counselor here?

13:56.750 --> 13:57.956
Uh, yes.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.628
And how many students
is each counselor...

14:02.800 --> 14:04.700
[woman] All right.
Have her come to my office.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.081
[Tyler] They pantsed me
in the middle of the hallway.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.217
I don't know what that means.
They pantsed you?

14:12.600 --> 14:14.056
How could you not know what that means?

14:14.140 --> 14:15.471
You work at a high school.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.302
The school I transferred from,
kids shot kids.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.720
Pants I don't know.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.259
They just...

14:23.360 --> 14:25.180
they just pulled my pants down.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.560
-In the middle of the hallway.
-Who did?

14:27.650 --> 14:30.448
[sighs] I don't know. Like, five people.

14:30.530 --> 14:33.738
I don't understand how it is that
I'm always getting screwed wrth,

14:33.830 --> 14:35.445
but I'm the one that gets
sent to the office?

14:35.540 --> 14:37.030
Well, let's start with...

14:38.500 --> 14:40.491
what is it that you can do
to protect yourself?

14:41.210 --> 14:44.338
What is anything you're doing
that might provoke kids?

14:44.920 --> 14:45.830
Are you serious?

14:47.840 --> 14:50.047
That's convenient. Blame the victim.

14:50.130 --> 14:51.381
No, no one's blaming anyone.

14:51.470 --> 14:53.097
Okay, well, maybe we should be.

14:54.760 --> 14:59.220
You should be blaming the kids
that make this school a terrible place.

15:00.350 --> 15:03.399
You should be blaming the kids that
make other kids want to kill themselves.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.026
Are you referring to Hannah Baker?

15:07.110 --> 15:08.350
What do you think?

15:10.740 --> 15:12.116
Do you want to talk about Hannah?

15:12.820 --> 15:13.866
Do you?

15:15.450 --> 15:16.781
If it's on your mind.

15:17.580 --> 15:18.786
Isn't it on yours?

15:21.830 --> 15:22.990
Of course.

15:25.590 --> 15:26.909
Yeah, I bet it is.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.546
-Tyler.
-Nah, thanks.

15:29.630 --> 15:30.790
Tyler.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.966
[door closes]

15:36.470 --> 15:37.926
[indistinct chatter]

15:42.100 --> 15:43.761
I don't know what Justin's going to do.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.260
He says he wants to shut Clay down.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.850
[scoffs] We tried that.

15:47.940 --> 15:49.737
Clay must have listened to his tape.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.311
I told you, he listens to his tape,
everything changes.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.446
He hasn't listen to his tape.
He just heard Tyler.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.361
He didn't say anything
about Jessica's party.

15:56.450 --> 15:59.283
But when he does,
he'll probably believe Hannah.

15:59.660 --> 16:01.070
He won't know that she's lying.

16:04.460 --> 16:05.916
Clay's mom came to see Bolan.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.495
What? Why?

16:08.840 --> 16:10.159
What else could it be?

16:10.260 --> 16:11.909
Clay wouldn't tell his mom
about the tapes.

16:12.010 --> 16:14.217
Why not? He wasn't shy about Tyler.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.211
That would be so messed up
if he told his mom.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.716
I'm with Justin.
We need to do something serious.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.631
What, so your mom doesn't find out?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.595
Yeah, among other people,
like maybe your dad.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.147
[Marcus] What can we do,
if he's already rated us out?

16:25.480 --> 16:28.313
I'm on track for valedictorian.
I do not need this shit.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.143
Yes, Marcus, the most important thing
right now is your valedictorian speech.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.446
Let's keep that in mind.

16:33.530 --> 16:34.656
You talking about Clay?

16:34.990 --> 16:36.400
Keep your voice down, dude.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.281
Whatever you're doing, I want in.

16:39.370 --> 16:41.611
We're not doing anything, Tyler.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.070
It's not like we would trust you
if we were.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.410
This... this isn't fair.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.161
Dude, get the hell out.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.620
Seriously.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.926
I have a right to be here, guys--

16:55.010 --> 16:57.137
I will snap your arm in two.

17:04.850 --> 17:06.056
[Courtney] Let me deal with it.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.015
Okay? Quietly.

17:09.110 --> 17:10.475
No snapping of arms.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.816
[Hannah]
For days after Tyleris
picture went around

17:18.910 --> 17:20.320
I tried to catch your eye.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.240
You ignored me for weeks.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.456
But I decided enough was enough.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.371
I mean, we were in this together...

17:37.180 --> 17:37.999
weren ’t we?

17:39.600 --> 17:40.715
Hey.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.095
That seat's taken.

17:42.350 --> 17:43.669
Yeah, by me.

17:45.810 --> 17:46.720
Talk to me.

17:46.810 --> 17:47.640
About what?

17:48.480 --> 17:49.515
I thought we were friends.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.145
We are friends.

17:52.610 --> 17:53.895
I mean, it seemed like we were.

17:54.610 --> 17:57.238
Whatever you're going through now,
you don't have to do it alone.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.605
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:58.700 --> 17:59.985
Like you said...

18:00.870 --> 18:03.031
I know what it feels like
to have people judge you.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.195
And it sucks.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.662
And it helps to have a friend
who doesn't judge you.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.911
[girl]
I thought we were eating together.

18:15.590 --> 18:17.751
Uh, sorry, I'll go.

18:18.550 --> 18:19.756
See you around, Courtney.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.551
No. Stay.

18:22.890 --> 18:23.959
Have lunch.

18:24.060 --> 18:25.846
There's room for everybody.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.930
We were gonna talk about the dance.

18:29.230 --> 18:30.720
You're going, right?

18:31.770 --> 18:33.260
-Well, I--
-Can you drive?

18:33.360 --> 18:34.770
Because I'm restricted,

18:34.860 --> 18:38.148
and Courtney's dads are just strict,
and Ashley's car's old.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.310
-It's not that old.
-It's older than me.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.946
[all laugh]

18:44.200 --> 18:45.610
[Mrs Baker]
A limo?

18:45.700 --> 18:47.247
Honey, we can't afford a limo.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.867
-What were you thinking?
-How about we split it?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.916
I've got a bunch of money
saved from the Crestmont.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.581
A car for the night, with a driver?

18:53.670 --> 18:55.706
We're talking probably $500,
probably more.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.667
-Why don't you take the Jeep?
-The Jeep is a hundred years old.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.297
The Jeep's not a hundred years old.
It's not even paid off yet.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.039
Why don't you take the station wagon?

19:03.140 --> 19:05.005
'Cause that's so much better.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.341
You guys, I'm trying to have friends,

19:07.430 --> 19:09.478
you know, like you guys
are always talking about.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.222
Sweetie, your friends are not
going to like or dislike you for a car.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.437
Mom, it's high school.
Of course they will.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.067
Listen, I was in high school.

19:16.150 --> 19:18.732
Yeah, but you have no idea,
because you were popular, I'm not.

19:20.030 --> 19:20.849
Hannah.

19:20.950 --> 19:22.065
Yeah, well, it's true.

19:24.410 --> 19:25.616
Well, you were.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.570
No. The answer is no.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.216
[Mr. Baker]
They're coming to pick up the box.

19:46.470 --> 19:47.459
"Evidence."

19:50.060 --> 19:50.970
So clinical.

19:51.060 --> 19:51.936
Well...

19:53.100 --> 19:54.601
it's their label.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.773
Maybe we need to be looking
through her room again.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.236
We've been through--

19:59.320 --> 20:01.641
No, we threw things in a box.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.368
I mean, we need to dig deeper.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.860
There's something we're missing.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.531
They asked for schoolbooks,

20:07.620 --> 20:10.578
papers, photos, mementos.

20:10.660 --> 20:13.242
Let's let them start with this
and see what they say.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.819
It's a full carton.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.665
[door opens]

20:40.110 --> 20:41.486
Ah, honey.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.389
Oh, you're beautiful.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.559
Dad.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.111
It's true.
I never looked so lovely for a dance.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.656
That's ridiculous.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.729
Hannah".

20:50.240 --> 20:53.949
you are the most beautiful woman
in this family.

20:55.040 --> 20:57.281
I'd agree, but I'd be in trouble
with both of you.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.045
Here you are.

21:00.130 --> 21:02.587
-Perfect.
-Aw, thanks, Dad. It's beautiful.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.375
Just a little smile.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.961
Aah! Oh, come on, now.
There you go.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.886
Honey, and I'm sorry. I'm...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.926
I'm sorry we couldn't afford
to give you that limo.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.306
Mom, it's okay, really.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.390
Can I have the keys?

21:18.730 --> 21:19.936
You can.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.392
You just have to take off the tag...

21:24.360 --> 21:25.600
because...

21:30.330 --> 21:31.365
Andy.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.611
-You got a new car?
-You got a new car?

21:33.700 --> 21:35.452
I upgraded the lease.
It's a simple trade.

21:35.540 --> 21:37.167
-For the same payment?
-A bit more.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.626
[Hannah screams]

21:38.710 --> 21:41.417
It's worth it.
It's the winter formal, Liv.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.620
Oh, it's... it's great!

21:43.710 --> 21:45.621
-Thank you, Daddy.
-He's the hero, as always.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.926
You're the best.

21:47.010 --> 21:47.999
Go.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.171
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Be careful!

21:52.260 --> 21:54.012
-[Hannah laughs]
-[alarm chirps]

21:56.190 --> 21:57.259
Oh, my God!

21:59.770 --> 22:01.431
-[engine starts]
-Well. ..

22:08.700 --> 22:10.520
[Courtney] I love this car.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.269
It has that new car smell.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.320
Oh, my God.

22:14.410 --> 22:16.822
Did your parents buy you
a new car for this dance?

22:16.910 --> 22:18.912
Um... Kind of.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.582
Holy crap!
I didn't know you were rich!

22:22.210 --> 22:25.623
Oh, my God. Stephanie, you can
think that shit, but you can't say it.

22:28.430 --> 22:29.795
Oh... designated driver.

22:31.970 --> 22:32.846
Let's go in?

22:32.930 --> 22:34.420
[Courtney] Here we go!

22:54.910 --> 22:55.729
Thanks.

22:56.790 --> 22:57.779
Wow.

22:57.870 --> 22:58.825
I know, right?

22:58.910 --> 23:01.822
It took the sophomores, like, two days,
and I made them redo it twice.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.740
[Tyler] Looking good, ladies. Come on.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.289
That's perfect.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.419
Let's go dance.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.754
Seriously, Tyler?

23:15.850 --> 23:17.420
It's for the yearbook.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.340
I don't care. Don't put it in my face.

23:21.270 --> 23:22.259
Hannah.

23:22.350 --> 23:23.351
You look good.

23:25.820 --> 23:26.809
Hey.

23:26.940 --> 23:27.929
Hey.

23:28.820 --> 23:29.809
Who'd you come here with?

23:30.110 --> 23:31.566
Oh, just Courtney.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.059
And her court.

23:33.410 --> 23:34.525
The Courtnettes.

23:34.700 --> 23:35.689
Yeah.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.076
You?

23:37.410 --> 23:38.399
Big date?

23:38.500 --> 23:39.649
It was supposed to be.

23:40.960 --> 23:41.779
Hey.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.701
Uh, hey.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.990
I should... yeah.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.289
Uh...

23:50.670 --> 23:51.796
You look amazing.

23:52.130 --> 23:53.677
Good enough to make your next list?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.557
Look, I'll say, like, a million times
that I'm sorry.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.050
-Don't say it.
-I love you.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.011
You said it. Wow.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.227
-I'll say it again if that helps.
-No.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.266
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.930
Is this happening again?
You're back together?

24:07.020 --> 24:09.739
Not unless this is
the Hell Freezes Over dance.

24:09.820 --> 24:12.027
Sad thing is,
that'd be a really good theme.

24:13.780 --> 24:14.735
Later.

24:17.700 --> 24:20.077
Okay, seriously,
how does he get all the hot girls?

24:20.410 --> 24:21.456
I mean...

24:21.960 --> 24:23.780
his dick must be huge.

24:24.210 --> 24:27.168
Only one huge dick in the vicinity
at the moment, Bryce.

24:27.590 --> 24:29.330
Whoo! She's talking about you, big guy.

24:29.670 --> 24:30.705
Yeah, she is.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.005
Sorry about him.

24:35.550 --> 24:37.632
Lots of money, just no class.

24:37.930 --> 24:38.840
Right. [scoffs]

24:39.520 --> 24:40.589
You do look amazing, though.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.061
Hey, where'd you guys go?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.769
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.151
We thought you were right behind us.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.446
Come dance with us.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.661
Well, hello there, ladies.

25:05.620 --> 25:08.919
So, are we gonna be seeing
an encore presentation tonight, or what?

25:09.090 --> 25:10.296
What are you talking about?

25:10.380 --> 25:13.042
You're gonna try and tell me that these
babes right here aren't you guys?

25:13.220 --> 25:15.871
_ Come on.
I know a fine piece when I see one.

25:16.300 --> 25:17.380
Or two.

25:17.470 --> 25:19.506
So, is this a thing now?
Did you guys come here together?

25:19.600 --> 25:22.558
We came as friends.
Maybe one day you'll have some.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.446
Oh, hey.

25:37.450 --> 25:39.691
Aren't you supposed to get on the mic
and say things like,

25:39.780 --> 25:42.112
"Hey, Liberty High, let's keep it tight!"

25:42.200 --> 25:44.828
I'm a legit deejay, not a birthday clown.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.411
Those aren't the only options.

25:46.750 --> 25:49.287
You see the world as binary.
It's a mosaic.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.199
Oh, God.

25:50.290 --> 25:52.042
Look at this mass of humanity.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.199
Hundreds of stories.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.040
It's kind of beautiful.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.880
And romantic.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.539
Yeah.

26:00.390 --> 26:01.425
Kind of is.

26:35.510 --> 26:36.329
[Jeff] Go.

26:37.970 --> 26:38.789
Go get her.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.834
Go get her and do what?

26:41.180 --> 26:42.636
It's a dance, right?

26:43.140 --> 26:45.051
Maybe dance with her?

26:45.640 --> 26:47.722
I can't... You know I can't dance.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.261
We talked about this when you
forced me to come tonight.

26:50.350 --> 26:52.147
Nobody can dance. Look.

26:53.020 --> 26:55.602
When people can dance at a dance,
nobody likes 'em.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.351
I didn't force you to come.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.193
We made a bet, and I got higher
than a "C," so you lost.

27:00.530 --> 27:01.610
Now, go.

27:02.570 --> 27:03.571
Come on.

27:18.130 --> 27:18.960
[Tony] Clay.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.005
Clay!

27:23.600 --> 27:25.340
You're missing out on the fun run.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.057
It's three miles of torture.
What part of that is fun?

27:29.980 --> 27:31.265
Calling it fun is Orwellian.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.187
And why do you care if I miss it?

27:34.270 --> 27:35.897
Who else is gonna call it Orwellian?

27:41.280 --> 27:42.099
[sniffs]

27:44.530 --> 27:45.986
Are you sure you didn't run already?

27:46.450 --> 27:47.735
I had a late night.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.701
I'm aware.

27:52.750 --> 27:54.490
Listen, Clay,
what you did to Tyler, that's--

27:54.590 --> 27:56.160
I don't want to hear it, Tony.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.580
I feel you, brother, but still.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.295
That shit's not helping.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.215
I don't want to help.

28:08.140 --> 28:10.131
I... want to hurt.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.589
Hurt who?

28:21.360 --> 28:24.272
Do you remember the winter dance,
the one you deejayed?

28:24.870 --> 28:25.939
Sure.

28:26.450 --> 28:30.284
You remember that song you played,
that one slow song?

28:31.120 --> 28:32.530
That one slow song?

28:33.040 --> 28:35.702
Uh... I'm gonna need some more, Clay.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.082
It was the most amazing song.

28:41.800 --> 28:46.009
-["The Night W_e Met" playing]
Ooh

28:48.890 --> 28:54.556
Ooh

Ooh

29:03.490 --> 29:09.486
Ooh

29:10.990 --> 29:15.495
I am not the only traveler

29:18.040 --> 29:21.453
Who has not repaid his debt

29:24.380 --> 29:29.545
I ’ve been searching
For a had to follow

29:29.850 --> 29:31.340
Again

29:31.430 --> 29:35.719
Take me back to the n/ght we met...

29:40.570 --> 29:41.935
You look adorable.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.106
There's that word again.

29:45.570 --> 29:47.026
-You look adorable.
-[rock music playing]

29:47.660 --> 29:48.729
There's that word again.

29:49.070 --> 29:50.480
I didn't know you were here.

29:51.450 --> 29:53.498
Yeah, I get that a lot. I blend.

29:53.580 --> 29:55.286
A skill I wish I had.

29:56.870 --> 29:57.950
So, um...

29:58.460 --> 30:00.121
I'm not really sure how this is done,

30:00.210 --> 30:01.950
uh, and I'm already being too formal.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.790
Although it is the winter formal.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.668
I don't know if people actually
ask people this in the world,

30:07.880 --> 30:09.586
but I'm just saying...

30:10.720 --> 30:12.051
I wonder if you want to dance.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.341
I would love to dance.

30:15.890 --> 30:17.471
Awesome. Okay. Cool.

30:17.770 --> 30:19.180
[fast rock music continues]

30:20.690 --> 30:23.067
_ I don't think this
IS a song you can dance to.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.270
Like, with someone.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.275
Yeah.

30:28.110 --> 30:29.316
I mean, we could just...

30:30.320 --> 30:31.617
jump around together.

30:32.910 --> 30:33.865
Oh.

30:33.950 --> 30:35.110
You mean like this?

30:37.620 --> 30:40.032
Yeah, or, uh, or no, more...

30:40.420 --> 30:41.535
more like this.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.410
[Hannah laughing]

31:02.060 --> 31:03.641
-Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Courtney] Whoo!

31:03.730 --> 31:05.778
Courtney Crimsen cuts loose!

31:06.230 --> 31:07.231
I like it!

31:07.320 --> 31:08.810
You here alone, or you with someone?

31:08.900 --> 31:10.106
I'm here with my friends.

31:10.610 --> 31:11.611
We could be friends.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.236
-Go!
-Go!

31:13.910 --> 31:14.945
Do it.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.155
You think so?

31:16.240 --> 31:17.491
Uh, you can keep up?

31:19.960 --> 31:21.700
Oh! [chuckles]

31:22.330 --> 31:23.240
Hey.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.126
Maybe you and Hannah
are up for some fun later.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.417
-Me and Hannah?
-Yeah. You're fun girls, right?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.466
That's what it looks like in the picture.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.211
Hate to disappoint you, Monty,
but I'll tell you a secret.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.675
[whispering]

31:41.900 --> 31:42.798
[Justin sputters]

31:46.190 --> 31:49.239
Oh, come on, keep up, be a man.
I'm way ahead of you.

31:49.530 --> 31:50.519
Fine.

31:51.490 --> 31:52.605
[Justin laughs]

31:53.370 --> 31:55.941
Holy fuck!
I don't usually do hard liquor.

[laughing]

32:09.210 --> 32:10.256
[music stops]

32:11.170 --> 32:13.673
All right, Liberty High,
let's slow it down a bit,

32:13.760 --> 32:15.716
nice and smooth.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.552
["The Night We Met" playing]

32:19.640 --> 32:21.221
Well, you happy now?

32:21.520 --> 32:22.339
Iam.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.556
I'm embarrassed to admit
that I am very happy.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.947
Tony has amazing taste.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.946
This song is perfect.

32:37.030 --> 32:38.110
Yeah.

32:38.910 --> 32:41.287
I am not the only traveler

32:41.370 --> 32:43.247
So, I guess we should...

I ’ve been searching
For a had to follow

32:57.760 --> 32:59.091
Again

32:59.510 --> 33:03.389
Take me back to the n/ght we met...

33:06.770 --> 33:09.352
This song kinda reminds
me of those old dance movies

33:09.440 --> 33:10.896
we play sometimes at the Crestmont.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.981
Remember
Strict/y Ballroom?

33:13.070 --> 33:14.856
Oh, my God, I love that movie.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.525
"There are no new steps!"

33:23.290 --> 33:24.154
You lied to me.

33:24.710 --> 33:26.826
-What?
-You said you had no rhythm.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.126
You dance like a pro.

33:29.670 --> 33:31.752
I've actually taken ballet
since I was six.

33:32.550 --> 33:33.665
No shit. Seriously?

33:34.010 --> 33:35.045
No.

33:38.090 --> 33:39.387
I would have believed it.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.800
You're full of little surprises.

33:47.350 --> 33:48.351
Yeah.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.686
Stick with me, kid.

33:51.270 --> 33:53.932
Stay with me? Stick with me.
Whatever. Sorry.

34:18.550 --> 34:19.710
Dear Lord.

34:21.970 --> 34:23.346
I should go take care of that.

34:24.470 --> 34:25.801
Yeah, for sure.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.056
Hey, where's your girlfriend?

34:30.690 --> 34:33.181
Sorry, which girlfriend is that, exactly?

34:33.360 --> 34:35.237
Your girlfriend from the picture, Laura.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.601
I hear you two like a guy
between you now and then.

34:38.740 --> 34:39.900
Who'd you hear that from?

34:39.990 --> 34:41.821
Courtney says
you asked her for a three-way.

34:42.370 --> 34:43.940
I don't blame you. She's hot.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.826
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

-No, it's no good.
-See, I think it is.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.128
'Cause she confirmed that not only
did Justin finger you,

34:53.210 --> 34:54.416
but that you went down on him.

It's good shit.

Oh. Hey, Cory.

What the fuck, Courtney?

35:14.900 --> 35:15.889
Hannah, I...

35:15.980 --> 35:17.641
You think you can just
throw me under the bus?

"Everyone already thinks she's a slut.
So why not just pile on?"

35:21.660 --> 35:23.821
People were starting to talk. I just...

35:26.040 --> 35:28.577
I had... I had to do something.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.667
Yeah, well, you didn't have to do that.

35:32.000 --> 35:32.819
I'm sorry.

35:32.920 --> 35:34.911
I want to be your friend, Courtney.

and this thing you're scared
for people to know about you

35:39.220 --> 35:40.619
doesn't matter to me.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.506
Okay, it doesn't fucking matter.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.058
And I'm sorry if you're scared,

35:45.140 --> 35:46.676
but I'm not your shield, okay?

35:46.770 --> 35:48.670
You don't get to hide behind me.

35:48.930 --> 35:51.683

because you don't like who you are.

Hey, Clay. What's up?

Listen, what you said the other day...

36:18.300 --> 36:19.415
Uh-huh?

36:19.510 --> 36:20.625
I, um...

36:21.170 --> 36:22.626
I haven't been doing so well,

36:22.720 --> 36:26.804
and I wonder if we could
go somewhere and talk.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.379
Yeah. Of course.

36:29.890 --> 36:32.381
Can you drive us?
Maybe we could skip fifth?

36:34.850 --> 36:36.397
Sure. Yes.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.976
Meet me in the parking lot. Okay?

-Thanks. Thanks, Courtney.
-Yeah.

No, no, no! What are you...

I'm having fun!

-What's up, Foley?
-Hey, Jeff.

37:54.930 --> 37:57.592
Nothing. Just fucking stupid
high school dances.

There's vodka in the red shit if you want.

38:02.780 --> 38:03.769
Nah, I'm good.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.947
I'll be right back.

38:09.990 --> 38:10.979
What happened?

38:12.950 --> 38:13.939
She left.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.826
She just... left.

38:16.920 --> 38:17.955
Why?

38:19.080 --> 38:20.126
'Cause...

38:20.710 --> 38:23.452
'Cause I think she thinks I care
about shit I don't care about.

-I was having a good time.

That's what friends do.

You okay?

38:34.970 --> 38:35.971
Okay.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.186
I really like Justin.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.929
He's nice.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.810
You shouldn't.

38:43.900 --> 38:44.889
He isn't.

in the armrest thing.

-You should eat.
-FIne.

-Okay. Watch your leg.
-Mm-hmm.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.668
[gasps] Oh, my God!

38:59.290 --> 39:00.871
This is amazing.

39:01.290 --> 39:04.953
I fucking love these peanut butter
and cheese crackers,

39:05.130 --> 39:07.712
even though they don't taste
like peanut butter or cheese.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.502
God, you would make
the best soccer mom, dude.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.630
Thank you, Jess.

39:17.060 --> 39:18.880
I'm sorry I slapped you that one time.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.765
That wasn't cool.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.019
[starter clicking]

39:35.450 --> 39:36.326
For fuck's sake.

39:45.710 --> 39:46.950
I'm glad you came to me, Clay.

39:48.460 --> 39:51.839
Look, everyone's been really good
at keeping it secret.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.047
No one's even told their parents.

39:56.390 --> 39:57.379
Uh-huh.

39:59.770 --> 40:01.180
[sniffs] Is that...?

40:01.560 --> 40:02.936
Yeah, that smell is me.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.015
You're really not doing so well.

40:08.070 --> 40:09.059
No.

40:15.660 --> 40:16.820
No, I'm not.

40:20.330 --> 40:21.536
Hey...

40:21.620 --> 40:23.201
it's good to talk to you about this.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.240
Can Ijust...

40:27.670 --> 40:28.955
I want to show you something.

40:31.510 --> 40:32.920
Can I take you there?

40:38.100 --> 40:39.260
[Courtney] There's...

40:39.350 --> 40:40.635
um, there's no headstone.

40:42.890 --> 40:44.437
They take a couple months to make.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.266
So, when someone dies suddenly...

40:55.700 --> 40:57.986
-[Courtney] It's beautiful here.
-[scoffs]

40:58.620 --> 40:59.985
"It's beautiful here"?

41:00.240 --> 41:01.400
I don't know, Clay.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.956
What do you want me to say?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.121
I'm not sure why you brought me here.

41:06.210 --> 41:08.531
Because you've been acting
like Hannah killing herself

41:08.630 --> 41:10.916
was some, like, school activity.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.500
Like just a reason to put posters up.

41:12.590 --> 41:14.251
I'm trying to help the school heal.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.419
The school?

41:15.510 --> 41:16.499
Yeah.

41:16.590 --> 41:17.466
What about you?

41:18.640 --> 41:19.550
Yes, all of us.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.131
So you help the school,
and cover the fact it's your fault too.

41:22.230 --> 41:23.174
It's not my fault.

41:24.730 --> 41:26.721
Clay, look,

41:26.940 --> 41:29.010
I know she was special to you.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.476
And I know you're upset,
and I get it, but...

41:32.110 --> 41:33.646
but this was Hannah's choice.

41:34.150 --> 41:35.981
Okay, this isn't on anyone but her.

41:36.410 --> 41:39.117
No. No, it's on every person
who talked shit about her,

41:39.200 --> 41:40.827
and every guy who fucked her over,

41:40.910 --> 41:43.367
and it's on you because
she thought you were a friend,

41:43.450 --> 41:45.156
and you sent one more asshole
in her direction

41:45.250 --> 41:46.956
just to cover the fact you're gay.

41:47.210 --> 41:48.165
That's not true.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.491
I don't get it, Courtney.
It's the let century.

41:50.590 --> 41:51.659
How is this so hard for you?

41:57.760 --> 41:58.920
Was it hard for you?

41:59.890 --> 42:01.846
Freshman year, when everyone
thought you were gay?

42:03.470 --> 42:05.438
Well, it probably hurt
my chances with girls,

42:05.520 --> 42:07.306
but they weren't so great before,
so whatever.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.265
I didn't lie to anybody about who I was.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.601
-I didn't hurt anyone because of it.
-Neither did I.

42:11.690 --> 42:13.021
We both know you did.

42:13.110 --> 42:15.021
Christ, Courtney, you've got two gay dads!

42:15.110 --> 42:17.021
Yeah, and I have since I was in preschool,

42:17.110 --> 42:18.600
when no one had gay dads.

42:18.700 --> 42:21.112
Do you have any idea what that's like?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.035
Even now.

42:31.790 --> 42:32.996
I mean...

42:34.010 --> 42:35.125
What if I were?

42:37.630 --> 42:39.257
What do you think everyone would say?

42:39.590 --> 42:42.468
"She's got two gay dads,
that's why she's..."

42:43.970 --> 42:46.552
And my dads,
they've taken so much crap,

42:47.060 --> 42:49.767
my whole life, for being gay
and then for being dads,

42:49.850 --> 42:51.056
and Ijust can't...

42:53.690 --> 42:55.180
I couldn't do that to them.

42:58.820 --> 43:01.311
What people think of you isn't
more important than Hannah's life.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.616
She needed you as a friend.

43:05.330 --> 43:06.740
That's what should've mattered to you.

43:07.540 --> 43:10.168
[sniffles] I got scared, okay?

43:10.250 --> 43:11.069
And...

43:11.170 --> 43:13.286
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.206
[sniffs] I'm so sorry.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.370
I'm not the one
who needed to hear that.

43:25.260 --> 43:26.466
[engine starts]

43:27.680 --> 43:29.341
Thanks, Tony. You're a lifesaver.

43:31.850 --> 43:35.229
A dozen people walked past this tragedy
and all averted their eyes.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.684
It's not a problem.

43:38.780 --> 43:41.351
You should have texted me.
I would have come out before I packed up.

43:45.490 --> 43:47.538
I love that you still use cassette tapes.

43:47.870 --> 43:50.077
My parents still sell blank ones
at the store.

43:50.870 --> 43:51.859
I don't know why.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.279
For mix tapes, of course.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.837
A lost and essential art.

43:58.970 --> 43:59.959
What's this?

44:00.260 --> 44:02.330
That starts with the song
you and Clay danced to.

44:02.760 --> 44:03.795
The slow one.

44:08.310 --> 44:09.345
Thank you.

44:10.100 --> 44:11.340
You're welcome.

44:12.690 --> 44:13.645
See you around?

44:13.730 --> 44:15.186
Yeah. Drive safe.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.389
Thank you.

44:32.580 --> 44:35.708
So, why the fuck would Clay
take Courtney to Hannah's grave?

44:35.790 --> 44:37.030
I have no idea.

44:37.130 --> 44:38.495
But if he's doing this now,

44:38.590 --> 44:40.296
what happens when he gets
to the stuff about my party?

44:40.380 --> 44:41.290
Nothing happens, okay?

44:41.380 --> 44:43.120
I'm ending this shit right now.

44:43.550 --> 44:45.336
He doesn't think that Hannah's lying.

44:46.350 --> 44:48.090
He could tell people the wrong things.

44:48.180 --> 44:49.556
He won't.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.009
I'll take care of it.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.055
How?

44:52.940 --> 44:53.929
Justin...

44:54.690 --> 44:56.555
I don't want people to think...

44:58.150 --> 45:00.436
What if people find out
about what Hannah said,

45:00.530 --> 45:02.646
and then everyone starts to think
something happened?

45:02.740 --> 45:04.480
No one's going to think
anything's happened.

45:04.570 --> 45:06.811
No one's going to think or say anything.

45:09.580 --> 45:10.865
Clay's out of control.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.781
I'll get him under control.

45:14.790 --> 45:16.121
He's not gonna hurt you.

45:42.190 --> 45:43.600
I know what you're gonna say.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.110
It's the song you asked about.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.917
The one you and Hannah danced to.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.341
You could have given it to me at school.

46:11.970 --> 46:13.551
Did you pick my lock?

46:14.480 --> 46:16.687
I saw you guys
turn down Cemetery Road...

46:18.310 --> 46:20.187
I didn't think you'd be
getting a ride back.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.099
And I...

46:24.490 --> 46:25.855
think it was time I saw this too.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.776
Since the family didn't have a funeral,

46:30.870 --> 46:33.862
and I didn't feel like coming by myself.

46:38.460 --> 46:40.781
It's not the kind of thing you do
if you're not ready, Clay.

46:43.210 --> 46:44.199
You mean Courtney.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.120
I saw her driving out of here.
She looked...

46:47.470 --> 46:48.505
pretty fucked up.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.101
When I listen to the tapes...

47:08.320 --> 47:09.309
I want to...

47:11.240 --> 47:12.821
see her in school tomorrow.

47:17.910 --> 47:19.366
I want to eat Mike and Ikes

47:19.670 --> 47:21.740
out of the box with her at the Crestmont.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.706
I want to dance with her again, and...

47:27.880 --> 47:29.086
kiss her...

47:30.180 --> 47:31.795
when I should have kissed her.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.517
But I can't.

47:42.350 --> 47:43.977
Don't you feel like someone
should pay for that?

47:45.360 --> 47:46.349
Aren't you?

49:04.770 --> 49:06.306
[horn blaring]

49:13.030 --> 49:15.021
-What the hell? _
-Wanna go for a rIde real qurck?

49:15.110 --> 49:16.065
No.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.359
We think you do.

49:17.450 --> 49:18.769
What the hell, man?

49:19.290 --> 49:20.279
What are you doing?

49:20.620 --> 49:21.860
Get in the car.

49:22.620 --> 49:24.611
Come on, I'll take you home.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.989
Why are you doing this?

49:28.210 --> 49:29.336
What else am I gonna do?

49:30.840 --> 49:32.046
I don't understand.

49:32.130 --> 49:33.540
You will. Just get in the car.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.556
[Mrs Baker]
I understand. Thank you.

49:47.900 --> 49:49.765
Thank you very much for letting us know.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.224
[phone beeps]

49:56.660 --> 49:58.366
We knew it might go to trial.

49:59.490 --> 50:02.698
They've hired Caproni, Burkhardt
and Goodell. It's a big ﬁrm.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.149
I've seen them in the newspapers.

50:05.870 --> 50:08.077
So they're playing to win.
We'll do the same.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.911
They're gonna go after our girl.

50:25.890 --> 50:27.016
What are you guys doing?

50:33.940 --> 50:35.601
[tires screeching]

50:37.990 --> 50:38.979
Yo, Alex.

50:39.070 --> 50:40.230
We know what you did to Courtney.

50:42.830 --> 50:44.400
Jesus, Alex, slow down.

50:48.170 --> 50:50.741
You know, you've really got to stop
fucking with people, Clay.

50:50.830 --> 50:51.876
Just slow down.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.000
[horns blaring]

50:56.090 --> 50:58.172
Okay, I will, I'll stop.
Just slow down.

50:58.260 --> 50:59.386
Alex, slow down!

51:00.470 --> 51:02.040
-I'll stop!
-Okay, okay.

51:02.140 --> 51:03.380
Ease up, we're good.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.380
Alex, I think he gets it. Slow down.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.141
What the hell, dude, slow down!

51:17.240 --> 51:19.356
-[car horn blares]
-[siren]

51:22.200 --> 51:24.691
Oh, shit, Alex.
Alex, seriously, slow the fuck down.

51:24.790 --> 51:25.859
Seriously, Alex.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.420
Ever been to jail before?

51:46.930 --> 51:49.558
Okay, you boys want to tell me
why you're going 90 in a 40?

51:49.640 --> 51:51.050
We were just out for a ride.

51:51.150 --> 51:53.015
-We're sorry, officer.
-Yeah. Well, you know,

51:53.110 --> 51:54.509
I could bust you for reckless driving.

51:54.610 --> 51:56.475
You know how much that ticket would be?

51:57.070 --> 51:59.277
Five hundred dollars_
and three pornts on your license.

51:59.860 --> 52:00.690
You want that?

52:01.240 --> 52:02.229
No, sir.

52:05.910 --> 52:09.198
I suggest you drop these boys off
and get your ass home in time for dinner.

52:09.290 --> 52:12.498
-All right. You be home in time?
-Te|| Mom to save me a plate.

52:12.960 --> 52:16.418
And stick to the speed limit, kid.
'Cause next time, I'll ticket you.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.869
Seat belt.

52:21.550 --> 52:22.539
Night, Dad.

52:28.310 --> 52:29.629
No shit.

52:30.600 --> 52:31.760
Your dad's a cop?

52:32.140 --> 52:32.970
Yep.

52:33.060 --> 52:34.436
[Justin] That's fucking brilliant!

52:35.940 --> 52:37.100
You can't touch us, Clay.

52:37.940 --> 52:38.850
You got that?

52:39.190 --> 52:40.680
We're fucking bulletproof.

52:40.860 --> 52:42.270
[laughs]

52:48.450 --> 52:49.656
Come on, let's go.

52:51.910 --> 52:53.537
["The Night We Met" playing on headphones]

52:53.620 --> 52:58.455
Take me back to the n/ght we met

53:00.960 --> 53:03.337
I don ’t know what I ’m supposed to do

53:03.430 --> 53:05.830
Haunted by the ghost of you

53:07.640 --> 53:12.088
Take me back to the n/ght we met

53:15.190 --> 53:20.560
When the n/ght was full of terror...

53:25.200 --> 53:26.235
[music stops]

53:27.740 --> 53:29.230
What you listening to?

53:30.790 --> 53:32.030
Nothing.

53:32.580 --> 53:34.036
One of Tony's mix tapes.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.371
Is everything okay?

53:38.460 --> 53:39.791
Yeah, yeah, great.

53:46.220 --> 53:47.847
Clay, I need to talk to you.

53:50.100 --> 53:53.479
Do you know anything about any kids
getting bullied at your school?

53:57.100 --> 53:58.681
Why, did someone call you?

53:59.110 --> 54:00.099
No.

54:04.490 --> 54:07.778
I'm asking whether you knew
if Hannah Baker was bullied.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.246
Why Hannah Baker?

54:14.540 --> 54:17.031
My firm was hired today by the school

54:17.120 --> 54:19.668
to defend them in the lawsuit
that the Bakers have filed.

54:20.710 --> 54:23.702
Your firm? Doesn't the school
have their own lavwers?

54:23.920 --> 54:24.750
They do.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.047
But for a lawsuit, they need litigators.

54:27.130 --> 54:28.085
Like me.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.756
You're going up against the Bakers?

54:31.430 --> 54:32.886
Well, I'm defending the school.

54:33.220 --> 54:35.222
But you're a parent
of a kid at the school.

54:35.310 --> 54:38.768
I think that's one reason the partners
asked me to take the case.

54:41.770 --> 54:44.227
So you're going to try to prove
that Hannah wasn't bullied.

54:45.570 --> 54:48.653
The school's position is that they
didn't know about any bullying,

54:49.200 --> 54:50.986
and they would have
stopped it if they had.

54:54.540 --> 54:55.859
You believe that's true?

54:59.170 --> 55:00.660
