[Applause and cheers]

10:14.265 --> 10:15.919
The more I think about it,

10:15.963 --> 10:17.747
the more I feel like that game

10:17.791 --> 10:19.575
kind of sends the wrong message.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.577
Because... it makes it seem
like,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.361
as soon as you find
the right key,

10:23.405 --> 10:25.625
everything's just supposed
to work out, right?

10:25.668 --> 10:29.150
But life is more complicated
than that.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.502
Now, I used to think
that my one special lock

10:33.545 --> 10:35.547

aggressive,

10:35.591 --> 10:38.812
and come from a long line
of Adriatic royalty,

10:39.943 --> 10:42.163
or have a beard,

10:42.206 --> 10:44.382
and be really into the woods.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.297
Then I realized that sometimes,

10:46.341 --> 10:48.691
a special little lock
can come along,

10:48.735 --> 10:50.693
that you didn't think would
fit because it didn't look,

10:50.737 --> 10:53.435
or act, like the lock
you thought you needed.

10:56.612 --> 11:00.311
So instead of actually giving
it a real chance,

11:00.355 --> 11:01.965
you throw it away

11:02.009 --> 11:04.533
because it was too nice.

11:06.361 --> 11:09.320
And it liked you too much,
and cared.

11:11.453 --> 11:14.674
And now that lock
has found another key,

11:15.805 --> 11:18.242
and you are so happy for it,

11:19.679 --> 11:22.899
and you just need to accept
that,

11:22.943 --> 11:25.336

- Aw, it was nothing.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.205
- So, we'd like you to say
hello

20:50.249 --> 20:52.251
to Roland Moira Schitt.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.690
[Johnny chokes
and clears throat]

20:56.733 --> 21:00.824
- Wow, that's... the name is
really something, isn't it?

21:00.868 --> 21:03.262
- And an honour I dream not of!

21:03.305 --> 21:05.002
- Do you wanna hold him, Moira?

21:05.046 --> 21:06.743
- Oh yeah, here you go.
- No, no please.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.310
- Comin' at ya.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.181
- Please, no.
- Here he comes.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.793
Roland Moira Schitt.
- Oh, ha ha.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.276
- Look at that,
the two Moira's.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.756
- Take him, John,
my hands are shaking.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.454
- No, thank you.
