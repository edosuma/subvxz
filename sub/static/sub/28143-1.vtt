00:48.379 --> 00:50.015
Come here.

03:02.448 --> 03:07.119
Gentlemen.
They dance, you choose.

03:08.754 --> 03:10.356
And only one wins.

03:11.623 --> 03:14.525
Please give a final welcome

03:14.527 --> 03:18.932
to Jenny, Tia, and Kris.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.185
Really?

04:20.058 --> 04:22.960
There's, uh...
Thank you, ladies.

04:22.962 --> 04:26.063
Now I got something else
for you, gentlemen.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.201
I'm gonna make it
happen for you tonight.

04:33.205 --> 04:36.075
DJ, one more song.

04:37.041 --> 04:38.477
What the fuck?

05:37.101 --> 05:39.102
What the fuck.

07:04.123 --> 07:05.224
Hey.

07:13.364 --> 07:14.766
How much did he give you?

07:15.834 --> 07:17.236
$250.

07:18.102 --> 07:19.472
Bullshit.

07:27.712 --> 07:29.278
You motherfucker.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.347
You owe that girl
some money.

07:31.349 --> 07:33.049
First, lower your voice.

07:33.051 --> 07:34.950
Second, I don't
owe her shit.

07:34.952 --> 07:36.986
She's lucky
she's got that much.

07:36.988 --> 07:38.789
$500, Sisco.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.289
That was the deal. $500.

07:40.291 --> 07:42.195
You fucking work for me!

07:42.794 --> 07:44.330
Not the other way around.

07:45.697 --> 07:48.935
Baby, I'm gonna make this divorce
very simple for all of us.

07:50.068 --> 07:51.437
We're out.

07:52.203 --> 07:53.939
Time to find some new gigs.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.709
- Ladies?
- Bye.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.685
Wait, wait, wait.

08:06.118 --> 08:07.286
Kiss?

08:09.654 --> 08:10.756
Please.

08:11.957 --> 08:13.291
What do you want?

08:15.626 --> 08:19.095
I want you to fix the squeaky
doors in the dressing room.

08:19.097 --> 08:21.498
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Am I?

08:21.500 --> 08:23.532
And the light bulbs,
they don't even work.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.904
We have to do our makeup
in the dark, Sisco.

08:27.839 --> 08:28.940
Anything else?

08:31.876 --> 08:33.010
What's your name again?

08:34.178 --> 08:35.548
Tia.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.583
Do you wanna make
some money tonight?

08:40.885 --> 08:42.451
She joins us on stage.

08:42.453 --> 08:44.153
- On stage?
- On stage.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.022
- Fuck no.
- Fuck you.

08:46.024 --> 08:47.657
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

08:47.659 --> 08:49.459
Everybody in there
is there to see us.

08:49.461 --> 08:50.730
They're not here to see you.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.729
Sisco, you're not
treating 'em right.

08:53.731 --> 08:56.700
This is some bullshit,
and we are out.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.671
<i>You don't have
anything without us.</i>

08:59.704 --> 09:01.537
<i>She fucking
works for me, not for you.</i>

09:01.539 --> 09:03.773
<i>She does not work for you.
You don't even pay her.</i>

09:03.775 --> 09:06.209
<i>If I leave,
the girls are leaving.</i>

09:06.211 --> 09:07.878
<i>This is
my fucking place.</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:09.881
<i>I don't
really work for you.</i>

09:12.451 --> 09:14.316
<i>You guys have
to remember...</i>

09:14.318 --> 09:15.585
<i>Remember Vegas?</i>

09:18.624 --> 09:20.690
<i>We don't
talk about Vegas anymore.</i>

09:20.692 --> 09:24.060
<i>But for now, let's go get
food, and the white stuff.</i>

09:24.062 --> 09:25.729
<i>You wanna roll with us?</i>

09:25.731 --> 09:29.302
<i>So how do you feel?
You got cash in your pocket.</i>

09:30.334 --> 09:31.835
Yeah. Thank you so much.

09:31.837 --> 09:35.238
- You killed it.
- Girl, we made our rent tonight.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.373
Good. And then some.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.807
We had a good day.

09:38.809 --> 09:40.210
It was a good-ass night.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.979
This guy tipped me
with a gift certificate.

09:42.981 --> 09:44.781
Okay, let me look at that.

09:44.783 --> 09:46.818
- It's a little strange.
- It is really strange.

09:47.919 --> 09:49.286
A wine tasting?

09:49.288 --> 09:51.620
I don't know.
That looks sketch.

09:51.622 --> 09:53.422
Okay, $500, though.

09:53.424 --> 09:55.524
Safaris. Yes.

09:55.526 --> 09:58.460
Lions and tigers and llamas.

09:58.462 --> 10:00.463
- Llamas?
- Yeah, let's do it.

10:00.465 --> 10:01.965
- Llamas?
- Let's do it.

10:01.967 --> 10:04.167
Let's get some food
and let's roll out.

10:04.169 --> 10:05.438
- You going?
- You wanna come?

10:07.172 --> 10:09.906
Yes. It's my gift certificate.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.075
- Oops.
- She bites.

10:12.077 --> 10:13.412
Let's do it.

10:30.861 --> 10:31.827
We're here.

10:31.829 --> 10:33.596
Before noon,
trying to get drunk.

10:33.598 --> 10:35.467
The fuck outta here.

10:35.933 --> 10:37.035
Look at this.

10:46.377 --> 10:47.710
That one's so true.

10:47.712 --> 10:49.946
So, what does that say, ladies?

10:49.948 --> 10:52.248
W-I-N-E spells...

10:52.250 --> 10:55.051
- Let's get drunk.
- Wine!

10:55.053 --> 10:57.088
I'll have a rose wine.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.027
What's up, beauty?
What's wrong?

11:06.765 --> 11:08.034
Uh...

11:09.867 --> 11:12.268
I just don't know
about what I'm wearing.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.404
- I think you look great.
- First of all, you're wearing my clothes.

11:15.406 --> 11:18.742
Second of all,
I think I dress pretty fly.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.976
And you look great,
so let's go.

11:20.978 --> 11:23.312
Once we have wine,
no one cares.

11:23.314 --> 11:24.983
Wine awaits us, girl. Come on.

11:32.457 --> 11:34.023
- What's up, ladies?
- Hi.

11:34.025 --> 11:36.325
Welcome to Black Horse
Wines and Wild Animal Park.

11:36.327 --> 11:37.762
What are we drinking today?

11:40.198 --> 11:42.635
- What does this get us?
- Let me check that out.

11:44.369 --> 11:47.671
I've never seen one of these.
Let me check with my manager.

11:52.244 --> 11:54.511
Hey, ladies, I'm sorry,
but I've got some bad news.

11:54.513 --> 11:57.213
Um, I don't know where
you got this, but I'm sorry.

11:57.215 --> 11:58.514
This thing's fake as fuck.

11:58.516 --> 12:01.484
Okay, I knew
this shit was fake.

12:01.486 --> 12:03.253
- We're still gonna drink, though.
- Let's drink.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.687
Just kidding.

12:04.689 --> 12:07.891
Pretty generous for somebody,
a $500 gift certificate.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.392
You're a jokester.

12:09.394 --> 12:11.960
So let's start you out
with the house favorite.

12:11.962 --> 12:15.065
2008 Black Horse Cab.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.966
You may get ol' cinnamon
nutmeg on the nose.

12:17.968 --> 12:19.037
What's your name?

12:20.105 --> 12:22.172
Gibson. Who are you?

12:22.174 --> 12:24.476
- Kiss.
- Nice to meet you, Kiss.

12:26.645 --> 12:27.911
I'll take some, too. Thank you.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.946
Guys, I'm gonna take care
of everybody, all right?

12:29.948 --> 12:31.214
We like that.

12:31.216 --> 12:32.382
There you go.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.686
I like this.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.652
Let's go
through the four S's.

12:36.654 --> 12:38.524
We're gonna swirl,

12:39.957 --> 12:42.892
smell, sip...

12:42.894 --> 12:44.063
Sip.

12:45.263 --> 12:46.830
...and spit.

12:46.832 --> 12:47.763
Spit?

12:47.765 --> 12:49.065
You know, that's funny.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.133
We don't spit.

12:50.135 --> 12:51.301
Doesn't make you
a bad girl.

12:52.370 --> 12:54.070
So, what does
the $500 get us?

12:54.072 --> 12:55.174
Rico.

12:56.707 --> 12:57.606
Hi.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.542
It's a wild park.

12:59.544 --> 13:02.912
We got antelope,
zebra, camel.

13:02.914 --> 13:04.547
Can we ride them?

13:04.549 --> 13:06.449
Of course, you want to.

13:06.451 --> 13:07.683
What about this?

13:07.685 --> 13:10.552
Let's slam these two bottles
as fast as we can.

13:10.554 --> 13:12.522
That sounds like a good plan.

13:13.759 --> 13:16.493
It's go time.
Welcome to Black Horse Wines...

13:16.495 --> 13:18.764
...and
Wild Animal Park.

13:30.909 --> 13:33.475
Ladies, here's our
number one tour guide.

13:33.477 --> 13:35.011
This is my boy, Casey.

13:35.013 --> 13:38.447
He enjoys long walks on the
beach, sea food and puppies.

13:38.449 --> 13:40.550
Not at all.

13:40.552 --> 13:42.451
You guys ready for
a good tour or what?

13:42.453 --> 13:44.220
- Yeah.
- Are you coming up?

13:44.222 --> 13:45.220
I got you.

13:45.222 --> 13:46.224
All right. Let's go.

13:57.334 --> 13:58.770
So that's where
we prep them.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.352
Yeah!

15:26.790 --> 15:29.425
All right, ladies,
besides exotic animals,

15:29.427 --> 15:31.594
we do house a lot of horses.

15:31.596 --> 15:33.796
Some are world champions.

15:33.798 --> 15:36.666
When they get injured,
we nurse them back to health.

15:36.668 --> 15:38.301
They're real fighters.

15:41.039 --> 15:43.138
We have a little hay
if you guys want to feed them.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.407
Hey, girl, hay.

15:47.678 --> 15:50.015
We keep the ferocious
kind in here.

15:51.415 --> 15:52.885
Hello, baby.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.256
I think
he might need some hay.

15:58.957 --> 16:00.889
Eric's a good kid.

16:00.891 --> 16:02.861
He's 14 years old.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.729
Eric,
you want some more?

16:06.731 --> 16:08.196
You ladies hungry?

16:08.198 --> 16:10.066
Come on, I know a place where
we can get some great food.

16:10.068 --> 16:11.768
- You don't need it.
- It doesn't affect us.

16:11.770 --> 16:12.902
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

16:12.904 --> 16:14.237
I've already told you this.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.272
This is one thing
you could do, but...

16:16.274 --> 16:17.473
Don't fucking take it.

16:17.475 --> 16:19.879
Don't. Don't fucking take it.

16:23.648 --> 16:25.750
Fucking serious.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.220
Fucking bitch.

16:41.799 --> 16:45.203
- Girl!
- I know. Where are we?

16:47.706 --> 16:50.540
This is just
my secret hideaway.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.807
Come on, girls.

16:51.809 --> 16:54.277
- We know that it's not.
- Okay.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.946
- Oh, it's so cute.
- Nice.

16:56.948 --> 16:58.380
Where's the wine?

16:58.382 --> 17:00.018
Give me some red.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.319
So the pets, right?

17:06.290 --> 17:08.957
So, okay, so if somebody's
gonna give you a nickname,

17:08.959 --> 17:11.828
this is a good question,
what would it be?

17:11.829 --> 17:13.529
Charles Manson.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.231
- What?
- Just kidding.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.432
Where's my phone?

17:16.434 --> 17:18.166
Okay.

17:18.169 --> 17:20.469
He's not
a bad guy. Don't judge.

17:20.471 --> 17:22.570
Okay. All right.

17:22.573 --> 17:25.040
So this is, like,
the underground hangout?

17:25.042 --> 17:26.675
This is
like a dream come true.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.444
It is like a dream come true.

17:28.445 --> 17:29.848
It's pretty dope.

17:30.348 --> 17:32.184
Well, excuse me.

17:38.823 --> 17:40.359
Where you from?
What do you do?

17:41.392 --> 17:42.894
Um...

17:43.328 --> 17:45.798
I do fun stuff.

17:47.966 --> 17:50.099
- What's up with them wings?
- Cheers.

17:53.438 --> 17:54.736
Too much to drink.

17:54.738 --> 17:56.007
Again?

17:56.908 --> 17:58.409
Never too much.

17:59.777 --> 18:02.378
Why do you do this
to yourself?

18:02.380 --> 18:04.781
What am I doing?
I'm being my fucking self.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.416
What do you mean you're
being your fucking self?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.618
You don't have to fucking drink
and do this shit every fucking day.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.719
This is what the fuck I do.

18:10.721 --> 18:12.221
- If we saw a penguin.
- Yes.

18:12.223 --> 18:14.493
- Camel, giraffe, zebra.
- Zebra.

18:19.197 --> 18:20.830
You're gonna do
this fucking shit?

18:20.832 --> 18:24.399
You're gonna do this fucking shit
for what we have? Are you serious?

18:24.401 --> 18:26.535
You don't appreciate
who the fuck I am now?

18:26.537 --> 18:29.571
Do you know what I just said
that you were the only reason...

18:29.573 --> 18:30.939
Listen to me.

18:49.893 --> 18:51.093
- Hey.
- Hello there.

18:51.095 --> 18:53.896
- Who's back in the party?
- I need a drink.

18:53.898 --> 18:55.598
You don't have
to tell me twice.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.901
Thank you.

18:58.836 --> 19:01.503
- There you go.
- Thank you.

19:01.505 --> 19:03.705
It looks like you might
need a little more.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.244
Hey, hold down the fort.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.883
- What's up? Good.
- I'm better now.

19:24.161 --> 19:25.329
Hi.

19:26.397 --> 19:27.633
How are you?

19:30.935 --> 19:32.337
I'm good.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.573
- You good?
- Mm.

19:42.013 --> 19:43.682
Parties hard, huh?

19:45.717 --> 19:48.251
- Treasure.
- What?

19:48.253 --> 19:51.356
- Girl.
- Come on. What the fuck?

19:52.724 --> 19:54.293
You want any?

20:36.801 --> 20:39.601
So this is your day job?

20:39.603 --> 20:41.870
You have girls come in here

20:41.872 --> 20:43.609
and you get them drunk.

20:44.942 --> 20:46.444
Is that what you do?

20:47.312 --> 20:49.078
I wouldn't say it like that.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.480
- You drank the whole vineyard.
- The fuck is this?

20:51.482 --> 20:53.014
- I drank the whole vineyard?
- Yes.

20:53.016 --> 20:56.017
You drank some.
You definitely drank some.

20:56.019 --> 20:57.285
You drank some.

20:57.287 --> 20:59.288
You might need
to miss some.

20:59.290 --> 21:00.723
- Take a break.
- You had some.

21:00.725 --> 21:02.491
- Chill out. I got it.
- You had some.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.994
We all had some.
I'm not the only one.

21:04.996 --> 21:06.732
- I'm not the only one.
- I got it.

21:10.668 --> 21:12.004
Treasure.

21:12.603 --> 21:13.936
What the fuck?

21:13.938 --> 21:17.008
I come out here and you're kissing
some fucking dick? Come on.

21:17.408 --> 21:19.111
Let's chill.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.244
Chill? Me, chill?

21:21.246 --> 21:23.612
Where's the bottle
of fucking wine, Houdini?

21:23.614 --> 21:26.514
I'm glad you asked
that question, Treasure.

21:26.516 --> 21:27.984
My god.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.186
Been saving this
for a special occasion.

21:30.188 --> 21:31.419
I think it's tonight.

21:31.421 --> 21:34.023
I've got a special
bottle here.

21:34.025 --> 21:37.092
Straight from Afghanistan.
Aged 25 years.

21:37.094 --> 21:39.395
Perfect. Make mine
a double, please.

21:39.397 --> 21:40.599
Will do.

21:41.064 --> 21:42.365
Some for you.

21:42.367 --> 21:43.965
So they have vineyards
in Afghanistan?

21:43.967 --> 21:45.370
Vineyards?

21:52.543 --> 21:55.110
Don't forget, ladies.

21:55.112 --> 21:57.082
- Swirl...
- Some for you.

21:58.349 --> 22:00.782
- Some for you?
- Swirl and sniff.

22:00.784 --> 22:02.051
I would love some.

22:02.053 --> 22:03.722
Awesome. That's my girl.

22:05.857 --> 22:07.657
Oh, no!

22:08.860 --> 22:11.627
Ladies, looks like
we got shut out.

22:11.629 --> 22:13.596
You know I always come
with some extra treats.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.865
That's why you're
the best in the business.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.466
You've been fucking
hiding this the whole time?

22:18.468 --> 22:20.503
I didn't even feel it there.
What is it?

22:20.505 --> 22:21.739
You can take this.

22:24.309 --> 22:26.678
Better be some
strong-ass shit.

22:28.545 --> 22:31.147
Give me a hit
of that, South Beach.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.249
- You like it?
- Yup.

22:33.251 --> 22:36.288
We need to have a toast.
Everybody on your feet.

22:39.357 --> 22:42.824
Now I don't know what
planet you ladies came from,

22:42.826 --> 22:45.026
but it's gotta be damn sexy.

22:47.064 --> 22:48.699
Here's to friendship.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.167
Oh, wait. Wait, wait.

22:52.637 --> 22:56.738
I would like to induct
our newest member

22:56.740 --> 22:58.674
to our tribe.

22:58.676 --> 23:00.379
Our beauty, Promise.

23:01.879 --> 23:06.448
And just remember,
fortune always follows the sexy.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.516
- True that.
- To the tribe.

23:08.518 --> 23:10.721
- To the tribe.
- Let's cheers.

23:15.192 --> 23:17.193
So, uh, this is
from Afghanistan?

23:17.195 --> 23:18.563
Sure is.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.196
Tasty.

23:21.198 --> 23:22.898
It's really different.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.468
Different grapes.

23:28.339 --> 23:29.705
Let me try that one.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.940
You wanted whiskey,
you got whiskey.

23:31.942 --> 23:34.843
No, I'm gonna have wine too.
I'm a fucking guest here.

23:34.845 --> 23:36.212
Give it to me also.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.646
You wanna mix
your pleasures, Treasure.

23:37.648 --> 23:39.814
I can do
what I want. I'm a big girl.

23:39.816 --> 23:41.516
This time, I want everything.

23:41.518 --> 23:44.520
- You're just...
- Give me the fucking glass. Fuck you.

23:44.522 --> 23:46.088
- Sit down.
- Oh, really? Fuck me?

23:55.365 --> 23:57.299
She's not even good.

23:57.301 --> 23:59.334
You can never just
have a conversation with me.

23:59.336 --> 24:01.070
What the fuck is going on?

24:01.072 --> 24:03.574
What you were doing in there
didn't fucking hurt me.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.726
Good morning, Kiss.

25:31.461 --> 25:34.530
No, no, no.
Don't strain your voice.

25:34.532 --> 25:36.999
It'll be a minute
before it comes back.

25:37.001 --> 25:38.603
You're paralyzed.

25:39.336 --> 25:41.372
That was some strong wine.

25:41.938 --> 25:44.340
One Last Kiss, dangerous.

25:45.976 --> 25:47.475
Seriously, Gibson.

25:47.477 --> 25:49.278
You're still using that shit?

25:49.280 --> 25:51.112
Yes, I am, General.

25:51.114 --> 25:54.315
I stockpiled it
before you blew it up.

25:54.317 --> 25:57.218
Is this torture
your idea of amusement?

25:57.220 --> 25:58.753
Oh, come on, Senator.

25:58.755 --> 26:01.357
This is all just
a little foreplay.

26:01.359 --> 26:05.426
Ladies, we're all
your biggest fans.

26:05.428 --> 26:07.362
And those of us who aren't,

26:07.364 --> 26:09.700
in 48 hours will be.

26:11.235 --> 26:13.601
Now, some of you,

26:13.603 --> 26:16.571
eventually all of you,
are gonna fight.

26:16.573 --> 26:19.474
You're gonna kick
some ass for us.

26:19.476 --> 26:21.744
Now I'm not gonna
sugarcoat this shit.

26:21.746 --> 26:25.316
I'm gonna bet some of you won't
make it through this alive.

26:26.016 --> 26:27.486
Now don't worry.

26:28.084 --> 26:30.485
- Rico!
- Yes, sir.

26:30.487 --> 26:32.655
Give the girls
one click each.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.793
Just enough so they
can eat their dinner.

27:08.258 --> 27:12.429
Ladies, command,
eat your dinner.

27:21.171 --> 27:24.005
Well, holy fucking shit.

27:24.007 --> 27:25.707
Impressed now, Senator?

27:25.709 --> 27:27.609
Taking an order to eat steak

27:27.611 --> 27:31.045
is different from ordering
a man to kill someone.

27:31.047 --> 27:35.583
I still don't know why on earth we
aren't using men to experiment on.

27:35.585 --> 27:38.419
If I can take
a group of women

27:38.421 --> 27:40.990
and turn them into
cold-blooded killers,

27:40.992 --> 27:43.995
imagine what a seasoned
veteran will do.

27:46.063 --> 27:47.565
We'll see.

27:54.505 --> 27:56.938
Ha-ha! All right, ladies.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.907
These are gonna be your VIP
rooms for the next few nights.

27:59.909 --> 28:02.110
I call this a little
slice of heaven.

28:02.112 --> 28:04.946
Got spacious areas,
good air.

28:04.948 --> 28:06.615
Healthy for you.

28:06.617 --> 28:08.384
Way to take one
for the team.

28:08.386 --> 28:09.717
Shit knocked me out.

28:09.719 --> 28:12.221
That's what it does.
How are our guests?

28:12.223 --> 28:13.621
Pumped and ready
for action, Chief.

28:13.623 --> 28:14.990
Excellent, excellent.

28:17.027 --> 28:18.961
That's the beast.

28:18.963 --> 28:21.933
A special subject
for special circumstances.

28:25.069 --> 28:28.436
Ladies, meet your neighbors.

28:28.438 --> 28:30.874
This is Fortune and Dream.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.547
Girls, don't be rude.
Say hello to your new friends.

28:39.582 --> 28:42.454
Command. Follow me.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.821
Ladies, this way.

28:46.823 --> 28:48.823
I've got a special
treat for you.

28:48.825 --> 28:51.161
And here's my
world-class makeup room.

28:55.265 --> 28:57.032
Check this out.

28:57.034 --> 28:59.667
State-of-the-art gym.

28:59.669 --> 29:02.303
That's right.
Don't all thank me at once.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.572
Come on in, come on in.

29:04.574 --> 29:06.608
That's it.
Don't get too excited.

29:06.610 --> 29:08.910
State-of-the-art
makeup station.

29:11.148 --> 29:12.781
Beautiful, beautiful.

29:12.783 --> 29:16.918
Ladies, why don't we get
you ready for the big show?

29:16.920 --> 29:19.957
Rico's gonna show you what you
girls are gonna be wearing.

29:21.391 --> 29:25.229
Command, turn around.

29:28.466 --> 29:29.767
Undress.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.971
Perfect warriors,
just what I wanted.

29:35.973 --> 29:37.939
Get 'em dressed.
Get 'em working out.

29:37.941 --> 29:40.375
Get the makeup on,
and let them rock n' roll.

29:40.377 --> 29:41.713
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

29:46.283 --> 29:48.516
Command, ladies.

29:48.518 --> 29:50.954
Shadow team, weight room.

29:52.323 --> 29:55.357
I need you to work
every muscle.

29:55.359 --> 29:57.059
Move! Go!

29:57.061 --> 29:59.063
Go! Go! Go!

30:46.843 --> 30:47.842
Command!

30:47.844 --> 30:50.411
Get in a straight line,
right behind the others.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.715
Go, go!

30:58.555 --> 31:00.088
Command.

31:00.090 --> 31:01.523
Jog forward.

31:01.525 --> 31:04.161
Outside, to the middle
of the pit.

31:06.296 --> 31:07.332
Let's roll out.

31:16.372 --> 31:19.640
Oh, I hope this isn't another
colossal waste of my time.

31:19.642 --> 31:21.176
Just give him some time.

31:21.178 --> 31:22.246
Look. See, look.

31:23.013 --> 31:24.082
Master showman.

31:35.426 --> 31:36.792
Command.

31:36.794 --> 31:40.665
Ghost team on my right.
Shadow team on my left. Fall in.

31:54.011 --> 31:57.682
I introduce to you,
you and your teammate for the weekend.

31:58.114 --> 31:59.615
Ghost team!

31:59.617 --> 32:03.121
Tia, Fortune, Dream.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.986
Shadow team!

32:04.988 --> 32:08.590
Treasure, Kiss and Kurious.

32:08.592 --> 32:11.894
Six fighters, two teams,
two nights,

32:11.896 --> 32:13.594
but only one winner.

32:13.596 --> 32:15.397
This is a fight
to the death.

32:15.399 --> 32:17.165
Kill or be killed.

32:17.167 --> 32:18.937
Let the dance begin!

32:23.573 --> 32:25.442
I think he should just
get on with it.

32:26.709 --> 32:28.178
There you go.

32:31.782 --> 32:33.784
Single file
against the gate.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.125
Cuff them.

32:42.726 --> 32:43.995
Arm up.

32:47.497 --> 32:48.932
Arms up.

33:07.217 --> 33:08.785
Hello, hello, hello.

33:09.453 --> 33:10.985
How are we doing tonight?

33:10.987 --> 33:12.853
Just fine, Captain.
How are you?

33:12.855 --> 33:14.791
- Can you get the show on the road?
- So sweet.

33:15.092 --> 33:16.058
Heads up.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.996
You know better than that.
Shame on you.

33:20.630 --> 33:21.730
Do I know how to
pick 'em or what?

33:21.732 --> 33:23.865
Well, that's your gift.

33:23.867 --> 33:26.734
He's always had a knack
for choosing good stock.

33:26.736 --> 33:29.006
Will they actually
take the command and fight?

33:30.306 --> 33:33.542
In 48 hours, we're gonna
make up for the last six years

33:33.544 --> 33:35.142
since we pulled out
of Afghanistan.

33:35.144 --> 33:36.610
We're gonna finish
what we started

33:36.612 --> 33:38.746
with a small poppy flower
in the desert.

33:38.748 --> 33:40.351
Senator, will you
do the honors?

33:47.791 --> 33:50.328
Kiss, Dream.

33:50.794 --> 33:52.159
Excellent.

33:52.161 --> 33:53.794
$1,000 on Kiss.

33:53.796 --> 33:55.296
Grow up, boys.

33:55.298 --> 33:57.499
This isn't a sport,
this is women.

33:57.501 --> 34:00.071
I'll take that bet.

34:02.473 --> 34:03.875
Rico?

34:04.742 --> 34:05.909
Kiss versus Dream.

34:06.509 --> 34:07.978
Copy that, Chief.

34:39.409 --> 34:42.313
Command. Follow me.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.596
All right, all right, all right.

35:00.664 --> 35:01.966
Looks promising.

35:09.773 --> 35:12.043
Command. Duel.

36:12.302 --> 36:15.504
No combat training,
no martial arts?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.805
Not these two.

36:21.211 --> 36:22.613
Jesus Christ.

37:08.892 --> 37:12.026
The serum brings out
pure primal instincts.

37:12.028 --> 37:14.331
The limits? Endless.

37:35.318 --> 37:36.686
Whoa!

38:30.039 --> 38:32.140
Literally, I've never
seen that before.

38:51.927 --> 38:53.528
Did you see that?

38:53.530 --> 38:57.231
Boom! Kiss just
stompin' on that Dream.

38:57.233 --> 39:00.602
Kiss, baby,
she is a Dream-killer.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.102
I think that's it.
Broke her neck.

39:02.104 --> 39:04.738
Oh, damn, Captain.

39:04.740 --> 39:08.475
All I saw was one woman
beating another woman to death.

39:08.477 --> 39:10.778
Is this what you dragged
me from DC for?

39:10.780 --> 39:12.148
Wait for it.

39:12.749 --> 39:14.416
Double or nothing?

39:14.418 --> 39:17.220
I pick winners, baby.
Bring it.

39:40.876 --> 39:42.380
Your turn, General.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.352
Treasure and Fortune.

39:50.354 --> 39:52.723
Ooh, that's an
interesting choice.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.224
I can't tell you
who has the advantage.

39:56.226 --> 39:58.026
Come on, not even
a little hint?

39:58.028 --> 39:59.863
You're a child, General.

40:00.930 --> 40:02.430
<i>Rico.</i>

40:02.432 --> 40:04.502
<i>Treasure versus Fortune.</i>

40:11.173 --> 40:12.776
Let go of me.

40:23.887 --> 40:25.285
The fuck is wrong
with her?

40:25.287 --> 40:27.425
<i>Yo, Gibson, come here.</i>

40:30.894 --> 40:32.260
<i>What's the problem?</i>

40:32.262 --> 40:33.660
It's Treasure.

40:33.662 --> 40:35.532
You sure you don't want me
to give her another dose?

40:38.901 --> 40:40.934
<i>Everyone has the same two
clicks for the first round, Rico.</i>

40:40.936 --> 40:42.102
<i>No exceptions.</i>

40:42.104 --> 40:43.541
Okay.

40:59.923 --> 41:01.055
You good?

41:01.057 --> 41:02.756
The bitch just broke my nose!

41:02.758 --> 41:04.225
Get out of here, man! Go!

41:04.227 --> 41:06.397
Command. Run to
the middle of the pit.

41:11.133 --> 41:12.436
Fuck!

41:37.626 --> 41:38.795
Command.

41:39.963 --> 41:40.997
Shit.

41:49.305 --> 41:51.071
Hey, she didn't wait
for the command.

41:51.073 --> 41:52.309
Fuck.

42:25.941 --> 42:28.175
Something we don't know about?

42:28.177 --> 42:31.479
Treasure does have a little
bit of a boxing background.

42:31.481 --> 42:33.180
Not a pro or anything,

42:33.182 --> 42:35.416
but she knows how to throw
a punch or two.

42:35.418 --> 42:37.318
I'm not complaining.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.722
That's my horse.

42:47.731 --> 42:48.765
Kiss.

43:06.282 --> 43:07.515
This is too much.

43:07.517 --> 43:09.383
You can close your eyes
if you want.

43:20.162 --> 43:22.398
Holy shit. This is graphic.

44:27.530 --> 44:28.798
God.

44:47.784 --> 44:50.184
It's another
win for my team, Senator.

44:50.186 --> 44:51.988
Is she supposed
to be doing that?

44:53.222 --> 44:54.955
This is warfare.

44:54.957 --> 44:58.258
You want soldiers
to kill without guilt.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.461
This is the perfect
fighting machine.

45:00.463 --> 45:02.329
The serum works.

45:02.331 --> 45:05.566
I'm not looking for senseless,
brutal murderers in our military.

45:05.568 --> 45:09.403
We have enough of that bullshit going
on within our troops without the serum.

45:09.405 --> 45:10.470
Hey.

45:15.177 --> 45:18.345
Uh, Rico?
I think she's dead.

45:18.347 --> 45:20.180
Can you clean that
shit up, quick?

45:20.182 --> 45:21.515
Kids.

45:21.517 --> 45:22.785
<i>Copy that, Chief.</i>

45:37.534 --> 45:39.669
Promise, can you hear me?

45:41.470 --> 45:43.239
Whatever they gave us,

45:44.039 --> 45:45.575
it's wearing off.

45:47.376 --> 45:49.479
And I think it's
gonna get worse.

46:03.492 --> 46:05.061
You have a good time, Senator?

46:05.595 --> 46:07.394
Actually, no.

46:07.396 --> 46:09.696
You have poor taste.

46:09.698 --> 46:11.599
You're far from my
vote of confidence,

46:11.601 --> 46:13.169
and my checkbook.

46:14.369 --> 46:16.037
Keep trying.

46:16.039 --> 46:17.140
Work with me.

46:22.077 --> 46:23.477
Quick, quick, quick.

46:23.479 --> 46:24.644
I got her.

46:26.816 --> 46:27.951
Shit.

46:36.159 --> 46:37.193
Treasure?

46:38.927 --> 46:40.163
Treasure.

46:43.166 --> 46:44.635
Good God.

46:45.068 --> 46:46.070
Brutal.

46:46.503 --> 46:48.169
It's just brutal.

46:48.171 --> 46:51.041
That girl, you're gonna have
to watch out for.

46:52.608 --> 46:54.207
You're starting
to get it, General.

46:54.209 --> 46:58.979
Imagine a special forces SEAL under
the same serum, same training.

46:58.981 --> 47:01.948
Even an 18-year-old
marine, devastating.

47:01.950 --> 47:05.887
You need both of our votes for
this little enterprise to work.

47:05.889 --> 47:10.258
That's $4,000
my way, Gibson. Who's next?

47:10.260 --> 47:12.863
General, how about you
be the all-time picker?

47:17.166 --> 47:20.069
Kurious and Tia.

47:21.838 --> 47:23.006
Tia.

47:23.740 --> 47:26.173
Is there a problem?

47:26.175 --> 47:29.579
I had her saved
for something special tomorrow.

47:30.680 --> 47:34.284
But maybe it's time
to let that idea go.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.720
Rico.

47:39.722 --> 47:41.624
<i>Kurious versus Tia.</i>

47:42.724 --> 47:44.191
You're up next.

47:44.193 --> 47:45.161
Let's go.

47:47.564 --> 47:48.629
Stop.

47:48.631 --> 47:50.765
Command. Sit down.

47:50.767 --> 47:52.600
- Stop!
- I said sit down!

47:52.602 --> 47:54.001
Do it now!

47:54.003 --> 47:55.035
Stop!

47:55.037 --> 47:56.072
Give it to her.

48:00.443 --> 48:03.244
Down, girl! Down!

48:03.246 --> 48:04.445
You okay?

48:04.447 --> 48:05.983
- You all right?
- Shit, man.

48:06.916 --> 48:09.850
This shit's getting
out of hand, man.

48:09.852 --> 48:12.356
Hey, boss, uh,
I think we need a wardrobe change.

48:15.390 --> 48:16.793
Copy that.

48:19.128 --> 48:22.229
Looks like that wraps up
tonight's festivities.

48:22.231 --> 48:23.798
Things not going to plan?

48:23.800 --> 48:26.499
Nope, girls just need
a bathroom break.

48:26.501 --> 48:30.840
I suggest you get in the game and try
to win some money from the general.

48:31.608 --> 48:34.010
I got 4,000 in the kitty.

48:34.776 --> 48:36.443
Handle your business, Captain.

48:36.445 --> 48:37.814
Thank you.

48:38.814 --> 48:42.048
Enjoy the pool,
jacuzzi and the bar.

48:42.050 --> 48:44.619
We'll come back here
at 2100 hours.

48:44.621 --> 48:48.090
And at that point,
you can decide how much you wanna pay me

48:48.557 --> 48:49.927
for the serum.

48:50.492 --> 48:52.026
Don't waste my time.

48:52.028 --> 48:53.760
I didn't come here
to watch cockfights.

48:53.762 --> 48:55.762
I came here for results.

48:55.764 --> 48:58.599
And you'll get those
results in 24 hours.

48:58.601 --> 48:59.936
Have a little faith.

49:03.606 --> 49:05.872
He's your boy. Sort him out.

49:05.874 --> 49:08.878
If I recall,
this was your idea.

49:13.983 --> 49:16.249
Goddamn it, Rico!

49:16.251 --> 49:18.184
A wardrobe change?

49:18.186 --> 49:20.887
This isn't
a fucking beauty pageant!

49:20.889 --> 49:22.391
What the fuck happened
to your nose?

49:23.860 --> 49:25.626
One of the horses got loose.

49:25.628 --> 49:27.361
Fucking bitches be crazy.

49:27.363 --> 49:29.466
Fuck you.

49:33.302 --> 49:36.336
One click an hour.

49:36.338 --> 49:39.506
That's the fucking dosage.

49:39.508 --> 49:44.113
Chief, everyone except Kurious and Promise has
had exactly two clicks from the beginning.

49:47.450 --> 49:49.015
Two clicks?

49:49.017 --> 49:52.352
'Cause that looks like
you gave her fucking four!

49:52.354 --> 49:54.023
Only two, Chief. One an hour.

49:56.025 --> 49:58.626
Are you trying to fuck me
on this thing, Rico?

49:58.628 --> 49:59.963
No, Chief.

50:01.097 --> 50:03.164
- And Kiss?
- After the fight,

50:03.166 --> 50:05.302
she bottomed out.
I mean, fast.

50:06.369 --> 50:11.941
Can we just keep it together
for 48 fucking hours?

50:12.508 --> 50:13.944
God!

50:17.680 --> 50:20.183
Fuck it. We're done.
Clean it up.

50:21.316 --> 50:22.519
What about Kiss?

50:23.552 --> 50:25.151
Fuck her.

50:25.153 --> 50:27.787
If she crashes, I'll just tell them
her girlfriend fucking killed her.

50:27.789 --> 50:29.159
Treasure?

50:33.296 --> 50:36.800
Obviously, it looks like
she's a little coked up.

50:38.066 --> 50:38.999
Answer:

50:39.001 --> 50:41.801
Taker her to the gym
and let her pump it out.

50:41.803 --> 50:43.139
Yes, sir.

50:45.307 --> 50:46.776
Oh...

50:48.410 --> 50:50.280
Kiss, hey.

50:51.914 --> 50:54.351
We had fun last night,
didn't we?

50:57.686 --> 50:59.855
Yeah, that's sexy.
I love it.

51:01.490 --> 51:03.059
Rico, change of plans.

51:04.459 --> 51:05.559
Get me Tia.

51:05.561 --> 51:09.466
It's time to find out
how this serum works personally.

51:14.503 --> 51:16.172
All right. Come on.

51:20.376 --> 51:22.979
Fuck you.

54:51.820 --> 54:53.656
<i>Kiss.</i>

55:03.765 --> 55:05.099
<i>Kiss.</i>

55:44.939 --> 55:46.342
We're gonna get out of here.

55:47.008 --> 55:48.711
I promise.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.282
I promise.

56:16.639 --> 56:17.640
Are you okay?

56:18.374 --> 56:19.542
What?

56:21.644 --> 56:22.712
Where are we?

56:25.947 --> 56:27.283
Okay.

56:28.617 --> 56:30.352
It's gonna be okay.

57:22.738 --> 57:25.071
- What's going on, man?
- I don't know.

57:25.073 --> 57:26.506
I don't know.

57:26.508 --> 57:28.544
But when they're on they're
not supposed to feel shit.

57:57.606 --> 57:59.006
What should
we tell the chief?

57:59.008 --> 58:00.640
Don't you say
a fucking word.

58:00.642 --> 58:02.108
Shit.

58:02.110 --> 58:04.646
I said just trust me
on this, okay?

58:11.720 --> 58:13.120
What's going on, boys?

58:13.122 --> 58:15.222
- Chief.
- Is there a problem, Rico?

58:15.224 --> 58:16.490
Not at all, sir.

58:16.492 --> 58:18.325
What's up with the ladies?
How they doing today?

58:18.327 --> 58:19.926
Slept about 18 hours, sir.

58:19.928 --> 58:21.231
18 hours?

58:22.497 --> 58:25.001
Looks like we've got
ourselves some sleep monsters.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.642
Hello, Tia.

58:34.977 --> 58:37.013
Or Promise. How are you?

58:40.081 --> 58:41.984
You were amazing last night.

58:42.718 --> 58:44.751
So sweet.

58:44.753 --> 58:47.657
I'm sorry I'm gonna have
to kill you and your friends.

58:53.662 --> 58:55.598
Best of luck
to both of you.

58:58.099 --> 59:00.600
Rico, here's the new plan.

59:00.602 --> 59:02.604
You're gonna give
them two shots.

59:03.372 --> 59:05.305
One shot during the gym,

59:05.307 --> 59:07.573
another shot right
before they go in the ring.

59:07.575 --> 59:09.912
But sir, that's two shots
in an hour. Are you sure?

59:11.914 --> 59:14.213
Yeah, I can do math, Rico.

59:14.215 --> 59:15.615
- Sorry, Chief.
- You understand me?

59:15.617 --> 59:17.453
- Yes, sir.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

59:17.952 --> 59:19.721
We do this right,

59:21.724 --> 59:26.296
boys, we can cash out,
we'll be sippin' Mai Tais in Thailand.

59:27.028 --> 59:28.331
Yes, sir.

59:33.035 --> 59:35.438
<i>Treasure versus Kurious.</i>

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.004
Fuck!

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:20.783
No.

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:23.983
- Let's go.
- No!

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:25.454
- Let's go.
- No!

01:00:26.287 --> 01:00:28.690
No!

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:29.986
Command!

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.821
Kill!

01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:39.588
Kris, let's be together.
We have plans.

01:02:40.055 --> 01:02:41.555
We have plans.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.950
This isn't supposed
to be like this.

01:03:10.952 --> 01:03:13.155
It's not supposed
to be like this.

01:03:27.068 --> 01:03:28.137
No!

01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:14.847
Come on.

01:04:14.849 --> 01:04:16.585
Come on, come on,
come on.

01:04:24.526 --> 01:04:26.126
Come on, come on.
Come on, Kiss.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.131
Hurry up, hurry up.
I think they're gonna come. Hurry up.

01:04:29.197 --> 01:04:31.767
- There's not enough time.
- Yes, there is.

01:05:01.762 --> 01:05:03.799
Kiss, Kiss, Kiss.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:10.604
It's not over yet.

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:13.807
This is my world!
It's just getting started.

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:16.245
Wait till you see
the second quarter, huh?

01:05:16.912 --> 01:05:19.211
You think you can escape me?

01:05:19.213 --> 01:05:21.046
Huh? Huh?

01:05:21.048 --> 01:05:23.950
Is that what's reminding you?
This is my game.

01:05:23.952 --> 01:05:24.917
My circus.

01:05:24.919 --> 01:05:27.053
You ingrates!
Break them, boys!

01:05:27.055 --> 01:05:29.555
Get back! Get back!
Get 'em in!

01:05:29.557 --> 01:05:31.957
- Get them in the cage!
- Keep going.

01:05:31.959 --> 01:05:33.894
Get them
in the cage.

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:35.461
Ah!

01:05:35.463 --> 01:05:37.400
Guess who's fighting next.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.834
Girlfriend versus girlfriend.

01:05:41.836 --> 01:05:43.602
- No.
- Lover versus lover.

01:05:43.604 --> 01:05:45.472
No, Gibson, no!

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:48.711
That's right.
Treasure versus Kiss.

01:05:50.311 --> 01:05:51.945
Yeah, sweet.

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:54.046
And now,
for the real surprise.

01:05:54.048 --> 01:05:56.184
Tia, tell 'em
who you really are.

01:05:57.519 --> 01:05:58.854
What?

01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:01.756
Promise?

01:06:03.325 --> 01:06:05.093
Go ahead, Tia. Tell 'em.

01:06:05.593 --> 01:06:06.760
I can't.

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:07.894
Yes, you can.

01:06:07.896 --> 01:06:10.463
- No, I can't.
- What did you do?

01:06:12.133 --> 01:06:13.666
Go ahead.
Tell them, Tia.

01:06:13.668 --> 01:06:15.337
Tia. Tell them, Tia.

01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:22.445
Tia?

01:06:23.845 --> 01:06:25.814
- Come on, Tia.
- Tell me, Tia.

01:06:28.282 --> 01:06:31.885
Tia brought you to me.

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.488
- Tia, tell me.
- You fucking bitch!

01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:38.860
You said you were
gonna let me go.

01:06:40.729 --> 01:06:43.562
We treated you like
you were one of us.

01:06:47.401 --> 01:06:48.771
Why?

01:06:49.704 --> 01:06:51.271
Why?

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:53.539
Why, Promise, why?

01:06:53.541 --> 01:06:56.878
Kurious is gone
because of you!

01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:58.510
I'm sorry.

01:06:58.512 --> 01:07:00.245
What's wrong with you?

01:07:00.247 --> 01:07:01.814
I'm sorry.

01:07:01.816 --> 01:07:07.320
You think you guys are the first girls
we brought and tested this serum on?

01:07:07.322 --> 01:07:12.227
Do you think anybody's gonna miss
a group of fucking strippers?

01:07:14.729 --> 01:07:18.030
Kiss that, motherfucker!

01:07:18.032 --> 01:07:21.970
No, we are not strippers,
we are fucking ladies!

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:24.838
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.244
You hit like a girl.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:33.481
That's probably why
you're on your ass, bitch.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:40.323
I'm gonna enjoy watching your
girlfriend kick your ass.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:46.829
Casey, Rico, prep 'em.

01:07:50.932 --> 01:07:52.101
Let's go.

01:07:52.467 --> 01:07:54.003
And Rico...

01:07:54.903 --> 01:07:58.307
- Chief.
- Two clicks for Treasure.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.575
One click for Kiss.

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:05.945
Treasure wins, Kiss dies.

01:08:05.947 --> 01:08:07.713
Just make it happen.

01:08:07.715 --> 01:08:09.582
- Are you sure?
- Goddamn it, Rico.

01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:11.854
- Just get it done!
- Sir.

01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:15.622
Ah!

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:16.858
God.

01:08:49.523 --> 01:08:50.925
That's my girl.

01:09:00.501 --> 01:09:01.636
That's my girl.

01:09:08.576 --> 01:09:10.443
Treasure.

01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.810
Baby. Treasure.

01:09:12.813 --> 01:09:14.082
Treasure.

01:09:14.482 --> 01:09:15.517
Baby.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:19.354
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:00.953
Oh, here he is.

01:11:00.955 --> 01:11:03.222
Jesus, who fucked you up?

01:11:03.224 --> 01:11:05.126
Go fuck
yourself, General.

01:11:06.428 --> 01:11:07.496
All right.

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:11.297
$5,000, two to one odds
on Treasure.

01:11:11.299 --> 01:11:13.132
- Who's gonna take her?
- I will.

01:11:13.134 --> 01:11:15.101
- That Kiss is my stallion.
- Yeah.

01:11:15.103 --> 01:11:17.039
- I'll take your bet.
- Even better.

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.376
Rico, bring 'em in.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.555
Command. Go.

01:12:27.107 --> 01:12:29.374
Command. Go.

01:12:29.376 --> 01:12:30.545
Go.

01:13:12.887 --> 01:13:14.453
I can see a strategy.

01:13:14.455 --> 01:13:15.855
What're you talking about?

01:13:15.857 --> 01:13:17.890
I'm surprised you can't see it.
You're the general.

01:13:17.892 --> 01:13:21.093
There's no
strategy in girls kicking ass.

01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:29.370
Gibson, if Kiss wins,
I'll be truly impressed.

01:13:31.238 --> 01:13:32.404
What you got?

01:13:32.406 --> 01:13:34.876
- From the basement.
- Oh, wow.

01:15:31.992 --> 01:15:35.127
That's the old
Ali rope-a-dope.

01:15:35.129 --> 01:15:36.962
She's wearing her down.

01:15:36.964 --> 01:15:38.364
She's playing possum.

01:15:38.366 --> 01:15:41.736
That's what I want.
Soldiers with intelligence.

01:16:14.869 --> 01:16:15.938
Fucked you up.

01:16:17.138 --> 01:16:19.105
- She got me, too.
- She got you, too.

01:16:49.536 --> 01:16:50.735
Man, I told you.

01:16:50.737 --> 01:16:53.107
She'll be my best friend
even more when we play.

01:17:23.004 --> 01:17:24.069
Shit.

01:17:24.071 --> 01:17:26.541
- -Yo, Gibson,
we got one on the loose.

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.916
<i>Chief...</i>

01:18:10.918 --> 01:18:13.021
Now she could be
the start of something special.

01:18:13.787 --> 01:18:15.120
Yeah.

01:18:15.122 --> 01:18:16.655
Now you know what
it feels like to be a winner.

01:18:16.657 --> 01:18:18.391
<i>Chief...</i>

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.624
- <i>Chief, can you hear me?</i>
- Whatever does she's on,

01:18:19.626 --> 01:18:20.926
that's the one I want.

01:18:20.928 --> 01:18:22.130
<i>Chief,
Tia's on the run.</i>

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:32.904
Gibson, I see her.

01:18:32.906 --> 01:18:33.874
She's mine.

01:19:01.235 --> 01:19:02.470
Kiss.

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.106
Tia.

01:19:06.874 --> 01:19:07.876
Tia.

01:19:09.309 --> 01:19:10.646
Tia!

01:19:13.447 --> 01:19:16.614
Come on now.
Let's make this shit easy.

01:19:16.616 --> 01:19:18.786
Don't make me
fucking hurt you, Tia.

01:19:48.281 --> 01:19:50.716
Rico, five feet back.

01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:52.821
- <i>Down on your right.</i>
- Copy that.

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.423
- Got her, Chief.
- No!

01:19:58.425 --> 01:19:59.593
No!

01:20:00.027 --> 01:20:01.163
Come here.

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:05.233
Thought you'd get
away from me, huh?

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.999
This is what I do.

01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:09.204
No!

01:20:10.804 --> 01:20:13.075
- Come on! Come on.
- No!

01:20:14.842 --> 01:20:16.812
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

01:20:17.277 --> 01:20:18.511
Come on.

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.044
This is what I do.

01:20:20.046 --> 01:20:21.082
Come on.

01:20:36.496 --> 01:20:38.396
- Come on.
- No!

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:39.532
No!

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.001
Stop resisting.

01:20:43.403 --> 01:20:45.339
Stop it.
I got her, boss.

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:48.310
You sure do, Rico.

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:54.547
That's the warm blood going to your
bowels, filling your bowels.

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:56.382
That's right. Here we go.
Here we go.

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:59.752
If you breathe, it's better. If you
breathe, it's better. You'll go faster.

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:01.289
Let it happen.

01:21:05.559 --> 01:21:07.728
Come on. You got it.

01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:10.895
You got it.

01:21:10.897 --> 01:21:13.634
Come on.
Just let it happen.

01:21:16.403 --> 01:21:17.638
Shh.

01:21:23.443 --> 01:21:25.810
Rico, you hit my girl.

01:21:25.812 --> 01:21:28.079
Guy's gotta draw
the line somewhere.

01:21:45.398 --> 01:21:47.099
Chief.

01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:49.034
I did that for you.

01:21:49.036 --> 01:21:50.703
Chief,
what the fuck happened?

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:52.240
What happened to Rico?

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.207
It was an accident.

01:21:55.209 --> 01:21:56.378
Tia killed him.

01:22:01.482 --> 01:22:02.918
I hate you!

01:22:03.584 --> 01:22:04.682
I did that for you.

01:22:04.684 --> 01:22:06.752
You did this to me!

01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:08.957
I did that for you.
I did that for you.

01:22:10.124 --> 01:22:11.358
I love you.

01:22:19.133 --> 01:22:21.900
I did this
whole thing for you.

01:22:21.902 --> 01:22:24.736
Nobody else,
all of this shit for you!

01:22:24.738 --> 01:22:27.875
The whole fucking thing
is for fucking you!

01:22:29.076 --> 01:22:31.680
This whole fucking thing
is for you!

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.959
You're a maniac!

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:47.659
I want you.

01:22:47.661 --> 01:22:48.894
- You want me?
- Yes.

01:22:48.896 --> 01:22:50.863
- You can't handle me.
- Yes, I can.

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.931
And you are not
a fucking man.

01:22:52.933 --> 01:22:54.699
You are not a fucking man.

01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:56.103
We'll see.

01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:57.872
Casey.

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.440
Get 'em in the cage.

01:23:01.442 --> 01:23:03.976
And when I give you the order,

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:08.012
you clean Kiss up,
you get her in the ring.

01:23:08.014 --> 01:23:10.382
It's time for me
to show this little bitch

01:23:10.384 --> 01:23:13.354
what a trained solider
can do on the serum.

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.192
In the cage.

01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:19.427
In the cage.

01:23:20.126 --> 01:23:21.463
In the cage.

01:23:23.863 --> 01:23:25.267
Face the wall. Let's go.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.802
Move.

01:23:28.602 --> 01:23:30.272
This is love.

01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:37.876
Kiss.

01:23:37.878 --> 01:23:39.410
Grand champion.

01:23:39.412 --> 01:23:42.013
That girl can kick
some motherfuckin' ass.

01:23:42.015 --> 01:23:46.150
Gibson, give that serum
to a soldier with intelligence,

01:23:46.152 --> 01:23:49.223
and imagine what we could
do out in the field.

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:52.826
Imagine the money
we're gonna make.

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:57.165
I want the dosage
that's in Kiss.

01:24:00.634 --> 01:24:04.369
I'm glad
you brought that up.

01:24:04.371 --> 01:24:08.207
I know you guys traveled a long way
to come out here and check this out.

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.178
I know we got
a lot on the line.

01:24:13.914 --> 01:24:15.916
Casey, prep Kiss.

01:24:20.987 --> 01:24:22.988
Where are you going now?

01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:24.992
Daddy's gotta go to work.

01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:48.350
I'm sorry.

01:24:49.683 --> 01:24:51.816
Please don't give up on me.

01:24:55.656 --> 01:24:57.125
It's time.

01:25:09.269 --> 01:25:10.405
Let's go.

01:25:23.851 --> 01:25:25.186
Kiss!

01:25:32.559 --> 01:25:34.062
Kiss!

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:18.963
15 years in the special forces.

01:27:18.965 --> 01:27:21.201
You don't deserve to fight me.

01:27:22.202 --> 01:27:24.101
You're just an experiment.

01:27:24.103 --> 01:27:25.639
I got the champ.

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:31.246
Command. Kill them both.

01:28:47.187 --> 01:28:49.122
Two on one. Ow.

01:29:03.437 --> 01:29:04.735
Yes!

01:29:04.737 --> 01:29:07.575
Yes! Way to go, Beast.

01:29:35.969 --> 01:29:37.535
Kiss.

01:29:39.372 --> 01:29:40.838
Wanna bring her in, Chief?

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.307
Stay right there, Casey.
You can bring her in after I kill her.

01:29:43.309 --> 01:29:45.146
You running out
of experiments?

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.680
Want some of this?

01:29:48.682 --> 01:29:50.550
This woman too much
for you, Gibson?

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:56.555
Be a fucking man, then!

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:57.892
Be a fucking man.

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:02.026
- You're gonna OD on that shit, man.
- Shut up!

01:30:02.028 --> 01:30:03.630
Be a fucking man.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:09.200
You lay down.
You run when I tell you to run.

01:30:09.202 --> 01:30:11.371
If Gibson wins,

01:30:12.339 --> 01:30:13.908
I'll pay for the serum.

01:30:14.808 --> 01:30:18.278
If Kiss wins,
you pay for it.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.849
Gibby's my boy.

01:30:22.849 --> 01:30:24.382
Of course. Deal.

01:30:24.384 --> 01:30:25.753
Well, that's...

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.153
Don't be scared now.

01:30:28.155 --> 01:30:29.820
Don't be scared now.

01:30:29.822 --> 01:30:32.360
Stay right there, Casey.
Don't make a fucking move.

01:30:39.799 --> 01:30:41.235
You fucking bastard.

01:31:03.256 --> 01:31:05.226
You can't count
Kiss out just yet.

01:31:35.188 --> 01:31:37.689
Come on, Senator.
It's game over.

01:31:37.691 --> 01:31:38.659
Come on.

01:31:39.358 --> 01:31:41.262
Get up. Come on, Kiss.

01:31:42.262 --> 01:31:44.462
Come on.
I thought you were bad.

01:31:44.464 --> 01:31:45.830
I thought you're a badass.

01:31:45.832 --> 01:31:48.902
Nothing like a little foreplay.
Oh, that's right.

01:31:49.335 --> 01:31:50.570
Yeah, girl.

01:32:29.276 --> 01:32:30.978
Kiss.

01:32:35.682 --> 01:32:38.949
You wanna do it the easy way.
Right, this is it.

01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:40.754
Don't cry. Don't cry.

01:32:48.795 --> 01:32:50.064
<i>Kiss.</i>

01:33:04.443 --> 01:33:06.013
Badass bitch.

01:33:16.956 --> 01:33:18.323
Promise, run!

01:33:19.759 --> 01:33:20.794
Run!

01:33:21.827 --> 01:33:23.227
Kiss, what about you?

01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:24.866
- Run! Go, Promise!
- Shit.

01:33:26.599 --> 01:33:27.602
Oh.

01:33:33.205 --> 01:33:34.741
That count as a win?

01:33:36.375 --> 01:33:38.912
It's a big win
for all of us.

01:33:40.714 --> 01:33:44.583
I think it's time to take
the serum to our partners.

01:33:44.585 --> 01:33:46.251
You know,
for a minute there,

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:49.687
I thought you're all about scratching
this whole deal over cat fights.

01:33:49.689 --> 01:33:53.525
Well,
looks like the ladies came out on top.

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:55.025
It's been fun, General,

01:33:55.027 --> 01:33:58.329
but I have to fly back
for a senate hearing

01:33:58.331 --> 01:34:00.735
on our new deal with China
in the morning.

01:34:02.068 --> 01:34:04.202
Give Gibson a kiss for me.

01:34:12.478 --> 01:34:14.014
Is there some replay
on this shit?

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:35.736
Hey! Hey!

01:34:37.103 --> 01:34:38.472
Stop, please.

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:41.006
Stop, please!

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.677
Please come back!

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:47.113
Please stop.

01:34:58.058 --> 01:34:59.093
Come on.

01:35:04.196 --> 01:35:05.896
Thank you. Thank you.

01:35:05.898 --> 01:35:07.834
It's going to be okay.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.072
I promise.

01:35:21.447 --> 01:35:23.414
<i>This is warfare.</i>

01:35:23.416 --> 01:35:26.219
<i>You want soldiers
to kill without guilt.</i>

01:35:27.853 --> 01:35:30.523
<i>This is the perfect
fighting machine.</i>

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:34.929
<i>The serum brings out
pure primal instincts.</i>

01:35:36.996 --> 01:35:41.668
<i>Imagine what the serum can do to a
solider who's been properly trained.</i>

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:45.906
<i>The limits? Endless.</i>

01:35:48.308 --> 01:35:49.807
<i>That's what I want.</i>

01:35:49.809 --> 01:35:52.045
<i>Soldiers with intelligence.</i>

01:36:01.021 --> 01:36:02.320
<i>Kiss.</i>

01:36:02.322 --> 01:36:05.058
<i>Now, she could be the start
of something special.</i>

01:36:06.226 --> 01:36:07.928
<i>Badass bitch.</i>
