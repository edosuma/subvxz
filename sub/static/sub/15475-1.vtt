The Himalayas, Nepalese Border

01:39.580 --> 01:40.671
Go

01:43.980 --> 01:46.538
Fall back

01:49.613 --> 01:50.170
Fall back

02:08.613 --> 02:10.841
Do you really believe in God

02:12.847 --> 02:15.711
Such faith is a blessing

02:16.647 --> 02:18.908
In the 30 years at Coral Scientific

02:19.013 --> 02:21.139
God never showed his face

02:22.814 --> 02:25.473
I've spent my entire life

02:25.714 --> 02:28.806
pursuing this Chinese secret to immortality

02:29.547 --> 02:32.673
And now all I need is the last one

02:32.946 --> 02:36.436
of the 24 divine pieces

02:38.613 --> 02:40.079
Your Reverence

02:40.180 --> 02:43.112
if your God's unavailable today

02:43.913 --> 02:45.471
Please

02:46.714 --> 02:48.839
Mr Hendrix

02:49.714 --> 02:52.510
When you are my age

02:53.480 --> 02:56.935
You realize death is certain

02:58.846 --> 03:00.074
Really

03:01.780 --> 03:02.644
Very interesting

03:06.480 --> 03:07.968
If that's What you want

03:09.680 --> 03:10.669
Let's fight them

03:31.246 --> 03:33.542
The gods have spoken

03:33.747 --> 03:35.940
We'll be saved

03:39.246 --> 03:41.803
I have no time to deal with you

04:57.180 --> 04:58.476
You guys go out and check

06:10.779 --> 06:12.075
Zhang Qiling

06:12.779 --> 06:16.212
The last divine piece is beneath the statue

06:24.513 --> 06:27.104
The method of its destruction
can be found on it

06:27.213 --> 06:28.975
We're running out of time

06:29.080 --> 06:32.069
Hurry up and find it

06:32.246 --> 06:35.110
To avoid a disaster to mankind

06:35.213 --> 06:36.701
You have to take an oath

06:36.813 --> 06:38.905
You have to complete your mission
even in hell

06:52.046 --> 06:53.103
Wait

06:53.980 --> 06:55.605
Who are you

09:37.646 --> 09:41.442
House of Wu, the warehouse

10:22.779 --> 10:24.745
Mr Wu, What are you

10:26.013 --> 10:27.501
I'm waiting for a friend

10:43.213 --> 10:44.542
Open the third blind

10:44.646 --> 10:45.204
Only half open

10:45.512 --> 10:46.478
Go ahead

10:46.746 --> 10:48.008
One, two, three

11:02.080 --> 11:03.671
Who are you

11:05.113 --> 11:06.806
I'm a writer

11:07.180 --> 11:09.146
Someone referred me here

11:09.246 --> 11:10.939
I heard you have a fascinating story

11:11.046 --> 11:13.012
And want to turn it into a novel

11:15.746 --> 11:18.735
My memories to others are stories

11:18.846 --> 11:22.006
I hope to do it before I can't tell Whether
it's my memory or a story

11:22.879 --> 11:24.606
You can help me record it

11:24.779 --> 11:25.540
Wonderful

11:25.646 --> 11:27.044
Let's begin

11:33.246 --> 11:36.906
This should be a story about me and him

11:41.213 --> 11:43.542
When did it begin

11:43.646 --> 11:44.669
How did it end

11:45.046 --> 11:46.944
Should he tell it about me

11:47.246 --> 11:48.939
Or me about him

11:49.046 --> 11:51.603
I tell it about him, he about me

11:51.946 --> 11:53.140
Or I tell the story about him

11:53.679 --> 11:55.043
Let's do this

11:56.479 --> 11:58.071
You know the maternity ward of
the Wu hospital

11:58.180 --> 12:00.010
Do you know when it prohibited smoking

12:04.679 --> 12:05.543
My birth

12:05.646 --> 12:07.806
Was a matter of impedance to my family

12:08.146 --> 12:09.475
But I didn't know

12:09.579 --> 12:11.046
Why was I important

12:11.479 --> 12:13.037
But on the day I was born

12:13.146 --> 12:14.169
Everyone

12:14.479 --> 12:16.105
They seemed to have
prepared for a long time

12:16.579 --> 12:17.670
As if my birth

12:17.779 --> 12:19.871
Would bring an incredible
change to the family

12:20.546 --> 12:22.512
Wu Yiqiong, your Wife has given birth

12:22.612 --> 12:23.635
It's a boy

12:23.746 --> 12:24.507
He's born

12:24.612 --> 12:25.510
Father, it's a boy

12:45.180 --> 12:46.839
What a pristine child

12:47.512 --> 12:48.672
Our family

12:48.779 --> 12:51.041
Finally has a pristine member

12:57.113 --> 12:59.477
I'll name him Wu Xie

13:00.512 --> 13:02.138
Pristine and innocent

13:02.546 --> 13:04.035
Yes, Wu Xie

13:04.146 --> 13:06.441
Grandfather thought the name Wu Xie

13:06.546 --> 13:08.569
Could have brought me a relatively
ordinary life

13:08.679 --> 13:09.611
But

13:09.713 --> 13:11.077
To have someone who hasn't experienced
the extraordinary

13:11.180 --> 13:12.703
to sing the praises of ordinary

13:12.813 --> 13:14.472
The result would often be bitter

13:19.612 --> 13:20.737
Lower

13:23.546 --> 13:26.205
Wu Xie, lower

13:32.779 --> 13:37.042
Wu Xie, how come the butterflies
have flown away

13:37.479 --> 13:39.037
I did it on purpose

13:39.146 --> 13:40.078
Which one of you believe

13:40.179 --> 13:41.873
We don't believe

13:41.980 --> 13:42.912
No problem

13:43.013 --> 13:44.172
Let's play hide and seek

13:44.479 --> 13:46.003
Wu Xie

13:46.646 --> 13:47.544
Wu Xie

13:47.646 --> 13:49.635
How come it's me again

15:13.746 --> 15:16.678
Relief

15:17.512 --> 15:22.172
The Ninth Family

16:03.079 --> 16:04.204
I'll give this back to you

16:11.713 --> 16:18.806
Life is a dream

16:19.079 --> 16:27.070
What is unreal would be real

16:27.846 --> 16:37.507
Life is a mirror that shows your reflection

16:37.980 --> 16:47.175
But I hope the reflection doesn't show
the mundane

16:48.479 --> 16:49.809
Every month in this family

16:49.913 --> 16:51.640
A member dies

16:51.746 --> 16:53.075
It was after a long time

16:53.179 --> 16:54.668
did I realize my elders

16:54.779 --> 16:56.541
are tomb raiders

16:56.646 --> 17:03.944
Flowers bloom and flowers Wilt
are a way of life

17:04.579 --> 17:06.568
Family such as mine were originally nine

17:06.913 --> 17:08.675
They were called The Nine Families

17:08.846 --> 17:10.073
The top three families were aristocrats

17:10.179 --> 17:11.542
the middle thieves

17:11.646 --> 17:12.907
and the lower three families were merchants

17:13.546 --> 17:14.842
The Nine Families declined in influence
eventually

17:14.945 --> 17:17.138
And their descendents gradually drifted
away from the family businesses

17:17.244 --> 17:22.076
How can life be as you Wish

17:23.479 --> 17:28.002
Autumn leaves fall and Winter snow comes

17:34.179 --> 17:37.168
Sixteen Years Later

17:51.245 --> 17:53.905
Museum of the Warring States Period
Widow's Grave

17:55.846 --> 17:58.107
The wealth and sickness markings on
the Luban ruler

17:58.212 --> 17:59.770
The corner of separation and altruism

18:04.879 --> 18:06.208
The emperor is in the heavens

18:06.512 --> 18:07.478
Countless offerings to the ancestors

18:07.579 --> 18:08.739
It's strange

18:09.813 --> 18:11.870
This Widow's Grave is a
commoner's cementary

18:13.012 --> 18:15.536
How come it uses the measurements for
royal architecture?

18:15.813 --> 18:16.677
Boss

18:16.779 --> 18:18.211
Who cares if it's commoners or royals?

18:18.512 --> 18:19.909
What does it matter to us?

18:20.012 --> 18:21.445
Let's hurry and go back

18:21.546 --> 18:22.978
We can't leave the shop unattended

18:23.079 --> 18:24.102
No

18:24.612 --> 18:26.100
The years I've spent learning about
ancient architecture

18:26.212 --> 18:28.872
If I don't put it into practice

18:28.978 --> 18:30.604
It would be a waste

18:39.813 --> 18:40.937
As I see it

18:41.045 --> 18:42.842
There is a problem with this Widow's Grave

18:43.045 --> 18:44.875
But if I want to know the answer

18:45.179 --> 18:46.805
I'd have to dismantle it

18:47.012 --> 18:48.843
To understand its true nature

18:49.579 --> 18:50.773
Boss

18:50.878 --> 18:52.538
I don't understand at all

18:52.646 --> 18:53.168
Why don't you tell me

18:53.479 --> 18:55.844
Why don't you let your Uncle
Three take you to a tomb

18:56.912 --> 18:57.743
Let me tell you

18:57.846 --> 19:00.608
My family would never want
to see me go into a tomb

19:01.079 --> 19:02.909
Especially my Uncle Three

19:03.479 --> 19:04.104
This

19:04.212 --> 19:05.474
Should never reach his ears

19:05.845 --> 19:07.437
You didn't tell him, did you

19:20.679 --> 19:21.668
Uncle Three

19:23.479 --> 19:25.571
How many times did I tell you

19:26.212 --> 19:27.007
Not to come here

19:27.112 --> 19:28.510
Not to come

19:29.012 --> 19:30.672
Who the hell let you in

19:30.912 --> 19:32.208
Uncle Three, please
listen to my explanation

19:32.512 --> 19:34.876
This is a political assignment sent from
my school

19:34.978 --> 19:36.206
I came down here to

19:36.512 --> 19:37.034
restore the structure

19:37.145 --> 19:38.703
Restore the structure

19:38.945 --> 19:41.571
What doesn't come apart in your hands

19:41.679 --> 19:42.736
In order to restore, I have to dismantle it

19:42.845 --> 19:44.107
The restoration is for the purposes of
dismantling

19:44.212 --> 19:45.610
Is this your logic

19:45.713 --> 19:47.110
Something like that

19:47.212 --> 19:48.201
Let me tell you

19:48.512 --> 19:50.171
The vampire moths in this tombs are fierce

19:51.079 --> 19:52.739
Hurry up I saw a lot of moths just now

19:52.845 --> 19:53.868
Wait, let me take a photograph

19:56.079 --> 19:57.477
Don't

20:14.012 --> 20:15.842
You're crushing me, you son of a bitch

20:15.945 --> 20:16.809
Don't blame me

20:16.912 --> 20:17.844
How are you doing

20:17.945 --> 20:20.071
I'm fine Did you get hurt

20:20.845 --> 20:22.437
If you're fine, then

20:28.212 --> 20:30.440
Inside this Widow's Grave

20:30.546 --> 20:32.512
What else is hiding

20:32.679 --> 20:33.872
This is to borrow other
people's Dragon Vein

20:33.979 --> 20:35.173
To nurture one's corpse

20:42.845 --> 20:44.834
In the desert hills in the west

20:44.945 --> 20:46.639
There was an ancient kingdom of
the western desert

20:46.745 --> 20:47.939
called Tamutuo

20:48.212 --> 20:50.837
It's ruled by the Snake Empress

20:50.945 --> 20:52.809
I was captured by King Xiang

20:52.912 --> 20:54.072
And was forced to offer my services
as a craftsman

20:54.179 --> 20:55.646
To build the tomb of the Snake Empress

20:55.745 --> 20:56.870
It's three thousand metres deep

20:56.978 --> 20:58.536
Filled with the finest gold and jade

20:58.646 --> 21:01.010
I left after 18 years,
and all was suspicious

21:01.112 --> 21:03.545
Iron Mask recorded this on a stele

21:03.713 --> 21:04.577
The Tomb of the Snake Empress

21:04.679 --> 21:07.043
That was the ancient kingdom
in the Gobi Desert

21:08.845 --> 21:10.107
Who is Iron Mask

21:10.212 --> 21:11.576
What has he got to do with the Widow

21:12.479 --> 21:14.206
How come they are lain in upper
and lower decks

21:14.845 --> 21:17.937
Iron Mask must be an architect

21:18.179 --> 21:19.009
You said he could build

21:19.112 --> 21:21.636
tombs on the scale of that of
the Snake Empress

21:21.778 --> 21:24.609
He must have been the best craftsman of
the time

21:52.978 --> 21:54.705
You torch is bright enough

23:05.845 --> 23:07.743
Which way are you running

23:25.512 --> 23:26.705
Go, hurry

23:31.012 --> 23:32.944
Stan the car Go

23:48.112 --> 23:50.737
We witnessed the extraordinary phenomenon
of moths rushing out of a well

23:50.845 --> 23:52.868
And the video sent by a passerby

23:52.978 --> 23:55.206
It was shot in the place behind me

23:59.912 --> 24:00.935
Scan it Yes sir

24:17.645 --> 24:22.203
We found it

25:27.412 --> 25:29.003
Can't you hear it, Uncle Three

25:29.745 --> 25:30.303
What can't I hear

25:30.812 --> 25:31.903
What should I hear

25:32.145 --> 25:33.009
Listen to this

25:39.812 --> 25:40.642
Uncle Three, take this

25:41.312 --> 25:43.210
I'm going to take it apart Take it apart

25:43.312 --> 25:44.142
Why are you taking something apart again

25:44.245 --> 25:45.006
What would happen if you break it

25:45.112 --> 25:46.839
Don't try to tear it apart,
you little smart ass

25:47.645 --> 25:48.203
Don't you want to see inside

25:49.045 --> 25:49.738
I do

25:50.079 --> 25:50.806
Hammer

25:53.745 --> 25:54.303
Tweezers

25:57.212 --> 25:57.973
Turn it around

25:58.079 --> 25:59.045
Crane plier

26:00.045 --> 26:02.704
We have to take the first plug out

26:09.412 --> 26:10.673
Mission accomplished

26:13.279 --> 26:14.302
I'm going to take the second one out

26:19.645 --> 26:20.668
Wipe my sweat

26:26.212 --> 26:27.201
Use some force

26:28.645 --> 26:31.942
I did Harder

26:33.411 --> 26:34.707
Screwdriver mallet

26:37.812 --> 26:38.370
Circlip pliers

27:00.945 --> 27:01.911
Look

27:02.978 --> 27:04.035
It's moving

27:04.145 --> 27:07.009
This should be from the
Warring States Period

27:07.112 --> 27:08.340
I don't think so

27:08.645 --> 27:09.668
Over two thousand years ago

27:09.778 --> 27:10.938
How would they have made clocks?

27:11.045 --> 27:12.602
Uncle Three, this is not a clock

27:12.712 --> 27:15.270
You see, there are the markings of the year
and date

27:15.778 --> 27:18.302
Every time it revolves
it touches the trigger

27:19.346 --> 27:20.869
And it moves forward a grid

27:21.112 --> 27:23.340
Until there is no more grid at the bottom

27:24.245 --> 27:25.268
This is a countdown

27:26.245 --> 27:28.609
There aren't that many grids left

27:29.645 --> 27:30.203
There are eight days left

27:30.411 --> 27:31.605
Eight days

27:31.778 --> 27:33.267
But What do you think

27:33.778 --> 27:35.267
it's counting down to

27:40.145 --> 27:43.271
Good question

27:45.678 --> 27:47.872
Now I remember, in grandfather's notebook

27:48.012 --> 27:50.206
There was a record of Fox Face

28:10.878 --> 28:12.742
In the Warring States Period

28:12.845 --> 28:15.641
There was a kingdom in the west called
Kunlun Qucha

28:15.745 --> 28:17.370
It was overthrown by the Black Khan

28:17.912 --> 28:21.140
I followed King Xiang into Tamutuo

28:21.245 --> 28:23.301
When King Xiang saw the Snake Empress

28:23.411 --> 28:24.900
They fell in love

28:25.012 --> 28:27.001
The Empress gave the king armor made of
meteorites

28:27.112 --> 28:29.044
And passed him the secret of immortality

28:29.145 --> 28:31.168
Mankind is pathetic

28:31.645 --> 28:34.976
They are too scared to change
their own destiny

28:36.112 --> 28:40.340
I know the secret to eternal life

28:42.012 --> 28:45.172
But they took me for a succubus

28:55.345 --> 28:56.277
The Snake Empress said

28:56.378 --> 28:59.345
Seven stars in the sky converge
every 2000 years

28:59.645 --> 29:03.101
If one takes the magical herb,
one will sleep for 2000 years

29:03.212 --> 29:06.974
And wake up when the seven stars
converge again

29:07.079 --> 29:09.205
And then live forever

29:09.311 --> 29:12.869
King Xiang ordered the best craftsman
Iron Mask

29:12.978 --> 29:15.138
to bring six tribes of craftsmen from the
Western Region

29:15.244 --> 29:16.870
To construct the tomb of the Snake Empress

29:17.079 --> 29:18.943
in order for her to work her magic

29:23.845 --> 29:25.811
2000 years later

29:25.912 --> 29:27.708
We will meet again

29:47.812 --> 29:50.608
Iron Mask was suspicious of the magic
of the Empress and was imprisoned

29:50.712 --> 29:54.770
So he carved What he knew on
24 copper pieces

29:54.978 --> 29:57.070
And took with him the key to the tomb

29:57.179 --> 29:58.667
And fled

30:14.145 --> 30:15.077
Key

30:15.178 --> 30:17.304
We have to find Tamutuo in eight days

30:17.411 --> 30:19.173
And enter the Tomb of the Snake Empress

30:19.278 --> 30:22.109
I'm definitely going on this raid

30:43.144 --> 30:44.201
Hurry up and make some calls

30:44.378 --> 30:46.106
Is the equipment ready for going down into
the tomb

30:46.211 --> 30:47.076
All ready

30:48.144 --> 30:49.338
Screw steel pipe

30:49.678 --> 30:50.166
Collapsible shovel

30:50.345 --> 30:52.334
And nylon rope and bandages are ready

30:52.678 --> 30:54.974
What about night vision and
waterproof mining lamps

30:55.079 --> 30:56.977
Master Three,
you didn't give us enough money

30:57.678 --> 31:00.201
You're so stupid. Get up

31:00.812 --> 31:01.972
What's the point of saving a little money

31:02.745 --> 31:04.837
Let me tell you,
we'll learn a lot when we get there

31:04.945 --> 31:05.934
Forget this small amount of money

31:06.045 --> 31:07.670
We'll give everything that we've got

31:07.778 --> 31:10.210
Endure the hardships and get this done

31:43.845 --> 31:46.743
This old, black metal sword was made of
meteorites

31:46.845 --> 31:49.743
Left by the Black Back of the
Ninth Family 30 years ago

31:51.111 --> 31:52.839
We're following the old rules

31:52.945 --> 31:56.900
We'll let Whoever can
pick it up come join us

31:58.012 --> 32:00.706
The first challenger, Li Tiezhu

32:06.045 --> 32:08.101
The way he picks up the sword is wrong

32:09.812 --> 32:10.869
Next

32:11.178 --> 32:12.167
Wang Kai

32:19.411 --> 32:25.105
Looks like only Pan Zi can pick it up

32:46.712 --> 32:47.803
Yo, bro

32:48.345 --> 32:49.709
Can you do it or not

32:50.244 --> 32:51.301
If you can't do it, go home to your farm

32:52.311 --> 32:53.778
Who is this

32:54.978 --> 32:55.967
Hey

34:51.011 --> 34:51.773
Da Kui

35:07.044 --> 35:09.010
This guy's got mad skills

35:09.111 --> 35:11.373
Don't be late tomorrow morning

35:52.712 --> 35:53.644
Here you go

36:10.311 --> 36:14.369
The Western Regions, the Border

36:16.911 --> 36:18.002
Old Man

36:19.144 --> 36:20.304
Step on the gas

36:20.811 --> 36:22.369
We have three days left,
and you're going so slowly

36:22.678 --> 36:25.076
Please, hurry up Yes, there's no time

36:25.678 --> 36:26.871
Are we going mining

36:27.011 --> 36:29.171
In the tombs here are slabstones made with
iron water

36:29.645 --> 36:31.042
If you don't use this
What are you going to use

36:31.144 --> 36:31.871
Nail clippers

36:31.978 --> 36:33.775
What you have there is a grenade

36:33.877 --> 36:35.037
With little ball bearings inside

36:35.311 --> 36:36.072
When you pull the trigger

36:36.178 --> 36:36.905
Bang

36:37.011 --> 36:38.637
Everyone in the truck becomes holey

36:38.745 --> 36:39.768
Holey

36:41.678 --> 36:42.610
Holy balls

36:42.712 --> 36:44.269
Yes, Holy balls You're holy balls

36:45.244 --> 36:46.233
Little Master Three

36:48.311 --> 36:49.834
Here, Da Kui

36:51.712 --> 36:54.803
Master Three, how come we never saw you
bring your nephew out to the tombs

36:55.011 --> 36:58.205
He's all grown up now

37:16.911 --> 37:18.968
When I was studying
psychology in university

37:19.078 --> 37:20.169
My professor said

37:20.278 --> 37:21.971
There are two kinds of people who love
looking at mirrors

37:22.244 --> 37:24.176
The first are ones that
don't know themselves

37:24.645 --> 37:26.611
The other are those that know themselves
very well

37:27.744 --> 37:29.006
Which one are you

37:43.378 --> 37:46.174
Can you not look at the sky
at 45 degrees all the time

37:46.977 --> 37:48.341
Nicholas Zhaosi once said

37:48.645 --> 37:49.906
If you keep on staring at the sky

37:50.178 --> 37:52.372
you'll forget the taste
of beer and fried chicken

37:55.711 --> 37:57.803
My name is Wu Xie, What is yours?

38:00.144 --> 38:01.372
If you don't tell me

38:01.777 --> 38:03.039
I'll call you Shtum

38:05.078 --> 38:07.874
Actually, I'm also a reticent and
handsome man

38:09.311 --> 38:11.243
It doesn't matter Whether
you like to talk or not

38:11.844 --> 38:14.936
What is important is that
I know you're a good guy

38:29.711 --> 38:30.371
Look

38:31.078 --> 38:32.908
I said you're a good guy

38:39.744 --> 38:41.336
The Tomb of the Empress is so dangerous

38:42.111 --> 38:43.373
Why do you want to go down there

38:44.178 --> 38:46.270
My family never lets me get down tombs

38:48.078 --> 38:49.976
But the less they want me to go

38:50.411 --> 38:52.036
The more I want to go

38:52.311 --> 38:53.300
What did you grandfather say

38:53.411 --> 38:54.740
He urged you again and again

38:54.844 --> 38:56.776
Don't enter this business

38:56.877 --> 38:58.173
But you insist on going in

38:59.345 --> 39:01.175
But What you mean by going in

39:01.911 --> 39:03.344
Means going out to me

39:04.777 --> 39:06.175
I'm all grown up

39:07.011 --> 39:08.943
I can make my own way

39:10.211 --> 39:11.143
When I was a child

39:12.311 --> 39:14.607
I snuck into a maze-like place

39:15.644 --> 39:17.202
It appeared in my dreams again and again

39:17.345 --> 39:19.175
And I couldn't get out of the maze

39:21.877 --> 39:23.673
People told me this is my demon

39:24.677 --> 39:26.905
You think if you can get out of
the Empress's Tomb

39:27.911 --> 39:29.707
you can get rid of your demons

39:34.677 --> 39:36.007
What about you

39:37.411 --> 39:39.377
Do you know there's a kind of
people in the west

39:39.777 --> 39:41.244
that are divinely inspired bards

39:42.378 --> 39:44.071
After a period of time

39:44.178 --> 39:46.076
They forget the memories of the past

39:49.111 --> 39:50.736
When I look into the mirror

39:51.278 --> 39:55.370
I always doubt Whether I actually exist

39:57.711 --> 39:59.075
Can you cure it

40:05.711 --> 40:08.235
That's Why I treasure everything that I've
experienced

40:09.144 --> 40:10.133
Don't worry

40:10.977 --> 40:12.773
I'll record them for you with my camera

40:13.111 --> 40:14.873
You won't be lost

40:15.244 --> 40:16.710
The world is so enormous

40:16.811 --> 40:18.300
If I come or I go

40:18.411 --> 40:19.672
Who cares

40:21.345 --> 40:23.674
But before I lose myself

40:24.144 --> 40:25.667
I will finish this business

40:58.211 --> 40:59.177
Brothers

40:59.644 --> 41:02.633
We've arrived at the gate of
Snake Empress's palace

41:04.911 --> 41:07.071
Let's get on with it Yeah

41:13.411 --> 41:14.706
Shtum

41:18.011 --> 41:18.943
Don't move

41:21.278 --> 41:23.040
How about it. Was it a good picture

41:23.744 --> 41:24.336
Give me your address

41:24.811 --> 41:26.777
and I'll send it to you when we get back

41:27.944 --> 41:29.671
What is so scary about going into a tomb

41:31.011 --> 41:31.909
Don't worry

41:32.011 --> 41:33.307
I'll look after you

41:39.944 --> 41:42.240
Oh yes, I forgot my two hammers

41:42.345 --> 41:43.777
Go get them for me Hammers

41:43.877 --> 41:45.105
Wait

41:45.345 --> 41:46.833
Give me that key thing

41:46.944 --> 41:48.308
Don't break it

42:01.111 --> 42:02.907
Uncle Three, What are you doing

42:03.345 --> 42:05.243
Good bye to you

42:05.644 --> 42:06.633
Open the door Let's go

42:08.644 --> 42:09.667
Shtum

42:13.644 --> 42:15.633
It's safer for you to stay in the truck

42:16.244 --> 42:17.176
Uncle Three

42:17.877 --> 42:19.344
You promised

42:20.144 --> 42:21.042
What if I need to pee or poo

42:25.144 --> 42:26.372
You sly fox

42:28.244 --> 42:31.108
It's not so easy to lock me in

44:00.877 --> 44:02.002
Mr Hendrix

44:02.111 --> 44:04.134
I think they've found the Tomb

44:04.244 --> 44:07.369
These raiders have some skills after all

44:08.677 --> 44:10.734
I see everything is on track

44:10.844 --> 44:12.901
If it's really that simple

44:13.744 --> 44:15.801
You wouldn't have come looking for me

44:16.078 --> 44:17.805
They have the key

44:18.344 --> 44:21.073
If What you're looking
for isn't in that tomb

44:21.344 --> 44:23.868
Well, that's not my problem

44:24.011 --> 44:25.773
That is the right attitude

44:26.111 --> 44:28.941
What I'm doing isn't about right or wrong

44:29.278 --> 44:31.642
It's about how much

44:49.344 --> 44:50.742
Who are you

44:51.144 --> 44:53.133
No, that's not possible

44:54.977 --> 44:56.306
Keep them alive, Ning

44:58.211 --> 44:59.143
Let's move

44:59.278 --> 45:00.801
Yes, Captain

45:18.344 --> 45:20.004
East is on the left

45:20.111 --> 45:21.100
West is on the right

45:21.711 --> 45:22.734
Ahead is south

45:22.844 --> 45:23.742
And north is behind

45:24.310 --> 45:26.175
You can't see it during Winter

45:26.310 --> 45:28.902
When the tide rises in spring and summer,
the mountain shows itself

45:29.211 --> 45:31.700
I've been to all kinds of mountains before

45:31.811 --> 45:34.743
I know Where the entrance is

45:34.911 --> 45:35.672
Put down the nails

45:47.211 --> 45:48.143
Zhong

45:50.243 --> 45:51.732
Go Hurry

45:55.344 --> 45:56.175
Ready

45:56.277 --> 45:57.108
One, two, three

46:37.144 --> 46:38.667
We're rich

46:38.777 --> 46:41.539
Rich

46:43.178 --> 46:44.167
What's the matter

46:44.744 --> 46:45.904
Get a hold of him

46:46.011 --> 46:47.499
Help

46:47.610 --> 46:48.599
Give me your hand

46:49.111 --> 46:50.043
Hold on tight

46:56.744 --> 46:57.904
Are you sick

47:15.544 --> 47:16.169
Listen

47:17.510 --> 47:19.476
This is King Xiang's welcome gift to us

47:23.210 --> 47:24.870
Be careful, guys

47:25.510 --> 47:28.966
Stay alive to get out of here

47:31.777 --> 47:32.607
What are you doing

47:32.711 --> 47:33.404
Are you possessed

47:39.711 --> 47:40.541
Anesthetic Needle

47:43.044 --> 47:44.010
Go

47:45.477 --> 47:45.943
Dan Dan

47:59.944 --> 48:01.706
Our friends

48:01.811 --> 48:03.834
Lift your lamps higher

48:04.711 --> 48:05.768
Get out our weapons

48:06.610 --> 48:07.132
As they say

48:07.744 --> 48:10.608
It's fate that brought us together

48:10.711 --> 48:11.438
Master Three

48:11.544 --> 48:12.840
Those are foreigners

48:14.110 --> 48:16.975
Do you speak Zhongwen

48:17.811 --> 48:18.641
Chinese

48:18.744 --> 48:20.141
Chinese

48:20.577 --> 48:23.908
So speak Chinese to them

48:24.011 --> 48:25.670
We're the same kind of people

48:25.777 --> 48:27.869
I'm a tomb raider too

48:27.978 --> 48:31.171
As long as you pass us the key
to the tomb gate

48:31.477 --> 48:34.069
Master Three. How did they find out
Then we're a family

48:34.177 --> 48:35.166
Or else

48:35.477 --> 48:37.773
We'll bury you in this place
Go fuck yourself

48:38.811 --> 48:39.743
Get down

48:39.844 --> 48:40.901
Take cover

48:43.044 --> 48:43.737
What the hell

48:43.844 --> 48:44.605
Let's fight them

48:50.811 --> 48:51.743
Move in

48:51.944 --> 48:52.739
Cover me

49:02.744 --> 49:03.642
Give me a gun

49:11.577 --> 49:12.702
Stop it

49:12.811 --> 49:13.572
Stop it

49:13.677 --> 49:15.109
Your weapons are too strong

49:15.210 --> 49:16.699
You want the key, don't you

49:16.811 --> 49:17.902
I'll give you the key

49:18.011 --> 49:19.568
Hold

49:20.744 --> 49:22.141
Catch

49:23.644 --> 49:24.166
Grenade

49:24.610 --> 49:25.906
Retreat

49:27.744 --> 49:28.539
Fall back

49:32.011 --> 49:32.602
Da Kui

49:32.711 --> 49:33.643
Find a way to the tomb

49:56.477 --> 49:57.443
Who is that

50:11.177 --> 50:12.007
Hold on tighter

50:12.110 --> 50:13.440
I can't take it anymore

50:13.544 --> 50:14.874
What to do

50:37.077 --> 50:38.009
lift it

50:41.477 --> 50:42.568
Master Three

50:42.677 --> 50:43.734
Go

51:41.544 --> 51:42.169
Not bad

51:42.477 --> 51:43.409
I know

52:13.143 --> 52:14.507
Fall back

52:20.510 --> 52:21.499
You stay

52:23.744 --> 52:24.733
Not now

52:42.010 --> 52:43.443
Let's go after them

52:43.544 --> 52:44.635
Hold

53:00.544 --> 53:01.772
What sneaky bastards

53:01.876 --> 53:03.536
This team is good

53:19.711 --> 53:20.734
Uncle Three

53:21.744 --> 53:22.868
Shtum

55:15.444 --> 55:16.569
Mr Hendrix

55:16.810 --> 55:18.538
I'm scanning the tomb now

55:47.077 --> 55:48.134
Guys let's go

55:48.444 --> 55:49.671
Yes Captain

56:21.843 --> 56:23.105
What is my name

56:25.210 --> 56:26.040
Wu Xie

56:27.177 --> 56:28.166
That's not too bad

56:30.577 --> 56:32.407
You don't have amnesia

56:37.943 --> 56:39.875
The divinely inspired bards

56:50.943 --> 56:51.932
My name is Zhang Qiling

57:57.210 --> 57:58.676
This should be it

58:23.776 --> 58:24.571
Help him

58:27.476 --> 58:28.136
Pull

58:30.576 --> 58:31.701
Look after him

58:31.977 --> 58:33.466
You little smart ass.
How come you're down here

58:33.776 --> 58:35.572
I saw a bunch of foreigners following your
footsteps

58:35.676 --> 58:36.938
I'm here to give you a warning

58:37.143 --> 58:38.666
Not bad, you little smart ass

58:38.776 --> 58:39.799
You're pretty sharp

58:40.910 --> 58:41.671
What

58:41.776 --> 58:43.072
Give me the key

58:43.609 --> 58:46.076
The key is safe with me

59:46.743 --> 59:47.709
Master Three

59:48.077 --> 59:49.509
I'm a bit scared

59:49.609 --> 59:53.008
You can't fear the ghosts
if you're a tomb raider

59:53.676 --> 59:54.540
This is the Tomb of the Snake Empress

59:54.643 --> 59:55.507
Is this your first time going down a tomb

59:55.710 --> 59:57.108
This is the forecourt

59:58.110 --> 59:59.076
The forecourt to receive guests

59:59.776 --> 01:00:02.640
Look at it. It looks
more like a funeral hall

01:00:29.743 --> 01:00:30.971
I'll record it

01:00:35.543 --> 01:00:37.067
I've never seen so many puppets

01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:39.005
These are wooden figures
to bury with the dead

01:00:39.143 --> 01:00:40.768
Ancient people used them in
ancestral sacrifices

01:00:41.043 --> 01:00:42.406
It's called puppet play

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:43.503
Look. It's lit on that side too

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.142
Master Three

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:53.409
This boy is good

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:54.839
Way it goes
Little Master Three knows What he's doing

01:01:54.943 --> 01:01:58.137
Not bad, you little smart ass

01:01:58.443 --> 01:01:59.876
It worked

01:02:01.043 --> 01:02:02.406
Record it

01:02:02.509 --> 01:02:03.805
Right

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.404
Master Three, look

01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:12.110
These are the guardian spirits

01:02:13.476 --> 01:02:16.841
This female one is rather good looking

01:02:20.943 --> 01:02:21.773
We're rich

01:02:21.876 --> 01:02:22.569
Look at that

01:02:22.676 --> 01:02:23.540
There are some more over here

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.676
This is nothing

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:26.503
Open the coffin

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.835
One, two, three

01:02:30.943 --> 01:02:32.534
One, two, three

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:36.638
One, two, three

01:02:37.776 --> 01:02:44.607
One, two, three

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:46.970
Hold on to it

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:51.398
It stinks

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:55.140
Down, put it down

01:02:57.443 --> 01:02:58.035
Watch your feet

01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:05.533
Fuck me. What a bundle

01:03:09.177 --> 01:03:11.007
But we can spend these things in a lifetime

01:03:11.476 --> 01:03:15.409
Do you want to see the one opposite

01:03:55.476 --> 01:03:56.670
Where is the corpse

01:03:58.543 --> 01:03:59.566
Master Three

01:03:59.676 --> 01:04:00.540
The corpse is gone

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:41.541
Cover your ears

01:04:41.743 --> 01:04:42.834
Lovely

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:45.107
What a lovely song

01:04:48.509 --> 01:04:49.441
Da Kui

01:04:49.543 --> 01:04:49.975
Zhong

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.069
Why are you following me around

01:05:23.176 --> 01:05:24.438
I told you I'm a grown man

01:05:25.076 --> 01:05:26.065
I'm not afraid of you

01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:37.735
Wu Sanxing

01:05:39.543 --> 01:05:42.033
Sorry I offended you

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:57.566
Didn't you say I'm beautiful

01:06:10.476 --> 01:06:11.499
Come out

01:06:11.609 --> 01:06:12.837
Don't mess around

01:06:13.443 --> 01:06:14.910
No more horseplay

01:06:44.643 --> 01:06:46.666
Do you want to kiss me

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:52.634
Let me go

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:54.038
Let me go

01:06:58.876 --> 01:06:59.740
What do you want

01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:11.440
Let me go

01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:12.668
Don't come after me

01:07:48.975 --> 01:07:50.408
What is going on

01:07:50.509 --> 01:07:51.475
Where are they

01:07:52.543 --> 01:07:53.703
Where is the lion

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.403
What happened

01:08:02.876 --> 01:08:03.966
This is called the song of the dead

01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:06.005
It's played by the puppets

01:08:06.509 --> 01:08:07.771
It will numb your senses

01:08:08.009 --> 01:08:09.567
and drive you insane

01:08:09.676 --> 01:08:11.903
How come you know it so well

01:08:12.609 --> 01:08:13.598
Have you been here before

01:08:14.643 --> 01:08:15.507
You're a mole

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.870
Zhong

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:18.837
Uncle Three

01:08:18.942 --> 01:08:19.773
Calm down

01:08:20.509 --> 01:08:21.906
We won't make it if we don't leave now

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:29.073
Hurry

01:09:19.643 --> 01:09:20.768
Be careful

01:09:43.743 --> 01:09:44.174
Be careful

01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:46.408
Help

01:09:52.676 --> 01:09:53.698
Swords

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:13.935
Is this the time

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:16.509
How can you still take pictures

01:10:16.609 --> 01:10:17.972
Uncle Three. Follow my rhythm

01:10:18.209 --> 01:10:20.141
One, two, three

01:10:20.743 --> 01:10:22.140
One, two, three

01:10:22.443 --> 01:10:23.840
Follow my ass

01:10:24.443 --> 01:10:25.739
Come help me

01:10:28.543 --> 01:10:32.407
One, two, three

01:10:32.509 --> 01:10:33.066
Pan Zi

01:10:33.443 --> 01:10:34.409
Follow my rhythm

01:10:34.509 --> 01:10:35.600
It's tiring me out

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.903
I can't do it anymore

01:10:38.009 --> 01:10:38.907
I'll go help them

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:44.570
One, two, duck

01:10:44.676 --> 01:10:48.108
One, two, duck

01:10:48.643 --> 01:10:50.541
Get ready for a turn

01:10:50.643 --> 01:10:52.166
One, two, duck

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.864
One, two, go

01:11:05.775 --> 01:11:06.469
Be careful

01:11:31.976 --> 01:11:33.443
Pan Zi, I'm scared

01:11:33.543 --> 01:11:35.009
You weren't scared when you saw the gold

01:11:35.109 --> 01:11:36.905
Master Three, how can we get out of here

01:11:37.443 --> 01:11:38.500
We can't get out

01:11:38.742 --> 01:11:40.004
We hide

01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:41.869
Look at this

01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:09.971
Uncle Three

01:12:30.376 --> 01:12:31.103
Oh my God

01:12:31.909 --> 01:12:35.035
How come there are so many skeletons
in this cage

01:12:37.109 --> 01:12:38.234
What word is this

01:12:41.742 --> 01:12:42.936
This word is pronounced Chai

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:46.174
It is made up of the words for ten thousand
and insects

01:12:46.376 --> 01:12:47.967
In ancient times, there was a punishment

01:12:48.142 --> 01:12:49.835
called Basin of Ten Thousand Insects

01:12:50.242 --> 01:12:51.799
They stripped off the clothes of a criminal

01:12:52.209 --> 01:12:53.641
Threw him into a ditch

01:12:53.976 --> 01:12:55.669
and let insects bite him

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.032
Master Three

01:13:03.109 --> 01:13:04.098
I'm sorry

01:13:06.809 --> 01:13:07.798
I quit

01:13:10.076 --> 01:13:10.974
Hey

01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:12.267
I quit

01:13:12.376 --> 01:13:15.308
Don't be like this It doesn't
matter how much you pay me, I quit

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:17.399
Let me go

01:13:22.209 --> 01:13:23.403
Brother Dan Dan

01:13:23.809 --> 01:13:24.173
Dan Dan

01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:26.933
Dan Dan

01:13:44.809 --> 01:13:45.934
Flesh-eating insects

01:14:14.443 --> 01:14:15.931
Help

01:14:16.675 --> 01:14:18.073
Help me

01:14:24.142 --> 01:14:25.302
Uncle Three, What are you doing

01:14:25.409 --> 01:14:27.102
Help him

01:14:45.076 --> 01:14:46.633
Uncle Three

01:14:51.176 --> 01:14:53.040
Uncle Three, help him

01:14:59.742 --> 01:15:00.208
Uncle Three

01:15:06.076 --> 01:15:07.803
Didn't you want to get down to a tomb

01:15:08.309 --> 01:15:10.332
This is bloody tomb raiding for you

01:15:35.142 --> 01:15:35.903
Get on the metal frames

01:15:36.009 --> 01:15:36.668
Go

01:15:36.775 --> 01:15:37.673
Go

01:15:49.343 --> 01:15:50.672
Hurry up

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:38.275
Little Master Three

01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:39.365
Give your hand to me

01:16:47.009 --> 01:16:47.770
Da Kui

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:49.103
What happened On your clothes

01:16:49.309 --> 01:16:50.934
It doesn't matter

01:16:51.042 --> 01:16:52.304
No, take a look

01:16:53.809 --> 01:16:54.775
Fuck me

01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:55.841
Pan Zi, give me your knife

01:16:56.775 --> 01:16:57.400
Catch

01:17:01.942 --> 01:17:02.703
Little Master Three

01:17:02.809 --> 01:17:05.242
Hurry up

01:17:08.076 --> 01:17:08.940
Little Master Three

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:10.940
I can't hold on anymore

01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:13.333
Be careful

01:18:17.842 --> 01:18:19.036
Nephew

01:18:19.142 --> 01:18:20.233
What a flute player you are

01:18:20.342 --> 01:18:21.934
Your flute has beaten thousands of insects

01:18:22.042 --> 01:18:23.405
That's so cool

01:18:24.176 --> 01:18:25.006
Go

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:39.808
God damn it

01:18:40.076 --> 01:18:41.133
Run

01:18:46.975 --> 01:18:47.736
Find the entrance

01:18:47.842 --> 01:18:49.365
Go I'll fight him to the death

01:18:53.009 --> 01:18:54.066
No, no grenade

01:18:54.408 --> 01:18:55.738
The key's inside

01:19:00.176 --> 01:19:01.642
Shtum

01:19:03.742 --> 01:19:05.072
My judgment tells me
that there's a gate here

01:19:05.342 --> 01:19:07.002
I'll find the trigger

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.108
Duck

01:19:08.375 --> 01:19:09.137
Smoke bomb

01:19:18.775 --> 01:19:19.866
We're running out of time

01:19:20.308 --> 01:19:21.331
There's no other way

01:19:21.442 --> 01:19:22.636
We can only dig a hole

01:19:24.842 --> 01:19:26.706
I have a better way

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:34.001
Is it ready yet

01:19:49.442 --> 01:19:50.272
Go

01:19:50.875 --> 01:19:52.238
Go

01:19:52.809 --> 01:19:53.707
Go

01:19:53.809 --> 01:19:55.673
Hurry up, catch

01:20:00.109 --> 01:20:00.734
Let's go

01:20:01.109 --> 01:20:01.802
I'll stick to the rear

01:20:02.109 --> 01:20:03.939
Then I'll catch up

01:20:07.175 --> 01:20:09.074
Ning, do not follow them

01:20:09.175 --> 01:20:11.938
Backtrack and take the
tunnel at your 3 o'clock

01:20:12.042 --> 01:20:13.269
and you will intercept them

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.341
Good

01:20:15.175 --> 01:20:15.835
Guys Move

01:20:16.809 --> 01:20:17.934
Come on. Run

01:20:43.175 --> 01:20:44.198
Wu Xie

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.303
Uncle Three and the guys Don't move

01:21:04.275 --> 01:21:05.400
I might not get out

01:21:07.675 --> 01:21:11.835
Right, I'll give you your memories

01:21:11.942 --> 01:21:12.737
Catch it

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:13.966
I told you not to move

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:20.175
I want you to hand it to me yourself

01:21:22.009 --> 01:21:22.873
Walk over slowly

01:21:24.308 --> 01:21:25.138
Come on

01:21:27.809 --> 01:21:28.798
I'll catch you

01:21:29.275 --> 01:21:30.207
Come

01:21:40.909 --> 01:21:44.136
I took a photo of you when you
were dozing off in the truck

01:21:44.275 --> 01:21:45.639
Can you not speak

01:21:46.108 --> 01:21:47.836
I speak when I'm nervous

01:21:51.175 --> 01:21:55.040
Give me your hand

01:22:19.009 --> 01:22:20.805
I don't regret coming down to this tomb

01:22:23.442 --> 01:22:24.237
Wu Xie

01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:37.038
Oh my God

01:22:37.442 --> 01:22:40.067
This looks like ancient
Persian architecture

01:22:48.275 --> 01:22:50.765
Fingers on the trigers, boys

01:23:15.775 --> 01:23:17.070
What are these things

01:23:18.675 --> 01:23:20.767
Is this the secret of Mu's tomb

01:23:21.175 --> 01:23:23.835
No, this is just the beginning

01:23:24.175 --> 01:23:25.300
Scan it

01:23:44.342 --> 01:23:45.740
That's plant cell

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.000
Sir, they're plant, not human

01:23:54.675 --> 01:23:56.334
Guys

01:23:56.742 --> 01:23:58.333
This armor is worth a lot

01:23:58.842 --> 01:24:00.831
They are all made of gold

01:24:08.175 --> 01:24:09.141
Position

01:24:11.342 --> 01:24:12.638
Don't shoot him

01:24:12.909 --> 01:24:14.739
Don't damage my sample

01:24:15.275 --> 01:24:17.298
No guns

01:24:17.408 --> 01:24:19.841
Shoot him

01:24:50.675 --> 01:24:51.334
No

01:25:10.141 --> 01:25:11.266
Go now

01:25:15.008 --> 01:25:16.202
Don't damage my sample

01:25:16.308 --> 01:25:18.240
No way, my people are dying

01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:19.068
No

01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:22.939
Reconnect me

01:26:06.308 --> 01:26:07.536
Heart

01:26:10.241 --> 01:26:11.537
Freeze

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:15.239
Little bastard

01:26:15.542 --> 01:26:17.565
Give me the key

01:26:17.675 --> 01:26:19.072
Or I'll kill you

01:26:21.275 --> 01:26:23.002
What are you laughing at

01:26:25.442 --> 01:26:26.567
Fatty

01:26:26.675 --> 01:26:27.902
Don't mess with me

01:26:28.108 --> 01:26:29.506
What age is this. You're
still using a knife

01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:31.638
Do you have a gun

01:26:32.041 --> 01:26:33.030
To come tomb raiding

01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:34.164
How can I not bring a gun

01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:37.068
I don't believe you

01:26:37.208 --> 01:26:38.003
Try me

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:45.503
Are you scared

01:26:45.675 --> 01:26:47.539
Goddamn Fatty

01:26:47.941 --> 01:26:50.306
Tried to bluff with me with a knife

01:27:11.475 --> 01:27:12.907
Don't you have a gun

01:27:13.008 --> 01:27:14.236
I don't have a gun

01:27:14.342 --> 01:27:15.308
Damn

01:27:17.575 --> 01:27:18.405
Let's help him

01:27:18.508 --> 01:27:19.497
We have to

01:27:20.175 --> 01:27:21.073
Damn

01:27:21.175 --> 01:27:22.403
How come it's so heavy

01:27:24.575 --> 01:27:26.939
I got it

01:27:28.141 --> 01:27:29.437
I'm exhausted

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:33.007
Damn Fatty

01:27:33.141 --> 01:27:34.369
Little friend, I'll see you later

01:27:37.342 --> 01:27:38.536
That is a fake

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:43.531
Here

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:48.898
My neck

01:27:49.008 --> 01:27:50.906
Master

01:27:51.008 --> 01:27:51.906
Shtum

01:28:01.375 --> 01:28:02.102
Damn Fatty

01:28:03.141 --> 01:28:04.369
The key is here

01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:07.406
Boss

01:28:07.575 --> 01:28:09.371
Boss, wait for me

01:28:10.642 --> 01:28:11.937
Get out of the way

01:28:18.241 --> 01:28:19.298
100m, turn left

01:28:19.408 --> 01:28:20.272
Next tunnel

01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:22.273
There's something waiting for me

01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:15.064
Hendrix

01:29:15.175 --> 01:29:17.141
What the hell are we really after

01:29:21.008 --> 01:29:21.600
Boss

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:24.139
Don't ask him anymore

01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:25.605
He's not going to tell you

01:29:26.542 --> 01:29:27.406
There's no time

01:29:27.975 --> 01:29:28.601
Give me the key

01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:30.235
Don't try me

01:29:30.342 --> 01:29:31.103
Ning

01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:32.436
He's an old friend

01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:35.004
I want to talk to him

01:29:48.408 --> 01:29:50.931
Have you find yourself now

01:29:51.175 --> 01:29:52.505
No

01:29:52.641 --> 01:29:56.131
But I know I'm your opposite

01:29:56.508 --> 01:29:59.236
You suffer from fear of aging

01:29:59.542 --> 01:30:03.031
Whereas I suffer from never being able to

01:30:03.141 --> 01:30:09.040
So you've discovered the
secret of immotality

01:30:09.141 --> 01:30:10.005
No

01:30:10.308 --> 01:30:12.274
The countdown is ending

01:30:12.408 --> 01:30:15.397
It is the last chance to open the Tomb

01:30:15.975 --> 01:30:17.203
What is he after anyway

01:30:17.674 --> 01:30:19.266
What are you trying to destroy

01:30:27.542 --> 01:30:30.065
50 years ago

01:30:30.308 --> 01:30:34.434
I bought these 23 divine pieces

01:30:34.574 --> 01:30:39.303
and they hold the secret discovered by
Iron Mask

01:30:41.275 --> 01:30:42.173
I found that

01:30:42.275 --> 01:30:45.969
the Empress's Witchcraft is to

01:30:46.075 --> 01:30:49.508
turn human beings into trees that live to a
thousand years

01:30:50.475 --> 01:30:52.964
She took the essence of the magical tree

01:30:53.241 --> 01:30:55.639
and transfered it into King Xiang's body

01:30:55.941 --> 01:30:57.907
to turn it into worms

01:30:58.208 --> 01:31:01.436
She also created an immortal army

01:31:01.708 --> 01:31:05.902
To be released when the seven stars
converge again

01:31:06.974 --> 01:31:09.906
I will be back

01:31:10.241 --> 01:31:12.230
If she succeeded

01:31:12.574 --> 01:31:16.371
It would be a catastrophe for mankind

01:31:17.141 --> 01:31:19.937
You want us to bring this crap to you

01:31:24.008 --> 01:31:26.667
You have let your obsession take over you

01:31:27.574 --> 01:31:28.665
Okay

01:31:30.574 --> 01:31:37.440
There's a path on your right which leads
straight to Mu' coffin

01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:39.167
and they will all die

01:31:39.475 --> 01:31:41.100
Will you lead them out

01:31:42.375 --> 01:31:47.240
or will you let your obsession lead them to
their deaths

01:31:51.941 --> 01:31:53.237
It's hard to decide

01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:54.933
Since I've been in this business

01:31:55.375 --> 01:31:56.636
I've never met a mission
I couldn't complete

01:31:57.108 --> 01:31:59.404
No matter it's for money or faith

01:31:59.541 --> 01:32:01.201
We're destined to go together

01:32:03.308 --> 01:32:04.274
You stay

01:32:05.141 --> 01:32:06.504
So you stay

01:32:08.442 --> 01:32:09.566
I stay

01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:15.530
Are you talking about
opening the Mu's coffin

01:32:17.108 --> 01:32:19.370
I've never met a riddle I can't solve

01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:23.165
I have to see it for myself

01:34:56.474 --> 01:34:57.998
You've seen the Empress's secret

01:34:58.208 --> 01:34:59.571
You go back first

01:34:59.674 --> 01:35:01.640
I'll handle the rest

01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:02.998
No

01:35:03.108 --> 01:35:04.596
I said I'd take care of you

01:36:28.374 --> 01:36:30.363
You've overestimated your abilities

01:36:30.474 --> 01:36:32.032
How dare you interrupt our eternal lives

01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:34.439
You are not human nor trees

01:36:34.541 --> 01:36:36.099
I have to carry out a divine will

01:37:55.574 --> 01:37:56.335
Yeah

01:38:42.607 --> 01:38:44.073
It's the Snake Empress of Tamutuo

01:38:44.374 --> 01:38:46.500
The designer of this catastrophe

01:39:17.207 --> 01:39:19.469
Humans are a lowly life form

01:39:19.574 --> 01:39:21.939
But the worms that I bred

01:39:22.407 --> 01:39:25.203
are about to change this world

01:40:09.541 --> 01:40:11.132
Uncle Three

01:40:12.674 --> 01:40:14.071
Nephew

01:40:14.474 --> 01:40:15.201
Boss

01:40:15.307 --> 01:40:16.000
Look

01:40:19.107 --> 01:40:20.039
Harry

01:40:20.607 --> 01:40:22.334
Captain

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:48.132
Shtum

01:41:01.207 --> 01:41:01.934
Old Man

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.006
Don't go

01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:08.232
What the hell are they

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:28.666
Let's go

01:41:46.374 --> 01:41:47.999
Where the hell are they going

01:41:59.674 --> 01:42:01.037
Don't drag me

01:42:08.174 --> 01:42:09.504
Don't drag me

01:42:16.973 --> 01:42:17.565
You let me go

01:42:17.674 --> 01:42:19.663
You bloody let go first

01:42:23.441 --> 01:42:24.430
Don't bite me

01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.634
Stab him with your knife

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.070
Stab him

01:42:39.641 --> 01:42:41.129
Hurry Stab him

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.035
Okay

01:42:42.973 --> 01:42:44.030
Stab him in the heart

01:42:58.607 --> 01:42:59.970
Move move

01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:01.302
Come on, come on

01:43:05.474 --> 01:43:06.599
Harry

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:08.502
Go

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.507
Chew on this

01:43:38.474 --> 01:43:39.463
Don't

01:43:39.974 --> 01:43:41.338
Don't come over. Go away

01:43:44.007 --> 01:43:45.132
Da Kui

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:51.236
Da Kui

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.963
If I totally lost myself one day

01:44:29.274 --> 01:44:31.240
There's still someone
who would remember me

01:44:31.507 --> 01:44:32.734
Of course I'd remember you

01:44:32.973 --> 01:44:34.735
I only want one thing from you

01:44:38.274 --> 01:44:39.570
When you return

01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:41.430
I'll give it to you

01:45:58.707 --> 01:45:59.935
It's a magnetic field

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.302
We have to think about retreating

01:46:01.407 --> 01:46:02.930
What should we do

01:46:17.407 --> 01:46:17.929
What

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:19.473
Flute

01:46:29.474 --> 01:46:32.338
I can let you have a taste

01:46:32.441 --> 01:46:35.600
of the joy of eternal life

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.506
What are we going to do

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.298
Mr Hendrix

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.563
I know you see all this

01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.531
If these worms break out

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.504
That will be the end of mankind

01:48:35.974 --> 01:48:38.668
But I know you can help us defeat them

01:48:39.573 --> 01:48:42.505
You want me to defeat my entire life's plan

01:48:46.307 --> 01:48:50.433
I think you can achieve something else

01:48:51.407 --> 01:48:52.839
What would that be

01:48:55.773 --> 01:48:57.433
A true hero

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:16.497
The sorceress relies on the magnetic power
for protection

01:49:17.007 --> 01:49:18.700
Destroy the lava pipe

01:49:18.807 --> 01:49:21.274
And the heat will destroy
her magnetic shield

01:49:21.773 --> 01:49:22.864
Thank you sir

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:25.530
I've already discovered the secret

01:49:25.873 --> 01:49:27.703
And What difference does it make

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.429
You know you can't do it

01:49:30.707 --> 01:49:31.730
Alone

01:49:32.473 --> 01:49:34.236
He is not alone

01:49:34.506 --> 01:49:35.495
Ning

01:49:35.974 --> 01:49:39.736
I hope you can accept my next offer

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.465
There's something I want to ask you first

01:49:42.873 --> 01:49:44.362
How much

01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:48.303
If it's right or wrong

01:49:49.341 --> 01:49:50.898
Ning, let's split

01:49:51.341 --> 01:49:53.330
Give me the key.
How about me?

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.634
This mission is too perilous

01:49:54.773 --> 01:49:55.568
No

01:49:55.673 --> 01:49:57.333
Even though I'm just a lowly interpreter

01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.271
I'm still a member of your team

01:49:59.406 --> 01:50:00.736
You have to take this out

01:50:00.907 --> 01:50:02.873
This is a testament to the most
important day of our lives

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:12.906
My name is Wang

01:50:13.007 --> 01:50:14.337
Fatty Wang

01:50:18.007 --> 01:50:19.337
My partner

01:50:25.506 --> 01:50:26.472
Okay

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:30.873
I swear to you

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.006
I'll complete this mission

01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:51.329
Help me break this chain

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.600
I'm going to ride that Wheel to help Shtum

01:50:58.573 --> 01:50:59.505
One

01:51:01.274 --> 01:51:02.467
Two

01:51:02.573 --> 01:51:03.334
Three

01:51:22.773 --> 01:51:23.830
You be careful

01:51:24.274 --> 01:51:25.364
No problem

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:38.271
Shtum

01:51:38.373 --> 01:51:40.396
I'll come and rescue you very soon

01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:45.735
Fuck me

01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:50.335
Uncle Three

01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.431
Duck

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:54.929
Go to hell

01:51:58.506 --> 01:51:59.438
Uncle Three

01:52:00.373 --> 01:52:02.238
You have to disengage the pipes down below

01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:02.829
What

01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:03.963
You're still thinking of dismantling things

01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.964
In order to restore, we have to dismantle

01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:09.302
After you bomb the lava pipe

01:52:09.406 --> 01:52:10.531
Smash the Wheel

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:12.436
And the chain will lead you out

01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:13.700
Set it for 30

01:52:13.807 --> 01:52:14.967
Good luck

01:52:31.673 --> 01:52:32.571
Hello

01:52:32.973 --> 01:52:33.939
Hello

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.965
Give it to me

01:52:46.306 --> 01:52:46.966
This

01:52:47.773 --> 01:52:48.466
You

01:52:50.907 --> 01:52:51.896
30 seconds

01:52:52.007 --> 01:52:53.598
OK? Partner

01:52:55.273 --> 01:52:55.762
OK

01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:09.500
I have a way

01:53:10.373 --> 01:53:11.396
Zhong

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.438
Zhong

01:53:18.273 --> 01:53:19.671
Zhong, What the hell are you doing

01:53:20.673 --> 01:53:22.003
How can we, the Nine Families

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.299
lose to foreigners

01:53:24.473 --> 01:53:26.439
You're being silly

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:24.965
Give me your hand

01:55:41.406 --> 01:55:42.395
Look

01:55:42.807 --> 01:55:44.432
I said I'd take care of you

01:55:45.707 --> 01:55:46.867
I learned some truth

01:55:47.773 --> 01:55:49.296
from you

01:55:51.007 --> 01:55:52.564
Memories aren't everything

01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.902
Daring to imagine

01:55:55.406 --> 01:55:56.463
is What everything is all about

01:55:56.907 --> 01:55:58.839
Then you don't regret having me as a friend

01:56:03.473 --> 01:56:05.371
I regret not locking you
in the truck myself

01:56:05.573 --> 01:56:06.562
It's time for you to go

01:56:07.007 --> 01:56:08.769
My mission hasn't been completed yet

01:56:09.807 --> 01:56:10.773
Shtum

01:56:15.473 --> 01:56:16.701
Wu Xie

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.863
We have to go

01:56:24.273 --> 01:56:25.398
Shtum

01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:41.534
We won't make it if we don't leave now

01:56:42.373 --> 01:56:43.237
Don't

01:56:49.306 --> 01:56:50.466
Shtum

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:12.370
I will be back

01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:00.734
People like me

01:58:00.972 --> 01:58:02.564
After a period of time

01:58:02.972 --> 01:58:04.803
Would forget the memories of the past

01:58:04.906 --> 01:58:05.895
Don't worry

01:58:06.006 --> 01:58:07.938
I'll record for you with my camera

01:58:09.807 --> 01:58:10.897
This is for you

01:58:27.872 --> 01:58:36.295
We don't seek smoke and mirrors

01:58:36.406 --> 01:58:46.295
Looking back at the time
when the Wise man rises

01:58:46.473 --> 01:58:57.430
It was a time of innocence and purity

02:00:01.473 --> 02:00:04.599
This should be a story about me and him

02:00:05.707 --> 02:00:07.673
Whether he should tell the story about me

02:00:07.772 --> 02:00:09.569
Or me about him

02:00:12.273 --> 02:00:14.239
When did it all start?

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.806
How did it end?

02:00:16.305 --> 02:00:22.493
