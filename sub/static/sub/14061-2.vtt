00:00.001 --> 00:02.935
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on when calls the heart...</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:04.970
Charles? It's so wonderful
to see you again.

00:04.972 --> 00:06.038
You as well.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.039
Is there
something wrong?

00:07.041 --> 00:08.340
You tell me, mr. Avery.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.341
What happened to bill?

00:09.343 --> 00:10.542
He's married, with a child.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.543
Tom thornton,

00:11.545 --> 00:12.644
At your service.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.679
Will we be
seeing you again?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.114
No, I'm leaving hamilton
in the morning.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.697
Jack!

00:31.699 --> 00:33.999
How was the big city?

00:34.001 --> 00:35.401
A change of pace.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.502
Well, I'm sure

00:36.504 --> 00:37.936
You and elizabeth
are glad--

00:37.938 --> 00:39.238
Oh--

00:40.740 --> 00:42.641
Pardon me.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.913
No elizabeth?

00:47.915 --> 00:50.516
Her mother's
still not doing well.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.617
I'm so sorry.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.285
What does her doctor say?
Will she recover?

00:53.287 --> 00:55.687
Well, it's too soon to know.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.889
I'll keep her in my prayers.

00:56.891 --> 00:57.990
And elizabeth, too.

01:02.195 --> 01:05.397
Lots of changes
since the trial.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.398
All for the best.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.800
And a new name, too.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.201
Hope valley.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.704
Hope valley.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.107
It fits.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.278
Maybe this isn't
a good time

01:19.280 --> 01:20.312
To bring this up,

01:20.314 --> 01:21.914
But school's
about to start,

01:21.916 --> 01:25.784
And if elizabeth isn't
going to return,

01:25.786 --> 01:27.086
Well then, we'll need
to find a new teacher.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.554
You're right.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.022
This isn't a good time
to bring it up.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.929
Remember this?

01:36.931 --> 01:39.131
How could I forget?

01:39.133 --> 01:41.500
It took you
half an hour to carve,

01:41.502 --> 01:43.235
And you nearly
cut off your thumb.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.571
I was only nine at the time.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.439
And very impressive.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.308
Especially when you said,

01:49.310 --> 01:51.143
"as long as
these letters endure,

01:51.145 --> 01:52.111
So shall our friendship."

01:52.113 --> 01:53.112
I said that?

01:53.114 --> 01:54.413
Mm-hmm.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.582
What a poet I was.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.950
And a prophet.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.852
Here we are,
after all these years.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.820
Some things are meant
to endure.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.956
Still the poet.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.824
But even better.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.926
I still have my thumb.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.361
[laughing]

02:09.363 --> 02:10.662
Charles!

02:15.502 --> 02:17.236
[â™ª]

02:42.228 --> 02:44.530
Mother, did dr. Clement
leave already?

02:44.532 --> 02:45.964
Yes, it was a short visit.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.466
What did he say?

02:47.468 --> 02:49.134
The same as always.

02:49.136 --> 02:52.538
Make sure I take my medication
and get plenty of rest.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.806
Honestly, I don't know why
I even bother with that man.

02:56.209 --> 02:58.010
I should help you to your room.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.144
Oh, no, I'm fine, darling.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.846
I'd like to stay and read
a while longer.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.982
Well, is there anything
I can do for you?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.083
As a matter of fact,
there is.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.085
Cecile kensington
is chairing an event

03:07.087 --> 03:08.320
For the charity league,

03:08.322 --> 03:09.321
And I promised I would help.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.889
If you could--

03:10.891 --> 03:11.823
Take a basket to the shelter?

03:11.825 --> 03:12.925
Mm-hmm.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.494
Charles already
volunteered to drive me.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.396
He is such a dear.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.165
To say nothing of the fact
that he is quite handsome.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.601
And comes from
a wonderful family.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.403
Goodness, mother,
if I didn't know any better,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.238
I might think father had
something to worry about.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.007
How you tease your mother...

03:29.009 --> 03:31.243
[laughing]

03:31.245 --> 03:34.179
Fellows, fellows, please.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.782
Look, I can't make
any guarantees,

03:36.784 --> 03:39.718
But my goal is to find jobs

03:39.720 --> 03:41.753
For each and every one of you.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.021
My trade is mining.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.856
I don't know the first thing
about timber.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.225
Well, we'll train you then.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.893
As soon as the mill
is up and running,

03:47.895 --> 03:49.861
Any one of you fellows who used
to work for the mining company

03:49.863 --> 03:51.930
Will get first crack
at any job

03:51.932 --> 03:53.298
My foremen can teach you to do.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.533
All right?

03:54.535 --> 03:57.603
Tell that to these fellows.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.371
We've got a right to work
for a day's wage, same as you.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.374
Okay, fellows,
take it easy.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.444
Everyone here is going
to get a fair chance.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.045
Now, form a line.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.213
Single file.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.616
Any arguing, you go
straight to the back.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.424
I appreciate
the help, constable.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.592
Just doing my job.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.560
Leland coulter.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.061
Lee,

04:23.063 --> 04:24.229
And if there's anything I can do
to return the favor,

04:24.231 --> 04:25.797
Please let me know.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.898
Actually, I could use a hand

04:26.900 --> 04:28.166
Getting the church
building finished.

04:28.168 --> 04:29.601
The school term starts soon.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.937
So if you could spare
a few men, I'd be grateful.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.005
Done.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.273
And I'll be there myself.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.108
I like your attitude.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.576
Well, thank you.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.910
I came to hope valley
to make a profit,

04:38.912 --> 04:40.312
But if I can,

04:40.314 --> 04:41.780
I'd like to
make a difference, too.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.315
Fair enough.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.851
Let's go, young man.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.190
I think you should
wear your hair up.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.325
And I just bought
a splendid new hat

04:53.327 --> 04:54.593
I can lend you.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.295
Julie, please.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.297
I'm just going to drop off
a charity basket with charles,

04:58.299 --> 05:00.299
Not attend a society ball.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.533
It must be so exciting

05:01.535 --> 05:04.269
To have two men
pining over you.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.671
I don't know where you get
these crazy notions.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.006
No one is pining over me.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.608
You kissed jack,

05:09.610 --> 05:10.842
And I'm sure
if you gave charles

05:10.844 --> 05:12.444
The least bit
of encouragement...

05:12.446 --> 05:16.181
Don't you have anything
more important to think about?

05:16.183 --> 05:18.216
Well, as a matter of fact,
I do.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.686
I received a letter
from an admirer.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.020
Would you like to know
who it is?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.055
No, but I suppose

05:23.057 --> 05:24.489
You're going
to tell me anyway.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.691
Tom thornton.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.660
He says he'd like
to see me.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.662
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.197
Why not?

05:32.199 --> 05:33.732
Because he's dangerous?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.934
You don't know
anything about him.

05:37.370 --> 05:41.707
I think he's just...
Misunderstood.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.342
And I suppose
mr. Tolliver,

05:43.344 --> 05:44.409
Who robbed a bank

05:44.411 --> 05:45.744
And held you hostage
at gunpoint

05:45.746 --> 05:47.379
Was also
"just misunderstood"?

05:47.381 --> 05:48.347
Well, that was different.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.848
This is jack's brother.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.917
Yes, and he's also the
black sheep of the family.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.686
He said so himself.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.221
Don't you want me to be happy?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.522
Of course I do,

05:57.524 --> 05:58.990
But there are
a lot of other men out there

05:58.992 --> 06:00.692
Who will make you happy
besides tom.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.994
I can't imagine who.

06:04.731 --> 06:10.202
Please, promise me
you won't see him.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.404
Just think.

06:12.406 --> 06:16.174
If I were to marry tom,
and you were to marry jack,

06:16.176 --> 06:19.644
Well, we'd be sisters-in-law
as well as sisters.

06:21.347 --> 06:22.748
Now then,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.283
Just make sure you check in
on mother while I'm out.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.619
Are you sure
I can't go with you?

06:27.621 --> 06:28.687
[sighs]

06:28.689 --> 06:30.722
How about this...

06:30.724 --> 06:32.224
Once father gets home,

06:32.226 --> 06:35.260
You and I can go into town
for a concert at st. James hall.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.062
Could we?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.598
Oh, that would be
completely divine.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.733
I just love musicians,
don't you?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.868
They're so...

06:42.870 --> 06:44.936
Bohemian.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.605
I better find something to wear.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.407
Something avant-garde.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.442
Ooh! Maybe a head scarf!

06:51.878 --> 06:53.745
Where is she going?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.113
To marry a musician.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.782
Bite your tongue.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.921
You know, it's really
so much nicer

07:02.923 --> 07:05.924
When you put the napkin
in the glass

07:05.926 --> 07:07.659
Like a fan.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.927
Voila.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.463
[chuckling]

07:11.465 --> 07:13.098
Rosemary, I really appreciate
you volunteering to help,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.902
But I hate to impose
on your time like this.

07:16.904 --> 07:17.969
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.171
I know how busy you are

07:19.173 --> 07:20.305
With all
the new workers in town.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.773
[gasps]

07:21.775 --> 07:23.341
And I was thinking today
we should make corn muffins

07:23.343 --> 07:24.409
Instead of biscuits.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.477
But we should
charge more.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.611
They're really
so much better than--

07:26.613 --> 07:27.846
Than what?

07:27.848 --> 07:30.449
Than the run of the mill
biscuits served...

07:30.451 --> 07:33.218
By other people.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.021
Oh, constable,

07:36.023 --> 07:37.789
We're not
actually open yet.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.024
Thank you, rosemary,

07:39.026 --> 07:42.093
But I'm here
on a personal matter.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.795
I'll start the oven.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.197
Don't mind me.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.769
I wanted to let you know
I received a telegram.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.637
There's a criminal
investigation back east,

07:52.639 --> 07:54.439
And the mounties need an expert.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.274
And I suppose
that expert is you.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.442
I won't be gone long.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.110
Just a week or so.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.612
Well, you know what they say,

08:00.614 --> 08:03.014
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.349
[chuckles]

08:04.351 --> 08:06.818
Well, are we talking about
your heart or mine?

08:06.820 --> 08:11.089
A little of both, I hope.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.327
The stage is due
in less than an hour.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.396
I don't believe in
saying goodbye anymore.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.298
Good.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.134
Then let's leave it at this.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.207
Abigail!

08:29.209 --> 08:30.141
Where do you keep
your baking so--

08:30.143 --> 08:31.376
Oh.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.844
Never mind,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.312
Ooh, found it!

08:34.314 --> 08:35.347
Right here.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.782
Under my nose all along.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.087
Ooh, I like the looks
of this place.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.589
New buildings and fresh paint

08:44.591 --> 08:46.691
Mean cash in people's pockets.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.060
And cash in people's pockets
means cash in our pockets,

08:49.062 --> 08:51.029
And to that I say...

08:51.031 --> 08:52.063
"amen."

08:52.065 --> 08:53.732
Not the bibles again.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.767
A man can make a good living
selling bibles.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.102
Especially when he never
places the order.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.203
Exactly

08:58.205 --> 09:00.739
Give me a hand
with that case.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.946
Would you be
more careful with those?

09:09.782 --> 09:11.016
Oh!

09:11.018 --> 09:11.950
Oh, thank heavens

09:11.952 --> 09:13.685
You're here.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.120
Ma'am?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.187
We received your telegram,

09:16.189 --> 09:17.622
But with the flood
near union city

09:17.624 --> 09:19.724
We had no idea
when you'd arrive.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.693
You heard we were coming here?

09:21.695 --> 09:22.794
Of course.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.629
And we're so glad
you were available.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.798
Reverend anderson had to
leave town quickly.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.267
I'm afraid he left us
high and dry...

09:29.269 --> 09:32.070
In the spiritual sense, that is.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.105
[chuckles awkwardly]

09:34.107 --> 09:36.141
Oh, constable thornton,
look who's arrived.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.811
Our new pastor,
frank hogan.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.780
Nice to meet you, reverend.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.249
A pleasure.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.318
And he's brought bibles
for our church.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
I never go anywhere
without the good book.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.754
Oh.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.258
Now, I'm afraid the parsonage
isn't ready yet,

09:53.260 --> 09:55.594
So you will have to stay
in the boarding house

09:55.596 --> 09:56.962
Over the saloon.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.432
Yes, unfortunately,
the church isn't ready either.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.499
Don't worry about us.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.401
We're just humble folks
of the cloth.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.470
Look, as
the good book says,

10:05.472 --> 10:07.672
Rome wasn't built
in a day.

10:10.576 --> 10:11.977
I'm paraphrasing,
of course.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.845
[laughs]

10:13.847 --> 10:15.847
What my daddy
means to say is,

10:15.849 --> 10:17.115
Who needs a building

10:17.117 --> 10:19.117
When it's what's in here
that counts.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.485
Oh, what a lovely girl.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.453
What's your name, dear?

10:21.455 --> 10:22.787
Annabelle.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.589
After the saint.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.192
I didn't know there was
a saint annabelle.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.927
What she means to say

10:28.929 --> 10:32.864
Is that she was named after
her saintly mother,

10:32.866 --> 10:36.701
God rest her soul.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.911
Well, it seems you're
making yourself comfortable.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.783
Oh, do come in.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.718
Well, I bought up
about half the town

10:53.720 --> 10:57.122
When your bosses
pulled up stakes,

10:57.124 --> 10:58.390
Including everything
you see in this room

10:58.392 --> 10:59.624
That used to be
in your office,

10:59.626 --> 11:01.660
If I'm not mistaken.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.228
But you're not here to talk
about the good old days,

11:03.230 --> 11:04.496
Are you?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.332
Let's talk about
doing business together.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.336
Yeah, I never was quite sure
what you meant by that.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.305
No one knows this valley
the way that I do.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.573
It would seem to me

11:15.575 --> 11:19.511
That you could use
a consultant on your payroll

11:19.513 --> 11:22.480
Just to make sure
that things run...

11:22.482 --> 11:24.015
Smoothly.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.752
Here's how I see things.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.021
The mining company
is out of business,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.156
Done,

11:31.158 --> 11:32.824
And pretty much
everybody in town,

11:32.826 --> 11:35.260
Right down to constable
thornton's bloodhound,

11:35.262 --> 11:37.896
Seems to think that you're worse
than the devil himself.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.265
No offense, mr. Gowen,

11:40.267 --> 11:42.434
But no,

11:42.436 --> 11:45.003
I don't want you
anywhere near me.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.173
You don't want me
as an enemy, either.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.309
I'm prepared
to take my chances.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.946
Suit yourself.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.593
Maybe you could be a little
more careful next time.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.729
Accidents happen.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.598
I'd keep that in mind,
if I were you.

12:19.205 --> 12:22.140
This is quite generous,
mrs. Thatcher.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.075
My mother will be
very grateful.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.810
Please give her my best.

12:25.812 --> 12:26.878
I would take it myself,

12:26.880 --> 12:28.480
But that charlatan of a doctor

12:28.482 --> 12:31.216
Has forbidden me
from leaving the house.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.985
I'm sorry to hear
he hasn't been more helpful.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.554
I hope you don't
find this presumptuous,

12:36.556 --> 12:37.889
But I have an acquaintance
from university

12:37.891 --> 12:39.724
Who is considered
a brilliant physician.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.659
I was wondering
if a second medical opinion

12:41.661 --> 12:43.495
Might be advisable?

12:43.497 --> 12:46.131
Well, I wouldn't want
to impose.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.665
I think it's
a wonderful idea,

12:47.667 --> 12:49.067
If it isn't
too much to ask.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.235
Not at all.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.936
I'll call him
right away.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.605
You are too kind.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.273
Charles!

12:55.275 --> 12:56.508
How nice to see you.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.309
Viola.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.344
I haven't
noticed you

12:59.346 --> 13:01.479
At any of the
social events lately.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.580
Sir lionel and I
were just saying

13:02.582 --> 13:03.581
That we're worried
you've given up

13:03.583 --> 13:04.916
On the pleasures
of society.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.751
I'm afraid

13:06.753 --> 13:08.853
I've been a bit
consumed by work lately.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.155
We're having
dinner

13:10.157 --> 13:11.756
At the regency
on Sunday.

13:11.758 --> 13:14.359
Perhaps you and
elizabeth can join us.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.194
Please don't
feel obliged.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.862
I know you're
very busy with work.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.465
In fact, I just
happen to be free.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.066
What a happy
coincidence.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.637
Are you sure there
isn't anything

13:25.639 --> 13:27.472
You need from us
before we go?

13:27.474 --> 13:28.773
No.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.308
I have julie
to take care of me.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.442
Just shoo, all of you.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.677
[laughs]

13:36.215 --> 13:37.382
Isn't that the scarf

13:37.384 --> 13:40.785
I gave you
on your birthday?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.720
Now, how did that
get in there?

13:42.722 --> 13:43.822
Is that
your way of saying

13:43.824 --> 13:45.123
That you didn't like it?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.559
This is
my way of saying,

13:47.561 --> 13:48.960
I like it so much,

13:48.962 --> 13:50.862
I want to share it
with someone in need.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.600
Make sure you get
those boards flush.

13:56.735 --> 13:59.804
Travis, careful not to
make it too narrow.

13:59.806 --> 14:00.805
Lee!

14:00.807 --> 14:02.173
Yeah.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.209
I can't thank you enough
for loaning out your men.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.543
Happy to help.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.412
New pastor
needs a church.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.847
The kids deserve
a real school, right?

14:08.849 --> 14:10.048
-Right.
-Okay.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.224
Where do you want
this stuff, jack?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.358
Just lay it over there.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.926
Okay.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.064
So, jack,

14:26.066 --> 14:28.166
If that's all
for today,

14:28.168 --> 14:29.701
I'll see you
back here tomorrow.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.236
Okay?

14:33.739 --> 14:34.772
How are you today, mary?

14:36.342 --> 14:37.909
Ah, that boy

14:37.911 --> 14:40.011
Is a goner.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.180
He is head over heels
in love with a woman.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.951
Just like you.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.387
Now, where would you get
an idea like that?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.455
From everyone in town,

14:50.457 --> 14:51.789
Saying this is why

14:51.791 --> 14:53.691
You were spending
your reward money,

14:53.693 --> 14:54.759
And now your time,

14:54.761 --> 14:57.562
Building this place.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.397
Education is important
for the future of hope valley.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.865
Really.

15:00.867 --> 15:04.702
You may be sellin', young man,
but I'm not buyin'.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.704
Not buyin'.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.773
Good story, though.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.745
Three orders
of roasted chicken

15:13.747 --> 15:15.380
And mashed potatoes.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.882
I hope you saved me
a piece of that apple pie.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.751
I'm afraid we just ran out.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.119
Makes no never mind.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.454
The only dessert a fella needs
is an eyeful of you.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.455
Don't you be
getting fresh

15:24.457 --> 15:25.390
With mrs. Stanton.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.494
Maybe you should mind
your own business.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.695
It is my business.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.598
No!

15:33.600 --> 15:36.534
Don't you dare.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.673
[sighs in disgust]

15:47.646 --> 15:48.913
All right, boys, listen up.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.648
I don't know where
you left your manners,

15:50.650 --> 15:52.784
But when you're in my cafe,
you will act like gentlemen.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.018
So the first thing
you're going to do

15:54.020 --> 15:55.320
Is take your sidearms

15:55.322 --> 15:57.655
And leave them
at the front door.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.224
Come on, now,
let's get going.

16:02.094 --> 16:04.629
And from now on,
when you're in my cafe,

16:04.631 --> 16:05.863
You will say
please and thank you,

16:05.865 --> 16:07.098
Like it's Sunday supper.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.600
And if you don't,
you will go home hungry.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.269
Now, have I made myself clear?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.471
Yes, ma'am.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.939
Very good.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.040
Say grace

16:16.042 --> 16:19.110
And eat up before
your dinner gets cold.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.946
So, if I understand
what you're saying,

16:21.948 --> 16:23.548
It's the pills
that are the problem

16:23.550 --> 16:24.649
And not her heart?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.884
Her fainting spells
began last January,

16:26.886 --> 16:29.187
When she started taking
the medication.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.222
It's more than
mere coincidence.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.124
But dr. Clement
gave her those pills

16:33.126 --> 16:34.492
To help her.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.693
Usually,
they do help.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.128
However, in rare cases,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.397
They cause a severe drop
in blood pressure--

16:39.399 --> 16:41.366
Which causes
the fainting spells.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.633
Precisely.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.635
I'm going to switch her
to a different medicine.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.904
She'll be on the mend
before you know it.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.541
Dr. Lyden,
I am so grateful that you came.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.642
Think nothing of it.

16:51.644 --> 16:55.246
And please, ring me
if you need anything.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.949
I'll wait in the car.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.085
How can I ever thank you

17:01.087 --> 17:03.087
For all you've done
for my family?

17:04.757 --> 17:05.990
Let's have dinner tonight.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.492
Just the two of us.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.861
I would love that,
really, I would,

17:09.863 --> 17:11.929
But I should probably stay here,
just in case.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.232
Father isn't due
until the morning,

17:14.234 --> 17:17.201
And julie and viola
are calling on the wellingtons.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.104
Then...

17:20.106 --> 17:22.073
We'll picnic right here
on the floor.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.375
But a formal picnic.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.943
White tie, of course.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.045
[laughs]

17:27.047 --> 17:28.713
What will the servants think?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.348
That we're two old friends

17:30.350 --> 17:34.185
Who don't care at all about
what anyone else has to say.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.887
[chuckles]

17:35.889 --> 17:37.488
Hmm.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.427
Miss leveaux,

17:42.429 --> 17:44.262
That is a mighty
tempting basket

17:44.264 --> 17:45.296
You have there.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.864
Mrs. Stanton insisted

17:46.866 --> 17:49.100
I bring something
for the new reverend,

17:49.102 --> 17:50.935
Though I do worry about
leaving her with all that work

17:50.937 --> 17:52.470
At the cafe.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.872
She didn't seem concerned.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.475
If those cookies
are for pastor hogan,

17:57.477 --> 17:59.811
You can save yourself the trip.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.579
I just delivered a basket.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.781
Florence blakeley,

18:03.783 --> 18:07.118
I do believe you've taken
a shine to the new reverend.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.920
Not at all.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.221
I'm just doing my job

18:10.223 --> 18:13.324
As head of the pastoral
search committee.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.464
No one ever brought
cookies for me

18:19.466 --> 18:20.465
When I first
came to town.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.967
You're not a man of the cloth.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.002
No, no, I'm not,

18:25.004 --> 18:27.105
But I still like sweet things.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.307
Mr. Coulter...

18:29.309 --> 18:30.808
[giggles]

18:30.810 --> 18:32.443
Are you flirting with me?

18:32.445 --> 18:36.280
Tell you what...

18:36.282 --> 18:38.583
How about I buy
those cookies off you

18:38.585 --> 18:41.018
As a donation to the new church?

18:41.020 --> 18:42.620
They're very expensive.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.688
I have a feeling

18:43.690 --> 18:46.257
Everything about you
is very expensive.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.426
But worth it.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.894
I have no doubt.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.501
I never thought
I'd see the day

18:56.503 --> 18:58.035
That charles kensington iii

18:58.037 --> 19:00.271
Would eat dinner
with his fingers.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.508
I've never tried
fried chicken before.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.976
It's my friend
abigail's recipe.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.011
You prepared it?

19:07.013 --> 19:09.847
Oh, no, no, elsa made it.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.816
But I have become
a much better cook.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.284
Why do you
need to cook

19:13.286 --> 19:14.819
When there are people
to do it for you?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.154
[sighs]

19:16.156 --> 19:18.623
Sometimes, it's about
the little things, charles.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.125
We don't always need
people to do things for us.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.695
You always were
a revolutionary,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.964
And I do
admire you for it.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.534
It's just...

19:29.536 --> 19:32.970
Such a shame you're so far away.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.972
That's part of the challenge.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.141
I need to know that
I can take care of myself.

19:37.143 --> 19:39.744
Is that what this adventure
has been about?

19:39.746 --> 19:44.415
It's been about
a lot of things, really.

19:44.417 --> 19:48.219
Mostly, finding out answers
about myself.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.824
Sometimes, we spend so much time
searching for the answers,

19:53.826 --> 19:56.394
We don't realize they can be
right under our nose.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.240
I remember one winter
when I was about,

20:09.242 --> 20:10.875
Oh, 10 years old.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.410
It was a very
cold winter,

20:12.412 --> 20:14.345
And we ran out
of firewood.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.347
We had to
use straw instead.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.716
We tied it into
these little sticks,

20:18.718 --> 20:23.087
And sticks, they don't
burn very long.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.922
So, I vowed right
then and there,

20:24.924 --> 20:28.125
That I was never going to
run out of firewood again.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.528
And now I own
a whole mountain of it.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.798
I love a story
with a happy ending.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.801
I fee like I'm doing
all the talking, though.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.202
Listening
is the best way to learn

20:38.204 --> 20:39.971
About the human experience.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.840
And it's part of my homework
as a performer.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.244
So, what brought you
out west, then?

20:46.246 --> 20:47.979
Where the biggest applause
you're going to get

20:47.981 --> 20:50.581
Is from prairie dogs
and antelope?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.817
Well, personal reasons.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.951
Ah...

20:53.953 --> 20:57.288
Does the fellow
have a name?

20:57.290 --> 20:59.557
I didn't say
anything about a man.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.159
You didn't have to.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.897
Ah, constable thornton,
can I get you a drink?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.332
No thanks.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.934
Now, don't tell me

21:09.936 --> 21:11.769
You've spent the entire day
working on that school house?

21:11.771 --> 21:15.006
Actually, that's exactly
what I've been doing.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.340
It's a real labor
of love, isn't it?

21:16.342 --> 21:17.942
In more ways than one.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.677
Miss leveaux here was
just about to tell me

21:19.679 --> 21:21.912
What brought her to hope valley,

21:21.914 --> 21:25.983
And I have my suspicions
it was an affair of the heart.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.787
Well, I would be eager to hear
the latest version.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.791
Well, I would be happy
to tell you both,

21:33.793 --> 21:36.527
But I am needed
at the cafe.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.828
Abigail is simply
lost without me,

21:37.830 --> 21:39.196
And I mustn't let her down.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.769
Wow.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.771
I would love
to figure that woman out.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.339
Good luck with that.

21:50.008 --> 21:53.044
You're the reason
she came out here, aren't you?

21:54.279 --> 21:56.247
Ancient history.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.557
[knock on door]

22:11.330 --> 22:13.064
Oh, I'm sorry,

22:13.066 --> 22:14.565
We don't open
for another 20 minutes.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.000
Are you mrs. Stanton?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.301
Yes.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.172
I understand you've been
spending quite a bit of time

22:21.174 --> 22:24.008
With bill avery.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.643
I'm sorry, I...

22:25.645 --> 22:28.212
Is he here?

22:28.214 --> 22:31.882
Constable avery left town
this morning on business.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.352
Are you a friend of his?

22:34.354 --> 22:35.486
Friend?

22:37.222 --> 22:39.490
Hardly.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.392
I'm his wife.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.795
Nora avery.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.102
Mrs. Avery,
I can assure you,

22:51.104 --> 22:52.837
I did not know
that he was married.

22:52.839 --> 22:53.904
I would think
the wedding ring

22:53.906 --> 22:55.339
Would have given it away.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.608
He wasn't wearing a ring
when we met.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.043
I don't know what kind of game
you think you're playing,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.044
Mrs. Stanton,

23:00.046 --> 23:01.178
But there are laws

23:01.180 --> 23:03.047
That govern
this sort of behavior.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.784
Alienation of
affection, for one.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.953
I think you should go now.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.462
If my husband
comes back here,

23:18.464 --> 23:20.731
I assume you'll do
the honorable thing.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.466
And tell him that
I was looking for him?

23:22.468 --> 23:23.768
If he dares show his face here,

23:23.770 --> 23:26.203
I will have plenty to tell him.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.538
Good night.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.494
That's far enough.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.730
You got the merchandise?

24:27.933 --> 24:32.102
I hope your clients
find the work acceptable.

24:37.175 --> 24:38.642
Aunt agatha!

24:38.644 --> 24:39.710
What a pleasant surprise.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.111
I thought I'd stop in
to see your mother,

24:41.113 --> 24:45.349
And I am so glad to see
she is on the mend.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.650
Ooh, have you
been shopping?

24:46.652 --> 24:47.785
I have.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.520
I found some pastels
for the children

24:49.522 --> 24:50.554
That I can't get
in coal valley.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.456
School's starting
again very soon.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.658
Frontier life
must be exhilarating...

24:54.660 --> 24:55.626
Though I suppose there are
certain activities

24:55.628 --> 24:58.863
That might wear thin
after a while,

24:58.865 --> 25:00.197
Frog jumping contests,

25:00.199 --> 25:02.533
Or who could eat the most pie.

25:02.535 --> 25:03.968
[julie giggles]

25:03.970 --> 25:06.170
It's really isn't
like that at all.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.072
No, there are outlaws
and bandits.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.807
I was kidnapped
and held at gunpoint.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.408
Is this true?

25:11.410 --> 25:13.878
Actually, it's very civilized.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.881
We have ice cream socials
and Friday night literaries.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.483
Literaries. Hmm.

25:19.485 --> 25:24.054
Have either of you read
the latest d.H. Lawrence novel?

25:24.056 --> 25:25.256
[laughs] aunt agatha!

25:25.258 --> 25:26.924
I'm surprised
you read d.H. Lawrence.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.526
I hear his novels
are rather scandalous.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.027
My dear,

25:30.029 --> 25:31.028
Scandalous is what gets me
out of bed in the morning.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.397
I love a good romance.

25:33.399 --> 25:34.431
I would love
to be the lead

25:34.433 --> 25:36.400
In one of those novels.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.202
To live the life
of the femme fatale,

25:38.204 --> 25:41.939
Pursued by men who are dark,
and handsome, and mysterious.

25:41.941 --> 25:45.509
Or you could just
take up needlepoint?

25:50.782 --> 25:53.784
It looks like
you're making progress.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.219
Slowly but surely.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.754
Did you stop by to help?

25:56.756 --> 25:57.955
[chuckles]

25:57.957 --> 26:01.458
I think you two
are more than capable.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.860
Rip runs
a pretty tight ship.

26:04.429 --> 26:06.997
Can you pass me
that hammer?

26:09.434 --> 26:11.535
I'm sure elizabeth
will be thrilled

26:11.537 --> 26:15.306
To be out of the saloon
and back into a classroom.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.041
She's been
a good sport about it.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.577
She certainly has
"long-suffering schoolmarm"

26:19.579 --> 26:22.546
Written all over her.

26:25.383 --> 26:27.484
I don't envy her situation...

26:27.486 --> 26:30.921
Torn between her family
and her new life here.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.389
She's not torn.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.791
Once her mother's
health improves,

26:33.793 --> 26:35.793
She'll come back.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.661
Of course.
I just mean

26:37.663 --> 26:40.831
Families have a way
of luring you back in.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.801
Well, and let's be honest,

26:43.803 --> 26:46.303
City life does have
its charms.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.738
So does hope valley.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.842
I'll leave you to your work.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.677
And don't forget
we have a meeting later.

26:53.679 --> 26:56.246
We're going to raise
money for the church.

26:56.248 --> 26:59.016
Our town really is coming alive,
don't you think?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.986
A school, a church,

27:01.988 --> 27:03.153
A sawmill...

27:03.155 --> 27:04.254
A timber tycoon

27:04.256 --> 27:08.993
In need of
female companionship.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.863
I hadn't noticed.

27:20.038 --> 27:22.806
I'm sure we can come
to an understanding.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.275
There's not a lot
to understand, silas.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.277
You owe me a substantial
amount of money,

27:27.279 --> 27:29.313
And it's time
to repay that debt.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.148
I can't lay my hands
on that kind of cash.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.516
Not all at once.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.351
We could always
let the court decide

27:34.353 --> 27:37.521
How you're going to make good
on your obligations,

27:37.523 --> 27:41.125
But then, there would likely
be discovery of transactions

27:41.127 --> 27:44.361
Made with public funds
during your tenure.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.497
They could implicate
you as well.

27:46.499 --> 27:50.034
Silas, please.

27:50.036 --> 27:53.504
No one has ever been able
to implicate me in anything.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.905
It may, however,
be a different story for you,

27:54.907 --> 27:56.974
As mayor.

27:56.976 --> 28:00.477
Henry, I don't have the money.

28:00.479 --> 28:04.415
So unless you want
a pound of flesh...

28:04.417 --> 28:08.085
I don't think
it needs to come to that.

28:08.087 --> 28:12.122
By the way, how is your health?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.097
I do hope we have
enough refreshments.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.598
People always give
more generously

28:21.600 --> 28:22.733
When they have
a glass of lemonade

28:22.735 --> 28:24.435
And a slice of pie.

28:25.837 --> 28:28.706
Abigail, is there
something wrong?

28:28.708 --> 28:31.241
Oh, I'm fine.

28:31.243 --> 28:34.912
I just haven't heard from clara
since the trial,

28:34.914 --> 28:38.515
And she said she would write
when she got back to hamilton.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.017
Is that all?

28:40.019 --> 28:42.186
Yes.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.121
No, it isn't.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.790
[sighs]

28:47.859 --> 28:49.560
It's bill avery.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.862
Ah, the perfect suitor.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.964
Except for one little thing.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.599
Which is?

28:55.601 --> 28:57.267
He has a wife.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.569
[gasps] no.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.204
Yes.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.307
And half of me is furious
and the other half...

29:04.442 --> 29:06.143
Well, the cad got
under your skin.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.445
Oh, that low-life.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.714
You know,
this happened to me once.

29:10.716 --> 29:13.117
I had just finished a run
of "the yankee prince"

29:13.119 --> 29:14.952
On broadway.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.488
Well, the lying cheat
courted me for a month

29:17.490 --> 29:19.423
Before I found out
he was married.

29:19.425 --> 29:20.691
What did you do?

29:21.893 --> 29:24.461
Gave that scoundrel
a black eye.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.830
But I kept the jewelry.

29:26.832 --> 29:27.931
Well, I didn't get a chance

29:27.933 --> 29:29.099
To give the scoundrel
a black eye

29:29.101 --> 29:30.434
Because he skipped town.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.401
And I didn't get any jewelry.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.736
Oh my dear.

29:32.738 --> 29:37.341
Never commit your heart
unless there's jewelry.

29:37.343 --> 29:40.677
I'll keep that in mind
for next time.

29:41.913 --> 29:44.214
Well, I'm glad I could be
of some help.

29:45.850 --> 29:49.787
You know, I really am enjoying
our little heart to heart chats.

29:49.789 --> 29:53.590
You know, so am I.

30:01.332 --> 30:03.600
[clearing throat]

30:03.602 --> 30:07.838
Now, before we ask you
to open your hearts

30:07.840 --> 30:08.872
And your wallets,

30:08.874 --> 30:10.541
Perhaps our new pastor

30:10.543 --> 30:11.875
Would like to say a few words.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.249
Of course.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.085
Delicious.

30:28.359 --> 30:29.560
Dearly beloved,

30:29.562 --> 30:33.831
We are gathered here
to raise funds

30:33.833 --> 30:37.401
For our church programs.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.671
Still waters run deep,

30:40.673 --> 30:42.906
And so do deep pockets.

30:42.908 --> 30:45.475
Dig deep in those pockets
and give.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.744
Onward, christian soldiers.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.914
Amen.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.383
[applause]

30:55.320 --> 30:58.088
Now, let's
get down to business.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.324
I am pleased
to announce

31:00.326 --> 31:02.659
That mr. Lee coulter

31:02.661 --> 31:05.596
Has already
bought a basket

31:05.598 --> 31:07.598
Of my delicious
homemade cookies

31:07.600 --> 31:11.034
For a $10 donation

31:11.036 --> 31:13.904
To our church programs.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.105
And I will pledge
another 20

31:15.107 --> 31:16.440
If you'll agree
to accompany me

31:16.442 --> 31:20.210
To the ice cream social
on Saturday night.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.678
[chuckles]

31:21.680 --> 31:23.347
I'll consider it

31:23.349 --> 31:24.715
For 25.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.216
Done.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.351
[laughs]

31:27.353 --> 31:29.753
[applause]

31:31.789 --> 31:36.526
Five dollars will pay
for a child's choir robe.

31:36.528 --> 31:37.895
There's going to be
a children's choir?

31:37.897 --> 31:39.463
That's a wonderful idea.

31:39.465 --> 31:42.065
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves now.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.801
Why don't we start off
with donations of $2

31:44.803 --> 31:48.038
For hymnals and bibles
just to start.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.445
If I could have
everybody's attention.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.114
I have an announcement
to make.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.982
Last night,

31:58.984 --> 32:01.752
I asked mary dunbar here
to be my wife,

32:01.754 --> 32:03.086
And she said yes.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.254
[applause and cheers]

32:04.256 --> 32:06.456
Congratulations.

32:12.563 --> 32:15.732
We would be honored
if pastor hogan would marry us,

32:15.734 --> 32:17.000
If that's all right.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.969
Of course
that's all right.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.737
The fee is $5.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.340
That'll be the best $5
I'll ever spend.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.175
But the thing is, folks,

32:25.177 --> 32:27.678
We don't even
have a church yet here.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.947
You can marry them
right here, daddy.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.415
That's a wonderful idea.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.582
We wouldn't need much.

32:32.584 --> 32:33.583
It doesn't need
to be fancy.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.851
We're simple folk.

32:34.853 --> 32:38.822
It will be simple,
but it will be perfect.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.324
Now, don't
you two lovebirds

32:40.326 --> 32:41.425
Worry about a thing.

32:41.427 --> 32:44.127
I will take care of
all the details.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.529
I'll just have to tell abigail

32:45.531 --> 32:47.364
That I won't be able
to help out in the cafe

32:47.366 --> 32:51.702
Because of all this extra
responsibility.

32:53.204 --> 32:54.871
I'm sure abigail will find a way
to muddle through without you.

32:54.873 --> 32:55.872
Oh.

33:05.616 --> 33:06.783
I didn't think
you'd come.

33:11.889 --> 33:12.856
Your note said
it was urgent.

33:12.858 --> 33:15.158
Is everything all right?

33:15.160 --> 33:16.226
I thought
you might have

33:16.228 --> 33:17.627
Gotten the wrong
impression of me,

33:17.629 --> 33:20.030
And I didn't want to start out
on the wrong foot.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.131
You thought
I'd think less of you

33:21.133 --> 33:22.833
Because of the fight at the bar?

33:22.835 --> 33:24.634
See, that's the thing.
It really wasn't a fight.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.270
Just a couple of fellows
horsing around is all.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.073
I knew if you were
with constable thornton,

33:30.075 --> 33:31.541
It couldn't be anything bad.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.710
Can I see you again?

33:35.046 --> 33:37.614
I don't see why not.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.593
Well, I'm glad to see
you're not a teetotaler.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.095
Well, the way I see it,

33:52.097 --> 33:54.231
Jesus turned water
into wine for a reason.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.533
I like your style, pastor.
The next round's on me.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.535
Greatly appreciated

33:58.537 --> 34:00.337
I take it this'll be your
first wedding in a saloon?

34:00.339 --> 34:01.405
It will,

34:01.407 --> 34:02.606
But what could be better?

34:02.608 --> 34:04.007
The union of a man
and a woman,

34:04.009 --> 34:06.043
And the union of a man
and his barstool,

34:06.045 --> 34:07.210
All under one roof.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.278
[laughs]

34:08.280 --> 34:09.346
Here we go.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.349
$232.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.219
That's a lot of bibles.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.422
Hard-earned, too.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.057
Even with the settlement
from the mining company,

34:20.059 --> 34:21.892
The widows have to be careful
with what they spend.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.527
Widows?

34:23.529 --> 34:24.528
But we're strong.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.464
And generous.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.933
So you order those bibles,
and hymnals,

34:29.935 --> 34:31.701
And choir robes.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.340
Whoa. Um...

34:38.976 --> 34:41.912
Well, maybe we should
just use half of the money.

34:41.914 --> 34:43.547
The good book always says

34:43.549 --> 34:45.549
It's a smart thing
to save for a rainy day.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.583
There's no sense
procrastinating,

34:46.585 --> 34:47.617
If you're aiming
to get things done.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.585
Yeah, we're making
good progress

34:48.587 --> 34:49.586
On the church.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.254
Mm-hmm.

34:51.256 --> 34:54.057
Well, I'll leave the decision
in your capable hands, pastor.

34:54.059 --> 34:57.994
I'm sure if you pray
for guidance,

34:57.996 --> 35:01.598
You'll know
just what to do with the money.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.500
Indeed.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.005
Indeed.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.513
The chateaubriand
was just delicious.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.115
Even better than I remember.

35:18.117 --> 35:21.451
Well, here, try a spoonful
of cherries jubilee.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.519
Oh, I couldn't.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.221
I insist.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.626
Oh, my goodness.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.962
That is heaven on earth.

35:31.964 --> 35:35.265
Do you remember
the last time we were here

35:35.267 --> 35:37.134
And we played that wicked
prank on your aunt?

35:37.136 --> 35:39.169
And what prank was that?

35:39.171 --> 35:41.838
We took all of the spoons
off the waiter's cart

35:41.840 --> 35:43.473
And hid them
in aunt agatha's umbrella.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.475
You can only imagine
how horrified she was

35:45.477 --> 35:47.677
When she opened it
in front of the coat-check room.

35:49.180 --> 35:53.116
They nearly arrested her
for stealing the silver.

35:53.118 --> 35:55.552
You two are <i>trÃ¨s incorrigible.</i>

35:55.554 --> 35:56.953
I'm sure you have plenty
of mischievous stories

35:56.955 --> 35:57.921
About viola.

36:03.027 --> 36:04.861
No, not really.

36:08.199 --> 36:11.801
Well, we had
a very strict governess.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.837
She came from a little burg
just south of zurich...

36:13.839 --> 36:15.372
Oh, yes,
frau bustenhaller.

36:15.374 --> 36:18.008
I can still smell
the cod liver oil on her breath.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.544
As I was saying,

36:20.546 --> 36:22.379
One morning,

36:22.381 --> 36:24.047
After our
history lesson,

36:24.049 --> 36:26.149
I hid her reading glasses.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.720
It took her ages to find them.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.522
She was completely miffed.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.057
How positively wicked
of you, my darling.

36:34.059 --> 36:36.193
It was terribly
naughty, I know.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.194
Are there
any more secrets

36:37.196 --> 36:38.595
I need to know
about you?

36:38.597 --> 36:41.131
You'll have the rest
of your life to find out.

36:43.334 --> 36:46.169
Viola...

36:46.171 --> 36:49.206
Is there anything
you wish to share with us?

36:49.208 --> 36:51.541
Well...

36:51.543 --> 36:52.609
I know it's a secret,

36:52.611 --> 36:53.910
And we're not supposed to
announce it yet,

36:53.912 --> 36:54.911
But I just have to
say something,

36:54.913 --> 36:56.947
Or I'll burst.

36:56.949 --> 36:59.916
Sir lionel and I
are engaged to be married.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.219
Congratulations!

37:02.221 --> 37:03.853
I'm so happy for you.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.855
I'd say this calls for a toast.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.692
Waiter, a bottle
of champagne, please.

37:10.628 --> 37:13.630
Miss leveaux,
it looks fantastic.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.565
I guess beautiful people know
how to make things beautiful.

37:15.567 --> 37:19.035
Well, it's just
what I do.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.136
There's no official
announcement yet,

37:20.138 --> 37:22.038
But I heard
he'll be resigning tomorrow.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.440
Any idea why?

37:23.442 --> 37:24.574
Something about
his health.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.076
Sorry,
who's resigning?

37:26.078 --> 37:27.544
Mayor ramsey.

37:27.546 --> 37:28.578
Really?

37:28.580 --> 37:29.946
Who's taking his place?

37:29.948 --> 37:31.047
The town by-laws state

37:31.049 --> 37:32.482
That the president of
the town council

37:32.484 --> 37:34.918
Serves as interim mayor
until the next election.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.720
And who heads
the council?

37:36.722 --> 37:39.456
I do.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.125
Of course you do.

37:42.127 --> 37:43.426
I cannot express to you

37:43.428 --> 37:46.630
How much I am looking forward
to being your mayor.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.598
Good evening.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.966
Okay.

37:55.072 --> 37:55.939
You all set
to tie the noose?

37:55.941 --> 37:58.308
Noose?

37:58.310 --> 37:59.976
He means "knot."

37:59.978 --> 38:01.478
Paraphrasing, of course.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.646
I'm ready.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.347
Okay, good, good.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.350
I am so nervous.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.985
I was nervous
at my wedding, too.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.954
In fact, I forgot
to say "I do"

38:10.956 --> 38:12.322
When the reverend
asked me.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.590
And what did you say?

38:13.592 --> 38:15.792
I said "I think so."

38:15.794 --> 38:17.661
[laughing]

38:17.663 --> 38:20.096
[playing "the wedding March"]

38:20.098 --> 38:22.065
[â™ª]

38:45.456 --> 38:48.224
Please, be seated.

38:52.963 --> 38:54.164
Dearly beloved,

38:54.166 --> 38:56.066
We are gathered here today

38:56.068 --> 38:58.401
To see whether a marriage
can endure

38:58.403 --> 39:01.371
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.207
So if anyone
has objections

39:04.209 --> 39:06.476
To this state
of the union,

39:06.478 --> 39:08.244
They may speak now
or forever hold--

39:08.246 --> 39:10.013
I have an objection.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.483
And who are you?

39:13.485 --> 39:16.319
I think the real question here
is who are you?

39:18.422 --> 39:20.390
The pastor frank hogan.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.659
Really?

39:22.661 --> 39:24.527
Because I'm pastor frank hogan,

39:24.529 --> 39:26.396
I don't think
you're a real pastor at all.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.397
Really?

39:28.432 --> 39:30.600
He's not
a real pastor?

39:30.602 --> 39:31.868
This is not
a real wedding?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.903
Not until I pronounce
you man and wife--

39:33.905 --> 39:37.574
Which I will do...

39:40.211 --> 39:44.581
As long as you promise to love,
honor, and obey each other

39:44.583 --> 39:46.282
Till death do you part.

39:46.284 --> 39:47.884
I do.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.886
So do I.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.788
Well, kiss the bride.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.423
Okay.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.024
[everyone sighs in delight]

39:55.026 --> 39:57.727
I have a new dad.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.263
[applause and cheers]

40:06.570 --> 40:08.671
You two aren't going anywhere.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.274
I think you
should lock him up

40:11.276 --> 40:12.609
And throw away the key.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.943
I agree, florence,

40:13.945 --> 40:15.612
But that would leave
annabelle without a father,

40:15.614 --> 40:17.580
And that doesn't
seem right.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.882
Well, we could shoot him...

40:18.884 --> 40:20.116
[everyone gasps]

40:20.118 --> 40:21.584
Or we could
pray for him,

40:21.586 --> 40:22.886
Since there's
no one among us

40:22.888 --> 40:25.121
That doesn't need forgiveness.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.389
I've been telling him

40:26.391 --> 40:28.258
This is no way to raise
an innocent child.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.593
[jack]: Okay, folks,
here's what we're going to do.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.329
First, you are going to
return all the money

40:33.331 --> 40:35.064
That you have taken
from these people,

40:35.066 --> 40:36.466
Then I'm going to send
your picture

40:36.468 --> 40:38.067
With the words
"con artist"

40:38.069 --> 40:40.170
To every town within
a hundred miles of here.

40:40.172 --> 40:43.339
Fair enough?

40:43.341 --> 40:45.308
That's more than
kind, constable.

40:45.310 --> 40:48.344
He'll turn over
a new leaf, I promise.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.088
Thank you.

40:59.090 --> 41:03.159
Well, this has been
a wonderful evening.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.128
Dear elizabeth.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.197
I hope someday you will be
as happy as we are.

41:07.199 --> 41:09.499
If that's at all possible.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.167
Oh, I'm sure
it's very possible.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.170
A toast...
