WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:06.269
Opportunity. It never just happens.

00:06.271 --> 00:09.606
Opportunity must be
dragged into submission

00:09.607 --> 00:11.608
by unflinching determination.

00:11.609 --> 00:14.878
That is what I've done
with everything in my life,

00:14.879 --> 00:21.718
from my businesses to
my unique collections.

00:21.719 --> 00:24.921
Truly, there is nothing you cannot get

00:24.923 --> 00:28.358
if you are determined enough.

00:28.359 --> 00:33.897
So if your offer provides me
with a suitable opportunity,

00:33.898 --> 00:38.135
I have no doubt I can
obtain what you desire.

01:32.724 --> 01:36.660
Ah!

01:59.384 --> 02:01.418
Ah!

02:37.255 --> 02:38.955
Ah!

02:38.956 --> 02:41.658
The fighter battles with
passion of the heart.

02:41.659 --> 02:43.293
Ah!

02:43.294 --> 02:47.130
But a true warrior battles
with wisdom of the soul.

02:47.131 --> 02:48.899
Ah!

02:48.900 --> 02:52.102
In Oklahoma, that's all we got is soul.

02:54.906 --> 02:58.375
The Death Touch.

02:58.376 --> 03:03.313
One more ounce of pressure and
Monkey King's life is through.

03:08.152 --> 03:11.588
Well done.

03:11.589 --> 03:13.423
Your training is complete.

03:15.993 --> 03:18.431
Master, please, I can't be done.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.600
I've not even been here two months.

03:20.601 --> 03:24.070
Time is not the measure of man, Jacob.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.039
Only what he achieves.

03:26.040 --> 03:30.677
Monkey king earned the
staff of Shangri-La.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.779
Your destiny lies elsewhere.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.848
The Library was right to send
you here to complete training,

03:35.850 --> 03:39.452
but I have taught you all that I can.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.658
Come on, there's gotta be
something else you can teach me.

03:47.394 --> 03:51.431
- Well, there are magical techniques...
- No.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.199
No magic.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.402
And I respect that decision,
but it means from now on,

03:56.403 --> 04:00.106
your lessons must be
ones you teach yourself.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.375
That is your practice.

04:02.376 --> 04:07.780
For Monkey King, I
practice something else.

04:07.781 --> 04:11.117
Making banana smoothies.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.330
Jenkins!

04:31.539 --> 04:34.107
What is this place? What's
with all the candles?

04:34.108 --> 04:36.075
The Chamber of Memories, sir.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.945
Couldn't just call it the Candle Room?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.514
Well, with the rooms of the
Library being moved as they were,

04:41.515 --> 04:43.650
I only rediscovered it today.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.818
Each candle is linked
to the soul of a person

04:45.819 --> 04:47.453
connected to the Library.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.922
If the flame burns,
they are still alive.

04:49.924 --> 04:52.592
If not, they are a memory,

04:52.593 --> 04:56.162
and the Chamber gives us
very good news today, sir.

04:57.932 --> 04:59.365
Carlene's candle.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.537
Still burning.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.440
So, she's alive.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.542
Yes, sir.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.144
I knew it.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.813
It is good to have one's hopes affirmed.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.448
Indeed.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.651
Oh, wow.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.053
This room's gonna get a lot darker

05:20.054 --> 05:22.021
when my candle goes out, eh, Jenkins?

05:22.022 --> 05:24.891
Uh, actually, sir, that's
Colonel Baird's candle.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.460
Oh. Which one is mine?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.862
That one.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.365
What?!

05:32.366 --> 05:33.700
That one?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.702
What? Oh, no. no, no,
no, sir, not that one.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.003
That's Mr. Jones'.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.206
Actually... that one.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.575
Oh.

05:42.576 --> 05:47.347
Doesn't seem to have very far to go.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.550
Well, every candle must go out sometime.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.826
"A thousand candles can be lit from one,

05:59.827 --> 06:01.728
but that candle's life is not shortened.

06:01.729 --> 06:06.099
Happiness never deceases
by being shared."

06:06.100 --> 06:09.001
That quote is easy. Gautama Buddha.

06:09.003 --> 06:11.337
- Gah.
- My turn.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.640
"Every man has a plan
until he is struck."

06:14.642 --> 06:17.710
Sun Tsu? No. Confucius?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.113
Mike Tyson.

06:20.114 --> 06:24.016
To wisdom, in all its forms.

06:24.018 --> 06:27.086
And to the power of the soul.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.062
- Sifu!
- Save my staff!

06:37.431 --> 06:41.567
- Sifu?
- The staff is more important than me.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.652
Step away from the staff.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.123
Sorry, but that is
exactly what I've come for.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.125
Not if I have anything to do with it.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.195
Then we are happy to oblige.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.764
All of us.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.000
Son of...

07:34.788 --> 07:35.922
No!

07:38.859 --> 07:41.127
Seize him!

08:38.452 --> 08:43.557
And Shangri-La is mine.

08:50.438 --> 08:52.238
On.

09:02.650 --> 09:03.917
Off.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.652
Off.

09:05.653 --> 09:08.455
Are you okay?

09:08.456 --> 09:10.824
Sure.

09:12.126 --> 09:13.893
No. I don't know.

09:13.894 --> 09:19.466
When I got out of surgery, I was so
grateful that I still had my gift,

09:19.467 --> 09:21.701
but it's not the same.

09:21.702 --> 09:22.702
Right, you said.

09:22.703 --> 09:25.371
It's... bigger.

09:25.373 --> 09:28.041
It's a lot bigger.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.343
And it does different things.

09:30.344 --> 09:34.180
It affects people.

09:34.181 --> 09:36.683
I don't know how to control it.

09:36.684 --> 09:38.618
It's scary.

09:40.654 --> 09:44.924
When we first met, you weren't
in control of the gift you had.

09:44.925 --> 09:46.628
You thought you'd never
get a handle on it.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.062
- But you did.
- Yeah, but that's the thing.

09:49.063 --> 09:50.886
I'm afraid to try it.
What if I hurt somebody?

09:50.887 --> 09:54.200
Look, I've been working
with Stone and Ezekiel,

09:54.201 --> 09:55.984
trying to get everyone
where they need to be,

09:55.985 --> 09:59.973
but you're the one I can't help.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.675
I don't understand magic like you do.

10:02.676 --> 10:05.078
I can't imagine what it's like

10:05.079 --> 10:08.314
having a gift like yours.

10:08.315 --> 10:10.650
Still, I've seen the future you,

10:10.651 --> 10:13.186
and you're amazing.

10:13.187 --> 10:15.688
And I know you'll eventually get there.

10:17.191 --> 10:20.860
The Library chose
you. Not for your gift,

10:20.861 --> 10:25.498
but for your ability to know
when to use it and when not to.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.367
And when the time comes,

10:27.368 --> 10:30.537
I know you'll do the right thing.

10:30.538 --> 10:31.938
Thank you.

10:37.344 --> 10:39.913
Stone?

10:39.914 --> 10:44.310
Shangri-La is under attack.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.294
For centuries, the
location of Shangri-La

10:46.295 --> 10:49.489
has been a deeply-held secret
within the magic community.

10:49.490 --> 10:51.558
I'm telling you, the guy
swooped in with an army.

10:51.559 --> 10:54.360
This Asian gentlemen
with a group of thugs...

10:54.361 --> 10:55.695
Not thugs, ninjas.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.065
Ninjas... black PJs, blow
darts, the whole nine yards.

10:59.066 --> 11:00.526
That's why we gotta get back there,

11:00.527 --> 11:02.328
call up everybody we
know, clear it out ASAP.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.704
I think I may know him.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.773
Did he look like this?

11:06.774 --> 11:08.141
That's him.

11:08.142 --> 11:10.109
- Sterling Lam.
- Sterling Lam.

11:10.111 --> 11:12.378
Chinese billionaire,
collector of antiquities.

11:12.379 --> 11:14.047
He and I have crossed paths before...

11:14.048 --> 11:17.016
in Cambodia over the Shield of Angora,

11:17.017 --> 11:20.320
and I beat him, but it came at a cost.

11:21.655 --> 11:24.324
So Lam is serious.

11:24.325 --> 11:26.559
That's why we have to go back.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.027
Okay, but we go back smart.

11:28.028 --> 11:30.163
It gets complicated when
mentors are involved.

11:30.164 --> 11:32.732
Because you trust and care about
them, you make rash decisions.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.436
I'm not being rash. He's my sifu.

11:36.437 --> 11:38.238
I owe him.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.907
- You don't understand...
- Actually, I do.

11:40.908 --> 11:43.343
Back at NATO I had an incredible mentor

11:43.344 --> 11:46.546
who meant the world
to me, but... anyway.

11:46.547 --> 11:49.667
The point is, if we go back, we have to
know what we're getting ourselves into.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.102
Well, we know he's a well-funded
ninja-commanding badass.

11:52.104 --> 11:54.287
What about Shangri-La.
Is it on a ley line?

11:54.288 --> 11:57.090
No. Doesn't need to be, though.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.525
Even before the Monkey King repaired it,

11:59.527 --> 12:03.029
it was always a source...
powerful source of white magic.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.918
It's only thanks to the
kings staff and magical tail

12:05.919 --> 12:07.799
that he has been able to
hold power for so long.

12:07.823 --> 12:09.636
Repaired? What happened?

12:10.901 --> 12:12.841
All right, it may have
been partially destroyed

12:12.843 --> 12:14.586
when I was going after
the Spear of Destiny.

12:14.587 --> 12:16.672
But it wasn't my fault.

12:16.673 --> 12:17.840
Okay.

12:17.841 --> 12:19.809
Can you get us in there
using a magic door?

12:19.810 --> 12:22.091
Mm, I can get you near the
city, but not inside the walls.

12:22.092 --> 12:24.141
The city itself is such a
powerful source of magic,

12:24.143 --> 12:26.115
should it fall into the wrong hands...

12:26.116 --> 12:28.083
Magic could be turned to the dark side.

12:28.085 --> 12:31.453
Yes, and then the balance of good
and evil on the Earth... boop.

12:31.455 --> 12:34.490
Which would give Lam even
more bad magic on his side.

12:34.491 --> 12:35.925
And further empower Apep.

12:35.926 --> 12:38.160
Which means multiple levels of suckage.

12:38.161 --> 12:39.628
But none of that has happened yet.

12:39.629 --> 12:41.363
Now, according to legend,

12:41.364 --> 12:43.599
he who wields the Staff
of Shangri-La at sundown

12:43.600 --> 12:45.668
- becomes its rightful ruler.
- Correct.

12:45.669 --> 12:48.297
So, we go back there, we don't
have to take on Lam directly,

12:48.298 --> 12:50.241
we just have to get the
staff from him by sunset.

12:50.242 --> 12:52.675
How do we do that and
not go head-to-head?

12:52.676 --> 12:55.377
He knows you. He's seen me now,

12:55.378 --> 12:57.481
and if the organization is
as sharp as you say it is,

12:57.482 --> 12:58.981
they probably know Baird, too.

12:58.982 --> 13:02.718
What do you say we take a
page out of "The Odyssey"?

13:13.797 --> 13:15.264
Strangers at the gate.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.466
Land pirates, they say,
with something to sell.

13:17.467 --> 13:19.969
- Shield of Angkor.
- Impossible.

13:19.970 --> 13:22.471
They claim to have stolen
it from a Librarian.

13:23.907 --> 13:25.841
Bring them in.

13:28.478 --> 13:33.449
The Shield of Angkor. King Jayavarman
used it to push his enemies to the sea.

13:33.450 --> 13:35.551
Yet somehow it has come
into the possession of...

13:35.552 --> 13:38.354
Amy Adamantite and Mr. Zet.

13:38.355 --> 13:41.123
Odd. I thought I knew
everyone in our line of work.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.458
Yet I've never heard of you.

13:42.459 --> 13:44.226
You say you took it from a Librarian?

13:44.227 --> 13:46.161
Long story, one we can tell

13:46.163 --> 13:47.897
after we discuss some business.

13:47.898 --> 13:51.734
Or I can kill you and
take the shield right now.

13:51.735 --> 13:55.137
She shield is protected by
the Seven Curses of Khmer.

13:57.174 --> 13:58.874
Unless I give you the revocation chant,

13:58.875 --> 14:02.511
whoever touches it loses their
memories, hearing, hair...

14:02.512 --> 14:05.581
I know all about the Seven Curses.

14:05.582 --> 14:07.983
Well played.

14:09.186 --> 14:12.288
Let's discuss business over tea.

14:24.034 --> 14:25.834
I'd say we're clear.

14:27.571 --> 14:28.671
Ha! Nice plan.

14:28.672 --> 14:30.639
It's a Trojan horse.
It works every time.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.807
Yay, "Odyssey."

14:31.808 --> 14:33.375
This way.

14:34.856 --> 14:37.091
Land pirates. In other
words, mercenaries.

14:37.092 --> 14:38.692
We're not big on titles.

14:38.693 --> 14:39.629
I don't suppose you ever crossed paths

14:39.630 --> 14:41.131
with Black-Eyed Pierre?

14:41.132 --> 14:43.800
The scourge of southern antiquities?

14:43.801 --> 14:45.702
We beat him to the Helm of Troy.

14:46.871 --> 14:48.972
What about Mad Carlos Gabaldon?

14:48.973 --> 14:50.607
The Raider of the Rainforest?

14:50.608 --> 14:52.509
He beat us to the
Scepter of Machu Picchu,

14:52.510 --> 14:54.410
but then got arrested.

14:55.613 --> 14:58.548
How about Ezekiel Jones?

14:58.549 --> 15:00.183
He's a Librarian.

15:00.184 --> 15:04.287
A great thief. Foolishly went
to work for the other side.

15:04.288 --> 15:07.757
I never saw the man, but I
did hear his voice at a party

15:07.758 --> 15:11.060
boasting about a conquest in
that arrogant accent of his.

15:11.062 --> 15:12.896
I will never forget it.

15:12.897 --> 15:16.566
He was also the last man to touch
the shield before we got to it.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.002
You killed Ezekiel Jones?

15:19.003 --> 15:22.572
- How?
- We choked him.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.407
Excellent.

15:24.408 --> 15:26.509
I have a history with Librarians.

15:26.510 --> 15:29.345
I heard that Mr. Jones
was the most clever.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.715
Seriously? I just... I
mean, I'd never heard that.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.919
- Doesn't your partner talk?
- No.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.887
Uh, he was struck by
lightning as a child

15:37.888 --> 15:40.623
and his fillings fused his jaw shut.

15:40.624 --> 15:43.193
Shall we discuss price?

15:50.134 --> 15:51.677
I have to admit, Shangri-La

15:51.678 --> 15:53.002
looks better than I remember.

15:53.003 --> 15:54.943
Right, receiving chamber's
on the first floor.

15:54.944 --> 15:57.807
Throne room and the staff are on the
top floor. There's only two guards.

15:57.808 --> 16:00.804
Whoa, whoa, whoa, if just one of
those guards sets off an alarm,

16:00.805 --> 16:02.388
we'll have to take on 10 times as many.

16:02.389 --> 16:04.547
True, still, most throne rooms are built

16:04.548 --> 16:06.850
with a secret exit to ward off coups
and assassinations and the like.

16:06.851 --> 16:08.882
Right, like the queen's
room in Buckingham Palace.

16:08.883 --> 16:10.443
Or the exit in the floor at Versailles.

16:10.467 --> 16:11.921
So we're looking for a secret door.

16:11.922 --> 16:14.624
Guys, I've been living
here for over a month.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.693
Secret door is this way.

16:20.798 --> 16:22.265
There.

16:27.471 --> 16:29.172
The Staff of Shangri-La.

16:29.173 --> 16:33.209
- It's probably booby trapped.
- Yeah, but I got a plan.

16:33.210 --> 16:36.179
You take the staff, I place this one.

16:36.180 --> 16:37.614
Okay, okay. Good thinking.

16:37.615 --> 16:38.982
- So, on my count.
- Yeah.

16:38.983 --> 16:40.917
Three, two...

16:40.918 --> 16:43.119
Ah!

16:47.858 --> 16:51.094
- Argh!
- Not again.

16:56.634 --> 16:58.534
Well done, Your Highness.

17:02.925 --> 17:06.377
My head feels like it was stomped
on by The Colossus of Rhodes.

17:06.377 --> 17:09.867
Yeah, well, Valerian sleeping
drugs will do that to you.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.851
You know, it would've been
nice if you'd mentioned

17:11.852 --> 17:13.905
that your sifu had
joined forces with Lam.

17:13.906 --> 17:17.575
He didn't. I mean, that's
not the king I know.

17:17.576 --> 17:20.377
Lam did something, changed him.

17:20.378 --> 17:22.446
Well, clearly knew we were coming.

17:22.448 --> 17:24.415
Why would they just knock us out?

17:24.415 --> 17:29.354
Because we're Librarians, a prize
that can only yield bigger prizes.

17:29.355 --> 17:30.978
Only thing bigger
than us would be, um...

17:30.979 --> 17:32.090
- Guardian.
- Exactly.

17:32.091 --> 17:34.058
- Where's Eve?
- She was gone when I woke up.

17:34.059 --> 17:35.460
We gotta get outta here.

17:35.461 --> 17:37.261
That's what I'm working on.

17:37.263 --> 17:38.663
Luckily, they put us in a room

17:38.664 --> 17:41.532
with marble urns, baking
soda, and tin foil.

17:41.533 --> 17:44.869
Right, so we're going
to bake our way out?

17:46.472 --> 17:49.207
So we have a deal?

17:49.208 --> 17:51.209
Works for us.

17:51.210 --> 17:53.411
Excellent.

17:53.412 --> 17:56.013
I will have my men
collect your gold and...

17:58.684 --> 18:01.052
Excuse me.

18:03.789 --> 18:05.556
Jaw fused shut?

18:05.557 --> 18:07.577
I'm sorry, but when he
said he'd heard your voice,

18:07.578 --> 18:09.641
electroplating was the
first thing I could think of.

18:10.696 --> 18:12.399
- Ezekiel?
- Hang on, something's going on.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.165
Yeah, Baird's been caught. Look.

18:16.402 --> 18:18.636
That's not good.

18:18.637 --> 18:20.171
- Neither is that.
- What do we do?

18:20.172 --> 18:21.806
Save our Guardian.

18:26.679 --> 18:28.479
Guard, guard!

18:28.480 --> 18:30.946
Guard, help! Help!

18:30.947 --> 18:32.450
He needs help. He's choking! Choking!

18:32.451 --> 18:33.851
Needs water, please.

18:33.852 --> 18:36.053
He's not worth anything to anybody dead.

18:36.055 --> 18:37.622
Thank you. Thank you.

18:44.363 --> 18:47.165
Perfect.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.762
What's this water gonna do?

18:50.763 --> 18:53.266
Well, marble mixed with baking
soda gives you sodium carbonate.

18:53.267 --> 18:56.808
Sodium carbonate mixed with leftover
calcium hydroxide gives you lye,

18:56.809 --> 19:00.311
and lye mixed with
aluminum gives you sodium

19:00.312 --> 19:02.847
and sodium mixed with water

19:02.848 --> 19:06.551
gives you a little something I
like to call a coulomb explosion.

19:23.736 --> 19:26.637
Remind me to never let
you into the Annex kitchen.

19:27.306 --> 19:28.840
Guys are knocked out cold.

19:28.841 --> 19:30.908
This one's not.

19:35.981 --> 19:37.215
Eve.

19:37.216 --> 19:38.549
It's just a bunch of cages.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.485
Yeah, cages full of magical items.

19:40.486 --> 19:42.553
Hercules' club, magic carpet,

19:42.554 --> 19:44.889
Crystal of Athar? This
guy collects everything.

19:44.890 --> 19:48.559
Everything and everyone.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.862
Eve!

19:50.863 --> 19:53.431
Flynn!

19:53.432 --> 19:56.901
This is the last place you should be.

20:00.493 --> 20:02.813
Don't worry Charlene we're
going to get you out in no time.

20:02.837 --> 20:04.913
- Yeah, boys...
- This is a 1793 Bowman lock.

20:04.914 --> 20:07.640
- Yeah, boys... - Eighteen iron slides,
470 million possible permutations.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.241
- This is a piece of cake.
- Yeah, Flynn.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.322
Charlene, I've been looking
for you for eight months.

20:11.346 --> 20:14.266
You think an old British lock
is gonna keep me from... ow!

20:15.189 --> 20:16.389
You got yourself out, I see.

20:16.390 --> 20:20.026
I am so glad that you are okay.

20:20.027 --> 20:23.063
Of course I'm okay. I'm always okay.

20:23.064 --> 20:25.231
I did not need you to rescue me.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.467
Well, what are you doing here?

20:27.468 --> 20:29.202
Hiding.

20:29.203 --> 20:31.504
- I didn't want you seeking.
- You're hiding here, why?

20:31.505 --> 20:34.274
It was the last place that
Apep would look for me.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.208
Shangri-La?

20:35.209 --> 20:37.377
No, in Lam's possessions.

20:37.378 --> 20:40.113
If Apep couldn't find me, I
doubt he'd think that Lam could.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.749
In this cage... you've been
in this cage since Peru?

20:42.750 --> 20:45.585
Yeah. It's not the Four Seasons,

20:45.586 --> 20:48.254
but it's three hots and a cot
and the company's not so bad.

20:48.256 --> 20:49.559
Oh, stow it, Phil.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.791
I'll send somebody for you soon enough.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.460
Charlene, if you were in trouble,

20:53.461 --> 20:55.695
why didn't you call me?
I could've helped you.

20:55.696 --> 20:57.430
Because Apep is watching you.

20:57.431 --> 21:00.767
You found me, could Apep be far behind?

21:00.768 --> 21:03.336
But we can stop him.

21:03.337 --> 21:06.806
No, Flynn, you can't.
Apep is not Prospero,

21:06.807 --> 21:09.442
he's not Dulaque, he's an Egyptian god.

21:09.443 --> 21:11.845
And if he gets a hold of
me, he can enter the Library

21:11.846 --> 21:14.948
and release... pure evil.

21:14.949 --> 21:16.892
Okay, well, then we will
hide you someplace else.

21:16.893 --> 21:18.818
I'm sure Jenkins knows
somebody in Atlantis.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.121
I'm heading to the Library.
It's my only option.

21:21.122 --> 21:23.189
What does that mean?

21:23.190 --> 21:25.291
I have to sever my
connection with the Library.

21:25.293 --> 21:27.581
Now that Judson is gone,
Jenkins is the only one

21:27.582 --> 21:28.937
who can perform the ritual.

21:28.938 --> 21:31.198
No, no, you can't do that.
You're the original Guardian.

21:31.199 --> 21:33.622
Your connection to the Library's
the key to your immortality.

21:33.623 --> 21:35.944
Wait, so you're gonna
die to save the Library?

21:35.945 --> 21:40.281
I've had a great run, boys,
but the world is at stake.

21:40.282 --> 21:43.551
It's time for me to say
good-bye to the Library

21:43.552 --> 21:46.421
and to this dimension forever.

21:48.424 --> 21:49.624
No, no.

21:53.996 --> 21:56.197
Those two men just loaded
Baird onto that train.

21:56.198 --> 21:58.032
Where do you think they're taking her?

21:58.033 --> 22:00.501
My money's on the underground
markets of Chengguan.

22:00.502 --> 22:04.439
There you can buy anything or anyone.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.541
All aboard?

22:10.679 --> 22:12.513
You are not leaving this dimension.

22:12.514 --> 22:14.415
I have no choice.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.777
All right, to be continued.

22:15.778 --> 22:17.281
For right now, what about Shangri-La?

22:17.282 --> 22:18.362
Lam's about to take it over

22:18.363 --> 22:19.872
and we're not gonna let that happen.

22:19.873 --> 22:20.955
Lam can take it over,

22:20.956 --> 22:22.323
but only if he has the staff.

22:22.324 --> 22:24.625
He does. And the Monkey King.

22:24.627 --> 22:25.693
And Eve.

22:25.694 --> 22:26.794
Lam has Colonel Baird?

22:26.795 --> 22:28.463
This is what we're saying.

22:28.464 --> 22:31.466
We have to retrieve the
staff, save the city and Eve.

22:31.467 --> 22:32.700
And do it all before sunset.

22:32.701 --> 22:34.135
Seriously?

22:34.136 --> 22:36.104
This is how you run
things when I'm away?

22:36.105 --> 22:39.140
You can help us. We're Librarians,
but you're still a Guardian.

22:39.141 --> 22:41.576
So, what do you say? One more mission?

22:41.577 --> 22:46.080
One more adventure? One
more trip around the thing?

22:51.587 --> 22:54.088
For the last time, I am a US citizen

22:54.089 --> 22:57.291
with contacts in the US
Military and with NATO.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.331
All right.

23:03.332 --> 23:05.099
Let's drop the act.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.201
Your white socks say American.

23:07.202 --> 23:09.670
Your haircut says paramilitary.

23:09.672 --> 23:11.303
I don't know who you're working for,

23:11.304 --> 23:13.608
but you're about to be placed
under arrest for war crimes,

23:13.609 --> 23:18.312
per the NATO charter, by Counter
Terror Chief General Cynthia Rockwell.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.215
Take it away, General.

23:23.018 --> 23:24.485
Release her.

23:24.486 --> 23:28.356
Uh, what's... going on?

23:33.162 --> 23:34.295
These guys work for you?

23:34.296 --> 23:37.098
- Ten-hut!
- Yes, ma'am.

23:38.901 --> 23:43.271
Now, that's my soldier.

23:43.272 --> 23:45.473
Thank you, gentlemen.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.178
Good to see you, Colonel.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.447
Good to see you, too,
but what's going on?

23:52.448 --> 23:54.382
I... I don't understand.

23:54.383 --> 23:56.284
I needed a chat with my protégé,

23:56.285 --> 23:59.253
and your current job made
you difficult to reach.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.757
So you had me kidnapped?

24:02.758 --> 24:04.592
I made a mutually beneficial deal

24:04.593 --> 24:06.994
with a key player in the private sector.

24:06.996 --> 24:09.697
You gave Sterling Lam
the map to Shangri-La.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.334
Not me personally. My agency.

24:13.335 --> 24:16.137
DOSA.

24:16.138 --> 24:17.738
You work for DOSA?

24:17.740 --> 24:21.209
Work for? No, no, no, no.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.777
I'm running it.

24:22.778 --> 24:25.947
That's why it's imperative
that I talk to you

24:25.948 --> 24:29.150
about the sleeper agent in your Library.

24:29.151 --> 24:30.651
Not possible.

24:30.652 --> 24:32.987
If someone were spying on
us, I would know about it.

24:32.988 --> 24:36.724
Eve, you misunderstand me.

24:37.626 --> 24:40.128
That sleeper agent...

24:40.129 --> 24:42.830
is you.

24:50.849 --> 24:55.085
I apologize for keeping you
in the dark. I had no choice,

24:55.087 --> 24:56.767
if you were going to
be an effective asset.

24:56.791 --> 24:58.656
I'm not an asset.

24:58.657 --> 25:01.125
Mm, not a knowing one.

25:01.126 --> 25:03.127
That's what made you so good.

25:04.672 --> 25:06.439
You really think it was a coincidence

25:06.441 --> 25:09.242
that you and Flynn Carsen
wound up in the same German town

25:09.243 --> 25:12.546
hunting for the same WMD
at the exact same time?

25:13.915 --> 25:16.650
We planted the Intel
about that artifact.

25:16.651 --> 25:19.119
We knew he'd come so we sent you in.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.756
- No.
- I authorized your transfer

25:22.757 --> 25:24.591
from NATO counter-intelligence,

25:24.592 --> 25:26.293
get us access to the Library.

25:26.294 --> 25:29.362
Now that you have, it's
time for your wakeup call.

25:29.363 --> 25:30.730
Wake up to do what?

25:30.731 --> 25:34.201
To give us the Library...
the government, DOSA.

25:34.202 --> 25:36.002
I can't do that.

25:36.003 --> 25:38.038
Your job is to protect the United States

25:38.039 --> 25:39.873
from terrorist organizations.

25:39.874 --> 25:41.841
The Library is not a
terrorist organization.

25:41.843 --> 25:43.727
It possesses weapons
of mass destruction.

25:43.728 --> 25:44.911
Those are artifacts.

25:44.912 --> 25:46.746
Weapons that are a
clear and present danger

25:46.747 --> 25:48.882
to the United States and our allies.

25:48.883 --> 25:50.150
You don't understand.

25:50.151 --> 25:52.953
I understand that
airplanes have vanished.

25:52.954 --> 25:56.623
That whole towns have
been hit by mass hysteria.

25:56.624 --> 25:58.825
Innocent people have lost their lives.

25:58.826 --> 26:01.828
All with these Librarians that
happen to be in the center of it all.

26:01.829 --> 26:04.130
Yes, they protect the people.

26:04.132 --> 26:07.801
- From these artifacts?
- It's why the Library exists.

26:07.802 --> 26:09.970
So magical items stay in the hands

26:09.971 --> 26:12.105
of the people who comprehend them.

26:12.106 --> 26:17.244
You mean a failed academic, a
cowboy, a janitor, and a crook?

26:17.245 --> 26:21.047
Clearly you don't understand
these people or what they do.

26:21.048 --> 26:24.417
- But do you?
- Of course, they're my...

26:24.418 --> 26:27.387
Yes, I trust them.

26:27.388 --> 26:30.223
These Librarians, they've never
lied to you about anything?

26:30.224 --> 26:31.491
Never.

26:31.492 --> 26:33.693
Flynn Carsen always told you the truth?

26:33.694 --> 26:35.795
No secrets?

26:35.796 --> 26:39.566
These artifacts, they have
never used any of them?

26:39.567 --> 26:42.769
No, no.

26:42.770 --> 26:46.506
Okay, maybe sometimes,
but always for good.

26:46.507 --> 26:50.677
And are you sure they've
never used any magic on you?

26:50.678 --> 26:52.412
Absolutely not.

26:52.413 --> 26:57.384
But if they did, how would you know?

26:57.385 --> 26:59.085
When Agents go undercover,

26:59.086 --> 27:01.149
there's a percentage of
them that end up identifying

27:01.150 --> 27:03.456
with the groups they're
trying to infiltrate.

27:03.457 --> 27:05.258
It's a form of Stockholm Syndrome.

27:05.259 --> 27:08.662
It can even happen when
magic isn't involved.

27:08.663 --> 27:11.965
General, that's not this. That's...

27:11.966 --> 27:14.134
they're not the enemy.
We're not the enemy.

27:14.135 --> 27:16.336
I know you're not.

27:16.337 --> 27:18.705
You took a bullet for me.

27:18.706 --> 27:22.042
I'll never forget that,
let alone repay it.

27:22.043 --> 27:24.277
That's why I would never lie to you.

27:24.278 --> 27:26.079
But you used me.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.982
I had to get someone into that Library.

27:28.983 --> 27:30.850
The best officer I've ever had.

27:30.851 --> 27:33.019
You're free to go at the next stop.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.854
I just needed to get
you here one-on-one

27:34.855 --> 27:38.658
to find out if they've
used any magic on you.

27:38.659 --> 27:41.361
And, more importantly,
remind you of who you are

27:41.362 --> 27:45.031
and that you swore an oath to
the United States of America.

27:45.032 --> 27:49.402
Now, you gonna hold up to your oath?

27:49.403 --> 27:51.037
Or throw your lot in with the people

27:51.038 --> 27:54.908
you just admitted you can't trust?

27:59.380 --> 28:02.749
All right, in order for Lam to
take possession of Shangri-La,

28:02.750 --> 28:04.984
he has to bring the staff
to the city's magical nexus.

28:04.986 --> 28:07.120
AKA the throne room.

28:07.121 --> 28:09.116
All right, we've got to try and
figure out a way to get up there

28:09.117 --> 28:11.615
now that Lam knows that we
know the secret entrance.

28:11.616 --> 28:15.528
Do you guys always do a
recap before you go on a job?

28:15.529 --> 28:17.764
No wonder your missions take so long.

28:17.765 --> 28:21.768
Flynn, remember when you had
to trap that basilisk in Cyrene?

28:21.769 --> 28:25.338
Yes, wait. That move?
Almost got everybody killed.

28:25.339 --> 28:27.674
All right, guys, I don't
think getting everybody killed

28:27.675 --> 28:29.476
is the right tactic
to get the king back.

28:29.477 --> 28:34.147
There's a big difference between
the way Flynn tried it then and now.

28:34.148 --> 28:35.448
What's that?

28:35.449 --> 28:38.151
We didn't have Charlene as our Guardian.

28:38.152 --> 28:40.320
Damn right.

28:53.267 --> 28:56.069
They switch out every 10
minutes exactly, like clockwork.

28:56.070 --> 28:59.639
Which gives us nine minutes and 40
seconds till the other one comes back.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.709
I'm ready if you are.

29:45.519 --> 29:47.520
Zero, eight, three.

29:47.521 --> 29:50.824
It's a hexadecimal approximation of pi.

29:50.825 --> 29:53.259
It's a hexadecimal approximation of pi.

30:02.603 --> 30:05.171
Look, lady, I don't speak Chinese.

30:11.245 --> 30:13.279
Ah!

30:15.683 --> 30:19.519
- Colonel.
- Ezekiel, what are you doing here?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.521
Rescuing you. Are you all right?

30:21.522 --> 30:24.257
I am now. Let's get out of here.

30:26.727 --> 30:28.094
We're running out of daylight.

30:28.095 --> 30:29.496
Two of them, three of us.

30:29.497 --> 30:31.898
Easy peasy, lemon squeasy.

30:31.899 --> 30:36.202
"Never fear moving forward
slowly; fear only to stand still."

30:36.203 --> 30:38.238
Who said that? Oh! Ah!

30:40.307 --> 30:42.675
He did.

30:47.548 --> 30:49.849
Ooh, red's definitely not his color.

30:49.850 --> 30:52.252
I think Lam put him under
some kind of a spell.

30:52.253 --> 30:54.087
The Murder Harp.

30:54.088 --> 30:55.688
What's the Murder Harp?

30:55.689 --> 30:58.460
Something Lam just recently
acquired for his collection.

30:58.461 --> 31:00.301
Constructed from the
bones from a murdered girl

31:00.325 --> 31:01.435
and strung with her hair.

31:01.436 --> 31:03.196
It corrupts the soul
of all who listen to it.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.690
Tops Jenkins' "Most-Wanted" list.

31:05.691 --> 31:07.425
Stone, give him the "pfft"!

31:08.561 --> 31:11.796
You guys get the staff from Lam.

31:11.798 --> 31:14.132
I got this.

31:19.806 --> 31:22.841
Sifu, please, you don't want to do this.

31:25.311 --> 31:27.212
All right, maybe you do.

31:29.448 --> 31:32.317
When the sun leaves the
throne room of Shangri-La,

31:32.318 --> 31:35.020
whoever holds the staff
will rule the city.

31:35.021 --> 31:38.323
So, where is it?

31:38.324 --> 31:40.225
It's right here.

31:40.226 --> 31:43.328
And so is the man who will kill you!

31:46.149 --> 31:49.348
Uh... he's got a few more
guys that I thought he would.

31:49.428 --> 31:51.696
Yeah. "We're Librarians.
You're a Guardian."

31:51.697 --> 31:53.031
How could I be so gullible?

31:53.032 --> 31:54.866
Well, what do you
suggest, tactical retreat?

31:54.867 --> 31:57.402
Uh...

31:57.403 --> 31:59.404
stall them. I'll be right back.

31:59.405 --> 32:01.940
Stall them?

32:01.941 --> 32:04.075
Uh... rah!

32:18.524 --> 32:20.025
Sifu, it's me!

32:20.026 --> 32:22.961
It's Jacob Stone, okay? Snap out of it!

32:25.565 --> 32:27.332
You defeated me once, Librarian,

32:27.333 --> 32:30.435
but now you'll watch as I
possess all of Shangri-La.

32:30.436 --> 32:32.103
Well, that sounds pretty neat

32:32.104 --> 32:33.838
until you realize what you're giving up.

32:33.839 --> 32:36.441
I give up nothing. Ha! Ha! Ha!

32:36.442 --> 32:38.543
I wouldn't be so sure, Lam.

32:38.544 --> 32:41.246
You take Shangri-La and you tip
the balance between good and evil.

32:41.247 --> 32:43.848
And I'm not talking
about second-rate evil...

32:43.849 --> 32:45.750
people texting in movies.

32:45.751 --> 32:48.286
No, I'm talking full-on
apocalyptic total annihilation.

32:48.287 --> 32:50.388
You take Shangri-La and
you give up your life.

32:50.389 --> 32:52.357
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

32:52.358 --> 32:55.460
Yeah. And what about your associates?

32:55.461 --> 32:57.262
Are they willing to take that risk, too?

32:57.263 --> 32:58.690
What do you mean?

32:58.691 --> 32:59.874
Well, greed comes at a price.

32:59.875 --> 33:01.833
Are you really gonna pay his?

33:01.834 --> 33:04.436
Especially considering what
he's about to do to you?

33:19.819 --> 33:23.421
Sifu, don't make me do this.

33:23.422 --> 33:25.924
Don't make me.

33:25.925 --> 33:29.894
I don't know, Lam. Seems like
you might be losing your leverage.

33:29.895 --> 33:32.530
Just like you did in Siem Reap!

33:32.531 --> 33:34.165
I've lost nothing.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.501
And this time, I will
damage more than your leg.

33:36.502 --> 33:39.337
Ha! Ha! Ha!

33:39.338 --> 33:40.839
It's not too late to give up, Lam.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.807
You could still collect
baseball cards or stamps.

33:42.808 --> 33:45.643
You mean so you can take the
staff for your collection?

33:45.645 --> 33:48.413
That is what your Library
is, after all... a collection.

33:48.414 --> 33:49.848
Just like mine.

33:49.849 --> 33:51.883
The Library is way
more than a collection!

33:53.019 --> 33:55.920
It stands to protect the world!

33:55.921 --> 33:57.422
Really?

33:57.423 --> 34:00.625
If that's so true, why
are you here all alone?

34:00.626 --> 34:03.995
Alone? Oh, I'm not alone.

34:03.996 --> 34:08.867
Ahem.

34:08.868 --> 34:12.137
Some of you possessions
are not very happy with you.

34:12.138 --> 34:15.306
Oh!

34:15.306 --> 34:17.007
Get 'em, Phil.

34:22.748 --> 34:24.983
- No!
- Ah-ah, not so fast, Lam.

34:24.984 --> 34:27.252
You should've taken my offer
when you had the chance.

34:32.725 --> 34:34.859
Flynn, the sun's about to set!

34:38.330 --> 34:39.429
I can't.

34:39.431 --> 34:40.864
I can't kill you.

34:46.237 --> 34:49.239
Stone, the staff!

35:07.793 --> 35:11.296
All right, I know
your soul is corrupted,

35:11.297 --> 35:14.899
but if anything can make it
pure again, it is this staff,

35:14.900 --> 35:18.670
a symbol of all the goodness
that you brought to this place.

35:18.671 --> 35:22.841
You told me a warrior fights
with the wisdom in his soul.

35:22.842 --> 35:27.011
Okay? If you got any wisdom
in there, fight for your soul!

35:40.092 --> 35:42.794
Jacob?

35:42.795 --> 35:43.928
Sifu?

35:49.135 --> 35:50.702
You okay?

35:50.703 --> 35:54.372
A man who eats crackers in
bed wakes up feeling crumby.

35:58.010 --> 36:01.145
But Shangri-La is still mine.

36:01.147 --> 36:02.780
It is?

36:02.782 --> 36:04.816
Yes, Jacob, you could've killed me.

36:04.817 --> 36:09.120
But instead you saved
my soul with your own.

36:20.634 --> 36:23.135
And there you have your reward.

36:23.136 --> 36:24.436
What is it?

36:24.437 --> 36:25.671
The will of the staff.

36:25.672 --> 36:28.407
Magic? No magic. Take it off.

36:28.408 --> 36:30.175
I cannot.

36:30.177 --> 36:31.377
What does it do?

36:31.378 --> 36:33.746
It is the gift of the inner soul.

36:33.747 --> 36:37.516
With it, you may bring light
where there is only darkness.

36:37.517 --> 36:39.184
Okay, does that mean, Sifu?

36:39.186 --> 36:41.153
You will know when it is time.

36:41.154 --> 36:42.821
For now, go, Jacob.

36:42.823 --> 36:45.991
With thanks from all of Shangri-La.

37:03.009 --> 37:04.877
Everything looks beautiful.

37:04.878 --> 37:08.380
Well, for the Guardian
who helped save Shangri-La,

37:08.381 --> 37:10.749
everything had to be just right.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.085
I meant to thank you
for all the kindnesses

37:13.086 --> 37:15.187
you've shown me over the years.

37:15.188 --> 37:16.522
I hope it's not too late.

37:16.523 --> 37:19.725
For us, it's never too late.

37:19.726 --> 37:22.361
In fact, if you'd like to reconsider...

37:22.362 --> 37:24.096
I can't. I know you mean well, but...

37:24.097 --> 37:27.499
Ah, Charlene, please,
damn it. I don't mean well.

37:30.103 --> 37:31.863
I love you.

37:33.275 --> 37:35.441
Oh, my gosh. Jenkins had
said that he pledged himself

37:35.442 --> 37:37.076
to someone who loved another.

37:37.077 --> 37:40.079
- I had no idea that person was...
- Charlene.

37:40.080 --> 37:45.584
The sun still rises
and sets in your eyes.

37:45.585 --> 37:48.420
Your soul is the only place
I have ever found peace...

37:48.421 --> 37:52.124
Oh, Galahad, please don't.

37:52.125 --> 37:56.528
You are the bravest, boldest, most
loyal knight I have ever known.

37:56.529 --> 38:00.232
You would've made a fine Librarian.

38:00.233 --> 38:03.502
But still my heart
belongs to someone else.

38:03.503 --> 38:06.038
And that is who I must return to now.

38:06.039 --> 38:09.908
Yes. I understand.

38:09.910 --> 38:13.879
It's just... well, it sucks.

38:17.851 --> 38:19.852
Before I go...

38:22.889 --> 38:28.227
Jacob, Cassandra, Ezekiel,

38:28.228 --> 38:30.596
you all have such amazing gifts.

38:30.597 --> 38:33.699
I'm sure the Library
will be in good hands.

38:37.370 --> 38:40.572
- Guardian?
- Guardian?

38:50.750 --> 38:52.618
Flynn...

38:52.619 --> 38:54.887
Charlene, you were amazing today.

38:54.888 --> 38:57.156
And we had an adventure.

38:57.157 --> 38:59.458
And it was a great adventure.

38:59.459 --> 39:01.460
And that doesn't have to stop.

39:01.461 --> 39:02.828
You don't have to do this.

39:02.829 --> 39:05.030
Yes, I do.

39:05.031 --> 39:07.733
Sometimes we have to make sacrifices,

39:07.734 --> 39:10.803
as hard as that is for those around us.

39:10.804 --> 39:15.874
But more than anyone, you
understand the sacrifice I make.

39:16.776 --> 39:19.078
Don't you?

39:19.079 --> 39:21.713
Yes, I do.

39:21.715 --> 39:25.651
I remember a young man who
couldn't get out of his own way.

39:25.652 --> 39:30.589
Sure, he could diagnose
parajugular lymph nodes on sight,

39:30.590 --> 39:34.259
or recite ancient Aramaic
or tell an old lady

39:34.260 --> 39:37.629
how many cats she has by the
number of hairs on her shirt.

39:37.630 --> 39:40.365
Three.

39:40.367 --> 39:43.669
But he didn't understand life.

39:43.670 --> 39:45.370
Oh, I have had the immense pleasure

39:45.372 --> 39:47.639
of watching that young man grow

39:47.640 --> 39:51.477
to be the finest Librarian
that I have ever known.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.848
I'm gonna miss you.

39:58.318 --> 40:00.586
I'll see you again.

40:05.825 --> 40:07.926
Good-bye, Charlene.

40:14.434 --> 40:18.403
- Before I go...
- Oh, yes, we know.

40:18.405 --> 40:20.906
Keep our receipts.

40:30.650 --> 40:31.950
I'm ready.

40:41.828 --> 40:43.795
Good-bye, Galahad.

40:46.099 --> 40:49.601
Good-bye, my love.
