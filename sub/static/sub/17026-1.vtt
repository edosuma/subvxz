WEBVTT

00:05.750 --> 00:07.477
There. You got us.

00:07.489 --> 00:09.923
- Gates is my boyfriend.
- Ah, you got in!

00:10.816 --> 00:14.877
It's a little on the pricey side,
but for you, there will be a discount.

00:14.913 --> 00:17.155
You can't abandon me
in the middle of my training.

00:17.203 --> 00:19.257
- You're not my responsibility.
- You need to get laid.

00:19.303 --> 00:22.145
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah, I'm pretty certain of it.

00:23.793 --> 00:26.430
We're going to be okay.
So let's just get past it.

00:26.595 --> 00:28.198
Let's just go someplace new.

00:28.213 --> 00:30.362
We've got room for one more.
Who's it going to be?

00:40.387 --> 00:42.910
Gates, the board is a mess.
You're only seeing three patients.

00:42.935 --> 00:44.945
- Feel free to pitch in.
- No, no, no, my job

00:44.979 --> 00:48.619
is to supervise and teach.
Your job is to move the meat.

00:48.730 --> 00:51.880
You know , when I was a resident,
I had what was called a work ethic.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.470
- Yes, you set the bar high.
- You bet I did.

00:54.535 --> 00:56.533
And now, as an attending--
it's not as easy as it looks.

00:56.576 --> 00:58.150
I gotta keep a close
eye on all you guys.

00:59.506 --> 01:02.391
Exam Three is clear. Bring me
syncope, impetigo and nausea.

01:02.418 --> 01:04.510
Poor guy... heard he just quit.

01:04.617 --> 01:05.670
No way.

01:05.707 --> 01:07.850
- I'm looking for Dr. Lockhart.
- Me, too.

01:07.906 --> 01:10.743
When you see her, tell her
I need one more prescription.

01:10.777 --> 01:12.613
- He's got something in his eye. He can't see.
- What happened?

01:12.636 --> 01:14.820
- We were down the street from the expsision
- Explosion?

01:14.837 --> 01:17.003
Over on Michigan,
they said it was an ambulance.

01:17.188 --> 01:20.042
- Who went in that rig?
- Get Bardelli on the radio.

01:20.096 --> 01:21.901
Set up the trauma rooms.

01:22.937 --> 01:24.970
- Dumar, you seen Sam?
- No.

01:25.008 --> 01:27.152
- All right, let's roll.
- I didn't get a call.

01:27.925 --> 01:31.003
Unit 62, respond
to an explosion and car fire.

01:31.036 --> 01:33.222
800 block South Michigan.

01:33.445 --> 01:36.522
This is Unit 62 responding.
Go! Drive!

01:38.796 --> 01:41.072
Hold on, hold on...
Hold on! Hold on!

02:23.846 --> 02:25.231
Greg, are you okay?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.060
Yeah, I think so.
What about...

02:27.297 --> 02:29.581
what about the guys in the back?

02:31.917 --> 02:33.150
Hey, Bardelli.

02:33.205 --> 02:35.063
Hey, Bards, come on, wake up, man.

02:35.116 --> 02:37.211
Ma'am, you need to sit
and wait for the paramedics.

02:37.267 --> 02:38.932
I'm an E.R. doc at County;
so's he.

02:38.976 --> 02:41.681
- Yeah, we can help.
- All right, you can assess him, but that's it.

02:41.736 --> 02:43.820
How's your neck?
Any pain?

02:43.875 --> 02:45.422
My stomach...

02:46.195 --> 02:49.170
- Oh, man!
- Dannaker, we need a saw.

02:49.555 --> 02:51.930
You get your guy to the sidewalk.
I got him.

02:52.028 --> 02:53.893
All right, just hang in there, Bards.

02:54.138 --> 02:56.111
Take it easy.
Take it slow.

02:57.528 --> 02:59.252
Abby, what are you doing here?

02:59.568 --> 03:01.893
- Wrong place, wrong time.
- How's your breathing?

03:02.236 --> 03:04.893
- Something hit my jaw.
- All right, sit down.

03:05.258 --> 03:07.033
I think I broke my wrist.

03:07.117 --> 03:08.453
Bardelli's impaled.

03:08.478 --> 03:11.160
We need two large bore I.V.s,
some O-2...

03:11.208 --> 03:13.501
Don't worry about it. They're on it,
okay? You're the patient now.

03:13.516 --> 03:15.641
- You two, sit down.
- I can work with one hand.

03:15.705 --> 03:17.523
Oh, come on, guys, this is stupid.

03:17.636 --> 03:20.072
- We can be helping out, triaging.
- Have you been walking on this?

03:20.105 --> 03:22.763
- You have an open fracture.
- Just stings a little.

03:22.806 --> 03:24.480
Irrigate with saline.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.420
It's just a little blood.
I'm all right.

03:43.215 --> 03:48.350
Sous-titres : Willow's Team
www.forom.com

04:02.446 --> 04:04.892
- You know, when I said I thought you needed...
- Shut up.

04:10.356 --> 04:11.630
We've got trauma.

04:11.678 --> 04:14.123
Okay, everyone needs
to sign in at the window.

04:14.178 --> 04:15.830
We'll get to you as soon as we can.

04:15.877 --> 04:17.372
Coming through.
Clear a path.

04:17.435 --> 04:19.051
- Gates, are they okay?
- Yeah, so far.

04:19.075 --> 04:20.832
Come on, come on, out of the way--
move, move, move!

04:20.875 --> 04:23.151
- How you doing, Bards?
- Pressure's up to 90.

04:23.178 --> 04:24.453
Hold an O.R. for him.

04:24.477 --> 04:26.401
Hey, Greg.
Sorry about this.

04:26.608 --> 04:29.173
- Broken jaw, open fibula.
- Pulse ox is borderline.

04:29.206 --> 04:30.583
Hang tough, Greg.

04:32.608 --> 04:33.981
Oh, God, what happened?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.753
He's got a facial fracture,
he shouldn't talk.

04:35.778 --> 04:37.733
Neela, Brenner,
I need you with Bardelli in Two.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.483
- We're on it.
- One, two, three...

04:41.065 --> 04:43.341
Trauma panel, chest,
facial series and tib-fib.

04:43.376 --> 04:45.673
- Need an ultrasound for a FAST.
- Sats 93, up him to five.

04:45.705 --> 04:48.543
- Open up, buddy.
- I need a gram of Ancef, 100 of gent.

04:48.605 --> 04:50.341
Some jelly for the belly.

04:51.147 --> 04:53.381
Small lac to the oropharynx...

04:54.138 --> 04:57.572
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Everybody stop, stop, stop!

04:57.767 --> 05:00.260
All right, get me one percent
with epi... gel foam.

05:00.347 --> 05:02.841
Morris and Sam, you stay here.
Abby, go fix your wrist.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.482
- Gates, get in there with Bardelli.
- I'm fine. I don't need...

05:05.508 --> 05:07.093
Go, go! Go.

05:08.357 --> 05:11.731
You heard the man.
27 gauge on a three cc syringe.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.403
Hey, Brenner!

05:13.945 --> 05:16.073
You better be aching in there, man.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.303
- All right, come on.
- What do you guys need?

05:19.378 --> 05:22.033
Lateral c-spine.
Deep breath, please. How is he?

05:22.066 --> 05:24.940
- He's good enough to boss us around.
- Kaya, pre-op antibiotics.

05:25.028 --> 05:27.410
Ceftriaxone covers gram
positives and negatives.

05:27.475 --> 05:30.000
Okay, but not the anaerobes.
Ertepenum gets 'em all.

05:30.036 --> 05:32.000
Tony, you mind calling my mom?

05:32.197 --> 05:33.963
I don't want her
to hear something on the news...

05:34.008 --> 05:35.651
- No problem.
- First unit of O-neg is up.

05:35.676 --> 05:37.882
- Might as well intubate.
- What for? He's got a good airway.

05:37.906 --> 05:40.443
- He's going to need it for surgery.
- That's why we have anesthesiologists.

05:40.475 --> 05:42.730
I'm gonna put in a central line
and take him right up to the O.R.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.933
I'm going to go make that call.
You guys all right?

05:46.037 --> 05:47.232
Yeah.

05:52.406 --> 05:54.732
- How's that feel?
- Much better.

05:54.777 --> 05:56.603
Oh, there you are.

05:56.635 --> 05:59.002
Mrs. Gaines, this is really
not a good time.

05:59.037 --> 06:01.003
Oh... oh, dear.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.272
- Yeah, shall I...?
- Come back later.

06:03.305 --> 06:04.591
Oh, yes.

06:06.935 --> 06:09.131
Did I see Luka stop by today?

06:10.857 --> 06:11.981
And...?

06:12.436 --> 06:14.491
And I think things
are going to be okay.

06:15.098 --> 06:16.750
I'm glad to hear that.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.210
Everything was going really well...

06:19.467 --> 06:21.310
until the ambulance blew up.

06:23.837 --> 06:25.703
How about we X-ray your ankle now?

06:25.738 --> 06:27.073
It's just a sprain.

06:27.405 --> 06:28.772
Thank you.

06:30.437 --> 06:31.922
Hold up here.
I'll take those.

06:34.267 --> 06:38.371
- Bleeding stopped with epi.
- Yeah, I told you it would.

06:40.575 --> 06:42.453
- This doesn't make sense.
- What?

06:43.378 --> 06:46.182
There's no fracture.
The tibia and fibula are intact.

06:46.428 --> 06:48.141
- Did they X-ray the wrong leg?
- No.

06:53.157 --> 06:55.693
Pratt, that's not your bone.

06:56.336 --> 06:57.332
What?

06:57.388 --> 07:00.341
- It's a two inch bony fragment.
- Yeah, someone else's.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.583
- Someone from the back of the rig?
- Most likely.

07:02.618 --> 07:04.232
Ugh, gnarly.

07:06.788 --> 07:08.433
Good thing you sat up front.

07:08.666 --> 07:09.733
Yeah.

07:09.978 --> 07:11.622
Let me numb it up.

07:12.716 --> 07:14.223
No, just pull it out.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.383
- Without local?
- You sure?

07:16.397 --> 07:18.601
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:31.627 --> 07:33.501
Send that up for HIV and hepatitis.

07:33.795 --> 07:36.813
- Pulse ox down to 88.
- Put him on 100%.

07:36.837 --> 07:39.990
- Pneumothorax on the chest X-ray?
- No diffuse bilateral contusions.

07:40.038 --> 07:41.522
Blast lungs.

07:41.575 --> 07:44.023
The shock wave caused bleeding
and bruising throughout the chest.

07:44.278 --> 07:45.691
I know.

07:46.338 --> 07:48.292
It might get worse
before it gets better.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.993
I'll get the non-rebreather.

07:55.338 --> 07:56.822
How come he's not in the O.R.?

07:56.875 --> 07:59.160
Surgery wants a central line first.

07:59.385 --> 08:01.525
- How you doing, Lou?
- Hangin' in there.

08:01.539 --> 08:02.789
How's Greg?

08:02.980 --> 08:04.630
Sats are down.

08:06.849 --> 08:08.462
Hang two more O-neg.

08:09.007 --> 08:11.413
We're giving her a real-time
guidance in the sterile field.

08:11.446 --> 08:13.632
- Is that the I.J.?
- Perfect.

08:13.676 --> 08:16.252
- Can you see, Doctor?
- It's crystal clear.

08:16.327 --> 08:19.062
- Decreased breath sounds.
- Pulse ox is dropping.

08:19.108 --> 08:21.381
The damaged alveoli
are filling with fluid.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.683
We need to talk about intubation, Greg.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.500
Okay...

08:27.716 --> 08:29.822
- Let's do it.
- Etomidate and sux are ready.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.821
- Push it.
- Lower his head.

08:32.298 --> 08:34.183
Assisting ventilations.

08:35.905 --> 08:36.789
Morris...

08:37.498 --> 08:39.073
Don't screw this up.

08:53.646 --> 08:55.503
Abby, you want to give it a try?

08:55.617 --> 08:56.901
With this?

08:59.178 --> 09:00.131
Gates...?

09:00.388 --> 09:02.183
- I think he wanted you to do it.
- Okay, you know,

09:02.217 --> 09:03.902
I need to take a step back

09:03.937 --> 09:06.940
and keep an eye on the big picture.
I'm running this, you're doing it.

09:08.358 --> 09:11.130
All right, laryngoscope and suction.

09:11.197 --> 09:12.583
Sats up to 90.

09:13.867 --> 09:15.791
I need a doctor in here.

09:17.656 --> 09:18.730
I got it.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.662
- Check the cuff.
- We have an end-tidal detector?

09:20.676 --> 09:22.253
- Yes, it's ready to go.
- This is Jasmine.

09:22.276 --> 09:25.632
She has tight wheezing,
she was in the back of a burning car.

09:25.775 --> 09:27.583
I couldn't get my seat belt off.

09:28.278 --> 09:30.200
That must have been scary, huh?

09:30.547 --> 09:33.280
Can you sit forward?
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

09:33.998 --> 09:36.313
I have moderate persistent asthma.

09:36.337 --> 09:38.580
I'm on inhaled Beclomethasone,

09:38.608 --> 09:42.572
Albuterol, and an oral
leukotriene modifier.

09:43.217 --> 09:44.632
Wow, you know a lot.

09:46.078 --> 09:47.712
Can you tilt your head back?

09:47.927 --> 09:49.882
- Who's with her?
- Uh, the nanny.

09:49.908 --> 09:53.052
- She's calling her mom right now.
- Okay, no evidence of thermal damage.

09:53.105 --> 09:54.243
I'll be back.

09:54.277 --> 09:56.670
Keep her on ten an hour;
order a portable chest.

09:56.705 --> 09:57.993
You got it.

09:58.808 --> 10:00.371
- Do you see the cords?
- Too much blood.

10:00.427 --> 10:02.032
What about cricoid?

10:03.115 --> 10:04.942
Anatomy's distorted.
Now you're making it worse.

10:05.008 --> 10:06.970
Pulse ox down to 80.

10:10.538 --> 10:12.410
All right that's enough, bag him up.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.172
You do this, Arch--
you're better at it.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.552
Here, come on.

10:20.706 --> 10:22.881
Open up a 7-O and a bougie.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.012
I need the rapid infuser.

10:25.037 --> 10:27.072
- What's going with Bardelli?
- He might be bleeding out.

10:27.106 --> 10:28.773
- Neela still in there?
- Oh, yeah.

10:28.806 --> 10:31.161
- Let's take another look.
- We're here if she needs us.

10:32.558 --> 10:34.540
- Chuny?
- They're tubing him.

10:34.757 --> 10:37.473
- It's not slowing down.
- Okay, apply more pressure.

10:38.075 --> 10:40.483
The blood's from deeper inside.
Maybe a mesenteric artery.

10:40.505 --> 10:42.563
- You need to take him to the O.R.
- You over-transfused,

10:42.607 --> 10:45.332
got his pressure way up and he blew
a clot-- he was fine when he got here.

10:45.377 --> 10:47.103
Why didn't you say something
when I ordered the blood?

10:47.128 --> 10:49.600
I didn't hear.
I was busy with the central line.

10:49.825 --> 10:51.362
Okay, what do we got?

10:51.908 --> 10:54.520
Through and through abdominal
penetration, exit wound hemorrhage.

10:54.535 --> 10:56.953
TKO the fluids, hang FFP
and platelets; let's take him up.

10:57.006 --> 10:58.800
- Are you back at work?
- Heard the news on the radio,

10:58.816 --> 11:01.211
I'm still on duty,
I figured you might need my help.

11:01.806 --> 11:04.030
Crap, they still haven't got it.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.642
- I see the epiglottis.
- That's as far as I got, too.

11:08.676 --> 11:10.801
- Everything's pushed to the right.
- Use my hand as a guide

11:10.818 --> 11:13.540
- and I'll hold when you see the cords.
- Sats are drifting down...

11:16.528 --> 11:19.581
- Forget it. There's no way.
- You want to try the bougie?

11:19.676 --> 11:21.170
I can't see the larynx.

11:21.388 --> 11:23.530
- Fiber optic's here.
- I'll set it up.

11:23.575 --> 11:25.783
- There's too much blood for that.
- You want to try again?

11:25.975 --> 11:29.020
He-he-he-he needs oxygen.
He needs a crike.

11:29.075 --> 11:31.372
- We could try to go retrograde?
- I said we're criking.

11:31.435 --> 11:33.361
- No crike trays.
- Check the hall.

11:33.377 --> 11:36.542
- Pulse ox is in the 70s.
- Okay, forget the tray.

11:36.577 --> 11:39.180
- I need an 11 blade and a Shiley.
- I got a ten blade here.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.822
Where the hell are the Shileys?

11:41.045 --> 11:43.553
Run a V-tach.
Open the crash cart.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.592
- Sam, you have bandage scissors?
- Uh, yeah.

11:45.606 --> 11:46.831
Get over here.

11:48.535 --> 11:50.772
Morris, what are you doing?
Bag him.

11:52.416 --> 11:54.013
- What are you doing?!
- Morris!

11:58.187 --> 12:00.312
Okay, cut the drip chamber, right here.

12:05.806 --> 12:07.012
Bag him up.

12:12.877 --> 12:14.600
Good chest rise.

12:14.638 --> 12:16.411
What the hell was that?

12:16.787 --> 12:18.340
Sats coming up.

12:18.966 --> 12:21.182
All right. All right!

12:22.167 --> 12:24.113
You still need a crike tray?

12:26.107 --> 12:28.702
- Rose Franklin, ten-foot fall.
- Another one from the explosion?

12:28.718 --> 12:30.581
Yeah, got knocked down an access well.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.451
- Concussion, hip fracture.
- Okay, warm up the head CT.

12:33.706 --> 12:35.352
One, two, three.

12:35.876 --> 12:37.752
Ma'am are you having any pain?

12:38.995 --> 12:42.061
Trauma panel, UA, type and hold,
c-spine, chest and pelvis.

12:42.927 --> 12:45.751
- How you doing, Rose?
- Norman Chapman, tibia fracture.

12:45.775 --> 12:48.530
- Hey, Rose, it's Norman. I'm right here.
- He's a relative?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.311
No, no, no,
she's a complete and total stranger.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.731
Norman's a real hero.
He jumped right in to save her.

12:52.798 --> 12:55.013
Yeah. Ten feet down at least, right?

12:55.076 --> 12:56.231
At least.

12:56.687 --> 12:59.791
I broke my leg when I landed, and then
I crawled out with her on my back.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.842
Wow. Okay, start
your primary assessment.

13:04.828 --> 13:06.523
Hey, am I gonna have to miss work?

13:07.117 --> 13:09.693
- What do you do?
- Uh, I'm a Web site debugger.

13:09.716 --> 13:13.271
- Like a programmer?
- Uh, not really. I beta-test Web sites.

13:13.305 --> 13:16.181
I click on 'em a couple thousand times.
Try to get 'em to crash.

13:16.745 --> 13:19.452
Hey, Chuny, heard
they brought Bardelli in.

13:19.506 --> 13:22.472
- Yeah, they took him up to the O.R.
- Who's he riding with?

13:23.775 --> 13:25.621
We're gonna have
to wire his jaw in the O.R.

13:25.637 --> 13:28.351
and he'll go to
the ICU until his lungs heal.

13:28.525 --> 13:31.223
With all the facial trauma,
we had to crike him.

13:32.785 --> 13:35.781
His vitals are stable,
he's oxygenating well.

13:36.387 --> 13:38.020
Do you have any questions?

13:39.196 --> 13:40.470
I'm good.

13:40.897 --> 13:42.793
Inflate the cuff, hook up the vent.

13:42.818 --> 13:43.933
Hi, Chaz.

13:44.486 --> 13:46.112
How you doing, man?

13:47.346 --> 13:49.033
You can't talk with that thing?

13:50.206 --> 13:52.852
Good. So you get to listen
to me tell everybody

13:52.907 --> 13:55.490
about how many times
I kicked your ass on the court.

13:58.548 --> 14:00.202
"I'm busy now.

14:00.235 --> 14:02.403
Can I ignore you some other time?"

14:02.788 --> 14:04.420
I'll check on you later, okay?

14:06.665 --> 14:09.182
- Dr. Lockhart, Mrs. Escalante.
- Hi.

14:09.218 --> 14:11.490
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello. How's she doing?

14:11.518 --> 14:15.330
Um, okay, well,
her pulse ox is up to a hundred,

14:15.377 --> 14:17.303
which is good-- ow!

14:17.926 --> 14:20.660
- You're funny.
- Jasmine, come on, honey.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.650
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:22.708 --> 14:25.513
- You don't look fine.
- She's acting a little weird.

14:25.536 --> 14:27.243
Can you sit up, sweetie?

14:29.358 --> 14:31.382
The wheezing's improved.

14:33.025 --> 14:34.770
- Dropped her BP.
- What's happening?

14:34.808 --> 14:38.312
Bolus 250 of saline, a repeat
CBC and abdominal ultrasound--

14:38.337 --> 14:41.250
- I need to check for internal bleeding.
- Well, shouldn't you have done that before?

14:41.275 --> 14:43.440
I mean, you've been
in the other room this whole time.

14:48.247 --> 14:49.720
What's up with his neck?

14:50.448 --> 14:52.461
That wasn't there before.

14:56.236 --> 14:58.903
- Get Surgery right now!
- Call for four units.

15:05.878 --> 15:07.611
There's a pulsatile mass.

15:07.658 --> 15:08.982
It's expanding.

15:14.558 --> 15:17.003
There's no bleeding
in the chest or abdomen.

15:17.035 --> 15:18.651
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.

15:18.677 --> 15:20.701
- I'm checking on a bunch of things.
- Mom.

15:20.715 --> 15:23.413
See you soon as I get
some more results, okay?

15:25.387 --> 15:27.183
Hey, excuse me.
Are you a doctor?

15:27.788 --> 15:29.932
- Yeah.
- Do you think my leg is broken?

15:29.987 --> 15:32.552
X ray's been ordered.
Never rock against the teeth.

15:33.005 --> 15:34.863
Um, you know what?

15:36.148 --> 15:37.363
Does this hurt?

15:38.896 --> 15:40.393
It's probably fractured.

15:40.677 --> 15:42.552
Hey, I jumped into
a courtyard to save that lady.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.393
- Really?
- You see the cords?

15:44.415 --> 15:45.122
Yeah.

15:45.177 --> 15:48.133
Every day, for my afternoon break,
I get a pop and I get pretzels

15:48.207 --> 15:49.812
from the snack bar on the fourtr.

15:49.837 --> 15:52.042
But today I thought, "You know what?
I'm gonna get a burger."

15:52.106 --> 15:54.033
And it was like fate just put
me there to save her.

15:54.448 --> 15:56.610
- That's great.
- I'm in. Bag her.

15:57.777 --> 16:00.313
She was talking when I brought
her in-- is she gonna be okay?

16:00.357 --> 16:02.350
- You know, I'm, I'm not really...
- It's a possible epidural.

16:02.406 --> 16:05.330
- We're gonna take her to head CT.
- Ah, she's strong. She'll pull through.

16:05.418 --> 16:08.531
Okay, I have to...
I don't know how I did it.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.102
I was in pain, I was desperate,
and I was in a deep hole.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.523
And then I remembered:
"When you feel like there's no hope

16:14.576 --> 16:16.632
- "and you're at the end of your rope...
- Hey, what's the rush?

16:16.678 --> 16:19.712
- It's Greg.
- and there's a hero inside of you."

16:20.686 --> 16:22.721
The song was right!

16:24.287 --> 16:26.490
- Okay, we need a second Yankauer!
- Hang another two units.

16:26.516 --> 16:28.971
- What happened?
- Expanding neck hematoma.

16:29.226 --> 16:31.723
- He dehisced the lac.
- Get a sponge stick on it.

16:31.738 --> 16:34.021
- Do you think he's gonna aspirate?
- No, the trach tube has a cuff.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.591
- Open up, Greg.
- He was doing okay.

16:36.636 --> 16:38.721
I think a piece
of mandible cut his carotid.

16:38.775 --> 16:40.912
- Should have seen this sooner.
- Unless you cut the wall of the artery

16:40.936 --> 16:42.750
- and it took time to blow.
- Got it.

16:42.778 --> 16:45.913
- Okay, betadine and cutdown tray.
- What are you doing?

16:45.976 --> 16:48.981
- I need to tie off his carotid.
- Tie off his carotid?

16:49.036 --> 16:51.803
- It'll cut off the blood to half his brain.
- Right-sided paralysis and aphasia.

16:51.818 --> 16:54.340
- He's got collateral through the circle of Willis.
- You hope.

16:55.897 --> 16:58.030
There's an open artery.
I can either let him bleed out

16:58.077 --> 16:59.803
or we can accept the risk of a stroke.

16:59.835 --> 17:02.203
You think he's gonna die if you don't?

17:08.298 --> 17:09.861
You understand?

17:12.365 --> 17:13.883
Should I call Dad?

17:15.005 --> 17:16.661
How about Betina?

17:17.526 --> 17:19.133
I'll try her cell.

17:19.846 --> 17:21.833
There's some burning with lido.

17:23.436 --> 17:25.163
Abby, right now.

17:29.016 --> 17:31.371
Multi-focal PVCs runs of V-tach.

17:31.778 --> 17:33.290
Where's the blood gas?

17:36.545 --> 17:39.161
- Her pH is really low.
- What is that?

17:39.416 --> 17:41.132
- Superficial bleeders.
- Hemostats.

17:41.177 --> 17:44.750
They haven't enough doctors in there,
okay? My daughter needs you!

17:48.206 --> 17:52.112
Um, she's got a profound gap acidosis
but her oxygen level is normal.

17:52.135 --> 17:53.733
Did she ingest anything?

17:53.768 --> 17:55.750
Uh, yeah. That's it.

17:55.928 --> 17:58.202
That's probably it.
Cyanide.

17:58.866 --> 18:01.851
Mix two grams of hydroxo-cobalamin.
That's the antidote.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.932
Sometimes when a car interior burns,
it releases cyanide.

18:05.196 --> 18:07.211
As soon as it gets here,
we'll give it to her.

18:07.445 --> 18:09.583
Fix the light!
I can't see a damn thing.

18:09.618 --> 18:12.540
- Try to stop the blood!
- Stop, stop!

18:12.797 --> 18:14.831
Shh! Quiet! Let her work.

18:18.987 --> 18:20.910
Releasing the clamp.

18:25.326 --> 18:26.721
Fid is dry.

18:27.618 --> 18:28.870
Morris?

18:36.457 --> 18:37.923
- You got it.
- All right.

18:39.168 --> 18:40.951
I'll close with steri-strips.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.201
Systolic at 100.

18:46.268 --> 18:47.262
Give me that.

18:47.306 --> 18:49.370
You're supposed to run
this in over 30 minutes.

18:49.695 --> 18:50.763
Is that safe?

18:50.816 --> 18:53.233
It's okay to push it faster
if the heart's in trouble.

18:53.287 --> 18:55.973
This binds with the cyanida.

18:58.268 --> 19:00.323
- Normal sinus.
- See? She's coming around.

19:01.297 --> 19:02.842
- V-fib!
- Damn it!

19:03.137 --> 19:05.660
- Starting compressions!
- Call for bypass!

19:05.707 --> 19:08.002
14 French femoral catheters.

19:16.797 --> 19:18.830
Trauma One.
They're waiting for you.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.302
Somebody going on bypass?

19:23.145 --> 19:24.500
It's Pratt.

19:24.718 --> 19:26.440
They're doing CPR.

19:30.765 --> 19:33.482
- Lines are primed.
- Clear of bubbles. Ready to go.

19:36.666 --> 19:39.462
We can stop the bagging and
the compressions because the bypass... 

19:40.008 --> 19:42.240
It does all the work
of the heart and the lungs.

19:43.147 --> 19:45.262
- Pulse ox is coming up.
- That's good.

19:46.668 --> 19:48.282
He's in an agonal rhythm.

19:48.658 --> 19:50.181
We don't treat it now.

19:50.298 --> 19:52.320
We wait for the bypass to work.

19:55.165 --> 19:58.183
- Is it a compound fracture?
- No, it's spiral.

19:58.635 --> 20:00.613
You have to fall a long way
to get a spiral fracture?

20:00.635 --> 20:04.441
- Yeah, it takes a bit of force.
- Yeah, I know.

20:04.665 --> 20:07.122
- Kaya, did you hear about how this happened?
- Several times.

20:07.585 --> 20:09.870
Swelling, but no bleed on head CT.

20:10.038 --> 20:11.492
Excellent!

20:12.028 --> 20:14.370
Actually, that's a bad concussion.

20:15.276 --> 20:17.861
And a nasty pelvic fracture.

20:18.038 --> 20:20.773
Hey, you doing okay, Rose?
It's Norman.

20:20.996 --> 20:22.110
I'm right here.

20:22.186 --> 20:23.532
Hey, open your eyes.

20:24.655 --> 20:26.383
That might take a bit of time.

20:27.927 --> 20:28.983
How long?

20:30.027 --> 20:31.332
I can't really say.

20:36.096 --> 20:37.952
All leads are isoelectric.

20:38.547 --> 20:40.441
So his brain's not working?

20:40.915 --> 20:42.311
Not right now.

20:43.988 --> 20:47.032
- He wasn't down for that long.
- We started CPR right away.

20:47.076 --> 20:49.010
He never had prolonged hypoxia.

20:51.257 --> 20:53.951
- Could have been an air embolus.
- That would do it.

20:54.085 --> 20:56.731
A blast injury puts
air into the circulation.

20:56.785 --> 20:59.031
And the air goes up into the brain.

21:01.965 --> 21:03.183
And that's it?

21:03.486 --> 21:05.560
The brain can still recover.

21:05.997 --> 21:09.470
We'll wait four hours, then
we'll check Auditory Evoked Responses

21:09.498 --> 21:13.232
and an Apnea Test
before making any decisions.

21:14.717 --> 21:15.992
I'll come back.

21:16.498 --> 21:18.180
We should get Betina.

21:18.966 --> 21:21.840
I left a message on her cell.
Keep trying.

21:39.915 --> 21:43.340
Listen, I don't think
we all need to be in here.

21:46.948 --> 21:48.973
There's nothing more we can do for now.

21:54.517 --> 21:55.930
We'll take shifts.

21:56.717 --> 21:58.353
There's a lot of patients.

21:59.246 --> 22:02.143
He would tell us to get out
there and take care of business.

22:03.268 --> 22:04.731
That's what he'd say.

22:06.817 --> 22:08.182
Tony?

22:31.198 --> 22:33.450
- Check a crit.
- Is she bleeding in her pelvis?

22:33.506 --> 22:36.323
Wasn't that impressive on the CT.
Maybe we got behind on her fluids.

22:36.377 --> 22:38.252
- I want to push vitamin K.
- What for?

22:38.305 --> 22:41.503
- 'Cause she's probably on coumadin.
- Well, we never got a history; she can't speak.

22:41.535 --> 22:44.651
She's in A-fib.
ST segments are consistent with digoxin use.

22:44.705 --> 22:47.502
- She's probably on a blood thinner, too.
- Makes sense.

22:49.247 --> 22:51.592
I suppose vitamin K couldn't hurt.
Let's get her to trauma.

22:51.618 --> 22:53.731
Kaya, call the blood bank for FFP.

22:54.946 --> 22:56.573
Pretty smart for a med student.

22:56.606 --> 22:58.440
Book smart; she's got a ways to go.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.243
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait up, guys.
I was crutch training.

23:00.275 --> 23:01.691
We're moving to another room.

23:01.717 --> 23:03.443
You got to keep me in the loop here.
I got to know these things.

23:03.477 --> 23:07.081
It's an ancient Chinese proverb:
"He who saves a life is responsible for it."

23:11.868 --> 23:13.943
No cardiac activity.

23:18.557 --> 23:20.980
It's only been two hours.

23:26.427 --> 23:28.500
I need to ask you about something.

23:32.407 --> 23:36.592
See, in Greg's wallet,
he has an organ donor card.

23:37.627 --> 23:39.440
I want to make sure that's okay.

23:40.648 --> 23:42.422
He's not dead yet.

23:50.816 --> 23:52.890
If it comes to that,
then do what he wanted.

23:53.385 --> 23:55.551
Chaz, you been here a long time.
Why don't you take a break?

23:55.608 --> 23:57.013
I'm fine.

24:07.457 --> 24:10.451
Hi, Betina.
It's Sam again, from the E.R.

24:10.696 --> 24:12.371
Call us when you get this.

26:28.736 --> 26:30.240
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

26:32.127 --> 26:33.553
Crit's down to 24.

26:33.605 --> 26:36.073
- Did you recheck her protime?
- Protime's good, surgery's coming.

26:36.105 --> 26:38.951
- Only 80/40.
- She might not make it to angio.

26:39.007 --> 26:40.862
We couldryry prpreritoneal packing.

26:41.078 --> 26:42.132
Excuse me?

26:42.246 --> 26:44.590
Suprapubic incision,
leave the peritoneum intact.

26:44.618 --> 26:46.373
Pack three lap pads
on either side of the bladder.

26:46.406 --> 26:48.662
- We had good success in Nicaragua.
- In Nicaragua?

26:48.705 --> 26:51.471
I volunteer summers in a rural hospital.
High trauma, low tech.

26:51.696 --> 26:53.542
I thought ortho was admitting.

26:53.825 --> 26:56.872
Uh, unstable pelvis.
You ever hear of preperitoneal packing?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.973
They do it in Europe; it works.

26:59.705 --> 27:00.851
Shall I?

27:02.458 --> 27:04.412
Ten centimeter incision.

27:09.558 --> 27:12.040
- Just like a C-section.
- You've dee those, too?

27:15.287 --> 27:17.441
- Where are we with Greg?
- It's been...

27:17.518 --> 27:19.832
four hours; the neurologist is back.

27:19.917 --> 27:22.450
Good. All the way down
to the presacral space.

27:27.247 --> 27:30.291
- Uh, can someone help Norman, please?
- Pressure's up. Angio can take her.

27:30.316 --> 27:33.300
- Okay, that sounds like a plan.
- She doesn't need the O.R.

27:33.338 --> 27:35.980
You're lucky you have such
an experienced med student.

27:36.638 --> 27:37.390
Okay.

27:38.165 --> 27:39.651
Let's go.

27:50.487 --> 27:52.642
EEG remained isoelectric.

27:52.935 --> 27:56.822
- No brainstem evoked responses.
- Blood gas after ten minutes.

27:57.368 --> 27:59.792
PC O-2 is 74.

28:00.795 --> 28:02.372
Seventy four?

28:03.466 --> 28:06.113
Anything over 60 means brain death.

28:07.856 --> 28:09.922
I'm so sorry, Chaz.

28:19.597 --> 28:20.990
What are you doing?!

28:22.298 --> 28:25.302
Chaz, there-there are
no vital signs to monitor.

28:26.345 --> 28:28.050
N-Not yet.

28:28.927 --> 28:32.672
Can you please just keep
this thing going a couple more hours?

28:32.866 --> 28:34.713
No, no, he-he could come back.

28:34.956 --> 28:36.811
Maybe he'll come back!

28:37.147 --> 28:40.370
His heart's gone, his brain's gone.

28:42.548 --> 28:44.330
We're pronouncing him.

29:01.408 --> 29:02.980
He's still warm.

29:04.137 --> 29:06.383
Yeah, that's just the bypass machine.

29:07.005 --> 29:10.140
We need to keep him on it
to perfuse the organs.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.360
Neela's going to take him
to the O.R. now.

29:34.238 --> 29:36.041
I want to stay with him.

29:38.268 --> 29:39.873
I want to push his gurney.

29:40.855 --> 29:42.160
Of course.

29:52.866 --> 29:54.831
He's going upstairs.

31:41.795 --> 31:44.512
DVT's admitted
and biliary colic goes home

31:44.555 --> 31:46.223
with instructions
to lay off the cheeseburgers.

31:46.275 --> 31:47.820
Great. Thanks.

31:49.288 --> 31:52.723
It's, uh, pretty quiet in here, guys.
You can take another hour.

31:52.966 --> 31:54.562
And do what?

31:55.816 --> 31:59.520
I, um, I wanted to be there, but I thought
it was more important to cover for Morris.

31:59.576 --> 32:01.980
- It was a really beautiful service.
- Yeah.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.531
A bunch of stuff came. It's...

32:04.737 --> 32:08.702
a gift basket from a Dr. Weaver
in Florida. And-And this, it's, uh,

32:08.968 --> 32:11.703
comes all the way from Africa.
John Carter.

32:12.317 --> 32:13.430
Yeah.

32:13.836 --> 32:17.362
It means a person's soul will live forever.
We're supposed to leave it by the grave.

32:18.457 --> 32:21.283
Why don't you get caught up with
your patients, and we'll jump in.

32:21.666 --> 32:23.430
I need to change.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.143
Hey, guys.

32:25.227 --> 32:28.591
I was gonna drop Betina off at home,
but she wanted to stop by.

32:29.246 --> 32:33.340
Since I didn't get to speak to you
all at the church, you were...

32:34.127 --> 32:36.552
you were a family to Greg.

32:37.067 --> 32:39.290
He loved you all very much.

32:39.317 --> 32:40.963
You should know that.

32:42.768 --> 32:44.912
- We got a sick one here.
- We're on it.

32:45.327 --> 32:47.753
Fever, low BP,
altered and a broken leg.

32:47.808 --> 32:49.982
I remember that guy;
he'll talk your ear off.

32:50.016 --> 32:51.362
Not today.

32:51.586 --> 32:54.860
Two liters of saline,
set up for intubation.

32:56.007 --> 32:57.173
Hey, Abby.

32:58.636 --> 33:00.382
It was nice to see Luka at the funeral.

33:00.806 --> 33:03.551
- Is he coming to Ike's?
- No, he had a plane to catch.

33:03.786 --> 33:06.572
- It's good to see you together.
- Amen to that.

33:06.608 --> 33:09.860
- Neela, they need you in Trauma.
- Do I have time to get into my scrubs?

33:10.085 --> 33:11.422
Of course not.

33:12.205 --> 33:15.030
Luka said something about
an interview in Boston.

33:15.106 --> 33:16.002
Yeah.

33:16.225 --> 33:17.731
We were thinking about moving.

33:17.798 --> 33:20.043
But now I'm not so sure.

33:21.045 --> 33:23.133
It's hard to imagine
leaving this place.

33:25.836 --> 33:27.031
What do you need?

33:27.078 --> 33:29.731
Fever and sepsis.
We're looking for the source.

33:31.896 --> 33:32.991
Bingo.

33:33.048 --> 33:34.972
Feels fluctuant.

33:37.405 --> 33:38.673
Would you like the honors?

33:38.706 --> 33:40.552
Please don't make me put on gloves.

33:40.577 --> 33:42.111
18 gauge.

33:51.025 --> 33:52.460
Full of puss.

33:52.576 --> 33:55.692
- Okay, he needs a wash-out in the O.R.
- That sounds about right.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.930
Excuse me.
Hello.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.363
Yeah, no worries, I can talk.

34:08.056 --> 34:09.690
Are you feeling better?

34:10.895 --> 34:12.991
I just needed a minute.

34:14.606 --> 34:17.333
I meant, better from the surgery.

34:17.887 --> 34:21.391
Oh, yeah.
I'm, uh, I'm going back
to work on Monday.

34:21.647 --> 34:22.973
Oh, that's good.

34:24.328 --> 34:26.873
I mean, I mean, that,
you know, you're ready.

34:29.226 --> 34:32.201
But, you-- it's also good that
you have a little more time off,

34:32.317 --> 34:34.313
as well, you know.

34:35.717 --> 34:37.183
Oh, man.

34:38.297 --> 34:39.321
What?

34:47.264 --> 34:49.141
I'm not sure how to do this.

34:50.427 --> 34:51.833
Do what?

34:58.255 --> 35:00.393
I've been holding onto something.

35:01.326 --> 35:03.682
And I didn't know the right time.

35:04.897 --> 35:08.910
And now I know that there's never
going to be a right time, so...

35:32.795 --> 35:34.322
This is for you.

35:35.946 --> 35:38.632
It was in Greg's pocket
on the day he died.

36:03.525 --> 36:06.501
You know, that guy got hurt
last week trying to be a hero.

36:06.525 --> 36:07.581
Yeah.

36:10.105 --> 36:12.703
I've been thinking
a lot about last week and

36:12.736 --> 36:16.132
about how Pratt wouldn't
let me get on that ambulance.

36:17.747 --> 36:19.842
So I don't want to waste time.

36:22.457 --> 36:26.753
I just want you to know I wouldn't be with you
if I didn't think that we could have something real.

36:27.785 --> 36:29.451
I feel the same.

36:30.707 --> 36:33.092
Sam, Gates, you know about Ike's?

36:33.118 --> 36:37.781
- Yeah.
- We'll try to start around 8:30.

36:38.136 --> 36:40.912
If anyone has anything
they want to say, you know.

36:40.936 --> 36:42.961
Share a story or a memory.

36:43.038 --> 36:44.410
That would be the time.

36:44.438 --> 36:47.140
Can you hang up or take
that someplace else?

36:47.875 --> 36:49.711
Sorry, that was Anspaugh.

36:50.096 --> 36:51.610
Uncle Donnie?

36:55.397 --> 36:59.091
He thought that everyone should know
that they were going to offer Greg the job.

36:59.295 --> 37:01.791
He was going to be the Chief of the E.R.

37:13.006 --> 37:14.353
Excuse me.

37:17.136 --> 37:18.513
Chaz, wait up.

37:19.136 --> 37:20.910
Hey, we're all going to Ike's tonight.

37:21.547 --> 37:22.851
I don't think so.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.562
Everybody's going to be there.

37:25.206 --> 37:27.940
- I already went to the funeral.
- This is different.

37:28.807 --> 37:30.653
Been doing it all day.

37:30.886 --> 37:33.273
Shaking hands, getting hugs.

37:33.906 --> 37:37.363
They say, "Are you okay?"
and I smile and I nod.

37:37.998 --> 37:39.882
I can't do it anymore.

37:41.356 --> 37:44.432
I've lost a lot of people in my life,
but not like this,

37:44.488 --> 37:45.722
not a brother.

37:45.955 --> 37:49.823
But I think you're gonna miss out
on something if you don't go.

37:50.587 --> 37:53.980
- Tonight's about remembering him.
- You all get to do that.

37:54.605 --> 37:58.111
He worked here for eight years.
I only knew him for a couple.

37:58.338 --> 38:01.093
I was trying to catch up
on the 18 that I missed out on.

38:01.838 --> 38:03.693
I was just starting to know him.

38:04.495 --> 38:05.933
I'm sorry.

38:07.297 --> 38:09.223
Have a good time at your party.

38:18.276 --> 38:20.942
I looked on a medical Web site,
and they said it was probably a virus.

38:21.007 --> 38:23.132
I didn't even think about
what was going on underneath my cast.

38:23.165 --> 38:25.840
Not a good idea to scratch
your skin with a wire coat hanger.

38:26.157 --> 38:29.001
The itching was driving me nuts.

38:29.037 --> 38:32.373
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is this an unusual case?

38:32.418 --> 38:34.500
Do you think you could, like,
write this up for the journals?

38:34.536 --> 38:37.570
Noan, I think you need to rest.
And so do I.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.160
Hello, there.
Someone wanted to see you.

38:40.208 --> 38:42.612
Oh, my God!
I didn't know you made it!

38:42.637 --> 38:45.603
They wouldn't give me information on the phone,
and I couldn't see you 'cae I'm not a relative.

38:45.617 --> 38:49.251
- Norman, easy.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

38:49.277 --> 38:52.700
Thank you.
Thank you for saving me.

38:52.748 --> 38:56.683
- You look fantastic.
- We'll, uh, let the two of you, uh, catch up.

39:01.725 --> 39:03.763
So, are you going to Ike's?

39:06.166 --> 39:08.210
- Should I wait for you?
- No.

39:18.577 --> 39:20.400
He's taking a leak,

39:20.488 --> 39:23.833
and he finds Morris hiding in a stall,

39:23.907 --> 39:26.812
on his cell phone,
getting advice about a case.

39:26.838 --> 39:29.550
He storms back to the desk
and tells me,

39:29.627 --> 39:32.820
"That kid couldn't find
his ass with both hands."

39:33.436 --> 39:37.033
- And Pratt was always right.
- Yeah, very funny, very funny.

39:37.135 --> 39:39.041
Okay, excuse me, everybody.

39:40.727 --> 39:43.740
Tonight's not about
speeches or anything, but...

39:43.956 --> 39:46.760
I was going to say something,
and I was wondering if anybody else...

39:47.877 --> 39:49.493
Hold on.
Sorry.

39:50.198 --> 39:52.610
This is from the church.
I thought it should be here.

40:05.108 --> 40:07.120
Who, uh, who wants to start?

40:18.838 --> 40:23.221
A... couple of years ago,
after Michael died,

40:25.297 --> 40:28.551
Greg helped me through
the hardest time of my life, and...

40:28.608 --> 40:31.061
I don't think I ever
thanked him enough for that.

40:32.915 --> 40:34.003
Chaz.

40:43.358 --> 40:47.161
Before I met Greg, I was,
uh, pretty clueless.

40:51.335 --> 40:53.571
He taught me that anything is possible.

40:55.155 --> 40:56.973
And he taught me not to be scared.

40:57.477 --> 40:59.671
It helped me to realize who I was.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.470
And the kind of person I wanted to be.

41:08.557 --> 41:10.703
I got this from UNOS.

41:10.905 --> 41:14.742
A 15-year-old girl in Nebraska,

41:15.066 --> 41:18.302
father of three in Maryland
and a college student in Texas

41:18.336 --> 41:21.151
all got organs from Greg.

41:23.625 --> 41:25.852
He saved three lives that day.

41:29.117 --> 41:32.252
You know, uh, sometimes,
after a really gnarly shift,

41:32.946 --> 41:36.271
Greg would drag me over here,
he'd buy me a beer,

41:36.757 --> 41:40.690
and we would, uh, we would share
an order of his all-time favorite:

41:40.717 --> 41:43.420
deep-fried mozzarella sticks.

41:43.476 --> 41:46.973
Yeah, he'd say that the clams might
be frozen, the mushrooms might be bad,

41:47.006 --> 41:49.702
but you can never
go wrong with mozzarella. So...

41:51.798 --> 41:53.793
I invite all of you

41:54.258 --> 41:56.421
to dip deep into the marinara

41:56.467 --> 41:58.830
 and, uh, raise your cheese...

41:59.886 --> 42:01.812
as we embrace the memory

42:02.695 --> 42:04.391
of our colleague,

42:05.058 --> 42:06.500
our mentor,

42:07.695 --> 42:09.063
our chief...

42:11.757 --> 42:13.652
...and our dear friend.

42:21.865 --> 42:23.632
God, we miss you.

42:25.978 --> 42:28.260
- To Greg.
- Dr. Pratt.

42:28.737 --> 42:30.123
Greg.
