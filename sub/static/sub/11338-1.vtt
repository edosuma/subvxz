<i>previously on criminal minds...</i>

00:01.267 --> 00:02.834
The boston reaper?
the reaper.

00:02.901 --> 00:05.400
If you stop hunting me,
i'll stop hunting them.

00:05.467 --> 00:08.567
I don't make deals.
i'm the guy who hunts
guys like you.

00:08.634 --> 00:09.901
You'll regret this.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.934
[gunfire, screaming]

00:16.367 --> 00:18.567
Wake up, derek.
it's time to die.

00:18.634 --> 00:19.834
George foyet is the reaper.

00:19.901 --> 00:21.834
Foyet escaped.
where's my badge?

00:21.901 --> 00:23.701
Guards found him
in his cell vomiting
blood and convulsing.

00:23.767 --> 00:25.033
They rushed him to
the prison hospital.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.567
They're gonna find him,
right?

00:26.634 --> 00:28.067
No, they're not.

00:28.133 --> 00:31.033
You should have made a deal.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.367
[gunshot]

00:33.434 --> 00:36.367
Dispatcher: all units
in the vicinity
of north harney boulevard,

00:36.434 --> 00:39.434
Shots fired at
751 north harney.

00:39.501 --> 00:42.267
Repeat, all units,
shots fired

00:42.334 --> 00:44.334
At 751 north harney.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.567
We're not working a case.

00:45.634 --> 00:47.067
Why call us
to a crime scene?

00:47.133 --> 00:49.667
I was hoping you knew.

00:49.734 --> 00:52.067
Jj said the police told her
it was urgent.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.968
4 hours of sleep after
what we went through
in canada, it better be.

00:55.033 --> 00:58.701
[sirens]

01:06.067 --> 01:08.000
Oh, you guys
are already here.

01:08.067 --> 01:10.067
You guys remember
detective walker?

01:10.133 --> 01:11.234
Thanks for being here.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.934
I understand none of you
are working on much rest.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.934
Who's the victim?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.334
His name is nelson martinez.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.534
From what we can figure,
he answered his door,

01:18.601 --> 01:19.968
Was forced into
the apartment at gunpoint

01:20.033 --> 01:22.467
And then shot in the chest.
it was all pretty sloppy.

01:22.534 --> 01:24.834
No disrespect,
but i don't understand
why you need us here.

01:24.901 --> 01:27.200
2 days ago, a local doctor
named tom barton

01:27.267 --> 01:29.267
Found a note addressed
to him at the hospital.

01:29.334 --> 01:31.868
It said the person was
planning to kill his son.

01:31.934 --> 01:33.868
If dr. barton tried
to keep his boy hidden,

01:33.934 --> 01:36.067
One person would die
every day in his place.

01:36.133 --> 01:37.467
And you think
this is connected?

01:37.534 --> 01:39.901
Reid:
the note is signed l.c.

01:39.968 --> 01:41.767
Walker:
yesterday we had another victim.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.934
Multiple gunshots
outside the apartment.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.868
The shooter wrote l.c.
in white chalk next to the body.

01:46.934 --> 01:50.167
Now, unless dr. barton
puts his son in harm's way,

01:50.234 --> 01:51.801
We're going to keep having
a victim a day.

01:51.868 --> 01:53.434
Where's barton now?

01:53.501 --> 01:55.067
He's at home. he doesn't
know about this victim yet.

01:55.133 --> 01:56.667
Where's hotch?

01:56.734 --> 01:58.601
He's not answering his cell.
i assume it's on vibrate.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.100
He'll get the message
when he wakes up.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.734
Try him again. he can
meet us at barton's house.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.968
[cell phone rings]

02:06.033 --> 02:07.434
[ring]

02:07.501 --> 02:09.967
Hotch: you've reached
supervisory special agent
aaron hotchner.

02:10.032 --> 02:12.000
Please leave a detailed
message. thank you.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.167
[beep]

02:13.234 --> 02:14.734
Hotch, jj again.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.501
Listen, we're gonna need you
to meet us at an address

02:17.567 --> 02:19.567
In mclean, virginia--
120 kensington road.

02:19.634 --> 02:21.467
Call me when you get this.

02:22.701 --> 02:26.033
Prentiss: dr. barton,
where is your son right now?

02:26.100 --> 02:28.367
Um, i asked him
to stay up in his room.

02:28.434 --> 02:30.200
Jj: and what did you tell him?

02:30.267 --> 02:31.701
[clears throat]

02:31.767 --> 02:34.434
I told him that there
was a threat against me
at the hospital.

02:34.501 --> 02:36.534
I told him the police
didn't take it seriously

02:36.601 --> 02:38.534
But that they wanted me
to stay here for a few days

02:38.601 --> 02:40.200
And that i wanted
to have him with me.

02:40.267 --> 02:41.534
And jeffrey's mother?

02:41.601 --> 02:43.534
She died when he was 10.

02:43.601 --> 02:45.200
Breast cancer.

02:45.267 --> 02:46.868
Would someone
really hurt jeffrey?

02:46.934 --> 02:48.567
2 people are dead already.

02:48.634 --> 02:51.667
Whoever sent that note
is obviously serious.

02:51.734 --> 02:54.467
And if i don't let
jeffrey out of the house,

02:54.534 --> 02:56.367
Then another person's gonna die?

02:56.434 --> 02:58.467
Right now we have to assume
that he will keep killing.

02:58.534 --> 02:59.868
My son is 15 years old.

02:59.934 --> 03:01.067
I understand.

03:01.133 --> 03:02.767
I cannot put him in danger.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.334
We are not asking you to.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.767
And even if
you were willing,

03:05.834 --> 03:07.334
We couldn't
send him to school

03:07.400 --> 03:09.067
Knowing he would
endanger every student
in the building.

03:09.133 --> 03:11.167
What we need to do now

03:11.234 --> 03:12.834
Is go over everything
we know,

03:12.901 --> 03:15.667
Piece together how this
person fits into your life.

03:15.734 --> 03:18.000
Well, i--i--
i can't think of anyone

03:18.067 --> 03:20.033
Who would want to kill jeffrey.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.667
Whoever wrote that note
was putting you on notice--

03:22.734 --> 03:23.901
This is personal.

03:23.968 --> 03:25.934
He wants you to remember
who he is,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.100
And until that happens,
he hasn't accomplished
what he set out to do.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.467
Morgan: i know you've
been asked this before,
but, please,

03:31.534 --> 03:34.801
Think again--
do you know anyone
with the initials l.c.

03:34.868 --> 03:37.200
[sighs] i've looked everywhere--

03:37.267 --> 03:39.467
Day planner, emails,

03:39.534 --> 03:41.367
Patient lists.
there's no one.

03:41.434 --> 03:43.868
Have you noticed anyone
who might have been
watching you,

03:43.934 --> 03:46.367
Either at the hospital
or here in the neighborhood?

03:46.434 --> 03:47.901
I...i'm sorry.

03:47.968 --> 03:51.367
Both the victims he's killed
have been hispanic men
in their 40s.

03:51.434 --> 03:53.567
Have you had a patient
recently that fits
the description?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.701
I'm a trauma surgeon in d.c.

03:55.767 --> 03:58.334
I have endless patients,
all demographics.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.968
We're gonna need records of
all your recent surgeries.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.434
Of course.

04:02.501 --> 04:03.701
I'll call garcia.

04:03.767 --> 04:05.767
I--i don't understand.

04:05.834 --> 04:07.767
If he's mad at me,
why not just kill me?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.634
Jj. is there any word
from hotch?

04:12.701 --> 04:13.767
No, nothing.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.801
Huh. that's not like him.

04:15.868 --> 04:17.834
Yeah, i know.

04:17.901 --> 04:18.733
[cell phone rings]

04:18.801 --> 04:20.166
It's mine.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.534
[ring]

04:21.601 --> 04:23.434
Dad?
hello?

04:23.501 --> 04:25.067
Jeffrey?

04:25.133 --> 04:26.300
Please don't be mad at me.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.834
What--what's happening?
are you ok?

04:30.133 --> 04:32.367
Jeffrey, what's going on?

04:35.367 --> 04:37.534
Talk to me.

04:38.334 --> 04:39.801
He's not up here.

04:39.868 --> 04:41.868
Jeffrey, where are you?

04:41.934 --> 04:43.133
I'm at school.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.968
I'm ok. please tell
the police that i'm ok.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.267
I love you.

"a weak man has doubts

05:36.517 --> 05:39.451
A strong man has them

05:39.517 --> 05:42.983
[overlapping chatter]

05:50.484 --> 05:52.417
Dr. barton, please.

05:52.484 --> 05:53.950
You need to go back inside.

05:54.017 --> 05:55.983
I'm coming with you.
i'm gonna get my son.

05:56.050 --> 05:57.084
Sir, right now nobody
is getting your son.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.850
Agent prentiss will explain it.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.751
I don't need an explanation.
i'm getting jeffrey.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.384
You need to listen right now.

06:02.451 --> 06:03.551
Once your son left this house,

06:03.617 --> 06:06.250
The safest place for him to be
is at that school.

06:06.317 --> 06:08.217
We can control access
in and out.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.517
Detective walker will
organize an evacuation

06:09.584 --> 06:10.818
As soon as the school day
is done.

06:10.883 --> 06:12.551
But if we incite a panic now

06:12.617 --> 06:15.284
And the unsub is outside,
a lot of kids are gonna die.

06:15.351 --> 06:16.784
What if the killer
is already at the school?

06:16.850 --> 06:18.484
Then we'll be there, too.

06:18.551 --> 06:20.351
Let us do our job.

06:20.417 --> 06:21.451
Jeffrey knows better
than this.

06:21.517 --> 06:23.718
He doesn't put himself
in danger.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.651
I think he's just trying
to do the right thing.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.184
He sees what his father does
for a living.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.517
This is his way of trying
to save lives, too.

06:30.551 --> 06:31.983
You'll be there?

06:32.050 --> 06:33.751
Yes.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.684
Tell him i'm not mad at him.

06:38.751 --> 06:40.950
Tell him i love him,
and, uh...

06:41.017 --> 06:42.250
I'm proud of him.

06:42.317 --> 06:44.217
We will.

06:46.351 --> 06:48.017
This guy's a trauma surgeon

06:48.084 --> 06:49.917
Working a major
metropolitan area.

06:49.983 --> 06:51.617
We are talking
thousands of surgeries.

06:51.684 --> 06:52.983
Confine it to
the last 6 months.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.250
That's still hundreds.

06:54.317 --> 06:55.317
I know.

06:55.384 --> 06:57.317
Ok, do you want
biographical information

06:57.384 --> 06:59.150
Or full medical charts?

06:59.217 --> 07:00.850
Can you get
the full medical charts?

07:00.917 --> 07:02.351
You know, for a smart boy,

07:02.417 --> 07:03.983
You still ask a lot of
dumb questions.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.351
You'll have them in seconds.

07:05.417 --> 07:07.150
Yes, my love.
hey, garcia.

07:07.217 --> 07:09.284
Has hotch checked in
with you?

07:09.351 --> 07:10.584
He's not with you?

07:10.651 --> 07:11.751
He's probably on his way.

07:11.818 --> 07:13.184
Uh, thanks
for everything. bye.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.850
She's going to email
the files. we'll print
them out from here.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.351
I could have my office
send over the files.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.384
No, no, trust us,
this is faster.

07:19.451 --> 07:20.517
We need to dig
through your life

07:20.584 --> 07:21.950
And try to figure out
why this is happening.

07:22.017 --> 07:23.850
Let's start with
the most recent cases first,

07:23.917 --> 07:27.050
Something set this
guy off, and odds are
it's in your files.

07:27.117 --> 07:28.217
[bell rings]

07:28.284 --> 07:29.784
I need to notify
all the parents.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.417
We think
that's a mistake.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.050
I'm in charge of
keeping these kids safe.

07:33.117 --> 07:35.551
Exactly. and there's
a natural end to this day,

07:35.617 --> 07:38.317
When buses and parents
come to pick these kids up.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.217
Whoever's doing this
is not an effectual shooter.

07:40.284 --> 07:41.784
His killings are sloppy.

07:41.850 --> 07:44.584
So if there's a panic,
a lot of people could be
caught in the crossfire.

07:44.651 --> 07:46.351
Can't you just
take jeffrey home?

07:46.417 --> 07:48.217
If we do that
and the unsub is watching,

07:48.284 --> 07:49.584
Someone else is gonna be killed.

07:49.651 --> 07:50.883
Then what?

07:50.950 --> 07:53.184
We lock up every filter point
except the front door.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.883
Nobody comes in.
we say it's school policy.

07:55.950 --> 07:58.983
No questions. and if someone
needs to see a student,

07:59.050 --> 08:00.417
We bring the kids to them.

08:00.484 --> 08:02.584
I'll need a complete list
and employment records

08:02.651 --> 08:05.983
Of everyone already
inside the building.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.084
I'll brief
your security guards

08:08.150 --> 08:09.850
And take care of
all of the exits.

08:09.917 --> 08:12.284
After that, i need you
to gather the faculty

08:12.351 --> 08:14.451
Into small groups
and bring them to me.

08:14.517 --> 08:16.684
Treat it as routine.

08:16.751 --> 08:17.883
And in the meantime,
i need you

08:17.950 --> 08:19.684
To get jeffrey out of class
as casually as possible.

08:19.751 --> 08:21.150
Can you do that?

08:30.917 --> 08:32.850
Jeffrey barton.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.551
Can i see you for a moment?

08:34.616 --> 08:37.049
[students murmuring]

08:43.150 --> 08:44.250
Hey, jeffrey.

08:44.317 --> 08:46.917
My name's derek morgan.
i'm with the fbi.

08:46.983 --> 08:48.551
I saw you in my living room.

08:48.617 --> 08:49.950
Listen, the first thing
i need to know

08:50.017 --> 08:52.517
Is if you've told anyone
about what's happening?

08:52.584 --> 08:54.017
No.

08:54.084 --> 08:55.751
[students talking indistinctly]

08:55.818 --> 08:58.217
Back to class.
no loitering.

09:00.617 --> 09:02.150
Jeffrey, you're sure?

09:02.217 --> 09:04.917
Because even just
one text message
could set this place off.

09:04.983 --> 09:05.917
I'm sure.

09:05.983 --> 09:07.084
All right, that's good.

09:07.150 --> 09:08.950
We're gonna keep you
safe, kid.

09:09.017 --> 09:11.517
But in order to do that,
you're gonna have to
stay calm.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.117
And you're also gonna
have to trust me.

09:13.184 --> 09:14.451
You understand?

09:14.517 --> 09:16.184
Every time you step
out of class,

09:16.250 --> 09:17.217
I will be right here.

09:17.284 --> 09:19.417
Now, it's gonna look
like i'm just another

09:19.484 --> 09:21.017
Adult in the hallway
with principal findlay,

09:21.084 --> 09:22.451
But i got your back.

09:22.517 --> 09:23.850
Is my dad ok?

09:23.917 --> 09:26.250
He knows you were
just trying to do
the right thing.

09:26.317 --> 09:27.950
He just wants to
get you home safe.

09:28.017 --> 09:30.184
Do you think somebody's
trying to kill me

09:30.250 --> 09:31.451
To get back at him?

09:31.517 --> 09:33.017
It is possible.

09:33.084 --> 09:34.617
Do you know why?

09:34.684 --> 09:37.917
That's what
we need to figure out.

09:37.983 --> 09:39.517
Let's concentrate
on the note.

09:39.584 --> 09:43.317
For starters,
we know that he's male.

09:43.384 --> 09:44.517
How can you be sure?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.384
Women tend to add adjectives

09:46.451 --> 09:48.050
And very specific details
to their notes.

09:48.117 --> 09:49.384
This has none of those.

09:49.451 --> 09:50.883
Males are also more direct.

09:50.950 --> 09:53.317
First sentence--"i plan
to kill your son."

09:53.384 --> 09:55.250
And their notes tend to be
more about themselves

09:55.317 --> 09:57.117
Than the person
they're writing to.

09:57.184 --> 09:59.050
"i watched you every day."

09:59.117 --> 10:01.384
"i will watch you
lose everything."

10:01.451 --> 10:03.050
We know he surveilled
you and your son,

10:03.117 --> 10:04.551
Which means he either
has enough money

10:04.617 --> 10:05.950
To be away from
a regular job

10:06.017 --> 10:07.684
Or he's currently
unemployed.

10:07.751 --> 10:09.351
He's most likely a father.

10:09.417 --> 10:10.818
He's clearly grieving.

10:10.883 --> 10:14.317
He's taken great measures
to make sure you feel his pain.

10:14.384 --> 10:16.217
Let's start with cases
involving teenagers killed,

10:16.284 --> 10:18.850
But also anyone with
a strong family presence.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.751
Just because your son
is 15,

10:20.818 --> 10:23.417
That doesn't necessarily
mean that his child
is the same age.

10:23.484 --> 10:26.351
Have you had a lot
of cases like this,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.250
Where someone taunts you
with what they're gonna do?

10:28.317 --> 10:30.451
A few.

10:30.517 --> 10:32.784
And how did they end?

10:35.250 --> 10:38.084
Please.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.084
Suicide by cop seems
to be an effective way

10:40.150 --> 10:41.417
For them to make
their point,

10:41.484 --> 10:45.351
While ending their
suffering all at once.

10:47.617 --> 10:49.617
Jeffrey is leaving school
in 5 hours.

10:49.684 --> 10:52.484
There's no way we can
get through all these
patients in this time.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.117
Well, now, we've narrowed
it down already.

10:54.184 --> 10:55.584
And we still have
100 left.

10:55.651 --> 10:57.417
I'm sorry, i don't mean
to be callous,

10:57.484 --> 10:59.551
But when you work
in the e.r., you don't
remember names.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.317
You operate
and you move on.

11:01.384 --> 11:03.784
He's right. there are
too many files here

11:03.850 --> 11:05.950
For us to profile in such
a short period of time.

11:06.017 --> 11:08.551
Um, i can get to hotch's

11:08.617 --> 11:10.317
And get back here
in half an hour.

11:10.384 --> 11:11.451
Who's that?

11:11.517 --> 11:12.484
He's our supervisor.

11:12.551 --> 11:13.850
We weren't supposed
to work today.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.517
We're having trouble
getting ahold of him.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.917
But we need more eyes.

11:17.983 --> 11:21.084
The note doesn't say that
he'll kill jeffrey today,

11:21.150 --> 11:24.184
It says, "if not today,
tomorrow or the next day."

11:24.250 --> 11:25.651
Let's say he gets home safe.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.983
How long will you all
be around to make sure he's ok?

11:28.050 --> 11:30.250
Let's just
get through today.

13:59.417 --> 14:00.751
Overtime shift.
penelope speaking.

14:00.818 --> 14:01.818
Garcia, it's emily.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.117
I need you to listen
really carefully.

14:03.184 --> 14:05.150
Something's happened
to hotch.

14:05.217 --> 14:06.217
What do you mean, something?

14:06.284 --> 14:07.517
I don't know.

14:07.584 --> 14:09.818
I'm in his place.
he's not here,
but there's blood.

14:09.883 --> 14:10.818
Oh, my god.

14:10.883 --> 14:11.917
I need you to send police

14:11.983 --> 14:13.484
And fbi techs here
right away.

14:13.551 --> 14:14.517
Everyone available.

14:14.584 --> 14:16.384
Uh, do we need an apb?

14:16.451 --> 14:19.250
Only on hotch.
i checked out front.
his car's still here.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.818
I don't know.
someone took him?

14:20.883 --> 14:22.551
There's blood, but i can't
be sure whose it is.

14:22.617 --> 14:23.818
Just get people here.

14:23.883 --> 14:24.983
Ok, i'm sending an army.

14:25.050 --> 14:26.451
Garcia, i'm gonna
have to tell reid

14:26.517 --> 14:27.983
Because he's expecting
me back,

14:28.050 --> 14:29.384
But you can't tell the others.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.784
They cannot be distracted.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.950
Ok. ok.

14:33.017 --> 14:36.384
[cell phone rings]

14:36.451 --> 14:37.751
Hey.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.417
What?

14:39.484 --> 14:42.050
What--what are you
talking about?

14:42.117 --> 14:44.584
What's going on?

14:44.651 --> 14:45.751
Is this about jeffrey?

14:45.818 --> 14:47.384
No, no, it's unrelated.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.917
We only have a few hours
left here.

14:48.983 --> 14:50.718
I'm really sorry,
i have to take
this phone call, ok?

14:50.784 --> 14:52.917
What could be more important
than my son right now?

14:52.983 --> 14:56.150
I assure you,
this will take one second.
please, i promise.

14:56.217 --> 14:57.250
Fine.

14:57.317 --> 14:58.784
There's a huge hole
in the wall.

14:58.850 --> 15:02.617
Probably a .44,
but there's no blood
or tissue spray around it.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.950
Any idea how he got out?

15:04.017 --> 15:06.184
If he was shot,
there are no drag marks.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.850
But a body could have
been wrapped in something.

15:07.917 --> 15:09.417
And bureau techs
are on the way?

15:09.484 --> 15:10.684
Any second.

15:10.751 --> 15:12.284
All right, um, write down
everything you see

15:12.351 --> 15:13.983
And we'll profile
from your notes
when you get back.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.417
How's dr. barton?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.584
It's a huge list of cases
to go through with him.

15:19.651 --> 15:23.184
Ok, don't worry about
here. i've got this.
just stay focused.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.551
All right. you, too.

15:28.117 --> 15:30.050
Uh, dr. barton?

15:30.117 --> 15:32.050
Sorry about that.

15:32.117 --> 15:34.883
Agent prentiss has been
called away on an emergency.

15:34.950 --> 15:36.150
You gotta be kidding me.

15:36.217 --> 15:37.718
I'm confident
that the two of us

15:37.784 --> 15:39.184
Can do this together
right now. all right?

15:39.250 --> 15:42.317
We know he's been
killing hispanic males
as surrogates.

15:42.384 --> 15:43.551
Did you separate
the case files?

15:43.617 --> 15:44.551
Yeah.

15:44.617 --> 15:45.883
All right, how many
of the surgeries

15:45.950 --> 15:47.217
Fit the criteria?

15:47.284 --> 15:48.551
Um, 82.

15:48.617 --> 15:50.050
All right.
now let me ask you this.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.217
On how many of those dates

15:51.284 --> 15:53.917
Did you operate
on somebody else as well?

15:53.983 --> 15:55.751
75.

15:55.818 --> 15:58.684
Did any of those patients
die on the table?

15:58.751 --> 16:01.818
10. um, no, wait. 11.

16:01.883 --> 16:03.217
11. that's where we start.

16:03.284 --> 16:04.784
This whole thing
is about choice.

16:04.850 --> 16:07.184
He's forcing you
to play god with your son

16:07.250 --> 16:08.517
Because the last time
you had a choice,

16:08.584 --> 16:10.451
Your decision
devastated him.

16:10.517 --> 16:12.317
I'm a doctor.
i save people.

16:12.384 --> 16:14.184
It doesn't matter to him.
all that matters to him

16:14.250 --> 16:15.451
Is that you had
an alternative

16:15.517 --> 16:16.684
And you didn't take it.

16:16.751 --> 16:18.017
Now, how many
of those surgeries

16:18.084 --> 16:19.317
Involve patients under 20?

16:19.384 --> 16:21.017
Uh...6.

16:21.084 --> 16:22.917
We get a lot of shootings,
mostly gang related.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.850
Has a gang member or family
member ever threatened you?

16:25.917 --> 16:27.784
No, uh, at first
when you lose someone

16:27.850 --> 16:29.850
It's mostly confusion
and devastation.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.451
The anger comes later.

16:31.517 --> 16:33.417
All right, we have 6 dates
where you operated

16:33.484 --> 16:36.250
On an hispanic male
on the same night
a patient under 20 died.

16:36.317 --> 16:38.351
What i'm gonna do
is i'm gonna read
the names and dates

16:38.417 --> 16:41.084
And you tell me anything
you can remember, ok?

16:41.150 --> 16:42.284
Ok.

16:42.351 --> 16:45.584
All right, let's start
with january 22nd.

16:45.651 --> 16:49.117
Tyler hayes,
multiple gunshot wounds.

16:51.551 --> 16:54.250
February 13th,
brian douglas,

16:54.317 --> 16:57.351
Hit-and-run victim,
lacerated aorta.

17:03.917 --> 17:05.017
No.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.483
March 15th,
devon marks,

17:07.550 --> 17:08.517
Heroin overdose.

17:08.584 --> 17:10.017
Angela harris,
another car accident,

17:10.084 --> 17:13.416
Single vehicle,
bleeding into her brain.

17:18.684 --> 17:20.184
I...this is no use.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.084
I would remember
if i was threatened.

17:22.150 --> 17:24.317
Did any of them ask you
about your family?

17:26.483 --> 17:28.084
We have time.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.850
[clock ticking]

17:29.917 --> 17:31.584
Ok.

17:35.584 --> 17:37.317
I talked
to detective walker.

17:37.384 --> 17:39.950
Final bell's at 3:10.
he's gonna have
a s.w.a.t. unit

17:40.017 --> 17:42.384
In place at exactly 3:00
to escort kids out.

17:42.451 --> 17:45.217
We'll need you to gather
the students at 2:45.

17:45.284 --> 17:46.551
This could all
be happening now.

17:46.617 --> 17:48.617
If the unsub sees us
evacuate early,

17:48.684 --> 17:51.184
We feel certain
he'll kill another
random citizen.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.950
And this also buys us a day
to try and discover
his identity.

17:54.017 --> 17:55.551
So we'll have school buses
for evacuation.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.551
Teachers can brief parents
who are here to pick up
their kids.

17:58.617 --> 18:01.517
The key is to keep jeffrey
isolated and avoid panic
with the other students.

18:01.584 --> 18:04.317
If we can do that,
everybody gets out
of here safe.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.917
Have you cross-checked
all the records of
employees in the building

18:06.983 --> 18:08.584
Against dr. barton?

18:08.651 --> 18:09.983
Garcia's on it.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.317
Emily.

No. sorry, baby girl,
just little old me.

18:13.883 --> 18:15.217
You're out of luck.

18:15.284 --> 18:16.850
Right. sorry.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.718
Did you finish
the background check
on everyone in the building?

18:19.784 --> 18:22.718
Yeah. uh, no red flags,
no felonies,
no connection to barton.

18:22.784 --> 18:25.384
Ok, well, that's good.

18:26.784 --> 18:28.983
All right, listen, i gotta go.
there's about to be a bell.

18:29.050 --> 18:30.684
All right. be safe.

18:30.751 --> 18:32.818
Hey. everything ok?

18:32.883 --> 18:34.184
Yeah. oh, yeah,
i'm just tired.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.584
Yeah, i hear you.

18:35.651 --> 18:37.651
Let's just get this kid
home safe and we can all sleep.

18:37.718 --> 18:39.551
Right.

19:02.718 --> 19:05.017
I'm supposed to meet
with principal findlay.

her office is?

Hi. my name's
penelope garcia.
i'm from the fbi.

19:18.284 --> 19:19.950
I was calling to see
if an agent aaron hotchner

19:20.017 --> 19:22.017
Had been admitted
to the emergency room?

19:22.084 --> 19:23.684
Supervisory special agent
aaron hotchner.

19:23.751 --> 19:25.250
Hotchner, aaron.

19:25.317 --> 19:28.117
I wanted to see if he
had been admitted or if...

19:28.184 --> 19:30.551
Yeah, he's an fbi agent.

19:30.617 --> 19:32.684
What...

19:32.751 --> 19:34.551
When was that?

19:36.117 --> 19:38.517
Ok. thank you.

19:38.584 --> 19:40.317
Oh, my god.

19:41.217 --> 19:43.751
[cell phone rings]

19:43.818 --> 19:45.184
Talk to me, garcia.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.250
Ok, i--i called hospitals
to see if hotch

19:47.317 --> 19:49.484
Had gotten himself admitted
to an emergency room.

19:49.551 --> 19:50.617
And?

19:50.684 --> 19:51.883
He's not listed as a patient,

19:51.950 --> 19:53.617
But someone dropped
a john doe off

19:53.684 --> 19:55.184
At st. sebastian hospital,

19:55.250 --> 19:57.818
And that someone's name
was fbi agent derek morgan.

19:57.883 --> 19:59.917
It doesn't make sense.

19:59.983 --> 20:02.818
I know. do you think
they got their
credentials mixed up?

20:04.117 --> 20:05.484
The reaper.

20:06.617 --> 20:08.983
Foyet took morgan's creds.

20:09.050 --> 20:10.684
Why would he drop him off
at the e.r.?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.684
What hospital did you say
again?

20:12.751 --> 20:13.917
St. sebastian hospital.

20:13.983 --> 20:15.784
I'll call you with an update
when i get there.

20:15.850 --> 20:17.351
Yeah.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.718
I don't understand.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.651
These surgeries
are all hours apart.

20:20.718 --> 20:22.651
I didn't have to choose
between patients.

20:22.718 --> 20:26.050
If he's punishing me
for my choices,
none of these fit.

20:26.117 --> 20:27.417
All right,
look at the note again

20:27.484 --> 20:29.584
And compare against
the wording on the charts.

20:29.651 --> 20:31.950
A lot of times an unsub
will unconsciously mirror

20:32.017 --> 20:34.117
The wording of situations.

20:55.184 --> 20:56.584
You remember something?

20:56.651 --> 20:59.983
Uh, i don't know.
it was right after new year's.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.651
There was a car accident.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.484
One of the victims
was hispanic.

21:03.551 --> 21:05.917
New year's...

21:05.983 --> 21:07.651
Um...

21:07.718 --> 21:09.351
January 3rd,
there's a 2-car collision,

21:09.417 --> 21:11.484
You operated on
a hector ledezma.

21:11.551 --> 21:13.584
That was your only
surgery that night.

21:13.651 --> 21:15.150
Mrs. ledezma?

21:15.217 --> 21:16.551
The collision
lacerated his kidney.

21:16.617 --> 21:18.217
He lost a lot of blood.

21:18.284 --> 21:20.584
But we were able
to repair the damage.

21:20.651 --> 21:23.417
So, it'll take some time,
but he'll be just fine.

21:23.484 --> 21:25.351
What about my son?

21:25.417 --> 21:26.451
I'm sorry?

21:26.517 --> 21:28.384
Jason meyers. he's 18.

21:28.451 --> 21:30.284
He was in the accident.

21:34.317 --> 21:36.217
Your son was dead
when he arrived here.

21:37.818 --> 21:41.818
That's because i didn't
operate on the boy.

21:44.417 --> 21:45.818
They told me he's breathing.

21:45.883 --> 21:47.351
He's been put
on life support.

21:47.417 --> 21:51.684
But, um...
i'm afraid he no longer
has brain function.

21:51.751 --> 21:52.818
I'm very sorry.

21:52.883 --> 21:54.950
You're not even
gonna operate.

21:55.017 --> 21:56.284
It's too late.

21:56.351 --> 21:57.517
You don't even know
who he was.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.384
She had to give you
the chart.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.917
I'm sorry.

22:00.983 --> 22:03.417
Do you have children?

22:03.484 --> 22:04.451
A son.

22:04.517 --> 22:06.150
What would you say
to a doctor

22:06.217 --> 22:07.784
Who wouldn't even try
to save him?

22:07.850 --> 22:10.484
I'm sorry. i know
it's hard to understand,
believe me,

22:10.551 --> 22:13.117
But there is nothing
i can do.

22:21.017 --> 22:23.050
Garcia, i need you to find
a patient in the system

22:23.117 --> 22:24.718
Named jason meyers.

22:25.818 --> 22:28.117
He was admitted january 3rd,

22:28.184 --> 22:29.584
On life support.

22:29.651 --> 22:30.983
Oh, no.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.084
What?

22:32.150 --> 22:33.584
He was taken off the ventilator

22:33.651 --> 22:35.584
And declared legally dead
3 days ago.

22:35.651 --> 22:36.718
Who's his father?

22:36.784 --> 22:39.751
Yeah, uh, patrick meyers,
age 45.

22:39.818 --> 22:40.883
Get a photo into the school
immediately.

22:40.950 --> 22:42.250
I think he's our unsub.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.651
Ok. yeah.
it's on its way.

22:45.983 --> 22:48.584
He was stabbed 9 times,
but no major arteries were hit.

22:48.651 --> 22:50.917
It's a miracle
he's alive.

22:50.983 --> 22:52.584
When will he wake up?

22:52.651 --> 22:55.317
The anesthesia should wear off
within the hour.

22:55.384 --> 22:56.850
But he's bound to be
out of it.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.084
Ok.

22:59.751 --> 23:01.850
May i stay here?

23:01.917 --> 23:02.850
Of course.

23:02.917 --> 23:04.517
Thank you.

23:24.050 --> 23:27.684
[indistinct instructions]

23:31.417 --> 23:34.317
Don't worry. as soon as
the building's clear,

23:34.384 --> 23:37.217
You're gonna get
your own escort out of here.

23:47.818 --> 23:49.883
Come on, no pushing.
one at a time.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.084
Let's keep it moving.

23:57.150 --> 23:58.417
Nice and orderly.

23:58.484 --> 24:00.017
This abbreviation
right here, l.c.,

24:00.084 --> 24:02.551
What does that
stand for?

24:06.451 --> 24:08.184
[clears throat]

24:08.250 --> 24:09.351
Where are you going?

24:09.417 --> 24:11.017
The note says not to deviate
from my routine,

24:11.084 --> 24:13.017
And i always pick up
jeffrey on my days off.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.050
I'm gonna come with you.

24:15.117 --> 24:17.883
[cell phone rings]

24:17.950 --> 24:19.184
Yeah.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.718
L.c. on the unsub's note.

24:20.784 --> 24:22.517
It stands for "living children."

24:22.584 --> 24:23.584
Are you sure?

24:23.651 --> 24:25.317
It's administrative.
it's when they're afraid

24:25.384 --> 24:26.651
A patient's gonna go
on life support

24:26.718 --> 24:28.484
And they don't have
a dnr order.

24:29.584 --> 24:30.684
Reid?

24:30.751 --> 24:33.217
What if the unsub was
trying to tell dr. barton

24:33.284 --> 24:34.718
That he is actually
the target

24:34.784 --> 24:38.317
And that he's gonna
leave his son
without a father?

24:39.184 --> 24:40.117
[door opens]

24:43.684 --> 24:45.484

Uhh!

24:50.983 --> 24:52.417
Reid?

24:52.484 --> 24:54.017
Answer me.

24:54.084 --> 24:54.984
Reid?

24:58.084 --> 25:00.517
This is special agent
emily prentiss from the fbi.

25:00.584 --> 25:01.884
I need police
and an ambulance

25:01.891 --> 25:05.184
To 120 kensington road,
mclean, virginia.

25:05.250 --> 25:09.451
Shots fired,
federal agent possibly down.

25:09.517 --> 25:11.084
are you hit?
No.

25:11.150 --> 25:12.217
Get my gun. my gun.

25:12.284 --> 25:13.983
Get away from him!
get away from him.

25:14.050 --> 25:15.217
Whatever you do, stay down.

25:15.284 --> 25:16.751
Drop the gun!
don't protect him.

25:16.818 --> 25:19.084
He killed my son!

25:19.150 --> 25:20.983
He did not kill your son.
your son was killed
by a car accident.

25:21.050 --> 25:21.917
Stand up!

25:21.983 --> 25:23.117
I'm gonna ask you again,

25:23.184 --> 25:24.517
I do not want to shoot you,

25:24.584 --> 25:26.417
Please drop the gun.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.751
Stand up, you coward!

25:27.818 --> 25:30.017
Mr. meyers, listen to me.

25:30.084 --> 25:32.384
All right, it's over.

25:32.451 --> 25:35.250
Dr. barton
did not kill your son.

25:35.317 --> 25:39.184
Your son was killed
by a car.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.917
And this is not
what he would want.

25:40.983 --> 25:42.351
Ok?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.184
So drop the gun.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.584
Please.

25:45.651 --> 25:47.250
[sirens]

25:52.417 --> 25:54.351
Don't do it.

I'm sorry.

26:02.818 --> 26:06.584
I'm fine. go to him.
go to him.

26:06.651 --> 26:09.017
Kick his gun away. make sure
his gun's not near him.

26:09.084 --> 26:11.184
No...no, don't touch me.

26:11.250 --> 26:13.617
Oh, i want to die.

26:13.684 --> 26:15.517
Oh, don't touch me.

26:15.584 --> 26:18.184
I need to stop
the bleeding, ok?

26:18.250 --> 26:19.484
Let me die.

26:19.551 --> 26:21.284
The medics are almost here.
can you keep him stabilized?

26:21.351 --> 26:23.351
Yes, i think so.

26:23.417 --> 26:25.751
Hold on, hold on,
they're right here.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.250
Help is coming, all right?

26:27.317 --> 26:28.883
Hold on, hold on.

26:30.384 --> 26:32.751
We need a backboard
and a c-collar.

26:32.818 --> 26:35.017
Coming right up.

26:35.084 --> 26:37.784
Put pressure on this
right here.

26:37.850 --> 26:39.718
Call ahead to the e.r.,
tell them they got a gsw

26:39.784 --> 26:43.150
To the thoracic cavity
and have him redlined
to the o.r. stat.

Ohh...don't touch me.

26:52.084 --> 26:55.317
[sirens]

26:57.883 --> 27:00.084
Looks like it went
clean through.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.551
You might have
just saved his life.

27:01.617 --> 27:03.384
Keep pressure on this, ok?

27:03.451 --> 27:07.150
I'm good, i'm fine.
go to your son.
i'm good. i'm fine. go.

You ok?

27:10.317 --> 27:11.718
Reid: yeah, fine.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.917
We'll get you
to a hospital.

27:14.983 --> 27:17.351
You need to find emily.
call emily.

27:17.417 --> 27:18.684
Where is she?

27:18.751 --> 27:21.484
Something's happened to hotch.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.584
He still isn't
conscious yet.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.017
You sure it was foyet?

27:34.084 --> 27:35.684
He had morgan's
credentials.

27:35.751 --> 27:38.017
Did they catch him
on the security cam?

27:38.084 --> 27:39.150
You could see him
dropping hotch off,

27:39.217 --> 27:40.751
But the camera's
only on the entrance,

27:40.818 --> 27:43.517
So i have no idea
what direction he went
once he left the hospital.

27:43.584 --> 27:46.250
It doesn't make sense
for him to have brought
hotch to the e.r.

27:46.317 --> 27:49.050
Rossi: we know foyet gets off
on power and control.

27:49.117 --> 27:52.850
Maybe what he wants
is for hotch to know
his life was in his hands.

27:52.917 --> 27:54.617
He could do that
without risking
the hospital.

27:54.684 --> 27:56.117
Agents, he's waking up.

27:56.184 --> 27:59.217
Remember, he's weak.
don't push him.

28:10.317 --> 28:12.617
Where am i?

28:12.684 --> 28:14.217
In the hospital.

28:15.917 --> 28:18.284
How did i get here?

28:18.351 --> 28:20.584
Foyet drove you.

28:20.651 --> 28:22.917
Can you remember
what happened?

28:33.451 --> 28:36.150
You should have made
a deal.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.250
What did he take?

28:40.317 --> 28:41.983
What do you mean?

28:42.050 --> 28:43.751
The reaper always takes
something from his victims.

28:43.818 --> 28:45.351
Do we know what he took?

28:45.417 --> 28:47.850
There was a page missing
from your day planner

28:47.917 --> 28:51.050
In the address section,
the bs.

28:53.718 --> 28:55.484
What did he leave?

28:56.250 --> 28:58.117
I don't know.

28:58.184 --> 29:00.751
He also leaves something
with his victims.

29:00.818 --> 29:02.384
I looked over
your whole apartment.

29:02.451 --> 29:03.850
Nothing felt out of place.

29:03.917 --> 29:05.950
Where are my clothes?

29:30.584 --> 29:32.950
Haley's maiden name
is brooks.

29:33.017 --> 29:36.917
I always listed her
in the bs in my
personal information

29:36.983 --> 29:39.184
In case it fell into
the wrong hands.

29:41.384 --> 29:43.917
He knows where they live.

29:50.450 --> 29:51.751

to hotch's old address.

Oh, god, do you think
he's going after haley and jack?

29:58.817 --> 30:00.217
I don't know.
just send a s.w.a.t. team.

for instructions.
we're on our way.

30:02.350 --> 30:03.484
Consider them there.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.150
We need to be prepared
for what we might find.

30:05.217 --> 30:08.450
Foyet kept hotch alive.
he wouldn't do that
without a reason.

made a deal.

You can't show me fear?

30:36.217 --> 30:39.250
If you don't see fear,
maybe it's because
i'm not afraid of you.

you actually meant it.

about my behavior.

32:53.551 --> 32:54.951
What's going on?

32:55.018 --> 32:56.317
Is there anyone else
in the house?

32:56.384 --> 32:57.684
No, there's no one here.

32:57.751 --> 32:59.117
Haley, where's jack?

32:59.183 --> 33:01.751
He's at a friend's house
for a play date.

33:01.817 --> 33:03.484
We need to get him
back here.

33:03.551 --> 33:04.784
We'll explain everything.

33:04.851 --> 33:06.350
Where's aaron?

33:06.417 --> 33:07.884
He's in the hospital.

33:07.951 --> 33:09.083
What?

33:09.150 --> 33:10.384
Haley, please.

33:10.450 --> 33:12.884
Call for jack. tell them
i'm on the way to pick him up.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.784
I promise you we'll explain.

33:14.851 --> 33:16.317
Call for him right now.

33:16.384 --> 33:18.417
Text me the address.

33:18.484 --> 33:20.851
Tell me what happened
to aaron.

33:25.951 --> 33:27.217
They will kill you.

33:27.284 --> 33:28.384
Shh.

33:28.450 --> 33:29.884
Don't speak.

33:29.951 --> 33:32.717
You lost
a lot of blood.

33:32.784 --> 33:34.817
You'll need your oxygen.

33:34.884 --> 33:38.817
Do you know how much
you have to study
the human body

33:38.884 --> 33:42.250
To stab yourself
repeatedly and not die?

33:43.651 --> 33:48.450
I don't want to brag,
but i'm somewhat
of an expert.

33:48.517 --> 33:50.951
[groans]

33:54.951 --> 33:57.551
Do you want to see
my scars?

34:19.449 --> 34:21.183
What do you think?

34:21.250 --> 34:23.150
You like 'em?

34:23.217 --> 34:24.417
Huh?

34:24.484 --> 34:27.117
Yours are gonna look
just the same.

34:27.183 --> 34:28.317
My team...

34:28.384 --> 34:29.650
Your team.

34:29.717 --> 34:33.150
Your team didn't catch me
until i wanted them to.

34:33.217 --> 34:35.217
You're not in charge,
so don't be foolish.

34:35.284 --> 34:37.417
Now try to relax.

34:38.817 --> 34:42.350
Your body will go numb.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.183
[groans]

34:44.250 --> 34:47.018
And it goes in
so much easier...

34:47.083 --> 34:48.617
If you relax.

34:50.117 --> 34:52.384
The hard part

34:52.449 --> 34:55.083
Is not passing out
from the pain.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.284
Now, i understand
that profilers think

35:01.350 --> 35:04.417
That stabbing is a substitution
for the act of sex.

35:04.484 --> 35:06.417
That if somebody's impotent,

35:06.484 --> 35:10.717
They'll use a knife instead.

35:10.784 --> 35:13.083
Is that what you think,
agent hotchner?

35:13.150 --> 35:16.584
Maybe this will change
the way that you profile.

35:16.651 --> 35:19.717
[groans]

35:19.784 --> 35:22.717
[cell phone rings]

35:23.918 --> 35:25.551
They're safe.

35:28.450 --> 35:30.717
Is this really necessary?

35:30.784 --> 35:32.117
I'm afraid so.

35:32.183 --> 35:33.817
For how long?

35:33.884 --> 35:36.050
Rossi: i don't know.

35:36.117 --> 35:37.717
Mommy!

35:38.851 --> 35:42.517
They let me turn on
the siren!

35:42.584 --> 35:44.584
Wow, that's so great, baby!
did you have fun?

35:44.651 --> 35:46.584
Ohh...

35:46.651 --> 35:48.517
I'll help start a bag
in jack's room.

35:48.584 --> 35:49.551
Ok.

35:49.617 --> 35:51.918
How many times
did you run it?

35:51.984 --> 35:54.851
How many times? 3?

35:55.817 --> 35:58.284
You were at my place,
right?

35:58.350 --> 35:59.918
Could you tell
how he got in?

35:59.984 --> 36:02.317
I'm not sure.

36:03.484 --> 36:06.317
Do you want to talk
about what happened?

36:11.784 --> 36:13.417
I don't know.

36:13.484 --> 36:18.317
After he stabbed me
the first time,
it all goes blank.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.617
How do you feel?

36:27.684 --> 36:30.117
I'm gonna be ok.

36:30.183 --> 36:33.117
Did they explain to you
what's happening?

36:33.183 --> 36:35.584
They said the marshals service

36:35.651 --> 36:38.183
Is taking us straight from here

36:38.250 --> 36:40.617
And putting us into
protective custody.

36:40.684 --> 36:44.050
Haley, i'm sorry.

36:46.918 --> 36:49.150
Do you know where
they're gonna take us?

36:49.217 --> 36:50.484
No, i don't.

36:50.551 --> 36:52.384
And that's the point.

36:52.450 --> 36:54.951
I can't know
where you're going.

36:55.018 --> 36:56.651
If you have any contact
with anyone,

36:56.717 --> 36:57.984
Then he could track you.

36:58.050 --> 37:01.018
Jack has school.
he has friends.

37:01.083 --> 37:02.350
I have a job now.

37:02.417 --> 37:03.784
I know.

37:04.717 --> 37:06.250
And i'm sorry.

37:06.317 --> 37:08.417
We will catch him

37:08.484 --> 37:10.884
And you'll come back,

37:10.951 --> 37:13.384
And i promise
that i will spend
the rest of my life

37:13.450 --> 37:15.584
Making this up to you.

37:18.217 --> 37:22.183
Are you sure
that we're in danger?

37:23.284 --> 37:25.584
Yes.

37:28.617 --> 37:31.450
And what about you?
are you gonna be safe?

37:31.517 --> 37:34.384
He wants to see me suffer.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.317
Knowing that my son
is out there

37:36.384 --> 37:39.751
And that i can't see him
is better than killing me.

37:42.150 --> 37:44.018
What am i supposed to say
to jack?

37:44.083 --> 37:45.851
Tell him it's a vacation

37:45.918 --> 37:48.784
And that it's not gonna be
for very long.

37:56.250 --> 37:59.350
How am i supposed
to keep him safe

37:59.417 --> 38:02.384
If there is no one i know
to help me?

38:02.450 --> 38:04.083
Haley, you're strong.

38:04.150 --> 38:06.350
You lived with me
in this job,

38:06.417 --> 38:08.951
And you've practically
raised jack
all by yourself.

38:09.018 --> 38:10.517
You're a great mother.

38:20.984 --> 38:22.918
Can you catch this man?

38:22.984 --> 38:26.551
I will catch this man.

38:30.784 --> 38:32.884
Jack wants to come in.

38:35.350 --> 38:36.384
I want to see him, too.

38:36.450 --> 38:38.050
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

38:38.117 --> 38:41.384
Look, i know you're
trying to protect him.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.450
But you both need this.

38:44.517 --> 38:46.717
Please.

38:47.751 --> 38:50.050
Ok.

38:56.317 --> 38:58.951
[groans]

39:01.617 --> 39:03.250
Hey, buddy.

39:03.317 --> 39:05.918
Come on in.

39:05.984 --> 39:07.183
All right.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.817
Ohh!

39:10.918 --> 39:12.918
Don't worry. it's ok.

39:12.984 --> 39:18.350
The doctors made sure
that i'm completely fine.

39:18.417 --> 39:21.450
Did mommy tell you
that you two
are gonna take a trip?

39:21.517 --> 39:23.751
Yeah.

39:23.817 --> 39:25.751
So i'm not gonna
see you for a while.

39:25.817 --> 39:28.350
Why?

39:28.417 --> 39:31.417
Well, think about it
like when daddy
goes away for work.

39:31.484 --> 39:34.651
Only this time you and mommy
get to go someplace.

39:34.717 --> 39:38.050
But what do i tell you
every time i go away?

39:38.117 --> 39:39.551
You love me.

39:39.617 --> 39:42.350
More than anything
in the world.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.584
Are you ok?

39:50.417 --> 39:52.918
I'm very proud of you.

39:52.984 --> 39:54.817
Every single day.

40:03.751 --> 40:05.384
I'll see you soon, ok?

40:05.450 --> 40:07.217
Ok.

40:07.284 --> 40:09.384
You take care
of mom, ok?

40:09.450 --> 40:11.317
Ok.

40:18.018 --> 40:19.617
I know aaron's worried.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.617
Tell him i'll protect them
like they're my own.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.417
I just talked to spence.
he's gonna be fine.

40:34.484 --> 40:36.083
He's gonna have to be
on crutches for a while,

40:36.150 --> 40:39.117
But he said kicking down doors
is morgan's job, anyway.

40:41.117 --> 40:43.317
You know, foyet having
your credentials

40:43.384 --> 40:45.651
Had nothing to do
with any of this.

40:45.717 --> 40:47.584
It was just his way
of trying to torture you.

40:47.651 --> 40:49.684
Yeah, i know.

40:49.751 --> 40:51.517
Foyet's about
power and control.

40:51.584 --> 40:54.517
He was hoping to watch
me fall apart, and...

40:54.584 --> 40:56.684
Now he wants
to destroy hotch.

40:56.751 --> 40:57.817
Prentiss: exactly.

40:57.884 --> 40:59.350
That's his plan,

40:59.417 --> 41:01.317
And now we fight it.

41:33.551 --> 41:36.150
Did you hear what happened
this morning?

41:36.217 --> 41:38.450
No.

41:38.517 --> 41:41.918
We had a situation.

41:41.984 --> 41:43.951
Unsub had already
killed 2 people.

41:44.018 --> 41:45.951
Said he was gonna
keep killing

41:46.018 --> 41:49.951
Unless a man used his son
as bait.

41:51.450 --> 41:52.484
What happened?

41:52.551 --> 41:55.217
We kept the boy safe.

41:55.284 --> 41:56.717
Worked the profile.

41:56.784 --> 41:58.884
It was a happy ending.

42:01.417 --> 42:03.684
Do you know why
i'm telling you this?

42:03.751 --> 42:05.984
Yes.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.117
No other group
in the world

42:08.183 --> 42:10.250
Could have pulled off
what your team did

42:10.317 --> 42:11.450
In a matter of hours.

42:11.517 --> 42:15.217
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, dave.

42:15.284 --> 42:16.918
We'll get foyet.

42:16.984 --> 42:19.584
I promised haley
that we would get him,

42:19.651 --> 42:21.083
But the truth is,
if he stops killing,

42:21.150 --> 42:23.083
We have no way
of tracking him.

42:23.150 --> 42:25.617
He stopped killing
for 10 years
just for the pleasure

42:25.684 --> 42:29.018
Of watching shaunessy's
life fall apart.

42:36.018 --> 42:39.951
What's jack gonna remember
about me in 10 years?

42:40.018 --> 42:43.651
Hotch, look at me.

42:43.717 --> 42:47.018
I'm telling you,

42:47.083 --> 42:49.350
We'll get him.
