        Please pick up.         

00:16.750 --> 00:19.718

Norm, I know you're there.      

00:32.598 --> 00:35.467
    Pick up the phone, Norm.    

00:35.535 --> 00:37.736
It's 3:00 in the morning.       

00:37.804 --> 00:40.572
    I want you to come home.    

00:40.640 --> 00:41.940
             Norm?              

00:42.075 --> 00:43.876
             Norm!

            Hi, Sam.            
  This is Vera Peterson again.  

00:57.757 --> 01:01.026
    Listen, uh, ignore          
        those messages.         

01:01.094 --> 01:06.198
 It turns out Norm was here in  
 bed next to me the whole time. 

01:06.266 --> 01:11.437
         And I thought          
that big lump was our dog.      

01:11.504 --> 01:12.771
        Who knew?

02:26.179 --> 02:27.546
                      That's it.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.615
            The furnace is      
              definitely out.   

02:29.683 --> 02:31.650
 Any luck trying to get through 
    to the repairman?           

02:31.718 --> 02:32.985
No, it's still busy.            

02:33.053 --> 02:35.721
    Well, why don't you try     
     calling someone else?      

02:35.789 --> 02:36.989
What kind of manager are you    

02:37.057 --> 02:38.924
if you can't handle             
a simple problem like that?     

02:38.992 --> 02:40.959
 Sam, these are the only people 
        in Boston               

02:41.027 --> 02:43.829
who can service that Guatemalan 
  furnace you bought on sale.   

02:43.930 --> 02:45.431
Oh. Keep trying.                

02:48.068 --> 02:50.269
      It's ringing. Hello?      
        Hi, there.              

02:50.337 --> 02:52.104
      Uh, yes, our furnace      
        is on the blink.        

02:52.172 --> 02:56.275
Um, it's the Little Diablo      
      model, the grey one.      

02:57.877 --> 03:01.246
    It's a full duct,           
     forced-air model. Huh?     

03:01.314 --> 03:04.950
 Um, let's see... 55,000 BTUs.  

03:05.018 --> 03:08.220
             BTUs.              

03:08.288 --> 03:10.522
      Well, how do I know       
     what that stands for?      

03:10.590 --> 03:13.559
     You're the Guatemalan!     

03:13.626 --> 03:15.794
Carla, good news.               

03:15.862 --> 03:17.730
I've, uh, given                 
a lot of thought,               

03:17.797 --> 03:19.365
and I've decided                
to offer my employees           

03:19.432 --> 03:21.033
a, uh, group medical plan.      

03:21.101 --> 03:23.435
                Oh, man, that's 
                 great, Sammy,  

03:23.503 --> 03:24.603
Yeah.                           
         What changed your mind?

03:24.671 --> 03:25.971
Oh, it's the right thing to do. 

03:26.039 --> 03:28.040
You guys need it,               
you deserve it...               

03:28.108 --> 03:29.675
it's important to you.          

03:29.743 --> 03:32.111
Plus, they passed               
some kind of law.               

03:34.881 --> 03:36.815
All right, the thing is--       
      fellows, listen up.       

03:36.883 --> 03:38.584
              SAM:              
         To qualify for         

03:38.651 --> 03:41.320
the group rate, I need one more 
    person to sign on.          

03:41.388 --> 03:42.988
                        PAUL:   
                 Thank God, Sam.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.290
 You don't know what it's like  
to walk around uninsured,       

03:45.358 --> 03:48.027
knowing you might get hit       
 by a bus or need an operation, 

03:48.094 --> 03:50.529
and they'd take your house      
    and your, your savings,     

03:50.597 --> 03:51.964
         and that might         
      not even be enough.       

03:52.032 --> 03:53.632
    You saved my life, Sam.     

03:53.700 --> 03:56.869
 Actually, Paul, I was kind of  
thinking of offering it to Norm.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.873
Hey, congratulations, Norm.     

04:03.977 --> 04:06.779
Woody, why do I have            
to have this bag on my hand?    

04:06.846 --> 04:09.581
                    It's for the
                grand unveiling.

04:09.649 --> 04:10.749
                      Hi, Kelly.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.284
    Why do you have that bag    
         on your hand?          

04:12.352 --> 04:14.019
It's to cover up                
the beautiful engagement ring   

04:14.087 --> 04:15.421
that Woody just bought me.      

04:15.488 --> 04:19.992
        Oh, way to be           
    anticlimactic, Kelly!       

04:20.060 --> 04:22.261
                There, ta-dah.  

04:22.328 --> 04:25.364
      Wow, what a beauty!       

04:25.432 --> 04:28.467
So, uh, what's going on         
over here, you guys, huh?       

04:28.535 --> 04:31.737
  Yeah, we saw Kelly coming in  
    with a bag on her hand.     

04:31.805 --> 04:33.739
Yeah, it's for the              
grand unveiling of              
her engagement ring.            

04:33.807 --> 04:35.007
        Oh, damn.               

04:35.075 --> 04:37.509
We thought there was            
gonna be a puppet show.         

04:37.577 --> 04:40.312
    Well, I've got to           
    get going, Woody.           

04:40.380 --> 04:43.549
I'm meeting my lawyer about     
the prenuptial agreement. Bye.  

04:45.685 --> 04:47.953
    You, you guys have          
    a prenuptial agreement?     

04:48.054 --> 04:51.156
Sure. Oh, I love her,           
but I'm not stupid.             

04:52.859 --> 04:54.626
God forbid,                     
things don't work out.          

04:54.694 --> 04:56.862
I don't want                    
to lose half my stuff.          

04:58.498 --> 04:59.898
     Good thinking, Woody.      

04:59.966 --> 05:02.201
             NORM: So, uh, Wood,
             that's a nice ring.

05:02.268 --> 05:03.602
                Have her parents
                    seen it yet?

05:03.670 --> 05:05.237
No. They will                   
in a couple days.               

05:05.305 --> 05:06.939
They're gonna throw us          
an engagement party.            

05:07.040 --> 05:08.607
            A party!            
Oh, cool!                       

05:08.675 --> 05:11.377
 Her grandmother's even coming  
all the way from Florida.       

05:11.444 --> 05:12.711
     She's kind of the head     
         of the family.         

05:12.779 --> 05:14.413
From what I hear,               
she's pretty scary.             

05:14.481 --> 05:16.081
She's bossy, mean               
and tough as nails.             

05:16.149 --> 05:17.683
You wouldn't want               
to mess with her.               

05:17.784 --> 05:20.419
      Yeah? Bet you my ma       
        could take her.         

05:20.487 --> 05:23.422
Gloves or bare fists, open hand,
closed hand, I don't care.      

05:24.924 --> 05:27.426
Well, I've drawn up a list      
of names of the people          

05:27.494 --> 05:29.128
I want to invite                
to the party.                   

05:29.195 --> 05:31.797
The only problem is,            
I only get to invite a few.     

05:31.865 --> 05:33.532
Where do you                    
draw the line?                  

05:33.600 --> 05:35.668
  Well, Woody, something that   
Lilith and I find helpful       

05:35.735 --> 05:38.537
when we plan a party is to      
simply start at the bottom      

05:38.605 --> 05:40.806
of the list, and eliminate      
      the least desirable.      

05:40.907 --> 05:44.309
     Okay. Cranes are out.      

05:46.646 --> 05:47.746
    Thanks, Dr. Crane.          

05:47.814 --> 05:49.782
    That <i>was</i> helpful.           

05:54.621 --> 05:56.922
    So, uh, Woodso, how much did
         your ring set you back?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.058
  Well, they say when you buy   
      an engagement ring,       

05:59.125 --> 06:01.727
  you're supposed to spend the  
equivalent of six months salary,

06:01.795 --> 06:06.432
  but it looked kind of naked   
    without a diamond in it.    

06:06.499 --> 06:08.600
    So how much we talking?     
     Over a grand or what?      

06:08.668 --> 06:11.036
  Well, the salesman said that  
  it's bad luck for the couple  

06:11.104 --> 06:13.539
            to know how much    
             the ring cost.     

06:15.508 --> 06:19.611
Woody, how are you              
gonna afford that               
on your salary?                 

06:19.679 --> 06:21.547
    Don't worry, Sam.           
    I'm getting a night job.    

06:21.614 --> 06:24.249
You, you're gonna               
go do another job               

06:24.317 --> 06:26.685
after you leave here            
at 2:30 in the morning?         

06:26.753 --> 06:29.388
     Yep! Graveyard shift.      

06:29.456 --> 06:30.389
Where?                          

06:30.490 --> 06:33.192
        Graveyard, Sam.         

06:35.028 --> 06:37.763
                Gee whiz, say   
             good night, Gracie.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.867
      Maintenance sticker?      

06:41.935 --> 06:44.169
         I don't know.          
It's pretty dark in there.      

06:44.237 --> 06:45.704
             REBECCA: All right,
            hold on a second.   

06:51.845 --> 06:53.245
Carla, hand me the phone!       

06:55.749 --> 06:56.582
          Here you go.          

06:56.649 --> 06:57.649
                      Thank you.

06:57.717 --> 06:58.984
                      All right,
                  I'm wiping off

06:59.052 --> 07:00.819
                 the maintenance
                    sticker now.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.224
                        REBECCA:
    Well, according to this, the
     heater was last serviced...

07:05.291 --> 07:07.926
                 This heater has
            never been serviced.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.895
            I guess you don't   
              need to bring a...

07:09.963 --> 07:11.163
                     Carla, what
                  are you doing?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.331
                  Carla, what is
                     that noise?

07:12.399 --> 07:14.933
Well, I'm putting               
this grate back on.             

07:15.001 --> 07:16.568
You know, it's                  
a little dangerous              

07:16.636 --> 07:18.504
to have it lying                
around out here.                

07:18.571 --> 07:20.739
                          Carla!

07:20.807 --> 07:21.940
          Now this is not funny!

07:22.008 --> 07:24.810
        You let me out of       
            here right now!     

07:24.878 --> 07:27.379
        Oh, fine!               
I'm gonna call the police!      

07:27.447 --> 07:31.183
Boy, you know, one of our       
patrons could trip on this wire.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.054
                      Oh, great!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.723
                Now the phone   
            doesn't work either!

07:42.328 --> 07:43.962
 All right, it's closing time!  
          (rings bell)          

07:44.030 --> 07:46.732
  Everybody out. Mr. Peterson,  
 Mr. Clavin, come on. Let's go. 

07:46.800 --> 07:47.733
    I'm already late.           

07:47.801 --> 07:50.569
            Come on.            
I mean, the bar closes at 2:00. 

07:50.637 --> 07:52.571
     It's just now... 2:30.     

07:52.639 --> 07:55.541
Tonight's my first night        
at the graveyard.               

07:55.608 --> 07:57.309
I don't want to be late,        
all right?                      

07:57.377 --> 07:59.144
Now, come on, you guys          
really got to go.               

07:59.212 --> 08:00.312
Let's go.                       
Come on.                        

08:00.380 --> 08:01.580
      Woody! Woody! Woody!      
    Hold it! Hold it!           

08:01.648 --> 08:03.082
        What's the rush?        

08:03.149 --> 08:05.651
  It's not like your customers  
are going to be going anywhere. 

08:05.719 --> 08:08.620
                            Huh?
                     Yeah, yeah.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.291
But you know, it is going to be 
awfully lonely out there, Wood. 

08:12.359 --> 08:13.659
                          CLIFF:
                    Oh, no, now,
                    don't worry.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.160
                     You'll have
              plenty of company.

08:15.228 --> 08:20.132
  They won't be too talkative,  
what with their lips sewn shut. 

08:20.200 --> 08:22.901
 Well, you don't actually have  
to see the bodies, do you?      

08:22.969 --> 08:24.470
I mean, they're in the coffins, 
             right?             

08:24.571 --> 08:25.738
  Oh, yeah, most of them are.   

08:25.805 --> 08:27.039
  The ones that can afford it.  

08:28.842 --> 08:31.377
    Yeah, the rest of them,     
they, uh, put in body bags      

08:31.444 --> 08:34.113
  or sometimes just a big roll  
    of blotting paper.          

08:35.548 --> 08:36.782
            Sometimes they're   
            just laying about   

08:36.950 --> 08:39.451
     arms and legs akimbo.      

08:39.519 --> 08:43.155
     Yeah, their lips drawn     
      in a ghastly rictus.      

08:43.256 --> 08:46.492
I don't know what rictus means, 
          Mr. Clavin.           

08:46.593 --> 08:49.094
You will by sunup, my lad.      

08:49.162 --> 08:51.497
    Cut it out, guys.           

08:51.564 --> 08:53.699
      All right, come on.       
 We'd better toodle along now.  

08:53.767 --> 08:55.100
             All right, come on.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.736
  You know, I understand that,  
  Norm, the brain stays alive   

08:57.804 --> 09:00.172
        long after the body's   
              lying in a coffin.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.176
CLIFF:                          
Yeah, poor desperate soul       
in there trying to scream out,  

09:04.244 --> 09:06.512
"Don't bury me!                 
I'm not dead yet!"              

09:06.579 --> 09:07.946
NORM:                           
And all they can muster         

09:08.048 --> 09:10.482
                    is one final
                 frantic gurgle.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.784
Oh, the gurgle!                 

09:11.851 --> 09:13.519
                 Listen for that
                  gurgle, Woody.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.887
                  You listen for
                    that gurgle.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.190
     Hey, you guys are just     
trying to scare me, right?      

09:18.258 --> 09:19.892
        Forget it.              
    I got a job to do.          

09:19.959 --> 09:21.860
  I've got a ring to pay for.   
            Get out.            

09:21.928 --> 09:24.830
(gurgling voice):               
Good night!                     

09:24.898 --> 09:27.199
See ya!                         
Good night, Mr. Peterson,       
          Mr. Clavin.           

09:27.267 --> 09:30.202
(gurgling voice):               
Want to take a cab?             

09:32.472 --> 09:37.076
     Oh, man, buried alive.     
        Give me a break!        

09:37.143 --> 09:39.845
                         REBECCA
                 (echoey voice):
                          Woody!

09:39.913 --> 09:42.014
                Will someone let
                me out of here?!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.716
          (screaming)           

09:43.783 --> 09:46.585
Mr. Peterson! Mr. Clavin!       

09:57.530 --> 09:58.797
Excuse me, miss.                

09:58.865 --> 10:00.399
I've been sent                  
to collect some specimens.      

10:00.500 --> 10:03.202
 Oh, they're sitting over there 
 on the other side of the bar.  

10:05.472 --> 10:06.705
          No, I'm from          
     the insurance company.     

10:06.773 --> 10:08.841
  I need to do a blood sample   
    on each employee.           

10:08.908 --> 10:11.910
    Oh. Well, he works here.    
        Take him first.         

10:11.978 --> 10:13.078
MAN:                            
Fine.                           

10:14.247 --> 10:15.381
    Shall we go?                

10:15.448 --> 10:17.316
Yeah. What, uh, part            
of the body do you need         

10:17.384 --> 10:18.317
to take blood from?             

10:18.385 --> 10:19.585
                 Any part that's
                soft and fleshy.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.520
Well, have I got                
a treat for you!                

10:25.291 --> 10:27.693
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.      

10:30.597 --> 10:32.898
          Woody, man,           
    you look terrible!          

10:32.966 --> 10:35.401
        Yeah, I came straight   
             from the graveyard.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.970
              This is the       
            worst night yet.    

10:38.038 --> 10:39.204
                Why was that,   
                    there, Wood?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.173
     Well, a couple of guys     
        called in sick,         

10:41.241 --> 10:42.975
 and then, uh, we couldn't seem 

10:43.043 --> 10:46.111
 to bury old Mrs. Jane Van Der  
Hooven, beloved wife and mother.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.147
     It was like she didn't     
        want to go down.        

10:48.214 --> 10:51.550
        First the backhoe broke,

10:51.618 --> 10:53.786
    and we had to dig           
    the hole by hand.           

10:53.853 --> 10:55.654
      And then the ground       
        was frozen              

10:55.755 --> 10:58.390
    and, uh, broke the handle   
                  on the shovel.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.727
             And then the coffin
              kept popping open.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.028
             You...             

11:03.096 --> 11:05.330
    You never get used          
         to that, Sam.          

11:05.432 --> 11:09.001
I don't suppose                 
you do.                         

11:09.069 --> 11:10.669
                And then when   
            we finally buried   

11:10.737 --> 11:13.572
old Mrs. Jane Van Der Hooven,   
        beloved wife and mother,

11:13.640 --> 11:18.877
  there was, uh, this strange   
     gurgling sound and...      

11:18.945 --> 11:23.215
I knew it was probably just old 
Gus finishing his shake, but... 

11:23.283 --> 11:24.883
    uh, you don't want          
        to take chances         

11:24.951 --> 11:25.984
    on something like that.     

11:26.052 --> 11:28.554
         So, I had to dig her up

11:28.621 --> 11:30.289
                and check it.   

11:32.592 --> 11:34.426
                What a night.   

11:34.494 --> 11:36.061
I don't think you're            
gonna make it, man.             

11:36.129 --> 11:37.129
This job's gonna kill you.      

11:37.197 --> 11:38.430
WOODY:                          
Oh, Sam,                        
I gotta earn                    

11:38.631 --> 11:41.700
        enough money            
    to pay for the ring.        

11:41.768 --> 11:43.702
        (sobbing)               

11:47.107 --> 11:49.041

             every now and then.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.716
        Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.884
                     Who's next?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.553
             How about you?     

12:01.621 --> 12:03.422
              No, uh, actually  
              I don't work here.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.324
        I'm just one of the moms
             in the neighborhood

12:05.392 --> 12:06.658

12:17.303 --> 12:19.571
      Just for being late?

Come on, come on,               
you know the routine.           

12:58.978 --> 13:00.112
I-I-I did this earlier.         

13:00.180 --> 13:01.747
I give you blood,               
you give me money.              

13:01.848 --> 13:03.282
                You gave blood  
                already today?  

13:03.350 --> 13:04.683
WOODY:                          
I didn't give it--              
I sold it.                      

13:04.818 --> 13:06.919
Hey, I got a ring               
to pay for, damn you.           

13:06.986 --> 13:10.222
            FRASIER:            
     Woody, are you saying      
      that after four days      

13:10.290 --> 13:12.524
of virtually no sleep at all,   
you gave blood today twice?     

13:12.592 --> 13:13.726
        Is that bad?            

13:13.793 --> 13:16.128
Yes! The body can't take        
that kind of punishment.        

13:16.196 --> 13:18.597
You're suffering from a lack    
of blood and a lack of sleep.   

13:18.698 --> 13:21.367
My God, I'm surprised           
you're not hallucinating.       

13:21.434 --> 13:24.336
Huh. Don't worry about me,      
      Dr. Crane. I'm fine.      

13:24.404 --> 13:25.671
I just need a little sleep      

13:25.739 --> 13:27.840
    before that party           
        tomorrow night.         

13:27.907 --> 13:30.009
      Huh! Hallucinating.       

13:34.681 --> 13:37.349
     Woody. Why aren't you      
     dressed for the party?     

13:37.417 --> 13:39.351
              What party?       

13:39.419 --> 13:40.552
              Who are you?      

13:40.620 --> 13:42.554
            Why am I covered    
                 with ants?!    

13:45.458 --> 13:47.126
                Hey, Kelly.     
                What happened?  

13:47.227 --> 13:48.894
             I thought the party
             was tomorrow night.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.562
Oh, Woody, didn't you tell them?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.198
 I called you days ago and told 
you there was a change in plans.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.234
      Don't you remember?       

13:55.301 --> 13:57.236
Well, I remember                
you called me days ago,         

13:57.303 --> 13:59.805
and I remember you said         
there was a change in plans.    

13:59.873 --> 14:01.840
But I don't know what           
you're talking about.           

14:03.309 --> 14:05.077
But, okay, let's go.            

14:05.145 --> 14:06.912
        All right, pal.         
        Pal, pal.               

14:06.980 --> 14:09.248
  You're not in any condition   
      to go to this party.      

14:09.315 --> 14:10.482
I have to go, Sam.              

14:10.550 --> 14:11.750
I can't disappoint Kelly.       

14:11.818 --> 14:12.818
She's the woman I love.         

14:15.822 --> 14:17.756
Which one is she, Sam?          

14:27.901 --> 14:29.435
         Sit down here,         
             Woody.             

14:29.502 --> 14:31.070
Uh, why don't we catch up       
        with you?               

14:31.137 --> 14:33.072
It'll give Woody a chance       
     to change his clothes      

14:33.139 --> 14:34.406
and pull himself together.      

14:34.474 --> 14:35.741
                  Actually, Sam,

14:35.809 --> 14:37.409
                 that's probably
                    a good idea.
          Yeah.                 

14:37.477 --> 14:39.345
            Woody is acting kind
        of out of it tonight.   

14:39.412 --> 14:40.879
  I mean, he's fumbling around  

14:40.947 --> 14:43.349
like he doesn't know where he is
  or what he's talking about.   

14:43.416 --> 14:45.351
Have you two met?               

14:47.087 --> 14:49.021
                    I'll see you
                    soon, Woody.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.457
        Here you go, Woody.     

14:51.524 --> 14:52.791
          Whoa, whoa-hoa-hoa.   
                 Here.          

14:52.859 --> 14:53.892
                  Come on,      
             come on, come on.  

14:53.960 --> 14:55.761
        Pull yourself together. 
        Have some coffee.       

14:57.330 --> 14:58.931
Boy, it's true                  
what they say.                  

14:58.998 --> 15:01.433
Caffeine does                   
get you going.                  

15:01.501 --> 15:03.936
Uh, I figure I've got           
about a half hour               

15:04.004 --> 15:05.104
to make a good impression       

15:05.171 --> 15:07.039
before my skin                  
starts to blister.              

15:07.107 --> 15:08.741
                     You know...

15:11.277 --> 15:12.578
        Uh-uh-uh.               

15:12.645 --> 15:13.946
Keep your distance.             

15:14.047 --> 15:16.315
     I'm not afraid to use      
     this thing, you know.      

15:16.416 --> 15:17.383
                         Oh, for
                  heaven's sake.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.450
                 Look, allow me.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.718
             Perhaps I can be of
                some assistance.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.987
                Carla, Carla,   
                         please.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.156
         Now let's just...      

15:24.257 --> 15:25.824
              Look into my eyes.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.593
        Listen very carefully   
            to every word I say.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.596
         All he's going to do is
plunge this large-bore needle   

15:30.663 --> 15:32.364
                into your tissue

15:32.432 --> 15:33.999
        until it reaches a vein,

15:34.067 --> 15:35.734
              at which point the
        beating of your heart   

15:35.802 --> 15:38.404
        will cause your blood   
         to gush into this vial,

15:38.471 --> 15:41.740
                      filling it
                 with a viscous,
                  crimson syrup.

15:41.808 --> 15:42.908
(moaning gasp)                  

15:42.976 --> 15:44.009
(body thuds)                    

15:44.110 --> 15:46.445
         There you go.          
          Top her off.          

15:46.513 --> 15:48.447
Thank you.                      
                    My pleasure.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.187
                    SAM:        
                 How're you     
                doing, pal?     

15:55.255 --> 15:56.755
             WOODY:             
         Oh, fine, Sam.         

15:56.823 --> 15:58.023
That nap in the car             

15:58.091 --> 15:59.358
on the way over                 
really helped.                  

15:59.426 --> 16:01.126
I got my second wind.           

16:01.194 --> 16:02.394
            Woody...            

16:02.529 --> 16:03.829
    good to see you.            

16:03.897 --> 16:06.999
             WOODY:             
Oh. Good to see you, too,       
        Mr. Gaines, sir.        

16:07.067 --> 16:08.567
              Uh, how do you do,
          Mr. Gaines? I'm Sam...

16:08.635 --> 16:10.202
No, don't introduce             
yourself to me.                 

16:10.270 --> 16:11.637
             Oh, that's right.  
                 We've met.     

16:11.771 --> 16:14.340
No. I just don't                
care who you are.               

16:20.847 --> 16:22.081
Delicious.                      
                 Mmm. Mmm.      

16:22.148 --> 16:23.615
        Oh.                     

16:23.683 --> 16:25.951
             I see you gentlemen
                are enjoying the
                  smoked tongue.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.657
                  Ugh!          

16:31.725 --> 16:33.659
              Look at us, Cliff.

16:33.727 --> 16:35.327
                All the years   
                     of pretzels

16:35.395 --> 16:37.996
             and potato chips at
         the bar have ruined us.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.666
         Finally get a chance to
     broaden our horizons a bit,

16:40.734 --> 16:42.935
            educate our palate, 
                what do we do?  

16:43.003 --> 16:44.636
          We act like a couple  
              of bar goons      

16:44.704 --> 16:46.805
                at a rich       
                man's party.    
Hey, Norm.                      

16:46.873 --> 16:48.774
        (barking)               

16:50.744 --> 16:52.978
                Woody, I'm so   
            glad you're here.   

16:53.046 --> 16:55.147
            Grandmother can't   
            wait to meet you.   

16:55.215 --> 16:57.649
        And I can't wait        
to meet her, Kelly Gaines.      

16:57.717 --> 17:00.252
                Is he okay?     

17:00.320 --> 17:01.587
Yeah, he's fine.                
He's just, uh,                  

17:01.654 --> 17:03.355
been working                    
24 hours a day                  

17:03.423 --> 17:05.190
for the past four days.         

17:05.258 --> 17:06.791
                Is that a lot?  

17:06.859 --> 17:08.827
                I'm not part of 
                the work force. 

17:10.497 --> 17:12.964
KELLY:                          
Oh, look. There's               
grandmother now.                

17:14.934 --> 17:16.402
            Oh, my God, Sam.    

17:16.469 --> 17:17.703
                Save me.        
What? What?                     

17:17.771 --> 17:18.837
             It's Mrs. Jane Van 
                Der Hooven,     

17:18.905 --> 17:20.271
                beloved wife    
                and mother.     

17:20.339 --> 17:21.339
      Who?                      

17:21.441 --> 17:23.108
WOODY:                          
The dead woman                  

17:23.175 --> 17:24.076
                from last night.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.210
                I could never   
                forget her face.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.377
Oh, come on, Woody.             

17:26.445 --> 17:27.813
            I should know. I dug
             her up three times.

17:27.881 --> 17:28.847
Hey, Woody,                     
Woody, Woody.                   

17:28.915 --> 17:29.948
Stop it, man.                   

17:30.016 --> 17:31.083
You're hallucinating.           
                          No.   

17:31.151 --> 17:32.751
Remember what Frasier           
said about lack of sleep?       

17:32.819 --> 17:34.720
                That's her, Sam.
No. Woody,                      

17:34.788 --> 17:36.889
it is, it is                    
Kelly's grandmother.            

17:36.956 --> 17:38.924
          No. Check her head for
        a shovel-shaped dent.   

17:38.992 --> 17:41.226
    I'm not saying we did it,   
         but, okay, it was late,

17:41.294 --> 17:43.095
                    and we got a
                little careless.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.129
            Why are you         
            interrogating me?   

17:44.197 --> 17:45.898
          I'm not on trial here.
Shh.                            

17:45.965 --> 17:48.534
         You're Woody Boyd,     
            aren't you?         

17:48.601 --> 17:51.136
    See, Sam?                   
    She remembers me.           
Oh...                           

17:51.204 --> 17:54.206
        Kelly has told me       
        so much about you.      

17:54.274 --> 17:56.108
            So you're interested
             in getting married.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.044
        Perhaps you and I should
            have a little talk--

17:59.112 --> 18:00.446
            in private.         

18:00.513 --> 18:01.814
    That's a good idea.         

18:01.881 --> 18:03.449
    We should sit down          
    and do that sometime.       

18:03.550 --> 18:05.050
            Well, no time       
             like the present.  

18:05.118 --> 18:07.820
              Why don't you join
              me in the library?

18:07.887 --> 18:09.822
         Right in here.         

18:14.027 --> 18:16.295
                 Tell my parents
                    I love them.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.531
             NORM:              
    All right, buddy.           

18:19.599 --> 18:21.567
        I've got one.           
        I've got one.           

18:21.634 --> 18:23.869
            Little Orphan Annie.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.739
CLIFF:                          
Oh...                           

18:26.806 --> 18:28.807
that's a good one, Normie,      
but I didn't see it             

18:28.875 --> 18:30.809
'cause I've got cataracts.      

18:32.312 --> 18:34.480
                 Hey, hey, guys,
                    look at his.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.614
        (growling)              

18:35.682 --> 18:36.915
Oh, Sammy,                      

18:36.983 --> 18:38.050
                 come on. Tongue
                jokes were funny

18:38.118 --> 18:39.351
        like a half hour ago.   

18:40.987 --> 18:43.288
Don't just stand                
there, young man.               

18:43.356 --> 18:46.592
Come on and sit down beside me. 

18:54.901 --> 18:56.869
Are you cold?                   

18:56.970 --> 18:58.604
I'm freezing.                   

18:58.672 --> 19:01.106
 I seem to be cold all the time 
          these days.           

19:01.174 --> 19:02.708
         (wry chuckle)          

19:02.776 --> 19:04.677
Feel my hand.                   

19:08.715 --> 19:10.616
    If you don't mind,          
        I'd rather not.         

19:12.652 --> 19:15.554
Are you afraid of me,           
young man?                      

19:15.622 --> 19:17.456
                    What? Me?   
    Yeah.                       

19:17.524 --> 19:18.791
                    Scared? You?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.626
                        (laughs)
                          Never!

19:20.694 --> 19:22.461
                What crazy talk.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.796
    Oh!                         

19:25.699 --> 19:27.633
      Well, I can't think       
         of any reason          

19:27.701 --> 19:31.136
why a fine, young, strong,      
  healthy, young man like you   

19:31.204 --> 19:34.640
        should be afraid        
of a helpless, old lady like me,

19:34.708 --> 19:38.010
 unless it's because you tried  
  to bury me alive last night.  

19:38.078 --> 19:39.978
(moans)                         
                  (screams)     

19:40.046 --> 19:41.347
                         (moans)

19:42.282 --> 19:43.682
                         What?  

19:43.750 --> 19:45.017
                  Come on, I was
                kidding, man.   

19:45.085 --> 19:46.085
              What are you      
                 doing?         

19:46.152 --> 19:47.553
         Sam, I hit her         
         with a shovel          

19:47.620 --> 19:48.787
      and she's come back       
            for me.             

19:48.855 --> 19:49.822
                          What?!

19:49.889 --> 19:51.924
      And you fell for it.      

19:53.927 --> 19:55.794
                Mother, what are
              you talking about?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.129
            (laughs)            

19:57.197 --> 19:59.665
     I was just having fun      
      with the young man.       

19:59.733 --> 20:01.066
I got the idea                  

20:01.134 --> 20:03.102
when I heard that he was        
working in the graveyard.       

20:03.169 --> 20:05.004
It was just too rich            
to pass up.                     

20:05.071 --> 20:06.271
              Wait a minute.    

20:06.339 --> 20:07.873
              How-how'd you find
                 out about that?

20:07.941 --> 20:10.843
 Oh, that's the wonderful thing 
      about a hearing aid.      

20:10.910 --> 20:13.345
  When you turn it up, you can  
hear all kinds of things.       

20:13.413 --> 20:14.713
Incidentally,                   

20:14.781 --> 20:16.482
Elliott, you're out of the will.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.486
                 Sorry, Elliott.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.988
You mean this was               
all a joke?                     

20:23.056 --> 20:24.656
         That's right.          

20:24.724 --> 20:26.658
Well, you crazy old...          
          Hey, hey, hey, Wood...

20:26.726 --> 20:27.926
                          KELLY:
                     Woody, what
                 are you doing?!

20:27.994 --> 20:29.561
            That's it, Woody.   
            Get him out of here.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.563
Hold it!                        

20:31.631 --> 20:33.032
(clears throat)                 

20:33.099 --> 20:35.034
        This young man,         

20:35.101 --> 20:37.870
this young man                  
may be gullible--               

20:37.937 --> 20:40.873
oh, well, let's                 
be honest, slow--               

20:40.940 --> 20:44.143
but he had the backbone         
to stand up to me,              

20:44.210 --> 20:45.644
which no one else               
in the family                   

20:45.712 --> 20:47.179
has ever had                    
the courage to do.              

20:47.247 --> 20:49.548
I think you're going to         
be very good for Kelly.         

20:49.616 --> 20:52.184
In fact, I think you're going   
to be good for all of us.       

20:52.252 --> 20:53.752
I give you my blessing.         

20:53.820 --> 20:55.521
Welcome to the family.          

20:55.588 --> 20:57.089
Now, let's eat.                 

21:00.493 --> 21:02.695
Can I go to sleep now?          

21:02.762 --> 21:04.763
                      Sure.     

21:21.781 --> 21:24.183
            Say, uh, Rebecca,   

21:24.250 --> 21:25.918
  for ten bucks I'll tell you   
  how to get even with Carla,   

21:25.985 --> 21:28.921
                 for closing you
                 up in the wall.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.290
             Okay.              

21:33.360 --> 21:35.127
    Here's her purse.           

21:35.195 --> 21:36.528
          Toss it back          
         into the duct.         

21:36.596 --> 21:37.863
When she goes in after it,      

21:37.931 --> 21:39.498
      screw the vent cover      
            back on.            
Oh,                             

21:39.566 --> 21:40.699
      that's a good idea.       

21:41.801 --> 21:42.768
    Whoo!                       

21:42.836 --> 21:44.636
(laughs)                        
Whoa!                           

21:44.704 --> 21:46.138
Wait a minute.                  

21:46.206 --> 21:48.140
That's <i>my</i> purse.                
                    Oh!         

21:49.242 --> 21:51.010
                      I'm sorry.
Oh...                           

21:51.077 --> 21:52.277
                    God.        

21:54.080 --> 21:56.015
                     (straining)
