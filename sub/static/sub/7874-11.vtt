WEBVTT

00:34.859 --> 00:37.278
Attention, everyone.
I have incredible news.

00:37.445 --> 00:39.030
The war in Iraq is over?

00:39.197 --> 00:43.116
Better.
We're getting a Ping-Pong table.

00:43.867 --> 00:46.661
Alma. Alma, wake the kids.
It's finally happened.

00:46.828 --> 00:49.331
In order to have easy access
to the water fountain...

00:49.497 --> 00:52.792
...we'll be setting up
our green mistress right here.

00:52.959 --> 00:54.793
But my desk is right here.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.797
Not to worry.
I know just where to put you.

01:00.341 --> 01:02.885
Your cover's been blown?
Where are you?

01:03.052 --> 01:06.846
I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
You're in What-istan?

01:09.349 --> 01:12.226
The worst day. Stupid boss.

01:13.478 --> 01:15.146
Robbery!

01:16.648 --> 01:17.857
Dad, stop.

01:18.024 --> 01:20.275
That's Paco,
Greg and Terry's dog walker.

01:20.442 --> 01:23.153
Sorry, honey, I can't hear you
over the street justice.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.865
Their dog must have gotten off-leash
and he was chasing after him.

01:31.285 --> 01:33.245
Thank you, Hayley. Oh, I must hurry.

01:33.412 --> 01:36.707
If I'm late, Misters Greg and Terry
give me so many pinches.

01:36.874 --> 01:40.127
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast, padre.
I still need to see some ID.

01:40.294 --> 01:44.047
Dad, he doesn't have any.
He's an unregistered visitor.

01:44.214 --> 01:46.257
You mean an illegal alien?

01:47.467 --> 01:51.137
What happened to the land of the free?
These people have a right to be here.

01:51.304 --> 01:54.766
People? They're parasites
sucking on the rich blood of America.

01:54.933 --> 01:57.267
And we need that blood
to shed for oil.

02:01.313 --> 02:03.232
Your thing looks more interesting.

02:03.399 --> 02:05.275
Out of my way, I have band practice.

02:05.442 --> 02:06.610
- Oh, do you think...?
- No.

02:06.777 --> 02:08.568
- But I could...
- No.

02:08.735 --> 02:12.240
Oh, he shut you down.
What are you gonna do? Cry?

02:12.407 --> 02:16.119
No, I'm gonna walk out of here,
because I have legs.

02:18.746 --> 02:22.124
Did you know Greg and Terry
have an illegal alien walking their dog?

02:22.290 --> 02:24.710
Isn't it terrible?
I'd be way too uncomfortable...

02:24.876 --> 02:28.422
...having some poor immigrant
working for me like that.

02:28.588 --> 02:31.717
Oh, are you done? I was hoping
you'd talk more about yourself.

02:31.883 --> 02:35.719
- Well, aren't you a grumposaurus.
- I'm a grumposaurus rex.

02:35.886 --> 02:37.847
Bullock moved my desk
to the bathroom.

02:38.013 --> 02:41.058
I'm so sick and tired of that job.
I want to be my own boss.

02:41.225 --> 02:43.561
I want to make so much money
I can tell people...

02:43.727 --> 02:45.729
...they can kiss my firm, white ass.

02:45.895 --> 02:47.730
That's the American dream.

02:47.897 --> 02:49.858
Today made me realize...

02:50.024 --> 02:53.194
...it's time for me
to follow my true destiny.

02:53.361 --> 02:58.116
- Oh, no. Not this again.
- Yes, Francine. This again.

02:58.782 --> 03:00.701
My holiday Cele-Bear-Tions.

03:00.868 --> 03:03.454
A different handmade bear
for every holiday.

03:03.620 --> 03:06.623
Look at him. How cute is he?
Go on, tell him you don't love him.

03:06.790 --> 03:09.585
He's cute.
But I still have a problem with the name.

03:09.751 --> 03:14.088
"Cele-Bear-Tion." It sounds like a cross
between "celibate" and "abortion".

03:14.589 --> 03:18.259
I told you, Francine, I heard your note,
I considered it, and I don't agree.

03:18.426 --> 03:21.679
And you've never once gotten them
in stores in time for a holiday.

03:23.388 --> 03:25.849
Merry... Crap.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.686
Happy Valentine's... Crap.

03:29.853 --> 03:32.355
Maybe I would have made a holiday
if you'd helped me.

03:32.522 --> 03:37.151
- But no, you have a phobia of needles.
- Hey, you have a phobia of seagulls.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.904
A seagull? Where?
Don't let it touch me with its feet.

03:40.070 --> 03:42.239
There's no seagull.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.450
Anyway, this time I'm going to do it.

03:44.950 --> 03:48.828
My bears will be on shelves
by May 14th, in time for Mother's Day...

03:48.995 --> 03:50.788
...so help me God.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.750
I did it.
I finished the Mother's Day bears.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.169
- It's June.
- Crap.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.671
Maybe now
you'll give this bear thing up.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.923
Never.
Father's Day is the next big holiday.

04:01.089 --> 04:02.549
I just need to hire some help.

04:02.716 --> 04:05.510
Stan, you're sinking
an awful lot of money into this.

04:05.677 --> 04:07.846
It's the American dream, Francine.

04:08.013 --> 04:10.807
Looks like we'll have to
dip into the fund.

04:10.974 --> 04:12.935
- Which one?
- The PDF.

04:13.101 --> 04:14.226
No!

04:29.449 --> 04:31.076
Hello?

04:31.242 --> 04:33.411
That's awesome. Thanks.

04:33.954 --> 04:36.539
Good news, guys.
We've just been asked to perform...

04:36.706 --> 04:39.333
...at this year's Langley Falls
4th of July Festival.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.919
Steve and the Asstones
are on our way.

04:42.086 --> 04:45.547
- Hey!
- Awesome! Yeah!

04:46.507 --> 04:50.052
- Jerry, what are you doing?
- Nothing, man.

04:50.593 --> 04:52.720
We told you, no drugs.

04:52.887 --> 04:54.847
And I told you if I was responsible...

04:55.014 --> 04:59.394
...I wouldn't be in a band
with a bunch of 14-year-olds.

05:04.022 --> 05:06.441
Two hours, seven minutes. Not bad.

05:06.608 --> 05:08.068
And your résumé looks good.

05:08.235 --> 05:10.904
Six months as a receipt checker
at Best Buy.

05:11.071 --> 05:13.699
- That was a super-hard job.
- I'm sure, I'm sure.

05:13.865 --> 05:17.743
You're hired. I'll pay you 4.50 an hour
and all the Mr. Pibb you can drink.

05:17.910 --> 05:21.080
No, that's not how it works, man.
Minimum wage is $ 7 an hour.

05:21.247 --> 05:24.083
I'll also need health insurance,
two weeks paid vacation...

05:24.250 --> 05:27.378
...sick days, pension fund.
- They gave you all that at Best Buy?

05:27.545 --> 05:32.257
- I can't afford to do that.
- Hello, Father. You remember Paco.

05:33.258 --> 05:35.635
- What the hell is going on?
- We're dating now.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.512
Because Paco is a person.

05:37.679 --> 05:41.390
Not a parasite
sucking on the blood of America.

05:44.351 --> 05:45.686
That means "more tongue."

05:45.853 --> 05:48.397
No daughter of mine
is dating an illegal alien.

05:48.564 --> 05:50.649
You're dead to me.

05:53.484 --> 05:57.488
Wow. Paco must be Mexican
for "lightning hands".

05:57.655 --> 05:59.615
How would you like
to come work for me?

05:59.782 --> 06:03.077
I'll pay you $2 an hour
and all the Mr. Pibb you can drink.

06:03.244 --> 06:06.079
- Maximum two a day.
- At Best Buy we had a slushy machine.

06:06.246 --> 06:09.166
Why don't you just marry Best Buy
if you love it so much?

06:14.796 --> 06:17.591
Great job, Paco.
I might just make a holiday yet.

06:17.757 --> 06:19.842
Then I'll have "kiss my ass" money.

06:20.009 --> 06:21.051
This is outrageous.

06:21.218 --> 06:24.096
Kiss my ass, Hayley.
It's already working.

06:30.977 --> 06:33.688
Dude, that rocked. Who are you?

06:34.731 --> 06:36.733
I'm Krispy Kreme McDonalds.

06:36.900 --> 06:40.612
My Krispy Kreme mama got raped
by my McDonald's daddy.

06:42.363 --> 06:43.405
What are you doing?

06:43.572 --> 06:47.075
I don't have any bones in my arms,
which makes me a natural on the drums.

06:47.242 --> 06:50.787
Plus I love music, Steve.
I can't live without my jams.

06:50.954 --> 06:54.833
I gotta rock it. Gotta rock it. Gotta do it.
If you don't know, now you know.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.585
Forget it. I think we should
go with our first choice:

06:57.752 --> 06:59.420
Toshi's sister, Akiko.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.383
I'm thirsty from rocking it so hard.

07:04.550 --> 07:08.094
Who wants a Smirnoff Ice
and some bootleg Ukrainian porn?

07:08.595 --> 07:12.265
All in favor of making Krispy Kreme
McDonalds our new drummer?

07:27.404 --> 07:31.492
Mr. Smith, we've sold out
of your adorable bears.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.410
Yes, I knew it.
You're over, Paddington.

07:34.577 --> 07:38.331
So take your little rain slicker and your
little boots and go die in an alley.

07:38.498 --> 07:42.085
- Do you have any more bears?
- Unfortunately, no. But I do have this.

07:42.251 --> 07:46.171
Paco, a prototype
for my next holiday Cele-Bear-Tion.

07:48.465 --> 07:51.176
I love him.

07:51.343 --> 07:52.386
I'll take a thousand.

07:52.552 --> 07:55.347
And another thousand
to sell in my store.

07:57.932 --> 08:00.935
It's happening.
I'm finally making my dream come true.

08:01.102 --> 08:04.730
We're gonna need help to fill an order
that big. Do you have any relatives?

08:04.897 --> 08:07.400
No, I am an only child.

08:07.566 --> 08:10.944
I'm kidding. I'm Mexican.

08:11.111 --> 08:15.782
Oh, the sweet sound of illegals
working for pennies on the dollar.

08:18.118 --> 08:20.537
Stan, could you help me
bring the groceries in?

08:20.704 --> 08:23.038
Sure.
Paco, tell number 14 and number 8...

08:23.205 --> 08:27.042
...to go upstairs and help my wife.
- Oh, no. Stan, that's not their job.

08:27.209 --> 08:30.170
No, it's your job,
but they're gonna help you.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.464
Stan, I almost forgot.

08:32.631 --> 08:35.133
- Patti LaBelle's here to see you.
- What?

08:35.299 --> 08:39.345
At first I thought it was Aretha Franklin,
but then she said she wasn't.

08:40.929 --> 08:43.765
Miss LaBelle, Stan Smith.
I love R & B music.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.769
I consider the whole genre
one long song.

08:46.936 --> 08:49.896
Darling, I'm here because
I'm a big fan of your bears.

08:50.063 --> 08:54.401
A friend showed me one and,
honey, Miss Patti just loved them.

08:54.568 --> 08:59.322
I would like to sell them
on my Shopping Network show.

09:00.072 --> 09:03.367
Would you be able to hold us both up
if I add my legs to this hug?

09:03.534 --> 09:04.869
Unload those in the kitchen.

09:05.035 --> 09:07.496
Perishables in the fridge,
dry goods in the pantry.

09:08.122 --> 09:10.166
Miss LaBelle, are you thirsty?

09:10.332 --> 09:13.460
Esperanza,
get Patti LaBelle a Calistoga.

09:30.809 --> 09:34.521
Hack. Hacky. Hack and the Hacktones.

09:34.688 --> 09:37.607
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's hear one of your songs.

09:43.446 --> 09:47.658
You got nothing. This is my band,
so we're gonna do what I want.

09:47.825 --> 09:51.077
If you don't like it,
we're got Akiko is waiting in the wings.

09:56.208 --> 09:59.628
- Stan, isn't he just adorable?
- That he is, Patti.

09:59.794 --> 10:02.713
Stan, did you know
that in some countries...

10:02.880 --> 10:05.174
...the bear is considered a demigod?

10:05.341 --> 10:08.344
No, I didn't, Patti. Did you know
that in the gay community...

10:08.511 --> 10:11.597
...a hairy man is also known as a bear?

10:12.181 --> 10:13.766
No.

10:13.933 --> 10:17.227
Well, Stan, it looks like
we have a special guest with us...

10:17.393 --> 10:19.103
...in the studio today.

10:19.270 --> 10:22.482
It's Oscar.
He's a huge fan of your bears.

10:22.649 --> 10:28.153
In fact, maybe the love
of one of your bears will heal him.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.409
Praise Jesus.

10:34.576 --> 10:38.205
The bear gave him the confidence
to try and fail.

10:38.372 --> 10:41.832
Did he fail because our viewers
didn't buy enough bears?

10:41.999 --> 10:44.001
Yes. He says yes.

10:45.503 --> 10:48.464
I still can't believe it.
Over a hundred-thousand orders.

10:48.631 --> 10:52.134
Our dream is finally coming true.
Why are they throwing tortilla chips...

10:52.300 --> 10:56.846
...in front of you?
- Because it makes me feel like a princess.

11:01.267 --> 11:05.479
What's this? You were supposed
to be working all night. Where's Paco?

11:06.230 --> 11:08.148
Get up. What's going on?

11:08.315 --> 11:11.110
Sorry, Señor Smith.
I was out late with Hayley.

11:11.276 --> 11:13.153
You have a big future here, Paco.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.823
In ten years,
you could be making 5 bucks an hour...

11:15.990 --> 11:17.657
...and be up to seven Pibbs a day.

11:42.430 --> 11:44.890
What are you doing?
Rehearsal doesn't start for three hours.

11:45.057 --> 11:48.144
Steve, good you're here.
I meant to call you. How do I put this?

11:48.310 --> 11:50.187
- You're out of the band.
- What?

11:50.354 --> 11:53.315
We decided to go in a different direction
and voted you out.

11:53.482 --> 11:58.820
We're now Krispy Kreme McDonalds'
Jamtastic Roller-Boogie Prawn Experience.

11:58.987 --> 12:01.698
But we're supposed to play
the July 4th Festival.

12:01.865 --> 12:04.451
Yeah, the Prawn Experience
also booked that gig.

12:04.617 --> 12:08.203
See? We go on right before you
and your nonexistent Asstones.

12:08.370 --> 12:10.372
Yeah?
Well, what kind of music do you play?

12:10.539 --> 12:12.207
We cover public-domain songs.

12:12.374 --> 12:14.376
"Camptown Races,"
"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep".

12:14.543 --> 12:17.337
We got over a hundred hits already.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.342
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna
tell you about a little place I know.

12:23.509 --> 12:27.138
A little place called London Bridge.

12:27.305 --> 12:30.141
It's falling down.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.690
Hayley,
I'm here because of your father.

12:38.857 --> 12:42.569
He said I was spending too much time
with you, and not focusing on my career.

12:42.736 --> 12:44.237
So I must break up with you.

12:44.404 --> 12:47.823
<i>What? No.
I'd let you give me a mole frijole.</i>

12:47.990 --> 12:51.285
That's the most intimate thing
a white woman can give a Mexican man.

12:51.452 --> 12:56.540
- I have to get back to work. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you will be sorry.

12:57.707 --> 13:00.418
Mom, Roger stole my band.

13:00.585 --> 13:03.505
Oh, that's awful.
You must need a hug.

13:03.671 --> 13:04.714
Consuela!

13:18.018 --> 13:20.771
Stan Smith? Agent Hopkins, INS.

13:20.938 --> 13:24.732
We received a report
that you're harboring illegal aliens.

13:32.281 --> 13:35.450
So, INS, huh? I'm a CIA man, myself.

13:35.617 --> 13:37.577
I suppose that kind of
makes us brothers.

13:37.744 --> 13:41.039
My brother died in a car crash
when I was 11.

13:42.624 --> 13:43.750
Cars.

13:44.751 --> 13:46.586
Well, no sign of any illegals.

13:46.753 --> 13:48.921
That anonymous tip we got
was clearly bogus.

13:49.088 --> 13:52.508
Really? Why don't you check
the basement, officers?

13:59.265 --> 14:01.307
There was a whole
sweatshop down there.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.809
Where'd they all go?

14:07.939 --> 14:11.775
I don't know what you did,
but I am not gonna let you...

14:13.443 --> 14:17.698
- Sorry again for wasting your time.
- Please, don't give it another...

14:18.740 --> 14:22.786
Oh, you don't have to pick that up.
Inez... I mean Maria... No, no, Elizabeth.

14:22.953 --> 14:26.956
Miss Elizabeth Protestant England
will get it. She is our white, legal maid.

14:27.540 --> 14:30.418
Right. Right.

14:30.584 --> 14:32.712
I'll be seeing you around, Agent Smith.

14:34.672 --> 14:37.590
- He's onto us. They'll be back.
- What are we gonna do?

14:37.757 --> 14:40.135
I have to get those bears
shipped out by tomorrow.

14:40.301 --> 14:43.513
- They're gonna have to work all night.
- Well, they can't work here.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.682
The fuzz is crawling all over this joint.

14:45.849 --> 14:48.101
There's an old
CIA warehouse downtown.

14:48.268 --> 14:51.395
I can move the workers there.
I can sneak them out later tonight.

14:51.562 --> 14:53.814
Just be careful, Stan.
And keep moving.

14:53.981 --> 14:57.359
If you stop for more than five minutes,
they'll have a barbecue.

15:01.654 --> 15:03.823
Thanks for helping me
sneak the Mexicans out.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.159
The INS has been
watching this place all day.

15:06.325 --> 15:08.286
Well, I didn't have anything else to do.

15:08.453 --> 15:11.122
My band was supposed to perform
in the festival tonight.

15:11.289 --> 15:12.999
I really just don't wanna be alone.

15:13.166 --> 15:16.293
Steve, you see that button right there?
That rolls up the window.

15:16.460 --> 15:20.881
Push it,
so we don't have to do this anymore.

15:21.047 --> 15:22.507
All right, we're in the clear.

15:24.342 --> 15:27.011
Something wrong with your car,
Agent Smith?

15:27.178 --> 15:29.346
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

15:29.513 --> 15:34.310
Carl, fix Agent Smith's car
so that it will start.

15:38.439 --> 15:42.233
- Who are the Mexicans, Stan?
- Oh, they're...

15:42.400 --> 15:46.154
They're in my son's band.
They're playing the festival this evening.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.782
May I see their papers?

15:49.365 --> 15:52.159
Okay, you got me.
These people aren't legal.

15:52.326 --> 15:56.413
Let me just have them for tonight
so my son can play with his band.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.626
Fine. They can sing in the festival.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.629
But only because that is what I want.

16:03.795 --> 16:06.964
Now, if you will all get into your van,
we will escort you there.

16:07.131 --> 16:09.842
- No escort will be necessary.
- Necessary?

16:10.009 --> 16:11.052
A pleasure.

16:11.219 --> 16:14.764
I'll enjoy some music, then
take them in after their performance.

16:14.931 --> 16:18.475
Afterwards, I'll probably just
finish up paperwork at the office...

16:18.642 --> 16:21.561
...and answer e-mails.

16:46.042 --> 16:49.420
Stan, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be at the warehouse.

16:49.587 --> 16:53.508
The INS was waiting for us, so I lied and
said the Mexicans were in Steve's band.

16:53.675 --> 16:56.343
Now I don't know how we're gonna
get out of here... Wait.

16:56.510 --> 17:00.138
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know, I usually do what you do.

17:18.281 --> 17:20.906
Yeah!

17:21.574 --> 17:23.367
Say, Steve, what just happened was...

17:23.535 --> 17:25.912
...I saw a million faces
and I rocked them all.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.039
Follow that, bitch.

17:28.205 --> 17:32.793
<i>Next up, Steve and the Asstones.</i>

17:33.335 --> 17:35.587
Here's what we do.
After they finish singing...

17:35.754 --> 17:38.549
...we sneak the Mexicans out
and drive to the warehouse.

17:38.716 --> 17:43.178
We lock ourselves in until they finish the
bears, then we turn them over to the INS.

17:43.345 --> 17:44.595
Yes, uh-huh, I'm with you.

17:44.762 --> 17:48.307
They get deported and we buy our way
out of trouble because we'll be rich.

17:48.474 --> 17:52.061
Plus we're white.
And I'm blonde, the best kind of white.

17:53.438 --> 17:57.441
- You guys know any English songs?
- There is one song we know.

17:57.941 --> 18:01.236
Hello, Father. Wondering how
I escaped from the basement?

18:01.403 --> 18:05.365
- No, not really.
- But it involved training rats.

18:05.532 --> 18:08.535
Hello, everyone.
We got a real treat for you tonight.

18:08.701 --> 18:11.996
Paco and his family here
used to sing this song back in Mexico...

18:12.163 --> 18:14.373
...while dreaming
of coming to America.

18:56.704 --> 18:59.873
My God.
Listen to them sing about America.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.001
They aren't parasites. They're people.

19:03.168 --> 19:05.962
Paco and his family feel lucky
just to be in this country.

19:06.129 --> 19:09.132
All we do is take it for granted
and they're willing to work...

19:09.299 --> 19:12.259
...in my basement for soda.
Soda that I watered down.

19:12.426 --> 19:14.553
It's not about having
"kiss my ass" money.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.973
It's about being here
in the greatest country in the world.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.352
That's the American dream, Francine.

19:21.852 --> 19:25.939
Okay. But can I just have one
to help me with the laundry?

19:26.105 --> 19:28.566
There's just so much laundry, Stan.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.945
I'm a hypocrite too, Dad.
I used Paco to get at you...

19:32.111 --> 19:35.031
...then tried to throw him away
by calling INS.

19:35.198 --> 19:37.366
You heartless bitch. I'm kidding.

19:37.533 --> 19:39.117
We can't let INS take them.

19:39.284 --> 19:43.038
We need to cause a distraction
so we can sneak them out.

19:44.790 --> 19:47.292
Are you sure?
You'd be giving up your dream.

19:47.459 --> 19:49.293
I'm sure.

20:18.028 --> 20:20.614
We're Steve and the Ass-todos.

20:28.246 --> 20:31.457
Who wants a free holiday bear?

20:36.629 --> 20:38.755
Hey, mine.

20:58.441 --> 21:01.319
There it is, Paco. Sweet freedom.

21:03.570 --> 21:05.530
Look, Ma, Mexicans.

21:05.697 --> 21:09.367
Like the fast mouse
in them Bugs Bunny cartoons.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.787
I like beans and such.

21:48.779 --> 21:50.864
