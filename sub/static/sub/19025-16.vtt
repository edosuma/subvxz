00:03.880 --> 00:07.236
Carol, I know you think you look
dashing in your navy blue scrubs

00:07.320 --> 00:10.517
but I can't deal with the fact
that I walk into this place

00:10.600 --> 00:12.795
and find you
standing there talking at me.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.030
- All I said was good morning.
- Exactly.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.873
And who in God's name
wants to hear that every day?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.313
Good morning.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.916
In the immortal words of Daffy Duck,
I demand that you shoot me now.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.558
If only.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.596
<i>I couldn't help but think two things.</i>

00:27.680 --> 00:31.878
<i>First, I do look great in these navy</i>
<i>scrubs. Come on, who wants a taste?</i>

00:31.960 --> 00:34.599
<i>Second, eve</i> ry <i>one's day</i>
<i>begins differently here.</i>

00:35.600 --> 00:38.637
<i>The surgeons, for instance,</i>
<i>are a superstitious bunch.</i>

00:38.720 --> 00:41.996
<i>They start their mornings</i>
<i>with an oddly homoerotic ass slap.</i>

00:42.080 --> 00:43.752
Dude, too deep.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.638
<i>And then their own good luck rituals.</i>

00:54.360 --> 00:56.590
Where's my lucky Tabasco do-rag?

00:57.360 --> 00:59.271
Why don't you use Power Rangers?

00:59.360 --> 01:01.920
How are Power Rangers
as lucky as Tabasco?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.072
Do you remember
when the Megazord was destroyed?

01:05.160 --> 01:08.072
How did I miss that episode?
Oh, that's right,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.674
I was making love to a woman.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.516
Power Rangers, ho!

01:14.360 --> 01:17.113
<i>All you can hope is</i>
<i>that nothing bites you on the ass.</i>

01:17.200 --> 01:19.760
Gaby, all set
for your bone marrow transplant?

01:19.840 --> 01:23.549
I'm scared. I wanted to bring my stuffed
pink doggie with me

01:23.640 --> 01:25.358
but mean nurse says I can't.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.670
Well, I promise you, you'll have it.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.831
Honestly, Mean Nurse,
why would you say that?

01:31.920 --> 01:34.878
Because she lost her stuffed
pink doggie two days ago.

01:36.160 --> 01:37.149
Frick.

01:42.280 --> 01:46.512
Since I've been wearing that do-rag,
my surgery record's like 23 and 0.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.114
Are you counting the boil
you lanced yesterday?

01:49.200 --> 01:51.350
Question: Did he die?
Answer: He did not.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.513
I gotta stick with whatever's hot.
Last month was not wearing underwear.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.479
- So why not take off your underwear?
- That's what I keep telling him.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.711
- Todd knows about the underwear thing?
- No.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.951
The do-rag still has the juice. Can you
imagine what could happen without it?

02:12.600 --> 02:14.352
I can't find any obstruction.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.670
Keep looking, it must be there.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.631
I found it.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.756
Powerful tiny fists.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.511
He's back.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074

02:48.880 --> 02:51.394
<i>Some people say</i>
<i>everything comes down to luck.</i>

02:51.960 --> 02:53.916
I need my lucky do-rag.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.876
<i>I believe that the most minor event,</i>

02:56.960 --> 03:00.669
<i>even a butterfly flapping its wings,</i>
<i>can affect everything.</i>

03:08.880 --> 03:10.996
Hillside landing.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.913
<i>Once that seemingly</i>
<i>insignificant event happens...</i>

03:14.000 --> 03:15.877
What is wrong with you?

03:16.480 --> 03:18.914
Baby, I wasn't looking
at her lovelies, OK?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.276
I was looking at the butterfly
that happened to land on them.

03:22.360 --> 03:28.390
Who could blame it? There they are
all snuggly and safe and whatnot.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.789
<i>It sets everything else in motion.</i>

03:30.880 --> 03:32.108
Uncomfortable.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.474
- OK, who do I kill?
- She did it.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.348
Man, I don't wanna clean this up.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.908
Then you picked
the wrong day to be the janitor.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.393
Could you help me find
a little girl's pink doggie?

03:53.480 --> 03:56.358
I would love to, darling,
but I'm a bit busy right now.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.437
<i>And insignificant events</i>
<i>can lead to significant events,</i>

04:00.520 --> 04:03.398
<i>like me being on time</i>
<i>and Dr Cox being late for a change.</i>

04:03.480 --> 04:06.916
Where the hell's Dr Cox?
His shift started four minutes ago.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.434
<i>You've got to cover for him.</i>

04:24.080 --> 04:25.957
I have to learn to play the banjo.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.395
- Son, are you listening to me?
- Yes, sir.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.993
<i>And buy a banjo.</i>

04:30.080 --> 04:32.116
Hey fellas, what did I miss?

04:32.200 --> 04:33.952
<i>And here he is.</i>

04:34.040 --> 04:36.838
Suddenly I'm getting
the most intense headache.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.431
Let me see if this relieves the pain.

04:39.960 --> 04:44.112
Better. Worse. Better. Worse.
I could do this all day.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.433
Dr Dorian was on time and you were busy
doing that hilarious better <i>l</i> worse bit,

04:49.520 --> 04:51.829
so maybe you should
answer to him all day.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.638
Dr Kelso, that's my pen.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.631
- Nice grab.
- Well, I'm a lefty.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.191
My head's going to melt when I say this,
but Kelso's idea wasn't half bad.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.875
Letting you run this place
would be a great educational experience.

05:05.960 --> 05:10.715
And let's face facts, the training bra
has got to come off eventually.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.439
So, it's your show, Debbie.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.353
Is this moment just the way
you always pictured it?

05:17.640 --> 05:19.551
It's your show, Debbie.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.074
Is this moment just
like you always pictured?

05:24.280 --> 05:26.475
Stupid home-made dolls.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.671
It's a little bigger.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.517
Turk, I just got off of a 12-hour shift.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.991
I'm starving and need to take a bathroom
break, which is why I'm dancing.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.629
And you want me to run home
and bring back your lucky do-rag?

05:41.720 --> 05:43.676
And could you be back in 20 minutes?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.558
Nurse Espinosa,
your shift ended nine minutes ago.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.631
Why isn't your time card punched out?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.631
- Well, sir, I...
- Dr Kelso,

05:50.720 --> 05:55.669
how is it you had an ambulance take you
to your dinner reservation last night?

05:55.760 --> 05:57.034
How do you know that?

05:57.120 --> 06:02.148
I'm the homeboy you screamed at
to get my ghetto-mobile off the road.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.399
Turk, I don't need you
to fight my battles for me.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.789
It makes me look like
I can't defend myself.

06:11.880 --> 06:16.795
You're absolutely right, baby
and I apologise. Remember, do-rag.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.669
Hello?

06:31.760 --> 06:33.478
It's Elliot, what are you doing?

06:34.480 --> 06:35.799
Nothing disgusting.

06:35.880 --> 06:39.316
I can't find that girl's
little pink doggie anywhere.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.994
I got a pink doggie for you
but it is not little.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.594
Show me your penis
and I'll take it away from you.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.475
Cool.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.438
- Yeah, that was Todd.
- <i>Don't wor</i> ry <i>about the doggie.</i>

06:50.520 --> 06:52.431
I'll be right there.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.635
I've had nausea and stomach pains
for a couple of days now.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.756
I don't wanna tell you how to live,

07:03.840 --> 07:06.718
but maybe you should avoid
sushi from the Gas 'N' Go.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.509
It came free with the fill-up.
Am I supposed to just throw it away?

07:10.600 --> 07:13.831
Yes, you are. Fortunately, though,
your vitals are normal,

07:13.920 --> 07:16.798
so we'll check back with you in a while.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.276
- It sounds to me like a GI bleed.
- It sounds to me like angina.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.999
If you leave this hospital
knowing only one thing,

07:24.080 --> 07:27.117
and there's a pre <i>tty</i> good chance
that just might happen,

07:27.200 --> 07:31.318
let that one thing be this,
medicine is a collaborative effort.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.675
Your opinion is
just as important as mine.

07:33.760 --> 07:38.914
So let's see if you've got the
gobstoppers to take the lead. Be me.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.319
<i>Come on, you can do this.</i>
<i>Navy scrubs, navy scrubs.</i>

07:45.920 --> 07:50.072
Here's the deal, Eleanor, we're gonna
get a full work-up on this guy.

07:50.160 --> 07:53.197
So while I drop an NG tube
and do a gastric lavage,

07:53.280 --> 07:56.909
why don't you get an order on EKG
with cardiac biomarkers.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.073
They're on page 37
of the Ann Taylor catalogue

08:01.160 --> 08:03.754
right next to
that salmon cable-knit sweater

08:03.840 --> 08:06.638
you want
but haven't had the courage to order.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.597
You're worried the weave is so thin

08:08.680 --> 08:12.229
your nipples might peak
their little pink selves through.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.390
Isn't that right, Dr Cox?

08:19.600 --> 08:24.469
I'm sorry, here I was in my own little
world, dreaming about candy bracelets.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.471
I don't like candy bracelets.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.913
<i>I love them.</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:32.755
<i>Now grab that elevator. But not without</i>
<i>giving him his patented shoulder bump.</i>

08:32.840 --> 08:33.828
Good day.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.431
How you like me now?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.873
Find your pink doggie yet?

08:44.960 --> 08:47.872
Nope, but I met Helen,
the laundry room lady.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.269
- Does she have blonde hair?
- No.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.588
Brown hair?

08:51.680 --> 08:54.194
- No hair? It's from the dryers.
- That's the one.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.350
Hey, the janitor's still downstairs.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.954
Why don't we just check
in his custodial closet?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.075
Hey, you're not welcome here.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.320
- What's up?
- Randall?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.152
Just got the job, bro.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.152
So that's why he's been
back in my dreams.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.151
- Beat it.
- Gotta go.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.112
Did you bring my lucky do-rag?

09:34.240 --> 09:37.152
Why don't you wear the puppies do-rag
I got you for Lent?

09:37.240 --> 09:40.869
The fluffy puppies killed three people.
They banned from the OR.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.032
Well, what do you want me
to do, Turk? I forgot.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.398
You never pay attention to the
little things that are important to me.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.512
<i>When one thing goes wrong around here,</i>
<i>everything seems to go wrong.</i>

09:53.600 --> 09:55.875
- What happened?
- Vitals are tanking.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.635
- No pulse in the lower extremities.
- There were no signs of distress.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.517
Come on, we gotta make a decision.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.909
Let's get him a CT angiogram, stat.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.234
Good.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.875
- It's an aortic dissection. It's bad.
- Tell surgery we're on our way.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.953
<i>In a hospital,</i>
<i>it's hard to avoid letting people down.</i>

10:15.040 --> 10:17.474
<i>Whether it's someone</i>
<i>you made a promise to...</i>

10:17.560 --> 10:20.233
- I want my doggie.
- I'm so sorry.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.231
- Let's go, Gandhi, you're on.
- <i>Or someone you love...</i>

10:25.320 --> 10:27.788
- I gotta go.
- Turk, I'm sorry.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.599
<i>Or even someone you barely knew at all.</i>

10:49.640 --> 10:52.473
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>it's the "what ifs" that hurt the most.</i>

10:52.560 --> 10:55.233
<i>Like what if things</i>
<i>had gone a little differently?</i>

10:55.320 --> 10:59.632
It's just that aortic dissections
are a doctor's worst nightmare.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.439
There's about a 90% mortality rate.

11:02.520 --> 11:06.638
Unless your patient was lucky enough
to fall into a CAT scan machine,

11:06.720 --> 11:08.631
he wasn't gonna have a happy ending.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.508
Newbie, we didn't have
a chance on this one.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.830
<i>Me, I don't believe in fate.</i>

11:17.920 --> 11:21.629
<i>We have more control than we think</i>
<i>and eve</i> ry <i>action has a reaction.</i>

11:22.720 --> 11:24.438
<i>After all...</i>

11:28.800 --> 11:32.554
<i>the most minor event,</i>
<i>even a butterfly flapping its wings,</i>

11:32.640 --> 11:34.551
<i>can change everything.</i>

11:38.080 --> 11:39.991
<i>Sometimes for the better.</i>

11:40.840 --> 11:42.751
<i>Even if it doesn't seem like it.</i>

11:45.560 --> 11:47.869
- Look away.
- I can't.

11:53.080 --> 11:57.676
<i>It's funny how a seemingly insignificant</i>
<i>event can set everything else in motion.</i>

11:57.760 --> 11:59.637
Hillside landing.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.633
What is wrong with you?
You're looking at that guy's cleavage

12:03.720 --> 12:06.871
while Susie Big-Rack is busting
out of her niece's tank top.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.794
- How the hell did I miss that?
- Damn, you're whipped.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.672
- Orange Goo-goo.
- Ain't nothing here for you, mooch.

12:14.760 --> 12:15.749
All done.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.479
Could you help me look
for a pink, stuffed doggie?

12:18.560 --> 12:22.838
- I'll meet you upstairs in ten minutes.
- You are the sweetest guy.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.311
I'm blushing.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.072
Could you be half as nice to me
as you are to her?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.232
You are right.
We need a fresh start? Come on.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.276
Fresh start.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.036
I think we need a longer fresh start.

12:41.120 --> 12:46.672
- How long do you suppose this will be?
- Ten minutes. Ease into it.

12:46.760 --> 12:51.038
Let's mix it up. Let's saw some wood.
There we go. Nice. Very good.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.351
<i>And insignificant events</i>
<i>can lead to significant events.</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:57.910
<i>Like me being late because</i>
<i>I was in the world's longest handshake.</i>

12:58.000 --> 13:00.070
- What did I miss?
- Take a wild guess.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.551
<i>I should get Turk a washboard.</i>

13:11.640 --> 13:14.552
Do you think I got to be
Chief of Medicine by being late?

13:14.640 --> 13:17.871
No, Bobbo, you got there
by back-stabbing and ass-kissing.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.396
Maybe so, but I started those things
promptly at eight.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.550
Dr Kelso, that's my pen.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.031
- Nice grab.
- I'm a righty.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.475
You want me to go all the way home
and bring back your lucky do-rag?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.516
And if you could be back in 20 minutes.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.433
Nurse Espinosa,
your shift ended nine minutes ago.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.432
- Why isn't your time card punched out?
- Well, sir...

13:39.520 --> 13:42.239
Punch out on time,
or I'll punch you out on time.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.955
I don't mean that violently,
I was just trying to turn a phrase.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.109
Turk, why didn't you stand up for me?

13:51.200 --> 13:54.670
- You said I was too whipped.
- I need you to be more supportive.

13:54.760 --> 13:59.959
You're absolutely right, baby,
and I apologise. Remember, do-rag.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.717
- Hey, Helen.
- Hey, cutie.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.839
Janitor, thanks for your help. I know
that you're busy. I could call Carla...

14:11.920 --> 14:16.311
No. You mark my words, we will find that
little girl's stuffed animal.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.392
You are really taking
a personal interest in this.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.755
Mommy, where's my teddy bear?

14:24.840 --> 14:28.913
I must have accidentally thrown it out
when I was cleaning up.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.879
This never would have happened
if your room weren't so filthy.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.589
Never again.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.031
Thanks, Rowdy.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.112
By the way, as soon as we're married,
you're out of here.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.515
Basically, I've had nausea and
stomach pains for a couple of days now.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.353
You should avoid eating sushi
from the Gas 'N' Go.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.069
It came free with the fill-up.
Am I supposed to throw it away?

15:20.160 --> 15:23.391
Yes, you are. Fortunately, though,
your vitals are normal.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.869
So we'll check back
with you in a little while.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.588
- Sounds to me like a GI bleed.
- Look, Newbie,

15:29.680 --> 15:32.797
if you leave this hospital
knowing only one thing,

15:32.880 --> 15:35.917
and it looks like
there's a real chance that might happen,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.911
please let this be that one thing.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.514
I'm in charge
and don't care about your opinion.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.955
Now... go get me a cup of coffee.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.918
<i>Just avoid the shoulder bump,</i>
<i>catch the elevator</i>

15:46.000 --> 15:48.639
<i>and make a wise-ass remark</i>
<i>before the doors close.</i>

15:50.400 --> 15:54.791
Hey, Dr Cox, if you're so smart, maybe
you should just go ahead and be...

15:54.880 --> 15:56.836
You're the kinda... Dammit!

15:58.160 --> 16:01.197
I don't know what happened.
I'm usually quick and funny.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.513
So I had this guy
with vomiting and abdominal pain.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.673
Two hours and one CT later,
I tell him he's got ischemic bowel.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.355
Have you ever noticed words that rhyme
with "bowel" are always bad?

16:13.440 --> 16:19.754
Like scowl, growl...
Movies with Andie MacDowell.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.789
- You're right JD, you are funny.
- Stop!

16:25.360 --> 16:27.271
<i>Ischemic bowel.</i>

16:28.040 --> 16:29.758
<i>That's it.</i>

16:35.760 --> 16:38.433
Hey... get out of here.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.155
It's all right, Butchie, she's with me.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.038
- Where's that lost and found box?
- Over here, bro!

16:46.200 --> 16:47.918
Why does it say "free stuff'?

16:48.000 --> 16:51.595
I have no idea.
Hey, is that what you're looking for?

16:52.360 --> 16:54.112
Awesome. What time is it?

16:55.000 --> 16:55.989
4.30.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.949
Dibs.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.629
Dibs.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.907
- Butchie.
- Dude.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.718
Get back to work.

17:11.319 --> 17:14.994
- You found it.
- Of course I did.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.718
That's what I love about you.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.394
You pick up on the things
that are important to me.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.038
It's my job.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.069
<i>When one thing goes right around here,</i>
<i>everything seems to go right.</i>

17:28.880 --> 17:32.839
I know my opinion doesn't mean anything
and I'm apparently useless

17:32.920 --> 17:35.639
which deep down
you know isn't true because...

17:35.720 --> 17:37.312
Shoot, I forgot your coffee.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.039
I was thinking, we should get
a CT scan on Mr Strauss

17:40.120 --> 17:42.429
because
he might have bowel ischemia.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.715
What the hell, it can't hurt.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.754
All right.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.194
- He doesn't look ischemic.
- No, but that there

17:53.280 --> 17:56.795
is the start of an aortic dissection
and dammit, we caught it early.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.075
- Is that good?
- That's very good.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.674
Laverne, call the OR
and have it prepped.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.677
<i>In a hospital it's great</i>
<i>when you come through for someone.</i>

18:07.040 --> 18:09.508
- Thanks.
- I'll see you when you wake up.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.030
Will you be joining us, Gandhi?

18:14.120 --> 18:15.109
Good luck.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.631
I already got it.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.075
Clamp.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.676
<i>Of course, it still doesn't</i>
<i>always work out the way you'd hoped.</i>

18:38.320 --> 18:40.276
Rachel, clean up.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.072
<i>You learn to treasure</i>
<i>the times when things go your way.</i>

18:47.160 --> 18:49.037
I'm so glad you're OK.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.714
<i>And be there for the ones you love</i>
<i>when they don't.</i>

18:56.040 --> 19:00.079
<i>And you learn to accept</i>
<i>that some things are out of your hands.</i>

19:00.160 --> 19:02.310
Didn't matter when we caught it, Newbie.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.791
It was just his time.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.315
Yeah.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.035
<i>Still, with so much of life</i>
<i>left up to chance,</i>

19:15.120 --> 19:18.032
<i>you can't help</i>
<i>but look back and wonder,</i>

19:18.760 --> 19:21.069
<i>what if things had been different?</i>
