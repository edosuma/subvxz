03:35.965 --> 03:39.128
-Come along, Cabot.
-Kahn explained the game.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.293
Now back off!

03:44.874 --> 03:47.536
And you believed the fool.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.468
I remember all the hours
Dad and I spent out there.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.131
-Did you like it?
-Sure.

05:23.306 --> 05:25.467
Good.
Because for the next two months...

05:25.641 --> 05:27.973
...you're gonna toughen your mind
and your body.

05:28.644 --> 05:31.875
It's gonna make your Olympic training
look like finger-painting.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.407
Those men, among others
out there, will train you.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.212
Any questions?

05:39.222 --> 05:40.211
None.

05:43.459 --> 05:45.927
-Do you recognize him?
-The Kahn of Parmistan.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.991
What do you know about his country?

05:48.164 --> 05:52.294
It's a tiny mountain nation
in the middle of the Hindu Kush range.

05:55.405 --> 05:56.394
-This?
-I don't know.

05:56.572 --> 06:00.201
Zamir. He intends to overthrow the Kahn
and sell the country to the other side.

06:00.643 --> 06:02.110
And he's a viper.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.145
And your welfare is of no interest to him.

06:07.083 --> 06:11.213
We're interested in Parmistan
for one reason, and that's location.

06:11.521 --> 06:14.046
A Star Wars satellite station
inside Parmistan...

06:14.223 --> 06:17.192
...could monitor all the other satellites
around the world.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.727
It would be the ultimate early warning
system in case of nuclear attack.

06:20.897 --> 06:23.297
And now, in our hands...

06:23.466 --> 06:26.663
...such a system
could save millions of lives.

06:27.003 --> 06:28.937
But in the wrong hands....

06:29.105 --> 06:32.040
-It could destroy our entire nation.
-Exactly.

06:32.341 --> 06:36.744
Now the Kahn is being challenged
inside his country by a radical group.

06:36.913 --> 06:41.077
They'd like to open the borders and sell
the satellite station to the other side.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.880
Why don't we send in the troops?

06:44.053 --> 06:47.079
Direct military action is out of style,
my friend.

06:47.423 --> 06:48.651
Finesse.

06:48.991 --> 06:52.154
But there is one chance for one man.

06:52.328 --> 06:57.527
Anyone who enters Parmistan
must play the game.

06:58.201 --> 07:02.661
If he wins, he's allowed his life,
and one request.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.670
And if he loses?

07:06.776 --> 07:09.973
How do we know somebody else
hasn't already gone in and won the game?

07:10.646 --> 07:14.980
No outsider has won the game
in over 900 years.

07:15.151 --> 07:18.780
What we do know is that other countries
are training their athletes right now.

07:18.955 --> 07:21.856
A lot of people want that one request.

07:22.992 --> 07:25.222
There's someone I want you to meet.

07:26.562 --> 07:32.091
You know, your father was hampered
by a lack of knowledge about the game.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.895
Fortunately, we have a break.

07:41.177 --> 07:43.008
Jonathan Cabot...

07:43.179 --> 07:47.138
...may I present the Princess Rubali
of Parmistan.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.619
Princess.

07:55.091 --> 07:57.116
The princess is an expert at the game.

07:57.293 --> 08:00.194
And she'll be handling your training
from now on.

08:00.363 --> 08:01.955
You'll be leaving together.

08:02.298 --> 08:04.289
Part of the training, huh?

08:04.867 --> 08:06.459
What? A game?

08:09.972 --> 08:11.872
Hey. Hey, wait.

08:16.646 --> 08:20.582
What she's saying is,
don't trust anybody.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.775
Hope to tell you.

08:43.306 --> 08:46.002
There are many sounds around us.

08:46.175 --> 08:48.200
Each slightly different.

08:48.377 --> 08:51.346
So small as to go unnoticed...

08:52.782 --> 08:55.774
... by the person who is unaware.

08:56.385 --> 08:58.683
Do not hear the wood split.

08:59.155 --> 09:02.682
Hear the only sound of ax, cutting air.

09:04.493 --> 09:07.223
Read the air itself.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.097
It has much say to you.

09:10.266 --> 09:14.794
You've gotta remember,
they will skin you if you're not real good.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.270
You've gotta outsmart them,
you've gotta out-quick them.

09:18.441 --> 09:20.136
Now push it.

09:22.878 --> 09:25.142
I know I'll out-sleep them.

09:27.883 --> 09:29.373
Go ahead.

09:33.856 --> 09:34.845
No, no, no, no.

10:15.431 --> 10:16.659
Okay?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.675
One must learn to be forgiving
and generous.

10:43.859 --> 10:46.293
Not quick enough.

10:48.331 --> 10:50.822
-You're looking good.
-I'm never gonna make it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.594
-She does crazy things.
-The game's never the same.

10:53.769 --> 10:56.533
Other countries are training
their best men to defeat you.

10:56.706 --> 10:58.196
She's driving me nuts.

10:58.374 --> 11:01.366
-You know she doesn't talk?
-The princess will come around.

11:01.544 --> 11:03.068
Interesting background.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.440
Her mother was Indonesian.

11:08.117 --> 11:11.143
You know, one of the problems
that you've got to face...

11:11.320 --> 11:14.221
...is being able to distill
the essence of what you've learned.

11:14.390 --> 11:18.952
It's a subtle blend of the martial arts of the
East and the fighting skills of the West.

11:19.128 --> 11:22.723
You know, karate
and your own special gymnastics.

11:46.889 --> 11:49.380
Come on, come on.
Almost. Come on.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.455
Good morning, princess.

12:03.939 --> 12:07.204
Good morning, Jonathan.
You're looking handsome as always.

12:12.681 --> 12:13.807
Did you sleep well?

12:18.921 --> 12:20.582
Like a log.

12:44.547 --> 12:46.071
Don't trust anybody, right?

12:48.050 --> 12:51.486
Sometimes you just gotta
take a chance.

13:01.464 --> 13:03.261
You will be flown to your rendezvous...

13:03.432 --> 13:06.924
...and taken by boat
to the border town of Karabal...

13:07.102 --> 13:10.435
...about a hundred miles from Istanbul
on the Caspian Sea.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.539
From there you will meet
Colonel Mackle at the salt mines.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.804
-The salt mine?
-You'll see.

13:17.980 --> 13:21.313
Mackle will then provide you with the
necessary weapons and equipment...

13:21.484 --> 13:23.281
...for the game.

13:23.452 --> 13:25.545
-Jonathan.
-I hear you, sir.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.783
Jonathan, what town are you going to?

13:30.960 --> 13:33.292
Karabal, on the Caspian Sea.

13:36.765 --> 13:38.733
Yeah, right there.

14:39.495 --> 14:40.757
That'll be Mackle.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.630
They call him "The Stork."

14:58.047 --> 15:00.311
-I'm John Mackle, welcome to town.
-Thank you.

15:00.482 --> 15:03.576
The men will take care
of your bags. Please.

15:04.753 --> 15:08.780
-I see we're in the tour business.
-Oh, among other things here.

15:08.958 --> 15:11.256
It' s a nice boat. I suppose one of many.

15:11.427 --> 15:13.793
Well, boats and buses.

15:13.963 --> 15:17.956
-Compliments of the American taxpayer.
-It figures.

15:25.975 --> 15:28.671
A salt mine, just as Paley said.

15:28.844 --> 15:33.941
Yes. It's a place we use
from time to time. Convenient.

15:34.149 --> 15:35.377
Over here, please.

15:35.551 --> 15:39.988
As you know, no firearms of any type
are allowed in Parmistan.

15:40.155 --> 15:43.613
Get caught with a gun
and he'll chop your head off.

15:44.994 --> 15:50.762
So each of these is custom-made
with modern alloys.

15:50.933 --> 15:53.299
Looks ordinary enough, huh?

15:57.473 --> 16:01.034
-Very impressive.
-Yes.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.202
But-- Don't!

16:07.549 --> 16:08.777
Press that.

16:08.951 --> 16:13.115
The blade's spring-loaded
and it'll kill a man at 20 feet.

16:13.288 --> 16:15.518
Fine piece of work.

16:17.559 --> 16:21.188
The only way we can get you
into Parmistan is by pack mule.

16:21.363 --> 16:23.388
And then not all the way.

16:23.565 --> 16:27.831
As the princess knows, you'll have to use
your raft for the final leg of the trip.

16:28.003 --> 16:30.528
That leaves tonight, of course.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.537
You could go into town.

16:32.708 --> 16:35.199
I will send a couple of
Paley's men with you.

16:48.023 --> 16:51.186
Pick us up in front of Ahkmed's
in two hours.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.589
You like?

16:59.768 --> 17:02.293
You like, I give you good price.
I give you good price.

17:02.471 --> 17:06.531
Oh, you're from America.
Look at the quality, I give you good price.

17:07.142 --> 17:09.372
American, come back.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.542
-You are an American?
-Yeah.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.871
Yankee, go home.

17:49.118 --> 17:50.676
Don't bother, Jon.

17:50.853 --> 17:53.014
You might start a big riot.

17:53.188 --> 17:56.248
So much for Karabal nightlife.

17:58.894 --> 18:04.161
Well, there's just a little anti-American
sentiment running around, but I think--

19:40.963 --> 19:44.421
-They grabbed Rubali.
-I know. I heard. Come in. Come in.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.932
They killed the two agents.

19:47.870 --> 19:51.829
It's obvious that Zamir knows
every move we' re making.

19:52.007 --> 19:54.874
Hundreds of miles away
and he still reaches us.

19:55.043 --> 19:57.443
Not for long...

19:57.913 --> 19:59.471
... because I'll kill him.

20:00.816 --> 20:04.252
-Where's Rubali?
-In the walled city of Karabal.

20:04.419 --> 20:07.115
-But you will never get her out.
-Where is she?

20:07.289 --> 20:11.385
Tamerlane has her
at the fortified mansion of his.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.791
-And where is that?
-It's all in your briefing package.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.726
-I'm getting her out.
-Forget it.

20:16.899 --> 20:18.457
That's a terrorist training camp.

20:18.634 --> 20:23.298
Tamerlane is Zamir's man.
You're going into Parmistan alone.

20:24.006 --> 20:26.634
Just be ready for two of us, colonel.

21:55.630 --> 21:57.894
You okay? Okay?

21:58.867 --> 22:00.596
Are you okay?

22:02.104 --> 22:03.833
You'll be fine.

22:23.692 --> 22:26.889
Once the Kahn knows
that we have you...

22:27.062 --> 22:31.055
...he'll gladly relinquish his throne
in exchange of your life.

23:33.595 --> 23:34.584
Who's there?

27:18.553 --> 27:21.420
God. Come in. Come in.

27:24.159 --> 27:26.127
They were waiting for me.

27:26.761 --> 27:29.628
-The place was on alert.
-These people have spies everywhere.

27:29.798 --> 27:31.459
Lots of ears to the ground.

27:31.633 --> 27:33.828
What the hell is this, Stork?

27:34.035 --> 27:36.765
-What did you forget?
-None of this stuff has been done.

27:36.938 --> 27:38.030
Nothing's been packed.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.402
I don't think we'll be able
to make it in time.

27:42.577 --> 27:43.805
What's the story, Mackle?

27:47.315 --> 27:48.714
This is a real shame, Cabot.

27:55.523 --> 27:59.323
I always said that Special Intelligence
should have handled this whole operation.

28:06.801 --> 28:08.234
Double blackmail.

28:10.672 --> 28:14.005
Well, that cleans up things here.
You'll leave in the morning.

30:57.672 --> 31:00.300
-Are those your people?
-Yes.

31:00.508 --> 31:02.567
But things have changed.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.796
Rubali.

32:30.565 --> 32:32.260
Where's Rubali?

32:35.036 --> 32:36.025
Where am I?

32:38.640 --> 32:40.972
Where's the Princess Rubali?

32:41.442 --> 32:43.774
-What's going on?
-You'll get no answer.

32:43.945 --> 32:46.379
She has no tongue.

32:47.515 --> 32:51.975
-Who are you?
-Commander Zamir. Advisor to the Kahn.

32:55.790 --> 32:58.122
He has sent me here
to welcome you to our country.

33:00.294 --> 33:01.556
I already had that.

33:02.296 --> 33:05.163
-When do I meet the Kahn?
-Tomorrow.

33:05.333 --> 33:08.564
The Kahn will be presiding
over an explanation of the game.

33:08.736 --> 33:10.727
Afterwards, a banquet.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.305
The next day, you will play.

33:13.474 --> 33:15.374
That's what I'm here for.

33:16.511 --> 33:19.776
If there is anything I can do for you,
please ask.

33:21.382 --> 33:25.045
There is one thing.
The Princess Rubali, where is she?

33:25.520 --> 33:28.045
With her father, of course.

33:28.790 --> 33:32.248
And as I said, welcome.

33:33.227 --> 33:34.990
Thanks.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.061
No.

33:41.703 --> 33:43.830
Okay, okay.

33:51.145 --> 33:54.706
The first challenge is a three-mile
run across the swamp...

33:54.882 --> 33:59.285
...to the second obstacle,
a 200-foot rope climb.

33:59.454 --> 34:03.288
From there,
it is but a half mile to the gorge.

34:03.458 --> 34:07.417
The fourth part is to enter the river
that will lead you, dead or alive...

34:07.895 --> 34:09.418
...to the high forest.

34:09.597 --> 34:13.465
If successful, you will enter
the Village of the Damned.

34:13.634 --> 34:18.764
Surviving this, there is the final
five-mile run through the swamp again.

34:18.940 --> 34:21.966
It is not all at great risk...

34:22.143 --> 34:25.408
...it is also a test
of endurance, as you will see.

34:25.580 --> 34:29.880
And remember,
instinct must carry you as well.

34:30.551 --> 34:32.542
This is obvious here.

34:32.719 --> 34:36.281
But on land itself, it might be easy
to get lost. Take a wrong turn.

34:36.623 --> 34:39.058
There will be judges to show the way.

34:39.226 --> 34:40.922
There can be no mistakes.

34:41.094 --> 34:44.121
Anyone trying to avoid an obstacle
will be instantly killed.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.404
If you'll excuse me now, gentlemen...

34:52.873 --> 34:56.639
...I must go play king for my people.

35:14.162 --> 35:18.656
These men have been convicted
of grave crimes.

35:19.167 --> 35:23.160
But today, we will give them
a chance for life...

35:23.337 --> 35:26.670
...by letting them play the game!

35:33.948 --> 35:37.577
You have been shown the course
you will travel.

35:37.752 --> 35:41.153
When the rope is cut,
the prisoners will start running.

35:42.023 --> 35:48.326
Upon my command, the children
of Parmistan may begin their pursuit!

35:56.671 --> 35:57.729
Is Thorg gonna be here?

35:58.773 --> 36:01.139
Superman? I don't know,
I haven't seen him.

36:01.309 --> 36:02.503
Let's hope he makes it.

36:03.311 --> 36:05.905
I hear there's a town of crazies
we've gotta go through.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.206
Silence.

36:24.131 --> 36:26.565
Yes! Yes!

36:26.734 --> 36:28.634
Follow me.
We'll meet them at the swamp.

37:57.325 --> 37:58.917
Please. Please, help me.

37:59.093 --> 38:02.585
-Can't we help?
-Help me. Help me, please.

38:08.002 --> 38:10.664
-He'll be killed.
-And you will be too if you try to help.

38:54.348 --> 38:56.213
Kill him.

39:02.890 --> 39:04.323
Why did you do that?

39:05.259 --> 39:07.284
That warrior broke the rules.

39:07.461 --> 39:09.793
The prisoners were in
the next stage of the game.

39:09.964 --> 39:12.125
He should have waited
until they were above.

39:12.299 --> 39:13.391
We'll go there now.

39:56.944 --> 39:59.276
The warrior's in the same stage
as the prisoner.

39:59.447 --> 40:02.245
He can kill him if he can.

40:28.042 --> 40:30.977
Well, that didn't hold us
from the banquet very long.

42:39.406 --> 42:43.900
I would like to heartily welcome
all to my country...

42:44.078 --> 42:47.570
...and wish you great success
in the game tomorrow.

42:47.982 --> 42:51.110
You are all men of courage and skill.

42:51.285 --> 42:55.949
You've already shown that by surviving
the difficult journey into this country.

43:03.497 --> 43:04.486
Your Excellency?

43:06.033 --> 43:09.935
My father, Colonel Cabot,
he came here to play the game.

43:10.104 --> 43:11.503
What happened to him?

43:13.274 --> 43:16.903
Your father was a superb competitor.

43:17.077 --> 43:20.877
He would have belonged
at this table of champions tonight.

43:21.282 --> 43:23.910
But he was not victorious.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.018
Let us all wish his son good fortune.

43:39.500 --> 43:41.627
-Gomez?
-Yeah?

43:41.802 --> 43:44.168
You were telling me
about a town of crazies.

43:44.772 --> 43:47.070
This country sends
its criminally insane there.

43:47.241 --> 43:49.607
They've been doing it for generations.

43:51.679 --> 43:54.307
They're a bunch of goddamn cannibals.

43:54.481 --> 43:56.506
And you're stuffing
the turkey for them, huh?

44:03.057 --> 44:08.461
I would like to announce the wedding
of my daughter, the Princess Rubali.

44:13.434 --> 44:17.666
Which will take place tomorrow
following the game.

44:22.643 --> 44:28.445
My closest aide, Zamir,
is the lucky groom.

45:33.881 --> 45:35.906
Thorg?

45:39.420 --> 45:43.083
Forgive my tardiness, Great Kahn,
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.

45:43.557 --> 45:47.391
It is our honor to have you with us.
Please, sit down.

45:48.262 --> 45:52.198
Thorg. Jonathan Cabot.
I've admired you since Munich.

47:09.710 --> 47:13.578
You must understand, she's mine.

47:14.214 --> 47:15.704
It's not over yet.

47:15.883 --> 47:18.181
So put your hardware
back in your pants.

47:28.028 --> 47:30.929
You will take me to the Princess Rubali.

48:03.530 --> 48:05.828
Is this the princess's room?

48:11.238 --> 48:13.229
Don't be afraid.

48:13.407 --> 48:16.342
Tell the princess
to meet me in the garden.

48:29.022 --> 48:30.853
It's a political marriage.

48:31.024 --> 48:34.653
Traditionally, the daughter of the Kahn
marries his closest aide.

48:34.828 --> 48:36.489
Why can't he break with tradition?

48:37.431 --> 48:41.731
He has already earned a lot of enemy
for letting the twenties go unpunished.

48:42.135 --> 48:44.899
-The twenties?
-The young people.

48:45.072 --> 48:48.735
They want our country
to join the 20th century.

48:53.780 --> 48:56.840
It's funny, but this marriage...

48:57.017 --> 49:01.351
...which is supposed to help
unify our country, will tear it apart.

49:01.521 --> 49:02.579
Why?

49:03.156 --> 49:08.253
Zamir is the leader of the faction
trying to overthrow my father.

49:08.428 --> 49:11.090
But Father refuses to believe it.

49:11.598 --> 49:12.826
What's he gonna do?

49:13.533 --> 49:17.993
Father plans to announce a new era
for our country tomorrow, after the game.

49:18.171 --> 49:21.163
An era that combines
the best of the old and the new.

49:21.341 --> 49:23.002
That sounds intelligent.

49:23.176 --> 49:26.805
Yes, but Zamir will make sure
that tomorrow's game...

49:26.980 --> 49:31.815
...will be so deadly and so violent,
that no one will survive.

49:31.985 --> 49:33.282
That's not gonna happen.

49:33.453 --> 49:36.684
-Don't play tomorrow.
-I have to.

49:37.491 --> 49:38.958
You will get killed.

49:39.126 --> 49:40.423
Wouldn't I be killed anyway?

49:40.594 --> 49:43.392
Do you think they're just gonna allow me
to walk out of here?

49:43.563 --> 49:44.894
I'll win.

49:51.271 --> 49:52.602
Go.

50:03.517 --> 50:05.485
Stop!

51:23.997 --> 51:30.061
Children of Parmistan,
are you ready for the game?

51:44.251 --> 51:48.119
Today is a very special day.

51:48.722 --> 51:54.319
Not only will we play
the most important game in our history...

51:55.762 --> 51:59.459
...we will also have a royal wedding.

52:05.172 --> 52:07.231
Not while I'm alive.

52:08.809 --> 52:10.504
Yes.

52:10.811 --> 52:13.439
The princess was out last night.

52:14.247 --> 52:17.648
Someone else
was out on the grounds as well.

52:18.518 --> 52:20.884
Death becomes you.

52:35.435 --> 52:40.065
In the ancient tradition of Parmistan,
let the game begin!

52:55.055 --> 52:56.989
-Jonathan!
-Stop her!

53:15.575 --> 53:17.805
Zamir, stop!

53:17.978 --> 53:23.177
You are breaking the rules.
You must pursue on my command!

54:05.625 --> 54:07.149
Find him.

54:15.602 --> 54:17.433
I want him.

54:35.722 --> 54:37.656
Close the circle.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.128
There he is!

56:24.397 --> 56:25.659
The torch.

56:43.516 --> 56:46.076
Burn, you bastard.

57:05.538 --> 57:08.063
Damn it! The gorge!

57:19.853 --> 57:22.287
They broke the rules. Kill them.

57:24.791 --> 57:26.315
Damn it.

57:43.109 --> 57:44.770
Hurry!

59:39.959 --> 59:41.586
The sword.

59:47.634 --> 59:48.965
Hurry along, Cabot.

59:50.970 --> 59:53.996
You don't have a great deal of time.

01:01:25.998 --> 01:01:27.158
Damn!

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.831
The finish line for you
is right here, Cabot.

01:02:44.444 --> 01:02:46.503
Out of the way, Thorg.

01:03:05.364 --> 01:03:09.425
Hear the only sound of ax, cutting air.

01:03:54.046 --> 01:03:56.537
Gomez!

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:06.687
Here we are.

01:04:06.859 --> 01:04:08.156
The cuckoo's nest, eh?

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:13.793
Yeah, don't waste your breath.

01:04:30.516 --> 01:04:33.178
The village of the crazies.
He'll never get out alive.

01:07:39.572 --> 01:07:42.200
Oh, jeez.

01:08:12.905 --> 01:08:14.133
Gomez.

01:19:14.866 --> 01:19:17.494
Dad, my God.

01:19:18.236 --> 01:19:20.431
I knew you'd get here, Jonathan.

01:19:21.373 --> 01:19:22.897
I don't know what's real anymore.

01:19:23.074 --> 01:19:25.235
It's true enough,
it was a nightmare in hell.

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:28.208
Come on,
we can drop over the wall from here.

01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:29.937
Come on.

01:19:34.786 --> 01:19:36.947
The guards are still in the stairway.

01:19:37.122 --> 01:19:39.147
Protection.

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:41.221
Father, why don't you believe me?

01:19:41.393 --> 01:19:44.794
You saw what Zamir did.
He doesn't want anyone to win.

01:19:44.963 --> 01:19:47.056
He doesn't care
if they all kill one another.

01:19:47.232 --> 01:19:50.963
-It's all the same to him.
-I have always trusted him.

01:19:52.437 --> 01:19:54.337
You're a prisoner in your own palace.

01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.233
Not true.

01:19:57.409 --> 01:19:59.707
Why are you saying such things?

01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:02.005
He has built his own army.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.148
His, not yours.

01:20:04.316 --> 01:20:06.307
For security reasons, yes.

01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:08.885
And loyal to him, not to you.

01:20:09.955 --> 01:20:12.219
Father, look at them.

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:15.450
-Faces hidden from you.
-Well, that--

01:20:17.162 --> 01:20:19.255
The American is our only chance.

01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:22.059
I will help him in any way I can.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:25.431
Rubali, you must not do this.

01:21:00.572 --> 01:21:03.473
I was cut down trying to cross the gorge
on one of those ropes.

01:21:03.642 --> 01:21:06.975
Trees along the way broke my fall.
I got this useless arm out of it.

01:21:07.145 --> 01:21:12.481
Zamir's men captured me and were
gonna use me as diplomatic bait.

01:21:17.756 --> 01:21:19.121
I've missed you, Dad.

01:21:21.726 --> 01:21:23.216
It's so great to see you.

01:21:23.395 --> 01:21:25.454
You'll never know how--

01:21:33.505 --> 01:21:34.870
Win, Jonny.

01:21:51.556 --> 01:21:52.784
This is it.

01:21:52.958 --> 01:21:55.392
Ride. Ride!

01:22:55.787 --> 01:22:58.017
Jump, you fools.

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:55.545
Die, you bastard!

01:25:10.822 --> 01:25:12.847
Get out of my way.

01:25:19.397 --> 01:25:21.490
Traitor!

01:25:34.512 --> 01:25:35.945
Attention!

01:25:36.114 --> 01:25:38.082
Attention!

01:25:38.249 --> 01:25:40.149
Death to the Kahn!

01:25:46.858 --> 01:25:48.985
Seize them! Seize them!

01:25:50.795 --> 01:25:54.287
Zamir's men are traitors!

01:25:56.367 --> 01:26:00.326
Stop them! Stop them!

01:26:01.639 --> 01:26:03.630
They're here. They're here.

01:26:03.808 --> 01:26:06.709
Down the street. Hurry. Hurry!

01:26:17.522 --> 01:26:18.853
Over here. Over here.

01:26:19.023 --> 01:26:24.120
He's coming. Look. Over here.
Come on. Come on. He's coming.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:36.610
