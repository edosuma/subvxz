WEBVTT

00:16.642 --> 00:17.851
Who is it?

00:18.477 --> 00:19.728
It's Kangmu Lee.

00:54.471 --> 00:59.142
DR. BRAIN

01:05.732 --> 01:07.734
The night Junki died…

01:10.487 --> 01:13.115
I saw a car parked in front of his house.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.371
The police ran the license plate.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.166
And the car belonged…

01:25.294 --> 01:26.712
to you.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.718
And?

01:34.887 --> 01:36.722
You still don't trust me?

01:37.598 --> 01:40.017
I wasn't there.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.312
I guess you couldn't have been.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.105
Couldn't?

01:46.732 --> 01:48.942
Your car was completely destroyed.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.615
And you were found dead.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.077
You're saying…

02:00.245 --> 02:01.663
…I'm dead?

02:05.417 --> 02:07.419
Are you high?

02:12.883 --> 02:15.677
Something must have gone wrong
during the brain sync.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.062
Yeah, the brain sync.

02:27.272 --> 02:32.569
Perhaps you're here now
because you're part of Junki's memories.

02:35.489 --> 02:39.243
My determination to solve this case
extracted you from his memories.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.374
Since you're an investigator…

02:47.626 --> 02:49.795
…something in my subconscious
knew that you could be helpful.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.800
The man I'm looking at…

02:57.261 --> 02:58.971
…exists inside Junki's memories.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.556
Bullshit.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.308
That makes no sense at all.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.563
I exist inside Junki's memories?

03:11.984 --> 03:14.152
Just think about how things went down.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.823
Who did you meet first?

03:24.580 --> 03:25.873
I synced with you…

03:28.333 --> 03:30.127
before I synced with Junki.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.897
MORGUE
MEDICAL CENTER

03:49.980 --> 03:52.524
KANGMU LEE, MALE, AGE 46
ADMITTANCE: MARCH 13TH

04:14.213 --> 04:15.672
That's me?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.980
You were my first brain sync subject.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.235
But why can't I see your memories?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.948
Why do I see you
as a living person instead?

04:42.741 --> 04:46.161
Are you trying to tell me that
I've been absorbed by your brain?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.539
Since you were the first one

04:49.540 --> 04:51.750
perhaps some error occurred

04:54.002 --> 04:56.338
when your memories were
imprinted into my brain.

04:57.756 --> 05:00.551
Your memories,
your subconscious, all of it.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.888
You've been absorbed into my brain.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.934
That's why I perceive you
as an independent being.

05:17.609 --> 05:18.902
Then, what am I?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.241
A ghost?

05:32.791 --> 05:35.210
The person you are trying
to reach is not--

05:35.669 --> 05:37.462
What the hell is wrong with that guy?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.842
Do you think he's trying
to incriminate a dead guy?

05:42.593 --> 05:45.220
He's feeding us false information
to sabotage the investigation.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.515
And trying to show all of us
that he's pretty clever.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.186
-Then let's arrest him.
-For tampering with a corpse?

05:52.728 --> 05:55.647
-He'd beat that charge easily.
-We have Dr. Koh's location.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.566
OK, stay on him.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.860
Send a team to his house and to the lab.

05:59.943 --> 06:00.944
Yes, ma'am.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.538
So…

06:13.832 --> 06:16.460
Let's say all that's true.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.675
Let's say I'm dead and I'm a ghost.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.555
Don't you find it strange?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.893
Your first brain sync just happened to be

06:33.477 --> 06:36.313
with the private investigator
hired by your wife's boyfriend?

06:39.107 --> 06:39.942
Really?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.945
What are the odds?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.241
It's too much of a coincidence, no?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.119
How did that happen?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.581
Why was I your first one?

06:55.207 --> 06:59.503
Recently, we've seen very strong
interest for brain-inspired AI.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.798
That is, AI systems that are inspired

07:02.881 --> 07:06.176
by the structure and the functions
of the human brain.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.178
AI still has a long way to go

07:08.262 --> 07:09.263
DR. SEWON KOH

07:09.346 --> 07:10.848
when it comes to emulating curiosity

07:10.931 --> 07:13.559
social interaction, metacognition
and things of that nature.

07:13.642 --> 07:17.396
Our efforts are geared towards
imitating human brain functions…

07:17.479 --> 07:18.981
DR. SEWON KOH

07:19.064 --> 07:21.400
We want AI to be able
to produce its own emotions,

07:21.483 --> 07:25.112
read emotions from other agents,
and also be able to empathize.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.614
And so that's why this brain-inspired AI

07:27.698 --> 07:30.117
is the most important part
of our research…

07:32.619 --> 07:33.745
Hey, Sewon, I'm in a meeting--

07:33.829 --> 07:35.998
The first body
we used for the brain sync…

07:37.457 --> 07:38.834
Who was it?

07:40.794 --> 07:43.213
How the heck would I know?
What's this about?

07:43.297 --> 07:46.675
How did you get the body?

07:48.177 --> 07:51.597
What do you mean, how?
I just picked the first one I found.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.141
What's going on? Did something happen?

07:54.600 --> 07:55.601
I need to see you.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.899
I can't right now. Let's say 10 p.m.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.984
At the B Park Mall pizza place.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.694
Okay. See you later.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.493
I can't wait any longer.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.831
I have to find out what happened to me.

08:17.915 --> 08:18.749
Your accident…

08:22.794 --> 08:24.338
Do you remember anything?

08:25.756 --> 08:27.591
What's the last thing you remember?

08:30.886 --> 08:32.346
Where were you going?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.518
I was on my way to meet Junki.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.328
We're almost there.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.931
This is it.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.684
This is where your car crashed.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.870
What a shitty way to die.

09:42.291 --> 09:43.876
Maybe I slipped in the rain?

09:45.002 --> 09:45.919
No…

09:47.045 --> 09:48.672
I saw something else.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.424
Let's go take a look.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.288
There were so many things I wanted to do.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.709
I didn't get to say goodbye to my father.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.091
What?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.312
You're driving somewhere.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.981
-But…
-But what?

10:50.442 --> 10:51.902
Yes, I'm on my way.

10:56.949 --> 10:57.950
Wait…

10:59.117 --> 11:00.744
I'm being followed.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.207
Let me call you back.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.487
Someone was tailing you.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.615
I remember.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.743
I thought I threw them off.

12:23.202 --> 12:25.746
But you didn't lose them.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.664
They came back for you.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.157
What's wrong?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.545
It wasn't an accident.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.588
What?

13:17.005 --> 13:18.757
You were murdered.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.390
Did you see the killer's face?

14:06.054 --> 14:07.347
Is he still alive?

14:09.141 --> 14:13.020
Why are you digging for info
on Jaeyi Jung?

14:15.105 --> 14:16.440
Who sent you?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.486
He's in bad shape.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
He saw our faces.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.626
Out of the way!

14:40.881 --> 14:42.341
Why was I killed?

14:43.091 --> 14:45.302
They were after the man who hired you.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.224
Junki Lim?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.435
They killed everyone.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.609
I think Dr. Hong
can help us figure this out.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.414
Going somewhere?

15:56.123 --> 15:59.960
Yeah, I'm going home.
I'm tired. I've been working overtime.

16:00.711 --> 16:05.257
Did you notice anything odd about Dr. Koh?

16:06.592 --> 16:08.677
Well, Dr. Koh's a weirdo,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.388
so you'd have to be more specific.

16:15.767 --> 16:16.977
Fair enough.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.647
Also, Secretary Yoon wants to see you.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.067
Secretary Yoon? For what?

16:24.151 --> 16:27.613
He's pretty concerned
about your recent activities.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.032
He'll reach out to you.

16:31.617 --> 16:32.826
I understand.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.372
Yes?

17:20.790 --> 17:21.625
Got it.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.671
Turn around.
Dr. Koh is heading towards Yongsan.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.257
-Alpha Romeo B9, requesting backup.
-Ah shit…

18:20.851 --> 18:21.852
Anything?

18:22.436 --> 18:24.062
His phone's off.

18:34.990 --> 18:35.991
What?

18:36.992 --> 18:38.994
I think that's the man who killed you.

18:39.494 --> 18:40.787
No, wait…

18:42.956 --> 18:44.166
I'll go.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.407
Dr. Sewon Koh.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.247
Come with us quietly.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.124
Quietly.

19:30.462 --> 19:31.797
Hey, hey, hey…

19:33.006 --> 19:35.342
That's no way to treat a doctor, right?

19:46.728 --> 19:49.439
Put that away. This isn't a war.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.317
You come with me.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.037
-Upstairs.
-All right.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.590
Most people think
that in a situation like this

20:15.174 --> 20:17.050
they can just run away.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.387
But it's not that easy.

20:21.305 --> 20:22.472
Think about it.

20:24.099 --> 20:27.269
You never know,
you might just get stabbed in the ribs.

20:28.812 --> 20:33.567
Or you might just get stabbed in the back
when you're not even looking.

20:34.276 --> 20:37.112
Imagine I cut your face or your neck.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.780
You wouldn't make a sound.

20:41.533 --> 20:42.367
For real.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.708
Don't let them take you
or you'll end up like me.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.849
Move!

21:23.242 --> 21:25.035
Son of a bitch.

21:27.829 --> 21:31.500
Dr. Koh, what will you do now?

21:32.084 --> 21:34.503
Why is it that you stupid bastards

21:35.295 --> 21:39.758
never, ever, listen?

21:53.939 --> 21:55.566
Oh, shit.

21:58.777 --> 21:59.653
Don't shoot!

22:06.785 --> 22:07.870
Shit!

22:18.672 --> 22:19.923
What the fuck…?

22:36.398 --> 22:40.736
Dr. Koh, you should probably run now.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.374
Don't move!

23:06.637 --> 23:07.638
Get back inside!

23:18.649 --> 23:20.108
Shit…

23:27.115 --> 23:28.200
Stay here!

23:40.462 --> 23:42.172
Doyoon, where is he?

23:42.756 --> 23:44.174
Where is my son?

23:50.556 --> 23:52.933
Second floor! Second floor!

23:53.475 --> 23:54.768
Coming through!

24:16.957 --> 24:18.792
-Stop!
-Downstairs!

24:19.877 --> 24:21.295
Out of my way!

24:42.608 --> 24:43.734
Start talking.

24:44.776 --> 24:47.404
Who the hell is that? And the other guy?

24:47.487 --> 24:48.947
I need to know why
they're trying to hurt you.

24:49.907 --> 24:51.325
I have no idea.

24:52.034 --> 24:53.869
The answer is in his memories.

24:55.287 --> 24:57.581
I have to do a brain sync with him
before it's too late.

24:59.082 --> 25:01.210
Lieutenant, we lost him.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.754
We're checking cameras
with the help of the guards.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.839
We have to get him to the lab immediately.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.342
I'll explain everything later.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.802
Do you think this is some kind of joke?

25:11.553 --> 25:12.971
Tell me what's going on!

25:18.352 --> 25:21.563
If I'm lying,
and brain syncs are impossible

25:22.189 --> 25:25.067
how can I know things
before you know them?

25:27.402 --> 25:29.404
What are the things we don't know?

25:30.906 --> 25:32.908
Those men killed Kangmu Lee.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.870
Kangmu died in a car accident.

25:36.954 --> 25:39.623
Junki Lim hired Kangmu
to investigate something.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.918
Whatever it was,
those guys didn't like it.

25:43.001 --> 25:45.629
And that's why they murdered Kangmu.

25:46.088 --> 25:48.966
If I'm right,
it's the same men who killed Junki,

25:49.049 --> 25:50.884
and kidnapped his kid.

25:53.470 --> 25:55.931
Ask her what forensics said
about Junki's murder.

25:57.266 --> 26:00.352
She might know something
about the way I died.

26:00.978 --> 26:03.188
-That's not important right now.
-Then what is?

26:04.565 --> 26:06.775
Find the killers
and you find out everything.

26:06.859 --> 26:09.236
Syncing with the man who just died
would be a lot faster.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.196
Asking her is a lot faster. Just do it!

26:14.241 --> 26:16.952
It's pretty obvious that
what you need is psychiatric help.

26:17.536 --> 26:19.371
Not to sync with another brain.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.831
I'm not crazy.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.083
Then maybe you're lying
to sabotage the case.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.003
Prove you're not lying to me.

26:26.461 --> 26:29.423
But not your way. You do it our way.

26:45.814 --> 26:48.192
My name is Dohyung Kim.
I'm here to take your polygraph.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.986
I'm going to ask you
a few questions today.

26:51.737 --> 26:53.530
Just answer yes or no.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.534
Is your name Sewon Koh?

26:58.869 --> 26:59.745
Yes.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.372
Is your wife Jaeyi Jung?

27:04.249 --> 27:05.250
Yes.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.504
Have you ever tried to kill your wife?

27:10.797 --> 27:11.632
What?

27:12.341 --> 27:15.427
You can only answer yes or no.

27:16.887 --> 27:17.888
No.

27:24.019 --> 27:27.356
Do you know Junki Lim?
And have you ever met him?

27:28.565 --> 27:29.441
No.

27:30.901 --> 27:31.944
JUNKI LIM, MALE, AGE 38

27:43.747 --> 27:45.791
Ask him if he killed Junki Lim.

27:48.919 --> 27:51.463
Did you kill Junki Lim?

27:53.841 --> 27:54.925
No.

27:57.886 --> 27:59.471
Ask him about Kangmu Lee.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.140
And Kangmu Lee? Do you know him?

28:03.058 --> 28:06.270
This really isn't going well for you.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.233
That polygraph is looking pretty bad.

28:16.822 --> 28:18.532
I know him, but--

28:18.615 --> 28:20.242
Yes or no.

28:22.828 --> 28:24.788
It's just not that simple.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.380
Ask about the relationship
between Junki and Jaeyi.

28:33.463 --> 28:38.552
And did you know Junki and your wife
were a little more than just friends?

28:44.266 --> 28:45.267
No.

28:45.809 --> 28:49.313
Were you worried that
your spouse might one day leave you

28:49.396 --> 28:50.480
to be with Junki?

28:54.610 --> 28:59.823
Were you angry, or even furious,
because of your wife's affair?

29:02.326 --> 29:03.327
Answer the question.

29:08.707 --> 29:09.541
Enough, please.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.464
I won't answer any more questions.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.022
That polygraph means absolutely nothing.

29:32.606 --> 29:35.275
It was my nervous system reacting
to someone else's memories.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.277
I can prove it to you.

29:37.903 --> 29:39.530
Let me do the brain sync.

29:39.613 --> 29:42.824
You're in no position to make any demands.

29:44.243 --> 29:46.787
I don't think
you understand the situation.

29:47.371 --> 29:49.540
It's you who don't understand.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.960
Do you not want to find the girl?

29:54.962 --> 29:56.588
We're running out of time.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.591
You're right.

30:00.384 --> 30:01.760
We're done here.

30:30.497 --> 30:31.540
Who is it?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.294
Mom, it's me, your son.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.088
I didn't mean to scare you.

30:38.172 --> 30:40.382
Why did you sneak in through the window?

30:40.465 --> 30:42.259
Someone must be watching the door.

30:42.342 --> 30:45.220
-What are you talking about? Who is?
-Mom, listen…

30:45.304 --> 30:47.848
What's going on? What's wrong with you?

30:48.599 --> 30:50.017
I'll tell you later.

30:51.226 --> 30:55.522
Mom, I'm sorry, but could I borrow
your credit card and your car?

31:05.699 --> 31:06.909
Seungchae!

31:08.410 --> 31:11.496
Oh, my girl! Come here.

31:11.914 --> 31:15.125
-Did you go to day care?
-Yeah, I played with Eunha today.

31:15.209 --> 31:17.794
Oh yeah? That's so awesome!

31:17.878 --> 31:19.880
It's you who don't understand!

31:21.590 --> 31:23.258
Do you not want to find the girl?

31:23.342 --> 31:25.135
-Did you eat?
-Yeah, I did.

31:25.219 --> 31:27.721
-Here's your jacket.
-Oh, thanks.

31:27.804 --> 31:31.642
-Are you happy to see Daddy?
-Really? Give me a kiss.

31:50.369 --> 31:51.578
Tell me.

31:52.829 --> 31:55.457
Why are you so set on finding that girl?

31:56.083 --> 31:57.501
Heejin said

31:59.086 --> 32:00.838
she saw my son alive.

32:05.175 --> 32:06.760
I have to find her.

32:07.553 --> 32:09.221
I beg you.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.410
Mind waiting outside?

32:32.953 --> 32:35.539
I'm not leaving a suspect unattended.
Please keep going.

33:57.579 --> 33:58.997
MINA

34:04.211 --> 34:05.295
Yeah.

34:08.172 --> 34:11.385
I have a job today
and I'm gonna have to be out all night.

34:14.554 --> 34:16.764
Yeah, babe, I miss you a lot too.

34:17.349 --> 34:18.976
Of course, every day.

34:19.059 --> 34:20.643
I have to go. I'll call you later.

34:37.703 --> 34:41.498
Get your stuff and get over there.
Call me if you run into trouble.

34:57.306 --> 34:59.766
Damn it, I think he knows we're onto him.

35:00.267 --> 35:02.060
I told you not to get too close!

35:03.604 --> 35:04.938
What the hell…?

35:27.002 --> 35:30.255
Why are you investigating Jaeyi Jung?

35:31.173 --> 35:32.174
Who sent you?

35:46.063 --> 35:47.272
Go start the car.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.379
Come on, let's get out of here.

36:36.321 --> 36:39.283
We took care of that investigator
who was poking around.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.035
And we also got rid of the man
who hired him.

36:42.744 --> 36:44.246
Oh, him?

36:46.373 --> 36:47.875
He has a daughter.

36:49.001 --> 36:51.253
She's quite extraordinary.

36:53.005 --> 36:56.300
She can draw anything she's seen.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.844
Yeah, don't worry about her.

36:58.927 --> 37:01.221
She didn't see us. She wasn't even there.

37:03.557 --> 37:04.808
You sure about that?

37:05.475 --> 37:06.685
Yeah, absolutely.

37:20.407 --> 37:21.742
Take care of her.

37:33.670 --> 37:36.340
-Did you see the girl?
-I didn't see anything.

37:37.841 --> 37:38.800
You looked everywhere?

37:42.971 --> 37:44.473
You fucking idiot.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.873
Stop right here.

38:10.249 --> 38:11.834
Report back when you're done.

38:14.253 --> 38:17.005
Bury all three where they can't be found.

38:18.090 --> 38:21.593
And don't cause any more problems.

38:56.712 --> 38:57.713
Shit…

39:05.596 --> 39:06.847
What do I do?

39:08.515 --> 39:11.768
Shit, shit, shit! Fuck me!

39:14.813 --> 39:17.608
I told him I don't do kids, goddamn it!

39:17.691 --> 39:19.109
Fucking asshole!

39:55.479 --> 39:56.855
GORYEO TEAHOUSE

40:20.921 --> 40:22.381
Ah, shit.

40:22.881 --> 40:25.384
What am I supposed to do with her?

40:25.467 --> 40:30.097
Just keep her for two days
until I figure out what to do next.

40:30.681 --> 40:33.767
You know I fucking hate kids!

40:35.727 --> 40:37.187
Don't tell me she's yours!

40:37.271 --> 40:39.565
Of course not. She looks nothing like me.

40:47.489 --> 40:50.033
Okay. I'm giving you exactly 48 hours.

40:50.409 --> 40:51.827
And not a minute longer.

40:55.455 --> 40:56.748
Should we blindfold her?

40:59.918 --> 41:01.295
You blindfold her.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.464
Can't believe you're making me do this.

41:04.882 --> 41:05.841
Jeez…

41:14.850 --> 41:15.851
Heejin is still alive.

41:17.978 --> 41:18.979
What?

41:21.356 --> 41:22.774
We have to hurry.

41:23.942 --> 41:26.612
I think he left her with his girlfriend.

41:27.362 --> 41:28.322
Who did?

41:29.406 --> 41:30.699
This dead guy?

41:32.034 --> 41:32.910
Teahouse.

41:34.036 --> 41:35.454
She's at a teahouse.

41:36.205 --> 41:37.247
A teahouse?

41:37.998 --> 41:39.249
I think I can find it.

41:54.097 --> 41:55.599
Yeah, it's around here.

41:58.435 --> 42:00.604
Is this the only way to do this?

42:00.687 --> 42:02.940
How many times
do we have to go around in circles?

42:04.399 --> 42:05.776
Just shut up.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.110
Yes, ma'am.

42:15.994 --> 42:19.248
JINNAM-SI
HAENGWU-MYEON

42:24.294 --> 42:25.337
What do I do?

42:26.129 --> 42:27.130
Where do I go?

42:27.881 --> 42:30.884
Shit! I'm so fucked.

42:37.766 --> 42:39.810
MINA

42:46.149 --> 42:47.150
Mina…

42:47.234 --> 42:48.861
JINNAM-SI 16KM
HAENGWU-MYEON 10KM

42:50.195 --> 42:51.196
Mina.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.240
JINNAM-SI - HAENGWU-MYEON

42:54.658 --> 42:55.576
Take this exit.

43:19.016 --> 43:21.560
GORYEO TEAHOUSE

43:34.531 --> 43:36.533
-See if there's a back door.
-Yes, ma'am.

43:38.660 --> 43:39.870
Come on in!

43:42.623 --> 43:44.333
We're looking for someone.

43:44.750 --> 43:45.626
Who?

43:45.709 --> 43:46.919
Her name's Mina.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.303
Girls don't work here for very long.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.891
I don't know a Mina,
if that's even her real name.

44:08.273 --> 44:10.192
Hey, wait! Where are you going?

44:14.154 --> 44:16.281
No, don't talk to them. Talk to me.

44:17.074 --> 44:19.993
Hello, ladies. I'll need to see some IDs.

44:20.077 --> 44:21.161
Please, let's talk about this!

44:21.995 --> 44:25.749
You run a prostitution business,
you have sanitary violations…

44:27.417 --> 44:29.253
and you're selling alcohol
without a license.

44:30.003 --> 44:31.296
I would talk if I were you.

44:31.380 --> 44:33.924
Mina. What was her last name?

44:34.007 --> 44:35.217
It's Mina Song.

44:39.429 --> 44:40.639
Where can I find her?

44:44.101 --> 44:45.394
Damn it.

44:46.937 --> 44:48.939
Ah, shit…

44:52.609 --> 44:54.361
It's me! I'm back!

45:04.121 --> 45:05.747
Tell us where the girl is.

45:06.164 --> 45:08.667
We know your boyfriend,
Taegu Lee, left her with you.

45:14.756 --> 45:16.675
What the hell are you talking about?

45:17.593 --> 45:19.887
I haven't seen that dummy in ages.

45:21.471 --> 45:22.973
You won't see him again.

45:23.390 --> 45:25.809
He was killed at a crime scene.

45:26.435 --> 45:27.644
What did you say?

45:29.479 --> 45:30.772
What happened to him?

45:31.440 --> 45:34.234
He was involved in a serious crime
and was shot to death.

45:35.819 --> 45:39.531
If you don't want to be treated
as his accomplice and end up in prison,

45:40.282 --> 45:41.992
I strongly recommend you come clean.

45:43.911 --> 45:46.455
What are you talking about?

45:46.538 --> 45:49.374
Who died? Why are you talking nonsense?

45:49.458 --> 45:53.253
Where's Heejin?

45:55.088 --> 45:56.465
Oh, shit…

45:57.883 --> 46:00.219
Shit! Shit!

46:02.346 --> 46:03.889
-Arrest her.
-No, wait!

46:05.057 --> 46:08.560
Taegu left her at my apartment
and never came back.

46:08.644 --> 46:12.189
That girl was kind of weird,
and Taegu never showed up or called back.

46:12.272 --> 46:14.107
While I was briefly gone,

46:14.608 --> 46:16.026
she just ran away.

46:16.109 --> 46:18.445
What was I supposed to do?

46:18.529 --> 46:21.031
Honestly,
I didn't have to go look for her!

46:23.033 --> 46:24.576
I'm telling you the truth!

46:24.993 --> 46:27.037
If you don't believe me,
let's go to my place.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.664
Come on, let's go!

46:36.463 --> 46:38.340
She's not here. There's no trace of her.

46:38.423 --> 46:41.718
See? I told you she wasn't here.

46:42.261 --> 46:44.179
Do you have memories of this place?

46:44.263 --> 46:46.682
No, not this place.

46:46.765 --> 46:49.309
What's this about?
Why the hell would he ever come here?

47:48.827 --> 47:50.495
Too much time has passed.

47:52.039 --> 47:53.582
It's going to get dark soon.

47:54.416 --> 47:58.170
Actually, darkness could work
to our advantage.

49:19.126 --> 49:20.294
Stop!

49:49.031 --> 49:49.907
Whoa!

50:20.979 --> 50:21.813
Heejin.

50:46.755 --> 50:48.382
Let me go alone.

51:38.390 --> 51:39.266
Heejin.

51:42.644 --> 51:44.354
I'm Doyoon's dad.

51:54.156 --> 51:55.365
Are you okay?

52:13.258 --> 52:16.011
He found her! Someone call an ambulance!

52:16.094 --> 52:17.513
Hurry!

52:23.894 --> 52:25.312
I'll take her. Let's go.

53:02.516 --> 53:05.561
WONIL GENERAL HOSPITAL

53:26.874 --> 53:28.292
She won't speak.

53:28.709 --> 53:30.961
She won't answer any of our questions.

53:33.213 --> 53:34.798
Heejin is very special.

53:35.591 --> 53:37.509
I know about special children.

53:38.719 --> 53:39.928
She's like Doyoon…

53:43.223 --> 53:44.850
…and me when I was a kid.

53:50.480 --> 53:54.443
Can I please try to talk to her for bit?

54:11.293 --> 54:12.461
Heejin.

54:21.803 --> 54:24.264
I know you're friends with Doyoon.

54:27.267 --> 54:29.228
And that you took care of Mika.

54:32.022 --> 54:33.440
And I also know that

54:35.484 --> 54:37.486
you're very good at drawing.

54:44.576 --> 54:45.869
I have…

54:50.165 --> 54:52.417
something very important I need to ask.

54:54.837 --> 54:56.046
It's about Doyoon.

55:00.551 --> 55:02.761
Where did you last see Doyoon?

55:05.180 --> 55:07.182
Can you please tell me?

55:19.069 --> 55:21.989
Or can you draw something for me?
