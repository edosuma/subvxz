00:02.719 --> 00:04.233
Hey, Ma.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.029
Hey, you guys...

00:06.240 --> 00:09.118
...I think we haven't been paying
enough attention to Lucky.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.278
Who's Lucky?

00:12.160 --> 00:14.594
Any guy who goes out on a date
with Kelly.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.517
Well, hasn't anyone else noticed
that he seems kind of depressed?

00:22.720 --> 00:24.950
Well, what makes you think
something like that?

01:03.760 --> 01:05.352
- Now, easy. Easy now.
- I'm going, I'm-

01:05.560 --> 01:07.437
- Watch it.
- We're gonna have so much fun...

01:07.640 --> 01:08.914
...with this damn thing, Bud.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.313
Watch it. You're gonna nick
the side of the box.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.988
You are never gonna get
that big, stupid thing in here.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.397
That's what I said when I carried you
over the threshold.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.672
Hi, neighbours. Look, we brought you
some things to munch-

01:24.800 --> 01:28.076
- Hey. Hey.
- Watch it. I'll kill you for that!

01:30.960 --> 01:33.599
Told you we should've used
the feed pole.

01:34.520 --> 01:37.557
Well, enjoy. And there's plenty more
where that came from.

01:37.760 --> 01:42.117
All you have to do is stay inside
the entire weekend, okay?

01:42.320 --> 01:43.912
Why?

01:45.600 --> 01:48.717
Well, my cousin Mandy
is coming for a visit.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.751
And how can I put this nicely?

01:50.960 --> 01:53.679
I don't want her
to be repulsed by you.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.549
You know, not that you're repulsive.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.317
Enough said.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.068
But, you know, it's been years
since I've seen Mandy...

02:10.280 --> 02:11.952
...and we were once very close.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.276
In fact, we're identical.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.392
So she's as obnoxious as you?

02:17.960 --> 02:20.713
Identical cousins.
There's no such thing.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.512
Well, sure there is.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.996
Samantha and Serena,
Patty and Cathy.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.269
Exactly.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.031
<i>We walk alik e, we talk alik e
Sometimes we even something alik e</i>

02:33.240 --> 02:36.471
So there's another one out there
exactly like you?

02:37.080 --> 02:39.071
Well, not exactly.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.316
I am a little prettier.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.795
If she's the pretty one,
imagine what the cousin looks like.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.119
Do you see I'm trying to eat here?

02:50.680 --> 02:52.796
Watch it now. Watch it now. Watch it.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.390
He fakes, he shoots, he scores!
I win again.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.955
Relax, Dad. It's just foosball.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.991
Just foosball, son?

03:01.200 --> 03:03.873
This is the greatest invention
ever made.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.391
Edward Foos
was a boy with a dream.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.560
A dream to invent a game
that everyone can enjoy...

03:10.760 --> 03:13.320
...no matter how out of shape
or drunk you are.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.035
The boy's not right, Peg.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.556
I knew that the day we dropped him
on his head and he didn't scream.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.118
- Hi, I'm Man-
- Nice wig, Marce.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.993
Hey, Peg, look here. The fifth Beatle.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.389
I'm not Marcy.
I'm Mandy, Marcy's cousin.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.392
You and Marcy
really do look alike.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.670
You think so?
I know I'm no supermodel...

03:48.880 --> 03:51.553
...but I never really thought
I looked like a chicken.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.079
I like her.

03:54.520 --> 03:57.273
Marcy and Jefferson
went to meet you at the airport.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.711
Well, my flight was early,
so I took a cab.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.071
- You mind if I wait here?
- No, not at all. Not at all.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.191
Of course, here in the Windy City...

04:05.400 --> 04:09.393
...it's customary to tip people
who let you into their home.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.956
You must be Al.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.629
Sadly, he must.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.827
Hey, foosball. You any good?

04:19.079 --> 04:21.514
Is your cousin flat-chested?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.592
Oh, score!

04:24.800 --> 04:25.949
I'm ahead.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.675
Lucky shot. That was a lucky shot.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.072
- Now can I play?
- Not now, Peg.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.635
Score! I win.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.555
We couldn't find my cousin at-

04:37.920 --> 04:40.992
- Mandy!
- Marcy!

04:46.880 --> 04:51.271
- You look great.
- So do you.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.874
What are you doing here?

04:53.640 --> 04:55.039
We didn't go out. She came in.

04:55.240 --> 04:58.789
Which reminds me, we're-
We're out of onion dip.

04:59.200 --> 05:04.194
Mandy, this is my Jefferson.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.633
Don't you wish you had one
just like him?

05:07.840 --> 05:10.673
You mean
there's another one of him too?

05:11.680 --> 05:14.478
Wow, you're even better looking
than Marcy said.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.079
Oh, so are you.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.428
Honey, why did you say
you were the pretty one?

05:23.320 --> 05:26.551
Come on now.
We're right in the middle of a game.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.112
Marcy...

05:29.560 --> 05:33.951
...if you guys are identical,
how come she has...?

05:34.160 --> 05:35.798
Implants.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.279
Really?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.192
Not that I like...

05:42.440 --> 05:44.032
...big, luscious breasts.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.678
They just get in the way.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.350
Those pills the vet gave Lucky
really have pepped him up.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.990
Don't you think
that he's a little bit too hyper?

06:02.120 --> 06:05.908
No. No, he's fine.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.350
Hey, he's burying a bone.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.272
You know, we should give
some of those pills to Mom.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.950
I did. How do you think
she got off the couch?

06:23.840 --> 06:26.479
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi, Peggy.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.432
I got your bonbons.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.794
Guess what. I am making Jefferson
his favourite supper tonight.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.675
- Why?
- Because if a wife doesn't do it...

06:37.880 --> 06:41.156
...then some other woman might
come along and steal him away.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.909
Even someone you least expect,
you know, like a cousin.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.631
You know, a cousin that all the boys
like best because she's such fun.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.877
Boys like Jimmy Miller, who showed
Mandy his baseball cards...

06:53.080 --> 06:56.038
...and played keep away
with little Marcy's undershirt.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.678
Marcy, I'm really worried.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.509
Maybe we shouldn't have let Mandy
spend the day with Al and Jefferson.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.228
Why, Peggy Bundy.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.432
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were jealous.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.599
What a game.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.917
- What was the final score?
- Thirty-seven to 14.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.190
That doesn't sound
like a baseball score.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.198
It's not. That's how many beers
and hot dogs we had...

07:19.400 --> 07:22.073
...before we decided
to pants Jefferson.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.189
Yeah, you kidders.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.949
Luckily, it was Souvenir Towel Day
at the ballpark.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.594
Hey, Marce, got you a T-shirt.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.276
- Keep away!
- Keep away from Marcy!

07:38.040 --> 07:39.917
Mandy! Mandy! Mandy!

07:40.120 --> 07:42.793
- Mandy! Mandy!
- Mandy! Mandy!

07:43.000 --> 07:46.072
You guys are so immature!

07:46.280 --> 07:48.669
Give it back or I'm telling.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.271
Hey, look what Jefferson gave me.
He caught a foul ball.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.109
Well, actually, it was a home-run ball,
but, you know, no big deal.

08:01.320 --> 08:04.995
He's been trying to catch one
of those his whole life. Excuse me.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.758
Al, new deal.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.033
How would you like
a nice juicy pot roast for supper?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.639
With those little potatoes?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.513
And biscuits and gravy...

08:15.720 --> 08:16.675
What do I gotta do?

08:16.880 --> 08:19.872
All you have to do
is keep Mandy away from Jefferson...

08:20.080 --> 08:21.718
...until she leaves tomorrow.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.875
I can do that.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.719
Mandy, you wanna stay
for dinner tonight?

08:25.920 --> 08:28.957
Jefferson and I need a little
alone time. Come on, honey.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.072
Wait, you know, I think I'll just stay
and hang out with Mandy.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.270
Or I could come now.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.075
Hey, Peg...

08:37.280 --> 08:40.750
...how would you like a pot roast
dinner tonight with all the fixings?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.190
- Where are we going?
- The kitchen.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.356
I'm not cooking.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.754
I'll do it. I love to cook.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.957
Why can't you be
more like Mandy, Peg?

08:51.160 --> 08:52.673
She likes foosball, baseball...

08:52.880 --> 08:55.235
...she likes to cook.
She's just like a wife...

08:55.440 --> 08:57.112
...but fun.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.191
So marry her.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.279
How about it, Mandy?

09:05.480 --> 09:07.277
<i>Me and you in Vegas...</i>

09:07.480 --> 09:10.392
...a honeymoon
at football fantasy camp.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.156
- It sounds fun, Al, but I'm involved.
- Yeah?

09:14.840 --> 09:18.071
- Who's the lucky guy?
- Barbara.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.155
Barbara?

09:20.360 --> 09:24.319
Well, that sounds like he might
be a little light in the loafers, huh?

09:24.720 --> 09:28.110
Well, actually, she's a little heavy
in the construction boots.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.673
She?

09:29.880 --> 09:32.519
Yes. Al, I'm gay.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.312
Gay?

09:41.600 --> 09:44.433
I can see that you're shocked, Al.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.074
Why do you think I went with you
to the Jiggly Room?

09:47.280 --> 09:49.748
I thought you were being
a good sport.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.110
Why do you think I was blowing kisses
to all the strippers?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.276
I thought you were aiming at me
and missing.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.678
Did any of them kiss back?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.197
But not Lolla, huh?

10:03.840 --> 10:05.671
Of course not. Lolla's a guy.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.236
- What? What?
- Calm down, Al.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.317
That can't be.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.430
How did a thing like this
happen to you?

10:15.640 --> 10:17.870
What, did you get stood up
for the prom...

10:18.080 --> 10:20.196
...or you went to prison?

10:20.800 --> 10:23.268
I know. It was
summer camp, wasn't it?

10:23.480 --> 10:25.596
You sprained
a muscle skinny-dipping...

10:25.800 --> 10:27.631
...and the beautiful,
blond counsellor-

10:27.840 --> 10:29.831
Let's call her Betty.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.119
- carried you back to her cabin
and gave you a massage.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.673
And before you knew it...

10:34.880 --> 10:39.317
...you were a love slave
in an all-girl sex cult.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.996
Yeah, that's what happened.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.075
You saw that in a video,
didn't you, Al?

10:47.280 --> 10:50.556
Yeah. My favourite.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.878
Mine too.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.313
So you don't have a problem
with two women being together?

10:58.520 --> 11:00.272
No.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.074
As long as there's a guy watching.

11:07.920 --> 11:13.119
Well, I've told everyone in the family
except for Marcy.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.594
- How do you think she's gonna take it?
- Are you crazy?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.950
She's done a lot weirder sex stuff
than that.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.913
I shouldn't be surprised.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.588
She used to have to pay boys
to kiss her.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.756
She still does.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.391
So, Al, has your little friend
finally gone home...

11:33.600 --> 11:35.192
...or do you want her to sleep over?

11:35.400 --> 11:38.949
Peg, you don't have to worry
about Mandy.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.754
Why? Because you only
have eyes for me?

11:41.960 --> 11:43.837
No.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.712
No, Peg...

11:46.640 --> 11:48.153
...Mandy's gay.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.318
- She is?
- Yes, Peg.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.718
I'm surprised you couldn't pick it up.
I never miss a thing like that.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.911
Gaydar.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.988
Good thing the vet took Lucky
off those puppy uppers.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.988
Yesterday he was chasing cars
and passing them.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.877
Well, the vet said that the pills
were just masking his pain.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.116
I think he's depressed
because he's lonely.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.517
So I set up this little date for him.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.229
Kelly, only an idiot
would help a dog to date.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.272
I'm Bud.
I'll be your waiter this evening.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.831
Hey, Elaine. Hey, Frisky.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.759
Frisky, that's Lucky.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.838
And this is loser.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.194
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.231
Bye, Kelly.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.558
So Frisky and Lucky.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.033
Let's hope
that also describes their owners.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.035
I can't believe
you went to so much trouble.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.232
I love that you love your dog
this much.

13:05.440 --> 13:10.275
We want to do whatever it takes
to get our furry little friends together.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.991
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be more gentle.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.875
That wasn't me.
No, I don't make that noise until later.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.796
Lucky, be nice. She's company.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.197
Your dog doesn't like my dog
very much.

13:57.400 --> 14:00.437
Sure he does.
He's just playing hard to get.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.554
Okay, so she's not your type.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.389
Can't you just close your eyes
and pretend she's Lassie?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.511
It's worked for me.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.638
I can't believe how rude your dog is.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.798
Me neither. I'll have him put to sleep.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.110
We'll just play with your dog.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.869
I have a better idea.
Why don't you play with yourself?

14:46.840 --> 14:51.391
- Al, get the door.
- I'm trying to, Peg.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.471
Well, so much for honesty.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.238
What, she kicked you out?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.477
Well, not right away.
First she started screaming...

15:00.680 --> 15:03.478
...and babbling something
about an undershirt.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.275
I hate to impose,
but can I crash on your couch?

15:06.480 --> 15:09.438
Well, that depends.
Won't turn it gay, will it?

15:10.720 --> 15:13.439
- No, I don't think so, Al.
- Just checking.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.108
Well, I better get on upstairs.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.395
I trust you're enough of a lady
not to whistle...

15:20.600 --> 15:23.194
...at my tight little behind
as I go up the stairs.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.598
- Al, I told you, I'm gay.
- That may well be...

15:26.800 --> 15:29.712
...but there are some things
no woman can resist.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.555
Hey, Mandy, I have a question.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.513
Do you just like certain women?

15:44.720 --> 15:46.870
Or would you sleep
with any woman on Earth...

15:47.080 --> 15:49.116
...before you'd sleep with a man?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.755
Well, it depends.
Give me a "for instance. "

15:52.280 --> 15:54.032
For instance...

15:55.000 --> 15:56.877
...you're on a desert island.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.435
Who would you rather be with,
me or Cindy Crawford?

15:59.640 --> 16:00.755
Cindy.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.958
Me...

16:04.520 --> 16:07.318
- ... or Phyllis Diller?
- Phyllis.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.398
Me...

16:10.600 --> 16:13.194
...or Marge Schott?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.675
You. But the whole time
we'd be doing it...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.269
...I'd be thinking of Phyllis Diller.

16:25.760 --> 16:30.197
- Al, get the door.
- Yes, my queen.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.149
Oh, Jefferson,
what the hell do you want?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.191
A place to sleep.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.273
Hey, wait a minute. What-?

16:40.480 --> 16:44.519
What are you two doing down here
together in your pyjamas?

16:45.120 --> 16:48.715
I thought you were gay.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.071
I am.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.834
- Does Peggy know about this?
- Peggy sent me down here.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.599
You people are...

16:59.800 --> 17:01.313
...sick.

17:03.760 --> 17:07.116
Yes, we are, Jefferson. Sick enough
to turn your head into a gravy boat...

17:07.319 --> 17:09.038
...if you don't get out of here.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.388
I can't leave.

17:10.599 --> 17:15.276
Marcy's mad at me just because
I called out Mandy's name in bed.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.758
Excuse me.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.232
You know, for a lesbian,
you sure spend a lot of time with men.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.675
And what are you doing here
in your pyjamas?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.792
Oh, I'm sorry, Peggy.
Marcy kicked me out.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.991
And she threw away our ball.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.838
Al Bundy, this is all your fault.

17:33.040 --> 17:36.589
- Why is it all my fault?
- It just is. Get up.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.199
I want you to go to Marcy's...

17:38.400 --> 17:40.755
...and tell her to get her relatives
out of my house.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.234
Oh, that's a good idea, Peg.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.398
Because when I see Marcy
in her pyjamas, I'll have a seizure.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.433
On my way to the hospital,
between the blaring of the sirens...

17:48.640 --> 17:52.076
...and the paramedics yelling " Clear,"
maybe then I can get some sleep.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.590
Hate Mandy. Hate Mandy.
Hate Mandy.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.429
- Hate her. Hate her. Hate her.
- Marcy.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.959
What are you doing up here?

18:06.160 --> 18:10.039
Oh, you know me. Can't keep me out
of a shrill woman's bedroom.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.912
- Go home.
- I'd like to.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.874
But my living room is full of women,
men and your cousin.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.759
Why is that, Marcy?

18:17.960 --> 18:21.236
Because I hate Mandy,
and I never wanna speak to her again.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.477
That's understandable. No one
should have to speak with family.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.989
If I were king, I'd make it a law.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.395
You're the tree-hugging bra-burner
around here.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.079
What do you care if she's gay?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.919
I don't hate Mandy
because she's gay.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.636
I hate Mandy because everyone
likes her better than me!

18:46.880 --> 18:50.156
All our lives,
Mandy was the talented one.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.839
Mandy was the popular one.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.359
And the pretty one?

18:56.480 --> 18:59.278
She stole all my boyfriends,
and now I've found out...

18:59.480 --> 19:01.755
...she didn't even want them!

19:06.360 --> 19:11.195
Why does everyone like her
better than me?

19:11.840 --> 19:15.753
Well, for starters, she never
blew her nose in my pyjama top.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.835
I know I'm not perfect,
but I do have some good qualities.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.315
Sure, if you say so.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.873
- Name one?
- Oh, jeez, I don't know.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.311
Well, you've got
a high school diploma...

19:33.760 --> 19:36.593
...and you never let your eyebrows
grow together.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.394
Perfect height for a lawn jockey.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.555
Wait a minute. I got it.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.309
I'll bet you're the reasonable one.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.395
- Me?
- Yes.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.870
You're big enough
and wise enough...

19:52.080 --> 19:55.038
...to sit down with Mandy-
Over here.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.228
and talk this thing out.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.030
Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Al.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.959
I am the reasonable one.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.151
- Al?
- Yeah?

20:11.720 --> 20:15.633
Are we alone together in my bedroom
hugging in the middle of the night?

20:22.040 --> 20:24.395
See you at the All-Star Game.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.114
One more game of foosball?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.952
I'd love to, Al, but Marcy's waiting
to take me to the airport.

20:31.160 --> 20:36.188
Oh, yes. And we wouldn't want Mandy
to miss her plane.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.958
You know, Peg, I'm really sorry...

20:40.160 --> 20:42.549
...that we didn't get to know
one another better.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.155
I think I know enough.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.028
Well, there's one thing
you may not know.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.874
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.718
I think you're gorgeous.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.231
Oh, really?

21:06.880 --> 21:09.394
Don't be a stranger.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.560
Remember, she was my friend first.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.432
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.677
Hey, guess what.
Lucky's not depressed anymore.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.552
Found a little friend in the park.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.237
His name's Spike.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.510
I think they're in love.
