Anita:
Fired?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.380
Not fired, downsized.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.170
All the big companies
are doing it.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.960
It's so in this year!

01:19.960 --> 01:21.380
So, you're out.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.830
But I thought
you liked my work.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.880
Oh, I do!
You're the best!

01:27.880 --> 01:30.710
But if I downsize an employee
as good as you,

01:30.710 --> 01:32.790
imagine how good
the competition will think

01:32.790 --> 01:35.250
my other employees are.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.830
Anita Dearly's off--
old office.

01:41.830 --> 01:45.080
Anita, baby,
Ralphie St. Lowrent.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.120
-I hear you're a free agent.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.710
How did you know?

01:48.710 --> 01:49.960
-It just happened.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.540
Word travels fast
in this business.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.960
Now you're free
to work for me, hmm?

01:53.960 --> 01:56.670
Well, I do need a job.

01:56.670 --> 01:58.960
I want you to work with me
on my new spring line.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.290
Come by this afternoon.

02:00.290 --> 02:03.330
I'll give you my sketches,
but keep them under your hat.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.540
-They're top secret.

02:05.540 --> 02:07.670
Not for long.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.120
-P.H. De Vil,

02:14.120 --> 02:17.960
mad scientist, evil genius,
junk food connoisseur.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.040
Spare me
the sales pitch, cousin.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.040
Begin phase two,
and remember,

02:22.040 --> 02:24.380
for this job,
we need a plump puppy.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.790
Hey, guys!

02:26.790 --> 02:28.620
Anita's got a new job!

02:28.620 --> 02:29.620
Whoa!

02:30.710 --> 02:33.380
She doesn't work
for Cruella anymore.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.380
Don't toy with my emotions.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.960
I'm fragile...

02:36.960 --> 02:39.040
and so are you.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.040
No, really!

02:40.040 --> 02:42.040
She just called Roger!
I overheard!

02:42.040 --> 02:43.460
Isn't that great?

02:47.830 --> 02:48.880
Oh!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.500
Well? Let me see him.

03:28.790 --> 03:31.040
He's perfect!

03:31.040 --> 03:32.790
Just perfect!

03:34.830 --> 03:38.620
This could be considered
a design flaw.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.000
Not to worry.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.540
There.

03:41.540 --> 03:44.120
Robo Rolly should work
perfectly now.

03:56.170 --> 04:00.540
Time to begin
Operation Fashion Storm!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.880
What a fake.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.670
No one will ever
think you're me.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.170
Oh, hello, Rolly.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.250
Rolly, look what's on
The Junk Food Channel:

04:24.250 --> 04:26.420
A Salute to Fritters!

04:26.420 --> 04:27.960
Your favorite!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.290
Rolly?

04:29.290 --> 04:31.920
Boy, Rolly's sure
acting weird.

04:31.920 --> 04:32.960
Mm-hmm.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.790
Hey, don't you want
to eat, Rolly?

04:40.790 --> 04:44.040
Rolly's never missed
a meal in his life.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.420
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
Huh?

05:14.330 --> 05:16.500
Rolly's a robot.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.880
Yikes!

05:17.880 --> 05:19.250
Cruella:
Now I can steal

05:19.250 --> 05:21.920
all of Ralphie
St. Lowrent's designs

05:21.920 --> 05:23.830
without leaving
the comfort of home!

05:23.830 --> 05:27.580
Corporate espionage!
I love it!

05:30.040 --> 05:31.460
Rolly's not Rolly!

05:31.460 --> 05:34.040
His-- his-- his mouth
opened like a--

05:34.040 --> 05:36.710
and-- and then this camera
popped out of his neck

05:36.710 --> 05:40.580
and-- and then he's--
he's-- he's a robot!

05:43.500 --> 05:45.290
Of course he is.

05:45.290 --> 05:47.620
We're all robots.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.790
Lucky, this is the plot

05:50.790 --> 05:52.920
from that movie
we watched last night:

05:52.920 --> 05:56.620
Plan K-9
From Outer Space.

05:56.620 --> 05:59.380
I know that,
but that was a movie.

05:59.380 --> 06:01.330
This is reality.

06:01.330 --> 06:02.830
See for yourself.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.420
Watch.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.170
Any second now,
a camera or-- or a laser gun

06:12.170 --> 06:14.330
or who knows what
will come out of his face.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.420
Hi, Rolly!

06:29.540 --> 06:30.790
Sure, Lucky.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.540
Maybe a panel will open
on his back

06:32.540 --> 06:35.330
and a big, metal claw
will pop out.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.960
Cadpig:
I bet it's Cruella
stealing Anita's work!

06:44.960 --> 06:46.620
We gotta stop her.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.330
Come back here
with my new spring line!

06:54.330 --> 06:55.880
-Ooh!

07:04.620 --> 07:06.420
Why are we stopping here?

07:06.420 --> 07:07.620
Motor mutt's catching up!

07:07.620 --> 07:10.210
I know. I'm gonna
use Anita's briefcase

07:10.210 --> 07:11.750
as bait to trap it.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.500
-Here, doggy!

07:17.500 --> 07:19.330
Got a treat for ya!

07:27.580 --> 07:29.620
-Now let's go find Rolly.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.920
-Aah!

07:34.500 --> 07:37.170
-Dearly Farm, we have a problem.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.460
Okay, you guys grab
one end of the chain

07:49.460 --> 07:50.670
and I'll grab the other.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.500
We'll wind him up tight.
That'll stop him.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.670
Lucky:
Now!

08:03.670 --> 08:05.420
Get him!

08:09.120 --> 08:10.710
That's gotta hold him.

08:10.710 --> 08:13.750
Cadpig:
Hooray for heavy gauge metal!

08:20.750 --> 08:23.380
Not so fast!

08:31.710 --> 08:34.080
I wonder if
this comes in petite.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.580
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

08:50.710 --> 08:54.790
Mr. Mayor, we need you to put
some political pressure on him!

08:56.670 --> 09:00.210
What breed of dog is that?

09:00.210 --> 09:03.540
I don't know, sir,
but he did not vote for you.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.580
What?!

09:08.120 --> 09:10.330
Son, let me tell you

09:10.330 --> 09:13.880
about the accomplishments
of my administration.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.380
He'll never get out
from under that.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.920
Now let's go find Rolly.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.380
They're getting away!

09:20.380 --> 09:21.880
After them, doggy!

09:21.880 --> 09:24.290
Kill! Kill!

09:24.290 --> 09:27.540
I won't be foiled by pork!

09:33.880 --> 09:35.460
All:
Psst! Psst! Psst!

09:35.460 --> 09:38.330
Hey, guys!
Over here!

09:38.330 --> 09:40.790
Don't worry, Rolly!
We'll have you out in a sec.

09:40.790 --> 09:41.830
Wait!

09:41.830 --> 09:44.000
How do we know
he's the real Rolly?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.460
He could be another robot.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.380
Aw, come on, guys!

09:47.380 --> 09:48.670
You gotta let me out!

09:48.670 --> 09:51.330
I'm starvin' here!

09:51.330 --> 09:53.500
Okay, I'm convinced.

09:53.500 --> 09:57.080
Back there,
when I became mayor--

09:57.080 --> 09:59.500
Beat it, piggy,
or you're sausage!

10:20.380 --> 10:22.540
Cruella, what are
you doing here?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.420
I-- I just stopped by

10:24.420 --> 10:26.000
for a, um, cup of sugar.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.960
Oh, and maybe
an anti-tank gun

10:27.960 --> 10:29.420
if you're not using yours.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.330
Is something wrong?

10:34.420 --> 10:35.880
What is that?

10:35.880 --> 10:37.460
Ah-ha!

10:40.580 --> 10:42.540
Anita:
Oh, my

10:42.540 --> 10:43.540
-Aah!

10:44.710 --> 10:47.500
Cruella, my missing designs.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.620
Um...

10:48.620 --> 10:50.330
say, did I mention

10:50.330 --> 10:52.880
we're having a really good week
at the House of DeVil

10:52.880 --> 10:54.500
and you're rehired?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.830
Why should I go back
to work for you?

10:58.830 --> 11:00.210
I have a job.

11:00.210 --> 11:03.460
Uh, I'll, uh,
give you a raise!

11:04.540 --> 11:05.830
Uh, make that two raises.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.880
I'll even throw in
a new door!

11:07.880 --> 11:11.210
Well, see you tomorrow
at work. Ciao!

11:16.250 --> 11:19.250
Well, our work here is done.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.330
Have we learned
anything from this?

11:21.330 --> 11:23.040
No, but Cruella has.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.790
Maybe she needs
a little more time
to think about it.

11:26.790 --> 11:28.290
Heh heh heh.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.210
Whew.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.790
Whew. My, my,
this day is a cooker.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.040
You said it, honey.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.960
I'm so hot,
I'm giving steamed milk.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.420
-Dumpling: Daddy!

12:06.420 --> 12:08.250
The mud dried up.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.960
-Yeah.
-I'm stuck.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.120
Lucy:
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

12:14.120 --> 12:15.830
My feet are burning up.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.790
It must be 100 degrees.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.290
I think they invented summer

12:19.290 --> 12:21.750
just to annoy me.

12:21.750 --> 12:25.120
Ah, Hiccup Hole,

12:25.120 --> 12:28.790
my oasis of calm and quiet.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.750
Rolly:
Cannonball!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.420
Cadpig:
Last one in
is a rotten egg!

12:32.420 --> 12:34.290
Yeah! Cannonball!

12:34.290 --> 12:35.540
Yeah!

12:35.540 --> 12:37.040
Whoa!

12:37.040 --> 12:39.290
Rolly:
Incoming!

12:40.380 --> 12:41.620
Whoa...

12:56.330 --> 12:58.290
Ooh, hooligans! Get out!

12:58.290 --> 13:01.380
Get out of my pond!
Now shoo!

13:01.380 --> 13:02.580
Go home!

13:02.580 --> 13:04.210
It's too hot at home.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.420
Besides, this pond
is for everybody.

13:06.420 --> 13:08.540
You can't hog it all
for yourself.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.790
You impudent little pup.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.250
I was swimming here
before you were born!

13:14.250 --> 13:16.380
Then it's time you got out.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.920
You're gettin' all pruny.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.330
Mrs. Wrinkle-Bottom!

13:21.330 --> 13:22.830
Well, I never.

13:22.830 --> 13:25.830
You are the rudest,
most annoying youngster

13:25.830 --> 13:27.380
I have ever met.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.580
Well, you're just
a whiny, old windbag.

13:30.580 --> 13:34.580
Oh! You haven't heard
the last of this.

13:37.290 --> 13:40.080
Oh, sure.
What's she gonna do,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.960
report us to our parents?

13:41.960 --> 13:46.420
But, Dad, we just wanted
to go swimmin'.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.080
They splashed me.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.170
They assaulted
and insulted me.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.250
I demand an apology.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.330
We've got as much right
to use Hiccup Hole as you do.

13:56.330 --> 13:58.000
You don't own it.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.330
Well, that doesn't give you
the right to splash her.

14:00.330 --> 14:04.210
She was just trying to enjoy
a nice, peaceful, quiet swim.

14:04.210 --> 14:08.040
But what's the fun of swimmin'
if you can't whoop it up?

14:08.040 --> 14:11.290
We all have different ways
of enjoying ourselves.

14:11.290 --> 14:13.580
Perdita:
And you had no right
to call Lucy names.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.920
You all owe Lucy an apology.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.080
-Lucky, you most of all.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.960
Uh, for the record,

14:19.960 --> 14:23.290
I never actually
splashed Lucy.

14:23.290 --> 14:24.210
-Ow!

14:25.210 --> 14:27.380
But this is so unfair!

14:27.380 --> 14:29.290
Whatever happened
to justice?

14:29.290 --> 14:31.120
Whatever happened to honor?

14:31.120 --> 14:34.000
Rolly:
Whatever happened to
that little piece of fat

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
you get in pork and beans?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.080
We won't apologize.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.540
It's a matter of principle!

14:39.540 --> 14:43.330
Oh, and do the rest of you
feel the same way as Lucky?

14:43.330 --> 14:45.290
I'm throwing my support

14:45.290 --> 14:47.500
firmly behind
my bullheaded brother.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.210
Me too.

14:49.210 --> 14:50.500
I guess.

14:50.500 --> 14:55.500
Now, did I make it clear
I didn't actually do anything?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.290
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.540
You would have

14:58.540 --> 15:01.290
if you'd ever actually
made it into the water.

15:01.290 --> 15:04.210
Well, I didn't call
Lucy any names.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.750
I didn't hear you jump in
and defend her either.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.170
You're part of this, Spot.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.250
Deal with it.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.380
Well, until you all apologize,

15:11.380 --> 15:13.420
Hiccup Hole is off-limits.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.210
-You gotta be--
-No fair!

15:16.210 --> 15:18.170
Isn't that a bit harsh?

15:19.330 --> 15:21.080
But fair, very fair.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.790
No apology,
no Hiccup Hole.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.540
I hate it when I have
to get tough with them.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.080
Oh, Pongo.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.170
What?

15:45.670 --> 15:48.290
Bok-bok-bok-boy, it's hot.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.920
I think my nose
is melting.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.500
My aura is dehydrating.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.290
Well, I don't care.

15:55.290 --> 15:57.920
I'm glad we stood up
for our principles.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.750
Couldn't we have
saved our principles

16:00.750 --> 16:02.790
for a day when
it wasn't so hot?

16:02.790 --> 16:04.710
Don't give in so easily.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.330
There's more than one way
to keep cool.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.080
Follow me!

16:09.080 --> 16:10.710
Well, come on!

16:14.710 --> 16:16.210
The swamp?

16:16.210 --> 16:17.790
This is your better idea?

16:17.790 --> 16:21.080
May I remind you
of a few of the dangers,

16:21.080 --> 16:25.120
like snakes and alligators
and malaria and quicksand

16:25.120 --> 16:26.620
and deadly swamp gas?

16:26.620 --> 16:27.830
You're one of those

16:27.830 --> 16:30.420
glass-is-half-empty
people, aren't you?

16:30.420 --> 16:32.540
Stop worrying, Spot.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.880
Where there's a swamp,
there's water.

16:34.880 --> 16:39.580
Yeah, and leeches
the size of cocker spaniels.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.170
Yeah!

16:44.170 --> 16:46.420
-Hey!
-Whoa, papa!

16:46.420 --> 16:48.420
Rolly:
You were right, Luck.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.750
Who needs Hiccup Hole?

16:49.750 --> 16:51.210
We found our own.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.500
Yahoo!

16:52.500 --> 16:54.830
Last one in's a rotten tamale!

16:59.750 --> 17:00.750
All:
Spot!

17:02.580 --> 17:04.540
Get!

17:04.540 --> 17:06.000
Me!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.540
Out!

17:08.880 --> 17:10.290
Come on!

17:28.500 --> 17:33.080
Well, I think this dalmatian
is ready to apologize.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.920
Rolly! You can't give up now.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.380
Hiccup Hole isn't just a pond.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.620
It-- it's a symbol

17:39.620 --> 17:43.170
of freedom and justice
and-- and home and country

17:43.170 --> 17:45.960
and-- and--
and... apple pie.

17:48.330 --> 17:50.620
Would that apple pie
be à la mode?

17:50.620 --> 17:51.830
Come on.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.210
We have to stick together.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.210
Cruella's pool?

17:59.210 --> 18:00.620
Are you crazy?

18:00.620 --> 18:02.960
Cruella's not even around.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.250
I don't know about you guys,

18:04.250 --> 18:07.120
but this opportunity
is too good to be wasted.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.000
Come on.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.040
Right.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.750
You know who's gonna find us

18:13.750 --> 18:16.710
just as soon as
we're in a vulnerable position.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.330
Yet somehow,
it never seems to stop us.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.080
Okay, biggest splash wins!

18:35.500 --> 18:38.500
You're absolutely sure
you checked all the systems?

18:38.500 --> 18:40.380
-Checked.
-Double-checked.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.210
We did it twice too.

18:42.210 --> 18:43.880
-Ooh!
-Good.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.500
I want nothing left to chance
when I test my new

18:46.500 --> 18:49.000
state of the art
swimless swimsuit.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.210
The House of DeVil
will free humankind forever

18:52.210 --> 18:54.960
from the tedium
of actually swimming.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.420
Now stand back
and observe genius.

19:05.710 --> 19:08.420
Cruella doesn't look like
she's in a hurry to leave.

19:08.420 --> 19:11.790
If she sees us up here,
we're sitting ducks.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.000
Speak for yourself.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.620
Just lay low, you guys.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.790
She can't see us
from down there.

19:16.790 --> 19:20.250
I think I'll practice
my swan dive.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.080
We're trapped!

19:26.080 --> 19:27.040
What can we do now?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.330
Um, think happy thoughts?

19:29.330 --> 19:30.960
-Oh!

19:30.960 --> 19:32.500
You're not a happy thought.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.460
I didn't know we were
having a pool party.

19:36.710 --> 19:39.120
So nice of you
to drop by.

19:39.120 --> 19:43.170
Next time, call ahead,
and I'll plan a little fling.

19:43.170 --> 19:44.960
-Get those pups!

19:48.830 --> 19:50.960
Sometimes it's good
to be the chicken.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.290
Fools.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.880
Aah! No! Get away,
get away, get away!

20:00.880 --> 20:03.500
Let go!

20:03.500 --> 20:04.670
-Oh!

20:04.670 --> 20:06.330
Huh

20:07.420 --> 20:09.790
Cruella:
Stop me, you idiots!

20:12.880 --> 20:14.790
Cadpig:
Yikes!

20:27.120 --> 20:31.580
-You know, I'm beginning
to understand how Lucy felt.

20:32.670 --> 20:33.920
Wouldn't it be great

20:33.920 --> 20:36.080
to take a nice,
quiet swim

20:36.080 --> 20:37.830
without being bothered?

20:37.830 --> 20:39.080
I hear ya.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.790
Not that I bothered her,
by the way.

20:41.790 --> 20:45.210
You've been abundantly clear
on that point.

20:45.210 --> 20:48.460
I don't know
about the rest of you,

20:48.460 --> 20:51.120
but I'm ready to apologize.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.000
But what about our principles?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.330
You know, I actually
don't recall principles

20:58.330 --> 21:00.620
where it's okay
to call people names.

21:00.620 --> 21:02.750
Interesting concept though.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.750
Rolly:
I can hold my breath
longer than you for sure!

21:16.460 --> 21:19.580
Lucy, can I talk to you?

21:19.580 --> 21:20.750
Hmph!

21:21.880 --> 21:24.000
Okay, let me start by saying,

21:24.000 --> 21:26.380
we all have a right
to swim in Hiccup Hole,

21:26.380 --> 21:30.250
and, hey,
a pup's gotta splash.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.880
That wasn't a splash.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.830
That was a tidal wave.

21:33.830 --> 21:36.290
Okay, so maybe I overdid it,

21:36.290 --> 21:38.500
and I shouldn't have
called you names.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.710
There, I said it.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.170
Excuse me?

21:41.170 --> 21:42.580
Said what?

21:42.580 --> 21:45.540
You know, that thing
I was supposed to say.

21:45.540 --> 21:47.620
I may be a cranky,
old goose,

21:47.620 --> 21:50.500
but I am not hard of hearing.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.170
I believe what
Lucky is trying to say

21:53.170 --> 21:55.710
is that his ability
to understand your needs

21:55.710 --> 21:57.710
and your point of view
was hampered

21:57.710 --> 21:58.710
by his own selfish--

21:58.710 --> 22:01.830
Okay, okay,
I-- I admit it.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.290
I'm sorry.

22:03.290 --> 22:06.880
Well, then I guess
I accept your apology.
