She's malfunctioned.

00:07.372 --> 00:09.139
At best, she's defiant.

At worst, she
could be dangerous.

00:11.705 --> 00:14.872

She's my best friend.

The fourth slot was for the
vicious android

01:02.539 --> 01:04.438

01:04.539 --> 01:06.072
And this slot is for...

01:06.172 --> 01:07.472

- Genius, sir.
You really are on your A game.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.472
- Right away, sir.
Right away.

01:13.572 --> 01:16.439
Now, we know that by
accessing the droid sync port,

01:16.472 --> 01:19.339
we can lure
Dr. Gaines's android to us.

01:19.439 --> 01:22.939
But the question is, to
where do we lure her?

01:23.039 --> 01:24.872
- Just bring her here, PEGSy.

01:24.972 --> 01:27.072

01:35.639 --> 01:38.739
I expect nothing but
smooth sailing from here on...

01:40.039 --> 01:41.339

01:43.439 --> 01:45.572
- Your internal software
seems unaffected,

01:45.672 --> 01:49.272
but it looks like there's
a hardware malfunction.

01:49.439 --> 01:52.105
The fan's failure caused
her system to overheat,

01:52.205 --> 01:54.872
thus melting her
synthetic vocal cords.

01:54.972 --> 01:58.172
- That's a quick fix, right?
- I'm afraid not.

01:58.272 --> 01:59.572
Synthetic vocal cords
aren't something

That's what I was afraid of.

My lab's not equipped to
manufacture new cords.

02:10.705 --> 02:12.905
I'm going to need
to do some research.

of quiet here for a few days.

your sister,

from me, and you lied.

02:39.005 --> 02:41.072
- Mm, surprise me.

02:44.005 --> 02:46.339

problems with her system?

02:46.439 --> 02:48.905

is perfectly intact.

The point is, if
Frankie's hair isn't real,
