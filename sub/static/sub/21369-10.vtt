00:06.880 --> 00:07.670
Raven:
Raven's Home was filmed

00:07.670 --> 00:09.380
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.750
Can you believe
my mom kicked us out
for being annoying?

00:15.750 --> 00:20.250
To be fair, we were having
an annoying sound contest.

00:20.250 --> 00:24.460
It was the only way to know
if marbles in blender beats
hammer on frying pan.

00:25.710 --> 00:29.920
I still think it was...
(screeching)

00:29.920 --> 00:32.330
I'm start-- I'm starting to see
why she kicked us out.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.040
Well, I'm out of ideas.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.670
Guess we're just gonna be
bored all day.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.500
Unless a giant gorilla
climbed up the side
of the building.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.620
I wish.
I'd name him Mr. Bananas
and ride on his shoulders

00:48.620 --> 00:51.290
through the streets
of Chicago.

00:51.290 --> 00:53.170
(sighs)
Like that'll ever happen.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.420
Boy's voice:
Hey, can I get
a little help here?

01:00.250 --> 01:02.710
(grunting)

01:02.710 --> 01:05.210
Way to spring
into action, fellas.

01:05.210 --> 01:07.500
I'm Wally.
I just moved into the building.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.330
I'm Levi.
That's Booker.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.830
Where did you get this thing?

01:10.830 --> 01:12.500
Found this bad boy
in the dumpster
and dragged it

01:12.500 --> 01:13.790
up the fire escape.

01:13.790 --> 01:15.880
You guys wanna help me
build a catapult with it?

01:15.880 --> 01:17.790
More than anything
in the world!

01:19.920 --> 01:23.790
This should launch him
across the roof, and land him
safely in that pile of pillows.

01:23.790 --> 01:25.330
Levi's gonna love this.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.580
-(crashes)
-(car alarm blaring)

01:31.580 --> 01:34.000
-Whoa!
-He went right over the side!

01:36.830 --> 01:39.210
Man, I'm gonna
miss that dummy.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.080
Sure you don't wanna
give it a try, Levi?

01:42.080 --> 01:45.210
Believe it or not,
the answer's still no.

(laughing)

02:39.250 --> 02:40.670
Hey, Chels, what you
lookin' at?

02:40.670 --> 02:42.080
Yeah, I'm
not sure,

02:42.080 --> 02:43.500
but I think
some kids

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
just threw
a dummy off
the roof.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.500
Those are
some real
bad kids.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.620
You know who
I blame?

02:49.620 --> 02:50.670
The parents.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.420
(eerie music plays)

02:56.420 --> 02:57.620
(humming)

03:09.290 --> 03:12.670
(gasps,
mumbles)
Clown.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.790
(whimpering)

03:17.830 --> 03:19.920
(squeals softly)

03:19.920 --> 03:22.580
(ghostly laughter)

03:23.580 --> 03:26.080
(grunting)
Clown.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.420
Ohh...

03:37.040 --> 03:39.330
Chels! Clown!

03:39.330 --> 03:43.040
Hall! I almost peed!

03:44.670 --> 03:46.040
What? A clown?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.330
Oh, Rae, there's
no clowns

03:47.330 --> 03:49.500
in this
building.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.580
Listen, you have
got to get over
this clown phobia.

03:51.580 --> 03:54.620
No! Chels! Chels!
I saw it with my own eyes!

03:54.620 --> 03:59.830
It was a creepy, face-painted,
"we gotta move 'cause it knows
where I live" clown, girl!

03:59.830 --> 04:01.120
Well, let me go see!

04:01.120 --> 04:02.620
No, Chels, don't!

04:02.620 --> 04:03.580
Don't, Chels, no!

04:03.580 --> 04:06.380
No, Chels, no!

04:09.710 --> 04:12.420
Rae, there's no clown!

04:13.540 --> 04:16.170
It was right there.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.580
It's probably just somebody
havin' a kid's birthday party.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.830
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

04:20.830 --> 04:23.540
Clowns are always somethin'
to worry about, Chels.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.250
-Rae, I think you're bein'--
-Chels, listen!

04:27.250 --> 04:30.540
All right?
They cannot be trusted.
Their shoes are too big,

04:30.540 --> 04:34.750
their cars are too small,
and they're always smilin'
that freakish, freakish smile!

04:34.750 --> 04:36.920
No one smiles that much,
Chels, no one!

04:38.120 --> 04:39.620
Well, I smile a lot.

04:39.620 --> 04:43.790
Yeah, and you know what?
I worry about you, too.

04:43.790 --> 04:47.250
Look, Rae, the clown's gone,
so you're safe to go do
the laundry, all right?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.080
(whimpering)

04:52.080 --> 04:54.880
(whining noises)

04:58.210 --> 05:00.580
I'm sorry, did you want me
to go do the laundry?

05:00.580 --> 05:02.380
Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.380
Ms. Baxter, I got you.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.080
(gasps)

05:16.080 --> 05:17.620
The clown is gonna get me!

05:19.040 --> 05:20.670
(grumbles)

05:24.080 --> 05:26.420
Mom, where are you?

05:27.500 --> 05:30.170
Mom, you can answer me,
I don't want money.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.620
What you need, baby?

05:35.040 --> 05:36.830
Can our new friend Wally
come over?

05:36.830 --> 05:38.500
-Sure, but I need to meet him.
-When he gets here,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.790
can you come outta there
and not be weird?

05:42.290 --> 05:44.670
It's my house.
I do what I want.

05:47.330 --> 05:50.580
Oh, hey, Aunt Chels.
If you're lookin' for Mom,
she's in the closet...

05:50.580 --> 05:51.750
being weird.

05:54.790 --> 05:56.750
Oh...

05:56.750 --> 05:57.880
What are you doing?

05:57.880 --> 06:00.250
What?
I'm a perfectly
rational woman,

06:00.250 --> 06:02.790
chillin' in her closet,
waitin' for a clown
to attack her.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.670
Now if you'll excuse me.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.710
Oh, yeah, Rae, you sound
totally norm-- oh my gosh,
there's a clown!

06:09.710 --> 06:12.000
(yelling)

06:14.540 --> 06:16.210
Where'd he go?

06:16.210 --> 06:17.540
Okay, Rae, give me the bat.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.750
-Yeah.
And the ankle bat.
-What?

06:19.750 --> 06:23.830
Mm-hm.
Give it to me. Okay.

06:23.830 --> 06:26.000
-And the secret bat.
-How'd you know
about my secret bat?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.920
I know about the secret bat.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.540
This is crazy.
You are not gonna
get attacked by clowns!

06:32.540 --> 06:34.170
Yes, I am, Chels,
I had a vision.

06:34.170 --> 06:36.040
The clown is comin' to get me
right in my own home!

06:36.040 --> 06:39.580
Okay, is it possible that maybe
you misinterpreted your vision?

06:39.580 --> 06:42.710
When have I ever
misint-- terpet-- don't--
don't answer that.

06:42.710 --> 06:45.620
Okay?
You're gonna be fine.

06:45.620 --> 06:48.040
You're right.
I am gonna be fine, Chels.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.620
You know why?
Ha, 'cause you didn't get
my double secret bat.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.120
Thanks for moving the sleepover
to your place.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.920
My mom's hosting
book club tonight.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.710
-No, she isn't.
-No, she isn't.

07:07.710 --> 07:11.500
She just started
using natural deodorant,
and it ain't workin'.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.880
Hey, I think you dropped
this stuff.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.750
I don't need some guy
to help me pick up my--

07:19.540 --> 07:22.750
I mean...
if it's not too much trouble.

07:24.460 --> 07:25.670
Oops.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.880
Whoa.
It's almost like you guys

07:28.880 --> 07:30.500
are dropping this stuff
on purpose.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.750
You have eyelashes
like a beautiful pony.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.710
My belly button
smells like rice.

07:37.330 --> 07:38.580
Good to know.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.290
We're gonna go now.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.290
That was horrible.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.330
At least we'll never
see him again.

07:51.330 --> 07:52.830
(knocking on door)

07:52.830 --> 07:54.580
That must be Wally.

07:56.170 --> 07:57.880
Who's Wally?

07:59.580 --> 08:02.540
Oh, no.
He's in your house.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.920
Just be cool and make
a graceful exit.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.120
(screams)

08:08.120 --> 08:09.120
Aaah!

08:10.420 --> 08:13.620
-What now?
-Just crawl, man!
Just crawl!

08:16.790 --> 08:18.580
Sorry about that.

08:18.580 --> 08:24.080
That was just my weird sister
and her weird friend
being... weird.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.580
It's cool.
Everybody's family's
a little weird.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.460
(exhales)
Booker, hold my bat,
I gotta use the bathroom.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.790
Our family's a lot weird.

08:37.170 --> 08:39.120
Hey, Mom,
this is Wally.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.960
Oh, hey, Wally,
nice to meet you.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.120
Come on, tell me
about yourself,
but keep it short,

08:43.120 --> 08:45.540
'cause remember,
I gotta tinkle.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.880
-Well, I'm in seventh grade.
-Mm-hm.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.170
My parents and I
just moved in from Colorado.

08:51.170 --> 08:53.380
My dad's an accountant,
my mom's a clown,

08:53.380 --> 08:55.920
and I'm a Leo,
which means I'm adventurous.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.830
What'd you just say?

08:59.830 --> 09:03.790
Oh. Don't worry,
Levi's a Virgo, so he'll
watch out for all of us.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.620
He's right.
I'm a real caregiver.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.290
I'm sorry, no, no, no,
about your mama.

09:10.290 --> 09:13.330
Did you say your mama
was a... clown?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.460
Yeah. She retired
from the circus
when she had me.

09:17.460 --> 09:18.920
And now
she does birthday parties.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.210
Satisfied, Mom?
Now you know him
better than I do.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.210
Come on.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.460
There's a little baby clown
in my house!

09:37.000 --> 09:40.080
Behold, Fort McFort.
Pretty great, right?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.960
Don't worry, guys.
We'll rebuild it.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.000
What do you guys think?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.250
The new Fort McFort is awesome.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.880
Everybody's gonna wanna
get in.

09:52.880 --> 09:53.960
We need a password.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.120
What about
"Password McPassword"?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.790
Access granted.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.920
Get in there.
You too, big guy.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.920
He just called me "big guy."

10:06.120 --> 10:08.250
And he wasn't being sarcastic.

10:11.960 --> 10:16.290
(sniffs)
Smells like somebody's
baking cookies.

10:16.290 --> 10:20.710
This better work.
I can't embarrass myself
in front of Pony Eyes again.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.500
That's my nickname for Wally.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.000
Don't worry, you won't.
Once these cookies
get him in here,

10:27.000 --> 10:28.960
we'll show him
how cool we really are.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.830
Okay.
So, what's your plan?

10:32.040 --> 10:34.620
I got nothin'.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.380
We don't have a plan?
Shut the door!
Shut the door!

10:36.380 --> 10:39.620
-Hey, guys.
-Girls: Hey, Wally.

10:40.790 --> 10:42.540
I hate us so much right now.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.580
Any chance you got
an extra one of those?

10:45.580 --> 10:48.120
Really? You like
fresh-baked cookies?

10:48.120 --> 10:50.500
Everybody likes
fresh-baked cookies.

10:52.460 --> 10:55.500
I know what you're doin'.
You're tryin' to hang out
with Wally 'cause he's awesome.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.040
-That's ridiculous.
-Yeah. We're tryin'
to hang out with him

10:58.040 --> 10:59.380
'cause he's cute.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.460
Gross. That's why
you're bein' so weird?

11:03.460 --> 11:06.170
I'm not gonna let you
creep Wally out.

11:06.170 --> 11:08.250
Come on, guys, let's go back
to Fort McFort.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.960
It's almost 0600.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.620
That's
when we do hip-hop karaoke.

11:15.460 --> 11:18.170
(sighs)
That was a disaster.

11:18.170 --> 11:20.500
Yeah, we get mad stupid
around that kid.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.330
If we don't wanna
embarrass ourselves again,

11:22.330 --> 11:25.420
the safest thing to do
is the exact opposite
of what we wanna do.

11:25.420 --> 11:27.620
I wanna go smell his hair.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.580
We cannot be trusted.

11:39.790 --> 11:41.250
Hey, Rae.
You feelin' any better?

11:41.250 --> 11:43.580
No. No. A clown moved
into our building,

11:43.580 --> 11:45.290
and now her kid
is friends with our kid.

11:45.290 --> 11:47.580
But you can't
avoid her forever.
She's our neighbor.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.040
(gasps)
You're right,
we should move.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.040
I've got a better idea.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.460
-Come with me.
-Well, I just--

11:55.580 --> 11:57.750
Okay, they say the best way
to conquer your fear

11:57.750 --> 11:58.960
is to face it.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.790
Uh, who are "they"?
They don't know me.

12:01.790 --> 12:04.960
Don't worry, I've brought around
a little something to help you
get comfortable

12:04.960 --> 12:06.210
with your fear of clowns.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.040
You know what would make me
feel comfortable? My bat.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.790
Rae!
Can you please just sit down.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.210
-Okay.
-Thank you.

12:13.210 --> 12:17.000
We are in a safe place.
Okay? Turn the crank.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.620
Chels, I don't want to.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.960
Rae, please?
Just, turn it.

12:25.670 --> 12:29.290
("Pop Goes
the Weasel"
playing)

12:29.290 --> 12:31.330
-Okay, Chels, that was great.
-Keep cranking.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.040
("Pop Goes
the Weasel"
playing)

12:36.040 --> 12:39.170
-Oh, Chels,
you cured me!
-Raven!

12:39.170 --> 12:40.790
(whispers)
Okay, all right.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.750
-I got this. I got this.
-Yeah.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.000
(clears throat)

12:44.000 --> 12:46.500
("Pop Goes
the Weasel"
playing)

12:48.250 --> 12:49.250
(whimpers)

12:50.460 --> 12:52.960
-Ooh.
-(squeals)

12:52.960 --> 12:56.790
Ha-ha! Look at him,
he's so cute, hello,
hello, little clown.

12:56.790 --> 13:00.000
(laughs)
Oh, thanks, Chels, I think
you fixed me.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.290
Hey.
Look who it is?

13:01.290 --> 13:04.080
(screams)

13:04.080 --> 13:07.420
(grunting)

13:07.420 --> 13:09.170
Come here!

13:09.170 --> 13:10.250
Come here!
Come here!

13:10.250 --> 13:11.790
Huah! Ow!

13:13.500 --> 13:15.420
Oh, you ain't gettin' away
that easy!

13:15.420 --> 13:17.210
You ain't gettin' away!

13:18.960 --> 13:20.290
Huh!

13:20.290 --> 13:22.670
(grunting)

13:27.210 --> 13:30.290
(clown deflating)

13:30.290 --> 13:33.080
(laughing hysterically)

13:33.080 --> 13:37.120
I'm gonna nail it to the door
as a warning to other clowns.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.170
Ha-ha!

13:44.000 --> 13:46.210
(robot voice)
I can't believe we had
robot armor

13:46.210 --> 13:48.830
in our recycling bin
the whole time!

13:50.330 --> 13:54.330
I can't believe how many
pizza boxes you guys have.

13:54.330 --> 13:58.080
My mom's in charge
of dinner, so it's kind
of the safest option.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.330
Yo, I lost my contact.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.170
Could one of you
help me find it?

14:04.620 --> 14:07.830
-You don't wear contacts.
-Nobody asked you,
baby shoes.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.420
So, what are you guys doing?

14:12.420 --> 14:15.540
Nah-uh, nah-uh, nah-uh,
I'm shuttin' this down!

14:18.380 --> 14:22.250
Hey, I-- I lost my contact.
Could one of you help me--

14:22.250 --> 14:23.830
you said you were going
to the bathroom.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.330
You said you were going
to the kitchen!

14:25.330 --> 14:28.080
Well, you can't kick it
in Fort McFort.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.040
Yeah.
No entry without the password.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.620
It's probably something dumb
like "Password McPassword."

14:35.920 --> 14:37.750
Darn it, we've been hacked!

14:41.420 --> 14:43.420
It's okay, guys.
They're cool.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.290
Really?
You think we're cool?

14:45.290 --> 14:46.620
You don't think
we're lame anymore?

14:46.620 --> 14:48.250
I never thought
you were lame.

14:49.330 --> 14:51.330
Is it possible
that all of this
was in our heads,

14:51.330 --> 14:53.250
and we never actually
embarrassed ourselves?

14:53.250 --> 14:56.330
That's airtight logic, yo.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.750
I can't believe
we've been driving ourselves
crazy all day.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.960
So, should we stay
and hang out?

15:01.960 --> 15:03.210
(robot voice)
Wally-Bot powering up.

15:03.210 --> 15:06.420
(mimics whirring)
Initiating three-way
high five.

15:06.420 --> 15:07.670
(mimics beeping)

15:09.290 --> 15:11.170
-I'm out.
-Me too.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.330
We have got to change
that password.

15:27.540 --> 15:31.380
Chels? Chels,
I gotta get outta here.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.830
If my vision's correct,
Wally's mom could come through
that door at any moment.

15:34.830 --> 15:39.380
I'm just-- I'm just not ready
to be in the same room
with a clown.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.250
Why don't you go
take a walk?

15:46.290 --> 15:49.380
Good idea, Chels.
Good idea. Good idea.

15:52.710 --> 15:57.250
Coast is clear. (laughs)
All right, now, text me
when she's gone. Okay.

15:58.710 --> 16:01.330
(gasp, high-pitched)
Clown!

16:01.330 --> 16:02.710
(thud)

16:04.330 --> 16:05.540
Woman:
Are you okay?

16:05.540 --> 16:08.000
Don't worry, Ms. Baxter,
I got you.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.420
(screams)

16:09.420 --> 16:10.920
No, no! No, no, no!

16:10.920 --> 16:12.250
No! No, no, no,
I got me!

16:12.250 --> 16:13.420
I got me! (laughs)

16:13.420 --> 16:14.460
Oh!

16:16.080 --> 16:18.080
I'm okay.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.290
I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm Diane, Wally's mom.

16:21.290 --> 16:23.170
Oh, what a horrible
first impression.

16:23.170 --> 16:26.210
Yeah. The-there's a clown--
clown face!

16:26.210 --> 16:28.330
Clown face
comin' towards me!

16:28.330 --> 16:30.380
Well, I was so busy
rushing to get home from work,

16:30.380 --> 16:32.460
I forgot I had this on!
(laughs)

16:32.460 --> 16:33.920
(whimpering)

16:33.920 --> 16:36.880
Mom! Nia and Tess
ruined our fort!

16:36.880 --> 16:40.290
It was bound to happen anyway.
Those sheets weren't up to code.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.380
Mom?
What's going on?

16:43.380 --> 16:45.000
Auntie Rae?
Are you okay?

16:45.000 --> 16:46.670
No. No. Uh-huh.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.670
Ain't okay.
I ain't okay.

16:48.670 --> 16:51.040
There's a clown!
There's a clown
in my house!

16:52.500 --> 16:54.120
Do you have
a problem with me?

16:54.120 --> 16:57.120
(yells)
Yes!

16:57.120 --> 16:59.960
Now, will you please leave,
circus freak.

17:01.790 --> 17:06.790
Wow. Okay.
Come on, Wally.
Let's go home.

17:11.580 --> 17:15.920
Woo! I'm glad she's gone!

17:15.920 --> 17:19.620
Ohh-- it is all good, y'all.
It's all good.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.170
It's that bad, huh?

17:29.750 --> 17:31.540
Why did you say those things
to Wally's mom?

17:31.540 --> 17:33.080
'Cause I'm terrified of clowns.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.000
So you called her names.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.670
You yell at me
when I call Nia names.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.380
That's different.
Your sister's not a clown.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.080
Auntie Rae,
you were really mean to her.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.420
She's never
gonna let Wally come back.

17:44.420 --> 17:48.540
Ms. B, if I didn't sleep here
and eat here and pretty much
live here,

17:48.540 --> 17:50.710
I'd drop some serious truth
on you right now.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.790
That was bad.

17:54.790 --> 17:56.330
Yeah, it was!

17:56.330 --> 17:58.830
Chels, we have
some really judgmental children!

18:00.460 --> 18:04.460
What? No, Rae,
look, I-- I get that
you're scared, okay?

18:04.460 --> 18:07.330
But this is getting
out of control, I mean,

18:07.330 --> 18:09.540
gosh, I've never seen you
treat anyone like that.

18:09.540 --> 18:12.210
Chels, I can't help it.
It's not my fault.

18:12.210 --> 18:16.080
Well, you gotta do somethin',
'cause you just cost our kids
a friend.

18:17.670 --> 18:20.380
-All right. I get it.
I really messed up.
-Yeah.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.750
I gotta find a way
to fix this.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.580
Aunt Chels, what's goin' on?

18:30.580 --> 18:33.710
I don't know, I got this balloon
inviting me to dinner.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.120
-Me too.
-Me too.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.620
I'm Nia's plus one.

18:36.620 --> 18:38.500
(knocking on door)

18:42.670 --> 18:44.620
Oh, hey, Diane, hey, Wally.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.500
Hey, you guys
got a balloon, too.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.080
I had no intention of coming.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.420
But I-- I begged her.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.790
Wally! You're back!

18:50.790 --> 18:52.080
-Hey.
-'Sup.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.250
Hey.

18:53.250 --> 18:54.620
So what's this all about?

18:54.620 --> 18:57.210
Not really sure...

18:57.210 --> 19:02.170
(whimsical music playing)

19:07.710 --> 19:10.080
-Oh...
-My...

19:10.080 --> 19:11.460
Both:
Mom.

19:13.120 --> 19:18.120
(whimsical music continues)

19:38.500 --> 19:40.420
Is this some kind of joke?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.120
This is the weirdest thing
I've ever seen.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.830
Hey, y.
I love coming over here.

20:05.170 --> 20:07.790
Oh, I-- I guess
I'm in the show, too, kids.

20:18.380 --> 20:21.170
She's acting out
her fear of clowns.

20:21.170 --> 20:23.040
That's what she's doing?

20:23.040 --> 20:24.670
Am I the only one
who doesn't get this?

20:24.670 --> 20:26.120
Others:
Yes!

20:36.620 --> 20:39.210
Okay, I'm sorry, Rae,
I got a little carried away.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.580
I think she's trying
to apologize.

21:07.170 --> 21:08.920
(crying)
This is some powerful stuff.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
That was beautiful.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.670
Thank you.

21:36.290 --> 21:39.420
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm just glad it worked.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.670
That was the longest I've ever
gone without talking.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.750
Raven, this was wonderful.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.120
I am really glad
that I accepted
your invitation.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.040
-Me too.
-You know,
I have to admit

21:54.040 --> 21:56.290
this is not how
I thought things
would end up.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.290
Yeah, Mom,
you've come a long way.

21:58.290 --> 21:59.380
You're dressed as a clown,

21:59.380 --> 22:00.670
you've eaten dinner
with a clown.

22:00.670 --> 22:02.580
You've tried Brussels spouts.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.790
Yeah, we're real proud of you,
Ms. B.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.040
Thanks. I'll do anything
for my kids.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.670
Even you, Tess.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.000
The coast is clear.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.540
Raven: Get that big old
gorilla hand outta my house!

22:21.540 --> 22:23.330
Back up, back up!
