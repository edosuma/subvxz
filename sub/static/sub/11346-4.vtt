IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.037 --> 00:05.706
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.242
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.276 --> 00:10.211
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.244 --> 00:11.279
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.312 --> 00:13.414
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.783
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.454
[classical ballet music plays]

00:20.488 --> 00:26.594
*

00:26.627 --> 00:28.462
- HEY.
CONGRATS.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.331
I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORKED.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.000
- THANKS. FINALLY GET TO SHOW
WHAT I CAN DO.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.335
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, THOUGH.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.070
- OH, YOU'RE ON BROADWAY NOW,
GIRL.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.638
THE WHOLE WORLD'S GONNA BE
AT YOUR FEET.

00:46.147 --> 00:50.050
[camera shutter snapping]

00:53.754 --> 00:57.291
- EXCUSE ME.

00:57.325 --> 01:00.128
OH, LIFE IS NOT THAT BAD.
GIVE ME A SMILE.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.764
YOU LOOK SO MUCH PRETTIER
WHEN YOU SMILE, DANIELLE.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.436
- [gasps and shouts]

01:09.437 --> 01:10.738
[whimpers]
- [moans]

01:10.771 --> 01:13.207
LOOK AT ME.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.675
NOW LOOK AT MY FACE.

01:14.708 --> 01:18.279
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT MY FACE.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.381
[echoing]
LOOK AT MY FACE.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.983
- MY FRIENDS WANTED ME
TO STAY FOR ANOTHER DRINK,

01:23.016 --> 01:27.521
BUT I HAVE A REHEARSAL
IN THE MORNING.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.090
I SHOULD HAVE JUST SMILED
WHEN HE ASKED.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.059
- YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.464
YOU SURVIVED.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.632
DANIELLE, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS MAN BEFORE?

01:38.666 --> 01:42.436
- NO.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.638
BUT HE KNEW
ALL ABOUT ME.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.174
- THERE ARE BIKE TRACKS.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.409
GET THE CEMENT.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.413
- WOW, HE REALLY GOT YOU GOOD,
HUH?

01:52.446 --> 01:55.649
- HE WAS WEARING
LATEX GLOVES.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.252
- DID HE HAVE ANY
DISTINGUISHING MARKS ON HIM,

01:58.286 --> 01:59.687
A TATTOO,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

01:59.720 --> 02:02.356
- I SAW ONE ON HIS NECK.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.957
A TAI CHI THING.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.428
- A TAI CHI THING?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.596
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT?

02:08.629 --> 02:12.566
- HALF BLACK,
HALF WHITE,

02:12.600 --> 02:13.734
IN A CIRCLE.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.002
- THE YIN-YANG?

02:15.035 --> 02:17.338
- YEAH.
SORRY.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.407
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU DURING THE INCIDENT?

02:22.776 --> 02:26.580
- HE SAID,
"TELL ME YOU LOVE ME, MOMMY."

02:26.614 --> 02:29.450
- THOSE EXACT WORDS?
YOU'RE SURE?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.619
- [sobs]

02:31.652 --> 02:35.088
- DID YOU NOTICE
HOW HE GOT AWAY?

02:35.122 --> 02:36.990
- ON A BIKE.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.592
- DANIELLE,

02:38.626 --> 02:41.329
WILL YOU EXCUSE US
FOR ONE SECOND, OKAY?

02:41.362 --> 02:44.232
DETECTIVE, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU?

02:44.265 --> 02:48.302
UH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO THINGS DOWN SOUTH,

02:48.336 --> 02:50.204
BUT HERE, IN NEW YORK,
WE THINK IT'S BEST

02:50.238 --> 02:51.739
IF ONE PERSON
DOES THE INTAKE

02:51.772 --> 02:53.407
AS TO NOT OVERWHELM
THE VICTIM.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.709
- OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW
THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY,

02:55.743 --> 02:57.311
BUT I THINK
I KNOW THIS GUY.

02:57.345 --> 02:59.046
I RECOGNIZE HIS M.O.
- RECOGNIZE HIM? FROM WHERE?

02:59.079 --> 03:00.281
YOU JUST GOT HERE.
- WE WERE TRACKING

03:00.314 --> 03:01.582
A SERIAL RAPIST IN GEORGIA.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.150
IT'S THE SAME SIGNATURE.
- OKAY.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.486
- OLIVIA, IT'S THE SAME
SIGNATURE--THE WAY HE STALKS,

03:05.519 --> 03:07.154
THE TATTOO--
- ROLLINS, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.589
THE CITY IS FILLED
WITH RAPISTS

03:08.622 --> 03:10.224
WITH THE SAME M.O.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.460
- "TELL ME YOU LOVE ME,
MOMMY"?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.595
I MEAN, HE SAID
THE EXACT SAME THING, OUR PERP.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.331
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT'S STILL A STRETCH.

03:17.365 --> 03:20.067
- COULD BE.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.103
COULD BE HE'S HERE.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.255
- WE CALLED HIM
THE ATLANTIC COAST RAPIST.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.190
THE WHITE MALE, 30s.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.427
- WITH A YIN-YANG TATTOO
ON HIS NECK.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.495
- MM-HMM.
YEAH, HE STRUCK IN GEORGIA,

04:21.529 --> 04:24.164
IN VIRGINIA,
MARYLAND.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.034
WE GAVE HIM THE NAME AT APD,
AND IT JUST KIND OF STUCK.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.570
HE'S A POWER REASSURANCE
SERIAL RAPIST.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.439
15 RAPES
OVER 9 YEARS.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.006
NOTHING IN THE LAST THREE.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.443
SO WE THOUGHT HE WAS EITHER
IN PRISON OR DEAD.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.144
UNTIL LAST NIGHT.

04:37.177 --> 04:40.514
NOW DETECTIVE BENSON
THINKS I'M REACHING,

04:40.548 --> 04:42.082
BUT, I MEAN,
FOLLOW ME HERE.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.517
THE VICTIMS ARE ALL YOUNG.
THEY'RE FIT, ATHLETIC,

04:43.551 --> 04:46.053
THE PLANTED BIKE IN THE WOODS.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.254
- A LOT OF PEOPLE
RIDE BIKES IN THE CITY.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.622
DELIVERYMEN,
MESSENGERS.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.190
- THIS GUY'S NEVER BEEN NORTH
OF CHARM CITY.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.992
HE JUMPS THE MASON-DIXON?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.193
- CAN WE HEAR HER OUT,
FELLAS?

04:53.226 --> 04:56.196
- OKAY, SO, WHAT, YOU THINKIN'
HE FOLLOWED YOU

04:56.229 --> 04:57.998
TO NEW YORK ON THE HEELS
OF YOUR MOVE?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.000
COULD HE BE TAUNTING YOU?
- NO.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.369
NO, THAT'S NOT HIS WAY.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.603
HE'S AVOIDED US
ALL THESE YEARS

05:02.636 --> 05:04.171
BY STAYING UNDER THE RADAR.

05:04.204 --> 05:05.272
- HOW ABOUT ANY MISTAKES?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.474
- YEAH, THE FIRST FOUR RAPES,

05:06.507 --> 05:07.475
HE DIDN'T WEAR A CONDOM.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.142
SO WE GOT HIS DNA.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.611
- WHAT, THERE'S NO MATCHES?
NOTHING ON CODIS?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.745
- LIKE I SAID,
UNDER THE RADAR,

05:11.779 --> 05:13.180
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER SLIP-UP.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.983
GAITHERSBURG,
MARYLAND.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.285
GOT A PARTIAL PRINT
ON A SCREWDRIVER

05:18.318 --> 05:20.588
LEFT AT THE SCENE
HALLOWEEN 2003.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.656
- WELL, HE LIKES BLONDES.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.392
- I'D CALL IT
AN OBSESSION.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.560
- DANIELLE HYNES
DID THE PERFECT THING.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.596
SHE PULLED OUT
HER ATTACKER'S HAIR,

05:28.629 --> 05:31.131
KEPT IT,
ROOTS AND ALL.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.065
- DID YOU GET A SKETCH?

05:32.099 --> 05:33.000
- CAPTAIN, HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.334
I BROUGHT IN FUJITA.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.669
- WHO'S THAT?
- FREELANCE.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.104
BEST SKETCH ARTIST
IN THE CITY.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.506
- FUJITA TAKES HOURS,
HE'S EXORBITANT.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.642
- WELL, THESE
AREN'T GONNA CATCH ANYONE.

05:41.675 --> 05:46.079
- EXCELLENT.
- BUT THESE WILL.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.983
- THERE'S HIS TATTOO.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.519
- WELL, LET'S GET THIS OUT,

05:51.552 --> 05:53.487
CALL ONE PP, WE GOT
A SERIAL RAPIST ON OUR HANDS.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.155
- WHOA, WHOA,
LET'S JUST HOLD ON HERE.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.290
NO NEED TO CAUSE A PANIC.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.659
LET'S GO WITH WHAT WE KNOW.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.994
PUT IT OUT, BUT JUST LINK HIM
TO LAST NIGHT'S ATTACK.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.531
WE KEEP THE REST
IN OUR POCKET FOR NOW.

06:03.564 --> 06:07.034
- WE HAVE LIFT-OFF.
THE SKETCH IS UP.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.103
- BIG BROTHER IS MOST DEFINITELY
WATCHING, AMIGO.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.239
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT?
THEY TAKE YOUR DNA AT BIRTH

06:12.272 --> 06:13.741
AND PUT IT
IN SOME GOVERNMENT DATABASE?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.509
- THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT SHOULD HAVE A PROBLEM

06:15.543 --> 06:16.677
WITH THAT
ARE CRIMINALS.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.178
- OR PEOPLE WHO CARE
ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.246
- WHAT I SAID.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.380
- YOU'RE MISSING
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.515
WHICH SCHMUCK ARE THEY GONNA GET

06:21.549 --> 06:24.184
TO MANAGE ALL THESE CALLS?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.219
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,
MRS. REIDY.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.055
NO, JUST LOCK
YOUR FRONT DOOR.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.591
NO, THAT'S NOT HIM.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.160
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A WHITE MAN.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.327
[sighs]

06:34.361 --> 06:35.463
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE
TAKE OVER FOR ME?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.664
I'M GONNA GO CHEW SOME GLASS.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.499
- HEY, MUNCH.
CHECK THESE OUT, WILLYA?

06:38.532 --> 06:39.667
- YOU ARE THE SERGEANT.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.401
- I GOT TWO COLDS
AND A CRAZY.

06:41.435 --> 06:45.038
- DETECTIVES...

06:47.040 --> 06:48.576
- WHEN WERE YOU ATTACKED,
LANA?

06:48.609 --> 06:52.145
- TWO MONTHS AGO
IN MORNINGSIDE PARK.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.549
I NEVER REPORTED IT.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.052
AND TODAY I SAW HIS FACE
ON THE NEWS AND...

06:59.086 --> 07:00.621
- AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS HIM?

07:00.654 --> 07:04.625
- THE TATTOO
ON HIS NECK.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.060
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU?

07:07.094 --> 07:10.731
ANYTHING SPECIFIC
THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER?

07:10.764 --> 07:14.167
- [sobbing]

07:14.201 --> 07:18.138
HE SAID, "LOOK AT ME.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.173
LOOK AT MY FACE."

07:20.207 --> 07:24.678
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE
TO YOU?

07:24.712 --> 07:27.047
- "TELL ME YOU LOVE ME,
MOMMY.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.516
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME."

07:28.549 --> 07:30.383
HE KEPT--
HE KEPT SAYING IT.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.086
[knock at door]

07:33.120 --> 07:36.023
- CELL PHONE IMAGE CAME IN
ON THE TIP LINE.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.226
RECOGNIZE HIM?

07:39.259 --> 07:42.229
- YEAH.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.264
- ANYONE ASKS,
I NEVER SHOWED THAT TO YOU.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.666
HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM?

07:45.699 --> 07:48.168
- HE STARTED COMING TO THE PARK
WITH HIS BOY THIS SUMMER.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.402
- DID YOU EVER TALK TO HIM?

07:49.436 --> 07:51.038
- HIS SON LUKE
PLAYS WITH MY DAUGHTER.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.272
- THEY LIVE AROUND HERE?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.107
- ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME

07:54.141 --> 07:56.209
OFF NINTH.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.047
- I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE CARS
IN ANTARCTICA.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.315
I THINK--I DON'T KNOW.
THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME TRUCKS.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.517
- EXCUSE ME.
- I THINK IT'D BE KIND OF HARD--

08:03.551 --> 08:06.153
YES?
- NYPD, MR., UH...

08:06.186 --> 08:08.522
- GABRIEL THOMAS.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.692
- CAN WE SPEAK TO YOU ALONE,
MR. THOMAS?

08:11.725 --> 08:12.993
- OH, OF COURSE.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.629
HEY, LUKE, GO IN
AND FIND MOM, OKAY?

08:15.663 --> 08:18.031
- OKAY.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.168
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.336
- YOU SEE THE PAPERS
THIS MORNING?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.606
- YES.
- LET ME GUESS. THE TIMES.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.576
YOU SHOULD READ
THE TABLOIDS.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.280
- WELL, THERE HAS TO BE
A MISTAKE.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.982
- HONEY?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.216
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.384
- WE'RE ASKING YOUR HUSBAND

08:37.417 --> 08:38.518
WHERE HE WAS TWO NIGHTS AGO.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.688
- HOME WITH HIS FAMILY.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.356
- ALL NIGHT.
- I WENT FOR A BIKE RIDE.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.226
AROUND 9:00,
AFTER I PUT MY SON TO SLEEP.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.427
- WAS ANYBODY
WITH YOU?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.196
- NO.
I RIDE ALONE.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.235
- LOOK, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS HERE.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.537
JUST COME DOWN TO THE STATION
WITH US,

08:57.571 --> 08:58.972
WE'LL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.
- I'M CALLING MY BROTHER.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.541
- JANEY, I DON'T NEED
A LAWYER.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.777
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.081
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
OKAY?

09:08.115 --> 09:11.184
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.058
- IF THAT'S YOUR GUY--
- THIS IS MY GUY.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.629
- WELL, HE'S PRETTY COOL.
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT A LAWYER.

09:21.662 --> 09:25.198
- OH, REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY
'CAUSE HE'S ALREADY GOT ONE.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.400
SHERRI WEST.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.543
- OKAY, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.646
FACE FORWARD.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.118
- COUNSELOR.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.987
GUESS THEY GAVE THE NEW GUY
THE SHORT STRAW.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.155
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO,
CAPTAIN.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.156
- LET'S GET THIS STARTED.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.958
WHERE'S YOUR VIC?
- TRY TWO.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.726
AND THAT'S JUST IN NEW YORK.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.962
YOU GET THIS GUY OFF,
YOU'RE WORTH THE MONEY

09:54.995 --> 09:56.063
THEY'RE THROWING AT YOU.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.965
- NUMBER FOUR, STEP FORWARD.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.367

10:00.400 --> 10:02.135
NUMBER FIVE,
STEP FORWARD.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.505
NUMBER FIVE.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.240
BACK.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.342
NUMBER SIX, STEP FORWARD.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.112
BACK.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.081
[five knocks]

10:14.114 --> 10:16.183
OKAY, ALL YOU GENTLEMEN
CAN LEAVE.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.584
PICK UP YOUR $10
DOWN THE HALL.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.452
NUMBER FIVE,
PLEASE STAY.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.554
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.456
- SHOULD HAVE STAYED DOWN SOUTH,
GABRIEL.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.993
YOUR GAME WASN'T READY
FOR THE BIG CITY.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.461
THOSE GIRLS YOU RAPED,

10:28.495 --> 10:30.664
THEY JUST MADE YOU,
BOTH OF 'EM.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.565
- WELL, THAT CAN'T BE.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.602
- YOU'RE DONE.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.748
- WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE,

10:47.781 --> 10:49.349
SO LET'S JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.751
- LOOK, I MAY BE NEW
TO DEFENSE,

10:50.784 --> 10:52.720
BUT EVEN A PARALEGAL KNOWS
NOT TO LET A CLIENT

10:52.753 --> 10:54.354
TALK TO COPS.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.488
- SO WHY ARE WE HERE,
COUNSELOR?

10:55.522 --> 10:56.623
- YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.226
- GEE, NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.660
- CUT ME A BREAK.
DID YOU SEE HIM IN THERE?

11:00.694 --> 11:03.030
- SAW THE LINE-UP.
THOSE WOMEN DIDN'T HESITATE.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.232
- YEAH, AND YOU KNOW HOW
UNRELIABLE EYE-WITNESSES ARE.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.466
GABRIEL'S A STRAIGHT ARROW.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.735
HE'S GOT A FAMILY,
A JOB.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.737
- THAT WAS MY TAKE ON HIM.
SO LET US GET HIS SIDE.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.706
- I'D LOVE TO TAKE
THE CONFESSION.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.341
- LOOK, IF YOU GO IN THERE
WITH YOUR MIND ALREADY MADE UP,

11:14.374 --> 11:16.376
I WILL ADVISE HIM
TO SHUT UP.

11:17.778 --> 11:20.247
- COULD WE HAVE THE ROOM
FOR A SECOND?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.749
THANK YOU.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.556
- IT'S HIM.
HE FITS THE PROFILE TO A "T."

11:29.589 --> 11:30.623
- YOU HEAR YOURSELF, ROLLINS?

11:30.657 --> 11:32.059
LOOK, WE NEED TO GO
IN THERE

11:32.092 --> 11:33.526
LOOKING FOR REASONS
TO EXCLUDE HIM,

11:33.560 --> 11:34.995
NOT TO FIND HIM GUILTY.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.596
- HE IS GUILTY.
I MEAN, WHAT--

11:36.629 --> 11:38.365
WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON?

11:38.398 --> 11:39.499
- HOW ABOUT THE DNA?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.533
AND THE FINGERPRINT

11:40.567 --> 11:41.735
ON THAT SCREWDRIVER.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.203
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT BELONGS TO.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.237
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
SO WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT,

11:44.271 --> 11:45.572
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE MY SHOT?

11:45.605 --> 11:46.639
- YOU HOLD ON.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.742
BENSON, AMARO,

11:48.776 --> 11:51.278
YOU TAKE THE LEAD.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.015
ROLLINS, YOU WATCH WITH ME.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.651
- YES, SIR.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.126
- LET'S--
LET'S JUST TRY THIS AGAIN.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.727
I AM--
I'M A GOOD CITIZEN.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.562
THE ONLY TROUBLE
I'VE EVER HAD

12:09.596 --> 12:11.064
IS A SPEEDING TICKET.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.733
- REALLY? 'CAUSE THERE'S
A DOMESTIC ASSAULT COMPLAINT

12:13.767 --> 12:15.502
AGAINST YOU IN 1994.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.736
- ARE YOU--

12:16.770 --> 12:17.704
I HAD--I HAD AN ARGUMENT

12:17.737 --> 12:20.573
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND
IN COLLEGE.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.275
AND HER ROOMMATE
CALLED THE COPS.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.178
THAT--IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.479
I WAS A KID.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.648
I WOULD LIKE
TO GO THROUGH YOUR LIVES.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.716
- OKAY,
WHY DON'T WE CALM DOWN?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.084
OKAY?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.419
SO WHAT LINE OF WORK
ARE YOU IN?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.720
- I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL REP.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.655
I'VE WORKED FOR THE SAME COMPANY
FOR TEN YEARS.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.624
JUST GOT A PROMOTION.
THAT'S WHY I MOVED HERE

12:37.657 --> 12:39.026
TO NEW YORK IN JUNE.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.493
- SO LET'S GO BACK
TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.730
NOW, YOU TOLD US THAT YOU
WERE BICYCLING ALONE?

12:43.763 --> 12:44.731
- AS I ALWAYS DO.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.366
- ANY WAY
THAT YOU CAN PROVE THAT?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.001
MAYBE YOU STOPPED BY
AT A BODEGA,

12:48.035 --> 12:49.169
USED AN ATM?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.670
- NO, I NEVER TAKE MY WALLET
WHEN I BIKE--

12:50.703 --> 12:52.005
JUST MY CASH, KEYS,
AND MY BAG.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.141
- WHAT ABOUT A THURSDAY NIGHT,
JULY 21st?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.742
WERE YOU IN THE CITY?
- I WAS PROBABLY HOME,

12:55.775 --> 12:57.110
WATCHING TV.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.578
- I TAKE IT MY CLIENT
WAS IN NEW YORK CITY

12:58.611 --> 13:00.113
THE NIGHT BOTH RAPES OCCURRED.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.482
SO WERE FOUR MILLION OTHER MEN.
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.351
THERE'S LOTS OF GUYS
IN NEW YORK.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.753
SO LET'S GO BACK
A LITTLE FURTHER.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.088
WHERE'D YOU MOVE HERE FROM?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.090
- GENEVA.
THAT'S MY COMPANY'S HOME OFFICE.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.559
- SO YOU WERE IN SWITZERLAND
THE PAST TEN YEARS.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.094
- NO, JUST FOR THE PAST THREE.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.229
BEFORE THAT
I WAS A SALES REP.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.365
GEORGIA, SOUTH CAROLINA,
MARYLAND.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.972
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.706
- ANY CHANCE WE COULD GET
YOUR EMPLOYMENT RECORDS

13:26.739 --> 13:27.707
FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.209
I MEAN, CITIES, DATES.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.710
- THAT'S A PRETTY WIDE NET
YOU'RE CASTING.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.145
- NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S FINE.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.613
NO, YOU TAKE ANYTHING
THAT YOU NEED.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.149
- WELL, WE APPRECIATE THAT.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.351
- ALL RIGHT.
SO CAN I GO HOME NOW?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.187
MY WIFE'S PROBABLY
OUT OF HER MIND.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.454
SHE'S HOME ALONE
WITH OUR SIX-YEAR-OLD.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.492
- WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE,
YOU CAN CALL HER.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.960
- NICE WORK.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.962
Y'ALL PUT HIM IN EVERY STATE
A RAPE WAS REPORTED.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.030
- NO, WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.032
HE PUT HIMSELF THERE.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.202
- WE GAVE HIM
EVERY OPPORTUNITY

13:55.235 --> 13:57.037
TO EXCLUDE HIMSELF.
HE COULDN'T.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.371
- HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE OBSESSED WITH BLONDES?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.407
HE BARELY EVEN NOTICED YOU,
ROLLINS.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.375
- NO, HE LIKES SUBMISSIVES.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.510
WE GOT HIM.
THIS IS OUR GUY.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.677
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.513
HE VOLUNTEERED
HIS WORK RECORDS.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.516
CONNECT THE DOTS.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.184
- SO THE RED LIGHTS ARE ATTACKS.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.621
AND THESE BLUE LIGHTS HERE, THEY
INDICATE GABRIEL THOMAS'S HOMES

14:14.654 --> 14:15.688
OVER THE SAME PERIOD.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.024
ANYONE GOT THE ODDS
ON THAT?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.059
- AND THERE'S MORE.
IN 2002,

14:19.092 --> 14:20.160
HE WAS TRANSFERRED
TO MARYLAND.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.495
THE NEXT YEAR
HE STRUCK THREE TIMES

14:22.529 --> 14:23.964
IN GAITHERSBURG.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.666
SOUTH CAROLINA,
VIRGINIA, GEORGIA.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.667
SAME PATTERN.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.969
- AND NO RAPES
THE THREE YEARS

14:29.002 --> 14:30.503
HE WAS IN SWITZERLAND.
- RIGHT.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.339
COINCIDING WITH THE GAP
IN THE SPREE.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.207
- SWITZERLAND.
THERE'S A LOT OF BLONDES THERE.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.509
ANY CRIMES FIT HIS M.O.
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD?

14:36.543 --> 14:38.211
- WE GOT A WIRE OUT
TO INTERPOL.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.512
DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.216
- ANYWAY, BUT HE REPATRIATES
JUNE 1st TO NEW YORK.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.052
THEN THERE'S TWO RAPES
IN THREE MONTHS.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.586
- YOU GUYS GET ANYTHING
OFF THE WARRANT?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.622
- CSU PICKED UP
A SCREWDRIVER AND A KNIFE

14:49.656 --> 14:50.723
IN HIS BIKE BAG.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.359
AGAIN, FITTING HIS M.O.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.728
- AND MATCHING THE CONTENTS
OF EVERY CYCLIST'S BIKE BAG.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.365
- LOOK, I GET IT.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.368
HIS LIFE DOVETAILS
WITH THE RAPIST'S,

15:01.401 --> 15:04.237
BUT DOES ANYONE THINK IT'S WEIRD
HE JUST OFFERED ALL THAT UP?

15:04.271 --> 15:06.039
- IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THIS?
[cell phone buzzes]

15:06.073 --> 15:07.574
- LISTEN TO THIS.

15:07.607 --> 15:11.511
LAB REPORT:
GABRIEL THOMAS IS A DNA MATCH

15:11.544 --> 15:14.081
FOR THE RAPE KITS
FOR THE FIRST FOUR VICTIMS

15:14.114 --> 15:15.415
AND DANIELLE HYNES.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.616
- CHECKMATE.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.351
BOOK HIM.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.487
I WISH
THEY WERE ALL THIS EASY.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.689
- I'M GONNA CALL MY CAPTAIN
IN ATLANTA,

15:22.722 --> 15:24.091
TELL HIM THE GOOD NEWS.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.459
- HEY, ROLLINS.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.594
- YEAH.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.329
- NICE JOB.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.580
- THE DNA RESULTS
ARE WRONG.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.017
I WORK
FOR A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.451
LABS MAKE MISTAKES
ALL THE TIME.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.186
- THE THING IS,
DNA DOESN'T LIE.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.655
- NEITHER DO I.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.660
- [whistles]
HEY.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.695
[latch clicks]

16:08.668 --> 16:10.670
- IT ISN'T ME.

16:10.703 --> 16:14.441
- LISTEN,
YOU'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT HERE.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.510
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME, HMM?

16:17.544 --> 16:20.647
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T WANT
YOUR WIFE TO KNOW?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.149
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SAY

16:22.182 --> 16:24.517
IN FRONT
OF THAT PRETTY ATTORNEY?

16:24.551 --> 16:27.287
- NO.
NOTHING.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.122
- LIKE, WITH THESE WOMEN
IN NEW YORK.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.291
LOOK, I-I SAW THEM.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.493
AND THEY SENT MIXED SIGNALS?
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

16:33.526 --> 16:35.728
- HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?

16:35.762 --> 16:38.998
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.404
- OKAY.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.507
[clears throat]

16:47.540 --> 16:50.343
YOU GOT A SON, RIGHT?
LUKE?

16:50.377 --> 16:51.711
- YES.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.346
- WHAT IS HE, SIX, SEVEN?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.648
- SIX.
- [chuckles]

16:55.682 --> 16:59.752
YEAH, I GOT
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.188
AND THEY GROW UP FAST.

17:01.221 --> 17:04.524
AND PRETTY SOON,
IT'S HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION,

17:04.557 --> 17:07.227
THEN COLLEGE.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.663
I MEAN, YOU WANT
TO SEE LUKE EVER AGAIN, GABRIEL?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.601
LOOK, YOU COME CLEAN
RIGHT NOW,

17:14.634 --> 17:16.736
AND I'LL MAKE SURE YOU DO
YOUR TIME IN NEW YORK,

17:16.769 --> 17:19.038
FULL VISITATION.
YOU WANT TO HUG YOUR SON?

17:19.072 --> 17:22.275
AND YOU WANT TO SEE HIM
GROW UP?

17:22.309 --> 17:24.111
'CAUSE YOU GET SENT
OUT OF STATE,

17:24.144 --> 17:25.178
THAT'S A LONG TRIP
FOR YOUR WIFE AND BOY TO MAKE.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.280
- MY WIFE LOVES ME.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.517
SHE KNOWS
I WOULD NEVER DO THIS.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.319
- LOOK, GABRIEL,

17:32.352 --> 17:35.122
UP TO NOW I'VE GIVEN YOU
EVERY CHANCE I CAN,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.590
BUT YOU'RE NOT HELPING YOURSELF.
TURN AROUND.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.127
- I WON'T ADMIT TO SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.262
AND I'LL TELL YOU
ANOTHER THING, DETECTIVE.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.663
- YEAH, WHAT'S THAT?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.732
- YOUR RAPIST
IS STILL OUT THERE.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.736
[latch clicks]

17:49.769 --> 17:50.770
- LET'S GO.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.007
- HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT PLEA?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.376
- NOT GUILTY.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.145
- MS. WEST, I REALIZE
YOU'RE NEW TO THE DEFENSE SIDE,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.180
BUT LET'S FOLLOW PROTOCOL.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.648
- NOT GUILTY,
YOUR HONOR.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.682
- PEOPLE ON BAIL?

18:02.715 --> 18:04.050
- REMAND, YOUR HONOR.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.652
THE DEFENDANT IS FACING TRIAL

18:05.685 --> 18:07.254
FOR TWO COUNTS
OF FORCIBLE RAPE

18:07.287 --> 18:08.255
IN NEW YORK,
AND OTHER STATES

18:08.288 --> 18:09.722
ARE PREPARING ARREST WARRANTS

18:09.756 --> 18:11.724
AND EXTRADITION REQUESTS
FOR RAPES

18:11.758 --> 18:13.693
IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.495
AND DNA EVIDENCE
FROM FOUR SEPARATE LABS

18:15.528 --> 18:16.729
CONFIRMS
HE'S BEEN TERRORIZING WOMEN

18:16.763 --> 18:19.199
FOR YEARS
WITH IMPUNITY.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.168
HE HAS A MOTIVE TO FLEE
AND THE MEANS TO DO SO.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.603
- YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT
IS A LOVING FAMILY MAN

18:23.636 --> 18:25.272
WITH A STABLE JOB
AND NO PRIOR CONVICTIONS.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.175
THE POLICE AND THE D.A.'S OFFICE
ARE RUSHING TO JUDGE--

18:28.208 --> 18:31.611
- PLEASE, MS. WEST,
YOU KNOW BETTER.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.746
GIVEN THE NATURE
AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CRIMES

18:33.780 --> 18:36.416
HE'S CHARGED WITH,
THE DEFENDANT IS TO BE REMANDED

18:36.449 --> 18:38.585
TO RIKERS.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.621
- JANEY.
- BAILIFF!

18:41.654 --> 18:45.625
- JANEY, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I DID THIS.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.495
JANEY!

18:48.528 --> 18:51.231
- ALL RIGHT,
SIGN HERE, GUY.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.566
HOLD YOUR PEN HERE.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.002
ONCE THAT PIECE OF GARBAGE
IS PROCESSED,

18:56.035 --> 18:58.538
TRANSPORT WILL BE MADE
TO RIKERS.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.740
- THANK GOD
THIS LOCKOUT ENDED, HUH?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.675
- AMEN TO THAT.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.511
GIANTS GOT A NICE GROUP
OF RECEIVERS.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.146
- STARTS UP FRONT.
GOT TO WIN THE WAR

19:07.180 --> 19:08.281
IN THE TRENCHES FIRST--
- BLEEDER!

19:08.315 --> 19:09.382
WE GOT A BLEEDER, DETECTIVES.
YOUR GUY.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.517
- CALL THE BUS.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.987
SOMEBODY GET A MEDIC!

19:15.021 --> 19:16.556
- GABRIEL, HEY, HEY.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.657
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.326
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.160
ALL RIGHT, JUST RELAX.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU SOME HELP.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.263
ALL RIGHT?

19:23.296 --> 19:25.598
- YOU TELL MY BOY

19:25.632 --> 19:28.201
I NEVER RAPED ANYBODY.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.739
YOU TELL HIM THAT
FOR ME.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.777
- GET A MEDIC
IN HERE NOW!

19:44.451 --> 19:45.418
- I HAVEN'T DONE
A FULL PSYCH EVAL.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.719
HE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

19:46.753 --> 19:47.720
- OKAY, BUT HOW MANY TIMES

19:47.754 --> 19:49.222
HAVE WE SEEN THIS?

19:49.256 --> 19:50.590
I MEAN,
A GUY FINALLY GETS CAUGHT

19:50.623 --> 19:52.425
AND HE TAKES THE EASY WAY OUT.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.693
- WHAT'D YOU TELL LUKE?

19:53.726 --> 19:56.028
- THAT YOU WERE
ON A BUSINESS TRIP

19:56.062 --> 19:58.565
FOR A LONG TIME.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.233
- KIDS AT SCHOOL,
PARENTS ARE GONNA TALK.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.602
- I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
TO THE HEADMASTER.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.638
THEY'RE AWARE
OF THE SITUATION.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.575
[metal bangs]

20:08.608 --> 20:12.412
- HOW COULD YOU BELIEVE
I COULD DO THIS?

20:12.445 --> 20:14.347
- I'M SORRY.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.317
I JUST...

20:19.752 --> 20:21.120
- DOC, I HAVE TO ASK,

20:21.153 --> 20:22.422
IS THERE ANY WAY GABRIEL

20:22.455 --> 20:23.556
COULD COMMIT ALL THESE CRIMES

20:23.590 --> 20:24.757
AND HAVE NO AWARENESS
OF IT?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.159
- I'M HERE 20 YEARS,
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.462
THERE ARE PSYCHIATRISTS
WHO WILL SAY YES,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.664
AND THOSE ARE THE ONES
HIS LAWYER WILL HIRE

20:31.698 --> 20:33.333
WHEN THEY TRY
TO GET HIM OFF.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.302
- HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYONE
ATTEMPT SUICIDE

20:35.335 --> 20:36.736
TO BOLSTER AN INSANITY DEFENSE?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.605
- I HAD A GUY TRY
TO CHEW HIS ARM OFF

20:38.638 --> 20:40.440
TO CONVINCE A JURY
HE WAS CRAZY.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.575
IT WORKED.
[door opens]

20:43.643 --> 20:45.478
- JANEY.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.080
JANEY, THE DOCTOR SAYS
THAT HE'S GOING

20:48.114 --> 20:49.449
TO BE OKAY.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.451
- PLEASE DON'T PRETEND
YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.053
- OKAY.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.458
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:58.491 --> 21:04.130
I WAS MARRIED
TO SOMEONE FOR 15 YEARS,

21:04.163 --> 21:05.264
HAD A CHILD WITH HIM,

21:05.298 --> 21:07.600
AND I DIDN'T SEE
ONE SIGN OF THIS.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.537
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

21:10.570 --> 21:13.740
- THE TRUE PREDATORS,
THE ONES THAT GET AWAY WITH IT,

21:13.773 --> 21:17.544
THEY'RE--THEY'RE MASTERFUL
AT THIS.

21:17.577 --> 21:21.047
- BUT ALL THIS TIME?

21:21.080 --> 21:24.250
WHAT HE DID TO THOSE WOMEN
IS...

21:24.283 --> 21:26.185
IT MAKES ME SICK.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.387
- BUT YOU'RE HERE.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.488
IN SPITE OF IT.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.656
- MY MOM WANTS ME
TO CUT HIM LOOSE,

21:29.689 --> 21:32.191
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYONE ELSE.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.360
- GABRIEL DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FAMILY?

21:33.393 --> 21:35.562
- NO.
HE WAS AN ONLY CHILD,

21:35.595 --> 21:37.397
AND HIS PARENTS DIED
WITHIN SIX MONTHS

21:37.430 --> 21:38.431
OF EACH OTHER
WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.633
- THAT'S QUITE A TRAUMA.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.268
HOW DID HE DEAL WITH THAT?

21:42.301 --> 21:46.305
- PRETTY WELL,
I THOUGHT.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.007
SAME WAY HE HANDLED
OUR MISCARRIAGE.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.709
HE SAID
IT WAS JUST NATURE'S WAY

21:49.742 --> 21:53.580
OF SAYING
IT WASN'T THE RIGHT TIME.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.982
HE NEVER LEFT MY SIDE
THAT WHOLE WEEKEND.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.386
NOT EVEN TO WASH
THE STUPID MAKEUP OFF HIS FACE.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.554
- MAKEUP?

22:01.588 --> 22:06.593
- WE HAD ON PIRATE COSTUMES.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.496
HALLOWEEN PARTY.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.364
GABE HAD ON EYELINER
LIKE CAPTAIN JACK.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.332
WHEN HE CRIED,
IT RAN.

22:13.366 --> 22:16.302
- HALLOWEEN?
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YEAR?

22:17.504 --> 22:20.339
- 2003.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.012
- COUNSELOR.

22:26.045 --> 22:29.115
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THIS IDEA.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.284
WHAT IF SOMEBODY DESIGNED
A PLACE WHERE YOU SIT DOWN

22:32.318 --> 22:34.487
AND ANOTHER PERSON
BRINGS YOU FOOD.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.755
YOU THINK
THAT COULD CATCH ON?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.524
- WHAT DO YOU WANT,
NICK?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.959
- YOUR ALTERNATE THEORY
OF THE CRIME.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.528
AND I KNOW
YOU MUST HAVE ONE.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.595
- DON'T BUST MY BALLS.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.064
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET YOU TALK
TO HIM.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.233
- EXCEPT, AT THE TIME,
YOU BELIEVED HIM.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.468
- ARE WE DONE GLOATING YET?

22:48.501 --> 22:52.505
- LOOK, SHERRI,
I HAVE A FEW LOOSE ENDS.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.542
MY CAPTAIN THINKS
THIS CASE IS CLOSED.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.109
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK
INTO SOME DATES

22:57.143 --> 22:58.578
FOR YOUR CLIENT.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.547
HALLOWEEN WEEKEND,
2003.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.415
- IT WAS RAPE NUMBER FOUR
IN GAITHERSBURG.

23:02.449 --> 23:03.683
HIS DNA WAS ALL OVER THAT ONE.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.017
WHAT'S THERE TO LOOK FOR?

23:05.051 --> 23:09.055
- A MAN IN TWO PLACES
AT THE SAME TIME.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.636
- WHAT'S BUGGING YOU,
NEW GUY?

23:23.670 --> 23:27.507
- HMM?
NOTHING.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.742
- SUIT YOURSELF.

23:29.776 --> 23:33.012
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE FOUND GABE

23:33.045 --> 23:34.514
IN HIS CELL,

23:34.547 --> 23:36.583
JUST BLOOD EVERYWHERE,

23:36.616 --> 23:39.085
HE SAID TO ME,

23:39.118 --> 23:42.589
"TELL MY SON
I DIDN'T DO THIS."

23:42.622 --> 23:45.525
- LAST WORDS
OF A DYING MAN THING.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.528
- NAH.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.196
I KNOW HE'S GUILTY.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.598
I MEAN, WE GOT THIS GUY
DEAD TO RIGHTS,

23:51.631 --> 23:53.566
BUT...

23:53.600 --> 23:56.736
HIS AFFECT...

23:56.769 --> 23:59.472
IT JUST BUGS ME THAT,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

23:59.506 --> 24:03.075
A GUY COULD PLAY ME LIKE THAT.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.578
- ARE YOU SURE THAT'S ALL
THAT'S BUGGING YOU?

24:09.381 --> 24:11.117
- WE HAVE HIS DNA.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.151
- BACK WHEN I GOT MY SHIELD,

24:12.184 --> 24:13.553
ALL WE HAD TO GO ON

24:13.586 --> 24:16.022
WAS BLOOD TYPE AND FINGERPRINTS.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.691
WE WENT WITH OUR GUT.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.292
YOU KNOW WHAT, KID?

24:20.326 --> 24:23.262
I MISS THOSE DAYS.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.971
- FIVE SEPARATE CRIME SCENES
ALL A MATCH

24:32.004 --> 24:33.205
FOR THE SAME PERP.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.341
I KNOW,
BUT IS THERE ANY CHANCE

24:35.374 --> 24:36.609
YOU GOT IT WRONG?

24:36.643 --> 24:40.479
- THE ODDS OF MATCHING
400 BASE PAIRS AT 13 LOCI,

24:40.513 --> 24:43.182
WHICH WE HAVE IN THIS CASE,
FROM TWO RANDOM STRANGERS,

24:43.215 --> 24:44.751
ARE SO ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.619
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THAT MANY
PEOPLE EVER BORN ON THE PLANET.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.487
- THERE WAS A SCANDAL

24:48.521 --> 24:51.490
IN THE NASSAU COUNTY LAB
RECENTLY AND VIRGINIA.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.425
EVIDENCE TAMPERING
TO RAISE CONVICTION RATES,

24:53.459 --> 24:54.527
PAD THE STATS.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.562
- SO YOU'RE SAYING

24:55.595 --> 24:57.096
ALL FOUR OF THESE LABS
AND OUR LAB,

24:57.129 --> 25:00.366
THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY,
CONSPIRED TO TAKE GABRIEL DOWN.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.602
YOU GOT A MOTIVE?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.544
- OLIVIA SAYS
YOU HAVE SOMETHING, AMARO?

25:11.578 --> 25:13.245
- MAYBE.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.616
IT'S A VICTIM'S REPORT
FROM HALLOWEEN NIGHT, 2003.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.451
LOOK, SHE STATES HER RAPIST
HAD A CHIPPED TOOTH

25:19.485 --> 25:20.987
AND A LONG ABDOMINAL SCAR.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.623
GABRIEL THOMAS
HAS PERFECT TEETH, NO SCAR.

25:23.656 --> 25:26.358
- VICTIM ALSO DESCRIBES
A YIN-YANG TATTOO,

25:26.392 --> 25:27.694
WHICH GABRIEL DOES HAVE.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.662
SCARS GET REMOVED,
TEETH FIXED.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.298
- EXCEPT, THAT NIGHT,
GABRIEL WAS 100 MILES AWAY

25:32.331 --> 25:33.566
AT JOHNS HOPKINS.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.634
HIS WIFE MISCARRIED.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.036
TWO SWORN AFFIDAVITS--

25:37.069 --> 25:39.505
ONE FROM A DOCTOR, ONE
FROM GABRIEL'S MOTHER-IN-LAW--

25:39.538 --> 25:41.574
BOTH CLAIM HE NEVER LEFT
JANEY'S BEDSIDE

25:41.608 --> 25:42.575
THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.577
- DOCTOR WASN'T THERE 24/7.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.213
AND MOTHER-IN-LAWS
HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LIE.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.215
- THIS ONE NEVER LIKED HIM.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.417
- SOMEONE COULD HAVE PLANTED
HIS DNA.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.552
- REALLY? AND JUST STOPPED
AFTER THE FOURTH TIME?

26:00.159 --> 26:01.594
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE FAMILY?

26:01.628 --> 26:04.530
- LET'S ASK HIM.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.133
[knock at door]

26:07.166 --> 26:09.501
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:11.604 --> 26:14.206
- UH, BENSON AND AMARO

26:14.240 --> 26:15.241
ARE DOTTING SOME "I"s.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.443
I'LL FILL YOU IN.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.382
- NO, I WAS AN ONLY CHILD
AS FAR AS I KNOW.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.416
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

26:24.450 --> 26:26.518
- I WAS ADOPTED.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.157
- HAVE YOU EVER CONTACTED

26:31.190 --> 26:32.558
YOUR BIOLOGICAL MOTHER?

26:32.591 --> 26:35.161
- I WAS NEVER INTERESTED.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.964
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME THAT FOR?

26:37.997 --> 26:39.531
WHAT...

26:39.565 --> 26:41.133
DON'T FIT THE PROFILE,

26:41.167 --> 26:42.434
SO YOU'RE...
[sighs]

26:42.468 --> 26:43.970
TRYING TO BLAME THE FACT
THAT I WAS ADOPTED.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.438
YOU KNOW...

26:46.472 --> 26:47.606
SCREW YOU.

26:47.640 --> 26:51.443
MY PARENTS WERE GREAT PEOPLE.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.713
I WAS RAISED RIGHT.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.988
- IT WAS 1975, 1976.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.056
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.557
I WAS 17.

27:05.591 --> 27:06.558
COULDN'T LOOK AFTER MYSELF,

27:06.592 --> 27:10.262
LET ALONE TWO BABIES,
SO...

27:10.296 --> 27:11.664
I GAVE 'EM UP.

27:11.698 --> 27:14.500
- TWO BABIES?
SO TWIN BOYS?

27:14.533 --> 27:16.535
- YOU DON'T MISS A THING,
DO YOU?

27:16.568 --> 27:20.172
- DID THEY GO
TO THE SAME HOME?

27:20.206 --> 27:21.340
- NO.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.409
BACK THEN,
YOU KNOW,

27:23.442 --> 27:26.045
THEY SEPARATED IDENTICALS.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.479
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
SOME CRAZY EXPERIMENT.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.315
THEY PAID ME GOOD, THOUGH.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.549
- HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
FROM YOUR SONS?

27:30.582 --> 27:33.619
- ONE OF 'EM.
BRIAN.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.588
GOOD-LOOKING KID.
CAME TO VISIT ME...

27:38.124 --> 27:40.026
MAYBE 20 YEARS AGO.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.728
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE WE COULD FIND BRIAN?

27:41.761 --> 27:46.565
- THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.500
READ ABOUT HIM IN THE PAPER
THE NEXT YEAR, THOUGH.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.635
HE HAD IT TOUGH.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.170
- WAIT, WHY WAS HE
IN THE PAPER?

27:51.203 --> 27:54.073
- HIS PARENTS--
WELL, HIS ADOPTED PARENTS.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.443
THE MOTHER KILLED THE FATHER.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.411
SHE WAS JEALOUS.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.546
SO SHE DRUGGED HIM,

28:00.579 --> 28:05.317
THEN SHE BURNED HIM UP
IN FRONT OF BRIAN.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.453
POOR KID HAD TO TESTIFY.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.554
- DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THIS HAPPENED?

28:08.587 --> 28:10.522
- RICHMOND.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.192
NORFOLK.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.028
- UH-HUH. OKAY, AND THAT
WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW BRIAN?

28:16.062 --> 28:19.231
- OH, HE CAME TO SEE ME AGAIN
A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THE TRIAL.

28:19.265 --> 28:22.068
WANTED ME TO BE IN HIS LIFE.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.602
LIKE, WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

28:23.635 --> 28:26.238
TAKE HIM TO ARTHUR TREACHER'S,
THE MOVIES?

28:26.272 --> 28:28.374
I GAVE HIM UP ONCE.
HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE HINT.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.575
ARE WE DONE?
'CAUSE I NEED TO USE--

28:29.608 --> 28:30.743
- JUST ONE MORE THING.
DID YOU EVER TELL BRIAN

28:30.777 --> 28:32.078
HE HAD A TWIN?

28:32.111 --> 28:33.679
- YEAH, I TOLD HIM.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.247
AND HE GOES ON AND ON

28:35.281 --> 28:38.184
ABOUT HOW HE ALWAYS KNEW
SOMETHING WAS MISSING.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.519
JEEZ, YOU COULD HEAR
THE VIOLINS.

28:45.657 --> 28:49.428
- 1992, RICHMOND, CATHERINE
SMITH GETS THE DEATH PENALTY

28:49.461 --> 28:50.562
FOR MURDERING HER HUSBAND.

28:50.596 --> 28:51.730
- "THE JURY WATCHED IN HORROR

28:51.764 --> 28:54.300
"AS THEIR TEENAGE SON BRIAN

28:54.333 --> 28:56.668
GAVE CHILLING TESTIMONY
ABOUT THE BRUTAL MURDER."

28:56.702 --> 28:58.270
- SO WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A BRIAN SMITH.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.438
- I'M ALREADY ON IT.

28:59.471 --> 29:00.739
- YEAH, WELL,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.474
WHAT'S THERE, LIKE,
10,000 PEOPLE NAMED BRIAN SMITH

29:02.508 --> 29:04.010
IN THE UNITED STATES?

29:04.043 --> 29:05.577
- BUT HOW MANY OF THEM FOLLOW
THEIR TWIN TO NEW YORK?

29:05.611 --> 29:10.049
- THERE ARE 126 BRIAN SMITHS
IN NEW YORK CITY.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.250
- BUT THEY'RE TWINS, GUYS.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.318
LET'S LOOK
AT THEIR BIRTHDATES.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.354
- OKAY, FEBRUARY 6th, 1975.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.127
BRIAN SMITH STARTED
AS A PROVISIONAL

29:21.160 --> 29:22.561
FOR THE PARKS DEPARTMENT

29:22.594 --> 29:26.432
JULY OF THIS YEAR.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.635
- SON OF A BITCH.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.672
- LET'S GO PICK HIM UP.
- HOLD ON.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.308
LET'S BRING THE D.A.
UP TO SPEED.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.244
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES HERE.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.053
- YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.988
- THIS IS STILL A WIN.
SAME DNA.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.256
SAME I.D.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.991
- FOR TWO DIFFERENT SUSPECTS.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.225
RIGHT?
WHO ARE TWINS.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.495
THIS IS THE DEFINITION
OF REASONABLE DOUBT.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.530
WHY DIDN'T GABRIEL
BRING THIS UP?

29:58.564 --> 29:59.598
- HE DIDN'T KNOW.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.101
- IT'S BEEN BRIAN'S PLAN
FROM THE START.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.669
HE TRACKED GABRIEL CITY TO CITY.

30:03.702 --> 30:06.105
HE KNEW, IF HE EVER GOT CAUGHT,
HE COULD PUT IT ON HIS TWIN.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.340
- WELL, IT IS
A VERY GOOD PLAN.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.476
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
A JURY CAN TELL THEM APART.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.479
- WELL, HOW ABOUT
IF WE CAUGHT BRIAN IN THE ACT?

30:13.512 --> 30:16.015
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT,
CAPTAIN?

30:16.048 --> 30:18.450
- THIS GUY,
HE HAS SELF-CONTROL.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.386
HE WON'T STRIKE
WHILE HIS BROTHER'S IN PRISON.

30:20.419 --> 30:23.655
- WHAT IF WE LET HIM THINK
GABRIEL'S OUT?

30:23.689 --> 30:25.992
- AND TERRORIZE THE WHOLE CITY?

30:26.025 --> 30:28.360
- WE SET A TRAP.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.402
HE DOES LIKE BLONDES.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.372
- ON FURTHER CONSIDERATION,
THE COURT AGREES

30:40.406 --> 30:44.510
TO RELEASE GABRIEL THOMAS
FOR THE SUM OF $250,000.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.313
YOU'RE CONFINED
TO THE NEW YORK CITY BORDERS,

30:47.346 --> 30:49.681
AND YOU MUST CONTINUE
PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT.

30:49.715 --> 30:54.353
YOUR NEXT HEARING
WILL BE OCTOBER 6th.

30:58.290 --> 31:01.227
- THE PUBLIC IS OUTRAGED
AT YOUR RELEASE.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.529
HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR FREEDOM?

31:03.562 --> 31:07.066
- IF YOU SET ME FREE,
WHY AREN'T I HOME?

31:07.099 --> 31:11.503
OR SHOULD I EVEN BOTHER ASKING?

31:11.537 --> 31:14.640
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
A CRAZY RIDE.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.675
- CRA--
- BUT YOU'LL KNOW EVERYTHING

31:16.708 --> 31:18.144
ONCE WE HAVE IT SORTED OUT.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.546
- WHAT KIND OF GAME
ARE YOU PLAYIN'?

31:20.579 --> 31:23.749
JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

31:23.782 --> 31:25.117
- CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT?

31:25.151 --> 31:27.253
- MY ATTORNEY
WON'T EVEN TELL ME.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.088
- SIT TIGHT, GABE.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.123
- OH, DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

31:37.163 --> 31:39.131
- ANYBODY GOT EYES ON HIM?

31:39.165 --> 31:42.634
- HE'S STILL SWEEPING.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.603
- OH, HE'S BEEN WATCHING YOU
FOR FOUR DAYS.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.239
AND ALL BRIAN'S DONE
IS SNAP A FEW PICTURES.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.608
MAYBE YOU AREN'T HIS TYPE
AFTER ALL.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.643
- COME ON.
HE HASN'T TAKEN HIS EYES

31:51.677 --> 31:53.412
OFF ME
SINCE I STEPPED INTO THE PARK.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.747
- WAIT A MINUTE,
HOLD UP, HE'S ON THE MOVE.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.216
- WHERE?

31:57.249 --> 31:58.550
- I GOT HIM TOO.

31:58.584 --> 31:59.685
HEADING NORTH
TOWARD THE OVERLOOK

31:59.718 --> 32:03.622
BY THE FLOWER GARDEN.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.024
- I'M THERE NOW.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.349
- I THINK YOU HOOKED HIM.
STAY IN SIGHT.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.638
- STAY CLOSE, ROLLINS.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.606
AGH.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.633
ROLLINS,
UPDATE YOUR LOCATION.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.636
[static]

33:38.684 --> 33:41.187
ROLLINS!

33:41.220 --> 33:42.721
- YOU'RE A FEISTY ONE.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.659
- ROLLINS!
- GIVE ME A SMILE.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.595
- OKAY.

33:52.431 --> 33:55.667
NO, NO, JUST SLOW IT DOWN.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.537
SLOW IT DOWN.
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.972
- LOOK AT ME.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.641
LOOK AT MY FACE.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.543
[skidding]
- POLICE!

34:04.576 --> 34:06.044
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.
NOW!

34:06.078 --> 34:07.613
PUT IT DOWN.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.620
- ALL RIGHT, AMARO!

34:14.653 --> 34:16.688
HEY, ENOUGH!
ENOUGH!

34:16.722 --> 34:18.190
- WHOA, WHOA, COME ON, COME ON,
EASY, EASY.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.758
WE GOT HIM.
I GOT HIM.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.997
- YOU OKAY?

34:26.031 --> 34:29.668
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.069
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO STAY CLOSE.

34:31.103 --> 34:32.604
- I HAD MY SHOT,
AND I TOOK IT.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.006
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

34:35.040 --> 34:37.609
YOU TRYING TO RUIN THIS CASE?

34:42.348 --> 34:44.082
I KNOW THIS GUY
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.617
I KNOW WHAT MAKES HIM TICK,
CAPTAIN.

34:45.651 --> 34:47.619
- JUST SAVE IT.
RIGHT NOW, WE'VE ONLY GOT HIM

34:47.653 --> 34:49.455
ON ONE CHARGE--
HIS ATTACK ON YOU.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.490
- AND THAT MAKES YOU
A WITNESS.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.459
- HOLD ON, GUYS.
THIS IS HER COLLAR.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.027
- NO, HE ATTACKED ROLLINS.
SHE GETS HIS CONFESSION

34:56.061 --> 34:57.663
TO ANYTHING ELSE,
THE DEFENSE'LL GET IT THROWN OUT

34:57.696 --> 34:59.030
ON PREJUDICE.
- I THINK I KNOW

34:59.064 --> 35:00.499
HOW TO CONDUCT MYSELF
ON A WITNESS STAND.

35:00.532 --> 35:03.135
- YOU HEARD THE COUNSELOR.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.970
- THE SECOND I GOT
INTO THAT TUNNEL,

35:05.003 --> 35:06.104
SHE CAME ONTO ME.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.239
- THEN WHY'D YOU NEED
THE KNIFE?

35:07.273 --> 35:08.440
- WE CAUGHT YOU IN THE ACT.

35:08.474 --> 35:09.608
IT'S OVER, DUDE.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.311
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

35:12.344 --> 35:13.312
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HALF OF IT.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.214
- WELL, PLEASE,
TELL US.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.482
WE'RE LISTENING.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.049
- YOU WANT ME TO TALK,
I WILL TALK.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.386
TO HER.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.087
THE BLONDE.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.622
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.325
- OH.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.260
OKAY, THEN.

35:28.294 --> 35:31.129
LAWYER.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.306
- WELL, HE SAID THE MAGIC WORD.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.973
WE GOT ENOUGH TO GET HIM
WITHOUT IT?

35:42.007 --> 35:43.375
- THE WIRE WENT IN AND OUT
IN THE TUNNEL.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.544
AMARO MAY HAVE USED
EXCESSIVE FORCE.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.379
ROLLINS RAN OUT OF HIS VIEW.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.315
- IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO--

35:49.348 --> 35:51.116
- THE DEFENSE WILL PAINT THIS
AS TWO NEW DETECTIVES

35:51.149 --> 35:52.618
TRYING TO MAKE A NAME
FOR THEMSELVES.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.220
- AND THERE'S
STILL REASONABLE DOUBT

35:54.253 --> 35:55.621
ON EVERYTHING
BECAUSE OF HIS TWIN.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.590
- SO, IF HE DOESN'T TALK
TO THE BLONDE, HE WALKS?

36:00.659 --> 36:03.595
CAPTAIN, WE NEED
A STATEMENT.

36:16.708 --> 36:20.512
- HEARD YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

36:23.014 --> 36:26.652
- YOU LOOK SO MUCH PRETTIER
WHEN YOU SMILE.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.720
- SO DO YOU.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.559
YOU KNOW,
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN--

36:33.592 --> 36:36.127
BEEN WANTING TO TALK
TO YOU FOR A LONG TIME.

36:36.161 --> 36:38.230
- OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

36:38.264 --> 36:39.665
- I'M A SOUTHERN GIRL.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.534
I WORKED SEX CRIMES
IN ATLANTA.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.403
I'M ACTUALLY THE ONE
THAT NAMED YOU.

36:47.072 --> 36:49.608
I'VE BEEN OBSESSED WITH YOU
A LITTLE BIT,

36:49.641 --> 36:50.576
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.444
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I WAS YOUR TYPE.

36:52.478 --> 36:54.480
- MM-HMM.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.081
DOWN TO A "T."

36:58.584 --> 37:01.587
- A HELL OF A RUN.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.455
BRIAN, YOU WERE THE BEST.

37:03.489 --> 37:06.157
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
- I AM THE BEST.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.596
YOU AND ME
IN THE--IN THE PARK,

37:10.629 --> 37:12.230
THAT WAS ANOTHER THING.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.333
YOU WERE...

37:14.366 --> 37:16.067
OH, ALL CUTE

37:16.101 --> 37:21.139
AND BOUNCY.

37:21.172 --> 37:22.574
YOU TEASED ME.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.444
- JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER GIRLS.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.313
- WHAT OTHER GIRLS?

37:28.647 --> 37:32.117
OH, THAT WAS MY BROTHER.

37:32.150 --> 37:35.220
IT'S THE SAME DNA.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.757
- SO THAT WAS THE PLAN
ALL ALONG.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.092
JUST LEAVE ENOUGH
OF YOUR DNA

37:41.126 --> 37:43.094
SO WE CAN PIN IT
ON YOUR BROTHER.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.096
AND YOU EVEN MADE SURE
TO GET THE TATTOO

37:45.130 --> 37:48.334
JUST LIKE HIM.
IT'S...

37:48.367 --> 37:51.303
IT'S GENIUS.
- YOU SAID THAT, NOT ME.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.171
- COUPLE OF HOLES,
THOUGH.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.073
- HMM?

37:55.106 --> 37:57.175
- CAN YOU LIFT UP YOUR SHIRT?
- WHAT?

37:57.208 --> 37:59.110
- LIFT UP YOUR SHIRT FOR ME,
BABY.

37:59.144 --> 38:00.612
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.582
- IT IS YOUR PARTY.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.283
- SEE, THAT'S SOME SCAR.

38:05.317 --> 38:06.718
YOUR TWIN BROTHER
DOESN'T HAVE THAT SCAR.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.420
DOESN'T HAVE A CHIPPED TOOTH
EITHER.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.491
WE HAVE VICTIMS
THAT SAW BOTH.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.159
- IS THAT THE BEST
THAT YOU GOT?

38:14.192 --> 38:16.294
I MEAN, IT WAS DARK.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.663
WITNESSES MAKE MISTAKES
ALL THE TIME.

38:17.696 --> 38:18.697
YOU KNOW THAT.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.165
- WHAT ABOUT
THAT HALLOWEEN RAPE?

38:20.198 --> 38:22.668
2003.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.002
DID YOUR BROTHER
DO THAT ONE?

38:24.035 --> 38:25.704
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE COULD HAVE.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.639
- DID YOU KNOW
HIS WIFE HAD A MISCARRIAGE

38:27.673 --> 38:29.240
THAT WEEKEND?

38:29.274 --> 38:32.611
DOCTORS AND NURSES ALL CLAIM
THAT HE NEVER LEFT HER SIDE.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.746
- THERE IS ALWAYS
A BACK DOOR.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.416
- HE WAS 100 MILES AWAY,
BRIAN.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.389
SIT DOWN.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.463
'CAUSE YOU,
YOU MADE ANOTHER MISTAKE.

38:51.497 --> 38:54.265
YOU LOST YOUR SCREWDRIVER
THAT NIGHT IN THE DARK.

38:54.299 --> 38:57.335
YOU LEFT A FINGERPRINT.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.005
IT'S SLOPPY WORK,
YOU KNOW, FOR YOU.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.740
THAT ONE,

39:01.773 --> 39:05.176
IT'S GONNA COST YOU
BIG TIME.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.346
'CAUSE TWINS HAVE THE SAME DNA,

39:08.380 --> 39:10.248
BUT DIFFERENT FINGERPRINTS,
BUT YOU KNEW THAT.

39:10.281 --> 39:11.650
RIGHT?

39:11.683 --> 39:15.754
THAT'S WHY YOU STARTED WEARING
THE GLOVES.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.090
BRIAN.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.261
I KNOW.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.130
YOU HAD TO TEACH YOURSELF
EVERYTHING.

39:25.163 --> 39:28.299
NOT YOUR BROTHER,
NOT GABRIEL.

39:28.333 --> 39:32.237
GABRIEL GOT TO GO TO SCHOOL,
GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.439
HE'S GOT A GREAT LIFE.

39:33.472 --> 39:36.274
I MEAN, YOU'VE SEEN
HIS WIFE, HIS CUTE SON.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.710
YOU FOLLOWED HIM
ALL THESE YEARS,

39:38.744 --> 39:42.548
AND YOU NEVER...
NEVER SAID HELLO.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.350
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.685
- YEAH?
WE MET YOUR MOTHER.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.354
YOUR REAL MOTHER.
AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.624
AND SHE TOLD US
THAT YOU CAME AND FOUND HER.

39:52.658 --> 39:55.226
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?

39:55.260 --> 39:57.195
"I GAVE HIM UP ONCE.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.633
YOU WOULD THINK HE'D TAKE
THE HINT THE FIRST TIME."

40:03.201 --> 40:04.470
AND THAT MUST HAVE HURT.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.404
- SHE'S A DRUNK WHORE.
WHO CARES?

40:06.438 --> 40:07.539
- YOU DO.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.576
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU KNOW
WHAT GOOD CARE

40:10.609 --> 40:11.710
SHE TOOK OF YOUR TWIN.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.412
SHE TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE
OF YOUR BROTHER.

40:14.446 --> 40:15.547
SHE TOLD US
THAT SHE MADE SURE

40:15.581 --> 40:16.648
HE FOUND A GOOD HOME.

40:16.682 --> 40:18.684
SHE MADE SURE
TO SEND BIRTHDAY CARDS.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.519
- I HAD GOOD PARENTS.

40:20.552 --> 40:25.657
- YOUR MOTHER KILLED YOUR FATHER
IN FRONT OF YOU, BRIAN.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.192
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.094
NOBODY SHOULD HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THAT.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.428
- NAH, IT DIDN'T BREAK ME.

40:30.462 --> 40:31.730
- NO?

40:31.763 --> 40:33.064
I DISAGREE.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.500
YOUR OWN MOTHER GAVE YOU UP.

40:34.533 --> 40:39.437
YOUR SECOND MOTHER,
SHE'S A NIGHTMARE.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.206
BRIAN.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.208
IT'S OKAY.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.644
ANYBODY WOULD BE BROKEN.

40:50.115 --> 40:54.085
NO ONE'S EVER REALLY LISTENED
TO YOU, HAVE THEY?

40:56.755 --> 41:02.293
I WANT TO HEAR
YOUR WHOLE STORY.

41:02.327 --> 41:06.532
NOT JUST THESE...MISTAKES.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.701
EVERYTHING.

41:09.735 --> 41:12.370
I'VE GOT ALL NIGHT.

41:12.403 --> 41:15.373
AND I'M NOT LEAVIN' YOU.

41:18.443 --> 41:23.649
LOOK AT ME.

41:23.682 --> 41:26.718
LOOK AT MY FACE.

41:38.764 --> 41:44.069
- IT'S OVER, GABRIEL.
[latch clicks]

41:44.102 --> 41:45.571
YOU'RE FREE TO GO HOME.

41:45.604 --> 41:48.506
- JUST LIKE THAT?
WHY?

41:48.540 --> 41:50.275
WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

41:50.308 --> 41:51.543
- WE FOUND THE GUY.

41:51.577 --> 41:55.046
- WHO?

42:07.258 --> 42:09.695
WHO IS THAT?

42:09.728 --> 42:12.297
- YOUR TWIN BROTHER.

42:12.330 --> 42:14.600
- MY...

42:14.633 --> 42:16.635
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.237
- HE DID.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.784
