00:03.504 --> 00:05.254
not to watch this time
when the baby came out?

00:05.306 --> 00:06.889
- I hadn't thought about it
at all

00:06.924 --> 00:08.073
until you just mentioned it.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.275
- So, does that mean you can
still look at me sexually?

00:10.311 --> 00:11.610
Like, you--
- yeah.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.645
You certainly don't look
like you're overweight

00:13.681 --> 00:17.516
in any way,
shape, and form.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.402

Bye!

for hurting you.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.379
- I appreciate you
saying that.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.715

01:06.267 --> 01:09.485

01:29.023 --> 01:33.325
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.679
- My blessings are many,
and my patience is none.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.849

just grade on the curve.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.851
She sets the curve.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.370

01:45.406 --> 01:47.606
imitated,
or intimidated.

08:46.076 --> 08:47.576

- Ashley, that's not okay.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.127

- Okay.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.745
- That's all.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.415
- Coming up next...

08:53.450 --> 08:56.401
- It's okay to talk about
how you feel.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.420
- Right now, it looks like
you're kinda like a vampire.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.505
You don't really
have any feelings. So...

09:04.043 --> 09:06.011
- Did you listen to ashley
'cause that was a issue?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.095
- Which was an issue?

09:07.130 --> 09:09.281
- When you just wouldn't
let me sleep in the corner.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.799
- What corner?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.884

- Okay.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.778

- Alzheimer's is a real issue.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.646

- Honey, you don't--

09:24.698 --> 09:25.780
you don't need to defend me.
I'm good.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.765
- Coming from a female
who is married to a older man,

09:27.784 --> 09:29.267
that should never
come out of your mouth.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.485
- I would say it
to you, too!

09:30.537 --> 09:31.970
I would say it to you, too.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.455

- I'm-- I'm not an ageist!

your feelings, I'm sorry.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.043
I'm not sorry about what I said,
and I'm done with it.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.245
- You-- you don't need to
add that part, though, g.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.546
- It's the truth.
- Then don't--

09:41.582 --> 09:42.714
don't deliver
an apology at all.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.748
That's fine.
I don't need it.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.950
- All right. What the (bleep)
is going on here?

09:45.969 --> 09:47.285
- Remember when we were talking
about the bachelorette party?

09:47.304 --> 09:49.471
- Right.
- And you said he wants
a woman to jump out the cake?

09:49.506 --> 09:50.589
- Yeah.
- Well, you're the cake.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.590
- You're the woman.
- You're the woman. Let's go.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.891
- Oh, oh!
- Get in.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.593
- Oh, I'm the woman. Okay.
- Okay, okay.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.811
- O-m-g.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.179
- I'm too tall.
- Oh, you have to hold it up.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.848
- Alt-heimer's is a real issue.
- Can't we joke and have fun?

09:59.900 --> 10:00.899
That's all.
- It's called alzheimer's

10:00.934 --> 10:02.233
there's a "z," and I did not--
I was not say--

10:02.269 --> 10:03.818
I was not saying it
to be insulting.

10:03.854 --> 10:04.986
- Yes, it's a disease,
and you should never wish that

10:05.022 --> 10:06.905
and say or ask and say,
"what do you have? Alzheimer's?"

10:06.940 --> 10:08.306
- I was saying why are you--
why are you talking like I--

10:08.325 --> 10:09.975
like we weren't
on the bus together?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.242
I said amnesia first.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.277
- I don't have to
explain myself.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.345
- Do you have
selective hearing?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.546
I know what I said.
- No.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.614
- Oh.
- I know what I said.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.449
- So, where's your husband?
It's a couples trip.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.651
- At home with my children.
- Are you sure?

10:19.686 --> 10:21.786
- Oh!
- Ahh!
- Uh, yeah.

10:21.821 --> 10:25.924
- Ashley thinks that
she can puff up her chest

10:25.959 --> 10:27.825
at the girls, and they're
just supposed to sit back

10:27.844 --> 10:29.661
and take it,
but, honey,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.297
mia is too big to just
sit back and take anything.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.666
She's gonna let you have it,
and I'm content to sit here

10:34.685 --> 10:36.351
and eat my little
potatoes and corn

10:36.386 --> 10:37.335
and watch it happen.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.371
- You have something else
you'd like to say?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.672
- No, I said it.
- Right, but, obviously,

10:40.707 --> 10:42.674
there's something--
an undertone.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.542
- No, I was just wondering.
- We can make it an overtone.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.227
- This is like
a tennis match.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.197
Ooh, chile...
Bitch.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.732
- Ashley,
you need a hug, dear?

10:50.784 --> 10:51.733
- She needs dick,
is what she need, a black one.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.385
- If I do, I'm gettin' it
from somebody else.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.886
Robyn? You wanna give me
a hug, robyn?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.388
- A big, black dick, try it.
- Robyn, give her a hug.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.989
- Yeah.
- Aww.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.827
- Girl, again,
we're on a couples trip.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.663
Why haven't I
met your husband?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.381
Are you embarrassed by him?

11:06.416 --> 11:08.383
Plus, we're on
a freakin' vacation.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.384
Why are you asleep anyway?

11:09.419 --> 11:13.922
If you're so damn tired,
take your ass back home.

11:13.974 --> 11:14.839

- that's my issue.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.141

15:43.093 --> 15:44.342
- Are they dead?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.060
- "we request the honor of
your presence

15:46.096 --> 15:48.179
at the 25th anniversary
celebration

15:48.214 --> 15:50.181
of raymond and karen huger."

15:50.216 --> 15:52.817
- ahh.
- She sent us mothballs?

15:52.852 --> 15:55.320
- Mom, they're butterflies.
They're just dead.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.555
- This one died
on the ground.

15:57.574 --> 16:01.225
Karen's invitations,
are they over the top?

16:01.244 --> 16:02.093
Yes.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.763
♪ la grand dame
has moved back ♪

16:05.799 --> 16:07.565
♪ to potomac ♪

16:07.584 --> 16:08.282
- girl.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.001
- Do they make any sense?
No.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.419
- "stop the hate.

16:11.454 --> 16:13.070
Spreading light."
what the (bleep)?

16:13.089 --> 16:14.105
I don't understand this.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.407
- But she thinks
they are grand.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.376
This is what
the grand dame does.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.962
No, girl.
Send me a text.

16:21.014 --> 16:24.349
- Did you happen to get
a unique invitation today?

16:26.085 --> 16:28.386
[laughing]

16:28.421 --> 16:30.788
- robyn, they're butterflies,
not moths.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.775
- Aww.
- Go on.

16:33.810 --> 16:35.309
Go find your mama.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.895
I can see where karen
was going with this.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.983
Typically, in marriage,
you go into a cocoon.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.101
Don't you turn
into a cocoon?

16:44.120 --> 16:44.986
And then, like,
you're a butterfly,

16:45.038 --> 16:46.270
a caterpillar,
or somethin' like that.

16:46.289 --> 16:47.538
Isn't that?
Lord have mercy.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.607
Don't get me
back to kindergarten.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.243
Are you excited about
going to her vow renewal?

16:52.278 --> 16:53.878
- Yeah.
They're a cute couple.

16:53.913 --> 16:54.829
- They are cute.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.831
I can see why they've
made it to 25 years.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.050
It feels good to be home.
- Yeah, finally.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.468
- I was concerned
about the kids.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.620
- Well, me, too,
very much so.

17:02.639 --> 17:04.589
- She giving you problems?

17:07.177 --> 17:08.843
[laughing]

17:11.314 --> 17:14.298
- now, we know for good reason.
- I know.

17:14.317 --> 17:15.633
- I don't wanna
put her on blast

17:15.652 --> 17:17.802
or say things about her.
She's your mother.

17:17.821 --> 17:18.803
You love her dearly.

17:18.822 --> 17:19.737
- Yeah, but that was some
theatrical-ass sh--.

17:19.773 --> 17:20.688
- Yeah.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.640
- I know it was very distracting
for us to be

17:22.659 --> 17:23.825
on our anniversary dinner,

17:23.860 --> 17:26.360
and my phone is
chirp, chirp, chirp.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.746
After coming back
from chesapeake,

17:28.782 --> 17:30.448
gordon decided for our
anniversary to have, like,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.016
a staycation.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.317
- But she kept
bothering you.

17:33.336 --> 17:34.485
That's when I called her
and said,

17:34.504 --> 17:35.753
"you know,
why are you bothering her?

17:35.789 --> 17:36.988
Can't you just
figure it out?"

17:37.023 --> 17:38.489
- oh, okay.

17:38.508 --> 17:39.490
- She-and she made the comment
and said, "you know, g,

17:39.509 --> 17:41.492
these are your kids,"
and click and hung up.

17:41.511 --> 17:44.045
- My mom was
completely overwhelmed

17:44.097 --> 17:47.381
and got into an argument
with gordon over the phone

17:47.434 --> 17:50.601
because she couldn't decide
what to feed the kids.

17:50.637 --> 17:54.505
So, I ended up coming home
two hours after leaving.

17:54.524 --> 17:55.506
- Then I tried to
call her back,

17:55.542 --> 17:56.841
and she wouldn't
answer the phone.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.559
- And see,
that's a problem for me.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.896
When my mom gets upset,
she leaves.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.382
I've seen her leave me
as a child.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.517
I thought about it,
and I was not going to

18:06.553 --> 18:10.955
allow my children to have to
experience that abandonment.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.041
We came back home,
and you guys started like...

18:14.077 --> 18:14.909
- No, not you guys.

18:14.961 --> 18:15.710
She went in on me,
and I stood there.

18:15.745 --> 18:16.410
- My, yeah,
mom went in on you.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.211
- Right.
Let's get it right.

18:17.247 --> 18:19.530
I stood there
quietly taking it.

18:19.549 --> 18:20.865
- You did.
- I stood there.

18:20.884 --> 18:22.700
- And my mind was
thinking the whole time.

18:22.719 --> 18:24.218
The kids are watching this.
- And then it got-- exactly.

18:24.254 --> 18:25.720
It got to the point where I'm--
- and we don't do this

18:25.755 --> 18:26.888
in front of the children.
- Exactly.

18:26.923 --> 18:28.873
I said, "rhonda, you're not
gonna talk to me that way.

18:28.892 --> 18:29.724
I'm not your kid."

18:29.759 --> 18:31.559
- and then she storms
out the door.

18:31.594 --> 18:33.728
Then josh is like,
"what's wrong with grandma?"

18:33.763 --> 18:35.596
jeremiah,
"what's wrong with grandma?"

18:35.648 --> 18:36.981
julianna,
"what's wrong with grandma?"

18:37.016 --> 18:39.650
and that's what hurts me
because this is what

18:39.686 --> 18:41.552
I've been trying to
protect them from.

18:41.571 --> 18:44.856
I don't want them to be
exposed to any of that bullsh--.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.407
- Which is a shame
to be in that position.

18:46.442 --> 18:47.441
- It is 'cause she's left me

18:47.494 --> 18:50.227
in some really
sh---y situations.

18:50.246 --> 18:54.115
Mom's behavior definitely
triggered my childhood trauma.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.568
I went back to being
the eight-year-old little girl

18:57.587 --> 18:58.753
searching for mommy,

18:58.788 --> 19:00.738
and mommy is upset
and running out.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.407
I remember christmas eve.

19:03.426 --> 19:06.677
She never came.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.846
And we've worked so hard
to get to where we are,

19:08.882 --> 19:13.768
and overnight, pow,
back to square one.

19:13.803 --> 19:15.269
- You know, maybe there is
a second chance.

19:15.305 --> 19:16.521
But as of right now,
I don't plan on

19:16.556 --> 19:18.756
leaving my kids alone with her.

19:18.775 --> 19:21.225
It's seems like it's behavior
that keeps repeating itself.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.060
- Yeah.

19:23.095 --> 19:37.825
♪♪

19:39.779 --> 19:41.078
- okay, too fast, too fast.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.481
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.382
All right.
So, guys,

19:44.417 --> 19:45.616
we know I'm doing
the circular driveway.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.817
- Yes.
- Yeah.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.787
- So, just kinda
gettin' ideas for...

19:49.822 --> 19:51.989
Alongside the driveway.
- Plants.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.025
- But, like, things like this.
- No.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.660
Don't you want some flowers
or something?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.962
- Some color?
- Okay, fine, um...

19:57.997 --> 20:00.097
- Our house is already, like,
white and plain looking.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.599
- But do you like the changes
that are being made?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.700
- Yeah, it's so much better.

20:02.735 --> 20:03.668
- Yeah, our house
looks way better.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.969
- Yay, way better.
Yay.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.337
- We moved into a shack.
- Yes, it was.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.872
It was very crusty, um,

20:07.907 --> 20:09.240
but now
it's so much better, right?

20:09.275 --> 20:10.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.492
- We're putting
the final touches

20:11.527 --> 20:14.545
on the hotel gizelle,
and I love my house.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.665
I can't wait for you to see
my $8,000 chandelier.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.450
Gizelle works hard, okay?

20:19.485 --> 20:22.620
So, maybe we can intertwine
some of this with some of this.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.621
This is nice.
Do you like this?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.422
- Those are disgusting.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.490
- Guys, give a sister
some love.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.541
- Okay.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.660
- Okay, so, you know,
karen has her vow renewal,

20:29.696 --> 20:30.861
right?
- Yeah.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.496
- Should I bring a date
to karen's thing?

20:32.532 --> 20:33.197
- No, no.
- No.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.065
- Yes.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.266
- If you want--
if you like someone.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.133
- If you don't know them,
you don't wanna bring them out.

20:36.169 --> 20:36.801
You don't know how
they're gonna act.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.003
- Yeah.
- This is true.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.505
Okay, but, guys,
how do yo guys feel about me,

20:41.541 --> 20:43.724
you know, going out
every now and again?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.276
- That's fine.
- Um, it's good.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.527
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:46.562 --> 20:48.145
- We just don't want you alone,
and gross, and by yourself.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.064
- Old.

20:50.116 --> 20:51.115
- Huh?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.366
- We don't want you to,
like, die alone, so...

20:52.402 --> 20:53.684
- Yeah.

20:53.703 --> 20:55.119
- She not dying alone.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.387
- It's looking like that.
- It's lookin' like that.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.371
You don't have
anyone near you.

20:57.407 --> 21:01.025
- Yeah, you're
pretty lonely.

21:01.060 --> 21:05.630
- Okay, but right now,
I'm casually dating.

21:07.383 --> 21:09.000
[clears throat]
yes.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.702
But these are just
casual encounters.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.254
- But do you want
a serious relationship?

21:13.306 --> 21:14.371
- Not right now.

21:14.390 --> 21:15.222
- So, then why
are you dating?

21:15.258 --> 21:16.057
- So, what is the point?

21:16.092 --> 21:17.408
- Just for fun
'cause she's bored.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.809
- What?

21:19.846 --> 21:23.414
- None of your business.
[laughter]

21:23.449 --> 21:24.348
- she's not dating
for friends, though.

21:24.384 --> 21:24.749
- We just don't want you
to be by yourself.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.683
That's all.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.234
We just don't want
you to be by yourself.

21:27.270 --> 21:28.419
- Yeah.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.287
- I got my--
my foot is kinda starting--

21:29.322 --> 21:31.389
like, I-I wanna sit down
for a second.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.891
Whew, chile.
Oh, gosh.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.759
- Ooh, I think
we're gonna break the bench.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.427
- Now, this bench
is a little rickety.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.095
[laughing]
it's a little rickety.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.431
Speaking of, like, dating
and all that kinda good stuff,

21:40.466 --> 21:42.066
you guys made it
very clear to me

21:42.101 --> 21:45.670
that I'm emotionally
unavailable.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.922
I have not necessarily
been vulnerable

21:47.957 --> 21:51.208
in my relationships with men.

21:51.244 --> 21:51.909
- Okay.
- We know.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.544
- Okay.
So, you guys are--

21:53.579 --> 21:55.713
are gonna start dating
very soon,

21:55.748 --> 21:57.315
if you're not already,
grace gizelle bryant.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.249
[laughing]

21:58.284 --> 22:01.602
and I don't want you guys
to be that way.

22:01.637 --> 22:03.754
- Well, it's, like, harder
for us because, like,

22:03.773 --> 22:07.692
we don't see you, like,
in relationships.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.096
Like, it's hard
to, like, look up

22:12.131 --> 22:14.365
to you or dad.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.040
- It's like,
harder for us

22:23.076 --> 22:24.892
because, like,
we don't see you,

22:24.927 --> 22:27.578
like, in relationships.

22:27.613 --> 22:29.013
Like, it's hard
to, like, look up

22:29.048 --> 22:32.483
to you or dad.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.051
- It's like you saw
a marriage,

22:34.087 --> 22:36.087
and then you saw it,
like, disappear,

22:36.122 --> 22:36.987
and then we just
never saw one.

22:37.023 --> 22:37.888
- We didn't-- we never
saw one at all,

22:37.924 --> 22:38.572
so it's hard.
- I don't even remember

22:38.608 --> 22:40.274
you guys being married.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.910
- It's hard to see what
it's supposed to look like.

22:42.945 --> 22:43.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.830
- Yeah, to see what
it actually is.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.083
- Wow, this is, like,
worse than I thought.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.267
- I mean, it's
not your fault.

22:50.303 --> 22:51.268
- Oh, no, no, no.
- But it's just, like,

22:51.304 --> 22:52.086
it's just hard for us,
and it's gonna be hard

22:52.121 --> 22:54.271
for our whole lives
because we never

22:54.307 --> 22:56.290
had that experience.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.510
- I was born with walls.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.212
I just did not know
what they were

23:01.247 --> 23:03.481
until my children
are staring me

23:03.516 --> 23:05.582
in my face
and telling me.

23:05.601 --> 23:09.103
Emotionally, I am
as tough as it gets,

23:09.138 --> 23:11.188
but I don't ever
wanna be so tough

23:11.224 --> 23:14.959
that I can't be
a better example to them.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.277
There's a lotta things
that I could have discussed

23:16.312 --> 23:17.261
with your father

23:17.296 --> 23:19.096
to make things better
in our relationship,

23:19.115 --> 23:21.148
and I chose not to.
That's on me.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.535
It's okay to talk about
how you feel.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.288
- But, also, you should
lead by example.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.273

why it happened, michael?

comfortable at this point.

of sexual intimacy,

25:48.965 --> 25:51.348

So, he just doesn't need it.
- Why don't you ask him?

25:58.808 --> 26:00.724
- I did,
and he said he doesn't.

26:00.759 --> 26:01.775
So, he's telling me
the truth, I guess.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.761

- I should just trust him.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.814
Okay.

like he's being truthful?

he's being truthful.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.290

check in with him.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.459
- Yeah. I ask, like,
you know,

26:18.494 --> 26:20.294
or, like, I'll try to rub
his leg or something

26:20.329 --> 26:22.496
or just anything that
indicates that, like,

26:22.548 --> 26:25.666
you know, I'm-I'm open
for some sort of touching

26:25.718 --> 26:27.117
and stuff like that.
- Mm-hmm.

26:27.136 --> 26:29.303
- And sometimes he'll take it,
and sometimes he'll say,

26:29.338 --> 26:31.922
"thank you, babe,
but I'm tired."

26:31.957 --> 26:35.643
the timing for when michael
had his infidelity

26:35.678 --> 26:38.846
was about two to three months
postpartum with dean,

where I am with dylan.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.802

a physical touch without sexual.

If you drop a vase
on the ground,

26:48.691 --> 26:50.157

see the cracks.

I still wanna be with him.

with him about sex?

I'll say, "I am sorry.

"I left you guys alone.
Don't worry."

32:05.641 --> 32:07.658

You're always right.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.313

I'm not always right.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.331

you're never wrong.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.332
- But I'm telling
you the truth.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.817
I'm about to call an uber
and get outta here.

not call the uber.

Did you just put
your sunglasses on?

32:23.125 --> 32:24.791
Okay.

- Please sit down.

You're in my shot.

I don't-- I just don't need
people around me like that.

bury the hatchet.

buried that knife.

waste my time with that.

Though, I get to spend
time with juan.

36:21.663 --> 36:23.997

36:24.032 --> 36:25.699

a natural thing,

36:25.734 --> 36:29.619
a natural friendship
between michael and juan.

36:29.671 --> 36:32.873

uncomfortable right now.

Mmm, very nice, baby.

37:04.489 --> 37:05.939
Coming up next...

37:05.958 --> 37:07.941

do you think that

37:07.960 --> 37:11.661
you are communicating
to your daughters

37:11.713 --> 37:14.464
about relationships?
- Probably not good ones.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.217
- Mm-hmm.
- This is horrible.

37:24.893 --> 37:26.860
- Look here, my, my, my.
- How are you?

37:26.895 --> 37:28.612
- Yeah, yeah, we got--
we got some--

37:28.664 --> 37:29.963
- my, my.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.665
- We got some situations
here with my foot.

37:31.700 --> 37:35.401
- Oh, my, okay.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.236
So, how are you
feeling, though?

37:37.256 --> 37:39.372
- Um, my foot?
- Yes.

37:39.407 --> 37:42.742
- Horrible but, like,
you know, I would have--

37:42.761 --> 37:43.910
thank you. Is this okay?
- Yes. That's good?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.795
You good?
- Okay, yes, I'm good.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.597
I would have, you know,
canceled, but you-you are

37:47.633 --> 37:49.633
in high demand, sir,
and I thought, you know,

37:49.685 --> 37:51.250
I wouldn't be able to get back
in the schedule

37:51.270 --> 37:52.418
until, like, christmas.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.088
- Even if I was in high demand,
I would always make time

37:55.107 --> 37:57.791
for my favorite person.
- Aww.

37:57.826 --> 38:00.143
- You know, 'cause I've
been thinkin' about you, so.

38:00.195 --> 38:03.363
- It's been a minute,
but I do remember that

38:03.398 --> 38:06.432
I needed to work on being
a little bit more vulnerable.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.434
- Right.

38:07.469 --> 38:09.602
- I think I terminate
all of my relationships.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.570
Is that bad?

38:10.605 --> 38:14.658
- Where did that emotion go?
Where did it go?

38:14.710 --> 38:15.709
- And actually,
that's kinda, like,

38:15.744 --> 38:18.628
why we're here because
I'm talkin' to the girls,

38:18.664 --> 38:23.833
and they inform me that

38:23.885 --> 38:28.688
I'm emotionally
unavailable for them.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.640
- So, that must be really
troubling for you.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.175
- Yes.

38:32.227 --> 38:35.428
I always wanna make sure
I'm being my best self

38:35.464 --> 38:37.397
and especially when it comes
to me being a mom,

38:37.432 --> 38:39.065
and if my kids are gonna
hit me upside the head

38:39.101 --> 38:40.350
with the fact that,
you know,

38:40.402 --> 38:43.903
mommy is not emotionally
available for them--

38:43.939 --> 38:46.239
I have not
necessarily been vulnerable

38:46.274 --> 38:48.975
in my relationships
with men,

38:48.994 --> 38:52.879
and I don't want you guys
to be that way.

38:52.914 --> 38:55.498
- Well, like, it's hard to,
like, look up to you or dad

38:55.534 --> 39:00.170
because, like, we don't see
you, like, in relationships.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.872
- Then definitely, I've gotta
do somethin' about it.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.375
Also, I had reconnected
with their father.

39:05.427 --> 39:08.461
- Why did you re-reconnect
with your ex-husband?

39:08.496 --> 39:10.880
- Good question.
Um, I don't know.

39:10.932 --> 39:15.051
I just felt like I was at
a place where I wanted to

39:15.103 --> 39:18.805
take that leap, you know, to
get the family back together.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.523
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

39:20.559 --> 39:21.908
- Was there, like,
a love force

39:21.943 --> 39:24.060
that was driving you
to do this?

39:24.112 --> 39:27.731
- I felt like he was
looking at me

39:27.783 --> 39:29.182
a little bit different.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.402
- Um, a lot of-- a lot
much more respect.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.520
And before the pandemic,
we were seeing each other

39:34.539 --> 39:37.557
all the time, flying back
and forth, all that.

39:37.592 --> 39:38.742
- Blow it. Ha!

39:38.794 --> 39:42.412
[laughing]

39:44.249 --> 39:46.800
- not being able to
see each other,

39:46.835 --> 39:48.201
it just made me look at
everything differently,

39:48.220 --> 39:51.838
and it just made me feel
like I do like my space.

39:51.873 --> 39:54.057
I do like my freedom.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.092
Yes, I need a man.
I want a man.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.845
I just don't wanna
answer to one.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.430
[sighs]

40:00.482 --> 40:02.182
- partnership is about
two people answering

40:02.217 --> 40:05.402
to one another and
being accountable.

40:05.437 --> 40:10.940
What message do you think
that you are communicating

40:10.992 --> 40:15.111
to your daughters
about relationships?

40:15.163 --> 40:19.282
[sighs]

40:19.334 --> 40:22.902
- probably not good ones.
- Mm-hmm.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.872
Now, they've seen
their parents reconnect

40:25.907 --> 40:28.458
and then now separate,
and they're wondering.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.460
What is love?
What is it?

40:30.512 --> 40:32.962
What is it
really all about?

40:33.014 --> 40:35.298
- This is horrible.

40:35.350 --> 40:40.136
- Maybe you just haven't had
honest, open conversations

40:40.188 --> 40:44.023
with them about what
you're goin' through.

40:44.059 --> 40:47.811
They say, "mom, you're not
emotionally available."

40:47.863 --> 40:50.947
- right.
- That means you're cold.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.198
- I thought I was
doing a good job.

40:52.234 --> 40:54.818
- Mm-hmm.
- Apparently, um,

40:54.870 --> 40:57.871
I've been having
some missteps.

40:57.906 --> 41:01.040
- Let your walls down
because when your walls

41:01.076 --> 41:04.828
come down, there's
a beauty that comes out.

41:04.880 --> 41:10.616
You have the opportunity
to make a major change.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.302
And when you're daughters
grow up, they're gonna

41:12.337 --> 41:15.955
remember how they felt
around you, that connection.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.842
- When it comes to
relationships, I feel like

41:18.894 --> 41:22.428
emotionally I am as
tough as it gets.

41:22.463 --> 41:24.097
Sherman and I are done.
It's a wrap.

41:24.132 --> 41:25.315
- Holy sh...
- What?

41:25.350 --> 41:27.400
- How is the relationship
with you and jamal, right now?

41:27.435 --> 41:29.352
- It's not good.

41:29.404 --> 41:30.904
- You know each other.
- True.

41:30.939 --> 41:32.105
- You know each other's
bumps and bruises.

41:32.140 --> 41:35.474
You would have to be getting
to know a whole new person.

41:35.494 --> 41:38.528
- Or I could just be by
myself for a little while.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.447
But I do wanna set a good
example for my girls

41:41.482 --> 41:45.151
and help them whenever they get
into their relationships

41:45.170 --> 41:48.004
and to know my door
is always open for them,

41:48.039 --> 41:49.205
and they've gotta
be able to feel that.

41:53.661 --> 41:56.212
- Let me tell you what I see
in your eyes, right now.

41:56.264 --> 42:00.216
- What?
- Vulnerability.

42:00.268 --> 42:04.003
- 'cause I feel like
I have direction,

42:04.039 --> 42:07.473
so if-if you're tellin' me
that these things

42:07.508 --> 42:11.694
will help my children,
then I'm gonna do it.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.364
Next time, on
the season finale of

42:14.399 --> 42:17.066
"the real housewives
of potomac"...

42:17.118 --> 42:18.701
- I need to make sure every
mother----in' thing

42:18.737 --> 42:20.286
is in place for
this wedding.

42:20.322 --> 42:23.573
[applause]
- come on down, carefully.

42:23.625 --> 42:26.492
Oh, lord.
Okay, jesus.

42:26.528 --> 42:27.577
[gasps]

42:27.629 --> 42:29.412
- you put your hands on me.
You should apologize.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.713
- Wait. Well, hold up.
- Wait.

42:30.749 --> 42:31.497
- Chris, chris,
chris, chris.

42:31.533 --> 42:32.232
- This is
the whitest privilege.

42:32.267 --> 42:36.252
I have to go.
- Oh, my god!

42:36.304 --> 42:38.037
- That mother----er didn't
wanna have a dialogue.

42:38.056 --> 42:38.871
- Candiace,
I-I get that!

42:38.890 --> 42:40.540
- Okay, I-I'm
done talking to you.

42:40.575 --> 42:41.925
- You've gotta see
the other side.

42:41.977 --> 42:43.259
- No, you need to
shut the (bleep) up

42:43.311 --> 42:46.429
talkin' to me crazy.
- That's how it is?

42:46.481 --> 42:48.565
- Before having a baby,
we have to make sure that

42:48.600 --> 42:51.384
the things that happened
before don't happen again.

42:51.403 --> 42:54.103
- That was 13 years ago.
She's being stupid.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.072
- No, I'm not.
- You are.
