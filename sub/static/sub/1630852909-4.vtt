A NETFLIX SERIES

00:16.160 --> 00:17.920
There's chocolate ice cream,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.760
chocolate mousse, and brittle.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.640
-Would that be a dessert?
-Yes, and it's chocolate.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.680
Excellent. Ian is nuts about chocolate.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.480
Thanks. I'm not hungry.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.120
Did someone switch my son?

00:29.200 --> 00:32.120
You hardly ate.
And now you don't want any chocolate?

00:33.160 --> 00:36.360
I'm gonna get
the berry and honey meringue.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.520
-I'll get that for you.
-Please. Thanks.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.720
-Are you feeling all right?
-I'm okay.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.720
Hi.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.360
Hello. How was dinner, family?
Did you try the chicken curry wrap?

00:46.440 --> 00:48.760
Excellent. And the roasted eggplant too.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.680
-What was the crunchy thing?
-Pistachio and pomegranate.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.760
The pomegranate doesn't have
flavor but adds texture.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.640
-Really good. Well done.
-Thank you.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.480
Tomorrow we're going on an outing
to Waterloop, a really cool wake park.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.320
-What do you say? Are you in?
-We leave from the main dock at 10:00 a.m.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.680
Sorry, boys.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.240
Ian lost his appetite. He must be sick.
We're gonna have to cancel.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.640
Don't decide for me, Dad.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.120
I already published a story
for the wake park video with the twins.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.480
I can't cancel. Absolutely confirmed.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.360
-Okay.
-I'm gonna go right now.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.160
-Absolutely confirmed.
-I'll put you down.

CIELO GRANDE 2001/AUGUST
ROOM

03:09.440 --> 03:15.120
ALONE WITH THE BREAD BASKET…
YOU COMING?

03:15.200 --> 03:18.360
GOING IN FIVE!

03:44.880 --> 03:46.040
Why the backpack?

03:46.640 --> 03:49.360
Tired of training
so you're going back to Mexico?

03:50.440 --> 03:51.840
You got me, Tony.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.560
The truth is I was leaving Cielo Grande,
but I came back for you.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.880
-That gave me a reason to leave you alone.
-Thanks.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.640
And our favorite star,
are you coming on the outing tomorrow?

04:02.720 --> 04:04.800
No. Thanks so much, Charly.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.600
But we have a training plan.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.520
Well, clearing your head
is also a form of training, isn't it?

04:11.040 --> 04:13.560
That's true. Relax, Tony.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.840
What's the rush? We can take a day.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.360
-So you'll come?
-Yes, we will.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.960
It'll be great. Shall we?

04:24.600 --> 04:27.840
I think we should keep
training consistent, Steffi.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.440
Enough, Tony.
The competition will be relaxed.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.800
Like you always say,
"Relax and enjoy." Okay?

04:43.680 --> 04:46.200
The soundboard is almost working. Perfect.

04:50.080 --> 04:50.960
All right.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.240
Now you'll have to sing, Julián.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.440
What do you mean, no?

04:56.080 --> 04:57.200
Come on.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
<i>I have that feeling</i>

05:02.720 --> 05:03.840
Good. Let's go.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.320
<i>That electrifies me</i>

05:06.920 --> 05:08.840
<i>Time loses distance</i>

05:08.920 --> 05:11.360
<i>I feel everything slowly</i>

05:12.000 --> 05:14.240
<i>And I stay with you</i>

05:14.320 --> 05:16.880
<i>While a song is playing</i>

05:16.960 --> 05:21.120
<i>I leave everything</i>
<i>Isolate myself from the world</i>

05:21.800 --> 05:24.320
<i>I feel special</i>

05:24.400 --> 05:27.080
<i>I want to dance</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:31.600
<i>And I don't care if I don't have rhythm</i>

05:31.680 --> 05:34.480
<i>When I'm with you</i>

05:34.560 --> 05:37.200
<i>I have that feeling</i>

05:37.280 --> 05:41.560
<i>That stopped me</i>
<i>And that I looked for all my life</i>

05:42.160 --> 05:44.880
<i>With you I found that</i>

05:44.960 --> 05:47.120
<i>Lucky for me</i>

05:47.200 --> 05:51.400
<i>You looked and now I live lofty sighs</i>

05:51.480 --> 05:53.160
<i>Lofty sighs</i>

05:54.200 --> 05:56.160
<i>Lofty sighs</i>

05:57.000 --> 05:58.320
<i>Lofty sighs</i>

06:01.720 --> 06:03.640
<i>Lofty sighs</i>

06:04.560 --> 06:06.040
<i>Lofty sighs</i>

06:06.960 --> 06:08.520
<i>Lofty sighs</i>

06:14.560 --> 06:18.280
-We really deserve the applause.
-Sky Vibes is turning out incredible.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.480
Well, team, that's enough for today.
It's already late.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.600
-What?
-One more.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.960
One more!

06:33.800 --> 06:39.520
Waterloop excursion.
Gather round, please. Who else?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.680
Everything's ready, so get on, guys.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.760
Leaving soon.
We're missing one, but then we're off.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.600
"We had a wonderful stay."

07:08.120 --> 07:10.360
"We'll be back. Julieta and Santiago."

07:10.880 --> 07:12.480
"Thanks for everything."

07:17.600 --> 07:22.200
"The best trophy isn't always
the one you carry in your suitcase,

07:22.280 --> 07:23.880
because, along with the river,

07:23.960 --> 07:27.400
this enchanted site,
and the magical stars,

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
I found love."

07:43.880 --> 07:47.680
3 MISSED CALLS

07:47.760 --> 07:48.760
Wake park!

07:49.800 --> 07:51.200
I'm here!

07:51.760 --> 07:53.760
-Hold on. I'm here.
-Now it's time.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.360
Steffi, Cielo Grande's sleeping beauty,
has arrived. Go ahead.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.320
Thanks.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.240
Passengers, we're ready to go.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.240
Come on.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.040
How interesting. I didn't know
this place had so many stories.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.920
Thousands. I was practically born here.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.320
Did you know it's rumored
I'm a descendant of Christopher Columbus?

08:21.840 --> 08:23.440
The guy who discovered America?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.760
You're right.
That's why I thought you looked familiar.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.040
See? I have my next Halloween costume.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.440
Luz has also spent a lot of time here,
hasn't she?

08:33.520 --> 08:36.320
-She told me a little about her life.
-Yeah.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.880
Cielo is our place in the world.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.200
We've come since we were little.
She'd come with her grandparents and mom.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.480
What about your parents?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.280
They died in an accident.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.640
They were the best parents in the world.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.840
I'm really sorry.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.600
Don't worry about it.
Even if it seems strange,

08:59.680 --> 09:02.640
thanks to them,
I love rivers and all this.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.320
Me too.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.240
Rivers and water sports are

09:08.120 --> 09:08.960
fulfilling.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.880
Exactly. Same for me.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.200
-I have the best news, Augusto.
-What?

09:17.280 --> 09:21.080
I just confirmed a big new competitor.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.800
She's on her way
to participate in the competition.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.800
-Who?
-Natasha Rossi.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.520
-No. Natasha Rossi here?
-Yeah, she was training in the US.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.240
And it seems she changed her plans
just to come here.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.680
Steffi and Natasha in the Summer Crush!

09:34.760 --> 09:36.080
It's gonna be great.

09:36.160 --> 09:40.800
I'm more a fan of Steffi for her style,
but Natasha's been undefeated for a year.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.920
I hope this helps us
get money to pay the bank.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.440
I have an idea.
What if we open Sky Vibes tomorrow?

09:48.040 --> 09:51.120
If Natasha posts something,
I'm sure more tourists will come.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.520
Great idea, Luz!

09:52.600 --> 09:55.120
But will they have everything?
It's not too late?

09:55.200 --> 09:58.800
If working a double shift
helps save Cielo, we'll make it happen.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.040
Let's take advantage of Steffi's absence.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.960
How has your return been?

10:07.680 --> 10:08.840
Good.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.240
You haven't been since the competition?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.880
No. I haven't come back until now.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.240
Did you meet Steffi's mom here?

10:20.840 --> 10:21.680
Lyn?

10:23.040 --> 10:25.200
No. That was in Orlando.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.160
Steffi told me she also did wakeboarding.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.080
Lyn?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.560
Yes, but she never competed.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.720
They've never been here?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.440
No. I was always a single man here.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.600
I'm sure you were a heartthrob.
You must've broken more than one heart.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.880
Don't believe it, Tony.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.040
In fact, I was a little awkward
in that department.

10:53.840 --> 10:55.160
I don't believe that.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.240
There's a canal nearby that,
if you go in a canoe,

10:58.320 --> 11:01.080
you'll get to a beautiful forest,
ideal for camping.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.120
Cool.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.600
I can't imagine myself
setting up a camping tent.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.080
-Hopefully I'd be able to.
-You can do anything.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.920
You just have to try.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.560
Thinking about it,
you'd be a great adventure partner.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.080
Julián, one. Juan, zero.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.120
Don't listen to him.
Steffi said she loved the chocolates.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.440
Listen to her say,

11:25.960 --> 11:27.800
"What a romantic gesture."

11:27.880 --> 11:30.320
Really? So then, good or…

11:30.400 --> 11:32.120
You're almost there, Juan.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.680
Come on. Now a collab
I have my fans waiting for.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.080
Smile.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.120

<i>-Hi, twins.</i>

11:59.200 --> 12:01.960

12:06.360 --> 12:09.160
Excellent, boys.
We're gonna get millions of views.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.520
Awesome.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.360
I asked your dad about his trip
to Cielo Grande when he was young,

12:16.640 --> 12:17.680
and it confused me.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.800
-How so?
-How he didn't remember very well.

12:21.760 --> 12:22.680
When I was little,

12:22.760 --> 12:25.600
I was always asking him
about his win in Cielo Grande.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.800
He'd change the story.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.320
Who understands parents?

12:41.880 --> 12:42.760
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.800
I've been waiting
for you to wait on me for five minutes.

12:45.880 --> 12:46.720
Yeah, sorry.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.800
I'm alone. As soon as I'm free, I'll come.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.600
All right. Everyone can have a bad day.
I'll wait for you.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.560
Yeah, I'm coming.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.920
How are you? Sit over there, please.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.880
Hi.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.680
-Hi.
-I just finished class.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.600
-I came to work. Where do I start?
-Great. This table.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.680
-Okay.
-No, that's a lie. With this one.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.360
With this one or that one?

13:14.440 --> 13:16.520
I'm not used to giving instructions.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.000
Well, we traded places.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.280
Yes, you're right.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.040
-Take four's order, please.
-Okay.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.560
Thanks.

13:23.800 --> 13:24.640
All right.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.160
All right, over here.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.960
I'll bring the drinks now.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.320
Sorry.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.480
-We're always bumping into each other.
-Yeah, but we avoid tragedy.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.280
-Tragedy?
-Yeah.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.240
They say if you drop salt,
you could have bad luck.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.680
Forget that.
Nothing bad's gonna happen. Relax.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.520
-We're together.
-Okay.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
Awesome.

13:59.560 --> 14:03.560
I don't know if we should be here.
We're losing a day of training.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.160
You're always thinking about work, Tony.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.400
Or maybe you're waiting for Luz
to light up your life?

14:12.080 --> 14:12.920
Funny.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.160
Let's see if the boots fit you.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.320
Perfect. I must be the princess
you've been searching for.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.280
I just hope you don't turn
into a pumpkin at midnight.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.600
Finally some peace.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.520
-When do they get back from the wake park?
-What's going on? Do you miss someone?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.760
-Not at all. And you?
-No.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.560
-No?
-No.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.720
<i>No </i>no or no?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.720
No.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.760
I'm gonna get the salt.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.240
Wow! I love how you do the riff.
It's identical to how Skull does it.

15:07.320 --> 15:10.160
-Good.
-You even have the same profile.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.200
Really?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.920
I got tickets
to the "Burning Tires" farewell tour.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.720
-Do you want to go?
-Obviously.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.880
Skull.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.360
I'm coming.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.880
Noda's an artist, isn't he?

15:38.400 --> 15:41.000
The truth is he's awesome.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.800
I had something to show you.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.760
<i>This is the board.</i>

15:48.840 --> 15:51.280
<i>A technical stop</i>
<i>on the Cielo Grande adventure.</i>

15:51.360 --> 15:53.800
<i>About to get in the water</i>
<i>at the wake park.</i>

15:53.880 --> 15:55.640
I love it. Thanks.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.200
Now that they've mentioned Cielo Grande,

15:58.280 --> 16:01.200
I hope you won't bother me anymore
about the contract.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.720
-Awesome. You were awesome.
-Thanks.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.760
-I have a towel in case you're cold.
-No, I'm okay.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.800
And look what I made you.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.080
-With a lot of love.
-Thank you. Let's see.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
It's really good.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.880
-Yeah?
-Really. Thanks so much.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.240
So what did you think of the chocolate?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.520
-You're Juan.
-Juan, who sent the chocolate.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.400
Juan. Really good. Really. Thanks.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.200
Champion!

17:05.200 --> 17:07.720
What do you think
about a doubles challenge?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.560
-What's involved?
-I'll explain.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.200
-Let's find a table.
-Okay.

17:12.360 --> 17:13.200
Thanks.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.360
Julián, two. Juan, zero.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.360
Zero? I thought he had at least one point.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.280
Juan, this isn't working.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.720
-It's not, bro.
-I have an idea.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.040
Why not dedicate a song to Steffi?
That'll get you many points.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.360
Good idea.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.160
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:20.800 --> 19:22.360
You remind me of your mom.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.440
-Why?
-Your enthusiasm.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.000
So?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.120
Do you like it?

19:31.240 --> 19:33.640
At first, I had my doubts
about restoring it, but

19:35.080 --> 19:37.080
now I realize how much I missed it.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.080
I'm happy with how far it's come.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.400
-You're all doing great teamwork.
-But a lot's still needed.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.720
And to make it happen, we need everyone.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.280
I'm in. Count on me.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.040
Is that good?

19:54.640 --> 19:57.120
-It looks good. You want some?
-Okay.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.280
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

20:06.480 --> 20:08.600
-Do you want oil or vinegar?
-I have some.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.280
I'll leave it here in case.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.760
NATASHA
EN ROUTE TO CIELO GRANDE

20:19.920 --> 20:21.920
I'll leave this here for you.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.520
What's wrong?

20:26.560 --> 20:28.120
Nothing. A family thing.

20:29.080 --> 20:29.920
Be right back.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.800
I put the napkin here in case you spill.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.120
What's up, Luz? How are you? Listen.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.960
Do you know anything about Natasha Rossi?
I saw one of her stories.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.640
<i>Yeah, she just signed up</i>
<i>for the Summer Crush.</i>

20:46.720 --> 20:48.320
<i>Did she leave you a message?</i>

20:48.400 --> 20:51.120
No, it's nothing. I'll tell you later.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.600
Thanks, Luz.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.440
What do you think of this?

21:02.680 --> 21:04.000
"Day by day, I look for

21:05.320 --> 21:06.520
your gaze in mine."

21:08.040 --> 21:10.840
"A thousand steps from your love,
I must be."

21:12.600 --> 21:14.000
What a statement.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.160
You think so?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.160
No, it's good.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.040
Is it for Charly?

21:22.840 --> 21:24.360
Charly? No.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.560
Well, then you should tell me
who inspired all this.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.080
"I found love"?

22:36.080 --> 22:38.200
WHO ARE YOU?

22:38.280 --> 22:40.480
Are you the trophy Dad talks about?

22:55.200 --> 22:57.480
We heard you needed help finishing up.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.200
Yeah, and believe it or not,
we came to help.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.040
Great, guys.
We need all the help we can get. Thanks.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.000
-Yeah, Tony. Come on. Can you help me?
-Okay.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.000
-Steffi, could you help me with the sail?
-Of course.

23:09.080 --> 23:12.960
I studied fashion design for two years.
This can't be more complicated.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.320
Is this how you wear it?

23:39.200 --> 23:40.840
Are the rooms ready yet?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.000
Yes, three for Natasha's team. One for--

23:44.080 --> 23:45.280
Three rooms?

23:45.360 --> 23:48.000
Yes, the suite for Natasha,
another for her coach,

23:48.080 --> 23:50.000
and one for her physical therapist.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.880
-Hello. You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.400
I need you to go to the airport
to pick up an important competitor.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.320
Nice, Captain. Natasha Rossi, right?

23:59.400 --> 24:03.840
Well, news travels. I don't want
anything unexpected this time.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.720
All right. Okay. Let's go.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.160
This picture's great.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.280
Why don't we have a photo together?

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
That can be fixed very easily.

24:25.480 --> 24:30.880
No! I'm definitely sticking
with "Your Mom," of course.

24:30.960 --> 24:35.040
From '86. Great song. But that's the year
they broke up. No good.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.480
-Not good.
-No.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.160
It seems we were born in the wrong decade.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.960
-I have a signed album from them.
-What?

24:45.040 --> 24:47.200
-I have a signed album from them.
-What?

24:47.280 --> 24:48.320
-I have a--
-Show me.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
All right.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.160
<i>Lovebirds, I'm recording.</i>

24:56.240 --> 24:58.160
We make the perfect couple, don't we?

25:09.880 --> 25:10.840
Natasha Rossi?

25:13.640 --> 25:14.800
I think I'm in love.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.600
Tell Steffi if she wants to hide from me,
she shouldn't post.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.920
-You shouldn't have come.
-And let you win this little tournament?

25:26.080 --> 25:27.320
Please.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.000
And also tell your little friend
her ex says hello.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.640
-What did you say?
-Hey!

25:32.720 --> 25:34.680
Don't sink down to her level.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.360
You're right. Vacation is over.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.000
Tomorrow morning
we start training seriously.
