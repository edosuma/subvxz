WEBVTT

00:10.778 --> 00:13.381
- Aw, man, I wanted to do that.

00:13.481 --> 00:14.982
- My friend Christine
from Metroburg

00:15.083 --> 00:17.451
got her superhero cape
and had a cape ceremony.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.120
Look.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.122
How am I getting my cape
after Christine?

00:21.222 --> 00:24.158
Her superpower is
super-hearing. That is so lame.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.560
- [text tone dings]

00:26.660 --> 00:31.365
- Whoops, she heard that.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.234
- All right, you two,
go do your homework,

00:33.334 --> 00:35.035
so you can enjoy the weekend.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.071
- NORA: Cool!
- BILLY: Nice cape!

00:37.171 --> 00:38.772
- Or do that.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.942
- Aw, Christine looks so cute
in her superhero cape.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.577
- [text tone ringing]

00:43.677 --> 00:45.779
- She says "Thanks!"

00:45.879 --> 00:48.249
- Oh, her parents
must be so proud.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.751
Not that we aren't proud of
what you've been doing,

00:50.851 --> 00:53.121
hashtagging, shopping,
yolo'ing.

00:53.221 --> 00:56.590
Oh, ho, you've
been crushin' it.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.692
- All right, I suppose if I had
chosen to focus more

00:58.792 --> 01:02.430
on superhero training, then I'd
be getting my cape by now, too.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.434
- Do what I do--tie a blanket
around your neck and say...

01:06.534 --> 01:08.736
We-e-e-e-e!

01:08.836 --> 01:13.006
- We-e-e-e-e is also
the size of his brain.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.875
- These are special
capes, Billy.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.777
The Hero League awards
them to you.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.679
- Yeah, it's part of becoming
a full superhero.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.449
You also get access
to weapons and then later

01:21.549 --> 01:23.417
you get your hero name
and a supervillain to beat up.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.386
[inhales through teeth]
I hope I get Max.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.456
- You can't handle
all this evil.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.758
[slurping]

01:30.858 --> 01:32.860
[sputtering]

01:38.499 --> 01:40.501
- Maybe it's not too late.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.871
The Hero League still has one
more cape to award this year.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.074
Not that I've been looking
into it on a daily basis.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.409
- Getting my cape
would be awesome.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.179
Before we moved here,
it's all I ever dreamed about.

01:51.212 --> 01:55.183
That, and ice skating
with Channing Tatum.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.017
- I want a superhero cape.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.419
- Me, too.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.622
One without dad's
nacho stains.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.257
- It's never too early to start.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.293
You've just gotta earn it
through lots of training

02:05.393 --> 02:07.795
and showing admirable
superhero behavior.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.364
- Oh, like catching
someone when they fall.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.267
Billy, fall backwards.
- Okay.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.003
- [heavy thud]

02:16.103 --> 02:18.572
- Phoebe, where were you?

02:20.073 --> 02:22.210
- *

02:22.310 --> 02:23.477
* What you see

02:23.577 --> 02:25.213
* Is not what you get

02:25.246 --> 02:28.282
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:28.382 --> 02:30.017
* We fit right in

02:30.117 --> 02:31.485
* Bet you never guessed

02:31.585 --> 02:33.020
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:33.120 --> 02:34.622
* Just like all the rest

02:34.722 --> 02:36.357
* A picture
perfect family *

02:36.457 --> 02:38.492
* Is what we try to be

02:38.592 --> 02:39.860
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:39.960 --> 02:41.495
* The crazy things we do

02:41.595 --> 02:43.231
* This isn't
make believe *

02:43.297 --> 02:44.932
* It's our reality

02:45.032 --> 02:46.400
* Just your average family

02:46.500 --> 02:49.437
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:49.537 --> 02:53.307
* Livin' a double life

02:58.045 --> 03:01.382
to save Hiddenville's woodland
creatures from a brush fire.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.752
I'm gonna get my cape,
too, Christine.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.053
- [text tone ringing]

03:06.153 --> 03:09.923
- Christine says,
"You don't have to yell."

03:10.023 --> 03:12.025
If you wanna do a good deed,
help me find dad's wallet.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.727
I need twenty bucks
for the party.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.864
- What party?
The party? That's tonight?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.766
I told all my
friends I was gonna go.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.568
- How could you forget
about the first-ever

03:20.668 --> 03:22.470
secret rooftop party
in school history?

03:22.570 --> 03:26.407
It's illegal and unsafe
and I can't wait!

03:26.507 --> 03:27.675
- I can't go now.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.710
If mom and dad found out
I went to that party,

03:29.810 --> 03:31.912
they would never let me
accept the superhero cape.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.315
- Jackpot.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.317
- Although, there's nothing
like dancing on a roof

03:36.417 --> 03:38.352
after putting out
a brush fire.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.154
- Thank you, Bank of Hank.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.558
- Yeah, just give me five
minutes to change and--

03:44.658 --> 03:46.927
Okay, I'll meet ya there!

03:47.027 --> 03:48.696
- Hey, Phoebs.
- [gasping]

03:48.796 --> 03:50.431
- You were out
savin' the world, I see.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.899
- You'll be happy to hear

03:51.999 --> 03:53.834
all your good deeds
have been reported.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.869
Won't be long before
President Kickbutt calls.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.071
- Great.
- Where are you going now?

03:58.171 --> 04:00.040
- Oh, I'm off to rescue
beached old people

04:00.140 --> 04:03.711
and help whales
cross the street.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.414
- Somebody's got
cape on the brain.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.781
- Well, she's not
the only one.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.584
Let's go check on our
junior superheroes.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.820
- Have you seen my wallet?

04:13.421 --> 04:18.359
- *

04:18.459 --> 04:21.895
- Billy, Nora,
what's all this?

04:21.995 --> 04:25.232
- We're getting ready
to sleep in the wild.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.701
- Yeah, you said surviving
a night by ourselves

04:27.801 --> 04:30.237
is the first step in getting
our superhero capes.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.973
- BOTH: Roughing it!
- [glasses clinking]

04:33.073 --> 04:35.809
- Kids, it's supposed
to be a challenge.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.210
- Do you know how hard it was

04:37.345 --> 04:40.047
getting that
mini-fridge out here?

04:40.147 --> 04:43.250
- Look, your mother is right.
Uh, this is about surviving.

04:43.351 --> 04:46.219
Not to brag, but I set
the record by surviving

04:46.354 --> 04:48.889
three nights in the wild
when I was your age.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.525
Well, actually, I was
two years younger.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.094
- That's enough bragging part.

04:54.194 --> 04:57.565
- I'm just saying it's about
depending on your own skills,

04:57.665 --> 05:00.033
not the comforts of home.
- [loud buzzing]

05:00.133 --> 05:03.270
- Sorry, Dad, I can't hear
you over the foot spa.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.938
- [turns off spa]

05:05.038 --> 05:06.740
He said you can't have
all this stuff.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.610
- Then what can we have?

05:13.381 --> 05:15.483
- I can't do this!

05:15.583 --> 05:16.950
- Yes, you can.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.453
All we need is
a place to sleep.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.888
[powers zapping]

05:20.988 --> 05:23.557
- [branches thudding]

05:23.657 --> 05:25.926
- Okay, Billy, build
us a fort.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.929
- BILLY: [zooming]

05:30.864 --> 05:32.933
Whoa, I did it.

05:33.033 --> 05:37.270
I am Billy,
Lord of the Outdoors!

05:37.405 --> 05:39.673
- [owl hooting]

05:39.773 --> 05:41.942
- BOTH: [screaming]

05:45.546 --> 05:48.982
- [loud dance music playing]

05:50.551 --> 05:53.186
- I'm really excited about you
getting this cape, Phoebe.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.022
- What?
Oh, let me guess.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.824
Your "excitement"
is because you want access

05:56.924 --> 05:58.526
to the superhero weapons.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.529
- Absolutely.
Here's a list.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.997
- All right, fine, I'll put this
in a safe place for you.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.434
[breathing fire]

06:08.235 --> 06:10.904
- [loud music continues]

06:11.004 --> 06:12.873
- [metal clanking]

06:12.973 --> 06:15.042
- Whoa. Uh...

06:15.142 --> 06:16.777
- That looks bad.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.946
- I know. Those chips are gonna
be all crumbs when he falls.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.614
- Whoaaa!

06:20.714 --> 06:23.116
- [ladder creaking]

06:23.216 --> 06:25.753
[ladder thudding heavily]

06:27.621 --> 06:29.089
- Whew.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.091
Oh, you don't think anyone
saw me, do you, Max?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.461
- [chomping chip]
- Max?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.529
- Oh, baked chips?

06:35.629 --> 06:37.865
You shoulda let him fall.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.200
Come on. I know
another way up.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.171
- *

06:44.271 --> 06:46.173
- PHOEBE: Max, are you
down there?

06:46.273 --> 06:47.975
- COLOSSO: Tell her "No."

06:48.075 --> 06:49.142
- We've got a mess on our hands.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.479
Somebody recorded
everything last night.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.715
- Including me bringing
back The Cabbage Patch?

06:56.283 --> 06:59.052
- Not that mess.
This mess.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.255
- [reading] "Miracle Wind
Saves Rooftop Partier."

07:02.355 --> 07:04.157
- BOY ON LADDER: Whoaaa!

07:04.257 --> 07:07.160
- The video's gone viral.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.262
If mom and dad see it, they'll
know it was telekinesis

07:09.362 --> 07:10.731
and realize I snuck
out to the party

07:10.831 --> 07:12.032
and it's bye-bye cape.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.267
- Mom and dad are
like 70 years old.

07:14.367 --> 07:17.270
They don't watch viral videos.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.407
- I just saw a viral video
on the morning news.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.309
I'm getting your father
and the four of us...

07:22.409 --> 07:25.112
we're gonna have a talk.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.114
- You forgot about
the morning news.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.282
It's the internet
for old people.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.123
- It's morning.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.526
We're alive.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.593
We did it, Nora.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.229
- We did! We survived
the whole night!

07:42.329 --> 07:45.666
- Well, good morning, you two.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.434
Hey, nice shelter.

07:47.535 --> 07:50.938
Of course, mine was rain-proof,
but what do I know?

07:51.038 --> 07:53.541
I only hold the record.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.375
Anyway, to celebrate your
accomplishment,

07:55.543 --> 07:57.778
I thought you might want
to see my trophy.

07:57.878 --> 08:01.248
Whoa, "see" my trophy.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.250
Only record holders
get to touch it.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.353
[blowing air]

08:06.453 --> 08:09.557
- You know, Nora, staying
outside wasn't so bad--

08:09.623 --> 08:13.927
once we got past the sobbing
and figured out where to pee.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.997
- You're right. Wanna break
dad's record of three nights?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.299
- Totally.
- What's that?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.069
- Hank, we have a problem.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.104
- I know. Billy and Nora
want my trophy.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.740
- Because it was made
for children.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.441
Come on.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.579
- The trophy-less
are a bitter people.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.917
- BOY ON LADDER: Whoaaa!
- [ladder creaking]

08:37.017 --> 08:39.419
- Is that what I think it is?

08:39.587 --> 08:42.355
- Yep, miracle wind.
Give it up for Mother Nature.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.057
- PHOEBE & MAX: [applauding]

08:44.157 --> 08:45.492
- That wasn't wind.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.961
Monitor, play the infrared.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.863
- Whoaaa!

08:49.963 --> 08:51.832
- [powers vibrating]

08:51.932 --> 08:54.034
- [ladder creaking]
[ladder thudding heavily]

08:54.134 --> 08:55.636
- Telekinetic waves?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.671
Somebody better start talking.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.707
- All right, fine,
here's the deal.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.942
Even though I did all those
great things yesterday,

09:02.042 --> 09:03.510
you should also know that--

09:03.611 --> 09:05.779
- I saved that kid.
- Max saved that kid.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.881
Wait? What?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.817
- Sorry, it was me.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.386
I was the hero
who saved that idiot.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.055
- So, let me get this straight.

09:15.155 --> 09:20.427
Max Thunderman saw someone
in danger and saved them?

09:20.527 --> 09:23.731
- Seems to be what
we're going with.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.833
- On purpose?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.534
- All right, I get it.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.437
You guys don't think I can do
something heroic, but I did.

09:30.537 --> 09:34.141
- Barb, do you know
what this means?

09:34.241 --> 09:37.377
- [fanfare music]
- HANK: [laughing]

09:37.477 --> 09:39.847
- BARB: [screaming]

09:40.748 --> 09:43.851
- HANK & BARB:
The phase is over!

09:43.951 --> 09:45.653
- BARB: [cheering]

09:45.719 --> 09:48.055
- We always knew you
had it in ya, pal.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.823
[kissing]
- Ugh.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.458
- Let's call the Hero
League and tell them

09:51.558 --> 09:55.929
we have two teen heroes
in the family!

09:59.532 --> 10:01.368
- What are you up to?

10:01.468 --> 10:02.870
- I wanna make sure
you get your cape.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.271
And in return,
you'll give me access

10:04.371 --> 10:05.706
to the Hero League weapons.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.675
- I already told you
that's not gonna happen.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.276
- Oh, then, I'll just
tell mom and dad

10:09.376 --> 10:11.178
that you snuck out
to the party.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.280
Bye-bye cape.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.282
- Oh! Fine!

10:15.382 --> 10:17.284
You can play with
one weapon for one hour.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.787
- Oh, goody! Goody!

10:19.887 --> 10:22.790
- The Hero League
is so excited, Max.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.325
- At first, they didn't believe
it and hung up on us.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.260
But then we called back
and convinced them.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.862
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

10:28.962 --> 10:32.432
Incoming transmission from
Super President Kickbutt.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.334
- Super President Kickbutt!

10:34.434 --> 10:36.203
Phoebe, this is it!
I told you she'd call.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.438
Be cool.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.240
- Hello, Thundermans.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.843
- HANK: Hi!
[giggling]

10:42.943 --> 10:45.312
- Phoebe, we're all
very impressed with

10:45.412 --> 10:47.948
your recent run
of superhero deeds.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.950
Truly exemplary.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.152
- Phoebe, you're gonna
get your cape.

10:52.252 --> 10:55.956
- And, now, it is with great
pleasure that I announce

10:56.056 --> 11:00.227
the last superhero cape of
the year is going to...

11:00.327 --> 11:02.062
- Here it comes.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.496
- ...Max Thunderman!

11:03.596 --> 11:06.233
- ALL: Huh?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.201
- Did someone say my name?

11:14.041 --> 11:18.378
- Wait. So I'm getting
the last cape of the year?

11:18.478 --> 11:22.850
I am so armed--
I mean, honored.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.218
- There's gotta be
some mistake.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.755
Here, check the name again.
It's Phoebe. P-h-o...

11:27.821 --> 11:29.589
- There's no mistake.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.825
Max's unexpected act of heroism

11:31.925 --> 11:35.763
catapulted him to
to the top of the list.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.099
- ...e-b-e.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.269
As in Phoebe should
get that cape.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.072
- I'll see you all at
Max's cape ceremony.

11:45.172 --> 11:49.542
Super President Kickbutt out!

11:49.642 --> 11:52.479
- Phoebe, I know
it's hard, but...

11:52.579 --> 11:54.114
try to be happy for Max.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.784
- But you guys do realize that
for Max to save that kid,

11:56.850 --> 11:59.052
he went to a party...

11:59.152 --> 12:00.587
at our school...

12:00.788 --> 12:02.689
on a roof.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.992
- Ah, that's just Max.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.493
- Well, the old Max.

12:06.593 --> 12:11.331
- Good riddance to that guy.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.333
- Now if you'd have
gone to that party,

12:13.433 --> 12:16.336
you'd be in big trouble,
but you didn't...

12:16.436 --> 12:19.339
'cause you're a good girl.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.608
- Now I can say it, Barb.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.710
All our kids are good!

12:23.811 --> 12:26.313
- Come on, we've got
a cape ceremony to plan!

12:26.413 --> 12:28.181
- HANK: Oh!

12:31.018 --> 12:33.420
- What?
I did you a favor.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.655
Now you don't have to lend me
those weapons anymore--

12:35.823 --> 12:37.390
'cause I can get 'em myself.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.359
You're welcome.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.833
- Billy!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.868
You ate all the granola.

12:47.968 --> 12:51.171
How are we supposed
to survive without food?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.874
- That was food?

12:53.974 --> 12:55.843
- Oh, hey, guys.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.244
Are you still out here?

12:57.344 --> 12:59.279
I totally forgot.

12:59.379 --> 13:05.152
Since I'm here, would you like
this giant cookie I baked?

13:05.252 --> 13:06.954
- Yes!

13:07.054 --> 13:08.221
- Billy, stop!

13:08.321 --> 13:10.891
He's trying to trick us
into going into the house.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.160
He doesn't want us
to break his record.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.863
- Did I forget to mention
I baked little cookies

13:15.929 --> 13:19.666
inside the big cookie?

13:19.766 --> 13:24.037
- There's inside cookies?

13:24.137 --> 13:28.341
- We're not playing your
hunger games, old man.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.178
- Fine! But you'll
never get my trophy.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.414
Or this!
- [shoe thudding cookie]

13:41.021 --> 13:43.023
- Oh, if I can prove
Max is still evil,

13:43.123 --> 13:46.226
he'll never get
that cape--and I will.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.496
- You won't find anything.
Max covered his tracks.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.332
He's become the face
for reformed teen villains.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.440
- Oh, yeah? Well,
if he's so reformed,

14:00.540 --> 14:04.211
then why is his Dark Mayhem
poster right under this one?

14:07.580 --> 14:10.783
- Here comes Captain
Happy Pants now.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.685
- Hey! Hey! Phoebs!

14:12.785 --> 14:14.287
- Stuff it, Max.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.156
- Easy. We don't use
that kind of language

14:16.256 --> 14:19.292
down here in the Hero Lounge.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.760
- Max, you've gotta stop this.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.996
Sometimes when a supervillain
pretends to be good,

14:23.096 --> 14:25.532
he becomes good without
even knowing it.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.700
It happened to
the Big Belly Bandit.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.002
- Who?

14:29.102 --> 14:34.674
- You know him by
his new name--Santa Claus.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.309
- Colosso, relax.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.311
I told you already
I'm just acting like this

14:38.411 --> 14:40.180
until I get those weapons.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.949
Now you guys hang in there.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.986
If I can do it, so can you.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.956
- It's too much!
You're just reading posters!

14:49.056 --> 14:51.391
- MAX: Teamwork!

14:51.491 --> 14:53.593
- He's taking this too far.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.561
- Mmmm, I don't know.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.265
With my help, he can go
a little further.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.732
- What does that mean?

14:59.832 --> 15:01.401
Get back here!

15:01.501 --> 15:04.371
Max always shares
his plans with me!

15:04.471 --> 15:08.408
- *

15:08.508 --> 15:11.578
- Such a help, Mr. Hero Man.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.313
- When I see a damsel
in distress,

15:13.413 --> 15:16.583
I come a-runnin'.
- Oh...

15:21.321 --> 15:23.991
- Helping mom, huh?
Maybe Colosso was right.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.994
When you pretend to be good,
you actually become good.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.662
- Please. My heart
is as black as ever.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.464
- [coaster zooming]

15:31.564 --> 15:33.833
- Really? If you're
still so evil,

15:34.001 --> 15:35.202
then why are you
using a coaster?

15:35.302 --> 15:39.139
- I've never used
a coaster in my life.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.573
How'd that get there?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.010
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

15:43.076 --> 15:45.478
Cable technicians approaching.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.481
- Oh, ho, ho!
I know who this is!

15:55.122 --> 15:58.725
- [scanner humming]

15:58.825 --> 16:00.693
- Perimeter's secure.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.832
- [velcro ripping]

16:07.800 --> 16:10.837
- Super President Kickbutt,
always a pleasure.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.741
- It's a tremendous day
for the Thunderman family.

16:14.841 --> 16:18.311
Simone, I asked you to
wear your super suit.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.282
- You're not the president
of my closet.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.084
- Sorry about my daughter.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.253
She has a bit of
a dark side.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.455
I'm hoping Max can inspire her.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.491
- Oh, well, he inspires
us every day.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.461
Well, since yesterday.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.267
- You're probably wondering
where Billy and Nora are.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.934
- Who?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.770
- You're right.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.806
I'll let them know you insisted
I bring them inside.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.377
- Hey, hey, hey, Super Prez.
I love your hair.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.979
- Max is still getting the cape.
- Okay. Good talk.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.984
- Billy! Nora!

16:58.085 --> 17:03.156
Super President Kickbutt is here
and has ordered you two inside.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.757
- Super President Kickbutt
is here?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.093
Yeah, right.

17:06.126 --> 17:10.830
- She's here because Max
is getting his superhero cape.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.365
- BOTH: [laughing]

17:12.465 --> 17:14.834
- You're pathetic.

17:14.934 --> 17:18.438
We'll come inside after we erase
you from the history books.

17:24.477 --> 17:29.616
- Dr. Colosso.
- Evelyn.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.353
- PHOEBE: [powers zapping]
- SIMONE: Whoa!

17:33.453 --> 17:34.854
- ALL: [applauding]
- Name's Simone.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.289
And, no, I don't have
a boyfriend.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.758
[laughing]

17:42.429 --> 17:43.963
- Good catch.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.166
Your hero instincts kicked
in pretty fast just then.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.135
- Those weren't hero instincts.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.203
Those were my evil guy

17:50.303 --> 17:53.306
pretending-to-be-a-hero
instincts.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.142
I'm in character.

17:55.242 --> 17:59.011
- Or is the character in you?

17:59.146 --> 18:02.715
- Okay, there's no way
I'll ever be good.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.852
See mom's ham she's been
slow-roasting for two days?

18:05.952 --> 18:08.421
- [powers zapping]
- [ham thudding]

18:08.521 --> 18:10.623
- Now would a real
hero do that?

18:10.723 --> 18:15.295
- Holy flying pig, yes!

18:15.395 --> 18:16.863
- MAX: What the heck?

18:16.963 --> 18:21.634
- Thanks, Max!
You're a hero!

18:21.734 --> 18:23.170
- Look at that.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.338
Even when you try being
bad, it turns out good.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.374
- No, no, that's
not what I--

18:27.474 --> 18:29.008
Can't we just--

18:29.176 --> 18:32.312
Get outta my head!

18:32.412 --> 18:36.449
- We gather here today
to bestow upon Max Thunderman

18:36.549 --> 18:39.452
his superhero cape!

18:39.552 --> 18:43.022
- Not gonna happen,
President Stinkbutt!

18:43.190 --> 18:46.826
- [laughing]
That's what I used to call her.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.595
- Max, what are you doing?

18:48.695 --> 18:50.597
- I am not a superhero.

18:50.697 --> 18:51.998
- Aw, he's got cape fear.

18:52.098 --> 18:54.334
Don't worry, honey,
it happens to all of us.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.369
Come on, put your
cape on for mommy.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.837
- No!

18:57.937 --> 19:00.207
I am evil and always
have been.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.941
And President Kickbutt here

19:02.041 --> 19:03.910
is gonna take me
to get some weapons!

19:04.010 --> 19:05.845
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
[gasping]

19:05.945 --> 19:08.615
You realize you're making
a horrible mistake, right?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.717
- Zip it, Evelyn.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.719
- SIMONE: Kick butt!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.487
- MAX: Ah!
[zooming]

19:14.587 --> 19:16.556
- [plaster thudding]

19:16.656 --> 19:19.459
- Yeah! That felt awesome!

19:22.595 --> 19:24.697
- Our bellies are full.

19:24.797 --> 19:28.235
Nothing can stop us now from
breaking dad's record.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.336
- MAX: Ahhhhhh!

19:29.436 --> 19:31.904
- [heavy thud]

19:32.004 --> 19:34.807
- BOTH: [screaming]

19:39.379 --> 19:42.849
- Super President Kickbutt,
my sincere apologies.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.418
My son's behavior was
unacceptable.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.587
If anything, the Thundermans

19:47.687 --> 19:51.458
are pillars of dignity
and respect.

19:51.558 --> 19:54.060
- NORA & BILLY: [screaming]

19:54.160 --> 19:57.530
- Ha, ha, you two came
in ten seconds too soon!

19:57.630 --> 19:58.865
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.633
Ma record still stands!

20:00.733 --> 20:03.270
Too bad! So sad!

20:03.370 --> 20:04.537
- NORA: [powers zapping]

20:04.637 --> 20:07.240
- HANK: [screaming]

20:07.340 --> 20:10.277
Oh...oh...oh...

20:10.377 --> 20:14.447
- Too bad!
- So sad!

20:14.547 --> 20:16.849
- This place is a mad house.

20:16.949 --> 20:20.119
- I could not agree more.
So, about my cape ceremony.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.456
Should we reschedule or just
roll on into it right now?

20:23.556 --> 20:28.060
- I'm giving the cape to
the person who just saved me.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.798
- Wait, Simone?
- Mm-hm. S-i-m--

20:31.898 --> 20:34.334
- I know how it's spelled!
- SIMONE: [laughing]

20:34.434 --> 20:38.137
- Super President Kickbutt out!
[snapping fingers]

20:39.539 --> 20:41.974
- PHOEBE: [groaning]

20:42.074 --> 20:45.978
- [whining]
Oh, mommy, I need a hug.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.747
- Don't "Mommy" me.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.716
You just embarrassed
our entire family.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.484
- Me? What about Phoebe?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.653
She's the one who saved that
dumb kid from falling.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.788
She's the real embarrassment.
- Wait.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.124
- What was that?

20:58.224 --> 21:00.026
- Uh...

21:00.126 --> 21:05.565
Clearly, he is delirious
from the butt trauma.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.334
Okay, fine.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.636
I'm the one who saved
the kid at that party.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.804
- Phoebe, why?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.540
- Because he was falling?

21:13.640 --> 21:16.242
- No, I mean, why'd you let Max
take credit for your save?

21:16.343 --> 21:18.411
- Well, I didn't want
you guys to know

21:18.511 --> 21:20.112
I snuck out to the party.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.114
Look, I'm really sorry I lied.
It's just that...

21:22.214 --> 21:24.016
I really want my superhero cape,

21:24.116 --> 21:27.119
but I also wanna be out
there dancin' on rooftops.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.522
- You've been on more
than one rooftop?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.359
- I got this.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.026
It's okay, sweetie.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.195
I mean, part of being
a superhero

21:36.363 --> 21:38.665
is juggling your hero life
with your regular life.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.066
You'll get your cape.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.402
It just may take longer.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.371
- Thanks, Mom.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.839
So, does that mean if there's
another rooftop party,

21:46.939 --> 21:49.842
I can go?
- Oh, sure.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.077
Oh, as a matter of fact,

21:51.177 --> 21:54.046
there's one happenin'
right now on our roof.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.616
You can patch that
Max-shaped hole

21:56.716 --> 21:58.985
while Max sits here
and watches.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.587
- What? Sits and watches?

22:00.687 --> 22:02.288
How is that a punishment?

22:02.389 --> 22:04.791
- Max, sit.

22:04.891 --> 22:08.661
- [screaming]
Oh, my butt!

22:12.465 --> 22:27.814
- *
