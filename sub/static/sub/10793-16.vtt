WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:03.300
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.835 --> 00:06.537
We are going to survive.

00:06.538 --> 00:09.540
We are going to make it home.

00:09.541 --> 00:13.478
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason.

00:13.479 --> 00:16.881
Destiny is powered
by the stars themselves.

00:16.882 --> 00:19.217
He and Young are
bumping heads, yes.

00:19.218 --> 00:21.120
Not sure which camp
is the better choice.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.454
We just pretend
nothing happened.

00:23.455 --> 00:26.324
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

00:26.325 --> 00:27.725
For the sake of the crew.

00:27.726 --> 00:30.194
For the sake of the crew.

00:30.195 --> 00:32.197
Well, the convulsions
have stopped,

00:32.198 --> 00:33.799
but he's completely
unresponsive.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.834
He's basically in
a deep catatonic state.

00:35.835 --> 00:37.369
<i>This is Scott, sir.</i>

00:37.370 --> 00:39.873
<i>We are in a bit of
a pickle down here.</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:41.808
We haven't found
any other sort of exit

00:41.809 --> 00:43.242
or access to ground level.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.378
We've got less
than half an hour.

00:44.379 --> 00:46.113
We're not going to make it.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.814
They just jumped.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.150
God be with you, Colonel.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.019
All of you.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.080 --> 01:18.914
<i>Colonel Young?</i>

01:20.116 --> 01:21.850
<i>Colonel Young?</i>

01:26.523 --> 01:27.457
Yeah.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.691
<i>We're all here, sir.</i>

01:28.692 --> 01:31.260
I'm on my way.

01:54.153 --> 01:56.587
Dr. Rush has
just confirmed

01:56.588 --> 01:59.357
that our current FTL jump

01:59.358 --> 02:02.328
will take us between galaxies.

02:02.329 --> 02:05.231
Which means it could
take some time

02:05.232 --> 02:07.733
before we are able to make
another gate connection

02:07.734 --> 02:09.936
to replenish our supplies.

02:09.937 --> 02:13.907
Strict food and water
rationing will be reinstated

02:13.908 --> 02:15.208
as of now.

02:15.209 --> 02:16.843
It also means

02:16.844 --> 02:20.847
that any hope of
rescuing Chloe Armstrong,

02:20.848 --> 02:25.320
Eli Wallace,
or Lt. Matthew Scott is...

02:32.962 --> 02:34.929
<i>Colonel Young,</i>

02:34.930 --> 02:36.764
<i>would you please join me in
the control interface room?</i>

02:36.765 --> 02:39.902
I'll be right there.

02:39.903 --> 02:42.304
That is all.

02:58.923 --> 03:00.557
I've figured out

03:00.558 --> 03:02.525
Why the ship's been trying
to conserve power.

03:02.526 --> 03:04.929
We're going to fall short.

03:04.930 --> 03:06.797
Short of what?

03:06.798 --> 03:08.532
Our destination,
the other galaxy.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.267
No matter
how I do the sums,

03:10.268 --> 03:12.003
and to what degree
I try and conserve power,

03:12.004 --> 03:15.974
Destiny won't make
it across the void.

03:24.016 --> 03:30.817
STARGATE UNIVERSE
s01e16 - Sabotage

03:34.323 --> 03:36.424
But we just passed
through a star.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.759
We should be recharged.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.194
Yes, we did, but like
everything else on this ship,

03:40.195 --> 03:42.197
Destiny's FTL drive
and power reserves

03:42.198 --> 03:44.067
are nowhere near 100%.

03:44.068 --> 03:46.101
The database says
the ship barely made

03:46.102 --> 03:47.670
the last three or four
intergalactic jumps.

03:47.671 --> 03:49.672
Recent battle damage
couldn't have helped.

03:49.673 --> 03:51.573
But if the ship realizes
that it can't make it,

03:51.574 --> 03:53.009
why is it trying?

03:53.010 --> 03:57.113
It's programmed to follow
a predetermined path.

03:57.114 --> 03:59.115
Since we haven't managed
to take control of the ship,

03:59.116 --> 04:01.718
our presence is
secondary to that.

04:01.719 --> 04:04.120
Destiny will eventually
drift the rest of the way,

04:04.121 --> 04:07.792
but our bones
will be dust by then.

04:07.793 --> 04:09.727
So, what do we do?

04:09.728 --> 04:11.796
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

04:13.098 --> 04:14.665
How much will we
fall short?

04:14.666 --> 04:17.834
50,000 light years,
give or take.

04:17.836 --> 04:18.870
Just a few percent
of the total.

04:18.870 --> 04:20.471
Yeah.

04:20.473 --> 04:24.142
So, what if we can increase
the FTL drive's efficiency?

04:24.143 --> 04:26.278
Work better
with the same amount of power.

04:26.279 --> 04:29.114
Yeah, five percent
would do it, actually.

04:29.115 --> 04:30.449
We don't know how
the engines work,

04:30.450 --> 04:31.617
At all.

04:31.618 --> 04:32.752
We could just
make things worse.

04:32.753 --> 04:34.654
Mr. Brody's right.

04:34.655 --> 04:36.189
So am I the only one here
who thinks

04:36.190 --> 04:37.757
We shouldn't be screwing around
with ancient drive technology

04:37.758 --> 04:40.159
Unless we have a clue
about what we're doing?

04:40.160 --> 04:41.661
Then we'll bring aboard
someone else that does.

04:41.662 --> 04:42.895
I can think of two or three
people off the top of my head.

04:42.896 --> 04:43.831
Who's the best?

04:43.832 --> 04:45.566
Amanda Perry.

04:47.702 --> 04:48.902
She was part
of the team

04:48.903 --> 04:50.637
helping to design

04:50.638 --> 04:52.239
the next generation
of hyperdrives.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.174
There's really no one
better qualified.

04:54.175 --> 04:55.409
Well, let's make that happen.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.178
Let's make arrangements
to get her on board.

04:57.179 --> 04:59.581
Colonel...

04:59.582 --> 05:01.649
For all her abilities,

05:01.650 --> 05:04.486
there are certain disabilities

05:04.487 --> 05:06.388
of which you should
be made aware.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.189
For how long?

05:08.190 --> 05:10.693
Potentially
several weeks.

05:10.694 --> 05:11.894
Of course, there'll be
someone to assist

05:11.895 --> 05:15.364
with the day to day things.

05:15.365 --> 05:17.533
She requires
a respirator

05:17.534 --> 05:19.235
in order to breathe.

05:19.236 --> 05:20.770
Obviously,

05:20.771 --> 05:22.406
there's going to be
some kind of adjustment.

05:22.407 --> 05:24.641
Will I be able to
see my family?

05:24.642 --> 05:26.243
They've got clearance.

05:26.244 --> 05:28.879
Then I'll do it, sir.

05:46.366 --> 05:47.633
Lieutenant?

05:47.634 --> 05:48.934
You all right?

05:48.935 --> 05:51.970
Mandy...

05:54.274 --> 05:55.407
Nick.

05:55.408 --> 05:57.776
Yeah.

06:04.218 --> 06:05.985
God, I'm really here, aren't I?

06:05.986 --> 06:09.656
You sure are.

06:09.657 --> 06:10.857
It takes a moment

06:10.858 --> 06:13.994
To get used to
the transfer.

06:13.995 --> 06:15.663
You're telling me.

06:21.403 --> 06:22.703
I'm sorry, sir.

06:22.704 --> 06:24.372
I couldn't do it.

06:24.373 --> 06:25.407
Lieutenant...

06:25.408 --> 06:26.875
Just leave her. Leave her.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.950
So Lieutenant James
had trouble

06:34.951 --> 06:37.353
Getting used to
the ventilator.

06:38.755 --> 06:40.022
I'll be fine.

06:44.361 --> 06:46.496
Fix the ship.

06:52.570 --> 06:53.704
Ms. Wray?

06:56.641 --> 06:58.008
Yes.

06:58.009 --> 07:00.577
Good. Take all the time
you need to adjust.

07:00.578 --> 07:01.712
This is mary.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.881
She'll be your helper
while you're here.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.082
Hello.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.417
She'll also brief you
on h to cope

07:06.418 --> 07:07.886
With your host's disabilities.

07:07.887 --> 07:09.587
Afterwards, Dr. Strom
was hoping to see you...

07:09.588 --> 07:10.588
No.

07:11.991 --> 07:13.691
I'm going home.

07:20.567 --> 07:24.436
Hey...

07:24.437 --> 07:25.704
I couldn't do it.

07:25.705 --> 07:29.476
Yeah, I know. I heard.

07:30.678 --> 07:32.546
It's okay.

07:32.547 --> 07:35.415
No, it isn't.

07:35.416 --> 07:36.850
I let him down.

07:36.851 --> 07:38.652
The Colonel?

07:38.653 --> 07:41.722
Hey, listen,
he's the last person that...

07:48.730 --> 07:50.765
I recognize you.

07:52.635 --> 07:53.635
Excuse me.

07:53.636 --> 07:55.037
As I was saying,
this is the mess hall,

07:55.038 --> 07:56.438
One of the places
you probably want to try

07:56.439 --> 07:57.606
and avoid, really.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.374
What are those?

07:59.375 --> 08:01.710
They're
a kind of fruit

08:01.711 --> 08:04.513
we collected from a planet
we visited recently.

08:04.514 --> 08:06.883
May I try one?

08:08.552 --> 08:10.653
I'll warn you,

08:10.654 --> 08:13.756
most people find
these rather bitter.

08:20.632 --> 08:23.033
Most people spit
them right back out.

08:23.034 --> 08:26.036
This is the first food
I've been able to feed myself

08:26.037 --> 08:27.905
since I was nine.

08:28.907 --> 08:30.041
<i>T.J., this is Young.</i>

08:30.042 --> 08:32.409
<i>Have you seen Rush?</i>

08:32.410 --> 08:34.746
<i>He turned his damn radio off.</i>

08:34.746 --> 08:37.982
I think I've gotten
you in trouble.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.852
They're on their way now, sir.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.636
I took my vacation time.

08:55.637 --> 08:56.870
All of it?

08:56.871 --> 08:58.005
Yeah.

08:58.006 --> 09:00.841
We have a lot of lost time
to make up for.

09:00.842 --> 09:02.042
You got rid of
the ugly chair.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.458
You can do better than that.

09:27.103 --> 09:30.105
Five or six percent
would do it.

09:30.106 --> 09:31.473
That's the thought.

09:31.474 --> 09:32.741
The problem is

09:32.742 --> 09:34.177
how to do that
without any access

09:34.178 --> 09:36.746
to the ship's
core systems.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.014
Or for that matter,
any knowledge

09:38.015 --> 09:39.916
of how they work
in the first place.

09:39.917 --> 09:42.552
I'm just saying.

09:42.553 --> 09:45.523
Show her everything
you've got.

10:00.206 --> 10:01.940
Nicholas?

10:06.746 --> 10:07.879
It's me again.

10:09.449 --> 10:11.451
We came out of FTL.

10:11.452 --> 10:14.487
Something's happened
to the ship.

10:19.398 --> 10:20.298
Okay, listen up,

10:20.299 --> 10:22.333
I promise to get to everyone,

10:22.334 --> 10:23.369
but right now,

10:23.370 --> 10:25.637
I need anyone who has
a potential head injury

10:25.638 --> 10:26.605
or internal trauma

10:26.606 --> 10:28.106
to move to the
front of the line.

10:28.107 --> 10:29.875
Don't be shy.

10:29.876 --> 10:32.077
T.J.!

10:32.078 --> 10:34.279
Put us to work.

10:34.280 --> 10:38.284
Anyone who's shaky,
don't take any chances.

10:38.285 --> 10:39.452
The quiet ones could
be in the worst shape.

10:39.453 --> 10:40.787
What about you?

10:40.788 --> 10:43.923
I'm fine. Go.

10:45.225 --> 10:47.126
Are we under
attack or not?

10:47.127 --> 10:48.896
No.

10:48.897 --> 10:50.097
It was a malfunction.

10:50.098 --> 10:51.165
He's right,
there's no sign

10:51.166 --> 10:52.332
of any hostile
ships in range.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.767
Not that I can
tell, anyway.

10:53.768 --> 10:54.835
What happened, then?

10:54.936 --> 10:56.303
I think there was
an explosion

10:56.304 --> 10:57.471
In the FTL drive.

10:57.472 --> 10:58.773
We're adrift.

10:58.774 --> 10:59.574
Why?

10:59.675 --> 11:00.976
An overload?

11:01.077 --> 11:02.044
It could be anything.

11:02.145 --> 11:03.812
Can we access
the engineering spaces?

11:03.813 --> 11:05.346
Not without
a space suit.

11:05.347 --> 11:06.982
Most of the ship's
unpressurized.

11:06.983 --> 11:08.984
Best to check the damage
from outside the ship.

11:08.985 --> 11:10.686
I can fly a kino pretty well.

11:10.687 --> 11:12.220
Get to it.

11:12.221 --> 11:13.856
You two monitor from here.

11:13.857 --> 11:15.958
I'll use the stones
to report this.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.401
Mandy, are you sure
you're all right?

11:25.402 --> 11:26.870
For a second there,

11:26.871 --> 11:30.307
I was back on earth
in a strange house,

11:30.308 --> 11:31.908
Back in my own body again.

11:31.909 --> 11:35.946
The link is temporarily severed
when we go in and out of FTL.

11:35.947 --> 11:38.248
I'm sorry, we weren't expecting
that to happen.

11:38.249 --> 11:40.418
I'm fine.

11:42.020 --> 11:44.188
What do you remember?

11:44.189 --> 11:45.256
I was walking,

11:45.257 --> 11:46.624
Then I was somewhere else,

11:46.625 --> 11:48.993
And I don't know
how I got there.

11:48.994 --> 11:51.229
Then the explosion
happened.

11:51.230 --> 11:52.598
So the lapse happened before?

11:53.667 --> 11:56.201
Well, sometimes concussions
can cause short-term memory loss

11:56.202 --> 11:57.236
And confusion.

11:57.237 --> 11:58.270
We'll just
keep you here tonight,

11:58.271 --> 11:59.271
Make sure it's nothing
more serious.

11:59.272 --> 12:00.272
T.J.!

12:00.273 --> 12:01.540
He was on the floor.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.275
I couldn't tell
if he was hurt or not.

12:03.376 --> 12:05.278
Okay, put him
over here, guys.

12:15.356 --> 12:17.158
Franklin?

12:20.328 --> 12:21.896
<i>This is Volker.</i>

12:21.897 --> 12:23.898
<i>Are you getting pictures?</i>

12:23.899 --> 12:27.268
Yeah, we see it.

12:27.269 --> 12:32.574
So is there anything
I need to worry about?

12:32.575 --> 12:34.242
I've been with
Amanda a long time.

12:34.243 --> 12:35.977
We'll need to monitor
her blood pressure,

12:35.978 --> 12:37.012
And there's a few
other things

12:37.013 --> 12:38.079
I need to show you

12:38.080 --> 12:39.414
That just come
with the territory,

12:39.415 --> 12:41.516
And she'll be fine.

12:41.517 --> 12:45.454
I'm sorry, it's just
I'm new to all this.

12:45.455 --> 12:49.158
You'll be fine too.

13:01.973 --> 13:03.006
What's happening?

13:03.007 --> 13:04.942
Incoming wormhole.

13:04.943 --> 13:06.310
<i>This is Rush.</i>

13:06.311 --> 13:07.879
<i>We have an
incoming wormhole.</i>

13:07.880 --> 13:09.347
<i>Sgt. Greer, please meet
me in the gate room</i>

13:09.348 --> 13:11.683
<i>with a defense team.</i>

13:21.395 --> 13:23.063
I need everybody
out of here!

13:23.164 --> 13:25.664
That won't be
necessary, Sergeant.

13:33.407 --> 13:34.541
Whoa, whoa, don't shoot!

13:34.542 --> 13:35.408
Stand down!

13:35.409 --> 13:36.276
Told you.

13:38.246 --> 13:39.913
Oh, my brother.

13:39.914 --> 13:41.314
Greer!

13:41.315 --> 13:44.017
I didn't expect to
see you again either.

13:44.018 --> 13:46.454
What do you mean you
weren't expecting to see us?

13:46.455 --> 13:48.389
Didn't you guys figure out
a way for us to dial in?

13:59.135 --> 14:01.103
I joined a book club.

14:01.104 --> 14:03.405
Yeah, it's supposed
to be all women,

14:03.406 --> 14:05.407
But there are a few
enlightened young men

14:05.408 --> 14:06.541
Who stop by

14:06.542 --> 14:08.076
And claim to have
an interest

14:08.077 --> 14:09.946
In 19th century
chick-lit.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.285
Can we concentrate
on eating right now?

14:15.286 --> 14:16.319
Sorry.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.587
Sorry.

14:17.588 --> 14:20.290
You know what,
why don't I do that?

14:20.291 --> 14:24.261
Yeah, we'll
be fine.

14:24.262 --> 14:25.963
One at a time.

14:25.964 --> 14:27.398
Got it.

14:37.476 --> 14:41.313
This isn't, freaking
you out, is it?

14:41.314 --> 14:43.581
You're here.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.216
That's all that matters.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.722
Here.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.724
Well, we were pretty much
resigned to the fact

14:51.725 --> 14:53.559
that we were stuck out there.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.594
Talk about feeling
like a third wheel.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.431
And then
on the second night,

14:58.432 --> 15:00.132
the kino remote just lit up.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.368
I guess I just thought

15:01.369 --> 15:02.703
you guys must've
figured something out.

15:02.704 --> 15:04.738
We dialed back,

15:04.739 --> 15:06.707
and here we are.

15:06.708 --> 15:09.009
I didn't think it was possible
to miss this bucket.

15:09.010 --> 15:10.310
Do you people
realize

15:10.311 --> 15:12.079
you just scared
the crap out of us?

15:12.080 --> 15:13.481
Sorry, sir.

15:13.482 --> 15:14.615
You're forgiven.

15:14.616 --> 15:16.084
So, are they going to live?

15:16.085 --> 15:17.352
Looks like it.

15:17.353 --> 15:18.453
That planet couldn't have been
all that bad.

15:18.454 --> 15:20.288
That's good.

15:20.289 --> 15:22.623
Because if we don't get
the FTL drive fixed,

15:22.624 --> 15:23.725
That's where
we'll all be going.

15:23.726 --> 15:24.559
Really?

15:24.560 --> 15:25.395
Really, Eli.

15:25.396 --> 15:26.562
I'm sorry, but I'm going
to have to put you

15:26.563 --> 15:28.263
right back to work.

15:28.564 --> 15:30.000
Welcome back.

15:40.278 --> 15:43.213
How's he doing?

15:43.214 --> 15:44.614
Same,

15:44.615 --> 15:47.517
but something changed
since we got stuck.

15:47.518 --> 15:49.719
Doesn't he look
different to you?

15:49.720 --> 15:51.856
Maybe.

15:51.857 --> 15:53.224
It's like
he's in there,

15:53.225 --> 15:54.492
and he knows exactly
what's going on,

15:54.493 --> 15:55.593
but his brain
and his body

15:55.594 --> 15:57.228
just aren't
connected anymore.

15:57.229 --> 15:59.430
I don't know.

15:59.431 --> 16:00.965
I talked to Rush,

16:00.966 --> 16:03.602
and he says I'm probably
just imagining it.

16:04.904 --> 16:06.204
Maybe I am.

16:06.205 --> 16:09.741
I mean, I haven't slept
in I don't even know...

16:09.742 --> 16:11.309
Why?

16:11.310 --> 16:13.778
I keep having
the same bad dream.

16:13.779 --> 16:16.916
I am stuck in a dark room,

16:16.917 --> 16:21.220
But I'm not me,
and I can't get out.

16:21.221 --> 16:22.755
Are you claustrophobic?

16:22.756 --> 16:25.892
Little bit.

16:25.893 --> 16:26.959
Maybe it's some weird
phantom memory

16:26.960 --> 16:28.662
From your switch with Dr. Perry.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.535
Hey, math boy,

16:34.536 --> 16:37.237
Got those calculations
I was asking about?

16:39.774 --> 16:41.509
Done.

16:41.510 --> 16:44.746
And plea don't call me that.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.516
I know what that's like.

16:48.117 --> 16:50.518
Nick called me
"little miss brilliant"

16:50.619 --> 16:52.554
A couple of times, and it stuck.

16:53.355 --> 16:54.623
Nick?

16:54.624 --> 16:56.625
Nicholas.

16:57.026 --> 16:58.094
Rush?

16:58.195 --> 17:00.930
We were colleagues back at SGC

17:00.931 --> 17:02.831
a couple of years
before Icarus.

17:02.832 --> 17:04.767
He used to like to
bounce ideas off of me

17:04.768 --> 17:07.237
when he was working
on that ancient proof

17:07.238 --> 17:08.637
that you ended up solving.

17:08.638 --> 17:09.906
Congratulations,
by the way.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.444
Look where it got me.

17:14.945 --> 17:16.946
I would do anything
to be here.

17:18.151 --> 17:21.420
Anyway, after Nick's
wife passed away,

17:21.421 --> 17:24.522
we used to have
these long talks

17:25.523 --> 17:28.626
about his work
and my work,

17:28.627 --> 17:29.927
the ancients,

17:29.928 --> 17:31.430
ascension.

17:31.531 --> 17:33.532
It was like he didn't even
see the chair.

17:33.533 --> 17:34.933
I tried calling him

17:34.934 --> 17:36.768
"Mr. Brilliant" a few times,

17:36.769 --> 17:39.404
but I don't think
he ever got the hint.

17:39.405 --> 17:42.841
You had a thing? For him?

17:42.842 --> 17:45.311
What's wrong with that?

17:46.847 --> 17:48.782
I just find it
kind of surprising.

17:48.783 --> 17:52.052
Why, because a disabled person
can't have feelings for someone?

17:52.153 --> 17:55.289
I meant because you were...
You were talking about him.

17:55.790 --> 17:57.759
Yeah...

17:58.260 --> 17:59.426
Thanks for this.

18:00.929 --> 18:03.564
Sure...

18:03.565 --> 18:06.000
Rush?

18:13.976 --> 18:15.478
You've got something?

18:15.779 --> 18:18.013
Dr. Perry's concluded
that the explosion

18:18.014 --> 18:19.347
May be
to our advantage.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.348
How?

18:20.349 --> 18:22.685
There was an overload.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.520
One that probably
shouldn't have happened

18:24.521 --> 18:26.622
Because the system is
unbelievably robust

18:26.623 --> 18:27.990
With more safeguards
than I can count,

18:27.991 --> 18:29.859
But it happened,

18:29.860 --> 18:31.694
And as with
most overloads,

18:31.695 --> 18:33.629
It happened in the weakest link.

18:33.630 --> 18:34.698
The FTL drive
is made up of

18:34.699 --> 18:35.999
16 separate modules.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.368
The one that blew up
was the weakest link

18:38.369 --> 18:39.870
Because it was
the least efficient.

18:39.871 --> 18:41.672
So the ship can fly
on the other drives?

18:41.673 --> 18:43.540
Even better
than that.

18:43.541 --> 18:45.342
Without
the worn-out drive

18:45.343 --> 18:46.878
Bringing down
overall efficiency,

18:46.879 --> 18:50.315
Destiny should be able
to make it across the void.

18:50.316 --> 18:51.516
That's great work.

18:51.517 --> 18:53.918
I wouldn't pat anyone
on the back just yet.

18:53.919 --> 18:55.754
We still need to isolate
and bypass the damage.

18:55.755 --> 18:57.755
And with no access
to the core systems,

18:57.756 --> 18:58.790
It has to be done manually.

18:58.791 --> 18:59.925
Or...

18:59.926 --> 19:01.593
Or what?

19:01.594 --> 19:04.296
The robot we found.

19:04.297 --> 19:05.597
We think it might be able
to do some,

19:05.598 --> 19:07.400
Or maybe all of the repairs.

19:07.401 --> 19:09.902
I've already programmed
rudimentary instructions

19:09.903 --> 19:11.938
To begin the repairs.

19:13.208 --> 19:14.974
Scott, this is Young.

19:14.975 --> 19:16.043
Eli and Dr. Perry
have a shuttle mission

19:16.044 --> 19:16.877
To brief you on.

19:16.978 --> 19:19.913
<i>Copy that, sir,
I'm on my way.</i>

19:22.050 --> 19:23.485
What are the odds?

19:23.886 --> 19:25.886
That this is
going to work?

19:25.887 --> 19:27.922
Fair to middling.

19:27.923 --> 19:29.824
Time's an issue.

19:31.293 --> 19:33.194
There is
another option.

19:33.195 --> 19:36.097
Right, the chair.

19:36.398 --> 19:38.801
Well, if we can gain access
to the core systems,

19:38.802 --> 19:40.536
We can bypass
that damaged section

19:40.537 --> 19:41.770
In a single
command.

19:41.771 --> 19:42.838
Tell you what,

19:42.839 --> 19:43.939
If it comes
right down to it,

19:43.940 --> 19:45.640
I'll sit in the thing myself.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.701
<i>Getting into position now.</i>

20:22.548 --> 20:24.883
<i>Opening rear hatch.</i>

20:27.454 --> 20:29.622
<i>Okay, we're good.</i>

20:29.623 --> 20:32.425
Here we go.

20:41.068 --> 20:42.669
Come in.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.604
Oh, hi.

20:43.905 --> 20:44.938
Hi.

20:45.641 --> 20:47.741
I'd like permission
to join the team

20:47.742 --> 20:49.209
Going through the stargate
to the planet.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.211
Scott's going.

20:51.212 --> 20:53.849
He's a little busy
flying the shuttle right now.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.883
He's already on his way back.

20:58.154 --> 21:00.421
So is this
how it's going to be?

21:00.422 --> 21:02.123
Maybe I'd like to
see the planet

21:02.124 --> 21:03.625
Where I might have to raise
our child.

21:03.726 --> 21:07.163
You mean, if the ship
isn't fixed by then?

21:07.264 --> 21:10.134
Yeah, maternal
instincts, I guess.

21:11.635 --> 21:13.102
Okay.

21:13.603 --> 21:15.571
Permission granted.

21:15.572 --> 21:17.539
Thanks.

21:17.540 --> 21:18.875
T.J...

21:18.876 --> 21:20.510
I'll be careful.

21:22.046 --> 21:25.582
Lt. Scott found fresh water
due east of the stargate.

21:25.583 --> 21:26.583
That'll be your first stop.

21:26.584 --> 21:27.617
We should check out

21:27.618 --> 21:29.653
As much land
as possible

21:29.654 --> 21:30.821
In case we end up
having to live there.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.793
Send it.

21:39.765 --> 21:41.632
You know, we just
came from there.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.435
This is a waste of time.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.370
It's standard procedure, Eli.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.838
If you ask me,

21:46.839 --> 21:49.174
Sometimes you military people
are a little too...

21:49.175 --> 21:51.710
Holy crap!

21:51.711 --> 21:53.512
Did you see that?

21:53.513 --> 21:54.646
I saw.
Shut it down.

21:57.718 --> 22:00.787
Looks like
they found your camp.

22:00.788 --> 22:02.622
Can they get through
the stargate?

22:02.623 --> 22:03.523
Not without a remote.

22:03.524 --> 22:04.791
Lucky we weren't
still there,

22:04.792 --> 22:06.226
or else they'd have one.

22:06.227 --> 22:08.529
Either way, we're cut off.

22:08.530 --> 22:10.431
We have to fix the ship.

22:11.432 --> 22:15.132
<i>Three weeks later</i>

24:13.027 --> 24:15.396
You know, I could just
go to the corner store.

24:15.397 --> 24:17.465
We need a decent
grocery shopping.

24:17.466 --> 24:20.168
We're almost out of everything.

24:21.437 --> 24:22.470
Okay.

24:22.471 --> 24:23.838
I shouldn't be long.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.640
I'll be right back.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.280
I could've gone.

24:31.281 --> 24:34.149
I want her
to get out of the house.

24:35.552 --> 24:37.953
Even if it's just for an hour.

24:47.131 --> 24:49.399
Well, that's it.
You've done it.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.001
That isolates the drive.

24:51.002 --> 24:53.304
Well, that was
the easy part.

24:53.305 --> 24:56.007
We'll start on the bypass
in the morning, eh?

24:56.008 --> 24:57.141
You guys don't
do much for fun

24:57.142 --> 24:58.609
Around here,
do you?

24:58.610 --> 25:03.381
Well, there is
Mr. Brody's still.

25:03.382 --> 25:04.583
You have a still?

25:04.584 --> 25:05.584
Come and see.

25:07.654 --> 25:11.390
So I'm in a room,
but I'm not me.

25:11.391 --> 25:12.891
What do you see?

25:12.892 --> 25:14.426
Nothing.
Blackness,

25:14.427 --> 25:16.996
But I know that I am not alone.

25:16.997 --> 25:19.298
What if it isn't a dream?

25:19.299 --> 25:21.567
Thank you, Mr. Brody.

25:21.568 --> 25:22.635
Cheers.

25:22.636 --> 25:24.037
Now, be careful.

25:24.038 --> 25:27.273
This stuff has only one
redeeming quality.

25:39.487 --> 25:42.022
We make do with
what we have, right?

25:42.023 --> 25:43.458
Yeah.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.660
Speaking of,

25:45.661 --> 25:47.395
how are you managing

25:47.396 --> 25:48.563
Without your coffee?

25:49.965 --> 25:51.666
Well, I must admit,

25:51.667 --> 25:54.102
That's been one of
the most difficult things

25:54.103 --> 25:55.604
About being stuck up here.

25:55.605 --> 25:57.540
Oh, well, the hardships.

25:57.541 --> 25:59.075
I think "insanity"
is the proper word.

25:59.076 --> 26:01.310
There and back again.

26:01.311 --> 26:02.945
I've even had dreams
about the stuff.

26:02.946 --> 26:04.680
Well, for years
after my accident,

26:04.681 --> 26:06.682
I had dreams that I could walk.

26:08.152 --> 26:10.387
Yeah, no, I remember you
telling me that.

26:10.388 --> 26:14.224
And then I get to do this,
and it's...

26:14.225 --> 26:16.393
It's all happening.

26:16.394 --> 26:20.098
God, it's like a
dream come true.

26:20.099 --> 26:21.199
Yeah.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.168
But we have to fix your ship.

26:24.169 --> 26:25.704
We do.

26:25.705 --> 26:27.672
And then I'll have to wake up.

26:35.682 --> 26:37.983
Sir?

26:37.984 --> 26:38.984
Yeah?

26:39.485 --> 26:41.019
I think...

26:43.689 --> 26:47.560
I think I was the one
who damaged the ship.

26:47.561 --> 26:50.430
I'm starting to notice
that redeeming quality

26:50.431 --> 26:52.132
you were talking about.

26:52.133 --> 26:53.233
You'll have to
ask yourself

26:53.234 --> 26:54.434
if it was worth it
in the morning.

26:55.469 --> 26:57.738
Can I ask you
something?

26:57.739 --> 27:00.107
Sure.

27:00.108 --> 27:02.743
After your wife
passed away,

27:02.744 --> 27:06.480
and we'd have
those long talks,

27:06.481 --> 27:12.120
did you have any clue
how I felt about you?

27:12.121 --> 27:14.523
I thought
you felt sorry for me.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.326
I guess I thought the
same about you at first.

27:18.327 --> 27:20.529
I thought you were
absolutely brilliant.

27:20.530 --> 27:21.730
Remember
I used to call you

27:21.731 --> 27:23.432
Little miss brilliant...

27:23.433 --> 27:26.335
Yeah, just forget about that.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.205
I could never
be sorry about that.

27:31.241 --> 27:33.509
Good night.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.612
Nick...

27:35.613 --> 27:37.314
Yeah?

27:39.517 --> 27:41.618
Would you like to come in?

27:46.723 --> 27:47.791
Yeah.

28:30.372 --> 28:31.772
Look, I'm sorry,
darling, I'm sorry.

28:31.773 --> 28:33.140
I can't do this.

28:33.141 --> 28:34.308
Why?

28:34.309 --> 28:35.476
I just,
I can't do this.

28:37.246 --> 28:38.246
Nick...

28:38.247 --> 28:39.781
It's me.

28:39.782 --> 28:42.117
I think we both know

28:42.118 --> 28:44.186
It's a bit more complicated
than that.

28:44.187 --> 28:45.687
The word is "insane."

28:45.688 --> 28:47.589
Yeah.

28:47.590 --> 28:48.857
But this is also

28:48.858 --> 28:51.728
A once in a lifetime
chance for me.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.701
Mandy...

28:58.702 --> 29:00.904
You know,

29:00.905 --> 29:04.341
Probably better than anyone,

29:04.342 --> 29:06.911
How I was
when Gloria passed away.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.315
I recently
experienced

29:11.316 --> 29:15.586
Something that made me
go through it all again.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.355
More than a dream.

29:18.356 --> 29:22.394
As real as this is
to you now,

29:22.395 --> 29:26.765
And I can tell myself
that it's been years

29:26.766 --> 29:29.235
All I like.

29:31.305 --> 29:33.339
But in my heart

29:33.340 --> 29:37.510
It's just happened again.

29:57.299 --> 29:58.933
Well, at least
this time...

30:00.970 --> 30:02.971
I can do this.

30:19.223 --> 30:20.957
Oh, sorry, I...

30:20.958 --> 30:23.360
What is it?

30:23.361 --> 30:25.228
The Colonel needs to see
you in the interface room

30:25.229 --> 30:26.363
right away.

30:26.364 --> 30:27.497
Both of you.

30:27.498 --> 30:28.732
Is everything all right?

30:28.733 --> 30:31.001
No, it's about
to hit the fan again.

30:32.571 --> 30:34.672
Let's go.

30:46.619 --> 30:47.953
You were gone for hours!

30:47.954 --> 30:49.454
I know, I'm sorry.

30:49.455 --> 30:51.423
I locked my keys
in the car...

30:51.424 --> 30:53.792
I thought you had gotten
into an accident.

30:53.793 --> 30:55.827
I imagined you
being taken away

30:55.828 --> 30:56.963
By an ambulance!

30:56.964 --> 30:58.831
No. No, no, no, no.

30:58.832 --> 31:00.933
Oh, God, Camile, I'm sorry!

31:00.934 --> 31:02.435
My imagination just went...

31:02.436 --> 31:03.603
Hey, hey, hey...

31:05.039 --> 31:06.739
I know what it's like

31:06.740 --> 31:09.443
To wait for someone you love
to come home.

31:09.444 --> 31:12.679
I'm here now.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.348
I know.

31:14.349 --> 31:15.582
I know...

31:15.583 --> 31:16.583
Okay.

31:19.454 --> 31:20.487
Mary?

31:20.488 --> 31:22.156
Mary! Mary!

31:22.157 --> 31:23.757
I don't know
what's happening.

31:23.993 --> 31:26.494
I'm just going to
elevate her legs

31:26.495 --> 31:28.396
Above her heart
to stabilize.

31:28.397 --> 31:30.932
You're doing fine,
just try and stay calm.

31:30.933 --> 31:32.333
We were just talking,
and then she...

31:32.334 --> 31:33.835
I don't know.

31:33.836 --> 31:35.237
What's going on?

31:35.238 --> 31:37.440
She's going to be okay.

31:39.443 --> 31:41.677
Lieutenant James
left the comm room

31:41.678 --> 31:44.914
Without wiping her imprint
off of the stone.

31:44.915 --> 31:47.284
It got knocked onto the table,
and nobody noticed.

31:47.285 --> 31:49.386
We think that
in that opportunity,

31:49.387 --> 31:50.754
An alien might have
taken advantage,

31:50.755 --> 31:53.590
Used the stones, and
sabotaged our FTL drive.

31:53.591 --> 31:55.258
She told me
she blacked out

31:55.259 --> 31:56.860
Around the time
of the explosion.

31:56.861 --> 31:59.496
I thought it was
post-concussion syndrome.

31:59.497 --> 32:02.800
Well, mystery
solved.

32:02.801 --> 32:04.802
I don't see how
it changes anything.

32:04.803 --> 32:06.971
What part don't you get?

32:06.972 --> 32:08.339
They know we're out here.

32:08.340 --> 32:09.740
Yeah, they already did.

32:09.741 --> 32:11.309
Without
a tracking device,

32:11.310 --> 32:14.012
There's no way of them knowing
where we've dropped out of FTL.

32:14.013 --> 32:16.648
Yeah, he's right.

32:16.649 --> 32:18.550
The void is
unimaginably huge.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.152
They can't know
our location.

32:20.153 --> 32:22.588
Unless the alien who
took over James's body

32:22.989 --> 32:24.923
Managed to broadcast it.

32:25.924 --> 32:28.027
Like a subspace
message, you mean.

32:28.028 --> 32:29.896
Or the alien

32:29.897 --> 32:31.831
figured out our position
before the explosion

32:31.832 --> 32:33.700
and took it back with them.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.869
How would it know how...

32:35.870 --> 32:36.970
They sabotaged
the ship.

32:36.971 --> 32:38.772
How did they know
how to do that?

32:38.773 --> 32:41.775
He's right.

32:42.776 --> 32:44.011
That's it, then.

32:45.847 --> 32:47.247
They're coming.

32:48.355 --> 32:50.123
I'm so sorry.

32:50.124 --> 32:51.991
Don't be silly.

32:51.992 --> 32:54.794
I brought this
on myself.

32:56.263 --> 32:59.132
Forgive the intrusion.

32:59.133 --> 33:01.234
Come on in.

33:02.369 --> 33:03.671
Colonel Young

33:03.672 --> 33:05.639
just used the
stones to report.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.740
There's a strong possibility

33:06.741 --> 33:07.908
that Dr. Perry may have
to return to her body

33:07.909 --> 33:09.043
In the next several hours.

33:09.044 --> 33:10.211
We think it's best
that she returns

33:10.212 --> 33:11.679
To an air force facility.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.847
We'll say our goodbyes.

33:12.848 --> 33:15.182
I'll wait outside.

33:40.812 --> 33:42.079
Let's go!

33:46.417 --> 33:47.818
This is Young.

33:47.819 --> 33:49.319
<i>While repairs to the ship</i>

33:49.320 --> 33:51.288
<i>are still days
from being complete,</i>

33:51.289 --> 33:53.591
<i>despite our best efforts,</i>

33:53.592 --> 33:56.594
<i>we believe an attack
will happen at any moment.</i>

33:56.595 --> 34:01.132
<i>Shields will not withstand
a sustained bombardment.</i>

34:01.133 --> 34:05.069
<i>This time, we will not
be able to jump to FTL.</i>

34:05.070 --> 34:08.873
<i>Neither can we escape
through the stargate.</i>

34:08.875 --> 34:12.812
<i>Lt. Scott will be in charge
of our ship's defenses.</i>

34:12.813 --> 34:16.348
<i>Follow his orders
as you would mine.</i>

34:16.349 --> 34:21.987
<i>If boarded, Sgt. Greer will
coordinate the strike teams,</i>

34:21.989 --> 34:28.061
<i>but everyone will have
to join in our defense.</i>

34:28.062 --> 34:31.831
We'll give them a good fight.

34:39.308 --> 34:42.443
When the time comes,
don't wait too long.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.420
It'll be okay.

34:55.190 --> 34:57.460
I want you there

34:57.461 --> 34:59.596
To talk me
through it.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.868
This is all my fault.

35:05.869 --> 35:07.870
I panicked.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.582
The chair...

35:25.992 --> 35:27.726
<i>They're here, sir.</i>

35:27.727 --> 35:29.594
Tell me what to do.

35:29.595 --> 35:30.962
We've managed
to isolate

35:30.963 --> 35:33.031
The damaged module
from the rest.

35:33.032 --> 35:34.300
You have to command
the ship to enter FTL

35:34.301 --> 35:35.401
on the remaining drives...

35:35.402 --> 35:37.169
How the hell do I do that?

35:38.439 --> 35:40.673
Well, first you have
to sit in the chair.

35:43.945 --> 35:44.845
Wait!

35:45.146 --> 35:46.413
Dr. Franklin just spoke.

35:46.914 --> 35:48.448
Something about the chair.

35:48.449 --> 35:49.584
What about it?

35:50.085 --> 35:52.386
That's it, that's all he said,

35:52.387 --> 35:53.720
But I think he knows
what's going on,

35:53.721 --> 35:55.022
And I think he was trying to
say that it should be him.

35:55.023 --> 35:56.223
You can't possibly know that.

35:56.224 --> 35:57.758
Well, no, sir,
but I really think that...

35:58.728 --> 35:59.962
We're under attack.
I'm going to do this.

36:00.463 --> 36:01.530
No, wait a minute,
she might be right.

36:01.631 --> 36:03.598
I can't ask a man to
sacrifice his life, Rush.

36:03.699 --> 36:05.466
Franklin's already been
through the process.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.702
His brain will have had
time to heal...

36:06.803 --> 36:08.037
We don't have time for this!

36:08.138 --> 36:10.405
Which is exactly why
it should be him and not you.

36:10.406 --> 36:12.474
At least give him
the choice.

36:26.957 --> 36:28.324
Dr. Franklin...

36:32.163 --> 36:34.564
Dr. Franklin?

36:34.565 --> 36:37.101
This ship is
under attack.

36:37.102 --> 36:39.704
If someone doesn't go back
and sit in the chair

36:39.705 --> 36:41.338
And help the repairs,

36:41.339 --> 36:43.240
Then the ship's
going to be taken.

36:43.241 --> 36:47.645
We're all going to be taken.

36:57.457 --> 36:59.691
Do you understand

36:59.692 --> 37:02.562
What we are asking you to do?

37:15.043 --> 37:17.678
Concentrate your fire
on the smallest ships.

37:17.679 --> 37:20.080
They're going to try
and board us.

37:33.395 --> 37:34.529
Go back to your team.

37:34.530 --> 37:36.498
Yes, sir.

37:54.719 --> 37:57.254
The temperature's
dropping fast.

37:57.255 --> 37:58.722
Any idea why?

37:58.723 --> 38:00.657
I don't know.
This is something new.

38:06.165 --> 38:09.333
Go.

38:32.526 --> 38:34.194
Something's happening.

38:55.418 --> 38:57.252
Sergeant, keep an
eye on that door.

38:57.253 --> 38:59.254
Yes, sir.

39:02.258 --> 39:04.526
Dammit! Greer?

39:04.527 --> 39:07.462
<i>We're about to be boarded
right on top of your position.</i>

39:07.463 --> 39:09.398
Copy that.

39:13.770 --> 39:16.038
Colonel?
I thought you were...

39:16.039 --> 39:17.406
The FTL drive is powering up.

39:45.471 --> 39:47.306
Does this mean
you fixed the ship?

39:47.307 --> 39:49.241
Camile?

39:50.610 --> 39:52.478
No, it's me again.

39:54.814 --> 39:56.181
Don't you hate that?

39:56.984 --> 39:59.153
What's
our status?

39:59.154 --> 40:00.154
The damaged
section of the ship

40:00.655 --> 40:01.922
Has been bypassed.

40:01.923 --> 40:04.124
The FTL drive has
increased efficicy.

40:04.125 --> 40:05.692
It's a bit early to say,

40:05.693 --> 40:07.360
but it looks like we're
going to make it across.

40:17.138 --> 40:19.340
We did it.

40:19.341 --> 40:21.776
Yes, we did,

40:21.777 --> 40:24.613
and now it's time to go.

40:43.067 --> 40:45.168
It's not a very
nice thing to say,

40:45.169 --> 40:48.639
but I do hope you
need my help again.

40:48.640 --> 40:52.109
Well, I'm not above
arranging that, you know.

41:22.709 --> 41:24.810
Bye, Mandy.

41:25.812 --> 41:27.848
Bye, Nick.

41:37.692 --> 41:38.860
Nicholas?

41:38.861 --> 41:42.597
Welcome back, Camile.

41:52.642 --> 41:54.176
Anything happen?

41:54.177 --> 41:55.277
You'd know better
than I would, sir.

41:55.278 --> 41:56.512
I was watching
a closed door.

41:56.513 --> 41:57.679
Did it stay closed?

41:57.680 --> 41:58.781
Yes, sir.
