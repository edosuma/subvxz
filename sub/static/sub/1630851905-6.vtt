13:55.376 --> 13:58.128
<i>Hey. Where have you been?</i>

13:58.170 --> 14:01.882
<i>Had to pee.
What are you doing up?</i>

14:01.924 --> 14:03.551
<i>Bad dream.</i>

14:03.592 --> 14:06.971
<i>What was it this time?
A cheeseburger-baby?</i>

14:07.012 --> 14:09.807
I never should have
told you about that.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.480
<i>What am I gonna do, Tai?</i>

14:22.736 --> 14:24.697
<i>I heard
Katie Lindstrom did it</i>

14:24.738 --> 14:27.366
<i>with the underwire
of her bra last year.</i>

14:27.408 --> 14:30.828
<i>Have you lost your mind?
You'll die.</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:32.872
<i>I'll probably die either way.</i>

14:32.913 --> 14:34.874
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere,</i>

14:34.915 --> 14:38.836
<i>and the ob-gyn on call
is Misty fucking Quigley.</i>

14:38.878 --> 14:41.463
<i>At least this way I won't die
having my best friend...</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:47.261
<i>What... were you about to say?</i>

14:49.430 --> 14:51.223
<i>Shauna?</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:55.561
<i>That at least
this way I won't die</i>

14:55.603 --> 14:58.772
<i>having my best friend's
boyfriend's baby.</i>

14:58.814 --> 15:01.191
<i>It's Jeff's?</i>

15:01.233 --> 15:03.861
<i>soft, tender music</i>

15:03.903 --> 15:06.488
<i>Whoa.</i>

15:06.530 --> 15:09.033
<i>Okay.</i>

15:09.074 --> 15:13.871
<i>I mean... Wow. Yeah.</i>

15:14.788 --> 15:18.542
<i>But still, Shauna,
it's not worth dying</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:21.462
<i>to keep Jackie from finding out.</i>

15:23.505 --> 15:26.717
<i>I have a plan, all right?</i>

15:26.759 --> 15:29.678
<i>To head south and find help.</i>

15:29.720 --> 15:33.057
<i>So just wait.</i>

15:33.098 --> 15:37.102
<i>Please. Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.</i>

15:49.239 --> 15:52.868
<i>Here we go.</i>

15:52.910 --> 15:56.288
<i>Ta-da.</i>

15:56.330 --> 15:59.124
<i>-Oh, wow.
<i>-Ah. Mmm.</i></i>

15:59.166 --> 16:01.126
<i>I know it's silly
to do this every year, but</i>

16:01.168 --> 16:02.586
<i>it's not a real birthday</i>

16:02.628 --> 16:05.047
<i>-without presents.
- Oh.</i>

16:05.089 --> 16:07.132
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:12.972 --> 16:16.475
<i>Oh.</i>

16:16.517 --> 16:18.852
<i>-Oh. Yup.
- Yeah.</i>

16:18.894 --> 16:20.729
<i>It's...
She's got little babies.</i>

16:20.771 --> 16:22.272
<i>That is nice.
That's very pretty.</i>

16:22.314 --> 16:24.149
<i>It's-it's lovely.</i>

16:24.191 --> 16:25.985
<i>Jackie just adored rabbits.</i>

16:26.026 --> 16:28.362
<i>Dig in before it gets cold.</i>

16:28.404 --> 16:31.115
<i>-Great.
- Deal.</i>

16:31.699 --> 16:35.494
<i>You two have an anniversary
coming up, don't you?</i>

16:35.536 --> 16:38.163
<i>Yup. Yeah, pretty soon.</i>

16:38.205 --> 16:40.457
<i>Jackie would've been
so happy for you.</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:43.335
<i>I truly believe that.
She was generous that way.</i>

16:43.377 --> 16:46.505
<i>And she always worried about you
finding someone, Shauna.</i>

16:46.547 --> 16:49.508
<i>Silver linings, I suppose.</i>

16:49.550 --> 16:52.678
<i>-You two are a-a better match.</i>

16:52.720 --> 16:54.847
<i>You're both the type
to be content.</i>

16:54.888 --> 16:57.433
<i>You don't want more than,
well,</i>

16:57.474 --> 16:59.435
<i>-what you have.
- Um--</i>

16:59.476 --> 17:02.271
<i>Oh, I don't mean that
in a bad way.</i>

17:02.312 --> 17:07.192
<i>No, I mean... it's nonsense, all
this talk about having it all.</i>

17:07.234 --> 17:11.947
<i>The fact is, you just can't be
remarkable and raise a family.</i>

17:11.989 --> 17:16.952
<i>And you're the mother
of such a special little child.</i>

17:16.994 --> 17:18.746
<i>I don't even like my daughter.</i>

17:21.915 --> 17:23.709
<i>-I don't.
- She's...</i>

17:23.751 --> 17:26.420
<i>It's an inside joke.
She's kidding.</i>

17:26.462 --> 17:30.674
<i>Oh.</i>

17:30.716 --> 17:32.051
<i>How is Callie?</i>

17:32.092 --> 17:33.343
<i>-Um...</i>

17:33.385 --> 17:35.512
<i>Well, she's 16 going on 30.</i>

17:35.554 --> 17:37.848
<i>She reminds me so much
of Jackie at that age.</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:39.391
<i>-Yeah.
Mm.</i>

17:39.433 --> 17:41.643
<i>Callie's got college
coming up, doesn't she?</i>

17:41.685 --> 17:43.562
<i>It's so expensive now.</i>

17:43.604 --> 17:47.566
<i>Jeff works hard, but he's
the only one that contributes.</i>

17:47.608 --> 17:51.195
<i>Uh, financially, I mean.
Providing for</i>

17:51.236 --> 17:54.573
<i>Callie's education must
keep you both up at night.</i>

17:59.703 --> 18:02.372
<i>But we'd be happy to help.
It would be--</i>

18:02.414 --> 18:03.749
<i>No.</i>

18:07.211 --> 18:09.880
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Taylor,</i>

18:09.922 --> 18:13.467
<i>but, um, that's not necessary.</i>

18:13.509 --> 18:16.220
<i>Jeff and I have it covered.</i>

18:18.722 --> 18:21.225
<i>Just let us know
if you change your mind.</i>

18:21.266 --> 18:23.393
<i>Sure.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

18:24.603 --> 18:26.605
<i>If you'll excuse me,
I, uh, have to go</i>

18:26.647 --> 18:28.982
<i>-to the little girls' room.
- Sure.</i>

18:34.571 --> 18:38.117
<i>I never thought I'd be desperate
enough to want to eat a rabbit.</i>

18:38.158 --> 18:39.660
<i>Oh, well...</i>

18:39.701 --> 18:41.912
<i>I mean, what even is a rabbit?</i>

18:41.954 --> 18:44.498
<i>A squirrel with floppy ears
and a pom-pom on its ass?</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:45.958
<i>Like, why? What even is that?</i>

18:45.999 --> 18:49.628
<i>It's a rabbit.
What is this question?</i>

18:51.797 --> 18:54.466
<i>I'd sell my firstborn
for a cheesesteak right now.</i>

18:54.508 --> 18:57.469
<i>Maybe stop talking about food?</i>

18:57.511 --> 18:59.596
<i>I think I miss cheesesteaks
more than I miss Jeff.</i>

18:59.638 --> 19:01.890
<i>-That even possible?</i>

19:03.934 --> 19:06.103
<i>No, I miss Jeff more.</i>

19:06.145 --> 19:08.730
<i>Fuck. I miss his smell and...</i>

19:08.772 --> 19:11.733
<i>the way he'd rub my wrist
with his thumb</i>

19:11.775 --> 19:14.903
<i>when we were holding hands,
and...</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:18.282
<i>I even miss his stupid
Ace Ventura impressions.</i>

19:19.908 --> 19:22.828
<i>He must be losing
his mind right now.</i>

19:25.330 --> 19:28.041
<i>Did I tell you he said he
loved me the day before we left?</i>

19:31.211 --> 19:33.422
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

19:33.463 --> 19:37.176
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I-I didn't
say it back, and...</i>

19:37.217 --> 19:39.428
<i>I should have.</i>

19:42.681 --> 19:45.017
<i>I'm sure he knows how you feel.</i>

19:47.227 --> 19:50.314
<i>Wait. Do you... love him?</i>

19:51.982 --> 19:53.692
<i>I just thought that--</i>

19:53.734 --> 19:56.028
<i>I don't know. I...</i>

19:57.571 --> 20:00.866
<i>I just... shouldn't have
made him wait is all.</i>

20:00.908 --> 20:02.367
<i>soft, dramatic music</i>

20:02.409 --> 20:04.328
<i>I just got so caught up</i>

20:04.369 --> 20:06.538
<i>in making everything perfect,
and now, if we die out here,</i>

20:06.580 --> 20:09.958
<i>someone else is gonna be
his first, and I'm--</i>

20:10.000 --> 20:12.669
<i>Whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
You okay?</i>

20:12.711 --> 20:16.006
<i>Yeah, I'm just hungry.</i>

20:16.048 --> 20:18.550
<i>Oh. Here.</i>

20:18.592 --> 20:22.554
<i>-Take this.
- It's your last piece. I...</i>

20:22.596 --> 20:25.724
<i>You need it more than me. Here.</i>

20:25.766 --> 20:27.935
<i>Just take it.</i>

20:28.977 --> 20:31.355
<i>Thank you.</i>

20:31.396 --> 20:33.440
<i>Come on.</i>

20:49.122 --> 20:51.625
<i>-Oh. Sorry.
- It's cool.</i>

20:51.667 --> 20:56.129
<i>Maybe just slow down
a little bit.</i>

21:08.725 --> 21:11.061
<i>Sorry, sorry. That just...</i>

21:11.103 --> 21:13.355
<i>It tickles.</i>

21:19.778 --> 21:21.947
<i>Mm.</i>

21:21.989 --> 21:24.074
<i>-Uh.</i>

21:24.116 --> 21:25.617
<i>Ow.</i>

21:25.659 --> 21:27.619
<i>-Mm.</i>

21:27.661 --> 21:31.123
<i>I'm obviously just gonna keep
screwing this up, so whatever.</i>

21:31.164 --> 21:32.833
<i>Maybe we should
just head back.</i>

21:32.874 --> 21:36.295
<i>Come on. Who hasn't rolled over
a broken tray table</i>

21:36.336 --> 21:39.172
<i>while making out
in a blood-stained death trap?</i>

21:45.679 --> 21:49.725
<i>You're a really good kisser,
you know?</i>

21:52.019 --> 21:54.646
<i>I don't want to go back yet.</i>

21:54.688 --> 21:56.940
<i>Do you?</i>

22:16.835 --> 22:18.170
<i>-Ooh.
- Oh, nice.</i>

22:18.211 --> 22:20.422
<i>-Ooh.</i>

22:20.464 --> 22:24.468
<i>Natalie and Travis
sittin' in a tree.</i>

22:24.509 --> 22:26.011
<i>K-I-S-S-I--</i>

22:26.053 --> 22:27.346
<i>I think they were doing
a bit more than kissing.</i>

22:27.387 --> 22:29.681
<i>Hey, Nat,
what exactly are you</i>

22:29.723 --> 22:31.641
<i>and Flex hunting for
out there, anyway?</i>

22:31.683 --> 22:33.352
<i>I hear it's beaver season!</i>

22:33.393 --> 22:35.979
<i>-Ah, sit and spin, assholes.</i>

22:36.021 --> 22:37.773
<i>Is this why
we don't have any food?</i>

22:37.814 --> 22:41.151
<i>'Cause you've been too busy
running for mayor of pound town?</i>

22:41.193 --> 22:43.153
<i>Uh, go fuck yourself?</i>

22:43.195 --> 22:46.031
<i>I guess
we shouldn't be surprised.</i>

22:46.073 --> 22:49.034
<i>Nat's always down
for a good time, right?</i>

22:49.076 --> 22:52.204
<i>I can't magically
conjure a deer, Jackie.</i>

22:52.245 --> 22:54.706
<i>But keep talking shit,
I'll find something to shoot.</i>

22:54.748 --> 22:57.334
<i>Oh, wow. Oh, you're so tough.</i>

22:57.376 --> 22:59.711
<i>I'm not scared of you, burnout.</i>

22:59.753 --> 23:01.421
<i>No. You're jealous.</i>

23:01.463 --> 23:03.173
<i>slow, eerie vocal music</i>

23:03.215 --> 23:06.051
<i>'Cause you're an uptight,
prudish little bitch.</i>

23:06.093 --> 23:07.761
<i>Hey! Knock it off.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:09.763
<i>Both of you.</i>

23:10.806 --> 23:12.891
<i>I know how you feel, Nat.</i>

23:12.933 --> 23:16.061
<i>I have a secret boyfriend, too.</i>

23:16.103 --> 23:18.230
<i>Shh.</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:24.152
<i>Yes, I understand
it's a joint account,</i>

23:24.194 --> 23:25.862
<i>but I shouldn't need
my wife's signature</i>

23:25.904 --> 23:28.698
<i>for a withdrawal of any size.</i>

23:28.740 --> 23:31.243
<i>Can I increase the cap?</i>

23:32.452 --> 23:34.454
<i>You know what?
Thanks for your help.</i>

23:37.249 --> 23:39.334
<i>Hey, Sam, why don't you
and Biscuit go play</i>

23:39.376 --> 23:40.669
<i>in your room for a little bit</i>

23:40.710 --> 23:42.587
<i>-while I talk to Mom?
- About what?</i>

23:42.629 --> 23:45.674
<i>What have I said about getting
into grown folks' business?</i>

23:47.467 --> 23:49.511
<i>Come on, Biscuit.
Let's go. Come on.</i>

23:51.471 --> 23:54.891
<i>Simone, I'm sorry.</i>

23:54.933 --> 23:57.102
<i>We're taking Sammy
to see a child psychologist.</i>

23:57.144 --> 23:58.979
<i>Today.</i>

23:59.020 --> 24:00.564
<i>I made the appointment.</i>

24:00.605 --> 24:02.524
<i>You need to be there by 3:00.</i>

24:02.566 --> 24:04.109
<i>How could you do that
without telling me?</i>

24:04.151 --> 24:05.652
<i>Are you for real right now?</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:07.362
<i>And where the hell
did you go last night?</i>

24:07.404 --> 24:09.781
<i>You promised we were gonna
have a conversation.</i>

24:09.823 --> 24:11.450
<i>This is not a request, Taissa.</i>

24:11.491 --> 24:12.742
<i>Look. I know you're upset.</i>

24:12.784 --> 24:14.828
<i>I am beyond upset.</i>

24:14.870 --> 24:16.705
<i>I don't even know who the hell
you are right now.</i>

24:16.746 --> 24:18.206
<i>The woman
I saw out there yesterday</i>

24:18.248 --> 24:19.958
<i>was not the woman
that I married.</i>

24:20.000 --> 24:22.794
<i>You lied straight
to my face, Taissa!</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:24.296
<i>When I started
that press conference,</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:25.630
<i>I was going to drop out.</i>

24:25.672 --> 24:27.883
<i>Looking at you, Sammy--</i>

24:27.924 --> 24:30.302
<i>I remembered
why I got into this.</i>

24:30.343 --> 24:32.888
<i>And this was not just my dream.</i>

24:32.929 --> 24:35.015
<i>This is our dream.</i>

24:40.520 --> 24:43.565
<i>Giving up on it felt like
giving up on us, and...</i>

24:43.607 --> 24:46.234
<i>soft, dramatic music</i>

24:49.279 --> 24:51.239
<i>Three o'clock.</i>

24:51.281 --> 24:54.284
<i>Our son needs help.</i>

24:54.326 --> 24:58.038
<i>And if this is really about us,
you will fucking be there.</i>

25:26.399 --> 25:28.360
<i>soft, melancholy music</i>

25:58.765 --> 26:00.892
<i>Okay, read it back to me.</i>

26:00.934 --> 26:02.435
<i>Okay.</i>

26:02.477 --> 26:05.355
<i>So I'll go,
"You're Jeff, right?"</i>

26:05.397 --> 26:09.276
<i>And then, he'll nod or whatever,
and then I'll say,</i>

26:09.317 --> 26:12.028
<i>"Your friend Randy told me
that you asked him</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:16.199
<i>to ask me to ask Jackie
if she likes you."</i>

26:16.241 --> 26:18.410
<i>Just don't say</i>

26:18.451 --> 26:21.037
<i>that I told you to ask him.</i>

26:21.079 --> 26:23.206
<i>I don't want him to think
that I've been, like,</i>

26:23.248 --> 26:26.710
<i>pining over him or whatever.</i>

26:26.751 --> 26:30.046
<i>What if he says yes?</i>

26:30.088 --> 26:32.841
<i>Then just be like, "Okay. Cool."</i>

26:32.882 --> 26:35.719
<i>Definitely don't act
like you know I like him back.</i>

26:35.760 --> 26:37.762
Wait.

26:37.804 --> 26:41.266
<i>Do you, like,</i> <i>like</i> <i>like him?</i>

26:41.308 --> 26:43.018
<i>Oh, my God.
Jackie, why didn't you tell me?</i>

26:51.151 --> 26:53.862
<i>jarring, dramatic music</i>

26:58.241 --> 27:00.285
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:03.788
<i>What happened.</i>

27:03.830 --> 27:06.541
<i>I know.</i>

27:06.583 --> 27:08.627
<i>Um, what?</i>

27:08.668 --> 27:11.212
<i>Actually, you don't know.</i>

27:11.254 --> 27:12.922
<i>It's totally your fault.</i>

27:12.964 --> 27:15.008
<i>eerie, vocal music</i>

27:15.050 --> 27:17.177
<i>But we were kids.</i>

27:19.554 --> 27:21.598
<i>And it was awful.</i>

27:21.640 --> 27:24.643
<i>Why are you here?</i>

27:24.684 --> 27:26.519
<i>Why are</i> <i>you</i> <i>here?</i>

27:28.897 --> 27:31.024
<i>Where you been?</i>

27:36.154 --> 27:38.823
<i>You left me all alone
down there.</i>

27:50.669 --> 27:52.337
<i>Hmm.</i>

27:52.379 --> 27:56.508
<i>Do you ever wish...</i>

27:57.509 --> 27:58.843
<i>Do you want to go?</i>

28:00.887 --> 28:02.806
<i>We can leave if you want.</i>

28:03.765 --> 28:06.142
<i>We just have to make it
through dessert.</i>

28:08.186 --> 28:10.063
<i>To Jackie,</i>

28:10.105 --> 28:12.107
<i>whose light shone too bright</i>

28:12.148 --> 28:14.859
<i>to ever be extinguished
from our memories.</i>

28:14.901 --> 28:16.861
<i>Happy Birthday, baby.</i>

28:16.903 --> 28:18.363
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

28:18.405 --> 28:19.489
<i>Cheers.</i>

28:19.531 --> 28:20.907
<i>To Jackie.</i>

28:20.949 --> 28:22.325
<i>We're reading</i>

28:22.367 --> 28:24.703
<i>Elena Ferrante in our book club,</i>

28:24.744 --> 28:27.539
<i>and it reminds me so much
of you girls.</i>

28:28.164 --> 28:30.959
<i>It can't always have been easy
for you, Shauna.</i>

28:31.000 --> 28:34.754
<i>Jackie was just so... gifted.</i>

28:34.796 --> 28:37.507
<i>I can't imagine how exhausting
it must've been,</i>

28:37.549 --> 28:40.885
<i>always comparing yourself
to someone so beautiful</i>

28:40.927 --> 28:42.512
<i>and smart.</i>

28:42.554 --> 28:44.681
<i>Shauna got into Brown.</i>

28:45.682 --> 28:47.559
<i>She's, uh,</i>

28:47.600 --> 28:50.228
<i>the smartest person
I've ever met.</i>

28:51.688 --> 28:53.064
<i>Are-are you a genius?</i>

28:53.106 --> 28:55.150
<i>Did you ever take one
of those tests?</i>

28:55.191 --> 28:56.568
<i>-I--
- You should take one of those.</i>

28:56.609 --> 28:58.403
<i>-I haven't.
- Shauna and I were sleeping</i>

28:58.445 --> 29:00.655
<i>together when Jackie and I
were still a couple.</i>

29:03.491 --> 29:06.202
<i>Which is, obviously,
you know, a shitty,</i>

29:06.244 --> 29:07.704
<i>uh, thing.</i>

29:07.746 --> 29:10.039
<i>But there it is.</i>

29:10.081 --> 29:13.418
<i>Because the truth is
Jackie was amazing.</i>

29:17.881 --> 29:19.883
<i>But so was my damn wife.</i>

29:19.924 --> 29:22.093
<i>And she still is.</i>

29:22.135 --> 29:26.389
<i>And I may have been
an idiot then,</i>

29:26.431 --> 29:29.392
<i>but at least I was
smart enough to see that.</i>

29:36.524 --> 29:39.444
<i>And this really is
the best tuna quiche</i>

29:39.486 --> 29:41.738
<i>I've ever tasted, Mrs. Taylor.</i>

29:45.617 --> 29:47.160
<i>The behavior you've described</i>

29:47.202 --> 29:48.745
<i>suggests any number of things.</i>

29:48.787 --> 29:51.706
<i>A psychogenic fugue,
dissociative amnesia.</i>

29:51.748 --> 29:53.833
<i>It'll take more sessions
to get a firm grasp</i>

29:53.875 --> 29:55.752
<i>-on what's going on.</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:57.962
<i>Oh.</i>

30:00.840 --> 30:02.467
<i>I'm sorry. Please continue.</i>

30:02.509 --> 30:05.094
<i>Ah, well,
that's-that's about it.</i>

30:05.136 --> 30:06.888
<i>We certainly need more sessions.</i>

30:11.017 --> 30:14.771
<i>So, any thoughts
on what Dr. Sandlow had to say,</i>

30:14.813 --> 30:17.232
<i>or were you too busy
checking your inbox?</i>

30:17.273 --> 30:18.942
<i>Oh. Wow.</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:21.569
<i>We just learned
our son doesn't remember any</i>

30:21.611 --> 30:23.154
<i>of the things we accused him of.</i>

30:23.196 --> 30:24.906
<i>He thinks
he's telling the truth.</i>

30:24.948 --> 30:27.116
<i>-According to the shrink.
- What, you don't believe her?</i>

30:27.158 --> 30:29.661
<i>Shrinks make their living off of
problems that don't get solved.</i>

30:29.702 --> 30:32.539
<i>You know, for someone who went
through some shit of their own,</i>

30:32.580 --> 30:35.375
<i>it never ceases to amaze me
how shut off you are to help.</i>

30:35.416 --> 30:38.127
<i>"Psychogenic this,
dissipated that."</i>

30:38.169 --> 30:40.171
<i>Okay, okay,
beyond all the jargon,</i>

30:40.213 --> 30:42.173
<i>did she actually have any fixes?</i>

30:42.215 --> 30:46.386
<i>She says his behavior stems
from overwhelming stress.</i>

30:46.427 --> 30:47.679
<i>For fuck's sake.</i>

30:47.720 --> 30:49.806
<i>Sammy is not okay, Tai.</i>

30:49.848 --> 30:51.850
<i>And I don't know how or why,</i>

30:51.891 --> 30:54.018
<i>but we're his moms,
and we have to do better.</i>

30:54.060 --> 30:56.020
<i>-Jesus, watch out!</i>

30:56.062 --> 30:59.148
<i></i>

30:59.190 --> 31:01.025
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

31:01.067 --> 31:03.403
<i>What the fuck?</i>

31:05.905 --> 31:09.033
<i>It's okay. We're okay.</i>

31:09.075 --> 31:11.786
<i>slow, eerie music</i>

31:28.887 --> 31:31.222
<i>Travis. Hey.</i>

31:31.264 --> 31:34.017
<i>Uh, you want
to grab a seat for a sec?</i>

31:34.058 --> 31:36.394
<i>Been wanting to talk to you.</i>

31:36.436 --> 31:39.230
<i>Okay.</i>

31:40.940 --> 31:42.901
<i>Okay.</i>

31:42.942 --> 31:47.030
<i>Uh, yeah, look, um,</i>

31:47.071 --> 31:49.073
<i>girls like to talk, right?</i>

31:49.115 --> 31:53.411
<i>So, I've, uh,
heard a few things.</i>

31:53.453 --> 31:55.538
<i>Yeah?</i>

31:55.580 --> 31:57.498
<i>Like what?</i>

31:59.584 --> 32:01.711
<i>All right, look, man,</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:05.423
<i>whatever is up between you
and Natalie is your business.</i>

32:05.465 --> 32:08.593
<i>Okay? But where it could become</i>

32:08.635 --> 32:12.597
<i>our business is if...</i>

32:12.639 --> 32:14.682
<i>you know.
Okay, fuck.</i>

32:14.724 --> 32:16.684
<i>Travis, the last fucking thing</i>

32:16.726 --> 32:18.937
<i>that we need out here right now
is a baby to take care of.</i>

32:18.978 --> 32:21.064
<i>Not to mention the risks
to Natalie.</i>

32:21.105 --> 32:24.776
<i>I... I got it covered, Coach.</i>

32:24.817 --> 32:27.904
<i>Do you? I mean, like, literally?</i>

32:27.946 --> 32:31.866
<i>'Cause the pull-out method--
it sucks.</i>

32:31.908 --> 32:34.369
<i>Only a 78% chance of success.</i>

32:34.410 --> 32:36.955
<i>I don't know. You tell me.
If 22% of your players</i>

32:36.996 --> 32:38.623
<i>couldn't make it onto the field,</i>

32:38.665 --> 32:39.958
<i>would you really want
to play that game?</i>

32:39.999 --> 32:43.294
<i>Uh, uh, I mean,</i>

32:43.336 --> 32:45.797
<i>I'll just make sure that I...</i>

32:45.838 --> 32:48.007
<i>Oh.</i>

32:51.302 --> 32:53.805
<i>Weren't we only gonna be
in Seattle for, like, a week?</i>

32:53.846 --> 32:55.807
<i>-Who-who are you?
- Yeah, you know what, Travis?</i>

32:55.848 --> 32:57.809
<i>That's really not your business.</i>

32:57.850 --> 32:59.519
<i>Mm, I think you just kind of
made it my business.</i>

32:59.560 --> 33:01.354
<i>Okay, Jesus Christ, man.
Just take them.</i>

33:01.396 --> 33:03.398
<i>All right?</i>

33:03.439 --> 33:08.111
<i>And please be sure to use them.</i>

33:14.283 --> 33:16.369
<i>-Oh, fuck me.</i>

33:21.958 --> 33:25.086
<i>Hey. You get the money?</i>

33:25.128 --> 33:26.504
<i>-I can't.
- Can't?</i>

33:26.546 --> 33:28.006
<i>You're supposed
to be the rich one.</i>

33:28.047 --> 33:29.340
<i>I'm going through</i>

33:29.382 --> 33:31.300
<i>some shit
with my family right now.</i>

33:31.342 --> 33:34.012
<i>My wife and I aren't really
in a place where I can ask her</i>

33:34.053 --> 33:36.139
<i>to co-sign a withdrawal
of 50 grand, so...</i>

33:36.180 --> 33:38.433
<i>Fine. I'll get it.</i>

33:38.474 --> 33:40.768
<i>How? You're gonna
sell your soul?</i>

33:40.810 --> 33:45.523
<i>Just be ready when
this fucker texts again, okay?</i>

33:45.565 --> 33:47.692
<i>slow, ominous music</i>

33:54.240 --> 33:56.242
<i>Oh. over here.</i>

33:56.284 --> 33:58.828
Come on!
I'm gonna try to catch it!

33:58.870 --> 34:01.581
<i>-Come on!
- Catch!</i>

34:01.622 --> 34:03.875
<i>-No. No.
- Oh, good one!</i>

34:09.547 --> 34:11.424
<i>Fragile things,
you should know by now...</i>

34:11.466 --> 34:14.093
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

34:14.135 --> 34:18.222
<i>Thought you might be hungry.</i>

34:18.264 --> 34:20.266
<i>I've got stuff to do.</i>

34:20.308 --> 34:21.851
<i>I got time.</i>

34:21.893 --> 34:23.895
<i>Follow me.</i>

34:23.936 --> 34:27.398
<i>You should know by now...</i>

34:27.440 --> 34:30.401
<i>Well, thank you very much.</i>

34:30.443 --> 34:32.403
<i>I'll take those from you.</i>

34:32.445 --> 34:34.530
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:34.572 --> 34:36.741
<i>Oh, man.</i>

34:42.872 --> 34:44.707
<i>When you said errands,</i>

34:44.749 --> 34:46.751
<i>I was thinking more like
the dry cleaners.</i>

34:46.793 --> 34:49.587
<i>-Why'd you sell it?</i>

34:49.629 --> 34:52.173
<i>I was a different person
back when I bought it.</i>

34:54.634 --> 34:55.968
<i>Now what?</i>

34:56.010 --> 34:58.096
<i>My ex just called.</i>

34:58.137 --> 35:00.431
<i>There's something
I've got to do.</i>

35:00.473 --> 35:03.601
<i>Um, I can totally
drop you off.</i>

35:03.643 --> 35:07.271
<i>Unless you, uh,
want to return the favor?</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:12.902
<i>You gonna drive fast?</i>

35:30.670 --> 35:32.630
<i>eerie vocalizing</i>

35:40.805 --> 35:42.807
<i>soft, suspenseful music</i>

35:45.852 --> 35:47.812
<i>eerie vocalizing</i>

36:03.035 --> 36:05.079
<i>eerie vocalizing</i>

36:21.971 --> 36:24.015
<i>Tai.</i>

36:35.276 --> 36:37.528
<i>I don't wish I'd married Jackie.</i>

36:43.534 --> 36:46.370
<i>I don't wish
things were different.</i>

36:47.038 --> 36:49.999
<i>I mean, it's not like
I've never thought about it,</i>

36:50.041 --> 36:54.212
<i>uh, but, no, I...</i>

36:54.253 --> 36:56.964
<i>We've made a life together,
Shauna.</i>

36:58.424 --> 37:01.719
<i>And, no, it's not...
it's not perfect.</i>

37:01.761 --> 37:05.765
<i>It's not what either of us
thought it was gonna be, but...</i>

37:05.806 --> 37:09.977
<i>-You think?
- It's...</i>

37:10.019 --> 37:14.065
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

37:14.106 --> 37:16.275
<i>None.
And I want you to know that.</i>

37:16.317 --> 37:18.736
<i>And how we started was not...</i>

37:18.778 --> 37:22.198
<i>Well, it wasn't
our finest moment or anything.</i>

37:23.241 --> 37:25.993
<i>For Christ's sake,
we were kids, Shauna.</i>

37:26.035 --> 37:28.079
<i>Yeah, but that
doesn't make it right.</i>

37:28.120 --> 37:30.206
<i>Yeah, well, come on.</i>

37:32.458 --> 37:35.253
<i>Jackie was gonna
break up with me anyway.</i>

37:36.754 --> 37:39.131
<i>I was the high school boyfriend.</i>

37:39.173 --> 37:41.133
<i>soft, dramatic music</i>

37:42.760 --> 37:46.305
That's all
I was ever gonna be.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.144
<i>But you and me-- we, uh...</i>

37:54.730 --> 37:58.276
<i>Well, we built...
We're still together.</i>

37:59.819 --> 38:02.780
<i>That's got to count
for something.</i>

38:03.864 --> 38:06.742
<i>I love you, Shauna.</i>

38:21.632 --> 38:23.801
<i></i>

38:25.219 --> 38:26.554
<i>All right, team, let's go!</i>

38:26.595 --> 38:28.848
<i></i>

38:30.474 --> 38:32.351
<i>Looking good out there, Mase.</i>

38:32.393 --> 38:33.936
<i>-Where's Mom?
- Uh,</i>

38:33.978 --> 38:35.980
<i>she got stuck at work, so...</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:37.481
<i>now you're stuck with me.</i>

38:39.483 --> 38:41.319
<i>This is my friend, Natalie.</i>

38:41.360 --> 38:43.612
<i>I've known her
since I was your age.</i>

38:43.654 --> 38:46.449
<i>-Hi.</i>

38:47.742 --> 38:49.994
<i>-Hey.
- When we were in high school</i>

38:50.036 --> 38:52.163
<i>together Natalie was on the team
that won the state championship.</i>

38:52.204 --> 38:53.914
<i>Whoa! You won states?</i>

38:53.956 --> 38:56.625
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

38:56.667 --> 38:59.003
<i>Did you go to nationals?</i>

38:59.045 --> 39:01.130
<i>We never actually made it.</i>

39:01.172 --> 39:02.673
<i>-Why? Did you get hurt?
Mase?</i>

39:02.715 --> 39:04.342
<i>Better head on out there.
Time-out's about to end.</i>

39:04.383 --> 39:06.886
<i>Hey, Mase?</i>

39:06.927 --> 39:09.305
<i>The other team's sweeper
is really weak</i>

39:09.347 --> 39:11.265
<i>on the right,
so run directly at him,</i>

39:11.307 --> 39:13.476
<i>feint left,
when he turns his hips,</i>

39:13.517 --> 39:14.935
<i>cut hard the other direction.</i>

39:14.977 --> 39:16.729
<i>Cool. Okay.</i>

39:16.771 --> 39:18.856
<i>Yeah!</i>

39:23.652 --> 39:26.530
<i></i>

39:30.326 --> 39:33.204
<i>Yes.</i>

39:34.246 --> 39:36.374
<i></i>

40:09.615 --> 40:12.201
<i>Lottie, have you seen Shauna?</i>

40:12.243 --> 40:13.411
<i>Uh...</i>

40:13.452 --> 40:14.870
<i>Lottie, have you?</i>

40:14.912 --> 40:17.540
<i>I think she went that way.
Wait! Um...</i>

40:17.581 --> 40:19.333
<i>Were you... uh...</i>

40:19.375 --> 40:21.210
<i>were you outside
last night eating dirt?</i>

40:21.252 --> 40:23.379
<i>-What the actual fuck? No.
- But--</i>

40:23.421 --> 40:25.464
<i>I can't do crazy
right now, Lot.</i>

40:33.806 --> 40:35.891
<i>Oh. Cheese and rice.</i>

40:35.933 --> 40:37.393
<i>You scared me.</i>

40:37.435 --> 40:39.812
<i>Sorry.</i>

40:39.854 --> 40:41.981
<i>Did you...</i>

40:43.107 --> 40:45.734
<i>...need something?</i>

40:45.776 --> 40:48.446
<i>I guess I wanted
to ask you something.</i>

40:49.989 --> 40:52.408
<i>I think it's about God.</i>

40:53.367 --> 40:55.911
<i>I think I'm seeing things.</i>

40:57.955 --> 41:00.291
<i>In the Bible,
people had visions, right?</i>

41:00.332 --> 41:02.251
<i>Like prophets and stuff?</i>

41:02.293 --> 41:05.963
<i>I was taught that visions were
God's way of communicating.</i>

41:06.005 --> 41:10.009
<i>They could either be a warning
or a revelation.</i>

41:16.682 --> 41:19.101
<i>But how did they know
they weren't just crazy?</i>

41:19.143 --> 41:21.312
<i>I think because
God gave them faith.</i>

41:21.353 --> 41:23.981
<i>It's the substance of things</i>

41:24.023 --> 41:26.150
<i>that are hoped for.</i>

41:26.192 --> 41:29.528
<i>And the evidence
of things unseen.</i>

41:32.198 --> 41:34.825
<i>They knew it
because they believed it.</i>

41:42.750 --> 41:44.460
