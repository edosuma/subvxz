05:19.208 --> 05:21.000

WHO WAS EXPOSED

05:26.417 --> 05:29.041

OH, I'M SORRY.
IT CONTAINS A LIVE VIRUS.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.500
IT'S NOT SAFE TO TAKE
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.

05:35.542 --> 05:38.041
BUT IF YOUR BLOOD COMES BACK
AND YOUR ANTIBODIES ARE LOW,

05:38.083 --> 05:40.959

WITH IMMUNOGLOBULIN.
AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.959
DOESN'T MEASLES
LEAD TO BIRTH DEFECTS?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.125

06:00.375 --> 06:02.041
WILL'S FINE.
SO FAR,

06:05.083 --> 06:08.041
IT'S THE MEASLES. I-I--WHEN
MY PARENTS WERE GROWING UP,

06:08.083 --> 06:11.041
EVERYONE GOT IT.
AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
DIED FROM IT EVERY YEAR.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.375
THE VACCINE CHANGED--

06:12.417 --> 06:14.208
DON'T EVEN THINK
OF SUGGESTING--

06:14.250 --> 06:17.375
THERE'S NO PROVEN LINK
BETWEEN VACCINATIONS AND AUTISM.

06:17.417 --> 06:21.750
IT'S NOT JUST ME. I HAVE
TALKED TO DOZENS OF PARENTS...

06:21.792 --> 06:23.750
YOU VACCINATED JEFFREY,

06:23.792 --> 06:27.583
AND IT WAS LIKE A LIGHT
WENT OUT INSIDE HIM,

06:27.625 --> 06:30.041
AND HE'S LIVING
IN SOME PARALLEL WORLD.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.041
ARLENE--
YOU DON'T LIVE WITH HIM.

06:32.083 --> 06:35.041
SO DON'T ASK ME

06:38.542 --> 06:41.041
(speaks indistinctly) HEY.

06:41.083 --> 06:43.041
HEY, I CAN'T GET AHOLD

06:43.083 --> 06:45.041
I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S BEEN IMMUNIZED.
MOST KIDS HAVE BEEN.

06:45.083 --> 06:48.083
YOU DON'T KNOW HER MOTHER, OKAY?
SHE FORGOT TO PICK HER UP.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.083
YOU THINK SHE REMEMBERED
DOCTOR VISITS?

06:50.125 --> 06:52.500
SH-SHOULD I JUST GIVE HER
THE SHOT TO BE SURE?

06:52.542 --> 06:55.000
I MEAN, SHE PLAYED WITH THAT KID
FOR, LIKE, A HALF-HOUR.
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS
TO GIVE THE VACCINE.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.375
SO WAIT FOR THE MOM AND ASK,
SPARE HER THE NEEDLE IF YOU CAN.

WE'RE CHECKING EVERY PATIENT

07:00.709 --> 07:03.834

FOR IMMUNIZATION.
HOW MANY OF THESE
ARE WE LOOKING AT, COOP?

07:03.875 --> 07:06.041
HOW MANY WHAT?
THESE LITTLE TIME BOMBS--

07:06.083 --> 07:09.041
KIDS COMING IN
WITHOUT THEIR VACCINATIONS.
THE VAST MAJORITY
OF MY PRACTICE IS PRO-VACCINE.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.041
WHETHER OR NOT TO VACCINATE

07:11.083 --> 07:14.041

WELL, IT ISN'T, BUT I AGREE

07:14.083 --> 07:16.041
WITH THE ACADEMY OF
AMERICAN PEDIATRICS

07:16.083 --> 07:18.083
THAT WE SHOULDN'T
ABANDON PATIENTS

07:18.125 --> 07:20.625
WHO CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE.
COOPER'S RIGHT.
YOU CAN'T KICK A KID OUT

07:20.667 --> 07:22.625
JUST BECAUSE THE PARENTS
BELIEVE IN A CONSPIRACY THEORY

07:22.667 --> 07:24.625
ABOUT VACCINES.
THE C.D.C. IS CLEAR--

07:24.667 --> 07:26.625
VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM,
THEY SAVE LIVES.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.041
THAT'S THE END OF STORY.

07:28.083 --> 07:32.041
HEY, I WAS JUST IN THE PEDIATRIC
WAITING AREA WITH BETSEY.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.083
UH, THIS IS MICHAEL'S MOM'S,
AND SHE LEFT IT IN THE LOBBY.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.125
SO IF SHE WAS DOWN
AT PACIFIC WELLCARE...

07:37.166 --> 07:39.125
THEN HER KIDS WERE, TOO.

07:39.166 --> 07:42.291

GOTTA TELL CHARLOTTE.

07:49.834 --> 07:52.041

HOW IS SHE... VIOLET?

08:04.792 --> 08:06.959
EXPOSED TO THE MEASLES.
EXPOSED TO THE MEASLES?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.041
A KID IN OUR PRACTICE
HAS THE MEASLES,

08:09.083 --> 08:11.041
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.
THIS CONCERNS ME HOW?

08:11.083 --> 08:13.041
WELL, YOU HAVE
THIS WONDERFUL COFFEE BAR

08:13.083 --> 08:15.542

SO PROMINENTLY,

08:15.583 --> 08:18.291
AND A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS
WANDER BY ON THEIR WAY UPSTAIRS.
IT IS GOOD COFFEE.

08:18.333 --> 08:21.959
YEAH.

PRACTICE TO THE MEASLES?

CLAUDIA JENKINS
NEEDS A SURGEON,

08:27.250 --> 08:29.917
A SURGEON WITH A BACKGROUND IN
BOTH GYNECOLOGY AND FERTILITY,

08:29.959 --> 08:32.000
SOMEONE WHO CAN IMPLANT
THE OVARIAN TISSUE

08:32.041 --> 08:34.000
CLOSE ENOUGH
TO THE UTERINE BLOOD SUPPLY

08:34.041 --> 08:36.917
TO ALLOW HER
TO PRODUCE HER OWN EGGS.

08:36.959 --> 08:41.208
NAOMI WAS RIGHT.
YOU WANT A MIRACLE.
NO, I WANT YOU--
JUST AS A SURGEON.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.041
YOU'D PERFORM THE PROCEDURE
AT ST. AMBROSE--

08:44.083 --> 08:45.375
NEUTRAL TERRITORY.

08:45.417 --> 08:48.041
YOU BILL ALL YOU WANT.
NAOMI AND I DO THE FOLLOW-UP.

08:48.083 --> 08:51.000
YOU JUST GO IN AND CUT
AND IMPLANT, AND YOU'RE DONE.

08:51.041 --> 08:54.041
CLAUDIA GETS A BABY. YOU'RE NOT
TAINTED BY WORKING WITH ME.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.041
TAKE A LOOK.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.667
TELL ME THAT THIS SURGERY
WOULDN'T BE AMAZING.

08:58.709 --> 09:00.959
YOU DON'T GET ME AT ALL.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.208
YOU THINK
ALL I WANT TO DO IS CUT?

09:04.250 --> 09:07.333
IF I DO A SURGERY,
I DO THE FOLLOW-UP.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.250
I MAKE SURE IT TAKES,

09:09.291 --> 09:11.250
I SEE THE PREGNANCY
THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH.

09:11.291 --> 09:14.333
NOW YOU MAY JUST LOOK
AT PROCEDURES AND OUTCOMES.

09:14.375 --> 09:18.041
BUT MY PATIENTS GET ME
FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS.

09:18.083 --> 09:21.041
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
EVEN BETTER.

09:21.083 --> 09:24.083
READ THE FILE,
DR. MONTGOMERY...

09:24.125 --> 09:26.750
BEFORE YOU SAY NO.

09:41.208 --> 09:43.667
ARE YOU STILL HAVING SEX

09:43.709 --> 09:45.959
WITH THE SAME GUY?

09:48.083 --> 09:49.834
WITH THE SAME GUY, HUH?

09:49.875 --> 09:52.875
FINALLY GONNA FESS UP
AND TELL ME WITH WHO?

09:52.917 --> 09:55.917
I TOLD YOU WHOM IT WAS,
AND YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.
WHO IT WAS,

09:55.959 --> 09:58.041
AND YOU TOLD ME PETE,
WHICH IS OBFUSCATION.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.917
LYING, REALLY.
IT'S PETE, COOPER.

10:00.959 --> 10:03.041
(chuckles)
I'M HAVING SEX WITH PETE.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.000
YOU NEED ME
TO PROVE IT TO YOU?

10:11.083 --> 10:13.041
LIFT YOUR SHIRT.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.041
(laughs) EXCUSE ME?
I NEED YOU TO LIFT UP
YOUR SHIRT.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.709
TRUST ME. I'M A DOCTOR.
YOU'RE A PEDIATRICIAN.
THAT'S LIKE HALF A DOCTOR.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.250
(chuckles) LIFT.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.875
THIS ISN'T
ONE OF YOUR WEIRD...

10:23.917 --> 10:25.875
THERE'S A TATTOO.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.291
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH VIOLET?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.959
DO YOU HAVE TO SLEEP
WITH EVERYBODY?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.667
I DON'T SLEEP
WITH EVERYBODY A--
YOU SLEEP WITH PEOPLE AND THEN
THEY LEAVE THE PRACTICE.

10:32.709 --> 10:35.583
DO YOU WANT VIOLET
TO LEAVE THE PRACTICE?
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.083
YOU TOLD HIM?
IT'S JUST SEX.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.750
OH, NO. YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF JUST HAVING SEX.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.000
YOU ARE A RELATIONSHIP JUNKIE.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.083
AND PETE IS
THE ANTI-RELATIONSHIP.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.917
PETE IS THE RUINER
OF RELATIONSHIPS. PETE IS--
PETE IS RIGHT HERE.

10:46.959 --> 10:50.250
AND YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE.
ISN'T THAT, LIKE, THE PROVERBIAL
POT CALLING THE KETTLE--

10:50.291 --> 10:52.542
COOPER, COOPER, COOPER,
I'M FINE.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.041
WE'RE FINE.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.917
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.959
(scoffs)

11:01.000 --> 11:04.125
CLAUDIA JENKINS
COULD HAVE A BABY.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.709
THANK YOU, ADDISON.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.041
THERE'S ONE CONDITION.
YES.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.417
THIS IS A ONE-TIME THING.
WE HELP CLAUDIA,

11:11.458 --> 11:13.834
AND THEN YOU ARE DONE
WORKING WITH WYATT.

11:13.875 --> 11:18.000
YOU'RE...
YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME.
NO, NO, IT'S NOT BLACKMAIL.
IT'S EXTORTION.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.000
I'M DOING THIS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, NAI.

11:20.041 --> 11:23.041
WHAT, SO--SO THAT I DON'T BECOME
CORRUPTED AND EVIL LIKE HIM,

11:23.083 --> 11:25.208
SO I DON'T EXTORT PROMISES
FROM MY FRIENDS?

11:25.250 --> 11:27.208
DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO THE SURGERY?

11:27.250 --> 11:30.208
I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.041
(scoffs)

11:34.083 --> 11:36.959
OKAY, SO THAT'S IT.
EVERYBODY'S BEEN IMMUNIZED.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.041
EVERYBODY THAT WAS HERE
HAS BEEN CONTACTED.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.041
YOU CAN REFILE ALL THESE
IMMUNIZATION RECORDS--

11:41.083 --> 11:42.625
OH, NO, HE CAN'T.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.667
SONYA NICHOLS.
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.750
I'M GONNA NEED THOSE.

11:47.792 --> 11:51.041
OH, UH, SAM BENNETT. I, UH,
I CALLED YOU. (laughs)

11:51.083 --> 11:53.583
UH, ARE--ARE THOSE ALL
THE IMMUNIZATION RECORDS?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.166
UH, YEAH. YEAH,
THIS IS EVERYTHING.

11:55.208 --> 11:58.000
OKAY, I WANT
THE VACCINATION RECORDS

11:58.041 --> 12:00.041
OF ALL THE PATIENTS
IN YOUR PRACTICE,

12:00.083 --> 12:02.917
AND THEN AFTER I INTERVIEW
ALL PERSONNEL

12:02.959 --> 12:05.041
AND REVIEW
THEIR EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATES,

12:05.083 --> 12:07.041
I'LL NEED TO INSPECT
YOUR ISOLATION FACILITIES.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.834
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE, UH,
ISOLATION FACILITIES PER SE,

12:09.875 --> 12:12.041
UH, BUT--WELL, WAIT. WE, UH,
WE PROVIDE FOR ROOMS.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.625
WE JUST--
ARE NOT
UP TO CURRENT GUIDELINES?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.041
OR ARE YOU AWARE

12:16.083 --> 12:18.917
OF THE RECENT CHANGES
IN THOSE STANDARDS?

12:20.458 --> 12:25.041
(chuckles) UH, THIS ISN'T
GONNA BE VERY MUCH FUN, IS IT?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.041
(laughs)
YOU WANT
TO SHOW ME AROUND?

12:27.083 --> 12:29.959
(clears throat) YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, THIS WAY.

12:33.542 --> 12:36.542
HIS--HIS FEVER, IT WAS 104
BY THE TIME I GOT HOME.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.333
I-I COULDN'T GET IT DOWN.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.250
HOW YOU FEELING, MICHAEL?

12:40.291 --> 12:42.291
I'M REALLY COLD,
AND MY STOMACH HURTS.
MM-HMM.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.959
HE VOMITED TWICE.
HIS LUNGS ARE CONGESTED.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.041
(coughing)
OH, OKAY. OKAY.

12:48.083 --> 12:51.041
OKAY, WE GOT YOU. IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU SOME FLUIDS,

12:51.083 --> 12:54.041
AND WE'LL BRING THAT FEVER DOWN,
AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.083
I NEED A NASAL CANNULA
AT 2 LITERS, CHEST X-RAYS

12:56.125 --> 12:58.542
AND CULTURES TIMES TWO.
(coughs)

12:58.583 --> 13:01.333
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY IS HE SO SICK?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.041
ARLENE, MEASLES IS SERIOUS.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.667
IT CAN LEAD TO PNEUMONIA,
ENCEPHALITIS--

13:05.709 --> 13:07.875
ALL SORTS
OF OTHER COMPLICATIONS.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.500
NOTIFY PEDS I.C.U.
WE NEED AN ISOLATION ROOM.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.917
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:25.917 --> 13:30.458
MICHAEL'S RESTING NOW.
HIS FEVER'S DOWN.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.792
BUT HE'S STILL
HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.041
MY HUSBAND IS--
IS STILL IN SWITZERLAND.

13:35.083 --> 13:38.041
YOU DON'T THINK HE...
NEEDS TO FLY BACK?

13:38.083 --> 13:41.500
IF IT WAS MY SON, I'D COME.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.917
ARLENE, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT WILL.

13:47.959 --> 13:49.917
I-I--NO. I TOLD YOU NO.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.583
NO VACCINATIONS.

13:51.625 --> 13:54.166
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN RISK
PUTTING WILL THROUGH

13:54.208 --> 13:56.166
WHAT MICHAEL'S GOING THROUGH.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.792
I CAN'T RISK
PUTTING WILL THROUGH

13:58.834 --> 14:00.041
WHAT JEFFREY'S GONE THROUGH.

14:00.083 --> 14:03.041
I LOST ONE CHILD TO AUTISM.
I CAN'T LOSE ANOTHER.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.333
ARLENE, YOU WON'T--

14:04.375 --> 14:07.041
DON'T YOU THINK SEEING MICHAEL
IN THERE LIKE THAT...

14:07.083 --> 14:09.834
(beeping continues)

14:09.875 --> 14:13.000
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR MY KIDS.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.208
I CAN'T.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.125
LOOK AT HIM.

14:17.166 --> 14:20.166
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHEN HE WAS 2, THAT SMILE?

14:20.208 --> 14:23.041
HE'D LIGHT UP THE ROOM.

14:23.083 --> 14:27.041
AND THEN YOU VACCINATED HIM,
AND THAT KID VANISHED.

14:27.083 --> 14:30.041
THOSE VACCINES
TOOK HIM AWAY.

14:30.083 --> 14:33.166
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU KNOW.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.041
I KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.667
I KNOW WHAT I LOST.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.667
I CAN'T RISK IT AGAIN.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS HEALTH DEPARTMENT LADY

14:46.083 --> 14:48.041
IS MAKING US
JUMP THROUGH ALL THESE HOOPS.
(scoffs) SHE'S HORRIBLE.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.834
HOW'S MICHAEL?

14:49.875 --> 14:53.041
UH, NOT GOOD, AND ARLENE STILL
WON'T LET ME VACCINATE WILL.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.041
YOU SHOULD CALL
FAMILY SERVICES.
YOU SERIOUS?

14:55.083 --> 14:57.667
YES, IT'S CHILD ABUSE.
SHE'S KNOWINGLY

14:57.709 --> 15:00.041
PUTTING HER SON AT RISK
FOR GETTING REALLY SICK.
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE.

15:00.083 --> 15:04.041
IT'S A PARENT'S DECISION.
YEAH, WELL, IF I FIND OUT THAT
HEATHER DIDN'T VACCINATE BETSEY,

15:04.083 --> 15:05.375
I'LL REPORT HER.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.041
CAN I SEE YOU A MOMENT,
DR. BENNETT?

15:08.083 --> 15:10.083
PERFECT.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.083
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.625
SAM'S RIGHT. I GOTTA CALL.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.041
CALLING D.C.F.S.
WHILE HER OTHER CHILD

15:16.083 --> 15:19.041
IS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL
WOULD JUST BE CRUEL.
CRUEL? PUTTING ANOTHER CHILD
IN DANGER IS CRUEL.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.375
EXPOSING A CITY TO MEASLES
IS CRUEL.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.667
VIOLET'S RIGHT. YOU CAN'T
FAULT THE MOTHER

15:23.709 --> 15:26.333
JUST BECAUSE SHE CHOSE
NOT TO--
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE
YOU'RE GONNA AGREE WITH VIOLET.

15:26.375 --> 15:29.083
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH HER.

15:33.959 --> 15:36.291
I AGREE WITH HER
BECAUSE SHE'S RIGHT,

15:36.333 --> 15:38.041
AND I'M SLEEPING WITH HER

15:38.083 --> 15:40.041
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE FUN
OF BEING AN ADULT.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.709
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT
WITH WHOMEVER WE WANT

15:42.750 --> 15:44.709
HOWEVER MUCH WE WANT.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.041
SO IF EVERYONE
WOULD JUST RELAX

15:47.083 --> 15:49.750
AND LET US
BE ADULTS ABOUT THIS...

15:55.291 --> 15:57.333
WE NEED TO GO OVER PROTOCOL.

15:57.375 --> 16:00.417
UM, HOW DID YOU DISPOSE OF
THE CONTAMINATED EXAM ITEMS

16:00.458 --> 16:02.333
USED ON THE SICK BOY?

16:02.375 --> 16:05.041
TONGUE DEPRESSORS, GLOVES,
THERMOMETER COVER?

16:05.083 --> 16:07.583
UH, WE USE A, UH,
A MEDICAL WASTE COMPANY.

16:07.625 --> 16:10.709
NEEDLESTICKS--DID YOU FOLLOW
C.D.C. APPROVED GUIDELINES?

16:10.750 --> 16:12.917
I-I-I ASSUME SO.

16:12.959 --> 16:14.125
I-I CAN CHECK, BUT--

16:14.166 --> 16:17.041
AND WHAT KIND OF
VENTILATION SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE?

16:17.083 --> 16:19.041
'CAUSE YOU'D BE AMAZED
HOW MANY PRACTICES

16:19.083 --> 16:21.333
DON'T HAVE
A LAMINAR FLOW ROOM.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.500
RIGHT. YES.
LAMINAR FLOW IS GOOD.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.875
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS, DO YOU?

16:25.917 --> 16:28.083
(chuckles) DR. NICHOLS,
LOOK, I'VE SPENT HOURS,

16:28.125 --> 16:30.125
UH, JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS
FOR YOU--

16:30.166 --> 16:33.041
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
JUMP THROUGH HOOPS.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.583
IT SHOULD ALL BE STANDARD.
IT SHOULD ALL BE COVERED

16:35.625 --> 16:37.583
IN YOUR PROCEDURES
AND POLICY MANUAL,

16:37.625 --> 16:40.166
WHICH IT'S REQUIRED BY LAW
YOU HAVE.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.625
SO I CAN SEE IT?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.041
YOU WANT TO SEE OUR P-PROCEDURES
AND POLICY MANUAL?

16:44.083 --> 16:46.041
YES.

16:46.083 --> 16:49.041
OKAY. LOOK, WE JUST
RENTED OUT A FLOOR

16:49.083 --> 16:50.750
AND MOVED ALL OUR FILES.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.208
SO IT MAY TAKE A WHILE.

16:53.250 --> 16:57.417
OKAY, WELL, YOU HAVE TILL
TOMORROW TO FIND IT.

17:04.083 --> 17:07.041
VIOLET HAS GOT TO KNOW
THAT THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR HER

17:07.083 --> 17:10.041
OR THE PRACTICE.
(chuckles) SAYS THE PERSON
WHO SLEPT WITH MY BROTHER.

17:10.083 --> 17:13.041
OH, NOW THAT WAS--
OH, DIFFERENT?

17:13.083 --> 17:15.041
OH, YEAH, TOTALLY
AND COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...
UH-HUH.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.542
IN EVERY WAY.

17:16.583 --> 17:20.000
WHAT?
ARE YOU OKAY WITH IT?
YEAH, SHE SEEMS HAPPY.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.417
PETE... SEEMS HAPPY,
YOU KNOW, I...
(footsteps approach)

17:22.458 --> 17:24.041
HI.
HI.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.417
CAN I HELP YOU?

17:25.458 --> 17:28.250
YEAH, I'M LOOKING
FOR DELL PARKER.
UH, YOU ARE?

17:28.291 --> 17:30.041
I'M HEATHER.
I'M BETSEY'S MOM.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.041
OH. UH, YEAH. HIS OFFICE
IS AT THE END OF THE HALL.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.041
IT'S THE LAST ONE.
THANK YOU.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.291
UH-HUH.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.041
THAT'S HEATHER?
SHE'S SO...

17:39.083 --> 17:42.041
SHE'S NOT AT ALL
WHAT I EXPECTED.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.458
(opens zipper)

17:48.500 --> 17:50.291
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

17:50.333 --> 17:52.000
(closes zipper)
VIOLET--

17:52.041 --> 17:55.000
I TOLD YOU TO TELL YOU,
NOT TO TELL EVERYONE.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.000
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
WHAT'S YOUR ISSUE? YOU--
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO BE HAPPY?

17:58.041 --> 18:00.000
OF COURSE I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

18:00.041 --> 18:03.000
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
ARE YOU JEALOUS OF PETE,
IS THAT IT?

18:03.041 --> 18:05.792
NO. NO.
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.041
LOOK, YOU HAVE
WHAT CHARLOTTE AND I HAD--

18:08.083 --> 18:10.333
THE "JUST SEX" PART--
BEFORE IT GOT ALL MESSED UP

18:10.375 --> 18:12.333
WITH EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS
AND BETRAYAL,

18:12.375 --> 18:14.709
WHICH IS WHERE THE "JUST SEX"
TRAIN ULTIMATELY LEADS.

18:14.750 --> 18:17.709
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT.
LOOK, THIS IS NOT
"ROMEO AND JULIET," COOP.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.125
THERE'S NOT
SOME TRAGEDY LOOMING.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.041
WE--WE HAD AN ITCH
AND WE SCRATCHED...

18:23.083 --> 18:25.542
AND SCRATCHED...
AND SCRATCHED.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.834
OKAY.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.041
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

18:28.083 --> 18:31.875
IT'S JUST THAT LAST TIME...
ALLAN--

18:31.917 --> 18:34.125
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, COOP.
I DO.

18:34.166 --> 18:37.041
I'M SORRY I TOLD...

18:37.083 --> 18:38.792
EVERYONE. (chuckles)

18:40.583 --> 18:42.125
CAN I PEE NOW?

18:42.166 --> 18:43.959
(gasps) YEAH.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.125
OKAY.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.083
(opens zipper)

18:49.417 --> 18:51.875
(knock on door)
MOMMY!

18:51.917 --> 18:53.959
I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW,
AND THEY REALLY LIKED ME,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.500
SO THEY MADE ME TAKE
ALL THESE DIFFERENT TESTS.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.917
IT TOOK FOREVER. I'M SORRY.

18:58.959 --> 19:02.542
BABE... WHY DON'T YOU
GO FINISH THAT PUZZLE, OKAY?

19:02.583 --> 19:04.917
MOMMY NEEDS TO TALK TO DADDY.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.875
YOU COULDN'T CALL?

19:13.917 --> 19:17.375
YOU LEAVE YOUR DAUGHTER ALONE
ALL DAY AND YOU DON'T CALL?

19:17.417 --> 19:19.792
I FORGOT MY PHONE.
ARE YOU USING?

19:19.834 --> 19:21.500
NO. NO.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.041
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE MAD,

19:23.083 --> 19:25.375
BUT I KNEW SHE WAS SAFE
WITH YOU, OKAY?

19:25.417 --> 19:27.375
I-I COULDN'T LEAVE
TO MAKE A CALL.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.041
I DID NOT WANT TO BLOW
THIS INTERVIEW.
WELL, SHE'S NOT SAFE, OKAY?

19:30.083 --> 19:33.083
SHE WAS EXPOSED
TO THE MEASLES TODAY,

19:33.125 --> 19:36.083
AND I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S VACCINATED BECAUSE,

19:36.125 --> 19:38.959
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AROUND ENOUGH,
AND YOU...

19:39.000 --> 19:41.041
IS SHE VACCINATED?

19:41.083 --> 19:42.041
UM...

19:42.083 --> 19:44.000
YOU DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.959
NO.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.458
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.625
NOT GOING HOME?

20:05.667 --> 20:09.458
UGH. IT'S BEEN
A HELL OF A DAY.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.625
YEAH,

20:11.667 --> 20:13.625
BUT A CUP
OF NON-FOURTH-FLOOR COFFEE,

20:13.667 --> 20:16.041
THE FRESH AIR, THE OCEAN--
IT ALL GOES AWAY.

20:16.083 --> 20:21.000
(laughs) LOOK AT YOU,
ALL CALM AND BUDDHIST.

20:23.250 --> 20:26.041
SO YOU AND VIOLET?

20:26.083 --> 20:29.500
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP.

20:29.542 --> 20:31.709
WELL...

20:31.750 --> 20:34.417
IF YOU'RE HAPPY...

20:34.458 --> 20:37.625
THINGS NOT GOING WELL
WITH YOU AND KEVIN?

20:37.667 --> 20:41.625
KEVIN AND I ARE...
DIFFERENT,

20:41.667 --> 20:43.625
AND I STILL HAVEN'T
FIGURED OUT

20:43.667 --> 20:46.625
IF THAT'S A GOOD THING
OR A BAD THING.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.041
YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

20:49.083 --> 20:50.667
PLEASE.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.166
IGNORE ALL ADVICE.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.166
COOPER IS ALL OVER VIOLET

20:54.208 --> 20:56.834
ABOUT HOW I'M GONNA
DESTROY HER LIFE.

20:56.875 --> 20:58.834
I JUST THINK
PEOPLE SHOULD BE LEFT

20:58.875 --> 21:00.333
TO DECIDE THINGS
FOR THEMSELVES.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.917
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ABOUT YOU AND KEVIN?

21:02.959 --> 21:05.333
ABOUT YOU AND VIOLET.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.041
OH.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.542
W-WELL, I...

21:08.583 --> 21:13.834
THE CONVERSATION IS EASY,
THE SEX IS... GOOD.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.333
(chuckles)

21:15.375 --> 21:18.834
WE LAUGH A LOT.
I MEAN, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.041
WE'RE JUST SIMILAR
AND WE WANT THE SAME THING,

21:21.083 --> 21:23.208
SO IT'S WORKING OUT.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.875
WHAT?

21:24.917 --> 21:28.875
YOU'VE GOT ALL THAT,
AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL?

21:28.917 --> 21:32.041
(laughs) ISN'T THAT
WHAT A RELATIONSHIP IS?

21:48.166 --> 21:51.375
OH, VIOLET. GOOD MORNING.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.250
HELLO, SHELDON.

21:53.291 --> 21:56.000
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.166
I'VE MISSED SEEING YOU.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.917
ELEVATOR RIDES ARE ALWAYS
MORE PLEASANT WITH YOU.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.750
HOLD THE ELEVATOR.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.542
GLAD TO SEE
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.041
(laughs)

22:20.083 --> 22:23.125
SO YOU LOOK...

22:23.166 --> 22:25.125
DID YOU
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

22:25.166 --> 22:27.000
Y-YOU LOOK GREAT.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.000
SHE DID
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

22:30.625 --> 22:34.542
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
JUST KEEP DOING IT.

22:38.917 --> 22:41.333
(Naomi) THERE'S A LITTLE BLEEDER
ON THE DISTAL UTERUS.

22:41.375 --> 22:45.041
GOT IT. HEY, DO YOU THINK
I MISSED THE BOAT WITH PETE?

22:45.083 --> 22:46.875
UGH. YOU DIDN'T MISS
THE PETE BOAT.

22:46.917 --> 22:49.875
YOU DODGED HURRICANE PETE.
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S GONNA END THAT BADLY?

22:49.917 --> 22:52.458
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE SAME PETE?
SORRY I'M LATE.
LOTS OF PATIENTS TO SAVE.

22:52.500 --> 22:56.041
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO
SAVE SOME MORE AND LET US WORK?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.041
WORK, OR DISCUSS
DATING COLLEAGUES?

22:58.083 --> 23:00.458
WHICH TRUTHFULLY, I CONCUR
IS A BAD IDEA.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.959
HOWEVER, SINCE THIS IS
OUR LAST CASE TOGETHER, MONTY,

23:03.000 --> 23:06.125
IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM FOR US.
SHE'S INVOLVED WITH A COP
WHO HAS A GUN.

23:06.166 --> 23:09.333
YEAH, SO YOU BETTER
WATCH OUT.
A COP? ARE YOU REALLY
DATING A COP?

23:09.375 --> 23:13.041
I AM NOT INTIMIDATED
BY A MAN WITH A GUN. ARE YOU?

23:13.083 --> 23:14.250
INTIMIDATED? HARDLY.

23:14.291 --> 23:16.250
NO, I WAS THINKING
OF THEIR PROPENSITY

23:16.291 --> 23:18.208
FOR DEPRESSION AND DIVORCE
AND ALCOHOLISM.

23:18.250 --> 23:20.208
YEAH,
AS OPPOSED TO DOCTORS,

23:20.250 --> 23:23.000
WHO HAVE A STABLE,
STRESS-FREE LIFE.
TRUE, TRUE, BUT I COULD SEE

23:23.041 --> 23:25.041
HOW A COP FULFILLS
SOME KIND OF BASE FANTASY

23:25.083 --> 23:28.375
FOR A WOMAN LIKE YOU.
WOW. DID YOU MISS
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEMINAR?

23:28.417 --> 23:30.834
WELL, I MEANT IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.667
I MEAN, SHE'S A RICH,
CLASSY WOMAN.

23:33.709 --> 23:36.834
HE'S YOUR VERSION
OF THE POOL BOY.
OKAY, ENOUGH.
YOU ARE HERE TO WATCH.

23:42.625 --> 23:45.083
YOU KNOW WHAT I GOT HERE?
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD, CHARLOTTE.

23:45.125 --> 23:48.041
PUBLIC HEALTH NOTIFICATIONS,
ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS,

23:48.083 --> 23:49.417
INCIDENT REPORTS,
C.D.C. SURVEYS.

23:49.458 --> 23:51.542
WE ALL HAVE JOBS TO DO.

23:51.583 --> 23:53.542
I HAVE JOBS I'M NOT ABLE TO DO

23:53.583 --> 23:56.041
BECAUSE I'M DEALING WITH
THE MESS YOU MADE.

23:56.083 --> 23:59.083
AND I HAVE A MOM WHO FEELS LIKE
SHE LOST ONE SON TO AUTISM

23:59.125 --> 24:02.041
AND MAY BE LOSING
ANOTHER ONE TO THE MEASLES,

24:02.083 --> 24:04.041
AND SHE'S GOT ANOTHER ONE
SITTING OUT HERE EXPOSED,

24:04.083 --> 24:06.291
AND MAYBE I'M JUST NOT
PERSUASIVE ENOUGH,

24:06.333 --> 24:08.041
BUT HE'S VULNERABLE,

24:08.083 --> 24:10.834
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA LET ME
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

24:10.875 --> 24:14.041
SO I'M REALLY SORRY IF I
PILED ON SOME PAPERWORK FOR YOU,

24:14.083 --> 24:18.125
BUT I DON'T NEED CRAP
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW.
HE CAN'T BREATHE.

24:21.542 --> 24:23.291
FULL CUSTODY?

24:23.333 --> 24:26.333
YOU WANT FULL CUSTODY?
I'M TRYING
TO KEEP BETSEY SAFE.

24:26.375 --> 24:28.041
NOW? NOW THAT I'VE CHANGED?

24:28.083 --> 24:30.041
NOW THAT I'M FINALLY
GETTING IT TOGETHER?

24:30.083 --> 24:33.041
YOU LEFT HER HERE ALL DAY.
BUT I GOT THE JOB, DELL.

24:33.083 --> 24:36.750
OKAY, BUT... HOW LONG
UNTIL YOU BLOW IT OFF

24:36.792 --> 24:38.750
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU HATE IT

24:38.792 --> 24:41.083
OR YOU'RE BORED
OR YOU START USING AGAIN?

24:41.125 --> 24:42.375
I GOT THE JOB,

24:42.417 --> 24:45.041
AND THEN I GOT HOME
AND I GOT THIS LETTER.

24:45.083 --> 24:47.041
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANTED TO DO,

24:47.083 --> 24:48.792
BUT I DIDN'T, OKAY?

24:48.834 --> 24:52.792
I FREAKED, BUT THEN I LOOKED
AT BETSEY, AND I DIDN'T USE.

24:52.834 --> 24:56.041
I CAME HERE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

24:58.166 --> 25:02.041
I'M GLAD
YOU DIDN'T GET HIGH.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.291
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THINGS.

25:04.333 --> 25:07.041
ALL YOU SEE IS THAT GIRL
FROM THE VALLEY

25:07.083 --> 25:10.083
THAT YOU
USED TO GET HIGH WITH.
I STOPPED.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.917
WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN
STRONGER THAN ME THEN,

25:12.959 --> 25:15.125
BUT DON'T FORGET
WHO GOT ME STARTED, OKAY?

25:15.166 --> 25:19.625
BECAUSE I WASN'T
ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.625
JUST DON'T MAKE ME SPEND
EVERY LAST DIME THAT I HAVE

25:22.667 --> 25:24.125
TRYING TO FIGHT YOU.

25:24.166 --> 25:28.583
IT'S GONNA PUSH ME
BACK OVER THE EDGE.

25:32.667 --> 25:35.834
EVERY BIT OF TISSUE
AROUND HER OVARIES IS FRIABLE.

25:35.875 --> 25:38.041
I CAN'T PLACE A STITCH
WITHOUT HER STARTING TO BLEED.

25:38.083 --> 25:41.041
HOW MUCH CHEMO DID YOU GIVE HER?
I DID WHAT I HAD TO
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.792
NO, THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD.
I'VE GOTTA CLEAR THE FIELD.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.417
DAMN IT.
YOU NEED TO IMPLANT
THE TISSUE NOW.

25:46.458 --> 25:49.625
EVERYTHING I TOUCH BLEEDS.
WE CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU HAVE TIME
TO CONTROL THE BLEEDING

25:49.667 --> 25:52.000
AND TO COMPLETE THE IMPLANT.
BACK OFF, WYATT.

25:52.041 --> 25:55.041
I CAN'T SEE THE TARGET
THROUGH THE BLOOD...

25:55.083 --> 25:57.417
AND HER PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
IF YOU DON'T
GET THIS DONE NOW,

25:57.458 --> 26:00.875
SHE LOSES ANY CHANCE
OF EVER HAVING A BABY.
IF I DON'T STOP
THE HEMORRHAGING, SHE DIES,

26:00.917 --> 26:03.041
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT A BABY.
(Naomi) ADDISON.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.667
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE DONE.
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:05.709 --> 26:09.041
WYATT, SHUT YOUR MOUTH
WHILE I SAVE HER LIFE.

26:09.083 --> 26:12.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:12.083 --> 26:14.709
IT WON'T PASS.
HIS THROAT'S TOO SWOLLEN.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.041
(sighs) GET
THE FIBER-OPTIC SCOPE NOW.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.458
WE GOTTA VENTILATE HIM.
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:19.500 --> 26:22.041
HEART RATE IS DROPPING.
SATs ARE BOTTOMING OUT.

26:22.083 --> 26:24.291
WHERE'S THE DAMN SCOPE?
IT'S COMING, COOPER.

26:24.333 --> 26:28.291
OPEN UP A SURGICAL TRAY.
I'M GONNA CRIKE HIM. HOLD THIS.

26:28.333 --> 26:30.709
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

26:30.750 --> 26:33.041
JUST WAIT, COOPER.
THE SCOPE'S COMING.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.750
HIS HEART'S 40.
I'M DOING THIS. BETADINE.

26:35.792 --> 26:38.041
(beeping continues)

26:38.083 --> 26:40.041
WAIT. WAIT!

26:40.083 --> 26:43.750
(beeping continues)

26:45.458 --> 26:48.041
SLOWLY. EASY DOES IT.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.875
ALMOST THERE. ALMOST THERE.

26:50.917 --> 26:53.709
I GOT IT.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.041
(beeping stops)

26:55.083 --> 26:58.291
(ventilator whooshing)

26:58.333 --> 27:01.083
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:01.125 --> 27:03.041
SOUNDS GOOD.
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

27:03.083 --> 27:05.083
(glove snaps)

27:05.125 --> 27:06.875
(beeping continues)

27:06.917 --> 27:08.291
(glove snaps)

27:08.333 --> 27:10.500
(ventilator continues whooshing)

27:10.542 --> 27:14.542
SET THE VENT AT AN F102
OF 100, RATE OF 24.

27:14.583 --> 27:17.000
I NEED A MINUTE.

27:21.041 --> 27:24.083
HEY, I'LL WATCH 'EM
FOR A MINUTE.

27:24.125 --> 27:26.083
HEY.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.333
COME HERE.
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

27:28.375 --> 27:30.041
AHH.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.000
(clicks tongue)

27:33.792 --> 27:36.000
ONE SECOND.
GET THE HELL
AWAY FROM MY SON.

27:36.041 --> 27:38.041
MOMMY!
YOU HAVE TO STOP.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.000
YOUR SON IS DYING IN THERE.
GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME.

27:39.041 --> 27:42.041
(Will whimpers)
MRS. PERKINS, PLEASE.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.166
NO!
(Cooper) GOOD.

27:56.083 --> 27:57.500
WILL, ARE YOU OKAY?

27:57.542 --> 27:59.500
THE VACCINE IS SAFE.

27:59.542 --> 28:01.000
YOU DON'T KNOW.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.291
IT IS.
LOOK AT HIM
AND TELL ME IT IS.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.041
VACCINES ARE THE STANDARD
OF CARE.

28:06.083 --> 28:10.542
DR. FREEDMAN DID SOMETHING
THAT WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY.
HE ASSAULTED MY SON.

28:10.583 --> 28:13.875
AND I AM GOING TO SUE
THIS HOSPITAL, SO HELP ME,

28:13.917 --> 28:15.250
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HIM.

28:15.291 --> 28:18.041
I DID WHAT I FELT I HAD TO.

28:18.083 --> 28:21.250
IT WASN'T YOURS TO DO.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.208
IT WASN'T YOURS TO DO.

28:26.250 --> 28:29.458
(man) CODE BLUE, P.I.C.U.
CODE BLUE, P.I.C.U.

28:29.500 --> 28:33.041
(monitor beeping erratically)

28:33.083 --> 28:38.583
I WENT UNDER THINKING ABOUT
THE CRIB IN THE YELLOW ROOM.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.792
I WISH WE COULD'VE DONE MORE.

28:40.834 --> 28:43.625
I KNOW I SHOULD JUST BE GRATEFUL
FOR BEING ALIVE.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.250
WE ALL WANTED TO HELP YOU.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.458
AND I'M NOT GIVING UP,
CLAUDIA.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.834
I'LL BE BACK LATER, OKAY?

28:52.875 --> 28:55.834
NAI, WOULD YOU GO OVER POST-OP
INSTRUCTIONS WITH CLAUDIA?

28:55.875 --> 28:58.625
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.250
(door opens)

29:00.291 --> 29:02.166
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
THAT WAS ABOUT
MY EMBARRASSMENT

29:02.208 --> 29:05.041
FOR PICKING THE WRONG PERSON
FOR THE JOB.
YOU'RE BLAMING THIS ON ME?

29:05.083 --> 29:07.458
THE CHEMO RAVAGED
HER ENTIRE BODY.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.458
THERE WEREN'T 2 SQUARE
CENTIMETERS OF HEALTHY TISSUE

29:09.500 --> 29:12.166
THAT COULD'VE HELD A SUTURE
LET ALONE AN IMPLANT.

29:12.208 --> 29:15.041
YOU TALK LIKE
YOU SEARCHED EXHAUSTIVELY.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:15.083 --> 29:18.417
YOU DIDN'T PUSH.
I AGREED TO DO A TOTALLY
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

29:18.458 --> 29:21.041
THAT, GOING IN, WE ALL KNEW
WAS A LONGSHOT,

29:21.083 --> 29:23.041
AND WHEN I FELT THE RISKS
TO THE PATIENT'S LIFE

29:23.083 --> 29:25.041
OUTWEIGHED THE POTENTIAL
FOR SUCCESS,

29:25.083 --> 29:27.083
I CHOSE TO SAVE THE PATIENT.
YOU HAD TIME.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.041
YOU COULD'VE CONTROLLED
THE BLEEDING

29:29.083 --> 29:30.959
AND IMPLANTED THE TISSUE,
BUT YOU HATE ME,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.959
SO YOU DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOLD
WHAT TO DO, SO YOU STOPPED.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.208
YOU WANTED TO PROVE
THAT YOU KNEW BETTER.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.208
I'M NO SURGEON,
BUT I THINK THERE WAS TIME.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.208
WELL, I'M SORRY
IF WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE

29:40.250 --> 29:43.542
DIDN'T PRODUCE THE RESULTS
THAT YOU WANTED FOR SOME STUDY,

29:43.583 --> 29:46.959
BUT I MADE THE RIGHT CALL.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

29:55.208 --> 29:57.166

ON WORK-RELATED INJURIES

30:16.625 --> 30:19.291

A VERY THOROUGH JOB.

31:07.709 --> 31:09.667
IF THERE WERE
A SERIOUS OUTBREAK HERE,

31:09.709 --> 31:13.041
YOU'D WANT SOMEONE LIKE ME,
BECAUSE I AM A REAL DOCTOR

31:13.083 --> 31:15.625

31:17.417 --> 31:19.375

LOOKED ME IN THE EYE

31:25.583 --> 31:29.125

31:29.166 --> 31:31.208

31:34.250 --> 31:36.166

DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE?

31:52.125 --> 31:55.083
UGH! LOOK, IF ONE MORE PERSON
BUTTS IN AND TRIES TO TELL ME

31:55.125 --> 31:57.875
WHAT PETE IS
AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING--

31:57.917 --> 32:00.458
WOW. UH, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT HEATHER.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.417
OH.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.834
OKAY. SO YOU AND HEATHER...

32:04.875 --> 32:07.083

32:07.125 --> 32:10.083
THAT SHE'S NOT THE PERSON
SHE USED TO BE,

32:10.125 --> 32:13.625
AND... THAT BY TAKING CUSTODY
OF BETSEY,

32:13.667 --> 32:15.959
I'M PUNISHING HER
FOR HER PAST.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.250

I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN BELIEVE IT,

32:18.291 --> 32:21.875

PROTECT YOUR DAUGHTER.

32:21.917 --> 32:23.125

32:23.166 --> 32:26.041

IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT,
I COULDN'T DO WHAT I DO.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.750
