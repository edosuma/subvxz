WEBVTT

00:01.558 --> 00:04.569
Previously on The Expanse...

00:06.644 --> 00:08.247
We only have two torpedoes left.

00:08.248 --> 00:10.351
PDC rounds are under 10%.

00:10.352 --> 00:11.826
We're in a war with no bullets.

00:11.828 --> 00:14.897
Maybe now would be a good time
for you to tell me why you're here.

00:14.898 --> 00:18.617
I need to send a tight-beam to
Admiral Souther on the "Agatha King."

00:18.618 --> 00:21.068
Secretary Errinwright
commissioned Jules-Pierre Mao

00:21.070 --> 00:24.080
to manufacture protomolecule
hybrid soldiers.

00:24.081 --> 00:26.478
Did you see how Katoa jumped really high?

00:26.479 --> 00:29.845
Dr. Strickland says one day, I
might be able to jump like that.

00:29.846 --> 00:31.979
I hope I can.

00:31.981 --> 00:34.683
What we are doing is hard.
We have to be strong.

00:34.685 --> 00:36.188
The experiment is over. Shut it down.

00:36.189 --> 00:38.829
You're not going to Io to
destroy the protomolecule.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.113
You're going because Earth
doesn't have a sample,

00:41.114 --> 00:43.076
and you need one to stay in the game.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.092
I need you to lead a salvage mission.

00:45.094 --> 00:46.561
Bring back the "Nauvoo."

00:46.563 --> 00:48.664
We're gonna retrofit
the ship for the Belt.

00:48.665 --> 00:50.568
I'll be addressing the General Assembly.

00:50.569 --> 00:52.638
I want you to help me write it.

00:52.639 --> 00:54.923
Every loss that we inflict on Mars

00:54.924 --> 00:56.441
pushes them closer to launch.

00:56.442 --> 00:58.506
- A preemptive strike.
- Yes.

00:58.508 --> 01:00.180
If this doesn't work, millions will die.

01:00.181 --> 01:02.123
Do you know precisely how many lives

01:02.124 --> 01:04.983
a leader must sacrifice
and still be a good man?

01:04.983 --> 01:06.548
As few as possible.

01:06.550 --> 01:08.299
This isn't about defeating Mars.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.553
Eros proved that no one on
this planet's safe anymore.

01:11.555 --> 01:12.721
And we need to end this,

01:12.723 --> 01:15.623
because we don't know who
or what our next enemy is.

01:15.625 --> 01:16.724
Fire.

01:19.543 --> 01:22.165
We have a confirmed
launch from target five.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.498
They got one off before we hit them.

01:24.555 --> 01:28.240
Total population in the blast
zone approximately 2 million.

01:28.241 --> 01:29.191
Didn't need to happen.

01:29.192 --> 01:31.473
If only he hadn't wavered.

It's this one.

06:33.649 --> 06:35.782
We have secured the "Nauvoo."

06:35.784 --> 06:38.318
We'll begin retrofit immediately.

BATTLEFIELD DEBRIS
EN ROUTE TO IO

07:15.229 --> 07:18.163
You okay?

07:18.165 --> 07:20.900
I was just wondering if I
knew any of these people...

07:22.703 --> 07:24.336
If I served with them.

07:26.306 --> 07:28.807
We're running on empty.

07:28.809 --> 07:30.275
Yeah.

07:30.277 --> 07:33.045
Half the fleet is hunting
our two new passengers,

07:33.047 --> 07:35.714
and we're flying into a war zone.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.016
We need a resupply.

07:37.018 --> 07:38.316
By robbing graves.

07:38.318 --> 07:40.764
I feel the same way, but
what else can we do?

07:40.765 --> 07:42.821
Dead people don't need their stuff.

07:45.227 --> 07:47.392
It's a smart idea, Alex.

07:53.442 --> 07:55.333
Find us a likely candidate.

07:57.066 --> 07:59.589
DEATH TOLL CONTINUES TO RISE

08:05.947 --> 08:09.281
I don't know how you can
stand to wear that thing.

08:09.283 --> 08:12.284
It's the skin of my enemy.

08:12.286 --> 08:15.220
I guess that makes this
the skin of my ex.

08:15.222 --> 08:16.521
Naomi gave us these.

08:16.523 --> 08:18.837
They'll let us read
newsfeeds, talk to the crew,

08:18.838 --> 08:20.575
but no communications beyond the ship.

08:20.576 --> 08:23.696
Didn't they train you to
bend people to your will?

08:23.698 --> 08:26.331
I can't even make you do what
I want, and you're half my size.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.969
Look, I'm a shooter, not a spy.

08:29.971 --> 08:32.370
I don't usually solve problems
with my people skills.

08:32.371 --> 08:34.371
I solve problems by talking.

08:34.374 --> 08:36.775
I need that open channel to Souther.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.211
But Holden is dead set on
staying out of the war.

08:39.212 --> 08:40.879
I'm betting he won't let you issue orders

08:40.881 --> 08:42.881
to an admiral over his radio.

08:42.883 --> 08:44.349
I've met his mother.

08:44.718 --> 08:48.836
I get the impression he won't
be able to ride the fence for long.

08:48.869 --> 08:50.723
Let's give him a push.

09:07.675 --> 09:09.975
The "Kittur Chennamma." Fast attack boat.

09:09.977 --> 09:12.145
I've delivered my fair
share of ammo to these.

09:12.146 --> 09:14.813
Looks like they were taken
out of the fight early.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.116
PDCs weren't even deployed.

09:19.353 --> 09:20.653
This is the one.

09:20.655 --> 09:21.787
This debris field has a few black boxes

09:21.789 --> 09:24.790
sending out automated location signals.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.491
We shouldn't hang around here too long.

09:26.493 --> 09:28.761
Then let's work fast.

09:28.763 --> 09:30.195
Secure for docking.

09:30.197 --> 09:31.764
Let's get this done.

09:31.766 --> 09:33.766
Copy that.

09:33.768 --> 09:36.201
Project Caliban is more
than just a stable

09:36.203 --> 09:38.103
protohybrid supersoldier.

09:38.105 --> 09:41.206
It is also a state-of-the-art
weapons delivery system,

09:41.208 --> 09:43.876
as the following images show.

09:43.878 --> 09:46.278
Doc, I thought we learned our lessons

09:46.280 --> 09:49.948
about leaving tools unsecured in zero G.

09:49.950 --> 09:51.016
Haven't you watched that enough?

09:51.018 --> 09:54.519
Amos, they're manufacturing these things,

09:54.521 --> 09:56.822
twisting humans into monsters on purpose.

09:56.824 --> 09:59.291
How could you do that to another person?

09:59.293 --> 10:01.860
I think you and I had very
different childhoods.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.261
The weaponized hybrid is placed inside

10:03.263 --> 10:04.697
a fluid suspension pod

10:04.699 --> 10:06.832
and then placed inside
a delivery vehicle.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.968
Look, I needed to believe if
that was Mei on the hull,

10:09.970 --> 10:11.804
helping to kill her

10:11.806 --> 10:15.908
would be the worst thing
that I could ever do.

10:15.910 --> 10:18.510
I don't know if that's true anymore.

10:21.816 --> 10:23.816
Secure that,

10:23.818 --> 10:25.483
and then Cap and I need your help.

10:38.460 --> 10:41.702
MCRN

10:56.183 --> 10:57.950
Railgun round took out life support

10:57.952 --> 11:00.219
and the main water tank.

11:00.221 --> 11:03.055
No oxygen, no way to make more.

11:03.057 --> 11:05.290
Bad day.

11:05.292 --> 11:07.192
But brief.

11:07.194 --> 11:08.560
Okay, guys, you're gonna be coming up

11:08.562 --> 11:10.511
to an access panel just about now.

11:10.512 --> 11:13.866
That's gonna put you right
beside one of those PDCs.

11:13.868 --> 11:15.200
Copy that.

11:15.202 --> 11:17.269
I guess we just wait.

11:17.271 --> 11:19.471
Hurry up and wait.

11:19.473 --> 11:22.440
I remember that being the
essence of my military life.

11:22.442 --> 11:25.244
I'm sorry you're having to see this.

11:25.246 --> 11:26.879
Yeah, well,

11:26.881 --> 11:29.281
it's gonna be worse inside.

11:29.283 --> 11:30.249
You know, I'm gonna go and...

11:30.251 --> 11:32.050
make something nice for everyone

11:32.052 --> 11:34.352
when they get back.

11:34.872 --> 11:38.290
I used to know this fantastic
recipe for red kibble.

11:38.292 --> 11:39.124
Red kibble?

11:39.126 --> 11:40.558
A Belter staple.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.227
Hot and spicy.

11:44.031 --> 11:46.165
Are you offering to cook?

11:46.167 --> 11:47.132
- Yeah.
- I mean, you don't have to.

11:47.134 --> 11:48.937
- I know I don't!
- No, no, no.

11:48.938 --> 11:51.703
What I meant was, that's really nice.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.246
Amos.

12:10.925 --> 12:12.291
Almost full!

12:12.293 --> 12:13.591
It's a bullet party.

12:13.593 --> 12:15.593
Come on, Doc, let's get to work.

12:15.595 --> 12:19.431
Alex, the ship's drive looked intact.

12:19.433 --> 12:21.666
If we can get the drive online,

12:21.668 --> 12:22.935
we can put some distance between us

12:22.937 --> 12:24.636
and the rest of the debris while we work.

12:24.638 --> 12:25.770
Already on it.

12:25.772 --> 12:28.374
Let's see if we can't
get the "Kittur" to listen.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.008
With the "Razorback" and this junker,

12:30.010 --> 12:31.143
we'll have ourselves a convoy.

12:31.145 --> 12:33.570
Ask Naomi to do a full safety check.

12:33.571 --> 12:36.281
Then see if you can fire it up remotely.

12:36.283 --> 12:39.017
Might make the work easier with
some lights and gravity too.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.385
Roger that.

12:49.296 --> 12:51.230
Everyone stop moving.

12:51.232 --> 12:52.331
What?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.333
What's happening?

12:54.335 --> 12:56.468
I just felt something.

13:12.652 --> 13:16.054
SOS.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.789
Someone's alive in here.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.610
Where's Holden? I need to talk
to him about this comm situation.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.513
What are you doing?

13:29.515 --> 13:32.682
We used nearly all our
ammunition saving you two.

13:32.684 --> 13:34.484
So they're stripping our dead,

13:34.486 --> 13:35.585
and you're okay with this?

13:35.587 --> 13:36.686
Nobody asked you.

13:38.724 --> 13:41.625
Why are they setting up
an emergency airlock?

13:41.627 --> 13:42.592
Rescue operation.

13:42.594 --> 13:44.328
They might've found some survivors,

13:44.330 --> 13:45.796
and if we hadn't been stripping the dead,

13:45.798 --> 13:46.596
we wouldn't have.

13:46.598 --> 13:47.793
Blister seal is good.

13:47.794 --> 13:48.965
We're pressurized.

14:03.782 --> 14:05.782
Are we too late?

14:15.894 --> 14:17.727
I knew Mars wouldn't leave us behind.

14:22.655 --> 14:25.589
THE U.N. BUILDING
NEW YORK CITY

14:25.590 --> 14:28.726
SPECIAL SESSION OF THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLY

14:35.038 --> 14:36.269
GOIÃS MAIOR AFTERMATH

14:36.270 --> 14:38.691
DEATH TOLL CONTINUES TO
RISE AS NEW REPORTS COME IN

14:38.692 --> 14:41.918
I know what you're thinking.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.570
You're wondering, could
this have been avoided?

14:44.571 --> 14:46.490
Of course I am.

14:46.492 --> 14:48.459
What kind of person would
want something like this?

14:48.461 --> 14:49.559
Mars wanted it.

14:49.561 --> 14:51.761
They claim we fired first over Ganymede

14:51.763 --> 14:52.896
and it was their right.

14:52.898 --> 14:54.776
But this is what they've
wanted for decades.

14:56.502 --> 14:59.403
The General Assembly will
convene in five minutes.

14:59.405 --> 15:01.938
Please take your seats.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.641
You wrote a wonderful speech.

15:04.643 --> 15:07.544
You should be front and center.

15:07.546 --> 15:09.308
I come before you

15:09.309 --> 15:12.182
in a moment of terrible tragedy...

15:13.419 --> 15:15.085
Carrying, as we all do,

15:15.087 --> 15:16.786
the heartbreaking sorrow

15:16.788 --> 15:20.491
of our nearly 2 million dead.

15:22.794 --> 15:25.529
But we are also

15:25.531 --> 15:27.197
at a singular moment

15:27.199 --> 15:29.133
in history.

15:29.135 --> 15:30.967
We have been confronted by the unknown

15:30.969 --> 15:33.737
in a way that is unprecedented.

15:33.739 --> 15:35.839
Activity first on Eros,

15:35.841 --> 15:36.873
now on Venus.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.375
The unmistakable existence

15:38.377 --> 15:43.547
of advanced alien life
whose mission and purpose

15:43.549 --> 15:45.549
we cannot fathom.

15:45.551 --> 15:47.520
We must not shy away from this

15:47.521 --> 15:50.020
or pretend otherwise.

15:50.022 --> 15:52.489
The one thing that we know for certain,

15:52.491 --> 15:55.992
the one thing I can offer, is this:

15:55.994 --> 15:58.995
humanity has faced the
unprecedented before.

15:58.997 --> 16:02.166
We have discovered the unimagined wonders

16:02.168 --> 16:04.768
and terrors before.

16:04.770 --> 16:07.071
And through our courage,
vision, and faith...

16:07.073 --> 16:09.506
both through our purpose
and in one another...

16:09.508 --> 16:11.675
we have seen our way through

16:11.677 --> 16:13.544
even the darkest nights.

16:13.546 --> 16:15.845
And I am here to tell you from my heart

16:15.847 --> 16:18.182
that we will do so again.

16:24.223 --> 16:25.956
The first step,

16:25.958 --> 16:29.859
that most necessary and
fundamental beginning,

16:29.861 --> 16:32.129
is for humanity as a whole to recognize

16:32.131 --> 16:34.698
that we are one people.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.033
Arguments over faction and party

16:37.035 --> 16:39.636
must be set aside so that
we can turn our attention

16:39.638 --> 16:42.539
to this most pressing mystery.

16:42.541 --> 16:44.575
And that, I must tell you

16:44.577 --> 16:45.842
with the greatest sorrow,

16:45.844 --> 16:50.847
is the truth that Mars
has turned away from.

16:50.849 --> 16:53.617
Given a chance to transcend our history,

16:53.619 --> 16:55.586
Mars has instead insisted

16:55.588 --> 16:57.821
on what it calls independence,

16:57.823 --> 17:00.591
which is actually no more
than a justification

17:00.593 --> 17:02.892
for war and violence.

17:02.894 --> 17:05.795
It looks upon this terrible
and miraculous moment,

17:05.797 --> 17:07.931
and they see it as an opportunity

17:07.933 --> 17:10.166
to revisit ancient grievances,

17:10.169 --> 17:12.236
to get one over on Earth,

17:12.238 --> 17:13.569
to score points.

17:13.571 --> 17:17.007
They have lost sight of
our shared humanity,

17:17.009 --> 17:20.611
and so they must be reminded.

17:20.613 --> 17:21.911
It is our duty,

17:21.913 --> 17:24.013
not as the government of Earth

17:24.016 --> 17:26.782
but as the moral leaders of our species,

17:26.785 --> 17:29.186
to unify our factions,

17:29.188 --> 17:30.554
to definitively end

17:30.556 --> 17:33.056
the divisions between our planets,

17:33.058 --> 17:37.294
to be what we have always been:

17:37.296 --> 17:39.296
one race,

17:39.298 --> 17:40.964
one human race,

17:40.966 --> 17:43.267
under one unified flag,

17:43.269 --> 17:45.101
and, together, move forward

17:45.103 --> 17:48.872
into this brave new chapter of history.

18:01.787 --> 18:02.952
Thank you for your help.

18:15.270 --> 18:17.788
ARBOGHAST PHENOMENON CONTINUES

18:18.634 --> 18:20.794
PROTOMOLECULE ACTIVITY INCREASING

18:29.715 --> 18:31.181
Is the pod assembly on schedule?

18:31.183 --> 18:32.649
Yes, sir.

18:32.893 --> 18:35.574
We'll be ready to turn over the whole
system once the "Agatha King" arrives.

18:35.575 --> 18:38.213
I want all the data cores
and backups on my shuttle.

18:38.214 --> 18:38.755
Of course.

18:38.757 --> 18:40.324
And prep the children for travel.

18:40.326 --> 18:41.991
They'll all be coming with me.

18:41.993 --> 18:43.727
Sir, I'm...

18:43.729 --> 18:47.797
I'm afraid that not all
of the children survived.

18:47.799 --> 18:51.401
Do I need to specify surviving children?

18:51.403 --> 18:52.502
Of course not.

18:52.504 --> 18:54.371
I'll get on it right away, sir.

18:57.876 --> 18:59.643
No other line of research has come close

18:59.645 --> 19:02.011
to this level of success.

19:02.013 --> 19:05.048
Unwillingness to shoulder
the burden of history.

19:15.728 --> 19:17.761
How are you feeling?

19:17.763 --> 19:19.896
Dizzy.

19:19.898 --> 19:21.765
Attempting to reassess.

19:27.773 --> 19:29.205
Take him off the phase-three serum,

19:29.207 --> 19:31.040
and prep for biomass infusion.

19:31.042 --> 19:33.710
Yes, sir.

19:33.712 --> 19:37.213
You are doing great.

19:38.784 --> 19:41.785
I think you may have received
your last injection.

19:41.787 --> 19:43.387
No more medicine?

19:43.389 --> 19:45.455
You don't need it anymore.

19:45.457 --> 19:47.457
You're gonna be fine.

19:49.762 --> 19:52.729
So...

19:52.731 --> 19:54.931
beautiful.

19:54.933 --> 19:57.033
You certainly are.

20:10.754 --> 20:13.445
I had almost given up, you know?

20:14.215 --> 20:15.865
Dust to dust.

20:15.867 --> 20:17.167
I wasn't worried.

20:17.169 --> 20:19.035
We don't leave our people behind.

20:19.037 --> 20:20.370
Yeah.

20:22.073 --> 20:23.740
Hey, Cap.

20:23.742 --> 20:25.242
Officer on deck!

20:25.244 --> 20:26.409
Ensign Sinopoli.

20:26.411 --> 20:29.045
Sir, this is Ensign Loftis.

20:29.047 --> 20:32.570
The sleepyhead over here
is Ensign Ranhofer,

20:32.571 --> 20:34.717
and the lieutenant...

20:34.719 --> 20:36.620
How's the lieutenant?

20:40.192 --> 20:41.858
I'm sorry, guys.

20:41.860 --> 20:42.892
He didn't make it.

20:45.364 --> 20:47.197
Shit!

20:49.201 --> 20:51.234
It's not right.

20:52.237 --> 20:54.037
We lost our command deck right away.

20:54.039 --> 20:55.405
It was cut clean off.

20:55.407 --> 20:57.874
The whole ship was flashing
lights and alarms.

20:57.876 --> 20:59.242
Then in one second, all the air was gone.

20:59.244 --> 21:00.777
We were below.

21:00.779 --> 21:01.911
I didn't know what to do.

21:01.913 --> 21:04.347
I forgot every last bit of my training.

21:04.349 --> 21:07.217
The lieutenant grabbed us one by one,

21:07.219 --> 21:09.886
shoved us into the
compartment, and sealed it up.

21:09.888 --> 21:12.955
We got punchy with the air so thin.

21:14.826 --> 21:16.859
I didn't know the LT was...

21:20.899 --> 21:22.965
Is he gonna be okay?

21:22.967 --> 21:23.833
Yeah.

21:23.835 --> 21:25.268
Yeah, with some time.

21:30.442 --> 21:32.475
You're out of uniform.

21:40.252 --> 21:43.286
That's a "Tachi" jumpsuit.

21:43.288 --> 21:45.088
This is the "Tachi."

21:45.090 --> 21:46.423
You're James Holden.

21:46.425 --> 21:48.091
All right, easy... easy, guys.

21:48.093 --> 21:49.792
This is a stolen Martian ship.

21:49.794 --> 21:50.993
It's our boat now.

21:53.965 --> 21:56.299
So, what, we're prisoners of war?

21:56.301 --> 21:58.301
No, because we're not in this war.

21:58.303 --> 21:59.936
How does that work exactly?

21:59.938 --> 22:01.871
You'll get food,

22:01.873 --> 22:03.273
medical attention,

22:03.275 --> 22:05.308
whatever you may need.

22:05.310 --> 22:07.009
But for now, you're
confined to your quarters.

22:07.011 --> 22:09.246
- So we are prisoners.
- You're alive.

22:09.736 --> 22:12.950
And I didn't see a line of Martian
ships coming to save you.

22:12.951 --> 22:15.285
Hey, guys, I'm gonna... I'm
gonna stick around here,

22:15.287 --> 22:17.387
make sure our guests are comfortable.

22:17.389 --> 22:18.855
Copy that.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.126
How are they?

22:23.128 --> 22:24.494
You're welcome to go in.

22:24.496 --> 22:27.230
Might make them feel better
to see one of their own.

22:27.232 --> 22:30.166
I'm not sure they see me that way now.

22:30.168 --> 22:32.135
Mars has instead insisted

22:32.137 --> 22:34.504
on what it calls independence,

22:34.506 --> 22:37.140
which is actually no more
than a justification

22:37.142 --> 22:38.642
for war and violence.

22:38.644 --> 22:42.044
It looks upon this terrible
and miraculous moment,

22:42.046 --> 22:44.100
and they see it as an opportunity

22:44.110 --> 22:45.457
to revisit and...

22:45.458 --> 22:47.874
SORRENTO-GILLIS SPEECH
RESPONSE TO MARTIAN ATTACK

22:48.487 --> 22:52.021
That Belter girl made food. You hungry?

22:52.023 --> 22:53.456
- What?
- Food.

22:53.458 --> 22:56.159
You put it in that big hole in your face.

22:56.161 --> 22:58.328
I need to talk to Holden.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.632
Good talk.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.514
How sure are we the ship's
reactor isn't gonna blow up?

23:17.516 --> 23:18.748
Not very.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.850
The Martian rescue ships
will take a dim view

23:20.852 --> 23:22.485
of us helping ourselves to their stuff.

23:22.487 --> 23:25.054
Better to get moving
when no one's looking.

23:46.010 --> 23:48.044
There's nothing else here.

23:55.954 --> 23:58.254
Our engineer calls this stuff red kibble.

23:58.256 --> 24:00.323
Little bit spicy, but, damn...

24:00.325 --> 24:01.791
Belter food.

24:01.977 --> 24:03.893
Tell your captain we need
to get to a Martian ship

24:03.895 --> 24:05.628
as soon as possible.

24:05.630 --> 24:08.565
Yeah, well, that fight that
you all lost out here,

24:08.567 --> 24:10.933
that's going on all over
the system right now.

24:10.935 --> 24:13.069
Your best bet, ride it out with us,

24:13.071 --> 24:14.070
go home after.

24:14.072 --> 24:15.905
If Mars loses this war,

24:15.907 --> 24:17.474
there might not be a
home left to return to.

24:17.476 --> 24:19.242
Three more soldiers not
gonna change that.

24:21.946 --> 24:23.980
A ship might.

24:23.982 --> 24:26.249
Maybe we're not enough
to make a difference,

24:26.251 --> 24:27.684
but I'm not gonna hide out here

24:27.686 --> 24:30.152
while everyone I give a
shit about burns back home.

24:34.426 --> 24:36.192
At least those other two had the decency

24:36.194 --> 24:37.927
not to wear that uniform.

24:40.198 --> 24:41.981
Excuse me?

24:41.982 --> 24:43.600
I earned the right to wear this

24:43.602 --> 24:45.304
long before you were born, junior.

24:45.305 --> 24:47.103
Well...

24:47.105 --> 24:49.338
guess you're all done, then.

24:49.340 --> 24:51.274
The rest of us...

24:51.276 --> 24:53.009
our loyalty isn't on a clock.

24:53.011 --> 24:54.277
Look, I did my 20, son,

24:54.279 --> 24:56.613
am honorably discharged.
I'm a civilian now.

24:56.615 --> 24:57.885
We're at war!

24:59.651 --> 25:01.183
No one's a civilian now.

25:01.185 --> 25:02.519
Okay, all right, kids.

25:02.521 --> 25:04.353
Enough is enough, all right? Settle down.

25:04.355 --> 25:06.122
I said settle down.

25:16.247 --> 25:18.167
We're taking this ship.

25:20.459 --> 25:23.027
And you will get the fuck back to work.

25:23.029 --> 25:24.194
I need full access to the comms

25:24.196 --> 25:26.396
so I can send this out to
the people who can use it.

25:27.242 --> 25:29.438
No.

25:29.439 --> 25:30.568
I can stop what's happening.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.706
You can't stop anything with a broadcast

25:32.707 --> 25:33.942
except us breathing.

25:33.943 --> 25:37.312
Wideband broadcast would light
us up on everyone's threat board.

25:37.313 --> 25:40.412
We're too close to the
war zone to risk it.

25:40.413 --> 25:43.148
I just saw the UN Secretary-General

25:43.150 --> 25:45.250
address the General Assembly.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.518
The man's always been
a fucking bobblehead,

25:47.520 --> 25:49.654
but tonight I saw something else.

25:49.656 --> 25:52.423
I saw Deputy Errinwright
speaking through his mouth.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.860
And that man is not a fool.

25:54.862 --> 25:57.362
With him running this war,

25:57.364 --> 26:01.833
it won't end until Earth, Mars,
or both are smoking rubble.

26:01.835 --> 26:04.369
And you can fix that with a message?

26:04.371 --> 26:06.537
To the right person, yes.

26:06.539 --> 26:08.774
This is Anna Volovodov.

26:08.776 --> 26:12.510
Back in their protestor days,
she was his conscience.

26:12.512 --> 26:15.847
She wrote the speech that
created his political career.

26:15.849 --> 26:18.383
They share a lot of history.

26:18.385 --> 26:19.885
And she's no stooge of Errinwright.

26:19.887 --> 26:21.519
We said no!

26:21.521 --> 26:23.421
We're not sending any messages out.

26:23.423 --> 26:26.158
Why this Anna? Why not the SG himself?

26:26.160 --> 26:29.527
They'll be monitoring
all UN communications.

26:29.529 --> 26:30.662
But Anna is an outsider

26:30.664 --> 26:33.564
with direct access to Sorrento-Gillis.

26:33.566 --> 26:36.201
And Errinwright doesn't own her.

26:36.203 --> 26:37.435
Let me send her this message.

26:37.437 --> 26:39.615
If she brings it to the
Secretary-General,

26:39.616 --> 26:43.541
it'll show him who his deputy really is.

26:43.543 --> 26:46.444
The distance from Amazonia to Montana

26:46.446 --> 26:48.213
is less than what we have traveled

26:48.215 --> 26:51.283
since this conversation started.

26:51.285 --> 26:53.218
The longer this goes,

26:53.220 --> 26:54.652
the more bombs will fall.

26:58.458 --> 27:00.558
Please help me stop it.

27:05.732 --> 27:08.733
Find us a router to bounce
a tight-beam off of,

27:08.735 --> 27:11.636
something that can't
be traced back to us.

27:11.638 --> 27:15.406
We'll send it out as quietly as we can.

27:15.408 --> 27:18.310
Thank you for being the man
your mother knows you are.

27:27.687 --> 27:31.622
This is how it starts, you know.

27:31.624 --> 27:33.859
We're sending a message, nothing more.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.060
You can't trust her!

27:35.062 --> 27:36.361
And I can trust you?

27:38.531 --> 27:40.765
I understand what she is.

27:43.603 --> 27:45.803
I'm gonna help Amos with the supplies.

27:55.815 --> 27:57.782
How many people will be in ops?

27:57.784 --> 28:00.318
- I don't know.
- We'll make him go up first.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.856
Alex, can we take a look at the
drive balancing real quick?

28:06.994 --> 28:08.159
Sorry.

28:10.530 --> 28:12.830
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Good advice.

28:12.832 --> 28:14.465
The armory's down there.
Go get as many guns

28:14.467 --> 28:16.634
as you can carry, and get back up here.

28:16.636 --> 28:17.969
Tell the ship that we have access.

28:17.971 --> 28:20.036
I can't do that. The captain
has the key for that.

28:20.037 --> 28:22.573
Until we get it, just let me
know what you need me to do.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.226
There's no need to hurt anyone.

28:24.227 --> 28:25.510
Lay in a course for Callisto.

28:25.512 --> 28:27.635
Open up comms so I can notify the MCRN

28:27.636 --> 28:29.147
that we're gonna rendezvous with
the Jupiter fleet immediately.

28:29.149 --> 28:30.348
- Do it now.
- Okay.

28:30.615 --> 28:32.592
But I need to bring my people
over from the "Kittur"

28:32.593 --> 28:34.485
before I can do any maneuvers.

28:34.487 --> 28:35.553
Just let me call them and...

28:36.823 --> 28:37.989
The "KC" is flying with us?

28:37.991 --> 28:39.391
Yes.

28:39.393 --> 28:40.573
The drive was functional,

28:40.574 --> 28:43.117
and we wanted to get it away from the
debris field while we worked on it.

28:43.118 --> 28:44.868
Doesn't matter! It's junk! Cut it loose!

28:44.869 --> 28:47.332
I can't abandon two of my crew.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.600
I know you understand that.

28:49.602 --> 28:52.003
This is starting to feel a
little bit ungrateful...

29:01.514 --> 29:02.914
Ammo.

29:25.538 --> 29:27.505
Help!

29:45.420 --> 29:47.625
Sit.

29:47.627 --> 29:48.759
She wasn't kidding.

29:49.035 --> 29:50.622
You know, this ship is running on fumes.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.630
Let me call my people on the "Kittur."

29:52.632 --> 29:54.432
I can keep them in the
airlock if you're worried,

29:54.434 --> 29:56.001
but at least I can keep them safe there.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.768
Will it get us to Callisto?

29:57.770 --> 29:59.181
It'll be tight, but...

29:59.182 --> 30:01.029
OPS DECK
MASTER ALARM

30:01.808 --> 30:04.409
What the hell is that?

30:04.411 --> 30:07.412
Sino, go see if Ranhofer's okay.

30:07.414 --> 30:08.546
I think he's still alive.

30:11.084 --> 30:13.584
Didn't know where the ammo was.

30:13.586 --> 30:15.086
- Put it down!
- You first.

30:15.088 --> 30:16.454
Do what he says!

30:16.456 --> 30:17.489
I just sent out the master alarm,

30:17.491 --> 30:19.024
which means you have between now

30:19.026 --> 30:20.525
and whenever my mechanic gets back.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.626
You should believe him on that.

30:21.628 --> 30:24.095
Or maybe I should just shoot this guy.

30:24.097 --> 30:25.930
And then?

30:25.932 --> 30:27.999
There's a version of this
where nobody shoots anybody.

30:28.001 --> 30:30.001
Let's try for that one.

30:30.003 --> 30:31.636
Hey, fellas.

30:36.976 --> 30:38.643
So what's all the ruckus?

30:46.330 --> 30:47.902
WARNING
MASTER ALARM

30:48.402 --> 30:50.922
Stay right there, big girl.

30:50.923 --> 30:52.204
Okay, I'm gonna give you a pass

30:52.205 --> 30:53.669
because you're young and stupid,

30:53.670 --> 30:54.636
but keep pointing that thing at me,

30:54.637 --> 30:56.349
and I'm gonna take it away from you.

30:56.350 --> 30:57.097
You think you can?

30:57.098 --> 30:58.471
That's recon gear, Lofty.

30:58.472 --> 31:00.266
Like she could force-feed you
that gun if she wanted to.

31:00.267 --> 31:02.077
I'd prefer it didn't come to that.

31:02.079 --> 31:03.377
The fact that I didn't
shoot you in the head

31:03.379 --> 31:05.343
should prove to you we'd
rather not kill you.

31:05.644 --> 31:08.416
We? Is that right?

31:08.418 --> 31:09.751
Another Martian wearing the uniform

31:09.753 --> 31:11.086
but playing for the other side?

31:11.088 --> 31:12.707
Shut up! Are you trying to get us killed?

31:12.708 --> 31:13.955
Not sure how else this goes!

31:15.592 --> 31:17.425
Okay, I get it.

31:17.427 --> 31:18.927
I do.

31:19.141 --> 31:20.340
All your friends are dead,

31:20.342 --> 31:21.541
and this feels like a way to honor them.

31:21.543 --> 31:23.009
It feels like you're doing your duty.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.478
- I want...
- You want to fight the enemy.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.647
I know.

31:27.649 --> 31:28.581
But I learned a while back

31:28.583 --> 31:29.582
that the hardest part of this game

31:29.584 --> 31:32.885
is figuring out who the enemy really is.

31:34.089 --> 31:35.956
And these guys aren't it.

31:35.958 --> 31:38.325
Look, we tried, okay?

31:38.327 --> 31:41.161
This shit, it didn't work.

31:41.163 --> 31:42.929
I don't want to die here.

31:42.931 --> 31:44.030
So what, then?

31:44.032 --> 31:46.333
Put the gun down and live to find out.

31:50.672 --> 31:52.839
We'll find another way.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.220
Shit, did I miss it?

32:12.197 --> 32:13.660
The calls are coming in from everywhere.

32:14.556 --> 32:17.027
By tomorrow, the polls will confirm
what we already know,

32:17.028 --> 32:20.200
that you have overwhelming
public support.

32:20.202 --> 32:22.935
Esteban.

32:22.937 --> 32:24.770
- What the hell was that?
- Anna.

32:24.772 --> 32:26.873
No, you twisted my words.

32:26.875 --> 32:30.372
You made me part of everything
that I hate about all of this!

32:30.373 --> 32:31.144
Now, that's not fair.

32:31.146 --> 32:32.945
I can't believe I fell for this again!

32:32.947 --> 32:34.881
I am such an idiot.

32:34.883 --> 32:36.916
You snapped your fingers,
and I am right back

32:36.918 --> 32:39.085
to following you around,
mopping up the blood.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.420
What the world needs right
now is precisely...

32:40.422 --> 32:42.134
You don't get to speak to me!

32:42.135 --> 32:42.955
Not ever again.

32:42.957 --> 32:45.325
And you didn't need to
be his hand puppet.

32:45.327 --> 32:47.227
You could've been better than this.

32:47.229 --> 32:50.397
You should have been more than this.

32:50.399 --> 32:52.932
I used to believe that
there was a decent man

32:52.934 --> 32:56.736
somewhere inside you buried
under all that ambition.

32:56.738 --> 32:58.271
I'm sorry I was so wrong.

33:14.122 --> 33:16.756
That's as much water as we can spare.

33:16.758 --> 33:18.458
Is it enough?

33:18.460 --> 33:19.792
Yeah.

33:19.794 --> 33:21.994
That plus the CO tanks we
gave them should be enough

33:21.996 --> 33:24.064
to get them back to their fleet.

33:26.768 --> 33:27.733
It's nice to be working

33:27.735 --> 33:29.802
on something that's easy to repair.

33:31.506 --> 33:33.173
Yeah.

33:34.909 --> 33:37.977
Some things don't get fixed.

33:47.289 --> 33:49.456
I feel like I'm awaiting sentencing.

33:49.458 --> 33:51.891
There's someone I need you to meet.

33:51.893 --> 33:52.992
Why me?

33:52.994 --> 33:54.827
Your friend with the
gun hurt my feelings.

33:54.829 --> 33:57.097
You seemed to be the most reasonable.

34:02.070 --> 34:03.803
You're Chrisjen Avasarala.

34:03.805 --> 34:04.804
Yes.

34:04.806 --> 34:06.872
The UN Deputy Undersecretary.

34:06.874 --> 34:08.908
This is going to be very tedious

34:08.909 --> 34:11.143
if you remain this dim.

34:11.146 --> 34:12.245
I don't understand.

34:12.246 --> 34:13.480
What the hell kind of a ship is this?

34:13.482 --> 34:16.882
Right, the tedious version, then.

34:18.487 --> 34:20.553
This war is a lie

34:20.554 --> 34:23.322
started by people in my own government,

34:23.324 --> 34:25.992
though Mars is not without some blame.

34:25.994 --> 34:27.092
Why... why are you telling me this?

34:27.094 --> 34:30.330
The only way it can be
stopped is out here,

34:30.331 --> 34:32.297
away from the politicians.

34:33.335 --> 34:35.335
Yes, I am aware of the irony.

34:35.337 --> 34:37.516
This is why I left.

34:37.518 --> 34:40.106
I needed to find the real enemy
before I could fight them.

34:40.108 --> 34:42.175
It's the only way I can do my duty...

34:42.177 --> 34:45.110
my true duty... to Mars.

34:45.112 --> 34:47.947
Okay. Great.

34:47.949 --> 34:49.581
What exactly is it
you're asking me to do?

34:49.583 --> 34:51.451
When you rejoin your fleet,

34:51.453 --> 34:53.286
I have something I want you to show

34:53.288 --> 34:55.087
to your commanding officer.

34:55.089 --> 34:56.523
Tell him it came from me.

34:56.525 --> 35:01.027
Ask him to pass this along
to Admiral Souther.

35:01.029 --> 35:02.094
A UNN Admiral.

35:02.096 --> 35:05.131
He is with the 3rd Fleet around Jupiter,

35:05.133 --> 35:07.066
where you're headed, I believe.

35:07.068 --> 35:09.101
Wait, so you're letting
me rejoin my fleet?

35:09.103 --> 35:10.370
We're giving you the "KC."

35:10.372 --> 35:11.604
It can already fly.

35:11.606 --> 35:13.540
Our people are getting
it livable again...

35:13.542 --> 35:15.608
or, you know, more livable.

35:18.146 --> 35:22.081
Okay, so you want me to go back

35:22.083 --> 35:25.218
and tell my CO to hail a UNN admiral

35:25.220 --> 35:26.386
in the middle of a war?

35:26.388 --> 35:29.055
Yes, exactly.

35:29.057 --> 35:31.558
Or Holden here can space the three of you

35:31.560 --> 35:34.227
for being such intolerable idiots.

35:34.229 --> 35:36.095
Honestly, I can go either way.

35:36.097 --> 35:38.264
I'd rather do the first one.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.966
So far, all you've done
is wound Alex's pride,

35:40.968 --> 35:42.134
which is nothing we can't forgive

35:42.136 --> 35:43.936
if you're willing to help us.

35:49.911 --> 35:52.011
So what is this thing that
you want me to show them?

35:56.984 --> 35:59.184
Time is short, and I'll be brief.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.591
I'm more angry at myself
than I am at him.

36:02.592 --> 36:06.166
I knew he was a lying pile of
feces before I agreed to come.

36:06.167 --> 36:08.667
Language. Your daughter's
in the next room.

36:08.669 --> 36:10.469
Feces was as nice as I can...

36:10.471 --> 36:12.821
And sleeping, so volume too.

36:12.822 --> 36:14.289
You turn yours down,

36:14.291 --> 36:15.623
'cause I'm probably gonna yell some more.

36:15.625 --> 36:17.858
You're upset, but I need
you to keep it together,

36:17.860 --> 36:19.194
because I barely am.

36:19.196 --> 36:20.975
Namonisko, I'm sorry.

36:21.666 --> 36:23.064
I'm so wrapped up in my own head,

36:23.066 --> 36:24.625
I haven't even asked
you how you're doing.

36:24.626 --> 36:26.584
- Things at the clinic are going well.
- Okay.

36:26.585 --> 36:29.037
The young man the bishop sent
over to handle Sunday worship

36:29.038 --> 36:31.806
isn't being booed off the podium.

36:31.808 --> 36:35.042
And millions of people
just died in the Amazon,

36:35.044 --> 36:37.378
so of course nothing is really okay.

36:37.380 --> 36:39.334
And Nami's too young to understand,

36:39.335 --> 36:40.824
but she can tell that I'm scared.

36:40.825 --> 36:43.510
I don't want her to know this...
that the world can be this bad,

36:43.511 --> 36:45.086
that I can't fix it for her.

36:45.088 --> 36:47.755
I'm coming home right now.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.325
I'm glad,

36:50.326 --> 36:52.940
if that's the best thing you
can be doing right now.

36:52.941 --> 36:55.330
Don't do it for me.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I have no...

36:59.002 --> 37:02.103
I have no idea what the
best thing is anymore.

37:02.105 --> 37:03.271
Hey, hey, my love...

37:03.273 --> 37:05.206
I-I haven't changed...

37:06.409 --> 37:07.842
Anything!

37:07.844 --> 37:09.277
I just made it worse.

37:09.279 --> 37:10.845
That can't be true.

37:10.847 --> 37:12.447
You know, if I needed to be humbled,

37:12.449 --> 37:14.282
wouldn't having all my hair fall out

37:14.284 --> 37:16.351
have done it? This...

37:16.353 --> 37:18.253
This feels like overkill.

37:18.255 --> 37:19.687
Believing that God is humbling you

37:19.689 --> 37:24.578
using a solar system-wide war
feels ironic, at the very least.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.096
Okay, I love you. I'm...

37:29.098 --> 37:30.431
I am coming home.

37:30.433 --> 37:33.934
You are the only thing

37:33.936 --> 37:35.370
that I know I'm doing right,

37:35.372 --> 37:38.206
and I need that right now.

37:38.208 --> 37:39.907
We need you too.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.442
We love you. Come home.

37:41.444 --> 37:43.878
I am on my way.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.613
I love you.

37:58.298 --> 38:00.254
DR. VOLOVODOV, I TRUST YOU WILL
KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS

38:05.349 --> 38:07.435
Time is short, and I'll be brief.

38:07.437 --> 38:09.404
Martian Defense Minister Korshunov

38:09.406 --> 38:11.939
suffered a fatal heart
attack earlier this evening.

38:11.941 --> 38:15.176
Simultaneously, the MCRN "Karakum,"

38:15.178 --> 38:17.445
dispatched by Korshunov to take delivery

38:17.447 --> 38:19.314
of your protomolecule technology,

38:19.316 --> 38:22.350
was destroyed over Ganymede.

38:22.352 --> 38:24.507
And I gave the order.

38:24.508 --> 38:26.754
And I can give the same
order to end your life.

38:41.538 --> 38:43.638
Hey.

38:44.729 --> 38:48.134
I just wanted to say thanks for
having my back in there, Gunny.

38:48.135 --> 38:49.402
Well, all of our backs, actually.

38:49.403 --> 38:51.512
I mean, that situation
could've gone way south

38:51.514 --> 38:52.880
if you hadn't shown up when you did.

38:55.017 --> 38:57.518
Couldn't let them kill the
only decent cook on this tub.

38:58.555 --> 39:01.683
I don't know. I thought Naomi's
kibble stuff was very interesting.

39:02.359 --> 39:04.492
Belter food.

39:04.494 --> 39:07.495
Hey, best be careful saying
that on this ship, Marine,

39:07.497 --> 39:11.198
'cause Naomi may be
small, but she's tough.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.433
I know those Martians were idiots,

39:12.435 --> 39:14.502
but I hope we didn't just
kill those three kids.

39:14.504 --> 39:15.836
Oh, no, Naomi knows her shit.

39:15.838 --> 39:18.287
She says that boat's safe, it's safe.

39:18.288 --> 39:19.456
And we didn't lie to them.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.510
We just cut them loose 'cause we
thought they could save some lives.

39:21.511 --> 39:23.043
No other reason.

39:23.045 --> 39:24.679
I just hope they can do their part.

39:26.812 --> 39:27.698
Hey, Sailor.

39:28.982 --> 39:31.085
Let's wage a war on that gut.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.460
You just can't help yourself, can you?

39:42.465 --> 39:44.332
Saving everyone.

39:45.268 --> 39:48.035
You just can't stop yourself.

39:52.041 --> 39:53.675
Thank you.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.114
I'm glad you're okay.

40:15.632 --> 40:16.931
- That seems right.
- I want to see him.

40:16.933 --> 40:19.066
- The answer is no.
- Just for a little bit.

40:19.068 --> 40:20.768
- No, Mei!
- Can I see Katoa?

40:20.770 --> 40:22.303
No!

40:22.305 --> 40:24.071
Please?

40:24.073 --> 40:25.206
I already said no!

40:25.208 --> 40:26.998
- I need to!
- You cannot see him!

40:26.999 --> 40:28.343
You're mean.

40:30.808 --> 40:31.625
I know you two...

40:31.626 --> 40:34.048
I'll handle this. I know the type.

40:34.050 --> 40:37.518
Now, what's going on
here, my little friend?

40:37.520 --> 40:38.864
I want to see Katoa.

40:38.865 --> 40:40.421
I haven't seen him for a while.

40:40.423 --> 40:42.256
He got sick. Is he okay?

40:42.258 --> 40:43.842
I'll have to ask Dr. Strickland.

40:43.843 --> 40:45.793
I want to go home. I
want to see my daddy.

40:45.795 --> 40:47.762
Well, you're not well enough to travel.

40:47.764 --> 40:49.129
Can I talk to my dad?

40:49.131 --> 40:50.926
That's not possible,

40:50.927 --> 40:51.947
because of the war.

40:51.948 --> 40:53.534
I want to talk to Katoa.

40:53.536 --> 40:54.956
If he's going home,

40:54.957 --> 40:56.478
he can say hi to my dad for me.

40:56.479 --> 40:59.240
I'll have to ask Dr. Strickland.

41:05.214 --> 41:06.647
I'll get her.

41:26.409 --> 41:28.235
Now.

41:28.237 --> 41:30.304
Everything's fine.

41:30.306 --> 41:31.506
I have you.

41:31.508 --> 41:33.307
I want to see Katoa.

41:33.309 --> 41:35.242
Katoa's in here.

41:35.244 --> 41:36.811
Why do you say that?

41:36.813 --> 41:38.813
I saw his nurse go in there.

41:47.857 --> 41:49.824
Bring Strickland to me, now.

41:49.826 --> 41:52.660
Katoa! It's me, Mei!

41:52.662 --> 41:54.261
Katoa!

42:02.338 --> 42:04.138
Open it.

42:04.139 --> 42:05.307
Now.

42:08.177 --> 42:09.922
Sir, we were so close.

42:09.923 --> 42:12.447
I couldn't in good
conscience abandon the test

42:12.449 --> 42:15.182
when we were so far along.

42:15.184 --> 42:17.305
Human trials are essential.

42:21.190 --> 42:23.190
Bandwidth and distance irrelevant.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.526
Limitations require input redundancy.

42:25.832 --> 42:26.958
Take her.

42:32.201 --> 42:35.636
Dr. Strickland?

42:35.970 --> 42:36.971
I'm sorry.

42:37.713 --> 42:38.906
I feel so weird.

42:40.919 --> 42:44.211
My hands...

42:44.213 --> 42:46.213
I didn't mean to.

42:46.215 --> 42:48.415
I...

42:48.651 --> 42:50.865
Inherent to repurposing.

42:50.866 --> 42:53.721
Disassembly reveals useful pathways.

43:04.834 --> 43:07.267
It's all connected.

43:07.587 --> 43:08.803
The boy is talking

43:08.805 --> 43:11.438
to the rest of the
protomolecule infestations.

43:13.394 --> 43:15.910
You were right to continue.

43:16.343 --> 43:17.945
He's the key to everything.
