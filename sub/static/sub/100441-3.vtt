WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:19.352
-Guys, you gotta come see this!

00:19.436 --> 00:20.812
Follow me!

00:34.534 --> 00:35.910
Welcome to my head.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.207
Am I just super high?

00:44.002 --> 00:47.047
-This is seriously amazing.
- Yeah!

00:47.338 --> 00:50.050
This is awesome!

00:50.133 --> 00:51.551
- Who's that?
- Yeah!

00:52.886 --> 00:53.845
Whoo!

00:54.512 --> 00:55.764
My glee.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.641
Feelings can become living things here,
too.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.393
How do you know that?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.479
It's my head. I just do.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.898
Okay...

01:05.440 --> 01:06.441
So trippy.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.954
There we go.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.333
Orion's Belt complete.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.544
What is this?

01:27.545 --> 01:29.589
We're inside one of my memories.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.424
Dad!

01:34.135 --> 01:35.386
He can't hear you.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.013
I already tried.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.182
You too tired for a story tonight, buddy?

01:39.265 --> 01:40.892
-Never.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.270
What do you say
we give <i>Peter Pan</i> a break...

01:44.521 --> 01:48.817
and I tell you a Rendell Locke original?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.987
I don't know...

01:53.279 --> 01:54.656
Yeah...

01:54.739 --> 01:58.743
maybe you're not ready for the one
with the sea monster, it's too scary.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.204
-Sea monster?
- Yeah,

02:01.287 --> 02:03.873
see, there was this very old fisherman

02:03.998 --> 02:06.793
and he's sailing the ocean
with his trusted shipmates...

02:09.337 --> 02:10.880
Well...

02:11.631 --> 02:16.177
one day, they find themselves
in the middle of this huge storm,

02:16.261 --> 02:20.431
and they got so turned around
that they ended up on a remote island

02:21.099 --> 02:22.350
that wasn't on any map.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.230
As they explored around
looking for food and shelter,

02:27.814 --> 02:30.859
they come across a chest
buried in the sand.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.321
When they opened the chest,
they discovered

02:36.072 --> 02:38.241
it was full of gold.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.494
I thought you said
there was a sea monster.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.080
Oh, I'm getting there.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.332
I think I remember this one.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.168
They decided to take it
with them,

02:48.251 --> 02:51.296
but while they were trying to drag
the chest back to their ship,

02:51.379 --> 02:53.965
they were suddenly attacked

02:54.048 --> 02:57.510
by a vicious sea monster.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.762
And the sea monster

02:59.846 --> 03:03.433
chewed up their whole ship
so they couldn't escape.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.061
It was its job to protect the treasure
and make sure--

03:08.104 --> 03:10.481
- What happened?

03:12.817 --> 03:15.278
I think I fell asleep before Dad finished.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.821
I never heard how it ends.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.325
It's probably for the best.
That story got dark.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.495
What are you talking about?
It had a happy ending.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.997
If you say so.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.790
I remember so.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.696
-How is any of this possible?
- I told you,

03:58.780 --> 04:00.073
it's the keys.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.366
How are you even finding them?

04:01.449 --> 04:02.784
I hear them whisper.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.202
Whisper.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.161
What are they saying?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.580
Not really words.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.166
At least none that I understand.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.919
I just focus real hard
and it leads me to them.

04:13.002 --> 04:16.130
Dad must've known about the keys.
There was one in the bracelet he gave me.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.174
I wonder if there are any more.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.760
-Okay, Tyler's turn.
- No.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.637
No way. No one is poking around

04:22.720 --> 04:23.846
-in my head.
- Come on.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.391
-Kinsey, come on!
-Same. Nuh-uh.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.601
Please?

04:28.893 --> 04:30.812
What's the point of having magic keys

04:30.895 --> 04:32.146
-if we can't even use them?
-Shh.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.064
Hey--

04:33.147 --> 04:37.235
Until we know how much damage they can do,
I'm gonna hold on to both of them.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.445
-What?
-Why do you get both?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.364
You already have the one
with the two faces.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.573
The Mirror Key.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.409
Obviously, I'm the... the oldest so...

04:44.492 --> 04:45.785
And the least responsible.

04:45.868 --> 04:46.911
Hello?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.122
I'm the one who's finding them all.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.581
You already lost one.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.250
That wasn't my fault.

04:55.753 --> 04:59.048
-Okay, I didn't tell you this before,

04:59.674 --> 05:01.467
but there's this scary well lady

05:01.551 --> 05:03.553
who's trying to get the keys.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.430
So I need to protect them.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.223
And so we should give them to you?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.225
Exactly!

05:09.392 --> 05:10.393
I don't think so.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.562
Okay, look, here's what we're gonna do:

05:12.687 --> 05:16.858
Tyler's gonna take the Mirror Key,
and I'll take the... brainy key.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.110
Head. Key.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.862
Sure, we'll go with that.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.697
-She is real.
- If she comes back,

05:22.780 --> 05:24.365
you tell us right away. Okay?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.076
What if it's too late?

05:32.957 --> 05:35.168

06:41.984 --> 06:43.861
- That sounds crazy.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.071
Somebody's in there.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.865
It's probably just some sad hobo.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.284
Hey, lady!

06:51.244 --> 06:53.287
-Where'd you come from?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.373
Where'd you get that key?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.835
-Don't worry about it.
-Were there any others?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.129
Perhaps one in the shape of a head?

07:01.712 --> 07:03.214
No. Why?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.302
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.523
What does yours do?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.984
It's... like a lighter.

07:23.901 --> 07:24.735
Cool.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.237
You said you'd show me yours.

07:27.113 --> 07:27.947
Okay.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.532
If you insist.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.376
Whoa.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.502
What the hell?

07:41.586 --> 07:42.628
- Hey!

07:50.470 --> 07:52.513
Does anybody else want to see?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.348
- Go. Go!

08:04.567 --> 08:05.401
Hey!

08:05.485 --> 08:06.736
How's it going?

08:07.737 --> 08:11.073
Me and the droogs wanted to thank you
for all your hard work yesterday.

08:11.741 --> 08:12.617
So,

08:13.743 --> 08:14.619
<i>voilà.</i>

08:15.286 --> 08:16.120
Excuse me.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.333
-Oh, my God! Band of Horses tickets?
-Yeah,

08:20.416 --> 08:21.834
well, no. Not exactly.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.129
It's a local Band of Horses cover band.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.298
Cover Band of Horses.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.384
Yeah, Matheson isn't exactly
a hotbed of culture.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.637
But we do actually get
some pretty good cover bands.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.349
You know, we've got Novembress,
Death Lift for Cutie, Nerdvana.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.477
You know, it's a...
it's a nearish approximation

08:39.560 --> 08:41.771
of having
a formative concert-going experience.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.358
You sure Zadie and Doug
aren't still pissed at me

08:45.441 --> 08:46.776
for botching their blood gag?

08:46.984 --> 08:51.072
Actually, this wouldn't technically be
a designated Savini Squad outing.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.034
-Two tickets.
-Yeah, just...

08:56.577 --> 08:57.662
you and I.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.790
Oh... So this is a date?

09:01.249 --> 09:03.543
Yeah, well, I mean-- God, not a date.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.212
Not that word, that's...
that word's so antiquated.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.797
You know, pedestrian even.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.466
No, I would never deign
to make anybody feel obligated

09:10.550 --> 09:12.134
to the social constructs
that exist under...

09:12.593 --> 09:14.262
a dating umbrella.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.639
No, why don't we just call it a...

09:16.722 --> 09:17.557
a hang?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.226
-Hang?
-Hang.  Yeah.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.520
So, Saturday?

09:23.104 --> 09:26.649
I have a paper due
and this summer program application--

09:26.732 --> 09:28.985
Okay, well, no... no pressure.
I'll just...

09:29.110 --> 09:30.027
-swoop!

09:30.111 --> 09:31.237
I'll hold on to these

09:31.487 --> 09:33.239
and if you want to join me,

09:33.614 --> 09:36.534
great, but if it's a no,
you know, I'm a big boy.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.702
I can take it.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.036
It's a maybe.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.162
Maybe?

09:40.913 --> 09:42.540
Maybe's good. Maybe's...

09:42.623 --> 09:43.874
I'll take maybe.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.002
Just, uh, let me know.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.004
Rocky Road.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.768
You don't have to sit with us.
Go ahead. Sit with your friends.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.562
That assumes I have any.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.480
So make some.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.899
-Bode.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.029
-Nina!
-Hey!

10:13.112 --> 10:15.489
Hi! So good to see you out here!

10:15.573 --> 10:17.283
My son Tyler just joined the team.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.200
Bode,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.453
this is Ellie, Rufus' mom.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.623
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Bode.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.042
Rufus told me
all about his fellow soldier.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.835
-Bud, you wanna go find us some seats?
-Okay.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.503
- Okay.
-Bye, Ellie.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.421
-Bye.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.006
- Right! Right!

10:32.381 --> 10:35.009
-So how's the renovation coming along?

10:35.593 --> 10:38.137
Oh, you know, fix one problem,
eight more pop up.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.973
Well, if you ever want
to get out of the house,

10:41.057 --> 10:43.559
I've been wanting to check out
this new Italian place downtown?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.353
Ooh... Do they have a kids' menu?

10:45.853 --> 10:46.854
Probably not.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.356
-Sounds perfect!

10:50.524 --> 10:52.860
Jackie, I mean he's clearly into you,

10:52.943 --> 10:55.613
maybe he just wanted to make you jealous
or something? I don't know.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.866
It's just like a really weird situation.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.701
Can we just watch the game?

11:00.951 --> 11:04.080
Who comes to these things
to just watch the game?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.753
I didn't realize
that we had a little audience.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.797
- Come on, pressure!
-It's Kinsey, right?

11:13.714 --> 11:14.674
Pick it up!

11:15.341 --> 11:16.342
Come sit with us.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.181
- Get him!

11:28.479 --> 11:29.355
Let's go!

11:30.898 --> 11:33.025
I don't know
why I even bothered lacing up.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.529
Relax. I've seen you at practice
and you're good but you're also new,

11:36.612 --> 11:39.115
and the coach is pretty loyal to his guys.
You'll get your chance.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.244
Brutal.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.371
Yeah, that's Chad Garland.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.747
All-star dickwad.

11:51.085 --> 11:51.919
Yeah.

11:52.795 --> 11:53.796
Close game.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.548
-We lost by six.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.049
Still, good effort.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.759
For what? Cheering from the bench?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.845
-Hey, Ty, it was just the first game.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.555
You'll get more time the next game.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.849
-I'm gonna... I'm gonna go to Javi's.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.183
See ya at home.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.565
- Cool, I'll see you guys there.
-Jackie?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.234
Uh...

12:15.735 --> 12:17.445
You going to this thing at Javi's?

12:18.028 --> 12:18.988
Yeah.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.489
Um...

12:21.115 --> 12:21.991
You want a ride?

12:22.366 --> 12:23.242
Sure.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.370
-Oh, shit.
-What?

12:27.413 --> 12:30.416
That douchey guy was trying to get me
and Eden to go to a party tonight.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.669
I don't actually have anything
because I just moved here, so...

12:33.961 --> 12:36.338
I think you should really let me
show you around town.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.423
You okay?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.468
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just get out of here.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.219
Who is this? Your boyfriend?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.638
-Her brother.
-You need to relax.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.724
I mean, we're just having a conversation.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.852
Is that how all your conversations go:
you talk and she tries to flee?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
Maybe you should sit this one out.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.440
Like you did most of the game.

12:55.733 --> 12:56.567
Tyler.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.028
-Tyler!

13:01.447 --> 13:02.281
Fight!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.575
- Tyler, stop! Get off him!

13:12.041 --> 13:14.251
-Feels good, doesn't it?

13:14.335 --> 13:16.295
- Hey! Break it up.
- Get off him!

13:18.047 --> 13:20.049
Come on. Come on. Walk away.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.180
Well, the other player swung first.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.141
But there's no question,
Tyler went too far.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.560
I'll speak to Coach Riggs.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.522
Probably looking at a few weeks suspension
from the team.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.108
Tyler's just been so off.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.487
Down on himself,
defensive.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.571
It's understandable,

13:43.030 --> 13:44.406
with everything he's been through.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.408
You know, I wish I could just...

13:46.700 --> 13:48.702
jump us a year into the future.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.913
Get us past all the tough parts.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.874
Well, you'd miss out
on some pretty great parts, too.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.960
Yeah, that's true.

13:59.797 --> 14:00.631
Hey.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.758
You waiting on your dad?

14:03.676 --> 14:04.552
Mm-hmm.

14:05.594 --> 14:06.595
What did you do?

14:07.221 --> 14:09.181
I got home late
from a hockey party last night,

14:09.890 --> 14:12.393
I broke my curfew by 15 whole minutes.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.310
Bummer.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.522
Yeah. Dad's gonna... He's gonna give me
a whole lecture about it, so...

14:16.605 --> 14:19.024
-You two have been fighting a lot lately.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.360
I can never just make a mistake.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.780
You know, it's like every little thing
becomes a moral lesson.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.617
Kinsey's perfect,
but I can't catch a break.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.286
I feel you.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.039
Can't tell you how many times I wake up
thinking I gotta kill my dad today.

14:35.916 --> 14:36.792
Well...

14:37.418 --> 14:39.420
you ever do decide to kill your dad,

14:39.670 --> 14:41.630
do me a favor:
kill mine while you're at it.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.392
Yo!

14:54.643 --> 14:57.229
Hell of a fight there, Mayweather.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.107
That asshole was creeping on my sister,
so you can...

15:01.317 --> 15:02.776
you can spare me the lecture.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.028
Hey, no lecture.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.532
Look, um... I may not know what it's like
to lose somebody like you did.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.660
But I know a ton about anger, man.
I've been there.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.121
That shit will destroy you if you let it.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.415
So, uh... don't.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.752
What's with the shorts?

15:20.461 --> 15:21.712
My legs look cold to you?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.007
Come on, man.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.686
<i>♪ That's not what I meant to say at all ♪</i>

15:40.522 --> 15:43.192

15:43.275 --> 15:45.778

15:54.286 --> 15:58.874
<i>♪ I mean, I'm sick of it</i>
<i>And I just wanna hold you ♪</i>

16:29.780 --> 16:31.407
Enjoying your punishment chores?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.494
This is just... This is just how I like
to spend my Saturdays now.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.457
I'm sorry about last night. I...

16:41.583 --> 16:43.210
I didn't mean to push you or--

16:43.293 --> 16:44.378
That wasn't even you.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.590
I saw the look in your eyes, Tyler.
You went somewhere else.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.718
-It was scary.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.470
Come on. How can you even say that? I--

16:53.554 --> 16:55.055
I don't want to talk about it.

16:56.974 --> 16:57.808
Listen,

16:57.891 --> 16:59.351
I've thought about this a lot.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.441
And I've decided
I want to go inside my head.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.860
-Sure that's a good idea?
-No.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.070
But I have to know what it's like.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.781
It... freaks me out, but...

17:14.283 --> 17:16.660
but I think
that's exactly why I need to try it.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.328
By yourself?

17:19.705 --> 17:20.539
Yeah.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.834
I don't think so.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.172
I'm coming with you.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.012
Don't wander, don't touch anything,
don't take anything.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.264
It's my head, I'll know. Got it?

17:37.347 --> 17:38.182
Sure.

17:39.850 --> 17:40.726
Yes.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.073
Holy shit.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.916
Here goes.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.729
Bode got an arcade
and I get a weird ass mall?

18:51.338 --> 18:53.340
They're like memory stores.

18:54.007 --> 18:57.469
"Summer camp, birthdays, sleepovers.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.596
Best dance moves"?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.057
Wow.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.392
So organized.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.103
Even your head is a control freak.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.813
Here.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.567
That's where I want to go.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.499
What is it?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.043
The first time Dad took me
to the top of the Space Needle.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.879
-Wanna see?
-I'm good.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.650
They ran to their ship,

19:53.734 --> 19:56.320
and the fisherman boarded first
with the treasure in tow,

19:56.403 --> 19:57.613
but his friends...

19:58.280 --> 20:00.824
-they didn't make it in time.

20:00.991 --> 20:06.038
A sea monster attacked them
while the ship just sailed away.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.081
His friends all got swallowed?

20:08.415 --> 20:09.249
That's right.

20:09.666 --> 20:13.212
And the fisherman felt so guilty.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.549
So instead of keeping the treasure
all for himself,

20:18.091 --> 20:20.093
he decided to give it to their families.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.971
- That was nice.
-Until one day,

20:23.055 --> 20:27.100
when the sea monster returned
for his treasure...

20:27.184 --> 20:28.477
-Oh no...
-Yeah...

20:28.560 --> 20:29.394
but...

20:30.312 --> 20:32.898
it saw what the fisherman had done,

20:33.774 --> 20:36.026
how many people he had helped,

20:36.526 --> 20:38.654
and it coughed up all his friends.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.740
Incredibly, they were still alive.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.785
And they were all reunited,

20:45.410 --> 20:47.162
right there on the shore.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.959
Super dark ending, huh?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.002
That's not how I remember it.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.588
Goodnight, sweetie.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.131
-Night, Mom.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.883
That's Bode.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.095
You want one more story?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.056
Okay, pumpkin.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.434
-Goodnight, Daddy.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.901
I should've asked for one more.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.407
-You asleep?
- Not yet.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.200
You forgot Sally in my room.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.785
I know she helps you sleep.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.078
Thanks, Tyler.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.710
What just happened?

21:35.669 --> 21:36.962
I don't know, I was...

21:37.254 --> 21:39.423
thinking about you and we jumped memories.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.300
You can control it?

21:41.383 --> 21:43.260
Can you control what you're thinking?

21:48.724 --> 21:50.309
-Let's get out of here.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.689
I didn't hit him that hard.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.316
-In my mind you did.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.276
Who's that?

22:01.778 --> 22:03.572
It kind of looks a little like...

22:04.406 --> 22:05.240
Me.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.920
Where'd it go?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.298
I don't know.
Let's get outta here.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.553
Now where are we?

22:29.431 --> 22:30.682
We're back in Seattle.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.559
How do you know?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.271
Kinsey?

22:39.232 --> 22:40.525
Kinsey!

22:42.110 --> 22:43.111
Holy shit.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.405
I was hoping your dad
would answer some questions,

22:45.489 --> 22:46.907
but he wasn't any help.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.493
Will you help me, Kinsey?

22:54.456 --> 22:55.374
Must've been so scared.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.086
I saw that fireplace poker.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.089
I could've grabbed it

23:02.172 --> 23:03.256
when Sam's back was turned.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.341
I could've hit him.

23:06.676 --> 23:07.636
Kinsey.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.848
-Mom... Mom came in. She stopped him--
-But what if she hadn't?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.435
I hid like a coward.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.897
I was paralyzed.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.568
-We all have regrets about that day.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.696
Tyler!

23:51.888 --> 23:53.056
Are you okay?

23:54.474 --> 23:55.350
Yeah.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.366
What the hell was that thing?

24:12.325 --> 24:13.160
My fear.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.371
-It's like Bode said, I just know it.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.750
- Oh, my God.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.545
-You're hurt, even out here.
-Wait.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.714
Why did you make it attack me?

24:25.797 --> 24:27.132
I didn't!

24:27.257 --> 24:29.176
It was in your head, Kinsey.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.554
I'm sorry. Let me get some ice.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.140
No, I'm fine. Just... Just let it go.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.316
He let him live so he could spend
the rest of his days on the island.

25:28.026 --> 25:28.860
Alone.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.239
Never forgetting what had happened.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.574
What he'd done.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.954
All the pain he'd caused.

25:46.127 --> 25:48.129
The past is always with us, Tyler.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.758
Now, you can try and run away...

25:52.467 --> 25:53.301
but...

25:55.470 --> 25:57.138
it's always there.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.653
And I'll have a Malbec.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.614
-Or... Should we just share a bottle?

26:14.698 --> 26:16.950
I'm good with water. Thanks.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.829
So, I should, um...

26:22.872 --> 26:24.124
I'm actually sober.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.712
And I got you that bottle of gin
for your housewarming, like an idiot.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.298
It's always good to have something
for guests.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.341
Do you wanna just go get some coffee?

26:33.425 --> 26:34.718
No, no. This place is great.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.804
It doesn't bother me.
People drinking around me.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.848
How long's it been?

26:42.601 --> 26:43.977
Six years this April.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.355
Congrats. It's not easy.

26:47.981 --> 26:48.982
The worst part is...

26:50.984 --> 26:53.862
all the time I missed out on with my kids.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.114
Which you're getting to make up for now.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.742
How are they doing with the move?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.995
They're coping in their own ways.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.706
Kinsey's really anxious.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.291
She overthinks everything.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.127
Tyler hides out in his headphones.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.046
Bode's just this tornado of energy

27:11.129 --> 27:12.297
when he's not hanging out

27:12.380 --> 27:14.883
with his scary imaginary friend
in the well house.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.509
The well house?

27:16.593 --> 27:20.347
Yeah, he definitely inherited
his father's overactive imagination.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.562
To new friends.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.230
-Cheers.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.078
There we go.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.497
I'm floating!

29:58.421 --> 29:59.339
Tyler.

30:01.007 --> 30:01.925
Tyler!

30:03.551 --> 30:05.553
Tyler, look at me! I'm a ghost!

30:06.346 --> 30:07.388
Can you see me?

30:13.520 --> 30:15.146
- Whoo! Yeah!

30:19.484 --> 30:20.985
Whoo!

30:22.237 --> 30:24.906
Yeah!

30:30.245 --> 30:32.247
Whoa! Whoo!

30:33.581 --> 30:34.499
Yeah!

30:34.582 --> 30:35.708
-Whoa!

30:42.674 --> 30:43.967
Whoa...

30:48.972 --> 30:49.848
Cool.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.063
Yeah!

31:17.000 --> 31:19.002
We have our own cemetery?

31:21.462 --> 31:22.672
-Hello, there.
- Whoa!

31:25.258 --> 31:27.594
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to give you a fright.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.222
Are you a ghost like me?

31:31.514 --> 31:33.933
A ghost? Yes. But not like you.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.686
I passed on many, many years ago.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.564
The name's Chamberlain Locke.

31:39.647 --> 31:40.899
Hi, I'm Bode.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.734
I'm a Locke, too.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.569
I just moved here.

31:45.194 --> 31:48.656
How wonderful.
Key House has new inhabitants.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.950
Pleased to meet you, Bode.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.745
Have you seen my dad, Rendell?

31:54.370 --> 31:56.372
He might be a ghost, too.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.083
He died a few months ago.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.378
Oh, I haven't seen Rendell
in quite some time.

32:04.380 --> 32:07.717
If I may ask, where did your father die?

32:08.217 --> 32:09.302
Back in Seattle.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.848
Only those who've died on the property
like myself still roam here.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.895
Some have chosen to cross over,
but I myself prefer to stay.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.274
I'm so sorry
to hear about your father, Bode.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.902
He was a fine young man.

32:27.153 --> 32:28.821
-You knew him?

32:29.405 --> 32:31.115
Oh, he was my great grandson.

32:31.699 --> 32:35.286
He and his brother Duncan
used to fly around and explore.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.373
My dad used the keys?

32:39.082 --> 32:40.041
Oh, yes.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.297
That's my mom getting home. I better go.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.550
It was nice meeting you,
Great Great Grandpa

32:50.134 --> 32:52.136
-I'll come visit you again.

32:53.471 --> 32:54.555
Oh, thank you, Bode.

32:54.931 --> 32:55.765
I'd like that.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.411
What's Ellie doing here?

33:31.217 --> 33:32.093
Lucas.

33:33.845 --> 33:34.721
Lu...

33:37.140 --> 33:38.099
Lucas.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.905
Bode, did you eat the rest
of the chow mein?

33:57.577 --> 33:58.494
Bode?

34:04.792 --> 34:05.752
Bode?

34:17.597 --> 34:18.431
Bode?

34:23.186 --> 34:24.270
Quit screwing around.

34:28.816 --> 34:29.817
Bode?

34:30.777 --> 34:31.778
Bode!

34:32.403 --> 34:33.654
-Bode!

34:33.738 --> 34:34.906
-Wake up! Bode?

34:34.989 --> 34:35.948
-Gotcha!

34:38.076 --> 34:39.911
-What just happened?

34:39.994 --> 34:42.538
I found this key
that lets you turn into a ghost.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.586
I was floating around
and then I met our great great grandpa.

34:48.753 --> 34:49.670
That guy there.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.173
- And then he said--
-I thought you were dead!

34:52.965 --> 34:54.008
I'm sorry.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.803
We told you not to screw around
with the keys.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.846
-I know. I'm sorry.
-Then why did you?

35:00.014 --> 35:01.766
I just...

35:02.850 --> 35:04.435
thought I could find Dad.

35:16.781 --> 35:17.615
Wow.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.700
Looks like you've got
a lot of great options.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.037
When's the application deadline?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.163
Wednesday.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.999
I can only pick one so it has to be right.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.127
I love this shading here.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.462
Nah, it's too obvious.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.841
There's no point of view, no vision.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.512
These all came from your brain, sweetie.
Your brain, your vision.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.805
No one else's.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.268
Why don't you get out of the house
for a little bit?

35:45.518 --> 35:46.352
Huh?

35:46.894 --> 35:48.229
Just clear your mind.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.650
What're the kids from the hockey game
up to?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.361
Or your movie friends?

35:55.987 --> 35:58.281
Well, Scot invited me to something, but...

35:59.198 --> 36:00.366
I'm not gonna go.

36:00.825 --> 36:01.742
How come?

36:02.535 --> 36:04.620
'Cause I don't wanna screw it up.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.582
That shouldn't be your assumption.

36:08.624 --> 36:09.667
I disappoint people.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.419
Or they get hurt.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.796
I doubt that's true.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.631
-Who got hurt?

36:16.632 --> 36:17.592
This Scot guy?

36:17.675 --> 36:18.718
Not yet.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.179
But probably eventually.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.472
Or he'll hurt me.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.559
Decide I'm not as cool as he thought.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.605
And why does he get to decide what's cool?

36:31.189 --> 36:34.233
Well, he does spell his name
with only one T, so...

36:35.776 --> 36:36.694
Kinsey...

36:37.570 --> 36:38.404
Go.

36:38.821 --> 36:39.822
You'll have fun...

36:44.243 --> 36:46.078
You could never disappoint.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.078
A little to the left.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.497
How's that?

37:29.580 --> 37:31.040
-Good.
-Okay.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.335
We'll work on the Big Dipper
tomorrow night.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.676
If Dad used the keys,

37:43.552 --> 37:45.012
why wouldn't he have told us?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.765
Probably he forgot.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.184
Just like how Mom forgets.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.811
Maybe 'cause they're old.

37:51.936 --> 37:52.812
Or...

37:52.895 --> 37:54.063
He didn't want us using them.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.650
Chamberlain Locke said
he had fun with them.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.070
Then why'd he hate this place so much?

38:01.153 --> 38:02.113
Maybe...

38:03.823 --> 38:06.409
he was scared of the well lady, too.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.663
Yeah. Maybe.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.000
Me and Kinsey...

38:14.542 --> 38:15.584
we're here.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.378
