00:01.210 --> 00:03.553
Sergeant Hollister's
storied history

00:03.610 --> 00:05.089
with this department
is well-known to this board.

00:06.260 --> 00:08.865
Equally well-known
is his history
of recalcitrance,

00:08.920 --> 00:11.878
insubordination,
and disregard for
the chain of command.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.172
Sergeant Hollister,
let me make this clear for you.

00:14.230 --> 00:16.869
Did you or did you not warn
residents of this community

00:16.920 --> 00:18.968
about our joint
operation with ICE?

00:21.190 --> 00:22.703
I might've mentioned it.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.887
Bill, you jeopardized 30 million
in federal grants.

00:24.930 --> 00:27.535
Who the hell do you think
you are, Sergeant Hollister?

00:29.940 --> 00:31.066
I'm a lawman.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.631
Never took a dime.

00:34.590 --> 00:37.070
Never put my hands
on somebody unless I had to.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.549
Never pulled the trigger
when there was another way.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.387
You wanna hunt gangsters,
human traffickers?

00:46.780 --> 00:48.088
Well, I'm your huckleberry.

00:49.610 --> 00:51.692
But you're asking me to drag
families from their homes

00:51.740 --> 00:53.560
so you can eat
from the federal trough.

00:55.310 --> 00:56.868
When did you lose
your way, Jerry?

00:56.920 --> 00:58.911
At least I know
what century it is.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.264
Well, I swore
the same oath he did.

01:01.930 --> 01:03.147
I didn't swear it to you.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.058
I swore it to them.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.537
And I don't give
a pinch of dry turd

01:07.580 --> 01:09.059
how those folks got here.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.497
We're all immigrants.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.584
I gave my word
I'd protect them.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.246
Even if it's protecting them
from you.

01:17.590 --> 01:19.069
Here's the deal.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.338
You can tell Sheriff Bradford
if he wants my star,

01:22.250 --> 01:23.501
he knows where to find me.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.559
I come from
a long line of lawmen.

01:30.260 --> 01:32.728
was one of the first
Los Angeles Sheriff's deputies

01:32.780 --> 01:34.566
killed in the line of duty.

01:34.610 --> 01:37.261
He was shot by bandits
right off Sunset,

01:37.310 --> 01:39.744
just a cattle trail then.

01:39.790 --> 01:41.917
They say it was
a hell of a gunfight.

01:41.970 --> 01:43.574
But there's no plaque,

01:43.620 --> 01:45.440
nothing to mark
the spot where he died.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.961
Just one of those
hot yoga places now.

Come on, we gotta lose 'em.

03:02.050 --> 03:04.211
I don't think
it's diseased

03:04.270 --> 03:07.171
But it sure is sore

03:07.230 --> 03:10.040
You can't stop
Or I will pass you

03:10.100 --> 03:13.228
If you slow down
I will outlast you

03:13.280 --> 03:14.702

03:14.750 --> 03:17.969
You won't find me laughing

03:19.410 --> 03:22.368
And just one question
I might ask ya

03:22.410 --> 03:27.507
Can you make
this thing go faster?

04:23.690 --> 04:24.770

04:28.520 --> 04:29.475
What do you got, huh?

04:35.660 --> 04:37.264
Bill, what did you do?

04:37.970 --> 04:39.312
Majors running point on this?

04:39.360 --> 04:40.839
Looks pretty major to me.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.918
Well, I'm no detective,

04:42.970 --> 04:45.791
but Pelon and the artist
formerly known as Cisco there,

04:45.850 --> 04:47.329

But I know him.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.984
Oscar Villalobos.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.339
They call him Demon.
He's with the Cutdowns.

04:58.380 --> 05:00.428
You ever heard
of three rival gangs
working together?

05:00.470 --> 05:01.983
Maybe it's the score.

05:02.990 --> 05:05.038
Enough cheese,
they set aside
their differences.

05:06.870 --> 05:09.293

05:09.700 --> 05:10.860
Pelon had this on him.

05:12.350 --> 05:13.829
Some kinda cipher.

05:13.870 --> 05:16.009
Whatever it is,
he didn't want us havin' it.

How you doin', Julius?

05:34.070 --> 05:36.322
I'm not sayin' another word
without my union rep present.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.632
You don't get to ambush me

05:37.680 --> 05:39.329
after a deputy-involved
shooﬂng.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.207
The guy over there,
did you just dump him?

05:41.250 --> 05:42.114
Union rep.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.638
That's not why we're here.

05:44.690 --> 05:46.169
Oh, you just happened to be
in the neighborhood?

05:46.210 --> 05:47.814
No, we're here
because of Sheriff Bradford.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.340
If Sheriff Bradford thinks
his monkeys can intimidate me

05:50.390 --> 05:51.812
into retiring...

05:51.870 --> 05:53.383
Sheriff Bradford suffered
a serious heart attack

05:53.440 --> 05:54.566
earlier this afternoon.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.044
He was pronounced dead

that a duly elected sheriff
dies in office,

then the longest serving member
of his mounted posse

06:10.760 --> 06:12.364
shall serve as acting sheriff

can be elected.

these things, why?

07:20.170 --> 07:22.638
Because of some obscure rule
that nobody remembers

on a 150-year-old
piece of paper.

07:25.660 --> 07:28.618

in tallow or pigs or something.

gonna keep me in

09:55.680 --> 09:56.669
What's going on in there?

09:58.290 --> 10:00.417
Risk Management
compiled a list of 44 deputies

10:00.460 --> 10:02.416
most likely
to incur civil lawsuits.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.938
We're planning on
transition them
out of the field.

10:04.990 --> 10:07.163
You wanna pull 44 deputies
out of the field

10:07.210 --> 10:08.939
because you're afraid
they might get sued?

10:09.780 --> 10:11.338
I want more deputies
in the field,

10:11.390 --> 10:13.904
where they belong,
where they can do their jobs.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.518
How do you decide
who makes the list?

10:15.570 --> 10:17.913
Anyone with 16 or more
categorical uses of force

10:17.960 --> 10:19.734
within a three-year period,
for one.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.348
Oh. Well, I think... Jeez.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.436
-I must be, uh--
-Right at the top.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.707
BILL: Yeah.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.744
Shred these.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.051
That's a direct order.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.188
BISHOP: So what was
that about back there?

10:32.190 --> 10:33.794
Jerry and I go way back.

10:36.330 --> 10:37.536
He knows where
all the bodies are buried

10:37.590 --> 10:38.978
because he's the one
who buried them.

10:39.020 --> 10:39.975
Why are we here?

10:41.160 --> 10:43.856
-It's your office.
-Oh, I know. Believe me.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.023
Called on the carpet
enough times over the years.

10:47.820 --> 10:48.980
Aren't you gonna sit down?

10:49.730 --> 10:50.640
What the hell for?

10:51.250 --> 10:52.512
There's no crooks in here.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.687
No witnesses. No victims.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.867
Unless Villalobos
is hiding under that desk,

10:56.910 --> 10:59.640
there is currently nothing
in here that interests me.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.340
Come on.
Gotta deputize my godson.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.264
BISHO_P:
Yes, Sir.

11:05.050 --> 11:07.518
-WOMAN: Sheriff!
-[over|apping chatter]

11:08.580 --> 11:10.445
OFFICER: Alien-hut!

11:11.580 --> 11:12.797
What's with all the press?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.535
Here to get a look
at the new sheriff.

11:16.450 --> 11:17.360
Hey.

11:20.370 --> 11:21.405
God.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.938
-He looks so much like Rick.
-I know.

11:26.460 --> 11:27.586
Undersheriff.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.280
Honey, this is Deputy Bishop.

11:31.770 --> 11:33.556
Practically perfect
in every way.

11:38.210 --> 11:39.905
My heart goes out
to you, Deputy.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.120
Thank you, ma'am.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.051
As his son...

11:59.060 --> 12:00.971
you're the only one
authorized to wear this.

12:04.410 --> 12:05.490
I don't know what to say.

12:06.900 --> 12:07.969
Neither do I.

12:11.810 --> 12:14.153
OFFICER:
Cadets, atten-hut!

12:17.820 --> 12:20.425
Cadets, at ease!

12:26.780 --> 12:27.781
[clears throat]

12:31.700 --> 12:33.611
It ought to be
Sheriff Bradford up here.

12:37.660 --> 12:39.093
He and I had our differences,

12:40.020 --> 12:41.533
though we wore the same star.

12:42.540 --> 12:43.666
Makes us family.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.358
And that's what's happening
here today.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.633
You're all becoming
mﬂwahmm

12:57.820 --> 12:59.151
With its own traditions...

13:00.470 --> 13:01.949
and skeletons.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.551
Look to your left and right.

13:07.740 --> 13:08.775
Come on, do it.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.780
They're your family now.

13:14.180 --> 13:15.306
You can count on 'em.

13:16.790 --> 13:19.133
And you better make damn sure
they can count on you.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.229
You need three things
to do this job.

13:23.540 --> 13:24.575
A badge...

13:25.890 --> 13:26.879
a gun...

13:28.890 --> 13:30.141
and what's in your heart.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.974
Policy and procedure be damned.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.544
[murmuring]

13:34.590 --> 13:35.978
The end of the day,

13:36.030 --> 13:38.066
you gotta be able to look
yourself in the mirror

13:38.600 --> 13:39.669
and ask...

13:41.030 --> 13:43.373
"Did I do everything
I could have possibly done

13:43.430 --> 13:45.079
to protect the innocent?"

13:47.340 --> 13:48.386
This department...

13:49.260 --> 13:50.511
has lost its way.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.917
TOO many save-asses. . .

13:58.700 --> 14:00.349
and not enough ass-kickers.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.097
Show of hands...

14:06.410 --> 14:08.184
_ who here falls
in the latter category?

14:18.070 --> 14:20.857
Welcome to the Los Angeles
Sheriff's Department.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.856
[audience cheering]

14:40.440 --> 14:41.998
Thank you, guys.
You did great.

14:42.050 --> 14:42.914
OFFICER:
It's an honor, sir.

14:42.960 --> 14:43.915
-Great job.
-Thank you, sir.

14:48.230 --> 14:49.401
I didn't think you'd come.

14:49.450 --> 14:50.485
That isn't why I'm here.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.756
Joseph wants to be his father.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.846
And he isn't.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.754
I came to ask you to fire him.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.279
Laurie, I...
I can't do that.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.410
LAURIE:
Yes, you can.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.450
You're the Sheriff.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.242
And you're his godfather.

15:04.290 --> 15:05.939
You're supposed to
look out for him.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.068
Just like you were supposed
to look out for my husband.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.633
Rick was your partner.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.297
If you care anything
about Joseph,

15:13.340 --> 15:15.558
you will run him out of this
godforsaken department

15:15.610 --> 15:17.214
before he gets killed.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.568
[horns honking]

15:23.610 --> 15:24.599
Hey.

15:24.660 --> 15:26.139
So what do we call you now?

15:26.180 --> 15:27.613
-BILL [over phone]: Bill.
-CADE: That Bill?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.048
Shouldn't he be out
kissing babies or something?

15:29.100 --> 15:30.260
RACHEL:
Cade wants to know--

15:30.320 --> 15:31.924
Yeah, I heard him.
Tell him to kiss my ass.

15:31.970 --> 15:33.483
Then tell me
about the armored car.

15:33.540 --> 15:35.622
RACHEL: Weird one.
Armored car carried no cash.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.490
Just documents
from Cabriamex.

15:37.540 --> 15:38.928
Bank in Century City.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.402
Maybe these idiots
hit the wrong truck.

15:40.460 --> 15:41.973
Villalobos ain't that stupid.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.058
Those gangsters say
how they cliqued up?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.668
RACHEL: They called it
"The Reckoning."

15:45.720 --> 15:47.244
-We||, who's calling the shots?
-RACHEL: That's the thing.

15:47.290 --> 15:48.939
I don't think these
knuckleheads even know.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.503
I think Oscar
was the middleman.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.812
How about the cipher
on the paper?

15:51.860 --> 15:53.077
RACHEL: Nada.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.428
But if these gangs
are changing the game,

15:54.470 --> 15:56.074
they could be drawing up
new boundaries.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.257
BILL:
My buddy works County.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.165
Memory serves
he's got a friendly

15:59.210 --> 16:00.996
that might have
a line on Villalobos.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.428
CADE: Move!

16:02.480 --> 16:03.822
Am I calling at a bad time?

16:03.870 --> 16:05.303
Get out of the way.
Out of the way!

16:05.350 --> 16:06.658
RACHEL: Naw.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.349
Just on our way
to inseminate Cade's wife.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.482
Ew, that sounds gross
when you say it like that.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.528
Hey. Where's my wife?

16:14.580 --> 16:16.093
Teresa Ward.
I'm supposed to meet my wife.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.277
-WOMAN: Right through there.
-Thank you.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.309
WOMAN: You're welcome.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.140
You're not my wife.

16:21.670 --> 16:22.580
Babe?

16:23.020 --> 16:24.009
Honey.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.492
Cuttin' it a little close.

16:25.540 --> 16:27.622
Man, this place is starting
to feel like a casino.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.806
Yeah.

16:28.850 --> 16:30.249
Here, sign and date
at the bottom.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.639
-Hmm.
-Ten percent success rate.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.500
Of course, after 40
it drops down to--

16:35.550 --> 16:36.687
Fifty-fifty.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.729
We have a 50 percent shot here.

16:39.780 --> 16:41.122
How do you figure that?

16:41.170 --> 16:42.467
'Cause everything is.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.646
Fifty-fifty.

16:43.690 --> 16:44.998
Heads or tails.

16:45.040 --> 16:45.995
Binary.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.689
Either it happens or it won't.

16:48.390 --> 16:49.994
All those numbers,
they're not us.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.735
Alright? And they're not now.

16:52.270 --> 16:55.046
_ And us now
is all I care about.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.389
I, um, finally heard
from the county.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.747
And we're approved.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.408
We're officially qualified
to be foster parents.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.791
Oh, babe, I thought
you'd be happy.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.017
1--
I grew up in the system.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.799
I know what it takes
to survive in there.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.188
All right?
You have to grow claws.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.729
You end up
using 'em on people
who are tryin' to help.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.375
But those people aren't us.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.552
NURSE:
Instructions are on the cup.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.069
-Y'a|| done with
that clipboard?
-TERESA: Oh, yeah.

17:25.130 --> 17:26.336
And, um, I'd prefer you

17:26.390 --> 17:28.858
not to_conceive our
first child usmg porn.

17:28.910 --> 17:30.252
_You wanna
come in there With me?

17:30.310 --> 17:31.641
[laughing] Can I?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.354
BILL: Who are you
trying to impress, old man?

17:41.400 --> 17:42.219
[grunts]

17:42.270 --> 17:43.669
All you.

17:44.580 --> 17:45.535
[grunting in effort]

17:45.580 --> 17:46.831
Come on. You got it.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.229
[sighs]

17:50.850 --> 17:52.363
You really know
how to win friends

17:52.410 --> 17:54.196
and influence people,
you know it?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.229
Oh, you heard, huh?

17:55.290 --> 17:57.372
Place is high school
with guns.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.637
Tell me about it.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.989
Look, uh, I'm huntin'
Oscar Villalobos.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.203
You still got that friendly
who's tight with him?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.638
That's one way to put it.

18:04.690 --> 18:06.248
Daisy. Woman scorned.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.722
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.941
I got another favor to ask.
Big one.

18:10.950 --> 18:13.089
My godson Joseph Harris,

18:13.130 --> 18:15.303
he's comin' out of the academy,
headin' your way.

18:15.350 --> 18:16.521
Rick's kid?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.430
Lord, we're old.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.486
You want me
to look out for him?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.429
I want you to fire him.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.576
His evals.
Un-sat him across the board.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.269
And I'll take care of the rest.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.448
I don't think
I can do that, Bill.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.013
Kid doesn't
have it in him, Bobby.

18:33.890 --> 18:36.279
I'm not losing 'em both.
I can't do that.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.286
Get me Oscar.

18:47.030 --> 18:48.679
FISKE:
3,000 floor.

18:48.730 --> 18:50.334
Where_ we house
our most Violent inmates.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.425
Gasser's Alley.

18:51.470 --> 18:52.550
OFFICER:
What are you staring at?

18:53.560 --> 18:54.993
Why do they call it
Gasser's Alley?

18:55.740 --> 18:57.037
FISKE:
It's what they call it
when they launch

18:57.090 --> 18:59.513
urine and feces at you
through the meal slots.

18:59.570 --> 19:00.821
Gassing.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.826
Nice way to catch hepatitis.

19:04.010 --> 19:04.999
Got a mouth-breather?

19:05.050 --> 19:06.005
No, sir.

19:06.050 --> 19:07.130
That helps.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.445
This is K6G. Gay Wing.

19:10.490 --> 19:11.969
Different vibe here.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.829
Guys here are
kicked around in the street.

19:14.890 --> 19:17.495
In here, pressure's off.
Nobody hassles 'em.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.457
Problem is we got
hardcore gangbangers lyin',

19:20.500 --> 19:22.456
sayin' they're gay
just to get in here.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.456
So we come up
with a series of questions

19:24.510 --> 19:25.499
to try to trip 'em up.

19:25.550 --> 19:26.858
JOSEPH: Like what?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.209
Like what's the cover charge
at the Apache?

19:29.250 --> 19:31.468
Or what's the name of
Michael Beck's character

19:31.510 --> 19:32.465
in Xanadu.

19:32.510 --> 19:34.034
What's Xanadu?

19:34.080 --> 19:37.038
You mean to tell me
you've never heard of Xanadu?

19:37.080 --> 19:40.083
The Citizen Kane
of roller skate rock operas?

19:40.130 --> 19:42.473
Daisy's kind of
the den mother of K6G.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.738
Daisy, meet Deputy Harris.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.520
Can we talk for a second?

19:52.140 --> 19:53.391
Friends of mine
are lookin' for Oscar.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.008
Oscar know he's got heat?

19:55.060 --> 19:56.095
Definitely.

19:57.060 --> 19:59.711
First place I'd look
is FS-13 hood.

20:00.110 --> 20:01.532
FS-13? Come on.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.588
DAISY:
Counter-intuitive, I know.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.621
But there's...
there's been this reckoning.

20:06.110 --> 20:09.022
Old enemies are now allies.

20:09.070 --> 20:11.379

using Cabriamex

30:58.900 --> 31:00.413
and the gangs
to launder money.

31:00.460 --> 31:02.985
Villalobos and Sombra
were working for 'em.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.895
So they're not
just pretty faces.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.031
That was a joke.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.163
Better Sombra than you, Cade.

31:10.210 --> 31:12.166
I don't give a damn
about that scumbag.

31:12.210 --> 31:13.336
It's about those kids.

31:13.390 --> 31:14.994
You know, their life
is rough enough

31:15.040 --> 31:16.860
and now they're gonna get thrown
into a system with no way out.

31:16.910 --> 31:17.990
You found a way.

31:18.050 --> 31:19.608
It's not that easy.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.912
If you and your sister
had landed with good people,

31:21.960 --> 31:23.439
it would have been
a Whole different story.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.393
What are you saying, Bill?

31:26.230 --> 31:29.222
You and Teresa should consider
fostering those kids.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.099
If only we knew somebody
with a little pull

31:32.150 --> 31:33.708
that could make that happen,
you know.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.625
Did you think when you
woke up this morning

31:35.670 --> 31:36.887
that I'd be sheriff

31:36.930 --> 31:38.886
and you might be
fostering two kids?

31:39.330 --> 31:41.457
How in the hell
did we end up here?

31:42.420 --> 31:43.899
You got no idea
how many times

31:43.940 --> 31:46.113
I've asked myself
that same question today.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.988
Dig into Cabriamex.

31:48.810 --> 31:49.890
CADE:
You got it, Sheriff.

31:51.430 --> 31:54.069
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

31:59.300 --> 32:00.642
[knocking]

32:03.090 --> 32:04.307
Hey, Mr. McGowan?

32:04.790 --> 32:06.439
-Yes.
-I'm Deputy Ward.

32:07.310 --> 32:08.789
Huh.

32:08.830 --> 32:10.650
I slipped on one of
my daughter's toys and, uh...

32:11.620 --> 32:12.746
May I come in?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.449
Uh, it's not
a good time, actually.

32:14.490 --> 32:16.219
Maybe that's why
you still haven't asked
me why I'm here yet.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.759
-Drop the gun.
-[McGowan gasps]

32:17.800 --> 32:19.404
-Who else is in the house?
-Just my wife. I swear!

32:19.450 --> 32:21.054
-I thought you
were one of them.
-Who?

32:21.110 --> 32:22.589
He had a uniform and a badge.

32:22.630 --> 32:23.938
I thought he was
a deputy sheriff.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.231
He said no police!

32:25.290 --> 32:26.939
-Get him out!
-What do you want me to do?

32:26.980 --> 32:28.766
He's gonna kill Debbie!
Get him out!

32:28.810 --> 32:30.243
CADE:
All right, calm down.

32:30.290 --> 32:31.416
MRS. MCGOWAN:
He's gonna kill
our little girl!

32:31.470 --> 32:32.949
-Get him out!
-SEC-David-Frank—5.

32:32.990 --> 32:34.981
Requesting two units
to my location.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.337
Possible kidnapping.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.939
McGowan has been washing
cartel money.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.252
Billions, through
Cabriamex Financial

32:43.300 --> 32:44.517
in Century City.

32:44.570 --> 32:46.515
Cartel gets the idea
that he's been skimming,

32:48.660 --> 32:49.957
And that
armored car robbery?

32:50.010 --> 32:51.693
That was a surprise audit.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.875
They find What they
were looking for?

32:53.920 --> 32:55.649
Not enough to make
McGowan think they did.

32:55.710 --> 32:57.439
They spooked him
into a confession.

32:57.490 --> 32:59.708
So Oscar Villalobos
breaks out of County,

32:59.760 --> 33:01.887
takes the little girl
and calls McGowan,

33:01.930 --> 33:04.103
says cough up the 20 mil
he pocketed

33:04.150 --> 33:05.367
or they'd kill her.

33:05.410 --> 33:07.628
Hence the Mitt Romney
impersonators.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.638
It's kidnapping, brother.
It's FBI's jurisdiction.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.456
Respectfully, Sheriff,
a cartel kidnapping?

33:13.510 --> 33:15.728
And the FBI wants to
take it off your hands.

33:15.770 --> 33:16.850
Sheriff, that's a gift.

33:17.210 --> 33:18.165
Well, all right.

33:21.910 --> 33:23.639
What would the old sheriff do?

33:23.690 --> 33:26.739
Well, the smart play
is to give the FBI
the poison chalice.

33:26.780 --> 33:28.862
We do not want to be
the agency of record

33:28.910 --> 33:30.525
when they find
this kid's remains.

33:32.530 --> 33:33.827
That is how this ends.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.222
With corpse-sniffing dogs

33:35.270 --> 33:37.352
and a tear-filled
press conference.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.484
Russ Bowes,
special agent in charge

33:39.530 --> 33:40.701
of the Bureau's LA Office.

33:40.750 --> 33:42.479
Bill Hollister.
Anything we can do?

33:42.540 --> 33:44.144
For now,
I don't wanna offend you,

33:44.190 --> 33:45.748
but you can help
by staying out of our way.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.142
This is what we do, Sheriff.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.589
We'll take it from here.

33:48.630 --> 33:50.143
All due respect, cousin,

33:50.200 --> 33:52.839
you can have
that press conference
all to yourself.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.151
I don't like 'em anyway.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.064
That's what I heard.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.849
I just want the kid
back home safe.

33:57.900 --> 33:59.891
I want Villalobos
back in custody.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.503
Not one of those things
is gonna happen
you cut us out of this.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.551
IfI had a nickel
for every time
I heard that speech

34:05.600 --> 34:07.511
from a local tough guy
with a shiny badge

34:07.560 --> 34:08.686
and a bruised ego...

34:08.740 --> 34:11.129
I'll take my chances...
Sheriff.

34:13.310 --> 34:15.562
They sure do dress nice,
don't they?

34:17.400 --> 34:18.913
The odds of finding
this kid alive--

34:18.960 --> 34:20.700
Fifty-fifty. All right?

34:20.750 --> 34:22.229
Either we find her
or we won't.

34:22.270 --> 34:24.352
No reason not to be optimistic.

34:24.410 --> 34:25.798
Who taught you math?

34:25.840 --> 34:28.968
Bishop, I know what
the smart play here is.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.054
It's just that...

34:31.670 --> 34:33.752
I like to do
dumb things sometimes.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.899
[indistinct chatter]

34:42.950 --> 34:46.113
Well, ain't we a pair, Joseph?

34:46.170 --> 34:47.376
Your boyfriend's a jerk.

34:47.430 --> 34:49.421
DAISY:
Story of my life, kiddo,

34:49.470 --> 34:52.348
which you saved by the way.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.386
Thank you.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.079
The other day,
when Fiske asked you...

34:58.130 --> 34:59.609
you said the first place
you'd look for him

34:59.660 --> 35:01.082
was Sombra's pad.

35:01.140 --> 35:02.789
And look where it got me.

35:02.830 --> 35:04.309
What's the second place
you'd look?

35:06.270 --> 35:09.535
He kidnapped a little girl
wearing my father's badge.

35:10.450 --> 35:13.101
Help me get her back,
we'll call it square.

35:13.150 --> 35:15.141
I am many things, Joseph,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.100
but square is not one of them.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.978
But how can I say no
to that face?

35:22.810 --> 35:28.157
I heard they were
cooking meth
up in Lancaster.

35:29.030 --> 35:30.554
Lieutenant Fiske,
can I borrow your phone?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.251
This is it.

35:38.310 --> 35:39.959
All the_ transmission lines
in Lancaster.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.139
All right, so they wanna be
off the grid,

35:42.180 --> 35:43.602
but still have access
to the power

35:43.660 --> 35:44.957
they need for the cook.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.432
All the power lines
are running all along

35:46.490 --> 35:48.617
the old Pear Blossom Highway.

35:48.660 --> 35:49.968
That's over
a hundred miles long.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.181
CADE:
Yeah, we gotta
narrow that down.

36:02.590 --> 36:05.024
Now I know Why Tracho was
tryin' to eat the damn thing.

36:05.510 --> 36:06.716
It's a map to their hideout.

So how'd you know
about this place?

36:28.400 --> 36:30.789

My dad and I used to
hunt hogs out here.

36:31.270 --> 36:33.738
Those boys sure don't look like
they're huntin' hogs.

36:34.270 --> 36:35.612
How do we know
she's even in there?

in there with her.

They'll see us coming
a mile off.

Call SEB. Go in heavy.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.721
Yeah. Welcome to Ruby Ridge.

36:54.770 --> 36:56.635
It'll take us an hour
to hike down.

Where'd this happen?

Lancaster.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.600
Long story.

39:18.090 --> 39:19.216
And you drove all the way
over here to get treated?

39:21.270 --> 39:23.738
"I'm sorry"
would've done the trick.

39:24.570 --> 39:25.446
Yeah.

39:27.930 --> 39:28.965
I am sorry.

39:32.230 --> 39:33.925
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

CADE: My sister and I
had the same arrangement.

40:20.850 --> 40:22.147
Places that we grew up,

40:22.200 --> 40:23.929
I didn't want anybody
sneaking up on her.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.932
So we slept in shifts.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.074
But this isn't
one of those places.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.018
You understand?

40:32.770 --> 40:34.249
You're safe here.

40:34.300 --> 40:35.517
You're the one
who shot my dad.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.509
CADE: Yeah.

40:40.650 --> 40:41.821
Then I'm gonna kill you.

40:43.480 --> 40:44.868
I'm sorry you lost him.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.995
And I'm sorry for everything

40:47.050 --> 40:48.392
that happened to you
before that.

40:51.490 --> 40:53.094
I had no choice.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.960
He was gonna kill me
and I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.884
Now, you want to avenge him.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.142
I don't think
he's worth it, but...

41:03.370 --> 41:04.712
you're entitled, I guess.

41:07.630 --> 41:08.801
But here's the deal.

41:10.550 --> 41:11.721
You can't kill me.

41:12.860 --> 41:13.895
Not now.

41:14.730 --> 41:15.890
You're too small.

41:16.690 --> 41:17.816
And I'm too good.

41:19.120 --> 41:20.997
You know, I used to kill guys
for a living.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.292
I was a sniper
in the Marine Corps.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.477
And I used to watch my targets
for a long time.

41:26.870 --> 41:30.476
Learn their habits,
best place to take 'em.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.833
Maybe you can do that with me.

41:36.180 --> 41:38.262
Stay with us, that way
you can keep an eye on me.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.662
Meantime, we will take care
of you and your sister.

41:41.710 --> 41:43.837
And we won't let anything
happen to either one of you.

41:45.190 --> 41:46.054
That way...

41:47.110 --> 41:48.270
you can watch me and...

41:49.850 --> 41:50.885
wait for your shot.

41:54.200 --> 41:55.371
That sound like a plan?

41:59.690 --> 42:00.509
Okay.

42:02.250 --> 42:03.296
Okay.

Hey.

42:29.410 --> 42:30.581
I never had any business

42:30.630 --> 42:31.710

in the first place.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.068
And I think you know it.

42:33.630 --> 42:34.756
Well, I thought I did.

42:36.110 --> 42:37.896
I even asked Fiske
to run you out.

42:40.070 --> 42:42.243
I'm saving you the subterfuge.

42:42.770 --> 42:43.816
I resign.

42:45.250 --> 42:47.252
I was supposed to have
your old man's back.

42:49.610 --> 42:51.475
I've been wearing it
the last 10 years.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.560
I swear...

42:58.180 --> 42:59.522
I could see him right now,

43:00.490 --> 43:02.173
looking back at me

43:05.190 --> 43:06.487
I was wrong about you, son.

43:08.020 --> 43:09.487
And I refuse to allow you
to feel sorry for yourself.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.624
'Cause your dad
wouldn't want that.

43:16.940 --> 43:19.158
And I do not accept
your resignation.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.858
'Cause the only way you can
dishonor his memory now

43:27.690 --> 43:28.770
is by quitting.

43:39.790 --> 43:43.089
BILL:
My dad used to say there are
no victories on the job.

43:43.140 --> 43:45.563
Just the fight,
and it never ends.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.571
-You ready, partner?
-Yes, Sheriff.

43:53.710 --> 43:55.109
BILL:
You're blessed
if you wake up

43:55.150 --> 43:57.277
with another chance
to make it right.

43:57.330 --> 43:59.104
Another chance
to force the world

43:59.150 --> 44:00.492
to be a little nicer.

44:11.860 --> 44:12.986
You okay, Sheriff?

44:15.040 --> 44:16.166
Gettin' there.

44:17.690 --> 44:19.692
It's been a hell of a first
couple days, huh, Bishop?

44:20.700 --> 44:22.213
Actually, it's, uh,
it's been four days.

44:24.220 --> 44:25.266
Time flies.

44:31.230 --> 44:33.130
Look on the bright side,
Sheriff.

44:33.190 --> 44:34.919
Only 110 more days to go.

44:35.620 --> 44:37.099
BILL:
Let's just get
through this one.

44:38.850 --> 44:40.317
BISHOP:
Gotta say, the last few days
have had their challenges,

44:40.370 --> 44:41.849
but it's been quite a ride.

44:41.890 --> 44:43.016
Well, buckle up.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.108
I'm just gettin' started.

44:45.770 --> 44:47.544
