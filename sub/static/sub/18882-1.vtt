00:36.404 --> 00:38.840
This is a story of the past...

00:38.940 --> 00:40.441
and the future.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.637
We will come to the future,
but first, the past.

00:47.949 --> 00:50.451
Here we have the Earl of Warwick.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.920
We can see by
his petulantly arched brow...

00:53.020 --> 00:55.648
that he is not en route to a good deed.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.401
Mmm.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.403
Obey!

01:09.503 --> 01:11.300
Enchanted...

01:14.175 --> 01:17.378
Do you wish to live, old witch?

01:17.478 --> 01:21.816
You have committed grave crimes
against God and your king, have you not?

01:21.916 --> 01:23.050
- Have mercy, my lord.
- Silence.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.052
The Frenchman Count Thibault of Malfete...

01:25.152 --> 01:27.955
shall wed Lady Rosalind,
the daughter of our king.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.757
I desire that woman.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.351
Hmm.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.331
I alone am fit to take her hand.

01:37.431 --> 01:42.303
And her castle, lands,
the riches that are her dowry.

01:42.403 --> 01:45.139
Thou art not as stupid
as thou art hideous, old hag.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.241
Tomorrow night...

01:47.341 --> 01:50.538
the king shall feast
the arrival of the count.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.249
I want the count dead
before the feast is over.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.918
A small fortune in gold...

01:57.018 --> 02:00.488
awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.856
Not so fast.

02:01.956 --> 02:05.159
How shall I know thy magic
is sufficient to the task?

02:05.259 --> 02:07.461
Does thou find proof enough in this?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.625
Aah!

02:37.725 --> 02:39.727
That will do!

02:39.827 --> 02:41.886
Take it, witch!

02:44.131 --> 02:45.900
Was that proof enough, my lord?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.702
Come to the king's castle
tomorrow night...

02:47.802 --> 02:49.136
and carry out my plan.

02:49.236 --> 02:52.933
If you fail... you will be burned.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.044
Ohh!

03:01.282 --> 03:03.784
Our hero, of course, knew none of this.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.653
He was safely in his entourage...

03:05.753 --> 03:08.322
traveling, he thought, to his wedding.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.392
Here he is... the Count of Malfete.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.261
He is also a duke, a baron, and a lord.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.932
A nobleman, plagued by
only those small things...

03:18.032 --> 03:19.800
which inconvenience a knight...

03:19.900 --> 03:22.236
the permanent presence of his sisters...

03:22.336 --> 03:23.404
his mother and father...

03:23.504 --> 03:25.740
and, as all knights must endure...

03:25.840 --> 03:28.609
an idiot servant, Andre...

03:28.709 --> 03:30.244
whose smell made people faint...

03:30.344 --> 03:31.879
a considerable achievement...

03:31.979 --> 03:33.781
among a population who never bathed.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.178
Down, peasant!

03:42.456 --> 03:44.558
The duke, or Thibault...

03:44.658 --> 03:46.594
as his subjects were
not allowed to call him...

03:46.694 --> 03:47.828
was joyous.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.232
The long-awaited day
of his marriage had come at last.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.702
What have we got here?
Another lot of bloody royal bastards?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.838
Must be that French duke
come to marry the king's daughter.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.839
Mind the forest!

03:58.939 --> 04:02.810
There be dragons who'll make dinner
from your bones in there!

04:04.612 --> 04:07.615
Andre loved and protected his master.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.750
Master! Master!

04:09.850 --> 04:11.752
The forest... it is haunted!

04:11.852 --> 04:14.722
Thibault responded.

04:15.372 --> 04:17.807
Thank you, master.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.327
With every step...

04:21.428 --> 04:24.665
he came closer to
the castle of his beloved.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.635
He hoped he would be with her soon...

04:27.735 --> 04:29.937
for rare was the journey
in which Thibault...

04:30.037 --> 04:32.840
did not have to stop and rescue someone.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.306
This was no exception...

04:38.312 --> 04:39.447
For like his ancestors...

04:39.547 --> 04:41.816
he lived by an ancient family rule...

04:41.916 --> 04:43.617
A woman in distress!

04:43.717 --> 04:45.119
The only one he knew.

04:45.219 --> 04:46.720
Aah! Aah!

04:46.820 --> 04:47.988
Beware, sire.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.791
Courage was more than a duty.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.483
Courage was his creed.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.826
Aah!

05:06.240 --> 05:09.110
Andre! Join your master!

05:09.210 --> 05:12.441
I'm talking to you!
Go, go! Stupid peasant!

05:17.751 --> 05:20.015
Sire! Behind you!

05:22.089 --> 05:23.078
Ohh!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.863
Naturally...

05:28.963 --> 05:30.397
Courage is our creed!

05:30.497 --> 05:33.466
He was invincible.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.038
Except he was not invincible...

05:38.138 --> 05:39.874
against witchcraft.

05:39.974 --> 05:42.543
For this would be his last victory...

05:42.643 --> 05:44.975
in this millennium.

05:52.253 --> 05:53.743
Afternoon, sir.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.187
I hear a rumor...

06:26.287 --> 06:28.722
thou art marrying tomorrow, my lord.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.391
I have heard this rumor.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.926
I have also heard...

06:32.026 --> 06:36.230
the bride is the most beautiful
in all of England.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.598
But it is not true.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.567
- It is not?
- No.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.436
Am I not the most beautiful bride...

06:42.536 --> 06:44.338
in all of England?

06:44.438 --> 06:47.141
No. Wait.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.643
The most beautiful bride...

06:49.743 --> 06:51.438
in all the world.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.821
Wear this for me, Thibault.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.389
Wear it against thine heart.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.953
Thou shalt always be true.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.068
Lady Rosalind.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.170
Thou shalt not disgrace thyself...

07:16.270 --> 07:17.601
before the wedding.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.398
I must hide and dress for the banquet.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.224
Ooh ooh ohh!

07:45.766 --> 07:49.303
Sire, your bride looks
like a gorgeous sparrow.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.472
Silence, you impudent peasant.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.874
Show respect to your future mistress.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.771
Yes, master.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.549
Ah! Thank you, my lord.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.468
Quite so, Your Majesty.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.575
When our lady drinks her wine...

08:28.675 --> 08:31.078
her eyes will fill with hellish visions.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.746
The count will appear as a hideous beast.

08:33.847 --> 08:38.852
Then my magic will compel her
to kill him. Ha ha ha.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.491
My dear friends and noble guests.

08:44.591 --> 08:48.529
Thibault, Count of
Malfete and Papincourt...

08:48.629 --> 08:53.167
I hereby declare this castle
a wedding present.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.202
Hear ye!

08:55.302 --> 08:58.605
Your Majesty,
in every way that I am able...

08:58.705 --> 09:00.808
I will serve my beautiful lady...

09:00.908 --> 09:03.844
and do honor to thy kingdom.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.286
Drink of my cup...
and you will know my thoughts.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.479
And thou wilt know mine.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.134
My lord?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.103
- Ah!
- Thibault!

09:29.203 --> 09:30.830
My lord!

09:42.816 --> 09:44.118
What is it, Thibault?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.723
This is not the kind of behavior...

09:49.823 --> 09:52.726
What is happening to you, my son?

09:52.826 --> 09:55.329
Are you crazy? Drunk?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.664
Count Thibault,
this is no way to behave...

09:57.764 --> 09:59.333
in an English court!

09:59.433 --> 10:00.957
Beasts from Hell!

10:04.538 --> 10:07.074
Ohh! That is my mother!

10:07.174 --> 10:08.842
Thibault, that is my mother!

10:12.346 --> 10:13.280
Demon!

10:14.581 --> 10:16.139
Oh, no!

10:20.521 --> 10:24.258
No! What have I done?

10:24.358 --> 10:27.816
It is not me. It is witchcraft!

10:29.463 --> 10:31.556
Andre, find me a wizard!

10:32.966 --> 10:35.636
France must pay for this treachery.

10:35.736 --> 10:36.930
Find me a wizard!

10:48.081 --> 10:52.052
Have pity on a poor condemned man.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.189
We are here for the last rites.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.404
My lord! We have to hurry.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.473
What wizard is this?

11:12.573 --> 11:16.031
He's English, my lord.
But his magic is very good.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.280
Your bloody Earl of Warwick
did this to me.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.082
Indeed he did.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.319
And he'd have me, too,
if he knew that I was here.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.421
I beg you, my sire. Let him save you.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.157
Can you bring my lady back from the dead?

11:30.257 --> 11:32.059
I can reanimate her corpse...

11:32.159 --> 11:33.760
but I don't think that my lord...

11:33.860 --> 11:36.697
would like the way she looks... or smells.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.902
There is another way.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.310
Time is like a mountain.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.647
Riddled with tunnels.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.783
I can open one
of these tunnels for thee...

11:56.883 --> 12:00.614
and return thee to the moment
before the murder.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.587
If thy will is strong enough.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.432
Don't you think this priest
has had enough time?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.258
Hurry up, Father.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.143
Unlock this door! Now!

12:23.844 --> 12:26.346
Drink this potion, my lord...

12:26.446 --> 12:30.417
and thou shalt descend
into the Mountain of Time.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.287
Ohh! It smells awful.

12:33.387 --> 12:34.821
You should not drink that.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.958
What if you become a frog, or goat's feet?

12:38.058 --> 12:40.027
You are right.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.929
Drink first, bastard.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.432
And if you die, I will avenge your death.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.693
What are you doing in there?

12:54.675 --> 12:56.006
Open this door!

12:57.778 --> 12:59.479
Open this door!

12:59.579 --> 13:02.883
It tastes like the shit of the pork.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.318
And he should know.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.124
Ohh.

13:11.224 --> 13:14.494
Per Horus et per Ra...

13:18.799 --> 13:20.790
Et per Salem...

13:22.936 --> 13:24.771
invictus...

13:28.875 --> 13:31.036
Ducere!

13:50.931 --> 13:52.966
I forgot the grouse eggs.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.468
Oh, it's a disaster.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.971
I've lost them in the corridors of Time.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.972
Open this door! Open this door!

14:23.630 --> 14:24.931
Wow. Cool!

14:25.031 --> 14:26.066
This is cool.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.468
This is pretty cool, yeah. Look at them!

14:28.568 --> 14:29.770
Shh.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.506
See the peasant sleeping on the floor?

14:32.606 --> 14:34.508
In those days, people didn't think...

14:34.608 --> 14:36.743
that peasants deserved
any better than that...

14:36.843 --> 14:40.247
and they were considered
the property of their masters.

14:40.347 --> 14:44.184
Now, the boss of this peasant
is the knight.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.388
See how beautiful
the knight's clothing is?

14:48.488 --> 14:51.625
Miss Rodett, that one is hot,
and it just snorted!

14:52.425 --> 14:55.429
Now, Tammy, that's impossible
because they're just mannequins...

14:55.529 --> 14:57.097
and mannequins don't snort.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.799
Well, that one just did.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.269
No, because they're not real.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.462
They're just like... dolls.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.176
Ah! Oh, shit!

15:09.276 --> 15:10.911
What are you doing in my chamber?

15:25.992 --> 15:27.327
Your chamber...

15:27.427 --> 15:30.157
has been cleaved in half, my lord.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.968
This is not the castle!

15:35.068 --> 15:37.404
What?

15:37.504 --> 15:41.475
Oh, look at this, my sire!

15:41.575 --> 15:44.311
It is Satanic!

15:44.411 --> 15:45.679
Ohh.

15:47.848 --> 15:52.486
This is Hell, and we are condemned souls.

15:52.586 --> 15:55.689
Come. We shall find the prince
of this netherworld...

15:55.789 --> 15:57.381
and beg his mercy.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.193
Wait for me, my lord!

16:02.929 --> 16:04.598
Dr. Brady, come quick.

16:04.698 --> 16:08.368
Two guys with swords and armor...

16:08.468 --> 16:10.837
Miller, you're always overreacting.

16:10.937 --> 16:12.773
Now, relax.

16:12.873 --> 16:14.608
There's absolutely no need to...

16:16.042 --> 16:18.311
Police are on their way.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.314
Peasant, please.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.316
Show me the way out of this prince castle!

16:23.416 --> 16:24.484
Yes!

16:24.584 --> 16:26.787
- Pee-yoo!
- Out this way.

16:26.887 --> 16:29.356
- They stink!
- Have a nice day.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.358
- Bye. Good luck.
- Wait!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.561
Peasant! Wait! Stop!

16:59.986 --> 17:02.887
What is this? The Gates of Hell!

17:04.124 --> 17:06.526
Look at its eyes of fire!

17:08.929 --> 17:11.832
Dragon! It's a red dragon!

17:11.932 --> 17:14.000
Attack!

17:14.099 --> 17:15.657
What the hell are you doing?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.763
Take that, beast!

17:41.461 --> 17:42.696
We have killed it!

17:42.796 --> 17:45.924
Ah, yes. It is no longer breathing.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.369
God is punishing us
for practicing the Black Arts.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.307
Let us pray for forgiveness.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.083
Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins.

18:03.183 --> 18:07.454
We are so, so, so, so, so... so sorry.

18:11.710 --> 18:14.895
- Dr. Brady?
- Ah, Julia. This is Julia Malfete...

18:14.995 --> 18:16.963
who heads up the Medieval Art department.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.566
She donated the famous
12th century castle exhibit.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.569
Julia designed the exhibit
where we found the two men.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.905
That stuff right there is
the result of the body search.

18:25.005 --> 18:27.974
The big guy had the gold coins...

18:28.074 --> 18:30.744
the sword, the shield, and that ring.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.380
The little guy had the salt pork...

18:33.480 --> 18:37.814
the sausage, the dagger...

18:39.052 --> 18:40.487
a molar.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.657
And that box... which he probably stole.

18:43.757 --> 18:45.358
Not from us.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.160
Most thieves take valuable things.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.962
They usually don't bring them.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.630
This is a Gothic pixis...

18:50.730 --> 18:53.099
the kind of design they were
making in Canterbury...

18:53.199 --> 18:54.367
at the end of the 12th century.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.369
It has emeralds and rubies.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.705
Why did the two men sleep here?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.206
They could've booked a suite at the Ritz.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.275
So, you said that you got
these out of their pockets?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.610
That's right.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.845
Except the sausage.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.848
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.610
This stamp ring is fantastic.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.722
My family's coat of arms.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.120
Sergeant, can I meet these thieves?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.194
Master, I'm hungry.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.029
My tummy rumbles like a beast.

19:23.129 --> 19:26.266
How can you think of food
after such tragedy?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.500
Yes.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.559
What I would not give
to see once more my precious...

19:33.006 --> 19:35.342
My lord! Look, she's alive!

19:35.442 --> 19:38.244
Rosalind. My fair Rosalind.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.982
My bride. My ravishing flower.

19:42.082 --> 19:44.117
Mistress! My mistress!

19:44.217 --> 19:45.352
What are you doing?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.754
It is a miracle. A miracle.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.022
Do I know you?

19:49.122 --> 19:51.124
Do you not recognize me, my lady?

19:51.224 --> 19:53.994
I am the Count of
Malfete and Papincourt...

19:54.094 --> 19:55.195
the Duke of Anjou.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.565
I am your faithful Thibault.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.066
You're who?

20:00.166 --> 20:04.337
And I am Andre le Pate,
valet of the count.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.173
Please, forgive me
for what I did to you...

20:07.273 --> 20:08.274
my dear Rosalind.

20:08.374 --> 20:12.412
My name isn't Rosalind. It's Julia.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.147
No! You are my Rosalind.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.884
The lock of hair you gave me
on our wedding day.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.554
I carry it over my heart.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.986
Please, my love, see for yourself.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.728
You see?

20:28.828 --> 20:32.232
It is the color of wheat
on a summer's day.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.527
The color of candlelight.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.136
It is your own.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.874
Stop this!

20:40.974 --> 20:42.575
- That's enough!
- Rosalind!

20:42.675 --> 20:44.277
You'll be safer outside!

20:44.377 --> 20:46.980
Do not leave me! Do not be afraid!

20:47.080 --> 20:49.607
You don't want to see this.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.386
Courage is our creed!

20:53.486 --> 20:56.122
Courage is our creed!

20:57.624 --> 20:59.717
Wait, stop! I know this man!

21:01.528 --> 21:03.430
"Courage is our creed."

21:03.530 --> 21:05.265
That's our family motto.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.333
This man is my cousin.

21:08.568 --> 21:12.739
It's in here.
You see, I thought he was dead.

21:12.839 --> 21:16.943
He disappeared when a storm...

21:17.043 --> 21:19.546
capsized his yacht
during the Admiral's Cup.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.681
They never recovered his body...

21:21.781 --> 21:24.217
so, of course, declared him dead.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.020
He was a very distant
French cousin of mine...

21:27.120 --> 21:30.623
but as the last living Malfete,
I inherited his estate.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.359
If he's your cousin,
what do you want me to do with him?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.427
Sire...

21:34.527 --> 21:38.098
Why does Lady Rosalind
call herself Julia...

21:38.198 --> 21:41.224
and allow us to be beaten and chained?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.110
Peasant...

21:50.210 --> 21:52.712
this is not our time.

21:52.812 --> 21:56.349
The wizard did not send us into the past.

21:56.449 --> 22:00.353
He sent us into the next millennium.

22:00.453 --> 22:05.625
We are thirty generations
removed from Malfete.

22:05.725 --> 22:09.729
Julia is not my beloved.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.499
She's my descendant.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.534
Descendant?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.136
Amber, it's Julia.

22:16.236 --> 22:18.898
Could you get me Hunter? It's important.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.707
That rabbit of yours
is on the phone again.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.215
Hey, bunny. What's up?

22:29.315 --> 22:31.417
Thibault Malfete
just showed up at the museum.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.286
Thibault Malfete?

22:33.386 --> 22:36.489
That's impossible.
Isn't he supposed to be...

22:36.589 --> 22:38.324
- I know.
- Are you sure it's him?

22:38.424 --> 22:39.726
He looks exactly like his photos.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.728
Hunter, he quoted the family motto.

22:41.828 --> 22:45.031
Does he know yet that
we're selling his entire estate?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.833
Well, it's hard to say what he knows.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.369
He's a little strange.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.371
Hunter, this is terrible.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.039
I mean, it's wonderful that he's alive...

22:53.139 --> 22:55.408
but it's terrible that
we started to sell the estate.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.410
Oh, God, I feel awful.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.778
The English courts declared him dead.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.446
We're well within our legal rights.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.882
How were we supposed to know
he was still alive?

23:02.982 --> 23:04.851
Has he mentioned anything about money?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.452
Money?

23:06.552 --> 23:08.755
How can you worry about money
at a time like this?

23:08.855 --> 23:10.256
No, I'm just worrying about you.

23:10.356 --> 23:13.726
You don't handle surprises well.
Where is your cousin now?

23:13.826 --> 23:16.863
He and this friend of his
are downstairs with security.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.731
Why don't we bring them
home with us tonight?

23:18.831 --> 23:21.568
He's family after all.
We want to be hospitable.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.036
You're wonderful.

23:23.136 --> 23:25.038
I'll pick you all up
in about five minutes.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.273
Love ya. Bye, bunny.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.840
Bye, big bear.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.313
Oh, my God.
Thibault Malfete's still alive.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.814
This is a disaster.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.849
Blah, blah, blah.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.320
You're pouting.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.055
I hate it when you call her bunny.

23:42.155 --> 23:44.824
You, my dear, are so much
hotter than a bunny.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.628
My God, look at yourself.
You're a tigress.

23:55.868 --> 23:59.305
Lady Julia, there has
been a terrible mistake.

23:59.405 --> 24:02.041
I'm so sorry. We thought you were dead.

24:02.141 --> 24:06.446
Dead? No, the wizard was a fool,
but not a killer.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.448
He only sent us the wrong way.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.449
Excuse me?

24:09.549 --> 24:11.751
We fell into the Mountain of Time.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.152
Wow.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.154
I must return to my time to prevent...

24:15.254 --> 24:16.856
a great tragedy to our family.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.058
I ask for your assistance.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.761
I'll do whatever I can.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.994
Ohh!

24:34.774 --> 24:36.025
- Awful.
- Ohh.

24:48.121 --> 24:50.180
Whoa!

24:52.859 --> 24:56.062
We must not go out!

24:56.162 --> 24:57.595
What... what are you doing?

25:01.968 --> 25:04.637
What are you doing?
No, we have to wait outside.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.473
Hunter can't park here.
We have to wait for him.

25:07.573 --> 25:09.142
Oh, my God.

25:09.242 --> 25:10.643
Bloody coward.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.377
We have to...

25:16.249 --> 25:18.410
Those boys are lost.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.289
I must go and retrieve them.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.656
Ah!

25:40.339 --> 25:41.670
Aah!

25:44.944 --> 25:47.013
This is England?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.514
- No...
- Meat!

25:48.614 --> 25:50.083
This is Chicago.

25:50.183 --> 25:52.352
Meat, meat, meat!

25:52.452 --> 25:53.753
This is the United States.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.089
Meat!

25:56.189 --> 25:58.691
The last I remember
was in Sussex, England...

25:58.791 --> 25:59.926
in my castle chambers.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.627
You don't remember anything since then?

26:01.727 --> 26:02.762
No.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.697
Do you think maybe you've suffered...

26:04.797 --> 26:06.766
some sort of memory loss
from the accident?

26:06.866 --> 26:10.303
Yes! After I drank the potion,
I remember nothing.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.504
- Onions?
- All of them!

26:11.604 --> 26:14.540
All right. You like to eat hot dogs, huh?

26:14.640 --> 26:16.909
I like to eat every kind of dog.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.144
Now, what are you doing?

26:18.244 --> 26:19.779
- Aargh!
- Leave the dogs!

26:19.879 --> 26:21.447
No, no, no. Stop it!

26:21.547 --> 26:22.448
Please, stop.

26:22.548 --> 26:25.051
I'm sorry, I'm so very sorry.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.786
He's French.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.751
Yeah. Very.

26:35.328 --> 26:36.262
Hi, honey.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.564
The situation's much worse than I thought.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.131
What are you talking about?

26:41.634 --> 26:43.336
Bonjour.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.506
Holy shit.

26:46.606 --> 26:51.344
Hunter, this is Thibault Malfete.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.013
Thibault, this is my fiancé, Hunter.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.148
Pleased to meet you.

26:55.248 --> 26:57.617
- Are you noble?
- No. Sorry.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.419
But I can certainly tell that you are.

26:59.519 --> 27:02.889
And this is Andre, Thibault's assistant.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.190
Hello, big nose.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.826
Run behind the chariot, peasant.

27:06.926 --> 27:07.827
Yes, master!

27:07.927 --> 27:09.829
He can't run behind the car.

27:09.929 --> 27:13.633
- He cannot ride. He's not noble.
- Yes, but he has to ride in the car.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.269
- He's very fast.
- We're taking the freeway.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.705
- You can run 70 miles an hour?
- I have good boots.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.542
No. You must sit in the car, please.

27:22.642 --> 27:25.111
- I am fast.
- I'm sure you are.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.646
I'd love to see you run sometime.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.078
- Obey.
- Yes, my lord.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.453
Do you want some dog?

27:45.431 --> 27:46.999
Too fast.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.735
Are you OK, Mr. Pate?

27:49.835 --> 27:53.072
Ohh. Too fast!

27:53.172 --> 27:55.608
Honey, could you slow down
just a little bit?

27:55.708 --> 27:57.410
I'm going 22 miles an hour.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.740
Yes, I know. Could you try going 21?

28:04.383 --> 28:07.019
Hey, what's the matter with you?

28:07.119 --> 28:08.254
You don't know how to drive?

28:08.354 --> 28:09.322
Go.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.283
What?

28:13.426 --> 28:15.261
It's gonna be fine.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.437
Oh, dear.

28:35.548 --> 28:38.217
Get in and open the door.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.785
Let's go inside.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.955
Hi, sweetie. Hello, Churchill.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.857
Hello. Come here. Give Mom a high-five.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.426
All right. That's my boy.

28:47.526 --> 28:48.427
Let's go.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.194
Like the hat.

28:56.736 --> 29:00.640
Angelique! I need you now!

29:00.740 --> 29:02.808
Come here, peasant.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.577
- Come now!
- OK, I'm coming.

29:04.677 --> 29:06.746
Hurry up.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.481
Ahh.

29:11.651 --> 29:13.642
How did you do that?

29:19.659 --> 29:20.793
Night.

29:23.115 --> 29:26.499
Day. Night. Day!

29:26.599 --> 29:29.101
I do not have this invention in my castle.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.303
You don't have power?

29:30.403 --> 29:32.972
I have the power to judge
and condemn to death...

29:33.072 --> 29:34.373
any villain on my land.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.776
Oh. Really?

29:36.876 --> 29:38.144
Hunter will be so jealous.

29:38.244 --> 29:43.015
I'm gonna get you two something to drink.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.252
Make Hunter one of
his power-dude smoothie things.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.453
I'd offer you one...

29:47.553 --> 29:50.328
but nobody seems to like them but him.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.631
Andre, could you please stop that?

29:58.731 --> 30:03.100
I'm just starting to feel
like I'm in a disco.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.374
My dear lady...

30:08.474 --> 30:10.876
you said you would
offer me your assistance.

30:10.976 --> 30:14.180
Oh, yes. Anything. What do you need?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.848
I need to find a wizard.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.184
Aah! Sorry, master. Sorry!

30:18.284 --> 30:19.318
- Sorry!
- Idiot!

30:19.418 --> 30:21.554
Apologize to the lady!

30:21.654 --> 30:23.155
Oops.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.224
Sorry, master. I ask for mercy.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.026
Forgive him, milady.

30:27.126 --> 30:30.563
It's OK. The floor needed
to be cleaned anyway.

30:30.663 --> 30:34.066
So, you were saying
something about what...

30:34.166 --> 30:35.368
should we say a wizard?

30:35.468 --> 30:38.104
I need to go back
into the tunnels of Time.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.193
Of course.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.246
I need to just understand
what has happened to you.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.082
Now, your yacht went down in a storm?

30:50.182 --> 30:51.717
No. You must listen.

30:51.817 --> 30:54.353
I am from the time of Thibault VI...

30:54.453 --> 30:57.857
and I have come to the future.

30:57.957 --> 31:03.195
OK. Tunnels of Time. Wizards. Thibault VI.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.887
Oops!

31:06.932 --> 31:07.833
Are you OK?

31:07.933 --> 31:09.798
Yes, lady.

31:11.604 --> 31:15.841
Lovely flower,
I see you do not believe me.

31:15.941 --> 31:20.571
It is a pity, but please... try.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.405
Oh.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.921
Yes. Of course I'll try.

31:29.021 --> 31:30.122
She's green.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.417
I never really did like the taste of this.

31:37.797 --> 31:39.899
Oh, my God. What happened?

31:39.999 --> 31:41.990
Nothing.

31:46.639 --> 31:48.708
I'm eating this very good meat...

31:48.808 --> 31:50.810
with vegetables in a fine sauce.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.945
I will shit easy tomorrow.

31:53.045 --> 31:56.382
It's jet lag.

31:56.482 --> 32:00.486
All right, I'm sure you would like to
wash your hands and whatever else.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.644
Why don't you come with me?

32:03.889 --> 32:04.947
All right. Here you go.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.795
Just gonna take this.

32:09.895 --> 32:13.296
Julia! Can I talk to you
for a moment, please?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.291
Don't be bashful with the soap.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.475
What is it, master? A throne?

32:22.575 --> 32:23.974
It could be.

32:25.411 --> 32:26.445
They're crazy!

32:26.545 --> 32:28.581
They have been through a terrible ordeal.

32:28.681 --> 32:29.749
They have amnesia.

32:29.849 --> 32:31.817
Amnesia? They're wacked!

32:31.917 --> 32:33.686
They're completely retarded.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.219
They're... Woo! You know?

32:44.697 --> 32:46.324
- Clean water.
- Ha ha!

32:53.706 --> 32:56.732
The long towel has a good fragrance.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.780
Thibault is my cousin, Hunter.
He's my family.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.615
Yeah? I'm not so sure.

33:02.715 --> 33:06.378
He doesn't strike me
as being particularly noble.

33:17.763 --> 33:20.533
Julia, come down here! It's an emergency.

33:20.633 --> 33:22.735
- Very good fountain.
- Yes.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.565
Your French relatives
are bathing in the toilet.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.297
Oh, my God.

33:37.883 --> 33:39.518
Toothbrushes.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.321
I'll just leave them right here.

33:42.421 --> 33:43.945
I'll be right back.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.598
I'm going to take a shower...

33:52.698 --> 33:54.433
then go tackle that kitchen.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.335
Hurry. Our dinner reservation's at 8:00.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.070
Oh! Where are we going?

33:58.170 --> 34:00.072
Latour.

34:00.172 --> 34:03.475
Isn't that just a little formal
for our guests?

34:03.575 --> 34:07.246
First you tell me your cousin's nobility
then you get mad at me when I suggest...

34:07.346 --> 34:09.248
that just maybe, he's not.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.117
Now you're upset because I pick
the best restaurant in town.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.454
You make it impossible for me
to do the right thing.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.857
No. You're right. Latour's gonna be great.

34:17.956 --> 34:21.092
Thank you, big bear.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.184
- I'll be in the shower.
- All right.

34:33.806 --> 34:36.706
Ah. Very good flavor.

34:39.011 --> 34:42.081
This is not wine, ignorant peasant.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.706
It is oil for the bath.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.753
Mmm. Very good perfume.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.172
Very creamy.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.274
Bathe, servant.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.777
No, my sire. I have
taken a bath at Christmas.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.445
- Bathe!
- No, no!

35:13.545 --> 35:16.916
I'm afraid! I don't want
to catch cold and die!

35:18.250 --> 35:21.086
Be silent, peasant!

35:21.186 --> 35:22.388
Ahh.

35:22.488 --> 35:26.425
Do you have another bottle
of this bathing oil for Andre?

35:26.525 --> 35:29.461
Do you realize the bath
you just took cost over $2,000?

35:29.561 --> 35:31.330
That's American dollars.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.598
Is that a lot?

35:32.698 --> 35:34.266
Yes, it is.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.937
Then I will repay you
with one of my swans.

35:38.037 --> 35:41.564
Oh, well. That sounds fair.

35:46.445 --> 35:52.247
My family tree. So many descendants.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.938
- Hello?
- Mr. Cassidy, please.

36:13.038 --> 36:16.008
Yeah. Hold on one second. Hunter?

36:16.108 --> 36:17.509
Yeah, bunny?

36:17.609 --> 36:18.877
Honey, it's your office.
Do you want to take it?

36:18.977 --> 36:21.639
- I'll take it upstairs.
- Oh, OK.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.184
Hello? Hello?

36:25.284 --> 36:26.185
Hello.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.252
Hello?

36:27.352 --> 36:28.354
Hello.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.389
Who is this?

36:30.489 --> 36:33.325
I'm Andre le Pate. I have big balls...

36:33.425 --> 36:36.095
and my ass breathes fire.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.063
Wow. That must hurt.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.065
- Hello.
- Hello?

36:40.165 --> 36:41.100
I told you never to call me here.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.334
Well, I forgot.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.037
- Hello! Enter!
- Somebody there with you?

36:47.673 --> 36:49.742
- Aah!
- Jesus!

36:49.842 --> 36:53.112
Hang up the damn phone,
or I'll call the police!

36:53.212 --> 36:55.848
I think he hung up the phone.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.951
It was Thibault's little
retarded homuncular assistant.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.419
Look, this is dangerous.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.680
I'll call you back
after Julia goes to bed, OK?

37:06.892 --> 37:08.826
Lady Julia.

37:11.130 --> 37:13.599
You are more than a rose.

37:13.699 --> 37:18.033
You are love's own flower.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.474
Come on. That's ridiculous.

37:22.574 --> 37:26.145
No, I just... This old thing,
I threw it on.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.780
I haven't worn it in a couple of years...

37:27.880 --> 37:32.340
but I guess I should learn
how to take a compliment.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.374
Thank you.

37:36.321 --> 37:37.310
Almost.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.093
Thank you.

37:41.193 --> 37:43.525
Much better.

37:45.998 --> 37:47.056
Kissing cousins.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.859
Ooh la la.

38:03.182 --> 38:04.883
I don't think
that I've ever seen anyone...

38:04.983 --> 38:08.646
eat a steak in two bites before.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.214
Ah.

38:16.929 --> 38:19.689
Thank you, master!

38:20.532 --> 38:22.468
Be blessed!

38:22.568 --> 38:24.160
I can assure you...

38:35.747 --> 38:36.815
Thank you!

38:36.915 --> 38:39.509
Like some more truffle sauce with that?

38:46.124 --> 38:49.128
Excuse me, but the gentleman...

38:49.228 --> 38:51.363
can't eat off the floor.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.233
He's not a gentleman. He's my servant...

38:54.333 --> 38:56.568
and he's not worthy of our company.

38:56.668 --> 38:57.903
Thank you.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.405
I'm truly sorry, sir.
Andre, would you please...

39:00.505 --> 39:03.408
No, no, milady. It is not possible.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.532
Please.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.981
Thibault, please, will you
let him sit at the table?

39:09.081 --> 39:10.139
For me?

39:12.217 --> 39:14.481
I will please you, lovely one.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.419
Obey, foolish wart.

39:25.464 --> 39:26.761
Thank you.

39:29.301 --> 39:33.237
And you were worried
they wouldn't be comfortable.

39:40.679 --> 39:44.583
Actually, the floor wasn't
such a bad place for him.

39:44.683 --> 39:45.984
Easier to hose down.

39:46.084 --> 39:49.019
Cheese! Very good cheese!

39:51.657 --> 39:52.791
Andre, what are you doing?

39:52.891 --> 39:55.394
What are you doing? Andre? No, no!

39:55.494 --> 39:58.730
- Andre, no.
- No. Bad!

39:58.830 --> 40:01.900
Hey. Sit down. Eat this.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.968
Hunter, could you...

40:08.974 --> 40:10.075
No. This is for dessert. All right?

40:10.175 --> 40:12.311
Please, sir, please.

40:12.411 --> 40:14.947
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

40:15.047 --> 40:17.983
Just add it to the check.
All right? Thank you.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.819
You eat this after dinner. All right?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.821
No, it's all right. I'm terribly sorry.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.556
Just add it to the bill. Thank you.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.021
All right.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.397
Do I have something on my face?

40:32.497 --> 40:36.235
You remind me of the daughter of a king.

40:36.335 --> 40:37.825
Thank you.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.574
On the subject
of Julia's noble ancestry...

40:42.674 --> 40:44.509
you do understand why she was
granted control of the estate?

40:44.609 --> 40:49.014
Julia is a Malfete.
Everything I have is hers.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.917
So you have no objection
if she retains control?

40:52.017 --> 40:54.086
- No.
- Wonderful.

40:54.186 --> 40:55.988
I'm sure you'll be
very pleased with our plans.

40:56.088 --> 40:57.689
They're going to make us...

40:57.789 --> 41:00.592
I mean you and Julia... very wealthy.

41:00.692 --> 41:04.329
I am already wealthy.
I own hundreds of horses...

41:04.429 --> 41:06.365
ten chests of pepper,
four hundred bags of wool...

41:06.465 --> 41:09.735
and fifty barrels of Spanish olives.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.136
And you own me, sire.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.672
Yes, but you have no value.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.332
That is true.

41:21.413 --> 41:22.505
Excuse you.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.053
Leave nothing for the devil!

41:28.153 --> 41:30.689
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did, sweetheart.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.025
They're not in very good health,
all right?

41:33.125 --> 41:36.161
So, just try to ignore it, if you can.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.330
- Sire.
- What?

41:38.430 --> 41:39.865
I want to make pee-pee.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.967
- Ah! You want to pee?
- Yes.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.068
Outside!

41:43.168 --> 41:44.970
Outside? But, sire...

41:45.070 --> 41:46.538
I could be eaten by the wolves.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.471
Find a torch! Idiot.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.903
Find a torch.

41:54.913 --> 41:57.609
Andre has such simple needs.
I think that's great.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.859
Need some help, sir?

42:26.211 --> 42:28.447
Oh, it is beautiful.

42:28.547 --> 42:31.083
The water comes out by itself. Ha!

42:37.255 --> 42:39.621
It is a magic fountain.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.496
Look at this! Mmm.

42:44.596 --> 42:47.432
It smells just like the forest.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.635
All the forest is in the small wheel.

42:50.735 --> 42:51.703
Mmm. Smell it!

42:51.803 --> 42:53.271
No. No, thank you.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.706
You don't want to smell it?

42:54.806 --> 42:56.205
Enjoy yourself.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.380
The castle's a wreck.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.048
So I'm helping her divide the estate up...

43:03.148 --> 43:05.217
into more manageable, profitable chunks.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.986
We're selling the art
and various high-end pieces...

43:08.086 --> 43:09.488
through an outlet here.

43:09.588 --> 43:11.990
Essentially, I'm protecting her.
I see that as my role.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.625
And the land?

43:13.725 --> 43:15.761
I decided we should sell that, too.

43:15.861 --> 43:17.329
It is not for you to decide.

43:17.429 --> 43:20.565
Only Lady Julia can say what will be done.

43:20.665 --> 43:23.368
I speak for both Julia and myself.

43:23.468 --> 43:25.971
You cannot possibly speak for a Malfete.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.973
What are your wishes, milady?

43:28.073 --> 43:31.109
Well, um...

43:31.209 --> 43:34.780
I guess I'd like to think about it...

43:34.880 --> 43:36.248
a little bit more, actually.

43:36.348 --> 43:37.749
Julia?

43:37.849 --> 43:39.510
The lady has spoken!

43:46.057 --> 43:47.492
Chicken salad, now!

43:47.592 --> 43:48.760
I want that cake. Come on now.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.350
Don't take all night.

44:00.038 --> 44:03.442
Greasy chicken.

44:03.542 --> 44:06.943
What on earth do you think you're doing?

44:12.150 --> 44:13.949
Hi, Andre.

44:21.059 --> 44:24.029
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to add an order...

44:24.129 --> 44:28.589
of chicken a la umbrella to your bill.

44:40.946 --> 44:43.048
Smell the forest.

44:43.148 --> 44:44.216
Yes, it's minty.

44:44.316 --> 44:46.685
It's from the blue fountain.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.810
Nice. Yeah. Oh, all right.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.757
Honey, would you like a mint?

44:52.857 --> 44:54.793
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.

44:54.893 --> 44:56.928
- Thibault?
- Master.

45:10.542 --> 45:13.712
Those are good. Give me another one.

45:13.812 --> 45:16.975
Yes. Very minty.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.371
Ow!

45:39.471 --> 45:40.639
Ah...

45:40.739 --> 45:43.542
Good evening, fine sir.

45:43.642 --> 45:45.610
I'm seeking Thibault of Malfete...

45:45.710 --> 45:49.669
the Duke of Anjou. The great chevalier?

45:58.556 --> 46:00.058
Andre does not need a bed.

46:00.158 --> 46:02.388
He will be happy with some straw.

46:03.561 --> 46:06.359
- Yes.
- We're out of straw.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.199
My bed is soft.

46:20.045 --> 46:21.780
It's time for the "Family Feud."

46:21.880 --> 46:23.214
Aah!

46:23.314 --> 46:26.518
Oh! Poor little people.
They're trapped inside!

46:26.618 --> 46:27.986
Oh!

46:28.086 --> 46:31.590
God have mercy. What are we
going to do, my sire?

46:31.690 --> 46:33.425
Free them.

46:33.525 --> 46:36.094
Chuck, Marilyn, Norma, Terry, and Linda.

46:36.194 --> 46:41.866
Now let's start the "Family Feud"!

46:41.966 --> 46:45.403
Bunny? You really think
these guys have amnesia?

46:45.503 --> 46:46.438
I don't know.

46:46.538 --> 46:48.733
We are coming!

46:52.243 --> 46:54.045
So you admit they're clinically insane?

46:54.145 --> 46:56.081
I didn't say that.

46:56.181 --> 46:57.816
Oh, come on!

46:59.718 --> 47:03.121
Where did they go, my lord?

47:12.063 --> 47:15.233
They were inside. We could not save them.

47:15.333 --> 47:16.534
It is tragic.

47:16.634 --> 47:19.704
Well, we never really
used this room anyway.

47:19.804 --> 47:21.139
It's a pity.

47:28.045 --> 47:29.414
Aah!

47:29.514 --> 47:31.416
I need to find a wizard now.

47:31.516 --> 47:33.484
Um...

47:33.584 --> 47:35.484
Do you mind if I get some coffee first?

47:40.324 --> 47:41.450
Hi.

47:43.995 --> 47:45.330
Jesus Christ!

47:45.430 --> 47:47.165
I've told you not to leave this stuff...

47:47.265 --> 47:48.933
in the middle of the driveway!
What are you trying to do?

47:49.033 --> 47:50.902
You just about broke my goddamn neck!

47:51.002 --> 47:52.737
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

47:52.837 --> 47:54.172
Do you actually do
any gardening around here...

47:54.272 --> 47:56.140
or do you just sing out of tune?

47:56.240 --> 47:57.709
Just clean it up!

47:57.809 --> 47:59.444
Aah!

47:59.544 --> 48:02.013
Oh! Hey, big belly!

48:02.113 --> 48:04.515
You dare to touch a lady?

48:04.615 --> 48:05.717
Who the hell are you?

48:05.817 --> 48:07.452
I'm Andre, and I piss on you.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.887
Yeah, well, you get the hell out of here
or I'm gonna call the cops.

48:09.987 --> 48:11.189
Apologize to the lady.

48:11.289 --> 48:14.559
Lady? You're calling her a...

48:14.659 --> 48:17.362
Lady. Right.

48:17.462 --> 48:19.430
I'm sorry.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.065
Kiss her feet.

48:21.165 --> 48:23.301
- Do what?
- Kiss her feet!

48:23.401 --> 48:24.936
Oh, Jesus!

48:25.036 --> 48:26.237
Instead of a wizard...

48:26.337 --> 48:28.973
I think what we really need
to find you is a good doctor.

48:29.073 --> 48:31.439
Wizards are the best doctors.

48:32.443 --> 48:34.545
What in the world is that?

48:34.645 --> 48:36.914
What are you doing?

48:37.014 --> 48:38.216
Call 911!

48:38.316 --> 48:39.717
What is going on here?

48:39.817 --> 48:42.820
He was very rude to the lady.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.256
Look, fool. A coat of arms.

48:45.356 --> 48:46.657
He is a nobleman.

48:46.757 --> 48:49.260
I did not know.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.261
Stupid peasant.

48:50.361 --> 48:52.997
- Who are these guys?
- Visitors.

48:53.097 --> 48:53.998
Do you own this woman?

48:54.098 --> 48:55.466
She works for me.

48:55.566 --> 48:58.102
Then I will hang my valet
by his feet on your behalf.

48:58.202 --> 48:59.270
No, please, my lord.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.773
Not by the feet! I prefer the thumbs.

49:01.873 --> 49:03.741
I got a meeting to catch.

49:03.841 --> 49:06.077
Rise, idiot.

49:06.177 --> 49:07.512
I give him to you for the day.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.514
You may beat him if you like.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.516
Thanks, but we just met.

49:11.616 --> 49:14.852
Thank you, my great and merciful master.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.955
Thank you, milord! Thank you!

49:18.055 --> 49:21.492
Let us go. We have a wizard to find.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.389
A wizard?

49:24.929 --> 49:26.431
- Are you French?
- Yes.

49:26.531 --> 49:29.100
- Do you like it here?
- It is very strange.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.436
It smells bad,
and the food is too little...

49:31.536 --> 49:33.805
but the ladies are wonderful.

49:33.905 --> 49:35.606
I wish my boss thought like that.

49:35.706 --> 49:38.976
Boss. Ha ha. Boss. What is boss?

49:39.076 --> 49:40.778
The guy you work for. The big guy.

49:40.878 --> 49:43.904
I can have his bones when he's eating.

49:45.449 --> 49:47.652
That is so disgusting.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.787
That's so gross.

49:49.887 --> 49:52.857
You have to figure out a way
to get away from him.

49:52.957 --> 49:55.827
He's my master. I don't want to be hung.

49:55.927 --> 49:56.894
Hung!

49:56.994 --> 49:58.095
You're not gonna be hung!

49:58.195 --> 50:01.032
That's completely against the law, OK?

50:01.132 --> 50:03.301
OK. OK!

50:03.401 --> 50:05.470
Yay!

50:05.570 --> 50:06.871
Does he pay a lot of money?

50:06.971 --> 50:10.875
Once every month he permits me
to hunt pheasants on his lands.

50:10.975 --> 50:12.743
So you make no money?

50:12.843 --> 50:15.243
I have a treasure.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.553
What do you call that again?

50:22.653 --> 50:24.856
The "L".

50:24.956 --> 50:25.857
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

50:25.957 --> 50:27.625
Before we get downstairs to the crowd...

50:27.725 --> 50:31.162
I've got this for you.
Here's my phone number.

50:31.262 --> 50:33.998
I want you to wear this
just in case you get lost.

50:34.098 --> 50:36.328
I will not get lost.

50:38.336 --> 50:41.305
You can only be lost
if you have no purpose...

50:41.405 --> 50:44.041
and I have purpose, which is to find a...

50:44.141 --> 50:46.077
A wizard. Right.

50:46.177 --> 50:48.980
I don't even know
where to start with that one.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.949
I mean, I have never met a wizard.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.352
I don't even think
they make wizards anymore.

50:54.452 --> 50:57.455
Oh! My purse! Wait, Thibault! Wait!

50:57.555 --> 50:59.123
Wait! No!

50:59.223 --> 51:01.526
- Take the purse!
- No! No!

51:01.626 --> 51:04.061
He's a thief. I have to cut his hand.

51:04.161 --> 51:05.429
No, no, no!

51:05.529 --> 51:06.898
Please, just take it.

51:06.998 --> 51:09.267
OK. Everything's fine now.

51:12.169 --> 51:13.304
Hang him in the public square.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.773
- Aah!
- Silence, old woman!

51:15.873 --> 51:17.041
You're not helping.

51:23.681 --> 51:26.650
Witch! Old witch! Wait!

51:27.918 --> 51:31.088
I am sorry. I thought you were an old hag.

51:31.188 --> 51:32.924
I've been called worse.

51:33.024 --> 51:34.958
Thibault, why don't
you come and tell her...

51:36.127 --> 51:37.651
Oh, no. Oh, no.

51:40.965 --> 51:43.525
Ah, would you happen to know a wizard?

51:44.702 --> 51:47.405
Can you tell me where to find a wizard?

51:47.505 --> 51:48.494
A wizard.

51:51.542 --> 51:53.032
Well.

52:19.737 --> 52:22.840
Peasants, which one of you
can show me to a wizard?

52:22.940 --> 52:24.609
There will be a reward.

52:24.709 --> 52:27.211
Sir Lancelot here's looking for a wizard.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.413
Aren't we all? Ha ha ha!

52:29.513 --> 52:31.082
I am not Lancelot.

52:31.182 --> 52:33.551
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete...

52:33.651 --> 52:35.953
Duke of Anjou, Baron of Orleans...

52:36.053 --> 52:37.521
Lord of Libourne.

52:37.621 --> 52:39.890
Yeah? Well, I'm Sid from Cicero...

52:39.990 --> 52:43.661
Duke of Hazzard, Baron of Billiards...

52:43.761 --> 52:46.964
and Lord of Lord-knows-what...

52:47.064 --> 52:50.668
and I challenge you to a duel.

52:50.768 --> 52:52.030
En garde!

52:54.505 --> 52:55.840
Do not make me kill you.

52:55.940 --> 52:58.743
En garde, I say. You watching this, honey?

53:02.046 --> 53:05.282
I should kill you for your insolence
but I am too thirsty...

53:05.382 --> 53:08.586
so instead, I will quench my thirst...

53:08.686 --> 53:10.721
and yours and yours.

53:15.826 --> 53:18.229
Drink up!

53:26.604 --> 53:27.905
Hey.

53:28.005 --> 53:29.740
You're not gonna believe a word of this.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.842
Not a word of it. Guess whose exhibit...

53:31.942 --> 53:34.011
had another visitor last night?

53:34.111 --> 53:36.614
There was sparks flying...

53:36.714 --> 53:38.382
and all sorts of weird noises.

53:38.482 --> 53:39.684
Then there was this poof.

53:39.784 --> 53:41.052
Poof.

53:41.152 --> 53:42.386
And a green flash,
and then bang, he was there.

53:42.486 --> 53:43.587
Who was there?

53:43.687 --> 53:46.691
- The wizard-looking dude.
- Wizard.

53:46.791 --> 53:47.892
Look.

53:47.992 --> 53:50.027
He burnt the bedspread where he came in.

53:50.127 --> 53:52.029
Absolutely shocking.

53:52.129 --> 53:54.865
Wait a minute.

53:54.965 --> 53:56.796
This wasn't here before.

54:13.551 --> 54:16.287
He says he's Julia's cousin.

54:16.387 --> 54:18.651
I say he's a fake.

54:21.192 --> 54:23.490
I want an answer in 24 hours.

54:28.833 --> 54:29.867
See, tiger?

54:29.967 --> 54:32.269
Daddy's gonna take care of this business.

54:32.369 --> 54:34.605
You gonna be nice to me again?

54:34.705 --> 54:36.107
Hello?

54:36.207 --> 54:39.276
- Hunter, you're not gonna believe this.
- Bunny, I'm right here.

54:39.376 --> 54:41.445
I lost Thibault because
he was looking for a wizard.

54:41.545 --> 54:43.581
And then he just freaked out...

54:43.681 --> 54:46.851
Nobody just loses a guy dressed
like a medieval knight in Chicago.

54:46.951 --> 54:51.088
Well, I did. Wait.
Hold on a second. Hello?

54:51.188 --> 54:54.792
Yeah, does anybody there know the Count
of whoop-de-do, the Baron of blah...

54:54.892 --> 54:56.494
Yes, I do.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.996
Wonderful. Thank you.

54:59.096 --> 55:00.431
All right, I found him. I gotta go.

55:00.531 --> 55:02.767
- I'm so relieved.
- Love you. Bye.

55:03.267 --> 55:04.668
So he's back, huh?

55:04.768 --> 55:08.272
Yeah. I was hoping
he'd tripped on his cape...

55:08.372 --> 55:11.375
and swan-dived into the Chicago River.

55:19.416 --> 55:20.651
Thibault!

55:20.751 --> 55:22.052
Thibault!

55:24.321 --> 55:26.056
Everybody, everybody!

55:26.156 --> 55:28.459
This is my great, great, great, great...

55:28.559 --> 55:31.862
great-granddaughter.

55:33.430 --> 55:38.335
Actually, grand, grand, grand,
grand, grandpa and I must go.

55:38.435 --> 55:39.737
No!

55:39.837 --> 55:41.205
You have to sing first!

55:41.305 --> 55:43.174
No, I don't...

55:43.274 --> 55:46.148
Yes. You must sing first.

55:55.886 --> 55:57.087
Oui, oui, oui

55:57.187 --> 55:58.989
Have to go, now, now, now

55:59.089 --> 56:00.491
Why?

56:00.591 --> 56:03.427
Yeah. You have to give us a good reason.

56:03.527 --> 56:04.695
I found a wizard.

56:04.795 --> 56:06.363
Well, bring him along!

56:06.463 --> 56:07.865
No, we have to go.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.455
I knew it!

56:10.868 --> 56:12.570
I must leave you now.

56:12.670 --> 56:14.905
Oh, no, no, no.

56:15.005 --> 56:16.907
So long, Lancelot.

56:17.007 --> 56:18.242
I am not Lancelot.

56:18.342 --> 56:20.511
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete.

56:22.780 --> 56:27.618
Of course it is that
bloody English wizard.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.620
He has followed me through time.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.488
Great. Great. I mean, he probably...

56:31.588 --> 56:34.158
just whipped up some
eye of newt potion thingie...

56:34.258 --> 56:36.193
and he waved his hands
over it a few times...

56:36.293 --> 56:39.330
and said some words in Latin, and voila!

56:39.430 --> 56:41.065
Thibault?

56:41.165 --> 56:43.000
I'm starting to believe you.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.468
I'm starting to believe everything...

56:44.568 --> 56:47.471
and that is a really big leap
for a 21st century girl.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.306
I just want you to appreciate that.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.307
OK?

56:50.407 --> 56:51.396
Mm-hmm.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.302
There it is.

56:56.914 --> 56:57.948
Oh, my God.

57:03.854 --> 57:06.049
All right. What now?

57:08.258 --> 57:11.386
- Ohh.
- Treacherous old fool!

57:13.530 --> 57:16.767
What is this?

57:16.867 --> 57:18.135
I thought you smote her dead.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.270
She's not my Rosalind.

57:19.370 --> 57:21.338
I'm Julia Malfete. Hi.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.507
Oh. Malfete!

57:23.607 --> 57:24.808
She's a descendant!

57:24.908 --> 57:27.845
Ah! All is not lost, my lord.

57:27.945 --> 57:30.114
How long until your magic is ready...

57:30.214 --> 57:32.416
to return me to my rightful time?

57:32.516 --> 57:34.318
Before the sun is set.

57:34.418 --> 57:38.081
Then let us go now and fetch
my faithful servant.

57:42.092 --> 57:43.827
Eww.

57:43.927 --> 57:46.096
Never smelled like this before.

57:57.441 --> 57:58.931
Ohh.

58:03.547 --> 58:05.282
Bloody English wizards.

58:05.382 --> 58:07.043
They cannot do anything right.

58:11.722 --> 58:13.557
Woo woo

58:13.657 --> 58:15.225
Ah, here we go

58:15.325 --> 58:16.656
Woo woo

58:18.862 --> 58:20.965
- I like your chariot.
- Thank you.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.501
That's my lipstick.

58:24.601 --> 58:28.339
Ohh, no, Andre. That's so gross.

58:28.439 --> 58:30.907
Hurry up. Spit it out the window.

58:31.675 --> 58:35.245
To business give them down and pay

58:35.998 --> 58:38.048
One ruby.

58:38.148 --> 58:40.048
That should do it.

58:45.589 --> 58:47.079
Hmm.

58:49.827 --> 58:51.662
25,000.

58:52.796 --> 58:54.127
Woo-hoo!

59:01.138 --> 59:02.506
What is all this horrible noise?

59:02.606 --> 59:05.074
We would love to go shopping.

59:15.986 --> 59:17.977
Oh, big swans!

59:25.329 --> 59:27.631
Oh! Very small chariots!

59:27.731 --> 59:30.367
Like little Matchbox cars.

59:30.467 --> 59:31.902
- Agh!
- Hey!

59:32.002 --> 59:32.903
Say cheese.

59:33.003 --> 59:34.265
Oh, ohh!

59:38.008 --> 59:39.977
I love these wheel cakes.

59:40.077 --> 59:42.546
Ha! We call them doughnuts.

59:42.646 --> 59:45.582
Andre, you can have as many
doughnuts as you want now.

59:45.682 --> 59:46.884
Mmm. Yes.

59:46.984 --> 59:50.054
You can have all of this, Andre.

59:50.154 --> 59:52.790
You could go out and get
a really big house.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.491
And you can have a swimming pool.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.727
You can have everything, Andre.

59:56.827 --> 59:59.730
I can only have what my master allows.

59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.799
That is not true!

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:05.769
This is a democracy. This is America.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:09.703
You are a free man.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.245
Thank you.

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.745
There are a lot of good things
about living in this time.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:20.417
You'll be OK here.

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:22.178
I'll make sure of it.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:25.622
You are lionhearted, Julia...

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:28.125
like the women of your lineage.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.493
You have courage.

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.597
Lionhearted. No.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.632
No, I don't think so.

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.859
Bunnyhearted maybe, but no.

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:41.438
Come outside.

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:44.006
You will learn to protect yourself.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:47.941
What are you doing?

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.803
Look at me.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.518
Take it like this.

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:56.848
Power in your arm.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:05.557
- Very impressive.
- Take it.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:10.165
Power in my arm.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:12.561
My arm!

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:18.430
- I can't do it. It's too heavy.
- Try again.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:56.046
I am getting so tired of this.
Sneaking around and lying all the time.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:57.670
Hey...

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:04.186
Hang in there with me, babe.
We are so close.

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:08.392
Take me dancing.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.120
Baby

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.442
Hey, watch it! Ah!

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.411
I'm sorry.

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:29.012
Look what you've done. Let's go, Kelly.

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:30.147
Come on.

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.149
Sorry about that. I'm sorry.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.151
Don't panic

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.819
Sorry, ma'am.

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:40.390
Don't help me. My boss will kill me.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.758
You're a free woman.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:45.262
Tonight... we dance!

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:47.297
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:48.832
Till the break of dawn

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.160
Hey

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:58.508
I dance the rumba

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:01.278
The salsa, the cha-cha, the limbo

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:04.014
The fox trot and even the tango

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:05.616
With ladies and girlies

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:07.718
With mommies and babies

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:09.586
And DJs gonna play this

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:11.455
'Cause it's on their playlist

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.090
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.992
The babes are all around me

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:16.760
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.062
Till the break of dawn

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.664
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:21.665
The babes are all around me

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:22.754
Oh, Hunter!

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.471
- Angelique.
- Where's Julia?

01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:30.040
Hunter! Get your groovin'!

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.875
Yah!

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.110
Who are you?

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.311
Who is she?

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:36.647
- She's my sister.
- I am not!

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:39.375
She's very tired now,
and she's gotta go home!

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.847
Sire Hunter!

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.862
Tonight was so great.

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:54.954
Greatest night ever in the world.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.249
You make me feel like a lady.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:15.419
But you are. A great lady.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.721
And you are a great man.

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:18.922
Really?

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.358
And if you got a decent haircut...

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.593
and learned not to put
everything you see...

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.695
in your mouth...

01:04:24.795 --> 01:04:27.364
I think you'd be a terrific man.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:29.455
Milady, thank you.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.536
Andre...

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:36.073
what do you say that we quit our lousy
jobs and go travel around the world?

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:38.075
- Quit?
- We could be so happy.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:41.111
Tonight, just tell your boss
that you quit, OK?

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.946
OK.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.881
- Be free.
- Free!

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.750
Because I am a free man!

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:49.045
You've got that right, baby!

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.625
Master. You are worried.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:56.827
What is wrong?

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.122
The wizard... he exploded.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:03.531
Yes. It wasn't a very pretty sight.

01:05:07.938 --> 01:05:09.599
The wizard exploded?

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:15.445
Well, I don't know about you guys...

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:17.180
but good night.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.648
But first...

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.184
Andre has something to say to Thibault.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.512
What is it, peasant?

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.390
Well, speak.

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.661
Nothing. I guess I was wrong.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.784
Thibault, he was standing by the river.

01:05:53.884 --> 01:05:57.821
The saddest, most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen.

01:05:57.921 --> 01:05:59.890
Hmm. Well...

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:02.788
that Thibault really is a special guy.

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.530
Yes. Yes, he is.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:10.867
That's why I've decided to give
the entire estate back to him.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.969
You what?

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:17.040
Honey, did you know
that the women of my lineage...

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.310
are all lionhearted?

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.248
They still haven't brought the stiff down?

01:06:25.348 --> 01:06:27.551
I heard somebody say
the old geezer's body parts...

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:28.879
are sticking to the ground.

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:44.098
Best I pull myself together.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.710
Come on, my little ones.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:16.458
Well, that feels better.

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.405
Can I come in?

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.040
What do you got?

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.076
Fingerprints don't match.

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:29.279
Whoever your friend is, he's
not this Thibault Malfete...

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.915
that died in that sailing
accident three years ago.

01:07:32.015 --> 01:07:33.505
I knew it.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.554
This is how
we're gonna sell it to the cops.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.092
OK, OK.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:43.360
- Ah, hello.
- Oh, my...

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.095
Well, don't look so astonished.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.696
It's magic.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.298
All I did was cast a little...

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.834
Oh. Good day, my lord.

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:55.666
- I do apologize...
- Damn wizard. This way.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.910
The trick with pork penis
is to chop it very fine.

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:06.616
Be careful.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:08.218
If you get that on you...

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.149
you'll grow fur.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.229
Peasant!

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.497
Peasant!

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.599
Get our things ready to go.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.502
Soon, we will be back
in our beloved homes.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:28.238
Master, my father is a drunkard.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.240
My mother is a hunchback.

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.943
My brother is a dwarf,
and my sister is a whore.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.312
I do not have any beloved home.

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:37.247
I don't want to go back with you.

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:40.250
I don't want anymore
to run behind your horse.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.053
I want to eat wheel cakes and doughnuts.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.854
And I want to have a chariot in iron.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.189
And exciting men's fashions...

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.492
direct from Europe at rock-bottom prices.

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:50.961
And I want to...

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.330
and... and I want...

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.966
and I want to stay here
with Lady Angelique.

01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:58.055
There you go.

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.804
And I want to be free!

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.701
I want to be cool and OK!

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.841
You are my property.

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:08.712
You will go back with me dead or alive.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:10.546
Choose quickly.

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:11.848
Thibault...

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:14.279
He only wants what we all want.

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.613
He belongs to me.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:20.657
I decide his fate.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:21.992
No, master.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.627
I mean, no way, Jose.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:27.185
Please, Thibault. It's the noble thing to do.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.636
Thank you, Thibault.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:35.671
Long life to your family.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:43.647
Yes. Lady Julia...

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:44.981
If you'll allow me...

01:09:45.081 --> 01:09:47.783
Sire Hunter's sister
left this last night...

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:49.319
in the house of the troubadour.

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:51.020
Sister? He d...

01:09:51.121 --> 01:09:53.223
Hunter doesn't have a sister.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.415
Thank you, Andre.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:56.926
Angelique!

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.567
I'm coming!

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.105
Hey! Who are you?

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.207
Stay here. I will go kill him for you.

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.243
No. I want to handle this myself.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.712
What are you doing in here?

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:16.846
What's this?

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.448
A 12th century English wizard.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.142
Can I talk to you
in the other room, please?

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:24.452
Don't touch anything.

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:28.849
What's this?

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.228
You offended the lady's honor.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:34.731
Prepare to die.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.200
Did you hear that? He threatened me!

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.703
And you're a witness.

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:42.205
You see? He's a violent criminal.

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:43.807
Thank God I called the police.

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:45.475
You called the police?

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.111
Julia, this man's a fraud.

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:50.080
All he wants is the money.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.375
No, Hunter, all you want is the money.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:54.751
It's over.

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:57.141
What?

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:01.752
You couldn't make it
through one day without me.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.151
Ah, come on.

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:08.465
You're my little bunny.

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:10.633
Bunny?

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.435
Do I look like a bunny to you?

01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:13.937
No.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.138
Do I look like a bunny to you?

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:16.306
Nay.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:19.776
You know what, Hunter?
I don't look like a bunny.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.611
I don't act like a bunny.

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:23.146
I don't think like a bunny.

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:24.848
And if you loved me...

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.983
you wouldn't have made me
try to feel like a bunny.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:28.852
I am strong, and I am smart...

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.020
and I don't need you to take care of me.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.314
Oh, really?

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.960
Courage is my creed.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.294
Are you insane?

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:39.329
No.

01:11:39.429 --> 01:11:40.589
Put that thing away.

01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:43.793
You're right. I should.

01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:51.706
Aah!

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:55.587
And stay out!

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.584
My lord. Remind you of anyone?

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:09.058
All units, be on the lookout
for a heavily-armed dangerous male...

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.827
with kidnap victim female.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.395
Use extreme caution.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.257
Go, gentlemen.

01:12:16.299 --> 01:12:18.767
Don't be afraid to use your guns.

01:12:25.041 --> 01:12:26.242
We should check the kitchen.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:29.913
Taxi? Museum of Fine Arts, please.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.004
And quickly, or off with your head.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.584
Hey! They're getting away!

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:35.685
Chief...

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:36.911
I'm going after 'em!

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.626
Where are y'all from?

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:44.961
The lady's from here.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.832
The wizard and I are
from the 12th century.

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:50.099
Don't lose 'em, O'Malley.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.827
We're right behind you! You stay here.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.510
If we get caught,
I will verify to the police...

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:02.178
that you are a hostage, OK?

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:05.281
All right. Now we talkin'. Hold on.

01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:17.527
Can we go back in time from here?

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.494
We have to go through the same
chamber from whence we came.

01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:24.794
Good going, O'Malley.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:31.662
- Unh!
- Hey!

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:39.637
Damn.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:45.772
Roadblocks established,
State and Michigan.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:19.643
He's getting away!

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:32.164
I've never ridden the "L"
quite like this before.

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:38.037
A big guy in a metal hat with a blonde?

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:41.678
Oh, man, they're already out of here.

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:43.846
Aerial unit 2.

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:46.176
Suspects headed south on Michigan.

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:09.100
Suspects entering museum.

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:26.389
Look, the knight is in his home.

01:15:26.489 --> 01:15:28.057
Welcome, knight.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:29.592
Say hello to the knight.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:30.893
Hello, knight.

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.428
Please, wait, one second.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:36.099
I'm sorry, folks, but this
exhibit is closed for today...

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.533
so you'll have to move on.

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.464
Thank you. Thank you.

01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:45.008
Shh.

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:48.511
What am I gonna do without you?

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:52.015
You're my knight in shining armor.

01:15:52.115 --> 01:15:56.552
Soon you will find
a wonderful man to marry.

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:59.555
You will make a long life together.

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.714
I had the vision of this.

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.722
You are so charming.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.386
I am so proud of you.

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:13.102
And...

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:16.069
when your children are
big enough to understand...

01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:21.544
I want you to tell them
about an old ancestor...

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:26.249
because I am a part of you, and one day...

01:16:26.349 --> 01:16:28.544
I will be a part of your children.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.252
Here.

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:45.768
A present from your great,
great, great, great-grandmother.

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.238
Wait.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.669
Here.

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:55.777
Will you give this to her for me?

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:01.172
I will.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:03.886
I promise she'll be the only girl...

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.578
with anything like this.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:10.048
Thank you.

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:13.362
Thank you.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.952
Your Grace...

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:22.939
Aah.

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:24.774
What are they doing?

01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.577
They're drinking vitamins, obviously.

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:29.612
Per Horus...

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:33.239
Invictus ducere!

01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:50.024
Where is he? The guy with all the armor?

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:53.027
He's gone.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.030
- Where?
- Home.

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.688
One moment!

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.196
Please.

01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:55.264
My dear Earl of Warwick...

01:18:55.364 --> 01:18:58.134
in celebration of this happy occasion...

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:01.804
I want to dismiss forever
our disagreements.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:05.271
Please, drink of our wine.

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:10.780
You shall accept
this peace offering, Warwick.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.781
I command you.

01:19:21.991 --> 01:19:23.159
Wait!

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:29.732
Ah!

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.735
What in heaven's wrong with Warwick?

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:34.203
He did not like the wine.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:37.873
If he preferred white,
he should have said so.

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:46.281
It has been so long since I saw you...

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.783
When have we been apart, my lord?

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:49.518
When I was with the Lady Julia.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:50.586
Lady Julia.

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:53.522
She bade me to deliver you this...

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.850
wedding gift.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.484
Here.

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:05.401
It is an odd piece, isn't it?

01:20:05.501 --> 01:20:08.334
It is before its time.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:16.612
That's what I'm saying. Literally,
she threw me out of the house...

01:20:16.712 --> 01:20:19.376
and took off with the idiots. Animals.

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:23.686
Ugh.

01:20:23.786 --> 01:20:25.221
They poisoned my shake!

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.889
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.224
They left some kind of note here.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.693
- Some old French parchment.
- Well, what does it say?

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:32.695
I don't know, Amber. I don't speak French.

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:34.563
Per Horus et per Ra...

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.097
invictus ducere.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.001
Ah!

01:20:39.101 --> 01:20:41.504
Oh, my God. Hunter? Are you OK?

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.141
Oh!

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:46.606
Hunter?

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:51.674
Hunter, Hunter, OK, talk to me! Hunter!

01:20:58.254 --> 01:21:01.090
- Stay away from me!
- Aah!

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.559
Who are you people? Don't touch me!

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:11.167
I am a close and personal friend
of the chief of police.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:12.268
I am the chief of police!

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:15.338
You'll make a great servant for the count.

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:16.939
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.028
Ow!

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.106
I must tell you
that all of us at the firm...

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:54.243
are delighted with your decision
to keep the estate intact.

01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:57.613
I can't wait to get really
acquainted with this place.

01:21:57.713 --> 01:21:59.281
We'll go over everything.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:01.384
I can even show you the dungeon.

01:22:01.484 --> 01:22:02.918
Unless you're afraid.

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:05.254
She's not afraid.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:07.845
Courage is her creed.

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:11.927
How do you know my family's creed?

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.995
I know a lot about your family.

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:19.835
Miss Malfete, this is Francois le Combier.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.138
He's the attorney
handling the French interest...

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:23.706
in the estate.

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:27.343
He knows the history of the
castle even better than I do.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.245
Francois, perhaps you would like...

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:32.014
to be Miss Malfete's guide today?

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:34.049
It will be my great pleasure.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.251
Mademoiselle.

01:22:35.351 --> 01:22:38.120
Merci.

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.690
So let them say your hair's too long

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.058
'Cause I don't care

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:46.362
With you I can't go wrong...

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.197
I have one small worry.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.665
What's that?

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:51.434
Who's going to protect me from the devil?

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:53.335
Ha ha ha!

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.638
You got me, don't ya?

01:22:55.738 --> 01:22:58.040
Yes! I got you, babe.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.375
You got me, babe.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.377
Yeah. I got you, babe!

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:03.279
I got you, babe

01:23:04.013 --> 01:23:05.807
I got you, babe

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:08.910
I got you, babe

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:16.325
I got you, babe

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:20.156
Your time will come

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:31.472
Your time will come

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:37.313
Have you been a fool
opposed to the groove?

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:40.916
And have you been a slave to the rhythm?

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:44.920
You've been abused, forgotten, and used

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.591
Made quite a few bad decisions

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:52.361
Don't let this happen to you, baby

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:54.029
Look to yourself

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:58.067
See that there is no limit
to what you can do

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.302
Get it right

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:03.973
Just keep on singin'

01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:07.409
La di da di da

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:11.447

La di da di da di da

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:18.721
Just hold your head up

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:22.658
Yeah, what's done is done

01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:26.529
The hands are turnin'

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:32.167
I know somehow, some way

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:38.695
Your time will come

01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:47.480
Your time will come, yeah

01:24:52.488 --> 01:24:56.358
Lost in the silence,
don't turn to violence

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.795
Make no mistake, there's a heaven

01:24:59.895 --> 01:25:03.799
Waiting to greet you, longing to meet you

01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:07.336
Don't worry, your time has come

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.172
I'll go the distance with you

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:13.075
Only one thing I'm asking

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:16.912
One little task that I want you to do

01:25:17.012 --> 01:25:20.883
It's true, it's true,
it's true, it's true, it's true

01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:24.553
Just keep on singin'

La di da di da di da

01:25:34.997 --> 01:25:39.101

Yeah, what's done is done

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:43.606
Yeah, yeah

The hands are turnin'

01:25:47.009 --> 01:25:52.915
I know somehow, some way

01:25:53.015 --> 01:25:56.585

Your time will come, yeah
