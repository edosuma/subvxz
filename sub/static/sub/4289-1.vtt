00:52.012 --> 00:54.503
Most people think of themselves
as individuals,

00:54.681 --> 00:56.763
that there's no-one
on the planet like them.

00:56.934 --> 00:58.925
This thought motivates them
to get out of bed,

00:59.102 --> 01:01.514
eat food, and walk around
like nothing's wrong.

01:01.688 --> 01:04.179
My name is Oliver Tate.

01:06.777 --> 01:08.859
♪ ALEX TURNER: Stuck On The Puzzle

01:28.549 --> 01:34.886
♪ I'm not the kind of fool
who's gonna sit and sing to you

01:36.098 --> 01:39.932

01:54.449 --> 01:57.566
"What kind of young person am I?"

01:57.744 --> 02:00.360
That's the challenge.
We talk about challenges.

02:00.539 --> 02:03.497
Well, that's the challenge
I'm giving you this term.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.623
A gauntlet, so to speak.

02:05.794 --> 02:08.830
But this gauntlet is
also an opportunity.

02:09.006 --> 02:12.373
An opportunity for self-discovery.

02:12.551 --> 02:15.543
What do I mean by "self-discovery"?
Mark Pritchard?

02:16.305 --> 02:18.842
Having a wank, sir?

02:19.933 --> 02:22.299
Discovery of the self.

02:22.477 --> 02:24.342
Who am I?

02:24.521 --> 02:26.807
I find that the only way
to get through life

02:26.982 --> 02:30.474
is to picture myself
in an entirely disconnected reality.

02:31.153 --> 02:33.565
I often imagine
how people would react to my death.

02:35.157 --> 02:39.116
Mr Dunthorne's quavering voice
as he makes the announcement.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.782
The shocked faces of my classmates.

02:44.374 --> 02:47.241
A playground bedecked with flowers.

02:48.253 --> 02:51.120
The empty stillness
of a school corridor.

02:52.382 --> 02:53.792
Local news analysis.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.754
Oliver Tate was a popular
and much-loved pupil.

02:56.928 --> 03:00.796
Many of the people I've spoken to here
referred to him as an example.

03:00.974 --> 03:03.090
He was so funny and so smart.

03:03.268 --> 03:05.884
He's gonna be really missed.
It's so bad. He's so young.

03:06.063 --> 03:07.599
Tear-streaked tributes.

03:10.859 --> 03:14.693
I just wanted to hug him.
I just wish I had.

03:14.863 --> 03:19.027
I wish I could have said goodbye,
but I never said anything to him.

03:19.201 --> 03:21.112
The steady stoicism of my parents.

03:21.286 --> 03:23.823
All the girls liked him.

03:24.873 --> 03:27.285
Other boys respected him,
looked up to him, I guess.

03:27.459 --> 03:28.539
Candlelit vigils.

03:28.710 --> 03:34.250
We are witnessing incredible,
unprecedented scenes of quiet devotion.

03:34.424 --> 03:39.794
Behind me a vigil that's been repeated
all over the country,

03:39.971 --> 03:44.214
A testimony to the love felt
for Oliver Tate

03:44.393 --> 03:47.351
and the loss felt by his friends...

03:47.521 --> 03:51.935
and, frankly, by Wales on the whole.

03:53.026 --> 03:55.392
And, finally, my glorious resurrection.

03:57.989 --> 04:01.026
Don't ask how. Just know
that I'm now more powerful than ever.

04:05.622 --> 04:07.658
Let's get off.

04:28.061 --> 04:30.097
Zoe.

04:30.272 --> 04:33.230
Zoe, this is for you. It's yours.
It has your name on it. Take it.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.140
- It's not mine.
- Please take it.

04:35.318 --> 04:38.276
That note seems fascinating,
Oliver Tate.

04:38.447 --> 04:40.779
You know the rules.
Stand up and read it out.

04:40.949 --> 04:44.862
I can't. It's Zoe's.
She gave it to me and I was gonna...

04:47.038 --> 04:49.996
Saved by the bell once again, Mr Tate.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.577
All right, take your time.

04:51.752 --> 04:55.370
I know you're all gagging
to get to double Biology but don't rush.

05:12.731 --> 05:16.895
Jordana Bevan's only real flaws
are her sporadic bouts of eczema.

05:17.694 --> 05:19.650
Other than that, she has many qualities.

05:20.405 --> 05:23.067
She never speaks about herself.
She could be anything.

05:23.241 --> 05:25.152
Perhaps she's a Fabian.

05:25.327 --> 05:28.319
That would make her a socialist
who advocates gradual change.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.414
She's moderately unpopular, which
makes a romance between us more likely.

05:33.585 --> 05:36.748
She's also a girl - to be seen with her
would improve my street cred,

05:36.922 --> 05:38.662
which, though high, could be higher.

05:46.264 --> 05:48.255
Lastly, she's now single,

05:48.433 --> 05:51.925
cos Mark Pritchard cheated on her
with Abby Smuts at the school disco.

05:52.103 --> 05:56.016
The full extent of the betrayal
is still the subject of speculation.

05:58.610 --> 06:01.443
Chips knows there's
nothing more attractive than a bully.

06:01.613 --> 06:03.820
He also knows that Zoe Preece
is a legitimate target

06:03.990 --> 06:07.027
because she's overweight
and won't accept notes in class.

06:08.537 --> 06:10.778
Essentially, I disapprove of bullying.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.697
Jordana seems to enjoy it in moderation.

06:15.627 --> 06:18.664
I must not let my principles
stand in the way of progress.

06:18.839 --> 06:20.955
I must be willing to adapt.

06:24.386 --> 06:25.842
Keep up, Tubs!

06:28.515 --> 06:30.506
This was the correct decision.

06:31.518 --> 06:33.099
Give it back now!

06:33.270 --> 06:36.888
This was a vivid memory of youth that I
would cherish when I was old and frail.

06:37.065 --> 06:38.225
Oh!

06:38.400 --> 06:40.140
Catch. Straight into the hands.

06:40.318 --> 06:43.651
We were working as a team,
testing each other's limits,

06:43.822 --> 06:47.485
challenging one another's bourgeois
assumptions of what was acceptable.

06:47.659 --> 06:49.820
Oh, grow up! Grow up!

06:50.495 --> 06:53.828
I knew that these events - although
hard to bear at this precise moment -

06:53.999 --> 06:57.162
would help build Zoe Preece's
character in the long term.

07:11.683 --> 07:12.798
Aargh!

07:20.609 --> 07:22.600
Wanker!

07:31.286 --> 07:32.867
Honestly, Zoe, it was an accident.

07:33.038 --> 07:36.405
I mean, it was just unlucky that
you were there and that you fell in.

07:36.583 --> 07:40.201
We were playing...sort of like a game.

07:41.671 --> 07:44.162
And you can replace the stuff
that was in your bag.

07:44.341 --> 07:47.424
- I'm not saying it's cheap...
- Fuck off and die!

07:54.601 --> 07:56.887
In many ways, I prefer my own company.

07:57.062 --> 07:58.893
It gives me time to think.

07:59.064 --> 08:02.727
I suppose it's a bit of an affectation,
but I often read the dictionary.

08:02.901 --> 08:07.019
My word for today is "flagitious",
which means wickedly shameful.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.911
I live in a large house with my parents.

08:21.086 --> 08:23.828
They tell me that our area
has breathtaking scenery.

08:25.924 --> 08:28.085
I'm not sure I believe in scenery.

08:29.678 --> 08:32.294
However, the views allow me
to spy on our new neighbours.

08:32.472 --> 08:35.589
I don't know them yet but they
seem like terrible human beings.

08:39.354 --> 08:41.015
Ninjas.

08:45.110 --> 08:47.772
My parents have not had sex
for seven months.

08:48.446 --> 08:51.779
I've been monitoring their intimacy
via the dimmer switch in their bedroom.

08:51.950 --> 08:55.738
I know when they've been at it
because the dial will be set to halfway.

09:04.004 --> 09:07.246
I wish life could be more like
American soap operas.

09:07.424 --> 09:09.585
Then, whenever things got dramatic,

09:09.759 --> 09:13.547
you could just fade the picture down
and pick things up again later.

09:17.767 --> 09:21.635
Can you tell your mother to hurry up?
I'll be waiting in the road.

09:24.691 --> 09:27.273
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

09:27.444 --> 09:30.186
Yeah, you look good for your age.
For a mum.

09:32.907 --> 09:34.863
Mum's getting the bus.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.868
So... I inherited it all.

09:38.038 --> 09:41.997
Well, er, it's been terrific.
Small world, all that.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.032
It's such a lovely area.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.667
This used to be
Jill's grandmother's house, right?

09:46.838 --> 09:48.829
Yes.

09:49.007 --> 09:52.920
The hours we spent up in that room,
listening to records, hatching plans.

09:53.094 --> 09:55.961
Right, yes.
So are you going to be selling up?

09:56.139 --> 09:58.505
Just gonna let things
take their own path.

09:59.851 --> 10:02.137
- You have a good day, Lloyd.
- OK, cheers, Graham.

10:02.312 --> 10:04.177
- Give my love to Jill.
- Will do.

10:04.355 --> 10:06.346
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Goodbye.

10:16.493 --> 10:18.404
- You go get 'em, killer.
- I will.

10:19.204 --> 10:21.946
As usual,
Dad drops me 800 yards from school.

10:22.123 --> 10:25.866
That way, I can slip in unnoticed,
like a torpedo.

10:26.044 --> 10:27.875
Watch your step, motherfucker! Ha-ha

10:28.046 --> 10:30.788
You've got to wake up.
How many times have I told you?

10:30.965 --> 10:32.705
- Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

10:32.884 --> 10:34.545
- Griffiths?
- Here, sir.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.084
- Harris?
- Yes, sir.

10:36.262 --> 10:37.752
- Davies?
- Yes, sir.

10:37.931 --> 10:39.546
- Morris?
- Sir.

10:39.724 --> 10:41.089
Preece?

10:41.267 --> 10:43.804
Preece? Anyone seen Zoe?

10:45.647 --> 10:48.013
- Tate?
- Yeah, present.

10:48.191 --> 10:50.182
- Pritchard?
- Yes.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.816
Smuts?

10:58.952 --> 11:00.567
Wanker!

11:00.745 --> 11:03.077
Zoe Preece hasn't been
in school for a while,

11:03.248 --> 11:07.241
so I've written a pamphlet
on how to break out of the victim cycle.

11:08.711 --> 11:11.453
I've also given her two examples
to inspire her.

11:11.631 --> 11:13.167
Firstly, Rhydian Bird,

11:13.341 --> 11:16.253
who pulled his trousers down to fart
and followed through,

11:16.427 --> 11:19.009
calling an unhealthy turd
onto the tarmac.

11:19.180 --> 11:23.298
But instead of looking embarrassed,
he screamed with laughter and pointed.

11:23.476 --> 11:25.842
Nobody could tease him about it
cos he was so proud.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.726
How do you even know all men read poems?

11:27.897 --> 11:30.138
All men do, unless you're gay.
Are you gay?

11:30.316 --> 11:32.773
Secondly, Chips.
He wasn't even considered hot

11:32.944 --> 11:36.232
until the Watkins twins stabbed him
in the back with compasses.

11:36.406 --> 11:38.647
He said nothing, showed no discomfort

11:38.825 --> 11:41.111
as his shirt blossomed
with blood poppies.

11:41.286 --> 11:44.699
His stoicism reminded me of the brave
men who died in the First World War.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.196
Chips is an outstanding bully.

11:47.375 --> 11:50.959
He once made our Religious Education
teacher cry using only Blu-Tack.

11:51.129 --> 11:52.744
Right, now, now, now.

11:56.176 --> 11:57.791
I don't quite know what I am yet.

11:57.969 --> 11:59.925
I've tried smoking a pipe...

12:00.096 --> 12:01.757
., flipping coins...

12:01.931 --> 12:04.593
listening exclusively
to French crooners.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.554
Other times I go to the beach
and stare at the sea.

12:07.729 --> 12:10.516
Someone made a documentary
about a prominent thinker

12:10.690 --> 12:12.646
who struggled with unspeakable loss.

12:12.817 --> 12:15.854
I've even had a brief hat phase.
But nothing stuck.

12:27.373 --> 12:28.988
- Gene.
- What?

12:29.167 --> 12:31.158
The most secure route
to Zoe is big Gene,

12:31.336 --> 12:34.954
who, over the last few months, has
become her only friend and confidante.

12:35.131 --> 12:37.042
Gene told me that Zoe had moved schools.

12:37.217 --> 12:39.483
She was very unhappy
because she was bullied

12:39.485 --> 12:41.426
and one boy even pushed her into a pond.

12:41.596 --> 12:43.427
Oh... I had no idea.

12:43.598 --> 12:46.635
I persuaded her to give Zoe the pamphlet
by saying it was a love letter.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.219
It's a big love letter.

12:48.394 --> 12:50.305
I've got a big heart.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.472
Sometimes I wish there was a film crew
following my every move.

12:53.650 --> 12:56.733
I imagine the camera craning up
as I walk away.

12:56.903 --> 12:58.564
But, unless things improve,

12:58.738 --> 13:02.777
the biopic of my life will only have
the budget for a zoom out.

13:18.007 --> 13:20.043
I feel bad, cutting into his head.

13:20.218 --> 13:21.879
Why? It's just a fucking frog.

13:22.053 --> 13:23.918
It's still a thing, though. It had life.

13:24.097 --> 13:26.053
Where do you think they get the frogs?

13:26.224 --> 13:28.306
I don't know.
Probably a lake or a river nearby.

13:28.476 --> 13:30.842
They probably have a guy that does it.
I could find out.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.102
- I don't actually want to know.
- Neither do I.

13:33.273 --> 13:35.889
- I'm just saying. You asked...
- I wonder where Fat is.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.147
- Zoe?
- Mm.

13:37.318 --> 13:40.276
- She hasn't been in school for a while.
- I hadn't noticed.

13:40.446 --> 13:42.528
I thought you would have.
She leaves a big gap.

13:42.699 --> 13:44.064
She's not on my radar.

13:44.242 --> 13:46.904
- Is it cos we pushed her into the pond?
- I didn't push her.

13:47.078 --> 13:50.411
- Think she's weeping herself to death?
- I didn't push her.

13:50.581 --> 13:52.196
Maybe you should write to her.

13:53.084 --> 13:55.416
Maybe you should write her
a pamphlet or something.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.076
What do you think?

13:57.797 --> 13:59.253
What is this?

13:59.966 --> 14:01.422
What do you want from me?

14:01.592 --> 14:05.176
Meet me under the railway bridge after
school and we'll take it from there.

14:07.432 --> 14:09.798
Bring a Polaroid camera and a diary.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.099
OK?

14:29.620 --> 14:32.327
- Got the camera and the diary?
- Do you have the pamphlet?

14:32.498 --> 14:34.614
Give me the camera.

14:41.132 --> 14:43.123
OK.

14:47.513 --> 14:48.969
Now kneel down.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.973
Please, Jordana... What is this?

14:52.143 --> 14:54.350
Kneel down.

15:00.485 --> 15:01.975
Close your eyes.

15:20.171 --> 15:22.332
We kissed until our lips felt swollen.

15:22.507 --> 15:26.170
Her mouth tasted of milk, Polo mints
and Dunhill International.

15:37.188 --> 15:40.851
OK. Now take out the diary
and write today's date.

15:47.198 --> 15:50.031
Write a few paragraphs on how excited
you are to have kissed me.

15:50.201 --> 15:53.693
Mention what a dick Mark Pritchard is
and slag off Abby Sluts.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.453
- It's Smuts.
- Let's call her Sluts.

15:56.624 --> 15:59.366
I sit next to her in Geography,
so we're mates.

15:59.544 --> 16:01.500
I don't need your life story.

16:04.549 --> 16:07.712
Wow. You look mentally retarded.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.625
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

16:11.305 --> 16:14.547
I had in fact only kissed
one person before - Zoe Preece.

16:14.725 --> 16:17.842
It was after the Cowboys And Indians
school disco.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.057
I told her if we were going to do it,
we had to hide behind the refectory.

16:21.232 --> 16:23.393
Her tongue was blue
from blackcurrant squash.

16:23.568 --> 16:25.433
It smouldered in the cold.

16:26.404 --> 16:27.894
OK, I've done it.

16:33.953 --> 16:34.988
Good.

16:35.163 --> 16:37.028
- Can I have the pamphlet now?
- No.

16:37.206 --> 16:40.573
- What will you do with the photos?
- Leave them lying around school.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.582
For people to accidentally find.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.118
Oh.

16:44.297 --> 16:45.833
What are you complaining about?

16:46.007 --> 16:48.714
This is conclusive proof
that you might not be gay.

16:48.885 --> 16:51.843
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

16:52.013 --> 16:55.096
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

16:57.268 --> 16:59.884
Come on, gay boy, take back
what you said about me!

17:00.062 --> 17:01.723
I take it back. I take it back.

17:01.898 --> 17:04.605
And admit that you're in fact a gaylord.

17:06.861 --> 17:08.817
No. Do not admit it.

17:08.988 --> 17:11.400
- Do not admit that.
- Shut up, Chips.

17:11.574 --> 17:13.609
Fine. I'm gay, I'm very gay.

17:16.996 --> 17:18.702
And Jordana's a slut.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.446
- Jordana is a slut.
- No.

17:21.626 --> 17:23.116
Say it. Say it!

17:23.294 --> 17:24.909
No.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.954
Don't be a dick, Mark. Just let him go.

17:31.010 --> 17:33.126
Fine. I'll let him go.

17:34.180 --> 17:36.045
I'll let him go.

17:36.224 --> 17:39.091
lf...he admits you're a slut.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.133
- Ooh.
- Just say it, gay boy.

17:41.312 --> 17:43.177
Say it.

17:54.492 --> 17:58.610
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Fucking big gay.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.827
I was completely overbalanced.

18:04.001 --> 18:07.619
It was luck, I'm gonna get him for this.
I'll bring him so much pain.

18:07.797 --> 18:10.163
Probably catch him like he caught me,
on the sly.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.795
Blood.

18:16.055 --> 18:18.842
- Are you gonna get up now?
- Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.282
- You've got scaly hands.
- It's eczema.

19:18.868 --> 19:21.359
Now that we had kissed
for non-blackmail purposes,

19:21.537 --> 19:24.529
I thought it gentlemanly
to escort Jordana home.

19:24.707 --> 19:28.074
When there, I asked if
she was my girlfriend now. And she said:

19:28.252 --> 19:30.243
I'll think about it.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.205
But what she meant was, yes.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.916
We are now as one.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.651
Whenever I'm late home from school,

19:56.822 --> 20:00.030
my mother assumes I've been abducted
and left to drown in a lake.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.651
There he is. Oliver?

20:03.412 --> 20:05.698
My mother is worried
that I have mental problems.

20:05.873 --> 20:08.285
I found a book about
teenage paranoid delusions

20:08.459 --> 20:11.041
during a routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

20:11.212 --> 20:14.420
After that, I started slipping
choice phrases into our conversation.

20:14.590 --> 20:17.502
My body has been replaced by a shell.
My organs are made of stone.

20:17.677 --> 20:19.508
- I've been dead for years.
- Right.

20:19.679 --> 20:21.612
My mother is naturally neurotic

20:21.801 --> 20:23.988
and in her youth even dreamed
of being an actress.

20:24.058 --> 20:28.051
Until she was told by a speech therapist
her tongue was too big for her mouth.

20:28.229 --> 20:32.518
Now she works for the council's Legal
and Democratic Services department.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.356
One of the rules in her office

20:38.531 --> 20:40.522
- is that if it's your birthday...
- Ta-da.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.316
..you are held responsible
for bringing your own cake to work.

20:43.494 --> 20:45.530
- Happy birthday, Jill.
- Thank you.

20:47.456 --> 20:48.741
Oliver?

20:48.916 --> 20:50.781
Oliver, come here.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.496
Come here.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.328
Where are you going, Oliver?

20:59.093 --> 21:00.879
OK, sit up.

21:04.181 --> 21:07.765
- Are you being victimised again?
- No. I'm never victimised.

21:07.935 --> 21:09.550
You were, in primary school and Cubs.

21:09.729 --> 21:11.845
- I don't remember.
- I do. There was a lot of crying.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.808
- Is it drug related?
- How?

21:13.983 --> 21:15.848
- I don't know. You tell me.
- It's not.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.891
- Your pupils are huge.
- It's dark.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.857
- Is it self-harm?
- Why would I punch myself in the eye?

21:21.031 --> 21:23.773
- I really don't know.
- I wouldn't. This is stupid.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.818
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

21:28.748 --> 21:30.613
OK, I got into a fight.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.203
I was defending the honour
of my girlfriend.

21:33.377 --> 21:34.833
OK, fine.

21:35.004 --> 21:36.960
You're not being serious, it's fine.

21:37.131 --> 21:38.996
No, I am. I have a girlfriend now.

21:39.175 --> 21:41.040
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:41.218 --> 21:42.628
- Do you?
- Yeah.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.259
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.295
Of course.

21:46.474 --> 21:48.806
Yes, of course. I mean,
why wouldn't... I didn't...

21:48.976 --> 21:51.888
- Did you think I was...
- No, I didn't. Come here.

21:58.611 --> 22:01.318
What a lovely little chat.
You're doing so well.

22:19.298 --> 22:20.253
So?

22:20.424 --> 22:22.289
K-nock, k-nock, can I come in?

22:22.468 --> 22:24.959
This was the happiest
I'd seen my father for years.

22:26.096 --> 22:29.338
Not too long ago, I discovered
an empty bottle of anti-depressants,

22:29.517 --> 22:32.133
during another routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

22:32.311 --> 22:35.348
My research indicates it all started
when he was sacked from his job

22:35.523 --> 22:37.434
presenting on the Open University.

22:37.608 --> 22:39.473
My father is a marine biologist,

22:39.652 --> 22:42.610
and introduced a segment
called Mysteries Of The Deep.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.645
But he was an uneasy screen presence

22:44.824 --> 22:47.406
and never knew quite what to do
with his hands.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.823
After his dismissal,
he spent several days in bed,

22:51.997 --> 22:54.830
drinking hot lemon from the same mug
and never washing it,

22:55.000 --> 22:56.956
a key sign of one of his downturns.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.209
Now he works at the local university,

22:59.380 --> 23:01.336
doing a job he finds
difficult to explain

23:01.507 --> 23:04.499
to anyone without
a degree-level knowledge of fish.

23:08.389 --> 23:10.254
Listen, I hope you don't mind.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.344
But your mother informs me
that you have a girlfriend.

23:13.519 --> 23:15.851
Is there anything
I can help you with there?

23:16.021 --> 23:17.761
I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.521
OK. All right.

23:19.692 --> 23:21.523
Yes. Er...listen...

23:21.694 --> 23:24.185
I know you think I'm very boring,
you know.

23:25.281 --> 23:29.650
But once... I ripped my vest off
in front of a woman

23:30.411 --> 23:33.073
and er...it was very effective,
actually.

23:33.247 --> 23:34.202
I know.

23:34.373 --> 23:36.705
It produced a very atavistic response.

23:36.876 --> 23:39.037
That's just something to bear in mind.

23:40.546 --> 23:44.334
And listen,
I made you a cassette recording.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.756
It's a compilation of songs
I used to listen to

23:48.135 --> 23:50.382
during some
of my early formative relationships.

23:50.556 --> 23:52.717
Plus a couple of things
I thought you might dig.

23:52.892 --> 23:56.225
I think music can make things seem
a bit more real, sometimes,

23:56.395 --> 23:58.181
- if you know what I mean.
- Thanks.

23:58.355 --> 24:02.292
I've also included some break-up songs
towards the end,

24:02.357 --> 24:04.769
just in case things don't work out.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.280
Which, obviously, you know,
that isn't the aim,

24:07.458 --> 24:09.713
though, I'm gonna tell you,
it is likely.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.191
Passion rarely lasts, I'm afraid.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.651
All right, well...

24:14.830 --> 24:17.663
good night and erm...well done!

24:17.833 --> 24:20.540
It's an achievement.
It really is, of sorts.

24:20.711 --> 24:21.791

humiliating teachers
and bullying the weak.

26:07.109 --> 26:10.601

Two weeks. It's fucking ridiculous!

27:49.795 --> 27:51.786
I'm not bothered.
We've as good as done it.

27:51.964 --> 27:54.956
Never take more than a week between
everything but and stuffing it in.

27:55.134 --> 27:56.965
She's taking the piss.
Keiron, back me up.

27:57.136 --> 27:59.047
- She's taking the piss, man.
- Thank you.

27:59.221 --> 28:01.212
Watch out, she's looking.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.383
Is she still looking?

28:06.562 --> 28:08.143
Yep.

28:09.356 --> 28:12.348
Jordana hates any place
that could be termed romantic.

28:12.526 --> 28:15.768
With this in mind, I took her to
one of my favourite industrial estates,

28:15.946 --> 28:17.937
for some quality one-on-one time.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.990
This is nice, isn't it?

28:30.460 --> 28:32.325
Yeah, it's not bad.

28:32.504 --> 28:35.166
I mean, you know, we get on pretty well.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.166
JORDANA: 

28:39.344 --> 28:41.630
And we're getting more
and more intimate.

28:41.805 --> 28:42.840
Intimate?

28:43.015 --> 28:46.178
Yeah, you know, we've done things.
We've been intimate.

28:47.186 --> 28:49.177
We have been intimate, yeah.

28:52.024 --> 28:54.436
My parents are going to the cinema
on Thursday,

28:54.610 --> 28:57.352
It's a tradition.
They go every Thursday evening.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.520
So what I'm saying is, it's empty.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.697
The house. On Thursday.
The house is empty.

29:02.868 --> 29:05.109
On Thursday evening,
it's an empty house.

29:05.287 --> 29:07.152
So what do you think?

29:07.331 --> 29:10.118
Are you asking me to come round
and have sex with you?

29:10.292 --> 29:13.455
If I say yes, does that lessen
the chance of you wanting to?

29:13.629 --> 29:16.416
Before I answer that,
I just want to check one thing.

29:16.590 --> 29:19.047
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- It's quite serious.

29:19.218 --> 29:23.211
Of course, yeah. Go ahead, you should
be able to ask what you want to ask.

29:24.223 --> 29:25.884
Will the house be empty?

29:30.729 --> 29:32.720
Write down the reasons why I should.

29:46.912 --> 29:47.901
OK.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.908
It's Thursday. You're going to
the cinema? You should leave.

29:54.086 --> 29:55.917
Is that what you wear to lounge around?

29:56.088 --> 29:58.249
Your father doesn't want to go out
all of a sudden.

29:58.423 --> 30:01.506
I've been looking forward to it.
I didn't realise there'd be others.

30:01.677 --> 30:04.089
- They're our neighbours.
- Who, the ninjas?

30:04.263 --> 30:06.845
It's Thursday, our cinema night.
It's not a free-for-all.

30:07.015 --> 30:09.597
Do not call them ninjas, Oliver.
It's racist.

30:09.768 --> 30:10.928
He's white.

30:11.103 --> 30:13.264
They don't strike me
as big Eric Rohmer fans.

30:13.438 --> 30:16.601
Why don't the three of you just go
and see some tat at the Odeon?

30:16.775 --> 30:18.515
- I'll just stay in.
- You should both go.

30:18.694 --> 30:20.685
So rude, Lloyd.

30:23.282 --> 30:25.273
Oh, for God's sake.

30:35.168 --> 30:37.033
- Oh, Graham.
- Whoa!

30:37.212 --> 30:39.123
- Oh, not really...
- Hey.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.129
Oh, thanks.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.291
Are you all right?

30:44.344 --> 30:45.800
Whoargh!

30:45.971 --> 30:47.211
You look lovely.

30:47.389 --> 30:49.801
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry I'm a bit early.

30:49.975 --> 30:53.638
It's just, there's a fantastic
noodle bar right next to the cinema.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.144
Kim-Lin and I would love to take
you and Lloyd, ..

30:56.315 --> 30:58.146
- Ninjas.
- My treat.

30:58.317 --> 31:00.808
- Very sweet.
- No need to take two cars, right?

31:00.986 --> 31:02.476
Plenty of room in the van.

31:02.654 --> 31:05.145
Do you mind jumping in the back,
here, Lloyd?

31:07.993 --> 31:10.735
Hop right in there,
make yourself comfortable.

31:12.289 --> 31:14.280
All right there, buddy? Great.

32:29.282 --> 32:31.273
Thanks for living up a fucking hill.

32:33.453 --> 32:36.365
Sorry, I had to er...go to the toilet.

32:37.082 --> 32:39.073
I'm OK now. It doesn't matter.

32:40.252 --> 32:42.664
Just gonna top this up quickly.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.496
There we go.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.674
To us, and a wonderful evening
of lovemaking.

32:53.265 --> 32:54.880
Can you just get off my shoulders?

32:55.058 --> 32:57.049
I'm just directing you, just...

32:58.103 --> 33:01.721
Right, OK, just don't open them.
I'll tell you when. Stay there.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.311
- What, now?
- Yeah.

33:10.323 --> 33:12.439
Fucking hell, you're a serial killer.

33:13.410 --> 33:16.368
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't know whether you'd like it.

33:16.538 --> 33:18.824
But we can learn from it.
I've learned from it.

33:18.999 --> 33:22.162
I think you've learned from it.
Maybe we could start again.

33:22.335 --> 33:25.122
- I've gotta go home.
- OK, cool. You should go home.

33:25.297 --> 33:29.381
I'll give you this. It's just a letter
I was gonna give you. Just take it.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.542
It's nothing.

33:32.637 --> 33:34.548
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, I... Yeah...

33:34.723 --> 33:36.714
- You...
- OK, bye.

33:51.364 --> 33:54.356
Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me
explore your perfect body.

33:54.534 --> 33:55.649
I could drink your blood.

33:55.827 --> 33:58.990
You're the only person I would allow
to be shrunk to microscopic size

33:59.164 --> 34:01.405
and swim inside me
in a tiny submersible machine.

34:01.583 --> 34:04.325
We've lost our virginity
but it wasn't like losing anything.

34:04.503 --> 34:08.667
You're too good for me. You're too good
for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.083
Don't get cocky.

35:09.526 --> 35:11.187
How was the film?

35:11.361 --> 35:12.692
I'm going to bed.

35:12.862 --> 35:15.399
It's nice to see something lightweight
once in a while,

35:15.574 --> 35:17.030
that you don't have to think about.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.031
Relationships are tough, aren't they?

35:19.744 --> 35:21.735
You should be in bed, Oliver.

35:25.834 --> 35:29.247
Tonight, I stumbled across
an encyclopaedia entry on ultrasound.

35:29.421 --> 35:33.209
Ultrasound is a sound vibration
too high frequency to be audible.

35:33.383 --> 35:36.125
It was first developed to locate
submerged objects -

35:36.303 --> 35:40.091
submarines, depth charges,
Atlantis and such.

35:40.265 --> 35:42.221
Some animals, like bats,
dolphins and dogs

35:42.392 --> 35:44.724
can hear within the
ultrasonic frequency.

35:44.894 --> 35:46.885
But no human can.

35:47.063 --> 35:49.725
No-one can truly know
what anyone thinks or feels.

35:49.899 --> 35:51.890
What's inside Mum?

35:52.611 --> 35:53.976
What's inside Dad?

35:55.238 --> 35:56.899
What's inside Jordana?

35:58.700 --> 36:01.487
We're all travelling under the radar,
undetected.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.652
And no-one can do a thing about it.

36:04.205 --> 36:07.288
- Any more word from Graham?
- Nothing to report, Jackie.

36:07.459 --> 36:10.121
- We went to the cinema as normal.
- How did that go?

36:10.295 --> 36:11.535
Awkward, of course.

36:11.713 --> 36:14.295
Lloyd sulked
because we watched Crocodile Dundee

36:14.466 --> 36:17.128
rather than one of his dark numbers,
I don't know.

36:17.302 --> 36:20.169
But I really laughed.
I thought it was very charming.

36:20.347 --> 36:23.931
And I could see why someone like her
would go for someone like him.

36:24.100 --> 36:27.558
Graham is still very attractive.
He probably felt threatened.

36:27.729 --> 36:30.687
Lloyd is far too self-involved
to feel threatened, Jackie.

36:30.857 --> 36:32.722
He knows Graham was your first love...

36:32.901 --> 36:34.766
- He wasn't my first love.
- Come on.

36:34.944 --> 36:36.309
- I was 18.
- Pardon?

36:36.488 --> 36:38.854
18. Look, I've got to go.
I'll call you back.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.114
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow, OK.

36:43.495 --> 36:45.110
Lloyd?

36:45.955 --> 36:47.820
Were you listening in to that?

36:47.999 --> 36:49.864
Sorry, what?

36:50.043 --> 36:52.329
I could hear you breathe, Lloyd.

36:58.426 --> 37:01.509
Why hadn't my parents told me
that Graham was Mum's first love?

37:01.680 --> 37:04.968
No wonder their cinema outing
had ended in such a schism.

37:05.141 --> 37:07.883
I can only assume the subject
of wife-swapping was raised

37:08.061 --> 37:09.972
and Dad didn't feel emotionally ready.

37:10.897 --> 37:13.183
Is it possible that
Mum would cheat on Dad?

37:13.983 --> 37:15.268
Will they get divorced?

37:15.443 --> 37:16.649
They don't even row.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.811
They just have discussions.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.651
I'm going to have to
increase my surveillance.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.721
Good night, Oliver.

38:44.949 --> 38:46.940
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

38:48.286 --> 38:50.277
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

38:50.747 --> 38:51.987
Yargh!

39:07.138 --> 39:09.129
Thank you very much, Jeff.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.766
I got you these books.
They're really meaningful to me.

39:12.936 --> 39:16.053
This is Shakespeare's most mature work,
miles better than Hamlet.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.937
Just more developed thematically.

39:18.107 --> 39:21.816
And this is Nietzsche, one of the most
influential philosophers of modern time.

39:21.986 --> 39:24.978
I don't agree with all he says
but he makes some interesting points.

39:25.156 --> 39:28.740
And this is The Catcher In The Rye,
a great modern American novel.

39:28.910 --> 39:30.775
Salinger's very influential.

39:30.954 --> 39:32.410
Why are you doing this?

39:32.580 --> 39:36.118
I thought it'd be nice to get some
mutual interest, now we've had sex,

39:36.292 --> 39:38.578
other than spitting
and setting things on fire.

39:38.753 --> 39:40.618
Why would I want to be more like you?

39:40.797 --> 39:42.958
Just try not to crack the spines
or burn them.

39:43.132 --> 39:46.624
We should get in. It starts in an hour.
I want to get a good seat.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.421
It's rude to leave a film
before it's finished.

39:51.599 --> 39:52.839
- Who to?
- The film-makers.

39:53.017 --> 39:54.382
- How do they know?
- They just do.

39:54.561 --> 39:56.176
- How?
- They do.

39:56.354 --> 39:59.471
- There wasn't even any sound on it.
- There was never intended to be.

39:59.649 --> 40:01.765
- Then why did they write it?
- Kiss me.

40:02.652 --> 40:04.233
Get off me!

40:04.988 --> 40:07.354
- What are you doing?
- Just kiss me.

40:07.532 --> 40:09.739
Get the fuck off me, you freak.

40:14.831 --> 40:16.662
That was fucking ridiculous.

40:16.833 --> 40:18.243
"Kiss me!" Who says that?

40:18.418 --> 40:21.080
- It was a kiss. I tried to be romantic.
- What the fuck?

40:21.254 --> 40:23.711
- You were crushing my face.
- Yeah, in a romantic way.

40:23.882 --> 40:25.338
I'm not in the mood.

40:27.343 --> 40:30.085
It seems pretty clear
that Mum is having an affair.

40:30.263 --> 40:33.630
Why else would she be at the
hairdresser's with Graham the ninja?

40:33.808 --> 40:36.390
He probably makes sure
all his prospective sex partners

40:36.561 --> 40:39.769
are salon fresh before impregnating
them with a ninja love child.

40:39.939 --> 40:40.644
Cheers.

40:40.815 --> 40:44.273
Mum normally just gets a trim
from her work colleague Jackie.

40:44.861 --> 40:48.024
But now I think of it,
she did mention her hair the other day.

40:48.990 --> 40:50.855
I used to have long hair like her.

40:51.034 --> 40:51.864
Hm?

40:52.035 --> 40:53.900
I used to have long hair, remember?

40:54.078 --> 40:55.943
Hm, yes.

40:56.122 --> 40:59.080
- Pretty, isn't she?
- I dunno.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.241
Do you like my hair long?

41:01.878 --> 41:03.869
- Er...
- Or short like now?

41:05.006 --> 41:08.419
Well, you know... I like your hair
no matter how long it is.

41:08.593 --> 41:10.254
But did you prefer it long?

41:10.428 --> 41:11.793
Either way's good.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.256
No opinion.

41:13.431 --> 41:15.296
Well, it's up to you.

41:15.475 --> 41:18.012
So it wouldn't bother you
if I shaved it all off?

41:18.186 --> 41:19.551
Not if it made you happy.

41:19.729 --> 41:21.765
If you want to shave off your hair,
you should.

41:21.940 --> 41:25.057
Why would I shave my hair off, Lloyd?
What a stupid idea.

41:26.819 --> 41:28.150
Yeah.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.738
I can imagine my mum calmly leaving
one day while Dad helps her pack.

41:34.410 --> 41:36.275
So er...got any plans?

41:36.454 --> 41:38.319
No, not really.

41:38.498 --> 41:40.363
No, just...

41:40.541 --> 41:42.532
see how it goes, really.

42:15.201 --> 42:17.567
Are you planning
on getting dressed today?

42:17.745 --> 42:20.202
- Do you want to take the car?
- That's fine.

42:20.373 --> 42:23.957
I'm going to work from home today
so if you want to take the car...

42:25.753 --> 42:28.540
I was planning on going to see
one of Graham's talks tonight.

42:28.715 --> 42:30.080
- OK.
- You don't mind?

42:30.258 --> 42:33.000
- Why would I mind?
- It just means I won't be in tonight.

42:33.177 --> 42:36.044
- I'll make sure I keep myself busy.
- Oliver, you coming?

42:36.222 --> 42:38.588
- I'd like a moment with my father.
- Lovely.

42:38.766 --> 42:40.757
I'll see you in the car.

42:45.606 --> 42:47.562
I think Mum might be having an affair.

42:47.734 --> 42:49.725
Can you turn the tap off, please?

42:51.195 --> 42:54.528
I saw her in town with Graham and heard
her on the phone talking about him.

42:54.699 --> 42:56.360
You shouldn't be spying on people.

42:56.534 --> 42:59.822
I just saw them and accidentally
picked up the phone. Aren't you worried?

42:59.996 --> 43:02.328
- Graham's an old friend of Mum's.
- They've met up.

43:02.498 --> 43:04.329
- Yes.
- So you're condoning this affair?

43:04.500 --> 43:07.833
There is no affair. He's just
some bloke I stole your mother from.

43:08.004 --> 43:10.290
So you admit they have a history?

43:10.465 --> 43:12.922
I think you should
go to your mother now, OK?

43:18.473 --> 43:20.429
- Thanks, Mum.
- Just a second, we're early.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.883
- How are things with Jordana?
- Fine.

43:24.062 --> 43:26.150
- You ever going to let us meet her?
- I Don't think so.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.801
Maybe if you get a terminal illness.

43:28.024 --> 43:30.015
So things are serious between you two?

43:30.193 --> 43:32.177
It may seem like a big deal now

43:32.180 --> 43:34.154
but it probably won't matter
when you're my age.

43:34.246 --> 43:36.051
- What? 38?
- Just be careful.

43:36.162 --> 43:38.064
- I always use condoms.
- Good.

43:38.242 --> 43:41.826
You know that your dad and I
are going through a bit of a tough time.

43:41.996 --> 43:45.329
And I want you to know
we really appreciate you trying to help.

43:45.500 --> 43:48.242
- I'm not trying to help.
- You're a loud whisperer.

43:48.419 --> 43:50.284
You shouldn't spy on people.

43:50.463 --> 43:52.328
Why have you been meeting Graham?

43:52.507 --> 43:56.466
Graham is an old friend and has had
relationship problems with Kim-Lin.

43:56.636 --> 43:58.501
He needed someone he could talk to.

43:58.679 --> 44:01.386
- So he might be single soon?
- Goodbye, Oliver.

44:06.270 --> 44:07.305
- Mum?
- Yes?

44:07.480 --> 44:08.890
Who would you save first in a fire,

44:09.065 --> 44:12.603
given the hypothetical situation that
Dad and I were equally hard to save?

44:13.236 --> 44:15.693
I'd go for you but I'd feel bad
for your father.

44:15.863 --> 44:17.728
OK.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.745
- Kiss me!
- What?

44:35.925 --> 44:38.132
I still can't believe you
fucking said it.

44:38.302 --> 44:41.169
I did not say it in a high-pitched...
like a little mouse.

44:41.347 --> 44:43.429
- You cried it.
- Come on, we're late.

44:46.602 --> 44:49.514
- That gap gets smaller every day.
- What are you doing tonight?

44:49.689 --> 44:51.350
I'm busy tonight.

44:51.524 --> 44:52.934
Doing what?

44:53.109 --> 44:54.770
As in, I've got stuff to do. Busy.

44:54.944 --> 44:57.651
No, you never have anything to do.
What are you doing?

44:58.698 --> 45:00.689
What is light?

45:01.450 --> 45:02.940
What is light?

45:04.745 --> 45:07.612
How important is light?

45:09.041 --> 45:11.123
OK, let's think about that for a minute.

45:11.294 --> 45:15.628
Cos it seems very basic and banal
but it's not. It's loaded.

45:15.798 --> 45:17.504
It's a bloody nail bomb.

45:18.384 --> 45:23.174
I think light is probably
the most important gift we have

45:23.347 --> 45:25.212
from the universe.

45:25.391 --> 45:28.679
And if you asked any intelligent
bloody writer,

45:29.478 --> 45:32.811
like Professor Hawking or anybody
of that ilk,

45:34.192 --> 45:36.183
he could talk to you...

45:36.736 --> 45:40.570
for about, I don't know, a year...

45:40.740 --> 45:42.901
just about bloody light!

45:43.492 --> 45:46.984
We don't want to be in the dark,

45:47.163 --> 45:48.903
being fiddled with.

45:49.081 --> 45:50.946
That's for sure.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.990
How's my dad meant to compete?

45:53.169 --> 45:55.034
The only time I saw him enthral a room

45:55.213 --> 45:58.831
was when he gave a talk about
the disappearance of a giant sturgeon.

45:59.050 --> 46:01.883
Sturgeons are royal fish,
since the 14th century,

46:02.053 --> 46:04.385
and, if caught,
they do become property of the Crown.

46:04.555 --> 46:07.388
So, yes, we're treating the matter
as suspicious.

46:09.644 --> 46:11.430
How deep is the ocean?

46:11.604 --> 46:15.938
Seven miles at its deepest point, but
on average, six miles as a rule of thumb.

46:16.484 --> 46:18.349
But no fish could live down there.

46:18.527 --> 46:21.894
There's no light, of course,
and the pressure is far too great.

46:22.073 --> 46:24.564
Any human who found themselves
at that level,

46:24.742 --> 46:26.607
well, they would die immediately.

46:26.786 --> 46:29.528
They would implode.
They wouldn't stand a chance.

46:29.705 --> 46:31.570
But in answer to your question,

46:31.749 --> 46:34.206
the ocean is six miles deep.

46:37.588 --> 46:39.419
I am a prism.

46:39.590 --> 46:41.581
That's not mad.

46:42.260 --> 46:45.172
OK? I am a prism, I am light.

46:45.888 --> 46:47.879
I am lucid.

46:48.474 --> 46:50.715
I am exciting and delicious.

46:50.893 --> 46:53.179
Thanks very much for today.
You've been fantastic.

47:07.618 --> 47:08.778
Well done.

47:08.953 --> 47:11.285
- It seemed to go pretty well.
- Oh, yes, yes.

47:11.455 --> 47:13.320
I think they...

47:13.499 --> 47:15.956
- They loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

47:16.127 --> 47:17.788
Absolutely.

47:18.421 --> 47:19.957
A lot to take in.

47:20.131 --> 47:21.996
- But it was silly, right?
- No, no.

47:22.174 --> 47:24.085
- You think I'm silly?
- No, I don't.

47:24.260 --> 47:26.842
- It's OK.
- I don't. I don't.

47:27.680 --> 47:29.671
I didn't ask for this, Jill.

47:30.474 --> 47:33.637
This gift, it's ...
It's like a burden to me.

47:33.811 --> 47:34.675
Sure.

47:34.854 --> 47:37.220
Yeah, you must be exhausted.

47:39.942 --> 47:41.807
I split up with Kim-Lin.

47:41.986 --> 47:43.977
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

47:44.155 --> 47:45.941
Let her go.

47:46.115 --> 47:48.356
- She was young, right?
- I'm really sorry.

47:48.534 --> 47:51.446
- It's all good.
- Anyway, I'd better... I'd better go.

47:51.620 --> 47:53.656
- Gonna come next week?
- Er...

47:54.290 --> 47:56.281
- I can?
- You'd better.

47:56.459 --> 47:58.791
Sure, I'll check my diary.

47:58.961 --> 48:01.543
- Bring Lloyd.
- Um...

48:01.714 --> 48:03.705
OK. I don't think it's really...

48:05.343 --> 48:06.924
..his cup of... I'll ask.

48:07.094 --> 48:08.959
If you ask him...

48:09.138 --> 48:11.129
he will come.

48:14.185 --> 48:16.050
- I'll see what I can do.
- Right,

48:16.228 --> 48:18.935
- Thank you again. You're very good.
- Ciao, Jill.

48:19.106 --> 48:21.062
- Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

48:22.401 --> 48:24.392
Bye-bye.

48:34.288 --> 48:36.279
I'm watching you.

48:39.877 --> 48:42.368
And by being in balance
with the colours around them,

48:42.546 --> 48:44.753
with a healthy colour
glow around themselves,

48:44.924 --> 48:46.789
they're living a fulfilled life.

48:46.967 --> 48:52.382
So when you're in a crisis, it doesn't
feel like the waves are crashing on you,

48:52.848 --> 48:56.466
it feels like you can just stand
under those waves

48:56.644 --> 48:58.509
and let them do their business,

48:58.687 --> 49:03.772
and then get a towel and bloody dry
yourself off, and go about your day.

49:03.943 --> 49:05.353
That's what it means.

49:06.153 --> 49:07.563
My mum is the exact type of person

49:07.738 --> 49:10.150
who is susceptible
to this mystic bullshit.

49:10.324 --> 49:12.064
I can picture her
telling Jackie at work

49:12.243 --> 49:13.403
how it's a bit over the top

49:13.577 --> 49:15.067
but there's something in it.

49:15.246 --> 49:17.111
If my dad radiated a colour,

49:17.289 --> 49:19.325
it'd be ochre or eggshell.

49:20.543 --> 49:23.501
He knows the number for the pothole
helpline off by heart.

49:23.671 --> 49:26.663
It's about a foot in diameter.
It's a bit of a concern.

49:27.508 --> 49:28.588
Pothole.

49:28.759 --> 49:31.546
Yes, that's right, Lloyd Tate.
Oh, hi, how are you?

49:31.720 --> 49:35.429
He was the first person in our village
to install double glazing.

49:38.602 --> 49:39.682
It's from Dad.

49:39.854 --> 49:41.719
He ruins every Christmas.

49:41.897 --> 49:43.888
It's a kettle.

49:45.109 --> 49:45.973
Great.

49:46.152 --> 49:48.564
..how extraordinary they are.

49:49.405 --> 49:51.396
Because they've forgotten, right?

49:52.450 --> 49:55.032
Maybe it's time for Dad
to rip off his vest again.

49:55.202 --> 49:58.444
I mean, it's a bit over the top,
but I think there's something in it.

49:58.622 --> 50:00.283
Yes, yes. Good turnout, was it?

50:00.458 --> 50:02.039
I'm going out for a bit.

50:02.793 --> 50:06.331
The question was, do I tell Jordana
about this Graham situation?

50:06.505 --> 50:08.370
I mean, we'd had sex.

50:08.549 --> 50:11.416
Wouldn't it spoil things
if I suddenly got emotional?

50:14.805 --> 50:17.672
I decided to soften the blow
with some light arson.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.596
You don't talk about your parents much.

50:24.773 --> 50:28.686
- I mean, do they get on?
- Yeah, they get on.

50:28.861 --> 50:30.394
Mine get on as well.

50:30.415 --> 50:33.030
It's good, isn't it?
It's important that they get on.

50:33.702 --> 50:36.264
So everything's fine at home,
everything's OK?

50:36.390 --> 50:37.820
Cos everything's fine with me.

50:39.038 --> 50:41.120
Actually, my mum's not well
at the moment.

50:41.290 --> 50:42.951
They get on, you know.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.706
That's the main thing.

50:45.669 --> 50:46.829
Yeah.

50:49.089 --> 50:51.205
Sorry, did you say your mum wasn't well?

50:51.383 --> 50:52.247
Yeah.

50:53.928 --> 50:55.919
Why, what's wrong?

50:56.764 --> 50:58.629
She's got...

50:58.807 --> 51:01.844
it's called...medulloblastoma.

51:06.607 --> 51:08.268
What does it mean?

51:09.360 --> 51:11.351
It means she's got a brain tumour.

51:15.115 --> 51:16.525
Oh, no.

51:20.704 --> 51:23.456
Confiding in Jordana was now impossible.

51:24.258 --> 51:25.739
Her mother had cancer.

51:25.909 --> 51:28.402
And in the Top Trumps
of parental problems,

51:28.526 --> 51:30.594
cancer beats potential infidelity.

51:31.924 --> 51:34.210
I would have to
travel this road secretly,

51:34.385 --> 51:36.046
unaided,

51:36.220 --> 51:37.960
a renegade,

51:38.138 --> 51:40.049
a solitary samurai.

52:14.091 --> 52:16.628
Things were a lot less fun since
Jordana's mother might die

52:16.802 --> 52:19.464
and my parents' marriage
started falling apart.

52:19.638 --> 52:22.254
I've been working on strategies
to solve both problems.

52:22.433 --> 52:25.971
I bought my dad some new aftershave,
but I'm drawing a blank on the cancer.

52:30.983 --> 52:34.191
You're fucked. Even if her mum
is terminal, it can still take ages.

52:34.361 --> 52:35.601
Please, Chip, shut up.

52:35.779 --> 52:37.519
This is not what you signed up for.

52:37.698 --> 52:40.531
This is about dipping your wick.
You've done that, game over.

52:40.701 --> 52:42.783
She'll be in no mood
to put out any more.

52:42.953 --> 52:44.363
No more Yuletide logging for you,

52:44.538 --> 52:47.780
unlike me, who shall be rolling in it
throughout the festive period.

52:47.958 --> 52:49.914
Do you actually pre-prepare these lines?

52:50.085 --> 52:51.950
I just split lines as they come to me.

52:52.129 --> 52:54.916
You've got to shut the shit down.
Keiron, get my back.

52:55.090 --> 52:56.921
- With extreme prejudice.
- Thank you.

52:57.092 --> 53:00.300
- Nothing's changed.
- Do what you want. Remember two things:

53:00.471 --> 53:02.302
one - treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

53:02.473 --> 53:04.338
Two - don't mix family and bush.

53:04.516 --> 53:07.804
Get the fuck out of here.
Merry Christmas. Have a good 'un.

53:09.021 --> 53:10.306
You all right?

53:10.481 --> 53:13.848
You've gotta shut this shit down.
It's fucking ridiculous.

I've been taking my duty as a boyfriend
seriously.

54:06.912 --> 54:09.699
Last night, I reread the book
I Only Want What's Best For You.

54:09.873 --> 54:11.363
I remembered a chapter that says:

54:20.459 --> 54:22.303
It's therefore in Jordana's interest

54:22.315 --> 54:24.421
that her dog dies before her mother does.

54:25.180 --> 54:27.045
Then we can get things back on track.

54:33.564 --> 54:35.395
Oliver Tate.

54:35.566 --> 54:37.557
OK, calm down.

54:38.736 --> 54:41.603
What happened?

54:42.990 --> 54:45.197
There was no need
to poison Jordana's dog

54:45.367 --> 54:47.858
because Jordana's dog
had just been hit by a train.

54:48.036 --> 54:50.903
I scraped his remains
into the bin liner I'd brought.

54:51.081 --> 54:54.573
The death of a pet makes it easier
to accept the death of a parent.

54:54.752 --> 54:58.415
I could feel the tension between Jordana
and I start to slip away.

55:12.436 --> 55:13.300
Oh!

55:13.479 --> 55:15.640
No, of course, I'm sorry. I just...

55:15.814 --> 55:17.805
I thought...

55:19.985 --> 55:21.976
We should bury him.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.941
No, I don't think we should.

55:25.115 --> 55:27.276
Foxes dig up dead animals and eat them.

55:28.619 --> 55:30.610
What should we do, then?

55:33.165 --> 55:35.907
Well, there's this thing the Vikings
used to do.

55:44.802 --> 55:46.667
Jude would like to meet you.

55:46.845 --> 55:48.551
- Who's Jude?
- My mum.

55:48.722 --> 55:50.462
Since when have you called her Jude?

55:50.641 --> 55:52.472
Since she might die in two weeks.

55:52.643 --> 55:53.928
Right.

55:54.978 --> 55:56.969
So, do you wanna come?

56:01.860 --> 56:05.273
The Bevans had Christmas dinner early
in case it was the last one they had.

56:05.447 --> 56:07.654
I hoped it wouldn't be,
cos the turkey was quite dry

56:07.825 --> 56:10.362
and the spouts had turned mushy
and out of focus.

56:10.536 --> 56:11.821
This is crackin', love.

56:11.995 --> 56:13.656
Yeah, it's great. Thank you, Mrs Bevan.

56:13.831 --> 56:16.288
This is my last warning. It's Jude.

56:16.458 --> 56:19.746
So, I hear from my little girl
that you've stolen her heart.

56:19.920 --> 56:20.625
Dad...

56:20.796 --> 56:23.538
Let me tell you,
if you're lucky enough to find an angel,

56:26.593 --> 56:29.005
hold onto her
with everything you've got.

56:30.597 --> 56:32.588
Oh, these fucking lights!

56:35.727 --> 56:37.718
Cheap shit.

56:41.400 --> 56:43.391
Oh, come on.

56:44.361 --> 56:48.070
You're acting like I'm dead already.

56:48.240 --> 56:49.525
Come on.

56:49.700 --> 56:51.941
It'd take more than
some silly tumour to kill me.

56:52.119 --> 56:54.781
- It might not.
- Oh, come on, now. Don't be daft.

56:57.416 --> 56:59.407
- Sorry.
- All right.

57:00.002 --> 57:01.993
Oh, it's all right, darling. Ssh.

57:03.589 --> 57:04.704
- Come here.
- Sorry, love.

57:04.882 --> 57:06.088
Are you all right? Come on.

57:06.258 --> 57:07.623
- Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.

57:07.801 --> 57:08.540
Sorry.

57:08.719 --> 57:09.754
- All right?
- Yeah.

57:09.928 --> 57:12.044
I'm fine. I'm fine. Give us a cudge.

57:12.890 --> 57:14.551
Listen... Thank you.

57:14.725 --> 57:16.340
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

57:16.518 --> 57:19.806
Thank you for looking after Jordana,
for walking through the fire with her.

57:19.980 --> 57:21.595
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- No.

57:21.773 --> 57:23.980
- No, we both do.
- He's a good boy, isn't he?

57:24.151 --> 57:25.641
Part of the family now. Deal?

57:25.819 --> 57:27.104
- Deal?
- Deal.

57:27.279 --> 57:28.564
Family, deal.

57:28.739 --> 57:29.899
Deal, yes?

57:30.073 --> 57:32.109
There we fucking go.

57:52.930 --> 57:55.797
Maybe you should come to the hospital
this Friday.

57:57.059 --> 58:00.017
Mum will have had her operation by then
and we can visit.

58:00.187 --> 58:03.600
- If you felt like it.
- Er, Friday.

58:04.358 --> 58:06.019
I've got to do some Christmas shopping.

58:06.193 --> 58:07.603
- What?
- I always leave it too late.

58:07.778 --> 58:10.064
- I want to get you something good.
- Mother might die.

58:10.238 --> 58:11.273
- I know.
- Do you care,

58:11.448 --> 58:13.439
- or couldn't you give a fuck?
- I do, clearly.

58:13.617 --> 58:15.073
I'll come. When is it?

58:15.243 --> 58:16.983
Friday.

58:18.664 --> 58:19.904
Great, yeah.

58:20.082 --> 58:23.870
Yeah, Friday's good for me, actually.
Yeah, I can do that. Excellent.

58:24.044 --> 58:26.251
Your skin's better.
You're allergic to the dog.

58:27.047 --> 58:28.537
I'm eating better.

58:28.715 --> 58:30.125
Following Mum's special diet.

58:30.300 --> 58:32.211
Is that because of the...

58:32.386 --> 58:34.251
We eat lots of ginger now.

58:34.429 --> 58:36.420
So, Friday.

58:37.099 --> 58:38.760
The visiting hours are six till eight.

58:38.934 --> 58:41.767
Got it. Six till eight.
I'll meet you there.

58:41.937 --> 58:43.068
OK.

58:43.939 --> 58:46.006
I'm sorry I'm like this.

58:46.566 --> 58:49.103
- I dunno. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

58:49.277 --> 58:50.926
Don't think you have to wait. It's cold.

58:50.927 --> 58:52.724
No, it's fine. I'll wait.

58:53.448 --> 58:55.063
I've got you these matches.

58:55.242 --> 58:57.233
Your favourite.

58:58.704 --> 59:00.285
I noticed the way you light a match.

59:00.455 --> 59:02.992
The flame is the same shape
as a falling tear.

59:04.001 --> 59:06.083
I knew then it was too late to save her.

59:06.837 --> 59:08.919
She'd gone gooey in the middle.

59:09.089 --> 59:12.126
From now on she'll buy little gifts
for her favourite teachers

59:12.300 --> 59:15.633
and she'll admire the scenery
and she'll buy soup for homeless people.

59:16.263 --> 59:18.675
And she'll never burn my leg here again.

59:22.060 --> 59:24.221
- Maybe I will go. It's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

59:24.396 --> 59:26.432
OK.

59:35.073 --> 59:37.064
Good night.

59:53.341 --> 59:56.708
When I discovered
I could see these colours in people,

59:56.887 --> 01:00:00.004
it took a long time because I was
in such a state of anxiety.

01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:04.642
It was when I started to be comfortable
with it and stopped trying to resist it,

01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:06.676
it started to nourish me.

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:09.267
And I could relax around it
and be in it.

01:00:09.441 --> 01:00:13.059
Then I started to make
more of an understanding of it.

01:00:18.366 --> 01:00:20.652
Well, it's um...

01:00:20.827 --> 01:00:22.818
It's interesting.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:27.155
He's really working that third eye,
isn't he?

01:00:28.085 --> 01:00:30.246
It's just a metaphor, Lloyd.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.536
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's good, yes.

01:00:33.799 --> 01:00:35.960
I like the whole colour coding thing.

01:00:36.134 --> 01:00:39.171
Well, I'd like to go again.

01:00:39.346 --> 01:00:41.337
I'd like you to be there, so...

01:00:43.183 --> 01:00:46.971
- You want us to go?
- Yes, I do.

01:00:47.729 --> 01:00:49.139
Right.

01:00:49.314 --> 01:00:50.895
Do I have to bring shorts?

01:00:51.066 --> 01:00:55.059
- It's on this Friday, so...
- Right, OK, yeah.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.231
What, are you coming or...

01:01:00.951 --> 01:01:03.988
Well, I'm intrigued, yeah.

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:06.323
- For sure.
- This Friday. This Friday.

01:01:06.498 --> 01:01:07.533
- This Friday?
- Mm-hm.

01:01:07.707 --> 01:01:09.572
OK, yep, yep.

01:01:10.752 --> 01:01:12.993
- Thank you.
- Mm.

01:01:13.755 --> 01:01:15.336
Don't let me down. OK?

01:01:15.507 --> 01:01:18.749
The most fantastical way people
experience the Graham T Purvis system

01:01:18.927 --> 01:01:20.167
is to come to the seminar.

01:01:20.345 --> 01:01:22.336
Oliver, what are you doing?

01:01:24.182 --> 01:01:26.389
..have been mind-blowing.
I've seen lives change.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.551
It's just incredible.

01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:35.103
I wish on a global scale
that people could get the message.

01:01:35.277 --> 01:01:38.110
Wouldn't it be just wonderful?

01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:42.109
Friday...

01:01:42.284 --> 01:01:44.320
I'll be OK. I'll be...

01:01:44.494 --> 01:01:47.236
I'll be fine, I'll be all right.

01:01:47.414 --> 01:01:49.279
Yeah, I'll be OK.

01:01:49.457 --> 01:01:51.288
Yeah.

01:02:27.329 --> 01:02:29.320
You should go in.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.345
Dad, aren't you going to Graham's thing?

01:03:37.524 --> 01:03:40.140
- Hm?
- Graham's thing. It's Friday.

01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:42.104
I thought you were going out.

01:03:42.279 --> 01:03:44.395
Yeah, I'm meant to be at the hospital.

01:03:44.572 --> 01:03:47.234
Well, you should get along then,
I suppose.

01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:49.616
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, I should go.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.741
Right, I'm off out.

01:03:59.254 --> 01:04:01.586
I'll see you, then.

01:04:03.091 --> 01:04:04.456
Bye.

01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:11.088
Dad, who would you save first
in a house fire,

01:04:11.266 --> 01:04:12.676
given the hypothetical situation

01:04:12.851 --> 01:04:15.092
that both Mum and I
were equally difficult to save?

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:16.430
I'd save your mother first,

01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:20.267
so we had a better chance
of working together to save you.

01:04:34.581 --> 01:04:36.788
Do you often feel like this?

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:38.118
Like what?

01:04:38.293 --> 01:04:41.376
- Tired?
- Down in the dumps.

01:04:43.256 --> 01:04:45.417
Quite often.

01:04:45.592 --> 01:04:47.583
How long for?

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:51.002
Since I was about your age, I suppose.

01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.172
What does it feel like?

01:04:55.894 --> 01:04:57.885
Like being underwater.

01:04:58.688 --> 01:05:01.475
Is that why you
became a marine biologist?

01:05:01.649 --> 01:05:03.480
Maybe, yeah.

01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:05.642
Have you always liked fish?

01:05:06.863 --> 01:05:08.854
I suppose so.

01:05:09.657 --> 01:05:13.070
I just sort of drifted into it, really.
No pun intended.

01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:15.235
And does Mum mind?

01:05:16.664 --> 01:05:18.404
I think she'd rather I earnt more money.

01:05:18.583 --> 01:05:20.448
No, you being underwater.

01:05:20.627 --> 01:05:21.537
Oh.

01:05:21.711 --> 01:05:23.247
Yeah, no.

01:05:23.421 --> 01:05:25.662
I'm sure she'd rather I wasn't.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.456
It's not very pleasant.

01:05:29.469 --> 01:05:31.505
The ocean is six miles deep, isn't it?

01:05:34.015 --> 01:05:36.006
Well remembered. Yeah.

01:05:40.814 --> 01:05:42.520
Could be Mum.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.555
Or Jordana.

01:06:25.586 --> 01:06:27.321
I haven't spoken to Jordana
about her mother

01:06:27.402 --> 01:06:29.555
because there's
only two possible outcomes.

01:06:29.529 --> 01:06:31.190
Either the operation was a success,

01:06:31.364 --> 01:06:34.276
in which case she'll be too relieved
to be angry with me for long,

01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:35.566
or her mother was dead,

01:06:35.743 --> 01:06:38.655
in which case she needs privacy
and time to grieve.

01:06:39.956 --> 01:06:42.823
During this brief hiatus,
I can help save my parents' marriage

01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:46.334
and then resume my duties
as the best boyfriend in the world.

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:13.687
Oliver.

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:15.028
Yes?

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.406
- What's this?
- I don't know.

01:07:16.576 --> 01:07:17.782
- What is this?
- A letter.

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:19.783
- I don't know what's in it.
- I think you do.

01:07:19.954 --> 01:07:21.945
Why did you write this, Oliver?

01:07:22.749 --> 01:07:24.159
This isn't funny.

01:07:24.334 --> 01:07:26.700
If I did write it, and I'm not as yet
admitting that I did,

01:07:26.878 --> 01:07:29.039
it'd be because I spoke to Dad.
This is what he wants.

01:07:29.214 --> 01:07:31.796
- You spoke to Dad?
- He knows he's been imperfect.

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:33.547
What did you talk about, Oliver?

01:07:33.718 --> 01:07:35.709
Listen,

01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:38.010
he still finds you attractive.

01:07:38.181 --> 01:07:40.172
He still wants to make love to you.

01:07:41.935 --> 01:07:43.095
Are you making this up?

01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:46.432
Me and Dad have discussed it.
We both want to make this marriage work.

01:07:46.606 --> 01:07:48.267
Are you with us?

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:37.537
Going to the beach with Graham.
I will not be back tonight.

01:09:09.647 --> 01:09:12.684
On New Year's Eve,
everyone from town goes to the beach.

01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:15.441
Chip said, if a girl won't get off
with you on New Year's Eve,

01:09:15.612 --> 01:09:17.022
you may as well cut it off.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.386
I'm starting to think that
we may grow apart.

01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:22.327
I don't want a mystic ninja
as a stepdad.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.283
I don't want to be
from a broken home like Chip's,

01:09:24.453 --> 01:09:25.916
wearing tracksuit tops instead of coats

01:09:26.013 --> 01:09:28.707
and taking gateway drugs
in shopping malls.

01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:30.740
I want my family back.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.908
I don't want anything to change.

01:10:28.476 --> 01:10:30.592
The celebrations are really kicking in,
right?

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:32.010
Yeah.

01:10:32.188 --> 01:10:34.179
It distresses tiny animals.

01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:36.890
- You can relax, right?
- Mm.

01:10:37.068 --> 01:10:39.525
- There's some lovely massage oils.
- Great. OK.

01:10:39.696 --> 01:10:41.027
In you get.

01:10:41.197 --> 01:10:43.188
All right.

01:11:31.748 --> 01:11:35.036
I have no idea what I'm hoping to
achieve by breaking into Graham's house.

01:11:35.209 --> 01:11:37.245
I just want to give him
the idea that I'm deranged

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:39.411
and therefore capable of anything.

01:11:39.589 --> 01:11:42.706
This will probably involve me urinating
or something.

01:11:49.348 --> 01:11:51.464
I need a fucking drink.

01:11:56.314 --> 01:11:58.020
I'm doing it. Just do it.

01:11:58.191 --> 01:11:59.806
Just do it...

01:11:59.984 --> 01:12:01.144
Just do it.

01:12:12.205 --> 01:12:13.240
OK.

01:12:13.414 --> 01:12:14.870
Feel my piss.

01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:17.497
Oh, come on.

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:19.659
Come on.

01:12:21.047 --> 01:12:23.208
Oh, for fuck...

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:25.373
Fuck.

01:12:25.968 --> 01:12:27.083
It's fine.

01:12:27.261 --> 01:12:29.252
Come on. Just...

01:12:33.559 --> 01:12:36.175
Fucking piss on your face,
you fucking freak.

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:41.389
For fuck's sake, just come on.
Loosen up.

01:12:48.908 --> 01:12:50.899
Oh, here we go.

01:12:53.913 --> 01:12:55.153
OK, that'll do it.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.501
Jesus Christ.

01:13:06.509 --> 01:13:08.045
Fuck.

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:33.024
Kim-Lin?

01:13:35.162 --> 01:13:37.153
Is that you?

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.323
Do you still have a key?

01:13:41.627 --> 01:13:43.618
That's very naughty.

01:13:48.509 --> 01:13:50.500
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

01:13:52.263 --> 01:13:54.345
What kind of protest's this, then, eh?

01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:57.222
Huh?

01:13:57.393 --> 01:14:00.885
How much more of this bizarre behaviour
do I have to endure?

01:14:12.992 --> 01:14:14.698
Nearly went red there.

01:14:14.869 --> 01:14:16.985
Come on, up you get, sweetheart.

01:14:17.163 --> 01:14:19.154
I'm just try...

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:25.333
My name is not Kim-Lin.

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:27.995
My name is Oliver Tate.

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:35.636
Hello.

01:14:37.183 --> 01:14:39.174
Hello.

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:42.385
Hello!

01:14:51.197 --> 01:14:53.188
Knock, knock.

01:14:54.825 --> 01:14:56.486
How are you feeling?

01:14:56.661 --> 01:14:58.526
I saw Mum with Graham at the beach.

01:14:58.704 --> 01:15:00.695
Mm. Mum told me everything.

01:15:01.332 --> 01:15:03.698
Did she say she went into the van
with his face on it?

01:15:03.876 --> 01:15:04.661
Yes.

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:07.201
Did she say what happened in the van
with his face on it?

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.369
Yes.

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:10.162
Aren't you angry?

01:15:10.341 --> 01:15:12.206
Worse things have happened at sea, Ol.

01:15:12.385 --> 01:15:14.876
- What did happen?
- That's between your mother and I.

01:15:15.054 --> 01:15:17.010
Lloyd, I think it best we be honest.

01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:18.466
Sweet pea,

01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:20.632
I gave Graham a handjob.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.432
Is there anything you'd like to say
about that?

01:15:26.232 --> 01:15:28.097
- Lloyd, do you want to add anything?
- No.

01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:32.644
OK. Well, I was drunk
and I was trying to relax Graham.

01:15:32.822 --> 01:15:35.404
- It was a silly thing to do.
- Mm.

01:15:35.908 --> 01:15:37.114
Thank you.

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:39.275
Your father and I have discussed it

01:15:40.162 --> 01:15:44.201
and if it's OK with everyone,
that's the last we'll say about it.

01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:46.240
OK? Thank you.

01:15:46.419 --> 01:15:50.207
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about now, huh?

01:15:52.258 --> 01:15:54.920
Me and Jordana
are having relationship problems.

01:15:55.094 --> 01:15:57.460
- Oh.
- It's difficult.

01:15:57.638 --> 01:16:00.004
I suppose it won't matter
when I'm 38 but...

01:16:00.182 --> 01:16:01.422
I'm upset about it.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.261
You should be more angry with her.

01:16:03.436 --> 01:16:05.427
Why would I be angry with Jordana?

01:16:06.439 --> 01:16:07.645
Oh, you mean me.

01:16:07.815 --> 01:16:09.351
Yes. No, no. Well, you know, I am.

01:16:09.525 --> 01:16:11.516
Yeah, I'm upset.

01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:15.728
We should go back to sleep, though.

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:17.362
Yeah.

01:16:17.533 --> 01:16:18.657
We're not going to punish you now

01:16:18.809 --> 01:16:21.305
but we're going to talk about
what you've done.

01:16:21.387 --> 01:16:22.717
What about what you've done?

01:16:22.805 --> 01:16:24.070
OK, don't push it, Ol.

01:16:24.248 --> 01:16:27.456
Well, we'll talk about that too
but you should go back to sleep now, OK?

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:30.038
- OK.
- Mm?

01:16:32.214 --> 01:16:34.205
Right.

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.581
Dear Oliver, I tried to tell you

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.712
but I figure
you'll only probably believe me

01:17:10.825 --> 01:17:12.827
if it's in writing. It's over.

01:17:13.005 --> 01:17:14.961
I enclose my lighter as a parting gift
for you.

01:17:15.132 --> 01:17:17.464
Also, I think you should know,
I've found someone else.

01:17:17.635 --> 01:17:19.842
When we're in school together,
try not to look upset.

01:17:20.012 --> 01:17:22.003
I know you're a good actor.

01:17:22.181 --> 01:17:26.299
PS: You were right about
my being allergic to dogs. I got tested.

01:17:26.477 --> 01:17:29.219
Oh, and in case you're interested,
my mum's fine now.

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:31.637
Sorry if it made you feel awkward.
