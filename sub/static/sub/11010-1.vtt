WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:28.068
Come on, the bus won't wait.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.198
Hurry, come on...

01:08.485 --> 01:13.697
Wait! Wait for me!

01:17.410 --> 01:19.536
Stop!

01:27.045 --> 01:29.046
Listen!

03:35.048 --> 03:38.550
Hello? Is anyone home?

04:15.922 --> 04:18.257
Is anyone home?

04:28.142 --> 04:31.395
I'm a foreigner,
and I'm lost!

04:46.119 --> 04:49.079
I know someone is there,
please!

07:21.315 --> 07:24.484
Well, this is quite a revelation
to me, Professor.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.320
I had no idea
an expert on insects

07:27.405 --> 07:29.906
could provide the police
with such invaluable help

07:29.991 --> 07:31.908
in a homicide investigation.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.328
Normally we don't,
but I made the unfortunate error

07:35.413 --> 07:39.124
of becoming an expert
on cadaverous fauna.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.462
John, we're not going through
that whole number again, are we?

07:43.546 --> 07:48.467
Yes, just like the first time
you came here all those years ago.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.970
Do you remember
the first case we solved together?

07:52.054 --> 07:55.348
When a dead body
is exposed to the elements,

07:55.433 --> 07:58.018
sooner or later
it is eaten up by insects.

07:58.644 --> 08:02.189
Hey! You naughty girl!

08:03.107 --> 08:06.067
Hey! Where did you get this?

08:07.403 --> 08:08.862
You know you could cut yourself?

08:08.946 --> 08:13.533
Look. Look here...
you could cut yourself with this.

08:13.618 --> 08:18.580
See! It's not a toy!
Not a toy.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.290
Where did you find it?

08:22.126 --> 08:28.340
Outside!
And who, may I ask put it out there?

08:30.176 --> 08:34.929
I don't want you ever, ever
playing with this again!

08:40.061 --> 08:42.395
Oh, I forgot to introduce you,
this is Inga!

08:43.397 --> 08:45.690
She's my nurse.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.901
If I pick out something
with my laser,

08:47.985 --> 08:50.070
she never forgets it!

08:52.240 --> 08:57.452
She's also my friend too
aren't you, Inga?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.748
But, she's a very good nurse!

09:02.291 --> 09:06.378
Insects that eat cadavers
are divided into eight groups.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.548
Eight groups of insects
that follow one another

09:09.632 --> 09:12.425
installing themselves
at exact moments,

09:12.510 --> 09:15.220
and on precise terms.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.389
Never sooner and never later.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.601
We call them
the eight squadrons of death!

09:21.686 --> 09:24.396
First comes the common fly -

09:24.480 --> 09:27.315
lays its eggs
on the rotting corpse.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.277
And thus the cycle begins.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.447
Each group stays 15 days.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.158
15, multiplied by 8.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.205
- The number of the groups is...
- Four months.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.374
In the case of this head,

09:44.458 --> 09:49.337
the cycle not only seems to be
complete, but to have been repeated.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.299
- Which puts us at...
- Eight months!

09:52.383 --> 09:54.175
Now I see.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.887
By calculating the presence and growth
of the flies or the maggots,

09:57.972 --> 10:01.391
you can pinpoint
the exact date of death.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.894
- Or murder.
- Our victim was decapitated

10:04.979 --> 10:09.107
- some eight months ago.
- And 1 5 days.

10:09.191 --> 10:12.736
1 5 days while the body
was submerged in the lake,

10:14.113 --> 10:17.741
before the putrefying gasses
brought it to the surface,

10:17.825 --> 10:21.953
and thence to the shore,
where the first flies arrived.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.205
Eight and a half months then.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.457
Perhaps a little less,

10:25.541 --> 10:29.711
The mountain wind, the föhn,
was unusually warm this year.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.423
- So we could say...
- That she lost her head

10:33.507 --> 10:37.802
somewhere between,
September 7th and 10th.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.348
Am I right, John?
Let's see now, about that time.

10:41.432 --> 10:46.269
The first girl to disappear...
that was 9th September.

10:46.354 --> 10:50.607
A 14 year old Danish tourist.
Vera Brandt.

10:50.691 --> 10:54.861
The body was never found.
Just like the other girl's.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.991
Like Greta.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.702
Poor Greta.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.750
She's on that list too.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.586
She's missing,
but we have no proof she's dead.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.465
After finding this, what's the use
of hiding from the facts?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.385
There's a killer!

11:19.387 --> 11:22.055
A vicious killer!

11:24.892 --> 11:26.768
A girl killer.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.937
We'll get him!

11:30.981 --> 11:33.149
And when we do...

11:34.276 --> 11:35.985
Goodnight, Professor!

12:04.765 --> 12:06.683
Do you know this part
of the country?

12:06.767 --> 12:09.394
No, this is my first trip to Europe.

12:09.478 --> 12:13.606
It's a very unusual area.
People call it the Swiss Transylvania.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.152
- Why?
- I don't know. They just do.

12:17.236 --> 12:21.740
So, you are the Corvino girl.
Your father is terribly...

12:21.824 --> 12:23.533
Yes, isn't he!

12:23.617 --> 12:25.535
I admire him very much.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.037
I thought he might have
come with you.

12:28.122 --> 12:32.751
Dad's working in the Philippines.
He'll be there for almost a year.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.837
He can't even be reached
by telephone.

12:36.422 --> 12:40.759
Well, in any case,
he's placed you in good hands.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.678
I'm sure
you're going to like our school.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.556
To begin with,
we all speak English.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.809
And then our academic programme
is based on the American one.

12:49.894 --> 12:54.731
Ah! A bee!
Be careful it might sting you!

12:54.815 --> 12:58.276
No, leave it alone!

13:00.404 --> 13:04.657
Look out!
No, don't kill it, please!

13:04.742 --> 13:07.827
- Don't touch it!
- Stop yelling!

13:07.912 --> 13:10.413
- It's a bee!
- I know!

13:10.498 --> 13:15.752
It won't hurt me.
Insects never hurt me. I love them.

13:16.462 --> 13:21.883
- You, you love them?
- Yes. I love all insects.

13:35.981 --> 13:40.318
And so Jennifer arrives
in Switzerland from the New World

13:40.402 --> 13:43.029
to pass her first memorable night

13:43.113 --> 13:47.200
at the Richard Wagner
International School for girls.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.545
Take the bags in, please.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.303
Impressive, isn't it?

14:07.388 --> 14:10.306
The estate was once
Richard Wagner's home.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.517
The school only occupies
the main building.

14:12.601 --> 14:17.146
The others are closed because
they're not safe. Never go into them.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.107
Come along.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.344
- I'm starved. Is there anything to eat?
- No, sorry.

14:48.429 --> 14:53.433
I haven't eaten anything
but breakfast for two days.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.895
- What are they?
- Baby food.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.899
My parents left it when they came
to visit me with my little brother.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.484
Chicken, beef...

15:05.112 --> 15:09.115
- ...mixed vegetables.
- He's seven months old.

15:09.199 --> 15:13.328
I bet he's the only male who's ever
seen me inside of this place.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.915
Mixed vegetables, great!
I'm a vegetarian.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.667
- I need a...
- Spoon? No.

15:38.979 --> 15:43.024
- How is it?
- Like cat food.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.818
By the way, I'm Sophie,
I'm French.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.570
- Jennifer.
- Hi!

15:47.655 --> 15:50.156
Have you met
the headmistress yet?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.784
Speaking of the devil.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.956
You are the new girl.
You were expected this afternoon.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.250
My plane was late
because of bad weather.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.920
Would you like some?

16:06.840 --> 16:11.177
The school has its rules.
I'm sorry, but I must confiscate this.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.429
Hey, wait. You don't know who that is.
That's Paul Corvino!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.515
Sophie, get into bed!

16:15.599 --> 16:18.267
If I catch you smoking again,
you'll be sorry.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.020
And you, young lady,
to bed!

16:23.941 --> 16:26.109
And switch off the light.

16:29.863 --> 16:33.199
That bitch, stealing Paul Corvino!

16:33.283 --> 16:36.786
Yeah, it's all right,
I have a bunch of them in my bag.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.373
So tomorrow, I'll put them all up
all over the room.

16:40.457 --> 16:44.794
I've seen all his movies.
I saw his last one three times!

16:44.878 --> 16:49.215
Lucky you! He must have made me
sit through it at least 15 times.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.467
He says he trusts my opinion.

16:51.552 --> 16:56.264
- You mean, you know him?
- Yes, of course I do!

16:56.348 --> 16:59.308
Have you been to bed with him?

16:59.393 --> 17:02.061
Paul Corvino is my father.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.814
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

17:04.897 --> 17:07.650
Your mother lives in lndia
and owns a hotel!

17:07.734 --> 17:10.361
- She remarried.
- Your father never did.

17:10.445 --> 17:13.281
You were only seven
when they split up.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.742
- No, I was eight!
- Eight... you were seven!

17:16.827 --> 17:19.412
How do you know so much
about Paul Corvino?

17:19.496 --> 17:20.997
I read "Cine Review"!

17:22.833 --> 17:25.710
Well, it was Christmas Day...

17:27.755 --> 17:31.382
We were opening presents together.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.929
And the phone rang.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.727
So... Mum answered it.

17:49.068 --> 17:53.321
She said,
"I'll be right there!"

18:00.662 --> 18:02.705
And it was her lover.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.210
So then she left...

18:09.463 --> 18:12.840
...and she never came back.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.804
I remember Dad
got 12 presents that year.

18:18.806 --> 18:22.767
And he said the 13th,
was Mum walking out on him like that.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.149
You didn't read that
in "Cine Review", did you?

18:30.234 --> 18:34.445
I'm really glad you're here.
I've always had to sleep alone.

18:34.530 --> 18:37.240
It can be very scary.
Thanks for coming.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.451
I'm the one who should thank you.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.329
Don't let me forget,
I owe you a meal.

18:43.413 --> 18:47.125
You know, there's a murderer
around here. A crazy man.

18:47.209 --> 18:51.045
A maniac who kidnaps girls our age
and kills them.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.422
And then, he hides the bodies.

18:54.216 --> 18:59.679
Can we change the subject?
I'm really tired from the trip!

18:59.763 --> 19:04.058
You're right, sometimes I lie awake
all night, thinking about it.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.520
What do you think about
before you fall asleep?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.108
My father.

19:12.943 --> 19:17.530
On the other hand, if I think about
your father, I won't sleep at all.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.786
You mind if I watch TV?
I've got earphones.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.123
No problem.
Goodnight, Sophie!

19:27.207 --> 19:29.417
Goodnight, Jennifer!

25:22.604 --> 25:27.024
- That's shitty.
- Are you okay?

25:27.108 --> 25:29.193
Are you hurt?

25:40.121 --> 25:45.709
Why are you dressed like that?
Do you understand me?

25:56.137 --> 26:00.391
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I'm sleepwalking...

26:00.475 --> 26:03.852
- Can you understand me?
- Wake me up!

26:03.937 --> 26:06.939
- I asked if you understand me.
- Let me go!

26:07.023 --> 26:12.236
- Do you think she would do it?
- She's an addict. Just look at her eyes!

26:12.946 --> 26:15.781
Let me out!

26:15.865 --> 26:20.369
Maybe she's on drugs.
Open your eyes.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.958
Cut it out!
Sit still, you little shit!

26:35.468 --> 26:38.512
Is she lying?

26:38.597 --> 26:41.223
Come on, let's go.

28:15.568 --> 28:18.779
Is this the first time
you've been sleepwalking?

28:18.863 --> 28:22.157
No, it's happened before
in the States.

28:23.326 --> 28:28.205
You look a mess, child.
Have you any idea where you've been?

28:32.752 --> 28:38.757
No. It's all a blank.
I never remember anything.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.432
- My saviour.
- So you're American?

28:46.516 --> 28:50.853
I'm studying at the academy.
Where are you from?

28:50.937 --> 28:54.773
I'm from Scotland. I came here
as a student and stayed to teach.

28:55.775 --> 28:59.903
Then I had this accident
and I haven't moved since.

28:59.988 --> 29:05.659
- What do you teach?
- Entomology. I study insects.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.453
Really?

29:07.537 --> 29:12.124
- Do insects interest you?
- Yes, a lot! I love them!

29:12.208 --> 29:16.003
Do you mean that?
Absolutely. Why?

29:16.087 --> 29:18.922
You remind me of another girl.

29:19.007 --> 29:22.468
Greta. She used to come here
sometimes and help out.

29:22.552 --> 29:27.848
- Mostly secretarial work, and then...
- Then?

29:27.932 --> 29:31.351
She was supposed to come here
one night. She never arrived.

29:31.436 --> 29:35.105
- The killer got her.
- What do you know about that?

29:37.400 --> 29:41.820
Well, you used the past tense,
as if she were dead.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.908
She left her coat here.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.952
You must be frozen, child!

29:49.037 --> 29:51.622
It should fit you.
It's upstairs.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.832
Here, she'll show you where it is.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.993
No, wait a second.
Where are you going?

30:32.789 --> 30:34.873
Nice, I like it.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.839
There's a good boy.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.550
Now, don't play any tricks.

30:46.761 --> 30:48.595
Bullseye!

30:50.890 --> 30:55.102
What beats me
is that it never misses.

30:56.771 --> 31:00.691
The species is
supposed to be practically blind.

31:05.947 --> 31:10.534
- Thanks! Be careful you're in range.
- It won't do anything to me.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.665
You look like Greta in that coat.

31:18.084 --> 31:20.168
She liked insects too.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.172
But they didn't like her
the way that one likes you!

31:25.174 --> 31:29.720
That sound that you can hear
is a mating call.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.765
You're exciting it.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.728
Smell it...

31:38.646 --> 31:41.189
Go on, smell it!

31:45.570 --> 31:47.571
It's sort of sweet.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.657
That substance
is secreted by a gland.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.411
It too is meant to attract a mate.

31:56.122 --> 32:00.083
You're exciting him,
and he's doing his best to excite you!

32:01.336 --> 32:03.503
And to think we only just met!

32:04.672 --> 32:08.926
This isn't the mating season.
I can't understand it.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.681
I've never seen anything
like it before.

32:17.268 --> 32:20.103
Well, thanks for everything.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.445
Stop by anytime!

32:30.114 --> 32:31.823
Goodnight!

32:33.117 --> 32:35.869
You make an old man happy,
take the cable car.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.622
It's only a five minute ride
from the town!

32:39.624 --> 32:42.334
I don't know. Maybe.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.587
And mind how you go
with that sleepwalking!

32:45.672 --> 32:47.589
If it happens again say,

32:47.674 --> 32:55.013
"I am sleepwalking! I must wake up!
I am sleepwalking! I must wake up!"

32:57.141 --> 33:02.479
I am sleepwalking! I must wake up!
I am sleepwalking...

33:05.566 --> 33:09.403
I won't need it!
I haven't had an attack for ages.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.323
It must have been the trip out.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.618
Or maybe the change of air.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.333
Maybe the wind.

33:23.418 --> 33:29.339
The wind? Yes.
The föhn. A very particular wind.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.884
Typical of this part
of the country.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.095
It comes from the Alps.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.433
The blasts of warm air
cause snow avalanches.

33:40.810 --> 33:45.147
Make the flowers grow.
The hatching of the larvae.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.692
Some people get headaches.

33:50.319 --> 33:54.406
When it blows, there are those
who say it causes madness.

33:55.742 --> 34:02.330
It's a strange part of the country.
The Swiss Transylvania.

34:09.672 --> 34:12.799
Will someone tell me
what this E.E.G. is supposed to do?

34:12.884 --> 34:15.719
What you did last night
is highly irregular.

34:15.803 --> 34:19.848
No student ever left the school
at night before.

34:19.931 --> 34:21.975
How many times
do I have to tell you

34:22.060 --> 34:27.022
that I didn't walk out on purpose.
I walk in my sleep!

34:28.565 --> 34:30.108
It happens.

34:30.193 --> 34:33.862
But it is not normal.
It's our duty to know more.

34:33.946 --> 34:37.324
But I know everything there is
to know about it.

34:37.408 --> 34:41.995
I've been examined by the best.
It's not an illness.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.290
This could lead
to something far more serious!

34:45.373 --> 34:47.458
You say you remember nothing.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.170
This is not a matter
of talking in your sleep

34:50.254 --> 34:52.130
or ransacking the fridge!

34:52.215 --> 34:55.717
It could be leading up to
a new personality trying to emerge.

34:55.802 --> 35:00.931
Sometimes, it's the first step
on the path to schizophrenia.

35:02.391 --> 35:06.728
So you think I'm crazy?
Well, you can forget your E.E.G!

35:08.564 --> 35:11.775
There now, calm down,
calm down.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.778
OK, OK, go ahead!

35:14.862 --> 35:17.781
I'll show you
which one of us is crazy!

35:34.423 --> 35:37.300
- What happened?
- That's strange.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.232
Do you suffer from epilepsy?

35:52.316 --> 35:57.362
Or do you take something like...
do you understand, drugs?

36:00.032 --> 36:06.705
I am not crazy, schizophrenic,
epileptic or stoned.

36:18.009 --> 36:23.722
Sophie, I need to speak to you.
There's something I have to tell you.

36:30.146 --> 36:34.941
Hello, Shapiro Evans?
Hi, I'd like to speak to Morris please?

36:35.902 --> 36:39.738
I mean Mr Shapiro.
Jennifer Corvino.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.617
Right, Paul Corvino's daughter.

36:45.411 --> 36:47.454
He's out of town?

36:49.165 --> 36:51.082
Three days?

36:52.418 --> 36:56.046
What do you mean, it's a holiday?
What holiday is it?

36:56.130 --> 36:58.715
Passover?

37:04.222 --> 37:07.849
Hey, have you heard?
She walks in her sleep!

37:07.934 --> 37:10.810
If you ask me, she's got problems!

37:10.895 --> 37:13.188
So that's Paul Corvino's daughter.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.399
That still doesn't give her the right
to be a show-off!

37:18.069 --> 37:20.445
Here she comes!

37:24.533 --> 37:26.409
- What's wrong?
- Damn Morris.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.912
Who's he? Your boyfriend?

37:28.996 --> 37:31.456
He's my father's agent and attorney.

37:31.540 --> 37:34.084
I want to tell him
to get me out of this shitty school.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.461
- He found it.
- Why do you want to leave?

37:36.545 --> 37:39.839
Your little brother is not the only male
to have graced this place.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.592
- First, you forgot the doctor.
- He's not a man.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.845
He's got more hands
than the entire basketball team!

37:45.930 --> 37:49.307
- And second, you forgot the killer!
- Killer!

37:55.273 --> 37:59.484
What is the poet trying to say
with these words?

37:59.568 --> 38:04.072
Well? Who's going to answer?
You tell us!

38:04.156 --> 38:06.825
- Me?
- Yes, you Elizabeth!

38:08.577 --> 38:14.582
I think, the poet took the words
right out of a Bee Gees song.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.752
That's very funny.

38:17.837 --> 38:20.171
The poet in question
is Abraham Cowley.

38:20.256 --> 38:25.802
What if the killer saw me?
I'm really scared.

38:25.886 --> 38:28.179
I would be too.

38:29.473 --> 38:33.768
lmagine if I walk in my sleep again
tonight. I'm going to run into him.

38:36.647 --> 38:39.524
Please, promise you'll keep
an eye on me tonight.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.484
I'll lock the door.

38:41.569 --> 38:45.238
And if you hear me get up
or do anything, wake me.

38:46.032 --> 38:50.285
Promise?
Please, say yes.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.620
- Sophie? You tell us.
- Me?

38:52.747 --> 38:55.498
Yes. Stand up!

38:58.836 --> 39:01.296
The poet,
through his irregular style...

39:01.380 --> 39:03.631
The poet,
through his irrigular style...

39:03.716 --> 39:06.217
- Regular!
- ...irregular style...

39:06.302 --> 39:08.386
...tells us of the dangers we face,

39:08.471 --> 39:10.680
should we forget
the meaning of the past.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.640
...tells us of the danger we face,

39:12.725 --> 39:15.143
should we forget
the meaning of the past.

39:15.227 --> 39:17.771
And do you believe
that danger exists?

39:17.855 --> 39:20.440
- Screw the past.
- Screw the past!

39:28.240 --> 39:33.036
Silence! What about Ancient Greece?
Shakespeare? Chopin?

39:33.120 --> 39:35.288
OK, I'll keep an eye on you tonight.

39:35.373 --> 39:38.333
- And Richard Wagner!
- Richard Gere!

41:52.426 --> 41:55.303
- Do you like it?
- Nice! Where did it come from?

41:55.387 --> 41:58.973
I put it on by mistake.
Guess who it belongs to!

41:59.058 --> 42:01.476
Paul Corvino's daughter!

42:01.560 --> 42:03.853
- Yeah? The actor?
- Yes!

42:03.938 --> 42:07.315
Her name is Jennifer
and she's my roommate!

42:07.399 --> 42:08.858
All right!

42:08.943 --> 42:13.446
Oh, yes! He's fantastic,
all those muscles!

42:13.531 --> 42:15.657
Not him, her!
What is she like?

42:15.741 --> 42:19.994
Oh, she's pretty,
she wears her hair like mine.

42:20.079 --> 42:23.540
I have to watch her at night
because she walks in her sleep.

42:23.624 --> 42:28.628
- Walks in her sleep?
- She gets up and she walks, like this...

42:44.395 --> 42:48.940
Really, Sophie, I have to go.
I have to join my regiment at dawn!

42:49.024 --> 42:51.693
And you know it's nearly
a three hour trip.

42:51.777 --> 42:56.614
- Come on, stay a while longer!
- I can't, I really have to go.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.241
You shit!

42:58.325 --> 43:00.994
- What did you say?
- I said, fuck you!

44:31.251 --> 44:37.048
I'm sleepwalking,
I must... must...

44:39.551 --> 44:42.011
I must wake up.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.709
Sophie!

49:04.524 --> 49:06.609
The police came this morning.

49:06.693 --> 49:10.071
The headmistress
told them not to believe me.

49:10.155 --> 49:12.031
She thinks I'm crazy.

49:12.115 --> 49:14.200
Maybe you think I'm crazy too, Dad,

49:14.284 --> 49:16.744
if Production gets this letter to you.

49:16.828 --> 49:18.913
There was nothing I could do.

49:18.997 --> 49:20.873
I was so scared,

49:20.958 --> 49:24.710
I couldn’t say anything
about what I saw or why I screamed.

49:54.324 --> 49:57.660
So you think the glove
belonged to the killer?

49:57.744 --> 50:00.454
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

50:00.539 --> 50:02.581
But why the maggot?

50:03.917 --> 50:06.168
They're larvae.

50:07.921 --> 50:10.589
If you give me time
I'll identify them...

50:12.134 --> 50:15.011
...and will be able
to give you an answer.

50:15.804 --> 50:18.723
Perhaps to some other questions
as well.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.767
You won't, Professor.

50:21.852 --> 50:24.186
It's all right. I know the way.

50:25.188 --> 50:27.606
Jennifer!

50:28.692 --> 50:32.862
- You're forgetting your notebooks!
- Thanks.

50:32.946 --> 50:36.323
Have you any idea
why they behave like that?

50:36.408 --> 50:38.576
Never done this before.

50:39.619 --> 50:42.538
It's probably because of me.

50:42.622 --> 50:44.999
I guess they sense
the mood I'm in.

50:45.083 --> 50:48.252
I'm often in a bad mood.

50:48.336 --> 50:51.630
Upset about something,
but they don't carry on like this.

50:54.468 --> 50:58.971
In Ancient Greece,
the butterfly symbolises the soul,

50:59.056 --> 51:01.390
the so-called psyche.

51:02.559 --> 51:05.644
From the Greek, butterfly: psyche.

51:06.480 --> 51:11.275
What is this association
between insects and the human soul?

51:13.570 --> 51:18.032
Is it because of
the multifarious mystery of them both?

51:19.326 --> 51:24.371
And we know something about that,
don't we?

51:26.416 --> 51:28.584
OK.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.173
You see that glove?

51:35.592 --> 51:40.179
An insect... a firefly
led me to it.

51:44.976 --> 51:47.186
The police came to the school.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.565
They asked me a lot of questions.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.318
I didn't tell them
how I found the glove.

51:56.488 --> 51:59.281
I didn't want them
to think I was crazy.

52:01.701 --> 52:05.496
You can tell me.
I'm not the police!

52:05.580 --> 52:07.998
What happened?

52:12.796 --> 52:15.131
I was standing alone...

52:16.925 --> 52:18.968
...in the dark.

52:19.052 --> 52:23.180
And... I needed help.

52:26.226 --> 52:30.354
And a firefly,
it was like it heard me

52:30.438 --> 52:32.940
and it answered my call!

52:41.116 --> 52:45.327
You've calmed them down,
just by telling me that.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.830
But that's ridiculous!

52:47.914 --> 52:49.874
It's new.

52:49.958 --> 52:53.669
That's the essence of discovery
to a scientist.

52:53.753 --> 52:57.214
Purely new,
the things I've discovered.

52:57.299 --> 53:01.093
Things my fellow scientists
consider absurd.

53:01.178 --> 53:04.054
Extrasensory perception.

53:04.139 --> 53:09.852
The paranormal powers...
that are unusual in human beings

53:09.936 --> 53:12.062
are perfectly normal in insects!

53:12.147 --> 53:14.648
Some species
communicate with each other

53:14.733 --> 53:18.777
over vast distances by telepathy.

53:18.904 --> 53:21.614
These little creatures
have enormous power.

53:21.698 --> 53:24.783
I could give you
a multitude of examples.

53:25.493 --> 53:29.038
I wrote a book about this very subject.
You may have it.

53:29.122 --> 53:33.918
It's perfectly normal for insects
to be slightly telepathic.

53:34.002 --> 53:36.337
Yes, it's normal for insects.

53:41.509 --> 53:44.178
But am I normal?

53:58.068 --> 53:59.526
Jennifer!

54:14.501 --> 54:16.335
But why me?

54:16.419 --> 54:20.756
Fräulein Corvino cannot be left alone.
I want someone in here with her.

54:21.383 --> 54:24.009
I want to know everything
she says and does.

54:24.094 --> 54:27.846
I'm scared of her.
She arrived and Sophie disappeared!

54:27.973 --> 54:31.308
Plus she's crazy,
listen to this.

54:33.311 --> 54:35.479
"Dear Dad..."

54:36.856 --> 54:38.524
Here it is.

54:38.608 --> 54:40.693
"Do you remember
what the doctor said

54:40.777 --> 54:43.862
"about sleepwalking manifesting
a split personality?

54:43.989 --> 54:47.324
"It's true,
my second personality is emerging.

54:47.409 --> 54:50.869
"Do you know how?
I communicate with insects!"

54:53.832 --> 54:58.377
"I mean, I've discovered
I have power over them.

54:58.461 --> 55:02.131
"I'm not kidding,
I even have a witness,

55:02.215 --> 55:04.717
"the famous entomologist,
John McGregor,

55:04.801 --> 55:07.428
"who lives near here.
We've become friends..."

55:07.512 --> 55:10.514
You see? She is crazy!

55:10.598 --> 55:12.808
This is mine!

55:22.235 --> 55:24.820
- Hey, Jennifer, listen!
- What?

55:25.655 --> 55:30.284
I'm a spider!
Speak and you shall be obeyed!

55:30.368 --> 55:33.704
No, no! Stop it!

55:33.788 --> 55:37.041
I'm a killer spray!
Death to all insects!

55:37.125 --> 55:40.586
- I'm a mosquito!
- I'm a fly!

55:56.686 --> 56:01.398
We worship you,
we worship you!

56:01.483 --> 56:03.650
Now that's enough, girls!

56:32.931 --> 56:34.598
I love you.

56:36.851 --> 56:39.686
I love you all.

56:42.982 --> 56:45.401
I love all of you.

57:56.639 --> 57:59.141
- She's still asleep.
- I called an ambulance

57:59.225 --> 58:02.603
to take her to the mental hospital.
They'll be here any minute.

58:02.687 --> 58:05.063
They'll be better equipped
to keep her calm.

58:05.190 --> 58:10.068
- But, is she insane?
- Well, she's not normal.

58:10.153 --> 58:13.739
- She's diabolic!
- Diabolic?

58:13.823 --> 58:19.453
The Bible also refers
to the Devil as Beelzebub,

58:19.537 --> 58:26.210
which means Lord of the flies.
Look at her, the Lady of the flies.

58:27.837 --> 58:30.631
Call me as soon as she wakes up.

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:14.461
Diabolic?

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:20.967
Hey, does Jennifer look
like a devil to you?

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.015
No... you're not a devil.

01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.560
The only devil around here
is the killer!

01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:33.855
But I understand
how you must be feeling.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:38.443
I know what it feels like
to be different.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:44.908
And the conditions that go with it,
pity, irony, revulsion... annoyance.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.914
People have the ability
to make you almost hate yourself.

01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:53.709
There's a big difference
between you and me.

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.628
When that car bashed into me,
I lost something.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:02:00.382
But you, you gained something.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:04.511
You're in a position
to do extraordinary things

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:06.596
with that gift of yours.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:10.058
Come on!
I want to show you something.

01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:14.146
Come on, Inga.

01:02:18.317 --> 01:02:22.946
Look, these were inside the glove.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.325
Larvae of the Great Sarcophagus.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:32.205
Quite a menacing name,
appropriate to the insect that bears it.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:42.632
It lives exclusively off dead bodies.
Human remains.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:46.678
The Great Sarcophagus.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:50.474
What a weird name!

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:54.352
They're a destroyer,
a flesh eater.

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.647
It is capable of picking up

01:02:57.732 --> 01:03:01.651
the scent of a dead body
over vast distances.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:07.741
Its sensory perception is extraordinary,
quite unique.

01:03:08.659 --> 01:03:11.286
But why did the glove
have so many larvae in it?

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:15.081
Perhaps because when the murderer
hides his victims

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:21.254
he likes to keep in physical contact
with them. Conserving them.

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:26.468
He is a psychopath.
If we mean to get him,

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:32.808
we have to call on the services of
the two greatest detectives ever known.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:38.980
Perhaps I should say unknown,
up until now.

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:46.112
- Who are they?
- You... and him.

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.829
The Great Sarcophagus.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.752
Hold out your hand.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:12.347
There. See, he's not afraid of you.
He won't do that for me.

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:15.809
Ask him to lead you
where the dead bodies are hidden,

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:18.186
and he'll lead you.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:21.189
That fly is your magic wand.

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:24.693
Think it'll work?

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:26.903
With your gift.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:31.616
It'll take a lifetime!
It could be anywhere.

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:37.122
Not anywhere.
On a 52 km route.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:43.003
The first girl to disappear
was a Danish tourist.

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:45.839
She took a bus on the Red Line.

01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:49.217
It starts on the city square
on a 52 km route,

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.928
calling at various tourist traps
on the way.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:56.057
She was seen getting on that bus.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:05:01.062
When you get near the killer's house,
you'll know about it soon enough

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:04.816
because the Sarcophagus
will go crazy

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.319
and head straight for the dead bodies.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:11.406
All you have to do is follow it
and come straight back.

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:15.493
Do you feel up to it?

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.998
Yes. I want him caught.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.086
For Sophie.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:30.175
She was my friend!

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:34.262
And I want him caught, for Greta.

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:39.768
I wish you all the luck in the world,
my two detectives.

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:16.322
Excuse me, Miss.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:19.743
- I don't understand German.
- Please close the window.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.620
- The wind!
- No!

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.749
So badly behaved!

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:12.754
Wait! Wait! Please!

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.299
Thanks.

01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.305
What are you doing here?

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.141
- I was following a...
- Who are you?

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:21.479
- You came here to steal, did you?
- No! I was looking for someone!

01:13:21.563 --> 01:13:24.774
You were looking for someone!
Come on, the house is empty!

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:29.404
No one's lived here since the former
tenants moved out eight months ago.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.364
The house is for sale!

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:35.326
I'm really sorry!
I didn't mean to cause any harm!

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:43.769
- May I help you?
- Who are you?

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:45.938
I'm the estate agent.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:49.400
If you're looking for a house
I'm your man!

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.569
Anyone living in the house now?

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:54.864
No. By the way,
where did you come from?

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:58.284
- I didn't hear you drive up.
- I came from the back.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.579
How long has the house been empty?

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:04.665
Seven, eight months maybe.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:08.336
- Who lived here before?
- I'd have to check at the agency.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.422
But we do not give out
that kind of information.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.634
It's absolutely confidential,
and against our company.

01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:17.929
I'm Inspector Geiger. Police.

01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:15.921
It's all right, Inga. You've locked
yourself out, you silly girl!

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:25.640
This damn machine!
What on Earth is going on round here?

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:31.896
Who's that?
Is there someone there?

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:42.031
Who is it?
Hey! Answer me!

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.034
Who are you?

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:26.719
Most of our patients
are kept under restraint.

01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:28.679
Take my word for it, Inspector.

01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.599
The person you're looking for
is not one of ours!

01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:34.143
No one's ever escaped from here.

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:40.149
Correct. But I'm working
from the exact opposite assumption.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:44.570
How can I explain...?

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:48.866
It isn't as if someone
got out of your institution,

01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.703
but rather got in!

01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:55.831
You've had such a case,
I believe.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:59.794
Yes, a curious incident,
it happened about 15 years ago,

01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:01.754
here on the lower basement level.

01:20:01.838 --> 01:20:04.632
Since, it's only been accessible
to members of the staff.

01:20:04.716 --> 01:20:06.801
The further down one goes
in this place

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:10.971
the more monstrous the inmates
become. It's probably the same in Hell.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:15.643
Until you reach the last circle,
the one without a centre.

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:36.121
Shit, Morris. I'm telling you,
I won't stay here a minute longer.

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:40.292
I want to come home
and don't have money for a ticket!

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.548
No, I ran away from school!

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:49.009
They wanted to lock me
in an institution!

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.095
What?

01:20:54.307 --> 01:20:56.183
It's a long story.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:59.562
Get me back to L.A.
and I'll tell you all about it.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:04.066
Which bank do you use in Zurich?
The S.K.A. What does it stand for?

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:05.568
Hello.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:08.988
Send me some money.
A telex in my name.

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.282
Do it, Morris!

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:13.701
I don't want to be murdered!

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:18.080
Yes, I said murder.

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:22.710
Someone here wants to kill me
and he's tried once already.

01:22:10.216 --> 01:22:14.261
I'm sorry,
there is nothing here in your name.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:17.473
- Are you sure?
- I'm afraid so.

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:22.770
Maybe it's just arrived and hasn't
come through the computers yet.

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.980
I can check.

01:22:31.154 --> 01:22:33.656
There is nothing. I'm sorry.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.159
Now what am I supposed to do?
This is an emergency.

01:22:37.243 --> 01:22:40.829
It could arrive at any time.
Look, why don't you come back later?

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:45.459
Where can I go in the meantime?
Can I wait here?

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:51.382
Sure, you can wait over there.
But, I suggest you go for a walk.

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.968
I'll wait.

01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:37.011
Hello, Jennifer!

01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:42.349
Your father's attorney Mr Shapiro
called us from New York.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.309
He was worried about you.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:49.481
And extremely angry with us
for, let's say, losing you.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.025
What a bastard!

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:53.277
He sounded reasonable
on the phone.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.446
He spoke to me,
and only calmed down

01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:58.115
when I told him
I would come for you myself.

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.451
He said I would find you here.

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:03.620
- I'm not going back to that school!
- Of course not.

01:24:03.747 --> 01:24:06.623
He said you want to go back
to America immediately. Is that true?

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.169
- Yes!
- He authorised me to buy your ticket

01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:14.006
and give you some money.
Is that all right?

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.760
- OK.
- Good.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:29.146
Good luck!

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.858
- What time is my flight?
- 12 noon tomorrow.

01:24:32.942 --> 01:24:35.360
The last flight out today
has already left.

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:40.157
What about tonight?
I'm not going to sleep at the school!

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:43.368
I'm not going back there,
I never want to see the place again!

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:46.580
Don't worry.
If that's what you want, it's all right.

01:24:46.664 --> 01:24:50.125
Mr Shapiro said to do whatever
you wanted.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:58.675
You can stay with me tonight.

01:24:59.677 --> 01:25:01.553
It's enormous!

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:04.139
- Do you live here alone?
- No.

01:25:24.035 --> 01:25:29.039
You'll sleep in here, Jennifer.
I hope you find it comfortable enough.

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:34.545
Looks fine, thank you.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.090
Why are the mirrors covered like that?

01:25:38.174 --> 01:25:41.218
I told you, I don't live alone.
I have a small son.

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.720
He's very sick.

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:48.392
I cover the mirrors for his sake.
He doesn't want to see his reflection.

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:54.523
I worry about him very much.
He's changed my life completely.

01:25:54.607 --> 01:25:58.485
Sometimes,
I think he's driving me crazy.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.612
I'm sorry.

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:03.740
These are things
that can happen in a woman's life.

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:06.827
But don't worry,
you won't see him.

01:26:06.911 --> 01:26:11.623
- Oh, I don't mind if...
- No! It's better if you don't.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:14.585
He stays in his room
with his crazy thoughts.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:18.589
Would you like something?
A cup of tea?

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:22.176
- No, I don't want to bother you.
- It's no bother!

01:27:12.268 --> 01:27:18.982
I'm sorry, I kicked the train by mistake.
It hit him. Maybe he's hurt!

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:21.109
Hurt?

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:26.740
- Don't grab him like that!
- Why not?!

01:27:26.824 --> 01:27:29.284
What on Earth are you thinking?

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:33.455
This is my son?
It's only a doll.

01:27:33.539 --> 01:27:38.418
You're a very sensitive young lady.
Are you frightened?

01:27:39.462 --> 01:27:42.339
- No, no.
- Yes, you are.

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:45.050
I can see it in your eyes.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.971
You're burning up!

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.181
- You have a fever!
- No, I don't!

01:27:51.266 --> 01:27:53.267
Yes, you do!

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.436
In this part of the country,
with this wind,

01:27:56.521 --> 01:28:00.232
it's hardly surprising.
I'll get you a pill.

01:28:00.316 --> 01:28:04.278
You don't want to leave
with a cold tomorrow do you?

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:07.489
Imagine what Mr Shapiro would say!

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:27.175
You should take them both.
But if you prefer, one is enough.

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.511
I don't want any pills!

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:34.224
May I use the bathroom?
The bathroom is over there.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:36.601
And you will take the pills!

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:42.065
- I never take medicine.
- You must take this. Trust me.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:45.027
Listen. I won't take anything.

01:28:46.946 --> 01:28:52.242
- What are the pills?
- They're for fever. They won't hurt.

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:57.164
Trust me. You have to take
this medicine. Do you understand?

01:28:57.248 --> 01:29:01.043
- You're hurting me. Let me go!
- Take them!

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:06.256
All right, I'll take the pills!

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:09.843
- I'll get you some water.
- I can get it myself!

01:29:10.928 --> 01:29:13.722
Shit, get out of the way!

01:29:15.808 --> 01:29:18.060
May I close the door?

01:29:24.776 --> 01:29:27.235
What a bitch!

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.703
Larvae of the Great Sarcophagus.

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:04.916
It lives exclusively off dead bodies,
human remains.

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:21.933
Poison!

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.088
- Jennifer, what are you doing?
- Poison!

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:57.469
Jennifer, answer me. Open the door!
I said what are you doing?

01:31:58.804 --> 01:32:02.599
Answer me, Jennifer!
Open the door this instant!

01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:10.398
Open the door!
Answer me!

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:13.443
How dare you behave like this!

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.741
Jennifer!

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:39.052
Let me in!

01:32:52.483 --> 01:32:55.610
Why didn't you open the door?
What were you doing?

01:32:55.695 --> 01:32:58.822
Did you take the pill?
What were you doing?

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:24.556
- Who are you calling?
- Morris, to tell him everything's fine.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.101
- Tomorrow.
- No, I want to do it now.

01:33:28.185 --> 01:33:33.023
Just a quick call. Let me go!

01:33:47.246 --> 01:33:52.083
I said no! You won't call anyone.
Do you understand? This is my house.

01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:55.128
You do what I say!

01:34:26.744 --> 01:34:29.454
Help! Help!

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:45.970
Stay there. And in a little while,
I'll kill you!

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:18.461
15 years ago when you were still
working in Basel, you were assaulted.

01:35:20.339 --> 01:35:23.091
Surely, you haven't forgotten
the incident?

01:35:23.175 --> 01:35:30.515
No. Look at this.
He pulled me to him through the bars.

01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:32.934
There were bars between us.

01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:36.646
I understand, Frau Brückner.
Forgive me.

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:39.607
But we have to be precise.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:44.279
You moved here
eight months ago, correct?

01:35:44.363 --> 01:35:48.074
Yes, that is so, Inspector.
Please, come this way.

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:52.829
And where were you living
before that?

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:55.123
Outside Zurich.

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.992
Perhaps the murderer
hides his victims.

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:33.995
He likes to keep
in physical contact with them.

01:36:34.079 --> 01:36:37.791
Conserving them.
He's a psychopath.

01:39:33.717 --> 01:39:35.551
- Mr Shapiro!
- Yes.

01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:38.805
The car rental agency,
your car is outside. Here's the key.

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:42.684
- Do you need a map, sir?
- No, thank you. I know the area.

01:39:51.193 --> 01:39:53.152
Jennifer!

01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:15.193
Hello?

01:41:31.376 --> 01:41:35.379
I'm Inspector Geiger.
I've come to help you!

01:41:42.471 --> 01:41:43.930
Help me!

01:42:13.502 --> 01:42:15.169
Thank you.

01:44:17.876 --> 01:44:22.171
- Go away, you scare me!
- I won't hurt you!

01:44:22.256 --> 01:44:24.590
I don't want you here.

01:44:24.675 --> 01:44:29.345
I know your mother was bad,
but I want to help!

01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:39.647
You don't have to worry
about the mirrors any more.

01:45:34.536 --> 01:45:37.079
No, please! No!

01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.738
- Morris!
- Jennifer?

01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:06.075
- Morris!
- Thank God!

01:51:16.461 --> 01:51:22.174
He was diseased
but he was my son.

01:51:22.258 --> 01:51:25.928
And you have...
Why didn't I kill you before?

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:31.517
I killed that inspector
and your professor friend,

01:51:31.601 --> 01:51:35.187
to protect him, and now...

01:51:35.271 --> 01:51:38.482
I'm going to kill you,
to avenge him!

01:51:39.317 --> 01:51:43.404
Why don't you call your insects?!
Go on!

01:51:43.488 --> 01:51:45.447
Call! Call!
