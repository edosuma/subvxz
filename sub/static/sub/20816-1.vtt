01:09.816 --> 01:14.905
<i>Bana. Once the most glorious
planet in all the universe,</i>

01:15.072 --> 01:18.950
<i>ruled by a beloved
king and queen.</i>

01:19.117 --> 01:23.955
<i>Under their rule, Bana
was a paradise.</i>

01:28.752 --> 01:32.631
<i>But darkness took hold.</i>

01:32.798 --> 01:38.303
<i>The king's envious brother, Zhong
unleashed the Space Kraken...</i>

01:40.347 --> 01:45.560
<i>an ancient beast with the
power to create black holes.</i>

02:18.969 --> 02:22.389
<i>Bana was shattered to pieces.</i>

02:22.556 --> 02:28.061
<i>The king and those loyal to him
were sucked into the Kraken slick</i>

02:28.228 --> 02:31.148
<i>along with your parents.</i>

02:31.314 --> 02:36.862
<i>And since that fateful day,
Zhong has ruled what remains of Bana</i>

02:37.029 --> 02:43.160
<i>with an iron fist,
enslaving everyone except for...</i>

02:43.162 --> 02:44.562
(snoring)

02:45.370 --> 02:47.539
Bananny?

02:50.876 --> 02:54.004
- Bananny?
- Except for...

02:54.130 --> 02:55.530
(snoring)

03:00.218 --> 03:02.506
Except for me, Chunk and Vix.

03:03.489 --> 03:04.889
You brought the three of us
here as kids,

03:04.973 --> 03:06.743
and we've been
hiding ever since,

03:07.121 --> 03:09.122
down here
in an underground bunker.

03:11.938 --> 03:13.705
When the Kraken let loose its slick,

03:13.944 --> 03:17.316
most of Bana was torn into
thousands of pieces called shards.

03:17.569 --> 03:21.448
Some shards disappeared into the slick,
but others were left behind.

03:21.615 --> 03:26.036
The farthest was used as a garbage dump,
and that's where we live,

03:26.203 --> 03:29.924
under a giant pile of trash.

03:30.499 --> 03:33.115
Stealing from Zhong just to get by.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.463
The end.

03:36.822 --> 03:39.048
(snoring)

03:48.642 --> 03:49.877
Good night, Bananny.

03:50.775 --> 03:52.163
Have a good sleep.

04:01.780 --> 04:04.074
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

04:04.241 --> 04:06.892
Yup, the big one three.

04:07.118 --> 04:09.228
That's like a thousand in
roach years isn't it?

04:17.212 --> 04:20.007
Shard, sweet shard.

05:32.245 --> 05:34.561
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Hey, buddy!

05:34.625 --> 05:36.489
We scored big time!

05:36.508 --> 05:39.769
We snagged a gravity module off the back
of Zhong's perimeter patrol unit.

05:39.836 --> 05:42.392
Just what I need to finish that P-E-C!

05:42.561 --> 05:43.561
P-E-C?

05:43.632 --> 05:45.107
A Polaron Energy Converter.

05:45.109 --> 05:48.409
Oh so cool.
I tell you his clowns almost caught us,

05:48.428 --> 05:52.516
but Vix lost them in a warp chase
through a shard field.  It was craz--

05:54.830 --> 05:57.301
It was, ah....
well, it was crazy boring.

05:57.437 --> 06:02.984
I mean, gravity modules,
who likes that stuff?  Hah...  right?

06:03.860 --> 06:07.656
- Mmh, what's this?
- No... no... nothing.  Just...  just junk.

06:11.034 --> 06:15.622
Uh. hey, oh, ah, careful with that.  Ah,
seriously, Spark, take it easy, you're gonna--

06:18.667 --> 06:21.420
ohh... hurt somebody.

06:25.465 --> 06:27.884
Aren't you supposed
to be in bed?

06:28.051 --> 06:30.328
After an awesome birthday
of you guys leaving me

06:30.353 --> 06:32.872
home alone to stare at the
stars with the roaches?

06:33.015 --> 06:36.309
I guess I was just
too excited to sleep.

06:36.476 --> 06:39.438
Sorry, Spark.
Happy birthday.

06:39.604 --> 06:42.986
I'm not a kid anymore,
I should be going on missions with you guys.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.674
Maybe next year.

06:49.692 --> 06:53.296
(sighs) I've been sitting on
this rock for 13 years.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.895
There's gotta be more
out there for me,

06:56.038 --> 06:57.218
like a purpose.

06:57.355 --> 06:59.358
I believe in you buddy.
I do.

06:59.583 --> 07:04.546
And I know Vix does,
in her irritated, never-gonna-admit-it kind of way.

07:04.713 --> 07:08.508
You've just gotta prove to her
that you're ready for more responsibility.

07:08.675 --> 07:09.694
How?

07:21.104 --> 07:22.898
All clear!

07:23.553 --> 07:26.438
Ah, oh, oh, ugh, oh, uh!

07:43.437 --> 07:45.935
Hai-yo-ahah!

07:46.129 --> 07:49.933
I hope you're hungry,
'cause you're about to taste bitter defeat.

07:50.526 --> 07:51.526
Tah!  Huh!

07:53.720 --> 07:57.018
Time to kick some asteroid.
Hi-ya!

08:03.019 --> 08:04.788
Hi-ya!

08:19.124 --> 08:20.124
Du-uh!

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
Ugh!

08:41.506 --> 08:42.506
Ushh!

08:42.770 --> 08:43.770
Ow!

08:43.395 --> 08:45.664
- Sorry, Chunk.
- Yeah, it's okay buddy.

08:45.731 --> 08:49.359
Are you hungry now?
'Cause you just got served.

08:49.526 --> 08:52.497
Combat is focus, Spark.
You have to find your center,

08:52.499 --> 08:55.226
your body's just flailing
all over the place.

08:56.721 --> 08:59.189
Hi-ya! Huh!  Hah!

08:59.461 --> 09:04.709
Wah!  Huh!  huh! ha!  Ugh!

09:06.977 --> 09:07.977
Ugh!

09:11.340 --> 09:13.091
Focus!

09:14.217 --> 09:17.679
Uh, I think I just pulled a muscle...
in my entire body.

09:17.846 --> 09:20.034
Let me give you a hand there,
Sparkster.

09:22.591 --> 09:23.591
Duhh!

09:23.894 --> 09:25.541
Cool huh?

09:26.563 --> 09:29.503
I finished that holographic replicator
I was workin' on.

09:33.820 --> 09:37.783
It's not fair.  My throat's sore,
I didn't eat breakfast, I have a...

09:37.949 --> 09:40.591
ah, I gotta ah, ah--
Hey, you know what?  You're cheating!

09:40.593 --> 09:41.641
That's what it is.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.667
No one's cheating, Spark.

09:43.830 --> 09:45.879
I  just don't think
you're old enough yet.

09:45.881 --> 09:47.767
I am a thousand in roach years!

09:48.126 --> 09:50.875
Well I'll keep that in mind
when we go to war with the bugs.

09:51.267 --> 09:52.467
Tss-ah!

10:03.809 --> 10:05.894
Why he is acting like this?

10:06.061 --> 10:08.844
Well, he's undergoing major
myelination in synaptic pruning

10:08.869 --> 10:11.565
in the orbital frontal cortex
in excited neuratory transmiitters.

10:11.608 --> 10:15.569
All of which have massive  implications
on risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom.

10:16.387 --> 10:17.365
What?

10:17.816 --> 10:19.216
He's a teenager.

11:31.815 --> 11:32.815
Mmm.

11:34.566 --> 11:37.027
Yes...  yes...

11:37.194 --> 11:40.113
A perfect likeness!

11:40.280 --> 11:43.825
Permission to proceed
with the full-scale build.

11:44.519 --> 11:45.519
(sighs)

11:46.328 --> 11:49.748
You know, they called
my brother many things...

11:49.915 --> 11:52.459
selfless ruler...

11:52.626 --> 11:55.587
empathetic king...

11:57.798 --> 12:00.801
loving monarch...

12:01.635 --> 12:05.055
but they never called him...

12:05.222 --> 12:08.058
...destroyer of planet.

12:09.184 --> 12:13.438
Ooh, that's good.
That's really...

12:13.605 --> 12:17.609
What?  Lowercase?

12:17.776 --> 12:21.196
Small?  What are you saying?

12:21.363 --> 12:25.534
N-n-n-nothing.  It was an oversight,
Your Eternal Malevolency.  I swear.

12:25.701 --> 12:31.039
A small oversight?  Mmm?
It's that it?  You think I'm small?

12:31.206 --> 12:33.500
- Oh n-n-no, Your Imperial--
- What?

12:33.667 --> 12:37.339
What's wrong with being small?
Is there something wrong with that?

12:37.872 --> 12:38.579
Nothing at all.

12:38.672 --> 12:40.185
Okay, so I am small then.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.992
I seem small to you.
That's what you saying?

12:43.135 --> 12:47.435
Yes. Aah... I mean no.
I mean I wanna fix it  right away, ahh--

12:47.472 --> 12:49.266
Koko!

13:02.995 --> 13:04.395
Ooouuh!

13:04.573 --> 13:06.337
I regret nothing!

13:11.121 --> 13:14.124
Ke-ah, third artist this week.

13:17.127 --> 13:22.132
Oh m'lady!
Do I have a surprise for you.

13:22.299 --> 13:25.052
Not another jaywalker's head
on a pike.

13:25.218 --> 13:30.015
No no. Much better than that.
Much better.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.601
Mmmh.

13:32.893 --> 13:35.729
Ha?  What do you think?

13:35.896 --> 13:41.902
It has a much better ring to it, doesn't it?
Destroyer of the planets.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.320
(sighs)

13:43.904 --> 13:46.434
You're going to destroy
 another planet?

13:46.744 --> 13:49.544
(maniacally laughing)

13:50.577 --> 13:52.153
Behold!

13:57.876 --> 14:00.234
I found another Kraken finder.

14:01.071 --> 14:02.071
How?

14:02.130 --> 14:06.718
Well let's just say 13 years of search minions.
searching and minioning,

14:06.885 --> 14:08.880
has finally paid off.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.805
It's been exhausting for me.   Really.

14:13.390 --> 14:15.119
What exactly are you planning?

14:15.185 --> 14:17.434
Nothing much.
Just finding the Kraken,

14:17.459 --> 14:19.130
destroying another planet

14:19.272 --> 14:23.023
and having the rest of the universe
bow before me in fear!

14:23.276 --> 14:27.739
That's all.
Zhong will rule all!

14:28.161 --> 14:31.127
(maniacally laughing)

14:56.935 --> 14:59.271
Why Koko laugh?

15:08.002 --> 15:09.002
Hi-ya!

15:21.877 --> 15:23.940
The rogue space
prodigy Spark,

15:23.965 --> 15:26.696
has demolished every foe that
dares cross his path.

15:26.715 --> 15:30.427
Until he comes face to face
with pure evil in a  black form.

15:30.806 --> 15:35.182
Zhong, you tore this planet apart.
You've took my parents.

15:35.349 --> 15:37.357
I just have one thing
to say to you:

15:37.495 --> 15:39.250
your rule is over!

15:45.650 --> 15:49.196
Woah, almost took your
head off there, Floyd.

15:49.953 --> 15:52.035
You're lucky
I have cat-like reflexes.

15:58.497 --> 16:00.525
You guys
really love bananas huh?

16:02.793 --> 16:06.338
So what do you think?
Do you think I'm ready?

16:09.508 --> 16:13.238
One day I'll show them.
I'll show everyone.

17:09.859 --> 17:13.780
Adventure's overrated, dear.

17:13.946 --> 17:16.282
Yeah,  sure.

17:16.450 --> 17:22.122
How about a glass of nice, warm milk?
Just how you like it.

17:36.287 --> 17:37.287
(sighs)

17:42.976 --> 17:47.272
Can I have some of those cookies?
You know, the ones with the sprinkles on top?

17:47.439 --> 17:50.776
Of course you can, Snookums.

18:15.045 --> 18:16.045
(sighs)

18:22.821 --> 18:25.652
Huh,  oooh. (inhales)

19:04.224 --> 19:08.562
"Vix, I realize the risk,
but we must meet immediately.

19:08.729 --> 19:12.733
"These instructions will lead yo
to a rendezvous point.  Follow them.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.049
This is of the utmost importance."

19:33.003 --> 19:35.589
What is this?  Soap?

19:38.258 --> 19:40.186
Hey guys! beautiful day huh?

19:40.294 --> 19:41.294
Hey buddy!

19:41.803 --> 19:45.014
Man, you must really tired
after an all-night mission like that,

19:45.140 --> 19:46.828
you should get some sleep.

19:49.113 --> 19:52.183
Mmh, I'm just gonna work on those pointers
you gave me the other day.

19:52.606 --> 19:55.404
You know, focusing, thinking
exfoliating, whatever.

19:55.406 --> 19:56.815
Okay. bye bye, toodaloo.

19:57.027 --> 19:58.027
Doah!

19:59.654 --> 20:01.311
Who put that there?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.193
All right!

20:05.619 --> 20:07.472
What's gotten into him?

20:09.028 --> 20:11.534
(snoring)

20:13.187 --> 20:14.187
Ech!

21:09.016 --> 21:12.227
Okay, Bananastar.
Engage silent mode and set course for Bana.

21:12.394 --> 21:14.638
Please push the on button.

21:14.811 --> 21:18.339
Ah, on button?
Right... okay.   Ah--

21:19.526 --> 21:22.154
Mmmh. On button.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.389
Thanks, Floyd.
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.235
Eh, you got a point.

21:33.749 --> 21:36.501
Ah, here we go.

22:46.571 --> 22:48.005
The royal palace?

22:48.229 --> 22:50.047
Okay, I was not expecting this.

22:51.618 --> 22:53.962
So the access point is...

22:57.082 --> 23:00.419
a sewer.
That really stinks.

23:02.254 --> 23:04.506
Okay.
Here we go.

23:08.510 --> 23:12.681
Throwing in
three... two... one.

23:30.073 --> 23:33.110
Hey chimps!
Who let you out of the zoo?

23:41.126 --> 23:43.378
Hey there banana-breath!

23:53.221 --> 23:56.224
You wanna see a magic trick?

23:57.581 --> 23:58.581
- A Trick?
- Uh.

24:10.113 --> 24:13.909
"Press the green banana" ?
What?

24:14.336 --> 24:15.336
(clearing throat)

24:16.319 --> 24:17.319
Oh...

24:17.746 --> 24:21.054
Hey guys!
The royal plumber here.

24:21.302 --> 24:23.945
Yup, those pipes
are gonna have to be replaced.

24:24.190 --> 24:26.533
I think Zhong's not getting enough fiber.

24:26.572 --> 24:28.131
If you know what I mean.

24:29.132 --> 24:30.502
Get him!

24:48.902 --> 24:52.085
Intruder alert!
Seal all halls on 20.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.877
Press the green banana!

25:19.486 --> 25:22.924
Ouch!  Okay, okay, you got me.
Please don't shoot.

25:22.974 --> 25:23.974
Oh...

25:25.022 --> 25:27.816
it's just a door handle.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.480
Huh!

25:48.754 --> 25:51.798
Why are you here?
Where are Vix and Chunk?

25:51.965 --> 25:56.678
Um. they were ah, busy...
so, ah, I came instead.

25:57.429 --> 26:00.932
- I told them never to--
- Excuse me, Your Queeniness.

26:01.099 --> 26:06.396
Wait. You're the queen? Zhong's queen?
You sent for Vix and Chunk?

26:06.563 --> 26:09.524
I-I don't understand.

26:13.695 --> 26:15.784
Sorry to disturb you, m'lady.

26:15.809 --> 26:19.266
And might I say, you look
lovely this evening.

26:19.461 --> 26:21.017
No, get on with it.

26:21.019 --> 26:22.019
Right, okay.

26:22.162 --> 26:26.416
There's been a break-in, so, ah,
we're gonna have to search your room.

26:27.068 --> 26:29.628
Zhong's order.
Can we come in?

26:29.795 --> 26:32.124
You can get lost.

26:33.131 --> 26:36.551
We have very little time.
Here, take this.

26:36.718 --> 26:38.016
What is it?

26:38.207 --> 26:39.568
A Kraken finder.

26:41.775 --> 26:43.558
<i>Open this door, please</i>

26:43.725 --> 26:45.047
Give it to Vix and Chunk.

26:45.205 --> 26:47.505
Hide it and make sure it's
never found again.

26:47.521 --> 26:50.243
<i>We are gonna have to,
ah, break the door down.</i>

26:50.245 --> 26:52.947
The fate of the universe
depends on you.

26:53.694 --> 26:56.780
<i>We're coming in. So sorry.
Please don't hit us m'lady.</i>

26:56.947 --> 27:00.635
I-I don't get it.
You're supposed to be on Zhong's side.

27:00.740 --> 27:04.145
Things aren't always
what they seem, Spark.

27:06.735 --> 27:07.735
Hah!

27:08.750 --> 27:11.566
How dare you
interrupt my bath!

27:11.754 --> 27:13.754
Oh so sorry,
Your Queenliness

27:13.755 --> 27:14.913
Listen you imbeciles,

27:14.938 --> 27:19.009
you will escort this handmaid outside
the castle grounds and ask no questions.

27:19.011 --> 27:21.178
You will sweep the castle
grounds twice,

27:21.180 --> 27:24.715
give yourselves 40 lashes
and bring me a fruit bowl.

27:24.725 --> 27:25.708
Is that clear?

27:25.710 --> 27:28.210
- Oh very much so.
- Yes, indeed.

27:28.228 --> 27:30.628
If you do not follow
these royal commands,

27:30.630 --> 27:33.048
your insolence
will be report to Zhong.

27:47.873 --> 27:49.356
Don't ask.

27:53.462 --> 27:55.093
Wait till you see this, Floyd.

27:56.493 --> 27:59.125
It's the fate of the universe.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.993
It will give Zhong ultimate power,

28:04.673 --> 28:05.673
but...

28:06.433 --> 28:11.389
in the right hands,
maybe it can take that power away.

28:13.398 --> 28:17.068
Maybe... maybe that person
could do to Zhong

28:17.072 --> 28:19.172
what Zhong did to all of Bana.

28:22.908 --> 28:25.229
Let's go find us a Kraken!

28:25.464 --> 28:27.401
Bananastar, take us
to the deep space.

28:27.454 --> 28:29.500
<i>Please push the on button.</i>

28:29.502 --> 28:30.702
Oh, okay, got it.

28:42.678 --> 28:46.515
Okay, Kraken finder,
find us the Kraken.

28:48.975 --> 28:51.728
Okay, anytime now.
Let's go.

28:53.146 --> 28:55.357
It didn't come
with instructions.

29:09.579 --> 29:11.331
Oh no!

29:11.498 --> 29:14.626
No, Mr. Mangoise needs
banana cream.

29:16.712 --> 29:18.412
Chunk, wake up!

29:24.386 --> 29:26.350
Penn ate the pot stickers?

29:26.568 --> 29:28.506
Spark went to the palace.

29:28.508 --> 29:30.316
He... he has a Kraken finder.

29:31.643 --> 29:34.083
Spark ate the pot stickers?

29:38.525 --> 29:40.182
To the Kraken.

29:42.612 --> 29:45.240
Come on, Kraken!

29:48.368 --> 29:49.827
Kraken!

29:51.542 --> 29:53.275
What's it gonna take
to get you working?

29:57.627 --> 30:03.258
So a little Kraken finder said
"I think I can, I think I can."

30:04.343 --> 30:06.025
Clear!

30:06.657 --> 30:07.957
Doa!  Uh.

30:09.097 --> 30:11.224
Tahh, stupid rock!

30:21.568 --> 30:26.615
<i>Koko!
My Kraken finder's been stolen.</i>

30:26.782 --> 30:29.636
<i>You search every inch
of every shard in the system</i>

30:29.864 --> 30:31.464
<i> until you find it.</i>

30:31.536 --> 30:33.841
<i>If you come back empty-handed,</i>

30:34.281 --> 30:37.352
<i>Smackery Koko for you!
Got it?</i>

30:39.461 --> 30:42.189
Koko should have
taken modeling job.

30:52.474 --> 30:54.006
What's that rattling?

30:54.136 --> 30:55.936
Bananastar, run a diagnostic.

30:56.019 --> 31:00.565
<i>All system normal,
source of disruption located on deck.</i>

31:00.732 --> 31:02.550
On deck? Where?

31:02.690 --> 31:04.047
<i>Behind you.</i>

31:33.473 --> 31:35.225
Yes...  yes!

31:36.601 --> 31:38.700
Kraken, here I come!

31:48.613 --> 31:50.449
Huh, must be getting close.

31:57.039 --> 31:58.705
In there?

32:00.125 --> 32:02.851
Okay.
Bananastar, takes us in.

32:03.061 --> 32:04.485
<i>Taking us in.</i>

32:20.979 --> 32:22.259
Activate sonar.

32:22.261 --> 32:24.083
<i>Activating sonar.</i>

32:48.465 --> 32:52.094
Whatever that is...
it's big.

32:56.181 --> 32:58.093
It's right on top of us.

33:13.191 --> 33:14.191
Daah!

33:21.456 --> 33:23.917
Ew!   Oh boy!

33:24.084 --> 33:26.774
For a minute there, I thought we
found the thing and I was like...

33:26.799 --> 33:29.211
maybe this
wasn't such a great idea.

34:41.274 --> 34:43.105
Ah! Reverse thrusters!

34:43.130 --> 34:46.456
<i>I'm sorry I don't understand
the "seekers dusters".</i>

34:46.500 --> 34:47.880
Evasive maneuvers!

34:47.906 --> 34:51.612
<i>Searching data base
for "abrasive manure".</i>

35:14.319 --> 35:17.698
I think...
I think it likes you, Bananastar.

35:17.864 --> 35:20.477
<i>This is very awkward for me.</i>

35:20.951 --> 35:23.128
You are lot bigger than I thought.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.656
Tractor beams are
not gonna work on you.

35:27.249 --> 35:28.981
Bananastar, set course for home.

35:28.983 --> 35:31.545
<i>Setting course for garbage shard.</i>

35:32.462 --> 35:33.959
Slowly.

35:47.185 --> 35:50.939
I can't believe it!
I did it!  I did it!

36:20.844 --> 36:22.134
You stay there girl.

36:22.159 --> 36:25.706
I'm about to give my friends
the surprize of a lifetime.

36:35.484 --> 36:36.917
What?

36:38.362 --> 36:39.863
No!

36:44.076 --> 36:46.703
Vix!
Chunk!

36:47.700 --> 36:48.700
<i>Oooh.</i>

36:48.997 --> 36:50.327
Bananny!

36:54.044 --> 36:57.488
Spark, they took Vix and Chunk.

36:57.490 --> 36:58.490
Who?

36:58.757 --> 37:03.553
How about one last glass of...

37:03.720 --> 37:07.057
warm milk.

37:11.061 --> 37:12.250
No!

37:20.946 --> 37:23.131
No! no no no!

37:25.033 --> 37:28.240
Boss going to be happy.

37:44.845 --> 37:47.639
So are you and Zimtron
still coming over for dinner?

37:47.806 --> 37:49.018
Her name is Gort.

37:49.227 --> 37:50.427
Right, sorry.

37:52.686 --> 37:54.165
She have any food allergies?

37:54.167 --> 37:56.128
 Pineapple gives her gas.

38:00.777 --> 38:02.541
Oh, what have I done?

38:02.704 --> 38:04.807
<i>You messed up big-time
is what you did.</i>

38:04.906 --> 38:06.742
Vix!
Chunk!

38:06.908 --> 38:07.907
How could you?

38:07.909 --> 38:08.909
I-I'm sorry.  I--

38:08.911 --> 38:09.911
Sorry?

38:09.455 --> 38:11.687
I don't think you
understand what you--

38:12.914 --> 38:19.880
Your Kingpin Superintendent High Priestess...
The Mighty Zhong!

38:22.758 --> 38:24.176
Oh boy!

38:24.364 --> 38:30.398
Phewm!  Can you smell that?
That's the stench of garbage.

38:30.557 --> 38:35.103
Koko found them on the garbage shard.
Imagine that.

38:35.270 --> 38:39.608
They actually live
on that dung heap in our filth.

38:39.775 --> 38:46.531
And yet somehow they managed
to survive and steal from me!

38:46.698 --> 38:50.660
Thank you...   Spark is it?

38:50.827 --> 38:53.747
For saving me the effort of
capturing the Kraken

38:53.814 --> 38:57.359
and delivering it to my doorstep
free of charge.

38:57.626 --> 39:02.839
The last time I used the Kraken;
who incidentally tore this planet apart,

39:03.006 --> 39:06.009
I lost it soon after.

39:06.176 --> 39:09.680
They're difficult to train.
So stubborn.

39:09.846 --> 39:14.398
You can't be like:
"Kraken, sit.  Sit, Kraken.   Stay!"

39:14.423 --> 39:16.085
 They don't listen.

39:16.228 --> 39:20.482
So I just use a
torturous force field instead.

39:24.986 --> 39:30.909
With the press of a button, voilà!
Instant Kraken sticks

39:31.076 --> 39:35.038
It's like having a world-destroying weapon
at your fingertips.

39:35.205 --> 39:38.333
And three days from now...

39:38.500 --> 39:42.629
I'll be using it
to destroy another planet.

39:44.840 --> 39:49.858
Ah!  Here comes
my first test subject now.

39:50.887 --> 39:52.542
The garbage shard!

39:52.707 --> 39:54.685
Indeed.

40:25.213 --> 40:29.426
It's time to take out the trash.

40:32.387 --> 40:34.222
No!

41:07.964 --> 41:12.678
We're-we're alive!
The slick must have acted like a wormhole.

41:12.844 --> 41:13.877
So that's means?

41:14.089 --> 41:16.153
Ah, that means
we could be anywhere.

41:17.229 --> 41:21.129
Oh... yeah...  uh... oh.

41:21.186 --> 41:25.123
Happy now?
You got what you wanted right?  Uuh!

41:26.358 --> 41:30.604
Adventure?
You're a real hero

41:30.818 --> 41:32.018
I'm sorry.

41:32.197 --> 41:34.931
Sorry? Are you going to
apologize to the planet

41:34.956 --> 41:37.518
that's about to be
destroyed because of you?

41:37.661 --> 41:40.264
Are you going to apologize
to the entire universe

41:40.266 --> 41:42.481
for handing it over to Zhong?
Are you?

41:42.624 --> 41:44.831
Go ahead.
I'm sure that will help.

41:44.833 --> 41:48.432
I'm sure that will
make everything just fine!

41:52.843 --> 41:54.765
I was on your side.

41:58.056 --> 41:59.759
Vix, wait up!

42:03.645 --> 42:05.029
Vix!

42:09.151 --> 42:10.861
We should've told him.

42:11.101 --> 42:16.015
I wanted to tell him, everyday
for the past 13 years, I've wanted to.

42:17.325 --> 42:19.056
Me too
- (sighs)

42:22.497 --> 42:24.207
This is my fault.

42:25.917 --> 42:27.357
I failed.

42:29.087 --> 42:30.575
We both did.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.526
We weren't trained for this.

42:34.882 --> 42:36.422
We certainly weren't.

42:38.296 --> 42:40.720
Well, let's tell him.

42:42.768 --> 42:44.686
Spark?

42:44.853 --> 42:46.938
Spark!

42:48.857 --> 42:51.234
Spark!

43:13.715 --> 43:16.134
The garbage shard.

43:20.055 --> 43:22.819
Floyd! Floyd, you made it!

43:23.016 --> 43:25.838
Ha, it's so good to
see a friendly face.

43:28.021 --> 43:29.731
What?

43:34.361 --> 43:37.030
I...  come in peace.

43:38.323 --> 43:40.409
Spark!
- Spark!

43:42.202 --> 43:44.246
Spark!

43:45.739 --> 43:47.070
What's that sound?

43:47.228 --> 43:48.587
What's that?

43:51.253 --> 43:56.008
Well I did sneak a couple of
candy bars after lunch.   (laughs)

43:56.174 --> 43:58.010
Oh, that sound.

44:11.880 --> 44:12.880
(scream)

44:14.890 --> 44:16.190
Ah-haah!

44:16.778 --> 44:20.365
What do we have here?
Where'd you come from, boy?

44:20.532 --> 44:22.145
Through a Kraken slick?

44:22.457 --> 44:25.888
(laughs)   A Kraken slick?
That's impossible!

44:26.371 --> 44:30.075
Ah, sir?
Ah,  we came through a Kraken slick.

44:30.204 --> 44:33.628
Huh?  Oh right.
You've got a point, Ted.

44:33.795 --> 44:35.563
How'd you
end up in the slick?

44:36.306 --> 44:37.281
I was thrown in?

44:37.291 --> 44:38.187
By who?

44:38.217 --> 44:39.433
His name was..

44:40.054 --> 44:41.054
Zhong.

44:41.056 --> 44:42.766
Zhong?

44:44.056 --> 44:45.009
You know him?

44:45.011 --> 44:47.620
He tore our planet apart.

44:48.810 --> 44:50.282
This used to be a part
of Bana?

44:50.320 --> 44:51.520
Aye.

44:52.230 --> 44:54.369
I can't believe it!
I'm from Bana.

44:54.559 --> 44:56.143
It still exists?

44:56.234 --> 45:00.489
Yes.  Well... what's left of it does.
And it's ruled by Zhong.

45:00.655 --> 45:03.271
That cretin.

45:04.284 --> 45:07.704
Come with us.
I want to hear more.

45:12.668 --> 45:18.590
I was captain of the Royal Guard.
The soldiers you met were my men.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.533
Or what's left of them.

45:20.652 --> 45:24.542
And this, this is where we've lived
for the past...

45:24.638 --> 45:25.847
13 years.

45:25.852 --> 45:27.252
Has it been that?

45:27.891 --> 45:29.956
Feels like an eternity.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.866
It's like a thousand
in roach years.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.870
Don't worry
about the lightning.

45:35.895 --> 45:38.771
It strikes randomly.
You'll get used to it.

45:38.865 --> 45:40.316
I don't even feel it.

45:46.368 --> 45:48.652
See?
It's nothing.

45:49.037 --> 45:51.257
Now, would somebody
please tell me who I am?

45:51.431 --> 45:53.800
Ah, you're the captain.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.782
And what are these?

45:55.838 --> 45:57.038
Those are your hands.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.840
Smashing.

46:02.175 --> 46:06.930
Even if the ship worked, it would take
lifetimes to fly back.

46:07.097 --> 46:11.176
No, you are
officially lost in space, my boy.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.620
Roasted space rat?

46:14.733 --> 46:16.155
No, thanks.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.427
I'm telling you,
this is as good as it gets.

46:20.501 --> 46:21.701
Ach!   Yuck.

46:22.154 --> 46:25.866
Yup, this is about as far from everything
as anyone's ever been.

46:26.033 --> 46:29.978
And I can tell you
right now that--  Ha?

46:37.010 --> 46:38.048
What?

46:38.141 --> 46:41.521
Your hand... it's... it's...

46:41.631 --> 46:43.057
It's a birthmark.

46:43.444 --> 46:44.906
But it can't be!

46:44.926 --> 46:46.834
Don't you realize
what this is?

46:47.176 --> 46:49.194
A.... birthmark?

46:58.065 --> 47:01.860
The seal of
the royal family.

47:06.323 --> 47:09.214
Only those in this bloodline
are born with the mark.

47:09.239 --> 47:11.977
Your Royal Highness.

47:13.497 --> 47:17.542
Fortune be praised.
I never dared hope.

47:18.335 --> 47:22.871
The last I saw of you was the Queen
instructing Bananny to spirit you away

47:22.873 --> 47:27.658
to some remote shard
until the day arrived when fate would beckon.

47:27.867 --> 47:30.639
You... you know Bananny?

47:32.891 --> 47:36.812
If the king is my father,
that's means my mother is...

47:36.978 --> 47:39.398
He's your son?

47:39.564 --> 47:42.195
- No!
- I thought he was dead.

47:45.491 --> 47:48.699
Owww!
Why do you have such good aim?

47:51.827 --> 47:55.056
I'm beginning to think
this isn't working out between us.

47:56.415 --> 48:00.210
Do you really not get how much I hate you?
And always have.

48:00.377 --> 48:03.135
I thought that was just
what couples did.

48:06.758 --> 48:08.938
Bringing us an heir is
really out of the question?

48:12.848 --> 48:18.368
Put her in solitary confinement
until I have a Kraken slick to throw her into.

48:19.229 --> 48:21.002
Nothing happened here.

48:31.283 --> 48:35.322
During the first few years here
things were tough.

48:35.693 --> 48:37.855
And the
storms were vicious.

48:37.998 --> 48:42.377
There was a tremendous flood that
wiped-out our entire village.

48:42.544 --> 48:46.715
Your father worked tirelessly to
get everyone to safety.

48:46.882 --> 48:51.470
And just as he lifted the
last person on to one of the rafts,

48:51.636 --> 48:53.652
lightning struck the water.

48:54.890 --> 48:59.853
He was the bravest, most selfless
monkey I've ever known.

49:00.020 --> 49:03.231
He gave everything
for his people...

49:03.398 --> 49:05.715
including his life.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.701
I wager you'd
like some privacy.

49:14.785 --> 49:17.496
This wasn't how
it was supposed to happen, Dad.

49:18.372 --> 49:20.267
I was supposed find you guys,

49:20.716 --> 49:22.587
and we'd be this great family.

49:23.585 --> 49:25.055
But you're gone.

49:26.132 --> 49:27.905
I messed up.

49:28.173 --> 49:30.597
I messed up bad.

49:31.279 --> 49:32.660
I'm sorry.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.736
Showtime!

49:51.321 --> 49:54.282
Hello, fellow rulers of planets.

49:54.449 --> 49:59.371
This is Emperor
High Intercontinental Champion Zhong.

49:59.538 --> 50:03.542
Just following-up on that message
I sent you a little while back.

50:03.709 --> 50:08.005
You know the one:
about me taking control of your planets!

50:08.171 --> 50:09.958
I thought you might
like to know

50:09.960 --> 50:12.355
that I've  got
my Kraken in custody

50:12.537 --> 50:14.887
and things are
moving along nicely.

50:18.140 --> 50:21.184
You know the drill,
hand your worlds over to me,

50:21.351 --> 50:24.730
or I destroy them
with the Kraken slick!

50:29.693 --> 50:33.155
And to show you
that I mean business:

50:33.321 --> 50:37.793
I'm going to
open a slick right near...

50:38.183 --> 50:39.183
you!

50:42.039 --> 50:44.362
Okay, so we have a few things
to get ready first,

50:44.553 --> 50:47.715
and we'll be right over
to destroy your planet.

50:48.136 --> 50:49.694
I'll see you in a little bit.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.550
Oh...  yes!

50:54.676 --> 50:58.305
Anyone up for some lunch?
Something to eat?   Anyone?

50:59.431 --> 51:01.967
Ah, sure-sure I guess so.
- Sure.  Sure.

51:02.214 --> 51:07.939
Market shop?   (-Okay.)   Yeah?   Okay?
Who's driving?   Who's got the keys?

51:19.409 --> 51:22.295
I never thought it
would end this way, Vix.

51:22.305 --> 51:23.983
Neither did I, Chunk.

51:24.539 --> 51:26.378
You mean you
really think it's going to end this way?

51:26.496 --> 51:28.337
That's means
it's really going to end this way.

51:28.702 --> 51:30.900
No!

51:36.968 --> 51:41.223
Vix, Chunk...
what do I do?

51:41.390 --> 51:42.612
<i>You save them.</i>

51:43.922 --> 51:45.815
Floyd, you can talk?

51:53.485 --> 51:55.221
<i>Spark.</i>

51:55.377 --> 51:56.677
Father?

51:56.780 --> 51:58.703
<i>Your friends are in danger.</i>

51:58.887 --> 51:59.687
Where?

51:59.783 --> 52:03.453
<i>Trapped in a cave north of the gorge.
Save them.</i>

52:05.664 --> 52:09.167
But I'm no hero.
I've messed up everything I've ever done.

52:09.636 --> 52:12.771
<i>Without failure, there is no growth.</i>

52:13.173 --> 52:14.812
But I might fail again.

52:15.048 --> 52:19.428
<i>You must be the spark of hope
for people to believe in.</i>

52:19.594 --> 52:23.682
<i>That is your purpose and
place in the universe.</i>

52:23.849 --> 52:30.480
<i>Fate brought you here for a reason.
Rise, Spark!   Rise!</i>

52:57.121 --> 52:58.321
Whoah!

53:17.065 --> 53:18.265
Ohh!

53:18.570 --> 53:20.190
Over here!

53:21.239 --> 53:23.204
Leave my friends alone!

53:24.409 --> 53:27.137
Spark, no!
Get out of here.  Go now!

53:27.204 --> 53:30.626
Don't worry I've a chance so long
as I have this.

53:33.627 --> 53:36.956
Oh...  well, this is gonna be
a little more difficult.

53:47.283 --> 53:48.483
Ugh!

53:48.975 --> 53:50.626
I can't look!

54:31.893 --> 54:36.982
Father, if I ever needed your strength,
it's now.

55:20.442 --> 55:23.695
Back, all of you!

55:28.658 --> 55:30.637
Now, turn your backs!

55:36.750 --> 55:38.794
Way to go, Floyd.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.756
I-I can't believe it!
Tha-that was amazing!

55:43.429 --> 55:46.718
Heh!  Let's get out of here
before they change their minds.

55:46.885 --> 55:48.720
- Yawo!
- Sorry.

55:49.805 --> 55:54.726
Now I know some of you have a cold right now.
And Ted you have no legs.

55:54.893 --> 55:58.397
But the prince of Bana is out there
and he needs us.

55:58.563 --> 55:59.781
It's okay, I'm alright.

56:00.683 --> 56:03.255
Your Highness. Thank--

56:03.318 --> 56:07.572
Is that... indeed?
Indeed!

56:07.739 --> 56:09.908
- Lieutenant Vix.
- Captain!

56:10.075 --> 56:12.285
Chunkinator!

56:13.829 --> 56:17.473
Still watching
your waistline I see.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.920
Lieutenant Vix?   Chunkinator?

56:22.087 --> 56:24.089
Your Highness?

56:27.300 --> 56:30.137
We were the youngest
members of the Royal Guard.

56:30.303 --> 56:35.475
13 years ago, we were sworn to secrecy,
assigned by the queen to protect you.

56:35.642 --> 56:40.063
Our mission was to hide you,
keep you safe, train and prepare you.

56:40.579 --> 56:41.836
The queen always felt

56:41.838 --> 56:44.735
she'd find a way to put things right again
and take Bana back.

56:44.799 --> 56:48.155
And when that time came,
you would be ready.

56:48.321 --> 56:51.825
I am.   We all are.
Now we just have to get back.

56:53.910 --> 56:56.855
Oh come on!
We made the trip once, how did we do it?

56:56.944 --> 56:58.302
By Kraken slick.

56:58.373 --> 57:01.197
So to get back, we will need
another Kraken slick.

57:01.993 --> 57:03.093
Ha-ha-ha!

57:03.128 --> 57:04.150
What's funny?

57:04.175 --> 57:07.239
So we're just gonna go
jump in a slick and  go home?

57:07.382 --> 57:11.386
- Why not?
- Well to begin with, we're fresh out of Kraken.

57:11.553 --> 57:14.768
And I don't think the little
guy counts as one.

57:18.143 --> 57:19.712
What if we mde our own slick?

57:19.732 --> 57:23.692
Oh, of course,
why didn't I think of that?

57:23.694 --> 57:25.059
No, seriously.

57:25.145 --> 57:27.158
What is a Kraken slick?
What is it made of?

57:27.214 --> 57:28.461
Polaron energy.

57:28.648 --> 57:30.877
Polaron energy.
We can harness that, can't we?

57:30.947 --> 57:34.306
- By "we", you mean "me" right?
- Of course.

57:34.308 --> 57:37.222
Well for us to return to
Bana...

57:37.682 --> 57:40.731
we would need to replicate the exact
vibrational frequency

57:40.874 --> 57:44.086
of the subatomic particles excreted
from that particular Kraken.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.380
No idea what it means,
keep going.

57:46.546 --> 57:48.896
Which will be nearly impossible because
we'd need a power source

57:48.921 --> 57:51.725
capable of generating a burst
of a concentrated tachyon particles,

57:51.727 --> 57:54.730
allowing us to open a
temporary rift in relative space-time.

57:54.732 --> 57:56.580
So.. big power source?

57:56.582 --> 57:57.977
Crazy big!

57:59.101 --> 58:01.495
Ah, Chunk,
I think you might wanna--

58:11.279 --> 58:12.927
Crazy big enough?

58:13.315 --> 58:15.929
Ahh... yeah.
Aw, but...

58:16.043 --> 58:17.133
What?

58:17.207 --> 58:19.889
I would need something
like the P-E-C.

58:20.038 --> 58:21.269
Polaron Energy Converter.

58:21.294 --> 58:24.984
Yeah... which is back on the garbage shard,
which is-- who knows where now?

58:26.087 --> 58:28.889
Captain! Prepare a search party.

58:28.891 --> 58:31.141
Something's stuck to
the end of my leg.

58:31.326 --> 58:32.828
Those will be your feet.

58:33.474 --> 58:34.574
Outstanding.

58:38.098 --> 58:40.379
Hey, and take anything else
you can find.

58:40.381 --> 58:42.681
Wiring, converters, engine parts...
<i>- Is this what you're looking for, sir?</i>

58:42.769 --> 58:47.649
Cold-cuts, dessert items.
You never know.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.556
We need to start
on a plan.

58:51.336 --> 58:53.404
The battleship
takes on Zhong's warship.

58:53.516 --> 58:55.261
The speeders
take on the armada.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.203
I gain access to the warship
and rescue the queen...

58:58.333 --> 59:00.862
...I mean, my mother.

59:01.702 --> 59:04.791
I'll alert you when I'm off the ship;
at which point, the battleship takes out Zhong.

59:04.958 --> 59:07.862
How do we close the slick before
it swallows the planet?

59:07.865 --> 59:10.455
Follow me here.
If what Chunk is working on manages

59:10.456 --> 59:11.656
to do what it is
supposed to do...

59:11.878 --> 59:12.923
Open a slick.

59:13.020 --> 59:14.520
Then theoretically...

59:15.084 --> 59:18.533
Theoretically it should be able
to close one.

59:18.635 --> 59:19.755
Theoretically.

59:20.135 --> 59:21.135
Not bad.

59:21.141 --> 59:27.022
<i>Not bad for insanity.</i>
My speeders take on Zhong's armada?

59:27.399 --> 59:29.601
The battleship
takes out the warship.

59:29.787 --> 59:33.471
In case you haven't noticed,
our ships are junk.

59:33.474 --> 59:37.634
We're outnumbered, outgunned.
It's impossible.

59:40.285 --> 59:43.288
You're the captain of the Royal Guard.
You're a hero.

59:43.516 --> 59:45.711
And you will lead your men
back through the wormhole,

59:45.713 --> 59:47.679
and together
we will defeat Zhong.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.458
Now, what would make
it possible?

59:50.838 --> 59:54.538
A backup battalion.
Reinforcements.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.638
Vix, make sure everything
keeps moving ahead.

59:58.640 --> 59:59.953
I'll be right back.

01:00:01.748 --> 01:00:05.118
(sighs)  He reminds me
of his father,

01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:08.728
he has the same fire
in his belly.

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.593
Same determination.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:13.709
Found it!

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:16.929
What did
he do now?

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.950
Stabilizer.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.283
Conductor.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.088
Sandwich.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:37.809
Sandwich?

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:41.436
(sighs)
I'm on a diet anyway.

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.113
Chunk, how we doin'?

01:00:47.225 --> 01:00:50.756
Just a few more things,
I'm almost--I'm almost  there.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.479
He's been going a while

01:00:53.823 --> 01:00:55.608
Shhh...   listen!

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:11.501
Run for your lives.
They're coming!

01:01:19.607 --> 01:01:20.607
Aaah!

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.391
Wait! Stand your ground.
Look!

01:01:43.404 --> 01:01:44.504
Aahh!

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.949
It's okay,
they're on our side

01:01:47.199 --> 01:01:48.399
But...  but how?

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:51.733
They're the same bugs as
from back home only mutated.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:53.026
They're hungry.
That's all.

01:01:53.051 --> 01:01:55.736
We promised them all the bananas
they could eat if they helped us.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.140
We?

01:01:58.507 --> 01:01:59.603
Genius.

01:01:59.728 --> 01:02:02.228
No, you're the genius.
What's happening with the--

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.013
Oh, right!
Kraken Slickinator standing by.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.689
The reverse slick window
should be attracted to whatever slick

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.428
Zhong is opening
on the other side.

01:02:09.488 --> 01:02:12.615
So...   we should end up
where we wanna be.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:15.226
Or, somewhere
entirely different.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.288
I'm hopung
for the first option.

01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:21.300
People of Bana:

01:02:22.474 --> 01:02:25.452
my friends and I have
crossed the universe only to find you.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.556
This was no accident.

01:02:27.724 --> 01:02:30.785
It was fate that brought us here,
to this place.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:33.881
You are the citizens
of a Bana that once was,

01:02:34.048 --> 01:02:35.861
a Bana that will be again.

01:02:35.863 --> 01:02:37.833
Zhong laid waste
to our planet,

01:02:38.023 --> 01:02:40.520
but together,
we're taking it back!

01:02:40.901 --> 01:02:42.995
(cheering)

01:02:43.505 --> 01:02:45.407
Can we go
to the bathroom first?

01:02:45.742 --> 01:02:46.742
Yes!

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.784
Everyone stand back!

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:53.061
And...
A now!

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.142
Dahhh, no!

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:06.074
Why won't you work?
Why?

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:10.203
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.880
Look at it!
It's working!

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.346
Oh yes!

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:27.346
Yes, that's it!

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.262
Come on,
pull together baby!

01:03:50.365 --> 01:03:52.267
Yeah!

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.207
You did it!

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.294
Oh and ah,  this...

01:04:04.776 --> 01:04:06.150
How did you--?

01:04:06.152 --> 01:04:08.002
He's the Chunkinator.
That's how!

01:04:08.113 --> 01:04:10.296
Outstanding, my boy.

01:04:10.304 --> 01:04:12.610
I always knew
you'd do great things.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.685
You know,
other than eating.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:23.603
Spark, there's something else.

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:26.651
I ah, I found someone
in the trash.

01:04:27.088 --> 01:04:29.187
She was in need
of a little T-L-C...

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.817
Tender Lovin' Chunk.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.883
Bananny!

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:50.595
It's so good
to see you, Spark!

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:52.766
It's okay.
Her voice is a little different,

01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:55.186
but otherwise,
she's the same old Bananny.

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:13.193
Oh, except she's weaponized.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:16.279
Let's kick some asteroid!

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:19.875
Cool!

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.035
Kraken in position.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:44.733
Universe...  be mine!

01:05:51.724 --> 01:05:54.132
Your Exquisite
Holy Moronicus, sir,

01:05:54.235 --> 01:05:56.663
the reverse end
of a second slick is opening

01:05:56.665 --> 01:05:59.701
and, ah,
something is coming through.

01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:03.669
What are you talking about?
What slick?

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:07.381
Did you make another slick?
Who made another slick?

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.752
Lookout!

01:06:42.157 --> 01:06:43.357
Uh-oh!

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.440
Okay, all clear!

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.749
Hey Zhong!
You miss me?

01:07:16.917 --> 01:07:20.667
You?
But...  you're dead!

01:07:20.746 --> 01:07:23.537
I saw you go
through the Kraken slick.

01:07:23.629 --> 01:07:26.209
I'm back and I've brought
some friends.

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.292
You remember
the captain and the Royal Guard?

01:07:35.858 --> 01:07:38.611
You sent them through the slick
along with my dad.

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:41.045
Your rule is over, Zhong!

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.860
What are those?

01:07:49.055 --> 01:07:51.038
Alright, you privates!

01:07:51.162 --> 01:07:53.669
We've been waiting
13 years for this.

01:07:53.752 --> 01:07:56.711
It's time Zhong found out
what happens

01:07:56.713 --> 01:07:59.251
when you mess with
the Royal Guard!

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:05.365
Let's light that gorilla ship up.
Fire!

01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:17.426
Attack!  Attack!

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.705
Attack!

01:08:20.318 --> 01:08:22.241
Firing forward blasters.

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:30.243
You get your sorry hide
onto that battleship and sabotage it!

01:08:30.245 --> 01:08:33.640
Do you understand?
You makeup-painted refrigerator!

01:08:33.908 --> 01:08:35.117
Go!

01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:38.907
Koko do everything.

01:08:47.578 --> 01:08:48.902
Here they come.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.790
Spark, I-I don't do well
under pressure.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:16.059
Aren't there are million more capable,
less afraid of laser fire, more adept at--

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.912
Chunk, you're the
only one who can do this.  Focus!

01:09:18.913 --> 01:09:21.194
Right.. right..  focus, right.

01:09:21.197 --> 01:09:23.546
Chunk!  (- What?)
You're the Chunkinator.

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:25.661
I'm Chunkinator.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:30.559
I'm the Chunkina--
Um, is that a problem?

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:36.928
She's headed to the battleship.
Vix, you gotta stop her.

01:09:37.045 --> 01:09:38.783
Chunk, close that slick.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:42.836
I'm off to save my mom.
See you on the other side.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.720
What did he
mean by that?

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:50.520
What?
The other side of what?

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:56.568
Okay...   ah... right.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:56.670
I think figuring out how to reverse
a polaron  charge can't be any harder than, ah...

01:10:56.837 --> 01:10:59.881
eating that space rat sundae
 last night.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:03.343
I'm the Chunkinator.
I'm the Chunkinator.  I'm--

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:04.550
Ahhhh!

01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:08.473
Okay, it's much harder.

01:11:25.449 --> 01:11:28.566
Spark!
I thought you were...

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.495
I had to come back
to save my mom.

01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:33.129
What?

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.595
How did you know?

01:11:35.663 --> 01:11:38.714
All these years,
why didn't you tell me?

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.914
I couldn't.
If Zhong knew about you,

01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:44.571
 he would have torn what little's left of
Bana apart to find you.

01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:46.547
And I had to at least
try and stop him

01:11:46.549 --> 01:11:48.737
from doing more harm
than he already had.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.953
But in the stories Bananny told me,

01:11:51.955 --> 01:11:54.506
why didn't she say
who my parents really were?

01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:57.536
Because I programmed her not to.

01:11:58.201 --> 01:11:59.986
For your own protection.

01:12:01.902 --> 01:12:03.926
Oh, Spark...

01:12:05.699 --> 01:12:07.244
the only thing
that's kept me going

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.903
is the hope
of being with you again.

01:12:11.203 --> 01:12:14.959
I love you, Spark.
More than anything.

01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:30.556
Well, look what we have here.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.258
- Oh no you don't!
- Huh?

01:12:55.734 --> 01:12:56.934
Aaaah!

01:12:57.901 --> 01:13:00.103
Raah!  Uuh.

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.350
Ahhh!

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.869
A mother-son reunion.
How sweet!

01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:36.705
So, let me get this straight:

01:13:36.872 --> 01:13:39.794
Your dumpster-diving child here,

01:13:39.899 --> 01:13:42.699
together with
a band of old has-beens...

01:13:42.794 --> 01:13:47.448
and some bugs,
take on my army.

01:13:47.448 --> 01:13:49.096
Was that the idea?

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:52.312
(laughs)

01:13:53.347 --> 01:13:55.891
How priceless!

01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:59.811
You can't make that stuff up,
you really can't.

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:05.484
Enjoy the front row seats
to your own failure.

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:08.781
Aaah-uuh.

01:14:13.898 --> 01:14:14.898
Raahh!

01:14:50.364 --> 01:14:52.993
Aaaawugh! Uh!

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.856
All systems,
damage report!

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.405
Engineering?

01:15:03.033 --> 01:15:04.033
Ted?

01:15:05.986 --> 01:15:06.986
Mmmh!

01:15:13.844 --> 01:15:18.015
The royal blunder ship
isn't looking so good now, is it?

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:24.730
You and your father are so
very much alike.

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:30.193
Both of you failed
so completely.

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:33.423
Speaking of my brother,

01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:36.661
why didn't he come through the slick
with the rest of you?

01:15:38.076 --> 01:15:43.582
Finally, someone has the decency
to stay dead.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:47.020
Are the photon cannons ready?

01:15:47.022 --> 01:15:50.006
Photon cannons ready
in T-minus 30.

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:54.134
Everybody get ready
for some fireworks!

01:15:59.765 --> 01:16:01.823
Don't worry, Mom.

01:16:13.914 --> 01:16:14.914
Mmmh.

01:16:18.499 --> 01:16:19.599
Huh?

01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:22.730
Muph!

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:26.667
Koko quit this
lousy job.

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:31.146
Fire photons!

01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:36.009
What's happened?
What's going on?

01:16:47.948 --> 01:16:48.948
Oops.

01:16:52.547 --> 01:16:54.323
Get him!

01:16:54.528 --> 01:16:56.649
Secure the milk and cookies.
Secure the milk and cookies.

01:16:57.114 --> 01:17:00.068
So the isolating starter
hit the pulsing harness causing the--

01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:01.619
Just give it here, man.

01:17:03.097 --> 01:17:04.097
Thu-aah!

01:17:04.121 --> 01:17:06.581
Royal Guard!

01:17:20.045 --> 01:17:22.150
I knew that would come in handy
for something.

01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:23.518
Amazing!

01:17:23.547 --> 01:17:25.372
- Who are you?
- George, sir.

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:27.561
Curious?
What is that?

01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:30.607
Zhong's warship.

01:17:30.609 --> 01:17:34.425
Get us alongside
and ready the starboard torpedo bay.

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:45.537
Did somebody order
 milk and cookies?

01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:01.739
Oh!  Ah!

01:18:04.268 --> 01:18:06.604
Ah!  To the escape pods!

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:12.250
Why don't we have
escape pods?

01:18:12.517 --> 01:18:14.971
You wanted
the master bathroom.

01:18:18.796 --> 01:18:20.439
Waaao!

01:18:39.766 --> 01:18:41.061
Chunk!

01:18:41.457 --> 01:18:42.457
Vix!

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:45.226
Floyd!

01:18:45.931 --> 01:18:48.446
- Hurry!
- Ah! Engaging.

01:18:53.605 --> 01:18:56.066
Oh why?
Why?!

01:18:56.233 --> 01:19:00.404
Use your head!   (- What?)
Your head, bang it with your head!

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:07.323
More, more!
Keep going!

01:19:09.792 --> 01:19:12.285
Oh, that's gonna hurt.

01:19:14.192 --> 01:19:16.121
Ha-ha-haa!

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:39.607
Stop!

01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:44.823
Please, you wouldn't  leave
your  <i>uncle</i>  behind?

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:48.535
Your very own
flesh and blood?

01:19:48.902 --> 01:19:50.410
For what you
did to my father,

01:19:51.044 --> 01:19:52.933
and what you did
to all of Bana,

01:19:53.438 --> 01:19:54.738
I should.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:58.128
But you won't,
will you?

01:19:58.492 --> 01:20:00.419
You'll live
the rest of your life in a cell.

01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:03.750
A very dark cell.

01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:06.219
That's perfect, thank you.

01:20:06.386 --> 01:20:10.682
I can do dark.
Reminds me of my heart.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:12.717
Can I come on board now?

01:20:26.156 --> 01:20:27.590
Are you hungry, Zhong?

01:20:27.812 --> 01:20:30.075
Actually yes.
Why?

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.414
Because you about to taste bitter defeat.
Fire torpedos!

01:20:57.979 --> 01:21:03.026
Well, look at us.
One big happy family.

01:21:03.193 --> 01:21:08.782
My...  looking particularly divine,
oh shining jewel of my heart.

01:21:08.949 --> 01:21:12.577
Let's put the past behind us.
Shall we?

01:21:12.744 --> 01:21:16.863
I'm ready to look to the future
with those I...

01:21:19.626 --> 01:21:21.503
Love....

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:22.971
How about a kiss?

01:21:23.359 --> 01:21:25.771
Alright, pucker up then.

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:31.722
Really...?    I've only
been waiting 13  years for this.

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:33.816
Close your eyes.

01:21:38.437 --> 01:21:41.606
And I've been waiting
13 years for that.

01:21:43.795 --> 01:21:49.855
Eyaaaah!

01:22:27.835 --> 01:22:32.009
Ahhh, look at him.
He's growing up so fast.

01:22:33.186 --> 01:22:36.661
Mmh, God, they really do have
good buffet food here.

01:22:36.828 --> 01:22:40.045
This reminds me of that time
you all saved the universe

01:22:40.047 --> 01:22:42.398
and Spark took his
rightful place on the throne

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.733
and you were
there and he was there.

01:22:45.141 --> 01:22:47.096
Bananny, that's right now.

01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:52.593
Wake up, old girl.

01:22:53.346 --> 01:22:55.600
Raaahahrrr!

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:07.901
Ready to meet
your adoring subjects?

01:23:08.089 --> 01:23:09.089
Are you kidding?

01:23:09.444 --> 01:23:11.503
I've been waiting
a thousand roach years for this.

01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:13.285
 Bring me my staff!

01:23:15.629 --> 01:23:18.253
Eh-eh,  I'm getting it.

01:23:18.478 --> 01:23:22.667
(sighs) Truth is, I don't know how
to be a prince.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.887
I don't feel like a prince.

01:23:25.757 --> 01:23:27.328
You are a prince.

01:23:29.089 --> 01:23:32.167
Your father would've been
proud of you, Spark.

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:35.967
I wish he
could've been here.

01:23:45.647 --> 01:23:47.096
He is.

01:23:50.527 --> 01:23:52.605
Okay,   I'm ready.

01:24:12.007 --> 01:24:14.593
But is the universe
ready for him?

01:24:28.648 --> 01:24:30.637
Loyal citizens!

01:24:31.514 --> 01:24:36.239
I give you Spark,
prince of Bana!

01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:42.420
Mom.

01:24:42.422 --> 01:24:43.422
Yes?

01:24:44.414 --> 01:24:45.809
It's good to be home.
