target...

00:21.700 --> 00:22.990
>> I don't know what to do.

00:22.990 --> 00:26.990

Jace was next on the chopping

00:26.990 --> 00:27.990
block.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.990
>> You know he'd come after our
group.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.700
>> Announcer: Audrey helped
seal his fate.

00:32.700 --> 00:39.990
>> We need to target someone who
would put your name out there.

00:39.990 --> 00:39.990
Jason.

00:39.990 --> 00:43.990
>> I have nominated you Jane,
and you Jackie.

00:43.990 --> 00:49.990
>> I have nominated you John and
you Jason.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.000
>> Announcer: Shelli told them
why.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.120
>> I have within told that you
would come after me, so I have

00:55.120 --> 00:55.990
put you up.

00:55.990 --> 00:59.000
>> Announcer: When Jason
confronted Shelli about her

00:59.000 --> 01:02.990
speech, she revealed that Audrey
was behind her nomination.

01:02.990 --> 01:03.990
>> I heard it from Audrey.

01:03.990 --> 01:07.990
>> If what Audrey is telling me
is not true, I don't know how

01:07.990 --> 01:10.700
much longer can I protect her in
this game.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.990

instincts telling her that Jason

01:13.990 --> 01:13.990
knew the truth.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.990
>> I'm up there because people
lied.

01:16.990 --> 01:24.990
>> Jason is trouble, not because
he's nominated, but because I

01:24.990 --> 01:28.990
believe he thinks I had
something to do with it, and I

01:28.990 --> 01:29.990
did.

01:29.990 --> 01:34.950
>> Announcer: Audrey tried to
backtrack.

01:34.950 --> 01:37.000
>> That's a lie and I'm not
going to let you make me believe

01:37.000 --> 01:37.990
it.

01:37.990 --> 01:40.000

contemplating a new target.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.990

to go home this week.

tactic battle of the block,

01:48.990 --> 01:50.990
James and Jackie evenfloed into
victory.

01:50.990 --> 01:55.990
>> You outshined your opponent
and won the battle of the block

01:55.990 --> 01:57.950
and are now safe of the week.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.990

of household and forced Jason,

02:00.990 --> 02:07.990
John and Liz to get in sync with
a week-long punishment.

02:07.990 --> 02:12.990
>> You're fort piercing a new
band called the backstreet boys.

02:14.990 --> 02:16.990

explosive fight leads to

02:16.990 --> 02:17.120
shocking consequences.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.990

going to feel stupid.

household again this week.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.000
But with being head of household
comes some responsibility.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.990
I put Jason up as my target this
week, but my mind is starting to

03:24.990 --> 03:28.000
change already.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.990
>> I need a good shower.

03:30.990 --> 03:33.990
I've just been dethroned as hoh.

03:33.990 --> 03:35.990
Shelli winning is not a bad
thing.

03:35.990 --> 03:38.540
I'm pretty sure she'll keep my
sitser and I safe for another

No back door.

We can rest easy.

03:52.950 --> 03:55.990

we just won the battle of the

03:55.990 --> 03:58.990
blocks, so right now they can't
do nothing to me.

03:58.990 --> 04:01.990
I'll just sit back, eat cereal
all week and watch all the

04:01.990 --> 04:01.990

04:01.990 --> 04:04.990
>> Make no mistake about it, we
earned that.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.990
We were down with our backs
against the wall.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.990
We came back and won.

04:08.990 --> 04:12.990
>> Just sit back and enjoy the
week now.

04:12.990 --> 04:17.990

04:17.990 --> 04:19.990

tomorrow.

04:19.990 --> 04:26.120
>> I know.

04:26.120 --> 04:30.990
>> So I'm officially a nominee,
and only veto can save me now.

04:30.990 --> 04:35.410
If I don't get myself off this
block, I'm going home broke, and

04:35.410 --> 04:41.990
back in the basement.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.990
>> Holler.

04:44.990 --> 04:45.990
Doing all right?

04:45.990 --> 04:47.990
>> I'm worried about you.

04:47.990 --> 04:49.990
>> Oh, thank you.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.990
I just lost the battle of the
block.

04:51.990 --> 04:55.990
I'm officially nominated and
I've been here before, but

04:55.990 --> 04:57.990
usually I'm trying to get to
this spot.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.990
When I wasn't trying to get
here, now it's just kind of

05:00.990 --> 05:01.990
lame.

05:01.990 --> 05:05.990
But I have a good streak with
the vetoes, fight, win, live.

05:05.990 --> 05:07.990
Let's do this.

05:07.990 --> 05:08.990
It will work out.

05:08.990 --> 05:30.990
I've been in this situation
before.

05:30.990 --> 05:43.000
>> What are you worried about?

06:03.990 --> 06:05.990
>> Why is Audrey telling me all
this information?

06:05.990 --> 06:06.990
I couldn't tell you.

06:06.990 --> 06:09.990
But it doesn't matter because
I'm going to tell Shelli and

06:09.990 --> 06:27.990
Clay, and we're going to sort
all this mess out.

06:27.990 --> 06:28.990
>> Audrey is talking to me.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.990
She's going to know.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.990
>> Go up there right now.

06:34.990 --> 06:39.990
>> Me presenting this
information with -- when my back

06:39.990 --> 06:41.990
isn't against the wall is
definitely a little game play

06:41.990 --> 06:45.990
for me, but it also shows Clay
and Shelli that I'm on their

06:45.990 --> 06:45.990
side.

06:45.990 --> 06:49.540
Now earlier in the day Audrey
was saying she's pissed at you

06:49.540 --> 06:51.990
for something about Jason.

06:51.990 --> 06:56.990
>> She's mad at me because I
told Jason the truth.

06:56.990 --> 07:00.990
>> You all don't owe her
anything, Audrey.

07:00.990 --> 07:01.990
You all saved her.

07:01.990 --> 07:04.990
I don't know if she's baiting
me, but she was talking

07:04.990 --> 07:06.990
negatively about you guys.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.990
And the conversation was jumping
all over the place, but it

07:09.990 --> 07:12.990
pretty much had to do with you
and Clay, more you, though.

07:12.990 --> 07:15.990
>> Targeting me?

07:15.990 --> 07:18.290
>> She didn't say she was
targeting you.

07:18.290 --> 07:23.990
She just was like, just separate
you all two.

07:23.990 --> 07:26.000
>> She's driving me seriously.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.990
This isn't a one-day thing.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.990
This has been occurring for
weeks.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.990
Audrey is digging her own grave.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.990
>> She makes me paranoid.

07:33.990 --> 07:34.120
I can't take that.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.700
>> She's worried.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.290
She's nervous.

07:36.290 --> 07:47.990
It's ruining your game.

07:50.990 --> 07:52.950
>> What's going on?

07:52.950 --> 08:00.830
Why are you being weird?

08:00.830 --> 08:03.990
>> I needed to talk to Jason.

08:03.990 --> 08:08.700
>> I've heard it from Audrey.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.990
>> Shelli would never
intentionally throw you under

08:10.990 --> 08:11.990
the bus.

08:11.990 --> 08:15.990
You know, that you should never
second guess her and never doubt

08:15.990 --> 08:16.990
that, ever.

08:16.990 --> 08:20.990
There's a lot of things that
caused us to fight with you.

08:20.990 --> 08:22.290
We've looked past that.

08:22.290 --> 08:25.990
>> You two have each other.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.990
>> You have me, Shelli, Vanessa.

08:27.990 --> 08:35.990
>> And then also like I saw you
once today.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.990
>> It's not even in the equation
right now.

08:38.990 --> 08:39.990
You're being paranoid.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.990
Shelli's in power.

08:41.990 --> 08:42.000
Jason's on the block.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I don't see how much better that
can get for you.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.990
>> So what happens if she wins
veto?

08:48.990 --> 08:49.990
>> We don't know.

08:49.990 --> 08:51.990
Right now not even a concern.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.990
You think too far ahead.

08:52.990 --> 08:57.990
>> You swear on your life she's
not going to put me up as a

08:57.990 --> 08:57.990
replacement?

08:57.990 --> 09:00.990
>> Audrey, if she...

09:00.990 --> 09:04.830
>> So I'm talking to Audrey, and
she's worried about being put up

09:04.830 --> 09:06.990
on the block as a replacement
nominee.

09:06.990 --> 09:08.990
Honestly, the truth is she
should be worried.

09:08.990 --> 09:13.950
I'm just trying to keep her calm
so she doesn't blow up our game.

09:13.950 --> 09:14.990
You're overreading every little
thing.

09:14.990 --> 09:15.990
>> I probably am.

09:15.990 --> 09:16.990
>> You are.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.990
You're safe yet another week.

09:18.990 --> 09:27.990
Go out and try to win hoh next
week.

09:27.990 --> 09:28.990
>> Okay.

09:28.990 --> 09:31.990
Oh, my God, Vanessa, we have so
much to talk about.

09:31.990 --> 09:34.120
Please tell me no one comes in
that door.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.990
Audrey is driving me crazy.

09:37.990 --> 09:41.290
I am totally owning up to this.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.000
I completely screwed up with my
conversation with Jason.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.990
I did not think about the
aftermath and what I wanted to

09:46.990 --> 09:52.990
say to Jay isn't afterwards, and
I word vomited.

09:52.990 --> 09:54.990
>> You said Audrey...?

09:54.990 --> 09:57.990
>> Shooting her name out felt
like a relief

09:57.990 --> 10:00.990
I'm tired of not saying anything
about her.

10:00.990 --> 10:03.290
Now she's even more pissed about
me.

10:03.290 --> 10:03.990
>> Okay.

10:03.990 --> 10:03.990
>> What?

10:03.990 --> 10:05.990
>> I just talked to her.

10:05.990 --> 10:10.120
She's crying because she feels
so guilty and she's so paranoid

10:10.120 --> 10:13.990
that it's going to get back to
you.

10:13.990 --> 10:15.990
And she feels... I get it.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.990
That's why she's so paranoid,
because she's done people so

10:19.990 --> 10:22.000
dirty in this game, how do you
not get paranoid?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.990
>> I know there's a possibility
that I may be faced with the

10:25.990 --> 10:28.990
extremely hard task of putting
Audrey up as a replacement

10:28.990 --> 10:28.990
nominee.

10:28.990 --> 10:32.830
On a personal level, I
absolutely love her and she's my

10:32.830 --> 10:36.990
friend for sure, but on a game
level, I just don't know that I

10:36.990 --> 10:38.830
can level with her at all.

10:38.830 --> 10:41.990
>> Oh, my gosh.

10:41.990 --> 10:44.990
>> Be tight with the people who
are freaking protecting you.

10:44.990 --> 10:45.990
She's pushing us away.

10:45.990 --> 10:50.410
>> Let me tell you, I will wipe
my hands clean and be fine about

10:50.410 --> 10:50.990
it.

10:50.990 --> 10:55.950
>> You can't hang out in this
room until pov players are

10:55.950 --> 10:55.990
picked.

10:55.990 --> 11:00.950
If she comes up to you, act
like, what's wrong.

11:00.950 --> 11:02.990
Once pov is picked, whoa, I have
some things I want to say to

11:02.990 --> 11:04.290
her.

11:14.990 --> 11:16.000

13:32.410 --> 13:35.990
competition, the head of
household, the two nominees and

13:35.990 --> 13:37.990
two other players selected by
random draw.

13:37.990 --> 13:41.000
Best-case scenario is that
Audrey doesn't get picked

13:41.000 --> 13:43.410
because she may be going up as a
replacement nominee.

13:43.410 --> 13:50.990
Will the two nominees please
join me up here.

13:50.990 --> 13:54.000
I as head of household and the
two nominees will each pull a

13:54.000 --> 13:57.990
chip out of the box to determine
the two other players competing

13:57.990 --> 13:59.990
in the veto competition.

13:59.990 --> 14:06.990
As hoh I will pick first.

14:06.990 --> 14:07.990
Vanessa.

14:07.990 --> 14:13.990
[Applause]
>> I want the play.

14:13.990 --> 14:17.990
I want to play.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.290
>> The first name I grab out of
this box, they are irrelevant.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.990
I want to win this thing.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.990
Meg.

14:25.990 --> 14:33.990
[Applause]
>> Houseguest choice.

14:33.990 --> 14:34.990
Oh, ah.

14:34.990 --> 14:39.290
I'm going to pick James.

14:39.290 --> 14:42.290
>> Definitely playing for Jason
in the veto competition because

14:42.290 --> 14:44.990
hopefully if I win, I can pull
him off the block and that means

14:44.990 --> 14:47.990
he will owe me one big favor in
this game.

14:47.990 --> 14:56.990
>> I also have to choose a host
for the veto competition, and I

14:56.990 --> 14:59.990
choose Stevie.

14:59.990 --> 15:02.990
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

15:02.990 --> 15:02.990
begin.

15:02.990 --> 15:06.000
>> After picking players, I am
actually feeling pretty good.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I think at least 50% of these
people would take me off.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.990
The other ones I might be able
to convince to take me off.

15:12.990 --> 15:17.990
So this is the best player pick
draw that I could have had.

15:17.990 --> 15:19.990
>> Good luck.

15:19.990 --> 15:23.700
>> I'm super pumped Audrey
didn't get picked, so we don't

15:23.700 --> 15:25.990
have to worry about that
situation at all.

15:25.990 --> 15:30.700
Now we have the option to change
the nominations or keep them the

15:30.700 --> 15:39.990
same.

15:39.990 --> 15:41.950
>> What's up, guys?

15:41.950 --> 15:44.990
I feel like I have no idea
what's going on.

15:44.990 --> 15:48.830
>> If Jason came off, who would
you put up?

15:48.830 --> 15:54.990
>> That's like the real
question.

15:54.990 --> 15:57.990
>> Can you put up Audrey?

15:57.990 --> 15:58.990
>> How are you feeling about it?

15:58.990 --> 16:01.830
>> Sick.

16:01.830 --> 16:07.410
She's so paranoid that it's
making me... it's clouding my

16:07.410 --> 16:07.990
whole persona.

16:07.990 --> 16:10.990
>> I guarantee you everybody
would say the same thing.

16:10.990 --> 16:12.990
It's unanimous down there.

16:12.990 --> 16:15.990
>> That's like mob mentality,
though.

16:15.990 --> 16:17.120
>> That's the thing.

16:17.120 --> 16:17.990
I'm the same way.

16:17.990 --> 16:22.000
That was my risk last week, my
thought process, but it's not

16:22.000 --> 16:23.120
like my mentality.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.990
She's been given second and
third chances now and it's

16:25.990 --> 16:26.410
continuing.

16:26.410 --> 16:30.990
Now it's honestly hurt me once,
shame on you, hurt me twice,

16:30.990 --> 16:35.000
shame on me, hurt me three
times... [bell rings]

16:35.000 --> 16:38.410
>> Come in, darling.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.990
Who rings the door belt?

16:40.990 --> 16:40.990
It's so polite.

16:40.990 --> 16:43.540
>> You have all the veto
nominees up here.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.990
>> I wonder why.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.990
>> That's what I came up here
for, too.

16:48.990 --> 16:51.990
One of us is obviously going to
win veto.

16:51.990 --> 16:55.990
What do we want to do with the
noms if one of us wins veto.

16:55.990 --> 16:59.410
>> It's almost like everyone has
to be on the same page.

16:59.410 --> 17:03.990
>> My question for you, is there
somebody else you would put up

17:03.990 --> 17:06.990
that you would feel better about
the situation, because I don't

17:06.990 --> 17:08.700
know if that would be true
either for you.

17:08.700 --> 17:12.000
>> From the very by againing of
this game, I set my loyalties

17:12.000 --> 17:12.990
with Audrey.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.990
This is someone that I have put
my emotions into and my heart

17:16.990 --> 17:19.990
into, and who has told me I will
never forget how you were there

17:19.990 --> 17:22.990
for me when the rest of the
house turned against me, so then

17:22.990 --> 17:25.990
for me to be the one to turn
around and put her on the block,

17:25.990 --> 17:26.990
that is just so hard.

17:26.990 --> 17:29.990
>> Shelli, whatever you decide,
we got you, girl.

17:29.990 --> 17:32.410
This is not a position I want to
be in.

17:32.410 --> 17:38.990
>> Gotcha, girl.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.990
>> What are Clay and Shelli
saying?

17:41.990 --> 17:44.990
>> They were pretty much like,
whoever wins, they don't have a

17:44.990 --> 17:47.990
plan yet, but they just said,
we're going to wait because we

17:47.990 --> 17:48.990
have a whole day for the veto.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.990
>> They didn't talk about
replacements or anything, right?

17:51.990 --> 17:55.990
>> No, no, not yet anyway.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.990
Why, you worried or something?

17:57.990 --> 17:58.990
>> Me, no.

17:58.990 --> 17:59.990
I don't think I need to be.

17:59.990 --> 18:03.540
>> Audrey, I don't know what
planet you're on, but you're

18:03.540 --> 18:05.700
telling me that you're not
worried this week.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.990
This is "Big Brother."

18:06.990 --> 18:08.990
You need to always be worried.

18:08.990 --> 18:10.000
Like are you going to try to
win?

18:10.000 --> 18:16.990
>> What, veto?

18:16.990 --> 18:16.990
>> Yeah.

18:16.990 --> 18:25.000
>> If Jason comes down, it's
most likely to be the one that

18:25.000 --> 18:32.990
goes.

18:32.990 --> 18:37.120
>> I could send Audrey home.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.990
The whole entire house wanted
her out and two weeks later I'm

18:40.990 --> 19:05.540
hoh again and it's exploding
right back in my face again.

19:05.540 --> 19:13.700
>> You have to help me through
this.

19:13.700 --> 19:19.990
I just want to make the right
choice.

19:19.990 --> 19:40.990
I don't want the regret it
later.

19:40.990 --> 19:50.990
>> Why can't she just... why
can't she just... I feel like

19:50.990 --> 19:54.290
I've really been there for
Audrey, and she's somebody that

19:54.290 --> 19:55.990
I admire as a person.

19:55.990 --> 20:00.990
I don't want to be the one to
send her out the door.

20:00.990 --> 20:03.990
And I'm faced really, really
hard core with that decision.

20:03.990 --> 20:09.990
I don't want to have to be the
one to do it.

20:09.990 --> 20:13.990
>> If you don't feel comfortable
putting her up, don't do it.

20:13.990 --> 20:17.990
If I win, I'll do it next week.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.990
For damn sure I'll do it next
week.

20:19.990 --> 20:21.990
No hesitation.

20:31.990 --> 20:32.990
Be a fly on the wall

20:32.990 --> 20:48.950
inside the Big Brother house

20:48.950 --> 20:53.120
>> hey, everyone, it's time for
the veto competition.

20:53.120 --> 20:58.990
Meet me in the backyard.

20:58.990 --> 21:01.990
Later.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.700
>> So it's bb side high.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.990
I see Kelly.

21:07.990 --> 21:09.990
I see Jessie.

21:09.990 --> 21:13.990
I see a bunch of screeches.

21:13.990 --> 21:15.540
Where's my Zach Morris at?

21:15.540 --> 21:17.990
>> Oh, man, I've watching Steve.

21:17.990 --> 21:21.990
He looks like the science geek,
and I am so tempted to shove him

21:21.990 --> 21:23.950
in one of those lockers right
now.

21:23.950 --> 21:28.990
>> Students, welcome to bb side
high.

21:28.990 --> 21:34.410
[Applause]
Time-out.

21:34.410 --> 21:39.990
In today's chemistry class,
these guys will be concocting

21:39.990 --> 21:42.990
unique smells while trying to
avoid the chances of the veto

21:42.990 --> 21:45.990
blowing up in their face.

21:45.990 --> 21:47.990
Time-in.

21:47.990 --> 21:50.120
In each round of this
competition, you'll be shown a

21:50.120 --> 21:53.410
video containing a sequence of
colored chemicals that match the

21:53.410 --> 21:54.990
test tubes on your desk.

21:54.990 --> 21:59.990
You will then take a pop quiz
and be instructed to pour a

21:59.990 --> 22:01.830
specific colored chemical into
you flask.

22:01.830 --> 22:05.990
So a pay attention, because if
you pour the correct chemical,

22:05.990 --> 22:08.990
you'll advance to the next
round, but if you pour the

22:08.990 --> 22:10.990
incorrect chemical, your
experiment will go horribly

22:10.990 --> 22:14.990
wrong, eliminating you from the
game.

22:14.990 --> 22:17.990
The last house guest remain
willing win the power of veto.

22:17.990 --> 22:21.990
Are you ready to play "saved by
the smell"?

22:21.990 --> 22:23.950
[Applause]
>> Let's do this.

22:23.950 --> 22:23.990
>> Yeah.

22:23.990 --> 22:26.540
>> I need to be at the head of
this class.

22:26.540 --> 22:29.990
I need to get that veto
necklace, because if this

22:29.990 --> 22:33.990
explosion happens to me, he's
getting expels and he knows too

22:33.990 --> 22:37.990
much about that.

22:37.990 --> 22:38.990
>> Round one.

22:38.990 --> 22:45.990
The first cent is booyeah Berry.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.990
Pour the third chemical shown.

22:47.990 --> 22:50.990
>> I'm on the block playing
another veto competition, trying

22:50.990 --> 22:52.990
to save myself.

22:52.990 --> 22:56.990
I have a really good short-term
memory, so I'll just keep

22:56.990 --> 22:57.120
repeating... okay.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.990
I have a really good short-term
memory, so I'll just keep

23:00.990 --> 23:03.990
repeating the colors in my head
over and over and over and over

23:03.990 --> 23:04.990
again.

23:04.990 --> 23:05.990
Red.

23:05.990 --> 23:06.290
Blue.

23:06.290 --> 23:15.990
>> Pour your colored chemical
into your flask.

23:15.990 --> 23:22.990
It's time to take a smell of
booyeah Berry and see if you're

23:22.990 --> 23:25.830
correct.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.990
The correct chemical was purple.

23:27.990 --> 23:28.290
Congratulations.

23:28.290 --> 23:29.990
You are all correct.

23:29.990 --> 23:31.990
>> Nobody gets eliminated.

23:31.990 --> 23:34.290
I'm like, we passed first grade.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.410
Good job, everyone.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.990
>> Wound two.

23:36.990 --> 23:44.540
The next scent is kill pill
pine.

23:44.540 --> 23:48.990
Pour the solid color chemical
that was not shown.

23:48.990 --> 23:51.830
>> I'm trying to remember the
colors.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.410
I'm going to remember the first
letter of each color some say it

23:54.410 --> 23:58.990
goes red, orange, blue, I'm
going to remember r-o-b.

23:58.990 --> 23:58.990
So easy.

23:58.990 --> 24:04.990
>> My strategy for remembering
the colors is to sing song, red,

24:04.990 --> 24:05.990
green, red green blue.

24:05.990 --> 24:12.830
I make little songs in my head.

24:12.830 --> 24:18.120
>> Pour your colored chemical
into your flask.

24:18.120 --> 24:24.830
It's time to take a smell and
see if you are correct.

24:24.830 --> 24:28.990
>> Teachers knew back in the day
not to trust me with any

24:28.990 --> 24:30.990
chemicals, especially mixing
them together, because I

24:30.990 --> 24:33.120
probably would have...

24:33.120 --> 24:39.540
[Explosion]
>> I screamed.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.990
Oh, my God.

24:40.990 --> 24:49.990
>> That was so loud.

24:49.990 --> 24:53.120
>> Sorry, James, but your
chances of winning the veto have

24:53.120 --> 24:55.990
gone up in smoke.

24:55.990 --> 24:59.990
John, Jason, Meg, Vanessa and
Shelli, you are all still in the

24:59.990 --> 24:59.990
game.

24:59.990 --> 25:02.120
It's time for round three.

25:02.120 --> 25:09.990
The next scent is banging kiwi.

25:09.990 --> 25:14.540
Pour the chemical immediately
after the blue chemical.

25:14.540 --> 25:15.990
>> I'm looking around.

25:15.990 --> 25:19.990
I see my green color, but I'm
going to have to throw this one,

25:19.990 --> 25:23.990
so I'm rally rooting for my girl
Vanessa to win, this because she

25:23.990 --> 25:27.000
can help me make decisions
without getting all the blood on

25:27.000 --> 25:28.990
my hands.

25:28.990 --> 25:41.990
>> It's time to take a smell and
see if you are correct.

25:41.990 --> 25:51.830
[Explosion]
>> Oh, my gosh, that sound.

25:51.830 --> 25:58.990
>> Smell you later, Shelli, you
have been eliminated.

25:58.990 --> 26:02.990
John, Jason, Meg and Vanessa,
you are all still in the game.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.990
Round four.

26:04.990 --> 26:09.990
The next scent is peach.

26:09.990 --> 26:13.990
Psych.

26:13.990 --> 26:18.990
Pour the first striped chemical
shown.

26:18.990 --> 26:21.990
>> Now that Shelli's out, I mead
to take this thing down.

26:21.990 --> 26:25.990
I need to keep the power of veto
in our alliance controlled.

26:25.990 --> 26:29.990
>> It is so important for me to
win this comp, because if not I

26:29.990 --> 26:31.540
could so go home.

26:31.540 --> 26:37.990
If I do not win, I am putting my
fate out there into the

26:37.990 --> 26:40.290
universe.

26:40.290 --> 26:41.990
Oh, man!

26:41.990 --> 26:49.120
>> Pour your colored chemical
into your flask.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.990
>> Oh, man.

26:51.990 --> 27:09.990
>> It's time to take a smell and
see if you are correct.

27:09.990 --> 27:15.290
>> Yeah.

27:15.290 --> 27:17.990
[Screaming]
>> Sorry, Meg, you couldn't

27:17.990 --> 27:19.950
sniff out a win, and you are
out.

27:19.950 --> 27:21.990
>> Oh, I am not hot right now.

27:21.990 --> 27:25.990
>> John, Jay isn't and Vanessa,
you are all still in the game.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.990
It's time for round five.

27:27.990 --> 27:34.990
The next scent is trippin' tea.

27:34.990 --> 27:40.990
Pour the middle chemical of the
sequence.

27:40.990 --> 27:41.990
>> Oh.

27:41.990 --> 27:42.830
Oh.

27:42.830 --> 27:49.990
>> Green, orange, red, purple,
yellow.

27:49.990 --> 27:50.540
G-o-r-p-y.

27:50.540 --> 27:51.990
I have this round in the bag.

27:51.990 --> 27:52.990
>> Look at me.

27:52.990 --> 27:54.410
I am flying through this comp.

27:54.410 --> 27:56.990
I thought I'd be a hot mess.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.990
I'm even surprising myself with
how good I am.

27:58.990 --> 28:04.990
>> Pour your colored chemical
into the flask.

28:04.990 --> 28:08.120
>> I really don't get the sense
there's someone smarter than me

28:08.120 --> 28:10.990
that could win these mental
competitions.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.990
>> If you can't get this right,
you shouldn't be taking

28:12.990 --> 28:21.990
chemistry.

28:23.990 --> 28:27.990
I'm sorry, John and Jason, you
have both been eliminated, which

28:27.990 --> 28:32.990
means congratulations, Vanessa,
you have won the golden power of

28:32.990 --> 28:32.990
veto.

28:32.990 --> 28:33.990
>> Good job, guys.

28:33.990 --> 28:35.990
>> Oh, my God.

28:35.990 --> 28:38.990
>> Not that much has happened
since the last time we spoke,

28:38.990 --> 28:39.990
except for I won this guy.

28:39.990 --> 28:41.990
I'm over the top happy.

28:41.990 --> 28:44.990
It means I now have the power to
make important decisions about

28:44.990 --> 28:45.990
who ends up on the block.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.950
This is good stuff.

28:47.950 --> 28:48.990
>> Yay, v.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.950
This is absolutely perfect.

28:51.950 --> 28:52.990
Vanessa has the power of veto.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.830
This is what we wanted to
happen.

28:54.830 --> 28:55.990
She has the power of veto.

28:55.990 --> 28:58.410
I have the head of household
power.

28:58.410 --> 29:02.990
Together we can make the best
decision about what we want to

29:02.990 --> 29:03.540
happen.

29:03.540 --> 29:07.950
>> Womp, womp.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.000
This was my one chance to save
myself.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.990
I need Vanessa to use this veto,
because if I am up there against

29:14.990 --> 29:18.410
Johnny mack, there is nothing I
can say to these people.

29:18.410 --> 29:20.410
I might as well pack my bags
today.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.700
>> Oh, God.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.120
Let's go, Jason.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.700

along.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.000

32:54.000 --> 32:54.990
No, I'm not.

32:54.990 --> 32:58.990
After our conversation, I've
completely dropped it.

32:58.990 --> 33:01.540
>> Audrey does her little Audrey
thing.

33:01.540 --> 33:06.410
She sits down and kind of works
her way into the conversation.

33:06.410 --> 33:11.700
>> When you don't trust people
that trust you, you almost drive

33:11.700 --> 33:14.990
them away because you work
yourself up so much and you're

33:14.990 --> 33:16.410
paranoid they don't trust you
back.

33:16.410 --> 33:19.290
>> I'm offended that you'd make
that statement because I know

33:19.290 --> 33:24.990
from the beginning how loyal
I've been to Shelli.

33:24.990 --> 33:31.990
>> Everything that Shelli has
done for you, I feel that trust

33:31.990 --> 33:34.700
hasn't been reciprocated on that
end.

33:34.700 --> 33:36.990
When you so much as question her
loyalty.

33:36.990 --> 33:38.990
>> You're making me feel like
I'm so ungrateful.

33:38.990 --> 33:42.120
>> I've seen what she's done for
you and I've seen what she does

33:42.120 --> 33:43.990
for you.

33:43.990 --> 33:45.990
You asked me if she's going to
back door you.

33:45.990 --> 33:46.990
>> New York I didn't.

33:46.990 --> 33:47.990
>> Yes, you did.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.990
You said, swear to me she's not
going to back door me.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.120
>> Those aren't my words.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.410
>> Those weren't my words.

33:54.410 --> 33:57.120
>> Quote on quote.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.990
>> You swear on your life she's
not going to put me up as a

34:00.990 --> 34:01.700
replacement?

34:01.700 --> 34:02.990
>> Audrey, if she...

34:02.990 --> 34:05.290
>> I don't believe I used those
words.

34:05.290 --> 34:07.990
>> I know for a fact you did.

34:07.990 --> 34:09.990
1,000% you did.

34:09.990 --> 34:09.990
Word for word.

34:09.990 --> 34:11.990
>> We can go back and forth.

34:11.990 --> 34:15.290
>> I know exactly what you said
because in my mind...

34:15.290 --> 34:16.990
>> I know how it happened.

34:16.990 --> 34:18.990
I don't have a selective memory.

34:18.990 --> 34:21.410
I remember everything so
vividly.

34:21.410 --> 34:23.990
>> Yeah, well, I do too.

34:23.990 --> 34:27.120
>> I can't do anything if you
perceived it a different way.

34:27.120 --> 34:32.990
Clay is going to push and push
and push his opinion on me

34:32.990 --> 34:38.950
because he has this a-type
personality and by a-type I mean

34:38.950 --> 34:39.990
he's just an ass.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.540
>> For you to say I never said
that, that makes me even more

34:43.540 --> 34:43.990
pissed off.

34:43.990 --> 34:45.990
I know what you said word for
word.

34:45.990 --> 34:48.990
>> Clay, I swear on my life.

34:48.990 --> 34:52.990
>> I would bet everything I have
on this game what you said.

34:52.990 --> 34:53.990
>> Okay.

34:53.990 --> 34:59.000
Well, same here.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.990
>> Gosh, that makes me mad.

35:00.990 --> 35:04.990
If there's one thing I cannot
tolerate it's people lying to

35:04.990 --> 35:04.990
me.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.990
When she can't even admit the
simple fact that she asked me to

35:07.990 --> 35:11.990
swear on my life that Shelli
would not back door her to, me

35:11.990 --> 35:16.990
that's like spitting in your
hand and slapping me across my

35:16.990 --> 35:16.990
face.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.990
>> I need to talk to you like
right now.

35:19.990 --> 35:23.990
I almost blew my stuff with
Audrey.

35:23.990 --> 35:27.990
>> Shall we lock the door?

35:27.990 --> 35:30.990
>> She just always comes back to
how she wants the play the

35:30.990 --> 35:30.990
victim.

35:30.990 --> 35:33.120
Remember when I came up and I
was so mad.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.990
>> She said promise me that
Shelli won't back door me.

35:36.990 --> 35:45.990
>> She said she never said that.

35:45.990 --> 35:47.990
>> I can talk to Shelli, please?

35:47.990 --> 35:49.700
>> I can talk to her.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.990
>> Actually, can you just
mediate this and listen to both

35:51.990 --> 35:52.990
of us.

35:52.990 --> 35:54.990
>> Are you guys having a fight?

35:54.990 --> 35:54.990
>> Yes.

35:54.990 --> 35:56.990
>> You can talk.

35:56.990 --> 35:58.990
>> It's getting crazy up there.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.990
>> Do you want her to leave or
can she stay?

36:01.990 --> 36:02.990
>> I don't care.

36:02.990 --> 36:03.990
That's fine.

36:03.990 --> 36:09.990
>> The conversation went from
you're paranoid all the time and

36:09.990 --> 36:13.990
I haven't gone out of my way for
either of your games or

36:13.990 --> 36:16.950
anything, and my feelings got
hurt.

36:16.950 --> 36:17.990
>> I came into power.

36:17.990 --> 36:18.990
>> Right.

36:18.990 --> 36:22.410
>> Vanessa came into power and I
came back into power.

36:22.410 --> 36:25.990
That's three weeks in a row you
could have been dancing through

36:25.990 --> 36:26.990
Broadway happy.

36:26.990 --> 36:27.990
But you haven't been happy.

36:27.990 --> 36:30.990
>> So what else have I done to
either of you?

36:30.990 --> 36:33.990
>> There's a lack of trust that
he's absolutely correct.

36:33.990 --> 36:38.990
You don't trust us when we have
given you every single reason in

36:38.990 --> 36:40.990
the world to feel protected by
us.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.990
>> People are not putting
themselves in my shoes.

36:43.990 --> 36:47.120
I've had my back against the
wall since the first week.

36:47.120 --> 36:53.990
>> In my heart it offends me
that you would say that none of

36:53.990 --> 36:56.990
us have put ourselves in your
shoes when that is exactly what

36:56.990 --> 36:59.950
I've done.

36:59.950 --> 37:01.990
>> I've said that I've
appreciated it.

37:01.990 --> 37:04.990
I've said it to you multiple
times.

37:04.990 --> 37:09.000
And you're trying to make me
feel like [Bleeped] about it.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.410
I think this stems from
something deeper with you.

37:11.410 --> 37:12.990
I think you're making this about
you.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.990
That's why you were cornering me
outside.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.990
>> I cornered you?

37:16.990 --> 37:17.990
>> Yes.

37:17.990 --> 37:20.990
You're upset about something I
think...

37:20.990 --> 37:29.120
>> Because you' re a blatant
liar.

37:29.120 --> 37:29.990
And we have proof.

37:29.990 --> 37:30.290
We have facts.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.990
>> I'm not telling you because
I'm not throwing other people

37:32.990 --> 37:33.990
under the bus.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.000
The fact that you still have
doubts.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.990
>> You're saying that I have
doubts.

37:36.990 --> 37:40.990
>> You wanted me to swear on my
life that she wants to back door

37:40.990 --> 37:41.410
you.

37:41.410 --> 37:43.990
>> Quit telling me how I feel
and how I think.

37:43.990 --> 37:47.990
>> But why did I second guess
you?

37:47.990 --> 37:49.990
>> Because of things you heard
from week one.

37:49.990 --> 37:51.990
>> From week one?

37:51.990 --> 37:55.990
>> From week all
the way up.

37:55.990 --> 37:56.990
>> Clearly.

37:56.990 --> 37:57.990
Clearly.

37:57.990 --> 37:58.990
Your word means nothing in this
game.

37:58.990 --> 38:02.990
>> You want me to sit here and
say I'm doing all this stuff,

38:02.990 --> 38:04.990
and I'm not going to do that.

38:04.990 --> 38:08.700
And when this is all over,
you're going to feel stupid.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.990
>> I will take that risk and I
will live with... I will sleep

38:11.990 --> 38:13.990
good at night knowing that I
took that risk.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.990
>> I know you will because that
speaks a lot about your

38:16.990 --> 38:18.990
character.

38:18.990 --> 38:21.990
>> Do you feel you can trust
Vanessa?

38:21.990 --> 38:25.990
Like are you... I'm just letting
you guys talk because we've been

38:25.990 --> 38:25.990
talking.

38:25.990 --> 38:28.990
If you guys have anything you
all want to discussion?

38:28.990 --> 38:31.990
>> You're an amazing
manipulator.

38:31.990 --> 38:33.990
You're amazingly... you give an
amazing argument.

38:33.990 --> 38:37.990
You set up the whole scene just
as if it wasn't a plan to get

38:37.990 --> 38:38.990
him out.

38:38.990 --> 38:41.990
And I'm not going to try the
argue with you about it.

38:41.990 --> 38:42.990
They obviously believe you.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.990
>> You want to go back to
Justin?

38:44.990 --> 38:47.990
Were you in the room ever when I
said repeatedly, I have no

38:47.990 --> 38:50.990
reason to put him up.

38:50.990 --> 38:52.990
I wanted James, I wanted James.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.990
>> And you and myself...

38:54.990 --> 38:56.990
>> Get it out in the open.

38:56.990 --> 38:58.990
If you have a reason, get it in
the open.

38:58.990 --> 39:00.990
Because before that happens, I
don't have a reason.

39:00.990 --> 39:01.990
That's not manipulative.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.990
I didn't force...

39:03.990 --> 39:07.540
>> And you and myself and Austin
were coming up with reasons.

39:07.540 --> 39:08.000
>> What?

39:08.000 --> 39:11.990
>> Straight up, if you think I'm
on your side or ever will be,

39:11.990 --> 39:12.990
what a mistake you've made.

39:12.990 --> 39:14.120
>> I swear on my life...

39:14.120 --> 39:16.990
>> Quit swearing on you life.

39:16.990 --> 39:18.990
Do you not value your own life?

39:31.830 --> 39:33.990
>> I don't even want to walk
past anyone.

39:33.990 --> 39:35.990
From a logical perspective, I
don't believe that there's

39:35.990 --> 39:39.120
anything that I can do.

39:39.120 --> 39:43.990
I don't feel like I'm playing a
good game.

39:43.990 --> 39:48.540
I'm disappointed in myself for
letting these emotions get the

39:48.540 --> 39:51.990
best of me right now.

39:51.990 --> 39:52.990
>> Okay, everybody.

39:52.990 --> 40:08.990
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.990
This is the veto meeting.

40:10.990 --> 40:14.830
As everyone can see, Audrey has
decided not the participate.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.990
But the meeting will continue as
planned.

40:17.990 --> 40:21.990
There's a void in the room where
Audrey should be, and knowing

40:21.990 --> 40:25.290
that there's someone who is so
emotionally distraught that they

40:25.290 --> 40:28.990
can't even come to the next room
for a meeting weighs heavily on

40:28.990 --> 40:29.990
all of us in that room.

40:29.990 --> 40:33.990
I want to give both nominees a
chance to tell me why you think

40:33.990 --> 40:36.700
I should use the veto to save
you.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.990
>> Okay.

40:38.990 --> 40:42.990
Everybody knows this game has
been my obsession and my passion

40:42.990 --> 40:48.990
my whole life, and to Vanessa, I
just ask you to not let my dream

40:48.990 --> 40:49.990
end yet.

40:49.990 --> 40:53.990
Thank you.

40:53.990 --> 40:57.990
>> My favorite kind of vetoes
are the kind that are used to

40:57.990 --> 40:59.990
save me.

40:59.990 --> 41:00.990
So please use it on me.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.990
That would be really cool.

41:03.990 --> 41:06.990
Thanks.

41:06.990 --> 41:26.990
>> I have decided to use the
power of veto on Jason.

41:26.990 --> 41:29.990
Shelli, since I have just vetoed
one of your nominations for

41:29.990 --> 41:33.990
eviction, you will have to name
a new houseguest as the

41:33.990 --> 41:37.990
replacement nominee.

41:37.990 --> 41:41.990
>> We are all here to play a
game, and first time around I

41:41.990 --> 41:44.990
didn't feel that this person had
a fair shot.

41:44.990 --> 41:48.990
I do feel that this person now
has had a fair shot in this

41:48.990 --> 41:48.990
game.

41:48.990 --> 41:54.990
With that said, I am naming
Audrey as my replacement

41:54.990 --> 42:00.990
nominee.

42:00.990 --> 42:06.990
>> This veto meeting is
adjourned.

42:06.990 --> 42:10.990
>> Now that Audrey has been put
up on the block, my best move is

42:10.990 --> 42:11.990
to literally do nothing.

42:11.990 --> 42:14.990
At this point the game is a side
project right now.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.830
I'm just focused on the band.

42:16.830 --> 42:21.000
I got to make my chin strap game
strong and just make sure that

42:21.000 --> 42:22.990
everything pulls through with us
three.

42:22.990 --> 42:24.990
>> Audrey's finally on the
block.

42:24.990 --> 42:27.990
It is about damn time.

42:27.990 --> 42:32.700
But now I sort of feel bad for
her because clearly she's not

42:32.700 --> 42:34.120
taking it well.

42:34.120 --> 42:37.830
>> I'm teenage as good as I can
feel right now.

42:37.830 --> 42:37.990
Audrey's on the block.

42:37.990 --> 42:38.990
That's a great feeling.

42:38.990 --> 42:42.990
However, she has managed to slip
by these past three weeks.

42:42.990 --> 42:43.990
You never know with Audrey.

42:43.990 --> 42:45.990
She will do whatever is
necessary to stay in this game,

42:45.990 --> 42:48.990
and that's a little scary.

42:48.990 --> 42:51.990
>> Who will be evicted from the
"Big Brother" house?

42:51.990 --> 42:52.990
Audrey or John?

42:52.990 --> 42:57.990
And the power is up for grabs in
an all-new battle for head of

42:57.990 --> 42:57.990
household.

42:57.990 --> 43:02.990
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:02.990 --> 43:05.990
brother."
