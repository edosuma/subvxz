00:01.490 --> 00:07.040
last episode of ink master shopping

00:04.700 --> 00:08.090
there's a six minutes in this house

00:07.040 --> 00:11.750
that's scary

00:08.090 --> 00:14.160
a legendary veteran returned mr. Tommy

00:11.750 --> 00:17.160
helm

00:14.160 --> 00:18.930
and the Alliance felt the pressure I

00:17.160 --> 00:20.460
don't know what you're doing but it's

00:18.930 --> 00:23.880
not good I feel like everything I'm

00:20.460 --> 00:26.939
saying like shooting me down I just done

00:23.880 --> 00:29.520
with it in the Elimination tattoo the

00:26.939 --> 00:31.140
veterans had the upper hand the shooting

00:29.520 --> 00:33.449
for allegory unkindness

00:31.140 --> 00:35.070
artistic skin black Cobra you're doing

00:33.449 --> 00:39.150
it right they need to go home

00:35.070 --> 00:41.790
but tattoos it's just so hard to tattoo

00:39.150 --> 00:43.710
an area it doesn't have any elasticity

00:41.790 --> 00:45.239
the cool kids club scrambling and

00:43.710 --> 00:47.010
struggling for their lives and we're

00:45.239 --> 00:48.840
sitting here on Easy Street allegory

00:47.010 --> 00:50.370
completely dropped the ball but who's

00:48.840 --> 00:51.809
gonna step up and say that because you

00:50.370 --> 00:53.010
guys are so worried about being nice and

00:51.809 --> 00:54.690
being friends with people you're not

00:53.010 --> 00:56.610
worried about winning that's completely

00:54.690 --> 00:58.170
not true we can all sit around and sing

00:56.610 --> 01:03.000
Kumbaya or we can all compete for

00:58.170 --> 01:06.780
$100,000 each in the Elimination Empire

01:03.000 --> 01:09.210
States to do allegory arts and pins and

01:06.780 --> 01:12.270
needles were the bottom three shops

01:09.210 --> 01:14.580
Empire states to do this is a proportion

01:12.270 --> 01:17.280
day that back leg is locked out of

01:14.580 --> 01:18.840
proportion allegory arts I can't believe

01:17.280 --> 01:20.880
you tattooed it the way you tattooed it

01:18.840 --> 01:23.670
there is in a well pulled line in the

01:20.880 --> 01:26.310
pack pins and needles unfortunately it

01:23.670 --> 01:28.679
seems completely crazy the back leg is

01:26.310 --> 01:31.619
just one with one thickness all the way

01:28.679 --> 01:34.940
up pins and needles you do not have what

01:31.619 --> 01:34.940
it takes three masters shop

01:39.530 --> 01:46.900
eight shops remain to take on returning

01:42.760 --> 01:48.980
veterans job but only one will earn a

01:46.900 --> 01:52.960
$200,000 prize

guys

03:56.870 --> 04:01.250
I'm known for black and gray and

03:58.850 --> 04:03.230
portraits but I like to call myself a

04:01.250 --> 04:05.540
jack-of-all-trades and one of my models

04:03.230 --> 04:07.700
is you pick it I'll stick it so I like

04:05.540 --> 04:09.800
to do everything when I see a bad tattoo

04:07.700 --> 04:12.650
I get very pissed I'm gonna tear some of

04:09.800 --> 04:14.780
these guys a new one this is the last

04:12.650 --> 04:18.350
week a new shop will enter the

04:14.780 --> 04:19.820
competition I'm so stoked this is a last

04:18.350 --> 04:21.769
shop coming in we just gotta eliminate

04:19.820 --> 04:24.170
everybody that's already here you've

04:21.769 --> 04:28.850
reached a milestone but remember only

04:24.170 --> 04:30.800
one shop will earn $200,000 a feature in

04:28.850 --> 04:31.490

04:34.580 --> 04:41.060
master shop right now it's time to meet

04:37.820 --> 04:43.400
the last returning veterans they both

04:41.060 --> 04:47.830
competed on season five and one of them

04:43.400 --> 04:50.360
also competed on season seven yo

04:47.830 --> 04:52.810
representing golden skull tattoo in Las

04:50.360 --> 05:00.310
Vegas Nevada

04:52.810 --> 05:02.500
cleen Rock one and Aaron is I met this

05:00.310 --> 05:04.720
joker on season five and ever since

05:02.500 --> 05:06.520
we've been broski's we both already know

05:04.720 --> 05:08.080
what our strengths and weaknesses are

05:06.520 --> 05:09.430
because we were trying to utilize them

05:08.080 --> 05:11.560
against each other last night because I

05:09.430 --> 05:13.000
said be the portrait king over here you

05:11.560 --> 05:14.889
do clearly you're the portrait

05:13.000 --> 05:16.660
I'll put money on it the precision is

05:14.889 --> 05:19.210
not there then that mouth

05:16.660 --> 05:22.300
those lips are not her lips it changes

05:19.210 --> 05:23.710
that see ground air what's it feel like

05:22.300 --> 05:25.390
to be eliminated cuz I've never been

05:23.710 --> 05:27.190
there the veteran about to walk through

05:25.390 --> 05:30.600
the door is one of the most versatile

05:27.190 --> 05:33.430
artists ever to compete cleen Rock one

05:30.600 --> 05:35.710
you kind of lose that genuine look at

05:33.430 --> 05:37.840
this smile the shape of the mouth itself

05:35.710 --> 05:40.360
Reagan has a bump on the bottom right

05:37.840 --> 05:42.070
side that really comes up and you do it

05:40.360 --> 05:44.200
pretty straight clean gets a pass a lot

05:42.070 --> 05:45.490
of times what's up Kristen hey you know

05:44.200 --> 05:47.350
what you guys all got something to say

05:45.490 --> 05:49.600
at least I got the balls to say there

05:47.350 --> 05:51.160
are times a charm clean I got a score to

05:49.600 --> 05:53.020
settle with the old knucklehead there's

05:51.160 --> 05:54.370
not one person I want to compete against

05:53.020 --> 05:55.900
more than this guy let him know to keep

05:54.370 --> 05:58.419
his bags packed cuz he's not gonna stay

05:55.900 --> 06:01.270
very low yeah this week is designed to

05:58.419 --> 06:04.090
put your shop to the test succeed in you

06:01.270 --> 06:07.120
stay but fail and your shop will go home

06:04.090 --> 06:10.360
just as quickly as you returned this

06:07.120 --> 06:13.150
week we're testing precision precision

06:10.360 --> 06:14.950
is being very very accurate with every

06:13.150 --> 06:16.479
single line in every single little

06:14.950 --> 06:18.430
detail that you put into your piece of

06:16.479 --> 06:20.320
art this whole time I've been practicing

06:18.430 --> 06:22.150
everything that's my weakness I'm coming

06:20.320 --> 06:24.310
in hot on this one for this flash

06:22.150 --> 06:26.169
challenge you need a steady hand because

06:24.310 --> 06:29.470
instead of using tattoo machines to

06:26.169 --> 06:31.270
puncture skin you must use a drill to

06:29.470 --> 06:34.060
puncture wood

06:31.270 --> 06:36.100
using different sized drill bits your

06:34.060 --> 06:38.440
design will be determined by the size of

06:36.100 --> 06:40.840
the holes you drill and the distance

06:38.440 --> 06:43.120
between them I have used a power drill

06:40.840 --> 06:45.160
to hang up art on wall but I have never

06:43.120 --> 06:48.100
made art with it this is just gonna be a

06:45.160 --> 06:49.720
nice big win and your shop will have the

06:48.100 --> 06:53.830
power to assign all the human canvases

06:49.720 --> 06:59.040
for the elimination tattoo you have five

06:53.830 --> 06:59.040
hours and your time begins now

07:01.600 --> 07:05.660
today these artists are going to drill

07:03.680 --> 07:07.880
into a board and use a light behind it

07:05.660 --> 07:09.770
to create a pattern then down a crack

07:07.880 --> 07:11.330
and that's gonna be insane precision in

07:09.770 --> 07:13.760
this challenge is gonna be everything in

07:11.330 --> 07:15.560
order to create holes to create depth

07:13.760 --> 07:17.720
and dimension in the piece so for bright

07:15.560 --> 07:19.610
whites big holes close together for the

07:17.720 --> 07:21.020
bright whites also precision will be

07:19.610 --> 07:23.360
necessary to keep the piece looking

07:21.020 --> 07:26.060
aligned and tight it's going to be the

07:23.360 --> 07:27.180
candle I'm drilling though it's I need

07:26.060 --> 07:28.949
to start drawing lines

07:27.180 --> 07:31.540
[Music]

07:28.949 --> 07:33.550
I'm like a dude dude I'm not afraid of

07:31.540 --> 07:36.010
any power tools I can old garage full of

07:33.550 --> 07:38.530
the damn things we decide to cut out

07:36.010 --> 07:40.780
huge portions of the board's nobody else

07:38.530 --> 07:42.130
is gonna do it because it's so risky all

07:40.780 --> 07:44.500
the solid whites are gonna come through

07:42.130 --> 07:46.389
like Jesus and clouds baby we need to

07:44.500 --> 07:48.130
get this first skull pick and let

07:46.389 --> 07:50.830
everybody in the house know that we're

07:48.130 --> 07:53.120
here and we mean business awesome so far

07:50.830 --> 07:55.599
so good

07:53.120 --> 07:57.009
[Music]

07:55.599 --> 07:59.499
think about what you're doing before you

07:57.009 --> 08:02.080
doing everybody's gonna try and do some

07:59.499 --> 08:03.610
crazy big piece to show off and all you

08:02.080 --> 08:05.800
got to do is go simple we go right back

08:03.610 --> 08:06.909
to basics geometric shapes how many

08:05.800 --> 08:08.979
painters you're painting are still life

08:06.909 --> 08:10.240
this skull pick is vital man we got

08:08.979 --> 08:11.559
people on our side down we're all

08:10.240 --> 08:13.300
gunning for that Alliance on the other

08:11.559 --> 08:15.360
side of the room it's time to send them

08:13.300 --> 08:15.360
home

08:15.980 --> 08:19.930
[Music]

08:17.800 --> 08:22.990
we really need to be squatty ER and see

08:19.930 --> 08:26.740
more of it up here no this would be in

08:22.990 --> 08:28.479
front of it I just don't you all so no

08:26.740 --> 08:30.669
conversation at all I mean I'm telling

08:28.479 --> 08:32.289
the handle does not literally look like

08:30.669 --> 08:34.299
this you're doing it wrong that's all

08:32.289 --> 08:37.360
I'm telling you yes and I have a very

08:34.299 --> 08:41.708
balancing dynamic babes dead no I'm not

08:37.360 --> 08:45.190
but when he is done listening he is done

08:41.708 --> 08:46.810
listening you're just like you know what

08:45.190 --> 08:48.240
you're doing obviously because you won't

08:46.810 --> 08:51.130
listen to anything that I say

08:48.240 --> 08:53.589
if we can't smooth this out there's no

08:51.130 --> 08:55.360
reason to even continue because nothing

08:53.589 --> 08:57.279
good comes out of that I don't know how

08:55.360 --> 08:59.350
to continue right now can do what you

08:57.279 --> 09:02.680
were gonna do and we'll take the hit for

08:59.350 --> 09:03.150
it two more hours to go guys two more

09:02.680 --> 09:07.510
hours

09:03.150 --> 09:10.070
[Music]

09:07.510 --> 09:12.380
it's all gonna go very fast in here I'm

09:10.070 --> 09:14.360
actually created a special tool to be

09:12.380 --> 09:19.340
able to make perfect circles on our

09:14.360 --> 09:21.230
canvas looks really cool that's gonna be

09:19.340 --> 09:27.350
doing a lot of work today does it look

09:21.230 --> 09:30.080
like I do woodworking back home no katie

09:27.350 --> 09:33.080
is just sitting around not drilling

09:30.080 --> 09:35.270
holes not drawing holes not measuring

09:33.080 --> 09:37.580
anything now introducing Katie

09:35.270 --> 09:39.410
professional wifey girl why you didn't

09:37.580 --> 09:40.850
finish the wing oh that was I thought

09:39.410 --> 09:42.170
that was like an erase one Erin and I

09:40.850 --> 09:44.420
are still struggling with some

09:42.170 --> 09:45.980
communication issues so I just don't

09:44.420 --> 09:47.600
want to look at polka dots which is what

09:45.980 --> 09:49.670
it did look like the first time can we

09:47.600 --> 09:50.780
just skip flesh challenges I like the

09:49.670 --> 09:53.240
second one I don't know why you got rid

09:50.780 --> 09:56.710
of it all right it's hard to keep

09:53.240 --> 09:56.710
bringing the same fight every week

09:59.000 --> 10:08.640
five four three two

10:03.670 --> 10:08.640
fit machines down no more drillers I

10:08.760 --> 10:13.000
think the judges are gonna love this

10:11.080 --> 10:15.850
design classic trilogy just some

10:13.000 --> 10:17.410
straight-up art class boring and I don't

10:15.850 --> 10:20.170
give it about this pattern if black

10:17.410 --> 10:24.760
Cobras got like come on we got this in

10:20.170 --> 10:26.770
the bag all right guys it is time to

10:24.760 --> 10:29.110
critique your work and basilica tattoo

10:26.770 --> 10:31.210
let's start with you I do like the

10:29.110 --> 10:33.610
cleanliness of the design your ladybugs

10:31.210 --> 10:35.380
are smaller more detailed you use

10:33.610 --> 10:37.600
different size of drill bits to create

10:35.380 --> 10:38.470
shading you definitely created depth I

10:37.600 --> 10:42.310
think it's cool

10:38.470 --> 10:43.810
thank you Empire speed studio this could

10:42.310 --> 10:45.730
have been a train wreck I think you guys

10:43.810 --> 10:47.440
did a good job if this thing were to go

10:45.730 --> 10:48.940
awry you would see it in a second so I

10:47.440 --> 10:52.120
think you guys showed off strong

10:48.940 --> 10:54.160
precision in this piece artistic skin

10:52.120 --> 10:56.590
design it's appealing to the eye when

10:54.160 --> 10:58.000
you look at it as far as precision some

10:56.590 --> 10:59.500
of those tentacles are a little bit

10:58.000 --> 11:00.520
crooked you want to make sure when

10:59.500 --> 11:03.490
you're sitting there with that drill

11:00.520 --> 11:04.900
you're hitting every hold classic

11:03.490 --> 11:06.610
trilogy tattoo we wanted to make

11:04.900 --> 11:08.950
something real simple but still show

11:06.610 --> 11:10.930
precise light directions and shapes damn

11:08.950 --> 11:12.700
homie that is sick I like the way you

11:10.930 --> 11:14.860
did the little burst up there we get

11:12.700 --> 11:16.810
that idea of a light source for as

11:14.860 --> 11:18.370
simple as it can be this is where it all

11:16.810 --> 11:19.660
starts these are the shapes it's a

11:18.370 --> 11:20.050
pleasure to look at and I'm happy for

11:19.660 --> 11:22.360
you

11:20.050 --> 11:24.220
thank you very much they like it finally

11:22.360 --> 11:25.720
I think a lot of people have written us

11:24.220 --> 11:29.050
off but we're not out of this game yet

11:25.720 --> 11:31.450
black Cobra tattoos you've created quite

11:29.050 --> 11:33.370
an optical illusion it actually does

11:31.450 --> 11:35.050
play with your eyes which is pretty

11:33.370 --> 11:37.180
incredible considering it's a piece of

11:35.050 --> 11:39.160
wood with a drill you shall ultimate

11:37.180 --> 11:39.820
precision great job we didn't come here

11:39.160 --> 11:42.190
to mess around

11:39.820 --> 11:45.670
yeah we're in it to win it they did

11:42.190 --> 11:48.400
circles good job guys

11:45.670 --> 11:50.650
unkindness art I like the top half of

11:48.400 --> 11:53.230
this a lot more than the lower half the

11:50.650 --> 11:55.080
head the shoulders is so precise but

11:53.230 --> 11:59.200
then as you go down it's kind of like

11:55.080 --> 12:00.760
wah-wah-wah allegory arts your design is

11:59.200 --> 12:02.680
pretty loose your chain gets a little

12:00.760 --> 12:04.870
out of shape and in the spiderweb as

12:02.680 --> 12:06.340
well for some discrepancies I just don't

12:04.870 --> 12:09.460
know if it's gonna compete with the rest

12:06.340 --> 12:11.260
of the field old Tony I'm not blown away

12:09.460 --> 12:13.270
by the design I wish it was a little

12:11.260 --> 12:14.770
more interesting but the bottom circle

12:13.270 --> 12:16.390
that everything's radiating from is a

12:14.770 --> 12:19.840
very nice touch you guys really show a

12:16.390 --> 12:21.040
lot of precision in that area golden

12:19.840 --> 12:22.750
skull tattoo

12:21.040 --> 12:24.430
there's definitely contrast in it

12:22.750 --> 12:26.590
there's some things in there that could

12:24.430 --> 12:28.570
have been a little more precise but you

12:26.590 --> 12:30.820
attempted a difficult piece pretty cool

12:28.570 --> 12:32.740
I didn't come back to pussyfoot around

12:30.820 --> 12:34.750
everything I'm gonna go balls to the

12:32.740 --> 12:36.930
wall on every single flash challenge I

12:34.750 --> 12:36.930
got

12:38.480 --> 12:43.200
first ganz is lightened up like a damn

12:40.670 --> 12:44.910
Christmas tree

12:43.200 --> 12:46.020
I just really need you to relax your

12:44.910 --> 12:49.279
shoulders

12:46.020 --> 12:49.279
we might not finish at all

12:52.610 --> 12:57.350
hi guys today we're testing precision

12:54.649 --> 12:59.269
golden scholars here Aaron is and cleen

12:57.350 --> 13:01.490
Rock one I did like that they were able

12:59.269 --> 13:03.440
to pull out massive sections to create

13:01.490 --> 13:05.149
different values nobody else did that

13:03.440 --> 13:07.070
I'm not really super impressed by the

13:05.149 --> 13:08.779
candle in comparison to the rest of our

13:07.070 --> 13:10.760
field our fields really come on and

13:08.779 --> 13:12.829
actually excels in these challenges the

13:10.760 --> 13:14.600
competition was just crazy today that's

13:12.829 --> 13:17.000
not love Basilica tattoo who did the

13:14.600 --> 13:18.860
ladybugs I was pretty amazed by it

13:17.000 --> 13:20.839
there was precision in it the artwork

13:18.860 --> 13:22.910
was done well it looked like they really

13:20.839 --> 13:25.670
thought it out I was super impressed

13:22.910 --> 13:27.769
with their precision skills until I saw

13:25.670 --> 13:29.930
black cobras pieces they drew my eye

13:27.769 --> 13:31.399
into this vortex and was beautiful and

13:29.930 --> 13:33.140
in order for that to happen everything

13:31.399 --> 13:35.209
has to be perfect I don't know if I

13:33.140 --> 13:38.610
could have done better myself we let him

13:35.209 --> 13:41.800
know yeah let's do it right let's do it

13:38.610 --> 13:44.949
hi guys today you had to create an image

13:41.800 --> 13:47.410
that shows precision the judges have

13:44.949 --> 13:50.160
decided the winner of today's Flash

13:47.410 --> 13:50.160
challenge is

13:50.490 --> 13:58.110
black Cobra tattoos really nice

13:55.830 --> 14:00.420
concentric circles and it had a visual

13:58.110 --> 14:01.140
effect that was hard to achieve good job

14:00.420 --> 14:03.300
guys

14:01.140 --> 14:05.670
this is the best day ever to flash

14:03.300 --> 14:07.260
challenges in a row seriously you guys

14:14.430 --> 14:19.860

14:16.520 --> 14:20.310
again this close at least they're on our

14:19.860 --> 14:21.750
side

14:20.310 --> 14:24.120
so hopefully that plays into our hands

14:21.750 --> 14:24.740
in this next challenge you can all head

14:24.120 --> 14:31.970
back to the loft

14:24.740 --> 14:31.970
[Music]

14:35.490 --> 14:41.160
there is a clique here clearly all the

14:38.940 --> 14:42.899
cool kids help each other

14:41.160 --> 14:45.510
am i at a birthday party or am i

14:42.899 --> 14:47.160
competing for $200,000 but here's the

14:45.510 --> 14:49.410
thing you guys won the last challenge

14:47.160 --> 14:51.420
right now we're the ones that are on the

14:49.410 --> 14:53.399
roll right so I think we need to come up

14:51.420 --> 14:55.050
with a cohesive way absurd we're in

14:53.399 --> 14:56.820
control of this place yeah we started

14:55.050 --> 14:58.920
squashing their alliance as it is yeah

14:56.820 --> 15:01.020
so we fight harder in the jury appears

14:58.920 --> 15:03.450
we direct the worst skull picks to those

15:01.020 --> 15:05.580
guys we all work together do whatever we

15:03.450 --> 15:08.310
can right break that up incentive home

15:05.580 --> 15:11.300
yeah because I do not want to see that

15:08.310 --> 15:11.300
be the final three

15:23.230 --> 15:28.270
welcome to your next elimination tattoo

15:25.420 --> 15:30.160
the tiniest mistake could cost you shop

15:28.270 --> 15:34.480
two hundred thousand dollars in the

15:30.160 --> 15:36.700
first-ever title of master shop clean

15:34.480 --> 15:38.620
and Erin as the veteran artists it's on

15:36.700 --> 15:41.140
your shop to prove that you deserve to

15:38.620 --> 15:43.600
be here by overcoming your weaknesses

15:41.140 --> 15:47.950
and in their honor you will all be

15:43.600 --> 15:49.380
judged on precision and I'll bet you can

15:47.950 --> 15:52.420
see where this is going

15:49.380 --> 15:56.350
just say it there's no better test of

15:52.420 --> 15:57.820
precision than a portrait I don't

15:56.350 --> 15:59.500
specialize in portraits but I've done

15:57.820 --> 16:01.210
quite a few since season seven the

15:59.500 --> 16:03.880
pressures on you because if you send us

16:01.210 --> 16:05.740
home I'm gonna be pissed a job a first

16:03.880 --> 16:07.420
day on the job a facial feature even a

16:05.740 --> 16:09.430
millimeter off could change the

16:07.420 --> 16:11.380
appearance of your portrait entirely for

16:09.430 --> 16:14.830
this elimination tattoo you and your

16:11.380 --> 16:18.940
teammate must tattoo matching portraits

16:14.830 --> 16:21.880
on different canvases that's crazy

16:18.940 --> 16:23.830
two days before we came here dome laid

16:21.880 --> 16:26.470
me on on a little secret which was he's

16:23.830 --> 16:28.930
never done a portrait before this might

16:26.470 --> 16:30.880
be the day we go home every portrait is

16:28.930 --> 16:32.860
difficult in its own way everybody

16:30.880 --> 16:34.720
skin's different being that you have to

16:32.860 --> 16:37.210
do the same portrait on two different

16:34.720 --> 16:39.850
people that's super hard the key with

16:37.210 --> 16:41.290
this I think is communication get a game

16:39.850 --> 16:42.880
plan in your mind what are you gonna do

16:41.290 --> 16:44.470
how you're gonna do it you guys got your

16:42.880 --> 16:47.700
work cut out for you

16:44.470 --> 16:47.700

16:51.720 --> 16:57.009
black Cobra tattoos your shop won the

16:54.550 --> 17:00.339
flash challenge that means that you have

16:57.009 --> 17:03.189
the power to assign the canvases be

17:00.339 --> 17:04.720
precise your future depends on it man I

17:03.189 --> 17:07.299
came into this competition

17:04.720 --> 17:09.459
not wanting to form an alliance with any

17:07.299 --> 17:11.409
other team but if there are other teams

17:09.459 --> 17:13.209
here playing a strength and numbers game

17:11.409 --> 17:15.549
then we're gonna have to fight back

17:13.209 --> 17:17.409
she's crush thank you where you don't

17:15.549 --> 17:19.359
want to put these on my thigh my

17:17.409 --> 17:23.559

17:19.359 --> 17:25.059
other picture of my son baby portraits

17:23.559 --> 17:28.148

17:25.059 --> 17:31.690
they're such subtle features and shading

17:28.148 --> 17:33.549
it's so easy to mess up please do not

17:31.690 --> 17:39.490

17:43.630 --> 17:50.200

17:47.679 --> 17:52.090
big there's no way to do a precision

17:50.200 --> 17:56.799
portrait on something the size of a dime

17:52.090 --> 18:00.960
do not want this tattoo please to hurt

18:18.900 --> 18:29.640
definitely don't want this canvas not

18:26.820 --> 18:33.799
baby face plus our heart black Cobra is

18:29.640 --> 18:33.799
going to gun for everybody

18:35.520 --> 18:40.050
definitely not the best portrait

18:37.260 --> 18:42.570
tattooer so I'm already screwed on this

18:40.050 --> 18:43.860
one how much more is black Cobra is

18:42.570 --> 18:46.290
going to screw me

18:43.860 --> 18:48.750
okay canvases one by one please read the

18:46.290 --> 18:50.540
name on the bottom of your skull empire

old town ink yeah

18:57.530 --> 19:01.150
but still a coach a two

19:07.510 --> 19:14.299
right its powers artistic skin designs

19:12.169 --> 19:15.440
you can recall that one happened again

19:14.299 --> 19:16.940
I'm freaking out

19:15.440 --> 19:20.890
I've never done a portrait of a toddler

19:16.940 --> 19:20.890
and it's gonna be awful

19:24.150 --> 19:28.800
unkindness art I hope you guys are ready

19:27.030 --> 19:32.900
to do battle because if we make it

19:28.800 --> 19:36.350
through this one I'm coming for you a

19:32.900 --> 19:36.350
libera arts

19:38.789 --> 19:44.590
classic trilogy tattoo

19:41.780 --> 19:47.350
black Cobra tattoos

19:44.590 --> 19:51.820
I can't see the day job that picture is

19:47.350 --> 19:55.029
this big golden skull tattoo elegant hey

19:51.820 --> 19:56.860
puss we got hit with the hardest one on

19:55.029 --> 19:58.539
our first day so we're just keeping with

19:56.860 --> 20:02.980
the tradition that you earned your first

19:58.539 --> 20:06.100
day here you will have six hours to

20:02.980 --> 20:10.800
tattoo a precise portrait based on your

20:06.100 --> 20:13.770
work one shop will be out good luck

20:10.800 --> 20:15.750
looks like yeah portraits are already a

20:13.770 --> 20:18.570
challenging job but the kicker here is

20:15.750 --> 20:20.490
they both have to match justly it looks

20:18.570 --> 20:21.960
a little big yeah all right

20:20.490 --> 20:23.490
there's definitely gaps in some of these

20:21.960 --> 20:25.410
teams pretty much gonna be close to this

20:23.490 --> 20:27.660
actual size maybe I hear we'll see when

20:25.410 --> 20:29.610
we draw it out for people that are not

20:27.660 --> 20:32.640
as strong as their teammate that's a

20:29.610 --> 20:35.430
story my favorite day I know you sit on

20:32.640 --> 20:37.500
the line that you want to color yes if

20:35.430 --> 20:39.900
we can't talk them down to at least a

20:37.500 --> 20:42.030
black and gray picture of her face we're

20:39.900 --> 20:43.860
going home for sure to get all the

20:42.030 --> 20:45.390
details and everything and we're at base

20:43.860 --> 20:47.400
yeah I haven't really looked like you if

20:45.390 --> 20:48.630
we focus on your face so it's bigger all

20:47.400 --> 20:50.310
these details are gonna be much more

20:48.630 --> 20:53.790
open and it's gonna last better over

20:50.310 --> 20:54.690
time I'm flexible with a he is a sir

20:53.790 --> 21:01.020
that's awesome

20:54.690 --> 21:02.880
those are the words I love to hear okay

21:01.020 --> 21:04.710
black Cobra definitely screwed us they

21:02.880 --> 21:08.040
gave us the little tiny picture what do

21:04.710 --> 21:10.740
we got what do we got what we got it's

21:08.040 --> 21:13.380
so hard to blow a little tiny photo up

21:10.740 --> 21:14.430
to get a good quality portrait it's all

21:13.380 --> 21:16.350
theirs greenie

21:14.430 --> 21:19.230
I'm kind of nervous right now because

21:16.350 --> 21:20.670
Aaron got kicked out on portrait day and

21:19.230 --> 21:22.860
you know what I was in the bottom last

21:20.670 --> 21:24.540
time I did one but I'm not ready to go

21:22.860 --> 21:26.160
home yet we just got here

21:24.540 --> 21:28.980
they totally shot our foot right now

21:26.160 --> 21:34.309
they give us the worst picture ever

21:28.980 --> 21:36.900
[Music]

21:34.309 --> 21:40.410
because you do more portraits I'm gonna

21:36.900 --> 21:42.299
watch you make this stencil for it so we

21:40.410 --> 21:44.910
can make match I don't have a problem

21:42.299 --> 21:46.740
doing that at all do you want me to

21:44.910 --> 21:48.660
trace mine and then use just looking

21:46.740 --> 21:50.610
right yeah we're already different

21:48.660 --> 21:53.020
this is pace line let's get these things

21:50.610 --> 21:55.179
exactly

21:53.020 --> 21:57.070
so you don't hear it I don't think we

21:55.179 --> 21:58.900
should do the lines and all that just a

21:57.070 --> 22:00.010
little bit of shadow 10 look exactly

21:58.900 --> 22:03.370
just you know we're done

22:00.010 --> 22:06.450
what's it gonna be right okay artists

22:03.370 --> 22:10.840
you will have six hours to tattoo

22:06.450 --> 22:12.860
matching portraits your time

22:10.840 --> 22:14.730
starts

22:12.860 --> 22:16.380
now

22:14.730 --> 22:18.210
right yes

22:16.380 --> 22:19.910
when you go get a board trip you don't

22:18.210 --> 22:21.720
want it to almost look like the person

22:19.910 --> 22:22.799
almost don't count

22:21.720 --> 22:24.000
I guess you go a little bit smaller than

22:22.799 --> 22:25.350
less and a little bit bigger than that

22:24.000 --> 22:27.419
it's very important that they stay

22:25.350 --> 22:29.309
precise to the photo as well as to each

22:27.419 --> 22:30.840
other this is tough you don't know if

22:29.309 --> 22:32.640
your partner's gonna go off on the

22:30.840 --> 22:35.110
tangent and do something crazy are you

22:32.640 --> 22:39.970
super ready let's do this

22:35.110 --> 22:39.970
[Music]

22:40.470 --> 22:44.430
can you check what I'm doing to make

22:42.630 --> 22:46.380
sure that we're on the same page yeah I

22:44.430 --> 22:48.240
am at Eva's mercy on this one I'm

22:46.380 --> 22:51.060
definitely not the best portrait

22:48.240 --> 22:53.790
tattooer so this is the gap where it's

22:51.060 --> 22:56.310
like where this is yeah there's one

22:53.790 --> 23:01.800
lower and one higher there kind of

22:56.310 --> 23:02.880
rapper yeah you got it I know that she

23:01.800 --> 23:04.470
knows what she's doing

23:02.880 --> 23:06.360
so I'm just gonna try to do the same

23:04.470 --> 23:10.650
it's a trust game at this point

23:06.360 --> 23:14.070
oh you're skiing it's really red really

23:10.650 --> 23:15.840
oh yeah oh my god

23:14.070 --> 23:17.760
her skin is lighting up like a damn

23:15.840 --> 23:19.620
Christmas tree you see how they climbed

23:17.760 --> 23:21.240
off you know just making sure because

23:19.620 --> 23:23.340
it's like getting real here it is so I

23:21.240 --> 23:25.830
have to be like super down I have to do

23:23.340 --> 23:28.770
a super subtle soft baby portrait but I

23:25.830 --> 23:30.900
can't tell how dark the incas I'm so

23:28.770 --> 23:36.030
screwed

23:30.900 --> 23:36.030
you have 4 more hours remaining

23:37.020 --> 23:41.190
what do you got for it in this section

23:38.310 --> 23:43.020
is that a 1 and this is a skin tone or

23:41.190 --> 23:44.850
is that most likely I haven't gotten

23:43.020 --> 23:46.890
there yet okay I'm a little worried

23:44.850 --> 23:48.870
about Tom because it has been so long

23:46.890 --> 23:53.040
since he's done a portrait I'm gonna say

23:48.870 --> 23:55.170
that's skin time yeah that's good all

23:53.040 --> 23:56.790
right I'm sorry that's a 1 I just hope

23:55.170 --> 23:58.320
that he can rely on my strengths to help

23:56.790 --> 23:59.820
guide him through it because you can't

23:58.320 --> 24:05.040
wander on a portrait you have to do

23:59.820 --> 24:06.540
exactly what's in front of you thanks

24:05.040 --> 24:08.010
for the mini pic over here trying to

24:06.540 --> 24:11.310
give us the bad skull and then we uh

24:08.010 --> 24:13.170
what's up step to this stage homie yeah

24:11.310 --> 24:14.940
but I don't think it'd work cuz I got

24:13.170 --> 24:15.870
the skills to pay the bills man you know

24:14.940 --> 24:17.550
what we're just gonna have to bike the

24:15.870 --> 24:19.290
boy and I'm about to pull out every

24:17.550 --> 24:21.240
trick I got in my bag to take this

24:19.290 --> 24:23.370
little tiny photo and make a great

24:21.240 --> 24:25.770
portrait

24:23.370 --> 24:27.540
how we gonna judge this we may have some

24:25.770 --> 24:29.820
clear bottoms which might save us a lot

24:27.540 --> 24:31.650
of hard work allegory arts they're just

24:29.820 --> 24:33.809
using color photos thrown off to the

24:31.650 --> 24:36.540
side on a black and gray portrait that's

24:33.809 --> 24:38.190
crazy and their back to each other she's

24:36.540 --> 24:40.440
not even looking at the photo she's just

24:38.190 --> 24:42.240
happening the artistic skin design did

24:40.440 --> 24:44.340
you notice the skin differences canvas

24:42.240 --> 24:46.350
is everything that we've got an older

24:44.340 --> 24:48.600
woman a young lady their skins react

24:46.350 --> 24:49.980
different one just you put grain and

24:48.600 --> 24:52.080
it's great the other one and put the

24:49.980 --> 24:54.360
same gray and it don't look like nothing

24:52.080 --> 24:57.390
it's just our beet red by the kindness

24:54.360 --> 24:59.940
heart to her portrait phenom it's the

24:57.390 --> 25:03.290
one but if he doesn't step it up to her

24:59.940 --> 25:06.870
now yeah they can lose what's up down

25:03.290 --> 25:09.360
yeah you guys are flying holy crap it is

25:06.870 --> 25:10.650
overly a parent that doom has never done

25:09.360 --> 25:12.480
a portrait in his life

25:10.650 --> 25:14.640
no you're gonna do it this competition

25:12.480 --> 25:18.210
instead you come in here and scratch

25:14.640 --> 25:18.929
something out on that dude's arm that's

25:18.210 --> 25:23.630
ridiculous

25:18.929 --> 25:23.630
final hour one hour to go

25:26.440 --> 25:30.280
I just really need you to relax your

25:28.750 --> 25:33.809
shoulders the more chance you are the

25:30.280 --> 25:33.809
worse it's gonna be for both of us

25:33.940 --> 25:42.800
my canvas is like tattooing a crying

25:38.530 --> 25:45.500
squealing mechanical bull this was like

25:42.800 --> 25:47.870
30 seconds work we're turning into ten

25:45.500 --> 25:50.180
minutes right now if she does not just

25:47.870 --> 25:52.740
sit still and let me do my job

25:50.180 --> 25:57.000
we might not finish it all

25:52.740 --> 25:58.950
I can hear Aaron's campus moaning from

25:57.000 --> 26:01.470
across the shop Danes

25:58.950 --> 26:04.530
tattoo turns red every time he touches

26:01.470 --> 26:05.130
the lady I'm over here like a fish out

26:04.530 --> 26:07.380
of water

26:05.130 --> 26:09.570
I don't know how black Cobra figured out

26:07.380 --> 26:11.880
how to get us all at one time but they

26:09.570 --> 26:14.150
definitely have the Alliance is in

26:11.880 --> 26:14.150
trouble

26:14.490 --> 26:19.920
five

26:15.960 --> 26:23.040
four three two one

26:19.920 --> 26:24.820
that is it machines down time is up no

26:23.040 --> 26:26.230
more ink

26:24.820 --> 26:30.100
let's take a look and see what we got

26:26.230 --> 26:33.700
here it's also great yeah look at that

26:30.100 --> 26:36.400
are they twins what's going on here is

26:33.700 --> 26:37.090
awesome looks like mom absolutely could

26:36.400 --> 26:39.340
do that for you guys

26:37.090 --> 26:42.190
Thanks absolutely this is awesome for

26:39.340 --> 26:45.580
sure stages of stress today we're insane

26:42.190 --> 26:47.770
no I'm like yeah totally if it's gonna

26:45.580 --> 26:49.360
get worse well I'm glad I got warmed up

26:47.770 --> 26:51.580
on that one bring it on

26:49.360 --> 26:54.119
six more to send home dude we kill you I

26:51.580 --> 26:56.159
think we did good

26:54.119 --> 26:57.719
you jerk words wisely because you had

26:56.159 --> 27:00.029
the worst tattoo I've ever seen this

26:57.719 --> 27:01.469
back is getting ready carry you if

27:00.029 --> 27:05.479
you're not looking at the kid they look

27:01.469 --> 27:05.479
like one old man too much of a mess

27:08.650 --> 27:13.300
[Music]

27:10.590 --> 27:15.160
the worst tattoo on their team was

27:13.300 --> 27:17.560
better than your best test I don't agree

27:15.160 --> 27:19.870
you don't think Babak Slade you dude he

27:17.560 --> 27:22.810
owned you come on see I disagree I think

27:19.870 --> 27:25.000
there's was words wisely because you had

27:22.810 --> 27:26.140
the worst actor I've ever seen dude I

27:25.000 --> 27:27.460
was actually worried about you guys

27:26.140 --> 27:28.900
first few challenges and now I'm just

27:27.460 --> 27:29.800
like with all competition I'm still

27:28.900 --> 27:31.240
waiting for you to arrive because

27:29.800 --> 27:32.680
everybody's complimenting DJ how great

27:31.240 --> 27:35.350
your team is doing his back is getting

27:32.680 --> 27:37.120
ready carrying you I'm fine right in the

27:35.350 --> 27:38.110
middle of the end I know you haven't

27:37.120 --> 27:39.370
wrote the middle you've been in the

27:38.110 --> 27:42.840
bottom we've only been in the bottom

27:39.370 --> 27:42.840
twice three strikes you're out

27:58.720 --> 28:05.240
yeah Holly good to see you back Oliver

28:02.240 --> 28:06.049
Peck is back with us feeling good we're

28:05.240 --> 28:07.760
worried about you

28:06.049 --> 28:10.250
I had a heart attack I got a couple

28:07.760 --> 28:10.880
stents put in I'm now better than I was

28:10.250 --> 28:14.480
before

28:10.880 --> 28:17.000
ready to go thank you thank you today

28:14.480 --> 28:19.549
you had to tattoo the ultimate test of

28:17.000 --> 28:21.500
precision matching portraits clean and

28:19.549 --> 28:23.929
Erin this challenge was designed to test

28:21.500 --> 28:26.110
your weaknesses golden skull tattoos

28:23.929 --> 28:29.090
you're up first

28:26.110 --> 28:30.950
clean did you practice before you came

28:29.090 --> 28:32.870
yes I definitely want to tip my hat to

28:30.950 --> 28:34.520
you man you did a great portrait here

28:32.870 --> 28:36.230
the eyes and the mouth you hit them

28:34.520 --> 28:38.210
perfectly especially that little

28:36.230 --> 28:40.280
turned-up corner of the lip on the right

28:38.210 --> 28:42.260
side is what really captures her look

28:40.280 --> 28:44.929
Erin I like the way you did the black in

28:42.260 --> 28:47.030
the hair your hair maybe is a little bit

28:44.929 --> 28:48.559
better than cleans but as far as the

28:47.030 --> 28:50.059
application on the face and everything

28:48.559 --> 28:52.190
clean might have made a little more

28:50.059 --> 28:54.590
smooth y'all did a great job taking the

28:52.190 --> 28:56.000
exact same approach on the tattoo I mean

28:54.590 --> 28:58.100
you really try to mimic each other

28:56.000 --> 29:03.610
stencil to the tee there's a lot of

28:58.100 --> 29:06.160
precision in this tattoos allegory arts

29:03.610 --> 29:07.630
we very clearly missed a mark on details

29:06.160 --> 29:09.850
in the photo you all had the same

29:07.630 --> 29:12.550
approach for this nose but that is not a

29:09.850 --> 29:12.850
human nose it has a very feline look to

29:12.550 --> 29:14.860
it

29:12.850 --> 29:16.840
ulis the tattoo doesn't look like this

29:14.860 --> 29:19.000
little girl the eyes they're just

29:16.840 --> 29:20.290
different shapes even I think you did

29:19.000 --> 29:22.180
get in there with a lot more precise

29:20.290 --> 29:24.100
detail on the hair and overall the

29:22.180 --> 29:25.990
technique and the shading is smoother

29:24.100 --> 29:28.120
but you still distort the shape of her

29:25.990 --> 29:30.430
face the shading you put above her left

29:28.120 --> 29:32.230
eye you create these intentions and

29:30.430 --> 29:34.120
protrusions that just aren't there on a

29:32.230 --> 29:38.490
precision day you need to pay exact

29:34.120 --> 29:38.490
attention to every single little detail

29:40.410 --> 29:47.860
the coffin yeah silica tattoo judging

29:46.210 --> 29:49.060
these tattoos individually they both

29:47.860 --> 29:50.680
look like the photo they're both

29:49.060 --> 29:52.390
captured the girl but we're definitely

29:50.680 --> 29:54.790
looking at completely different images

29:52.390 --> 29:56.590
here Nolan in the photo she has a

29:54.790 --> 29:58.390
certain look in her face that's like

29:56.590 --> 30:00.100
she's gentle and you're she looks like

29:58.390 --> 30:02.320
she's mad and aggressive there's some

30:00.100 --> 30:03.940
precision obviously in these tattoos the

30:02.320 --> 30:06.040
only thing is you want to make them look

30:03.940 --> 30:07.810
the same big picture they both got

30:06.040 --> 30:09.340
decent tattoos but I don't know if

30:07.810 --> 30:11.520
decent tattoos are gonna win the

30:09.340 --> 30:11.520
competition

30:12.230 --> 30:18.380
Empire State Studio looking at these if

30:16.700 --> 30:20.750
I looked really quick I would think it

30:18.380 --> 30:22.370
was the same tattoo Tommy it a little

30:20.750 --> 30:24.049
bit better in the hairline did a little

30:22.370 --> 30:26.450
bit better in the hair but as far as the

30:24.049 --> 30:28.100
overall softness of the face Marvin I

30:26.450 --> 30:29.960
think you really kill it this is

30:28.100 --> 30:31.340
precision day so we're being precise on

30:29.960 --> 30:37.389
our critiques and guys definitely hit

30:31.340 --> 30:37.389
the mark unkindness art

30:37.490 --> 30:41.940
the divide is monstrous between these

30:41.130 --> 30:44.490
two tattoos

30:41.940 --> 30:46.830
well iron technically very smooth very

30:44.490 --> 30:49.409
professionally done kidding no

30:46.830 --> 30:51.299
sugarcoating this tattoo man's feet the

30:49.409 --> 30:52.769
hair is just messy

30:51.299 --> 30:54.659
there's scratchy lines that you can

30:52.769 --> 30:56.250
still see through where the black is and

30:54.659 --> 31:00.690
the areas where you're supposed to have

30:56.250 --> 31:02.970
soft details nose eyes lips chin neck

31:00.690 --> 31:04.590
it's just rough this is my first

31:02.970 --> 31:06.059
portrait that's part of being a ink

31:04.590 --> 31:07.860
master you got to be able to do

31:06.059 --> 31:11.820
everything blood as a ship or sink as a

31:07.860 --> 31:14.720
ship today you're sinking classic

31:11.820 --> 31:14.720
trilogy tattoo

31:14.890 --> 31:19.390
let's keep it 100 your tattoos they're

31:17.649 --> 31:21.370
different big time the hair looks

31:19.390 --> 31:24.460
different the eyes look different the

31:21.370 --> 31:26.830
nose is the mouth overall Derek's looks

31:24.460 --> 31:28.990
more like the photo Tom's eyes are doing

31:26.830 --> 31:31.480
different things one's looking up once

31:28.990 --> 31:34.149
bugging out you create this real stern

31:31.480 --> 31:35.740
lip on that right eye that gives it more

31:34.149 --> 31:39.299
of a creature type feature on the

31:35.740 --> 31:39.299
outside swing-and-a-miss

31:40.110 --> 31:44.339
Oh tonic

31:42.539 --> 31:46.739
both you've hit the mark on capturing

31:44.339 --> 31:48.029
the kid but as far as a team this is

31:46.739 --> 31:49.799
another one whether it's a definite

31:48.029 --> 31:50.879
divide between the two tattoos well I

31:49.799 --> 31:51.479
think you've progressed a lot as a

31:50.879 --> 31:53.759
tattooer

31:51.479 --> 31:55.829
but DJ's tattoo is the HD version of

31:53.759 --> 31:58.559
yours looks like if you took the other

31:55.829 --> 32:01.229
one and you just shine DJ you captured

31:58.559 --> 32:02.849
the eyes perfect the nose is perfect the

32:01.229 --> 32:05.249
mouth here is perfect to me

32:02.849 --> 32:06.719
you keep tattooing like this bro the

32:05.249 --> 32:10.349
rest of the competition and you're gonna

32:06.719 --> 32:14.989
be able to buy new jeans a boy shirt and

32:10.349 --> 32:14.989
take classes to tie those shoes Thanks

32:15.049 --> 32:20.390
artistic skin design

32:18.590 --> 32:22.250
usually you look at a portrait in your

32:20.390 --> 32:24.440
drama the eyes I'm drawn to the clothing

32:22.250 --> 32:26.750
on both of them that sweater and that

32:24.440 --> 32:28.370
shirt I see precision all day but it

32:26.750 --> 32:30.260
just looks like a different artist did

32:28.370 --> 32:32.540
the top huh in both of them

32:30.260 --> 32:34.190
the hair is completely different he

32:32.540 --> 32:36.140
brought the left side down a little

32:34.190 --> 32:38.240
further in April you brought the right

32:36.140 --> 32:40.790
side up a little they're not consistent

32:38.240 --> 32:47.300
or precise with the photo and certainly

32:40.790 --> 32:49.400
not with each other black Cobra tattoos

32:47.300 --> 32:51.200
there's precision in terms of being

32:49.400 --> 32:52.970
similar in your approach on the tattoo

32:51.200 --> 32:54.710
but they're equally different from the

32:52.970 --> 32:57.020
program I don't feel like either of you

32:54.710 --> 32:59.510
hit the hair in any way there's a lot of

32:57.020 --> 33:01.850
inferred made up kind of styles and that

32:59.510 --> 33:03.080
changes the dynamic of her face also

33:01.850 --> 33:05.150
shading in the face

33:03.080 --> 33:07.520
it doesn't look soft like skin it looks

33:05.150 --> 33:11.770
like fur when you look at one tattoo to

33:07.520 --> 33:11.770
the next there's a lot of differences

33:12.520 --> 33:17.960
judges time to announce who had the best

33:15.260 --> 33:19.640
tattoos of the day I think that golden

33:17.960 --> 33:21.710
skull did really great yep for me I

33:19.640 --> 33:23.930
think it's Empire State both look like

33:21.710 --> 33:26.150
the man both look like the same tattoo

33:23.930 --> 33:28.610
can't get past the top of the hair on

33:26.150 --> 33:30.080
Marvin's tattoo I'm leaning towards

33:28.610 --> 33:33.260
golden sculpt but I think they're both

33:30.080 --> 33:36.530
sculptures that's your call final

33:33.260 --> 33:40.320
decision golden skull Oliver Empire

33:36.530 --> 33:43.440
State I have to say golden skull

33:40.320 --> 33:45.590
my decision is golden skull the judges

33:43.440 --> 33:48.720
have decided the best tattoos of the day

33:45.590 --> 33:51.390
go to golden skull is back up alright

33:48.720 --> 33:53.850
guys as the jury appears you must all

33:51.390 --> 33:57.290
deliberate and put one shop up for

33:53.850 --> 33:57.290
elimination head back to the loft

33:59.130 --> 34:06.100
we need to all make sure that we are on

34:02.320 --> 34:09.159
the same plan here artistic and allegory

34:06.100 --> 34:10.360
easily had the bottom tattoo yes we need

34:09.159 --> 34:12.070
to get rid of at least one of them

34:10.360 --> 34:13.540
because this is a numbers game at this

34:12.070 --> 34:15.850
point I think they're gonna deflect onto

34:13.540 --> 34:18.129
the YouTube when we go down there today

34:15.850 --> 34:19.659
point out Falls and absolutely just got

34:18.129 --> 34:21.460
to be paying attention we're gonna take

34:19.659 --> 34:22.840
control we need to take control we're

34:21.460 --> 34:24.760
gonna get rid of things this is the best

34:22.840 --> 34:26.469
time to do it it is allegories time

34:24.760 --> 34:28.869
they've been in the bottom many times

34:26.469 --> 34:30.699
more time before to go down if they go

34:28.869 --> 34:33.239
down it's their turn to go forth time

34:30.699 --> 34:33.239
and you're out

34:37.730 --> 34:41.480
where here's the jury appears the

34:39.830 --> 34:43.550
determined woodshop will be put up for

34:41.480 --> 34:45.290
elimination I would just say unkindness

34:43.550 --> 34:47.780
it shouldn't be on the bottom

34:45.290 --> 34:49.580
Erin's was so good coming to a

34:47.780 --> 34:51.918
competition and not even graduating a

34:49.580 --> 34:53.330
portrait that's just ballsy but I felt

34:51.918 --> 34:55.940
like I tried my hardest it essentially

34:53.330 --> 34:57.260
is the Achilles heel again all right you

34:55.940 --> 34:58.550
could coffin say stupid things like bull

34:57.260 --> 35:00.650
yeah but your heel should've been all

34:58.550 --> 35:02.210
you were practicing then if you zoom in

35:00.650 --> 35:03.470
there's a lot of technical parts I think

35:02.210 --> 35:04.630
if we're calling out technical stuff

35:03.470 --> 35:07.580
classic trophy

35:04.630 --> 35:09.740
this thing has a lot of choppy weirdly

35:07.580 --> 35:11.359
put in blacks and I feel like there's

35:09.740 --> 35:13.220
look just as different as what else dude

35:11.359 --> 35:14.930
there is a divide but it's not as big as

35:13.220 --> 35:16.670
your guys house both looked like the

35:14.930 --> 35:19.430
girl where neither of these look like

35:16.670 --> 35:21.470
the girl I feel like I actually have

35:19.430 --> 35:23.180
more issues with allegory this doesn't

35:21.470 --> 35:25.730
look like a human child I don't think it

35:23.180 --> 35:27.740
was that bad the lips are black the eyes

35:25.730 --> 35:30.320
are black the only place I actually used

35:27.740 --> 35:32.000
black was her pupils but it looks black

35:30.320 --> 35:34.970
I think this looks more like a

35:32.000 --> 35:36.859
first-time portrait than them do yes I

35:34.970 --> 35:38.510
agree I feel like a little bit more

35:36.859 --> 35:40.100
strongly about classic trilogies that's

35:38.510 --> 35:42.500
because they don't match and the

35:40.100 --> 35:43.280
technical aspect isn't as strong as even

35:42.500 --> 35:45.820
Ulysses

35:43.280 --> 35:45.820
that's where I met

35:46.780 --> 35:51.170
alright guys today we're testing

35:48.590 --> 35:52.520
precision who do you guys think are on

35:51.170 --> 35:54.200
the chopping block to go home

35:52.520 --> 35:57.110
technically the worst tattoo of the day

35:54.200 --> 35:58.580
is doom kid but does doom get off the

35:57.110 --> 36:01.190
hook because Aaron's is so nice

35:58.580 --> 36:04.670
definitely but he looks more like the

36:01.190 --> 36:06.680
girl than allegory arts neither of these

36:04.670 --> 36:08.600
tattoos look like each other nor do they

36:06.680 --> 36:10.820
look like the child how do the eyes that

36:08.600 --> 36:12.980
occurred on Eva's face how does that

36:10.820 --> 36:15.110
even occur it's a difficult picture but

36:12.980 --> 36:16.640
you see the same mistakes replicated

36:15.110 --> 36:18.290
that aren't even in the picture so it's

36:16.640 --> 36:19.310
almost like they made the same blind

36:18.290 --> 36:23.120
leading the blind

36:19.310 --> 36:25.190
and then artistics these things they

36:23.120 --> 36:26.960
must have wasted 4 and a half hours on

36:25.190 --> 36:29.600
that little sweater and collar in about

36:26.960 --> 36:31.340
an hour and a half on the face but I'd

36:29.600 --> 36:33.200
rather have classic in the bottom I

36:31.340 --> 36:35.630
don't think either one of them capture a

36:33.200 --> 36:36.590
portrait style tattoo or this face they

36:35.630 --> 36:38.330
just look different

36:36.590 --> 36:40.160
that jury appears is deliberating right

36:38.330 --> 36:41.780
now and they're gonna put a shop up for

36:40.160 --> 36:44.390
elimination so they could help us make

36:41.780 --> 36:46.660
this decision yeah it's rough poor cute

36:44.390 --> 36:48.729
days always tricky

36:46.660 --> 36:50.140
do you guys think one person is steppin

36:48.729 --> 36:51.849
on the team is worse than two people I

36:50.140 --> 36:55.319
don't but they were really hammered him

36:51.849 --> 36:55.319
like really hammer me hard

36:59.460 --> 37:03.869
all right jury appears which shop you

37:01.500 --> 37:07.589
sitting down for elimination the jury of

37:03.869 --> 37:10.140
peers has voted allegory Arts all right

37:07.589 --> 37:14.430
we'll see allegory arts artistic skin

37:10.140 --> 37:17.819
design and classic trilogy see everybody

37:14.430 --> 37:19.770
downstairs man you just missed that one

37:17.819 --> 37:22.170
yeah by the skin of our goddamn teeth

37:19.770 --> 37:26.089
Nikki oh and a steak dinner on that one

37:22.170 --> 37:26.089
all right guys let's do it

37:26.530 --> 37:29.719
[Music]

37:33.869 --> 37:38.940
today you had to prove that your

37:35.969 --> 37:41.569
precision is on point based on your work

37:38.940 --> 37:44.489
one shop will be packing their machines

37:41.569 --> 37:46.559
all right jury appears why did you vote

37:44.489 --> 37:49.859
allegory arts to the bottom this was the

37:46.559 --> 37:51.509
cutest most adorable subject and that's

37:49.859 --> 37:53.400
not what the tattoos look like guys

37:51.509 --> 37:56.069
there's a lot of things here that aren't

37:53.400 --> 37:59.009
off the discrepancy in the eyes the wise

37:56.069 --> 38:01.170
in the nose just a huge head shaker they

37:59.009 --> 38:03.479
look closer to the same artist than

38:01.170 --> 38:05.849
classic trilogy does but I put a face

38:03.479 --> 38:07.410
that was more accurate to the photo yeah

38:05.849 --> 38:09.119
I think that you look at classic

38:07.410 --> 38:10.799
trilogies neither one of them look like

38:09.119 --> 38:12.390
the photo and either one of them look

38:10.799 --> 38:13.890
like each other and then you get into

38:12.390 --> 38:16.619
the technical aspect and it's so

38:13.890 --> 38:18.809
haphazardly done if they both looked

38:16.619 --> 38:19.469
exactly like yours Derek I would have no

38:18.809 --> 38:20.999
problem

38:19.469 --> 38:23.849
I definitely drop the ball this

38:20.999 --> 38:25.380
application is just messy just look at

38:23.849 --> 38:28.559
the hair and you're like what is that

38:25.380 --> 38:30.150
but it is a woman artistic skin design

38:28.559 --> 38:31.829
if you're not looking at the kid they

38:30.150 --> 38:33.930
look like little old men both these

38:31.829 --> 38:36.029
tattoos have a very undone feel for me

38:33.930 --> 38:37.799
normally I do portraits but I build up

38:36.029 --> 38:40.319
layers and there is no build enough

38:37.799 --> 38:41.910
layers well I think you just panicked it

38:40.319 --> 38:43.469
started getting red and you're like damn

38:41.910 --> 38:45.059
I don't want to put no more but

38:43.469 --> 38:47.069
sometimes you just gotta trust your

38:45.059 --> 38:49.259
skill if you woulda tattooed the rest of

38:47.069 --> 38:50.519
the portrait at the level you tattooed

38:49.259 --> 38:51.650
the clothing you wouldn't have been

38:50.519 --> 38:53.450
there you know

38:51.650 --> 38:55.790
well we do have to make a decision here

38:53.450 --> 38:57.530
when it's this close I just got a look

38:55.790 --> 39:00.650
at that first glance and when I first

38:57.530 --> 39:03.230
glance at classic trilogy it's like my

39:00.650 --> 39:05.990
votes for classic trilogy too much of a

39:03.230 --> 39:09.410
mess classic trilogy I'm just a canvas

39:05.990 --> 39:12.230
and allegory looks like a weird kid my

39:09.410 --> 39:14.990
vote is for allegory I'd rather wear

39:12.230 --> 39:17.570
Derek's tattoo than any of allegory but

39:14.990 --> 39:20.000
it's a competition it's not what I want

39:17.570 --> 39:22.370
it's what the competition wants so they

39:20.000 --> 39:24.880
did them exactly alike they did them

39:22.370 --> 39:24.880
different

39:27.210 --> 39:31.770
I guess I would have to say classic the

39:30.420 --> 39:34.560
judges have decided

39:31.770 --> 39:36.570
classic trilogy tattoo you do not have

39:34.560 --> 39:38.160
what it takes to be master shop and ice

39:36.570 --> 39:39.960
tattoo a little different and I think

39:38.160 --> 39:42.089
that's what got you here learn from this

39:39.960 --> 39:44.990
hell yeah please pack your machines and

39:42.089 --> 39:44.990
move out

39:47.730 --> 39:51.840
that was an interesting development yeah

39:50.310 --> 39:52.740
there's the Alliance in the house and we

39:51.840 --> 39:54.000
have a little nickname for him we

39:52.740 --> 39:56.609
calling the cool kids and who do cool

39:54.000 --> 39:57.930
kids pick on the Nerds I think that's

39:56.609 --> 40:00.420
the thing that more frustrating losing

39:57.930 --> 40:02.100
too poorly done babies over you know

40:00.420 --> 40:03.540
anything else but whatever it was

40:02.100 --> 40:04.740
definitely persuaded down there so I

40:03.540 --> 40:06.359
take it sort of as a backhanded

40:04.740 --> 40:08.220
compliment like obviously they saw us as

40:06.359 --> 40:09.720
a threat I think in this place we showed

40:08.220 --> 40:11.970
them what classic trilogy tattoos

40:09.720 --> 40:15.590
provides every client was happy when I

40:11.970 --> 40:15.590
made me happy oh yeah

40:16.060 --> 40:19.080
let's go do some more

40:20.250 --> 40:27.099
on the next episode of ink master at the

40:24.820 --> 40:28.540
end if it's one strong player a weaker

40:27.099 --> 40:30.190
player that was just dragging the other

40:28.540 --> 40:33.339
weaker teams along you think that's

40:30.190 --> 40:35.140
right just got hot dear your

40:33.339 --> 40:37.710
applications suck they didn't say what

40:35.140 --> 40:40.210
goddamn thing about my application what

40:37.710 --> 40:43.720
today no I know what this guy sends you

40:40.210 --> 40:45.640
at home not bring it I'm going down guns

40:43.720 --> 40:47.589
blazing it is not what you did this

40:45.640 --> 40:49.089
style is totally different it's not the

40:47.589 --> 40:51.310
challenge is the challenge one of the

40:49.089 --> 40:54.220
premier teams is gonna go home I don't
