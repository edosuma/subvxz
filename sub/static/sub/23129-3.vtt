WEBVTT

00:02.730 --> 00:04.494
- Previously...
- Turn me.

00:04.530 --> 00:06.134
What did you do?

00:06.170 --> 00:07.490
- Run!

00:07.540 --> 00:09.167
- I saw your father today.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.530
- Aidan? Did you tell him?

00:10.570 --> 00:11.799
- That his little boy's

00:11.840 --> 00:14.138
grown up to run Boston?

00:14.180 --> 00:16.046
No.
- OK, good.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.400
- I lost my best friend.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.373
- I think I can help him.
- What?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.445
- Donna's magic
got Josh into this.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.312
(Laughing)

00:23.350 --> 00:26.456
(Sally speaking
foreign language)

00:26.490 --> 00:28.117
I'm S O SO I ry I

00:28.160 --> 00:30.185
(Aidan grunting,
werewolf snarling)

00:30.230 --> 00:32.119
(Josh screaming)

00:35.260 --> 00:37.797
- You're safe now.
- The spell wasn't ready.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.730
You shouldn't have
acted without me.

00:39.770 --> 00:41.795
- We couldn't find you!
We couldn't wait.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.400
Not after everything
he went through!

00:49.280 --> 00:50.839
- You know I love that ring.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.769
- Then where the hell is it?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.675
- I told you!
It fell!

00:55.850 --> 00:58.239
No! Not again.

01:02.290 --> 01:03.428
- Ah!

01:05.590 --> 01:08.696
(Danny screaming,
bones crunching)

01:10.400 --> 01:11.526
(Thud)

01:13.340 --> 01:16.230
- Ah! God, that felt good,
didn't it?

01:16.270 --> 01:18.534
Whoo! I am a little flushed.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.669
We're a good team, aren't we?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.400
- (Josh): Sally...

01:26.620 --> 01:28.315
Hey...

01:28.350 --> 01:30.887
You've been reading
that book for 2 days.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.615
Isn't it time to
come up for air?

01:32.660 --> 01:35.288
- Yeah. Can't.
- Get rid of it.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.426
Take it back and bury it in the
soup rubble where you found it,

01:38.460 --> 01:39.723
because it's bad juju.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.751
- Look, this isn't
an encyclopedia of evil.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.360
I need to find out
what I am now,

01:44.400 --> 01:45.765
what I can do,

01:45.800 --> 01:48.360
aside from yanking weapons
out of menstrual blood.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.630
- I love that we have
the kind of relationship

01:50.670 --> 01:52.138
where we can discuss, uh...

01:53.240 --> 01:55.538
menses first thing
in the morning.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.345
But when your pupils
roll back into your face,

01:58.380 --> 01:59.848
and you're growling...

01:59.880 --> 02:01.609
- I was resting my eyes.

02:01.650 --> 02:04.540
- But it's terrifying
when you rest your eyes, so...

02:04.590 --> 02:06.615
- Got a redecorating
spell in there?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.583
"Cause the wildly expensive

02:08.620 --> 02:10.725
wallpaper I bought
keeps falling down!

02:10.759 --> 02:12.728
- Yeah, probably,
if we wait long enough.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.228
Oh yeah, the book changes.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.423
The fairy-trapping spell
I saw yesterday, it's gone!

02:17.470 --> 02:19.165
- Fairy-trapping what?

02:19.200 --> 02:21.168
- Oh yeah. And there's
new spells now.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.669
You need your crops cleared
from a beetle infestation?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.269
I got you.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.938
- Listen to me.
Blood magic, it costs.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.200
You, more than anyone,
should understand that.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.672
I mean, you know
what Donna was.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.575
- Yeah, I'm not
doing blood magic.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.782
That's not what this book is.
Well, most of it.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.312
I only jumped on the blood
train to help save Josh

02:39.360 --> 02:40.782
when no one else could.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.949
Not to toot my own horn
or anything, but... Toot!

02:43.990 --> 02:45.424
- Toot away.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.919
- And may I remind you,
it took you a lifetime --

02:48.960 --> 02:51.190
several lifetimes, actually --

02:51.230 --> 02:53.938
to get a hold of
your feeding and your Kkilling.

02:53.970 --> 02:56.200
You could've
bashed out your fangs

02:56.240 --> 02:59.631
so you wouldn't hurt anyone,
but you didn't.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.274
I can also learn to control
what's inside me.

03:02.310 --> 03:05.245
This book is an operating manual
for whatever it is I am now.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.941
(Sighs)

03:06.980 --> 03:09.813
Can you just trust me?

03:19.630 --> 03:21.689
- First day.

03:21.730 --> 03:24.893
Ready for the awkward
co-worker questions?

03:24.930 --> 03:27.638
- Yes. Yeah.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.605
Wait, you didn't tell everybody
that my mom died, right?

03:30.640 --> 03:38.640
- Never.
- Good.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.656
- ...which,
incidentally, is true.

03:46.690 --> 03:49.330
- When did this happen?
- Two months ago.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.796
Look, we didn't wanna spoil
your one human day a month.

03:52.830 --> 03:56.562
- You didn't tell her about what
was going on with me, right?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.568
- No! No.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.833
I think the whole "vampires
and werewolves are real"

04:02.870 --> 04:05.999
kicked off a binge, and
she just checked herself in.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.600
- Yeah. I thought
she took it awfully well.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.608
I just-- I--I should've
been there.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.540
I should've recognized that
that was gonna happen.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.446
- You were incapacitated.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.983
- All right, any other news?
I'm pretty much numb now.

04:18.019 --> 04:19.488
I can take it.
- Tapped out.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.010
Oh! Before I forget, here.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.858
- No, Nora packed
my lunch already.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.382
- Maple-bacon donuts
for Meredith,

04:25.430 --> 04:26.795
to get back
in her good graces.

04:26.830 --> 04:29.367
- Genius!

04:29.400 --> 04:31.562
When's the administration
gonna catch on

04:31.600 --> 04:34.035
that you, me and Nora are
the worst nurses ever?

04:34.070 --> 04:37.404
Between the 3 of us, we've taken
a combined 18 months leave

04:37.440 --> 04:38.430
in the last 2 years.

04:38.470 --> 04:39.778
- Seriously? Wow!
- Yeah.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.507
Thank God there's a nursing
crisis in this country.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.939
I thought that
funeral home closed

04:46.980 --> 04:50.018
after Bishop... ended.

04:50.050 --> 04:52.951
- It reopened under
new management.

04:52.990 --> 04:55.789
- Just like that?
Is the whole regime coming back?

04:55.820 --> 04:57.026
- I've stayed out of it.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.427
- 'Cause that's usually
super easy for you.

04:59.460 --> 05:03.590
- I think it's time I give them
a lecture on over-dipping.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.997
- Good luck with that!

05:15.740 --> 05:17.879
(Tires squealing)

05:22.650 --> 05:24.379
- OK. All right.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.957
** And I'm leaving...

05:26.990 --> 05:28.355
(Grunting)

05:28.390 --> 05:30.427
(All grunting)

05:35.100 --> 05:37.421
* And every night,
this scene of death *

05:37.470 --> 05:39.495
* Is deep within my mind **

05:39.540 --> 05:41.360
- OK, OK, OK.

05:42.670 --> 05:45.401
Not the head.
Not the head.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.839
I hate that.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.507
(Grunting)

06:03.460 --> 06:04.825
- OK. I'm so sorry.
- Kenny?

06:04.860 --> 06:06.726
- Look, I--I told them
to grab you.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.057
They clearly misunderstood.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.159
This is not how
I wanted you to see me.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.520
- You had me kidnapped?

06:11.570 --> 06:12.935
- Guys, look.

06:12.970 --> 06:15.667
I don't know how many times
you want me to say this.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.429
We don't do that anymore!

06:17.470 --> 06:19.108
When I said
"escort our special guest,”

06:19.140 --> 06:21.507
I literally meant
"bring Aidan to the office."

06:21.540 --> 06:24.646
It wasn't gangster code for
"go Guantnamo Bay." All right?

06:24.680 --> 06:26.671
- You're the new management?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.712
- Yeah. I know,
I don't really look the part.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.718
- But your face...
How did...

06:32.760 --> 06:34.057
- How did I get it back

06:34.090 --> 06:35.785
from being hideous?

06:35.820 --> 06:37.584
Time, mostly.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.520
You know how vampires
can procreate normally now?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.029
The face resumes its usual
hotness after a few weeks.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.665
It's like the chicken pox.
- OK, uh...

06:46.700 --> 06:48.930
So, you're back.
Welcome back.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.199
(Sighs)

06:50.240 --> 06:53.073
Look, why didn't you
just get a hold of me?

06:53.110 --> 06:56.569
- What? Come say hello?

06:56.610 --> 06:59.443
Yeah. Well, anyways, you know,
not having to skulk around

06:59.480 --> 07:01.574
like Quasimodo definitely
has its advantages.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.783
I'll give you a sneak peek of
the rest of the operation.

07:04.820 --> 07:07.915
- There's an operation?
- Yes.

07:09.890 --> 07:10.982
(Telephone ringing)

07:11.030 --> 07:12.953
(Woman speaking
over PA, indistinct)

07:13.000 --> 07:14.855
(Machine beeping)

07:14.900 --> 07:16.925
(Telephone ringing, echoing)

07:16.970 --> 07:18.699
- (Woman on PA):
Dr. Manson, 463.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.767
- (Man on TV):
We have breaking news.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.939
With the recent heavy rains,
a flood warning

07:22.970 --> 07:24.529
is now in effect

07:24.570 --> 07:26.971
for the entire southern
portion of the state.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.945
Residents near levees
or in low-lying areas

07:29.980 --> 07:32.779
are urged to evacuate.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.948
- (Doctor):
I need a hand in here!

07:34.980 --> 07:35.970
Josh!

07:36.020 --> 07:38.614
(Woman moaning)

07:38.650 --> 07:40.789
(Machines beeping,
heart beating)

07:52.230 --> 07:54.198
- 5 mg of Diazepam.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.907
- Good call.

08:15.790 --> 08:16.757
- Oh my God!

08:19.900 --> 08:22.255
A spell to bring back my door!

08:25.730 --> 08:28.529
No! Stop! Stop! Stop!

08:28.570 --> 08:29.708
Stop!

08:32.740 --> 08:35.801
(Voice breaking): Sorry, guys.
I already missed it once.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.571
(Exhales sharply)

08:38.610 --> 08:41.078
(Speaking foreign language)

08:57.600 --> 09:02.140
(Continues speaking
foreign language)

09:06.780 --> 09:08.270
(Whooshing)

09:09.710 --> 09:12.919
- Ding do
- No! g'

09:12.950 --> 09:14.145
- Thanks for the invite.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.787
That's your problem,
in a nutshell.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.128
- I was trying to
call back my door.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.094
- Didn't your mother
ever tell you?

09:28.130 --> 09:31.623
If something seems too good to
be true, then it probably is.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.263
- You put that spell
in the book.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.769
From down there,
you can control it?

09:35.800 --> 09:39.338
- I paid for this book
with my life. Many of us did.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.873
- Is there a spell
to bring back your door?

09:41.910 --> 09:44.208
- You think it's that easy
to just move on?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.719
I'm just hanging around here
to play dominoes?

09:46.750 --> 09:49.378
- That's not an answer!

09:49.420 --> 09:52.344
Maybe you didn't get a door.
I got a door!

09:54.690 --> 09:56.886
= Our connection
is deeper than ever, now.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.857
The more you practise
our magic, the stronger I get.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.959
Look, I know you don't
wanna believe it,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.335
but we do less damage
down there.

10:08.370 --> 10:11.032
Look, maybe you can
pretty it up again, OK?

10:11.070 --> 10:13.209
How about a villa in Tuscany?

10:13.240 --> 10:15.402
We can make gnocchi.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.272
- I'm not going back
to that hole.

10:17.310 --> 10:20.974
Screw you, and screw your book!

10:21.020 --> 10:24.388
(Screaming, crying)

10:24.420 --> 10:27.117
- Sally!
- Aaah!

10:33.930 --> 10:36.353
(Voices whispering)

10:40.400 --> 10:42.391
(Whooshing, Sally gasps)

10:43.410 --> 10:45.401
(Panting)

10:51.210 --> 10:53.019
What did I do?

10:57.020 --> 10:58.886
(Voices whispering)

10:59.920 --> 11:01.911
(Horns honking)

11:03.030 --> 11:04.680
(Kenny sighing)

11:04.730 --> 11:06.789
- (Kenny): I know
what you're thinking.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.958
- What, that you're gonna
score us some crack?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.389
'Cause it doesn't have
the same effect on us, Kenny.

11:11.430 --> 11:14.138
- No, no, I mean, this place.
It's unassuming, right?

11:14.170 --> 11:16.810
Exclusive?
- Exclusive?

11:16.840 --> 11:21.038
- Boston's newest and finest
live-blood venue.

11:25.950 --> 11:28.419
So... What do you think?

11:28.450 --> 11:31.488
Tonight is the grand opening.
It's pretty awesome, isn't it?

11:31.520 --> 11:33.716
- Yeah, nice.
- Yeah. Thank you.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.114
Hey, gorgeous.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.356
You know, the vampires
who came after the virus,

11:37.390 --> 11:39.950
they do not wanna go to
some Stonehenge-inspired

11:40.000 --> 11:41.297
Buffalo-Bill torture club.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.219
And if they do,
that is creepy.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.726
I don't want them here.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.465
And you know me,
I love horror.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.036
Oh, hey, check this out.

11:48.070 --> 11:50.129
The vamp who did this, prodigy.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.865
She mixed the blood
with a polymer

11:51.910 --> 11:53.036
to stop it
from oxidizing.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.174
She calls it B Positive.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.508
You get it? B Positive?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.973
- What's up, Mr. Bishop?
- Hey, Sarah.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.842
- Yeah... You got a lot
to be positive about.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.380
Kenny...

12:04.420 --> 12:06.047
How did you pull this off?

12:06.090 --> 12:08.513
The club, getting
the vampires in line...

12:08.560 --> 12:10.983
- Well, I mean, I don't
wanna brag or anything,

12:11.030 --> 12:12.156
but after the virus,

12:12.190 --> 12:13.954
there was a big
vacuum in leadership.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.525
I stepped in.
You know how it works.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.460
- You killed your way
to the top?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.470
- Turns out, someone like me
can be a pretty smart fighter.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.800
I learned some tricks without
anyone to teach me. No offense.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.729
- Of course.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.939
- Where's Donna now?
- I don't know.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.517
Back in her hole?
I used the book to call her up.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.042
When I destroyed it,
it sent her back.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.209
- All this happened when I was
out getting more wallpaper.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.911
- Yes! You were gone forever!

12:40.960 --> 12:42.416
(Sighs)

12:42.460 --> 12:44.519
Nora, the spells,

12:44.560 --> 12:46.858
they're burnt into me.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.049
- What?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.922
- I remember them. All.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.268
It's like they're
a part of me now.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.838
- So you know the whole book?
By heart?

12:56.870 --> 12:58.360
- Centuries...

12:58.410 --> 13:02.529
I don't know, millenniums --
millennia -- of spells.

13:02.580 --> 13:06.539
- You said Donna
tricked you. How?

13:06.580 --> 13:09.470
- She made me think
I was calling up my door.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.488
- You can do that?

13:11.520 --> 13:14.217
- Well, she says that I can't,
but I don't believe her.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.012
- Wait...

13:17.360 --> 13:19.488
Would you do that?

13:19.530 --> 13:21.919
- I had to try.

13:21.960 --> 13:26.500
Anyways, there's not
a spell in the book for it.

13:26.530 --> 13:29.568
Nora, I can't
stay here for eternity.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.480
You and Josh, you guys
are gonna move away soon, yeah?

13:33.510 --> 13:37.344
And Aidan, we never completely
know what he's gonna do.

13:37.380 --> 13:40.475
It's not like he lives
a risk-free lifestyle.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.318
- None of us do.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.886
- And, in a hundred years,

13:43.920 --> 13:45.911
when the house
falls down, I'm what?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.281
What am I?

13:47.320 --> 13:51.257
I'm a homeless ghost wandering
the streets of Boston,

13:51.290 --> 13:55.500
waiting for global warming
or a super virus to liquefy us?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.897
- Now you're just
spinning out.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.068
I'm not gonna
tell you what to do,

14:02.100 --> 14:04.899
mostly because I know you,
and I know you're just gonna do

14:04.940 --> 14:06.203
whatever you want anyway.

14:07.310 --> 14:09.039
(Chuckles)

14:09.080 --> 14:12.448
But there could be
serious blowback.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.074
- Do you think that
calling up my door

14:15.120 --> 14:18.090
is gonna poison my soul?

14:18.120 --> 14:21.556
Is it gonna turn me
into this evil necromancer?

14:21.590 --> 14:24.150
- When you say that,
all I can picture is

14:24.190 --> 14:26.921
a guy with a Merlin beard
and a pointy hat.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.423
(Nora sighs)

14:30.470 --> 14:33.531
I think we choose what we are.

14:37.410 --> 14:41.108
You can't be corrupted unless
you wanna be corrupted.

14:59.390 --> 15:00.528
- I'm sorry.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.268
I didn't mean to
stare. I'm sorry.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.120
- It's kind of hard not to.

15:06.430 --> 15:09.263
- I always admired you,
you know?

15:11.210 --> 15:13.133
You got out.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.899
I never did.

15:17.510 --> 15:19.274
- You would've, Sally...

15:20.750 --> 15:23.117
if you'd had more time.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.514
Who knows...

15:26.550 --> 15:29.053
With all those
spells inside of you...

15:30.660 --> 15:34.051
you could turn out to be
the strongest of us all.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.359
(Siren wailing)

15:45.410 --> 15:47.105
- Ace work, man.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.234
You were a monster in there!
- Thanks.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.203
- Hey, I heard about
your mom. Is she OK?

15:51.250 --> 15:54.015
You know, if you ever need
a rec, my dad's an oncologist.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.439
He's up on all the trials,
knows all the best guys...

15:56.480 --> 15:58.482
(Telephone ringing,
woman speaking over PA)

15:58.520 --> 16:00.659
Josh...

16:00.690 --> 16:04.058
- Yeah, uh, I'm sorry, uh...

16:04.090 --> 16:06.354
Could you just re-say
what you just said?

16:06.390 --> 16:09.325
- Have you been sharing
your mom's marijuana card?

16:09.360 --> 16:11.624
- Is that your aftershave?

16:11.670 --> 16:14.992
- Are you serious?
- I'm having an allergy attack.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.462
Ragweed's super high today.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.746
(Siren wailing in distance)

16:38.160 --> 16:40.800
- How are you gonna move
that much product here?

16:40.830 --> 16:43.299
- Well, here, we have
a no-judgment policy,

16:43.330 --> 16:45.765
so all dietary persuasions
are welcomed.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.360
Do you want me to
warm one up for you?

16:48.400 --> 16:51.199
- No. Save it for tonight,
for your paying customers.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.210
- Are you always
this hard to impress?

16:54.240 --> 16:57.449
- I'm just waiting
for the ask, Kenny.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.074
I mean, the grand tour,
blood offerings,

17:00.120 --> 17:02.646
and you have the same
manic vibe that you had

17:02.680 --> 17:06.138
when you were trying to
convince me to turn you. So...

17:06.190 --> 17:08.318
- Well, you basically
threw the deformed baby

17:08.359 --> 17:10.249
in the dumpster and ran.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.260
You're the one who's suspicious?
- You almost killed Nora.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.826
We had to give her
a transfusion, or she'd be dead.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.761
- I was starving!
I was starving.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.269
What is she to you,
anyways? I'm your blood!

17:21.300 --> 17:23.268
- You're my blood,
and they're my friends.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.539
You were in their house.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.060
- That's why I brought

17:26.109 --> 17:27.305
you here today.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.434
To show you I'm not
a monster anymore.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.403
(Sighs)

17:33.580 --> 17:35.810
Kenny, what you've
accomplished...

17:35.850 --> 17:37.284
(Scoffs)

17:37.320 --> 17:39.311
It's something else.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.284
Even Bishop would be proud.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.122
- You and Bishop ran this town.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.494
We can do that too.
The two of us. Father and son.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.794
We can rebuild Boston,
post-apocalypse.

17:50.830 --> 17:52.491
- Kenny--
- Think about it.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.465
- I've already run Boston
with Bishop and with Mother.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.309
I'm not doing that.
- Come on.

17:57.340 --> 17:59.468
You're not gonna
consider it at all?

17:59.510 --> 18:01.103
- Here's a hot tip.

18:01.140 --> 18:04.576
All that leadership ever comes
down to is kill or be killed.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.772
- No! No, no, no.
It's more than that.

18:06.810 --> 18:09.518
You have the opportunity to
shape a future generation.

18:09.550 --> 18:10.813
Convert them, if you want.

18:10.850 --> 18:14.809
Everybody nowadays is just
trying to eat sustainably.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.487
Why can't we do that?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.227
Together?

18:18.260 --> 18:21.127
- I honestly don't know
whether to wish you luck or not.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.696
- Oh, come on.
- I don't.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.289
- Aidan... Really?

18:24.330 --> 18:27.334
What, so you're
just gonna leave?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.334
(Sighs)

18:31.370 --> 18:32.701
Yeah.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.800
(Josh grunting)

19:12.380 --> 19:15.213
(Panting)

19:20.660 --> 19:23.721
Were you?
You've been gone over an hour.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.728
- I lost track of time.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.649
- Dr. 12-year-old
is looking for you.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.828
(Man talking, indistinct,
child laughing)

19:33.900 --> 19:37.609
(Woman speaking foreign
language, machines beeping)

19:37.640 --> 19:41.270
(Men talking, indistinct)

19:44.810 --> 19:47.279
(Grunts)

19:47.320 --> 19:48.742
- (Man): Hey!

19:50.420 --> 19:53.958
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Josh! Josh!

19:53.990 --> 19:57.221
Look, I don't know what
the hell is up with you, man,

19:57.260 --> 19:58.819
but something
IS very, very wrong.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.192
Look, you need to go.
Go, now!

20:08.570 --> 20:10.937
- Oh! Hey!
- Hey.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.563
- Are you home for tea?

20:12.610 --> 20:14.806
- Uh, I don't wanna
talk about it.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.378
I'm going for a run.
- Again?

20:18.410 --> 20:21.539
You're gonna be ready for
the marathon this year.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.845
It's the only thing that helps.
- Helps what? Hey!

20:24.890 --> 20:26.415
Josh, what...

20:26.450 --> 20:28.487
What's going on?

20:29.760 --> 20:31.455
- I just gotta go.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.596
(Sighs)

20:35.630 --> 20:38.725
- I'm not even gonna pretend
I wasn't eavesdropping.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.866
- I'm not even gonna pretend
I know what to do.

20:43.910 --> 20:48.404
- You're giving him
space and time,

20:48.440 --> 20:51.546
and a kicking new bedroom.

20:51.580 --> 20:54.311
And that's all you can do.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.611
- I actually thought
redecorating

20:57.650 --> 20:58.879
would make a difference.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.617
Is that crazy?

21:01.660 --> 21:04.960
I figured, if we can't
move right now,

21:04.990 --> 21:09.894
at least I could make this look
like a real home, finally.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.467
Make it look like a place

21:12.500 --> 21:14.594
where a happy,
married couple lives.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.769
- Yeah, and that's what
newlyweds are supposed to do.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.576
They're supposed to nest,
and bone 24/7.

21:21.610 --> 21:22.736
(Laughs)

21:22.780 --> 21:24.441
- Now I feel even worse.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.039
- (Laughing): Sorry.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.987
- Josh thinks I don't see it.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.725
But the wolf is there.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.421
Just under his skin.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.925
- Tcatchit
in his eyes sometimes.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.735
For a second. Less.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.732
It's a wolf looking back at me.

21:53.540 --> 21:55.736
<i>** I was happy as a child</i>

21:55.780 --> 21:58.044
* Couldn't want for any more

21:58.080 --> 22:00.048
* Was in love...

22:00.080 --> 22:02.811
- I don't know
what to do about Josh.

22:02.850 --> 22:05.740
But why don't you let me
do something for you?

22:05.790 --> 22:07.610
- Can you snap your fingers

22:07.660 --> 22:10.357
and finish this room
like Mary Poppins?

22:10.390 --> 22:12.654
- I can take it away, Nora.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.497
I can heal you.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.105
- (Kenny):
I'm leaving today, OK?

22:25.140 --> 22:27.029
So, what's it gonna be?

22:27.070 --> 22:28.674
** You've got a lot to give

22:28.710 --> 22:31.680
* I've got a lot to take

22:31.710 --> 22:35.578
- OK, great. We don't have
a lot of time. Come on!

22:35.620 --> 22:38.783
* Your eyes should stir
a thousand stars *

22:38.820 --> 22:41.414
* When roses bloom,
majestic flowers *

22:41.460 --> 22:43.519
(Chuckling)

22:43.560 --> 22:44.925
* Nothing ever grows

22:44.960 --> 22:48.658
* Nothing ever grows *

22:51.000 --> 22:53.992
(Kenny inhaling deeply)

22:54.040 --> 22:56.691
- You smell like bubblegum.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.606
And girl.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.801
(Giggles)

22:59.840 --> 23:01.001
(Sighs)

23:01.040 --> 23:02.929
I don't know how
you guys do it.

23:02.980 --> 23:07.850
Day after day, keeping up
with this--this appearance.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.019
And the energy!

23:11.120 --> 23:12.610
It's exhausting.

23:12.650 --> 23:15.881
- Just kick back, Mr. Fisher.

23:17.460 --> 23:19.519
Open up a warm one.

23:20.660 --> 23:24.619
- Yeah. Wash the day away.

23:29.870 --> 23:31.599
(Screams)

23:32.770 --> 23:34.579
- It's cool.

23:34.610 --> 23:36.704
Shhh!

23:36.740 --> 23:39.903
After this,
all you're gonna remember

23:39.950 --> 23:42.476
is asking me for
my Sandman comics.

23:43.650 --> 23:44.879
All right?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.555
- What? What do you want?

24:21.590 --> 24:24.150
- Your hygiene could
use some attention, Josh.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.700
We could smell that stink
for half a mile.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.698
- You know me?

24:31.730 --> 24:33.596
- More like "knew" you.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.194
(Both growling)

24:40.110 --> 24:42.579
(All grunting)

24:49.550 --> 24:52.247
(Josh roaring)

24:52.290 --> 24:54.156
- What the hell?

25:07.270 --> 25:08.999
(Footsteps approaching)

25:09.040 --> 25:10.530
- Josh!

25:10.570 --> 25:12.629
Josh, are you all right?

25:14.210 --> 25:15.678
- I couldn't go home.

25:15.710 --> 25:17.599
I didn't want Nora to see me.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.972
- Josh, the vampires, did you
ever run across them before?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.772
Did you get any names?
- No.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.918
No. They knew me, though.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.081
They were stalking me.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.919
- They attacked you,
but they let you go?

25:30.960 --> 25:33.054
- They tried to kill me.

25:34.660 --> 25:38.119
Then, when I fought, I...

25:40.070 --> 25:41.265
turned.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.189
- What?

25:43.240 --> 25:46.232
- Only this was worse.

25:46.270 --> 25:48.170
It was my fangs and my claws--

25:48.210 --> 25:51.703
- Josh, that doesn't--
- It started going to my arms.

25:51.750 --> 25:55.675
- I've never heard of a wolf
who was able to turn at will.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.142
Not even purebreds.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.550
- I don't know
what's happening to me.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.879
- All right, look...

26:06.930 --> 26:09.126
Let's just go
get you cleaned up, OK?

26:09.160 --> 26:10.559
Come on.

26:13.870 --> 26:15.292
- I can't go home.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.109
- OK. OK.

26:21.410 --> 26:25.278
- Who knew Chinatown was
one-stop shopping for witches.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.278
They had bear gallbladder.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.642
Sliced or powdered.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.944
- I can't stop thinking
about those pork buns.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.118
I could seriously
have murdered a four-pack.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.928
- How did I get here?

26:37.960 --> 26:40.156
I'm a registered nurse,
and now I'm sidekicking

26:40.190 --> 26:42.022
as a magician's assistant.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.027
(Laughs)

26:43.060 --> 26:45.267
- OK. I think that's good.

26:45.300 --> 26:47.359
Yeah. So...

26:48.700 --> 26:50.395
massage it on the scar,

26:50.440 --> 26:53.876
and then wrap it
in the bandages.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.672
(Sighs)

26:57.710 --> 26:59.940
- Part of me thinks
this can't work.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.745
And the other part...

27:04.190 --> 27:06.147
Is this gonna have
side effects

27:06.190 --> 27:08.386
that I can't even
begin to imagine?

27:08.420 --> 27:10.923
- No, Nora. We didn't kill
anybody to get this.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.952
Honestly, this is like the witch
equivalent of zit removal.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.355
Hey, I don't wanna
pressure you.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.925
Are we moving too fast?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.428
(Both laughing)

27:20.470 --> 27:25.704
- I'm married now,
to a man that I love.

27:27.070 --> 27:29.801
It shouldn't matter.
Josh doesn't care.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.376
- Yeah.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.742
- But even when we're
just lying in bed,

27:33.780 --> 27:37.273
I can feel it against him.

27:39.050 --> 27:41.052
It's always there.

27:41.090 --> 27:45.027
It's a reminder
of Will, you know?

27:45.060 --> 27:46.380
And what he did to me.

27:46.430 --> 27:48.751
Third-degree burns,

27:48.800 --> 27:50.723
5 skin grafts...

27:51.800 --> 27:53.791
and still...

28:12.020 --> 28:13.340
Do you think that's enough?

28:13.390 --> 28:15.085
- Yeah, that looks good.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.467
(Sighs)

28:28.500 --> 28:30.093
- OK.
- Wait!

28:30.140 --> 28:31.904
Do you know the spell
word for word,

28:31.940 --> 28:34.034
or are you just
remembering the gist of it?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.071
'Cause the last
thing that I need

28:36.110 --> 28:38.408
is some Gollum creature
waving from my abs.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.340
- I know the spell.
- OK.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.310
(Exhales sharply)

28:45.350 --> 28:48.718
(Speaking foreign language)

28:57.830 --> 28:59.127
(Whooshing)

28:59.170 --> 29:01.229
- Sally?

29:05.070 --> 29:07.129
There she goes again.

29:09.010 --> 29:11.900
(* Rock )

29:11.950 --> 29:14.044
(Man whooping nearby)

29:14.080 --> 29:16.469
- Here I go again.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.984
Oh my God!

29:25.030 --> 29:27.795
The house! The '70s!

29:27.830 --> 29:30.424
So sad I didn't know thee!

29:31.500 --> 29:33.093
- (Girl): Lil' smokie?

29:33.130 --> 29:35.440
Does anybody want
a little smokie?

29:35.470 --> 29:37.029
Lil' smokie?

29:41.010 --> 29:42.569
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

29:42.610 --> 29:44.499
Lil' smokie?

29:46.580 --> 29:48.014
Lil' smokie?

29:49.180 --> 29:51.080
(Crying): No! Let me go!

29:51.120 --> 29:54.010
- (Women chanting): The blood of
the child revives us!

29:54.060 --> 29:55.289
(Sally screams)

29:56.390 --> 29:59.030
- Hey! Hey!

29:59.060 --> 30:00.824
Where are your parents?

30:00.860 --> 30:03.591
- Lil' smokie?
- What's your name?

30:03.630 --> 30:05.189
Hey, I'm right here!

30:06.930 --> 30:09.331
What happened to you
in our house?

30:10.870 --> 30:12.269
- Kenny...

30:13.510 --> 30:15.376
Kenny...

30:15.410 --> 30:17.947
Uh...

30:17.980 --> 30:20.950
Look, I think I know
where we're headed, and...

30:20.980 --> 30:22.379
- Yeah, sure.

30:22.420 --> 30:26.015
What better place than the woods
where you dumped me, right?

30:26.050 --> 30:27.120
(Aidan sighs)

30:27.150 --> 30:28.857
- Look...

30:28.890 --> 30:31.928
Josh was attacked by
a couple of vampires last night.

30:33.930 --> 30:36.092
Do you know anything
about that?

30:38.030 --> 30:40.294
- I sent them to kill him.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.312
- What, like he sent you
to kill me?

31:00.350 --> 31:02.455
- How did you know about that?

31:02.490 --> 31:04.629
- He flipped out
when you wanted to turn me.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.150
I almost ate his girlfriend.

31:06.190 --> 31:08.022
- OK, you know what?

31:08.060 --> 31:11.166
If this is a Shakespearean
tragedy, let's skip to the end.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.895
You say you can fight?

31:12.930 --> 31:14.568
Prove it.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.295
Come on.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.432
Come on.

31:19.470 --> 31:23.429
Kill me for abandoning you.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.539
But you're gonna
leave my friends alone.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.086
Pick it up.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.986
- I don't wanna kill you.

31:38.690 --> 31:42.251
- I am sick and tired of trading
guilt trips with you, Kenny.

31:43.430 --> 31:46.320
So I'm gonna say this
one more time.

31:46.370 --> 31:48.099
PICK IT UP!

31:49.440 --> 31:52.466
- You think I'm afraid of dying?

31:59.710 --> 32:02.941
You know, I was gonna leave
that cell on my 18th birthday,

32:02.980 --> 32:05.950
get sick and die
in my own piss and vomit.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.958
- Look at me!

32:07.990 --> 32:12.655
- I don't have any memories
of touching my dad's hand,

32:12.690 --> 32:14.624
or what my mom smells like.

32:14.660 --> 32:17.027
You told me that
a relationship

32:17.060 --> 32:20.223
between a vampire
and his maker was special.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.295
- Yes, I did!
- You said that it was magical!

32:22.340 --> 32:24.229
And that's the reason
that I came back.

32:24.270 --> 32:27.137
- There has to be more
than just blood between us!

32:30.280 --> 32:32.408
- You wanna know why
I went after Josh?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.145
- Yes. I do.

32:34.180 --> 32:37.013
- Because I thought that
if he was out of the picture...

32:38.550 --> 32:41.383
- You thought what?
You thought I would let you in?

32:41.420 --> 32:42.558
- Yeah.

32:42.590 --> 32:44.251
- Oh God!

32:44.290 --> 32:45.724
- I'm not gonna touch them.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.649
I promise. Nora, Josh,
anybody you want.

32:47.690 --> 32:49.658
I--I'm gonna stay away
from them, I swear.

32:49.700 --> 32:52.670
- How am I supposed to
believe this?

33:04.050 --> 33:06.610
What is this?
What did you do?

33:06.650 --> 33:09.676
You can change the way
that you look?

33:09.720 --> 33:12.314
- I can't control
what I look like.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.455
I can control what people see.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.387
I can compel vampires.

33:19.490 --> 33:23.028
- Wait, you can compel me?
- Yeah.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.427
- Without saying a word?
- It's draining.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.325
I mean, I gotta feed
4 or 5 times

33:27.370 --> 33:30.192
what a normal vampire does,
just to keep it up.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.562
- Well then, why didn't you just
compel me to join you,

33:33.610 --> 33:35.704
to forget that
you'd attacked Josh?

33:35.740 --> 33:38.209
- If it's not real,
what's the point?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.574
(Sighs)

33:49.490 --> 33:52.460
- You don't have to put on
a mask for me, Kenny.

33:52.490 --> 33:54.629
- It helps me deal with myself.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.389
(Cell ringing)

33:58.230 --> 33:59.629
Kenny.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.063
OK. We gotta go.

34:10.510 --> 34:12.239
- (Nora): Never again.

34:12.280 --> 34:16.614
Promise me, you're not gonna go
Marathon Man at night anymore.

34:16.650 --> 34:19.290
- It's not the vampires
that I'm worried about.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.485
The wolf...

34:24.330 --> 34:26.685
The wolf can come out
whenever it wants.

34:26.730 --> 34:30.098
- He came out because he thought
he was going to be killed.

34:30.130 --> 34:32.098
He thought you were
going to be killed.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.268
Thank God he did!

34:33.300 --> 34:35.530
- I thought he was gonna
take over completely!

34:35.570 --> 34:37.436
Even after the vampires ran off,

34:37.469 --> 34:40.235
it was everything I could do

34:40.270 --> 34:45.242
to just cling onto
a sense of me, of myself.

34:48.550 --> 34:52.088
The thing I can't
stop thinking about...

34:54.159 --> 34:57.380
is the fact that
I... I liked it.

34:57.420 --> 35:01.220
I felt powerful.
I felt strong.

35:02.630 --> 35:04.189
- You didn't like it.

35:04.230 --> 35:06.267
You were just
acting on instinct.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.735
- That's right, but what if
that instinct takes over?

35:08.770 --> 35:10.260
What if I can't get back?

35:10.300 --> 35:13.759
- No. You're still you, OK?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.772
- I'm so sorry.

35:23.920 --> 35:26.412
- You've nothing to
be sorry about.

35:26.450 --> 35:28.680
This isn't your fault.

35:28.720 --> 35:32.281
The way we brought you back...
Sally said she wasn't finished.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.729
- But I am back.

35:36.330 --> 35:38.196
I am what I am.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.710
Don't drag Sally into this,
please. Don't even...

35:44.740 --> 35:47.630
- I'm not.
- ...mention it to her.

35:47.670 --> 35:50.879
- I'm just asking you
not to put it all on you.

35:52.210 --> 35:54.542
We're gonna figure this out.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.342
I love you.

36:00.390 --> 36:04.224
And you are the most
self-controlling person I know.

36:05.290 --> 36:07.281
Don't take that the wrong way.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.457
You will learn
how to rein in this wolf.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.662
You're stronger than he is.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.759
He's alone.

36:15.800 --> 36:17.461
And you have me.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.538
And you have Sally,
and you have Aidan.

36:20.570 --> 36:22.607
We'll cover shifts for you.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.540
We'll track what triggers you.

36:24.580 --> 36:28.448
And we will keep the wolf
to his one night a month.

36:29.450 --> 36:30.940
Whatever it takes.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.634
- Are you kidding me?
Back off.

36:48.670 --> 36:50.798
Look, I haven't
reported you, but I will.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.229
- You don't have to
worry about me anymore.

36:54.310 --> 36:55.630
I quit.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.500
- Hey...

36:57.540 --> 36:59.975
What is going on with you?

37:00.010 --> 37:01.739
Do you need help?

37:02.950 --> 37:04.782
- I'm sorry if hurt you.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.794
- (Kenny): Holy mother!

37:18.830 --> 37:21.663
Sarah? Sarah?

37:24.440 --> 37:26.704
- (Aidan): Oh my God!

37:26.740 --> 37:28.879
What happened here?

37:28.910 --> 37:30.969
No, no, no!
Don't touch her!

37:42.390 --> 37:43.880
Who would try
something like that?

37:43.920 --> 37:46.480
- Could this be anyone
you crossed on the way up?

37:46.530 --> 37:47.782
- No. I got rid of all them.

37:47.830 --> 37:48.922
You think it was wolves?

37:48.960 --> 37:51.292
- They wouldn't try this
without a full moon.

37:51.330 --> 37:53.799
The last time I saw carnage
like this was turf wars.

37:53.830 --> 37:55.696
But vampires,
we don't do that anymore.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.937
Not even Bishop would make this
kind of statement, till the end.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.904
- Do you think it was
a hit out on me?

38:00.940 --> 38:03.534
Or a "Luca Brasi sleeps
with the fishes" message?

38:03.580 --> 38:05.503
- Ease up, Godfather.
- OK, then what?

38:05.550 --> 38:06.699
- Van Helsing?
- Kenny...

38:06.750 --> 38:08.946
- Well, at least I know
how we can find out.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.952
(Crying)

38:20.890 --> 38:23.791
- Nora? It didn't work?

38:23.830 --> 38:25.889
- Sally...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.859
Tell me I'm not hallucinating.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.334
(Both laughing)

38:32.370 --> 38:33.860
- It's gone!

38:33.910 --> 38:35.332
- Thank you!

38:41.920 --> 38:43.877
You're not
regretting doing it?

38:43.920 --> 38:45.410
- No! God no!

38:45.450 --> 38:47.544
No, I'm so happy for you!

38:47.590 --> 38:49.581
It's just...

38:51.930 --> 38:56.891
What happens after,
where I go...

38:56.930 --> 38:59.763
I mean, I guess that's
just the price of doing magic.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.098
Seeing things that I can't stop.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.405
Things that I don't wanna know.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.376
I saw the little girl again.

39:08.410 --> 39:10.037
The one who gets murdered.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.775
- Sally...

39:11.810 --> 39:14.108
You don't have to
do any more magic.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.879
Not for me,
not for any of us.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.479
Not if it's hurting you.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.511
(Paper rustling)

39:19.550 --> 39:21.552
What is it?

39:30.560 --> 39:33.029
Oh! Really?

39:34.700 --> 39:37.067
(Gasps)

39:37.100 --> 39:41.059
- OK, it's not that big a deal.
- Do you not see that?

39:41.110 --> 39:44.808
- Well, we'll have to sandblast
to get the glue off.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.670
(Sighs)

39:46.710 --> 39:48.940
- It's the little
girl who dies.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.788
It says: "Don't leave me."

39:52.820 --> 39:55.653
- What? Is she here?

39:55.690 --> 39:57.988
- No. She's sending
me a message.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.791
Time slipping,
it's not a punishment.

40:02.830 --> 40:05.128
I'm supposed to help her.

40:06.830 --> 40:09.834
- You put cameras in?

40:09.870 --> 40:13.431
So you can, what, tweet video of
vampires sucking people dry?

40:13.470 --> 40:15.199
What the hell
are you kids thinking?

40:15.240 --> 40:16.833
- I'm not a moron,
all right?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.850
Only I know about the cameras.
I installed them myself.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.542
Plus the files overwrite
themselves every 12 hours.

40:26.550 --> 40:31.659
(People talking,
screaming)

40:31.690 --> 40:33.829
Oh! Damn!

40:41.230 --> 40:46.031
(* Man singing rock,
lyrics indistinct *)

40:55.250 --> 40:56.843
Who the hell is that?

41:00.890 --> 41:02.756
