Mnnh-choo.

00:40.154 --> 00:41.462
Mm.

00:43.724 --> 00:45.397
What?!

00:45.459 --> 00:47.700
Jake, I told you to stop staring
at me right at the time

00:47.761 --> 00:49.035
when I wake up.

00:49.096 --> 00:51.406
I'm staring because I
can't move my head!

00:52.466 --> 00:53.672
No, really, I can't move.

00:53.734 --> 00:54.838
I can't move, either!

00:54.902 --> 00:55.903
What's happening?!

00:57.171 --> 00:58.206
What? What is that?

00:58.272 --> 00:59.449
- Hey, who is that?
- Who goes there?

00:59.473 --> 01:01.180
Jake, use your
peripheral vision!

01:02.610 --> 01:05.453
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

01:07.314 --> 01:08.314
Ice King!

01:09.450 --> 01:10.451
I shouldn't be laughing.

01:10.517 --> 01:11.587
I'm sorry.

01:11.652 --> 01:13.598
Oh, I know... I'll
do the opposite.

01:13.654 --> 01:15.895
Oh, boohoo!

01:17.124 --> 01:18.831
Oh, this is weird.

01:18.893 --> 01:20.036
What did you do
to us, Ice King?!

01:20.060 --> 01:21.266
Whoa, whoa.

01:21.328 --> 01:24.366
I didn't "do" anything
to you, okay?

01:24.431 --> 01:25.910
Come on, guys. I'm your friend.

01:25.966 --> 01:27.604
So why can't we move?!

01:27.668 --> 01:30.706
Ooh! Because I froze
you, with this.

01:30.771 --> 01:32.648
"Freezing Potion A"?

01:32.706 --> 01:34.549
I sprayed it on you
while you slept.

01:34.608 --> 01:35.916
Wenk! Wenk!

01:35.976 --> 01:37.887
No! Gunter, no!

01:37.945 --> 01:40.892
This one likes to break
bottles, don't you?

01:40.948 --> 01:42.291
Tuckity tuck.

01:43.884 --> 01:45.830
Let's move to the living room.

01:50.391 --> 01:51.635
Why are you doing
this, Ice King?

01:51.659 --> 01:53.138
Why'?

01:53.193 --> 01:58.541
Well, because I love you guys,
but you don't love me, do you?

01:58.599 --> 02:00.704
You've tried to kill
us like four times.

02:00.768 --> 02:03.942
I only try to kill you 'cause
you're princess-blockin'

02:04.004 --> 02:05.347
me all the time!

02:07.341 --> 02:11.414
Anyway, now that you're frozen,
we can bond and stuff,

02:11.478 --> 02:15.949
and the sooner we do, the sooner
I can spray you with this.

02:16.016 --> 02:17.586
"Unfreezing Potion A"?

02:17.651 --> 02:20.928
Uh, I underlined the "Un..."
so I wouldn't mix 'em up.

02:20.988 --> 02:23.025
Just unfreeze us now, man.

02:23.090 --> 02:24.728
Yeah, 'cause we're
already friends.

02:24.792 --> 02:25.668
We are'?

02:25.726 --> 02:26.568
Mm-hmm.

02:26.627 --> 02:28.004
What's my favorite color?

02:28.062 --> 02:28.972
Um.

02:29.029 --> 02:30.133
Yellow? Orange?

02:30.197 --> 02:31.198
Ohh, uh.

02:31.265 --> 02:32.335
Lavender, lavender, yeah!

02:32.399 --> 02:33.241
Uh, Rainbow?

02:33.300 --> 02:34.973
You don't love me.

02:36.904 --> 02:39.043
I know a lot about you guys.

02:39.106 --> 02:41.552
Jake, you don't put ice in
your drink because you have

02:41.608 --> 02:42.951
sensitive teeth.

02:43.010 --> 02:44.045
What?

02:44.111 --> 02:47.251
And, Finn, your favorite
food is meatloaf.

02:47.314 --> 02:48.657
How did you...

02:48.716 --> 02:51.754
And, Jake, sometimes
you don't cry because

02:51.819 --> 02:54.095
you're afraid of real emotion.

02:54.154 --> 02:55.633
It's okay.

02:55.689 --> 02:57.066
Let it out.

02:57.124 --> 02:58.831
You don't love me.

02:58.892 --> 03:00.428
Wenk! Wenk, vvenk!

03:00.494 --> 03:02.440
Wenk! Wenk!

03:02.496 --> 03:03.941
Bad penguin!

03:03.998 --> 03:05.306
Wenk.

03:08.736 --> 03:11.239
You lock your bottles?

03:12.206 --> 03:13.206
In this economy?

03:15.042 --> 03:16.851
Well, I'm gonna go
make some lemonade.

03:16.910 --> 03:18.787
Don't touch my lemons, Ice King!

03:18.846 --> 03:20.553
Ice King!

03:20.614 --> 03:21.957
Jake, look!

03:23.150 --> 03:24.356
Gunter! No, Gunter! No!

03:24.418 --> 03:25.829
No, Gunter! No!

03:25.886 --> 03:26.728
Wenk.

03:26.787 --> 03:27.629
No, Gunter! No!

03:27.688 --> 03:28.928
Aah, aah!

03:28.989 --> 03:30.593
Aaah! Gunter, stop!

03:30.657 --> 03:31.601
Wenk, wenk!

03:31.658 --> 03:33.035
What are we gonna do?!

03:33.093 --> 03:36.836
When someone loses one sense,
their other senses are enhanced,

03:36.897 --> 03:38.937
like a blind man who can
smell and hear really well.

03:38.966 --> 03:41.845
I'm gonna try using my
now-enhanced brain sense to make

03:41.902 --> 03:44.542
contact with an astral
beast who will help us.

03:44.605 --> 03:45.879
What?

03:51.478 --> 03:52.388
Whee!

03:52.446 --> 03:54.016
Whee!

03:54.081 --> 03:56.960
Astral beast, come to me!

03:57.017 --> 04:00.226
Come to me, astral beast.

04:00.287 --> 04:02.130
I've got lemonade!

04:04.591 --> 04:06.696
You want some, Jake?

04:09.229 --> 04:10.299
Huh?

04:10.364 --> 04:11.934
Gunter!

04:11.999 --> 04:12.999
No, Gunter!

04:13.033 --> 04:14.910
No bottles! Look at me!

04:14.968 --> 04:16.208
Wenk.

04:17.271 --> 04:18.875
What am I gonna do with you?

04:18.939 --> 04:20.680
Oh, you.

04:22.876 --> 04:24.549
You're going to have
to wear a leash.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.921
This should keep you
out of trouble.

04:28.982 --> 04:33.158
Now, our first bonding activity
will be walking in each ether's

04:33.220 --> 04:35.097
shoes, so to speak.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.635
To better understand each
ether's perspectives,

04:37.691 --> 04:39.864
we're going to dress
up like each other.

04:39.927 --> 04:41.463
Me first!

04:57.544 --> 04:59.990
It's Adventure Time!

05:00.047 --> 05:01.754
I'll save you, Princess!

05:01.815 --> 05:03.590
Let's have babies, Princess!

05:03.650 --> 05:06.324
And let's teach them
to be good babies!

05:06.386 --> 05:08.764
Oh, Princess, sure,
I'll kiss you.

05:08.822 --> 05:10.460
I'm a hero.

05:10.524 --> 05:13.437
Hey, Finn, uh, don't you think
it's weird there's two Finns?

05:13.494 --> 05:15.337
Finn? Not talking?

05:15.395 --> 05:18.672
Now I'm gonna dress like Jake.

05:20.834 --> 05:21.904
No!!

05:21.969 --> 05:23.642
No, no, Ho, no, no!

05:23.704 --> 05:25.274
Okay, okay.

05:25.339 --> 05:26.875
We'll bond in another way.

05:28.175 --> 05:31.019
So, I wanted to show you
something telling of my soul.

05:31.078 --> 05:33.183
Wenk. Wenk.

05:33.247 --> 05:35.693
I take artful black-and-white
photographs of my penguirfs

05:35.749 --> 05:37.319
body parts.

05:37.384 --> 05:39.990
Photography is art.

05:40.053 --> 05:42.124
Uh, let's see some art.

05:42.189 --> 05:46.296
Okay, first one... See
how Gunter is staring

05:46.360 --> 05:47.600
into the camera?

05:47.661 --> 05:49.641
He's saying, "Here I am.

05:49.696 --> 05:52.438
Look at me. Accept me."

05:52.499 --> 05:56.140
Okay, second one... This
is a haunting image

05:56.203 --> 05:58.046
of a penguin's flipper.

05:58.105 --> 05:59.482
Look at how it penetrates
the negative space.

05:59.506 --> 06:00.678
I can't take this anymore!

06:00.741 --> 06:02.584
Dang it, Finn, what are
you doing in there?!

06:02.643 --> 06:03.923
Oh, yes, this one is very clear.

06:04.978 --> 06:07.288
Astral beast, where are you?!

06:07.347 --> 06:10.055
You come here now!!

06:10.117 --> 06:11.926
Whee!

06:11.985 --> 06:12.827
Yeah, I've thought
about it a lot.

06:12.886 --> 06:14.422
Ohh.

06:14.488 --> 06:17.332
And having a little gallery
show might be nice...

06:17.391 --> 06:19.064
A little cheese, a little cider.

06:19.126 --> 06:20.730
Could be nice, you know?

06:20.794 --> 06:22.205
Maybe bring a veggie plate.

06:22.262 --> 06:23.104
I think people would
appreciate that.

06:23.163 --> 06:24.163
Key! Gunter! Gunter!

06:24.198 --> 06:25.575
Yup, could be real nice.

06:25.632 --> 06:26.576
Gunter, psst!

06:26.633 --> 06:28.840
Ps-s-s-st! Come here, Gunter!

06:30.737 --> 06:32.512
We-e-e-e-n k!

06:33.974 --> 06:36.318
This next one is very rewarding.

06:38.011 --> 06:38.887
Grab it, Gunter!

06:38.946 --> 06:41.222
Pick it up!

06:41.281 --> 06:45.161
Pick it up!

06:45.219 --> 06:46.061
What are you waiting for?

06:46.119 --> 06:47.723
Just grab it!

06:50.324 --> 06:51.268
Wenk.

06:51.325 --> 06:52.827
Wenk, vvenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk.

06:52.893 --> 06:54.167
Gunter, come back!

06:54.228 --> 06:55.070
Wenk, wenk.

06:55.128 --> 06:57.369
- Gunter!
- Wenk?

06:57.431 --> 06:58.876
You are being naughty, Gunter!

06:58.932 --> 07:00.912
You've interrupted my thing!

07:00.968 --> 07:03.471
Now, you stay right
here and go to sleep!

07:03.537 --> 07:04.537
Sleep!

07:05.439 --> 07:06.281
Wenk. Wenk.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.251
Aww! So cute.

07:08.308 --> 07:09.946
All right, back to art.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.353
Gunter.

07:11.411 --> 07:13.448
Gunter, wake up.

07:13.513 --> 07:17.427
Go... get... the... key.

07:20.420 --> 07:21.763
Consarn it, Gunter!

07:21.822 --> 07:23.529
Okay, time for a break.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.536
Who wants lemonade?

07:27.327 --> 07:29.102
Ooh, don't want to lose this.

07:30.864 --> 07:32.502
Gunter! Jake!

07:32.566 --> 07:36.412
No! You're bonding without me!

07:36.470 --> 07:37.710
Wenk.

07:39.072 --> 07:41.143
It's for your own good, sweetie.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.983
Now, then...

07:45.379 --> 07:47.256
Wait, you're sleeping up here?

07:47.314 --> 07:52.559
Well not before our next
bonding activity...

07:52.619 --> 07:55.065
Late-night gab session.

07:56.590 --> 07:59.730
Do you want to talk about girls?

07:59.793 --> 08:02.501
Do you have a crush on anyone?

08:02.562 --> 08:05.907
Uh, yeah, my girlfriend,
Lady Rainicorn.

08:05.966 --> 08:08.071
Ooohhhhhh!

08:08.135 --> 08:10.240
Don't worry... I
won't tell anyone.

08:11.638 --> 08:13.618
Know who I have a crush on?

08:13.674 --> 08:15.347
Princess Bubblegum.

08:15.409 --> 08:17.047
You don't say.

08:17.110 --> 08:18.418
Oh, I <i>do</i>

08:18.478 --> 08:20.856
I've liked her for
quite some time.

08:20.914 --> 08:22.951
Feels weird to say it out loud.

08:25.719 --> 08:26.891
What?

08:26.953 --> 08:28.990
Ohh, he fell asleep
with his eyes open!

08:29.056 --> 08:30.729
Finn!

08:30.791 --> 08:32.861
Finn, snap out of it!

08:32.926 --> 08:36.304
Astral beast, where are you?!

08:36.363 --> 08:37.671
Show yourself!

08:37.731 --> 08:38.835
Why not?!

08:38.899 --> 08:40.879
Does this dance please
you, astral beast?!

08:40.933 --> 08:42.607
Does this please you?!

08:45.672 --> 08:48.016
This is it!

08:50.677 --> 08:52.247
The astral beast cometh.

08:55.482 --> 08:56.893
Rr-rr-rr rr-rrrr!

08:58.251 --> 08:59.787
Who's hungie?

08:59.853 --> 09:01.457
Jake, you hungie?

09:01.521 --> 09:02.864
I'm hungry.

09:02.923 --> 09:04.334
All right, fair enough.

09:04.391 --> 09:06.894
Well, how about I
make us some omelets?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.201
That sounds pretty
good, actually.

09:09.262 --> 09:11.003
I'm gonna put my foot in it.

09:11.064 --> 09:15.137
Eating a part of me will
bring us closer together.

09:15.202 --> 09:16.909
I'll be inside of you.

09:18.705 --> 09:20.616
Dude, you're back!

09:20.674 --> 09:23.518
Yup. I just got back
from the astral plane.

09:23.577 --> 09:24.954
Where's your astral beast?

09:25.011 --> 09:26.217
It's on its way.

09:26.279 --> 09:27.519
It's gonna be awesome.

09:27.581 --> 09:28.651
What kind of beast?

09:28.715 --> 09:29.887
Well, I'm not sure.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.227
I couldn't see it in
the astral plane.

09:31.251 --> 09:32.457
But I heard it.

09:32.519 --> 09:33.896
It sounded really intense.

09:34.988 --> 09:35.988
Maybe a gorilla?

09:36.023 --> 09:37.331
A gorilla, huh?

09:37.391 --> 09:39.769
Aw, junk!

09:39.826 --> 09:41.100
Did I summon butterflies?!

09:42.763 --> 09:44.367
I'm the worst.

09:44.431 --> 09:46.104
Hey, come on, now.
You're not the worst.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.338
Yeah, I am.

09:47.401 --> 09:48.971
No, you're not...
You're the best.

09:49.035 --> 09:50.207
At being the worst.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.079
Mmnnnhhh!

09:52.139 --> 09:53.550
What are you doing?

09:53.607 --> 09:56.178
I'm using my enhanced brain
sense to tell your astral beast

09:56.243 --> 09:57.813
to slap some sense into you.

09:57.878 --> 09:59.050
Oh. That's cool.

09:59.112 --> 09:59.988
I deserve it.

10:00.047 --> 10:01.617
Mmnnnnhh!

10:01.681 --> 10:04.127
No... you... don't!

10:13.427 --> 10:15.407
Well, I don't want to
use too much foot.

10:15.462 --> 10:18.170
It'll overpower the eggs...
Take away from the omelet.

10:18.231 --> 10:20.006
Huh? Aaah!

10:21.735 --> 10:24.978
Finn and Jake... and a
bunch of butterflies...

10:25.038 --> 10:26.244
and a sword!

10:26.306 --> 10:28.013
Ohm

10:28.075 --> 10:29.850
What do you want from me?

10:29.910 --> 10:31.253
What do we want?

10:31.311 --> 10:34.121
We want you to unfreeze
us, you lunatic!

10:34.181 --> 10:36.092
No, we're not friends yet.

10:36.149 --> 10:37.753
You haven't eaten my omelet.

10:37.818 --> 10:39.695
Aah! Ohh!

10:39.753 --> 10:41.357
Aah! Ohh!

10:41.421 --> 10:43.458
Friends don't eat
each other, Ice King.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.298
That's not how friends work.

10:45.358 --> 10:47.429
Now, unlock this bottle
and unfreeze us!

10:47.494 --> 10:50.441
Ohh! All right.

10:50.497 --> 10:53.341
I don't know how you're doing
this, but it is impressive.

10:55.502 --> 10:57.004
Wait a minute.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.242
Which bottle is 'Eh...

11:00.707 --> 11:02.380
I think they brought
me the wrong bottle.

11:02.442 --> 11:03.978
Gunteï¬s still upstairs.

11:04.044 --> 11:06.456

11:06.513 --> 11:07.787
