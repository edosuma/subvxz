01:28.338 --> 01:30.089
I love Chinatown,

01:30.174 --> 01:33.384
although I wish they'd
stop picking on Tibet Town.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.936
Ooh, it must be Chinese New Year.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.614
People buy them when
they're small and cute.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.115
Then they flush them down the toilet.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.411
Uh, yeah. I'll have the
shark butt with butt sauce.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.872
Bart! Excellent choice, sir.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.795
How is the Feast of Twelve Delights
with Triple Happiness Sauce?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.631
Very disappointing.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.342
Then I'll have the sweet and sour rice.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.885
Oh, very good.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.388
Would you like that with the
fragrant bee bellies or the cat noses?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.057
Neither, thank you.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.809
Is there any way we can enhance

02:22.893 --> 02:25.561
your dining experience
by hurting an animal?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.687
No!

02:28.899 --> 02:30.525
Fortune cookies!

02:32.277 --> 02:36.364
And now to read my fortune.
"Geese can be troublesome. "

02:37.074 --> 02:39.158
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

02:39.243 --> 02:42.870
Oh. Fortune means geese cause problems.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.040
Well, I knew that before I came in here.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.251
A guy outside told me that.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.420
"Every house has a bathroom. "

02:51.588 --> 02:53.840
Oh, these fortunes are terrible.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.299
Is there a problem?

02:55.384 --> 02:57.176
These fortunes are terrible.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.470
They're supposed to predict stuff

02:59.555 --> 03:01.931
and ease you through times
of doubt and sickness.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.016
Well, with all due respect, sir,

03:04.101 --> 03:06.686
I suppose you could come
up with better fortune?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.563
Easy.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.231
Well?

03:10.440 --> 03:13.150
"You will be aroused by
a shampoo commercial. "

03:13.986 --> 03:16.195
That's not bad. Come with me.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.999
It's terrible! What am I doing here?

03:28.083 --> 03:31.335
I should be in New York writing
riddles on Popsicle sticks!

03:31.420 --> 03:33.296
Then I'd be making a difference.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.339
They ruined my best fortune.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.800
I wrote, "Let a frown
be your umbrella. "

03:37.885 --> 03:39.385
They change it to "smile. "

03:39.469 --> 03:42.305
A frown is a much better
umbrella than a smile!

03:44.433 --> 03:47.268
This gentleman here can
write better fortunes

03:47.352 --> 03:49.353
than all of you put together.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.647
Show them. Okay, let's see...

03:52.900 --> 03:55.484
"The price of stamps
will climb ever higher. "

03:55.611 --> 03:57.486
Very profound.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.406
He's like a young me!

04:00.490 --> 04:03.159
Please! Yung Mee was a
hack compared to this guy!

04:03.410 --> 04:04.452
You're hired.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.830
Let's see. "You will invent
a humorous toilet lid. "

04:08.498 --> 04:10.833
"You will find true love on Flag Day. "

04:11.084 --> 04:13.419
"Your store is being robbed, Apu. "

04:13.670 --> 04:15.338
Are you getting all this, Lisa?

04:17.298 --> 04:18.798
I don't know.

04:21.136 --> 04:23.095
"You are a real winner. "

04:24.056 --> 04:27.308
That fortune really nailed
me, and my winning ways.

04:29.561 --> 04:35.107
"You will take a short sea
voyage. " Yarr! I'll enjoy that.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.990
$14 and 10, 11, 12 cents. There you go.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.159
You know, sir, tipping is customary.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.703
Ooh! Me sorry! Me no speaky Chiny!

04:50.457 --> 04:52.833
General Gao, you're a bloodthirsty fool,

04:52.918 --> 04:55.044
but your chicken is delectable.

04:57.506 --> 05:01.300
This cookie feels heavy, as
if there's some paper inside.

05:04.721 --> 05:05.972
Nice job, sir.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.348
That was my thumb.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.310
There seems to be some
sort of communiquÃ©!

05:11.395 --> 05:12.478
It's your fortune, sir.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.646
Capital!

05:13.730 --> 05:18.401
"You will find true love on Flag
Day. " Why, it's Flag Day today.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.654
True love at last!

05:21.738 --> 05:24.156
Well, it's just you and me here, sir.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.783
No time for jokes, Smithers.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.160
Come along. We're going womanizing.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.079
Oh, goody.

05:32.624 --> 05:36.794
So I foreclosed on her
mortgage and took her cats.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.842
Oh, Monty. It's such a
delight to talk to you.

05:42.926 --> 05:46.387
I've gone five minutes without
saying, "Well, I never!"

05:46.471 --> 05:49.765
Excellent. Let me fetch
you another Thomas Collins.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.149
Damn that Pennybags!

05:58.233 --> 06:01.736
Between him and Scrooge McDuck,
all the best ankle is taken!

06:04.448 --> 06:06.991
Perhaps there're some girls in here.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.869
Great heavens!

06:11.163 --> 06:14.165
It's one of those nude
female fire stations!

06:14.249 --> 06:16.959
I'd always be second place to
some kitten stuck in a tree.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.462
Let's go, Smithers. Smithers?

06:26.470 --> 06:29.096
That fortune promised me true love.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.766
This has been the worst Flag Day ever.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.062
That constable is ticketing my car!

06:36.480 --> 06:39.607
I told you we should've
parked next to the curb.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.109
Now, see here, Flatfoot!

06:45.155 --> 06:47.281
My goodness. You're beautiful.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.492
Oh, thanks, but I still
gotta give you the ticket.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.662
Of course you do. You
can lift my wiper any day.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.582
Is it still Flag Day?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.167
For 12 more seconds, sir.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.170
Miss, would you submit to a
wooing by a gentleman caller?

07:01.254 --> 07:04.381
Oh, I'm sorry, but
you're really not my...

07:05.926 --> 07:07.551
Well, okay.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.679
O frabjous day! She said yes!

07:13.642 --> 07:15.810
He'll pick you up at
7:00. Wear a petticoat.

07:15.894 --> 07:16.894
Petticoat?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.021
Here's a place that rents them.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.486
It's about time Mr. Burns found a woman.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.447
I can't stand to see a man single.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.825
Some people enjoy being alone, Mom.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.285
No. Everyone should be paired up.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.752
It wasn't meant to be.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.463
I've gotta be honest, Monty.

07:44.548 --> 07:48.467
I've never dated anyone
who knew Calvin Coolidge.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.721
Well, I've never dated anyone
with their original hair and teeth.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.980
You're a nice guy, Monty. You're always
laughing and tenting your fingers.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.481
I like that.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.818
Excellent.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.238
And you're so upbeat. You
think everything's excellent.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.451
I really feel safe with you. It's
like going out with my brother.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.620
Yes! It's going great!

08:16.997 --> 08:19.081
So, what are you into?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.417
"Into"? Yeah.

08:21.543 --> 08:25.421
Like, what's a fun
day for 104-year-old?

08:25.797 --> 08:29.341
Oh, I enjoy all the popular youth trends

08:30.886 --> 08:34.763
like piloting motor coaches
and collecting dog waste.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.102
So, what shall we do
tomorrow? Go grousing?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.230
Or if you'd rather stay
home, you could sing

08:43.315 --> 08:45.149
while I accompany you on the clavichord.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.026
Actually, Monty, I...

08:47.110 --> 08:50.988
I've got some wonderful stereopticon
images of the Crimean War.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.866
Look, I had a lot of fun today,

08:53.950 --> 08:56.327
but I don't think we're
right for each other.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.288
The age difference is just too...

08:59.748 --> 09:03.334
Balderdash! It's not important
how old you are on parchment.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.669
It's how old you feel in the humors.

09:05.754 --> 09:06.962
I'm sorry, Monty...

09:07.047 --> 09:09.173
Stop that dog! It has my gum!

09:09.257 --> 09:12.259
Look. There's one of my
young chums now. You there!

09:13.094 --> 09:14.345
Yes, Mr. Burns?

09:14.429 --> 09:17.056
Tell my young sweetheart
here of our youthful exploits.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.557
Uh...

09:19.351 --> 09:22.353
Play along, chubsy.
There's a pie in it for you.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.732
Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man!

09:27.150 --> 09:28.901
Yeah! Whoa!

09:28.985 --> 09:30.819
He ran his own casino,

09:30.904 --> 09:34.114
stole the Loch Ness
monster, got shot by a baby,

09:34.199 --> 09:36.075
and blotted out the sun!

09:36.159 --> 09:37.701
Wow. That was you?

09:37.786 --> 09:39.411
So, shall I pick you up at 8:00?

09:39.496 --> 09:40.537
Well...

09:40.622 --> 09:43.165
Come on. He's a total player.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.085
Okay. Stop kicking my door.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.465
Well done, young man.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.175
Your youthful trendiness
will come in handy

09:53.260 --> 09:54.802
throughout the courting process,

09:54.886 --> 09:56.929
because these days, you...

09:57.681 --> 09:59.390
Where did you get that pie?

09:59.474 --> 10:00.683
Windowsill.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.941
New underpants? Homer,
what are you up to?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.901
Burns wants me to come along on his date

10:10.986 --> 10:13.904
to show him where hip young people go.

10:13.989 --> 10:18.117
Well, don't look too hip. You don't
want that girl falling for you.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.744
You're right!

10:22.205 --> 10:24.957
These would stop Joan Collins herself!

10:31.673 --> 10:34.550
Drat! I wish that song were longer.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.847
I've got to admit, you
can really shake it.

10:39.931 --> 10:42.766
Yes. That's totally voluntary.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.145
So, you guys come here all the time?

10:48.231 --> 10:49.273
Constantly.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.691
When we're not being kicked out

10:50.775 --> 10:53.861
for our rowdy youthful
behavior, eh, pally?

10:53.945 --> 10:58.324
Yep. No one's rowdier or more
youthful than Old Man Burns!

10:58.408 --> 11:00.409
You mean Young Man Burns.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.997
Put my hand on her knee.

11:05.415 --> 11:06.915
Yes, Mr. Burns.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.419
I said her. And I said knee.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.795
Oh! Sorry.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.966
I'm going to make such love to you

11:16.051 --> 11:18.344
that you'll forget all
about Rudolph Valentino.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.386
Turn left here.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.471
No problem.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.181
Mmm.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.188
All right, you're dismissed.
I'll take it from here.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.981
But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.609
Yes. But I have a little secret.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.612
I've obtained a rare
powerful aphrodisiac.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.823
It was made from the
pockets of the pocket fox,

11:39.908 --> 11:43.410
an animal that only existed for
three weeks in the 16th century.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.251
See you tomorrow night, Simpson!

11:53.004 --> 11:54.254
Huh?

12:03.640 --> 12:07.184
Homie, that was amazing!

12:07.769 --> 12:09.978
I hope the kids didn't hear us.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.483
Wow.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.531
Burns looks happy today.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.700
Watch me take advantage
of his good mood.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.246
Mr. Burns? Can I have a raise?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.373
Clean out your desk. You're gone.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.958
Well, I had a good run.

12:31.042 --> 12:34.545
If I counted all of the things I've got

12:34.671 --> 12:38.090
You might really think I had a lot

12:38.341 --> 12:43.137
But I won't be satisfied
if I don't have you

12:45.640 --> 12:48.851
Living in a castle like a king

12:49.352 --> 12:52.312
Wouldn't be much fun without my queen

12:53.523 --> 12:57.693
And I'd probably throw it
all away if I don't have you

13:02.157 --> 13:05.284
Once again, my dear, you've
beaten two strapping young bucks!

13:05.368 --> 13:06.702
Excellent.

13:07.704 --> 13:12.124
Did you hear that? That
"excellent" was excellent.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.877
Can I have some ice
cream? I finished my pizza.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.630
In time, in time. I need to
speak with you in private.

13:19.299 --> 13:24.178
Back in a moment, my dear. We
have to... Expel some urine!

13:25.221 --> 13:27.473
You're going to ask her to marry you?

13:27.557 --> 13:30.893
Isn't it wonderful? I'm
head over heels in love!

13:31.186 --> 13:33.479
Are you sure you want
to do this so fast?

13:33.563 --> 13:37.900
Yes. My biological clock is
ticking. I could be dead again soon.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.944
Wait, my dear. I think you'll find

13:41.029 --> 13:44.239
that red ball more "engaging. "

13:44.657 --> 13:45.699
Hmm?

13:51.039 --> 13:54.291
Monty, it's beautiful.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.376
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

13:56.461 --> 13:58.921
Gloria, say you'll marry me.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.845
Oh, Montgomery. Of
course I'll marry you.

14:07.472 --> 14:12.100
Spectacular! Now we must celebrate.
I'll get some Champagne-iola!

14:12.602 --> 14:15.229
This is the happiest day of my life.

14:15.313 --> 14:19.191
Nothing could spoil
it. Absolutely nothing.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.779
Okay, gun. Check.

14:24.405 --> 14:30.702
Dollar-sign bag, check. Power bar,
check. All right! Let's rob this...

14:32.038 --> 14:34.790
Bowling alley? Okay, whatever.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.628
All right! Totally... Gloria?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.673
Snake? I thought you were in prison.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.927
I was. I told the guard that I was
going out for a pack of cigarettes.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.887
Then I totally stabbed him.

14:50.515 --> 14:54.643
You're looking good, baby.
Why did we ever break up?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.729
You pushed me out of a moving car.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.149
The cops were chasing us. I
needed to lighten the load.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.527
And, um, protect you.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.820
Ha, ha.

15:04.988 --> 15:08.782
Come on, baby. We can
talk more at my hideout.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.661
No! I'm engaged now! My ring!

15:14.664 --> 15:16.915
Let go of her, or I'll scream!

15:18.459 --> 15:20.085
Callooh! Callay! We're in luck!

15:20.169 --> 15:22.879
They had a magnum at the
shoe counter. Now for...

15:23.506 --> 15:24.715
Gloria?

15:27.510 --> 15:28.760
Her ring.

15:30.138 --> 15:33.432
Well, she's run off! With Simpson.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.524
Well, this is my house.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.318
Uh-uh.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.237
Jeez, I just wanted to escape.

15:48.990 --> 15:53.076
Gloria, you better tell your
boyfriend to be a good little hostage.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.121
He's not my boyfriend. Mr. Burns is.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.956
Homer just comes along on our dates

15:58.041 --> 15:59.625
and carries us to the bedroom.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.920
You're dating that old trilobite? Gross!

16:04.422 --> 16:06.340
We're in love, Snake.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.216
Don't say that, baby.

16:08.301 --> 16:12.471
I'm gonna win you back if I have
to pistol-whip this guy all night.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.097
Pistol-whip?

16:14.265 --> 16:15.682
Ooh.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.225
Mmm.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.854
Pistol Whip.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.648
Local authorities are confident

16:22.732 --> 16:24.650
the killer bees are just curious

16:24.734 --> 16:27.319
and won't bother us if
we don't bother them.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.363
On a serious note, two local residents

16:29.447 --> 16:31.281
have been missing for
the last 20 minutes.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.909
We take you now live
to Barney's Bowlarama

16:33.993 --> 16:36.953
and the last man who saw
them, C. Montgomery Burns.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.330
I don't understand.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.791
She was my young sexy fiancÃ©e.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.251
He was my sexually-virile best friend,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.421
and they just drove off
in my Bugatti Sexarossa.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.298
How could this ever have happened?

16:48.383 --> 16:53.178
Well, according to our audience
insta-poll, 46% say you're too old,

16:53.262 --> 16:55.555
and 37% say she's a skank.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.434
Almost there.

17:06.442 --> 17:10.028
Wow. Who do you have to kill
to get a place like this?

17:10.113 --> 17:12.406
I think his name was Gustafson.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.074
Ow!

17:16.077 --> 17:18.119
Let me guess. Now you're gonna start

17:18.204 --> 17:20.789
working him over with
the brass knuckles.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.040
You are so predictable.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.460
You know what would be
surprising? A foot massage.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.170
Shut up. D'oh!

17:27.296 --> 17:30.799
Beating a man to a bloody
pulp isn't going to impress me.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.719
It used to. What if I beat him harder?

17:33.803 --> 17:36.096
Wow, you so don't get it.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.641
Has the ship sailed on my
foot massage suggestion?

17:41.436 --> 17:42.936
Don't worry, Mr. Burns.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.565
We'll track down Simpson with
your vehicle's anti-theft system.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.400
Car gone! Car gone!

17:48.484 --> 17:51.069
Yeah, we know that.
Where has it gone to?

17:51.154 --> 17:53.613
Car gone! Car gone! Car gone!

17:53.823 --> 17:57.325
Chief? This yokel says he saw
Simpson driving down near Hickton.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.493
Uh-huh.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.662
My peepers don't lie.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.748
That's nice work, Lou. Lock him up.

18:02.832 --> 18:03.832
Huh?

18:03.916 --> 18:08.712
Hey! Hey, I want that lawyer
what wears the cowboy hat.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.257
Release the girl, Simpson!

18:12.842 --> 18:15.260
I think I can take him out, Chief.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.515
That's a sweet shot.
He's tied to a chair.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.894
That means Dad's not a
kidnapper, he's a hostage!

18:25.396 --> 18:30.233
Get off my lawn, coppers, or I'll
totally turn the sprinklers on!

18:30.568 --> 18:34.237
Come on, Snake. You don't
want to soak all these people.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.908
We're in minute two of this
standoff. What's the situation, Chief?

18:37.992 --> 18:40.577
Well, we have an officer
sneaking around the house, Kent,

18:40.661 --> 18:42.621
so unless they have
a television in there

18:42.705 --> 18:44.539
or can hear my loud talking...

18:46.209 --> 18:47.584
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:48.002 --> 18:50.128
Well, I guess that
answers that, doesn't it?

18:50.213 --> 18:55.550
I swear I can change, Gloria. I'm
taking classes in computer fraud.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.845
That's what you said about
the telemarketing scams.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.722
But you didn't stick with it.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.225
I don't like bothering people at home.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.020
Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning.

19:07.522 --> 19:11.233
Almost there. Just a little more. Wait!

19:24.247 --> 19:26.832
But Gloria is still inside! Save her!

19:28.417 --> 19:31.753
It's too dangerous! But I
got a sister you might like.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.089
She's completely
hairless, like those cats.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.926
I don't care if she's Miss
Hairless America! I'm spoken for.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.887
Now step aside. I'll save Gloria myself.

19:41.889 --> 19:46.351
You? No offense, but you're
a decrepit monkey skeleton.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.521
Perhaps. But this monkey
skeleton is in love!

19:57.947 --> 19:58.947
Oh.

19:59.282 --> 20:02.617
Who am I kidding? I'm
just a feeble old man.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.496
Gloria!

20:10.877 --> 20:13.044
He did it! He saved her!

20:15.631 --> 20:17.966
Well, the important thing
is they're both safe.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.223
I know you've been through a lot, ma'am,

20:25.308 --> 20:27.517
but we need you to stand in front
of the burning house and say,

20:27.602 --> 20:29.811
"Channel 6 is hot, hot, hot!"

20:30.313 --> 20:33.565
Wow, Mr. Burns. How did you do that?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.442
Never forget, Homer.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.862
There's no muscle stronger
than the human heart.

20:39.113 --> 20:43.158
What about the wiener? A guy on
TV lifted a can of paint with his.

20:43.451 --> 20:44.618
Yes.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.661
Monty, you saved me!

20:46.996 --> 20:51.166
And to think I was once in
love with that dirty lowlife

20:51.500 --> 20:54.628
with his arrogant smirk, gutter mouth,

20:54.962 --> 20:58.506
tough-guy attitude, macho tattoos,

20:58.633 --> 21:00.300
hair that can't be tamed,

21:00.384 --> 21:03.553
prison-sculpted body...

21:04.513 --> 21:05.805
Uh-oh.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.601
I'm sorry, Monty.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.811
Oh, Snake! Don't ever change.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.022
Yeah, but... But you...

21:14.857 --> 21:17.776
I don't get it, Simpson.
I'm a "bad boy. "

21:17.860 --> 21:19.444
Oh, I know.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.321
I'm absolutely evil.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.948
You're preaching to the choir, man.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.075
What do I have to do?
Grow a devil beard?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.451
Devil beard?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.703
You know, the little goatee thing.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.163
You mean a Vandyke?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.332
No, a Vandyke has a
moustache, doesn't it?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.792
I think it can.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.543
Are you talking about a soul patch?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.629
No! Wait. Maybe.
