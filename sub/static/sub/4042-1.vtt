<i>Welcome back to</i> Celebrity Dance Factor.

00:52.852 --> 00:55.116
I'm Hutch Davidson
and we are live from Hollywood

00:55.188 --> 00:57.748
just moments away from crowning
our season champion.

00:58.158 --> 01:01.355
Now, we've just seen the last dances
from our first two finalists.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.654
Reality television star, Whitney Port.

01:08.601 --> 01:11.468
And Miami Heat basketball star,
Dwyane Wade.

01:17.811 --> 01:21.941
Which brings us to our last, but certainly
not least, finalist of the night.

01:22.148 --> 01:25.777
Everyone's favorite tough love trainer from
the weight-loss show, <i>Lose it and Weep.</i>

01:25.985 --> 01:27.316
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna throw up.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.912
- We got this. We got this, okay?
- You're right. We can do this.

01:29.989 --> 01:32.184
- Just one more dance. One more dance.
- We know how to do this.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.284
Jules Baxter
and her partner, Evan Webber!

02:25.578 --> 02:27.478
Alex, quick, come see this!

02:28.815 --> 02:29.941
What are you watching?

02:30.016 --> 02:31.415
<i>Celebrity Dance Factor.</i>

02:31.484 --> 02:33.213
- No.
- It's the finals!

02:33.286 --> 02:34.947
Even I need a cold shower after that one.

02:35.021 --> 02:38.479
Let's turn to our esteemed panel ofjudges.
Tyce? Let's hear your score.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.223
Five stars!

02:44.330 --> 02:45.888
Okay. Cheryl Cole?

02:46.199 --> 02:48.599
You know what, if I had six stars,
I'd give you the six.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.795
But I've only got five,
so you can have those.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.968
- Jules is taking it.
- No. I think D-Wade has it.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.338
- What?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:56.409 --> 02:59.242
And Taboo of The Black Eyed Peas,
let's have your thoughts.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.803
It wasrt for me, so I gave you a three.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.545
- Dude. She's totally doing him.
- No way.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.676
Don't question the sage insights
of <i>Star Buzz.</i>

03:06.753 --> 03:09.051
<i>We've tallied the judges' scores</i>
<i>and added them to our viewers' votes.</i>

03:13.960 --> 03:15.928
May I have the envelope, please?

03:16.729 --> 03:17.753
Thank you.

03:20.200 --> 03:25.638
And the winner of <i>Celebrity Dance Factor,</i>
Season 15 is...

03:34.280 --> 03:35.508
I can't...

03:37.617 --> 03:39.915
Jules Baxter and Evan Webber!

04:10.350 --> 04:11.817
<i>Jules? Are you okay?</i>

04:11.884 --> 04:12.942
<i>I'm sorry. So sorry.</i>

04:13.353 --> 04:15.981
Let's hope she's not pregnant, folks.

04:19.625 --> 04:20.649
Fireworks!

04:32.572 --> 04:35.598
Book signing. <i>Milk It!</i> the book!

04:35.675 --> 04:37.905
Pictures of breasts inside!

04:38.311 --> 04:40.745
Welcome, everyone, to The Breast Choice.

04:40.813 --> 04:44.681
I'm Wendy Cooper, wearing two hats today
as store owner

04:44.851 --> 04:48.878
and author of my very first
childrers book <i>Milk It!</i>

04:50.023 --> 04:51.547
Yay!

04:51.891 --> 04:54.018
So let's get started.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.526
Hi.

04:57.897 --> 04:59.990
"Goats do it.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.464
"Cows do it.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.464
"Kitties do it.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.701
"Even dolphins in the sea do it.

05:08.474 --> 05:12.706
"When your mommy uses her breasts
to feed a baby

05:12.912 --> 05:15.506
"she is feeding her baby the..."

05:15.581 --> 05:16.843
Tits!

05:16.916 --> 05:18.110
Gary!

05:18.985 --> 05:20.816
Okay, okay. Sorry. I got it. I got it.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.618
- Hey, kid!
- All right!

05:23.690 --> 05:26.420
- They're called breasts.
- Thank you all for coming.

05:26.559 --> 05:30.154
It was just lovely. And hug your mommies
for breast-feeding you.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.823
- Thank you.
- Bye. Thank you. See you.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.493
- Hey! Great job, hon!
- Did you get that kid?

05:35.568 --> 05:36.796
No. He was too fast.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.870
But I said some choice words.
They were very choice.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.702
Punk. Next time, get him.

05:41.774 --> 05:45.039
Okay. I will. But what's important right now?

05:46.512 --> 05:47.740
That I just had my first reading.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.806
Yeah! Yeah, you did! You did great.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.215
- I gotta get back, okay?
- What? No! Gar!

05:53.286 --> 05:55.777
- Lil Wayne is waiting.
- Can't some other dentist do it?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.948
Squeaks, it's my first grill!

05:58.558 --> 05:59.957
- Right? Yeah.
- All right.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.755
- It's a big deal.
- I was gonna take you to lunch, but okay.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.388
Next time, all right?
Congratulations! Great job!

06:07.767 --> 06:09.394
- Gar!
- Yeah?

06:14.707 --> 06:15.731
Two minutes.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.136
- I gotta go.
- Honey!

06:17.210 --> 06:18.507
- Honey, I got to go, I got...
- Honey!

06:22.582 --> 06:23.571
- Janice!
- Yeah.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.048
I'm taking Gary in the back.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.790
Look, we can do this the easy way
or we can do this the hard way.

06:32.892 --> 06:36.555
And I get it, you're naked, you're vulnerable
but this is a safe place, you know.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.325
No need to resort to cheap theatrics.

06:39.999 --> 06:43.400
We're better than that, right? We're artists.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.596
So, let's just keep it dignified.

06:49.542 --> 06:50.975
Look, kid.

06:51.043 --> 06:55.207
If you don't smile, your mom doesn't buy
any prints and I don't get paid.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.643
So, suck it up.

06:57.683 --> 07:00.447
All right, baby. You like it when I'm bossy?

07:01.220 --> 07:03.518
Okay! Okay.

07:03.990 --> 07:08.518
Work the feet. Show me those gums!
That's it, baby!

07:11.764 --> 07:14.324
Holly, these are amazing.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.528
Well, I can give you 20% off
on prints if you order today.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.506
- Oh, my God! I am so sorry.
- Okay!

07:23.276 --> 07:26.211
That's okay. It happens.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.338
You know the last guy
who threw up on me?

07:28.414 --> 07:30.473
You know what I did? I married him.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.611
You're so good with kids.
You should have one of your own.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.313
Yeah. That's kind of the plan.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.822
Well, don't wait too long.
You don't wanna miss your window.

07:37.890 --> 07:38.982
Right.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.494
Yeah! Let's get you cleaned up. Yeah.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.390
What do you got?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.524
Some wine, cheese and crackers,
your favorites.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.124
That's a real treat.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.596
So what's the movie anyway?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.400
<i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

07:53.473 --> 07:56.203
All right! That's a good one. Yeah.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.139
What are you...

08:00.646 --> 08:02.637
I would like to propose a toast.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.741
Okay. But you haven't had a drink
in two years.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.609
I just...

08:07.687 --> 08:09.848
I think we should take a break from trying.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.184
And just be us for a while.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.257
All right. I'll drink to that. Sure.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.355
To us.

08:16.429 --> 08:20.058
And if that doesn't work
we'll do three rounds of IVF.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.631
And if that doesn't work,

08:23.703 --> 08:25.000
we'll just adopt, which will be great,

08:25.071 --> 08:27.972
because I have no fears,
genetic or otherwise.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.302
To us.

08:31.544 --> 08:33.409
To not snuffing out the flame.

08:33.479 --> 08:34.639
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.914
What are you doing? Oh, my God!
Are you gonna go for it?

08:41.187 --> 08:43.347
You're going for it. You did it.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.822
You just... You crushed it.
You crushed a glass of wine.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.390
Oh, my God, I'm wasted.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.225
Yeah, I bet you are!

08:50.463 --> 08:54.194
It's so good. Why have I wasted two years
not drinking this?

08:54.667 --> 08:56.794
Oh, my God! The Big Pig is here.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.733
- I didn't even get a tweet!
- All right, people.

08:58.804 --> 09:01.238
It's swine time, let's go!
What do you want, bud?

09:01.307 --> 09:04.708
Yeah, give me two carnitas tacos
and a jalapeno fritter.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.768
Good man. You have your cardiologist
on speed dial, right?

09:06.913 --> 09:08.505
Right? You do, right? Hey, girls.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.383
How are you?
Best meal on wheels right here.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.885
Tell that to my cheese and bacon panini.
Total foodgasm.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.688
Bacon?

09:18.157 --> 09:19.488
Have a good night.

09:21.994 --> 09:23.018
Bacon.

09:23.195 --> 09:26.358
You know what? I'm also gonna get
the Georgia Dog Special.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.533
- Yo, chef. Where're you going?
- Two seconds.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.398
I added to my order.
Do you think he heard it?

09:30.469 --> 09:32.664
I can't do anything with gloves on.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.428
What can I get you guys?

09:35.942 --> 09:37.000
All right, excellent choice.

09:37.109 --> 09:39.134
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

09:39.812 --> 09:41.143
There's a line if you want to order.

09:41.213 --> 09:45.047
The only thing I'm ordering is for you
to stop serving bacon, okay? Pig's our turf.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.984
Oh, my God! Your turf?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.650
- Yeah.
- Is this <i>West Side Story?</i>

09:50.723 --> 09:51.712
Are we gonna rumble at midnight?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.351
You know what, maybe I got
a whole gang of back-up dancers

09:54.427 --> 09:56.019
- just ready to go, okay?
- Wow!

09:56.128 --> 09:58.119
You're the cheese truck, so stick to cheese.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.256
- Can I order now?
- No! Just give me one second, please.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.697
That's funny, 'cause I noticed that those
jalapeno fritters you guys are serving...

10:03.769 --> 10:06.863
Are awesome, right? They're my invention.
I made them.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.497
They have ricotta cheese in them.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.439
Come on! That's like a little bit of cheese.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.170
That's nothing compared
to the bacon crutch

10:12.244 --> 10:13.768
you're propping these sandwiches up on.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.406
They're paninis, they're grilled peach
and blue cheese paninis,

10:16.482 --> 10:17.949
with a dash of bacon.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.746
Also awesome. Also my invention.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.887
All right, you wanna go? Let's go.
Your special against my special.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.549
Whoever sells the most tonight, wins.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.225
- Fine.
- Fine.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.319
All right, if I win,
you have to have a drink with me.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.320
And if you win, you may have

10:32.965 --> 10:34.626
- three drinks with me.
- That's cute.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.191
So you can stand me up again?
No thank you.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.466
That was five years ago.
But that's sweet you still remember that.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.905
I'm impressed, Rosie.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.067
I'll see you in the field, all right?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.043
- It doesn't keep me up nights.
- Sure.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.477
Who's that?

10:48.114 --> 10:50.480
This guy from high school. Total player.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.042
I'd play with that.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.984
Don't be gross. Don't be that girl.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.789
You're not still hungry, are you?

11:00.860 --> 11:03.920
I don't know. It depends on what you got left
in your picnic basket.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.193
Dr. Cooper. We're in a public place.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.962
I know. It's all so unscheduled.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.093
I win.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.198
What did you think was gonna happen?

11:44.270 --> 11:48.400
Well, I asked you to prom first, all right.
And then you said, "Maybe"

11:48.474 --> 11:49.873
- so I decided to ask someone else.
- No, I didn't...

11:49.942 --> 11:52.706
Yes, you did. So I asked someone else.
Then you said, "Yes."

11:53.279 --> 11:56.874
So I tried to take you both.
What's so wrong with that?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.509
- I'm not saying it worked.
- Fine.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.844
I blocked out most of high school anyway.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.786
Hey. Where'd you get this guy?

12:04.957 --> 12:06.447
I fought a grill and the grill won.

12:06.525 --> 12:07.992
Why'd you fight the grill?
It always wins.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.324
- "Chef hands." Occupational hazard.
- Yeah, guys love it, though.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.293
- Do they?
- Guys love burned hands.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.661
Yeah? Check this out. Okay.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.133
First time breaking down a pig
when I was 16.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.169
- Five stitches. Five. Yeah.
- Five?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.205
- That is adorable!
- I wasrt asking your opinion, that's okay.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.035
- That is adorable!
- All right, I wasrt asking your opinion.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.804
Look. A deli slicer
nearly took my whole thumb off.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.573
All right. Second-degree burn.
Making caramels.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.213
- Your own fault.
- Yeah, I know.

12:30.282 --> 12:31.874
Home-made is the best, though.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.283
- So good for you for trying.
- Never again. Never again.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.014
- Julienning shallots.
- Julienning shallots?

12:37.089 --> 12:39.580
'Cause Julianne, ex-girlfriend, right there,
she got me.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.853
- Julianne. I see what you did there.
- I know.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.020
- That's good.
- Yeah? It was good, right? I saved it for you.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.030
Whoever she was, you probably deserved it.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.800
What? You are so mean.
Are you always this mean?

12:48.901 --> 12:51.301
- Always.
- Is that your gift?

12:51.804 --> 12:53.032
Always?

12:57.343 --> 12:58.935
Okay.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.003
Okay, Trouble. I'm gonna go.

13:02.314 --> 13:04.111
- You're gonna go?
- I'm gonna go.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.251
- It's been super real.
- Where do you think you're going?

13:07.319 --> 13:11.153
- It's been great catching up with you...
- Yes!

13:11.457 --> 13:12.924
Formal handshake. Good to see you.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.653
Maybe I'll see you on the truck line

13:14.727 --> 13:15.785
- again sometime, right?
- Yeah.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.256
Yeah, Rosie Brennan.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.456
- Your hands are on my waist.
- They are on your waist, aren't they?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.762
How did they find themselves there?
I don't know.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.235
This is really awkward, isn't it?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.271
Well, if you don't stop me,
I'm just gonna kiss you.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.272
Is that gonna be okay?

13:44.223 --> 13:46.589
This is me getting in my car.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.058
This is you waving goodbye.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.530
My zipper's stuck.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.037
Is that our alarm?

14:00.105 --> 14:01.163
What?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.834
- Yeah. Definitely.
- No, I think our car's that way.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.308
<i>No, it's this way.</i>

14:22.428 --> 14:23.759
Water feels so good.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.160
Good, baby.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.390
Do you want some tea?

14:26.599 --> 14:27.861
No.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.028
Are you sure you're not freaking out?

14:30.102 --> 14:33.936
Seriously, I mean, just say so.
I can handle it.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.538
Freak out's a little strong.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.873
I really thought I had a bum fallopian tube.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.044
- I just don't wanna force it.
- Hey, Crazy.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.680
I wanted to be with you
before you were pregnant.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.014
This just speeds things up a little.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.311
- A lot.
- So?

14:50.155 --> 14:52.180
We're old enough. We love each other.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.256
What's to figure out?

14:55.327 --> 14:58.023
Apart from what are you gonna do
about your show?

14:58.097 --> 15:00.429
Well, we start filming in three weeks

15:00.499 --> 15:03.059
and I'll be finished before I have to deliver.

15:03.969 --> 15:08.531
So, basically, I am going to be
helping people get thin while I get fat.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.338
What are you doing?

15:11.510 --> 15:13.000
Yeah!

15:15.514 --> 15:18.677
- Shit! My tattoo!
- So what?

15:19.118 --> 15:22.554
You're not gonna be the only mom out there
with that Spring Break dolphin. Trust me.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.181
But those other moms
aren't getting judged like me.

15:25.457 --> 15:28.119
Good call, Holly.
"I'll never get tired of a dolphin."

15:29.128 --> 15:31.688
I'm not tired of it. I smile every time I see it.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.698
Oh, God! Stop!

15:38.404 --> 15:39.462
Let's do it.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.903
- Let's see.
- Okay.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.775
No, no, no!

15:43.842 --> 15:44.866
What? No!

15:45.210 --> 15:47.610
- Even our wedding photo?
- I'm not taking any chances.

15:47.880 --> 15:48.904
Okay?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.541
Be normal.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.889
And you're planning on
bringing the baby home here?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.116
- Yeah, we're...
- No.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.751
No, this is just a rental.

16:01.827 --> 16:04.091
We're buying a house, a really nice house.

16:04.163 --> 16:08.429
A big yard, one story,
no pool or sharp edges of any kind.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.264
Yeah, we're moving into a padded cell.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.897
And why did you choose Ethiopia?

16:14.907 --> 16:18.138
Honestly, we would have been happy
adopting from anywhere.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.771
We were on a waiting list for Guatemala,
but then they closed their adoptions.

16:21.847 --> 16:25.112
So we started researching Ethiopia
and we just...

16:25.451 --> 16:27.942
We just really fell in love with the culture.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.618
Plus, all the white babies were taken.

16:32.257 --> 16:33.690
You're a comedian?

16:34.693 --> 16:36.183
- No. He's not.
- No.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.089
- He's not even funny. At all.
- Yeah.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.759
What he does is, he actually picks songs
for commercials for an ad agency.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.062
- Great health insurance.
- Yeah.

16:46.138 --> 16:49.539
They're working on a big ad
for Delta Air Lines...

16:49.608 --> 16:52.099
Well, we're bidding on it.
It's not a done deal yet.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.570
And how's the photography business?

16:54.646 --> 16:57.206
Well, I'm still waiting for the Guggeneim
to start collecting my work.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.012
But until then, I'm shooting at
the Aquarium.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.144
And, you know, it pays the bills.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.124
"All the white babies were taken"?

17:06.191 --> 17:07.657
What?

17:08.827 --> 17:09.885
Cookie?

17:09.962 --> 17:10.986
No, thank you.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.223
So you think we're looking at a year?

17:14.299 --> 17:17.757
Well, every case has its own timeline.
You just have to be patient.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.297
But on average, yes, a year. Maybe more.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.936
More?

17:23.976 --> 17:27.570
I could work with that, right?
Yeah, that sounds good.

17:27.945 --> 17:30.176
So does that mean you like us?

17:31.450 --> 17:32.974
I don't see any red flags.

17:33.152 --> 17:36.349
But you need to baby-proof
if you're going to stay here.

17:36.622 --> 17:37.987
Yeah. Of course.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.516
Do you have a wedding photo?

17:39.591 --> 17:41.889
The Ethiopian authorities really like to
see that in the packet.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.825
- No.
- Yeah, we do.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.091
- Of course we do. Yeah, we do.
- No, we don't. We lost it.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.293
- Yeah. We do. Where is it?
- No! No! No!

17:50.536 --> 17:53.437
I think it's right here.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.736
Vegas. It was a costume wedding.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.201
I was Prince, Holly was a showgirl.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.237
He loves <i>Purple Rain.</i>

18:04.383 --> 18:06.681
You know what, why don't we just say
it got burned in a fire?

18:06.952 --> 18:08.249
Good one.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.810
- Here.
- Thank you.

18:10.856 --> 18:14.121
Wendy, can I go
on my 15-minute Facebook break?

18:15.461 --> 18:16.519
Wendy?

18:17.229 --> 18:18.526
Wendy?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.622
Are you dead?

18:21.233 --> 18:22.495
Hey.

18:23.569 --> 18:27.061
Man, I was dreaming
that I had a kangaroo pouch.

18:27.539 --> 18:28.938
That sounds awesome.

18:29.408 --> 18:32.434
It was like a purse.
I could hide my snacks in it.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.910
You're like a human-kanga hybrid.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.441
I like to rub my breasts, too.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.386
Gary! Gar Bear!

18:49.528 --> 18:53.123
Gar! Gary! Gar Bear! Gar!

18:55.968 --> 18:57.458
- Wendy!
- We're pregnant!

18:57.736 --> 18:59.670
I'm with child! We're pregnant!

18:59.738 --> 19:01.433
- Oh, my God!
- We did it!

19:03.041 --> 19:07.034
My balls work! My balls work! Oh, my God!

19:07.379 --> 19:09.313
Keep it in your lane, people.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.178
I did it! I did it!

19:11.683 --> 19:14.151
- We did it! We're gonna have a baby!
- We made a baby!

19:19.158 --> 19:20.625
Shit!

19:20.692 --> 19:23.456
Rosie, hurry up!
I need my lucky bra for my interview.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.126
Ro!

19:26.498 --> 19:28.830
Two seconds, that's all I wanted.

19:29.434 --> 19:32.028
What's her deal?
I thought she finally got laid.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.128
I don't know.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.532
I love these hardwood floors!

19:36.808 --> 19:39.641
This is it, baby. It's so perfect.
This is the one.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.209
Are you insane?
We're not buying, we're just looking.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.843
You want the house or the baby?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.317
I want the house for the baby.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.616
We can't afford it.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.814
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.488
Hi.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.287
Look, this is it.
This is the one we have to get.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.523
We're just looking.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.301
- Stop worrying.
- Okay, okay.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.565
It's just, he gives me a hard time
when I'm late, you know.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.633
Don't let him get into your head.

20:09.708 --> 20:13.041
Yeah. Okay. You're right.
He can't ruin this. Not today.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.510
No.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.240
So, Dad.

20:19.518 --> 20:22.146
Wendy and I have
a little announcement to make.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.445
- We're pregnant!
- We're pregnant!

20:27.192 --> 20:28.318
Oh, my God!

20:28.827 --> 20:29.885
Isn't that great?

20:32.464 --> 20:33.726
- So are we!
- What?

20:33.799 --> 20:35.266
You're... What, are you... Are you kidding?

20:35.434 --> 20:38.995
Yeah, hell's bells.
I guess it's congratulations to all of us.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.072
Holy... I had no idea
that you guys were even trying.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.672
- We werert!
- No.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.871
Now, look, son,
there's no blanks in this pistol.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.345
Boom!

20:51.183 --> 20:53.242
You guys, you've been trying
for quite a while.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.149
What two, three months?
Something like that?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.978
Two years.

20:58.457 --> 20:59.856
Not everything's a race, Dad.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.116
- Gar.
- No.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.683
- Yeah. Right?
- No. Not everything.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.087
Only things where you can come in first.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.261
- Okay.
- Come on.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.199
Gary, let's celebrate.
Let's go to Margaritaville.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.203
- I don't wanna go to Margaritaville.
- Come on.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.704
I don't wanna go to Margaritaville.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.405
Everybody wants to go to Margaritaville.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.135
- I don't wanna go.
- Come on!

21:20.212 --> 21:22.840
I'm gonna break out
the Don Julio "Blank-o."

21:23.048 --> 21:26.506
"Blanco," Dad. "Blanco."
That's how you pronounce it.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.109
And it's 11:00 a.m., kind of early for shots.

21:29.488 --> 21:32.013
- It's 5:00 somewhere.
- True.

21:32.257 --> 21:34.384
- Don't be a pussy.
- You know what?

21:34.593 --> 21:36.857
Margaritaville is <i>abierto</i> for business.

21:36.928 --> 21:40.523
Wendy, I just have to say, I am just
so happy to have a baby expert in the family.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.862
Are you feeling anything yet?

21:42.934 --> 21:43.958
Joy.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.697
- Yeah.
- Some exhaustion.

21:45.937 --> 21:49.202
A little nausea. Some heartburn.
And my boobs are killing me.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.573
Plus, I have to pee every five minutes.

21:51.643 --> 21:56.307
But it's just proof
that a miracle is happening inside of me.

21:56.381 --> 21:57.973
So I'm so happy.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.550
It is a miracle, isn't it?

22:00.619 --> 22:03.349
I mean, I thought I'd have to
give up my Pilates, and my running

22:03.822 --> 22:07.952
- and tennis and my strip-aerobics.
- Sure.

22:08.026 --> 22:10.586
And kickboxing, just all my activities.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.926
But it just turns out
I have all this extra energy.

22:13.231 --> 22:15.199
- You know? You know?
- Oh, yeah.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.734
Plus,

22:16.802 --> 22:19.635
I'm like crazy-horny.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.132
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean,

22:22.274 --> 22:26.506
if I even get a whiff of Ramsey,
it's like I just have to pounce, you know?

22:26.578 --> 22:28.170
And I gotta give this old boy credit.

22:28.246 --> 22:32.512
He's still got that race car engine
that can go the distance.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.743
- Hormones. What're you gonna do?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.789
I don't know.
Maybe not talk about it at brunch?

22:37.856 --> 22:39.983
- Yep, that's what I'd do.
- That's what I'd do, too.

22:40.058 --> 22:41.719
We're on the same page on that one.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.658
Honey, I know you can't have any

22:43.762 --> 22:46.663
- so I'm gonna do one for you and the baby.
- The baby!

22:46.932 --> 22:48.058
Sweet.

22:48.967 --> 22:52.459
- Here's to the Coopers.
- Yeah, you know what, what the hell.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.164
Yeah.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.936
Well, that was delicious.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.772
Honey, I didn't make any of it.
You know Ramsey don't want me cooking.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.470
- Your mom and I...
- Not my mom.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.309
We sure wish y'all could stay longer.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.113
Yeah. That's the thing. It's such a bummer,

23:06.184 --> 23:08.880
but the missus
and little Mini Cooper and I,

23:08.954 --> 23:10.148
we have an appointment.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.985
- Yes, at...
- Walmart.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.524
- For paint.
- Yeah. And mulch.

23:13.592 --> 23:17.653
Well, you know what they say.
Money isn't everything,

23:17.729 --> 23:19.959
but sure keeps you connected to your kids.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.764
- So how much you need?
- Dad, I don't need any money.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.300
- I don't need any money.
- Come on. How much you need?

23:23.368 --> 23:25.461
No, I don't need anything at all.
Thank you so much.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.697
- Man pats.
- Man pats, that's great.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.240
Come here, baby, give your mama a kiss.

23:29.307 --> 23:30.467
- What?
- Okay...

23:30.542 --> 23:32.134
- Baby.
- Okay.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.804
My baby boy. I'm so proud of you.
You've grown up so fast.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.871
Okay, Gary. Gar.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.347
- What? Yeah.
- Okay.

23:39.484 --> 23:41.577
- Awesome. This was so much...
- All right. We'll see y'all later.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.621
Yeah, great, this was a thing, you know?

23:43.688 --> 23:45.553
- Congratulations!
- Yeah, congrats.

23:45.624 --> 23:48.320
- Come back soon!
- Don't ever kiss her again.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.456
Well...

23:52.731 --> 23:55.359
Okay. Are you sure you took the test right?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.796
You pee on a stick. It's idiot-proof.

23:58.870 --> 24:02.169
No, I know. It's just, you know, one time.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.264
Yeah.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.109
So what do you want to do?

24:10.982 --> 24:12.449
I don't know.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.551
What do you want to do?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.411
Look, I don't know.

24:17.489 --> 24:21.721
I just found out, okay? You're the girl.
Don't you get to decide?

24:21.793 --> 24:23.693
Great, great. So then it's all on me?

24:23.762 --> 24:25.753
No. No, I didn't mean...

24:27.732 --> 24:30.462
Shit. Should we get married?

24:31.102 --> 24:34.162
"Shit. Should we get married?" Yeah.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.237
No, it's just,
when you put it like that, that's...

24:37.309 --> 24:39.436
I'm sorry, Rosie.
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.

24:39.511 --> 24:42.309
- I didn't mean to...
- Then don't ask the wrong questions.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.443
- Just forget that I said anything.
- No.

24:46.518 --> 24:49.885
Just forget it 'cause I'll figure it out.
Whatever it is, it's not your problem.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.182
- Rosie!
- It's fine.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.780
I have to get back to the truck anyway.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.335
There he is!

25:06.071 --> 25:08.164
Perfect. Okay, guys, look right here.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.230
Big smile.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.538
Aristotle! Good smile!

25:14.346 --> 25:17.747
Okay, beautiful. You can pick up your prints
at the kiosk at the front.

25:17.949 --> 25:20.577
All right, everyone.
Aristotle needs his down time.

25:20.785 --> 25:22.514
Okay, can we all wave bye-bye?

25:22.921 --> 25:24.286
Bye!

25:24.623 --> 25:26.090
Thank you, nice friend.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.123
So, how's Alex? Is he excited?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.058
Yeah! Yeah! He's...

25:30.128 --> 25:33.757
No. Actually, he's... I don't know.

25:33.832 --> 25:36.062
I don't know. Maybe he's just not ready.

25:36.134 --> 25:38.125
- They're never ready.
- Yeah.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.262
Dude's group.

25:40.338 --> 25:41.669
- What?
- Dude's group.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.298
It's like <i>Fight Club,</i>

25:43.375 --> 25:45.707
only there's no fighting,
everybody has babies,

25:45.777 --> 25:47.802
they don't talk about what they do there.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.870
I don't know what they do there
and I don't need to know.

25:49.948 --> 25:52.883
All I know is that Craig started going
when I was pregnant with Henri

25:52.951 --> 25:55.010
- and he's losing his shit.
- Yeah.

25:55.086 --> 25:58.783
Now, he loves being a dad
and he never misses a Saturday.

25:58.857 --> 26:01.758
You want Alex ready?
Send him to the dudes.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.453
Your blood pressure is low
and you are in good health.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.397
- And Dad's gonna keep you that way, right?
- Right.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.366
- Look at these pamphlets.
- Thank you.

26:10.435 --> 26:12.528
That's all we need to know.
Let's not go crazy with the research.

26:12.604 --> 26:14.765
I love research. It soothes me.

26:14.839 --> 26:18.070
Well then, you'll love the wall.
I'll see you both in a month.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.837
Wow!

26:19.911 --> 26:21.742
- Look at the wall!
- No, no, no, no.

26:21.813 --> 26:24.008
I don't want to know about
everything that can go wrong.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.515
Oh, my God! Look at this.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.347
Okay, there's breast-feeding,
we have to know about this.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.712
Cord-blood-banking,
this is very important these days.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.985
You need to learn the Bradley Method.
And... What?

26:33.558 --> 26:35.253
"Circumcision: Yes or No?"

26:35.327 --> 26:37.488
Of course. How is that even a question?

26:37.562 --> 26:40.588
Actually, a lot of couples are choosing
not to circumcise these days.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.590
- Interesting.
- Who said that?

26:42.667 --> 26:45.101
The expert, honey.
So clearly, there's a question.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.571
- That's why it says "Yes or No?"
- My answer is "Yes." Yes! Yes!

26:48.673 --> 26:50.834
- My answer is, "I need to read about it."
- No more...

26:51.076 --> 26:52.839
See you tomorrow, okay?

27:01.152 --> 27:03.313
I'm not gonna forget it.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.288
<i>Can I get a "I can do it"? You can do it!</i>

27:08.860 --> 27:12.057
<i>- I can do it!</i>
<i>- Who are you doing it for?</i>

27:12.130 --> 27:13.961
Oh, my God.
Damn, this show gives me the munchies.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.294
<i>This is the beginning of the rest of your life!</i>

27:15.367 --> 27:17.062
I so wanna do that slide-y thing.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.898
I feel so bad, but it's hilarious.

27:18.970 --> 27:22.337
- No, no, this is just so funny.
- I hope they're having fun.

27:25.844 --> 27:26.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.774
Marco, this is Courtney and Molly.

27:29.014 --> 27:31.608
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- And vice-versa.

27:31.683 --> 27:35.312
I thought you said "Cute Marco."
Not "Hot Marco."

27:35.553 --> 27:37.418
Well done, Rosie.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.150
- Well done.
- You said I was cute?

27:39.224 --> 27:40.657
- Ignore them.
- Yeah, we did.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.657
So, you're going, right?

27:42.727 --> 27:44.592
No, I'm not. I've already got friends.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.529
- But these guys all have babies.
- Yeah. That sounds terrible.

27:48.433 --> 27:51.027
Craig goes. You like Craig.

27:51.102 --> 27:54.003
I tolerate Craig at a barbecue.
Not as a forced play date.

27:57.242 --> 28:01.508
- Lf you go, just once...
- Holly, I am trying to work here, okay?

28:02.313 --> 28:05.407
- Oh, my God!
- I'll give you one right here, right now.

28:06.284 --> 28:07.717
Really?

28:07.786 --> 28:09.481
- Right here, right now?
- Yes.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.327
Hey, Craig.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.700
Alex, Vic. Vic, Alex.

29:34.472 --> 29:35.734
Welcome to Happy Hour.

29:36.307 --> 29:37.399
Let's walk.

29:42.046 --> 29:44.310
I sense your fear, Alex. It's cool.

29:44.716 --> 29:45.876
You're still on the other side.

29:46.151 --> 29:47.846
Stay on that side, Alex.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.614
This is the side
where happiness goes to die.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.245
Don't mind Craig. He's had a bad week.

29:51.823 --> 29:55.589
Kara just took a three-day business trip
and little Henry there just got sick.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.585
- Here you go, big boy. Walk it off.
- Thanks.

29:58.663 --> 30:02.394
By the way, when we're around Kara,
it's still "Henri." "Henry's" on the DL.

30:03.034 --> 30:04.695
- Henri.
- You got that, Alex?

30:04.769 --> 30:06.760
It's very important. That's the first rule.

30:06.905 --> 30:09.237
- Don't talk about what we walk about.
- Rule #1.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.399
Got it.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.672
See, Alex, women pretty much control
the baby universe. And why not?

30:13.745 --> 30:16.942
They carried the damn things,
pushed them outta their vaginas.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.779
I never used to use that word
for that part of the body but, trust me,

30:19.884 --> 30:22.250
once a baby comes out of it, it's a vagina.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.614
- Yeah!
- It changes.

30:23.688 --> 30:26.623
Here, we're free.
No one's looking over your shoulder.

30:26.691 --> 30:29.387
If you put the diaper on backwards
or forget to heat the bottle up,

30:29.561 --> 30:30.960
you go with it.

30:31.062 --> 30:33.656
If you wanna ditch those carrot sticks
and feed your kid McNuggets

30:33.731 --> 30:34.993
- you go for it.
- Who cares?

30:35.099 --> 30:37.192
And if your wife named your kid "Henri"

30:37.268 --> 30:39.327
and you wanna ignore
that silent-H bullshit...

30:39.404 --> 30:41.964
- Bullshit!
...you're in a safe place. What's up, Henry!

30:42.040 --> 30:43.337
- Good to know.
- Henri. What is he, a mime?

30:43.741 --> 30:46.574
Where does "Henri" come from anyway?

30:46.644 --> 30:48.874
<i>- Cirque du Soleil.</i>
- So dumb.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.612
It looks like
you've got your hands full there.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.878
Yeah, I got four under five.

30:54.352 --> 30:58.220
One more, we can run a full court.
Two more and I got pallbearers.

30:58.489 --> 31:02.892
I got Evander here. Venus and Jeter
are my twins, and my main man Jordan.

31:03.294 --> 31:07.822
Sure, twice a year, I think about the price
of college and cry in my car for a half hour.

31:07.899 --> 31:10.697
But then I punch myself in the dick
and get over it.

31:10.768 --> 31:13.328
- I can go for four more.
- Really?

31:13.404 --> 31:14.632
Come on, Jordan. Keep up.

31:15.073 --> 31:17.473
Craig, do you have some sunscreen?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.375
Relax. Sunburn is full of vitamin D.

31:20.478 --> 31:23.072
- Guys! It's Davis!
- Totally!

31:23.314 --> 31:25.305
- D-Bone!
- Hey, big guy!

31:25.416 --> 31:26.576
Fellas.

31:26.651 --> 31:27.811
What's up, bro?

31:28.586 --> 31:31.180
Offspring. New guy.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.280
What's up, man?

31:32.357 --> 31:33.915
- Everybody good?
- Yeah, man.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.825
So, D-Biscuit, haven't seen you
hanging around. Where you been?

31:36.895 --> 31:39.762
- Costa Rica, bro.
- Central America, classic.

31:39.831 --> 31:40.855
I had to do some work.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.024
- Really?
- Working it.

31:42.133 --> 31:45.000
- "Work!"
- This lucky bastard's a surf photographer,

31:45.069 --> 31:46.866
- travels all over.
- Sweet.

31:47.805 --> 31:49.102
What?

31:51.175 --> 31:53.109
Costa Rica.

31:56.481 --> 31:58.972
The mountains of Costa Rica.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.642
Whoa! Whoa!

32:00.852 --> 32:02.012
That's classified.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.452
Gotta watch it, Davis.
That one looks like a wife.

32:04.522 --> 32:05.580
She got "wife eyes."

32:05.957 --> 32:08.323
"Girlfriend tits," but definitely "wife eyes."

32:08.393 --> 32:10.588
I've got to get better pictures on my phone.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.027
Your phone ain't the problem, bro.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.656
Come on. You guys are the ones
living the real dream.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.723
I will <i>Freaky Friday</i> with you anytime.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.766
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, Patel, what's the Camaro situation?

32:19.871 --> 32:22.237
- You ready to sell that bad boy or what?
- Never.

32:22.307 --> 32:23.433
- Never?
- Yeah.

32:23.508 --> 32:25.305
Ask him when was the last time he drove it.

32:25.376 --> 32:26.809
Plus, you can't even get
a car seat in that thing.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.843
Patel's wife wants him to trade in
his '69 Camaro.

32:30.181 --> 32:32.240
We have bets on how long he can last.

32:32.317 --> 32:35.809
Gabriel, I understand you've embraced
the minivan, and that's your journey,

32:35.887 --> 32:39.516
but I don't want to drive a vagina on wheels.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.624
My vagina seats seven, comfortably.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.093
I've been in it a million times.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.858
Plus, Patel test drove a minivan
last week anyway.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.398
- What?
- So?

32:48.666 --> 32:49.826
That doesn't mean anything!

32:49.901 --> 32:52.233
I look at houses with Holly,
but we're not buying one.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.163
- Bro, bro, bro.
- What?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.868
When your wife says
you're just test driving minivans,

32:58.943 --> 33:00.205
you're buying a minivan.

33:00.311 --> 33:02.336
And when she says
you're just looking at houses,

33:02.413 --> 33:03.971
- you're buying a house.
- No, I'm not.

33:04.048 --> 33:05.606
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm not buying a house.

33:05.683 --> 33:06.877
Check your receipts.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.680
Welcome to escrow, bitch.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.021
No, thank you. Have the Breast Day!

33:13.191 --> 33:15.056
Janice! Janice!

33:15.126 --> 33:17.117
- You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

33:17.195 --> 33:19.857
You are looking at
one of the keynote speakers

33:19.931 --> 33:22.399
at the next regional ABC Kids Expo.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.334
- Shut up! No!
- Yes!

33:25.470 --> 33:27.131
You're living your wisdom!

33:27.205 --> 33:28.297
I know!

33:28.373 --> 33:30.568
- She's speaking at the Expo!
- I'm speaking at the Expo!

33:30.875 --> 33:35.642
<i>At the Expo, about the breast pump</i>
<i>And the lactation</i>

33:43.321 --> 33:44.845
Sorry, I just... Sorry.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.317
No more cell phones.
Landlines only from here on out.

33:47.392 --> 33:51.624
I am protecting my miracle.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.357
Actually, that was my cell phone.

34:05.276 --> 34:08.609
Hey, guys. I'm sorry.
Can I just borrow Alex for two secs?

34:08.679 --> 34:09.976
- What?
- This is it!

34:10.047 --> 34:11.310
- Already?
- Yes!

34:11.382 --> 34:12.940
It's supposed to be a year. Or more!

34:13.184 --> 34:16.085
<i>You got lucky. I'm sending his pictures now.</i>

34:16.154 --> 34:18.520
<i>His name is Kaleb, he's six weeks old.</i>

34:19.257 --> 34:22.851
<i>We don't have any family medical history</i>
<i>and probably never will</i>

34:22.927 --> 34:26.021
<i>so you two will need to consider</i>
<i>whether that'll be an issue for you.</i>

34:26.130 --> 34:27.597
- Well...
- It's not!

34:31.135 --> 34:32.795
- Okay. It's not.
- It's not.

34:32.870 --> 34:35.100
<i>Great, I'll leave you to it.</i>

34:39.777 --> 34:44.179
Oh, my God! Alex, look at him!
He's gorgeous!

34:44.514 --> 34:46.107
Can you feel it?

34:47.552 --> 34:49.746
We're gonna be a family.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.415
Oh, yeah. Real soon.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.458
- Here, let's take a picture by the sign.
- All right.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.392
Okay, make sure you get the sign
and the house.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.762
And us.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.537
It's a boy.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.973
- Wow!
- Honey!

35:12.577 --> 35:14.704
I just peed myself a little.

35:19.317 --> 35:20.477
A girl.

35:20.551 --> 35:22.678
- Yes!
- A mini-me!

35:26.290 --> 35:29.054
- We want it to be a surprise.
- It's okay. We don't have to say.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.221
Evan, I'm pregnant. That's surprise enough.
We wanna know.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.456
It's a boy.

35:33.531 --> 35:37.262
A boy! That's so cute! I love boys!

35:37.435 --> 35:40.029
It looks like it's a little early to tell.

35:42.106 --> 35:43.573
That's okay.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.410
She looks good.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.671
- It's a boy, Dad.
- Well...

35:50.948 --> 35:53.849
He kinda looks like
the Loch Ness Monster to me,

35:53.918 --> 35:55.579
but I'll take your word for it.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.313
He's beautiful, y'all.

35:57.855 --> 35:59.447
- Thank you.
- Now I will see your baby,

36:01.092 --> 36:03.526
and raise you one more.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.196
Twins!

36:09.534 --> 36:10.865
Twins.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.300
- Oh, my goodness! So great!
- God.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.539
Can you believe it? Two!

36:15.606 --> 36:17.005
Two <i>número unos.</i>

36:17.241 --> 36:19.937
- And you got the 4-D ultrasound video.
- Yeah.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.844
Don't you kinda wish you'd done it now?
I offered to pay for it.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.807
So, who wants dessert?

36:24.882 --> 36:27.373
I do! Park it here.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.479
- I don't know if you take it right off...
- What? Maybe you don't.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.887
- Take it easy.
- Wow!

36:33.724 --> 36:36.693
Two! Two <i>número unos!</i>

36:36.761 --> 36:38.626
Holy shit!

36:39.997 --> 36:41.828
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop!

36:41.899 --> 36:42.923
All right, turn to the side.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.759
Flash me the belly. I want to see it. Come on.

36:47.104 --> 36:48.503
I know. I'm finally starting to show.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.772
- I'm gonna take one every week.
- Nice.

36:50.841 --> 36:52.206
- Watch you two grow.
- That's a good one.

36:52.276 --> 36:53.641
That's a good one, huh?

36:54.145 --> 36:55.578
Little peanut.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.014
I'm really glad you're here.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.017
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:01.085 --> 37:03.212
Where else would I be?

37:17.101 --> 37:19.433
Marco? Wake up.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.665
I'm bleeding.

37:50.034 --> 37:56.940
<i>Reminding, rewinding</i>
<i>Removing, regretting</i>

37:59.543 --> 38:01.135
<i>Forgetting</i>

38:03.514 --> 38:10.317
<i>Your smiles at the wake and</i>
<i>Your tears at the wedding</i>

38:12.923 --> 38:15.221

38:16.894 --> 38:19.055

<i>Forgetting</i>

38:44.021 --> 38:45.750
<i>Forgetting</i>

39:19.123 --> 39:20.784
It's my fault. I wished it.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.827
Don't say that. It's not your fault. Okay?

39:26.163 --> 39:28.256
I never even felt it kick.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.495
Congratulations. You're off the hook.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.872
Rosie, don't say that. Come on. Hey!

39:39.510 --> 39:41.068
Hey!

39:43.948 --> 39:45.245
Rosie, hey!

39:48.285 --> 39:50.515
We're not a couple.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.751
We've never even been on a real date,
you know.

39:54.492 --> 39:56.960
I think we can do ourselves a favor
and stop pretending.

39:57.027 --> 39:59.689
Rosie! Hey, it's me!

40:00.464 --> 40:02.329
Tequila shots! Don't judge.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.593
Shit, Ro. You okay?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.797
- Yeah, I want to get inside.
- Come on.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.013
<i>Fighting fit.</i>

40:27.358 --> 40:29.849
All right, that's perfect. Let's see the bump.
That's great.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.155
- Turn to your right.
- Can we hurry this up?

40:31.228 --> 40:32.354
He's pushing on my bladder.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.954
Great. All right. We got it.

40:34.031 --> 40:35.328
Okay, but did you get my rack?

40:35.399 --> 40:37.765
Because I am gonna need evidence
that I had these.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.166
- We've got proof.
- You got it? Okay.

40:39.236 --> 40:40.430
Yeah. That's great. Thanks, Jules.

40:40.504 --> 40:42.404
- Jules, that was great.
- Thank you.

40:42.473 --> 40:44.498
We are so excited to have you
as our Spring cover mom.

40:44.575 --> 40:45.599
Me, too.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.710
Listen, can we just try to keep it positive?

40:47.778 --> 40:49.143
You know, there's a lot of articles out there

40:49.213 --> 40:52.114
that make women over 35 who are pregnant
feel like crap.

40:52.349 --> 40:53.680
- Right.
- And I just don't want...

40:53.751 --> 40:56.549
- No, it's gonna be so...
- Sorry, I've got to take this.

40:58.589 --> 41:00.250
Hey, you. Did you watch it?

41:00.357 --> 41:03.417
That circumcision video you sent me?
Give me a little heads up next time.

41:03.527 --> 41:05.324
I was eating lunch. Now I'm scarred for life.

41:05.463 --> 41:09.422
Yeah, gross! Nobody needs to see
how the sausage gets made, Jules!

41:09.767 --> 41:12.201
I'm not gonna let somebody
hurt my baby like that.

41:12.269 --> 41:14.533
<i>Jules, trust me.</i>
<i>He's not even gonna remember it.</i>

41:15.206 --> 41:16.935
It's not even medically necessary.

41:17.007 --> 41:20.272
And besides, it actually makes the penis
less sensitive.

41:20.344 --> 41:23.507
That's why you do it. Give the kid
some endurance, a fighting chance.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.276
He's perfect as he is. I don't get the point.
What is it?

41:27.251 --> 41:28.684
Because I'm Jewish?

41:29.286 --> 41:33.086
Half Jewish.
Christmas tree Jewish, that's what you said.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.557
But my penis is full Jew.
This is my jurisdiction.

41:35.626 --> 41:38.026
Okay, so I have no say in
what happens to my son?

41:38.996 --> 41:42.762
Besides, if you had your foreskin,
maybe I would like you a little bit more.

41:42.833 --> 41:43.925
How much more?

41:44.001 --> 41:45.764
A tip more.

41:46.470 --> 41:50.998
Look, I would feel shafted if we didn't do it.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.009
Can we discuss this weirdness later?
I'm working.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.806
Okay.

41:54.879 --> 41:55.971
I love you. Bye.

41:56.046 --> 41:57.240
Love you, too.

41:58.182 --> 42:01.015
Well, if it's any consolation,
I like an uncut guy.

42:02.052 --> 42:04.646
Yeah, I once banged my way
straight across Eastern Europe.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.417
It was fun.

42:06.757 --> 42:09.726
I don't know, man. Out of the blue,
I got this call and suddenly...

42:09.793 --> 42:11.192
- Jordan!
...we got this baby.

42:11.262 --> 42:12.923
- That's right, you got a baby.
- It's not good.

42:13.030 --> 42:16.625
They said it was gonna be
at least a year or more, all right?

42:16.700 --> 42:19.828
And that's the one thing you can count on
with adoption, right? Time.

42:21.739 --> 42:24.299
I need that time to save, to get ready.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.865
There's no such thing as ready.

42:25.943 --> 42:28.503
You just jump on a moving train
and try not to die.

42:28.946 --> 42:31.244
- Great.
- What's up, man? You terrified?

42:31.315 --> 42:33.044
Because you should be.

42:33.117 --> 42:35.585
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get to the hospital room.

42:35.653 --> 42:39.714
And she's gonna be laying there
with her legs splayed wide open.

42:39.957 --> 42:41.948
My woman gave birth doggie-style.

42:43.727 --> 42:45.456
They can do that, you know.

42:45.529 --> 42:48.464
And then out is gonna slide a little miracle.

42:48.532 --> 42:52.628
Half you, half her, your DNA all mixed
together in one magical baby cocktail.

42:52.703 --> 42:54.295
The best day of your life.

42:54.371 --> 42:56.202
That's sweet, but Alex here is adopting.

42:57.441 --> 42:59.341
Yeah, do it that way. No fuss, no muss.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.002
Come on, Jordan!

43:03.247 --> 43:05.442
- What if he hates me?
- He will.

43:05.516 --> 43:08.383
I mean, what if he tries to kill me
in my sleep when he's 15?

43:08.452 --> 43:10.249
Well, then I guess
you're not a very good father.

43:10.354 --> 43:12.288
That's normal.
That's like every Greek tragedy.

43:12.356 --> 43:13.482
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.

43:13.557 --> 43:15.354
I'm serious, okay? I need help.

43:15.492 --> 43:16.584
Dude, you're gonna be fine.

43:16.660 --> 43:18.924
You've just got to get over
your fear of babies. They can smell fear.

43:19.496 --> 43:20.827
Like bears or wives.

43:20.898 --> 43:22.695
You need some practice.
Here, hold Henry for a second.

43:22.766 --> 43:23.994
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Do not do that.

43:24.068 --> 43:26.093
- Do not touch his baby!
- Shut up!

43:26.170 --> 43:28.195
That kid is a grenade, and he will go off.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.536
You know what, start with Evander here.
She never cries.

43:30.674 --> 43:31.766
No, I'm cool, thank you.

43:31.842 --> 43:34.208
She fell off the changing table last week,
didn't make a sound.

43:34.545 --> 43:36.740
You dropped your kid off a changing table?

43:37.414 --> 43:39.006
How was that even possible?

43:39.216 --> 43:40.274
It's very possible.

43:40.351 --> 43:43.343
It's much more common than you think.
But you know what? Rule number two...

43:43.420 --> 43:44.910
- We don't judge.
- No judging.

43:45.122 --> 43:48.614
Stuffjust happens, okay?
Last week my kid ate a cigarette.

43:48.692 --> 43:50.660
I caught him playing in the dryer yesterday.

43:50.728 --> 43:52.127
I picked up the wrong baby from day care.

43:52.196 --> 43:53.891
Found my baby swimming in the toilet.

43:53.964 --> 43:57.331
And for the record,
the roll-off did not happen on my watch.

43:57.401 --> 43:59.369
- Dodged a bullet.
- No judging.

43:59.436 --> 44:01.870
- Come on. Come on.
- No, really, that's okay.

44:01.939 --> 44:04.032
- Come on. Come on. Here you go!
- That's all right.

44:04.274 --> 44:05.741
Good catch.

44:07.611 --> 44:08.635
Take her back.

44:08.812 --> 44:09.836
Take her back!

44:10.114 --> 44:12.708
I hope that adoption agency
has a return policy.

44:12.783 --> 44:15.149
Big help, guys. Glad I came out.

44:15.986 --> 44:17.351
It's Davis!

44:18.489 --> 44:20.286
Davis! Davis! Davis!

44:20.391 --> 44:22.359
- Yeah, bro!
- D-Bone!

44:22.459 --> 44:23.551
- What is up?
- Boom.

44:23.627 --> 44:26.562
S'up fellas, kids, Jordan!

44:29.266 --> 44:31.257
Dude, this kid is like Mickey Rourke
in <i>The Wrestler.</i>

44:31.468 --> 44:34.869
I wish he was that well behaved.
He's more like Mickey Rourke in real life.

44:36.707 --> 44:37.935
So tall.

44:38.008 --> 44:39.532
- Been working out?
- Yeah.

44:39.610 --> 44:43.239
I missed out on high fives before.
I'll take one if you had a spare.

44:45.149 --> 44:46.946
- I got you, Craig.
- Thank you.

44:47.284 --> 44:49.479
- Sorry, Davis.
- All right, I'm out of here.

44:52.222 --> 44:53.689
Nice job, Craig.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.576
Kara, what time is it?

45:20.818 --> 45:23.184
I've got 20 minutes to make it
to the crib sale at Babies "R" Us.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.518
I've been totally cracking out on baby stuff.

45:25.723 --> 45:29.215
Sneaker-socks.
I've got my 2-in-1 swing rocker.

45:31.528 --> 45:33.689
What is with the face?

45:33.764 --> 45:36.096
Holly, I'm sorry to tell you this

45:36.667 --> 45:38.965
but we just had our budget meeting,

45:39.036 --> 45:41.129
and I don't know
that we're renewing your contract.

45:41.672 --> 45:45.631
I've got to cut down on all my freelancers.
You were the last one hired.

45:47.778 --> 45:49.712
Wait. But this is my main job.

45:51.448 --> 45:53.439
We're about to close on the house.

45:53.751 --> 45:58.415
I'm doing what I can to keep you,
but it just isn't looking good.

46:10.701 --> 46:11.895
Okay.

46:11.969 --> 46:13.527
- Don't hate me.
- No.

46:18.142 --> 46:19.734
Do me a favor?

46:20.744 --> 46:24.009
Don't tell Alex
until I can find something else. Okay?

46:24.581 --> 46:25.639
Okay.

46:26.650 --> 46:27.912
Okay.

46:28.185 --> 46:29.675
- I'm sorry.
- No.

46:31.321 --> 46:35.223
And reach! And push.
Okay now, break starfish formation.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.489
Let's get back in position.
I want opposite sets. Crunch it up.

46:38.562 --> 46:40.757
I want 10 of those on each side.
That's 20, people.

46:40.931 --> 46:43.456
And I need a minute.
And don't think I won't be watching you.

46:43.534 --> 46:44.626
Keep it moving.

46:45.269 --> 46:49.569
"I'm Not Circumcising My Baby."
Well done. Well done. Front page.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.007
Okay, look, I was gonna tell you.
I did not say this to them.

46:53.076 --> 46:56.341
They overheard our private conversation.
I would never talk to them about us.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.811
Why is this such a big deal to you?

46:57.881 --> 47:00.372
Because I don't think that it's right.
And I'm his mother.

47:00.450 --> 47:03.510
And I'm his father.
Parenthood is about compromise.

47:03.587 --> 47:05.418
- Well, then compromise, Evan.
- I have.

47:05.622 --> 47:08.489
I stay at your place.
We spend the holidays with your family.

47:08.725 --> 47:11.091
Yeah, but I have sacrificed
my entire body for this.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.890
So that means
you just get to win every argument?

47:12.963 --> 47:15.523
No, that means that in every relationship...

47:15.599 --> 47:18.067
What are you guys doing?
Come on! Pick it up!

47:19.303 --> 47:21.897
In every relationship,
there's an alpha and a beta.

47:21.972 --> 47:23.064
- And I'm the alpha.
- And I'm the alpha.

47:23.140 --> 47:25.165
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!

47:25.242 --> 47:26.334
Jinx.

47:30.214 --> 47:33.411
You know, I'm just gonna
stay at my place tonight.

47:36.787 --> 47:40.188
Hey, Jules! If you're interested,
I never got snipped.

47:55.138 --> 47:56.901
<i>Only one star</i>
<i>on the tango last week, Megan,</i>

47:56.974 --> 47:58.703
<i>but the samba's still to come.</i>
<i>How do you feel?</i>

47:58.775 --> 48:00.800
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't really care about the trophy.</i>

48:00.878 --> 48:02.175
<i>I'm here for Evan.</i>

<i>Right, Papa-daddy?</i>

48:04.147 --> 48:06.741
<i>Evan has promised</i>
<i>he's gonna knock me up next.</i>

48:06.917 --> 48:08.009
<i>She's kidding, Jules.</i>

48:08.085 --> 48:10.576
<i>No, I'm not, Jules.</i>
<i>We're gonna be sister-wives!</i>

48:22.766 --> 48:24.961
Why don't you take a break. I have this.

48:25.035 --> 48:26.559
Thanks.

48:37.381 --> 48:40.179
Okay E-invite, draft 38.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.308
Okay.

48:41.385 --> 48:45.617
"Let's shower Wendy and Gary Cooper
with light and love

48:45.689 --> 48:48.123
"to honor the arrival of their Mini Cooper."

48:48.191 --> 48:49.453
That's cute.

48:49.526 --> 48:53.690
And then I put a picture of a Mini Cooper

48:54.731 --> 48:55.857
at the end.

48:55.933 --> 48:56.957
Where did you get the picture?

48:57.034 --> 48:59.025
I stole it from the Internet.

49:01.138 --> 49:04.904
Wendy, shut your pregnant face.
You do not want to see this.

49:07.477 --> 49:10.935
It's okay. She's my mother-in-law-ish.
Shit, hi!

49:11.381 --> 49:12.780
Wendy, hi!

49:12.849 --> 49:14.908
Skyler, hi!

49:14.985 --> 49:16.111
Look at our bellies.

49:16.186 --> 49:18.814
We are like twins!
Except I'm actually having twins.

49:19.056 --> 49:23.891
You really love to remind me about that
every time. Hi.

49:24.161 --> 49:26.527
I just came by to personally invite y'all
to our baby shower.

49:26.930 --> 49:30.422
Wow, this is your shower invite.

49:31.468 --> 49:35.268
Look, I know that Ramsey and Gary have not
always gotten along so well

49:35.339 --> 49:36.897
but we are family. Okay?

49:36.974 --> 49:39.374
And it would just mean the world to me
if y'all came.

49:39.476 --> 49:42.707
Of course, Skyler. That's... You...

49:44.748 --> 49:45.772
Wow!

49:45.983 --> 49:47.109
What is it?

49:49.286 --> 49:52.380
It's Mini Coopers.

49:53.256 --> 49:54.280
Beep beep!

49:54.624 --> 49:56.990
Beep beep! Beep beep...

49:59.329 --> 50:02.560
You know, because there's two of them
and there's two in here, and they're pink.

50:02.699 --> 50:03.893
Yeah.

50:04.001 --> 50:06.663
So, Skyler, seven months.
How are you feeling?

50:07.237 --> 50:09.865
With the side effects, you know.
Because I know that

50:10.474 --> 50:13.637
at this point in the pregnancy, acne and

50:13.710 --> 50:17.441
bleeding gums, constipation,
it's all totally normal. Totally normal.

50:17.848 --> 50:20.817
When my sister was pregnant,
she got herpes.

50:21.151 --> 50:23.779
No, that's... She didn't get...
Not from being pregnant.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.550
No, I feel so whole.

50:26.923 --> 50:31.587
You know? And just feminine.
With all this life running through me.

50:31.661 --> 50:35.324
I felt the exact same way
when I had my phantom pregnancy.

50:37.067 --> 50:38.125
Don't pay attention to her.

50:38.568 --> 50:41.833
But, yeah, I mean, I just... It's beautiful.

50:41.905 --> 50:44.465
But what am I saying?
You know exactly what this is like.

50:44.775 --> 50:46.037
Totally.

50:46.410 --> 50:49.436
Well, I just came
to drop off that little invitation.

50:49.513 --> 50:51.310
And I'm gonna go to my pregger 'lates.

50:51.581 --> 50:53.572
Sounds pregger-ific.

50:54.351 --> 50:56.080
- All right, one more time.
- Bring it in.

50:56.153 --> 50:57.620
Okay. I'll see y'all there?

50:57.687 --> 51:00.281
- Yes, I will tell Gary.
- Okay. Thank you.

51:00.357 --> 51:01.824
- Yeah.
- Okay.

51:02.359 --> 51:04.122
Hey, Wendy,
do you mind if I take one of these?

51:04.194 --> 51:06.822
- What's that?
- Holly Castillo Photography.

51:06.897 --> 51:10.025
Ramsey's been on me about getting
one of these pregnancy portraits done, so...

51:10.267 --> 51:14.363
Well, Holly's the best,
so she'll make you look amazing-er.

51:14.671 --> 51:15.695
Bye.

51:15.939 --> 51:17.998
Bye. Bye.

51:18.642 --> 51:19.700
Bye!

51:20.911 --> 51:24.677
I mean, look at her. No cellulite.
Not even in daylight.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.610
She's wearing six-inch heels.

51:26.850 --> 51:29.546
God, she's like
a magical pregnancy unicorn.

51:29.619 --> 51:31.917
Gary is gonna shit a sideways brick
when he sees this.

51:34.091 --> 51:37.959
Hey, come on! We started Mini Cooper.
That's our thing.

51:38.495 --> 51:39.792
We own it, right?

51:39.896 --> 51:41.796
<i>All right! Thank you.</i>
<i>Hey, a little heads up, America.</i>

51:41.865 --> 51:43.423
- Do we have to watch this?
- Yes.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.401
<i>While we send these four home to train</i>
<i>on their own before our live finale</i>

51:46.470 --> 51:50.065
<i>some of our previous seasons' contestants</i>
<i>are going to get a little surprise.</i>

51:50.540 --> 51:52.906
<i>That's right. I'm gonna be dropping in</i>
<i>on some of you guys</i>

51:52.976 --> 51:55.877
<i>to see how you're keeping the weight off.</i>
<i>You've been warned.</i>

51:58.548 --> 52:01.108
They can't get someone else to fly around
and do these interviews?

52:01.384 --> 52:03.477
I don't like you traveling this late.

52:03.553 --> 52:06.113
Nobody's asking you to stop doing your job.

52:06.189 --> 52:08.157
Besides, these are my contestants, Evan.

52:08.225 --> 52:11.353
I was there when they lost the weight
and I want to be there for them now.

52:11.428 --> 52:15.296
You're pushing yourself too hard, Jules.
Especially at your age.

52:15.398 --> 52:18.834
Wow! Thanks. That's super-supportive.
I appreciate that.

52:18.902 --> 52:20.733
What, I'm not even
supposed to mention reality?

52:20.837 --> 52:25.774
I am healthy. I have a low blood pressure.
Not that you're helping me any.

52:25.842 --> 52:28.504
Look, I just think someone should
go with you and little Jackson there.

52:28.578 --> 52:30.307
Well, you know what, I have my crew,

52:30.413 --> 52:32.973
and you are welcome to leave your show
and come along.

52:33.083 --> 52:34.607
And we are not naming him Jackson.

52:34.684 --> 52:36.049
You liked it last week.

52:36.119 --> 52:39.418
Obviously you caught me
in a moment of weakness.

52:39.489 --> 52:42.049
Honestly, God, seriously, I sometimes think

52:42.159 --> 52:45.253
that it would just be so much easier
if I could do this on my own.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.455
Really? You think that?

52:48.765 --> 52:49.959
Come on.

52:50.033 --> 52:52.627
Evan, we danced on a show
for three months together

52:52.702 --> 52:55.170
and suddenly we're supposed to
agree on everything?

52:55.305 --> 52:58.103
Fine. Why don't you make every decision
about our child's entire life

52:58.175 --> 53:00.643
and just send me an email
when you've got it figured out.

53:10.487 --> 53:11.977
Why do you do that, Jules?

53:13.490 --> 53:16.721
I know you've been busting ass with work
and getting everything ready for the baby.

53:16.793 --> 53:18.021
- I just wanted to...
- Alex, about work.

53:18.094 --> 53:19.186
- There's something that came up...
- No, no!

53:19.262 --> 53:22.288
No shop talk tonight, all right?

53:22.365 --> 53:23.798
I just want to remind you

53:23.900 --> 53:27.199
that even though we're gonna be parents,
we can still kick it old school. All right?

53:27.270 --> 53:29.363
Alex and Holly style.

53:31.107 --> 53:33.905
Surprise!

53:34.844 --> 53:37.005
Happy Baby Shower, bitches!

53:41.451 --> 53:45.148
<i>Might as well face it</i>
<i>You're addicted to love</i>

53:46.122 --> 53:49.285
Listen to that. Someone call the cops.
They're murdering a song.

53:49.359 --> 53:50.553
- I know, it hurts.
- Literally.

53:50.627 --> 53:53.061
<i>I love it when you call me Big Poppa</i>

53:53.129 --> 53:56.292
<i>Throw your hands in the air</i>
<i>If you're a true player</i>

53:56.366 --> 53:58.561
<i>I love it when you call me Big Poppa</i>

53:58.768 --> 54:00.827
- We should have another baby.
- Oh, yeah!

54:00.904 --> 54:03.338
Come on, you gonna sweat that
weave out tonight.

54:03.440 --> 54:05.601
We got our twins.
Let's go for triplets, all right?

54:05.842 --> 54:08.310
No, no, no, that's baby juice!

54:12.449 --> 54:13.473
To us.

54:13.550 --> 54:15.211
To actually getting Rosie out of the house!

54:15.285 --> 54:17.549
In something other than
stained pajama pants.

54:33.970 --> 54:35.301
I'll be right back.

54:36.305 --> 54:42.247
