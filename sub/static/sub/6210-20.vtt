WEBVTT

00:02.267 --> 00:03.535
Hey, look at all the stuff

00:03.536 --> 00:05.069
from the Other Realm.

00:05.070 --> 00:07.905
Hey, I got a letter
from my pen pal Martha.

00:07.906 --> 00:09.474
Oh, this is for you
from the Witches' Council

00:09.475 --> 00:10.475
accounting office.

00:10.476 --> 00:12.010
Our Christmas presents
from Mom.

00:12.011 --> 00:13.678
But Christmas
was four months ago.

00:13.679 --> 00:15.514
Yes, she's early this year.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.715
This is wonderful.
They made a clerical error.

00:17.716 --> 00:21.386
I thought I had six lives left,
but it turns out I have nine.

00:21.387 --> 00:22.687
That seems fair.

00:22.688 --> 00:24.589
You have nine,
Mother Teresa got the one.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.924
This means I can start living
more dangerously.

00:26.925 --> 00:28.860
Hello, X Games.

00:28.861 --> 00:29.994
What did you get?

00:29.995 --> 00:33.765
A locket with a tiny
nuclear reactor inside.

00:33.766 --> 00:34.766
What did you get?

00:34.767 --> 00:37.035
A gift certificate
for ball bearings.

00:37.036 --> 00:38.302
Really?
Oh, yeah,

00:38.303 --> 00:39.738
but it's actually
quite personal.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.373
She filled it in herself
in her lovely chicken scratch.

00:42.374 --> 00:44.309
Martha wants me to visit her.
Would that be okay?

00:44.310 --> 00:45.977
No.

00:45.978 --> 00:48.513
I don't want to be the only
miserable person in the room.

00:48.514 --> 00:50.215
Of course you can.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.184
Hooray,
the toast is stuck.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.585
Danger, here I come.

00:55.554 --> 00:56.888
Careful.
You might touch a coil--

00:56.889 --> 00:58.857
( electrical buzzing )

00:58.858 --> 00:59.958
Are you all right?

00:59.959 --> 01:02.293
Fine...

01:02.294 --> 01:03.528
for an appliance.

01:03.529 --> 01:05.296
Great.
You burnt my toast.

01:11.170 --> 01:13.104
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.883 --> 01:27.419
I find this the only
acceptable form of dribbling.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.259
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

01:34.260 --> 01:35.760
What happened
to Mr. Kraft's office?

01:35.761 --> 01:37.962
Some kids filled his desk
up with manure again.

01:37.963 --> 01:39.030
Ugh.

01:43.636 --> 01:44.969
Happy anniversary.

01:44.970 --> 01:45.936
What?

01:45.937 --> 01:47.338
Well, it was
two years ago today

01:47.339 --> 01:49.274
that I saw you across
a crowded hallway

01:49.275 --> 01:51.276
and felt a twinge
in my heart.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.845
And then you hit me
on the head with a football.

01:53.846 --> 01:56.080
I wasn't as smooth
when I was a freshman.

01:56.081 --> 01:57.515
Is this a--?

01:57.516 --> 01:58.616
Yup.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.251
It's a genuine diamond chip.

02:00.986 --> 02:02.119
Pretty smooth, huh?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.587
Oh, I'll keep it forever.

02:06.325 --> 02:07.591
Spellman, Kinkle,

02:07.592 --> 02:10.394
into the cafeteria
for fingerprinting.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.430
Are you sure you know
how to fingerprint?

02:12.431 --> 02:14.232
Yeah,
should ink burn?

02:14.233 --> 02:15.533
Just last night

02:15.534 --> 02:19.403
I completed a private
detective course as evidenced

02:19.404 --> 02:22.874
by this emerald
graduation tie clip.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.810
"Dick."
That's right, mister.

02:26.812 --> 02:28.313
And I'm using
my newfound techniques

02:28.314 --> 02:29.447
to get to the bottom

02:29.448 --> 02:31.550
of this school's
vandalism problem.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.650
From now on,

02:32.651 --> 02:36.587
nothing gets by
Willard Kraft, PI.

02:40.893 --> 02:44.462
Wow, Martha, what a beautiful
library you've got here.

02:45.697 --> 02:46.831
Martha?

02:46.832 --> 02:47.965
MARTHA:
Oh, um--

02:47.966 --> 02:49.967
Well, actually
the library belongs

02:49.968 --> 02:52.704
to the Association of
Other Realm Book Borrowers.

02:52.705 --> 02:53.838
I'm...

02:53.839 --> 02:56.508
I'm just merely
one of the minions.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.309
Boy, brag, brag, brag.

02:59.879 --> 03:02.246
You know,
you are so funny.

03:02.247 --> 03:03.748
When I read your letters

03:03.749 --> 03:07.385
sometimes I laugh so hard,
I make a sound.

03:07.386 --> 03:09.787
Well, then you're gonna love
my syndicated column.

03:11.123 --> 03:12.890
You've gotta come visit me.

03:12.891 --> 03:15.025
You've gotta meet
my friends and family

03:15.026 --> 03:17.261
and teach 'em a thing or two
about appreciating my jokes.

03:17.262 --> 03:19.864
Oh, I-I'm not allowed
in the mortal realm.

03:19.865 --> 03:21.232
I'm a magic-free witch.

03:21.233 --> 03:23.067
I was too timid to use
my powers

03:23.068 --> 03:25.203
and so the Witches' Council
took them away.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.405
Oh, the old "use 'em
or lose 'em" law?

03:27.406 --> 03:29.007
Yeah, if I tried
to go back with you,

03:29.008 --> 03:30.775
then they would just
stop us at the border.

03:30.776 --> 03:33.744
You know, you could turn me
into something small

03:33.745 --> 03:35.013
and then smuggle me back.

03:35.014 --> 03:37.115
I mean, they never
check carryons.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.083
Well, but that would
be too much trouble.

03:39.084 --> 03:40.585
No. No trouble at all.

03:40.586 --> 03:42.686
Would you rather be
a duty-free bottle of scotch

03:42.687 --> 03:43.888
or a pet?

03:43.889 --> 03:46.056
Oh, could I be a cat?

03:46.057 --> 03:47.859
Hey, you're the one ridin'
in the bag.

03:50.128 --> 03:51.428
Hilda, look.

03:51.429 --> 03:53.831
With the added power
of Mother's nuclear necklace,

03:53.832 --> 03:56.968
I'll finally be able
to save time in a bottle.

03:56.969 --> 03:59.037
Oh, that's great. I found
a use for my gift too.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.337
Coaster.

04:01.139 --> 04:02.406
SALEM:
Okay, Sabrina,

04:02.407 --> 04:03.975
light my fire.

04:03.976 --> 04:05.843
Salem, I'm not gonna
launch you.

04:05.844 --> 04:07.812
The neighbors think
we're weird enough already.

04:07.813 --> 04:09.247
How am I gonna
use up some lives

04:09.248 --> 04:10.915
if you people continue
to be hung up

04:10.916 --> 04:13.284
on this "thou shalt
not kill" kick.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.488
Say hi to my pen pal, Martha.

04:17.488 --> 04:19.023
Oh, sharing your secrets
with a cat?

04:19.024 --> 04:20.791
What a change of pace
for you.

04:20.793 --> 04:21.959
( electric sputter )

04:21.959 --> 04:23.261
Hey!

04:23.262 --> 04:24.763
Your finger's suffering
a little jet lag.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.064
It'll be fine in a few hours.

04:26.065 --> 04:29.800
Now, if you don't mind,
expose me to a virus.

04:29.801 --> 04:32.403
Well, sorry, Martha,
we'll try again in the morning.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.005
I'm not coughing up blood.

04:36.074 --> 04:38.209
Aw, you look
so comfortable there

04:38.210 --> 04:40.077
and you didn't attack my feet
at all during the night.

04:44.182 --> 04:46.918
Wow, talk about
your good night's sleep.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.887
Oh.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.488
Oh, my. I--

04:50.489 --> 04:52.757
Oh. Well, it---
It must be all that--

04:52.758 --> 04:54.058
that nervous grooming
that I did.

04:54.059 --> 04:57.027
That black cat kept trying
to goad me into a knife fight.

04:57.028 --> 04:58.263
Well, what do you say
I get dressed

04:58.264 --> 04:59.630
and we go see
a mortal high school?

05:01.166 --> 05:02.566
Oh, you--
You didn't tell me

05:02.567 --> 05:04.168
there were gonna be
other people here.

05:04.169 --> 05:05.269
Oh, well,
I thought the term

05:05.270 --> 05:06.871
"public" high school
implied that.

05:06.872 --> 05:08.873
Hey.
Oh, Harvey,

05:08.874 --> 05:10.207
meet Martha, my pen pal.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.409
Nice to meet you,
Martha.

05:11.410 --> 05:13.044
Where are you from?

05:13.045 --> 05:14.378
Uh, the Other Realm.

05:14.379 --> 05:15.479
Drive.
The Other Realm Drive.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.548
It's in Virginia.

05:17.449 --> 05:18.782
Did you show her
the necklace?

05:18.783 --> 05:20.618
Oh, right. Martha,
look what Harvey gave me.

05:20.619 --> 05:21.719
Where is it?

05:21.720 --> 05:24.289
It's right, um...

05:24.290 --> 05:25.890
Freeze.

05:25.891 --> 05:26.958
I'll be right back.

05:28.660 --> 05:29.794
( sighs )

05:29.795 --> 05:31.262
I can't find
that necklace anywhere.

05:31.263 --> 05:33.398
What am I gonna tell Harvey?

05:35.300 --> 05:37.167
It's at home.

05:37.168 --> 05:38.436
Oh, Spellman, uh,

05:38.437 --> 05:39.704
let me guess,
your friend doesn't

05:39.705 --> 05:41.272
have a visitor's pass.

05:41.273 --> 05:43.141
No, but before society
breaks down completely

05:43.142 --> 05:44.208
I can go get one.

05:44.209 --> 05:45.276
Come on, Martha.
Oh, no.

05:45.277 --> 05:47.144
I-I'm just feeling
a little bit overwhelmed.

05:47.145 --> 05:49.614
I'm going to huddle
by the water fountain,

05:49.615 --> 05:52.416
if you don't mind.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.585
Virginians don't
get out much, do they?

05:54.586 --> 05:55.753
Go on to class.

05:55.754 --> 05:57.722
I will escort your guest
to the office.

05:57.723 --> 05:59.190
But--
( sniffs )

05:59.191 --> 06:02.560
Smell that?
It's the odor of detention.

06:06.665 --> 06:09.166
Are we, uh,
nearsighted, miss?

06:10.603 --> 06:13.237
Oh. My, my.

06:13.238 --> 06:17.041
Is that
an emerald tie clip or--?

06:17.042 --> 06:19.911
Or am I just fixating
on your eyes?

06:21.480 --> 06:23.380
Please!

06:23.381 --> 06:24.549
No, you are not

06:24.550 --> 06:26.484
alligator wrestling
in my living room.

06:26.485 --> 06:28.319
I don't care
how many lives you have,

06:28.320 --> 06:31.188
I don't have time to pick up
cat entrails out of the carpet.

06:31.189 --> 06:32.456
Well, I did it.

06:32.457 --> 06:34.325
I finally settled things
with Mother.

06:34.326 --> 06:36.560
Oh, Hilda, I'm so glad
you talked to her.

06:36.561 --> 06:37.828
Who talked?

06:37.829 --> 06:40.731
I filled her living room
with 2 tons of cracked corn.

06:40.732 --> 06:41.999
Out of my way.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.634
SABRINA:
Mr. Kraft, where's Martha?

06:43.635 --> 06:45.804
Oh, that is
a very good question.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.939
We were enjoying
a skim milk in my office

06:47.940 --> 06:49.407
and she stepped out
to freshen up.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.275
Next thing I know,
the door is locked,

06:51.276 --> 06:53.077
no one is heeding
my screams for help,

06:53.078 --> 06:55.312
and I had to crawl out
through an air duct.

06:55.313 --> 06:56.314
Oh, no.
I better go find her.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.682
She's not very good
in new places.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.450
In case you haven't
noticed, she's shy.

06:59.451 --> 07:01.352
Shy?! Heh.
That woman is a brazen--

07:01.353 --> 07:02.553
( choking )

07:05.257 --> 07:08.359
Oh, wait a minute.
My emerald tie pin.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.161
It's gone.

07:10.162 --> 07:11.529
Call the police!

07:11.530 --> 07:13.064
( gagging )
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

07:13.065 --> 07:15.800
( alarm ringing )

07:52.838 --> 07:54.105
Martha.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.974
Martha, did you come home?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.809
( hammering )

07:57.810 --> 08:00.277
And are you re-shingling
our roof?

08:01.813 --> 08:02.747
There.

08:02.748 --> 08:03.914
I still say
we should have gone

08:03.915 --> 08:05.215
for a good
old-fashioned moat.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.319
Redecorating?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.687
No, a dangerous jewel thief

08:09.688 --> 08:11.322
has escaped
from the Other Realm.

08:11.323 --> 08:13.091
( thunder crashes )

08:13.092 --> 08:14.525
Oh, a wanted poster.

08:14.526 --> 08:16.327
Oh, I hate
artist renderings.

08:16.328 --> 08:18.462
They all look like Doodles
Weaver in a stocking cap.

08:18.463 --> 08:19.564
Hey, if you squint,

08:19.565 --> 08:21.399
this guy kind of looks
like my pen pal.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.167
Really?
Yeah, but it can't be Martha.

08:23.168 --> 08:24.535
She's way too nice...

08:25.637 --> 08:27.705
HILDA:
Jewels!

08:27.706 --> 08:29.640
...for an extremely
dangerous criminal.

08:34.479 --> 08:36.948
So then I sort of turned her
into a cat and brought her home.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.650
And having to smuggle her
didn't strike you as odd?

08:39.650 --> 08:41.485
When you say "smuggle,"
it just sounds bad.

08:41.486 --> 08:44.522
You signed up for a pen pal
with a capital P.

08:44.523 --> 08:47.825
A pen pal with a capital P
means a pal in the penitentiary.

08:47.826 --> 08:49.360
Everyone knows that.

08:49.361 --> 08:51.328
I bet I could round up
a few people who don't.

08:52.564 --> 08:53.698
She was working in the library.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.199
The most dangerous criminals

08:55.200 --> 08:57.268
are always forced
to shelve books.

08:57.269 --> 08:58.802
Keeps bloodshed
to a minimum.

08:58.803 --> 09:00.404
( Salem yelling )

09:00.405 --> 09:02.306
She's got Salem.

09:02.307 --> 09:03.474
Wah-jah!

09:04.777 --> 09:05.944
What are you doing?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.845
Expressing sheer delight.

09:07.846 --> 09:10.014
I'm making a type of sushi
known as fugu.

09:10.015 --> 09:13.718
If it's not prepared
exactly right, it can be lethal.

09:13.719 --> 09:14.919
Hope, hope.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.020
WOMAN ( over TV ):
<i>We interrupt</i>

09:16.021 --> 09:17.354
Hey, Let's Wrap Things
in Seaweed

09:17.355 --> 09:18.856
<i>for a special bulletin.</i>

09:18.857 --> 09:22.326
Hot dog. I'm gonna miss
how to de-vein the poison sac.

09:22.327 --> 09:23.961
<i>There have been</i>
<i>a rash of jewel robberies</i>

09:23.962 --> 09:26.063
<i>reported</i>
<i>in the Westbridge area.</i>

09:26.064 --> 09:26.930
<i>That's right.</i>

09:26.931 --> 09:27.966
<i>It was</i>
<i>an emerald tie clip</i>

09:27.967 --> 09:29.300
<i>and-- And beware,</i>

09:29.301 --> 09:31.402
<i>the thief may be trying</i>
<i>to pass himself off</i>

09:31.403 --> 09:33.404
<i>as a licensed</i>
<i>private eye</i>

09:33.405 --> 09:35.105
<i>or a member</i>
<i>of the Lions Club.</i>

09:35.106 --> 09:38.108
WOMAN:
<i>She's been seen talking</i>
<i>to a blond accomplice.</i>

09:38.109 --> 09:39.743
A blond accomplice?
Oh, no!

09:39.744 --> 09:41.045
( thudding )

09:41.046 --> 09:42.947
<i>...reporting live</i>
<i>from Westbridge High School.</i>

09:42.948 --> 09:46.217
Those three run way too much.

09:47.218 --> 09:48.452
Ah, too late.

09:48.453 --> 09:50.721
Your pen pal's gone
with the goods.

09:50.722 --> 09:53.691
Okay, I admit it.
I misjudged her.

09:53.692 --> 09:54.959
More bad news.
I just checked.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.627
All our jewels are missing
from our safe.

09:56.628 --> 09:57.794
( gasps )
Oh, no.

09:57.795 --> 09:58.996
We have jewels?

09:58.997 --> 10:00.998
Of course.
Oh.

10:00.999 --> 10:02.600
We have a safe?

10:03.101 --> 10:04.802
Let's think.

10:04.803 --> 10:07.137
Since Martha has
no magic of her own,

10:07.138 --> 10:08.939
she probably wanted the jewels

10:08.940 --> 10:11.242
so that she can buy potions
on the magic black market.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.077
So she can have
her own magic back,

10:13.078 --> 10:14.278
continue her evil ways,

10:14.279 --> 10:16.413
and wreak havoc
on an unsuspecting world.

10:16.414 --> 10:17.881
Where is this safe?

10:17.882 --> 10:19.383
I'm in denial here.

10:19.384 --> 10:21.585
We've got to find her.
Let's see.

10:21.586 --> 10:23.287
The book and the rope
came from school.

10:23.288 --> 10:24.655
You better go back there

10:24.656 --> 10:26.657
in case she thinks
of anything else she needs.

10:26.658 --> 10:28.659
And I'll call
the Other Realm police.

10:28.660 --> 10:29.727
Good. And I'll see
if there's

10:29.728 --> 10:31.896
any information on Martha
on the Witch Wide Web.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.498
She had lovely
penmanship.

10:36.134 --> 10:37.702
( both shout )
What are you doing here?

10:37.703 --> 10:39.337
Just getting out
of wrestling practice.

10:39.338 --> 10:40.471
What are you doing here?

10:40.472 --> 10:42.540
I-I forgot
my chemistry book.

10:44.376 --> 10:45.643
Jewels?
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.978
That's where I put
the props from, uh,

10:47.979 --> 10:50.614
the school production
of <i>Rich People</i>

10:50.615 --> 10:52.650
that hasn't been announced yet,
but I'm starring in,

10:52.651 --> 10:55.453
that I haven't told
anyone about yet.

10:55.454 --> 10:56.720
Is that by Thornton Wilder?

10:59.324 --> 11:02.993
So Sabrina Spellman
is a jewel thief

11:02.994 --> 11:06.764
and future
prison laundry employee.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.769
( <i>mischievous theme playing</i> )

11:13.438 --> 11:16.274
Aha.
They're in this together.

11:20.011 --> 11:21.679
You know what?
Uh, you go ahead.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.014
I-I gotta find
something else.

11:37.329 --> 11:38.896
Martha was once in prison

11:38.897 --> 11:41.231
for trying to steal
the Star of Orion.

11:41.232 --> 11:42.967
The rarest gem in the universe?

11:42.968 --> 11:45.069
Once owned by Elizabeth Taylor.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.303
Whoever possesses it

11:46.304 --> 11:48.772
can use it to steal power
from other witches.

11:48.773 --> 11:50.074
Isn't it still on display

11:50.075 --> 11:52.309
at the Other Realm Museum
of Cosmic Debris?

11:52.310 --> 11:54.578
Yes.
Next to a chunk of Skylab.

11:54.579 --> 11:57.314
My guess is,
we go there, we find Martha.

11:57.315 --> 12:01.018
And now for the toxic fugu
inexpertly prepared.

12:03.221 --> 12:05.188
Great. No death.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.030
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

12:22.274 --> 12:23.474
( thunder crashes )

12:26.311 --> 12:27.445
( thunder crashes )

12:31.083 --> 12:33.017
Oh, it's gonna
be really hard

12:33.018 --> 12:35.652
to find you in there,
Spellman.

12:38.022 --> 12:40.724
Spellman?

12:40.725 --> 12:42.126
Is that a black hole?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.461
Oh! Oh, my eyes!

12:46.531 --> 12:48.332
Okay, Martha,
where are you?

12:50.135 --> 12:51.468
Oh, you may be
a dangerous criminal,

12:51.469 --> 12:53.204
but you're not
very good as a hider.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.271
Gotcha!
( both scream )

12:54.272 --> 12:55.606
Whoo!

12:55.607 --> 12:57.008
What are you doing here?

12:57.009 --> 12:58.709
I followed Martha here,
but I guess our screams

12:58.710 --> 13:00.478
have eliminated
the element of surprise.

13:00.479 --> 13:01.545
So we were right.

13:01.546 --> 13:03.681
She is gonna steal
the Star of Orion.

13:03.682 --> 13:04.849
We've come up
with a plan.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.517
Well, actually,
Zelda came up with the plan

13:06.518 --> 13:07.518
while I looked for gum.

13:07.519 --> 13:08.585
Cinnamon?

13:09.755 --> 13:11.488
We'll use a "hand
in the cookie jar" spell.

13:11.489 --> 13:14.458
See, once Martha grabs
the Star of Orion,

13:14.459 --> 13:16.394
a cookie jar will appear
around her hand.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.629
The only problem is,
we have to be next to the stone

13:18.630 --> 13:19.563
in order to enact it.

13:19.564 --> 13:20.698
Oh, what's stopping you?

13:20.699 --> 13:22.833
I mean,
besides the death rays.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.636
We found the control box
that turns the beams off,

13:25.637 --> 13:27.070
but we can't get
into it

13:27.071 --> 13:28.272
because it's magic-proof.

13:28.273 --> 13:30.007
Well, why don't you use
your nuclear necklace

13:30.008 --> 13:31.108
to blow it open?

13:31.109 --> 13:32.242
That's perfect.

13:32.243 --> 13:34.578
Once again,
Mother comes through.

13:34.579 --> 13:36.280
Oh, yeah.
Don't we love her.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.717
Nothing.

13:41.853 --> 13:43.955
Okay...

13:43.956 --> 13:47.091
I was just transported
by a closet...

13:48.226 --> 13:49.860
to another dimension.

13:49.861 --> 13:51.462
I see the problem.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.797
Mother didn't include
a battery with it.

13:53.798 --> 13:56.533
I know we're doomed, but I feel
an incredible sense of justice.

13:56.534 --> 13:58.102
Yeah, well, one of us is
gonna have to crawl

13:58.103 --> 14:00.171
under those deadly beams,
and these are new pants

14:00.172 --> 14:02.406
so you two can
duke it out.

14:02.407 --> 14:04.942
What we need is somebody
who's not afraid to die.

14:04.943 --> 14:06.043
I know.

14:06.711 --> 14:08.745
¶ La ta tee ¶

14:08.746 --> 14:10.013
¶ La ta taa ¶

14:10.014 --> 14:11.015
( gasps )

14:11.016 --> 14:12.449
Do you mind?!

14:12.450 --> 14:15.085
Salem, we need you to run
through these security beams

14:15.086 --> 14:16.520
to see how dangerous
they are.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.255
It's your chance
to cheat death.

14:18.256 --> 14:20.857
Finally!
I won't be thwarted this time.

14:20.858 --> 14:22.159
Stand back.

14:23.628 --> 14:25.362
( whimpering ):
Warm, warm.

14:25.363 --> 14:26.630
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

14:26.631 --> 14:27.698
SABRINA:
Salem, you baby,

14:27.699 --> 14:29.333
the beams didn't even
touch you.

14:29.334 --> 14:30.667
( whimpering ):
You don't understand.

14:30.668 --> 14:32.869
I blister easy.
I need aloe.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.605
Zap me home,
you mean, mean women.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.175
Why don't we use
your necklace, Zelda?

14:38.176 --> 14:41.211
Oh, that's right,
it doesn't work.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.447
Hello?

14:46.017 --> 14:48.486
Okay.
Be cool, Kraft.

14:48.487 --> 14:52.156
You are either lost
in a parallel universe

14:52.157 --> 14:55.593
or you are being digested.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.031
Hilda, I need the coupon

15:01.032 --> 15:02.766
for those ball bearings
Mother gave you.

15:02.767 --> 15:03.968
Just because your present stinks

15:03.969 --> 15:06.270
doesn't mean you can have mine.
The coupon is shiny.

15:06.271 --> 15:08.438
Perhaps we can use it
to reflect one of the lasers

15:08.439 --> 15:10.274
onto the control box
to open it.

15:10.275 --> 15:11.641
Good thinking, MacGyver.

15:19.651 --> 15:20.918
Oops.

15:20.919 --> 15:21.885
Ha-ha.

15:21.886 --> 15:23.320
Not only is my gift
better than yours

15:23.321 --> 15:26.123
but now you owe me
a whole bunch of ball bearings.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.159
Great.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.360
Okay, here goes.

15:30.361 --> 15:33.363
<i>Whoever touches</i>
<i>this stone from a star,</i>

15:33.364 --> 15:36.634
<i>encase their hand</i>
<i>in a cookie jar.</i>

15:36.635 --> 15:38.168
The spell's activated.

15:38.169 --> 15:39.470
( footsteps )
That must be Martha.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.639
Quick, hide.
I'll turn the beams back on.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.746
( <i>ominous theme playing</i> )

15:50.281 --> 15:51.849
Hm.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.551
This potion better be worth

15:53.552 --> 15:55.653
a bag of stolen jewels.

16:04.895 --> 16:06.430
Why didn't we think
of that?

16:06.431 --> 16:07.864
MARTHA:
There it is.

16:07.865 --> 16:11.301
All the power in the universe.

16:11.302 --> 16:13.571
It looked better
in the catalog, but...

16:15.340 --> 16:17.541
( sighs )

16:17.542 --> 16:19.677
Hey!
We've got her.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.345
( footsteps )
Security's coming.

16:21.346 --> 16:23.413
I'm holding the Star of Orion.

16:23.414 --> 16:25.349
That might look suspicious.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.556
Maybe I should've incanted

16:32.557 --> 16:35.125
the unbreakable
plastic cookie-jar spell.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.994
Hello?

16:36.995 --> 16:38.162
As if it couldn't get
any worse.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.064
Ladies and gentlemen,
my vice principal.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.498
Oh, what a mess.

16:41.499 --> 16:43.467
And me without my whisk broom.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.469
Freeze!
Oh, finally. I was--

16:45.470 --> 16:47.304
Hey. Hey!
Hey, don't hurt him!

16:48.907 --> 16:50.140
Don't hurt her!
Hilda?

16:50.141 --> 16:52.409
Oh! Oh, I should have
seen this coming.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.677
Hey, take it easy.

16:53.678 --> 16:55.379
I'm going,
I'm going.

16:55.380 --> 16:56.346
Don't hurt them.

16:56.347 --> 16:58.148
Oh, shucks,
they didn't hear me.

17:03.121 --> 17:04.988
Martha.

17:04.989 --> 17:07.290
So I guess when we agreed
to be pen pals,

17:07.291 --> 17:09.626
I was the only who took
the pal part seriously.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.261
You're right, Sabrina.

17:11.262 --> 17:14.263
You've been so nice
and I've taken advantage.

17:14.265 --> 17:16.165
Here, take this stone.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.867
Save me from myself.

17:17.867 --> 17:19.936
See? You aren't all bad.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.006
I knew I was
a good judge of people.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.541
( laughs )
Now I have your magic.

17:25.542 --> 17:27.042
See ya.

17:27.044 --> 17:29.847
Oh, I'm really glad no one
else was here to see that.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.249
You're in for a world
of hurt, librarian!

17:33.217 --> 17:35.119
( <i>action theme playing</i> )

17:36.487 --> 17:38.155
Give me back my magic.

17:40.258 --> 17:42.692
Well, at least
give me back my necklace.

17:43.928 --> 17:45.863
( whimpering ):
I need more unguent.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.666
It hurts so very, very bad.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.601
( whimpering )

17:50.602 --> 17:53.070
Oh, they're not here.
That's right.

17:53.071 --> 17:56.039
Well, it was
a good rehearsal, though.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.641
I'm not asking you again.

17:57.642 --> 17:59.476
Where's the stone?

17:59.477 --> 18:01.945
It's in my kidney?

18:01.946 --> 18:03.380
( slapping noise )
Oh, ow, ow, oh!

18:03.381 --> 18:05.148
He's innocent.
Sit down!

18:05.149 --> 18:06.583
We'll get to you later,
Poindexter.

18:06.584 --> 18:07.584
( gasps )

18:07.585 --> 18:08.685
Mean.

18:09.287 --> 18:11.255
Is she your accomplice?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.556
We date a little.

18:12.557 --> 18:15.292
Ow! Bursitis.

18:15.293 --> 18:17.661
When he said, "get to you,"
he meant just you, right?

18:17.662 --> 18:18.729
Boris.

18:20.398 --> 18:21.465
( whimpering )

18:21.466 --> 18:23.501
( drill whirring )

18:23.502 --> 18:26.369
That's to fix the wobble
in the table, right?

18:27.339 --> 18:28.605
Back off, witch girl!

18:28.606 --> 18:29.940
What are you doing
still chasing me?

18:29.941 --> 18:31.074
You don't have
any magic.

18:31.075 --> 18:32.642
But I still have my wits

18:32.643 --> 18:34.043
and a penny.

18:34.044 --> 18:35.980
( metal grinding )
Aah!

18:35.981 --> 18:37.948
Whoo-hoo!
Mother of Mercy,

18:37.949 --> 18:41.252
is this the end
of Martha?

18:41.253 --> 18:42.753
Okay, where is
this Martha

18:42.754 --> 18:45.222
who you claim took
the Star of Orion?

18:45.223 --> 18:46.790
I don't know.

18:46.791 --> 18:48.625
I'm thinking.

18:48.626 --> 18:51.761
Hail Mary,
full of grace, I--

18:51.762 --> 18:53.397
ALL ( shouting ):
No!

18:53.398 --> 18:54.965
I gave you back
your magic

18:54.966 --> 18:56.266
and your teensy
little diamond.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.334
What more do you want?

18:57.335 --> 18:59.636
To turn you in
and save my aunts.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.038
And that diamond
was one-twentieth

19:01.039 --> 19:02.539
of a quarter carat,
lady.

19:02.540 --> 19:05.209
( Zelda and Hilda crying )
Oh, no. They're torturing them.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.910
( laughing )

19:08.479 --> 19:10.881
Or not.
( laughing )

19:10.882 --> 19:12.549
Oh, Sabrina,
thank goodness you're here.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.718
They've been tickling us
mercilessly.

19:14.719 --> 19:17.221
( laughing ):
Zelda and Willard did it.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.456
Oh, we're saved.

19:19.457 --> 19:20.624
Never mind.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.225
They're not communists.

19:22.226 --> 19:23.193
This is the woman
you want.

19:23.194 --> 19:24.127
That's Martha,

19:24.128 --> 19:25.428
the notorious jewel thief.

19:25.429 --> 19:26.530
Grab her!

19:28.099 --> 19:29.366
Wait a minute.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.667
She's a jewel thief

19:30.668 --> 19:32.802
and that's the Star
of Orion in her purse.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.706
I'm gonna go with my gut

19:35.707 --> 19:38.042
and say these people
are not guilty.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.543
So who wants
to start with

19:39.544 --> 19:41.211
the "Job well done,
Sabrina"?

19:41.212 --> 19:42.646
Yes, you did a nice job

19:42.647 --> 19:44.782
of smuggling
in a dangerous criminal.

19:44.783 --> 19:47.150
Who then got us
arrested and tortured.

19:47.151 --> 19:48.985
But look on the bright side...

19:48.986 --> 19:50.787
I don't suppose you could
loosen these handcuffs,

19:50.788 --> 19:52.689
seeing as how
I'm already a prisoner

19:52.690 --> 19:54.258
of your charms.

19:54.259 --> 19:56.259
Martha's really
come out of her shell.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.028
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

19:59.897 --> 20:02.031
He bumped his head
and had some wild dream?

20:02.032 --> 20:03.167
No.
We've used that one.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.268
Bad pork.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.268
Did it twice.

20:05.269 --> 20:07.170
( gasps )

20:07.171 --> 20:08.739
Okay, what happened?

20:08.740 --> 20:09.672
Just go with me.

20:09.673 --> 20:10.908
Don't you remember,
Mr. Kraft?

20:10.909 --> 20:13.477
The EPA found methane
in your office,

20:13.478 --> 20:15.312
a-and it's known
to cause hallucinations.

20:15.313 --> 20:16.780
So all you need to do
is burn your clothes

20:16.781 --> 20:18.314
and take some more sulfur.

20:18.315 --> 20:20.384
Never leave the excuse
to a teenager.

20:21.152 --> 20:22.486
Methane?

20:22.487 --> 20:23.987
Sulfur?

20:25.456 --> 20:28.525
Oh, holy day, I'm not crazy.

20:34.132 --> 20:37.434
So Martha convinced me that she
was a dull, nice librarian,

20:37.435 --> 20:38.935
but I still think
she was sincere

20:38.936 --> 20:40.169
when she laughed
at my jokes.

20:40.170 --> 20:42.506
Oh, honey, everybody
misjudges people.

20:42.507 --> 20:45.709
When Salem was busy trying
to take over the world,

20:45.710 --> 20:47.377
your Aunt Hilda
was convinced

20:47.378 --> 20:48.745
he was just
a workaholic.

20:51.882 --> 20:54.151
"Salem, a clerical error
has been made

20:54.152 --> 20:55.318
"on the clerical correction

20:55.319 --> 20:56.820
"of your original
clerical error.

20:56.821 --> 20:59.690
You don't have nine lives left,
you've got one."

20:59.691 --> 21:01.725
One? Just one!

21:01.726 --> 21:03.727
Okay, I want a helmet,
some body armor,

21:03.728 --> 21:06.196
and a quiet corner
where I can avoid all danger.

21:06.197 --> 21:08.598
And would someone move
that spoon?

21:10.234 --> 21:12.135
Well, Mother just called.

21:12.136 --> 21:13.637
Apparently,
the gift certificate was

21:13.638 --> 21:16.106
for gold earrings,
not ball bearings.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.575
I misread
her very bad handwriting.

21:18.576 --> 21:21.077
See? She wasn't
being unfair.

21:21.078 --> 21:22.479
So is everything okay
with you two?

21:22.480 --> 21:23.447
I guess.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.815
Although, my bedroom
is now filled

21:24.816 --> 21:26.483
with 4 tons
of cracked corn,

21:26.484 --> 21:28.618
and I'm not allowed to watch
television for a week.

21:28.619 --> 21:29.753
Cracked corn?

21:29.754 --> 21:32.022
Isn't that one of the signs
of the apocalypse?

21:32.023 --> 21:33.356
Run away!

21:34.305 --> 21:40.802
