>> ASHLEE...

09:07.848 --> 09:09.883
WE WILL FIND
WHERE YOU PUT HER.

09:09.917 --> 09:14.955
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.
THAT CRAZY LADY TOOK HER.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.726
>> DON'T LIE TO ME.
>> I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.328
>> SHE'S BEEN LYING SINCE
THE DAY SHE COULD TALK.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.631
ABOUT HER GRADES,
HER FRIENDS,

09:23.664 --> 09:25.065
WHERE SHE'D GO
WHEN SHE SNUCK OUT.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.934
>> SO SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A HANDFUL.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.301
>> AND HER FATHER'S PET.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.004
BUT I HAVE TRIED
TO SET BOTH OF THEM STRAIGHT.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.305
>> THEN ONCE SIERRA
WENT MISSING,

09:32.339 --> 09:33.807
AND YOU NOTICED
THE SMELL IN THE CAR...

09:33.841 --> 09:37.177
>> I THOUGHT THE WORST!
A-AND NOW, IT'S COME TRUE.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.112
>> I WOULD NEVER
HURT MY DAUGHTER!

09:39.146 --> 09:41.915
I'M A GOOD MOM.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.717
>> GOOD MOM, HUH?
>> YES.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.119
>> YOUR FACESPACE
TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.356
HERE YOU ARE DRUNK
AND PARTYING IT UP IN CABO.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.224
WE OUGHTA CROWN YOU
MOTHER OF THE YEAR, HUH?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.126
>> YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO JUDGE ME.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.663
>> HERE YOU ARE DOWN AT THE
SHORE GRABBING SOME GUY'S CROTCH

09:55.696 --> 09:56.830
WHILE SIERRA STAYS AT HOME,

09:56.864 --> 09:59.733
AND THAT'S YOU
IN A NIGHT CLUB IN A.C.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.034
YOU KNOW WHEN
THAT WAS TAKEN?

10:01.068 --> 10:02.870
RIGHT AFTER
YOU KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER.

10:02.903 --> 10:06.640
>> I DIDN'T KILL HER!
SHE MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME!

10:06.674 --> 10:08.742
>> THEN WHY DIDN'T I FIND
ONE SINGLE PHOTO ONLINE

10:08.776 --> 10:12.345
OF THIS CHILD
THAT YOU LOVE SO MUCH?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.314
>> SINCE WHEN
DOES HAVING A KID

10:14.347 --> 10:16.984
MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO PARTY?

10:17.017 --> 10:20.053
I'M YOUNG.
I'M ALLOWED TO HAVE FUN.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.923
>> SHE JUST WON'T GROW UP.
ALWAYS ARGUING WITH ME.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.826
IF I SAY THE SKY IS BLUE,
SHE SAYS IT'S YELLOW.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.696
NEVER LISTENS TO HER MOTHER,
LIKE WHEN SHE GOT PREGNANT.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.831
>> WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

10:30.864 --> 10:33.000
>> I TOLD HER, "YOU MAKE
THE BASTARD THAT KNOCKED YOU UP

10:33.033 --> 10:34.902
PAY CHILD SUPPORT."

10:34.935 --> 10:37.004
SHE SAYS, "NO. I'LL RAISE
SIERRA ON MY OWN."

10:37.037 --> 10:38.806
>> SO HOW'S THAT WORKIN' OUT?

10:38.839 --> 10:41.742
>> LIKE CRAP! MY HUSBAND
AND I PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

10:41.775 --> 10:42.976
I TOLD ASHLEE LAST WEEK,

10:43.010 --> 10:46.013
YOU GET OFF YOUR LAZY ASS
AND GET A JOB,

10:46.046 --> 10:47.948
OR I AM STOPPIN'
THE GRAVY TRAIN.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.382
>> SO WHAT'D SHE DO?
>> SHE WENT BERSERK.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.185
THREW A TANTRUM.
EVEN SIERRA DOESN'T DO THAT.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.387
AND THEN SHE THREATENED ME.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.089
>> HER THREATS
EVER TURN VIOLENT?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.425
>> NO. LITTLE BITCH KNOWS
I WOULD KICK HER ASS

10:58.458 --> 11:00.427
IF SHE EVER RAISED
A HAND TO ME.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.896
BUT I DID CATCH HER TRYING TO
STEAL 40 BUCKS OUT OF MY WALLET.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.965
>> THAT MUST HAVE
PISSED YOU OFF.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.801
>> I GRABBED IT BACK.
AND THEN SHE GOT LIPPY.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.103
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YA.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.972
I CRACKED HER IN THE MOUTH.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.974
>> I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.310
>> YEAH?
TELL ME THAT AGAIN.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.248
WHILE THE PROOF STARES YOU
IN THE FACE--TELL ME THAT.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.187
>> ALL RIGHT.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.857
I STOLE THAT LADY'S CREDIT CARD.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.925
>> TO BUY THE SHOVEL
TO BURY YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:31.959 --> 11:35.028
>> NO! I BOUGHT THE SHOVEL
AS A PRESENT FOR MY DAD.

11:35.062 --> 11:35.896
>> A PRESENT.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.465
>> SIERRA IS OUT THERE
ALIVE SOMEWHERE,

11:38.498 --> 11:40.333
AND I HAVE TO FIND HER.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.502
>> SIT DOWN.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.873
>> NO. I KNOW MY RIGHTS...

11:45.906 --> 11:51.011
AND YOU CAN'T KEEP ME HERE,
BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.013
>> ASHLEE WALKER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.016
>> ARREST FOR WHAT?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.350
[handcuffs clinking]

11:57.384 --> 11:59.286
>> CREDIT CARD THEFT?
THAT'S PRETTY THIN.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.954
>> WELL, I HAD TO CHARGE HER
WITH SOMETHING.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.155
SHE WAS READY
TO WALK OUT THE DOOR.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.824
>> SHE WILL, AS SOON
AS SHE POSTS BAIL,

12:03.857 --> 12:05.025
WHICH WILL BE MINISCULE.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.226
>> EVEN HER MOTHER
THINKS SHE DID IT.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.360
WE NEED MORE TIME.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.829
>> WELL, THEN GET BACK IN THERE

12:08.862 --> 12:10.030
AND WRING A CONFESSION
OUT OF HER

12:10.063 --> 12:11.965
BEFORE SHE REMEMBERS HER
FAVORITE EPISODE OF JUDGE JUDY

12:11.999 --> 12:13.533
AND LAWYERS UP.
>> TOO LATE FOR THAT.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.003
YOU TWO SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF--

12:16.036 --> 12:18.271
CONSPIRING TO CHARGE
AN INNOCENT MOTHER.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.240
>> SHE'S AS INNOCENT
AS BERNIE MADOFF.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.976
>> WHO CALLED YOU IN, SOPHIE?
>> ASHLEE'S FATHER RALPH.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.444
APPARENTLY,
HE SAW ME ON TELEVISION.

12:24.477 --> 12:27.781
>> THEN DIALED 1-800-WEASEL?

12:27.815 --> 12:29.349
>> I'M GOING TO SEE MY CLIENT.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.851
>> KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE TWO.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.352
I'M GONNA TALK
WITH RALPH WALKER,

12:32.385 --> 12:35.989
TRY AND DIG A LITTLE DEEPER
INTO THE SHOVEL STORY.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.962
>> SO WHERE'S ASHLEE?
>> SHE'S DOWN AT THE PRECINCT.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.465
>> I WANNA GO DOWN THERE
BUT, UM...

12:45.498 --> 12:48.135
FIGURED I'D PROBABLY GET
TOO EMOTIONAL.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
BEST LET MY WIFE HANDLE THAT.

12:50.203 --> 12:54.107
[laughs] THAT'S KINDA HOW
IT WORKS IN THIS FAMILY.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.077
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S THE WAY IT
WORKS IN A LOTTA FAMILIES.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.480
>> IS EVERYTHING GONNA BE OKAY?

13:00.513 --> 13:02.149
>> RIGHT NOW, NO.

13:02.182 --> 13:05.185
ASHLEE'S BEEN CHARGED
WITH CREDIT CARD FRAUD.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.287
>> I'D LIKE TO SAY
I'M SURPRISED,

13:07.320 --> 13:10.423
BUT...SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED
THINGS SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.193
>> LIKE A BABY?

13:16.930 --> 13:20.233
>> SHE'S A GOOD MOTHER,
I GUESS.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.235
LOOK, ALL'S I KNOW...

13:22.269 --> 13:26.239
IS THAT WHEN I GOT SOBER...

13:26.273 --> 13:28.041
I TRIED TO SHOW HER

13:28.075 --> 13:31.011
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE
TO BE A GOOD PARENT.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.312
>> WE ALL DO THE BEST WE CAN

13:32.345 --> 13:35.248
AND WE TRY TO LIVE
WITH THE REST.

13:35.282 --> 13:39.252
>> FOR THE FIRST 18 YEARS
OF HER LIFE, I DID MY WORST.

13:42.222 --> 13:45.325
BUT THAT LITTLE ANGEL...

13:45.358 --> 13:49.930
SHE'S THE REASON I GOT SOBER.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.532
I MEAN, FOR MY WIFE
AND ASHLEE TOO,

13:52.565 --> 13:55.435
BUT, UH...

13:55.468 --> 14:00.073
THE REAL REASON WAS FOR SIERRA.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.109
YOU WILL FIND HER, WON'T YOU?

14:02.142 --> 14:04.277
>> WE'RE GONNA TRY.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.079
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOTTA TAKE CARE

14:06.113 --> 14:08.348
OF ASHLEE'S PROBLEMS
WITH THE FRAUD.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.583
SHE SAID SHE BOUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.052
>> OH.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.221
>> WE HAVE TO RETURN
ALL THE STOLEN ITEMS.

14:14.254 --> 14:18.191
>> SHE GOT THIS
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S DIME.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.294
PRETTY OBVIOUS IT'S BEEN USED.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.199
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE
IS A LITTLE GIRL OUT THERE...

14:26.233 --> 14:27.600
>> YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
>> NO.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.069
>>...SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.138
INSTEAD OF HUNTING DOWN
EVERY LEAD

14:31.171 --> 14:34.174
AND TRYING TO FIND
THIS POOR MISSING CHILD,

14:34.207 --> 14:37.277
THE POLICE ARE WASTING THEIR
TIME PERSECUTING THE VICTIMS,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.246
A FAMILY WORRIED SICK.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.081
>> DETECTIVE,
ARE THESE ALLEGATIONS TRUE?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.183
>> IS THE NYPD HARASSING
THE WALKER FAMILY?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.652
>> NO COMMENT.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.154
>> DETECTIVE, WAS THAT SHOVEL
USED FOR THE CRIME?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.521
IS SIERRA WALKER DEAD?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.457
>> THIS IS AN ONGOING
INVESTIGATION.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.992
WE'RE TRACKING DOWN
EVERY LEAD.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.226
>> ARE YOU WORRIED, MS. DEVERE?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.262
COULD YOU CLIENT HAVE USED THAT
SHOVEL TO BURY HER DAUGHTER?

14:55.295 --> 14:56.696
>> FOLKS, LET'S JUST STAY
ON TOPIC.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.498
I CALLED THIS PRESS CONFERENCE
TO CLEAR THE NAME

14:58.531 --> 15:00.300
OF AN INNOCENT YOUNG MOTHER.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.703
THE ONLY THING THE POLICE
ARE GOING TO FIND ON THAT SHOVEL

15:03.736 --> 15:07.640
IS SOIL FROM RALPH WALKER'S
AWARD-WINNING ROSES.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.343
>> NO DNA FROM SIERRA WALKER.
>> OR HAIR OR TISSUE.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.046
ASHLEE'S PRINTS ARE ON IT,
AS ARE RALPH'S AND YOURS.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.115
AND PLAIN OLD DIRT.
>> SO NOTHING UNUSUAL.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.184
>> HEY, YOU GUYS FIND ANYTHING
ON THE WALKER SHOVEL?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.952
>> THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE DISCUSSING NOW.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.154
>> WELL, PUT AN ASAP ON THAT
SOIL, O'HALLY, YOU'RE ALL GOOD.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.555
>> I DID THAT.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.224
LIKE I SAID, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GOING OVER NOW.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.725
>> WE'RE LIKE ONE BRAIN.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.726
>> THE ONLY THING UNIQUE

15:26.759 --> 15:28.595
IS HIGH LEVELS
OF POLYAROMATIC HYDROCARBONS.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.829
>> SAY AGAIN?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.632
>> POLYAROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
ARE A BYPRODUCT OF PETROLEUM.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.134
LEVELS THIS HIGH,

15:34.167 --> 15:35.735
GAS HAD TO BE LEAKING STRAIGHT
INTO THE GROUND.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.504
>> LIKE FUEL
FROM AN UNDERGROUND TANK.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.039
YOU'RE THINKING
SIERRA WAS BURIED

15:39.072 --> 15:40.207
SOMEWHERE NEAR A GAS STATION?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.142
>> YEAH, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.177
I GO INTO A GAS STATION
TO FILL UP, BUY SOME SMOKES--

15:44.211 --> 15:46.213
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT I SMOKE,
'CAUSE THAT'S NASTY--

15:46.246 --> 15:48.281
BUT LIKE THERE'S A MOM THERE
BURYING HER KID?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.350
I GO, "AAH! HOLY CRAP!"
>> HEY, DALE.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.652
BE A REAL HELP AND BRING
THESE FILES NEXT DOOR.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.456
>> I'M ON IT.
HEY, BING, BANG, BONG.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.227
>> NOW YOU KNOW WHAT
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.728
>> RIGHT. SO A GAS STATION

16:01.761 --> 16:03.663
WITH CARS COMIN' AND GOIN'
AT ALL HOURS.

16:03.696 --> 16:06.533
I MEAN, IT'S TOO RISKY EVEN
FOR A KID AS DUMB AS ASHLEE.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.068
>> MAYBE IT WAS A STATION
OUT OF BUSINESS

16:08.101 --> 16:09.269
OR EVEN TORN DOWN.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.105
EVER SINCE THE '80s, EVERY
GAS STATION'S HAD TO REGISTER

16:12.139 --> 16:14.041
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.176
EACH RED DOT REPRESENTS
A GAS STATION,

16:16.209 --> 16:18.045
OPERATIONAL OR CLOSED.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.747
THE BLUE CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE
IS THE WALKER HOUSE.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.249
IT'S GONNA TAKE WEEKS

16:22.282 --> 16:24.017
TO INVESTIGATE EVERY ONE OF
THOSE THINGS.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.385
>> BUT ASHLEE MAY BE
A SELFISH BRAT,

16:25.418 --> 16:26.386
BUT SHE'S NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.688
SHE WOULDA BEEN SCARED, SO...

16:28.721 --> 16:32.125
SHE'D WANNA BURY SIERRA
SOMEPLACE FAMILIAR

16:32.159 --> 16:34.594
WHERE SHE FELT SAFE.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.732
[knocking]

16:41.234 --> 16:42.202
RALPH?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.370
[background video sounds]

16:43.403 --> 16:46.239
>> IT'S DETECTIVE STABLER.

16:46.273 --> 16:49.309
>> IT'S MY LITTLE ANGEL.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.712
HAPPY AS CAN BE.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.348
>> SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.718
>> YOU KNOW,
SHE NEVER SAW ME DRUNK.

16:58.751 --> 17:03.056
NEVER SAW ME SLUR MY WORDS.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.292
WHEN SHE WAS BORN...

17:05.325 --> 17:09.196
IT WAS LIKE I WAS REBORN.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.531
>> RALPH, THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP HOPE.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.333
>> COME ON.

17:13.366 --> 17:18.438
WE BOTH KNOW SHE'S GONE.
FOREVER.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.608
AND WHY?
YOU TELL ME.

17:21.641 --> 17:25.778
WHY DO THINGS LIKE THAT
HAPPEN?

17:25.812 --> 17:29.182
>> YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

17:29.216 --> 17:30.250
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:30.283 --> 17:33.286
AIN'T NOBODY AROUND
TO KEEP ME ON TRACK ANYMORE.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.522
SHE'S GONE, AND I'M BACK
TO BEING USELESS.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.325
>> YOU'RE NOT--
YOU'RE NOT USELESS.

17:38.358 --> 17:42.162
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER
NEEDS HER GRANDFATHER.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.296
>> HOW?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.265
>> I WANT YOU TO LOOK
AT THIS MAP.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.199
ARE ANY OF THESE AREAS
FAMILIAR,

17:46.233 --> 17:48.568
PLACES THAT ASHLEE
MIGHT HAVE HUNG OUT AT?

17:48.601 --> 17:50.337
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ALLOWED
TO SAY ANYTHING.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.271
MS. DEVERE SAYS
I SHOULDN'T EVEN SPEAK TO--

17:51.304 --> 17:53.306
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT
MS. DEVERE'S JOB IS?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.774
TO WIN COURT CASES!

17:54.807 --> 17:57.777
MY JOB IS TO FIND SIERRA
NO MATTER WHERE SHE MIGHT BE.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.480
NOW, WHICH ONE OF US
DO YOU WANNA HELP?

18:00.513 --> 18:03.850
>> WHAT'S THAT, PRETTY GIRL?
YEAH.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.153
[sound on tape continues]

18:06.186 --> 18:09.456
I ALWAYS TOLD ASHLEE
NEVER DRIVE DRUNK.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.757
NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF NIGHT,

18:10.790 --> 18:14.394
YOU CALL ME, I'LL COME GET YOU.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.630
I PICKED HER UP HERE
A BUNCH OF TIMES.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.766
SHE'D GO THERE AND HANG OUT
WITH HER FRIENDS

18:19.799 --> 18:24.337
AND JUST DRINK AND...
NOBODY'D BOTHER 'EM.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.406
[sobbing]

18:26.439 --> 18:30.177
[map rustling]

18:30.210 --> 18:32.545
>> WHOO!

18:32.579 --> 18:33.880
>> STEP LIGHTLY, BOYS.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.448
WE GOT A DECEASED BURIED
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.318
>> STUCKEY!
LOWER YOUR VOICE.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.819
>> VULTURES ARE LOOKING FOR
ANYTHING THEY CAN GET.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.190
>> YEAH, I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE THE GLORY.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.625
>> WAIT A MINUTE--
YOU TIPPED OFF THE PRESS?

18:45.658 --> 18:48.361
>> WELL, YEAH.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.396
I'M SORRY.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.898
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
YOU GUYS LOOK GOOD.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.434
DON'T WORRY, OKAY?
I'LL FIND SIERRA.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.569
>> WE GOT SOMETHING!

18:56.603 --> 18:58.405
WE GOT SOMETHING!

18:58.438 --> 19:01.408
>> SEE? WHAT'D I JUST TELL YA?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.214
OKAY...
>> STUCKEY, BE CAREFUL.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.749
>> HEY, DO I TELL YOU GUYS
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB?

19:09.782 --> 19:13.420
>> ACTUALLY, YEAH.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.388
IS THAT A...DOLL?
I THINK THAT'S A DOLL.

19:15.422 --> 19:19.226
>> GET OUTTA THE WAY.
[shovel clatters]

19:36.509 --> 19:38.278
>> [sighs]
IT'S HER.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.547
>> OH, WE GOT A BODY HERE!
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.682
>> DID YOU FIND HER?
>> IS IT SIERRA WALKER?

19:42.715 --> 19:45.418
>> WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

19:45.452 --> 19:48.421
>> I'M SORRY.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.399
>> DOCKET ENDING 2500.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.601
THE PEOPLE
VERSUS ASHLEE WALKER.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.904
ONE COUNT CREDIT CARD FRAUD.
ONE COUNT SECOND DEGREE THEFT.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.806
>> HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT
PLEAD?

20:06.839 --> 20:09.276
>> NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.643
>> I'LL HEAR THE PEOPLE
ON BAIL.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.944
UH, MISS CABOT,

20:11.978 --> 20:14.547
ARE WE KEEPING YOU
FROM SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS?

20:14.581 --> 20:16.649
>> I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.
THE PEOPLE REQUEST REMAND.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.518
>> WHAT?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.387
>> THE DEFENDANT HAS ESTABLISHED
A PATTERN OF THEFT

20:20.420 --> 20:22.955
AND OBFUSCATION--WE CONSIDER
HER AN EXTREME FLIGHT RISK.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.591
>> MISS WALKER
HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.359
TO KEEP HER LOCKED UP
OVER THESE TWO CHARGES

20:26.393 --> 20:28.295
IS RIDICULOUS.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.029
>> THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME
EVEN FOR YOU, MS. CABOT.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.565
AND IF YOU DON'T
PUT THAT PHONE DOWN,

20:32.599 --> 20:34.267
I'M GOING TO HOLD YOU
IN CONTEMPT!

20:34.301 --> 20:35.635
>> I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.370
THE PEOPLE ARE ADDING ANOTHER
CHARGE TO THE DOCKET--

20:37.404 --> 20:38.438
MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.439
>> OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.908
YOU CAN'T ALLOW A MURDER
CHARGE WITH NO EVIDENCE,

20:41.941 --> 20:43.743
MUCH LESS THE BODY OF A VICTIM!

20:43.776 --> 20:44.944
>> MS. CABOT,
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

20:44.977 --> 20:46.479
YOU SEEM TO BE OFF YOUR GAME.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.814
>> I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE DISTRACTION, YOUR HONOR.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.449
MY DETECTIVES
HAVE JUST UNEARTHED

20:49.482 --> 20:51.418
THE BODY OF THE VICTIM--
SIERRA LOUISE WALKER.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.420
>> SIERRA IS DEAD?

20:53.453 --> 20:54.621
>> I'LL ALLOW
THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.023
>> NO!
>> HOW DOES THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.591
>> OBVIOUSLY NOT GUILTY.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.493
>> BAIL.
>> ONE MILLION.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.795
>> FINE. GIVING THE DEFENDANT'S
RISK OF FLIGHT,

21:02.829 --> 21:04.564
BAIL IS SET AT $1 MILLION.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.667
FIVE MINUTE RECESS.
[gavel thuds]

21:07.700 --> 21:09.602
>> YOU'RE FULL OF
SURPRISES TODAY.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.539
>> AND YOU'RE FULL
OF THE USUAL.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.007
IT WORKED.
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.

21:15.041 --> 21:19.078
>> I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR
PARADE, BUT WE GOT A PROBLEM.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.348
>> SIERRA WALKER'S DEATH
WASN'T A HOMICIDE.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.750
>> SHE WAS JUST DUG OUT
OF A SHALLOW GRAVE.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.685
SHE DIDN'T FALL IN THERE
PLAYING HOPSCOTCH.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.620
>> WELL, WHOEVER PUT HER
IN THERE DIDN'T KILL HER.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.889
ENCEPHALITIS DID.
>> SWELLING OF THE BRAIN?

21:29.922 --> 21:33.526
>> BROUGHT ON BY MEASLES.
>> ARE YOU SURE IT'S MEASLES?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.027
NO SIGNS OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.829
>> NO BRUISES OR ABRASIONS
EITHER.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.531
HER TEETH
WEREN'T IN GREAT SHAPE,

21:38.565 --> 21:40.567
BUT MOSTLY FROM A DIET
HIGH IN SUGARS.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.968
THAT'S IT.
>> BUT MEASLES...

21:42.001 --> 21:43.636
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN
THIS DAY AND AGE?

21:43.670 --> 21:47.774
>> SHE WASN'T VACCINATED.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.979
>> IF ASHLEE MAKES
A FULL CONFESSION,

21:53.012 --> 21:56.082
WE WILL REDUCE THE MURDER CHARGE
TO NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE.

21:56.115 --> 21:57.684
>> WHAT'S WRONG, ALEX?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.086
DON'T YOU HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE
FOR THE FULL MONTY?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.821
>> WILL I HAVE TO STAY
IN JAIL?

22:01.854 --> 22:04.691
>> NOT IF YOU CONFESS
TO WHAT YOU DID.

22:06.593 --> 22:08.528
>> WHERE'S THE CATCH?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.530
>> ASHLEE DOES 500 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE,

22:10.563 --> 22:11.931
WEEKLY THERAPY,

22:11.964 --> 22:15.535
AND SHE ENROLLS IN AN ALCOHOL
TREATMENT PROGRAM.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.871
>> WE'LL TAKE IT.

22:18.905 --> 22:23.676
>> LAST THURSDAY...

22:23.710 --> 22:27.113
SIERRA HAD A FEVER...

22:27.146 --> 22:29.782
AND THIS TERRIBLE RASH TOO.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.653
SHE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.155
AND I JUST COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.692
IT WAS ALL NIGHT LONG.

22:39.726 --> 22:44.731
SO I SPANKED HER...

22:44.764 --> 22:48.501
AND SHE GOT QUIET.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.870
I JUST WENT BACK TO SLEEP
AND...

22:50.903 --> 22:54.974
THE NEXT MORNING
WHEN I WOKE UP, SHE WAS JUST...

22:58.711 --> 23:02.682
SHE WAS COLD.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.652
>> WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.754
>> SHE WAS DEAD.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.423
I-I JUST...I JUST PANICKED

23:10.457 --> 23:14.594
AND I BURIED HER.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.429
IF MY MOM HADN'T FOUND OUT--

23:16.463 --> 23:18.631
>> YOU WERE ONLY THINKING
OF YOURSELF, ASHLEE.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.633
YOU WERE AFRAID
YOU WOULD BE BLAMED.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.602
>> NO.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.605
I KILLED HER.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.810
OH, MY GOD.

23:30.843 --> 23:35.214
I MUST HAVE HIT HER SO HARD
I KILLED MY BABY.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.149
[sobbing]

23:37.183 --> 23:40.453
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.791
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:44.824 --> 23:48.928
>> SIERRA DIED FROM MEASLES.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.497
>> WHAT?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.631
>> I'LL EXPECT YOUR CLIENT

23:51.664 --> 23:55.034
TO BE AT HER FIRST THERAPY
SESSION TOMORROW MORNING.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.136
>> S-SHE TRICKED ME?

23:57.169 --> 24:02.008
>> FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, ALEX.
SHE COULD HAVE WALKED.

24:02.041 --> 24:06.846
>> YEAH. BUT I'M GIVING HER
THE CHANCE TO GROW UP.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.883
>> I THOUGHT DEVERE
WAS GONNA BLOW A GASKET.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.985
>> THIS CASE ISN'T CLOSED.
>> YES, IT IS.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.754
I JUST GOT A CONFESSION.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.823
>> SHE MEANS WE GOT
A BIGGER PROBLEM--MEASLES.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.125
>> TWO CASES REPORTED
IN THE LAST MONTH--

24:19.158 --> 24:21.694
ONE BEFORE SIERRA DIED
AND ONE RIGHT AFTER.

24:21.728 --> 24:22.695
>> WHICH MEANS SOMEBODY'S
STILL OUT THERE

24:22.729 --> 24:24.497
SPREADING THE VIRUS.

24:24.531 --> 24:25.998
>> WHAT'S NEXT,
THE BLACK PLAGUE?

24:26.032 --> 24:27.900
>> INCUBATION PERIOD
IS 7 TO 21 DAYS,

24:27.934 --> 24:30.269
WHICH MEANS SOMEBODY
COULD BE INFECTED, NOT KNOW IT,

24:30.302 --> 24:32.071
AND STILL BE INFECTING
OTHER PEOPLE...

24:32.104 --> 24:33.940
MOST LIKELY CHILDREN
UNDER 12 MONTHS OLD

24:33.973 --> 24:36.042
WHO ARE TOO YOUNG TO RECEIVE
THE MEASLES VACCINATION.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.610
>> AND IF THEY'RE EXPOSED,

24:37.644 --> 24:38.878
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF
BUT WHEN THEY GET SICK.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.847
SO WE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHO THAT LITTLE GIRL

24:40.880 --> 24:42.782
MIGHT HAVE
COME INTO CONTACT WITH.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.884
>> WELL, AFTER I ROPE-A-DOPED
THAT CONFESSION OUT OF ASHLEE,

24:44.917 --> 24:46.786
THERE IS NO WAY
SHE IS GONNA HELP US OUT.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.221
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER
INFORMATION ON PATIENT ZERO?

24:49.255 --> 24:51.691
>> THE FIRST CASE IS A KID
WHO WAS VISITING FROM VENEZUELA.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.792
SHE'S ALREADY GONE BACK HOME,

24:52.825 --> 24:54.794
BUT WE'VE NOTIFIED
THE CONSULATE.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.863
SECOND CASE, DENNIS FABER
FROM WATERTOWN, NEW YORK.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.264
BUT THERE WAS NO PHONE NUMBER

24:58.297 --> 25:00.567
ON THE EMERGENCY ROOM
MEDICAL REPORT.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.901
>> MAYBE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A PHONE.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.737
WATERTOWN HAS A LARGE
AMISH COMMUNITY.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.008
>> IF YOU'RE HERE ABOUT
THE BUILDING CODES,

25:09.041 --> 25:11.177
I'M NOT CHANGING ANYTHING.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.145
>> ACTUALLY, I'M HERE TO SPEAK
TO DENNIS FABER.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.914
IS HE YOUR SON?

25:18.985 --> 25:21.087
>> DENNIS?

25:21.120 --> 25:24.857
SO MANY PROBLEMS
WITH THIS BOY.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.927
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
WE DIDN'T HAVE RUMSPRINGA.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.161
AND I CAN TELL YOU,

25:29.195 --> 25:31.263
THERE WERE NO POLICEMEN
COMING TO OUR HOMES.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.900
>> THE COMING OF AGE RITE,
RUMSPRINGA?

25:33.933 --> 25:35.668
>> WE LET OUR TEENAGERS
GO OUT INTO THE WORLD

25:35.702 --> 25:38.004
TO DECIDE IF THEY WANT
TO STAY WITH OUR FAITH.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.772
THEY CAROUSE,
SMOKE CIGARETTES,

25:39.806 --> 25:43.042
WEAR YOUR KIND OF CLOTHING,
LISTEN TO THE DEVIL'S MUSIC.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.276
>> WELL, I'M JUST HERE
TO TALK TO HIM

25:44.310 --> 25:46.779
ABOUT A HOSPITAL VISIT HE MADE
IN MANHATTAN TWO WEEKS AGO.

25:46.813 --> 25:48.047
>> TWO WEEKS AGO HERE WAS HERE.

25:48.080 --> 25:53.219
>> WELL, THESE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN
TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE HOSPITAL.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.924
>> DENNIS!

25:57.957 --> 26:00.927
>> YES, FATHER?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.862
>> THIS POLICEMAN SAYS

26:02.895 --> 26:06.098
THAT YOU WERE DOWN IN
NEW YORK CITY TWO WEEKS AGO.

26:06.132 --> 26:09.769
>> NO, I WASN'T.
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

26:14.340 --> 26:16.008
>> I WENT TO SEE A--A GIRL.

26:16.042 --> 26:18.778
>> AFTER YOU WERE RECOMMITTED
TO YOUR NEW LIFE?

26:18.811 --> 26:20.012
>> THERE'S THIS ENGLISH GIRL
MEGAN--I HAD TO SEE HER.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.714
>> YOU HAD TO SEE
ONE OF THOSE HARLOTS?

26:21.748 --> 26:24.350
IS THAT WHY
YOU WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,

26:24.383 --> 26:25.918
FOR A VENEREAL DISEASE?

26:25.952 --> 26:29.656
>> NO, NO, IT WAS JUST A RASH.
>> IT'S THE MEASLES.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.090
>> WE DON'T VACCINATE.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.626
>> THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
WE DON'T DO.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.096
>> HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

26:37.129 --> 26:39.766
>> A MONTH.
BUT WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.267
WE WERE JUST HANGING OUT
AT THE PARK.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.002
>> WHAT PARK?

26:43.035 --> 26:45.938
>> NOW WHAT?
>> JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.040
YOU NOTICE ANY KIDS LATELY
THAT SEEM SICK,

26:48.074 --> 26:50.042
MORE THAN JUST A COLD?

26:50.076 --> 26:51.944
>> A BOY WHO CAME TO BECCA'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY A FEW WEEKS AGO

26:51.978 --> 26:53.312
UPCHUCKED...

26:53.345 --> 26:55.014
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
HE HAD TOO MUCH CAKE.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.851
WAIT. ONE OF THE NO-SHOWS
WAS SUPPOSEDLY SICK.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.753
HIS MOM WAS PROBABLY
LYING, THOUGH.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.854
>> WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

27:01.888 --> 27:04.223
>> BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH MONEY
WE WASTED ON HER KID.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.959
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SPARKY
THE CLOWN CHARGES PER HEAD?

27:06.993 --> 27:09.662
>> NO. I HAVEN'T KEPT UP
WITH SPARKY'S RATES.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.430
>> WELL, IT'S A LOT.
PARTY FAVORS, HATS.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.598
ALL SORTS OF STUFF.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.735
THIS MOM SAID HER SON LUCAS
WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE THERE,

27:15.768 --> 27:16.936
AND THEN THEY FLAKED.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.705
>> YOU EVER SEE HER AGAIN?
>> A WEEK LATER.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.072
AND SHE HAD THIS LAME EXCUSE

27:20.106 --> 27:22.308
ABOUT HER KID COMING DOWN
WITH THE MEASLES.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.976
WHO GETS MEASLES NOWADAYS?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.712
>> YOU KNOW THE MOM'S NAME?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.980
>> MONICA STEWART?

27:28.014 --> 27:29.882
>> WHAT, DID MY NEIGHBORS
CALL YOU?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.383
>> WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

27:31.417 --> 27:33.252
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE UPSET
AT THE CHOICES I'VE MADE

27:33.285 --> 27:34.921
FOR MY FAMILY.

27:34.954 --> 27:35.922
>> LIKE NOT VACCINATING
YOUR SON?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.990
>> I WON'T PUT MY SON AT RISK

27:38.024 --> 27:39.926
BECAUSE BIG PHARMA AND THEIR
LACKEYS IN THE MEDIA

27:39.959 --> 27:41.928
TRY AND JAM VACCINATION
DOWN OUR THROATS.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.263
>> EVEN IF THAT PUTS HIM
AT RISK.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.798
>> WHAT RISK?

27:45.832 --> 27:46.899
HE HAD MEASLES TWO WEEKS AGO,

27:46.933 --> 27:49.235
AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
HE WAS BORN WITH KICKED IN,

27:49.268 --> 27:50.436
AND NOW HE'S FINE.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.004
>> WELL, SIERRA WALKER
ISN'T FINE.

27:52.038 --> 27:55.908
SHE'S DEAD AFTER BEING
INFECTED BY YOUR SON.

27:55.942 --> 27:59.245
>> WHAT? WHAT, THAT LITTLE
GIRL FROM THE NEWS?

27:59.278 --> 28:01.781
NO, HER MOTHER KILLED HER.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.016
>> NO, MEASLES DID, MEASLES
THAT SHE GOT FROM YOUR BOY.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.353
>> NO. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.889
IT'S MY FAMILY.
IT'S MY CHOICE.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.291
GO LECTURE SOMEONE ELSE.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.161
COME ON, SWEETIE.
LET'S GO INSIDE, HUH?

28:15.194 --> 28:18.064
IT'S TOO COLD OUT HERE.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.398
>> THAT LADY IS A LUNATIC.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.500
WHAT SHE'S DOING
IS A DANGER TO SOCIETY.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.803
>> YEAH, BUT NOT ILLEGAL.
>> OH, ARE YOU DEFENDING HER?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.037
>> MAYBE HE'S RIGHT, EL.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.939
I MEAN, SOMETIMES PARENTS KNOW
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR KIDS.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.407
>> RIGHT. AND WE DECIDED
TO VACCINATE OUR KIDS

28:28.440 --> 28:29.876
SO THEY'D BE SAFE.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.310
>> WELL, THAT WAS YOUR CHOICE.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.079
TELLING PARENTS
HOW TO RAISE THEIR KIDS--

28:33.112 --> 28:34.213
THAT'S A QUICK SLIDE DOWN
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE

28:34.246 --> 28:35.948
OF GOVERNMENT TYRANNY.

28:35.982 --> 28:37.850
>> MONICA STEWART'S SON
GOT THE MEASLES,

28:37.884 --> 28:38.951
AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.953
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT SO BLACK AND WHITE.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.054
>> WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.891
SIERRA GOT THE MEASLES
FROM MONICA'S SON AND DIED.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.325
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
MY LITTLE BOY'S AT RISK

28:46.358 --> 28:47.894
BECAUSE OF SOME
NUTCASE MOM?

28:47.927 --> 28:49.962
>> WELL, SHE'S NOT
THE ONLY NUTCASE MOM.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.798
ASHLEE TAKES THAT PRIZE.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.065
>> BUT HER KID WAS TOO YOUNG
TO BE IMMUNIZED.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.001
EVERY CHILD UNDER A YEAR OLD
IS AT RISK.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.003
IT'S JUST STUPID NOT TO
VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.004
>> YOU WANT STUPID?

28:58.037 --> 29:01.007
ASHLEE WALKER IS SUING
THE CITY OF NEW YORK.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.141
APPARENTLY,
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE

29:02.174 --> 29:04.777
BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT HER
DAUGHTER TO A CITY PARK TO PLAY.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.478
>> THE LAX SAFEGUARDS
OF THE NEW YORK PARK SYSTEM

29:06.512 --> 29:09.048
ALLOW PEOPLE WITH DEADLY
AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES

29:09.081 --> 29:11.951
TO MINGLE FREELY
WITH THE ELDERLY AND CHILDREN.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.386
WE ARE SUING
THE CITY OF NEW YORK

29:14.420 --> 29:16.088
FOR $100 MILLION

29:16.122 --> 29:19.091
WHICH PALES IN COMPARISON
TO THE PRICELESS YOUNG LIFE

29:19.125 --> 29:22.428
WHICH WAS TAKEN BY
MONICA STEWART AND THE CITY.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.463
IS YOUR CHILD NEXT?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.432
>> WELL, SHE'S GOT NO CASE.

29:26.465 --> 29:29.068
PEOPLE GET SICK IN PUBLIC
PLACES ALL THE TIME.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.402
>> IT'S AN ELECTION YEAR.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.271
THIS STORY IS FRONT PAGE
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.140
THE PHONES ARE RINGING
OFF THE HOOK DOWN AT CITY HALL

29:34.173 --> 29:35.374
WITH PEOPLE WANTING TO KNOW

29:35.407 --> 29:37.243
IF IT'S SAFE TO BRING
THEIR KIDS TO THE PARK.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.577
>> WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.046
>> OVER A MILLION CHILDREN
IN THIS COUNTRY

29:40.079 --> 29:41.347
WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH
TO BE VACCINATED

29:41.380 --> 29:43.149
HAVE NOT BEEN IMMUNIZED
FOR MEASLES.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.516
WE'RE SITTING ON A TIME BOMB.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.585
THE D.A. WANTS THE PUBLIC
TO FEEL SAFE.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.821
ARREST MONICA STEWART.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.192
>> NOW WHAT?
>> YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.862
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.565
>> ARRESTED FOR WHAT?
>> THE MURDER OF SIERRA WALKER.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.904
>> THIS CASE BOILS DOWN
TO ONE SIMPLE WORD.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.106
CHOICE.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.474
NOT WHETHER A PARENT
HAS THE CHOICE

30:08.507 --> 30:10.242
TO VACCINATE THEIR OWN CHILD,

30:10.276 --> 30:12.111
BUT WHETHER OR NOT
ANOTHER PARENT

30:12.144 --> 30:14.180
CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE
FOR YOUR CHILD.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.182
THIS CASE ISN'T ABOUT HER.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.185
IT'S ABOUT YOU...AND YOU.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.220
AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE
YOU LOVE.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.856
BECAUSE ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PARK

30:23.890 --> 30:25.224
THE DAY THAT MONICA STEWART

30:25.257 --> 30:28.294
DECIDED TO BRING HER
UNIMMUNIZED SICK CHILD TO PLAY,

30:28.327 --> 30:31.230
THEREBY ENDANGERING
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.601
AND BECAUSE OF HER CHOICE,
THIS LITTLE GIRL IS DEAD.

30:35.634 --> 30:36.936
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.371
SIERRA WALKER
WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY

30:39.405 --> 30:42.574
WERE IT NOT FOR
MONICA STEWART'S CHOICE.

30:46.512 --> 30:50.216
>> MISS CABOT
COULDN'T BE MORE RIGHT.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.284
CHOICE.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.487
WE CAN CHOOSE HOW TO PRAY,

30:55.521 --> 30:58.024
WHERE TO LIVE,
WHAT TO EAT...

30:58.057 --> 31:01.127
AND WHETHER OR NOT

31:01.160 --> 31:04.230
TO IMMUNIZE OUR CHILDREN.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.032
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

31:06.065 --> 31:07.900
THE OBLIGATION
YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW

31:07.934 --> 31:12.271
IS TO DEFEND YOUR RIGHT
TO CHOOSE.

31:12.304 --> 31:17.009
DON'T LET HER TAKE IT AWAY.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.281
>> MEASLES IS ONE OF THE MOST
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES

31:22.314 --> 31:24.216
ON THE PLANET.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.185
IT STAYS IN THE ROOM
FOR UP TO AN HOUR

31:26.218 --> 31:28.587
AFTER THE INFECTED PERSON
HAS LEFT.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.190
IT'S TRANSMITTABLE
FROM UP TO 200 YARDS AWAY.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.625
>> I THOUGHT MEASLES
HAD BEEN ERADICATED.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.361
IT WAS.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.663
BUT RIGHT NOW,
ENGLAND HAS A MEASLES EPIDEMIC

31:37.696 --> 31:40.199
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE REFUSING
TO IMMUNIZE THEMSELVES

31:40.232 --> 31:41.934
AND THEIR CHILDREN.

31:41.968 --> 31:44.937
AND THE LAST SERIOUS OUTBREAK
HERE IN THE EARLY '90s

31:44.971 --> 31:49.075
LED TO 123 DEATHS
IN UNVACCINATED CHILDREN.

31:49.108 --> 31:51.510
>> WHY WOULD PEOPLE CHOOSE
NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN

31:51.543 --> 31:53.412
AGAINST SOMETHING
SO DANGEROUS?

31:53.445 --> 31:57.149
>> THE MOST COMMON REASONS
ARE FOR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

31:57.183 --> 32:01.220
OR SUSPICION ABOUT THE SCIENCE
BEHIND IMMUNIZATION.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.422
>> IS THE SCIENCE BEHIND
IMMUNIZATION FAULTY?

32:03.455 --> 32:05.691
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

32:05.724 --> 32:09.061
MEASLES IS TOTALLY PREVENTABLE
WITH THE MMR VACCINE.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.964
NOT BEING IMMUNIZED
IS IRRESPONSIBLE.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.266
>> DESPITE ANY SIDE EFFECTS
FROM THE VACCINE?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.002
>> THERE IS A MINIMAL RISK.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.337
BUT IT'S MORE DANGEROUS
TO DRIVE A CAR

32:18.370 --> 32:20.172
THAN TO TAKE THE MMR VACCINE.

32:20.206 --> 32:23.442
NOT BEING VACCINATED
CAN LEAD TO

32:23.475 --> 32:27.013
INFECTION, SICKNESS, AND DEATH
FOR UNIMMUNIZED CHILDREN

32:27.046 --> 32:28.214
AND FOR BABIES

32:28.247 --> 32:30.282
WHO ARE TOO YOUNG
TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.984
>> DOCTOR, IN YOUR OPINION,

32:32.018 --> 32:33.519
DID MONICA STEWART RISK
THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH

32:33.552 --> 32:36.255
BY NOT HAVING HER CHILD
VACCINATED?

32:36.288 --> 32:39.258
>> IN MY OPINION,
MS. STEWART'S NEGLIGENCE

32:39.291 --> 32:42.094
CAUSED THE DEATH
OF SIERRA WALKER.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.363
>> NOTHING FURTHER.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.667
>> DR. WARNER...

32:48.700 --> 32:52.504
THOSE SIDE EFFECTS TO
THE MMR VACCINE YOU MENTIONED...

32:52.538 --> 32:53.605
WHAT ARE THEY?

32:53.639 --> 32:57.043
>> DEAFNESS, SEIZURES, COMA,
PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.

32:57.076 --> 33:00.212
BUT AGAIN, THESE ARE VERY,
VERY RARE.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.381
>> SO RARE THAT
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

33:02.414 --> 33:04.216
HAS SET UP AN AGENCY
TO COMPENSATE

33:04.250 --> 33:06.185
VICTIMS OF THESE SERIOUS
SIDE EFFECTS.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.386
AM I CORRECT?

33:07.419 --> 33:11.323
>> YES. THE NATIONAL VACCINE
INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.426
>> AND WHAT IS THE MOST SERIOUS
INJURY THAT CAN OCCUR

33:14.460 --> 33:16.362
WITH THE MMR VACCINE?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.264
I THINK YOU LEFT IT
OFF YOUR LIST.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.366
>> DEATH.
BUT THE NUMBER IS MINISCULE.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.234
POSSIBLY ZERO.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.036
>> I BET THAT'S SMALL COMFORT

33:24.070 --> 33:26.105
TO THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN
WHO DIE

33:26.138 --> 33:27.373
AS A RESULT OF THOSE
SIDE EFFECTS.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.307
>> OBJECTION.
>> UH, WITHDRAWN.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.310
DR. WARNER, ARE THERE ANY
LAWS IN NEW YORK

33:31.343 --> 33:34.146
THAT CAN FORCE A PERSON
TO VACCINATE THEMSELVES

33:34.180 --> 33:37.216
OR THEIR CHILDREN AGAINST
MEASLES OR OTHER DISEASES?

33:37.249 --> 33:38.817
>> YES. IN ORDER TO ENTER
SCHOOL,

33:38.850 --> 33:41.320
A CHILD MUST BE IMMUNIZED...

33:41.353 --> 33:44.323
UNLESS IT GOES AGAINST
THE FAMILY'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS

33:44.356 --> 33:46.258
OR WHEN THE CHILD
IS BEING HOME-SCHOOLED,

33:46.292 --> 33:48.427
IN WHICH CASE,
NO ONE WOULD KNOW.

33:48.460 --> 33:51.297
>> MONICA STEWART'S CHILD
IS FOUR YEARS OLD

33:51.330 --> 33:53.432
AND NOT YET IN SCHOOL,

33:53.465 --> 33:57.603
SO SHE ISN'T BREAKING
ANY LAWS.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.505
IN FACT, DOCTOR,
ISN'T IT TRUE

33:59.538 --> 34:02.508
THAT UNLESS A QUARANTINE
IS PLACED IN EFFECT,

34:02.541 --> 34:05.144
NO PERSON CAN BE FORCED
TO UNDERGO

34:05.177 --> 34:10.316
ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT
AGAINST THEIR SPIRITUAL BELIEFS?

34:10.349 --> 34:12.584
>> YES.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.320
>> I READ EVERYTHING
I COULD GET MY HANDS ON--

34:14.353 --> 34:16.522
BOOKS, ARTICLES, JOURNALS,
THE INTERNET.

34:16.555 --> 34:17.823
IN THE END,

34:17.856 --> 34:20.126
I WAS JUST UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.860
>> SO YOU DIDN'T JUST WAKE UP
ONE DAY AND SAY,

34:21.893 --> 34:24.363
"I'M NOT GOING TO VACCINATE
MY SON AGAINST MEASLES."

34:24.396 --> 34:26.332
YOU CONSIDERED EVERY OPTION

34:26.365 --> 34:28.467
BEFORE MAKING
THE MOST EDUCATED DECISION.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.669
>> YES. I LOVE MY CHILD.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.738
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE NOT
TO IMMUNIZE HIM.

34:32.771 --> 34:36.542
AND I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART
GOD WOULDN'T WANT ME TO DO THIS.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.845
>> THANK YOU.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.381
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
HOW YOUR CHOICE

34:42.414 --> 34:44.150
WOULD AFFECT
OTHER CHILDREN.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.584
>> SIERRA WALKER
ISN'T MY CHILD.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.353
I CAN'T MAKE CHOICES
FOR HER.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.520
>> BUT YOU DID.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.356
YOU MADE A CHOICE,
AND NOW SHE'S DEAD.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.125
YOUR ACTIONS ARE DIRECTLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEATH.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.326
IF SHE HADN'T CONTRACTED
MEASLES,

34:54.360 --> 34:55.727
SHE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.896
>> IS THERE A QUESTION HERE,
YOUR HONOR?

34:57.929 --> 35:00.232
>> IS THERE, MISS CABOT?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.401
>> MS. STEWART, WHAT IS
YOUR MEDICAL DEGREE IN?

35:02.434 --> 35:03.735
>> I DON'T HAVE ONE.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.371
>> BUT YOU WERE MAKING
MEDICAL CHOICES

35:05.404 --> 35:06.572
ON BEHALF OF YOUR CHILD.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.340
>> JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE A DEGREE

35:08.374 --> 35:10.576
DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T BE
AN INFORMED PARENT.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.245
>> YOU CHOSE YOUR INFORMED
OPINION

35:13.279 --> 35:15.514
OVER PEOPLE WHO DO, IN FACT,
HAVE A MEDICAL DEGREE

35:15.547 --> 35:17.616
AND UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE
BEHIND VACCINATIONS

35:17.649 --> 35:20.619
AND RECOMMEND THAT ALL KIDS
BE VACCINATED.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.421
>> I KNOW WHAT'S BEST
FOR MY CHILD.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.523
>> IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST

35:24.556 --> 35:25.391
AND THE DOCTORS
ARE OF A DIFFERENT OPINION,

35:25.424 --> 35:26.925
THEN IT STANDS TO REASON

35:26.958 --> 35:29.295
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE YOUR
CHILD'S BEST INTEREST AT HEART.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.463
>> THEIR SCIENCE
IS JUST ANOTHER OPINION.

35:31.497 --> 35:32.864
>> YOUR OPINION
KILLED A LITTLE GIRL.

35:32.898 --> 35:33.899
>> YOUR HONOR!

35:33.932 --> 35:35.834
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO SHOW

35:35.867 --> 35:37.469
THAT IF MISS STEWART
HAD VACCINATED HER CHILD,

35:37.503 --> 35:39.205
SIERRA WALKER
WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.906
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S TRUE.
>> YOU'RE NOT?

35:40.939 --> 35:42.908
>> THAT WOMAN
WAS A HORRIBLE MOTHER.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.444
IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL SOMETHING TRAGIC HAPPENED.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.380
>> YOU'RE THE ONE
ON TRIAL, MS. STEWART.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.382
>> EXACTLY.
AND HOW FAIR IS THAT?

35:50.416 --> 35:51.550
I'M THE GOOD MOTHER.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.819
I MAKE SURE MY CHILD
EATS WELL,

35:53.852 --> 35:55.554
IS TAKEN CARE OF.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.689
SHE BURIED HER DAUGHTER
IN A SHALLOW GRAVE.

35:57.723 --> 36:03.729
>> YES. SHE BURIED THE CHILD
THAT YOU MURDERED.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.697
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK ON THE JURY'S FACES

36:05.731 --> 36:07.899
WHEN SHE STARTED PLAYING
THE BLAME GAME.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.236
I PREDICT THEY COME BACK BEFORE
NOON WITH A GUILTY VERDICT.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.870
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.639
>> YEP.
>> STILL THINK SHE'S INNOCENT?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.574
>> I THINK MONICA HAS A POINT.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.577
ASHLEE WAS A BAD MOTHER
WHO DID EVERYTHING WRONG

36:18.610 --> 36:21.380
WHILE MONICA WAS TRYING
TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.349
>> MONICA EXPOSED INNOCENT
CHILDREN TO A DANGEROUS DISEASE.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.584
>> SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HER KID WAS SICK.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.553
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS
WHEN SHE TOOK HIM TO THE PARK.

36:27.586 --> 36:28.954
>> BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH MEASLES,

36:28.987 --> 36:30.989
THAT YOU'RE INFECTIOUS BEFORE
YOU EVEN GET THE SPOTS.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.558
NOW, IF MONICA
WANTS TO TAKE HER KID

36:32.591 --> 36:34.426
AND LIVE IN A CABIN
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,

36:34.460 --> 36:35.894
FINE.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.463
BUT THE MINUTE
SHE WALKS OUT THAT DOOR,

36:37.496 --> 36:39.598
SHE'S GOTTA PLAY
BY SOCIETY'S RULES.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.734
>> OR SOMEBODY TRULY INNOCENT
ENDS UP PAYING THE PRICE.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.274
>> HAS THE JURY
REACHED A VERDICT?

36:48.307 --> 36:50.008
>> WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.243
>> ON THE SOLE COUNT
OF THE INDICTMENT,

36:51.277 --> 36:54.913
CRIMINAL NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE,
HOW DO YOU FIND THE DEFENDANT?

36:57.616 --> 36:59.551
>> NOT GUILTY.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.687
>> NO! THIS IS CRAZY!

37:01.720 --> 37:02.754
>> COURT OFFICER!

37:02.788 --> 37:04.690
>> THAT BITCH IS GUILTY!

37:04.723 --> 37:06.658
LET GO OF ME!

37:06.692 --> 37:08.694
HOW MANY MORE KIDS
ARE YOU GONNA KILL?

37:08.727 --> 37:10.028
>> SHE'S THE ONLY GUILTY
PERSON IN HERE!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.563
>> MOM!
>> DON'T YOU POINT YOUR FINGER

37:11.597 --> 37:12.731
AT MY DAUGHTER--
LET GO OF ME!

37:12.764 --> 37:13.932
>> MOM, STOP.

37:13.965 --> 37:17.669
>> IT'S HER FAULT
THAT SIERRA IS DEAD.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.406
>> ASHLEE.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.288
>> ASHLEE,
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.558
>> [crying]
LEAVE ME ALONE.

37:39.591 --> 37:44.363
>> ASHLEE, COME ON.
COME OUT.

37:44.396 --> 37:47.599
>> YOU GOTTA KNOW THAT I LOVED
MY LITTLE GIRL.

37:47.633 --> 37:50.902
>> I KNOW.

37:50.936 --> 37:55.073
>> ASHLEE?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:55.106 --> 37:57.008
>> DAD.

37:57.042 --> 38:00.512
>> BABY. BABY.

38:00.546 --> 38:06.685
>> HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO SELFISH?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.554
ALL I CARED ABOUT
WAS HAVING FUN.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.690
>> I KNOW. I WAS THE SAME WAY
WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.326
BUT I'M HERE FOR YOU NOW.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.529
YOU CAN MAKE IT UP TO SIERRA

38:17.563 --> 38:20.566
BY BEING THE BEST WOMAN
THAT YOU CAN BE

38:20.599 --> 38:21.700
FROM HERE ON OUT.

38:21.733 --> 38:22.868
>> NO.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.672
>> LISTEN TO YOUR FATHER.

38:26.705 --> 38:27.973
[door thuds]

38:29.708 --> 38:33.011
>> I'M SO SORRY
FOR HOW THINGS TURNED OUT.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.980
>> PLEASE.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.716
THIS IS NOT OVER.
IT'LL NEVER BE OVER.

38:37.749 --> 38:41.019
>> RUTH, CALM DOWN.
>> DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.655
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE THE BALLS TO FIGHT

38:43.689 --> 38:45.557
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M GONNA
LET THAT BITCH

38:45.591 --> 38:48.727
GET AWAY WITH KILLING
MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.534
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

39:00.939 --> 39:04.610
>> I GOTTA SAY...
THIS ONE HURT.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.878
>> IT WASN'T EVEN YOUR CASE.
IT WAS A PERSONALITY CONTEST.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.980
THE JURY LIKED THE DEFENDANT
MORE THAN THEY LIKED THE VICTIM.

39:09.014 --> 39:09.781
>> TELL ME ABOUT IT.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.617
I TALKED TO THEM
AFTER THE VERDICT.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.885
THEY ALL THOUGHT MONICA SHOULD
HAVE VACCINATED HER CHILD.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.821
THEY DID NOT THINK
SIERRA'S DEATH WAS HER FAULT.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.823
>> THEY PASSED THE BUCK.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.659
>> IT'S A TRAGEDY ALL AROUND.
BOTH MOTHER'S LIVES ARE RUINED.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.461
>> AND THANKS TO RUTH,
SHE SCREWED UP ASHLEE

39:22.494 --> 39:24.596
AND NOW SHE'S FILED
A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST MONICA.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.765
>> SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING
BUT SUPPORT HER DAUGHTER.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.834
>> RUTH'LL GET AROUND
TO BONDING WITH ASHLEE.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.670
[telephone ringing]
OVER A CASE OF BEER.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.840
>> BENSON.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.075
ASHLEE AND RUTH AREN'T WAITING
FOR THEIR NEXT COURT DATE

39:37.108 --> 39:39.010
TO GET JUSTICE.

39:40.812 --> 39:41.980
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:42.013 --> 39:43.749
>> THEY THREW A BRICK
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.050
LADY INSIDE CALLED 911.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.018
>> IS ANYBODY HURT?
>> JUST SHAKEN UP.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.088
>> NOW SHE'S JUST HIDING INSIDE
LIKE THE COWARDLY BITCH SHE IS!

39:50.121 --> 39:51.990
>> I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T BLAME HER ANYMORE.

39:52.023 --> 39:53.659
>> MY MOM SET ME STRAIGHT,
OKAY?

39:53.692 --> 39:54.826
IF THE COURTS
AREN'T GONNA DO WHAT'S RIGHT,

39:54.860 --> 39:55.894
THEN WE'RE GONNA
DO IT OURSELVES.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.697
>> COME ON OUT AND GET YOUR
BEATING, YOU SKANK!

39:58.730 --> 40:01.032
>> THE BOTH OF YOUSE,
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

40:01.066 --> 40:02.668
>> SHE KILLED MY GRANDBABY.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.002
>> AND YOU'RE DESTROYING
YOUR OWN DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.637
>> AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

40:05.671 --> 40:07.873
>> RUTH, LET IT GO BEFORE
YOU DO SOMETHING YOU'LL REGRET.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.776
>> GO ON, RALPH!
TEACH HER A LESSON!

40:10.809 --> 40:13.745
>> RALPH--NO!

40:17.248 --> 40:19.017
[gunshot]

40:19.050 --> 40:22.554
>> GET A BUS!

40:22.588 --> 40:25.123
>> MONICA!

40:27.826 --> 40:31.497
>> ARE YOU SHOT?
>> HE POINTED THE GUN AT ME.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.465
I BEGGED HIM NOT TO SHOOT.

40:33.499 --> 40:37.135
HE SAID,
"NOW YOU'VE KILLED TWO PEOPLE,"

40:37.168 --> 40:42.040
AND HE PUT THE GUN
IN HIS MOUTH AND FIRED.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.877
[Monica sobbing]

41:05.030 --> 41:08.033
