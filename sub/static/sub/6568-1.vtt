00:18.366 --> 00:20.334
<i>North Dakota.</i>

00:20.369 --> 00:23.104
We can do this together.

00:23.138 --> 00:26.475
There is no "I" in freedom.

00:26.509 --> 00:30.047
Freedom is not "medom."

00:30.082 --> 00:33.319
It's "wedom."

00:34.755 --> 00:38.126
I visited a dance studio
in Hartford, Connecticut.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.764
When I was there, I met a brave
firefighter in a wheelchair.

00:42.798 --> 00:46.935
Back then, we didn't know
what HIV positive was.

00:46.969 --> 00:49.871
Which meant he had
to lose his kidney.

00:49.906 --> 00:52.909
He shook my hand and he said,

00:52.943 --> 00:56.112
"You don't remember me,

00:56.146 --> 00:58.414
but I am your grandpa."

01:02.919 --> 01:05.322
<i>The next governor of Ohio,</i>

01:05.355 --> 01:08.059
Roger Furlong.

01:08.093 --> 01:10.628
- I fluffed 'em, now go fuck 'em.
- Shove it.

01:10.662 --> 01:13.298
<i>- All the ladies in the house say "free."
- Free!</i>

01:13.366 --> 01:15.901
<i>- All the men in the house say "dom."
- Dom!</i>

01:15.935 --> 01:18.271
Thank you!
Thank you!

01:18.305 --> 01:19.872
- Wow, this is amazing.
- Right?

01:19.907 --> 01:22.041
- It's like a happy Nuremberg.
- I know.

01:22.076 --> 01:25.145
Where'd the Red Sea go?
That lady just parted it.

01:25.179 --> 01:28.688
Hey, POTUS needs to know about
this 'cause Meyer's on fire.

01:29.697 --> 01:31.722
<i>We just lost the Florida
third, fifth, and sixth.</i>

01:31.738 --> 01:34.559
Great, so much for
the retired mobster vote.

01:34.591 --> 01:38.127
Florida... ought to break it off
at Jacksonville and row it to Cuba.

01:38.162 --> 01:40.430
Sir, the West Coast
exit polls are looking bad.

01:40.464 --> 01:41.831
What about New England?

01:41.866 --> 01:44.587
Worse than the JPAC's
worst projection, sir.

01:44.618 --> 01:47.741
Are you getting ready to dump a
bucket of pig's blood on my head?

01:47.783 --> 01:49.418
Uh, no.
No, sir.

01:50.342 --> 01:52.177
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.771
<i>Dale, I'm so sorry.</i>

01:55.818 --> 01:58.650
What are we gonna do
without you in the Senate?

01:58.685 --> 02:01.420
Oh, they...

02:01.454 --> 02:03.889
Yeah.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.726
Yeah, you lost, Dale.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.261
Oh, my God.

02:08.513 --> 02:12.049
And, actually, I was told
that you'd been told.

02:13.468 --> 02:15.836
Right. Sounds like you're
in a public place there, Dale,

02:15.871 --> 02:18.672
so you got to...
you got to breathe deep.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.108
Hang in there, buddy.

02:20.142 --> 02:21.743
I got to go.

02:21.777 --> 02:23.178
We just lost
the New Hampshire first.

02:23.212 --> 02:25.314
Okay, great.
Everybody hates us.

02:25.348 --> 02:26.958
You know what?
I'm beginning to hate us.

02:26.966 --> 02:28.384
I mean, this is POTUS's fault

02:28.418 --> 02:31.821
because, guys, I killed it at
every campaign visit, right?

02:31.855 --> 02:33.923
Yeah, you did.
My girlfriend said you are a rock star.

02:33.957 --> 02:35.892
There was a lot of love for
you on the campaign trail.

02:35.926 --> 02:37.794
- Yeah, a lot of love.
- No, not for you, Marjorie.

02:37.828 --> 02:40.264
In fact, that's probably why
you lost the New Jersey fifth.

02:40.298 --> 02:42.132
- Good-bye.
- You know what?

02:42.166 --> 02:45.603
This is time for POTUS to start
honoring his ticket promises to me.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.176
<i>- I want my regular one-on-one meetings.
- Hello?</i>

02:48.196 --> 02:51.142
I want more responsibilities in
infrastructure and education reform.

02:51.177 --> 02:53.678
I want an expanded role
in deficit reduction talks.

02:53.713 --> 02:56.548
I want a Cartier fucking dildo.

02:56.583 --> 02:59.151
<i>- Oh.
- Hey, Ame, are you listening?</i>

02:59.185 --> 03:02.788
Uh, yes. My mom just called.
My dad may have had a stroke.

03:03.126 --> 03:06.229
Oh, my God.
Amy, I'm so sorry.

03:06.249 --> 03:07.460
Is he speaking?

03:07.494 --> 03:11.932
Well, he told my mom he felt worse that
time he ate gay Jap raw fish shit.

03:11.966 --> 03:14.134
Oh, Amy, that's a great sign,

03:14.169 --> 03:16.503
because that's
a very complex sentence.

03:16.537 --> 03:18.639
- Mm-hmm.
- Unless he's slurring his words.

03:18.673 --> 03:20.007
Well, it...

03:20.041 --> 03:23.110
So, do you need to go
and be with him?

03:23.145 --> 03:25.613
My mom said he was asking for
me, but my sister's there.

03:25.647 --> 03:27.715
Oh, good.
Seriously, if you walked in,

03:27.749 --> 03:29.984
can you imagine how
stressed out he might be

03:30.018 --> 03:31.618
with like,
"What are you doing here?

03:31.653 --> 03:33.620
Isn't it time that
you'd be with the veep?

03:33.654 --> 03:36.957
It's the freakin' midterms and isn't
she gonna take this opportunity

03:36.991 --> 03:39.739
to expand her role in the White
House?" Or whatever he might say.

03:39.770 --> 03:41.460
But if you need to go,
Amy, you should go.

03:41.495 --> 03:43.783
- No. I'm good. I'm here.
- All right, good.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.501
- So you got what I said before?
- Yes, Cartier dildo.

03:47.107 --> 03:48.868
I was thinking about my dad,
but I am not now.

03:48.903 --> 03:51.471
You know what? Dana's dad had
a knee operation and it was...

03:51.506 --> 03:53.374
Oh, my God, Gary, stop going
on about your girlfriend.

03:53.408 --> 03:55.042
Really?
Am I that bad?

03:55.076 --> 03:57.645
Yeah, this is you, Gary...
"Dana, Dana, Dana, Dana."

03:57.679 --> 03:59.146
Okay. Okay.
Okay, Sue. Thank you.

03:59.181 --> 04:01.916
All right, item number
job share.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.365
We are going
co-POTAL, right?

04:04.404 --> 04:07.521
Apparently POTUS Chief of Staff's
telling everyone to write their will.

04:07.556 --> 04:10.105
The mood over there
is gonna be pretty grim.

04:10.129 --> 04:12.560
- Like Jonestown.
- Oh, you know what I want?

04:12.594 --> 04:14.748
I want that lipstick
that my stylist recommended.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.994
- Ooh, Miami Sunburst.
- Yeah.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.832
So when it hits
2:00 A.M.,

04:18.867 --> 04:21.632
my eyes will say Holocaust,
my mouth will say Carnival.

04:24.373 --> 04:26.107
Does anyone have
anything on Ohio?

04:26.141 --> 04:29.943
Or why this fucking Internet is sketchier
than our economic forecasts?

04:29.978 --> 04:33.146
Oh, that's 'cause your laptop is still
running on Windows 2000 and shit.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.481
Okay, this just in
from J-stat central.

04:35.549 --> 04:38.056
We've got the seventh
and ninth in Utah down.

04:38.072 --> 04:39.873
Team Jonah's gonna have
that stat watch, okay?

04:39.899 --> 04:42.607
You come to me.
Have some nachos and numbers, huh?

04:42.623 --> 04:44.190
Tonight there's gonna
be a plane crash

04:44.225 --> 04:46.359
shunting a train wreck
onto a crowded highway.

04:46.394 --> 04:49.963
Is this gonna hit the Dow?
Maybe I should have bought stock.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.665
Why, you got money problems?

04:51.700 --> 04:54.769
Not money problems,
money challenges.

04:57.272 --> 04:58.250
Is that Furlong?

04:58.329 --> 05:00.334
Minnesota.
Danny Chung just increased his margin.

05:00.376 --> 05:03.411
Want to bet how long it takes
Chung to mention his war record?

05:03.445 --> 05:04.456
No.

05:04.474 --> 05:06.759
100 bucks says he drops it
in the first five seconds.

05:06.794 --> 05:09.918
And I intend to serve you
the way I served

05:09.952 --> 05:12.820
the American people overseas
when they needed me.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.489
Oh, ker-chung,
ker-ching.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.091
Pay up. Yeah.

05:17.125 --> 05:20.360
I need something positive, okay?
Something to boost morale.

05:20.395 --> 05:24.628
We're ahead on voter turnout
in Lake County, Indiana.

05:24.647 --> 05:26.014
What? That's it?

05:26.042 --> 05:28.435
That and the big quake
hasn't yet hit San Francisco.

05:28.469 --> 05:30.070
Okay.

05:30.138 --> 05:32.673
Hello, everyone.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.608
Madam Vice President.

05:34.642 --> 05:36.944
Well, I have some good news.

05:36.978 --> 05:39.012
- It seems...
- Hey, we are ahead on voter turnout

05:39.035 --> 05:40.447
in Lake County, Indiana.

05:40.482 --> 05:41.815
J-dog out.

05:41.850 --> 05:44.649
I'm sorry, Madam Vice
President, you were saying?

05:45.687 --> 05:48.055
I was saying exactly that.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.959
Yeah, that'll take the edge
off this cornhole.

05:50.990 --> 05:52.826
Everyone, please be seated.

05:52.861 --> 05:56.256
Keep up the good work.
Okay? Hey, Ben?

05:57.032 --> 05:58.466
Ben?

06:00.002 --> 06:02.217
Did you borrow Selina's
Miami Sunburst, Sue?

06:02.241 --> 06:04.072
- No.
- Oh, my God.

06:04.106 --> 06:06.314
- Mike, your phone's ringing.
- Could you get it, please?

06:06.338 --> 06:09.043
It's the morning shows.
She's not doing them.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.819
This is Mike McLintock's phone.
He's asked me to put you on hold.

06:11.851 --> 06:13.901
If I do not return,
then you've got your answer.

06:13.930 --> 06:16.050
Am I disturbing
your downtime, Mike?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.785
Give me a break.
I'm on eBay.

06:18.085 --> 06:19.780
Is this it?
Nope, it's a rape alarm.

06:19.819 --> 06:21.122
Like she's ever
gonna need that.

06:21.156 --> 06:23.391
I mean, she's not ugly, but
she's got a lot of security.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.493
Communications
is your job, Mike.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.128
I'm in a financial hole, okay?

06:27.162 --> 06:29.044
I bought something I shouldn't
have and I can't get rid of it.

06:29.067 --> 06:31.799
- What did you buy?
- A boat.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.435
- Is that a euphemism?
- No, it's a boat.

06:34.470 --> 06:37.038
It's a leaky fucking boat
and no one's bidding on it.

06:37.072 --> 06:40.074
Do not yell at me, Mike.
I did not force you to buy a boat.

06:40.109 --> 06:41.709
I have a cracked keel,
I have to dry-dock it.

06:41.744 --> 06:43.378
There's a bilge, which I don't
even know where the fuck...

06:43.412 --> 06:44.913
Hey, stop talking
about boats, please.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.281
Can someone please help me out
for a second? One second.

06:47.316 --> 06:50.284
Okay, hmm, what is the solution
to your problem, Gary?

06:50.319 --> 06:52.253
Oh, use another lipstick.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.523
Wow, that was easy.
What is the solution to my problem?

06:55.557 --> 06:57.191
I sell a kidney?

06:57.225 --> 06:58.705
You know what? You know what?
Coral Blush.

06:58.728 --> 07:00.362
That's gonna look the same.
Coral Blush.

07:00.396 --> 07:01.596
Stay over there.

07:01.631 --> 07:03.498
Ben?

07:03.536 --> 07:05.283
Ben?

07:06.602 --> 07:09.437
- What are you doing in here?
- Getting away from the bad news.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.640
Just trying to realign myself.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.852
- You know what I'd like?
- Uh-uh.

07:15.886 --> 07:18.944
I'd like to be
cryogenically suspended.

07:19.184 --> 07:22.019
Yeah, and then be
woken up in the future?

07:22.045 --> 07:24.813
No, never wake up.
Just stay suspended.

07:26.554 --> 07:28.322
Are you drunk?

07:28.356 --> 07:30.631
No, I'm just depressed.

07:30.873 --> 07:32.894
All right, look.

07:32.928 --> 07:34.262
I got a plan.

07:34.297 --> 07:36.631
I'm gonna take more
of a leadership role on

07:36.665 --> 07:38.266
as vice president
starting tonight

07:38.301 --> 07:41.503
and I need your advice
as how to set that in motion.

07:41.732 --> 07:42.965
Ask Kent.

07:42.983 --> 07:44.604
Kent Davison?

07:44.635 --> 07:46.875
Yeah, he's back.
Senior strategist.

07:46.909 --> 07:48.276
- No.
- Yeah.

07:48.311 --> 07:50.594
Do you know what his
strategy was two years ago?

07:50.633 --> 07:53.181
Do you remember that?
He had me hang with my ex-husband

07:53.215 --> 07:54.779
like we were this normal,
loving family.

07:54.795 --> 07:56.484
He made us go
river rafting together.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.552
Catherine got giardia.

07:58.587 --> 08:03.007
And I had to listen to Andrew bang
that skank on the riverbank all night.

08:03.077 --> 08:06.358
I said to Kent, "Can you make me
feel good about this somehow?"

08:06.381 --> 08:09.630
And you know what he does?
He points to a graph.

08:09.664 --> 08:13.467
- He is cold.
- Yeah, he's got ice in his semen.

08:13.501 --> 08:16.370
Right.
When's he coming back?

08:16.404 --> 08:18.038
- Oh, he's back.
- What?

08:18.073 --> 08:20.241
He's already squirreled away
in an air vent somewhere

08:20.275 --> 08:22.076
with his fucking statistics.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.570
Where?
Where's his office?

08:23.585 --> 08:26.514
You know that portrait with the guy
who looks like a fat Wolverine?

08:26.556 --> 08:28.606
It's just one door
on the left from there.

08:28.622 --> 08:31.252
- But wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

08:31.287 --> 08:33.321
You know what's gonna
happen to me tomorrow?

08:33.360 --> 08:34.655
No.

08:34.690 --> 08:38.474
My good friend POTUS,
my Gamma Chi brother,

08:38.496 --> 08:41.904
is gonna summon me to his office
and he's gonna show me a sword

08:41.927 --> 08:43.488
and he's gonna tell me
to take the sword

08:43.499 --> 08:45.834
and slide it down my throat
until it comes out my ass.

08:45.868 --> 08:50.250
Ben, one day we are
gonna laugh about this.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.543
One final item...

08:55.578 --> 08:57.431
Although the vice president
appreciates your offer

08:57.454 --> 08:59.733
of stale pastries
and pleasant conversation,

08:59.757 --> 09:01.616
she will not be doing
the morning shows tomorrow.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.985
Is she deserting a sinking ship, Mike?

09:04.019 --> 09:05.887
Is that a crack about my boat?
Really funny.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.755
- You guys are hilarious.
- Put your boat on eBay.

09:07.790 --> 09:09.257
- Thank you.
- Can you put a sinking ship on eBay?

09:09.291 --> 09:10.992
- Thank you.
- You can put anything on there.

09:11.026 --> 09:14.162
<i>- Has no track record as a senator.
- I've been around the block, honey.</i>

09:14.532 --> 09:16.452
You haven't seen lipstick
lying around, have you?

09:16.476 --> 09:19.602
Oh, yeah, it's in the office next to
your Klonopin and feminine itch powder.

09:19.636 --> 09:21.704
Thank God.

09:23.273 --> 09:26.008
- Guess who's back.
- Not Furlong yet.

09:26.042 --> 09:27.671
<i>You can trust me
and the people of Ohio.</i>

09:27.687 --> 09:29.811
<i>I think there's gonna be
quite a few surprises tonight.</i>

09:29.846 --> 09:32.181
Isn't that the catchphrase of the
world's creepiest babysitter?

09:32.215 --> 09:34.817
Speaking of creepy,
Kent Davison is back.

09:34.851 --> 09:38.220
Kent Davison?
The Pol Pot of pie charts.

09:38.254 --> 09:41.156
Wow, that guy is ruthless.
A total inspiration.

09:41.190 --> 09:42.624
Hey.

09:42.658 --> 09:44.926
Hey, I know you think
my stat guys are bullshit,

09:44.960 --> 09:47.595
but we got early exits
on Ohio gubernatorial

09:47.630 --> 09:50.665
and they are not good
for you, Mr. Egan.

09:50.699 --> 09:52.902
Shut up.
Dan Egan's office.

09:52.933 --> 09:55.170
Hello, Dan.
I've got Congressman Furlong for you.

09:55.205 --> 09:56.405
Here you go, sir.

09:56.439 --> 09:58.752
Wipe that thing off
before you hand it to me.

10:00.243 --> 10:02.877
- Here you go.
- Hey there, pretty boy.

10:02.911 --> 10:06.457
You know what they call guys
like you in prison? Sweetmeat.

10:06.488 --> 10:10.317
I have no plan to go
to prison, Congressman.

10:10.385 --> 10:11.919
Holy shit, is that him?

10:11.953 --> 10:14.262
Nobody plans on going
to prison, dipshit.

10:14.286 --> 10:15.836
That's just the way
it works out sometimes.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.120
<i>- I can tell you this.</i>
- You are fucked.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.259
If I lose this election tonight

10:18.293 --> 10:20.461
and I'm back on that Congressional
Oversight Committee,

10:20.496 --> 10:23.732
your ass is toast because I don't like
the way your boss runs things over there

10:23.766 --> 10:25.919
and you are a mighty
soft target.

10:25.974 --> 10:28.803
<i>If I have to come after you, Dan,
I can promise you something.</i>

10:28.838 --> 10:31.072
You're gonna have to be
prepared to be gay for the stay

10:31.107 --> 10:33.308
'cause you're going down.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.656
Chin up, buddy.
You'll be fine.

10:35.695 --> 10:38.713
Mouth open.

10:39.715 --> 10:41.649
Fat Wolverine.

10:43.151 --> 10:45.519
Oh, Kent.

10:45.553 --> 10:48.222
- Madam Vice President.
- Look at you, you're all back.

10:48.257 --> 10:52.369
I see they took out
the sink and the toilet.

10:52.393 --> 10:53.928
Made it a little
roomier for you.

10:53.962 --> 10:57.198
I could punch through the wall
and tap POTUS on the shoulder.

10:57.232 --> 10:59.000
And what would you be
tapping him on the shoulder

10:59.034 --> 11:00.682
about specifically,
do you figure?

11:00.721 --> 11:03.296
- Repositioning.
- So glad to hear you say that.

11:03.307 --> 11:05.147
We are on the same page,
my friend,

11:05.168 --> 11:08.237
both in terms of the party and,
of course, in terms of myself.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.550
Am I supposed to ask
a question now?

11:13.566 --> 11:15.316
Oh, sure. If you want.
Fire away.

11:15.350 --> 11:18.085
And what would
that question be?

11:18.120 --> 11:19.887
Well, that question might be

11:19.921 --> 11:22.464
what do you think is
the best reposition to take?

11:23.993 --> 11:26.561
And what would the answer
to that question be?

11:26.596 --> 11:29.393
And the answer to
that question would be

11:29.424 --> 11:31.258
standing right in front of you.

11:35.204 --> 11:37.939
The answer would be
a certain someone,

11:37.974 --> 11:41.576
shall we say, whose skills
were not adequately tapped.

11:42.811 --> 11:44.646
That's some question.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.282
So, we're good.

11:47.316 --> 11:48.850
We're good.

11:48.885 --> 11:51.813
Great. I'm so glad that we
had this chance to connect.

11:51.815 --> 11:53.516
I really am.

12:01.365 --> 12:05.001
I don't think I was actually
very clear before.

12:05.035 --> 12:08.505
- No.
- My uncle used to have this saying.

12:08.539 --> 12:12.109
He used to say to me, "Honey,
if you're not at the table,

12:12.143 --> 12:14.377
you're probably
on the menu."

12:14.412 --> 12:17.781
And, Kent, I will not be eaten.

12:19.016 --> 12:21.150
Why would anyone
want to eat you?

12:21.184 --> 12:24.220
You do know that I am not
running for office right now?

12:24.254 --> 12:25.922
I am, in fact,
the vice president.

12:25.956 --> 12:29.024
I wouldn't dispute your title.
I might question your role.

12:29.059 --> 12:32.091
It would be great if you would stand up
when the vice president enters a room.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.397
- Oh, Lord, all right.
- Oh, Lord.

12:34.431 --> 12:36.265
- There you go.
- Oh, at ease, Kent.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.275
I'm just looking for my mug.

12:38.298 --> 12:40.137
Yeah.
I love this baby.

12:40.171 --> 12:42.305
- It holds about nine cups' worth.
- Oh, wow.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.900
Yeah, it's the only thing I'd save
if this building were on fire.

12:44.926 --> 12:48.311
Okay. This is such a silly
conversation that we're having.

12:48.345 --> 12:49.779
I'm gonna go talk
to the President.

12:49.814 --> 12:52.716
- He went to bed.
- He's in bed?

12:52.750 --> 12:55.018
So that makes you
the livewire, huh?

12:55.052 --> 12:57.254
- This can't get out.
- It won't get out.

12:57.288 --> 12:59.488
Everyone, POTUS
has gone to bed.

12:59.519 --> 13:01.869
So let's make sure we make
his dreams come true tonight

13:01.893 --> 13:03.819
by fighting until
that last bullet.

13:03.842 --> 13:07.086
Why don't you take the first bullet
and put it through your brain?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.954
Yes, sir.

13:10.903 --> 13:14.339
I'm gonna have more of a role
in this administration.

13:14.373 --> 13:17.375
- Well, I just crunched the numbers.
- I know. You're the numbers cruncher.

13:17.409 --> 13:19.510
And right now they taste
pretty bland to me.

13:19.535 --> 13:21.569
Well, salt and pepper 'em.

13:25.651 --> 13:27.085
Marion, listen very closely.

13:27.119 --> 13:29.849
You have as much chance of getting
the vice president on your show

13:29.880 --> 13:32.320
as you have of getting your husband
to leave that cheerleader.

13:32.325 --> 13:35.326
Yes, Marion.
We're all aware of that. Good-bye.

13:35.361 --> 13:37.339
Touch and go?
Is that what they said?

13:37.362 --> 13:40.412
No, it's a classic.
There's a mounting on it for a harpoon gun.

13:40.436 --> 13:42.601
Well, Richard, if you hear
me say no, that means no.

13:42.635 --> 13:43.868
No.

13:43.903 --> 13:46.871
- You good slapping down those hacks?
<i>- I really do enjoy it.</i>

13:46.906 --> 13:49.007
It's kind of like dumping
all my ex-boyfriends at once.

13:49.041 --> 13:50.915
Oh, you got a lot of exes, huh?

13:52.278 --> 13:54.442
Hey, dumpling.
It's Gary.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.080
I'm sorry I missed you.

13:56.114 --> 13:58.382
It's just I can't find
her lipstick

13:58.416 --> 14:01.051
and I thought maybe it fell
out of the Leviathan at home.

14:01.086 --> 14:04.889
Okay, folks,
Kent Davison is back.

14:04.923 --> 14:08.092
what are we gonna do about it?

14:08.127 --> 14:10.524
why am I
telling you this news?

14:10.547 --> 14:13.056
<i>would you
please hang up the phone</i>

14:13.087 --> 14:15.436
because I'm the fucking Vice
President of the United States

14:15.451 --> 14:17.131
- and I have something to say.
- I'm going.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.683
So now we got to figure out
a way to get Kent on board

14:19.717 --> 14:21.651
with this whole
co-POTAL thing.

14:21.719 --> 14:25.488
You can't reason with him. It'd be like
explaining Supertramp to a Komodo dragon.

14:25.523 --> 14:27.657
<i>I don't know
what those words mean.</i>

14:27.693 --> 14:29.936
Mike, are you in the middle
of some sort of aneurysm?

14:29.959 --> 14:32.429
- Let's just wind back a sec, okay?
- Yes.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.798
You think Kent Davison
is a bad thing?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.568
Okay. All right.

14:37.602 --> 14:40.171
I have a very strong feeling

14:40.206 --> 14:43.041
that Kent is gonna get
in between me and POTUS,

14:43.075 --> 14:45.310
like some sort
of thick rubber condom,

14:45.345 --> 14:48.080
- ...and I have got to have...
- Unprotected.

14:48.114 --> 14:50.415
Unprotected access
to the Oval Office.

14:50.483 --> 14:53.452
Well, Amy, you were on the campaign trail
with him.

14:53.486 --> 14:55.688
- How do we pop him?
- Uh, I, um...

14:55.722 --> 14:58.257
- Well, I guess...
- What?

14:59.859 --> 15:01.493
- Hey. Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah?

15:01.527 --> 15:03.161
You have to go
and see your dad.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.196
This is the midterms.

15:05.231 --> 15:08.467
Amy, it's the fucking
midterms. Go.

15:08.501 --> 15:10.869
Thank... thank you.

15:12.038 --> 15:14.906
- It's the fucking midterms.
- Unbelievable.

15:14.922 --> 15:16.975
Okay, everybody, it's official.

15:17.009 --> 15:18.677
- We have lost...
- We have just lost the House.

15:18.711 --> 15:20.579
So put everything on the wagons

15:20.613 --> 15:24.616
and shoot the dogs because we
have just lost the fucking House.

15:24.650 --> 15:26.584
- What he just said.
<i>- Yes!</i>

15:26.619 --> 15:28.353
- What?
- What?

15:28.387 --> 15:30.756
I think this is it.
I think this is our time to strike.

15:30.790 --> 15:33.358
Okay, here's the plan.
I'm gonna go pee pee

15:33.392 --> 15:35.961
and then we're gonna
neutralize Kent.

15:35.982 --> 15:37.419
Very good.

15:37.435 --> 15:38.563
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:38.597 --> 15:40.865
Hey, Mike.
Give me a hug.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.634
Uncle Ben's on his way out.

15:44.937 --> 15:47.839
- What is that, Ralph Lauren?
- For men.

15:47.873 --> 15:50.609
Well, that's a good scent.

15:53.446 --> 15:55.380
- Congressman.
- Hey, Brokeback Egan.

15:55.415 --> 15:58.750
Excuse me. Would you get that fucking
thing out from under my nose?

15:58.785 --> 16:00.085
I could, uh...

16:00.119 --> 16:02.754
I just want to offer
my sincere condolences

16:02.789 --> 16:04.423
on the loss of your
gubernatorial race.

16:04.457 --> 16:06.859
Screw you and the face
you rode in on, Dan.

16:06.893 --> 16:09.795
Oh, and on the loss of your
committee chairmanship, sir.

16:09.829 --> 16:12.207
You know, now that
we lost the House...

16:12.208 --> 16:15.479
We just lost the House and you're crowing?
You're actually pleased about this?

16:15.487 --> 16:18.137
Why? Because... well, we lost the
House, that's bad, obviously,

16:18.172 --> 16:20.284
but now this gets me off
your case and that's okay?

16:20.299 --> 16:22.462
Couldn't have put that
better myself, sir.

16:23.211 --> 16:25.879
Are you eating my pizza?

16:25.913 --> 16:28.214
No, sir, you...
because you said that...

16:28.249 --> 16:29.749
No, I said don't
wave it in my face.

16:29.784 --> 16:31.318
- I didn't say eat it.
- It's still good.

16:31.352 --> 16:33.353
- Eat it! Eat it all right now!
- I'm sorry.

16:34.522 --> 16:36.156
Got here as soon as I could.

16:36.190 --> 16:38.959
Just really glad you could fit your
father into your busy schedule.

16:38.993 --> 16:40.460
She means hi, honey.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.732
Why is this
heart monitor not on?

16:44.771 --> 16:45.853
I'm fine.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.835
They don't know if it was a stroke
or not, hon.

16:49.637 --> 16:52.672
Okay.

16:52.706 --> 16:54.640
You said Dad was dying.

16:54.675 --> 16:56.542
Well, I'm so sorry
to disappoint you, Amy.

16:56.577 --> 16:58.311
All the shouting certainly
isn't helping anything.

16:58.345 --> 16:59.745
Yeah, stop shouting, Sophie.

16:59.779 --> 17:01.647
Oh, my God, Amy.
You work for the vice president.

17:01.681 --> 17:03.081
It's not like it's Google.

17:03.116 --> 17:05.884
- Dan.
- Yeah?

17:05.919 --> 17:08.119
- My pee pee is done.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:08.154 --> 17:10.355
<i>- Let's go crack Kent.
- Okay, J-dog update.</i>

17:10.390 --> 17:12.258
Oh, God.
It's fucking Big Bird.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.193
Let's go through here.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.031
- Whoa.
- Sorry to disturb.

17:18.066 --> 17:19.833
Don't know what you're doing,
but I will leave you to it.

17:19.904 --> 17:21.002
Hey, Madam Vice President.

17:21.037 --> 17:23.369
I see you've found my crib.
This is Team Jonah.

17:23.405 --> 17:26.705
This is my hot stat
three-piece, my data Nirvana.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.742
Madam Vice President, it is
such an honor to meet you.

17:28.776 --> 17:31.578
Oh, thank you so much. I really
appreciate all the work you're doing

17:31.612 --> 17:34.548
on this terribly
depressing evening.

17:34.582 --> 17:36.149
Actually, not terrible for you.

17:36.184 --> 17:39.520
Your campaign visits always lead
to a bump for the candidate.

17:39.554 --> 17:42.256
- What?
- You have been a consistent integer.

17:42.290 --> 17:46.094
I'm not really sure I remember
what an integer is, per se.

17:46.128 --> 17:48.162
You're great news.
You even aced POTUS.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.364
- You're like Neo.
- Wow.

17:50.399 --> 17:52.132
- What's a Neo?
- He's from "The Matrix."

17:52.167 --> 17:53.834
Everything he does is awesome.

17:53.868 --> 17:55.689
The first movie.
The sequels sucked.

17:55.712 --> 17:57.772
Guys, we agreed to let
"The Matrix" debate lie.

17:57.806 --> 18:00.341
Jesus, I can feel my virginity
growing back in here.

18:00.376 --> 18:03.345
So you're saying that all of
these numbers are good for me?

18:03.379 --> 18:05.546
- They're great for you.
- That is outstanding.

18:07.916 --> 18:10.651
Could you collate this
for me very quickly?

18:10.685 --> 18:12.586
Signed, sealed, delivered.

18:14.722 --> 18:17.324
- Okay, meet me in Kent's office.
- Yeah, absolutely.

18:17.358 --> 18:20.861
Oh, Kent Davison?
He's in the Oval Office with POTUS.

18:20.896 --> 18:23.197
- POTUS is awake?
- Yeah, last I heard.

18:23.231 --> 18:25.265
Okay, I will be
in the Oval Office.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.469
I will be expecting that material.
Thank you very much.

18:28.503 --> 18:32.806
So what format do you want this in?
Excel? Pie charts?

18:32.874 --> 18:35.876
Just, like, in English.

18:35.944 --> 18:38.011
Is that a racist joke?

18:38.046 --> 18:39.496
Yeah.

18:39.511 --> 18:40.872
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.450
Amy, Amy, Amy.
Oh, thank God.

18:42.484 --> 18:44.352
- What?
- Listen, Amy.

18:44.386 --> 18:46.387
Something has happened
to the vice president.

18:46.421 --> 18:49.390
I know your dad is dying and
I'm really, really sorry, Amy,

18:49.424 --> 18:52.092
but I think Dana took
Selina's lipstick.

18:52.126 --> 18:53.894
It's the one thing
Selina asked for

18:53.928 --> 18:55.462
<i>and I don't have it
and it's ruining her night.</i>

18:55.496 --> 18:57.731
Fine, keep your bra on.
I'll swing by your place and pick it up.

18:57.765 --> 18:59.666
Thank you. Listen, I've got
two options I can offer her

18:59.700 --> 19:02.402
as a stopgap and then we can... Okay.
Oh, great.

19:02.436 --> 19:04.971
Back soon, Daddy.
Mwah.

19:05.005 --> 19:07.407
Hope your boss at CVS is okay
with you taking time off.

19:07.441 --> 19:09.909
Always with the last word.
That's why you're single. Guys hate that.

19:09.944 --> 19:11.210
You have three kids
by two different guys.

19:11.245 --> 19:13.702
Maybe your last word
should have been no.

19:19.918 --> 19:21.518
Kent.

19:23.290 --> 19:26.057
- Where's the President?
- Asleep.

19:26.092 --> 19:28.558
Well, should you be in here?

19:28.592 --> 19:31.594
People need to think
he's in here leading.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.162
But he's not.

19:33.197 --> 19:35.497
He is, according to
the rumor I put out.

19:35.532 --> 19:37.499
Well, I'm not in here.

19:37.534 --> 19:40.501
But since I am here,

19:40.536 --> 19:44.938
I thought maybe we could agree
that at any joint meetings

19:44.973 --> 19:47.007
that you and I have
with the president,

19:47.041 --> 19:50.185
I will be first in
and I will be last out.

19:50.212 --> 19:53.835
Fine, but as senior strategist,
I'll already be in the room.

19:54.451 --> 19:58.183
Are you suggesting
that a senior strategist

19:58.251 --> 20:00.020
is a higher position
than a vice president?

20:00.043 --> 20:01.983
- It depends on the vice president.
- Yeah?

20:02.023 --> 20:04.921
Well, this one is me
and I'm fucking great.

20:04.956 --> 20:06.667
And you're not
an elected representative.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.859
You're only an elected
representative by default.

20:08.893 --> 20:10.761
The American people
voted for him.

20:10.795 --> 20:13.564
And him chose me, okay?

20:13.598 --> 20:16.472
I'm gonna be in the room first.
I'm gonna be in the room last.

20:16.488 --> 20:18.335
You think this
is a negotiation?

20:18.369 --> 20:20.137
What leverage do you
think that you have?

20:20.172 --> 20:21.639
Oh, I have leverage.

20:21.673 --> 20:24.241
I got a big bag
of leverage coming my way.

20:24.276 --> 20:27.978
So, vice president,
president... bam.

20:28.013 --> 20:29.947
Come on, you are
the Vice President.

20:29.982 --> 20:33.084
By definition, you should be at
half the height of the President.

20:33.118 --> 20:35.052
Mm-hmm.
You want to see where you are?

20:35.086 --> 20:36.687
Hi, Kent. How's it going?

20:36.721 --> 20:39.956
Thank you so much for bringing
us the memo on aggregates.

20:39.991 --> 20:42.692
Now why don't you just go and fuck
yourself in your own asshole?

20:42.727 --> 20:45.829
<i>- What the fuck do you want?</i>
- Ma'am, we have that data you requested.

20:45.863 --> 20:47.197
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come.

20:47.232 --> 20:49.467
- Was there a TV on in here?
- No. Come in.

20:49.534 --> 20:51.636
You might want
to sit down for this.

20:51.670 --> 20:54.386
- It's okay. I'm all right.
- Okay. Hit it.

20:54.409 --> 20:56.974
When it comes to successful
campaign visits, ma'am,

20:57.009 --> 21:01.212
you have a lead
over POTUS of 0.9%.

21:04.683 --> 21:06.517
Yeah, but that's not

21:06.552 --> 21:09.420
even a percent-age.

21:09.454 --> 21:11.688
If we round it up,
we can make it one.

21:11.723 --> 21:12.990
- I couldn't find...
- Just...

21:13.024 --> 21:16.126
Sir, she has strong utility
and key demographics...

21:16.160 --> 21:18.261
working mothers,
Hispanic voters.

21:18.296 --> 21:20.230
- She gives us traction in swing votes.
- Yeah.

21:20.265 --> 21:21.999
- She's a useful tool.
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.567
I'm not gonna be used
as a prop again, my friend.

21:23.602 --> 21:26.103
I will never forget
on election night

21:26.171 --> 21:29.340
how you put my ex-husband
up on that stage

21:29.374 --> 21:31.476
and it was my night, Kent.

21:31.510 --> 21:33.711
It was a healing image
for America.

21:33.746 --> 21:35.780
The way that you used
Catherine to make it look

21:35.814 --> 21:37.482
as if we were all
coming together.

21:37.516 --> 21:40.118
- Calm down.
- Don't you tell me to calm down!

21:40.152 --> 21:42.052
I saw that photo
that you had in your office

21:42.120 --> 21:44.722
with the word "glue"
written across her forehead.

21:44.756 --> 21:46.724
- Better if I said cement?
- Here's some good lipstick.

21:46.758 --> 21:48.626
Fuck that lipstick!

21:52.531 --> 21:54.599
Kent? Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

21:54.634 --> 21:56.501
- What, are you high?
- No, no, she's not.

21:56.536 --> 21:58.136
No, that was my fault.

21:58.170 --> 22:02.207
Um, what's going on?

22:04.611 --> 22:06.879
Just been with the president.

22:06.913 --> 22:09.949
He's asked me to stay on.

22:09.984 --> 22:11.551
My eye hurts.

22:13.534 --> 22:15.201
What's that shit
all over the carpet?

22:15.228 --> 22:17.924
<i>Oh, shit. Ooh.</i>

22:17.958 --> 22:20.626
If you have some white wine vinegar,
that'll get it right out.

22:20.660 --> 22:22.194
What?

22:22.229 --> 22:23.896
White wine vinegar
will lift the stain.

22:23.930 --> 22:26.165
You take your eyebrows

22:26.199 --> 22:28.234
<i>- and you get out.
- Here, ma'am.</i>

22:28.268 --> 22:29.668
I've got some wipes.
I've got a lot of wipes.

22:29.703 --> 22:31.103
Look right here.
It's over here, too.

22:31.138 --> 22:32.805
- Ma'am, no! You're tracking it!
- No, no, no, no!

22:32.839 --> 22:34.073
- What?
- Don't do that.

22:34.107 --> 22:35.341
It's stuck on the bottom
of your shoe.

22:35.375 --> 22:37.343
Wait, do I put this one down?
Is this clean?

22:37.378 --> 22:39.012
- Wait a minute. Just answer that.
- Yes.

22:39.046 --> 22:41.813
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, get it off my shoe.

22:41.848 --> 22:45.116
- Don't wipe it. Just give me the shoe.
- All right, take the shoe.

22:45.151 --> 22:47.519
- You should not be in here. We need to go.
- I know.

22:47.553 --> 22:49.821
We'll do a little hop. Ready?
One, two... there we go.

22:49.855 --> 22:51.489
- You got to clean it up.
- It's gonna be fine.

22:51.524 --> 22:53.004
<i>- It's a lot.
- You can do it, though.</i>

22:53.025 --> 22:56.128
<i>- He's okay, he's okay.
- Okay. Okay.</i>

22:56.162 --> 22:58.163
Oh, God.

22:58.198 --> 23:01.033
God, God.

23:02.285 --> 23:04.717
- Amy.
- Dana, hi. Have you got the lipstick?

23:04.741 --> 23:07.274
Feel like my lips have touched the Veep's.
It's quite a thrill.

23:07.297 --> 23:08.642
That's a little disrespectful.

23:08.676 --> 23:11.878
Oh, hey, Amy, let's not start
off on the wrong foot, okay?

23:11.946 --> 23:13.747
I'm a big part
of Gary's life now.

23:13.781 --> 23:15.815
And you're welcome to him.

23:15.850 --> 23:19.720
Amy, I think we both know
that any woman who's met him

23:19.754 --> 23:22.963
but didn't get to keep him
is gonna see me as the enemy.

23:22.994 --> 23:26.027
I'm sorry, but you
missed your chance.

23:30.802 --> 23:32.936
Oh, my God.
I got the lipstick out.

23:32.970 --> 23:36.740
What? What are you doing?
Nobody is gonna know about that.

23:36.774 --> 23:38.842
Sue, did the President call?

23:38.877 --> 23:40.609
- Ma'am, he did, actually.
- What?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.880
<i>- Madam Vice President.</i>
- Huh?

23:42.915 --> 23:46.036
POTUS has noticed your .9%

23:46.051 --> 23:48.918
and he's giving you an enhanced
role in foreign policy.

23:48.957 --> 23:50.321
What? Really?

23:50.356 --> 23:54.050
So, Kim Jong whatever is
swinging his nuclear dick again.

23:54.073 --> 23:57.228
The Russians have planted their flag
on a Norwegian pile of pelican shit.

23:57.262 --> 23:59.597
Could you just send that to me
in an e-mail or something?

23:59.631 --> 24:01.532
You got a sit-down
with CENTCOM in two hours.

24:01.566 --> 24:02.501
What?

24:02.532 --> 24:04.786
Some US backpackers
tried to smoke a doobie

24:04.821 --> 24:07.205
with the wrong dudes and they have
been kidnapped in Uzbekistan.

24:07.239 --> 24:09.173
Uzbekistan is
between Turkmenistan

24:09.241 --> 24:12.543
and I-could-give-a-fuck-istan.
There's a map on page 376.

24:14.246 --> 24:16.581
Kent.

24:16.649 --> 24:18.416
Oh, I'm so sorry about before.

24:18.450 --> 24:20.417
Although, God,
you made a funny noise.

24:20.452 --> 24:22.486
I wish I could get that
as my ringtone.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.321
How's this
for a funny noise, ma'am?

24:24.356 --> 24:26.624
POTUS wants you
to do the morning shows.

24:26.658 --> 24:29.793
- What?
- You will be the face of our failure.

24:29.828 --> 24:32.496
No, no, Kent. I can't do that.
I'm exhaustipated.

24:32.531 --> 24:35.199
You're booked
for 27 interviews.

24:35.234 --> 24:37.002
Better put on some lipstick.

24:37.036 --> 24:38.265
Wow.

24:38.344 --> 24:40.293
<i>We lost the battle,
but we ain't cattle.</i>

24:40.340 --> 24:42.508
<i>Two years' time, bitches!</i>

24:42.575 --> 24:45.777
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I got coffee, I got ginseng,

24:45.845 --> 24:47.946
I got protein bars.
You want some of those?

24:47.981 --> 24:49.448
- No.
- No?

24:49.482 --> 24:51.450
I need that stuff
that junkies use.

24:51.484 --> 24:55.454
You know, when it takes a cop
15 bullets to put him down.

24:58.294 --> 25:00.646
<i>We have three minutes
to the interviews, ma'am.</i>

25:01.139 --> 25:02.561
Hey, I got this
off your dresser.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.721
- Do you want to wear this pin?
- Yeah.

25:09.302 --> 25:11.570
There's a horse
coming out of my head.

25:11.605 --> 25:13.672
What? What are you
talking about?

25:13.707 --> 25:16.075
There.
There's a horse...

25:16.109 --> 25:18.311
Oh, my God.

25:19.679 --> 25:21.914
I don't know why
I'm catching these things.

25:21.948 --> 25:24.350
- Hey, got your lipstick.
- I don't want the fucking lipstick.

25:24.384 --> 25:26.151
She doesn't want
the fucking lipstick, Amy.

25:26.186 --> 25:29.054
<i>This color is better.</i>

25:29.088 --> 25:30.923
The White House
wants to make sure

25:30.957 --> 25:33.192
that they are kept out
of the Veep's incident,

25:33.226 --> 25:34.860
so we want
the lipstick throwing

25:34.894 --> 25:37.119
to have taken place here
and not at the Oval Office.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.563
It was an accident, okay?

25:38.598 --> 25:41.000
Much like when Bigfoot got your
mom pregnant, resulting in you.

25:41.034 --> 25:43.001
Is there something I need
to be in on here?

25:43.036 --> 25:45.270
I was talking about my boat.

25:45.305 --> 25:48.274
Please, Mike, you're talking
about a fucking boat?

25:48.308 --> 25:49.582
Really?

25:49.636 --> 25:52.678
I'm about to enter
a national ass-kicking contest

25:52.712 --> 25:55.648
with no legs and a massive ass.

25:55.682 --> 25:57.917
- It's not that big, ma'am.
- What?

25:59.419 --> 26:03.288
<i>- I think your ass is perfect.</i>
- Good morning, Oklahoma City.

26:03.322 --> 26:05.390
Thank you so much.

26:07.392 --> 26:09.528
Want to play midterm
cliche bingo?

26:09.562 --> 26:12.383
First phrase she uses.
I already got "wake-up call."

26:12.415 --> 26:14.767
Not at all.
I wouldn't say it's all bad news.

26:14.802 --> 26:17.170
Frank, no, I wouldn't say
it was a shellacking.

26:17.238 --> 26:20.340
It's not a disaster.
I mean, not for m-m...

26:20.375 --> 26:23.143
not for me... mean...
excuse me.

26:24.022 --> 26:25.579
Well, we've been up all night.

26:25.614 --> 26:27.448
The American people have said

26:27.482 --> 26:29.882
this is a wake-up call.

26:32.287 --> 26:34.421
Oh, my God, I look so old.

26:34.489 --> 26:36.590
No.

26:36.624 --> 26:38.434
What is that reaction?

26:38.470 --> 26:39.970
Smile with your eyes
if you can.

26:40.004 --> 26:42.072
- Yep.
- And your nose if you can.

26:42.107 --> 26:44.509
With my nose?
How do you do that?

26:45.744 --> 26:48.846
Remember to thank somebody, okay?
Not God. Don't make it religious.

26:48.881 --> 26:51.483
But thank, like, farmers.
They love that shit.

26:51.517 --> 26:53.752
Plurality?
Is that what you said?

26:53.787 --> 26:55.888
Pulal...
yeah, look at that.

26:55.922 --> 26:58.090
- Plurality.
- Yeah.

26:58.124 --> 27:01.277
- It's not good, you know what I mean?
- It's kind of a fish face.

27:02.061 --> 27:03.495
Yes, yes, indeed.

27:03.529 --> 27:06.765
Well, there's been
a plurality of views.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.501
Well, there isn't
an economic Santa Claus,

27:09.535 --> 27:11.736
and don't I wish
that there were.

27:11.804 --> 27:14.339
Well, we are the United
States of America

27:14.374 --> 27:16.375
because we are united

27:16.409 --> 27:18.777
and we are states

27:18.811 --> 27:21.447
and we are of America.

27:21.481 --> 27:23.883
Oh, it was my pleasure.
Thank you.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.688
<i>Oh, great job, ma'am.</i>

27:28.722 --> 27:31.190
- You're done. You're done.
- Get this out of my ear.

27:31.225 --> 27:33.192
<i>Let's get you
in a comfy chair.</i>
