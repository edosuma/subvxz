WEBVTT

00:56.366 --> 00:59.633
Hyun-jun and Sun-hwa,
who prevented the nuclear attack

00:59.900 --> 01:01.600
after a gun battle
against the terrorist group,

01:01.766 --> 01:03.733
undergo interrogation at the NIS.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.633
Why did you do it?

01:04.700 --> 01:06.366
All I thought about was to take revenge.

01:09.766 --> 01:11.333
To walk into the nightmares once again

01:11.900 --> 01:13.000
is a bit frightening.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.733
Hyun-jun declines Sang-hyun's proposal
to return to the NSS,

01:20.100 --> 01:23.200
and goes on a trip with Seung-hee
to take an overdue rest.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.666
But he hears about San Baek
and Sa-woo's escape

01:26.000 --> 01:28.200
and goes back to the NSS.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.066
Meanwhile,

01:36.200 --> 01:37.333
Chul-young and Sun-hwa find out

01:37.633 --> 01:40.233
about another ongoing conspiracy

01:40.633 --> 01:42.966
and come back to South Korea
to meet with Hyung-jun Jung.

01:43.533 --> 01:47.066
But Hyung-jun is assassinated by Vick.

01:48.933 --> 01:50.366
I'll accompany you to the South.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.700
No!

02:24.766 --> 02:27.533
He's our only lead to track down
San Baek and Sa-woo Jin.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.233
We must chase after him.

02:39.866 --> 02:41.266
EPISODE 19

03:42.233 --> 03:43.300
Ms. Choi.

03:43.700 --> 03:44.533
Yes.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.566
Chief Presidential Secretary Jung...
has been assassinated.

03:57.766 --> 03:58.766
Yes.

03:59.366 --> 04:00.300
Yes, sir.

04:00.366 --> 04:01.433
I'll send them

04:01.866 --> 04:02.933
to the scene right away.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.566
Send the SWAT to the scene
and identify Hyun-jun's location.

04:08.066 --> 04:09.000
Yes, sir.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.100
Yes, sir

04:20.166 --> 04:21.666
Chief Secretary Jung is assassinated.

04:21.733 --> 04:22.800
I know that.

04:23.033 --> 04:23.966
How?

04:24.333 --> 04:25.400
Where are you now?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.933
I'm chasing after the suspect.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.066
It's him who killed
Gi-hoon Yeon and Mi-jeong.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.400
-Do you need backups?
-That's not necessary.

04:31.666 --> 04:33.066
Be in touch with the control tower.

05:54.966 --> 05:56.033
Don't move.

06:30.266 --> 06:31.533
Don't make me kill you in one shot

06:32.833 --> 06:34.333
and stop smiling like that.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.200
You remember her, don't you?

06:48.166 --> 06:49.300
I still don't know

06:50.833 --> 06:52.866
the best way to punish you for your sin

06:54.233 --> 06:55.666
of killing her like that.

06:56.133 --> 06:57.166
But first,

06:58.100 --> 06:59.433
I shall make you

07:00.500 --> 07:01.966
pay for what you've done to Yuki.

07:07.333 --> 07:08.266
Take it.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.900
This is the last chance granted to you.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.833
I told you not to make that dirty smile!

07:58.366 --> 07:59.700
This is for Mi-jeong.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.166
Wake up.

08:32.766 --> 08:34.033
Let's get to the point.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.600
I won't ask you twice.
Answer me right away.

08:41.566 --> 08:42.600
Where is San Baek?

08:51.333 --> 08:53.066
Tell me where San Baek and Sa-woo Jin are!

09:17.100 --> 09:18.566
It's neither the sky nor you

09:21.300 --> 09:23.600
that can punish me.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.733
The only one that can punish me

09:30.266 --> 09:31.533
is myself.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.666
Search anything that might give us a clue.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.866
I'll call in the control tower.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.633
It's me.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.666
No, I haven't found anything yet.

10:09.033 --> 10:09.900
Hyun-jun!

10:40.766 --> 10:41.700
I wasn't

10:42.966 --> 10:44.833
present at the meeting.

10:46.366 --> 10:48.366
So I do not know

10:49.166 --> 10:50.500
what they discussed about.

10:51.466 --> 10:54.233
However, it's the North

10:54.300 --> 10:55.533
who wanted to meet us first.

10:55.966 --> 10:58.866
I found them suspicious in many ways.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.566
I will contact the North
for a thorough investigation

11:02.133 --> 11:04.466
into this incident.

11:30.433 --> 11:31.833
When I first came here,

11:32.866 --> 11:34.866
I said we should make changes
as much as possible,

11:35.166 --> 11:37.100
stamp out corruption,

11:37.300 --> 11:39.566
and cut off all the unnecessary practices.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.233
Do you remember?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.066
And what changes

11:46.666 --> 11:48.100
did you make after all?

11:48.633 --> 11:50.133
While Director Baek was getting away

11:50.200 --> 11:52.100
and Chief Presidential Secretary
being assassinated,

11:52.166 --> 11:53.766
what exactly have you changed?

11:55.766 --> 11:57.733
-Secretary Oh.
-Yes, sir.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.166
Do the rules for agents say

11:59.233 --> 12:02.066
you may lend your security card to anyone?

12:06.766 --> 12:08.900
It's your rotten mindset

12:09.433 --> 12:12.266
that let San Baek escape
and killed our agents.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.500
Wait a minute.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.566
Did you just say I let San Baek escape

12:15.933 --> 12:17.500
and killed the protocol agents?

12:17.566 --> 12:19.400
Isn't it too irrational?

12:19.466 --> 12:21.233
Now deceased Mi-jeong used your card

12:21.300 --> 12:22.666
to access the server room,

12:22.733 --> 12:25.066
allowing the transport schedule to end up
in the enemy's hands!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.066
I'll let it slide this time
as the situation is pressing,

12:28.566 --> 12:30.533
but remember that the first rotten part

12:30.633 --> 12:32.066
to cut out is you.

12:35.633 --> 12:36.866
Ms. Choi.

12:37.233 --> 12:38.066
Yes, sir.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.200
You were out of contact
in an emergency situation?

12:40.700 --> 12:42.133
How can an agent be that irresponsible?

12:43.066 --> 12:44.300
Where have you been?

12:45.866 --> 12:47.133
Why can't you answer me?

12:47.966 --> 12:49.033
It's something personal.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.766
If you need your privacy that badly,

12:52.133 --> 12:53.433
you might as well find another job.

12:55.966 --> 12:57.133
And Secretary Park.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.233
Yes, sir.

12:58.366 --> 13:00.566
Why didn't you send backups
when we were after

13:00.800 --> 13:02.666
the murderer of Chief Secretary Jung?

13:03.333 --> 13:04.766
I thought the enemies would notice us

13:06.033 --> 13:08.500
if we take a haste approach,

13:10.266 --> 13:11.900
so I decided to trust Agent Hyun-jun Kim

13:12.333 --> 13:13.400
and waited for him.

13:13.466 --> 13:15.433
Did you say you trust Hyun-jun?

13:17.000 --> 13:17.966
I did.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.466
I don't understand

13:23.166 --> 13:25.300
why you put so much trust in Hyun-jun
whom I don't trust.

13:27.466 --> 13:28.966
I want everyone to mark my words.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.066
If you keep neglecting your duties
like now,

13:32.833 --> 13:34.266
I will eliminate you without mercy.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.900
I'll eliminate everyone if necessary.

13:35.966 --> 13:37.566
It doesn't matter even if no one's left.

13:38.366 --> 13:40.700
A useless agency
that only wastes people's tax money

13:42.366 --> 13:43.666
better be dismantled.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.166
Yes. We're working on it,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.633
but we haven't got any results yet.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.466
Okay. I'll have it ready.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.700
At Pyeongyang,

14:08.766 --> 14:10.566
they want to push ahead as planned.

14:11.100 --> 14:11.933
In three days,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.800
Director of Chosun Workers' Party

14:13.866 --> 14:16.200
will visit Seoul on behalf
of the Chairman.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.566
Once the details
regarding the summit are confirmed,

14:19.633 --> 14:21.266
he will make an official announcement

14:21.633 --> 14:23.033
with the President of the South.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.500
San Bake's escape
and Chief Secretary Jung's assassination

14:25.666 --> 14:28.600
clear shows that Iris
is still up to something.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.433
It's too dangerous

14:31.033 --> 14:33.133
to proceed with the summit
under the current situation.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.333
After the latest coup attempt,

14:36.633 --> 14:39.133
Chairman's determination has become
even more resolute.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.500
We can't push ahead with the summit

14:47.200 --> 14:49.400
when we can't assure its security.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.466
I'd like to ask you to put off the summit

14:53.100 --> 14:54.600
until the issue in the South is settled.

14:54.966 --> 14:56.866
Is that the Chairman's stance?

14:57.000 --> 14:57.933
No.

14:58.466 --> 15:02.233
It's my idea as the one who's responsible
for the safety of the Chairman.

15:02.866 --> 15:05.633
I fully understand your concerns.

15:06.366 --> 15:08.266
However, I cannot postpone the summit.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.433
If we end up giving in to the scheme
of the rebellious power

15:13.200 --> 15:16.400
when both leaders of the two sides
are firmly determined,

15:16.966 --> 15:18.233
they'll keep trying

15:19.233 --> 15:21.900
to use the state of affairs
on the Korean Peninsula.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.666
I'll have it taken care of
before the summit.

15:25.666 --> 15:27.100
So don't falter

15:28.300 --> 15:29.833
and maintain your support till the end.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.333
Listen up, everyone.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.666
Killing people

16:07.266 --> 16:08.900
isn't our goal.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.033
Establish a new operational plan,
and report to me.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.000
Does it mean

16:37.933 --> 16:40.066
you have no faith in me

16:40.666 --> 16:42.133
who put Sa-woo in charge of everything?

16:42.733 --> 16:43.766
We're saying...

16:45.033 --> 16:46.900
it's too risky.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.533
Sa-woo's instructions are my orders.

16:50.966 --> 16:51.833
You just need

16:52.566 --> 16:54.133
to do what you're paid for.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.966
Honestly speaking,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.566
I'm very confused now.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Why?

17:20.166 --> 17:21.566
I have many questions,

17:23.833 --> 17:26.633
but nothing seems clear to me.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.600
Go on.

17:29.366 --> 17:31.533
I have no idea where I stand
within the organization.

17:32.233 --> 17:33.333
It's also frustrating

17:33.966 --> 17:36.833
that I should learn about the organization

17:37.866 --> 17:41.133
only through you.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.566
Did you want to see me?

17:49.400 --> 17:50.566
Is the plan ready?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.733
It's almost done.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.266
Let's take a walk.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.833
Keep in mind

18:05.766 --> 18:08.400
that you're different from the disposables
who are in only for the money.

18:09.633 --> 18:12.233
You may feel frustrated and anxious,

18:12.766 --> 18:14.066
but there's no need to hurry.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.566
It's always the men in power

18:17.200 --> 18:19.266
who change the world.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.266
You'll soon find out

18:22.900 --> 18:24.566
how important it is to have that power.

18:28.700 --> 18:29.766
Sa-woo Jin.

18:34.533 --> 18:35.466
Yes, sir.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.600
Above all,

18:38.533 --> 18:40.133
let me tell you one last thing.

18:43.200 --> 18:47.100
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.400
I guarantee you that it's worth to stake

18:53.566 --> 18:54.866
your entire life.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.066
I'm sure

19:01.066 --> 19:02.900
you can rise to a higher position.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.133
than I have.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.233
Yes.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.800
An elliptic analysis comparing
the candidates and the possible routes,

19:22.200 --> 19:23.500
you'll be able to narrow down

19:23.566 --> 19:24.866
potential hideouts and routes.

19:24.933 --> 19:25.900
Okay.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.700
Is the scene analysis result ready?

19:31.133 --> 19:31.966
No.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.800
I'll check with Forensic Science Division.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.200
Sir,

19:41.633 --> 19:43.300
How is the analysis going?

19:45.266 --> 19:47.766
Okay.
Please send it over as soon as possible.

19:49.066 --> 19:49.900
Okay.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.266
When we were investigating
the accomplices in the coup,

19:54.833 --> 19:56.800
we found an Iris-related file.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.600
I analyzed the file,

20:01.033 --> 20:04.566
and found Seung-hee Choi's name.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.800
I think Iris is planning

20:08.866 --> 20:11.000
to eliminate Seung-hee.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.266
Seung-hee is in danger.

20:18.666 --> 20:19.700
What happened?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.200
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm asking what happened.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.466
I cannot tell you right now.

20:28.566 --> 20:29.833
Nothing happened,

20:30.433 --> 20:31.600
and I came back alive.

20:32.266 --> 20:33.166
Please

20:33.800 --> 20:35.266
leave it at that for now.

20:40.466 --> 20:41.500
What did Secretary Oh said?

20:41.700 --> 20:42.933
He said he'll get back to me soon.

20:44.366 --> 20:46.233
Did you compare these two groups?

20:46.766 --> 20:48.033
There's nothing new.

20:52.133 --> 20:53.066
Yes.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.233
Okay.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.166
Both Pyeongyang and Seoul

21:01.700 --> 21:04.533
still insist on having the summit.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.000
Now we have no choice,

21:08.933 --> 21:11.600
but to settle the situation
before the summit.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.200
Any progress on locating San Baek?

21:18.300 --> 21:19.233
No.

21:20.666 --> 21:21.733
What about you?

21:23.100 --> 21:24.466
What you know is everything we have.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.400
The deeper I dig

21:33.066 --> 21:34.200
into Iris,

21:36.766 --> 21:38.666
the more I feel like I'm dealing
with a huge puzzle

21:38.733 --> 21:40.533
that's composed of so many pieces.

21:41.566 --> 21:42.700
Gi-hoon Yeon,

21:43.333 --> 21:44.500
Tae-joon Rhee,

21:46.333 --> 21:47.366
and San Baek.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.466
They're just one of many pieces.

21:51.966 --> 21:53.100
None of them is aware

21:54.466 --> 21:57.133
of what kind of puzzle they're part of.

21:59.766 --> 22:00.966
The only thing we're certain now

22:02.833 --> 22:04.766
is that it's not
a mere military-industrial complex.

22:07.433 --> 22:08.500
In some places

22:10.966 --> 22:12.733
they exist in a form of ordinary company,

22:12.933 --> 22:14.066
and in other places,

22:14.500 --> 22:17.333
they penetrate the political arena
and even the intelligence agencies.

22:17.766 --> 22:18.866
If they put their minds to it,

22:20.233 --> 22:23.100
they can not only launch a war,
but also replace a government.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.666
Their current goal is to stop

22:28.466 --> 22:30.300
the unification of the Korean Peninsula.

22:38.933 --> 22:39.866
I have faith in

22:41.633 --> 22:44.233
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.466
I have always believed

22:50.933 --> 22:52.266
that it will turn into a country

22:53.700 --> 22:55.333
where the people hold sovereign power
someday

22:56.033 --> 22:58.666
through their own efforts
just like the name.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.566
If anyone disgraces its name,

23:02.233 --> 23:03.766
I'll never tolerate it

23:05.100 --> 23:06.766
no matter who it is.

23:12.033 --> 23:13.066
Does it sound funny to you?

23:14.966 --> 23:16.100
No.

23:18.633 --> 23:21.533
I just thought how in the world
a person like me with no such faith

23:22.766 --> 23:24.133
ended up here.

23:26.700 --> 23:27.966
I just thought it'd be fine

23:28.066 --> 23:30.766
if I could just do what I enjoy
and live my life.

23:32.733 --> 23:33.700
But one day,

23:36.900 --> 23:39.166
I found myself in some fate
I have no control over.

23:48.233 --> 23:49.233
Hyun-jun!

23:51.600 --> 23:53.166
The wine in the photo on Mi-jeong's blog.

23:53.333 --> 23:54.166
Yes.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.366
We found the same wine

23:55.466 --> 23:57.033
from the dead killer's place.

23:57.866 --> 23:59.166
I compared its lot number

23:59.300 --> 24:00.733
with the supplier's customer database

24:01.100 --> 24:02.066
and found out

24:02.466 --> 24:04.233
that the buyer was a golf club
in Gyeonggi.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.766
A golf club?

24:06.100 --> 24:08.366
There's a large wine cellar

24:09.000 --> 24:10.566
for VIPs in the clubhouse.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.500
And the owner of the club is

24:13.633 --> 24:15.966
McGlass, a multinational corporation.

24:16.133 --> 24:19.133
It's a military-industrial complex company
that deals with the defense industry

24:19.300 --> 24:20.933
and owns a private military company.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.700
How can I help you?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.700
Is the clubhouse not operating?

24:34.066 --> 24:35.533
It's temporarily closed

24:35.600 --> 24:37.033
as it's under construction.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.100
These are the footprints from the scene.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.866
Although they're of different sizes,
they're the same shoes.

24:43.533 --> 24:44.766
They're specially designed boots

24:45.133 --> 24:46.766
by Temitron in the U.S. for their armies.

24:47.133 --> 24:49.433
They're mainly used
by special forces operating overseas

24:49.500 --> 24:51.400
or by private military companies.

24:54.033 --> 24:54.866
I see.

26:18.766 --> 26:20.300
Have the SWAT ready to leave.

26:20.633 --> 26:21.666
What's going on?

26:21.800 --> 26:23.900
Hyun-jun might have found San Baek.

26:30.566 --> 26:31.566
Sir.

26:34.633 --> 26:35.600
Please let me go with them.

26:35.666 --> 26:37.533
No. Stay here.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.500
Why?

26:38.566 --> 26:40.300
You're a target of Iris.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.600
Don't leave the NSS for a while
and work inside.

26:42.666 --> 26:44.066
I'm a target of Iris?

26:44.700 --> 26:45.833
What do you mean by that?

26:47.433 --> 26:49.700
When the North was investigating
into Iris-related people,

26:50.200 --> 26:51.466
they found a file

26:52.533 --> 26:54.466
that had your name in it.

26:54.933 --> 26:57.233
Hyun-jun is convinced that you've become

26:57.633 --> 26:58.666
a target of Iris.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.533
So from now on,

27:00.900 --> 27:02.133
don't be out in the field

27:02.533 --> 27:03.666
and work inside only.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.266
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY DANGER

29:37.400 --> 29:38.400
I'm fine.

29:39.133 --> 29:40.866
Go join the team now.

30:51.233 --> 30:52.366
We have a man down.

31:13.133 --> 31:14.633
Team Alpha, search around the golf course.

31:14.700 --> 31:15.733
Team Bravo, follow me.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.800
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

31:33.766 --> 31:34.800
Put your gun down.

31:58.766 --> 31:59.700
My instincts

32:00.833 --> 32:02.633
were never wrong.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.033
When I heard the gunshots,

32:07.500 --> 32:10.033
I had a feeling that it might be you.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.400
Where is Sa-Woo?

32:13.166 --> 32:14.066
Sa-woo?

32:18.533 --> 32:20.200
I sent him on a vacation.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.500
He's probably

32:23.966 --> 32:25.500
somewhere right now,

32:27.233 --> 32:30.500
trying to figure out how to turn
the world upside down.

32:34.466 --> 32:35.566
Stop the bullshit.

32:36.633 --> 32:38.233
I can aim your heart next.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.066
Before the SWAT gets here,

32:43.200 --> 32:44.833
there's something we must straighten out.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.200
Even if my life

32:49.433 --> 32:51.066
went as you designed it,

32:52.400 --> 32:53.700
you must've asked for my forgiveness

32:55.066 --> 32:56.466
for murdering my parents

32:58.400 --> 33:00.366
and abandoning me.

33:00.666 --> 33:01.633
Forgiveness?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.633
Forgiveness is for reconciliation.

33:09.966 --> 33:12.466
What difference does it make
if I asked for forgiveness?

33:14.533 --> 33:15.500
Don't you think

33:17.633 --> 33:19.033
we've come too far

33:20.233 --> 33:22.200
to reconcile?

33:25.766 --> 33:27.033
Stop the nonsense

33:27.533 --> 33:29.400
and say you're sorry!

33:31.066 --> 33:32.400
Beg for forgiveness

33:33.100 --> 33:36.600
to every life you took away!

33:38.100 --> 33:39.133
I've never done anything

33:43.333 --> 33:45.266
to seek forgiveness for.

33:47.533 --> 33:49.333
I made all the choices

33:51.400 --> 33:53.033
based on my principles

33:54.600 --> 33:56.033
and beliefs.

33:56.100 --> 33:56.966
Shut up!

34:00.200 --> 34:01.466
Do you know the true colors

34:03.000 --> 34:04.200
of Iris you worship?

34:06.566 --> 34:08.766
It's nothing but a religion
for those evil ones

34:09.766 --> 34:11.733
who sold their souls for money and power.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.000
Your principles and beliefs

34:16.833 --> 34:17.733
are nothing more

34:19.766 --> 34:21.166
than filthy greed after all.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.633
What do you live for?

34:27.100 --> 34:29.000
Humans are all the same.

34:29.966 --> 34:31.133
I told you

34:33.266 --> 34:34.199
that you ate

34:34.566 --> 34:37.699
the forbidden fruit
and fell under punishment.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.933
Don't forget
that your punishment isn't over yet.

34:42.966 --> 34:45.933
Just like your parents and Jeong-hoon Yoo
were killed by my hands,

34:48.100 --> 34:49.333
you'll die in the same manner.

34:49.699 --> 34:51.733
You won't be able to find out anything

34:52.466 --> 34:54.233
until your last breath.

34:59.466 --> 35:00.533
You'll never know about me

35:03.866 --> 35:05.633
and about Iris.

35:15.366 --> 35:16.266
Stop it!

35:21.800 --> 35:22.900
If you kill him now,

35:23.766 --> 35:25.933
we can't find more about Iris.

35:27.533 --> 35:28.500
Hyun-jun.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.233
Listen to me.

35:31.033 --> 35:33.000
Death would be his best-case scenario.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.166
If you let the law judge him,

35:35.533 --> 35:36.933
he'll suffer greater pain.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.633
Listen to me.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.400
Hyun-jun!

36:20.133 --> 36:21.166
Arrest him.

36:34.433 --> 36:35.433
Seung-hee.

36:37.733 --> 36:38.766
Seung-hee Choi.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.766
You seem like you're in another world.

36:42.966 --> 36:45.433
Drink some herbal tea
and refresh yourself.

36:45.666 --> 36:46.633
Thanks.

36:47.766 --> 36:49.533
You know you've been
acting strange lately?

36:50.000 --> 36:50.900
What do you mean?

36:51.733 --> 36:53.166
Since your trip to Jeju Island,

36:53.233 --> 36:54.400
you've been acting weird.

36:54.466 --> 36:55.766
You look anxious

36:55.833 --> 36:57.266
and perturbed.

36:59.666 --> 37:02.133
Hyun-jun, the one you'd been aching for
is back safely.

37:02.900 --> 37:04.633
Why are you so anxious?

37:06.533 --> 37:07.500
What's the matter?

37:08.900 --> 37:10.333
You got it wrong.

37:10.766 --> 37:12.066
I'm totally fine.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.400
That's a relief.

37:18.466 --> 37:20.733
The situation is cleared up.

37:22.133 --> 37:23.366
Director Baek is arrested.

37:24.800 --> 37:25.766
What about Sa-woo Jin?

37:25.866 --> 37:27.366
I heard that Sa-woo and others

37:27.500 --> 37:28.833
have already escaped from the scene.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.266
Any loss on our side?

37:30.666 --> 37:31.733
Is everyone safe?

37:31.800 --> 37:32.700
Yes.

37:33.633 --> 37:35.900
Hyun-jun is all right.

37:43.066 --> 37:45.166
Remaining soldiers on the scene
have all been shot dead,

37:45.866 --> 37:47.266
and San Baek who was shot

37:47.966 --> 37:49.233
is undergoing operation now.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Where is he?

37:53.966 --> 37:55.166
I'm sorry,

37:55.666 --> 37:57.100
but it's confidential.

37:57.466 --> 37:58.766
It's not because I don't trust you,

37:59.533 --> 38:00.600
but it's critical

38:01.000 --> 38:02.633
to assure security this time.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
Still,

38:04.800 --> 38:07.933
-President Cho might ask--
-I'll tell him myself.

38:10.166 --> 38:11.533
Be that as it may,

38:12.433 --> 38:13.466
is it

38:14.133 --> 38:15.300
all over now?

38:15.500 --> 38:16.566
No.

38:17.733 --> 38:20.200
The former NSS agent Sa-woo Jin
and his accomplices

38:20.566 --> 38:22.066
have already escaped from the scene.

38:22.766 --> 38:24.033
We have yet to identify

38:24.666 --> 38:25.833
what they want.

38:26.266 --> 38:28.333
You mean it's still not over yet?

38:37.500 --> 38:39.400
HYUN-KYU OH FORENSIC SCIENCE DIVISION

38:43.833 --> 38:44.733
Yes, sir.

38:44.866 --> 38:46.333
Come over to the forensic science lab.

38:46.600 --> 38:47.666
I got something to show you.

39:20.833 --> 39:21.733
Hey.

39:23.533 --> 39:26.033
I found this from
the video surveillance data

39:26.100 --> 39:28.066
we collected from the clubhouse.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.133
You're the first one I'm showing this to.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.366
Well...

39:32.433 --> 39:35.133
I really have no idea

39:36.033 --> 39:38.066
what's going on here.

39:45.066 --> 39:46.266
Just take a look.

40:53.266 --> 40:54.333
Director Baek

40:54.766 --> 40:55.866
is taken into custody.

40:57.533 --> 40:58.600
He got shot

40:59.233 --> 41:00.400
and is undergoing operation.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.633
Where is he?

41:02.766 --> 41:03.666
I failed

41:04.500 --> 41:05.966
to find that out.

41:07.933 --> 41:09.700
The remaining soldiers at the clubhouse

41:11.100 --> 41:12.366
are all shot dead.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.700
There is someone

41:20.900 --> 41:22.533
you should meet with.

42:15.633 --> 42:18.033
There's no need for you to be disturbed
by San Baek's arrest.

42:21.133 --> 42:22.333
Who are you?

42:22.833 --> 42:24.500
I'm the one who'll save you.

42:25.100 --> 42:26.033
In the organization,

42:26.566 --> 42:28.366
they call me Black.

42:45.133 --> 42:46.400
Above all,

42:47.066 --> 42:48.666
let me tell you one last thing.

42:51.233 --> 42:55.000
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

42:55.633 --> 43:00.533
I guarantee you that it's worth to stake

43:01.600 --> 43:02.900
your entire life.

43:04.533 --> 43:05.533
I'm sure

43:06.200 --> 43:07.900
you can rise to a higher position

43:09.066 --> 43:10.333
than me.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.900
The headquarters

43:13.400 --> 43:15.833
decided to transfer San Baek's authority
to you.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.366
You will replace

43:19.366 --> 43:21.533
San Baek.

43:52.666 --> 43:53.766
Are you busy?

43:55.566 --> 43:56.966
Yes, a little.

43:58.366 --> 43:59.366
Why don't we

44:00.066 --> 44:01.200
have dinner together tonight?

44:29.133 --> 44:30.333
How come you're not eating?

44:31.266 --> 44:32.200
I just feel like

44:33.300 --> 44:34.400
I'm having

44:35.666 --> 44:37.833
the last supper.

44:40.066 --> 44:41.600
I don't know why you took me here

44:42.300 --> 44:43.900
when we're extremely busy,

44:44.966 --> 44:47.133
or what you're about to say.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.733
What if you say something too harsh
for me to bear?

44:53.033 --> 44:54.000
Well...

44:54.966 --> 44:56.900
Things like that are really bothering me.

44:58.233 --> 44:59.333
Looking back,

45:00.766 --> 45:02.000
I haven't taken you

45:03.100 --> 45:04.100
to a nice restaurant

45:04.166 --> 45:06.766
since we first met. That's why I asked you
out to dinner tonight.

45:08.666 --> 45:09.866
So make yourself comfortable.

45:44.533 --> 45:45.766
I know

45:46.233 --> 45:48.133
what you're curious about,

45:49.566 --> 45:50.766
so I'll tell you.

45:54.266 --> 45:55.200
In Jeju Island,

45:57.066 --> 45:58.033
I--

45:58.100 --> 45:59.266
Hold on.

46:00.533 --> 46:01.833
Let me talk first.

46:04.166 --> 46:05.300
I'm afraid

46:08.733 --> 46:11.866
that you might say something different
from what I know.

46:15.166 --> 46:16.133
I know

46:19.333 --> 46:20.633
where you had been

46:21.533 --> 46:23.400
and who you had met

46:24.733 --> 46:26.100
from the time you disappeared

46:26.933 --> 46:28.100
in Jeju Island until

46:30.533 --> 46:31.566
you returned to the NSS.

46:36.333 --> 46:37.833
I saw something I found too hard

46:39.533 --> 46:40.933
to believe with my eyes.

46:46.833 --> 46:48.033
Just as my life

46:48.900 --> 46:50.466
was drawn to an uncontrollable destiny

46:51.666 --> 46:53.433
because of some conspiracy I didn't know,

46:54.433 --> 46:55.733
I think you may be

46:58.233 --> 47:00.100
in the same situation now.

47:01.666 --> 47:03.000
In order to help you,

47:04.000 --> 47:05.066
I must know everything.

47:06.633 --> 47:07.566
So please,

47:10.066 --> 47:11.766
tell me the truth now.

47:13.033 --> 47:14.133
Seung-hee,

47:15.566 --> 47:17.733
you and San Baek, no wait.

47:19.300 --> 47:20.600
What do you have to do

47:23.400 --> 47:24.600
with Iris?

47:52.166 --> 47:53.066
Yes.

47:56.933 --> 47:58.266
I'll tell him right away.

48:00.666 --> 48:01.866
We have a problem.

48:02.566 --> 48:03.566
What is it?

48:03.633 --> 48:05.300
Soman gas cylinder number four

48:05.833 --> 48:07.833
is gone from the underground bunker
in District 12.

48:09.933 --> 48:11.700
It's confirmed
by the Defense Security Command.

48:12.733 --> 48:15.900
It's believed to be smuggled out
and fell into the hands of Iris.

48:20.466 --> 48:22.033
As you know,

48:23.533 --> 48:24.666
I met with

48:25.766 --> 48:27.400
Director Baek.

48:29.733 --> 48:30.766
And there was

48:32.633 --> 48:34.700
the head of Iris

48:36.233 --> 48:38.200
who hands down orders to Director Baek
as well.

48:40.833 --> 48:42.600
Director Baek

48:44.366 --> 48:47.066
asked me to work for Iris,

48:49.633 --> 48:51.066
and I declined his request.

48:52.066 --> 48:53.333
Why would Director Baek

48:54.066 --> 48:55.533
make such a request to you?

48:56.866 --> 49:00.166
Please explain your relationship
with him, so I may understand.

49:02.600 --> 49:04.233
It was my father

49:05.200 --> 49:06.700
who founded the NSS.

49:08.300 --> 49:10.933
My father, who was an agent
of Central Intelligence Agency,

49:12.400 --> 49:13.966
established the NSS

49:14.466 --> 49:16.233
upon President Park's order.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.400
After President Park
had been assassinated,

49:19.900 --> 49:21.633
my father was executed

49:23.833 --> 49:25.100
for his involvement there.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.466
Think about it.

49:33.033 --> 49:35.300
My father was executed for taking part

49:37.033 --> 49:38.700
in the president's assassination plot.

49:39.566 --> 49:41.733
Imagine how harsh the world would've been
to me and my mom

49:43.766 --> 49:45.600
who had to live with the stigma.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.200
Although I don't remember well
because I was too young,

49:53.866 --> 49:56.033
when we couldn't even afford to live

49:56.500 --> 49:58.266
and there was no one to help us.

49:59.033 --> 50:00.433
It was Director Baek

50:01.833 --> 50:03.266
who gave us a helping hand.

50:04.866 --> 50:06.866
I could continue studying,

50:07.800 --> 50:09.300
enter college,

50:10.633 --> 50:12.633
and work for the NSS,

50:13.933 --> 50:15.466
all thanks to Director Baek's care

50:16.566 --> 50:17.766
and help.

50:20.500 --> 50:21.633
I've never doubted his words

50:23.033 --> 50:25.566
that he was helping us

50:27.533 --> 50:29.133
out of his respect for my father.

50:31.466 --> 50:32.400
But

50:34.233 --> 50:35.700
I really didn't know

50:37.200 --> 50:38.400
San Baek was working for Iris

50:39.766 --> 50:41.500
and that the helping hand

50:44.000 --> 50:45.100
was Iris after all.

50:49.066 --> 50:50.366
So when this San Baek

50:52.833 --> 50:54.400
disclosed his identity

50:55.366 --> 50:57.033
and asked me to work for Iris--

50:57.100 --> 50:58.266
Stop, wait.

51:09.433 --> 51:10.566
Why didn't you...

51:10.633 --> 51:12.300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

51:18.333 --> 51:19.566
How could I tell you?

51:21.166 --> 51:23.466
The one who was like my father

51:25.500 --> 51:28.033
turned out to be the murderer
of your parents.

51:30.533 --> 51:32.166
How could I have told you

51:33.900 --> 51:35.933
about the relationship between me and him?

51:37.433 --> 51:38.366
He told me

51:40.100 --> 51:41.466
to join Iris

51:43.333 --> 51:45.066
and kill you.

51:46.633 --> 51:48.266
How could I possibly

51:50.500 --> 51:51.600
tell you about...

52:14.966 --> 52:16.666
San Baek once said this to me.

52:19.466 --> 52:20.566
My life

52:21.266 --> 52:23.166
has worked out as he designed.

52:24.900 --> 52:26.800
I'm sure he'd felt the same thing
for your life.

52:28.833 --> 52:29.700
Still,

52:32.900 --> 52:34.433
you've made a wise choice

52:36.133 --> 52:37.500
and that makes me very relieved.

52:54.466 --> 52:55.700
How did it go?

52:58.333 --> 52:59.866
Director Baek is arrested,

53:01.500 --> 53:03.100
and the remaining members are killed.

53:03.566 --> 53:04.766
What happens to our operation?

53:08.900 --> 53:09.833
I'll be giving

53:10.300 --> 53:11.566
orders in place of Director Baek,

53:13.400 --> 53:14.766
and it will be carried out as planned.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.633
I'm working

53:34.500 --> 53:36.200
under direct orders from the headquarters.

53:37.466 --> 53:39.066
Disobeying my orders

53:40.566 --> 53:42.533
is the same as disobeying
orders of the headquarters.

53:45.066 --> 53:46.266
Once again,

53:47.333 --> 53:48.433
we'll proceed

53:49.133 --> 53:50.466
with the operation as planned.

53:54.533 --> 53:56.533
Do we have no clue
who took it away to where?

53:56.866 --> 53:58.866
The Defense Security Command
conducted an investigation,

53:59.766 --> 54:02.133
yet failed to find out anything
except that it might have fallen

54:02.766 --> 54:04.066
into the hands of Iris.

54:06.633 --> 54:08.766
Have you found Sa-woo Jin
and the soldiers?

54:10.733 --> 54:13.400
Based on the information that Iris
is planning another terror attack,

54:14.033 --> 54:15.733
and considering the size and the armament

54:16.000 --> 54:18.600
they have in the South,

54:19.266 --> 54:20.633
the soman gas that disappeared

54:21.100 --> 54:23.033
must have something to do with their plan.

54:24.066 --> 54:25.500
As the toxic effect of soman in gas form

54:26.266 --> 54:27.900
doesn't last long,

54:28.433 --> 54:30.566
it's more effective indoors.

54:31.733 --> 54:33.300
When do the North's VIPs arrive in Seoul?

54:33.900 --> 54:35.000
Tomorrow.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.866
The press conference is scheduled
on the next day.

54:41.133 --> 54:42.433
We must find Sa-Woo

54:43.066 --> 54:44.300
and the soldiers first.

54:44.766 --> 54:47.933
As long as we know that biochemical weapon
can be used in the terror attack,

54:48.633 --> 54:49.900
we must stop the summit

54:50.933 --> 54:53.066
unless we come up with a solution.

55:04.166 --> 55:05.333
Did you tell Seung-hee

55:05.766 --> 55:06.766
about that?

55:09.500 --> 55:10.666
Did you tell her

55:11.800 --> 55:13.866
that she might be a target
of the terror attack?

55:16.533 --> 55:17.800
If we can't find out why the file

55:17.866 --> 55:19.166
contained her name--

55:19.233 --> 55:20.333
Now I know

55:22.300 --> 55:23.266
the reason.

55:25.700 --> 55:26.633
What is it?

55:35.133 --> 55:36.666
You don't need to worry about it anymore.

55:39.533 --> 55:40.600
Bye.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.166
HALLYU EXHIBITION OPEN MART & OUTLET SALE

57:22.766 --> 57:23.833
You can't be here.

57:24.766 --> 57:26.333
Lower all the firewalls inside the mall

57:26.733 --> 57:28.733
and shut down all the gates to outside.

57:33.633 --> 57:34.966
Did you say hostage?

57:35.233 --> 57:36.266
Yes, Sir.

57:36.766 --> 57:39.433
Armed men took over the entire mall,

57:40.766 --> 57:42.566
holding citizens hostage.

57:42.766 --> 57:44.000
Do we know who the captors are,

57:44.100 --> 57:45.866
and the total number of hostages?

57:46.000 --> 57:47.200
We don't have the exact number,

57:47.633 --> 57:48.633
but we know

57:49.100 --> 57:50.566
that it's over a hundred.

57:52.166 --> 57:53.733
What are their demands?

57:53.966 --> 57:55.100
We haven't figured...

57:55.766 --> 57:56.700
We're trying every means

57:56.766 --> 57:58.133
to make contact with them.

58:01.233 --> 58:02.766
Never open your mouths.

58:03.166 --> 58:05.166
If you say something you're not told
to say, you'll die.

58:05.566 --> 58:07.566
If you do something you're not told to do,
you'll die.

58:07.700 --> 58:09.533
If you follow my instructions,

58:10.266 --> 58:11.466
you can get out of here alive.

58:11.533 --> 58:12.533
Now,

58:12.733 --> 58:14.200
hand over all the electronic devices

58:14.600 --> 58:16.433
including cell phones,

58:16.500 --> 58:18.466
cameras and PDAs.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.833
If you don't hand over now,

58:20.466 --> 58:22.033
and get caught contacting the outside,

58:22.466 --> 58:23.833
we'll kill you immediately.

58:25.433 --> 58:26.533
Hurry! Move!

58:27.300 --> 58:28.500
-Keep your heads down!
-Hurry!

58:28.566 --> 58:30.200
I didn't tell you to put your heads up!

58:30.900 --> 58:32.000
-Hurry up.
-Stay down!

58:32.733 --> 58:33.733
Give it to me!

58:36.000 --> 58:36.833
Hurry up!

59:13.733 --> 59:14.966
We took the central control room

59:15.100 --> 59:16.766
and blocked all the exits.

59:17.166 --> 59:18.833
We can control the whole building
from here.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.333
Next.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.666
The total number of hostages is 107.

59:40.733 --> 59:43.900
We set booby traps
in every passage connected to outside

59:43.966 --> 59:47.466
on the basement, and on the first
and the second floors.

59:51.366 --> 59:53.100
Since we don't have enough information yet

59:53.166 --> 59:54.400
the exact numbers are hard to say.

59:54.866 --> 59:56.500
But it's estimated to be about a hundred.

59:56.900 --> 59:57.966
What about the captors?

59:58.466 --> 1:00:00.133
We don't know their number
and their identity.

1:00:00.900 --> 1:00:02.133
The police and the SWAT

1:00:02.566 --> 1:00:03.700
have the building surrounded,

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:05.366
and our SWAT is on standby now.

1:00:13.033 --> 1:00:15.233
I'm Hyun-jun Kim, an agent
of the NSS Counter-terrorism team.

1:00:32.966 --> 1:00:34.966
Alpha's at the stairway.

1:00:35.366 --> 1:00:37.166
Scanning the situation before entering.

1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:40.533
Check the booby traps at each entrance
every 30 minutes.

1:00:40.866 --> 1:00:43.333
We can check the signals of sensors here.

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:45.233
Check with your eyes and report.

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:46.766
Yes, sir.

1:00:46.833 --> 1:00:48.100
Connect the video surveillance to

1:00:48.166 --> 1:00:50.300
the central hall so that the members
in action can watch.

1:00:50.366 --> 1:00:51.333
Yes, sir.

1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:53.600
Report the situation on your position
every 30 minutes.

1:00:54.966 --> 1:00:55.900
That's all.

1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:40.866
This...

1:01:42.100 --> 1:01:43.300
Deliver our demands

1:01:43.733 --> 1:01:44.766
as we've planned.

1:01:44.866 --> 1:01:46.066
This is a punishment

1:01:46.133 --> 1:01:47.466
for breaking in.

1:01:49.266 --> 1:01:51.300
-Sa-woo, how can you--
-We both have come

1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:54.000
too far.

1:01:55.833 --> 1:01:56.933
This isn't you.

1:02:04.833 --> 1:02:05.733
Seung-hee Choi?

1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:07.233
She's not here either.

1:02:07.300 --> 1:02:09.433
I'm Seung-hee Choi,
the NSS Counter-terrorism Team Leader.

1:02:10.366 --> 1:02:12.066
I want to check Code One's movement.

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:14.766
We killed the wrong people.
