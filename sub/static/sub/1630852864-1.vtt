SEOBOK

03:34.660 --> 03:35.830
Shit!

04:42.030 --> 04:44.200
It's been confirmed. It
was a terrorist attack.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.460
<i>Who could they be?</i>

04:46.490 --> 04:49.040
We don't have any leads yet

04:49.910 --> 04:52.280
but we're certain the
project has been exposed.

04:55.910 --> 04:57.290
What are you going to do?

04:57.750 --> 04:59.750
The project needs to be
moved to a safer location.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.000
<i>Moved?</i>

05:01.000 --> 05:04.170
That's out of the question.
We're in the final stages.

05:04.170 --> 05:08.340
Isn't project security
the top priority?

05:09.260 --> 05:11.630
The chance of another attack is high

05:11.640 --> 05:13.850
and the target is obvious.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.600
You need to make a decision.

05:18.850 --> 05:22.900
Okay, but under one condition.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.270
You can't just show up like this.

05:45.460 --> 05:47.880
I haven't slept in two days
because of the headaches.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.910
A man needs to sleep to live, okay?

06:03.020 --> 06:06.970
I'm saying this because
I'm worried about you...

06:07.000 --> 06:09.320
- If you keep on this way...
- Shit, I'm not going to die!

06:11.130 --> 06:13.230
I won't let this kill me.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.290
What...

07:46.290 --> 07:47.890
Mr. Min Ki-hun?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.460
I'm with the company.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.600
Where are you taking me?

08:04.100 --> 08:05.310
Who sent you?

08:22.950 --> 08:24.080
This way.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.580
You're still alive.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.080
Did you miss me?

08:31.600 --> 08:33.440
I guess that's a no.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.760
It's been two years.
You're not happy to see me?

08:37.980 --> 08:40.530
You brought me here?

08:40.549 --> 08:43.260
What the hell do you want?

08:45.330 --> 08:48.200
Don't get all jumpy.
It's not a good look.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.040
By the way, you look like shit.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.710
Just tell me what you want.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.170
I'm not the one who called you.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.480
Ki-hun.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.320
Long time. How are you feeling?

09:20.110 --> 09:21.400
I'm fine.

09:21.400 --> 09:27.830
That's good to hear. I
need you to do a job for me.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.750
What kind of a job?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.870
A job for your country, of course.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.590
I don't work for the company anymore.

09:42.420 --> 09:45.930
I need someone I can trust.

09:47.970 --> 09:49.890
I'm that someone for you?

09:54.270 --> 09:55.480
Aren't you?

10:05.150 --> 10:07.490
Do you still remember
the day Hyun-soo passed?

10:08.830 --> 10:13.790
It's been three years,
hasn't it? Time flies, huh?

10:24.670 --> 10:26.300
<i>What is the job?</i>

10:27.220 --> 10:30.850
It involves a classified
project of national importance.

10:30.850 --> 10:32.390
That's all you need to know.

10:52.370 --> 10:56.410
You must be Min. Director
Ahn told me about you.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.500
I'm Dr. Shin Hak-sun.

11:01.590 --> 11:05.170
We raised the security level
due to a recent terrorist attack.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.890
We don't think they
hit their real target.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.960
Sir, the data is out.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.680
What is all this?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.020
Research for the future.

12:04.190 --> 12:08.240
So, this ship is a research lab?

12:08.240 --> 12:09.360
Correct.

12:10.490 --> 12:14.990
Why would you carry out
work like this on a ship?

12:15.580 --> 12:18.000
Consider it a kind of ark.

12:26.460 --> 12:30.180
Let me introduce you to
Dr. Lim. She's in charge here.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.940
Ten years ago, we successfully cultured

12:35.960 --> 12:38.810
genetically manipulated
embryonic stem cells.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.750
We inserted the
hematopoietic stem cells into

12:42.770 --> 12:45.870
a fertilized egg through
nuclear replacements

12:46.150 --> 12:49.120
then the egg was implanted into a womb.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.450
After a seven month pregnancy,
the specimen was created.

12:53.450 --> 12:56.120
The male specimen grew at a speed

12:56.120 --> 12:57.490
twice the regular rate
of an average human...

12:57.490 --> 12:59.290
Hang on, hang on...

13:00.620 --> 13:06.800
Specimen? What is that?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.310
Can you open the window?

13:25.230 --> 13:28.730
This boy is the first ever
human specimen created

13:28.730 --> 13:30.780
through stem cell cloning
and genetic manipulation.

13:32.450 --> 13:36.160
Are you saying he's a cloned human?

13:36.160 --> 13:40.430
I don't know if we can call him human.

13:40.660 --> 13:44.080
If potato roots sprout
from a tomato plant,

13:44.080 --> 13:45.670
what should we call them?

13:46.670 --> 13:49.710
He has special genes
nonexistent in humans.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.710
He's a new species, if you like.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.270
He's our first successful case.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.810
In the early days, cloning was simply
creating exact copies of the original DNA.

14:09.270 --> 14:11.360
But Seobok is different.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.030
His genes were entirely modified
through genetic manipulation.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.200
Seobok?

14:18.200 --> 14:21.960
Oh, that's the specimen's name.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.790
2,500 years ago,

14:27.790 --> 14:32.670
Emperor Qin sent off his servant to
search for the elixir of immortality.

14:32.670 --> 14:35.670
That servant represents
humanity's desire to overcome death.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.260
Seobok was named after him.

14:42.810 --> 14:46.230
Seobok is an undying being.

14:52.730 --> 14:58.450
His bone marrow produces IPS cells,
which are dedifferentiating stem cells.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.200
His IPS proteins can cure
any and all human diseases.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.080
Through him, humans can conquer death.

15:08.920 --> 15:13.290
With Anderson gone, Seobok is the only
existing source of this technology.

15:13.290 --> 15:15.760
He must be protected at all costs.

15:18.970 --> 15:21.760
This is...

15:22.560 --> 15:25.020
I know it's hard to believe.

15:25.980 --> 15:29.600
This is ridiculous.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.310
It's not like you can
see that he doesn't die.

15:32.310 --> 15:35.530
He looks like an ordinary kid.

15:36.110 --> 15:37.810
He's anything but.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.780
Let me show you something.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.450
You may begin.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.180
It's an unexpected side effect.

16:44.590 --> 16:47.730
We don't fully understand
how it's possible.

16:48.270 --> 16:52.020
Seobok has brainwaves
far more powerful than us,

16:52.020 --> 16:56.610
so we can only assume he
controls the pressure around him.

16:57.610 --> 16:59.480
That's far from ordinary.

17:00.900 --> 17:06.940
I guess it's interesting,
sort of like magic.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.380
You can stop now.

17:36.310 --> 17:40.730
It happens frequently, gets
worse when stressed or fatigued?

17:41.780 --> 17:44.040
Loss of consciousness
due to a brain tumor.

17:45.410 --> 17:47.990
Is it glioblastoma?

17:49.080 --> 17:53.750
You have what, six
months to a year at best?

17:53.750 --> 17:55.250
Mind your own business.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.250
I'm offering a clinical trial.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.300
I can treat you using Seobok.

18:02.340 --> 18:05.800
I can save your life.

18:10.140 --> 18:13.470
When the Hwang scandal destroyed
the stem cell research environment,

18:13.470 --> 18:15.770
Seoin approached us.

18:15.770 --> 18:18.880
They'd help us if we help them
with their human cloning research.

18:19.190 --> 18:21.480
Help you with what?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.910
You know what happened that year.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.870
The government then
didn't think much of it.

18:28.870 --> 18:31.780
They could use the money from Seoin

18:31.790 --> 18:35.000
and take credit for the
work if it succeeded.

18:36.630 --> 18:38.670
But it produced an unexpected outcome.

18:40.130 --> 18:41.760
An undying specimen.

18:43.300 --> 18:48.420
<i>They had to study the
specimen to determine its nature</i>

18:48.430 --> 18:51.010
<i>and ten years passed just like that.</i>

18:52.600 --> 18:54.980
Frankly, we had forgotten about it

18:56.310 --> 18:59.730
until Anderson was killed last night.

19:00.480 --> 19:04.070
He was due to submit
the final report next month.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.160
Who's behind it?

19:07.160 --> 19:09.160
It could've been anyone.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.700
After all, this is a powerful weapon.

19:11.740 --> 19:12.990
Weapon?

19:12.990 --> 19:16.330
What do you think a weapon is?

19:17.670 --> 19:20.460
The essence of a weapon is fear.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.000
The fear that it can kill you.

19:24.420 --> 19:26.710
<i>A technology of immortality</i>

19:26.720 --> 19:30.680
<i>is a powerful weapon for
everyone who fears death.</i>

19:32.680 --> 19:34.640
<i>And all men die,</i>

19:36.520 --> 19:38.020
just like you.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.400
We're moving the
specimen to a secret bunker.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.690
Seoin wants to conduct
a clinical trial there.

19:46.700 --> 19:52.160
<i>We need a participant for the trial,
someone who's not a security liability.</i>

19:53.530 --> 19:55.080
That's why I contacted you.

19:57.370 --> 20:00.500
So, what do you say?

20:08.210 --> 20:09.880
<i>I'll do it.</i>

20:10.720 --> 20:12.220
<i>Let me be a part of it.</i>

20:28.070 --> 20:30.610
What are they injecting him with?

20:31.490 --> 20:32.490
An inhibitor.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.120
What for?

20:36.530 --> 20:41.000
To suppress cell
division, which is too rapid.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.540
Like an anticancer drug?

20:47.840 --> 20:49.010
Yes, exactly.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.680
He needs one every 24 hours.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.180
He gets one every day?

20:57.180 --> 21:01.780
Yes, otherwise the cell division
process will spiral out of control.

21:02.190 --> 21:03.230
What happens then?

21:04.540 --> 21:05.620
He'll die.

21:06.980 --> 21:08.990
But you said he can't die.

21:08.990 --> 21:11.570
Of course he can.

21:11.570 --> 21:14.740
Wouldn't he die if he
was shot or hit by a car?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.410
He's not invincible.

21:25.580 --> 21:28.460
I heard you'll take part in the trial.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.960
Yes.

21:31.970 --> 21:34.170
Congratulations.

21:34.180 --> 21:39.170
I don't know if it's something
to be congratulated for.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.940
How likely are the chances of success?

21:45.860 --> 21:48.070
Since it's the first
trial, no one knows.

21:48.820 --> 21:53.780
If it fails... what happens to me?

21:57.870 --> 22:00.040
Worst case scenario, you die,

22:00.040 --> 22:03.330
which will happen anyway.

22:04.460 --> 22:08.790
<i>Preparation for relocation ready.</i>

22:14.430 --> 22:18.390
People are so easily scared,
aren't they? And greedy as well.

22:25.150 --> 22:27.400
What a...

22:29.900 --> 22:32.650
Smoking in a room and shit...

22:48.040 --> 22:50.040
Don't worry, we'll be there soon.

22:52.050 --> 22:55.800
We're going to be spending a
lot of time together. I'm Min Ki-hun.

22:58.550 --> 22:59.760
Mr. Min Ki-hun?

23:05.190 --> 23:09.060
You don't have to be
formal. Just call me Ki-hun.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.400
Ever used that before?

23:15.240 --> 23:16.780
This? Of course.

23:18.820 --> 23:21.030
I'm quite a good shot.

23:22.740 --> 23:23.910
On a person?

23:25.580 --> 23:30.670
Did he die? How many have you killed?

23:32.790 --> 23:34.050
Why do you want to know?

23:41.430 --> 23:42.430
What's going on?

23:43.430 --> 23:46.310
<i>It's an ambulance.
We'll give way for it.</i>

23:50.190 --> 23:52.940
Are we changing routes?

23:52.970 --> 23:57.320
There's been an accident,
so we're making a detour.

23:57.690 --> 23:58.820
Copy.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.790
Min's onto us. What should we do?

24:05.790 --> 24:09.210
Don't worry about
him. How much longer?

24:09.210 --> 24:10.880
<i>ETA 30 minutes.</i>

24:10.880 --> 24:16.460
Okay. Keep him distracted. The
Americans will be waiting for you.

24:16.470 --> 24:19.180
They'll take it from there.

24:19.180 --> 24:22.050
Get out of there after contact
and report to me right away.

24:23.390 --> 24:26.010
What do we do with Min?

24:26.020 --> 24:28.730
Hand him over too. The
Americans will take care of him.

24:29.230 --> 24:30.640
Yes sir.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.320
What the hell?

24:56.040 --> 24:57.200
What's going on?!

25:08.850 --> 25:11.940
Who the hell are those men?!

25:16.900 --> 25:17.900
No!

25:35.170 --> 25:36.170
What...

25:53.100 --> 25:56.360
- No one's answering?
- They're offline, sir.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.730
Dammit...

26:16.310 --> 26:17.760
Are you there?

26:17.790 --> 26:18.960
Yes.

26:21.470 --> 26:23.390
Where are we?

26:23.410 --> 26:25.080
I don't know.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.470
Who were those men?

26:27.220 --> 26:28.140
I don't know.

26:28.140 --> 26:30.890
You saw nothing?
What the hell happened?

26:32.310 --> 26:33.890
You fell asleep, Mr. Min.

26:50.030 --> 26:51.110
Who's that?

26:52.290 --> 26:53.750
The men from earlier.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.000
Who are you?

27:05.470 --> 27:06.800
No.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.340
What's happening?

27:08.350 --> 27:10.010
I said no.

27:11.010 --> 27:12.100
He says no.

29:21.770 --> 29:22.770
Hold on!

29:48.130 --> 29:49.300
<i>And the specimen?</i>

29:49.300 --> 29:50.300
He's fine.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.750
What's your location?

29:56.220 --> 29:57.310
Near Boeun, in Chungbuk Province.

29:57.310 --> 29:59.080
What's the nearest safe house?

29:59.630 --> 30:00.630
Now!

30:01.310 --> 30:03.980
- Point 14, sir. Five kilometers away.
- Show me.

30:05.310 --> 30:07.650
Jangam-ri 585, Deungcheon.

30:07.650 --> 30:08.820
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

30:08.820 --> 30:10.230
Yeah, Jangam-ri 585.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.910
Go there. I'll dispatch
backup right away.

30:12.910 --> 30:13.930
<i>Yes sir.</i>

30:22.700 --> 30:24.490
Where are we going?

30:24.730 --> 30:26.980
It's still dangerous. We
need to get to safety.

30:27.380 --> 30:29.420
- Why is it dangerous?
- What?

30:30.760 --> 30:32.090
Shit!

30:39.180 --> 30:42.520
We'll have to walk.

30:46.740 --> 30:48.360
Come on, what are you doing?

30:48.480 --> 30:49.820
Why is it dangerous?

30:53.360 --> 30:54.740
There's no time for this.

30:57.490 --> 30:58.610
Hey...

30:58.620 --> 30:59.790
Hey!

31:01.740 --> 31:03.600
Why am I in danger?

31:04.370 --> 31:07.380
You saw earlier. Bad
guys are after you.

31:07.380 --> 31:11.500
Why? Why are they after me?

31:11.530 --> 31:13.570
What do you mean why?
Because you're the sp...

31:14.880 --> 31:16.510
Because I'm the specimen?

31:19.680 --> 31:21.470
Because I don't die?

31:29.400 --> 31:31.410
I guess you already know.

31:31.900 --> 31:36.400
The bad guys are trying to
steal the technology from you.

31:36.410 --> 31:39.070
That's why you're in danger. Okay?

31:42.580 --> 31:44.380
Men are so foolish.

31:45.260 --> 31:49.550
What are you talking about?
We don't have time for this.

31:52.550 --> 31:55.800
How do I know you're not a bad guy?

31:58.430 --> 31:59.820
Do I look like one?

32:00.720 --> 32:02.240
You don't look like a good guy either.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.610
Why do you think I'm
going through this shit?

32:06.310 --> 32:07.390
Why?

32:07.390 --> 32:09.860
To protect you! Can't you see that?

32:10.980 --> 32:14.690
Why are you trying to protect me?

32:17.950 --> 32:19.960
Because my life depends on it.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.870
You gonna do this?

33:04.870 --> 33:06.830
- Come at me, then!
- Come here!

33:13.750 --> 33:15.040
Hurry up already.

33:41.430 --> 33:44.120
We can't just stop. We
need to keep moving.

33:51.250 --> 33:52.910
Can't we go slower?

33:54.330 --> 33:55.880
What for?

33:55.880 --> 33:57.170
So I can look around.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.380
Look around?

34:01.010 --> 34:05.180
Look, we don't have time for that.

34:20.900 --> 34:21.900
Hey...

34:24.320 --> 34:25.320
Hey!

34:36.960 --> 34:38.040
Holy crap.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.380
Who are you?

34:49.760 --> 34:50.760
Who is it?

34:52.790 --> 34:54.440
Just some kid.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.100
He looks like... he's not all there.

35:06.570 --> 35:08.030
Where do you live?

35:09.870 --> 35:12.290
Your mom... where is she?

35:14.500 --> 35:16.960
What the hell are you doing?

35:16.960 --> 35:18.630
Ah, you're with your brother.

35:18.630 --> 35:23.630
You should take better care of
him. He looks like he needs it.

35:23.630 --> 35:26.510
Don't let him walk around
looking like a lost puppy.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.510
Come with me.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.860
You...

35:53.580 --> 35:54.580
Hello?

35:55.500 --> 35:56.500
Anybody?

36:01.500 --> 36:02.920
Good thinking.

36:02.920 --> 36:06.510
He'll look much better in nice
clothes. You're a good brother.

36:07.420 --> 36:08.550
Try on whatever you like.

36:12.850 --> 36:16.890
It's 74 dollars, but let's call it 73.

36:16.890 --> 36:19.100
Your little brother is so handsome.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.370
He knows his fashion too.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.650
Hey! Get away from the window.

38:06.590 --> 38:10.460
Don't touch anything. Just stay put.

38:39.190 --> 38:40.360
What are you doing?

38:42.520 --> 38:44.730
You told me to stay put, Mr. Min.

38:45.370 --> 38:47.220
Well, be quiet. You're distracting me.

38:51.550 --> 38:53.470
And stop calling me Mr. Min.

38:54.050 --> 38:57.220
I'm not your teacher.

39:00.220 --> 39:01.680
I have a question.

39:04.150 --> 39:05.150
What?

39:06.150 --> 39:08.310
Why are you always angry, Mr. Min?

39:09.940 --> 39:11.150
Since when was I angry?

39:21.530 --> 39:22.740
Hey...

39:23.460 --> 39:24.910
are you hungry?

39:26.330 --> 39:28.170
Yes.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.100
Why aren't you eating?

39:43.560 --> 39:46.900
- Can't you use chopsticks?
- I don't know how.

39:55.650 --> 39:56.950
Use this instead.

40:17.840 --> 40:18.840
Good?

40:38.780 --> 40:40.160
You've already had three!

40:53.880 --> 40:55.670
I don't know what the hell I'm doing...

40:56.880 --> 40:59.220
This is why you should
watch what your kids eat.

41:00.800 --> 41:03.300
What do they feed him, anyway?

41:03.300 --> 41:05.560
I get a special supplement.

41:05.560 --> 41:09.520
Shame on them for
treating a kid like that.

41:14.610 --> 41:17.690
Not yet. Give it a couple of minutes.

41:31.710 --> 41:33.210
How did you know?

41:34.540 --> 41:35.840
Know what?

41:35.840 --> 41:38.340
That you're a specimen.

41:38.340 --> 41:40.090
Mom told me.

41:40.090 --> 41:42.550
You have a mom?

41:42.550 --> 41:45.890
You met her.

41:48.890 --> 41:52.270
Ah... Dr. Lim is your mom?

41:53.610 --> 41:55.190
So you have a mom.

41:55.190 --> 41:58.940
What? You don't have one?

42:01.530 --> 42:02.530
No.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.370
That's too bad.

42:12.790 --> 42:14.710
You've lived there your whole life?

42:16.050 --> 42:17.050
Yes.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.880
What do you do all day?

42:21.510 --> 42:23.470
I get tested.

42:24.050 --> 42:25.430
Eat.

42:28.140 --> 42:29.310
Read.

42:30.980 --> 42:31.980
That's it?

42:33.190 --> 42:37.070
You get tested and eat?
That's your whole life?

42:44.240 --> 42:47.320
It's okay, you're doing great.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.080
What else, then?

42:54.920 --> 42:57.420
Go on, eat. Your
noodles will get soggy.

43:02.840 --> 43:06.590
But you must be doing
something in your free time

43:06.600 --> 43:09.760
besides just sitting around.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.430
- I keep on thinking.
- About what?

43:14.690 --> 43:16.190
About my fate.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.790
Mr. Min, we're from the company.

43:40.790 --> 43:41.930
Punch in the code.

43:52.680 --> 43:53.890
Identify yourself.

43:53.890 --> 43:57.980
Yum Kyung-jae from Domestic Team Three.

44:01.820 --> 44:03.440
Are we leaving now?

44:03.440 --> 44:05.110
Yes, please get ready.

44:12.110 --> 44:14.110
Is that the specimen?

44:17.750 --> 44:18.830
Hey, hey!

44:21.000 --> 44:21.630
What's this?

44:21.630 --> 44:23.300
We have orders to take him out.

44:23.300 --> 44:26.050
- Who told you that?
- I can't say.

44:26.050 --> 44:28.300
I can clear everything
up, just put the gun down.

44:28.300 --> 44:29.300
Step aside.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.680
I said put the gun down!

44:32.600 --> 44:34.720
If you won't step aside,
we have no choice.

44:35.680 --> 44:41.190
Go on then. Shoot me.

45:55.260 --> 45:56.600
Is it done?

45:56.850 --> 45:57.930
This is Min.

45:59.180 --> 46:00.980
Explain yourself.

46:03.480 --> 46:04.600
<i>Ki-hun...</i>

46:04.610 --> 46:08.310
I'll tell you everything,
but right now, listen to me.

46:12.070 --> 46:13.950
Take out the specimen immediately.

46:15.620 --> 46:17.910
<i>Did you hear me? Kill it now.</i>

46:19.500 --> 46:21.160
<i>That's an order.</i>

46:25.670 --> 46:27.300
- What about me?
- What?

46:28.050 --> 46:29.340
Am I supposed to just die?

46:30.550 --> 46:33.260
Wake up, Min. This is for the country.

46:33.510 --> 46:36.220
How is this for the
country? It's just for you.

46:36.550 --> 46:38.850
<i>You think I'll fall
for that shit again?</i>

46:38.850 --> 46:40.470
Are you disobeying my order?

46:40.470 --> 46:42.390
Order, my ass.

46:42.390 --> 46:44.680
Do you want to die, you asshole?!

46:44.690 --> 46:48.560
No, dumbass. I want the exact opposite.

46:48.570 --> 46:49.690
Screw off.

46:57.410 --> 46:58.990
<i>Is Seobok okay?</i>

46:58.990 --> 47:00.490
Yes, he's fine.

47:00.490 --> 47:02.250
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

47:02.250 --> 47:04.510
You should bring him to the lab.

47:04.900 --> 47:07.620
You can't go to intelligence now.

47:08.610 --> 47:11.940
<i>We can offer you protection here.</i>

47:19.890 --> 47:22.180
- He's bringing him in.
- Good.

47:23.890 --> 47:26.360
We should get ready for our guests.

47:26.980 --> 47:28.730
Now, sir?

47:28.730 --> 47:30.730
Why? Is there a problem?

47:31.150 --> 47:32.950
Preparation will take time.

47:32.950 --> 47:34.070
You idiot...

47:34.740 --> 47:38.620
I didn't do all this so
someone could take it from me.

47:50.670 --> 47:52.090
Come on, get in.

47:53.510 --> 47:54.880
Where are we going now?

47:54.880 --> 47:58.170
To the lab. It's the
only place we can trust.

47:58.180 --> 48:00.890
No. I don't want to go there.

48:07.040 --> 48:08.210
Then where?

48:08.820 --> 48:10.200
I need to go somewhere.

48:11.860 --> 48:13.360
You have no place to go.

48:13.970 --> 48:15.220
Ulsan.

48:16.650 --> 48:17.650
Why?

48:20.070 --> 48:21.490
You don't have to know.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.870
You little shit... get in the car!

48:31.500 --> 48:33.340
You don't have to come with me.

48:34.840 --> 48:36.340
I can go on my own.

48:39.970 --> 48:42.510
And how will you do that?

48:46.680 --> 48:48.100
With this.

48:50.190 --> 48:51.810
Where did you get that?

48:51.810 --> 48:52.940
From the house.

48:52.940 --> 48:53.980
That's not yours.

48:53.980 --> 48:56.030
It's not yours either.

49:03.990 --> 49:08.790
I don't know what you're thinking,
but you can't keep running like this.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.170
There's no time.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.380
I know.

49:13.380 --> 49:17.470
And you need your
injection. We need to get back.

49:19.010 --> 49:20.050
I know.

49:20.050 --> 49:21.760
What do you know?

49:23.930 --> 49:25.390
I said I know...

49:31.640 --> 49:38.150
Tell me... what's in Ulsan?

49:38.150 --> 49:39.650
At least give me that.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.080
You really want to know?

49:44.080 --> 49:46.580
I want to know what we're going for.

49:49.370 --> 49:54.420
Do you... know someone there?

49:58.870 --> 49:59.870
Yes.

50:00.750 --> 50:01.920
Who?

50:07.020 --> 50:08.970
Who is it?

50:14.070 --> 50:17.160
No. It's better you don't know.

50:30.490 --> 50:33.200
Back at the safe house...

50:34.620 --> 50:39.550
bending bullets and
smashing things, did you do it?

50:41.550 --> 50:43.510
Yes. Why?

50:44.850 --> 50:48.270
Just curious.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.470
Why didn't you step aside?

50:52.490 --> 50:53.710
Huh?

50:53.730 --> 50:56.090
When they pulled their guns,

50:58.160 --> 51:00.080
why didn't you step aside?

51:04.570 --> 51:09.080
Because... if you die, I die.

51:12.920 --> 51:14.420
Of course.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.290
Why are you dying?

51:23.260 --> 51:25.050
It's a punishment.

51:42.820 --> 51:43.860
What's wrong?

51:43.860 --> 51:45.360
It's okay.

51:45.360 --> 51:47.740
- No, you're not!
- I'm fine.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.920
It's been a long time, Mr. Chairman.

52:01.670 --> 52:02.920
You've been well?

52:02.920 --> 52:04.460
<i>Why are you trying to kill it?</i>

52:04.470 --> 52:05.420
Sorry?

52:05.420 --> 52:07.340
<i>The specimen. Why
are you trying to kill it?</i>

52:07.340 --> 52:09.140
What are you talking about, sir?

52:09.140 --> 52:11.270
<i>You met with the
Americans, didn't you?</i>

52:11.930 --> 52:15.180
<i>Come clean. Only then can we talk.</i>

52:16.850 --> 52:18.900
<i>What did they want?</i>

54:25.610 --> 54:30.610
So you know, I can't say
for sure you're not on that list.

54:35.570 --> 54:40.370
<i>You planned to give it to the
Americans from the beginning.</i>

54:40.370 --> 54:41.540
<i>You lied to me.</i>

54:41.540 --> 54:44.040
That's the only way
to end this quietly.

54:44.040 --> 54:48.040
<i>And you actually trust them?</i>

54:48.050 --> 54:50.250
<i>They want it because
they want it for themselves.</i>

54:50.260 --> 54:53.630
Sir, one thing I know for sure is that,

54:53.630 --> 54:56.640
if this experiment is revealed,
none of us will make it out.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.520
<i>You little useless coward.</i>

55:00.520 --> 55:04.060
If we destroy the specimen,
everyone goes home happy.

55:04.060 --> 55:05.270
<i>Not happening.</i>

55:06.650 --> 55:08.770
<i>You think your
dirty look will kill me?</i>

55:08.770 --> 55:11.570
<i>You think I'll sit back
and watch you fool me?</i>

55:13.450 --> 55:15.740
What are you going to do, then?

55:17.700 --> 55:22.250
You've got the money but that's it.

55:23.200 --> 55:24.710
Kim...

55:25.750 --> 55:30.260
do as I say if you still want
that sad old life of yours.

55:32.050 --> 55:36.350
You're just a businessman,
stay in your lane!

55:40.010 --> 55:41.590
<i>You stupid fool.</i>

56:07.290 --> 56:08.710
- How much?
- A full tank.

56:08.710 --> 56:09.800
Yes, sir.

56:10.460 --> 56:12.250
Give me some money.

56:12.250 --> 56:14.380
- Why?
- We're out of gas.

56:16.130 --> 56:17.340
Pay the guy when he's done.

56:18.390 --> 56:20.640
- Can I use your restroom?
- It's in the back.

56:30.150 --> 56:31.780
Can I use your phone?

56:32.270 --> 56:34.030
You still don't have their location?

56:34.130 --> 56:37.040
The search area is too big.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.240
This country has all the
CCTVs in the known world.

56:44.060 --> 56:45.810
Scan every one of them

56:47.250 --> 56:48.670
and find them no matter what!

56:57.730 --> 57:00.310
Do you... want a receipt?

57:08.910 --> 57:10.620
<i>It's me.</i>

57:10.860 --> 57:12.600
Where are you?

57:12.610 --> 57:14.530
<i>We're on our way</i>

57:14.530 --> 57:18.350
but Seobok vomited blood. Is that okay?

57:18.660 --> 57:21.040
He's been off his
inhibitor for two days.

57:21.410 --> 57:23.330
<i>His brainwaves must be off the charts.</i>

57:24.790 --> 57:28.160
<i>You need to bring him in right now</i>

57:28.170 --> 57:29.710
or his life's at risk.

57:30.620 --> 57:32.590
I'll get there as soon as I can.

57:45.820 --> 57:47.350
Who's he?

57:47.640 --> 57:51.400
I don't know, but the
creep's been staring at us.

57:57.740 --> 58:01.070
Can't you talk? He must be a mute.

58:01.990 --> 58:04.070
He's stressing me out.

58:04.700 --> 58:05.910
Huh?

58:06.740 --> 58:08.080
Hey!

58:08.080 --> 58:09.410
I'm talking to you!

58:16.750 --> 58:18.610
What are you?

58:33.270 --> 58:37.270
<i>Sir, security footage
from Uiseong at 13:10.</i>

58:37.270 --> 58:39.400
<i>Put out a search warrant.</i>

58:39.400 --> 58:44.390
Min and the specimen are terror
suspects, shoot both on sight.

58:45.450 --> 58:49.370
But that'll put the
specimen at risk of exposure.

58:50.890 --> 58:52.960
Do you have a better idea?

58:56.230 --> 58:58.380
<i>I told you to stay put.
Why won't you listen to me?</i>

58:58.790 --> 59:00.630
You almost killed that kid!

59:00.630 --> 59:03.010
He hit me first.

59:03.010 --> 59:04.800
So what you did was right?!

59:05.640 --> 59:06.930
I can't believe this...

59:14.060 --> 59:16.270
If you're just going
to do as you please,

59:17.640 --> 59:19.140
then you're on your own.

59:29.810 --> 59:31.640
I'm sorry.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.950
Where are we?

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.900
We'll lay low here for a while.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:10.700
There will be checkpoints
all the way to the lab and...

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.710
The lab?

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:16.290
Hey.

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:20.750
Hey!

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.500
You need your injection, or
God knows what might happen!

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.550
Why are you so concerned?

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:28.470
What?

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.470
Ah...

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:33.140
So you can live.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.360
Yeah, sure, so I can live.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.860
I'm begging you, okay?

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.410
Why should I let you live?

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:51.950
All men die anyway.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.950
Why should you get to live?

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:00.090
Are you worthy of being saved?

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.070
You're right, every word you said.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.800
I'm not worth it.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.250
I deserve to die.

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:31.670
But I'm doing every
damn thing I can to live.

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:35.880
Is that so wrong? Tell me.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:37.840
Is it so wrong to want to live?

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:44.180
Why me? What did I do?
What else should I do?!

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:48.690
Tell me! What did I do so wrong?

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.770
Screw you. You don't know anything...

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:54.190
What do you know, you little shit?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.070
<i>Mom, what does forever mean?</i>

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.950
<i>It means there's no end.</i>

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:24.910
What's that like?

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:31.210
Imagine there's an apple.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.040
You cut it in half and eat it,

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:38.100
then you cut the other
half in half and eat it.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.850
<i>Then you eat half
of the remaining half.</i>

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:45.180
<i>Like the sun comes up in the
morning and goes down at night,</i>

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.770
<i>forever is like that.</i>

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.020
<i>Then...</i>

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.110
<i>what's it like to die?</i>

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:04.660
<i>It's like falling into a
very deep sleep forever.</i>

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.960
Open up.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.880
You have to eat all of it.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.420
Why?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.740
So you can be healthy.

01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:24.500
Why should I be healthy?

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.210
For me? Or for your experiment?

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:29.680
Stop it.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.730
But it's true. You made
me for the experiment.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:34.560
No, I didn't.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.720
Then why? Why did you make me, mom?

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.200
Because of Kyung-yoon?

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:02.010
I must have dozed off...

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:25.620
Did you put me there?

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:27.620
Yes.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.200
And you stayed here?

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:33.490
Yes.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:39.160
Why didn't you sleep?

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.090
I don't sleep.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:43.500
I don't know how to.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.550
You've never slept in your whole life?

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:52.430
No.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:01.610
Nothing surprises me anymore...

01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:08.330
I'm sorry.

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:13.460
It was wrong of meto lie to you.

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:16.080
I'm sorry.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.710
I thought you werereally going to die.

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:29.280
At this point, that would
hardly be a surprise.

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:32.720
What does it feel to be dying?

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.140
Not good.

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.320
It sucks, actually.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.990
Why?

01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:47.150
Because you're dying. Why else?

01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:50.240
Then did it feel good to live?

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:03.080
There were good times and bad times...

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:06.840
and definitely some shitty times.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:14.600
I'm confused now.

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:20.650
I can't tell if I want to live
or if I'm just scared to die.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.650
I don't know anymore.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.910
So I'm regretful.

01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:38.290
Of what?

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:46.000
Of how I've lived my life.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:57.220
I've been a coward.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.000
What do they say?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.250
To lay low for now.
They'll clean it up after a bit.

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:25.540
It's a goddamn mess
they can't clean up.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.090
I think the company ditched us.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.340
Aren't you mad at them?

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.050
Why should we take the fall?

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:42.430
It's all in here.

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:45.939
Take it to the press
or blow the whistle...

01:08:45.939 --> 01:08:48.979
but we have to reveal
ourselves if we want to live.

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:50.439
You know that.

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:07.750
So, what are you going to do?

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.560
This is not what we agreed on.
You said you only needed her phone.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.960
If this is to go away,
someone has to take the blame.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.250
You know how this works.

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:56.670
You bastard! How can you do this?

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.220
Watch who you're talking to.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.660
Would you like to take her place?

01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:10.230
If so, get in the car.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.580
I didn't think so. You coward.

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.530
- Let's go.
- Yes sir.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.760
<i>I stood there and watched.</i>

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.000
<i>I should've been in that car.</i>

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.260
<i>I ran...</i>

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.420
to save myself.

01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:31.080
I was scared.

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:35.320
I was scared, so I ran.

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:47.120
I'm sorry, Hyun-soo. I'm sorry.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.870
I'm so sorry.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.260
I'm sorry...

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.180
Take me to Imhyun church.

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:37.270
It's in Ulsan.

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:43.280
Please, Ki-hun.

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:04.690
<i>HOUSE OF BETHANY</i>

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.160
<i>HAN KYUNG-YOON 1996 – 2006</i>

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:55.120
That's me. Kyung-yoon.

01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:02.120
And my dad.

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:08.630
I wanted to come see it for myself

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.300
because it's the reason I was created.

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:17.540
After dad and I died in a car accident,

01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:20.820
mom got sad, so she made me.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.350
She shouldn't have done that.

01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:30.570
That doesn't make me Kyung-yoon.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:39.410
Do you think dying...
is really like sleeping?

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.000
Maybe.

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.460
Then how come people
aren't afraid of falling asleep?

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.170
It's like dying for a while.

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:56.260
Because they'll wake up the next day.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.470
How do they know that?

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:04.480
They just believe it.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:10.110
They believe they'll
wake up in the morning.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:21.120
It scares me to think of dying

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:30.840
but living forever is scary too.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:40.390
What should I believe to not be scared?

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:50.730
You can cry, if you feel sad.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.070
It's okay to cry.

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:09.770
It's beautiful.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560
What is?

01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:15.990
To be alive.

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:31.250
Where do we go now?

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:33.920
Well...

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.470
I don't know anymore.

01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:42.140
Let's go to the lab.

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:47.430
I have nowhere else to go.

01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:55.780
I was born there. My mom is there.

01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.610
That's my home.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.740
And that way,

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.120
you can live.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.460
I was born for that reason

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:25.220
and I will go to sleep for it too.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.650
What do you mean?
You said you never sleep.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.060
Sir, we heard back from Interpol.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.290
The men are from a
private military company.

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:10.180
Mercenaries?

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.850
Based in Southeast Asia, they
fought in the Filipino Civil War.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.440
VIP protection, assassination...

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.360
they're war thugs who
take any job for money.

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:32.660
What the hell?

01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:35.760
<i>Stop, pull over!</i>

01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:40.850
Request to run a plate. 36 No 5705.

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:42.340
We located Min.

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.510
The police are on him.

01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:44.510
Get it up on screen.

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.700
From the police black box camera, sir.

01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:57.860
<i>5705, 5705!</i>

01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.230
<i>Pull over!</i>

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:23.170
Shit!

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:49.530
Shoot! Kill them all!

01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:42.230
<i>How far will you take this?</i>

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.170
<i>As far as I can.</i>

01:23:45.170 --> 01:23:46.880
You leave us with no choice.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.090
Do as you will. We have guns too.

01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.590
You saw them earlier.
Ours are foreign made.

01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:54.130
I paid a lot of money for them.

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.470
I'm asking you out
of genuine curiosity.

01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:59.640
Are you senile?

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:03.020
<i>My mind is as clear as
crystal, you damn punk.</i>

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.110
<i>You thought I wouldn't
know? I knew all along.</i>

01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:10.360
<i>I knew from the beginning you
would hand it over to the Americans.</i>

01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:13.870
I knew Anderson was spying on us.

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:16.450
Is that why you killed him?

01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:20.040
And you pulled off a terrorist
attack using mercenaries?

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.790
Quite a job, Mr. Chairman.

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:28.210
I have a serious condition. Doctors
tell me I don't have much time.

01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:34.260
I'm sitting around waiting to
die. What could I be afraid of?

01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:56.700
<i>Mom...</i>

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:04.090
You became a doctor because
you wanted to become one.

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:09.090
What about me?

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.590
What can I become?

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:21.640
Can I...

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:29.780
want to become something too?

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:39.900
Can I?

01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:55.800
I'm sorry.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.010
I'm so sorry.

01:26:36.630 --> 01:26:38.470
You brought a whole army.

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:41.940
This is your last chance.
What are you going to do?

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.890
<i>This is what I'm going to do.</i>

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:48.230
<i>(BREAKING: Seoin Presents First Human
Clone) I'm sending it to the press later.</i>

01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:50.610
Who would believe this?

01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:52.900
They'll at least want to.

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:56.150
Who wouldn't want to believe
that you can overcome death?

01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:00.890
<i>You believed it. It's why
you brought an army.</i>

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:09.650
I'm not trying to save all of
humanity. Why would I do that?

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:14.340
I'll let some live and let some die.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:18.630
I get to make the call.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.530
Isn't this what you call God's power?

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.170
What's all this?

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.750
You're up. Why didn't you rest more?

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.960
We'll begin the
extraction process soon.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.160
All thanks to you.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.040
We'll collect Seobok's bone
marrow and extract the IPS cells.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.430
If we collect 40ml per day,
we'll have one liter in a month.

01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:10.810
Then your clinical trial...

01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:12.480
You'll do this for a month?

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.150
No, forever.

01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:19.360
Seobok doesn't die.

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:36.090
But isn't that cruel?

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.300
Cruel?

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.490
It's like collecting
insulin from a pig.

01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:51.440
Seobok isn't human. You know that.

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:58.020
Don't tell me you grew attached to him.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.010
<i>Where do we go now?</i>

01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:19.400
<i>Let's go to the lab. I
have nowhere else to go.</i>

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.230
<i>I was born there.</i>

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.180
<i>My mom is there.</i>

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.900
<i>That's my home.</i>

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.190
<i>And that way,</i>

01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:35.600
<i>you can live.</i>

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:43.070
<i>I was born for that reason</i>

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:49.960
<i>and I will go to sleep for it too.</i>

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.460
Wait.

01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:11.350
This isn't right.

01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:13.280
What do you mean?

01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:15.230
Just stop.

01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:16.520
What is this nonsense?

01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:22.760
Are you crazy?

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.690
Stop it right now.

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:28.470
If we stop, you'll die. You know that.

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.330
We're going.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:46.410
<i>Do what you will.</i>

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.180
Get out, all of you!

01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:12.790
What's going on?

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.460
How do you stop it?

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:22.130
Stop the machine. Stop it now!

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.530
That's enough.

01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:27.550
No one can stop this.

01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:30.970
Where's Dr. Lim?

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.480
Where is she?

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:01.230
What are you doing?

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:03.190
Calm down and lower the gun.

01:32:08.850 --> 01:32:11.100
<i>We preserved her body.</i>

01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:16.530
She's the only human
who has Seobok's DNA.

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:21.900
Shit...

01:32:23.190 --> 01:32:25.110
You're all insane.

01:32:41.210 --> 01:32:43.880
If scum like you live forever,

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.710
it will be a living hell.

01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:02.810
That's enough.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.770
We don't want to damage a test subject.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.970
You shouldn't have.

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.100
It wouldn't have ended this anyway.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:15.590
Please... don't...

01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:16.590
Help!

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.140
No! Don't kill him!

01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.260
No! Don't kill him!

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:01.880
Don't shoot! No!

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.270
Don't shoot!

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.940
Grab him, you morons!

01:35:31.810 --> 01:35:32.810
Go away.

01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:35.840
Don't come near me!

01:37:32.370 --> 01:37:33.830
Open fire.

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.500
I said open fire!

01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:49.080
Are you okay? You alright?

01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:51.600
Are you?

01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:57.180
We need to get in the car.

01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:15.270
Run.

01:40:15.490 --> 01:40:16.620
You have to run.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:19.200
To where?

01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:20.830
What?

01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:23.460
You know.

01:40:26.170 --> 01:40:27.840
I have nowhere to go.

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:36.730
Hey...

01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:41.350
Hey!

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:44.190
Hey!

01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:47.320
No, stop!

01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:58.520
Go up!

01:41:59.930 --> 01:42:01.640
Climb, you idiots!

01:42:21.670 --> 01:42:23.340
That's enough, it's over.

01:42:25.710 --> 01:42:27.130
What's over?

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.800
What are you doing?
You'll kill them all.

01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:40.970
What's wrong with that?

01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:42.980
All men die anyway.

01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:45.310
I said stop!

01:42:59.030 --> 01:43:00.490
Why did you do it?

01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:04.140
Why did you come back
when you knew everything?

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.930
I wanted to become something...

01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:19.510
something meaningful to someone.

01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:29.190
That was all.

01:43:36.150 --> 01:43:37.910
But this will never end.

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:47.120
It'll never end as long as I live.

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.380
It will only end when I'm gone.

01:43:59.250 --> 01:44:01.620
So end this for me.

01:44:18.570 --> 01:44:22.160
No... I can't.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.740
Please don't do this.

01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:33.250
Why not?

01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:38.810
Because you're scared you'll die too?

01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:45.430
But you know now.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.980
No matter how scared you
are, you can never run away.

01:44:55.690 --> 01:44:57.070
Am I wrong?

01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:49.080
You're right.

01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:54.790
I know now.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:45.880
Ki-hun...

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.480
I'm sleepy.
