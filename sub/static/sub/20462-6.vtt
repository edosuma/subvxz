00:13.722 --> 00:14.889
-[Shane] How's that?
-[Sophia] Yeah.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.641
-That's good. That's good.
-Oh, shit. Okay.

00:17.934 --> 00:18.935
[Shane grunts]

00:19.019 --> 00:19.853
Yeah.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.981
-Yeah.
-Yeah? How's that?

00:23.064 --> 00:24.190
-Good.
-Am I hurting you?

00:24.274 --> 00:25.734
-No. Everything's fine.
-Okay.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.152
Is this good for you?

00:27.235 --> 00:29.237
-Yeah, yeah. It's the best.
-Okay, good.

00:29.654 --> 00:33.700
Yeah. I'd have a better base
if we got rid of the money.

00:33.783 --> 00:34.659
No.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.203
No, no, no.
Now that I have disposable income,

00:37.287 --> 00:39.581
I wanna do it like they do in the movies.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.417
-We're doing that. Your bra is on.
-[laughs]

00:42.500 --> 00:44.878
We both know that money is teeming
with germs and--

00:44.961 --> 00:46.880
-Come on, stay positive.
-Yeah.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.507
Won't Lincoln watching you do it
make you last longer?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.968
I don't want this
to last any longer than it has to.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.512
-Okay. Let me just maybe--
-Yeah.

00:55.263 --> 00:56.890
-I don't know--
-Just a little bit.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.099
Okay.

00:58.516 --> 00:59.559
Thank you.

01:01.144 --> 01:01.978
Oh!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.646
Just shift my weight here.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.281

[laughs]

01:17.118 --> 01:20.246
-<i>Yeah, this is the Big Bopper speaking.</i>
-I put it on shuffle.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.831
Why is it even on there?

01:21.915 --> 01:24.167
'Cause it's a great song. Come on.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.627
I can't do it.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.796
My arms are too tired.

01:27.879 --> 01:28.880
[chuckles]

01:30.715 --> 01:33.009
-Although they do look bigger now.
-Nice.

-What's wrong?
-Well, I listed a bunch

01:57.242 --> 01:59.953
of these Gunne Sax dresses,
and no one's bid yet.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.705
Is that because
they're kind of honky-tonk?

02:02.789 --> 02:05.166
No, no. The country look is hot right now.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.753
Cowgirl tops,
and peasant shirts, long skirts...

02:09.337 --> 02:11.339
The Gunne Sax is
what we're evolving toward,

02:11.422 --> 02:12.799
and I'm gonna be there first.

02:12.882 --> 02:13.842
I bet you will.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.802
Steve Jobs didn't earn his turtleneck

02:15.885 --> 02:18.596
by just waiting for the next big thing
to come to him.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.099
These girls are gonna claw
each other's eyeballs out,

02:21.182 --> 02:23.768
just to get in on the ground floor
of a new trend.

02:23.893 --> 02:24.894
Sophia.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.313
-Mm-hmm?
-I'm going on tour for several months.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.734
You're right.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.194
I get it.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.362
I'm obsessing.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.574
But, hey, I promise you,

02:37.824 --> 02:41.786
as soon as I get my insurance card
and get my hernia fixed,

02:41.870 --> 02:44.372
I'm flying out to see you,
and then watch out.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.791
I'm gonna show you
what I'm really like in the bed.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.835
And that's five minutes on top,
missionary,

02:48.918 --> 02:50.211
-and then you're done?
-Uh-huh.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.046
Yeah, Sophia's so crazy.

02:52.130 --> 02:52.964
No doggy style.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.008
Ew! No, that's sexist.

02:55.091 --> 02:57.385
-Why?
-'Cause you're calling me a dog.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.220
I'd be a dog in that scenario, too.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.264
I wouldn't be,
like, a human fucking a dog.

03:01.347 --> 03:05.476
This can't be the last conversation
that I have with my girlfriend.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.442
Hey, do you like reggae music?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.944
Was that you trying to change the subject?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.488
If that was,
that was the most pathetic attempt ever.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.949
But do you like reggae?

03:20.033 --> 03:23.578
Like on a hot summer day,
or maybe on a booze cruise?

03:23.661 --> 03:25.663
I get it. It slipped out.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.583
But calling you my girlfriend
helps me set boundaries.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.294
It will help me not cheat on tour.
Trust me.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.796
I like to keep it cas, remember?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.173
Cas, totally cas.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.508
So cas
that I'm not even finishing the word.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.386
'Cause finishing words is
for uptight guys in suits, and I--

03:40.470 --> 03:41.763
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.807
-It's just cas for me.
-That was to get you to stop talking.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.977
Oh, well, you failed,
'cause I can talk right through a kiss.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.522
I'm very talkative. You're gonna have to--
No. You think that'll work?

03:51.606 --> 03:53.358
You can't force me to do anything.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.069
See? I can still keep talking,
no matter how many times--

04:13.920 --> 04:14.921
[yells]

04:15.964 --> 04:16.965
Yes.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.299
[sighs]

04:19.092 --> 04:21.469
Oh, hey, Lionel, I'm insured.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.887
[Lionel] Congrats.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.764
Now you can get those teeth fixed.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.975
Bye.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.071
Hey, kid.
Come here for a second, would you?

04:42.615 --> 04:43.950
Yes, Mr. Security?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.369
See that unattended bag over there?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.246
-The one in the corner?
-[Nathan] Yes, I do.

04:48.329 --> 04:52.792
What vibe are you getting off of that?
Art exhibit or Homeland Security threat?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.461
Sir, these are strange days
we are living in.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.547
You cannot be too careful.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.799
I think it is your patriotic duty
to report that.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.010
Fucking A, right, I'm a patriot.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.678
I got big news.

05:03.761 --> 05:04.846
Oh, let me guess.

05:05.054 --> 05:08.558
You started watching <i>Wife Swap,</i>
so, now we can talk about it all the time.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.644
That's never gonna happen.
This is what's up.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.064
And, Rick, now that I'm insured,
I'm out-skis.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.733
You're quitting just like that?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.985
Well, I'm not gonna leave you
all high and dry,

05:19.068 --> 05:22.030
like a total douche, B.
I'll stay to the end of the week.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.198
But that's tomorrow.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.201
Yeah, it is. And then my life begins.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.245
Wait. But what about your hernia?

05:29.829 --> 05:32.165
Yes, well,
my insurance lasts for three months.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.208
So, I got time to fix that nonsense.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.503
What I don't have time for
is letting my soul die

05:37.587 --> 05:39.505
in the most boring job known to man.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.550
Clearly you've never worked
at the Crater Lake Visitor Center.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.636
Listen, every second I spend
in this brainwash factory

05:45.720 --> 05:48.973
not working on Nasty Gal
is one more second of my life wasted.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.393
I need to be out there,
following my passion.

05:52.810 --> 05:53.978
And never looking back.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.064
[Nathan] Oh, my God. She's right.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.483
This whole time I've been hiding.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.569
-Denying my true self.
-Look, kid, if you're coming out,

06:01.652 --> 06:04.989
-I think I can save you some time.
-No, I've been out since I was three.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.742
I'm talking about myself as an artist.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.827
When Basquiat was my age,

06:09.911 --> 06:12.747
he was homeless and living in a box
and spray painting walls.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.583
He wasn't going to office hours,
so a teacher could tell him

06:15.666 --> 06:18.711
that he needs to make better use
of negative space.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.171
I've gotta get out of here.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.007
-And take the leap.
-Kind of stealing my thunder.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.717
Here is my ID.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.345
A symbolic gesture, since it is expired.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.387
Rough picture, kid.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.015
-Sophia.
-Yes?

06:31.099 --> 06:31.933
Thank you.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.644
And I still owe you lunch
from those three times.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.650
I'm a little worried about him,
but not enough to step in.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.574
[Sophia] Bid.

06:49.867 --> 06:50.827
Bid.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.580
I command you to bid.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.836
It's like, I'm not too worried.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.547
Bidding always picks up
right before the auction closes.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.298
But I just need that one girl,

07:04.382 --> 07:08.219
you know, get the ball rolling,
and then the feeding frenzy begins.

07:08.302 --> 07:12.557
Unless that one girl died of smallpox,
200 years ago.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.183
-Annie...
-[Annie laughs]

07:14.267 --> 07:16.144
those Gunnes are gonna be in style.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.645
-Do you wanna know why?
-Hmm.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.938
Because I'm never wrong.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.314
[Annie] Hmm.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.483
Except for when anyone asks me
to pick a hand.

07:22.567 --> 07:23.401
Do it.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.989
-No, you're wrong.
-What?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.407
-Look.
-Oh, God.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.324
Yeah.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.369
-You know, in business school, we--
-Yes, we know.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.789
We know. You went into huge debt,
just to become more boring.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.792
It's crippling debt.
And thanks for never leaving a tip.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.379
What they teach you is,
you can't tell the market what it wants.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.672
The market tells you.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.590
Uh, that's not true.

07:45.673 --> 07:49.802
I didn't know that I wanted chicken fries
until Burger King told me that I did.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.263
-Now I love them.
-Yeah. We read about Burger King.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.932
Chicken fries were a result
of a focus group study,

07:55.016 --> 07:58.060
and the results were clear,
Americans love fried cylinders.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.271
I love this country so fucking much.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.566
You know, your nerdy studies may work
for businesses,

08:03.649 --> 08:05.735
but what I have is not a business.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.111
It's bigger than that.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.905
-It's my personal passion.
-[Dax] All right.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.575
But it may behoove you
to listen to a learned source.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.162
Dax, what did I tell you
about using the word "behoove"?

08:16.245 --> 08:17.747
You said it wouldn't behoove me.

08:18.539 --> 08:23.294
The point is, is that history is littered
with cases of shortsighted companies

08:23.377 --> 08:25.546
who didn't recognize
what the customers wanted,

08:25.630 --> 08:28.257
and ended up going belly up.
Gadzooks, Polaroid, Schwinn.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.843
Well, those companies failed
because they sound stupid.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.222
Most companies fail.
Ninety-five percent of them fail

08:34.305 --> 08:35.306
in the first five years.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.808
Hey, I like those odds.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.520
'Cause I know I'll be in the five percent
that made it.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.647
Okay, Sophia. You got it.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.984
But if you find yourself playing
a prediction game, you better be right.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.238
Otherwise your "non-business,"
or personal passion,

08:50.321 --> 08:52.323
whatever you wanna call it,
it's going down.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.293
Is it that hard for there
to be toilet paper in the bathroom?

09:47.211 --> 09:50.214
They save the toilet paper
for the ones with talent.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.382
[chuckles]

09:51.465 --> 09:53.718
I am really gonna miss the way you yell.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.469
Aw.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.762
Whoa, who's that for?

09:56.846 --> 10:00.016
Well, uh, it's your last day, so,
I thought we'd have a little celebration,

10:00.099 --> 10:01.726
'cause, well, the truth of it is...

10:02.476 --> 10:04.437
you're the best employee
I've ever trained.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.189
[laughs] Rick, that is so nice.

10:07.732 --> 10:08.816
And crazy if true.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.860
Well, anyways, enjoy your, uh, cupcake.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.946
You know, the fun thing about this
is you can pretend it's a regular cake

10:14.030 --> 10:16.032
-and that you're a giant.
-[Sophia] Oh, cool.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.826
Look, there's something
I've been wanting to say to you--

10:18.909 --> 10:20.911
-Well, um--
-But I'm not much of a word talker,

10:20.995 --> 10:22.788
-Actually--
-so, pardon the envelope.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.542
I used one of the free ones
they give you with your electric bill.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.794
-You know, to save trees.
-Um...

10:28.878 --> 10:31.631
I'm actually not leaving.
I've been thinking about it and...

10:32.173 --> 10:33.215
I decided not to quit.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.843
-I'm gonna take this back.
-Okay.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.929
Trust me on it, it'll be better
for both of us. [clears throat] Mostly me.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.766
So, uh, why the sudden change of heart?

10:41.849 --> 10:44.644
Yesterday you said
some pretty hurtful things

10:44.727 --> 10:46.562
about this suckhole of a job.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.732
Well, I just think the smarter play...

10:49.815 --> 10:51.984
...is not to make any big moves right now.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.237
I thought you said,
as soon as you got your insurance card,

11:00.701 --> 11:03.913
Have you seen the statistics
for people getting hernia surgery?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.873
No, girl. If it's not in <i>Us Weekly...</i>

11:05.956 --> 11:08.959
They are terrifying.
Five percent of people die from it.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.753
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.799
I do not like those odds. I know I'll be
in the five percent that doesn't make it.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.717
Wait, so, why stay at the art school?

11:16.801 --> 11:20.888
Well, sometimes being the boss of yourself
means working for other people.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.115
It means not drinking

11:42.576 --> 11:45.413

-Mm-hmm.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.790
-You know what?
-Hmm?

11:47.873 --> 11:48.958
I just decided.

They went off and did their thing,
and you just...

picked up this red string you found,
and started...

19:56.278 --> 19:58.864
running around, dragging it behind you.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.453

You told them the string
was attached to a kite.

to try out that damn kite.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.155

I remember thinking...

my Sophia...

20:49.539 --> 20:51.416
is going to be capable of anything.

Somewhere along the line, you...

gave up on yourself.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.868
Maybe I did, too.

You're awake.

So glad you're here.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.526
I came as soon as I could.
And your dad was here, too,

21:59.609 --> 22:00.777
but he had to go to work.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.406
And that guy just gets hotter as he ages.

And let me tell you,
I charmed the hell out of him.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.078
He was all like, "Take care of Sophia."
And I was all like,

22:10.162 --> 22:11.663
"Oh, well, well, well."

22:11.747 --> 22:14.249
He was like, "Hey, please,
try to sell her on college.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.627

And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

22:17.961 --> 22:19.171
Okay, I give up.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.548

22:22.257 --> 22:23.091

22:23.592 --> 22:25.594
No. Now the appeal's gone.

Where you going?
You're on bed rest, you lucky turd.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.684
Annie, I had a brush with death.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.561
I saw the other side.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.146
It taught me one thing.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.899
I need to quit that art school job,

22:39.691 --> 22:41.276
because I have a business to run.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.153
Amen, sister.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.822
No matter how many Gunne Sax
I do not sell,

22:45.906 --> 22:47.032
I'm never gonna give up.

-Preach.
-Take a memo.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.368
I don't have a pen.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.705
Right. Just remind me to call Shane
and tell him that I'm alive,

22:53.955 --> 22:56.458
and I'm not gonna be able
to meet up with them on tour,

22:56.541 --> 23:00.253
-because I am too busy to get busy.
-TBTGB.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.883
-Okay. Can we just do this later?
-Yeah.

23:04.966 --> 23:08.470
In my head, this looked way more gangster,
and I'm hurting real bad.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.305
-[chuckles] Okay, one question.
-Mm-hmm?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.848
Which hand's the Vicodin in?

23:12.933 --> 23:13.767
That one.

23:14.935 --> 23:15.977
It was in both.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.189
-Wha--? Oh, you're the best.
-You win.

23:20.023 --> 23:24.069
Sophia, I was worried about you.
Hey, did they let you keep it?

23:24.152 --> 23:25.153
-The hernia?
-[Rick] Yeah.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.531
No, it doesn't really work that way
I don't think.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.533
Right, right, right. Just checking.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.785
Because if they had let you keep it,

23:31.868 --> 23:35.247
then I would have made
a very stern phone call on your behalf.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.959
-We need to talk.
-Listen, I know what this is about.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.085
You know...

23:40.168 --> 23:41.253
I was silly to think

23:41.336 --> 23:45.173
that keeping that note from you
would kill the electricity that we have.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.552
If it can survive
the socially unacceptable age difference,

23:48.635 --> 23:49.594
-then--
-Yeah.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.805
Yeah, it can survive anything.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.515
And I've always said,

23:53.598 --> 23:56.768
half your age plus seven is more
of a guideline--

23:56.852 --> 23:57.811
I have to quit.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.023
-For real this time.
-Just reaching here. Uh...

24:02.107 --> 24:04.818
Is this because you have a rule
against dating coworkers?

24:05.402 --> 24:07.487
-No. No, no. That's not it.
-[Rick] No.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.489
-Sorry.
-[Rick] Well...

24:09.990 --> 24:13.577
All right, well, this conversation's
going swimmingly for old Rick.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.453
[laughs] Oh...

24:15.537 --> 24:16.997
[chuckles]

24:17.581 --> 24:18.415
But hey.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.335
Got something for you.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.880
