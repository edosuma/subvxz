WEBVTT

05:36.570 --> 05:39.438
Right it's feeding time!

05:40.808 --> 05:42.441
Right, come on, don't be shy.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.945
Come on, hustle hustle, there's
starving kids in Africa.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.680
Here you go, come and get it,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.949
the faster you eat the
faster we get to work.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.438
We got to get the runts out
more.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.441
The search needs to
extend past just the boy.

06:16.443 --> 06:19.511
I know, I've heard it before.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.547
I was reading that
they says here that there

06:22.549 --> 06:24.082
must be a fallin' of hope in

06:24.084 --> 06:25.984
order to find the justice in
things.

06:29.390 --> 06:33.492
You can't have a hero
that's lost all his hope.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.626
It's about the testin'

06:34.628 --> 06:36.395
and then the rebuildin' phase.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.065
Bein' rebuilt, that's justice.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.002
I can't even read this.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.906
It'll probably be some TV drivel
soon.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.946
I can't take this.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.087
It's right where you put it.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.092
I'm tell you it wasn't there
before.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.562
That boy's got a mind of his
own.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.167
Okay, it's not me you're
fixin' on.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.670
Blamin' the boy like you'd allow
'em

07:18.672 --> 07:20.906
next to this science experiment.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.608
Best be weary of that temper of
yours

07:23.610 --> 07:25.043
it's gonna getcha in trouble.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.483
I know it's around the corner,

07:31.485 --> 07:34.453
but them plants are gonna
need taking care of.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.688
Yeah, I got the boys out there.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.857
Gotta clear out the dead roots
first.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.993
It'll be a good season, don't
you worry.

07:45.766 --> 07:50.836
I just don't get why we're
not flyin' yet, ya know?

07:51.805 --> 07:56.875
There's islands out there
and plants and, animals.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.077
We could cash in the crop

07:59.079 --> 08:00.879
and we can take the boys with
us.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.814
You can write your own books,

08:02.816 --> 08:07.052
it'll just be peaceful all
around us.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.857
You know the walk between

08:11.859 --> 08:14.159
justice and family is a thin
line.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.028
We're doing a good thing.

08:17.865 --> 08:21.199
So for us we got to keep
our heads in the game.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.011
Well, did you win?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.717
Ah, Fliny always says don't be
afraid

08:38.719 --> 08:41.686
to use yourself if you
ain't got the means.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.155
I guess you did just
that, so take care of it.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.664
I know you found us
some good out there boy.

08:54.935 --> 08:56.568
How many miles?

09:01.074 --> 09:03.041
No matter, it's our night now.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.944
City targets is our territory.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.714
That's a hell of a shot boy.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.195
Pack up.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.816
I have a felling something drew
us here.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.891
Give it more punch, try it
again.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.198
Hey man, need some help?

10:01.234 --> 10:03.335
We can't figure this engine.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.637
Do you know the F series?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.839
I've worked on a few but this
looks

10:07.841 --> 10:09.774
like a '70 and they're kind of
rare.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.780
She's a hand-me-down from my
uncle.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.820
He never mentioned all the
problems.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.390
Ain't that how it always goes.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.292
The gift that keeps on giving.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.159
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.628
I guess the real gift is.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.213
Is not human.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.421
Built from the ground up like a
god.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.933
This one here hid behind his
identity.

11:41.935 --> 11:42.967
Behind his money.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.773
Only traveled by night.

11:53.180 --> 11:57.148
Flew through the darkness
to save an entire city.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.958
It didn't work though.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.463
It never does.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.433
You are weak.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.910
You didn't even make it
through the first round.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.813
We're gonna play a little game,

12:28.815 --> 12:32.383
you're gonna pretend that
your life isn't already over.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.354
You know we're not out
looking for trouble,

12:36.356 --> 12:38.890
we just know that unless
you can be rebuilt

12:40.127 --> 12:41.392
you are not a hero.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.030
It's not our call who the heroes
are,

12:46.032 --> 12:47.465
its whoever can last.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.971
And you definitely did not.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.513
I feel like I'm talking to
myself.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.297
One day you'll be in charge
here.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.500
Fliny and I will be on the road
somewhere.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.970
The markers are getting better.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.174
You're learning, every
time you're learning.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.049
You're looking out for your old
man.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.554
There you go.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.522
Kick it, go ahead.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.890
That's right.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.058
Put it out!

13:47.060 --> 13:49.561
There you go, that's my boy!

13:49.563 --> 13:50.862
Yeah!

13:50.864 --> 13:51.830
Kick it!

13:51.832 --> 13:53.032
Let's go, kick it, put it out!

13:53.466 --> 13:55.300
Put it out!

13:55.301 --> 13:57.135
There you go, kick it, go ahead!

15:10.677 --> 15:13.478
Marking your territory like a
stray huh?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.914
Whoa, afraid of strangers kid?

15:17.617 --> 15:19.267
I don't blame you,

15:19.268 --> 15:21.148
probably don't want to
get another one of those.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.657
It's pretty impressive.

15:27.627 --> 15:31.696
Listen if you're gonna do
this got to have a flow to it.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.665
It's like music.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.367
You ever listen to music?

15:38.638 --> 15:39.570
No?

15:39.572 --> 15:43.574
It's alright, it all
sounds the same anyway.

15:46.046 --> 15:50.348
Look, you just got to be
careful out here doing this.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.583
Alright, you got to keep your
hands clean

15:52.585 --> 15:55.186
cause you don't want people
catching on.

15:55.188 --> 15:59.357
So, look you're already
destroying the wall

15:59.359 --> 16:01.125
you might as well not
get your hands dirty.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.695
You got to be smart about it.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.105
Guessing breakfast was
a couple days ago huh?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.014
God, slow down I got more.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.016
Hey.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.624
Did your parents give you a
name?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.762
I'm guessing they don't exist do
they?

16:38.565 --> 16:40.231
But you got owners though right?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.701
Everybody's got someone who owns
them.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.738
Where your keepers at?

16:49.542 --> 16:50.642
See the problem is if you're a
runaway

16:50.643 --> 16:51.743
I'm gonna have to take you home
because

16:51.745 --> 16:53.745
those keepers are gonna want you
back.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.081
Hey, what's your name kid?

16:58.351 --> 17:00.385
They call me boy.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.589
Adam.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.528
Boy Adam, that's your name?

17:13.465 --> 17:16.067
It's what the owners call you
isn't it?

17:16.069 --> 17:17.468
I have to go home now.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.636
What you go a curfew?

17:20.573 --> 17:21.705
When it's nighttime.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.168
This place looks pretty empty,

17:34.169 --> 17:35.849
you sure those keepers
got a place for you?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.291
Hmm?

17:42.095 --> 17:44.062
Out here with the wolves huh.

17:46.132 --> 17:48.499
Hey, that big farm right there,
that you?

17:51.771 --> 17:52.703
Alright.

17:52.705 --> 17:58.076
Well we stay out here
much longer we're gonna be

17:58.078 --> 18:03.147
predators meat so you best
get yourself back inside now.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.355
Come on, bring 'em over,
bring 'em over, bring 'em over.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.157
Come on, come on, come on.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.127
Colin, you got to crack the
crust.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.261
There you go.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.431
Oh damn.

18:20.433 --> 18:24.402
Y'all need to get bigger ones
than this, you're looking sad.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.374
This is it.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.810
There ain't no escaping what's
coming.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.481
We got a new spot, I'm branching
out into the waste lines.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.749
We've seen here,

18:41.287 --> 18:44.188
I want you to find me something
there.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.257
And maybe we'll find a good
house guest.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.166
Questions just kept coming.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.835
And there I was.

18:57.837 --> 19:00.738
In the shadows, searching.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.642
And this was everyday.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.743
No answers.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.448
Again, and again, and again.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.253
Until one day I asked
myself the right question,

19:16.523 --> 19:19.790
is it really about what's to
learn?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.227
I mean there's hints sometimes.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.531
You ask yourself questions like,

19:26.533 --> 19:29.634
"How is it possible for
them to do this to me?"

19:30.870 --> 19:33.171
Or better yet,

19:33.172 --> 19:35.473
"Is the common denominator
me all these times?"

19:38.344 --> 19:41.512
Really what you should
be saying is it's not for

19:41.514 --> 19:46.584
me to understand, but
it is for me to accept.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.892
I don't know.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.195
Maybe it's not their fault.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.666
But I'll tell you one thing,
it's sure as hell not mine.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.267
And it's not yours either.

20:04.637 --> 20:08.539
If you continue to search,
you will continue to fail.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.511
Right, I'm gonna get off my soap
box.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.513
Whose ready?

20:21.688 --> 20:22.720
My name's Holton.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.754
What's up Holton?

20:27.227 --> 20:29.561
Wasn't alcohol for me,

20:29.562 --> 20:31.896
it was the people that
used it that made me toxic.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.369
I've always found myself
gravitating toward problems.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.673
I think deep down inside,
whether I like it or not,

20:42.675 --> 20:45.276
its what I'm always chasing.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.546
Chaos.

20:51.417 --> 20:55.386
I know like you said it's
not on me to understand,

20:55.388 --> 20:56.787
it's on me to accept.

21:00.493 --> 21:03.461
Al-Anon is for those of us who
are dealing

21:03.463 --> 21:06.464
with the people who have the
problems, and it's funny,

21:06.466 --> 21:09.667
I think sometimes it makes us
think that we don't have 'em.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.739
I've always been straight edge,

21:14.741 --> 21:16.007
I've never had a drop of
alcohol,

21:16.009 --> 21:18.376
not a cigarette, nothing.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.810
I've never even been curious.

21:21.347 --> 21:24.348
But if all you ever knew was
chaos

21:24.350 --> 21:25.950
would you ever be able to
change?

21:31.324 --> 21:35.026
I think the way I grew up

21:39.532 --> 21:42.300
and some of the things that I
saw,

21:46.639 --> 21:47.972
things that happened to me,

21:51.377 --> 21:56.447
made me want to go against that
grain and live a clean life.

21:56.616 --> 22:00.017
But it also left me toxic.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.690
So that's why I'm here,

22:05.692 --> 22:09.393
I want to be able to trust my
gut

22:12.932 --> 22:16.667
and live my truth and
let it guide me everyday.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.677
Hey man, that was good today.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.831
You're opening up.

22:29.832 --> 22:31.115
Yeah, I'm just trying not to run

22:31.117 --> 22:32.950
from the problem anymore you
know.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.754
I figured you'd crack me
eventually.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.392
Yeah, it takes some work

22:41.393 --> 22:42.926
but we all come uncorked at some
point.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.128
I'm with you there.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.099
Its good to see a new
face in group by the way.

22:48.101 --> 22:50.701
My name's Karlhin but you can
call me Kar.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.336
Yeah, I'm Holton,

22:52.337 --> 22:53.970
I've been coming here for a
couple weeks.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.475
Sorry, being too formal.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.028
Well I guess this is what the
party

23:01.029 --> 23:02.669
looks like when you grow up
straight edge.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.949
Yeah this is pretty much
what you would find there,

23:04.951 --> 23:08.419
coffee and some sugar,
some shots of cream.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.154
That's better than letting the
bottle

23:10.156 --> 23:12.823
make your choices for you though
isn't it?

23:12.825 --> 23:13.758
It's true.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.494
Al-Anon isn't about separation
though,

23:16.496 --> 23:18.863
it's about guidance
through accepting behavior.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.699
And that's a tough lesson to
learn.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.635
But I guess time has wised us up
huh.

23:24.637 --> 23:25.637
Yeah.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.406
Well just that when
you've had a breakthrough

23:28.408 --> 23:30.007
you're gonna want to keep it
consistent.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.609
Come back, don't abandon it.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.112
Well you're a real straight
shooter and I appreciate that.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.080
Hey.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.648
I'll see you next week.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.650
Sounds good man.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.081
It's a veggie patty.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.953
My brother'd skin me alive
if he heard me say that.

25:24.657 --> 25:28.225
Well, it helps clean the
poison out, clears my head.

25:30.196 --> 25:35.266
No meat, no alcohol, no friends,
no fun.

25:36.969 --> 25:37.969
Nothing.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.572
I'm a clean soul now.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.741
I can't have friends.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.577
That's what I was told.

25:49.849 --> 25:53.851
Listen, whoever owns you

25:55.121 --> 25:57.555
is creeping too deep inside.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.060
You're not letting the
man in here shine through.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.897
Hey look, I made something I'm
proud of,

26:06.899 --> 26:07.899
you ever do that?

26:09.635 --> 26:10.635
No.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.807
Look, this here's a list.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.610
It's a book but I make lists in
it,

26:19.612 --> 26:21.011
helps me figure things out.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.816
You see anything I put
in this book comes true.

26:27.587 --> 26:29.753
All you got to do is write it
down.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.722
That's how I make things I'm
proud of.

26:32.592 --> 26:33.691
Know how to do that?

26:35.361 --> 26:39.029
Well good, your owners are
doing better job than I thought.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.602
This book, it helps me to
create,

26:45.671 --> 26:49.273
it helps me to craft and
it's all kept in here,

26:49.275 --> 26:51.976
it doesn't go anywhere
else, it's for my eyes only.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.313
Any thought, any idea I ever
have,

26:57.750 --> 27:01.385
I let it rest in here cause
it helps to get it out.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.724
Cause when you write things
down it takes what's in here

27:06.726 --> 27:09.860
and makes it real, does that
make sense?

27:19.205 --> 27:22.773
The boys have taken to bed,
I suggest you do the same.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.147
The boy's heading back soon
and we got another visitor.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.054
Always bringing trash in here
like that.

27:43.929 --> 27:48.232
You've got to be my
favorite little hoarder.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.968
Watching you flirt is
like watching a car wreck.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.939
Well it's an early start
tomorrow

27:57.209 --> 27:59.910
and I ain't got much flirtin'
left.

28:21.834 --> 28:22.834
You drew these?

28:24.770 --> 28:26.170
Yeah.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.272
This wasn't exactly what I meant

28:28.274 --> 28:30.874
when I told you to write things
down.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.309
This is something else.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.913
What are these drawings of?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.117
Things I see.

28:48.828 --> 28:49.960
- Hey Kar?
- Yeah.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.895
You have a second to chat?

28:51.897 --> 28:53.163
Yeah, sure, shoot.

28:53.165 --> 28:59.236
I was just thinking,
this process we talk about,

29:00.039 --> 29:03.507
these proceedings, you
think it's possible to get

29:03.509 --> 29:05.810
someone out of it while they're
in it

29:05.811 --> 29:08.112
or would they have to grow up
with it

29:08.114 --> 29:10.347
and then recognizee the
patterns?

29:11.884 --> 29:14.351
Okay, you're either asking for
a friend

29:14.353 --> 29:16.220
or you're sharing outside of
group.

29:19.759 --> 29:20.491
It's a boy.

29:20.493 --> 29:23.293
He's a good kid but it seems
like there's

29:23.295 --> 29:25.896
some broken support beams at
home.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.032
Is his family not around?

29:29.034 --> 29:30.534
Well that's the thing,
he definitely has owners

29:30.536 --> 29:31.869
but seems like they're sort of

29:31.871 --> 29:34.138
leading him sideways a little
bit.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.006
So you think they're users.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.341
Either that or there's something

29:37.343 --> 29:38.942
that happened in the past.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.845
I mean there's a lack
of social cues in place.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.181
So you're his lookout.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.084
Something like that.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.786
It's always difficult
when children are involved,

29:48.788 --> 29:51.488
would there be an opportunity
to talk to the kid or?

29:51.490 --> 29:53.223
Would you think that
would be the best move?

29:53.225 --> 29:56.193
It depends, is it dangerous?

29:56.195 --> 29:57.394
I don't know that yet.

29:58.264 --> 29:59.264
I see.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.101
Well all I can tell yah is
guests are always welcome

30:04.103 --> 30:06.403
and the door is always open.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.872
Alright, thanks for your help
Kar.

30:08.874 --> 30:09.840
Appreciate it.

30:09.842 --> 30:10.842
Anytime Holton.

30:11.544 --> 30:12.544
Take care.

30:15.848 --> 30:16.980
It's easy, see.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.770
That's it.

30:22.771 --> 30:25.255
So one every two spaces over.

30:27.293 --> 30:30.027
You see germs are a boy's best
friend,

30:30.029 --> 30:32.362
but dirt's my biggest enemy.

30:32.364 --> 30:35.399
This way them feet of yours
won't be tracking in dirt

30:35.401 --> 30:37.201
and seeds and all kinds of
grime.

30:38.404 --> 30:41.271
It'll finally be clean for
once when the season starts.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.950
Well come on boy, it
ain't gonna bite you.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.017
Go in and grab that.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.488
There you go.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.091
Take that mallet.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.126
I'm gonna give you a countdown.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.129
I want you to come down on it
hard,

31:07.199 --> 31:09.132
as hard as you can, you hear me
boy?

31:11.537 --> 31:12.537
Alright.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.106
Three.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.108
Two.

31:18.477 --> 31:19.477
One.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.346
Do it again.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.919
Again!

31:28.921 --> 31:30.520
Come on boy, hit it.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.557
Do it again.

31:33.559 --> 31:34.558
Go!

31:34.560 --> 31:35.525
Hit!

31:35.527 --> 31:36.493
Yeah, good boy!

31:36.495 --> 31:37.928
Hit it hard!

31:45.404 --> 31:47.237
Feels good doesn't it.

31:53.545 --> 31:54.545
Go get another one.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.318
He showed these to me.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.490
- Oh Jesus.
- What?

32:06.492 --> 32:08.125
You think it's serious.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.928
Yeah, this is abuse and neglect.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.231
How long did it take
him to show you these?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.233
Like a week.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.304
Where can I find them, the
family?

32:20.306 --> 32:22.439
Eagle Valley, they got a farm
out there.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.645
You gonna help me with
this big fancy dinner?

32:28.647 --> 32:30.681
Y'all earned this one.

32:30.683 --> 32:33.250
It's just for gathering during
the season,

32:33.252 --> 32:34.952
I'm gonna stuff you like kings.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.622
Go round up the boys, go on.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.481
Oh hello.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.550
I was wondering if I could have
a word

33:06.552 --> 33:07.684
with you for a minute?

33:10.756 --> 33:13.256
I run group out in Etna and

33:13.258 --> 33:15.258
I just came by to extend an
invitation.

33:17.730 --> 33:18.730
Speak.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.399
Okay, you'll have to excuse me,

33:22.401 --> 33:24.401
my name's Karlhin, you can call
me Kar.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.005
That's not a name, that's an
automobile.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.241
That's true.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.577
I guess my parents had a
strange sense of humor.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.413
You selling something?

33:37.282 --> 33:38.715
No, no no no.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.785
Your son, a friend of mine
received some drawings

33:41.787 --> 33:46.623
from him recently and
they're pretty explicit.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.459
Maybe I should just show 'em to
yah.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.430
Take a look at these.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.405
I'm sorry, I'm not
explaining myself very well.

34:01.407 --> 34:05.776
I'm a counselor and honestly
I really just came out here

34:05.778 --> 34:08.578
to tell you about the group
that I run and reach out.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.349
You know in situations like
these,

34:12.351 --> 34:14.251
not that there's any kind of
situation,

34:14.253 --> 34:17.120
I'm not assuming there's
any kind of situation

34:17.121 --> 34:20.056
but I felt it was best
after seeing these drawings

34:20.059 --> 34:24.527
to reach out and maybe even meet
your son.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.563
What seems to be the problem?

34:27.565 --> 34:29.800
Oh, no problem at all.

34:29.802 --> 34:32.469
I just happened to be in the
neighborhood,

34:32.471 --> 34:34.670
I'm spreading the word about
a meet and greet that I run

34:35.641 --> 34:37.107
that helps families in need.

34:37.109 --> 34:37.808
Oh.

34:37.810 --> 34:44.414
Excuse me, I don't think we've
been properly acquainted.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.150
I'm Artik.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.085
I'd shake your hand but I'm
covered

34:49.088 --> 34:50.786
in cooking oil and kid germs.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.822
Oh, no problem at all.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.291
I appreciate you sparing me.

34:54.293 --> 34:57.594
I'm sorry about Fliny,
she's a bit touchy

34:57.596 --> 35:00.130
around people she hasn't
dealt with before.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.748
I understand.

35:01.749 --> 35:03.365
These meetings are
about the neighborhood.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.702
No, is your son at home?

35:05.704 --> 35:08.538
Yeah, yeah, the whole family's
inside.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.807
Well a friend of your son's
brought

35:10.809 --> 35:12.609
something to the forum that I
run.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.177
A friend of his?

35:14.179 --> 35:15.545
Yeah.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.880
Huh, yeah.

35:16.882 --> 35:21.118
The boy is more of a
conversationalist than the other kids.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.154
I see.

35:24.723 --> 35:26.123
Well these drawings,

35:26.125 --> 35:30.560
I just figured I would pass them
onto you.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.598
Ah huh.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.701
He's being reading a lot of
comics.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.172
Oh I see.

35:42.341 --> 35:46.409
We're fixing to get supper but
these.

35:46.411 --> 35:49.613
Of course, I didn't mean to
impose,

35:49.615 --> 35:50.480
I was just in the neighborhood

35:50.482 --> 35:51.348
and I figured I'd stop by.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.883
No no, it's okay.

35:52.885 --> 35:54.718
No reason to be sorry.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.887
No no, thank you so
much for talking to me,

35:56.889 --> 35:58.589
I can come back

35:58.590 --> 36:00.290
and I'm really sorry for
the misunderstanding.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.726
If that's what works for you
okay.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.478
Have good night.

36:04.479 --> 36:06.229
Please apologize to your wife
for me.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.597
Fliny is a bit jumpy.

36:09.601 --> 36:10.667
Enjoy your dinner.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.583
Hey!

36:26.818 --> 36:28.585
Would you like to join us?

36:29.922 --> 36:31.788
We have enough fixings to go
around

36:32.925 --> 36:34.824
and you can come look in the
place.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.594
Might ease your mind.

36:38.764 --> 36:43.333
Oh um, yeah okay, sure.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.435
That'd be nice.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.204
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.707
Fliny likes to cook for a
small army.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.475
Oh, well I appreciate it.

36:52.477 --> 36:53.343
I appreciate it a lot.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.345
It's not everyday.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.868
Goddammit Artik!

37:18.870 --> 37:20.403
Not in here.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.639
We just laid out the dirt
floors,

37:22.641 --> 37:24.975
how we gonna get this clean?

37:28.280 --> 37:30.847
Come on, come on, get back.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.468
Hi Kar.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.885
There you are.

38:13.892 --> 38:18.361
Allow me to introduce
you to my magic workshop.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.531
This is where the research is
done.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.701
It's kind of like a melty barn.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.372
Please.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.775
Please.

38:31.777 --> 38:32.777
Please.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.715
Please.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.416
But I'm afraid because of the
situation.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.456
I'm going to have to get my
hands dirty.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.833
Whose this friend?

38:57.569 --> 38:59.602
The one who knows the boy?

39:01.707 --> 39:05.809
You may ask yourself, is
my mind back in control now?

39:05.811 --> 39:07.811
I think that's probably the
understanding

39:07.813 --> 39:09.512
of where we're all heading.

39:20.125 --> 39:23.593
I like to keep my surroundings
clean.

39:24.496 --> 39:25.496
Wait!

39:26.131 --> 39:27.131
Wait!

39:28.100 --> 39:29.632
Wait!

39:39.845 --> 39:41.778
What's your connection to the
boy?!

39:43.048 --> 39:44.514
No more chances.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.161
You're gonna have to forgive
me for what's coming.

39:59.131 --> 40:00.764
Wait, wait.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.589
Are you the new speaker?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.591
Hi, Sarah.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.692
Holton, it's a pleasure.

40:29.694 --> 40:31.728
Yeah, Kar's out all week.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.464
He didn't mention being out.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.800
Actually we were expecting him
but,

40:36.802 --> 40:38.302
do you need a meeting?

40:38.303 --> 40:39.803
I mean any of us are here,
any of us could do it.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.105
No, no thank you, I appreciate
that.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.318
Okay.

40:43.319 --> 40:44.530
I just needed to talk to him.

40:44.531 --> 40:45.742
Well we'll be here all week,

40:45.744 --> 40:47.010
so let me know if you need
anything.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.545
- Thanks.
- Okay.

46:10.802 --> 46:12.168
Oh shit.

46:18.510 --> 46:20.176
Hey, it's alright.

46:25.183 --> 46:26.183
Come on.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.485
Come on.

46:29.487 --> 46:30.487
Lets go.

47:07.592 --> 47:08.891
Right here.

47:14.098 --> 47:17.300
I take it you are a friend of
the boy.

47:27.879 --> 47:28.879
It figures.

47:31.082 --> 47:34.350
I don't what your connection is
to the boy

47:36.454 --> 47:40.289
but this land is mine and you
are marked

47:40.291 --> 47:43.559
the second you take a foot on
it.

47:59.410 --> 48:01.577
What are all those kids doing
out there?

48:03.248 --> 48:04.614
Why are they all locked up?

48:06.618 --> 48:11.888
Sometimes being locked
up sets a man free.

48:13.157 --> 48:14.157
Where's Kar?

48:18.596 --> 48:23.532
You're gonna tell me what
your connection is to the boy!

48:27.372 --> 48:31.407
Whatever it is you fear
most it's coming for you.

48:52.697 --> 48:56.632
I'm writing story about
finding something that's pure.

48:59.404 --> 49:01.470
The story isn't over.

49:04.042 --> 49:06.709
Purity exists in this world,

49:06.711 --> 49:10.012
the problem is the drivel,

49:10.014 --> 49:13.015
these heroes could not save us.

49:15.353 --> 49:18.220
That's not real life now.

49:18.222 --> 49:20.589
The story I'm writing, that's
real.

49:34.605 --> 49:37.106
I don't like that we're
having more visitors.

49:37.108 --> 49:38.975
He knows something about the
boy.

49:38.977 --> 49:41.410
Tough shit, we got to get rid
of him.

49:41.412 --> 49:44.046
Something about the
boy that we don't know.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.017
He can still make mistakes.

49:48.019 --> 49:50.653
Okay, I'll take care of the boys

49:50.655 --> 49:52.421
and we'll take care of the
harvest

49:52.423 --> 49:55.725
and you take out that trash
that's been stinking up my barn.

50:04.435 --> 50:06.786
I don't know what's coming to me

50:06.787 --> 50:09.138
but if it gives Adam a
better life than go ahead.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.341
I have to protect the boy,

50:12.343 --> 50:14.577
which is why I'm going
to give him your gun.

50:14.579 --> 50:16.746
It's something to remember you
by.

50:16.748 --> 50:19.281
Words and threats, it's all I
hear.

50:20.284 --> 50:22.585
Real torment comes from within,

50:22.587 --> 50:24.520
that's why these boys listen to
you.

50:25.690 --> 50:28.758
Cause deep down, you're
the one relying on them

50:30.161 --> 50:31.427
and they don't need you.

50:31.429 --> 50:33.513
Really?

50:33.514 --> 50:35.634
I'm telling you that you
chase purity and I live it.

50:37.668 --> 50:39.168
And if that's what you're after
why

50:39.169 --> 50:40.669
don't you come take mine away
from me?

50:42.040 --> 50:43.239
Huh?

50:43.241 --> 50:44.473
Come on!

50:53.518 --> 50:54.650
Let him free!

50:56.154 --> 50:58.054
Let him free!

51:07.131 --> 51:08.531
Why is he taking so long?

51:11.636 --> 51:15.304
We need to try something new.

51:15.306 --> 51:16.839
I need your help.

51:16.841 --> 51:17.841
Dammit.

51:19.343 --> 51:20.743
I need the alcohol.

51:27.218 --> 51:29.285
We were saving this for leaving.

51:36.194 --> 51:37.194
Go on, take it.

51:53.244 --> 51:55.778
The normal methods aren't
going to work.

51:57.548 --> 52:02.418
What does a man without
fear fear the most?

52:14.232 --> 52:17.266
So the boy says you don't even
drink,

52:18.736 --> 52:22.138
that's good because the more of
this

52:22.140 --> 52:26.208
poison that goes in yah,
the more you become the

52:26.210 --> 52:29.345
little blueprint you ran
away from your whole life.

52:34.685 --> 52:36.785
You're gonna have to open your
mouth boy.

52:48.866 --> 52:49.866
More.

52:51.335 --> 52:52.601
More!

52:52.603 --> 52:53.603
Come on!

52:56.407 --> 52:57.439
I want more!

52:58.376 --> 52:59.408
Come on, I'm ready.

53:01.245 --> 53:02.745
Bring me more.

53:10.655 --> 53:11.787
Get up boy!

53:13.724 --> 53:14.957
I got something for you.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.609
There, that's more comfortable.

53:55.666 --> 53:57.700
Oh, there you go.

53:59.337 --> 54:00.703
Not a bad view right boy.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.006
Ah you're thinking it again.

54:05.910 --> 54:08.811
The boy has his own free will.

54:11.983 --> 54:15.517
He's coming into his
manhood, ain't yah boy.

54:16.921 --> 54:19.688
I almost forgot, this isn't for
me.

54:20.791 --> 54:21.791
This is for you.

54:24.495 --> 54:26.862
I can't toast myself.

54:37.575 --> 54:38.575
This one's for me.

54:47.685 --> 54:50.386
And this one is for you boy.

54:53.057 --> 54:55.924
What the fuck are you doing?

54:55.926 --> 54:57.426
What the fuck are you doing?!

54:57.428 --> 54:59.395
Someone's got to teach the boy
how

55:00.331 --> 55:02.798
to toast before having a drink.

55:02.800 --> 55:03.800
Leave him be.

55:06.037 --> 55:07.603
I don't see no problem with

55:07.605 --> 55:09.405
sharing a good time with the
boy.

55:14.945 --> 55:18.814
No I definitely don't
see any trouble in that.

55:18.816 --> 55:19.816
Top it off for you.

55:23.387 --> 55:27.356
Now this is what adults
have on a good day.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.060
Stop it.

55:31.662 --> 55:33.395
One, you raise it up high.

55:35.733 --> 55:36.733
Yes.

55:38.502 --> 55:39.668
Raise it to him.

55:41.639 --> 55:42.905
And now you take a drink.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.477
Go on.

55:48.479 --> 55:49.479
Stop.

55:51.949 --> 55:52.948
Adam, don't drink that.

55:52.950 --> 55:54.583
He has his own free will.

56:06.764 --> 56:08.997
One more, now you got to
keep it in this time.

56:08.999 --> 56:10.299
Adam.

56:10.300 --> 56:11.600
Now its gonna have a
little bit of a kick to it

56:11.602 --> 56:13.669
but I ain't sent you wrong yet.

56:13.671 --> 56:16.472
Come on, I ain't even
putting up a fight.

56:16.474 --> 56:17.539
It ain't fighting,

56:17.541 --> 56:21.577
this is how your mom and dad
play after a long day at work.

56:22.780 --> 56:24.480
Someday if you want to grow up

56:24.482 --> 56:26.749
you're gonna have to take a sip.

56:26.751 --> 56:27.850
We ain't got all day.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.420
There you go.

56:31.422 --> 56:33.155
Again, drink it up.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.024
Give me that!

56:36.026 --> 56:36.925
Hey, hey!

56:36.927 --> 56:38.494
Adam, stop it!

56:38.496 --> 56:40.929
Goddammit, leave him alone!

56:40.931 --> 56:41.931
Stop it!

56:42.733 --> 56:43.866
You watch this!

56:43.868 --> 56:45.134
Drink it!

56:45.136 --> 56:47.469
Dammit leave him alone!

56:47.471 --> 56:48.871
Go!

56:55.880 --> 56:56.880
Hey, hey!

57:00.851 --> 57:03.018
I'm gonna make you feel what he
just felt.

57:14.632 --> 57:15.632
Boy.

57:18.602 --> 57:19.935
Go out and prep the tarp.

57:20.838 --> 57:25.874
Bring the CAT around,
get a shovel, dig a hole.

57:32.783 --> 57:37.820
Go out and dig a hole
boy or I'll make two.

57:43.127 --> 57:44.127
Now!

57:51.936 --> 57:52.936
Shit.

58:20.598 --> 58:22.831
I was thinking maybe
that friend of the boy's

58:22.833 --> 58:25.701
really is the one that
I've been searching for.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.136
A true hero.

58:29.273 --> 58:30.639
Pain don't bother him.

58:32.042 --> 58:36.078
He actually moves like he's
living in

58:36.080 --> 58:38.981
some state of constant
meditation.

58:44.755 --> 58:46.054
Then I had an epiphany,

58:49.093 --> 58:53.095
that when anger comes so does
the truth.

58:55.132 --> 58:59.968
That's when I realized
when something happens with

58:59.970 --> 59:01.236
the boy that upsets you,

59:05.209 --> 59:06.608
you're not pure inside.

59:30.634 --> 59:33.168
I left your friend out there.

59:36.040 --> 59:39.274
And soon you'll be able to join
him.

59:50.287 --> 59:51.987
Make it stop!

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.161
Get away from him!

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:52.981
Oh hey, hey.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:53.983
It's okay.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.219
It's okay sweetie.

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:04.026
Come on, give me the gun, hmm?

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:05.227
Come on.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:07.229
Come on sweetie, give me the
gun.

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:20.242
Give me the gun.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.379
Give me the gun!

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.262
Come on, we got to get to the
car.

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:05.600
Here, give me the gun.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:06.602
Go go!

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.016
Come on!

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:30.191
Get you!

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:23.713
Fliny!

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:29.385
Fliny!

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:34.690
Fliny!
