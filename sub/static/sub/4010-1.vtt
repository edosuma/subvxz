[ Narrator ]
There was a time...

00:34.292 --> 00:37.259
when the fierce and beautiful
land of Alagaesia...

00:37.360 --> 00:41.458
was ruled by men
astride mighty dragons.

00:43.535 --> 00:46.300
To protect and serve
was their mission...

00:46.406 --> 00:50.035
and for thousands of years,
the people prospered.

00:50.143 --> 00:52.476
But the riders grew arrogant...

00:52.579 --> 00:55.879
and began to fight
among themselves for power.

00:59.989 --> 01:01.956
Sensing their weakness...

a young rider named Galbatorix
betrayed them-

- [ Dragons Screeching ]
- and, in a single bloody battle...

- [ Warriors Yelling ]
- He crushed all rebellion...

01:29.957 --> 01:33.621
including the freedom fighters
known as the Varden.

Those that survived
fled to the mountains.

01:40.203 --> 01:42.967
There, they hoped for a miracle...

01:43.072 --> 01:46.099
that might even their odds
against the king.

01:54.253 --> 01:56.516
Our story begins one night...

01:56.621 --> 02:00.581
as Arya, an ally of the Varden...

carrying a stone...

02:04.030 --> 02:06.431
stolen from the king himself.

02:11.641 --> 02:14.735

07:00.817 --> 07:03.911
The king`s strip- best cut there is.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.820

melts into the meat.

- How much?
- [ Laughing ]

07:11.229 --> 07:13.528
How much?

Too much for a poor farm boy.

I have something-
something to trade.

- I found it.
- Stole it more likely.

07:32.054 --> 07:34.420

Where did a fool like you find such
an appetizing string of jewels?

- Interesting you should ask.
- Is that right?

08:11.236 --> 08:14.603
I was walking up the lane the other day,
admiring them sitting on a branch.

08:14.706 --> 08:16.765
Clap of thunder-
They fell off dead at me feet.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.934
So I thought,
``Well, I can`t leave `em there.
