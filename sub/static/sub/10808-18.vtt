Man lives in the sunlit world

to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.397
Ah, that sounds lovely.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.566
0h, dinner would be great.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
Yeah, she should be here

01:07.568 --> 01:09.303

Oh, you.

No, no, no, no,
everything's fine, yeah.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.711
Now, you sure you don't want
me to meet you, huh?

01:17.711 --> 01:18.946
You're going to come here?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.948
Well, I'm gonna see you

(dog barking)

01:25.252 --> 01:27.888
Honey, now, I told Jennifer

01:27.888 --> 01:30.891
you could stay up just as late
as you want to, huh?

01:30.891 --> 01:34.628
But try not to get overheated
this time, will ya, huh?

01:34.628 --> 01:37.264

0h, hi, Jenny. Come on in.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.808
Hi, Mrs. Warren.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.109
You are such a sweetheart

01:49.109 --> 01:51.512
to come over here
at the last minute like this.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.447
But... oh, with Harry away...

01:53.447 --> 01:55.983
It's okay.
I've got my homework.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.718
You look really pretty tonight.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.019
Where are you going?

01:59.019 --> 02:01.789
Oh, just a reception,
down at the high school.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.123
JENNIFER:
Uh-huh.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.559
Oh, I thought
that was on Thursday.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.528
-You going with Mrs. Townsend?
-(boy coughing)

02:07.528 --> 02:09.563
No, uh, Mr. Scott

02:09.563 --> 02:11.932
was kind enough
to offer me a ride.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.968
-Uh-huh.
-How's your dad?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.037
-Real good.
-(mechanical whirring)

02:17.037 --> 02:19.573
He always complains
when he's this busy, though.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.874
(mechanical whirring)

02:20.874 --> 02:23.377
| wish Harry had stayed
in the vacuum cleaner business

02:23.377 --> 02:25.946
instead of what it is
he's doing now.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.115
(whirring)

02:28.115 --> 02:31.018
Course, uh, I'm still
not sure what that is.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.853
(chuckles)
Well...

02:32.853 --> 02:34.655
-(c|attering)
-0h! I don't know why

02:34.655 --> 02:38.158
he can't invent a closet
with everything where I want it!

02:39.927 --> 02:41.929
BOY (calls):
Is that Jennifer?

02:41.929 --> 02:44.298
Yeah, it's me, Buddy--
I'll be right in.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.366
Oh, Jenny, ever since
Harry's been away,

02:46.366 --> 02:49.970
now Buddy has spent all his time
in his father's workshop.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.972
-Like father, like son.
-(|aughs)

02:51.972 --> 02:53.474
Where is it?

02:53.474 --> 02:55.809
-Oh. And, uh, Jenny?
-Mm-hmm?

02:55.809 --> 02:57.811
Buddy's having his
coughing spells again,

02:57.811 --> 03:00.147
-Okay. -but don't let it
scare you this time.

03:00.147 --> 03:03.117
They're gonna go away
after a minute or two.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.285
You just, uh,
you keep him quiet.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.554
-(car approaches, tires squeal)
-Yes, ma'am, I will.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.790
-(horn honking)
-Oh, uh, there he is.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.860
Oh, uh, Jenny, I didn't have
time to give Buddy a supper,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.863
but there's hot dogs and
there's baked beans in the oven,

03:15.863 --> 03:19.032
and, uh, I set the timer
to go off when they're ready.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.267
Okay.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.269
-(parakeet squawking)
-Night, now.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.338
-PARAKEET: Shut up! Shut up!
-Oh...

03:24.338 --> 03:27.341
lwish Harry would teach that
thing something more... refined.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.675
PARAKEET:
Shut up!

03:28.675 --> 03:30.811
Oh, and I'm gonna call you
from the reception.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.813
Buddy, honey, Mama's leaving.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.114
Bye-bye.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.349
PARAKEET:
Shut up! Shut up!

03:35.349 --> 03:37.117

-Thank you.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.352
(parakeet squawking)

03:38.352 --> 03:41.255
Oh, and, uh, would you let
the dog in if he barks?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.289
JENNIFER:
Mm-hmm. (laughs)

03:42.289 --> 03:43.722
-Good night.

04:16.723 --> 04:19.293

04:21.762 --> 04:23.764
-Hi, Jennifer!
-(|aughs): Hi!

04:23.764 --> 04:24.932
How you doing?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.633
Look, I got all new things!

04:26.633 --> 04:28.335
Yeah, I can see.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.204
Wow, they're really great.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.705
Well, who's that one?

04:31.705 --> 04:34.241
That's Fork Man--
he destroys all the bad ones,

04:34.241 --> 04:35.242
-then he eats them.
-Mm-hmm.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.678
Bottle Man can climb up walls!

04:37.678 --> 04:39.980
-And Pin Man can pinch
-Hey, Buddy. Buddy, Buddy.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.549
Listen, don't get too excited,
'cause I promised your mom

04:42.549 --> 04:44.718
-we wouldn't this time.
-I know, I know.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.155
I remember the last time you got
so mad when I started to cough.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.756
I wasn't really mad, Buddy. l...

04:49.756 --> 04:51.959
l was just a little scared,
that's all.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.127
I've been making
something else, Jennifer.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.529
Want to see it?

04:55.529 --> 04:56.962
Mm-hmm.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.803
Press it.

whooshing continues)

05:27.461 --> 05:29.463
Isn't it superb?

05:29.463 --> 05:32.227
It's me Eater, my Noise Eater.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.049
Um...

05:49.049 --> 05:50.450
Yeah.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.752
It's cute.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.287
What does it do?

05:53.287 --> 05:55.016

Yeah, but, um, what happened?

06:17.110 --> 06:20.047
lt ate its noise--
there's no more noise.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.615
Oh, that's neat.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.884
-Your dad build this for you?
-No.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.286
He started it,
but I finished it.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.948
He's been gone
a long time anyway.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.182
He's still away
at that convention, huh?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.634
I think
the Eater's great, Buddy.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.402
I'm impressed.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.237
Seriously, I am.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.175
Hang on a sec.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.945
You gonna talk to your boyfriend
all night?

06:51.945 --> 06:54.573
How do you know it's him?

06:56.383 --> 06:58.385
(phone continues ringing)

06:58.385 --> 07:00.046
Hello?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.756
Hi.
(laughs)

07:02.756 --> 07:05.425
Yeah, I was hoping it'd be you.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.258
Yeah, it's just me
and Buddy, mm-hmm.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.898
Um...

07:11.898 --> 07:13.900
yeah, I think so.

07:13.900 --> 07:17.037
-(dog barking in distance)
-Yeah, I think she'll let me go.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.606
Well, I should...
I should be free, yeah.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.808
Well, I mean,
I wouldn't want to say,

07:21.808 --> 07:23.910
like, definitely
or anything, but...

07:23.910 --> 07:25.445
No, that'd be good.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.314
Oh, well, Buddy,
he's just, like,

07:27.314 --> 07:29.983

Yes, I do, too.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.065
Why?

08:18.065 --> 08:21.768
(laughs)
Would you stop it?

08:41.354 --> 08:42.556
We'll play then.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.958
You gonna make out with him
all night?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.994
I am not making out.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.563

No, I wouldn't even know
what you're talking about.

I don't know.

Hush. Hush. Shh.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.028

12:15.235 --> 12:18.438
-(clunking, Buddy coughing)
-Buddy, stop coughing, please.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.307
I... I c-can't.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.941
Well, you must remember
how to work it.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.410
How's it work?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.537
All the control
was in the remote.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.214
Was in the remote.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.816
Well, why? Why?!

12:29.816 --> 12:32.485
So you could turn it on...
from anywhere.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.154
Well, what about turning it off?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.655
How do you turn it off?

12:35.655 --> 12:36.815
You can't. Not...

12:37.891 --> 12:39.392
(rapid clunking)

12:39.392 --> 12:41.294
-Oh, my God.
-(coughing)

12:41.294 --> 12:42.829
Go away!

12:42.829 --> 12:44.558
Leave us alone!

12:48.301 --> 12:50.292
(soft, breath-like whooshing)

12:52.372 --> 12:54.363

13:23.970 --> 13:25.271
Mom.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.506
Jimmy.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.576
(phone continues ringing)

13:29.576 --> 13:31.567
Come on.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.815
(clattering)

13:35.815 --> 13:37.806
Damn!

13:39.886 --> 13:41.855
(phone stops ringing)

13:41.855 --> 13:43.948
There.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.655
(whirring and clacking)

14:01.641 --> 14:03.443
Jennifer.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.677
Shh.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.280
(whirring)

14:07.280 --> 14:09.578
(tortured squeaking)

14:12.919 --> 14:15.444

14:24.464 --> 14:26.625
(whoosh)

14:30.136 --> 14:32.739
Buddy, listen to me.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.175
You said you can't
stop it unless...

14:35.175 --> 14:36.709
Unless what?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.011
Maybe...

14:38.011 --> 14:39.746
What? What?!

14:39.746 --> 14:41.581
If you could
get the cover off,

14:41.581 --> 14:43.283
maybe you could short-circuit
its motor.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.285
Well, wouldn't it feel me
doing that?

14:45.285 --> 14:47.187
No.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.389
But it would hear you.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.380
(refrigerator humming softly)

15:02.635 --> 15:06.072

15:11.578 --> 15:12.812
(heart beating)

15:12.812 --> 15:15.148
I... I can hear your heart.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.616
It's okay, Buddy.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.252
But after the Eater
eats everything else,

15:19.252 --> 15:20.920
it'll hear our hearts.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.355
(clock chiming)

15:22.355 --> 15:24.424
Shh.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.416

-MRS. WARREN: Jennifer? Buddy?

15:43.009 --> 15:44.711
Kids, why didn't you...?

15:44.711 --> 15:47.647
Buddy, what's going on?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.682
Oh, my God!

15:49.682 --> 15:51.284
What is that?

15:51.284 --> 15:53.253
No! Will you get away!

15:53.253 --> 15:54.988
Oh. Oh, my God!

15:54.988 --> 15:56.456
-No!
-(g|ass breaks)

15:56.456 --> 15:58.890
No! No! Stop! No!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.506
J‘ I'm longing to kiss J‘

17:20.506 --> 17:22.976

sauce. -Yes, Sean.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.945
