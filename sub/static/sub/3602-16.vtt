01:01.437 --> 01:02.847
My name is Hana Gitelman.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.853
How the hell did you do that?

01:05.483 --> 01:08.441
Satellite signals.
Wi-Fi. Radio waves.

01:08.611 --> 01:11.068
Your computer can
download them and so can I.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.906
So you can access the Internet
without a computer,

01:15.159 --> 01:16.945
just pull e-mail
out of your head?

01:20.748 --> 01:22.329
And you're radioactive.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.998
Why come to me?

01:26.128 --> 01:28.414
Because they got to me, too.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.670
I can find them, Ted,
and you can nuke them.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.055
NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.842
Turned on the waterworks,
and they were mine.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.552
They're getting the suitcase
as we speak.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.433
Where's the bag?

01:46.524 --> 01:49.436
You may fool Ando,
but you do not fool me.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.100
(GRUNTS)

01:51.195 --> 01:53.186
Matt Parkman,
here to protect you, sir.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.192
Sir, we've got to get
out of here right now.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.238
This is a setup.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.107
MALSKY:
What? How do you know that?
MATT: ljust do.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.158
CLAUDE: Now, you absorb all
these abilities that you find.

02:00.246 --> 02:02.453
Now, I'm gonna teach you
how to pull them out
one at a time.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.905
I don't have
to do anything!

02:04.000 --> 02:04.989
Except fly.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.955
MOHINDER:
Hello, Zane Taylor?

02:13.217 --> 02:15.879
Yes, you must be Dr. Suresh.
Come on in.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.048
There are others out there,
like you.

02:18.389 --> 02:19.925
And I am going
to find them.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.968
I could go with you.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.015
She had an appointment
with a neurologist.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.889
Your mother's been having
some headaches.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.892
Yeah, she's also been
having some memory loss.
Did you tell them that?

02:30.234 --> 02:32.600
I don't know
any Mr. Muggles,

02:33.487 --> 02:34.988
and I don't know you.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.071
Dad!

02:42.747 --> 02:43.862
Dad!

02:46.417 --> 02:47.452
Dad!

02:48.502 --> 02:50.914
Where's Dad?
He's on one of his
stupid business trips.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.336
There's something
wrong with Mom.

02:52.423 --> 02:53.959
There's something
wrong with you.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.047
Mom?

02:57.887 --> 02:59.752
Do you know who this is?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.425
Claire, leave
your brother alone.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.802
You recognize us?

03:05.144 --> 03:08.557
Yes, you are the daughter
who is supposed to be
setting the dinner table.

03:09.065 --> 03:12.774
l was standing right there
just a minute ago and you
had no idea who I was.

03:12.943 --> 03:17.186
Lyle, help your sister
with the table.
Honestly, Claire.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.443
Good thing Dad's not home,
'cause he would
so drug test you.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.493
It's good you called us,
Isaac.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.453
I didn't know
who else to trust.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.543
That man, Peter Petrelli,

03:37.635 --> 03:39.842
he's gonna be
responsible for all this.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.672
I tried finding him.
I kept painting what
I thought were empty spaces.

03:44.767 --> 03:45.882
But, now?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.352
There, in the water.

03:49.647 --> 03:50.887
Footprints.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.142
So,

03:53.234 --> 03:54.690
Peter is invisible?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.017
(CHUCKLES)

03:56.404 --> 03:57.985
That sounds so crazy.

03:58.114 --> 04:00.400
Any more than a man
who can paint the future?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.527
Peter absorbs
others' abilities.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.451
Apparently, he's met someone
who we assumed was dead.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.497
That's the roof of the...
The Deveaux building.

04:11.627 --> 04:16.462
Look, there's a chance
that Peter might come here
first before we reach him.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.596
What do you expect me
to do with this?

04:32.064 --> 04:33.440
Save the world.

05:03.554 --> 05:04.714
(SIGHS)

05:12.563 --> 05:14.178
Hey.
Hey.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.604
You know what?
Let me do that.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.852
I am pregnant not porcelain.
I know.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.558
I'm just trying
to be Mr. Helpful, here.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.609
Try Mr. Get the hell
out of the way.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.117
What did you do?

05:39.340 --> 05:40.580
Do you like it?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.378
I love it.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.885
I do.
Yeah?

05:47.473 --> 05:49.634
Matt, we can't afford this.
I mean, we're...

05:49.725 --> 05:52.808
No, come on. I got a guy.
He gave it to me
wholesale, so...

05:59.318 --> 06:00.854
I'm so bloated.

06:00.945 --> 06:04.028
You look so beautiful to me.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.155
(SIGHING) I'm sorry.

06:08.035 --> 06:12.449
You've made
this beautiful gesture
and l have to mess it up.

06:13.791 --> 06:14.997
What do you mean?

06:15.626 --> 06:17.412
A man called yesterday.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.879
A Professor Suresh.
He was a geneticist.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.965
He wanted to talk about DNA.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.295
About your DNA.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.844
Did you tell him anything?
I mean, you didn't tell him
anything, did you?

06:32.935 --> 06:34.641
Of course I didn't
tell him anything.

06:34.979 --> 06:36.469
But he found you.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.429
He knows.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.477
Geneticist.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.358
Who are these people?

07:01.380 --> 07:02.495
For what?

07:02.673 --> 07:05.335
Well, you know,
for bringing me with you.
You didn't have to do that.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.589
It would have been
a long road alone.
I'm glad for the company.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.965
Well, I believe in fate,
Mohinder, and karma.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.513
And I'm notjust saying that
'cause you're Indian.

07:13.601 --> 07:16.934
I mean,
you really came to my rescue
and Iwon't forget that.

07:17.021 --> 07:19.808
Well, it's not
completely altruistic
on my part, Zane.

07:19.898 --> 07:23.265
I have a feeling we're going
to meet up with a lot of
skepticism from these people.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.941
You can help.
I'm ready.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.188
MOHINDER: Excuse me?

07:32.703 --> 07:33.943
Excuse me?

07:35.706 --> 07:36.866
Oh...

(RAP MUS/C PLAYING ON WALKMAN)

07:39.460 --> 07:40.620

Rap music.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.705
Can't stand it,
but it's the only thing I've
found that cancels out the...

07:46.884 --> 07:48.124
Can I help you?

07:48.385 --> 07:50.376
We're looking
for Dale Smither.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.086
You found her.
Oh.

07:52.681 --> 07:56.515
Of course.
I'm Mohinder Suresh
and this is Mr. Taylor.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.968
Well, it's Zane, actually.
It's just Zane.

07:59.063 --> 08:01.099
I left you
several messages this week.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.430
Yeah, I got them

08:02.733 --> 08:05.019
I believe I can help with
what's happening to you.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.691
I'm sure you have
lots of questions.

08:06.779 --> 08:09.191
Yeah, only one.
How'd you find me?

08:09.281 --> 08:12.819
You gave blood 11 years ago,
signed a consent form
to have a sample

08:12.910 --> 08:15.526
used in a program called
the Human Genome Project.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.028
You dialed the wrong number.

08:18.499 --> 08:22.117
Look, I know what you're
thinking right now, that
you've got nobody to talk to,

08:22.211 --> 08:24.452
nobody that understands
what you're going through.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.297
But that's not true.
I understand.

08:30.636 --> 08:31.751
Yeah?

08:50.864 --> 08:51.944
Damn.

08:54.118 --> 08:55.574
That was my best wrench.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.831
So, there
really are others, huh?

08:59.915 --> 09:02.748
Yes. I'm proof of that.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.833
That's why we're here.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.956
I thought the headaches
at first were gonna kill me.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.134
I'd lie awake at night
thinking that my head
was gonna explode.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.800
A cockroach crawling across
my neighbor's floor was

09:17.891 --> 09:21.008
like a marching band
parading through my house.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.886
I'm sorry.
It must be quite a burden.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.641
A burden?

09:25.858 --> 09:27.098
(LAUGHS)

09:27.192 --> 09:28.307
Hell, no.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.775
This is the best damn thing
that ever happened to me.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.569
Well, now that I've learned
to control it,

09:32.656 --> 09:35.113
I'm like Superman
or something.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.775
I can hear rain coming
from 40 miles away.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.952
I can even hear
someone's moods.

09:56.346 --> 10:00.430
No. I'm just excited
to meet somebody like me.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.352
Well, if you've come to try
to take it away from me,

10:05.439 --> 10:07.179
you're gonna have a hell
of a fight on your hands.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.060
I can assure you,
we only want to help.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.769
I'd like to perform
a few tests, some questions,
really, that's all.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.728
Shouldn't take more
than a couple hours.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.064
I'm kind of backed up today.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.740
We can come back
in the morning.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.120
Okay.

10:59.243 --> 11:00.528
I come in peace.

What's an Ando?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.450
Ando is my friend.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.578
I bring him from Japan
on my mission.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.828
Where's the suitcase?

11:13.382 --> 11:15.919
She say her name Hope.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.750
Tell me where they are!

11:18.762 --> 11:21.469
Take me with you.
I must save Ando.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.923
Not a chance.
I work alone, pal.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.142
You take me with you,

11:28.230 --> 11:31.814
or she gets away, pal.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.145
I so miss you, Karen.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.315
I miss your laugh.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.402
But they're gonna pay
for what they did to me.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.282
What they did to us.

like what I got to do.

sorry friends has telekinesis?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.244
None of them do.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.749
Oh, wait, that guy who was
chasing Claire in Texas.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.046
He sent some
lockers flying at me.

that little trick out
in the here and now.

a chance at stopping you
from going nuclear.

every building empty.

left New York.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.904
Why does
this seem so familiar?
Oh, now I remember.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.528
You'd get that same look
on your face when you'd
lie to me about using.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.410
You think I'm lying?

13:56.712 --> 13:59.829
You're right.
I can't willingly throw you
into another man's arms.

Because he's dangerous.

just sit there and shut up.

is either drag you under
or screw you over.

by believing in you.

who wanted to help the girl?

Take your car?

15:13.789 --> 15:14.824
Ando.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.664
You take on a partner,

15:18.001 --> 15:20.993
all you get is
their blood on your hands.

15:29.179 --> 15:32.797

to your mother's house.

The less questions you ask,
Ando, the better off
youWIbeinlWe.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.843
Why is that?

15:38.396 --> 15:40.057
That'd be another question.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.188
Here, Iwill help you
with your bag.
No, I've got it.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.406
It's okay.
Let me help you.
No, I've got it!

15:51.785 --> 15:53.116
What is this?

15:57.833 --> 16:00.040
What did I say
about asking questions?

16:06.383 --> 16:11.548
Now, I have to admit, Zane,
when you first offered
to help, I was cautious.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.798
In what way?

16:12.889 --> 16:14.800
I don't know you.
You don't know me.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.506
It could have been a disaster.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.556
But you made
a difference today.
Thank you.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.724
Here's your key.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.145
When you told that woman
Dale you could help her,

16:30.115 --> 16:31.400
is that really possible?

16:31.908 --> 16:35.366
It's only theoretical
at this point, but I am
working on an inhibitor.

16:35.453 --> 16:39.162
A chemical that will isolate
the genetic mutation that
causes these abnormalities.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.241
I mean,
we can offer these people
understanding, control,

16:42.586 --> 16:44.793
onifneeded,
elimination of their ability.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.460
Elimination?
You make it sound like
a virus or plague.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.133
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to imply. It's just...

16:52.554 --> 16:54.966
Well, not all of you
exhibit the same
sets of skills you do.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.671
I mean,
they could be dangerous.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.425
My father had to
learn that firsthand.

17:01.730 --> 17:02.936
How's that?

17:04.274 --> 17:07.141
He was murdered
by a man named Sylar.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.979
Well, what happened
to this Sylar?

17:13.909 --> 17:15.115
I'm not sure.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.443
He just got away
with killing your dad?

17:19.414 --> 17:21.621
I only know he's gone,
locked away.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.039
I mean,
what does it matter?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.913
Even if I could come
face to face with him,
what difference would it make?

17:26.004 --> 17:27.960
Justice can never
really be served.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.296
What a shame.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.087
They're out there.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.640
I can feel them.

17:38.475 --> 17:41.592
So innocent, so unaware
of what's happening to them.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.512
We'll find them, Mohinder,

17:47.776 --> 17:49.858
all of them, together,
the two of us.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.066
It's our destiny.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.078
I'm gonna call it a night.
Yeah.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.952

18:22.227 --> 18:23.307
Yes.

18:24.896 --> 18:28.354
Mom, you know
how you sometimes
forget things?

18:28.858 --> 18:32.442
Honey, is this about
my trip to the neurologist?
It's just some headaches.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.482
I don't want you to worry.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.236
But they don't know
what's causing it, right?

18:40.537 --> 18:44.200
We are still waiting on
the results from the tests.

18:45.208 --> 18:50.703
What if it's not something
that's responsible for it,
but someone?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.669
What on Earth
are you talking about?

18:55.051 --> 18:58.919

and they had a way
to brainwash you?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.852
I know this is
a little scary,

19:16.323 --> 19:18.609
but Dad's in charge
of talking to the doctors

19:18.700 --> 19:20.816
and they will come up
with the answers.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.200
Maybe you shouldn't
trust Dad so much.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.452
Now, why would you say that?

19:28.543 --> 19:32.502

The birds.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.896

hate everything, everyone,

20:00.492 --> 20:02.824
except you treat
these pigeons like
they're family.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.613
Charles Darwin bred pigeons
when he was working out
his theory of evolution.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.958
Married up
various permutations
to get maximum potential.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.837
What do you mean by that,
maximum potential?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.627

Hey, what's up?

22:00.069 --> 22:01.229
The ring.

22:02.572 --> 22:07.236
I took it to get resized,
and the jeweler told me
it was worth $40,000.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.117
Well, that's ridiculous.

22:10.205 --> 22:11.991
Then he accused me
of stealing it.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.665
I had to tell him my husband
was a cop and there has to be
some kind of an explanation.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.458
There is an explanation,
right?

22:26.137 --> 22:28.594

protecting, Malsky,

22:29.933 --> 22:31.093

You were gonna get upset,
and with the...
You let me keep the ring!

22:43.696 --> 22:45.948
It was stolen property.
What were you thinking?

I don't know
what I was thinking.
I have no idea.

Has your mother had any recent
exposure to radiation?

30:30.871 --> 30:32.372

30:34.959 --> 30:38.872
Claire, if this is a result
of domestic violence...

30:38.963 --> 30:42.080
No. No, it's not like that.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.003
Not really.

Anything you say will be held
in the strictest confidence.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.815
There's a man

31:05.656 --> 31:07.521
who works for my dad.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.450
He can make you
forget things.

Anything.

31:15.124 --> 31:17.160
Just by touching you
with his hands.

I'll talk to your father.

Wait!
I'm telling you the truth!

31:40.483 --> 31:41.598
Hey.

31:41.692 --> 31:44.274
I only came here because
you said it was a matter
of life and death.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.443
You can't go blowing
anything else up.

31:46.697 --> 31:48.403
I found out what these are.

31:48.783 --> 31:51.570
They're tracking us
like animals.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.406
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

31:54.497 --> 31:55.657
The truth.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.864
Hey! What's going on? Ted?

31:57.958 --> 32:00.335
She's a friend, okay?
Like us.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.660
She's the one who put me
on to the scratches.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.208
It comes from
a pneumatic needle.

32:05.925 --> 32:09.838
It injects a radioisotope
for tracking viruses
in Africa.

32:10.054 --> 32:13.672
That's what we are to them.
A virus. Plague.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.473
Who's them?

32:16.560 --> 32:20.473
A shipment of needles
went to Primatech Paper
in Odessa, Texas.

32:21.148 --> 32:25.642
The tracking slip went
to a man named Bennet.
Sound familiar?

32:25.903 --> 32:28.645
I've already
been down this road.
Trust me, it's a dead end.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.149
Really?
Yeah.

32:30.866 --> 32:35.235
Why would a paper company
need pneumatic needles
with a radioisotope?

32:37.248 --> 32:40.615
I had my blood tested.
It's in me, that isotope.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.579
Ted, you're radioactive
by nature.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.002

it's in you, too?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.754
No, that's insane. No!

thing behind me.

a baby coming.

Wait, you've got a family,

32:52.721 --> 32:54.257
that means you've got
something to protect.

32:54.348 --> 32:56.680
There is no putting
this whole thing behind you.

32:56.767 --> 32:59.509
We've got to find out
what they did
and make them fix it.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.185
If they can track us,
like you say they can,
he'll know we're coming!

33:02.273 --> 33:03.353
Good.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.308
I can get us through any
wall they got. I need you
to get inside his head.

if you're there.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.773

to let us take her
home in the morning.

talk to you outside?

34:11.842 --> 34:15.300
Doctor told me you had
an interesting theory about
your mom's condition.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.797
It's not a theory.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.968
You did this to her.
You erased her mind.

34:21.352 --> 34:23.764
Claire, that's ridiculous.

34:23.854 --> 34:25.390
You tried to erase mine.

34:25.481 --> 34:27.437

you're getting these ideas.

isn't that enough?

looking for you.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.675

your mother instead,

34:59.014 --> 35:00.345
