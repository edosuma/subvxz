WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:04.087
- I'm really glad I tried
being with a girl.

00:04.087 --> 00:05.297
It was such an enlightening
experience for me,

00:05.297 --> 00:07.424
you know, sexually
and spiritually.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.384
I feel like I learned
a lot about myself.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.511
- What did you learn?

00:10.511 --> 00:12.804
- I like a dick.
I do.

00:12.804 --> 00:13.847
I--you know,
it was great

00:13.847 --> 00:15.140
when she was going down on me,

00:15.140 --> 00:16.475
but you're already
so good at that,

00:16.475 --> 00:17.976
that at a certain point,
I was like,

00:17.976 --> 00:18.977
"Okay, penis please."

00:18.977 --> 00:21.104
But her kissing, wow.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.439
She was a revelation.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.191
- Revelation?
- Oh, yeah.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.817
It was a whole other level.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.778
- Other level different?
Higher?

00:27.778 --> 00:28.779
- Oh, God, way higher.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.280
She knows what girls like.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.949
Or at least she knows
what this girl likes.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.325
- Jeez, why didn't you tell me
how bad I was?

00:33.325 --> 00:34.826
- No, you're not bad.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.328
It's just she's insanely good.

00:36.328 --> 00:37.538
- Well, that's totally unfair,

00:37.538 --> 00:38.705
'cause she's got gorgeous lips.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.040
I got thin lips.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.625
- God, she does
have gorgeous lips.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.960
They're like soft, juicy,
luscious pillows.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.711
- Christ, I got to start
using Chapstick.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.589
- Babe, babe, this is an area
you can't compete on.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.133
She is a gorgeous girl
who kisses other gorgeous girls

00:50.133 --> 00:52.719
all the time; she's like the
gorgeous girl whisperer.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.638
- Well, I want to be
the best kisser you ever had.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.306
- Oh.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.100
- I want to start kissing you
like a lesbian lover.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.601
- Ew!

00:59.601 --> 01:00.894
- Well, I thought
that's what you want.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.980
- No, I want you to kiss
like a guy

01:02.980 --> 01:04.856
who learned how to kiss
like a lesbian.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.650
- Jesus Christ, how am I
gonna do that?

01:06.650 --> 01:08.569
- I'll take mental notes
the next few times I kiss Davvy.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.028
We're gonna pretend
to be a lesbian couple

01:10.028 --> 01:11.530
for a little while.
- Why?

01:11.530 --> 01:13.657
- Because she has 47,000
followers on Instagram.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.700
That's why.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.701
I want waffles.

01:15.701 --> 01:16.785
You want waffles?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.120
Please take me.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.822
- You want me to ask Davvy
for oral sex advice.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.199
- Gigi said she's amazing,
like, the queen of cunnilingus.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.534
- Okay, honey, I don't think
you should be

03:20.534 --> 03:22.369
talking to Gigi about stuff
like that, okay?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.454
That's not a normal
mother-daughter area.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.123
- We're not a normal
mother-daughter, John.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.666
We have a very healthy
relationship.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.334
She brought up the area.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.335
I made a mental note.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.420
- Okay, but meanwhile,

03:31.420 --> 03:32.963
Davvy's still fake dating Gigi.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.297
I don't want to be in the kind
of relationship

03:34.297 --> 03:35.632
where my real daughter
finds out

03:35.632 --> 03:37.509
from her surrogate mom
that her actual dad

03:37.509 --> 03:39.469
is lousy in bed.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.679
Did that even make sense?

03:40.679 --> 03:42.097
- Yes.
Unfortunately, it did.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.640
And you are not lousy in bed.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.934
You just need a little help,
like most guys do.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.936
- So what,
I've been doing it wrong

03:47.936 --> 03:49.479
the last, like, 25 years?

03:49.479 --> 03:50.772
- Oh, not the whole time.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.898
- What does that mean?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.109
- And you're always very...

03:54.109 --> 03:55.944
- What?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.654
- Eager.
- Oh, my God.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.197
- And sometimes,
you wander into

03:59.197 --> 04:00.907
some really great zones
and rhythms

04:00.907 --> 04:02.409
that really get me off.
- Holy shit.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.286
- Why not take the chance
to sit down

04:04.286 --> 04:05.954
and learn something new
that would make

04:05.954 --> 04:09.291
me orgasm every time?

04:09.291 --> 04:12.002
- Well, first of all,
because it's embarrassing

04:12.002 --> 04:14.713
to be asking people, you know,

04:14.713 --> 04:16.840
"Teach me how to give head,
please."

04:20.343 --> 04:23.013
- You could ask Flash.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.015
- And why would I ask Flash?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.349
Oh, my God.
Don't tell me.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.851
He's great at it, right?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.227
- Okay.
I won't tell you.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.812
- Ugh, classic.
Of course, of course.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.397
He's the king of cunnilingus,

04:32.397 --> 04:34.649
and I'm Johnny the eager
little eighth grader.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.860
- [groans]
It is not a competition.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.445
You are good at kissing.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.988
He's good at oral sex.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.573
It's a tie, okay?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.200
- But there's no question
there's definitely

04:43.200 --> 04:46.787
more prestige
in the oral sex area.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.538
Honey, honey,
tell you what.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.748
Listen.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.041
Let me make you come right now,
okay?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.417
I'm--no, listen to me.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.710
I'm totally pumped.
I'm really psyched.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.629
I'm completely in the zone.

04:55.629 --> 04:59.007
I can make this happen
right now.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.594
Too eager, I know,
sorry, shit.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.346
- I'm gonna talk to Davvy,
okay?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.223
Make sure she doesn't
say anything to Gigi,

05:06.223 --> 05:07.641
and then you are gonna sit
down with her

05:07.641 --> 05:09.684
and get some very important
information

05:09.684 --> 05:14.856
that we are gonna put
to great use immediately.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.108
Do it for me.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.653
Do it for us.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.571
Please.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.365
- All right.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.743
Ugh.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.286
You know what?
Maybe--

05:28.286 --> 05:29.955
I just--I'm gonna do
some deep research online.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.207
Because that way it'll
just stay secret, hon.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.382
- You're afraid of change.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.925
- I'm afraid of change?
- Yeah.

05:41.925 --> 05:42.926
You chickened out
on the whole lesbian thing.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.344
- I didn't chicken out.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.887
I turned into a lesbian,
and then I turned back.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.181
That's two changes
in less than 24 hours.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.016
Plus, I tried a new
skin cream today,

05:50.016 --> 05:51.184
so that's actually three.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.769
- Right.
- I want a change.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.187
I want a passion.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.730
I want something
that consumes me, you know?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.190
- What do you mean?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.441
- You should dance.
You should be a dance teacher.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.026
- Oh.
I'd--

06:00.026 --> 06:01.695
- You love to dance!
- That's a great idea!

06:01.695 --> 06:02.988
- Yeah, but you know what,
I don't think you can just

06:02.988 --> 06:04.406
become a dance teacher,
honey.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.615
I think you got to get, like,
certified.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.075
- John, I went to school
for dance.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.493
I trained as a dancer.
I was gonna be a dancer

06:08.493 --> 06:09.995
until I met you,
and I am goddamn good at it.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.413
And you know what?
- Hmm?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.206
- Will you kill me?
I really want sushi.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.541
- No, we don't need waffles.
- Okay, yeah.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.293
- The waffle place is--

06:16.293 --> 06:18.295
- I just want something big
in my life, you know?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.963
Like I made a difference.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.464
- Like Habitat for Humanity?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.216
- No, not a difference
in the world at large,

06:23.216 --> 06:24.926
a difference in my world.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.970
I blew my chance
saving the planet

06:26.970 --> 06:28.638
'cause I was too busy
blowing your father

06:28.638 --> 06:30.265
literally and emotionally,

06:30.265 --> 06:31.933
always putting his dreams
out in front.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.393
- Okay,
let's be honest.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.895
It's always been kind of
a two-way street,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.396
like mutual support
kind of thing.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.024
- Oh, really?
Mutual two-way street thing

06:39.024 --> 06:40.817
going on, you mean where you
were out in front

06:40.817 --> 06:42.736
being the star in the spotlight,
and I was shoved

06:42.736 --> 06:44.571
in the back, like,
barely lit?

06:44.571 --> 06:47.407
No, honey, this has been a
one-way street, okay?

06:47.407 --> 06:49.034
Me driving you.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.577
You're a 50-year-old man

06:50.577 --> 06:53.038
who still acts
like a 15-year-old boy,

06:53.038 --> 06:56.958
and I'm a 45-year-old woman
who acts...

06:56.958 --> 06:58.835
Like a 45-year-old woman.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.170
- Okay.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.504
Honey?
- Oh, my God.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.131
- Let's relax.
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.674
- If you think about it,
when we talked

07:04.674 --> 07:06.885
about you being the lead singer
or just going out

07:06.885 --> 07:08.511
like that one gig where you
had to sing,

07:08.511 --> 07:10.513
like, three songs in a row,
you had massive panic attacks.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.140
- I know, I know.
John, I know, okay?

07:12.140 --> 07:14.517
I know, I just--I wanted--
I wanted something

07:14.517 --> 07:15.810
different for my life,
you know?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.228
That's all I'm saying.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.314
I thought everything
was gonna be different.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.857
- You're okay.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.317
It's okay.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.443
You want waffles?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.986
- Yes, waffles.
Let's go.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.155
- But, guys, the sushi joint
is right here.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.573
- Oh, my God, John,
this is exactly

07:28.573 --> 07:29.908
what we're talking about, okay?

07:29.908 --> 07:33.411
You never want to try
anything new.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.621
<i>- Thanks for doing this, Davvy.</i>

07:34.621 --> 07:35.914
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

07:35.914 --> 07:37.374
- Well, I believe
in pussy karma.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.167
You get great head
by putting great head

07:39.167 --> 07:41.169
out into the oral sex universe.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.671
Plus, my pottery class
was canceled.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.757
So here we are.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.801
- Wow, that's
the most realistic drawing

07:47.801 --> 07:49.386
of a vagina I've ever seen
in my life.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.221
- Thank you.
- Oh, you drew it?

07:51.221 --> 07:52.263
- An ex of mine did.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.264
She's an artist.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.349
But it's my vagina.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.809
- Oh.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.144
Well, it's...

07:58.144 --> 07:59.354
magnificent.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.772
- It's a good pussy.
I know.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.816
I'm blessed.
- Yeah.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.359
- Yeah.

08:04.359 --> 08:08.655
- So why am I staring
at a drawing of your pussy?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.240
- Listen,
you're a race car driver,

08:10.240 --> 08:11.783
you want to know an engine
inside and out,

08:11.783 --> 08:13.535
what makes it run best, right?
- Right.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.079
- And every engine's the same,
but also individual,

08:16.079 --> 08:18.206
just like vaginas.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.041
So you might have a little
extra size here,

08:20.041 --> 08:22.752
a little less action there,
but basically,

08:22.752 --> 08:24.129
each pussy has all
the same parts.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.547
- Right, but you know
I, uh--

08:25.547 --> 08:26.965
I've been in several notable
New York City

08:26.965 --> 08:28.466
rock bands over the years.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.135
I've slept with a lot of chicks,
so, you know...

08:30.135 --> 08:32.429
- Sure, yeah, but, you know,
just because you're fat,

08:32.429 --> 08:35.515
doesn't make you a chef,
hmm?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.891
Let me ask you
a couple questions.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.435
- Can I ask one question
before you start?

08:38.435 --> 08:39.769
- Sure.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.940
- Is, uh--is that part
on every girl?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.734
- This is gonna take
longer than I thought.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.370
- Mm-mm, no.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.039
No, I'm sorry.
No.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.623
That's what I was
telling you about.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.667
It's too much tongue
way too early.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.127
- Too much tongue, okay.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.378
- It's okay, relax.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.671
There's no rush.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.089
Just--you know the amount
of time you take

09:08.089 --> 09:09.340
when you're going down on me?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.425
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.718
So it's like the same thing.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.428
You know, just nice and easy.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.305
Soft and slow.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.973
Okay?
- Okay.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.391
- Okay.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.146
What are you doing?

09:23.146 --> 09:24.397
- I don't know.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.984
- I feel like
I'm kissing a statue.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.611
- Goddamn you, Flash!

09:29.611 --> 09:31.821
- It's fine.
- It's not fine.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.323
- Look, I think you're
overthinking it now.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.033
Why don't we just--
let's just fuck,

09:35.033 --> 09:36.743
and let's just forget
about kissing, okay?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.703
No more kissing.
- Well, that ain't gonna happen.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.038
'Cause I'm hung up
on the kissing,

09:40.038 --> 09:42.624
and so is Magic Johnson.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.958
- Really?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.210
- So unfair.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.211
I just want to kiss you
like her.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.879
Why can't I learn?

09:47.879 --> 09:51.508
- Well, I love how
emotionally available

09:51.508 --> 09:52.842
you are right now.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.511
- Well, I'm evolving, honey.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.517
- Well, you may be evolving,

10:00.517 --> 10:02.393
but your dick is still stuck
in caveman mode.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.978
Thank God.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.775
- Oh, yeah.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.569
Oh, give me a kiss.
- Uh-uh!

10:11.569 --> 10:15.198
No kissing.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.366
- Do it again.

just finished the lyrics.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.658
They want to do
a full rehearsal.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.076
- Okay, great,
I'll get my bag.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.244
- Why didn't you tell me
I was a bad kisser

11:01.244 --> 11:02.579
when you were seeing me?

11:02.579 --> 11:04.664
- Uh, didn't have time?

11:04.664 --> 11:07.167
- A whole goddamn year?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.793
- Okay, you got to remember,

11:08.793 --> 11:10.587
I had just left Johnny Rock.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.881
Whose ego is so delicate,
you tell him his hair

11:12.881 --> 11:15.300
looks weird, and his dick
doesn't work for a week.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.135
I didn't want to take the chance
of saying

11:17.135 --> 11:18.720
the wrong thing to you
and then having

11:18.720 --> 11:21.973
to spend the next seven days
reconvincing your cock.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.184
Besides,
you gave such great head,

11:24.184 --> 11:25.685
I didn't care about the kissing.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.853
- Thanks.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.605
Gigi's giving me notes,

11:28.605 --> 11:30.982
and every time she wants
to practice, I panic.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.650
- Okay, well, you got to
figure that shit out,

11:32.650 --> 11:33.902
or she's gonna dump your ass.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.278
- I know.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.654
- This is about Gigi's
happiness.

11:36.654 --> 11:39.532
- I know.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.367
- Do you want to practice
on me?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.994
- Huh?

11:42.994 --> 11:45.246
- Well, I mean, who knows
your history of kissing

11:45.246 --> 11:47.248
better than I do?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.917
- Ava, come on.
- Purely clinical.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.419
Like a lab test.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.962
Oh, my God,
you're making it weird.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.632
Just kiss me.
Come here. Jesus.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.467
- Okay, all right.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.889
You ready?
- Yeah.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.779
Yeah.
That's better.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.948
One note, okay?

12:19.948 --> 12:21.950
You need a dash of supple.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.910
You got to relax your
lower lip a little more.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.038
It's still too active.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.289
- Okay.
Try again?

12:28.289 --> 12:31.209
- Yeah.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.961
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.903
[clears throat]

12:58.903 --> 13:01.155
Yeah, that--
technically perfect.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.491
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm, you're welcome.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.329
What are we supposed
to be doing?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.331
- Kissing.
- Uh, no, rehearsal.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.749
- That's right.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.002
- We're going, um,
to rehearsal.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.713
Get my bag.
- Okay.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.131
I'll get my bag.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.264
- Feast, you want to call
the show Feast.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.515
- I know.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.558
Brilliant, right?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.018
- Well, it's not brilliant.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.145
It's the exact opposite
of Famine.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.230
- It's tastefully ironic.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.481
I like it.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.608
- I love it.
- Of course you love it.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.235
It sounds like there's
going to be a buffet.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.653
- That was mean.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.655
I love it because it's good.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.323
It's memorable.
It's got a great ring to it.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.658
That's why I like it.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.035
- Thank you, and you guys
are gonna

13:47.035 --> 13:48.494
need a title
that invites the audience

13:48.494 --> 13:49.954
into the theater, right?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.873
Hey, who remembers seeing
Sting's musical,

13:51.873 --> 13:53.207
"The Last Ship"?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.459
- No.
- Never heard of it.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.918
- Neither did anyone else.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.211
I mean, you guys want people to

13:57.211 --> 13:59.922
come and see the show, correct?
- Yeah.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.841
- I want the right people
to come see our show.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.760
- Rehab, no one knows
what An Gorta Mor means.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.261
- Irish people know.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.013
Educated people know.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.348
- Okay, well, I asked
an Irish friend of mine

14:09.348 --> 14:10.725
who teaches at NYU.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.060
You know what he thought
An Gorta Mor was?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.311
A thyroid medication.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.104
- What do they teach?
Shop?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.440
- The original title
of "Hamilton" was "Burr."

14:17.440 --> 14:19.067
- Because it was so cold
back then.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.152
- No, Bam, no,
because no one

14:21.152 --> 14:22.904
wanted to see a show
about Aaron Burr.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.989
No one wants to see a show
about a fucking ship,

14:24.989 --> 14:26.991
and no one wants
to look up words

14:26.991 --> 14:28.701
on a Gaelic-to-English
online dictionary

14:28.701 --> 14:30.703
before they go buy
a $200 ticket.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.331
- We are trying to make
a dark, edgy,

14:33.331 --> 14:36.584
real song cycle meets
rock opera production here.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.878
We want to make "Hamilton"
look like a puppet show.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.463
- Right, but none of it matters

14:40.463 --> 14:43.091
unless you a get a full house
on opening night.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.635
- I got you,
as composer and creator,

14:45.635 --> 14:47.512
a 4% piece of the box office.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.889
That is unheard of
for someone in your position.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.767
But 4% of nothing
is zero, Rehab.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.061
- Think about it.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.063
Feast.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.397
- Feast.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.072
- Hmm.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.659
You know what you could
call the show?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.828
Go fuck yourself.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.454
Noah, you are supposed
to be the new Jew,

15:13.454 --> 15:16.374
but instead you're acting
like the old Jew.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.752
And you are supposed to be
a creative genius

15:19.752 --> 15:23.464
sent here to help me realize
my vision on stage.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.008
But nope.
No.

15:26.008 --> 15:30.555
Instead, you are two typical
show business Jews--

15:30.555 --> 15:32.849
you know what I mean--
sent to ruin

15:32.849 --> 15:36.060
another Jew's musical endeavor.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.770
You know what? That's a good
name for this show.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.938
Jewsical.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.106
- Oh, my God,
stop saying Jew.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.149
You say Jew all the time.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.400
Stop saying Jew so much.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.904
- Jew, Jew, Jew,
Jew, Jew.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.948
Feast blows.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.159
Almost as much
as the two of you.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.745
I've got something called
artistic integrity, my friends.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.747
Look that up online.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.624
Feast on this.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.918
- Now, just--
- Shut up!

16:00.918 --> 16:04.130
- Feast was Campbell Scott's
idea.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.007
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
did you say Campbell Scott?

16:06.007 --> 16:07.675
The Campbell Scott?

16:07.675 --> 16:09.677
He's from the royal family
of American theater.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.597
His father's George C. Scott,
Patton.

16:12.597 --> 16:16.350
Rehab, this guy does
Shakespeare, bro.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.020
Campbell Scott is the real
goddamn deal, right?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.939
That's great.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.525
- You just heard your name
and Shakespeare's name

16:24.525 --> 16:25.776
in the same sentence.

16:25.776 --> 16:29.322
How often does that happen?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.616
Campbell Scott gives your
production

16:31.616 --> 16:34.410
immediate and legitimate
artistic integrity.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.629
- Do you still remember
December's foggy freeze,

16:44.629 --> 16:47.548
when the ice that clung
onto your beard

16:47.548 --> 16:50.259
was screaming agony?

16:52.637 --> 16:56.349
"Hamlet" is my favorite play.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.434
I am totally in.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.977
- Yes!

16:59.977 --> 17:01.354
- That's not "Hamlet."

17:01.354 --> 17:04.106
- Bro, did the play in college.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.566
I think I know "Hamlet."

17:05.566 --> 17:07.151
- Yeah, it's Jethro Tull,
"Aqualung."

no tongue action.

like tongue action.

like a minute or two?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.386
But not the whole tongue,
just a little bit.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.138
- How little?
- I don't--

21:04.138 --> 21:07.433
Just like a tiny little flick,
sometimes more,

21:07.433 --> 21:11.937
other times less,
other times way less.

- Oh, you could have
given me a little direction.

it was there.
