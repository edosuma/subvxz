<i>Yeah, you okay?</i>

02:09.570 --> 02:10.640
<i>We have it.</i>

02:11.375 --> 02:13.305
<i>Andreas, we have it.</i>

02:14.165 --> 02:15.633
<i>It works.</i>

02:17.313 --> 02:18.472
Jorgen.

02:40.347 --> 02:41.876
It gives me great pleasure

02:42.040 --> 02:42.937
to welcome

02:42.962 --> 02:45.345
the director of the institute
and my old friend,

02:45.384 --> 02:46.853
Dr. Andreas Jacobsen.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.648
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Pereira.

03:02.498 --> 03:05.826
Seventy-five years ago,
Mrs. Nellie Edvardsen,

03:06.068 --> 03:07.841
overcome with guilt
by the fortune

03:07.866 --> 03:09.498
her late husband's
family had amassed

03:09.523 --> 03:12.357
producing mustard gas
during World War I,

03:12.443 --> 03:14.513
founded our institute

03:14.599 --> 03:16.060
so that the wonders of science

03:16.085 --> 03:18.326
could instead be used
to help mankind.

03:18.703 --> 03:20.281
In the 1950s,

03:20.601 --> 03:24.304
the institute identified
over-population

03:24.476 --> 03:28.293
as mankind's single
greatest long-term threat,

03:28.605 --> 03:31.418
the cause of all the catastrophes
we are seeing today--

03:31.489 --> 03:33.520
extreme climate and
weather events,

03:33.591 --> 03:37.130
and the devastating impact
on food and water security.

03:37.715 --> 03:41.262
Among the many solutions we
conceived so many years ago,

03:41.601 --> 03:42.523
one...

03:42.694 --> 03:45.421
which seemed then
so ambitious, so

03:45.484 --> 03:46.718
out of our grasp

03:46.796 --> 03:48.671
has finally borne fruit.

03:48.952 --> 03:50.913
And today we are proud to unveil

03:50.991 --> 03:53.843
what we fervently believe
to be the only practical,

03:53.882 --> 03:58.147
humane and inclusive remedy
to humanity's greatest problem.

03:58.607 --> 03:59.474
My colleague,

03:59.536 --> 04:03.349
Dr. Jorgen Asbjornsen
will now present his findings.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.466
Are you ready, doctor?

04:05.777 --> 04:07.293
Yes, I'm ready.

04:34.994 --> 04:36.713
Please take your seats.

04:38.641 --> 04:41.148
Please sit down, ladies
and gentlemen, please.

04:41.258 --> 04:42.937
Please take your seats,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:42.962 --> 04:44.711
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

04:45.188 --> 04:46.672
Thank you, thank you.

04:52.742 --> 04:55.820
Dr. Pereira, esteemed colleagues.

04:57.382 --> 04:58.789
Five years ago,

04:58.828 --> 05:02.507
building on the research of our
predecessors at the institute,

05:02.645 --> 05:05.497
my team and I
discovered a process

05:05.536 --> 05:08.480
by which all organic
material can be reduced

05:08.543 --> 05:12.411
at the cellular level
by a ratio of approximately

05:12.451 --> 05:15.935
2,744 to one.

05:16.476 --> 05:20.148
Such a process converts
a man of 1.8 meters

05:20.187 --> 05:23.460
to just 12.9 centimeters.

05:23.601 --> 05:26.132
A wide array of flora and fauna

05:26.351 --> 05:28.281
were subjected in this process

05:28.306 --> 05:32.522
and with the exception
of some fish and shellfish,

05:32.547 --> 05:36.077
absolutely no side effects
were detected.

05:36.851 --> 05:38.218
Please, lights.

05:41.316 --> 05:44.761
Once the safety of the
procedure was confirmed,

05:44.863 --> 05:47.121
{\an8}thirty-six brave volunteers

05:47.160 --> 05:49.957
{\an8}joined my wife
Anne-Helene and me

05:49.982 --> 05:53.347
{\an8}as the very first humans
to undergo cellular reduction.

05:53.434 --> 05:56.535
The process is short
and painless,

05:56.602 --> 05:59.665
with only the mild
discomfort of removal

05:59.697 --> 06:02.977
and replacement of dental
and other prosthetics.

06:03.098 --> 06:06.294
The subjects are placed
under light sedation,

06:06.326 --> 06:07.803
and after a brief rest,

06:07.940 --> 06:10.830
fully recover within
an hour or two.

06:17.599 --> 06:20.310
Once completed,
our little village,

06:20.396 --> 06:22.584
just seven meters
by eleven meters,

06:22.638 --> 06:26.435
was place inside
a gas-permeable enclosure

06:26.506 --> 06:30.145
designed to protect us
from the hazards of weather,

06:30.177 --> 06:33.005
animals and insects.

06:33.110 --> 06:35.024
Thus we set about
to live together

06:35.049 --> 06:38.016
in the world's
very first self-sustaining

06:38.041 --> 06:40.017
community of the small.

06:42.389 --> 06:44.475
I hold here in my hand

06:44.577 --> 06:47.045
all of the uncompostable waste

06:47.085 --> 06:50.916
produced by 36 people
over four years.

06:58.890 --> 07:00.460
In this afternoon's session,

07:00.485 --> 07:04.882
we will outline our proposal for a
two to three-hundred year transition

07:04.912 --> 07:08.186
for the world to transform
from big into small.

07:08.631 --> 07:09.904
But for now,

07:10.256 --> 07:13.428
I'd like you all to meet
some very special people.

07:19.237 --> 07:19.924
Bravo!

07:21.790 --> 07:22.375
Yes!

07:25.954 --> 07:26.626
Bravo!

07:45.134 --> 07:48.346
And look,
there is little Ronnie Nesthritt,

07:48.799 --> 07:51.150
the first small baby ever born.

07:51.393 --> 07:54.596
And his new little
sister Ulrikke.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.175
<i>of the Edvardsen Institute,</i>

08:47.207 --> 08:50.800
<i>himself now only ten centimeters
tall and weighing just 18 grams,</i>

08:50.825 --> 08:52.879
<i>explained the rationale
behind the invention.</i>

08:52.972 --> 08:56.744
Wow! That is wild, isn't it?
Just wild.

08:57.252 --> 08:58.151
Say, Holly,

08:58.260 --> 09:00.784
you can go ahead and put
the take-out order in, thanks.

09:22.876 --> 09:25.540
-Is that you?
-Yeah.

09:26.907 --> 09:28.118
You hungry?

09:28.337 --> 09:30.946
I ate about an hour ago.

09:31.024 --> 09:32.891
I didn't know when
you were coming.

09:33.058 --> 09:34.573
You knew I was bringing food.

09:34.598 --> 09:36.308
I called you and
asked you specifically.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.252
-I just had sesame chicken.
-And then you go and eat.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.629
I'm still hungry.

09:39.852 --> 09:41.703
<i>screams premeditation.</i>

09:41.930 --> 09:45.437
<i>Yet relatively few people
knew about his new book.</i>

09:45.938 --> 09:47.586
Did you see the news today?

09:47.806 --> 09:49.759
About the little Swedish man?

09:49.869 --> 09:51.158
Norwegian.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.715
Yeah, Helen called to
tell me to turn on the TV.

09:54.903 --> 09:56.559
What won't they think of next.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.661
Unbelievable. Biggest thing since
landing on the moon. Bigger.

09:59.745 --> 10:00.378
Mm.

10:01.065 --> 10:01.854
I don't get it.

10:01.879 --> 10:04.464
Why would anybody want
to do that to himself?

10:05.069 --> 10:07.155
They can shrink people down,

10:08.007 --> 10:09.288
fly to mars,

10:10.621 --> 10:13.106
and they can't cure
my fibromyalgia?

10:15.975 --> 10:18.818
And all this fuss
about the environment

10:19.037 --> 10:21.600
though the world's gonna
end tomorrow.

10:23.032 --> 10:24.446
I'm in pain.

10:25.188 --> 10:26.634
I can't breathe.

10:26.821 --> 10:28.337
Doesn't that matter?

10:28.685 --> 10:30.778
Lots of people are in pain, Mom.

10:31.919 --> 10:33.458
In all sorts of ways.

11:02.516 --> 11:03.657
Hola Carmen.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.188
<i>Are you ready?</i>

11:05.469 --> 11:06.586
<i>Strong, strong.</i>

11:08.077 --> 11:10.686
<i>Is it usually or more like...</i>

11:11.125 --> 11:11.967
tingling?

11:12.048 --> 11:14.149
-More like tingling.
-Tingling. Okay.

11:15.152 --> 11:18.535
{\an8}<i>This downsizing thing is simply
runaway train technology</i>

11:18.598 --> 11:20.597
{\an8}<i>that's having a
devastating impact</i>

11:20.683 --> 11:22.285
<i>on our world economy.</i>

11:22.364 --> 11:25.715
<i>We're losing billions of dollars
in consumer spending already.</i>

11:25.806 --> 11:27.360
<i>It's hurting us
in construction,</i>

11:27.385 --> 11:29.782
<i>automobile, housing,
and defense.</i>

11:29.859 --> 11:31.648
<i>And then of course,
when we get to politics,</i>

11:31.673 --> 11:33.836
{\an8}<i>-Israelis shrinking Palestinians,
-Ron...</i>

11:33.875 --> 11:35.109
{\an8}<i>African dictators</i>

11:35.134 --> 11:37.125
{\an8}<i>-shrinking rival ethnic groups.
-Ron. Look, Ron.</i>

11:37.225 --> 11:39.607
{\an8}<i>In any major transformation
of society,</i>

11:39.632 --> 11:41.475
{\an8}<i>are there serious growing pains?</i>

11:41.543 --> 11:42.403
{\an8}<i>Sure.</i>

11:42.536 --> 11:44.426
{\an8}<i>But at current mass and volume,</i>

11:44.451 --> 11:47.022
{\an8}<i>human life on Earth
is unsustainable.</i>

11:47.654 --> 11:49.350
You know, that one guy
makes a good point.

11:49.671 --> 11:52.000
This family on my block
just moved away to get small,

11:52.101 --> 11:53.804
now their house
is just sittin' there.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.593
Makin' everybody's values take
a dive is what they're doin'.

11:56.876 --> 11:59.001
Just when I'm tryin'
to refinance.

11:59.111 --> 12:01.619
Marlene thinks I should
do it just to lose the weight.

12:03.975 --> 12:05.295
You and me both, buddy.

12:05.944 --> 12:08.436
Hey, Dee, is that take-out
order about ready?

12:10.938 --> 12:13.251
Hey, honey, I brought food.

12:13.423 --> 12:15.087
I'm not hungry.

12:22.935 --> 12:23.998
What's wrong?

12:25.092 --> 12:26.350
I have a splitting headache.

12:26.756 --> 12:28.748
The store was
super busy and

12:28.818 --> 12:31.310
Carla was a total
bitch on wheels.

12:31.365 --> 12:32.975
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

12:33.248 --> 12:35.037
Here, wait, let me
do the neck thing.

12:35.482 --> 12:37.779
Yeah, do the little neck thing.

12:39.185 --> 12:39.912
Mm.

12:40.285 --> 12:41.512
Just relax, honey.

12:42.926 --> 12:44.348
Let me take all the weight.

12:46.782 --> 12:49.422
Okay, here's the beautiful
formal living room

12:49.485 --> 12:51.173
with the wonderful fireplace.

12:51.624 --> 12:53.944
And come around here,
we have

12:53.984 --> 12:56.640
a nice big breakfast
area for the kitchen.

12:56.935 --> 12:58.490
Big eating area.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.818
And this kitchen
is just a complete wow.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.787
No, it's awesome. Just...

13:05.036 --> 13:06.981
maybe we should look again
at that place in Benson.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.271
Come on, let's just
check out the rest.

13:09.468 --> 13:11.031
This is great in here,

13:11.140 --> 13:13.476
double oven,
six burner gas stove.

13:13.663 --> 13:16.327
It's got this wonderful
butler's pantry over here.

13:57.339 --> 13:59.144
-Oh, hey, Sean.
-Oh, hey, Paul, how you doin'?

13:59.183 --> 14:00.035
Good.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.478
Do I look fat?

14:04.033 --> 14:05.861
No, you look very handsome.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.353
Anesthesiology, huh?

14:11.750 --> 14:14.571
My wife says I put people to sleep
even without the drugs, so.

14:15.577 --> 14:17.054
Surprised you're still awake.

14:17.437 --> 14:19.140
He uses that joke
like twice a week.

14:20.038 --> 14:21.038
What's your field, Paul?

14:21.063 --> 14:22.326
Uh, occupational therapy.

14:22.374 --> 14:23.059
Okay.

14:23.084 --> 14:25.061
Oh, like-like career counseling?

14:25.109 --> 14:27.116
Uh, no, it's just like
physical therapy

14:27.187 --> 14:29.960
but focused on workplace
injuries and rehab,

14:29.985 --> 14:32.796
repetitive stress, lower back,
that sort of thing.

14:33.023 --> 14:34.640
A lot of shoulder problems.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.996
I-I'm in-house over
at Omaha Steaks.

14:37.059 --> 14:39.426
-He does a lot of paperwork.
-Yeah, well...

14:39.473 --> 14:41.473
I get a little carpal tunnel
of my own from time to time.

14:41.551 --> 14:42.534
Tell me about it.

14:42.559 --> 14:45.122
Medicine these days is
all about covering your ass.

14:45.698 --> 14:47.971
But weren't you pre-med
down in Lincoln?

14:48.503 --> 14:50.464
Good memory, yeah.
I put in two years

14:50.503 --> 14:51.995
uh, then my mom got real sick

14:52.020 --> 14:54.221
so I moved back to Omaha
to take care of her.

14:55.393 --> 14:57.378
I wanted to be
a surgeon, actually.

14:57.979 --> 14:59.776
You know, we might've ended
up working together.

14:59.870 --> 15:02.359
I...you could've been
my anesthesiologist.

15:02.407 --> 15:03.883
-How 'bout that?
-Yeah.

15:18.646 --> 15:20.989
Oh, my God! No way.

16:20.489 --> 16:21.465
{\an8}With lime.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.694
Well, actually, we weren't

16:25.719 --> 16:28.068
{\an8}But then, you know, we started
getting all the e-mails.

16:28.201 --> 16:30.623

16:30.693 --> 16:32.724
{\an8}I mean, she's-she's fine,
thank God.

16:32.795 --> 16:34.545
{\an8}But I still needed to see her.

16:34.570 --> 16:35.959
{\an8}So, what's traveling like?

16:35.998 --> 16:37.983
{\an8}How'd you guys get up here
from New Mexico?

16:38.064 --> 16:39.626
Oh, gosh, it's great.

16:39.689 --> 16:42.540
Yeah, the airlines are getting
more and more small-friendly.

16:42.595 --> 16:44.485
All the seats are first-class...

16:44.540 --> 16:46.950
So after a couple of years in
Florida, we moved out to Vegas.

16:46.975 --> 16:47.771
And that...

16:47.810 --> 16:49.677
{\an8}Yeah, I think that's the
last time we talked.

16:49.794 --> 16:51.607
{\an8}Yeah. Well, Vegas wasn't

16:51.632 --> 16:53.552
{\an8}such a good choice for me,
as it turns out.

16:53.685 --> 16:55.146
{\an8}Got into some real bad habits.

16:55.185 --> 16:56.545
{\an8}Pretty much hit rock bottom.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.080
Tell ya, any other woman
would've run for the hills.

16:59.454 --> 17:01.603
Carol, man, she's a saint.

17:01.744 --> 17:02.893
She stuck with me.

17:03.129 --> 17:04.949
But I really had to come
clean about everything.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.300
I-I mean everything.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.050
You know...almost.

17:08.722 --> 17:10.363
So, the decision to...

17:10.542 --> 17:11.869
Well, that's the thing.

17:12.003 --> 17:13.449
We both needed the change.

17:13.613 --> 17:15.808
Hit the reset button.
Start all over.

17:15.973 --> 17:17.559
Well, and plus, it
must feel good to know

17:17.622 --> 17:18.849
you're really making
a difference.

17:19.098 --> 17:21.029
You mean all that crap
about saving the planet?

17:21.114 --> 17:22.083
Yeah.

17:22.189 --> 17:24.689
Downsizing is about
saving yourself.

17:25.157 --> 17:26.673
I-It takes the pressure right off.

17:26.698 --> 17:27.900
Especially money pressure.

17:28.095 --> 17:31.697
I'm just not driven and ambitious
like the rest of my family.

17:31.861 --> 17:33.751
And now, Carol and I,
we live like kings.

17:34.425 --> 17:36.909
I'm still living in the
same house I grew up in.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.482
I mean, Audrey's
dying for us to move

17:39.507 --> 17:41.100
but we're really strapped.

17:41.326 --> 17:44.388
I mean, shit, I just finished
paying off my student loans.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.438
Yeah, well...

17:46.985 --> 17:49.509
Listen, if you ever start
thinkin' about it seriously,

17:50.001 --> 17:51.689
here's my two cents, uh...

17:52.215 --> 17:54.512
There's a lot of small communities
croppin' up out there, but

17:54.600 --> 17:55.520
don't mess around.

17:55.598 --> 17:57.161
Leisureland's where
you wanna be.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.335
Best houses, best appliances,
best doctors.

18:00.421 --> 18:02.109
They book all the
big concert tours.

18:02.171 --> 18:03.374
They got all the
great restaurants.

18:03.523 --> 18:05.539
The kids love
Cheesecake Factory.

18:05.664 --> 18:07.117
And Leisureland's
got three of 'em.

18:07.765 --> 18:10.109
And hey, I'm not just saying
all this for the referral credit.

18:10.171 --> 18:10.937
Just so you know.

18:13.609 --> 18:16.499
I liked little Carol.
She's got a lot on the ball.

18:16.584 --> 18:18.443
She's reading books she
always wanted to read.

18:18.468 --> 18:19.990
She's taking Italian.

18:20.123 --> 18:21.435
And she's never been fitter.

18:21.615 --> 18:23.139
Well, they sure seem happy.

18:23.615 --> 18:25.709
Dave says he's getting
pretty good on the drums.

18:26.536 --> 18:28.739
Next year, they're taking
the kids out of school

18:28.764 --> 18:31.435
to spend six months at a
sister city in Tuscany.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.794
Cooking classes, yoga,
wine-tasting,

18:34.865 --> 18:36.177
the whole nine yards.

18:40.504 --> 18:42.472
<i>Hey, Saf, Audrey, it's Milo.</i>

18:42.793 --> 18:43.832
<i>Bad news.</i>

18:43.942 --> 18:46.840
<i>Your mortgage application at
First National bounced back.</i>

18:46.973 --> 18:49.464
<i>The underwriter didn't like
the income to debt ratios--</i>

18:49.489 --> 18:50.848
<i>they're a little excessive.</i>

18:51.066 --> 18:53.207
<i>I-I don't know if you
can come up with</i>

18:53.232 --> 18:54.957
<i>another ten-fifteen

18:55.444 --> 18:57.247
<i>If you could, maybe
goose it up a little bit...</i>

18:57.509 --> 19:00.517
And then we'll be able to tell
right away if it's for us or not.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.755
Yeah, so let's not
waste a lot of time.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.598
Maybe if we get to Santa Fe early,
we can get a massage.

19:05.794 --> 19:07.060
Sounds good to me.

19:28.894 --> 19:34.832

20:08.104 --> 20:09.300
Welcome, everybody!

20:09.631 --> 20:12.138
I'm Jeff Lonowsky,
Senior Product Specialist

20:12.163 --> 20:14.685
and happy homeowner here
at Leisureland Estates.

20:14.779 --> 20:16.068
You havin' a good time?

20:16.359 --> 20:17.991
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:19.188 --> 20:21.844
Come on, guys, you're a heck
of a lot bigger than I am.

20:21.931 --> 20:24.501
Make some noise!
Are you havin' a good time?

20:24.721 --> 20:26.346
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

20:27.830 --> 20:28.861
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

20:29.080 --> 20:30.682
That's more like it.

20:31.086 --> 20:32.907
So, what do you
think of my place?

20:34.500 --> 20:35.758
Pretty nifty, huh?

20:36.484 --> 20:38.038
It's the house of my dreams.

20:38.155 --> 20:40.538
Heck, I'd say this is the
house of anybody's dreams.

20:40.595 --> 20:43.228
Why, an average guy like me
would have to work twenty,

20:43.295 --> 20:46.482
thirty, maybe forty years
to afford a place like this,

20:46.507 --> 20:47.459
if ever.

20:47.986 --> 20:50.447
And just wait till
you see what's inside.

20:59.107 --> 21:00.216
Oh.

21:00.966 --> 21:01.982
Jeff?

21:03.346 --> 21:06.135
You've gotta stop inviting
guests over without telling me.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.261
Oh, sorry, Laura.
I was only--

21:08.286 --> 21:12.339
I mean, I finally just got in the
tub to relax after such a busy day.

21:12.364 --> 21:13.770
Busy doing what, sweetheart?

21:13.840 --> 21:15.301
Oh, no end of things.

21:15.326 --> 21:17.831
First I took a tennis lesson
and had a massage.

21:17.879 --> 21:18.574
Nice.

21:18.599 --> 21:20.879
And then after a gourmet
lunch with the girls,

21:20.958 --> 21:22.467
well, we couldn't help ourselves

21:22.492 --> 21:25.443
so we popped into that new
Loget's jewelry store downtown.

21:25.507 --> 21:28.640
Uh-oh, Loget's. What's
than gonna cost me?

21:28.814 --> 21:33.017
Now, Jeff, you hush.
I was really good.

21:33.976 --> 21:36.001
Just another diamond bracelet.

21:37.759 --> 21:40.775
Just a diamond bracelet?
That doesn't sound like you.

21:41.413 --> 21:43.748
You're right, I don't
like to break up a set.

21:43.773 --> 21:47.429
So, I got matching
diamond earrings

21:47.538 --> 21:49.702
and a matching diamond necklace.

21:50.313 --> 21:52.954
All conflict-free,
and set in platinum.

21:53.118 --> 21:54.345
How much, Laura?

21:54.482 --> 21:56.919
Oh, but Jeff, they look so good
on me, and you should see--

21:57.005 --> 21:58.341
How much, Laura?

21:58.498 --> 22:00.982
-Well, Jeff...
-I said how much?

22:01.825 --> 22:03.223
Eighty-three dollars.

22:03.716 --> 22:05.902
Eighty-three dollars?
Are you crazy?

22:05.934 --> 22:08.942
Why, that's practically our food
budget for two whole months!

22:09.278 --> 22:10.067
Ah!

22:47.183 --> 22:50.542
Putting it all together, if you
liquidate your current home,

22:50.567 --> 22:52.431
cars and other assets,

22:52.456 --> 22:54.385
and purchase a
Regency-level estate--

22:54.424 --> 22:57.580
remember that's a 12,000
square foot equivalent home

22:57.605 --> 23:02.425
on a 1.5 acre equivalent lot--
at a base price of $63,000.

23:02.495 --> 23:04.378
Then the Health and
Fitness package--

23:04.403 --> 23:06.605
that's $4,500, you're
gonna wanna get that.

23:06.667 --> 23:10.863
It's gym, pool, sauna, steam,
hot tub, and a tennis court.

23:10.888 --> 23:12.605
Then the medical
procedures for two adults.

23:12.630 --> 23:14.183
That's $15,000.

23:14.472 --> 23:16.612
But does insurance
cover any of that?

23:16.798 --> 23:20.891
No, but at the Regency level you
qualify of a substantial discount.

23:21.001 --> 23:22.884
And don't forget the
federal tax credit.

23:22.939 --> 23:23.852
-Right, right.
-Right?

23:23.946 --> 23:26.508
So, taking a look at
your current debt,

23:26.533 --> 23:29.150
you retirement and
your other savings,

23:29.175 --> 23:33.297
you are at $152,000 in equity.

23:33.383 --> 23:35.633
People, that is a very
comfortable number.

23:36.092 --> 23:38.288
Comfortable? That doesn't
sound like nearly enough.

23:38.313 --> 23:39.389
-Yeah.
-Well, no.

23:39.414 --> 23:41.295
See, you have to look
at this column, Audrey.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.507
Equivalent value.

23:42.550 --> 23:45.011
You're solidly inside
the Blue Chip zone.

23:45.042 --> 23:51.308
In Leisureland your $152,000
translates to $12.5 million--

23:51.333 --> 23:53.364
to live on, for life.

23:53.419 --> 23:54.880
I mean, come on!

23:54.905 --> 23:56.411
-Oh.
-Well.

23:58.092 --> 23:59.842
Hold on, if this is
such a good thing,

23:59.867 --> 24:01.445
how come
you haven't done it?

24:01.514 --> 24:03.022
I would do it in a heartbeat

24:03.122 --> 24:04.770
but my husband had
a hip replacement

24:04.795 --> 24:06.200
so he's ineligible.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.482
So, what do you think?

24:08.608 --> 24:10.709
Would the Regency level
be your first choice?

24:10.734 --> 24:14.139
Or should should I show you
something a little more deluxe?

24:18.111 --> 24:19.728
Honey, why don't you
just go ahead and pick.

24:19.753 --> 24:21.150
I just want you to be happy.

24:22.853 --> 24:24.478
That's a good husband.

24:24.586 --> 24:26.125
Take a look at this.

24:27.008 --> 24:29.696
Hey, how much for
the hotdog cooker?

24:31.967 --> 24:32.968
Four dollars.

24:33.436 --> 24:34.905
I'll give you a dollar.

24:35.202 --> 24:36.069
Sold.

24:36.547 --> 24:39.594
Keep up with the exercises.
Don't get lazy. Look.

24:39.882 --> 24:41.450
I laminated it for you,

24:41.475 --> 24:43.561
so you literally have
no excuse not to do it.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.975
Okay, thanks, Paul.
Thanks a lot.

24:45.000 --> 24:45.727
You bet.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.297
Maybe someday me and
my wife will get small

24:47.360 --> 24:48.438
and we'll come down
and see ya.

24:48.463 --> 24:50.575
Well, I'd love that.
But in the meantime...

24:50.600 --> 24:51.880
-Okay?
-All right.

24:51.905 --> 24:53.849
-Just 15 minutes every night.
-Okay.

24:53.874 --> 24:55.262
-It'll change your life.
-Thanks, Paul.

24:55.287 --> 24:56.247
See ya, Dave.

24:56.513 --> 24:58.411
We're here to wish Paul Safranek

24:58.489 --> 25:00.778
farewell as he moves
on to Leisureland.

25:00.864 --> 25:02.700
And we wish him
nothing but the best.

25:02.763 --> 25:04.411
Good luck to you and Audrey.

25:04.997 --> 25:06.160
Thanks, Bob.

25:07.012 --> 25:07.918
Thanks, Bob.

25:14.385 --> 25:16.510
And you guys didn't
consider Treasure Island

25:16.535 --> 25:17.512
out in Palm Desert?

25:17.596 --> 25:19.174
Well, we checked it out, but

25:19.417 --> 25:20.909
I mean, I liked it all right.

25:20.934 --> 25:23.105
But Audrey thought they were
a little stingy with the amenities.

25:23.207 --> 25:24.238
I mean, especially given
what they're charging

25:24.263 --> 25:25.676
in monthly maintenance.

25:25.863 --> 25:29.254
And I just turned to Paul
and said, "Okay, you win."

25:29.457 --> 25:30.504
Let's go for it.

25:30.622 --> 25:32.629
We're just gonna
miss you so much.

25:33.775 --> 25:35.822
Oh, Gina, I'm gonna
miss you too.

25:36.533 --> 25:38.392
Well, look, it's not
like we're dying, okay?

25:38.417 --> 25:39.728
We're just relocating.

25:39.848 --> 25:42.559
And we'll be back at least
once a year. Maybe more.

25:49.191 --> 25:50.879
-Hi, Dad.
-Sweetheart.

25:52.485 --> 25:55.422
Yeah, well, sorry your mom
couldn't bring herself to come.

25:55.547 --> 25:57.141
But she sends her love

25:57.219 --> 25:59.922
and we're expecting you at
the house tomorrow afternoon.

26:01.094 --> 26:03.352
-Glad you could make it, Larry.
-Hey, Paul.

26:03.734 --> 26:05.039
What can I get you, Dad?

26:05.136 --> 26:06.269
Um...

26:06.339 --> 26:08.745
Look, why don't I--
here, you guys visit. Um...?

26:08.839 --> 26:10.179
-Beer.
-Yeah.

26:10.218 --> 26:13.062
-Just any beer.
-That's great, okay, comin' up.

26:15.210 --> 26:16.717
I wish Mom weren't
taking it so hard.

26:16.772 --> 26:18.944
Well, you know your mother.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.264
Frankly, I was a little skeptical
about it myself at first.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.140
Say, you remember Jerry Gross?

26:25.554 --> 26:27.499
Well, I called him
the other day.

26:27.524 --> 26:29.476
He and Bev retired down there.

26:29.616 --> 26:32.226
Did the whole shrinking thing
that you kids are doing.

26:32.461 --> 26:35.305
He says they're getting along
just fine, never better.

26:35.657 --> 26:37.149
He says he feels
younger every day

26:37.174 --> 26:40.141
and that a dollar buys a
thousand dollars worth of stuff.

26:40.704 --> 26:43.434
Of course they need that with
all the medication Bev takes.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.583
But, uh... yeah.

26:45.893 --> 26:48.362
You know, I... I see the appeal.

26:48.973 --> 26:51.441
Apparently there's zero crime,
I keep telling your mother.

26:52.428 --> 26:53.397
It's very safe.

26:55.790 --> 26:57.108
Yeah, we worry.

26:58.269 --> 27:02.306
When I was younger and,
and uh, and then I-I lost the...

27:02.331 --> 27:03.299
Hey...

27:04.120 --> 27:06.292
You guys are the ones
getting small, right?

27:08.371 --> 27:10.308
Uh, that's right, my wife and I.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.269
Good for you.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.335
No offense, but um...

27:18.171 --> 27:19.999
do you think
if you're that small

27:20.077 --> 27:22.022
you should still have all the
same rights as the rest of us

27:22.047 --> 27:23.585
normal-sized people?

27:23.725 --> 27:25.350
I mean, like the right to vote?

27:27.717 --> 27:28.717
Why wouldn't we?

27:28.850 --> 27:30.882
Oh, well, jeez, let's see, um...

27:31.279 --> 27:32.623
You don't buy
as many products,

27:32.647 --> 27:34.132
you're not paying
as much sales tax,

27:34.157 --> 27:36.420
some of you aren't even
paying any income tax.

27:36.445 --> 27:37.664
I mean, you're not really

27:37.710 --> 27:39.241
participating in our
economy, are you?

27:39.266 --> 27:40.816
-Hey.
-I mean, in fact you're costin' us

27:40.841 --> 27:42.550
-Hey. Hey!
-money and jobs.

27:42.648 --> 27:43.589
That's enough.

27:44.284 --> 27:45.672
We're just having
a good time here.

27:46.521 --> 27:49.361
Hey, I'm just askin' a simple
academic question, all right?

27:49.394 --> 27:50.487
-You know what, I think you guys
-Hey, Tim, Tim...

27:50.512 --> 27:51.737
should have a quarter
of a vote at most.

27:51.762 --> 27:53.135
-I mean, that's pretty generous.
-Tim.

27:53.237 --> 27:54.143
Take a seat, Tim.

27:54.168 --> 27:55.518
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Why don't you take a walk.

27:55.543 --> 27:56.924
Cool your jets, big guy!

27:57.003 --> 27:59.097
You know what, maybe an
eighth of a vote, if that.

27:59.306 --> 28:01.108
And you could use a
little small, buddy.

28:01.133 --> 28:02.321
Yeah, sit down.

28:04.183 --> 28:04.886
Hey!

28:05.308 --> 28:06.113
Hey!

28:06.441 --> 28:09.699
Can I get a normal-sized beer
for a normal-sized guy?

29:16.577 --> 29:18.616
I keep thinking
I forgot something.

29:55.583 --> 29:57.278
Moving to town, are you?

29:58.614 --> 29:59.560
How's that?

29:59.966 --> 30:02.599
I see you're moving
to Leisureland.

30:02.896 --> 30:05.068
You look like a
nice young couple.

30:06.395 --> 30:07.169
Thanks.

30:07.372 --> 30:08.450
Where you from?

30:08.528 --> 30:09.473
Uh, Omaha.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.239
Spokane.

30:11.833 --> 30:12.793
Nervous?

30:13.903 --> 30:16.614
Yeah, you know, uh,
a little.

30:16.856 --> 30:17.911
Don't be.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.591
It's the best thing
you'll ever do.

30:26.636 --> 30:27.863
With your permission,

30:28.292 --> 30:31.104
I'm going to record your answers
to the following questions.

30:31.784 --> 30:33.042
May I begin the recording?

30:33.597 --> 30:34.722
-Sure.
-Yeah.

30:37.722 --> 30:40.089
Please state your
full legal names.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.808
Audrey Lustig Safranek.

30:43.706 --> 30:45.862
Paul Norris Safranek.

30:46.441 --> 30:49.707
And do you,
Audrey Lustig Safranek,

30:49.886 --> 30:52.878
and you,
Paul Norris Safranek,

30:53.035 --> 30:55.245
understand that,
of your own free will,

30:55.270 --> 30:57.667
you will undergo the
permanent and irreversible

30:57.692 --> 30:59.589
medical procedure
commonly knows as

30:59.614 --> 31:00.980
"downsizing?"

31:01.103 --> 31:02.885
And that following
the procedure,

31:02.963 --> 31:04.682
your bodies will
be approximately

31:04.728 --> 31:08.431
.0364% of their current
mass and volume?

31:08.846 --> 31:09.611
Yeah.

31:09.932 --> 31:11.971
I'm-I'm sorry Paul,
I need a yes or no.

31:12.650 --> 31:13.393
Yes.

31:13.869 --> 31:14.572
Yes.

31:14.728 --> 31:16.283
Great, thank you.

31:16.624 --> 31:20.706
And do you give full consent
to Gateway Medical Services

31:20.777 --> 31:21.886
to administer

31:21.911 --> 31:24.857
the medical procedure commonly
known as “downsizing?”

31:24.966 --> 31:25.527
Yes.

31:25.982 --> 31:26.620
Yes.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.760
And do you understand
that there exists

31:29.785 --> 31:33.182
an approximately one
in 225,000 chance

31:33.207 --> 31:35.040
that the procedure could result

31:35.267 --> 31:39.150
in injury, permanent
disability or death?

31:46.833 --> 31:48.029
-Yes.
-Yes.

31:48.857 --> 31:49.685
Yes.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.500
Safranek? Paul Safranek?

32:06.976 --> 32:07.914
Yes.

32:16.505 --> 32:18.005
It's actually Sa <i>fra</i> nek.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.934
Sa <i>fra</i> nek.
Come with me, sir.

32:20.115 --> 32:21.091
We're together.

32:21.169 --> 32:21.950
Oh.

32:22.048 --> 32:24.821
Someone will escort you to the
women's facility shortly.

32:24.916 --> 32:27.603
You will be separated of
approximately five hours.

32:27.628 --> 32:30.892
Following the procedure, you'll
be reunited in the recovery room.

32:31.831 --> 32:32.627
Okay.

32:35.034 --> 32:36.472
-So this is it, then.
-Yeah.

32:38.011 --> 32:40.214
-I'll see you tonight.
-Yeah.

32:40.948 --> 32:42.261
I'll see you on the other side.

32:46.292 --> 32:47.401
I love you.

32:47.963 --> 32:49.097
And I love you, too.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.492
Okay, let's get you up here.

36:20.773 --> 36:21.881
All clear!

38:18.783 --> 38:20.916
Oi, we got some real
fat one this time.

38:20.976 --> 38:22.640
Hey, how's everybody
doin' today?

38:22.750 --> 38:24.609
Hey, Miss Joyce, doin' good.
How you doin'?

38:24.703 --> 38:27.453
Me, I'm great. Just getting
ready for the weekend.

39:16.373 --> 39:18.545
I see you've decided to join us.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.107
Is this...?

39:20.779 --> 39:21.912
Is it over?

39:22.298 --> 39:23.783
Welcome to Leisureland.

39:23.853 --> 39:25.134
Can you tell me your name?

39:25.283 --> 39:27.846
-It's Paul Safranek.
-Okay, good.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.558
I bet you're hungry.

39:37.484 --> 39:38.570
Oh, my God.

39:39.609 --> 39:40.726
Isn't that cute?

39:41.008 --> 39:42.383
People just love that.

39:42.513 --> 39:44.091
I'll bring you a little
snack in a moment.

39:44.122 --> 39:45.128
Thanks. Um,

39:45.153 --> 39:47.567
I think my wife was supposed
to be here with me.

39:47.638 --> 39:48.497
What's her name?

39:48.599 --> 39:49.529
Audrey Safranek

39:49.771 --> 39:51.099
Let me see.

39:51.179 --> 39:53.521
We do have an Audrey Safranek
scheduled for today

39:53.546 --> 39:55.851
but I don't show her
transferred over yet.

39:55.899 --> 39:58.477
She's probably just held up
in dental. I'll go check.

39:58.727 --> 39:59.828
Thank you.

40:05.553 --> 40:07.521
Mr. Safranek,
you've got a call.

40:07.951 --> 40:09.755
Oh, thank you.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.013
Hello?

40:11.584 --> 40:12.318
<i>Paul?</i>

40:12.404 --> 40:16.083
Oh, Audrey, thank God.
Where are you, honey?

40:16.357 --> 40:18.802
<i>Don't be mad at me.
Please don't be mad.</i>

40:19.177 --> 40:20.708
<i>It's hard enough as it is.</i>

40:21.193 --> 40:23.232
What's hard?
Wait, what are you talkin' about?

40:23.861 --> 40:25.158
<i>Oh, Paul!</i>

40:25.415 --> 40:27.056
<i>They shaved my head.</i>

40:27.470 --> 40:31.251
<i>And then they started shaving
my eyebrows and I just thought,</i>

40:31.876 --> 40:33.368
<i>"What am I doing?"</i>

40:33.858 --> 40:36.538
<i>I can't leave my family.
I can't leave my friends.</i>

40:36.600 --> 40:38.819
<i>-And I'm sorry, Paul, I just can't.</i>
-Where are you?

40:40.838 --> 40:42.424
Are you at the airport?

40:43.681 --> 40:45.127
Don't hate me.

40:45.799 --> 40:47.541
Please don't hate me.

40:47.666 --> 40:50.127
<i>Okay, okay. Take it easy. Just</i>

40:50.210 --> 40:52.287
get in a taxi and come back

40:52.311 --> 40:53.881
and we'll talk about this, okay?

40:53.977 --> 40:57.202
We'll go back to Omaha and we'll
think this through together.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.391
Wait.

41:02.250 --> 41:04.094
You're not leaving me here.

41:05.148 --> 41:06.883
Can't you understand how I feel?

41:06.955 --> 41:08.260
I feel terrible.

41:08.447 --> 41:10.627
I let you down, I feel awful.

41:11.270 --> 41:12.294
But then-

41:12.363 --> 41:13.660
then I realized
I was just doing this

41:13.685 --> 41:15.786
because I w-I was trying
to make you happy and

41:16.723 --> 41:18.520
I should've been thinking
more about myself.

41:19.364 --> 41:20.680
Thinking about yourself?

41:21.048 --> 41:22.466
Thinking about yourself?!

41:22.568 --> 41:24.880
You know, you haven't
even asked me how I am!

41:24.935 --> 41:25.958
<i>Don't yell.</i>

41:26.058 --> 41:27.644
<i>Don't yell at me
or I'll hang up.</i>

41:27.691 --> 41:32.011
Do you have any idea what
I have been through today?

41:32.290 --> 41:35.165
Audrey, if you don't come
back here right now...

41:36.065 --> 41:37.847
And see you all small?

41:38.433 --> 41:40.558
I'm upset enough already.

41:40.878 --> 41:42.089
You're upset?

41:42.862 --> 41:44.073
You're upset?

41:44.174 --> 41:46.963
I'm the one who's
five fucking inches tall!

41:48.283 --> 41:49.533
Well, we're sure sorry to hear

41:49.558 --> 41:51.307
Mrs. Safranek couldn't
make it today.

41:52.072 --> 41:53.114
Sa <i>fra</i> nek.

41:53.567 --> 41:54.435
Sa <i>fra</i> nek.

41:54.460 --> 41:56.927
Well, it's not a half-bad
idea to scout things out

41:56.952 --> 41:58.685
get everything ready for her.

42:05.554 --> 42:07.202
The net blocks a lot of UV rays,

42:07.227 --> 42:09.101
but you still might
wanna put your hat on.

42:09.969 --> 42:11.649
And anytime you
wanna to somewhere,

42:11.695 --> 42:13.711
you just hop in
one of these bad boys.

42:13.788 --> 42:15.889
And if they're in
short supply, well,

42:16.061 --> 42:16.952
you can always share.

42:17.085 --> 42:19.842
It's fun to share. I know, I've
met some super people that way.

42:19.897 --> 42:21.022
Just super.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.447
Yeah, isn't that somethin'?

42:46.050 --> 42:47.339
Over to your right there,

42:47.441 --> 42:50.660
that big, white oval building is
one of our seven Sports Centers.

42:50.714 --> 42:51.690
That's the one that houses

42:51.715 --> 42:54.003
the largest indoor skiing
facility in the world--

42:54.028 --> 42:56.136
you know, relatively speaking.

42:56.248 --> 42:58.116
And over there is Lake Chester...

43:31.271 --> 43:32.373
Look familiar?

43:32.841 --> 43:33.794
The Barrington.

43:33.912 --> 43:35.873
My sister's got one.
She loves it.

43:36.168 --> 43:38.848
Well, sir, here is the uh,
key to your kingdom.

43:39.935 --> 43:41.451
Welcome to the good life.

43:44.232 --> 43:47.170
Oh, they uh, stocked the
kitchen with standard items...

43:47.211 --> 43:49.398
but one thing I should warn
you about is the dairy--

43:49.423 --> 43:50.452
it takes a while
for your stomach

43:50.477 --> 43:51.709
to adjust to the milk
and the cheese,

43:51.734 --> 43:54.204
so go easy on it. Somethin'
about the bacteria.

43:54.274 --> 43:55.993
And be careful about
the hot water.

43:56.050 --> 43:59.081
It's on one central system and
they got that cranked really high.

43:59.144 --> 44:00.808
Surprised they haven't
had a lawsuit yet.

44:00.833 --> 44:02.620
Oh, but you didn't
hear that from me.

44:03.366 --> 44:04.475
Thanks Matt.

44:05.272 --> 44:06.559
You're a nice guy.

44:10.149 --> 44:11.203
And Paul?

44:12.469 --> 44:13.993
Thanks for helping the planet.

45:27.570 --> 45:28.797
Aaah!

45:29.156 --> 45:30.149
Fuck!

45:45.044 --> 45:46.043
Safranek?

45:49.497 --> 45:50.434
That's me.

45:52.673 --> 45:53.548
Okay!

46:09.290 --> 46:10.799
<i>And now from the United States,</i>

46:10.824 --> 46:14.430
<i>where for many years, both the
Department of Homeland Security</i>

46:14.478 --> 46:17.032
<i>and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service</i>

46:17.057 --> 46:19.556
<i>have been warning about
the ease with which</i>

46:19.581 --> 46:20.899
<i>downsized people--</i>

46:20.978 --> 46:23.610
<i>from illegal immigrants
to potential terrorists--</i>

46:23.673 --> 46:25.759
<i>could penetrate U.S. borders.</i>

46:25.798 --> 46:28.282
<i>Last week's discovery
in Eugene, Oregon</i>

46:28.307 --> 46:31.126
<i>provided new evidence
to support that claim.</i>

46:31.158 --> 46:33.330
<i>Brian Fakler brings us up to date.</i>

46:34.337 --> 46:35.991
{\an8}<i>This Target is just one of</i>

46:36.016 --> 46:38.150
{\an8}<i>thousands of big-box
stores around the country</i>

46:38.175 --> 46:40.628
{\an8}<i>that import almost a million
tons of goods weekly,</i>

46:40.653 --> 46:41.987
{\an8}<i>most of it from Asia.</i>

46:42.043 --> 46:45.213
{\an8}<i>Last week, workers here in Eugene
opened a suspicious TV box</i>

46:45.238 --> 46:48.801
{\an8}<i>and discovered 17 downsized
stowaways from Vietnam,</i>

46:48.887 --> 46:50.621
{\an8}<i>14 of them already dead,</i>

46:50.646 --> 46:53.832
{\an8}<i>two more dying hours later
at a local hospital.</i>

46:54.137 --> 46:57.770
{\an8}<i>On Friday, the lone survivor,
a woman named Ngoc Lan Tran,</i>

46:57.795 --> 47:01.137
{\an8}<i>was transferred to a hospital at
Leisureland Estates in New Mexico,</i>

47:01.162 --> 47:04.457
{\an8}<i>widely considered the country's
top medical center for the small.</i>

47:04.535 --> 47:07.652
<i>Doctors were forced to amputate
a portion of an infected leg,</i>

47:07.677 --> 47:10.783
<i>and today her condition
is described as fair but stable.</i>

47:10.847 --> 47:13.785
<i>According to a statement from the
Department of Homeland Security,</i>

47:13.869 --> 47:15.439
<i>Ms. Tran claims to
have been jailed</i>

47:15.464 --> 47:17.885
<i>for her political and
environmental activism,</i>

47:17.917 --> 47:19.728
<i>and was miniaturized
against her will</i>

47:19.753 --> 47:21.533
<i>in a Vietnamese prison facility.</i>

47:21.613 --> 47:24.565
<i>If true, this would bolster
claims by human rights groups</i>

47:24.613 --> 47:26.917
<i>that repressive governments
around the world...</i>

47:38.225 --> 47:40.968
So, do we need to review any of
the terms of the settlement?

47:41.162 --> 47:42.099
No.

47:42.354 --> 47:44.311
It's all pretty clear.

47:44.699 --> 47:47.027
I really wish you'd
taken her first offer.

47:47.659 --> 47:48.628
I know.

47:48.747 --> 47:49.731
All right, well.

47:49.973 --> 47:52.598
Just step back a little.
Don't want you to get hurt.

48:10.381 --> 48:11.295
Um.

48:11.842 --> 48:13.427
As large as you can, please.

48:19.613 --> 48:20.878
Nice weather down here.

48:22.331 --> 48:24.191
Turned real cold back in Omaha.

48:24.879 --> 48:25.722
Uh-huh.

48:26.613 --> 48:27.574
Wind chill.

49:13.743 --> 49:14.734
Hey, Paul.

49:15.087 --> 49:16.452
Thanks, man, you were right.

49:16.477 --> 49:18.329
Raising my monitor
really did the trick.

49:18.472 --> 49:20.815
My neck feels better, there's
no more tingling in my arm.

49:21.003 --> 49:22.511
I would've never
made the connection.

49:22.536 --> 49:24.574
That's great, I'm really
glad I could help.

49:28.461 --> 49:29.695
Thank you for
calling Land's End.

49:29.727 --> 49:31.952
My name is Paul,
how can I help you today?

49:55.252 --> 49:56.651
Ciao, bello.

49:57.596 --> 49:58.862
Hi, Carol.

50:12.682 --> 50:13.721
Hey, pal.

50:14.143 --> 50:16.056
Why the long face? Huh?

50:16.463 --> 50:18.487
Look around you, buddy.
Life is good.

50:19.643 --> 50:21.502
I made a mistake, Dave.

50:22.033 --> 50:24.869
Biggest mistake of my life.
Should've stayed where I was.

50:24.894 --> 50:26.510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

50:26.612 --> 50:29.588
Look, I know divorce can put a
dent in anyone's self-esteem.

50:29.822 --> 50:32.260
And what Audrey did to you
was beyond the pale.

50:32.502 --> 50:33.447
I mean, I hate her.

50:33.643 --> 50:35.096
I-I barely know her.

50:35.244 --> 50:37.455
You may not hate her,
but I hate her guts.

50:38.127 --> 50:40.166
You, you just gotta get back
in the saddle, that's all.

50:40.454 --> 50:42.361
Ah, maybe someday.

50:42.926 --> 50:44.301
If you want my advice,

50:44.669 --> 50:46.356
single moms is the way to go.

50:47.115 --> 50:49.114
Yeah, they got the whole kid
thing out of their system,

50:49.139 --> 50:50.295
and they just wanna party

50:50.358 --> 50:51.365
No, that's okay, I'm--

50:51.390 --> 50:53.006
And if you don't want an
emotional connection, which

50:53.172 --> 50:54.953
understandable, you just uh

50:55.022 --> 50:57.787
well, we have all sorts of ways you
can have a good time down here.

50:57.819 --> 50:59.100
No strings attached.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.476
-Just put it on the old credit card.
-No, I'm good.

51:01.624 --> 51:03.187
-Really.
-Okay, yeah.

51:03.366 --> 51:05.459
In fact, I started
seeing someone.

51:05.764 --> 51:06.733
Oh, yeah?

51:07.498 --> 51:09.037
Single mom, actually.

51:09.790 --> 51:12.360
Mm-hmm, now we're talkin'.
Good for you.

51:20.333 --> 51:21.927
Paul, this is so good.

51:22.349 --> 51:23.294
Thanks.

51:25.612 --> 51:27.612
The recipe called
for chervil, but

51:27.853 --> 51:29.417
you can't get chervil here yet.

51:29.503 --> 51:31.542
-So, I used dill.
-Hm.

51:32.492 --> 51:34.797
Well, whatever it is,
it's super-yummy.

51:36.809 --> 51:38.403
It's the little things, you know?

51:38.809 --> 51:42.207
I mean, except for there being
no birds or insects,

51:42.271 --> 51:43.590
you'd think you're
in the normal world

51:43.615 --> 51:44.981
and then somethin' happens

51:45.138 --> 51:46.646
and you realize we're not.

51:46.731 --> 51:48.707
I mean, not that substituting
dill for chervil

51:48.732 --> 51:50.864
is that big a thing, but
you know what I mean.

51:51.133 --> 51:52.399
Like last month,

51:52.484 --> 51:54.624
my parents came down
to visit Jonah and me--

51:54.649 --> 51:55.524
Mm-hmm.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.321
and it's like this whole production

51:57.352 --> 52:00.266
with the carrying boxes, and of
course Jonah gets freaked out

52:00.291 --> 52:02.445
by Grandma and Grandpa
being so huge and scary.

52:02.516 --> 52:03.352
Mm.

52:03.471 --> 52:05.814
One night they took us out
for dinner at Fleming's,

52:05.913 --> 52:07.413
-you know, real nice,
-Mm-hmm.

52:07.647 --> 52:10.788
and Jonah and are
sitting on the table

52:10.813 --> 52:12.283
in those special seats.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.979
And the big people wouldn't
stop staring at us.

52:15.537 --> 52:18.373
Plus, the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome,

52:18.412 --> 52:20.279
and then they charge
a huge minimum.

52:20.389 --> 52:21.750
They should charge
big people extra.

52:21.783 --> 52:23.436
They're the ones
dragging down the world.

52:23.524 --> 52:24.352
I know.

52:24.454 --> 52:26.102
Big people look at us
like we're freaks.

52:26.141 --> 52:27.571
They're the freaks.

52:28.008 --> 52:31.031
Oh, did you hear about all that
gas being released in Antarctica?

52:31.056 --> 52:33.094
From the ice? The methane?

52:33.204 --> 52:35.759
Oh, I haven't really been following
the news that much lately.

52:35.978 --> 52:37.446
Apparently it's a big deal.

52:37.633 --> 52:39.781
Scientists are saying
the more the ice melts,

52:39.806 --> 52:42.633
the more methane comes out
making more ice melt.

52:42.961 --> 52:45.477
Apparently we're already
way beyond the tipping--

52:49.130 --> 52:50.560
It's my upstairs neighbor.

52:51.059 --> 52:53.778
Well, it's the strangest thing,
I-there wasn't a peep for months

52:53.803 --> 52:55.052
I don't even think he was here--

52:55.077 --> 52:57.285
and then suddenly, it's

52:57.310 --> 52:58.770
party, party, party.

52:58.795 --> 53:00.441
I had to call security
the other night.

53:08.803 --> 53:09.717
Dusan!

53:11.207 --> 53:12.535
Hey, Dusan!

53:13.512 --> 53:14.441
Dusan!

53:15.184 --> 53:16.074
Yes?

53:16.249 --> 53:17.648
You mind turning
 down the music?

53:17.673 --> 53:20.390
I'm trying to have a
quiet evening down here.

53:23.374 --> 53:24.984
Hello, my friend.

53:25.281 --> 53:26.648
Hello, Dusan.

53:27.085 --> 53:28.273
May I come in?

53:29.492 --> 53:30.320
Certainly.

53:34.541 --> 53:36.682
So, listen, Pete,

53:36.963 --> 53:37.940
Paul.

53:38.947 --> 53:40.032
-Paul.
-Paul.

53:40.057 --> 53:41.057
And Kristen.

53:41.082 --> 53:43.604
-Ah, hello, Kristen.
-Hi.

53:43.747 --> 53:47.177
I'm sorry I'm disturbing
your nice little dinner.

53:48.263 --> 53:49.279
Listen...

53:49.498 --> 53:51.607
as I was saying, Paul,

53:51.942 --> 53:54.028
I'm having one more, you know,

53:54.075 --> 53:55.841
little party at
my place tonight.

53:55.866 --> 53:58.018
Not big like last time.
Very small.

53:58.096 --> 54:00.088
Just a few close friends.

54:01.061 --> 54:02.014
No!

54:02.428 --> 54:04.303
Is that a rose?

54:04.592 --> 54:06.569
-Yeah.
-A real rose?

54:08.004 --> 54:09.886
Where'd you get a real rose?

54:10.800 --> 54:13.832
It's a new store, uh,
Full-Sized Flower Mart.

54:14.824 --> 54:16.449
How much they're
charging for this?

54:17.051 --> 54:17.996
Dusan!

54:18.652 --> 54:19.754
Dusan!

54:23.103 --> 54:24.657
Quoi, ma Cherie?

54:24.759 --> 54:26.275
<i>What are you doing down there?</i>

54:30.891 --> 54:32.375
Oui, ma Cherie. J'arrive.

54:34.507 --> 54:35.374
Anyway,

54:36.413 --> 54:37.491
as I was saying,

54:37.819 --> 54:40.257
Paul, if tonight
noise disturbs you,

54:40.282 --> 54:41.628
just come upstairs talk to me.

54:41.653 --> 54:43.495
Don't make big show
like last time,

54:43.574 --> 54:45.082
yelling like crazy man.

54:45.483 --> 54:47.990
We're neighbors.
Neighbors are friends.

54:48.069 --> 54:50.475
What's better even,
come to the party.

54:50.628 --> 54:53.261
Thanks, but like I said, we

54:53.339 --> 54:55.073
just want to have
a quiet dinner.

54:55.440 --> 54:57.698
Just try to keep it down, okay?

54:58.797 --> 55:00.492
Yes, darling, of course.

55:00.571 --> 55:01.312
Shh, shh.

55:01.732 --> 55:02.426
Shh.

55:07.770 --> 55:08.567
Oh.

55:08.825 --> 55:10.864
Thanks for a really nice time.

55:11.528 --> 55:12.981
Plus the cooking and all.

55:13.188 --> 55:15.655
Sorry I have to leave so early,
but you know, the sitter...

55:15.680 --> 55:17.594
Yeah, yeah. No...

55:18.344 --> 55:19.337
I was...

55:23.213 --> 55:24.609
Up one floor.

55:24.641 --> 55:25.281
<i>What?</i>

55:25.306 --> 55:26.123
Yeah, one more.

55:26.148 --> 55:27.601
-Gracias
-Oh, gracias, tio.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.761
Anyway, uh,

55:34.816 --> 55:37.886
I was hoping uh, Sunday
we could bring Jonah.

55:38.512 --> 55:40.340
I... I'd love to meet him.

55:40.442 --> 55:42.231
Yeah...maybe.

55:58.123 --> 55:59.889
-Something wrong?
-No.

56:01.717 --> 56:03.725
You're a wonderful guy, Paul.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.264
And I really enjoy
hanging out with you.

56:07.623 --> 56:08.592
Uh-huh.

56:08.685 --> 56:10.857
But, if I'm honest
about how I'm feeling,

56:10.912 --> 56:14.091
I just-it might be uh--
it might be too soon for me.

56:14.116 --> 56:15.272
It's fine, I get it.

56:15.304 --> 56:16.716
-No, no...
-I get it. No, it's fine.

56:16.740 --> 56:19.467
I just mean if we're
bringing Jonah into it...

56:19.847 --> 56:21.175
Have a nice night.

56:21.425 --> 56:22.496
No, I...

56:23.058 --> 56:24.113
Paul!

56:48.647 --> 56:49.811
A rose!

57:09.691 --> 57:10.761
Paul!

57:12.656 --> 57:13.789
You come.

57:14.496 --> 57:16.387
And you bring the rose.

57:16.417 --> 57:18.800
-It's a peace offering.
-Oh.

57:19.260 --> 57:20.533
Look, everyone.

57:20.604 --> 57:22.377
This is Paul, my neighbor.

57:22.402 --> 57:23.815
And look at what he brings me.

57:23.924 --> 57:25.674
A real fucking rose!

57:27.056 --> 57:29.806
You think any of these other
ungrateful sons of bitches

57:29.831 --> 57:31.673
think to bring
something to Dusan?

57:31.720 --> 57:33.321
No. You're the only one.

57:33.392 --> 57:34.446
I like you.

57:35.968 --> 57:39.054
But, I know I said
it's only little party,

57:39.079 --> 57:41.351
but I make two, three phone
calls to very close friends,

57:41.376 --> 57:42.492
look what happens.

57:42.517 --> 57:43.731
Everybody comes.

57:43.756 --> 57:47.708
There's nothing else to do in this
fucking city after 10 o'clock.

57:47.747 --> 57:50.450
Now, this I do not understand.

57:50.911 --> 57:54.020
It's not as if so many people
have work in the morning.

57:54.054 --> 57:56.710
You know, this is worst trait
about small people--

57:56.904 --> 57:58.256
they're lazy.

57:58.335 --> 58:00.819
Not all, not all. But lazy.

58:00.889 --> 58:04.147
Like...this lazy son of a bitch.

58:04.683 --> 58:05.785
Konrad!

58:06.402 --> 58:08.363
What's that you're
saying about me?

58:08.542 --> 58:10.035
What lies are you telling?

58:10.404 --> 58:12.779
Just that in small world
no one wants to work.

58:12.804 --> 58:14.029
What did you expect?

58:14.185 --> 58:16.911
It's the wonderful thing
about becoming small.

58:17.165 --> 58:18.697
Because you're immediately rich.

58:18.931 --> 58:20.626
Unless you're very poor.

58:20.837 --> 58:22.924
Then you're just small.

58:23.854 --> 58:25.400
Konrad's a sea captain.

58:25.575 --> 58:26.442
Oh?

58:26.505 --> 58:29.099
Never more than ten meters
away from his boat.

58:29.155 --> 58:29.944
Oh.

58:30.061 --> 58:31.896
I do like my boat.

58:33.405 --> 58:34.772
There she is.

58:35.029 --> 58:36.944
Sonja, my beauty.

58:37.238 --> 58:41.295
You see, I'm from
many generations.

58:41.373 --> 58:44.428
All the way back to my
grandfathers, my father--

58:44.453 --> 58:45.725
all sea captains.

58:46.897 --> 58:49.279
So, what brings you
to Leisureland?

58:49.357 --> 58:50.428
Dusan.

58:50.589 --> 58:53.128
He even convinced
me to become small,

58:53.245 --> 58:56.948
mostly for the women
and the parties.

58:57.134 --> 59:01.009
And, frankly, my wife
had all the money,

59:01.098 --> 59:04.021
and after she left,
things became a bit tricky.

59:04.121 --> 59:05.825
Oh, I can relate.

59:06.322 --> 59:09.822
It's quite wonderful
to be small, don't you think?

59:10.687 --> 59:13.275
I'd say it has its
pluses and minuses.

59:13.539 --> 59:15.750
Next week I'll be
in the Seychelles,

59:15.955 --> 59:18.070
and two weeks after that, I'll be

59:18.104 --> 59:21.237
sailing with friends for a
month on Lake Titicaca.

59:21.425 --> 59:24.659
Can you believe I've never
been to Lake Titicaca?

59:24.883 --> 59:27.399
Well, how does the boat
get from place to place?

59:27.430 --> 59:28.915
I mean, you can't sail it.

59:29.180 --> 59:31.180
FedEx, my dear boy.

59:31.616 --> 59:34.225
Sonja travels faster than I do.

59:54.292 --> 59:56.448
How'd you get a tiny
harpsichord down here?

59:56.854 --> 59:58.683
Well, I didn't--I had
to have it raised.

59:58.784 --> 59:59.636
Well, how?

01:00:05.023 --> 01:00:07.085
Excuse me, who is that?

01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:08.913
-Who's that?
-Yeah.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.796
That's little Ronni.

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:12.478
That's little Ronni?

01:00:12.728 --> 01:00:14.422
-The first small baby ever born.
-Yeah.

01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:15.657
-Back in Norway?
-Shit.

01:00:15.682 --> 01:00:17.118
-That's little Ronni.
-Yeah.

01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:18.970
You should go talk to him.

01:00:24.297 --> 01:00:25.618
Sorry, uh...

01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:27.274
Sorry, excuse me, um,

01:00:27.366 --> 01:00:29.600
is it-is it true you're little Ronni?

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:31.842
Well, maybe not
so little anymore.

01:00:31.913 --> 01:00:33.288
But yeah, it's me.

01:00:33.486 --> 01:00:34.501
Wow, that's...!

01:00:34.563 --> 01:00:36.368
Do you thi-hey-would it be
cool to get a selfie?

01:00:36.393 --> 01:00:37.727
-Yeah, man, get in here.
-Awesome.

01:00:37.783 --> 01:00:39.595
Thank you so much,
I really appreciate it.

01:00:39.962 --> 01:00:40.892
Thank you.

01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:42.248
-Get in here.
-Wow.

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.454
Thank you, so are you.

01:01:44.097 --> 01:01:45.175
What is that?

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:54.075
No, I need to know.
I-I have allergies.

01:01:58.792 --> 01:01:59.987
Wait! Wait.

01:02:03.332 --> 01:02:04.269
Okay.

01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:19.715
Having fun?

01:04:57.817 --> 01:05:01.372
Enough with the
fucking doorbell.

01:05:03.277 --> 01:05:06.504
Good morning, Mr. Dusan.
We come clean for you.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.181
So you had fun last night, yeah?

01:05:30.939 --> 01:05:32.650
You didn't know were so lucky

01:05:32.675 --> 01:05:35.072
to have exciting
neighbor such as me.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:37.642
Well, I've never been
to a party like that.

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.558
I've nev-there were
so many Europeans.

01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:41.765
Did you know little Ronni
was here? I mean...

01:05:41.937 --> 01:05:45.003
-he is historic.
-And boring, you know.

01:05:45.027 --> 01:05:46.564
Good-looking dumb
Norwegian guy

01:05:46.598 --> 01:05:49.082
goes around the world
having sex with everyone--

01:05:49.107 --> 01:05:53.102
women, men, hermaphrodites,
dogs, goats, monkeys.

01:05:53.644 --> 01:05:56.261
He'll be the first small
baby to die of syphilis,

01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:58.956
but... historic.

01:05:59.535 --> 01:06:02.192
Well, apparently he still lives
in the original colony, you know,

01:06:02.217 --> 01:06:04.700
over in Norway. I've always
wanted to see that.

01:06:04.872 --> 01:06:06.075
It's all right.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.368
You've been there?

01:06:08.712 --> 01:06:11.094
Yeah, I go once or twice a year.

01:06:11.321 --> 01:06:13.813
Konrad too. We make
business there.

01:06:13.938 --> 01:06:15.821
Very good business.

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.280
Must be somethin' to see. I--

01:06:17.382 --> 01:06:19.437
You know, you can't even
get pictures of it online?

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:21.015
Yes, my friend.

01:06:21.696 --> 01:06:24.250
The world is filled
with things to see.

01:06:25.208 --> 01:06:26.911
You know, I don't know you, Paul

01:06:26.974 --> 01:06:28.763
but I like you,
I like you very much.

01:06:28.865 --> 01:06:30.255
And my advice is

01:06:30.404 --> 01:06:33.896
get out of this disgusting
little fucking apartment

01:06:33.929 --> 01:06:35.545
and open your eyes.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:37.303
Don't be so American.

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.120
You're nice guy, Paul,

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.324
but little bit pathetic guy.

01:06:41.483 --> 01:06:43.701
Last night you dance,
 you laugh

01:06:43.726 --> 01:06:45.593
but inside you cry.

01:06:47.746 --> 01:06:49.457
Who are you to talk
to me that way?

01:06:50.925 --> 01:06:52.855
I'm Dusan Mirkovic,
your neighbor.

01:06:52.895 --> 01:06:54.011
Neighbors are friends.

01:06:54.036 --> 01:06:55.550
Friends tell friends the truth.

01:06:57.095 --> 01:06:59.524
Okay, maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit asshole,

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.384
but the world needs assholes.

01:07:01.409 --> 01:07:03.175
Otherwise where
would shit go out.

01:07:05.204 --> 01:07:06.063
Dusan...

01:07:06.157 --> 01:07:08.142
-Bye.
-Thank you.

01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:15.515
When I think of big
people becoming small

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.336
-Mm-mm.
-all the new small cities

01:07:17.361 --> 01:07:19.712
in the world, I see opportunity.

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:22.498
I ask myself, Dusan,

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.169
why the people they
want to become small?

01:07:25.318 --> 01:07:26.701
To help the environment?

01:07:26.779 --> 01:07:28.115
Please.

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:30.491
The become small
to have the things

01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:32.398
which until now were
only for the rich,

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:35.202
which, by the way, is the
genius of the concept.

01:07:35.727 --> 01:07:39.984
So I say to my brother Srdjan--
I work with my brother.

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:41.519
He's still big.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.425
My wife, too, by the way.

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:44.747
I say,

01:07:44.896 --> 01:07:47.786
why not bring very special items,

01:07:47.811 --> 01:07:50.513
luxury items, to the
small consumer?

01:07:50.553 --> 01:07:54.342
The-The things that nobody
else is thinking to bring?

01:07:54.926 --> 01:07:55.941
Such as?

01:07:56.332 --> 01:07:59.230
Well, Cohiba Esplendido.

01:07:59.269 --> 01:08:01.519
Cuba. Best cigar in the world.

01:08:01.652 --> 01:08:03.754
How much you pay for this
when you big?

01:08:03.926 --> 01:08:05.871
Forty-five, fifty dollars.

01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:08.240
When you small,
I sell you this cigar

01:08:08.302 --> 01:08:09.779
for one dollar.

01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:14.416
And from this one Cohiba,
we make about 2,000 cigars.

01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:18.046
Okay, maybe they're not
actually made in Cuba.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:21.395
Maybe they're rolled by
little Albanians in Bujanovac

01:08:21.421 --> 01:08:22.483
but who cares?

01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:24.233
And this is just one thing.

01:08:24.344 --> 01:08:29.249
There's perfume, cologne,
brandy, port, Calvados,

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:31.288
truffles, caviar, pfft.

01:08:31.383 --> 01:08:32.812
Is all that legal?

01:08:33.406 --> 01:08:36.413
Baby, this is Wild West.

01:08:36.902 --> 01:08:38.721
Who has time
chasing after some

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:41.300
fucking Serbian guy
five inches tall

01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:43.348
over a few cigars
and some wine.

01:08:44.134 --> 01:08:47.469
My brother and I are
now in seven small cities

01:08:47.493 --> 01:08:50.188
around the world.
Seven.

01:08:50.305 --> 01:08:54.166
And Paul, listen, anything
you want, I can get for you.

01:08:54.191 --> 01:08:55.602
Anything, anytime.

01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:56.901
Excuse me a minute.

01:09:11.202 --> 01:09:12.249
Hello?

01:09:15.662 --> 01:09:17.108
Uh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:09:20.562 --> 01:09:23.069
Na-pro-shien. What this do?

01:09:30.965 --> 01:09:34.778
Uh, Naproxen.
I-It's a anti-inflammatory.

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:36.723
It's for pain and swelling.

01:09:41.317 --> 01:09:43.504
And this one, what this one do?

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:47.200
Uh, well, Vicodin. That's
also a pain killer,

01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:50.669
but...you wanna be really
careful with that one.

01:09:50.889 --> 01:09:53.108
Pain killer? Pain killer good.

01:09:53.194 --> 01:09:56.366
Listen, I-- this is not
my apartment and, uh,

01:09:56.475 --> 01:09:58.881
you know, I'm sure you're
probably in a lot of pain, but

01:09:58.952 --> 01:10:00.960
y-you shouldn't steal pills.

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.612
I no steal.

01:10:02.706 --> 01:10:04.253
They too old, no good.

01:10:04.278 --> 01:10:07.253
Mr. Dusan, he say me okay
I take away things.

01:10:07.402 --> 01:10:09.206
Pill for sick friend.

01:10:16.936 --> 01:10:20.155
Okay, I finish now.
Bathroom clean.

01:10:23.214 --> 01:10:25.285
Well, whatever's wrong
with your friend,

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.308
I can see that you have a really,
really bad prosthetic foot

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.636
and I'm sure it's causing you
pain in your right hip and knee,

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:33.027
probably your other knee,
your lower-back.

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.574
How you know this thing?

01:10:36.269 --> 01:10:37.418
You doctor?

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.572
Occupational therapist.

01:10:40.932 --> 01:10:41.822
Wait a minute.

01:10:42.299 --> 01:10:43.533
I-I know you.

01:10:45.056 --> 01:10:46.697
You're the--oh, my God.

01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:48.986
You're that woman from
a couple of years ago,

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:49.916
the dissident.

01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:52.470
From Thailand or something?
What's your name?

01:10:53.231 --> 01:10:55.285
Tran Ngoc Lan. Vietnam.

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.638
Tran Ngoc Lan from Vietnam.

01:10:57.716 --> 01:10:59.021
Yes! that's right.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.833
that's--and I
remember that you-you

01:11:00.858 --> 01:11:02.146
lost your leg below the knee.

01:11:02.255 --> 01:11:04.099
that's-that-
that's you!

01:11:04.654 --> 01:11:05.521
Wow!

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:10.485
Uh, Dusan!

01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:13.344
Hey! Do you know
who this is here?

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:15.493
Of course, the famous
Ngoc Lan Tran.

01:11:15.624 --> 01:11:17.631
Dramatic escape from
Vietnamese prison,

01:11:17.656 --> 01:11:20.749
almost died, so now,
she can clean my house.

01:11:21.497 --> 01:11:24.708
America, big land of opportunity.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.396
Push up, push again.
Push, push, push.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:34.616
Okay, that's--now take your
heel back towards you.

01:11:35.114 --> 01:11:36.474
Even harder if you can.

01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:38.427
Even--yeah.

01:11:38.999 --> 01:11:39.788
Yeah.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.648
You-you put your hand
right here, now--

01:11:41.733 --> 01:11:43.741
Feel that. Okay. See
that crunching?

01:11:43.815 --> 01:11:45.628
You hear it?
Yeah, that's arthritis.

01:11:45.729 --> 01:11:48.120
That's already...pretty bad.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.378
Paul,

01:11:49.789 --> 01:11:51.336
you're full of surprises.

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:55.078
You can do this but you work
shit job answering phones?

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:56.672
Well, when I moved down here,
I didn't think I'd be working

01:11:56.697 --> 01:11:58.523
so I let my license expire and...

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:00.391
now, I'd have to get it
in a whole 'nother state.

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.625
It's a whole...it's a boring story.

01:12:05.003 --> 01:12:06.660
I hate to say it, but...

01:12:06.761 --> 01:12:08.104
if you don't do
something pretty soon,

01:12:08.129 --> 01:12:09.503
you're gonna need a new knee.

01:12:09.712 --> 01:12:11.141
Maybe even a new hip.

01:12:11.399 --> 01:12:13.157
You gotta go to a specialist
as soon as you can

01:12:13.182 --> 01:12:14.915
a-and get a whole new foot.

01:12:15.032 --> 01:12:16.282
In the meantime,

01:12:16.325 --> 01:12:18.646
I could make some adjustments
on the existing prosthetic.

01:12:18.671 --> 01:12:21.224
And maybe give you some
pointers on how to walk better.

01:12:21.327 --> 01:12:22.943
I just hate to see you
needlessly suffer

01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:24.396
after all you've been through.

01:12:24.451 --> 01:12:26.991
Okay. I finish work
you come with me.

01:12:27.455 --> 01:12:29.736
Yeah, no, I can get my tools,
I can do it right here.

01:12:29.775 --> 01:12:33.080
No. I say you before my
friend sick, need pill.

01:12:33.177 --> 01:12:35.599
You come with me my house.
Help her.

01:12:35.716 --> 01:12:37.122
You help her.

01:12:37.616 --> 01:12:41.202
I...I don't think I was clear.
I can help you with this

01:12:41.235 --> 01:12:43.030
but I'm not a doctor, so

01:12:43.055 --> 01:12:44.164
your friend, whatever's
wrong with her,

01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:45.597
she's gotta go to a
clinic or a hospital...

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:47.180
No! Clinic no good.

01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:49.041
I bring her clinic
wait too long time.

01:12:49.066 --> 01:12:52.369
Stupid doctor say no help
for her, no do nothing.

01:12:52.473 --> 01:12:56.160
He no good stupid doctor in
big world, now he small.

01:12:56.708 --> 01:12:57.792
You come with me.

01:12:58.701 --> 01:13:00.194
You come with me now.

01:13:01.038 --> 01:13:01.717
Uh.

01:13:04.521 --> 01:13:05.537
Come.

01:13:23.305 --> 01:13:24.446
You live near here?

01:13:24.727 --> 01:13:26.188
No, still far.

01:13:27.473 --> 01:13:29.238
Maybe we should grab a car.

01:13:30.191 --> 01:13:31.965
No need car. Take bus.

01:13:45.336 --> 01:13:47.188
If-If you don't mind my asking,

01:13:47.234 --> 01:13:49.265
you were so famous a
couple of years ago,

01:13:49.298 --> 01:13:51.180
I mean, everybody was
talking about you.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:53.012
I just would've thought
you'd have been

He stupid!

01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:04.643
<i>Hola, Señor Cárdenas.</i>

01:26:04.916 --> 01:26:06.150

<i>Ay, sí, chinita. Gracias.</i>

01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:13.234
<i>God will repay you.</i>

01:26:13.499 --> 01:26:15.140
<i>How's your lung?</i>

01:26:15.866 --> 01:26:17.671
<i>How's your lung?</i>

01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:20.333

Okay, over here, this way.

<i>Mucho dolor, verdad?</i>

<i>Yes, it hurts a lot.</i>

01:26:34.434 --> 01:26:35.880
Oh, it looks really painful.

01:26:35.905 --> 01:26:37.805
<i>I give him baths and scrub him</i>

01:26:37.939 --> 01:26:41.173
<i> and put herbs,
but nothing helps.</i>

01:26:41.328 --> 01:26:44.127
I bet that's ringworm

01:26:44.152 --> 01:26:45.635
which I don't know
how to say in Spanish.

01:26:45.674 --> 01:26:48.346
But ringworm is a fungus, so

01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:49.721
you want it dry.

01:26:49.776 --> 01:26:53.096
<i>Seco. Seco. No baño.
No baño. No agua. No agua.</i>

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.096
And uh...

01:26:54.157 --> 01:26:55.643
see if I can pick something
up at the drugstore

01:26:55.668 --> 01:26:56.885

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:58.048
Yes, you bring.

01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.629
<i>Mañana medicina.</i>

<i>-Gracias.</i>

01:27:15.728 --> 01:27:17.595
So that's it?
We go home now?

01:27:17.736 --> 01:27:19.853
Now we go church pray Jesus.

01:27:49.944 --> 01:27:52.537
You come back tomorrow
pick me up eight o'clock.

01:27:52.562 --> 01:27:54.406
Yeah, okay, I'll be here.

01:28:04.292 --> 01:28:07.302
Good morning, Mr. Dusan.
We come clean for you.

01:28:27.809 --> 01:28:31.004
Answering telephones was not
dignified enough for you.

01:28:31.029 --> 01:28:33.403
Now you progress
to cleaning toilets.

01:28:33.504 --> 01:28:35.121
I love you, Paul.

01:28:35.442 --> 01:28:38.426
I really love you.
You're such a funny guy.

01:28:38.461 --> 01:28:39.711
Hilarious.

01:28:39.929 --> 01:28:41.344
Like I said,

01:28:41.369 --> 01:28:43.624
you're too much nice guy

01:28:43.812 --> 01:28:46.511
and a little bit...pathetic guy.

01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:48.269
It's just until
she gets a new foot.

01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:49.981
-When will that be.
-I don't know.

01:28:50.046 --> 01:28:52.343
The doctor said a month,
maybe six weeks.

01:28:52.368 --> 01:28:54.531
-Ah, that's an eternity.
-I know.

01:28:54.784 --> 01:28:56.620
Meantime she's stuck
with a peg leg,

01:28:56.645 --> 01:28:58.839
which is almost as bad
as having nothing at all.

01:28:58.886 --> 01:28:59.831
I mean, look at her,

01:28:59.878 --> 01:29:02.034
she's waddling around
like a goddamned pirate!

01:29:03.987 --> 01:29:06.362
Paul! You no talk
with Mr. Dusan!

01:29:06.456 --> 01:29:08.206
You go upstairs with Veronica!

01:29:09.197 --> 01:29:11.001
-Paul!
-I heard you.

01:29:11.447 --> 01:29:13.080
Don't worry, Paul.

01:29:15.837 --> 01:29:17.587
Dusan will save you.

01:29:29.398 --> 01:29:30.399
Wow.

01:29:32.254 --> 01:29:34.411
Yeah, Miss Tran,
take everything.

01:29:36.423 --> 01:29:39.501
Mr. Konrad and I are
leaving day after tomorrow

01:29:39.603 --> 01:29:41.743
and don't know when
we'll be back.

01:29:42.555 --> 01:29:44.524
Okay good. Thank you.

01:29:44.641 --> 01:29:46.579
Paul, Mr. Dusan say
I take all the food.

01:29:46.604 --> 01:29:48.133
You go find me big box.

01:29:48.209 --> 01:29:49.505
In a minute.

01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.615
First there's something
very important to discuss.

01:29:54.553 --> 01:29:55.459
Me?

01:29:55.787 --> 01:29:57.826
This is the situation.

01:29:58.147 --> 01:30:00.162
I don't know exactly what,

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:02.263
but something big-- very big-

01:30:02.288 --> 01:30:04.928
is happening at the
original small colony.

01:30:04.953 --> 01:30:06.717
You know, the one in Norway.

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:09.264
They want me to
go there right away

01:30:09.289 --> 01:30:11.545
with a very important delivery.

01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:13.404
It's too complicated to explain.

01:30:13.435 --> 01:30:16.756
Top secret and... very urgent.

01:30:17.051 --> 01:30:21.090
Most important they are
offering us very big money.

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:22.465
Very big.

01:30:22.989 --> 01:30:25.761
That means we need extra help

01:30:25.847 --> 01:30:28.612
to do this quickly,
make them happy.

01:30:28.712 --> 01:30:31.305
And I'm sorry to say, we need
the same excellent helper

01:30:31.330 --> 01:30:33.017
who is currently helping you.

01:30:33.118 --> 01:30:34.087
Him.

01:30:34.699 --> 01:30:36.066
That's right, Ngoc Lan,

01:30:36.152 --> 01:30:38.707
I have to go with
these guys to Norway.

01:30:40.937 --> 01:30:43.601
So... you say...

01:30:43.843 --> 01:30:46.046
Paul go with you Norway?

01:30:46.579 --> 01:30:48.150
That's the situation.

01:30:48.548 --> 01:30:50.158
Emergency situation.

01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:52.275
And deeply humanitarian.

01:30:53.524 --> 01:30:55.297
I mean, Ngoc Lan, I will

01:30:55.438 --> 01:30:58.141
be able to help when I get
back one-hundred-percent

01:30:58.188 --> 01:30:59.782
when the new foot, and--

01:30:59.883 --> 01:31:01.344
You leave Wednesday?

01:31:01.958 --> 01:31:02.865
Yes.

01:31:04.232 --> 01:31:05.701
And how long you go?

01:31:09.408 --> 01:31:11.268
Ten days. Maybe more.

01:31:17.057 --> 01:31:19.057
Okay, yes, Norway.

01:31:19.268 --> 01:31:20.885
I go Norway too.

01:31:21.537 --> 01:31:23.271
No, no, no, not you.

01:31:23.888 --> 01:31:25.177
Only Paul.

01:31:25.521 --> 01:31:26.747
I go Norway too.

01:31:26.818 --> 01:31:28.357
Paul, you help me
on the trip.

01:31:29.808 --> 01:31:31.276
But you're very busy here

01:31:31.301 --> 01:31:33.683
with humanitarian
activities on your own.

01:31:33.823 --> 01:31:35.714
And your cleaning business.

01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:38.801
Veronica and other ladies
know every place.

01:31:38.903 --> 01:31:40.450
They do for me,
I pay them good.

01:31:40.512 --> 01:31:41.895
No problem I go.

01:31:42.509 --> 01:31:45.320
Norway colony people
invite me so many time

01:31:45.345 --> 01:31:46.790
but I never go.

01:31:46.884 --> 01:31:49.048
Feel so, so guilty.

01:31:50.001 --> 01:31:51.876
They so nice people.

01:31:52.637 --> 01:31:53.489
What?

01:31:54.043 --> 01:31:55.536
Who invited you?

01:31:57.143 --> 01:32:00.143
When I hospital so long time
after TV box,

01:32:00.572 --> 01:32:02.838
people all over world

01:32:02.979 --> 01:32:06.369
send me happy card,
flower, candy,

01:32:06.565 --> 01:32:07.916
make me feel good.

01:32:08.518 --> 01:32:10.089
So many letter.

01:32:10.182 --> 01:32:12.667
One letter very special
I never forget.

01:32:13.018 --> 01:32:15.307
From Jorgen Asbjornsen.

01:32:16.892 --> 01:32:19.439
You got a letter from
Jorgen Asbjornsen?

01:32:20.252 --> 01:32:22.330
Dr. Asbjornsen write me

01:32:23.127 --> 01:32:25.502
say he feel so, so bad

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.471
I suffer for his fault.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.181
He say he painful.

01:32:31.284 --> 01:32:34.190
He never think make small
so bad for people.

01:32:35.777 --> 01:32:38.582
Dr. Asbjornsen letter
make me feel so good.

01:32:39.059 --> 01:32:40.762
I write letter too,

01:32:40.863 --> 01:32:44.082
say now first time
I happy be small.

01:32:47.327 --> 01:32:50.281
He say me make trip

01:32:50.984 --> 01:32:52.632
But I too busy.

01:32:53.285 --> 01:32:54.597
Always too busy.

01:32:54.622 --> 01:32:58.512
Now Jesus give me
special gift, go Norway.

01:33:00.757 --> 01:33:04.289
Thank you Mr. Dusan,
thank you Mr. Konrad.

01:33:06.337 --> 01:33:07.165
Yes.

01:33:07.368 --> 01:33:09.220
I go Norway too.

01:33:09.376 --> 01:33:10.704
So happy.

01:33:11.298 --> 01:33:13.493
Thank you special time.

01:35:14.204 --> 01:35:15.407
Paul, look.

01:35:15.782 --> 01:35:19.017
This Jorgen Asbjornsen.
And his wife.

01:35:20.525 --> 01:35:23.001
Oh, my God. Jorgen Asbjornsen.

01:35:24.875 --> 01:35:25.859
Hello.

01:35:26.484 --> 01:35:27.820
This is such an honor.

01:35:27.929 --> 01:35:29.132
I know, I know.

01:35:29.408 --> 01:35:30.455
See, Paul?

01:35:30.916 --> 01:35:32.439
Jesus smile for me.

01:35:32.516 --> 01:35:35.688
I say Paul I want visit
Norway only for meet you.

01:35:36.243 --> 01:35:37.102
It's true.

01:35:37.354 --> 01:35:39.299
-I'm Anne-Helene.
-Hello.

01:35:39.541 --> 01:35:41.033
Please, sit. Join us.

01:35:41.487 --> 01:35:42.698
Thank you.

01:35:42.885 --> 01:35:44.694
We're watching the world go by.

01:35:44.913 --> 01:35:46.007
Sounds great.

01:35:47.132 --> 01:35:48.616
You have no idea how terribly

01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:51.625
grief-stricken we were
by Miss Tran's case.

01:35:52.182 --> 01:35:55.706
Jorgen has lost so much
sleep over all the abuses.

01:36:06.104 --> 01:36:07.846
It's humbling, huh?

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.081
Nature is such
a patient sculptor.

01:36:12.242 --> 01:36:14.242
Grinding a tiny bit

01:36:14.374 --> 01:36:18.359
each day slowly, slowly
for thousands of years to

01:36:18.437 --> 01:36:22.343
make such a supremely
beautiful thing.

01:36:24.909 --> 01:36:26.221
What a waste.

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:31.534
What a dreadful waste.

01:36:41.145 --> 01:36:42.901
You'll have to excuse Jorgen.

01:36:42.926 --> 01:36:46.246
These past few days has
been especially hard.

01:36:46.795 --> 01:36:49.389
Such a big decision to make
and so quickly.

01:36:49.965 --> 01:36:51.926
Normally when
we visit the Colony,

01:36:51.951 --> 01:36:54.525
we like to spend a few
days in Honningsvåg.

01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:56.122
But then the news came...

01:36:57.196 --> 01:37:00.102
and uh, yeah,
well, here we are

01:37:00.336 --> 01:37:02.149
suddenly imposing on you.

01:37:02.329 --> 01:37:04.149
We scarcely had
the time to pack.

01:37:05.558 --> 01:37:07.136
I'm sorry, w-what news?

01:37:08.074 --> 01:37:10.089
Why, the methane release.

01:37:10.214 --> 01:37:12.917
In Antarctica. You must
know about the methane.

01:37:13.771 --> 01:37:14.701
Yeah...

01:37:15.099 --> 01:37:17.709
that's not-that's not
new, is it? I mean--

01:37:18.098 --> 01:37:19.606
New or old,

01:37:20.496 --> 01:37:21.817
it's the end.

01:37:23.226 --> 01:37:25.726
It's the end of everything.

01:37:28.054 --> 01:37:32.319
The world has already seen
five major extinctions,

01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:34.179
and now there will be another.

01:37:34.655 --> 01:37:36.741
I...I didn't want to believe it.

01:37:36.835 --> 01:37:38.327
None of us did, but

01:37:38.507 --> 01:37:42.491
there we were in Helsinki,
big and small.

01:37:42.702 --> 01:37:47.460
Climatologists, bacteriologists,
demographers, physicists,

01:37:47.522 --> 01:37:49.069
immunologists,

01:37:49.286 --> 01:37:52.497
26 Nobel Prize
winners among us.

01:37:53.291 --> 01:37:55.830
We built all the models,
did all the math,

01:37:56.104 --> 01:37:58.799
and all conclusion
was consistent.

01:37:59.756 --> 01:38:02.905
Homo Sapiens will soon
vanish from the Earth.

01:38:04.194 --> 01:38:06.999
It is now an
actuarial certainty.

01:38:08.381 --> 01:38:10.616
No matter how
the end will come--

01:38:10.897 --> 01:38:13.413
environmental disaster,

01:38:13.569 --> 01:38:15.116
pandemic disease,

01:38:15.158 --> 01:38:16.529
unbreathable air,

01:38:16.554 --> 01:38:19.151
impotable water,
not enough food,

01:38:19.252 --> 01:38:23.463
nuclear winter, some
combination of them all.

01:38:24.237 --> 01:38:29.807
Relatively soon the Earth will
indeed purge itself of human life,

01:38:30.699 --> 01:38:33.480
and God knows how
many other species.

01:38:35.035 --> 01:38:37.894
Do you really mean extinction?
What about downsizing?

01:38:38.003 --> 01:38:39.847
Yeah, yeah, too little too late.

01:38:40.011 --> 01:38:43.089
Only three percent of the
world has miniaturized.

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:45.519
There simply isn't enough time.

01:38:49.159 --> 01:38:53.104
Not a very successful
species, these Homo Sapiens,

01:38:53.267 --> 01:38:56.063
even with such great
intelligence.

01:38:56.212 --> 01:38:58.806
Barely 200,000 years.

01:38:59.093 --> 01:39:01.959
Alligator has survived
200 million years

01:39:01.984 --> 01:39:04.741
with a brain
the size of a walnut.

01:39:09.024 --> 01:39:10.976
People have been predicting
the end of the world

01:39:11.001 --> 01:39:12.672
for thousands of years.

01:39:13.852 --> 01:39:15.641
And now it's really happening.

01:39:18.265 --> 01:39:20.640
I guess somebody
had to be right someday.

01:39:22.187 --> 01:39:23.304
So sad.

01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:26.250
Very sad.

01:39:40.652 --> 01:39:42.348
Okay, I go sleep now.

01:39:42.738 --> 01:39:44.019
Good night, Paul.

01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:46.504
Good night, Ngoc Lan.

01:39:49.532 --> 01:39:50.267
Ay.

01:39:51.017 --> 01:39:51.939
You okay?

01:39:52.197 --> 01:39:53.368
I fine.

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.138
You know, maybe I should
take a look at your leg.

01:39:56.404 --> 01:39:58.208
Okay, yes, you look.

01:40:03.005 --> 01:40:04.138
Oh, yup.

01:40:04.818 --> 01:40:05.615
Wow.

01:40:06.622 --> 01:40:09.294
That peg is really
making the skin chafe.

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.184
Okay.

01:40:18.981 --> 01:40:20.137
You know,

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:23.637
if somebody told me
ten years ago

01:40:23.762 --> 01:40:26.075
that one day I'd be
five inches tall,

01:40:26.135 --> 01:40:27.096
divorced,

01:40:27.193 --> 01:40:30.053
helping a famous Vietnamese
dissident get a new foot

01:40:30.115 --> 01:40:32.678
while cruising up
a fjord in Norway

01:40:32.803 --> 01:40:35.748
discussing the end of the
world with Jorgen Asbjornsen,

01:40:36.611 --> 01:40:38.689
I would've said he was crazy.

01:41:14.239 --> 01:41:15.129
I'm sorry.

01:41:15.801 --> 01:41:17.621
I'm sorry. I-I thought--

01:41:18.301 --> 01:41:19.879
Jesus, I'm such an idiot.

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.207
No.

01:41:22.996 --> 01:41:23.879
Please.

01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:25.449
I want.

01:42:02.556 --> 01:42:04.049
Morning.

01:42:06.559 --> 01:42:07.738
Good morning.

01:42:11.447 --> 01:42:12.720
What's that sound?

01:42:13.408 --> 01:42:14.494
A greeting.

01:43:48.456 --> 01:43:49.307
Wow!

01:43:49.425 --> 01:43:52.034
That's it, that's
the original colony.

01:43:52.318 --> 01:43:55.060
Wait, and there's no net?
No walls?

01:43:55.085 --> 01:43:56.546
No, we've been lucky.

01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:59.523
We are too close to the
sea for the mosquitoes.

01:43:59.847 --> 01:44:01.767
And over the years,
we realized

01:44:01.792 --> 01:44:04.573
that the birds, they
preferred the lemmings.

01:44:04.783 --> 01:44:07.174
But yes, this is
where we started

01:44:07.276 --> 01:44:09.049
many years ago.

01:44:44.258 --> 01:44:46.258
Jorgen, good to see you.

01:44:47.172 --> 01:44:48.196
Welcome.

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:50.001
No, no.

01:44:50.071 --> 01:44:51.431
Jorgen!

01:44:51.767 --> 01:44:53.392
Anne-Helene!

01:44:53.615 --> 01:44:55.199
Oh, thank God you're here!

01:44:55.224 --> 01:44:57.888
Why didn't anyone
tell me?

01:44:58.250 --> 01:45:01.515
Oh, I love you so much.

01:45:03.118 --> 01:45:05.204
I love you both so much.

01:45:05.487 --> 01:45:07.634
Oh, ever since the decision,

01:45:07.659 --> 01:45:09.737
I didn't feel right
without you here.

01:45:09.762 --> 01:45:11.825
And you know
how I am when I worry.

01:45:11.850 --> 01:45:13.793
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

01:45:13.818 --> 01:45:16.020
Ask anyone here,
they tell you.

01:45:16.045 --> 01:45:18.196
Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen,

01:45:18.221 --> 01:45:20.439
but we need your
advice immediately.

01:45:20.464 --> 01:45:22.275
Yes. Excuse us, Solveig.

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:25.619
Of course, darling. You've
got important things to do.

01:45:26.773 --> 01:45:29.788
Oh! Dusan, Dusan, Dusan!

01:45:29.882 --> 01:45:32.859
Bless you for coming so quickly.

01:45:35.406 --> 01:45:38.468
Solveig, my darling,
I'm always happy to help

01:45:38.493 --> 01:45:41.336
in difficult times, in easy
times, in happy times.

01:45:41.361 --> 01:45:44.738
Is always a pleasure to come and
visit you and your lovely village.

01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:47.593
Oh, it is lovely, isn't it?

01:45:47.728 --> 01:45:51.040
I can't bear to think
I won't see it again.

01:45:51.494 --> 01:45:54.220
You know, I'm the one
who made this colony

01:45:54.245 --> 01:45:56.204
 possible in the first place.

01:45:56.322 --> 01:45:59.079
I've been coming since
I was just a baby.

01:45:59.275 --> 01:46:01.400
I remember one time--

01:46:02.196 --> 01:46:04.798
Wait. I know you.

01:46:05.235 --> 01:46:07.579
You were in my dream last night.

01:46:08.134 --> 01:46:12.649
You were a horse or a pony--
something very strong.

01:46:12.798 --> 01:46:17.720
And I mounted you and rode you
through a dangerous forest.

01:46:18.688 --> 01:46:21.352
-Okay.
-And here you are.

01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:23.165
Right before we leave.

01:46:23.798 --> 01:46:25.696
Another miracle.

01:46:26.478 --> 01:46:29.041
You are coming with us,
aren't you?

01:46:29.446 --> 01:46:30.883
Where are you going?

01:46:32.563 --> 01:46:33.672
In there.

01:46:34.367 --> 01:46:35.852
Would you like to see?

01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:49.352
Where this go?

01:46:49.844 --> 01:46:51.344
To the vault.

01:46:52.469 --> 01:46:54.063
-The vault?
-Oh, yes.

01:46:54.313 --> 01:46:57.664
We've been working on it almost
since the very beginning.

01:46:58.212 --> 01:47:00.509
When Jorgen made
his big discovery,

01:47:00.556 --> 01:47:03.501
I said, look, Jorgen,
you're a genius,

01:47:03.626 --> 01:47:08.071
and downsizing is a genius idea.
No one is questioning that.

01:47:08.196 --> 01:47:11.806
But what if people
don't accept it?

01:47:11.868 --> 01:47:14.728
What if it doesn't
come out on time?

01:47:15.231 --> 01:47:17.745
Anyway, this is what
they came up with.

01:47:17.770 --> 01:47:19.668
On my suggestion.

01:47:20.143 --> 01:47:24.283
Torvald, be a sweetheart and
give our friends a little tour.

01:47:24.994 --> 01:47:26.244
Well, sure.

01:47:26.799 --> 01:47:28.508
The tunnel leads to a vault

01:47:28.533 --> 01:47:31.807
1.6 kilometers inside
the Earth's lithosphere

01:47:31.856 --> 01:47:35.145
and is encased in a double
layer of Inconel 625.

01:47:35.387 --> 01:47:39.130
In addition to maintaining a
broad spectrum of biodiversity,

01:47:39.286 --> 01:47:42.958
the vault is equipped with
fields for growing foods,

01:47:42.983 --> 01:47:46.755
forests for lumber, livestock
for animal husbandry.

01:47:46.859 --> 01:47:49.763
The residential
areas are spacious

01:47:49.788 --> 01:47:53.421
and easily expandable to provide
for future generations.

01:47:55.005 --> 01:47:57.606
Wait, but that's not
all underground?

01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:58.606
Oh, yes!

01:47:58.653 --> 01:48:01.989
Our new small size
makes it possible.

01:48:02.038 --> 01:48:04.944
Otherwise we never could
have dreamed of preserving

01:48:04.969 --> 01:48:08.637
so much of the world
in a single safe place.

01:48:08.894 --> 01:48:10.434
This is brilliant.

01:48:11.254 --> 01:48:14.567
Isn't this brilliant? It's like-
It's like Noah's Ark.

01:48:14.816 --> 01:48:17.778
Yes. exactly!
It's Noah's Ark!

01:48:17.887 --> 01:48:20.652
So, how-what do you do for
power, is it nuclear?

01:48:20.770 --> 01:48:22.965
No, no, 100% geothermal.

01:48:23.031 --> 01:48:25.265
And we have interoperable
organic systems

01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:27.937
to manage production of
artificial sunlight,

01:48:28.023 --> 01:48:32.125
oxygen, CO2 elimination,
water purification, and so on.

01:48:34.867 --> 01:48:36.961
And how long will you
stay down there?

01:48:37.375 --> 01:48:41.023
Torvald, how long is it?
8,000 years?

01:48:41.101 --> 01:48:42.718
Well, something like that.

01:48:42.773 --> 01:48:45.648
Just until the surface
environment stabilizes.

01:48:48.957 --> 01:48:51.621
It's not unprecedented
what we are doing here.

01:48:52.058 --> 01:48:54.347
Less than a hundred
thousand years ago

01:48:54.472 --> 01:48:56.972
humans underwent
a near-extinction.

01:48:57.433 --> 01:48:59.316
Maybe 2,000 survived.

01:48:59.457 --> 01:49:00.902
And from that handful

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:03.291
came all of the billions
of people you see today.

01:49:03.355 --> 01:49:05.675
Rebooting the species.
It's nothing new.

01:49:05.715 --> 01:49:07.183
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:15.324 --> 01:49:16.543
My friends.

01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.738
Many years ago,

01:49:18.863 --> 01:49:22.004
when we discovered
cellular miniaturization,

01:49:22.169 --> 01:49:24.896
the world which had
seemed so doomed

01:49:24.993 --> 01:49:27.719
felt suddenly so full
of possibilities.

01:49:28.704 --> 01:49:32.867
So, until very recently,
I maintained hope

01:49:32.985 --> 01:49:35.839
that the contingency plan
we embark upon tomorrow

01:49:35.886 --> 01:49:38.285
could remain simply that--

01:49:38.675 --> 01:49:40.136
a plan.

01:49:41.746 --> 01:49:42.875
But...

01:49:43.456 --> 01:49:45.134
history has spoken.

01:49:45.995 --> 01:49:50.237
And this is our final dinner in
the place we've called home

01:49:50.315 --> 01:49:52.151
for so many years.

01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:55.919
Yes, we are sad to leave,

01:49:57.105 --> 01:50:01.090
and terribly sad
for the reasons why.

01:50:02.402 --> 01:50:06.043
But man is too beautiful,

01:50:07.195 --> 01:50:10.044
too improbable a life form

01:50:10.069 --> 01:50:13.812
to be allowed to disappear
forever from the cosmos.

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:17.801
Now then,

01:50:19.215 --> 01:50:22.371
I would like to ask the
surviving members of the

01:50:22.426 --> 01:50:24.801
original colony to stand.

01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:38.985
Ah, look at him.

01:50:39.101 --> 01:50:40.742
Little Ronni.

01:50:40.875 --> 01:50:43.118
How he has grown.

01:50:47.909 --> 01:50:49.878
I ask you again

01:50:50.011 --> 01:50:52.636
as I asked you
so many years ago.

01:50:53.679 --> 01:50:55.531
Generations to come,

01:50:55.711 --> 01:50:58.179
perhaps all of humanity
will thank you

01:50:58.204 --> 01:51:00.422
for your bravery
and commitment.

01:51:00.934 --> 01:51:02.371
But you must ask yourself

01:51:02.396 --> 01:51:05.270
whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world.

01:51:05.551 --> 01:51:07.973
For there will be
no turning back.

01:51:10.082 --> 01:51:11.816
Are you ready?

01:51:12.901 --> 01:51:14.111
<i>I am ready!</i>

01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:15.565
<i>I am ready!</i>

01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:16.897
<i>-I am ready!
-Yes!</i>

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.303
<i>I am ready!</i>

01:51:18.584 --> 01:51:20.202
Is everyone ready?

01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:27.376
We are ready!

01:51:27.688 --> 01:51:28.877
We are ready!

01:51:29.336 --> 01:51:30.554
We are ready!

01:51:30.954 --> 01:51:32.149
We are ready!

01:51:32.759 --> 01:51:33.790
We are ready!

01:51:34.391 --> 01:51:35.477
We are ready!

01:51:36.196 --> 01:51:37.266
We are ready!

01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:38.891
We are ready!

01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:40.703
We are ready!

01:51:41.242 --> 01:51:42.507
We are ready!

01:51:43.025 --> 01:51:44.096
We are ready!

01:52:09.334 --> 01:52:10.404
Paul!

01:52:12.389 --> 01:52:13.279
Yeah.

01:52:13.778 --> 01:52:15.496
Can you come down here?

01:52:20.457 --> 01:52:23.738
Where you go?
I look many place for you.

01:52:25.012 --> 01:52:26.200
I was just here.

01:52:26.645 --> 01:52:29.464
I talk with Mr. Dusan,
he say fat lady pay,

01:52:29.489 --> 01:52:30.770
he ready go back.

01:52:31.057 --> 01:52:32.087
I happy for that.

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:35.596
Too long time away from Señor
Cardenas and Mrs. Lopez.

01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:38.253
Oh, I worry too much for them.

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:40.379
Ngoc Lan, you can't just be

01:52:40.426 --> 01:52:43.707
worried for a few little people
thousands of miles away.

01:52:43.813 --> 01:52:45.876
You have to look at
the big picture.

01:52:46.938 --> 01:52:48.282
Why you say like this?

01:52:48.829 --> 01:52:52.673
Because...Mr. Cardenas
and Mrs. Lopez,

01:52:53.125 --> 01:52:54.852
they don't stand a chance,

01:52:55.493 --> 01:52:56.829
None of us do.

01:52:57.182 --> 01:52:58.432
It's over.

01:53:00.573 --> 01:53:02.104
You want go with them.

01:53:02.534 --> 01:53:04.940
And I want you to come with me.

01:53:06.557 --> 01:53:07.987
You crazy man!

01:53:08.034 --> 01:53:10.995
Always I know you stupid.
Now I see you crazy too.

01:53:11.073 --> 01:53:12.347
How am I crazy?

01:53:12.432 --> 01:53:13.565
You heard them.

01:53:13.628 --> 01:53:16.057
This is the only chance for
the survival of our species--

01:53:16.082 --> 01:53:17.378
that's huge!

01:53:17.403 --> 01:53:18.884
You want to help people?

01:53:18.909 --> 01:53:21.097
These are the people
that you should be helping.

01:53:21.968 --> 01:53:25.109
The future of humanity
is down that hole!

01:53:25.531 --> 01:53:27.195
Who you help down there?

01:53:27.476 --> 01:53:30.578
People here need help,
not down stupid hole!

01:53:32.383 --> 01:53:34.539
Mr. Dusan, Mr. Konrad,

01:53:34.586 --> 01:53:35.945
talk to crazy Paul.

01:53:35.970 --> 01:53:38.492
He want go down hole,
me go with him.

01:53:38.537 --> 01:53:39.693
Paul, Paul, Paul...

01:53:39.834 --> 01:53:42.217
Why do you want to do
such a silly thing?

01:53:42.723 --> 01:53:44.772
Dusan, these people are
actually trying to do something

01:53:44.797 --> 01:53:48.199
to save the human race.
I wanna be a part of that.

01:53:48.255 --> 01:53:49.724
Okay, fine, you want to help

01:53:49.763 --> 01:53:51.998
then do what I did,
give them a semen sample.

01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.279
I did it too.

01:53:53.484 --> 01:53:55.374
A much more
pleasant way to help.

01:53:55.788 --> 01:53:57.468
If I'm not supposed to be
a part of this thing,

01:53:57.507 --> 01:53:59.257
then w-what am I doing here?

01:54:00.438 --> 01:54:02.180
Why didn't I become a doctor?

01:54:02.594 --> 01:54:05.415
Why did I downsize?
Why did my wife abandon me?

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:08.125
Dusan, how did you just
happen to be my neighbor?

01:54:08.164 --> 01:54:09.366
And-And Ngoc Lan,
why are you

01:54:09.391 --> 01:54:11.251
the only person who
survived that box

01:54:11.391 --> 01:54:12.996
and you just happen
to be cleaning

01:54:13.021 --> 01:54:14.606
Dusan's place on that day?

01:54:14.682 --> 01:54:16.151
And-And had you
not lost your leg,

01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:18.252
I wouldn't have tried to
help you, which, as usual,

01:54:18.277 --> 01:54:19.370
I screwed up.

01:54:19.432 --> 01:54:21.221
And why did I screw it up?

01:54:21.339 --> 01:54:23.112
So that I could be here

01:54:23.292 --> 01:54:26.846
right at the exact moment
to go down into that tunnel.

01:54:27.466 --> 01:54:31.172
I finally have a chance to
do something that matters.

01:54:31.337 --> 01:54:33.368
Oh, Paul, come on,
now you're talking crazy.

01:54:33.485 --> 01:54:35.931
These people,
they're wonderful, but--

01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:37.290
It's like a cult.

01:54:37.485 --> 01:54:39.547
It's a cult. You know,
and the extinction, well,

01:54:39.665 --> 01:54:42.384
it's not gonna happen for, you
know, maybe few hundred years.

01:54:42.415 --> 01:54:44.493
Has nothing to do with you.
Forget it.

01:54:44.610 --> 01:54:47.438
Besides, you think they won't
behave like people always behave?

01:54:47.509 --> 01:54:49.853
They're all gonna go insane
down there and kill each other.

01:54:49.993 --> 01:54:51.946
They'll go extinct
long before we do.

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:05.586
Don't worry, darling.
He said it himself.

01:55:05.611 --> 01:55:07.665
Nothing he ever wants
to do works out.

01:55:45.265 --> 01:55:47.093
It's a beautiful day, huh?

01:55:47.992 --> 01:55:50.718
I mean, knowing this is the
last time I'll see the real sun,

01:55:50.743 --> 01:55:53.265
it makes it so... vibrant.

01:55:57.113 --> 01:56:01.145
I ask you question.
You say me truth. Okay?

01:56:01.276 --> 01:56:02.244
Of course.

01:56:02.541 --> 01:56:04.471
Other night on boat...

01:56:04.643 --> 01:56:06.502
what kind of fuck you give me?

01:56:07.117 --> 01:56:08.000
What?

01:56:08.062 --> 01:56:10.171
What kind of fuck you give me?

01:56:10.968 --> 01:56:13.093
What kind? I don't...

01:56:13.164 --> 01:56:15.500

01:56:20.929 --> 01:56:23.576

01:56:23.715 --> 01:56:26.309
Okay, I-I have no idea

01:56:26.426 --> 01:56:27.583
Third host family.

01:56:27.608 --> 01:56:29.895
Okay, Th-that is just wrong.

01:56:29.986 --> 01:56:32.080
Okay, there's a whole spectrum

01:56:32.105 --> 01:56:34.830
of-of emotions and-
and motivations.

01:56:35.197 --> 01:56:37.782
And don't say "fuck", i-it's vulgar.

01:56:37.876 --> 01:56:41.267
Say something else like, you know,
"make love" or I don't know.

01:56:41.433 --> 01:56:43.378
So... was love fuck?

01:56:46.745 --> 01:56:48.323
Okay, what is this all about?

01:56:52.019 --> 01:56:54.566
You look for me,

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:06.621
I think maybe pity fuck.

For leg.

01:57:07.676 --> 01:57:10.168

You are such an
extraordinary person

01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:18.387
and I just admire you so much.

01:57:19.362 --> 01:57:21.338
More than anything,

01:57:21.448 --> 01:57:23.386
I want you to come with me.

01:57:26.785 --> 01:57:29.019
People always say me I strong.

01:57:30.933 --> 01:57:32.808

01:57:54.891 --> 01:57:56.266
I really am.

01:57:57.813 --> 01:58:00.852
It's so easy for me
to see who you are.

01:58:01.282 --> 01:58:03.641
But if I don't do this,
who am I?

01:58:04.495 --> 01:58:06.565
I mean, really. Who <i>am</i> I?

01:58:07.273 --> 01:58:09.046

Kon booyem! Kon booyem!

02:00:04.692 --> 02:00:06.442
I guess this is it.

02:00:07.841 --> 02:00:08.927
Konrad.

02:00:10.037 --> 02:00:11.615
Very nice to have met you.

02:00:12.279 --> 02:00:13.646
Pleasure was mine.

02:00:14.208 --> 02:00:16.013
Good luck in there, Paul.

02:00:27.089 --> 02:00:28.690
Take care of yourself.

02:00:29.862 --> 02:00:30.846
I will.

02:00:31.729 --> 02:00:32.768
You too.

02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:36.010
I will miss my funny neighbor.

02:00:52.281 --> 02:00:53.688

02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.167
But it's in Vietnamese.

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.175
Words not matter.

02:01:03.651 --> 02:01:05.057
Remember me.

02:01:18.667 --> 02:01:20.089
You go away now.

02:02:13.579 --> 02:02:14.649
Excuse me.

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:15.782
Hi, uh...

02:02:15.868 --> 02:02:18.665
Is it just me or are
we walking uphill?

02:02:18.789 --> 02:02:21.172
Yes. Prevents flooding.

02:02:21.359 --> 02:02:24.359
-Tunde.
-Oh, hi. Paul.

02:02:25.251 --> 02:02:26.680
It's just a few hours climb

02:02:26.847 --> 02:02:28.862
before we begin
the descent to the vault.

02:02:29.003 --> 02:02:30.518
Well, how long
is the whole walk?

02:02:30.704 --> 02:02:32.823
Eleven hours.
Something like that.

02:02:33.165 --> 02:02:35.759
See you down there.
Stay hydrated.

02:03:31.715 --> 02:03:33.363

Thank you so much.

02:03:39.450 --> 02:03:41.168
-Wait, my bag.
-Leave it.

02:03:41.262 --> 02:03:42.215
No, no, no!

02:03:42.286 --> 02:03:44.825
I told you nothing ever
works out for this guy.

02:03:44.851 --> 02:03:47.523
-Get my bag out!
-It's going to blow! Run!

02:03:50.309 --> 02:03:51.739

02:03:52.301 --> 02:03:53.692
Ngoc Lan!

02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:03.893
I was thinking about
what you were saying.

02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:05.854
And I realized you were right.

02:04:06.376 --> 02:04:08.353
I <i>am</i> Paul Safranek.

02:04:09.228 --> 02:04:10.853

02:04:12.501 --> 02:04:14.321

02:05:35.149 --> 02:05:36.672

after survive TV box.

02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:57.847

02:05:58.909 --> 02:06:01.339

things more close.

02:07:07.698 --> 02:07:09.917
