00:07.937 --> 00:08.871
Hey. Hey, don't judge me.

00:11.007 --> 00:13.709
When you learn to wash a dish,
I'll get off the bottle.

00:15.478 --> 00:16.411
Morning.

00:16.446 --> 00:17.813
Man, I did not sleep at all last night.

00:17.847 --> 00:21.483
No, I do not need to hear about
your amazing sex life over my bagel.

00:22.709 --> 00:24.577
"I'm Ben. I have a girlfriend now.
I stay up all night doing it"

00:28.409 --> 00:29.409
okay, first of all,

00:29.443 --> 00:30.376
baby.

00:30.411 --> 00:31.845
Second of all,

00:31.379 --> 00:32.412
Riley slept at her place.

00:32.447 --> 00:34.214
And third of all, I do not sound like that.

00:35.416 --> 00:37.050
Wait...

00:37.085 --> 00:41.088
So, I had a baby in my room all night
that wasn't mine for no reason whatsoever?

00:41.122 --> 00:42.055
Yeah, thanks, bro.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.158
I've just had a lot on my mind.

00:45.193 --> 00:47.828
Hey,
what do you think about Danny and Riley?

00:47.862 --> 00:50.697
Well, he sucks up food like a hoover,
and she can be a bit bossy,

00:50.732 --> 00:51.898
but for the most part, I'm a fan.

00:53.267 --> 00:55.669
No. No, I mean, do you think there's
something going on between them?

00:55.737 --> 00:56.636
Um...

00:56.671 --> 00:58.538
B-b-between Riley and Danny?

00:58.573 --> 01:00.207
N-no, man.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.509
Dude, it's not like he's been
in love with her his whole life,

01:02.543 --> 01:05.045
and then finally realized
he'd never have her,

01:05.078 --> 01:06.279
so he's running away to Paris with Georgie.

01:08.383 --> 01:11.885
'Cause, uh,
that would be... that would be crazy.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.121
But,
you didn't see what happened on the roof?

01:14.155 --> 01:15.956
There was hugs, and tears,

01:15.990 --> 01:17.057
and what came very close to a kiss.

01:17.091 --> 01:19.659
Dude, they're best friends, okay?

01:19.694 --> 01:22.396
Just think how you'd react
if I told you I was moving.

01:23.765 --> 01:25.332
Um...

01:25.366 --> 01:26.400
I don't think I'd kiss you.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.502
You don't know that.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.172
Look, if you're so worried,

01:32.206 --> 01:33.306
why don't you just go talk to her?

01:33.341 --> 01:34.307
Oh, yeah, right.

01:34.342 --> 01:36.276
"Hey, Riley.
I'm your crazy, jealous boyfriend.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.878
Do you have any feelings for my brother?"

01:37.912 --> 01:39.079
See? See, you do sound like that!

01:39.113 --> 01:40.046
I told you.

01:40.081 --> 01:41.681
You know what?

01:41.716 --> 01:42.949
I don't care what you say, okay?

01:43.017 --> 01:44.818
There's definitely something
weird going on around here.

01:49.824 --> 01:51.558
Morning, boys.

01:51.592 --> 01:54.594
Bonnie's babysitting barn
is open for business.

01:54.629 --> 01:56.496
You birth 'em, we nurse 'em.

01:56.531 --> 01:59.366
Have your baby cared for
by a licensed professional.

01:59.400 --> 02:00.333
License pending.

02:03.304 --> 02:04.871
Nope.

02:04.906 --> 02:06.106
Nothing weird going on here.

Good, you're all here.

02:28.262 --> 02:30.197
Oh, shoot.
I forgot how many I started out with.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.035
Mom,
we have a strict "no baby" policy in here.

02:35.069 --> 02:37.270
You know, unless they show up on
the doormat with my DNA and a note.

02:38.339 --> 02:39.873
I'm sorry, honey.

02:39.907 --> 02:41.875
Just trying to earn a little extra cash,

02:41.909 --> 02:44.144
and I can only sell my blood twice a month.

02:44.178 --> 02:45.145
Or quit drinking.

02:46.247 --> 02:47.280
And that's not gonna happen.

02:49.884 --> 02:51.084
Hey, can I borrow a diaper?

02:55.022 --> 02:57.224
Hey,
whatever happened to your big realty job?

02:57.258 --> 02:59.993
It's fine. It's fine. It's great.

03:00.027 --> 03:04.130
You know, I just haven't sold quite as
many apartments as I thought I would have.

03:04.165 --> 03:05.866
Are you gonna use all this baby food?

03:06.934 --> 03:09.069
Okay. You know, plus, now that Danny

03:09.103 --> 03:12.005
is selfishly running away
to pursue his dreams,

03:12.039 --> 03:15.275
it is really putting a damper
on my memorabilia business.

03:15.309 --> 03:19.212
Oh, you mean your "secretly selling his
hockey stuff behind his back" business?

03:19.247 --> 03:20.881
Are you accusing me of stealing?

03:22.216 --> 03:23.183
Pretty much.

03:23.217 --> 03:24.951
Yeah. Yeah, that business.

03:26.053 --> 03:27.020
<i>Bonjour!</i>

03:27.054 --> 03:28.889
<i>Salut, mon amour.</i>

03:28.923 --> 03:30.056
<i>Tu est tres...</i>

03:30.091 --> 03:31.925
Adorable...

03:31.959 --> 03:33.260
I suppose Danny taught you how to say that?

03:33.294 --> 03:36.062
No, actually,
my 10th grade French teacher did,

03:36.097 --> 03:37.163
which...

03:37.198 --> 03:38.298
Is a whole other story.

03:38.332 --> 03:41.902
But I did bring some croissants
to put him in the mood.

03:41.936 --> 03:42.936
For love?

03:42.970 --> 03:44.237
No, for Paris.

03:44.272 --> 03:45.238
Ugh, I'm so jealous.

03:45.273 --> 03:47.207
Of Georgie?

03:47.241 --> 03:49.910
Again, no.

03:49.944 --> 03:51.044
But has anybody seen the real Ben?

03:51.078 --> 03:52.045
This one's broken.

03:53.347 --> 03:55.115
Oh, good, you're all here.

03:55.149 --> 03:56.917
Pretty cool, huh?

03:58.119 --> 04:00.120
Georgie bought it for me before she left.

04:00.154 --> 04:01.121
How do I look?

04:03.824 --> 04:05.225
Like the reason French people hate us.

04:09.196 --> 04:12.032
Ooh-la-la, what do we have here?

04:12.066 --> 04:15.135
Another hidden love note
from <i>mon </i> girlfriend.

04:16.202 --> 04:17.170
It means girlfriend.

04:19.005 --> 04:20.072
I don't know what <i> "mon" </i> means.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.878
She's been secretly leaving
them all over the place.

04:24.912 --> 04:26.980
Well, I think it's romantic.

04:27.014 --> 04:28.148
She's a lucky girl, that Georgie.

04:28.182 --> 04:29.883
Yeah, she sure is.

04:29.917 --> 04:32.018
I mean,
who wouldn't fall in love with Danny Wheeler?

04:32.053 --> 04:34.020
Can you think of anyone else who has?

04:34.055 --> 04:35.021
Anyone at all?

04:36.591 --> 04:38.625
Okay, seriously, has anyone seen Ben?

04:38.659 --> 04:40.393
Kinda scruffy, says things like,

04:40.428 --> 04:41.461
"hey, babe, what's up?"

04:42.697 --> 04:44.364
Why does everyone think I sound like that?

04:45.666 --> 04:48.168
Uh, Ben?
Ben, can I talk to you for a second?

04:48.202 --> 04:50.136
Out here, where nobody can hear us.

04:50.171 --> 04:52.105
About that problem that
we need to talk about.

04:52.139 --> 04:53.206
In private.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.076
What problem?

04:56.110 --> 04:57.177
You, man.

04:57.211 --> 04:59.913
It took Riley two decades to get you,

04:59.947 --> 05:01.848
and it's gonna take her
two days to dump you.

05:02.950 --> 05:03.984
Dude, she loves you.

05:04.855 --> 05:06.252
She wants to be with you.

05:06.352 --> 05:08.216
God knows, I have no idea why,

05:08.316 --> 05:09.349
but she does!

05:10.384 --> 05:12.285
You know what's missing from this pep talk?

05:12.320 --> 05:13.253
The pep!

05:15.923 --> 05:16.957
Okay, you're right.

05:16.991 --> 05:18.758
I'm an idiot.
There's obviously nothing going on

05:18.793 --> 05:19.993
between Riley and Danny.

05:20.061 --> 05:23.830
So, I just wanted to apologize
for the other night on the roof.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.699
Kinda caught me by surprise.

05:25.733 --> 05:28.568
Oh, no need to apologize.
I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.

05:28.603 --> 05:31.638
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It had just been a really emotional day.

05:31.672 --> 05:33.607
The big "I love Ben" announcement.

05:33.641 --> 05:35.308
And you really do, right?

05:35.343 --> 05:37.244
Oh my God, yes! So much!

05:38.379 --> 05:41.414
And you really love Georgie, huh?

05:41.449 --> 05:43.917
Oh my God, yes.

05:43.951 --> 05:44.885
So much.

05:46.154 --> 05:48.021
I think we need to shut
down the babysitting barn.

05:48.055 --> 05:51.091
There was some kind of tinkle
chain reaction in there.

05:52.126 --> 05:53.894
Okay, if Ben asks about his bedspread,

05:53.928 --> 05:55.495
you haven't seen it, okay?

05:55.530 --> 05:56.496
Okay.

05:56.531 --> 05:57.597
- Mom!
- Dammit!

05:59.600 --> 06:00.767
Oh, hey, tuck.

06:00.801 --> 06:03.336
You're just in time to witness
the magic that is Ben Wheeler,

06:03.371 --> 06:04.538
world's most amazing boyfriend.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.274
And you're about to witness
the magic that is Tucker Dobbs,

06:07.308 --> 06:08.608
world's least interested roommate.

06:10.378 --> 06:12.145
I took a page from Georgie's playbook,

06:12.180 --> 06:14.981
and slipped a little love
note into Riley's purse.

06:15.016 --> 06:17.217
Her heart is going to melt
like a grilled cheese sandwich.

06:17.251 --> 06:18.251
But, not the kind we serve here,

06:18.286 --> 06:19.886
'cause they're always cold in the middle.

06:20.888 --> 06:21.788
Sucks, right?

06:24.125 --> 06:25.759
Oh, here we go, people.

06:27.562 --> 06:28.562
Oh, darn it!

06:29.597 --> 06:30.797
Tucker, go make her open her purse.

06:31.832 --> 06:34.568
If I knew how to make women open things,

06:34.602 --> 06:36.703
do you think I'd be having
lunch here right now?

06:38.439 --> 06:40.607
I can't believe I'm getting on a
plane tonight after that charity game,

06:40.641 --> 06:42.108
and tomorrow morning,

06:42.143 --> 06:44.277
I'll be in gay Paris.

06:44.312 --> 06:46.046
I hope they're all cool that I'm straight.

06:50.017 --> 06:51.017
Honey, you'll be fine.

06:52.153 --> 06:53.286
Well, until you do leave,

06:53.321 --> 06:56.623
let's just spend as much
quality time together as we can.

06:56.657 --> 06:58.758
You know,
keep those lines of communication open.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.826
Aw, mom...

06:59.860 --> 07:01.828
Or, we could just keep the
chit-chat to a minimum,

07:01.862 --> 07:04.698
and you can sign these for
those orphans I told you about.

07:07.535 --> 07:08.602
So, Riley.

07:09.737 --> 07:11.438
Riles.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.405
Ri-ri.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.476
Hey, so, I was wondering if I could
have a piece of gum from your purse.

07:16.510 --> 07:18.311
Sorry, I just had the last piece.

07:18.346 --> 07:20.046
- Can I borrow your lip balm?
- I'm out.

07:20.081 --> 07:21.081
- A pen?
- Nope.

07:21.115 --> 07:22.015
- Breath mint?
- Sorry.

07:22.049 --> 07:23.183
- A lighter?
- Why do you need a lighter?

07:23.217 --> 07:24.150
How about a quarter?

07:24.185 --> 07:25.118
Oh...

07:28.723 --> 07:30.056
So, this thing's pretty much for show,
isn't it?

07:32.660 --> 07:33.827
Hey!

07:33.861 --> 07:36.429
Hey, is that Ben over there
trying to get your attention?

07:42.303 --> 07:43.270
What are you doing?

07:44.405 --> 07:46.006
Oh...

07:46.040 --> 07:49.242
Oh, so, you see a black man holding your
purse, and suddenly he's doing something?

07:57.084 --> 07:58.752
How could she not have found that note yet?

07:58.786 --> 08:01.021
Because she didn't have bolt
cutters to get into that purse.

08:02.990 --> 08:05.558
Tucker, I poured my heart out in that note.

08:05.626 --> 08:07.661
It contains my most intimate
thoughts and feelings.

08:08.663 --> 08:09.629
Wow.

08:09.664 --> 08:12.232
That must have been a really long note.

08:12.266 --> 08:13.533
Nah, it was just a couple of sentences.

08:19.106 --> 08:21.308
Hello? It's me.

08:21.342 --> 08:22.375
It's about time.

08:24.345 --> 08:26.146
Danny, we need to talk.

08:27.181 --> 08:28.114
I got your note.

08:29.850 --> 08:30.784
Danny?

08:32.119 --> 08:34.020
Quick question.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.621
Did you sign it?

08:39.202 --> 08:40.077
Danny?

08:40.102 --> 08:42.035
How could she think Danny
wrote her that note?

08:42.070 --> 08:44.705
Oh, hey, Riley, what's going on?

08:44.740 --> 08:46.807
We should probably let them
know that we're out here, right?

08:46.842 --> 08:48.843
Oh, no, no, no, no. I wanna hear every word.

08:51.446 --> 08:52.580
No!

08:53.649 --> 08:54.582
Is something wrong?

08:54.616 --> 08:56.417
We need to talk...

08:56.451 --> 08:57.451
About the note.

08:57.486 --> 08:59.554
Okay.

08:59.588 --> 09:01.489
But you go first,
'cause I don't know what we're talking about.

09:03.492 --> 09:05.026
Wait, you didn't...

09:07.095 --> 09:08.029
Get off of... no, no...

09:08.063 --> 09:09.030
What are you...

09:11.033 --> 09:13.067
Hey! Hey. Hey.

09:13.101 --> 09:15.069
I bet you guys didn't even
know that we were out there.

09:16.071 --> 09:17.838
Hey, Riley. What's up, baby?

09:19.074 --> 09:20.708
I don't want to stop your guys'
conversation.

09:20.742 --> 09:21.909
You guys were talking about a note?

09:21.944 --> 09:24.478
Yes. Uh, right.

09:24.513 --> 09:27.381
I was talking about the
note that Danny sent me...

09:27.416 --> 09:28.583
Yesterday...

09:28.617 --> 09:29.684
On my phone.

09:29.718 --> 09:32.353
Whh, I think, is sometimes called a text.

09:33.455 --> 09:35.222
Yes, right, exactly.

09:35.257 --> 09:37.158
Danny sent me a text note.

09:39.127 --> 09:41.128
Uh, so,
do you still need that ride to the airport?

09:41.163 --> 09:43.097
Um, actually,
I think I'm just gonna catch a cab.

09:43.131 --> 09:44.098
Thanks, though.

09:44.132 --> 09:45.066
Well, that's good.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.867
'Cause I don't have a car.

09:46.902 --> 09:47.868
So, all right.

09:47.903 --> 09:49.770
That's taken care of.

09:49.805 --> 09:50.905
Good. I gotta go. I am so...

09:50.939 --> 09:51.872
Bye.

09:51.907 --> 09:52.840
Heh.

09:52.874 --> 09:54.642
See?

09:54.676 --> 09:56.877
Now, don't you feel silly for overreacting?

09:57.846 --> 09:58.813
I'm gonna go check the mail.

09:58.847 --> 09:59.780
I already got the mail.

10:04.419 --> 10:06.387
Riley, what the hell was that?

10:06.421 --> 10:09.190
How could you possibly think
that note was from Danny?

10:09.224 --> 10:11.559
Well, I kind of heard a voice mail last year

10:11.593 --> 10:13.494
where he kind of said
he had feelings for me,

10:13.528 --> 10:15.463
so I kind of thought the note was from him,

10:15.497 --> 10:18.032
trying to tell me before he left for Paris.

10:18.066 --> 10:20.234
But... so,
you know how Danny feels about you?

10:20.268 --> 10:22.036
Yeah, kind of.

10:22.070 --> 10:24.138
Wait... so,
you know how Danny feels about me?

10:24.172 --> 10:25.773
Yeah, kind of.

10:25.807 --> 10:26.974
Tucker...

10:27.009 --> 10:28.643
Wait, but you love Ben?

10:28.677 --> 10:30.845
Yes! Oh my God, yes!

10:30.879 --> 10:31.979
What is wrong with me?

10:32.014 --> 10:34.415
That's a good question.

10:34.449 --> 10:35.850
But here's a better one, right?

10:35.884 --> 10:39.387
How did you get both of those
guys to fall in love with you?

10:39.421 --> 10:41.322
I mean, no offense, I'm just not seeing it.

10:45.293 --> 10:46.460
Ma'am,

10:46.495 --> 10:49.930
Bonnie's memorabilia barn is
dedicated to customer service.

10:49.965 --> 10:53.034
No, I am so sorry that you
haven't received your Jersey yet.

10:53.068 --> 10:55.703
You know what?
Let me transfer you to my supervisor,

10:55.737 --> 10:56.771
Mr. "click."

10:58.040 --> 10:59.907
- Hey, mom?
- Yeah, honey.

10:59.941 --> 11:01.776
Do you think Danny and Riley
are in love with each other?

11:04.746 --> 11:05.913
What?

11:05.947 --> 11:07.715
Danny and Riley?

11:07.749 --> 11:09.583
No. No, honey.

11:09.618 --> 11:10.685
There's no Danny and Riley.

11:10.719 --> 11:12.386
No, they're just best friends.

11:12.421 --> 11:15.289
I mean, you know,
it's not like he's loved her his entire life,

11:15.323 --> 11:17.158
and then finally realized he can't have her,

11:17.192 --> 11:19.126
so he's running away to Paris with Georgie.

11:20.395 --> 11:23.064
Because that would be crazy.

11:24.933 --> 11:26.867
Hey! Hey, could you do me a favor?

11:26.902 --> 11:29.070
And sleep in Danny's room while he's gone?

11:29.104 --> 11:31.939
My new website,
watch-Danny-Wheeler-sleep.Com,

11:31.973 --> 11:33.774
is really taking off.

11:33.809 --> 11:35.643
Yeah, sure.

11:35.677 --> 11:36.944
Wait, what?

11:36.978 --> 11:40.448
Yeah, yeah. People pay $19.99
a month to watch Danny sleep.

11:40.482 --> 11:43.384
If you use the coupon code "bonbon,"
you get 10% off.

11:44.519 --> 11:46.420
Can we please focus on your
other son for a moment?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.222
- I don't have another son.
- Me, mom! Me!

11:48.256 --> 11:50.357
Yes! Right, okay.

11:50.392 --> 11:52.126
Yeah.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.961
Yes, I am looking at you. I am focused.

11:53.995 --> 11:55.596
What, what, what, what?

11:55.630 --> 11:57.331
I'm almost sure there's something going on
between them. And I'm going to prove it.

11:57.365 --> 11:59.066
I wrote a little love note to Danny,

11:59.101 --> 12:01.102
signed Riley's name,
and slipped it into his coat.

12:01.136 --> 12:02.870
It's genius!

12:02.904 --> 12:05.639
Yeah, I'm not sure you're using the word
"genius" correctly.

12:05.674 --> 12:06.841
Mom, don't you get it?

12:06.875 --> 12:08.743
He's gonna find the note,
and go straight to Riley.

12:08.777 --> 12:09.677
Aha!

12:11.680 --> 12:15.516
Yeah, I'm not sure you're using the word
"aha" correctly.

12:15.550 --> 12:17.051
Then, he'll tell her he found the note,

12:17.085 --> 12:19.420
she'll say "what note?"
He'll say "the note you left in my pocket."

12:19.454 --> 12:21.255
She'll say,
"I didn't leave a note in your pocket."

12:21.323 --> 12:22.490
Then she's gonna grab the note and read it.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.624
And now for the big finale...

12:23.658 --> 12:26.093
And she'll realize I wrote it, and...

12:28.230 --> 12:29.363
She'll hate me for not trusting her.

12:31.266 --> 12:34.068
And she'll dump me because I'm a jealous
idiot, and I'll lose her forever.

12:35.036 --> 12:36.237
Oh, good.

12:36.271 --> 12:37.905
For a second there,
I thought you weren't gonna get it.

12:41.910 --> 12:44.445
Ugh. Voice mail again.

12:44.479 --> 12:46.680
Georgie and I just keep missing each other.

12:46.715 --> 12:50.417
Of course, it is tomorrow in Paris.

12:50.452 --> 12:52.219
So, maybe my call hasn't gotten there yet?

12:53.488 --> 12:55.156
Oh, I gotta get to the rink.

12:56.391 --> 12:58.192
So...

12:58.226 --> 12:59.260
I guess, this is it.

12:59.294 --> 13:01.262
For now.

13:01.296 --> 13:03.063
You're not getting rid of me that easily.

13:05.901 --> 13:06.867
Bye, Danny.

13:06.902 --> 13:08.035
Bye.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.938
Oh, hey, dude,
I'm about to hop on the plane...

13:10.972 --> 13:11.872
Yeah, catch you later.

13:13.775 --> 13:15.042
Really?

13:15.076 --> 13:17.645
Please tell me I did not just
walk in on a secret rendezvous?

13:17.679 --> 13:19.413
You can't keep putting me
in the middle like this.

13:19.447 --> 13:20.347
Tell me everything.

13:21.449 --> 13:25.219
Whoa,
it is just a goodbye dinner between friends.

13:25.253 --> 13:27.188
I can't believe I lied to Ben.

13:27.222 --> 13:29.390
You know,
a relationship should be built on honesty.

13:29.424 --> 13:31.392
- So, you're gonna tell him the truth?
- Oh my God, no.

13:32.994 --> 13:34.195
Oh, Danny forgot his jacket.

13:34.229 --> 13:37.097
Oh,
I should totally wear this while he's gone.

13:37.132 --> 13:39.700
This thing is a lady magnet.

13:41.670 --> 13:43.604
Yeah, tuck. It's the jacket.

13:44.906 --> 13:45.873
Oh.

13:45.907 --> 13:47.775
Another love note from Georgie.

13:49.778 --> 13:51.445
"Dear Danny,

13:51.479 --> 13:55.583
"I just want you to know that
you're the one that I really want.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.318
Love, Riley."

13:57.352 --> 13:58.552
"Love, Riley"?

13:58.587 --> 14:01.522
Oh, hey. Forgot my jacket.

14:01.556 --> 14:03.090
What's that?

14:03.124 --> 14:04.191
Nothing!

14:09.331 --> 14:11.198
I'm really gonna miss you.

14:17.469 --> 14:19.603
Love? Riley, how could you?

14:19.638 --> 14:23.207
What kind of sick and twisted person
falls in love with one brother,

14:23.241 --> 14:25.142
and then pretends that she
doesn't love the other brother,

14:25.177 --> 14:27.111
and then takes the first brother's
heart and just crushes it,

14:27.145 --> 14:28.879
and then takes the brother
that she didn't love,

14:28.914 --> 14:29.947
and... hold up, I got lost.

14:31.283 --> 14:32.249
Give me that.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.720
Ugh, I knew it!

14:36.755 --> 14:37.988
Ben wrote this.

14:38.023 --> 14:41.759
Look, look!
I don't put little hearts over my "I's"...

14:41.793 --> 14:43.661
Anymore.

14:43.695 --> 14:46.397
He is just the lowest of the low.

14:46.431 --> 14:47.531
Ben is going to pay for this.

14:47.566 --> 14:49.366
Ooh!

14:49.401 --> 14:50.301
Oh, now I see it.

14:52.504 --> 14:54.138
You're kinda hot when you're mad.

14:55.273 --> 14:56.273
Shut up, Tucker.

14:56.308 --> 14:58.209
Yeah, girl, keep it coming. Where you going?

14:58.243 --> 14:59.176
Come on.

15:04.850 --> 15:06.116
No Danny. Okay, perfect.

15:06.151 --> 15:08.152
Watch Emma and keep an eye out
while I look for that note.

15:10.121 --> 15:11.655
Ooh.

15:11.690 --> 15:15.793
I think Bonnie's memorabilia barn
needs to branch out to full team sales.

15:15.827 --> 15:16.861
I don't see it.

15:16.895 --> 15:18.696
Well, you know what, just check his bag.

15:19.731 --> 15:20.664
Hey!

15:21.733 --> 15:22.800
What the hell do you think you're doing?

15:22.834 --> 15:25.436
Um, I was, um... I was just, uh...

15:25.470 --> 15:27.571
Oh, hi, Bonnie, how are you?

15:27.606 --> 15:29.206
Hey, Jim.

15:29.241 --> 15:31.475
- How's the sleep apnea?
- Better.

15:31.510 --> 15:33.244
- What's with the...
- Oh, um...

15:33.278 --> 15:35.179
Oh my God, what's that guy doing?

15:35.213 --> 15:37.181
Hey, you! What are you doing?

15:37.215 --> 15:39.149
It's okay, I'm Danny Wheeler's brother.
Tell him, mom.

15:39.184 --> 15:40.918
Never seen him before in my life.

15:40.952 --> 15:41.919
Mom!

15:41.953 --> 15:44.889
Please, everybody knows I'm Danny's sister.

15:49.861 --> 15:52.296
Don't give me that look.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.465
I'm still the best role model you got, kid.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:07.412 --> 16:09.213
Wow. This is humbling.

16:09.247 --> 16:13.784
Wheeler, caught this jerk going through
your stuff. Says he's your brother.

16:13.818 --> 16:15.753
Yeah, that's my brother.

16:15.787 --> 16:17.021
Sorry.

16:17.055 --> 16:18.722
Weird your sister didn't recognize you.

16:20.992 --> 16:22.459
What are you doing here?

16:22.494 --> 16:23.594
Why are you going through my stuff?

16:23.628 --> 16:25.596
Could you maybe put some clothes on first,
dude?

16:25.630 --> 16:28.432
No. I'm actually showering.

16:28.466 --> 16:29.500
It's easier to do naked.

16:29.534 --> 16:31.569
Ben Wheeler!

16:31.603 --> 16:33.470
Do not think that you can
hide from me in here...

16:33.505 --> 16:35.072
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

16:35.106 --> 16:36.073
Riley!

16:36.107 --> 16:37.074
Hi.

16:39.945 --> 16:40.945
Mrs. Wheeler?

16:40.979 --> 16:42.079
Oh God!

16:42.113 --> 16:43.180
What are you doing?

16:43.214 --> 16:44.949
You don't get it.

16:44.983 --> 16:45.983
They're after me.

16:46.017 --> 16:47.918
Who's after you?

16:47.953 --> 16:49.019
The creditors!

16:49.054 --> 16:52.523
All I have left to sell
is my hair and my virtue.

16:52.557 --> 16:54.658
Oh, well, you could probably
get something for your hair.

16:56.661 --> 16:57.628
Here.

16:57.662 --> 16:59.730
This is why I am here.

16:59.764 --> 17:01.465
Care to explain it, Ben?

17:04.435 --> 17:07.104
Oh, no...

17:07.137 --> 17:08.172
Now we'll never know what it said.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.374
It is a love note, Danny,

17:10.407 --> 17:12.009
from me to you,

17:12.042 --> 17:13.377
that Ben forged to see how you'd react.

17:13.411 --> 17:14.345
What?

17:14.378 --> 17:16.280
I didn't know what else to do.

17:16.314 --> 17:18.248
I saw the two of you on
the roof the other night.

17:18.282 --> 17:20.084
And what did you see?

17:20.117 --> 17:22.786
Two friends who were upset
that they were gonna be apart?

17:22.820 --> 17:24.655
Two friends who were worried
about each other's future?

17:25.656 --> 17:26.790
Well, yeah, that's one perspective.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.793
It just seems like you have
feelings for each other.

17:29.828 --> 17:31.428
And you're right. We do.

17:31.463 --> 17:33.497
We do? Oh, God.

17:33.531 --> 17:36.266
Because that's what it
means to have a best friend.

17:36.301 --> 17:37.401
Right.

17:37.435 --> 17:39.136
Yeah, Ben.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.371
And if you would think for one second

17:40.405 --> 17:41.538
that I would go behind your back

17:41.573 --> 17:44.908
and steal a woman who has only
loved you her entire life,

17:44.943 --> 17:46.110
then you don't know me at all.

17:49.714 --> 17:51.649
I'm sorry, man.

17:51.683 --> 17:53.851
I guess since I've lost everything
else to you my whole life,

17:53.885 --> 17:55.653
I assumed I could lose Riley to you, too.

17:56.755 --> 17:57.721
She's not a prize.

17:57.756 --> 17:59.456
Actually...

17:59.524 --> 18:00.424
You know, I kind of am.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.728
Riley, maybe I was just jealous
of how close you and Danny are.

18:06.498 --> 18:08.298
I want to be the most
special guy in your life.

18:10.368 --> 18:12.269
How can you think that you weren't?

18:12.303 --> 18:14.338
Okay, seriously,
could you put a towel on or something?

18:14.372 --> 18:17.141
Don't worry, I'm going...

18:17.175 --> 18:19.376
To catch a plane to see
the woman of my dreams.

18:19.411 --> 18:22.146
A woman who loves me as
much as Riley loves you.

18:22.180 --> 18:23.914
Or... at least...

18:23.948 --> 18:25.049
Did before this whole thing.

18:26.951 --> 18:29.687
God, Riley,
why do I keep screwing things up?

18:29.721 --> 18:30.954
Well, if I knew the answer to that,

18:30.989 --> 18:33.691
I probably wouldn't be standing
in the men's shower right now.

18:34.726 --> 18:36.026
I feel like such a jerk.

18:36.061 --> 18:38.495
I wouldn't blame you if you
never wanted to talk to me again.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.464
You know what? You're right.

18:40.498 --> 18:42.433
I'm done talking to you.

18:42.467 --> 18:43.500
You are?

19:00.885 --> 19:01.885
Oh my God!

19:03.021 --> 19:04.722
- Mrs. Wheeler?
- Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

19:04.756 --> 19:05.889
You okay?

19:05.924 --> 19:07.758
- Come on.
- I can't...

19:07.792 --> 19:09.960
Roll the other way! Roll the other way.

19:11.696 --> 19:12.629
Okay.

19:12.664 --> 19:13.864
Use your core!

19:13.898 --> 19:15.666
I don't have a core!

19:15.700 --> 19:16.767
Okay, give me your hand...

19:20.538 --> 19:22.306
Sir, you're going to have to put that away.

19:22.373 --> 19:23.407
We're getting ready to push back.

19:23.441 --> 19:25.375
I just need to listen to this voice mail.

19:25.410 --> 19:27.444
It's from my girlfriend. We're in love.

19:27.479 --> 19:29.313
Okay. But hurry up.

19:32.350 --> 19:34.585
<i>Danny, it's me, Georgie.</i>

19:34.619 --> 19:37.254
<i>I've been trying to reach you for days.</i>

19:37.288 --> 19:38.455
<i>Sorry to do this over the phone.</i>

19:38.490 --> 19:41.425
<i>But we need to talk before
you get on the plane.</i>

19:41.459 --> 19:43.494
<i>I think I've made a terrible mistake.</i>

19:43.528 --> 19:45.429
<i>I don't think you should come to Paris.</i>

19:48.333 --> 19:49.366
Excuse me.

20:05.278 --> 20:08.247
So, what do you say we make Uncle
Danny's room into an Emma room?

20:08.281 --> 20:09.948
Ooh, I know I like that idea.

20:09.983 --> 20:12.084
Oh,
did Emma get a job so she could pay rent?

20:12.118 --> 20:13.986
Danny already paid his rent.

20:14.020 --> 20:16.154
Yeah, you know that, and I know that.

20:16.189 --> 20:18.123
But hans, the new roommate I got lined up,

20:18.157 --> 20:19.124
he don't know that.

20:20.860 --> 20:22.127
Hello, roomies.

20:23.329 --> 20:25.297
If anybody needs me,
I'll be in the free bedroom.

20:25.331 --> 20:27.966
As in, it's empty,
and I'm not paying for it.

20:28.001 --> 20:28.967
I sublet my apartment.

20:29.002 --> 20:30.936
Oh, hell no!

20:30.970 --> 20:32.971
Okay.

20:33.006 --> 20:35.140
No, this is not gonna be happening.

20:38.244 --> 20:40.012
Sorry, Tucker, I need this!

20:41.147 --> 20:42.781

20:43.816 --> 20:44.950
