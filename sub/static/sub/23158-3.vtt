WEBVTT

03:16.516 --> 03:18.388
Clay?

03:22.851 --> 03:24.926
Clay.

03:29.062 --> 03:31.137
Oh.

03:35.439 --> 03:37.514
Oh, Clay !

03:44.693 --> 03:47.313
You know, Clay,

03:47.361 --> 03:52.696
sometimes you can be an absolute child.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.439
Clay?

04:09.119 --> 04:10.363
Oh !

04:14.162 --> 04:15.821
Agh !

04:18.872 --> 04:20.827
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.007
Oh, no. Clay !

05:11.184 --> 05:12.761
Clay.

05:13.893 --> 05:16.383
Clay, help me !

05:17.561 --> 05:19.103
No, no !

05:33.734 --> 05:35.809
Hey, TC, where's Rick?

05:35.860 --> 05:37.935
And what smells so good?

05:37.986 --> 05:41.684
- Navarin aux pommes.
- Yeah. That's lamb, baby.

05:41.737 --> 05:43.859
Yeah. For me and my date.

05:43.905 --> 05:47.982
Rick, you have to break your date.
I got paid. We're gonna celebrate.

05:48.031 --> 05:50.865
- Sorry, Thomas.
- No, Rick, this is special.

05:50.907 --> 05:53.527
The Red Light Club.
You know the act there?

05:53.575 --> 05:54.669
Sorry.

05:54.700 --> 05:59.276
TC, I don't think he heard me.
Rick, I'm talking about the Red Light Club.

05:59.327 --> 06:02.362
The one the vice cops
close every couple of months.

06:02.412 --> 06:03.988
Hey, I'm with you, TM.

06:04.037 --> 06:09.787
Look, I know there was a time when an offer
like that would have interested me but...

06:10.873 --> 06:15.034
...those days are gone. I want more out of life
than booze and one-night stands.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.999
- Why?
- Because in just a little while,

06:18.043 --> 06:22.120
a woman who I'm very in love with
is about to walk right through that door.

06:22.169 --> 06:23.995
Really? Who?

06:24.045 --> 06:27.625
Her name is Janice Cooper.
I met her right here at the club.

06:27.671 --> 06:30.789
That's great.
I didn't even know about it, Rick. When?

06:30.839 --> 06:32.297
Two days ago.

06:36.299 --> 06:39.998
Two days ago,
and you're seriously in love with her?

06:40.051 --> 06:42.089
Hey. When it's right, it's right.

06:43.719 --> 06:48.378
Wait. I got this feeling right here in my gut.
I think she's got the same feeling.

06:48.429 --> 06:51.214
It could be something you ate.

06:52.681 --> 06:55.217
Don't you guys have anywhere to go?

06:55.265 --> 06:57.055
Now wait a minute.

06:57.099 --> 07:00.430
Rick, if this girl is so special,
I want to meet her.

07:00.475 --> 07:02.301
Yeah, me too.

07:03.393 --> 07:07.305
All right. Five minutes.
Then both of you disappear.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.979
I can't understand where she can be.

07:28.444 --> 07:30.352
Maybe she got lost.

07:30.403 --> 07:33.153
No, she's been here before.

07:33.196 --> 07:37.357
I'm sorry, Rick.
Why don't you just give her a call?

07:49.410 --> 07:51.318
- 'Hello? '
- Janice?

07:51.370 --> 07:54.155
'No, Lynn. I'm house-sitting for her.'

07:54.204 --> 07:57.203
- Where's Janice?
- 'She's getting married.'

07:57.247 --> 07:59.285
- Married?
- 'Yeah.'

07:59.331 --> 08:03.540
'She cried for ever to Larry on Monday
and today flies to Tahiti to get married.

08:03.582 --> 08:07.494
- 'Isn't it the nuts? '
- Yeah, it's... it's the nuts.

08:07.542 --> 08:10.162
'Who should I say called? '

08:10.210 --> 08:12.450
Tell her Rick called and I...

08:12.503 --> 08:16.663
Just tell her that I...
Tell her Rick called and I wish her the best.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.423
Poor guy.

08:36.678 --> 08:38.753
Yeah.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.509
Give me a plate, will you? Thanks.

08:44.556 --> 08:46.429
Open the champagne.

08:54.518 --> 08:58.845
Kemo, Scotch on the rocks, keep them
coming and don't break the rhythm.

08:58.895 --> 09:01.728
- And give me a cigarette.
- Rick, you quit.

09:01.771 --> 09:03.727
I just started again.

09:04.606 --> 09:07.095
Come on, come on. Give me the cigarette.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.373
Excuse me.

10:01.919 --> 10:04.373
Are you a member of the club?

10:07.296 --> 10:09.038
No, I'm not.

10:11.172 --> 10:13.876
But it was so lovely here, I...

10:18.925 --> 10:22.707
- Forgive me, of course I'll leave.
- No, no. Please don't leave.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.376
Stay here and be my guest.
My name's Rick. I manage the club.

10:26.428 --> 10:29.000
What's your name?

10:29.054 --> 10:31.425
- My name is Sara.
- Sara.

10:31.472 --> 10:34.590
Sara, I couldn't help
but notice how upset you are.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.804
Is there anything I can do to help?
Anything at all?

10:38.891 --> 10:40.883
That's very kind of you, Rick.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.385
But there's really nothing
anyone can do now.

10:45.435 --> 10:48.719
Why don't you try me?
I'm really a good listener.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.095
It's hopeless.

10:53.522 --> 10:57.185
Why don't er...
Why don't we take a walk on the beach?

10:57.231 --> 10:59.721
We could talk about it.

11:01.316 --> 11:03.391
Trust me.

11:15.322 --> 11:18.107
It's so beautiful.

11:19.615 --> 11:22.021
I love the ocean.

11:22.074 --> 11:27.658
It's so independent of us,
of the world that we think is so important.

11:27.701 --> 11:30.819
It's the one thing that lets me feel truly free.

11:30.869 --> 11:34.911
- Why wouldn't you feel free?
- It's really very simple.

11:34.954 --> 11:39.163
There's a man who loves me and because
I don't love him, he'll destroy me.

11:39.206 --> 11:41.280
What man?

11:41.332 --> 11:43.370
His name is Henry Ellison.

11:44.499 --> 11:47.452
The shipping magnate?
He must be in his 60s.

11:47.501 --> 11:52.373
- Oh, no. Henry's very young. Your age.
- Young or old, what's the difference?

11:52.419 --> 11:57.208
You don't need the aggravation. Life's too
short. Go and do whatever you wanna do.

11:57.254 --> 11:59.329
I wish I could be that way.

12:00.547 --> 12:03.961
But that's the one great difference
between us.

12:20.763 --> 12:24.177
- Forgive me, it's the champagne.
- No, it's not.

12:39.270 --> 12:41.143
Would you mind?

12:42.230 --> 12:44.185
Sure.

12:45.106 --> 12:47.014
I'll be right back.

12:56.277 --> 12:58.268
Hey, Sara, why don't we...

13:06.074 --> 13:08.149
Sara.

13:08.531 --> 13:10.606
Sara !

13:13.425 --> 13:14.622
Agh !

13:14.675 --> 13:16.382
I am hurt.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.093
A plague on both your houses.

13:23.018 --> 13:25.093
I am hurt.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.212
A plague on both your houses.

13:31.397 --> 13:32.839
I am hurt.

13:32.932 --> 13:35.007
A plague on both your houses.

13:35.358 --> 13:37.396
I am sped.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.433
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

13:41.985 --> 13:44.190
Higgins, what are you doing?

13:45.237 --> 13:47.477
Was your American education so lacking?

13:47.529 --> 13:50.528
That's Shakespeare.
Romeo And Juliet. Act 3, Scene 1.

13:50.572 --> 13:51.686
Of course.

13:51.739 --> 13:55.900
I'm staging it for the Shakespeare Society.
I wanted to speak to you about it.

13:55.949 --> 14:00.442
- I'd like your participation.
- Me? You want me to act?

14:00.492 --> 14:02.448
No.

14:02.493 --> 14:07.069
I wouldn't dream of giving you lines.
We need supernumeraries.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.779
- Super what?
- Extras.

14:08.829 --> 14:11.614
It was Lydia Shaftsbury's idea.

14:11.663 --> 14:15.575
- The dizzy one who wears all the feathers?
- Our patroness, yes.

14:15.623 --> 14:19.321
- She thinks you'd look good in tights.
- Forget it, Higgins.

14:19.374 --> 14:22.741
Mrs Shaftsbury's patronage
is essential to our society.

14:22.792 --> 14:24.167
Higgins.

14:24.210 --> 14:25.407
No.

14:25.460 --> 14:29.290
I'd consider letting you use the sauna.
Works wonders for a hangover.

14:29.337 --> 14:31.411
Adieu, Higgins.

14:52.762 --> 14:55.133
Am I glad I caught you. I need your help.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.218
- What for?
- I gotta find this woman.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.216
Rick, she stood you up. Leave it alone.

15:00.265 --> 15:02.303
Not Janice. Sara.

15:02.349 --> 15:04.554
Sara? Who's Sara?

15:04.600 --> 15:08.927
Last night I met this woman. We took a walk
on the beach. Next thing, she's gone.

15:08.977 --> 15:11.264
Don't play games. It's time for brunch.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.014
I'm not playing games.
She's something special.

15:14.062 --> 15:17.429
- You know after one night?
- Pal, when it's right, it's right.

15:17.480 --> 15:21.392
- Where have I heard that before?
- Are you gonna help me or what?

15:24.858 --> 15:25.972
Ha.

15:28.984 --> 15:33.524
Tell them to fill that hole on the way back.
I don't want any empty spaces.

15:33.569 --> 15:36.237
Call me
when the Merkel leaves Amsterdam.

15:36.279 --> 15:42.479
I'm not in the habit of granting impromptu
interviews to private investigators.

15:42.531 --> 15:46.147
We appreciate that, Mr Ellison.
This should take a second.

15:46.199 --> 15:49.364
We were looking for someone
We thought you could help.

15:49.409 --> 15:51.732
Her name is Sara.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.699
I probably know a dozen.

15:55.452 --> 15:59.697
She's about 25, dark hair,
and very good-Iooking.

15:59.746 --> 16:02.994
I'm afraid you gentlemen
have made a mistake.

16:03.039 --> 16:07.994
Now, most of my acquaintances
are a generation older, at least.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.874
Well, she mentioned you by name, sir.

16:12.626 --> 16:15.080
Wait a minute.

16:15.127 --> 16:17.746
That's her. That's Sara.

16:18.795 --> 16:22.493
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- It's no joke, Mr Ellison.

16:22.546 --> 16:25.960
- That's the woman I met on the beach.
- That's impossible.

16:27.506 --> 16:30.292
Sara Clifford died 35 years ago.

16:37.969 --> 16:41.252
Actually, things like this
have happened before.

16:41.303 --> 16:46.092
Several people who knew Sara
say that they've seen her over the years.

16:46.138 --> 16:50.347
The stories are always the same. One
moment she's there, the next she's gone.

16:50.390 --> 16:53.048
Look, Mr Ellison,
I didn't kiss a ghost last night.

16:53.089 --> 16:54.831
No, I don't believe that you did.

16:57.301 --> 16:59.458
What did the woman say about me?

16:59.510 --> 17:02.877
She said that you loved her
and that you'd destroy her.

17:06.731 --> 17:07.825
Well...

17:08.912 --> 17:11.069
She was right about one thing.

17:12.557 --> 17:14.632
I loved Sara.

17:18.643 --> 17:21.925
When she died, something in me did, too.

17:23.478 --> 17:25.718
I never married.

17:28.188 --> 17:30.096
Never forgot.

17:33.982 --> 17:37.396
Someone's playing a very cruel trick on me,

17:37.441 --> 17:38.816
or you.

17:46.653 --> 17:49.321
I'm afraid this is all we have
on Sara Clifford.

17:49.363 --> 17:53.358
The society books and magazines
of the summer of '45 are not on the shelves.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.231
Thank you.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.897
- Did somebody check them out?
- No, they're reference materials.

17:58.950 --> 18:02.612
They could have been stolen.
We do have a problem with that.

18:02.659 --> 18:05.943
Has anyone else been doing research
on Sara Clifford?

18:05.994 --> 18:08.032
Let's see. Not recently.

18:08.078 --> 18:10.069
Not that I know of.

18:10.120 --> 18:15.242
There was a young woman about
a year ago. Some kind of relative.

18:15.289 --> 18:19.498
Said that she was doing a book
on the Clifford woman.

18:19.541 --> 18:21.746
- Do you remember her name?
- Hmm...

18:23.501 --> 18:27.543
Do you keep any old records?
Something that might have her name on it.

18:27.585 --> 18:31.581
No. She never checked anything out.
Did all of her work here.

18:31.629 --> 18:37.331
- Can't you tell me anything about her?
- She was pretty. She was very pretty.

18:39.006 --> 18:41.922
But I don't suppose
that means anything to you.

18:48.843 --> 18:50.634
Why would she think that?

18:50.677 --> 18:53.593
Sara Clifford.
I know a few things about her.

18:55.763 --> 19:02.177
You know, Magnum, you tend to lack
a sense of reciprocity, of give-and-take.

19:02.223 --> 19:07.096
I've tried hard to accommodate your
presence. I think I've been a good sport.

19:07.142 --> 19:11.386
- Yet when I ask a simple favour of you...
- Like what?

19:11.435 --> 19:15.727
Spending three hours a night in leotards
just to please Lydia Shraftsburg?

19:15.770 --> 19:17.643
Lydia Shaftsbury.

19:17.688 --> 19:21.185
Who single-handedly
has kept the Shakespeare Society alive,

19:21.231 --> 19:25.356
thereby contributing immeasurably
to the cultural life of Honolulu.

19:25.399 --> 19:27.556
That seems to mean very little to you.

19:27.608 --> 19:28.805
Very.

19:30.151 --> 19:33.849
Evidently, so does
this Sara Clifford business.

19:38.779 --> 19:41.648
It was quite a scandal at the time,
you know.

19:41.697 --> 19:44.731
Of course,
it was long before I came to Hawaii.

19:44.781 --> 19:48.230
I was at the time, I think, in Kwangju,

19:48.283 --> 19:50.570
or was I already in Beirut?

19:50.617 --> 19:54.398
All right, Higgins, I'll do the play.

19:57.328 --> 20:02.366
What I know has been pieced together
from conversations with Ethel Schiller,

20:02.413 --> 20:05.744
a friend of the Cliffords.
Charming woman, good family,

20:05.789 --> 20:08.326
but plays a dreadful game of bridge.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.661
Higgins, what about Sara?

20:10.708 --> 20:12.284
Oh.

20:12.333 --> 20:15.866
She was simply the most beautiful woman
in Honolulu society.

20:15.918 --> 20:18.538
No man could meet her
without falling in love.

20:18.586 --> 20:21.289
Led to quite a few quarrels. Even a duel.

20:21.337 --> 20:25.581
After the war, the Cliffords
suffered some sort of a disgrace.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.298
They were ostracised from society.

20:28.339 --> 20:32.631
I wouldn't imagine you'd understand
that sort of thing, would you, Magnum?

20:32.674 --> 20:35.460
On the other hand, perhaps you would.

20:35.509 --> 20:39.456
Anyway, Sara Clifford
supposedly killed herself over it,

20:39.510 --> 20:44.502
although a lot of people found that hard
to believe, didn't think she was the type.

20:50.973 --> 20:54.838
Ethel Schiller believes it was because
of some affaire de coeur.

20:54.891 --> 20:57.890
- What?
- Romance.

20:57.934 --> 20:59.557
Of course.

20:59.601 --> 21:02.553
She disappeared from her home
during a party one night.

21:02.602 --> 21:06.183
They found the car the next day
in the waters off Koko Head.

21:06.229 --> 21:08.516
She'd driven it over the cliff.

21:08.563 --> 21:11.562
Never found the body,
currents carried it out to sea.

21:11.606 --> 21:15.186
There have been reports
that she now haunts her old estate

21:15.232 --> 21:18.681
but I tend to disregard rumours
of the nether world.

21:18.733 --> 21:20.938
The nether world?

21:22.110 --> 21:25.559
- Have you grilled me sufficiently?
- Yes, I think so, Higgins.

21:25.611 --> 21:30.436
Family scandal, affaire de coeur,
and links to the netherworld.

21:30.488 --> 21:32.728
Thank you very much.

21:34.698 --> 21:36.570
Oh, Magnum, by the by,

21:36.615 --> 21:41.903
our designer says
you can try on your tights this afternoon.

22:05.334 --> 22:09.495
'If any place looked like it should be
haunted, it was the Clifford estate.

22:09.544 --> 22:12.378
'The overgrowth and the cobwebs
were all legit.

22:12.420 --> 22:17.329
'Not that I was scared, but I did make a point
of going in the daytime.

24:44.436 --> 24:47.933
'If I believed in ghosts,
I'm sure I'd be frightened by now.

24:47.979 --> 24:52.473
'But since I didn't, the pounding in my chest
must have been due to exertion.'

24:54.982 --> 24:57.057
God !

24:58.233 --> 24:59.810
Oh.

24:59.859 --> 25:02.229
There you are.

25:03.152 --> 25:05.190
- Hi, I'm Thomas.
- No.

25:05.236 --> 25:10.571
Ooh. It talks. OK. Would you mind telling me
what's going on here?

25:14.239 --> 25:17.937
All right, I'll explain.
See, you're supposed to be dead.

25:17.991 --> 25:22.199
But if you were alive, you'd be old enough
to be my mother, which you're not,

25:22.242 --> 25:26.107
so would you tell me who you are and why
you dress up like Gene Tierney?

25:28.703 --> 25:30.778
I'm Sara Clifford.

25:31.954 --> 25:34.076
And I'm trying to set things right.

25:34.122 --> 25:40.037
Set things right? Terrific,
then we're after the same thing. Can I help?

25:40.082 --> 25:42.702
- Do you mean that?
- Of course I do.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.791
What's set wrong?

25:47.543 --> 25:49.535
- He did kill me.
- Who?

25:49.586 --> 25:51.494
Henry Ellison.

25:52.587 --> 25:54.709
Henry Ellison?

25:54.755 --> 25:57.374
OK. Why didn't you call the police?

26:00.007 --> 26:02.294
Oh, I forgot.

26:02.341 --> 26:05.091
The police don't believe in the nether world.

26:05.133 --> 26:09.342
What did Henry do? Put you in the car
and pushed you right off the cliff?

26:11.344 --> 26:13.419
No.

26:15.054 --> 26:17.211
- He did it here.
- Here?

26:17.263 --> 26:18.887
Where?

26:22.432 --> 26:25.051
- Where did you get that?
- What?

26:26.183 --> 26:28.258
This?

26:29.434 --> 26:30.679
SCI

26:30.726 --> 26:34.804
The potting shed.
He did it in the potting shed.

26:34.853 --> 26:38.635
Whooo. I am tired of these games, Sara,
or whatever your...

26:38.688 --> 26:42.055
Oh, come on !
Will you wait a minute? Come on.

26:43.606 --> 26:45.397
Ooh !

27:11.158 --> 27:14.656
Mein Hut, es hat drei Ecken,

27:14.701 --> 27:18.910
drei Ecken hat mein Hut.

27:18.953 --> 27:22.534
Und hatt er nicht drei Ecken,

27:22.579 --> 27:24.867
so war es nicht mein Hut.

27:25.747 --> 27:30.537
- Ah. Congratulations, you're alive. Good.
- Are you the one who hit me?

27:30.582 --> 27:33.416
- Huh?
- Are you the one who hit me?

27:33.459 --> 27:37.121
Yes.
I am the one that hit you with the shovel.

27:37.168 --> 27:38.875
Any particular reason?

27:39.919 --> 27:41.958
Any particular reason?

27:42.003 --> 27:46.248
Because I am the caretaker.
And you were trespassing.

27:46.297 --> 27:49.746
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- Hmm?

27:49.798 --> 27:53.924
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- I heard you. I have no phone here.

27:53.966 --> 27:56.752
- I see.
- Here is your hat.

27:56.801 --> 28:01.211
This is your lucky-day hat.
What are you doing here, anyway?

28:01.261 --> 28:03.797
Why didn't you ask me that
before you swung?

28:03.845 --> 28:05.042
What?

28:05.095 --> 28:07.550
Why didn't you tell me that
before you swung?

28:07.596 --> 28:10.086
I would have lost the advantage of surprise.

28:10.139 --> 28:12.296
I see.

28:12.348 --> 28:15.466
I'm trying to find out about Sara Clifford.

28:16.850 --> 28:19.553
Did you see her today?

28:20.601 --> 28:23.636
I saw someone who said she was Sara.

28:26.103 --> 28:29.470
It was Sara all right. I saw her myself.

28:29.521 --> 28:32.888
She has been coming out more lately.
Come here.

28:34.732 --> 28:38.229
She is very lovely, is she not?

28:38.275 --> 28:40.065
Sara Clifford's dead.

28:41.234 --> 28:43.724
Of course she's dead.

28:43.777 --> 28:47.854
That's why she never changes.

28:47.903 --> 28:52.444
I see. What... Have you worked
for the Cliffords for a long time?

28:52.488 --> 28:55.441
The Cliffords, I have worked for them...

28:55.490 --> 28:58.358
Would you help me up, please?

28:58.407 --> 29:02.734
Thank you. I have worked for the Cliffords
since the Anschluss.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.859
1938.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.909
What can you tell me about Sara?
About how she died?

29:07.953 --> 29:13.904
Not very much, I'm afraid. I was away.
The one you should talk to is Lisa Paige.

29:13.955 --> 29:19.029
She was going to write about Sara.
That would be a very good book.

29:19.082 --> 29:22.365
But it would also, unfortunately,
be a very sad book.

29:22.416 --> 29:25.415
Thank you, Josef. I'll do that. Lisa Paige.

29:25.459 --> 29:28.494
It would be a good book,
not trashy like the books you see.

29:28.544 --> 29:31.247
I know, Josef, you told me that.

29:31.295 --> 29:36.167
The next time that you come,
try to let me know that you're coming

29:36.213 --> 29:40.707
to avoid the unpleasantness with the shovel
on the head. That would be best.

29:50.469 --> 29:54.085
'I used a standard investigative technique
to find Lisa Paige.

29:54.137 --> 29:57.835
'I checked the phone book.
Actually, there were only a few listings.

29:57.888 --> 30:03.045
'After a few dead ends, I hoped, for Rick's
sake, this was the woman we wanted.

30:03.098 --> 30:07.722
'Well, to be honest, for my own sake.
I just wanted to get him off my back.'

30:07.767 --> 30:11.050
- What does this Lisa know about Sara?
- I don't know.

30:12.352 --> 30:16.810
- Well, why is she writing a book about her?
- I don't know.

30:19.771 --> 30:23.352
- Are you sure this is where this Lisa lives?
- I don't know.

30:24.732 --> 30:27.055
- Maybe...
- Rick ! Shh.

30:32.943 --> 30:35.776
- You think Sara's here?
- I don't know !

30:48.574 --> 30:50.198
Sara.

30:50.241 --> 30:53.193
- Pardon me?
- It's me, Sara, Rick.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.779
I'm sorry. I don't know anybody named Rick.

30:58.411 --> 31:00.284
Why are you lying?

31:00.328 --> 31:04.324
I don't know what you're talking about.
My name is Lisa Paige. I'm sorry.

31:04.372 --> 31:06.410
- You're Sara.
- Don't do that !

31:06.456 --> 31:09.371
- I don't know what you are talking about.
- It's her.

31:09.415 --> 31:12.035
Would you explain what's going on?

31:12.083 --> 31:16.244
- Are you writing a book on Sara Clifford?
- Yes, I am.

31:16.293 --> 31:21.284
Well, both of us have seen Sara Clifford.
Or someone who says she is.

31:21.336 --> 31:25.414
That's very interesting.
Would you two please come in?

31:34.716 --> 31:36.957
This way, gentlemen.

31:47.221 --> 31:49.343
Have you seen Sara more than once?

31:49.389 --> 31:52.506
- No.
- Once was all it took.

31:54.224 --> 31:56.891
You... She got to me.

31:58.392 --> 32:01.973
- Got to you?
- I was very upset and very alone and...

32:02.018 --> 32:04.093
- She just got to me, that's all.

32:04.144 --> 32:06.349
- I see.
- It's really a lousy trick...

32:06.395 --> 32:09.145
- Rick, come on.
- Well, it's really lousy.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.720
Do you think we could have a cup of coffee?

32:13.773 --> 32:15.645
No coffee.

32:17.899 --> 32:19.772
All I have is tea.

32:19.817 --> 32:21.559
Tea would be great.

32:22.610 --> 32:25.146
Why don't you have a seat?

32:27.278 --> 32:30.028
- That's her. That's her.
- Maybe.

32:30.071 --> 32:33.319
- You saw her.
- I never saw her close.

32:33.364 --> 32:37.655
If you don't stay calm, we won't be here
long enough to find out if she is.

32:37.699 --> 32:40.402
I hope you won't tell on me.

32:40.450 --> 32:43.117
I plan to return those things.

32:43.159 --> 32:47.046
- Why did you decide to write about her?
- It's the kind of thing people like.

32:47.077 --> 32:51.535
Beautiful, wealthy, young woman,
tragic love affair, family scandal, suicide.

32:51.579 --> 32:53.369
And a ghost.

32:53.413 --> 32:55.120
Is that the only reason?

32:55.164 --> 32:56.491
No.

32:59.123 --> 33:00.782
She was my aunt.

33:08.210 --> 33:11.375
The man in this picture is Clayton Wright.

33:15.671 --> 33:19.120
They were in love
and they wanted to get married.

33:19.173 --> 33:22.670
But she couldn't
because of a family obligation.

33:23.758 --> 33:26.543
Supposedly, Sara committed suicide.

33:26.592 --> 33:28.833
Clayton never believed that...

33:28.885 --> 33:30.959
And neither do I.

33:32.219 --> 33:35.088
Unfortunately,
he died a couple of years ago.

33:35.137 --> 33:37.840
Did he have any idea who killed her?

33:37.888 --> 33:40.556
- He never said.
- Do you?

33:42.390 --> 33:44.464
Nothing to take to court.

33:45.683 --> 33:47.508
Who knows?

33:47.558 --> 33:50.261
Maybe the murderer will show his hand.

33:50.309 --> 33:53.143
After 35 years, I doubt it.

33:53.185 --> 33:55.971
Unless... someone forces it.

33:59.313 --> 34:01.388
Excuse me.

34:09.608 --> 34:11.399
What are you doing?

34:26.697 --> 34:28.773
Rick.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.029
Get out.

34:45.914 --> 34:47.572
Get out.

34:47.623 --> 34:49.579
- Why?
- Get out !

35:26.304 --> 35:28.675
I'll never fall in love again. Never.

35:28.722 --> 35:31.258
I wonder why she led me all over the estate.

35:31.306 --> 35:34.755
What did I ever get from being in love?
What?

35:34.807 --> 35:39.052
From the tennis courts
to the hothouse to the potting shed.

35:39.101 --> 35:43.676
Nothing.
Nothing but a lot of pain and heartache.

35:43.727 --> 35:47.769
But I'll tell you something, pal.
I appreciate your help. You found Sara,

35:47.812 --> 35:51.226
or Lisa, or whatever the hell
she's calling herself now.

35:51.272 --> 35:54.187
One thing's obvious,
she doesn't give a damn about me.

35:54.231 --> 35:57.977
Then that scarf,
half in the ground, half out of it.

35:58.024 --> 36:01.059
Don't try and make it easy on me.
I can take it.

36:01.109 --> 36:05.021
I know it's over. I really do.
I just don't care. I don't care.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.734
I wonder why she did that?

36:09.779 --> 36:12.446
What was it? It was one night,

36:12.488 --> 36:15.108
one walk on the beach in the moonlight.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.030
One kiss.

36:18.074 --> 36:22.614
- Boy, if I ever fall in again, they'll bury me.
- I think you're right.

36:22.659 --> 36:25.195
Hi. You doing anything this afternoon?

36:25.243 --> 36:28.657
He's the one in love.
What do I get out of this?

36:28.703 --> 36:32.283
Fresh air, exercise,
hearty male companionship.

36:32.329 --> 36:35.613
- I had enough of that in Nam.
- Why the potting shed?

36:35.664 --> 36:37.702
That's where the ghost disappeared.

36:37.748 --> 36:40.237
- Ghost?
- TC, will you keep your voice down?

36:40.290 --> 36:43.953
It's not a real ghost.
Lisa just dressed up like a ghost.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.126
She dropped a scarf. I figure that's where
she wants me to dig for the body.

36:48.168 --> 36:50.705
- Body?
- TC, you don't have to dig.

36:50.753 --> 36:52.958
You can stand guard while I reconnoitre.

36:53.003 --> 36:58.161
- Stand guard? For what?
- Josef. The caretaker. He's a bit eccentric.

36:58.214 --> 37:04.829
Hey, if he's standing guard and you're
reconnoitring, who's doing the digging?

37:11.177 --> 37:14.425
Psst ! Can't you dig any faster?

37:14.470 --> 37:19.343
- You wanna come down here and try?
- Hey, lover boy, I ain't the one that's in love.

37:21.931 --> 37:25.878
He's coming. He's coming. Come on.

37:36.937 --> 37:41.062
I wish that you were looking as well
as the grapevines.

37:42.272 --> 37:44.643
Guten Abend.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.393
Watch that shovel, he uses it like a mace.

37:47.441 --> 37:50.642
You watch it.
I ain't got nothing to say to the man.

37:57.570 --> 38:00.438
...better than you looked this afternoon.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.059
Guys?

38:03.113 --> 38:08.733
Yes, you are, indeed. Must be the fertiliser
that I gave you for luncheon.

38:08.782 --> 38:11.698
Maybe you should go out
and say something to him.

38:16.743 --> 38:19.411
- Guys.
- Maybe he'll just walk on by.

38:23.371 --> 38:24.699
Guys !

38:25.830 --> 38:27.324
Here.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.367
You are all looking quite well this evening.

38:35.417 --> 38:37.041
Will you be quiet?

38:37.793 --> 38:38.887
Mm.

38:47.922 --> 38:52.498
It was strange seeing Sara's name
in the papers after all those years.

38:52.549 --> 38:57.255
Your name was in the paper, too.
How did you know where Sara was buried?

38:59.218 --> 39:00.795
I didn't.

39:01.886 --> 39:06.212
Why did you tell that fellow
that I was gonna hurt you, or rather, Sara?

39:06.262 --> 39:09.925
- How did you figure that it was me?
- I didn't.

39:19.059 --> 39:21.809
"Woman On The Beach."

39:24.144 --> 39:26.894
It's a bit over dramatic, don't you think?

39:30.230 --> 39:32.186
Perhaps.

39:35.482 --> 39:37.687
You did a lot of work.

40:00.950 --> 40:03.107
You look like her, you know.

40:03.159 --> 40:05.565
You even move like her.

40:05.618 --> 40:09.993
She refused me. Even after I saved
her father's precious reputation,

40:10.036 --> 40:13.238
still she wanted to run off with Clay.

40:19.165 --> 40:21.405
I should've killed him, too.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.678
Put it on.

41:28.524 --> 41:30.599
Put it on.

41:49.907 --> 41:54.033
'If Lisa was trying to flush the murderer out,
she was doing a good job.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.826
'Maybe too good.'

41:59.578 --> 42:01.071
Sarah !

42:01.120 --> 42:02.744
Damn. Lisa !

42:02.787 --> 42:04.862
Lisa !

42:05.955 --> 42:08.030
Rick.

42:10.582 --> 42:14.791
- Ellison was here.
- You don't think he'll kill her?

42:28.214 --> 42:31.462
We played here every weekend,
even during the war.

42:34.049 --> 42:36.336
You were very good.

42:38.759 --> 42:41.509
I can't let you marry Clay.

42:47.388 --> 42:48.667
But I...

42:48.721 --> 42:52.669
I don't want to marry Clay.

43:08.687 --> 43:11.224
I'm not that crazy.

43:13.147 --> 43:14.724
Lisa.

43:17.441 --> 43:19.515
no !

43:27.736 --> 43:29.811
Oh !

44:31.052 --> 44:33.126
Agh ! no !

44:43.473 --> 44:46.223
It's me, it's Rick. Thomas, over here !

44:56.728 --> 44:59.561
- Rick, you OK?
- I'm OK. I'm fine.

45:20.237 --> 45:22.524
Come on, Higgie baby, cheer up.

45:22.571 --> 45:25.855
- Yeah. Have another drink.
- I don't want another drink.

45:25.906 --> 45:29.771
You know, Magnum,
you spend your life developing a craft,

45:29.824 --> 45:32.111
creative sensibilities, taste,

45:32.158 --> 45:36.070
only to have some Philistine
crush you with a whim.

45:36.118 --> 45:40.065
Come on, I thought she was...
What did you call it? Patroness?

45:41.203 --> 45:44.321
Lydia Shaftsbury is a vulgarian. A Visigoth.

45:45.371 --> 45:48.821
Whoever heard of playing
Romeo And Juliet as Samoans?

45:49.957 --> 45:51.616
Sounds interesting to me.

45:51.666 --> 45:54.949
- Got me off the hook.
- Yes, that's all you care about.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.581
The play is universal.
It should work anywhere.

45:58.627 --> 46:02.207
I am not staging Shakespeare
in grass skirts and lava-lavas.

46:04.796 --> 46:06.621
Good night.

46:08.547 --> 46:10.254
Psst.

46:10.298 --> 46:12.917
What's a vulgarian Visigoth?

46:15.508 --> 46:17.499
Be careful, please.

46:17.500 --> 46:20.050
What are you doing here?
What happened to the rehearsal?

46:20.051 --> 46:22.208
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey, TC.

46:22.260 --> 46:25.710
Oh, the writer and the producer
had creative differences.

46:27.054 --> 46:29.378
Kemo, bring us a drink.

46:30.764 --> 46:32.921
Gotta know something.

46:32.973 --> 46:34.881
Why didn't you just tell the police

46:34.932 --> 46:37.848
- where Sara was buried?
- Yeah.

46:37.891 --> 46:40.511
Because I didn't know
where Sara was buried.

46:41.601 --> 46:47.387
You mean, dropping the scarf
in the potting shed was just an accident?

46:47.437 --> 46:50.305
I was never near the potting shed, Magnum.

46:51.605 --> 46:53.596
Whoa. Wait a minute.

46:53.647 --> 46:55.852
You mean to tell me

46:55.898 --> 47:00.522
you didn't dress up like Sara
and talk to Thomas at the Clifford estate?

47:00.567 --> 47:02.605
- Yes, I did.
- Hal

47:02.651 --> 47:06.480
But I was never at the potting shed.

47:06.527 --> 47:09.479
- Or the tennis court?
- Or the tennis court.

47:09.528 --> 47:13.109
- Or the hothouse?
- Or the hothouse.

47:14.447 --> 47:16.438
Until Ellison chased me into it.

47:21.741 --> 47:26.733
Oooh-wheeee-oooh.

47:26.785 --> 47:30.234
I've had enough ghost stories for this week.
Good night.

47:30.286 --> 47:32.242
- Magnum, Magnum, Magnum.
- Lisa.

47:32.287 --> 47:37.160
- You've got to stop playing these games.
- I'm not.

47:40.582 --> 47:44.245
'It was understandable Lisa wanted
to keep the ghost story going.

47:44.291 --> 47:46.532
'Stuff like that helps sell books.

47:46.584 --> 47:52.002
'But I was a big boy, and like Higgins,
didn't believe in the nether world.'
