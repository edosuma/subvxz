I suppose you think
that's very funny, Harold.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.623
- Hello?
- Hello?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.124
- Fay?
- Yes?

04:52.292 --> 04:56.212
Darling, be a dear and cancel
my appointment with René this afternoon.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.010
I know he'll be furious...

05:03.136 --> 05:05.304
but I've had such a trying day.

05:05.472 --> 05:09.308
And with guests coming this evening.
Oh, would you? That's sweet.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.647
Tell him I promise
to be in on Tuesday.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.024
Thank you, Fay.
You're a darling.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.652
Yes. Bye.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.737
Bye.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.452
Oh. Dinner at 8:00, Harold.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.831
And do try and be
a little more vivacious.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.347
Of course, you know, Harold's father
had a similar sense of the absurd.

05:48.515 --> 05:52.018
I remember once in Paris,
he just stepped out for cigarettes...

05:52.144 --> 05:54.687
and the next thing I knew,
he was arrested by the police...

05:54.813 --> 05:56.772
for floating nude down the Seine.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.483
Experimenting in river currents...

05:59.609 --> 06:01.777
with rubber water wings.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.196
Mauve ones.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.450
Well, that cost quite a bit of
influence et d'argent...

06:07.576 --> 06:09.535
to hush up, I can tell you.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.537
Harold, dear,
don't play with your food.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.292
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

06:19.129 --> 06:21.047
I have a sore throat.

06:21.173 --> 06:24.633
Oh. Well, now,
directly after dinner...

06:24.760 --> 06:26.719
I want you to go straight to bed.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.056
Harold's always been
a very delicate child.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.892
Even as a baby.
He seemed totally prone...

06:33.060 --> 06:35.227
to every possible kind of illness.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.397
Harold, dear, eat up your beets.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.358
I remember once in Tokyo...

06:41.485 --> 06:43.486
I had to call the embassy
for a doctor.

07:05.217 --> 07:08.260
Oh, my God!

07:09.763 --> 07:12.932
This is too much!

07:13.058 --> 07:18.020
I can't stand much more of this!

07:18.146 --> 07:20.981
I can't take any more!

07:21.108 --> 07:24.318
Oh, my God!

07:27.239 --> 07:29.156
Oh, God!

07:31.785 --> 07:34.161
That's very interesting, Harold...

07:34.287 --> 07:36.789
and I think very illuminating.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.126
There seems to be
a definite pattern emerging.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.796
And of course,
this pattern, once isolated...

07:43.922 --> 07:45.840
can be coped with.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.509
Recognize the problem
and you're halfway on the road...

07:48.635 --> 07:50.553
to its... its solution.

07:52.681 --> 07:56.684
Tell me, Harold,
what do you do for fun?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.811
What activity gives you...

07:58.937 --> 08:02.189
a different sense of enjoyment
from the others?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.650
What do you find fulfilling?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.652
What gives you that...

08:06.820 --> 08:09.613
special satisfaction?

for he has established it
upon the waters...

09:47.212 --> 09:49.088
and set it firmly upon the rivers.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.272
He shall receive

Harold?

10:52.152 --> 10:56.739
Why you purchased
that monstrosity I have no idea.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.991
You can have any car you want.

10:59.117 --> 11:03.162
But that ugly black horror
is an eyesore and an embarrassment.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.415
Really, Harold,
it is time you settled down...

11:06.541 --> 11:10.002
and stopped flitting away your talents
on these little amateur theatrics...

11:10.128 --> 11:13.005
these little divertissements...

11:13.131 --> 11:15.799
no matter how psychologically
purging they may be.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.219
I don't know what to do.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.684
Go and have a talk
with your Uncle Victor.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.354
Perhaps he can fathom you.

11:28.521 --> 11:32.608
After all, he was
General MacArthur's right-hand man.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.241
Well, what do you say, Harold?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.537
It's a great life.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.165
There's action, adventure, advising...

11:48.291 --> 11:51.543
and you'll get a chance
to see the war firsthand.

11:52.754 --> 11:56.048
And there are plenty of slant-eyed girls.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.425
It'll make a man
out of you, Harold.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.470
You'll travel the world, put on a uniform,
and take on a man's job.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.226
You'll walk tall, with a glint in your eye
and a spring in your step...

12:07.394 --> 12:09.895
and the knowledge in your heart...

12:10.021 --> 12:12.898
that you are working for peace...

12:13.024 --> 12:15.442
and are serving your country...

12:15.568 --> 12:18.737
- just like Nathan Hale!
- Ready!

12:18.905 --> 12:20.739
Now, that's what this country needs...

12:20.907 --> 12:24.034
More Nathan Hales.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.078
Fire!

12:30.667 --> 12:33.836
- Hup!
- Harold...

12:33.962 --> 12:35.838
I think I can see...

12:35.964 --> 12:40.092
a little Nathan Hale in you.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.764
Tell me, Harold...

14:08.890 --> 14:13.101
how many of these suicides have you performed?

14:13.228 --> 14:16.647
An accurate number
would be difficult to gauge.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.024
Well, just give me a rough estimate.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.651
- A rough estimate?
- Mm.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.446
I'd say...

14:24.572 --> 14:25.864
fifteen.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.867
- Fifteen?
- That's a rough estimate.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.703
Were they all done
for your mother's benefit?

14:31.829 --> 14:34.039
No. No.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.291
I would not say "benefit."

14:36.417 --> 14:39.211
Harold, I only have
a few minutes, dear...

14:39.337 --> 14:42.089
and I do want
to inform you of my decision.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.386
You have led
a very carefree, idle...

14:47.554 --> 14:50.847
happy life up to the present...
the life of a child.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.850
But it is time now
to put away childish things...

14:53.977 --> 14:56.562
and take on adult responsibilities.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.897
Oh, we would all like
to sail through life...

14:59.023 --> 15:01.400
with no thought of tomorrow,
but that cannot be.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.527
We have our duties...

15:03.653 --> 15:06.363
our obligations, our principles.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.448
In short, Harold...

15:08.575 --> 15:11.243
I think it is time
for you to get married.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.551
Let us pray to the Lord, king of glory...

15:27.677 --> 15:31.680
that he may bless and deliver
the souls of all faithful departed...

15:31.806 --> 15:35.100
from the pain of hell
and the bottomless pit.

15:35.268 --> 15:39.271
Deliver them from the lion's mouth
and the darkness therein...

15:39.439 --> 15:42.232
and rather bring them to...

15:42.358 --> 15:46.445
the blessing of light,
holy life, and eternal rest.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.116
"O Lord..."

15:51.242 --> 15:54.494
do not bring your servant to trial...

15:54.621 --> 15:57.497
for no man...

15:57.624 --> 16:00.292
Becomes holy in your sight
unless you grant him...

16:00.418 --> 16:02.669
forgiveness of all his sins.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.464
We implore you therefore,
do not let the verdict...

16:05.590 --> 16:07.966
of your judgment go against him...

16:08.092 --> 16:10.052
Whom the loyal prayer of Christian faith
commends to your mercy.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.055
- Psst!
- Rather...

16:13.181 --> 16:15.098
by the help of your grace,
may he escape...

16:15.224 --> 16:18.101
the sentence which he deserves,
for during...

16:18.227 --> 16:21.813
his earthly life, he was signed
with the seal of the Holy Trinity.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.733
You who live...

16:24.859 --> 16:27.653
and reign forever and ever.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.613
"Amen."

16:29.739 --> 16:31.114
Psst!

16:32.909 --> 16:34.618
Like some licorice?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.662
- No, thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.671
♪ ♪ Did you know him?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.964
- No.
- Me neither.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.343
I heard he's 80 years old.
I'll be 80 next week.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.429
Good time
to move on, don't you think?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.515
I don't know.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.769
Well, I mean, 75 is too early...

17:00.895 --> 17:04.356
but at 85 you're just marking time.

17:04.523 --> 17:08.109
You may as well look over the horizon.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.492
Tsk.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.204
I'll never understand
this mania for black.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.540
Nobody sends
black flowers, do they?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.666
Black flowers are dead flowers.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.294
Who sends dead flowers
to a funeral?

17:26.421 --> 17:29.047
It's absurd.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.402
- What is your name?
- Harold. Harold Chasen.

17:50.528 --> 17:54.614
Oh, how do you do? I'm Dame Marjorie Chardin,
but you may call me Maude.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.117
- How do you do? Nice to meet you.
- Well, thank you.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.537
I think we're going to be
great friends, don't you?

18:00.663 --> 18:02.414
Can I give you a lift, Harold?

18:02.540 --> 18:05.083
No, thank you.
I have my own car.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.920
Well, I must be off.
We shall have to meet again.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.678
Tell me, do you dance?

18:16.804 --> 18:20.140
- Pardon me?
- Do you sing and dance?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.726
- Uh, no.
- "Uh, no."

18:22.852 --> 18:25.187
I thought not.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.786
That woman... she took my car!

18:43.456 --> 18:45.874
I have here, Harold,
the form sent out...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.959
by the National Computer
Dating Service.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.712
They screen out
the fat and the ugly...

18:50.838 --> 18:53.381
so it is obviously
a firm of high standards.

18:53.508 --> 18:56.426
First, here is
the personality interview...

18:56.552 --> 18:58.637
which you are to fill out
and return.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.473
Now, then, are you ready, Harold?

19:01.641 --> 19:04.100
Here is the first question.

19:04.227 --> 19:07.354
"Are you uncomfortable
meeting new people?"

19:07.480 --> 19:10.565
Well, I think that's a yes.
Don't you agree, Harold?

19:10.691 --> 19:14.402
"Should sex education
be taught outside the home?"

19:14.529 --> 19:16.446
Oh, I would say no.
Wouldn't you, Harold?

19:16.572 --> 19:18.990
Yeah, we'll give a D there.
Three:

19:19.158 --> 19:22.994
"Should women run for president
of the United States?"

19:23.120 --> 19:25.831
I don't see why not.
Absolutely yes.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.959
"Do you remember jokes
and take pleasure...

19:29.085 --> 19:31.211
in relating them to others?"

19:31.337 --> 19:33.296
You don't do that,
do you, Harold?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.507
No. Absolutely no.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.844
"Do you often get the feeling
that perhaps life isn't worth living?"

19:38.970 --> 19:43.306
Mm? What do you think, Harold?
A? B?

19:43.432 --> 19:46.184
Oh, we'll put down C...
"not sure."

19:46.352 --> 19:49.187
"Is the subject of sex
being overexploited...

19:49.313 --> 19:51.231
by our mass media?"

19:51.357 --> 19:53.859
Well, that would have to be yes,
wouldn't it?

19:54.026 --> 19:57.529
"Is it difficult for you
to accept criticism?"

19:57.655 --> 20:00.365
No. We'll mark D.

20:00.491 --> 20:04.202
"Do you sometimes have headaches
or backaches after a difficult day?"

20:04.328 --> 20:06.788
Yes, I do indeed.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.999
"Do you go to sleep easily?"

20:09.125 --> 20:11.042
I'd say so.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.753
"Do you believe
in capital punishment for murder?"

20:13.880 --> 20:15.755
Oh, yes, I do indeed.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.759
"In your opinion, are social affairs
usually a waste of time?"

20:19.886 --> 20:21.887
Heavens no!

20:23.055 --> 20:25.765
"Can God influence our lives?"

20:25.892 --> 20:29.144
Oh, yes. Absolutely yes.

20:29.270 --> 20:33.607
"Does your personal religion
or philosophy include a life after death?"

20:33.733 --> 20:35.317
Oh, yes indeed.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.612
That's absolutely.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.574
"Did you enjoy life
when you were a child?"

20:42.742 --> 20:46.620
Oh, yes.
You were a wonderful baby, Harold.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.415
"Do you think the sexual revolution
has gone too far?"

20:50.541 --> 20:53.585
It certainly has.

20:53.711 --> 20:58.006
"Do you find the idea
of wife-swapping distasteful?"

20:58.132 --> 21:01.259
I even find the question distasteful.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.887
"Do you..."

21:05.890 --> 21:07.599
Harold, please!

21:09.226 --> 21:12.938
"Do you have ups and downs
without obvious reason?"

21:13.064 --> 21:15.982
That's you, Harold.

My boy, excuse me.

23:39.502 --> 23:42.087
One moment, please.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.255
Who was that old lady
who was waving to you earlier?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.926
Hello, Harold.
Can I give you a lift?

23:48.052 --> 23:49.928
Oh, there you are, madam.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.263
Were you not the lady
who drove my car off yesterday?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.808
Was that the one with the Saint Christopher
medal on the dashboard?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.810
- Yes.
- Then I suppose it was me.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.561
Get in, Harold.

23:58.687 --> 24:02.107
Were you also the one
who painted the saint?

24:02.233 --> 24:04.609
Oh, yes. How did you like that?

24:04.777 --> 24:07.278
- Well, I didn't.
- Oh, don't be too discouraged.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.782
For aesthetic appreciation,
always a little time.

24:19.542 --> 24:22.627
What a delight it is, Harold,
to bump into you again.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.380
I knew we were gonna be
good friends the moment I saw you.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.590
You go to funerals often,
don't you?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.759
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so do I.

24:29.885 --> 24:34.139
They're such fun, aren't they?
It's all change, all revolving.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.474
Burials and births,
one linked to the other.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.810
The great circle of life.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.940
Hey, this old thing handles well.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.609
- Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
- Yeah.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.487
Well, it's a new experience for me.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.284
Good on curves.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.286
Shall I take you home, Harold?

24:56.412 --> 24:58.705
This is my car.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.249
- Your hearse?
- "Yearse."

25:07.631 --> 25:10.341
Then you shall take me home.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.400
So just before he left
for the monastery in Tibet...

25:27.526 --> 25:29.611
Big Sweeney gave me his keys.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.905
'Course, I had to make
some additions for the new models...

25:32.031 --> 25:34.032
but not as many as you might think.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.286
Once you have your basic set,
it's then only a question of variation.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.040
You hop in any car you want
and just drive off?

25:42.166 --> 25:44.459
Oh, not any car.
I like to keep a variety.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.544
I'm always looking
for the new experience.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.965
Maybe.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.718
Nevertheless,
I think you're upsetting people.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.762
I don't know if that's right.

25:57.306 --> 26:01.017
Well, if some people get upset because
they feel they have a hold on some things...

26:01.143 --> 26:03.228
I'm merely acting
as a gentle reminder...

26:03.354 --> 26:06.564
here today, gone tomorrow,
so don't get attached to things.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.025
Now, with that in mind...

26:09.151 --> 26:11.736
I'm not against collecting stuff.

26:11.862 --> 26:15.698
I've collected
quite a lot of stuff in my time.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.245
This is all memorabilia...

26:20.412 --> 26:24.082
but it's incidental, not integral,
if you know what I mean.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.834
The birds.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.504
Oh, I love them so much.

26:29.630 --> 26:32.840
They're the only wildlife
I get to see anymore.

26:32.967 --> 26:36.386
Me. Free as a bird.

26:38.639 --> 26:42.600
You know, at one time I used to break
into pet shops to liberate the canaries.

26:42.726 --> 26:46.062
But I decided that was an idea
way before its time.

26:46.188 --> 26:50.108
Zoos are full.
Prisons are overflowing.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.527
Oh, my.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.696
How the world still...

26:54.822 --> 26:57.115
dearly loves a cage.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.284
Please sit down, Harold.

26:59.451 --> 27:03.121
I'll put the kettle on.
We'll have a nice hot cup of tea.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.290
Oh, thank you,
but I really have to go.

27:05.457 --> 27:09.043
Oh, but it's oat straw tea.
You've never had oat straw tea, have you?

27:09.169 --> 27:11.504
- No.
- Well, then.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.299
No, but I really do have to go.
I have an appointment.

27:14.466 --> 27:18.678
- I really can't miss it.
- Oh. At the dentist?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.140
Kind of.

27:23.434 --> 27:26.144
Well, then, you'll just have
to come back and visit.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.439
- All right.
- My door's always open.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.733
- All right.
- Promise?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.526
I promise.

27:36.864 --> 27:38.823
Harold?

27:39.992 --> 27:41.659
Harold?

27:42.995 --> 27:45.872
I asked,
"Do you have any friends?"

27:45.998 --> 27:48.916
- No.
- None at all?

27:49.043 --> 27:50.918
No.

27:51.045 --> 27:53.129
Maybe one.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.465
Would you care
to talk about this friend?

27:55.591 --> 27:57.383
No.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.677
I find you a very
interesting case, Harold...

27:59.803 --> 28:03.806
but this reluctance on your part
is detrimental to the psychoanalytical process.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.017
Do you understand?

28:09.646 --> 28:11.773
Very well.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.359
Your mother tells me, Harold,
that she's arranging...

28:14.526 --> 28:17.612
several dates for you
with some young ladies.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.281
How do you feel about that?

28:26.288 --> 28:28.039
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.958
How do you do? I'm Mrs. Chasen.
Do come in.

28:31.085 --> 28:33.878
Harold is out in the garden, Candy,
but he'll be here in a moment.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.672
Shall we sit down?

28:36.799 --> 28:39.967
Oh, there's Harold. Hello.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.144
- Oh, he seems very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.230
You are at the university?

28:52.356 --> 28:55.066
- Yes, I am.
- And what are you studying?

28:55.192 --> 28:57.402
Poli sci with a minor in home ec.

28:57.528 --> 29:00.488
- "Poli sci"?
- Political science.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.408
- Oh.
- It's all about what's going on.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.744
Is Harold interested
in what's going on?

29:06.912 --> 29:09.247
I just think it's such
a super thing to study.

29:09.373 --> 29:12.375
And then, of course, I can always
fall back on my home ec.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.544
- Oh, now, that's good planning.
- Yes.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.922
Tell me, Candy, are you a regular
with this computer club?

29:18.048 --> 29:21.426
Oh, heavens no!
I don't have to worry about dates.

29:23.846 --> 29:27.306
But, you see, some of the other girls
in my sorority decided...

29:27.433 --> 29:30.268
that somebody ought to try it,
so we drew straws and I lost.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.939
Oh, but I... I'm looking forward
to meeting Harold.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.733
Well, I think
I should mention, Candy...

29:37.860 --> 29:40.319
Harold does have
his little eccentric moments.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.779
That's all right.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.199
I have a brother
who's a real cutup too.

29:45.325 --> 29:48.035
Oh, I will never forget the time...

29:48.162 --> 29:51.289
we had this old television set
with no parts in it.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.000
Tommy stuck his head behind it...

29:54.126 --> 29:58.045
and started giving a whole newscast
before the entire family.

29:58.172 --> 30:01.966
Must've been very funny.

30:02.092 --> 30:04.969
Harold!

30:05.137 --> 30:07.555
Oh, yes, dear.
Here is Harold now.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.682
Harold, this is Candy.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.810
Candy's just been telling us
such a funny little story...

30:12.936 --> 30:15.855

31:13.330 --> 31:15.873
I'm sorry.
I was looking for Maude.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.750
Harold?

31:23.674 --> 31:25.341
Maude.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.762
How about some ginger pie?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.640
- Fine. Thank you.
- I'll heat some up.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.688
My, Harold,
I'm glad to see you again.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.982
Do you often model for Glaucus?

31:41.108 --> 31:43.901
Oh, heavens, no.
I don't have the time.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.903
But I like to keep in practice.

31:46.071 --> 31:50.157
And poor Glaucus occasionally
needs his memory refreshed...

31:50.284 --> 31:53.202
as to the contours
of the female form.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.582
- Do you disapprove?
- Me? No. Of course not.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.588
Really? Do you think it's wrong?

32:14.600 --> 32:18.019
- No.
- Oh, heavens, I'm glad you said that.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.771
I want to show you my painting.

32:20.897 --> 32:24.108
This is The Rape of Rome.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.862
Over in the corner is
Leda and the Swan.

32:27.988 --> 32:30.281
A self-portrait.

32:30.407 --> 32:33.117
And over here is my favorite.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.288
It's titled...

32:37.414 --> 32:39.957
Rainbow with Egg Underneath...

32:40.125 --> 32:42.293
and an Elephant.

32:42.419 --> 32:45.421
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yeah. Very much.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.590
I then became infatuated...

32:47.716 --> 32:50.301
with these, my odorifics.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.303
"Give the nose a treat,"
I thought.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.097
"Have a kind of a...
of a olfactory banquet."

32:55.223 --> 32:58.225
Roast beef, old books...

32:58.352 --> 33:01.312
mown grass,
and Mexican farmyard.

33:01.438 --> 33:03.564
Oh! Here's one you'll like.

33:03.690 --> 33:07.652
Snowfall on 42nd Street.
I'll put it on.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.948
Now, you hold on to this.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.992
I'll pump it up.

33:16.620 --> 33:19.830
Okay. Now, hold it up there.

33:19.956 --> 33:22.041
Now, what do you smell?

33:26.755 --> 33:30.007
Subways?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.223
Perfume.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.231
Cigarettes.

33:52.906 --> 33:55.866
- Snow.
- Snow.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.994
Oh, it goes on and on.

33:59.121 --> 34:01.038
That's just great.

34:01.164 --> 34:04.208
But then I decided to switch...

34:04.334 --> 34:06.419
to the tactile.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.716
- What do you think?
- I like this.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.009
Oh, no, no, no.
Really get close...

34:14.136 --> 34:17.054
and reach in and feel.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.639
Oh. There's my kettle.

34:19.766 --> 34:23.226
Well, stroke...

34:23.353 --> 34:25.062
palm...

34:25.230 --> 34:27.063
caress...

34:27.232 --> 34:29.150
explore.

35:10.734 --> 35:14.445
Here we are:
Oat straw tea and ginger pie.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.950
Excuse the mismatched saucers.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.454
This is definitely
a new experience for me.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.957
Oh, wonderful.
Try something new each day.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.043
After all, we're given life
to find it out.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.045
It doesn't last forever.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.088
You look as if you could.

35:35.050 --> 35:39.136
- Did I tell you I'll be 80 on Saturday?
- You don't look 80.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.139
Oh, well, that's the influence
of the right food, right exercises...

35:42.265 --> 35:44.141
and the right breathing.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.352
Greet the dawn
with the Breath of Fire.

35:56.530 --> 35:59.698
Oh!

35:59.825 --> 36:02.827
Well, there's no question
my body's giving out.

36:02.953 --> 36:06.831
I'm well into autumn.
It's all gonna be over after Saturday.

36:06.957 --> 36:08.707
Tell me about yourself.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.836
What do you do
when you aren't visiting funerals?

36:20.387 --> 36:24.515
Yep. There is definitely
a certain attraction.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.614
I ask you though, Harold:

36:40.740 --> 36:42.700
Is it enough?

36:43.910 --> 36:47.079
- What do you mean?
- Well...

36:50.375 --> 36:52.543
Mm.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.755
I like to watch things grow.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.433
They grow and bloom...

37:07.559 --> 37:09.894
and fade and die...

37:10.020 --> 37:12.563
and change into something else.

37:14.316 --> 37:17.401
Life.

37:17.569 --> 37:21.614
I should like to change
into a sunflower most of all.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.159
They're so tall and simple.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.286
What flower would you like to be?

37:28.246 --> 37:30.122
I don't know.

37:31.541 --> 37:34.418
- One of these, maybe.
- Why do you say that?

37:36.463 --> 37:40.424
- Because they're all alike.
- Oh, but they're not.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.301
Look. See?

37:42.427 --> 37:45.387
Some are smaller,
some are fatter...

37:45.513 --> 37:48.390
some grow to the left,
some to the right.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.601
Some even have lost some petals.

37:50.769 --> 37:54.271
All kinds of observable differences.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.065
You see, Harold...

37:56.191 --> 37:59.568
I feel that much
of the world's sorrow...

37:59.694 --> 38:02.446
comes from people who are this...

38:03.949 --> 38:05.741
yet...

38:05.867 --> 38:08.577
allow themselves to be
treated as that.

Come on.

40:04.694 --> 40:07.446
Look at it. Oh!

40:07.572 --> 40:10.908
It's suffocating.
Well, it's the smog.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.411
You know, people can live with it,
but trees, it gives them asthma.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.413
They can't breathe.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.832
The leaves...
look, they're turning brown.

40:18.958 --> 40:22.628
Harold, we have got
to do something about this life.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.964
- What?
- We'll transplant it to the forest.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.383
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

40:28.510 --> 40:31.595
- This is public property.
- Well, exactly.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.390
Well, we'll need tools.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.601
You're right.
We'll go see Glaucus.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.561
Come on.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.939
Wait a minute.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.149
Oh, the police. Come on.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.865
Well, good afternoon, Officer.
Bit of trouble here?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.617
Yes, ma'am. Someone had
a little trouble parking.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.452
- It's a tricky turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

40:55.578 --> 40:57.621
Tell me, that car over there...

40:57.747 --> 40:59.790
is that parked all right?

40:59.916 --> 41:02.376
- Yes, ma'am. That's fine.
- Oh, thank you so much.

41:02.502 --> 41:06.130
You might turn the radio off.
Saves the battery.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.620
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.747
Thank you. I don't drink.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.417
Oh, it's all right.
It's organic.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.461
- Thanks.
- It has no nutritional value...

41:46.588 --> 41:50.507
but consistency
is not really a human trait.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.759
What is that up there?

41:52.886 --> 41:56.013
Oh, that's my umbrella.
That's just a relic.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.849
I found it when I was packing
to come to America.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.560
It used to be
my defense on picket lines...

42:01.686 --> 42:03.854
and rallies and political meetings...

42:04.022 --> 42:05.856
being dragged off by the police...

42:06.024 --> 42:08.525
and attacked by thugs
of the opposition.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.319
What were you fighting for?

42:10.445 --> 42:13.030
Oh, big issues:

42:13.156 --> 42:15.324
Liberty, rights, justice.

42:15.450 --> 42:18.911
Kings died. Kingdoms fell.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.205
I don't regret the kingdoms.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.457
What sense in...

42:23.583 --> 42:26.752
borders and nations
and patriotism?

42:28.296 --> 42:31.006
But I miss the kings.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.384
When I was a little girl...

42:34.552 --> 42:38.222
I was taken to the palace
in Vienna, to a garden party.

42:38.348 --> 42:41.308
I can still see the sun shining...

42:41.434 --> 42:43.310
the parasols...

42:43.436 --> 42:46.521
the flashing uniforms
of the young officers.

42:46.648 --> 42:49.399
I thought then that
I would marry a soldier.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.738
Later on,
Frederick would chide me about it.

42:56.658 --> 42:59.576
He was so serious.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.789
A doctor at the university...

43:03.915 --> 43:05.874
and in the government.

43:18.513 --> 43:21.598
But that was all before.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.110
So...

43:36.656 --> 43:38.740
you don't use
the umbrella anymore.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.080
No more revolts?

43:49.043 --> 43:50.919
Oh. Oh, yes.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.797
Oh, every day.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.632
But...

43:55.758 --> 43:57.884
I don't need a defense anymore.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.720
I embrace.

43:59.846 --> 44:02.389
Still fighting for the big issues...

44:02.515 --> 44:05.976
but now in my small...

44:06.144 --> 44:08.603
individual way.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.981
Shall we have a song?

44:11.107 --> 44:13.150
- I don't play anything.
- Oh, come on.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.610
- I'll show you.
- No...

- I don't play anything.
- Nothing?

46:12.395 --> 46:14.938
Dear me!

46:15.106 --> 46:17.441
Everybody should be able
to make some music.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.527
That's the cosmic dance.
Oh, come with me.

46:20.653 --> 46:23.321
There has to be something.

46:23.448 --> 46:26.283
Now, let me see.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.827
Wait a minute. See?

46:28.953 --> 46:30.912
Hold on to this. What is this?

46:31.038 --> 46:32.914
This is it. Here we are.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.834
Now, this is the one.
Take that.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.880
Just be impulsive. Be fanciful.
Let the music flow out of ya.

46:40.006 --> 46:42.466
You've got to make some chords.

46:42.592 --> 46:45.886
Put your finger
on the second fret there...

46:46.012 --> 46:48.597
then this one on the third,
then this one here.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.148
Harold!

47:01.903 --> 47:03.904
Harold?

47:06.240 --> 47:08.700
Harold, dear?

47:08.826 --> 47:10.869
Oh, there you are.

47:13.498 --> 47:16.708
I have a little surprise for you.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.793
It's a present.

47:23.508 --> 47:25.258
Come along.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.698
There.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.617
Isn't it darling?

47:51.702 --> 47:54.120
I had them take away
that monstrous thing of yours...

47:54.247 --> 47:56.331
and send this one 'round instead.

47:56.457 --> 47:59.000
So much more appropriate for you,
don't you think?

48:01.128 --> 48:03.046
Oh, one thing more, Harold.

48:03.172 --> 48:05.340
I telephoned your second
computer date this morning...

48:05.466 --> 48:08.218
and she seems
a very nice, quiet girl.

48:08.386 --> 48:10.220
Cute little thing, isn't it?

48:10.388 --> 48:12.681
I like it very much.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.188
Your license, lady.

49:02.315 --> 49:05.275
I don't have one.
I don't believe in them.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.529
How long you been drivin', lady?

49:09.655 --> 49:11.865
About 45 minutes.
Wouldn't you say, Harold?

49:11.991 --> 49:14.284
We were hoping
to start sooner, but you see...

49:14.410 --> 49:16.536
it's rather hard to find a truck.

49:16.662 --> 49:18.538
Is this your truck?

49:18.664 --> 49:21.458
No. I just took it.

49:21.584 --> 49:25.378
- You took it?
- Yes. You see, I have to plant my tree.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.631
Well, it's not mine, really...

49:27.798 --> 49:31.926
but we would like to get it into soil
as soon as possible.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.639
Let me get this straight, lady...

49:35.806 --> 49:37.307
All right, then. We'll be off.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.392
Nice chatting with you.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.150
- He was very nice.
- Oh, yeah.

50:01.082 --> 50:04.334
- I think he's following us.
- Is he?

50:04.502 --> 50:08.672
Tsk. Oh, the police.
Always wanting to play games.

50:22.144 --> 50:23.520
Hey, lady!

50:59.765 --> 51:01.891
Is the little tree all right?

51:04.311 --> 51:05.979
Oh, yeah. Fine.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.690
Terrific!

51:17.742 --> 51:19.743
There.

51:19.869 --> 51:24.164
Mm, I love the feel
of soil, don't you?

51:24.290 --> 51:26.249
And the smell.

51:28.002 --> 51:30.795
It's the earth.

51:30.921 --> 51:33.089
"The earth is my body...

51:33.215 --> 51:36.092
my head is in the stars."

51:36.260 --> 51:38.178
Who said that?

51:39.513 --> 51:42.098
I don't know.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.184
Well, I suppose I did.

51:46.979 --> 51:49.355
Ooh, isn't it wonderful?

51:49.482 --> 51:52.400
All around us, living things!

52:57.633 --> 52:59.801
All right, out, lady.

53:01.053 --> 53:04.097
- Come on.
- Hello. Haven't we met before?

53:04.223 --> 53:06.099
None of that, lady.
Come on out.

53:06.225 --> 53:10.144
Oh, well. It must've been your brother.
There is a family resemblance.

53:12.648 --> 53:13.857
Out of the car.

53:13.983 --> 53:16.025
Just stand over there, lady.
Just stand over there.

53:16.193 --> 53:18.152
Come on. Get out, buster!

53:18.279 --> 53:20.238
You're in a lot of trouble, lady.

53:20.364 --> 53:23.741
I got you down here
for several offenses, including...

53:23.868 --> 53:26.953
possession of a stolen vehicle,
resisting arrest...

53:27.079 --> 53:29.455
and possession of a stolen tree...
Where's the tree?

53:29.582 --> 53:31.875
- We planted it.
- You planted it.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.210
- Is this your shovel?
- No.

53:34.336 --> 53:37.881
Possession of a stolen shovel.

53:38.007 --> 53:40.675
Don't get officious.
You're not yourself when you're officious.

53:40.801 --> 53:43.761
That's the curse
of a government job.

53:49.852 --> 53:51.728
Oh, lady.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.316
Are you gonna take
a lot of time with this?

53:56.442 --> 53:58.526
- Lady, please?
- Because if you are...

53:58.652 --> 54:01.154
Will you be just quiet, please?

54:05.826 --> 54:07.952
Grab the shovel, Harold!

54:18.505 --> 54:21.382
Lady! Stop, or I'll have to shoot!

54:46.784 --> 54:48.952
I sure am picking up on vices.

54:50.245 --> 54:53.623
Vice, virtue.
It's best not to be too moral.

54:53.749 --> 54:55.750
You cheat yourself
out of too much life.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.794
Aim above morality.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.922
If you apply that to life...

55:01.048 --> 55:04.133
then you're bound to live it fully.

55:10.099 --> 55:12.016
I haven't lived.

55:15.813 --> 55:17.772
I've died a few times.

55:17.898 --> 55:19.315
What was that?

55:20.901 --> 55:23.444
Well...

55:24.655 --> 55:26.572
the first time...

55:27.658 --> 55:30.576
was when I was at boarding school
in the chemistry lab.

55:30.703 --> 55:32.620
I was in there cleaning it up...

55:33.664 --> 55:37.250
so I decided I'd do
a little experimenting, you know.

55:37.376 --> 55:40.670
So I get all this stuff out
and begin mixing it up.

55:40.796 --> 55:42.380
It was very scientific.

55:45.426 --> 55:47.969
There was this massive explosion.

55:48.095 --> 55:51.681
It knocked me down
and blew out a huge hole in the floor.

55:51.849 --> 55:56.019
There was boards and bricks
and flames leapin' up.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.813
I figured, you know...

55:58.939 --> 56:00.815
time to leave.

56:00.941 --> 56:04.193
My career in school was over.

56:04.319 --> 56:08.156
So I went home.

56:08.282 --> 56:10.450
My mother was giving a party,
so I just went...

56:10.576 --> 56:13.494
right up the back stairs
and to my room...

56:13.620 --> 56:16.414
turned out the light, and...

56:16.540 --> 56:18.916
I got this funny feeling.

56:20.127 --> 56:24.172
The doorbell rang.
I went out to the banister...

56:24.298 --> 56:27.175
and these two policemen came in...

56:27.301 --> 56:29.886
found my mother...

56:30.012 --> 56:33.056
and told her...

56:33.223 --> 56:36.559
that I was killed in the fire.

56:36.727 --> 56:40.146
She put one hand up
to her forehead.

56:40.272 --> 56:43.900
With the other she reached out
as if groping for support...

56:44.068 --> 56:47.779
and with this long sigh...

56:47.905 --> 56:51.324
she collapsed in their arms.

57:20.229 --> 57:22.855
I decided right then...

57:22.981 --> 57:25.441
that I enjoyed being dead.

57:26.485 --> 57:28.111
I understand.

57:28.278 --> 57:31.155
A lot of people enjoy being dead.

57:31.281 --> 57:33.282
But they're not dead, really.

57:33.450 --> 57:37.703
They're just backing away from life.

57:37.830 --> 57:40.456
Reach out. Take a chance.

57:41.542 --> 57:43.626
Get hurt, even.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.838
But play as well as ya can.

57:46.964 --> 57:49.423
Go, team, go!

57:49.550 --> 57:52.802
Give me an L, give me an I,
give me a V, give me an E.

57:52.928 --> 57:55.805
L-I-V-E, live!

57:57.474 --> 58:01.144
Otherwise you got nothin'
to talk about in the locker room.

58:11.905 --> 58:14.490
I like you, Maude.

58:15.659 --> 58:17.660
I like you, Harold.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.822
Harold is down at the garage.

58:54.948 --> 58:57.867
He has a new car,
and he's just been tuning it up.

58:57.993 --> 59:00.411
- He's very mechanical.
- What kind of car is it?

59:00.537 --> 59:03.497
- It's a little Jaguar.
- Oh.

59:05.667 --> 59:07.585
Looks like a hearse.

59:08.754 --> 59:11.631
Very nice. Compact.

59:11.757 --> 59:14.050
Edith, I'd like you to meet
my son, Harold.

59:14.218 --> 59:16.510
Harold, this is Edith...

59:16.637 --> 59:18.304
- Phern.
- Phern.

59:18.430 --> 59:20.306
Very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

59:20.432 --> 59:22.391
I think you should go
and wash up, dear...

59:22.517 --> 59:25.561
and join us in the drawing room.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.563
And what do you do, my dear?

59:27.689 --> 59:30.775
I'm a file clerk
at Harrison Feed and Grain.

59:30.901 --> 59:33.945
Well, what is it exactly
that you do?

59:34.071 --> 59:36.906
I'm in charge of all the invoices
for the southwest.

59:37.074 --> 59:40.243
- How interesting.
- We supply, for example...

59:40.369 --> 59:42.495
most of the egg farmers
in Petaluma.

59:42.621 --> 59:45.248
- So you can imagine.
- Yes.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.418
Oh, here's Harold now.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.587
Don't get up, dear.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.263
Edith has been talking about her job.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.474
- I'm a file clerk.
- Henderson Feed and Grain.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.726
Harrison.
Harrison Feed and Grain.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.728
It's at Hamilton and Fourth...

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.772
and I'm in charge of all the invoices.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.609
I type up the schedule
for the trucking fleet.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.612
She supplies the whole southwest
with chicken feed.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.407
Well, not exactly
the whole southwest...

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.701
although we do do
a large business.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.703
Barley was very big last week.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.497
Fifteen hundred... bushels.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.813
In view of
your recent actions, Harold...

01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:53.232
I find you have left me
with no recourse...

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.985
but to listen to the solution
proposed by your uncle.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:59.238
Consequently,
I have instructed him forthwith...

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:01.324
to induct you into the service...

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.077
and, for your own good,
to take up active duty...

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.705
with the United States Army.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:12.668
And I hope they have
more luck with you than I.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.506
Maude, they're gonna draft me.

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.717
Well, don't go.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.802
They'll put me in jail.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.722
Well, historically,
you'd be in very good company.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.980
Maude, can you help me?

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.524
Well, with your skill
and my experience...

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.027
I think we can come up
with something.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:41.781
Harold, I want you to look
at me like your father in this matter.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:45.034
Oh, I know you have no desire
to join the army, but once you're in...

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.536
you'll love it.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.039
It's a great life. Look at me.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:53.417
A chauffeur. Respect.
Money in the bank.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.255
Oh, it has its drawbacks,
like anything else, I suppose.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.299
But the army takes care of you.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:03.552
And you've got a buddy for life.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.057
Good idea comin' out here, Harold.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.810
- It's a lovely spot.
- Thank you, Uncle.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:14.397
Call me "sir," Harold.
It's the first thing you learn in the army.

01:02:14.523 --> 01:02:16.524
An officer deserves your respect.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.359
Yes, sir.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.904
Now, let's examine the facts on it.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.032
I say this country
has been too harsh...

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:28.160
in its outright condemnation of war.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:31.247
I say you can point to the many
material advantages brought about...

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:33.916
by a crisis-and-conflict policy.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:37.711
Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:40.464
During wartime,
the national suicide rate goes down.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.882
Is that a faCt?

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:45.594
Now, why in hell
did we give up on the Germans?

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.849
Since the damn politicians in Washington
chalked them up on our side...

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:52.768
the wars ever since
have been a national disgrace.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.603
Hell, look at history.

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:58.399
Why, the two best wars this country
ever fought were against the Jerries.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:01.444
I say get the Krauts on the other side
of the fence where they belong.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.737
Let's get back
to the kind of enemy worth killing...

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:06.615
and the kind of war
this whole country can support.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.243
That's pretty strong stuff, sir.

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:13.456
Well, Harold, I've always been
a man who speaks his piece.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:18.085
Oh, it's hurt me.
I'm not liked in Washington.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.254
I know that.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.882
But I do have friends in high places.

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:28.679
They kept falling. Zock!

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.599
Joe falls back, a neat red hole
in the middle of his head.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:35.811
Only one thing kept going through my mind:

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.647
"Kill! Kill! For Joe..."

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.192
and Mac and all
the rest of the guys.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.111
"Kill!" And then
there was a blinding flash!

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.785
And I woke up on the stretcher.

01:03:55.582 --> 01:03:58.083
"Did we hold?"
I asked the medic.

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.794
"Yes, sir!" he said.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:09.220
And I slipped
into unconsciousness.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.723
Boy!

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.684
That's a terrific story, sir.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.896
Well...

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.690
you'll have stories like that to tell
of your own someday, Harold.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.193
- Do you think so, sir?
- Sure, you will.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.988
Gee, I never dreamed
it could be that... exciting.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.699
It's the most exciting thing
in the world, Harold.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.201
To pit...

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.204
- your own life against another.
- Yes!

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.373
To kill.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.959
The taste of blood in your mouth.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.211
The moment of truth.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:45.214
Another man's life in your sights!

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.715
- Yes!
- Zat!

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.885
- Will they really teach me to shoot?
- Sure, they will. A variety of weapons.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.845
- To use a bayonet?
- Yes!

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:54.807
Hah!
How about hand-to-hand combat?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.560
- Yes.
- To strangle someone! Choke him!

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.187
Squeeze out his life
in your own bare hands!

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.189
I think you're getting
carried away, Harold.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:05.067
- How about to slit his throat?
- Well, I don't know about that.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.820
I'd like that. You could see the blood
squirt out. How about souvenirs?

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.738
- Souvenirs?
- Of your kill.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.908
Eyes, ears, nose, scalp, privates.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:15.578
- Harold!
- Hey, what would be the chance...

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:17.663
of getting one of these?

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.832
Boy, to think I could maybe
make my own!

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:23.127
- Harold, that's disgusting!
- It certainly is!

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:26.714
- Madam, who are you?
- I am petitioning for peace.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.173
- Parasite!
- Harold!

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.301
- And I came out here to speak.
- Crazy parasite!

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.928
- Harold!
- Commie bastard! Get the hell out of here!

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.638
Don't you talk to me like that...

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.849
- you little foulmouthed degenerate!
- Traitor! BenediCt Arnold!

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.643
- Remember Nathan Hale! Right, sir?
- Harold, calm down.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:43.147
- She's a commie pig!
- Don't you advance on me.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:44.773
You'll all end up like this!

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.109
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Just like this!

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:48.611
- Ooh, filth!
- Harold!

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.821
Ooh! Give me that.
I'm gonna throw that...

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.823
- in the sewer, where it belongs.
- Madam, please!

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.284
- She took my head.
- Calm down, Harold.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:58.287
- She took my head! I'll kill her!
- Calm down. Harold!

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:00.831
- I'll kill her!
- Harold!

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.958
Madam!

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.961
Give back the head.
Let's have no troubles. Harold!

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.839
Madam!

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.050
Harold! Damn you!

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.510
Just a minute!

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.888
You traitor!

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.641
- I'll kill you!
- Harold!

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:20.809
You commie bastard!

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:25.147
- I'll kill you! You...
- Harold!

01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:28.692
Stop it! Harold! Harold!

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.840
What have you done?

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:58.514
Maude?

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:03.686
Do you pray?

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.772
"Pray"? No.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:09.358
I communicate.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.485
With God?

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.487
With life.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:20.035
- This is real nice.
- Yeah.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.079
Makes me
want to do somersaults.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.958
- Well, why don't you?
- I'd feel stupid.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.502
Harold...

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.463
everyone has the right to make
an ass out of themselves.

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:34.591
You can't let the world
judge you too much.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:58.073
Do you care to join me
in a little cartwheel?

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.537
No, I feel more like yelling.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.444
And...

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.698
you're very beautiful.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:27.162
Oh, Harold.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:30.082
You make me feel
like a schoolgirl.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:42.176
Shall I come and visit you tomorrow?
Oh, I can't.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:46.348
I have a luncheon date...
with a girl.

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.852
- Oh.
- Well, I don't even know her.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.312
My mother arranged it.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.319
Look! Oh!

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:03.615
Dreyfus once wrote
from Devil's Island that he would see...

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.993
the most glorious birds.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:07.995
Many years later in Brittany...

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:12.374
he realized
they had only been seagulls.

Now, Harold, I cannot impress
upon you too strongly...

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.582
the importance of this meeting.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:58.086
This is the last girl, so kindly remember
that this is your third and final chance.

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:00.631
And please try
to be serious, Harold.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:03.508
If not for your sake,
at least for hers.

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:05.594
Oh, there she is.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.138
Sunshine, I'd like you
to meet Harold.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.474
Harold, this is Sunshine Doré.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.895
- Howdy... How do you do?
- Oh, I can't complain.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.065
Sunshine is an actress, Harold.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.943
- I like to think so.
- Mm, wonderful.

01:11:21.069 --> 01:11:24.029
Well, now, why don't you two
go along down...

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:26.615
to the music room,
and I'll follow on later with some drinks?

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:29.368
Oh, perhaps Starlight
would like a cigarette.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:33.205
- Ooh! "Sunshine."
- Oh, yes, of course.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.123
Sunshine.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:47.970
Ooh!

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.352
Would you like a cigarette?

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:58.647
No, thank you.
They stain my fingers.

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:01.900
Is Sunshine your real name?

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:06.154
Well, actually it was the name
of my drama teacher. Louis Sunshine.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.156
Perhaps you've heard of him.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.283
He was such an influence...

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:13.370
on the development
of my instrument.

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:16.957
That means "my body"
in theater talk.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:20.335
Doré is my real name.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:23.755
Well, Dorr, actually.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:28.510
Oh, my, what a lovely place
you have here!

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:40.022
Oh, do you play?

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:42.024
No.

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:45.193
I am learning the ba...
the harmonica.

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:50.449
Oh, is this your father?

01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:53.201
No. My Uncle Victor.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.746
He's in the army.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:13:00.125
I do so like the military,
don't you?

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:02.711
What a wonderful
collection of knives!

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:05.505
- May I see them?
- No, no, don't touch. They're very old.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.966
Do you enjoy knives?

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:09.718
Oh, yes.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.721
You might find this one
particularly interesting.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.057
It's a hara-kiri blade.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.393
What's hara-kiri?

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:39.099
Sukiyaki!

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.611
Harold!

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:55.407
Oh, that was marvelous!

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.243
Oh, it had the ring of truth!

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.996
I played Juliet...

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.290
in the Sunshine Playhouse.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.834
Louie thought it was
my best performance.

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.005
What's here?

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:14.134
A cup?
Closèd in my true love's hand?

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.846
Poison, I see...

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:22.267
hath been his timeless end.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:26.021
Oh, happy dagger...

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:30.066
Oh, happy dagger...

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.068
this is thy sheath.

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.196
There rest...

01:15:34.322 --> 01:15:38.450
And let me die!

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.877
I fall.

01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:03.558
Harold!

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:11.274
That was your last date!

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:50.313
That wasn't very scary.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:53.066
No. It had nothing
on this afternoon.

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.568
Oh, come on. You loved it.

01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:58.947
It was a new experience.

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:57.422
You sure have a way with people.

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:01.009
Well, they're my species.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.057
Look at these stars.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:08.975
Mm.

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.064
Maude?

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.149
Yes?

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:25.283
Here.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.369
A gift.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.668
"Harold loves Maude."

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:44.219
And Maude loves Harold.

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:50.183
This is the nicest present...

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:52.685
that I've received in years.

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:06.741

Oh, could I speak with Fay, please?

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:14.350
Fay? Darling, I know
René will be furious, but...

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:17.312
Well, if he knew what I had
to put up with in the last few days...

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.314
- Mother?
- Not now, dear.

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:21.316
So could you put me down
for Monday?

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:24.611
- Mother, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- I'm on the phone, dear.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:28.323
- I'm getting married.
- What did you say?

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.826
I'm getting married.

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:36.247
Hold the line, Fay.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.335
To whom?

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:50.053
I suppose you think
this is very funny, Harold.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.096
A sunflower.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:01.189
You can't be serious!

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.550
Harold, your mother has spoken to me
about your marriage plan.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.553
And although normally
I have nothing against marriage...

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.763
- Troop...
- I don't think this is quite...

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.391
Normal.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.560
A very common neurosis...

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.187
particularly in this society...

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:44.566
whereby the male child
subconsciously...

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.360
wishes to sleep with his mother.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:49.862
Of course,
what puzzles me, Harold...

01:21:49.989 --> 01:21:52.907
is that you want to sleep
with your grandmother.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:56.244
I would be remiss in my duty...

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.121
if I did not tell you...

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:01.124
that the idea of...

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:05.587
intercourse...

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:10.633
the fact of your firm young...

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.304
body...

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:19.100
commingling...

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:22.854
with the...

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.106
withered flesh...

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:28.610
sagging...

01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:31.112
breasts...

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:34.324
and... flabby...

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:38.077
bu...

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:41.581
buttocks...

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.710
makes me want...

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:50.214
to vomit.

01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:52.258
Mm.

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.978
Oh, Harold!

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:07.982
It's dazzling.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.141
You've thought of everything.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.686
And champagne.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.771
It's all right. It's organic.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:50.358
Oh, Harold.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:56.239
For you.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.704
And...

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:06.207
after dinner...

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:15.091
one more little surprise...

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:21.097
that I hope
will make you very happy.

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:23.391
Oh, Harold.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.518
I am happy.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:35.611
I couldn't imagine
a lovelier farewell.

01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.534
