02:14.218 --> 02:15.719
Welcome, Lord Stark.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.931
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.016
The honour of your presence is requested.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.687
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.398
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

02:28.482 --> 02:32.027
If you'd like to change into something
more appropriate...

03:08.313 --> 03:10.566
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.778
About time we had
some stern northern leadership.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.698
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.783
Sturdy old thing.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.244
How many kings' arses
have polished it, I wonder?

03:22.369 --> 03:24.121
Um, what's the line?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.499
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.835
Very handsome armour.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.338
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

03:33.463 --> 03:37.009
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.803
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.056
I have a knack for it.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.313
It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.568
I was standing right here
when it happened.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.654
He was very brave, your brother.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.573
Your father, too.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.700
They didn't deserve to die like that.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.620
Nobody deserves to die like that.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.580
But you just stood there and watched.

04:06.663 --> 04:09.625
500 men just stood there and watched.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.377
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.838
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.466
No, Lord Stark.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.678
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.934
Except for the screams, of course,

04:27.059 --> 04:29.019
and the Mad King laughing.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.729
And later...

04:31.939 --> 04:34.399
when I watched the Mad King die,

04:34.483 --> 04:37.819
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

04:39.154 --> 04:40.822
it felt like justice.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.453
Is that what you tell yourself at night?

04:47.621 --> 04:50.374
You're a servant of justice?

04:50.499 --> 04:54.962
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

04:55.087 --> 04:59.842
Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly
instead of the back,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.718
would you admire me more?

05:02.803 --> 05:06.890
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.072
Lord Stark.

05:24.575 --> 05:25.993
Lord Varys.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.830
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles
on the Kingsroad.

05:29.872 --> 05:33.584
We are all praying
for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.920
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.341
Renly! You're looking well.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.135
And you look tired from the road.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.470
I told them this meeting could wait
another day, but...

05:45.554 --> 05:48.265
But we have a kingdom
to look after.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.476
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.063
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

05:55.147 --> 05:58.192
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.486
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...

06:01.612 --> 06:03.488
from navel to collarbone.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.657
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.576
It wasn't the man that I chose, my lord.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.995
It was Catelyn Tully.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.332
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.043
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.670
Grand Maester.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.048
How many years has it been?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.635
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

06:26.512 --> 06:29.181
Oh, how forgetful of me.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.018
This belongs to you now.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.481
Should we begin?

06:38.607 --> 06:40.526
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

06:40.651 --> 06:43.904
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.073
His Grace has many cares.

06:46.114 --> 06:50.827
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.747
We are the lords of small matters here.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.713
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

07:01.839 --> 07:04.216
in honour of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.886
- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

07:08.011 --> 07:09.555
20,000 to the runner-up,

07:09.638 --> 07:12.724
20,000 to the winning archer.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.143
Can the treasury bear such expense?

07:15.185 --> 07:18.105
I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters
will accommodate, I expect.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.400
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.392
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

07:23.402 --> 07:27.239
- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

07:27.322 --> 07:31.493
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.122
I will not believe Jon Arryn
allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.041
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice,

07:38.166 --> 07:41.879
but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.464
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.384
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.720
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.264
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.267
There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.316
Forgive me, my lords. I'm...

08:02.357 --> 08:06.820
- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.406
We serve at your pleasure.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.498
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

08:21.084 --> 08:24.463
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

08:24.505 --> 08:28.300
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

08:28.425 --> 08:32.095
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.847
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.976
That's not true. You killed the beast.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.270
You only spared the girl because of the love
your father bears her father.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.731
I didn't, I...

08:42.813 --> 08:47.528
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

08:47.611 --> 08:51.198
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.745
Do I have to marry her?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.706
Yes.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.959
She's very beautiful and young.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.337
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

09:05.462 --> 09:09.800
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

09:10.801 --> 09:14.847
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.474
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins,
so be it.

09:17.599 --> 09:21.770
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.693
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.611
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

09:30.612 --> 09:34.575
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.160
We allow the northerners too much power.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.705
They consider themselves our equals.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.331
How would you handle them?

09:42.457 --> 09:47.129
I'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.463
A royal army?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.382
Why should every lord
command his own men?

09:50.549 --> 09:52.676
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.846
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

09:55.929 --> 09:57.639
trained by experienced soldiers,

09:57.723 --> 10:01.351
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.812
And if the northerners rebel?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.522
I'd crush them.

10:05.647 --> 10:09.735
Seize Winterfell and install someone
loyal to the realm as warden of the North.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.236
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

10:11.361 --> 10:15.032
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

10:15.157 --> 10:17.326
- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.411
But you've just invaded their homeland,

10:19.578 --> 10:22.247
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.250
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.419
It's too big and too wild.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.203
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

10:29.213 --> 10:31.340
couldn't save you and your royal army.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.301
A good king knows
when to save his strength...

10:35.886 --> 10:38.305
and when to destroy his enemies.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.016
So you agree...

10:41.892 --> 10:43.393
the Starks are enemies?

10:45.938 --> 10:49.233
Everyone who isn't us...
is an enemy.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.988
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.074
- I'm practising.
- Practising for what?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.117
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

10:59.243 --> 11:02.371
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.789
The Hound killed your friend.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.333
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.856
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

11:08.877 --> 11:10.087
Mycah would be alive.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.588
Enough!

11:14.216 --> 11:15.884
What's happening here?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.220
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.266
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.817
That's for you, love.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.997
The same dollmaker
makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.458
Don't you like it?

11:49.293 --> 11:52.129
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.675
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.928
It's all right. Go on.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.231
War was easier than daughters.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.363
Go away!

12:18.488 --> 12:20.949
Arya, open the door.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.170
May I come in?

12:39.635 --> 12:42.387
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.181
Give it to me.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.732
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.694
Where did you get this?

13:01.657 --> 13:03.867
This is no toy.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.705
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.749
And I don't want to be a lady.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.085
Come here.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.634
Now what do you want with this?

13:20.759 --> 13:23.095
It's called Needle.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.264
Oh, a blade with a name.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.934
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

13:29.101 --> 13:31.019
Your sister?

13:31.103 --> 13:33.397
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.274
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

13:35.399 --> 13:38.193
That's the essence of it.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.198
I was trying to learn.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.703
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.292
I asked him. It was my fault.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.589
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

14:00.549 --> 14:03.135
I hate them. I hate all of them.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.512
The Hound, the queen and the king

14:05.596 --> 14:07.181
and Joffrey and Sansa.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.933
Sansa was dragged
before the king and queen...

14:10.976 --> 14:13.562
and asked to call the prince a liar.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.190
So was I! He is a liar.

14:16.315 --> 14:18.317
Shh, darling, listen to me.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.446
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.199
She cannot betray him.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.951
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.914
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

14:33.916 --> 14:35.709
Well...

14:37.419 --> 14:39.838
Look at me.

14:39.922 --> 14:43.091
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

14:45.511 --> 14:46.720
Winter is coming.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.892
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.353
But now winter is truly coming.

14:54.478 --> 14:58.440
And in the winter
we must protect ourselves,

14:58.524 --> 14:59.900
look after one another.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.319
Sansa is your sister.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.781
I don't hate her.

15:06.490 --> 15:07.824
Not really.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.996
I don't want to frighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.541
We've come to a dangerous place.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.002
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.005
All right?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.342
Go on. It's yours.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.514
I can keep it?

15:31.515 --> 15:33.559
Try not to stab your sister with it.

15:42.484 --> 15:46.446
If you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

15:54.204 --> 15:57.958
Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars.

16:00.085 --> 16:04.089
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.301
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.013
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.015
Those were always your favourites.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.392
Those weren't my favourites.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.020
My favourites were the scary ones.

16:19.354 --> 16:23.609
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

16:24.943 --> 16:26.945
Fear is for the winter

16:27.029 --> 16:30.282
when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.

16:30.407 --> 16:34.828
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

16:34.953 --> 16:39.917
and children are born and live and die,
all in darkness.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.670
That is the time for fear, my little lord,

16:43.754 --> 16:46.965
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

16:48.425 --> 16:53.680
Thousands of years ago there came a night
that lasted a generation.

16:53.764 --> 16:56.642
Kings froze to death in their castles,

16:56.767 --> 16:58.894
same as the shepherds in their huts.

16:58.977 --> 17:03.732
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

17:03.815 --> 17:08.153
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.781
So is this the sort of story that you like?

17:15.243 --> 17:19.540
In that darkness, the white walkers
came for the first time.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.667
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

17:22.792 --> 17:24.877
riding their dead horses,

17:25.002 --> 17:28.799
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as hounds...

17:33.512 --> 17:35.180
What are you telling him now?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.599
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.310
Get your supper. I want some time with him.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.240
One time she told me

17:53.282 --> 17:55.534
the sky is blue
because we live inside the eye

17:55.617 --> 17:58.412
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.581
Maybe we do.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.127
How do you feel?

18:08.839 --> 18:10.841
You still don't remember anything?

18:12.843 --> 18:17.014
Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.932
In the wind, in the rain...

18:19.016 --> 18:21.101
A thousand times.

18:21.185 --> 18:23.437
- You never fall.
- I did though.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.692
It's true, isn't it,

18:28.859 --> 18:32.070
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.496
I'd rather be dead.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.043
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.265
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.476
But still too many.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.145
It's nine years since I've set foot
in the capital.

19:05.229 --> 19:08.482
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.571
My lady.

19:14.613 --> 19:17.824
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

19:17.950 --> 19:19.743
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.037
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.872
Instructed?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.583
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

19:26.708 --> 19:28.377
Follow me, Lady Stark.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.514
Cat!

19:40.597 --> 19:43.892
Go on. Go upstairs.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.772
You little worm!

19:48.939 --> 19:53.110
You take me for some back-alley Sally
you can drag into a...

19:55.112 --> 19:56.572
Pssst!

19:58.740 --> 20:03.078
I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

20:03.245 --> 20:07.207
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.825
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

20:09.835 --> 20:13.422
I'm truly sorry... about the locale.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.799
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

20:16.925 --> 20:18.844
A dear friend told me.

20:20.679 --> 20:23.432
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

20:23.557 --> 20:27.519
To see you again after so many years
is a blessing.

20:27.603 --> 20:28.979
Your poor hands.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.066
How did you know I was coming?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.569
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.865
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

20:41.533 --> 20:43.827
My little birds are everywhere...

20:43.911 --> 20:46.079
even in the North.

20:46.246 --> 20:49.666
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.049
Valyrian steel.

20:57.216 --> 20:59.927
Do you know whose dagger this is?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.639
I must admit I do not.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.226
Well, well, this is an historic day.

21:08.227 --> 21:11.563
Something you don't know that I do.

21:13.982 --> 21:17.778
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

21:19.363 --> 21:21.823
- It's mine.
- Yours?

21:21.990 --> 21:26.203
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.206
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

21:29.331 --> 21:31.083
as any sane man would.

21:31.166 --> 21:36.171
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him,
I lost this dagger.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.423
To whom?

21:38.507 --> 21:40.425
Tyrion Lannister.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.761
The Imp.

21:42.845 --> 21:45.472
Grenn, show him
what you farm boys are made of.

21:50.936 --> 21:53.730
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

21:53.814 --> 21:59.486
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.530
Pyp.

22:01.613 --> 22:05.617
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

22:13.709 --> 22:15.586
Next!

22:25.846 --> 22:27.764
Next!

22:40.777 --> 22:45.115
Well, Lord Snow, it appears
you're the least useless person here.

22:46.158 --> 22:47.367
Go clean yourselves up!

22:47.492 --> 22:50.245
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.748
A charming man.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.334
I don't need him to be charming.

22:55.501 --> 22:58.504
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

22:58.629 --> 23:00.047
into men of the Night's Watch.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.509
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

23:03.634 --> 23:05.135
Slowly.

23:07.471 --> 23:10.682
A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.064
Good news or bad?

23:17.189 --> 23:18.774
Both.

23:20.150 --> 23:23.362
Lord Stark.

23:23.445 --> 23:26.281
I meant...
to give you this earlier.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.577
So forgetful these days.

23:32.496 --> 23:35.207
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

23:45.926 --> 23:48.136
Good news?

23:51.723 --> 23:54.101
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.231
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

24:07.489 --> 24:09.575
Yes, I'm looking at you.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.913
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.791
One of several such
establishments I own.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.628
You're a funny man.

24:21.753 --> 24:24.131
Huh? A very funny man.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.634
Ned!

24:34.391 --> 24:36.143
Ah, the Starks...

24:36.226 --> 24:39.104
Quick tempers, slow minds.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.820
You broke my nose, bastard!

24:54.995 --> 24:56.205
It's an improvement.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.336
If we threw you over the Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.671
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

25:09.468 --> 25:11.470
What are you looking at, halfman?

25:11.595 --> 25:14.139
I'm looking at you.

25:15.224 --> 25:19.394
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

25:20.479 --> 25:23.565
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

25:23.649 --> 25:25.275
All of you.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.528
And what do you care about our faces?

25:27.611 --> 25:29.404
It's just...

25:29.530 --> 25:33.492
I think they would look marvellous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.537
Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.124
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

25:46.922 --> 25:51.385
Everybody knew what this place was
and no one told me.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.845
No one but you.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.516
My father knew and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.726
Grenn's father left him too...

25:59.852 --> 26:02.980
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

26:04.022 --> 26:07.067
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

26:07.192 --> 26:10.445
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days.

26:10.571 --> 26:14.241
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

26:14.366 --> 26:18.245
I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.247
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

26:20.372 --> 26:24.751
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

26:24.877 --> 26:27.337
I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

26:27.462 --> 26:29.464
before they came here.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.720
Oh...

26:34.803 --> 26:36.889
Your brother Bran.

26:37.890 --> 26:40.058
He's woken up.

26:41.393 --> 26:44.438
The mere suggestion that the queen's brother
tried to kill your boy

26:44.521 --> 26:45.772
would be considered treason.

26:45.856 --> 26:48.108
We have proof. We have the blade.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.235
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.821
The only man who could say otherwise
has no throat,

26:52.946 --> 26:54.198
thanks to your boy's wolf.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.076
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

26:59.244 --> 27:03.540
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.126
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake.

27:06.251 --> 27:07.961
A fool's task, admittedly,

27:08.086 --> 27:10.631
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.799
I won't forget this.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.968
You're a true friend.

27:15.052 --> 27:18.222
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.895
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.772
He's a child. Ten years old.

27:26.897 --> 27:29.233
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

27:29.316 --> 27:31.818
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

27:31.902 --> 27:35.739
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.908
Then what are you raving about?

27:37.991 --> 27:41.453
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

27:41.537 --> 27:43.830
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

27:43.914 --> 27:47.793
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

27:47.876 --> 27:51.004
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

27:51.129 --> 27:53.757
They can write a ballad about us -

27:53.841 --> 27:55.551
"The War For Cersei's Cunt."

28:01.139 --> 28:03.100
- Let me go.
- Never.

28:03.183 --> 28:06.979
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

28:07.896 --> 28:10.065
And if he does, I'll kill him.

28:10.190 --> 28:13.527
Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

28:13.610 --> 28:18.115
until you and I are the only people
left in this world.

28:29.168 --> 28:31.086
I wish I could see the girls.

28:31.170 --> 28:34.423
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

28:34.464 --> 28:36.675
Until we know who our enemies are.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.886
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.888
In my bones, I know it.

28:40.971 --> 28:42.890
Littlefinger's right.

28:44.641 --> 28:46.810
I can't do anything without proof.

28:46.935 --> 28:49.479
And if you find the proof?

28:49.563 --> 28:51.607
Then I bring it to Robert...

28:51.690 --> 28:54.401
and hope he's still the man I once knew.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.322
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

28:59.323 --> 29:01.742
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.368
My temper?

29:03.493 --> 29:07.372
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.004
He still loves you.

29:15.172 --> 29:16.924
Does he?

29:34.399 --> 29:36.151
Off with you.

30:08.350 --> 30:11.520
Yes, it's been a long time.

30:12.563 --> 30:15.148
But I still remember every face.

30:16.859 --> 30:18.861
You remember your first?

30:21.321 --> 30:23.407
Of course, Your Grace.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.492
Who was it?

30:25.576 --> 30:27.202
A Tyroshi.

30:27.828 --> 30:30.038
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.374
How did you do it?

30:32.499 --> 30:34.418
Lance through the heart.

30:34.543 --> 30:36.253
Quick one.

30:37.754 --> 30:40.007
Lucky for you.

30:40.090 --> 30:43.886
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

30:45.554 --> 30:49.975
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,
slogging through the mud.

30:51.310 --> 30:56.565
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

30:56.690 --> 31:01.361
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.740
I knocked him down with the hammer.

31:04.865 --> 31:07.201
Gods, I was strong then.

31:07.284 --> 31:10.037
Caved in his breastplate.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.457
Probably shattered every rib he had.

31:14.166 --> 31:17.169
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

31:17.961 --> 31:23.342
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait! Wait."

31:29.014 --> 31:32.643
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

31:34.269 --> 31:37.064
They don't put that part in the songs.

31:39.691 --> 31:41.068
Stupid boy.

31:43.403 --> 31:48.367
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

31:48.450 --> 31:53.121
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

31:53.163 --> 31:56.792
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

31:56.959 --> 31:59.795
his sons would be ingrates,

31:59.920 --> 32:04.383
and he'd be waking three times in the night
to piss into a bowl.

32:04.508 --> 32:06.260
Wine!

32:08.971 --> 32:13.392
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

32:14.518 --> 32:17.062
Lancel Lannister.

32:18.188 --> 32:22.276
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

32:25.404 --> 32:27.406
What are you doing?

32:28.824 --> 32:31.451
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

32:31.577 --> 32:34.371
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?!

32:36.373 --> 32:38.667
So get more.

32:42.546 --> 32:44.923
Tell your cousin to get in here.

32:45.048 --> 32:48.135
Kingslayer! Get in here.

32:55.726 --> 32:58.812
Surrounded by Lannisters.

32:58.937 --> 33:02.649
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

33:02.733 --> 33:06.153
and their smug, satisfied faces.

33:07.112 --> 33:09.198
It must wound your pride, huh?

33:09.281 --> 33:12.159
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.

33:13.660 --> 33:17.456
Jaime Lannister
son of the mighty Tywin...

33:18.790 --> 33:24.171
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

33:26.173 --> 33:27.674
So come on.

33:27.758 --> 33:29.760
We're telling war stories.

33:31.011 --> 33:34.640
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

33:35.974 --> 33:38.519
One of the outlaws
in the brotherhood.

33:38.644 --> 33:41.146
I was there that day.

33:41.271 --> 33:44.358
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

33:44.441 --> 33:47.319
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

33:47.444 --> 33:49.530
Best move I ever saw.

33:49.613 --> 33:53.909
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.161
Your outlaw...

33:57.204 --> 33:58.705
any last words?

33:58.789 --> 34:01.542
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.545
What about Aerys Targaryen?

34:04.670 --> 34:08.465
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

34:08.549 --> 34:10.676
I never asked.

34:11.301 --> 34:13.637
Did he call you a traitor?

34:13.762 --> 34:16.764
Did he plead for a reprieve?

34:18.350 --> 34:21.311
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

34:22.980 --> 34:25.148
"Burn them all."

34:30.027 --> 34:31.864
if that's all, Your Grace...

35:04.229 --> 35:06.648
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

35:06.732 --> 35:08.775
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

35:08.859 --> 35:11.111
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

35:11.195 --> 35:12.654
From whom?

35:12.779 --> 35:16.325
If you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

35:16.450 --> 35:18.243
pay tribute or fight.

35:18.327 --> 35:20.078
An easy choice for most.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.582
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

35:23.707 --> 35:27.085
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

35:27.336 --> 35:29.630
He might think the men too weak
or the women too ugly.

35:29.713 --> 35:33.509
Sometimes a khal decides
his riders haven't had a good fight in months

35:33.634 --> 35:37.194
- and need the practice.
- [Kash qoy qoyi thira disse] Only while blood of my blood lives.

35:39.765 --> 35:41.642
Tell them all to stop.

35:41.725 --> 35:44.853
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

35:46.396 --> 35:48.774
Until I command them otherwise.

35:49.358 --> 35:51.652
You're learning to talk like a queen.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.695
Not a queen.

35:53.779 --> 35:55.656
A khaleesi.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.418
[Annakhas dozgosores]
Stop the horde.

36:32.651 --> 36:34.695
You dare!

36:34.820 --> 36:38.073
You give commands to me? To me?

36:40.033 --> 36:43.704
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

36:43.787 --> 36:48.542
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

36:51.503 --> 36:54.037
[Hash shafka zali addrivat mae, zhey Khaleesi?]
Do you want him dead khaleesi?

36:54.047 --> 36:56.592
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

36:56.758 --> 36:58.218
No.

36:58.343 --> 37:01.753
[Ishish chare acharoe hash me nem ejervae nharesoon.]
Maybe the ear will listen if it is removed from the head.

37:01.763 --> 37:04.266
Rakharo say you should take ear,
to teach respect.

37:04.433 --> 37:07.019
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

37:11.148 --> 37:14.943
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

37:15.652 --> 37:17.728
[Khaleesi vos zalo meme nem azisa]
Khaleesi, does not want him harmed.

37:17.738 --> 37:20.073
Huh?

37:21.074 --> 37:23.827
[Chiftik]
Cricket.

37:27.664 --> 37:31.210
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

37:36.507 --> 37:39.218
I am your king!

37:40.427 --> 37:43.347
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

38:03.800 --> 38:06.100
Uh uh uh uh uh.

38:06.453 --> 38:08.705
You... walk.

40:38.981 --> 40:43.360
I wanted to be here
when you saw it for the first time.

40:51.577 --> 40:54.830
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

40:55.914 --> 40:58.083
I'm the First Ranger.

40:58.166 --> 41:00.586
My job is out there.

41:00.711 --> 41:03.839
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

41:03.922 --> 41:05.799
The kind I don't want to believe.

41:07.509 --> 41:09.928
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

41:10.888 --> 41:12.431
You're not going.

41:14.933 --> 41:16.727
You're no ranger, Jon.

41:16.852 --> 41:19.479
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

41:24.735 --> 41:26.486
Here...

41:26.653 --> 41:28.864
a man gets what he earns,

41:28.947 --> 41:31.033
when he earns it.

41:35.078 --> 41:37.164
We'll speak when I return.

41:52.888 --> 41:55.891
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

41:56.016 --> 41:59.353
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,

41:59.561 --> 42:02.064
all fried in his own fat.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.733
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

42:04.858 --> 42:08.320
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

42:09.029 --> 42:11.532
And how do a bear's balls taste?

42:11.657 --> 42:13.867
A bit chewy.

42:16.036 --> 42:20.165
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

42:20.249 --> 42:21.917
Do Dornish girls count?

42:25.921 --> 42:31.176
So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

42:31.343 --> 42:33.345
and bring them here as eager recruits?

42:33.470 --> 42:35.180
Aye.

42:35.222 --> 42:38.225
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things.

42:38.308 --> 42:41.228
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

42:41.353 --> 42:44.189
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

42:44.314 --> 42:46.441
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

42:49.111 --> 42:51.238
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it?

42:52.364 --> 42:56.577
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?

42:56.702 --> 42:58.787
You don't have enough men
to be an army

42:58.912 --> 43:02.457
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

43:02.666 --> 43:05.294
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

43:05.377 --> 43:07.129
when you're back in King's Landing.

43:07.296 --> 43:10.883
It's something to think about
while you're drinking your wine down there,

43:11.008 --> 43:13.010
enjoying your brothels.

43:14.094 --> 43:17.389
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

43:18.265 --> 43:20.684
Might be a wildling's axe that gets them,

43:20.851 --> 43:23.437
might be sickness,

43:23.562 --> 43:26.273
might just be the cold.

43:26.356 --> 43:28.150
They die in pain.

43:29.359 --> 43:30.819
And they do it...

43:30.944 --> 43:36.074
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

43:38.869 --> 43:40.662
Do you think I'm plump?

43:43.957 --> 43:47.586
- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

43:47.669 --> 43:50.005
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

43:50.130 --> 43:52.174
I have great admiration for the Night's Watch.

43:52.299 --> 43:54.718
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

43:54.885 --> 43:56.845
You know, my brother once told me...

43:56.970 --> 44:01.475
that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.

44:01.558 --> 44:03.227
But...

44:04.144 --> 44:07.272
I don't believe that giants and ghouls
and white walkers

44:07.397 --> 44:09.149
are lurking beyond the Wall.

44:10.067 --> 44:13.320
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

44:13.487 --> 44:16.198
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

44:16.281 --> 44:18.408
to live on the right side of it.

44:18.492 --> 44:20.327
You're right.

44:22.037 --> 44:24.164
The wildlings are no different from us.

44:25.123 --> 44:27.042
A little rougher maybe.

44:27.167 --> 44:29.795
But they're made of meat and bone.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.506
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

44:33.173 --> 44:36.301
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

44:37.594 --> 44:42.015
You've never been north of the Wall
so don't tell me what's out there.

44:45.602 --> 44:47.604
Are you going below?

44:49.189 --> 44:52.442
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

44:52.609 --> 44:54.319
Oh, I always do.

45:03.537 --> 45:05.706
I think he's starting to like me.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.837
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

45:12.004 --> 45:15.757
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

45:15.799 --> 45:18.468
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

45:20.721 --> 45:23.724
So... you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

45:23.849 --> 45:26.435
Aye, day after tomorrow.

45:26.560 --> 45:30.272
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

45:30.355 --> 45:34.526
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

45:34.610 --> 45:36.778
I, er...

45:36.862 --> 45:39.615
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

45:39.698 --> 45:43.619
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

45:43.744 --> 45:46.121
No one turns away a Lannister.

45:58.425 --> 45:59.925
[Athjahakar]
Pride, prowess

46:00.385 --> 46:02.185
[Athjahakar]
Pride, prowess

46:02.262 --> 46:03.931
Yes, Khaleesi.

46:05.766 --> 46:07.935
Oh, what are you doing?

46:08.018 --> 46:10.604
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

46:13.065 --> 46:15.025
You change, Khaleesi.

46:16.485 --> 46:19.085
[Me azhasavva vezhofoon.]
it's a blessing from the Great Stallion.

46:24.243 --> 46:28.288
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,

46:28.372 --> 46:30.082
easier to handle.

46:30.249 --> 46:33.085
It's a good weapon for a 'Dothrakaan'.
[Dothrakaan = Rider]

46:34.294 --> 46:38.423
But a man in full plate... shori tawakof
[shori tawakof = steel dress]

46:38.549 --> 46:40.634
...the arakh won't get through the steel.

46:41.760 --> 46:43.971
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

46:44.012 --> 46:46.974
Designed for piercing plate.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.450
[Dothraki vos ondeo shoris tawakofi]
Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.439
- Armour.
- Armour.

46:54.565 --> 46:57.150
Armour make a man, erm...

46:57.317 --> 46:59.278
- Vroz?
- Slow.

46:59.403 --> 47:02.990
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

47:04.449 --> 47:07.169
[Ave anni ezzo anhaan os lajataan.]
My father taught me how to fight.

47:07.244 --> 47:10.664
[Me ezzo anhaan m'athdikar assie athzhokwazar.]
He taught me that speed defeats size.

47:10.789 --> 47:13.542
I've heard that
your father was a famous warrior.

47:13.625 --> 47:16.003
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.

47:18.672 --> 47:22.541
[Majin ave yeri Jorah Andahli? Hash me lajakoon akka?]
And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?

47:22.551 --> 47:25.012
He still is.

47:25.095 --> 47:27.514
A man of great honour

47:27.639 --> 47:29.474
and I betrayed him.

47:34.479 --> 47:36.805
[Khaleesi zala meme adakha esinakh ajjalan. Ogi loy mawizzi.]
The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight.

47:36.815 --> 47:38.817
Kill some rabbits.

47:38.942 --> 47:40.986
[Vo mawizzi vekho jinne]
There are no rabbits.

47:41.111 --> 47:44.871
[Ezas loy alegri h'anhaan. Mori allayafi mae, jin alegra.]
Find some ducks me, she likes ducks.

47:44.907 --> 47:48.483
[Hash yer ray tih loy alegra zhey vikeesi? Vo mawizzi, vo alegri.]
Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks.

47:48.493 --> 47:50.986
[Hash tihi vekhi she nhare yeroon? Hash tih?]
Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?

47:50.996 --> 47:53.155
[Majin jano. Anha ray tih san jani.]
Dog then. I have seen many dogs.

47:53.165 --> 47:55.542
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

47:58.921 --> 48:01.590
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

48:03.217 --> 48:06.470
It is true. She does not bleed
for two moons.

48:06.595 --> 48:08.931
Her belly start to swell.

48:10.724 --> 48:13.101
[Azhasavva vezhofoon]
A blessing from the Great Stallion.

48:13.185 --> 48:15.229
She does not want to eat horse.

48:16.271 --> 48:19.066
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

48:24.363 --> 48:26.907
I need to ride to Qohor.

48:29.952 --> 48:33.872
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

48:33.956 --> 48:36.208
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

48:36.333 --> 48:38.710
The horde's easy to find.

48:50.055 --> 48:54.601
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

48:58.856 --> 49:01.692
Except for you. You move too much.

49:01.817 --> 49:04.361
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

49:09.825 --> 49:12.953
How many winters
have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

49:13.036 --> 49:15.289
Eight. No, nine.

49:15.747 --> 49:17.833
All of them brief?

49:17.958 --> 49:21.003
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

49:21.128 --> 49:24.173
This summer has lasted nine.

49:24.298 --> 49:28.510
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

49:28.594 --> 49:30.971
The Starks are always right eventually -

49:31.096 --> 49:33.515
winter is coming.

49:34.433 --> 49:36.476
This one will be long...

49:37.394 --> 49:39.521
and dark things will come with it.

49:39.563 --> 49:44.234
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

49:44.318 --> 49:45.652
They're fleeing south.

49:45.777 --> 49:49.907
The ones who flee...
say they've seen the white walkers.

49:49.990 --> 49:53.285
Yes, and the fishermen
of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

49:53.410 --> 49:56.872
One of our own rangers swore he saw them
kill his companions.

49:56.955 --> 50:01.001
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

50:01.084 --> 50:05.547
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

50:05.631 --> 50:08.050
and what lies beyond.

50:08.175 --> 50:13.722
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

50:13.889 --> 50:16.475
There are less than a thousand of us now.

50:17.559 --> 50:20.312
We can't man the other castles on the Wall.

50:20.479 --> 50:23.398
We can't properly patrol the wilderness.

50:23.524 --> 50:27.903
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

50:28.028 --> 50:31.949
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

50:33.617 --> 50:36.286
Tell her... we need help.

50:36.370 --> 50:41.208
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

51:03.897 --> 51:05.566
[Me rakh]
It's a boy.

51:10.070 --> 51:12.322
[Kifinosi yer nesi?]
How do you know?

51:14.700 --> 51:16.702
[Anha sekke nesa.]
I very knows.

51:48.108 --> 51:50.402
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

51:52.279 --> 51:54.239
It's either me or this cold,

51:54.364 --> 51:56.617
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

51:56.700 --> 51:59.494
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

51:59.620 --> 52:00.829
I expect I will.

52:00.913 --> 52:05.083
Gods know there aren't many feather beds
between here and King's Landing.

52:05.167 --> 52:07.211
If you see my brother Bran,

52:07.294 --> 52:09.963
tell him I miss him.

52:10.756 --> 52:12.216
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

52:12.299 --> 52:13.592
Of course.

52:14.676 --> 52:16.136
He'll never walk again.

52:16.261 --> 52:20.057
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

52:20.140 --> 52:22.559
You take care, Snow.

52:22.684 --> 52:24.520
Farewell, my lord.

52:36.406 --> 52:38.825
[Foreign accent] You are late, boy.

52:40.911 --> 52:43.205
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

52:43.330 --> 52:45.582
Who are you?

52:46.291 --> 52:49.503
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

52:53.799 --> 52:55.259
Tomorrow you will catch it.

52:55.384 --> 52:57.177
Now pick it up.

52:59.638 --> 53:01.932
That is not the way, boy.

53:02.015 --> 53:06.144
It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

53:06.311 --> 53:10.232
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

53:10.315 --> 53:12.109
to make you strong.

53:13.151 --> 53:14.611
Just so.

53:14.736 --> 53:17.030
One hand is all that is needed.

53:18.407 --> 53:20.407
Now you are standing all wrong.

53:20.534 --> 53:22.870
Turn your body sideface.

53:22.995 --> 53:25.247
Yes.

53:25.330 --> 53:27.583
So.

53:27.708 --> 53:30.002
You are skinny. That is good.

53:30.794 --> 53:32.921
The target is smaller.

53:33.046 --> 53:35.132
Now the grip - let me see.

53:36.258 --> 53:37.885
Yes.

53:37.968 --> 53:40.637
The grip must be delicate.

53:41.722 --> 53:43.557
What if I drop it?

53:43.640 --> 53:46.018
The steel must be part of your arm.

53:46.143 --> 53:48.770
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

53:48.854 --> 53:52.941
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

53:53.025 --> 53:55.777
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

53:55.903 --> 53:57.613
I'm a girl.

53:57.696 --> 54:03.118
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

54:04.786 --> 54:06.580
That is the grip.

54:06.663 --> 54:09.666
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

54:09.750 --> 54:11.126
A needle.

54:11.210 --> 54:13.879
Ahhh.

54:14.755 --> 54:16.465
Just so.

54:16.507 --> 54:19.301
Now we will begin the dance.

54:19.468 --> 54:20.844
Remember, child,

54:20.969 --> 54:23.805
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning...

54:23.889 --> 54:27.726
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

54:28.519 --> 54:31.563
This is the Braavos dance...

54:33.065 --> 54:34.983
the water dance.

54:35.108 --> 54:37.277
It is swift...

54:37.361 --> 54:39.613
and sudden.

54:41.073 --> 54:43.283
All men are made of water.

54:43.408 --> 54:45.118
Do you know this?

54:45.202 --> 54:47.538
If you pierce them,

54:47.621 --> 54:51.250
the water leaks out and they die.

54:52.543 --> 54:55.754
Now you will try to strike me.

54:58.882 --> 55:00.676
Ha!

55:12.437 --> 55:13.814
Up!

55:17.317 --> 55:18.318
Ha!

55:29.705 --> 55:30.914
Ah.

55:33.458 --> 55:35.002
Dead.

55:35.085 --> 55:36.086
Oh!

55:36.170 --> 55:37.838
Dead.

55:37.921 --> 55:39.798
Hup!

55:42.384 --> 55:44.386
Very dead.

55:44.469 --> 55:46.305
Come.

55:47.014 --> 55:49.057
Ah ah ah!

55:49.183 --> 55:51.935
Hup!

55:52.644 --> 55:54.521
Again, faster.

55:58.984 --> 56:00.903
Ah.

56:05.069 --> 56:10.906
