00:33.523 --> 00:38.123
1964 brought
new energy to medicine.

00:39.123 --> 00:42.722
An ever stronger sense
that people could be helped.

00:42.723 --> 00:44.923
Things could be done.

00:49.323 --> 00:51.402
Careful!

00:51.403 --> 00:52.802
Sorry, Nurse.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.802
There was change in the air,

00:54.803 --> 00:57.402
but also a feeling that the old ways

00:57.403 --> 00:59.682
still held sway.

00:59.683 --> 01:02.402
A hanging on.

01:02.403 --> 01:04.483
A never letting go.

01:09.363 --> 01:11.322
Thank you, Mrs Adler. Thank you.

01:11.323 --> 01:12.922
I'll see you next week.

01:12.923 --> 01:15.082
Keep up the good work.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.042
That's the last of the ulcer patients.

01:17.043 --> 01:19.322
No sign again of your Miss Millgrove.

01:19.323 --> 01:21.562
It's the second treatment
session that she's missed.

01:21.563 --> 01:23.242
Oh, that's worrying.

01:23.243 --> 01:25.282
I'll add her to this
evening's house calls.

01:25.283 --> 01:27.282
There's no need to go looking for work.

01:27.283 --> 01:30.002
You're already very
over-committed, Doctor.

01:30.003 --> 01:32.322
Nurse Anderson, please
add Miss Millgrove

01:32.323 --> 01:34.562
to your district rounds this afternoon.

01:34.563 --> 01:36.802
- That's you told.
- Of course.

01:36.803 --> 01:38.162
I'll put her on my list.

01:38.163 --> 01:40.002
Thank you, Nurse Anderson.

01:40.003 --> 01:42.163
- Clinic!
- Thank you, Miss Higgins.

01:45.323 --> 01:48.322
Ch-e-ese.

01:48.323 --> 01:51.322
Thank you! It's a very big day for us.

01:51.323 --> 01:53.122
Nobody's interested in our business!

01:53.123 --> 01:55.722
Hey, it's not every day the Aidoo family

01:55.723 --> 01:59.175
applies for British
citizenship! Come on, let's go!

01:59.200 --> 02:00.483
Let's go, let's go.

02:06.003 --> 02:07.163
Mind out!

02:08.643 --> 02:11.042
You're wasting your time there, love.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.802
No-one's seen her for weeks.

02:12.803 --> 02:16.042
She won't even come to the door
for the man from the council.

02:16.043 --> 02:17.882
Pest man.

02:17.883 --> 02:21.082
I've got mice in my floorboards
and mould in my walls

02:21.083 --> 02:22.482
because of her filth.

02:22.483 --> 02:24.563
And they say it's the
foreigners who are dirty.

02:25.803 --> 02:27.483
No offence.

02:35.723 --> 02:39.163
Miss Millgrove? Nurse calling!

02:41.003 --> 02:42.842
Excuse me? What's your name?

02:42.843 --> 02:44.562
Maureen Parkin.

02:44.563 --> 02:46.722
Well, Maureen, can you
run for a policeman?

02:46.723 --> 02:49.242
I think something has happened
to the lady who lives here.

02:49.243 --> 02:52.122
She was fine when I was in earlier.

02:52.123 --> 02:53.683
I fetch her groceries.

02:54.603 --> 02:58.162
That's very neighbourly.
Not really. She pays me.

02:58.163 --> 02:59.962
Oh, don't tell me mother.

02:59.963 --> 03:02.043
She wouldn't like me taking money.

03:04.683 --> 03:06.402
Listen, Maureen,

03:06.403 --> 03:09.082
I won't tell your mother if you
tell me how you get that shopping

03:09.083 --> 03:10.843
into Miss Millgrove's house.

03:36.603 --> 03:38.642
Nurse calling.

03:38.643 --> 03:41.082
May I come in?

03:41.083 --> 03:43.483
I've been sent by Dr Turner.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.483
Miss Millgrove?

04:13.483 --> 04:16.642
Miss Millgrove? Is that you, girl?

04:18.762 --> 04:20.802
My name is Nurse Anderson.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.282
Please don't be alarmed.

04:22.283 --> 04:24.162
I was concerned for your wellbeing,

04:24.163 --> 04:26.882
so I persuaded young
Maureen to let me in.

04:26.883 --> 04:30.482
Be gone! I shall send for the police!

04:30.483 --> 04:33.722
I'm sorry, Miss Millgrove, but
you require medical attention.

04:33.723 --> 04:36.682
And if you will not
allow me to treat you,

04:36.683 --> 04:39.082
I will be obliged to send
for Dr Turner. You will not!

04:39.083 --> 04:40.683
I will so!

04:59.763 --> 05:01.682
This queue's moving rather slowly.

05:01.683 --> 05:04.882
I'd help you out, but Nurse
Anderson covering the district roster

05:04.883 --> 05:07.202
- has left us terribly short-handed.
- Thank you.

05:07.203 --> 05:08.923
But, really, I can manage.

05:10.003 --> 05:12.522
- Someone's feeling the cold.
- It's Master Aidoo.

05:12.523 --> 05:15.242
He's off school with aches
and pains, apparently.

05:15.243 --> 05:17.842
The last thing we need
is a dose of influenza.

05:17.843 --> 05:20.642
I'll make a precautionary
foray with the thermometer.

05:20.643 --> 05:23.922
No need. I've already
taken his temperature. Oh.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.442
No fever present.

05:25.443 --> 05:27.482
And there's nothing
wrong with his appetite.

05:27.483 --> 05:29.962
I tested it with two
digestives and a pink wafer.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.282
Excellent use of initiative.

05:32.283 --> 05:35.762
But you might want to
desist with the biscuit tin.

05:35.763 --> 05:38.083
He'll be putting you
down as a soft touch.

05:41.403 --> 05:42.962
And a sharp scratch.

05:42.963 --> 05:44.602
I'll be as quick as I can.

05:44.603 --> 05:47.402
Take all the time you need, as
long as I don't need to watch.

05:47.403 --> 05:49.242
Oh, I know. Blood. Yuck!

05:49.243 --> 05:50.562
I don't mind anyone else's

05:50.563 --> 05:52.802
but as soon as I catch
a glimpse of my own...

05:52.803 --> 05:55.562
Were you anaemic in your
last pregnancy, Mrs Aidoo?

05:55.563 --> 05:58.482
Yes. Just like this. The same tiredness.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.002
There's nothing in your notes.

06:00.003 --> 06:02.202
Ah, we were living back
home when my son was born.

06:02.203 --> 06:04.562
- In Accra. - Ah, the Gold Coast?
- Yes.

06:04.563 --> 06:07.522
- But we're called Ghana now.
- Of course. Independence.

06:07.523 --> 06:11.282
- And you're taking the tablets I prescribed?
- Twice a day.

06:11.283 --> 06:15.402
- And my husband feeds me brown beer and liver.
- Good man.

06:15.403 --> 06:17.283
Ah, finger on that for me.

06:23.843 --> 06:27.162
I'm sorry. This treatment
is always rather painful.

06:27.163 --> 06:29.283
Worse when it's being botched.

06:31.363 --> 06:34.442
Do you have a nursing
background, Miss Millgrove?

06:34.467 --> 06:36.667
The school room was my vocation.

06:37.803 --> 06:39.162
But, as a young woman,

06:39.760 --> 06:44.322
I served as a voluntary ambulance
driver on the Eastern Front.

06:44.323 --> 06:47.282
Only I'd expect someone with
medical knowledge to know

06:47.283 --> 06:50.082
the importance of keeping
doctors' appointments.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.162
And of maintaining a hygienic home.

06:52.163 --> 06:54.562
My home is my business.

06:54.563 --> 06:56.282
I'm afraid that's not so.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.642
I have a duty to inform
the Welfare Officer

06:58.643 --> 07:01.920
- if I think you're not managing.
- I am managing!

07:01.920 --> 07:05.255
I see you've made efforts
to dress your ulcers.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.639
But your environment is unsanitary.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.999
And I can't imagine how you
find your way out to the bathroom

07:11.000 --> 07:13.237
- when nature calls.
- Young woman!

07:13.360 --> 07:16.439
You have a most impertinent manner.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.880
With respect, Miss Millgrove, so do you.

07:23.438 --> 07:28.400
I'll admit, I find the trek
to the lavatory rather a chore.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.559
I can help with that. For every
problem, there is a solution.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.980
That's the first sensible
thing you've said all day.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.819
It came in the first
post! I've been selected!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.600
Oh, that's nice. Good for you.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.239
Are we celebrating?

07:50.240 --> 07:53.119
I've been chosen to run
for election to the new

07:53.120 --> 07:55.039
Tower Hamlets Borough Council.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.919
Congratulations, Mrs Buckle!

07:56.920 --> 07:59.799
The man they chose first took
a turn and had to pull out.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.239
So, here I am! Vote Violet Buckle!

08:03.240 --> 08:06.079
Oh, I shall reserve my
decision until I've had

08:06.080 --> 08:08.519
a thorough perusal of your manifesto.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.840
I don't put my cross in
the box for any old rubbish.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.000
Well, you were the one who
wanted to go into politics...

08:26.900 --> 08:29.699
And, then, after my round,
Mr Thompson took me aside.

08:29.872 --> 08:32.211
He told me I have
potential for advancement.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.928
So, I asked him if I can be considered
for the supervisor's training.

08:34.952 --> 08:38.090
- Did he say yes?
- No. But he didn't say no.

08:38.115 --> 08:40.280
Hey, some of the men
from the sorting office

08:40.280 --> 08:43.419
- have asked me if I'll try out for their football team.
- Football? You?

08:43.443 --> 08:45.208
I know. But it makes me one of the lads.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.615
Here, I'll get that.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.320
- You sit down, you should be resting.
- Hey, yeah.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.110
Midwife calling!

08:55.135 --> 08:57.535
Oh, Sister. Please, do come in.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.960
No need for any fuss.
It's a flying visit.

09:00.541 --> 09:05.335
Mrs Aidoo, I'm afraid your
iron levels are still lower

09:05.360 --> 09:06.760
than Doctor would like.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.639
He's arranged for further
investigations at St Cuthbert's.

09:10.094 --> 09:12.429
And the baby will need to be
delivered in the maternity home

09:12.453 --> 09:13.600
rather than here in your flat.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.147
But the tablets were supposed
to make my wife better.

09:16.172 --> 09:19.195
Yes I know. You have been
taking them, Mrs Aidoo?

09:19.268 --> 09:22.291
Only some women don't understand
the seriousness of anaemia...

09:22.316 --> 09:23.933
We understand perfectly.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.277
We are educated people.

09:25.302 --> 09:27.181
Please, forgive my husband.

09:27.206 --> 09:29.245
He has a post-graduate qualification.

09:29.270 --> 09:31.309
He's very proud of his achievements.

09:31.662 --> 09:33.660
And so he should be.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.210
You must be frightfully
clever, Mr Aidoo.

09:37.235 --> 09:40.020
Now, I shall respectfully withdraw.

09:41.516 --> 09:43.075
Not at school, young man?

09:43.100 --> 09:44.979
He suffers from growing pains.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.110
He'll be back in the classroom tomorrow.

09:48.022 --> 09:50.743
If he isn't, do take him
to be checked by Dr Turner.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.123
Of course.

09:54.443 --> 09:56.735
Ah. Good evening, Sister.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.057
I wonder if you've had any thoughts
about the upcoming election?

10:00.082 --> 10:06.761
Oh, yes, Mrs Buckle, you
are as Queen Zenobia...

10:06.989 --> 10:08.949
about to conquer!

10:12.791 --> 10:14.430
Improving and developing

10:14.455 --> 10:17.940
leisure facilities is at
the heart of my manifesto.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.414
We're all going to have
a lot more leisure time

10:20.439 --> 10:23.278
when workers start being
replaced by machines.

10:23.530 --> 10:25.960
I'd like to see a robot
trying to do any of our jobs.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.660
Obviously, that bit
wouldn't apply to you.

10:29.845 --> 10:33.455
Did I mention, erm, dustbin collections?

10:33.480 --> 10:38.111
- At length.
- And libraries, road repairs, adult education,

10:38.252 --> 10:40.000
the state of the kiddies' play parks

10:40.000 --> 10:43.580
and the paucity of safe crossing
places on our minor roads.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.819
I know it seems like small potatoes,

10:50.038 --> 10:52.916
but it's the little things
that make a community.

10:53.144 --> 10:57.520
It used to be that folk that lived
round here had family to rely on,

10:57.520 --> 10:59.039
but Poplar's changing.

10:59.064 --> 11:02.233
Old families are moving out,
fresh ones are moving in.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.640
I want to make Poplar a place

11:05.640 --> 11:10.839
that feels like home to all her residents,
old and new.

11:10.864 --> 11:16.064
That's how we build a community
that can thrive, and expand,

11:16.089 --> 11:19.808
and be rich in opportunity for all.

11:19.833 --> 11:24.512
All those in favour of the
election of Mrs Buckle, say "aye".

11:24.732 --> 11:26.332
Aye.

11:27.430 --> 11:28.470
Aye.

11:33.467 --> 11:38.666
"Jane likes the dog and
Peter likes the dog."

11:42.067 --> 11:44.146
Don't worry. Mamma's fine.

11:44.536 --> 11:46.135
But can you be a big boy for me?

11:46.160 --> 11:47.519
You know where Daddy is?

11:47.520 --> 11:49.880
Can you run and fetch
him as fast as you can?

11:58.626 --> 12:01.220
Come on, mate, you can
do better than that.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.140
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah, sorry.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.780
I just need a minute. You carry on.

12:33.020 --> 12:37.180
Son? Son, what's, what's the
matter? Where's your mother?

12:40.700 --> 12:43.299
I'm hoping I can clear her some space.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.700
Maybe get rid of some
of the old tins of food.

12:46.940 --> 12:50.015
Or start organising her
huge collection of books.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.640
That's very thoughtful of you. But
I'm sure you can find other ways

12:53.640 --> 12:56.068
- to spend your evening off.
- I don't mind.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.720
I know everyone thinks Miss
Millgrove is a terrible tyrant,

12:59.720 --> 13:01.280
but I'm quite fond of her.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.399
Sorry to interrupt, that
was Mr Aidoo on the phone.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.559
- His wife's gone into labour.
- That's my anaemic lady.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.120
But I gave her strict instructions
to go to the maternity home

13:09.120 --> 13:11.880
- at the first sign of labour.
- I fear it's a little too late for that.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.895
Ah, well, if she's to deliver
at home, then Dr Turner

13:14.920 --> 13:18.519
- will need to attend. - I'll inform him.
- Thank you.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.900
Now, all I need is a second
in command. Nurse Franklin?

13:23.280 --> 13:24.599
Yes, Ma'am.

13:25.060 --> 13:27.400
- Nurse Anderson?
- Sister?

13:27.400 --> 13:31.159
Nurse Anderson, I
understand there is a library

13:31.160 --> 13:33.199
in need of organisation.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.879
Without my assistance,
I fear it may fall prey

13:36.880 --> 13:42.140
to the unimaginative strictures
of your Dewey Decimal System.

13:49.320 --> 13:53.402
I've built a rapport with this
family, so I'll take the tiller.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.440
Very well.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.759
I'll just stand and manicure my nails.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.560
Oh, don't worry, I'll have
plenty of little jobs for you.

14:04.814 --> 14:07.759
Thank you, Mr Aidoo. You
may make yourself scarce.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.980
Hot water and towels, please, Nurse.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.040
Hot water and towels, please, sweetie.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.840
- Help is at hand.
- I feel it.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.400
Let's pop you on the bed.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.359
You have no right to open
my house to all and sundry.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.760
If we do not make an
impression on this chaos,

14:28.760 --> 14:32.039
Welfare Services will be obliged
to find you a place in a home.

14:32.340 --> 14:33.480
I have a home!

14:33.480 --> 14:37.479
She speaks of an old person's home.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.540
Thank you, Sister.

14:43.437 --> 14:47.380
Now, you were to make a list of
items that can be disposed of.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.140
Thank you.

14:52.216 --> 14:54.520
There is only one item on this list.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.399
You may remove all tins of rhubarb.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.959
Canned cannot compete with fresh.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.279
Newly cut and dipped in sugar!

15:03.280 --> 15:05.079
With a sprinkle of salt.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.159
A Scottish habit, perhaps.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.280
Like too much Robert Louis Stevenson.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.519
No such thing.

15:11.520 --> 15:17.119
Oh! This is more like it!
My old friend, the Greeks!

15:17.120 --> 15:21.095
Miss Millgrove, we are
simpatico after all.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.015
I have a first edition

15:23.040 --> 15:27.440
of Pope's most excellent
translation of the Iliad.

15:27.440 --> 15:31.720
I shall bring it to you on
the occasion of my next visit.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.660
Oh, yes, please!

15:37.760 --> 15:40.280
That's it, nice and gentle, darling.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.440
Breathe out, slow and steady.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.279
Oh, well done! We have a baby!

15:57.160 --> 16:01.040
Mrs Aidoo, it is my
privilege to inform you

16:01.040 --> 16:03.440
that you have a daughter.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.879
A girl? Really?
Are you sure?

16:06.880 --> 16:07.960
Absolutely.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.360
I did check.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.199
She's perfect!

16:32.200 --> 16:33.959
Yes, she is.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.440
Well done.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.720
Oh! Speedy placenta!

16:46.220 --> 16:49.459
Are you all right there,
Flora? You look a little clammy.

16:49.460 --> 16:52.760
- I do feel odd.
- Let's pop the baby in her cot.

16:57.077 --> 16:59.596
Sister Hilda, is the placenta complete?

16:59.597 --> 17:01.340
Yes, it appears to be.

17:02.597 --> 17:06.935
So, tell me, dear, does the Ghanaian
culture have any special customs

17:06.960 --> 17:08.279
regarding the afterbirth?

17:08.280 --> 17:11.119
I don't want to whisk it off to the
incinerator if you have other plans.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.679
- I hadn't thought about it...
- Sister Hilda.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.118
You may scoff, Nurse,

17:15.119 --> 17:18.159
but sometimes our colonial brothers
and sisters do things differently.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.960
Flora's pulse is 120.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.279
And brisk blood loss. Oh, gosh.

17:23.280 --> 17:26.638
- I'm, I'm frightfully sorry, I... I got distracted!
- Flora.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.560
We need to get you lying flat.
Can you come down the bed, sweetie?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.519
Sister Hilda, I'm rubbing a contraction.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.680
- Can you administer the ergometrine, please?
- Yes. Yes. Of course.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.959
Slight scratch, darling.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.120
What's happening?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.679
You're losing a little bit of blood,

17:44.680 --> 17:47.455
but we'll have you as right
as rain in a moment or two.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.960
- You're in splendid hands.
- Absolutely. - Flora?

17:50.960 --> 17:53.560
Flora, keep your eyes open, sweetie!

18:01.520 --> 18:02.980
Her pulse is improving.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.639
- And so is the bleeding.
- Oh, thanks be to God.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.360
Good girl, Flora.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.560
You've been a trouper.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.759
We need to transfer her to either
the hospital or the maternity home.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.599
No, I want to stay at home.

18:14.600 --> 18:15.679
With my baby.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.880
Your baby can come, too, but
you've lost a lot of blood,

18:18.880 --> 18:21.999
you need a top up. Nurse Franklin
will telephone for an ambulance.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.919
And on your way, you can tell
Mr Aidoo that he has a daughter.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.420
Or you can leave all that to me.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.979
I'm perfectly happy to oblige,

18:31.980 --> 18:33.820
since you asked so nicely.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.219
Congratulations are in order, Mr Aidoo.

18:48.220 --> 18:52.700
You have the most beautiful baby girl.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.660
Do you hear that, Matthew?
You have a baby sister!

18:58.060 --> 19:00.660
My wife, is she well?

19:01.060 --> 19:04.979
Yes. She lost some blood,
so she's a little weak.

19:04.980 --> 19:08.260
We're waiting for the doctor.
He'll arrange the blood transfusion.

19:09.820 --> 19:14.219
- I imagine you'd like to give those to Mummy and your new baby?
- Yes.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.160
Are we ready for visitors, Sister Hilda?

19:19.160 --> 19:20.560
<i>I believe we are.</i>

19:54.880 --> 19:57.540
That poster should
have gone up yesterday.

19:59.760 --> 20:04.135
And remember, when transferring
a patient into the ambulance,

20:04.160 --> 20:05.640
bend your knees.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.880
It's going to be tough enough
operating in a nuclear environment

20:08.880 --> 20:11.455
without adding backache
to your problems.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.159
Apologies, gentlemen, but
you need to be packing up.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.735
Er, no! We've got ten minutes yet.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.240
Sorry, but I need to get
set up for the hustings.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.959
For the elections.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.800
Right, lads, that's us,
we got our marching orders.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.400
- The Black Sail?
- Yeah, I'll be right behind you.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.319
Oh, no, you're not, Fred Buckle.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.880
There'll be quite a crowd tonight,

20:31.880 --> 20:33.520
so you can help me set the chairs out.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.500
And then you can sit in one
of them and cheer me along.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.840
Sh...

20:46.960 --> 20:48.839
Sh...

20:53.400 --> 20:55.600
Enter.

20:57.160 --> 21:00.039
Ah. How is Mrs Aidoo?

21:00.040 --> 21:03.375
- The transfusion's going through nicely.
- Good.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.199
It was a heavy loss for
someone with anaemia.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.439
Doctor, may I mention something?

21:08.440 --> 21:11.815
After I stayed on in South
Africa, I saw two women...

21:11.840 --> 21:15.080
sisters, as it happened,
with similar symptoms to Flora Aidoo.

21:15.330 --> 21:17.502
Anaemia and large post-partum bleeds.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.006
Were they Xhosa ladies?

21:19.031 --> 21:22.763
No, they were migrants from
somewhere in West Africa.

21:23.387 --> 21:24.982
One of them was a widow.

21:25.275 --> 21:29.118
She told me that, where they were
from, there was a... a sickness

21:29.143 --> 21:31.823
that ran through some
families like a curse.

21:33.367 --> 21:36.566
Do you think it might be
appropriate to run some extra tests?

21:37.091 --> 21:39.620
It's always appropriate
when you need answers.

21:40.005 --> 21:43.805
And something about this
just doesn't feel quite right.

21:51.332 --> 21:54.651
Look at him! He's more
handsome than ever!

21:54.690 --> 21:57.520
Maybe if your Mr Poitier was
running for the Borough Council,

21:57.520 --> 21:59.011
you'd be more inclined to vote.

21:59.340 --> 22:02.779
- I haven't been here long enough to deserve a say.
- Nonsense.

22:02.804 --> 22:06.215
You've heard what Mrs Buckle says,
we're all part of the new Poplar.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.119
You know, it would be
quite the achievement

22:08.144 --> 22:10.983
- if she were to be elected.
- There are a couple of communists running

22:11.023 --> 22:13.302
in other wards. I wonder
what Mr Buckle makes of that.

22:13.355 --> 22:15.758
I imagine he doesn't know
or he'd be ranting about it

22:15.870 --> 22:17.589
being the thin edge of the wedge.

22:18.013 --> 22:20.878
One minute, it's a Communist
councillor talking about equality

22:20.903 --> 22:24.512
for all, and the next we're working
in the gulag, wearing furry hats

22:24.537 --> 22:25.640
that ruin our bouffants.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.720
Ooh! We'll have to lay in extra lacquer.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.039
Though I do think the Soviets
have got some things right.

22:32.064 --> 22:35.461
Gorgeous Mr Gagarin can take me
into orbit any day of the week.

22:38.193 --> 22:41.393
"My Girl" by The Temptations

22:43.197 --> 22:47.361
I am eager to represent
your interests today.

22:47.386 --> 22:49.026
I am Violet Buckle...

23:45.692 --> 23:48.332
Elizabeth for the Queen.

23:49.101 --> 23:51.994
And Akua because she
was born on a Wednesday.

23:52.019 --> 23:53.920
She's adorable.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.440
And what do you think of
the new addition, young man?

23:56.440 --> 23:58.655
She looks like a grumpy old man.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.374
Hey, that is your sister
you're talking about!

24:01.720 --> 24:04.400
Though when she cries, that's
exactly what she looks like.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.960
Oh, she won't be doing much crying.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.164
A proper, British girl
living in London town.

24:08.189 --> 24:10.068
What a life she'll have.

24:10.660 --> 24:12.920
Every day we thank
God for our blessings.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.279
Someone's looking after you. Your
iron levels are much improved.

24:16.304 --> 24:18.304
I feel like a whole new person.

24:19.282 --> 24:22.682
Well, the important thing is that
you have your vim and vigour back.

24:24.975 --> 24:26.415
Nurse calling!

24:27.655 --> 24:31.734
Oh no! It's all right, I'm here now.

24:32.870 --> 24:36.779
Ah, I was trying to use
that blasted contraption

24:36.780 --> 24:40.899
that caused me to tumble! Now get me up.

24:40.900 --> 24:45.014
I've lain here quite long enough
with my drawers round my knees.

24:45.039 --> 24:46.598
You're freezing!

24:46.623 --> 24:49.302
Tell me you've not been
lying here all night and day?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.160
Of course not!

24:55.988 --> 24:57.680
Could you say again, please?

24:57.680 --> 25:00.415
Er, yes, yes, of course, thank you.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.860
Goodbye.

25:02.104 --> 25:03.665
That was Nurse Anderson.

25:03.690 --> 25:05.727
Do you need me to put your tea on hold?

25:05.752 --> 25:08.893
Oh, no. But Clarice
Millgrove has had a fall.

25:08.918 --> 25:11.296
I think she's reached the
stage where she'll need help

25:11.321 --> 25:12.625
if she's to stay in her own home.

25:12.649 --> 25:15.528
Oh, dear. Sorry, Timothy.

25:15.553 --> 25:18.432
Mathematics revision.
There's a test on Monday.

25:18.948 --> 25:21.240
I'd think you'd have
more quiet upstairs.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.052
- It's Teddy's nap time.
- Ah.

25:23.077 --> 25:25.449
No, it's not ideal
having to share a bedroom.

25:25.474 --> 25:27.113
It's just about bearable.

25:27.138 --> 25:29.360
But if I'm not going to
humiliate myself on Monday,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.980
- I could do with a bit of quiet.
- Absolutely.

25:32.580 --> 25:35.280
- There is an easier way to do that equation...
- Thank you!

25:43.736 --> 25:44.815
Oh, good.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.639
I was hoping you'd pop by.

25:46.664 --> 25:48.257
Can you do yourself a fried egg?

25:48.282 --> 25:51.201
Only I want to get straight
out canvassing again tonight.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.780
Any more eggs, I'll turn into a chicken.

25:55.110 --> 25:58.196
I'll get myself a pint and
a pie down at the Black Sail.

25:58.221 --> 26:00.680
Right, spit it out.

26:01.476 --> 26:05.435
- What?
- Since I got my selection, you've had a right face on.

26:05.718 --> 26:09.558
If I didn't know better, I'd be
thinking that you weren't behind me.

26:10.113 --> 26:13.673
It's just... It's politics, Vi.

26:13.867 --> 26:17.183
The only thing that politicians
are good at is starting trouble.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.327
Look at the Cold War!

26:18.352 --> 26:21.711
Yes, but it's the Town Hall I'd
be sitting in, not the Kremlin.

26:21.942 --> 26:24.280
If you really want to make a
difference, you should sign up

26:24.280 --> 26:27.495
to do voluntary ambulance training
like me and the lads at the CDC.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.517
Cos when that bomb drops, the
emergency services are going to

26:30.542 --> 26:32.520
need all the volunteers they can get.

26:32.780 --> 26:34.019
No, thank you very much.

26:34.044 --> 26:37.280
While you're out gadding
about in the nuclear fallout,

26:37.305 --> 26:39.809
I'll be tucked up in
the shelter with Reggie.

26:39.834 --> 26:43.033
You see, that's the difference, Vi.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.965
There's them what give it all that

26:45.990 --> 26:47.334
and there's them what do.

26:47.359 --> 26:48.373
But you...

26:48.466 --> 26:50.105
..carry on.

26:55.826 --> 26:58.505
Patrick, it's gone 12.

26:59.108 --> 27:02.227
I thought we'd made a pact
that we'd all try to be in bed

27:02.228 --> 27:04.164
before the clock strikes midnight.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.978
I thought I just heard
Tim moving around upstairs.

27:07.003 --> 27:08.882
- Is he still up?
- Yes.

27:08.907 --> 27:11.725
And you know how much he
wants to study medicine.

27:12.318 --> 27:16.478
I sometimes feel like I've been
studying medicine for 35 years.

27:18.230 --> 27:21.002
It looks as though our Ghanaian lady

27:21.027 --> 27:24.173
is suffering from something
called sickle cell disease.

27:24.198 --> 27:26.908
- I've never heard of that.
- Neither had I.

27:27.161 --> 27:31.560
It seems it's a blood disease
that causes anaemia and pain.

27:31.936 --> 27:36.335
It only affects specific racial groups,
mainly Africans,

27:36.641 --> 27:37.960
so, needless to say,

27:37.985 --> 27:40.735
there's precious little
in the British textbooks.

27:42.246 --> 27:43.646
It's shameful, really.

27:45.118 --> 27:47.837
The population around here is changing.

27:48.244 --> 27:52.243
I have to be prepared to deal
with new things all the time.

27:52.268 --> 27:54.376
Patrick, you're dealing with them now.

27:54.401 --> 27:58.300
- And Mrs Aidoo's been doing very well.
- For now.

27:59.019 --> 28:01.860
And, reading this, there's
a lot more work to do.

28:05.742 --> 28:09.786
I'm going to refer Miss Millgrove
to the Meals On Wheels service.

28:10.313 --> 28:14.032
I'll also recommend additional
help for dressing and toileting

28:14.103 --> 28:16.774
and an arrangement for
emptying of the commode.

28:16.799 --> 28:19.159
You can strike that
last one from your list.

28:20.583 --> 28:23.222
Miss Millgrove is reluctant
to use the commode,

28:23.270 --> 28:24.869
but she'll get the hang of it.

28:24.894 --> 28:26.453
No, I will not.

28:26.837 --> 28:29.385
But the trek to the outside
toilet is too much for you.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.369
Don't you worry. I have my ways.

28:31.654 --> 28:34.134
And what are these
"ways", Miss Millgrove?

28:35.522 --> 28:39.960
Oh, come along, Clarice, you're not
the first and you won't be the last.

28:40.640 --> 28:42.480
Where do you put your business?

28:44.911 --> 28:48.310
This woman has parted with her reason.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.500
Remove her from my home.

28:51.678 --> 28:54.160
Normally, I'd look
for a loose floorboard,

28:54.160 --> 28:57.200
but given floor space
is in short supply...

29:00.950 --> 29:02.790
I said, get her out!

29:04.475 --> 29:06.834
No, no! Please...

29:07.265 --> 29:10.025
It was a long walk to the lavatory.

29:17.703 --> 29:19.783
It was a temporary measure.

29:26.101 --> 29:28.460
Have you been experiencing any pain?

29:29.047 --> 29:31.492
Maybe after exertion
or in the cold weather?

29:31.517 --> 29:33.356
No. Nothing.

29:33.630 --> 29:36.302
Can this sickness be cured?

29:36.327 --> 29:38.006
There isn't a cure as such.

29:38.241 --> 29:39.352
Not yet.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.454
Can a person die from this sickness?

29:42.555 --> 29:44.154
Sometimes...

29:44.195 --> 29:46.795
a person's lifespan can be shortened.

29:48.796 --> 29:51.195
You said this illness runs in families.

29:52.204 --> 29:54.102
I had an uncle in Ghana.

29:54.127 --> 29:56.842
He had pains, and died as a young man.

29:56.983 --> 30:00.702
It is possible that he had
sickle cell disease, too.

30:00.727 --> 30:04.806
But the most important thing,
Mrs Aidoo, is to look after you.

30:04.995 --> 30:06.598
And your family.

30:06.623 --> 30:08.656
Could I have given this to my children?

30:08.681 --> 30:10.118
Have they had any symptoms?

30:10.474 --> 30:12.313
Matthew's been having pains, Doctor.

30:12.338 --> 30:14.057
I thought they were growing pains!

30:14.082 --> 30:16.371
And they may still be no more than that.

30:16.396 --> 30:18.315
Children are always children.

30:18.340 --> 30:21.620
And the disease has to be
inherited from both parents.

30:24.384 --> 30:25.944
My husband is well.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.959
I think the sensible thing would
be for me to take blood from

30:30.984 --> 30:33.063
Mr Aidoo and from Matthew.

30:33.088 --> 30:35.255
I can send it to the
hospital to be tested.

30:35.280 --> 30:36.600
I do not need a test.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.423
I have the pains.

30:40.949 --> 30:43.280
In my legs. In my arms.

30:44.144 --> 30:47.249
Since I came to this country,
I suffer from them all the time.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.290
You have hid this from me?

30:50.805 --> 30:52.605
A sick husband is no husband.

30:54.917 --> 30:57.596
Without my wage, we cannot
afford to stay in England.

30:58.033 --> 31:00.273
Neither can we afford to go home.

31:03.724 --> 31:05.524
You need not test me.

31:06.150 --> 31:07.870
But you must test our son.

31:12.275 --> 31:13.793
Poor woman.

31:13.950 --> 31:15.030
The indignity.

31:16.244 --> 31:18.667
She is to be transferred
to a nursing home.

31:18.692 --> 31:21.291
I only came back to
collect spare dressings.

31:21.357 --> 31:24.260
I don't want her to be alone
when the transport comes for her.

31:25.364 --> 31:29.295
As nurses, we care for
others. To do that effectively,

31:29.320 --> 31:31.340
we must care for ourselves.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.160
And that means knowing when to stop.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.600
I understand, Sister.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.359
But, please, let me do this.

31:38.620 --> 31:41.900
I know what it is to feel that I
must leave the place where I belong.

31:48.364 --> 31:51.043
And a sticking plaster, please, Sister.

31:51.247 --> 31:54.326
Bravo, young man. Not
so much as a wobbly lip.

31:54.877 --> 32:00.419
Now, I usually have a
little something in this bag

32:00.420 --> 32:03.980
for patients who've
been particularly brave.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.017
Oh, no.

32:07.260 --> 32:08.500
Where's it gone?

32:09.437 --> 32:13.080
Oh, wait a moment... here it is.

32:13.342 --> 32:14.400
Thank you!

32:14.799 --> 32:17.657
Now, why don't you run along
while I talk to Mummy and Daddy.

32:21.270 --> 32:24.539
If it turns out that
he has sickle cell, too,

32:24.934 --> 32:27.060
we will do the very best we can for him.

32:27.931 --> 32:31.251
I'll let you know as soon
as I get the test results.

32:37.380 --> 32:39.859
I've packed enough for
the first day or two.

32:39.884 --> 32:41.758
Once you're settled, I can bring more.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.620
What will become of my possessions?

32:46.620 --> 32:49.276
You needn't worry,
they'll be taken care of.

32:49.461 --> 32:51.381
Burnt on a bonfire?

32:54.420 --> 32:56.779
Is there anything you'd
like to take with you?

32:57.404 --> 32:58.912
Anything of value?

32:59.110 --> 33:00.966
It's all of value.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.059
That's your transport arrived.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.456
I'll let the driver in.

33:17.481 --> 33:19.737
I'll see myself out, thank you.

33:20.809 --> 33:22.369
I'd like a moment.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.840
Of course.

33:25.785 --> 33:27.665
Why don't I take out your bag?

33:55.220 --> 33:58.219
Suppose this means I'll
have to get a new job, then.

33:58.220 --> 34:00.179
I suppose it does.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.380
Is she ready, nurse?

34:01.500 --> 34:04.339
The lady would like to make
her own way out of her home.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.341
She's steady on her feet
when she puts her mind to it.

34:06.365 --> 34:07.767
And don't you forget it.

34:10.530 --> 34:14.580
You'll have to carry me out
in a box! I'm staying put!

34:22.420 --> 34:23.659
Enter.

34:25.540 --> 34:26.860
Excuse me, Sister.

34:29.766 --> 34:32.725
I found a refugee on the doorstep.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.418
And I'm not quite sure
what to do with him.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.621
Good evening, Sister.

34:36.647 --> 34:39.686
I wondered if you might be
able to find me a quiet corner.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.580
I need to study and I'm
finding it hard to concentrate.

34:43.616 --> 34:48.286
Certainly. I have chores
to do, you can use my desk.

34:48.311 --> 34:49.991
Gosh. Thank you.

34:53.385 --> 34:55.143
Take as long as you need.

34:55.168 --> 34:57.528
I don't imagine having three
little ones in the house

34:57.553 --> 34:59.073
is conducive to peace and quiet.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.820
It's not the little
ones who are the problem.

35:24.820 --> 35:29.100
To every problem, there is a solution.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.219
Mr Buckle.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.979
Are we on a war footing?

35:57.980 --> 36:00.019
Big day for the Civil Defence today.

36:00.020 --> 36:03.179
The St John's Ambulance Brigade
are letting us go out with them

36:03.180 --> 36:04.939
on the ambulances.

36:04.940 --> 36:08.074
Voluntary, like, you
know, for the experience.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.714
Excellent.

36:09.849 --> 36:13.795
And how is Mrs Buckle? Excited
about the upcoming elections?

36:14.061 --> 36:16.379
Oh, well, she's the only woman standing.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.386
I don't reckon she's
got much of a chance.

36:18.411 --> 36:21.891
I'm sure whatever the result,
you'll be very proud of her.

36:27.680 --> 36:31.040
I hoped to find details of a
relative, but every address in

36:31.040 --> 36:33.360
Miss Millgrove's diary
has been scored through.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.540
Great age is no blessing.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.440
Don't mind me. I'm just
here to fix a leaky tap.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.239
Was Miss Millgrove in the war?

36:43.240 --> 36:45.439
She drove an ambulance in Serbia.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.680
May I see that, please?

36:49.840 --> 36:53.039
Hm. This is a suffragette medal.

36:53.480 --> 36:57.280
I was left very similar by my
Aunt Lillian, who was arrested

36:57.280 --> 37:00.140
and ended up on hunger
strike in Holloway.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.623
After a week, the wardens
held her down while a doctor

37:04.648 --> 37:08.808
rammed a filthy, rubber
feeding tube down her throat.

37:09.624 --> 37:13.544
Sadly, it looks as though your Miss
Millgrove could tell the same story.

37:17.664 --> 37:19.583
"Fed by force."

37:19.584 --> 37:22.223
"12.10.1912."

37:22.224 --> 37:25.023
Between her suffrage and her war work,

37:25.024 --> 37:30.019
I imagine Miss Millgrove endured
many privations in her early life.

37:31.344 --> 37:36.344
- It is no wonder she now finds comfort in plenty.
- Indeed.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.903
Lucille? Phone call for you.

37:40.904 --> 37:42.264
It's the Welfare Officer.

37:44.864 --> 37:46.224
Thank you.

37:50.424 --> 37:52.024
Is something amiss?

37:54.064 --> 37:57.463
The court has granted
an emergency order.

37:57.464 --> 38:00.040
Miss Millgrove will be removed
from her home this morning.

38:00.304 --> 38:01.980
I expected as much.

38:02.504 --> 38:03.900
It is for the best.

38:04.304 --> 38:06.460
To be taken against her will?

38:07.664 --> 38:11.743
If this is the respect to be
afforded a woman of substance,

38:11.744 --> 38:14.503
what hope is there for the rest of us?

38:14.504 --> 38:18.143
Miss Millgrove cannot
look after herself.

38:18.144 --> 38:22.343
If she is left alone in that
house, she will not survive.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.959
The court has acted out of kindness.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.119
Kindness?

38:26.120 --> 38:31.039
Will the court be so "kind"
as to banish me from my home

38:31.040 --> 38:33.719
when I can no longer care for myself?

38:33.720 --> 38:36.000
No, Sister. Your home is here.

38:38.640 --> 38:41.343
For the sake of her dignity,

38:41.440 --> 38:45.999
you must encourage her to
leave of her own accord.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.960
Nurse Anderson has already done more
than she should regarding this case.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.441
I was not one of Miss
Millgrove's number.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.620
She and her comrades
displayed courage...

38:58.320 --> 39:00.720
beyond my capabilities.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.519
But not beyond yours.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.319
Summon up that courage

39:05.800 --> 39:09.080
and do what must be done.

39:11.860 --> 39:14.579
I'm not saying they weren't brave.

39:14.580 --> 39:18.495
I'm just saying that, well, it
seems like an awful lot of bother

39:18.520 --> 39:20.279
to go to just to put an X in a box.

39:20.280 --> 39:22.439
I mean, I don't bother half the time.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.720
Especially in the local elections.

39:23.720 --> 39:28.455
To change the world one lives in,
one must start with where one lives!

39:28.480 --> 39:30.120
- Hear, hear!
- Now, now, ladies.

39:30.120 --> 39:34.095
Mr Buckle is quite within his
rights to abstain from exercising

39:34.120 --> 39:35.560
his democratic rights.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.319
Though if Mrs Buckle is pipped
to the post by only one vote,

39:38.320 --> 39:39.960
we won't want to hear any complaints.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.095
Especially if the candidate

39:42.120 --> 39:44.840
that beats her is a member
of the communist party.

39:51.840 --> 39:52.860
Yes.

39:53.580 --> 39:54.939
Thank you for calling.

39:55.220 --> 39:56.940
I'll let the family know.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.880
That was the haematologist
at St Cuthbert's.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.119
That nice little African family?

40:06.660 --> 40:09.120
I imagine you'd like me to
make them an appointment.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.860
Add them to my list for
this morning's rounds.

40:12.380 --> 40:14.720
I promised I wouldn't keep them waiting.

40:14.720 --> 40:15.840
Right.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.240
Joel?

40:34.160 --> 40:36.999
I can't... I can't...

40:37.000 --> 40:38.960
I can't...

40:45.440 --> 40:47.039
Mrs Aidoo, may I come in?

40:47.040 --> 40:48.680
My husband is very sick!

40:53.240 --> 40:54.839
This is pethidine.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.239
It might make you feel a little woozy.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.135
- I have to finish my round.
- No.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.920
You need to go to hospital.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.360
Immediately.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.239
I'll tell the Post Office
you'll be taking sick leave.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.695
No, I cannot lose my job.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.479
I have potential for advancement.

41:11.480 --> 41:14.140
There are other less
physical jobs, Mr Aidoo.

41:14.620 --> 41:16.900
And you are an educated man.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.939
When employers see
the colour of my skin,

41:19.940 --> 41:22.259
my education doesn't count for much.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.339
If you won't accept that you're ill,

41:24.340 --> 41:27.379
and you don't do everything you
can to look after your health,

41:27.380 --> 41:30.739
your wife and children are
going to find it even harder.

41:30.740 --> 41:32.720
Because they won't have you.

41:34.740 --> 41:35.940
Very well.

41:37.060 --> 41:39.740
But tell me my boy
hasn't got this thing?

41:43.860 --> 41:45.140
No.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.460
No, please, no!

42:07.400 --> 42:10.695
Haven't all of you
got better things to do

42:10.720 --> 42:13.840
than watch an old woman
being driven from her home?

42:14.280 --> 42:17.199
- It is just as I feared.
- Oh, no...

42:17.200 --> 42:18.975
Go away!

42:19.000 --> 42:21.040
Stay here. Out of the way.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.375
Come along, Miss Millgrove,
you've had your fun.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.280
If you don't let the ambulance men in,

42:26.280 --> 42:28.040
then I'm going to have to force entry.

42:29.740 --> 42:33.735
That missile may have some
unsanitary material in it.

42:33.760 --> 42:34.880
I know.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.780
And I have to tell you that there
is plenty more where that came from.

42:39.500 --> 42:42.860
Miss Millgrove, please, can we talk?

42:43.620 --> 42:44.880
Maybe I can help?

42:44.880 --> 42:47.999
Hail! Hail! Dear sister!

42:48.340 --> 42:51.459
Sister, you need to be
back at Nonnatus House.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.760
Now, you don't want to be here
when the police kick the door in.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.479
What? Is that really necessary?

42:56.480 --> 43:00.335
More than, I reckon, and I wouldn't
be surprised if they do the old girl

43:00.360 --> 43:02.200
for breach of the peace
while they're at it!

43:02.200 --> 43:04.879
I am only sorry that my vows preclude

43:04.880 --> 43:07.199
even the most peaceful protest

43:07.420 --> 43:11.360
or I would join with Miss
Millgrove in a heartbeat!

43:11.760 --> 43:14.299
And get yourself
arrested in the process.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.220
Some things are worth
standing up for, Mr Buckle.

43:18.520 --> 43:22.679
If your wife can understand
that, why can't you?

43:22.940 --> 43:26.340
All right, lads, let's
get that door down.

43:27.569 --> 43:28.949
Mind where you tread.

43:29.740 --> 43:31.600
I will not let you do this.

43:31.740 --> 43:34.899
Miss Millgrove will not be
dragged from her home by force.

43:34.900 --> 43:38.259
Nurse Anderson, if you do
not vacate that doorway,

43:38.260 --> 43:40.240
I'll be forced to arrest you.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.999
Do your worst! Vive la revolution!

43:44.000 --> 43:46.680
Can someone PLEASE get
this lady out of here!

43:48.360 --> 43:49.400
Quick!

43:52.840 --> 43:55.039
Come in, make yourself useful.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.080
I'll do parcels.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.839
You do tins.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.840
I hope you've got a good throwing arm.

44:03.400 --> 44:06.460
I'm sorry, but I can't.

44:10.520 --> 44:13.360
I... I thought you wanted to help me?

44:14.880 --> 44:16.079
I do.

44:16.500 --> 44:19.459
I want nothing more
than for you to be safe.

44:19.460 --> 44:20.680
I am safe...

44:20.680 --> 44:21.720
here.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.880
Moving to a home, it could be wonderful.

44:27.941 --> 44:31.280
You will be cared for, and there
will always be someone to talk to.

44:33.293 --> 44:34.893
You can take your books.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.780
This isn't your home any more, Clarice.

44:40.020 --> 44:41.060
Look.

44:45.820 --> 44:47.260
It is a prison.

45:02.084 --> 45:06.820
To be fed against
one's will is abhorrent.

45:08.248 --> 45:14.127
But the hunger that goes
before is almost worse.

45:14.800 --> 45:18.480
The headaches, the nausea...

45:20.002 --> 45:21.777
the cold.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.320
I can never get warm.

45:25.961 --> 45:27.641
And then the sleeplessness.

45:28.909 --> 45:30.069
So cruel!

45:31.338 --> 45:34.338
Without sleep, there's no
respite from the cravings.

45:36.759 --> 45:40.078
And then, something miraculous happens.

45:42.959 --> 45:45.880
After weeks of nothing but water...

45:47.618 --> 45:50.780
the cravings and the hunger go away.

45:52.043 --> 45:54.603
Then one is no longer
interested in food.

45:56.129 --> 45:57.609
And that's when they come...

45:58.978 --> 46:02.900
with their restraints
and their tubes...

46:04.220 --> 46:07.020
and their buckets of slop.

46:08.300 --> 46:11.940
And when their abominations are done...

46:13.500 --> 46:16.048
and there's quiet and still,

46:16.360 --> 46:21.120
one gathers oneself
together to start afresh.

46:22.561 --> 46:24.560
And the dreadful hunger...

46:26.720 --> 46:28.520
comes back again.

46:33.462 --> 46:35.022
I'm so sorry.

46:46.205 --> 46:47.820
What will become of me?

46:48.420 --> 46:50.300
I know nowhere else.

46:53.007 --> 46:55.967
I thought the same when I
left my home in Mandeville.

46:57.647 --> 47:00.007
I thought I would die from the fear.

47:03.002 --> 47:07.607
But a woman of substance
can make a life anywhere.

47:11.095 --> 47:15.820
And you, Miss Millgrove,
are a woman of substance.

47:49.432 --> 47:51.660
No, no, no, I don't need that.

47:57.158 --> 48:00.198
- Oh...
- Clumsy! - Sorry.

48:02.007 --> 48:05.500
- I bet you did a better job in your day.
- Don't patronise me.

48:05.807 --> 48:07.687
I'm only training, you know.

48:14.687 --> 48:16.887
This place they're taking me...

48:18.054 --> 48:20.373
am I allowed to eat the food?

48:20.993 --> 48:22.060
Yes.

48:22.367 --> 48:24.447
You don't need to go hungry.

48:35.807 --> 48:36.820
Well done.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.520
- Top of the class.
- Thank you.

48:42.275 --> 48:43.795
You, too.

48:50.088 --> 48:51.367
I'll visit.

48:51.392 --> 48:53.840
Tomorrow. I promise.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.359
Right, lads.

49:12.560 --> 49:19.655
I'm pleased to report that your
baby sister has put on a whole 2oz.

49:19.680 --> 49:21.799
She really is doing terribly well.

49:21.800 --> 49:25.640
Now, if I pop you back on your
mat, perhaps your big brother

49:25.640 --> 49:28.800
can help you on with
that very fetching romper.

49:34.391 --> 49:36.031
I watch for signs.

49:37.606 --> 49:41.070
When she cries, I
think "Are you hurting?

49:41.071 --> 49:45.630
"Will your life be cut short
by this sickness?" Matthew, too.

49:46.080 --> 49:47.280
He's such a happy boy.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.020
But what does his future hold?

49:49.480 --> 49:52.360
Treatments are improving all the time.

49:55.852 --> 49:59.012
The first time I set my eyes on
Joel, I knew I would marry him.

50:01.453 --> 50:03.240
Maybe if I'd known what was inside us...

50:03.240 --> 50:06.400
One doesn't choose whom
one falls in love with.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.560
No.

50:12.600 --> 50:15.240
And without him, my
life would be nothing.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.855
I refuse to believe the world is
worse for having our children in it.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.100
She's strong.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.040
Runs in the family.

50:30.887 --> 50:33.940
I'm sorry to have let you down.

50:34.800 --> 50:39.175
But I can't think of anyone
better than Mr Trotter to represent

50:39.200 --> 50:43.160
your interests in the new
Tower Hamlets Borough Council.

50:44.184 --> 50:46.640
That's not how Churchill won the war.

50:47.500 --> 50:49.059
I want to be prepared.

50:49.600 --> 50:50.840
Will the speech do?

50:50.840 --> 50:51.700
No.

50:54.599 --> 50:56.940
I've been a right idiot.

50:58.040 --> 50:59.359
I should've been behind you,

50:59.384 --> 51:01.211
but instead I've been
sniping from the sidelines.

51:01.235 --> 51:04.000
Don't ask me why, cos I
couldn't do what you're doing

51:04.000 --> 51:06.939
in a million years.
I haven't got the guts.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.639
Says the man planning
to drive an ambulance

51:09.640 --> 51:11.439
through the nuclear holocaust.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.760
Well, I'll do that any day

51:12.760 --> 51:14.959
over making a speech in the town hall.

51:15.389 --> 51:16.540
Come here.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.000
I'm proud of you.

51:20.850 --> 51:22.060
I am.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.720
Thank you, my love.

51:30.940 --> 51:32.500
Oh, thank you.

51:32.780 --> 51:34.120
See you again soon.

51:34.520 --> 51:37.160
Get your onions, cheapest in poplar!

51:54.400 --> 51:56.959
Miss Millgrove? May I come in?

51:56.960 --> 51:58.639
I brought you a present.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.301
Rhubarb with sugar, and
a little bit of salt.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.400
Maybe I'll just sit a
while and let you rest.

52:22.680 --> 52:24.440
Miss Millgrove?

53:07.960 --> 53:09.800
Was it my fault?

53:10.080 --> 53:12.720
Do you think if she'd
stayed in her own home...?

53:18.080 --> 53:21.120
We do not choose the
time of our passing.

53:22.704 --> 53:24.024
He does.

53:31.404 --> 53:35.100
I hate to think of her dying
in a nursing home on her own.

53:40.140 --> 53:42.780
She had friends around her,

53:43.312 --> 53:46.500
but had not yet had time
to make their acquaintance.

53:50.392 --> 53:53.311
Friends are everywhere,

53:53.312 --> 53:55.980
if one has the eyes to see them.

54:02.432 --> 54:04.320
I don't mind if I do.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.000
Mm!

54:25.128 --> 54:26.927
What did he say?

54:27.331 --> 54:29.960
He's offered me a job
in the sorting office.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.239
Time off for medical appointments.

54:32.240 --> 54:35.620
- Did you take it?
- I told him I needed to talk to you first.

54:37.027 --> 54:38.999
Would it be easier?

54:39.521 --> 54:42.759
If we went home? To the warmth?

54:43.008 --> 54:45.079
Home is where our dreams are.

54:45.698 --> 54:47.550
For now, those dreams are here.

54:48.120 --> 54:51.000
- So, we stay?
- We stay.

55:02.180 --> 55:05.460
She left very specific
instructions in her will.

55:14.951 --> 55:16.911
Robert Louis Stevenson.

55:42.100 --> 55:43.580
Get inside now!

56:06.895 --> 56:10.590
'Ere, where are you lot
going? Don't I get an invite?

56:10.740 --> 56:12.379
We're off to the polling station.

56:12.380 --> 56:15.540
You didn't want to come, so you
and Lucille can hold the fort.

56:19.300 --> 56:21.440
It was a year of change.

56:21.440 --> 56:25.760
A year of looking back at
the distance we had travelled.

56:26.120 --> 56:30.660
But also to the future,
the road that lay ahead.

56:33.620 --> 56:38.659
Sometimes, never letting
go becomes a letting in,

56:38.660 --> 56:40.619
an opening up.

56:40.620 --> 56:45.220
And surrender itself can
be the bravest act of all.

56:47.795 --> 56:50.155
Courage cannot move mountains...

56:51.380 --> 56:54.160
but it can show us how to climb...

56:54.380 --> 56:57.219
find a way, forge a path...

56:57.220 --> 56:58.740
that we believe in.

57:06.060 --> 57:08.500
And emboldened, we stand firm,

57:09.500 --> 57:13.419
knowing where we stand
and where we're headed

57:13.420 --> 57:15.140
and where we can belong.

57:20.100 --> 57:21.539
You see children out on the street

57:21.540 --> 57:23.539
with it covered in a
rash, spreading it around.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.099
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, please!

57:25.100 --> 57:26.419
I think my baby's dying.

57:26.420 --> 57:29.379
Do you know anything about a
rather large quantity of sand?

57:29.380 --> 57:31.420
It appears to be blocking your car.

57:33.620 --> 57:34.739
Copper!

57:34.740 --> 57:36.900
Nurse! Boy or girl?

57:38.022 --> 57:40.142
What kind of monster does that make me?

57:41.305 --> 57:47.375
