WEBVTT

00:46.296 --> 00:48.287
Come on, cover your assignments.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.298
Take your squad
and sweep the perimeter.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.960
-What's our status?
-Security breach, northeast sector.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.630
-What have the cameras picked up?
-Not a damn thing.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.890
Anything comes down this tunnel, kill it.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.142
-Got it.
-Hey. Move.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.476
-Contact?
-Ten and seven.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.310
Wait.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.816
Section F compromised.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.606
Lock it down.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.782
Section D compromised.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.916
That's only 30 meters from here.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.670
-Section C compromised.
-Twenty meters.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.176
Ten.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.301
Section B compromised.

01:41.185 --> 01:44.518
-Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
-Section A compromised.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.499
Mission accomplished.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.046
Standing by for further instructions.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.927
Vitals are steady.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.218
He didn't even break a sweat.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.225
Two minutes 18 seconds
to inﬁltrate a secured facility...

02:25.395 --> 02:28.558
...disab|e my best men,
and eliminate the target.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.065
Not a bad test run.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.817
Get some fresh guards.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.737
I wanna see him do it again.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.254
We have about a dozen people
that could do that for you.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.344
Next thing you know they'll be
brushing my teeth for me.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.976
There are some things I'd rather do
on my own.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.223
Independent and not afraid
to get her hands dirty.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.893
Two of the billion or so reasons
I fell in love with you.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.151
My shoulders are still a little bit sore.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.317
Maybe we should have
the doctor look at it.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.325
No, it's okay.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.240
Lana, you were shot.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.999
Takes more than a bullet
to stop a Luthor.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.298
Sir, Senator Burke has arrived.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.501
Show him in.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.220
You've been seeing
a lot of the senator recently.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.676
The price of doing business
with the government.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.762
Look, this will just take a minute.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.268
I'll be in the garden.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.648
-Mrs. Luthor.
-Senator.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.779
I hope I didn't interrupt
a tender moment.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.609
If you had, you'd still be waiting outside.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.405
I'm not gonna keep you
from your pretty lady. I just...

04:47.579 --> 04:49.365
...swung by for an update on Ares.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.372
Prototype is in the ﬁnal stages of testing.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.123
Everything's on schedule.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.000
Really?

04:56.380 --> 04:59.247
I heard everything
was ahead of schedule.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.214
Way ahead.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.047
I stuck my neck out to get
the Armed Services Committee...

05:04.221 --> 05:07.679
...to allow you access
to military resources and personnel.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.591
To R&D a single prototype.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.602
But you've started gearing up
for mass production.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.639
Just looking towards the future, senator.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.105
I assumed a visionary like you
would understand that.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.234
How long are you gonna be
able to keep...

05:22.406 --> 05:26.240
...what you really got going on here
a secret?

05:27.119 --> 05:29.030
See, one of my own men...

05:29.204 --> 05:31.911
...believed he uncovered a mole
right in your backyard.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.708
-Who?
-Well, | wish I could tell you.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.587
But my boy doesn't talk too good
with a bullet through his heart.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.253
Senator, if there are leaks
in my security...

05:44.428 --> 05:46.589
...I assure you I will have them
taken care of.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.756
Well, doesn't that just ﬁll me
with the warm fuzzies?

05:50.934 --> 05:55.428
Do you know what'll happen to me if the
senate got wind of what you're up to now?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.096
I assume they wouldn't care for it.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.932
Like they wouldn't care
for the money I've transferred...

06:01.111 --> 06:03.727
...into your Cayman account
over the last year.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.772
Project Ares is over.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.527
l'm shutting it down.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.610
That would be ill-advised.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.446
No.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.960
What's ill-advised is you ever opening
your mouth about our arrangement.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.418
I hear a peep out of you,
I'll make sure the committee reviews...

06:27.804 --> 06:31.217
You'll be lucky to keep that fancy shirt
on your back.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.383
We understand each other...

06:34.561 --> 06:36.142
...Luthor?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.640
Perfectly.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.548
Got the background too?

07:06.718 --> 07:08.424
-Yes.
-Great.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.508
Greetings from Patagonia,
the most beautiful place on earth.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.389
-What is that?
-What?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.142
I don't see anything.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.207
We have to talk.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.555
Clark, you should try picking up
a phone occasionally.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.557
It might be quicker, or maybe not.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.054
-What do you know about Lana?
-We||....

08:02.232 --> 08:05.850
Letting go. Never been one
of your strong points, was it?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.319
Telling the truth was never one of yours.

08:11.241 --> 08:16.656
And you're accusing me
of what exactly, this time?

08:18.248 --> 08:22.617
Lana came to me the day of the wedding
to tell me she wasn't going through with it.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.202
That she was leaving Lex.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.919
-Apparently, she changed her mind.
-Or someone changed it for her.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.428
So you think I had something to do
with her decision?

08:36.850 --> 08:40.217
lf Lana was so unhappy with Lex,
why go through with the marriage?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.519
It's surprising, Clark,
what people will do...

08:42.689 --> 08:46.432
...when they feel they have
no other options.

08:50.030 --> 08:54.114
If I ﬁnd out that you had anything to do
with Lana marrying Lex...

08:54.910 --> 08:57.117
...the gloves'll come off.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.241
How do you like that option?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.297
Triple espresso mocha-cappu-latte,
my own invention...

09:14.471 --> 09:17.258
...guaranteed to put the "zip-a-dee" back
in your "doo-dah."

09:17.432 --> 09:18.968
Thanks.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.099
Come on, it's not that bad.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.603
Jimmy is coming back. One day.

09:26.483 --> 09:30.021
Maybe. You know, besides, distance
is good for the relationship.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.902
That's what all the guys
who've moved away from me said.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.815
Lois, you should really stick
to investigative reporting...

09:35.992 --> 09:37.983
...and out of the advice column.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.485
That's the plan.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.913
Hey, Smallville. Love to hear
about the cows and the corn...

09:47.087 --> 09:50.170
...but I got a lead on a dirty senator
that needs to be hosed down.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.252
-See you on the front page.
-She going after a senator?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.008
I guess so.
She hasn't told me much about it.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.465
There's a lot of that going around lately.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.347
Was that jab directed at my chin?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.135
I went to Lionel to ask about Lana.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.304
-What did he say?
-Nothing.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.722
Just like you.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.443
-C|ark, |--
-Chloe, you know what Lex is really like.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.397
Do you forget what he did to you,
what he did to your mother?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.991
No, I haven't forgotten.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.996
-I don't want anything to happen to Lana.
-Neither do I.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.657
If she's staying in that marriage,
all I can say is...

10:27.836 --> 10:29.622
...she must have
a damn good reason.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.428
You sure about this?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.338
Got a reservation.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.008
Eats here every time he's in town.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.890
Thanks for the tip.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.937
-Senator Burke.
-Howdy, miss.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.982
Lois Lane, reporter.
I was hoping to ask a few questions.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.742
Sure. Schedule an interview
with my ofﬁce.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.663
You know, I tried to,
but no one returned my calls.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.418
Well, that ought to tell you something,
sweet cakes.

11:13.965 --> 11:17.549
Senator, last year your salary
was $150,000.

11:17.719 --> 11:22.713
Can you tell me how you managed to
deposit $5 million in a Cayman account?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.932
What paper did you say
you worked for, Miss...?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.518
Lane. Lois Lane.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.603
I'm a reporter for The Inquisitor:

11:34.778 --> 11:36.439
The Inquisitor?

11:36.613 --> 11:38.820
That's not a newspaper.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.777
That's a cat box liner.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.946
Get her out of here.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.111
Hey. Get your hands off me,
you fascist.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.450
I'm warning you, if you don't—

12:13.650 --> 12:16.483
Oh, my God. Wes?

12:39.843 --> 12:41.834
-Chloe, what's going on?
-You haven't heard?

12:42.011 --> 12:43.672
-Senator Burke was murdered.
-What?

12:43.847 --> 12:45.587
Yeah, Burke was in bed
with la familia.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.097
He crossed them,
they gave him the Fredo treatment.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.554
-It was a mob hit.
-Al| evidence points to that.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.014
But there is one witness
who doesn't think so.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.305
-Lois?
-Thanks.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.069
What happened to you?

13:02.866 --> 13:07.735
Well, one minute I was harassing
a public ofﬁcial and the next...

13:07.912 --> 13:10.369
...he came out of nowhere, like a ghost.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.872
Burke and his men never had a chance.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.291
You saw who did this?

13:16.171 --> 13:18.708
Yeah, I did more than see him, Clark.
I know him.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.461
Name's Wes Keenan. We were
army brats together when we were kids.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.842
I'm running a check on his name.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.546
Looks like he works for the mob now.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.182
Wes? No way.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.719
He's career military. He's been decorated
more than a Christmas tree.

13:34.898 --> 13:38.140
Even my dad loved him,
and the general hates everybody.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.525
Lois, you sure the man you saw
is Wes Keenan?

13:40.695 --> 13:44.904
I haven't seen him for years, but he has
this little scar above his right eye and—

13:45.283 --> 13:47.399
Trust me, it was Wes.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.656
Not according to the US government.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.617
He was in a helicopter crash
in Afghanistan four months ago.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.406
He was killed in action.

13:58.213 --> 14:02.627
No. That is not possible.
I know what I saw.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.297
-What else does it say?
-Nothing.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.259
I mean, his military records
have been classiﬁed.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.232
-What is that?
-His alpha wave just spiked for a second.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.272
It's probably just feedback
from the implants in his cortex.

14:27.450 --> 14:30.408
-Probably?
-lt's nothing to worry about.

14:30.578 --> 14:34.116
Everything's still holding
within operational parameters.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.076
Make sure it stays that way.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.785
Sir.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.955
We just received information
that Burke has been eliminated.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.121
Evidence trail?

14:44.300 --> 14:47.463
Leads straight back to the mob,
per your instructions.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.753
But there's been a complication.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.057
-There was a witness.
-Nothing...

14:54.227 --> 14:56.468
...can get in the way
of completing this project.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.475
Nothing.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.106
Take care of it.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.649
You heard the man. Prep him.

15:26.968 --> 15:31.007
Lois, quit being stubborn. You're gonna
stay here until we get this cleared up.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.307
Thanks, but I can take care of myself.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.011
Nobody's doubting that,
but you'd be safer here.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.097
It'll be like old times,
like when you ﬁrst got to Smallville.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.014
You're just hoping to catch me
in the shower again.

15:44.527 --> 15:48.440
I mean, thank you. I really appreciate it.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.699
Well, you're always welcome here, Lois.
You're practically family.

15:54.162 --> 15:58.246
Well, since I'm being a burden,
can I just ask one more favor?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.031
What do you need?

16:01.628 --> 16:04.210
Your mom's political inﬂuence.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.545
Do you think you could use
your connections...

16:10.720 --> 16:12.961
...to get a look at Wes' military jacket?

16:13.139 --> 16:15.881
-I thought you said the ﬁle was classiﬁed.
-It is.

16:16.559 --> 16:17.719
I contacted the general...

16:17.894 --> 16:21.011
...but he went all cold war on me
and said that I should drop it.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.895
Well, he might have a point.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.727
Three men are already dead.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.060
Which is why I have to get my hands
on that ﬁle.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.396
It might explain why Wes is doing this.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.901
Well, I've made a few friends
in Washington.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.697
I don't know if they can help,
but I'll see what I can do.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.406
Thanks, Mrs. K.

16:45.421 --> 16:49.084
I know that look. It's usually followed
by you almost getting yourself killed.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.750
Well, this isn't just another story, Clark.
Not this time.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.590
Wes and I...

16:54.764 --> 16:56.174
...we were close.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.180
I know it was him.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.969
Stay here.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.191
Looks like it was just the wind.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.405
Clark, watch out!

17:24.711 --> 17:26.121
Wes.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.929
How could Lois have been kidnapped
with you right there?

17:47.108 --> 17:50.566
-She just vanished, Chloe. Literally.
-So he could teleport, like Alicia?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.479
It was different. It was more
like Graham Garrett could do.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.990
-So he turned himself invisible.
-Not just himself. He took Lois with him.

17:58.161 --> 18:01.494
And it's not his only ability.
And when he hit me....

18:01.664 --> 18:05.452
Chloe, I haven't felt anything like that
since I went up against Titan.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.623
-C|ark, we need to ﬁnd Lois before Wes--
-We will.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.215
Have you uncovered anything that might
help us ﬁgure out where he took her?

18:14.385 --> 18:17.673
I haven't been able to retrieve
information from the military ﬁles.

18:17.847 --> 18:22.307
But I did run a crosscheck on his name
and I found one hit: Jodi Keenan.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.266
Jodi Keenan?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.644
The woman that tried to kill
Lex in the tunnels?

18:26.814 --> 18:28.770
-Guess who she's married to.
-Wes?

18:29.650 --> 18:32.687
Look like Jodi found out
that Wes wasn't killed in Afghanistan.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.446
And she followed the trail
all the way back here, to Lex.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.403
Okay, so Wes is exhibiting
multiple krypto-abilities.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.862
And according to Lois...

18:41.037 --> 18:44.700
...he's also on the receiving end
of some sort of mind control.

18:44.874 --> 18:48.958
How much do you wanna bet that all of this
plays into Lex's 33.1 experiments?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.414
Chloe, I need you to contact Oliver
and his team.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.706
They've been taking out 33.1
facilities all around the world.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.217
-lsn't that a hero-to-hero phone call?
-l'm going to talk to Lex.

18:58.387 --> 19:02.096
Clark, come on. We both know
that Lex isn't gonna tell you anything.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.096
Then I'll ﬁnd somebody who will.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.993
Too much?

19:25.748 --> 19:27.454
No, it's....

19:30.795 --> 19:33.252
I thought maybe if I set the mood....

19:36.300 --> 19:37.756
Or maybe not.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.884
Lex—

19:54.318 --> 19:55.694
Sorry to bother you, sir.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.939
The asset failed to return.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.330
I'll be right back.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.048
Lana.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.722
-You shouldn't be here. Lex is just outside.
-I had to see you.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.552
Clark.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.767
It's not about you and me.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.765
Lois is in trouble.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.808
And what makes you think I can help?

20:37.987 --> 20:40.319
Because it seems there's a connection
to Lex.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.279
Lana".

20:42.450 --> 20:46.318
...have you seen or heard anything?
Maybe something about the military?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.112
Ares.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.659
That's the god of war.

20:53.336 --> 20:58.171
Lex has been talking with Senator Burke
about this military project called Ares.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.879
Yesterday, he threatened to shut it down.

21:03.012 --> 21:06.345
-Maybe you should talk with him.
-I can't.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.016
Senator Burke is dead.

21:09.018 --> 21:12.181
He was murdered by the same man
who has Lois.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.688
Lana, is there anything else?

21:15.858 --> 21:18.270
Maybe something that Lex let slip?

21:19.695 --> 21:24.155
One of his men was just saying something
about an asset that failed to return.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.858
An asset?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.949
That's what the military
calls its soldiers.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.158
Lex is connected to this.

21:36.712 --> 21:40.170
Whatever reason you had to go through
with the wedding, it was wrong.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.707
You have no idea what he's capable of.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.961
You'd be surprised what I know.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.885
Then why are you still here?

21:55.564 --> 21:58.431
We all have our secrets, Clark.

21:59.568 --> 22:03.857
Sometimes we have to keep them
to protect the people that we care about.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.530
Lanauu

22:10.538 --> 22:12.074
I know.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.463
Lana?

22:28.889 --> 22:30.470
You okay?

22:30.641 --> 22:33.929
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just a little chilly.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.314
Look, something's come up.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.185
I need to go into the ofﬁce.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.611
Don't wait up.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.247
Wes.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.873
Designation incorrect.
Call sign: Ares, prototype, Mach four.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.459
You don't remember me, do you?

23:46.717 --> 23:48.673
It's Lois.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.293
Lois Lane?

23:51.097 --> 23:54.055
My father is General Sam Lane.

23:54.433 --> 23:59.769
And when I was a kid, he used to drag me
around to all the bases he was stationed at.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.804
One of them was Fort Avelson.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.352
Where I met you.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.520
Do you remember
how you got that scar?

24:10.032 --> 24:14.196
You used to tell everybody
that you got it falling off your dirt bike.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.531
But that's not how it happened.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.157
We got into the general's whiskey...

24:21.752 --> 24:24.289
...then we broke
into the storage warehouse.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.329
We were wrestling around, being stupid.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.083
And I kissed you.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.671
The ﬁrst time I ever kissed anybody.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.888
And you smiled your crooked smile...

24:42.398 --> 24:46.391
...and then you puked and passed out,
and cracked your head open on the ﬂoor.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.690
Never could handle your liquor, Wes.

24:58.581 --> 24:59.912
-Mission incomplete.
-No.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.038
Eliminate target.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.880
Now, why did you bring me here?

25:07.756 --> 25:10.088
Think, Wes.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.592
This is Fort Avelson. okay?
This is the warehouse.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.299
This is where I kissed you that night.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.717
Remember me.

25:47.630 --> 25:48.619
Mr. Luthor.

25:48.797 --> 25:52.210
Three years and a billion dollars spent on
Ares. You tell me you lost him?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.591
We're in uncharted territory here,
Mr. Luthor.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.629
Synthesizing multiple meteor abilities
is difﬁcult enough.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.967
But stringing together
the molecular chain...

26:00.142 --> 26:03.600
...with peptides extracted
from that creature that Bartlett recovered--

26:03.771 --> 26:07.810
The only thing that allows all these
abilities to exist in one subject.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.146
Titan's genetic material was the key
to making this project viable.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.187
Which makes the results
as unpredictable as the substances...

26:14.365 --> 26:15.821
...l'm being asked to work with.

26:15.991 --> 26:19.108
You're being asked
to help protect the world, doctor.

26:19.286 --> 26:23.370
Unstable criminals with dangerous powers
are becoming more and more common.

26:23.540 --> 26:27.829
Humanity's only chance of surviving
the onslaught is this project.

26:28.003 --> 26:32.167
So kick that big brain of yours in high gear
and ﬁgure out what the hell went wrong.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.206
Something might have triggered
a decay...

26:34.385 --> 26:36.842
...in his memory blocks,
a familiar place or person—

26:37.012 --> 26:38.297
Can't you get a ﬁx on him?

26:38.472 --> 26:42.181
The ﬁeld he generates makes it impossible
to track him electronically.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.518
I want our dog back on his leash, doctor.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.305
Or you'll be my next experiment.

26:51.777 --> 26:55.440
Maybe I could reposition
the LuthorCorp satellites.

26:56.824 --> 27:01.238
Generate a broad spectrum pulse that will
hopefully reinitiate his command directives.

27:01.412 --> 27:04.495
-But there's no guarantee.
-l'm not asking for guarantees.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.701
I'm asking for results.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.333
I want Ares back online
and his mission completed.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.045
Start the pulse.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.811
I killed a United States senator?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.361
What happened?

27:41.702 --> 27:43.863
How did you end up like this?

27:49.293 --> 27:52.535
I was stationed in Afghanistan.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.332
Our convoy hit an IED.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.088
And then I woke up
in a military hospital.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.922
-That's when Luthor showed up.
-Lex?

28:06.435 --> 28:08.266
I should've known.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.936
He forced you into this, didn't he?

28:12.107 --> 28:14.519
He offered me a way
to keep serving my country.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.934
By turning you
into a brain-dead assassin?

28:17.863 --> 28:20.445
You think this is what I signed on for?

28:20.616 --> 28:23.779
He told me Project Ares was gonna help
soldiers protect themselves.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.863
So they wouldn't end up like I did.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.745
We won't let him get away with this,
I promise you.

28:28.916 --> 28:33.410
Okay, we will expose Lex
and Project Ares--

28:36.382 --> 28:40.466
-What is it? Wes?
-lt's them.

28:41.261 --> 28:44.253
They're trying to get back into my head.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.217
Fight it. Just look at me.
Look at me.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.633
Run. Run!

29:10.249 --> 29:13.491
Lex was experimenting on Wes,
trying to make him into a super soldier.

29:13.669 --> 29:16.832
With pick-and-choose meteor powers,
Oliver told me the same thing.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.290
-Oliver knew about Wes?
-No.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.751
He found an earlier model
in the Utah desert.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.635
This isn't the ﬁrst time one of
Lex's souped-up Rambos has gone AWOL.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.341
-Was he able to stop him?
-Barely.

29:26.515 --> 29:29.848
It took the equivalent of a mini nuke
to break through his force ﬁeld.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.350
-Even if you ﬁnd him--
-Maybe this will help.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.513
-Wes' military jacket.
-How did you get that?

29:35.691 --> 29:38.774
Called in a few favors and had to promise
a couple dozen of my own.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.356
Lois was right. Wes was a hero.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.192
He took her instead of killing her.

29:44.366 --> 29:47.449
If whatever programming they're using
to control Wes is failing...

29:47.619 --> 29:49.484
...he'll go back to a place
he remembers.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.200
Somewhere he lived or was stationed.

29:54.376 --> 29:57.539
The military base Wes grew up on
was decommissioned a few years ago.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.544
Fort Avelson, outside of Metropolis.

29:59.715 --> 30:03.048
Sam Lane was stationed there when Lois
was in junior high. Maybe—

30:07.806 --> 30:10.969
-Do you ever get used to that?
-Not really.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.079
Wes?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.087
You have to ﬁght this.

30:48.055 --> 30:50.387
Don't let them do this to you again.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.592
You are not a murderer.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.394
Please.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.100
Wes.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.994
Wes?

32:37.748 --> 32:40.410
System damage.

32:41.376 --> 32:46.245
Return protocol, three, eight,
ﬁve, two, nine...

32:46.423 --> 32:48.960
-...ﬁve, three, two--
-Wes.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.921
Three, eight--

32:55.057 --> 32:56.672
Lois.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.354
You're gonna be ﬁne.
Do you understand me?

33:01.521 --> 33:04.058
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna go get help, all right?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.688
No.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.941
Better this way.

33:10.072 --> 33:13.280
They'll never stop trying...

33:13.450 --> 33:14.906
...to control me.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.739
You have to stay with me.
Do you hear me?

33:18.705 --> 33:22.414
Don't let them do this...

33:22.584 --> 33:25.121
...to anyone else.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.246
-Okay?
-Okay. I promise.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.257
But you just stay with me, okay?
Don't leave me.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.255
Wes?

33:38.809 --> 33:40.140
Wes?

33:41.812 --> 33:43.348
No. No.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.479
Wes?

33:47.943 --> 33:49.524
Wes.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.356
Come on.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.603
Don't leave me.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.289
How does this happen?

34:12.634 --> 34:16.001
Wes wanted to serve his country
and wound up being used as a pawn.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.841
It happens more than I like to think.

34:19.307 --> 34:21.639
Well, now that Senator Burke is gone....

34:21.810 --> 34:24.927
Burke isn't the only one on the hill
lining his pockets.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.063
Wherever there's power, there'll be men
like Lex to exploit it.

34:28.233 --> 34:31.191
Maybe you can do something.
Maybe open an investigation or....

34:31.361 --> 34:34.194
Clark, I'm a little ﬁsh in a tiny pond.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.821
My inﬂuence doesn't reach nearly
that far up.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.654
Then perhaps it's time to extend
that inﬂuence.

34:42.247 --> 34:44.659
I just got off the phone
with the governor.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.996
We were talking about your ﬁlling
Burke's senatorial seat...

34:48.170 --> 34:50.502
-...until the next election.
-Me?

34:50.672 --> 34:54.506
Kansas needs to be represented
by someone of unassailable character...

34:54.676 --> 34:58.635
...who can restore the faith
that Burke has tarnished.

34:58.805 --> 35:04.016
The governor agreed. You are
the perfect choice for the US Senate.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.189
Clark.

35:09.483 --> 35:11.064
You agree?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.617
You should do it, Mom.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.822
I think you should do it.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.462
And I think Dad
would have wanted you to.

35:33.215 --> 35:35.877
|-- I can't move to Washington.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.258
We're barely keeping the farm running
as it is.

35:38.428 --> 35:40.635
Clark can take care of that.
Can't you, Clark?

35:45.227 --> 35:47.388
I can lease out the back 40
to Ben Hubbard.

35:47.562 --> 35:49.302
He's been wanting to work that land.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.516
Oh, Clark—

35:53.026 --> 35:55.642
You and Dad always taught me
to put other people ﬁrst.

35:57.239 --> 36:00.322
To use my abilities
to help those in need.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.734
You have the chance
to affect so many people.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.163
To change so many lives
if you go to Washington.

36:10.085 --> 36:13.452
That's where you need to be if you
really wanna make a difference, Mom.

36:16.758 --> 36:19.500
And that's where people like Wes
need you to be.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.520
I don't care what it takes.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.603
I want the body transported
to the lab immediately.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.688
Make it happen.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.780
Hey. You're up.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.782
For a while now.

36:45.287 --> 36:46.743
You never came home last night.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.529
There was an unforeseen complication
with Project Ares.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.739
Ares?

36:51.918 --> 36:56.457
The secret military project I was discussing
with Senator Burke yesterday.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.130
When you were listening
outside the door.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.886
Lex, I'm sorry.

37:09.811 --> 37:14.305
There is no excuse.
My curiosity got the best of me.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.229
You're not a cat, Lana.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.903
Don't skulk around like one.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.117
It won't happen again.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.159
Every time I've opened my heart
to someone I care about...

37:36.588 --> 37:39.330
...l've ended up being very disappointed.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.502
|f--

37:42.928 --> 37:45.510
If you ever betrayed me...

37:46.806 --> 37:48.967
...I don't know what I'd do.

37:52.228 --> 37:55.015
I'd never hurt the man I love.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.814
Of course not.

38:03.823 --> 38:08.066
But if there's anything you ever
wanna know about my business dealings...

38:09.537 --> 38:10.788
...just ask.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.197
No secrets?

38:15.710 --> 38:17.541
No secrets.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.633
Mrs. Kent goes to Washington.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.595
If anyone can give Jimmy Stewart
a run for his money--

38:32.769 --> 38:34.555
ljust wish Lionel wasn't helping her.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.937
Think the king of ulterior motives has
something up his Armani sleeve?

38:38.108 --> 38:39.188
When doesn't he?

38:39.359 --> 38:42.101
Just right now, his son's
a bigger problem.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.189
That's the understatement
of the century.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.070
We've always know
Lex has a dark side.

38:46.241 --> 38:49.529
With what he's been doing recently,
we're heading towards pitch-black.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.536
I'll make sure Lana's nowhere
near him when the lights go out.

38:52.706 --> 38:55.163
Hopefully he'll be behind bars
long before that.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.073
Lois is meeting the feds
at the morgue.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.994
And once they connect
Wes' body with Lex...

39:00.171 --> 39:02.662
-...and then Burke's murder—
-Don't hold your breath.

39:02.882 --> 39:03.917
Wes' body's gone.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.252
What about the feds? What did they say
when you told what happened?

39:08.763 --> 39:09.923
I work at The Inquisitor.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.135
You know, aliens, Bigfoot, Elvis.
What do you think they said?

39:13.309 --> 39:17.928
As far as they're concerned, Wes Keenan
died in action four months ago.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.392
Just like it said in his ﬁle.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.228
He deserved better than this.

39:23.445 --> 39:24.730
Lois, I'm sorry.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.028
Don't be sorry for me.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.064
Be sorry for Lex.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.279
He's gonna pay for what he did to Wes.

39:32.454 --> 39:36.117
And I'm gonna make damn sure
that he doesn't do this to anyone else.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.470
You were almost perfect.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.354
Take him apart.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.026
I wanna know what went wrong...

40:04.194 --> 40:06.685
...so we don't make
the same mistake next time.

40:06.863 --> 40:10.651
Quantitating the abnormality
won't do us any good, Mr. Luthor.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.908
We used up nearly everything
we harvested from Titan.

40:14.079 --> 40:18.072
There aren't enough alien peptide
sequences to continue the project.

40:18.708 --> 40:21.871
I'm already working on procuring
a replacement.

40:23.296 --> 40:27.505
I promise you, doctor,
this isn't the end of Project Ares.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.840
This is just the beginning.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.262
