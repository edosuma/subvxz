01:07.667 --> 01:08.988
I loved Halloween.

01:09.582 --> 01:13.780
Okay, not a huge surprise there. I mean, what kid doesn't love Halloween?

01:14.856 --> 01:19.074
But my devotion to the day was not for the obvious reasons.

01:19.345 --> 01:21.450
I couldn't care less about the candy.

01:21.787 --> 01:24.253
And I didn't give a shit about the costumes.

01:24.715 --> 01:26.794
I loved Halloween because

01:27.071 --> 01:30.039
I loved looking into other people's houses.

01:37.493 --> 01:39.610
Why's the candy outside?

01:39.714 --> 01:41.708
They probably don't want to be disturbed, sweetie.

01:41.770 --> 01:43.983
But it's Halloween, it's supposed to be disturbing.

01:44.044 --> 01:45.169
Maybe they're just not home.

01:45.237 --> 01:46.937
That's a bunch of bull-- they're home!

01:50.166 --> 01:51.901
Trick or treat, damnit!

01:55.951 --> 01:58.948
Just take a piece of candy and let's go to the next house.

01:59.299 --> 02:00.385
Hello!

02:00.724 --> 02:02.112
I know you're in there!

02:02.168 --> 02:03.602
George, listen to your mother.

02:05.903 --> 02:08.664
This is ridiculous. Every other kid is in it for the candy.

02:08.806 --> 02:10.877
So? She's curious. Curious is good.

02:11.313 --> 02:15.894
Hey, Georgia, I have a feeling the next house is going to be giving out gummy worms.

02:16.677 --> 02:19.075
And I think they're going to let you see inside.

02:19.524 --> 02:21.458
There's barely any furniture.

02:21.997 --> 02:23.773
Maybe some weirdo lives here.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.407
Honey, you're being the weirdo.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.496
We're leaving. Come if you want.

02:28.703 --> 02:29.666
Fine!

02:41.388 --> 02:42.232
Boo!

02:43.784 --> 02:47.567
Halloween is when the freaks came out of the shadows.

02:48.288 --> 02:50.734
Now that I'm older... and deader,

02:50.831 --> 02:53.865
I see that Halloween is amateur night for death.

02:53.929 --> 02:55.961
"Ooh, look at me, I'm bleeding."

02:56.079 --> 02:58.615
"Ooh, look at me, someone hit me with an ax."

02:58.992 --> 03:01.189
Trick or treat.

03:01.271 --> 03:04.574
You know, I've seen one of those in real life and let me tell you something--

03:04.937 --> 03:06.417
not so funny.

03:06.939 --> 03:09.453
I'm not a prude. It's just unseemly.

03:09.529 --> 03:11.906
A man's home is a man's castle.

03:11.998 --> 03:15.853
In his castle, he should be allowed to swing free.

03:15.894 --> 03:17.820
There are boundaries. Mason,

03:17.885 --> 03:19.902
other people can see them. Why can't you?

03:19.969 --> 03:21.044
Nude is natural.

03:21.248 --> 03:22.288
Nude is now.

03:22.391 --> 03:24.975
I'm about to eat breakfast, so can we ease up on

03:25.037 --> 03:27.352
the naked talk? Please? Thank you.

03:27.423 --> 03:29.087
You didn't have to see it, Georgia.

03:29.246 --> 03:30.936
It's not how I wanted to start my day.

03:31.018 --> 03:35.195
Well, you screaming at 6:53 in the morning was not how I wanted to start mine.

03:35.278 --> 03:36.932
By the way, you're not the first woman

03:37.034 --> 03:41.492
who has shrieked at the sight of the loch ness monster rising to the surface.

03:41.591 --> 03:42.709
Don't flatter yourself.

03:42.844 --> 03:46.225
Okay, folks, two rules starting as of right now.

03:46.445 --> 03:50.822
One. Breakfast at our house is no longer clothing optional.

03:50.915 --> 03:53.037
- All meals.
- All meals.

03:53.115 --> 03:55.522
- Fine.
- Two, and most important--

03:55.628 --> 03:59.753
you touch my fucking pop tarts again and your "monster" is going to get it in his sleep.

03:59.815 --> 04:00.396
Fine,

04:00.447 --> 04:02.735
and F.Y.I., I like strawberry frosted the best.

04:02.803 --> 04:06.114
In addition to eating my groceries, you might want to start providing them.

04:06.182 --> 04:07.313
You need to earn your keep.

04:07.385 --> 04:09.484
I-- all right!

04:09.744 --> 04:11.952
All right... I--I'll do some chores.

04:12.007 --> 04:13.861
Okay, fine, do some chores.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.247
Do my fucking laundry.

04:16.437 --> 04:17.625
I don't think so.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.683
Do you like candy?

04:18.755 --> 04:21.305
- Everyone likes candy.
- Excellent. Well, this is what I'm going to do.

04:21.339 --> 04:25.841
I'm going to get so much candy tonight, we're going to have a whole year's supply in our house.

04:25.892 --> 04:29.124
You're going to have so much candy, you're going to be begging for candy mercy.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.038
Oh, I'm going to start now.

04:30.099 --> 04:32.922
- Kids, over here. Kiddies, here.
- No, Mason, don't bring children near us.

04:33.584 --> 04:34.848
Okay, listen.

04:35.088 --> 04:37.147
We're going to play a little Halloween game.

04:37.638 --> 04:39.829
Now, I'm going to ask you a question,

04:40.095 --> 04:41.811
and you are going to answer me.

04:41.918 --> 04:43.552
If you get it right, you get a dollar.

04:43.639 --> 04:45.297
If you get it wrong, I get your candy. All right?

04:45.716 --> 04:47.662
Right. Question--

04:48.389 --> 04:53.949
what original member of the Rolling Stones croaked whilst having a drowning accident?

04:54.093 --> 04:55.025
Mick Jagger.

04:55.116 --> 04:57.314
No, he's kind of alive and still touring.

04:57.851 --> 04:58.757
Keith Moon?

04:58.840 --> 04:59.525
No!

04:59.616 --> 05:01.038
That's the fucking Who.

05:01.271 --> 05:01.932
Who?

05:02.038 --> 05:02.930
The Who.

05:03.004 --> 05:05.101
It's Brian Jones, now hand over the candy.

05:07.753 --> 05:08.716
Now piss off.

05:10.001 --> 05:13.446
I partied with him, and I reaped him. Yes!

05:13.989 --> 05:15.341
Stealing candy from children?

05:17.520 --> 05:19.318
Mm. Challenging.

05:19.764 --> 05:20.997
You've come a long way, mason.

05:21.136 --> 05:22.355
It's Halloween, Ruby.

05:22.606 --> 05:24.234
Worse things will happen today.

05:24.818 --> 05:26.287
In fact, they will.

05:27.644 --> 05:28.217
You.

05:28.754 --> 05:29.244
You.

05:30.867 --> 05:31.586
And you.

05:32.950 --> 05:34.064
Give me a little room, huh?

05:43.449 --> 05:46.520
And you... might want to wear this.

05:46.628 --> 05:49.131
Um... I know I'm the youngest one here,

05:49.238 --> 05:51.629
but I don't trick-or-treat.

05:51.892 --> 05:53.381
No, no. Reaper legend--

05:53.524 --> 05:56.637
the dead will appear as themselves on Halloween.

05:56.735 --> 05:58.926
So, in theory, I can be...

05:59.033 --> 05:59.900
recognized.

06:00.057 --> 06:01.281
I've never bought that.

06:01.537 --> 06:03.135
I don't care whether you buy it or not.

06:04.312 --> 06:08.109
Open yourself to the possibility that there are people out there who knew you when you were alive

06:08.219 --> 06:10.441
and who can see you today as you were.

06:10.543 --> 06:12.488
I've been dead for over 60 years.

06:12.596 --> 06:13.778
I'm not talking to you.

06:14.706 --> 06:16.440
She's dead a year, in her hometown.

06:16.579 --> 06:18.059
Yeah, it's nonsense, okay?

06:18.146 --> 06:21.356
And why would you want to put this exquisite face behind a mask?

06:21.709 --> 06:27.629
Yeah. And these strappy things get caught in my hair. It's very painful.

06:30.075 --> 06:31.356
- Wow.
- Wow.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.977
Nice...

06:33.272 --> 06:34.694
I'm undercover today,

06:35.119 --> 06:36.231
and I don't want to hear it.

06:36.317 --> 06:37.178
Roxy,

06:37.597 --> 06:40.025
your dress makes me feel funny in my pants.

06:41.149 --> 06:42.368
I'm armed,

06:42.492 --> 06:43.485
and you're not.

06:43.576 --> 06:45.543
Do we have to go down this road again?

06:45.609 --> 06:46.202
No.

06:46.337 --> 06:48.398
Just curious-- where is your firearm?

06:54.777 --> 06:56.884
What exactly are you supposed to be?

06:57.130 --> 06:58.239
I'm Roxy,

06:58.604 --> 07:00.953
the bad-ass witch of the northwest.

07:06.561 --> 07:11.276
Hey... both of our post-its are at 59 past the hour.

07:11.338 --> 07:12.218
Mine, too.

07:12.310 --> 07:13.752
Why isn't she wearing a mask?

07:13.886 --> 07:14.935
Fucks with her hair.

07:16.124 --> 07:17.495
Happy Halloween.

07:20.384 --> 07:22.027
- Happy Halloween.
- Bye.

07:23.972 --> 07:24.674
How much?

07:26.158 --> 07:27.255
- Okay.
- Boo!

07:30.829 --> 07:32.072
Keep the change, Kiffany.

07:32.353 --> 07:34.310
Is that reaper legend really true?

07:34.611 --> 07:37.562
Well, it's as true as you want it to be.

07:38.196 --> 07:40.193
What, that's it? That's all you got?

07:40.296 --> 07:43.904
I could march right up to my old house and ask my sister for a kit kat.

07:44.154 --> 07:45.071
You could.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.608
What's stopping me?

07:46.992 --> 07:47.907
I don't know.

07:48.404 --> 07:49.505
What is stopping you?

07:55.009 --> 07:56.842
Something happened to you.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.532
I don't know what you mean.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.297
You're the paternal one.

08:01.778 --> 08:02.859
Is that what I am?

08:03.294 --> 08:05.560
Yes. Daisy's the starlet,

08:05.607 --> 08:06.750
Mason's the screw-up,

08:06.801 --> 08:08.000
Roxy's...

08:08.526 --> 08:09.387
Roxy,

08:09.591 --> 08:10.456
and you're...

08:11.225 --> 08:12.350
you're the dad.

08:14.613 --> 08:17.121
Well, paternal didn't turn out to be such a good gig.

08:19.441 --> 08:21.141
You want advice from me, is that what you want?

08:25.633 --> 08:26.973
Hey, wear running shoes today.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.458
Trick-or-treating's a real grind.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.160
Boo!

08:35.595 --> 08:37.075
I have to go to Happy Time.

08:38.164 --> 08:39.046
It's sunday.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.145
I left my running shoes there.

08:41.258 --> 08:42.357
I'll come with you.

08:43.331 --> 08:45.792
- Roxy's the mother.
- Excuse me?

08:45.911 --> 08:47.739
She reminds me of my mother.

08:50.059 --> 08:52.245
She reminds me of my mother.

08:52.505 --> 08:53.617
Was she a cop?

08:54.563 --> 08:55.950
She could have been.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.797
Oh, these seeds are gross.

09:02.944 --> 09:03.801
Slimy.

09:04.231 --> 09:06.433
Wait till they're toasted. You'll love them.

09:06.510 --> 09:08.163
Why can't I carve the pumpkin?

09:09.248 --> 09:10.677
Maybe next year.

09:10.886 --> 09:12.253
That's what you said last year.

09:13.026 --> 09:15.084
Why don't you go get your costume ready for tonight?

09:15.141 --> 09:16.856
I'm not going trick-or-treating.

09:18.714 --> 09:20.055
But you love candy.

09:20.982 --> 09:22.098
I'm over it.

09:24.587 --> 09:26.829
Your sister went trick-or-treating every year,

09:27.797 --> 09:28.979
and she took you.

09:30.557 --> 09:32.390
I'll bet she'll be out there tonight.

09:32.559 --> 09:33.337
Reggie.

09:33.844 --> 09:34.893
It's Halloween--

09:35.497 --> 09:37.376
the night when ghosts walk the earth.

09:40.857 --> 09:43.013
Okay, I'm bringing this up in therapy today.

09:43.256 --> 09:44.814
Dana's coming in as a favor.

09:45.887 --> 09:47.610
I was just kidding.

09:48.854 --> 09:49.868
Oh. Okay.

09:51.647 --> 09:52.756
Were you?

09:55.961 --> 09:57.830
We can go trick-or-treating tonight if you want.

09:58.450 --> 09:59.243
Fine.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.352
Are you going to wearyour Pochahontas outfit?

10:01.543 --> 10:03.453
I think I'm going to go as a ghost.

10:03.523 --> 10:04.855
We don't have a ghost costume.

10:05.209 --> 10:07.384
Ghosts don't wear costumes.

10:08.096 --> 10:10.594
They look just like you and me.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.273
One Halloween, when I was a little kid,

10:18.359 --> 10:21.126
my dad pulled out a knife to carve our pumpkin...

10:22.195 --> 10:24.444
I totally lost it, I started to cry,

10:24.526 --> 10:26.368
begged him not to hurt the pumpkin.

10:27.751 --> 10:29.824
My mom and dad told me to calm down.

10:30.921 --> 10:34.519
They told me the scary stuff on Halloween was all make-believe,

10:34.858 --> 10:36.188
that no one would get hurt,

10:36.274 --> 10:37.571
least of all the pumpkin.

10:38.743 --> 10:41.281
I mean, they're your parents.

10:41.502 --> 10:43.140
You have to trust your parents.

10:45.182 --> 10:47.288
And then I let them kill the pumpkin.

10:52.424 --> 10:53.594
What the fuck?

10:53.704 --> 10:55.521
Every year. Every year.

10:56.248 --> 10:57.523
I hate Halloween.

10:58.378 --> 11:02.832
Every jackass with a 50-cent mask thinks he has a license for mayhem and tomfoolery.

11:02.887 --> 11:04.070
Already today,

11:04.153 --> 11:09.467
I had a dead cat and a bag of flaming shit on some old lady's doorstep.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.017
Flaming shit.

11:11.198 --> 11:12.190
That's a classic.

11:13.133 --> 11:16.758
This princess garb is so uncomfortable. I'm taking this off.

11:16.824 --> 11:19.272
No, no, no, Roxy, that makes the whole ensemble.

11:19.943 --> 11:21.254
God, you look great.

11:21.596 --> 11:23.747
Maybe I will put a costume together.

11:24.469 --> 11:25.302
Be right back.

11:25.365 --> 11:29.159
If you keep eating all the candy, how are we going to have a year's supply left by the end of the evening?

11:29.255 --> 11:33.920
Well, if you'll come with me on my little trip of controlled chaos, then you'll see.

11:35.964 --> 11:37.099
I'm in.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.461
Just out of respect for the evening.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.162
Yeah?

11:42.032 --> 11:45.081
It's hoodlums like you that make my job so difficult.

11:45.158 --> 11:46.607
Oh, Roxy.

11:47.047 --> 11:48.578
Let me explain something to you.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.906
The universe, in all of its infinite wisdom,

11:52.029 --> 11:55.664
allows the forces of destruction one evening a year

11:55.720 --> 11:57.036
to have full reign.

11:57.274 --> 11:58.859
On all hallows' eve,

11:59.437 --> 12:00.692
you can get away with anything.

12:00.743 --> 12:02.187
Can we look in people's houses?

12:02.274 --> 12:03.027
Yes.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.669
Can't bloody wait!

12:08.259 --> 12:09.907
One can get away with murder.

12:46.294 --> 12:48.198
I never believed in fairies.

12:48.317 --> 12:50.114
I never clapped for tinkerbell,

12:50.602 --> 12:52.811
and I was never scared of ghosts.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.969
But maybe there was more to Halloween than milk duds and vandalism.

12:58.117 --> 13:01.469
Maybe there was a reason for me to stay in the shadows.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.678
Now, that's almost definitely bullshit.

13:06.522 --> 13:08.368
Hello, happy time!

13:12.759 --> 13:15.115
It's so strange that you were here, Millie.

13:15.267 --> 13:16.334
I am here.

13:16.465 --> 13:17.096
No,

13:17.992 --> 13:19.031
I mean before.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.359
Now it's almost like you're haunting the place.

13:24.089 --> 13:25.021
What are you doing?

13:25.958 --> 13:28.463
I am stealing these for candy-gathering purposes.

13:31.832 --> 13:34.574
Well, could you ease up on the larceny? I work here.

13:34.662 --> 13:38.266
I am simply testing for candy-gathering capacity.

13:39.463 --> 13:40.508
We have a winner.

13:41.465 --> 13:42.269
Lovely.

13:42.915 --> 13:44.435
I was watching T.V. Last night,

13:44.506 --> 13:48.762
some cops and robbers and lawyer bullshit.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.149
Yeah, I know, I heard you.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.224
You woke me up.

13:51.317 --> 13:53.201
It was some law and order rerun bullshit,

13:53.297 --> 13:57.476
and, uh, there was a detective asking questions to a perp, right?

13:57.553 --> 14:00.063
And it always bloody annoys me so fucking much,

14:00.129 --> 14:02.699
because it's the same fucking question again and again and again.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.515
"Did you know the deceased?"

14:04.576 --> 14:05.401
Exactly--

14:05.488 --> 14:07.782
"did you know the deceased?"

14:08.950 --> 14:09.804
Come on.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.849
I mean, everybody in the whole fucking world knows the answer is "no."

14:13.942 --> 14:14.965
The answer is always "no."

14:15.038 --> 14:16.906
- Always "no." No, no, no, no.
- Okay, I got it.

14:17.664 --> 14:19.476
I think they should ask us that question.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.012
"Did you know the deceased?"

14:21.064 --> 14:22.576
"No, I didn't know the bloody deceased,

14:22.629 --> 14:23.778
"because I've just met her

14:23.853 --> 14:24.929
"I'm about to reap her,

14:24.995 --> 14:27.079
"and she's going to die in three minutes."

14:28.963 --> 14:30.361
Like you did, here.

14:30.439 --> 14:33.239
I was here a couple of hours.

14:33.787 --> 14:35.921
A morning, actually,

14:36.494 --> 14:38.123
and no one knew me.

14:42.639 --> 14:45.035
I don't want to know the deceased. Never have.

14:45.198 --> 14:46.929
Yeah, me either.

14:47.227 --> 14:50.247
I only want to know people who've been dead a long time.

14:50.329 --> 14:51.516
Me, too.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.542
Except for you.

15:01.715 --> 15:04.137
Nice costume, Crystal.

15:05.114 --> 15:06.021
Spooky.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.705
Nice mask, Millie.

15:08.771 --> 15:09.702
Thanks.

15:12.556 --> 15:14.059
What've you got there, Crystal?

15:15.042 --> 15:15.820
Nothing.

15:15.933 --> 15:19.230
Is it a... trick-or-treating map?

15:21.549 --> 15:25.436
Have you got prime candy zones highlighted?

15:26.966 --> 15:28.498
Mason, let's go now.

15:30.105 --> 15:33.653
- Happy Halloween, Crystal.
- Let's go, Mason.

15:48.040 --> 15:52.034
Death is like going to your first haunted house when you were a kid...

15:53.621 --> 15:57.722
You had to walk through it to figure out what stuff was really scary,

15:58.696 --> 16:01.280
and what stuff was just in your head.

16:01.372 --> 16:04.183
So, how are we on this Halloween sunday?

16:09.106 --> 16:10.777
How are you feeling about the dog?

16:10.854 --> 16:12.205
The dog has a name.

16:13.593 --> 16:14.560
J.D.

16:15.846 --> 16:17.633
How are you feeling about J.D.?

16:19.874 --> 16:21.340
Where's the candy?

16:21.699 --> 16:22.573
Reggie.

16:22.932 --> 16:25.826
What? Crazy girls don't need a little chocolate?

16:27.924 --> 16:29.261
You know, Reggie,

16:29.701 --> 16:32.076
holidays can be a lot of fun, but

16:32.189 --> 16:34.042
they're also emotionally difficult,

16:34.108 --> 16:36.621
and it's hard not to think about your family.

16:37.666 --> 16:38.803
About George.

16:41.854 --> 16:43.616
Well, did george like Halloween?

16:47.584 --> 16:49.345
George loved Halloween.

16:50.425 --> 16:53.528
She liked spying on other people.

16:55.244 --> 16:59.437
Reggie thinks that george continues to spy on other people.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.458
She thinks that she's a ghost.

17:04.994 --> 17:06.506
Is that true, Reggie?

17:06.589 --> 17:08.421
Do you think your sister, George, is a ghost?

17:09.159 --> 17:10.111
No.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.971
Yes, you do think she's a ghost. She thinks she's a ghost.

17:14.453 --> 17:16.256
No, I don't. I'm not crazy.

17:16.342 --> 17:17.603
I believe in ghosts.

17:17.684 --> 17:19.194
Do you think that makes me crazy?

17:20.731 --> 17:24.739
I'd like to talk about my parents' divorce and how that's destroyed my childhood.

17:24.846 --> 17:27.325
I'm paying $160 an hour here, okay?

17:27.425 --> 17:30.800
And I would like to discuss the fact that Reggie thinks her sister is living among us.

17:30.871 --> 17:32.636
I don't think George is a ghost.

17:32.710 --> 17:33.256
She's lying.

17:33.358 --> 17:34.456
No, I'm not.

17:34.701 --> 17:38.521
Uh--I did. But I changed my mind.

17:41.413 --> 17:42.326
Okay.

17:43.918 --> 17:47.441
Do you know what? I've got a secret stash of little Kit Kats in the other room,

17:47.507 --> 17:48.894
under the coffee table.

17:48.982 --> 17:50.236
Want to go grab a few?

17:50.472 --> 17:51.198
Sure.

18:00.337 --> 18:01.156
Joy...

18:01.780 --> 18:04.300
I understand your frustration, I do,

18:04.427 --> 18:07.664
but I really want to encourage you to not to put so much pressure on yourself

18:07.730 --> 18:08.862
or on Reggie.

18:09.527 --> 18:13.516
Just try to let the process be a little more organic.

18:14.509 --> 18:16.727
I can't afford organic.

18:18.016 --> 18:20.550
Dana, you're a very good therapist,

18:20.950 --> 18:22.358
you're a very smart woman,

18:23.034 --> 18:24.826
but I can't afford to come here.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.976
I can't even afford to park here.

18:27.123 --> 18:30.333
Okay, maybe we can work out some kind of a sliding scale.

18:33.181 --> 18:37.226
I don't really think that therapy is going to bring my daughter back.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.942
Which daughter are you trying to bring back?

18:59.742 --> 19:02.144
You're a little taller than the other trick-or-treaters.

19:02.584 --> 19:04.239
Candy bar or fruit roll-up?

19:05.226 --> 19:06.752
How about a moment of your time?

19:14.056 --> 19:15.226
No sales!

19:15.297 --> 19:16.778
I'm not selling anything.

19:17.704 --> 19:19.404
Go away.

19:21.252 --> 19:23.244
I'm with, uh, Candy Busters, inc.

19:23.285 --> 19:26.218
I'm just trying to educate the public on the perils of sugar.

19:26.351 --> 19:27.994
You picked the wrong night!

19:28.598 --> 19:33.105
Well... it's one of the few nights people will open their door to strangers.

19:34.579 --> 19:35.766
Question one...

19:36.989 --> 19:40.998
rate the apple as a Halloween treat-- healthy alternative or liberal cop-out?

19:44.199 --> 19:45.525
Cop-out. Next question.

19:45.772 --> 19:47.640
Let me get your name. Uh...

19:49.042 --> 19:50.118
M. Feldman?

19:50.476 --> 19:51.906
Josie Feldman.

19:58.702 --> 19:59.953
Last question...

20:01.391 --> 20:02.400
did you know

20:02.938 --> 20:05.151
candy kills more people than cigarettes?

20:05.343 --> 20:06.583
I don't believe that.

20:09.891 --> 20:11.202
Good luck with your survey.

20:12.225 --> 20:13.172
Where're your folks?

20:13.307 --> 20:15.558
They're in Barbados, trying to recapture their youth.

20:16.276 --> 20:21.099
Well... maybe you should take in these newspapers.

20:22.349 --> 20:25.874
Criminals see this, it's like an invitation.

20:26.019 --> 20:27.313
Come on. This neighborhood?

20:32.075 --> 20:33.350
You have a lame job.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.345
I want to thank you for your time.

20:36.432 --> 20:38.316
Hey, you want to take some candy for your kid?

20:38.450 --> 20:39.417
I don't have a child.

20:39.514 --> 20:40.140
Come on.

20:40.805 --> 20:43.206
Take a Snickers for the road. Sugar rocks.

20:45.561 --> 20:46.841
Can I give you some advice?

20:46.948 --> 20:47.599
Sure.

20:48.049 --> 20:49.575
Enjoy that cigarette.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.544
In a way, death was kind of like a door-to-door salesman.

20:59.251 --> 21:02.257
Most people weren't too interested in what we were selling.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.256
Or they just didn't want to make that kind of

21:06.476 --> 21:08.063
long-term commitment.

21:29.651 --> 21:31.127
So we trick them.

21:40.870 --> 21:41.891
You okay?

21:44.942 --> 21:46.034
Come on.

21:48.229 --> 21:50.057
You think you're tough, don't you?

21:50.983 --> 21:51.669
What?

21:51.777 --> 21:54.649
You think you're a bad ass in your little get-up.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.536
I could have played a cop, Roxy, a cop with a heart of gold.

21:57.613 --> 22:00.966
It's not the outfit, Daisy. Being tough is in here.

22:01.048 --> 22:03.470
- I'm tough.
- Oh, yeah, real tough.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.176
You're real imposing.

22:05.328 --> 22:07.956
It's very easy for you, Roxy. You are armed.

22:08.652 --> 22:10.270
I need a gun, too.

22:11.023 --> 22:12.455
A girl needs accessories.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.267
The only accessory I have is my attitude.

22:15.338 --> 22:16.531
Oh, then, uh, give me your gun.

22:16.634 --> 22:17.105
No.

22:17.166 --> 22:17.755
Please?

22:17.945 --> 22:18.492
No.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.797
Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

22:20.863 --> 22:22.823
Jesus christ, you're like Mason.

22:22.904 --> 22:25.316
- You are not a cop.
- And you're not a princess.

22:26.110 --> 22:27.753
And don't you fucking forget it.

22:28.476 --> 22:29.301
Thank you.

22:30.124 --> 22:32.137
Oh, you forgot to charge me for my coffee.

22:32.735 --> 22:34.164
Coffee's free for cops.

22:35.890 --> 22:39.412
See the kind of an actress I am? It's just effortless.

22:40.017 --> 22:41.977
Yeah, it was.

22:44.548 --> 22:48.489
Hey, old man, take a picture, it lasts longer.

22:52.243 --> 22:53.370
You see, Roxy?

22:53.425 --> 22:57.197
Take away the uniform, you're just another pretty face. You have no authority.

22:59.563 --> 23:00.285
Hey.

23:00.536 --> 23:02.144
You gonna stand there gawking

23:02.200 --> 23:05.585
or am I going to have to drag your ass to the station house?

23:05.727 --> 23:06.613
This is fun.

23:07.304 --> 23:10.306
Perhaps you didn't hear me, grandpa, I said--

23:10.393 --> 23:12.011
Daisy Adair.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.816
I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.

23:17.984 --> 23:20.908
Gone with the wind. She died during the filming.

23:21.410 --> 23:23.524
You're the spitting image of her.

23:23.733 --> 23:24.517
Oh.

23:25.271 --> 23:27.066
Well, good for me.

23:27.309 --> 23:31.234
I used to see miss Adair come into the stork club every night.

23:31.302 --> 23:33.002
Usually with a different gentleman.

23:33.319 --> 23:35.693
All of them, or most of them, stars.

23:35.966 --> 23:38.069
Well, I'm not her.

23:39.509 --> 23:40.626
Obviously.

23:45.535 --> 23:48.081
Halloween is one fucked-up day.

23:54.638 --> 23:55.964
Give me the gun.

23:59.030 --> 24:01.427
This looks like a chocolate house, maybe even caramel.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.508
How do you know?

24:02.574 --> 24:05.374
The nice decorations and caramel-chocolate wrapper in the front.

24:05.431 --> 24:06.275
Get out of the way!

24:06.347 --> 24:08.277
Wait your fucking turn. Get to the back!

24:08.421 --> 24:09.640
I'm not scared of you.

24:10.428 --> 24:11.228
You either.

24:11.309 --> 24:14.616
You're three-and-a-half-feet tall with an earring and a sash, so back off.

24:14.683 --> 24:15.435
Yeah.

24:22.075 --> 24:25.797
Ooh. What scary creatures have come to my door?

24:25.864 --> 24:27.139
That's for us, then? Cheers.

24:27.292 --> 24:29.836
Uh, Mason-- dry... ice.

24:43.643 --> 24:45.161
Jesus, that was cold.

24:46.558 --> 24:49.262
- And what are you?
- A ghost.

24:49.764 --> 24:53.106
- Ah. And you?
- Ghost.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.179
Good job, guys. Way to go all out. "A" for effort.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.496
Thank you. Can we have some bloody candy now, or what?

25:02.349 --> 25:04.622
- Go for it.
- Get out of here.

25:04.724 --> 25:05.687
Come on, piss off.

25:06.744 --> 25:08.544
Oh... hi, Frank.

25:09.685 --> 25:11.258
Debra's in the zebra room.

25:25.935 --> 25:28.070
Oh, that's just not right.

25:39.511 --> 25:40.707
Happy Halloween!

25:41.096 --> 25:43.401
Obviously, I'm a couple years past trick-or-treating age,

25:43.472 --> 25:46.685
but I had to compliment you on these gorgeous decorations.

25:46.931 --> 25:49.824
May I offer you my oregano-dusted pumpkin seeds?

25:50.009 --> 25:50.746
Ah!

25:53.383 --> 25:54.325
Lovely.

25:55.702 --> 25:57.221
You must be mrs. Clark.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.676
You're a neighborhood legend.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.069
You can call me Katie.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.927
You do beautiful work, Katie.

26:06.055 --> 26:08.384
Are there any problems in the area, officer?

26:08.888 --> 26:12.327
Tell me those awful Stuart boys didn't defecate in my wishing well again.

26:12.384 --> 26:14.416
No, no, just making sure everyone's safe.

26:14.755 --> 26:16.449
Kids today are so ill-mannered.

26:16.525 --> 26:17.385
Hooligans.

26:17.482 --> 26:19.137
I adore Halloween.

26:19.986 --> 26:23.619
And I will continue to create elegant decorations and

26:23.814 --> 26:26.652
healthy snacks until the day I die.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.386
Good luck with that.

26:53.302 --> 26:54.899
I just cleaned those cupboards.

26:54.970 --> 26:56.025
Please don't touch them.

26:57.330 --> 26:59.024
Stop cleaning. I'm hungry.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.835
Honey, you know I'm going to start showing the house again.

27:05.088 --> 27:06.844
I know you don't like it.

27:07.268 --> 27:08.764
That's just how things are.

27:10.583 --> 27:11.651
Knock knock.

27:15.087 --> 27:17.395
- Happy Halloween.
- Hey, Suzanne.

27:20.437 --> 27:21.875
Sugar skull?

27:24.020 --> 27:25.254
I just had lunch.

27:27.329 --> 27:28.752
So how're you doing, Reggie?

27:30.394 --> 27:31.341
I'm fine.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.273
So sorry to hear about your doggie.

27:36.831 --> 27:37.712
Thanks.

27:39.805 --> 27:40.963
So, these...

27:41.152 --> 27:42.903
are for dia de los muertos--

27:43.701 --> 27:45.206
day of the dead.

27:45.642 --> 27:48.862
It's sort of the mexican version of Halloween.

27:49.604 --> 27:54.127
Everyone gathers and they go to the cemetery where their loved ones are buried.

27:54.361 --> 27:56.921
It's actually--it's the day after Halloween.

27:56.989 --> 27:57.602
Suzanne...

27:57.710 --> 27:59.839
No, this is not morbid at all, Joy.

28:00.188 --> 28:01.883
This is celebratory,

28:02.061 --> 28:07.268
and there's song and dance, and food and music and candles.

28:07.341 --> 28:08.927
It's a real hoot.

28:09.414 --> 28:11.416
That's sweet. Thanks for the treats.

28:11.518 --> 28:14.676
And I'm having a dia de los muertos party at my place tonight.

28:14.748 --> 28:15.987
You're both invited to come.

28:16.249 --> 28:17.968
It's going to be a very mellow vibe.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.785
Some tequila and flan.

28:21.485 --> 28:23.273
Some older single men.

28:23.826 --> 28:25.045
We'll try to come by.

28:31.747 --> 28:33.856
You know, I was remembering George today,

28:33.999 --> 28:35.524
in her little ghost costume.

28:37.123 --> 28:38.515
I miss seeing her.

28:40.335 --> 28:42.739
Well, feliz dia de los muertos, honey.

28:44.929 --> 28:45.922
Please come.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.804
Two by two, kids.

28:55.876 --> 28:59.404
Do you see how Antonio's holding the lion's hand?

28:59.480 --> 29:00.940
That's the Halloween spirit.

29:01.002 --> 29:04.360
Charlie, if you can't keep your hands off that dinosaur's tail,

29:04.433 --> 29:06.556
you're going back to the shelter early.

29:09.445 --> 29:12.438
Hey, man, you want to get some candy?

29:16.232 --> 29:17.891
We can catch up with them later.

29:18.045 --> 29:22.299
Does, uh, oh, does anyone have to, uh, make a wee-wee?

29:25.976 --> 29:27.133
Trick or treat?

29:28.326 --> 29:30.385
Hey, you're a cute guy, huh?

29:30.783 --> 29:31.496
There you go.

29:32.006 --> 29:33.850
Those are bourbon candies.

29:34.623 --> 29:37.388
Well, my mother used to give them to me when I was kid.

29:37.486 --> 29:38.126
Sir...

29:39.519 --> 29:42.303
it's illegal to give alcohol to minors.

29:42.416 --> 29:43.599
Aw, shit.

29:43.931 --> 29:45.340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:45.442 --> 29:46.620
I just... I'm sorry.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.292
I just hate holidays, you know?

29:49.420 --> 29:51.279
So goddamn lonely...

29:51.847 --> 29:53.802
Would you mind telling me your name, sir?

29:54.130 --> 29:54.976
Les...

29:56.537 --> 29:58.646
Blandon. Should I go get the bathrobe?

29:58.775 --> 30:02.312
No. There'll be no arrest tonight, mr. Blandon.

30:03.055 --> 30:04.385
Take care of yourself.

30:06.788 --> 30:07.979
Thank you.

30:09.619 --> 30:12.996
Come on, phantom man, let's hit the trails.

30:18.543 --> 30:19.647
There we go.

30:19.728 --> 30:20.918
Kate, did you see which way--

30:21.003 --> 30:26.616
Charlie! My god! You gave us a scare.

30:26.693 --> 30:28.490
Lose one of your group, did you?

30:28.781 --> 30:31.557
Yes, and I just did a buddy count.

30:31.660 --> 30:32.903
Well, everyone's fine.

30:32.975 --> 30:35.325
Why don't you just move on to the next house, then?

30:35.402 --> 30:36.647
Is there something wrong, officer?

30:36.677 --> 30:38.269
Is there some chatter on the line?

30:38.350 --> 30:41.135
No, just some guy giving out bourbon bonbons.

30:41.223 --> 30:45.693
Liquor chocolates were my gateway drug. They are no joke.

30:45.765 --> 30:46.763
Bag check!

30:47.217 --> 30:48.380
Let's see...

30:50.127 --> 30:51.197
No joke.

30:57.370 --> 30:58.242
Okay...

30:58.377 --> 31:00.398
Thank you, officer.

31:00.567 --> 31:03.834
Come on, kids, let's keep going.

31:04.555 --> 31:05.756
Any time.

31:05.962 --> 31:08.784
That's it, stay close. Stay close.

31:19.065 --> 31:21.538
- That's one scary guy.
- Yeah.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.898
That's the thing with Halloween.

31:24.154 --> 31:27.790
I wouldn't have loved it so much if there was nothing to be afraid of,

31:27.979 --> 31:31.312
if some of the houses I peered into weren't haunted.

31:31.655 --> 31:33.319
You all right there, chief?

31:33.447 --> 31:35.148
Yes. I am on a mission.

31:36.713 --> 31:40.869
Oi! You, no. This is my reap, and therefore, my doorbell ring.

31:41.889 --> 31:44.152
- Well, then, have at it.
- Thank you.

31:52.036 --> 31:54.178
The address and the time are the same.

31:54.235 --> 31:55.693
That's kind of ironic, isn't it?

31:56.803 --> 31:58.539
Hello, little man. Trick or treat?

31:58.785 --> 31:59.783
What are you?

32:00.245 --> 32:03.260
Me? Uh, well, um... have you ever heard of a brit?

32:03.832 --> 32:04.735
Well, I'm a brit.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.334
So you're a little devil?

32:07.544 --> 32:08.389
Yeah.

32:08.558 --> 32:09.496
What's your name?

32:09.731 --> 32:10.560
Bobby.

32:10.636 --> 32:11.938
Bobby, is your dad in?

32:12.024 --> 32:13.372
Richard, or Raymond, or...

32:13.421 --> 32:15.608
He went out to get me some cough medicine.

32:15.679 --> 32:17.569
- Are you sick?
- Yeah.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.546
No trick-or-treating this year.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.986
Shit.

32:29.065 --> 32:30.360
Now, you little devil...

32:32.141 --> 32:37.158
I am thinking that maybe your parents sometimes call you Robert,

32:38.029 --> 32:39.355
Robert Perlis, right?

32:39.452 --> 32:40.096
Yeah.

32:45.740 --> 32:47.440
Know what I'm going to do for you, Bobby?

32:47.828 --> 32:49.847
I am going to open up my big bag here,

32:50.142 --> 32:52.754
and I'm going to let you pick any--anything,

32:52.826 --> 32:54.905
anything you want, seriously. Come on.

32:55.176 --> 32:56.030
Anything.

32:56.819 --> 32:59.665
I'm not supposed to take candy from people I don't know.

32:59.783 --> 33:01.018
Come on, little man.

33:01.093 --> 33:04.238
You know me. I'm a brit, I'm not a monster, am I? Come on, choose.

33:07.385 --> 33:09.981
Now, that is a bloody good choice, Bobby, I'm telling you.

33:10.058 --> 33:11.516
Open your arms out. Go on.

33:12.767 --> 33:14.930
Can you handle all of this or waht ? There you go.

33:19.926 --> 33:20.999
Thanks.

33:22.164 --> 33:23.268
Hey. Come here.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.305
Happy Halloween.

33:40.670 --> 33:41.479
Hey.

33:44.853 --> 33:45.724
How do you--

33:45.866 --> 33:47.505
how do you think he's going to...

33:51.032 --> 33:54.001
God, you don't think he's going to choke on that candy I gave him, do you?

34:20.920 --> 34:22.386
Come on, George, let's go.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.842
That's the confusing thing about Halloween--

34:34.085 --> 34:36.379
you were supposed to be a little scared,

34:36.965 --> 34:39.706
and you were supposed to open your door to strangers.

34:40.260 --> 34:41.980
Does that make any sense?

34:44.435 --> 34:46.014
Well? Does it?

34:48.982 --> 34:51.754
All right, little man, come with me. Yeah.

34:54.279 --> 34:56.634
Better to be just a little scared.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.195
- How do I look?
- Embarrassing.

35:14.953 --> 35:17.318
- What is that smell?
- Shit. Pumpkin seeds.

35:17.396 --> 35:18.168
Reggie!

35:21.419 --> 35:23.227
Oh! Christ!

35:36.277 --> 35:37.495
Pumpkin seeds.

35:51.762 --> 35:53.280
Reggie, what the fuck?

35:54.186 --> 35:55.922
No need to drop the f-bomb.

35:55.998 --> 35:57.196
What were you thinking?

35:57.755 --> 35:59.444
I forgot about them. I'm sorry.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.331
Look what you did to my kitchen. I mean, this is a disaster.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.934
It's not.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.995
- Reggie, this is unbelievable!
- Worse things have happened, mom.

36:11.707 --> 36:15.111
You always go crazy over the stuff that doesn't even matter.

36:23.789 --> 36:27.993
Then why don't you put on a costume and come with me, over to Suzanne's party?

36:28.530 --> 36:29.606
I want to stay here.

36:29.724 --> 36:31.504
Just come with me.

36:31.684 --> 36:33.542
I'll stay here and hand out candy.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.339
I don't think that's a very good idea.

36:36.599 --> 36:38.259
It's just Halloween, mom.

36:40.014 --> 36:41.336
It's not a big deal.

36:42.369 --> 36:43.152
Fine.

36:49.727 --> 36:51.037
I'll have my phone with me.

36:52.004 --> 36:53.802
- It's on, okay?
- Okay.

36:55.114 --> 36:58.303
I'll come back soon, and then we can...

36:59.920 --> 37:02.869
we can answer the door together, okay?

37:03.083 --> 37:03.740
Sure.

37:09.253 --> 37:10.360
It'll be a hoot.

37:19.913 --> 37:22.786
I don't remember every single moment about being a kid...

37:23.299 --> 37:25.345
but I sure remember Halloween.

37:27.061 --> 37:30.458
The stuff that sent my heart racing had nothing to do with ghouls

37:30.500 --> 37:33.608
or goblins or witches  or even ghosts.

37:33.824 --> 37:38.596
The stuff that scared me was what was lurking behind all those closed doors,

37:38.866 --> 37:41.709
all those secrets hiding in the dark...

37:55.550 --> 37:58.338
You really want to know how to scare the crap out of yourself?

37:58.465 --> 38:01.220
Some Halloween night, go ring the wrong doorbell.

38:07.124 --> 38:07.989
Yes?

38:08.204 --> 38:10.650
Why don't you give out candy like a normal person?

38:11.610 --> 38:16.574
Well, young lady, I left a bowl, and you kicked it over.

38:16.774 --> 38:18.168
Come on, George, let's go!

38:19.975 --> 38:21.855
Georgia, come on!

38:22.073 --> 38:23.185
I have to go.

38:23.774 --> 38:24.721
All right.

38:25.515 --> 38:27.555
But come back next year.

38:29.517 --> 38:33.173
If most people knew how many times they brushed by death,

38:33.353 --> 38:36.839
they'd probably stay inside for the rest of their lives.

38:39.897 --> 38:42.932
Or at least they wouldn't knock on this dark door.

38:53.061 --> 38:54.283
Trick or treat.

38:54.940 --> 38:56.330
I don't have any candy.

38:57.605 --> 38:59.603
I see your candy right there.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.332
I know you.

39:13.774 --> 39:14.860
It's done.

39:16.098 --> 39:18.013
It's all over.

39:23.604 --> 39:24.618
Who are you?

39:26.369 --> 39:28.289
Nobody you want to know.

39:35.978 --> 39:37.939
I didn't know how he was going to die.

39:38.488 --> 39:41.933
And to tell you the truth, I really didn't give a shit.

39:42.252 --> 39:45.227
Some of the dead are just better left forgotten.

39:52.431 --> 39:55.261
Reggie, we can go back to the party,

39:56.217 --> 39:57.498
we can go home...

40:00.228 --> 40:02.612
I'll do whatever you want. I am just...

40:03.713 --> 40:05.049
not comfortable...

40:06.314 --> 40:07.216
here.

40:09.227 --> 40:10.686
It's too disturbing.

40:13.426 --> 40:15.499
It's supposed to be disturbing.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.407
It's Halloween in a graveyard.

40:18.945 --> 40:20.480
It's the day of the dead.

40:21.992 --> 40:23.369
You know, Reggie, actually,

40:23.593 --> 40:27.217
dia de los muertos is tomorrow.

40:27.597 --> 40:31.616
Suzanne said it's the one day when spirits visit the earth.

40:31.688 --> 40:33.955
Yeah, and that one day is actually tomorrow,

40:34.033 --> 40:36.035
as in the daytime, hmm?

40:36.879 --> 40:38.836
And Suzanne smokes a lot of pot.

40:40.367 --> 40:41.365
Let's go home.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.432
You didn't even go trick-or-treating this year.

40:53.475 --> 40:55.531
That makes me sad.

40:56.069 --> 40:57.457
I'm done with it.

40:58.501 --> 41:01.490
Is it because george always used to take you trick-or-treating?

41:05.074 --> 41:06.559
And ignored me.

41:15.253 --> 41:16.139
Come here.

41:18.424 --> 41:20.609
Come keep your mother warm.

41:37.934 --> 41:38.774
Fucking bullshit.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.441
I don't like almonds and coconut in my chocolate.

41:41.523 --> 41:42.270
I do.

41:42.879 --> 41:43.945
Make me an offer.

41:44.057 --> 41:47.458
Uh, milk duds and a candy bar to be named later?

41:47.555 --> 41:48.367
Okay.

41:49.121 --> 41:51.421
- Black licorice-- totally gross.
- Who wants to trade?

41:56.837 --> 41:57.804
Fine.

41:58.654 --> 41:59.678
Be that way.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.260
Hey, Rube,

42:05.904 --> 42:08.295
sure you don't want anything?

42:08.777 --> 42:11.126
Halloween's for kids. You guys have it.

42:11.321 --> 42:14.066
I have to admit, Mason, this is an impressive haul.

42:14.133 --> 42:15.617
Thank you very much, Daisy.

42:16.088 --> 42:17.573
You must've really worked hard.

42:18.367 --> 42:19.431
You don't know.

42:20.096 --> 42:22.882
- Anyway, thanks.
- You're welcome.

42:26.562 --> 42:27.724
Come on, Rube.

42:27.797 --> 42:30.264
I know you love sweets. Have something.

42:30.921 --> 42:33.536
I wouldn't mind a little peanut brittle, peanut.

42:36.251 --> 42:40.249
That's not who I am anymore, I'm not that girl.

42:40.684 --> 42:41.759
No, you're not.

42:42.794 --> 42:44.964
Well, happy Halloween anyway...

42:45.660 --> 42:46.659
peanut.

42:49.322 --> 42:50.791
Well, it's not Halloween anymore.

42:50.996 --> 42:51.875
It's tomorrow.

42:51.972 --> 42:52.920
All saints' day.

42:53.049 --> 42:54.738
Is that a special one, too?

42:54.952 --> 42:56.397
Do I have to wear a mask?

42:56.488 --> 43:01.593
Legend has it that spirits gather in graveyards on all saints' day.

43:01.679 --> 43:03.078
That's where they honor the dead.

43:03.176 --> 43:04.624
How will you be spending it?

43:05.924 --> 43:07.328
In a graveyard.

43:08.767 --> 43:09.831
Good night, guys.

43:10.471 --> 43:11.203
Bye.

43:19.420 --> 43:21.294
I always thought I loved Halloween

43:21.360 --> 43:24.427
because I got to look behind all those closed doors,

43:25.216 --> 43:29.292
but now I see that it's because I was painted with something darker...

43:30.659 --> 43:32.911
that I was meant to see the dark,

43:33.777 --> 43:35.620
and through the dark...

44:07.735 --> 44:09.618
I'm not supposed to be here...

44:10.640 --> 44:11.899
but I am.

44:12.756 --> 44:15.377
I don't know if I'm supposed to watch over them,

44:16.303 --> 44:17.976
or just haunt them.

44:42.538 --> 44:46.275
Either way, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having fun.

44:47.555 --> 44:50.580
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to be here...

44:53.030 --> 44:56.330
walking through a graveyard the day after Halloween,

44:56.775 --> 45:00.124
on a quiet and beautiful november morning...

45:00.891 --> 45:02.607
It's not so bad...

45:02.765 --> 45:04.655
being dead like me.

45:06.304 --> 45:11.861
