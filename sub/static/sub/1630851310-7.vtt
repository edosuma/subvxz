WEBVTT

00:23.420 --> 00:26.420
I thought you said nobody came here.
Nobody does.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.860
Oi! No, no, no, no.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56.860 --> 00:59.700
Stupid git's left the engine
running. Get in!

00:59.700 --> 01:02.660
Hurry up, before that loser
notices his wheels are missing.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.820
Let's do it.

02:00.340 --> 02:04.060
Morning. I'm DI Lisa Brodie.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.660
Hi. Nikki Alexander.
This is Jack Hodgson.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.740
It's this way.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.180
We got a jumper?

02:24.180 --> 02:25.420
Possible.

02:25.420 --> 02:28.700
But there are drag marks inside,
which I'd like you to look at.

02:28.700 --> 02:31.300
The deceased carries no ID,

02:31.300 --> 02:34.420
but a young couple were
in the building at the time.

02:34.420 --> 02:38.940
They heard the car arrive,
someone go up the steps,

02:38.940 --> 02:42.180
saw the engine on, decided to
go for a spin, when...

02:45.900 --> 02:48.180
He's got significant facial
injuries.

02:50.260 --> 02:52.580
But, because of
the position of the body,

02:52.580 --> 02:54.460
it's unlikely they were caused
by the fall.

02:54.460 --> 02:59.100
And the blood pooling around the
body is unusually small.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.500
No glass on the ground,
so it would appear...

03:02.500 --> 03:05.140
..the window was not
smashed here.

03:08.620 --> 03:10.940
Nice shoe print
on the back of the car.

03:29.220 --> 03:31.460
Fingernail in the boot.

03:35.260 --> 03:37.100
Cinderella?

03:40.020 --> 03:42.140
Looks like a match.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.260
Maybe not a jumper, then.

03:44.260 --> 03:45.860
Hm.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.700
Bruising on the knuckles
seem more consistent

04:04.700 --> 04:06.740
with a fistfight than the fall.

04:06.740 --> 04:08.940
Yeah, I agree.
I think he put up a fight.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.660
Against who?
Drag marks on the floor,

04:11.660 --> 04:14.500
stairs, balcony indicate
the presence of another person.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.980
There's also a potential match
between this shoe print

04:16.980 --> 04:19.020
and the shoe print on the balcony.

04:24.380 --> 04:27.220
They don't match
the deceased's shoes.

04:27.220 --> 04:28.540
Someone else was here.

04:34.060 --> 04:35.940
Petechial haemorrhages in his eyes.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.660
Facial bruises.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.460
Compound nasal fracture.

04:44.540 --> 04:48.420
What appears to be part of
a circular intradermal bruise

04:48.420 --> 04:51.340
above the left supraorbital ridge,

04:51.340 --> 04:54.060
approximately one centimetre across.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.380
Fractured mandible.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.940
What is it?

05:07.940 --> 05:09.860
Looks like a fine white dust.

05:19.220 --> 05:22.540
There are circular scars
on his left and right forearms.

05:22.540 --> 05:24.460
They look historic.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.140
Could be cigarette burns.

05:30.180 --> 05:31.860
Knuckles heavily bruised.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.140
Fractured fifth metacarpal
on the right hand.

05:39.140 --> 05:41.980
Missing fingernail
on the right index.

05:47.700 --> 05:50.620
There are clearly
injuries on his body

05:50.620 --> 05:53.580
which are consistent with
an assault or an altercation.

05:53.580 --> 05:56.860
Some are recent,
but others appear to be older.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.860
There's also some lividity

05:59.860 --> 06:03.220
on the anterior aspect
of the chest and abdomen.

06:04.220 --> 06:05.380
Can we turn him?

06:12.260 --> 06:15.420
There's lividity on the front
and back of his body.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.020
Dad.

06:20.020 --> 06:22.020
Jack. Cara, sorry I'm late.

06:24.420 --> 06:25.980
I'm...sorry.

06:25.980 --> 06:28.020
Yeah, thank you, Cara.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.660
Adam?

06:29.660 --> 06:30.980
He was a good guy.

06:35.580 --> 06:37.060
Dad!

06:37.060 --> 06:38.700
Oh, it's good to see you, son.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.500
Jack Hodgson. Brother.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.260
My saviour, as always.
Good to see you.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.980
All right?

06:50.220 --> 06:52.740
Thank you. Here.

06:53.860 --> 06:56.220
Let's see if I can do this. Er...

06:56.220 --> 07:00.140
Cara, great to see you.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.140
Just the basics. Erm...

07:05.140 --> 07:11.300
I'm hungry. Do you want
to go somewhere for a bite?

07:13.420 --> 07:15.300
Food! For food.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.700
Sorry, pal, straight home for you -
it's the rules of probation.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.460
What, I can't take my daughter

07:20.460 --> 07:22.620
out for a meal on my first day
as a free man?

07:22.620 --> 07:24.820
Ryan, I need to sign off
that you arrived

07:24.820 --> 07:26.460
at your place of residence.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.180
Then you sign off
after we've had a bite, OK?

07:30.300 --> 07:31.900
Look, come on.

07:35.500 --> 07:40.740
Jack, Ryan needs all our
patience and understanding.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.420
Yeah, of course.

07:51.060 --> 07:55.460
There's also some haemosiderin.
See the yellow?

07:55.460 --> 07:57.300
These are from older injuries.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.460
How much older?

07:59.460 --> 08:00.580
At least 18 hours.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.420
He's been around the block.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.060
Cause of death could have been

08:04.060 --> 08:05.980
from traumatic
brain haemorrhage.

08:05.980 --> 08:08.180
Was the brain haemorrhage
caused by the fall

08:08.180 --> 08:09.380
or did it occur before?

08:09.380 --> 08:10.940
Well, he didn't die in the fall.

08:10.940 --> 08:12.180
He landed on his back...

08:13.460 --> 08:16.500
..so the lividity
should all have been there.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.580
But we found some lividity
on the front as well,

08:19.580 --> 08:21.220
so he died in a different position

08:21.220 --> 08:23.140
and then the body was moved after
death.

08:23.140 --> 08:26.620
Possibly transported face-down
in the boot of the car.

08:26.620 --> 08:28.740
Prints or trace samples
in the car?

08:28.740 --> 08:31.060
Plenty of prints. They all
belong to the owner of the car,

08:31.060 --> 08:33.460
who reported it stolen, and the
two kids who found the body.

08:33.460 --> 08:36.140
So someone steals a car,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.620
drives to an abandoned building,

08:38.620 --> 08:41.380
drags the body up the stairs
and throws it off the roof,

08:41.380 --> 08:44.820
where, by accident,
it lands on the roof of a car

08:44.820 --> 08:46.980
being nicked
for the second time that night.

08:46.980 --> 08:50.300
Yeah! What about the two kids?
They see anything?

08:50.300 --> 08:52.180
We talked to them at the station.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.940
They didn't see anyone.

08:53.940 --> 08:57.300
Looking at the historic
bruising, though -

08:57.300 --> 09:00.580
broken nose, raw knuckles -

09:00.580 --> 09:03.100
could be a boxer? At least
a bit of a street fighter.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.860
I agree. The fracture of
the little-finger metacarpal

09:05.860 --> 09:08.780
is called a boxer's fracture.
That's useful.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.020
Thank you, both.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.020
"Da Tang Noodle House."

10:02.220 --> 10:03.540
Gotcha.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.540
Jack?

10:36.420 --> 10:38.020
That kid's got a mighty left hook.

10:38.020 --> 10:39.620
Take a look at this.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.700
Looks like our man.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.620
Erm, can I help you?

10:50.580 --> 10:51.980
Kieran.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.780
Kieran Johnson.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.620
Why, what's happened to him?
Is he in trouble?

10:55.620 --> 10:57.460
When was he last at the gym?

10:57.460 --> 10:58.940
Last night.

10:58.940 --> 11:02.340
Was he his normal self?
Any disagreements with anyone?

11:02.340 --> 11:03.740
No. No.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.260
What's happened to him?

11:05.260 --> 11:07.180
You're THE Michelle Lafferty?

11:08.420 --> 11:11.340
Pioneer of UK female boxing?

11:11.340 --> 11:13.340
Are you a sports historian?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.940
Nah! I dabble a bit in MMA.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.860
You've got some real talent here.

11:17.860 --> 11:20.700
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
Ben Coogan out there, yeah?

11:20.700 --> 11:22.380
Yeah, he's good.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.700
But this gym isn't just about
finding talent, you know?

11:24.700 --> 11:26.780
It's about helping
young people off the street,

11:26.780 --> 11:29.140
giving them purpose, self-respect.

11:29.140 --> 11:30.980
"Jab, don't stab."

11:30.980 --> 11:33.020
Yeah, exactly.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.900
So, what's happened to Kieran?

11:35.900 --> 11:39.660
Until we've had a chance to speak to
Kieran Johnson's family,

11:39.660 --> 11:43.100
I can't... Let me tell you
about Kieran's family.

11:43.100 --> 11:48.100
His father was a drug dealer
who lost his head, literally.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.220
His good ol' mum
was a religious nut,

11:50.220 --> 11:51.940
but got her kicks
from branding Kieran

11:51.940 --> 11:55.060
with burning cigarettes. And
as for his worthless brother,

11:55.060 --> 11:57.660
all he ever does
is sponge off him. So...

11:57.660 --> 12:00.220
..when he came here,
he had nobody.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.380
We're his family.

12:04.060 --> 12:09.700
We've found the body of a young male
who we believe to be Kieran Johnson.

12:44.980 --> 12:47.980
Yeah, we did see Kieran here
last night,

12:47.980 --> 12:51.740
doing some training.
But I didn't speak with him.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.660
Did you, Ben?

12:53.660 --> 12:55.180
OK.

12:55.180 --> 12:57.980
Thanks. And your names?

12:57.980 --> 12:59.940
I'm Lee Coogan.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.580
This is my brother - Ben.

13:02.580 --> 13:03.940
Great.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.220
In-house CCTV?

13:10.220 --> 13:13.820
No. But, according to witnesses,
Kieran left the gym around 8pm.

13:13.820 --> 13:18.300
Right. His wife and brother are next
of kin. Chin up, bro.

13:18.300 --> 13:21.820
You go get changed,
then we'll grab some pints.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.860
All right, come on.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.180
Come on, Daddy.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.020
Hm? Come on, Daddy.

13:53.540 --> 13:55.460
Jesus!

14:07.060 --> 14:08.460
Jack?

14:09.980 --> 14:12.340
Look, I've been in a dark place.

14:13.380 --> 14:17.220
But... But thanks to
you and Cara,

14:17.220 --> 14:19.980
I...I have a life now.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.060
I'm glad.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.100
Ben?

15:28.140 --> 15:30.740
You OK?

15:32.980 --> 15:34.860
Bro.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.940
I know you're feeling low,

15:40.940 --> 15:42.900
but it wasn't any...

15:47.100 --> 15:48.660
All the shit we've been through -

15:48.660 --> 15:53.300
social workers, foster parents,
debt collectors...

15:54.580 --> 15:56.540
..none of them
ever ground us down.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.620
Why? Because together...

16:02.620 --> 16:04.260
..we're unbreakable.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.020
Come on.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.180
Now...

16:24.620 --> 16:27.020
..let's go get some dinner
before I collapse with hunger.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.380
Noah Johnson?

16:46.500 --> 16:47.980
Yeah?

16:47.980 --> 16:51.940
I'm DI Brodie. This is Jack Hodgson,
forensic scientist.

16:51.940 --> 16:55.820
I tried to reach you yesterday,
but you were not at home and...

16:55.820 --> 16:58.140
..not picking up.
Yeah, I do shift work.

16:58.140 --> 17:00.540
I'm sorry to tell you
that your brother was...

17:00.540 --> 17:02.220
Kieran's dead.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.580
I know. Teresa,
his wife, told me.

17:05.980 --> 17:08.020
Do you mind if we have a look
around your flat?

17:08.020 --> 17:09.420
Sorry, I'm late for work.

17:09.420 --> 17:12.860
When was the last time you spoke
with your brother, Mr Johnson?

17:12.860 --> 17:16.060
Honestly, I can't remember. I can
check my call list, if you like.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.940
Do you know where he might
have been two nights ago?

17:20.020 --> 17:22.700
How was your relationship
with Kieran? Yeah, fine.

17:23.820 --> 17:27.220
You've spent some time in prison
for burglary, car theft...

17:27.220 --> 17:29.100
What's that got to do
with anything?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.900
Yeah, I did.
Now, if that's all...

17:41.980 --> 17:44.380
For someone
who's just lost his brother,

17:44.380 --> 17:46.660
he doesn't seem
that bothered, does he?

17:46.660 --> 17:48.860
When did you last see
your husband?

17:48.860 --> 17:52.020
Er, Kieran went down
to Lafferty's Boxing Gym

17:52.020 --> 17:53.700
night before last,

17:53.700 --> 17:55.860
like he always does.

17:55.860 --> 17:58.020
He said not to stay up.

17:58.020 --> 17:59.260
He never came home.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.700
He didn't ring or...or text?

18:06.340 --> 18:09.620
Did he have a computer,
laptop, tablet,

18:09.620 --> 18:11.580
anything like that?

18:11.580 --> 18:13.100
No. I...

18:14.100 --> 18:15.740
Excuse me for a minute.

18:17.940 --> 18:20.540
Anything?
Signs of a possible struggle,

18:20.540 --> 18:22.780
but no way to tell
when it happened.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.460
They're here now.

18:30.940 --> 18:33.100
What if they find something?

18:33.100 --> 18:34.820
I don't know.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.180
All right.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.260
I will.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.940
I will.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.460
That's a lot of bears.

19:00.460 --> 19:01.540
Mm-hm.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.980
He bought her a new teddy
every week.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.980
Kieran was close
to his daughter?

19:08.980 --> 19:12.940
Kieran? He took
everything personally.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.740
But around Emily he was...

19:16.740 --> 19:19.220
..understanding, patient.

19:19.220 --> 19:23.140
We've been trying for
another baby for a while.

19:23.140 --> 19:26.740
Do you know where he might have gone
after boxing practise at the gym?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.620
Did your husband
have any enemies?

19:31.700 --> 19:33.340
The whole world was his enemy.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.900
Who were Kieran's friends?

19:37.900 --> 19:39.940
Kieran didn't do friends.

19:39.940 --> 19:42.460
The guys at the gym
were just competition.

19:43.580 --> 19:45.660
He only had respect for Michelle.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.180
She trained him.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.660
She was like a mother to him.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.020
Honestly, I think he loved her
more than me.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.060
I haven't told Emily yet.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.460
I mean, how...?

20:05.460 --> 20:07.460
How do you do that?

20:17.100 --> 20:18.860
Excuse me.

20:21.540 --> 20:23.780
I found a used
condom in the bathroom.

20:23.780 --> 20:25.860
OK, thanks.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.220
Mrs Johnson?

20:29.220 --> 20:32.900
You said you and Kieran
were trying for another baby.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.700
Yeah. Then can you explain

20:34.700 --> 20:37.060
the presence of a used condom
in the bathroom?

20:40.100 --> 20:41.460
One, two. Nice.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.140
One, two. Keep those hands up.

20:44.140 --> 20:45.500
Good. Jab.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.780
Good. Jab!

20:46.780 --> 20:49.500
Nice, bro.
All right? Nice.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.660
One, two. One, two, three.

20:51.660 --> 20:54.100
Boom! There we go.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.260
Good work, bro.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.260
I hate to ask this, but...

21:13.260 --> 21:15.620
..Miss Lloyd's after me again.

21:15.620 --> 21:19.540
It'll be the last one, I promise.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.340
You promise?! Because six months
ago

21:21.340 --> 21:22.980
you said it was only going to
be one fight!

21:22.980 --> 21:25.100
I know. But, look...

21:26.420 --> 21:30.940
..I'm laying everything we have on
this one, OK? You win, and I'll have

21:30.940 --> 21:33.460
cleared my debt with
Miss Lloyd, plus we'll have

21:33.460 --> 21:36.180
plenty left for us!
What if it happens again?

21:36.180 --> 21:38.020
It won't. You don't know that!

21:38.020 --> 21:39.580
OK!

21:39.580 --> 21:41.300
Message received.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.300
Look...

21:48.340 --> 21:49.780
..just think about it.

22:03.820 --> 22:04.820
Ben?

22:06.260 --> 22:07.340
Quick word?

22:10.180 --> 22:11.780
You can't take any more.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.820
You need to pull out, now.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.900
She'll come after him...

22:20.900 --> 22:22.620
..after me.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.100
Listen, if you don't do it now,

22:25.100 --> 22:26.900
you'll never get out.

22:31.900 --> 22:33.220
Listen...

22:34.820 --> 22:36.980
...I know what you've been through.

22:38.020 --> 22:42.420
Yeah? I'll be beside you
every step of the way.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.620
Oh...

22:52.620 --> 22:55.540
Oh, it's all right, honey.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.140
It's all right.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.900
Found this on a protein-bar wrapper

23:04.900 --> 23:06.580
in Kieran Johnson's locker at the
gym.

23:07.980 --> 23:09.980
"Maddington"?

23:09.980 --> 23:11.900
A place name? Person?

23:11.900 --> 23:13.780
We're looking into it.

23:13.780 --> 23:15.820
Seminal fluid in the used condom

23:15.820 --> 23:19.340
tests positive for Kieran's brother,
Noah.

23:19.340 --> 23:21.460
He's on the police database.

23:21.460 --> 23:24.460
Noah was having sex
with his brother's wife?

23:24.460 --> 23:26.300
Erm...

23:26.300 --> 23:27.900
It looks that way. Mm-hm. Yeah.

23:29.020 --> 23:34.100
A look at Kieran's bank account
was instructive.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.140
He's been making cash deposits

23:36.140 --> 23:38.460
of five grand into his account
every two weeks.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.780
The day before his death,

23:39.780 --> 23:41.180
he had 20 grand in there.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.700
However, the day after,
he had all of a tenner.

23:43.700 --> 23:45.660
Hm! The rest had all been

23:45.660 --> 23:48.940
transferred into
Teresa Johnson's account.

23:48.940 --> 23:51.420
Are we any closer to tracing
the site of Kieran's death

23:51.420 --> 23:53.700
before the fall?
Ah. I've contacted

23:53.700 --> 23:56.860
an archaeology colleague and he's
sending over someone to assist.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.060
Thanks.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.460
Hi.

24:19.460 --> 24:23.420
Hi. I'm Simone Tyler.
Professor Rowan sent me.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.660
Ah, of course. Hi.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.580
I'm Nikki Alexander. Come in.
Hi. Thanks.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.700
And this is...Jack.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.580
Simone Tyler. Hello.

24:32.580 --> 24:33.940
Hello.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.460
Oh. Oh...

24:35.460 --> 24:37.220
I'm so sorry!

24:37.220 --> 24:39.420
It's fine. Er...

24:39.420 --> 24:41.300
Happens here all the time.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.780
I've got a napkin.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.140
Lucky I didn't get the large latte.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.860
And...there goes my lunch.

24:56.340 --> 25:00.340
Come on, Simone, we'll get you
set up over here

25:00.340 --> 25:03.140
while Jack cleans up. Sorry.

25:06.020 --> 25:08.220
Jack will fill you in
on the case later

25:08.220 --> 25:11.620
and provide you with the
deceased's clothes and shoes,

25:11.620 --> 25:15.820
and I will get the body ready
for you to examine in detail.

25:15.820 --> 25:18.540
And then we can have a briefing.

25:18.540 --> 25:21.780
Dr Alexander, I-I'm not sure I'm the
right person for the job.

25:21.780 --> 25:24.420
Really? Why?
I'm not used to dead bodies.

25:24.420 --> 25:26.460
I'm more into reconstructing
ancient habitats

25:26.460 --> 25:28.460
from environmental traces.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.780
Well, that's exactly what
we want you to do here -

25:31.780 --> 25:34.620
reconstruct the environment
last visited by Kieran Johnson.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.020
I'm just a research fellow.

25:38.060 --> 25:39.660
Well, why don't we give it a go?

25:39.660 --> 25:42.780
Any problems, I'll be sitting
right over there.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.340
Noah and I, we...

25:57.580 --> 26:00.220
..we were going to run away
together...

26:00.220 --> 26:02.020
..take Emily with us.

26:02.020 --> 26:05.620
Can you explain why,
on the day of Kieran's death,

26:05.620 --> 26:10.780
the sum of £19,990 was transferred

26:10.780 --> 26:14.020
from Kieran's account
to Teresa Johnson's?

26:17.460 --> 26:19.340
How should I know?

26:19.340 --> 26:21.220
Kieran was....

26:22.300 --> 26:24.820
He'd become unbearable,

26:24.820 --> 26:28.540
so...obsessed with the boxing,

26:28.540 --> 26:31.220
with...making it,

26:31.220 --> 26:37.780
so angry at everything and
anything that stood in his way.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.420
Sometimes that included me.

26:40.420 --> 26:43.380
Traces of your seminal fluid

26:43.380 --> 26:47.460
were found in a condom in the
bathroom of your brother's house.

26:47.460 --> 26:51.620
I came here voluntarily to help
clear up Kieran's death...

26:51.620 --> 26:53.980
..not to be insulted.

26:53.980 --> 26:57.140
Noah hated the way
Kieran treated me.

26:57.140 --> 27:00.900
Noah made all these promises

27:00.900 --> 27:03.740
about a new life, but...

27:03.740 --> 27:07.780
..he couldn't go through with them.

27:07.780 --> 27:12.100
Look, Noah, whether you had an
affair with Teresa Johnson or not

27:12.100 --> 27:14.020
is...is your business.

27:14.020 --> 27:16.300
But what I need to know is...

27:16.300 --> 27:19.140
..did Kieran find out about it?

27:19.140 --> 27:21.900
Were you at Kieran's house
the night he died?

27:23.220 --> 27:25.020
My brother was always
there for me.

27:26.060 --> 27:27.780
When I got out of prison, he got me
a job.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.980
He never stopped believing in me.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.220
I did not kill him.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.100
I never said you did.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.820
Apart from a few blood droplets
on the T-shirt

27:40.820 --> 27:44.100
that belonged to Kieran,
I found nothing usable

27:44.100 --> 27:46.140
on any of the clothes.

27:46.140 --> 27:49.700
Well, luckily,
particulates are my speciality.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.700
Really? Mm-hm.

27:51.700 --> 27:55.300
And it's a good thing
I brought this guy, then.

27:56.820 --> 28:00.260
Oh, good Lord. What is this?
This...

28:00.260 --> 28:01.860
..is my friend.

28:03.620 --> 28:06.140
Ah, you brought your own!

28:07.700 --> 28:10.100
All right.

28:14.220 --> 28:18.780
OK, mister, time...to suck it up.

28:54.140 --> 28:55.980
Let's see what we've got, then.

29:00.580 --> 29:01.860
What is it?

29:03.340 --> 29:05.340
Hay pollen.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.940
Hay pollen.

29:47.060 --> 29:50.820
Hi. Er, excuse me, erm,
I think I've got something.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.340
What is it?

29:55.100 --> 29:56.500
Diatomaceous earth -

29:56.500 --> 29:59.180
used in things like worming
products and animal feed.

29:59.180 --> 30:01.740
Hay particles and animal feed.
What do you think?

30:01.740 --> 30:03.180
Could be from a farm.

30:03.180 --> 30:05.260
Could be a place to start.

30:05.260 --> 30:06.860
Examining the body might help you

30:06.860 --> 30:08.540
pin down a last location.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.140
Erm...

30:10.140 --> 30:11.540
Yes.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.300
It's late, and I haven't
prepared the body,

30:14.300 --> 30:15.940
so tomorrow morning's fine.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.740
Great.

30:18.740 --> 30:19.940
See you in the morning.

30:19.940 --> 30:20.980
OK.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.940
Goodnight. Goodnight.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.860
She's good.

30:26.860 --> 30:29.140
Much better than she thinks she is.

30:44.820 --> 30:47.620
Where were you? You're
supposed to be in by eight.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.300
Meeting old mates.

30:51.300 --> 30:54.700
Ryan, the rules of probation...

30:54.700 --> 30:58.020
State that I need to
inform you of where I'm going.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.540
Won't happen again.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.060
What do you have there?

31:07.620 --> 31:09.820
A bottle of Irish single malt.

31:10.820 --> 31:14.140
I intend to savour every drop.

31:14.140 --> 31:17.900
What's going on here, Ryan?
Just the sweet taste of freedom.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.700
That's the problem right there...

31:21.620 --> 31:23.660
..never a straight answer.

31:50.260 --> 31:52.220
Gran?

31:53.220 --> 31:55.140
Let's go out for a drink tonight.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.260
Shouldn't you keep
a clear head, Simi?

31:57.260 --> 31:59.260
You just started a new job!

31:59.260 --> 32:01.060
Oh, I'll be fine.

32:02.140 --> 32:05.060
Remember when you
guest lectured at Glasgow Uni?

32:05.060 --> 32:07.980
Mm? You left after three weeks.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.020
Yeah, it was cold up there!

32:10.020 --> 32:14.140
Or that time when you refused
to join the research group

32:14.140 --> 32:16.660
with that famous
professor of ecology.

32:16.660 --> 32:19.900
Yeah, to be the token black
woman on an all-male group?

32:19.900 --> 32:21.940
No, thanks.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.340
Don't let another opportunity
pass you.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.300
Tina Turner night again, is it?

32:30.260 --> 32:31.540
I'm in.

32:49.660 --> 32:52.540
You have one new message.

32:52.540 --> 32:55.420
Hi, Dr Alexander.
Simone Tyler here.

32:55.420 --> 32:58.180
Just wanted to let you know I won't
be continuing on the case.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.860
Professor Rowan will send
someone to replace me, though.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.820
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.700
Oh, come on!

33:15.180 --> 33:16.940
Do you want some help?

33:20.660 --> 33:22.420
Dr Alexander.

33:23.780 --> 33:24.860
Thank you.

33:28.140 --> 33:31.140
When I look at you,
you know what I see?

33:31.140 --> 33:32.860
Ha. Last night's hangover?

33:32.860 --> 33:36.380
I see someone who has the
confidence to doubt herself.

33:36.380 --> 33:39.980
I think you might need to get
your eyes tested, Doctor.

33:39.980 --> 33:42.260
You know, my first day
at the Lyell, I thought

33:42.260 --> 33:44.260
I had the answer to everything.

33:44.260 --> 33:45.660
First lesson I learned -

33:45.660 --> 33:48.100
overconfidence can lead to tunnel
vision,

33:48.100 --> 33:49.860
any scientist's worst enemy.

33:49.860 --> 33:52.260
Well, I've got nothing
to worry about, then!

33:52.260 --> 33:55.300
I see someone who is
methodical, observant,

33:55.300 --> 33:58.420
and you have a set of skills
that we need for this case.

33:58.420 --> 34:01.300
Hm. In other words,

34:01.300 --> 34:03.660
you don't have time
to find anyone else.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.060
Well, there's that, too.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.180
Emily, this is Simone.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.580
Hey, Emily.

34:15.300 --> 34:18.300
Hot chocolate.
Loads of marshmallows.

34:18.300 --> 34:21.820
I'll only be a minute, sweetie.
Will you be OK?

34:23.420 --> 34:25.300
- Mummy!
- It's OK.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.780
That's a lot of teddies you've got
there.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.540
Who's your favourite?

34:47.060 --> 34:49.060
Ready?

35:04.900 --> 35:07.860
Ah-ha! I bet he's got
a cool name.

35:07.860 --> 35:10.860
Yes. His name's Mr Puddlington.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.260
Puddlington? Wow!

35:13.260 --> 35:15.140
That is a cool name.

35:15.140 --> 35:18.060
It's because he likes to
jump in puddles.

35:18.060 --> 35:19.380
Ah.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.460
And what are his mates called?

35:23.980 --> 35:27.500
This is Miss Laughington
because she loves to laugh.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.300
And this is Mr Snugglington,
because he loves snuggles.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.420
Do you also have a teddy
called Maddington?

35:33.420 --> 35:36.420
It's Mr Maddington
cos he's always mad.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.340
He's at home.

35:38.340 --> 35:39.740
There you are!

35:41.500 --> 35:43.700
Will you hurt Mr Maddington?

35:45.860 --> 35:47.780
I'm just going to take him
for a quick checkup.

35:47.780 --> 35:49.540
He'll be back with you
before you know it -

35:49.540 --> 35:50.820
that's a promise.

35:53.140 --> 35:54.860
See what I've got?

35:54.860 --> 35:57.220
Don't mind us.

35:57.220 --> 36:00.660
Lisa, this is the forensic
ecologist who's assisting us,

36:00.660 --> 36:03.180
Simone Tyler.
Simone, this is DI Lisa Brodie.

36:07.580 --> 36:10.140
Do you two know each other
from before?

36:10.140 --> 36:12.180
In a manner of speaking.

36:13.220 --> 36:14.620
Come and look at this.

36:20.620 --> 36:21.940
Hm!

36:24.420 --> 36:26.500
Careful! What?

36:26.500 --> 36:29.820
Or you'll have one very upset
little girl to answer to.

36:29.820 --> 36:31.300
Here.

36:31.300 --> 36:33.620
You're better with
a scalpel, aren't you?

36:40.820 --> 36:43.060
This won't hurt a bit.

36:49.220 --> 36:50.580
Let's see what's on it.

36:53.340 --> 36:54.900
Thank you.

37:02.660 --> 37:06.260
I'm offering Ben
the opportunity that most

37:06.260 --> 37:08.940
young boxers would kill for!

37:08.940 --> 37:10.620
It's not the right time.

37:11.780 --> 37:15.900
Listen, if Ben is lacking
a little bit of, you know,

37:15.900 --> 37:17.420
self-belief, then there are

37:17.420 --> 37:19.180
ways of stacking the odds
in his favour.

37:19.180 --> 37:21.900
Steroids and enhancers?

37:21.900 --> 37:23.580
Ben'll never go for that!

37:23.580 --> 37:26.700
He doesn't have to know
anything about it.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.460
Lee Coogan will tell us who that is.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.620
Hang on a sec.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.860
Our mystery man is offering Ben a
career,

37:31.860 --> 37:34.900
so most likely he's
a boxing promoter of some sort.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.460
Now...

37:36.460 --> 37:38.940
He's not one of
the bigger promoters,

37:38.940 --> 37:40.500
or else I'd have heard of him.

37:41.500 --> 37:42.820
Mid to low level is my guess.

37:44.140 --> 37:46.340
London-based, probably.

37:46.340 --> 37:48.620
There. Glenn Scowcroft,

37:48.620 --> 37:52.340
owner of GTS Promotions since 2000.

37:53.580 --> 37:55.180
Clients include....

37:55.180 --> 37:56.740
Ah.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.980
No Kieran Johnson here.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.300
If that footage was posted online,

38:01.300 --> 38:04.340
Scowcroft would be investigated
by the UK Boxing Council.

38:04.340 --> 38:06.380
It'd do severe damage to his career.

38:06.380 --> 38:09.780
The 5K biweekly cash payments into
Kieran Johnson's account...

38:09.780 --> 38:13.420
Kieran could have been blackmailing
Scowcroft. Oh, good work, Jack.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.900
Really good work. Ah, you know.

38:15.900 --> 38:18.540
In my spare time,
I, er, I like to juggle.

38:18.540 --> 38:21.780
I do card tricks
and I mix a mean margarita,

38:21.780 --> 38:23.220
if you're interested.

38:23.220 --> 38:25.580
Somehow, I don't think I'm your

38:23.220 --> 38:25.580
type.

38:29.940 --> 38:33.260
And what made you
choose this job?

38:33.260 --> 38:36.460
I was always fascinated
by the stories that bodies can tell.

38:36.460 --> 38:40.220
Yeah! See, when I look at a
habitat, each fragment of soil,

38:40.220 --> 38:42.980
each pollen grain, each insect

38:42.980 --> 38:46.180
tells me a story - where it
came from, how it got there.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.580
Exactly. It's the same with bodies

38:48.580 --> 38:51.700
and I wanted to put that knowledge
into the service of solving crime.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.780
Why crime?

38:54.980 --> 38:56.980
Because I think it's important to
know

38:56.980 --> 38:59.180
the end of the story of someone's
life,

38:59.180 --> 39:01.220
what actually happened to them,

39:01.220 --> 39:04.940
and that can make all the difference
to those who are still living.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.940
It's a deepfake.
It doesn't prove a thing.

39:12.380 --> 39:14.140
Was Kieran blackmailing you?

39:15.620 --> 39:17.980
Were you paying him 5K every two
weeks?

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
Yeah, I loaned him money regularly.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.340
I felt sorry for him.

39:26.340 --> 39:27.860
Why?

39:30.140 --> 39:32.180
Kieran had potential
when he was younger,

39:32.180 --> 39:35.020
so I signed him on
for a bit, briefly.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.660
But, to make it in the big time,
you've got to have

39:37.660 --> 39:39.860
patience and talent as well.

39:39.860 --> 39:41.620
So you dropped him? Yeah.

39:42.660 --> 39:44.540
How did that make Kieran feel?

39:44.540 --> 39:48.740
I suppose he was worried
about supporting his family,

39:48.740 --> 39:51.420
so I decided to help him out.

39:51.420 --> 39:53.780
When did you see Kieran last?

39:54.820 --> 39:57.180
Three days ago.

39:57.180 --> 39:59.420
Said he was going to have it
out with Ben once and for all.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.940
Ben Coogan? Yeah.

40:01.940 --> 40:04.940
I've wanted to sign Ben
for some time.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.340
He's a real talent.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.140
And Kieran hated him for it,

40:08.140 --> 40:11.540
said he was overrated and he was
going to prove it to me.

40:11.540 --> 40:13.260
What do you think he meant by that?

40:13.260 --> 40:16.220
Maybe they were going to
fight it out.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.860
And did they?

40:23.060 --> 40:24.580
Why don't you ask Ben?

41:19.820 --> 41:21.260
How did you get here?

41:23.620 --> 41:24.980
No! What do you mean,

41:24.980 --> 41:26.300
you're not going to fight?!

41:26.300 --> 41:28.060
I need you to do one thing!

41:28.060 --> 41:30.340
And because of her
you're going to snake me?!

41:30.340 --> 41:33.740
Have you lost your whole mind?! Do
you realise what you've done to me?!

41:45.020 --> 41:47.900
Ben, can I have a word?

41:48.900 --> 41:50.220
Alone.

41:50.220 --> 41:52.060
I've no secrets from her.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.900
Sure.

41:54.900 --> 41:56.140
OK.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.660
After you finished training
on Sunday evening,

42:06.660 --> 42:08.260
where did you go?

42:09.940 --> 42:13.060
Uh... Uh, home,
then straight to bed.

42:15.060 --> 42:18.900
Glenn Scowcroft claims that Kieran
bore a grudge against you.

42:18.900 --> 42:22.460
No, Kieran was...Kieran
was just competitive.

42:22.460 --> 42:26.820
Did Kieran want to fight it out
with you, prove who was better?

42:30.860 --> 42:33.700
Did that fight take place
the night he died?

42:37.660 --> 42:40.980
Ben was here with me, training till
late, the night Kieran died.

42:40.980 --> 42:43.460
You're prepared to sign
a sworn statement

42:43.460 --> 42:45.020
to that effect? Of course.

42:48.660 --> 42:50.060
Fine.

42:52.620 --> 42:54.260
Come on.

42:57.540 --> 43:02.060
I think time of death was most
likely between 11pm and 3am.

43:03.220 --> 43:06.180
Glenn Scowcroft was
entertaining that night.

43:06.180 --> 43:09.540
The last guest left his house
at around...

43:09.540 --> 43:13.220
..1am, which is when
his phone was turned off.

43:13.220 --> 43:16.660
That leaves two hours
without an alibi.

43:16.660 --> 43:18.500
Toxicology back?

43:18.500 --> 43:22.700
Er, yes. We found traces of
temazepam in Kieran's body.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.140
Sleeping tablet?

43:24.140 --> 43:25.500
Correct. He would have been

43:25.500 --> 43:27.700
drowsy and fatigued at the time of
his death.

43:27.700 --> 43:31.300
Any connection to the traces of fine
white dust found on Kieran's face?

43:31.300 --> 43:32.660
No, that's plaster of Paris.

43:32.660 --> 43:34.420
Right...

43:34.420 --> 43:36.580
Well, in order to
get one over an opponent,

43:36.580 --> 43:39.900
boxers have been known to sprinkle a
layer of plaster dust

43:39.900 --> 43:41.780
over the bandages
that cover their fists.

43:41.780 --> 43:43.500
As the boxer begins to sweat,

43:43.500 --> 43:45.900
the moisture causes the plaster
to harden,

43:45.900 --> 43:47.980
magnifying the impact of the blows.

43:47.980 --> 43:50.300
It also indicates
that whoever hit Kieran

43:50.300 --> 43:52.580
wasn't wearing boxing gloves,
just wraps.

43:52.580 --> 43:55.100
Kieran had a grudge against
Ben Coogan,

43:55.100 --> 43:57.980
challenged him to a fight.

43:57.980 --> 44:00.060
It's possible they had a fight

44:00.060 --> 44:02.460
and Ben hit him too hard.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.700
We need evidence.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.700
Simone, what have you got?
Er...

44:06.700 --> 44:09.260
..yes, so, first of all,

44:09.260 --> 44:12.180
I found traces of hay particles

44:12.180 --> 44:15.420
on Kieran Johnson's trousers.

44:15.420 --> 44:18.300
Oh! Oh, sorry! Uh... On his...

44:18.300 --> 44:21.060
..trouser legs and under the soles
of...

44:22.900 --> 44:26.140
..the soles of his, er, shoes.

44:26.140 --> 44:29.580
Erm, hay isn't particularly
uncommon,

44:29.580 --> 44:31.340
but, along with the diatomaceous
earth,

44:31.340 --> 44:33.740
it suggests he was on a farm.

44:33.740 --> 44:37.980
We also examined Kieran's lungs
and inside were

44:37.980 --> 44:42.860
a number of fibres
of a cotton-synthetic mixture.

44:43.860 --> 44:46.780
OK. Meaning?

44:48.340 --> 44:51.020
When I examined Kieran, I found

44:51.020 --> 44:54.860
petechial haemorrhages,
which, although not absolutely

44:54.860 --> 44:58.100
diagnostic of it, are commonly
found in deaths from asphyxia.

44:58.100 --> 45:01.940
So, along with the fibres
in the lungs, is it possible

45:01.940 --> 45:05.140
that Kieran was suffocated
with a microfibre cloth?

45:05.140 --> 45:07.300
It looks that way.

45:07.300 --> 45:10.380
So Kieran wasn't killed by
a blow to the head.

45:12.140 --> 45:13.820
Good.

45:22.340 --> 45:24.980
Why didn't you tell me you'd
been assigned to a murder case?

45:24.980 --> 45:26.780
Hello to you, too!

45:29.540 --> 45:32.900
Oh, I didn't think
it was that important.

45:35.420 --> 45:37.980
We're living together for over a
year

45:37.980 --> 45:41.140
and you've still got your suitcase
in the corner, ready to go.

45:41.140 --> 45:45.380
You keep your own food in
a separate part of the fridge

45:45.380 --> 45:49.020
and every time you take
a shower you lock the door!

45:49.020 --> 45:51.860
You are so bloody secretive!

45:51.860 --> 45:54.180
You're the one who didn't want
Jack and Dr Alexander

45:54.180 --> 45:55.420
to know we were together.

45:55.420 --> 45:58.460
And now I'm obliged
to bring it up with the Super,

45:58.460 --> 46:02.260
because our relationship could be
seen to jeopardise this case!

46:03.340 --> 46:04.900
Oh, wow.

46:07.780 --> 46:10.020
Are you even serious
about coming with me?

46:11.980 --> 46:13.900
Of course I am.

46:13.900 --> 46:16.420
Then why haven't you applied for
your Australian work visa yet?

46:16.420 --> 46:17.860
I will!

46:22.940 --> 46:24.340
I will.

46:26.100 --> 46:31.020
Who else is going to
make you breakfast in bed?

46:32.220 --> 46:34.900
As long as it's not
your scrambled egg.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.620
Ryan?

47:28.100 --> 47:29.860
They don't call you Sherlock
for nothing.

47:29.860 --> 47:32.780
You bring this into my house?
Are you mad?!

47:32.780 --> 47:38.540
Look, the way things work inside is,
you do favours. This...

47:38.540 --> 47:40.460
This happens to be one.

47:40.460 --> 47:42.780
I can't keep covering for you, Ryan.

47:42.780 --> 47:46.460
And yet that's exactly
what I did for you. For God's sake!

47:46.460 --> 47:47.780
I need to deliver it.

47:47.780 --> 47:50.820
It'll be out of your house
by tomorrow evening.

47:50.820 --> 47:53.460
I just can't believe you!
The stupidity of it!

47:54.900 --> 47:56.300
Everything OK?

47:56.300 --> 47:58.700
Everything's fine, Dad.
All good, Dad.

48:01.260 --> 48:03.300
Come on, you go downstairs.

48:04.300 --> 48:05.940
Come on.

49:08.940 --> 49:09.980
Kovic!

49:11.100 --> 49:12.260
Yo!

49:13.260 --> 49:14.740
You look different.

49:15.820 --> 49:16.940
New haircut?

49:26.700 --> 49:28.060
Oh!

49:28.060 --> 49:30.020
Miss Lloyd!

49:30.020 --> 49:32.620
Just the person I wanted to see.

49:32.620 --> 49:35.460
Er, about tonight...

49:35.460 --> 49:38.820
Ben signed with promoter Glenn
Scowcroft

49:38.820 --> 49:42.700
and has a legit fight on this
evening.

49:42.700 --> 49:45.740
You've made some good money
betting on your brother,

49:45.740 --> 49:49.260
enough to pay me back
almost everything you owe me.

49:50.260 --> 49:53.140
Almost. He'll be....

49:55.220 --> 49:58.060
He'll be too knackered to
do two fights in one evening.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.260
Bets are already in,
we've got a full house.

50:01.820 --> 50:04.780
Either you get him
to show up tonight...

50:05.780 --> 50:07.300
..or we will.

50:07.300 --> 50:09.700
Kovic, show him how we do it.

50:16.340 --> 50:19.500
Thought you'd gone home. Mm-hm...

50:19.500 --> 50:21.740
Getting a bit crowded in there.

50:21.740 --> 50:23.460
Fancy a drink?

50:25.620 --> 50:26.980
Actually...

50:27.980 --> 50:29.500
..I've got a better idea.

50:33.380 --> 50:35.740
This is great. You can just
feel it, can't you? Huh?

50:35.740 --> 50:38.740
Feel what? Alarming levels
of testosterone? Yeah, that too.

50:44.820 --> 50:48.700
No, I mean the anticipation,
you know? The buzz!

50:48.700 --> 50:53.260
I feel something, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

50:53.260 --> 50:56.500
we have something special
for you tonight.

50:56.500 --> 51:01.700
In the red corner, a man who needs
no introduction,

51:01.700 --> 51:05.380
Grant "Let's Have It" Lomax!

51:07.300 --> 51:12.460
And in the blue corner, our special
guest for the night, a young man...

51:12.460 --> 51:14.820
He's not looking too happy.

51:14.820 --> 51:16.140
You wait till the bell rings.

51:16.140 --> 51:21.420
..a young man so fast you'll never
see him coming,

51:21.420 --> 51:26.620
Ben "The Tornado" Coogan!

51:42.700 --> 51:44.500
He's not going to last!

51:44.500 --> 51:46.860
He's just gauging
what his opponent's made of.

51:46.860 --> 51:50.260
Just wait. Just wait.
He'll come through.

52:02.020 --> 52:04.300
There's his brother Lee.

52:11.860 --> 52:12.940
Ooh...

52:21.460 --> 52:25.100
One, two, three,

52:25.100 --> 52:29.020
four, five,

52:29.020 --> 52:31.620
six, seven,

52:31.620 --> 52:34.780
eight, nine,

52:34.780 --> 52:36.300
ten.

52:45.100 --> 52:46.820
Here he is.

52:49.060 --> 52:50.500
He looks happy.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.500
Yep. They don't.

52:52.500 --> 52:55.700
Looks like they lost
a few bob on the match.

52:55.700 --> 52:57.220
Right.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.940
Shall we go home, then?

52:58.940 --> 53:00.980
Yeah, in a minute, yeah.

53:00.980 --> 53:02.380
What?

53:06.660 --> 53:08.220
We need to talk.

53:08.220 --> 53:10.580
No, Lee, come on!

53:10.580 --> 53:12.740
Lee... Lee!

53:12.740 --> 53:14.540
Lee!

53:18.780 --> 53:20.060
I don't like the look of that.

53:20.060 --> 53:21.620
No, Ben, leave it.

53:25.300 --> 53:27.300
Jack...

53:28.820 --> 53:30.500
Get away from him!

53:47.980 --> 53:50.820
What a fight, eh?

53:53.540 --> 53:55.500
Jack, stop it! Stop it!

54:03.540 --> 54:06.340
Who the hell were they?
Sore losers.

54:06.340 --> 54:07.580
Are you all right?

54:07.580 --> 54:09.380
Hey!

54:09.380 --> 54:11.620
Wait a second! Hey!

54:11.620 --> 54:13.860
Ben? Ben!

54:20.220 --> 54:21.740
I don't know
what you were thinking,

54:21.740 --> 54:23.260
wading into a fight like that.

54:23.260 --> 54:26.220
If someone punches me, I have
a tendency to punch them back.

54:26.220 --> 54:29.540
Punch back? You looked like
you were auditioning for Rocky.

54:34.060 --> 54:35.900
What's going on with you?

54:39.780 --> 54:41.020
Ryan.

54:43.420 --> 54:45.220
He brought a gun into the house.

54:48.540 --> 54:50.340
Did you inform his probation
officer?

54:55.460 --> 54:59.300
Look, I know you feel indebted to
Ryan

54:59.300 --> 55:02.540
for what he did for you years ago...

55:02.540 --> 55:05.060
..but at some point that debt is
paid.

55:05.060 --> 55:08.220
At what point, Nikki? At what point?

55:08.220 --> 55:10.100
You don't know what I've done.

55:13.940 --> 55:15.220
What?

55:15.220 --> 55:16.900
What is it? Keep still.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.260
What are you doing?

55:19.780 --> 55:20.860
Huh?

55:22.900 --> 55:23.900
Look.

55:25.020 --> 55:26.460
What does that remind you of?

55:28.580 --> 55:30.500
The bruise on Kieran Johnson's face.

55:38.700 --> 55:41.660
Dad? Sorry, meant to tell you
I was going to be late.

55:41.660 --> 55:43.460
Jack...

55:43.460 --> 55:44.740
Da, what's wrong?

55:45.740 --> 55:47.260
Dad!

56:02.100 --> 56:03.780
Let's go, Ben!

56:03.780 --> 56:05.340
You got this!

56:05.340 --> 56:07.460
Come on, keep moving!

56:09.380 --> 56:12.100
Good one! Go on!

56:12.100 --> 56:14.060
Move! Keep your hands up!

56:22.100 --> 56:24.540
Get up, Ben! Get up!

56:24.540 --> 56:26.780
Get up!

56:31.020 --> 56:32.580
Ben!

56:52.940 --> 56:54.060
Dad...

56:55.100 --> 56:57.460
Jack...? Dad... Don't try and move.

56:57.460 --> 56:59.420
We've got an ambulance coming.

57:00.460 --> 57:03.380
Ryan....he had a gun.

57:03.380 --> 57:05.940
I tried to take it off him, but...

57:10.820 --> 57:14.780
He took my money, my bank card.

57:16.860 --> 57:18.900
Did Ryan do this to you, Dad?

57:18.900 --> 57:20.660
Don't judge him, son.

57:22.100 --> 57:24.140
He didn't know what he was doing.

57:25.340 --> 57:26.780
Jack...

57:28.740 --> 57:31.420
It's OK. It's all right, Dad.
It's all right.

57:31.420 --> 57:34.260
Shh... It's OK. It's all right.

58:13.900 --> 58:17.620
He didn't mean to do it.
He didn't mean to.

58:17.620 --> 58:19.620
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

58:19.620 --> 58:21.300
I'm sorry...

58:23.300 --> 58:25.940
I'm sorry...
