'911. What's your emergency?'

00:23.356 --> 00:25.024
My son's been kidnapped.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.443
There was a guy in a...
...in a pickup truck.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.987
A white rusted out pickup truck
with a camper shell on the back.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.824
- 'What's your son's name, sir?'
- Benjamin. Benjamin Landry.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.535
Fuck! Fuck!

01:04.813 --> 01:08.150
What's going on?
What's going on? Where is he?

01:08.276 --> 01:10.194
Excuse me.
I'm Detective Berger.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.864
I was talking to your husband
about your son's kidnapping.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.824
Mrs Landry,
can you sit down and talk?

01:15.950 --> 01:18.494
Where's my son?
I want him back!

01:18.620 --> 01:22.706
- We're going to find him, OK?
- Oh, God!

01:22.832 --> 01:25.417
I just overheard two cops talking
about how unusual it is

01:25.543 --> 01:27.753
for a child to be abducted
in the parent's plain view.

01:27.879 --> 01:31.298
They said that the fact that the
perpetrator showed so little concern

01:31.424 --> 01:35.135
over whether he could be recognised
points away from kidnapping for ransom.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.348
- What does that mean?
- Means he's a psychopath.

01:40.892 --> 01:47.648
- Jesus.
- My baby.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.441
Mrs Landry, can I help you
with something?

01:49.567 --> 01:51.276
- I'm going to look for my son.
- Where?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.320
Out there. We're not going
to find him in here.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.446
- Please
- No.

01:54.572 --> 01:56.573
Elise. Honey, we've got
to let them do their jobs.

01:56.699 --> 01:57.699
- No
- OK?

01:57.826 --> 02:00.285
Baby, how can you just stand there?
We're not doing anything!

02:00.411 --> 02:03.789
We've been sitting here all day
while they're trying to do their jobs!

02:03.915 --> 02:07.626
- We're going to find him.
- No! Their job is to find my son!

02:07.752 --> 02:10.086
Their fucking job is to find my son!

02:10.213 --> 02:15.008

25 years to life

21:35.168 --> 21:39.171
Once I opened the fortified door,
I discovered Benjamin's body.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.632
He must have died
just moments before.

21:45.387 --> 21:49.265
After paramedics responded
to Benjamin,

21:49.391 --> 21:52.101
the investigation quickly
uncovered a mass grave

21:52.227 --> 21:54.937
located in the defendant's
backyard.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.147
Within the site,

21:56.273 --> 22:00.484
numerous body parts in various stages
of decomposition were found.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.361
Rutland County Forensics Team

22:02.487 --> 22:05.323
is still trying to determine
the amount of victims

22:05.449 --> 22:07.408
and their identities
through the skeletal remains

22:07.534 --> 22:10.077
exhumed
from the defendant's property.

22:10.203 --> 22:14.040
The task has been challenging
since no victims were intact

22:14.166 --> 22:16.292
and the bodies
were systematically mutilated.

22:17.586 --> 22:21.213
I wish he was dead.
Did you see the look on his face?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.175
I want him dead.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.385
Well, it's not our decision to make.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.015
Elise.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.852
Are you going to be all right?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.105
Do you want to talk to someone?

22:38.231 --> 22:40.441
I'm losing my mind now
because I want justice?

22:40.567 --> 22:41.984
No.

22:44.279 --> 22:46.614
I'm just worried about you.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.454
Has the jury reached a verdict?

22:55.374 --> 22:56.832
Yes we have, Your Honour.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.378
Would the defendant please rise
and face the jury?

23:04.841 --> 23:07.301
Would you please tell the court
your verdict?

23:07.427 --> 23:10.096
We the jury
find the defendant...

23:13.767 --> 23:19.021
Twenty-five years to life?
He could be out in ten years!

23:19.147 --> 23:21.982
It was the only way they could get him to
reveal the locations of the other bodies.

23:22.109 --> 23:25.403
- Oh, God.
- Their families needed that for closure.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.738
They put tremendous pressure
on the D.A.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.365
OK, come here.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.539
I want you to help me get a gun.

23:36.665 --> 23:40.000
- What?
- I want you to help me get a gun.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.671
Jesus Christ, Elise, you...
You can't talk like that.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.298
I mean, do you really
want to lower yourself to what he is?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.050
- Aren't we more evolved than that?
- Don't give me that crap.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.010
It's not crap!

23:51.721 --> 23:53.806
You don't want me
to be like him, Craig?

23:53.932 --> 23:56.392
Fuck off!
How could I ever be like him?

23:56.518 --> 23:59.895
Look, killing him
is not going to change anything.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.647
It's not going to bring Ben back.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.358
I want him dead.

24:04.484 --> 24:06.277
Craig, I don't want him eating.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.822
I don't want him exercising,
watching TV or fucking jerking off.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.991
- You're just angry.
- Craig, how do you do this?

24:12.117 --> 24:15.870
- Do what?
- Disconnect like this from reality?

24:16.746 --> 24:19.290
We failed our son.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.042
We failed him.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.378
It was our responsibility
to protect him.

24:24.504 --> 24:29.341
And we failed to do that
and he's dead.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.303
Now don't you feel
we need to do something?

24:32.429 --> 24:35.181
For the dignity of our child.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.022
Fuck.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.774
I left the bills on your desk.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.030
The electric bill is overdue.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.251
Bye, Craig.

26:59.951 --> 27:03.203
'Blow out the candles, buddy.'
'Make a wish, Benji.'

27:04.748 --> 27:07.166
'Flying' 'Hold on!'

27:07.292 --> 27:08.709
'Hi, Daddy.'

27:17.052 --> 27:21.055
'Every day we struggle,
knowing what our son went through.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.225
'Imagine being assaulted
by a 13 foot giant.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.896
'That's roughly the scale
of a child to a grown man.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.481
'A monster of a man...'

27:30.607 --> 27:32.191
'Shut the fuck up.'

27:32.317 --> 27:35.694
'...who subjects you
to the most repulsive depravities.

27:35.820 --> 27:39.615
'Imagine on top of that
you were someone...

27:39.741 --> 27:41.283
'...someone new to this world.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.453
'A child.'

27:46.748 --> 27:50.918
'Bug, we miss you. Here I am.'

27:52.462 --> 27:54.588
'Shut up.

27:55.965 --> 27:57.466
'What are you going to do, Daddy?'

28:10.605 --> 28:12.523
Killing him
is not punishment enough.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.381
I don't like this, Craig.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.924
Everyone knows you in there.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.468
Not everybody.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.325
Shit.

29:49.579 --> 29:52.080
What the hell
are you doing here, Craig?

29:52.207 --> 29:54.416
The Board
gave you six months, take it.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.628
Elise is a fucking wreck.
Everyday it just gets worse.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.673
- I needed to get out of the house.
- So why did you come here?

30:01.800 --> 30:05.803
You throw yourself into work,
hide in the back of an ambulance?

30:05.929 --> 30:07.763
She needs you.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.558
What happened was a tragedy
for her, for both of you.

30:13.186 --> 30:16.522
- You know you can call me, right?
- Yeah, I know.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.155
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.327
Thanks.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.830
Don't get yourself in trouble.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.107
What do you see?

31:00.233 --> 31:02.901
- It's him.
- Let me see.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.865
Bastard.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.325
- Let me see.
- No. Let's go, let's go.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.469
There they are.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.430
- Yeah, I see them.
- OK.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.708
- Craig, please keep a distance.
- I know!

31:59.834 --> 32:01.585
Can you please...

32:01.711 --> 32:04.129
We've got to stay calm,
both of us.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.882
Otherwise we're not going to be able
to pull this thing off.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.258
I'm sorry.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.900
They're not going to stop.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.573
Look.

32:39.290 --> 32:43.126
- How do you take it, black, cream?
- One cream, one sugar.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.928
- You ready?
- Yeah.

32:53.054 --> 32:57.724
- You have everything?
- Yeah... OK.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.352
OK...

33:01.688 --> 33:03.689
All right, go.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.316
- I'll see you in there.
- OK.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.883
There you go.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.721
- There you go, sir.
- Thanks a lot.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.848
You're welcome.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.560
Can I help you?

33:46.941 --> 33:48.692
Ma'am?

33:54.032 --> 33:57.200
- Do they have any brown sugar?
- Don't see any.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.842
Thanks.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.802
- Hey, where's my change?
- What change?

34:15.928 --> 34:18.847
I gave you 20 dollars
on pump five, where's my change?

34:18.973 --> 34:21.224
- I'll give you no change.
- Give me my money.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.310
I don't owe you any money.

34:23.436 --> 34:26.146
All right, maybe you're right,
sorry.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.522
Fucking mutt!

34:28.399 --> 34:29.900
- Did you do it?
- Done.

34:30.025 --> 34:32.569
It should kick in
in about a half an hour.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.464
- It's been 45 minutes.
- Yeah.

34:54.592 --> 34:58.512
- You sure this is going to work?
- Elise, please.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.890
Maybe they didn't drink
their coffee right away.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.771
They're speeding up.
I think it's working.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.482
They're looking for a place
to pull over.

35:10.608 --> 35:14.152
- Here?
- I guess we have no choice.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.623
All right, now!

35:38.594 --> 35:41.138
Buckle your fucking seatbelt,
asshole.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.099
Shit!

35:44.851 --> 35:46.685
Hey! Stop!

35:47.186 --> 35:48.937
Come on!

35:50.606 --> 35:51.606
Come on!

35:51.732 --> 35:53.108
Let's go.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.148
For Christ's sake, slow down.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.407
Oh, my...

37:00.468 --> 37:02.761
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.679
Oh, my God. Craig!

37:06.641 --> 37:08.308
Craig!

37:09.393 --> 37:11.228
God!

37:11.771 --> 37:13.897
Craig!

37:17.401 --> 37:19.819
Are you OK?

37:21.739 --> 37:23.573
Oh, God!

37:24.367 --> 37:26.618
Yeah, I think so.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.871
He's over there!

37:41.425 --> 37:44.177
- Oh, my God. Let me see.
- I'm OK.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.721
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.225
He may not have survived this.

37:57.149 --> 37:59.818
- He's alive.
- Thank God.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.758
Here we go.

38:31.434 --> 38:34.352
By tomorrow,
he'll be out of the woods.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.313
That'll be good.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.357
I'm sure you've figured out by now
why you're here.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.735
And what's going to happen to you.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.029
If you think
this is going to be over quickly,

38:44.155 --> 38:46.740
you're very much mistaken.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.993
You know, Craig is a doctor.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.912
I can keep you alive for weeks.

38:53.039 --> 38:56.207
And if you think you're just going to
pass out, that's not going to happen.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.752
I have drugs
to keep you conscious.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.422
You're going to feel everything.

39:02.548 --> 39:08.428
From now until the moment you die
you will know nothing but agony.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.431
We will just keep hurting you.

39:12.141 --> 39:15.560
And hurting you.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.855
Imagine the worst pain
you've ever experienced.

39:18.981 --> 39:21.274
It will be much worse than that.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.694
By the time we're finished with you

39:24.820 --> 39:27.572
you're going to look like a cadaver
from an anatomy class.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.868
I know a million things are rushing
through your head right now.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.328
What can I do?

39:33.454 --> 39:35.789
How can I change
what's happening to me?

39:35.915 --> 39:38.541
How can I change their minds?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.544
Well you can't.

39:41.670 --> 39:45.715
There's nothing you can say or do
that will change any of this.

39:45.841 --> 39:48.259
You sealed your fate.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.265
See you in the morning.

39:58.813 --> 40:02.690
- You coming?
- I'll be there in a minute.

40:16.455 --> 40:18.456
Don't try to talk.

41:18.350 --> 41:19.601
I got this.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.733
Hello.

41:26.859 --> 41:30.028
'Mrs Landry,
this is Detective Berger.

41:32.031 --> 41:35.158
- Mrs Landry?
- 'Yes, hi.'

41:35.284 --> 41:40.163
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
Kozlowski has escaped.

41:40.289 --> 41:43.958
'The prison transport that was carrying
him was commandeered.'

41:44.084 --> 41:45.502
Commandeered?

41:45.628 --> 41:47.962
'We want you to know
we've put the world on this.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.964
'By the off chance
that he tries to reach you,

41:50.090 --> 41:52.258
'l want you to call us directly.

41:52.384 --> 41:53.718
- 'We will find him.'
- Elise?

41:53.844 --> 41:55.887
'I'm on my way to his house now
to look for him.'

41:56.013 --> 41:58.348
OK, thank you.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.935
Elise... I'm sorry.

42:20.913 --> 42:23.498
'Daddy, where's mum?

42:26.210 --> 42:28.920
'Daddy?
Can you tuck me in, please?'

42:29.046 --> 42:33.508
'Tuck you in?'
'l can't sleep, I'm too scared.'

42:33.634 --> 42:37.512
'Well, what are you scared of?
I would never let anyone hurt you.'

42:37.638 --> 42:41.808
'Daddy, I'm scared.
Can I sleep with you and Mummy?'

43:29.148 --> 43:32.650
No more painkillers for you,
asshole.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.415
Just in case
you need to use the bathroom.

44:30.542 --> 44:32.543
You sick fuck!

44:46.392 --> 44:50.395
I'm going to make sure
you get the death penalty, asshole!

46:09.767 --> 46:11.601
Shut up!

46:18.192 --> 46:20.026
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

46:35.918 --> 46:38.002
Would you...

47:31.306 --> 47:34.475
Don't you fucking scream,
you cocksucker!

47:41.692 --> 47:43.901
Are you OK?

47:44.027 --> 47:47.530
No, I'm...
I'm really far from OK, Craig.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.532
What are we doing?

47:50.868 --> 47:54.537
What are we doing?
What you wanted us to do.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.915
I don't think I can do this.

47:58.041 --> 48:00.793
Elise, we are doing this.

48:00.919 --> 48:06.007
It's done, he's here.
There's no turning back, not now.

48:07.175 --> 48:09.010
He showed no mercy for our son.

48:09.136 --> 48:12.179
He tortured Benjamin to death.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.807
That's not a person
lying on that table.

48:14.933 --> 48:17.518
It's a fucking monster.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.286
You think you got a reprieve,
you couldn't be more wrong.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.663
You sick son of a bitch.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.761
You ever had a swimmer's cramp?

48:51.887 --> 48:54.430
It's a real bitch, isn't it?

48:54.556 --> 48:57.141
And that's just one muscle
cramping up.

48:57.267 --> 48:59.936
Now imagine all your muscles
cramping up at the same time.

49:06.151 --> 49:07.652
It's terrifying, isn't it?

49:08.737 --> 49:10.571
Here it comes.

49:28.006 --> 49:29.924
Wake up! Wake up!

49:34.262 --> 49:35.930
It's amazing
what one needle can do.

49:36.056 --> 49:39.433
You see, this needle's going
to keep you conscious and aware...

49:53.657 --> 49:57.076
while this needle
will inflict more pain

49:57.202 --> 49:59.620
than you've ever felt
in your life.

49:59.746 --> 50:02.581
My son begged for his life.

50:02.708 --> 50:05.835
He screamed for you to show him mercy,
but you didn't listen.

50:05.961 --> 50:07.128
You didn't hear him.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.797
Maybe you were fucking deaf!

50:09.923 --> 50:12.216
This needle's going
to shatter your eardrum

50:12.342 --> 50:13.926
and destroy your ear canal.

50:14.052 --> 50:15.553
Stay fucking still!

50:15.679 --> 50:19.432
Because if you move, it could
cause you to bleed inside your skull

50:19.558 --> 50:22.768
and that blood will become trapped
and it'll drain into your throat.

50:22.894 --> 50:26.313
And since you're gagged,
you'll start to fucking choke!

50:26.440 --> 50:30.568
In about an hour or so, you'll drown
in your own fucking blood.

50:30.694 --> 50:34.613
So if I were you, I'd stay still.

51:25.415 --> 51:27.833
Craig. Craig, Craig wake up.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.419
It's the car alarm.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.747
Oh, yeah?

52:07.707 --> 52:09.875
That's interesting.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.636
I've done quite a bit of research
on torture specifically for this occasion.

53:05.015 --> 53:08.642
I wonder if you're familiar
with the game of Slonik?

53:12.689 --> 53:15.608
It means 'little elephant'
in Russian.

53:15.734 --> 53:16.775
See?

53:18.153 --> 53:21.322
Very popular
with the Soviet Secret Police.

53:21.448 --> 53:24.450
And also very effective.

53:24.576 --> 53:26.410
Gel.

53:49.809 --> 53:54.355
Stop moving
or I will pour this on your face.

53:54.481 --> 54:00.110
Good boy.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.030
Do you know that drowning people
actually scratch their faces

54:03.156 --> 54:05.449
before they take
their first fatal breath of water?

54:05.575 --> 54:10.287
Yes, their hunger for air
is that great.

54:10.413 --> 54:13.499
You see, the difference between
suffocation and drowning

54:13.625 --> 54:16.794
is that when you're drowning, you have
a choice to take that last breath of water

54:16.920 --> 54:18.337
and end your suffering.

54:18.463 --> 54:20.714
But not in this case.

54:21.758 --> 54:24.260
Soon the cells of your body
will start demanding oxygen

54:24.386 --> 54:26.804
and then they'll
start screaming for it.

54:26.930 --> 54:29.723
Your need for oxygen
will create an urge to breathe.

54:29.849 --> 54:31.767
The greatest urge imaginable.

54:31.893 --> 54:34.395
An urge you won't be able
to fulfill.

54:34.521 --> 54:36.438
You suffocated my son.

54:36.564 --> 54:39.149
Now you're going to feel
what it's like.

54:39.276 --> 54:43.195
How does that feel?

54:46.283 --> 54:48.617
I want to know how someone
like you can justify

54:48.743 --> 54:50.577
the sick shit that you do?

54:52.038 --> 54:54.164
How you can derive pleasure
from other people's pain?

54:54.291 --> 54:57.543
- That's enough breathing.
- Shall we do it again?

55:03.300 --> 55:06.135
No mother
should have to bury their child.

55:08.972 --> 55:12.182
No mother
should outlive her son.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.518
This is what it feels like
to not have control.

55:14.644 --> 55:18.188
This is how our son felt,
you fucking piece of shit!

55:18.315 --> 55:19.732
You like it?

55:19.858 --> 55:21.567
How does it feel?

55:21.693 --> 55:24.194
- How does it fucking feel?
- Craig, stop it!

55:24.321 --> 55:26.739
- You like it?
- Craig, stop it!

55:32.287 --> 55:34.204
He's dead.

55:35.957 --> 55:36.957
No.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.587
No! No! No!

55:41.713 --> 55:43.797
- No, Craig!
- It's not enough! We're not done!

55:43.923 --> 55:45.424
- Craig, it's over.
- No, it's not nearly over!

55:45.550 --> 55:47.051
- Stop it!
- He took our son!

55:47.177 --> 55:49.178
And we just took his life!

55:55.393 --> 55:58.145
- Did you lock the front door?
- I don't know.

55:58.271 --> 55:59.938
- Elise, go.
- What do you want me to do?

56:00.065 --> 56:01.565
Just go! Deal with it!

56:01.691 --> 56:05.110
But whatever's up there
cannot come down here!

56:27.342 --> 56:29.051
Come on.

56:44.609 --> 56:46.735
Craig!

56:46.861 --> 56:49.947
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

56:54.869 --> 56:57.121
Motherfucker, come on.

56:58.623 --> 57:00.791
- Squatters, huh?
- What?

57:00.917 --> 57:03.127
This cottage belongs
to old Frank Jessop

57:03.253 --> 57:05.129
and you're squatting
on his property.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.259
Come on.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.222
Please call your dog off.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.933
I'll call my dog,
when I damn well please.

57:18.059 --> 57:20.352
I... I'm a real estate agent.

57:20.478 --> 57:22.146
I'm showing this property
to a client of mine.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.522
That's bullshit, lady.

57:23.648 --> 57:26.650
Mr Jessop died over a year ago.

57:26.776 --> 57:29.027
This property's been
on the market ever since.

57:34.993 --> 57:37.744
So what are all those noises
downstairs?

57:38.496 --> 57:40.998
We're checking the foundation
of the building.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.916
Got any Id on you?

57:43.042 --> 57:45.043
Yes, I do.

57:56.764 --> 57:59.266
What's your name?
You're trespassing on state property,

57:59.392 --> 58:01.977
waving a gun around,
making threats.

58:02.937 --> 58:05.939
- Where's this client of yours?
- Right here.

58:09.486 --> 58:10.819
Well, Elise.

58:11.988 --> 58:14.281
This place sure is charming

58:14.407 --> 58:16.408
but I am concerned
about the basement.

58:17.702 --> 58:19.369
Is everything OK up here?

58:20.872 --> 58:23.707
I don't know,
is everything OK up here?

58:26.294 --> 58:28.170
I'm checking
that story of yours.

58:29.172 --> 58:30.172
Come on, boy.

58:34.219 --> 58:36.094
Jesus Christ.

58:36.221 --> 58:37.304
He's alive.

58:37.430 --> 58:38.889
Come on.

58:59.160 --> 59:02.037
- Detective Berger.
- U.S. Marshall Lynn Conover here.

59:02.163 --> 59:04.915
I've got some good news for you.
We've got a break in your case.

59:05.041 --> 59:08.085
'A woman here says
she saw a prison van three days ago'

59:08.211 --> 59:10.254
just off of old Howell Ranch Road.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.673
Stay there, I'm on my way.

59:13.341 --> 59:15.467
Wake up! Wake up!

59:18.429 --> 59:20.013
No. Wait, wait.

59:20.139 --> 59:21.723
I don't know
what you're talking about.

59:21.849 --> 59:22.975
Put the tape on.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.935
No. Wait, wait.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.104
I don't remember anything.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.064
I don't know who you are.

59:29.190 --> 59:31.024
I don't even know who I am.

59:31.150 --> 59:34.069
You don't remember who you are?

59:34.195 --> 59:38.031
I remember some kind
of a car accident.

59:42.704 --> 59:43.954
I don't believe him.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.623
I don't believe you.
This is too convenient!

59:50.211 --> 59:53.547
Craig! Where are you going?

59:55.133 --> 59:59.886
- I can't remember a thing.
- I don't believe you.

01:00:14.235 --> 01:00:19.364
Could it be true?

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:23.285
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:27.039
Yes. I mean, he did suffer
a serious head injury,

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.374
memory loss could be possible.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.544
Fuck. Fuck!

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.346
- God, what do we do?
- I don't know.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.598
What if he's lying?

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.977
That's also a possibility
considering his circumstances.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:52.648
But there's no way
to know for sure.

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:56.443
So, that's it then?

01:00:56.569 --> 01:01:00.405
We just leave him here?
All this for nothing?

01:01:00.531 --> 01:01:03.700
Craig, he cannot
get off that easy.

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:07.079
That animal needs to pay
for what he's done.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.456
God, listen to yourself.

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:12.292
You want to torture a man who has
no idea why we're doing it to him?

01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:16.171
It's the same guy.
It's the same guy!

01:01:32.146 --> 01:01:33.647
Shit.

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:37.401
- Detective Berger?
- Yeah.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.986
- U.S. Marshal Conover.
- Nice to meet you. What do we know?

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.905
We've got a lot.
We've got a second lead.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.783
We've got a local here who says
our convicts are held up in some cabin.

01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:46.618
Do we know where?

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:49.579
He's on his way now to give us
a pinpoint but it's in this area.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:53.291
The problem is this area
is 10,000 square miles of forest.

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.837
Wake up. Wake up!

01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.631
Wake up! Come on, get up.

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:02.342
What's she doing?

01:02:02.468 --> 01:02:04.219
You say
you don't remember anything.

01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:05.846
I know you're lying.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.265
What was my son's name?

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.560
I didn't...

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:14.354
I don't know, lady.

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:23.572
Come on.
Come on, that's nothing.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.615
That didn't hurt.
This is nothing.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.118
What was my son's name?

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.579
No, stop, please!

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:40.881
Just say his name.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:44.259
Just say his name.
I'm not going to stop.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.929
Somebody help me, please!

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:56.730
You broke 18 bones in his body.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.148
This is nothing.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.108
Say his name!

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:11.787
Say his fucking name!

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:15.207
Benjamin! His name is Benjamin!

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:18.627
I'm sorry. Please stop! Please!

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:23.548
Still believe
he doesn't remember?

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.471
You think that hurt?

01:03:29.597 --> 01:03:33.016
It's going to get
a lot worse tomorrow.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.074
No... No!

01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:09.928
So what do you have to tell us?

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:13.223
- I told you... I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.811
"I'm sorry"
is not going cut it.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.108
But these will.

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.954
No, no, no...

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.342
No!

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:12.324
You crushed my boy's liver.

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:29.841
No!

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.305
Oh, fuck!

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.892
Fuck this fucking shit!

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:43.271
I can't take this any more.

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:45.732
Get me out of there!

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:18.932
Now what?

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:28.441
So we just pick up tomorrow
where we left off?

01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:33.321
Have breakfast,
get our tools ready.

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:00.265
We could just walk away,

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:04.477
call the cops, he'd go to jail
and we could just disappear.

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:08.106
I just want Ben back.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:15.071
- I want him back so bad.
- Yeah, I know.

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.741
So do I.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.054
He's held up in a cabin,
up the road.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.556
- Can't miss it.
- Appreciate it.

01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:43.391
All right everybody, listen up!

01:07:43.517 --> 01:07:47.395
This is it.
Spread out, stay alert.

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:51.816
Come on, boy.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.363
Spread out!

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.448
Come on, boy! Find him, boy!

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:14.083
Craig! Craig!

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:19.505
Come on. Let's get him back
on the table before he wakes up.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.389
Craig!

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.582
- Where is he?
- Oh, God.

01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:57.335
He just...
He walked out the front door.

01:10:57.461 --> 01:11:00.880
- You OK?
- He just stared at me.

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:04.550
- We can't let him get away.
- Be careful.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.868
This way.

01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:41.004
Come on, boy.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.935
There he is!

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:00.815
Freeze!

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.155
Cuff him!

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.621
'As you can see behind me,
authorities have now located

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.165

- 'He tortured Benjamin to death.'
