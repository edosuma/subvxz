8:00 A. M. AND YOU'RE
NOT IN MAKEUP YET?

00:05.005 --> 00:07.173
OKAY, EITHER
YOU'RE DEPRESSED

00:07.240 --> 00:11.111
OR THAT TRANSVESTITE BURGLAR'S
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AGAIN.

00:11.177 --> 00:16.315
CAN'T I LET ME PORES BREATHE
WITHOUT RAISING AN EYEBROW?

00:16.382 --> 00:18.284
KHADIJAH, HER FACE
IS THE SAME COLOR

00:18.351 --> 00:20.053
AS THE REST OF HER.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.355
SOMETHING IS AMISS.

00:22.422 --> 00:24.390
REGINE, IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO GET UP

00:24.457 --> 00:25.692
AND FIX ME BREAKFAST

00:25.759 --> 00:28.461
AT LEAST GIVE ME TEN BUCKS
TO GO TO THE DENNY'S.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.430
( groans )

00:30.496 --> 00:33.233
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG?
WOO‐WOO?

00:33.299 --> 00:35.969
I'M JUST
A LITTLE DOWN, OKAY?

00:36.036 --> 00:40.507
EVER SINCE KEITH AND I BROKE UP,
I HAVEN'T MET ANYBODY DECENT

00:40.574 --> 00:43.243
AND AFTER AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS,
DUKE AND DENNY

00:43.309 --> 00:46.146
LEFT MY SOAP OPERA,
THE RATINGS HAVE DROPPED SO LOW

00:46.212 --> 00:47.781
THERE'S TALK OF LAYOFFS.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.951
AND DON'T FORGET YOUR BIOLOGICAL
CLOCK IS TICKING SO LOUD

00:51.017 --> 00:53.887
I CAN HEAR IT OVER AT MY PLACE.

00:55.255 --> 00:58.959
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO
OVER THERE AND LISTEN TO IT?!

01:00.734 --> 01:02.202
NOW, WHAT ABOUT
THAT CUTE GUY

01:02.268 --> 01:04.304
YOU MET AT THE BANK
THIS WEEK‐‐ BRIAN?

01:04.370 --> 01:06.740
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT
HE WAS CASING THE JOINT.

01:06.807 --> 01:09.843
HE HELD IT UP THE NEXT DAY.

01:09.909 --> 01:12.278
WELL, HE GOT MONEY.

01:12.345 --> 01:14.748
LISTEN, AS FAR AS LOSING
YOUR JOB IS CONCERNED

01:14.815 --> 01:16.382
THOSE ARE JUST
SHOW BIZ RUMORS.

01:16.449 --> 01:18.151
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

01:18.218 --> 01:20.253
YESTERDAY, THEY FIRED
ALL THE WRITERS

01:20.320 --> 01:22.723
AND TOLD THE ACTORS TO WING IT.

01:22.789 --> 01:26.292
PEOPLE ACTUALLY WRITE THAT CRAP?

01:26.359 --> 01:28.729
MAYBE YOU DO HAVE
GOOD REASON TO FEEL DOWN

01:28.795 --> 01:30.363
BUT WHENEVER
I FEEL THAT WAY

01:30.430 --> 01:33.600
I REACH INTO MY BAG FOR TWO
LITTLE ROUND PICK‐ME‐UPS.

01:38.639 --> 01:42.843

DO WE DO DRUGS?

01:42.909 --> 01:45.078
NO‐‐ WIND CHIME EARRINGS.

01:47.113 --> 01:49.382
TRY THEM ON.

01:51.785 --> 01:53.286
ALL RIGHT...

01:53.353 --> 01:56.089
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:56.156 --> 01:58.825

THINK ABOUT IT.

02:37.037 --> 02:38.171
IF MAJESTIC PUBLISHING

02:38.238 --> 02:39.740
PURCHASED A SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF <i>FLAVOR</i>

02:39.806 --> 02:41.842
YOU COULD DOUBLE
YOUR READERSHIP

02:53.854 --> 02:56.022

THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN <i>FLAVOR</i>

02:58.024 --> 03:01.502
IS BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE RIP‐OFF
MAGAZINE WENT DOWN THE TOILET.

03:01.568 --> 03:05.806
NOW, SAVOR DID NOT
GO DOWN THE TOILET.

03:05.872 --> 03:08.308
MAJESTIC JUST USED
THE FIRST 10,000 ISSUES

03:08.374 --> 03:11.545
TO KICK OFF OUR NEW

03:11.612 --> 03:14.114

KHADIJAH, MY FATHER,
JEREMY MILLS III

03:17.050 --> 03:18.351
TAUGHT ME TWO THINGS‐‐

03:18.418 --> 03:20.086
ONE: NEVER GIVE UP;

03:20.153 --> 03:22.322
TWO: NEVER GIVE UP.

03:22.388 --> 03:25.158
HE HAD A SHORT‐TERM
MEMORY PROBLEM.

YOU INHERITED IT

03:30.063 --> 03:32.766
GET OUT AND DON'T COME BACK

03:32.833 --> 03:36.603
AND BY THE WAY,
GET OUT AND DON'T COME BACK.

03:40.641 --> 03:43.544
IVAN, IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR NECK?

03:43.610 --> 03:45.846
MY SUBWAY TOKEN
ROLLED UNDER THE PHOTOCOPIER.

03:45.912 --> 03:48.181
I TRIED TO LIFT IT
AND SOMETHING POPPED.

03:48.248 --> 03:51.217
IT ONLY HURTS WHEN I USE
MY NECK TO HOLD UP MY HEAD.

03:52.553 --> 03:54.120
SEE THAT, BOSS LADY?

03:54.187 --> 03:56.623
MAJESTIC'S HEALTH PLAN
WOULD FIX IVAN'S NECK.

03:56.690 --> 03:58.625
AND PAY FOR SOME SURGERY

03:58.692 --> 04:01.234
I WANT ONE OF MY
GIRLFRIENDS TO HAVE.

04:01.301 --> 04:03.303
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENS

04:03.369 --> 04:06.973
WHEN A BIG COMPANY BUYS
PART OF A LITTLE ONE?

04:07.040 --> 04:08.809
YOU GET A HEALTH PLAN?
AND RAISES?

04:08.875 --> 04:12.212

YOU CALL FOR A PERSONAL DAY
FROM JAMAICA, YOU GET FIRED.

04:22.889 --> 04:25.491
YOU ASK YOUR BOSS
TO BEAR YOUR CHILDREN

04:25.559 --> 04:27.293
YOU GET SUED.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.329
YOU BRING A DAMNED
HAMSTER TO WORK

04:29.395 --> 04:31.264
YOU'RE GETTING SUSPENDED.

04:31.331 --> 04:37.170
BUT... BUT ROBESPIERRE
GETS SO LONELY AT HOME.

04:37.236 --> 04:40.674
KHADIJAH, I GOT A JOB
OFFER FROM <i>ROLLING STONE</i>

04:40.741 --> 04:42.709
AND I'M TEMPTED TO TAKE IT.

04:42.776 --> 04:48.014
RUSSELL, YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC
AND YOU COMMENT ON IT.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.784
YOU'RE LIKE
A JAMAICAN DICK CLARK.

04:50.851 --> 04:53.687
WHY IS IT WHENEVER
I THINK I GOT YOU

04:53.754 --> 04:56.289
YOU MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE A GOAT HEAD?

04:56.356 --> 04:59.626
( Jamaican accent ):
'CAUSE I'M SMARTER THAN YOU.

04:59.693 --> 05:01.635
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.204
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO HIRED HER.

05:04.270 --> 05:08.041
SPEAK, ROBESPIERRE. SPEAK.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.644
OH. I THINK I SEE
THE PROBLEM.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.647
YOU'VE BEEN DEPRECIATING
YOUR COPIER FOR FOUR YEARS

05:13.714 --> 05:16.650
WHEN LEGALLY, YOU CAN
ONLY DO IT FOR THREE.

05:16.717 --> 05:20.654
I OWE THE GOVERNMENT
ANOTHER "G" ON TOP OF
ALL MY OTHER DEBTS?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.989
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PAY MY STAFF?

05:23.056 --> 05:26.192

NOT A MAGIC WAND, BABY.

A GREAT DAY TO BE ALIVE?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.698
( loud gong )

05:34.167 --> 05:38.471
IT'S RAINING AND I HAVE GAS.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.841
WELL, RAIN MAKES
THE FLOWERS GROW

05:40.907 --> 05:45.478
AND GAS MEANS PEOPLE
LEAVE YOU ALONE SO YOU CAN REST.

CRYSTALS AND INCENSE.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.074
OOH! A CANDY APPLE.

06:08.141 --> 06:10.143
STAY AWAY FROM THAT CANDY APPLE.

06:10.210 --> 06:13.246
I USED IT TO KNOCK A COUPLE
DENTS OUT OF THE VAN.

06:13.313 --> 06:14.480
HOW ABOUT THIS?

06:14.548 --> 06:16.750

AN INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGE

OH!

06:33.233 --> 06:36.469
WELL, REGINE, WHERE AM I
SUPPOSED TO STICK THIS?

06:39.840 --> 06:42.342
HERE'S YOUR TEA,
KHADIJAH.

06:42.408 --> 06:44.678
THIS PUPPY'S LOOKING
A LITTLE WEAK.

06:44.745 --> 06:47.280
THAT'S 'CAUSE WE'RE
OUT OF PETTY CASH.

06:47.347 --> 06:49.916
THAT THERE IS
THE COMPANY TEA BAG.

06:49.983 --> 06:53.687
I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN
KIND OF TIGHT AROUND HERE

06:53.754 --> 06:55.622

IN THE FUTURE

06:55.689 --> 06:57.858

OF IMPROVEMENTS.

FOR YOU, KHADIJAH.

06:59.693 --> 07:00.967
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

07:01.034 --> 07:03.336
I GOT TO GET THIS
TO THE BOYS IN THE BACK.

07:03.403 --> 07:06.540
WHO TOOK THE LEMON WEDGE?!

07:06.607 --> 07:10.076
AT LEAST THINK ABOUT LETTING
MAJESTIC INVEST IN <i>FLAVOR.</i>

07:10.143 --> 07:11.812
THIS MONTH, WE HAD SO MANY BILLS

07:11.878 --> 07:13.614
WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET
THE ISSUE OUT.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.315
BUT WE DID GET IT OUT

07:15.381 --> 07:17.651

A COUPLE OF THOSE BILLS

07:17.718 --> 07:19.586
AND I SOLD A CAPITAL ASSET.

07:19.653 --> 07:21.788
WHAT'S A CAPITAL ASSET?

07:21.855 --> 07:25.325

THE PHOTOCOPIER WENT?

BOSS LADY, THE DONKEY
DROPPINGS HAVE HIT THE FAN!

07:29.062 --> 07:31.131
THE PRINTER CAN'T DO
THIS MONTH'S ISSUE.

07:31.197 --> 07:32.365
WHY NOT? I PAID THE BILL.

07:32.432 --> 07:34.167
NO, NO. A PIPE BROKE

07:34.234 --> 07:36.503
AND THE PRINT SHOP
IS FLOODED.

07:36.570 --> 07:38.839
THE GOOD NEWS IS
THE RECEPTIONIST LOOKS

07:38.905 --> 07:41.041

IN A WET T‐SHIRT.

MY MONEY, MAN.

TO PANIC.

FEEL FREE TO PICK UP THE PHONE
AND LOOK FOR ANOTHER JOB.

08:16.016 --> 08:18.418

IF YOU NEED A REFERENCE,
THEY CAN CALL ME, GIRL.

08:26.827 --> 08:29.495
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A JOB.

08:29.563 --> 08:31.598
I'M SELLING MY SOUL.

08:31.665 --> 08:34.768
YES, JEREMY MILLS, PLEASE.

08:34.835 --> 08:37.070

08:37.136 --> 08:40.006

STILL INTERESTED

IN BUYING A PIECE
OF MY MAGAZINE?

08:48.849 --> 08:50.450
OOH, MAN, I LOVE AMERICA.

08:50.517 --> 08:52.452
I SELL A QUARTER
OF MY MAGAZINE

08:52.519 --> 08:55.088
AND I GET NEW COMPUTERS,
NEW FURNITURE.

08:55.155 --> 08:58.859
OH, MAN, I EVEN GOT MY NEW DOOR!

08:58.925 --> 09:00.934
SEE, I CAN GO IN...
I CAN GO OUT.

09:01.001 --> 09:04.137
IN, OUT...
I CAN JUST CHILL IN THE DOORWAY.

09:04.204 --> 09:06.439

BE TROUBLE?

EH, EH, FORGOT MY BISCOTTI.

09:29.896 --> 09:32.165
YOU DRESS HER UP
IN A BRAND‐NEW DESK

09:32.232 --> 09:33.667
AND SHE STILL WON'T WORK.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.837
I BOUGHT THIS INSPIRATIONAL BOOK
FOR REGINE.

09:36.903 --> 09:40.406

09:40.473 --> 09:43.744

YOU CAN'T TELL WHEN THEY STALE.

NOT HINDER

10:12.546 --> 10:13.847
UH, JUST ONE MORE THING.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.783
NOW, EVERYONE PLEASE
KEEP IN MIND

10:16.850 --> 10:20.754
THAT ALL FINAL DECISIONS
REST WITH KHADIJAH‐‐

10:20.821 --> 10:24.490
EXCEPT FOR ONE DECISION THAT
I'VE ALREADY MADE ON MY OWN.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.159
AS OF TODAY

10:26.226 --> 10:28.762
ALL EMPLOYEES
HAVE FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.396
( cheering )

10:30.463 --> 10:32.766
RESPECT, RESPECT.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.969
HEY, AND I ORDERED PIZZA PIES
FOR EVERYBODY.

10:38.404 --> 10:41.207
WELL, NOW THAT'S CERTAINLY
A GRACIOUS OFFER.

10:41.274 --> 10:44.044
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT I'M JUST GOING TO...

10:44.110 --> 10:47.648
CANCEL THE RESERVATIONS I MADE
FOR EVERYONE AT LE BERNADIN.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.082
JUST GOING TO DO IT.

10:50.517 --> 10:54.120
KHADIJAH, WE CAN
HAVE PIZZA ANYTIME.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.123
WE'RE TALKING
LE BERNADIN HERE.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.200
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT
IS, BUT IT SOUND FANCY.

11:01.234 --> 11:02.468
BUT I ALREADY ORDERED.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.370
KHADIJAH, KHADIJAH

11:04.437 --> 11:05.672
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

11:05.739 --> 11:07.808
40 BUCKS?

11:07.874 --> 11:10.811
YOU... YOU HAVE GOT
TO START THINKING BIGGER.

11:10.877 --> 11:13.814
FLAVOR HAS A WHOLE NEW...

11:13.880 --> 11:15.215
FLAVOR.

11:17.884 --> 11:20.120
GOOD ONE, FUNNY MAN.
GOOD ONE.

11:20.186 --> 11:22.823
COME NOW. EVERYONE
IN THE ELEVATOR. LET'S GO!

11:22.889 --> 11:24.891
LE BERNADIN.

11:24.958 --> 11:26.492
LE BERNADIN!
LE BERNADIN!
LE BERNADIN!

11:26.560 --> 11:28.161
YOU... YOU COMING, RIGHT?

11:28.228 --> 11:30.130
I WANT TO SIT NEXT TO YOU.

11:30.196 --> 11:31.497
I GOT WORK
TO FINISH UP.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.566
YOU GO AHEAD.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.167
OKAY, 'CAUSE IT'S TUESDAY

11:34.234 --> 11:37.237
AND THAT'S WHEN HENRI
MAKES HIS COQ AU VIN. UH‐HUH.

11:51.518 --> 11:53.219
WOULD YOU STOP THAT!

11:53.286 --> 11:55.121
THOSE ARE TO CHEER REGINE.

11:55.188 --> 11:58.458
WELL, EATING REGINE'S
FOOD CHEERS ME UP.

11:58.525 --> 12:00.393
HEY, SYNCLAIRE,
I FOUND SOMETHING

12:00.460 --> 12:02.669
THAT'S BOUND TO LIFT
REGINE'S SPIRITS.

12:02.736 --> 12:04.004
ALL RIGHT, NOW.

12:04.070 --> 12:06.907
<i>BOB VILA'S FUNNIEST</i>
<i>WORKSHOP MISHAPS?</i>

12:06.973 --> 12:09.142
YEAH, I FAST‐FORWARDED
TO THE PART

12:09.209 --> 12:12.278
WHERE BOB ACCIDENTALLY
SHELLACS HIS BEARD.

12:12.345 --> 12:14.080
COME ON.
REGINE WILL PERSEVERE

12:14.147 --> 12:16.349
IF SHE FOLLOWS THE ADVICE
OF VOLTAIRE:

12:16.416 --> 12:17.618
"ALL IS FOR THE BEST

12:17.684 --> 12:19.886
IN THIS BEST
OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS."

12:19.953 --> 12:24.090
YOU KNOW, THAT SIMPLE PHILOSOPHY
GOT ME THROUGH A PERIOD SO BLEAK

12:24.157 --> 12:26.893
I ACTUALLY WONDERED
IF LIFE WERE WORTH LIVING.

12:26.960 --> 12:30.030
WHEN IN THE HELL
WERE YOU SO LOW?

12:30.096 --> 12:31.698
YOU RECALL WE DID GO OUT.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.401
REGINE!

12:35.468 --> 12:37.037
MY LITTLE RAY OF SUNSHINE.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.138
HOW WAS WORK?

12:38.204 --> 12:39.706
I KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING

12:39.773 --> 12:41.474
TO PULL THE PLUG ON <i>PALO ALTO.</i>

12:41.542 --> 12:44.645
IN NEXT WEEK'S SCRIPT,
FIVE OF THE SIX MAIN CHARACTERS

12:44.711 --> 12:47.147
DIE IN A MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUS TENT EXPLOSION.

12:47.213 --> 12:49.382
WELL, YOU STILL GOT
ONE CHARACTER LEFT.

12:49.449 --> 12:53.353
MM‐HMM. SHE GOING TO THE CHAIR
FOR KILLING THEM.

12:53.419 --> 12:55.722
REGINE, HERE'S A LITTLE
CARD I PICKED UP

12:55.789 --> 12:57.858
IN THE "ENCOURAGING
WORDS" SECTION.

12:57.924 --> 12:59.459
WHEN THE CASHIER READ IT

12:59.526 --> 13:02.869
SHE INVITED ME OVER
TO WATCH <i>BEACHES.</i>

13:02.936 --> 13:05.005
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO

13:05.071 --> 13:06.940
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING, ALL RIGHT?

13:07.007 --> 13:08.675
AND IT'S GETTING ON MY NERVES

13:08.742 --> 13:11.144
SO STOP WASTING MY TIME
AND YOUR MONEY

13:11.211 --> 13:13.680
ON GREETING CARDS,
GONGS, AND GUMMI BEARS.

13:17.117 --> 13:19.886
OH, DON'T WORRY, SWEET PEA.

13:19.953 --> 13:22.856
I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST INCONSOLABLE.

13:22.923 --> 13:25.491
BUT I'M USUALLY
SO GOOD AT THIS, YOU KNOW?

13:25.559 --> 13:28.361
I MEAN, REMEMBER THE TIME
THAT THE INDIANS LOST

13:28.428 --> 13:29.730
YOUR JIGSAW BROKE

13:29.796 --> 13:32.065
AND YOU FORGOT
YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY?

13:32.132 --> 13:34.968
MAN, I HAD YOU
CHEERED UP IN NO TIME.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.803
YEAH, BUT, UH...

13:36.870 --> 13:39.305
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
WITH REGINE.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.443
GOOD POINT.

13:43.510 --> 13:45.245
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

13:47.180 --> 13:48.448
KHADIJAH.

13:48.515 --> 13:50.250
WITH THE NEW MEDICAL BENEFITS

13:50.316 --> 13:52.452
I FINALLY GOT
MY NECK CHECKED OUT.

13:52.519 --> 13:54.487
AND I'VE NEVER
FELT BETTER

13:54.555 --> 13:58.458
BUT I GOT MY ARM IN A SLING
JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT.

13:58.525 --> 14:00.934
TOMORROW I'M HAVING
MY HIPS REPLACED.

14:01.001 --> 14:04.671
JEREMY, I'VE HAD
A REAL BRAINSTORM.

14:04.738 --> 14:06.807
NOW, HOW ABOUT I FLY TO HAVANA

14:06.873 --> 14:09.342
AND DO AN ARTICLE
ON CUBAN REGGAE, HUH?

14:09.409 --> 14:11.712
COMPELLING CONCEPT, RUSSELL

14:11.778 --> 14:16.216
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVANA
OBJECTION TO THAT.

14:16.282 --> 14:17.483
( laughing )

14:17.551 --> 14:20.687
WHOO, THEY JUST
ROLL OFF YOUR TONGUE, HUH?

14:20.754 --> 14:22.322
SEE EVERYONE IN A WEEK.

14:22.388 --> 14:23.356
UH‐UH‐UH.

14:23.423 --> 14:24.490
WHILE YOU'RE THERE

14:24.558 --> 14:26.860
WHY DON'T YOU STOP A SOLDIER

14:26.927 --> 14:28.629
AND SAY "LUCY, YOU GOT
SOME 'SPLAININ' TO DO"?

14:28.695 --> 14:29.830
BETTER YET, DON'T GO.

14:29.896 --> 14:31.031
BUT LOOK, JEREMY SAID

14:31.097 --> 14:33.166
THE CUBAN CONCEPT
WAS... "COMPELLING."

14:33.233 --> 14:35.802
RUSSELL, SHE
IS THE BOSS.

14:35.869 --> 14:37.504
MY HANDS ARE
TIED, BUDDY.

14:37.571 --> 14:41.007
WELL, THANKS ANYWAY
FOR SUPPORTING MY DREAMS.

14:41.074 --> 14:43.443
AND THANK YOU FOR DASHING THEM

14:43.510 --> 14:46.179
LIKE A DRIFTWOOD DINGHY
IN A HURRICANE.

14:48.982 --> 14:50.817
AH, KHADIJAH.
THERE'S SOMETHING

14:50.884 --> 14:52.318
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

14:52.385 --> 14:53.920
HAVE YOU GOT A SECOND?

14:56.857 --> 14:59.860
SPOKE TO THE BOYS IN FINANCE
DOWN AT MAJESTIC

14:59.926 --> 15:02.202
AND IT SEEMS I WAS
A BIT PREMATURE

15:02.268 --> 15:04.671
ABOUT THAT
HEALTH BENEFITS THING.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.306
HOW PREMATURE?

15:06.372 --> 15:08.008
WE DON'T HAVE THEM.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.243
I HOPE THIS IS ANOTHER
OF YOUR BAD JOKES

15:10.310 --> 15:11.612
BECAUSE YOGI AND BOO‐BOO

15:11.678 --> 15:14.480
JUST RACKED UP A THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN MEDICAL BILLS.

15:14.548 --> 15:17.483
WELL, I AM THE BELOVED
PEOPLE PERSON OF THIS TEAM.

15:17.551 --> 15:18.885
YOU'RE THE HATCHET MAN.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.220
CHOP CHOP.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.055
BUMP THAT.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.090
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO MAKE ME OUT

15:24.157 --> 15:25.859
TO BE THE BAD GUY ON THIS.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.093
LISTEN UP, PEOPLE.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.697
JEREMY HAS A VERY
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.

15:30.764 --> 15:34.234
YES, INDEED. AHEM...

15:34.300 --> 15:37.103
UH, NOW LISTEN UP, EVERYONE...

15:37.170 --> 15:41.174
NOW, NEXT FRIDAY,
HOLD ON TO YOUR PINEAPPLES.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.475
( chuckling )

15:42.543 --> 15:45.178
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LUAU.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.446
( cheering )

15:48.481 --> 15:49.850
OH, KHADIJAH, MAYBE

15:49.916 --> 15:52.786
I'LL GET TO SEE YOU
IN A COCONUT BRA.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.560
HEY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.335
LONG AS I DON'T HAVE
TO LISTEN.

16:04.871 --> 16:07.608
THIS IS THE CARD I GAVE YOU.

16:07.674 --> 16:09.610
YEAH, I IRONED IT
WHEN I REALIZED

16:09.676 --> 16:11.211
THAT GOOD OLD SYNCLAIRE WAS

16:11.277 --> 16:14.480
TURNING INTO
SOMEBODY A LOT LIKE ME‐‐

16:14.548 --> 16:17.250
UNHAPPY, DEPRESSED.

16:17.317 --> 16:19.152
ITCHY SCALP.

16:19.219 --> 16:20.654
ANYWAY, UM...

16:20.721 --> 16:25.125
I FELT BAD
ABOUT DOING THAT TO SOMEBODY

16:25.191 --> 16:27.828
WHO WAS TRYING TO HELP.

16:27.894 --> 16:28.962
I'M SORRY.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.496
OH, GIRL, DON'T FEEL BAD.

16:30.564 --> 16:33.499
I FOUND 78 CENTS
UNDERNEATH THE CUSHIONS.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.502
BUT THE IMPORTANT
THING IS...

16:35.569 --> 16:37.470
IS THAT YOU'RE ALL
CHEERED UP NOW.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.739
NO, I'M NOT.

16:38.805 --> 16:42.008
SYNCLAIRE, I'VE GOT
REAL PROBLEMS, ALL RIGHT?

16:42.075 --> 16:45.111
AND THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO GO AWAY OVERNIGHT.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.114
MAYBE I JUST WANT TO BE
IN A FUNK FOR A WHILE.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.785
WELL, YOU KNOW,
REGINE, YOU KNOW

16:51.852 --> 16:54.454
THREE DAYS AGO WHEN I STARTED
TO CHEER YOU UP

16:54.521 --> 16:57.658
I WISH YOU'D TOLD ME WHAT A BIG,
FAT SOURPUSS YOU ARE.

17:04.237 --> 17:06.205
GET OFF MY GONG.

17:11.011 --> 17:12.945
KHADIJAH.

17:13.012 --> 17:14.748
LET'S INTERFACE.

17:15.915 --> 17:18.151
I FOUND OUT WHAT YOU DID.

17:18.218 --> 17:21.154
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING,
GOING OVER MY HEAD?

17:21.221 --> 17:22.488
I AND ONLY I SPEAK

17:22.556 --> 17:25.025
TO THE PRESIDENT
OF MAJESTIC PUBLISHING.

17:25.090 --> 17:26.291
( giggling )

17:26.358 --> 17:28.962
LOOK WHO GREW ANTLERS.

17:29.029 --> 17:31.965
IF YOU EVER TRY TO PULL
A STUNT LIKE THAT AGAIN

17:32.032 --> 17:36.102
I WILL... WELL,
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT.

17:36.169 --> 17:39.606
LOOK, YOU PROMISED US BENEFITS
AND THEN YOU PUNKED OUT

17:39.673 --> 17:41.407
SO I WENT TO THE HEAD PUNK.

17:41.474 --> 17:43.109
AND THREATENED TO QUIT.

17:43.176 --> 17:44.310
VERY SMART.

17:44.377 --> 17:45.846
WELL, IT GOT US BENEFITS.

17:45.912 --> 17:48.849
AND IT ALSO MADE THE 17th
RICHEST MAN IN AMERICA

17:48.915 --> 17:50.316
VERY UNHAPPY.

17:50.383 --> 17:52.586
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HAD GIVEN ME MORE TIME

17:52.653 --> 17:54.454
I COULD HAVE GOT THE BENEFITS

17:54.521 --> 17:56.256
WITHOUT RUFFLING ANY FEATHERS.

17:56.322 --> 17:57.991
YOU KNOW, YOU ARE JUST BUGGIN'

17:58.058 --> 18:00.594
BECAUSE I GOT SOMETHING DONE
THAT YOU COULDN'T.

18:00.661 --> 18:05.305
ACTUALLY, I'M BUGGING BECAUSE
YOU DON'T SHOW ME ANY RESPECT.

18:05.371 --> 18:07.473
( snickering )

18:07.541 --> 18:08.809
WHY SHOULD I?

18:08.875 --> 18:11.344
LOOK, DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY

18:11.411 --> 18:14.114
BUT ARE A USELESS
CORPORATE KISS‐ASS.

18:17.150 --> 18:18.985
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

18:19.052 --> 18:22.022
OH, THIS IS JUST THE
USELESS PHOTOCOPIER

18:22.088 --> 18:25.491
THIS USELESS CORPORATE
KISS‐ASS PROMISED YOU.

18:25.559 --> 18:26.827
DON'T TRY TO PASS OFF

18:26.893 --> 18:29.295
GETTING A PHOTOCOPIER
AS BEING REAL WORK.

18:29.362 --> 18:31.898
WHILE YOU ARE SNACKING
ON BRIE AT THE BALLET

18:31.965 --> 18:33.767
WE'RE HERE
BUSTING OUR BEHINDS.

18:33.834 --> 18:36.970
OH, I SEE. YOU WANT TO
SEE ME IN THE TRENCHES.

18:37.037 --> 18:38.872
WELL, I'M UP FOR ANY CHORE.

18:38.939 --> 18:41.842
WELL, THE COWS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN MILKED

18:41.908 --> 18:43.443
SO WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE

18:43.510 --> 18:46.246
UNTIL THE MAGAZINE
IS PUT TO BED TONIGHT?

18:46.312 --> 18:47.981
MY PLEASURE.

18:48.048 --> 18:50.450
ANYONE WANT TO
SEE <i>SWAN LAKE?</i>

18:50.517 --> 18:51.852
HERE.

18:54.521 --> 18:57.791
MEZZANINE?

18:57.858 --> 18:59.526
FORGET IT, BUDDY.

19:14.881 --> 19:16.717
IVAN!

19:18.685 --> 19:20.086
YOU FELL ASLEEP.

19:20.153 --> 19:21.555
ARE WE STILL MARRIED?

19:22.856 --> 19:26.159
KHADIJAH, IT IS 4:00 A. M.

19:26.226 --> 19:29.029
IF I DON'T GET SOME REST
I'M GOING TO SLEEP

19:29.095 --> 19:31.231
RIGHT THROUGH MY
RELAXATION CLASS.

19:31.297 --> 19:33.834
WELL, ANY TIME YOU WANT
TO CONCEDE DEFEAT

19:33.900 --> 19:35.001
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

19:35.068 --> 19:36.169
ALL RIGHT.

19:36.236 --> 19:37.504
ALL RIGHT, KHADIJAH.

19:37.571 --> 19:40.507
I WILL ADMIT THAT I
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESPECT

19:40.574 --> 19:42.876
FOR WHAT IT TAKES TO
PUT A MAGAZINE OUT

19:42.943 --> 19:44.410
IF YOU'LL ADMIT

19:44.477 --> 19:47.514
PEOPLE SKILLS ARE AN
IMPORTANT PART OF MANAGEMENT.

19:47.581 --> 19:49.983
OH, SO THAT'S THE KEY
TO YOUR SUCCESS.

19:50.050 --> 19:52.986
THAT AND THE FACT
MY GREAT‐GRANDFATHER

19:53.053 --> 19:56.523
DISCOVERED OIL
UNDERNEATH HIS OUTHOUSE.

19:56.590 --> 20:00.734
AFTER THE INITIAL EMBARRASSMENT,
HE WAS VERY, VERY RICH.

20:00.801 --> 20:02.335
I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD BE

20:02.402 --> 20:04.437
IN BUSINESS
WITH A CORPORATE GEEK.

20:04.505 --> 20:06.472
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE IN BUSINESS

20:06.540 --> 20:08.709
WITH AN AROUND‐THE‐WAY GIRL.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.210
YOU BEEN THUMBING THROUGH

20:10.276 --> 20:12.278
THE RAP SECTION AGAIN
HAVEN'T YOU?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.482
LOOK, JEREMY,
IF I GIVE YOU STATIC

20:16.550 --> 20:19.352
IT'S BECAUSE FLAVOR
IS MORE THAN A MAGAZINE.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.687
I CREATED IT.

20:20.754 --> 20:21.855
IT'S MY BABY.

20:21.922 --> 20:24.825
A BABY I HAVE WATCHED GROW
FOR FOUR YEARS

20:24.891 --> 20:28.494
AND MY COMPANY PUBLISHES
CASH COWS LIKE...

20:28.562 --> 20:32.766
LIKE <i>MICROCHIP DIGEST</i>
AND <i>LIQUID SOAP QUARTERLY.</i>

20:32.833 --> 20:36.837
SURE, IT PAYS FOR THE CAPPED
TEETH ON MY POLO PONIES

20:36.903 --> 20:38.505
BUT <i>FLAVOR...</i>

20:38.572 --> 20:40.507
FLAVOR HAS A VOICE

20:40.574 --> 20:43.243
THAT THIS COMMUNITY
NEEDS TO HEAR.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.444
HMM.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.847
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SPEECH.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.314
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.784
HALFWAY THROUGH,
I STARTED BELIEVING IT.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.655
LOOK, JUST REMEMBER
THAT I'M THE BOSS

20:54.721 --> 20:56.256
AND EVERYTHING
WILL BE COOL.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.959
I DO HAVE THE RIGHT
TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.601
AND I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SAY NO.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.468
NOW MAY I GO HOME?

21:02.536 --> 21:03.870
NO.

21:05.706 --> 21:06.807
LOOKIE HERE. UM...

21:06.873 --> 21:08.675
HAVE EITHER OF YOU
SEEN THE KEY

21:08.742 --> 21:10.010
TO THE SUPPLY CABINET?

21:10.076 --> 21:12.913
I WANT TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE
AND I LOST MY KEY.

21:12.979 --> 21:15.415
CHECK THE CUP.

21:15.481 --> 21:16.683
( key rattling )

21:19.686 --> 21:21.454
THANKS A LOT, JEREMY.

21:21.522 --> 21:24.490
OH, SNAP, THIS IS MY HOUSE KEY.

21:24.558 --> 21:25.859
WHOO, I'M TIRED.

21:28.562 --> 21:30.496

21:30.564 --> 21:32.498

21:32.566 --> 21:34.067
