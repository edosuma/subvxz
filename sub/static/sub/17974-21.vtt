Mama, let me
get a candy bar!

00:37.471 --> 00:39.338
I want a candy
bar, too.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.206
Wait, I said
that weird.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.208
I want two
candy bars.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.177
You boys got some
candy bar money?

00:45.179 --> 00:47.046
Yes, I put it in your purse.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.915
Oh, honey, I spent
that money a long time ago.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.019
Ooh, I hope they're doing
Shakespeare in Love.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.054
Cleveland, we're going.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.056
Of course we are.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.757
Go, go.

00:58.759 --> 00:59.992
(grunts)

00:59.994 --> 01:01.193
Football.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.562
Good thing I wore
my cup to the park.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.230
Aah, cup's on backwards.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.365
Put it on over my butt.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.233
Let's play football!

01:08.235 --> 01:10.002
You can't keep up
with those guys.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.870
You get winded
opening your e-mail.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.072
(laughs)

01:13.074 --> 01:14.907
Ha, she said you...

01:14.909 --> 01:16.241
(panting)

01:16.243 --> 01:17.910
...get winded.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.079
(panting)
Somebody else talk.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.713
(sighs)

01:21.715 --> 01:23.882
Roberta, watch these boys and
don't let them have any candy.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.185
You got some
"watch these boys" money?

01:26.187 --> 01:27.886
Oh, sure thing, baby.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.354
(horn blows)

01:34.094 --> 01:37.229
(speaks low, indistinctly)

01:37.231 --> 01:38.564
(bird tweeting)

01:38.566 --> 01:40.933
(barks twice)

01:40.935 --> 01:42.434
Just a dog here.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.270
Unless there's a horny male
dog creeping up behind me.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.640
In which case, I'm just a kid
trying to steal a candy bar.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.781
I'ma burn you, sucka-punk.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.449
QUARTERBACK: Hut!
(players grunting)

01:57.451 --> 01:59.218
(snapping)
Ooh, hammy.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.285
Face!

02:00.287 --> 02:01.320
(grunts)

02:01.322 --> 02:03.288
Bones!

02:03.290 --> 02:05.791
(groans)
Oh, Donna.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.393
Donna!

02:08.395 --> 02:10.129
Cleveland, did you
mess your drawers?

02:10.131 --> 02:12.965
No, thankfully, I had
my cup on backwards.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.900
Can you kiss my oucha-oucha
boo-boos, Donna?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.468
I'm not your mother.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.303
Will you at least take
me to the drive-through

02:18.305 --> 02:20.639
for a feel-better milkshake?

02:20.641 --> 02:21.740
Come on, kids.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.442
You know the drill.

02:23.444 --> 02:24.643
(all grunting)

02:24.645 --> 02:26.478
Aah!

02:27.313 --> 02:28.981
Where did this come from?

02:28.983 --> 02:30.115
I hope a tree.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.417
Rallo, did you
steal this?

02:32.419 --> 02:34.620
What? Oh, 'cause I'm black?

02:34.622 --> 02:36.455
Well, one of you
boys stole it.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.624
And, until someone comes
clean, you're both grounded.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.758
Oh, for why?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.160
On whose authority?

02:41.162 --> 02:43.595
And, Roberta, you were
supposed to be watching them.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.796
You're grounded, too.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.666
Nah-uh, how you
gonna cage a hurricane?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.501
You know what?
Because of that...

02:49.503 --> 02:51.670
everybody's grounded!

02:51.672 --> 02:52.971
(all groan)

02:52.973 --> 02:54.773
But it's my quinceaera.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.542
You in America now.

02:59.145 --> 03:02.014
Cleveland, you need to
know your limitations.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.516
You're playing tackle football
with kids half your age.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.352
Some of those boys didn't
even have hair on their chest.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.687
Mmm.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.791
Donna, bring me pictures of
when I was young
and beautiful.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.193
I wish to look at them.

03:14.195 --> 03:17.362
Oh, Cleveland,
my poor baby.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.865
Oh, Cleveland,
my poor baby.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.466
And I'm hungry.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.634
You're not feeding him?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.536
He's wearing
all our food.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.705
I knew one day I'd walk in
here and see you on the couch

03:26.707 --> 03:28.207
covered in someone's meat.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.642
I need you to take your mama
to some country club.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.678
They gonna be hobnobbing
and cob gobbling,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.146
so naturally,
I thought of you.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.348
It's the Silver Sunset
Retirement Society's

03:36.350 --> 03:38.650
open house and I want
to be a member.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.519
Your father can't come
because he's spending

03:40.521 --> 03:42.321
the weekend putting
money on horses.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.223
Yeah, big booby horses.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.357
Well, I'm out.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.425
Bye, dorks.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.526
Bye, Dad.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.061
Please help me, Cleveland.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.564
And on the way, we can stop
for a feel-better milkshake.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.566
Can we also go
on a tugboat?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.034
Where else would
we drink it?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.569
Yay.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.073
All right, you booger eaters,
my punishment is being

04:01.075 --> 04:03.008
in charge of your punishment.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.510
And I won't tolerate
any humping, bumping,

04:05.512 --> 04:06.545
krumping, or dumping.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.579
What?

04:08.615 --> 04:10.415
Thanks a lot, Rallo.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.251
I've never been
grounded before.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.886
Look, relax,
you're squeaky clean.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.723
As long as we apologize,
Mama will unground us,

04:17.725 --> 04:21.059
time served, and you can go on
about your creepy business.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.428
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.063
You stole that candy.

04:25.065 --> 04:29.101
Fine, then I guess we're stuck
here till you change
your mind.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.936
Look away.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.704
No, don't.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.039
Get used to this.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.978
Well, at least my physical
pain's a little better.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.880
Thanks for that pill, Mom.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.349
The doctors just keep
signing the slips.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.792
Well, bang my bottom,
look at this place.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.428
Oh, Cleveland, I could
have a community here.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.096
Don't you wish
you were retiring?

04:58.098 --> 05:00.098
(sighs)
I wouldn't get in.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.136
I'm probably too weak
and frail even for these
walking corpses.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.237
No offense, Mom.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.109
Yowzers.
What an arm.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.944
That black man
can really play.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.346
Well, Lordy-loo.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.815
That was a
granddaddy of a throw.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.117
You two must be
prospective members.

05:19.119 --> 05:23.989
I'm Neighbors Kellogg,
President of the Silver
Sunset Society.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.793
I'm Cleveland
and this is Cookie.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.961
Well, come on,
lickity-split.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.831
The Tournament of Leisure
Sports and Reckless
Gin Sipping

05:32.833 --> 05:34.633
is about to begin.

05:34.635 --> 05:38.303
And with you here,
we're sure to have a gay time.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.471
You're gay.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.006
Well, thank you.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.516
Ugh, they're pathetic.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.452
Muhammad Ali could
beat these people.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.620
Heck, I could beat
these people.

05:55.622 --> 06:00.025
And that would earn me
a shot at Muhammad Ali.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.036
Yay!

06:45.038 --> 06:46.571
I'm out of my funk.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.740
King of the old people.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.577
Anything is possible!

06:52.579 --> 06:55.380
What he's trying to say is,
we love it here.

06:55.382 --> 06:58.083
And here loves you
and your husband.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.618
She's not my husband.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.554
(chuckling)
Of course not.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.790
You're exactly the type
of couple we consider

07:04.792 --> 07:06.858
for membership here
at Silver Sunset.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.893
But...

07:07.895 --> 07:08.893
Thank you, Neighbors.

07:08.895 --> 07:12.531
My husband and I are honored
to be in consideration.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.433
She was a lot hotter
when I met her.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.942
(gulping)

07:23.944 --> 07:25.644
Ah!

07:25.646 --> 07:27.746
So, Cookie, how did you
and your husband meet?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.114
Uh, well,

07:29.116 --> 07:32.083
we actually met
in Stoolbend, 42 years ago.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.285
On his birthday.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.787
Oh, oh, oh.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.255
(laughs)
She's right.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.790
We met in a hospital.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.225
In a delivery room.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.127
She had some guy
spank my bottom.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.795
Then she took me home
to her place

07:43.797 --> 07:45.597
and we've been
together ever since.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.899
Cleveland, you're adorable.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.769
My favorite animal
is a walrus.

07:50.771 --> 07:54.906
(all laughing)

07:54.908 --> 07:57.175
Well, I'll be.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.410
I've seen enough.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.812
A toast, to the newest members

08:00.814 --> 08:03.281
of the Silver Sunset Society,

08:03.283 --> 08:04.916
the Browns.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.786
We'll make it official
at the New Members Ball,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.154
night after tomorrow.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.522
(both gasp)

08:10.524 --> 08:13.492
As for tonight, you've had
too many cocktails to drive.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.759
Nine.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.762
So, we'll put you up
at the hotel across the way.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.132
I'll book you two lovebirds
in the honeymoon suite,

08:21.134 --> 08:22.501
please and yes, thank you.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.768
(laughing)

08:23.770 --> 08:26.938
(bed springs squeaking,
Cleveland laughing)

08:26.940 --> 08:29.007
Fancy hotel room!

08:30.476 --> 08:32.344
Chug, ch-- oh, you're done.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.179
(music playing on TV)

08:34.181 --> 08:37.315
It's so great watching
a rom-com with you.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.351
Donna never watches rom-coms.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.620
Never even lets
me say "rom-com."

08:41.622 --> 08:43.488
What's this rom-com, Mom?

08:43.490 --> 08:44.890
Oh, they're all the same.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.992
As long as there's a
stupid misunderstanding.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.860
And a shopping montage.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.662
BOTH:
And a race to the airport.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.964
(both laugh, sigh)

08:52.966 --> 08:56.501
How did I get so lucky to
come out of a woman like you?

08:56.503 --> 08:57.936
Don't be low-rent, sweetie.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.840
Hi, Donna.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.308
Hi, Donna's mom.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.509
Hi, Cleveland.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.811
Heard you had a little
slumber party with your mom.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.146
(both laugh)

09:08.148 --> 09:10.015
His mother's the worst.
She's all...

09:10.017 --> 09:12.350
(imitating Cookie)
Oh, Cleveland, I'ma join

09:12.352 --> 09:14.185
a fancy-people club
where they probably don't

09:14.187 --> 09:15.987
let you wear jean pants.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.689
I'm shaped like a potato.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.658
Oh, I think I've seen
her around town.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.859
She walk like this?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.894
(makes fart sounds)

09:22.896 --> 09:24.529
No, it's more like this.

09:24.531 --> 09:29.067
(both making fart sounds
and laughing)

09:32.672 --> 09:36.174
She has colitis.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.009
Ooh, sticking up for her.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.745
It sounds like your mom's
turning into your girlfriend.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.515
Oh, real fair, making
fun of me when my mom's

09:43.517 --> 09:45.350
not even here to defend me.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.552
Well, just remember,
I'm the one you married.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.421
Oh, can you pick up
a bottle of wine

09:49.423 --> 09:50.555
for Shakespeare in the Park?

09:50.557 --> 09:51.723
Of course.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.726
How else you
gonna be any fun?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.761
You got a weird husband.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.663
Who's my dad?

10:01.233 --> 10:02.934
Cleveland, look
who stopped by.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.303
Neighbors and
his second wife.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.573
I guess they were
in the Neighbors-hood.

10:08.575 --> 10:13.078
(all laughing)

10:13.080 --> 10:15.080
Get it?
His name's Neighbors?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.748
You better save
some of that wordplay

10:16.750 --> 10:19.084
for the New Members
Ball tomorrow.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.986
And tonight we'd
love you to join us

10:20.988 --> 10:22.887
for Shakespeare
in the Park.

10:22.889 --> 10:23.922
Shakespeare in the Park?

10:23.924 --> 10:24.990
They have that?

10:24.992 --> 10:27.225
Yes, it's horrible.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.760
You two should
come with us.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.061
It'll be a double date.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.098
Uh-oh, double trouble
with this crew.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.301
I'll bring this bottle of wine
I picked up for some reason.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.703
(grunting)

10:41.240 --> 10:43.475
I'm getting strong in lockup.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.643
What're you reading?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.611
We didn't have the
Koran, so I'm reading

10:46.613 --> 10:48.647
my leather-bound
Judy Blume collection.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.281
(chuckles)
That girl's called Blubber.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.117
What a fat ass.

10:52.119 --> 10:56.254
ROBERTA:
Prisoner one and prisoner
19, report downstairs.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.157
All right, just say you're
sorry and we'll be fine.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.458
I'm not saying sorry.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.626
I didn't do anything.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.962
Fine, then every
man for himself.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.797
Now, what happened?

11:05.799 --> 11:09.100
First off, I'd like to
say the punishment was fair.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.670
I was even able
to earn my TV/VCR

11:11.672 --> 11:13.304
repair certificate in here.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.374
Second, we may never know
exactly what happened

11:16.376 --> 11:18.977
that unfortunate afternoon
in the park,

11:18.979 --> 11:22.313
but I take full responsibility
for my part,

11:22.315 --> 11:25.150
whatever it may
or may not have been.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.185
That took guts, Rallo.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.520
Junior?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.188
I did not steal
that candy bar.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.723
That's it.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.793
Do you think I'm running
a clown shop, Junior?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.161
Candy chocolate bar?

11:36.163 --> 11:37.829
Your sweet teeth?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.064
I know you did it.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.165
No.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.400
Rallo, you showed remorse.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.135
You are free to go.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.338
Junior, you fat liar, you
are grounded indefinitely.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.507
What?
Hosanna!

11:49.509 --> 11:51.042
Gavel, gavel.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.410
Living room adjourned.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.482
Mama, I let Rallo go.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.550
Is that okay?

11:58.552 --> 11:59.851
Oh, you guys
still doing that?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.152
Whatever.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.821
I'm going to
Shakespeare in the Park.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.723
If Cleveland ever gets here.

12:04.725 --> 12:08.026
WOMAN:
Art though not Romeo
and a Montague?

12:08.028 --> 12:11.029
MAN:
Neither, fair saint,
either if thee dislike.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.199
WOMAN:
How camest thou hither,
tell me, and wherefore?

12:14.201 --> 12:17.202
The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb,

12:17.204 --> 12:20.105
and the place death,
considering who thou art...

12:26.045 --> 12:28.179
Good tidings, milady.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.447
Cleveland, where were you?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.182
With my mom, Mommy.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.718
We were supposed to go to
Shakespeare in the Park.

12:33.720 --> 12:38.423
Uh, Earth to Donna, we were
at Shakespeare in the Park.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.959
So you took your
mom on my date?

12:40.961 --> 12:43.261
I sat here all night
waiting for you.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.431
Also, my mom said the wine
you like isn't good.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.799
She said it's cheap.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.901
She said it was
for country people.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.469
You know what,
if your mom's so great,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.071
why don't you go
live with her?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.472
Maybe I will.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.740
Or shall.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.208
Anon. Lear.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.409
Gonorrhea.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.711
Shakespeare.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.815
(lute playing)

13:03.817 --> 13:05.283
It's good, right?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.718
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.819
You want to go home?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.721
Yeah, I've seen enough.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.263
And then she shut the
door firmly behind me.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.899
The very same door I watched

13:20.901 --> 13:24.269
her sand, stain and install.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.437
How dare she treat
my Cleveland that way?

13:26.439 --> 13:28.940
And then she kicked me
to the curb.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.076
The curb that I watched
her stencil our number on

13:32.078 --> 13:33.778
with my own eyes.

13:33.780 --> 13:36.181
You always did
have good eyes.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.017
Wow, mac and cheese
for breakfast?

13:39.019 --> 13:42.420
I don't know whether to put
ketchup or maple syrup on it.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.922
Why not both?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.456
I can't make these things
for your dad

13:45.458 --> 13:46.691
because he has
high blood pressure.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.959
I do, too.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.460
I just don't care.

13:49.462 --> 13:53.331
Thanks for being there
for me, Mrs. Brown.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.866
Well, thanks
for helping me get

13:54.868 --> 13:58.136
into the Silver
Sunset Society, Mr. Brown.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.104
(giggles)

14:02.775 --> 14:05.210
Your lunch, Mr. Brown.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.278
Thank you, Mrs. Brown.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.214
What do we got today?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.448
Oh, okay.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.783
Mac and cheese.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.017
Again.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.319
I know it's your favorite.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.486
Yep, used to be.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.788
Good memory.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.790
Oh, so guess who I ran
into at the market?

14:18.792 --> 14:19.824
No idea.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.059
Gina Hefner.
Uh-huh.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.293
And she told me a very
interesting thing.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.962
You remember the Hefners?
Uh-huh.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.697
Well, you remember Trudy
Hefner?
Never heard of her.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.165
I think she was a couple
years younger than you.
Yeah.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.666
And her brother
ran track?
Okay.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.301
They had a parade
for him, I think.
What?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.637
Oh, and that's the family
that used to walk everywhere.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.038
Remember, that we would see?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.841
I do remember that
we would see them.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.843
Ah...

14:38.845 --> 14:40.011
ANNOUNCER:
Shakes off the tackle,
he's on the 15...

14:40.013 --> 14:41.346
Snack time, Mr. Brown?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.648
That was the end
of the game, Mrs. Brown,

14:43.650 --> 14:47.552
and you can't
pause a 1975 Zenith.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.254
Here, I made you
a little mac snack.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.023
Well, I just ate lunch
20 minutes ago.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.659
Now eat it quick, 'cause I'm
taking you to
the fabric store.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.361
I'm making you
some new pants.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.029
COOKIE:
Cleveland!

14:58.031 --> 15:00.365
Are you done going through
those boxes of your old stuff?

15:00.367 --> 15:02.166
Still doing it, Ma.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.402
Been down here
a minute and a half.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.604
Woman's got no
concept of time.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.539
COOKIE:
You want to come with me
to the beauty parlor?

15:08.541 --> 15:09.707
Kind of beauty parlored out.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.175
COOKIE:
All right.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.211
Well, I'll be back
after I stop at the store

15:13.213 --> 15:15.046
to pick up some more
mac and cheese.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.547
Ugh.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.049
(door closes)
Finally,

15:18.051 --> 15:20.852
I can get out of these
stupid homemade pants.

15:20.854 --> 15:24.022
(groaning and grunting)

15:24.024 --> 15:26.090
Cleveland, I forgot to ask...

15:26.092 --> 15:27.258
(screams)

15:27.260 --> 15:29.394
(yells)

15:29.396 --> 15:31.396
She pursued me.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.364
Hey, hey, hey.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.966
What if I was this guy?

15:34.968 --> 15:36.701
Look at me, I'm eating sand.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.871
What would you do?

15:39.873 --> 15:42.040
Uh, what?

15:42.042 --> 15:44.375
Sorry man, my mind
is somewhere else.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.911
Does it have anything to do
with why Fatty Smalls

15:46.913 --> 15:48.680
is staring down
at us and crying?

15:50.049 --> 15:52.283
I should be in there, too.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.818
I'm done playing with you.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.887
Clean up the sandbox
and drive yourself home.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.256
You make me sick.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.891
Mom?

15:59.893 --> 16:00.925
Yes, sweetheart?

16:00.927 --> 16:02.593
(clears throat)

16:02.595 --> 16:05.596
Off-color terms for a
woman's privates include:

16:05.598 --> 16:07.165
(bleep), (bleep),

16:07.167 --> 16:10.501
and most offensively, (bleep).

16:13.605 --> 16:15.907
Hey, man.

16:15.909 --> 16:18.776
I couldn't let you serve
out this sentence alone.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.179
So, is that top bunk taken?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.414
Junior?

16:23.416 --> 16:27.285
You sleep on the floor,
'cause you're my bitch.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.253
Please don't knock
my teeth out.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.822
You're five,
you'll grow more.

16:30.824 --> 16:31.856
Mama!

16:31.858 --> 16:33.024
DONNA:
What?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.526
It was me.
I stole the candy bar.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.962
Junior had nothing
to do with it, I swear.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.430
Please, let him go.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.165
DONNA: Roberta?
ROBERTA: Fine by me.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.701
Thanks, Rallo.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.204
But do let me know
when your teeth fall out.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.739
(giggles)

16:49.308 --> 16:50.675
Walking down the stairs.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.143
Entering the room.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.444
Put all your bits away.

16:53.446 --> 16:57.048
Mom, we have to talk.
About us.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.217
Cleveland, why aren't you
ready for the
New Members Ball?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.219
Because I'm not taking you.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.653
We need some time apart.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.821
What?!

17:03.823 --> 17:05.323
I can't go to the ball alone.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.657
I ain't Sandy Bullocks.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.359
No, I'm not going.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.994
We can't keep
playing this game.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.295
It's not natural.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.165
It was Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Mrs....

17:14.167 --> 17:16.000
Huh, what was
Adam's last name?

17:16.002 --> 17:17.335
They never tell you.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.170
Probably had a
Jewish last name.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.906
(crying)

17:23.042 --> 17:25.977
I'll just steal this suitcase.

17:25.979 --> 17:29.380
("Total Eclipse of the Heart"
intro plays)

17:35.354 --> 17:39.724
(clock cuckoos)

17:39.726 --> 17:41.426
(sighs)

17:41.428 --> 17:44.996

17:44.998 --> 17:46.597

17:50.537 --> 17:53.438

17:53.440 --> 17:54.939
(big bang music playing)

17:54.941 --> 17:58.943
Lordy-Lordy-loo,
I'm very sorry to hear

17:58.945 --> 18:01.946
about Cleveland's
terrible motorcycle death.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.948
But that was Cleveland.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.850
Forever young.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.618
Mom! Mommy!

18:07.620 --> 18:10.021
I'm here. I'm sorry.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.622
Go away, Cleveland, quick.

18:11.624 --> 18:15.460
Now just what in
the heck is going on here?

18:15.462 --> 18:17.795
First you're married,
then you're dead,

18:17.797 --> 18:19.730
and now she's your mom?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.466
(crowd murmuring)

18:21.468 --> 18:23.067
Yes.
(crowd gasps)

18:23.069 --> 18:26.037
Settle down, it's not
what you think.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.406
I mean, have we shared
a bed lately? Sure.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.041
(crowd groans)

18:30.043 --> 18:34.545
Why, you're nothing but
a dirty, rotten mother lover.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.646
It's true.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.582
I love my mom.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.816
And why wouldn't I?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.251
Moms treat us best.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.820
They say we're tall
and handsome,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.890
they touch our socks
when no one else will.

18:45.892 --> 18:50.728
And they save our drawings.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.630
This guy knows what
I'm talking about.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.265
He came with
his mom tonight.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.433
MAN:
That's my wife.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.101
Aah, sick.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.605
My point is, it's
okay to love your mom.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.406
Tell her so, right now.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.243
Come on, take out your phones,
give 'em a call.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.310
MAN:
Our moms are dead.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.578
No heckling.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.113
What do you say,
Neighbors?

19:09.115 --> 19:11.516
Won't you let her
into your stupid club?

19:11.518 --> 19:13.184
Mmm, very well,

19:13.186 --> 19:16.287
if she's willing to pay
the $6,000 initiation fee.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.855
$6,000?!

19:17.857 --> 19:21.125
Cleveland, please pay
the $6,000 initiation fee.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.628
Would you accept an
unintentionally used

19:23.630 --> 19:25.463
and toothy
seamstress mannequin?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.532
Please and yes,
thank you.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.800
Now let's go home, Cleveland.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.135
I'm a potato.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.471
(farting)

19:33.473 --> 19:35.473
Wow, Donna was dead-on.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.108
Oh, my God, Donna.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.709

♪ And I need you now tonight

19:46.118 --> 19:47.818
Dee Dee, where's Donna?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.121
I'm sorry, Donna got tired
of waiting for you.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.823
She's flying to Paris
to start life anew.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.825
Her flight leaves
in 15 minutes.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.394
(takes deep breath)

19:58.630 --> 20:00.498

♪ And I need you now tonight

20:02.001 --> 20:03.501
I picked the wrong night

20:19.017 --> 20:20.651
No, Donna!

20:20.653 --> 20:22.486
My moon and my stars.

20:22.488 --> 20:23.988
DONNA:
Hey, baby.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.357
I couldn't get on
that plane, Cleveland.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.093
I love you too much.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.728
Also, I don't
have a passport.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.930
My mom keeps my
passport for me,

20:32.932 --> 20:35.533
along with the rest of
my important documents.

20:35.535 --> 20:39.070
But as much as I love her,
I can't have sex with her.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.439
Donna, you're my wife.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.175
And there's nothing
I can do about that.

20:44.177 --> 20:46.210
Oh, Cleveland.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.878
So you're done
dating your mom?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.014
Yeah.
Good,

20:50.016 --> 20:51.747
then I won't have to
run off with your dad.
