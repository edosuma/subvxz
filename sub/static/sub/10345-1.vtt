02:02.020 --> 02:02.989
Okay, smile.

02:03.022 --> 02:04.123
Come on.
Let's just go.

02:04.156 --> 02:04.990
I'm sick of taking a pictures.

02:05.023 --> 02:05.624
One more time.

02:05.657 --> 02:07.025
Do you want a picture.

02:07.058 --> 02:07.861
Wait.

02:07.893 --> 02:09.061
Batteries are dead.

02:09.095 --> 02:10.130
No, I just replaced them.

02:18.404 --> 02:21.007
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.108
No, it can't be.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.977
You... you seem way to young.

02:24.010 --> 02:27.647
-You look identical to someone...
-Look, I gotta go.

02:27.679 --> 02:30.883
-Sorry.
-Sure, yeah, sorry.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.945
Yes, we talked about this two
weeks ago. No,

03:31.977 --> 03:33.278
I need an answer
quicker than that.

03:33.311 --> 03:35.047
Hold on.
Hello.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.082
I got to call you back.

03:39.218 --> 03:43.655
I don't care... I don't care
what the Bishop thinks.

03:43.689 --> 03:46.091
Look, father, I'll raise the
money myself in I have to.

03:46.125 --> 03:50.196
I'll rob a bank if necessary.

03:50.228 --> 03:53.499
No, I won't rob a bank.
Joe, wait.

03:53.531 --> 03:55.000
Come here.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.335
What baby?

03:56.369 --> 03:58.137
Those kids are dying
of hunger, father.

03:58.169 --> 04:00.639
They can't wait
for your meeting.

04:00.673 --> 04:01.607
Is this all we've got?

04:01.639 --> 04:02.642
No, we got more.

04:02.674 --> 04:04.076
But not what you wanted.

04:04.109 --> 04:05.978
No, I'm right here.

04:06.012 --> 04:06.513
What point?

04:06.546 --> 04:08.180
What are you doing.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.149
I don't care what
religion those people are.

04:10.181 --> 04:10.683
Those kids are
dying of hunger.

04:10.715 --> 04:11.451
They need food.

04:11.483 --> 04:13.151
Not a cross.

04:13.185 --> 04:15.121
No, no, the point is
we need to help them.

04:15.154 --> 04:16.456
That's the point.

04:16.488 --> 04:17.488
Ok, look.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.558
Have your meeting.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.461
Analyze whatever
you need to analyze.

04:21.493 --> 04:22.294
I'm going forward with
or without your blessing.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.267
We need more shoes.

04:51.089 --> 04:52.257
Hello.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.026
Yeah.

04:54.060 --> 04:55.060
So how much they need?

04:57.829 --> 04:59.298
That's some kind of dough.

06:10.469 --> 06:11.771
Hi, grandpa.

06:11.803 --> 06:12.671
Hi Emmett.

06:12.704 --> 06:14.173
Sorry, I'm late.

06:14.205 --> 06:15.507
-Hello, Dave.
-Hey, pops.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.409
Hey, I got a great
weekend planned.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.043
Ok.

06:17.075 --> 06:18.111
I'll take us to the game.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.278
Ok.

06:19.310 --> 06:20.479
And whatever else
you want to do.

06:20.512 --> 06:22.114
Ok, we'll go to
the batting cages.

06:22.147 --> 06:22.681
Sounds like fun.

06:22.714 --> 06:23.381
Grab your stuff.

06:23.414 --> 06:24.616
Let's go.

06:24.649 --> 06:25.550
Do want to here on Sunday?

06:25.584 --> 06:27.120
-I'll call you.
-Ok.

06:27.152 --> 06:27.819
Have a good weekend, Emmett.

06:27.853 --> 06:28.588
Ok, bye, Dad.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.621
See you.

07:14.332 --> 07:15.400
You looking for me?

07:15.433 --> 07:17.435
Yeah.

07:17.469 --> 07:21.873
I'm sorry... I didn't mean
to... I mean... how you doing?

07:21.906 --> 07:23.476
My name's Jimmy Anderson.

07:23.509 --> 07:26.246
-there's something
I'd like to show you.

07:46.397 --> 07:48.333
Reporter took these photos.

07:48.366 --> 07:52.437
And... that man
saved my life in Vietnam.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.942
But I never found
out who he was.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.911
I mean, he just came out of
the blue and then he just left.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.913
I never saw him again.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.349
He looks identical to you.

08:05.284 --> 08:09.255
-except that he should
be like 40 something now.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.590
I mean, the
resemblance is amazing.

08:10.623 --> 08:11.990
That's what puzzled.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.293
I'm thinking maybe
this is someone

08:14.325 --> 08:16.361
who could have been
related to you?

08:16.394 --> 08:17.897
Why do you want
to find this man?

08:18.663 --> 08:20.265
Why?

08:20.298 --> 08:21.834
Yes.

08:21.866 --> 08:24.736
To find out what his name is.

08:24.769 --> 08:25.471
To thank him.

08:26.538 --> 08:29.475
Buy him a beer.

08:29.507 --> 08:31.276
Well, even if you
never find him,

08:31.310 --> 08:33.546
I'm sure the thought counts.

08:33.578 --> 08:34.647
I got to go.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.280
Sorry.

08:36.315 --> 08:37.650
Look, this is the
closest I've ever gotten

08:37.682 --> 08:40.318
to really finding this man.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.453
I can't help you right now.

08:41.486 --> 08:43.356
Well, that's ok.

08:43.388 --> 08:45.358
I mean, we can meet
tomorrow or some other time.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.325
I just want to pick your brain.

08:47.358 --> 08:48.661
Maybe we can put two
and two together.

08:51.296 --> 08:53.233
I think you're looking
in the wrong places.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.236
What do you mean?

08:57.735 --> 09:00.372
Is the man in the pictures
what you're really looking for?

09:00.406 --> 09:01.774
Of course.

09:01.806 --> 09:02.841
Who else?

09:02.874 --> 09:04.042
I don't know.

09:04.075 --> 09:04.911
That's why I'm asking.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.683
Look, I'm sorry.

09:10.715 --> 09:12.618
I really have to go.

09:12.651 --> 09:14.954
Look, I'd really to have a
talk with you some other time.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.856
Some other time.

09:16.888 --> 09:18.657
Where can I find you?

09:18.690 --> 09:19.791
Around here.

09:19.825 --> 09:21.694
Just ask for me.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.429
Well, what's your name?

10:29.762 --> 10:31.796
Hey, Joe.

10:31.829 --> 10:35.368
Father, I'm going
to go home now.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.635
There are still some people
over there in the church.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.503
So I didn't lock it.

10:38.536 --> 10:40.506
Anything else you
need before I go?

10:40.539 --> 10:41.507
No thanks.

10:41.540 --> 10:42.541
Ok.

10:42.574 --> 10:43.709
Good night.

10:43.742 --> 10:44.743
Good night.

10:49.714 --> 10:50.983
Why did you hide?

10:51.983 --> 10:53.118
I don't know.

10:54.853 --> 10:55.854
It was a reaction.

11:18.142 --> 11:18.911
Catherine, look at me.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.385
No.

11:26.785 --> 11:27.286
No what?

11:29.921 --> 11:30.922
What you're thinking.

11:33.224 --> 11:34.026
What I'm thinking.

11:40.065 --> 11:41.133
You have a husband,
and I have a church.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.185
It's your husband.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.520
What is he doing here?

12:01.719 --> 12:02.954
I do want to see him.

12:03.988 --> 12:05.023
But I have to answer the door.

12:06.190 --> 12:07.593
I can't see right now.

12:07.626 --> 12:08.161
I just can't.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.943
May I help you?

12:23.975 --> 12:25.710
Father Michael,
I guess you remember me.

12:25.743 --> 12:27.213
I'm Catherine's husband.

12:28.113 --> 12:29.915
Yes, of course.

12:29.948 --> 12:30.950
I'll never forget
anybody I marry.

12:34.652 --> 12:35.620
I'd like to have
a talk with you.

12:39.657 --> 12:40.892
I'm in the middle of
something right now.

12:40.925 --> 12:41.927
Can you come back tomorrow?

12:44.629 --> 12:45.930
Tomorrow's going
to be difficult.

12:45.964 --> 12:46.898
I only need a few minutes.

12:52.704 --> 12:53.506
Ok.

12:53.872 --> 12:55.141
Come in.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.044
Thanks.

12:59.744 --> 13:01.147
I normally don't smoke.

13:03.114 --> 13:05.517
You're probably surprised
to see me, father.

13:09.086 --> 13:12.257
I think my wife
is seeing someone.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.761
What makes you think that?

13:15.794 --> 13:18.631
I... I can't pinpoint it.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.900
I don't
have any proof.

13:20.932 --> 13:21.600
It's a gut feeling.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.606
I hardly ever see her
anymore.

13:29.741 --> 13:31.577
Well, you can't just
go on gut feeling alone.

13:33.011 --> 13:34.213
You can tell those things.

13:34.246 --> 13:37.683
The way she dresses.

13:37.715 --> 13:40.084
It's the way she looks at me.

13:40.118 --> 13:42.555
It's not one specific thing.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.625
It's just a combination
of a lot of little things.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.263
I try talking to her.

13:52.296 --> 13:54.332
How do you talk
about these things.

13:54.366 --> 13:55.234
It's difficult.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.411
So how can I help you?

14:09.281 --> 14:11.215
I figured if she were
to have told anyone,

14:11.248 --> 14:13.552
she would have told
you during confession.

14:15.186 --> 14:16.821
Confessions are confidential.

14:16.854 --> 14:18.856
You know, I was

14:18.890 --> 14:20.693
hoping you could help me out.

14:20.725 --> 14:22.293
Maybe you noticed something
or she said something.

14:22.326 --> 14:24.563
I mean, we've got a kid.

14:26.263 --> 14:29.000
I'm just trying to
keep it together.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.072
My god.

14:33.104 --> 14:34.138
What's going on here?

14:34.171 --> 14:34.906
It's not what you think.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.308
I swear.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.942
No, no, no,
we'll just all sit down.

14:37.975 --> 14:38.643
We'll work...

14:38.676 --> 14:39.777
You son of...

14:39.810 --> 14:40.278
No.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.714
Father.

14:44.815 --> 14:46.051
Father, I'm so sorry.

14:53.724 --> 14:54.926
No, don't shoot.

14:54.959 --> 14:55.961
Shut up!

15:05.103 --> 15:05.905
Daddy, no.

15:07.805 --> 15:10.343
Just give me the gun,
nothing happened between us.

15:11.142 --> 15:12.677
Just give me your gun.

15:15.946 --> 15:17.682
How could you do this?

15:35.032 --> 15:36.034
Happy birthday.

17:56.007 --> 17:57.575
Hello, may I help you?

17:57.609 --> 17:59.411
Yeah, I need a room.

17:59.443 --> 18:00.845
For how many night?

18:02.113 --> 18:02.914
I don't know.

18:27.939 --> 18:30.275
It's a tall guy, blond hair.

18:30.307 --> 18:32.109
He told me I could
find him here.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.046
I have a picture right here.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.383
That's the man I'm looking
for.

18:38.650 --> 18:39.852
Look I don't think I know
him.

18:39.884 --> 18:40.652
Ok?

18:40.686 --> 18:44.156
He was here a
couple nights ago.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.623
Look Father Michael
might know him.

18:45.657 --> 18:46.959
But he's saying mass right
now.

18:46.991 --> 18:48.026
I don't know him.

18:48.058 --> 18:49.360
Yeah, I think he must.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.430
Let me give you my address.

18:52.463 --> 18:53.331
Just ask the priest
to give it to him, ok?

18:59.036 --> 19:00.038
Thanks.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.383
last night if you
saw bright lights,

19:12.417 --> 19:14.920
unusual colors, and
odd shapes flying

19:14.952 --> 19:17.455
over the Phoenix sky,
you weren't the only one.

19:17.488 --> 19:18.457
Now what that something
was is in question.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.313
Yes?

20:48.345 --> 20:50.414
Sorry, to bother you, Father.

20:50.448 --> 20:53.451
But they've been trying to
get you from the office.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.154
Your phone seems
to be off the hook.

20:56.187 --> 20:58.490
What time is it?

20:58.523 --> 20:59.391
It's 2 in the afternoon.

21:07.097 --> 21:08.099
That looks good.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.109
I'll tell you, everything that
I've seen so far looks great.

21:17.142 --> 21:19.111
I'm going through your chart.

21:19.143 --> 21:20.045
I've looked at your labs.

21:20.077 --> 21:22.613
I've looked at your x-rays.

21:22.646 --> 21:24.482
All your results turned
out to be normal.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.450
Physically I think
you're in great shape.

21:26.484 --> 21:28.353
But this time I think we need
to take it a step further

21:28.385 --> 21:31.355
and get a psychological
evaluation.

21:31.389 --> 21:32.623
What are you suggesting?

21:32.657 --> 21:33.358
Is something mental...

21:33.391 --> 21:34.659
No, I'm not saying it's mental.

21:34.691 --> 21:36.428
What I'm saying at
this point we need

21:36.460 --> 21:39.296
to have you see a
psychiatrist to evaluate

21:39.330 --> 21:40.499
the other aspects so I can
put all this stuff together.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.161
I saw a
dream, which made me afraid.

22:44.661 --> 22:47.699
And the thoughts upon my bed
and the visions of my head

22:47.731 --> 22:48.733
trouble me.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.438
Visions of my head trouble
me.

22:54.205 --> 22:55.340
Visions of my head trouble
me.

22:57.741 --> 22:59.110
Daniel 4:5.

23:00.577 --> 23:03.114
Daniel 4:5.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.283
4, 5, 4, 5.

23:08.286 --> 23:09.188
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

23:17.161 --> 23:20.565
I saw a dream, which
made me afraid.

23:20.597 --> 23:23.434
And the thoughts upon my bed and
the visions of my head trouble me.

23:24.536 --> 23:25.536
Daniel.

23:49.259 --> 23:50.295
Hi.

23:52.529 --> 23:54.365
I think someone was
looking for you.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.169
He showed me some pictures.

23:57.201 --> 23:59.203
And I think it's you.

24:01.639 --> 24:03.275
Anyway, he told me to
give you this address.

24:04.441 --> 24:05.443
Ok.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.485
He didn't have blue eyes.

24:55.392 --> 24:56.260
Why are you crying?

24:57.795 --> 25:00.399
Because I don't like math.

25:02.499 --> 25:04.202
Math.

25:06.504 --> 25:07.472
I'll tell you a secret.

25:09.373 --> 25:10.942
I have a PhD in chemistry, and
I still count on my fingers.

25:12.376 --> 25:13.945
But I don't want to be a PhD.

25:15.880 --> 25:16.815
What do you want to be?

25:16.847 --> 25:17.515
A chef.

25:18.882 --> 25:19.617
I see.

25:20.884 --> 25:22.386
Why aren't you at work?

25:22.420 --> 25:23.322
My daddy's at work right now.

25:27.592 --> 25:32.264
Well, about a year ago on
a very beautiful spring day

25:32.296 --> 25:34.598
I was going to work just
like every other day.

25:34.632 --> 25:38.737
And I thought what
if I just kept going.

25:38.769 --> 25:40.537
So I took off my tie.

25:40.571 --> 25:43.475
And I just drove
and drove and drove.

25:44.808 --> 25:46.677
Did your boss get mad at you?

25:46.710 --> 25:47.178
No.

25:48.313 --> 25:49.480
Well, a little bit.

25:51.415 --> 25:53.517
George, it's me,
Jimmy.

25:54.919 --> 25:57.389
I'm far, real far.

25:59.324 --> 26:02.260
Well, but I quit.

26:04.094 --> 26:05.596
No, I'm not kidding.

26:06.863 --> 26:08.365
What family?

26:08.399 --> 26:09.267
I have no family.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.469
Actually you gave me an idea.

26:12.503 --> 26:14.472
I should start one now that
I'm divorcing the company.

26:14.505 --> 26:15.507
Crazy?

26:17.441 --> 26:18.942
Well, you know,
sometimes you just

26:18.976 --> 26:20.312
have to do what
you really want.

26:22.046 --> 26:23.282
So long, George.

26:32.523 --> 26:35.427
My daddy doesn't like his
boss.

26:35.459 --> 26:36.961
Maybe I should tell him
to do the same thing.

26:38.696 --> 26:39.698
Come on, let's go.

27:46.497 --> 27:48.400
Father
Daniel, good to see you.

27:48.432 --> 27:49.600
Long way, Michael.

27:49.633 --> 27:50.735
You made it.

27:50.767 --> 27:51.736
It
was a good drive.

27:51.768 --> 27:52.871
It was good.

27:52.903 --> 27:55.038
Just a little hard to find.

27:55.072 --> 27:57.941
Finding
me can be difficult.

27:57.975 --> 27:58.910
I'm happy you're here,
Michael.

28:05.115 --> 28:06.117
Have a seat.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.656
Father, the
reason I came here today

28:11.689 --> 28:13.458
is because I want
to talk to you...

28:13.490 --> 28:14.992
I haven't
been a priest for what?

28:15.026 --> 28:16.527
10 years.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.530
You don't need to
call me father.

28:18.563 --> 28:23.001
Well, a priest is
always a priest.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.536
You sounded preoccupied
on the phone.

28:26.903 --> 28:27.905
What's going on?

28:31.776 --> 28:34.612
About a year ago or so I
started to get these headaches.

28:34.644 --> 28:37.014
At the beginning I
thought it was stress.

28:37.047 --> 28:38.048
Didn't think much of it.

28:41.751 --> 28:43.954
But after a while they became
more intense, more painful.

28:48.226 --> 28:53.598
And lately, I started
to hear sounds.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.437
What kind of sounds?

28:59.536 --> 29:01.539
They're not sounds
that I can identify.

29:02.507 --> 29:05.109
They're not voices either.

29:05.142 --> 29:06.010
They're sounds that
I've never heard before.

29:10.046 --> 29:11.048
I want to show you something.

29:17.153 --> 29:21.659
A couple of days ago somebody
left this in my house.

29:21.691 --> 29:22.594
I don't know how or why.

29:38.174 --> 29:40.844
Do you know what this is?

29:40.878 --> 29:41.880
It's an Egyptian cross.

29:47.785 --> 29:49.586
It's called Ankh.

29:49.620 --> 29:53.725
It represents the key
to hidden mysteries,

29:53.757 --> 29:57.528
a key to the kingdom of
the dead and eternal life.

30:01.932 --> 30:04.068
I had seven dreams where I see
that across again and again.

30:05.603 --> 30:07.538
I remember each
one, seven times.

30:09.574 --> 30:11.642
Does anyone else know
about all of this?

30:11.676 --> 30:12.677
No.

30:14.578 --> 30:15.980
I saw a doctor, but I didn't
tell him I hear things.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.093
You said you found it
a couple of nights ago.

30:31.728 --> 30:34.731
It was March 13.

30:34.765 --> 30:36.200
That's right.

30:36.232 --> 30:37.101
Your birthday.

30:39.870 --> 30:41.606
You remember my birthday.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.074
I remember a lot of
people's birthdays.

30:49.246 --> 30:51.016
What's your gut
feeling telling you?

30:52.850 --> 30:54.019
What do you think is happening?

31:00.157 --> 31:02.060
If someone was telling
me something like this,

31:02.093 --> 31:03.995
I would think that person
is delusional,

31:04.929 --> 31:05.930
maybe schizophrenic.

31:08.298 --> 31:09.334
Do I think I'm crazy?

31:10.634 --> 31:11.635
No.

31:12.670 --> 31:13.337
Normal?

31:14.805 --> 31:15.739
What's normal?

31:17.674 --> 31:19.176
How can I rationally
explain this drawing

31:19.209 --> 31:20.679
that appears in my dreams.

31:22.712 --> 31:23.614
How can anyone know
what's inside my head?

31:26.417 --> 31:27.352
It's just not real.

31:30.086 --> 31:32.156
Do you know I was an
atheist when I was younger?

31:34.190 --> 31:35.192
No.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.930
I'll believe it when
I see it was my motto.

31:40.965 --> 31:42.667
Basically, I didn't
believe in anything.

31:43.834 --> 31:44.835
What changed you?

31:46.170 --> 31:47.305
I became curious.

31:49.774 --> 31:53.378
Our eyes are great to read a
book or drive, watch a movie.

31:55.278 --> 31:57.981
But can we really
trust our senses

31:58.015 --> 31:59.950
to determine what's real
and what's not.

32:02.186 --> 32:06.291
For instance,
radio waves, frequencies,

32:08.325 --> 32:10.260
we can't see them
or touch them.

32:10.294 --> 32:12.063
But they're here.

32:13.797 --> 32:16.233
What else is around
us that we can't see.

32:23.740 --> 32:24.742
Lucia.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.113
Lucia.

32:30.113 --> 32:31.848
Lucia.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.810
'Why did you come to me?

33:00.443 --> 33:01.945
I haven't seen you for years.

33:04.448 --> 33:05.917
You spent your life
researching miracles.

33:08.285 --> 33:09.853
And you were involved
in exorcisms.

33:09.886 --> 33:12.823
Plus, you've been my mentor.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.259
Who else can I trust?

33:17.061 --> 33:18.029
No that's not it.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.064
There's something else.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.102
I was reading a
passage in the Bible.

33:27.103 --> 33:29.740
And your name
appeared before me.

33:32.843 --> 33:34.845
When was the last time
you had this experience?

33:36.180 --> 33:37.181
Last night.

33:39.883 --> 33:41.219
Does it come slowly?

33:43.120 --> 33:45.022
Do you get any warning
before it happens?

33:45.055 --> 33:46.391
No, it just happens
without any warning.

33:50.527 --> 33:51.362
The drawing is the clue.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.238
Someone is trying to
make contact with you.

34:07.411 --> 34:08.913
You're not suggesting
I'm possessed by...

34:08.946 --> 34:09.447
A demon?

34:10.947 --> 34:11.915
No, no, no, no.

34:13.984 --> 34:15.018
This is not about exorcism.

34:18.054 --> 34:19.056
This is different.

34:22.192 --> 34:23.092
Can you spend the night here?

34:26.496 --> 34:27.498
Yes.

34:29.098 --> 34:30.100
I can.

34:34.605 --> 34:36.541
I guess
I can show you this now.

35:02.632 --> 35:04.035
Right here, Michael.

35:26.924 --> 35:29.126
Now, who could that be?

35:29.158 --> 35:30.160
Excuse me.

35:51.214 --> 35:53.884
It's my neighbor from
across the street.

35:53.917 --> 35:57.220
I need to move my car.

35:57.254 --> 35:57.989
I'll be right back.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.296
He's in a coma.

37:12.328 --> 37:13.997
When
is he going to recover?

37:14.031 --> 37:16.100
It's to early to
tell.

37:16.132 --> 37:16.935
I'm sorry.

38:15.158 --> 38:18.429
Someone is trying to
make contact with you.

38:22.232 --> 38:25.169
The drawing is the clue.

38:25.201 --> 38:27.203
Why did you come to me?

38:27.236 --> 38:30.040
I haven't seen for years.

47:48.098 --> 47:48.899
115.

47:51.835 --> 47:53.704
115.

47:53.736 --> 47:55.171
115.

47:57.774 --> 47:59.810
11.

47:59.843 --> 48:02.712
A. A 115.

48:04.314 --> 48:07.350
A 115 A. Bible.

48:08.685 --> 48:09.652
Bible.

48:09.685 --> 48:10.821
Bible.

48:10.853 --> 48:11.855
Bible.

48:14.757 --> 48:16.593
A. A. A. Acts.

48:18.761 --> 48:21.765
115.

48:21.797 --> 48:23.933
I was in the city
of Joppa praying.

48:23.966 --> 48:26.402
And in a trance I saw a
vision.

48:26.435 --> 48:30.640
A certain vessel descend...
a vessel, a certain vessel

48:30.674 --> 48:34.411
descend as it had been
a great sheet let down

48:34.444 --> 48:35.646
by heaven by four corners.

48:36.647 --> 48:40.683
And it came even to me...
even to me... even to me.

48:50.225 --> 48:53.329
Whether it's true
or not, it's not the issue.

48:53.363 --> 48:56.198
The rumor of the affair with
a married woman is very real.

48:56.232 --> 48:57.901
It's the rumor that's
the problem, Father.

48:57.933 --> 48:59.035
Not truth or lies.

49:00.703 --> 49:04.207
People ask questions and
wonder and the rumor grows.

49:04.239 --> 49:06.343
And this is hurting our
church.

49:06.375 --> 49:07.377
Think about it.

49:08.777 --> 49:11.314
Another city, a new start.

49:13.382 --> 49:15.352
I think that would be
a good way, we think,

49:15.384 --> 49:16.252
to kill the rumor.

49:17.486 --> 49:18.154
God bless you, Father.

49:27.964 --> 49:29.766
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy spirit.

49:29.799 --> 49:31.701
Amen.

49:31.734 --> 49:32.736
Go ahead.

49:35.437 --> 49:37.973
Do You ever
wonder what you looked

49:38.006 --> 49:39.709
like before you were born?

49:41.910 --> 49:43.346
I don't expect an
answer, Father.

49:44.980 --> 49:45.948
Something to think about.

49:47.517 --> 49:52.221
If I told you, what
would be the point?

49:56.926 --> 50:01.297
If I interfere, what
would the consequences be.

50:02.899 --> 50:03.767
If you interfere what?

50:05.968 --> 50:06.969
I do forgive you.

50:23.018 --> 50:24.053
Wait.

52:17.933 --> 52:18.935
Who's there?

55:45.741 --> 55:47.511
Joe, what is it?

55:57.185 --> 55:59.155
Father, this is blood?

56:27.183 --> 56:28.785
Have You told anybody
else about this?

56:28.817 --> 56:29.819
No.

56:31.319 --> 56:33.122
Don't you think we
should call the police?

56:33.156 --> 56:35.158
The police?

56:35.190 --> 56:38.261
We could call the police.

56:38.294 --> 56:41.163
Along with the police, the media
will come... meaning publicity,

56:43.332 --> 56:44.100
most likely bad publicity.

56:48.236 --> 56:51.807
On the other hand, we're
responsible for many people

56:51.841 --> 56:54.210
that count on us.

56:54.243 --> 56:56.411
So we have to put
everything on a scale.

56:56.444 --> 56:58.147
We have to figure out
which decision affects

56:58.181 --> 56:58.882
the least number of people.

57:05.855 --> 57:07.790
That's the question, Joe.

57:33.748 --> 57:36.520
If I interfere, what
would the consequences be?

57:39.355 --> 57:41.858
Something to think about.

57:41.890 --> 57:42.658
But I do forgive you.

57:49.265 --> 57:52.302
We've been getting complaints
from some of your parishioners.

57:52.335 --> 57:53.270
Are you aware of that?

57:59.709 --> 58:06.381
The bishop is not happy with
your approach, your...

58:06.415 --> 58:07.784
what's the word?

58:07.817 --> 58:09.919
Unorthodox.

58:09.951 --> 58:16.392
Unorthodox, your unorthodox
approach to the priesthood.

58:16.424 --> 58:20.796
And we've had this conversation,
several times, Father Michael.

58:20.830 --> 58:23.433
And yet, you seem to insist
on going you way rather

58:23.466 --> 58:24.866
than the church's way.

58:29.272 --> 58:29.973
Aren't you going
to say anything?

58:33.308 --> 58:34.977
Father?

58:45.620 --> 58:46.689
Father.

58:46.721 --> 58:47.489
Father.

59:46.515 --> 59:47.317
Michael.

59:59.462 --> 01:00:04.334
If you went to solve the mystery
of your thoughts, you

01:00:04.366 --> 01:00:07.002
have to look into
the scriptures.

01:00:07.035 --> 01:00:11.440
You have to look into scripture
that predate the Bible.

01:00:11.473 --> 01:00:13.575
Today, we call them aliens.

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:17.680
You know, 2,000... 3,000 years
ago, they call them angels.

01:00:17.712 --> 01:00:19.448
One of the things
that we have found

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:22.418
is that along with
the sightings,

01:00:22.451 --> 01:00:26.489
there is an encounter
with someone that appears

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.391
to be human, normal person.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.926
Sometimes it's a man.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.560
Sometimes it's a woman.

01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:32.394
But there's always
an encounter.

01:00:53.915 --> 01:00:55.417
You made it.

01:00:57.886 --> 01:00:59.421
Why did you come to Phoenix?

01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:01.991
I'm just passing through.

01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:06.395
Maybe I'll go north or south
or just flip a coin before I go.

01:01:06.428 --> 01:01:08.397
That's how I like to travel.

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.367
I still don't know
what I can do for you?

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.471
I understand that some
people may look alike.

01:01:16.471 --> 01:01:18.440
But for many years, I have
been having this feeling

01:01:18.473 --> 01:01:21.477
that someone follows me.

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:23.178
And then I have these dreams
where the person who follows me

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.480
tells me something.

01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:26.982
I can never recall
what he says.

01:01:27.015 --> 01:01:29.051
But I remember his face.

01:01:30.886 --> 01:01:32.455
It's the soldiers face.

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.457
It's... it's your face.

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:41.564
I thought maybe...
you probably think I'm nuts.

01:01:41.596 --> 01:01:44.466
I don't know why I
asked you to come.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.436
I guess I was looking
for... I don't know.

01:01:49.904 --> 01:01:51.440
A miracle.

01:01:56.578 --> 01:01:57.413
Maybe this is just
a waste of time.

01:01:59.848 --> 01:02:00.517
Maybe not.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.638
Are you oke?

01:02:23.672 --> 01:02:25.174
You look like you're in pain.

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:25.975
I'm fine.

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:27.643
Don't worry.

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:28.611
So where are we going?

01:02:29.978 --> 01:02:30.647
Let's just go for a ride.

01:04:52.087 --> 01:04:53.355
Hello.

01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:55.024
Yes.

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:58.160
Father, I just wanted
to apologize.

01:05:00.294 --> 01:05:03.131
I don't know what came
over me that night.

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.034
I just... I'm very sorry.

01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:07.937
That's Ok, Dave.

01:05:07.969 --> 01:05:10.006
I've already forgiven you.

01:05:11.739 --> 01:05:15.810
Father, that night, before
I came to your house,

01:05:15.843 --> 01:05:21.282
something crazy... before
I came to your house,

01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:22.183
I saw those lights.

01:05:22.216 --> 01:05:24.653
They flew right over me.

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:25.421
What lights?

01:05:25.453 --> 01:05:26.921
What are you talking about?

01:05:26.955 --> 01:05:29.091
Lights, they flew over Phoenix.

01:05:29.123 --> 01:05:30.959
It's been in the news,
the papers everywhere.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.663
I guess I haven't
been paying attention.

01:05:36.397 --> 01:05:40.035
I haven't told this
to anyone, but...

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.138
There was something
about those lights.

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.841
It's just nuts, Father,
But I felt strange.

01:05:45.873 --> 01:05:48.743
Felt I needed to
go to your house.

01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:27.050
Ok, stop right here.

01:06:39.127 --> 01:06:41.129
What do you see there?

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.270
What do you see?

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:50.940
I don't see anything.

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:51.974
Am I supposed to
look for something?

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:55.578
The right path.

01:06:59.448 --> 01:07:01.084
The right path to what?

01:07:02.884 --> 01:07:04.087
Whatever it is
you're looking for.

01:07:06.788 --> 01:07:08.024
What are you talking about?

01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:10.960
You have two choices, Jimmy.

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:14.864
You can take the
path to the left.

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:17.867
Or you can take the
path to the right.

01:07:21.969 --> 01:07:24.105
Either way, you're going to
end up someplace different.

01:07:24.138 --> 01:07:25.974
What?

01:07:26.007 --> 01:07:26.942
Left or right, Jimmy.

01:07:30.511 --> 01:07:32.515
You're not really
serious, are you?

01:07:32.547 --> 01:07:33.750
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:07:39.053 --> 01:07:41.089
Ok, I don't what kind of
game this is, but I'll play.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.763
Left... that's the
road I'm taking.

01:07:53.067 --> 01:07:54.069
Where you going?

01:07:59.908 --> 01:08:01.343
I'm leaving, Jimmy.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.812
We're in the middle of
nowhere.

01:08:02.844 --> 01:08:03.879
What do you mean
you're leaving?

01:08:03.911 --> 01:08:04.913
Jump in.

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:11.954
Wait.

01:08:15.022 --> 01:08:15.924
Wait.

01:08:17.392 --> 01:08:18.394
Wait.

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:22.363
Wait, wait, what are
you nuts or something.

01:08:22.397 --> 01:08:25.100
Let's go grab a six pack and
forget about all this crazy stuff.

01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:28.171
Let me see that coin.

01:08:36.044 --> 01:08:37.446
Now listen to me, Jimmy.

01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:40.849
What you see there is
not a fork in the road.

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:43.819
That's the rest of your life.

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:48.357
What are you saying?

01:08:48.389 --> 01:08:49.357
Don't leave it to chance, Jimmy.

01:08:51.059 --> 01:08:53.095
You need to trust your
instincts on this one,

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:55.363
because this is not
your second chance.

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:58.968
It's your last.

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:00.236
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.104
Time out.

01:09:02.136 --> 01:09:04.005
What's going on here?

01:09:04.037 --> 01:09:04.840
Who the hell are you, man?

01:09:08.443 --> 01:09:09.979
Let the past be the past, Jimmy.

01:09:11.446 --> 01:09:13.381
Go and make your decision.

01:12:16.864 --> 01:12:19.134
No, no, stop it.

01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:20.201
No?

01:12:20.234 --> 01:12:21.170
Stop.

01:12:21.202 --> 01:12:23.171
No is not an answer.

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:24.372
I can't spend the
afternoon with you.

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:27.109
I have to go back to work.

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.743
We don't spend
any time together.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:31.113
10 years of hell, now you
want to spend time together.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.116
Where are you going?

01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:36.818
Nowhere.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:37.653
Just please take me back.

01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:03.178
See, I used to work
for a big oil company.

01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:05.447
But one day I just quit.

01:13:05.479 --> 01:13:07.315
I had an idea for
an alternative fuel.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.218
And you could make
in your own backyard

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.386
out of practically anything.

01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:14.156
They didn't like that.

01:13:14.188 --> 01:13:15.556
I'm actually still
working on it.

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:16.392
I'm so close.

01:13:20.261 --> 01:13:21.729
Sometimes I think
it's just a dream.

01:13:22.697 --> 01:13:23.398
Are you drunk?

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.233
Are you drunk?
You're drunk.

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.768
Let's go.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.868
You could have killed me.

01:13:27.902 --> 01:13:29.238
-It was an accident.
-You could have killed me.

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:30.238
Back off.

01:13:30.272 --> 01:13:31.172
He's nothing.

01:13:31.206 --> 01:13:31.773
He's drunk.

01:13:31.805 --> 01:13:33.142
He's nothing.

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:34.176
Please, let's just go.

01:13:34.209 --> 01:13:35.077
He could have killed me.

01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:36.178
It was an accident.
Nothing happened.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.312
Why are you defending him?

01:13:37.345 --> 01:13:37.779
Defend me.

01:13:37.812 --> 01:13:38.514
Let's go.

01:13:38.546 --> 01:13:39.413
Defend me.

01:13:39.447 --> 01:13:40.849
You're acting irrational.

01:13:40.881 --> 01:13:41.884
Defend me.

01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:20.354
Stop.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:59.328
-Jimmy?
-Sabrina?

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.429
How long has it been?

01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:04.800
25 years.

01:15:12.806 --> 01:15:15.243
You know, I've never
stopped looking for you.

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:36.558
Dad, are you sleeping?

01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:37.593
No.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.363
Mom, no, nothing.

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:43.332
I didn't realize
how late it was.

01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:49.971
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:50.004 --> 01:16:51.907
I'm coming to visit soon,
Mom.

01:16:53.974 --> 01:16:55.044
I miss you too.

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:05.687
Her son has disappeared.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.723
The police have been looking
for him since last night.

01:17:07.755 --> 01:17:09.357
They... they don't know
what happened yet.

01:17:11.492 --> 01:17:14.095
I... I don't know
what we can do.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.743
Feathers, feathers, circles,

01:18:02.777 --> 01:18:04.413
desert, the desert.

01:18:05.179 --> 01:18:07.114
No, no, no.

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.417
Sky, desert clouds.

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:12.187
Feathers, feathers, feathers.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.889
Wire fence, fence, fence.

01:18:14.822 --> 01:18:15.823
Wire fence.

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.126
Feathers, feathers. feathers.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.504
Feathers with triangles,
triangles.

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:31.172
See the triangles.

01:19:11.612 --> 01:19:13.781
The doctor said that
you're ready to go home.

01:19:13.814 --> 01:19:16.518
And we're going to go
ahead and send your results

01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:19.587
to your primary care physician.

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.156
Tomorrow you're going to
need to give them a call...

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:13.735
I'm going mad.

01:24:21.988 --> 01:24:25.794
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.305
You ever wonder what you looked
like before you were born?

01:24:39.372 --> 01:24:44.011
If I told you, what
would be the point?

01:25:18.545 --> 01:25:21.415
So you had a vision
of where the kid was.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:23.984
That's the truth.

01:25:25.886 --> 01:25:28.889
We feel it's in
the best interests

01:25:28.922 --> 01:25:32.861
of the church and yourself
if you took some time off...

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.998
a year, maybe two.

01:25:40.067 --> 01:25:42.537
There's a mission in Chicago
that could use your help.

01:25:45.072 --> 01:25:47.208
Why Chicago?

01:25:47.241 --> 01:25:48.343
Because it's cold.

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.246
Cold weather's
good for thinking.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:57.218
It's just a matter of
time until someone...

01:25:57.251 --> 01:25:59.921
because there's
always someone... who

01:25:59.953 --> 01:26:02.776
will suggest that maybe
you had something

01:26:02.777 --> 01:26:04.658
to do with the
kid's disappearance.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.995
I mean, there are
already rumors...

01:26:12.065 --> 01:26:17.339
There are already rumors that
you are a psychic or a medium.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.475
Or a charlatan.

01:26:22.242 --> 01:26:25.045
Let's see if we
understand each other,

01:26:25.078 --> 01:26:28.483
you have become a
liability to the church.

01:28:54.127 --> 01:28:55.130
Lucia.

01:31:57.044 --> 01:32:00.982
Father, father, are you
there?

01:32:20.466 --> 01:32:22.303
Father, father.

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:25.406
Dad, come to me.

01:32:25.438 --> 01:32:27.407
Mommy, are
you hiding from me?

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:41.822
Am not sure, is this real?

01:32:41.854 --> 01:32:42.989
What is it.

01:32:43.023 --> 01:32:44.558
Daddy, mommy.

01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:46.426
Father, mother.

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:48.562
Where are
you hiding from me?

01:32:48.595 --> 01:32:49.597
Why do you hide from me?

01:32:53.533 --> 01:32:54.969
Is this real?

01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:56.270
Real?

01:32:57.904 --> 01:32:58.773
What do you mean,
what do I want?

01:32:58.805 --> 01:32:59.706
Is this real?

01:32:59.739 --> 01:33:00.742
Fine.

01:33:01.507 --> 01:33:02.343
I'm not sure now.

01:33:02.376 --> 01:33:03.611
What am I supposed to do.

01:33:08.748 --> 01:33:09.584
I can see.

01:33:10.983 --> 01:33:12.352
I can see.

01:33:14.888 --> 01:33:16.024
I can feel it.

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:19.827
I remember it.

01:33:19.859 --> 01:33:21.996
I remember the road.

01:33:24.063 --> 01:33:25.098
I was here.

01:33:25.131 --> 01:33:26.033
I was here.

01:33:30.737 --> 01:33:31.938
I remember this road.

01:33:31.971 --> 01:33:33.573
I was right here.

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:36.344
Are you there.
I was here.

01:33:36.376 --> 01:33:39.379
I remember.
Something happened.

01:33:52.559 --> 01:33:54.662
Where are you, mommy?

01:33:54.694 --> 01:33:55.362
Waiting for you.

01:34:02.836 --> 01:34:09.444
Yo, hey, mister, are you...

01:34:32.599 --> 01:34:34.001
Yeah, hi.

01:34:34.033 --> 01:34:35.568
Got a problem.

01:34:35.602 --> 01:34:36.537
I found guy in a car.

01:34:36.569 --> 01:34:37.404
He's not breathing.

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:38.572
I think he's dead.

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.455
Look deep inside yourself.

01:34:54.487 --> 01:34:55.622
Seek.

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:56.756
Ask questions.

01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:57.658
Go deeper.

01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:58.492
Go deeper.

01:35:00.059 --> 01:35:01.062
Keep going.

01:35:03.897 --> 01:35:04.899
Don't be afraid.

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:11.605
Your fear.

01:35:11.638 --> 01:35:12.407
Face your fear.

01:35:18.144 --> 01:35:19.879
Go beyond your fear.

01:35:19.912 --> 01:35:22.916
Go beyond your fear.

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:23.951
Keep going.

01:35:30.157 --> 01:35:32.126
Look beyond them, Micheal.

01:35:32.158 --> 01:35:33.594
Beyond them.

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:36.029
Don't give up now.

01:35:37.197 --> 01:35:38.032
Past them.

01:35:38.064 --> 01:35:39.065
Past them.

01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:51.812
Look beyond that, Michael.

01:35:51.845 --> 01:35:53.814
Beyond that.

01:35:53.846 --> 01:35:55.616
Deeper, Michael.

01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:58.052
It's more.

01:35:58.585 --> 01:35:59.487
It's more.

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:02.223
Don't look there.

01:36:03.256 --> 01:36:03.991
Keep going.

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:10.931
Deeper, Michael.

01:36:14.166 --> 01:36:15.602
Don't give up now.

01:36:21.875 --> 01:36:22.944
Follow me.

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:25.212
Don't be afraid, Michael.

01:36:36.089 --> 01:36:37.558
You are here, Michael.

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:40.627
Good.

01:36:40.661 --> 01:36:41.562
Keep going.

01:36:42.729 --> 01:36:43.965
Go in, Michael.

01:36:59.078 --> 01:36:59.947
What do you see?

01:37:05.285 --> 01:37:06.254
What do you see, Michael?

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:12.994
What do you see?

01:37:17.197 --> 01:37:18.966
Let me be inside you.

01:37:22.935 --> 01:37:24.304
Good, good.

01:37:26.105 --> 01:37:27.140
Do you know where you are?

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:30.144
It's 1960.

01:37:31.144 --> 01:37:31.812
It's summer.

01:37:33.947 --> 01:37:35.248
Something happened that summer.

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.619
Something extraordinary.

01:37:40.953 --> 01:37:42.556
It completely changed my life.

01:37:45.224 --> 01:37:47.594
I was sitting at a bench
in a park near my church.

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.565
A stranger came up
and sat next to me.

01:37:53.132 --> 01:37:53.867
I didn't mind.

01:37:55.301 --> 01:37:56.571
I could use someone to talk to.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:05.078
I was drinking back then,
especially that day.

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:09.116
I just gave the funeral
mass of a little girl.

01:38:09.148 --> 01:38:11.250
It's hard when a child dies.

01:38:11.283 --> 01:38:13.853
Hard to understand.

01:38:13.886 --> 01:38:19.693
Everything you say to the parents
sounds so hollow, so empty.

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:24.966
You say she's in a better place.

01:38:26.832 --> 01:38:29.937
But this is the better
place with them.

01:38:32.304 --> 01:38:34.240
Maybe there's no
such thing as death.

01:38:36.742 --> 01:38:39.613
Maybe dying is just getting
up and going into another room.

01:38:42.748 --> 01:38:43.884
You know why I come here?

01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:51.959
This will probably sound silly
to you, but I had a dream.

01:38:53.359 --> 01:38:56.796
I was in a park like this
one.

01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:00.800
Suddenly someone walked up to
me, a young man, 32, no more.

01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:06.939
I couldn't see his
face clearly.

01:39:06.973 --> 01:39:10.377
But he looked like Jesus.

01:39:11.711 --> 01:39:13.680
He felt like Jesus.

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:16.984
He was so vivid, so real.

01:39:19.385 --> 01:39:21.321
Then I woke up.

01:39:23.956 --> 01:39:24.991
I've been coming
here ever since.

01:39:29.895 --> 01:39:31.098
We became friends.

01:39:32.765 --> 01:39:34.367
He visited me several times.

01:39:35.501 --> 01:39:37.071
We talked about everything.

01:39:39.072 --> 01:39:41.976
He was the most brilliant
person I've ever met in my life.

01:39:44.211 --> 01:39:45.446
I was completely intrigued.

01:39:46.912 --> 01:39:48.014
Who was he?

01:39:48.047 --> 01:39:49.082
Where was he from?

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:52.853
I've know you for a while now.

01:39:52.885 --> 01:39:54.020
But I don't know
anything about you.

01:39:55.087 --> 01:39:56.823
Who are you?

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.091
What do you do?

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:02.328
Where are you from?

01:40:05.031 --> 01:40:06.200
Is that important to you?

01:40:07.867 --> 01:40:08.401
To know?

01:40:09.836 --> 01:40:10.838
Yes.

01:40:20.846 --> 01:40:24.917
What I'm going to show you
will be hard to understand.

01:40:24.951 --> 01:40:26.185
Just try to remain calm.

01:40:26.219 --> 01:40:26.921
Don't be afraid.

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:36.395
I can't describe
what happened to me.

01:40:36.429 --> 01:40:37.765
There are no words.

01:40:39.265 --> 01:40:40.800
No way to explain it.

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:43.136
I had a million
questions.

01:40:44.837 --> 01:40:47.207
And then he took me to
the beginning of all.

01:40:49.876 --> 01:40:55.181
He simply said, the seeker
shall not stop until he finds.

01:40:56.983 --> 01:40:59.186
When he finds, he
will become troubled.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.790
When he becomes troubled,
he will be astonished.

01:41:05.591 --> 01:41:08.129
And then he will
reign over all.

01:41:09.929 --> 01:41:11.397
Two days later, he came back.

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:16.203
There's a couple who
goes to your church.

01:41:16.236 --> 01:41:18.538
They just came over from
Italy about a year ago.

01:41:20.907 --> 01:41:23.944
Yes, Antonio and Maria
Corino.

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:27.047
I... I know them well.

01:41:28.982 --> 01:41:31.484
And the wife, she's
having trouble having kids.

01:41:33.385 --> 01:41:34.187
Yes.

01:41:35.455 --> 01:41:37.224
It's been very
painful for them.

01:41:41.294 --> 01:41:42.563
They've tried everything.

01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:46.500
They've seen several doctors.

01:41:51.136 --> 01:41:52.139
There's nothing they could
do.

01:41:55.041 --> 01:41:56.844
She can't have a child.

01:41:58.310 --> 01:42:00.947
She will have a child, a boy.

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:04.552
They'll call him Michael.

01:42:07.019 --> 01:42:07.854
I want you to look after him.

01:42:10.389 --> 01:42:11.457
That's your mission.

01:42:15.228 --> 01:42:19.132
March 13, 1997, the day
of his 36th birthday,

01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.937
he's going to go through
a transformation.

01:42:25.170 --> 01:42:28.107
It will be difficult.
He'll rediscover himself.

01:42:30.542 --> 01:42:33.546
And finally he'll be ready
to take on his mission.

01:42:36.248 --> 01:42:37.350
What am I supposed to do?

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:39.954
Guide him.

01:42:41.153 --> 01:42:41.955
Teach him well.

01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:46.126
A couple of days after
his birthday in '97,

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:50.964
he's going to come to see
you, ask some questions.

01:42:57.537 --> 01:43:01.108
Fate is going to play
some games on both of you.

01:43:09.215 --> 01:43:10.150
Lift your arm.

01:43:12.051 --> 01:43:13.053
I can't.

01:43:15.654 --> 01:43:16.422
It's paralyzed.

01:43:18.524 --> 01:43:19.526
Lift it.

01:43:34.373 --> 01:43:36.609
All faith, he said,

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:40.980
all beliefs are merely
roads that will ultimately

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:42.382
lead to the same conclusion.

01:43:44.651 --> 01:43:48.956
When your faith is not in
men, not in words, miracles

01:43:48.988 --> 01:43:50.656
will happen, he said.

01:43:50.689 --> 01:43:51.491
Healing will happen.

01:44:00.632 --> 01:44:04.004
Go east on Rocks Springs about
the four miles and you'II...

01:44:04.037 --> 01:44:05.072
I'm ok.

01:44:05.104 --> 01:44:06.105
Thank you.

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.515
Don't ask me what happened.

01:44:15.547 --> 01:44:18.085
This guy's out of his car
and just walked over to me.

01:44:18.117 --> 01:44:19.118
He seems to be ok.

01:44:20.019 --> 01:44:21.020
I don't have a clue.

01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:27.126
He visited me seven more times
during a period of three years.

01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:34.134
Everything you'll find in this
box is about what he revealed.

01:44:37.569 --> 01:44:41.440
You have been chosen
to help to prepare

01:44:41.474 --> 01:44:43.444
the way for what's coming.

01:44:45.511 --> 01:44:47.113
There are many others like
you.

01:44:48.247 --> 01:44:49.183
You're not alone.

01:44:51.684 --> 01:44:55.055
You are to meet the
need wherever necessary.

01:44:59.392 --> 01:45:03.663
Everybody, Michael, is looking
for meaning, for answers.

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.602
But not everyone is ready yet.

01:45:10.636 --> 01:45:12.438
The secret would
tear them apart.

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:18.345
But when they are ready,
that day, everything as you

01:45:18.377 --> 01:45:20.380
know it will collapse.

01:45:23.148 --> 01:45:28.187
All injustice, all the
hatred, all the lies, and all

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:30.357
your conflicts will vanish.

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:36.296
That day, everyone
will be free.

01:48:20.326 --> 01:48:22.229
Hello, this message
is for Father Michael.

01:48:22.261 --> 01:48:24.296
My name is Susanna McClure.

01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:27.267
I'm investigating an event that
occurred in Phoenix in March 1997.

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:31.571
Some time ago someone brought
us a box with some information,

01:48:31.604 --> 01:48:32.339
some materials.

01:48:34.373 --> 01:48:36.343
We believe that this
relates to you and also

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:37.911
to the events in
Phoenix back in '97.

01:48:39.578 --> 01:48:41.247
I'm very interested in
meeting you and talking

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:43.315
about this at your convenience.

01:48:43.349 --> 01:48:45.252
Please call me 305-555-3490.
