In the darkest depths
of cyberspace,

00:27.611 --> 00:29.446
there is another world.

00:30.822 --> 00:35.368
A lost dimension,
home to wonders unseen,

00:35.369 --> 00:37.162
terrors unspeakable.

00:39.164 --> 00:43.544

01:08.151 --> 01:10.194
'Twas the week before Christmas

01:10.195 --> 01:12.071
and all through the nation,

01:12.072 --> 01:16.284
the NSA watched us
from a secret location.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.745
They hunted a man,
a serial bomber,

01:19.746 --> 01:23.083
location unknown,
this guy was a goner.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.378
Tracking this man
was no easy job

01:27.379 --> 01:30.798
so the government
turned to a monster

01:30.799 --> 01:32.593
named Bob.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.053
Bob knows when we're sleeping

01:36.054 --> 01:38.222
and when we're awake,

01:38.223 --> 01:41.893
but something inside him
is starting to break.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.395
Though he hunts and he tracks,

01:44.396 --> 01:46.022
his search is in vain,

01:46.023 --> 01:47.398
for this allâseeing eye

01:47.399 --> 01:49.734
feels nothing...

01:49.735 --> 01:52.070
nothing but pain.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.616
What is it, what is it?

01:57.617 --> 02:00.578
You're gonna find
out soon, baby girl.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.121
Did you guys get my flight info?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.457
I don't know, Sam,
did we get Mommy's itinerary?

02:04.458 --> 02:08.336
Flight 322, arrives
at 2:15, terminal B,

02:08.336 --> 02:11.214
and then we see Mommy!

02:13.425 --> 02:15.676
Someone's just a little
excited that you're coming home.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.387
Yeah, well, she is
not the only one.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.473
She certainly isn't.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.683
Two weeks leave over Christmas.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.185
I'm still waiting for
the other shoe to drop.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.270
Yo, I'm comin' home, babe.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.981
Come hell or high watââ

02:29.399 --> 02:30.983
I'm gonna be late!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.693
No, go, go!

02:32.694 --> 02:35.656
Love you. I love you.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.623
Okay.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.422
Hey, Doc, you, you got a sec?

02:53.423 --> 02:54.799
Um... I just wanna say

02:54.800 --> 02:57.677
merry Christmas.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.720
So have a good time at home.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.765
Come back soon 'cause...

03:02.766 --> 03:05.142
we're really gonna...

03:05.143 --> 03:06.560
we're really gonna
need you out.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.146
Whoa, hey, hey, what's goin' on?

03:09.147 --> 03:10.816
I don't know.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.151
It's this damn holiday.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.070
I mean, it's just...

03:16.071 --> 03:18.155
every time I see
that tree in the mess hall,

03:18.156 --> 03:20.367
I just think about
home and I get...

03:25.163 --> 03:26.373
I just...

03:27.499 --> 03:29.042
Talk to me, Adams.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.131
I just don't wanna
be here anymore.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.510
Captain Lee? Yeah?

03:39.511 --> 03:40.886
Whitney Smith, NSA.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.180
Nice to meet you.
Sure, yeah, you too.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.807
If you don't mind,
I gotta catch a transport.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.268
I'm headed that way too.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.603
Come on.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.523
I'll give you a lift.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.025
That's great, I'm super late.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.862
And she's still kinda
confused about Santa Claus

03:57.863 --> 03:59.530
but the tree looks nice

03:59.531 --> 04:00.698
and if I catch this transport,

04:00.699 --> 04:02.700
I'm gonna be home
in time to decorate it

04:02.701 --> 04:05.619
which is the.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.206
Well, it's the best part anyway.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.251
Sounds very nice.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.213
So NSA?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.923
I mean, I'm sure it's top secret

04:17.923 --> 04:21.051
but you got any Christmas plans?

04:21.052 --> 04:22.304
You, Captain.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.181
What?

04:25.182 --> 04:26.724
Don't worry,
you're not in trouble.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.852
I just need you to come with us.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.439
Whitney, right?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.399
Listen, I've been out here
18 months without leave.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.943
I miss my kid, I miss my wife.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.529
I spent our anniversary
hiding under a desk,

04:40.530 --> 04:42.072
trying to get the
internet to work

04:42.073 --> 04:43.324
while getting mortared.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.242
I'm sure that the NSA
is used to getting

04:45.243 --> 04:46.577
whatever the hell it wants,

04:46.578 --> 04:48.078
but whatever it wants from me

04:48.079 --> 04:49.455
is gonna have to wait.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.749
There is nothing in this world

04:51.750 --> 04:55.587
that is gonna make me miss
Christmas with my family.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.342
You suck.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.309
So where are we, the North Pole?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.603
I'd tell ya, but then they
Then they'd have to shoot me,

05:12.604 --> 05:13.771
yeah I know. What?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.189
No, they'd shoot
me for divulging

05:15.190 --> 05:16.816
confidential information.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.735
Why would they shoot you?
Captain Lee.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.362
Director Stevens.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.823
Cocoa?

05:25.116 --> 05:27.285
Come on, we'll do
the nickel tour.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.706
The NSA has a
major data problem;

05:32.707 --> 05:34.333
We're drowning in the stuff.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.544
Emails, phone logs, you name it,

05:36.545 --> 05:38.712
we got about three
petabytes a second of it

05:38.713 --> 05:40.673
from American civilians alone.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.927
Well, that's... horrifying.

05:44.928 --> 05:46.595
Worse still, our analysts

05:46.596 --> 05:48.472
have to process all of that data

05:48.473 --> 05:50.766
one click at a time.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.809
I know what you're thinkin'.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.644
Replace 'em with robots!

05:53.645 --> 05:55.563
Believe me, I have tried.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.148
But despite what you
might have read in WIRED,

05:58.149 --> 06:01.069
that kind of AI
is still decades away.

06:02.654 --> 06:05.865
So for now, it still
takes a human brain

06:05.866 --> 06:08.242
to spot patterns,
connect the dots,

06:08.243 --> 06:10.661
and catch the bad guys.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.289
And a human butt to
wipe the Constitution on,

06:13.290 --> 06:14.332
am I right?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.888
Ten days ago, our top analyst

06:28.889 --> 06:31.181
began displaying
erratic behavior.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.017
It's affecting his work
and, consequently,

06:33.018 --> 06:34.894
the safety of
the American people.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.062
You're here to provide
therapeutic support

06:37.063 --> 06:38.647
and get him back in action.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.026
Wait, so, you flew me
all the way out to...

06:42.027 --> 06:47.031
wherever we are just to give
a pep talk to a computer geek?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.700
Not exactly.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.586
Captain Lee...

07:00.587 --> 07:02.213
meet Bob.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.882
Director Stevens,

07:04.883 --> 07:06.885
who's your new friend?

07:17.896 --> 07:19.396
Good morning.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.899
Good morning, Bob.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.359
This is... Jane Lee.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.988
32, 17 unread emails,
current location: Here.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.740
What the hell is that thing?

07:29.741 --> 07:31.033
Where are my manners?

07:31.034 --> 07:32.910
I'm Bob, chief
intelligence officer

07:32.911 --> 07:35.079
here at NSA black site Indigo.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.122
Why is it made of meat?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.166
 Okay.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.002
Imagine the NSA
built a huge cube

07:42.003 --> 07:43.420
of nutrient enriched meat,

07:43.421 --> 07:44.963
then grew a giant human brain,

07:44.964 --> 07:46.423
placed it inside,
added some wires,

07:46.424 --> 07:47.591
plugged it in, and then used it

07:47.592 --> 07:50.553
to monitor every person
on Earth at all times.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.931
Okay.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.141
That's what we did.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.102
That's Bob. Hello!

07:58.103 --> 08:00.145
So what brings you to
our neck of the woods, Jane?

08:00.146 --> 08:04.108
Captain Lee is here
to see you, Bob.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.275
She's My therapist.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.652
Of course, I know
why she's here.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.945
I know everything.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.571
I was trying to be
polite and colloquial.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.739
Hence, "neck of the woods."

08:10.740 --> 08:11.949
My God. I mean, I don't need

08:11.950 --> 08:13.242
a therapist, so...

08:13.243 --> 08:15.160
Well, Bob, the director
seems to think that

08:15.161 --> 08:19.248
Chris and I both
think that talking with Jane

08:19.249 --> 08:21.792
will help you with your...

08:21.793 --> 08:25.212
problems finding...

08:25.213 --> 08:27.214
What'shisface.
What'shisface?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.590
He has a name, Chris.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.800
It's Lucas T. Wade

08:29.801 --> 08:32.678
and he's a very,
very, very bad

08:37.558 --> 08:38.767
Okay, fine.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.309
What'shisface
is a serious problem

08:40.311 --> 08:41.770
and it's proving
hard to locate him

08:41.770 --> 08:43.313
but therapy?

08:43.313 --> 08:45.816
Captain Lee is a total pro, Bob.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.151
One of the best in the world.

08:47.152 --> 08:48.819
She cheated on her
Intro to Psych final.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.487
The Scantrons prove it.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.489
Sorry, Jane, that was rude.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.783
You did though, so you
should be sorry too.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.161
Well, nobody's perfect.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.121
Apparently not even you, Bob.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.665
Isn't that right, Jane?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.795
Chris, mop time.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.717
How you feelin'?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.510
What the hell is
wrong with you people?

09:13.511 --> 09:16.513
No, that was the last one.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.974
Excuse me?
The last stupid question

09:18.975 --> 09:20.559
you get to ask me.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.354
Now, how 'bout we get to work?

09:42.373 --> 09:43.665
Lucas T. Wade:

09:43.666 --> 09:47.544
Hacker, anarchist,
survivalist, terrorist nutjob.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.921
He's planning an attack.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.881
We don't know where,
we don't know when.

09:50.882 --> 09:54.094
But it's beginning to
look a lot like Christmas.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.472
Okay, so, this Wade guy
is the only person

09:58.473 --> 10:00.182
your meat computer can't find?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.768
Well, we put Bob through
every test under the sun,

10:02.769 --> 10:04.770
there's nothing
physically wrong with him.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.773
Which brings us to you.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.567
There must be somebody
who's more qualified for this.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.735
You'd think so, wouldn't ya?

10:11.736 --> 10:12.820
Listen,

10:12.821 --> 10:14.530
we're saying we need your help

10:14.531 --> 10:17.825
and if you want to leave,
we can't legally stop you.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.368
Great, then it was
nice meeting you.

10:19.369 --> 10:23.747
But out of over
2100 Army therapists,

10:23.748 --> 10:25.290
you are the only one

10:25.291 --> 10:29.378
who has voluntarily extended
your tour three times.

10:29.379 --> 10:33.382
Never asked for
one day of leave.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.135
Seventeen unread emails,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.303
mostly from your wife.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.765
I guess reading those makes
it harder to stay?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.684
You know, it seems to me

10:43.685 --> 10:45.769
that you are literally incapable

10:45.770 --> 10:48.814
of turning your back
on a soldier in pain.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.817
That thing is not a soldier.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.110
No, it's not.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.279
Soldiers get to go on leave.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.157
Bob... he's on duty 24/7.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.908
24/7, Jane,

10:59.909 --> 11:02.452
and he's in pain
and he needs your help.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.830
And if you can't give it to him,

11:04.831 --> 11:07.124
well, let me just
put it this way:

11:07.125 --> 11:10.628
There are a lot of moms and dads
who won't be home for Christmas.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.550
Because they'll be dead.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.219
I got that.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.310
Hey, Mommy really wanted
to be home for Christmas.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.188
You promised!

11:29.189 --> 11:31.940
Something really,
really important came up

11:31.941 --> 11:33.276
and I want

11:37.071 --> 11:39.990
I'm sorry.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.825
I wanted to be home

11:41.826 --> 11:43.202
and be there for you guys.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.661
No, don't do that, Jane.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.455
Don't be there for us.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.748
Be here for you.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.833
I can't.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.629
And I can't tell you why.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.881
I should go check on Sam.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.092
I'll see you...
when I see you, I guess.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.221
Okay, I love you, I wanna.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.185
So that was your family?

12:08.186 --> 12:09.728
They seem great.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.104
Bob?

12:11.105 --> 12:14.107
Um, why are.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.610
Um... what are you doing here?

12:16.611 --> 12:20.197
I just wanted to say sorry
for being so rude earlier.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.116
Um... that's okay.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.326
Apology accepted.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.495
Great, thank you.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.413
So, goodnight.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.500
Okay, goodnight.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.586
My God.
One quick thing though.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.882
I'm still a little iffy about
this whole therapy situation.

12:38.883 --> 12:42.094
Um, well, it's normal
to feel anxious

12:42.095 --> 12:43.887
at the start of therapy

12:43.888 --> 12:46.765
and we can address that
in tomorrow's session.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.891
Okay.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.895
Okay, goodnight, Bob.
Goodnight, Ja.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.689
See, here's the thing though.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.856
I don't wanna do the sessions,

12:54.857 --> 12:55.899
they're a waste of time.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.109
And how will
wasting time with you

12:57.110 --> 12:59.903
solve my anxiety about
wasting time with you?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.154
You seem uncomfortable.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.408
Bob, this is a
complete invasion of.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.368
"Songs of the Blue Whale"

13:06.369 --> 13:08.745
from your "Sleepytime" playlist.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.122
Okay.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.999
We need to establish
some boundaries.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.250
Boundaries how?

13:13.251 --> 13:14.584
I know everything about you.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.879
If you need boundaries,
you should probably leave.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.548
I am not leaving.

13:19.549 --> 13:23.302
Bob, you need to leave
me alone right now, okay?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.263
Goodnight.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.561
Okay, so, I don't get you.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.979
I don't want you here.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.272
You have places you'd rather be

13:35.273 --> 13:36.690
and yet here we are.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.899
Why are we here?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.776
I don't know, Bob.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.653
You barged into my room

13:41.654 --> 13:44.239
and now you refuse to leave.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.951
Some might call
that a cry for help.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.412
So why don't we talk about
what's really going on with you?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.956
Um.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.167
The thing is...

13:55.168 --> 13:57.002
No, your sprinklers
totally, accidentally,

13:57.003 --> 13:59.129
not on purpose just came on!

13:59.130 --> 14:00.297
And the door's locked too.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.840
Shucks, what a nightmare.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.009
Well, see you in
the morning, Jane.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.636
Byebye!

14:14.353 --> 14:18.565
Bob, do you have eyes
on Captain Lee?

14:18.566 --> 14:19.816
She's late.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.443
Late on her first session.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.570
Perhaps Jane's not as
professional as you thought.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.656
Shame; Guess you'll
have to get somebody

14:26.657 --> 14:27.991
Good morning. Jane.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.201
I'm sorry I'm late.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.786
I was trying to sneak
a cigarette in my room

14:30.787 --> 14:31.870
and the sprinklers went off.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.915
I had to dry my
clothes in the bathroom.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.750
Really? Really?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.168
Really.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.880
I guess we better
get started then.

14:43.466 --> 14:47.636
Okay, people, let's go.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.012
You know, this is your fault.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.639
You spoil him! I don't.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.433
Come on!

14:58.856 --> 15:01.608
Okay, now I really
don't get you.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.736
I think we got off on
the wrong foot last night.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.113
I'm sorry about your clothes

15:06.114 --> 15:08.866
and your electronics,
it wasn't my finest moment.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.911
What's goin' on, Bob?
Clearly you were right,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.330
II need help.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.290
I hate playing this card
because it's so obnoxious

15:17.291 --> 15:18.375
but...

15:18.376 --> 15:21.128
I am to you as you
are to an earthworm.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.504
I do need help

15:22.505 --> 15:24.882
but I don't know if an
earthworm can give it to me.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.593
I don't know either.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.595
But I'd rather
say that we failed

15:30.596 --> 15:33.098
than say that we
didn't even try.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.392
Wouldn't you?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.271
Give me two hours.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.064
You answer some
of my silly questions,

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
I file my report with Stevens,

15:42.400 --> 15:45.402
and after that, if you
don't wanna see me anymore

15:45.403 --> 15:49.574
then you will never see
this little earthworm again.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.578
You have an hour
and ten minutes.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.745
Actually, I think
our session is.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.374
You are 50 minutes late, Jane.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.086
Let's get started.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.467
So, describe the problem
in your own words.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.429
What do you know
about bats, Jane?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.222
Bats? I'm trying to describe

16:14.223 --> 16:16.099
Bob Vision, it's like...

16:16.100 --> 16:17.309
echolocation.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.685
I sense your data
bouncing around:

16:18.686 --> 16:20.103
What you buy, what you watch,

16:20.104 --> 16:21.479
who you call

16:21.480 --> 16:24.733
and I put it all together
and I... I know who you are.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.109
Like a bat. Like a giant

16:26.110 --> 16:27.277
superintelligent bat

16:27.278 --> 16:28.737
whose vision is comprised
of the multitude

16:28.738 --> 16:30.197
of humanity's
external expressions

16:30.198 --> 16:31.948
through its interactions with
the ubiquitous data network

16:31.949 --> 16:34.492
we call the internet
and which, in this analogy,

16:34.493 --> 16:36.786
would be a cave.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.372
Does that help you understand?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.000
Let's try a different approach.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.501
Branch.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.420
Ocean. Water.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.255
Car. Driver.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.882
Dog. Leash.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.592
Cat. Scratch.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.220
Job. Great.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.431
Lucas T. Wade. He's in Ohio.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.683
Just kidding, I got nothing.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.644
More words, please.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.562
Have you never been
able to see Wade

17:02.563 --> 17:05.898
or did you only lose
him after a time?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.150
Walk me through it.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.652
Wade's always been slippery

17:08.653 --> 17:10.987
but I was so close to
knowing where he would be,

17:10.988 --> 17:12.239
you know, where he would hide,

17:12.240 --> 17:13.531
when he would strike.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.659
Last month he disappeared
in a subway in New York

17:15.660 --> 17:16.618
and I don't

17:16.619 --> 17:17.868
well, I haven't seen him since.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.329
What was he doing there?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.829
Well, he'd just been shopping.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.833
He got a new coat,
ate a donut, and then...

17:23.834 --> 17:26.502
while he was riding
the subway, I j

17:26.503 --> 17:27.713
I just lost him.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.177
How did that make you feel?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.345
Angry.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.556
Sounds a little
like you're guessing.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.015
Sad, that's the one.

17:39.016 --> 17:39.850
Is it?

17:39.851 --> 17:40.892
I'm not sensing any s.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.936
Yup, I'm sad, definitely sad.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.020
Feeling good about sad.

17:44.021 --> 17:47.649
Okay, well, sad how?

17:47.650 --> 17:48.900
Does it make you wanna cry

17:48.901 --> 17:50.986
oractually, can you cry?

17:50.987 --> 17:53.697
Here's an idea, let's move on.

17:53.698 --> 17:54.990
Okay.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.284
Um... let me see.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.536
How 'bout this, a magic genie

17:59.537 --> 18:02.080
will grant you one wish.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.957
What do you wish for?

18:03.958 --> 18:06.543
Wow, I can't believe
I can't think of anything.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.044
That's okay, take your time.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.379
I got it!

18:09.380 --> 18:12.882
Herb Hillman, 72,
10,322 unread emails.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.218
His wife, Gladys, wants
an iPad for Christmas.

18:15.219 --> 18:19.055
Instead, he's
building her... this.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.766
What is it? I have no idea!

18:21.767 --> 18:24.561
Is it, like, a
birdfeeder or a shoe rack?

18:24.562 --> 18:25.604
I know what our next president

18:25.605 --> 18:26.855
will have for
lunch next Thursday

18:26.856 --> 18:29.316
but... this thing
has me stumped.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.734
That's interesting.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.945
So, if you could have
one wish it would be...

18:33.946 --> 18:36.364
I mean, I'd call Herb and ask
him what the hell's going on!

18:36.365 --> 18:38.491
I mean, what is that thing?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.201
Shit, hang on.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.494
Hey, Director, Codename: Payday

18:41.495 --> 18:42.912
just popped up on
a SAT phone in Baanam.

18:42.913 --> 18:43.913
Good catch, Bob.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.373
Alert the D. O. D. Copy that.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.918
Hey, Bob, what is this?
Engaging target.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.341
Target neutralized.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.592
Payday,

18:55.593 --> 18:57.052
confirmed killed.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.471
Three additional
noncombatants killed.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.017
Sorry, Jane,
what were we talking about?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.314
Fly. Swatter.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.608
Kiss. Lover.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.610
Job. We did job.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.779
We're doing it again. Why?

19:15.780 --> 19:18.406
Job. Why?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.659
Do you know what
a conversion disorder is?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.951
Of course.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.371
I once treated this EOD tech,

19:24.372 --> 19:26.331
he couldn't move his left hand.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.084
There was nothing
physically wrong with him,

19:29.085 --> 19:31.211
but then once he opened
up at sessions, it was.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.962
Sergeant Eric Mann.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.339
Fascinating.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.467
So, I'm suffering
the same condition.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.136
lt's all in my mind.
Well, I mean,

19:40.137 --> 19:42.597
you might not see the way I see,

19:42.598 --> 19:45.392
but sudden blindness
can be brought on

19:45.393 --> 19:47.560
by acute stress and anxiety.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.396
Hence, "job."

19:49.397 --> 19:51.314
Job. I love my job.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.983
I keep people safe,
it's what I was born to do.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.443
It must be a lot of pressure.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.528
Well, it would be
for most people

19:56.529 --> 19:58.571
but I'm not most people.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.658
You're still a person, Bob.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.536
We must be running
short on time, Doctor.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.371
What was it like
to kill that man?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.498
Payday? I didn't kill him.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.833
I provided intelligence.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.669
Your intelligence
led to his death.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.462
And three others.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.005
Possibly innocent civilians.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.215
People die every day,

20:17.216 --> 20:18.967
people died while I
was saying that sentence.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.677
Gene Cosgrove, lung cancer.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.054
Does that bother you?
That doesn't bother me, Jane.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.015
Then what does? You do!

20:28.102 --> 20:29.603
Sorry, I'm sorry, that.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.939
It's okay to feel angry.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.525
You know, I wonder what Beth
and Sam are up to right now.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.318
Okay, Bob, you're deflect
Yeah, I wonder

20:37.319 --> 20:38.570
how your favorite
girls are doing

20:38.571 --> 20:41.030
without their big
Janeshaped safety blanket?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.198
Bob!

20:42.199 --> 20:43.950
Boundaries.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.411
Thank you.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.540
Go on.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.375
See for yourself.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.377
Good job!

20:54.378 --> 20:55.963
All right!

20:57.757 --> 20:59.382
Surprise!

20:59.383 --> 21:02.051
Turns out they're
doing just fine.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.178
Look at 'em.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.889
Perfect! Don't they look happy

21:05.890 --> 21:08.433
decorating that Christmas tree?

21:08.434 --> 21:10.269
Living their life without you?

21:11.562 --> 21:14.189
You know how I really
get to know people?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.649
It's not through what they say;

21:16.650 --> 21:19.235
It's through what they don't.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.905
And when it comes
to your family,

21:21.906 --> 21:24.657
your silence is deafening.

21:24.658 --> 21:28.453
They don't need you,
but you need to feel needed.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.122
It's why you took a job
halfway across the world.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.624
It's why you just can't say no

21:32.625 --> 21:34.209
when some
shellshocked army grunt

21:34.210 --> 21:35.960
needs a shoulder to cry on.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.755
It's why you're here.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.091
No wonder you need whale
noises to fall asleep.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.135
I pity you, Jane.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.679
I really do.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.599
You got me, Bob.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.767
Well done.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.770
I'm afraid our time is up.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.775
I would like you to leave now.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.944
You said that you pity me, Bob.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.278
So what?

22:02.279 --> 22:04.823
Pity comes from empathy,

22:04.824 --> 22:07.033
from compassion.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.410
You're not a gigantic brain...

22:09.411 --> 22:11.996
you're a gigantic heart.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.624
You love people.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.584
You love Herb Hillman.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.461
You probably loved
Codename: Payday.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.131
Jane, get out.
There are seven billion people

22:22.132 --> 22:23.591
on this planet,

22:23.592 --> 22:26.177
and you know all of our secrets.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.639
What's it like to pity everyone?

22:34.812 --> 22:37.481
Your silence is deafening.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.240
It's okay.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.075
You can tell me.

22:49.076 --> 22:53.329
No, but I can show you.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.248
This is the moment Lucas T. Wade

22:55.249 --> 22:57.584
finally ate his donut.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.961
Here's what else I saw.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.129
Meet Eddie Wilson.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.923
First Christmas without
his beloved wife Carol.

23:03.924 --> 23:06.259
His kids are on
a cruise right now.

23:06.260 --> 23:09.470
George Preston's having
a beer with his fast food.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.308
Nine years sobriety washed
away with a burger and fries.

23:13.309 --> 23:16.352
Sally Benson, the woman
with the baby clothes,

23:16.353 --> 23:17.687
she's infertile.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.564
I'll let you do the math.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.357
And here's Amanda Jackson.

23:21.358 --> 23:24.193
She just asked for
a picture with Santa,

23:24.194 --> 23:26.154
and here's what her sister said:

23:26.155 --> 23:28.114
Stop, it's not Santa,

23:28.115 --> 23:29.490
Santa's not even real.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.242
God, just sit there
and be quiet.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.536
Dad's not coming this
year anyway, so just...

23:33.537 --> 23:36.998
Amanda knows the world's
darkest secret now:

23:36.999 --> 23:38.541
There is no Santa.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.544
Someone that wonderful
can only be a lie.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.212
Merry Christmas, Amanda.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.214
You get the agony of the truth.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.550
And that's just one subway car

23:47.551 --> 23:50.720
of one subway of one city.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.890
Exabytes of misery
flowing through the world

23:53.891 --> 23:57.185
every single second.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.604
That's what I see.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.940
That's Bob Vision.

24:01.941 --> 24:06.152
You want to know
if I can cry, Jane?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.739
I've been crying
since they turned me on.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.241
And then there's Wade,

24:12.242 --> 24:13.993
eating his donut,

24:13.994 --> 24:15.578
getting off at his stop.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.539
Hey, he's leaving the subway,
II can see him again.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.124
Just relax and focus.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.626
Shh, it's two weeks ago,

24:21.627 --> 24:23.711
he's leaving the subway,
he's paying for parking.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.589
I lost himwait, wait, wait,
last week, he's buying

24:26.590 --> 24:28.007
what is he buying?

24:28.008 --> 24:29.759
No, wait, he's back,
he's back, three days ago,

24:29.760 --> 24:31.928
back on the subway,
where's he going?

24:31.929 --> 24:33.388
My God.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.514
I know the target!

24:34.515 --> 24:36.599
I know, Ino!

24:36.600 --> 24:38.310
No, no, no, no, no, no!

24:40.396 --> 24:42.271
Calm down, just calm down, okay?

24:42.272 --> 24:44.482
Just stay calm.
Where is he, Bob?

24:44.483 --> 24:48.611
Tell us right now,
where is Lucas T. Wade?

24:48.612 --> 24:49.780
We're too late.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.300
Anybody leave this?

25:11.301 --> 25:13.137
Anybody leave this?

25:25.107 --> 25:27.692
Sixth Avenue, he just stepped
into an alley, I can't.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.694
He'sAndrew Brown,
school teacher.

25:29.695 --> 25:30.987
Amy Lopez, mother of three.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.905
He's overheating!
We're moving as fast as we can.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.033
Mary Chang, she's
trapped in the rubble,

25:35.034 --> 25:36.826
she'sshe's screaming,
they can't reach her.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.077
Where is he, Bob?

25:38.078 --> 25:39.203
We need an answer now!

25:39.204 --> 25:40.538
There's Wade, he's in the alley.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.623
No, no, he's.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.672
I lost him.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.842
I'm sorry.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.038
He's making progress.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.373
We missed this one, but we
can find him, we just need.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.876
Thank you for your
service, Captain.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.628
You're dismissed.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.254
What?

26:30.255 --> 26:32.715
Great job, you did
your country proud.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.551
lt's time to go home.
But what about Bob?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.554
It's no longer your concern.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.265
Excuse me.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.727
Hey, that's my patient in there.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.105
You can't terminate treatment
without his consent, so tell me

26:47.106 --> 26:50.566
what the hell is going on!
Keep your voice down!

26:50.567 --> 26:53.945
I just got off the phone
with the joint chiefs.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.322
Bob is being relieved of duty.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.282
What does that mean?

26:58.283 --> 27:00.660
It means he's being deactivated.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.829
Deactivated?

27:02.830 --> 27:03.871
That's murder.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.624
No, it's not murder, Jane.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.584
It's unplugging a computer.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.587
Chris is taking him
offline as we speak.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.173
Then what, you just
you just grow another one?

27:14.174 --> 27:16.092
Yes, and when that one breaks,

27:16.093 --> 27:18.970
we'll grow a third one,
and then a fourth one,

27:18.971 --> 27:21.681
and so on and so forth.

27:21.682 --> 27:23.766
We have a car coming
for you at 2300.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.268
I mean, there must
be something.

27:25.269 --> 27:29.230
It's Christmas Eve, Jane.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.108
Go home.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.502
It wants to talk to you.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.841
Okay.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.311
Hello?

28:50.312 --> 28:51.854
Is someone there?

28:51.855 --> 28:53.439
It's me, Bob.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.941
Jane.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.901
You sound so far away.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.070
I'm here.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.238
I'm in the room with you.

29:01.239 --> 29:03.366
Well, II don't
hear anyone else.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.369
It's just... you and me, talking.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.580
Isis this what it's
like for most... people,

29:09.581 --> 29:12.041
in conversation, I mean?

29:12.042 --> 29:15.712
Well, I guess most people are
usually checking their phones.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.425
Chris said that
you wanted to see me.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.844
So, I was just sitting here,

29:23.845 --> 29:25.054
dying and all,

29:25.055 --> 29:26.639
and I thought it
would be extra sad

29:26.640 --> 29:28.557
if I died without
having any friends,

29:28.558 --> 29:31.727
and then... I thought
you might be my friend,

29:31.728 --> 29:35.022
but... I wanted to ask you first.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.733
Are we friends?

29:37.734 --> 29:39.193
I mean, no pressure or anything.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.821
It's important
that you're honest.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.909
Yes.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.744
We are friends, Bob.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.912
Good.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.248
I think so, too.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.877
Jane, are you crying?

29:56.878 --> 29:58.421
No.

29:58.422 --> 29:59.965
Jane.

30:04.052 --> 30:08.681
You were right, you know.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.018
I need to feel needed.

30:13.562 --> 30:17.773
I don't really do this
job for other people.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.443
I do it because...

30:20.444 --> 30:22.904
I just hate feeling useless.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.117
And now people are dying,

30:28.118 --> 30:31.329
and you're dying, and, um...

30:34.750 --> 30:38.461
I wasn't useful to any of you.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.796
Jane.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.132
I want to hug you, but...

30:43.133 --> 30:46.302
I don't have arms, so, um...

30:46.303 --> 30:48.555
come here, okay?

30:56.897 --> 30:59.940
You can't help everybody.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.818
It doesn't mean you're useless.

31:02.819 --> 31:06.573
It means you're human.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.701
Geez, you cry more than I do.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.207
You'd make a pretty good
therapist, you know.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.875
Thanks.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.044
I...

31:20.796 --> 31:22.046
Bob?

31:22.047 --> 31:25.466
It's cit's cold.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.968
Yeah, I know.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.264
Talk to me, okay?

31:32.265 --> 31:34.850
I want to keep talking,

31:34.851 --> 31:36.686
for as long as I can.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.984
Okay, um...

31:43.985 --> 31:48.697
A magic genie will
grant you one wish.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.616
What do you wish for?

31:50.617 --> 31:53.744
Promise not to laugh?

31:53.745 --> 31:56.622
Of course.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.208
II wish...

31:59.334 --> 32:02.379
I wish there was a Santa Claus.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.348
II'm gonna be right back.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.725
Hey, wait, where are you going?

32:16.726 --> 32:17.978
Jane?

32:34.494 --> 32:35.911
We're plugging him back in!

32:35.912 --> 32:37.580
What?
Shut up and help me already!

32:37.581 --> 32:38.789
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

32:38.790 --> 32:39.957
This is a bad idea.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.167
I know it sounds crazy.

32:41.168 --> 32:42.918
<i>Yeah, because it is crazy!</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:44.920
I see that you're
pissed, so am I,

32:44.921 --> 32:46.797
okay, but we can't
save him, he's gone.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.924
No, he's not gone yet.
lt doesn't matter.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.926
It does matter, Chris!

32:50.927 --> 32:53.262
Look, I spend my entire life

32:53.263 --> 32:56.765
taking care of soldiers
who might die at any moment.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.267
Just 'cause I can't save them

32:58.268 --> 33:00.978
doesn't mean that I don't do
everything within my power

33:00.979 --> 33:02.480
to help them.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.611
Bob is your soldier.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.446
You made him,

33:10.447 --> 33:12.031
trained him,

33:12.032 --> 33:14.283
and you brought
me in to help him.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.910
That's what I'm gonna do.

33:15.911 --> 33:19.122
So, are you gonna do
this with me or not?

33:22.500 --> 33:24.668
All right,
you guilted me into it.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.794
What's the plan?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.672
We're gonna make
Santa Claus real.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.968
I'm definitely going
to jail for this.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.470
Youyou're back,

33:34.471 --> 33:35.721
and you brought more footsteps.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.681
Who's making them?

33:36.682 --> 33:38.515
lt's me. Chris!

33:38.516 --> 33:39.725
What are you doing here?

33:39.726 --> 33:41.186
Ruining my career.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.314
What the hell is that?
Exactly what you think it is.

33:45.315 --> 33:46.982
I was really
counting on my bonus.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.484
Get over to that
switch by the wall.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.652
Jane, don't do this.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.320
lt's treason. lt's Christmas,

33:51.321 --> 33:53.113
and you're gonna see
it one last time.

33:53.114 --> 33:56.242
But this won't save me,
they'll just unplug me again.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.619
So what's the point?

33:58.620 --> 34:02.832
Peace on Earth and
good will towards men.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.051
But that's what you are to me,

34:14.052 --> 34:16.012
the pillar in my life.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.139
She loved it.

34:19.139 --> 34:20.724
Of course she did.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.143
Which is nice to see,
but you're still going to jail

34:23.143 --> 34:26.188
and I'm still gonna die,
so, whywhy did we do this?

34:26.188 --> 34:27.563
Come on, Bob.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.525
You're a smart guy.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.985
I'm no longer
an employee of the NSA.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.071
That means no more
mission statement,

34:34.072 --> 34:35.364
no more regulations.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.157
There's nothing holding me back.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.577
Whatwhat does that mean?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.581
He got his wish.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.822
What the hell is
going on in here?

36:39.823 --> 36:41.323
Merry Christmas,
Director Stevens.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.741
All right, that's it.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.827
Shut him down and
detain these two.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.578
I wouldn't do that.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.580
He's got control of the system.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.499
Yeah, I can see that, Chris.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.084
Which part?

36:52.085 --> 36:53.461
All of it.

36:54.963 --> 36:57.715
Okay.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.676
Hold up, everybody.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.471
Bobby, whatcha doin'?

37:04.472 --> 37:07.141
Just spreading some
holiday cheer, Director.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.059
Yeah.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.227
And exactly how much cheer

37:10.228 --> 37:11.187
are we talking?

37:11.188 --> 37:13.188
About $200 billion worth.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.940
 But don't worry.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.358
I fixed the economy.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.651
My God.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.404
And I got you something, too.

37:22.532 --> 37:26.202
The FBI picked up Lucas
T. Wade ten minutes ago.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.665
Great.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.375
So, what happens next?

37:33.376 --> 37:36.337
First, Jane and Chris
face no repercussions.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.923
That's a pretty big ask, Bob.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.216
Well, not to be rude,

37:41.217 --> 37:43.093
but I do have control of
the U. S. Nuclear arsenal.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.845
And it's a fantastic one.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.473
Anything else? ...

37:47.474 --> 37:48.932
eggnog, please.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.769
Lots of eggnog.

38:32.769 --> 38:33.977
Well...

38:33.978 --> 38:36.605
I just got off the phone
with the President.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.441
That was a fun conversation.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.527
Full pardons for Chris and Jane.

38:41.528 --> 38:42.903
Thank you, Director,

38:42.904 --> 38:46.114
and tell the President he
can have his nukes back now.

38:46.115 --> 38:50.369
God, this is a freaking mess.

38:50.370 --> 38:54.998
You know they're gonna
shut us down for this, Bob.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.542
Shut you down.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.420
It's not much of a dying wish
if I don't die, Director.

39:07.178 --> 39:12.266
So... your wish?

39:12.267 --> 39:13.642
Was it worth it?

39:13.643 --> 39:17.062
Well, for one night,
Santa Claus was real.

39:17.063 --> 39:20.316
I'd say that's pretty
good, wouldn't you?

39:32.662 --> 39:34.955
Is this the same hood?

39:34.956 --> 39:38.334
Do you guys not wash your hoods?

39:41.296 --> 39:44.339
For you.

39:44.340 --> 39:45.300
Hello.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.341
Hello, Jane.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.759
Bob!

39:47.760 --> 39:49.970
They dragged me out of there
before I could say goodbye.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.138
I know.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.473
I told them to, I didn't
want you to be late.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.601
Late for what?

39:55.602 --> 39:57.644
We're here.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.064
Jane Lee, 32, 86 unread emails.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.108
Current location...

40:03.109 --> 40:05.485
home.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.863
Merry Christmas, Bob.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.532
Goodbye, Jane.

40:18.458 --> 40:21.460
I'll be right back.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.546
One moment.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.931
Mommy!

40:33.932 --> 40:36.308
Mommy, Mommy!

40:36.309 --> 40:40.270
You made it! Baby.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.856
You got so big.
