00:04.963 --> 00:09.091
Willie: I am hungry!
Isn't this amazing?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.926
So when they do
the take-out,

00:10.969 --> 00:12.302
they do little different
animals and I think

00:12.345 --> 00:13.637
these are swans.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.100
[phone noises]

00:18.143 --> 00:18.851
What's everybody doing?

00:18.893 --> 00:22.312
[phone noises]

00:22.355 --> 00:23.647
Is anyone listening to me?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.692
Korie: What?

00:26.735 --> 00:27.860
>> You realize everybody's
just on their phone?

00:27.902 --> 00:29.111
>> I'm on my iPad.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.280
>> Well what should-

00:31.322 --> 00:32.531
what do you want
us to do?

00:32.574 --> 00:33.782
>> I mean just look
at that isn't that cool?

00:33.825 --> 00:35.159
>> Yeah hold it up, I want
to take a picture.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.660
>> Why do we have to take a
picture of everything?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.579
>> That's cool!
I'm going to put it in

00:38.621 --> 00:39.705
the family group text.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.789
>> But everybody's
sitting right here!

00:42.250 --> 00:44.043
John Luke: That's
a funny picture right there.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.003
That's a good one mom.
>> John Luke it's right here.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.504
This is the real thing!

00:48.590 --> 00:49.423
>> Oh.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.426
>> Look I'm all for
cell phones.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.386
I use them for just
about everything,

00:54.429 --> 00:56.597
but when it starts
taking over your family,

00:56.639 --> 00:58.599
that's when things
get out of control.

00:58.641 --> 00:59.683
What's the deal with Will,
is he asleep?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.060
>> Yeah his phone died.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.020
>> See that's the problem,
he can't even function

01:03.063 --> 01:04.229
without his phone.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.773
Family time used
to be bored games

01:05.815 --> 01:07.316
and capture the flag.

01:07.358 --> 01:10.652
Now my kids are
DM'ing me to borrow the car.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.863
You are missing out
on the great things of life,

01:12.906 --> 01:16.033
like takeout that comes
in the shape of an animal.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.577
>> That's crazy.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.953
Say it again I'm sorry.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.039
>> We're out of control.
I think it's safe to say,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.916
we got a problem.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.375
Alright here's what
we're going to do.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.961
We're going to have
a little tech time out.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.464
We're going to all
turn our phones in.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.007
We will not be distracted by-

01:32.050 --> 01:33.842
>> I got a text from
Tee Mama let me just

01:33.885 --> 01:37.679
respond to her and-
[phone clicking]

01:37.722 --> 01:39.932
>> All right, tomorrow's
the day I'm taking all

01:39.974 --> 01:42.726
technology,
cell phones, games.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.479
>> All right, sounds good.
>> It's going to be fun.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.732
>> All right!
>> No technology!

01:48.775 --> 01:49.733
Where's the remote?

01:50.235 --> 01:57.449
[rock music]
[ducks quacking]

02:02.747 --> 02:04.081
Martin: When's Reed
getting married?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.750
Jase: Oh it's the first
Saturday in November.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.835
>> No!

02:07.877 --> 02:09.294
>> I said you can't
plan a wedding,

02:09.337 --> 02:11.922
the day LSU's
playing Alabama!

02:11.965 --> 02:13.048
>>Martin: Agreed.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.299
>> That's why you
always get married

02:14.342 --> 02:16.009
in the summer months.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.261
>> But then
it gets too hot.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.595
Godwin: But you
can't do it in the spring,

02:18.638 --> 02:20.139
because the fishers come.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.098
>> That's what I'm
talking about.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.516
You got April and May
that's it.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.600
>> Summer months.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.811
>> This is common
sense, I thought.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.187
Jep: Sup fellas?
>> Oh boy.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.023
[laughing]
>> Jep!

02:30.066 --> 02:32.568
>> You like my new hat?
>> No.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.236
>> You worried about
getting sunburned?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.821
>> This is the new
style brother.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.322
[laughing]

02:37.365 --> 02:38.615
>> The new style?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.284
>> You look like a
large gardener.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.535
>> Tour guide.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.704
>> Scout leader!
Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties,

02:43.746 --> 02:45.414
he wore a hat like that!

02:45.456 --> 02:46.999
>> If you wear that in public-

02:47.041 --> 02:50.252
>> I've worn it in
public all day, nobody cares.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.087
In fact, I get
compliments on it.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.964
>> You don't
understand sarcasm.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.674
>> I feel sorry for
ya'll, ya'll have-

02:55.717 --> 02:58.260
you just don't know
what's going on these days.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.970
>> The one thing
that everyone can count

03:00.013 --> 03:02.264
on in the duck call
shop, is honesty.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.392
We're going to speak
the truth, in love.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.187
>> That's a woman's hat!
>> No it's not a woman's hat!

03:08.229 --> 03:09.605
>> That is a woman's hat!

03:09.647 --> 03:11.315
>> He's having a midlife crisis.
>> Yup.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.318
>> I'm not that old!
>> Mid life crisis.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.988
>> It is our duty to make
sure that Jep realizes,

03:18.031 --> 03:19.823
that he made a mistake.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.702
But for Jep to wear this hat,
he made several.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.621
>> Anybody who's anybody
wears a hat, that's cool.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.206
>> Yeah, but
that looks stupid, no?

03:27.248 --> 03:29.458
>> I don't really know
what to say about that.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.043
>> You're only
wearing half a hat.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.003
>> He put the hat
on in the first place.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.798
He ventured out into
public, and last,

03:36.841 --> 03:39.092
and probably the
most grievous,

03:39.135 --> 03:41.345
is he had the
audacity to walk in

03:41.387 --> 03:43.055
the duck call room.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.224
What did you think
was going to happen?

03:45.266 --> 03:47.559
I mean it's like you
want to be Indiana Jones,

03:47.602 --> 03:49.394
but you're a nerd.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.521
>> That would be Deleware Jones.
>> Why Deleware?

03:51.564 --> 03:54.483
>> Because Deleware's
a nerdy state.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.567
>> That makes no sense.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.526
>> Ain't nothing but
nerds there!

03:56.569 --> 03:58.612
>> Hhmm.
They all wear the big

03:58.655 --> 04:00.989
thick rimmed glasses, okay?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.449
>> So far you're
describing yourself so-

04:02.492 --> 04:03.659
>> No.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.954
>> I'm going to go to the
bathroom, here.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.873
Take the hat off,
make you happy.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.500
>> The bathroom's
where that thing belongs

04:11.542 --> 04:12.459
you might want to take
it with you.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.460
Jep: Very funny,

04:13.503 --> 04:14.836
>> Look you need
a hat like that.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.129
>> I do?
>> Yeah.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.382
>> Good grief he's got a big-

04:18.424 --> 04:20.342
>> You know what,
you don't look as idiotic.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.094
>> I don't know why
these guys are jumping

04:22.136 --> 04:24.012
on Jep so bad
about that hat.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.764
>> I think it actually
looks pretty good on

04:25.807 --> 04:27.224
him for a little girls hat.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.433
They've always
called him the baby

04:28.476 --> 04:30.018
sister of the family
anyway.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.688
>> Take a picture-
>> And send it to Jep.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.690
>> There you go.
>> What does he look like?

04:34.732 --> 04:37.192
>> Give me that!
Seriously, what was Jep

04:37.235 --> 04:39.027
thinking when he
got dressed this morning.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.781
You know what can
I put on my head today,

04:42.824 --> 04:45.575
that would terrify
men and beast?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.828
>> You look like
Gilligan if he had on

04:47.870 --> 04:49.746
a brown hat instead
of a white hat.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.957
>> The senior citizen
years of Gilligan.

04:52.000 --> 04:52.916
>> What are you
talking about?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.084
Here you go,
put it on big man!

04:54.127 --> 04:55.377
>> Woah! Hey!

04:55.420 --> 04:58.380
>> When did Hogwarts
start offering adult classes?

04:58.423 --> 05:00.590
>> You look like one
of those quakers.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.801
>> Ya'll watch wrassling,
the Undertaker!

05:02.844 --> 05:04.553
>> That's not him.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.431
>> Or look, it could
be a simple as he's got

05:07.473 --> 05:09.891
a field of crops that
needs protection.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.351
Who knows.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.936
>> Got your pictures
very funny.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.188
>> You like that?

05:15.231 --> 05:18.025
>> Good jokes, good jokes.
What's funny is,

05:18.067 --> 05:19.901
I think the jokes
on ya'll.

05:19.944 --> 05:20.861
>> What?

05:20.903 --> 05:22.279
>> What are you
talking about?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.072
>> Jessica just told me,
my whole family's got lice.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.658
>> What!
>> My kids have lice.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.077
>> I just had this hat on.
>> We all had that hat on.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.037
>> I ain't worried
about it because I can't

05:30.079 --> 05:31.705
get them I had them.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.831
>> Oh no you can get them.
>> No, that's a myth.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.374
>> No!
>> Yeah.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.752
>> Ain't no myth to it!
>> It ain't chicken pox.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.045
>> I cant get them.
>> Huh?

05:38.087 --> 05:40.297
>> I've had them!
>> Look, we have two options-

05:40.340 --> 05:43.425
>> Burnt moto oil!
>> No that's not an option.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.135
>> You has to take
a bath and look-

05:45.178 --> 05:46.511
>> Here's the two options-
>> Motor oil?

05:46.554 --> 05:47.888
>> Hey it suffocates them!

05:47.930 --> 05:50.140
>> We can shave
from head to toe,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.475
that's option one.

05:51.517 --> 05:55.771
Option two, I know
a lice expert.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.273
>> Call him.
And burn that hat!

05:58.316 --> 05:59.816
>> You'd better be
careful, you're on the

05:59.859 --> 06:01.193
side of the street to
the danger zone.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.994
Willie: All right,
ya'll ready to go fishing!

06:11.037 --> 06:13.288
>> Yeah, totally.
>> Sure.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.498
>> This is actually
really cool.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.834
There's no technology,
no phones, no GPS's on

06:17.877 --> 06:20.170
the vehicle, so you
kids are in charge of

06:20.213 --> 06:22.255
getting us there and
you have an old

06:22.298 --> 06:24.549
fashioned road map.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.301
>> Not mapping.
>> I'm not good at reading maps.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.595
Korey: Girls are
with me, boys are with dad.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.097
>> And we've got
the maps but I'm not helping

06:30.139 --> 06:31.932
and mom's not helping
so ya'll got to figure it out.

06:31.974 --> 06:32.974
>> Nope you got to do
it all yourselves.

06:33.017 --> 06:33.892
>> But how do we-

06:33.935 --> 06:35.769
>> By reading the map.
[grunts]

06:35.812 --> 06:37.104
>> And ya'll have
to lead the way,

06:37.146 --> 06:38.438
you are the guides.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.065
>> But how are we supposed to-
>> Find out how to get

06:40.108 --> 06:42.317
there by reading the map.
>> I'm not helping neither.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.110
>> But-
>> We're not going

06:43.152 --> 06:44.319
to help you at all.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.821
I think going without
technology is going to

06:45.863 --> 06:46.905
be tough for the kids.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.698
>> And they're
terrible map readers.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.743
>> These kids have
never even see an atlas.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.413
They have no idea
how to read a map.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.915
>> What even is this?
>> What even is this?

06:56.958 --> 06:58.083
>> It's like Spanish
or something-

06:58.126 --> 06:59.167
>> Figure it out!

06:59.210 --> 07:00.669
>> It's not Spanish,
it's in English.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.712
Korie, your whole
sense of direction's based

07:02.755 --> 07:05.424
on the mall way or the
Shreveport Way.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.675
>> That's true.

07:06.717 --> 07:07.592
>> Like once you
past the mall you don't

07:07.635 --> 07:08.760
have a clue where
you're at.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.845
>> That's true.
>> All right, ya'll ready!

07:09.887 --> 07:12.180
First one to get
there wins a prize!

07:12.223 --> 07:14.266
>> What? It's not a race!
>> It's always a race.

07:14.308 --> 07:15.600
>> Is the prize our phones?

07:15.643 --> 07:18.478
>> Probably not.
There's really no prize.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.813
>> Willlie!

07:19.856 --> 07:21.523
>> I was just giving
them some motivation,

07:21.566 --> 07:23.024
they'll forget about it.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.944
>> Their prize will
be time together.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.322
>> Certainly won't
be a cell phone.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.699
>> All right are
we getting close?

07:30.741 --> 07:32.826
>> You're going to
take a right around the corner.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.578
>> A right up here?
>> Yeah.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.371
>> You're actually
doing better than I expected.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.248
>> Doing better
than I expected of myself.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.583
>> I don't see the
boys behind us.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.501
>> You don't?
>> Mmm-mmm

07:41.544 --> 07:43.003
>> They must've got lost.
>> Oh no.

07:43.045 --> 07:46.214
>> Dad, there's so

16:00.960 --> 16:02.585
So kids, this is
fun isn't it?

16:02.628 --> 16:03.544
>> It's a blast!

16:03.587 --> 16:05.171
>> Who needs
cell phones right?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.674
>> Yeah.
>> Woo-hoo!

16:07.716 --> 16:09.842
>> Ya'll catching any, guys?
>> Nope.

16:09.885 --> 16:14.764
>> This is kind of impossible.
>> Nobody wants this... bait.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.183
>> I haven't even had a nibble.
>> Where are all the fish?

16:17.226 --> 16:18.768
>> No fish want this bait.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.980
>> Oh I got one, I got one!
[celebrating]

16:22.022 --> 16:24.065
>> Look how little!

16:24.108 --> 16:26.025
>> Until we caught
our first fish, it was

16:26.068 --> 16:27.360
starting to look
like our tech time

16:27.403 --> 16:29.445
out was going to be
a tech wipe out.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.114
>> Got one!
>> You did?

16:31.156 --> 16:33.324
>> Look, I got one!
>> Oh John Luke caught one!

16:33.367 --> 16:35.076
>> Oh good one John Luke!

16:35.119 --> 16:37.036
>> I'm glad I was
able to teach my kids

16:37.079 --> 16:38.997
that you can have
fun without your phone.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.289
>> Oh!

16:40.332 --> 16:41.666
>> Rowdy you got something?
>> Yeah I got one!

16:41.709 --> 16:42.875
>> He got one?
>> Oh!

16:42.918 --> 16:43.292
>> Holy cow!
>> Oh god!

16:43.335 --> 16:45.461
>> Wow!

16:45.504 --> 16:47.630
>> Today we all learned
that catching a fish is a

16:47.673 --> 16:50.383
lot more satisfying
than catching a pokemon.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.928
>> Wow!
>> Oh yeah!

16:53.971 --> 16:56.097
>> Look at this sucker!
Unless we're talking

16:56.140 --> 16:59.350
about Snorlax because
he's super rare.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.352
Korie, we got to
take a picture of this!

17:01.395 --> 17:03.563
>> But we don't have
our phones!

17:03.605 --> 17:05.565
>> This is why we
need our phones!

17:05.607 --> 17:06.357
>> We probably
should have kept

17:06.400 --> 17:07.734
at least one phone.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.444
>> We can take a mental picture.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.236
>> I'm going to get
this guy to take a

17:10.279 --> 17:11.487
picture of this fish!

17:11.530 --> 17:13.656
>> Okay, yeah we got
to document that!

17:13.699 --> 17:15.908
>> Hey bro can you take a
picture of this fish!

17:15.951 --> 17:17.285
>> Yeah!

17:17.327 --> 17:19.746
>> Dad you can do that,
that's against the rules.

17:19.788 --> 17:20.955
>> Is there an exception.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.249
>> I got to admit,
the whole tech time out,

17:23.292 --> 17:25.543
turned into a pretty
good lesson, and not

17:25.586 --> 17:26.794
just for my kids.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.422
>> Got it!

17:29.465 --> 17:30.131
>> All right im going
to give you my number,

17:30.174 --> 17:31.340
send it to me.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.508
I appreciate it bud.
I thought they were the

17:32.551 --> 17:34.427
only ones attached to
their electronics.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.678
Hey let me see the picture!

17:35.721 --> 17:38.681
Before I realized,
I was guilty as well.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.477
Aw thats awesome!
Oh crap!

17:42.519 --> 17:44.020
>> What?
>> LSU's losing.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.313
>> Oh my goodness.

17:45.355 --> 17:47.231
>> But when it comes
to LSU playing,

17:47.274 --> 17:50.943
the tiger trumps no tech.
Any day of the week.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.945
>> All right,
I think we all got the

17:52.988 --> 17:54.322
point of tech week.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.616
I think we should end it,
we all understand,

17:56.658 --> 17:57.742
we had fun without it.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.534
>> Kids, did everybody
learn their lesson

17:58.577 --> 17:59.577
about cell phones?

17:59.620 --> 18:00.703
[all together]
>> Yes sir

18:00.746 --> 18:01.913
>> All right then
ya'll get your cell

18:01.955 --> 18:03.915
phones back!
>> Finally!

18:03.957 --> 18:04.749
But ya'll still need
to figure out how

18:04.792 --> 18:05.708
to get us
back home.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.502
>> Aw man!
>> That stinks.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.837
[rock music]

18:19.848 --> 18:20.765
>> When I'm in the
grocery store

18:20.808 --> 18:22.266
and people get
next to me,

18:22.309 --> 18:24.352
I can tell they're
smelling my hair.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.104
>> The chunks were
the worst part.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.774
>> I know, you got
to get that recipe.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.944
>> You're sick!
>> That was good!

18:32.986 --> 18:33.986
>> I don't even
want to think about it.

18:34.029 --> 18:34.904
Nope, nope.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.656
>> How do you feel, Si?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.451
>> Ya'll are sadistic!

18:41.078 --> 18:42.995
Hey Ill tell you what's
worse than having lice.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.997
It's being in a
stupid space suit.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.251
>> Hey all you had
to do was cut your hair

18:48.293 --> 18:50.711
>> Look hey, I told
ya'll I had it before.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.004
>> No.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.881
>> They got me in
the suit, like a caged animal,

18:53.924 --> 18:56.217
drinking tea through
a small straw.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.219
But it's a small price
to pay not to

18:58.262 --> 19:00.012
smell like you've been
pulled through

19:00.055 --> 19:01.347
a toilet backwards.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.100
>> Look, Si, take
the treatment,

19:04.143 --> 19:07.478
get your hair cut off,
or just one time say,

19:07.521 --> 19:09.272
Luke I am your father

19:09.314 --> 19:12.400
>> Luke, I'm your father.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.193
[laughing]

19:14.236 --> 19:16.154
Look but I am
wondering one thing,

19:16.196 --> 19:17.488
why do they make
these suits out of

19:17.531 --> 19:20.158
such a itchy material?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.159
So I can come
out of this-

19:21.201 --> 19:22.493
[all together]
>> No!

19:22.536 --> 19:24.662
>> No!
>>No!

19:26.665 --> 19:29.333
>> Oh no!

19:29.376 --> 19:30.585
>> What's up with that?

19:30.627 --> 19:32.211
>> Where'd you find
the hat there, fat boy!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.421
>> I found it outside!

19:33.463 --> 19:34.964
>> Did you not
check your phone?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.632
>> I'm off the grid,
I have no phone.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.384
>> You didn't get
any of the emails?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.261
>> No it's been quite
enjoyable.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.306
I've been living life,
off the grid.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.058
>> You've been living life?
>> Take that off.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.268
>> Well guess what!

19:47.311 --> 19:48.269
>> You're going to
be doing a lot of this.

19:48.312 --> 19:52.106
>> That hat you got,
is infected.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.692
>> You got lice bro.
>> Lice.

19:56.737 --> 19:59.238
[lauighing]

19:59.281 --> 20:01.866
>> God!
>> You got lice bro!

20:01.909 --> 20:03.242
>> I just had lice!

20:03.285 --> 20:04.952
>> Take the hat!

20:04.995 --> 20:06.662
>> Hey ya'll better
leave cause I'm coming

20:06.705 --> 20:07.997
out of this puppy.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.749
>> No. No. No.
We had a deal,

20:09.791 --> 20:11.209
we had a deal!

20:11.251 --> 20:13.753
>> Don't!
>> I'm out of here!

20:14.421 --> 20:16.380
Si: Godwin, you can't
get infected.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.257
Martin: Somebody burn
taht hat.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.094
>> Good grief!
I'm going to have to

20:22.137 --> 20:25.681
teach these guys some
respect for their elders!

20:25.724 --> 20:27.225
>> Father we're so
thankful to be in

20:27.267 --> 20:29.101
your presence, we're
so thankful for this family,

20:29.144 --> 20:30.561
all the blessings
you've given us, Father

20:30.604 --> 20:32.563
Thank you for
keeping us safe,

20:32.606 --> 20:34.482
thank you so much
for this food, and all the

20:34.524 --> 20:36.901
many blessings that
you've showered upon us.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.527
Through Jesus we pray,
amen.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.654
[all together]
>> Amen!

20:39.696 --> 20:41.113
>> All right let's
get on these

20:41.156 --> 20:42.740
stash potatoes
here!

20:42.783 --> 20:43.991
Willie: We're often
faced with things that

20:44.034 --> 20:46.619
irritate us in life,
whether it's our families

20:46.662 --> 20:49.997
over use of technology
or an outbreak of lice.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.916
But if you sit back
and ignore the problem,

20:51.959 --> 20:54.210
it's only going to
get worse, you have to

20:54.253 --> 20:57.588
face things head on,
and when it comes to lice.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.300
Smelly, gross, goop
covered head on.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.844
The most important thing
is that you lean

21:03.887 --> 21:05.930
on each other to overcome
these problems.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.015
Unless you have
lice, in that case,

21:08.058 --> 21:09.100
you probably should
not be leaning on

21:09.142 --> 21:11.686
anyone or anything.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.480
>> Hey Memaw, you added extra
garlic to the potatoes.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.815
>> Nope, that would
be me.
