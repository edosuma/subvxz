WEBVTT

00:10.214 --> 00:12.389
You know what I like about people?

00:12.450 --> 00:14.052
They stack so well.

00:16.178 --> 00:18.014
Let me get this for you.

00:20.391 --> 00:21.935
- Want the paper?
- No.

00:25.104 --> 00:26.062
This is too much.

00:26.113 --> 00:26.886
It's not half enough.

00:26.937 --> 00:27.953
Thanks for opening up for me.

00:28.073 --> 00:30.454
Any time, day or night.
You know that.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.612
In a town where everyone's

00:32.613 --> 00:34.363
so carefully reinventing themselves,

00:34.364 --> 00:35.698
what I like about Freddy

00:35.699 --> 00:38.785
is that he doesn't even
pretend to change.

00:38.786 --> 00:40.745
Ooh. I'm late.

00:40.746 --> 00:41.955
Every Tuesday I sit down

00:41.956 --> 00:43.957
with the speaker and the majority leader

00:43.958 --> 00:45.541
to discuss the week's agenda.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.877
Well, discuss is probably
the wrong word.

00:47.878 --> 00:49.712
They talk while I sit quietly

00:49.713 --> 00:51.672
and imaging their lightly salted faces

00:51.673 --> 00:53.173
frying in a skillet.

02:32.231 --> 02:34.400
Vasquez must be shitting herself.

02:34.401 --> 02:36.652
Shitting herself,
or Walker is shitting himself

02:36.653 --> 02:38.738
and shoveling his shit on her shit.

02:38.739 --> 02:40.280
Bob, I'm planning on eating.

02:40.281 --> 02:41.574
Do we have a backup on the docket?

02:41.575 --> 02:42.992
You're on that, right, Frank?

02:42.993 --> 02:44.243
Yeah, I'm working
with my staff--

02:44.244 --> 02:45.578
Republicans are gonna ram this

02:45.579 --> 02:47.413
up our ass.
I would if I was them.

02:47.414 --> 02:48.915
Why, even if we squeak it
through the house,

02:48.916 --> 02:50.750
watch them mangle it in the senate.

02:50.751 --> 02:52.376
- Or filibuster.
- Why, sure, if it looks anything like this.

02:52.377 --> 02:53.836
I don't know why Walker's

02:53.837 --> 02:55.796
trying to tackle a charging elephant.

02:55.797 --> 02:57.048
It's madness.

02:57.049 --> 02:58.716
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,

02:58.717 --> 03:00.300
but I saw you
sitting over here--

03:00.301 --> 03:02.136
Remy. Gentlemen,
this is Remy Danton.

03:02.137 --> 03:04.013
Remy, this is Speaker
Birch and Congress--

03:04.014 --> 03:06.057
I'm well aware.
Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

03:06.058 --> 03:08.350
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

03:08.351 --> 03:10.477
Glendon Hill?
Great team over there.

03:10.478 --> 03:12.063
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:12.064 --> 03:13.814
When was the last time
they added a partner?

03:13.815 --> 03:15.315
It's been a while.

03:15.316 --> 03:16.984
Well, they know a winner
when they see one.

03:16.985 --> 03:18.861
Remy was the best press
secretary I ever had.

03:18.862 --> 03:20.529
Why did you let him go?

03:20.530 --> 03:22.782
I didn't.
They stole him away.

03:22.783 --> 03:24.200
What accounts do you have?

03:24.201 --> 03:26.202
San Corp Industries is my main one.

03:26.203 --> 03:27.954
I run that account now.

03:27.955 --> 03:29.622
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.

03:29.623 --> 03:30.623
Sorry again to interrupt.

03:30.624 --> 03:31.707
No problem.

03:31.708 --> 03:33.834
Very nice to meet you both.

03:33.835 --> 03:36.670
- Nice.
- Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.

03:36.671 --> 03:39.298
He's probably making more
than all of us combined.

03:39.299 --> 03:40.633
Gentlemen, this one's on me.

03:40.634 --> 03:42.468
I'm gonna track down that check.

03:42.469 --> 03:45.179
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.973
San Corp is deep into natural gas.

03:46.974 --> 03:48.933
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,

03:48.934 --> 03:50.476
but I have 67 deputy whips,

03:50.477 --> 03:52.645
and they all need cash to win races.

03:52.646 --> 03:54.730
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,

03:54.731 --> 03:56.356
and in return they expect mine.

03:56.357 --> 03:57.733
It's degrading, I know,

03:57.734 --> 03:59.110
but when the tit's that big,

03:59.111 --> 04:00.319
everybody gets in line.

04:04.115 --> 04:05.699
Tell them I'm on top of it.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.201
I need more than that.

04:07.202 --> 04:09.703
You are well aware
that I do not drop the ball

04:09.704 --> 04:11.038
on things like this, Remy.

04:11.039 --> 04:13.415
Promises, Frank.
Secretary of State,

04:13.416 --> 04:14.792
Argentine and offshore
drilling contracts--

04:14.793 --> 04:16.752
talk to me when I've solved the problem.

04:16.753 --> 04:18.587
Don't waste my time when I'm
working on solving the problem.

04:18.588 --> 04:19.713
When there's billions on the line,

04:19.714 --> 04:20.964
I can't not show up.

04:20.966 --> 04:22.382
Fine. Thank you
for your diligence.

04:22.383 --> 04:24.260
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.

04:24.261 --> 04:27.096
6 million to build that library
of yours in your name.

04:27.097 --> 04:29.348
- I know.
- Don't make them throw money

04:29.349 --> 04:31.017
at your challenger next cycle.

04:31.018 --> 04:32.518
You've made your point.

04:32.519 --> 04:35.229
Have I? I hope so.

04:38.482 --> 04:40.609
Such a waste of talent.

04:40.610 --> 04:42.987
He chose money over power--

04:42.988 --> 04:45.614
In this town, a mistake
nearly everyone makes.

04:45.615 --> 04:48.534
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota

04:48.535 --> 04:50.786
that starts falling apart
after ten years.

04:50.787 --> 04:53.706
Power is the old stone building

04:53.707 --> 04:56.334
that stands for centuries.

04:56.335 --> 04:59.670
I cannot respect someone
who doesn't see the difference.

05:01.547 --> 05:03.007
What am I looking at?

05:03.008 --> 05:04.258
The Williams register.

05:04.259 --> 05:05.634
- Williams?
- College.

05:05.635 --> 05:06.844
September '78.

05:06.845 --> 05:08.304
And why am I looking at it?

05:08.305 --> 05:09.596
The editorial.

05:14.852 --> 05:16.229
Not that interesting.

05:16.230 --> 05:18.480
Michael Kern went to Williams.

05:18.481 --> 05:20.149
Check out the masthead.

05:22.568 --> 05:24.611
And then there's this.

05:26.572 --> 05:28.032
It's thin.

05:28.033 --> 05:30.243
The guy's a unicorn.
He pisses rainbows.

05:30.244 --> 05:32.119
- You think we can get traction with this?
- I think you could.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.579
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

05:33.580 --> 05:36.456
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.

05:36.457 --> 05:38.167
It's only 6 past 9:00.

05:38.168 --> 05:40.086
Which means she read
the Herald 3 hours ago

05:40.087 --> 05:42.755
and spent the past 2 1/2 getting
reamed by the president.

05:42.756 --> 05:44.715
Tell her I'm on my way.

05:44.716 --> 05:46.967
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me that you--

05:46.968 --> 05:49.720
25 years he's been pushing
this particular agenda.

05:49.721 --> 05:51.722
We got between the
mother bear and her cub.

05:51.723 --> 05:53.307
It's a setback.
That's all.

05:53.308 --> 05:54.892
On our first day in office.

05:54.893 --> 05:56.685
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.

05:56.686 --> 05:58.687
Setbacks are a dime a dozen
with a bill of this size.

05:58.688 --> 06:00.438
Frank, if you
can't control this--

06:00.439 --> 06:02.358
I don't take well to being
micromanaged, Linda.

06:02.359 --> 06:05.152
You want to do my job for
me and run the White House?

06:05.153 --> 06:07.238
Good luck.
I won't stand in your way.

06:07.239 --> 06:10.574
Okay, Frank. Fine.
This is yours now.

06:10.575 --> 06:13.577
If this thing can't make it to
the floor in the first 100 days,

06:13.578 --> 06:15.162
then I'll let you explain
to the president

06:15.163 --> 06:16.705
why he lied to the American people.

06:16.706 --> 06:18.207
I'm gonna get back to work.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.625
Please do.

06:38.644 --> 06:40.980
Well, we really should be
doing this on a Friday

06:40.981 --> 06:42.148
instead of a Wednesday.

06:42.149 --> 06:43.983
If we do it on a Friday,

06:43.984 --> 06:46.319
- people have the weekend--
- Fine. We'll do it on Friday.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.820
Is all the paperwork ready?

06:47.821 --> 06:50.114
Some of the more senior
people are trickier.

06:50.115 --> 06:51.782
There's severance.

06:51.783 --> 06:53.367
But we shouldn't run into
any legal issues.

06:53.368 --> 06:57.204
No, no. We use at-will
employment contracts

06:57.205 --> 06:58.496
across the board.

06:58.497 --> 07:00.291
Well, get started first thing Friday.

07:00.292 --> 07:03.377
I want all of the exit interviews

07:03.378 --> 07:04.670
done by lunch.

07:04.671 --> 07:06.839
Claire, I just can't help but think

07:06.840 --> 07:08.424
that this is a mistake.

07:08.425 --> 07:10.134
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.

07:10.135 --> 07:12.303
I know, I know,
but I just have to say it

07:12.304 --> 07:14.263
for the sake of my conscience.

07:14.264 --> 07:17.308
I think that you are dismantling

07:17.309 --> 07:20.144
what we have built
over the past ten years,

07:20.145 --> 07:21.354
and I--

07:27.734 --> 07:30.863
and I think the way you're handling this

07:30.864 --> 07:34.450
is...is cruel.

07:34.451 --> 07:35.951
It's not easy, Evelyn.

07:37.370 --> 07:38.954
But it's necessary.

07:38.955 --> 07:42.500
You have always asked me
to be honest with you.

07:42.501 --> 07:44.210
It's how we work together.

07:44.211 --> 07:46.586
I disagree with something, I say it.

07:46.587 --> 07:49.923
Well, I disagree 100%.

07:49.924 --> 07:52.551
Please, Claire, don't do this.

07:52.552 --> 07:54.845
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,

07:54.846 --> 07:56.972
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,

07:56.973 --> 07:59.808
but I'm not going to change my mind.

08:02.602 --> 08:03.729
Friday, then.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.983
If that's what you want.

08:15.533 --> 08:18.369
This is major reform,
a complete overhaul.

08:18.370 --> 08:20.454
That would usually take months.

08:20.455 --> 08:22.373
Well, we only have days, not months.

08:22.374 --> 08:23.957
But think about the process.
We can't just change--

08:23.958 --> 08:27.253
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,

08:27.254 --> 08:30.130
who are the smartest minds in education,

08:30.131 --> 08:32.966
out of hundreds,
we arrived at you--

08:32.967 --> 08:34.967
the six of you in this room.

08:34.969 --> 08:36.761
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,

08:36.763 --> 08:39.765
but we have the opportunity
to make history here.

08:39.765 --> 08:43.684
And I want all of us
to make it together.

08:43.686 --> 08:46.146
So good luck.
We're counting on you.

08:47.647 --> 08:48.732
Page 1.

08:48.733 --> 08:49.983
These bullet points

08:49.984 --> 08:51.402
reflect the key planks

08:51.403 --> 08:53.112
at the center of our bill.

08:53.113 --> 08:54.988
Get comfy.
This is your home

08:54.989 --> 08:56.698
until we have a presentable first draft.

09:00.202 --> 09:02.162
Donald, what a morning.

09:02.163 --> 09:03.914
I have no idea how they got this.

09:03.915 --> 09:05.374
I specifically told my staff

09:05.375 --> 09:07.000
to destroy everything.
I can't imagine--

09:07.001 --> 09:08.627
It doesn't matter how it happened.

09:08.628 --> 09:10.796
We can't make it unhappen,
so we have to adapt.

09:10.797 --> 09:12.881
Don't they realize
that this is a first draft?

09:12.882 --> 09:14.716
All we have here really
is a perception problem.

09:14.717 --> 09:17.303
We don't get a second chance
at a first impression, Donald.

09:17.304 --> 09:19.972
You know that. Now,
look, I'm on your side,

09:19.973 --> 09:22.182
but Linda is furious.

09:22.183 --> 09:23.642
What's she saying?

09:23.643 --> 09:25.603
They want to point fingers.

09:25.604 --> 09:26.770
At me?

09:26.771 --> 09:28.355
I told her we cannot do that.

09:28.356 --> 09:30.232
I mean, you are vital to this process.

09:30.233 --> 09:32.859
I'm up to here with them,
Donald--

09:32.860 --> 09:35.946
for lying, for turning
their back on you.

09:35.947 --> 09:38.449
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.

09:38.450 --> 09:40.493
I'll fall on this grenade myself,

09:40.494 --> 09:42.744
just to piss them off.

09:42.745 --> 09:44.455
Give me John king at CNN.

09:44.456 --> 09:46.165
Wait, Frank.
This is not your fault.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.208
No, we have to protect your reputation.

09:48.209 --> 09:50.127
But you're the man that needs to
get the bill through the house.

09:50.128 --> 09:52.921
I will-- hang on.
I will assign it to one of my deputies,

09:52.922 --> 09:55.174
quietly manage it, and help
guide you through the process.

09:55.175 --> 09:56.883
I am not comfortable with this.

09:56.884 --> 09:59.553
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

10:01.389 --> 10:03.807
What a martyr craves more than anything

10:03.808 --> 10:05.309
is a sword to fall on,

10:05.310 --> 10:07.102
so you sharpen the blade,

10:07.103 --> 10:08.854
hold it at just the right angle,

10:08.855 --> 10:11.649
and then 3, 2, 1--

10:11.650 --> 10:12.774
It should be me.

10:12.775 --> 10:14.026
It was my bill.

10:14.027 --> 10:15.569
No. Impossible. Donald,

10:15.570 --> 10:18.780
education has been your life's work.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.411
The truth is my heart
is not in this fight.

10:24.412 --> 10:27.414
You know me. I'm not
a wheeler dealer.

10:27.415 --> 10:29.082
I can put my mind to policy,

10:29.083 --> 10:31.835
but I'm no good at this
brand of politics.

10:31.836 --> 10:34.421
Well, if not you, then who?

10:39.843 --> 10:42.054
It should be you, Frank.

10:42.055 --> 10:44.431
You're formidable.
People respect you.

10:44.432 --> 10:46.350
They will follow your lead.
Let me--

10:46.351 --> 10:48.268
let me be on the sidelines for this.

10:52.648 --> 10:55.108
Well, I could only
consider that as an option

10:55.109 --> 10:59.363
if I knew that I could still
come to you for counsel.

10:59.364 --> 11:02.616
Of course.
Whatever you need.

11:04.452 --> 11:08.121
Part of me is glad this got leaked.

11:09.956 --> 11:11.958
Well, it would have been
better if it hadn't,

11:11.959 --> 11:15.337
but at least people know where I stand.

11:17.297 --> 11:18.424
Thank you, Donald.

11:18.425 --> 11:20.050
Happy to do it, Frank.

11:26.599 --> 11:29.184
He has no idea we've got
six kids in the next room

11:29.185 --> 11:30.603
already working on a new draft.

11:30.604 --> 11:33.105
Stamper! But why dampen
his mood by telling him?

11:33.106 --> 11:34.607
We just gave him
a great gift--

11:34.608 --> 11:36.567
a chance to fulfill his destiny.

11:36.568 --> 11:38.402
Write up a statement
for Blythe--

11:38.403 --> 11:40.028
stepping aside, fresh ideas,

11:40.029 --> 11:41.947
et cetera, et cetera,
and make it dignified.

11:41.948 --> 11:43.198
He's a good man.

11:43.199 --> 11:45.743
Oh. And bring me
that Williams editorial.

11:49.705 --> 11:52.708
After careful thought
and discussion with my staff,

11:52.709 --> 11:54.876
I am relinquishing my management

11:54.877 --> 11:56.336
of the education reform act.

11:56.337 --> 11:58.464
I hope to remain a part of the process,

11:58.465 --> 11:59.506
but I won't be working--

11:59.507 --> 12:00.924
Why did you leak the draft?

12:00.925 --> 12:03.093
I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,

12:03.094 --> 12:05.053
but, uh,
it does represent--

12:05.054 --> 12:06.804
it came from your office,
though, correct?

12:06.805 --> 12:08.307
Uh, we wrote it,
but I don't--

12:08.308 --> 12:09.891
Who'll be managing the bill now?

12:09.892 --> 12:10.892
Frank Underwood.

12:10.893 --> 12:12.269
Was that your choice,

12:12.270 --> 12:13.604
or did
the administration--

12:13.605 --> 12:14.647
I feel very confident

12:14.648 --> 12:15.773
placing the bill

12:15.774 --> 12:17.190
in Frank's capable hands.

12:55.228 --> 12:56.438
Ms. Barnes.

12:56.439 --> 12:58.106
How very deep throat of you.

12:58.107 --> 13:01.026
Well, I can't help you
dispatch a president.

13:01.027 --> 13:02.444
How about a senator?

13:02.445 --> 13:04.279
The editorial on the Camp David accords.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.573
"It is the opinion of this newspaper

13:06.574 --> 13:08.701
"that President Carter demand Israel

13:08.702 --> 13:10.202
"withdraw all its citizens

13:10.203 --> 13:11.829
from the Gaza Strip
and West Bank."

13:11.830 --> 13:14.790
"Which it has illegally
occupied since 1967."

13:14.791 --> 13:16.750
Illegally occupied.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.210
That's quite an incendiary
quote, don't you think?

13:18.211 --> 13:19.961
For an administration that says

13:19.962 --> 13:22.381
that the Middle East is its
top foreign policy priority.

13:22.382 --> 13:23.674
Michael Kern?

13:23.675 --> 13:25.967
Did he personally write the editorial?

13:25.968 --> 13:27.885
He was the editor.

13:27.886 --> 13:29.638
But did he write it himself?

13:31.598 --> 13:33.392
Then there's no story.

13:33.393 --> 13:36.894
I'm saying it's a question worth asking.

13:36.895 --> 13:38.856
And if he denies involvement?

13:38.857 --> 13:40.399
He will. Let him.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.609
This is a man trying to be confirmed

13:42.610 --> 13:44.236
as Secretary of State.

13:44.237 --> 13:45.945
Everything is a story.

13:45.946 --> 13:47.364
There's no direct link.

13:47.365 --> 13:50.908
I can't get this past Messerschmidt.

13:50.909 --> 13:54.621
Remember this moment
when you resisted me,

13:54.622 --> 13:58.876
when you said the words
"Then there is no story."

14:00.586 --> 14:02.796
Get a good night's
sleep, Ms. Barnes.

14:02.797 --> 14:04.798
You have a big day tomorrow.

14:27.654 --> 14:28.906
Francis?

14:39.750 --> 14:42.502
What is this?

14:42.503 --> 14:43.587
What does it look like?

14:43.588 --> 14:45.338
But the basement is mine.

14:45.339 --> 14:47.800
I know. It's not for me.

14:47.801 --> 14:49.050
So who's it for?

14:49.051 --> 14:50.260
For you.

14:50.261 --> 14:52.011
There's a gym in the Capitol.

14:52.012 --> 14:53.430
Which you never use.

14:53.431 --> 14:55.474
Because I'm a tad busy
running the country.

14:55.475 --> 14:57.684
But not at home, so now
you have no excuse.

14:57.685 --> 14:58.852
I want it out.

14:58.853 --> 15:00.228
Give it a try first.

15:00.229 --> 15:01.438
Is this your subtle way

15:01.439 --> 15:04.149
of saying that I'm out of shape?

15:04.150 --> 15:05.484
No, it's my way of suggesting

15:05.485 --> 15:07.068
you could be in better shape.

15:07.069 --> 15:08.904
That sounds
both passive-aggressive

15:08.905 --> 15:10.322
and condescending.

15:10.323 --> 15:11.448
Just plain aggressive and true.

15:11.449 --> 15:12.866
Don't wait up for me.

15:12.867 --> 15:14.326
Are you going running now?

15:15.577 --> 15:16.995
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.

15:16.996 --> 15:18.371
I had an early meeting.

15:18.372 --> 15:21.124
Use the monstrosity.
It's freezing out.

15:21.125 --> 15:22.918
You break it in.

15:25.879 --> 15:28.465
It looks positively
medieval, doesn't it?

15:28.466 --> 15:31.510
And to turn my only sanctuary
into a fitness dungeon.

15:31.511 --> 15:32.845
I won't have it.

15:34.012 --> 15:35.305
It's a stretch.

15:35.306 --> 15:37.056
We're not misleading anyone.

15:37.057 --> 15:39.184
- He was the editor.
- Did you call for a comment?

15:39.185 --> 15:41.311
I tried three times. The press
secretary said he'd get back to me.

15:41.312 --> 15:43.313
- He didn't.
- What about research?

15:43.314 --> 15:44.982
You couldn't find anything
to echo the editorial?

15:44.983 --> 15:46.525
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?

15:46.526 --> 15:48.276
Don't you think if something
like that existed,

15:48.277 --> 15:49.987
someone would have printed it by now?

15:49.988 --> 15:51.404
Nobody else has this, Lucas.

15:51.405 --> 15:53.156
I don't think there's a story here.

15:53.157 --> 15:55.033
I'm not saying there's a story.
All I'm saying

15:55.034 --> 15:57.160
is that there's a question
that needs to be answered.

15:58.578 --> 16:00.873
This is a nominee
for Secretary of State.

16:00.874 --> 16:03.124
We have an editorial
on Palestine and Israel.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.543
Which he didn't write.

16:04.544 --> 16:06.545
Which we don't know he didn't write.

16:06.546 --> 16:08.005
Exactly.

16:08.006 --> 16:09.214
We don't have to print it.

16:09.215 --> 16:10.549
I could just scan the thing,

16:10.550 --> 16:12.258
stick it on a site, and tweet the link.

16:12.259 --> 16:13.802
But if I did that,
some other paper might--

16:13.803 --> 16:16.179
Whoa, whoa.
Don't be a bitch.

16:17.890 --> 16:19.057
I'll talk to Tom.

16:19.058 --> 16:20.934
That's all I was asking.

16:20.935 --> 16:22.811
We simply can't afford
to allow the--

16:22.812 --> 16:24.354
We got a guy who's almost perfect.

16:24.355 --> 16:26.398
He's a libertarian drug fiend

16:26.399 --> 16:27.941
- marinating in a mobile home.
- Shh.

16:27.942 --> 16:29.693
I didn't agree with President Reagan

16:29.694 --> 16:30.903
on many things,

16:30.904 --> 16:32.362
but there was some merit

16:32.363 --> 16:33.989
to the notion
of trickle-down economics,

16:33.990 --> 16:35.532
and I feel there is much merit

16:35.533 --> 16:38.952
to the idea
of trickle-down diplomacy.

16:38.953 --> 16:40.537
Those are my lines.

16:40.538 --> 16:42.121
Vasquez must have given them to him.

16:42.122 --> 16:43.999
...stalemate between
Israel and Palestine,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.793
that success will trickle down

16:46.794 --> 16:48.294
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas

16:48.295 --> 16:50.171
between Muslims,
Jews, Christians--

16:50.172 --> 16:52.007
I'm glad you brought up
Israel and Palestine

16:52.008 --> 16:53.759
because just before we came on the air,

16:53.760 --> 16:55.427
I received an advance copy of an article

16:55.428 --> 16:57.095
that's going to be in tomorrow's

16:57.096 --> 16:58.638
Washington Herald's front page

16:58.639 --> 17:00.390
and was written by Zoe Barnes,

17:00.391 --> 17:02.350
and in it she quotes an editorial

17:02.351 --> 17:04.352
that ran in the Williams
college register

17:04.353 --> 17:07.396
when you were editor
back in September 1978,

17:07.397 --> 17:08.773
which called the Israeli presence

17:08.775 --> 17:10.233
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,

17:10.233 --> 17:13.028
quote, an illegal occupation.

17:13.029 --> 17:14.863
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

17:14.864 --> 17:17.031
Did you write those words,
"illegal occupation"?

17:17.032 --> 17:18.992
No. I have
no memory of this.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.827
But you were the editor of the paper.

17:20.828 --> 17:22.287
Yes, but--

17:22.288 --> 17:23.663
So it couldn't have gone out

17:23.664 --> 17:24.957
without your approval.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.208
No, of course not,
but my staff--

17:27.209 --> 17:28.919
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,

17:28.920 --> 17:31.004
the, uh-- and then
we'd vote, and if--

17:31.005 --> 17:32.422
Did you vote for it?

17:32.423 --> 17:33.590
Honestly, George, I can't remember.

17:33.591 --> 17:34.758
It was 35 years ago.

17:34.759 --> 17:36.259
So you're not sure

17:36.260 --> 17:37.928
whether or not you
supported these words--

17:37.929 --> 17:39.888
I can tell you without
a shadow of a doubt

17:39.889 --> 17:41.765
I did not write these words.

17:41.766 --> 17:44.434
But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?

17:44.435 --> 17:47.020
This is ludicrous.

17:47.021 --> 17:49.481
That's all we need--
him laughing.

17:49.482 --> 17:51.232
I know it was
a long time ago--

17:51.233 --> 17:52.901
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

17:52.902 --> 17:55.445
The Middle East is a vital
American interest.

17:55.446 --> 17:57.489
What you think about
the Middle East is relevant.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.699
You can look at my voting record.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.285
Every single vote has been
in defense of Israel--

18:02.286 --> 18:04.287
So when did your views change?

18:04.288 --> 18:05.622
What I'm saying to you
is my--

18:05.623 --> 18:06.790
What's important now, George,

18:06.791 --> 18:08.541
is how I have voted

18:08.542 --> 18:10.710
while I have represented
the great state of Colorado--

18:10.711 --> 18:12.754
I understand that's your position,
but a lot of other people

18:12.755 --> 18:14.339
are going to look at it
and think what you thought then

18:14.340 --> 18:15.632
is relevant as well.

18:15.633 --> 18:17.216
Have you ever changed your views

18:17.217 --> 18:19.302
- since college?
- I'm not the nominee

18:19.303 --> 18:20.637
for Secretary of State.

18:20.638 --> 18:22.973
Uh,
even if I did have--

18:22.974 --> 18:24.265
It's golden.

18:24.266 --> 18:25.558
This has not been my views--

18:25.559 --> 18:26.977
It's a bull's eye.

18:26.978 --> 18:29.021
What were you saying when you came in?

18:29.022 --> 18:31.773
So, ahem, I found a guy

18:31.774 --> 18:33.483
who was on the college editorial staff

18:33.484 --> 18:34.693
when Kern was there.

18:34.694 --> 18:36.028
This burnout,

18:36.029 --> 18:37.821
still pumping mimeographed manifestos

18:37.822 --> 18:39.489
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.

18:39.490 --> 18:41.158
You're not planning on talking to him.

18:41.159 --> 18:42.742
Peter Russo.

18:42.743 --> 18:44.703
Good.

18:44.704 --> 18:46.496
Sounds like a perfect match.

18:49.582 --> 18:51.626
Dennis.

18:51.627 --> 18:54.253
Any chance you're watching
Stephanopoulos?

19:03.722 --> 19:05.515
You look sexy when you're improving

19:05.516 --> 19:08.018
the lives of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

19:08.019 --> 19:09.352
Is it the improving lives,

19:09.353 --> 19:10.896
or is it these fetching sweat pants?

19:10.897 --> 19:13.023
Move that computer out of the way.

19:13.024 --> 19:14.774
Let me see what that looks like.

19:17.944 --> 19:19.445
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.

19:19.446 --> 19:21.114
Fuck off.

19:21.115 --> 19:22.657
You're not paying
enough attention to me.

19:22.658 --> 19:25.869
I pay attention to you
all day at the office.

19:27.704 --> 19:29.122
Hey, you know, I don't think

19:29.123 --> 19:30.916
I've ever seen you
brush your teeth before.

19:30.917 --> 19:32.584
- Sure you have.
- No, I don't think so.

19:32.585 --> 19:34.753
I know that you do brush,
but I don't think

19:34.754 --> 19:36.213
I've ever actually witnessed it before.

19:36.214 --> 19:38.215
Well, here it is in all its glory.

19:38.216 --> 19:40.008
Is that my toothbrush?

19:40.009 --> 19:41.134
I don't know. Is it?

19:41.135 --> 19:42.343
Yes, it is.

19:42.344 --> 19:44.179
- You left it here.
- Peter, gross.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.471
Oh, come on.

19:45.472 --> 19:47.515
We've exchanged plenty of fluids.

19:47.516 --> 19:50.560
Ohh. Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

19:50.561 --> 19:51.853
No. Toothpaste.

19:51.854 --> 19:54.355
It's not toothpaste.
I'm ravished.

19:54.356 --> 19:55.648
No.

19:55.649 --> 19:56.900
Mm.

19:59.112 --> 20:01.529
Go get it.

20:01.530 --> 20:04.365
- I have to take this.
- Ohh.

20:04.366 --> 20:06.701
This is Russo.

20:12.707 --> 20:16.544
Yeah.
Right now it's 12:53.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.719
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

20:28.473 --> 20:30.058
I have to go.

20:30.059 --> 20:31.643
Is everything okay?

20:31.644 --> 20:33.103
It's work stuff.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.687
What kind of work stuff?

20:34.688 --> 20:36.731
Congressman Wallinski.
He wants to go over

20:36.732 --> 20:39.442
the tax incentive stuff we sent him.

20:39.443 --> 20:40.902
Peter,
it's 1:00 in the morning.

20:42.571 --> 20:43.863
Hey, Peter.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.290
I have meetings tomorrow.
I have a committee hearing.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.750
Congress will survive without you.

20:55.751 --> 20:58.586
Address, directions.

20:58.587 --> 21:01.256
There's an e-ticket
in your name.

21:05.218 --> 21:07.137
Your flight leaves
at 6:30.

21:07.138 --> 21:09.681
- You should head to the airport.
- This is coming from Frank?

21:09.682 --> 21:11.891
No. This is coming
from no one.

21:11.892 --> 21:14.019
You have the flu,
and you're calling in sick.

21:15.187 --> 21:17.563
- What's that?
- What's what?

21:17.564 --> 21:20.233
Is that a hickey?

21:20.234 --> 21:22.027
Are you whoring around again?

21:22.028 --> 21:24.445
- No. I have a girlfriend.
- Mm.

21:24.446 --> 21:27.282
You mean your little office romance.

21:27.283 --> 21:29.159
What do you know about that?

21:29.160 --> 21:31.953
When it comes to your life,
Peter, and what I know about it,

21:31.954 --> 21:35.623
you should assume that there's
no such thing as a secret.

21:35.624 --> 21:37.500
Stay in touch.

21:37.501 --> 21:40.337
You call me on my cell,
never at the office.

21:41.629 --> 21:43.548
Good luck.

21:45.466 --> 21:47.719
Knock 'em dead, tiger.

22:05.029 --> 22:06.905
How are we?

22:06.906 --> 22:10.242
Overtired, under-caffeinated,
but we're making progress.

22:10.243 --> 22:13.161
- Less than a week to go.
- Yeah. We'll do our best.

22:13.162 --> 22:15.538
- You'll what?
- We'll get it done.

22:15.539 --> 22:18.250
Somebody open a window.
It's rancid in here.

22:18.251 --> 22:20.335
That is what happens when six people

22:20.336 --> 22:22.754
don't shower for half a week.

22:22.755 --> 22:24.505
Anything you need other than deodorant?

22:24.506 --> 22:26.258
Yeah, this performance standards thing.

22:26.259 --> 22:28.676
- The teachers unions are gonna--
- Leave it in.

22:28.677 --> 22:31.137
- But we could delete it.
- I'll handle the unions. What else? Anything?

22:31.138 --> 22:33.265
Conjugal visits?

22:33.266 --> 22:34.766
I'll get back to work.

22:37.518 --> 22:38.686
Nancy.

22:38.687 --> 22:40.855
- Coming.
- What do I have next?

22:40.856 --> 22:43.358
Constituent calls
from 2:10 to 2:35,

22:43.359 --> 22:46.194
- fundraising until 3:50, deputy caucus at 4:00.
- The call list?

22:46.195 --> 22:48.238
- It's on your desk.
- My briefing for the caucus?

22:48.239 --> 22:50.365
- Next to the call list.
- Have you been in the conference room?

22:50.366 --> 22:52.367
Have it steam cleaned over the weekend.

22:52.368 --> 22:54.493
In the meantime, get those poor
kids some Febreze or something.

22:54.494 --> 22:55.536
It's like a petting zoo.

22:56.914 --> 22:59.999
You gotta see this.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.002
But were they in line
with your thinking at the time?

23:04.504 --> 23:06.339
We do not consider the issue of Israel

23:06.340 --> 23:08.465
and Palestine a laughing matter.

23:08.466 --> 23:10.427
And he calls Israel illegal.

23:10.428 --> 23:13.054
Well, he's an anti-semite,
and he is wrong.

23:13.055 --> 23:15.432
We would have grave, grave concerns

23:15.433 --> 23:18.435
about appointing such a man
our next Secretary of State.

23:20.354 --> 23:23.106
It's too easy.

24:28.254 --> 24:30.507
Roy, hi.

24:30.508 --> 24:33.092
My name is Peter Russo.
Congressman Russo.

24:33.093 --> 24:36.471
I'd like to just
speak to you for just a...

24:36.472 --> 24:37.930
Sir?

24:37.931 --> 24:40.766
Either you're lying,
and you can fuck off;

24:40.767 --> 24:44.354
or you're telling the truth,
and you can absolutely fuck off.

24:44.355 --> 24:46.939
I saw your web site.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.067
I'm a fan.

24:51.027 --> 24:53.112
And I brought you something.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.876
Hey, babe, put some clothes on.

25:06.877 --> 25:08.878
- What?
- We got a guest.

25:08.879 --> 25:10.505
So? Hey.

25:10.506 --> 25:12.298
Put some clothes on.

25:13.716 --> 25:16.635
Ice or no ice?

25:16.636 --> 25:18.513
- Uh, no ice.
- Good.

25:18.514 --> 25:21.057
We don't have any.

25:27.439 --> 25:29.357
Fuck. Echo, I told you
to put the--

25:29.358 --> 25:32.110
It's okay. It's okay.

25:32.111 --> 25:35.029
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

25:35.988 --> 25:37.865
A congressman, you say?

25:37.866 --> 25:40.285
Right now,
I'm just a drinking companion.

25:40.286 --> 25:41.911
Well, all right, companion.

25:41.912 --> 25:43.620
Have yourself a drink.

25:56.593 --> 25:58.595
Come on in.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.196
$10,000.

26:17.197 --> 26:19.865
What will that get me?

26:19.866 --> 26:23.536
I mean, I'm kinky, but I don't know
if I'm the girl you're looking for.

26:23.537 --> 26:27.457
You're definitely the girl
that I'm looking for.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.919
Excuse me.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.380
All I want for that money
is your silence.

26:34.381 --> 26:36.257
My what?

26:36.258 --> 26:38.050
The guy you were with the other night,

26:38.051 --> 26:40.595
the one who was arrested,
do you know who he was?

26:41.513 --> 26:43.055
You mean the congressman?

26:43.056 --> 26:45.433
There was no congressman.
There was no arrest.

26:45.434 --> 26:47.143
None of that exists.

26:47.144 --> 26:48.978
All that exists

26:48.979 --> 26:51.272
is the money sitting right there
in front of you.

26:51.273 --> 26:53.525
Do you understand?

26:55.193 --> 26:56.693
Yeah.

26:57.612 --> 26:59.322
Good.

27:04.410 --> 27:05.870
Open your mouth.

27:23.095 --> 27:25.264
Last little bit's for me.

27:38.319 --> 27:40.446
You're scolding me.

27:41.406 --> 27:42.823
Am I?

27:42.824 --> 27:45.742
You are, silently.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.831
- Is it the rowing machine?
- You tell me.

27:50.832 --> 27:52.542
It's the rowing machine.

27:52.543 --> 27:55.503
- You haven't used it.
- How do you know I haven't?

27:55.504 --> 27:56.795
Francis.

27:56.796 --> 27:58.881
You know I don't like to be managed.

27:58.882 --> 28:01.008
I'm not trying to manage you.

28:01.009 --> 28:04.262
I just don't want
to outlive you by 25 years.

28:04.263 --> 28:06.598
I must walk three miles a day
around that Capitol.

28:06.599 --> 28:08.266
I'm constantly on my feet.

28:08.267 --> 28:11.269
And do you know how many
calories the brain burns?

28:11.270 --> 28:13.312
I'm not worried about your brain.

28:13.313 --> 28:16.773
It's your heart we're talking about.

28:19.152 --> 28:21.487
Use the machine.

28:25.032 --> 28:26.618
She's right.

28:26.619 --> 28:28.703
I should take better care of myself.

28:28.704 --> 28:30.288
But it's the principle.

28:30.289 --> 28:32.707
I won't be a slave
to anybody or anything

28:32.708 --> 28:35.918
you can order
with a toll-free number.

28:47.221 --> 28:49.807
We share the wealth in this republic.

28:57.399 --> 29:00.234
I thought the whole
editorial team pitched in.

29:00.235 --> 29:02.945
Sometimes.
Not that time, though.

29:02.946 --> 29:04.947
But he must have written some of it?

29:04.948 --> 29:08.951
No. That was all me.

29:10.579 --> 29:13.038
What if people thought he wrote it?

29:13.039 --> 29:15.166
Oh, fuck that.
He's a fraud.

29:15.167 --> 29:18.628
Nah, he's worse than a fraud.
He's a fucking farce.

29:18.629 --> 29:20.212
I'll tell you something.

29:20.213 --> 29:23.215
He used to be even more
of a maniac than I am.

29:23.216 --> 29:25.884
- Chemicals?
- No. Politics.

29:25.885 --> 29:28.387
Oh, we had some nights, man.
Long conversations,

29:28.388 --> 29:30.598
dangerous fucking notions.

29:30.599 --> 29:32.891
- Like what?
- You name it-- OPEC,

29:32.892 --> 29:35.478
Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.

29:35.479 --> 29:38.564
Then the motherland
sang her mating call.

29:38.565 --> 29:41.066
♪ O say can you-- ♪

29:41.067 --> 29:43.528
Next thing, he's cramming
for the bar at Bryn Mawr

29:43.529 --> 29:45.029
and snapping on a flag pin.

29:45.030 --> 29:47.072
Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?

29:47.073 --> 29:50.409
My point is, he started goose-stepping
in the marionette parade.

29:50.410 --> 29:52.953
Left, right; red, blue;
Democrat, Republican.

29:52.954 --> 29:55.540
We're all dangling
from the same strings.

29:55.541 --> 29:59.043
Take a sledgehammer to the whole
fucking Punch and Judy show.

29:59.044 --> 30:01.920
- That's what's required.
- Thought you were a patriot.

30:01.921 --> 30:03.881
Fuck, yeah.
One of the few.

30:03.882 --> 30:06.676
- So what's wrong with public service?
- Public service?

30:06.677 --> 30:09.846
Come on. You gotta get a grip
on who your masters are.

30:09.847 --> 30:14.308
The I.M.F., the World Bank,
the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

30:14.309 --> 30:17.228
You bankroll their fucking death squads.

30:17.229 --> 30:20.773
It's called FEMA;
it's called alcohol, tobacco, and firearms;

30:20.774 --> 30:22.692
NATO; Border Control.

30:22.693 --> 30:24.527
You think Katrina was incompetence?

30:24.528 --> 30:26.612
That was highly orchestrated negligence.

30:26.613 --> 30:30.241
Look at Waco, Amnesty
International, the A.C.L.U.

30:30.242 --> 30:33.661
Smokescreens-- all of them.
Blood on their hands.

30:33.662 --> 30:35.454
Well, exactly.

30:36.997 --> 30:38.999
You want me to lie to the people.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.919
I want you to spare the people
another hypocrite.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.547
What's in it for you?

30:44.548 --> 30:47.091
Poetic justice.

30:47.092 --> 30:49.594
Oh, come on.
You're one of them.

30:51.095 --> 30:53.806

roll a joint like this?

30:53.807 --> 31:00.479
♪ Lord knows, I can't change ♪

31:00.480 --> 31:03.399
If I wanted to do this thing,

31:03.400 --> 31:06.110
how might I go about that, precisely?

31:16.245 --> 31:18.247
How did it go?

31:18.248 --> 31:20.917
There were a few tears here and there

31:20.918 --> 31:23.210
and some anger,

31:23.211 --> 31:25.880
but nothing unexpected.

31:28.841 --> 31:32.637
I'm going to need you to
leave us today, too, Evelyn.

31:32.638 --> 31:34.555
I'm sorry.

31:34.556 --> 31:37.266
I just can't have any doubt
about the direction I'm taking.

31:43.147 --> 31:45.858
You just had me fire 18 people.

31:45.859 --> 31:47.777
I know.

31:47.778 --> 31:49.862
I sat across from them in this room,

31:49.863 --> 31:52.406
and I had to tell
each and every one of--

31:52.407 --> 31:54.074
I know.

31:55.451 --> 31:57.411
I am 59 years old.

31:57.412 --> 31:59.455
Nobody hires anybody my age.

31:59.456 --> 32:01.666
I will write you
any kind of recommenda--

32:01.667 --> 32:04.042
To do what, bag groceries?

32:04.043 --> 32:06.211
What am I supposed to tell my daughter?

32:06.212 --> 32:08.506
I'm sorry, Evelyn.
I truly am.

32:08.507 --> 32:10.549
No, you're not.
You don't give a fuck.

32:12.217 --> 32:15.220
Eighteen people, Claire.

32:18.683 --> 32:21.644
Nineteen, if you count me.

32:23.145 --> 32:25.773
I have to...

32:26.983 --> 32:29.443
I have to call my daughter.

33:10.693 --> 33:14.112
I know today has been tough.

33:14.113 --> 33:16.574
A lot of your colleagues have left,

33:16.575 --> 33:19.326
and I owe you an explanation.

33:20.995 --> 33:23.121
Many of those who left us today

33:23.122 --> 33:25.290
helped build the C.W.I.
from the ground up,

33:25.291 --> 33:27.501
and I'm grateful to them.

33:27.502 --> 33:30.629
But it is time for us to evolve,

33:30.630 --> 33:32.130
and to accomplish this,

33:32.131 --> 33:35.509
we had to make hard choices

33:35.510 --> 33:37.929
and bring in new people.

33:37.930 --> 33:40.514
That's what today was about.

33:41.974 --> 33:43.976
You have any questions,

33:43.977 --> 33:46.729
my door is always open.

33:48.230 --> 33:50.858
I'm all good for national and metro.

33:50.859 --> 33:53.569
We've got space for political
if we need it.

33:53.570 --> 33:56.113
Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?

33:56.114 --> 33:57.656
The White House is dodging.

33:57.657 --> 34:00.409
You can't get anyone on record?

34:00.410 --> 34:01.953
Not just me.

34:01.954 --> 34:03.996
They're shutting all of us down
in the briefings.

34:03.997 --> 34:06.832
No one is giving an inch,
even on background.

34:06.833 --> 34:08.626
In the meantime,
I'm working on a feature

34:08.627 --> 34:10.543
about the administration's
foreign policy agenda.

34:10.545 --> 34:12.588
How it shifted
from the start of the campaign,

34:12.589 --> 34:14.547
- increased D.O.D. spending, and--
- Received, Zoe.

34:14.549 --> 34:18.135
I can link Kern directly
to the Williams editorial.

34:18.136 --> 34:20.471
- What?
- I've got a guy named Roy Kapeniak

34:20.472 --> 34:22.764
who was on the editorial staff
when Kern was there.

34:22.766 --> 34:24.558
Hey, Twitter twat,
W.T.F.?

34:24.559 --> 34:26.768
- Wait, wait, wait. Roy what?
- Kapeniak.

34:26.770 --> 34:28.353
A classmate of Kern's.

34:28.353 --> 34:30.815
I have him on record saying
Kern wrote every word

34:30.815 --> 34:33.233
- of the editorial.
- Let's move this into my office.

34:33.234 --> 34:34.610
Zoe, Lucas.

34:40.824 --> 34:42.701
Janine.

34:45.329 --> 34:47.956
Let me-- let me,
once and for all,

34:47.958 --> 34:49.333
say this definitively:

34:49.333 --> 34:51.668
I didn't author that editorial.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.922
Not a single sentence,
word, comma, or period.

34:54.922 --> 34:57.842
If memory serves me, it was
Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

34:57.843 --> 35:01.303
Why on earth he's trying to
claim that I did is beyond me.

35:01.304 --> 35:04.932
Let me further say that I'm a strong
supporter of the state of Israel.

35:04.933 --> 35:07.101
As the most stable country in the region

35:07.102 --> 35:11.022
- and our strongest ally...
- It's Frank Underwood for Cathy.

35:11.023 --> 35:12.606
...in any peace process,

35:12.607 --> 35:15.109
because without the stability of Israel,

35:15.110 --> 35:16.944
there can be no Palestine.

35:16.945 --> 35:19.697
CNN right now.

35:22.366 --> 35:24.618
"Without Israel
there can be no Palestine"?

35:24.619 --> 35:27.245
- I've got it on.
- I would remind Senator Kern

35:27.246 --> 35:30.457
that there was a Palestine long
before there was an Israel.

35:30.458 --> 35:33.711
His comments are not only
ignorant, they are racist.

35:33.712 --> 35:37.089
Get ready, Cathy. Things are
about to move very quickly.

35:37.090 --> 35:39.133
- ...his understanding of the Middle East--
- Okay.

35:39.134 --> 35:41.259
- ...is so out of sync with reality...
- I'm ready.

35:41.260 --> 35:43.512
Hey.

35:43.513 --> 35:45.639
- Peter? No. Stop.
- Uh, not now.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.100
Hey. Hey,
where have you been?

35:49.185 --> 35:51.896
Oh, God, you're fucking high.

35:51.897 --> 35:53.939
- No. I--
- Yes, you are. Look at your eyes.

35:53.940 --> 35:56.441
Oh, please, just lay off.

35:56.442 --> 36:00.404
You promised me
it wouldn't be like this.

36:00.405 --> 36:03.824
Cancel whatever I have
for the rest of the day.

36:40.736 --> 36:42.696
Kern is out.

36:42.697 --> 36:44.656
They're tossing him?

36:44.657 --> 36:47.576
Technically, that would
draw himself, but yes.

36:47.577 --> 36:49.745
Can I say "A source
close to the White House"?

36:49.746 --> 36:52.289
No. You let this story
play out on its own time.

36:52.290 --> 36:53.999
They'll announce in the morning.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.044
I'm sorry. If not that,
what story are we talking about?

36:57.045 --> 36:58.963
Catherine Durant.

36:58.964 --> 37:02.633
As soon as Kern withdraws, you
say she'll be the replacement.

37:02.634 --> 37:05.677
- Is that true?
- It will be after you write it.

37:06.971 --> 37:08.931
Roy Kapeniak was you.

37:08.932 --> 37:12.643
You might very well think that.
I couldn't possibly comment.

37:12.644 --> 37:14.561
You found him.
You had him call me.

37:14.562 --> 37:17.231
Kapeniak and Kern were
appetizers, Miss Barnes.

37:17.232 --> 37:20.025
Catherine Durant is the meal.

37:21.235 --> 37:24.989
Say that name:
Catherine Durant.

37:24.990 --> 37:27.074
Say it over and over.

37:27.075 --> 37:29.701
Tomorrow afternoon, write it down,

37:29.702 --> 37:32.496
and then watch that name
come out of the mouth

37:32.497 --> 37:35.916
of the President of the United States.

37:35.917 --> 37:38.877
This is where we get to create.

37:45.383 --> 37:47.469
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.

37:47.470 --> 37:49.847
It's the last one tonight.

37:51.723 --> 37:54.434
Zoe Barnes with the Washington
Herald now reporting,

37:54.435 --> 37:55.936
quoting a source close to the president,

37:55.937 --> 37:57.813
as saying that Senator Catherine Durant

37:57.814 --> 38:00.440
will likely be the new nominee
for Secretary of State

38:00.441 --> 38:03.319
after Michael Kern's withdrawal
earlier this week.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.612
The White House has remained
silent on whether the president

38:05.613 --> 38:07.239
will tap Durant for a nomination,

38:07.240 --> 38:08.907
but a national Zogby Poll

38:08.908 --> 38:11.493
shows wide support for Durant
across party lines.

38:11.494 --> 38:14.205
Catherine Durant has served ten years on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

38:14.206 --> 38:16.957
made numerous diplomatic
missions to South America...

38:16.958 --> 38:19.877
We can place our faith in her,
knowing that we have a responsible,

38:19.878 --> 38:22.921
experienced, brilliant woman
representing our interests abroad.

38:22.922 --> 38:26.383
Middle of the road, team
player, strong in defense.

38:26.384 --> 38:28.969
If there's a woman that can work with
the joint chiefs, she's the one.

38:28.970 --> 38:31.222
Durant is the way to go.
It's a no-brainer.

38:31.223 --> 38:33.807
The president should stop this
pageant and simply make the call.

38:33.808 --> 38:36.560
Why are we still talking about, if
they're going to nominate Durant?

38:36.561 --> 38:38.187
Why don't they just do it already

38:38.188 --> 38:40.356
so we can all stop talking about ifs

38:40.357 --> 38:42.233
and start talking about when and what

38:42.234 --> 38:46.111
and how Durant's going to
shape up foreign policy...

39:12.263 --> 39:14.514
So, history?

39:16.308 --> 39:17.935
History.

39:21.189 --> 39:24.733
I'm very impressed, Frank.

39:24.734 --> 39:26.484
Good. With your go-ahead,
I'll start the mock-up.

39:26.485 --> 39:28.279
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?

39:28.280 --> 39:30.364
Not yet. I wanted you to be
the first to have a look.

39:30.365 --> 39:32.408
I'll schedule a time for you
to fill in the president.

39:32.409 --> 39:35.493
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda.
You should do that.

39:35.494 --> 39:38.747
- Thank you, Frank.
- My pleasure. Thank you.

39:38.748 --> 39:42.126
- I so apologize for everything--
- No, no, no, n--

39:42.127 --> 39:44.628
it's not necessary.

39:44.629 --> 39:46.713
Now for the real meeting.

39:46.714 --> 39:50.092
So what is happening with Michael Kern?

39:50.093 --> 39:52.177
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

39:52.178 --> 39:54.512
You know who you're gonna tap next?

39:54.513 --> 39:56.848
Frank, we still need you
in the house--

39:56.849 --> 39:58.934
No, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

39:58.935 --> 40:01.437
We've got our education bill.
I was just curious.

40:01.438 --> 40:03.355
Somehow the rumor is flying around

40:03.356 --> 40:05.190
that we're gonna nominate
Catherine Durant.

40:05.191 --> 40:07.943
- I'm sure you've noticed.
- Is the rumor true?

40:07.944 --> 40:09.653
Well, we weren't
considering her at first,

40:09.654 --> 40:11.363
but the president asked me
to have her vetted

40:11.364 --> 40:13.782
in case we wanna go that route.

40:13.783 --> 40:16.576
- Interesting.
- What do you think?

40:19.913 --> 40:21.790
Well, she wouldn't be
my first choice--

40:21.791 --> 40:23.417
Who would be your first choice?

40:23.418 --> 40:25.710
She campaigned hard against us
in the primaries.

40:25.711 --> 40:29.381
- That's my reservation.
- But you'd show yourself above party politics,

40:29.382 --> 40:31.591
and I know she'd work
all the harder for it.

40:31.592 --> 40:34.219
Decent experience,
respect across the aisle.

40:34.220 --> 40:36.347
So you think we can
seriously consider her?

40:38.140 --> 40:40.934
It's not the worst idea in the world.

41:00.537 --> 41:03.581
- Where are you getting this shit?
- What?

41:03.582 --> 41:07.044
- Your stories. Who are you fucking?
- I was just--

41:07.961 --> 41:09.963
- Nobody.
- Oh, come on.

41:09.964 --> 41:13.217
You're a metro scrub,
and now look at you.

41:13.218 --> 41:15.135
You'd have to be fucking
somebody important.

41:15.136 --> 41:18.096
I'm just doing my job, Janine.

41:18.097 --> 41:20.015
Excuse me.

41:25.562 --> 41:28.023
All set.

41:29.733 --> 41:32.528
- Is this your first remote?
- Yeah, it's my first time.

41:42.662 --> 41:45.416
Right into the camera,
don't shift in your seat,

41:45.417 --> 41:48.043
and there's no reason to speak
above a conversational volume.

41:48.044 --> 41:50.295
- The mic will pick you up. You all ready?
- Yeah.

41:50.296 --> 41:52.548
All right.
Don't forget to breathe.

41:56.134 --> 41:58.678
Five, four...

42:01.224 --> 42:06.770
We'd like to welcome Zoe
Barnes from the Washington Herald.

42:06.771 --> 42:08.897
Zoe, thank you for joining us.

42:08.898 --> 42:11.608
I'm very glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

42:11.609 --> 42:15.112
You broke the education bill, the
Kern editorial, and now Durant.

42:15.113 --> 42:17.739
I'm just thrilled to be
reporting news that matters.

42:17.740 --> 42:19.657
And it's truly been a team effort.

42:19.658 --> 42:21.659
Everyone at the Herald pitched in.

42:21.660 --> 42:25.747
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

42:25.748 --> 42:28.041
First national story, first...

42:37.050 --> 42:38.969
Thank you.

42:40.637 --> 42:42.722
Calling it a night.

42:43.848 --> 42:46.477
See you tomorrow, sir.

42:52.190 --> 42:54.943
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

42:54.944 --> 42:57.571
First national story,

42:57.572 --> 42:59.739
first front-page byline,

42:59.740 --> 43:02.367
first TV interview.

43:02.368 --> 43:07.205
I would wave to my mom, but the
cameraman said not to shift in my seat.

43:10.208 --> 43:13.211
What a roller coaster.

43:13.212 --> 43:17.132
It really is too bad.
Kern was a good man.

43:17.133 --> 43:19.426
- And now Catherine Durant.
- Yes.

43:19.427 --> 43:21.803
Right place, right time, I suppose.

43:21.804 --> 43:24.722
- We like her, don't we?
- Very much.

43:24.723 --> 43:27.892
Question is, does she like San
Corp as much as we like her?

43:27.893 --> 43:30.479
I would say that
that is a very good bet.

43:30.480 --> 43:32.439
But then again, I'm not a betting man.

43:32.440 --> 43:35.108
- No. You always like a sure thing.
- When it avails itself.

43:35.109 --> 43:37.152
- Good night, Remy.
- Good night, Frank.

43:37.153 --> 43:40.614
- See you around.
- Hopefully less and less now.

43:46.161 --> 43:48.163
Oh, no.
I charged the wrong thing.

43:48.164 --> 43:50.999
- What did you have again?
- A medium decaf latte.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.545
Med lat, dec.

43:59.091 --> 44:01.301
I don't know how to get it to go back.

44:01.302 --> 44:03.928
- This one and this one.
- This one?

44:03.929 --> 44:06.097
No. Let me do it.

44:19.237 --> 44:21.363
I have to ask you
to stay back, congressman.

44:21.364 --> 44:23.990
- What's going on?
- Some guy was trying to get into the building.

44:23.991 --> 44:27.202
When we said no, he started
tearing his clothes off.

44:49.558 --> 44:53.019
Nobody can hear you.
Nobody cares about you.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.105
Nothing will come of this.

44:58.442 --> 45:01.986
Why don't you let these nice
gentlemen take you home?

45:09.494 --> 45:12.163
Cover him up.
It's cold out here.

45:12.164 --> 45:14.374
You heard the congressman.

45:14.375 --> 45:16.460
Cover him up.

45:37.855 --> 45:40.484
Francis?
