WEBVTT

00:14.648 --> 00:17.115
Uh, hey, Mike, there's something
blocking the door.

00:17.117 --> 00:20.651
Yeah, some idiot
left those in my garage.

00:20.653 --> 00:22.218
These are all my boxes.

00:24.622 --> 00:26.121
Oh.

00:26.123 --> 00:29.224
Look, if I don't recycle
a milk jug, you have a stroke,

00:29.226 --> 00:31.292
but you don't mind using
my garage

00:31.294 --> 00:32.793
as your personal landfill.

00:32.795 --> 00:34.528
Yeah, well, Kristin and I
don't have the extra space.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.563
Sure you do -- out behind
your apartment building.

00:36.565 --> 00:39.232
It's called a dumpster.

00:39.234 --> 00:40.800
Hey, look.
My ukulele.

00:40.802 --> 00:42.001
Yeah. Great.

00:42.003 --> 00:43.902
Why don't you give me
a little Jimi Hendrix?

00:43.904 --> 00:45.003
Never learned to play.

00:45.005 --> 00:46.971
No, I mean
light it on fire.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.576
You can't make fun
of my leather crafting,

00:52.578 --> 00:54.177
because this is
some quality work.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.345
You won't eat meat,
but if someone kills a cow,

00:56.347 --> 00:57.546
you'll play with its skin.

00:57.548 --> 00:59.247
That's just weird.

00:59.249 --> 01:01.048
Hey. Hi, honey.
Come on in.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.250
You're just in time
for a stroll down

01:03.252 --> 01:05.252
Ryan's boulevard
of broken dreams.

01:05.254 --> 01:06.753
Hi, dad.

01:06.755 --> 01:07.887
Hey, bud.
How was school?

01:07.889 --> 01:09.889
Bye, dad.

01:09.891 --> 01:11.757
Okay, what did he do now?

01:11.759 --> 01:14.092
Apparently,
he got suspended for the day

01:14.094 --> 01:17.261
for announcing that his teacher
was [Singsong voice] boring.

01:17.263 --> 01:19.229
Great.
That's awesome.

01:19.231 --> 01:20.897
That's a little harsh.

01:20.899 --> 01:22.565
I mean, the worst thing
I ever got for telling a joke

01:22.567 --> 01:23.732
was detention.

01:23.734 --> 01:26.367
And I -- I worked
pretty blue back then.

01:26.369 --> 01:27.701
That was his third strike.

01:27.703 --> 01:29.903
He keeps getting in trouble
for disrupting the class,

01:29.905 --> 01:31.905
and I have no idea
what's going on with him.

01:31.907 --> 01:34.173
Well, I'll tell you
what it is -- he's bored.

01:34.175 --> 01:35.340
Yeah, no kidding.

01:35.342 --> 01:36.708
He didn't get suspended

01:36.710 --> 01:39.744
for saying
[Singsong voice] "interesting."

01:39.746 --> 01:41.746
Did you talk to his teacher
like I told you to?

01:41.748 --> 01:43.280
His teacher is the problem,
okay?

01:43.282 --> 01:45.348
If she was doing her job,
he wouldn't be bored.

01:45.350 --> 01:46.882
Oh, everybody blames
the teacher.

01:46.884 --> 01:49.284
You know, but it's hard for us
to keep the kids interested

01:49.286 --> 01:50.852
when we have to teach
to the test

01:50.854 --> 01:53.921
and Lisa Morales shows up
in a halter top.

01:53.923 --> 01:55.722
Put Boyd in another class

01:55.724 --> 01:58.758
and maybe get Lisa Morales
a nice sweater.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.926
Oh, stop that.

02:00.928 --> 02:02.761
I can't just put him
in another class, okay?

02:02.763 --> 02:04.462
There's all sorts of rules
against that.

02:04.464 --> 02:05.629
But something's
got to change

02:05.631 --> 02:06.963
'cause he's not
learning anything anymore.

02:06.965 --> 02:09.465
Wow.
The public education system.

02:09.467 --> 02:11.433
Imagine that --
a large government program

02:11.435 --> 02:12.901
that doesn't work
very well.

02:12.903 --> 02:14.602
Hey!

02:14.604 --> 02:17.404
Despite the heroic efforts
of our teachers.

02:17.406 --> 02:19.606
Well, luckily, I'm off tomorrow,
so I can stay home with him.

02:19.608 --> 02:21.741
You know, why don't you make it
a day of learning?

02:21.743 --> 02:23.609
Maybe take him to the museum
or the aquarium?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.043
Wait a second.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.612
We could do something my dad
and I used to love to do --

02:27.614 --> 02:29.747
move boxes!

02:29.749 --> 02:32.816
-- Captions by vitac --

02:36.588 --> 02:38.588
morning, Mike.
Here are the reports.

02:38.590 --> 02:39.755
I'll get them to kris.

02:39.757 --> 02:42.390
Listen, you put your kids
in private school, right?

02:42.392 --> 02:43.724
Oh, yeah.

02:43.726 --> 02:45.459
Cost me
a lot of money, too.

02:45.461 --> 02:49.462
Every parents' night I went to,
I picked up a new wife.

02:50.431 --> 02:51.630
What was
your pick-up line?

02:51.632 --> 02:53.231
"My kid's struggling
to stay in school,

02:53.233 --> 02:55.933
much like your bosom
in that sweater."

02:55.935 --> 03:00.437
No, mine was more like,
"hi, I'm a millionaire."

03:00.439 --> 03:01.971
Why are you asking
about private schools?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.172
It's for Boyd.

03:03.174 --> 03:06.074
The only thing public education
is teaching him

03:06.076 --> 03:07.675
is how to hate learning.

03:07.677 --> 03:09.410
Oh, Kristin told me
about Boyd's suspension.

03:09.412 --> 03:11.345
I didn't know that they were
planning to switch schools.

03:11.347 --> 03:12.679
She doesn't know
about this yet.

03:12.681 --> 03:14.080
But she'll be all right
with this.

03:14.082 --> 03:15.614
The research is for Ryan.

03:15.616 --> 03:18.350
I like to get
overwhelming evidence

03:18.352 --> 03:20.251
for why people are wrong.

03:20.253 --> 03:21.151
Ah, I see.

03:21.153 --> 03:22.919
Well, you're a wonderful
grandfather,

03:22.921 --> 03:25.154
and you're not overstepping
in the least.

03:29.193 --> 03:32.460
Kyle, I need this raccoon
problem solved, like, yesterday.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.195
Well, if you needed it
solved yesterday,

03:34.197 --> 03:36.530
you should have come to me
yesterday.

03:36.532 --> 03:38.598
Actually,
yesterday was my day off.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.200
Although, I was here
in an unofficial capacity.

03:41.202 --> 03:43.802
You know, just shopping
and loading some boxes,

03:43.804 --> 03:44.836
a few deliveries.

03:44.838 --> 03:46.604
Super relaxing.

03:46.606 --> 03:48.172
What's this
about a raccoon?

03:48.174 --> 03:49.840
There's one
hiding in the store

03:49.842 --> 03:51.708
and raiding the restaurant
at night,

03:51.710 --> 03:53.710
which is
a huge health-code violation.

03:53.712 --> 03:55.944
Unless you can get him
to wear a hair net.

03:58.448 --> 04:00.848
Raccoon in a hair net!

04:02.384 --> 04:04.550
I am going to call
an exterminator.

04:04.552 --> 04:05.617
Oh, no, no, no, no.

04:05.619 --> 04:06.517
No exterminator.

04:06.519 --> 04:08.352
No, no.
This is a hunting store.

04:08.354 --> 04:10.020
I mean,
how would that look?

04:10.022 --> 04:11.855
What exactly
are you suggesting?

04:11.857 --> 04:14.190
I'm not suggesting
anything.

04:14.192 --> 04:16.825
Just keep it
to a small caliber.

04:16.827 --> 04:19.694
I just don't want
all that raccoon blood

04:19.696 --> 04:21.028
on the merchandise.

04:21.030 --> 04:22.262
Okay?

04:24.332 --> 04:26.031
Hey, love.
Hey, honey.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.665
You're on your own
for dinner tonight.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.233
I pulled some stew
out of the freezer.

04:29.235 --> 04:32.268
Great, 'cause it can watch me
order pizza.

04:33.371 --> 04:34.837
I thought
we were gonna stay home,

04:34.839 --> 04:36.205
talk to Ryan
about Boyd's school?

04:36.207 --> 04:37.906
Well, you're on your own
for that, too.

04:37.908 --> 04:40.241
I have to go back to the school
for a mandatory meeting.

04:40.243 --> 04:42.042
What kind of meeting
do you have right now?

04:42.044 --> 04:43.243
I don't know.

04:43.245 --> 04:46.012
Probably about the importance
of mandatory meetings.

04:46.014 --> 04:49.348
As long as it takes time and
energy away from the students,

04:49.350 --> 04:50.849
that's what's important.

04:50.851 --> 04:53.585
You have to delete every one
of those pictures, Eve.

04:53.587 --> 04:57.822
Sorry, they're already
in the cloud with grandma.

04:57.824 --> 04:59.190
I am not breaking up
this fight.

04:59.192 --> 05:00.224
I don't get paid
to do it here.

05:00.226 --> 05:01.325
Love you. Bye.

05:01.327 --> 05:03.327
I don't get paid
for this either.

05:03.329 --> 05:04.528
They came out of you!

05:04.530 --> 05:06.730
Eve took a bunch
of hideous pictures of me.

05:06.732 --> 05:07.731
It's for a class.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.933
We have to take an elective
in the arts.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.901
I chose photography --
you just have to press a button

05:11.903 --> 05:13.269
and let the camera
do all the work.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.903
There's more to photography
than that.

05:14.905 --> 05:16.004
I've taken pictures.

05:16.006 --> 05:17.005
There really isn't.

05:17.007 --> 05:18.406
I'm with Mandy on this.

05:18.408 --> 05:20.941
I take a lot of pictures
for our catalog.

05:20.943 --> 05:22.609
Every picture tells a story.

05:22.611 --> 05:23.710
Like what, dad?

05:23.712 --> 05:25.678
There once was a man
who wanted to buy a tent?

05:26.681 --> 05:28.947
Or hiking boots
or a gun or camping gear.

05:28.949 --> 05:30.415
There's a thousand stories.

05:30.417 --> 05:33.684
Well, the assignment was to take
pictures of somebody at work.

05:33.686 --> 05:35.085
I took pictures of Mandy.

05:35.087 --> 05:37.454
Yeah, but she took pictures
of basement Mandy.

05:37.456 --> 05:40.056
No one's supposed to see
basement Mandy!

05:40.058 --> 05:42.291
That's why
she's in the basement.

05:42.293 --> 05:45.227
Well, you know who doesn't care
about this right now

05:45.229 --> 05:46.795
is kitchen Mike.

05:48.799 --> 05:50.565
No one's going to see
these photos

05:50.567 --> 05:52.800
but my stupid
photography teacher, Mr. Osgood.

05:52.802 --> 05:54.868
Aw, Mr. Osgood
with the man bun

05:54.870 --> 05:57.036
who used to play guitar
at lunch?

05:57.038 --> 05:59.071
Aw, I had a huge crush
on him!

05:59.073 --> 06:00.806
Have you seen him lately?

06:00.808 --> 06:03.608
The only thing worse
than a man bun --

06:03.610 --> 06:05.109
a receding man bun.

06:09.548 --> 06:11.114
Grandpa?

06:11.116 --> 06:12.982
Hey, there.

06:12.984 --> 06:14.950
I went to the science center.
[ Chuckles ]

06:14.952 --> 06:18.119
I saw a bug
and another bug and another bug

06:18.121 --> 06:20.154
and another bug
and another bug --

06:20.156 --> 06:22.222
great! You know who'd love
to hear this story?

06:22.224 --> 06:23.756
Mandy.
She's out in the kitchen.

06:23.758 --> 06:27.092
Aunt Mandy!
I went to the science center!

06:27.094 --> 06:29.094
I saw a bug
and another bug...

06:29.096 --> 06:30.495
You should have
seen him, Mike.

06:30.497 --> 06:32.663
I mean, he was running around
from exhibit to exhibit,

06:32.665 --> 06:34.164
asking me
all sorts of questions.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.465
He couldn't
get enough of it.

06:35.467 --> 06:36.999
I'm sure
he was running around --

06:37.001 --> 06:39.001
the place was crawling
with bugs.

06:39.003 --> 06:40.802
Whatever problems
he's having in school,

06:40.804 --> 06:42.670
it's not because
he doesn't want to learn.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.672
It's just he needs
more individual attention.

06:44.674 --> 06:47.508
Exactly, which is why we'll
send him to private school.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.142
Good talk.

06:49.144 --> 06:50.143
Sorry, what?

06:50.145 --> 06:51.844
Are we still on this?

06:51.846 --> 06:53.111
Private schools are elitist,

06:53.113 --> 06:54.946
and they go against
all of my principles.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.114
Well, for once, this isn't about
your principles.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.782
It's about what's best
for the kid.

06:58.784 --> 07:01.084
We really aren't
a private-school family.

07:01.086 --> 07:03.319
Well, Vanessa and I would be
happy to help you pay for it.

07:03.321 --> 07:05.020
Well, not happy,
but we would pay for it.

07:05.022 --> 07:06.654
Mike, I...

07:06.656 --> 07:07.688
Listen, listen.

07:07.690 --> 07:09.656
Look, private schools
have more freedom.

07:09.658 --> 07:11.190
They have smaller class sizes,

07:11.192 --> 07:12.858
and, as you
so brilliantly pointed out,

07:12.860 --> 07:15.360
Boyd needs
the individual attention.

07:15.362 --> 07:18.363
Okay. Fine.

07:18.365 --> 07:20.498
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to
<i>look</i> into some private schools.

07:20.500 --> 07:21.665
Don't have to bother.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.833
I already did
all your research for you.

07:23.835 --> 07:25.000
Ha, ha!

07:25.002 --> 07:26.401
All right, great talk.

07:31.941 --> 07:34.508
All right, the raccoon traps
are all set for tonight.

07:34.510 --> 07:37.076
We just have to wait
for the bait to finish cooking.

07:38.512 --> 07:39.511
Cooking?

07:39.513 --> 07:41.646
Did the raccoon order
a last meal?

07:41.648 --> 07:45.016
I know you're joking,
but if you humanize him,

07:45.018 --> 07:47.985
it's gonna make it harder
to kill him.

07:47.987 --> 07:49.653
And because it's so important
to catch him,

07:49.655 --> 07:51.388
I'm making my grandmother's
beef Wellington.

07:51.390 --> 07:53.857
Oh. That sounds like
a lot of work.

07:53.859 --> 07:54.958
No, not really.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.993
I didn't make the puff pastry
from scratch.

07:56.995 --> 07:58.995
I figured
Mr. "I usually eat garbage"

07:58.997 --> 08:00.729
wouldn't know
the difference.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.265
Darn it,
I humanized him.

08:05.635 --> 08:08.135
Hey, kris.
This is from Ed's office.

08:08.137 --> 08:09.503
Okay.
Thanks.

08:09.505 --> 08:10.704
Something smells good.

08:10.706 --> 08:12.138
What's the special today?

08:12.140 --> 08:14.306
Raccoon bait.

08:14.308 --> 08:16.641
You might want to think of a
better name for the chalkboard.

08:16.643 --> 08:19.477
Hey, listen,
uh, Ryan's coming in.

08:19.479 --> 08:20.811
We had
a long talk last night,

08:20.813 --> 08:22.412
and I think that he might
be coming around

08:22.414 --> 08:23.880
to your whole
private-school idea.

08:23.882 --> 08:26.816
Well, you know what?
Your dad can be very convincing.

08:26.818 --> 08:28.050
Not all the time,

08:28.052 --> 08:30.585
'cause this place is not called
"Outdoor Mike's."

08:30.587 --> 08:32.386
-Hey, there he is.
-Hi.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.388
Hi.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.555
Hey, Mike.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.323
I wanted to thank you
for your talk yesterday.

08:37.325 --> 08:39.058
You made
some really good points.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.360
I had a little help
from something called reality.

08:41.362 --> 08:43.161
I was dropping Boyd off today
at school,

08:43.163 --> 08:45.263
and he asked me
"why do I have to go back here?"

08:45.265 --> 08:46.864
And I didn't know
what to tell him.

08:46.866 --> 08:49.933
Kind of choking on the words
"grandpa was right"?

08:49.935 --> 08:51.834
He had so much fun
learning yesterday,

08:51.836 --> 08:53.836
and I realized
he's never gonna get that

08:53.838 --> 08:55.404
in those big classes
at Clark.

08:55.406 --> 08:57.572
I told you last night
that I think private school

08:57.574 --> 08:58.606
is a great idea.

08:58.608 --> 08:59.707
I know.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.575
But I have an even better idea.
Oh, boy.

09:01.577 --> 09:03.109
I'm gonna take him
out of Clark

09:03.111 --> 09:06.946
and I'm gonna
homeschool him.

09:06.948 --> 09:11.517
Hey, looks like reality and I
have a little more work to do.

09:19.758 --> 09:22.125
You want to
homeschool Boyd?

09:22.127 --> 09:24.360
Yes. I think it's the perfect
solution for him.

09:24.362 --> 09:25.594
Really?

09:25.596 --> 09:27.262
You two sitting around
in your Buzz Lightyear pajamas,

09:27.264 --> 09:28.696
doing algebra?

09:29.899 --> 09:31.465
Yeah, this actually
doesn't concern you.

09:31.467 --> 09:32.933
I just came to talk to you
about it.

09:32.935 --> 09:34.100
Yeah, yeah.
How do you want to handle this?

09:34.102 --> 09:35.367
You want to gang up on him,

09:35.369 --> 09:37.135
or do it in that
sneaky wife way?

09:37.137 --> 09:40.138
Dad, I have a lot of faith
in Ryan.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.807
Ah, the sneaky wife way.

09:42.809 --> 09:45.409
What I'm saying is, if he thinks
this is something he can do,

09:45.411 --> 09:47.244
then I'm open
to having that discussion.

09:47.246 --> 09:48.278
Let's discuss it.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.245
Bad idea.

09:49.247 --> 09:50.813
End of discussion.

09:50.815 --> 09:52.114
You know what?
Maybe we'll just talk about this

09:52.116 --> 09:53.615
when you get home.
Yeah.

09:53.617 --> 09:54.916
But I am really excited.

09:54.918 --> 09:57.752
I think
it's gonna be great.

09:57.754 --> 09:58.919
I'll tell you what,

09:58.921 --> 10:00.086
public education's
starting to look pretty good

10:00.088 --> 10:02.154
right about now,
isn't it?

10:02.156 --> 10:03.788
Are you okay with this?

10:03.790 --> 10:05.456
I-I'm not sure
what I am yet, okay?

10:05.458 --> 10:07.257
It kind of just came out
of the blue.

10:07.259 --> 10:09.592
When I was a kid,
in our neighborhood,

10:09.594 --> 10:12.127
there was a homeschooled boy,
Tommy Clayman.

10:12.129 --> 10:14.829
He used to carry goldfish around
in a bowl.

10:14.831 --> 10:17.298
What does that have to do
with homeschooling?

10:17.300 --> 10:18.832
He learned that somewhere!

10:20.769 --> 10:23.136
I need some time to figure out
how I feel about this.

10:23.138 --> 10:24.804
Aren't you the one
who always says

10:24.806 --> 10:27.406
to gather all of the information
before making a decision?

10:27.408 --> 10:29.808
There was no water
in the bowl!

10:34.414 --> 10:35.813
I got your text.

10:35.815 --> 10:37.981
What are you -- oh, my god.

10:37.983 --> 10:41.117
Oh, I just figured
that I should support

10:41.119 --> 10:43.119
your educational endeavors,

10:43.121 --> 10:44.954
and so if you have to
take photos of me

10:44.956 --> 10:47.456
slaving away, so be it.

10:47.458 --> 10:50.224
Uh, here's me
pondering a sketch.

10:52.494 --> 10:53.993
This is me leaving.

10:53.995 --> 10:55.194
What? Why?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.929
Eve, you said you needed
pictures of me working.

10:56.931 --> 10:58.297
This is me working.

10:58.299 --> 11:00.499
We can call this one "casually
laughing with a coworker."

11:00.501 --> 11:03.301
[ Laughs ]
Stop it -- you're so bad!

11:03.303 --> 11:05.102
[ Laughs ]

11:05.104 --> 11:07.304
If the assignment
was to photograph

11:07.306 --> 11:10.674
someone's descent into madness,
then I'd be all over this.

11:10.676 --> 11:12.942
Eve, those pictures
you took of me the other day

11:12.944 --> 11:14.043
were terrible.

11:14.045 --> 11:16.211
Well, that's because
you were deep in thought,

11:16.213 --> 11:17.812
which your face
struggles with.

11:17.814 --> 11:19.513
I'm just
really stressed out

11:19.515 --> 11:22.182
about this new line
of beaded dresses I'm making,

11:22.184 --> 11:24.551
and the last thing
I need to worry about

11:24.553 --> 11:26.653
is photos of me
winding up online.

11:26.655 --> 11:29.222
It could be another
Ashley Madison disaster.

11:29.224 --> 11:31.390
That website for cheaters
that got hacked?

11:31.392 --> 11:33.725
No.
My friend Ashley Madison.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.528
Her little brother
posted a photo of her sneezing.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.296
She never recovered
socially.

11:39.298 --> 11:42.165
She had to go to the prom
with someone who was in band.

11:42.167 --> 11:43.399
Band!

11:46.637 --> 11:49.371
Um, I'll be back
when you're really working.

11:49.373 --> 11:50.538
But I<i> am</i> working.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.239
This is me on the phone
with a buyer from Milan.

11:52.241 --> 11:55.175
[ Italian accent ]
Oh, ciao! Rigatoni! Mozzarella!

11:55.177 --> 11:57.443
Eve-a, come-a back-a!

12:03.583 --> 12:06.083
Hey, teach.
How was school?

12:06.085 --> 12:07.884
Wine.

12:09.487 --> 12:12.120
And I guess
we have our answer.

12:14.224 --> 12:16.090
Honey...

12:16.092 --> 12:17.724
You're gonna use a glass,
right?

12:20.829 --> 12:22.395
Fine.
Hand me the big one.

12:23.998 --> 12:27.232
Listen, since you're in
such a good mood,

12:27.234 --> 12:29.100
let me make it even better.

12:29.102 --> 12:31.368
Ryan wants to
homeschool Boyd.

12:31.370 --> 12:33.169
Homeschool?

12:33.171 --> 12:35.004
Oh, my god.

12:35.006 --> 12:37.773
See, that's exactly
what I said, but I...

12:37.775 --> 12:40.475
I didn't use
the lord's name in vain.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.844
Well, I hope you tried
to talk him out of it.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.412
I mean,
you obviously had time

12:45.414 --> 12:47.313
since you weren't making
any dinner.

12:49.283 --> 12:51.783
Do you want
some frozen stew?

12:53.787 --> 12:55.219
Well,
what did you tell him?

12:55.221 --> 12:57.054
Well, at first,
I thought it was a bad idea.

12:57.056 --> 12:59.356
And then I did some research,
and I'm sure you know this,

12:59.358 --> 13:01.424
but homeschooling has become,
like, a valid option.

13:01.426 --> 13:04.927
It's not just for weirdos
that carry around dead goldfish.

13:04.929 --> 13:06.228
You know what's scary?

13:06.230 --> 13:08.597
I know you're talking
about Tommy Clayman.

13:08.599 --> 13:10.031
But Senator Clayman aside,

13:10.033 --> 13:12.366
I'm concerned
about Boyd's socialization.

13:12.368 --> 13:13.900
You know,
but they do get together

13:13.902 --> 13:15.234
with other
homeschooled kids.

13:15.236 --> 13:16.568
They go on field trips.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.570
It's much like your wine club
that pretends to read books.

13:18.572 --> 13:23.274
You need trained teachers to
help prepare kids for college.

13:23.276 --> 13:25.476
I talked to my chancellor buddy
at U.C. Boulder.

13:25.478 --> 13:26.910
They like
homeschooled kids.

13:26.912 --> 13:29.078
They're independent,
they're critical thinkers.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.113
All right, well, as much as
I'm enjoying this homeschooling,

13:31.115 --> 13:32.914
I still think public schools
have a lot to offer.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.148
Yeah, I get it.

13:34.150 --> 13:37.618
But, you know, public school
hasn't worked well for Boyd.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.252
What's the future
for this kid?

13:39.254 --> 13:40.820
He's built
like a chimney sweep,

13:40.822 --> 13:42.655
and they just don't
use them anymore.

13:42.657 --> 13:43.922
Look, I get it.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.292
I mean, obviously, Boyd needs
more individual attention.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.826
You said it yourself.
Your class size is too big.

13:48.828 --> 13:49.993
What do you have,
40 in your class?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.562
41.
And that's down from 44.

13:52.564 --> 13:55.131
Three are on
maternity leave.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.265
Well, at least you know

13:56.267 --> 13:58.333
that you've got them excited
about biology.

14:00.103 --> 14:02.269
Imagine what an amazing teacher
you'd be

14:02.271 --> 14:03.803
if you just had one student.

14:03.805 --> 14:06.305
Yeah, I'd have that kid
in college by 14.

14:06.307 --> 14:08.473
Well, obviously,
Ryan isn't you, but he's smart.

14:08.475 --> 14:11.008
And with the right preparation,
I think he could do this.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.910
Maybe.
Maybe it could work.

14:15.446 --> 14:16.745
Oh, hey.

14:16.747 --> 14:19.280
I, uh, was just gonna grab
the last of the boxes.

14:19.282 --> 14:21.881
No need to talk to me
about anything.

14:23.651 --> 14:25.917
Listen, you might like
this conversation.

14:25.919 --> 14:28.485
We might be okay
with this homeschooling idea.

14:29.654 --> 14:30.953
Really?

14:30.955 --> 14:33.288
Yeah, but with one change.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.256
I'm gonna teach Boyd.

14:35.258 --> 14:36.156
What?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.492
Yeah, w-what?

14:41.028 --> 14:43.995
I'm gonna quit my job
and homeschool Boyd.

14:43.997 --> 14:46.831
Okay, enough of this.

14:54.773 --> 14:56.439
Look, Vanessa,
I appreciate the offer,

14:56.441 --> 14:57.606
but Boyd is my son,

14:57.608 --> 14:59.140
and I should be the one
to homeschool him.

14:59.142 --> 15:00.274
Yeah,
but I am a teacher.

15:00.276 --> 15:01.642
I mean, Mike,
back me up on this.

15:01.644 --> 15:03.210
He does not get a vote.

15:03.212 --> 15:04.878
I don't want to overstep.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.179
Well...

15:06.181 --> 15:09.282
Don't you think our grandson
should have the best teacher

15:09.284 --> 15:10.383
in this family?

15:10.385 --> 15:13.285
Yeah, but I'm not quitting
<i> my</i> job.

15:13.287 --> 15:14.519
Look, Ryan, Ryan --

15:14.521 --> 15:17.054
Boyd's education
is a 10-year commitment,

15:17.056 --> 15:19.723
and with all due respect,
you're a quitter.

15:19.725 --> 15:20.890
Wow.

15:20.892 --> 15:23.826
I'm not sure I heard
any due respect in there.

15:23.828 --> 15:26.995
Ryan, I mean, look at this box
of commitments you gave up on.

15:26.997 --> 15:29.964
The ukulele, leathertooling,
cheese-making.

15:29.966 --> 15:33.233
If you quit homeschooling
the way you quit these things,

15:33.235 --> 15:34.968
you're gonna devastate Boyd.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.002
I would never give up
on Boyd.

15:36.004 --> 15:37.003
All right,
all right, all right.

15:37.005 --> 15:38.170
Everybody,
let's just hold it.

15:38.172 --> 15:39.671
Do you even know why
I quit those things?

15:39.673 --> 15:40.972
You know what?
Actually, never mind.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.139
Finish
what you were gonna say.

15:43.575 --> 15:44.740
I quit ukulele lessons

15:44.742 --> 15:46.875
so I could take Boyd
to hockey practice.

15:46.877 --> 15:48.343
What about
the cheese stuff?

15:48.345 --> 15:49.677
Boyd's allergic.

15:49.679 --> 15:51.145
And the leather?

15:51.147 --> 15:52.713
I have
very delicate hands.

15:52.715 --> 15:55.048
Well,
it was mostly for Boyd.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.850
I know what he did give up --
sleep.

15:57.852 --> 15:59.418
Remember,
he took the graveyard shift

15:59.420 --> 16:01.720
delivering beer so he could be
there to fix him breakfast?

16:01.722 --> 16:05.656
Sometimes I only made him
oatmeal with no fruit.

16:05.658 --> 16:07.324
I still regret that.

16:07.326 --> 16:08.892
Let's face it --
Ryan is easy to criticize,

16:08.894 --> 16:10.026
and it's actually
quite fun.

16:10.028 --> 16:13.596
But I think
we both would agree

16:13.598 --> 16:15.531
that he does
put his kid first.

16:15.533 --> 16:16.732
I think he could do this.

16:16.734 --> 16:17.666
Can you do this?

16:17.668 --> 16:19.234
Yes, I know that I can.

16:19.236 --> 16:21.102
I-I think he can, too.

16:22.071 --> 16:23.437
Oh, great.
Great.

16:23.439 --> 16:26.573
You guys, you have this
all decided, then, don't you?

16:26.575 --> 16:29.609
I didn't know
Vanessa felt that way about me.

16:29.611 --> 16:30.743
This isn't about you.

16:30.745 --> 16:32.377
This is about
something else.

16:32.379 --> 16:34.011
Well, you backed me up
over your wife,

16:34.013 --> 16:35.012
and I appreciate that.

16:35.014 --> 16:37.581
I don't want to bruise
your delicate hands.

16:43.455 --> 16:44.854
All right, change of plans.

16:44.856 --> 16:47.089
The bait tonight is gonna be
Mac and cheese.

16:48.292 --> 16:50.258
Was something wrong
with the beef Wellington?

16:50.260 --> 16:52.093
No.
It was delicious.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.929
But I think we're safe
with this plan,

16:54.931 --> 16:57.031
because I don't like
Mac and cheese.

17:00.703 --> 17:02.102
What am I doing here?

17:02.104 --> 17:04.437
This happens to me
all the time.

17:04.439 --> 17:07.105
We're staying late
to catch a raccoon.

17:08.775 --> 17:10.141
I'm talking about Boyd.

17:10.143 --> 17:12.610
He's having all this trouble
at school,

17:12.612 --> 17:15.813
and Ryan is dropping everything
to do whatever it takes

17:15.815 --> 17:19.650
to help him, and I'm not.

17:19.652 --> 17:22.486
That's because you have
a really important job.

17:22.488 --> 17:24.287
The most important job
in the world to me

17:24.289 --> 17:25.621
is raising my son.

17:25.623 --> 17:27.623
Yeah,
that's what you're doing --

17:27.625 --> 17:28.624
by your example.

17:28.626 --> 17:29.958
How?

17:29.960 --> 17:32.160
Look, you were pregnant at 17,
no husband,

17:32.162 --> 17:33.928
you were a waitress
in a diner.

17:33.930 --> 17:36.797
So I was
a country-western song.

17:36.799 --> 17:38.298
You were living
with your parents --

17:38.300 --> 17:39.299
I mean, no real future.

17:39.301 --> 17:40.967
I get it. I was a mess.

17:40.969 --> 17:42.635
Yeah,<i> was.</i>

17:42.637 --> 17:43.969
Now you're doing great.

17:43.971 --> 17:46.471
You're showing Boyd that
no matter how rough things get,

17:46.473 --> 17:48.639
you can always
get your life back on track.

17:48.641 --> 17:50.641
I guess that's true.

17:50.643 --> 17:51.675
It definitely is.

17:51.677 --> 17:53.009
I mean,
things were really grim for you.

17:53.011 --> 17:54.977
You missed out on college.
You got that bad haircut.

17:54.979 --> 17:56.812
Kyle, stop.

17:58.081 --> 17:59.146
Good pep talk.

17:59.148 --> 18:00.447
Thank you.

18:00.449 --> 18:03.483
You're welcome. All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:03.485 --> 18:05.017
Kyle.

18:05.019 --> 18:06.985
The raccoon.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.319
Right.
That's what we're doing here.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.553
I should write it
on my hand.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.960
[ Sighs ]

18:18.962 --> 18:19.860
Want some help?

18:19.862 --> 18:21.494
Why, am I not doing
good enough?

18:21.496 --> 18:23.662
You know,
maybe Ryan would do a better job

18:23.664 --> 18:24.929
of folding these towels.

18:24.931 --> 18:27.231
Well, I think he'd do it
with less attitude.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.799
You really want to quit
your job?

18:29.801 --> 18:32.368
I don't want to
quit, Mike.

18:32.370 --> 18:35.170
I just don't want to
keep doing it.

18:35.172 --> 18:36.971
It's a good thing
you don't teach English.

18:36.973 --> 18:38.372
You're not very good
with words.

18:38.374 --> 18:40.040
I'm just so frustrated.

18:40.042 --> 18:42.042
I mean, I spend every day
bogged down

18:42.044 --> 18:44.110
by this giant bureaucracy,
and I'm --

18:44.112 --> 18:45.678
I'm not making
a difference.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.847
But you could if you stayed home
and taught Boyd.

18:48.849 --> 18:51.282
Yeah. You -- if you understand
what I'm going through,

18:51.284 --> 18:52.483
then why did you pick Ryan?

18:52.485 --> 18:54.451
I'm just trying
to make you happy.

18:54.453 --> 18:56.352
You're gonna have to
explain that.

18:56.354 --> 18:58.721
It's hard for me to admit,
but there might be someone

18:58.723 --> 19:00.155
who can explain it
better than me.

19:00.157 --> 19:01.156
Oh, honey...

19:01.158 --> 19:02.157
Listen.

19:02.159 --> 19:03.558
Vanessa:<i> Honey, it's me.</i>

19:03.560 --> 19:05.726

19:05.728 --> 19:06.993

19:06.995 --> 19:08.527

19:08.529 --> 19:11.029

19:11.031 --> 19:12.964

19:12.966 --> 19:15.299

19:15.301 --> 19:17.167

19:17.169 --> 19:19.002
<i> I am so happy,</i>
<i> I even made up a song.</i>

19:19.004 --> 19:21.404
♪<i> Oh, teaching</i>
<i> is the best thing ever</i> ♪

19:21.406 --> 19:24.240
It kind of went off the rails
right about then.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.241
You saved that?

19:26.243 --> 19:27.976
I save
a lot of your voice mails.

19:27.978 --> 19:29.210
My favorite is down here.

19:29.212 --> 19:31.979
You butt-dialed me when you were
trying to parallel park.

19:31.981 --> 19:33.680
You were swearing
like a sailor.

19:33.682 --> 19:36.249
I remember that feeling,

19:36.251 --> 19:38.317
and that girl
never missed a class

19:38.319 --> 19:40.852
until the day
her water broke.

19:40.854 --> 19:41.919
She's coming back.

19:41.921 --> 19:43.053
But if you quit,

19:43.055 --> 19:45.155
who's gonna teach her
or the other kids?

19:45.157 --> 19:46.923
Why do you always have to be
so right?

19:46.925 --> 19:50.526
Don't tell anybody,
but I am from the future.

19:50.528 --> 19:54.162
Yeah. You know, I guess
I should apologize to Ryan.

19:54.164 --> 19:56.430
I don't think so.
That's a bad precedent to set.

19:56.432 --> 19:58.899
I am a little worried, though,
about his commitment. I am.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.600
This doesn't have to happen
tomorrow.

20:00.602 --> 20:02.368
If I don't like
how he's teaching Boyd,

20:02.370 --> 20:03.535
I'll fire him and hire you.

20:03.537 --> 20:04.702
That's sweet, honey,

20:04.704 --> 20:07.071
but it's --
it's really not your decision.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.006
You know,
people keep saying that,

20:09.008 --> 20:11.074
but it's so not the truth.

20:17.849 --> 20:19.381
Hey.
What's going on?

20:19.383 --> 20:22.050
I think I made a huge mistake
trying to make beaded dresses.

20:22.052 --> 20:23.384
They take forever to sew,

20:23.386 --> 20:25.586
and I'm not even sure anyone
is going to like them.

20:25.588 --> 20:28.555
You know, I got an "a"
on the photo essay of you.

20:28.557 --> 20:29.856
Mr. Osgood loved it.

20:29.858 --> 20:31.257
Really?

20:31.259 --> 20:33.525
Dave liked it?

20:33.527 --> 20:36.060
He had students
stop calling him "Dave"

20:36.062 --> 20:38.896
after spending six months
in teacher time-out.

20:38.898 --> 20:40.430
Come look at the photos.

20:40.432 --> 20:42.064
No!
I feel bad enough already.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.299
I don't need to see
ugly pictures of myself.

20:44.301 --> 20:45.967
Look at how good you look,
you idiot.

20:45.969 --> 20:47.368
Blearg.
I had no makeup.

20:47.370 --> 20:48.535
My hair was everywhere.

20:48.537 --> 20:49.836
I probably look like you.

20:52.106 --> 20:55.107
Look, you're missing the story
these pictures are telling.

20:55.109 --> 20:57.109
It's about someone
who loves what they're doing

20:57.111 --> 20:59.377
and doesn't care how they look
while they're doing it.

20:59.379 --> 21:03.814
You're a really good
photographer, Eve.

21:03.816 --> 21:05.415
Thanks.
Yeah.

21:05.417 --> 21:08.551
I mean, I guess I just have
that kind of beauty

21:08.553 --> 21:11.220
that just shines through
no matter what.

21:11.222 --> 21:12.421
Yeah.

21:12.423 --> 21:14.890
They really capture
how two-dimensional you are.

21:14.892 --> 21:17.959
Mm.

21:17.961 --> 21:20.628
Thank you.

21:20.630 --> 21:23.430
So, um, what exactly
did Dave say?

21:23.432 --> 21:24.431
Mm.

21:24.433 --> 21:26.232
He said, "it's great to have
a job again.

21:26.234 --> 21:29.168
Everybody call me
Mr. Osgood."
