GARETH: Now, I have just returned

00:01.674 --> 00:03.752
from a brief visit
with the Governor-General,

00:03.753 --> 00:05.805
where he commissioned me
to form a new government.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.471
What do you have to confess, my child?

00:07.471 --> 00:08.760
"My child"?

00:08.913 --> 00:10.472
You're 11 years old!

00:10.707 --> 00:12.147
No, I'm... I'm 28, mate.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.672
Cleaver! (SCREAMS)

00:16.267 --> 00:18.266
The old Parliament,
the one under the tarp.

00:18.267 --> 00:20.066
I was probably the last bloke
in there, actually.

00:20.067 --> 00:21.187
What were you doing in there?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.066
You know, the thing was meant to be
a toxic wasteland.

00:23.067 --> 00:26.106
This conversation, it never happened.

00:26.107 --> 00:27.706
I mean, it is a literal cover-up.

vis-a-vis these plumbers.

to get some shut-eye, I think,

sleepy-headed and snoozy, Nadia.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.906
Nadia?

00:40.907 --> 00:42.146
You just called me Nadia.

00:42.147 --> 00:44.187
- No, I didn't.
- You just called me Nadia.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.307
- Ugh!

00:49.667 --> 00:51.106
This is a disaster!

00:51.107 --> 00:52.466
Yeah, well, I didn't want to hurt you.

00:52.467 --> 00:54.786
Mate, the whole point of the exercise
was to hurt me.

00:54.787 --> 00:56.186
I know who shot Penny Evans.

00:56.187 --> 00:58.026
- What?
- She ordered it herself.

00:58.027 --> 01:00.186
That's the name
of the fella who shot you.

01:00.187 --> 01:02.026
And I know who organised it.

01:02.027 --> 01:04.465
Walk away, or it's prison.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.546
I will be informing
the President of the Senate

01:06.547 --> 01:08.666
that I resign my seat immediately.

If I ever find you within a country mile

01:10.587 --> 01:12.986

I will hurt you.

touching her, even looking at her,

01:15.787 --> 01:18.266
even sharing the same air she breathes,

01:18.267 --> 01:19.666
I will massacre you.

another hour or so?

a priceless piece of art!

02:19.187 --> 02:20.986
Really? HIS painting?

02:20.987 --> 02:22.826
I'm not sure I know
what you're referring to.

02:22.827 --> 02:26.346
Tell me, did you ask him to show you
a certificate of ownership before...

02:26.347 --> 02:28.226
Officer, just ignore him, would you?

02:28.227 --> 02:30.626
This has been a long-running
dispute between us.

02:30.627 --> 02:33.186
Yes. Which, according to the courts
is far from resolved.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.706
Sir, there isn't much we can do.
This seems to be a civil matter.

02:35.707 --> 02:37.746
Yeah, but... This is hardly
bloody civil, is it?

02:37.747 --> 02:39.666
Unless you can show proof of ownership...

02:39.667 --> 02:43.226
Listen, do you want me to halve
the law enforcement budget next year?

02:43.227 --> 02:45.306
- Because I can, I WILL, do that.
- Good Lord!

02:45.307 --> 02:47.826
Is he threatening an officer of the
law in the performance of his duty?

02:47.827 --> 02:48.987
OK, that's enough. Thank you.

fucking throw away the fucking key!

02:51.467 --> 02:54.306
Oh, well, Officer, I think I might
go inside and get some shut-eye.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.746
I was just, uh, wondering
if you could, uh, move him along.

02:56.747 --> 02:58.986
I wouldn't want the neighbours
calling you out later on.

02:58.987 --> 03:00.706
- Sir... OK. Thank you.
- Thank you very much, officer.

03:00.707 --> 03:02.146

10:29.147 --> 10:30.227
Cancel it.

10:30.228 --> 10:31.786
No! Well...

10:31.787 --> 10:33.346
Jane!

10:33.347 --> 10:36.626
If I can't convince the Chinese
to remain neutral...

10:36.627 --> 10:38.107
...God forbid!

10:43.627 --> 10:44.946
Looking prime ministerial today.

10:44.947 --> 10:47.626
I am. I am. I just got off
the, uh, blower to the States.

10:47.627 --> 10:51.586
Well. Tense times ahead,
keeping China and the US happy.

10:51.587 --> 10:53.666
Rumour's afloat that you're
thinking of a Cabinet reshuffle.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.666
I was just wondering
what you intend to do with Cal.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.786
Most people who bang on
about, uh, destiny,

10:57.787 --> 11:00.866
they end up working returns counters
at Bunnings, or in State Parliament.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.347
But not me. I mean, I was...

11:03.347 --> 11:05.106
I actually knew I was destined.

11:05.107 --> 11:09.066
I mean, even as a child, I felt it in
every fibre, every limb of my body.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.067
(CHUCKLES)

11:10.068 --> 11:12.226
So... you ARE thinking of a reshuffle?

11:12.227 --> 11:15.346
Along the way, I fucked... 116 women,

11:15.347 --> 11:18.346
varying... races and ethnicities,

11:18.347 --> 11:19.826
and I even took one as my wife.

11:19.827 --> 11:23.626
And look at me, I still have
a full head of healthy hair.

11:23.627 --> 11:27.547
I guess you could say there was a
sense of inevitability about it all.

11:28.867 --> 11:30.546
Or maybe I'm just talking in subtext.

11:30.547 --> 11:32.066
Yeah, maybe a little.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.466
Uh, look, I'm happy
with the Defence portfolio.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.226
- Ah.
- Especially now there's talk of war.

11:36.227 --> 11:38.666
But, uh, if you are proposing
Cabinet changes,

11:38.667 --> 11:39.946
we should talk about it.

11:39.947 --> 11:42.627
Well, I don't need you to tell me
what I need to be doing, Joe.

11:43.627 --> 11:45.186
I'm not a stopgap PM.

11:45.187 --> 11:48.066
I'm here to break
Menzies' record in office.

11:48.067 --> 11:49.707
So, when I want your opinion...

11:50.747 --> 11:52.266
...I'll give it to you.

11:52.267 --> 11:55.746
Now, it's time for us to move back
into the big house on the hill,

11:55.747 --> 11:56.947
the new Parliament House.

11:56.948 --> 11:59.546
This office is totally
inappropriate for my needs.

11:59.547 --> 12:01.146
How soon can we get back in?

12:01.147 --> 12:03.266
Well, it's about how we do
a vault face, Gareth.

12:03.267 --> 12:04.267
Mm-hm?

12:04.268 --> 12:06.866
It's been quite useful for us,
this security hysteria.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.306
We increased our numbers.

12:08.307 --> 12:10.226
We've been able to rip money
from all sorts of places.

12:10.227 --> 12:12.186
If we suddenly just say
it's all fine and good

12:12.187 --> 12:13.586
without some plausible explanation,

12:13.587 --> 12:15.306
well, the press is gonna smell a rat.

12:15.307 --> 12:17.146
No, you're overthinking this
as usual, Joe.

12:17.147 --> 12:19.866
We've already got a white coat
with a gambling problem

to front the Estimates Committee.

12:22.747 --> 12:25.026
- I take it you've stacked the panel.
- As much as we can.

12:25.027 --> 12:27.306
The trouble is, David Potter's the chair.

12:27.307 --> 12:29.747
So we need to ensure
those two plumbers keep silent.

12:31.627 --> 12:32.906
They won't be a problem.

12:32.907 --> 12:34.827
We can't guarantee that.

12:56.227 --> 12:58.347

No, I was just, uh...

13:07.427 --> 13:09.266
...checking out your filing, there.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.146
You seem to be doing...

13:11.147 --> 13:13.346
- ...quite a lot of filing.
- I'm not filing.

13:13.347 --> 13:17.106
I'm dumping all the stuff that
you said was vital, but never read.

13:17.107 --> 13:19.066
I can bear looking at it anymore.

13:19.067 --> 13:21.466
So, this, um...

13:21.467 --> 13:24.666
...Midwinter Ball thing,

13:24.667 --> 13:26.867
have you got any plans for that?

13:29.027 --> 13:31.066
Don't even think about it.

13:31.067 --> 13:32.307
No?

13:35.827 --> 13:37.467
Look somewhere else!

13:43.627 --> 13:45.146
- Prime Minister!
- Yes?

13:45.147 --> 13:46.906
Uh, Edmund Seaton needs an urgent word.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.386
Who or what the fuck is Edmund?

13:48.387 --> 13:49.826
He sounds like a refugee from King Lear.

13:49.827 --> 13:51.226
What a play! Do you like the theatre?

13:51.227 --> 13:52.546
Do you know, when I was in high school

13:52.547 --> 13:53.826
I was always the lead in the play,

13:53.827 --> 13:56.546
as much for my good looks
as talent, probably.

13:56.547 --> 13:58.146
Mm. Uh, he runs this place.

13:58.147 --> 13:59.666
No. I do.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.306
He runs the actual building.

14:01.307 --> 14:02.666
Oh, Christ alive, that idiot?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.306
Yes, yes. What does
the Earl of Gloucester want?

14:04.307 --> 14:06.746
That's from the play, by the way,
Edmund wanted to be the Earl.

14:06.747 --> 14:07.747
- Hm?
- Right.

14:07.748 --> 14:09.546
- Well, it's about the Midwinter Ball.
- Yes.

14:09.547 --> 14:10.786
Very important. Very important.

14:10.787 --> 14:12.426
I want more of these public occasions,

14:12.427 --> 14:15.507
so I will speak with
the Earl of Gloucester briefly.

14:16.907 --> 14:18.746
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

14:18.747 --> 14:19.787
- EDMUND: Sorry?

14:19.788 --> 14:21.866
You weren't in the school play.
Didn't have the looks.

14:21.867 --> 14:23.826
- It's about the Midwinter Ball.
- What about the ball?

14:23.827 --> 14:25.906
We have to find another venue,
there's a wedding on.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.706
Well, the WEDDING will have
to find another venue.

14:27.707 --> 14:29.106
The Midwinter Ball, to quote my wife,

14:29.107 --> 14:31.466
is THE biggest event
on the political calendar.

14:31.467 --> 14:33.346
- Now, go away.
- I can't change it.

14:33.347 --> 14:35.346
Because it's been booked and
paid for for over a year now.

14:35.347 --> 14:37.626
Julie! Take Edmund from this, my place

14:37.627 --> 14:40.146
and make sure I never see his face again.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.066
Well, what am I gonna tell them?!

14:42.067 --> 14:43.826
Well, THIS is what you're
going to tell them,

14:43.827 --> 14:45.826
and make sure you quote me verbatim,

14:45.827 --> 14:49.346
verily, I say unto them, they can
take their tin-pot fucking wedding

14:49.347 --> 14:51.066
and shove it up
their collective arseholes.

14:51.067 --> 14:52.586
- Elective arseholes.
- COLLECTIVE arseholes!

14:52.587 --> 14:53.707
COLLECTIVE arseholes.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.706
The Midwinter Ball...

14:55.707 --> 14:59.106
...takes precedence
over all other bookings.

15:01.187 --> 15:02.706

15:02.707 --> 15:04.946
- OK. Where will you be?
- At the ball.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.746
- Yeah, but officially.
- Oh, well, I don't know.

15:06.747 --> 15:08.826
Just get the office
to book me a flight straight after.

Foreign Minister,

15:10.467 --> 15:11.667

I've heard that Gareth
is planning a Cabinet reshuffle.

15:14.427 --> 15:16.546
He wouldn't dare move me.

15:16.547 --> 15:18.267
You are his greatest threat, Cal.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.306

tries to give me Health...

15:21.307 --> 15:24.266
Ooh! He could do a lot worse than Health.

15:24.267 --> 15:25.986
What, you... you're not suggesting...

15:25.987 --> 15:27.587
...Veteran Affairs?

15:28.827 --> 15:30.546
No, he... he couldn't.

15:30.547 --> 15:32.706
He wouldn't.

15:32.707 --> 15:35.786
Oh, Jesus, of course he would,
that's what I'd give him.

15:47.907 --> 15:49.626
What about it?

15:49.627 --> 15:52.266
Well, it's coming up. Bit of a big deal.

15:52.267 --> 15:55.947
And I mean, uh, you're here, I'm here.

15:56.947 --> 16:00.266
That's a bit of a happy confluence
of circumstances, isn't it?

16:00.267 --> 16:02.626
I just thought maybe we could...

16:02.627 --> 16:04.506
...go together.

16:04.507 --> 16:05.507
Why?

16:06.627 --> 16:08.626
- Well, I've covered that, haven't I?
- No.

16:08.627 --> 16:11.666
Look, it's not a date or anything,
it's just, you know,

16:11.667 --> 16:14.586
we go there together
and we leave together,

16:14.587 --> 16:15.946
and...

16:15.947 --> 16:18.546
...in the meantime,
we have a little boogie.

16:18.547 --> 16:20.906
- Why would we do that?
- Oh, well, I don't know.

16:20.907 --> 16:22.906
I mean, fuck, it'd be nice, wouldn't it?

from the monosyllables at any point?

No.

16:31.628 --> 16:34.426

deeper here, you know.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.707
I've, uh, been...

16:41.347 --> 16:43.186
Yeah, just feelings.

emptiness, I guess.

Especially in the mornings.

16:48.187 --> 16:51.706

it'd be lovely to feel a little...

From his lips.

To whom are we referring here, ladies?

17:32.267 --> 17:35.186
- You know who it is.
- (LAUGHS) He knows.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.786
I know he knows.

17:36.787 --> 17:41.786
If we are referring to Frank,
and I believe we are,

17:41.787 --> 17:46.226
I certainly, to all intents
and purposes, sacked him.

17:46.227 --> 17:48.786
I sacked him hard.

17:48.787 --> 17:54.826
And he, you know, to all intents
and purposes, felt how sacked he was.

17:54.827 --> 17:59.306
And, uh, now, it was a tough call.
It was a captain's call, if you will.

17:59.307 --> 18:01.466
Uh, but that's
the rough and tumble of politics.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.986
And he was very distraught
at the end of it.

18:02.987 --> 18:04.866
He says that you promoted him.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.106

18:07.107 --> 18:09.746
I have no idea how he could've...
come up with that notion.

18:09.747 --> 18:13.866
So, what was the very distraught
Frank's function

18:13.867 --> 18:16.066
in his newly appointed sacked position?

18:16.067 --> 18:18.266
Uh, well, his official remit

18:18.267 --> 18:23.226
was to do and say absolutely nothing
to anybody about anything

18:23.227 --> 18:24.866
and to... to prop up the bar.

18:24.867 --> 18:26.106
Well, he has.

18:26.107 --> 18:29.586
He had drinkies with Penny Evans
at her farewell,

18:29.587 --> 18:31.786
and then he told her
that you've been renting out

18:31.787 --> 18:34.186
your government-paid premises on BuzzOK.

18:34.187 --> 18:36.546
- Illegal.
- He wouldn't. He cou... couldn't.

18:36.547 --> 18:37.986
He's not that stupid.

18:37.987 --> 18:40.666
He would. He... he is. And he did.

18:40.667 --> 18:43.586
And then Penny called Caitlin Farquhar.

18:43.587 --> 18:44.707
How do you know that?

18:44.708 --> 18:47.426
Because Caitlin Farquhar called here
demanding an interview,

18:47.427 --> 18:50.187
and she verified Frank
as the original source.

18:51.587 --> 18:52.787
Fuck!

18:52.788 --> 18:54.266
- A word, Frank.
- It's the only way.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.626
- The only way.
- Yeah.

18:55.627 --> 18:59.266
- Uh, you know Ned?
- No, I don't. A word in private.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.786
We've got a problem, Cleave.

19:01.787 --> 19:04.186
I tell you now, it'll be back to Nicole.

19:04.187 --> 19:05.906
I'll, uh, sack her for you if you want.

19:05.907 --> 19:07.906
No, mate. It's you. It's you.

19:07.907 --> 19:09.986
- You spoke to Penny Evans.
- No, I didn't.

19:09.987 --> 19:11.266
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.706
- Yeah, you did.
- Well, as part of my role.

19:13.707 --> 19:15.226
There was a farewell do for her

19:15.227 --> 19:17.946
and, uh, I thought it important
for me to attend.

19:17.947 --> 19:20.186
And I have to say,
I picked up some useful intel.

19:20.187 --> 19:22.906
No, mate, you didn't pick up any...
Do you know what you picked up?

19:22.907 --> 19:26.586
You picked up a glass or six
and you probably fucked my career.

19:26.587 --> 19:28.266
No, not having that, mate.

19:28.267 --> 19:29.626
You... you told...

19:29.627 --> 19:31.346
(QUIETLY) You told Penny Evans

19:31.347 --> 19:34.746
that I rented out my spare room
on BuzzOKs.

19:34.747 --> 19:36.826
- I would never say that.
- Well, you did!

19:36.827 --> 19:38.186
Because you were pissed.

19:38.187 --> 19:40.986
Well, mate, setting the record straight,

19:40.987 --> 19:44.946
I told her guests paid to stay
in your second bedroom.

19:44.947 --> 19:48.426
How is that any different from
what I just fucking said, Frank?

19:48.427 --> 19:52.226
- I never said 'rented'!
- Oh, Mrs God, man!

19:52.227 --> 19:56.106
Penny Evans has blabbed
the whole thing to the media.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.426
She had no right to.
I told her in strictest confidence.

19:58.427 --> 20:01.346
Mate, this is the person
who tried to sue me!

20:01.347 --> 20:03.066
Alright? Do you understa...?

20:03.067 --> 20:06.266
You gave her the one piece
of information that could bury me,

20:06.267 --> 20:09.266
and then you took time out
of your hectic work schedule

20:09.267 --> 20:12.306
to go and verify it
with Caitlin Farquhar.

20:12.307 --> 20:14.146
High profile.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.626
No such thing as bad publicity.

20:15.627 --> 20:17.346
Yes, mate, there is!

20:17.347 --> 20:19.946
There is if it means
that I'm then unemployed

20:19.947 --> 20:22.266
and/or behind bars
for the rest of my days.

20:22.267 --> 20:25.866
- Mate, I hear you. I'll fix it.
- No, you won't, Frank.

20:25.867 --> 20:29.067
You're fired. Alright?
Finish your drink and piss off.

20:40.627 --> 20:41.827
Wendy!

20:41.828 --> 20:43.266
- Hey. (CHUCKLES)
- Oh, hello.

20:43.267 --> 20:45.506
Um, look, uh, I thought
you might like to know,

20:45.507 --> 20:48.266
it looks like your bill
is gonna sail through Parliament.

20:48.267 --> 20:49.427
I've been asking around

20:49.428 --> 20:51.466
and apparently both sides
of the House are gonna support it.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.466
- That's amazing. Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

20:53.467 --> 20:55.026
So, look, I was wondering,

20:55.027 --> 20:56.466
maybe you'd like to, uh, celebrate

20:56.467 --> 20:58.306
and come to the Midwinter Ball with me?

20:58.307 --> 20:59.906
Oh.

20:59.907 --> 21:01.586
Cleaver's actually asked me.

21:01.587 --> 21:03.546
I mean... (LAUGHS) ..not as a date.

21:03.547 --> 21:05.506
I mean, just as a... like,
a recognition of what we...

21:05.507 --> 21:08.346
Cleaver? I thought you were
well and truly over him.

21:08.347 --> 21:10.866
In fact, didn't I go to a book
launch where you said exactly that?

21:10.867 --> 21:12.546
Yes! You did.
It's just that I, you know...

21:12.547 --> 21:14.626
...I spend every day talking
to people about their problems

21:14.627 --> 21:17.306
and I thought, maybe, you know,
Cleaver's not that bad. He's...

21:17.307 --> 21:20.306
Oh! I know, he is that bad.
He's that bad.

21:20.307 --> 21:21.946
He's... Well...

21:21.947 --> 21:25.346
You know what, I'm gonna go with him
this once, and then I'm...

21:25.347 --> 21:26.586
Anyway.

21:26.587 --> 21:28.907
- Thanks for asking.
- Sure.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.067
(SIGHS)

21:37.267 --> 21:39.986
- (TOILET FLUSHES)
- Is everything alright in there?

21:39.987 --> 21:41.227
Yeah?

21:42.307 --> 21:44.226
Thank you. Uh, thank you.

21:44.227 --> 21:46.306
Listen, Your Holiness.

21:46.307 --> 21:51.946
Um, if... if anyone calls you
from a media outlet

21:51.947 --> 21:54.546
or comes at you with a camera
when you go out today,

21:54.547 --> 21:59.826
could you just say
that you are a cousin of mine?

21:59.827 --> 22:01.027
'Coosin'.

22:01.028 --> 22:05.066
Coos... coosin. Yes, you're
my coosin, on my uncle Ken's side.

22:05.067 --> 22:08.346
- Uncle.
- Yes. My uncle Ken.

22:08.347 --> 22:11.546
You, his son, you say.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.746
- Uncle Ken.
- Yes.

22:13.747 --> 22:16.546
My uncle Ken is your father.

22:16.547 --> 22:19.466
- No. Father, Tashi.
- Yes, I know that.

22:19.467 --> 22:22.306
I don't know th...
I don't KNOW that, but I know...

22:22.307 --> 22:24.826
Can we...? Maybe just...
Alright, forget Uncle Ken.

22:24.827 --> 22:27.026
Forget Uncle Ken. This is... No uncle...

22:27.027 --> 22:29.706
You could just say, my...
you and me are cousins.

22:29.707 --> 22:31.866
- Cousins.
- No Uncle Ken?

22:31.867 --> 22:34.147
No Uncle Ken. Cousins.

22:35.507 --> 22:37.866
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

22:37.867 --> 22:40.227
What the fuck? What are you...?

22:45.987 --> 22:47.786
CAITLIN: (ON TV)
The briefing ended abruptly

22:47.787 --> 22:51.106
with the American President denying
he called the Chinese Premier

22:51.107 --> 22:53.306
an "all-time pathetic loser",

22:53.307 --> 22:56.426
stating it was "fake news
from the fake news media".

22:56.427 --> 22:57.866
(CHUCKLES) Fake news.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.666
The bodies of two drowned plumbers

22:59.667 --> 23:01.706
were pulled from a sewer today
in Canberra.

23:01.707 --> 23:05.746
The bodies were identified as
brothers Jake and Gordon Mitherell

23:05.747 --> 23:07.186
from Queanbeyan.

23:07.187 --> 23:10.386
REPORTER: Yes, Caitlin. I'm at the
corner of Durden and Fenley Streets.

23:10.387 --> 23:13.507
Rescue workers have just pulled
two corpses from the drain here.

23:15.507 --> 23:17.307
The toilet's unblocked itself!

23:19.507 --> 23:21.826
The plumbers! You didn't.

23:21.827 --> 23:22.827
You wouldn't.

23:22.828 --> 23:24.546
Have you got an appointment
to see me, Joe?

23:24.547 --> 23:26.706
Fuck you, Gareth. Don't you fuck with me.

23:26.707 --> 23:28.706
OK? When you said
"with extreme prejudice",

23:28.707 --> 23:30.906
please God tell me
you didn't mean that literally.

23:30.907 --> 23:32.067
You wouldn't be so stupid.

23:32.068 --> 23:35.066
Julie! Joe McGregor,
did he make an appointment to see me?

23:35.067 --> 23:36.187
Sorry, Prime Minister?

23:36.188 --> 23:39.147
Joe McGregor, does he have
an appointment to see me?

23:40.307 --> 23:42.106
No, I don't believe he's in the book.

23:42.107 --> 23:43.227
No, he's not, is he?

23:43.228 --> 23:45.027
Thank you very much, Julie.

23:48.507 --> 23:49.986
Oh, you're still here, are you, mate?

23:49.987 --> 23:51.666
You really should
make an appointment to see me.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.706
I'm terribly busy. I'm going through
a Cabinet reshuffle.

23:53.707 --> 23:57.147
You fucking festering little tapeworm.

23:58.547 --> 24:00.266
Arts, Joe. How do you feel about that?

24:00.267 --> 24:01.546
Does it grab you?

24:01.547 --> 24:04.426
Opera tickets, opening nights,
overseeing the usual cuts?

24:04.427 --> 24:05.867
Hmm?

24:09.667 --> 24:12.226
Oh, you are just going to have to man up.

24:12.227 --> 24:14.786
Tell them that you didn't know
anything about it.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.786
What kind of a moron doesn't know

24:16.787 --> 24:19.226
that he's running a hotel
out of his own home?

24:19.227 --> 24:20.307
Squatters?

24:20.308 --> 24:22.066
Oh, right, so I didn't notice them.

24:22.067 --> 24:24.226
You could say that you don't really
bother coming to Canberra.

24:24.227 --> 24:26.866
You travel a lot.
I mean, that's sort of true.

24:26.867 --> 24:29.026
Yeah, the kind of truth
that gets you buried.

24:29.027 --> 24:31.226
What if you say that you've been
sharing it with staff?

24:31.227 --> 24:34.547
I've been OKing there. I mean,
say that Frank got confused.

24:35.347 --> 24:42.026
Yes, I like that. Confusion, staff,
you know, fake news. That's good.

24:42.027 --> 24:44.106
I reckon I might be off the hook.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.346
You think?

24:45.347 --> 24:46.746
Come on, come on!

24:46.747 --> 24:48.826
Where's the vote of confidence?
Where's the esprit de corps?

24:48.827 --> 24:51.426
The old, you know, "Team Cleaver!"?

24:51.427 --> 24:52.866
What's that?

24:52.867 --> 24:54.306
When did that ever exist?

24:54.307 --> 24:55.586
Oh, God.

24:55.587 --> 24:57.426
You... Mate.

24:57.427 --> 25:00.586
I have a television interview.

25:00.587 --> 25:03.226
Yeah, I know you have. Drive.

25:03.227 --> 25:05.586
Oh, I beg your pardon.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.386
I need you to drive.

25:07.387 --> 25:08.706
Yes, I heard, mate.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.586
I mean, do we have a problem here?

25:10.587 --> 25:13.386
Yes. Princess needs me by her side.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.066
I don't know if you're on top of this,

25:15.067 --> 25:17.586
but I am a senator in the Australian...

25:17.587 --> 25:20.706
I have done you a number of favours,
have I not?

25:20.707 --> 25:22.026
Well, yes. Yes.

25:22.027 --> 25:24.586
And now I am trying to buy you
some more time.

25:24.587 --> 25:26.586
What do you mean, buy me time? For what?

25:26.587 --> 25:27.986
Your debt.

25:27.987 --> 25:29.426
Oh, yes. Debt.

25:29.427 --> 25:32.826
So, I need you to drive us
to a veterinary clinic.

25:32.827 --> 25:35.346
Oh, alright.
It's just about the whole tone.

25:35.347 --> 25:38.266
- Just drive!
- Oh, fuck! Oh, God!

25:38.267 --> 25:39.546
I mean, mate.

25:39.547 --> 25:42.627
The bloody viceroyal of Gdansk.

25:45.707 --> 25:47.427
I got this thing, so...

25:47.827 --> 25:50.906
- How are you, Cleave?
- Yeah, good.

25:50.907 --> 25:52.386
How are you?

25:52.387 --> 25:53.746
Been a while since we shared a bed.

25:53.747 --> 25:55.146
How are you doing?

25:55.147 --> 25:57.346
Ah... yeah, very good.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.426
Um... It would be nice
to catch up socially.

26:00.427 --> 26:01.746
Oh, wouldn't that be nice?

26:01.747 --> 26:07.786
Um, so, listen, this, uh... this
BuzzOK thing, that's nothing.

26:07.787 --> 26:09.026
That's nothing.

26:09.027 --> 26:12.306
You know? So... I mean,
can we just deal with the big issues?

26:12.307 --> 26:13.282
Sure.

26:13.283 --> 26:14.882
I mean,
there's a lot going on at the moment.

26:14.883 --> 26:16.746
- The possibility of war. (CHUCKLES)
- Sure.

26:16.747 --> 26:18.386
- You know, global conflict.
- Sure, sure.

26:18.387 --> 26:20.586
There's a lot I'd like to ventilate.

26:20.587 --> 26:22.147
No, I understand. I understand.

26:24.107 --> 26:26.947
Five, four, three...

26:28.667 --> 26:31.294
Senator Cleaver Greene,
lovely to have you with us.

26:31.295 --> 26:32.449
Lovely to be here, Caitlin.

26:32.450 --> 26:33.722
What were you thinking?

26:33.723 --> 26:37.986
BuzzOK guests in an apartment
paid for with taxpayer dollars?

26:37.987 --> 26:40.467
Surely this is against
every conceivable rule?

26:43.387 --> 26:44.507
Fake news.

26:44.508 --> 26:46.226
You're joking.

26:46.227 --> 26:47.387
- Fake news...
- (SCOFFS)

26:47.388 --> 26:49.186
...from a fake news station.

26:49.187 --> 26:51.786
You are denying having paid guests

26:51.787 --> 26:55.986
in accommodation paid for, provided
for, by the taxpayer.

26:55.987 --> 26:57.546
- Fake news.
- Fake news?

26:57.547 --> 26:59.466
Fake news. Fake news.

26:59.467 --> 27:01.586
- There are witnesses.
- Liars.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.506
- You appear on their website.
- All of them, liars.

27:03.507 --> 27:04.627
- There is footage...
- Fake news.

27:04.628 --> 27:06.866
- ...of English backpackers...
- Doctored footage.

27:06.867 --> 27:08.386
- ...wandering in and out.
- Doctored footage.

27:08.387 --> 27:11.186
- Doctored footage?
- Paid for by vested interests.

27:11.187 --> 27:12.866
Is that right? More fake news?

27:12.867 --> 27:14.986
- More fake news.
- More fake news.

27:14.987 --> 27:18.386
Caitlin, you see, this is where
your network has descended to,

27:18.387 --> 27:20.094
and you should be
ashamed of yourselves, really.

27:20.095 --> 27:21.168
We should be ashamed?

27:21.169 --> 27:22.666
There is a world of trouble out there.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.786
The possibility of real global conflict.

27:24.787 --> 27:26.946
- Come on, Senator.
- Conflagration in the South China Sea.

27:26.947 --> 27:28.929
- Did you or did you not...
- And you want to talk about

27:28.930 --> 27:30.826
what's going on in my flat?

27:30.827 --> 27:33.186
- I mean, shame on you.
- Did you receive money from guests?

27:33.187 --> 27:35.946
I have never received a single payment

27:35.947 --> 27:39.866
and I challenge you to find
any bank account in my name...

27:39.867 --> 27:42.266
- In your name?
- ..that has accepted any payments.

27:42.267 --> 27:44.907
Fake, fake, fake...

27:46.107 --> 27:47.506
...news.

27:47.507 --> 27:50.586
That was utter bullshit, Cleave,
even by your standards.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.906
See, I found that quite liberating.

27:52.907 --> 27:56.266
Know what I mean? You just deny it
until it goes away.

27:56.267 --> 27:58.826
The trick is
you have to believe it yourself.

27:58.827 --> 28:00.586
You won't get away with it, you realise.

28:00.587 --> 28:03.266
Well, I can see there's no point
in asking you to stop,

28:03.267 --> 28:05.546
so I guess I'll just keep denying it.

28:05.547 --> 28:09.226
I... could be persuaded to drop it.

28:09.227 --> 28:10.547
How?

28:11.667 --> 28:13.266
Take me to the Midwinter Ball.

28:13.267 --> 28:16.306
- The Midwinter Ball? Why would...
- I like dancing.

28:16.307 --> 28:18.026
Oh, this is about Gareth, isn't it?

28:18.027 --> 28:21.626
It's about the thrill of the ball.

28:21.627 --> 28:26.946
It's about you saying how nice
it would be to see me again.

28:26.947 --> 28:28.906
I've already asked someone else.

28:28.907 --> 28:31.826
Well, then I will run the story,
pictures, interviews.

28:31.827 --> 28:33.706
OK, OK, OK.

28:33.707 --> 28:38.346
I will need it in writing that
you are going to drop the story.

28:38.347 --> 28:40.586
OK? Proper legal writing.

28:40.587 --> 28:44.226
Yeah? Because I trust you
about as far as I can spit,

28:44.227 --> 28:46.146
and I'm a dribbler.

28:46.147 --> 28:48.226
How very romantic.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.907
Oh, I would love to come.

28:57.707 --> 28:59.706
- Psst!
- GARETH: Oh.

28:59.707 --> 29:02.506
Come walk with me.

29:02.507 --> 29:03.786
Does Cal know you're here?

29:03.787 --> 29:05.026
No.

29:05.027 --> 29:06.466
Good, good.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.546
Now, I want you to come and work with me.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.586
No more fucking around
with those McGregors.

29:10.587 --> 29:11.946
I want you to travel the world.

29:11.947 --> 29:17.426
I want you to be my front of house.

29:17.427 --> 29:20.426
- Uh, Gareth, I am working for Cal.
- Mm.

29:20.427 --> 29:23.026
I have sworn
an oath of allegiance to him.

29:23.027 --> 29:24.666
I can't just immediately break that.

29:24.667 --> 29:26.346
How soon could you?

29:26.347 --> 29:27.506
Tomorrow.

29:27.507 --> 29:28.667
Tomorrow, then.

29:28.668 --> 29:34.346
So... which portfolio is it
he most dreads?

29:34.347 --> 29:35.986
Health or Veterans' Affairs?

29:35.987 --> 29:38.146
- Hm?
- I will tell you that tomorrow.

29:38.147 --> 29:40.746
What will you tell me tomorrow?

29:40.747 --> 29:42.746
Tomorrow I will tell you

29:42.747 --> 29:45.906
that he is terrified
you'll give him Veterans' Affairs.

29:45.907 --> 29:48.706
- Mm.
- Alright, you better go now.

29:48.707 --> 29:50.067
Somebody might see you.

29:50.947 --> 29:52.267
Mm.

29:57.227 --> 29:58.387
Oh, shit!

30:00.787 --> 30:02.866
I keep having the same dream, Wendy.

30:02.867 --> 30:06.586
And I don't think it means anything,
but I'm still in the meat union

30:06.587 --> 30:09.986
and we've got the Socialist Alliance
all stitched up.

30:09.987 --> 30:12.466
Everything seems perfect
but, you see, in my dream,

30:12.467 --> 30:13.906
I haven't taken into consideration

30:13.907 --> 30:16.986
the allied steelworkers have stacked
the centre-left Sydney branch

30:16.987 --> 30:19.626
and they want to put up Barry Mangas
as a candidate for preselection.

30:19.627 --> 30:21.546
Don't worry about the ball.

30:21.547 --> 30:22.866
Because I've found someone else.

30:22.867 --> 30:24.227
But we should grab a bite.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.426
- David, hi. Perfect.
- Wendy.

30:32.427 --> 30:34.746
Um... I would love to go to
the ball with you,

30:34.747 --> 30:36.706
if you want me to still, that is?

30:36.707 --> 30:39.026
Well, what about BuzzOKs?

30:39.027 --> 30:40.346
I don't care.

30:40.347 --> 30:43.066
You do realise that
you will never hear the end of this?

30:43.067 --> 30:44.866
- I hope you're prepared for that.
- Yes, I am.

30:44.867 --> 30:46.226
- Good.
- Good.

30:46.227 --> 30:47.546
- Great.
- Perfect.

30:47.547 --> 30:49.467
- See you then.
- Brilliant. Thank you.

31:08.027 --> 31:10.227
Has the 10:45 already come, sir?

31:11.907 --> 31:13.147
Sir?

31:14.787 --> 31:15.987
Hello?

31:17.067 --> 31:18.067
Hey. Hey.

31:19.387 --> 31:20.947
Hello? Sir?

31:22.427 --> 31:23.627
Sir?

31:33.347 --> 31:34.586
Hello.

31:34.587 --> 31:37.587
Hi. Can I get an ambulance?

31:44.187 --> 31:45.467
Psst!

31:49.107 --> 31:50.747
CAL: OK.

31:51.787 --> 31:55.266
I got Clemens, Walters, Papadreyovic,

31:55.267 --> 31:58.466
that bloke from Kyabram, and most of NSW.

31:58.467 --> 32:02.386
You don't have the numbers to
roll him, Cal, and you never will.

32:02.387 --> 32:05.026
- Your brother...
- Half-brother.

32:05.027 --> 32:08.146
...is holding a third of the members.

32:08.147 --> 32:10.506
Without him, you don't stand a show.

32:10.507 --> 32:13.026
OK, so... what are we going to do?

32:13.027 --> 32:16.747
- Well, me, uh... nothing.
- What?

32:17.707 --> 32:19.626
Today is my last day, Cal.

32:19.627 --> 32:20.946
What?

32:20.947 --> 32:22.067
No. Why?

32:22.068 --> 32:23.786
There's no point in trying to
hide it from you,

32:23.787 --> 32:25.387
I'm going to go work for Gareth.

32:26.587 --> 32:28.506
What price loyalty?

32:28.507 --> 32:30.026
Power.

32:30.027 --> 32:32.386
You know that as well as I do, Cal.

32:32.387 --> 32:34.706
This is a knife to my heart.

32:34.707 --> 32:39.586
God. Look, if you're worried that
I'm going to betray confidences,

32:39.587 --> 32:41.426
rest assured, that is not the case.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.386
Please do me the courtesy

32:43.387 --> 32:46.427
of allowing me
some professional integrity.

32:48.787 --> 32:52.586
Besides, if you do get to knife Gareth,

32:52.587 --> 32:54.346
I'm going to be with you all the way.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.507
You know that.

33:02.547 --> 33:03.827
Bitch.

33:05.147 --> 33:08.346
(LAUGHS) Oh, that is beautiful.

33:08.347 --> 33:09.427
I was going to give him Arts,

33:09.428 --> 33:12.266
but Veterans' Affairs,
that is just so right.

33:12.267 --> 33:13.506
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

33:13.507 --> 33:14.826
Yes?

33:14.827 --> 33:17.706
- It's 11. The Chinese Premier's call.
- Oh, yes, right.

33:17.707 --> 33:19.106
Where's my bloke? Bring him in.

33:19.107 --> 33:20.746
- She's here and ready.
- Oh.

33:20.747 --> 33:21.987
Oh, you stay.

33:23.347 --> 33:24.467
Hi.

33:26.947 --> 33:29.587
Right. One. One.

33:33.027 --> 33:34.570
(SPEAKS CHINESE)

33:34.571 --> 33:35.847

33:35.847 --> 33:37.119
_

33:37.120 --> 33:38.614
_

33:38.614 --> 33:40.614
_

33:43.467 --> 33:45.026
Prime Minister...

33:45.027 --> 33:48.067
...I'm feeling some disquiet.

33:49.387 --> 33:52.787
Uh, Mr Premier, I...
(CLEARS THROAT) I am at a loss.

33:52.903 --> 33:54.903
_

33:54.929 --> 33:56.542
_

33:56.543 --> 33:57.920
_

33:58.507 --> 34:00.518
My cousin's son's wedding in Canberra.

34:00.519 --> 34:01.644
What?

34:01.645 --> 34:04.147
There appears to be certain obstacles.

34:09.987 --> 34:15.666
Mr Premier, I had no idea that
marriage was one of your relations.

34:15.667 --> 34:16.875
The marriage.

34:16.876 --> 34:18.876
_

34:20.147 --> 34:22.786
You have shown a degree of discourtesy.

34:22.786 --> 34:24.826
Mr Premier, we can fix this.

34:24.827 --> 34:27.866
We can fix this awful mistake right now.

34:27.867 --> 34:31.699
Perhaps if you could, uh, change
the wedding by a night...

34:31.699 --> 34:33.699
_

34:35.867 --> 34:38.826
I am of a somewhat bellicose disposition.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.545
Oh, Mr Premier, don't be bellicose.

34:40.547 --> 34:43.585
No need for that, sir.
No need whatsoever.

34:43.587 --> 34:45.906
It's just that the Midwinter Ball

34:45.907 --> 34:48.306
is a very important occasion
in this country.

34:48.588 --> 34:50.588
_

34:50.641 --> 34:52.969
_

34:53.067 --> 34:54.346
(WHISPERS) The Americans?

34:54.347 --> 34:55.424
He just mentioned the Americans.

34:55.424 --> 34:57.324
_

34:57.324 --> 34:58.678
_

34:58.679 --> 34:59.900
_

35:00.187 --> 35:03.906
I think you probably got
the gist of that, Prime Minister.

35:03.907 --> 35:06.906
He is bringing the Americans into it.

35:06.907 --> 35:08.975
We can fix this, Mr Premier.
We can fix this.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.129
_

35:10.227 --> 35:12.506
Of course the wedding
must go ahead on that night

35:12.507 --> 35:15.906
and, sir, it would be a privilege
and honour if we were...

35:15.907 --> 35:18.907
- (PHONE DISCONNECTS)
- ..to pay for it.

35:19.907 --> 35:21.827
That bastard Evans.

35:23.187 --> 35:25.066
Christ alive, man,
do you know what you've done?

35:25.067 --> 35:27.306
I've had the Chinese Premier
on the phone.

35:27.307 --> 35:29.266
You've created an international incident!

35:29.267 --> 35:31.306
What in Christ's name
did you say to them?!

35:31.307 --> 35:33.346
I told them
exactly what you told me to say.

35:33.347 --> 35:35.506
"You can take your fucking
tin-pot wedding

35:35.507 --> 35:37.346
"and stick it
up your collective arseholes."

35:37.347 --> 35:38.666
Jesus!

35:38.667 --> 35:42.146
The fact that this man is the
Chinese Premier's cousin's son

35:42.147 --> 35:46.266
didn't make you think that perhaps
you should override that instruction?

35:46.267 --> 35:49.066
I mean, he is the 2IC
for their embassy here!

35:49.067 --> 35:51.347
Nobody told me that.

35:52.187 --> 35:53.706
You told me that the Midwinter Ball

35:53.707 --> 35:55.666
takes precedence over all other bookings.

35:55.667 --> 35:56.867
Alright!

35:58.067 --> 35:59.187
Alright, alright.

35:59.188 --> 36:01.506
Is there anywhere else
in this godforsaken shithole

36:01.507 --> 36:03.986
where we can hold the ball?

36:03.987 --> 36:05.746
We could get some screens.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.706
What the fuck are you talking about?

36:07.707 --> 36:11.227
We could divide the space into two
and make two events.

36:11.947 --> 36:14.346
- What, like side by side?
- Yes.

36:14.347 --> 36:16.106
Two at once.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.467
Exciting.

36:19.867 --> 36:23.226
How do we keep the rest of the media
away from this BuzzOK bullshit?

36:23.227 --> 36:24.267
Cleave...

36:24.268 --> 36:26.506
I'm not looking.

36:26.507 --> 36:28.907
Frank died this morning.

36:32.427 --> 36:34.787
Apparently he had a heart attack.

36:36.267 --> 36:37.667
At a bus stop.

36:39.507 --> 36:41.467
What was he doing at a bus stop?

36:44.907 --> 36:46.986
Where was he going?

36:46.987 --> 36:48.427
I don't know.

36:49.827 --> 36:51.187
No, of course you don't.

36:58.307 --> 36:59.707
Fuck.

37:01.547 --> 37:04.027
I'm sorry, but you've got that meeting.

37:06.147 --> 37:07.706
What?

37:07.707 --> 37:09.467
You've got a meeting.

37:11.987 --> 37:13.307
Cleave?

37:16.187 --> 37:18.227
- Meeting.
- Yeah.

37:21.027 --> 37:26.826
So, now we have cuts to health,
welfare, Aboriginal services,

37:26.827 --> 37:29.026
rural programs, transport.

37:29.027 --> 37:30.466
Is there anything I'm missing?

37:30.467 --> 37:33.946
Also, we might spend money
on protecting ourselves

37:33.947 --> 37:37.826
from the evil spirit that lurks
beneath the blue tarpaulin.

37:37.827 --> 37:41.906
I realise Senator Potter would like
to welcome terrorists to our shore

37:41.907 --> 37:43.626
with an arrival drink,

37:43.627 --> 37:45.986
but this government takes these
matters much more seriously.

37:45.987 --> 37:50.466
The point is, Senator McGregor,
it is now six months down the line

37:50.467 --> 37:53.986
and we are no clearer on
who was behind the explosion,

37:53.987 --> 37:56.266
or even the nature
of the chemical threat to us.

37:56.267 --> 37:58.666
Well, clearly, I'm not going to go
into detailed explanations

37:58.667 --> 38:02.146
on security matters
in an open forum like this,

38:02.147 --> 38:05.706
as much as Senator Potter might
like to assist his terrorist friends.

38:05.707 --> 38:07.466
Who knows if I'd like to assist them?

38:07.467 --> 38:09.507
You failed to produce even one of them!

38:10.547 --> 38:11.946
You tell me what is to stop me

38:11.947 --> 38:14.826
from marching straight over to
new Parliament House right now,

38:14.827 --> 38:16.786
lifting the tarp and walking straight in?

38:16.787 --> 38:18.706
If you'd like to take that risk,
be my guest.

38:18.707 --> 38:22.146
But perhaps you might listen
to our chief scientist Seth Gilbert

38:22.147 --> 38:23.626
before you do that, Senator.

38:23.627 --> 38:29.106
So how long would it normally take
a team of highly trained scientists,

38:29.107 --> 38:31.586
using the most elaborate equipment,

38:31.587 --> 38:34.666
to determine the chemical nature
of a substance?

38:34.667 --> 38:38.546
It's hard to give a specific time frame.

38:38.547 --> 38:42.386
Well, the ex-director of the CSIRO
and a top British expert

38:42.387 --> 38:45.706
told me it would normally take
a day or two.

38:45.707 --> 38:51.626
We are dealing with a very tricky
beast here, something not known.

38:51.627 --> 38:53.546
There was someone else from the CSIRO

38:53.547 --> 38:56.386
who was inside the building
on the day of the explosion,

38:56.387 --> 38:57.986
and they told me it smelt like

38:57.987 --> 39:02.306
a mixture of sodium butyric acid
and butane.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.266
What would that suggest to you?

39:04.267 --> 39:07.226
Any number of things.

39:07.227 --> 39:10.026
(QUIETLY) Make sure we cut CSIRO's
funding again next year.

39:10.027 --> 39:12.706
Would you care to name one?

39:12.707 --> 39:16.346
And Frank's eldest son, Brett,

39:16.347 --> 39:20.346
who, sadly, is caught up
with business in Queensland

39:20.347 --> 39:22.626
and couldn't be with us today,

39:22.627 --> 39:25.626
though I'm sure his spirit is with us.

39:25.627 --> 39:29.266
He said his dad was a lover of fine wine

39:29.267 --> 39:32.666
and often enjoyed a tipple
with old mates.

39:32.667 --> 39:35.706
He also, according to his daughter Janny,

39:35.707 --> 39:38.226
was always up and ready for a laugh

39:38.227 --> 39:40.986
and to lend a hand to those in trouble.

39:40.987 --> 39:44.586
So, that was the Frank we knew.

39:44.587 --> 39:46.307
Are you fucking kidding me?

39:47.587 --> 39:49.027
Holy crap.

39:49.947 --> 39:52.226
That's Frank's life wrapped up, is it?

39:52.227 --> 39:54.186
A tipple, a laugh,

39:54.187 --> 39:57.506
and his son couldn't make it
from Queensland?

39:57.507 --> 39:59.546
(SOBS)

39:59.547 --> 40:01.706
If you have something additional
you wish to say...

40:01.707 --> 40:03.986
Sorry, mate. I don't... I don't even...

40:03.987 --> 40:05.386
I don't even know the man.

40:05.387 --> 40:11.826
But, come on, I mean, the guy walked
the planet for 70-odd years.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.546
I mean, he hated, he loved.

40:13.547 --> 40:15.266
You know, he felt stuff.

40:15.267 --> 40:17.146
He did things.

40:17.147 --> 40:19.066
Jesus Christ.

40:19.067 --> 40:22.507
Enjoyed a tipple
and was good for a laugh.

40:23.867 --> 40:25.746
I mean, if Frank had have known
as a little kid

40:25.747 --> 40:29.186
it was going to end
like this miserable farce,

40:29.187 --> 40:30.386
he wouldn't have bothered.

40:30.387 --> 40:31.427
(SOBS)

40:31.428 --> 40:32.786
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:32.787 --> 40:34.387
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.746
I don't... I don't mean to...

40:37.747 --> 40:41.426
I... I'll tell you what
I do remember about your old man.

40:41.427 --> 40:43.626
OK? This is your old man.

40:43.627 --> 40:46.506
I'm this little kid, OK,

40:46.507 --> 40:49.626
and it's '69 and I am at the grand final.

40:49.627 --> 40:51.866
Balmain and Souths, alright?

40:51.867 --> 40:54.946
And my Bunnies
are up by two points, yeah?

40:54.947 --> 40:58.346
And Talbot goes off injured for Balmain

40:58.347 --> 41:01.306
and your old man, who hadn't got a go
all season, alright,

41:01.307 --> 41:05.026
he comes on as the emergency,
and there are two minutes to go.

41:05.027 --> 41:10.386
And your old man intercepts a Souths
pass and he starts running

41:10.387 --> 41:14.226
and he runs and he fends off
three of our tackles.

41:14.227 --> 41:16.226
He's out there, he's got no support.

41:16.227 --> 41:17.586
He's got no-one to pass it to

41:17.587 --> 41:22.186
and he's got every player on my team
hunting the man down.

41:22.187 --> 41:25.266
And there are 10 seconds to go.

41:25.267 --> 41:31.906
And Marlow makes this last-minute
diving, desperate tackle,

41:31.907 --> 41:39.747
and your old man, he leaps
five feet in the air, and he flies.

41:41.427 --> 41:43.147
He flies...

41:44.587 --> 41:46.867
...and he planted the bloody thing.

41:47.907 --> 41:49.147
And he buried us.

41:50.147 --> 41:52.266
And I hated him.

41:52.267 --> 41:53.907
Hated the bastard.

41:55.387 --> 41:56.867
But I loved him.

41:58.427 --> 42:04.546
And I... I've never seen anything
before or since

42:04.547 --> 42:06.867
that held a candle to it. Alright?

42:10.507 --> 42:12.227
So, he did that.

42:31.347 --> 42:34.106
Jesus, Joe. Health!

42:34.107 --> 42:35.586
That's going to kill you.

42:35.587 --> 42:38.586
And you helped the man
get the job in the first place.

42:38.587 --> 42:41.706
Loyalty in this place is thinner
than a bad hair transplant.

42:41.707 --> 42:42.787
Oh.

42:42.788 --> 42:44.946
Are you sure we don't have
the numbers to roll him?

42:44.947 --> 42:46.906
Well, you and your brother...

42:46.907 --> 42:48.466
Fuck, really? How many more times?

42:48.467 --> 42:51.066
Fuck. OK, half. Half-brother.

42:51.067 --> 42:53.267
You have split the party. OK?

42:54.627 --> 42:55.866
He's got more.

42:55.867 --> 42:58.506
Well, at the moment, you own
most of them, but not enough.

43:06.267 --> 43:07.786
I'm not here about the bloody painting.

43:07.787 --> 43:09.707
We need to talk about the next PM.

43:14.707 --> 43:18.746
That private school twat
has shafted us both.

43:18.747 --> 43:20.626
Yeah, word is you're getting Health.

43:20.627 --> 43:23.186
Yeah, and you're getting
Veterans' Affairs and the Arts.

43:23.187 --> 43:25.186
Oh, fuck! Not the Arts as well.

43:25.187 --> 43:27.906
And he's made that no-gonad Newell
party whip.

43:27.907 --> 43:30.066
And he can only do this
because we hate each other.

43:30.067 --> 43:31.946
Well, that's the first thing
he's got right.

43:31.947 --> 43:34.986
And he knows thatwe will never rise
again, unless...

43:34.987 --> 43:36.187
Unless what?

43:36.188 --> 43:37.626
Unless we work together, Cal.

43:37.627 --> 43:39.546
Well, that's not happen, Joe.

43:39.547 --> 43:41.786
What if I throw you my numbers?

43:41.787 --> 43:44.027
- (SCOFFS)
- Make you Prime Minister?

43:47.747 --> 43:50.106
(CHUCKLES) You wouldn't do it.

43:50.107 --> 43:51.826
You made me Treasurer.

43:51.827 --> 43:54.786
And you give me that back.

43:55.415 --> 43:57.346
Then you can become PM.

43:57.347 --> 43:59.226
You ask too much.

43:59.227 --> 44:01.106
He'll do it.

44:01.107 --> 44:03.586
And you sign a legal document

44:03.587 --> 44:06.386
relinquishing all future claims to it.

44:06.387 --> 44:07.626
I'll get a pen.

44:07.627 --> 44:09.306
- No, I can't.
- You will.

44:09.307 --> 44:10.946
- It's too much!
- Alright.

44:10.947 --> 44:13.426
Then I'll throw my numbers
behind Matt Teller.

44:13.427 --> 44:14.267
Well, HE won't get there.

44:14.268 --> 44:17.986
No, but without me, neither will you.

44:17.987 --> 44:22.266
And the rest of your political days
will be spent at RSL functions,

44:22.267 --> 44:24.866
explaining why it's necessary
to make cutbacks

44:24.867 --> 44:26.546
to service pensions and opera nights.

44:26.547 --> 44:27.946
What colour do you want?

44:27.947 --> 44:29.467
I...

44:31.147 --> 44:32.946
- Prime minister, Cal.
- It's my painting.

44:32.947 --> 44:34.747
- Prime minister.
- Mmm.

44:35.787 --> 44:37.227
- Black.
- Ugh!

45:16.507 --> 45:17.747
Good evening.

45:19.267 --> 45:21.706
A touch unusual, isn't it?

45:21.707 --> 45:23.386
You look very beautiful.

45:23.387 --> 45:24.946
Yes, you look...

45:24.947 --> 45:27.146
- ...you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

45:27.147 --> 45:30.227
- The dress is Vengani.
- Well picked.

45:34.307 --> 45:35.907
Cuttin' my lunch a bit, huh?

45:41.667 --> 45:43.267
And the shoes are Carmetti?

45:44.907 --> 45:46.426
Right again. Who are you?

45:46.427 --> 45:51.827
I'm his driver, and you are
the beautiful Caitlin Farquhar.

45:54.147 --> 45:55.147
Drive, Cleaver.

46:00.267 --> 46:02.426
You know, I like to drive myself
every now and then.

46:02.427 --> 46:05.746
It's a kind of egalitarian thing.

I don't like to get too above myself.

46:14.947 --> 46:17.666

- Yes, I would.

So, I'll come and meet you here
at, say, midnight?

- OK. OK. Out we get.
- Perhaps we can...

46:45.227 --> 46:48.026

- Oh, great.

- I mean, how...
- Or... or I could make us an omelette.

46:52.627 --> 46:54.026
- Yum.
- Oh, an omelette.

- Cleaver.

- Rebecca. Hello.
- Oh, what a wonderful name.

Rebecca. Rebecca.

47:57.707 --> 47:59.986
Becca. That is such a lovely name.

47:59.987 --> 48:03.906
Why is it that I never hear you use
Rebecca's name, Prime Minister?

48:03.907 --> 48:08.306
Well, I think it's basically because
we like to keep our private life,

48:08.307 --> 48:09.746
um... private. Mmm.

- Oh, fuck. Uh, well, um...

I've been having trouble
masturbating, if you must know.

49:18.827 --> 49:20.786
No, I mustn't know that.

49:20.787 --> 49:22.026
Yes, I don't know what that is.

49:22.027 --> 49:25.586
I think it's symptomatic of a... you
know, a deeper thing at work there.

49:25.587 --> 49:27.507
I wouldn't have thought so. Mm.

49:29.627 --> 49:30.627

Who's Frank?

49:36.347 --> 49:37.746

- Oh, Cleave, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

49:42.468 --> 49:45.306
And there was something about
his death, and I can't...

49:45.307 --> 49:49.946
Well, actually, there was nothing
about his death, is the point.

49:49.947 --> 49:53.866
It was like a funeral for 10...
you know, kind of...

49:53.867 --> 49:57.666
I don't know, it's just that
now you're here, now you're not.

49:57.667 --> 49:59.826
- No family?
- Well, there's a daughter.

49:59.827 --> 50:01.706
You know, she's...

50:01.707 --> 50:03.786
Ugh, fuck, no.

50:03.787 --> 50:06.266
Come on, let's... She's... she's from
a previous marriage.

50:06.267 --> 50:07.427
At least she turned up.

50:07.428 --> 50:09.986
The son was, um...
you know, terribly busy.

50:09.987 --> 50:14.226
I don't know. You get this tiny
little timeshare on the planet,

50:14.227 --> 50:15.786
in which we all gallop around

50:15.787 --> 50:19.466
fretting about
our quarterly tax statements

50:19.467 --> 50:22.346
and, you know, the price
of three-bedroom terraces,

50:22.347 --> 50:23.427
and you join clubs

50:23.428 --> 50:25.826
and have all these dinners
with people you don't like,

50:25.827 --> 50:27.786
and then, bang, that's it.

50:27.787 --> 50:30.906
Or am I...
you know, am I missing something?

50:30.907 --> 50:32.946
I think... Sorry, this is related to
the masturbation thing?

50:32.947 --> 50:37.386
Well, yes. I mean, it's all...
you know, it's the fading.

50:37.387 --> 50:38.986
You know, it's the evanescence.

50:38.987 --> 50:41.266
- Right, OK.
- The fading out of things, isn't it?

50:41.267 --> 50:43.866
I mean, I don't know.
I think about my friendships.

50:43.867 --> 50:47.306
You know, Barney,
if I want to see Barney now,

50:47.307 --> 50:49.586
I've got to go to Sardinia
and buy a book.

50:50.797 --> 50:53.426
And then there's Scarlett.

50:53.427 --> 50:54.427
Scarlett.

50:56.307 --> 51:02.347
And you. Fuzz. There's a bit of
fading going on, or something.

51:03.427 --> 51:04.866
- Oh, my God. This'll be interesting.
- Oh!

51:04.867 --> 51:06.186
- Hello, Wendy.
- Hello, sister.

51:06.187 --> 51:08.107
- Fuck off, Cleaver.
- Oh, fuck off... You fuck off.

51:09.307 --> 51:11.186

In Taiwan, saving the world, are you?

51:16.507 --> 51:19.746
- No, no, no... Now, now...
- You're a miserable little man.

51:19.747 --> 51:21.546
Hear me out. There was a change of plans.

51:21.547 --> 51:23.146
Now, I tried to call you,
but I think there's...

51:23.147 --> 51:24.906
...there's something wrong with
the broadband or...

51:24.907 --> 51:25.947
Oh, shove it.

51:25.948 --> 51:28.706

the night is just perfect.

You got my message. You're here.

Perfect. You look absolutely radiant.

Get me a drink, Cal.

51:38.067 --> 51:40.546
Uh... well, perhaps a mineral water,
sweetness.

51:40.547 --> 51:43.026
A martini, and another martini.

51:43.027 --> 51:44.466
Right.

51:44.467 --> 51:46.506
Jane, could I have a quick word
with your husband?

51:46.507 --> 51:48.067
Oh, you can do what you like with him.

51:49.187 --> 51:51.706
- You invited her.
- Get used to it, hey?

51:51.707 --> 51:55.186
Nothing changes here
except our titles, alright?

51:55.187 --> 51:57.546
- Fair enough.
- Now, listen.

51:57.547 --> 52:00.186
- Are you sure of your numbers?
- Mm-hm.

52:00.187 --> 52:02.107
- Are you?
- I think we're on.

52:03.827 --> 52:04.827
When? When?

52:04.828 --> 52:07.706
You can topple him tonight,
if you want. Or tomorrow.

52:07.707 --> 52:10.666
Look, I'm just going to go
and get my people sorted out.

52:10.667 --> 52:12.906
You go and get yours.
Let's get it out of here, OK,

52:12.907 --> 52:14.986
unless you want to spend some
quality time with your wife.

52:14.987 --> 52:15.987
Mate, fuck that.

52:25.107 --> 52:27.186
- What's happening?
- She's talking to Cleaver again.

52:27.187 --> 52:28.786
- Who?
- He's her fucking ex-husband.

52:28.787 --> 52:31.907
Oh, bugger them. No, why are people
leaving the room... quickly?

52:33.707 --> 52:35.706
Oh, shit.

52:35.707 --> 52:36.986
- It's a coup.
- Fuck me sideways.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.706
- It's a fucking coup.
- Oh...

52:38.707 --> 52:41.226
Um... You, you. I, uh...

52:41.227 --> 52:43.226
You, darling, I have to go.

52:43.227 --> 52:45.186
And... and when was this?

52:45.187 --> 52:46.707
Shit, something big's on.

52:59.627 --> 53:00.867
Vlad, please come and pick me up.

53:01.907 --> 53:04.147
No, he'll be sleeping elsewhere tonight.

53:05.387 --> 53:07.226
I'm really sorry. I'll be right back.

53:07.227 --> 53:09.186
Yeah? Something's going on. What's...

53:09.187 --> 53:11.506
Oh, no, that's just another
leadership spill.

53:11.507 --> 53:13.106
It's the two plumbers.

53:13.107 --> 53:14.267
What about the two plumbers?

53:14.268 --> 53:16.466
I don't know. Something big.

53:16.467 --> 53:17.986
Oh.

53:17.987 --> 53:19.386
Oh, well, this is, uh...

53:19.387 --> 53:21.506
...I mean, this is truly shithouse,
isn't it?

53:21.507 --> 53:23.066
- Mmm, not good.
- What a...

53:23.067 --> 53:27.706
What a marvellous... death by music.

53:27.707 --> 53:29.426
Or perhaps the death OF music.

53:29.427 --> 53:31.866
You know what? That has... that has
always been your problem.

53:31.867 --> 53:33.346
- Do you realise that?
- What?

53:33.347 --> 53:35.146
- Death.
- What do you mean?

53:35.147 --> 53:36.826
Bullshit. I don't have a problem
with death.

53:36.827 --> 53:38.386
Oh, my God. You give so many shits
about death.

53:38.387 --> 53:40.186
- I don't.
- You're completely haunted by it.

53:40.187 --> 53:44.786
Rubbish. How can you be haunted
by it when it hasn't happened, huh?

53:44.787 --> 53:45.947
Do you see?

53:45.948 --> 53:48.186
No, you've got this... you've got
this sort of morbid fear

53:48.187 --> 53:49.506
- of being irrelevant.
- No, I don't.

53:49.507 --> 53:51.386
You do! That's why you act
the way you do.

53:51.387 --> 53:53.306
You run around like
a chook with its head cut off,

53:53.307 --> 53:54.946
terrified you're going to miss out
on something.

53:54.947 --> 53:58.346
But what you don't realise, Cleave,
is that by not OKing still,

53:58.347 --> 54:00.867
nothing real knows where to find you.

54:02.187 --> 54:05.466
See, I think it's more a sort of
wanking issue.

54:05.467 --> 54:06.467
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:07.747 --> 54:09.506
I'm going to spoil the surprise.

54:09.507 --> 54:10.427
You are going to die.

54:10.428 --> 54:12.186
You are going to be forgotten,

54:12.187 --> 54:13.267
just like everybody else.

54:14.827 --> 54:17.386
I'm really tired. I'm going to go home.

54:17.387 --> 54:20.226
Oh, hey. Come on, what about a...

54:20.227 --> 54:23.706
Come on, how about a little dance,
for old times' sake?

54:23.707 --> 54:25.586
Come on, to this shithouse music.

54:25.587 --> 54:27.706
- It's... They're playing our song.
- (LAUGHS)

54:27.707 --> 54:28.867
- Come on.
- One.

54:28.868 --> 54:30.226
Come on, put down your lady bits and...

54:30.227 --> 54:33.427
MAN: OK, let's keep this party
going with the Fandango Singers!

54:35.787 --> 54:38.107
(BAND SCATS)

54:41.747 --> 54:43.266
- (CHUCKLES)
- Oh...

54:43.267 --> 54:44.626
OK, no last dance.

54:44.627 --> 54:46.386
- Oh, my God.
- I'm going to go.

54:46.387 --> 54:48.226
Oh, no. This...

54:48.227 --> 54:50.066
Don't leave me here.

54:50.067 --> 54:51.427
Oh, God. Oh, hey!

54:53.747 --> 54:55.747
You'd come to my funeral, wouldn't you?

54:56.867 --> 54:57.867
If I'm not busy that day.

55:07.267 --> 55:09.267
(ALL CONTINUE SCATTING)

55:34.107 --> 55:36.587
- Fuck off, Cleaver.
- Oh, you fuck off.

56:13.587 --> 56:16.267
WOMAN: Aunty. It's so lovely to see you.

56:33.987 --> 56:37.106
The Federal Liberal Party
last night bestowed upon me

56:37.107 --> 56:38.586
the enormous honour

56:38.587 --> 56:40.026
of its leadership.

56:40.027 --> 56:42.906
(LAUGHS) Darling!

56:42.907 --> 56:44.706
This is your notice to quit.

56:44.707 --> 56:47.266
You can't do this. I'm a senator!

56:47.267 --> 56:50.946
Your theory is that this was
basically sloppy maintenance,

56:50.947 --> 56:53.226
made to look like a terrorist attack?

56:53.227 --> 56:55.586
He doesn't care
if he gets it into evidence.

56:55.587 --> 56:57.266
He's just going to put on his circus act,

56:57.267 --> 56:58.427
and all the press will cover it.

56:58.428 --> 57:00.786
Half the money or half a finger.

57:00.787 --> 57:04.107
Half a finger? What are you,
fucking Tony Soprano now?
