[GROANS]

01:17.234 --> 01:18.567
[SIGHS]

01:20.033 --> 01:22.033
What's the first derivative
of kinetic energy

01:22.033 --> 01:23.434
with respect
to velocity?

01:23.434 --> 01:25.267
I don't know.

01:26.567 --> 01:28.634
What goes "quack"?

01:34.701 --> 01:36.133
I don't know.

01:42.868 --> 01:43.934
Ahem.

01:43.934 --> 01:46.601
Ahem!

01:46.601 --> 01:48.033
Hey, kids.

01:48.033 --> 01:49.968
Put away your stupid
homework for a minute

01:49.968 --> 01:52.334
and look at Mommy.

01:52.334 --> 01:55.100
She's going out
with her man tonight.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.734
Where should we
tell Dad you went?

01:58.734 --> 02:02.067
It's your father
I'm going out with.

02:02.067 --> 02:06.033
<i>At least he cared enough
to remember my birthday,</i>

02:06.033 --> 02:08.133
which is more than Ican say
for certain two people

02:08.133 --> 02:11.400
who sprang painfully,
and in some cases,

02:11.400 --> 02:14.734
backwards from my loins.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.434
We would've gotten
you something,

02:18.434 --> 02:19.434
but last year
you said,

02:19.434 --> 02:20.701
"If I ever start
to look as old

02:20.701 --> 02:22.267
"as Mrs. McKelvey
across the street

02:22.267 --> 02:24.634
I never wanna have
a birthday again."

02:25.601 --> 02:28.534
Mrs. McKelvey is 50.

02:31.801 --> 02:36.367
Just wait till I find out
when your birthdays are.

02:37.267 --> 02:38.901
Mine's in February.

02:38.901 --> 02:41.000
I'm an Aquarium.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.200
And an empty one.

02:49.801 --> 02:51.267
Where's Dad
takin' you?

02:51.267 --> 02:52.400
Oh, I don't know.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.868
He just said to wear
something special.

02:54.868 --> 02:58.534
Gee, I hope it's dinner
and dancing at the Beef Trough.

02:58.534 --> 03:00.167
That's our place, you know.

03:00.167 --> 03:02.234
[LAUGHS]

03:04.701 --> 03:06.501
Peg...

03:06.501 --> 03:08.267
you look fabulous!

03:08.267 --> 03:11.534
You're gonna knock 'em dead
at the bowling alley.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.400
The bowling alley?

03:15.400 --> 03:17.701
You're taking me bowling
on my birthday?

03:17.701 --> 03:20.701
It's your birthday?

03:20.701 --> 03:24.434
Kids, tonight Mommy
rides in the front seat.

03:25.501 --> 03:27.000
Uh, hey, what're
you kids doin'?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.968
Homework.
Got finals comin' up.

03:28.968 --> 03:31.734
Well, put it away. This is
something really important.

03:31.734 --> 03:32.734
Now...

03:32.734 --> 03:34.167
as we all know,

03:34.167 --> 03:36.634
my good friend Puggy Weaver
is leaving the neighborhood.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.767
So this is my last chance
to break his alley record

03:38.767 --> 03:42.634
in front of his sweaty,
pork-like little face.

03:42.634 --> 03:44.100
I've been training
for weeks,

03:44.100 --> 03:45.767
avoiding anything
that would hurt me:

03:45.767 --> 03:48.234
red meat, red wine...

03:48.234 --> 03:50.367
redheads.

03:51.534 --> 03:55.167
And those energy-draining
showers.

03:55.167 --> 03:59.033
Behind every successful man
is a woman who didn't marry me.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.100
Now, you,
my children,

04:03.100 --> 04:04.300
have the important task

04:04.300 --> 04:06.234
of recording my victory
for posterity.

04:06.234 --> 04:07.767
Too many a great
Bundy moment

04:07.767 --> 04:09.434
has been lost
for lack of a camera.

04:09.434 --> 04:12.267
Oh, honey, we had a camera
on our honeymoon.

04:12.267 --> 04:15.400
You just kept
beating the flash.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.466
Well, Peg, if you recall,

04:19.466 --> 04:23.100
I was doing fine till
you came into the room.

04:25.601 --> 04:27.133
Come on, Peg.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.400
<i>This'll be the first birthday
you begin in an alley.</i>

04:31.467 --> 04:32.634
Kids, get
the cameras.

04:32.634 --> 04:34.133
Peg, get my ball.

04:34.133 --> 04:36.534
Al,
it's my birthday.

04:36.534 --> 04:38.033
You're right.
I'll carry the ball.

04:38.033 --> 04:39.133
You go push-start the car.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.133
Let's go!

04:40.133 --> 04:41.133
Let's go!

04:47.567 --> 04:48.834
Ready, Dad.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.300
AL:
I'm entering!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.734
Widen.

04:53.734 --> 04:55.200
Widen.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.501
Did you get your mother?

04:56.501 --> 04:57.501
Yeah, Dad.

04:57.501 --> 04:59.300
Rewind.

05:02.267 --> 05:03.567
Hi.

05:03.567 --> 05:05.467
I'm Al Bundy at Jim's Bowlarama.

05:05.467 --> 05:08.634
Feelin' good, feelin' spry.

05:08.634 --> 05:09.801
What have we here?

05:09.801 --> 05:11.033
A plaque,

05:11.033 --> 05:13.334
which denotes the highest game
in Bowlarama history,

05:13.334 --> 05:16.801
a plaque which will
soon read, "Al Bundy."

05:16.801 --> 05:17.834
Yep.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.133
<i>Al Bundy, Al Bundy</i>

05:23.567 --> 05:25.434
<i>And long live his glory</i>

05:25.434 --> 05:28.400
<i>Long may his story be told</i>

05:28.400 --> 05:29.567
Still picture, please.

05:35.767 --> 05:36.934
Daddy, help.

05:36.934 --> 05:38.734
I'm blind!

05:38.734 --> 05:40.934
Let us bowl!

05:42.234 --> 05:43.300

05:43.300 --> 05:45.000

[SNIFFING]

05:49.701 --> 05:52.734
Somethin'
die in here?

05:52.734 --> 05:54.601
Oh. Bundy.

05:54.601 --> 05:55.601
Puggy.

05:55.601 --> 05:57.033
I didn't
recognize you

05:57.033 --> 06:00.634
with your fist
out of your nose.

06:00.634 --> 06:02.234
So I understand
you're leavin' town.

06:02.234 --> 06:04.367
I guess you'll be
packin' up the wife, kids,

06:04.367 --> 06:08.968
and the 300-pound hooker you
visit every Friday after work.

06:08.968 --> 06:10.234
So I just stopped by

06:10.234 --> 06:12.000
to give you a little
goin'-away present.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.601
Al "The King" Bundy

06:13.601 --> 06:15.400
will now do
to your record

06:15.400 --> 06:17.701
what time has done
to your face.

06:20.734 --> 06:21.834
Peg...

06:21.834 --> 06:23.267
unzip it.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.467
The bag, Peg.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.133
There's a spot
on my ball.

06:33.133 --> 06:34.133
Peg!

06:39.100 --> 06:42.067
Sorry, girls.
He's taken.

07:08.701 --> 07:12.000
Well, it's gonna be
a long evening, Mom.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.667
You want me to order
a couple of beers?

07:16.868 --> 07:18.501
For you, and, uh,

07:18.501 --> 07:21.133
some ice cream
with gummy bears for me?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.367
Stee-rike!

07:35.067 --> 07:37.868
Still a long way
to 256, Bundy.

07:37.868 --> 07:39.901
Not for your wife, Puggy.

07:41.968 --> 07:42.968
Al,

07:42.968 --> 07:44.601
I'm bored.

07:44.601 --> 07:46.167
Peg, this is
a bowling alley.

07:46.167 --> 07:48.300
Surely you can find
something to do?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.367
Well, I just
can't decide.

07:50.367 --> 07:51.434
Let's see.

07:51.434 --> 07:55.367
Tennis, baccarat,
chamber music.

07:55.367 --> 07:56.467
Oh, I know.

07:56.467 --> 07:58.934
Maybe those gentlemen
scratching their behinds

07:58.934 --> 08:01.901
are having a poetry reading.

08:01.901 --> 08:03.901
Peg, bowl!

08:03.901 --> 08:05.634
Oh, yeah, that would
look really great.

08:05.634 --> 08:07.167
There is nothing
more pathetic

08:07.167 --> 08:10.000
than a woman
who bowls alone.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.934
[SIGHS]

08:13.934 --> 08:16.334
Well, here
we are again.

08:18.434 --> 08:19.634
Peggy!

08:19.634 --> 08:21.200
Oh!

08:23.200 --> 08:25.267
This isn't as pitiful
as it seems.

08:25.267 --> 08:26.667
Well, actually,

08:26.667 --> 08:28.701
I was told this is
a good place to meet men.

08:28.701 --> 08:30.000
And it is.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.467
Why, just last week,
I met two guys.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.734
Of course,
they left together.

08:35.701 --> 08:38.267
Yep, the single life
for me.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.400
Oh, yeah.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.167
This is the place
to find a good one.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.567
You know,
there's nothing wrong

08:42.567 --> 08:45.100
with dating a doctor
or a lawyer,

08:45.100 --> 08:47.934
but when you are really ready
to settle down...

08:47.934 --> 08:49.167
[CHUCKLES]

08:57.501 --> 09:00.501
...you can't beat
a bowler.

09:03.434 --> 09:05.267
With grim
determination,

09:05.267 --> 09:07.234
Bundy picks up
his ball,

09:07.234 --> 09:09.267
knowing all he needs
is two strikes

09:09.267 --> 09:11.300
and eight little pins

09:11.300 --> 09:13.868
and a certain pork pie's record
is history.

09:15.968 --> 09:18.968
Oh, there is no joy
in Pugville.

09:20.901 --> 09:23.934
Mighty Bundy
shall strike out.

09:23.934 --> 09:26.534
Just bowl, shoemeister.

09:26.534 --> 09:27.534
Al, honey,

09:27.534 --> 09:30.334
I just bowled
four strikes in a row.

09:30.334 --> 09:32.200
Shut up, Peg.

09:35.734 --> 09:37.801
Stee-rike!

09:46.634 --> 09:48.734
Honey, this really
is so exciting.

09:48.734 --> 09:50.534
I mean, four strikes
in a row!

09:50.534 --> 09:52.033
I've never
done that before.

09:52.033 --> 09:53.367
Come on, you gotta
come see.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.634
Peg, this is
your birthday,

09:54.634 --> 09:57.501
please don't make me
kill you.

09:57.501 --> 09:59.000
Okay, okay.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.901
I'll be quiet.

10:04.667 --> 10:05.701
Honey?

10:05.701 --> 10:07.367
Huh?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.467
Uh-oh.

10:14.467 --> 10:15.701
Uh-oh!

10:15.701 --> 10:17.767
A 2-4-10 split.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.000
You gotta pick all them up
and bowl a strike

10:20.000 --> 10:21.634
if you wanna
break my record.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.267
What did you want,
Peg?

10:28.501 --> 10:31.234
Well, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

10:31.234 --> 10:32.934
Away, woman!

10:44.067 --> 10:47.000
One more strike to go!

10:47.701 --> 10:50.334
PEG:
Stee-rike!

10:50.334 --> 10:51.901
Ah, heh.

10:53.534 --> 10:55.334
Are you ready,
Bud?

10:55.334 --> 10:56.367
Ready,

10:56.367 --> 10:58.000

11:08.634 --> 11:11.200
Good girl, Kelly.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.234
I'm so happy!

Nothing can ruin
this moment.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.033
Hey, the broad
in the gown

11:44.033 --> 11:45.968
just bowled
six strikes in a row!

11:54.868 --> 11:57.267
You've got six strikes
in a row, Peggy.

11:57.267 --> 12:00.267
Gee, I wonder what
the Bowlarama record is.

12:00.267 --> 12:01.801
Uh, Peg.
I'm done.

12:01.801 --> 12:03.334
We can go
home now.

12:04.734 --> 12:06.234
She can't go now.

12:06.234 --> 12:09.834
She's bowling
a once-in-a-lifetime game.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.234
Yeah, Dad.
Look.

12:11.234 --> 12:14.801
I mean, three more strikes
and your record's history.

12:16.934 --> 12:19.234
Could you, sweat
this way, please?

12:24.601 --> 12:27.434
Al, wouldn't it be great
if I broke your record?

12:27.434 --> 12:28.434
[LAUGHS]

12:28.434 --> 12:29.767
Oh, man.

12:29.767 --> 12:33.200
That'd be the icing
on the tombstone.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.434
Any tips
for tomorrow's losers?

12:35.434 --> 12:37.567
I hope someone's
filming you

12:37.567 --> 12:40.534
during the reading
of my will.

12:40.534 --> 12:42.501
Ah, who cares?
I'm not worried.

12:42.501 --> 12:44.968
Bud, your mother
has a 60 average,

12:44.968 --> 12:46.701
just like
in high school.

12:46.701 --> 12:48.701
There's no way she could
possibly continue to--

12:48.701 --> 12:49.834
MARCIE:
Strike!

12:49.834 --> 12:51.033
Throw strikes.

12:51.033 --> 12:53.434
See, what you gotta know
about bowling

12:53.434 --> 12:55.901
is that anybody can make
a lucky shot.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.567
But over the long run,
the game is set up

12:58.567 --> 13:00.067
so only
the truly skillful--
