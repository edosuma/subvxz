WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:12.079
You are using bad laws

00:12.080 --> 00:15.039
to make sure no-one can say anything

00:15.040 --> 00:16.909
you do not want to hear.

00:17.640 --> 00:18.920
Repeal them.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.119
You have already done that for me.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.839
You gave me no choice.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.320
Nor you me.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.359
We are one people now,

00:39.360 --> 00:42.031
and anyone who highlights
the difference between us

00:42.056 --> 00:43.159
is creating division.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.559
And anyone who refuses
to inform the people

00:46.560 --> 00:49.959
of their complete history
is doing the same.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.959
And where there's division,
conflict will always follow.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.120
Always.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.280
We have a duty to memory.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.068
If I were you, you know what I would do?

01:03.804 --> 01:05.483
Tell them now.

01:05.559 --> 01:07.358
Everything.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.359
Now, when the going is good.

01:10.719 --> 01:12.599
Now, when they do not care.

01:13.599 --> 01:15.519
Before it is too late...

01:17.119 --> 01:19.238
and they blame you...

01:19.239 --> 01:20.519
for everything.

01:21.639 --> 01:24.279
You expect me to take your advice?

01:25.919 --> 01:27.159
You have before.

01:29.719 --> 01:31.148
You see this?

01:31.719 --> 01:34.758
We pretend
it's because I can't hear anything.

01:34.759 --> 01:35.958
It's not.

01:35.959 --> 01:38.548
It is to stop me from having those fits.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.359
They have returned?

01:40.612 --> 01:41.652
Yes.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.198
Maybe it is the guilty conscience.

01:49.199 --> 01:51.758
Yes, well, it has been said.

01:51.759 --> 01:53.318
But I think it is most likely linked

01:53.319 --> 01:56.039
to seeing my dead family
floating around in a river.

01:57.788 --> 02:00.478
Actually,
the last time I had it as a child,

02:00.479 --> 02:01.559
I was with you,

02:02.068 --> 02:06.038
sitting on that bank,
surrounded by dead cattle, remember?

02:06.039 --> 02:08.238
They'd been poisoned by the water,

02:08.239 --> 02:12.318
and everyone was screaming at me
for letting them go down there.

02:12.319 --> 02:14.278
And I took the blame because you...

02:14.279 --> 02:16.799
told me it was the only thing to do.

02:17.959 --> 02:20.959
Let them believe it was
the strange white-eyed girl.

02:22.079 --> 02:23.838
Even though you and I,

02:23.839 --> 02:27.439
we both know it wasn't me
who led them there to drink.

02:29.588 --> 02:33.199
That was the last time
I took your advice.

02:33.379 --> 02:35.379
I won't be taking it again.

02:41.279 --> 02:43.238
You see?

02:43.239 --> 02:46.107
Everyone has bits of their past
they choose to forget.

02:55.038 --> 02:56.238
Even you.

04:15.952 --> 04:16.992
Here.

04:19.031 --> 04:20.192
And the wreckage?

04:21.512 --> 04:23.031
Way, way away...

04:23.032 --> 04:24.552
into the forest.

04:25.911 --> 04:27.031
"Edward Holt."

04:28.351 --> 04:29.751
"41 years old."

04:31.031 --> 04:34.630
We only found it because the farmers
are burning for crops.

04:34.631 --> 04:36.990
Please, get it restored.

04:36.991 --> 04:38.790
Whatever you do,

04:38.791 --> 04:41.151
the forest will always take it back.

04:41.706 --> 04:43.271
Always.

04:44.871 --> 04:46.511
Doesn't mean we should forget.

04:49.471 --> 04:50.750
Where are you going?

04:50.751 --> 04:52.631
Something else to remember.

05:22.071 --> 05:23.430
Michael Ennis?

05:23.431 --> 05:24.710
Out here? Not sure.

05:24.711 --> 05:26.390
My name's John Newfield.

05:26.391 --> 05:28.870
I'm a probate officer
for the estate of Blake Gaines.

05:28.871 --> 05:29.990
The barrister?

05:29.991 --> 05:31.150
He died recently.

05:31.151 --> 05:32.870
I know, I saw him just before.

05:32.871 --> 05:34.750
We've been trying
to get in contact with you.

05:34.751 --> 05:35.830
Why?

05:35.831 --> 05:38.071
You've been named a beneficiary
of my client's estate.

05:38.751 --> 05:40.511
Blake Gaines?

05:41.031 --> 05:42.070
Are you kidding?

05:42.071 --> 05:43.110
Well, he left you this,

05:43.111 --> 05:46.470
with strict instructions
for it to be given to you in person.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.711
Is it a Porsche?

05:49.431 --> 05:51.191
Should I check for wires?

06:18.623 --> 06:20.063
So who the hell are you?

06:24.630 --> 06:29.389
Six years ago, we saw an opportunity
to create a mining business

06:29.390 --> 06:33.109
in the Sankele region of Eastern DRC.

06:33.110 --> 06:37.189
At that time, we also established
a charitable foundation,

06:37.190 --> 06:38.709
the Sankele Foundation,

06:38.710 --> 06:40.749
where we, Kromin,

06:40.750 --> 06:44.310
funded the construction of schools,
hospitals and a church.

06:45.550 --> 06:47.909
This is a responsible business enterprise

06:47.910 --> 06:51.709
helping to create and maintain
a place of stability,

06:51.710 --> 06:53.389
a place of opportunity,

06:53.390 --> 06:56.989
but most of all, a place of peace,

06:56.990 --> 07:01.389
for us, for the people
and for the region.

07:01.390 --> 07:03.230
I thank God for the opportunity.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.470
Smug little shit.

07:15.590 --> 07:17.789
"This went on bitterly."

07:17.790 --> 07:20.070
"He said I'd end up as a janitor
if I was lucky."

07:21.270 --> 07:23.870
"It's what fathers say to keep us safe."

07:24.496 --> 07:26.096
Mikey.

07:26.870 --> 07:28.829
Whatcha reading?

07:28.830 --> 07:31.109
The Forgiven

07:31.110 --> 07:33.630
by Lawrence Osborne, very good.

07:34.990 --> 07:36.185
What about?

07:36.910 --> 07:41.429
It's set in Morocco, bunch of white
people failing to understand

07:41.430 --> 07:43.189
the world in which they find themselves.

07:43.190 --> 07:45.696
My God, am I in it?

07:45.697 --> 07:46.990
Is that me?

07:51.829 --> 07:52.948
Y'ello?

07:52.949 --> 07:54.588
Michael Ennis.

07:54.589 --> 07:55.788
If you say so.

07:55.789 --> 07:58.388
I'm calling on behalf of Frank Munezero,

07:58.389 --> 08:01.348
the CEO of Premium Bank.

08:01.349 --> 08:02.749
Yeah.

08:03.909 --> 08:06.104
Frank is unable to travel at the moment,

08:06.669 --> 08:09.424
and all his calls are being monitored.

08:10.055 --> 08:12.935
However, before his arrest,
he employed me to do a job.

08:13.029 --> 08:14.148
Yeah.

08:14.149 --> 08:16.829
The job your daughter used to do...

08:17.769 --> 08:19.409
before her crash,

08:19.616 --> 08:20.896
just before.

08:21.789 --> 08:24.068
I have some information.

08:24.069 --> 08:25.588
What is it?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.428
Stay in London.

08:27.429 --> 08:29.028
I'll come to you.

08:29.029 --> 08:31.549
No! No, no, no, no, no!

09:26.189 --> 09:27.949
Mr Ennis.

09:29.629 --> 09:31.989
Come in. Come in, come in!

09:33.983 --> 09:35.747
I got to be honest,

09:35.748 --> 09:38.668
I only got my Math SAT
by underlining in red, so...

09:41.788 --> 09:43.547
I suppose what I do,

09:43.548 --> 09:45.227
what your daughter did,

09:45.228 --> 09:48.867
it's like a financial blood test,

09:48.868 --> 09:53.827
you have to use a microscope
to see what's really going on.

09:53.828 --> 09:55.159
And what have you seen?

09:55.160 --> 09:58.947
Our bank deals with Kromin,
the mining company.

09:58.948 --> 10:00.063
Yes?

10:01.303 --> 10:02.468
Here.

10:06.348 --> 10:09.983
In the scale of their transactions,
this is a trifle,

10:10.588 --> 10:13.828
but, nonetheless, it is for 23 million...

10:15.348 --> 10:18.227
per annum for the last six years,

10:18.228 --> 10:19.508
paid to a church.

10:20.508 --> 10:22.507
This church is very unusual.

10:22.508 --> 10:25.267
It only exists in two places.

10:25.268 --> 10:28.187
One, in the village of Sankele,
in the DRC,

10:28.188 --> 10:30.027
the Kromin village.

10:30.028 --> 10:32.446
And the other, here, in London.

10:32.447 --> 10:36.308
It is a very large amount to be
paying to a very small church.

10:37.943 --> 10:39.627
Now, the name of the church
is The Univers...

10:39.628 --> 10:42.387
Universal Church of Christ
the Peacemaker.

10:42.388 --> 10:44.387
Yes. How do you know?

10:44.388 --> 10:47.623
They've been paying for the defence
of Patrice Ganimana.

10:48.503 --> 10:50.308
It's a protection racket.

10:50.903 --> 10:52.468
The whole thing.

10:53.668 --> 10:56.547
They're paying Ganimana
through the church

10:56.548 --> 10:58.507
to keep the peace in the region.

10:58.508 --> 11:01.027
23 million stops him
stealing from the mine.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.987
It means that Kromin can guarantee
that they're conflict-free.

11:04.988 --> 11:06.667
They're paying him off!

11:06.668 --> 11:08.147
Him and his private army.

11:09.188 --> 11:11.823
Poacher turned gamekeeper.

11:12.428 --> 11:14.387
I bet they've become the police.

11:14.388 --> 11:16.786
That's more than I knew.

11:16.787 --> 11:18.466
What do you know?

11:18.467 --> 11:22.106
Only that the patron of this church
is a David Runihura,

11:22.107 --> 11:23.586
Special Advisor to the...

11:23.587 --> 11:24.626
To the President.

11:24.627 --> 11:25.706
Yes.

11:25.707 --> 11:29.946
But then you are saying
that a leading member of the RPF

11:29.947 --> 11:31.426
is secretly paying...

11:31.427 --> 11:33.746
Paying millions in protection

11:33.747 --> 11:37.587
to a man his government regard
as the very devil.

11:37.862 --> 11:42.186
In order to ensure that the supply
line through their country

11:42.187 --> 11:44.186
remains conflict-free.

11:44.187 --> 11:48.186
And very profitable,
for everyone involved.

11:48.187 --> 11:51.506
And this, I think,
is what your daughter found out.

11:51.507 --> 11:53.347
Just before her crash.

11:57.227 --> 11:58.667
Why didn't you say anything?

11:59.667 --> 12:01.426
There was no opportunity.

12:01.427 --> 12:02.547
Until now.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.266
One thing, though.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.386
I understand why Ganimana wants to
slough off his criminal past.

12:10.387 --> 12:13.747
That amount of money,
you'd need to travel to spend it.

12:14.262 --> 12:17.662
Why come here? To the UK?

12:18.702 --> 12:21.867
And one final thing we wanted to
show you is this...

12:23.427 --> 12:26.627
the man who stole the tape
from our vault...

12:27.182 --> 12:28.266
We don't know his name,

12:28.267 --> 12:32.782
but we do know he must have had
inside help, government help.

12:33.307 --> 12:34.947
So, whoever he is...

12:36.187 --> 12:38.267
he works for David Runihura.

13:55.426 --> 13:56.986
Your daughter...

13:58.186 --> 13:59.266
found this out?

14:06.266 --> 14:08.226
I'm so sorry, Michael.

14:08.701 --> 14:09.946
But?

14:10.986 --> 14:12.465
No buts.

14:12.466 --> 14:13.532
Clearly, this is something

14:13.557 --> 14:15.785
you're going to have to take
up directly with Kromin.

14:15.786 --> 14:18.106
- I will.
- You should.

14:19.266 --> 14:21.386
The police too, I dare say.

14:22.906 --> 14:24.941
But you'll want to be involved?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.181
Because?

14:27.746 --> 14:31.303
Lady Helen Uglow. Do you know her?

14:32.026 --> 14:33.221
Yes.

14:34.466 --> 14:35.701
As?

14:36.226 --> 14:37.465
She's an industrialist.

14:37.466 --> 14:38.826
On the board of Kromin.

14:40.105 --> 14:41.144
Is she now?

14:43.945 --> 14:45.873
That might put her in a bit of a spot.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.640
You too.

14:49.225 --> 14:51.460
She's also the wife
of the Attorney General.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.864
Little bit more than a spot,
wouldn't you say?

14:56.865 --> 14:59.385
More like a melanoma.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.167
I'm sure you'd want to have that cut out.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.424
I'm not really...

15:03.425 --> 15:07.185
Patrice Ganimana had a barrister,
name of Blake Gaines...

15:08.465 --> 15:11.104
Arrogant ass, God rest his soul.

15:11.105 --> 15:13.424
But, just before he died,

15:13.425 --> 15:18.060
he told me that Patrice Ganimana
will never, ever go to jail.

15:19.465 --> 15:20.585
You know what?

15:23.025 --> 15:24.785
I'm starting to think he's right.

15:26.105 --> 15:28.905
Already, they've ground down his
case at the ICC,

15:29.340 --> 15:31.704
and they're in the middle of doing
the exact same

15:31.705 --> 15:34.344
with his extradition to Rwanda.

15:34.345 --> 15:38.544
In the end, there's just one last
line the prosecution can take,

15:38.545 --> 15:40.185
universal jurisdiction.

15:41.225 --> 15:44.593
The CBS will want
to try and prosecute his case here.

15:44.594 --> 15:47.824
But they can only do that
with the explicit approval

15:47.825 --> 15:49.304
of the Attorney General.

15:49.305 --> 15:51.424
And Sir Nigel can refuse prosecution

15:51.425 --> 15:54.184
to any case he deems to be
not in the public interest.

15:54.185 --> 15:55.585
Are you with me so far?

15:56.825 --> 15:57.904
Riveted.

15:57.905 --> 16:01.504
So I wonder, Fred,
with Lady Uglow on the board,

16:01.505 --> 16:03.784
250 million passing through the books

16:03.785 --> 16:06.304
of this UK-based company,

16:06.305 --> 16:09.944
trade deals throughout the world
at a particularly delicate period,

16:09.945 --> 16:15.024
while at the same time promoting
stability, peace and wealth

16:15.025 --> 16:17.264
throughout
an otherwise tempestuous region,

16:17.265 --> 16:19.024
all this,

16:19.025 --> 16:20.185
all this...

16:21.185 --> 16:23.504
protected by one little man.

16:24.624 --> 16:26.343
A little African.

16:26.344 --> 16:28.213
With an argument between the two sides

16:28.238 --> 16:29.983
we never really understood anyway.

16:29.984 --> 16:34.703
I mean, the way this country sees
it, let's be honest,

16:34.704 --> 16:37.099
it's like President Mitterrand said,

16:37.784 --> 16:41.263
"Out there, killing each other,"

16:41.264 --> 16:43.424
"it's just what they do, isn't it?"

16:45.259 --> 16:47.383
So taking all that into consideration,

16:47.384 --> 16:52.183
I wonder, Fred, if, when presented
with just such a case,

16:52.184 --> 16:55.183
the Attorney General
might well indeed decide

16:55.184 --> 16:57.383
that the prosecution of Patrice Ganimana

16:57.384 --> 16:59.539
is not in the public interest.

17:00.504 --> 17:01.743
Don't get me wrong,

17:01.744 --> 17:03.583
that's not the reason they'll give.

17:03.584 --> 17:08.259
They'll find some flaw
in the legal process to pin it on.

17:09.184 --> 17:11.979
But however they do it,
in the eyes of the law,

17:12.464 --> 17:17.022
I am willing to place
a great big coltan mine-sized bet

17:17.023 --> 17:20.063
that Patrice Ganimana
will be winging his way

17:20.064 --> 17:24.624
straight back to where he came from,
totally and utterly scot-free.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.464
What do you wonder, Fred?

18:18.783 --> 18:19.938
Kate!

18:20.703 --> 18:21.743
Wait!

18:24.543 --> 18:26.182
What are you doing?

18:26.183 --> 18:27.303
The market.

18:29.343 --> 18:30.623
How long have you been here?

18:32.103 --> 18:34.498
Long enough to know
you've got to get there early.

18:35.303 --> 18:36.863
You should not be here.

18:39.783 --> 18:41.183
Where's Eunice?

18:47.823 --> 18:49.058
Why not?

18:49.583 --> 18:50.902
They took her visa.

18:50.903 --> 18:52.142
She's the Secretary of State!

18:52.143 --> 18:54.023
They took her job also.

18:58.383 --> 19:00.023
And they sent you instead?

19:01.223 --> 19:03.783
So who are you working for now,
"Floronze"?

19:11.916 --> 19:14.276
You were a child soldier.
I can't imagine.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.663
But don't ever become a mercenary.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.138
I'm not.

19:27.343 --> 19:28.383
Are you alone?

19:30.790 --> 19:31.830
Got her.

19:34.751 --> 19:36.311
Who is she?

19:36.336 --> 19:38.656
Looks like the only friend I've got.

19:41.037 --> 19:43.622
Kate, stop! Please!

19:43.623 --> 19:45.822
Is there something you need, Florence?

19:45.823 --> 19:47.382
For you to go home.

19:48.782 --> 19:53.301
You know, when I first got here,
I went to the UN,

19:53.302 --> 19:56.581
the local church, the police...

19:56.582 --> 19:58.541
Weirdly, they all said the same thing.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.337
Then you should listen.

20:06.702 --> 20:08.897
I thought you were working with me.

20:11.942 --> 20:13.102
I am.

20:14.662 --> 20:16.817
Then help me find those graves!

20:59.462 --> 21:00.777
Hello!

21:01.542 --> 21:03.342
It's me again.

21:08.062 --> 21:10.061
Maybe you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

21:10.062 --> 21:13.941
but I'm afraid that doesn't mean
I'm going to stop... saying it.

21:13.942 --> 21:18.221
I'm looking for the location
of a camp clearance, near here,

21:18.222 --> 21:20.422
involving 50,000 people.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.375
20 years ago?

21:25.302 --> 21:28.142
I realise you all may have been away
for the weekend...

21:30.341 --> 21:33.736
but if there is something,

21:34.181 --> 21:38.061
anything, that might twig your
memory, I'd just be so grateful.

22:26.486 --> 22:28.086
Ms Ashby...

22:30.421 --> 22:32.696
might you also sing for us?

22:34.261 --> 22:35.740
You know, I'm a bit confused.

22:35.741 --> 22:37.380
I think so.

22:37.381 --> 22:39.420
About you. About everyone, actually.

22:39.421 --> 22:42.500
It is understandable, you are a tourist.

22:42.501 --> 22:43.860
Who you all really work for.

22:43.861 --> 22:45.860
No confusion,

22:45.861 --> 22:47.861
I am here to keep the peace.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.600
But not to tell the truth.

22:54.661 --> 22:56.740
Between '96 and 2003,

22:56.741 --> 22:59.660
up to 6 million people
were killed in this country.

22:59.661 --> 23:01.060
You don't need to tell me.

23:01.061 --> 23:04.981
But obviously I do,
because that is the truth.

23:06.061 --> 23:08.020
And my job...

23:08.021 --> 23:11.019
is to ensure it never,

23:11.020 --> 23:14.539
ever... happens... again.

23:14.540 --> 23:17.099
"The past isn't dead,
it isn't even past."

23:17.100 --> 23:18.660
Do you know that one?

23:20.780 --> 23:24.339
But here, in this country, it has to be.

23:24.340 --> 23:27.660
So it doesn't infect the future.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.139
Too late!

23:30.900 --> 23:32.339
Her.

23:32.340 --> 23:33.579
Him. Him.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.260
Me. You.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.500
Everyone.

23:38.540 --> 23:40.500
We're infected already!

23:41.540 --> 23:45.179
And the only chance of a real cure,

23:45.180 --> 23:46.779
the only chance of a real future,

23:46.780 --> 23:48.499
a real escape from that past,

23:48.500 --> 23:50.939
secretly buried out there,

23:50.940 --> 23:53.180
is for everyone to recognise it.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.860
And now you are playing Hamlet.

24:03.220 --> 24:04.700
Bravo, mademoiselle.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.180
Kate, stop. Please!

24:27.380 --> 24:29.979
I thought you were working with me.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.339
I am.

24:31.340 --> 24:33.380
Then help me find those graves.

25:52.419 --> 25:55.339
Get... Get out!

25:59.619 --> 26:00.899
Get out!

26:27.659 --> 26:29.619
She will not go.

26:30.859 --> 26:33.739
- No.
- Then she must stay.

26:35.618 --> 26:37.738
You must make her.

26:40.418 --> 26:42.738
I will show you where.

27:09.698 --> 27:11.178
There.

27:22.258 --> 27:24.018
That mound.

27:24.624 --> 27:25.944
The mine.

27:28.178 --> 27:29.573
They dig here?

27:30.178 --> 27:31.818
But then they stopped.

27:33.498 --> 27:35.898
How many did they find?

27:36.418 --> 27:37.898
Enough.

27:40.317 --> 27:41.357
Were you here?

27:42.724 --> 27:43.764
Back then?

27:46.458 --> 27:50.578
Our village was Congolese, Tutsi.

27:51.053 --> 27:52.658
You attack them?

27:54.178 --> 27:56.618
They were genocidaires.

27:58.458 --> 27:59.777
Many were children.

27:59.778 --> 28:02.258
Genocidaires have family.

28:03.724 --> 28:04.924
Your family...

28:06.298 --> 28:07.938
were genocidaires.

28:19.537 --> 28:22.573
The Rwandan, Runihura,

28:22.574 --> 28:26.656
he told us you would do anything
to bury your past.

28:26.657 --> 28:27.777
That true?

28:37.257 --> 28:39.372
I hear you can use this?

28:53.217 --> 28:54.497
And the village?

28:55.250 --> 28:56.970
They already know.

28:58.217 --> 29:00.452
She should never have left.

30:15.096 --> 30:16.931
I've found them.

30:22.629 --> 30:23.829
Where?

30:24.456 --> 30:25.896
I will take you.

30:27.335 --> 30:28.535
Why?

30:30.536 --> 30:32.696
Cos you did not think I would.

31:47.338 --> 31:50.735
I was paid to bring you here.

31:53.895 --> 31:55.175
To dig this hole.

31:56.508 --> 31:57.588
Put you in it.

32:00.655 --> 32:02.295
I was paid to do this.

32:06.221 --> 32:08.258
But not with money.

32:31.722 --> 32:33.202
With this.

32:37.735 --> 32:39.055
A way home.

32:42.188 --> 32:43.708
Forgiven.

32:52.895 --> 32:58.055
But it turns out, it's not just
genocide deniers who are blind.

33:04.135 --> 33:06.975
And I must find my own way home.

33:18.375 --> 33:19.615
My name...

33:21.258 --> 33:24.654
is Florence Karamera.

33:27.094 --> 33:28.614
What is yours?

33:41.254 --> 33:43.294
My name is...

33:53.334 --> 33:56.337
My name is Kate Ashby.

33:59.894 --> 34:02.334
But you come from Sankele.

34:05.374 --> 34:06.814
I do.

34:13.056 --> 34:15.654
They have come for you.

36:10.013 --> 36:12.613
Hello, David. Got a minute?

36:34.933 --> 36:36.493
Who else knows?

36:37.773 --> 36:41.053
- Just the British.
- What do they want?

36:42.133 --> 36:43.173
A deal.

36:45.519 --> 36:47.399
Alice Munezero.

36:48.692 --> 36:51.932
- Released and returned to government.
- To do what?

36:53.412 --> 36:56.772
Make the constitutional changes
she's demanded.

36:58.332 --> 37:01.332
And then? They want me to step down.

37:02.332 --> 37:03.495
No!

37:04.092 --> 37:05.495
No.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.852
Back. To step back.

37:09.252 --> 37:11.971
To allow others to...

37:11.972 --> 37:13.331
Share.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.811
But only from within.

37:15.812 --> 37:19.211
You will still be President.
No-one will know.

37:19.212 --> 37:20.292
I will.

37:21.452 --> 37:25.491
I will know that the person I trusted
most in this world betrayed me.

37:25.492 --> 37:27.212
Betrayed us all.

37:29.892 --> 37:32.571
Whatever I did, I did...

37:32.572 --> 37:36.171
For what? Balance of payments,
import/export,

37:36.172 --> 37:39.291
trade deficit, producer prices,
broad money, what?

37:39.292 --> 37:41.628
You made a deal with the devil.
For what, David?!

37:41.629 --> 37:42.784
- For you.
- Me?

37:42.809 --> 37:44.575
Yes, for you!

37:44.892 --> 37:47.353
It was up there. They don't want this...

37:47.354 --> 37:49.371
IP, tech hubs, conference centres!

37:49.372 --> 37:52.611
Who cares what the mzungu wants?
We have reached all our goals.

37:52.612 --> 37:54.691
But how long before
they outstrip us again?

37:54.692 --> 37:56.091
7% growth.

37:56.092 --> 37:58.171
Poverty levels below 30!

37:58.172 --> 38:01.811
Two-thirds drop in child mortality.
Universal primary education.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.331
All of that, me! Me!

38:03.332 --> 38:05.891
And over 70% of us still in the fields.

38:05.892 --> 38:06.820
It is falling.

38:06.845 --> 38:08.251
For how long, with a rising population?

38:08.252 --> 38:10.211
- It is changing!
- It must!

38:10.212 --> 38:14.211
- It is!
- And it will with that!

38:14.212 --> 38:17.611
What is in the ground!
That is all they really want.

38:17.612 --> 38:19.731
And we should let them have it,
but on our terms.

38:19.732 --> 38:22.017
It was on our terms. I chose the terms!

38:22.042 --> 38:23.215
How could you?

38:23.732 --> 38:27.972
How...? How could any of us, when
40% of our budget comes from them?!

38:28.612 --> 38:32.610
And as long as it stays like that,
they control everything!

38:32.611 --> 38:34.034
We are not Singapore!

38:34.059 --> 38:36.235
- We could be!
- Not like this.

38:37.251 --> 38:40.610
And that is why I made a deal like that.

38:40.611 --> 38:43.546
- No.
- Real wealth, real growth,

38:43.571 --> 38:45.974
real stability, real peace.

38:46.851 --> 38:48.050
I keep the peace.

38:48.051 --> 38:51.330
And perhaps, Bibi, the longer you
are seen as the only person who can,

38:51.331 --> 38:54.371
the worse the chaos will be
the moment you depart.

39:11.731 --> 39:13.891
- You wanted this all along?
- No.

39:14.851 --> 39:16.371
No!

39:17.931 --> 39:22.411
But now that it is here, I think
it's a deal we can make. We have to.

39:23.651 --> 39:25.931
I can't. I won't.

39:26.374 --> 39:27.970
Then we'll be ruined.

39:27.971 --> 39:29.051
By you!

39:31.131 --> 39:32.531
Nyamoya? Was that you?

39:34.731 --> 39:35.771
And that lawyer?

39:38.051 --> 39:40.650
To protect you. What you stood for.

39:40.651 --> 39:43.451
- Stand!
- And I stood with you.

39:43.814 --> 39:45.131
Every step.

39:47.971 --> 39:49.411
And now look.

39:56.491 --> 39:57.851
David.

40:02.131 --> 40:03.251
Where would you go?

40:05.644 --> 40:06.684
Away.

40:08.124 --> 40:09.494
Where?

40:21.450 --> 40:22.570
I was thinking that...

40:23.770 --> 40:26.290
perhaps I might introduce myself...

40:28.736 --> 40:30.376
to our daughter.

40:39.890 --> 40:41.690
Her father is dead.

40:45.650 --> 40:46.970
Of course.

40:48.970 --> 40:50.570
Yes.

40:55.290 --> 40:58.530
Did Alice know?
That you'd made that deal?

40:58.994 --> 41:00.173
No.

41:00.530 --> 41:02.289
Did you conspire with her?

41:02.290 --> 41:04.049
No.

41:04.050 --> 41:05.650
- In anything?
- No.

41:09.970 --> 41:12.050
So it was you who poisoned her?

41:15.283 --> 41:16.523
Yes.

41:17.616 --> 41:19.216
My sister.

41:21.330 --> 41:22.890
Your cuckoo.

41:26.970 --> 41:29.450
You want me to forgive you?

41:35.836 --> 41:37.653
I know that whatever you do...

41:39.990 --> 41:41.950
you'd have done for your country.

41:43.283 --> 41:45.883
Will do for your country.

41:48.130 --> 41:50.090
There is nothing to forgive.

42:11.089 --> 42:12.332
Madame President.

42:33.729 --> 42:35.209
My friends...

42:37.409 --> 42:40.489
sometimes we get so deafened
by the past

42:40.772 --> 42:43.129
that we go blind to our future.

42:44.249 --> 42:45.968
As your President,

42:45.969 --> 42:48.412
it is my job to see the future.

42:49.569 --> 42:52.052
And, unfortunately, I have to tell,

42:52.609 --> 42:55.968
I am almost certain we are never
going to win the World Cup.

42:57.569 --> 42:59.768
But there are other things,

42:59.769 --> 43:01.968
important things,

43:01.969 --> 43:04.572
things that must be seen.

43:05.729 --> 43:08.609
And I need you to see them with me...

43:10.329 --> 43:12.089
right now.

43:43.368 --> 43:45.128
Thank you all for being here.

43:45.288 --> 43:48.087
Witnesses to my release,

43:48.088 --> 43:51.384
it feels that I am spending
a lot of time recently

43:51.409 --> 43:53.912
rejoicing in being set free.

43:55.688 --> 43:59.051
I bear no ill will
to those who saw me detained.

44:00.328 --> 44:04.887
My claims about our past
had to be investigated,

44:04.888 --> 44:08.034
their truth established, and those claims

44:08.035 --> 44:10.367
have been vindicated.

44:10.368 --> 44:14.647
I now rejoin government with a clear
and complete acknowledgement

44:14.648 --> 44:17.447
of our past, present and future,

44:17.448 --> 44:20.021
and of a President without
whom these freedoms

44:20.046 --> 44:21.632
could not have been granted.

44:23.568 --> 44:25.605
There will be times, in the days ahead,

44:25.630 --> 44:28.007
to assess the full
implications of all this,

44:28.008 --> 44:34.167
but I am confident
that acknowledging our whole past

44:34.168 --> 44:39.248
allows us to move forward together
stronger than before.

44:41.128 --> 44:42.368
There is much work to do.

44:43.568 --> 44:46.048
Hurt and divisions to be healed.

44:46.968 --> 44:48.488
Justice to pursue.

44:50.488 --> 44:56.687
Yet... I foresee only an ever
brighter future for our nation

44:56.688 --> 44:58.407
and all her children.

45:00.208 --> 45:04.008
Thank you again.
Thank you all, thank you.

45:35.207 --> 45:36.807
I'm sorry.

45:40.567 --> 45:42.927
I'm afraid there's nothing more
we can do for you.

46:39.647 --> 46:40.990
But it turns out

46:41.596 --> 46:45.326
it's not just genocide
deniers who are blind.

47:57.806 --> 47:59.406
You were right, darling.

48:01.359 --> 48:02.799
You were right.

48:06.872 --> 48:08.592
I'm Jewish. Did you know that?

48:09.806 --> 48:11.526
Er, no, I didn't.

48:13.665 --> 48:15.145
Jenny didn't tell you?

48:15.886 --> 48:18.686
Well, hadn't quite got round to it.

48:19.579 --> 48:24.289
Well... you know, not practising.

48:25.246 --> 48:28.166
- But you believe?
- I shout at him a bit.

48:29.486 --> 48:30.965
Well, there's a lot to shout about.

48:33.326 --> 48:34.765
See you tomorrow, Harper.

48:34.766 --> 48:36.886
Yeah. See you, Mikey.

48:41.472 --> 48:42.592
Harper?

48:47.805 --> 48:49.365
You'll know, Mikey.

48:50.525 --> 48:51.565
We all will.

48:52.845 --> 48:54.325
Everything is known.

48:55.325 --> 48:56.805
When the time's right.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.685
Where were we?

49:12.245 --> 49:14.825
"The light was brown with flying sand,"

49:14.850 --> 49:17.429
like the inside of an old fish tank.

49:18.685 --> 49:22.284
"The grit didn't seem to bother
the locals,"

49:22.285 --> 49:25.325
"who obviously came here
to network and trade."

50:17.885 --> 50:20.284
You can't swim?

50:20.285 --> 50:22.164
You know I can't.

50:22.165 --> 50:23.565
No, I did not.

50:25.165 --> 50:27.404
There's so much I don't know about you.

50:27.847 --> 50:29.964
Well, now you know that.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.683
Do you want to learn?

50:35.964 --> 50:37.124
It's never too late.

50:38.684 --> 50:39.763
You would teach me?

50:39.764 --> 50:42.924
Not in 15 minutes between appointments.

50:49.364 --> 50:51.323
You're not wearing that thing.

50:51.324 --> 50:52.604
No.

50:54.484 --> 50:57.484
Ooh! It's cold!

50:57.847 --> 50:59.723
You'll get used to it.

50:59.724 --> 51:01.444
I did.

51:26.284 --> 51:30.243
Then there is the World Bank
Conference in South Africa for March.

51:30.244 --> 51:33.243
With the President on leave, they've
invited you to give the key-note.

51:33.244 --> 51:35.043
On what, specifically?

51:35.044 --> 51:37.483
They expect you to give
a very positive assessment

51:37.484 --> 51:38.643
of our future growth.

51:38.644 --> 51:41.243
Try and stop me.

51:41.244 --> 51:42.923
Next?

51:42.924 --> 51:44.324
An update on Kromin.

51:45.684 --> 51:49.723
The attacks on their supply line
in the DRC are growing.

51:49.724 --> 51:51.483
If it continues on this scale,

51:51.484 --> 51:54.847
they'll no longer be able to claim
Dodd-Frank Certification.

51:55.764 --> 51:57.163
And this new group?

51:57.164 --> 51:58.443
A16s.

51:58.444 --> 52:00.963
Jihadis, down through Uganda.

52:00.964 --> 52:02.603
Pretty organised.

52:02.604 --> 52:03.684
It's a danger.

52:06.184 --> 52:08.344
Which they must contain, not us.

52:08.737 --> 52:10.416
But if they cannot?

52:16.643 --> 52:18.163
Sophie Barre.

52:18.486 --> 52:22.002
CEO of Barre Resources,
the daughter of Jacques...

52:22.003 --> 52:24.002
Jacques Antoine Barre.

52:24.003 --> 52:26.522
The man who led
the prosecution against you.

52:26.523 --> 52:31.082
Unsuccessfully, and whose daughter
helped us in its collapse.

52:31.083 --> 52:33.922
And who is now the sole owner

52:33.923 --> 52:37.403
of one of the largest mining
operations in Africa.

52:37.949 --> 52:39.429
She's French.

52:42.923 --> 52:45.721
It's just the Great Game all over.

52:45.722 --> 52:47.243
But this time...

52:48.803 --> 52:50.643
we will be the ones who win.

52:53.803 --> 52:56.203
Call Sophie Barre.

52:58.516 --> 52:59.916
Of course.

53:12.389 --> 53:13.869
Thank you.

53:16.523 --> 53:18.843
So, what's next?

53:20.963 --> 53:23.202
So there is the Opti interview,

53:23.203 --> 53:26.162
which is a radio interview
that you can do from home.

53:26.163 --> 53:28.123
We have the TVIS review...

54:34.162 --> 54:35.762
- Morning, Michael.
- Morning.

54:53.322 --> 54:55.482
- Morning, Michael.
- Morning.

55:23.762 --> 55:25.361
Y'ello?

55:25.362 --> 55:26.925
I knew you'd pick up.

55:28.602 --> 55:31.201
I don't know... This biking game?

55:31.202 --> 55:33.361
It's good for your heart.

55:33.362 --> 55:36.804
Actually, I put that down to a
particularly fine Saint-Emilion.

55:37.681 --> 55:38.721
Everything all right?

55:39.801 --> 55:40.921
It's a beautiful country.

55:41.961 --> 55:43.441
It's your home.

55:43.844 --> 55:46.361
Well, we'll see.

55:47.361 --> 55:50.564
You know, throughout everything,
you never actually came here.

55:51.321 --> 55:52.724
I was always there, Kate.

55:53.641 --> 55:55.241
Ever since I left.

55:59.001 --> 56:00.320
What are you on?

56:00.321 --> 56:01.361
Pills?

56:02.881 --> 56:04.084
I kicked those.

56:04.921 --> 56:06.680
Kind of miss them, though.

56:06.681 --> 56:09.800
Brief! Extradition case.

56:09.801 --> 56:12.000
They bringing the money with them?

56:12.001 --> 56:14.560
We call it the Ennis procedure.

56:14.561 --> 56:15.644
Yeah?

56:16.281 --> 56:18.521
My oncologist says the same!

56:18.884 --> 56:20.321
How's that?

56:20.804 --> 56:24.601
Tight as a bell,
if that's the proper expression.

56:26.681 --> 56:28.481
What are you working on?

56:29.961 --> 56:31.201
The usual.

56:32.401 --> 56:34.844
There is nothing usual about you,
Michael Ennis.

56:35.921 --> 56:37.484
Nor you, Kate Ashby.

56:41.001 --> 56:42.161
I'm sorry...

56:43.961 --> 56:46.001
I didn't tell you sooner.

56:47.641 --> 56:49.881
You didn't think I was ready.

56:51.801 --> 56:52.841
Were you?

56:54.961 --> 56:58.121
Well, here I am.

56:59.681 --> 57:01.880
I got one other thing to tell you.

57:01.881 --> 57:03.000
What?

57:03.001 --> 57:04.121
Your mother.

57:05.481 --> 57:07.281
Don't be too hard on her memory.

57:09.244 --> 57:12.244
She only ever wanted to give yours back.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.160
They're calling me.

57:21.440 --> 57:22.883
Sure.

57:24.440 --> 57:25.720
I should let you go.

57:28.880 --> 57:32.320
Kate...

58:04.400 --> 58:05.760
Yeah, well...

58:07.000 --> 58:08.280
I said it already.
