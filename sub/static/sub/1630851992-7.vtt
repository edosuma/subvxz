(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:30.030 --> 00:31.197
THANOS: The Tesseract.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.241
Or your brother's head.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.036
(SCREAMING)

00:39.205 --> 00:40.206
All right, stop!

00:42.250 --> 00:43.251
(THOR GASPING)

00:50.717 --> 00:52.927
THANOS: There are two more
stones on Earth.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.765
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.

00:57.932 --> 01:01.102
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.814
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.734
-(CROWD CLAMORING)
-Kneel!

01:07.817 --> 01:10.153
If you consider failure experience.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.490
-LOKI: I consider experience experience.
-(GRUNTS)

01:13.573 --> 01:14.908
Almighty Thanos...

01:15.617 --> 01:19.579
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

01:20.580 --> 01:21.581
Odinson...

01:22.207 --> 01:24.209
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

01:24.876 --> 01:26.628
god of mischief...

01:27.587 --> 01:29.255
do hereby pledge to you...

01:29.964 --> 01:33.426
my undying fidelity.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.227
LOKI: Your savior is here.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.104
ODIN: ...the Realm Eternal,

01:44.813 --> 01:46.314
Asgard.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.609
Though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,

01:50.110 --> 01:54.280
it was Asgard that brought peace
to the universe.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.158
-Only one of you can ascend to the throne.
-(ALL CHEERING)

01:57.242 --> 02:01.037
But both of you were born to be kings.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.040
-My friends.
-FANDRAL: Where's Odin?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.543
LOKI: Father has fallen
into the Odinsleep.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.670
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.714
Your king.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.927
I will conceal you,

02:16.010 --> 02:20.849
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.434
I accept.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.983
(GROANS)

02:32.610 --> 02:33.987
THOR: Why have you done this?

02:34.529 --> 02:36.990
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.869
When he wakes, I will have saved his life.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.954
Loki, this is madness.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.622
Is it madness?

02:44.706 --> 02:45.874
(BREATH TREMBLING)

02:45.957 --> 02:46.958
Is it?

02:48.585 --> 02:49.836
Is it?

02:50.795 --> 02:53.965
Come on, what happened to you on Earth
that turned you so soft?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.177
Don't tell me it was that woman!

02:58.511 --> 03:00.054
Oh!

03:00.138 --> 03:01.681
It was!

03:01.764 --> 03:05.768
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

03:05.852 --> 03:07.937
(BOTH SCREAMING)

03:17.447 --> 03:19.490
(PANTING)

03:25.830 --> 03:28.541
-I thought you dead.
-Did you mourn?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.335
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

03:30.418 --> 03:31.753
He has an army...

03:32.837 --> 03:35.715
LOKI: The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

03:35.798 --> 03:38.301
THOR: He means to lead them
against your people.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.886
They will win him the Earth.

03:40.803 --> 03:41.930
There is no stopping it.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.139
There is only

03:43.223 --> 03:44.682
the war.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.767
So be it.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.644

03:50.438 --> 03:51.981
(GRUNTS)

03:52.065 --> 03:53.274
Enough!

03:53.608 --> 03:55.735
I am a god, you dull creature.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.238
And I will not be bullied by...

04:00.698 --> 04:02.784
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:04.244 --> 04:05.536
Puny god.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.873
(WHIMPERING)

04:17.131 --> 04:19.467
ODIN: Wherever you go, there's war, ruin,

04:20.677 --> 04:22.011
-and death.
-(GROANS)

04:22.095 --> 04:26.140
All this because Loki desires a throne.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.811
You'll spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.314
LOKI: Did she suffer?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.900
I did not come here to share our grief.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.654
Instead, I offer you
the chance of a far richer sacrament.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.780
Vengeance.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.699
When do we start?

04:44.742 --> 04:46.286
Take us to your secret pathway.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.038
LOKI: Ta-da!

04:49.122 --> 04:51.165
THOR: I wish I could trust you.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.417
Trust my rage.

-(YELLS)

05:01.718 --> 05:03.261
Surprise.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.142
You'll be executed for this.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.394
Then I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.063
All right, I yield.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.356

-Where's Odin?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.529
HELA: My father is dead.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.575
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.536
THOR: Loki, I thought the world of you.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.289
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.208
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.503
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.757
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.387
Your savior is here.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.227
LOKI: This is madness.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.230
You want Asgard, it's yours.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.983
(ROARING)

05:59.067 --> 06:00.360
No.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.990
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.492
Maybe not.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.079
ASGARDIAN: We are under assault.

06:11.162 --> 06:15.625
Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.
We have very few soldiers here.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.585
EBONY MAW: You may think
this is suffering.

06:19.837 --> 06:20.922
No.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.549
It is salvation.

06:25.009 --> 06:30.223
Universal scales tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.731
-For even in death...
-(CHOKING)

06:38.815 --> 06:41.150
...you have become Children of Thanos.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.326
No resurrections this time.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.834
No. Loki.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.128
(THOR COUGHS)

07:00.211 --> 07:01.462
LOKI: I assure you, brother...

07:01.546 --> 07:04.048
the sun will shine on us again.
