00:45.600 --> 00:48.126
Time to smurf some magic.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.569
Let's see.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.250
There you are.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.163
Mimosa pollen.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.250
Yes, tiger lily

01:02.320 --> 01:05.642
to make her essence magical and blue.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.321
Unless this spell be all for naught,

01:10.400 --> 01:13.324
the final thing, one hopeful thought.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.442
Once upon a time, in Smurf Village,

01:28.520 --> 01:32.445
happy Smurfs
were going about their happy lives

01:32.520 --> 01:36.605
completely unaware that not too far away,

01:36.680 --> 01:39.763
the evil wizard Gargamel

01:39.840 --> 01:43.526
was concocting a diabolical plan.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.520
Hey-

01:45.600 --> 01:46.965
Hey!

01:47.040 --> 01:50.010
Smooth, you're upstaging the narrator.

01:50.080 --> 01:53.289
Yo, take it down a notch,
my blues brothers.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.362
- All right. All right.
- Thank you. Anyway...

01:55.520 --> 01:56.885
So Gargamel said,

01:57.040 --> 02:00.647
"I am making my own irresistible creation,"

02:00.720 --> 02:06.204
"the Smurfette, to infiltrate their village
and betray the Smurfs."

02:21.760 --> 02:22.807
Wow.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.325
Not a good look on her.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.970
- She's a Frankensmurf?
- Yes.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.248
And her naughty nature
took Smurf Village by storm.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.606
She even flooded our village.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.080
The Smurfs wanted her gone,

02:41.160 --> 02:46.246
but even though she was Gargamel's
creation, Papa saw the good in her.

02:46.320 --> 02:51.531
With love, kindness, a complete makeover,
and a secret magic formula,

02:51.600 --> 02:54.843
he turned her into a true-blue Smurf,

02:54.920 --> 02:59.608
and that is how
our darling Smurfette came to be.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.761
- Hi.
- Holy moly.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.285
Hi, Smurfette.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.609
I wish I had that hair.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.686
- Nice dive, Smurfette.
- That was amazing.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.727
Wow. Show-off.

03:16.840 --> 03:17.887
Pretty!

03:17.960 --> 03:21.282
- That was so purty.
- Nice tuck and roll.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.089
- Hi!
- Like a beautiful mermaid.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.925
Wait, how is her hair still dry?

03:29.440 --> 03:31.363
Oh, no.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.005
What...

03:34.960 --> 03:38.123
Stupid, trusting Smurfs.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.009
You're mine now.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.003
- It's alive!
- Smurf for the hills!

03:42.080 --> 03:43.844
Don't kill the narrator!

03:44.560 --> 03:47.962
The world as we know it is over!

03:48.440 --> 03:50.044
She's got a Dragon Wand.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.770
Don't hurt my cupcake!

03:51.840 --> 03:52.841
Look out!

03:56.240 --> 03:59.767
Yes! My beautiful creation.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.128
You truly are daddy's little girl.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.090
No...

04:15.240 --> 04:17.846
Smurfette, are you okay?

04:18.839 --> 04:20.204
Oh, Papa.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.441
There, there. Everything's
going to be fine.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.522
Having that nightmare again?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.765
Papa, every year on my birthday,

04:29.840 --> 04:32.844
I have these horrible dreams
about where I come from,

04:32.920 --> 04:37.528
and it makes me wonder who I really am.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.766
And every year, I remind you,
it doesn't matter where you came from.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.684
What matters is who you choose to be.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.524
Really?

04:48.640 --> 04:51.166
Don't take this old Smurf's word for it.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.720
Go out there and see for yourself.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.121
This is where you belong.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.806
<i>You belong to Gargamel.</i>

04:59.800 --> 05:02.406
<i>You belong to Gargamel.</i>

05:03.040 --> 05:06.089
"You belong to Gargamel." Say it.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.764
"You belong to Gargamel."

05:08.840 --> 05:11.241
“I, I.”

05:11.400 --> 05:14.324
You know what? Never mind, sir.
You're a dim-witted toad.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.251
"You're a dim-witted toad, sir?"

05:17.400 --> 05:19.402
No, actually, you are!

05:22.360 --> 05:23.885
There.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.206
<i>Yet another groundbreaking feat of illusion</i>

05:27.280 --> 05:31.205
<i>from the most innovative conjurer
the world has ever seen.</i>

05:31.760 --> 05:32.727
Gargamania,

05:32.800 --> 05:37.169
the magical sensation that has captivated
the nation from New York to Las Vegas,

05:37.240 --> 05:40.244
is now taking on the City of Light,
Paris, France.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.161
This master mysterio
has gone from unknown to unstoppable

05:44.280 --> 05:46.601
after a surprise discovery in New York.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.362
Yo, get out of the road, freak!

05:53.440 --> 05:56.967
How dare you? How dare you call me "Yo"?

05:57.040 --> 06:00.123
Hey, no, put my car down.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.965
Yo, how do you like it up there?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.406
Moron.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.241
<i>From New York street performer
to the new toast of Europe,</i>

06:16.320 --> 06:20.120
<i>the only magician ever to play
the famed Paris Opera House.</i>

06:20.200 --> 06:21.406
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

06:24.080 --> 06:27.562
Oh, dear gods, can we please
just have one quiet carriage ride

06:27.640 --> 06:30.644
without you tormenting me about
using up all the Smurf essence?

06:30.800 --> 06:35.089
I extracted all I could from Papa Smurf
in the kingdom of New York.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.889
How much essence did you extract?

06:38.480 --> 06:39.481
I'm squandering it?

06:39.640 --> 06:40.641
What are you talking about?

06:40.720 --> 06:44.167
I had to turn that man into a giant toad.
It's a magic show, isn't it?

06:45.640 --> 06:47.608
Because without Smurf essence, I can't...

06:47.680 --> 06:50.490
Why am I even discussing this with you?
You don't have any magic!

06:51.480 --> 06:53.847
Stick that on your
Facebook page and lick it.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.490
Like it. Like it. Whatever.

06:56.840 --> 06:57.966
Besides,

06:58.120 --> 07:02.489
I still have plenty enough essence left to
carry out my delightfully diabolical plan.

07:03.760 --> 07:06.730
Now, my adoring public desires me.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.650
Hello!

07:08.720 --> 07:11.929
Hello, my lowly little bootlicks.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.211
Yes, you must all worship me.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.281
Yes.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.364
Even you, my flea-bitten little fur bag.

07:20.800 --> 07:25.089
All hail the great and powerful...

07:25.240 --> 07:28.130
Azrael... Azrael... Stop it.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.210
Open it! Open it!

07:33.360 --> 07:35.761
Come, Azrael. Hurry up.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.729
Hello, handsome.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.565
Look, a present.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.961
No doubt from a worshipping admirer.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.161
It's for you.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.811
You are not more popular than I am.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.325
A little green dot?

08:04.480 --> 08:07.689
Why do you get all the little green dots?

08:07.880 --> 08:09.530
Get it, get it.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.006
Father's going to love this.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.081
- Hackus want to play.
- Hey!

08:12.160 --> 08:13.400
Let Hackus play with the kitty.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.760
Cover me.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.881
I'm going in.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.401
Hello, kitty.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.765
Vexy!

08:20.920 --> 08:22.604
All right, my little Naughties.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.041
Yeah!

08:25.480 --> 08:27.084
Hackus to the rescue!

08:28.240 --> 08:29.526
Booyah!

08:29.680 --> 08:31.648
Good save, Hackus.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.841
Pull, pull!

08:32.919 --> 08:35.764
Hackus cat-fishing. Caught a big one.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.923
And round 12 goes to the Naughties.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.082
Well said, my dim brother.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.447
Apparently, it wasn't a gift, Azrael.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.965
It was a trap.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.646
- Very amusing, my little Naughties.
- Hey!

08:50.720 --> 08:51.926
Did we please you, Father?

08:52.080 --> 08:54.003
No, no, you didn't.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.887
You know what would please me, Vexy,
if you were blue like real Smurfs,

08:59.040 --> 09:02.362
then your essence would endow me with real
magic like that of a true-blue Smurf.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.370
That would excite me.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.245
Instead, you're both just
deeply disappointing experiments.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.566
Experiment?

09:09.640 --> 09:12.644
Like my traitorous Smurfette.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.845
The banner goes over there, please.
Thank you, and I love the piñata.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.241
- How's that, Gutsy?
- A little lower, Grouchy.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.971
I want to be able to
whack him right in the smurf berries.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.003
Hey, Grouchy. Hey, Gutsy.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.243
What a cake!
Smurfette's gonna love this party!

09:27.320 --> 09:29.971
Hey, who smurfed a bite
out of Smurfette's birthday cake?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.041
- Not me.
- I don't know.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.168
- Greedy?
- What? Why you all looking at me?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.403
Hey, Brainy, here's my present
for Smurfette's surprise party.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.041
Come on, Jokey, do you really think that I,
the smartest Smurf in the village,

09:40.120 --> 09:42.009
- would fall for your sophomoric gag?
- Yep.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.844
Just give me the card.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.088
Out-smurfed by a simpleton.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.164
- She's coming. Smurfette's coming.
- Oh, no! The surprise will be ruined.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.290
Code blue! Code blue!
Repeat, this is not a drill. Code blue.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.441
Undo it, unglue it!

09:55.520 --> 09:56.851
We gotta get her out of here!

09:56.920 --> 09:59.048
Here she is! Act natural!

09:59.240 --> 10:00.526
Hey, guys.

10:00.680 --> 10:04.207
Anyone want to do anything fun
on this special day?

10:04.320 --> 10:06.209
Hey, Vanity.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.601
Want to sit by the fountain
and look at your reflection?

10:08.680 --> 10:11.650
Kind of tired of looking
at myself, Smurfette.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.960
As if.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.963
Nope, not building anything for anybody.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.041
- Hey, Party Planner.
- Hey.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.963
- Hey, Social Smurf.
- Yes, darling?

10:18.040 --> 10:21.123
Anything fun coming up
that I should know about?

10:21.200 --> 10:23.441
No, nothing till Smurfapalooza.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.881
It's going to be wild, right, Social Smurf?

10:25.960 --> 10:30.648
Yeah. I've got it all over the Smurf Web.
It's got 101 likes on Smurf book.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.085
I will put you on the guest list.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.323
So, no one remembered my birthday?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.408
The surprise is gonna be ruined!

10:37.560 --> 10:39.449
Hush up! Hush up!

10:41.240 --> 10:46.326
You know, Smurfette, occasionally,
it's good to have a little alone time.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.802
- Yeah, so take a hike.
- Yeah, we don't need you here, we're good.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.927
- Bye.
- There you go.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.490
See you.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.450
We fooled her pretty good,
don't you think, Clueless Smurf?

10:55.520 --> 11:00.162
Yeah!
She's got no idea about the surprise party!

11:01.520 --> 11:02.567
Dude.

11:05.920 --> 11:09.766
Maybe I really don't belong here.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.129
Okay, blow out the candles, Blue.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.762
Nice.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.331
Okay, I think
I've got everyone's issues covered here.

11:32.400 --> 11:37.122
This is an organic, gluten-free,
antioxidant-rich acai berry cake

11:37.280 --> 11:43.049
made locally by a cruelty-free baker
who swears he's never even seen a peanut.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.770
Everybody good? Right?

11:44.840 --> 11:47.650
- Are these plates PCB-free?
- No.

11:47.720 --> 11:52.044
- Actually, we're good.
- Actually, we're good. PCB and BPA-free.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.326
Daddy, can we cut the cake?

11:53.520 --> 11:54.521
- Yeah.
- All right, let's do that.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.761
Cut it.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.047
Boy, who thought parenting
could be so complicated?

11:58.120 --> 11:59.406
- Yummy.
- Seriously, guys?

11:59.480 --> 12:00.561
You guys make it look easy.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.563
Yeah, you must have had a great role model.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.687
No, not really.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.566
- My dad took off when I was five, so...
- Am I late?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.641
Did I miss all the presents?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.565
Hey!

12:12.720 --> 12:16.361
- Grandpa Vicster!
- Hey!

12:17.400 --> 12:18.447
Happy birthday, Blue.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.807
Now it's a party. Hello.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.291
I'm Victor, Patrick's dad.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.882
And you must all be his friends,
which makes you my friends.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.961
So let's go.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.760
Arms in the air, you're all getting hugs.

12:28.880 --> 12:29.927
Hey, okay.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.526
I thought you said your father left you.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.808
He did. This is my stepfather.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.484
You'll want him to leave. Just wait.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.523
Hello. Where's my Gracie?

12:38.680 --> 12:40.523
- Hey.
- Victor.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.045
How are you?

12:42.120 --> 12:43.281
You know, ever since Blue was born,

12:43.360 --> 12:46.921
I kind of miss you being as big as a house
with more of you to hug.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.047
Yep.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.686
And now, I've saved the
biggest hug for last.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.002
- Boundaries, please. Boundaries.
- Let's show them how it's done.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.605
Unhand me.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.280
I don't like this at all.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.006
Thank you.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.847
There's nothing like
the embrace of two proud Doyle men.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.206
I am not a Doyle man.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.361
Little Paddy Doyle.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.841
- Winslow.
- Okay, compromise. Winslow.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.729
Hyphen-Doyle.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.571
Hey, isn't he the guy
from the Korndog commercials on TV?

13:13.640 --> 13:15.722
- Hey, you're right.
- Well, you got me.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.120
- Korndog King.
- No, no, no.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.167
- One moment.
- Please not this.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.720
Now, in honour of Blue's birthday,

13:20.920 --> 13:23.641
I'm going to present each and every
one of you with a free Korndog...

13:24.040 --> 13:25.200
- Thank you.
- ...on the house.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.049
Teriaki dog.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.526
That's for you.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.364
Do these have any peanuts?

13:30.520 --> 13:33.046
I would never put peanuts in a Korndog.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.201
Great.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.691
Go ahead, big guy, it's okay.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.684
For the simple reason, you see,
we deep-fry them in peanut oil.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.801
Peanut oil?

13:39.920 --> 13:42.605
- What?
- Johnny, spit it... Spit it out right away!

13:42.800 --> 13:44.245
Okay, I got the phone, okay.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.768
Spit it out, Johnny! Spit it out right away!
Into Mama's hands.

13:47.880 --> 13:48.961
Deep breath for the EpiPen.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.242
- It's okay.
- What's happening to that kid's lips?

13:55.600 --> 13:58.046
- Azrael, bring me my plan.
- Father?

13:58.120 --> 14:00.168
It's in the bathroom.
Check my side of the sink.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.241
Father?

14:01.440 --> 14:02.965
It's feeding time.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.849
Hackus dizzy.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.002
Yes, I almost forgot.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.447
Apparently, I have to keep you alive.

14:09.520 --> 14:13.844
I hope you both appreciate
what a tremendous burden this is upon me.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.160
All right, mind your manners.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.560
Thank you.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.884
If you were real Smurfs,
I'd be taking essence from you.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.531
I didn't hear a "thank you."

14:24.680 --> 14:26.330
Close enough. Come, come.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.644
We must review my plan
before tonight's raid on Smurf Village.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.769
This is not my writing parchment.
Where is my plan?

14:36.680 --> 14:37.761
"Gone digital"?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.968
I don't understand what that means.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.487
Yes, phase one, "Create Naughties." Yes.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.642
Check. Where is phase two?

14:50.000 --> 14:51.968
I am enamoured of that swiping motion.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.731
Yes, get away, get away,
get away, get away.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.770
Phase three... Swipe.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.729
I capture my ungrateful daughter

14:59.800 --> 15:04.044
and force her to tell me the secret formula
that Papa used to turn her blue.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.201
Swipe.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.408
I turn you and hundreds
other like you blue.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.484
Hackus blue!

15:10.680 --> 15:14.401
I place you into a terrifying machine
and extract your essence.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.567
- What?
- And then,

15:15.680 --> 15:19.651
the entire world shall bow before me!

15:21.040 --> 15:23.646
Will that extracting thing hurt?

15:23.800 --> 15:26.326
It's excruciatingly painless.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.528
You'll see, it'll be fun, for me.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.640
Anyway, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

15:30.680 --> 15:36.130
Back to phase two, the very reason
we came to this cheese-infested metropolis.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.602
The great iron spire.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.284
The only possible way

15:41.360 --> 15:45.888
to harness enough energy to create a portal
right into the heart of Smurf Village.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.611
How I love portal creation.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.809
Come, come, let us away! To the iron spire!

16:33.880 --> 16:35.962
It worked!

16:36.160 --> 16:38.606
Yes! Just enough essence!

16:47.080 --> 16:50.687
And now I will go down in history!

16:50.760 --> 16:53.650
Nothing can stop me now!

16:58.360 --> 17:00.442
My Gargaberries!

17:02.800 --> 17:03.801
Oh, no!

17:06.359 --> 17:09.170
Now I shall prove my genius!

17:12.040 --> 17:14.247
Head spin!

17:19.079 --> 17:24.290
It appears I lack sufficient essence
to create a human-size portal.

17:24.359 --> 17:27.603
Father, I can fit through there.
Let me get Smurfette.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.727
Hackus go! Hackus go!

17:28.800 --> 17:30.211
- Hey!
- Hackus go!

17:30.280 --> 17:33.284
Yes, yes. Well, let's see here.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.049
- Eeny, meeny, miny...
- Pick me! Pick me!

17:37.160 --> 17:38.207
Moron.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.247
Yes!

17:39.320 --> 17:42.369
- Hey, Hackus, listen to this.
- What?

17:42.440 --> 17:43.646
I win.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.410
Nicely played, Vexy.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.084
Now, I must warn you.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.731
Your destination is a true horror.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.328
A realm filled with
the relentless crushing quiet of peace,

17:54.400 --> 17:57.609
punctuated by
the wretched cacophony of joyousness.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.449
- It's horrible.
- What a nightmare.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.921
Yes, yes, it completely ruined your sister.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.287
It's such a shame when
a bad girl turns good.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.361
So true.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.007
But she does know the secret formula,

18:09.160 --> 18:12.369
so go get Smurfette!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.082
I just don't get it.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.329
They know how tough my birthday can be,

18:22.440 --> 18:25.284
and they didn't even remember.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.206
Maybe Papa was wrong.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.204
Guess I'll never really be one of them.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.728
- Oh, no!
- Help.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.451
Please, wait.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.051
I escaped.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.366
Escaped?

18:45.960 --> 18:48.930
From the evil wizard who made me.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.124
Do you mean Gargamel?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.806
Is Gargamel your father?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.370
Yes.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.046
But he's...

18:59.120 --> 19:01.930
That means you're just like me.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.202
- Gotcha!
- What are you doing?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.248
Father's going to be very happy.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.005
Smurfette's in trouble!

19:08.080 --> 19:09.206
- Crikey!
- Oh, no!

19:09.280 --> 19:11.328
- Come on, Smurfs!
- Smurfette!

19:11.400 --> 19:13.004
No!

19:14.080 --> 19:15.844
- Oh, no, you don't.
- No!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.411
- Let go!
- Now get in there!

19:17.480 --> 19:19.050
Oh, no!

19:19.120 --> 19:22.249
- She's being smurf napped.
- Unhand her!

19:22.400 --> 19:25.051
So long, Smurfs.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.164
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

19:27.240 --> 19:28.366
What are we gonna do now?

19:28.440 --> 19:33.287
My powers of deduction lead me to believe
that this is the work of Gargamel.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.441
Oh, no, oh, no!

19:40.880 --> 19:43.087
- Yes!
- Pretty blue.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.525
Gargamel.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.729
Smurfette. Welcome home.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.527
You're wasting your time, Gargamel.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.329
Papa and the others are gonna come for me.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.244
I don't think so.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.890
They came for Clumsy.

20:03.960 --> 20:09.649
Yes, but you see, Clumsy was a real Smurf.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.930
Whereas I was the one who created you.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.562
You do remember that, don't you, dear?

20:17.360 --> 20:21.490
You're not my father. Just let me go home.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.891
Of course.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.291
Anything you say,

20:24.360 --> 20:30.402
but first, I will need one itsy-bitsy,
teeny-tiny little thing first.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.528
- Teeny-tiny.
- What?

20:33.160 --> 20:38.564
Just the secret formula that Papa
used to turn you into a real Smurf.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.405
Hackus real Smurf. Hackus blue!

20:41.480 --> 20:42.720
Like you, blondie.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.247
It would benefit us both,
don't you see, my dear?

20:45.320 --> 20:48.529
You give me the formula,
I turn my little Naughties blue.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.410
- Blue.
- I use their essence

20:50.480 --> 20:53.643
to continue with
my wonderful magic show here.

20:53.720 --> 20:58.248
That way I never have to bother you
or Smurf Village again.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.370
I don't trust you,
and I'm not telling you anything.

21:01.520 --> 21:06.003
Well,
perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?

21:07.080 --> 21:08.366
Naughties, attack!

21:08.520 --> 21:10.409
With pleasure.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.527
Attack!

21:11.680 --> 21:13.569
- No, no, no, not each other.
- Not me!

21:13.720 --> 21:15.609
I got you...

21:15.720 --> 21:16.960
Hackus!

21:17.120 --> 21:18.645
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.761
Not the cat, not the...

21:22.840 --> 21:25.764
Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.490
We've got to rescue Smurfette.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.085
What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?

21:29.160 --> 21:30.650
All right, Smurfs, listen up.

21:30.720 --> 21:35.487
I saved enough grotto water from the last
blue moon for just such an occasion.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.882
I was able to
smurf it into smurfportation crystals.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.049
So you don't need a portal.
Very clever, Papa.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.440
Smurf-xactly.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.524
These will take us directly to
Master Winslow's mushroom.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.849
Yeah, Patrick and Grace helped us
last time we smurfed through the portal.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.809
Precisely! They'll know what to do!

21:51.920 --> 21:52.960
- Sign me up!
- Sign me up.

21:53.040 --> 21:53.962
- At your service, Papa.
- Pick me!

21:54.080 --> 21:55.650
- Did someone say, "Baker should go"?
- I would rather not.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.721
Me, me, pick me, Papa!

21:56.800 --> 22:00.202
Now, now, Smurfs.
I only had water enough for nine crystals.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.569
That's me and three others round trip,
plus Smurfette on the way home.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.728
Assuming you can find her, which you won't.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.407
That's not a very smurfy attitude, Grouchy.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.608
Actually, for me, that was pretty good.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.764
I'll need courage,
intelligence and strength.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.126
- So Gutsy.
- Aye.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.326
- Brainy.
- Of course.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.566
- Hefty.
- You got it.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.524
- You'll smurf with me.
- Yeah, can I...

22:21.600 --> 22:23.841
Yes, Passive-Aggressive Smurf?

22:23.920 --> 22:27.766
I think Brainy is a
really excellent choice.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.841
Good luck with that.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.240
You see what he does?

22:30.320 --> 22:32.209
- That's not a compliment.
- Go figure.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.601
- Okay, Hefty, take one.
- Let's do this.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.768
- Go her, guys!
- Oops!

22:36.840 --> 22:37.841
Clumsy.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.200
Somebody do something!

22:39.360 --> 22:41.522
Stand back! I know the Smurflich manoeuvre.

22:41.880 --> 22:42.881
He doesn't look good.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.883
Oh, dear, he's turning blue-er.

22:44.960 --> 22:45.961
Not good.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.923
Somebody get my hammer!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.889
Nice going, Clumsy.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.247
I got it!

22:54.320 --> 22:55.890
Cheerio!

22:56.040 --> 22:58.202
This was supposed to be Hefty!

22:58.280 --> 22:59.725
Sorry! My bad!

22:59.800 --> 23:02.326
I get so puffy when I travel.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.441
Bye.

23:03.600 --> 23:07.286
Well, sometimes,
you got to smurf with the changes.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.441
Travel safe, Papa.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.245
<i>And so Papa and his B team...</i>

23:11.320 --> 23:12.765
I'll be in charge while you're gone!

23:12.840 --> 23:15.081
<i>- And</i> so Papa...
- Go get Smurfette back!

23:15.160 --> 23:17.891
- Come on!
- And bring her home!

23:20.240 --> 23:24.006
I'm glad his throat opened up
and his lips are back to normal.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.844
Again, we're so sorry.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.002
If... Hello?

23:29.400 --> 23:33.883
Johnny can breathe again, which makes two of
us since both of his parents are lawyers.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.850
Well, that's why they overreacted.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.126
They didn't overreact.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.964
He's dying.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.123
I think it's time for this.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.443
You didn't bring the crown.
Don't put the crown on him.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.010
Come on, you used to love this crown.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.491
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.244
- You wore it everywhere.
- I did not.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.407
Never did. Never once.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.604
This is the way you do it... Look.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.962
Do you see what is going on out there?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.803
Yeah, they're bonding.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.124
- Technically, they're spitting.
- Come on.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.601
Blue needs to know that
family's not just you and me,

24:08.680 --> 24:10.603
and it's really good for him
to play with his grandfather.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.205
Good job!

24:12.360 --> 24:15.011
- Oh, yeah. He's a terrific role model.
- Come on, Patrick.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.525
Grace, he ruins everything.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.281
He shows up, and he ruins things.
That's what he does.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.645
Just like when he first
moved into my house.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.927
He sent my parrot away.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.001
Your parrot?

24:27.160 --> 24:29.162
My father's parrot.

24:30.080 --> 24:35.928
When my dad took off, he left Zeus,
and I loved that bird.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.848
I was a kid, and Zeus
was the only part of my dad I had left.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.091
There you go.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.487
What?

24:58.360 --> 25:00.124
Get Blue. Blue?

25:01.320 --> 25:02.810
Blue?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.251
Blue! Victor!

25:18.760 --> 25:20.361
- Stay there.
- Victor, do you have Blue?

25:20.400 --> 25:21.561
Victor! We can't get the door open!

25:21.760 --> 25:23.046
Victor!

25:23.200 --> 25:25.601
- Victor, open the door!
- Victor, we can't open the door!

25:31.600 --> 25:33.602
I can't see! I can't see!

25:33.800 --> 25:37.486
I'm on a dark, lifeless planet
that smells like corn dogs!

25:39.120 --> 25:40.531
Oh, the smurfanity.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.281
Sorry, mister. Your face got in the way.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.964
- Is that Clumsy? Smurfs?
- Clumsy?

25:52.120 --> 25:53.724
- Help!
- Look out, Grouchy!

25:53.800 --> 25:55.450
- Clumsy, is that you?
- This way!

25:55.640 --> 25:57.961
- I'm blind!
- No, you're in a corn dog.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.320
I knew it would end this way!

26:03.400 --> 26:04.606
Where am I?

26:04.800 --> 26:07.644
This place is strange and terrifying

26:07.800 --> 26:10.167
and so handsome.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.009
Hello, you.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.161
No! '

26:15.640 --> 26:17.483
We're lost in the dark,
and it smells like corn dogs!

26:17.680 --> 26:18.681
Watch out!

26:19.840 --> 26:21.444
Master Winslow's gotten old.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.250
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Blue?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.448
Stop, stop, stop. They're friends.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.641
- Friends?
- Yeah.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.800
They're little blue aliens
trying to steal our faces.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.490
No, no, they're called Smurfs.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.803
And they are the sweetest little things
you ever did see.

26:33.880 --> 26:34.881
Not me.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.008
No, not you, Grouchy.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.241
Papa, Clumsy.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.811
- Patrick!
- Master Winslow.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.360
- Hi, Grace.
- Smurf, Smurf, Smurf!

26:42.520 --> 26:45.126
- Is that Blue?
- He's huge.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.687
I wouldn't want to be
the stork that brought that guy.

26:48.480 --> 26:53.520
Well, if Blue likes the Smurfs,
then Vicster likes the Smurfs.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.650
What a thrill this must be for all of you.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.489
No pictures, please.

26:58.560 --> 26:59.561
That's Vanity.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.171
Narcissist.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.321
What are you guys doing here?

27:02.440 --> 27:03.851
Smurfette's been taken.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.240
- Wait, what?
- Taken? What do you mean "taken"?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.727
Smurf napped by that ghastly Gargamel.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.610
She was off alone
because she thought we forgot her birthday.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.121
There was a misunderstanding.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.851
But if we can find him, we'll find her.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.888
Well, that shouldn't be hard.
He's a big star now.

27:18.040 --> 27:19.883
- He's in Paris.
- I'll call the dog sitter.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.246
You get Blue's passport.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.483
Yes, a rescue mission. I'll come, too.

27:24.680 --> 27:25.727
You need all the help you can get.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.604
Wait a minute, Blue's passport?

27:27.800 --> 27:29.450
We can't just up and go to Paris.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.967
At least, not all of us.

27:32.120 --> 27:36.603
Okay, so that's one vote no. Who votes yes?

27:38.600 --> 27:39.886
- Me.
- Of course.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.322
Daddy always loses.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.404
Look, this is my Smurfette
we're talking about. We have to go.

27:46.880 --> 27:50.680
If we're going to be travelling,
let's make sure we do this properly.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.965
Okay, here we are. Victor,
can you get Blue?

28:19.840 --> 28:21.285
- All right. We're all clear on the plan, right?
- Yeah.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.441
We'll head over to Gargamel's show

28:22.520 --> 28:24.124
- and see if Smurfette's there.
- Yes.

28:24.280 --> 28:27.124
And I'll go to Gargamel's hotel and see
if I can find out what room he's in.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.680
And, Victor, you and Blue
can just check into the room here.

28:29.760 --> 28:33.082
- Well, actually, I was thinking...
- No. "Actually, I" nothing.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.281
You and Blue, upstairs.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.680
That's the deal. End of story.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.010
<i>L'Opera House, s'il vous plaft.</i>

28:41.040 --> 28:42.690
My French is <i>trés</i> sexy, non?

28:42.760 --> 28:45.730
- Oui, maybe I'll get you a beret.
- You cannot handle me in a beret.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.724
- Is that what you think? I can't...
- Hey!

28:48.800 --> 28:50.040
Get a shroom.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.611
- Good luck.
- You, too.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.966
Okay.

28:56.000 --> 29:04.000
Give him the formula.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.451
You want to give it to him.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.602
You'll feel better about yourself

29:09.800 --> 29:13.327
if you stop being such an annoying
little brat and give him the formula.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.729
Make her stop. It burns.

29:20.800 --> 29:25.044
Hackus tell you everything I know.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.840
Hackus doesn't know anything.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.842
What? What?

29:30.920 --> 29:32.729
"Buffering"? What the...

29:34.200 --> 29:35.486
My public awaits.

29:35.560 --> 29:39.645
Once again I must go astound
and confound the merry imbeciles.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.649
What do you mean, I'm out of essence?

29:43.760 --> 29:46.047
We can still do the show, all right.

29:46.760 --> 29:51.482
Because we got all the essence we need
right here now, don't we?

29:52.360 --> 29:54.044
I'm going to need a little snip.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.850
Oh, no!

29:55.960 --> 29:58.850
Just going to take a little
off around the ears.

29:58.920 --> 29:59.921
There.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.247
When my Papa gets here,
you're gonna be sorry.

30:02.440 --> 30:06.525
Your Papa is not coming
because your real Papa is already here.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.965
- Yeah!
- Now,

30:08.080 --> 30:11.527
you can either be a good little girl
and give me the formula,

30:11.600 --> 30:15.002
or you can spend the rest
of your miserable little existence

30:15.080 --> 30:19.324
being harvested
inside my new superpowered Smurfalator!

30:19.400 --> 30:21.323
Your call entirely. Really.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.851
UP to you.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.843
Father! Father!

30:25.760 --> 30:26.966
Yes!

30:27.120 --> 30:28.360
Nice work, my dear.

30:28.440 --> 30:31.330
And as for you, nice try.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.401
Yes, Azrael.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.682
You can press the button
on the Smurfalator.

30:36.760 --> 30:37.841
Come, come, come!

30:38.040 --> 30:40.441
We'll brew this hair into Smurf essence!

30:42.920 --> 30:45.969
Papa, please hurry.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.929
I'm so scared.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.368
Poor baby's gonna cry.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.930
Hello, pretty lady.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.321
Hackus pretty, too.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.000
- Hi.
- Hello.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.447
I was just wondering if you could be
so kind as to tell me what room...

31:07.640 --> 31:09.369
What room Monsieur Gargamel is in?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.648
No. Hotel policy.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.281
Just right over there. Thanks.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.000
Here we are, guys, the Paris Opera House.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.807
- Not too shabby.
- Gargamel's really come up in the world.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.481
I hope Smurfette's here.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.684
I do love a good musical. Guilty!

31:38.520 --> 31:41.126
- What did he just say?
- I have no idea.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.842
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.447
I asked for a shroud of mystery.
This is a wisp!

32:04.080 --> 32:06.686
Alakazatmosphere!

32:07.720 --> 32:09.165
Holy smurf!

32:09.400 --> 32:12.927
- Where did that come from?
- He's never had this much power before.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.010
Well, I am outraged!

32:29.200 --> 32:30.406
Positively outraged.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.409
I'm sorry, who are you?

32:32.600 --> 32:37.128
I am Monsieur Gargamel's manager,
Madame Doolittle.

32:37.880 --> 32:41.123
What is this outhouse you call a room?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.362
- The Napoleon Suite?
- Napoleon Suite? Yes.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.130
But, Madame,
this is the finest room in all the hotel.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.884
What could possibly...

32:47.040 --> 32:50.123
Well, for starters, darling,
it's on the wrong floor.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.168
No one wants to be on the...

32:52.400 --> 32:55.961
- The fifth floor.
- Yes. Yes, that's much too low.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.490
Oh, boy.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.361
Good evening! Good evening!

33:01.400 --> 33:02.765
Okay, guys, we're going in.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.960
No, no, no.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.167
Great.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.163
Okay, Papa,
sneak out the back of my sweater

33:11.320 --> 33:13.521
while I talk to this man
who has no idea what I'm saying

33:13.560 --> 33:14.891
and go find that dressing room.

33:15.080 --> 33:19.165
This is a great vacation, guys.
I can feel the stress melting right off me.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.323
- Don't spiral, Grouchy.
- Yeah. We got this.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.086
- Gentlemen, we have a cat problem.
- Get down, get down.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.923
There! No, no, don't be alarmed.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.162
This is how I treat all the critics.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.125
Hurry, up those ropes.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.004
Is Smurfette really worth all this?

33:37.080 --> 33:38.445
- I'm just saying.
- Let's go.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.086
- Not permis. Not permis.
- What? This is outrageous.

33:41.240 --> 33:43.163
Your families will all pay dearly.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.846
As a result, some of you may die.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.251
No, I'm sorry, you will need your key card.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.091
Yes, of course, darling, my key card!

34:06.040 --> 34:08.202
Oh, dear, I've left it.

34:08.679 --> 34:13.208
Oui, I was having breakfast at Tiffany's.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.489
I'll just go back and get it.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.322
I bet my glutes look great
climbing up this rope.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.925
Grouchy, take a look.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.047
I hate my life.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.286
- Clumsy!
- Move it.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.440
Interrupt my sorcery,
at least I should be amused.

34:37.480 --> 34:43.089
Now, you will all kindly hail to the great
and exceedingly powerful Gargamel...

34:43.320 --> 34:45.527
What are you doing out here? How dare you?

34:46.840 --> 34:49.491
You smell something suspicious?
Well, of course you do!

34:49.639 --> 34:51.051
I've seen where you put your nose.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.690
Now, get out of here.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.841
Hi, Daddy.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.327
- Blue?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just listen...

34:56.400 --> 34:58.480
Blue and I decided
we can't let you run solo on this.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.561
We can do this together.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.291
Three generations of proud Doyle men
standing shoulder to shoulder.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.560
Even though we're all
different heights and whatnot.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.762
We are not Doyle men.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.160
Winslow-hyphen-Doyle.

35:09.240 --> 35:12.244
You have a bee in your bonnet
about the whole name thing.

35:12.400 --> 35:13.401
Why do you chortle?

35:13.480 --> 35:16.529
Usually, in magic, the cats are big, no?

35:16.680 --> 35:18.808
Like tiger or like lions, you know?

35:19.040 --> 35:22.408
Silence, knave! And allow me to oblige you.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.482
Alakazanimal!

35:33.400 --> 35:35.209
Try not to smell delicious!

35:35.320 --> 35:37.800
So far, this is the worst trip of my life!

35:38.040 --> 35:39.371
And I've only taken two!

35:39.440 --> 35:42.171
- Look! There's Gargamel's dressing room.
- Good eye, Vanity.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.242
Please! He's got a star on his door.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.367
Let's go.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.727
Remind me to put a star
on my mushroom when we get home.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.722
- If we ever want to be blue...
- Blue.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.689
We've got to come up with
some way to get her talking.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.569
- Yeah.
- Got any ideas?

35:55.680 --> 35:58.047
I got it! Say "please."

35:58.120 --> 36:00.885
Never mind. I forgot you were you.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.728
- All right, here's my plan.
- Okay.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.804
We trick her into
acting like us, being naughty.

36:06.880 --> 36:07.927
Naughty, naughty!

36:08.000 --> 36:10.287
We use all her goodness against her.

36:10.360 --> 36:14.126
Once that happens,
she'll feel like she's part of our family!

36:14.280 --> 36:16.408
Family! I like family!

36:16.600 --> 36:17.931
I love this plan!

36:18.080 --> 36:19.161
- Oh, no!
- Broken family!

36:20.960 --> 36:23.645
- Get her!
- Catch her! Catch Smurfette!

36:23.720 --> 36:25.609
See you later, Smurfigators!

36:25.760 --> 36:28.445
Father's gonna kill us! Go faster!

36:28.920 --> 36:32.208
- Au revoir, trolls!
- Get her!

36:32.280 --> 36:33.247
- Hello?
- Smurfette?

36:33.320 --> 36:34.560
- Where are you?
- Quick question.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.723
How is it we can't reach a doorknob,
but we can get up here?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.046
No, Clumsy, don't! No, no!

36:46.160 --> 36:49.004
You just lost a fight to an empty room.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.083
Nobody wants to come up here

36:51.160 --> 36:54.323
and play with the larger kitty
that they so annoyingly asked for!

36:54.480 --> 36:55.481
You have to go! Now!

36:55.640 --> 36:57.608
- Yeah, soon as we get the Smurfette.
- Yeah!

36:58.120 --> 36:59.804
- He coughs up everything he eats.
- You!

37:00.440 --> 37:03.125
Magic man, hand over the Smurfette.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.801
What did you just say?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.570
You heard me.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.927
Give me the Smurfette! Now!

37:09.120 --> 37:11.646
How dare you? Alaka...

37:11.840 --> 37:12.921
- Duck!
- ...duck!

37:14.360 --> 37:15.566
Duck?

37:20.480 --> 37:21.606
That was... up.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.250
No!

37:23.320 --> 37:24.321
You.

37:24.520 --> 37:27.729
By great Merlin's beard, I remember you!

37:30.160 --> 37:31.685
We meet again, eh?

37:31.760 --> 37:35.162
Daddy's flying! Daddy's flying!

37:37.560 --> 37:40.848
Well, well, well,
it appears we have a volunteer after all!

37:42.160 --> 37:45.050
Enough fooling around, yes?
Open wide, Azrael.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.004
Put him down, Gargafella!

37:53.240 --> 37:54.890
Leave my son alone!

37:55.000 --> 37:57.287
I'll teach you to mess with us Doyle ducks!

38:09.640 --> 38:10.641
You again!

38:10.800 --> 38:12.882
What are you doing? Put me down!

38:13.040 --> 38:14.041
Come on, Blue.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.601
Put me down! I could have taken him!
I had him!

38:18.800 --> 38:20.802
I'm afraid that's all the show
we have time for.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.490
Good bye.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.927
Go on, get out, get out, get out.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.202
Smurfette's hair. She's been here.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.203
Look! I found something.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.851
A portrait of perfection.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.641
Imagine how good you'd look
if you were actually helping.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.643
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

38:36.720 --> 38:39.007
- Smurfette?
- Smurfette?

38:39.080 --> 38:40.286
Hey, is that coffee?

38:41.480 --> 38:43.482
Anyone else want a cup o' joe?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.641
Hey, what's that?

38:46.760 --> 38:48.569
It's a mirror, you barbarian.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.444
Snap out of it, Vanity, and push!

38:52.720 --> 38:54.165
Rage before beauty.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.766
Whatever this is,
it's making my butt scrunch.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.204
That's a little scary. I mean...

39:00.440 --> 39:02.488
Gargamel!

39:04.600 --> 39:07.729
Clumsy! Are you trying to get us smurfed?

39:07.800 --> 39:10.201
It's some sort of magic window.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.044
Maybe it'll show us where Smurfette is.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.121
Naughties?

39:14.600 --> 39:16.329
- Gargamel!
- Quickly, pick it up.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.882
Quickly, to me, to me!

39:19.000 --> 39:21.367
Smurfette? Hello?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.483
Where did you go? Hello?

39:23.640 --> 39:25.324
- Move, Smurfs.
- Here he comes. Hurry.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.164
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Where are you? Are you here?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.841
- Children? Smurfette?
- Back up, back up.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.606
Close the door! Close the door!

39:31.720 --> 39:33.245
Your papa is back.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.206
Her papa?

39:35.280 --> 39:37.931
If this is a joke,
I assure you I don't find it funny.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.643
- Hello?
- Hold it!

39:40.840 --> 39:44.561
- Are you down there, you little delinquents?
- Keep still.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.642
They must have retreated back to the hotel.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.044
Of course we're running out of time.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.926
If that Patrick person is here,
then Papa cannot be far behind.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.049
Quickly, to the hotel!
We must get to her before he does.

40:03.480 --> 40:04.970
My face! My face!

40:05.040 --> 40:07.407
- What?
- It's gorgeous.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.970
We fell, and it wasn't even my fault!

40:11.400 --> 40:13.164
Anyone? Anyone?

40:13.240 --> 40:17.086
Oh, my Smurf.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.962
I'm scrunching again.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.361
Papa, what does this
have to do with Smurfette?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.920
Everything, I'm afraid.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.129
Why would he build such a hideous device?

40:33.240 --> 40:35.766
Is that a giant Smurfalator?

40:35.840 --> 40:37.683
To extract our essence.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.563
What are all those containers for?

40:41.640 --> 40:45.008
Ninety-nine bottles of Smurf on the wall.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.924
So if Smurfette gives him the formula...

40:48.000 --> 40:53.291
He can turn as many Naughties into Smurfs
as his greedy heart desires.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.044
Guys?

41:03.480 --> 41:04.561
Oh, dear.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.410
Need a catch, please.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.401
This place really needs to recycle.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.962
Think, Smurfette, think. Oh, no!

41:17.040 --> 41:19.247
- Where's Smurfette? Where's Smurfette?
- There she is!

41:19.320 --> 41:21.641
She's fast! I love this game!

41:21.720 --> 41:25.327
Wait! Let's let her run for a bit.
She's got nowhere to go.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.448
- This is perfect for my plan!
- Yeah, yeah.

41:27.640 --> 41:30.246
What are you so cross about? I'm the duck!

41:30.400 --> 41:33.483
You always barge in and ruin everything!
You're like a walking disaster!

41:33.560 --> 41:35.244
Hey, look me in the eyes and say that.

41:35.440 --> 41:38.762
- I can't.
- That's right, because it's not true.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.600
No, I can't because your eyes
are on the sides of your head!

41:42.440 --> 41:45.364
All the better for me
to see your disrespect!

41:46.440 --> 41:48.329
- What are you looking at?
- Hurry up.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.329
It's global warming. Buy a Prius.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.681
Okay. Did I lose them?

41:57.600 --> 41:58.806
Good dog.

41:59.520 --> 42:02.285
No, no... Sorry. Excuse me.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.684
Okay, I got this.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.682
Papa, where are you?

42:20.400 --> 42:24.121
Why am I not surprised the way out of
Gargamel's lair is through a sewer?

42:24.200 --> 42:25.804
- Master Winslow.
- Papa!

42:25.880 --> 42:27.644
- Patrick, look.
- What happened?

42:27.800 --> 42:30.963
Gargamel is hatching a
terrible, terrible plan.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.605
What's with the duck?

42:33.800 --> 42:35.848
That's Victor.
Gargamel turned him into a duck.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.084
- Now Gargamel knows we're onto him.
- I was only trying to help!

42:39.320 --> 42:41.163
Victor, you look fowl.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.081
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

42:44.320 --> 42:47.563
Focus, everyone.
We've got to find Smurfette quickly.

42:48.240 --> 42:51.403
- There she is! Got her!
- Chase over?

42:52.200 --> 42:54.726
Hey, Hackus. See that candy store?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.081
- Candy? Candy!
- I've got an idea.

42:57.320 --> 43:00.767
Go get yourself in trouble. Be naughty!
I'll take care of the rest.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.844
I love to make trouble!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

43:05.800 --> 43:08.041
Hey, blondie. Where you going?

43:08.240 --> 43:09.605
Leave me alone.

43:09.680 --> 43:12.160
You mean like your so-called Papa has?

43:12.680 --> 43:14.205
No, he hasn't!

43:15.400 --> 43:17.164
He will come for me.

43:18.040 --> 43:23.046
He won't, because he knows
you're where you really belong.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.410
I didn't kidnap you, Smurfette.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.644
I brought you home.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.321
I'm gonna make big trouble.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.448
Yummy candy!

43:48.560 --> 43:49.607
Here comes trouble!

43:52.840 --> 43:54.285
Hello!

44:04.720 --> 44:08.520
Oh, my gosh!
He's gonna be killed! We have to help!

44:10.040 --> 44:11.644
I thought you were supposed to be good.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.171
But...

44:13.600 --> 44:15.011
Help!

44:15.200 --> 44:16.531
Oh, smurf.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.090
Okay, come on!

44:18.400 --> 44:21.483
Oh, no. I'm really in trouble now.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.967
- Vexy!
- Oh, no! Hackus!

44:24.080 --> 44:25.206
Help!

44:25.320 --> 44:26.765
Help Hackus.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.562
Smurfette, what are we gonna do?

44:31.080 --> 44:33.082
Vexy, give me a lift! Come on, jump!

44:36.080 --> 44:38.242
- Bull's-eye!
- Holy smurf!

44:38.440 --> 44:41.523
- Good one, Smurfette!
- Blend that, candy man!

44:41.760 --> 44:42.807
Come on, Hackus!

44:44.560 --> 44:46.722
Vexy, let's go!

44:50.600 --> 44:51.761
Hold on!

44:52.040 --> 44:53.565
Look out!

44:53.760 --> 44:55.649
Nice move, stealing a cart.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.008
I didn't exactly steal it.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.603
- Sorry!
- Well, it's not yours, is it?

45:00.680 --> 45:01.966
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.122
See? You're just like us.

45:05.640 --> 45:09.884
How am I going to get Smurfette
to give me that formula, Azrael?

45:09.960 --> 45:12.122
This whole thing just makes me want to...

45:12.840 --> 45:15.161
Cry? No. Flush her down the toilet bowl.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.844
There must be something we can do.

45:16.920 --> 45:20.641
I know you only have a tiny little
pea-sized brain in there, but think!

45:21.800 --> 45:24.201
Is it her birthday? Really? Who cares?

45:25.920 --> 45:28.287
A present? A cake?

45:28.360 --> 45:29.407
Be nice to her?

45:32.680 --> 45:37.322
Bribery and flattery
to soften her stony little heart, eh?

45:37.400 --> 45:40.449
That's counterintuitive,
but that just might work.

45:41.160 --> 45:43.208
I'm so glad I thought of this!

45:44.160 --> 45:45.605
Let's see...

45:46.360 --> 45:47.361
All right, all right.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.085
What kind of gift should I get her?

45:49.240 --> 45:51.322
- Kitty, kitty, kitty!
- Hey, fish breath!

45:53.520 --> 45:55.568
Not now, Azrael, I'm trying to think of

45:55.640 --> 45:58.928
a genuine and heartfelt gift
that I can deceive that Smurfette with!

45:59.000 --> 46:00.365
I said not now!

46:01.520 --> 46:05.047
Not now! Not now! Not now!
Not now! Not now! Not now!

46:06.360 --> 46:07.850
You are walking home.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.361
Cats.

46:12.360 --> 46:13.521
Faster! Faster!

46:13.640 --> 46:14.607
Excuse us! Sorry!

46:14.680 --> 46:16.205
How are we gonna stop this thing?

46:16.640 --> 46:18.688
I don't think that's gonna be a problem!

46:19.600 --> 46:21.682
And she sticks the landing!

46:25.240 --> 46:28.323
- Yummy pudding!
- Hackus, it's mud.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.050
Yummy mud!

46:33.320 --> 46:35.243
Take your best shot, cat!

46:36.000 --> 46:37.047
Watch out!

46:40.440 --> 46:41.441
Yes!

46:41.600 --> 46:43.568
- Nice shot! Let's go!
- Nice shot! Let's go!

46:44.080 --> 46:45.969
- Come on!
- Move it or lose it, Hackus!

46:46.040 --> 46:49.249
Oh, no! Angry kitty! Angry kitty! Run!

46:49.680 --> 46:51.569
Okay, ladies, act pregnant.

46:51.680 --> 46:52.841
- This way, guys!
- Faster!

46:52.920 --> 46:54.729
- It's time to get your wings!
- Faster!

46:54.800 --> 46:56.086
Quick, get on the storks!

46:56.240 --> 46:57.366
Let's go!

46:57.440 --> 46:58.441
Wait, where's Hackus?

46:59.440 --> 47:00.965
Fly. Big stork, fly!

47:01.440 --> 47:03.841
Here comes kitty! Look out!

47:04.440 --> 47:06.408
Come on, Hackus! Let's go!

47:08.880 --> 47:10.211
Yeah!

47:10.760 --> 47:13.047
Hey, look, it's a catfish!

47:13.120 --> 47:15.282
Bye, kitty!

47:16.240 --> 47:18.527
This is amazing!

47:19.000 --> 47:22.163
Stork going backwards!
Stork going backwards!

47:26.120 --> 47:28.930
This is so beautiful!

47:30.440 --> 47:32.363
I'm falling! I'm falling!

47:33.920 --> 47:36.048
Smurfette's my hero!

47:37.840 --> 47:39.600
- How did it go?
- Couldn't have gone better.

47:39.640 --> 47:42.291
Except that everything
was a complete smurftastrophe.

47:43.120 --> 47:44.485
It's Smurfy's Law.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.847
Well, I have some good news.

47:46.920 --> 47:52.404
I borrowed a waiter's outfit for you, complete
with a security card for the elevator.

47:52.640 --> 47:53.641
How did you manage that?

47:53.960 --> 47:57.089
Let's just say that the Plaza Athénée
laundry room was paid a little visit

47:57.240 --> 48:01.211
by international apparel
inspector Mademoiselle Doolittle.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.169
I was like Meryl smurfin' Streep.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.770
Good job, Grace!

48:05.880 --> 48:08.360
Does everyone get a new outfit,
or just Patrick?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.084
- Bloody window.
- What was that?

48:11.280 --> 48:12.247
That's Victor.

48:12.320 --> 48:15.722
They wouldn't let him through the lobby,
so he flew up.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.809
No depth perception.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.809
Grandpa Vicster is a duck!

48:21.160 --> 48:22.321
Gargamel zapped him.

48:22.760 --> 48:24.000
You can change him back, right?

48:24.360 --> 48:26.522
No, but it's a transformation spell.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.165
It'll wear off eventually.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.561
Everybody relax. It's not a problem.

48:30.640 --> 48:33.166
But if you see me lay an egg,
it's just between us.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.849
You don't seem too upset about this.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.207
It's not in a duck's nature to get upset.

48:39.280 --> 48:41.886
We like to let things roll off our backs.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.247
Seriously? You seriously just said that?

48:44.440 --> 48:47.171
- I like that. That's very smurfy of you.
- Very smurfy.

48:47.240 --> 48:48.571
Why, thank you. See?

48:48.760 --> 48:50.762
The little Santa Claus
Smurf appreciates me.

48:50.840 --> 48:54.731
Maybe someday, Patrick, you'll learn to
appreciate my smurf y qualities, too!

48:54.960 --> 48:56.928
Okay. I've... There's... You know...

48:57.160 --> 48:58.961
I'm not having this
conversation with a duck.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.444
Now I'm catching a cold.

49:02.520 --> 49:03.760
I wish I had a cold.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.128
I've had Hefty's crystal
shoved down my throat,

49:06.200 --> 49:09.044
got attacked as a corn dog,
fell down a sewer,

49:09.240 --> 49:11.527
and if that wasn't smelly enough,

49:11.680 --> 49:15.730
had to travel by armpit just to find
out we're all gonna be extinct!

49:16.520 --> 49:20.411
- Holy smurf, I'm a downer.
- You most certainly are.

49:20.680 --> 49:25.686
Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if
Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.002
- But Smurfette would never tell.
- Of course not.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.320
- Never.
- Absolutely not.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.290
Smurfette could never be
tricked into being one of them.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.526
Hey, Smurfette.

49:34.600 --> 49:37.046
Did you do this
with your sisters back in Smurf Village?

49:37.160 --> 49:40.642
Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.404
Well, you do now.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.086
- Want to race?
- You want to race me?

49:45.840 --> 49:47.729
You're in trouble now!

49:49.440 --> 49:51.602
- I'm gonna lose you, Smurfette.
- Not a chance.

50:01.280 --> 50:03.169
Watch out!

50:03.240 --> 50:04.844
Hold on tight, Hackus.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.808
- Not that tight, Hackus.
- Sorry.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.849
Stork fight!

50:10.760 --> 50:12.205
Coming through!

50:13.080 --> 50:14.764
This is insane!

50:16.280 --> 50:18.442
Smurf, smurf, and away.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.446
Hackus, king of world!

50:23.720 --> 50:25.529
You're playing dirty now!

50:25.720 --> 50:27.404
I'm just getting started.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.005
GO, go:

50:29.120 --> 50:31.088
I call that a Crepe Smurfette.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.848
Snails to go?

50:35.960 --> 50:38.008
- Batter up!
- Come on!

50:38.120 --> 50:40.202
Hit me with your best shot.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.841
Snailed her!

50:43.920 --> 50:46.048
- You are naughty, Smurfette.
- Yeah.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.642
Hey! I've seen that lady before.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.370
She's beautiful.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.489
They've got one of these everywhere.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.571
I'm gonna strangle that duck.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.688
Vic's like a black cloud
that follows me around.

51:04.080 --> 51:05.161
Okay, look, I get it.

51:05.320 --> 51:07.163
But you know what, he's here, isn't he?

51:07.320 --> 51:08.560
He shows up.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.529
Yeah, whether you want him to or not.

51:10.680 --> 51:13.160
Okay, I always heard that
showing up was 90% of the job.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.404
A lot of fathers don't even do that.

51:15.720 --> 51:17.324
He's not my father.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.403
Well, that's too bad.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.847
'Cause that pretty much
leaves you without one.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.844
- Patrick.
- All right, guys.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.570
- Game on.
- Let's do this!

51:38.640 --> 51:40.768
- I'm gonna stay with Blue.
- And Vic.

51:40.840 --> 51:43.366
Okay, Smurfs, off to Gargamel's hotel.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.965
Patrick,
there's actually something I'd like to...

51:45.080 --> 51:46.161
No "actuallys."

51:46.360 --> 51:47.441
You're staying here.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.000
That's not what I was even going...

51:49.080 --> 51:50.650
Victor, don't make me pluck you.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.165
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

51:52.320 --> 51:56.120
We're gonna get Smurfette this time,
100% guaranteed.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.890
What did you just say, Grouchy?

51:58.080 --> 52:03.041
You heard it. I'm tired of being Grouchy.
I am changing my tune to a happy one.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.089
From now on, lam...

52:05.200 --> 52:07.680
Ready? Positive Smurf.

52:07.760 --> 52:09.922
I sprained my face.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.487
You'll get used to it. Let's go, Smurfs.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.803
- Come on. Come on.
- A paper bag. First-class.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.769
- Hurry...
- Clumsy!

52:17.480 --> 52:19.244
Good luck, Daddy!

52:21.640 --> 52:23.210
Le chat VIP.

52:23.280 --> 52:25.851
Please, I will take you to your room.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.810
<i>- Front</i> desk.
<i>- Listen well, you slack-jawed knave.</i>

52:33.920 --> 52:35.001
Monsieur Gargamel.

52:35.160 --> 52:39.848
I want ale, curds and blistered meats
sent into my room in 10 minutes,

52:39.920 --> 52:43.242
or I will turn you into
a legless tree sloth.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.050
How was that, Smurfs?

52:47.880 --> 52:48.961
That's not funny, man.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.731
Duck, duck, duck.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.731
Goose!

53:04.040 --> 53:07.123
The security card for the elevator.
Patrick needs my help.

53:08.760 --> 53:13.527
When I show up with this, he'll see
this black cloud has got a silver...

53:13.960 --> 53:15.564
A silver lining!

53:28.800 --> 53:30.609
Oh, my...

53:30.680 --> 53:32.125
Master Winslow, please.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.801
- You can't get a reservation...
- Focus.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.490
That smells delish!

53:38.240 --> 53:39.685
Le bingo.

53:43.440 --> 53:47.570
Okay, guys, listen, when you get to
the room, if there's any problems...

53:48.640 --> 53:52.326
- Snot on a half shell. Delicacy.
- Sorry, Mr. Fish!

53:53.160 --> 53:54.491
You look fried.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.200
Like I said, if there are any problems...

53:56.360 --> 53:58.283
My friend,
there are no such thing as problems.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.010
Only smurfitunities.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.481
- You're freaking me out, Grouchy.
- Positive!

54:02.640 --> 54:04.210
Of...

54:10.480 --> 54:12.403
Okay, guys, we're in.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.482
Patrick Winslow-Doyle.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.121
Patrick.

54:18.720 --> 54:21.690
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your tail feather. Now come here.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.370
I've got something
you need for your mission.

54:23.520 --> 54:24.920
Hurry up. There's no time to argue.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.887
- What?
- It's the security card for the elevator.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.242
I have the security card.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.684
What is this? This is our room key.

54:36.640 --> 54:39.166
Well, now when you come back,
you'll be able to get in.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.566
- No problem.
- I can't...

54:41.000 --> 54:42.001
No, no, no, no, no.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.281
You're welcome.

54:44.440 --> 54:46.442
You can thank me later.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.045
How did you get out?

54:48.200 --> 54:49.440
Now, you just put me back down.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.760
Patrick, help!

54:50.960 --> 54:53.611
- We need you for our duck é I'orange.
- You want a piece of me?

54:53.760 --> 54:55.842
No, no, no, no! That's not what I meant.

54:55.920 --> 54:59.208
Yeah, it starts with the ducks,
and soon, no one's safe!

54:59.600 --> 55:01.682
- Unbelievable.
- Patrick!

55:04.520 --> 55:05.521
Master Winslow?

55:05.600 --> 55:07.443
- Patrick!
- Where'd he go?

55:07.800 --> 55:09.325
- He disappeared.
- Now we're on our own.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.811
- Well...
- Hide!

55:12.840 --> 55:14.171
Monsieur Gargamel.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.446
We're smurf ed. Plan B, anybody?

55:22.520 --> 55:24.682
I'm struggling to remain positive here.

55:30.240 --> 55:32.163
Monsieur Gargamel?

55:33.040 --> 55:34.121
Room service.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.410
Hello, kitty.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.081
Here is your room service.

55:40.240 --> 55:44.040
- What do we do?
- Smurf him with the element of surprise.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.650
Oh, Clumsy!

55:48.520 --> 55:49.760
- Oh, dear.
- Now what do we do?

55:50.760 --> 55:52.091
Just act scary.

55:52.280 --> 55:53.566
What?

55:53.680 --> 55:56.126
I'm a scary ghost!

55:56.400 --> 55:57.447
Nice.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.645
Why do so many bad things
happen to little blue people?

56:01.800 --> 56:03.643
Positive, positive.

56:03.880 --> 56:07.327
Window! Window! Window!

56:10.120 --> 56:13.044
Oh, no!

56:13.560 --> 56:16.211
Are you smurfing kidding me?
You nearly killed...

56:17.080 --> 56:19.287
I mean, look at this view.

56:23.720 --> 56:29.682
If it looks like a duck, quacks like a
duck, and smells like a corn dog...

56:29.880 --> 56:31.882
All right, which one of you is Vic?

56:31.960 --> 56:33.803
What, you don't recognise your own father?

56:35.440 --> 56:37.886
- Let's go.
- What about my brothers?

56:37.960 --> 56:39.803
We can't just leave them here to be eaten.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.240
You just met them.

56:41.480 --> 56:44.324
This is my flock.
I can't just leave them behind.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.201
Come on, if you're game, so am I.

56:50.200 --> 56:52.567
I am covered in filth.

56:52.800 --> 56:55.087
I look like something the cat dragged in!

56:57.840 --> 56:59.922
Come on, it's not that bad.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.288
Although, if I don't... The cat!

57:02.520 --> 57:05.683
- Not the face. Not the face!
- Close the lid!

57:08.120 --> 57:10.407
- That was awesome!
- Thank you!

57:10.840 --> 57:13.002
Hackus lives!

57:13.080 --> 57:14.366
Vexy, come and help me close the door.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.090
- Thank you, bird.
- Bye.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.929
That was crazy.

57:19.080 --> 57:21.924
Bye-bye, birds. I had fun.

57:22.360 --> 57:23.361
Yeah.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.562
- High fours!
- High fours!

57:25.640 --> 57:28.120
Hackus, Hackus, Hackus.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.362
It's so nice having another girl around.

57:32.960 --> 57:33.961
What are you doing?

57:34.440 --> 57:37.046
I’m just hugging you.

57:37.720 --> 57:39.927
Haven't you ever been hugged?

57:43.560 --> 57:45.130
Vexy...

57:49.880 --> 57:52.884
- Hackus hug. Hackus hug.
- Hackus.

57:52.960 --> 57:54.803
Hackus squeeze!

57:54.880 --> 57:56.245
Hackus.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.971
I'm positive we should
just leave him in here.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.087
Thanks.

58:00.320 --> 58:04.291
Hurry. They're probably doing something
mean and horrible to her right now.

58:04.440 --> 58:07.762
Yeah, Smurfette needs us.
She's probably scared and...

58:09.280 --> 58:11.362
- I love family!
- What...

58:11.920 --> 58:13.251
What is she doing?

58:13.320 --> 58:15.322
I think they're hugging.

58:15.400 --> 58:16.561
Papa?

58:16.800 --> 58:18.325
Hackus love to hug.

58:18.400 --> 58:19.811
Hackus.

58:19.880 --> 58:22.406
Smurfette, come on,
I got to show you something.

58:23.440 --> 58:27.161
Look at us. Come on, tell
me we're not family.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.961
Smurfette!

58:31.040 --> 58:32.166
Over here!

58:32.240 --> 58:33.321
Smurfette!

58:33.400 --> 58:36.449
I'm sorry Papa Smurf didn't come for you.

58:36.520 --> 58:41.003
But maybe your place is here with us.

58:42.520 --> 58:43.965
Yeah.

58:44.400 --> 58:45.606
Maybe it is.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.282
Why is she being nice to them?

58:48.480 --> 58:52.121
She's just identifying with her captors.
It's classic Smurf-holm syndrome.

58:52.280 --> 58:56.410
No, she thinks we don't care anymore,
and they do.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.811
She's confused.

58:58.120 --> 59:01.169
Clumsy, Grouchy, get up there,
and help me get this door open.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.321
- That's my daughter in there!
- Okay, Papa.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.563
- I'll get on top.
- Okay, Grouchy, you jump, I'll pull.

59:05.640 --> 59:08.086
- Come on, we can do this.
- Children.

59:08.240 --> 59:11.289
- Gargamel!
- Clumsy, don't let go...

59:11.800 --> 59:13.211
Daddy's home.

59:13.320 --> 59:18.281
And consistent with his kind nature,
he brought you a present.

59:18.480 --> 59:19.606
Grouchy, get down. He'll see you.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.967
- How are we gonna rescue her now?
- Quiet.

59:22.160 --> 59:24.766
I do believe
we got off on the wrong foot earlier.

59:24.840 --> 59:25.887
What's happening?

59:25.960 --> 59:29.726
Would you allow me to wish you
a very, very happy birthday?

59:30.640 --> 59:32.290
It seems like only yesterday

59:32.360 --> 59:36.604
you were just my little glob of clay
and other putrid ingredients.

59:36.840 --> 59:40.401
You remembered my birthday?

59:40.480 --> 59:42.926
Of course I did. We're family.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.491
- What?
- But we're her family.

59:44.600 --> 59:47.365
- Families don't forget things like that.
- Does she think we abandoned her?

59:47.560 --> 59:51.087
Speaking of which, your little blue
step-papa never did arrive, now did he?

59:51.160 --> 59:52.525
Step-papa?

59:52.680 --> 59:56.002
Why, I am truly sorry, my dear.
That must really sting.

59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.644
I remember when my father
threw me down the well for the first time.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.964
The disappointed look on his face
when I finally managed to claw my way out.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.165
Anyway, happy birthday, my dear.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.924
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!
- Happy birthday, Smurfette!

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.486
- I want to open! Let me open!
- No, no, no.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.886
Ugly.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.522
"Bow. Kneel. Worship me."

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.569
Yes, delightful rendition, really.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.921
Keep it up, no-neck,
I'll turn you into a cross-eyed newt.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.964
Yes, yes, my dear.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.565
Go ahead, take it.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.884
It's a tiny little magical wand
of your very own.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.884
Go ahead. It's your birthday present.

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.885
No.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.530
Don't do it.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.608
Do you like it?

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.288
Silly me. I've forgotten to turn it on.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.129
Here we are.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.048
Yes, there we go.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.770
Yes, go ahead, try it out. Don't be afraid.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.968
- A Dragon Wand.
- Oh, dear.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.090
After all, it is your birthright.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.403
How do you know I won't use it on you?

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.606
Well...

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:31.129
Because, Smurfette, I am your father.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.329
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.051
- She's gonna zap him.
- Get him, Smurfette.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.526
Smurfette...

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.523
<i>Sing The La La Song.</i>

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.801
Sing it!

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.250
This is good, right, Papa?

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.846
No! She's becoming one of them!

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.611
I have always wanted to do this!

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.365
We're losing her.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.848
- Yes! Good one, Smurfette.
- Your first cat zap.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.526
Look at you. Look at you.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.330
You truly are daddy's little girl.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.768
- Smurfette!
- No, Papa! Grouchy, grab him!

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.570
- No, Papa, he's gonna see you!
- Get him down!

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.680
- Clumsy, help, help me get him down!
- Papa, no!

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.684
Yeah!

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.687
No!

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.771
Take to the skies, lads.
Free at last! Free at last!

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.366
- What are you, Martin Luther Wing?
- That's it.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.048
Joke it up, funny boy, but I am proud
as a peacock to be a freedom flighter.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.727
Oh, no.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.689
What the... is that?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.846
Hang on, Smurfs! Victor's on the way!

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.889
Pop your smurf-chutes.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.240
The flying V!

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.283
Gotcha.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.286
Okay, don't panic.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.362
That is a lot of white meat.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.571
Now panic!

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.405
Me no likey!

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.287
That was brilliant.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.883
- He's naked, right?
- Everyone okay?

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.084
Help me, somebody.
Somebody please, let me out!

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.601
I have seen unspeakable things down there.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.680
I have been scarred for life.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.049
Where's Smurfette?

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.042
- She's...
- Where's Smurfette?

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.765
We were too late.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.081
Nice going.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.804
Have fun, children.
Just remember, be kind to each other.

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.087
Will you get away from me,
you bumbling moron?

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.844
- Where are they?
- What?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.764
Smurfs were here? In this room?
Why didn't you say so?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.524
Right now!

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.641
She must not learn of this.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.921
We must spirit her away from here
and get that formula now.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.449
Smurfette, my dear,
are you ready to go celebrate?

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.204
- Yeah!
- Come on, come on. This'll be fun.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.446
We were this close to
getting Smurfette back.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:16.521
I know.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.410
He distracted me
at the worst possible moment, Grace.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.289
I would have been in the elevator
if it wasn't for him.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.125
Okay, okay, use your indoor voice,
and please, Patrick, just breathe.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.890
I want him gone.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.770
- He's your dad.
- No, that's one thing he is not.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.127
He's right, Grace. I'm not his father.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:34.687
His real father left and
started a new family.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.404
He's been chewed up about it ever since.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.163
- Excuse me?
- As well you might.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.842
But I can't take the brunt of it anymore.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.567
Hey, I never asked
for you to come barging into my life, okay?

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.566
I didn't ask you to
marry my mother or take away Zeus.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.087
Zeus? The pigeon?

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.290
The parrot.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.930
My parrot.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.129
Taken away because you were allergic.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.169
I was not allergic to that bird, Patrick.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.486
Yes, you were.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.527
No, I wasn't.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.647
You were.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.685
What?

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.043
It got so bad, every day,
you were wheezing, coughing.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.607
Your mother and I both knew
that it would break your heart

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:22.206
to think the bird
had to go away because of you.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.761
You already blamed yourself for your dad.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.080
So I took the heat.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.521
That's a lie. What are you...
I'm not allergic to birds.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.924
Okay, tell you what.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.521
Sniff my feathers.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.247
- I'm not going to...
- Come on, sniff them.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.041
Truth itches, doesn't it?

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.002
Listen to me, Patrick.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.367
I loved your mother with all my heart.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.842
I took care of Jeannette,
and I made her happy.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.811
I also chose to love you as my own.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.370
Now, I didn't have to do that.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:07.765
But you were this little kid, no father, no
hope in his eyes, a big hole in his heart,

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.410
so I gave you everything I could.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.923
But I'm done, you know?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.526
You don't want it, that's fine.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.002
My last word of advice to you is this...

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.206
Will you grow up?

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.730
Stop blaming everyone else for your pain.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.041
And whatever you do,

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:29.684
don't teach that beautiful son of yours that
love is conditional, because it is not.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.403
Good bye, Grace.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.089
Bye-bye, Blue.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.368
G rand pa Vicster.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.161
Bye.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.564
Goodbye, Patrick Winslow.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.446
Look at that big wheel.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.330
Come. Come along, my dear.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.729
So this is why they call
it the City of Light.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.404
There's a lot of people.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.569
Yes, well...

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.883
I prefer to call them "worshippers."

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.405
"Worshippers."

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.969
Alakakneel!

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.130
Bow. Kneel.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.445
Hackus.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.568
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.964
Don't worry. Everyone likes it.
He's a celebrity. Come on.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.326
Okay.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.768
Yes, hello. It's me.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.451
- These are my children.
- Hi.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.124
- Who's that?
- That's my brother.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.281
Hi. I'm Hackus.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.962
Look at that. It's a magical creature.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.810
Hi.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.211
It's my birthday.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.847
Thank you.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.127
- I have a FASTPASS.
- Yeah, FASTPASS.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.650
Monsieur Gargamel!

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.521
Thank you for keeping our seats warm.
Goodbye.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.687
Bye-bye!

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.849
Come along, children. Right this way.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.004
Monsieur Gargamel! Monsieur Gargamel!

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.930
Let's go!

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.286
- Father.
- Not now.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:23.770
It's feeding time soon.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.763
- Not now!
- But“.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.046
Here we are.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.761
- Our fun is just beginning, eh?
- Yeah.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.166
Alakazelevate!

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.611
But isn't this lovely, my dear?

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.849
And just think,

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:52.288
with your secret formula
and my incredible magic,

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:56.410
there's absolutely nothing
that we cannot do.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.323
Yeah.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:02.529
Think of all the fun we
could have, Smurfette.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.285
Okay.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:12.807
Then why are we going so slow?

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.841
- Look out!
- Yeah!

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.524
Isn't this fun?

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.170
Decidedly not!

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.281
Best ride ever! Smurfette's fun, huh?

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.490
Incoming!

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.291
Look out! Coming through!

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.771
Sorry!

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.130
I must have failed her.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.809
Sorry. I was looking for a place to think.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.566
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.325
I was doing a little thinking myself.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:42.964
Master Winslow, it's hard for me,

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.442
but, well, can I ask you some advice?

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.483
I mean, papa to Papa-

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.324
It's about Smurfette.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.844
I don't know what to do.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.128
I turned her blue.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.010
I taught her love and kindness.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.010
But the truth is, Gargamel made her.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.130
She's only a Smurf
as long as she chooses to be.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:08.561
But what if she doesn't?

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.447
What if she chooses him?

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.682
We could lose her.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.683
We may have already.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.329
I haven't done enough.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.765
Are you kidding?

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.327
Gargamel just made her, but you,

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.811
you made her what she is.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.770
You stepped in and loved her
as your very own.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.042
No one asked you to, you just did.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.647
Because you knew she needed that.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.848
And that's a...

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.921
That's a pretty special kind of love.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.722
She's way too smart not to see that.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.970
You're right.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.725
We didn't believe in her
because she changed.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.201
She changed because we believed in her.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.650
Thank you, Master Winslow.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.088
That was exactly what I needed to hear.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.410
Me, too.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.290
Just a few more bubbles.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.925
How's that?

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.243
Sweet Smurf in Heaven,
what have you eaten?

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.762
It's okay.
Every time a Smurf toots, someone smiles.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.011
- Let's go, Smurfs.
- Where?

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.286
We're getting Smurfette.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.204
But you saw her, Papa.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.205
She's one of them now.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.009
- A horse whisperer?
- No!

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.088
- A French Socialist?
- No!

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.286
A Flying Wallenda!

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.169
No, she's with Gargamel. Keep up.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.044
I don't care what we saw.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.441
You never give up on family.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.443
Yeah, Papa's right.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.841
Who are you,
and what have you done with Grouchy?

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.048
Hey, I'm Positive, remember?

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:54.171
All right, Smurfs. Let's get smurfing.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.282
Master Winslow, you coming with us?

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.965
Is a Smurf's butt blue?

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.486
You tell me.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.046
Grouchy.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.051
- Put it away.
- Anybody else?

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.762
Okay, then. Out of the tub with you.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.921
- We've got work to do.
- Hey.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.128
Let's smurf this mushroom stand.
Let's roll.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.402
Yeah, guys, let's do this.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.441
Victor? Hey.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.043
Okay, Master Winslow, we'll split up here.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:58.322
All right. I'll find the
electrical room and cut the power.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.521
And we'll find Smurfette.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.682
And we'll all look fabulous doing it.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.366
Oh, come on.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.408
Team building. Hello!

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.040
All right, see you inside. Good luck.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.043
- Come on, guys.
- Into the belly of the beast.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.647
Why are we coming down here, Father?

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.731
Well, we are celebrating
your long-lost sister's birthday.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.801
Really?

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.281
Can't very well end the festivities without

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.206
a cake.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.722
I made you your favourite, my dear.
Blue velvet.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.526
Cake.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:36.649
Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish, my dear.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.282
Anything your tiny little heart
can dream of, and it is yours.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.090
Anything?

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.446
But of course.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.890
Yes, well, within reason.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.244
I'm afraid we're on a bit
of an essence budget around here lately.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.767
That's why we need the formula, you see.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.244
There she is.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.289
Is that a birthday cake?

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.249
We had a birthday cake for her, too.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.841
She just never saw it.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.890
They look like a happy family.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.327
She's not going to give him the formula,
is she, Papa?

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.961
If she does,
it would mean the end of all Smurf kind.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.682
Wait. Even the handsome ones?

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.768
- Yeah.
- Vanity, you come with me.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.127
Clumsy and Grouchy,
go meet Master Winslow.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.209
Victor, what are you doing here?

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.406
Grace called me.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.648
She said you might need a hand.

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.329
No, no. Victor, wait.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.922
As usual, Grace is right.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.927
I could use some help.

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:57.683
Well, for starters,
you might try lifting the sewer cover.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.680
Unless you're planning
on fixing the phone lines?

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.968
Smurfette, the formula?

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.923
Take all the time you need, my dear.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.724
As long as it's very, very soon.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.730
Then we can all be blue. Together.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.123
Hackus blue. Hackus blue.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.244
You see? They want to be blue,

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.483
just like their big sister.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.685
Then we could be a real family.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.003
This is something.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.404
A sacred gift entrusted to me.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.850
I'm sorry.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.724
I just, I...

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.526
I can't.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.966
What do you mean, you can't?

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.371
I've given you everything.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.570
Kindness, presents,

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.803
a cake with no poison. It's been horrible!

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.565
Now, I have had just about enough of this,
young lady.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.450
You are going to give me
what I want right now!

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.885
- The formula!
- No!

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.961
Yes!

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.371
- Father?
- What, what, what?

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.331
Hackus dizzy.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.010
What's happening to them?

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.446
So dizzy.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.967
Don't tell me you actually care
for these pathetic creatures.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.326
How sad for you.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.250
And how absolutely perfect for me.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.960
It looks like the power lines run this way.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.809
Let's go! Let's go!
We got to get her out of there!

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.370
All right, let's do this!

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.648
This way, Vanity. Through this pipe.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.008
We have to save her!
This could be my moment!

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.851
I'm so sorry, my dear. I thought you knew.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.242
Without essence, they cannot live.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.811
- Father.
- No.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.121
Please.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.850
No. Vexy.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.522
So dizzy.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.321
- Hackus.
- Smurfette.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.922
Give them what you have!
Take some from me.

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.041
Take some!

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.161
Please!

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.766
What's the point?
You won't give me the formula,

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.686
so, well, I might as well just let them go.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.161
Vexy.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.291
You mean you'd let them die?

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.289
I can always make others.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.200
Besides, I am not the one letting them die.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.726
You are.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.088
Okay. Okay.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.364
I'll give it to you. Just feed them.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.489
The formula first.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.286
Feed them. Feed them!

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.925
Quickly. We have to get in there.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.128
- Dead end!
- It's locked!

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.162
The formu-la-la-la-la-la-la.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.165
One hopeful thought.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.442
A dab of royal jelly.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.171
Mimosa pollen.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.287
Smurfette.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.601
- Smurfette!
- Yes, good girl.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.763
I can hear them, but I can't see them.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.968
Wait! I know.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.087
Papa, look.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.730
- And a drop of mink oil.
- I knew it.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.087
Is she giving him the formula?

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.571
- Oh, no.
- Smurfette.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.687
Help me get this open.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.811
And you must say one loving truth.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.169
- Of course.
- There.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.442
That's the formula Papa used.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.170
Now, feed them! Please!

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.720
First, we'll see if this works, huh?

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.566
Hurry!

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.767
- Come on.
- Here we are.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.205
Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.490
Pull, Patrick. Put your back into it.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.166
- Come on!
- Hey, there's an opening down here.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.931
- Come on, Positive.
- Yeah, let's shut 'em down.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.607
One loving truth.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.364
I hope this works.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.526
Hackus.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.767
- Smurfette. Thank you.
- Vexy!

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.083
Oh, my Smurf, it worked.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.605
- Hackus!
- Hackus blue!

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.603
Hackus.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.449
Hackus is blue!

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.006
We're blue! We're Smurfs!

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.361
It worked. All the world is mine!

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.445
- I can make my own Smurfs!
- No!

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.605
We've been betrayed.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.327
Finally, finally.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.289
You're a real boy.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.441
I'm blue.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.443
Now into the machine with all of you.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.687
Father, no.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.611
- No cage for Hackus. No cage for Hackus.
- All right, all right.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.129
- In you go.
- No cage for Hackus!

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.282
- Everybody gets their own room.
- Please!

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.769
- I failed her, Vanity.
- Papa, wait.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.329
I think I can reach that pin.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.925
Good idea, Vanity.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.411
Come on, come on.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.691
Father, please.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.250
Now, don't go anywhere.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.809
You face leaking.

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:37.322
Hackus leaking.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.251
Hackus leaking.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.121
You sacrificed everything just to save us.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.170
I had to.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.926
I care about you.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.525
We're family.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.927
No like leaking.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.764
Hackus like blue.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.082
What a sickening scene.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.845
I'd be completely nauseated if this weren't

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.930
the happiest moment of my life!

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.120
- Try the lever, the big one.
- Get on my shoulders.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.845
Hurry, lads.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:11.967
Which way do I go?

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.963
Try negative. That might shut it off.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.884
Negative? Nah. I'm all about positive.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.247
There.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:25.291
One small step for a wizard,

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.364
one giant leap for... What?

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.681
Positive!

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.328
Too much smurf berry cobbler.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.601
Grouchy!

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.804
Yes, I said you could press the button,
didn't I?

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.129
Grouchy!

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.362
I lied. One giant leap for me!

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.770
Just got fried.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.207
Hard to put a positive spin on that.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.561
Son of a Smurf!

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.721
Hurry, Vanity.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:04.088
Narcissism is about to save the day.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.686
- Got it!
- Smurftastic work.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.040
- I knew it.
- Now go.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.565
- What?
- Go!

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.960
Come, Azrael!

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.329
Apparently, we must harness
the power of the skies one final time.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.845
<i>Why does this have</i> to <i>be so Les Misérables?</i>

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.446
- Let's go.
- Look at me, all rough-and-tumble.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.488
I'm like Commando Smurf.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.800
Hooah!

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.366
You are right.
Commandos are quiet and stealthy.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.965
Hooah!

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:28.530
- There she is!
- Smurfette.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.840
Santa!

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.329
Papa? You... You came for me.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.723
Well, of course we came for you.
You're my daughter.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.609
Was there ever a question?

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.404
- No, it's locked.
- Go on through.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.681
- We'll find another way.
- Okay.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.240
We'll see you in there, Master Winslow.
Hurry!

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.926
Here.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.891
Hold this!

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.886
Papa.

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.122
Oh, my dear.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.486
Papa, I gave Gargamel the formula.

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.250
But she saved our lives.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.846
Hackus live! Hackus live!

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.810
Papa, I let you down.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.086
I betrayed the Smurfs.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.650
I'm so sorry.

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:33.721
Smurfette, life is the most precious thing
to protect.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.928
I'm very proud of you.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.968
You... You are?

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.050
Seriously? No spanking?
No smack to the knuckles?

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:43.168
You forgive her, just like that?

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:46.768
Of course.
We rise to the amount of love we're shown,

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.128
and we sink only when that love stops.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.886
Hackus leaking again. Leaking again!

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.691
Hey, you found Smurfette!

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.566
Hello.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.647
Hi.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.840
Oh, no, we don't have much time.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.248
Let's just get the formula back
and get out of here. Hooah!

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.930
Wait! What about them?

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.088
What about them? They kidnapped you.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.446
Yeah, they're Gargamel's.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:16.082
So was I, but Papa never gave up on me.

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:18.527
So I'm not about to give up on them.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.481
And you thought you weren't a real Smurf.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.370
- Get them out, quickly.
- Right, Papa.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:26.044
Free Hackus!

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.646
And then there were seven, eh?

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:31.171
Hello, kitty.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.886
Welcome to the party, Papa!

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.846
Look at all this essence.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:43.649
I love your work. Really, all of you.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.564
In particular, your Blue Period.

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.084
My whole body is scrunching!

01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.487
That's enough, Gargamel.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.005
You have enough.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.847
Yes, yes, but you see, Papa,
I want more than enough!

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.087
After all, I have to be able to power this!

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.163
I call her La Wanda.

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.564
You get it? Because it's a wand.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.449
So I called it La... It's very funny.

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.366
If you weren't in excruciating pain,
you'd be laughing hysterically, believe me.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.486
Whatever will I do with all of this power?

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.601
That's right.

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:34.048
I'm going to rule the entire world!

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.611
No.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.526
And, Papa,

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.490
I want you to know
that as my first official act,

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:47.330
I'm going to create a portal all the way from
Smurf Village right here to my Smurfalator,

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.769
so you get to be
with all of your little smurf y friends.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.364
Forever!

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.606
I don't think so, Gargamel.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.841
Hit it again.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.121
- Give it to me.
- Hurry.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.243
Hurry, he's going for his wand.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.930
- Just break it already!
- I'm too beautiful to die!

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.844
For the love of Smurf, use the pointy end!

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.127
Don't just stand there yelling at me!
Attack!

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.367
Yes!

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:23.086
Oh, no.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.326
Alaka...

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.804
Hackus real boy.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.362
Thrown to the curb again.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.209
Careful, Clumsy!

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.009
- Every time!
- Sorry.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.207
Really?

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.486
High fours!

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.526
Is everyone all right?

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.768
All smurf y and accounted for.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.122
- Patrick!
- Daddy!

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.770
- Hey.
- Hey, Grace!

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.251
Hey-

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.481
We did it!

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.130
Grace!

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.281
Smurfette.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.566
I've missed you.

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.084
I was so worried about you.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.323
Grace, this is Vexy, my other sister.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.801
Well, I guess that makes
you my sister, too.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.085
Are you okay?

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.881
Is this what happy feels like?

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.001
Hello, pretty lady! I'm pretty, too!

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.651
And this is Hackus, my brother.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.767
Hackus!

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.769
Hackus, this is Grace and Patrick.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.481
- Hello!
- And... Your baby?

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.926
This is Blue.

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.010
You did good, Grace.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.889
He's blue-tiful.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.010
Who this? Who this?

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.570
That's Victor.

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.801
He's...

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.921
He's my dad.

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.760
And Blue's pretty fantastic grandpa.

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.284
Daddy and Vicster!

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.521
Okay. I got it.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.400
I'm really proud of you, Patrick Winslow.

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.721
Hyphen-Doyle.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.891
Hyphen-Smurf.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.160
Yeah, guys! Smurf pound.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.766
- Vanity?
- Great job! Great job!

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.600
- Positive?
- Hey, get that thing out of here!

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.926
I'm not pounding anything!

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:05.362
I'm Grouchy,
and I got a lot of pent-up anger to vent!

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.609
Wow, that feels good.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.886
I'm back!

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:10.964
And so am I!

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.561
Perfect.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.364
I think most of you know La Wanda...

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.762
- Unfortunately.
- ...which is a hilarious play on words.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.606
- Smurfette.
- Say hello to my enormous friend!

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.281
I don't think so, Gargamel!

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.846
Yeah!

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.646
Wanda! No, La Wanda, no!

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.530
Where is the "off" button on this thing?

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:46.841
No, no, no, no.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.726
No...

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.168
No, La Wanda! No means no!

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.520
This is really, really gonna hurt.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.811
- Bravo, Smurfette! Bravo!
- Good job, Smurfette!

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.325
That was amazing!

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.243
Well, that takes care of Gargamel.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.165
Let's go home, everybody!

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.366
- Yeah!
- Home!

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.011
We still have one small problem.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.844
I've only got five crystals.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.561
Well, I say no Smurf left behind.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.721
<i>Wow, Smuriette.</i>

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:45.246
You are pretty good with that wand.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.684
It's kind of in my blood.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.762
Which used to concern me.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.761
But as someone wonderful once told me,

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:55.161
it doesn't matter where you came from.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.080
What matters is who you choose to be.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.202
That's my girl.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.442
And you're our papa.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.523
Thanks for giving us a new home.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.967
And a new family.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.565
You're a good Smurf, Papa.

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.961
You'll be a good one, too.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.611
I'm gonna miss you, Smurfs.

01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.320
Maybe you can name a corn dog after them.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.006
Now you're talking. We could use blue corn.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.690
Smurf dogs, yum!

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.441
Yes!

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.885
Well, safe travels, guys.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.362
And smurf back soon.

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.522
Thank you once again, Master Winslow.

01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.726
Miss Doolittle.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.200
Little Blue.

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:36.971
Papa Vicster.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.443
- Goodbye, Winslow family.
- Goodbye, Papa.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.204
- Bye-bye!
- Toodles!

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.090
- Well, let's go, Smurfs.
- Bye-bye, Winslows.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.687
I can't wait to see the rest of my family.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.642
Bye, Smurfs!

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.970
- Hey, personal space.
- Sorry.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.411
Papa, you got Smurfette!

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.040
Welcome home, Smurfette!

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.680
- Well, looky here!
- Yeah, we're back!

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.603
- Hi, guys!
- This is good.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:15.842
And some new Smurfs for our family.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:17.888
Everyone, this is Vexy.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.725
- Great goobaloo!
- She's a sassy lassie.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.847
Hi.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.604
- Hi...
- Hi, I'm Greedy.

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.763
Hi, I'm Greedy. You want
to share a cupcake?

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.610
- Crikey!
- What the hey?

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:32.886
I nearly smurfed myself.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.361
Hackus.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.522
Hackus, these are your new brothers.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.690
I have new brothers!

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.565
Squeeze!

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:41.971
Hold on a minute.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.280
Technically speaking,

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.125
according to section six of the
Smurf Code of Genealogical Legitimacy...

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.770
Hey. Just give him a punt.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.729
- This creature cannot...
- Hackus punt!

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.924
- Yeah!
- That kid's got style.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.047
He's one of us.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.046
And so, after waiting patiently
to be relevant again,

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:02.409
our heroic Narrator
steps back into his leading role

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.284
to point out that when last we met,

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.409
the entire village was busying itself
with preparations for...

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.323
Hey, what's with all the decorations?

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.847
Happy birthday, Smurfette!

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.924
Do you mind? I'm trying to bookend this.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.162
- And so...
- Yo, let's kick it.

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:22.848
As the music unceremoniously
drowns out the narration...

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.964
This is for my new family.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.647
Yeah!

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.682
Hey, Hackus, I got you a present.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:12.125
Yummy!

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:24.090
Yeah!

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.406
Hooah!

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.165
Have a nice trip!

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.849
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! Stop, stop!

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:05.410
Help me, Wanda! Help, help me, Wanda!

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.891
And where do you think you're going?
You are coming with me!

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:23.209
How dare you call me that?
I have bungled nothing!

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.728
Well, Paris is over, my friend.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.326
We're back here in the Dark Ages.
I suggest you get used to it.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.370
You want room service?
Why don't you yell out the window?

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:40.444
Don't you show your claws to me unless you
are prepared to use them, Mr. Pussy Foot!

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.888
Pussy foot! Pussy foot! Pussy foot!

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.367
Stop it! Not the face! Not the face!
