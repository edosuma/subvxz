02:09.363 --> 02:12.766
TOMAS: Now, Peter-- he never
misses a chance to show off.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.003
He sees Jesus
walking across the water

02:16.036 --> 02:18.939
and he says,
"You know something,

02:18.972 --> 02:20.608
I bet I can do that."

02:20.641 --> 02:22.109
And so Jesus tells him,

02:22.142 --> 02:25.045
"Get out of the boat,
start walking."

02:25.078 --> 02:26.314
(microphone feedback hums)

02:26.347 --> 02:27.615
Sorry, guys.
Uh, can you hear me?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.983
Is this thing working?
Can you hear me, guys?

02:30.017 --> 02:31.485
(feedback squeals)

02:31.519 --> 02:33.387
No? Okay.

02:33.421 --> 02:34.822
(clears throat)

02:34.855 --> 02:37.891
So... Peter starts

02:37.925 --> 02:40.027
walking across the water,
he's having a great time,

02:40.060 --> 02:41.662
waving to everyone. (chuckles)

02:41.695 --> 02:43.831
Except, again, this is Peter
we're talking about.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.999
And what does he do?

02:47.401 --> 02:49.903
He looks down.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.272
What do you think happens next?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.508
(people chuckling)

02:54.542 --> 02:56.244
That's right, Luis.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.812
He drops like a rock.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.147
Just like that.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.016
And then Jesus
grabs his arm,

03:03.050 --> 03:05.586
tosses him back into the boat
and he says,

03:05.619 --> 03:08.589
"What's wrong with you?

03:08.622 --> 03:12.293
"I said you could walk on water.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.465
Why didn't you believe me?"

03:19.467 --> 03:23.003
It's okay to have doubt.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.938
It's okay to have questions.

03:24.972 --> 03:30.077
God wants you to
find your own way.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.213
But sometimes,
every now and then,

03:33.247 --> 03:36.417
God gives you a job to do.

03:36.450 --> 03:41.054
And when that happens,
you have to drop everything

03:41.088 --> 03:43.424
and just start walking.

03:43.457 --> 03:47.428
*

03:49.162 --> 03:51.064
(sighs)

03:53.801 --> 03:56.236
Thank you for coming.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.211
Thank you.
Hey, Casey.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.046
How's your sister doing?
She's back home, right?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.816
Yeah. Uh, she just
got her cast off last week.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.318
She's a lot of fun. (chuckles)

04:10.351 --> 04:12.152
Tell her not to be a stranger.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.587
Okay.
Bye.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.022
Bye, Henry.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.692
Oh, yeah.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.137
Father, that was
a lovely service.

04:30.170 --> 04:31.639
Oh.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.341
Casey, he doesn't
have his hat on.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.943
Um, we want you
to have this.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.645
This is for you.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.313
Oh...
For the restoration.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.181
Angela, this is...
No, no, no.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.816
It means a lot
to have somewhere to come

04:42.850 --> 04:44.585
that he's very familiar with.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.687
TOMAS:
How's he doing?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.021
Uh, good days and bad.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.323
You want to talk

04:49.357 --> 04:52.426
sometime,
my door is always open.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.894
Thank you.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.238

05:16.049 --> 05:18.051
CASEY:
Dad.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.843
Kat? We got doughnuts.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.416

05:53.186 --> 05:55.523
Kat?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.324
(quiet rumbling)

05:57.357 --> 05:58.559
(thump, rumbling stops)

05:58.592 --> 06:00.093
KAT:
I'm not hungry.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.501

plates tinkling)

OLIVIA: Sorry.
TOMAS: Hey, sis.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.690
OLIVIA:
Inventory took forever.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.091
(door closes)

06:31.124 --> 06:33.360

OLIVIA:
Ugh!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.362
Hey, Luis.
(sighs)

06:35.395 --> 06:37.197
Buddy.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.532
Hey.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.033
Luis.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.401
Your mom's here.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.437
(chuckles)

06:43.471 --> 06:45.806
Um...

06:45.839 --> 06:47.575
do you want to tell me

06:47.608 --> 06:49.042
what this is about?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.611
That's...

06:50.644 --> 06:52.245
private stuff.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.214
Since when do you have
Jessica writing you letters?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.749
Why are you even talking to her?

06:55.783 --> 06:56.917
She's my friend.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.652
She's married.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.588
Married people
can't have friends?

07:00.621 --> 07:03.156
Do you know who writes letters?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.158
People who don't
want to get caught.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.060
Olivia, there's nothing
to catch, okay?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.428
Nothing to catch.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.464
That's what you said
the first time.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.666
Tomas, if you don't
want to be a priest,

07:12.700 --> 07:14.301
then don't be a priest,

07:14.334 --> 07:16.303
but you can't
keep doing this.
(speaks Spanish)

07:16.336 --> 07:18.405
Who said I don't
want to be a priest?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.339
LUIS:
Mom?

07:19.372 --> 07:22.409
Hey, baby.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.645
Did you have fun?

07:24.678 --> 07:25.979
Yeah? Come on.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.515
Oh, you have your shoes on.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.017
Listen, I'm just saying,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.952
Abuelita isn't here anymore.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.420
There is no shame

07:33.453 --> 07:35.589
in saying,
"Hey, I gave it a shot."

07:35.623 --> 07:37.925
Hey, I'm not
giving anything a shot, okay?

07:37.958 --> 07:41.094
I love my job,
I'm good at my job.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.297
There's nothing
going on with Jessica.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.333
Promise?

07:46.366 --> 07:49.770
Yeah, I swear on this...
greasy, amazing pizza

07:49.803 --> 07:51.605
that you're gonna
have right now.
I don't want any...

07:51.639 --> 07:53.040
(Olivia and Tomas laugh)

07:53.073 --> 07:54.441
You're an idiot.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.443
Okay. What do you say
to Uncle Tomas?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.546
Thanks.
See you, buddy. Huh?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.581
Bye.
Thank you.

from side to side *

* Are you ready...

09:08.916 --> 09:11.351
(music stops)
Father Marcus.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.687
You're a long way from Rome.
Oh, I'm glad
you noticed,

09:13.721 --> 09:15.355
considering it's your fault.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.691
No one's heard from you
in 26 days.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.126
I'm aware.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.428
Are you also aware
the church has places

09:21.461 --> 09:23.797
for those who would
disobey a direct order?

09:25.098 --> 09:27.034
You putting me
out to pasture, Bennett?

09:27.067 --> 09:30.537
If my hand is forced,
without hesitation.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.906
This cannot continue, Marcus.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.307
These people are scared.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.276
Scared?

09:36.309 --> 09:39.112
You forgotten Haiti?

09:39.146 --> 09:42.582
How they tied a bed sheet
around that girl's neck?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.551
Hung her from the branches
of a mango tree...

09:44.584 --> 09:46.119
I remember Haiti.
...while we did nothing.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.155
I trust you've
made progress.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.723
Every day is progress.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.558
The power's in the repetition.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.027
That's very poetic, Marcus.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.766
(baby crying, TV commentator
speaking Spanish)

10:02.936 --> 10:04.938
(boy panting raggedly)

10:14.648 --> 10:16.650
(boy growls)

10:20.020 --> 10:22.589
What have you done?
My job.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.158
Your job?
That child is going to die.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.760
He's a strong boy.
I can bring him back.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.662
This is so far beyond protocol.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.030
Your protocol. Not mine.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.032
This ends now!

10:32.065 --> 10:33.934
I'm taking that boy
to a hospital.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.536
Bennett.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.475
You would shoot me?

10:42.509 --> 10:43.844
Without hesitation.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.613
That boy
needs my help.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.816
I won't abandon him.

10:48.849 --> 10:52.552
Rome will not
forgive this, Marcus.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.988
It's not their forgiveness
I seek.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.426
(fan rattling quietly,
crow cawing)

Â¿Quieres que te lo cuente
otra vez?

11:58.651 --> 12:00.620
Gabriel, Gabriel, come back
to me. Come back to me.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.955

12:01.989 --> 12:03.590
Come back.
Tienes que luchar.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.961
God has not abandoned you.

Marcus!

12:13.834 --> 12:15.235
What is this place?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.274
(screams)
Freely will I offer you
sacrifice.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.745
Every unclean spirit,
every satanic power,

12:25.779 --> 12:28.281
every onslaught of
the infernal adversary.
Hello?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.752
We command you, be gone...
(demonic roar)

12:32.786 --> 12:34.221
Can-can you hear me?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.823
...and fly far
from the Church of God.

12:35.856 --> 12:36.890

Okay, book Expo.

The Palmer is gonna try and grab

13:09.556 --> 13:11.124
the late bookings,
so we need to...
FRED: The Palmer?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.926
When do we worry
about the Palmer? Angela?

13:12.960 --> 13:15.762
Yes?
FRED:
Go be with your family.

Angela.
Fine.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.934
Go. Go.

Okay.

REPORTER: The decision comes
after years of pressure

13:37.918 --> 13:39.319
from banks, which view

13:39.352 --> 13:41.188
the elevated capital
requirements as onerous.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.791
Now, opponents of the higher

14:12.185 --> 14:13.820
How was practice?

14:13.853 --> 14:17.357
Practice was fine. (chuckles)

Good.

Oh, what's that smell?

Is that you?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.182
What do you want?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.683
I just...

14:43.716 --> 14:46.219
just caught Mom crying, so...

14:46.253 --> 14:48.288
That wasn't weird.
Mm.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.690
I'm sure that
was an accident.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.891
You're so mean to her.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.126
She only climbs
up on her cross

14:53.160 --> 14:54.361
when she wants
some attention.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.895
Who does that sound like?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.568
Hey, we're... we're playing
DePaul on Friday,

15:01.601 --> 15:03.203
if you wanted to, you know,

15:03.236 --> 15:05.138
someday possibly
leave this room.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.473
Pass.

15:06.506 --> 15:07.975
There will be
guys there.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.709
Hard pass.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.144
You do realize this

15:11.178 --> 15:12.812
pity party thing
stops being cute

15:12.845 --> 15:14.982
when you're, like... 14?

15:15.015 --> 15:16.583
Why do you care?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.585
Because you're my stupid sister.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.653
Also, for real,
I'm really hungry.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.755
Go eat without me.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.595
That's... that's one option.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.831
Or...

15:31.864 --> 15:34.567
(chuckles)
Is that the tickle monster?
Don't. Casey.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.270
'Cause he's coming to...
Stop it. Don't do it.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.905
He just wants to say hi.
Get... Don't...

15:38.938 --> 15:41.174
Oh, my God, it's a smile.
She's smiling.
Stop it. Stop it.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.642
She remembers how to smile.
I'm not kidding.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.810
She's laughing.
I'm serious.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.145
I'm gonna tell Mom
you're laughing.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.014
I'm not laughing.
(giggles) Yeah, you are.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.448
(laughing): Stop it.
(laughing)

15:48.481 --> 15:50.517
(organ playing upbeat tune,
tools whirring)

15:54.321 --> 15:56.723
(tools continue whirring,
organ playing)

16:01.461 --> 16:04.264
(loud wooden clacking)

16:04.297 --> 16:06.499
(organ beeps, music stops)

16:06.533 --> 16:08.968
It froze

16:09.002 --> 16:11.938
up again!
I'm on it, Mrs. Finley!
I'm on it.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.475
I told you I can't
work this thing!

16:15.508 --> 16:18.678
Tara, have you seen the
instruction book for the organ?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.180
I think
Mrs. Finley has it.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.515
(metallic clank,
Tomas sighs)

16:23.083 --> 16:24.451
(beep)

16:24.484 --> 16:26.553
It says "E-R-R"!

16:26.586 --> 16:28.488
I'm coming, Mrs.
Finley. I'm coming.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.522
Ay.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.963
(loud clacking)

16:36.996 --> 16:38.398
MAN:
Sorry.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.411
(door creaks)

16:54.347 --> 16:56.349
*

17:11.931 --> 17:13.933
(sighs softly)

17:18.371 --> 17:20.907
(electrical hissing)
Oh!

17:20.940 --> 17:23.910
(quiet thumping)

17:23.943 --> 17:26.279
(pipes rattling softly)

17:26.313 --> 17:28.315
(quiet thumping continues)

17:32.319 --> 17:34.921
(sighs)

17:34.954 --> 17:36.623
(loud clack,
electricity whirring)

17:36.656 --> 17:38.691
Oh.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.693
(both gasp)

17:40.727 --> 17:42.529
I'm so sorry, Father.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.131
It's fine.
They said you were down here.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.798
No, it's fine, it's fine.
You just, uh...

17:45.832 --> 17:47.800
(sighs)
It's fine.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.869
(both sigh)

17:49.902 --> 17:52.372
Could I, uh...
could I speak with you?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.907
Yes.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.544
ANGELA:
So...

17:57.577 --> 18:00.580
you're gonna think I'm, uh...

18:00.613 --> 18:03.783
Um, what's troubling you,
Angela?

18:03.816 --> 18:06.653
(clears throat)
Okay.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.789
My daughter, Katherine.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.791
She's back from college.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.126
She took a leave.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.328
Car accident. Uh, someone died.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.165
Yeah. Her, um, friend.

18:18.198 --> 18:23.170
And... ever since she got back
from the hospital,

18:23.203 --> 18:25.472
she's different.

18:25.505 --> 18:29.008
The way she talks,
the way she looks at me.

18:29.041 --> 18:31.778
Well, she lost a
friend. It's normal.
It's... it's not depression.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.214
I know depression.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.319
There are things going on
in the house.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.053
My house.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.124
I come down in the morning,

18:45.158 --> 18:48.428
and all of the chairs have been
moved away from the table.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.531
Or the bookshelves.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.700
All of the books
are on the floor.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.303
Well, maybe Henry's...
It's not Henry.

18:57.870 --> 19:02.074
There are voices
inside the walls.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.613
Well, you know,
I have this fan back home.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.681
And sometimes,
in the middle of the night,

19:08.715 --> 19:10.617
starts to make
this strange sound.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.952
Like, uh, chaka, chaka,
chaka, chaka, chaka...

19:12.985 --> 19:15.788
There is something
inside my house.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.724
Angela, I'm...

19:17.757 --> 19:19.726
And I know how this sounds,

19:19.759 --> 19:22.895
but I have
400 employees under me.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.464
I'm not a crazy person.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.865
No, I'm-I'm not saying

19:25.898 --> 19:27.166
you're crazy. I'm...

19:27.200 --> 19:28.668
It's a demon.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.308
A demon?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.277
And it's trying
to take my daughter.

19:41.214 --> 19:45.385
Angela, demons, um, aren't real.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.886
They are an invention

19:46.919 --> 19:50.757
of the Church to
explain things like, um,

19:50.790 --> 19:53.226
addiction,

19:53.260 --> 19:55.528
mental illness.

19:55.562 --> 20:00.199
They were not monsters
or creatures.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.001
Demons are...

20:02.034 --> 20:04.203
metaphors.

20:04.237 --> 20:08.341
Do you think I don't know that?

20:08.375 --> 20:11.578
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

20:11.611 --> 20:15.081
to sit here and sound like this?

20:15.114 --> 20:20.287
But I am telling you,
something is going on.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.524
There is a presence,
and I feel it.

20:24.557 --> 20:29.095
I'm not even trying
to convince you to believe me.

20:29.128 --> 20:32.732
Just come to the house.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.067
Just talk to her.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.636
Will you?

20:36.669 --> 20:38.070
(sighs)

20:38.104 --> 20:39.506
Yes.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.376
(screams)
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!
(raven screeching)

20:43.410 --> 20:47.046
Oh! Oh, my God!

20:47.079 --> 20:49.982
Oh!
Oh!
(screeching)

20:50.016 --> 20:51.984
(panting)

20:58.691 --> 21:01.127
(train chugging on tracks)

21:05.798 --> 21:09.369
*

21:21.881 --> 21:24.283
(train brakes squealing)

21:26.686 --> 21:28.955
(doors hiss open)

21:36.663 --> 21:39.332
KAT: Clearly,
my mom put you up to this.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.267
You can just go ahead
and tell her I'm fine.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.804
I'm wildly aware of the fact
that everyone thinks

21:44.837 --> 21:48.207
I'm this fragile little
ornament, but I'm fine.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.709
I'm dealing.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.143
And how are you sleeping?

21:51.177 --> 21:52.445
What?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.647
Any bad dreams?

21:54.681 --> 21:56.282
I don't dream.
Not ever?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.017
No. What is this about?

22:00.353 --> 22:02.355
(sighs)

22:04.357 --> 22:07.727
Your mother believes that your
house has been visited by, um...

22:07.760 --> 22:09.662
a presence.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.163
A demon.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.767
(laughing)

22:18.905 --> 22:22.174
Oh, my God. (exhales)

22:22.208 --> 22:24.711
That's hysterical.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.345
(exhales)

22:26.379 --> 22:28.381
You know

22:28.415 --> 22:30.383
what's going on here, right?

22:33.953 --> 22:38.391
I liked my friend's stupid
Wiccan craft store on Facebook.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.026
So now she thinks I'm out

22:40.059 --> 22:41.728
drinking ram's blood
or something.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.997
Do you know
how embarrassing that is?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.599
She's very worried
about you, too.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.034
She's losing her mind.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.036
You've seen my dad
and what he's like?

22:50.069 --> 22:51.504
Yes.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.373
Last Christmas,

22:54.407 --> 22:56.909
they were taking ballroom
dancing classes together.

22:56.943 --> 22:59.679
Now she's got to check his ass

22:59.712 --> 23:03.182
every time
he goes to the bathroom.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.417
(sighs)

23:04.451 --> 23:06.018
Her whole life blew up,

23:06.052 --> 23:09.556
and she's looking
for somebody to blame.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.123
Besides God.

23:11.157 --> 23:14.694
Is that who you blame
when things go wrong?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.696
No.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.566
I blame myself.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.602
Because that's what you do
when you're an adult.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.310
Angela, thank you
very, very much.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.412
Thank you. This
is... It's great.

23:33.446 --> 23:35.882
No, it's just
boring old meatloaf.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.618
Haven't made a meal in months.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.552
It's really good, Mom.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.387
ANGELA:
Well, I kind of burnt

23:41.420 --> 23:42.755
the edges. Rusty.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.924
I like burnt edges.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.926
A little gristle for the gums.

23:46.959 --> 23:50.296
How's the boat, Henry?

23:54.333 --> 23:56.603
How's that?

23:57.837 --> 24:00.940
The boat--
did you fix it up?

24:04.544 --> 24:06.145
He's talking about your boat,
Henry.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.514
You're wasting your time.

24:07.547 --> 24:09.448
He's basically a potato.
Kat!

24:11.951 --> 24:13.653
Should we get dessert?

24:13.686 --> 24:15.421
Katherine, what is
wrong with you?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.423
That's your father.
Really?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.458
Does that look
like Dad to you?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.427
Dad? Dad?!

24:21.460 --> 24:23.195
Hello? Dad?
Katherine!

24:33.906 --> 24:36.876
TOMAS:
You know, I had

24:36.909 --> 24:38.444
an advisor back in seminary.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.548
He was... called in
to give the last rites...

24:41.581 --> 24:42.882
(clears throat)

24:42.915 --> 24:45.317
...to a young woman in a coma.

24:45.351 --> 24:48.020
She was brain-dead.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.956
No hope of recovery.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.826
So, he goes there,
he does his thing,

24:53.860 --> 24:56.829
but the next day, she wakes up.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.364
It was a miracle.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.366
That's wonderful.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.468
But here's the thing.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.203
That woman

25:04.236 --> 25:07.006
could remember conversations
that took place inside her room

25:07.039 --> 25:10.009
while she was in her coma,
which suggests-- I don't know--

25:10.042 --> 25:14.013
to me, anyway, that even when
the rest of the body shuts down,

25:14.046 --> 25:17.684
there is some part of the brain
that stays aware,

25:17.717 --> 25:19.552
knows everything
that's going on.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.257
So keep your damn hands
out of his face.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.437
(door slams)

25:38.470 --> 25:40.106
(man laughs over TV)

25:40.139 --> 25:41.708
MAN:
Nice tarpon, Austin!

25:41.741 --> 25:44.076
MAN 2: Yeah.
MAN 3: Good job.
MAN: Sweet!

25:44.110 --> 25:45.912
AUSTIN:
I don't want to let go!

25:45.945 --> 25:47.413
MAN 2:
It's done.

25:47.446 --> 25:48.881
Hey, Henry,

25:48.915 --> 25:51.417
I am taking off.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.586
Hey, thanks for coming.
Oh, it's...

25:53.620 --> 25:56.455
And thanks for talking to Kat.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.391
I know Angela's been...

25:59.425 --> 26:00.793
Yeah.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.461
It's been a rough
couple of months.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.964
She's a good kid.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.800
Yeah. She is.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.802
Thank you.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.938
(footsteps departing)

26:11.971 --> 26:14.173
It's just off 41.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.045
What's off 41?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.148
St. Aquinas.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.549
(chuckles)

26:23.582 --> 26:25.818
What's at St. Aquinas?

26:25.852 --> 26:27.820
Father Marcus.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.330
Father Marcus?

26:41.000 --> 26:43.002
Henry...

26:46.205 --> 26:48.207
...who is Father Marcus?

26:53.646 --> 26:56.315
Hey, thanks for coming.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.350
And thanks for talking to Kat.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.321
(train brakes squeal)

27:02.354 --> 27:05.792
*

27:21.240 --> 27:23.509
*

27:48.534 --> 27:50.536
(dogs barking in distance)

27:55.708 --> 27:57.710
(demonic voice):
Marcus!

27:59.712 --> 28:01.848
(hissing, growling)

28:04.583 --> 28:06.819
(Marcus praying urgently)

28:06.853 --> 28:08.855
Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who...

28:08.888 --> 28:09.989
(demonic voice):
Marcus.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.157
(Liverpool accent):
Marky-boy.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.092
Where are you, lad?

28:13.125 --> 28:15.327
I command you, unclean spirit,

28:15.361 --> 28:18.264
along with all your minions now
attacking this servant of God,

28:18.297 --> 28:20.767
by the mysteries
of the incarnation, the passion,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.368
the resurrection
and the ascension

28:22.401 --> 28:23.936
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

28:23.970 --> 28:25.938
by the coming of our Lord
for judgment,

28:25.972 --> 28:29.541
that you tell me
by some sign your name,

28:29.575 --> 28:31.577
and the day
and hour of your departure!

28:31.610 --> 28:32.779
(demonic voice):
I am the Baptist.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.546
The hour of your departure!

28:34.580 --> 28:35.748
BOY:
I am the Baptist.

28:35.782 --> 28:38.751
The hour of your departure.
Baptist!

28:38.785 --> 28:41.287
(thudding and rattling)

28:43.722 --> 28:45.091
(quiet snarl)

28:45.124 --> 28:49.095
(demonic voice):
Not... long... now.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.099
(Marcus panting, boy wheezing)

28:58.604 --> 29:00.873
And Jesus said...

29:00.907 --> 29:02.541
"Come to me,

29:02.574 --> 29:04.877
all you who are
weary and burdened..."

29:04.911 --> 29:05.978
(coughs)

29:06.012 --> 29:08.247
"...and I will give you rest."

29:08.280 --> 29:09.615
(coughing)

29:09.648 --> 29:11.250
(deep, croaking laugh)

29:11.283 --> 29:13.986
(metal rattling)

29:14.020 --> 29:16.388
(growling)

29:16.422 --> 29:18.624
(whispers):
Gabriel.

29:18.657 --> 29:21.593
Gabriel!
(demonic groaning)

29:21.627 --> 29:24.496
(growls)
(groaning)

29:24.530 --> 29:26.765
(demonic voice):
Look upon me, Marcus!

29:26.799 --> 29:29.001
(bones crack)

29:29.035 --> 29:32.438
(groaning)

29:32.471 --> 29:35.307
Oh. No.

29:35.341 --> 29:36.675
No, no, no. Please, God.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.077
Please, God.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.312
(groaning, bones cracking)

29:40.346 --> 29:41.914
(neck snaps)
Oh, God.

29:41.948 --> 29:42.949
No!

29:48.988 --> 29:50.990
(sobbing)

29:56.695 --> 29:59.498
(sobbing loudly)

30:28.895 --> 30:31.263
*

30:54.887 --> 30:57.256
*

31:08.534 --> 31:11.437
(church bells tolling)

31:11.470 --> 31:14.006
MAN:
You look lost, son.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.042
(crow cawing in distance)

31:16.075 --> 31:17.376
Hi.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.778
Uh, are you
talking to me?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.314
(chuckles):
Yeah. Got a name?

31:24.816 --> 31:26.585
That would be your hand.

31:26.618 --> 31:27.753
Oh.
(chuckles)

31:27.786 --> 31:29.355
Sorry.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.690
Well, that's all right.
Um...

31:31.723 --> 31:33.425
Tomas.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.094
Father Tomas.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.128
From St. Anthony's.

31:36.162 --> 31:38.564
How do you know that?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.032
Who do you think sends you

31:40.066 --> 31:41.867
all those wonderful
fund-raising letters

31:41.900 --> 31:43.869
you throw
straight into the trash?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.638
I can tell you the name
of every priest

31:46.672 --> 31:48.941
from here to Massac County.

31:48.975 --> 31:52.711
But you...
oh, I've heard about you.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.813
Father Tomas.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.549
(whispers):
The rising star.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.718
Well, I don't know about that.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.253
Uh, do you happen to know...?

32:01.287 --> 32:02.654
The bishop speaks

32:02.688 --> 32:04.390
very highly of you.

32:04.423 --> 32:08.327
Says you're exactly the sort
of man we need right now.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.895
(speaks Spanish)

32:09.928 --> 32:11.630
(sighs)

32:11.663 --> 32:14.833
So, what brings you

32:14.866 --> 32:16.402
to our humble home?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.803
Hmm?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.972
I'm...

32:20.006 --> 32:21.473
(laughs)

32:21.507 --> 32:23.142
...looking for some answers.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.744
But do you have
the right question?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.079
(laughs)

32:27.113 --> 32:28.414
What's the right question?

32:28.447 --> 32:31.250
"What now, God?

32:31.283 --> 32:35.287
"Give me a purpose,
point me in a direction,

32:35.321 --> 32:38.590
make me
your divine instrument."

32:38.624 --> 32:40.826
Once you ask Him that,
you'll be surprised

32:40.859 --> 32:42.928
how much the old guy has to say.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.697
"What now, God?"

32:45.731 --> 32:47.799
Just like that.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.835
(chuckles)

32:49.868 --> 32:52.338
Hmm.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.805
(crow cawing in distance)

32:56.575 --> 32:57.643
Sorry.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.211
Hmm?

32:59.245 --> 33:01.713
Take care now.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.051
(crow cawing)

33:07.986 --> 33:10.389
*

33:20.166 --> 33:22.568
*

33:24.536 --> 33:29.241
* It was a miracle,
a miracle *

33:29.275 --> 33:33.979
* Heaven created a miracle
and sent me down *

33:34.012 --> 33:39.251
* An angel like you

33:39.285 --> 33:42.554
* When we met, I knew it

33:42.588 --> 33:45.857
* Right from the start

33:45.891 --> 33:51.663
* You were meant for me
and we'd never part *

33:51.697 --> 33:55.101
* It was a miracle,
a miracle... *

33:55.134 --> 33:57.169
Father Marcus?
* Heaven created a...

33:57.203 --> 33:58.504
(music stops)

33:58.537 --> 34:00.506
What do you want?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.908
My name is
Tomas Ortega.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.611
Father Tomas from St. Anthony's.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.379
It's in Chicago.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.915
What do you want?

34:15.887 --> 34:18.657
What can you tell me
about demonic possession?

34:20.459 --> 34:22.228
Doesn't exist.

34:22.261 --> 34:24.096
Enjoy your drive home.

34:24.130 --> 34:27.566
I was told
you were an exorcist.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.601
Who exactly told you that?

34:29.635 --> 34:31.370
Does it matter?

34:31.403 --> 34:34.773
Yeah, I think it does.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.909
It is you.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.545
What do you want?

34:39.578 --> 34:41.813
Exorcism-- does it work?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.616
According to the Church, yeah.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.051
And according to you?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.719
You didn't come here for advice,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.655
did you, Father Tomas
from St. Anthony's in Chicago?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.790
You came for help.

34:51.823 --> 34:53.925
Who is it?

34:53.959 --> 34:56.295
Um, a girl
in my parish.

34:56.328 --> 34:59.097
Maybe.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.099
So why maybe come to me?

35:04.136 --> 35:07.473
I had a dream.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.642
Dreams. And...

35:10.676 --> 35:13.479
It's the same dream...

35:13.512 --> 35:15.113
and you're in it.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.949
Go on.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.087
There was a child...

35:22.120 --> 35:25.157
tied to a bed.

35:25.191 --> 35:27.193
You called him Gabriel.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.930
What else?

35:31.963 --> 35:35.167
There was newspapers
in the window,

35:35.201 --> 35:38.170
a... a broken crib
on the floor.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.971
The boy-- he died.
His neck...

35:40.005 --> 35:41.773
Tell me something that
wasn't on the news.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.310
If you were in the room,
what did you see?
I...

35:44.343 --> 35:45.644
I don't believe you.
You-you...

35:45.677 --> 35:46.945
I don't believe you, Tomas.
You, um...

35:46.978 --> 35:48.314
If you were in the room,
what did you see?

35:48.347 --> 35:49.548
You told him
a nursery rhyme.

35:49.581 --> 35:50.916
Go on.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.665
18 months ago.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.268
Mexico City.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.240
It was real?

36:14.273 --> 36:17.175
Oh, yeah.

36:17.209 --> 36:20.212
Now you believe-- let me guess--
that God has brought you here

36:20.246 --> 36:22.381
to my door...
The only thing that I know

36:22.414 --> 36:24.750
is that something, somehow...
That would be a type of

36:24.783 --> 36:26.352
coincidence, Tomas.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.520
God, for future
reference, isn't the one

36:28.554 --> 36:30.489
who works in
mysterious ways.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.491
You're being
manipulated, my friend,

36:32.524 --> 36:36.262
by forces you can't even
begin to understand.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.366
They're gonna love you.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.500
They? Who are they?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.535
It's an excellent question.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.504
(door creaks)

36:45.537 --> 36:47.105
Go home, Father Tomas.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.540
Give your homilies,

36:48.574 --> 36:49.875
break your bread.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.277
Live a long and happy life.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.545
You're way out of your depth.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.218
You're afraid.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.988
Yeah. You should be, too.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.259
And Jesus said,

37:07.293 --> 37:10.262
"Come to me, all you
who are weary and burdened,

37:10.296 --> 37:13.198
and I will give you rest."

37:13.231 --> 37:15.233
(clock ticking)

37:18.169 --> 37:20.171
(door creaks shut)

37:30.416 --> 37:32.784
All this time.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.354
All this time,
and this is what you send me?

37:36.422 --> 37:39.491
This is your damn sign?!

37:48.467 --> 37:50.869
(quiet breathing)

37:54.272 --> 37:59.177
(slow, ragged breathing)

38:04.983 --> 38:06.952
(knocking)

38:06.985 --> 38:09.355
(slow, ragged breathing
continues)

38:10.889 --> 38:12.658
(loud knocking)

38:13.892 --> 38:16.294
(crickets chirping)

38:18.063 --> 38:20.499
Father Tomas.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.534
(sighs)

38:25.036 --> 38:26.972
(sighs)

38:29.908 --> 38:33.278
Do you believe in God, Angela?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.846
Wow.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.148
Get right to the good stuff.

38:40.151 --> 38:44.523
Um... I like the idea of God.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.858
Um, I want to believe

38:46.892 --> 38:50.629
that good things happen
for a reason,

38:50.662 --> 38:53.632
and that we're not just a...

38:53.665 --> 38:57.168
bunch of molecules
smashing into each other.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.870
But... I don't know.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.372
Hmm.

39:00.406 --> 39:03.475
What about you?

39:03.509 --> 39:07.078
Well, if you talk
to other priests...

39:09.615 --> 39:11.417
...they will tell you
they heard God's voice,

39:11.450 --> 39:15.854
His... actual voice,
calling them to serve.

39:15.887 --> 39:19.725
I never had that.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.794
Did you know
I was born in Chicago?

39:24.563 --> 39:26.698
Mm. Right down the street.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.400
I did not know that.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.868
When my

39:29.901 --> 39:33.338
parents separated,
Olivia, my sister--

39:33.371 --> 39:38.043
she stayed here,
and I went to... to Mexico

39:38.076 --> 39:39.745
to live with my grandmother.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.681
She would tell me
all the big plans

39:42.714 --> 39:44.015
she had for me.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.052
She would say...

39:47.085 --> 39:49.588
"You watch, mijo.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.089
"You watch, and someday

39:51.122 --> 39:53.592
you'll become the first
Mexican pope."

39:53.625 --> 39:55.260
(both chuckle)

39:55.293 --> 39:56.795
"Make us all proud." Mm.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.897
Mm.
It always used
to bother me

39:58.930 --> 40:00.566
that I never heard
God's voice.

40:00.599 --> 40:01.967
I would say,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.202
maybe He never wanted me
in the first place.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.237
Maybe...

40:08.740 --> 40:10.776
Maybe I don't belong here.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.218
I think God spoke to me today.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.854
What did He say?

40:24.355 --> 40:27.893
He said...

40:27.926 --> 40:30.161
"I want you
to look at this family."

40:30.195 --> 40:33.264
(gasps softly)

40:33.298 --> 40:36.034
"I want you
to help them, Tomas.

40:40.806 --> 40:42.974
"This is your purpose.

40:45.143 --> 40:47.112
(sniffles)

40:47.145 --> 40:49.147
(sighs)

40:52.784 --> 40:54.986
This is why you're here."

40:55.020 --> 40:56.354
(thump, girl screams)

40:58.223 --> 41:00.291
(thumping)

41:01.359 --> 41:03.294
(loud breathing)

41:03.328 --> 41:05.964
(ragged breathing)

41:05.997 --> 41:07.566
(walls rattling softly)

41:10.569 --> 41:12.571
(ragged breathing,
rattling continues)

41:18.376 --> 41:20.546
(loud thud)
Oh!

41:23.682 --> 41:25.416
Anybody up there?

41:28.186 --> 41:30.155
(loud, ragged breathing)

41:34.560 --> 41:37.696
(high-pitched electrical pop)

41:37.729 --> 41:40.732
(sighs)

41:40.766 --> 41:42.768
(ragged breathing)

41:48.674 --> 41:50.475
Katherine?

41:50.508 --> 41:54.512
(ragged breathing)

41:54.546 --> 41:56.948
(low growling)
What are you doing here?

41:58.216 --> 42:00.085
Katherine?

42:00.118 --> 42:01.486
(thudding, glass clinking)

42:01.519 --> 42:03.321
(inhales sharply)

42:03.354 --> 42:06.625
(groaning)

42:10.929 --> 42:12.664
(loud breathing)

42:12.698 --> 42:14.633
(clattering)

42:19.871 --> 42:22.040
(bottle rolls, clinks)

42:30.582 --> 42:32.784
Oh!

42:32.818 --> 42:34.820
(rat squealing, bones cracking)

42:39.557 --> 42:41.827
(bones snapping)

42:43.662 --> 42:45.631
(rat squeals)

42:45.664 --> 42:48.533
(footsteps running)

42:48.566 --> 42:49.868
(gasps)

42:49.901 --> 42:52.871
(low growling)

42:52.904 --> 42:54.940
Casey?

42:56.307 --> 42:57.809
Casey.

42:57.843 --> 42:59.745
(gasps)

43:04.750 --> 43:05.817
(low grunting)

43:05.851 --> 43:07.485
(grunting)

43:08.620 --> 43:09.755
(growling)

43:09.788 --> 43:11.089
Casey, stop!

43:11.122 --> 43:14.259
(rattling)

43:14.960 --> 43:16.561
(gasping)

43:16.594 --> 43:18.096
Father?

43:18.129 --> 43:20.265
(panting)
Hey, Mom.

43:20.298 --> 43:22.567
What are you doing up here?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.970
Father Tomas killed a rat.

43:25.003 --> 43:27.238
He whacked it
with a book.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.974
How badass is that?

43:29.007 --> 43:31.409
A rat?

43:31.442 --> 43:33.912
We should get some traps.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.313
Yeah.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.917
Don't they say
where there's one, there's...

43:38.950 --> 43:40.952
there's probably
a whole bunch?

43:54.499 --> 43:56.434
(panting)

43:56.467 --> 43:59.337
(dog barking, siren blaring)

43:59.370 --> 44:01.873
(sniffles, sighs)

44:04.475 --> 44:07.746
(The Exorcist theme playing)

44:23.594 --> 44:26.197
