[music playing]

00:03.771 --> 00:06.074
[harmonica music]

00:08.109 --> 00:09.043
Darn.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.778
What's the matter, DJ?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.146
This problem's impossible.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.483
I'm supposed to
multiply 1/4 times 1/7,

00:15.516 --> 00:17.618
and give the answer in base two.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.153
You know, DJ, it's ironic.

00:19.187 --> 00:22.090
You're a kid, you're not
supposed to have any problems.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.591
You go to school, and
they give them to you.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.293
[laughter]

00:27.161 --> 00:29.497
Either help me or be
quiet so I can work.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.265
[laughter]

00:33.634 --> 00:34.968
The answer is three.

00:35.002 --> 00:35.869
[door closing]

00:35.903 --> 00:36.770
Trust me.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.106
[laughter]

00:38.139 --> 00:40.508
OK, you little freak, you're
about to see your heart.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.409
Rosie!

00:41.442 --> 00:42.776
Rosie, a little help here!

00:42.810 --> 00:45.579
Oh, back, back, back, back!

00:45.613 --> 00:47.515
You might think they're
tame, but you gotta

00:47.548 --> 00:48.882
remember they're wild animals.

00:48.916 --> 00:49.983
[laughter]

00:50.017 --> 00:52.553
The evil pinhead
was in my room again.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.654
I locked my door,
but he must have

00:53.687 --> 00:54.755
gotten in through the bathroom.

00:54.788 --> 00:58.058
I didn't do anything.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.993
[laughter]

01:00.027 --> 01:00.994
Cool, it worked.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.863
[laughter]

01:05.399 --> 01:07.235
He put bath oil
beads in my pockets,

01:07.268 --> 01:09.403
so that when I sat
down, they'd break.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.505
I'm walking around in school,
everybody's pointing at my butt

01:11.539 --> 01:12.406
and laughing.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.208
[laughter]

01:14.242 --> 01:15.943
For a moment I knew the
pain of being Becky.

01:15.976 --> 01:17.611
[laughter]

01:19.680 --> 01:22.150
I want him punished
severely for this.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.717
OK, bring me
the cheese grater.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.618
[laughter]

01:24.652 --> 01:25.953
I'm serious, mom.

01:25.986 --> 01:26.854
All right, all right.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.788
We'll ground him.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.989
Grounding him
won't do no good.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.924
All he does is hang
around the house anyway.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.060
Hey, how about a week
with no video games?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.895
Uh, honey, that
would be perfect,

01:34.928 --> 01:38.666
but, uh, I'm on level eight
of Super Froggy Quest, and--

01:38.699 --> 01:39.967
[laughter]

01:40.000 --> 01:41.935
--he's gotta show me where
the magic jewels are.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.804
[laughter]

01:43.837 --> 01:45.673
Those punishments bite.

01:45.706 --> 01:46.907
You guys call
yourselves parents?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.476
You're supposed to
be better at this.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.844
So why don't you punish him?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.580
Really?

01:52.613 --> 01:53.714
What do you think, Dan?

01:53.747 --> 01:54.948
Bye, DJ.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.617
[laughter]

01:56.650 --> 01:59.052
Just remember, you're
at that awkward age

01:59.086 --> 02:00.454
where you could be
tried as an adult.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.055
[laughter]

02:02.089 --> 02:04.057
I got it.

02:04.091 --> 02:06.227
You have to wear a suit
and tie to school tomorrow.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.028
In front of everyone?

02:08.061 --> 02:10.164
Gee, Darlene, why don't you
just beat him up yourself?

02:10.198 --> 02:11.665
[laughter]

02:12.966 --> 02:15.836
I don't like you, don't
like you, don't like you.

02:15.869 --> 02:16.970
[laughter]

02:17.971 --> 02:20.140
Suit and tie, I'm impressed.

02:20.174 --> 02:21.375
Yeah, I'm kind of proud of it.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.743
[laughter]

02:22.776 --> 02:24.745
Of course, I would have
made him wear a dress.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.547
[laughter]

02:26.580 --> 02:27.581
Too late.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.649
You only get one wish.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.418
[laughter]

02:30.451 --> 02:32.853
[theme music]

03:37.818 --> 03:39.787
[laughing]

03:39.820 --> 03:42.222
[music playing]

03:44.792 --> 03:46.860
Dan, can we close the shades?

03:46.894 --> 03:49.029
I feel real guilty
playing in the day time.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.464
[laughter]

03:50.498 --> 03:53.701
Hey, this is the Conner
Unemployment Invitational.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.868
[laughter]

03:54.902 --> 03:56.604
I'm figuring as long as
we're all out of work,

03:56.637 --> 03:59.307
we might as well use
our time productively.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.108
[laughter]

04:02.142 --> 04:04.712
Well, this is stupid.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
Do I really have to do this?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.681
It's Indian poker.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.684
Everybody can see your
fifth card but you.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.553
So how do I know what to bet?

04:12.586 --> 04:13.787
Well, that's the challenge.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.022
It's not a game for the timid.

04:15.055 --> 04:15.956
[laughter]

04:15.989 --> 04:18.258
I'll bet a penny.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.627
[laughter]

04:19.660 --> 04:21.495
Too rich for this guy.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.397
Yeah, my wife would kill me.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.598
I'm rich, I'm rich.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.099
I'm fabulously well off.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.001
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

04:28.035 --> 04:29.903
Give me the cards.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.938
Wait a minute.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.640
Oh, who's been
eating Oreo cookies?

04:32.673 --> 04:33.741
[laughter]

04:33.774 --> 04:35.042
Oh, yeah, I had some
of those yesterday.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.477
- Ugh!
- Ick!

04:36.510 --> 04:37.378
New game.

04:40.414 --> 04:46.086
So, how the job front
for you, Fisher, man?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.155
What, are you kidding?

04:48.188 --> 04:50.157
This is a rotten time to
be a freelance artist.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.360
I-- I'm down to working
a couple days a week.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.995
Well, that's a
couple more than me.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.597
It's brutal out there.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.765
You guys are smart.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.568
Being self-employed's
the only way to go.

05:00.601 --> 05:04.472
I'll bet an eighth of a cent.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.973
[laughter]

05:07.375 --> 05:10.744
Yeah, being your own boss
isn't that great of a deal.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.713
Last week I sexually
harassed myself.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.482
[laughter]

05:15.949 --> 05:16.884
Three jacks.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.051
Read 'em and weep.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.186
Somebody get the boy a hanky.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.087
Full boat.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.889
[boat horn imitation]

05:21.922 --> 05:22.790
[laughter]

05:22.823 --> 05:23.757
Damn it!

05:23.791 --> 05:25.959
My luck has totally
turned to crap!

05:25.993 --> 05:27.294
Hey, Fisher, chill.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.328
We're just playing for fun.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.296
No, no, no.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.498
I mean, this is
just one more thing.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.265
I mean, no matter what I
do, I can't catch a break!

05:32.299 --> 05:33.601
Over here.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.635
Now you're ahead for the night.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.736
Hey, go to hell!

05:35.769 --> 05:37.605
[clattering]

05:40.941 --> 05:41.742
Sorry.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.414
I gotta take a breather.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.985
Well, he's wrapped
kinda tight, huh?

05:52.019 --> 05:52.886
Poor guy.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.255
[telephone ringing]

05:55.288 --> 05:57.425
Remember when you were that
age, you still thought your life

05:57.458 --> 05:58.792
was gonna amount to something?

05:58.826 --> 06:00.227
[laughter]

06:00.260 --> 06:02.362
Yeah, I'm glad
those days are over.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.664
[laughter]

06:04.197 --> 06:04.932
Hello?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.803
Well this could be one
of DJ Connor's parents.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.338
It depends on how much
damage is involved.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.006
[laughter]

06:13.040 --> 06:15.743
He did?

06:15.776 --> 06:16.710
OK.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.679
Yeah, I will.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.581
Thank you.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.482
What's up?

06:21.515 --> 06:22.850
Oh man.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.586
DJ got caught with obscene
reading material at school

06:25.619 --> 06:27.354
today.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.389
They want somebody to come down.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.624
I'll bet it was one
of my "Playboys."

06:30.658 --> 06:32.192
[laughter]

06:32.225 --> 06:33.160
Oh, man.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.295
I shoulda hid them better.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.397
So, uh, where'd you hide them?

06:37.431 --> 06:38.298
I don't know.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.199
I can't find them.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.601
[laughter]

06:40.634 --> 06:42.870
[music playing]

06:44.037 --> 06:45.338
No, Dan.

06:45.372 --> 06:48.476
It's about time you handle
some of these school problems.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.678
Yes, Dan, I know
you're very involved

06:50.711 --> 06:54.147
in your children's education.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.349
James Madison Elementary School.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.285
[laughter]

06:58.318 --> 07:01.655
It's on the corner of
Carpenter and Fifth.

07:01.689 --> 07:05.092
And DJ is the short
kid with dark hair.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.860
[laughter]

07:06.894 --> 07:09.863
What kind of obscene reading
material could DJ have?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.131
I don't know.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.333
Either one of Dan's "Playboys,"
or our credit report.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.334
[laughter]

07:14.367 --> 07:16.737
[music playing]

07:25.278 --> 07:26.514
Deja vu.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.881
[laughter]

07:29.917 --> 07:33.053
I am really angry with you, DJ.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.922
Those magazines are
not for you to read.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.257
And you know it's wrong to go
through other people's things.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.893
You are in big trouble
when I get you home, pal.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.194
Can I help you?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.263
Yeah, I'm here to see
Principal Alexander.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.364
And you are?

07:44.397 --> 07:46.066
Dan Conner, DJ's father.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.300
No he's not!

07:47.334 --> 07:48.435
I don't know who he is.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.937
Don't let me go home with him!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.438
[laughter]

07:51.471 --> 07:53.574
He's kidding.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.676
Tell the nice lady
you're kidding, DJ.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.610
How do you know my name?

07:56.644 --> 07:57.511
DJ!

07:57.545 --> 07:59.279
[laughter]

08:00.280 --> 08:02.215
He's my dad.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.051
You know, in all the
years Conner children

08:04.084 --> 08:06.353
have come to this school,
we've never seen you.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.255
We all assumed Mrs.
Conner was widowed.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.156
She is.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.057
I'm her oldest boy.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.925
[laughter]

08:14.027 --> 08:15.596
Oh, our principal.

08:15.629 --> 08:20.000
Cecil Alexander, Dan
Conner, DJ's father.

08:20.033 --> 08:20.901
We thought you were dead.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.335
[laughter]

08:23.336 --> 08:26.406
Come in, Mr. Conner, DJ.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.743
Listen, I want you to know we're
usually very happy with DJ.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.144
He's a hard worker.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.446
He listens well in class.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.916
Although this new dressing up
phase does concern us a little.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.217
[laughter]

08:38.218 --> 08:39.386
Kids.

08:39.419 --> 08:42.890
But we don't discourage
unorthodox dress here.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.558
We do discourage,
however, our students

08:44.592 --> 08:48.128
from bringing certain types
of reading material to school.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.663
Well, I understand,
Cecil, something

08:49.697 --> 08:53.233
that might be perfectly normal
and acceptable for adults

08:53.266 --> 08:56.837
wouldn't be OK for kids
to bring to school.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.939
I'm sorry, but the
filth that DJ was reading

08:58.972 --> 09:01.775
couldn't possibly be
considered OK anywhere.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.376
It's the most
offensively sick piece

09:03.410 --> 09:05.212
of garbage I've ever seen.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.246
Didn't you read the articles?

09:06.279 --> 09:08.148
[laughter]

09:09.717 --> 09:12.019
I didn't see any
articles in this.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.187
Oh, it's a comic book.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.589
DJ, you brought a
comic book to school.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.489
Good boy.

09:16.523 --> 09:17.758
[laughter]

09:18.992 --> 09:21.194
I can see I should have
spoken to his mother.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.196
Well, look, I know
it's wrong for kids

09:23.230 --> 09:25.498
to bring comics to school
and read them in class,

09:25.532 --> 09:27.134
but hey, they're kids!

09:27.167 --> 09:31.271
I know it's not great
literature-- my god,

09:31.304 --> 09:34.107
what kind of diseased mind could
create something like this?

09:34.141 --> 09:35.408
[laughter]

09:35.442 --> 09:38.245
It's obviously some kind
of cheap underground thing.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.080
Oh, man.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.850
Hey, I don't know
where DJ got this,

09:42.883 --> 09:44.351
but you can be
sure we don't allow

09:44.384 --> 09:45.552
things like this in our house.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.888
This is not the way
we raise our children.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.923
Where did you get this?

09:49.957 --> 09:53.393
Darlene made it.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.829
[music playing]

10:04.404 --> 10:08.341
Well, Jackie, I'm
feeling kind of kooky.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.210
What do you say me and
you go bowling tonight?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.845
Hey, on Wednesday
night they'll let you

10:11.879 --> 10:13.914
eat right in the bowling area.

10:13.947 --> 10:14.848
[laughter]

10:14.882 --> 10:16.116
Can't.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.418
Fisher and I are doing
something tonight.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.688
Well, so are me
and Dan, probably.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.990
But that doesn't mean we
can't go bowling first.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.957
[laughter]

10:23.991 --> 10:26.259
You and I work
together, Roseanne.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.227
Isn't that enough?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.595
God, this really sucks.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.797
Every time I ask
you to do anything,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.198
you're always busy with Fisher.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.566
Don't do this to me.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.802
You know I have a boyfriend now.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.236
It takes up a lot of my time!

10:36.269 --> 10:38.706
Yeah, well, when I was
first dating Dan and things

10:38.739 --> 10:42.009
were all hot and heavy still,
I'd always make time for you.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.044
Yeah, when you wanted
a ride somewhere.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.245
What's somebody to
go get you pizza.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.747
Wanted somebody to do
your homework for you.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.781
Well, at least I made time.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.684
Well, this takes
a little more effort

10:50.718 --> 10:52.820
than a high school romance.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.422
You know, I live with
Fisher, Roseanne.

10:55.455 --> 10:58.291
Well, so maybe
that's your problem.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.594
Maybe you and Fisher spend
too much time together.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.732
I never would have moved in
with no guy so damn fast.

11:04.765 --> 11:05.833
Maybe you wouldn't.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.335
But this isn't you, it's me.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.437
And there's a real easy
way to tell us apart.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.504
You.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.405
Me.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.874
[laughter]

11:14.875 --> 11:16.810
You!

11:16.844 --> 11:17.778
Me!

11:17.811 --> 11:19.679
[laughter]

11:24.517 --> 11:25.919
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

11:25.953 --> 11:27.154
We're in the middle
of a shift here.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.321
I'm leaving.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.390
Till you respect
my relationships

11:30.423 --> 11:31.992
you're not gonna see me again.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.994
Oh, well I didn't
realize it's such a drag

11:34.027 --> 11:35.028
spending any time with me.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.564
Sorry, I'm not gonna
ask you no more.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.800
Oh, good, go
for the guilt. You

11:39.833 --> 11:43.170
better take a long, hard
look at yourself, Roseanne.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.239
Because if you are this
obsessed with my life,

11:46.273 --> 11:50.277
there is obviously something
missing from yours.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.245
Just figure that out?

11:52.279 --> 11:53.346
[laughter]

11:53.380 --> 11:55.749
[music playing]

12:00.754 --> 12:03.256
Well, Dan, my day
dealing with the family

12:03.290 --> 12:04.892
was an ice cream
cone in the dirt.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.259
How was yours?

12:06.293 --> 12:09.096
Well, honey, I hate to top
you, but I got a two for one.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.199
That obscene reading material
DJ brought to school--

12:12.232 --> 12:14.601
Darlene's the editor-in-chief.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.502
Take a look at this.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.737
It's really sick.

12:17.771 --> 12:18.705
[laughing]

12:18.738 --> 12:20.540
[laughter]

12:25.445 --> 12:26.413
Well, it was a funny part.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.314
[laughter]

12:27.347 --> 12:28.748
I'm serious, Rosie.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.884
What if Darlene's disturbed?

12:30.918 --> 12:32.019
More than we thought.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.988
Oh, Dan, have you seen
some of the comic books

12:35.022 --> 12:36.489
that she buys lately?

12:36.523 --> 12:38.892
They're way more
screwed up than that.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.428
Warped and depressing
is what's cool now.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.562
Really?

12:42.595 --> 12:45.065
Yeah, finally Darlene's
personality pays off.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.166
[laughter]

12:47.200 --> 12:49.036
Hey, we had
underground comics,

12:49.069 --> 12:51.805
but it wasn't like this
crap Darlene's doing.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.141
Ours were about depraved
sex and massive drug abuse.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.308
This is a cry for help.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.509
[laughter]

12:56.543 --> 12:58.711
Well, who knows what
they're about, you know?

12:58.745 --> 13:00.213
Who even wants to?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.615
The longer we don't know
what's in Darlene's head,

13:02.649 --> 13:04.251
the longer we don't
sleep in shifts.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.986
[laughter]

13:08.121 --> 13:08.989
Hey.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.892
Oh, hold it right there.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.261
You were very, very mean to
me, and hurt my feelings today.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.030
And I'm not sure that I even
want to talk to you yet.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.199
I came here to apologize.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.001
I have been blowing
you off a lot lately.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.569
And there's no excuse for it.

13:22.602 --> 13:26.173
I'm a selfish, rotten
person, and I'm sorry.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.140
Is that it?

13:27.174 --> 13:28.641
[laughter]

13:28.675 --> 13:31.378
- Roseanne.
- Oh, all right.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.680
I'm such a softy.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.482
And to make up for
being such a jerk,

13:35.515 --> 13:37.217
I want to take you to a movie.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.853
Just you and me, my treat.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.089
OK, well, you'll have to
go put on a better shirt.

13:42.122 --> 13:42.990
Why?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.892
We're going to a movie.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.894
No, you feel way
worse than that.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.229
You're taking me
out to dinner, too.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.530
Fine.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.933
Do you think Darlene would
mind if I went upstairs

13:52.966 --> 13:54.001
and borrowed something?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.235
No, as long as you
put everything back

13:55.268 --> 13:56.336
on the floor where you find it.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.304
[laughter]

13:57.337 --> 13:58.238
[door closing]

13:58.271 --> 14:00.140
Hey.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.741
What's my comic book
doing down here?

14:01.774 --> 14:03.843
DJ got caught with
it at school today.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.712
We have to talk.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.746
That's it.

14:06.779 --> 14:07.780
Hire a hearse, pick out a plot.

14:07.814 --> 14:08.681
DJ!

14:08.715 --> 14:10.617
[laughter]

14:31.071 --> 14:32.973
[laughter]

14:37.544 --> 14:40.547
It's over, Rat Boy!
JACKIE: Close the door!

14:40.580 --> 14:41.381
Close the door!

14:46.353 --> 14:48.688
[footsteps on stairs]

14:51.724 --> 14:53.760
What happened to Aunt Jackie?

14:53.793 --> 14:55.963
Well, some say
environment, but I

14:55.996 --> 14:57.064
think she's born that way.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.831
[laughter]

15:00.300 --> 15:03.870
No, I mean, was she, like,
in an accident or something?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.805
No.
Why?

15:05.838 --> 15:08.308
I saw her upstairs, and
her back's all bruised up.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.676
[footsteps on stairs]

15:09.709 --> 15:12.045
She didn't tell
me nothing about it.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.846
Sorry for yelling at
you like that, Darlene.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.216
You scared the heck out of me.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.517
Are you OK?

15:17.550 --> 15:18.718
Yeah.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.787
You ready to go?

15:20.820 --> 15:21.788
Come here.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.357
What?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.159
Darlene says your
back's all bruised up.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.961
No.
It's nothing.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.062
Well, then let me see.

15:29.096 --> 15:29.963
No, no.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.131
Come on, stand still.

15:31.164 --> 15:34.101
Don't.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.337
Darlene, you get out of here.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.338
What's going on?

15:38.371 --> 15:39.172
Now, Darlene.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.410
Look, I'm all right,
so don't go blowing this

15:43.443 --> 15:44.411
up into something it's not.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.412
OK?
- What happened?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.313
Nothing.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.680
Let's go eat.
- No.

15:47.714 --> 15:48.982
We're not gonna go anywhere
until you tell me how your back

15:49.016 --> 15:49.949
got all bruised up like that.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.819
I told you I'm OK!

15:52.852 --> 15:55.122
You come over here, your
back is all bruised up,

15:55.155 --> 15:56.689
you won't tell me
nothing about it!

15:56.723 --> 16:00.460
How do I know you didn't get
raped, or mugged, or something?

16:00.493 --> 16:01.995
Does Fisher know about this?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.467
Why-- why can't
you just drop it?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.871
That son of a bitch!

16:11.904 --> 16:14.074
You don't understand.

16:14.107 --> 16:14.974
He beat the crap--

16:15.008 --> 16:16.776
No he didn't!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.045
It's no big deal.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.079
It's no big deal?

16:19.112 --> 16:20.713
What are you saying?
He hit you.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.049
It's not like he
forgot your birthday!

16:22.082 --> 16:23.583
Look, we had an
argument this afternoon,

16:23.616 --> 16:24.817
and he pushed me a couple times.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.254
It's not Fisher's fault.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.455
Then whose fault is it?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.956
I can't believe that
you're saying this.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.292
You don't even listen to me!

16:32.325 --> 16:34.894
He said he was sorry, and
it would never happen again.

16:34.927 --> 16:35.795
[sigh]

16:35.828 --> 16:38.131
Damn, Jackie, you were a cop!

16:38.165 --> 16:40.267
You heard this same
crap a million times!

16:40.300 --> 16:41.301
Now you've thrown it out on me.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.535
How could you let
this happen to you?

16:42.569 --> 16:43.436
Shut up!

16:43.470 --> 16:46.439
You don't know the whole story!

16:46.473 --> 16:47.874
He's been under a lot
of pressure lately.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.476
There's no work.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.777
And I told him
that he should look

16:50.810 --> 16:52.379
for a job at a bigger company.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.647
And he told me that I
didn't believe in him.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.084
And he told me a
million times, when

16:57.117 --> 16:59.252
he gets in a mood like that,
that I should just walk away.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.320
And I didn't.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.122
I just kept pushing
him and pushing him.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.223
Don't say any more.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.428
What happened?

17:11.398 --> 17:13.366
Fisher beat the
crap out of her.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.367
What?

17:14.401 --> 17:15.268
I'm all right.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.469
I just-- I--

17:16.503 --> 17:18.538
[crying] I don't want
anybody to know about it.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.410
Is she really OK?

17:23.443 --> 17:24.877
Yeah.

17:24.911 --> 17:25.978
Come on.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.013
We're gonna go wash your face.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.260
[music playing]

17:44.564 --> 17:46.733
How you doing?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.468
Pretty good.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.203
[sigh]

17:51.571 --> 17:57.810
Well, I think we, um, just
should go to the hospital

17:57.844 --> 17:58.745
and get you checked out.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.613
It's too
humiliating, Roseanne,

18:00.647 --> 18:01.781
they'll ask all
kinds of questions.

18:01.814 --> 18:05.118
I don't want everybody
talking about it.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.287
OK, well, we'll go to
the hospital in Elgin.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.088
Nobody knows us there.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.557
We can make up names, and stuff.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.325
[door closing]

18:12.359 --> 18:14.227
I'll be Wilma, and
you can be Betty.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.895
[laughter]
DAN: Hey.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.564
- Hey.
- Where'd you go?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.099
Oh, I thought I'd
go get some dinner.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.168
I got your favorite.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.635
I told them to just
fry up the skin.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.437
None of that pesky
chicken to get in the way.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.672
[laughter]

18:25.705 --> 18:27.207
Well, so we'll eat some
of it in the car on the way

18:27.240 --> 18:28.875
to the hospital.
- [sigh]

18:28.908 --> 18:29.842
Roseanne.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.511
Come on, just go get ready.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.188
So, did you see Fisher?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.355
[gasp]

18:43.556 --> 18:45.158
Oh my god, you didn't
kill him and then go

18:45.192 --> 18:46.259
buy chicken, did you?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.027
[laughter]

18:49.061 --> 18:50.797
No, I bought
the chicken first.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.499
[laughter]

18:52.532 --> 18:55.368
I thought you were just gonna
go over there and scare him.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.570
Well, it started out that way.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.938
What'd he say?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.674
Well, if I remember
correctly, ouch, ouch, my head.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.543
[laughter]

19:05.077 --> 19:06.746
Something along those lines.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.615
[doorbell ringing]

19:08.648 --> 19:10.783
Dan, you gotta put
some alcohol on that.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.684
Good idea.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.586
[laughter]

19:22.562 --> 19:26.165
Hi, Rosie, Dan.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.267
Can we come in?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.135
Well, that depends on
what you're here for.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.004
Let them in, honey.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.840
Mr. Conner, we have a
warrant for your arrest.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
There's been an assault and
battery complaint filed on you.

19:35.908 --> 19:36.876
[door closing]
- Yeah.

19:36.909 --> 19:37.977
I heard the call
come in on the radio,

19:38.010 --> 19:40.847
so I just told dispatch
that we'd take it.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.014
I'm sorry, Rosie.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.383
You can't arrest Dan.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.817
He didn't do anything wrong.

19:44.851 --> 19:45.885
Jackie came over here--

19:45.918 --> 19:47.687
Roseanne, this is about me.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.256
It's not about anybody else.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.023
Let's leave it at that.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.725
Rosie, what you need to
do is get to the station

19:52.759 --> 19:54.394
as quick as you
can, with the bail.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.796
It's gonna be about $100.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.731
We'll stall processing
Dan as long as we can.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.533
Sorry, Mr. Conner,
but we gotta cuff you.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.434
No cuffs.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.969
Hey, cuff me.

20:03.002 --> 20:05.405
If you get fired, who's
gonna fix my parking tickets?

20:05.438 --> 20:07.139
[laughter]

20:09.008 --> 20:10.743
Well, can he at least
have some chicken?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.011
He hasn't had dinner yet.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.880
[laughter]

20:18.351 --> 20:20.186
[laughter]

20:21.254 --> 20:22.655
All right, I'll drive.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.156
[laughter]

20:25.157 --> 20:27.560
[music playing]

20:40.106 --> 20:42.575
[road noise]

20:42.609 --> 20:46.313
Hey, can you get one of
these for a regular car?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.681
It'd make trips with
the kids a lot more fun.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.617
[laughter]

20:50.650 --> 20:52.885
Heh, it's funny.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.754
Joanie and I were just
today talking about getting

20:54.787 --> 20:57.290
together with you and Rosie.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.391
When's good for you?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.692
[laughter]

20:59.726 --> 21:03.095
Well, I'm busy tonight, but
other than that, I'm cool.

21:03.129 --> 21:03.996
Great.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.866
Pretty weird, huh?

21:06.899 --> 21:07.967
Mind blowing.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.469
Mr. Conner, if you
don't mind my asking,

21:09.502 --> 21:10.537
how come you popped that guy?

21:10.570 --> 21:13.406
You messed him up
pretty good, you know.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.274
Long story.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.410
POLICEMAN: Understood.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.145
Look, it's not
gonna be so bad.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.747
By the time we finish
processing you,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.582
Rosie will be there
with the bail.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.684
Nobody's gotta know about this.

21:24.717 --> 21:25.518
Appreciate it.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.527
[laughter]

21:36.429 --> 21:37.530
[applause]

21:46.339 --> 21:47.440
[laughter]

21:51.744 --> 21:54.381
