WEBVTT

00:41.708 --> 00:43.418
Any sign of that bounty hunter?

00:43.501 --> 00:45.837
The only vessel
in our scanners is Crosshair's

00:45.920 --> 00:47.255
and he is right on top of us.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.051
Don't let them get away.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.221
It's getting hot back here!

00:55.305 --> 00:56.389
Prepping to jump.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.474
Not without Omega.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.893
The bounty hunter
who took her is long gone.

00:59.976 --> 01:03.730
We'll have no chance of finding them
if Crosshair shoots us down.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.108
Rear deflector shields are failing.

01:10.653 --> 01:11.863
Make the jump.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.394
-

01:44.104 --> 01:45.897
Let me out of here!

01:45.980 --> 01:47.315
Afraid not.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.030
-Looking for your communication device?
-

01:54.114 --> 01:57.617
It has been confiscated
and placed in a secure compartment.

01:57.701 --> 02:02.205
I said let me out of here.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.208
I would advise you to cooperate.

02:05.750 --> 02:10.672
Mr. Bane does not respond well
to prisoners who are difficult.

02:16.970 --> 02:21.433
-How's my asset doing?
-My name is Omega.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.518
Who are you?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.771
Cad Bane at your service.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.274
Where are you taking me?

02:33.862 --> 02:36.448
You'll be sorry
when my friends come for me.

02:37.574 --> 02:42.120
Your friends are long gone.
I made sure of that.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.165
No one is coming for you, little lady.

02:46.207 --> 02:50.754
Now sit tight and don't cause any trouble.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.257
But when will you have time to fix my leg?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.384
It is quite inconvenient.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.596
Bane, did you hear me?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.849
Mr. Bane. Mr. Bane.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.277
-I have the girl.
-What is her condition?

03:14.361 --> 03:18.448
Alive, so I expect a premium.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.159
See that she stays that way.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.827
That depends on you.

03:23.495 --> 03:27.874
I'll be at the rendezvous.
Bring my unmarked credits.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.463
I will deliver the payment
and retrieve Omega.

03:33.546 --> 03:38.468
Your personal interest in the young clone
has threatened our operation enough.

03:39.803 --> 03:44.891
Taun We, you will go
to our abandoned facility on Bora Vio.

03:44.974 --> 03:49.938
Bring the bounty hunter his payment
and recover our property.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.607
Yes, Prime Minister.

03:53.441 --> 03:58.238
When the clone is returned,
confine her to the sublevel facility.

03:58.321 --> 04:03.034
Once you have retrieved the genetic
material needed, terminate her.

04:12.293 --> 04:16.673
This is all that clone's fault.
He shot my leg off.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.052
He was protecting me.
That's what friends do.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.596
Why isn't yours helping you?

04:24.222 --> 04:27.225
Well, Mr. Bane is very busy.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.487
I could fix your leg if you want.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.531
I mean, it's a simple booster adjustment.

04:41.614 --> 04:45.118
I've done it a bunch of times
for AZI-3 back on Kamino.

04:45.201 --> 04:48.121
I am a techno service droid.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.499
I am quite capable
of completing my own repairs.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.878
You are a prisoner
and are not to be trusted.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.672
Have it your way.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.847
Your description of the bounty hunter is
a match to one from the Republic's files.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.265
That's him.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.850
Cad Bane.

05:08.933 --> 05:10.977
He had multiple run-ins with the Jedi

05:11.061 --> 05:14.189
and was responsible for attempting
to abduct Chancellor Palpatine.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.650
First the bounty hunter on Pantora
and now this guy?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.194
Why are they after the kid?

05:19.277 --> 05:21.696
Because she is more valuable
than we realized.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.822
What do you mean?

05:22.906 --> 05:25.367
I further analyzed Omega's genetic profile

05:25.450 --> 05:28.578
and discovered she has pure,
first-generation DNA.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.246
Whoa!

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
Wait. W-W-What does that mean?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.794
All clones were created from
a host named Jango Fett.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.631
While our genetic structure was modified
for growth acceleration and obedience,

05:39.714 --> 05:42.217
Omega is a pure genetic replication.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.843
How many clones like that exist?

05:43.927 --> 05:46.137
To my knowledge there's only one other.

05:46.221 --> 05:50.642
A male clone code-named Alpha,
later referred to as Boba.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.228
Since he disappeared
at the start of the war,

05:53.311 --> 05:57.899
that makes Omega the sole living source
of Fett's raw genetic material.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.860
If she's vital
to the Kaminoans' cloning operation,

06:00.944 --> 06:02.654
they must have put the bounty on her.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.365
So how do we find this bounty hunter?

06:05.448 --> 06:08.284
Tech, check with Cid.
See if her contacts know anything.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.953
We'll keep monitoring comms.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.084
-Look, you need to rewire…
-

06:16.167 --> 06:18.461
…the servos in your hip first.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.214
That is what I am trying to do.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.800
Will you just let me help you?

06:23.883 --> 06:25.927
You are a prisoner.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.013
Exactly.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.557
It's not like I can escape off this ship.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.143
That is a valid point.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.437
I'm only a kid.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.398
Oh, all right, but make it quick.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.984
And not a word of this to anyone.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.903
Of course not.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.330
-

06:59.502 --> 07:02.547
Okay. Let's get to work.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.132
Do not try anything funny.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.343
Mr. Bane will be back shortly.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.345
How long have you been working for him?

07:08.428 --> 07:09.721
Many years.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.556
I am his trusted confidant.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.433
We are a team.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.977
Really? He's not very nice to you.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.064
On the contrary,
my treatment is perfectly adequate…

07:20.023 --> 07:21.274
most of the time.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.693
There. How does your leg feel?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.028
It is misaligned.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.490
You will need to adjust the calibration,
but be careful.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.743
Relax. I've done this before.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.294
Oh, my. Yes. That's working.

07:41.961 --> 07:46.257
It feels brand-new.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.510
Sorry.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.969
It's only temporary.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.516
Now, where did you hide my comm device?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.492
Todo, get your chassis up here.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.536
I can't see anything in this chop.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.273
Todo, get up here.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.276
Todo?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.914
Come on, come on, come on.
Where is it?

09:00.582 --> 09:01.499
Ah, yes!

09:03.001 --> 09:05.420
Ya glitchy droid.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.630
What's taking so long?

09:15.722 --> 09:18.058
Todo? Where's the kid?

09:18.141 --> 09:22.145
Mr. Bane,
she's quite obviously right there.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.023
Oh.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.233
Uh-oh.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.943
Wait here.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.451
Hello? Is anyone there? Can you hear me?

09:39.371 --> 09:42.957
Yeah. Cid knows all about Bane
but not how to find him.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.001
She said we're on our own.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.837
Come in. Come in.

09:47.921 --> 09:48.880
Anyone?
-Omega!

09:48.963 --> 09:51.091
Omega, are you there? Omega!

09:51.174 --> 09:53.218
It's long-range.
I'll try to boost the signal.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.766
Is anyone there?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.601
Omega, do you copy?

10:03.645 --> 10:06.773
I'm here.
I got away, but you have to hurry.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.609
Where are you?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.196
I… I-- I don't know where I am.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.280
Hang on, kid.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.907
We're coming for ya!

10:15.990 --> 10:19.661
The signal's too weak
to establish a direct connection trace.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.831
Omega, we need a relay of your position.

10:22.914 --> 10:27.419
Try to create a power surge.
Can you find a panel nearby?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.838
There's one by a door.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.007
It looks like the ones on Tipoca City.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.343
That's good.
First, see if you can activate it.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.394
-It worked. Now what should I do?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.104
Next you will need
to reroute the circuits

10:46.187 --> 10:47.647
to overload the main grid.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.566
By hook or by crook…

10:50.775 --> 10:52.402
You're coming with me.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.653
Omega?

10:53.737 --> 10:55.405
-Get off of--
- Do you copy?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.074
Let me go!
-I still can't get a good read.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.284
Hunter, I need you!

10:59.367 --> 11:00.493
Omega!

11:01.619 --> 11:02.912
-Omega--
-

11:06.791 --> 11:08.585
It really does feel brand new.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.048
Mr. Bane,
an unidentified ship is approaching.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.341
Check it out.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.303
No.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.263
I am not going with you.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.557
You're lucky they want you alive.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.892
Who wants me?

11:23.975 --> 11:26.311
You'll soon find out.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.604
-

11:29.147 --> 11:31.775
I told you you'd be sorry
when my friends showed up.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.401
Quiet.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.209
Taun We?

11:51.086 --> 11:52.712
She needs help!

11:52.796 --> 11:54.381
None you can give.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.257
He's right.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.720
Fennec Shand.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.222
Hello, Bane.

12:02.305 --> 12:06.851
You got no business messin' with my score.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.855
You of all people know
it's all about the price.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.608
Besides, she was my score first.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.069
Omega and I go way back.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.779
Don't we?

12:18.279 --> 12:22.242
You lack the experience
to be goin' up against me.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.328
Yet, I'm the one who has the payment.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.374
That's my case you're holdin'.

12:29.457 --> 12:33.003
Hand it over
and I'll let you walk outta here.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.296
How about a trade?

12:35.380 --> 12:37.298
The case for the girl.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.759
Sounds fair.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.136
You first.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.644
I have the case!

13:06.703 --> 13:08.288
-My credits!
-

13:18.131 --> 13:20.258
Todo! Find the kid.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.468
I am on it!

13:36.691 --> 13:39.402
You should know when to quit, Shand.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.794
I think I've got her.
She's in the Lido system.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.755
Where in the Lido system?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.715
I'm pinpointing the exact coordinates.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.008
Hang on!

15:33.433 --> 15:34.768
Mr. Bane!

15:36.478 --> 15:40.523
Do not worry. I will recover the target.
I will not fail you!

15:45.904 --> 15:47.739
They won't get here in time.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.534
The only person
you can rely on is yourself.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.120
Why did you kill Taun We?

15:54.204 --> 15:55.830
Part of the job.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.499
You should thank me.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.584
What their Prime Minister
has planned for you

15:59.668 --> 16:01.461
is far worse than why I'm here.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.463
What does he want me for?

16:04.214 --> 16:05.674
You already know the answer.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.185
Omega, I'm trying to help you.

16:17.268 --> 16:20.355
You said the same thing on Pantora.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.358
There you are! You are coming with--

16:23.441 --> 16:25.276
-

16:32.283 --> 16:35.912
It's too late for that.
It's time to go, Omega.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.813
Flight pods.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.036
Playtime's over, little lady.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.664
-

17:20.248 --> 17:23.460
-

17:27.547 --> 17:29.632
-

17:32.093 --> 17:35.638
-

18:06.002 --> 18:07.796
Going for the flight pod?

18:10.090 --> 18:12.217
That will not get you very far.

18:14.219 --> 18:17.806
-You are coming with me.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.391
Let me go!

18:37.909 --> 18:40.870
-

19:04.436 --> 19:07.105
-

19:08.148 --> 19:09.441
-Ah ah ah.
-

19:09.524 --> 19:11.526
Where do you think you're going?

19:12.944 --> 19:14.154
Oh, no!

19:15.321 --> 19:17.449
You'll be sorry for this…

19:28.460 --> 19:31.504
Bane, the target is getting away!

19:36.134 --> 19:37.469
Get to the ship!

19:46.728 --> 19:48.229
-

20:09.042 --> 20:10.960
-

20:11.044 --> 20:12.712
Ugh! No!

20:15.340 --> 20:17.509
-

20:44.703 --> 20:47.664
-Omega! Are you in there?
-Wrecker!

20:51.459 --> 20:54.462
Aw! Good to have you back, kid.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.145
Are you okay, Omega? Are you hurt?

21:11.980 --> 21:16.151
Why is this happening?
Why are the Kaminoans after me?

21:17.402 --> 21:20.405
Hunter, you have to tell her.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.286
You're valuable to them.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.456
More than all the other clones.
Even more than us.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.000
You're different.

21:33.752 --> 21:36.171
Different? How?

21:43.053 --> 21:44.721
Get us in the air.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.807
I am trying,
but our systems are not responding.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.481
-They appear to have been sabotaged.
-

22:08.036 --> 22:10.121
I require an update.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.416
Omega was rescued by the same clones
I encountered on Pantora.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.753
I can track them,
but that will cost extra.

22:16.836 --> 22:17.837
No.

22:18.546 --> 22:22.676
As long as she is not in the hands
of Lama Su, she is safe.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.053
I will transfer your payment.

22:25.136 --> 22:28.348
If you change your mind,
you know how to reach me.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.177
-Can't sleep?

23:06.845 --> 23:09.597
I keep thinking about the Kaminoans.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.392
Seeing that place.

23:12.934 --> 23:15.854
I don't want to end up
an experiment in a tube.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.814
That's not gonna happen.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.025
If I'm as valuable as you say,

23:20.650 --> 23:23.570
Lama Su will keep sending
bounty hunters after me.

23:24.154 --> 23:26.322
He can send everyone in the galaxy.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.199
You have us.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.370
You can't fight them all.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.086
Omega, you don't have to worry.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.797
You are never going back to Kamino.

23:44.758 --> 23:45.884
Promise?

23:46.634 --> 23:47.927
I promise.
