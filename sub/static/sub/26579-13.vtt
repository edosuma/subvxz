WEBVTT

00:08.500 --> 00:10.007
You didn't nap, did you?

00:10.044 --> 00:11.376
I didn't have time.

00:11.546 --> 00:13.265
I've got to find a new place to live.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.484
No excuse, Boot.

00:14.521 --> 00:16.487
Napping is the key to Midnight Shift.

00:16.708 --> 00:19.008
No shorter than 20 minutes.
No longer than 40.

00:19.154 --> 00:20.555
But, hey, if you're
comfortable ignoring

00:20.591 --> 00:21.773
my institutional wisdom...

00:21.810 --> 00:23.143
I'm getting evicted.

00:23.180 --> 00:25.313
- And whose fault is that?
- Not mine.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.426
They're turning my building
into condos.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.828
That's what happens when you gentrify

00:28.865 --> 00:30.735
a working-class neighborhood.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:40.726 --> 00:42.274
What the hell is that?

00:42.437 --> 00:43.743
What?

00:43.778 --> 00:45.304
That.

00:50.688 --> 00:52.621
There was a guy standing there
with a mask on.

00:52.658 --> 00:54.186
He was like seven feet tall.

00:54.768 --> 00:56.435
Mm-hmm.

00:57.283 --> 00:59.835
I saw him. He was right there.

00:59.872 --> 01:01.188
Boot, if you make me

01:01.225 --> 01:02.568
get out of this car

01:02.605 --> 01:04.872
for a hallucination...

01:19.246 --> 01:20.679
What...

01:23.818 --> 01:25.817
God, he was right here.

01:27.657 --> 01:29.548
Make-believe time is over.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.536
Stop! Police!

01:59.209 --> 02:00.970
Tim?

02:13.770 --> 02:15.150
Step out.

02:17.337 --> 02:18.804
Step out!

02:23.276 --> 02:24.978
Hands where I can see them.

02:27.113 --> 02:29.413
Peel the mask off slowly.

02:29.738 --> 02:31.337
Slowly.

02:40.181 --> 02:43.060
Welcome to Midnight, Officer Chen.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.062
Oh, my God.

02:50.259 --> 02:51.935
No. No.

03:03.148 --> 03:05.337
Hey. Happy to be back on days?

03:05.374 --> 03:06.611
God, yes.

03:06.648 --> 03:08.486
I don't know if you heard,
but it was...

03:10.267 --> 03:12.935
- Tim had shirts made.
- Of course he did.

03:13.025 --> 03:15.425
Well, you know, just wait
until it's your turn,

03:15.460 --> 03:16.970
Officer <i> In Bed By Ten.</i>

03:17.007 --> 03:18.940
What can I say: I'm a morning person.

03:19.097 --> 03:20.531
Mm-hmm.

03:22.688 --> 03:24.636
- Good morning.
- You're here bright and early.

03:24.673 --> 03:26.220
Hey, if you're not early, you're late.

03:26.257 --> 03:27.571
That's a stupid saying.

03:27.606 --> 03:29.272
- What's her problem?
- Uh...

03:29.307 --> 03:30.597
I wore mine in too!

03:30.634 --> 03:31.900
It's not the t-shirt...

03:31.937 --> 03:33.069
although, it is annoying.

03:33.106 --> 03:34.564
I can't find a place to live.

03:34.601 --> 03:35.931
You could always move back home.

03:35.968 --> 03:37.446
No, I really can't.

03:37.481 --> 03:38.657
Or you can bunk up with Nolan.

03:38.694 --> 03:40.481
- He lives in a mansion.
- Hey, it's not a mansion.

03:40.518 --> 03:43.064
It's a guest house of a mansion.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.490
But you're welcome to crash
on the couch if you need to.

03:45.681 --> 03:48.626
Yeah, thanks. But I am
determined to find a nice,

03:48.663 --> 03:51.572
clean, affordable place to live,
even if it kills me.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.363
It's not a mansion.

04:02.112 --> 04:03.915
Oh, no, Officer Nolan.

04:04.068 --> 04:06.314
You will be leading
roll call this morning.

04:06.983 --> 04:08.883
Sir?

04:08.980 --> 04:10.579
I didn't stutter. Get up there.

04:20.281 --> 04:23.124
- What now?
- The clipboard.

04:24.001 --> 04:27.375
Uh, "Memo to all divisions
from the Chief of Police."

04:27.626 --> 04:30.551
"Complaints about police officer
entitlement have risen sharply"

04:30.588 --> 04:33.895
"during the last few months..." Sir?

04:33.955 --> 04:37.120
Do you know what that means?
Police officer entitlement?

04:37.157 --> 04:40.067
I assume it has to do with
unauthorized perks.

04:40.104 --> 04:41.754
Free food, things of that nature.

04:41.791 --> 04:44.629
And what is LAPD's policy
on gratuities?

04:47.934 --> 04:51.676
No officer shall receive
any gratuity, gift, favor,

04:51.713 --> 04:54.067
or promise thereof,
as it may result in,

04:54.104 --> 04:57.224
or be perceived as, payment
in exchange for influence,

04:57.259 --> 05:00.897
bias, or direction of
an investigation or enforcement

05:00.934 --> 05:02.562
of punishable offenses.

05:03.105 --> 05:04.871
Nicely done.

05:05.631 --> 05:10.004
Chen, West, will you please join
Officer Nolan up front?

05:16.278 --> 05:19.168
Have your training officers
discussed this policy with you?

05:19.314 --> 05:21.331
- Yes, sir.
- And what was your takeaway?

05:21.413 --> 05:25.290
- Sir, if I may?
- Oh, sounds like a little CYA.

05:25.337 --> 05:27.203
No, sir. Boot and I walk

05:27.240 --> 05:28.560
the straight and narrow.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.507
But businesses like having cops around.

05:30.546 --> 05:32.259
A half-priced meal
every once in a while

05:32.294 --> 05:33.732
is just community relations.

05:33.827 --> 05:35.595
It doesn't mean we show them
favoritism.

05:35.631 --> 05:37.271
You agree with this, Officer Bishop?

05:37.350 --> 05:40.163
I'm not saying I've never
accepted a free cup of coffee,

05:40.200 --> 05:42.850
but it's usually the exception,
not the norm.

05:43.452 --> 05:45.391
What about you, Officer Nolan?

05:45.554 --> 05:47.225
I got into this job to help people,

05:47.262 --> 05:49.240
not to help myself to free stuff.

05:49.788 --> 05:51.744
Cute line. It's a bunch of bull, but...

05:53.380 --> 05:55.233
- It's not.
- Really?

05:55.289 --> 05:58.552
Do you pay fair market value for
that beach house you live in?

05:58.704 --> 06:00.539
No, sir. But I act as caretaker

06:00.576 --> 06:02.176
for the main house when Ben is away,

06:02.213 --> 06:04.801
so technically I am exchanging
services for my rent.

06:04.838 --> 06:07.940
And what happens when that
exchange isn't enough?

06:08.263 --> 06:10.934
And your buddy gets a ticket,
or... or worse?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.571
Then he'll have to pay for his actions.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.294
Okay.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.403
Favors are a slippery slope, people.

06:16.473 --> 06:17.910
And so are freebies.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.312
Look, I like to keep it real in here.

06:21.542 --> 06:24.381
There is the <i>letter</i> of the law
and there is the <i>spirit.</i>

06:24.491 --> 06:26.991
It is your jobs to know the difference.

06:27.215 --> 06:28.647
But make no mistake...

06:28.857 --> 06:32.184
as police officers, you have power.

06:32.390 --> 06:34.208
Usually we like to focus on the kind

06:34.245 --> 06:36.199
that you holster on your side,

06:36.691 --> 06:39.194
but the power that lives
within your badge

06:39.231 --> 06:41.327
can be equally as dangerous.

06:42.474 --> 06:45.227
That's it. All right, guys.
Be safe out there.

06:48.231 --> 06:51.232
<i>7-Adam-19, break-in
at Westside Fertility Clinic.</i>

06:51.315 --> 06:53.042
We haven't received a single freebie

06:53.079 --> 06:55.707
since I've been with you, so why
did you defend that to Grey?

06:55.742 --> 06:57.487
Because hard rules
like that are stupid.

06:57.573 --> 06:59.415
What we do doesn't exist in a vacuum.

06:59.522 --> 07:01.330
Circumstances dictate actions.

07:01.414 --> 07:03.108
Not the other way around.

07:03.337 --> 07:06.051
Police. Anyone here?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.883
Yes. We had a break-in.

07:08.939 --> 07:10.132
I can see that.

07:10.169 --> 07:12.457
There's been a rash of burglaries
in the neighborhood recently.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.848
Mostly addicts looking
for stuff to sell.

07:14.911 --> 07:17.778
This wasn't an addict.
They took embryos.

07:17.886 --> 07:19.161
That's a new one on me.

07:19.198 --> 07:22.669
Do I write this up as a
burglary or an abduction?

07:22.911 --> 07:24.736
You want to put out 50 Amber alerts?

07:24.771 --> 07:26.433
- It's a burglary.
- Officer,

07:26.497 --> 07:28.673
there's a crucial time element here.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.288
Without proper temperature control,

07:30.325 --> 07:31.991
those embryos will be compromised.

07:32.028 --> 07:33.358
Any idea who took them?

07:33.395 --> 07:35.741
They're part of an
ugly custody dispute.

07:35.983 --> 07:37.282
A lesbian couple.

07:37.358 --> 07:39.432
The eggs we harvested were
from only one of the women...

07:39.469 --> 07:40.753
Marilyn Tenni.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.011
Her ex is suing for custody rights

07:43.048 --> 07:45.462
even though she doesn't have
a biological connection.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.632
Okay, we're gonna need names
and addresses for both women.

07:47.674 --> 07:49.878
Of course. But you should know...

07:49.956 --> 07:54.164
when I called Marilyn to tell
her, she got very upset...

07:54.308 --> 07:56.241
said she was gonna kill her.

07:59.876 --> 08:01.355
License and registration, please.

08:01.392 --> 08:03.152
- Look, I don't have time for this.
- Look, no one does.

08:03.190 --> 08:04.590
But you blew through
that stop sign, so...

08:04.626 --> 08:06.590
Because Prince Charles is going to die.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.578
- Excuse me?
- My dog.

08:08.968 --> 08:10.366
He's a King Charles Cavalier

08:10.403 --> 08:12.108
and he just ate a whole bag
of macadamia nuts.

08:12.145 --> 08:13.750
Look, I'm sorry, but I still
have to write you up.

08:13.786 --> 08:16.225
You're kidding.
I'm racing him to the vet.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.621
They have to pump his stomach...
those nuts are toxic for dogs.

08:18.656 --> 08:20.417
Look, I understand, but this
will only take a minute.

08:20.453 --> 08:22.118
- License and registration, please.
- Oh.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.704
If he dies...

08:30.697 --> 08:33.499
I hope your dog's okay.
Have a nice day.

08:33.941 --> 08:35.152
Go to hell.

08:40.058 --> 08:43.047
Do you think a ticket was the
best resolution, Officer West?

08:43.121 --> 08:44.813
You heard Sergeant Grey this morning.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.711
We have to remain vigilant.

08:46.812 --> 08:48.669
If we let everyone who's in
a rush off the hook,

08:48.706 --> 08:51.033
- the city would be undrivable.
- Her dog is dying.

08:51.070 --> 08:52.350
A warning would have been sufficient.

08:52.386 --> 08:53.916
Okay, a dog that size would have to eat

08:53.953 --> 08:55.713
a pound of nuts to induce Ataxia.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.625
She drove through the stop sign
in a school zone.

08:57.661 --> 08:58.927
That's a pretty serious infraction.

08:58.963 --> 09:00.589
We blow stop signs all the time.

09:00.697 --> 09:03.074
And park on lawns. And drive on
the wrong side of the road.

09:03.111 --> 09:04.914
Okay, that... that's different.
We're cops.

09:04.951 --> 09:06.550
- We only do it when necessary.
- Exactly.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.371
Discretion is an important
part of this job.

09:08.387 --> 09:09.918
Even if the outcome is different

09:09.955 --> 09:11.364
than following the letter of the law.

09:11.401 --> 09:13.902
With all due respect,
I was raised differently.

09:14.194 --> 09:15.762
A law is a law.

09:16.562 --> 09:17.694
I can't believe you took...

09:17.730 --> 09:18.890
Those are mine!

09:18.927 --> 09:20.408
They are not yours! They're mine, too!

09:20.445 --> 09:22.374
Give them to me!
Give them to me right now!

09:22.411 --> 09:23.628
Don't you dare hit me again.

09:23.665 --> 09:25.338
- Listen, I said give them to me!
- I'll break these before I give them to you.

09:25.374 --> 09:26.669
LAPD. We're coming in.

09:26.705 --> 09:28.471
- Give them to me.
- They're mine too.

09:28.506 --> 09:30.026
- They are not.
- Hey, hey. Put down the weapon.

09:30.062 --> 09:32.373
Those are my embryos. She...
She stole them from the clinic.

09:32.410 --> 09:34.116
No, they are your eggs,

09:34.153 --> 09:36.659
and we had them fertilized by
a sperm donor together.

09:36.714 --> 09:38.597
- You remember?
- Yeah, and the judge ruled

09:38.634 --> 09:40.117
that I get to use them.
Do you remember that?

09:40.152 --> 09:41.706
Not if they're gone!

09:42.056 --> 09:43.956
Officer Chen, secure her.

09:44.077 --> 09:46.562
Ma'am, give me the tubes.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.066
- No.
- Please.

09:49.694 --> 09:54.257
Those... Those are my last
chance to carry my own baby.

09:54.866 --> 09:59.183
Please, don't take that from me.

09:59.603 --> 10:01.349
Please.

10:02.452 --> 10:04.351
We were supposed to have kids together.

10:05.517 --> 10:09.118
I saw you through
your whole cancer treatment.

10:09.513 --> 10:12.155
And then you dump me
for a yoga instructor?

10:12.220 --> 10:13.609
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.228
Listen to me.

10:15.619 --> 10:18.720
You're angry, okay?
You have every right to be.

10:19.054 --> 10:20.492
But doing this?

10:20.529 --> 10:24.093
It won't put your marriage
back together, okay?

10:24.128 --> 10:25.679
Nothing will.

10:27.098 --> 10:28.924
But you will come to hate yourself

10:28.961 --> 10:30.266
if you go through with this.

10:30.303 --> 10:32.969
So put the tubes
back in that container.

10:44.943 --> 10:47.115
<i>7-Adam-15, respond
to single-car accident.</i>

10:47.150 --> 10:48.617
<i>Fourth Street Overpass.</i>

10:48.677 --> 10:50.450
Do you think I'm compromised
living at Ben's house?

10:50.649 --> 10:51.815
Probably.

10:52.045 --> 10:53.455
You asked.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.524
Yeah, but I meant what I said
to Sergeant Grey.

10:55.559 --> 10:57.349
If he asked me for a favor, I'd say no.

10:57.386 --> 10:59.178
Okay, but why even put yourself
in that position?

10:59.215 --> 11:01.458
I-If it were me,
I'd have to pay my own way.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.760
Like a grown-up.

11:03.374 --> 11:04.695
Driver okay?

11:04.732 --> 11:06.300
He's been stabbed. Left side.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.357
Looks like he passed out, then
hit his head in the crash.

11:08.394 --> 11:10.094
- Any ID?
- Not that I can find.

11:10.131 --> 11:12.016
Control, I need you to run
the following plates...

11:12.053 --> 11:14.607
Five Frank Victor Alpha two seven.

11:14.644 --> 11:16.623
<i>Car registered to Matthew Rodriguez.</i>

11:16.660 --> 11:20.219
<i>- Date of birth... 7/7/1990.</i>
- Copy that.

11:20.256 --> 11:22.656
Send another unit to our
location for an accident report.

11:22.785 --> 11:25.303
It appears Mr. Rodriguez has
been the victim of an assault.

11:25.340 --> 11:26.920
We're accompanying RA to the hospital.

11:26.956 --> 11:28.951
- We'll follow you.
- Got it.

11:29.112 --> 11:31.146
That guy didn't get stabbed
driving alone.

11:31.183 --> 11:33.484
So either it happened
before he got in the car,

11:33.556 --> 11:36.178
or his attacker bolted
after the accident.

11:37.881 --> 11:39.240
I've got to admit...

11:39.277 --> 11:40.881
I thought there'd be more
mysteries on this job.

11:40.918 --> 11:42.252
Be happy there aren't.

11:42.289 --> 11:43.622
The unknown is a pain in the butt.

11:43.705 --> 11:45.271
Sure, but still, every once in a while

11:45.306 --> 11:47.107
you want a puzzle to solve.

11:50.701 --> 11:53.513
- Aah!
- 7-Adam-15, suspect...

11:53.568 --> 11:55.267
uh, victim... on foot.

11:55.304 --> 11:57.571
Fourth and Cesar Chavez. Southbound.

12:05.694 --> 12:09.461
Okay... now I really want
to know what happened.

12:14.009 --> 12:16.868
So our vehicle is registered
to Matthew Rodriguez,

12:16.905 --> 12:18.974
but our stabbing victim is <i>not</i>

12:19.011 --> 12:21.017
- Matthew Rodriguez.
- Hmm.

12:21.099 --> 12:24.501
Looks like Mr. Rodriguez has
a rap sheet with gang orders.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.716
- You know what those are?
- It means a judge ordered him

12:26.753 --> 12:28.827
not to associate with gang
members, wear their colors,

12:28.864 --> 12:29.864
or go to their neighborhood.

12:29.901 --> 12:31.406
Odds are a guy like that is connected

12:31.443 --> 12:32.849
to our John Doe stabbing.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.411
I thought officers
were supposed to avoid

12:34.446 --> 12:36.279
- making assumptions.
- There's a big difference

12:36.314 --> 12:38.727
between making an assumption
and a likely scenario.

12:38.915 --> 12:40.318
Which is? Oh, let me guess.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.519
When it comes from you,
it's a likely scenario.

12:42.664 --> 12:44.831
There's hope for you yet,
Officer Nolan.

12:45.173 --> 12:47.390
Now let's pay Mr. Rodriguez a visit,

12:47.426 --> 12:50.259
and see if he can shine some
light on our stabbing victim.

12:50.296 --> 12:53.071
<i>7-Adam-07, respond to
a false-imprisonment call.</i>

12:53.108 --> 12:54.641
<i>974 Ocampo Street.</i>

12:54.677 --> 12:56.030
Hi. Are you the manager?

12:56.067 --> 12:57.327
- Hey, get me out of here!
- Yes. Hi.

12:57.363 --> 12:59.280
Sir, we received a call
that one of your customers

12:59.317 --> 13:00.537
is being held against their will.

13:00.574 --> 13:02.472
He's not a customer.
He's a scam artist.

13:02.509 --> 13:03.815
- Excuse me?
- This guy,

13:03.852 --> 13:05.710
sets up first dates with women,

13:05.771 --> 13:08.172
runs up the bill, and then
sneaks out the back door.

13:08.209 --> 13:10.250
He's been doing it at restaurants
all over the neighborhood.

13:10.286 --> 13:11.819
He tried to do it to
that poor woman over there,

13:11.854 --> 13:13.314
but one of our kitchen staff caught him

13:13.351 --> 13:15.176
and locked his ass
in the walk-in fridge.

13:15.425 --> 13:17.425
Give us a minute.

13:22.112 --> 13:24.178
Seems like you're having
a pretty bad day.

13:24.293 --> 13:26.758
Tinder is like the clearance
rack at an outlet store.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.405
Dating apps are all bad.

13:28.504 --> 13:31.571
He ordered a $500 bottle
of wine for lunch.

13:31.607 --> 13:33.806
And then the charcuterie board.

13:33.842 --> 13:36.743
And a cheese plate.
And that steak Au poivre.

13:37.344 --> 13:40.847
And the bill is $680.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.403
I don't know how I'm
gonna cover my rent this month.

13:43.685 --> 13:45.712
Did you already order dessert?

13:46.172 --> 13:48.306
- No.
- Go ahead and get something.

13:48.490 --> 13:51.491
- Maybe two things.
- Why?

13:51.672 --> 13:53.567
Look, I know what you're doing.

13:54.008 --> 13:55.493
She bumps up the bill to $700,

13:55.530 --> 13:56.798
we can charge her date with a felony.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.055
Very good, Officer West.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.769
It's not our job to put
our thumb on the scale

13:59.806 --> 14:00.860
and change the outcome here.

14:00.897 --> 14:03.229
Are you lecturing me
on police work, Boot?

14:03.538 --> 14:05.471
- No. But it's still s...
- But nothing.

14:05.584 --> 14:07.417
Go hook up our dine-and-dasher.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.179
Definitely get the crème brûlée.

14:15.409 --> 14:17.120
Best crème brûlée in the city.

14:18.372 --> 14:21.006
Seriously?
You're totally fine with this?

14:21.222 --> 14:22.521
Susan isn't stuck paying the bill

14:22.557 --> 14:24.390
since the owners
can write it off as theft.

14:24.425 --> 14:25.858
The only person paying for the crime

14:25.894 --> 14:27.313
is this jerk who committed it.

14:27.441 --> 14:30.802
That's the spirit of law.
Now take a bite.

14:30.839 --> 14:32.167
No, I don't... I don't want it.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.965
Come on, get off your high horse
and try a little.

14:34.001 --> 14:36.335
No. Uh... I think it's...

14:36.370 --> 14:37.636
- Just...
- Mnh-mnh.

14:37.672 --> 14:39.338
Just a little bite.

14:43.324 --> 14:45.602
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm. Told you.

14:47.331 --> 14:49.331
Matthew Rodriguez, police. Open up.

14:49.733 --> 14:51.115
Nolan.

14:52.669 --> 14:54.069
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

15:00.194 --> 15:02.894
Well, I guess now we know
who stabbed our John Doe.

15:02.930 --> 15:04.996
- You sound disappointed.
- No, I just thought

15:05.032 --> 15:07.359
it might be a little less...
cut and dry.

15:07.396 --> 15:10.046
Well, believe me... cut and dry
is a lot less paperwork.

15:10.083 --> 15:14.218
7-Adam-15, we need a homicide
unit at 4495 Barrington.

15:14.255 --> 15:16.891
Our John Doe is now a murder suspect.

15:21.900 --> 15:23.504
You're not done yet?

15:23.541 --> 15:25.461
At this stage in training,
you should've knocked that out

15:25.497 --> 15:27.184
in two minutes. What's the problem?

15:27.213 --> 15:29.446
I'm... I'm not sure how to write it.

15:29.482 --> 15:31.548
It's a simple grand-theft report.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.651
It's not simple, all right?
We made that case a felony.

15:35.004 --> 15:36.444
Something that should've
been a citation,

15:36.480 --> 15:38.413
we turned into a weekend in jail.

15:38.810 --> 15:41.105
And you want me to lie on the report.

15:42.083 --> 15:45.062
I seem to remember writing
a report about you...

15:45.365 --> 15:47.364
second day on the job...

15:47.497 --> 15:50.800
"bent the truth" about your
cowardice in the line of fire.

15:51.326 --> 15:52.763
Ringing a bell?

15:52.912 --> 15:55.705
Yeah. And I'm grateful.

15:56.076 --> 15:58.509
- You know that. But I'm not...
- But what, Boot?

15:58.659 --> 16:00.932
More than any other rookie,
you should know the difference

16:00.969 --> 16:02.803
between the spirit and the letter.

16:02.953 --> 16:05.181
Unless you don't think
it applies to you.

16:05.497 --> 16:07.383
Are you the exception, Officer West?

16:07.477 --> 16:08.597
No, ma'am.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.555
Yet, here you are,
acting holier than thou.

16:11.878 --> 16:15.058
Tell me something...
do you carry a push knife?

16:15.281 --> 16:16.748
One of those fight-for-your-life,

16:16.785 --> 16:18.913
"last-resort,"
do-or-die kind of knives?

16:19.129 --> 16:22.174
You know that I do. I mean,
my... my dad gave it to me.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.646
Oh, right. Your father.

16:25.683 --> 16:29.439
Who all but walks on water...
only this knife is illegal.

16:29.474 --> 16:31.575
Yeah, right. I mean, half
the department carry these.

16:31.797 --> 16:35.078
Penal Code section 12-0-20.
At the very bottom.

16:35.509 --> 16:37.580
Technically it's a dagger.

16:38.107 --> 16:39.974
Look it up if you don't believe me.

16:41.915 --> 16:45.521
Look, if it's true, then
I just won't carry one anymore.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.257
That is the wrong lesson to learn here.

16:48.586 --> 16:50.516
You're in for a hard fall if
you can't see the difference

16:50.553 --> 16:52.394
between righteous and rigid.

16:53.293 --> 16:55.743
And if that wasn't the first
thing your father taught you,

16:55.826 --> 16:57.437
he failed you.

16:59.471 --> 17:02.634
Now fill out the damn report,
we've got to get back out there.

17:05.410 --> 17:07.376
It doesn't seem right
to lock up Marilyn, too.

17:07.412 --> 17:08.964
She was only trying
to protect her embryos.

17:09.001 --> 17:10.613
Nothing we can do.
She committed assault.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.482
Domestic-violence laws
are strict for a reason.

17:13.736 --> 17:16.384
What happened to
"circumstances dictate actions"?

17:16.420 --> 17:17.920
Trust me, this is one rule I'm all for.

17:18.186 --> 17:20.321
Cemeteries are filled with
women who'd still be alive

17:20.357 --> 17:22.124
if cops had been forced
to hook up their spouses

17:22.159 --> 17:23.659
the second he or she laid hands.

17:23.993 --> 17:26.895
That is a very enlightened attitude.

17:27.275 --> 17:28.465
You seem surprised.

17:28.502 --> 17:30.469
Sir, you surprise me every day.

17:30.661 --> 17:32.761
Uh-huh. Go gas up the shop.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.639
- Hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

17:36.674 --> 17:38.849
Yeah, it's been an interesting
morning. How about you?

17:38.886 --> 17:41.554
Same. I found a dead body
at the Langston on Wilshire.

17:41.863 --> 17:43.521
- How was it?
- Uh, gruesome.

17:43.558 --> 17:45.147
Guy took a bullet right to his, uh...

17:45.182 --> 17:46.948
Oh, wait. Not the body. The apartment.

17:47.481 --> 17:49.558
Oh... uh, it was nice.

17:49.595 --> 17:51.957
Surprisingly upscale for a gang member.

17:51.994 --> 17:53.921
Are you asking for you?

17:54.099 --> 17:56.358
Well, the building needs to
disclose if someone was killed

17:56.393 --> 17:59.308
in the apartment, so it might
mean a break in rent.

17:59.347 --> 18:01.238
Yeah, just a bit of a questionable way

18:01.275 --> 18:02.747
to find a place to live, no?

18:02.784 --> 18:05.700
Yeah, well, traditional clearly
isn't working out, so...

18:05.805 --> 18:08.050
Let's go, Boot.
Captain wants to see us.

18:10.909 --> 18:13.207
That should hold you
until you get to the hospital.

18:13.503 --> 18:15.509
- Captain.
- What's going on?

18:17.814 --> 18:19.106
That's our murder suspect.

18:19.143 --> 18:20.691
He's not a suspect, Officer Nolan.

18:20.769 --> 18:22.349
He's an undercover narcotics detective.

18:22.447 --> 18:23.947
Robert Ortiz.

18:24.232 --> 18:26.132
I'm sorry about the ambulance thing.

18:30.616 --> 18:33.765
I've been undercover inside
La Eme for almost a year.

18:33.789 --> 18:36.015
Working my way closer to
the offshoot in Boyle Heights

18:36.052 --> 18:37.218
called <i> Ocampo Loco.</i>

18:37.255 --> 18:39.622
They control the cash flow
and then bundle the drug money

18:39.659 --> 18:40.943
and ship it back to Mexico.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.292
How much money are we talking?

18:42.357 --> 18:44.363
Right now, at least a million.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.278
The word is they're gonna
ship it tonight.

18:46.315 --> 18:48.224
I was about to report it
when my cover was blown

18:48.261 --> 18:50.565
by, uh, Matthew Rodriguez,
who tried to kill me,

18:50.602 --> 18:52.468
so I shot him in self-defense.

18:52.505 --> 18:54.061
Uh, you know the rest.

18:54.098 --> 18:56.841
Officer Ortiz has bravely
volunteered to go back in

18:56.915 --> 18:59.516
to protect his cover and set up
our tactical operation.

18:59.553 --> 19:02.354
Last time I was at the house,
it was four <i> halcones</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:04.391
guarding the money. Heavy-hitters.

19:04.428 --> 19:05.727
We're gonna gear up heavy,

19:05.764 --> 19:07.485
position ourselves down the street,

19:07.717 --> 19:09.631
be ready to initiate a full-blown raid

19:09.668 --> 19:11.702
on the house once Ortiz
gives us the signal.

19:11.772 --> 19:15.561
Rookies, this is your first
high-level tactical operation.

19:15.881 --> 19:17.534
Let's be prepared.

19:18.053 --> 19:19.428
Did you read the search warrant?

19:19.465 --> 19:21.851
Yes, ma'am. 8531 Winchester Boulevard.

19:21.888 --> 19:23.429
Residence is a 1800s Victorian

19:23.466 --> 19:25.021
with five bedrooms and two bathrooms.

19:25.058 --> 19:26.747
- And a guest house.
- Front door?

19:26.784 --> 19:29.238
Solid oak with a copper handle
on the right side.

19:31.231 --> 19:33.142
You know the specs of this
equipment, Officer Chen?

19:33.178 --> 19:35.968
That's a Blackhawk Dynamic
Entry Special Op Ram.

19:37.348 --> 19:39.148
- How much does it weigh?
- 60 pounds, sir.

19:39.184 --> 19:40.917
Hold it tight. You'll be the breacher.

19:40.952 --> 19:42.506
You'll buy a round
for every swing it takes

19:42.543 --> 19:44.288
to knock that door down.

19:44.406 --> 19:46.440
Walk me through a tactical-gear check.

19:46.569 --> 19:48.969
Stock zip ties in
the loops of the tac vest.

19:49.059 --> 19:51.577
- And then?
- Secure any loose gear...

19:51.614 --> 19:53.559
tac vest, helmet, et cetera.

19:53.608 --> 19:55.408
Finally, secure firearm to thigh rig.

19:55.499 --> 19:57.997
Very good. Any questions?

19:58.894 --> 20:00.316
What if I have to pee?

20:01.339 --> 20:02.971
I'll hold it. I'm good.

20:07.656 --> 20:09.218
All units, we're 30 seconds out.

20:09.255 --> 20:11.054
Get ready. Be safe.

20:16.968 --> 20:21.307
Officer West, you do the 844.
Stand by to initiate.

20:23.072 --> 20:24.504
Ortiz is in.

20:24.786 --> 20:25.998
<i>Where the hell you been?</i>

20:26.035 --> 20:27.435
<i>Rodriguez was talkin' to the cops.</i>

20:27.471 --> 20:29.131
<i>He tried to stick me
when I called him out.</i>

20:29.166 --> 20:30.453
<i>So I put a bullet in his head.</i>

20:30.490 --> 20:31.593
<i>We got to get out of here.</i>

20:31.630 --> 20:33.870
<i>- He could've given this place up.
- How the hell are we gonna do that?</i>

20:33.948 --> 20:35.550
<i>We've got a million in cash
waiting for pick-up.</i>

20:35.587 --> 20:37.338
<i>- Pack it up.
- It's too hot to stay here.</i>

20:37.374 --> 20:39.225
That's the signal. Initiate.

21:01.579 --> 21:03.434
Police! Open the door!

21:03.471 --> 21:05.005
We have a search warrant.

21:07.662 --> 21:09.703
- Suspect ran into the back.
- Open door to the right.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.440
LAPD!

21:11.689 --> 21:14.023
Open door. Get away from that window.

21:14.058 --> 21:15.725
Show me your hands.

21:17.895 --> 21:19.315
Step back or I'll shoot.

21:19.352 --> 21:20.665
Get down on your knees <i> now.</i>

21:20.788 --> 21:22.127
Clear!

21:22.190 --> 21:23.557
- You good?
- Yeah.

21:23.594 --> 21:25.580
Hands up. Fingers behind your head.

21:25.612 --> 21:27.987
Do it now. Back up.

21:28.985 --> 21:32.219
Hands up! Interlace your
fingertips behind your head.

21:34.151 --> 21:36.118
- You okay?
- Yeah. Barely.

21:36.254 --> 21:37.966
We'll divert to the hospital
on the way out.

21:38.493 --> 21:40.724
Clear! Coming out!

21:44.031 --> 21:46.597
Rookies... special assignment.

21:46.632 --> 21:47.953
Follow me.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.899
Sorry. Here's what happens now.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.125
You see, the money
counters and the videographer

21:57.160 --> 21:58.475
are on their way.

21:58.537 --> 22:00.910
In the meantime, you three
get to watch the money.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.912
Two people with it at all times.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.280
No selfies.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.537
Enjoy.

22:11.956 --> 22:14.077
Where does all this money go?

22:14.150 --> 22:16.580
Cash seized during drug raids
goes back to Narcotics,

22:16.617 --> 22:18.924
where it's used again
for undercover ops.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.931
That's more money than I've
ever seen in one place.

22:22.025 --> 22:24.018
Can you imagine?

22:24.836 --> 22:28.721
I'd buy a car... no, a helicopter.

22:28.769 --> 22:31.306
And learn to fly it so I could
avoid all the traffic.

22:31.361 --> 22:34.195
Yeah, that first big purchase
is always tricky, right?

22:34.378 --> 22:35.932
The barber in Foxburg?

22:35.994 --> 22:38.428
He won the lottery.
Bought a big, fancy boat.

22:38.471 --> 22:41.683
Ran it aground in Freeport,
coked to the gills.

22:41.718 --> 22:43.190
I don't think a boat is a good idea.

22:43.227 --> 22:45.193
What about you?
What would you spend it on?

22:45.230 --> 22:47.944
I'm not playing that game.
This is drug money.

22:48.069 --> 22:49.405
Come on. We're just talking.

22:49.442 --> 22:52.209
A million dollars
lands on your doorstep.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.575
What do you do? Go.

22:53.612 --> 22:56.213
And don't say you'd set aside
30% for taxes.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.233
Um... A new car, I guess.

22:59.270 --> 23:01.906
Um, or maybe a trip.

23:02.312 --> 23:03.592
Been wanting to do a little traveling.

23:03.707 --> 23:05.030
Let me guess.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.676
You'd visit police departments
all around the world.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.457
Learn their techniques.

23:09.528 --> 23:10.895
No.

23:15.374 --> 23:18.396
I'd pay all of Henry's
tuition with the money.

23:18.433 --> 23:19.933
Just so he didn't have
those student loans

23:19.970 --> 23:23.338
- hanging over his head.
- Yeah, they're no fun.

23:23.498 --> 23:25.894
I'll be paying mine off until I'm 60.

23:25.929 --> 23:28.566
Yeah, well, with this money,
you could pay them all off

23:28.603 --> 23:31.517
and still rent an amazing place
by the ocean.

23:31.728 --> 23:33.603
Meanwhile, I couldn't afford
to buy the room

23:33.640 --> 23:34.931
in the house I'm living in.

23:34.968 --> 23:36.528
Bet it would have got you
something pretty nice

23:36.564 --> 23:38.032
- back in Foxburg, though.
- Hmm.

23:38.126 --> 23:40.791
Biggest house in town and then some.

23:40.932 --> 23:43.134
Still can't get used to the cost
of living in Los Angeles.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.473
It's like you have to add
an extra zero to everything.

23:45.518 --> 23:47.585
You know, I never really thought
about money growing up.

23:47.770 --> 23:49.717
We always just had enough, you know?

23:49.871 --> 23:52.363
Yeah. That's what I thought

23:52.521 --> 23:55.923
until my parents went bankrupt
when I was nine.

23:56.259 --> 23:57.758
It took a couple of really bad years

23:57.793 --> 23:59.426
before we got back up on our feet.

23:59.461 --> 24:01.049
Ah, been there.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.878
Definitely been days

24:02.915 --> 24:04.748
where I would have killed
to be sitting across

24:04.785 --> 24:07.753
from this much money,
there for the taking.

24:07.848 --> 24:09.848
Hey, don't even joke about that.

24:09.939 --> 24:11.939
I've heard too many stories
from my dad about cops

24:11.974 --> 24:13.420
who started filling their pockets,

24:13.483 --> 24:15.634
convincing themselves that
it was a victimless crime,

24:15.671 --> 24:17.242
that they were entitled to a little

24:17.279 --> 24:19.117
extra compensation for their troubles.

24:19.154 --> 24:20.660
Okay. Well, relax.

24:20.746 --> 24:21.802
That's not us.

24:21.839 --> 24:23.359
Yeah, that's what they
thought at first, too.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.062
But then you take a bite
of the crème brûlée,

24:25.099 --> 24:27.212
and the next thing you know,
you're doing three to five

24:27.249 --> 24:28.500
for felony theft.

24:28.572 --> 24:30.815
I'm sorry. Crème brûlée?

24:31.120 --> 24:33.354
- Never mind.
- Oh, man.

24:33.521 --> 24:34.959
- What?
- I just...

24:34.996 --> 24:37.235
I still have to pee, but all this...

24:38.466 --> 24:40.890
I'll be right back.

24:43.664 --> 24:45.497
- All done?
- Just finished.

24:45.534 --> 24:46.605
Bad guys on the way to jail,

24:46.641 --> 24:47.958
Ortiz on his way to the hospital.

24:47.995 --> 24:49.667
- So we're headed out.
- You're not waiting for us?

24:49.704 --> 24:51.669
Nope. But we're leaving a shop behind.

24:51.706 --> 24:54.040
Remember... shift starts
tomorrow at noon,

24:54.108 --> 24:55.908
but you want to get in early
to do tonight's paperwork.

24:55.944 --> 24:58.884
Copy that. Are the money
counters gonna get here soon?

24:58.919 --> 25:00.538
I'd get comfortable if I were you.

25:00.602 --> 25:02.754
Those guys work at their own pace.

25:02.790 --> 25:05.778
Copy that. Oh, where's the...

25:13.328 --> 25:15.294
I'd still do the job.

25:16.236 --> 25:18.163
Even if I came into money.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.491
That's not a shock.

25:20.675 --> 25:23.974
You know, I would, too.

25:24.221 --> 25:26.197
You've known what you
wanted to do since birth,

25:26.234 --> 25:28.301
but I just figured out.

25:28.372 --> 25:30.973
There's no way I would bail now.

25:31.285 --> 25:33.030
What about you?

25:33.718 --> 25:36.775
Having money makes things
easier, not better.

25:36.856 --> 25:38.840
That's not an answer.

25:39.259 --> 25:40.627
Would you quit the job?

25:40.664 --> 25:43.431
And pass up on being hazed
on a daily basis

25:43.468 --> 25:45.201
by training officers
ten years my junior?

25:45.398 --> 25:46.831
Come on.

25:55.392 --> 25:56.619
All right.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.267
Officers Graser and Williams
arriving on the scene.

25:59.304 --> 26:01.670
13:17 a.m. relieving three
uniformed officers.

26:02.047 --> 26:04.385
- What are your names?
- Nolan, Chen, West.

26:04.424 --> 26:05.908
Anyone else that's come in or out?

26:05.945 --> 26:07.512
- No, ma'am.
- Great.

26:08.754 --> 26:10.787
Hit the road. We got it from here.

26:15.060 --> 26:16.663
You coming?

26:17.264 --> 26:19.998
We might never see
this much money again.

26:20.236 --> 26:23.069
If there's ever another raid
and they need someone to sit

26:23.106 --> 26:26.542
and wait until the wee hours,
I have a feeling it will be us.

26:32.421 --> 26:34.252
Nolan, wake up!

26:34.554 --> 26:36.043
Nolan!

26:36.459 --> 26:37.858
Nolan!

26:47.226 --> 26:48.924
Did I oversleep? Shift starts at noon.

26:48.959 --> 26:50.351
Captain called me
to bring you in early.

26:50.388 --> 26:51.754
- Why?
- She didn't say.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.538
- That sounds bad.
- It's not good.

26:53.575 --> 26:55.648
- Do I have time to...
- Get dressed.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.281
What's going on?

27:00.335 --> 27:02.568
They told us to gather
our Boots, same as you.

27:03.624 --> 27:05.023
We have a situation.

27:05.356 --> 27:08.671
Money counters are telling us
that we're missing $250,000.

27:08.830 --> 27:11.531
And you three were the only ones
left alone with the money.

27:18.015 --> 27:20.096
Well, the money counters
must have made a mistake.

27:20.133 --> 27:23.015
There's video of them entering
the garage and relieving you.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.783
And then they counted the money

27:24.851 --> 27:27.202
and got $750,000, and not a million.

27:27.226 --> 27:29.420
Let me remind you, an officer
was recently convicted

27:29.457 --> 27:31.190
of third-degree official misconduct

27:31.241 --> 27:33.101
for taking $70 from a crime scene.

27:33.268 --> 27:35.070
He's serving two years behind bars.

27:35.111 --> 27:36.433
What do you think would happen to a cop

27:36.469 --> 27:37.847
who steals a quarter-million dollars?

27:37.884 --> 27:39.056
But we didn't take it.

27:39.093 --> 27:41.657
Uh, maybe the assumption was wrong.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.026
Maybe it was always $750,000.

27:43.063 --> 27:44.608
That's not what the Intel shows.

27:44.838 --> 27:46.210
Guy's on the wire
saying it's a million.

27:46.245 --> 27:48.312
Okay, well, we can all
vouch for each other.

27:48.347 --> 27:49.822
- I mean...
- Not good enough.

27:49.859 --> 27:52.316
The only thing that will clear
you is passing a polygraph.

27:52.351 --> 27:54.618
Now, I can't, by law,
make you take one.

27:54.742 --> 27:56.420
It would have to be strictly voluntary.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.614
- What if we decline?
- It's grounds for suspension,

27:58.651 --> 28:00.151
pending an investigation,

28:00.188 --> 28:02.151
and possibly could lead
to your termination.

28:02.188 --> 28:06.671
Well, that's...
not much of a choice, but...

28:07.893 --> 28:10.980
- Yeah, we'll do it.
- Okay. Let's go.

28:11.302 --> 28:13.214
- What, now?
- Now.

28:20.776 --> 28:22.723
You think one of them
really could have done it?

28:22.760 --> 28:23.843
Not by themselves.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.356
Nolan came back into the
house to use the bathroom.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.170
One of the other two could have
hidden some of the money then.

28:29.287 --> 28:31.085
Came back, picked it up later.

28:31.122 --> 28:32.513
There's no way West participated.

28:32.550 --> 28:34.622
- That kid is squeaky clean.
- Well, if it was Chen,

28:34.659 --> 28:37.326
- she wouldn't get caught like this.
- Sounds like a compliment.

28:37.596 --> 28:39.162
I'm just saying
she's smarter than that.

28:39.237 --> 28:40.800
It doesn't matter if
they did it or not.

28:40.837 --> 28:42.873
If they don't walk out of there
with a flawless polygraph,

28:42.910 --> 28:44.471
they're done.

28:48.823 --> 28:50.338
What am I sitting on?

28:50.374 --> 28:53.026
A pressure pad that registers

28:53.104 --> 28:54.977
if you attempt to try
to cheat the polygraph

28:55.221 --> 28:56.979
by clenching your buttocks.

28:57.315 --> 28:59.499
Well, that can't be a real thing.

28:59.717 --> 29:02.851
- You just clenched.
- Really?

29:03.113 --> 29:04.679
What am I doing now?

29:05.723 --> 29:08.791
Officer West,
you seem... uncomfortable.

29:09.037 --> 29:10.717
Is there something you'd
like to get off your chest

29:10.753 --> 29:13.976
- before we begin?
- Yes.

29:14.198 --> 29:17.399
I, um... I had a bite
of crème brûlée, okay?

29:17.450 --> 29:19.215
And, yes, it was delicious.

29:19.370 --> 29:20.865
Like, I-I-I know it was wrong,

29:20.902 --> 29:22.683
but now that taste is in my mouth.

29:22.730 --> 29:25.873
That sweet flavor
of corruption is just...

29:26.378 --> 29:29.376
but I want to let you guys know
that I've learned my lesson.

29:29.459 --> 29:31.382
And it will never happen again.

29:33.316 --> 29:36.348
Okay. Let's begin with a few
control questions.

29:36.586 --> 29:38.385
Answer with a simple yes or no.

29:38.525 --> 29:41.081
- Is your name Jonathan Nolan?
- Yes.

29:41.118 --> 29:45.727
Do you live at 7214 and 1/2
Alvarado Street, apartment F?

29:45.762 --> 29:48.362
- For the moment.
- A simple yes or no, Officer.

29:48.636 --> 29:50.264
Sorry. Um, yes.

29:50.423 --> 29:51.733
Are your eyes brown?

29:51.768 --> 29:54.119
Um, well, m-my mom always says

29:54.156 --> 29:56.957
they're more of a dark chestnut, but...

29:58.540 --> 30:01.574
- Brown is fine.
- Did you witness anyone taking money?

30:01.610 --> 30:03.543
- No.
- Were you ever alone with the money?

30:03.578 --> 30:06.747
Yes, sir. N-No... No, sir. No.

30:08.047 --> 30:09.382
Look, I'm sorry.

30:09.417 --> 30:11.551
These... These wires make me
really nervous, like...

30:13.611 --> 30:15.711
Have you ever lied to
protect another officer?

30:15.848 --> 30:17.296
No.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.794
Let's try that again.

30:20.909 --> 30:24.700
Have you ever
lied to protect a fellow officer?

30:25.769 --> 30:26.967
Yes.

30:27.136 --> 30:28.568
Regarding the missing money?

30:28.900 --> 30:30.200
No, ma'am.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.797
Why did you tell them
about crème brûlée?

30:34.842 --> 30:36.273
I don't know. It came up naturally.

30:36.325 --> 30:37.680
They were yes or no questions.

30:37.717 --> 30:39.851
How does crème brûlée
come up naturally?

30:40.062 --> 30:43.330
Boots, you've all passed
your polygraphs.

30:43.499 --> 30:45.980
But this is far from over. Go home.

30:46.108 --> 30:48.642
Detectives will contact you soon
about follow-up interviews.

30:48.733 --> 30:50.213
We got to find out what
happened to that money

30:50.249 --> 30:51.809
- before you hit the street again.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:51.874 --> 30:53.221
Thank you.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.148
Hey.

30:55.185 --> 30:57.812
You know what I like to do after
I've been suspected of a felony?

30:57.849 --> 30:59.945
- Uh, drink?
- Damn straight. I got a stocked fridge.

30:59.982 --> 31:01.352
- Anyone want to join?
- I'm down.

31:01.389 --> 31:03.062
- Lucy?
- Yeah, it's barely lunch,

31:03.099 --> 31:04.742
and I should make use of the time off

31:04.779 --> 31:06.152
and go apartment hunting.

31:06.188 --> 31:07.454
You okay?

31:07.849 --> 31:09.790
Why would I be?

31:13.659 --> 31:15.077
Hey.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.553
- We all got cleared.
- You're cops.

31:17.590 --> 31:19.598
We supposed to be impressed
you're not criminals?

31:19.649 --> 31:22.183
- No... No, sir.
- Part of the job description, really.

31:22.437 --> 31:24.583
And you won't be cleared
until the money's found,

31:24.882 --> 31:26.975
but we'll do our best
to try and find it.

31:30.030 --> 31:31.749
You know, Talia's right.

31:31.812 --> 31:33.350
They don't catch who stole that money,

31:33.387 --> 31:34.764
cops are gonna think we did it,

31:34.803 --> 31:36.186
no matter what the polygraph said.

31:36.223 --> 31:37.484
We'll never be trusted again.

31:37.519 --> 31:38.918
Yeah, you're not wrong.

31:39.092 --> 31:40.316
So what do we do?

31:42.378 --> 31:44.311
Hey, Lucy.
You're on with me and Jackson.

31:44.426 --> 31:47.160
You know, if they don't find
the money, we're screwed.

31:47.195 --> 31:48.779
<i>We were just talking about that.</i>

31:48.816 --> 31:50.404
<i>I keep going over it in my mind.</i>

31:50.441 --> 31:53.090
The only thing I can think of
is that money was gone

31:53.127 --> 31:55.340
long before we ever got to the garage.

31:56.471 --> 31:59.148
- What the hell is this guy doing?
<i>- Wait. What?</i>

31:59.185 --> 32:01.709
This black SUV... he's riding my ass.

32:03.126 --> 32:05.759
He just hit me!

32:05.796 --> 32:07.940
<i>He looks like he's trying
to run me off the road!</i>

32:07.977 --> 32:09.082
- Where are you?
- Uh,

32:09.119 --> 32:10.878
driving south on Griffith Park Drive.

32:10.915 --> 32:13.249
I just passed Mineral Wells Trail.

32:18.589 --> 32:19.822
Lucy?

32:39.437 --> 32:41.070
Bishop, Lucy's in trouble.

32:41.186 --> 32:43.663
Someone tried to drive her off
the road, Griffith Park Drive.

32:43.710 --> 32:45.475
Jackson and I are on our way there now.

32:54.267 --> 32:55.985
Okay, two left.

33:18.373 --> 33:19.862
Clear.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.640
Phone's in the car.

33:21.677 --> 33:24.015
Officer needs help,
requesting backup and airship.

33:24.054 --> 33:25.787
- Van's clear.
- Griffith Park Drive.

33:25.824 --> 33:28.024
Be advised... plain-clothed
officers in pursuit,

33:28.140 --> 33:29.584
heading northwest into the woods.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.337
<i>7-Adam-19, we're five minutes out.</i>

33:31.374 --> 33:32.920
<i>Hold until we get there.</i>

33:49.468 --> 33:50.866
Which way?

33:50.960 --> 33:52.302
I don't know.

33:54.220 --> 33:55.519
You seeing that?

33:55.571 --> 33:57.004
Yeah.

34:00.427 --> 34:02.224
- That way.
- You sure?

34:02.261 --> 34:03.708
No.

34:20.002 --> 34:22.263
Drop the gun.

34:27.536 --> 34:28.809
What do you want?

34:28.947 --> 34:30.629
The money you stole.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.411
Wait. You're with La Eme?

34:34.482 --> 34:36.114
And you're with the LAPD,

34:36.152 --> 34:37.596
Officer Lucy Chen,

34:37.674 --> 34:41.596
who lives at 7214 and 1/2
Alvarado Street, apartment F.

34:41.632 --> 34:43.855
- How do you know all that?
- Public records.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.237
Addresses, police reports.

34:46.274 --> 34:47.885
Damn near everything's on the net.

34:47.922 --> 34:50.722
So I already know that you were
guarding our money.

34:50.811 --> 34:52.877
And 250 G's went missing.

34:52.914 --> 34:54.251
And I know you're the cop that took it.

34:54.288 --> 34:57.336
- I-I didn't steal anything.
- No.

34:57.373 --> 34:59.472
Please. We've seen your place.

34:59.546 --> 35:01.146
Ran your credit.

35:01.237 --> 35:03.489
You need a serious cash infusion.

35:03.915 --> 35:07.429
So where's our money?

35:07.483 --> 35:10.217
I already told you, I don't have it.

35:10.722 --> 35:12.187
Tough girl, huh?

35:12.224 --> 35:15.388
Well, everybody's tough at
first, until they're not.

35:15.679 --> 35:17.286
Andres.

35:18.071 --> 35:19.905
Cut her up a little.

35:27.401 --> 35:29.337
This isn't about the money, chica.

35:29.451 --> 35:32.118
A quarter million is a rounding
error on our gas budget.

35:32.317 --> 35:34.436
This is about sending a message.

35:34.579 --> 35:36.035
You can't steal from us.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.776
Even if you carry a badge.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.333
- I saw you.
- What?

35:42.370 --> 35:44.703
Outside the house,
right before we raided it.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.008
You were wearing those boots
and carrying that duffel bag

35:47.045 --> 35:48.477
with the red stripe.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.814
Somebody tipped you off about the raid.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.559
You took the money.

35:52.676 --> 35:54.040
You got in before we hit the place.

35:54.077 --> 35:55.723
You thought no one would notice.

36:03.353 --> 36:05.811
Shots fired northwest
from our previous.

36:06.356 --> 36:08.990
Damn it! Aah!

36:12.578 --> 36:14.139
You messed it all up.

36:20.669 --> 36:22.098
Hey!

36:23.239 --> 36:24.305
Police! Don't move!

36:26.369 --> 36:27.734
Aah!

36:30.145 --> 36:31.764
Do not move!

36:31.905 --> 36:34.124
Stay on the ground!

36:35.483 --> 36:36.883
You got this?

36:36.919 --> 36:38.184
I'm going after Lucy.

36:40.522 --> 36:43.156
Aah!

36:50.716 --> 36:52.165
- Nice.
- Do you have cuffs?

36:52.200 --> 36:54.282
Yeah. Last pair.

36:55.934 --> 36:57.237
What took you so long?

37:13.087 --> 37:15.798
Paramedics are taking our
other suspect to Shaw Memorial.

37:15.822 --> 37:17.933
Homicide's working
the <i>halcón</i> this one killed.

37:17.970 --> 37:19.533
And the missing $250,000?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.470
Einstein here had it stacked
on his coffee table.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.111
West and Lopez are bringing it in now.

37:23.148 --> 37:24.700
All right. Good work.

37:26.429 --> 37:28.844
- And how are you doing?
- Oh, good. Thank you.

37:28.881 --> 37:30.202
I think I might
have twisted my ankle...

37:30.238 --> 37:31.960
I meant Officer Chen, Nolan.

37:33.534 --> 37:35.525
- That was good work out there.
- Thank you, sir.

37:35.562 --> 37:37.421
I'm just relieved that
we found the missing money.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.557
So I take it we're off
the hook about the cash?

37:39.809 --> 37:41.141
You are.

37:41.194 --> 37:42.638
But to be clear,

37:42.728 --> 37:44.507
at no point did anyone actually believe

37:44.544 --> 37:47.695
that three rookies knew how to
smuggle a quarter mil in cash

37:47.732 --> 37:49.165
out of a crime scene.

37:49.654 --> 37:51.587
But good work.

37:57.209 --> 37:58.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:59.015 --> 38:02.650
Um, look. In case I haven't
said this enough,

38:02.747 --> 38:06.255
I, uh... I've been training
to be a cop my whole life.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.116
I walked in here thinking I knew
everything about everything,

38:09.153 --> 38:12.155
and I can only imagine
how annoying that's been.

38:12.228 --> 38:13.517
I wouldn't call it annoying.

38:13.554 --> 38:16.486
I'd call it... yeah, no,
annoying's about right.

38:16.523 --> 38:19.023
Well, I'm sorry.

38:19.125 --> 38:21.631
You're my T.O., not my dad.

38:21.921 --> 38:23.699
I should let you let teach me
how to be a cop.

38:24.007 --> 38:25.735
Even if some of your methods
contradict the things

38:25.770 --> 38:27.689
that he showed me, but...

38:27.839 --> 38:29.345
look, I just hope
that you'll understand

38:29.382 --> 38:31.707
if I need to take a moment to adjust.

38:32.218 --> 38:33.909
I guess I can give you that.

38:34.031 --> 38:35.681
Thank you.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.630
And thanks for not giving up on me.

38:37.782 --> 38:40.040
I wouldn't be here without you, and...

38:41.092 --> 38:42.883
I'll never forget that again.

38:49.813 --> 38:51.438
This a good time?

38:51.540 --> 38:53.228
Of course. Come in, Captain.

38:53.454 --> 38:55.373
I wanted to see how you were doing.

38:56.204 --> 38:57.728
All-you-can-eat pudding.

38:57.849 --> 38:59.515
The only highlight of
being in a hospital.

38:59.637 --> 39:02.070
Do you want one?

39:02.105 --> 39:04.371
Oh, no, no. You enjoy.

39:05.478 --> 39:08.109
Hey, uh, I thought you'd like to know.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.564
We recovered the missing
quarter million.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.825
Wow.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.631
That's really good news.

39:14.751 --> 39:16.648
Turns out it was gone
before we even showed up.

39:16.820 --> 39:19.954
Gang member Franco DeSantis
took it just before our raid.

39:20.253 --> 39:21.890
We pulled his cell records.

39:22.008 --> 39:23.586
Turns out there was an incoming call

39:23.623 --> 39:25.956
just before he grabbed the cash
and walked it out the door.

39:26.628 --> 39:28.930
Do you know where that call came from?

39:29.678 --> 39:30.819
Mnh-mnh.

39:30.856 --> 39:32.321
I have no idea.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.868
The station.

39:38.686 --> 39:40.742
And you think I-I-I-I made it.

39:40.777 --> 39:42.362
Oh, I know you did.

39:42.977 --> 39:45.714
You see, Franco admitted as much.

39:47.435 --> 39:49.481
Tch, tch, tch. Don't.

39:49.853 --> 39:51.786
You should enjoy your pudding.

39:53.171 --> 39:54.640
The stuff they give you in prison?

39:54.677 --> 39:56.442
Whew. Not nearly as good.

40:02.387 --> 40:04.726
Hey.

40:04.763 --> 40:06.483
- Hey.
- Come in, come in, come in.

40:06.519 --> 40:07.731
Ah!

40:07.832 --> 40:11.956
So, this is my new place.
It's great, right?

40:12.005 --> 40:15.640
Oh, um, there's a giant
bloodstain on the rug.

40:15.675 --> 40:18.961
Which is how I'm getting 25% off
for the first year.

40:19.846 --> 40:21.444
Are you sure that's
not because you're a cop?

40:21.481 --> 40:24.360
Yeah. He didn't even know
before he cut me the break.

40:24.451 --> 40:27.082
Landlord was super eager
to get it all done,

40:27.119 --> 40:29.605
especially because I said
I would take it as is.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.048
As is?

40:31.087 --> 40:32.494
Uh, you mean that...

40:32.556 --> 40:35.845
Oh, yeah. Which is why you're here.

40:35.927 --> 40:38.038
You see, friends...

40:39.103 --> 40:42.356
help friends clean up crime scenes.

40:44.293 --> 40:46.326
We'll get <i> Poke</i> after.

40:46.564 --> 40:48.972
- Okay.
- Thank you.

40:50.369 --> 40:52.967
So what should we drink to?

40:53.640 --> 40:55.077
To paying your own way.

40:55.144 --> 40:57.053
That's strangely specific.

40:57.116 --> 41:00.317
Listen, I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

41:00.452 --> 41:02.639
You really helped me
get back on my feet.

41:02.725 --> 41:04.020
But I'm back on them now,

41:04.055 --> 41:07.324
and I can't just keep
living here for free.

41:08.075 --> 41:10.591
- I don't need you to pay rent.
<i>- I</i> need me to pay rent,

41:10.669 --> 41:13.363
so what would you list this place for?

41:13.512 --> 41:16.700
Oh. Oof. I don't know. Twelve.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.368
Maybe eleven?

41:18.404 --> 41:19.968
How about we'll just
call it $10,000 even?

41:20.004 --> 41:22.971
A month? I-I-I can't afford that.

41:23.077 --> 41:24.309
I'll tell you what.

41:24.606 --> 41:26.375
Why don't you pay what you can afford,

41:26.699 --> 41:27.998
and we'll call it even?

41:28.137 --> 41:29.845
Thank you. Deal.

41:34.426 --> 41:36.385
And I have to tell you...
oh, my God, that's good.

41:36.421 --> 41:39.254
But I have to be clear.

41:39.955 --> 41:43.325
As a cop, I can't do you any favors.

41:43.362 --> 41:45.237
I can't fix a ticket for you.

41:45.274 --> 41:47.896
I-I can't help you out
of any legal jeopardy.

41:47.932 --> 41:50.833
I-I just hope you understand.

41:50.991 --> 41:52.602
Totally. And you know what?

41:52.664 --> 41:55.060
I would never come to you
for anything like that.

41:56.294 --> 41:57.974
Okay? I'm super tight with
the District Attorney.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.442
- That's not better.
- So...

42:00.645 --> 42:03.244
You know this rent that you're
gonna be paying...

42:03.489 --> 42:06.113
is it retroactive from
when you moved in?

42:06.474 --> 42:08.516
Um. Yes?

42:08.676 --> 42:10.794
That's great.
