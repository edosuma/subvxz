to the torso,

that smashed through

begs the question --

00:47.348 --> 00:49.314

a major crime?

00:49.316 --> 00:52.317
Two days ago, sir,

of his car and beat him up.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.736
Dr. morales: As Kendall
suggested, cause of death

03:57.738 --> 03:59.771
is blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.773

other injuries.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.185
This broken knee --
that had to hurt.

04:13.187 --> 04:16.221
Iron filings could be a crowbar
or a wrench.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.023
That'll do it.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.525

the victim was hit from behind,

04:35.042 --> 04:37.042
These older wounds
correspond with fists,

04:37.044 --> 04:39.578
which is consistent with
a face-to-face confrontation.

My professional opinion --

04:41.382 --> 04:43.615
beat up on Monday,
murdered on Wednesday.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.767
Uh, how do you describe
that medically?

20:36.769 --> 20:39.237
By saying, "oh, boy, do we need
to operate Mr. Flynn."

20:39.239 --> 20:41.539
Operate when?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.074
If we could,
I'd do it right now.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.875
I'm trying to counteract
the blood thinners,

20:44.877 --> 20:46.611
so I need to wait
for that to work a little

20:46.613 --> 20:48.346
before I can take your husband
to surgery.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.082

we're not --

I have his durable power
of attorney for health issues.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.855
How long
will he have to wait?

20:57.857 --> 21:00.258
Depends on how his blood work
comes back tonight.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.526
Well, at least
you're not dead, right?

21:02.528 --> 21:04.595
Listen, Mr. Flynn,
you feel funny again,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.397
this time, let someone know.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.898
Call the nurses, okay?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.433
Thank you.
Goodnight.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.537
Andy.

21:13.539 --> 21:17.208
All right, okay,
I-I get how serous this is,

21:17.210 --> 21:19.910
but there's not anything
anybody can do about it now.

21:19.912 --> 21:23.914
And you guys got a murder,
and why should everybody

21:23.916 --> 21:26.250
have a crummy Thanksgiving
because of me?

21:26.252 --> 21:28.653
I mean, I couldn't eat
any of the things

21:28.655 --> 21:31.289
we normally have anyway except,
I don't know,

21:31.291 --> 21:35.326
mashed potatoes
without the butter and Turkey.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.428
Oh, I could have
the Turkey.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.263
[ Cellphone ringing ]
And rolls,
and those little pickles.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.065
What are they called?
-Ye gods.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.301
While he's sitting here figuring
out his menu for tomorrow,

21:43.303 --> 21:45.903
tao's texted me a photo
of what

21:45.905 --> 21:49.006
Mrs. Palmer wrote
on her lineup form.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.175
Sharon:
She can't identify anybody.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.743
Or she won't.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.112
Sharon, if you go back,

21:55.114 --> 21:57.415
the case will probably end
a lot sooner.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.851
Hobbs: I understand
you had a detour

22:00.853 --> 22:03.821
in the possible road rage
killing.
More like a speed bump.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.525
I don't think Mrs. Palmer
was quite comfortable in
identifying the suspect.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.528
But no one can deny his prints
were on the victim's vehicle.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.630
But who can say
when they got there?

22:12.632 --> 22:15.499
And if this is
Jordan Garcia's fiancÃ©,

22:15.501 --> 22:18.636
this looks less like road rage
and more like a follow home.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.705
And it's possible that
the suspect wanted something

22:20.707 --> 22:23.274
out of the trunk and he didn't
get it on his first attempt.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.943
And if his knuckles were bloody
and his pickup was there...

22:25.945 --> 22:28.279
Look, Sam Curtis is good
for Monday's beating,

22:28.281 --> 22:30.214
but the murder, well,
for that,

22:30.216 --> 22:32.350
we have a woeful lack
of evidence.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.452
I don't mind arresting the guy
for aggravated assault

22:34.454 --> 22:35.986
and holding him
through the holiday.

22:35.988 --> 22:39.523
Ah, which brings me
to my next question.

22:39.525 --> 22:43.527
Aren't we close enough to leave
and come back Friday?

22:43.529 --> 22:46.197
If this runs past midnight,

22:46.199 --> 22:49.066
I'm at double time
for everyone here.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.203
No one wants us to be done
right now more than I do, chief,

22:52.205 --> 22:55.172
but if I'm gonna get ahead,
I need to back up

22:55.174 --> 22:58.309
to where I left off
and see where that gets us.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.313
Where she left off.

23:02.315 --> 23:03.881
Sanchez:
You lied to us, ma'am.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.384
You told us that you didn't have
a man in your life.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.386
I didn't lie to you, sir.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.689
You asked if I had a husband
or a boyfriend and I said no.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.157
Sam's my fiancÃ©.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.893
Since we're being
very specific with language,

23:15.895 --> 23:17.328
do you know the difference

23:17.330 --> 23:20.931
between murder
and accessory to murder?

23:20.933 --> 23:23.901
-Murder?
-Tom Palmer's dead, ma'am.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.037
What?
No, he isn't.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.106
I saw Tommy
at work yesterday.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.842
He has a black eye.
I have a picture of him.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.911
So do I.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.847
You sent your fiancÃ©
to beat tom Palmer up

Now we have her attention.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.118

<i>this morning to finish the job.</i>

23:41.120 --> 23:44.255
<i> No, no, I-I never told Sam</i>
<i> to beat Tommy up.</i>

23:44.257 --> 23:45.723
<i> He did that on his own.</i>

23:45.725 --> 23:47.691
That gives us
a Fuller picture.

23:47.693 --> 23:50.895
This only locks him in for
aggravated assault,
not the murder.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.797
<i> So, you had Sam follow</i>

23:52.799 --> 23:54.098

from work.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.766
No, it wasn't supposed
to be like that.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.437
Look, all I know is that Sam
punched Tommy a few times,

23:59.439 --> 24:02.239
Tommy fell down,
and Sam left him there.

24:02.241 --> 24:03.974
He called him an asshole
or something.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.276
Where was Sam
between the hours

24:05.278 --> 24:07.011
of 4:00 and 5:00 A.M.
this morning?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.981
I left for work
at 10 minutes after 4:00.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.384
Sam was home.
He was asleep.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.453
If you left him
around 4:00,

24:15.455 --> 24:18.689
how do you know
where he was at 4:30?

24:20.993 --> 24:25.095
Please, this is --
this is out of control.

24:25.097 --> 24:29.733
Sam and Tommy had a fist fight
on Monday and that's it.

24:29.735 --> 24:35.172
If this is murder, then I'm --
I'm invoking my rights.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.008
Talk to somebody else
for a while.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.153
Look, guys, if she
had identified my client,

he would've been booked
by now.

No, Mr. corbett, the witness
is your client's fiancÃ©.

to continue to cooperate,

Thomas Palmer to death.

let me grab that.
Okay.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.472
Starving anyway.

40:42.474 --> 40:45.241
Sharon.

40:45.243 --> 40:48.978
I spoke with lilly Palmer's
lawyer this morning,

40:48.980 --> 40:52.816
and he offered manslaughter,
but I can't take it.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.432
She had every opportunity
to say

41:09.434 --> 41:13.136
what she needed to say
and she didn't say it.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.506
We can only wonder why.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.441
Thank God,
so you understand.

41:18.443 --> 41:20.510
I do.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.348
I think I do.

41:25.350 --> 41:29.352
