00:24.360 --> 00:28.240
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

00:28.365 --> 00:32.036
six, five, four, three...

00:33.538 --> 00:35.102
One.

00:50.851 --> 00:54.147
I am truly sorry for what we've had to do.

00:55.273 --> 00:58.068
But we had no choice.

00:58.652 --> 01:03.408
When you get angry, Bruce,
when you're overcome by rage,

01:03.742 --> 01:06.496
you are a force of destruction.

01:13.129 --> 01:15.632
O most divine creator,

01:16.425 --> 01:18.135
I seek thy hand,

01:20.722 --> 01:26.938
and pray for the health of Sakaar,
for we are a divided and dying world.

01:28.648 --> 01:31.235
Through the ancient prophets,

01:31.318 --> 01:35.156
you have promised us a warrior saviour.

01:36.032 --> 01:37.785
You fear nothing

01:37.910 --> 01:42.123
and even the mightiest heroes of Earth
cannot deter you.

01:45.753 --> 01:51.969
A warrior who looks into the eyes of death
and stands his ground.

01:52.178 --> 01:56.808
The madder you get, the stronger you get,
and there is no limit to your rage.

01:56.808 --> 02:01.981
A warrior with boundless strength
whose power knows no end.

02:02.357 --> 02:05.058
We picked your destination carefully.

02:05.277 --> 02:10.449
A planet full of vegetation and game,
no intelligent life-forms.

02:15.039 --> 02:19.639
There will be no one there to hurt you
and no one you can hurt.

02:20.046 --> 02:24.593
Warning. Guidance system off-line.
Trajectory altered.

02:25.177 --> 02:31.018
I know you must hate us, Bruce, but you
always said you wanted to be left alone.

02:31.769 --> 02:34.147
May you finally find peace.

02:40.905 --> 02:45.244
And this warrior shall strike down all evil,

02:45.369 --> 02:47.121
unite all kingdoms,

02:47.663 --> 02:52.920
and through his blood shall restore life
to all of Sakaar.

02:54.505 --> 02:57.718
O most divine creator,

02:57.843 --> 03:00.972
deliver to us our saviour, the Sakaarson.

06:19.177 --> 06:21.806
By order of the Lord Emperor of Sakaar,

06:21.806 --> 06:26.916
all debris of value which exits
the Great Portal is Imperial property.

06:32.068 --> 06:33.633
Isn't right.

06:34.738 --> 06:39.745
First finders, that is the law.
He belongs to us!

06:40.245 --> 06:43.332
Enough. Now kneel.

06:54.513 --> 06:58.059
The talkbots have reached your brain
by now, beast,

06:58.059 --> 07:00.312
which means you understand me.

07:00.395 --> 07:02.898
So, on your knees.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.132
Kneel.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.325
Close enough.

07:34.772 --> 07:38.777
No, no. Miek no good. Miek dies easy.

07:39.110 --> 07:44.534
Somebody break the door. Let Miek out!
You, brick man, knock it open!

07:44.617 --> 07:46.453
Sit down.

07:46.870 --> 07:50.958
But Miek not a fighter. Miek a hider.

07:51.751 --> 07:54.922
Very thin-shelled and very...

07:55.047 --> 07:59.010
Hey, look. That one awake.

07:59.135 --> 08:03.224
You, snap your chains! Free us!

08:05.268 --> 08:06.978
That's enough, Miek.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.066
You won't regain your full strength
for a while,

08:10.066 --> 08:13.236
an unfortunate effect of passing
through the Portal.

08:13.236 --> 08:15.781
-I am Laven.
-Where am I?

08:15.864 --> 08:20.203
Inside an Imperial transport.
You've been sold as a slave.

08:20.328 --> 08:23.290
The Hulk is no one's slave!

08:26.086 --> 08:28.797
Easy. Hulk, is it?

08:29.173 --> 08:31.843
Those chains are Shadowforged.
They're unbreakable.

08:31.843 --> 08:34.388
You need to save your strength
for the games.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.889
Games?

08:35.889 --> 08:38.476
We are en route to the coliseum,

08:38.558 --> 08:42.731
where our deaths are scheduled
for today's entertainment.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.987
Miek a hider, not a fighter.

08:47.070 --> 08:49.865
Today, we are all fighters, Miek.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.536
And we must stand together
if we hope to survive this.

08:53.536 --> 08:56.540
-You have a plan?
-Yes, Korg, I do.

08:56.665 --> 08:59.127
We'll use your strength and endurance
to our advantage

08:59.127 --> 09:01.254
by having you hold the front line.

09:01.254 --> 09:03.674
You'll be tasked with weakening
our opponents.

09:03.674 --> 09:06.886
Hulk, we'll need you to fight alongside him.

09:08.639 --> 09:12.644
Hiroim, your battles during the Spike Wars
are legendary.

09:12.644 --> 09:15.939
You bring obvious skill
as well as speed and agility.

09:15.939 --> 09:18.985
I am proficient in hand-to-hand combat.

09:19.068 --> 09:21.488
I, too, should be on the front line.

09:21.488 --> 09:25.410
You’ll serve best in second position,
along with Hiroim and myself.

09:25.410 --> 09:29.415
Miek, you and the other natives
will join Elloe in the final position.

09:29.415 --> 09:33.127
No, no, no! We object!

09:33.253 --> 09:37.091
We are hived. He is outcast.

09:37.174 --> 09:41.722
Have you heard nothing I've said?
We fight as a team or we die.

09:41.722 --> 09:43.557
You demand too much.

09:43.641 --> 09:47.896
Especially for one who has served
the Red King.

09:47.979 --> 09:50.462
How dare you question his loyalty!

09:50.941 --> 09:52.777
Commander Laven is only a prisoner

09:52.777 --> 09:56.031
because he joined the resistance
to fight against that bloody tyrant.

09:56.031 --> 09:59.911
It's all right, Elloe.
The time for talking is over.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.435
We've arrived.

10:05.334 --> 10:09.423
Greetings, citizens and Oligarchs.

10:09.506 --> 10:12.927
Welcome to the Crown City Coliseum!

10:22.230 --> 10:26.027
Allow me to introduce today's contenders,

10:26.152 --> 10:28.947
the gladiators.

10:29.531 --> 10:32.670
Hoping they live longer than the last ones.

10:41.671 --> 10:45.760
And now, allow me to introduce
their opponents,

10:45.843 --> 10:48.805
red hot and ready to rumble,

10:48.889 --> 10:51.100
the Kronans!

10:55.856 --> 10:58.442
No. It can't be.

11:04.575 --> 11:06.139
Margus?

11:09.748 --> 11:12.668
Margus, I thought you were all dead.

11:13.127 --> 11:14.692
What...

11:23.765 --> 11:25.810
Hulk! Get back over here!

11:25.893 --> 11:29.314
Korg is down. Not so good.

11:31.650 --> 11:35.572
You got your wish, Android.
Now we're the front line.

11:35.697 --> 11:38.409
-Good.
-No, Android! Not yet!

12:27.971 --> 12:29.535
Move!

12:34.479 --> 12:36.043
Laven!

12:36.648 --> 12:38.275
We have to help him!

12:38.400 --> 12:44.116
-We do not take orders from Imperials.
-Let's get the one that's down.

12:44.199 --> 12:45.764
We can finish it!

12:57.007 --> 12:58.634
The natives are down.

12:59.844 --> 13:02.597
Very messy. Should have been hiders.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.089
Look out!

13:18.283 --> 13:19.848
Hiroim!

13:22.831 --> 13:26.377
Korg, we can't defeat them. Only you can.

13:26.502 --> 13:28.588
They are my brothers.

13:28.713 --> 13:32.635
They used to be. Their minds are gone.
Korg, please!

14:04.257 --> 14:05.822
No.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.980
Laven!

14:15.980 --> 14:20.778
-No. No.
-Margus, stop this.

14:21.070 --> 14:23.573
You have to listen to me. Please!

14:24.324 --> 14:25.888
Brother!

15:12.342 --> 15:15.680
Hurry! Faster! The Red King will see us!

15:16.306 --> 15:17.641
Red King?

15:17.641 --> 15:21.520
There. This is his planet.
We just living here.

15:21.896 --> 15:24.482
-Well, sire?
-Not bad.

15:24.858 --> 15:28.800
But what about the green one there?
Does he not fight?

15:29.197 --> 15:30.761
He'll fight.

15:31.491 --> 15:33.160
-Finally!
-What?

15:33.285 --> 15:35.746
Now I know who to smash!

15:35.872 --> 15:39.126
No, no! No, no, no! Wrong way.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.506
A stunning upset, yes.

15:44.007 --> 15:49.263
So, perhaps it's time
for a brief educational interlude.

15:50.139 --> 15:55.146
Let's explore the feeding habit
of our planet’s most ferocious predator,

15:55.146 --> 15:57.398
the Cavaranthus Mazorus,

15:57.524 --> 16:02.446
more commonly known
as the Great Devil Corker!

16:03.239 --> 16:04.804
Oh, fratz.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.084
Impressive display, monster.

17:19.166 --> 17:23.402
I'll have Primus throw an extra bone
in your cage tonight.

17:44.574 --> 17:46.535
Permission to execute him, my lord.

17:46.535 --> 17:50.832
No, wait. I'll take care of this one myself.

18:00.761 --> 18:03.013
The choice is yours, monster.

18:03.431 --> 18:06.893
Die on your feet or grovelling in the dirt.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.420
Dirt it is, then.

18:32.926 --> 18:34.490
Arm yourself!

18:35.763 --> 18:38.266
You don't learn, do you?

18:38.933 --> 18:41.979
Oh, I Learn.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.982
Now Hulk slash!

18:58.082 --> 19:01.660
You're strong, slave,
but you're no match for me.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.380
Is that so?

19:59.409 --> 20:01.161
Finish him, my Lord.

20:02.204 --> 20:06.000
No. No.
The people would think their king unfair.

20:08.044 --> 20:12.508
Behold!
Your emperor grants this gladiator his life

20:12.633 --> 20:16.722
so that he may continue fighting
for your entertainment.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.777
He bled you, sire, in front of the crowd.

20:27.902 --> 20:30.364
Is it wise to let him live?

20:30.447 --> 20:33.441
Who said anything about letting him live?

20:46.092 --> 20:49.721
We pass to next life one Laven Skee.

20:50.264 --> 20:55.353
Friend to some, enemy to others,
respected by all.

20:55.979 --> 20:58.232
He died trying to unite us.

20:59.275 --> 21:04.114
We must honour his death
by becoming Warbound.

21:04.698 --> 21:09.121
Warbound joins us, right? Like...
Like a hive?

21:09.204 --> 21:12.083
And Miek will belong?

21:12.166 --> 21:14.252
Yes, Miek. Now...

21:15.754 --> 21:17.589
You’ll have your turn.

21:18.174 --> 21:24.598
My name is Hiroim the Shamed
and you shall know the truth of who I am.

21:25.683 --> 21:29.896
Sacrilege! The divine creator
has answered our prayers

21:29.980 --> 21:32.650
by delivering to us the Sakaarson.

21:32.775 --> 21:36.947
Hiroim, it is written
that we shall know the saviour

21:37.072 --> 21:39.262
by his fulfilment of prophecy.

21:39.325 --> 21:40.785
You've seen for yourself.

21:40.785 --> 21:44.832
The Red King has struck down evil
by ending the Spike Wars.

21:44.832 --> 21:47.210
He is now uniting the kingdoms.

21:47.335 --> 21:50.839
It was his Death's Head guards
that ended the war,

21:50.839 --> 21:54.677
the same guards he uses
to oppress those very kingdoms.

21:54.677 --> 21:57.848
You forget, the prophecies speak
of the World Breaker

21:57.848 --> 21:59.517
as well as the Sakaarson.

21:59.517 --> 22:03.021
The Shadow priesthood
must stand as one, Hiroim.

22:03.230 --> 22:07.151
Will you not join us in shepherding in
this new era?

22:07.318 --> 22:11.615
When the real Sakaarson comes,
if one ever does,

22:12.867 --> 22:15.495
only then will I herald his arrival.

22:19.333 --> 22:22.765
May the divine creator have mercy
on your soul.

22:25.841 --> 22:30.222
They stripped me of my name,
banished me from the order

22:33.893 --> 22:36.187
and cast me into slavery.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.736
Have you heard the whispers
amongst the guards, Hiroim?

22:41.736 --> 22:46.283
Some dare say the Hulk might be
the true Sakaarson.

22:46.409 --> 22:50.247
-Then they do so out of desperation.
-How can you be so certain?

22:50.247 --> 22:54.836
Because Hulk is clearly not here
to save anyone but himself.

22:55.170 --> 22:56.880
Miek's turn to bind!

22:57.673 --> 23:02.387
Miek is Miek,
and it all begins in larva time when...

23:02.554 --> 23:04.118
Miek, not yet.

23:06.434 --> 23:09.187
My name is Korg of Krona,

23:09.270 --> 23:12.733
son of O-Korg and killer of my brothers.

23:14.068 --> 23:16.769
You shall know the truth of who I am.

23:20.618 --> 23:24.247
We Kronans are the plunderers of worlds.

23:24.331 --> 23:28.378
We take what we want.
Nothing has ever stood in our way,

23:28.378 --> 23:32.299
nothing until we found
a little speck of a planet

23:32.424 --> 23:35.553
green as the Hulk and third from its sun.

23:36.012 --> 23:37.848
We almost missed it.

23:38.390 --> 23:39.955
I wish we had.

23:40.309 --> 23:44.773
We saw our first native
and tried to capture it for study.

23:53.492 --> 23:55.902
But the creature had other ideas.

24:06.175 --> 24:09.606
He tore through the wall
of our strongest cage.

24:28.828 --> 24:32.082
And chipped the very stone
from our bodies.

24:56.029 --> 25:00.555
We were forced to use a weapon
that was built to fight armies.

25:39.374 --> 25:41.252
That's when we learned

25:43.546 --> 25:45.111
he wasn't alone.

26:00.776 --> 26:04.698
The two natives smashed our Warbot
like it was glass.

26:15.086 --> 26:17.463
Our only option was to flee.

26:18.506 --> 26:21.260
Unfortunately, one of them followed.

26:22.678 --> 26:25.056
We could not outrun the beast

26:25.181 --> 26:28.321
and only escaped by flying
into a wormhole.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.150
We crashed here on Sakaar.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.478
And that was the last time
I saw my brothers,

26:38.531 --> 26:40.096
until today.

26:40.659 --> 26:42.224
A question.

26:42.912 --> 26:45.373
-Miek's time?
-Almost.

26:45.457 --> 26:49.462
My name is Elloe,
daughter of ex-Governor Ronan Kaifi,

26:49.545 --> 26:51.548
founder of the resistance.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.833
You shall know the truth of who I am.

26:57.180 --> 27:01.602
-Sakaarson! Sakaarson! Sakaarson!
-Sakaarson! Sakaarson! Sakaarson!

27:01.602 --> 27:04.188
-Sakaarson! Sakaarson!
-Sakaarson! Sakaarson!

27:04.188 --> 27:08.715
-The crowd honours you, my Lord.
-They do not chant it for me.

27:10.905 --> 27:14.576
Hear that?
They think you're the saviour of this planet.

27:14.576 --> 27:16.141
They're wrong.

27:16.829 --> 27:18.415
Hulk, Listen to me.

27:18.540 --> 27:22.753
If we win the next two matches,
we’ll have earned our freedom.

27:22.753 --> 27:27.061
So, if you won't fight for us,
at least fight for yourself.

27:27.301 --> 27:29.220
And here they are,

27:29.971 --> 27:35.019
led by the fierce green gladiator
known as the Hulk!

27:35.644 --> 27:39.399
Though he defeated
the Great Devil Corker unscathed,

27:39.399 --> 27:42.695
he earned his first wound in the arena

27:42.778 --> 27:45.699
from the King himself!

27:46.533 --> 27:51.247
Now, let's see how he fares
against the most lethal marauders

27:51.331 --> 27:55.586
of the Chaleen Plains, the Wildebots!

28:12.482 --> 28:14.818
Circle! Shields up!

28:33.008 --> 28:34.572
Incredible.

28:39.391 --> 28:40.955
Blades out!

28:50.529 --> 28:52.094
Everybody move!

29:44.430 --> 29:45.994
Whoa!

29:51.105 --> 29:53.587
And don't be coming back for more.

30:00.575 --> 30:02.140
Send it in.

30:02.619 --> 30:05.122
It's not over yet, folks.

30:05.248 --> 30:08.585
I give you the king of the Wildebots,

30:08.669 --> 30:11.881
the Eggbreaker!

30:16.053 --> 30:18.389
Why is it called the Eggbreaker?

30:18.472 --> 30:23.583
So named for its habit of seeking out
and consuming native hatchlings.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.664
So much for their Sakaarson.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.944
State your business.

32:46.073 --> 32:48.868
Lieutenant! My apologies.

32:48.993 --> 32:50.558
Open the door.

32:50.621 --> 32:54.459
-But... But the Hulk! Perhaps we...
-Open it!

33:07.225 --> 33:09.269
-Come with me.
-No.

33:12.398 --> 33:13.962
Please.

33:19.865 --> 33:23.662
-What do you know of my king?
-He's a coward.

33:23.787 --> 33:25.351
He is no coward!

33:26.791 --> 33:31.588
-He's the saviour of our planet.
-That's not how I heard it.

33:35.718 --> 33:38.013
Then you have been misinformed

33:41.225 --> 33:42.936
because I was there.

33:49.319 --> 33:53.553
I was 13 years old
when the Spikes descended on our world.

34:15.226 --> 34:17.062
They spread quickly,

34:21.234 --> 34:24.518
infecting every Living creature they touched.

34:29.994 --> 34:32.987
Mine was the first village in their path.

34:33.206 --> 34:35.418
We were overrun within hours.

35:00.574 --> 35:05.612
I didn't understand it at first,
but I had the power of the Oldstrong

35:06.123 --> 35:08.678
and it protected me from infection.

35:11.713 --> 35:13.278
Mother?

35:18.180 --> 35:19.744
Caiera.

35:21.601 --> 35:23.165
Father?

35:34.784 --> 35:37.558
To survive their attacks, though, I...

35:41.333 --> 35:43.889
I was forced to cut down my friends

35:45.714 --> 35:47.278
and my family.

36:24.012 --> 36:28.225
And that's when the Red Prince arrived
with his Death's Head guards.

36:28.225 --> 36:31.000
He was Little more than a boy himself,

36:31.646 --> 36:33.211
but he saved me.

36:41.742 --> 36:45.413
Nice story. Why are you telling it to me?

36:46.665 --> 36:50.378
Because your actions in the arena
are turning the people away from their king,

36:50.378 --> 36:52.047
and I cannot allow that.

36:52.047 --> 36:53.799
So, what are you gonna do about it?

36:53.799 --> 36:58.346
I've Learned that the resistance will make
an attempt to break Elloe Kaifi out tonight.

36:58.346 --> 37:00.974
I can ensure they escape unharmed,

37:01.100 --> 37:03.186
as long as you go with them.

37:03.936 --> 37:05.063
And this thing?

37:05.063 --> 37:07.816
Go beyond the mountains,
and you'll be out of reach.

37:07.816 --> 37:10.486
It's desolate out there, but peaceful.

37:10.486 --> 37:12.896
You’ll never have to fight again.

37:13.740 --> 37:16.150
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

37:16.577 --> 37:19.039
Tell your king I'm not going anywhere.

37:19.039 --> 37:20.718
If he wants to kill me,

37:20.833 --> 37:24.775
he'll have to do it in the arena
in front of everyone.

37:47.282 --> 37:50.203
-Close it! Close it! Close it!
-Help me!

37:52.706 --> 37:54.875
Hulk, what did she want?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.627
It doesn't matter.

38:13.231 --> 38:14.796
Go away, Miek.

38:20.157 --> 38:23.077
What part of that didn't you understand?

38:23.536 --> 38:25.497
Miek giving this for you.

38:29.919 --> 38:33.465
-What is that?
-Eye of the Eggbreaker.

38:33.590 --> 38:38.805
Prophets say Sakaarson will look
into eyes of death and stand ground.

38:38.930 --> 38:42.351
To natives, Eggbreaker is death.

38:43.227 --> 38:45.605
Hulk is saviour.

39:00.582 --> 39:03.575
-What is this?
-It's our way out of here.

39:08.467 --> 39:10.177
It took you long enough.

39:10.177 --> 39:12.889
My apologies, Lady Elloe.

39:12.972 --> 39:15.017
Felan, it's you!

39:16.477 --> 39:18.646
Come on, everyone. We're leaving.

39:18.646 --> 39:22.109
Step outside, and you all die.

39:22.192 --> 39:24.570
No! Not if we leave now.

39:25.154 --> 39:28.659
-Hiroim?
-He spoke with the Shadow Guard, Elloe.

39:28.867 --> 39:33.748
-I think he knows something.
-He's a stupid brute! He knows nothing!

39:33.748 --> 39:35.959
This is our chance! Korg.

39:36.043 --> 39:40.006
If we win tomorrow, we're free anyway.

39:40.090 --> 39:43.010
-And if we don't?
-Hulk is new Sakaarson.

39:43.010 --> 39:44.574
He saviours us.

39:45.304 --> 39:47.495
Lady Elloe, we're out of time.

39:47.516 --> 39:49.706
We need to get you to An-Sara.

40:09.209 --> 40:10.774
Elloe!

40:24.562 --> 40:26.126
Divine creator,

40:27.023 --> 40:30.361
draw their souls gently into thy embrace.

40:47.090 --> 40:48.654
No, no.

40:51.804 --> 40:53.368
E.T.!

40:53.431 --> 40:55.434
We love you, Miek!

40:55.934 --> 40:57.728
You're the bug, Miek!

40:57.812 --> 40:59.397
Flex your thorax!

41:06.114 --> 41:11.151
This mob of misfits survived
their first two rounds against all odds.

41:12.705 --> 41:16.501
Will they earn their freedom
after today's match

41:16.627 --> 41:21.174
or be the latest victim
of the planet’s most notorious outlaw?

41:23.135 --> 41:27.056
The one-man army
that nearly toppled Crown City.

41:27.766 --> 41:30.352
Prepare yourselves for

41:32.647 --> 41:36.109
Battling' Beta Ray Bill!

41:37.528 --> 41:39.655
-It's him.
-Who?

41:39.781 --> 41:43.118
The alien who drove us off that planet.

41:43.327 --> 41:46.581
He must have followed my ship
through the Portal.

41:46.581 --> 41:48.917
Does he have any weaknesses?

41:49.334 --> 41:53.256
If he does,
we won't live long enough to find them.

41:53.339 --> 41:54.904
Forgive me.

42:34.724 --> 42:38.187
You, I hold no guilt about killing.

42:51.245 --> 42:53.706
Hulk, I know of you.

42:53.790 --> 42:57.753
The halls of Asgard echo
with tales of your rage.

42:57.878 --> 43:00.298
They ain't heard nothing yet.

43:19.238 --> 43:22.033
I act by the will of others, Hulk.

43:22.117 --> 43:27.456
The disk in my chest and in yours demand
that one of us must die.

43:27.832 --> 43:32.796
You have my sympathy
because it will not be me!

43:48.232 --> 43:49.943
This is impossible.

44:02.542 --> 44:04.461
By the prophets.

44:04.670 --> 44:09.488
''And through his blood,
he shall restore Life to all of Sakaar.''

44:44.511 --> 44:47.890
You broke the disk. I'm free.

45:10.085 --> 45:14.382
Hulk! You've won. It's over!
You don't need to kill him!

45:26.480 --> 45:29.609
The King has to Let us go now. We're free.

45:32.696 --> 45:34.323
Unbelievable!

45:35.074 --> 45:39.872
You saw it, folks,
the greatest upset in coliseum history!

45:40.331 --> 45:44.878
Despite three matches against Sakaar's
most indomitable opponents,

45:44.878 --> 45:47.506
the victory falls to the gladiators!

45:48.674 --> 45:52.262
And Look, the Red King is approaching,

45:52.387 --> 45:55.766
no doubt to congratulate our champions.

45:57.727 --> 46:00.522
Each of you, well done.

46:00.648 --> 46:02.650
Your emperor is very proud of...

46:02.650 --> 46:06.081
Save your breath
and give us what we've earned.

46:06.738 --> 46:08.303
Not just yet.

46:08.658 --> 46:15.082
As free citizens, you now have the privilege
of proving your loyalty to the empire.

46:22.049 --> 46:24.594
This is a traitor to your king.

46:27.431 --> 46:28.995
Elloe.

46:29.225 --> 46:30.789
I'm sorry.

46:31.227 --> 46:35.816
All you have to do is kill her,
and you can walk out of here.

46:41.282 --> 46:43.618
-No.
-Really?

46:43.701 --> 46:45.818
Does he speak for all of you?

46:45.829 --> 46:48.082
-He does.
-Yes.

46:48.207 --> 46:50.001
We are Warbounded.

46:53.589 --> 46:55.633
You all know the law.

46:55.925 --> 47:00.055
Sympathizing with rebels
is an offence against the crown

47:00.597 --> 47:02.391
punishable by death!

47:36.601 --> 47:39.896
No more slaves, just free people,

47:40.314 --> 47:43.234
tied only by the bonds they have chosen!

47:43.484 --> 47:46.029
Claim your freedom!

47:57.043 --> 48:01.548
Hulk! We are no longer anchored
to this world.

48:01.882 --> 48:03.509
I can take you home.

48:04.510 --> 48:06.721
Earth is no home of mine.

48:17.193 --> 48:18.757
Death's Head!

48:18.987 --> 48:21.615
Do not fight. Run!

48:30.501 --> 48:34.047
I'm gonna say this once. It's over.

48:34.172 --> 48:37.969
You come after me, and I'll crush you.
Got it?

48:56.659 --> 48:59.329
Well, wasn't that fun?

49:00.372 --> 49:01.748
Now what?

49:01.748 --> 49:04.544
We need to get out of here.
They'll be looking for us.

49:04.544 --> 49:08.131
We can follow these aqueducts
to the mountain reservoir at An-Sara.

49:08.131 --> 49:13.023
The Governor is a supporter
of the resistance. We'll be safe there.

49:15.891 --> 49:19.729
-Hulk, you're coming with us, aren't you?
-No.

49:20.230 --> 49:24.068
But you green saviour!
You need to protect our hive.

49:25.862 --> 49:27.614
This ain't my hive.

49:27.948 --> 49:34.080
But Miek knows having no hive is bad.
Alone is bad.

49:34.998 --> 49:36.750
Get out of my way, Miek.

49:36.750 --> 49:40.380
Please. Please! Miek is Hulk’s friend.

49:41.465 --> 49:43.384
I don't need any friends!

49:50.684 --> 49:52.896
Come on, Miek. We have to go.

50:11.294 --> 50:15.507
I want you to hunt down
and kill that monster!

50:15.841 --> 50:19.637
Sire, I should not Leave your side
at a time Like this.

50:19.637 --> 50:21.765
You do as you're told.

50:21.848 --> 50:24.560
Do you hear me? Now go!

50:40.956 --> 50:44.460
There have been so many attacks
on our safe houses and the underground,

50:44.460 --> 50:46.796
I was worried they'd gotten to you, too.

50:46.796 --> 50:52.053
Well, when you've been in the fight
this Long, you Learn how to survive.

50:58.978 --> 51:00.542
Come on, Miek.

51:05.152 --> 51:09.971
I wish it were more comfortable,
but at Least you’ll be safe here.

51:10.409 --> 51:14.581
Thank you.
I know you're risking a lot to do this.

51:14.706 --> 51:17.000
Not as much as you, Elloe.

51:17.084 --> 51:19.504
Your father would be very proud.

52:56.166 --> 52:59.628
You slaves, you were trilling for Miek?

53:00.296 --> 53:01.506
Yes.

53:01.506 --> 53:05.302
-You need saving?
-It is you who needs saving.

53:05.427 --> 53:06.992
From what?

53:13.187 --> 53:17.422
This is Governor Churik of An-Sara
with news for the King.

53:20.196 --> 53:21.906
I have the gladiators.

53:22.615 --> 53:26.662
-All of them?
-Yes, my Lord, all but the Hulk.

53:27.580 --> 53:30.281
They don't seem to know his location.

53:30.459 --> 53:33.525
No need to concern yourself with the Hulk.

53:33.546 --> 53:35.381
He will be dealt with.

53:36.049 --> 53:38.469
And your orders for the others?

53:38.552 --> 53:40.116
Kill them.

53:41.222 --> 53:43.996
You should not be hurting Miek's hive!

53:45.728 --> 53:47.355
Take care of this.

53:55.114 --> 53:57.159
Miek stopping you!

54:33.871 --> 54:36.291
If only you'd listened to me.

54:36.416 --> 54:38.877
Now my king demands your head.

54:39.002 --> 54:42.715
Funny, 'cause now I'm going after his.

54:42.799 --> 54:48.014
By the ancient laws of Sakaar,
I challenge you to fair and even combat.

54:48.806 --> 54:52.686
And since you hold no weapon,
neither will I.

55:38.118 --> 55:41.664
You're... You're healing.
You should be dead!

55:47.338 --> 55:52.010
No! No! He was... He was my father's friend.

55:52.135 --> 55:53.804
He was my friend!

55:54.221 --> 55:56.265
What if you were wrong, Miek?

55:56.265 --> 55:59.353
Elloe, he bears the wounds of an attack.

55:59.478 --> 56:01.063
We've been betrayed.

56:01.188 --> 56:06.737
And we should be thanking the divine
creator that Miek was able to stop him.

56:10.742 --> 56:14.163
And you killed him? All by yourself?

56:14.288 --> 56:16.374
Miek a fighter, not a hider.

56:16.499 --> 56:19.503
Now, you're sure the King saw you, Miek?

56:19.628 --> 56:22.673
Yes. Big eyes. Very surprised.

56:22.799 --> 56:25.552
Then he knows something's gone wrong
with his plan.

56:25.552 --> 56:27.388
We have to Leave, now.

56:51.459 --> 56:55.005
No. This can't be. Hulk!

57:50.533 --> 57:52.097
Spikes.

57:57.125 --> 58:01.463
Listen to me! Those are Spikes!
We have to stop them!

58:01.547 --> 58:04.133
That ain't my fight. This is!

58:10.767 --> 58:14.187
What about your friends?
They're in that village, too!

58:14.187 --> 58:16.357
I don't have any friends!

58:36.507 --> 58:39.865
I once thought
you were a man of honour, Hulk.

58:39.928 --> 58:42.097
Now I see my king was right.

58:42.765 --> 58:44.934
You're nothing but a monster.

59:02.706 --> 59:06.086
This way! This way! Get behind us!

59:23.148 --> 59:25.777
This way! Move!

59:36.123 --> 59:37.792
Mommy, please stop!

01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:36.532
We win this.

01:00:36.991 --> 01:00:39.744
Whatever you say, bug. I'm with you.

01:00:53.011 --> 01:00:54.575
Hulk!

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.744
Hulk, over here!

01:00:57.516 --> 01:00:59.081
Miek, get back!

01:01:15.831 --> 01:01:17.395
Not you!

01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:39.902
Caiera, well done. You lured the Hulk there.

01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:43.949
Sire, we need help!
The Spikes have returned!

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:45.952
I know. I sent them.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.582
-You what?
-Don't be so surprised.

01:01:50.666 --> 01:01:53.628
The Spikes have always been
my greatest weapon.

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:55.338
They helped me find you.

01:01:55.338 --> 01:01:59.969
And now they'll rid this world
of that green monster and his friends.

01:01:59.969 --> 01:02:02.524
You unleashed them onto my village?

01:02:02.639 --> 01:02:07.353
I needed an Oldstrong as my shadow,
and that was the only way to find one.

01:02:07.353 --> 01:02:12.443
But... But my people, my parents!
You killed them!

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:16.844
Unless you want to join them, Caiera,
I suggest you Leave.

01:02:17.992 --> 01:02:19.556
Now.

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:30.215
-Hulk needs us!
-We can't help him now.

01:02:32.218 --> 01:02:34.043
We've got other problems.

01:02:44.525 --> 01:02:46.485
Get in the cave!

01:02:48.863 --> 01:02:50.428
To the back! Quickly!

01:02:50.449 --> 01:02:52.013
Go! Go now!

01:03:08.763 --> 01:03:11.642
-I'm scared.
-It's all right.

01:03:12.393 --> 01:03:14.437
Just close your eyes.

01:03:35.755 --> 01:03:37.320
Hulk?

01:04:18.725 --> 01:04:20.290
Is he dead?

01:04:20.853 --> 01:04:22.272
Yes.

01:04:22.272 --> 01:04:26.652
Excellent. Then I want his body brought
back here and paraded through the streets.

01:04:26.652 --> 01:04:28.216
Understood?

01:04:28.571 --> 01:04:30.991
Yes, sire.

01:04:31.491 --> 01:04:32.868
What about the others?

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:35.663
They're alive. Hulk saved them.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:41.963
That's fine. Bring them back as well.
I'll handle their executions personally.

01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:33.381
Don't Look so glum, Lieutenant.
This is a great day for all of Sakaar.

01:05:36.656 --> 01:05:38.492
My loyal citizens,

01:05:38.992 --> 01:05:42.246
you’ll be relieved to know
that the violent prisoners

01:05:42.246 --> 01:05:46.627
responsible for that destructive riot
have been apprehended.

01:05:46.919 --> 01:05:51.091
Unfortunately, the most savage of them all

01:05:51.216 --> 01:05:54.094
will not be feeling the executioner's blade,

01:05:54.094 --> 01:05:57.933
for you cannot kill what is already dead.

01:06:04.774 --> 01:06:08.696
I'm not dead. I'm just mad.

01:06:12.576 --> 01:06:14.140
He's loose!

01:06:14.286 --> 01:06:16.414
Stop him! Look out!

01:06:32.267 --> 01:06:33.352
Get him!

01:06:33.352 --> 01:06:35.020
Move! Move!

01:08:24.991 --> 01:08:28.203
All Death's Head guards to my position!
Now!

01:09:48.053 --> 01:09:51.974
Wait! Stop! Stop! Don't kill me! Please!

01:09:55.062 --> 01:09:58.608
That pleasure belongs to someone else.

01:10:06.534 --> 01:10:10.247
Caiera, you're my shadow. You can't!

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.087
It's not me you have to fear.

01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:23.326
It's your legacy.

01:10:32.608 --> 01:10:34.173
No!

01:10:44.206 --> 01:10:46.960
Kill them! Kill them all!

01:10:47.919 --> 01:10:50.130
Spike infestation detected.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.668
I knew you'd come.

01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:24.465
Almost didn't.

01:11:24.465 --> 01:11:26.759
All of Sakaar now looks to you.

01:11:27.302 --> 01:11:30.733
What if they're looking
in the wrong direction?

01:11:31.557 --> 01:11:33.267
You are their saviour.

01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:38.253
I've never been called anything
but a monster.

01:11:39.192 --> 01:11:44.886
Hulk, those from your old world did not
understand you. They did not know you.

01:11:48.286 --> 01:11:49.851
Not Like we do.

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:53.261
We've witnessed your true strength.

01:11:54.836 --> 01:11:58.559
All my Life, I've moved
from one fight to the next.

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:01.094
Now I don't know what to do.

01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:04.974
Then allow me to take that journey
with you.

01:12:10.731 --> 01:12:12.295
They're ready for us.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:03.839
He came from a place called Earth,
exiled by the creatures who Live there.

01:13:04.757 --> 01:13:06.676
They feared his power.

01:13:07.176 --> 01:13:11.974
But here, that power was used
to strike down evil,

01:13:12.391 --> 01:13:17.606
to unite the kingdoms,
to restore Life to all of Sakaar.

01:13:18.148 --> 01:13:22.946
And through him, may we finally find peace.
