00:01.502 --> 00:04.671
[Singing] It seems today that all you see

00:04.838 --> 00:08.050
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.133 --> 00:11.595
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.678 --> 00:14.723
On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:17.976
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.060 --> 00:21.438
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.522 --> 00:22.981
All the things that make us

00:23.065 --> 00:24.608
Laugh and cry

00:24.691 --> 00:29.655
He's a family guy

00:32.741 --> 00:34.493
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.161
Oh, this is so exciting.

00:36.245 --> 00:39.748
This is the tenth year my father's
raced his yacht in the Newport Regatta.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.125
Man, I hope he lets me
on his team this year.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.837
I haven't been part of a team
since I was with the Four Peters.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.591
[Humming in harmony]

01:16.451 --> 01:19.204
-Come on, Stewie. Let's go.
-Yes, yes. I'm just checking the mail.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.415
-I say, here's one from the vet.
-Give me that.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.918
Good lord, worms? You have worms?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.963
I don't have worms, all right?
I just got checked for worms.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.715
Oh, wait. No, I do have worms.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.177
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?
I can't afford the medication for this.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.888
-Well, you could ask Lois and the fat one.
-No. No. No.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.848
You cannot tell them about this, please.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.100
Peter is not very discreet
with private matters.

01:40.392 --> 01:43.729

Meg just had her first period!

01:43.812 --> 01:46.523

trying to sleep.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.572
PETER: I'm just saying, I'm proud of her.
She's a woman.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.658
GLENN: Yes, that's very hot,
and I'll deal with it in the morning...

01:56.742 --> 01:58.243
but right now, I am exhausted.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.661
Just please don't tell them.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.664
Perhaps you should worry
a little less about your pride...

02:02.748 --> 02:04.374
and a little more about
the creepy-crawlies...

02:06.752 --> 02:09.796

02:50.671 --> 02:51.880
Hiya, Mr. Pewterschmidt.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.383
Peter, I see
you're still fatter than holy hell.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.343
You can read me like a book.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.930
So, which of the Latin countries
are you from?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.266
The one with the civil war,
the one with the cocaine...

03:02.349 --> 03:03.809
or the one with the fancy hats?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.603
Isn't this fun, Peter?

03:06.687 --> 03:09.022
You and I get to stay
in my old high-school room.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.441
Wow. This looks
just like my room at home.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.862
Yeah, except for all the trophies
and pictures of friends.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.781
That's the second most impressive trophy
I've ever seen.

Nelly.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.254
Wow, Mom.
Were you a Miss Teen Rhode Island?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.882
I sure was, Meg, when I was 16 years old.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.718
In fact, your mom
was offered a modeling contract.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.803
Really? Why didn't you take it?

03:40.679 --> 03:43.515
Well, I wanted to,
but your grandfather wouldn't let me.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.726
But, Daddy, they offered me a contract.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.353
My girl is not lowering herself
to modeling.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.148

is below this family.

No. No, I just thought you might want
some extra seamen...

Oh, yes, the new fellow. Come on in.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.730
What exactly am I supposed to do?

10:04.813 --> 10:07.774
You'll pick up the phone
and you'll sell, sell, sell.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.194
But before you go thinking
it's all seriousness...

10:10.277 --> 10:13.363
the first Friday of every month
is Wacky-Tacky-Tie Day...

10:13.697 --> 10:18.702
so, you know, start thinking up
some fun tacky ties to wear.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.164
Oh, we're done.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.168
Here you go, guys.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.713
Lois, could I be a son of a bitch
and impose on you...

10:29.796 --> 10:31.715
to sign one of your flyers for me.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.675
Of course, Cleveland.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.220
Oh, man.
I can't believe I'm sleeping with a model.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.138
I'm luckier than
the State of Rhode Island.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.641
Well, I can't decide
what to call this place.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.808
We'll flip a coin.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.646

Yes, I suppose I am.

Listen, sugar, I've seen your stuff.
You're a breath of fresh air in my stoma.

10:59.618 --> 11:02.996
I could get you a lot more work
if you sign with my agency.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.667
Really? Oh, my God! How exciting.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.836
Well, here's my card. Give me a call.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.839
Now, perhaps some young gentleman
would like to light me up.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.090
Allow me.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.593
So, what's going on?

11:16.677 --> 11:18.595
You ever get freaky
with that thing or what?

11:19.513 --> 11:22.641

come in here for one second?
