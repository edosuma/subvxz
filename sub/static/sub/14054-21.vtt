<i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:05.233
- Hi, Theresa.
- Hi, Marissa.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.992
- Eddie.
- I'm looking for Theresa. 

00:07.160 --> 00:08.798
- We're engaged.
- Engaged?

00:08.960 --> 00:11.838
- You look good.
- I'm Marissa's mother. You're a student.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.036
- You mean it's over?
- No, I'll see you tonight.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.758
A friend's in trouble.
I want you to help him.

00:15.920 --> 00:16.989
Uncle Shaun.
In that room...

00:17.160 --> 00:19.515
...you accidentally stumbled
into were documents...

00:19.680 --> 00:21.750
...containing information
valuable to Caleb.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.150
- Construction's a dirty business.
- My answer's no.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.958
And Kirsten? She's complicit in this.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.553
- Do you love her?
- I don't know.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.835
Be ready to fight for her.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.678
- I don't want you to go.
- Why don't I want to go?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.836
- But what kind of kiss was it?
- I don't know.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.877
A kiss. My lips, Theresa's lips. A kiss.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.429
Lips. Now, that's interesting.
Was there tongue?

00:39.600 --> 00:41.352
- I'm not answering that.
- Why?

00:41.520 --> 00:43.431
- You really want to know?
- No.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.194
But just tell me this:
What level of kiss are we talking?

00:46.400 --> 00:48.391
Was it like a Christina-Madonna peck?

00:48.560 --> 00:50.596
Or was it a Britney-Madonna
sort of smooch?

00:50.760 --> 00:54.150
Or was it like a full-on
Al and Tipper Gore lip-Iock?

00:54.320 --> 00:56.709
- It was just a kiss.
- Okay. So you guys a couple now?

00:56.880 --> 01:00.475
Is she staying here? If so, where's she
gonna live? How? What's her credit like?

01:00.640 --> 01:04.315
What sort of lease is she looking to sign?
Are we talking a year or month-to-month?

01:04.480 --> 01:06.710
- Or is she looking to buy?
- There's no lease, okay?

01:06.880 --> 01:08.791
So then what? She goes back?
What do you do?

01:08.960 --> 01:10.518
Commute back and forth from Chino?

01:10.680 --> 01:12.716
If you're commuting,
whose car you gonna take?

01:12.880 --> 01:15.917
How you gonna pay for gas?
What freeway is your freeway of choice?

01:16.080 --> 01:19.914
You gonna take the 55 to the 5?
Or the 91 to the 71? If you take the 71...

01:20.200 --> 01:22.031
- Just, whoa.
- Okay. I'll just whoa.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.636
You guys kissed, and I think you should
have a plan, because it's a big deal.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.552
- You're making it a big deal.
- Really?

01:27.720 --> 01:29.199
I don't even know when
I'd see her again.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.430
- Hi.
- Theresa. Hey.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.511
Hey. We were just
discussing your plan.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.318
- What plan?
- Yeah, exactly.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.948
I had the morning off,
thought you'd need a ride to school.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.314
- Oh, yeah. Great.
- Yeah.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.948
- I hope it's okay, me stopping by.
- It's fine. Come on.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.509
- Yeah. Sure. Why wouldn't it be?
- Okay.

01:44.960 --> 01:47.713
- Marissa. Hello.
- Hey.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.759
- Theresa. Hi. I didn't think you'd be...
- Staying? Yeah, well...

01:54.080 --> 01:56.435
- What's up?
- I thought maybe you'd need a ride...

01:56.600 --> 01:57.874
...to school.
- Oh. Thanks.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.719
Cool.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.594
Well, I can go with Marissa,
and Ryan and Theresa can go together.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.673
- No. No, Seth, really. It's okay.
- It makes more sense if you take them.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.276
Why? Because we go to the same school?
Because I live here?

02:17.600 --> 02:20.717
I'll go with Marissa,
and Ryan and Theresa can go...

02:20.880 --> 02:22.757
Yeah. Sorry. You know what?

02:22.920 --> 02:25.309
- I should have called first.
- I should've called too.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.790
- I'll just see you guys at school.
- I shouldn't just stop by. I'm gonna go.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.428
- No, wait, wait. It's...
- Call me later.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.629
We're hitchhiking.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.509
- Morning, beautiful.
- Good morning.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.994
Marissa.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.629
Kirsten. Sandy.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.752
Well, you're not gonna believe who is
<i>Riviera Magazine</i>'s Man of the Year.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.434
- Theresa.
- Mrs. Cohen. Mr. Cohen.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.869
Well, that's nice. I mean, she really
deserves the award. Good kid.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.792
It's my dad.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.995
My vote stays with Theresa.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.518
- Hi.
- Hey. Is it a good morning?

03:39.680 --> 03:42.478
So, Ryan, a couple of your friends
stopped by briefly.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.029
- Yeah, we know. It was awkward.
- Is Theresa staying?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.668
- Yeah. Looks that way.
- I thought she was going home.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.398
No. Change of plans.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.471
It's amazing. His lips don't even move.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.229
- Well, how long is she staying?
- Well...

03:54.800 --> 03:56.313
You tell them.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.872
- We're figuring it all out.
- Is she gonna, what, rent a place?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.474
What kind of lease? Month-to-month?
Year? Can she buy?

04:03.680 --> 04:05.796
- What you gonna do?
- I'm this way for a reason.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.236
- She's catering a tennis tournament.
- Is she gonna get a job after that?

04:09.400 --> 04:12.631
- What about the guy she's engaged to?
- Is she going back to school?

04:13.440 --> 04:16.113
- School. Bye.
- Now you know why I do the talking.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.793
We're gonna need a ride,
by the way. Thanks.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.995
I'll take them.
It's on my way to the office.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.436
- So is my dad gonna be in a good mood?
- Well, he should be.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.353
- He's Man of the Year.
- I meant the case.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.193
- Are you gonna take it?
- I'm thinking about it.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.874
We're gonna host the reception here
for my dad's award.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.793
And it would be nice if Uncle Shaun
could be here.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.269
Not if we have to pay for the bar tab.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.910
I'm thinking about it.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.392
Hey.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.039
Hey.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.356
Can I ask you something?

05:07.520 --> 05:09.112
Yeah. Sure.

05:10.680 --> 05:15.310
When you and I broke up,
and I started dating Ryan...

05:16.080 --> 05:19.356
...was it hard for you to see us together?
- Yeah.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.637
But, hey, we wouldn't
have broken up if I hadn't...

05:24.680 --> 05:26.636
...deserved it.
- I guess now I know...

05:26.800 --> 05:28.438
...what it feels like, huh?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.716
To deserve it.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.398
The sooner you realize that it's never
gonna go back to the way it was...

05:45.120 --> 05:47.680
...the sooner you can move on.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.716
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.668
- Hey, Ryan. I'm sorry about this morning.
- No, no. That's okay.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.470
- I didn't realize she was gonna be there.
- Yeah. There was a change of plans.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.039
How long is she staying for?

06:04.200 --> 06:07.078
No, she's gotta find a job, a place to live.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.879
- Minor details, huh?
- Yeah.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.509
Well, if you need any help...

06:13.720 --> 06:15.392
Thanks.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.714
- Check out Gramps. He looks angry.
- That's because he is.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.393
Why? He's on a magazine cover.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.869
Hard to believe that doesn't
leave him fulfilled.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.032
Totally. I know. I love the society page.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.919
It's like, suddenly, all of the people
we know are famous.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.833
- Diana Kahn totally got a chin implant.
- They have chin implants?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.389
My dad does them.
He says chins are the new nose.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.315
- So did Picasso.
- Really? What hospital does he work for?

06:42.240 --> 06:44.196
Kidding. I'm not that dumb. Just shallow.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.757
Is all this talk of Newport and
plastic surgery boring you, Anna?

06:47.920 --> 06:50.115
No. Actually, I'm savoring it.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.750
I won't be hearing it much longer.
I'm leaving.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.435
- You getting dessert?
- No. I'm going back to Pittsburgh.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.828
- What?
- I'm gonna go live...

06:59.000 --> 07:02.356
...with my aunt and uncle.
I've just kind of had enough of Newport...

07:02.520 --> 07:04.476
...so I'm leaving.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.355
Park-ranger cadet?
Full-time position available.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.551
I wouldn't look good in the hat.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.154
You'd get to put out forest fires.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.675
Moving on.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.475
Classifieds are...

07:23.640 --> 07:25.710
Depressing?

07:26.800 --> 07:30.156
- We'll find something. We'll figure it out.
- I know.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.754
I'm glad you called me to come meet you.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.199
Who knew being unemployed
could be so much fun?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.316
I gotta get to class.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.679
- It will be okay.
- Okay.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.953
Kaitlin. Hi.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.156
Hi, Luke. What's going on?

08:19.320 --> 08:23.154
Well, I just finished school for the day,
you know, which is always a good thing.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.959
I so know what you mean.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.397
- Luke. What are you doing here?
- We're talking, Mom.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.514
Go get ready.
Daddy's coming to take you to dinner.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.234
So I'll see you soon?

08:41.159 --> 08:42.957
Luke, you know not to
come to the house.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.236
- We meet at the motel.
- I just thought...

08:45.400 --> 08:47.356
...that you needed help
with your DSL.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.478
Luke, as much as I want
high-speed Internet access...

08:50.640 --> 08:53.712
...it's not worth Kaitlin
becoming suspicious.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.909
Hey, Jules. Luke.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.833
Luke just came by
to defrag my hard drive.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.399
Okay.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.755
Hurry along, Luke. Make it quick.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.715
I'll make sure Kaitlin's ready.

09:18.280 --> 09:22.592
Hey, should I put another piece of
swordfish on for Theresa? Or Marissa?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.950
Or any other ladies you plan
on having over?

09:25.120 --> 09:29.352
- I was gonna go pick up Theresa, so...
- Done and done.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.080
So how's that going with you guys?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.916
Good. Just trying to figure it out.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.117
- "It" being?
- Pretty much everything.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.272
- You want to know what I think?
- You're gonna tell me either way.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.796
Like my own son.
You're in high school, she should be...

09:44.960 --> 09:48.669
...you're both in way over your heads.
She's got no real job, no place to live.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.910
- Don't ask if she can stay here.
- I wouldn't.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.436
Good. You have no idea what Kirsten did
the last time I floated such a concept.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.239
Theresa's got family in Chino.
She's got a life in Chino.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.914
Running away is not the answer.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.508
I know.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.319
- It's kind of crazy.
- No. It's sweet.

10:04.480 --> 10:08.678
It's totally misguided,
but it's kind of charming.

10:08.840 --> 10:14.358
You gotta tell her. It's time she faced
the music. Or at least the fianc Á.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.195
And you're gonna do that thing with
the white lights in your back yard, right?

10:18.360 --> 10:22.273
- Of course, Dad.
- Good. I love the white lights.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.671
- And no cilantro. I hate cilantro.
- You're Man of the Year.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.354
I think they can make some food
without cilantro.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.118
I'll have to make a toast.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.510
You've got that '73 Dom
in your wine cellar, yes?

10:32.680 --> 10:34.830
I think you went through that
on your birthday.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.398
- Kirsten. Mr. Nichol.
- Why don't you call him Caleb.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.797
- Congrats on your award.
- Means nothing.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.349
They're lucky I agreed to pose
for their front cover.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.398
Use that in your speech.
Want me to set a place for Theresa?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.791
- I'll get back to you on that one.
- I'm gonna go check on the Dom.

10:53.960 --> 10:58.158
- I was thinking chardonnay for dinner.
- No, get the pinot.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.639
Do what you like. It's your house.
I'm just making a salad.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.598
Man of the Year and still so modest.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.718
I'm so glad to see it
hasn't gone to your head, Cal.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.269
The case. Have you made your decision?

11:10.440 --> 11:15.275
I've decided what it'll take to make me
decide. You tell Kirsten everything.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.917
- She's better off not knowing.
- She's not. You are.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.040
She is already implicated,
without her knowledge.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.872
Then why worry her?

11:24.040 --> 11:26.918
- This may all go away, you know.
- It may not.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.911
I won't spend the next year
lying to her.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.753
So if you want my help,
you tell her everything.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.712
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.348
- We should talk.
- I have news.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.313
You go first.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.312
I just got off the phone with Eddie.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.036
And I told him I'm not coming home
anytime soon.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.869
- You did?
- He didn't take it well.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.679
But now that I did it,
which I can't believe I did...

11:58.840 --> 12:02.799
...I feel so much more free or something.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.829
What did you want to talk about?

12:08.280 --> 12:10.350
How do you feel about swordfish?

12:19.120 --> 12:22.237
- So she's leaving.
- No, she's staying.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.753
What? When did you
talk to Anna?

12:23.920 --> 12:25.831
She told me she's going
back to Pittsburgh.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.471
- Anna's going back to Pittsburgh?
- Not anymore, according to you.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.037
- I'm totally confused.
- She, Anna, is leaving.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.191
She, Theresa, is staying.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.112
Right. Got it.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.909
- So she really is leaving.
- That sucks.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.193
Do you think it's because of me?

12:47.840 --> 12:50.195
I can't believe I caused a girl
to leave the state.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.557
- The county, maybe. Sure. Fine.
- You really think it's because of you?

12:53.920 --> 12:57.390
Well, I mean, we broke up, she went
back East, she had a great time...

12:57.560 --> 12:59.312
...she comes back, only to see me...

12:59.480 --> 13:02.119
...standing on a coffee cart
declaring my love for Summer.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.675
Maybe she just doesn't feel
that comfortable here.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.355
I know. I get that. But if it is because
of me, maybe I can talk her out of it.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.476
Except I can't ask her
if it's because of me...

13:10.640 --> 13:12.437
...without sounding totally
self-absorbed.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.398
And I'm not self-absorbed, right, Ryan?
Me. Me.

13:15.560 --> 13:19.439
- Me.
- Sorry. Just thinking about Theresa.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.076
- She's staying. What am I gonna do?
- She's leaving. What am I gonna do?

13:30.920 --> 13:33.309
Kiki, thanks for meeting me.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.517
- Is everything okay?
- Why don't you have a seat.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.715
Is it Uncle Shaun?

13:46.440 --> 13:51.036
The hotel room that he accidentally
stumbled into the other day...

13:51.200 --> 13:53.953
- Joel McKuin was staying there.
- That's quite a coincidence.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.396
Joel McKuin is the leading lumber
supplier on the West Coast.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.274
Not such a coincidence.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.309
It's not the first time that he's
accidentally stumbled into a hotel room.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.391
It's just the first time he's got caught.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.471
I knew Uncle Shaun
was a tough negotiator.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.916
And, yeah, he sent extra-nice
Christmas presents to certain Teamsters.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.390
Breaking and entering? Theft? What else?

14:15.560 --> 14:18.597
Blackmail? Racketeering?

14:20.880 --> 14:23.075
- Is he going to jail?
- Not if Sandy can help it.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.630
Well, if he can't,
are they gonna go after you?

14:27.640 --> 14:30.108
I'm afraid it's not just me.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.913
Hey.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.437
- Catching up on Western civ?
- Yeah, Spanish Inquisition. Lot of fun.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.717
Tell me about it.
Could they give us any more reading?

14:47.920 --> 14:49.717
- Get up.
- Eddie. Eddie, what's going on?

14:49.880 --> 14:52.348
You know exactly what's going on.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.230
- You sleep with her?
- No. No.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.868
No? Then why'd she call me
and say she's not coming back?

14:58.040 --> 15:00.349
- Why would she stay here?
- This isn't the right time.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.988
No, don't touch me.
After all I did for you growing up.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.639
The least you can do is
be honest with me.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.756
Now, you be a man, and you tell me.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.672
- Are you sleeping with her?
- No.

15:08.840 --> 15:13.277
Excuse me. This lounge is
for faculty and students only.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.950
I'm not letting her go.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.918
Anna. Hey.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.877
- Hi.
- This is nice weather we're having.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.156
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, did you hear? The Lakers won.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.436
- Oh, did they?
- Yeah. Yeah, they did.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.637
There's something else I wanted
to talk to you about. What was it?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.791
That's it. You're leaving.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.758
- Why the hell are you leaving?
- You know, I'm late for class.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.434
- You got at least three minutes.
- It's too complicated.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.160
Why don't you start with one reason.
There's gotta be...

15:56.320 --> 15:59.471
...one main, overriding reason.
- Fine. Look, I miss the seasons.

15:59.640 --> 16:03.633
I miss fall foliage. I miss the snow.
I miss the first signs of spring.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.394
- You miss the seasons?
- Yeah, and...

16:07.160 --> 16:08.513
And?

16:08.680 --> 16:11.513
And my little dog, Swifty.
We left him with my aunt and uncle.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.639
And the Jimmy Stewart Museum.
And Peanut Butter Cup Pie at Dingbats.

16:15.800 --> 16:21.591
The vinyl selection at Record Village.
And Sundays, the SuperFlea Fleamarket.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.428
I guess I did get it
into three minutes, huh?

16:24.600 --> 16:28.673
So that's it? There's not, like,
one other reason?

16:28.840 --> 16:31.718
- Did I say Peanut Butter Cup Pies?
- Yeah.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.952
- Then, no.
- Good. Excellent.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.155
Tomorrow, we're having this thing
for my grandpa...

16:39.320 --> 16:41.356
- I leave tomorrow.
- Not without saying goodbye.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.112
- I'll come say goodbye.
- Okay.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.158
Is there anything I can do to help?

16:54.320 --> 16:55.594
- You, Theresa...?
- Yeah, sure.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.228
She needs a job and a place to live,
if you got anything.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.789
Does she need a friend?
I could help out there.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.394
Invite her to Caleb's party.
We'll all hang out.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.393
Why the hell would you want that?

17:08.680 --> 17:11.240
Look, I'm used to getting what I want.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.073
Which I know is not
the most attractive quality.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.310
But I also know I can't compete
with a girl...

17:16.480 --> 17:18.516
...you've known your whole life.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.832
Not after everything that's
just come between us.

17:25.319 --> 17:29.916
I don't think she has clothes,
a dress, for it.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.870
But thanks.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.519
Hey.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.831
- How was the rest of your day?
- I wanted to see how you were doing.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.952
After the Heights,
I knew that my dad wasn't aboveboard.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.590
But this is beyond anything
that I could have imagined.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.079
We're gonna figure this out.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.635
You better believe I'll do
all I can to protect you.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.315
No. I don't want you to.
I'm going to get outside counsel.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.074
I do not want you involved.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.594
When I asked for your help,
I had no idea what I was asking you for.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.718
- I know that.
- But this is my mistake, not yours.

18:19.880 --> 18:25.000
And I will not let you compromise
yourself, not even for me.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.957
I'm gonna call the caterers.

18:27.120 --> 18:31.033
Make sure that there's no cilantro
for the Man of the Year.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.836
She's lying. I know it.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.709
- What? Who?
- Anna.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.668
- You're thinking about Anna right now?
- I just...

18:52.840 --> 18:56.071
I just wish I could convince her
not to leave because of me.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.198
You think she's leaving
just because of you?

18:59.360 --> 19:01.157
It makes sense, doesn't it?

19:01.320 --> 19:03.595
Yeah. But even if I thought it,
I wouldn't say it.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.390
I mean, it's a little self-absorbed, Cohen.

19:09.160 --> 19:12.835
- I just never wanted to hurt her feelings.
- Maybe she just doesn't like it here.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.389
I hear there are a few people who don't.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.836
It does rain sometimes in January.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.671
I'm kind of...

19:28.360 --> 19:30.828
I'm kind of hungry. You want to eat?

19:31.440 --> 19:32.953
Thanks.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.472
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.359
Are you still good at foot massages?
I've been on my feet...

19:45.520 --> 19:48.671
- We gotta talk.
- So no foot massage?

19:48.840 --> 19:52.150
Listen. Listen, I don't know
what to do about us.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.596
I can't get you a job, a place to live.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.318
- I live in a pool house.
- Shut up.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.790
Shut the hell up.
I don't need you to take care of me.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.951
- I can take care of myself.
- I know, I know.

20:03.120 --> 20:07.591
I am not one of these Newport chicks
that needs a trust fund to survive.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.550
But the fact that you thought
I needed you is really great.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.677
Sweet.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.112
Sexy.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.430
What about Eddie?

20:24.200 --> 20:27.397
I told Eddie that I can't
marry him right now.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.471
Just because you're okay with it
doesn't mean he is.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.712
I'm not okay with it,
I just know it's for the best.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.515
I'm here to be with you.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.439
Are we doing this?

20:44.640 --> 20:47.757
It's not like we haven't before.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.309
- What's the matter?
- It's not like home.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.153
I got people that notice
if I don't get back.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.756
I had the day off. If you want to go
to the beach or to the pier tonight...

21:57.280 --> 21:59.032
- Actually, I have a thing.
- A thing?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.395
Kirsten's dad is being honored
by some magazine.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.632
They're having a cocktail party
at the Cohen house.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.399
You...

22:07.560 --> 22:09.198
You want to come?

22:11.040 --> 22:12.155
Do you want me to come?

22:12.320 --> 22:15.949
- I'm kind of getting the vibe that...
- No. Yeah. No.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.998
It's just, you know what these things
are like, these people...

22:19.160 --> 22:20.798
And it might be kind of weird.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.316
The girl who serves food at the party
is now a guest at the party.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.799
I wasn't saying that.

22:25.960 --> 22:30.909
- I feel like you're not trying to invite me.
- No, I do. I am.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.116
I didn't think you'd want to go.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.157
I don't want to go.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.312
I want to make sure you're not
embarrassed to bring me to things.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.879
I'm not.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.589
Good. I have nothing to wear anyway.

22:44.520 --> 22:48.513
But come over after,
and we can both wear nothing.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.635
Well, if you keep looking up like that,
all you're gonna see is a bad shot.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.394
Hey, Hodes. How are things
at the DA's office?

23:04.560 --> 23:09.156
Better since you left the PD's office.
My people seem to win a few more.

23:09.360 --> 23:13.592
That's why I left.
I started feeling bad for you.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.116
So why don't I think it's a
wild coincidence to see you here?

23:17.320 --> 23:20.630
You have trust issues.
That's why you've never been married.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.191
Well, saves me a phone call.
We have a deal to offer your client.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.713
Client?

23:26.880 --> 23:28.313
Shaughnessy.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.358
- He's not my client.
- That's not what he said.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.433
He's drunk most of the time. You can't
take anything he says very seriously.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.990
We're taking what we think
he has to say very seriously.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.435
Just out of curiosity...

23:43.680 --> 23:45.750
...what kind of deal
were you gonna offer him?

23:45.920 --> 23:49.230
- Curiosity?
- Yeah, mild.

23:49.440 --> 23:54.150
Okay, if he were to cooperate, let us
know who signs his marching orders...

23:54.320 --> 23:56.231
...we'd plead him down
to a lesser charge.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.710
Unless the plaintiff decides
to drop the charges.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.677
Then he would have no reason to talk.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.116
Except the plaintiff has no reason
to do that. Right?

24:06.960 --> 24:11.988
Let me tell you something, Sandy. The
Newport Group is Orange County's Enron.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.276
You make this just a little
difficult for me...

24:14.440 --> 24:16.510
...and I'll come down on you
as hard as I can.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.069
- This must be a reelection year.
- Oh, spare me.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.115
You and I have been friends for years.
That's why Caleb Nichol hired you.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.636
It used to be, Sandy Cohen's moral
compass wouldn't point him anywhere...

24:26.800 --> 24:29.792
...except the direction of truth.
No matter who he took down.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.713
Spoken like a man
who's never been married.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.719
I just can't hit it any better than that.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.230
Good to see you again.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.997
- Hey, man, where you been?
- Theresa's.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.390
- Your parents say anything?
- No, I covered for you.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.233
You shouldn't do this.
You're sleeping there? That's serious.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.595
- I fell asleep.
- I heard about some scary guy...

24:54.760 --> 24:56.796
...that showed up at school.
Was it Eddie?

24:56.960 --> 24:58.234
- He came to talk.
- Yeah?

24:58.400 --> 25:00.914
About how it's getting serious
between you and Theresa?

25:01.080 --> 25:03.878
- You and Anna? You talk?
- Do not change the subject to me.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.110
I'm powerless not to talk
about it. I tried.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.350
She had a list of reasons
why she's leaving.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.158
- Didn't make the cut?
- She's lying.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.880
I want her to know that I'm sorry
I hurt her feelings.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.873
But she doesn't have to do this.
She shouldn't be doing this.

25:16.040 --> 25:19.237
- Then just tell her.
- Just tell her, huh?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.675
Simple. Honest.
No wonder I never considered it.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.355
Okay, fine. I'll tell her tonight.
Might have to have a little bubbly first.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.509
A little <i>veritas in vino</i>,
know what I mean?

25:26.680 --> 25:28.238
Hardly ever.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.078
Coming.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.434
Hey. Come in.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.755
- How are you?
- Good. What's going on?

25:42.920 --> 25:45.639
- Well, there's this party tonight, and...
- I heard.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.072
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe you'd want to go.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.357
I can't. I didn't really bring
any of my nice clothes with me.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.559
Well, I have some options.

26:06.560 --> 26:11.350
Hello? Hello? Hey, Joel.
Thanks for getting back to me.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.071
No, actually, now's a perfect time.

26:14.280 --> 26:18.432
- Come on. Smile for your father, Kiki.
- I'm smiling on the inside.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.113
<i>Veritas in vino.</i>

26:20.320 --> 26:22.197
Yeah. Then we have a deal?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.715
Why spend a lot of money when
you can make a lot?

26:24.880 --> 26:26.791
Yeah. Caleb'll be pleased.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.873
Yes, Mr. McKuin, I'm fully aware.
We do what we must.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.998
Theresa coming?

26:39.160 --> 26:41.037
Nope. Marissa?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.031
I doubt it.

26:44.360 --> 26:50.037
Look, I get why you're doing what
you're doing, but she does really love you.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.472
- I know. It's just...
- Yeah. The Oliver thing. I know.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.073
It was messed up.

26:56.240 --> 27:01.155
But, hey, she dated Luke for years.
You can't always trust her judgment.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.793
But she has a good heart.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.748
Not your typical back-yard barbecue.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.639
Yeah, well, they never are.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.753
You...

27:22.240 --> 27:23.958
I had some help.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.033
Coop.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.754
- That's a nice one, sir.
- Right here, please. Eyes right here.

27:33.920 --> 27:38.835
Come on, Seth. Get in the picture.
You are the future of the company.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.956
There's something to look forward to.

27:41.120 --> 27:44.032
You'll grow out of comic books
and grow into wanting to be rich.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.275
No, I won't.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.353
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.673
I just came to say goodbye.
My plane's leaving soon.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.956
- You're really leaving.
- Yeah.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.234
Well, you might not believe this,
but I'm gonna miss you.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.595
What's more unbelievable
is that I'm gonna miss you.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.398
Pretty unbelievable.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.870
- Bye, Blanche.
- See you, Rose.

28:11.840 --> 28:15.799
Have you seen Molly Miller's boob job?
They're huge.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.758
Lois Robin's face-lift?

28:18.920 --> 28:22.390
Diane Kahn totally had chin implants.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.879
They have chin implants?

28:24.040 --> 28:26.554
Oh, yeah. Chins are the new nose.
Haven't you heard?

28:26.720 --> 28:30.110
- Hey, Anna. Theresa.
- Nice to meet you.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.955
Came to say goodbye to Seth?

28:35.440 --> 28:37.237
Yeah.

28:37.720 --> 28:40.029
Could you give him this?

28:41.880 --> 28:44.269
It's supposed to say everything
that I couldn't say.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.839
But now that I'm here,
I just...

28:46.000 --> 28:48.514
...can't say anything at all.
- Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.270
See you, Ryan.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.835
Thanks for teaching me how to waltz.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.993
Have the best life. You deserve it.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.279
- Bye.
- Bye.

29:13.640 --> 29:16.154
You look so hot.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.710
Not here, Luke. Behave.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.440
I know. It's just...

29:23.200 --> 29:24.872
...your ass.

29:33.720 --> 29:37.554
We do all right.
Excuse me, guys. Thanks.

29:40.880 --> 29:44.190
I saw the DA today.
It didn't go what I would call "well."

29:44.360 --> 29:47.079
I thought he was your friend.
You made deals all the time.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.710
It's an election year. It seems you're
not too popular with the people.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.155
That the best you could do?
I need to make my toast.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.993
I'll make this go away,
but you'll have to give something up.

29:56.160 --> 30:00.711
Joel McKuin needs to be the chief supplier
for the next big Newport Group contract.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.156
You won't be buying wholesale,
but it'll work.

30:05.600 --> 30:09.388
- I knew I could rely on you.
- Not if you were Man of the Century.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.109
What's the matter, Sandy?
You cut deals for your clients all the time.

30:13.320 --> 30:17.757
Yeah, well, usually, they're the ones
that have broken the law, not me.

30:20.920 --> 30:24.515
Mr. Nichol, it's time for your speech.
Right this way.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.278
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure...

30:32.440 --> 30:35.159
- Hey, Jules.
- James.

30:35.320 --> 30:38.790
Now, forgive me, this can't
possibly be happening, right?

30:38.960 --> 30:43.636
- I'm crazy to even think it, right?
- Think what?

30:43.800 --> 30:48.476
Okay, that's what I thought.
Because it would destroy Marissa.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.793
We know she's been through enough.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.475
Honestly, Jimmy, I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:55.640 --> 30:59.394
- Now, Caleb's speaking.
- It really is a tremendous honor.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.471
Few publications better represent...

31:01.640 --> 31:05.519
...this great county of ours
than <i>Riviera Magazine.</i>

31:16.320 --> 31:18.675
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna give Seth his letter.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.877
Okay. I'll be here,
trying to spot the chin implants.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.480
My story has its own cast of characters.

31:25.640 --> 31:29.553
One doesn't become <i>Riviera</i> Man
of the Year without some help.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.950
Where would I be without
my wonderful family?

31:32.120 --> 31:34.350
My beautiful daughter Kirsten,
and my favorite...

31:34.520 --> 31:38.798
Well, my only grandson, Seth.
Come join me.

31:40.800 --> 31:43.872
- What are you doing here?
- I just want to talk. Can't you listen?

31:46.800 --> 31:49.837
- Let's go somewhere and figure this out.
- I'm not going anywhere.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.910
Stay the hell away from me. You're lucky
I don't kick your ass right here.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.196
- Look, can we please just go?
- Let go!

32:05.040 --> 32:06.951
What the hell is going on?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.916
Why don't you leave
before the cops get here.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.513
- You're dead!
- Right now.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.468
Don't ever come home. You're dead.
You hear me? Get off me, man.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.354
Oh, that's gonna be quite a shiner.
But, hey, they look good on you.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.669
Yeah? Thanks.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.479
I'm so sorry. About everything.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.756
Oh, it's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.391
Hey, I heard there was a rumble in the
bedroom. I'm gonna go break it up.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.193
You okay?

32:54.200 --> 32:57.158
- I can't believe Anna didn't show.
- Actually...

32:59.960 --> 33:02.679
- You're just giving me this now?
- I was a little distracted.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.553
The ink's all smudged.
I can't even read it.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.438
Is that a V or a Q?

33:12.600 --> 33:14.318
Okay, here, look. Right there.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.790
That says, "I love you." Then what
is that word? "Azerbaijan"? "Aztecs"?

33:17.960 --> 33:19.439
- Aspirin.
- It says "aspirin"?

33:19.600 --> 33:22.478
- You're giving me a headache.
- "Confucius"? What's this C-word?

33:22.640 --> 33:23.789
- Confusing?
- "Confusing"?

33:23.960 --> 33:26.952
No. You're confusing me.
What do you care what it says?

33:27.120 --> 33:29.839
Anna couldn't even say goodbye.
She's leaving because of me.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.070
- I don't want it to happen.
- What is going on?

33:32.280 --> 33:35.556
Last week, you're on a coffee cart
declaring your eternal love for me.

33:35.720 --> 33:38.678
Now you're all like,
"Anna's letter. I can't read it."

33:38.840 --> 33:43.231
This isn't like that, okay? She's just my
friend, and I don't want her to leave.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.352
Then go.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.397
Stop her.

33:53.680 --> 33:56.274
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I need to call Eddie.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.000
Try and straighten everything out.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.991
It's gonna be okay.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.389
I'm sorry to interrupt. I need you to drive
me to the airport. I gotta stop Anna.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.677
- You can't drive yourself?
- I've had three glasses of champagne.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.114
You know how it goes
straight to my head. Please.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.714
- You should go. He needs you.
- Thank you very much.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.273
You're gonna be at the motel
when I get back?

34:20.440 --> 34:22.510
I don't want you to be late.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.315
Hey, Juju.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.388
- I wondered if you'd ignore me all night.
- You seemed busy.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.391
- Congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.152
Can I drive you home?

34:44.840 --> 34:47.956
- I can walk down the driveway.
- Can I call you?

34:48.440 --> 34:51.398
Take you out on a real date?
Things have gotten a bit crazy.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.757
Now, I know I didn't appreciate you.
I want to.

34:55.239 --> 34:57.800
I want to make you feel appreciated.

34:58.240 --> 35:02.916
Plan the perfect date, run it by me.
We'll see.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.191
Come on, man. Her flight leaves soon.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.913
I'm doing 75 in a 65, all right?

35:17.080 --> 35:19.514
"I'm doing 75 in a..."
Everyone knows 80 is the new 75.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.399
- What? Who talks like that?
- What is up with this a.c.?

35:22.560 --> 35:24.710
My Jewfro is frizzing out.
I look like Screech.

35:24.880 --> 35:27.189
- The a.c.'s fine.
- What is this music?

35:27.480 --> 35:30.392
Do not insult Journey. All right?

35:36.120 --> 35:38.509
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.672
How are you?

35:41.840 --> 35:46.436
Just embarrassed. I can't believe it,
this huge fight at a fancy party.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.398
Actually not the first time
that's happened.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.790
Here. I'm not gonna have time
to get it dry-cleaned before I go.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.679
Before you go?

35:56.160 --> 35:59.470
I've been fooling myself thinking
this was gonna be easy.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.278
I made a huge mess of everything, and...

36:03.440 --> 36:06.955
...I have this whole life to figure out.
And so does Ryan.

36:07.160 --> 36:11.199
So take care of him.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.555
I'll see you.

36:28.040 --> 36:31.749
I talked to my dad.
He told me what you did.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.798
Obstructed justice.
Tampered with a witness.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.752
So, what happens now?

36:36.920 --> 36:41.118
My guess is, not much. Since it's an
election year, the DA can't afford to lose.

36:41.440 --> 36:44.159
And without this star witness,
they don't really have a case.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.715
And if you're gonna go
after the king, Caleb...

36:46.880 --> 36:49.189
...then you had better know
you can kill the king.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.430
I told you I didn't want you
to get involved.

36:51.600 --> 36:55.309
- I do what's best for my family.
- I'd rather go to jail than be responsible...

36:55.480 --> 36:59.996
...for you being mixed up in this,
getting into bed with my father.

37:00.160 --> 37:05.234
I promise you, I'd rather send you to jail
than get into bed with your father.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.715
You do something like this,
there's no going back.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.509
Yeah. It's kind of like prom night.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.875
Believe me.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.998
If anybody's gonna be putting
you in handcuffs...

37:27.160 --> 37:29.720
...it's gonna be me.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.638
Anna!

37:56.360 --> 38:00.148
- Anna, wait.
- Seth? Hold on.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.875
Seth, what are you doing here?

38:04.040 --> 38:09.592
Okay. Maybe it's just the champagne
talking, but I'm just gonna say it. Okay?

38:10.240 --> 38:12.913
- Please do not leave because of me.
- What? What are you...?

38:13.080 --> 38:15.071
You love me. I read it. And I get it. Okay?

38:15.240 --> 38:19.279
And I'm so sorry if I did anything
to hurt your feelings. Or cause this.

38:19.440 --> 38:21.908
But I don't want you to leave.
Okay? None of us do.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.959
Seth, I love you as a friend.

38:26.920 --> 38:30.276
- What?
- God, I love you as a friend.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.715
That doesn't say "Azerbaijan"?

38:34.520 --> 38:40.755
Look, I think you're an amazing guy.
A little self-absorbed, maybe, but great.

38:41.080 --> 38:44.755
But, I mean, if there's one thing that
our relationship taught me, it's that...

38:44.920 --> 38:47.354
...we don't have a lot of chemistry.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.232
So you're not leaving because of me?

38:49.600 --> 38:51.955
I'm leaving because I need to leave.

38:52.120 --> 38:55.669
But who knows? Maybe one day,
we'll be perfect for each other.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.197
I don't know.

38:59.760 --> 39:02.718
I do know I have to go to Pittsburgh.

39:03.280 --> 39:08.638
I'm Ionely, Seth. I thought
I could make this my home, but I can't.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.509
Thanks for coming...

39:14.240 --> 39:16.276
...and saying goodbye.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.316
Anna, wait a second.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.393
What am I gonna do without you?
Who will I play Jenga with?

39:39.560 --> 39:42.757
You're so wise. All your sage wisdom.
What am I gonna do without that?

39:42.920 --> 39:44.512
Confidence, Cohen.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.389
Anna!

40:20.440 --> 40:22.670
I'll be right back.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.957
What if the girl I'm supposed to be with
just went back to Pittsburgh?

40:48.120 --> 40:50.076
What if she went back to Chino?

40:51.080 --> 40:53.196
Why would Anna go to Chino?

40:54.120 --> 40:57.317
- I'm kidding. Come on.
- Nice one.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.358
Well, at least we have each other.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.030
Actually, I have Summer now.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.670
But I'll put a little Seth-Ryan time
on the books.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.513
- That's quality time.
- Thanks, buddy.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.875
I could always hang out with Luke.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.828
What do you think he's doing right now?

41:17.320 --> 41:19.311
Discovering fire?

41:20.200 --> 41:22.316
Hunting and gathering?

41:23.120 --> 41:27.193
Shaving his chest with a Buck Knife?
You guys could do that together.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.396
I do do that.
