it would come
down to you.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.216
That's absurd.

15:32.808 --> 15:33.843
Now here you are.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.850
The man who will spark
the revolution!

15:37.437 --> 15:38.847
Look, Kagame used me.

15:39.022 --> 15:41.013
That was the extent of
our relationship.

15:42.234 --> 15:43.223
You were comrades.

15:45.695 --> 15:49.187
Without your vision,
there would be
no Liber8.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.398
Well, it seems to me that
Sonya's got that covered.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.823
(SCOFFS) Sonya.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.988
Do you want to know
why Sonya thinks she
sees your destiny?

15:57.499 --> 16:01.788
Sonya believes that
she traveled here
from the future.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.954
How can you trust
someone like that?

16:08.176 --> 16:09.382
And you're
the alternative?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.555
Not me, no.

16:13.807 --> 16:14.842
But be careful.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.560
She will pin her name
on your manifesto.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.769
She wants the world
to believe that she
is their savior.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.568
And if she has
to kill you
to do it...

16:32.075 --> 16:33.064
You're lying.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.076
It's supposed
to be you.

16:45.422 --> 16:46.787
It always has.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.855
Yes. Yes, of course.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.147
Right away.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.282
Kagame wants
you to go.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.474
Anything?

17:49.611 --> 17:51.397
Well, I'm linked into
the city's cameras

17:51.488 --> 17:54.525
using the RCMP's
face recognition program.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.315
Problem is, it's really,
really slow.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.446
One camera located Julian,
but by the time

17:59.537 --> 18:03.200
the software was able
to ID him and report it,
an hour had passed.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.743
Too late.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.041
Stay on it.
We might get lucky.

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

18:18.306 --> 18:19.341
Hello?

18:20.725 --> 18:21.714
I need help.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.842
Julian, where are you?

18:25.105 --> 18:26.436
Look, will you
meet me or not?

18:29.734 --> 18:31.065
Great, thanks
for your help.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.275
All right, that was a
reporter friend of mine,

18:33.363 --> 18:35.695
she said the manifesto
came from a
proxy server.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.732
Hello?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.365
What ifyou could
save tens of
thousands of people?

18:44.541 --> 18:46.031
Yeah, who wouldn't
want to do that?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.582
Even if it meant
killing one person?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.043
I know this game.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.620
lfyou could go
back in time
and kill Hitler?

18:52.966 --> 18:55.002
What's your answer?
lwould kill Hitler.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.756
But what he did happened.
Hitler killed millions.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.214
What Theseus did is a matter
of record in my time.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.885
Kiera. You said it yourself.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.141
Certain events in history
have already been altered.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.689
Now, what if Julian's future
is one of those things?

19:12.694 --> 19:14.776
And what if the victims
were people you cared about?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.444
Yeah, but how do you
know that for sure?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.279
It's usually the victors
who write history.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.989
Because it happened to me.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.484
People that were close
to my parents were killed

19:22.746 --> 19:24.327
at the massacre
in New Pemberton.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.080
I'm sorry.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.793
I can't believe I'm actually
defending that little
shit bird who shot me,

19:31.880 --> 19:35.418
but right now,
Julian is a scared kid.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.760
Fear is a powerful
motivator.

19:38.928 --> 19:43.262
Kiera, let's do our part
and find Julian, okay?

19:46.394 --> 19:50.228
Arc. Alec can find
him using Arc.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.478
Kiera? Kier...

19:51.691 --> 19:54.433
Alec?
Where are you?

19:59.616 --> 20:00.696
Hey.

20:04.913 --> 20:05.948
You okay?

20:06.039 --> 20:08.576
Apart from being shot at,
hunted and generally despised,

20:09.125 --> 20:10.160
yeah, I'm great.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.455
How's Mom, though?

20:14.005 --> 20:14.994
Recovering.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.797
She took a bullet for me.

20:18.927 --> 20:21.134
Yeah, I guess she thinks
you're worth saving.

20:22.806 --> 20:23.841
Do you?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.132
Cameron!

20:34.150 --> 20:35.139
Any news?

20:37.862 --> 20:40.353
You planning on hunting down
Julian Randol on your own?

20:44.536 --> 20:47.494
Are you thinking about
hunting down Julian Randol
on your own?

20:51.626 --> 20:52.957
You wanna
face him alone?

20:53.503 --> 20:54.788
It's not that
straightforward.

20:56.131 --> 20:59.168
Look, I understand the
feeling, Cameron. I do.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.668
He helped Kagame murder
hundreds of innocent people.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.596
But ifyou actually think
this is a viable option,

21:06.683 --> 21:08.765
l have no choice
but to confine
you to desk duty

21:08.852 --> 21:09.841
until this is resolved.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.177
That won't be necessary.

Detective, could you
give us a second please?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.188
(DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)

21:31.374 --> 21:32.614
We're on the
same side, Kiera.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.122
There is a plan in motion
for Julian Randol.

21:37.088 --> 21:40.251
He's going to tell
Rosicki and Martinez
everything we wanna know.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.503
Understood?

21:44.637 --> 21:45.626
You're sure?

21:45.722 --> 21:47.883
We're gonna get
all the information
we need about Liber8.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.092
Trust me. It's gonna
go our way.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.408
Got him!

22:41.903 --> 22:42.938
What are you
gonna do?

22:43.279 --> 22:46.191
Honestly, it seems like
everyone's thought of a
next step for me

22:46.282 --> 22:47.897
except for myself.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.277
Maybe it's time you did.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.485
What kind of life
do you want
for yourself?

22:51.955 --> 22:53.365
How about making
my own choices

22:53.456 --> 22:55.117
without someone
telling me who
I'm supposed to be?

22:57.919 --> 22:59.705

to find my path,

No luck finding
JuHan,huh?

23:38.710 --> 23:40.246
Did Betty feed
you the intel?

23:40.628 --> 23:41.617
What're you
talking about?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.915
Dillon told me.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.839
You're going to get
Julian to talk,
any means necessary,

23:47.552 --> 23:48.758

could use my help.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.181
This is
the right
thing to do.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.845
He's not some
innocent kid.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.518

capable of could
hurt a lot of people,

23:59.606 --> 24:01.016
and I want to
prevent that
from happening.

what needs to be done?

go to waste.

what I do,

some people will always
think of me as a terrorist.

I have Asperger's?

come right out
and say it but...

some books in her

disappointed her.

hadn't got caught
in the middle of all this.

disappointed with.

a destiny to fulfill,

that there is.

were ready to do

that is killing this city

you cut it out.
