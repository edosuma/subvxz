WEBVTT

00:40.499 --> 00:43.582
(knock on door)

00:43.669 --> 00:45.910
(clears throat)

00:52.261 --> 00:54.593
Welcome home,
Dwighty boy.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.264
I gotta say,

00:59.351 --> 01:02.389
it is damn good
having you back.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.688
See,
things gotta get done.

01:06.775 --> 01:11.520
I need my top guys
out in front acing that shit.

01:11.613 --> 01:15.322
Thanks.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.985
Had yourself
a close call,

01:20.080 --> 01:21.491
lhean

01:21.582 --> 01:23.823
I got ambushed.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.828
I took this.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.661
The rest
didn't walk away.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.211
Well, until...

01:30.299 --> 01:33.417
I got to the woods,
kept going.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.218
You know,
I headed toward Hilltop.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.841
I figured
our people would be

01:37.931 --> 01:40.013
putting up a blockade
sooner or later.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.056
Good job.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.639
But we pulled the blockade.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.565
Have to let the mice
play a little,

01:49.651 --> 01:52.234
'cause, you know...

01:52.321 --> 01:56.064
our people need
to get their business in order.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.650
You'll see.

01:59.745 --> 02:04.034
So, why don't you just
slug a beer,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.456
put on your best vest,
and get your ass downstairs,

02:06.543 --> 02:08.454
'cause like I said...

02:10.047 --> 02:12.129
...we got work.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.799
(walker growling)

02:18.722 --> 02:20.679
(gurgling)

02:20.766 --> 02:23.007
Negan:
Get 'em good.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.717
It's all right
if they spill out.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.678
I'm gonna gather up the jackpots
for refreshers,

02:27.773 --> 02:31.311
and guts is guts.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.190
Push it in nice and deep.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.702
That's the stuff.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.371
Holy damn!

02:45.457 --> 02:48.165
This is gonna be
all kinds of awesome.

02:48.251 --> 02:52.290
Once the Hilltop just feels the
tip of what we are packin'...

02:52.381 --> 02:54.088
uaughs)

02:54.174 --> 02:58.088
...they are gonna drop
to their knees lickety-split.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.512
Simon: Yes, sir.
Ha ha.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.388
(walkers growling)

03:32.212 --> 03:34.294
Simon:
Listen up!

03:34.381 --> 03:38.545
Today is about
scaring these people.

03:38.635 --> 03:43.129
We're not going for head shots,
just flesh wounds.

03:43.223 --> 03:48.764
Hit a few, leave 'em livin',
let 'em turn.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.936
But don't kill 'em.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.562
ID-

03:56.653 --> 03:58.564
Negan's handling
his own transport,

03:58.655 --> 04:00.441
so you can
ride with me.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.569
Well,
I'm gonna scout ahead,

04:02.659 --> 04:04.320
see if anything's
coming our way.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.776
Well,
considerate thought,

04:05.871 --> 04:07.987
but we got scouts scouting,
right?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.287
(chuckles)

04:09.374 --> 04:11.160
Far more expendable soldiers
than you,

04:11.251 --> 04:15.245
which is not to say
you're expendable-- at all.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.375
Listen, ride with me,

04:17.466 --> 04:20.458
we make sure
you're up to speed on the plan.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.007
It's what Negan wants,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.803
so I don't know
why we're still jawing.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.177
He says, we do.

04:37.152 --> 04:41.942
(engine starts)

04:42.032 --> 04:43.193
(laps door)

04:43.283 --> 04:46.526
(walkers growling in distance)

04:51.917 --> 04:53.908
(engine starts)

04:54.002 --> 04:57.245
(walkers growling)

05:33.750 --> 05:36.333
You look beautiful, baby.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.037
(theme music playing)

06:18.920 --> 06:22.254
(door creaking)

06:49.701 --> 06:52.944
(indistinct conversation)

06:53.038 --> 06:54.745
(hammer clanging)

07:03.465 --> 07:05.672
Come here, sweetheart.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.172
Yeah.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.629
(smooches)

07:36.665 --> 07:39.077
(breathes deeply)

07:47.092 --> 07:48.799
You know, I...

07:48.885 --> 07:51.217
I look around and...

07:51.304 --> 07:54.092
I think about the people
that are gone...

07:56.309 --> 07:58.471
...and the people
that are still here.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.347
It ain't right.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.682
And it ain't fair.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.479
Look,about"

08:09.572 --> 08:11.028
what I did at Sanctuary,

08:11.116 --> 08:13.483
trying to end it
real quick...

08:15.495 --> 08:18.408
I just wanted it done.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.411
I didn't want
to give them another chance,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.333
not again.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.293
And I didn't care
who was there.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.294
I don't know
if that makes it right or--

08:30.385 --> 08:31.750
It does.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.052
I didn't want to risk
killing innocent people.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.256
I should've just been
worrying about our people.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.388
Hell with anyone else.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.059
We'll keep fighting--

08:42.147 --> 08:43.558
until you're ready.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.356
I'm ready.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.185
Maggie's got lookouts
out there.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.644
Every half-mile,

08:50.739 --> 08:52.446
waiting to signal each other,
I know.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.069
Yeah. I'm going, too.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.743
To make sure
we're all ready.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.867
I'll go with you.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.290
We should split up.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.960
We're covering as much ground
as we can.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.336
All right.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.882
I'm okay.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.385
Yeah?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.311
Okay-

09:24.397 --> 09:26.388
I'm gonna be okay.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.402
Daryl...

09:33.907 --> 09:36.114
Thank you--

09:36.201 --> 09:38.408
for getting them here.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.210
Think he'll come back
from this?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.806
Have you come back?

10:05.396 --> 10:07.808
I just keep going.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.981
Yeah.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.989
They will, too.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.946
It'll be harder
after we finish this,

10:24.040 --> 10:26.031
when it's quiet.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.248
Not if Negan's dead.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.831
Not for me, at least.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.836
Not for me, either.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.011
What do you make
of this, D?

11:26.102 --> 11:27.968
This?

11:28.062 --> 11:31.100
This.
Our little road trip?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.017
Opportunity to close.
Nothing wrong with that.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.272
(scoffs)

11:36.362 --> 11:37.944
Come on, D.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.022
Let's rap here.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.073
Let's get candid.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.026
Let's get weird.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.704
There's nobody here
but us chickens.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.076
Top guy to top guy,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.833
I just want to know if,
in your analysis,

11:55.924 --> 11:59.713
you believe these people
are gonna cower and cave

11:59.802 --> 12:04.046
after we deliver what amounts
to yet another warning.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.882
- Don't get paid to think.
- Not true.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.182
Not true.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.885
I value
your perspective, Dwight.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.471
You've been
on both sides of the iron.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.855
Well,
if you're not gonna answer,

12:17.946 --> 12:20.062
let me
extemporaneously express

12:20.156 --> 12:22.488
that I have my doubts
this little maneuver

12:22.575 --> 12:25.533
is going to deliver
the desired outcome.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.486
You think
we should do it different?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.288
No. No, no.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.615
Not at all.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.291
The big man's plan
will get it done,

12:33.378 --> 12:34.960
no question.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.676
We've thrown
a lot at Rick,

12:46.766 --> 12:49.098
the widow, the King,

12:49.185 --> 12:52.894
and they just keep coming,
keep fighting--

12:52.981 --> 12:54.688
you've seen it,
I've seen it.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.108
Tallying it up,
I keep seeing the same answer--

12:58.194 --> 13:00.435
they don't scare.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.908
(insects chirping)

13:06.995 --> 13:10.784
(door creaks)

13:13.876 --> 13:17.619
(brakes squeal,
engine shuts off)

13:19.632 --> 13:21.999
I don't know
what the hell it is.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.128
"If you fill the crates
with food or phonograph records,

13:26.222 --> 13:28.463
I will gladly exchange them
for a key to your future"?

13:28.558 --> 13:30.469
It lists coordinates
for our meeting spot.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.353
This isn't the Saviors.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.151
They'd blow
through the gates,

13:41.237 --> 13:42.773
make a big show.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.354
This isn't that.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.565
I wouldn't put
nothin' past them.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.866
Well, if it is a trap,
it's kind of obvious.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.819
Which is
what could make it a trap.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.952
What if...

13:55.043 --> 13:58.035
What if it's someone
who actually wants to help?

13:58.129 --> 14:01.167
If someone is trying to help us
and we miss out,

14:01.257 --> 14:02.588
we miss out.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.586
If somebody's trying
to kill us,

14:04.677 --> 14:05.963
we die.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.466
Not if we're careful.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.797
Being careful
is staying here.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.801
I'll go.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.978
- I'll see what's up.
- You go, I go.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.057
- Rick wants us here.
- I know.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.767
But the last time
we took a chance like this,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.772
it changed everything.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.979
Rick didn't agree
with me then.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.610
He may not
understand me <i>now.</i>

14:27.700 --> 14:29.190
He won't.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.778
But eventually,
he will.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.613
He will.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.918
Jesus and the others
have been scavenging,

14:41.005 --> 14:43.212
and we're still starving.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.007
Maybe this person does have
something that can help.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.960
Then,
I'm coming with you.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.294
Okay-

14:49.389 --> 14:52.222
I'll grab records,
case this is real.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.352
You get extra clips
in case it isn't.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.179
Man: If you see 'em coming,
hit your horn.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.434
<i>That'll start the handoff.</i>

15:00.525 --> 15:03.643
<i>Stick to the plan, don't engage.</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:07.070
(vehicles approaching)

15:35.143 --> 15:37.555
(engine starts)

15:58.124 --> 16:02.038
(tires screeching)

16:03.504 --> 16:05.461
<i>Arat:
The hell was that?</i>

16:05.548 --> 16:07.084
That was Negan's car.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.291
Jesus, it was.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.547
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

16:11.637 --> 16:13.924
Damn it!

16:27.570 --> 16:30.528
You see it? Yeah, someone pegged him--
pegged him good.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.526
Looked like just one guy,
from what I could tell.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.858
<i>Anyone see
which way he went?</i>

16:34.952 --> 16:36.113
(brakes squeal)

16:36.204 --> 16:37.569
Just tell them
to pipe down!

16:37.663 --> 16:38.824
Stay I¢Y-

16:38.915 --> 16:40.747
May be more of them
out there.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.325
Keep guards up,
scan your lane.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.786
We could have company.

16:50.510 --> 16:56.256
(brakes squealing)

16:56.349 --> 16:58.556
(engine shuts off, door opens)

16:58.643 --> 17:01.135
Let's go.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.940
Whoa!
Stand down.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.940
No runnin' off
without a plan.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.364
Car hit Megan's,
pushed him off the road.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.612
They headed that way.
Couldn't have gotten far.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.363
Then, what are
we waiting for?

17:18.454 --> 17:19.944
(sighs)
It was just one driver.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.156
It's nothing
Negan can't handle on his own.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.412
But just in case,

17:24.502 --> 17:26.617
Dwight and I'll go
check it out.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.373
- All right, we can back you up and--
- No.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.172
This might be a ploy
to divide our forces,

17:31.259 --> 17:32.966
and we're not
gonna let that happen,

17:33.052 --> 17:36.966
not when we're so close
to the master stroke.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.799
I turned my truck to make sure
no one comes in this way.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.510
Gary, I want you to do the same
down that end.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.019
You're in charge.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.602
Keep everyone in tight,
create a perimeter,

17:51.696 --> 17:54.313
cut down anything
that comes close.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.198
Shall we locate
our benefactor?

18:43.748 --> 18:46.240
(walkers growling)

18:53.341 --> 18:55.833
(walkers growling)

18:55.926 --> 18:58.213
(machine-gun fire continues)

19:00.139 --> 19:02.597
(growling continues)

19:02.683 --> 19:04.265
(gun cocks)

19:08.189 --> 19:10.681
HYah!
(grunts)

19:12.276 --> 19:14.017
(gunshots)

19:16.072 --> 19:18.860
(gunshots)

19:18.949 --> 19:22.692
(walkers growling)

19:29.168 --> 19:30.658
(gun clicking)

19:30.753 --> 19:34.337
uaughs)

19:34.423 --> 19:36.084
Hey, prick.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.587
You are out of bullets.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.222
Come on up.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.719
(grunts)

19:50.106 --> 19:51.517
(wood clattering)

19:51.607 --> 19:53.564
Lucille!

19:53.651 --> 19:56.643
(wood creaking)

19:56.737 --> 19:58.728
(grunts)

20:05.538 --> 20:08.326
Oh, you asshole.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.580
(body thuds)

20:28.853 --> 20:30.764
(brakes squeal)

20:30.855 --> 20:33.142
Michonne: Okay.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.313
(engine shuts off)

21:05.473 --> 21:07.180
My name is Georgie,

21:07.266 --> 21:10.384
and these are my friends,
Hilda and Midge.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.843
And you are?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.181
Suspicious.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.186
But curious enough

21:18.277 --> 21:21.395
to see what I have to offer
for food and music.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.400
I do hope
the records are music.

21:23.491 --> 21:26.074
I don't accept spoken word.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.321
If you're out here,

21:27.411 --> 21:29.118
you know
you can take care of yourselves,

21:29.205 --> 21:30.536
and I like that.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.240
I don't care
to share this with the weak.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.917
Good.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.885
Enid.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.646
None for me.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.358
Give us
what you have.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.159
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.408
I come bearing knowledge
to trade--

22:12.498 --> 22:15.206
essential knowledge
for the future,

22:15.292 --> 22:16.874
primarily in my head,

22:16.961 --> 22:20.204
and, uh, I prefer
to keep that where it is.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.163
You're trading knowledge.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.669
That's what I have.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.625
I've made the same offer
before--

22:25.719 --> 22:27.335
fill the crates,
get the knowledge--

22:27.429 --> 22:28.669
simple as that.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.254
It's not a trick,
just a fair trade.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.589
I promise you.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.425
It's an act
of benevolence.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.305
Why would you do that?

22:38.399 --> 22:41.767
What else should I do?

22:47.575 --> 22:49.816
Rosita.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.157
(van door opens)

22:54.248 --> 22:56.580
Uh, what's in there
isn't part of the deal.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.658
There is no deal.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.915
How many communities
have you found?

23:02.006 --> 23:04.498
Communities like yours?

23:04.592 --> 23:06.708
Not many at all.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.794
And not one
for a very long time.

23:09.889 --> 23:14.133
What you have
is special, unusual.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.308
The dead have brought out
our best and worst,

23:16.395 --> 23:19.478
and the worst has been
outpacing the best lately,

23:19.565 --> 23:21.476
but that won't last forever.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.978
It won't.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.936
If, perhaps, people can
believe in people again,

23:27.031 --> 23:29.944
four crates of goods
is worth far less

23:30.034 --> 23:31.945
than a sustainable future

23:32.036 --> 23:35.825
and perhaps
an exercise in trust.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.328
I know..

23:39.418 --> 23:41.534
"Trust" probably sounds like
a made-up word now,

23:41.629 --> 23:43.290
like flibberschticky.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.337
Or klompf.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.665
Or moisture.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.967
Enid: Stop.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.965
This isn't real.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.172
No way anyone survives

23:54.266 --> 23:56.177
going around
doing what you say you're doing.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.975
But we do.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.975
And we will,
because I can divine

24:01.065 --> 24:04.274
that you are a fine group,

24:04.360 --> 24:07.603
manners notwithstanding.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.027
We can make a deal.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.197
No.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.248
These people and their van

24:21.335 --> 24:23.372
are coming with us
back to Hilltop.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.046
(Negan whistling)

24:33.138 --> 24:35.596
(lighter clicks)

24:35.683 --> 24:39.017
(walkers growling in distance)

24:40.521 --> 24:43.013
You still alive?

24:44.108 --> 24:46.099
I'm a goddamn cat.

24:46.193 --> 24:50.357
(growling continues)

24:50.447 --> 24:51.608
(lighter clicks)

24:51.699 --> 24:53.440
Come on, baby.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.275
Where are you?

24:55.369 --> 24:57.406
(walker growling)

24:57.496 --> 24:59.828
(wood clattering)

25:10.092 --> 25:13.460
So,
where's your people?

25:13.554 --> 25:16.012
They should
be here by now.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.260
We didn't get that far.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.216
Oh, they're coming.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.017
This is where you die...

25:22.104 --> 25:23.265
(walker growling, thudding)

25:23.355 --> 25:26.143
...in the dark,
all alone.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.851
What the hell
is your problem, Rick?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.277
- (walker growling, thudding)
- Huh?

25:32.364 --> 25:35.277
I mean, I know you're
working through some shit--

25:35.367 --> 25:37.074
the worst kind of shit,
I know--

25:37.161 --> 25:40.279
but if you aren't the most
stubborn know-it-all prick

25:40.372 --> 25:43.034
I've ever
crossed dicks with...

25:43.125 --> 25:46.288
Why didn't you just
let me save you, Rick?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.119
I'm good at it.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.454
I saved everybody
at the Sanctuary,

25:50.549 --> 25:52.085
the Outpost,
Hilltop, Kingdom--

25:52.176 --> 25:53.541
I saved them all.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.501
Their kids...
(walker growling, thudding)

25:55.596 --> 25:56.836
...can grow up safe.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.673
They didn't lose one
after we took over.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.679
All those people

26:02.770 --> 26:06.479
were doing just fine
before Rick Grimes!

26:06.565 --> 26:09.899
(lighter clicks)

26:09.985 --> 26:14.980
(muffled walkers growling)

26:25.209 --> 26:26.620
(rod clangs)

26:28.212 --> 26:29.919
You've not only
failed your boy,

26:30.005 --> 26:32.747
you failed
your people, Rick.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.755
Kind of makes me sick
just thinking about it.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.509
All that
wasted potential.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.593
But, see,
there is still hope for you.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.525
A one-time deal
that I will make

26:53.612 --> 26:55.523
in the memory
of your bad-ass son,

26:55.614 --> 26:58.447
someone that
I actually respected.

27:00.452 --> 27:04.161
You get Hilltop, Kingdom,
Alexandria to fall in line,

27:04.248 --> 27:06.535
and our arrangement
is back in place,

27:06.625 --> 27:09.617
and you are forgiven,
Rick.

27:11.630 --> 27:15.464
I will lower my take
from 50% to 25%"

27:15.551 --> 27:17.963
a lousy 25%.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.966
But you,
you got to come work for me.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.299
Janitorial to start--
not bad at all.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.554
Your people,

27:25.644 --> 27:28.011
they get to live
like 75% kings!

27:28.105 --> 27:32.394
Now, that is an epic freakin'
Christmas-Hanukah-Kwanzaa gift

27:32.484 --> 27:34.066
all rolled up into one,

27:34.153 --> 27:37.566
considering what a thorn
in my ass cheek you've all been.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.866
Now, why would I trust
any deal offered to me

27:41.952 --> 27:45.490
after what you did
to Jadis' people?

27:47.082 --> 27:49.790
The hell
are you talking about?

27:49.877 --> 27:51.333
The Scavengers.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.412
You killed them--
all of them.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.294
A whole community
just wiped out.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.349
Is that
how you "save" people?

28:07.436 --> 28:08.801
(whispering)
Son of a bitch.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.012
Still just me and you...

28:11.106 --> 28:13.814
even though plenty of
your people must've seen you go.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.609
See-- See,
it's times like this,

28:16.695 --> 28:19.312
you realize
who your true friends are.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.531
No one's coming
for you.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.359
(walker growling, thudding)

28:26.955 --> 28:29.367
(chuckles)

28:54.399 --> 28:56.515
You must've
thought about it,

28:56.610 --> 28:58.146
clipping him yourself.

29:00.656 --> 29:04.069
You mean
when he took my wife?

29:04.159 --> 29:06.446
Or burned my face?

29:06.536 --> 29:08.948
(sarcastically) No.

29:09.039 --> 29:12.498
Never thought about that.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.370
Not once.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.665
But you didn't
because you chose to survive

29:20.759 --> 29:23.877
instead of focusing on
past discomforts.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.587
You are an adult.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.218
You did
what you had to to live.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.598
And yet our leader
is not doing the same.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.397
If it was my call...

29:36.483 --> 29:38.815
we'd say enough.

29:39.903 --> 29:42.110
We'd branch out,
we'd find new places,

29:42.197 --> 29:45.280
we'd make
new relationships.

29:45.367 --> 29:49.907
We'd make sure
the Saviors survive,

29:49.997 --> 29:52.204
as you chose to.

29:53.208 --> 29:57.122
And we'd move on
from past discomforts as you...

29:57.212 --> 29:58.919
wisely chose to.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.623
(chuckles)

30:06.471 --> 30:09.088
Well, here I am,

30:09.182 --> 30:10.923
my nuts
blowin' in the breeze,

30:11.018 --> 30:12.804
naked as a jaybird.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.225
What do you say?

30:22.237 --> 30:24.478
Just move on?

30:28.452 --> 30:30.819
Just move on.

30:40.047 --> 30:43.290
(sighs)

30:51.892 --> 30:55.135
(liquid splashing)

31:09.076 --> 31:11.488
Could be his.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.449
Or the bucket
he brought with him.

31:21.088 --> 31:24.126
He could be anywhere,
alive or dead.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.207
Somewhere in between.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.417
Just 'cause he walked away

31:28.512 --> 31:30.799
doesn't mean
he's breathing.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.803
We can keep looking,

31:34.893 --> 31:37.009
maybe find him
more alive than dead,

31:37.104 --> 31:39.220
but then what?

31:39.314 --> 31:42.227
We could face
a distasteful moment.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.108
Or we could walk away.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.819
Get back to our people

31:51.910 --> 31:54.823
and make things
even better.

31:54.913 --> 31:59.157
This is a critical point
in our history, Dwight.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.460
This is something we could
tell our grandkids about.

32:03.547 --> 32:07.211
(walker growling in distance)

32:21.815 --> 32:23.897
(lighter clicks)

32:28.738 --> 32:31.981
(walker growling)

32:50.177 --> 32:52.509
Good answer.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.839
(growling continues)

33:16.828 --> 33:19.160
(door creaks)

33:19.247 --> 33:20.737
The handoff horn
started up

33:20.832 --> 33:22.448
but no confirmation hits.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.624
Saviors could've
slowed their roll.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.793
Let 'em.
We'll slow 'em down more.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.291
That's good.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.997
Be dark soon.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.754
Get people ready.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.835
You know what to do.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.257
We should make the deal
and let them go

33:39.351 --> 33:41.513
before
the Saviors get here.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.219
I can't let her go,

33:43.313 --> 33:45.224
not with what they have.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.397
I got too many mouths to feed.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.063
They have crates of food
in that van.

33:51.154 --> 33:54.146
People here
could be starving soon.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.027
Maggie's right.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.577
We take their stuff.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.372
Otherwise,
someone else will.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.041
Someone else will kill them.

34:06.127 --> 34:08.458
It's a miracle
they're still alive, anyways.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.379
The Saviors are on their way.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.594
We're gonna fight,
and some of us will die,

34:18.681 --> 34:20.264
so why
should we give a shit

34:20.350 --> 34:22.808
about people who don't
give a shit about themselves?

34:22.893 --> 34:24.931
I mean, out there,
living like that?

34:25.021 --> 34:26.978
We take their stuff,
and we use it.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.978
We stop pretending
that things just work out.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.524
They don't.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.397
Carl rescued Siddiq,

34:33.487 --> 34:36.400
and now
we have doctor,

34:36.491 --> 34:38.902
and we have a friend.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.666
Carl was brave.

34:49.754 --> 34:51.995
(voice breaking)
And now he's dead.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.253
Step back.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.558
(door creaks)

35:05.645 --> 35:08.012
(door closes)

35:08.106 --> 35:11.940
Maggie:
Things don't just work out.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.859
No.

35:17.949 --> 35:21.362
No, they don't.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.448
But I think he knew that.

35:29.336 --> 35:33.955
He didn't give up
on who Rick wanted him to be.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.040
And we can't

35:36.134 --> 35:39.047
on who he wanted us to be.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.469
We can't.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.277
Rick:
What you have...

36:01.368 --> 36:05.783
oh, that was never
gonna last.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.909
Sooner or later,

36:07.999 --> 36:11.708
you were gonna meet
someone like me.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.957
You can't save me

36:14.047 --> 36:17.711
or my people
or even yours.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.168
You can't save anyone,

36:20.261 --> 36:23.549
<i>because you don't care
about anyone.</i>

36:23.640 --> 36:28.510
You use people
to bring food...

36:28.603 --> 36:32.517
to sleep with you...

36:32.607 --> 36:35.315
to protect you.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.939
The only thing
you care about...

36:38.029 --> 36:40.191
is this bat.

36:40.281 --> 36:44.195
You can't even
save that.

36:44.285 --> 36:47.528
I'll make you a deal.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.614
I'll let you
kiss her goodbye.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.121
Don't you touch her!

36:55.213 --> 36:57.796
(match strikes)

36:57.882 --> 36:59.338
(flames roar)

36:59.426 --> 37:01.667
Come and get her.

37:04.264 --> 37:07.973
(walkers growling)

37:08.059 --> 37:09.800
Shit, no!
(wood cracks)

37:13.565 --> 37:16.808
(walkers growling)

37:27.162 --> 37:29.199
Get your hands
off of her.

37:29.289 --> 37:30.779
(grunts)

37:30.874 --> 37:33.206
(walkers growling)

37:35.128 --> 37:36.664
(grunts)

37:40.091 --> 37:43.880
(growling continues)

37:47.932 --> 37:49.764
Negan:
Goddamn psychopath...

37:49.851 --> 37:51.592
You're gonna
kill us both.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.643
Long as it's you first.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.437
- (growling continues)
- Aah!

37:55.523 --> 37:57.264
(growling continues)

38:07.160 --> 38:09.367
(grunts)

38:09.454 --> 38:12.537
(growling continues)

38:18.797 --> 38:20.128
(glass shatters)

38:20.215 --> 38:21.831
(growling continues)

38:21.925 --> 38:23.461
(glass shatters)

38:23.551 --> 38:27.135
(growling continues)

38:49.869 --> 38:53.658
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

38:53.748 --> 38:56.160
(door creaks)

39:03.299 --> 39:05.085
No spoken word?

39:05.176 --> 39:06.883
I'm agreeing to your deal.

39:06.970 --> 39:10.008
We'll fill your four crates,
then you can go.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.885
You're gonna want that
to be sooner than later.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.262
Iaccept

39:14.352 --> 39:16.593
But I'm changing the terms.

39:16.688 --> 39:20.272
This one, no more.

39:20.358 --> 39:21.894
In addition,

39:21.985 --> 39:26.570
you can have a sizeable portion
of my food stores.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.489
From the looks
of things around here,

39:29.576 --> 39:32.284
you need it
far more than we do.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.202
You're giving us food?

39:35.206 --> 39:37.163
In exchange for what?

39:37.250 --> 39:39.617
Records and good faith.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.917
To be clear,

39:41.004 --> 39:42.745
this isn't a gift, it's barter.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.045
I'll be back.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.294
Maybe not for a while,
but I will,

39:46.384 --> 39:51.254
and by then,
I expect great things.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.509
Here...

39:53.600 --> 39:57.514
is the aforementioned
key to a future.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.938
Inside, there are
handwritten plans for windmills,

40:01.024 --> 40:04.608
watermills, silos,
hand-drawn schematics,

40:04.694 --> 40:08.938
guides to refining grain,
creating lumber, aqueducts--

40:09.032 --> 40:12.525
a book
of medieval human achievement

40:12.619 --> 40:15.862
so we may have a future
from our past.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.335
Yes, I know,
the originals are in my head,

40:23.421 --> 40:24.752
but I made photocopies.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.456
Still, it's been
an evolving document

40:27.550 --> 40:28.961
since the copy shop.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.965
Thank you.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.013
Build this place up.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.966
I want those other crates filled
when I get back--

40:38.061 --> 40:40.769
cheeses for Hilda,
pickles for Midge.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.142
We'll see what we can do.

40:43.232 --> 40:46.520
You will.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.361
(van doors open, close)

40:57.455 --> 40:59.366
(engine starts)

41:08.716 --> 41:11.959
(van departing)

41:15.848 --> 41:18.260
(gate creaks, closes)

41:26.317 --> 41:28.479
I killed Natania.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.322
She was out there trying to kill
anyone she came across,

41:33.408 --> 41:35.115
and we came across her.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.156
So I killed her, and I'm alive,

41:39.247 --> 41:42.330
and Carl saved someone,
and he's dead.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.951
How the hell
are we supposed to do this?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.036
Are we supposed to
just stop fighting?

41:48.131 --> 41:51.465
(hammering in distance)

41:55.638 --> 41:59.347
I don't think Carl wanted us
to stop fighting for our future.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.640
But I think he was telling us
that, to get to our future,

42:04.731 --> 42:06.847
it's gonna take
more than just fighting.

42:06.941 --> 42:08.431
The Saviors
are coming right now.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.767
And we're
gonna fight them.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.522
But there's gotta be
something after.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.864
(chatter)

42:27.378 --> 42:29.585
Man:
He's not with them.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.915
(chatter continues)

42:35.178 --> 42:37.465
Where's Negan?

42:39.182 --> 42:41.549
Gone.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.101
You couldn't find him?

42:47.774 --> 42:50.391
Just blood.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.901
Now what, hmm?

42:53.988 --> 42:56.525
What are we
supposed to do now?

42:56.616 --> 42:58.232
Who are you?

42:58.326 --> 43:00.909
Negan.

43:00.995 --> 43:02.611
Who?!

43:02.705 --> 43:04.321
Negan!

43:04.415 --> 43:06.406
I am Negan!

43:06.501 --> 43:08.708
Damn right you are!

43:08.795 --> 43:10.911
We all are!

43:11.005 --> 43:15.795
Don't matter
if the big man ain't here.

43:15.885 --> 43:18.217
We're still Negan.

43:22.809 --> 43:25.141
We don't know
if he's "gone" gone.

43:25.228 --> 43:29.222
He could very well
be back.

43:31.442 --> 43:37.939
Our plan-- Megan's plan--
was to go on to Hilltop

43:38.032 --> 43:41.946
and put the fear of God
in these people

43:42.036 --> 43:44.528
so that, finally,
once and for all,

43:44.622 --> 43:46.738
they get with the program.

43:49.836 --> 43:55.172
But after what just happened,
what they did to Negan,

43:55.258 --> 44:01.254
that tells me that what we need
from them is beyond them.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.888
It's time
we come to accept that.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.565
And once we do,
it'll become crystal clear

44:13.651 --> 44:18.191
there's only one thing left
for us to do.

44:18.281 --> 44:24.573
We must expunge them.

44:24.662 --> 44:28.872
We must redact them!

44:30.418 --> 44:36.755
They are a mistake
that we shall now erase.

44:39.969 --> 44:43.428
We are moving on.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.347
For Negan!

44:50.438 --> 44:52.020
Yes?

44:52.106 --> 44:54.188
For Negan!

45:02.283 --> 45:04.524
(sighs)

45:11.042 --> 45:15.252
(chuckles)

45:15.338 --> 45:17.454
Well, shit.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.084
Shut up.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.461
(theme music playing)
