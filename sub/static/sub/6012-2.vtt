WEBVTT

00:37.940 --> 00:39.900
Wait one moment.

00:46.016 --> 00:49.216
She can decide whether or not she
wants to throw these away.

00:49.336 --> 00:51.296
Quite right.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.715 --> 01:06.676
But how would it be funded?

01:06.698 --> 01:10.337
There's quite a lot in the kitty
and we'd have another campaign.

01:10.338 --> 01:13.457
There'll be plenty of volunteers to
keep up standards.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.778
For how long? And what about the
cricket?

01:15.779 --> 01:19.338
We'd have to re-site the pitch, My
Lord. Of course it would take work

01:19.343 --> 01:22.622
but we've got until the summer.
Think what we're gaining.

01:22.623 --> 01:24.703
A beautiful garden of remembrance.

01:24.704 --> 01:29.068
Where people can walk and sit
and think about their loved ones.

01:29.069 --> 01:30.749
They can come here from all around

01:30.774 --> 01:34.413
and spend an hour with their sacred
memories in peace and at rest.

01:34.414 --> 01:36.653
This pitch has been prepared over
years

01:36.654 --> 01:38.774
with a great deal of work for the
cricket.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.025
That field below Peckham wood could
be made into a pitch.

01:42.026 --> 01:45.865
Surely the right place is in the
village where people pass every day.

01:45.866 --> 01:49.065
Will it be peaceful and quiet?
A fit place for mourning?

01:49.066 --> 01:53.585
It's what they're doing in Sowerby
and I'm certain it's where most of
them will be.

01:53.586 --> 01:56.505
And is our memorial to be no better
than most of them?

01:56.506 --> 01:59.105
It comes down to priorities,
Lord Grantham.

01:59.106 --> 02:03.706
Which is more important, a game of
cricket or the loss of a son in the
course of his duty?

02:12.626 --> 02:15.185
Well, this is it, then.

02:15.186 --> 02:17.146
There's something I wanna say.

02:18.466 --> 02:20.945
I'm sorry I put you through all that
trouble.

02:20.946 --> 02:23.025
Forget it.

02:23.026 --> 02:26.465
It's in t'past. Well, you've been a
good friend to me, Thomas.

02:26.466 --> 02:29.626
If anyone had told me that I'd have
been friends with a...

02:29.627 --> 02:31.746
man like you I'd have not believed
them.

02:34.426 --> 02:36.386
But we have been friends.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.666
And I'm sad to see the back of you.
I am.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.825
We can always write.

02:43.826 --> 02:46.426
I'm not much at letter writing.
I'll do me best.

02:47.306 --> 02:49.345
But in case we don't meet again...

02:49.346 --> 02:51.946
I hope you find some happiness.

02:54.346 --> 02:56.385
I do, truly.

02:56.386 --> 02:58.425
I hope the same for you too, Jimmy.

02:58.426 --> 03:00.386
I'll be dandy.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.026
I'd best be off.

03:27.546 --> 03:29.585
I'm sorry Jimmy's gone.
I know.

03:29.586 --> 03:32.305
It were nice having a bonny face
about the house.

03:32.306 --> 03:34.985
We'll have to make do with Mr
Molesley.

03:34.986 --> 03:37.105
How are you studies going?

03:37.106 --> 03:40.985
Slowly. It's bound to be hard when
you've not been at school for a while.

03:40.986 --> 03:43.025
It's not hard, it's impossible.

03:43.026 --> 03:45.065
But what's the answer?

03:45.066 --> 03:47.026
Is the pudding ready to go up?

03:48.226 --> 03:51.105
Mrs Patmore? The pudding.
Sorry. I was miles away.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.066
There's a sauce to go with that.

03:54.226 --> 03:56.305
On one tray or will Mr Barrow help?

03:56.306 --> 03:59.225
One tray, please. I can't be
bothered to fight with him.

03:59.226 --> 04:01.226
Jimmy, where are you when we need
you?

04:06.986 --> 04:09.305
Ooh, Mr Carson.
What is it now?

04:09.306 --> 04:12.865
Now that Jimmy, erm, James, has
gone,

04:12.866 --> 04:15.265
do I take it that I am now
first footman?

04:15.266 --> 04:20.385
Since you are the only footman, you
are first, second, third and last.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.465
Make what you will of it.

04:22.466 --> 04:25.305
Mr Moseley, we are nearly at the end
of those distinctions.

04:25.306 --> 04:29.066
There will come a time when a
household is lucky to boast any footman.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.026
Now get that up to the dining room.

04:32.626 --> 04:34.705
Did it not go well this morning?

04:34.706 --> 04:36.785
I was disappointed, if you must
know.

04:36.786 --> 04:38.746
But it's early days.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.625
George is coming on so fast.

04:41.626 --> 04:45.025
It's wonderful how they seem to
change week by week at his age.

04:45.026 --> 04:47.265
He's rather sweet, isn't he?

04:47.266 --> 04:49.705
How are you getting on with repairing
the fire damage?

04:49.706 --> 04:53.025
Oh, they're all being marvellous
but I do feel such an idiot.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.345
Maybe because you behaved like an
idiot.

04:55.346 --> 04:58.265
The good thing is it'll be sorted
out in a day or two.

04:58.266 --> 05:01.385
I got this letter from Charles
Blake? What does he want?

05:01.386 --> 05:04.906
An art historian he knows is writing
a book on della Francesca.

05:04.907 --> 05:07.905
He wasn't aware we had one of his
paintings at Downton.

05:07.906 --> 05:09.985
He's desperate to see it.

05:09.986 --> 05:13.345
I assume it's just an excuse so
Charles can pay court to Mary.

05:13.346 --> 05:17.385
He doesn't want to come. He wrote to
introduce his friend Simon Bricker.

05:17.386 --> 05:20.786
I can invite Charles if you'd like.
I don't mind either way.

05:20.787 --> 05:25.105
I will ask him. We don't know Mr Bricker.
It might be easier if Charles was here.

05:25.106 --> 05:29.065
Don't forget I'm away from Tuesday.
I wish I knew where you were going.

05:29.066 --> 05:32.105
I haven't a clue. I expect we'll
drive around for a few days

05:32.106 --> 05:34.625
and stop and sketch when we see a
view we like.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.746
Who's this with?
Annabelle Portsmouth. It'll be fun.

05:37.747 --> 05:41.705
How was your morning, Papa? Have you
decided where to put the memorial?

05:41.706 --> 05:43.705
No.
Carson?

05:43.706 --> 05:45.745
Not yet, my lady.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.706
It's difficult to please everyone.

05:49.426 --> 05:53.705
Bella Davis telephoned to talk about
her work with Russian refugees in York.

05:53.706 --> 05:56.786
Are there many Russian refugees in
York? I'm afraid so.

05:56.787 --> 05:58.905
They're scattered all over Europe.

05:58.906 --> 06:03.385
Trying to establish communities to save
their culture after the ravages of revolution.

06:03.386 --> 06:05.465
Ghastly for them, eh, Tom?

06:05.466 --> 06:08.466
I feel sorry for anyone exiled from
their own country.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.545
I pity those who stayed behind

06:10.546 --> 06:13.465
only to be tortured and murdered in
their thousands.

06:13.466 --> 06:15.505
Leave him alone, Papa.

06:15.506 --> 06:17.585
I was at the hospital today

06:17.586 --> 06:20.466
and Mrs Henderson has done the most
generous thing

06:20.467 --> 06:23.985
and given a wireless to the ward so
that they can listen to music and the news

06:23.986 --> 06:27.905
and sometimes even a play. I can't
tell you how it brightens things up.

06:27.906 --> 06:30.425
I'm told that they're far more
efficient now

06:30.426 --> 06:32.465
and much easier to tune.
No.

06:32.466 --> 06:35.066
But... I haven't asked anything.
No.

06:36.626 --> 06:39.426
Shall we go through and let the
servants get in here?

06:46.946 --> 06:48.985
Hello.

06:48.986 --> 06:50.946
Dawn raid?

06:52.746 --> 06:55.305
Look who it is. Come on, my lady.

06:55.306 --> 06:57.345
Hello, Mrs Drewe.

06:57.346 --> 06:59.306
I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

07:01.146 --> 07:03.185
Hello, darling.

07:03.186 --> 07:05.706
Hello. How are you?

07:06.186 --> 07:08.265
Why don't you sit there, my lady?

07:08.266 --> 07:10.825
Have they started cleaning up after
the fire?

07:10.826 --> 07:13.825
They're doing it now. Thank heaven it
was only my room.

07:13.826 --> 07:15.905
God, I was stupid.

07:15.906 --> 07:18.865
It's wonderful the interest you take
in her, my lady.

07:18.866 --> 07:21.306
Perhaps you'll keep an eye on her as
she grows.

07:24.546 --> 07:26.585
I'm sure I will.

07:26.586 --> 07:28.665
It would be a blessing if you would.

07:28.666 --> 07:31.986
After all, she's almost a foundling.
No parents of her own.

07:31.987 --> 07:34.785
No family, no-one to turn to.
What are you saying?

07:34.786 --> 07:36.865
We're her family now?

07:36.866 --> 07:40.425
I know. But there's a limit to what
we can do with three of our own.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.866
I don't understand you. Marigold is
one of our own.

07:43.867 --> 07:48.665
Or very nearly. All I'm saying is her
ladyship could prove to be a real blessing

07:48.666 --> 07:50.745
if she'd only take an interest.

07:50.746 --> 07:52.746
She seems a bright little thing to
me.

07:59.906 --> 08:02.786
Well, I'd have to think about it.
Course you will.

08:02.787 --> 08:06.786
Because if people get used to seeing
you together, you can't just duck out.

08:08.346 --> 08:11.945
That's why we must think carefully
and only take it on if I'm sure.

08:11.946 --> 08:14.545
You could be a sort of godmother.

08:14.546 --> 08:16.625
That's it.

08:16.626 --> 08:20.145
Yes, I could be Marigold's godmother.
She's got a godmother.

08:20.146 --> 08:22.305
We had her christened and my
sister's -

08:22.306 --> 08:24.986
Talk it over with his lordship,
why don't you?

08:24.987 --> 08:29.625
See what he thinks. Maybe I could
take her up to the house to visit my
niece and nephew.

08:29.626 --> 08:32.905
My eye. How lucky would she be?

08:32.905 --> 08:35.304
It is all very good of you, my lady,
I'm sure.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.265
Give it a thought. Then we'll see.

08:43.785 --> 08:49.345
Sorry. Dr Clarkson has just been
telling me about the latest report
of the drug insulin.

08:49.346 --> 08:52.465
Oh. It's going to make a great
difference to many lives.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.025
I'm quite sure of that.
I agree.

08:55.026 --> 08:58.985
We're a backwater here but, heaven
knows, we've our share of diabetes.

08:58.986 --> 09:01.506
A diagnosis will no longer be a
death sentence.

09:02.266 --> 09:05.865
I'm glad to see your old interests
are reasserting themselves.

09:05.866 --> 09:09.185
Why do you say that? Mrs Crawley's
been distracted lately.

09:09.186 --> 09:13.465
With Lord Merton frisking around her
skirts and getting in the way.

09:13.466 --> 09:15.545
You make too much of it.

09:15.546 --> 09:20.185
Do I? We've been invited to tea with
Lord Merton at Cavenham.

09:20.186 --> 09:22.306
I opened the letter this morning.

09:22.307 --> 09:26.705
Maybe you're the real quarry and he's only
hunting me to throw you off the scent.

09:26.706 --> 09:30.465
I may be older than I was but I can
still tell when a man is interested.

09:30.466 --> 09:33.425
I believe Cavenham Park has some
beautiful gardens.

09:33.426 --> 09:35.986
Though it's the wrong time of year
to see them.

09:35.987 --> 09:39.905
The promise of the gardens in summer
will be the final worm on the hook.

09:39.906 --> 09:42.825
Honestly, I'm as good at being
teased as the next man

09:42.826 --> 09:45.066
but even my sense of humour has its
limits.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.786
Off you go, Miss Goody Two Shoes.

09:51.787 --> 09:55.745
You can play the holy mother all you
like, you still nearly got me sacked.

09:55.746 --> 09:57.825
Leave her alone.

09:57.826 --> 10:01.346
Oh, gallant Mr Molesley. She's never
told you though, has she?

10:01.347 --> 10:04.305
Miss Baxter has had troubles in the
past

10:04.306 --> 10:08.225
which you tried to use against her.
Until her ladyship put a stop to it.

10:08.226 --> 10:11.066
That is all I need to know.
I knew she hadn't told you.

10:11.746 --> 10:15.145
Barrow. Could you please tell Mrs
Patmore I'm here?

10:15.146 --> 10:17.185
Very good, my lady.

10:17.186 --> 10:19.146
Mrs Patmore, Lady Rose.

10:22.146 --> 10:24.185
A delicious dinner, Mrs Patmore.

10:24.186 --> 10:26.225
Thank you very much.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.345
You wanted a word?

10:28.346 --> 10:33.265
Only if it's convenient, my lady.
But, you know that young woman who
works at the school?

10:33.266 --> 10:38.385
Miss Bunting. Mr Branson's friend.
Yes. I didn't like to ask him in
case he found it awkward.

10:38.386 --> 10:42.826
I was wondering if she might be
prepared to take on some extra work.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.705
But suppose they telephone Lady
Portsmouth.

10:46.706 --> 10:48.786
She's promised she'll cover for me.

10:48.787 --> 10:51.345
I feel quite nervous. And I'm not
even going.

10:51.346 --> 10:55.425
We'll choose the clothes carefully
so you can take them on and off
without my help.

10:55.426 --> 10:57.505
Well, I'll have his help.

10:57.506 --> 11:01.025
Honestly, my lady. You'd better hope
I never write my memoirs.

11:01.026 --> 11:03.145
There is one thing I've got to ask
you.

11:03.146 --> 11:06.026
I'm really sorry, but I must.
Go on.

11:07.106 --> 11:10.825
I have to sure there aren't
any... consequences.

11:10.826 --> 11:12.865
What sort of consequences?

11:12.866 --> 11:14.905
Well, you know.

11:14.906 --> 11:16.945
No, I don't.

11:16.946 --> 11:20.145
Oh, my God. Er...

11:20.146 --> 11:22.226
I mean, I beg your pardon, my lady.

11:22.227 --> 11:25.305
But you see I can't just go into a
shop and buy something.

11:25.306 --> 11:27.266
What if I were recognised?

11:27.826 --> 11:29.865
But I wouldn't know what to buy.

11:29.866 --> 11:31.826
I've thought of that.

11:33.466 --> 11:36.305
I have a copy of Marie Stopes's
book.

11:36.306 --> 11:38.345
It tells you everything.

11:38.346 --> 11:41.265
Well, won't he take care of it?

11:41.266 --> 11:44.706
I don't think one should rely on a
man in that department, do you?

11:45.826 --> 11:48.425
But suppose I'm recognised?
But you won't be?

11:48.426 --> 11:50.465
And even if you are, you're married.

11:50.466 --> 11:52.545
With a living husband.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.506
Why shouldn't you buy one?

11:59.186 --> 12:02.625
Is it true that Lady Rose wants his
lordship to buy a wireless?

12:02.626 --> 12:04.905
Whether he will or not's another
matter.

12:04.906 --> 12:06.985
I like the idea of a wireless.

12:06.986 --> 12:09.905
To hear people singing and talking in
London and all sorts.

12:09.906 --> 12:12.985
What's so good about that when you
can go to a music hall in York?

12:12.986 --> 12:15.065
I'd rather hear a live singer.

12:15.066 --> 12:18.305
If you're looking for Miss Baxter,
she's still upstairs.

12:18.306 --> 12:21.106
Why do you have to make everything
sound so nasty?

12:21.107 --> 12:25.385
I'm nasty about Miss Baxter because
she came here to help me and she's
broken her word.

12:25.386 --> 12:27.346
I doubt that's how she'd put it.

12:28.586 --> 12:31.905
Do you think with her past she'd
come near a house like this?

12:31.906 --> 12:34.465
She'd be lucky to get work in a
public laundry.

12:34.466 --> 12:37.786
I'm sure she's grateful. Then she's
a funny way of showing it.

12:38.946 --> 12:40.906
You do know she's a thief.

12:44.626 --> 12:46.665
Stole her mistresses jewels.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.745
There must be more to it than that.

12:48.746 --> 12:51.985
No. She sneaked up to the bedroom,
snatched up the pieces,

12:51.986 --> 12:55.505
pearl necklaces, diamond bracelets,
put them in her pockets.

12:55.506 --> 12:58.346
Then tried to make it look as if
someone had broken in.

12:59.666 --> 13:04.425
She was obviously unsuccessful.
They gave her five years but she
only served three.

13:04.426 --> 13:08.825
Came out a few months before I
brought her up here so don't say she
doesn't owe me.

13:08.826 --> 13:10.945
Has Mrs Bates come down yet?
Not yet.

13:10.946 --> 13:14.665
We were just discussing your friend.
Miss Baxter.

13:14.666 --> 13:16.705
Is she my friend particularly?

13:16.706 --> 13:18.825
She seems to think so.

13:18.826 --> 13:24.025
I know you mean to lead me into
further inquiry but I couldn't care
less what you think, Thomas.

13:24.026 --> 13:26.145
On that subject or any other.
I agree.

13:26.146 --> 13:28.225
No, you don't.

13:28.226 --> 13:31.386
Cos you listened to the story,
didn't you?

13:37.986 --> 13:39.946
What was that about?

13:41.026 --> 13:42.986
Oh, nothing.

13:49.363 --> 13:52.883
I must remember to organise a car to
meet Charles Blake and his friend.

13:52.887 --> 13:57.187
They'll be here at teatime. Are we a
hotel that never presents a bill?

13:57.284 --> 13:59.363
You've already made that joke.

13:59.364 --> 14:04.282
There you are. I need your advice.
How flattering. What is it?

14:04.283 --> 14:07.682
Should I go?
No. No, it's not a secret.

14:07.683 --> 14:12.403
I've been talking to Mr Drewe. Did
you know they've taken in a child?

14:12.404 --> 14:15.444
The daughter of a friend who died.
How kind of them.

14:15.445 --> 14:22.162
The girl is very endearing and I
think I'd like to be involved in her
future. To help her in some way.

14:22.163 --> 14:24.323
Maybe with school fees or something.

14:24.324 --> 14:27.202
I've money from my articles and
Grandpapa's trust.

14:27.203 --> 14:29.402
Has Drewe put you up to this?

14:29.403 --> 14:33.043
No. But I'd like to take an active
interest.

14:33.923 --> 14:36.002
It'd be good for me.

14:36.003 --> 14:38.882
It's your money. Do what you like
with it.

14:38.883 --> 14:41.882
But you can't just give the child up
when you get bored.

14:41.883 --> 14:44.002
I won't get bored.

14:44.003 --> 14:49.483
Cousin Robert, did you see this
article about how wirelesses are
getting cheaper and more reliable?

14:50.563 --> 14:52.603
No. I just thought it was
interesting.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.684
No.

14:57.683 --> 15:00.802
What's Mr Branson's pal doing down
here?

15:00.803 --> 15:02.882
Why? Don't you approve?

15:02.883 --> 15:05.522
Last time she came, she gave them
all an earful.

15:05.523 --> 15:09.362
I cannot solve the mystery. How are
you getting on with the memorial?

15:09.363 --> 15:12.883
His Lordship is resisting the idea
of the garden.

15:14.243 --> 15:18.122
You don't agree with him?
Well, as it happens, I do.

15:18.123 --> 15:22.202
What? I don't believe in your garden
of remembrance.

15:22.203 --> 15:24.282
In a town, maybe.

15:24.283 --> 15:28.083
But the Yorkshire scenery is our
garden of remembrance.

15:28.084 --> 15:34.162
I'd prefer to see a memorial at the
heart of village life so we'd pass
it on the way to church or the shop

15:34.163 --> 15:37.922
and give a thought to the boys who
fell. You surprise me, Mrs Hughes.

15:37.923 --> 15:42.402
I was disappointed in his Lordship,
but I'm more disappointed in you.

15:42.403 --> 15:45.683
Every relationship has its ups and
downs.

15:51.603 --> 15:53.642
Yes, miss.

15:53.643 --> 15:55.603
Erm...

15:57.443 --> 15:59.963
Is there a lady I could deal with?

16:01.523 --> 16:04.483
Very good, madam. If you'll just
wait there.

16:11.163 --> 16:14.883
I've not quite made up my mind.
Why not serve the gentleman first?

16:14.884 --> 16:18.083
That's kind of you. Packet of safety
razor blades, please.

16:20.843 --> 16:23.763
That's sixpence, sir.
Thank you.

16:27.003 --> 16:30.202
If we keep this up we'll have another
customer along soon.

16:30.203 --> 16:32.763
Yes. Erm...

16:34.763 --> 16:36.723
I would like to buy...

16:37.843 --> 16:39.803
..one of these.

16:40.963 --> 16:43.042
I can see you're married.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.322
I am married, yes. But you don't
with for any more children.

16:46.323 --> 16:48.362
That's it. That's right.

16:48.363 --> 16:50.323
There is always abstinence.

16:51.723 --> 16:53.802
Of course there is but...

16:53.803 --> 16:56.642
I don't want to take any risks
because of my health.

16:56.643 --> 17:01.523
Oh, I see. Well, that does put a
slightly different colour on it.

17:03.003 --> 17:04.963
Three and eleven.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.002
Keep the change.
What about the instructions?

17:12.002 --> 17:15.963
They can be very difficult to manage.
I'm sure it's perfect. Thank you.

17:19.323 --> 17:22.842
I'll take half a crown a lesson.
That's five shillings a week.

17:22.843 --> 17:26.041
You can use my sitting room if you
need somewhere private.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.122
See you after school. Goodbye.

17:28.123 --> 17:31.202
Wait a minute! That is Daisy's
busiest time.

17:31.203 --> 17:34.762
I can't come any earlier. Oh, well,
then. Perhaps - I'm excited.

17:34.763 --> 17:38.482
But I'll pay. It's not right that you
should waste your money on me.

17:38.483 --> 17:41.402
No, I want to pay.
That's a nice thing you're doing.

17:41.403 --> 17:45.602
Is it? Well, I think I've been a
damn fool and doubled me workload!

17:45.603 --> 17:48.242
I wondered who was in here.

17:48.243 --> 17:51.362
We're just sorting out some things
for Rose's refugees.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.442
Poor Rose.

17:53.443 --> 17:55.843
Why are you so against getting a
wireless?

17:55.844 --> 18:00.122
I wish she'd just say it. "Cousin
Robert, please buy a wireless for Downton."

18:00.123 --> 18:03.042
I wouldn't mind.
That's because you're American.

18:03.043 --> 18:05.523
I find the whole idea a kind of
thief of life.

18:05.524 --> 18:11.202
People waste hours huddled around a
box listening to someone burbling
inanities from somewhere else.

18:11.203 --> 18:13.282
But surely now with the latest news

18:13.283 --> 18:16.442
and it must be a boon for the old.
What do you think, Bates?

18:16.443 --> 18:19.122
I can't see the Dowager with a
wireless, my lady.

18:19.123 --> 18:21.162
It's a fad. It won't last.

18:21.163 --> 18:23.123
Oh, no. Not that one.

18:33.683 --> 18:35.762
This is nice.

18:35.763 --> 18:38.962
Lord Grantham said it was the
coldest house in Yorkshire.

18:38.963 --> 18:41.042
Ah, you're here. I'm so pleased.

18:41.043 --> 18:43.083
How charming it is.
Oh, we do our best.

18:44.203 --> 18:47.962
I know it's the wrong time of year
but I would love to see the gardens.

18:47.963 --> 18:51.802
Shouldn't we allow Lord Merton to
tell us how he's planned our visit?

18:51.803 --> 18:53.802
Of course.
It is his house.

18:53.803 --> 18:55.763
Yes. I know that.

19:02.363 --> 19:04.442
You've been very quiet all day.

19:04.443 --> 19:07.003
Have I?
I wish you'd tell me what it is.

19:09.283 --> 19:11.243
Very well.

19:14.883 --> 19:18.922
Last night Mr Barrow chose to give
me an account of your history.

19:18.923 --> 19:21.002
He was bound to, sooner or later.

19:21.003 --> 19:24.122
His version is a bleak one, which
will not surprise you.

19:24.123 --> 19:27.522
What did he say? Well, for a start,
he seemed to suggest

19:27.523 --> 19:32.042
that you were in some sort
of... privileged position.

19:32.043 --> 19:34.722
I was a trusted senior ladies maid
to a good woman

19:34.723 --> 19:37.602
in a rich and respectable household.

19:37.603 --> 19:43.042
But then he said that... you just
took your employer's jewels.

19:43.043 --> 19:46.763
Snatched them up and put them into
your pocket.

19:47.563 --> 19:49.922
I stole a pearl necklace with a ruby
clasp.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.082
Two diamond bracelets and four
rings.

19:52.083 --> 19:55.363
Did he tell you I tried to pretend
it was a burglary?

19:57.523 --> 20:00.802
Well, then. I think you have all the
relevant information.

20:00.803 --> 20:02.882
There must be something more.

20:02.883 --> 20:07.042
There must have been a cause, a
reason for you to do such a thing.

20:07.043 --> 20:12.482
What sort of cause? I don't know.
Someone that you cared for

20:12.483 --> 20:16.802
needed money for an emergency and
you were desperate to help.

20:16.803 --> 20:21.762
I was a common thief, Mr Molesley.
A convicted criminal. A jailbird.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.403
I don't believe you.
Because you don't want to.

20:25.363 --> 20:28.843
I would only say that I am not that
person now.

20:39.243 --> 20:43.042
When you've finished your tea, we
can walk the terraces, if you like.

20:43.043 --> 20:45.122
That sounds ideal.

20:45.123 --> 20:47.962
I recently read a book on the
science of quarantine

20:47.963 --> 20:51.082
and I've been looking forward to
discussing it with you.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.202
We mustn't bore Lady Grantham.

20:53.203 --> 20:57.122
Oh, you're right. You see, I need
your guiding hand to keep me in check.

20:57.123 --> 21:01.962
Mrs Crawley is never happier than when
she has a chance to use her guiding hand.

21:01.963 --> 21:03.923
Are you, dear?

21:05.323 --> 21:07.362
How pretty this room is.
Thank you.

21:07.363 --> 21:11.682
Mama re-did all these rooms in the
'80s. She had good taste, I think.

21:11.683 --> 21:14.042
Is one allowed to brag about one's
mother?

21:14.043 --> 21:16.882
So the late Lady Merton didn't
change it?

21:16.883 --> 21:18.762
Ada didn't use it much.

21:18.763 --> 21:21.882
She thought it was draughty being so
near the front door.

21:21.883 --> 21:23.843
I suppose she had a point.

21:24.723 --> 21:27.602
If you don't like being quite so
near the front door.

21:27.603 --> 21:30.202
Well, I think it's enchanting.

21:30.203 --> 21:32.242
It's a woman's room, though.

21:32.243 --> 21:34.322
Of course.

21:34.323 --> 21:36.882
The library and the dining room are
masculine

21:36.883 --> 21:40.802
the drawing rooms and the music rooms
are feminine. Or so I was taught.

21:40.803 --> 21:44.682
I meant that it needs a woman's
presence to make sense of it.

21:44.683 --> 21:48.283
When I'm on my own in here I feel
like a bull in a china shop.

21:52.203 --> 21:54.322
Why aren't you going with her?
What?

21:54.323 --> 21:57.083
With Lady Mary? She'll be away for
almost a week.

21:57.084 --> 22:01.482
Yes but they're driving round. They
don't know where they'll stay or anything.

22:01.483 --> 22:05.002
She and Lady Portsmouth? Yes.
It doesn't sound like Lady Mary.

22:05.003 --> 22:07.082
It sounds a bit bohemian.

22:07.083 --> 22:10.522
I suppose she's allowed to get away
from it all if she wants to.

22:10.523 --> 22:13.003
Like anyone.
Yes. I suppose she is.

22:14.723 --> 22:18.522
What do you make of Edith's burst of
generosity with the Drewe girl?

22:18.523 --> 22:24.202
In all probability her beloved
Gregson is dead and she has to sit
and watch her sisters' children play.

22:24.203 --> 22:26.962
She wants someone to love. It's as
simple as that.

22:26.963 --> 22:30.722
The problem will come when she has a
child of her own to distract her.

22:30.723 --> 22:33.082
Let's cross that bridge when we come
to it.

22:33.083 --> 22:36.483
And let's hope the Drewes don't get
sick of her in the meantime.

22:39.603 --> 22:42.163
Was it ghastly?
I didn't know where to look.

22:42.164 --> 22:46.522
But when I thought about it
afterwards it seemed unfair to
punish me like that.

22:46.523 --> 22:51.042
Suppose I had eight children and
didn't want any more? Wouldn't I
have the right?

22:51.043 --> 22:55.002
I agree completely. I feel like
going back and ordering a baker's dozen.

22:55.003 --> 22:56.963
One's enough for now.

22:58.123 --> 23:00.723
Mr Bricker.
This is wonderfully kind of you.

23:00.724 --> 23:05.802
You can see the painting now or
after dinner or wait until tomorrow.
It's entirely up to you.

23:05.803 --> 23:08.642
I think I'd like a glimpse of it
later this evening.

23:08.643 --> 23:12.002
I can take a proper look in the
daylight with my wits about me.

23:12.003 --> 23:15.442
You look as if you've spent the
winter away from these shores.

23:15.443 --> 23:18.362
I've been in Alexandria.
Really? I don't envy you.

23:18.363 --> 23:21.243
I'm not very good at abroad.
she's in the kitchen?

23:21.244 --> 23:25.922
I don't know what room she's in. She was giving
a lesson to Daisy and she's still here.

23:25.923 --> 23:29.082
Shouldn't we invite her to dinner?
As she's your friend.

23:29.083 --> 23:32.602
I don't think Lord Grantham would
like it. Not after last time.

23:32.603 --> 23:36.123
But it seems terribly grand and
unfriendly not to. I'll ask Cora.

23:39.123 --> 23:42.122
How are you? I haven't seen you for
ages.

23:42.123 --> 23:45.282
Have I neglected you? I'm sorry.

23:45.283 --> 23:50.562
No need to apologise. Although I
think you might perhaps have told me
I was not the lucky winner.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.802
Why would you say that?
Because it's perfectly obvious.

23:53.803 --> 23:56.282
Well, I don't seem to have broken
your heart.

23:56.283 --> 23:58.243
You sound disappointed.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.042
Who is this fellow, anyway.

24:02.043 --> 24:04.122
Simon Bricker? Just a chap I know.

24:04.123 --> 24:06.523
He was talking about his book in
Boodle's.

24:06.524 --> 24:10.603
I mentioned the painting here and
that was it. He's very brown. Lucky chap.

24:12.003 --> 24:15.202
Charles, I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

24:15.203 --> 24:20.362
It's just only lately that I've
started to come out of the mist.

24:20.363 --> 24:24.722
And the mist is clearing around the
lithe and supple figure of Tony Gillingham.

24:24.723 --> 24:29.042
Maybe. Well... Good luck to you both.

24:29.043 --> 24:31.122
I mean it.

24:31.123 --> 24:34.763
That's why I came here. So I could
wish you luck in person.

24:38.083 --> 24:40.923
We should give her the option.
If you're certain.

24:40.924 --> 24:44.762
I don't want to feel I'm imposing.
Don't be silly. This is your home.

24:44.763 --> 24:47.522
Where's Tom going?
Miss Bunting is downstairs.

24:47.523 --> 24:50.762
What? She's been teaching one of the
maids in the kitchen.

24:50.763 --> 24:54.363
Tom's gone to ask if she'd like some
dinner. You're not serious.

24:54.364 --> 24:59.242
She's the first friend Tom's made
that has nothing to do with us and
we must respect that.

24:59.243 --> 25:03.122
So every time we entertain we must
invite this tinpot Rosa Luxemburg.

25:03.123 --> 25:05.202
Who's she?

25:05.203 --> 25:08.322
A German communist who was shot and
thrown in the canal.

25:08.323 --> 25:10.363
We wouldn't wish that on Miss
Bunting.

25:11.683 --> 25:15.442
I didn't see the time. I've left
Mrs Patmore cooking for everyone.

25:15.443 --> 25:18.563
Tell her from me, you'll prove a
talented mathematician.

25:20.723 --> 25:23.922
Whose idea was it to ask me? Yours?

25:23.923 --> 25:29.122
No, it was Rose. Although it's a new
sensation for me not to be alone in
my opinions at the table.

25:29.123 --> 25:32.203
If I've encouraged you to stand your
ground, I'm glad.

25:32.204 --> 25:37.482
But I don't feel like putting either
myself or Lord Grantham through
another test of strength.

25:37.483 --> 25:39.803
Please thank them and say good night
for me.

25:42.963 --> 25:45.563
I don't need a car. I'm perfectly
happy to walk.

25:45.564 --> 25:47.642
When in Rome.

25:47.643 --> 25:50.802
But do you ever think you might have
been in Rome too long?

25:50.803 --> 25:54.682
Why do you say that? You needn't
always do what the Romans do.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.883
There's more in you than that.
I wonder.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.723
You could do anything you want if
you put your mind to it.

26:04.403 --> 26:08.562
I can't deny it. It's good to hear
you talk as if I had a real future.

26:08.563 --> 26:10.602
You do have a future. But not here.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.722
Not with these people.

26:12.723 --> 26:17.522
Your link to them is Cybil but from
the way you talk I think she was
unique in this family.

26:17.523 --> 26:21.282
Free of prejudice, free from narrow
thinking. That's true enough.

26:21.283 --> 26:25.162
She was unique. I just want you to
remember that you are the man

26:25.163 --> 26:28.282
who tempted her over the park wall
to run away to freedom.

26:28.283 --> 26:30.362
I was that man.

26:30.363 --> 26:32.482
But I'm not sure I can be that man
again.

26:32.483 --> 26:35.202
You can be. I know it.

26:35.203 --> 26:37.163
Good night.

26:47.723 --> 26:49.762
Where's your friend?

26:49.763 --> 26:51.922
She couldn't stay. She had to get
home.

26:51.923 --> 26:53.883
What a relief.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.795
What were you doing in Alexandria?

26:58.877 --> 27:01.797
Escaping the winter and looking at
beautiful things.

27:02.638 --> 27:04.716
Beautiful and very ancient things.

27:04.717 --> 27:08.556
I don't agree. You're collecting
clothes for the Russian refugees.

27:08.557 --> 27:11.917
I said no at first because, well, it
didn't feel terribly me.

27:11.918 --> 27:15.637
But then I thought about them
leading their lives before the fall.

27:15.638 --> 27:17.996
Doing everything you would do.
Exactly.

27:17.997 --> 27:21.636
Dancing and shopping and seeing
their friends and then suddenly

27:21.637 --> 27:24.636
being thrown out to fend for
themselves in the jungle.

27:24.637 --> 27:26.796
Well, I thought I had to help if I
could.

27:26.797 --> 27:30.636
It's lucky Miss Bunting refused our
invitation or she'd give tell us

27:30.637 --> 27:33.196
how they're aristocrats and they
deserve it.

27:33.197 --> 27:35.476
She believes the old regime was
unjust.

27:35.477 --> 27:41.197
She hopes the new system will be an
improvement. Does that make her a
firebrand? Because I agree with her.

27:41.198 --> 27:44.637
Don't acts of savagery forfeit
sympathy for the perpetrators?

27:44.877 --> 27:48.957
It was terrible, of course. But the
English killed King Charles the first

27:48.958 --> 27:52.076
to create a balance between the
throne and parliament.

27:52.077 --> 27:55.796
I didn't kill him personally. I
didn't shoot the Imperial Family.

27:55.797 --> 28:00.156
Goodness. Is this what they call a
lively exchange of views?

28:00.157 --> 28:02.797
It's about now that Papa usually
fetches his gun.

28:03.637 --> 28:06.876
Mary, don't tease Mr Bricker.
He's come to see a painting

28:06.877 --> 28:09.396
and finds himself in the middle of a
civil war.

28:09.397 --> 28:11.516
I don't think we'll split tonight.

28:11.517 --> 28:15.356
They'll only fight if we do. You want to
see the picture and delay is torment.

28:15.357 --> 28:17.317
You read my mind.

28:19.877 --> 28:22.837
Carson, how are we to move forward
with the memorial?

28:22.838 --> 28:25.196
I suppose your position has not
changed.

28:25.197 --> 28:29.437
I can see that I'm losing. I would
rather be convinced than defeated, my lord.

28:29.438 --> 28:31.476
And I am not yet convinced.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.556
Cousin Robert?

28:33.557 --> 28:36.596
Did you see that the King is going
to speak on the wireless?

28:36.597 --> 28:38.796
It was in the paper today.
Don't be silly.

28:38.797 --> 28:42.436
No, it's true. For the opening of
the British Empire Exhibition.

28:42.437 --> 28:46.276
It's being broadcast on the 23rd.
I just thought you'd like to know.

28:46.277 --> 28:48.796
Is this true, Carson?
I believe so, my lord.

28:48.797 --> 28:51.156
Talking about the Empire too.
I wonder.

28:51.157 --> 28:55.637
If the King wants to use the wireless to speak
to his people maybe we have to listen.

28:55.638 --> 28:57.756
I wouldn't say that, my lord.

28:57.757 --> 29:03.237
Is it not a case of the King being
forced into accepting a humiliating
assignment by his ministers?

29:03.238 --> 29:06.876
Are you saying the King is a weak
man, Carson? Never that, my lord.

29:06.877 --> 29:09.516
But even kings must bow to pressure
sometimes.

29:09.517 --> 29:13.076
And should we not support him in his
hour of endurance?

29:13.077 --> 29:15.836
Oh, cheer up. We can always hire one.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.237
Surely we won't be corrupted if it's
only in the house for a day.

29:28.557 --> 29:30.517
They said you were out here.

29:31.717 --> 29:34.517
I thought I'd get some air before we
have our dinner.

29:35.677 --> 29:37.716
I've let you down, haven't I?

29:37.717 --> 29:40.277
No, I wouldn't say so.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.076
You are who you are.

29:44.077 --> 29:46.756
You made choices and you paid the
price for them.

29:46.757 --> 29:50.516
Still, I'm not who you thought me.

29:50.517 --> 29:53.316
It is not for me to pass sentence.

29:53.317 --> 29:55.716
You've had enough of that.

29:55.717 --> 29:57.796
I've changed.

29:57.797 --> 30:01.636
I'm different now. I wish you could
believe me.

30:01.637 --> 30:03.716
But you won't tell me why you did it

30:03.717 --> 30:08.396
because I am not persuaded you could
have acted on your own.

30:08.397 --> 30:13.476
Maybe not. But I don't want to talk
about that.

30:13.477 --> 30:18.437
Because, alone or not, in the end,
I made the choice to steal.

30:20.037 --> 30:22.756
And there's no point trying to pass
the sin along.

30:22.757 --> 30:24.836
Then you won't allow me an opinion.

30:24.837 --> 30:28.236
You see, you wouldn't have done it.
No matter who asked you to.

30:28.237 --> 30:30.197
No matter what the provocation.

30:31.717 --> 30:35.836
I don't claim that. If a man must
watch his loved ones starve,

30:35.837 --> 30:37.876
who's to say what he'll do?

30:37.877 --> 30:39.916
But I wasn't starving, was I?

30:39.917 --> 30:41.877
Believe me.

30:45.917 --> 30:49.917
I'd give a limb to rewrite that
whole chapter of my life.

30:51.637 --> 30:53.597
But I can't, Mr Molesley.

30:54.917 --> 30:56.877
Even for you.

30:59.237 --> 31:01.197
I can't.

31:10.397 --> 31:13.116
Do you have a clear record of how it
came to be here?

31:13.117 --> 31:15.196
The second Earl was our collector.

31:15.197 --> 31:18.716
He bought it when he was quite a
young man on his grand tour.

31:18.717 --> 31:22.596
Which was when? 1789. We've a letter
from his mother.

31:22.597 --> 31:26.957
She's heard about the fall of the
Bastille and her son was going
through France.

31:26.958 --> 31:28.996
She sent it by special messenger.

31:28.997 --> 31:32.036
Mothers. Some things never change.

31:32.037 --> 31:33.997
Lots of things never change.

31:38.477 --> 31:42.677
Tomorrow I can show you some other
pictures he brought back if you have time.

31:42.678 --> 31:46.036
I have all the time in the world.
I should enjoy it very much.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.716
There's coffee in the drawing room.
Thank you.

31:48.717 --> 31:50.756
We'll be right in.

31:50.757 --> 31:52.717
Isis, come here, girl.

31:55.397 --> 31:58.556
I can't believe it. When she
explained how it all worked,

31:58.557 --> 32:02.396
I could see it at once. Well, this
is our lady of the numbers.

32:02.397 --> 32:06.277
If I'd had a teacher like her,
things might have turned out different.

32:06.278 --> 32:08.716
They've not turned out so badly,
have they?

32:08.717 --> 32:11.476
I'm glad to see some smiles at the
end of a long day.

32:11.477 --> 32:14.996
Daisy's singing the praises of Miss
Bunting and her teaching.

32:14.997 --> 32:18.756
I should keep it to yourself. She's
not a favourite with Mr Carson.

32:18.757 --> 32:23.477
Why, what's she done? It's not what
she's done it's what he calls her
dangerous ideas.

32:23.478 --> 32:26.036
Dangerous or not I'm sure they're
good ideas.

32:26.037 --> 32:28.596
Careful, he'll think you've been
infected.

32:28.597 --> 32:33.957
What's this? Daisy's worried she's
been infected with a cold from the
delivery boy.

32:38.397 --> 32:43.197
Oh, his lordship and I are walking
down to the village tomorrow to look
at possible sites.

32:44.477 --> 32:48.757
Erm, I don't like it when we're not
on the same side.

32:49.917 --> 32:53.236
We're different people, Mr Carson.
We can't always agree.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.276
I know.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.237
But I don't like it.

33:01.877 --> 33:05.556
I can't make a decision, Baxter,
until you tell me the whole truth.

33:05.557 --> 33:07.636
I have, my lady.

33:07.637 --> 33:11.037
I don't mean you tried to shield
yourself, quite the contrary.

33:12.877 --> 33:16.516
To be honest, I don't know why I
haven't dismissed you out of hand.

33:16.517 --> 33:20.356
I employ a jewel thief to look after
my jewels. It doesn't make sense!

33:20.357 --> 33:23.876
I don't know what to say. I should
sack you for just concealing it.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.476
Should I take this as my dismissal?

33:26.477 --> 33:30.357
I don't know. I don't know why not
but I don't know.

33:35.077 --> 33:37.196
What was the matter with Tom?

33:37.197 --> 33:42.117
Papa will blame his friend Miss
Bunting for filling his ears with
poison but I'm not sure.

33:42.118 --> 33:45.876
He has so little life away from us.
He's had no life since Cybil died.

33:45.877 --> 33:49.716
But I've a feeling he's turning back
into who he really is.

33:49.717 --> 33:52.437
Is that a bad thing?
For us, maybe. But not for him.

33:53.597 --> 33:56.357
Well, I'm going up.
Good night, you two.

33:57.797 --> 34:01.316
Do you think there's a chance
cousin Robert might get a wireless?

34:01.317 --> 34:04.716
Well, if he won't get one for the
King, your cause is hopeless.

34:04.717 --> 34:06.677
That's true.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.716
I loved Rose's definition of
ordinary life.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.317
Dancing and shopping and seeing one's
friends.

34:15.956 --> 34:17.996
I'm going to bed too.

34:17.996 --> 34:19.956
I'm worn out.

34:20.757 --> 34:24.317
But I hope you'll be happy for me.
If it is Tony in the end.

34:30.397 --> 34:33.315
Nothing will make me happier than
seeing you happy.

34:33.317 --> 34:36.636
But please be absolutely sure before
you decide.

34:36.637 --> 34:39.795
Why do you say that?
Because you're cleverer than he is.

34:39.797 --> 34:42.156
That might have worked in the last
century

34:42.157 --> 34:46.116
when ladies had to hide their brains
behind good manners and breeding.

34:46.117 --> 34:49.676
But not now. I don't agree. I think
Tony is quite as clever as I am.

34:49.677 --> 34:52.156
Then one of us is right...
and one is wrong.

34:52.157 --> 34:58.356
I'm not some overheated housemaid drooling
over a photograph of Douglas Fairbanks.

34:58.357 --> 35:02.076
Plantagenets are as susceptible as
housemaids when it comes to sex.

35:02.077 --> 35:04.876
Are we talking about sex or love?

35:04.877 --> 35:08.597
That is a question mankind has
wrestled with since the dawn of time.

35:08.598 --> 35:10.557
Good night.

35:14.997 --> 35:18.116
Poor Tom. He's nothing more than a
ventriloquist dummy

35:18.117 --> 35:21.756
for that terrible woman's ideas to
come spewing out of his mouth.

35:21.757 --> 35:25.276
Maybe she's given him confidence to
say what he really thinks.

35:25.277 --> 35:29.316
Not to sit in silence listening to a
thousands things he disagrees with.

35:29.317 --> 35:33.157
She'll steal him away from us. She's
pulling him back to the other side.

35:33.357 --> 35:36.716
I hope not. But if he feels he has
to go, that's what he must do.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.356
Well, he's not taking Sybbie.
Don't be silly.

35:39.357 --> 35:43.036
I mean it. I am not having Cybil's
only child

35:43.037 --> 35:45.116
snatched from everyone she loves

35:45.117 --> 35:47.796
to be brought up by some harpie in
an American sewer!

35:47.797 --> 35:51.036
If the time comes, then we will talk
to Tom.

35:51.037 --> 35:53.956
And I suggest we try to be a little
more calm about it.

35:53.957 --> 35:57.476
For heaven's sake! Can't I be angry
when our eldest grandchild

35:57.477 --> 36:00.037
is about to be stolen from us for
ever?

36:02.077 --> 36:05.276
And tell your friend Bricker to stop
flirting with Isis.

36:05.277 --> 36:10.357
There is nothing more ill-bred than
trying to steal the affections of
someone's else's dog!

36:10.358 --> 36:12.396
Very well. I'll tell him.

36:12.397 --> 36:14.357
To stop flirting.

36:16.517 --> 36:18.596
I think I've put everything in.

36:18.597 --> 36:20.916
Your packet's here, my lady.
Thank you.

36:20.917 --> 36:24.036
I don't think there's anything too
difficult to fasten.

36:24.037 --> 36:25.997
Lord Gillingham can always help.

36:27.277 --> 36:29.716
Are you certain you know what you're
doing?

36:29.717 --> 36:31.677
I believe so.

36:35.037 --> 36:38.036
Anna, the way things are going,

36:38.037 --> 36:40.996
life will be lived in much closer
quarters in future.

36:40.997 --> 36:45.756
My grandparents lived in vast rooms
surrounded by staff.

36:45.757 --> 36:48.357
If they disagreed, they'd hardly have
known it.

36:49.157 --> 36:51.117
But it won't be like that for us.

36:52.157 --> 36:55.316
I must be sure I'm right to want this
man.

36:55.317 --> 36:57.277
As my friend...

36:57.757 --> 36:59.796
..as my lover...

36:59.797 --> 37:01.836
as my husband.

37:01.837 --> 37:03.797
Well, I think it's a big risk.

37:04.757 --> 37:08.476
Please. I can't be lectured twice in
one evening.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.996
I've already had a ticking off from
Mr Blake.

37:10.997 --> 37:14.717
You didn't tell him. Only that I
thought Lord Gillingham was the one.

37:15.917 --> 37:17.996
The point is I want to marry again.

37:17.997 --> 37:20.877
And I absolutely don't want to
divorce.

37:23.117 --> 37:25.637
Well, I wish you luck, my lady.

37:33.237 --> 37:35.237
Morning.

37:38.013 --> 37:41.233
There you are. I'm afraid it's the
perfect position for me.

37:41.283 --> 37:45.753
Millions of men killed, my lord,
and we'll remember them

37:45.762 --> 37:49.122
with a stone cross for women to stop
by and gossip?

37:49.123 --> 37:54.003
I prefer to say that as people go
about their business, we remind them
of the men who died.

37:54.004 --> 37:57.723
They gave their lives for our
freedom and we'll remember them with

37:57.724 --> 38:01.602
a convenient step to sit for a
moment and tie up your shoelace.

38:03.843 --> 38:07.123
Afternoon, my lord. Hello,
Mrs Elkith. What are you up to?

38:07.124 --> 38:09.202
I'm just waiting for our Robbie.

38:09.203 --> 38:12.523
He likes to say hello to his father
sometimes after school.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.882
It's good of you to make a special
journey.

38:14.883 --> 38:17.802
Oh, no. He comes with me when I'm on
the way to the shop

38:17.803 --> 38:21.202
or the post office and takes a
chance to visit the grave then.

38:21.203 --> 38:25.683
My Bob was a lovely man and a
wonderful dad and I don't want our
Robbie to forget him.

38:25.684 --> 38:28.282
Not if I can help it.

38:28.283 --> 38:31.682
No. No, of course you don't.

38:31.683 --> 38:35.562
Thank you, Mrs Elkith. Your words
have made quite an impression on me.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.602
Don't you agree, Carson?

38:37.603 --> 38:40.883
I do, yes. Quite an impression.

38:42.203 --> 38:44.163
My lord.

38:51.243 --> 38:54.242
Why is it called a wireless when
there's so many wires?

38:54.243 --> 38:56.203
I don't know.

39:08.163 --> 39:10.202
Nothing's happening.

39:10.203 --> 39:12.163
It's just warming up, my lady.

39:19.443 --> 39:21.403
Is that Jack Hylton?!

39:23.043 --> 39:25.003
Oh, golly, isn't this thrilling?!

39:26.363 --> 39:28.442
What's this I see?

39:28.443 --> 39:32.202
Servants loitering in the hall with
her ladyship due at any moment.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.562
Look at that. If I touch it,
will I get a shock?

39:35.563 --> 39:38.522
You'll only get a shock if you
listen to it.

39:38.523 --> 39:41.602
I think it's exciting.
We're catching up, Mr Carson.

39:41.603 --> 39:45.763
Whether you like it or not, Downton
is catching up with the times we lived in.

39:45.764 --> 39:48.443
That is exactly what I am afraid of.

40:01.243 --> 40:03.203
Hello.

40:06.443 --> 40:09.642
Before I go, I hope we're all united
in the plan.

40:09.643 --> 40:13.883
It's very kind of you, my lady.
Isn't it, Margie? Very kind.

40:15.563 --> 40:18.483
I just want every opportunity for
little Marigold.

40:18.484 --> 40:21.923
It's very generous. And you won't
mind me being part of her life?

40:23.923 --> 40:28.523
She needs a chance to dream. You
mustn't fill her head with too many
dreams, my lady.

40:28.524 --> 40:31.922
This is a wonderful opportunity
you're offering. Thank you.

40:31.923 --> 40:33.883
I'll see you soon.

40:37.963 --> 40:40.563
Bye-bye.
Bye.

40:48.003 --> 40:51.082
What's the matter?
Why should anything be the matter?

40:51.083 --> 40:53.162
You could have been more gracious.

40:53.163 --> 40:55.722
I don't want this place to be her
doll's house.

40:55.723 --> 40:58.282
And Marigold her doll. To be kissed
and petted

40:58.283 --> 41:00.522
and cast aside when she loses
interest.

41:00.523 --> 41:03.642
She won't lose interest.
How can you be sure? I am sure.

41:03.643 --> 41:07.282
I'll be in the yard. Tell me when
the food's ready.

41:07.283 --> 41:09.362
Hands, please.

41:09.363 --> 41:14.562
"It gives me the greatest pleasure
and satisfaction

41:14.563 --> 41:18.322
to come here today with the Queen

41:18.323 --> 41:23.162
for the purpose of opening the
British Empire Exhibition."

41:23.163 --> 41:27.602
I suppose he can't hear us.
No, it doesn't work like that.

41:27.603 --> 41:29.723
..the board of management."

41:37.483 --> 41:39.443
Miss Mary Crawley.

41:40.683 --> 41:44.202
Welcome to Liverpool, Miss Crawley.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

41:44.203 --> 41:46.163
I'm sure I will.

42:09.203 --> 42:13.282
Well, you have heard the voice of
His Majesty King George V.

42:13.283 --> 42:16.842
What do you think, Carson? Mrs
Hughes, the King on the wireless?

42:16.843 --> 42:19.402
I prefer to think of him on his
throne, my lord.

42:19.403 --> 42:23.442
To me it's a good thing. To make him
less of a myth, more of a man.

42:23.443 --> 42:26.483
Well, I hope you've all taken
something of value from it.

42:32.723 --> 42:36.282
Mrs Hughes is right. The radio
somehow makes the King more real.

42:36.283 --> 42:39.562
The monarchy has thrived on magic
and mystery.

42:39.563 --> 42:43.922
Strip them away and people may think
the royal family is just like us.

42:43.923 --> 42:46.002
Well, would that be so wrong?

42:46.003 --> 42:49.043
Well, only if they want to stay at
Buckingham Palace.

42:50.843 --> 42:53.363
It was as though he was right in the
room with us.

43:00.083 --> 43:02.122
Cheer up, Mr Barrow.

43:02.123 --> 43:04.163
Weren't you pleased to hear the King?

43:05.163 --> 43:08.442
I expect it's difficult for you with
Jimmy gone.

43:08.443 --> 43:10.962
We all need a special friend from
time to time.

43:10.963 --> 43:14.282
I wasn't special to him. Not truly.

43:14.283 --> 43:17.082
I don't agree. I think he liked you.

43:17.083 --> 43:19.922
Maybe. A little.

43:19.923 --> 43:22.722
But I don't think I'm very likeable
to people here.

43:22.723 --> 43:24.802
Do you want to be?

43:24.803 --> 43:26.923
There are times when I'd like to
belong?

43:29.403 --> 43:31.363
Does that sound funny?

43:32.163 --> 43:34.123
Not to me. Not at all.

43:45.883 --> 43:48.642
Shall I have it collected in the
morning, my lord?

43:48.643 --> 43:52.402
Must he? Do we need to get rid of it
in quite such a hurry now it's here.

43:52.403 --> 43:55.922
Put it in the small library.
Thank you for changing your mind.

43:55.923 --> 43:58.042
I wasn't aware I'd decided against
it.

43:58.043 --> 44:00.122
You can clear this for now.

44:00.123 --> 44:03.523
It's such a pity Mary had to miss it
for a boring sketching trip.

44:21.003 --> 44:23.082
It's mad not to give a false name.

44:23.083 --> 44:26.323
Always make a lie as truthful as
possible.

44:27.243 --> 44:30.962
If you're seen, you have the right
name, you're alone in your room.

44:30.963 --> 44:33.003
And why shouldn't you be in
Liverpool?

44:35.763 --> 44:38.842
How did you manage to get the rooms
connected?

44:38.843 --> 44:40.803
Well, I'm not a complete halfwit.

44:41.643 --> 44:43.603
Nor, happily, is the manager.

44:45.243 --> 44:48.202
So, what's the plan?

44:48.203 --> 44:53.282
It's a simple one. We'll go down to
Church Street for a delicious dinner.

44:53.283 --> 44:56.722
After which, we'll come back.

44:56.723 --> 44:58.762
And... make love?

44:58.763 --> 45:00.802
Exactly.

45:00.803 --> 45:02.882
We'll make love all night.

45:02.883 --> 45:06.123
And, in fact, for as long as either
of us has any stamina left.

45:07.003 --> 45:08.963
And who can say fairer than that?

45:17.003 --> 45:19.922
I meant to ask how you got on this
morning.

45:19.923 --> 45:21.962
Oh, we've settled it.

45:21.963 --> 45:23.923
It's going to be in the village.

45:24.683 --> 45:27.362
Well, I hope you're not too upset.

45:27.363 --> 45:29.442
I only asked to be convinced.

45:29.443 --> 45:31.962
My walk through the village
convinced me.

45:31.963 --> 45:35.322
And... there's a bonus.
What's that?

45:35.323 --> 45:39.162
It puts us back in agreement,
Mrs Hughes.

45:39.163 --> 45:42.163
I'm not comfortable when you and I
are not in agreement.

45:43.923 --> 45:46.002
You're very flattering.

45:46.003 --> 45:49.803
With talk like that you make me want
to check to see that my hair's tidy.

45:49.963 --> 45:52.523
Get away with you.
No, I mean it.

45:54.603 --> 45:59.042
There's a policeman to see you,
Mr Carson. A policeman?

45:59.043 --> 46:01.242
It's just Sergeant Willis,
Mr Carson.

46:01.243 --> 46:03.322
Hello, Mr Willis.

46:03.323 --> 46:07.522
Thank you, Mr Barrow. You're
scaremongering has not succeeded.

46:07.523 --> 46:10.202
That'll be all. Sit down, Mr Willis.

46:10.203 --> 46:12.322
Have a cup of tea.

46:12.323 --> 46:17.842
How can I help you?
Well, it's an odd business but we
may as well get down to it.

46:17.843 --> 46:23.162
A man stayed here last year, Mr Alex
Green. Worked for Lord Gillingham.

46:23.163 --> 46:27.722
I remember him well. Why wouldn't I when
he died so very tragically not long after?

46:27.723 --> 46:32.443
Well, that's all I need. I've just been told
to check that you remember him. Thank you.

46:32.444 --> 46:35.762
And to give warning that we might
need to ask some questions.

46:35.763 --> 46:37.802
I don't understand.

46:37.803 --> 46:39.922
Well, something's turned up.

46:39.923 --> 46:44.362
And before they take it further, they're
trying to establish its significance.

46:44.363 --> 46:46.323
But what is that? What's turned up?

46:47.043 --> 46:49.003
A witness.

47:00.203 --> 47:04.242
What would it be like to go somewhere
no-one knows us? Why do you say that?

47:04.243 --> 47:08.882
If a man seduced me, I would not let
any grass grow under his feet.

47:08.883 --> 47:12.403
I want you to tell me the missing
element of your story? If I don't?

47:12.843 --> 47:15.282
She can't have our child and that's
flat!

47:15.283 --> 47:17.962
Allow me to present Prince Kuragin.

47:17.963 --> 47:20.323
Goodness! Granny has a past.

47:20.448 --> 47:23.160
