00:01.002 --> 00:02.518
Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:04.070 --> 00:06.071
-Up.
Harvey's in the shaft,

00:06.157 --> 00:07.489
all by himself,
no way to communicate.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.108
We don't know where he's at.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.276
Did you ever see him?

00:11.345 --> 00:12.310
How long has he been in now?

00:12.413 --> 00:14.413
32 minutes.

00:14.498 --> 00:16.347
-Uh. This is a big hit.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.384
Do you want to dig it?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.335
What's that? Oh, wow.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.421
Here's what you've
been waiting for, gentlemen.

00:22.506 --> 00:23.839
All right. Let's see it.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.174
-Whoa!
-What is it?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.842
A Roman sword.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.293
That is phenomenal.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.866
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:33.951 --> 00:35.951
where people have been looking

00:36.070 --> 00:40.472
for an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:40.574 --> 00:44.076
So far, they have found
bits of gold chain,

00:44.145 --> 00:48.280
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it...

00:48.315 --> 00:51.517
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.453
To date, six men have died

00:54.522 --> 00:56.288
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.575 --> 01:00.042
And, according to legend,

01:00.161 --> 01:02.127
one more will have to die

01:02.213 --> 01:04.596
before the treasure
can be found.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.219
I can hear you.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.521
Can you hear me?

01:35.946 --> 01:38.580
Michael, do you copy?

01:42.203 --> 01:43.952
For Rick and Marty Lagina

01:44.038 --> 01:47.005
and their partners,
a day that started

01:47.091 --> 01:50.008
with the promise of
exciting new discoveries

01:50.094 --> 01:53.846
has quickly turned
into one of possible danger.

01:58.469 --> 01:59.935
Comm check, Michael.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.854
Can you hear me?

02:03.808 --> 02:08.776
After months of
searching for underwater divers

02:08.863 --> 02:11.313
with both the experience
and courage

02:11.432 --> 02:14.116
to risk the perilous
235-foot dive

02:14.201 --> 02:17.202
to get to the bottom
of Borehole 10-X,

02:17.288 --> 02:19.288
they decided to engage
professional divers

02:19.373 --> 02:22.291
Harvey Morash

02:22.376 --> 02:25.443
and his safety backup,
diver Michael Gerhartz.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.546
We're going to try to be
as efficient as possible,

02:27.631 --> 02:28.714
but as safe as possible.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.082
We can't eliminate risk,

02:30.167 --> 02:31.166
but we can mitigate it.

02:37.174 --> 02:39.508
But now, just minutes
into the much-anticipated dive,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.143
they have suddenly

02:41.262 --> 02:43.962
lost all communication.

02:44.014 --> 02:45.630
We started with high hopes

02:45.733 --> 02:46.631
and now they're...
they're not even

02:46.734 --> 02:48.183
to ten feet in the shaft

02:48.269 --> 02:49.518
and... problems.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.871
Comms test, Michael,
can you hear me?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.573
The only communications system,

02:54.608 --> 02:57.159
linked between Michael

02:57.278 --> 03:00.195
and dive supervisor Janine
Goyetche on the surface,

03:00.281 --> 03:02.247
is suddenly not working.

03:07.504 --> 03:10.539
Michael, can you hear me now?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.993
I don't think we've got comms.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.663
How come we can hear him
breathing, then?

03:18.716 --> 03:22.167
You can hear him breathing.

03:22.269 --> 03:25.721
Because exploring
the mysterious chamber

03:25.806 --> 03:28.023
that lies at the bottom of 10-X

03:28.108 --> 03:30.342
involves not only a descent

03:30.444 --> 03:33.511
down a 181-foot-deep shaft

03:33.614 --> 03:36.398
made of both
steel casing and concrete,

03:36.483 --> 03:39.318
but also a 44-foot descent

03:39.403 --> 03:42.287
through a narrow,
27-inch-wide tunnel,

03:42.323 --> 03:46.191
Harvey Morash decided against
wearing a comms system

03:46.243 --> 03:48.577
in order to prevent
any possibility

03:48.662 --> 03:50.195
of becoming tangled.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.631
But now safety diver

03:52.716 --> 03:56.168
Michael Gerhartz's comms system
is malfunctioning,

03:56.253 --> 03:58.536
and the fate of both divers

03:58.639 --> 04:01.473
is frighteningly unknown.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.709
Mike doesn't know
whether we can hear him.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.712
Let's say he's trying to say,
um, "My leg is caught"

04:07.815 --> 04:10.682
or, you know, "Send down
another tank of air."

04:10.768 --> 04:13.385
He doesn't know whether
we can hear it, so that's...

04:13.437 --> 04:15.153
very bad.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.857
(rattling, hissing)

04:22.863 --> 04:26.448
How about now
Michael, can you hear me?

04:26.533 --> 04:29.084
At that point we have no input,

04:29.169 --> 04:31.670
and for me that's very
frustrating. I'm hands-on.

04:31.755 --> 04:34.456
I want to get involved.
I want to get things done,

04:34.541 --> 04:36.425
but you have
to take a step back

04:36.510 --> 04:38.743
and let the professionals
deal with this issue.

04:38.796 --> 04:40.745
15 minutes.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.764
Surface comms check Michael,

04:42.883 --> 04:44.766
do you read?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.135
(rattling, hissing)

04:49.690 --> 04:51.273
He's not hearing me.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.225
I can hear him, but I...

05:03.871 --> 05:05.787
I think he said abort the dive.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.956
He did.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.612
Okay, he's coming back up.

05:14.665 --> 05:16.665
It's the classic
"oh, crud" moment.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.084
They're aborting the dive.

05:19.136 --> 05:21.303
At the time
I was thinking, "Big deal.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.472
He's gonna come up,
fix the comms, and go back in."

05:23.590 --> 05:24.973
That's what I thought.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.309
I did, too. I thought,
"Well, this isn't a...

05:27.428 --> 05:30.295
"this isn't gonna
stop things proceeding.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.563
It's just a glitch."

05:33.767 --> 05:35.851
I see light.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.653
There he is.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.439
-He's at the surface.
-He's at surface.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.811
Up.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.864
Now that the dive
has been aborted,

05:48.949 --> 05:50.582
Michael Gerhartz
will be removed

05:50.667 --> 05:53.168
from 10-X first.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.003
No comms, huh?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.339
 Right.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.757
Great.

05:58.842 --> 06:00.292
Of great concern

06:00.377 --> 06:01.510
to Rick and Marty Lagina

06:01.595 --> 06:02.827
is the fate

06:02.930 --> 06:04.963
of diver Harvey Morash,

06:05.015 --> 06:07.599
who, with no means
of direct communication

06:07.634 --> 06:09.667
with the team at the surface,

06:09.770 --> 06:11.636
remains below.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.472
Did you ever see him,
were you ever by him?

06:13.574 --> 06:15.474
No, I didn't even see his light.

06:15.559 --> 06:17.309
So Mike comes up,

06:17.394 --> 06:19.394
he tells us
he never saw Harvey.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.896
Even... He knows
he was just above him

06:20.981 --> 06:22.614
and never even saw his light,

06:22.649 --> 06:24.866
that's how bad
visibility is in there.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.953
Making the situation
with the dive

06:27.988 --> 06:31.573
not just problematic
but possibly dangerous

06:31.658 --> 06:34.409
is the fact that, since
the communication malfunction

06:34.495 --> 06:37.462
happened immediately after
Michael was in the water,

06:37.548 --> 06:39.531
he didn't have a chance
to connect

06:39.633 --> 06:41.666
his tether line to Harvey.

06:41.718 --> 06:44.336
And now the team at the surface

06:44.421 --> 06:47.773
has no idea
if Harvey is in trouble.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.874
So Mike says

06:49.927 --> 06:51.543
pound six times on the pipe

06:51.645 --> 06:53.845
so Harvey knows
that the dive is off.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.819
That he should hear.

07:00.904 --> 07:04.856
That should ring really loud
in the water, shouldn't it?

07:04.908 --> 07:06.441
Should go down that pipe.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.745
He knows by now

07:10.831 --> 07:13.231
you're out of the hole
or he'd see you, right? Yeah.

07:13.283 --> 07:16.451
It has been almost 30 minutes

07:16.537 --> 07:19.588
and still no sign
of Harvey Morash.

07:19.706 --> 07:23.475
Could he have decided
to explore 10-X on his own?

07:23.544 --> 07:27.295
Or could it be that something
has gone terribly wrong?

07:27.381 --> 07:29.714
He's not surfacing.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.083
You know, in the back of my
mind, I'm thinking if this

07:32.186 --> 07:33.768
goes too long, then
I'm gonna start worrying

07:33.887 --> 07:37.022
he's caught somehow
and he can't communicate.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.890
Harvey's in the shaft
all by himself,

07:38.976 --> 07:40.609
no way to communicate.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.811
So, look, I'm concerned.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.980
We don't know where he's at.
We don't know

07:45.065 --> 07:47.065
if he's tied up with something.

07:47.151 --> 07:48.984
We don't know
if he's able to surface.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.436
There's lots of things
going through my mind.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.405
Let's get this guy
out of the hole.

07:53.490 --> 07:55.824
How long has he been in now?

07:55.909 --> 07:58.493
30 minutes, 32 minutes.

08:20.350 --> 08:23.018
Suddenly, a light is seen

08:23.103 --> 08:25.904
just below the water's surface.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.807
-Okay, there he is.
-There he is.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.359
He's up.

08:31.445 --> 08:33.645
Hey, Harvey, welcome back!

08:33.697 --> 08:35.864
About time.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.816
Yeah, I'll bet it is.

08:38.869 --> 08:40.001
You can feel the tension drop.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.785
You can feel it, you know.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.988
Nobody wants to lose
the guy in the hole.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.424
I mean, it's just,
it's not worth it.

08:46.510 --> 08:47.759
Did you see anything?

08:47.844 --> 08:50.362
The visibility is
unbelievably horrible!

08:50.430 --> 08:51.546
-Hmm.
-(laughter)

08:51.632 --> 08:52.881
Okay!

08:56.770 --> 08:58.470
There we go.

08:58.555 --> 08:59.888
When Harvey comes
to surface and he says,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.673
"Hi, guys," you know,
I'm like that.

09:01.775 --> 09:02.724
Okay, he's fine, he's safe.

09:02.809 --> 09:03.975
Okay, the eagle has landed.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.860
Or maybe the duck.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.946
But then reality

09:08.031 --> 09:10.282
comes back to,
well, what happened?

09:10.317 --> 09:12.067
Where were you?
Where did you go?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.451
Why didn't the comm lines work?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.820
How do we address it?

09:15.872 --> 09:18.156
I mean, there's 55 questions
that come to mind.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.692
Could you see what
is on the bottom at all?

09:20.794 --> 09:22.994
-Is it...?
-It's just a whole crapload

09:23.046 --> 09:25.497
of everything that's
raining down from up top.

09:25.582 --> 09:27.082
Like, it-it
I had probably

09:27.167 --> 09:29.534
about five feet of vis, maybe.

09:29.586 --> 09:31.670
And it was, like, milky vis.
And then all of a sudden

09:31.755 --> 09:33.838
it was just like somebody took a
shroud and just went right down

09:33.941 --> 09:35.640
over it. But, uh, I heard

09:35.726 --> 09:38.643
the banging. And as soon
as I heard that, I said, "Okay,

09:38.729 --> 09:40.679
well, dive's over."
But I wouldn't call it

09:40.764 --> 09:42.063
a complete failure,
because we did learn something

09:42.149 --> 09:44.215
about the hole.
No matter how careful you are...

09:44.318 --> 09:46.351
No, no, no, no, no.
I wouldn't call it a failure.

09:46.403 --> 09:47.902
We called it a tie, Harvey.
We...

09:48.021 --> 09:49.053
I asked David on the way up.

09:49.106 --> 09:49.938
I said, "Who won?" He said,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.406
"I'd call it a draw."

09:51.491 --> 09:52.774
-Well,

09:52.859 --> 09:55.560
-we came out of the hole alive,
-Yep.

09:55.662 --> 09:58.163
-safe, warm, comfortable.
-Yeah, that's huge. Okay,

09:58.198 --> 10:00.565
I'll tell you what. You guys
de-kit, get comfortable.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.784
Meet us in the war room
we'll plan tomorrow's dive.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.119
-Awesome. Okay.
-Okay.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.704
-Great.
-Knowing that Harvey Morash

10:05.756 --> 10:09.090
is safe allows
the Oak Island team

10:09.209 --> 10:12.093
to finally breathe
a sigh of relief.

10:12.212 --> 10:16.181
At least, for now.

10:21.659 --> 10:24.743
All right, guys,
you were in the hole.

10:24.829 --> 10:26.028
You made it to bottom.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.530
Tomorrow's another day.

10:28.633 --> 10:29.965
What are we gonna do?

10:30.051 --> 10:32.418
After their aborted

10:32.503 --> 10:35.554
attempt
to explore Borehole 10-X,

10:35.640 --> 10:37.806
Rick, Marty, and members of

10:37.892 --> 10:41.010
the Oak Island team meet
in the war room with divers

10:41.062 --> 10:43.045
Harvey Morash
and Michael Gerhartz.

10:43.147 --> 10:44.880
Also present

10:44.982 --> 10:47.182
are dive supervisor
Janine Goyetche

10:47.268 --> 10:50.819
and safety diver John Tapper.

10:50.905 --> 10:53.772
The dive, okay.
I did go to bottom.

10:53.858 --> 10:56.892
I went down. It was an easy
ascent down. Just stopped

10:56.994 --> 10:58.827
around 125 and got myself nice

10:58.863 --> 11:02.164
and horizontal as you can
in that confined space

11:02.249 --> 11:04.950
and then just eased on down.

11:05.036 --> 11:08.270
Since the water in 10-X

11:08.372 --> 11:11.790
is approximately 50 feet below
ground level,

11:11.876 --> 11:15.744
Harvey Morash's
125-foot descent

11:15.796 --> 11:19.098
only reached the part
of the shaft where it narrows

11:19.183 --> 11:22.351
to a very tight 27-inch width.

11:22.436 --> 11:24.386
We now know
that no matter what we do,

11:24.438 --> 11:27.056
be as careful as you want,
it's gonna be zero visibility.

11:27.141 --> 11:28.857
I had less than a minute

11:28.943 --> 11:30.859
that I could actually see
some stuff on the bottom.

11:30.945 --> 11:32.861
What about comms?

11:32.947 --> 11:34.363
The full face mask,

11:34.398 --> 11:37.099
from what I understand,
worked very well

11:37.151 --> 11:39.568
communicating from the diver
to the surface.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.705
-Right. -Unfortunately,
from the surface down

11:42.790 --> 11:46.075
to the diver,
I was not able to hear.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.493
I may be able

11:47.578 --> 11:50.913
to get another mask,
earpieces, and mic,

11:50.965 --> 11:52.331
along with some other parts.

11:52.416 --> 11:53.882
So depending
on where the problem

11:53.968 --> 11:57.002
was at, we may have a fix for it
tomorrow.

11:57.088 --> 12:00.839
I can pick it up in-in Halifax
around 7:30.

12:00.925 --> 12:03.759
-I'll be here
around 8:30, 9:00. -Okay,

12:03.844 --> 12:06.645
so you would be willing
to dive again?

12:07.698 --> 12:09.231
What I'm really

12:09.316 --> 12:10.966
wondering is he gonna say,

12:11.068 --> 12:13.802
"Hey, no problem.
Let's keep going"?

12:13.854 --> 12:16.855
Or is he gonna say, "Look,
this is too big a nut to crack"?

12:21.328 --> 12:22.661
Yeah.

12:24.498 --> 12:26.615
All right.
So let's talk about the dive.

12:26.667 --> 12:27.983
What's your timeline
for tomorrow?

12:28.035 --> 12:29.952
We should be able
to get in the water

12:30.004 --> 12:31.920
by noon 'cause we don't have
to rig up everything

12:32.006 --> 12:33.622
-that we had.
-Okay, so we have a dive

12:33.674 --> 12:35.257
at noon and maybe one at 5:00.

12:35.292 --> 12:37.159
Yeah, because daylight or dark

12:37.211 --> 12:39.161
doesn't really matter to us
down there.

12:41.799 --> 12:43.882
At the end of the meeting,
I think everyone

12:43.968 --> 12:46.135
got all
the information necessary.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.971
So we learned a lot of things,
and that was part of this dive,

12:49.023 --> 12:51.857
this initiation dive,
was to learn these things.

12:51.942 --> 12:54.977
Well, we knew today was gonna be
a learning day, so we learned.

12:55.029 --> 12:58.847
Oak Island did not win today.
Neither did we.

12:58.949 --> 13:02.551
But we're content
and set a plan for tomorrow.

13:02.653 --> 13:04.119
 You guys have
to understand a draw

13:04.205 --> 13:06.071
is huge on Oak Island.

13:06.157 --> 13:07.573
-That's good enough.

13:07.658 --> 13:09.191
That's good enough.
Let's be done.

13:09.293 --> 13:11.493
-All right. See-see you
in the morning. -Cool.

13:18.002 --> 13:20.969
As a new day begins
on Oak Island,

13:21.005 --> 13:25.307
Rick, Marty, and their partners
are eager to get back to 10-X

13:25.392 --> 13:27.976
and make another attempt
at finding out what,

13:28.012 --> 13:30.729
if anything,
lies at the bottom.

13:30.848 --> 13:32.765
So, we're rolling
across the causeway,

13:32.850 --> 13:34.817
we're full of expectations,

13:34.902 --> 13:36.819
and we're excited because we

13:36.904 --> 13:39.822
have not just one but
probably two dives scheduled.

13:39.924 --> 13:44.993
And we're gonna get a person
into the chamber in 10-X.

13:45.079 --> 13:46.779
David's here.

13:46.864 --> 13:49.364
Although the combination

13:49.450 --> 13:51.333
of sediment
and rusty ocean water

13:51.402 --> 13:54.753
presents a formidable challenge
to visibility,

13:54.839 --> 13:57.873
Marty, Rick, and their partners
are afraid

13:57.925 --> 13:59.625
that draining the shaft dry

13:59.710 --> 14:03.045
would make it
dangerously unstable.

14:03.097 --> 14:07.082
They are equally convinced
that only human intelligence

14:07.184 --> 14:10.119
can determine if the objects
that Dan Blankenship believes

14:10.187 --> 14:14.439
he saw more than four decades
ago really do exist

14:14.558 --> 14:16.809
at the bottom of 10-X.

14:19.230 --> 14:21.029
Rick.

14:21.065 --> 14:22.931
Morning, guys!

14:22.983 --> 14:24.366
Huh?

14:28.989 --> 14:31.290
You guys ready to get wet?

14:31.375 --> 14:32.991
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

14:33.077 --> 14:34.409
-Not quite.
-No?

14:34.461 --> 14:38.297
-No.
-What's up?

14:38.382 --> 14:40.165
We came upon a technical problem

14:40.251 --> 14:42.634
with the full face mask
that we had.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.304
We have two issues with it.
One issue

14:45.422 --> 14:47.973
is the communications side
that wasn't working

14:48.092 --> 14:51.059
the way it is designed to work.

14:51.145 --> 14:55.898
And the other issue is the work
of breathing of the mask.

14:55.983 --> 15:00.352
We think we have
the communication issue settled.

15:00.437 --> 15:02.571
But the work of breathing,

15:02.606 --> 15:05.073
we cannot fix this here
right now.

15:05.159 --> 15:07.826
It's not a short-term fix.

15:07.912 --> 15:11.613
With the mask not working
the way it is designed,

15:11.699 --> 15:14.283
we do not have a safe piece
of equipment.

15:14.335 --> 15:18.203
And without a safe piece
of equipment, I can simply

15:18.289 --> 15:21.456
not guarantee for the safety
of the dive.

15:21.508 --> 15:24.793
And for that reason, we decided

15:24.879 --> 15:28.881
that it is better
to call the dive for today.

15:30.534 --> 15:32.467
I don't think it was

15:32.519 --> 15:34.336
-an easy decision
for Mike to make. -No,

15:34.438 --> 15:37.055
it is not an easy decision, but
I know it is the right decision

15:37.141 --> 15:39.057
-at the moment, so...
- Then that's fine.

15:39.143 --> 15:40.609
-You like breathing.
-I like

15:40.694 --> 15:42.361
-breathing very much, yes.

15:42.446 --> 15:45.280
 Well, look, guys,
the deal has always been

15:45.316 --> 15:47.816
you call it, you call it for any
reason, so I-I'm not gonna say

15:47.868 --> 15:50.369
-I'm not disappointed.
-We're disappointed, too.

15:50.454 --> 15:52.955
-We're disappointed, too. -I'm
very disappointed, okay? But

15:53.040 --> 15:55.290
I think it's courageous
to make a decision like this.

15:55.326 --> 15:58.193
At the end of the day, all
of us, we're on the same page.

15:58.262 --> 16:00.462
Safety, safety, safety,
safety, safety.

16:00.497 --> 16:02.331
It's a team effort,
and that's the goal, right?

16:02.416 --> 16:05.533
Any dive is come back
to surface safe.

16:05.586 --> 16:07.252
In my opinion, the most
courageous thing you did

16:07.338 --> 16:09.888
of all the things you did
was being honest with us.

16:09.974 --> 16:11.373
That's important.

16:11.425 --> 16:14.476
So here's the deal:

16:14.561 --> 16:16.261
-you guys get comfortable.
-Yeah.

16:16.347 --> 16:18.046
Um, uh, keep in touch

16:18.148 --> 16:20.682
-with us, and we'll decide
what we do next, okay? -Yeah.

16:20.768 --> 16:23.318
-I mean, again... Perfect.
-Perfect. Yeah. Yeah.

16:23.404 --> 16:25.687
-Thank you very much. All right.
-Thanks, guys. -Thank you.

16:25.773 --> 16:29.024
-All right. See you, guys.
-Thank you. -Thanks, guys.

16:29.109 --> 16:31.860
Although Rick, Marty,
Craig, and the other members

16:31.946 --> 16:34.613
of their team have become used
to setbacks

16:34.698 --> 16:39.501
while trying to solve the
220-year-old mystery, this one,

16:39.586 --> 16:42.287
which has once again frustrated
their attempt

16:42.373 --> 16:45.841
to get human intelligence
from the bottom of 10-X,

16:45.926 --> 16:49.011
has dealt them
an unusually bitter blow.

16:49.096 --> 16:50.929
Look,
it's Oak Island. You never

16:51.048 --> 16:54.082
expect things
to go completely smooth.

16:54.134 --> 16:56.468
We got a glitch.
They discerned it.

16:56.553 --> 16:59.187
They'll figure out how

16:59.273 --> 17:01.256
to deal with it,
and by the morrow,

17:01.308 --> 17:02.941
we'll-we'll be on track again.

17:12.768 --> 17:15.019
While the Oak Island team waits

17:15.104 --> 17:18.689
for divers Harvey Morash
and Michael Gerhartz

17:18.773 --> 17:22.159
to return to the island
and try, once again,

17:22.278 --> 17:24.478
to reach the mysterious
underwater cavern

17:24.579 --> 17:26.881
at the bottom of 10-X,

17:26.949 --> 17:28.815
Rick Lagina,
along with researcher

17:28.918 --> 17:31.785
and fellow treasure hunter,
Jack Begley,

17:31.854 --> 17:34.655
are determined
to make up for lost time

17:34.757 --> 17:37.391
and explore the area
on the island known

17:37.460 --> 17:39.710
as Nolan's Cross.

17:39.795 --> 17:42.546
Well, Jack,
I don't know about you,

17:42.632 --> 17:45.516
but you see that sign
right there?

17:45.635 --> 17:47.101
JACK (laughing): "No
Trespassing. Private Property"?

17:47.186 --> 17:48.552
For the first time,

17:48.638 --> 17:51.138
we can turn that around
and have it say "welcome."

17:51.190 --> 17:52.606
-I'm serious.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.174
"Welcome. F.G. Nolan."

17:54.277 --> 17:55.709
We have the right to

17:55.811 --> 17:59.063
jointly look for things
on... on Nolan's land,

17:59.148 --> 18:04.118
which basically gives us 95%
of the island to explore now.

18:04.203 --> 18:06.453
You get geared up
and find me something,

18:06.539 --> 18:08.739
I'll dig till...
I'll dig till whenever.

18:08.824 --> 18:10.374
All right.

18:10.459 --> 18:12.626
We wanted
to put the island back together

18:12.712 --> 18:15.596
in terms
of the discovery processes.

18:15.665 --> 18:19.550
And I think this agreement
gets us down that road.

18:19.635 --> 18:23.254
In 1981,

18:23.339 --> 18:26.240
while surveying his property
near the center of the island,

18:26.342 --> 18:30.060
Fred discovered five large,
cone-shaped boulders

18:30.179 --> 18:34.148
that formed a megalithic,
perfectly symmetrical cross.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.433
Believing there could be
something of great value

18:36.519 --> 18:39.153
buried at the center,

18:39.255 --> 18:43.407
Fred dug down several feet and
unearthed a sixth boulder

18:43.526 --> 18:49.029
one which appeared to be carved
into the shape of a human head.

18:49.098 --> 18:50.698
Now look right here.

18:50.783 --> 18:52.666
That looks like
it's been chiseled.

18:52.702 --> 18:55.502
-Yup.
-Here. Here. Here.

18:55.588 --> 18:58.205
Here. Here.

18:58.274 --> 19:01.575
Yeah, it looks like somebody,
you know, sha-shaped it.

19:01.644 --> 19:03.177
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-Mm.

19:03.262 --> 19:05.412
-Right through here?
-Yup.

19:05.514 --> 19:07.765
I mean, I see the eye,
the forehead,

19:07.883 --> 19:10.517
the shape of the forehead,
the nose.

19:10.603 --> 19:12.186
I see the... the mouth.

19:12.221 --> 19:13.687
That's a chin.

19:13.773 --> 19:16.056
 Definitely an interesting
shape. I mean, did you

19:16.142 --> 19:18.659
recognize this,
the face, right away?

19:18.728 --> 19:21.729
-Once we checked the distances,
you know? -Mm-hmm.

19:21.781 --> 19:24.481
That's when it showed itself.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.116
It's very curious.

19:26.235 --> 19:27.434
My first time seeing it,
it's-it's...

19:27.536 --> 19:30.154
it's intriguing.

19:31.707 --> 19:34.241
 This is the arm
of the cross. We...

19:34.343 --> 19:36.877
Right through there,
I suspect, is the

19:36.979 --> 19:39.079
bottom of the cross.
I've never... I've seen it

19:39.148 --> 19:41.048
but one time.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.667
In addition to the boulders

19:43.786 --> 19:45.719
that form Nolan's Cross,

19:45.788 --> 19:49.623
Oak Island researchers have
also discovered a number

19:49.692 --> 19:51.659
of smaller, flat-sided stones

19:51.761 --> 19:55.763
which lie buried
at several precise locations.

19:55.865 --> 19:58.182
The placement of these stones,

19:58.267 --> 20:00.818
when viewed in context
of the larger ones,

20:00.936 --> 20:03.537
eerily corresponds
to what are referred to

20:03.606 --> 20:05.572
as "the ten Sephirot"

20:05.675 --> 20:08.976
the markers that make up what
is known in the Hebrew Bible

20:09.045 --> 20:12.212
as "Kabbalah," or what is
otherwise called

20:12.314 --> 20:13.814
"The Tree of Life."

20:13.866 --> 20:15.582
But for Oak Island theorists,

20:15.685 --> 20:19.253
the presence of
The Tree of Life suggests

20:19.321 --> 20:22.423
that what is buried on
the island could actually be

20:22.491 --> 20:26.593
sacred treasure, especially
as the ancient symbol

20:26.679 --> 20:28.662
was considered important
in the rituals

20:28.764 --> 20:30.464
of the Knights Templar

20:30.566 --> 20:34.134
and was later adopted
by the Rosicrucians

20:34.220 --> 20:36.687
and even the Freemasons.

20:36.772 --> 20:41.058
You know,
I've always wanted to do this

20:41.143 --> 20:44.228
'cause you know,
I always thought, someday

20:44.313 --> 20:46.697
-maybe we can put the island
back together. -Yeah.

20:46.782 --> 20:49.366
Heal it emotionally or put it
back together physically.

20:49.485 --> 20:51.518
Well, and you've worked
really hard on doing that.

20:51.587 --> 20:54.521
Well, we all have,
but I, for my part,

20:54.590 --> 20:57.558
even in my old age,

20:57.660 --> 20:59.626
I'd kind of like to climb
on here and stand on it.

21:04.133 --> 21:06.366
Now if only I could see,
"X marks the spot,"

21:06.469 --> 21:09.336
I'd be... I'd be doing good.

21:09.405 --> 21:12.539
 -The thing is,
is, you know, you stand on this,

21:12.641 --> 21:15.342
and you realize, if...

21:15.411 --> 21:18.645
if these really were put in
position for a specific reason,

21:18.748 --> 21:22.316
that reason was very, very
important to a lot of people,

21:22.384 --> 21:24.485
and I want
to know the reason why.

21:24.570 --> 21:25.769
I hope we get that chance.

21:25.855 --> 21:28.355
Let's go find something.

21:32.228 --> 21:34.161
I think
it's right through there.

21:34.246 --> 21:35.996
All right.
You lead the way.

21:38.934 --> 21:40.834
Tide's coming in fast.

21:40.936 --> 21:43.454
That's the one. That's the one.

21:43.572 --> 21:45.289
Look, it's already
half underwater.

21:45.374 --> 21:47.641
Yeah, well, we'll do the half
that's exposed.

21:47.710 --> 21:49.343
All right,
I'd better do this quick.

21:49.445 --> 21:51.411
-(beeping)
-Good thing this is waterproof!

21:51.480 --> 21:53.680
What stone
on the cross is this again?

21:53.749 --> 21:55.432
This is the left arm

21:55.551 --> 21:57.801
as you're looking
towards the top of the cross.

21:57.920 --> 22:02.456
Using the Minelab CTX
30/30 metal detector,

22:02.558 --> 22:07.027
which can isolate shallow
nonferrous or precious metals

22:07.096 --> 22:09.780
up to a maximum depth
of two feet,

22:09.899 --> 22:12.983
Jack Begley begins scanning the
ground around the stone marker.

22:13.102 --> 22:15.335
(beeping)

22:15.437 --> 22:17.538
There's a bunch of iron
all along the front of here.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.656
How deep?

22:19.742 --> 22:21.341
Six inches!

22:21.410 --> 22:23.243
Worth looking at.

22:25.014 --> 22:27.815
Will Rick and Jack
find evidence

22:27.917 --> 22:29.550
that will help them identify,

22:29.635 --> 22:31.335
not only
how old the arrangement

22:31.453 --> 22:33.887
of cross-shaped boulders are,

22:33.989 --> 22:35.556
but who placed them there?

22:35.641 --> 22:37.457
(beeping)

22:37.560 --> 22:41.428
Yeah, I'd...
I'd say it's along this edge.

22:46.001 --> 22:48.335
Right there.
What's that?

22:50.689 --> 22:52.806
I don't know.

22:52.908 --> 22:54.658
Whatis that, Rick?

22:54.743 --> 22:56.443
Washed up from a ship maybe?

22:56.545 --> 22:58.979
Looks like, a, uh...
some type of pulley.

22:59.081 --> 23:00.614
See how this is recessed?

23:00.716 --> 23:02.699
A pulley?

23:02.785 --> 23:08.455
In 1795, after seeing what
they believed to be a number

23:08.524 --> 23:10.924
of strange lights emanating
from Oak Island,

23:10.993 --> 23:13.293
area teenagers Daniel McGinnis,

23:13.362 --> 23:15.629
John Smith and Anthony Vaughan

23:15.714 --> 23:19.833
gathered together
in a small boat and traveled

23:19.902 --> 23:22.169
from the mainland
to investigate.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.976
At the spot where they believed
the lights had come from,

23:29.061 --> 23:32.012
they found an old oak tree,

23:32.064 --> 23:34.114
at the base of which appeared
to be a large,

23:34.183 --> 23:36.533
circular depression
in the ground.

23:36.619 --> 23:39.019
But what made them believe

23:39.071 --> 23:41.538
something had once been buried
there was the discovery

23:41.624 --> 23:45.826
of a large pulley hanging
from a branch of the oak tree,

23:45.895 --> 23:50.714
just over the middle
of the strange depression.

23:50.799 --> 23:53.000
Could there be a connection

23:53.052 --> 23:55.335
between the pulley
hanging from the oak tree

23:55.421 --> 23:59.423
220 years ago
and the one just discovered

23:59.508 --> 24:02.009
by Rick Lagina and Jack Begley?

24:02.061 --> 24:04.761
Show it to Dan
and see what he thinks.

24:04.847 --> 24:06.446
Now let me bag and tag it.

24:06.515 --> 24:07.981
For Rick Lagina,

24:08.050 --> 24:09.733
the discovery of a pulley

24:09.852 --> 24:11.818
near one of the strange,
megalithic boulders

24:11.887 --> 24:13.553
that make up Nolan's Cross

24:13.622 --> 24:16.657
has provided him
a small victory.

24:16.742 --> 24:21.595
But, for him, there is a more
important battle to be waged.

24:21.697 --> 24:24.397
The one to find out what,
if anything,

24:24.500 --> 24:28.585
lies at the bottom
of Borehole 10-X.

24:33.537 --> 24:36.839
Today,y, finalally,
for r the first t time a all ,

24:36.924 --> 24:39.925
-today is the day of answers.
-Hopefully.

24:40.044 --> 24:42.845
After a delay of four days,

24:42.930 --> 24:45.631
Harvey Morash and his safety
diver, Michael Gerhartz,

24:45.716 --> 24:47.883
have returned to Oak Island.

24:47.935 --> 24:49.768
Where do you want this, Harvey?

24:49.854 --> 24:51.253
Just lay it beside me for now.

24:51.305 --> 24:53.522
Unfortunately,

24:53.557 --> 24:55.474
Marty Lagina
has been called away

24:55.559 --> 24:57.726
on important business
and will have to miss

24:57.778 --> 25:00.863
what could be
one of the most important days

25:00.948 --> 25:05.267
in the history of this
220-year-old treasure hunt.

25:05.319 --> 25:08.537
 As far as 10-X
is concerned, maybe tomorrow

25:08.572 --> 25:09.538
we'll have something.

25:09.573 --> 25:10.939
That'd be good.

25:11.041 --> 25:13.075
I had put my businesses on hold

25:13.127 --> 25:14.776
for as long as I could.
Had to go back

25:14.829 --> 25:16.611
to Michigan,
attend to business.

25:16.664 --> 25:18.547
I feel bad leaving
with Rick here,

25:18.632 --> 25:20.716
but I couldn't leave it
in better hands.

25:20.751 --> 25:22.417
Get yourself back up here,
you and Craig,

25:22.469 --> 25:25.220
-and we'll, uh, we'll
make 10-X happen. -Okay, Rick.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.589
-To the bottom.
-To the bottom.

25:27.641 --> 25:30.458
Let's make it happen
today, right?

25:30.561 --> 25:32.311
We'll try to get you
some answers.

25:32.396 --> 25:34.630
After making
the necessary repairs

25:34.732 --> 25:36.899
that will ensure that
their communication system

25:36.984 --> 25:40.402
will be fully functional,
the divers

25:40.487 --> 25:42.688
can now concentrate
on getting safely

25:42.773 --> 25:45.407
to the bottom of 10-X

25:45.442 --> 25:48.911
and finding out if objects,
like a wooden post...

25:49.013 --> 25:50.779
man-made tunnels...

25:50.831 --> 25:52.648
wooden chests...
and the remains

25:52.750 --> 25:54.283
of a human body...

25:54.368 --> 25:58.670
really do lie
235 feet underground.

25:58.756 --> 26:01.423
 Okay, we've
already gone over the dive plan

26:01.458 --> 26:05.594
with our comms operator
and Mike and myself, so...

26:05.629 --> 26:07.796
we're not gonna go
into that anymore.

26:07.882 --> 26:09.214
Just, for me you're going

26:09.300 --> 26:11.433
-to the bottom
of the bar, right? -Yeah.

26:11.518 --> 26:12.517
-All right?
-Let's make it happen.

26:12.636 --> 26:13.602
Let's go have some fun.

26:17.808 --> 26:20.342
Oak Island hooks people
in different ways,

26:20.444 --> 26:22.728
and I think the hook
for them has been,

26:22.813 --> 26:23.979
we're technically
skilled enough

26:24.064 --> 26:26.899
to conquer this and I think

26:26.984 --> 26:29.851
they were defeated last time,
if you want to know the truth.

26:29.904 --> 26:31.119
I think they were beaten,

26:31.155 --> 26:33.521
and they don't like
being beaten.

26:33.624 --> 26:36.024
Even though Rick,
Marty and their partners

26:36.076 --> 26:39.694
have spent a great deal
of time and money clearing 10-X

26:39.797 --> 26:42.464
of dangerous obstructions,

26:42.549 --> 26:44.533
there is still
one remaining obstacle

26:44.635 --> 26:48.253
that diver Harvey Morash
will have to contend with

26:48.339 --> 26:51.807
an approximately
20-foot-long drill bar

26:51.892 --> 26:55.427
that became wedged
in the narrow, 27-inch portion

26:55.512 --> 26:58.546
of the hole after it
was accidentally dropped

26:58.649 --> 27:01.099
some 40 years ago.

27:01.185 --> 27:03.902
 You don't think
the bar has moved at all?

27:04.989 --> 27:07.222
I don't think it has.

27:07.274 --> 27:09.891
Because I think the bottom
is on the bedrock

27:09.994 --> 27:11.660
where the chamber opens up,

27:11.695 --> 27:15.580
and she's wedged
against that top edge there,

27:15.699 --> 27:18.617
and the top of the bar is
on the opposite side.

27:18.702 --> 27:20.285
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
-That's what I tried

27:20.371 --> 27:22.070
to explain to him,
make damn sure

27:22.172 --> 27:25.040
-he didn't panic, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.411
MICHAEL (over radio):
Test, one, two, three.

27:29.513 --> 27:30.796
I gotcha.

27:30.914 --> 27:33.515
MICHAEL (over radio):
Okay. Loud and clear.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.968
Harvey will be inserted
in the man-basket.

27:36.053 --> 27:37.853
He'll dive ten, 12 feet.

27:37.955 --> 27:40.389
Basket comes up, gets Mike.

27:40.441 --> 27:43.859
Mike goes down,
and then they tether up.

27:43.944 --> 27:47.896
And then they dive in tandem
all the way to 181,

27:47.982 --> 27:50.615
and then, at that point,
they separate.

27:52.236 --> 27:54.536
Once again,
only Michael Gerhartz

27:54.571 --> 27:56.788
will be in direct voice contact

27:56.907 --> 27:59.491
with surface dive supervisor,
Janine Goyetche.

27:59.610 --> 28:03.745
As Harvey Morash makes
the perilous 44-foot dive

28:03.797 --> 28:06.798
down the narrow,
27-inch portion of the hole,

28:06.884 --> 28:08.800
his sole means of communication

28:08.886 --> 28:11.953
will be through a tether line
attached to Michael.

28:12.056 --> 28:13.839
One pull on the line

28:13.924 --> 28:16.892
will indicate
that everything is okay.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.493
How's your visibility?

28:18.595 --> 28:19.511
Eh...

28:27.104 --> 28:28.103
Copy that.

28:29.106 --> 28:31.189
Because 10-X was dug

28:31.275 --> 28:34.276
through layers of porous
anhydrite stone,

28:34.328 --> 28:36.978
the slightest movement
created by the divers

28:37.031 --> 28:41.183
kicks up thick, murky clouds
of silt and sediment.

28:41.251 --> 28:44.119
Visibility
is now virtually zero.

28:44.204 --> 28:46.288
Harvey's at 181?

28:46.373 --> 28:48.056
As far as we know;
we can't see him.

28:48.125 --> 28:50.525
How far has he got to go?

28:50.594 --> 28:52.127
We don't have much of this left.

28:52.212 --> 28:53.845
All right, Michael,

28:53.964 --> 28:56.298
you're almost at the end
of your tether here.

28:58.218 --> 29:01.870
It is now approximately
20 minutes into the dive,

29:01.939 --> 29:05.674
and the team on the surface
is growing anxious.

29:05.776 --> 29:07.392
They have no way to know

29:07.478 --> 29:09.895
exactly where
Harvey and Michael are,

29:09.980 --> 29:11.947
or how they are doing.

29:12.032 --> 29:14.282
I don't like sitting back

29:14.368 --> 29:16.151
and not being
a part of something.

29:16.203 --> 29:17.536
He's just tugging on the rope

29:17.654 --> 29:19.187
to let Michael know
that everything's okay.

29:19.289 --> 29:21.022
Every time
I got a little worked up,

29:21.125 --> 29:22.040
I thought: just settle down.

29:22.126 --> 29:23.625
You know, this is gonna evolve

29:23.660 --> 29:25.026
the way it's gonna evolve.

29:25.129 --> 29:27.712
Has Harvey successfully made it

29:27.831 --> 29:30.499
past the drill bar
and into the chamber

29:30.551 --> 29:32.700
at the bottom of the shaft?

29:32.753 --> 29:35.670
If so, what, if anything,

29:35.756 --> 29:37.556
did he find?

29:47.676 --> 29:49.993
Divers Harvey Morash
and Michael Gerhartz

29:50.095 --> 29:55.165
have been submerged in 10-X
for almost 30 minutes.

29:55.267 --> 29:57.134
Because Harvey can
only communicate with Michael

29:57.219 --> 29:59.219
by pulling on a tether line

29:59.305 --> 30:02.672
while attempting his dangerous
descent down the narrow,

30:02.775 --> 30:06.610
27-inch portion of the hole,
Rick Lagina and the team

30:06.695 --> 30:10.564
are starting to grow
more than a little anxious.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.849
-How deep is Harvey?
-We can't say for sure.

30:12.952 --> 30:15.152
-We don't have any comms
with Harvey, so... -Right.

30:15.237 --> 30:17.321
-What depth was he?
-I don't know how deep

30:17.406 --> 30:19.573
Harvey actually was
until we actually get him up

30:19.658 --> 30:22.242
-and see his computer.
-So he's on his descent?

30:22.328 --> 30:24.661
No, he's still kind of
messing around in there.

30:24.747 --> 30:26.079
He's just tugging on the rope

30:26.165 --> 30:28.048
to let Michael know
that everything's okay.

30:36.225 --> 30:37.975
Copy that.

30:42.982 --> 30:45.732
Copy. You have Harvey with you.

30:49.188 --> 30:50.821
Excellent.

30:50.856 --> 30:52.906
Although the divers

30:53.025 --> 30:54.858
have completed their dive,

30:54.943 --> 30:58.528
Rick and the team will have
to wait several more minutes,

30:58.597 --> 31:00.197
while the divers decompress,

31:00.282 --> 31:03.567
to find out what, if anything,
they discovered at the bottom.

31:03.669 --> 31:06.119
As the guys, Harvey and Mike,

31:06.205 --> 31:09.089
are going through
their decompression stops,

31:09.208 --> 31:10.573
I'm thinking,
well, what do they know?

31:10.676 --> 31:12.292
And what am I hoping to hear?

31:12.378 --> 31:14.094
And I couldn't wait for them
to get to surface.

31:25.691 --> 31:27.124
Basket down!

31:28.927 --> 31:30.927
Whoa!
-Whoa, whoa.

31:31.030 --> 31:35.065
- Ready to come up?
-Yes, sir!

31:35.117 --> 31:36.566
There you go.

31:39.738 --> 31:41.655
 How cold are you?

31:41.740 --> 31:43.206
Wasn't till the very end there

31:43.292 --> 31:45.826
where it started getting cold.

31:47.212 --> 31:49.079
-Give me a second, guys.
-Yeah.

31:53.052 --> 31:54.301
Well, that was interesting.

31:54.386 --> 31:57.003
Did you make it? I have to ask.
Did you make it?

31:57.122 --> 31:58.288
I got in the pipe.

31:58.390 --> 31:59.956
It was unbelievable.

32:00.008 --> 32:01.641
I've never... That's black.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.227
As soon as I went into the pipe,
it went like that.

32:04.263 --> 32:05.762
As soon as I went in.

32:05.848 --> 32:07.731
Were you all the way in?
In other words...

32:07.816 --> 32:09.983
Oh, my body was completely...
I was down inside it.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.634
 I was a good,
I'm gonna say,

32:11.737 --> 32:12.936
two body lengths, at least, in.

32:13.021 --> 32:14.821
-I could see the pipe...
-Mm-hmm.

32:14.940 --> 32:19.159
and then I just put my fin to it
and basically got myself in.

32:19.278 --> 32:21.445
-Mm-hmm. -And that's
when the lights went out,

32:21.530 --> 32:23.647
before my head even went
into the pipe...

32:23.749 --> 32:25.916
So you don't know
where your head was

32:26.001 --> 32:28.452
in relation
to the top of the casing?

32:28.554 --> 32:30.153
I was below the surface
'cause when I came out,

32:30.222 --> 32:31.705
I grabbed... I reached up,
and I could feel...

32:31.790 --> 32:33.840
So you were at least
a couple, three feet in.

32:33.926 --> 32:35.258
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I was more than that.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.877
Did you get past the casing?

32:36.962 --> 32:39.045
I think.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.847
-You don't know? -I think.
I don't know for sure, Rick,

32:40.933 --> 32:43.049
'cause I was trying to feel,
and it all felt the same, right?

32:43.135 --> 32:45.051
All rough, and...
I couldn't tell.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.887
I couldn't see anything.
Anything.

32:46.972 --> 32:49.773
It was just like cave training,
and it was, like, well, okay,

32:49.808 --> 32:51.358
I've done this,
but this is snugger

32:51.477 --> 32:53.310
than that other pipe
that I went into.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.195
-Really?
-Yep.

32:55.280 --> 32:56.563
Did you feel the drill bar?

32:56.648 --> 33:00.016
Yeah. But I had
no wiggle room whatsoever.

33:00.119 --> 33:02.869
Like, to get up...
to get back up,

33:02.988 --> 33:04.854
I was basically...

33:04.907 --> 33:07.457
I don't even know exactly what
I was doing, but I was kind of

33:07.543 --> 33:09.409
trying to push with my elbows
and that may have been...

33:09.528 --> 33:11.044
 That's where you
breached. -I breached my suit.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.963
I don't know, right?
But I didn't really feel

33:13.048 --> 33:15.415
any water coming in
until I was on the ascent.

33:15.501 --> 33:18.034
Although Harvey Morash

33:18.086 --> 33:19.369
was unable to bypass

33:19.471 --> 33:21.588
the drill bar and reach

33:21.673 --> 33:23.706
the mysterious
underwater cavern,

33:23.809 --> 33:27.144
he was able to get closer
than anyone has

33:27.229 --> 33:29.930
in the last two decades.

33:30.015 --> 33:31.765
At the end of the day,
my hat's off

33:31.850 --> 33:34.234
to Harvey and Mike
and Janine.

33:34.353 --> 33:36.820
They had come to the island
with a plan

33:36.905 --> 33:40.524
to get the answers we sought,
and I can't fault them

33:40.609 --> 33:42.859
in any way, shape, or form.
Look, the island

33:42.945 --> 33:46.296
can be a real tough nut,
as my brother says, you know?

33:46.365 --> 33:48.415
And... and today it was.

33:48.534 --> 33:51.067
The question which
begs to be asked is

33:51.170 --> 33:53.787
is this accomplishable?
Is it doable?

33:53.872 --> 33:56.790
To do this on scuba?
I don't know.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.842
All right, so it sounds like you
guys need to talk it over.

33:58.877 --> 34:00.927
Um, I know he wants
to talk it over on our end

34:01.046 --> 34:04.014
as well, so, uh, we'll do that
and get in touch with you guys.

34:04.049 --> 34:05.882
-Thank you. No problem.
 Thank you very much.

34:05.968 --> 34:08.083
-I appreciate everything
you've done. -Yeah, no problem.

34:08.152 --> 34:10.853
For Rick, Marty
and their partners,

34:10.938 --> 34:14.107
the promise of getting answers
from the bottom of 10-X

34:14.226 --> 34:17.893
which appeared to be very much
within their grasp

34:17.980 --> 34:19.896
now seems, more than ever,

34:19.982 --> 34:23.400
out of reach.

34:23.502 --> 34:26.369
But will they finally give up

34:26.405 --> 34:28.103
and focus their attention

34:28.172 --> 34:31.373
on other, more accessible areas
of the island?

34:31.409 --> 34:34.110
Or will they keep trying?

34:34.161 --> 34:35.777
We're gonna get this solved.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.414
We're gonna find out

34:37.498 --> 34:40.116
what's at the bottom of 10-X.

34:40.219 --> 34:43.003
I want to, my brother wants to,
Craig wants to.

34:43.088 --> 34:45.088
All of us want to.
And, specifically,

34:45.139 --> 34:47.007
I made a promise to David

34:47.092 --> 34:49.958
and to his mom and to Dan.

34:50.062 --> 34:52.429
We are gonna find out,
this year,

34:52.514 --> 34:54.764
what's in the bottom of 10-X.

34:58.937 --> 35:01.304
Shortly after
Rick's brother Marty

35:01.406 --> 35:02.973
returns to Oak Island,

35:03.075 --> 35:05.642
the team calls a meeting
in the war room

35:05.711 --> 35:08.578
to discuss important next steps
in their goal

35:08.664 --> 35:13.083
of getting human intelligence
from the bottom of 10-X.

35:13.118 --> 35:14.451
They have also been baited

35:14.519 --> 35:16.052
by the promise of being shown

35:16.154 --> 35:18.288
an exciting piece of evidence

35:18.373 --> 35:21.925
evidence that could totally
change everything they knew

35:22.027 --> 35:23.426
or thought they knew

35:23.462 --> 35:26.763
about the history
of the island, and what,

35:26.848 --> 35:29.883
exactly,
they may be looking for.

35:29.968 --> 35:31.801
Where's Charles? Let's talk
about where Charles is.

35:31.853 --> 35:33.937
They're about
to show up with something that,

35:34.039 --> 35:36.839
they say, is going to be
of extreme interest to us.

35:36.942 --> 35:38.525
- And here he is.
-ALEX: I can't wait to see it.

35:38.610 --> 35:39.809
-Gentlemen.
- Hey, guys.

35:39.861 --> 35:42.445
Hey, Charles. You got it!

35:42.481 --> 35:44.230
I got it. This is what

35:44.316 --> 35:47.150
-you've been waiting to see.
- All right.

35:47.202 --> 35:49.953
 Here's what you've been
waiting for, gentlemen.

35:50.038 --> 35:52.122
-ALEX: All right, let's see it.
- Let's see it.

35:54.459 --> 35:56.960
-Holy crap.
-Wow.

35:56.995 --> 35:57.994
Whoa.

36:06.162 --> 36:08.196
 All right, let's see it.

36:08.248 --> 36:09.897
-ALEX: Holy crap. -ALL: Wow.

36:09.949 --> 36:12.083
Whoa!

36:12.168 --> 36:13.784
During a meeting
in the war room,

36:13.870 --> 36:16.120
Charles Barkhouse
has just revealed to Rick,

36:16.206 --> 36:19.123
Marty and the team one of
the most incredible objects

36:19.209 --> 36:21.175
they have ever seen.

36:21.211 --> 36:22.376
What is it?

36:22.462 --> 36:24.178
It's a sword, a Roman sword.

36:24.214 --> 36:25.963
That is phenomenal.

36:26.049 --> 36:28.082
 This is something
that was found in the 1940s,

36:28.134 --> 36:31.269
in Mahone Bay, in the vicinity
of Oak Island.

36:31.387 --> 36:33.354
Well, wait a second,
I mean, let's back up

36:33.389 --> 36:35.306
before we get into detail
on this thing.

36:35.391 --> 36:37.424
How did you come into
the possession of this?

36:37.477 --> 36:40.311
What-what...
How did we get this?

36:40.396 --> 36:43.814
There was friends of Dan's,
isn't it?

36:43.900 --> 36:46.701
-Yes. That originally
started talking about it

36:46.736 --> 36:49.987
-and then Charles
found out about it. -Yes.

36:50.106 --> 36:52.206
A Roman sword

36:52.292 --> 36:54.458
found in the waters
of Mahone Bay,

36:54.577 --> 36:58.246
just off the coast
of Oak Island? But how?

36:58.298 --> 37:01.549
Where did it come from?
And what does it mean?

37:01.634 --> 37:03.050
When I first saw that sword

37:03.152 --> 37:04.502
I thought that's-that's unique.

37:04.587 --> 37:06.420
I've never seen
anything like this.

37:06.472 --> 37:08.789
It looked old. It's patina'd.

37:08.841 --> 37:10.474
Uh, you know,
it's not detailed anymore.

37:10.593 --> 37:13.678
And I suppose the salient point
is how heavy it is.

37:13.763 --> 37:15.429
It appeared to be
made out of bronze.

37:15.481 --> 37:17.315
Appeared to be well-weighted.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.183
 What year
would have this been made?

37:19.269 --> 37:20.467
Somewhere between the, uh,

37:20.570 --> 37:23.104
second and third
cen-century AD.

37:23.189 --> 37:25.606
It's a ceremonial gladius
that was presented

37:25.658 --> 37:28.159
by the emperor Commodus
in honor of

37:28.278 --> 37:29.443
the secutor gladiators.

37:29.529 --> 37:31.946
A ceremonial sword

37:32.031 --> 37:35.416
from the time
of the Roman emperor Commodus?

37:35.451 --> 37:39.053
Ruling from 180 to 192 AD,

37:39.122 --> 37:41.322
Lucius Aurelius Commodus

37:41.391 --> 37:43.758
was a flamboyant
and ruthless leader

37:43.860 --> 37:46.594
who, according
to contemporary accounts,

37:46.663 --> 37:49.397
believed himself
to be the reincarnation

37:49.499 --> 37:51.799
of the divine hero Hercules.

37:51.901 --> 37:54.435
Although most Roman leaders

37:54.520 --> 37:57.905
were content to enjoy watching
bloody gladiator battles

37:57.974 --> 37:59.890
from their throne
at the Colosseum,

37:59.976 --> 38:01.943
Commodus actually participated

38:02.011 --> 38:04.145
in the carnage himself.

38:04.197 --> 38:07.848
Could this sword actually have
a direct connection

38:07.900 --> 38:10.901
to the infamous
second-century Roman ruler?

38:10.987 --> 38:13.904
-Was that singularly a gift
from the emperor? -Yes.

38:13.990 --> 38:17.074
-Supposedly.
-Yeah, supposedly.

38:17.160 --> 38:20.828
If it is real, does it
authenticate any one theory?

38:20.913 --> 38:22.964
It doesn't, really,
because we don't think...

38:22.999 --> 38:26.000
it sounds like we don't really
think the Romans were here.

38:26.085 --> 38:28.002
Which means that
somebody else had it.

38:28.087 --> 38:31.138
-Wait a minute...
Yeah, why not?

38:31.174 --> 38:33.007
Look, we've had
the Phoenicians here,

38:33.092 --> 38:35.376
we've had the, uh,
the Templars here.

38:35.478 --> 38:37.144
Let's just put them...
put 'em on the list.

38:37.230 --> 38:39.146
All right. Romans, too.

38:39.232 --> 38:41.983
Romans, too. I love it. Let's
put... I'd love it to be Roman.

38:42.068 --> 38:43.934
Although there has, to date,

38:44.020 --> 38:46.070
never been
any credible evidence

38:46.189 --> 38:48.990
linking ancient Romans
to North America,

38:49.075 --> 38:52.193
over the years,
a number of ancient coins,

38:52.295 --> 38:55.162
dating as far back as 200 AD,

38:55.264 --> 38:58.699
have reportedly been discovered
in Nova Scotia

38:58.801 --> 39:01.919
just a few hundred miles
north of Oak Island.

39:02.038 --> 39:05.172
It has also long been theorized
that the intricate system

39:05.258 --> 39:07.258
of underwater booby traps

39:07.377 --> 39:10.961
and the man-made box drains
discovered at Smith's Cove

39:11.047 --> 39:13.297
reveal a sophisticated
knowledge

39:13.383 --> 39:15.116
of water displacement,

39:15.184 --> 39:18.352
similar in engineering to that
used by the ancient Romans

39:18.438 --> 39:21.422
in the building
of their famous aqueducts.

39:21.524 --> 39:23.391
Is it possible
that the flood system

39:23.443 --> 39:26.560
believed to be on Oak Island
was not simply

39:26.612 --> 39:28.595
inspired by the ancient Romans

39:28.698 --> 39:32.133
but was actually built by them?

39:32.235 --> 39:34.819
You know, I'm already thinking
the usual Oak Island what if's.

39:34.904 --> 39:37.104
What do you think, Alex
what's it mean?

39:37.156 --> 39:39.490
I don't know what it means.
It depends, like you said

39:39.575 --> 39:42.326
if it's... if it is
what we think it is

39:42.412 --> 39:45.463
it's original
it depends how it got here.

39:45.548 --> 39:48.049
 I mean, we do know
pirates operated all along here

39:48.134 --> 39:50.000
from the coast of Brazil
to Newfoundland.

39:50.086 --> 39:52.520
I mean, it could have been
stolen off another ship.

39:52.588 --> 39:54.588
It doesn't necessarily mean
that the Romans were here

39:54.674 --> 39:56.223
or the Templars were here,
the Visigoths,

39:56.309 --> 39:57.558
or anybody else was here.

39:57.643 --> 39:59.393
You're gonna get this
analyzed, right?

39:59.479 --> 40:02.346
Yes. We've found an expert
in, uh, Roman antiquities

40:02.432 --> 40:04.398
uh, Dr. Myles McCallum

40:04.484 --> 40:06.434
at St. Mary's University,

40:06.519 --> 40:09.653
and, uh, we're lining up
a meeting to bring this to him

40:09.772 --> 40:12.773
and have him look at it and see
if he thinks it's real or not.

40:14.694 --> 40:17.027
Well, hey, look, if it's real
and, probably more importantly,

40:17.113 --> 40:18.979
if it can be really documented
that it was found here,

40:19.082 --> 40:21.582
this is potentially
a huge game changer

40:21.667 --> 40:23.534
for what happened around here.

40:23.619 --> 40:25.619
I mean, I'll give it to you,
Rick, that's weird.

40:27.757 --> 40:30.341
It's really weird. I never...
You know, I like it, I love it.

40:30.426 --> 40:34.128
-It's pretty cool, ain't it?
-Romans were here, perhaps.

40:34.213 --> 40:37.732
After a week that has
taken the Oak Island team

40:37.800 --> 40:40.501
from the emotional highs
of anticipation

40:40.603 --> 40:42.052
and possible discovery

40:42.138 --> 40:44.171
to the lows of disappointment

40:44.223 --> 40:46.223
and bitter setback,

40:46.309 --> 40:48.392
Rick, Marty and their partners

40:48.478 --> 40:51.678
may have finally just been
handed the breakthrough

40:51.781 --> 40:53.647
they have been
hoping for all year.

40:53.733 --> 40:57.201
But will the discovery
of an ancient Roman sword

40:57.320 --> 41:01.122
retrieved from the waters
off the coast of Oak Island

41:01.207 --> 41:04.992
help the team solve
this centuries-old mystery

41:05.044 --> 41:06.527
once and for all?

41:06.596 --> 41:09.997
One fact is certain:

41:10.049 --> 41:12.500
In their determination
to uncover the history

41:12.585 --> 41:15.703
of Oak Island,
Rick and Marty Lagina

41:15.772 --> 41:18.506
have made history themselves.

41:18.574 --> 41:20.608
And whether the final chapters

41:20.676 --> 41:23.677
will be written in ink or blood

41:23.780 --> 41:26.397
is up to the island to decide.

41:29.485 --> 41:32.353
Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:32.421 --> 41:34.888
There's your artifact.
We did some tests on it.

41:34.941 --> 41:37.241
I think it has an interesting
story to tell.

41:37.326 --> 41:38.943
We're gonna try one more diver

41:39.028 --> 41:40.995
and if he can't do it,
we're done with divers.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.164
I'm telling you
it's zero visibility.

41:43.199 --> 41:44.748
We will get to the bottom.

41:44.867 --> 41:47.034
This is Laverne's model.

41:47.119 --> 41:48.335
Where he thinks the money is

41:48.371 --> 41:50.004
is right here.

41:50.089 --> 41:52.173
You put an X,
we'll punch a hole.

41:52.208 --> 41:55.075
Let's get steel down hole
and figure this thing out.

41:55.178 --> 41:57.144
I hit something.
- Hunk of wood.
