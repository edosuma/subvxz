My name is Earl.

[ Earl Narrating ]
When you're in prison,
nobody trusts you...

00:10.544 --> 00:13.614
to do the simplest things
you used to take for granted.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.887
I don't understand why they're
so touchy about us having
our own nail clippers.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.922
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah, seems kind of silly.

00:21.989 --> 00:25.025
But last year an inmate
used a pair to cut off
another guy's arm.

00:25.093 --> 00:28.729
Took a week and a half.
Big lawsuit.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.666
Oh, I forgot. I'm supposed
to take you to the warden.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.502
The warden?
Yeah.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.071
I got so caught up
watching you cut your nails,
I lost track of time.

00:37.138 --> 00:41.275
Hey, do you mind if I tell 'em
we're late 'cause you
resisted a little?

00:41.342 --> 00:44.212
I guess not.
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

00:44.278 --> 00:47.948
[ Shouts, Groans ]
Gotta make it believable.

00:48.015 --> 00:52.220
[ Groaning ]
No, no, no. Don't rub it.
It only makes it worse.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.555
[ Earl Narrating ]
It hurt to get Maced
in the eyes,

00:54.622 --> 00:57.525
but Randy missed me so much,
he felt like he'd been Maced
in the heart.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.128
So, hopin' to join me
in prison, he stole a car.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.065
Oh, my God!
I'm stealin' a car!

01:05.133 --> 01:09.303
I'm stealin' a car!
Come and get me!

01:09.370 --> 01:12.540
[ Earl Narrating ]
Then he waited
to get arrested.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.408
And waited.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.412
[ Sniffs ]

01:28.389 --> 01:30.424
[ Earl Narrating ]
And waited.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.561
And after three days,
he gave up.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.732
Then Randy had another
not-so-good idea.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.803
Excuse me, Officer.
What's the name
of that killer...

01:42.870 --> 01:45.139
that's killin'
all the people
at truck stops?

01:45.206 --> 01:49.109
The Truck Stop Killer.
Oh, yeah. That's me.

01:49.177 --> 01:52.213
We already caught
that guy.
Oh.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.848
See that graffiti over there?
I did that.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.950
Really?

01:57.017 --> 02:00.454
Hey, that's nice work. My wife's
been looking for somebody to do
a mural in the baby's room.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.490
Would you do it
for 50 bucks?

02:04.258 --> 02:05.759
[ Door Buzzes ]

02:05.826 --> 02:08.896
Randy, they're not gonna
send you to prison
for slappin' a cop.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.366
Even if they did, you know
the odds you'd be sent
to the same place as Earl?

02:12.433 --> 02:15.436
- Seven.
- Seven what?

02:15.503 --> 02:17.571
Seven going to prisons.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.073
- That don't even make sense.
- Twelve?

02:20.140 --> 02:23.377
I'm gonna bail you out
because I promised Earl
I'd take care of you,

02:23.444 --> 02:25.979
and I'm a woman of integrity.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.916
Just be thankful
your brother's in prison
for a felony I committed.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.988
My uncle once slapped a cop.
He got 12 years
in a penitentiary.

02:35.055 --> 02:38.359
- Guess what color he was.
- Lucky.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.528
Oh, wait.
That's not a color.

02:40.594 --> 02:44.565
[ Earl Narrating ] As warden,
Jerry Hazelwood was responsible
for overseeing the prisoners.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.134
Thing was, he didn't like
seeing prisoners.

02:47.201 --> 02:50.971
Uh, you wanted to see me,
Warden?

02:51.038 --> 02:54.675
Sir? Sir Warden?

02:54.742 --> 02:56.577
Well, hey.

02:56.644 --> 03:00.681
Nice work on, uh, helping
that Camden Scout fella make
his parole a couple of days ago.

03:00.748 --> 03:06.854
As a reward, I would like to
give you a certificate for one
week off your prison sentence,

03:06.920 --> 03:10.391
and a coupon for a 20% discount
at the prison store.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.294
Wow. A week off my sentence.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.963
Plus, I like
those coffee mugs they sell,

03:16.029 --> 03:18.299
and I always thought
they were about 20% too much.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.134
Well, you were a big help.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.637
Lord knows I need
all the help I can get.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.707
Don't tell anyone,
but this being a prison warden,
it's hard.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.909
[ Earl Narrating ]
The warden used to have
a pretty sweet life.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.312
Then his wife became governor
and ruined all his fun.

03:31.379 --> 03:35.115
[ Woman ] Jerry and I
are honored to be living
in the governor's mansion...

03:35.182 --> 03:39.219
and to be a part of
its distinguished history.
[ Gasps ]

03:39.287 --> 03:43.357
- Oh, Jerry.
- What? I have underwear on.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.226
[ Earl Narrating ]
And so the governor decided
to get Jerry a job.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.462
Unfortunately, the first job
didn't work out.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.764
Training? These guys
don't need training.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.834
We're the National Guard.
We're never gonna fight
in a war.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.070
[ Earl Narrating ]
So his wife made him a warden,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.239
but he just kept
making mistakes.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.642
Like letting a company
hire prison labor
to make something...

04:01.709 --> 04:04.845
that probably shouldn't
be made inside a prison.

04:08.282 --> 04:12.052
And there was his mandatory
"Bring Your Daughter
to Work Day."

04:12.119 --> 04:15.022
[ Screaming ]

04:16.189 --> 04:18.025
And I bet with
that ladder incident,

04:18.091 --> 04:21.329
nobody talks about
the 740 inmates
that didn't escape.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.631
Oh. I like that.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.699
You're a prison half-full
kind of guy.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.936
Anyway, I've got this problem
with these two gangs.

04:29.002 --> 04:33.073
It's kind of
an ebony-ivory sort of thing.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.977
Only the ivory is
a Spanish gang,
so it's ebony-Spanish.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.613
[ Earl Narrating ]
The gangs the warden
was talking about...

04:39.680 --> 04:41.582
had one thing in common--
they hated each other.

04:41.649 --> 04:45.919
So the warden tried to keep
the peace by taking the leader
of the Latin gang, Hector,

04:45.986 --> 04:47.955
and the leader of
the black gang, Jamal,

04:48.021 --> 04:50.891
and locking 'em in solitary
together for a month.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.328
The warden was a big fan of
that TV show The Odd Couple...

04:54.395 --> 04:58.332
and thought if it didn't
work out, at least
there'd be some laughs.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.501
What's up?
[ Grunting ]

05:04.572 --> 05:07.441
All right.
Open it up.

05:07.508 --> 05:11.412
[ Earl Narrating ] Sure enough,
after a month together, they
hated each other more than ever.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.414
The gang violence continued.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.685
You get these two gangs
to stop fighting, I'm gonna
give you another certificate.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.522

off your sentence.

a little word of advice.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.998
These fellas can smell fear.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.266
You gotta let 'em know
who's boss from jump street.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.538
You gotta stand taller
than they do, you gotta
speak louder than they do.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.407
You gotta be tougher
than they are. You gotta--

[ Shouting ]

05:47.548 --> 05:49.783

The warden was gonna give me
another certificate...

05:49.850 --> 05:52.820
for time off my sentence
if I could stop the gangs
from fightin'.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.956
First thing I had to do was
figure out what started it.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.908
* [ Man ] You shake my nerves
and you rattle my brain *

And so I convinced the warden
to get another ball.

That way both gangs could play
and everyone would be happy.

thought Randy was my husband.

Darnell was my driver.

about. He's making me crazy.

I want to be honest.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.256
I'm sick of livin'
in the shadows.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.693
Puss, we've talked
about this. My gang
will never accept you.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.863
So what? I'm not
good enough for them?

12:09.930 --> 12:12.833
You're just not
the right color,
Jamal.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.635
Plus the gay thing--
They'll think it's icky.

12:15.702 --> 12:20.007
Well, I need more from you
than just an occasional
punch in the throat.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.909
If I can't have that,
then I don't want anything.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.911
Jamal--
Don't.

12:26.546 --> 12:30.050
But y-you-you guys aren't
gonna fight anymore, right?
[ Door Closes ]

12:30.117 --> 12:32.619
[ Earl Narrating ]
Unfortunately,
Jamal felt scorned,

12:32.685 --> 12:34.988
and that meant
all-out war.

12:37.791 --> 12:41.428
Oh, man. I got
a spoon last time.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.531
Hopefully the guy
you're fightin' has soup.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.666
[ Laughs ]

12:46.733 --> 12:49.803
Now, just so we're clear,
you only get a month-off
certificate...

12:49.870 --> 12:52.272
if you increase the peace,
not decrease it.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.575
That I could've done
on my own.
Sir, I'm doin' my best.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.511
Well, your best has gotten me
an infirmary full of
stab wound victims,

12:58.578 --> 13:01.114
not to mention a guy
with a bucket stuck
on his head.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.350
They're not sure
that thing's ever
gonna come off, Earl.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.652
Yeah, they're already
callin' him Buckethead.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.855
Lookit,
I'll level with ya.

13:07.921 --> 13:11.558
I have a fraternity reunion
coming up, and if
I'm not employed,

13:11.624 --> 13:15.495
Slime Cracker and Man Boobs
are gonna tease
the crap out of me.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.566
I'll fix it.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.601
[ Earl Narrating ]
While things were getting worse
in prison,

13:21.668 --> 13:24.104
they were finally getting better
for Joy and Randy.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.140
Joy, I have a question,
and Darnell won't help me.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.809
It's a book, Randy.
I know.

13:29.877 --> 13:34.347
I figure the only way
I can be with Earl is to try
to become a prison guard.

13:34.414 --> 13:38.151
I think it's a dangerous job
for him. I mean, look
at his reaction time.

13:38.218 --> 13:41.521
Randy, I'm going
to slap you.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.161
- Ow.
- He's like a snake
in winter.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.898
Is this a full-time job
that'll get you
out of the house...

13:50.964 --> 13:54.667
so I don't have to stare at you
sittin' on my couch all day
like a uncooked biscuit?

13:54.734 --> 13:58.071
Yes, and part of
what you just said
hurt my feelings.

13:59.639 --> 14:03.610
I'm sorry, Randy.
Let me make up for it
by helping you study.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.446
We'll start slow.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.050
"True or false--
If I was held hostage,
I would sue the city."

14:11.484 --> 14:15.022
False?
That's right.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.760
[ Earl Narrating ]
If I was gonna fix
the gang problem,

14:20.827 --> 14:22.963
I needed to fix
the romance problem.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.865
I started by stealing
Jamal's sweaty shirt.

14:29.802 --> 14:34.607
Since Jamal was the one
feelin' scorned, I had to get
Hector to make the first move.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.319

[ Man On P.A. ]
Lights out.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.665
[ Earl Narrating ]
Next I talked to Homer,
who works in the prison laundry.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.635
Other than once killing
nine people on a party boat,
he's a real nice guy.

15:05.272 --> 15:10.243
* Don't look to
those above you *

15:10.310 --> 15:13.713

* But you're rock candy

While Hector was watching
Jamal lick his ice cream,

15:46.713 --> 15:50.050
Randy was hoping he could
lick his prison guard test.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.488
Then he waited
for the results.

Are you Randy Hickey?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.261
Tell me I didn't
get that one wrong.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.696
Mr. Hickey, you scored 55%.

16:03.763 --> 16:08.468
I think I'd like
to play the race card.
How do I do that?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.870
[ Earl Narrating ]
Randy might not have gotten
the results he wanted,

16:10.937 --> 16:13.906
but it looked like
I was starting to get
the results I wanted.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.010
I miss Jamal.
Go talk to him.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.980
Tell him you want him back,
and then your gangs
can stop fighting.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.283
[ Hector ]
Nah, I can't go over there.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.452

will kill me.

You tell him. I'll write down
what I want you to say.

16:30.023 --> 16:34.427
All right, but since
I have to read this,
nothin' too embarrassing.

"You're my pouty-lipped
he-slut,

16:38.165 --> 16:42.135

man candy."

16:42.202 --> 16:44.871
You know what? I'm gonna
just cut to the chase.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.208
Hector's sorry
and he wants you back.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.511
He broke my heart, Earl.
I could never trust him again.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.914
Tell him it's over,
and then kiss him hard for me.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.650
And squeeze his nipples.
He likes that.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.623
That's all he said--
it's over?
Yep.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.827
But that's no reason
to keep fightin'.
These things happen.

Sometimes people
just can't be together.
I can't live without him, Earl.

Well, there's times
we all have to live
without the people we love.

That-That's what sadness
is all about.

Would you want to live in
a world without sadness?

17:20.273 --> 17:24.010
Without sadness,
we wouldn't know joy or love,

17:24.077 --> 17:26.579
and love is what
makes life worth--

than live without Jamal.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.405
[ Electricity Crackling ]

17:52.472 --> 17:55.808
And seeing that made Jamal
realize that he couldn't live
without Hector either.

- So he tried to get him
off the fence.
- [ Cheering ]

just beating a sworn enemy
as he was being electrocuted,

which they thought was cool.

to let 'em use his office
