WEBVTT

01:55.365 --> 02:00.410
- So, what do you do?
- I'm studying to be an actress. You?

02:00.537 --> 02:04.331
- I'm a longshoreman.
- No, I mean, really.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.333
I mean really, too.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.501
Although, starting next Monday,

02:07.585 --> 02:09.294
I'm doing something
a little more glamorous.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.462
What's that?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.799
Night cashier at a cafeteria.

02:13.883 --> 02:18.720
I don't mean how you make money.
I mean, what are you interested in?

02:19.931 --> 02:22.266
Honey, if I had the answer to that one,

02:22.392 --> 02:25.477
I bet I'd bore us both to death
in half an hour.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.270
Thank God that's over.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.441
So much for the debut
of the Laurel Players.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.777
And she was very disappointing.

03:23.161 --> 03:27.372
- Frank! Very nice, Frank!
- Thanks so much, Mrs Givings.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.043
I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it.
You have a very talented wife.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.337
I'll pass it along.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.060
- Frank!
- Hi!

03:48.686 --> 03:51.730
She's in there.
I'm about ready for that drink.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.690
Couple of minutes.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.535
April? Sweetheart?

04:08.539 --> 04:09.957
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.793
- You about ready to leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.754
I've just got to get this makeup off.

04:22.637 --> 04:26.265
Well, I guess it wasn't a triumph
or anything, was it?

04:28.893 --> 04:34.731
- I guess not. I'll be ready in a minute.
- Take your time.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.611
Listen, will you do me a favour?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.656
Milly and Shep wanted us
to go out with them after.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.243
Will you say we can't? Say it's because
of the babysitter or something.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.287
Well, the thing is,
I already said that we could.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.372
I mean, I just saw them
and I said that we would.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.582
Then would you mind going out again
and saying you were mistaken?

04:52.667 --> 04:53.792
That should be simple enough.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.669
Don't you think
that's a little bit rude, April?

04:55.753 --> 04:58.588
- Then I'll tell them myself.
- Okay. Okay. Take it easy.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.757
All right? I'll tell them.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.677
I mean it, baby.
You were the only person in that play.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.262
Thank you.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.809
We shouldn't have let you get
mixed up in the damned thing, is all.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.311
All right.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.690
What a bunch of amateurs. I mean,
you've studied, for Christ's sake.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.150
Could we stop talking about it now?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.276
Sure.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.739
I just don't want you
feeling bad about it, that's all.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.908
Because it's not worth it, you know.

06:07.992 --> 06:11.620
It's bad enough having to live out
here amongst these people...

06:11.704 --> 06:13.914
- What'd you say?
- I said yes. All right, Frank.

06:13.998 --> 06:19.044
Could you just stop talking about it now
before you drive me crazy, please?

06:23.299 --> 06:25.008
What are you doing?

06:33.976 --> 06:37.312
April, sweetheart,
let's talk about this, okay?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.148
- No, Frank, please don't do that.
- Come on, now.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.150
- Don't touch me.
- April. April...

06:42.235 --> 06:44.778
Just leave me alone.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.245
Okay. Okay.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.417
It strikes me that there's a considerable
amount of bullshit going on here.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.586
And there's just a few things
that I'd like to clear up. All right?

07:01.671 --> 07:06.299
Number one, it's not my fault
that the play was lousy. Okay?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.677
Number two,
it sure as hell isn't my fault

07:08.761 --> 07:11.138
that you didn't turn out to be an actress,

07:11.222 --> 07:13.557
and the sooner you get over
that little piece of soap opera,

07:13.641 --> 07:14.850
the better off we're both going to be.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.644
Number three,
I don't happen to fit the role

07:17.728 --> 07:20.647
of dumb, insensitive suburban husband.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.775
You've been trying to lay that crap
on me ever since we moved out here.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.152
And I'm damned if I'll wear it.

07:25.236 --> 07:30.240
Number four... April? April!

07:32.368 --> 07:33.535
April.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.163
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in the car.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.958
No. I will in a minute.
Just let me stand here for a second.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.668
God damn it!

07:45.047 --> 07:48.842
April, can you please just get back
in the car and talk about this

07:48.926 --> 07:50.385
instead of running all over Route 12?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.096
Haven't I made it clear I don't
particularly want to talk about it?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.973
Okay. I mean, Jesus,
I'm trying to be nice

07:55.057 --> 07:57.058
about this thing here, for God's sake.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.228
How kind of you.
How terribly, terribly kind of you.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.813
Wait a minute. I don't deserve this.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.523
You're always so wonderfully definite

08:03.608 --> 08:05.317
on the subject of what you do
and don't deserve.

08:05.401 --> 08:09.946
Wait a minute! Wait a goddamn... April!
Now you listen to me.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.990
This is one time
you're not going to get away

08:12.074 --> 08:14.159
with twisting everything that I say, April.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.411
This just happens to be
one goddamn time

08:16.496 --> 08:18.205
I know I'm not in the wrong here.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.789
Christ, I wish
you'd stayed home tonight.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.166
You know what you are
when you're like this, April?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.667
You're sick. I really mean that.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.128
- You're sick! What?
- And do you know what you are?

08:25.213 --> 08:26.546
- You're disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

08:26.631 --> 08:27.923
You don't fool me, Frank.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.091
Just because you've got me safely
in this little trap,

08:30.176 --> 08:32.677
you think you can bully me into feeling
whatever you want me to feel!

08:32.762 --> 08:35.305
- You in a trap? You in a trap?
- Yes! Yes! Me, Frank!

08:35.389 --> 08:38.308
- Jesus Christ, don't make me laugh!
- Me!

08:38.392 --> 08:41.895
You pathetic, self-deluded little boy.
Look at you!

08:41.979 --> 08:45.565
Look at you and tell me, how by any
stretch of the imagination

08:45.650 --> 08:47.817
you can call yourself a man?

08:50.530 --> 08:51.696
Damn it!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.074
Jesus Christ!

09:09.840 --> 09:14.844
- Don't look at me like that, April.
- Could we please go home now?

11:20.346 --> 11:21.930
Fifteenth floor.

11:33.984 --> 11:38.363
I'm going to need your help
this morning, Old Scout.

11:38.447 --> 11:42.951
For the next few hours, you're to warn
me of Bandy's every approach

11:43.077 --> 11:45.203
and you may need to shield me
from public view

11:45.287 --> 11:48.915
in the likely event I void my stomach.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.500
It's that bad.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.627
Good morning, Jack.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.004
Nothing good about it, I assure you.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.070
Of course, I knew the moment
you stepped off the train

12:19.155 --> 12:20.155
what you were looking for.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.159
A small remodelled barn,
or a carriage house.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.119
And I just hate to be
the one to tell you that sort of thing

12:26.203 --> 12:28.747
just isn't available any more.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.374
But I don't want you to despair.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.044
There is one place up here
I want to show you.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.215
Now, of course, it isn't very desirable
at this end.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.886
As you can see, Crawford Road
is mostly these little cinder-blocky,

12:42.970 --> 12:45.972
pick-up trucky places,
plumbers, carpenters,

12:46.056 --> 12:48.183
little local people of that sort.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.768
But eventually...

12:49.852 --> 12:54.230
Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary
Road, which is much nicer.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.566
Now, the place I want to show you

12:56.650 --> 13:00.195
is a sweet little house
and a sweet little setting.

13:00.279 --> 13:05.074
Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
marvellous for children.

13:05.159 --> 13:07.577
It's just around this next curve.

13:08.245 --> 13:14.709
Now, you'll see it. There.
See the little white one? Sweet, isn't it?

13:15.294 --> 13:20.632
The perky way it sits there on
its little slope? Charming, isn't it?

13:23.177 --> 13:24.385
Oh, yes.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.940
You wanted to see me?

13:37.024 --> 13:40.318
Came for you from Toledo this morning.
This is the third one this month.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.153
Sorry. I thought I'd taken care of...

13:42.238 --> 13:44.239
I'm not prepared to have this
conversation again, Frank.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.366
- You understand?
- I was literally just getting into...

13:46.450 --> 13:49.828
These folks in the provinces look up
to us. We need to be efficient.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.622
We can't have this
kind of back and forth, and so forth.

13:52.706 --> 13:57.502
- It's just not efficient. Am I right?
- Yes.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.840
- What was that about?
- Toledo.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.425
Branch manager wants
a revised brochure

14:04.510 --> 14:07.345
for the conference on the Knox 500.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.598
"It's just not efficient. Am I right?
Am I right? Am I right?"

14:11.350 --> 14:12.934
Sounds like a goodie.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.437
For God's sake. I don't even know what
the Knox 500 does. Do you?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.273
Don't insult me.

14:32.121 --> 14:37.709
If you'll look in the inactive file
under SP 1109,

14:37.793 --> 14:41.087
you'll find copies of all the stuff we sent
to the agency,

14:41.171 --> 14:46.593
that way we can trace the thing back
to its original sources.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.141
Listen, I hope you weren't planning
on having an early lunch.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.769
No. I'm not really hungry.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.188
Good. I'll check on you later then.
All right?

14:59.273 --> 15:00.732
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.822
You know something, Maureen?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.159
You're lucky you met me.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.912
How's that?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.458
I think I can show you the ropes,
you know.

15:18.542 --> 15:24.255
There's a certain art to survival at Knox.
Really. Let me show you what I mean.

15:24.965 --> 15:29.969
Waiter. Bring me the telephone,
would you? And two more martinis.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.013
Wow.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.357
Klondike 5-55-66, please.

15:44.568 --> 15:47.612
Hello, Mrs Jorgensen?
Frank Wheeler here. Yes.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.823
I just wanted to let you know
that I've had to send Maureen Grube

15:50.908 --> 15:53.117
down to Visual Aids for me.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.746
I'll probably need her
the rest of the afternoon. Yes.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.166
You, too. Take care now.

16:04.546 --> 16:11.427
- I never even heard of Visual Aids.
- That's because it doesn't exist.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.326
Hi, Helen. Come on in.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.286
I can't stay a minute.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.248
I just wanted to bring
these sedum plantings

16:40.332 --> 16:43.418
for that messy patch
down by the foot of the drive.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.294
It's like the European houseleek,

16:45.379 --> 16:49.007
only these have the most marvellous
little yellow blossoms.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.217
Now, all it wants for the first few days

16:51.301 --> 16:54.971
is just a tiny dollop of water,
and then you'll find it absolutely thrives.

16:55.055 --> 16:58.057
Well, thank you, Helen.
That's so kind of you.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.977
Would you like some coffee?

17:12.448 --> 17:14.991
Is there something
I can do for you, Helen?

17:15.075 --> 17:17.452
I almost forgot.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.164
There is one small favour
I would like to ask.

17:21.248 --> 17:28.212
It's about... It's about my son, John.
He's been in the hospital.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.673
I'm sorry. Is everything all right?

17:30.758 --> 17:36.763
Well, actually, just for the time being,
he's in Pleasant Brook. Psychiatric.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.145
- Oh, I see.
- Well, it's nothing serious.

17:44.480 --> 17:49.817
He just got a little run down. Things can
just get the better of us sometimes.

17:49.902 --> 17:53.863
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Of course.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.240
It's a marvellous facility

17:56.325 --> 17:59.202
and the treatments
seem to be doing wonders for him.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.913
Anyway, they said getting him out
for an afternoon

18:01.997 --> 18:04.499
might do him a little bit of good.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.544
I think he finds my friends
a little conventional, quite frankly.

18:08.629 --> 18:13.883
I mean, he's travelled.
He has a Ph.D. In mathematics.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.845
I suppose you could say
he's an intellectual.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.767
It would do him a world of good
to meet a young couple like you.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.019
Well, we'd love to meet him.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.982
- Really?
- Yes.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.110
We'd love to.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.530
Thank you, dear.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.408
Thank you.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.956
Well, I must be off.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.011
I remember the first day
you came off the train.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.557
You weren't like my other clients.
You were different.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.978
You just seemed special.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.734
Of course, you still are.

19:15.654 --> 19:20.199
Remember, just a dollop. I must scoot.
Toodle-oo.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.330
Bye.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.975
I think you got me a little drunk.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.818
You know what today is?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.153
Monday?

19:59.448 --> 20:04.410
It's my birthday. I'm 30 years old today.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.496
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

20:14.713 --> 20:19.008
What was the name of that department
you made up again?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.225
Visual Aids.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.394
What a joke.

20:33.982 --> 20:37.276
What a joke. Oh, my.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.990
- You want to hear a real joke?
- Yes.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.663
- My old man worked at Knox.
- Yeah?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.500
He was a salesman in Yonkers.

20:55.671 --> 21:00.049
Once a year he used to take me
into the city for lunch.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.970
It was supposed to be a very special,
life-advice sort of occasion.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.056
- Nice.
- No. Not really.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.519
I used to sit there and think,

21:13.939 --> 21:16.857
"I hope to Christ I don't end up like you."

21:20.529 --> 21:25.199
Now, here I am,
a 30-year-old Knox man.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.453
Can you beat that?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.749
I think I kind of lost you...

21:37.045 --> 21:39.213
Your father worked for Knox?

21:39.298 --> 21:45.720
I'm sorry, everything's just kind of
going out of focus.

21:52.102 --> 21:56.814
Why don't we get some air,
you and me?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.521
Is this you?

22:39.691 --> 22:40.858
Yeah.

22:40.942 --> 22:44.820
- You been to Paris?
- I've never really been anywhere.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.032
Maybe I'll take you with me then.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.951
I'm going back the first chance I get,
I tell you.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.662
People are alive there. Not like here.

23:01.797 --> 23:06.133
All I know, April, is I want to feel things.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.305
Really feel them, you know.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.559
How's that for an ambition?

23:17.312 --> 23:24.151
Frank Wheeler? I think you're the most
interesting person I've ever met.

23:31.493 --> 23:36.163
I guess this wasn't what you had in mind
when you went to work this morning?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.457
No. It certainly wasn't.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.020
Do you have a cigarette, Frank?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.023
Yeah, sure.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.491
There you go.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.288
Can I get you a drink or anything?

24:17.706 --> 24:20.124
No thanks, Maureen. Actually, it's...

24:20.208 --> 24:24.211
It's getting kind of late.
I guess I'd better be cutting out.

24:25.046 --> 24:30.426
Gee, that's right.
Did you miss your train?

24:30.510 --> 24:33.262
That's all right, I'll catch the next one.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.391
Listen, you were swell.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.400
Take care now.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.812
- Frank.
- Why are you all dressed up?

25:24.439 --> 25:28.317
First of all, I missed you all day
and I want to say I'm sorry.

25:29.027 --> 25:32.112
I'm sorry for the way I've been
since the play.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.866
I'm sorry for everything, and I love you.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.954
The rest can wait.

25:40.038 --> 25:45.876
Now, you just wait here
till I call you. Okay?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.461
Okay.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.765
All right, Frank. You can come in now.

26:14.072 --> 26:20.661
Happy birthday to you

26:20.745 --> 26:25.124
Happy birthday, dear Daddy

26:25.208 --> 26:29.128
Happy birthday to you

26:31.506 --> 26:33.507
Happy birthday, darling.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.552
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.445
Frank.

27:01.536 --> 27:05.331
Frank. I have had
the most wonderful idea.

27:06.708 --> 27:10.294
- I've been thinking about it all day.
- Baby, what's all this about?

27:10.378 --> 27:12.421
Do you know how much money
we have saved?

27:12.547 --> 27:15.716
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.969
And with the money we could get from
the house and the car, longer than that.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.929
"What we could get for the house"?

27:21.056 --> 27:24.516
Sweetheart, what are you talking about?
Where are we going to live?

27:25.852 --> 27:27.019
Paris.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.146
What?

27:29.230 --> 27:31.398
You always said it was the only place
you'd ever been

27:31.483 --> 27:35.152
that you wanted to go back to,
the only place that was worth living.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.820
So why don't we go there?

27:36.905 --> 27:41.200
- You're serious?
- Yes. What's stopping us?

27:41.743 --> 27:45.204
What's stopping us? Well, I can think
of a number of different things.

27:45.288 --> 27:49.041
For example, what kind of a job
could I possibly get?

27:49.125 --> 27:53.587
You won't be getting any
kind of a job, because I will.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.506
Oh, right, right.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.966
Don't laugh at me. Listen a minute.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.886
Do you know what they pay
for secretarial positions

28:00.970 --> 28:03.055
- in government agencies in Europe?
- No, I don't.

28:03.139 --> 28:06.225
Listen, Frank, I'm serious about this.
Do you think I'm kidding or something?

28:06.309 --> 28:08.852
Okay, okay.
I just have a couple of questions, is all.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.647
For one thing, what exactly
am I supposed to be doing

28:11.731 --> 28:14.024
while you're out earning all this money?

28:14.109 --> 28:17.986
Don't you see? That's the whole idea.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.740
You'll be doing what you should've
been allowed to do seven years ago.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.575
You'll have time.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.869
For the first time in your life
you'll have time to find out

28:25.954 --> 28:28.205
what it is that you actually want to do.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.707
And when you figure it out,

28:29.791 --> 28:33.252
you'll have the time and the freedom
to start doing it.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.717
Sweetheart, it's just
not very realistic, is all.

28:44.013 --> 28:47.975
No, Frank. This is what's unrealistic.

28:48.977 --> 28:52.646
It's unrealistic for a man
with a fine mind to go on working

28:52.772 --> 28:55.399
year after year at a job he can't stand,

28:55.483 --> 28:57.276
coming home to a place he can't stand,

28:57.360 --> 29:01.447
to a wife who's equally unable to stand
the same things.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.825
Do you want to know the worst part?

29:05.827 --> 29:09.288
Our whole existence here
is based on this great premise

29:09.372 --> 29:13.625
that we're special and superior
to the whole thing.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.502
But we're not.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.213
We're just like everyone else.

29:18.298 --> 29:22.176
Look at us. We've bought into
the same ridiculous delusion.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.470
This idea that
you have to resign from life

29:24.554 --> 29:27.514
and settle down the moment
you have children.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.435
And we've been
punishing each other for it.

29:31.519 --> 29:34.563
Listen, we decided to move out here.

29:34.689 --> 29:36.607
No one forced me
to take the job at Knox.

29:36.691 --> 29:39.485
I mean, whoever said I was meant
to be a big deal, anyway?

29:39.569 --> 29:43.739
When I first met you, there was nothing
in the world you couldn't do or be.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.657
When you first met me
I was a little wise guy

29:45.742 --> 29:46.784
with a big mouth, that's all.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.912
You were not.
How can you even say that?

29:52.165 --> 29:56.043
Okay. Okay, so I'll have time.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.755
And God knows that's appealing.
It's very appealing.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.132
And everything you're saying
makes sense

30:02.217 --> 30:05.302
if I had a definite talent,
if I were a writer or an artist.

30:05.386 --> 30:08.013
No. But, Frank, listen. Listen to me.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.933
It's what you are that's being stifled.

30:11.017 --> 30:15.437
It's what you are that's being denied
and denied in this kind of life.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.566
And what's that?

30:22.403 --> 30:24.029
Don't you know?

30:26.449 --> 30:30.244
You're the most beautiful
and wonderful thing in the world.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.874
You're a man.

30:54.727 --> 31:00.524
This is our chance, Frank.
This is our one chance.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.489
Okay.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.619
Okay?

31:14.998 --> 31:18.417
Why not? Why the hell not?

31:42.025 --> 31:44.693
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Frank.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.987
Franklin. Good to see your shining face.

31:47.071 --> 31:51.992
- What's the news?
- Fellas, I'm moving to Paris.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.622
Indeed. And I'm moving to Tangiers.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.934
Intra-company letter to Toledo.

32:17.018 --> 32:21.688
Attention B.F. Chalmers,
Branch Manager.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.485
With regard to recent and repeated
correspondence,

32:26.569 --> 32:29.279
this is to advise
that the matter has been

32:29.364 --> 32:32.532
very satisfactorily taken in hand, period.

32:32.617 --> 32:37.913
Paragraph. We wholly agree that
the existing brochure is unsuitable.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.541
To this end, we have developed, quote,

32:47.382 --> 32:50.217
"Speaking of Production Control."

32:59.560 --> 33:04.231
Here you go, Mrs Wheeler. These are
the traveller's cheques you requested.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.858
- Yes.
- Your steamer reservations.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.862
These I'll pass on
to the embassy for you.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.823
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.038
September. October at the outside.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.667
I just happen to think
people are better off

33:23.751 --> 33:26.294
doing some kind of work
they actually like.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.381
- Right. Right, yes.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

33:29.465 --> 33:34.970
But, I mean, assuming there is
this true vocation waiting for you,

33:35.304 --> 33:39.182
wouldn't you be just as likely
to discover it here as there?

33:41.060 --> 33:43.520
I don't think it's possible
to discover anything

33:43.604 --> 33:46.982
on the 15th floor of the Knox building,

33:47.066 --> 33:49.735
and I don't think any of you do either.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.921
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

34:53.007 --> 34:55.342
- Michael.
- Daddy, will you read us...

34:55.885 --> 35:00.972
...all the way to here.

35:01.599 --> 35:05.018
We have to take a big boat ride
across the sea to get there.

35:05.103 --> 35:09.564
- But I won't know anybody there.
- I know. I know. Neither will I.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.609
But remember how you felt
when you started school?

35:12.693 --> 35:15.320
And now look
how many friends you have.

35:15.404 --> 35:19.074
You'll never guess
what they eat in Paris.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.451
- You'll never guess.
- What?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.621
- Slimy snails.
- Snails?

35:24.705 --> 35:27.707
Slimy snails and icky frog's legs.

35:40.263 --> 35:43.056
Milly, where are you, doll?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.935
You better get changed,
they'll be here soon.

35:47.937 --> 35:51.106
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Don't you like it?

35:51.691 --> 35:54.985
Yeah, yeah. You look great, doll.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.446
Guess I better haul ass.

36:15.131 --> 36:16.506
Hiya, gang.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.513
What you watching?

37:03.054 --> 37:04.137
Shep?

37:06.515 --> 37:08.975
I was calling you and calling you.

37:11.979 --> 37:12.979
Hi.

37:19.445 --> 37:22.822
Here we go. Just a little something.

37:24.367 --> 37:30.205
- Those look great. I'm starving.
- April, I can't get over it,

37:30.915 --> 37:33.875
you look like the cat that ate the canary.

37:34.001 --> 37:38.338
Do you have something to tell us?
Just a little bit of news?

37:38.547 --> 37:42.676
Well, actually, Milly, we... Well, we do
have some important news, yes.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.135
I knew it.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.597
Honey, why don't you tell them?
Go ahead.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.852
We're going to Europe. To Paris.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.025
To live.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.990
- What?
- When?

38:05.074 --> 38:08.535
- In September.
- But what for?

38:10.079 --> 38:14.666
What for?
Well, because we've always wanted to.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.627
Because the kids are young enough.
Because it's beautiful.

38:17.712 --> 38:21.006
I mean, really.
Shep, you've been there, you tell her.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.383
- Yeah, it's a great city.
- Yeah.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.101
When did you make this decision?

38:34.854 --> 38:37.355
About a week ago?
It's hard to remember.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.482
We just suddenly decided to go,
that's all.

38:39.567 --> 38:43.737
- About a week ago, you tell us now.
- We had to get used to the idea.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.823
So, what's the deal, Frank?
You get a job over there, or what?

38:46.907 --> 38:51.036
- No, no. Not exactly.
- What do you mean, "Not exactly"?

38:53.331 --> 38:57.083
Frank won't be getting
any kind of a job, because I will.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.630
So what are you going to do, Frank?

39:02.715 --> 39:05.967
I'm going to study.
And I'm going to read.

39:06.719 --> 39:11.014
I suppose I'm going to finally figure out
what I want to do with my life, Shep.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.016
While she supports you?

39:14.226 --> 39:16.394
Yes. While she supports me.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.272
In the beginning.

39:19.565 --> 39:22.359
You wouldn't believe what they pay
for secretarial work

39:22.443 --> 39:24.361
in those government agencies
over there.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.113
NATO and ECA and those places.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.908
And the cost of living
is dirt cheap, right?

39:29.992 --> 39:31.534
It's so cheap.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.414
The truth is we just need
something different.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.210
We're not getting any younger and
we don't want life to just pass us by.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.795
That's right.

39:42.046 --> 39:45.507
Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.636
I mean it. It really sounds wonderful.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.888
- Thank you, Milly.
- Oh, Milly.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.517
We'll certainly miss you both.
Won't we, sweetie? Golly.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.310
- Sure.
- We'll miss you, too.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.436
- Of course.
- Truly.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.605
We should have a toast or something.
To Paris.

40:00.689 --> 40:01.940
- To Paris.
- To Paris.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.274
To Paris.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.444
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.793
You know what I think?

40:22.545 --> 40:23.670
What?

40:24.046 --> 40:27.298
I think this whole plan
sounds a little immature.

40:27.466 --> 40:30.093
Oh, God, I am so relieved.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.098
Me, too.
I was thinking that the whole time.

40:35.182 --> 40:36.724
I mean, what kind of man
is going to sit around

40:36.809 --> 40:38.601
in his bathrobe all day picking his nose

40:38.686 --> 40:41.146
- while his wife goes out and works?
- I don't know, Shep.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.939
I just don't know.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.239
Why are you crying?

40:53.617 --> 40:55.326
What's the matter?

40:59.665 --> 41:03.168
It's nothing. I'm just so relieved.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.296
Shep.

41:06.380 --> 41:12.802
Don't cry. Please. It's all right.
Everything's going to be all right.

41:15.222 --> 41:20.310
My God, their faces! Oh, God.

41:21.812 --> 41:22.979
Oh, God!

41:23.814 --> 41:26.691
You know what this is like,
April, honestly?

41:27.651 --> 41:28.735
Just talking like this?

41:28.819 --> 41:32.572
The whole idea of going off
to Europe this way?

41:32.740 --> 41:36.701
This is the way I felt going up to the line
the first time, in the war.

41:36.785 --> 41:39.662
I mean, I was probably
just as scared as everyone else,

41:39.747 --> 41:43.166
but inside I never felt better.

41:43.250 --> 41:47.253
I felt alive. I felt full of blood. I felt...

41:48.464 --> 41:50.798
Everything just...
Everything seemed more real.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.592
The guys in their uniforms.

41:52.676 --> 41:57.388
The snow on the fields, the trees.
And all of us just walking.

41:58.432 --> 42:01.184
I mean, I was scared, of course.

42:01.268 --> 42:06.231
But I just kept thinking,
"This is it, you know. This is the truth."

42:10.319 --> 42:12.362
I felt that way once, too.

42:13.781 --> 42:14.948
When?

42:23.207 --> 42:25.750
The first time you made love to me.

42:29.630 --> 42:30.797
April.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.712
Frank.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.199
- What's up?
- Bart Pollock's here.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.368
He's in Bandy's office.

43:44.371 --> 43:45.872
Big deal, huh?

43:51.253 --> 43:53.755
Looks like he wants to talk to you.

43:56.383 --> 43:59.302
Hey, keep my name out of it.

44:05.809 --> 44:09.520
Frank. Good to see you.
You know Bart Pollock?

44:09.605 --> 44:13.733
- Well, we've never met, but of course...
- Good to know you, Frank.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.486
"Speaking of Production Control"?

44:19.573 --> 44:24.452
Frank, this is a crackerfack.

44:26.288 --> 44:29.415
They are tickled to death in Toledo.

44:37.091 --> 44:38.091
Really?

44:40.010 --> 44:44.347
So, this guy Pollock was perfect
presidential material in the worst sense.

44:44.431 --> 44:48.810
A million dollar smile and about three
pounds of muscle between the ears.

44:48.894 --> 44:51.020
April, you should have heard this guy.

44:51.105 --> 44:55.692
"Frank, this is a crackerfack."
What a horse's ass.

44:55.943 --> 44:59.529
Wish I'd seen his face
when you told him you were leaving.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.656
Yeah.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.039
Here they come.

45:13.168 --> 45:15.420
- Sorry to be late.
- You're not late.

45:15.504 --> 45:18.131
- The traffic was terrible.
- Thank you. You didn't have to do that.

45:18.215 --> 45:20.508
- Good to see you.
- Wasn't it terrible, Howard?

45:20.592 --> 45:21.718
Well, Route 12.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.636
By the time they finish
that stretch of road,

45:23.721 --> 45:26.681
they'll have to start all over again, right?

45:27.474 --> 45:31.185
- And you must be John?
- Say hello, John.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.814
Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.

45:36.650 --> 45:39.569
- Where are your darling children?
- They're at a birthday party?

45:39.653 --> 45:41.904
- Sorry they couldn't be here.
- Don't worry.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.323
If I had a certified lunatic
coming around my house,

45:44.408 --> 45:46.909
I'd probably get the kids
out of the way, too.

45:46.994 --> 45:51.330
Look at all this food. You didn't
have to go to any trouble for us.

45:51.415 --> 45:52.915
It's just some sandwiches.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.418
John, would you like a sandwich?

45:55.919 --> 45:59.297
Helen's been talking it up
about you people for months.

45:59.381 --> 46:02.133
The nice young Wheelers
on Revolutionary Road,

46:02.217 --> 46:05.845
the nice young Revolutionaries
on Wheeler Road.

46:06.972 --> 46:10.558
- Would anyone like some sherry?
- Please don't bother, Frank.

46:10.642 --> 46:11.934
I'd like some sherry.

46:12.019 --> 46:15.646
And I'll drink Helen's, too,
if she doesn't beat me to it.

46:17.149 --> 46:20.067
But, hey, you got a highball glass?

46:20.194 --> 46:24.197
Put a couple-three ice cubes in it,
pour it up to the brim.

46:24.698 --> 46:28.242
- That's the way I like it.
- I think I can handle that.

46:33.832 --> 46:37.668
This egg salad is delicious, April.
You must tell me how you fix it.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.797
- You a lawyer, Frank?
- No. No, I'm not.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.215
I could use a lawyer.

46:42.341 --> 46:45.009
John, let's not get started again
about the lawyer.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.135
Pop, couldn't you just sit there

46:46.220 --> 46:49.597
and eat your wonderful egg salad
and quit horning in?

46:50.516 --> 46:53.059
See, I've got a good
many questions to ask

46:53.185 --> 46:55.269
and I'm willing to pay for the answers.

46:55.395 --> 46:58.606
Now, I don't need to be told that a man
who goes after his mother

46:58.732 --> 47:03.569
with a coffee table is putting himself in
a weak position legally, that's obvious.

47:03.695 --> 47:06.322
John, come and have a look
out this fabulous picture window.

47:06.406 --> 47:08.825
If he hits her with it and kills her,
that's a criminal case.

47:08.909 --> 47:12.119
- Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
- Lf all he does is break the coffee table

47:12.246 --> 47:14.080
and give her
a certain amount of aggravation

47:14.206 --> 47:17.166
and she decides to
go to court over it, that's a civil case.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.836
Maybe we'll have a rainbow.
John, come have a look.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.005
Ma, how about doing everybody
a favour? How about shutting up!

47:23.423 --> 47:25.216
Settle down, now.

47:26.093 --> 47:30.054
Maybe I can look into it, recommend
someone. What do you say?

47:37.646 --> 47:40.773
So, what do you do, Frank?

47:41.942 --> 47:45.069
I work at Knox Business Machines,
actually.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.863
You design the machines?

47:46.947 --> 47:50.116
- Nope.
- Make them, sell them, repair them?

47:50.200 --> 47:53.160
- All these questions.
- I help sell them, I guess.

47:53.704 --> 47:58.165
I work in the office. Actually, it's...

47:58.250 --> 47:59.792
Well, it's sort of a stupid job, really.

47:59.877 --> 48:02.795
There's nothing interesting
about it at all.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.424
What do you do it for then?

48:06.508 --> 48:08.342
Maybe Frank doesn't like
being questioned like this.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.512
Okay, okay, okay.
I know it's none of my business.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.973
And besides, I know the answer.

48:14.808 --> 48:17.226
You want to play house,
you got to have a job.

48:17.311 --> 48:20.813
You want to play very nice house,
very sweet house,

48:20.898 --> 48:23.274
then you've got to have
a job you don't like.

48:23.358 --> 48:25.735
Anyone comes along and says,
"What do you do it for?"

48:25.819 --> 48:30.823
He's probably on a four-hour pass
from the state funny farm.

48:32.159 --> 48:35.703
- All agreed? Ma?
- Sorry, Frank.

48:35.787 --> 48:41.167
Don't be. Don't be. Actually, John,
I agree with everything you just said.

48:41.335 --> 48:45.922
We both do. That's why I'm quitting
the job in the fall. We're taking off.

48:46.006 --> 48:47.840
We're moving to Paris.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.679
Did you know about this, Ma?

48:55.349 --> 49:00.019
How do you feel about that, Ma?
The nice young Wheelers...

49:03.523 --> 49:08.694
The nice young Wheelers are taking off.

49:14.701 --> 49:18.162
- John, please.
- Steady down, Son.

49:23.168 --> 49:27.546
John. John. How about some fresh air?
What do you say?

49:27.631 --> 49:29.423
If that's all right with you?

49:29.508 --> 49:33.094
- I don't know if it's such a good idea...
- lf John wants to, I don't see the harm.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.596
- Good.
- After you.

49:39.893 --> 49:45.773
- I hear you're a mathematician.
- You hear wrong. It's all gone now.

49:46.692 --> 49:47.817
All gone?

49:47.901 --> 49:50.820
You know what
electrical shock treatments are?

49:50.904 --> 49:52.613
Yes. Yes, I do.

49:52.739 --> 49:54.365
I've had 37.

49:58.078 --> 50:00.955
Supposed to jolt out
the emotional problems.

50:01.081 --> 50:05.543
- Just jolted out the mathematics.
- How awful.

50:06.336 --> 50:11.298
"How awful"? Why,
because mathematics is so interesting?

50:12.092 --> 50:15.094
No. Because the shocks
must be awful and,

50:15.429 --> 50:19.515
well, because it's awful not to be able
to do what it is that you want to do.

50:19.599 --> 50:22.143
I think mathematics must be dull.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.813
I like your girl, Frank.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.231
Me, too.

50:27.649 --> 50:30.901
So, what do a couple of people like you
have to run away from?

50:30.986 --> 50:33.404
- We're not running.
- So what's in Paris?

50:33.488 --> 50:36.615
- A different way of life.
- Maybe we are running.

50:37.367 --> 50:41.537
We're running from the hopeless
emptiness of the whole life here, right?

50:41.621 --> 50:43.539
The hopeless emptiness?

50:47.669 --> 50:52.089
Now you've said it. Plenty of people
are on to the emptiness,

50:54.134 --> 50:57.178
but it takes real guts
to see the hopelessness.

51:02.601 --> 51:03.601
Wow.

51:18.241 --> 51:20.826
You know, he's the first person

51:20.952 --> 51:23.829
who seemed to know
what we were talking about.

51:23.914 --> 51:29.835
Yeah. That's true, isn't it?
Maybe we are just as crazy as he is.

51:31.838 --> 51:35.424
If being crazy means
living life as if it matters,

51:35.509 --> 51:38.511
then I don't care
if we are completely insane.

51:41.181 --> 51:42.431
Do you?

51:45.393 --> 51:46.393
No.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.564
I love you so much.

52:01.868 --> 52:05.204
Tell you something, Frank.
That Ted Bandy, nice guy.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.789
Real sport.

52:06.873 --> 52:08.624
Good enough department head and all.

52:08.708 --> 52:10.793
But I'm a little sore at him
for the way he's kept you

52:10.877 --> 52:12.962
under a bushel all these years.

52:13.046 --> 52:16.632
- This place okay for you?
- It's just fine, sir. Just fine.

52:17.425 --> 52:20.052
One thing interests me, Frank,
and one thing only.

52:20.137 --> 52:23.889
Selling the electronic computer
to the American businessman.

52:24.391 --> 52:28.561
That's why I'm assembling a team.
Men like you.

52:29.187 --> 52:30.938
Not your average salesmen.

52:31.022 --> 52:32.314
It'll mean more money,

52:32.399 --> 52:36.026
and, I got to be honest,
maybe more of a time commitment.

52:36.153 --> 52:39.572
But you'll be a part of
something exciting, Wheeler.

52:39.656 --> 52:40.990
Computers.

52:44.202 --> 52:47.413
Well, sir, it sounds exciting.

52:47.497 --> 52:49.248
- Bart.
- Bart.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.755
Bart, let me ask you a question.

52:57.424 --> 53:01.093
Do you happen to remember
an Earl Wheeler? Out of Yonkers?

53:02.429 --> 53:06.765
- Can't say that I do. Relation of yours?
- My father.

53:06.850 --> 53:10.269
He worked as a salesman for Knox
for almost 20 years.

53:11.897 --> 53:16.358
Earl Wheeler.

53:18.737 --> 53:21.322
There's no reason you'd remember him.

53:22.782 --> 53:25.242
Well, I'm sure he was a good man.

53:32.042 --> 53:37.421
Listen, Bart, there's something
I should have mentioned earlier.

53:39.466 --> 53:42.426
I'm going to be leaving the firm
in the fall.

53:44.221 --> 53:47.389
- Another outfit?
- No, no, it's not another outfit.

53:47.474 --> 53:50.309
Now, look, Frank.
Is it a question of money?

53:50.977 --> 53:52.394
Because if it is, there's no reason

53:52.479 --> 53:53.562
we can't get together on a satisfactory...

53:53.647 --> 53:56.899
Well, I sure appreciate that,
but no, it's not the money.

53:56.983 --> 54:01.987
It's... Well, it's more of a personal thing.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.323
I hope you understand.

54:04.658 --> 54:06.325
A personal thing?

54:07.202 --> 54:08.410
I see.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.957
Frank, let me tell you something
my father told me.

54:13.250 --> 54:16.252
A man only gets
a couple of chances in life.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.587
If he doesn't grab them by the balls,

54:18.672 --> 54:20.464
it won't be long before
he's sitting around wondering

54:20.548 --> 54:22.883
how he got to be second rate.

54:28.848 --> 54:30.349
I guess so.

54:31.434 --> 54:34.186
So, do me a favour. Sleep on it.

54:35.981 --> 54:38.023
Discuss it with your wife.

54:39.317 --> 54:40.943
Because let's be honest,
where the hell would any of us be

54:41.027 --> 54:43.070
without our wives, anyway?

54:46.533 --> 54:50.286
And, Frank, in all sincerity,
if you do decide to join us,

54:50.370 --> 54:53.539
I believe it'll be a thing
you'll never regret.

54:54.541 --> 54:57.167
And I believe something else, too.

54:57.502 --> 55:00.629
I believe it'd be a fine memorial
to your dad.

55:03.049 --> 55:06.135
Think about it, Frank.
Really think about it.

55:13.018 --> 55:15.394
Knowing what you've got, comma,

55:17.480 --> 55:20.232
knowing what you need, comma,

55:21.901 --> 55:25.821
knowing what you can do without, dash.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.742
That's inventory control.

55:47.886 --> 55:50.429
Knowing what you've got, comma,

55:52.265 --> 55:54.892
knowing what you need, comma,

55:56.811 --> 56:00.606
knowing what you can do without, dash.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.443
That's inventory control.

56:06.404 --> 56:07.780
Hi, Frank.

56:09.657 --> 56:11.116
Working late?

56:11.951 --> 56:15.454
Yeah. I got to dig myself out here.

56:17.665 --> 56:20.209
I heard you were getting promoted.

56:21.544 --> 56:22.920
Big shot.

56:26.591 --> 56:29.760
I guess your dad would have been
real proud, huh?

56:37.811 --> 56:39.686
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

56:49.197 --> 56:52.574
So maybe I should take you
for a drink or something?

56:53.868 --> 56:56.662
You know, celebrate.

57:01.334 --> 57:02.793
Yeah, maybe.

57:07.340 --> 57:09.341
I'll just get my things.

57:17.016 --> 57:18.934
I'm going to bring my doll carriage

57:19.018 --> 57:21.937
and my three Easter rabbits
and my giraffe

57:22.021 --> 57:25.107
and all my dolls and my doll house
and my crayons...

57:25.191 --> 57:26.942
I thought maybe
we'd give the doll house to Madeline.

57:27.026 --> 57:29.069
I don't want to give the doll house
to Madeline.

57:29.154 --> 57:30.362
But I already explained to you,

57:30.447 --> 57:32.072
the big things
are going to be hard to pack.

57:32.157 --> 57:33.574
But she can have my bear,

57:33.658 --> 57:37.119
- and my three Easter rabbits.
- No! Just the big things.

57:37.203 --> 57:39.288
Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside
and play with Michael?

57:39.372 --> 57:41.874
- I don't feel like it.
- You've been inside all day.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.167
I don't feel like it.

57:43.251 --> 57:46.420
Well, I don't feel like
explaining everything 15 times

57:46.504 --> 57:49.631
to somebody who's too bored and silly
to listen!

57:56.473 --> 57:59.224
- All right, April. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

57:59.309 --> 58:02.060
I don't believe you.
Did something happen this morning?

58:02.145 --> 58:05.564
Nothing happened today that I haven't
known about for days and days.

58:05.648 --> 58:06.732
What?

58:07.400 --> 58:10.319
Oh, God, Frank,
please don't look so dense.

58:10.403 --> 58:12.154
You mean you haven't guessed
or anything?

58:12.238 --> 58:14.656
April, what are you talking about?

58:17.827 --> 58:19.912
I'm pregnant, that's all.

58:22.707 --> 58:23.749
What?

58:23.875 --> 58:26.168
Frank, I meant to wait
till the kids were in bed to tell you,

58:26.252 --> 58:29.171
but I just...
Well, I've been pretty sure all week

58:29.255 --> 58:30.589
and today I went to the doctor,

58:30.673 --> 58:33.509
and now I can't even pretend
it's not true.

58:34.969 --> 58:37.012
- How long?
- Ten weeks.

58:39.432 --> 58:43.852
Ten weeks. Ten weeks?
And you wait until now to tell me?

58:43.937 --> 58:49.775
No, well, I thought... I don't know what
I thought. I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.

58:50.026 --> 58:52.694
I know. I know you are. All right?

58:53.821 --> 58:55.948
But there are things we can do.

58:56.032 --> 58:59.034
We don't have to let this stop us
from going, do we?

58:59.118 --> 59:01.370
Remember that girl at school
I told you about?

59:01.454 --> 59:05.123
As long as we take care of it
before 12 weeks, it's fine.

59:06.292 --> 59:09.044
We've got to be together in this, Frank.

59:11.339 --> 59:16.051
Well, we'll figure it out. All right?

59:18.471 --> 59:19.805
Come here.

59:22.642 --> 59:26.144
Twelve weeks.
So we have time to decide, right?

59:26.604 --> 59:27.813
Right.

59:30.149 --> 59:31.567
I love you.

59:35.738 --> 59:37.406
I love you, too.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:25.662
So, Frank, how's work?
They gonna survive without you?

1:00:27.832 --> 1:00:30.959
Actually, something kind of funny
happened the other day.

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:35.631
I did some dumb little piece of work
to get myself off the hook with Bandy,

1:00:35.715 --> 1:00:38.550
and suddenly,
I'm the bright young man.

1:00:39.719 --> 1:00:42.304
- That's always the way, ain't it?
- It's incredible.

1:00:42.388 --> 1:00:44.389
I mean, I knocked this thing off
in a couple of minutes

1:00:44.474 --> 1:00:48.393
and now they want me to join
their team of "specialist" salesmen.

1:00:48.728 --> 1:00:50.062
Morons.

1:00:52.148 --> 1:00:54.024
Well, it would be funny
if they weren't offering

1:00:54.108 --> 1:00:55.901
so much damn money.

1:01:00.531 --> 1:01:02.324
So, are you tempted?

1:01:02.909 --> 1:01:06.078
Well, it's just kind of ironic,
don't you think?

1:01:29.769 --> 1:01:32.270
I thought you turned the job down.

1:01:33.606 --> 1:01:34.815
Not yet.

1:01:35.983 --> 1:01:38.318
It's just an option, that's all.

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:42.406
With the kind of money they're talking,
things could be different for us here.

1:01:42.490 --> 1:01:45.158
We could get a better place. Travel.

1:01:46.077 --> 1:01:49.371
The point is, we could be happy here,
at least for a little while.

1:01:49.455 --> 1:01:51.707
It is possible that Parisians
aren't the only ones

1:01:51.791 --> 1:01:54.710
capable of leading
interesting lives, April.

1:01:54.794 --> 1:01:56.753
So you've made up your mind?

1:01:56.838 --> 1:02:00.882
No. No. Like I said, it's just an option.
That's all.

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:06.888
And supposing you're right.

1:02:07.098 --> 1:02:11.059
You make all this money
and we have this interesting life here.

1:02:11.519 --> 1:02:16.314
Won't you still be wasting your life
toiling away at a job you find ridiculous?

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:19.443
Maybe we let that be my business,
all right?

1:02:19.527 --> 1:02:20.944
Your business?

1:02:21.028 --> 1:02:24.948
You know what? It's too hot for this.
I'm going to go get wet.

1:02:37.003 --> 1:02:40.422
- You don't want to go, do you?
- Come on, April. Of course, I do.

1:02:40.506 --> 1:02:43.467
No, you don't.
Because you've never tried at anything.

1:02:43.551 --> 1:02:46.344
And if you don't try at anything,
you can't fail.

1:02:46.429 --> 1:02:48.764
What the hell do you mean I don't try?

1:02:48.848 --> 1:02:51.308
I support you, don't I?
I pay for this house.

1:02:51.392 --> 1:02:53.935
I work 10 hours a day
at a job I can't stand.

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:56.271
- You don't have to.
- Bullshit!

1:02:56.522 --> 1:02:57.731
Look, I'm not happy about it.

1:02:57.815 --> 1:03:00.776
But I have the backbone not to run away
from my responsibilities.

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:04.112
It takes backbone
to lead the life you want, Frank.

1:03:08.743 --> 1:03:09.785
Where are you going?

1:03:09.869 --> 1:03:14.206
If it's all right with you, April,
I'm gonna go use the bathroom. Okay?

1:03:42.401 --> 1:03:45.320
What the hell are you going to do
with this?

1:03:45.404 --> 1:03:46.905
And what do you think
you're going to do?

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:48.657
- You're going to stop me?
- You're damn right I am!

1:03:48.741 --> 1:03:49.908
Go ahead and try.

1:03:49.992 --> 1:03:53.703
Listen to me. You do this, April,
you do this and I swear to God I'll...

1:03:53.788 --> 1:03:56.122
You'll what? You'll leave me?
Is that a threat or a promise?

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:57.332
When did you buy this, April?

1:03:57.416 --> 1:03:59.000
How long have you had this?
I want to know!

1:03:59.085 --> 1:04:00.043
Jesus Christ.

1:04:00.127 --> 1:04:03.129
You really are being melodramatic
about this whole thing.

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:06.842
As long as it's done
in the first 12 weeks, it's perfectly safe.

1:04:06.926 --> 1:04:10.053
- That's now, April! Don't I get a say?
- Of course you do!

1:04:10.137 --> 1:04:12.389
It would be for you, Frank.
Don't you see?

1:04:12.473 --> 1:04:14.432
So you can have time,
just like we talked about.

1:04:14.517 --> 1:04:15.892
How can it be for me
when the thought of it

1:04:15.977 --> 1:04:17.978
makes my stomach turn over,
for God's sake?

1:04:18.062 --> 1:04:19.479
Then it's for me.

1:04:19.564 --> 1:04:21.439
Tell me we can have the baby
in Paris, Frank.

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:25.735
Tell me we can have a different life.
But don't make me stay here. Please.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:29.114
- We can't have the baby in Paris.
- Why not?

1:04:29.198 --> 1:04:32.242
I don't need everything we have here.
I don't care where we live.

1:04:32.326 --> 1:04:34.953
I mean, who made these rules, anyway?

1:04:35.955 --> 1:04:41.001
Look, the only reason we moved
out here was because I got pregnant.

1:04:41.085 --> 1:04:43.628
Then we had another child to prove
the first one wasn't a mistake.

1:04:43.713 --> 1:04:46.047
I mean, how long does it go on?

1:04:47.341 --> 1:04:50.969
Frank.
Do you actually want another child?

1:04:52.930 --> 1:04:56.433
Well, do you? Come on, tell me.

1:04:57.393 --> 1:05:00.353
Tell me the truth, Frank.
Remember that?

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:02.772
We used to live by it.

1:05:02.857 --> 1:05:05.275
And you know what's so good
about the truth?

1:05:05.359 --> 1:05:09.279
Everyone knows what it is,
however long they've lived without it.

1:05:09.363 --> 1:05:13.491
No one forgets the truth, Frank.
They just get better at lying.

1:05:15.286 --> 1:05:20.206
So tell me,
do you really want another child?

1:05:22.084 --> 1:05:24.210
All I know is what I feel.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:31.051
And anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way, April.

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:35.430
But I've had two children.
Doesn't that count in my favour?

1:05:35.556 --> 1:05:38.475
Christ, April!
The fact that you even put it that way!

1:05:38.559 --> 1:05:42.562
You make it seem as if having children
is some sort of a goddamn punishment.

1:05:42.688 --> 1:05:44.731
I love my children, Frank.

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:49.069
And you're sure about that, huh?

1:05:49.570 --> 1:05:51.780
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1:05:51.864 --> 1:05:55.533
April, you just said our daughter
was a mistake.

1:05:56.035 --> 1:05:57.953
How do I know you didn't try
to get rid of her,

1:05:58.037 --> 1:05:59.663
- or Michael for that matter?
- No.

1:05:59.747 --> 1:06:02.624
How do I know you didn't try to flush
our entire fucking family

1:06:02.708 --> 1:06:05.710
- down the toilet?
- No, that's not true. Of course I didn't.

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:07.796
But how do I know, April?

1:06:07.922 --> 1:06:11.007
Stop. Please just stop, Frank.

1:06:11.509 --> 1:06:15.887
April, a normal woman,
a normal sane mother

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:19.307
doesn't buy a piece of rubber tubing
to give herself an abortion

1:06:19.392 --> 1:06:22.686
so she can live out
some kind of a goddamn fantasy.

1:06:33.239 --> 1:06:38.368
Look, all I'm saying is you don't seem
entirely rational about this thing.

1:06:40.037 --> 1:06:41.997
And I think it's about time
we found somebody

1:06:42.081 --> 1:06:44.416
to help make some sense of your life.

1:06:45.668 --> 1:06:48.670
And the newjob's going to
pay for that, too?

1:06:50.923 --> 1:06:55.677
April, if you need a shrink,
it will be paid for.

1:06:56.762 --> 1:06:58.138
Obviously.

1:07:02.309 --> 1:07:06.646
Okay. I guess there isn't much more
to say then, is there?

1:07:16.157 --> 1:07:19.325
So I guess Paris
was a pretty childish idea, huh?

1:07:25.374 --> 1:07:27.208
I guess maybe it was.

1:07:40.473 --> 1:07:44.559
April, we can be happy here.

1:07:45.853 --> 1:07:47.896
I can make you happy here.

1:07:48.647 --> 1:07:52.400
We've had a great couple of months.
It doesn't need to end.

1:07:54.987 --> 1:07:59.032
We're going to be okay. I promise.

1:08:03.287 --> 1:08:04.954
I hope so, Frank.

1:08:06.749 --> 1:08:08.416
I really hope so.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:52.335
Thank you for waiting.
Mr Pollock will see you now.

1:08:54.296 --> 1:08:55.880
Thanks so much.

1:09:06.642 --> 1:09:09.018
Foiled by faulty contraception.

1:09:10.896 --> 1:09:12.397
I can't say that I'm sorry.

1:09:12.481 --> 1:09:16.192
You'd have been sorely missed
in the old cubicle, I can tell you that.

1:09:16.277 --> 1:09:19.028
Wouldn't have been the same
without you.

1:09:19.113 --> 1:09:22.240
Besides... Well...

1:09:24.910 --> 1:09:25.952
What?

1:09:27.329 --> 1:09:32.417
The plan always seemed
a touch unrealistic, don't you think?

1:09:37.131 --> 1:09:38.506
I suppose
it's none of my business, really.

1:09:38.591 --> 1:09:41.926
No. No. I suppose it isn't.

1:09:45.598 --> 1:09:46.764
Well...

1:09:49.727 --> 1:09:53.146
They'll be celebrating
in the secretarial pool.

1:10:22.426 --> 1:10:25.386
Hey! Do you remember the first time
you brought us here?

1:10:25.471 --> 1:10:26.638
Absolutely.

1:10:26.722 --> 1:10:30.892
You said it takes a special kind of taste
to enjoy Vito's Log Cabin.

1:10:31.018 --> 1:10:33.770
It's so awful, it's kind of nice.

1:10:37.399 --> 1:10:43.488
Look at me. I'm just so happy.
Our little gang's back together again.

1:10:47.701 --> 1:10:49.786
How do you like the boys in the band?
Aren't they swinging tonight?

1:10:56.585 --> 1:10:59.963
- Hey, Europe's not going anywhere.
- That's right.

1:11:22.778 --> 1:11:25.488
April, honey, how about a dance?

1:11:27.950 --> 1:11:30.535
Not right now. Maybe later.

1:11:30.619 --> 1:11:33.204
- I'll dance.
- Okay.

1:11:48.053 --> 1:11:51.180
Guess she's still pretty blue
about Paris, huh?

1:11:51.890 --> 1:11:53.141
Think she'll be okay?

1:11:53.225 --> 1:11:57.020
Sure. Give us girls a couple of days
and we can get over anything.

1:11:57.104 --> 1:11:58.313
Right.

1:12:00.065 --> 1:12:10.992
Frank.

1:12:11.076 --> 1:12:13.911
Are you okay? Are you okay? Milly?

1:12:14.621 --> 1:12:16.080
I'm so sorry.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:18.541
Excuse me.

1:12:23.464 --> 1:12:25.131
That's just great.

1:12:25.883 --> 1:12:28.843
How the hell
are we supposed to get out now?

1:12:29.219 --> 1:12:30.470
Oh, boy.

1:12:32.056 --> 1:12:34.891
Don't worry about it, Shep.
We can wait. Really.

1:12:35.059 --> 1:12:36.559
What about the sitter?

1:12:36.643 --> 1:12:39.729
Listen, why don't you drive Milly home,
then go home yourself.

1:12:39.813 --> 1:12:42.774
That takes care of both sitters.
Then Shep can take me home later.

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:45.526
- Yeah, it's fine by me.
- Okay, then.

1:12:46.862 --> 1:12:50.448
- You... You'll be all right?
- Sure.

1:12:51.241 --> 1:12:52.367
Okay.

1:12:53.911 --> 1:12:55.828
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:12:56.455 --> 1:12:57.830
Feel better.

1:13:17.810 --> 1:13:20.561
I'm sorry you're not
going away any more.

1:13:21.688 --> 1:13:24.065
I know it was important to you.

1:13:25.317 --> 1:13:29.779
Don't take this wrong,
but I've been there.

1:13:30.614 --> 1:13:33.491
They don't have so much
we don't have here.

1:13:34.118 --> 1:13:36.244
It didn't have to be Paris.

1:13:37.663 --> 1:13:41.332
You just wanted out, huh?

1:13:41.875 --> 1:13:43.334
I wanted in.

1:13:46.755 --> 1:13:50.425
I just wanted us to live again.

1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:59.100
For years,
I thought we shared this secret.

1:14:02.187 --> 1:14:04.981
That we would be
wonderful in the world.

1:14:08.610 --> 1:14:11.195
I didn't exactly know how, but just...

1:14:12.781 --> 1:14:15.324
Just the possibility kept me hoping.

1:14:22.499 --> 1:14:24.375
How pathetic is that?

1:14:26.295 --> 1:14:27.753
So stupid.

1:14:30.132 --> 1:14:35.261
To put all your hopes in a promise
that was never made?

1:14:39.266 --> 1:14:42.226
See, Frank knows.
He knows what he wants.

1:14:42.519 --> 1:14:45.146
He's found his place. He's just fine.

1:14:46.565 --> 1:14:48.274
Married, two kids.

1:14:53.405 --> 1:14:55.198
It should be enough.

1:15:00.537 --> 1:15:02.038
It is for him.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:08.252
And he's right.

1:15:10.881 --> 1:15:14.509
We were never special or destined
or anything at all.

1:15:15.052 --> 1:15:16.761
Yes, you are.

1:15:18.263 --> 1:15:19.597
You're...

1:15:21.266 --> 1:15:23.059
You're the Wheelers.

1:15:23.185 --> 1:15:26.145
You're a terrific couple.
Everybody says so.

1:15:27.481 --> 1:15:29.732
I saw a whole other future.

1:15:33.278 --> 1:15:35.196
I can't stop seeing it.

1:15:40.452 --> 1:15:41.827
Can't leave,

1:15:44.081 --> 1:15:45.498
can't stay.

1:15:47.834 --> 1:15:49.710
No damn use to anyone.

1:15:57.803 --> 1:15:59.053
Come on.

1:16:00.639 --> 1:16:02.014
Let's do it.

1:17:11.752 --> 1:17:12.960
Let me take you somewhere.

1:17:13.045 --> 1:17:16.422
No. Just do it here. Now.

1:18:03.387 --> 1:18:04.553
April.

1:18:07.265 --> 1:18:09.600
This is what I've always wanted.

1:18:11.019 --> 1:18:12.395
I love you.

1:18:13.397 --> 1:18:14.939
Don't say that.

1:18:16.566 --> 1:18:20.152
No. I mean it, I love you.

1:18:20.278 --> 1:18:24.115
Please, just be quiet for a minute.

1:18:28.578 --> 1:18:30.705
Then you can take me home.

1:19:21.673 --> 1:19:23.382
It's beautiful out.

1:19:24.634 --> 1:19:26.051
Yes, it is.

1:19:31.016 --> 1:19:32.933
You know what today is?

1:19:33.477 --> 1:19:35.978
- It's 12 weeks.
- That's right.

1:19:39.941 --> 1:19:43.486
Look, this has been
kind of a crazy summer.

1:19:43.570 --> 1:19:45.613
We've both been under a strain.

1:19:45.697 --> 1:19:48.449
I mean, I understand why you're upset.

1:19:49.159 --> 1:19:52.953
You know I'm not sleeping with you,
and you want to know why.

1:19:54.372 --> 1:19:59.210
Well, I'm sorry, Frank,
but I really don't feel like talking about it.

1:19:59.878 --> 1:20:02.880
All right.
Then what should we talk about, April?

1:20:02.964 --> 1:20:06.383
Would it be all right
if we didn't talk about anything?

1:20:06.468 --> 1:20:10.095
I mean, can't we just take each day
as it comes, and do the best we can,

1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:13.808
and not feel like we have to talk
about everything all the time?

1:20:13.892 --> 1:20:17.269
I don't think I'm suggesting that
we talk about everything all the time.

1:20:17.354 --> 1:20:21.565
Look, my point is we've both been
under a strain

1:20:21.650 --> 1:20:25.903
and we ought to be helping each other
out as much as we can right now.

1:20:25.987 --> 1:20:29.949
I mean, God knows my own behaviour
has been pretty weird lately.

1:20:32.577 --> 1:20:36.664
As a matter of fact, there is something
I'd like to tell you about.

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:41.961
I've been with a girl a few times,
in the city.

1:20:43.755 --> 1:20:46.048
A girl I hardly even know.

1:20:46.550 --> 1:20:49.176
It was nothing to me,

1:20:49.261 --> 1:20:53.264
but it's over now, really over.

1:20:54.099 --> 1:20:57.893
And if I weren't sure of that, I guess
I could never have told you about it.

1:21:03.233 --> 1:21:04.692
Why did you?

1:21:05.443 --> 1:21:07.278
Baby, I don't know.

1:21:07.821 --> 1:21:10.364
I think it's a simple case
of wanting to be a man again

1:21:10.448 --> 1:21:12.157
after all that abortion business.

1:21:12.242 --> 1:21:15.953
Some kind of neurotic,
irrational need to prove something.

1:21:16.037 --> 1:21:19.331
No. I don't mean
why did you have the girl.

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:22.209
I mean, why did you tell me about it?

1:21:24.671 --> 1:21:27.798
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what's the point?

1:21:29.968 --> 1:21:33.220
Is it supposed to make me jealous
or something?

1:21:33.305 --> 1:21:35.139
Is it supposed to make me
fall in love with you,

1:21:35.223 --> 1:21:38.017
or back into bed with you, or what?

1:21:38.101 --> 1:21:41.770
I mean,
what would you like me to say, Frank?

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:46.150
Why don't you say what you feel, April?

1:21:47.235 --> 1:21:49.153
I don't feel anything.

1:21:49.821 --> 1:21:53.908
In other words, you don't care what I do
or who I fuck or anything?

1:21:57.579 --> 1:22:00.873
No, I guess that's right. I don't.

1:22:03.293 --> 1:22:05.002
Fuck who you like.

1:22:05.337 --> 1:22:08.547
April, don't you understand
that I want you to care?

1:22:08.632 --> 1:22:10.841
I know. I know you do.

1:22:12.010 --> 1:22:14.219
And I suppose I would if I loved you.

1:22:14.304 --> 1:22:17.431
But I don't think I do any more.
And I only just figured that out.

1:22:17.515 --> 1:22:20.976
And that's why I'd just as soon
not do any talking right now.

1:22:21.061 --> 1:22:23.520
Don't give me that shit, April.
Don't give me that.

1:22:23.605 --> 1:22:26.231
- You know goddamn well you love me.
- You think so?

1:22:26.316 --> 1:22:28.192
You know goddamn well!

1:22:30.195 --> 1:22:31.695
Anyone home?

1:22:36.201 --> 1:22:39.244
I'm sorry dinner's late.
Would anyone like another drink?

1:22:39.329 --> 1:22:43.082
Don't worry.
It's nice to just sit a bit and socialise.

1:22:43.375 --> 1:22:45.000
You shouldn't have gone to
all this trouble.

1:22:45.085 --> 1:22:46.794
With all your packing and whatnot.

1:22:46.878 --> 1:22:50.673
I imagine you have a lot on your plate.
No pun intended.

1:22:52.133 --> 1:22:54.385
Actually, there's been
a change of plans.

1:22:55.303 --> 1:22:57.638
I thought maybe it was obvious.

1:22:57.722 --> 1:22:59.014
April here is pregnant.

1:22:59.099 --> 1:23:02.226
- Congratulations.
- Oh, April!

1:23:02.310 --> 1:23:05.479
I can't tell you how pleased I am!

1:23:05.563 --> 1:23:08.190
But I expect you'll be needing
a bigger house now, won't you?

1:23:08.274 --> 1:23:11.110
Hold it a second, Ma.
Hold on a second, Ma.

1:23:11.194 --> 1:23:15.155
I don't get this.
I mean, what's so obvious about it?

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:20.077
I mean, okay, she's pregnant, so what?
Don't people have babies in Europe?

1:23:20.161 --> 1:23:21.829
- John...
- Suppose we just say

1:23:21.913 --> 1:23:24.832
that people anywhere
aren't very well advised to have babies

1:23:24.916 --> 1:23:27.042
unless they can afford them.

1:23:27.711 --> 1:23:32.381
Okay. Okay, it's a question of money.
Money's a good reason.

1:23:32.465 --> 1:23:36.844
But it's hardly ever the real reason.

1:23:36.928 --> 1:23:42.141
What's the real reason?
Wife talk you out of it or what?

1:23:42.684 --> 1:23:46.645
Little woman decide she isn't
quite ready to quit playing house?

1:23:47.731 --> 1:23:50.107
No, no, that's not it. I can tell.

1:23:50.191 --> 1:23:53.318
She looks too tough
and adequate as hell.

1:23:55.238 --> 1:23:59.908
Okay, then. It must've been you.
What happened?

1:23:59.993 --> 1:24:04.621
- John, please. You're being very rude.
- No, no. What happened, Frank?

1:24:10.003 --> 1:24:11.336
You get cold feet?

1:24:11.421 --> 1:24:14.673
You decide
you're better off here after all?

1:24:15.425 --> 1:24:19.595
You figure it's more comfy

1:24:19.679 --> 1:24:24.183
here in the old hopeless emptiness
after all, huh?

1:24:25.268 --> 1:24:29.104
Oh, wow, that did it. Look at his face.

1:24:29.189 --> 1:24:31.482
What's the matter, Wheeler?
Am I getting warm?

1:24:31.566 --> 1:24:34.985
- All right, Son. I think we'd better be...
- You know something?

1:24:35.070 --> 1:24:37.988
I wouldn't be surprised
if he knocked her up on purpose

1:24:38.073 --> 1:24:41.742
just so he could spend the rest of his
life hiding behind a maternity dress.

1:24:41.826 --> 1:24:45.079
That way he'd never have to find out
what he's really made of.

1:24:45.163 --> 1:24:48.832
Now look, I think that's just about
enough out of you.

1:24:49.417 --> 1:24:51.710
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

1:24:51.795 --> 1:24:53.212
You come in here and say

1:24:53.296 --> 1:24:56.340
whatever crazy goddamn thing
comes into your head,

1:24:56.424 --> 1:24:59.718
and I think it's about time somebody told
you to keep your goddamn mouth shut.

1:24:59.803 --> 1:25:02.846
- He's not well, Frank.
- Not well, my ass!

1:25:03.056 --> 1:25:06.809
I don't give a damn
if he's sick or well or dead or alive,

1:25:06.893 --> 1:25:08.560
he should keep his fucking opinions

1:25:08.645 --> 1:25:12.189
in the fucking insane asylum
where they belong!

1:25:15.151 --> 1:25:17.569
- Let's go, Son.
- Come on, John.

1:25:21.991 --> 1:25:24.743
Big man you got there, April.

1:25:25.370 --> 1:25:27.329
Big family man.

1:25:31.042 --> 1:25:33.043
I feel sorry for you.

1:25:35.713 --> 1:25:39.174
Still, maybe you deserve each other.

1:25:39.259 --> 1:25:43.929
I mean, the way you look right now,
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too.

1:25:45.473 --> 1:25:47.850
You must give him a pretty bad time

1:25:47.934 --> 1:25:51.854
if making babies is the only way
he can prove he's got a pair of balls.

1:25:52.105 --> 1:25:56.692
- You fucking...
- No! He's not well, Frank!

1:26:08.496 --> 1:26:11.999
All right, John.
Let's get on out to the car now.

1:26:17.797 --> 1:26:20.757
April, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:26:20.842 --> 1:26:25.470
Oh, right. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry!

1:26:25.555 --> 1:26:28.515
Ma, have I said
"I'm sorry" enough times?

1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:30.893
Damn! I am sorry, too.

1:26:30.977 --> 1:26:33.937
I bet I'm just about
the sorriest bastard I know.

1:26:34.022 --> 1:26:38.150
But get right down to it, I don't have
a whole hell of a lot to be glad about.

1:26:38.234 --> 1:26:39.359
Do I?

1:26:42.071 --> 1:26:44.031
But, hey, you know what?

1:26:45.366 --> 1:26:47.451
I am glad about one thing.

1:26:48.036 --> 1:26:50.329
You want to know what I'm glad about?

1:26:52.749 --> 1:26:55.375
I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.

1:27:12.977 --> 1:27:16.438
Okay, okay, don't tell me.

1:27:17.023 --> 1:27:19.149
Don't tell me, let me guess.

1:27:19.734 --> 1:27:23.278
I made a disgusting spectacle
of myself, right?

1:27:25.031 --> 1:27:26.114
Right.

1:27:26.199 --> 1:27:27.824
And everything that man said
is true, right?

1:27:27.909 --> 1:27:29.701
Is that what you're going to say?

1:27:29.786 --> 1:27:31.912
Apparently I don't have to.

1:27:31.996 --> 1:27:34.998
- You're saying it for me.
- Well, you're wrong, April.

1:27:35.083 --> 1:27:38.794
- Really? Why am I wrong?
- Because the man is insane.

1:27:38.878 --> 1:27:42.130
He's fucking insane! Do you know what
the definition of insanity is?

1:27:42.215 --> 1:27:43.382
No. Do you?

1:27:43.466 --> 1:27:46.969
Yes, it's the inability
to relate to another human being.

1:27:47.053 --> 1:27:49.137
It's the inability to love.

1:27:54.143 --> 1:27:56.853
April. April.

1:27:57.438 --> 1:28:00.190
April! April!

1:28:00.275 --> 1:28:04.528
The inability... The inability to love.

1:28:06.364 --> 1:28:09.324
Frank. You really are a wonderful talker.

1:28:09.409 --> 1:28:12.744
If black could be made into white
by talking,

1:28:12.829 --> 1:28:14.871
you'd be the man for the job.

1:28:14.956 --> 1:28:17.457
So now I'm crazy
because I don't love you. Right?

1:28:17.542 --> 1:28:19.626
- Is that the point?
- No. Wrong.

1:28:19.711 --> 1:28:23.672
You're not crazy and you do love me.
That's the point, April.

1:28:24.132 --> 1:28:27.384
But I don't. I hate you.

1:28:27.927 --> 1:28:30.721
You were just some boy
who made me laugh at a party? Once

1:28:30.805 --> 1:28:33.307
and now I loathe the sight of you.

1:28:33.850 --> 1:28:37.436
In fact, if you come any closer,
if you touch me or anything,

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:39.396
I think I'll scream.

1:28:40.648 --> 1:28:42.691
Come on. Stop this, April.

1:28:48.239 --> 1:28:50.198
Fuck you, April!

1:28:50.283 --> 1:28:53.702
Fuck you and all your hateful,
stuck-up, little goddamn...

1:28:53.786 --> 1:28:56.496
What're you going to do now?
Are you going to hit me?

1:28:56.581 --> 1:28:59.624
- To show me how much you love me?
- Don't worry, I can't be bothered!

1:28:59.792 --> 1:29:02.461
You're not worth the trouble
it would take to hit you.

1:29:02.545 --> 1:29:05.255
You're not worth the powder
it would take to blow you up.

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:09.634
You're an empty, empty,
hollow shell of a woman!

1:29:10.762 --> 1:29:14.765
What the hell are you doing in my house
if you hate me so much?

1:29:15.308 --> 1:29:17.559
Why the hell are you married to me?

1:29:17.643 --> 1:29:20.520
What the hell are you doing
carrying my child?

1:29:20.605 --> 1:29:23.315
I mean, why didn't you just get
rid of it when you had the chance?

1:29:23.399 --> 1:29:26.443
Because listen to me.
Listen to me, I got news for you.

1:29:26.527 --> 1:29:28.695
I wish to God that you had.

1:30:02.772 --> 1:30:29.840
April!

1:30:37.974 --> 1:30:39.891
- April!
- Stay away from me.

1:30:40.017 --> 1:30:42.060
- April, listen.
- Stay away from me.

1:30:42.145 --> 1:30:44.062
Can't I even get away from you
in the fucking woods?

1:30:44.147 --> 1:30:46.148
April, listen, I didn't mean that.

1:30:46.232 --> 1:30:48.608
- Honestly, I didn't mean what I said.
- Are you still talking?

1:30:48.693 --> 1:30:51.528
Isn't there any way to stop your talking?

1:30:52.155 --> 1:30:55.740
I need to think. Can't you see that?
I need to think.

1:30:58.161 --> 1:30:59.953
Please come back to the house.
What're you doing out here, April?

1:31:00.037 --> 1:31:01.621
Do you want me to scream again,
Frank?

1:31:01.706 --> 1:31:03.915
Because I will! I mean it!

1:31:12.592 --> 1:31:15.051
Okay. Okay.

1:34:48.307 --> 1:34:53.395
Good morning.

1:34:55.147 --> 1:34:57.816
Would you like
scrambled eggs or fried?

1:35:02.738 --> 1:35:04.322
I don't know.

1:35:05.074 --> 1:35:10.161
It doesn't really matter.
Scrambled, I guess, if it's easy.

1:35:10.913 --> 1:35:13.915
Fine. I'll have scrambled, too.

1:36:11.849 --> 1:36:16.227
It's kind of nice having breakfast
without the kids for a change, huh?

1:36:16.312 --> 1:36:17.479
Yes.

1:36:18.397 --> 1:36:21.316
I thought you'd probably want
a good breakfast today.

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:24.652
I mean, it's kind of an important day
for you, isn't it?

1:36:25.488 --> 1:36:29.032
Isn't this the day you have
your conference with Pollock?

1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:33.453
Yes. Yes, that's right.

1:36:35.498 --> 1:36:39.417
- Big deal.
- I imagine it is a pretty big deal.

1:36:40.085 --> 1:36:41.836
For them, anyway.

1:36:43.088 --> 1:36:46.758
What exactly do you think
you'll be doing in your newjob?

1:36:47.134 --> 1:36:49.928
You haven't really
told me much about it.

1:36:50.763 --> 1:36:52.180
Haven't I?

1:36:54.350 --> 1:36:56.559
Well, I think this whole thing
is about Knox getting ready

1:36:56.644 --> 1:36:59.938
to buy up one of those
really big computers,

1:37:00.022 --> 1:37:02.148
even bigger than the 500.

1:37:03.150 --> 1:37:06.528
- Didn't I tell you about that?
- No.

1:37:07.196 --> 1:37:09.239
Why don't you tell me now?

1:37:13.536 --> 1:37:14.619
Well,

1:37:15.996 --> 1:37:20.458
you know, basically it's just a big,
fast adding machine.

1:37:22.127 --> 1:37:25.839
Only, instead of mechanical parts,
you see,

1:37:26.549 --> 1:37:31.886
you've got thousands
of individual vacuum tubes.

1:37:42.731 --> 1:37:43.982
I see.

1:37:51.824 --> 1:37:53.867
At least I think I see.

1:37:57.705 --> 1:38:00.790
Yes, it's really kind of interesting,
isn't it?

1:38:03.377 --> 1:38:05.211
Well, I don't know.

1:38:07.256 --> 1:38:10.466
Yeah, I guess it is kind of interesting,
in a way.

1:38:15.222 --> 1:38:17.807
You should value what you do, Frank.

1:38:19.059 --> 1:38:21.227
You're obviously good at it.

1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:39.871
Well, I guess
I'd better be getting started, huh?

1:38:46.754 --> 1:38:49.088
Listen, though, April, the...

1:38:51.175 --> 1:38:53.009
This was really nice.

1:38:54.595 --> 1:38:57.680
I mean, it was a swell breakfast.
Really, I...

1:38:58.557 --> 1:39:01.893
I don't know when I've ever had
a nicer breakfast.

1:39:04.146 --> 1:39:08.066
Thank you. I enjoyed it, too.

1:39:29.838 --> 1:39:33.967
Then you don't...
You don't hate me or anything?

1:39:36.595 --> 1:39:40.306
No. No, of course I don't.

1:39:51.068 --> 1:39:52.694
Have a good day.

1:39:59.451 --> 1:40:03.204
Okay, then. So long.

1:41:45.432 --> 1:41:49.977
Hello. Milly? Everything all right?

1:41:52.272 --> 1:41:56.901
Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not feeling
any better. That's really why I called.

1:41:58.445 --> 1:42:02.532
If it's not an inconvenience for you,
this evening would be great.

1:42:03.534 --> 1:42:04.575
What?

1:42:07.287 --> 1:42:12.291
Oh, no. No.
Not if they're outdoors playing.

1:42:16.588 --> 1:42:18.631
Don't call them in.

1:42:18.715 --> 1:42:23.136
Just give them each a kiss for me,

1:42:24.721 --> 1:42:26.639
and tell them I...

1:42:28.308 --> 1:42:29.809
Tell them...

1:42:31.103 --> 1:42:36.983
You know. All right. All right.
Thank you, Milly. Bye.

1:46:08.820 --> 1:46:11.572
I think I need help.

1:46:13.075 --> 1:46:17.036
115 Revolutionary Road.

1:46:43.897 --> 1:46:46.690
- Frank. They tell you what happened?
- Jesus Christ.

1:46:46.775 --> 1:46:49.318
Shep, I didn't understand
half the things he told me.

1:46:49.403 --> 1:46:52.196
He said the foetus was out
before they got her here.

1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:56.992
And they had to operate to take out
the, what do you call it, the placenta?

1:46:57.077 --> 1:46:59.412
And now she's still bleeding.

1:46:59.496 --> 1:47:02.206
He said that she'd lost a lot of blood
before the ambulance came,

1:47:02.290 --> 1:47:04.708
and now they're trying to stop it.

1:47:04.918 --> 1:47:09.296
He said a whole lot of things
I didn't understand about capillaries...

1:47:10.006 --> 1:47:14.385
He said that she's unconscious. Jesus.

1:47:14.469 --> 1:47:16.345
Okay, Frank,
why don't you just take a seat?

1:47:16.430 --> 1:47:18.806
What the hell do I want to sit down for,
for God's sake?

1:47:18.890 --> 1:47:23.060
Okay, Frank. Just take it easy.
Take it easy.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:28.941
- Frank, have a cigarette.
- She did it to herself, Shep.

1:47:30.902 --> 1:47:32.862
She did it to herself.

1:47:40.454 --> 1:47:42.705
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

1:48:53.026 --> 1:48:57.154
They were such wonderful people.
Weren't they, Shep?

1:48:57.989 --> 1:49:02.701
It's just devastating. Poor April.

1:49:02.786 --> 1:49:04.119
Thank you.

1:49:05.330 --> 1:49:08.791
Frank lives in the city now.
Where is it that he works?

1:49:09.834 --> 1:49:12.336
- Bart Pollock Associates.
- Computers?

1:49:13.630 --> 1:49:15.548
Interesting firm.

1:49:15.632 --> 1:49:18.926
- Have you seen him since?
- No. Not back here.

1:49:19.010 --> 1:49:23.305
There are too many memories, I think.
Shep has seen him in the city.

1:49:23.390 --> 1:49:25.307
Haven't you, sweetie?

1:49:25.850 --> 1:49:28.978
Frank is just devoted to those kids.

1:49:29.854 --> 1:49:32.940
Every spare moment he has,
he spends with them.

1:49:48.123 --> 1:49:49.456
Excuse me.

1:50:00.719 --> 1:50:02.261
You all right?

1:50:07.642 --> 1:50:10.894
I don't want to talk
about the Wheelers any more.

1:50:12.439 --> 1:50:13.522
Okay.

1:50:15.817 --> 1:50:21.196
We don't have to.

1:51:03.323 --> 1:51:06.075
Daddy, Daddy, watch. Watch, Daddy.

1:51:12.082 --> 1:51:13.791
I can't tell you how pleased I am

1:51:13.875 --> 1:51:17.086
about the little Revolutionary Road
place, Howard.

1:51:17.504 --> 1:51:20.464
And now whenever I drive past,
it gives me such a lift

1:51:20.548 --> 1:51:24.176
to see it all perked up
and spanking clean again.

1:51:24.761 --> 1:51:27.179
All the lights in all the windows.

1:51:28.264 --> 1:51:32.476
And do you know? I was just thinking,
I've loved that little house for years.

1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:37.064
And the Braces are the only really
suitable people I've ever found for it.

1:51:37.649 --> 1:51:40.484
Really nice, congenial people, I mean.

1:51:40.568 --> 1:51:43.278
Well, except for the Wheelers,
you mean.

1:51:45.281 --> 1:51:47.700
I was very fond of the Wheelers.

1:51:48.535 --> 1:51:51.995
They were a bit whimsical for my taste.
A bit neurotic.

1:51:53.123 --> 1:51:54.456
I never stressed it, but they were often

1:51:54.541 --> 1:51:57.710
very trying people
to deal with, in many ways.

1:51:59.003 --> 1:52:03.799
And actually, the main reason
that the little house was so hard to sell

1:52:03.925 --> 1:52:07.052
was because they let it depreciate
so dreadfully.

1:52:07.137 --> 1:52:12.766
Warped window frames, wet cellar,
crayon marks all over the walls,

1:52:12.851 --> 1:52:15.351
filthy smudges around the door knobs
and the fixtures...
