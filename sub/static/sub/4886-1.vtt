00:17.392 --> 00:20.938
Long ago, in the far away land
of ancient Greece...

00:21.104 --> 00:23.815
there was a golden age
of powerful gods...

00:23.982 --> 00:26.652
and extraordinay heroes.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.780
And the greatest and strongest
of all these heroes...

00:29.947 --> 00:32.658
was the mighty Hercules.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.494
But what is the measure
of a true hero?

00:35.661 --> 00:37.746
Ah, that is what our stoy is...

00:37.913 --> 00:39.248
Will you listen to him?

00:39.414 --> 00:42.292
He's makin' the story
sound like some Greek tragedy.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.877
Lighten up, dude.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.004
We'll take it from here, darling.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.006
You go, girl.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.552
We are the muses...

00:51.718 --> 00:55.305
goddesses of the arts
and proclaimers of heroes.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.140
Heroes like Hercules.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.184
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules".

00:59.351 --> 01:01.562
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

01:01.728 --> 01:04.397
Our story actually begins...

01:04.565 --> 01:06.608
long before Hercules...

01:06.733 --> 01:08.819
many eons ago.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.487
Ah

01:10.654 --> 01:13.532
Back when the world was new

01:13.699 --> 01:16.368
- Whoa!
- The planet Earth was down on its luck

01:16.535 --> 01:22.791
And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok

01:22.958 --> 01:25.794
It was a nasty place

01:25.961 --> 01:28.547
There was a mess
wherever you stepped

01:28.714 --> 01:33.343
Where chaos reigned and earthquakes
and volcanoes never slept

01:33.510 --> 01:34.970
Whoo! Say it, girlfriend!

01:35.137 --> 01:36.555
And then along came Zeus

01:36.722 --> 01:39.516
- He hurled his thunderbolt
- He zapped

01:39.683 --> 01:43.061
- Locked those suckers in a vault
- They're trapped

01:43.228 --> 01:46.940
And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks

01:47.107 --> 01:48.567
And that's the gospel truth

01:48.734 --> 01:53.155
The guy was too "TypeA"
to just relax

01:53.322 --> 01:56.158
- And that's the world's first dish
- Yeah, baby.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.286
Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth

01:59.453 --> 02:02.122
Though, honey
it may seem impossible

02:02.247 --> 02:05.417
That's the gospel truth

02:05.584 --> 02:07.836
On Mount Olympus life was neat

02:08.002 --> 02:10.214
And smooth as sweet vermouth

02:11.173 --> 02:14.301
Although, honey
it may seem impossible

02:14.468 --> 02:20.807
That's the gospel truth

02:20.974 --> 02:24.770
- Ah, ah
- Ah

02:24.895 --> 02:28.941
- Ah, ah
- Oh, yeah, yeah

02:29.066 --> 02:32.986
- Ah, ah
- Hey, hey, hey

02:33.153 --> 02:37.157
- Ah, ah
- Hey, yeah

03:00.222 --> 03:02.266
Hercules!

03:03.642 --> 03:05.477
Behave yourself.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.191
Oh, look at this.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.818
Look how cute he is.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.450
Hah! Oh, he's strong...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.494
like his dad, hmm?

03:22.661 --> 03:24.496
Whoa! Excuse me!
Hot stuff coming through!

03:24.663 --> 03:26.748
Excuse me.
One side, Ares.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.419
Why, Hermes, they're lovely.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.838
Yeah, you know, I had Orpheus
do the arrangement.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.340
Isn't that too nutty?

03:35.507 --> 03:38.302
Fabulous party. You know, I haven't
seen this much love in a room...

03:38.468 --> 03:40.846
since Narcissus discovered himself.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.809
Dear, keep those
away from the baby.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.061
Oh, he won't hurt himself.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.606
Let the kid have a little fun.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.826
On behalf of my son,
I want to thank you all...

04:02.993 --> 04:05.871
for your wonderful gifts!

04:06.038 --> 04:07.664
What about our gift, dear?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.876
Well, let's see here.
We'll take... Hmm, yes.

04:11.043 --> 04:15.547
A little cirrus and, uh, hmm,
a touch of nimbostratus...

04:15.714 --> 04:19.134
and a dash of cumulus.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.266
His name is Pegasus...

04:26.433 --> 04:29.311
and he's all yours, son.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.741
Mind his head.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.701
He's so tiny.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.959
My boy.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.837
My little Hercules.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.422
How sentimental.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.176
You know, I haven't been
this choked up...

05:01.343 --> 05:04.096
since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat!

05:04.263 --> 05:06.557
Huh?

05:06.682 --> 05:08.559
So is this an audience
or a mosaic?

05:08.725 --> 05:11.061
Hey, how you doin'?
Lookin' good. Nice dress.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.730
So, Hades,
you finally made it.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.607
How are things
in the underworld?

05:15.774 --> 05:18.527
Well, they're just fine. You know,
a little dark, a little gloomy.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.863
And, as always,
hey, full of dead people.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.116
What are you gonna do? Ah!
There's the little sunspot.

05:24.283 --> 05:28.203
Little snootchie. And here is a sucker
for the little sucker.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.038
Eh? Here you go.
You just...

05:32.708 --> 05:34.251
Sheesh!

05:34.418 --> 05:36.545
Uh, powerful little tyke.

05:36.712 --> 05:40.090
Come on, Hades. Don't be such a stiff.
Join the celebration!

05:40.257 --> 05:42.634
Hey. Love to, babe...

05:42.801 --> 05:45.554
but unlike you gods
lounging about up here...

05:45.721 --> 05:48.056
I regrettably
have a full-time gig...

05:48.223 --> 05:51.685
that you, by the way,
so charitably bestowed on me, Zeus.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.147
So, can't.
Love to, but can't.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.984
You ought to slow down.
You'll work yourself to death.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.987
Hah! Work yourself to death!

06:04.323 --> 06:05.824
Oh, I kill myself!

06:06.825 --> 06:09.578
If only. If only.

06:09.745 --> 06:14.041
If there's one god you don't want
to get steamed up, it's Hades.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.752
'Cause he had an evil plan.

06:16.919 --> 06:21.381
He ran the underworld

06:21.548 --> 06:25.302
But thought the dead
were dull and uncouth

06:25.469 --> 06:28.764
He was as mean
as he was ruthless

06:28.931 --> 06:32.809
And that's the gospel truth

06:32.976 --> 06:37.606
He had a plan
to shake things up

06:37.773 --> 06:47.115
And that's the gospel truth

06:52.955 --> 06:54.581
Pain!

06:54.748 --> 06:57.668
Coming,
your most lugubriousness. Ow!

07:01.046 --> 07:04.633
- Panic!
- Oh, I'm sory. I can handle it!

07:12.349 --> 07:15.018
- Pain! Oh!
- And Panic!

07:15.185 --> 07:17.187
Reporting for duty!

07:17.354 --> 07:20.649
Fine, fine, fine. Just let me know
the instant the Fates arrive.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.526
Oh. They're here.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.029
What? The Fates are here,
and you didn't tell me?

07:27.281 --> 07:32.202
We are worms!
Worthless worms!

07:32.369 --> 07:35.873
Memo to me, memo to me:
maim you after my meeting.

07:39.126 --> 07:44.256
Darling, hold that mortal's
thread of life...

07:44.423 --> 07:46.758
good and tight.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.890
Incoming!

08:01.940 --> 08:04.276
Ladies.
I am so sorry that I'm...

08:04.443 --> 08:06.445
- Late!
- We knew you would be.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.697
We know eveything.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.949
- Past.
- Present.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.993
And future.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.038
Indoor plumbing.
It's gonna be big.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.707
Great, gr... Anyway, see, ladies, I
was at this party and I lost track of...

08:18.874 --> 08:22.669
- We know!
- Yeah. I know you know.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.839
So here's the deal. Zeus...

08:26.006 --> 08:29.885
Mr High and Mighty, Mr "Hey, You,
Get Off Of My Cloud",... now he has...

08:30.052 --> 08:33.222
- A bouncing baby brat.
- We know!

08:33.388 --> 08:36.099
I know you know!
I know. I got it.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.602
I got the concept.
So let me just ask:

08:38.769 --> 08:41.813
is this kid gonna mess up
my hostile takeover bid, or what?

08:41.980 --> 08:44.441
- What do you think?
- Oh, no you don't.

08:44.608 --> 08:47.903
We're not supposed
to reveal the future.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.614
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Time out. Can I...

08:50.781 --> 08:52.491
Can I ask you a question by the way?
Are you...

08:52.658 --> 08:54.952
Did you cut your hair or something?
You look fabulous.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.454
I mean, you look like a Fate
worse than death.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.208
Oh, gross!

09:01.375 --> 09:03.418
Yech! It's blinkin'!

09:05.504 --> 09:09.216
Ladies, please.
My fate...

09:09.383 --> 09:11.468
is in your lovely hands.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.304
- Oh.
- Oh, all right.

09:17.140 --> 09:21.603
In 18 years precisely...

09:21.770 --> 09:24.231
the planets will align...

09:24.398 --> 09:27.526
ever so nicely.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.777
Ay, verse. Oy.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.488
The time to act
will be at hand.

09:31.655 --> 09:35.868
Unleash the Titans,
your monstrous band.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.369
Mm-hmm. Good, good.

09:37.536 --> 09:42.791
Then the once-proud Zeus
will finally fall...

09:42.958 --> 09:45.919
and you, Hades...

09:46.086 --> 09:49.089
will rule all!

09:49.256 --> 09:51.800
Yes! Hades rules!

09:51.967 --> 09:56.138
- A word of caution to this tale.
- Excuse me?

09:56.305 --> 10:00.934
Should Hercules fight,
you will fail.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.941
What?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.819
Okay, fine, fine.
I'm cool. I'm fine.

10:12.529 --> 10:16.074
Pain? Panic?
Got a little riddle for ya.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.369
How do you kill a god?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.121
I do not know!

10:21.288 --> 10:22.915
You can't. They're immortal?

10:23.081 --> 10:24.750
Bingo! They're immortal!

10:24.917 --> 10:29.546
So, first you got to turn
the little sunspot...

10:29.713 --> 10:31.548
mortal.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.788
- Huh?
- Wha... What is it?

11:02.955 --> 11:04.748
The baby!

11:10.337 --> 11:14.383
Hercules! Oh!

11:16.802 --> 11:22.432
No!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.017
Now we did it!

11:24.184 --> 11:26.270
Zeus is gonna use us
for target practice!

11:26.436 --> 11:28.564
Just hang on to the kid, Panic!

11:32.526 --> 11:35.612
Hurry! Let's just kill the kid
and get it over with, okay?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.907
Here you go, kid.
A little Grecian formula.

11:40.534 --> 11:44.371
Look at that! He's changing.
Can we do it now?

11:44.538 --> 11:47.666
No, no, no. He has to drink
the whole potion.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.919
- Evey last drop!
- Who's there?

11:56.550 --> 11:58.760
Alcmene, over here.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.848
Oh, you poor thing.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.892
- Oh, don't cy.
- Is anybody there?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.269
- Now?
- Now.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.732
Oh. Well, he must
have been abandoned.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.401
Amphityon, for so many years...

12:14.568 --> 12:17.821
we've prayed to the gods
to bless us with a child.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.240
Perhaps they've answered
our prayers.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.909
Perhaps they have.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.952
"Hercules"?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.724
Help, help, help!

12:45.891 --> 12:48.143
Hades is gonna kill us
when he finds out what happened.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.896
You mean, if he finds out.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.440
Of course he's gonna f...

12:53.607 --> 12:56.485
If. If is good.

12:57.569 --> 13:02.241
It was tragic. Zeus led all the gods
on a frantic search.

13:02.407 --> 13:06.286
But by the time they found the baby,
it was too late.

13:06.453 --> 13:11.083
- Young Herc was mortal now
- Mmm

13:11.250 --> 13:14.795
But since he did not drink
the last drop

13:14.962 --> 13:18.048
He still retained
his godlike strength

13:18.215 --> 13:22.761
- So thank his lucky stars
- Tell it, girl.

13:22.928 --> 13:27.766
- But Zeus and Hera wept
- Ooh, ooh, ooh

13:27.933 --> 13:31.562
Because their son
could never come home

13:31.728 --> 13:34.314
They'd have to watch
their precious baby

13:34.481 --> 13:38.443
Grow up from a far

13:38.610 --> 13:43.532
Though Hades' horrid plan

13:43.699 --> 13:46.910
Was hatched before Herc
cut his first tooth

13:47.077 --> 13:51.248
- Ahh
- The boy grew stronger everyday

13:51.415 --> 13:55.544
And that's the gospel truth

13:55.711 --> 14:03.552
The gospel truth

14:13.145 --> 14:15.272
Hercules, slow down!

14:19.109 --> 14:21.278
Look out!

14:21.445 --> 14:23.113
Oops! S-S-sorry, guys!

14:23.280 --> 14:25.449
- Hey, watch where you're goin'!
- Sunday driver!

14:29.953 --> 14:31.622
Thanks, son.

14:31.788 --> 14:35.417
When old Penelope twisted her ankle
back there, I thought we were done for.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.795
- No problem, Pop.
- Uh, don't-don't-don't unload just yet.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.839
First, I have to finagle
with Phideas.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.341
Okay.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.552
Oops. sorry, Penelope.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.972
Now, Hercules, this time,
please just...

14:49.139 --> 14:51.266
I know, I know.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.810
Stay by the cart.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.812
That's my boy.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.485
Oh, my goodness. Whoa!

15:01.652 --> 15:03.320
Careful!

15:04.488 --> 15:06.865
- Why, thank you.
- No problem.

15:07.032 --> 15:10.327
Why, Hercules! I-I-It's you!

15:10.494 --> 15:14.122
- Let me, let me help you with that.
- No, no, no, no, no. I got it!

15:14.289 --> 15:16.250
I'm fine.
You just run along.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.085
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yes.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.128
Absolutely.

15:23.882 --> 15:26.176
Yo! Give it here!

15:26.343 --> 15:28.220
Hey, you need an extra guy?

15:29.471 --> 15:31.640
Uh, sorry, Herc.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.351
Uh, we already got five...

15:34.518 --> 15:36.270
and we want to keep it
an even number.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.772
- Hey, wait a second. Five isn't an ev...
- See ya, Herc.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.608
- What a geek!
- Destructo Boy.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.319
- Maybe we should call him "Jerkules".
- Yeah!

15:51.201 --> 15:52.744
Heads up!

15:52.911 --> 15:54.830
- I-I got it!
- No! Stop!

15:58.125 --> 16:01.170
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.006
It's okay.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.015
Hey! Whoa!

16:18.896 --> 16:21.815
- Son!
- Hang on, Pop! Be right back!

16:21.982 --> 16:24.818
Oh, my! Oh, no! Don't!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

16:24.985 --> 16:27.446
No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:32.951 --> 16:34.620
Watch out!

16:49.968 --> 16:53.305
Nice catch, Jerkules.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.225
Son.

16:56.391 --> 17:01.355
This is the last straw,
Amphityon!

17:01.522 --> 17:03.023
That boy is a menace!

17:03.190 --> 17:06.068
He's too dangerous
to be around normal people!

17:07.653 --> 17:09.905
He didn't mean any harm.
He's just a kid.

17:10.071 --> 17:14.034
He-He just can't control
his strength.

17:14.201 --> 17:18.497
I'm warning you.
You keep that-that-that...

17:18.664 --> 17:20.249
freak away from here!

17:20.415 --> 17:22.626
Freak! Yeah, go away!

17:36.014 --> 17:40.227
Son, you shouldn't let those things
they said back there get to ya.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.980
But, Pop, they're right.
I-I am a freak.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.358
I-I try to fit in.
I really do.

17:46.525 --> 17:48.110
I just can't.

17:49.528 --> 17:52.948
Sometimes I feel like...

17:53.115 --> 17:55.826
like I really
don't belong here...

17:55.993 --> 18:00.789
like I'm supposed to be
someplace else.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.000
Hercules, son...

18:03.166 --> 18:05.002
I know it doesn't make any sense.

18:15.888 --> 18:18.599
I have often dreamed

18:18.724 --> 18:20.934
Of a far-offplace

18:21.101 --> 18:26.607
Where a great, warm welcome
will be waiting for me

18:26.773 --> 18:28.942
Where the crowds will cheer

18:29.109 --> 18:31.778
When they see my face

18:31.904 --> 18:37.492
And a voice keeps sayin'
this is where I'm meant to be

18:38.619 --> 18:41.288
I will find my way

18:41.455 --> 18:43.457
I can go the distance

18:43.624 --> 18:46.585
I'll be there someday

18:46.752 --> 18:49.004
If I can be strong

18:49.171 --> 18:51.590
I know every mile

18:51.757 --> 18:54.468
Will be worth my while

18:55.802 --> 19:02.601
I would go most anywhere
to feel like I

19:02.726 --> 19:06.897
Belong

19:10.275 --> 19:13.278
Hercules, there's something
your mother and I...

19:13.445 --> 19:17.157
have been meaning to, to tell ya.

19:17.324 --> 19:21.328
But if you found me,
then where did I come from?

19:21.495 --> 19:23.914
Why was I left here?

19:24.081 --> 19:28.627
This was around your neck
when we found you.

19:30.963 --> 19:32.881
It's the symbol of the gods.

19:33.048 --> 19:36.593
This is it! Don't you see?
Maybe they have the answers.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.887
I'll go to the temple of Zeus and...

19:41.557 --> 19:44.893
Ma, Pop...

19:45.060 --> 19:49.565
you're the greatest parents
anyone could have, but...

19:49.731 --> 19:51.567
I-I gotta know.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.963
I am on my way

20:13.130 --> 20:15.132
I can go the distance

20:15.299 --> 20:17.885
I don't care how far

20:18.051 --> 20:20.304
Somehow, I'll be strong

20:20.470 --> 20:22.723
I know every mile

20:22.890 --> 20:26.435
Will be worth my while

20:26.602 --> 20:29.521
I would go most anywhere

20:29.688 --> 20:35.527
To find where I belong

20:54.671 --> 20:56.715
Oh, mighty Zeus...

20:56.882 --> 21:01.094
please, hear me
and, and answer my prayer.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.348
I need to know:
Who am I?

21:04.515 --> 21:06.975
Wh-Where do I belong?

21:13.065 --> 21:14.942
Huh?

21:20.239 --> 21:24.701
My boy.
My little Hercules.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.790
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold on, kiddo!

21:29.915 --> 21:32.167
What's your hurry?
After all these years...

21:32.334 --> 21:35.796
is this the kind of hello
you give your father?

21:35.921 --> 21:37.548
F-F-Father?

21:37.714 --> 21:40.676
Didn't know you had
a famous father, did you?

21:40.843 --> 21:42.678
Surprise!

21:43.846 --> 21:45.848
Look how you've grown.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.684
Why, you've got your mother's
beautiful eyes...

21:48.809 --> 21:50.936
and my strong chin.

21:51.103 --> 21:53.939
- Hah!
- I-I don't understand.

21:54.106 --> 21:57.985
If you're my father,
that would make me a...

21:58.151 --> 21:59.528
A god.

21:59.695 --> 22:02.197
A god. A god!

22:02.364 --> 22:04.825
Hey, you wanted answers,
and by thunder...

22:04.992 --> 22:07.578
you're old enough now
to know the truth.

22:07.744 --> 22:11.331
But why did you leave me on Earth?
Didn't you want me?

22:11.456 --> 22:16.086
Of course we did. Your mother and I
loved you with all our hearts.

22:16.253 --> 22:19.798
But someone stole you from us
and turned you mortal...

22:19.965 --> 22:23.218
and only gods
can live on Mount Olympus.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.845
And you can't do a thing?

22:25.012 --> 22:26.972
I can't, Hercules,
but you can.

22:27.097 --> 22:30.142
R-Really? W-What?
I'll do anything.

22:30.309 --> 22:33.520
Hercules, if you can prove yourself
a true hero on Earth...

22:33.687 --> 22:35.647
your godhood
will be restored.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.650
A true hero. Great!

22:38.817 --> 22:42.237
Uh, exactly how do you become
a true hero?

22:42.404 --> 22:46.783
First, you must seek out Philoctetes,
the trainer of heroes.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.745
Seek out Philoctetes.
Right. I'll...

22:49.912 --> 22:51.997
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Hold your horses!

22:52.164 --> 22:53.999
Which reminds me.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.342
Ha-ha! You probably
don't remember Pegasus...

23:03.509 --> 23:06.094
but you two go way back, son.

23:13.936 --> 23:15.896
Oh, Pegasus!

23:16.063 --> 23:17.981
He's a magnificent horse...

23:18.148 --> 23:20.567
with the brain of a bird.

23:23.195 --> 23:26.114
I'll find Philoctetes,
become a true hero!

23:26.281 --> 23:27.533
That's the spirit!

23:27.699 --> 23:31.995
I won't let you down, Father!
Yee-hah!

23:32.162 --> 23:34.206
Good luck, son.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.503
I will beat the odds

23:39.670 --> 23:41.505
I can go the distance

23:41.672 --> 23:43.924
I will face the world

23:44.091 --> 23:46.051
Fearless, proud and strong

23:46.218 --> 23:48.470
I will please the gods

23:48.637 --> 23:50.472
I can go the distance

23:50.639 --> 23:53.100
Till I find my hero's welcome

23:53.267 --> 23:56.395
Right where I

23:56.562 --> 24:09.199
Belong

24:31.638 --> 24:33.265
Whoa!

24:35.434 --> 24:37.769
- You sure
this is the right place?

24:49.031 --> 24:50.866
- What's the matter, little guy?
You stuck?

24:51.033 --> 24:55.204
- Whoa! Hey, butt out, buddy!
- Ugh!

24:55.370 --> 24:57.873
Girls! Stop! Stop!
Come back! Come back, come back!

24:58.040 --> 25:01.001
Whoa, whoa! Oh, jeez!

25:01.168 --> 25:04.796
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, nymphs!

25:04.963 --> 25:07.633
- They can't keep their hands off me.
- Hey!

25:11.845 --> 25:13.889
What's the matter?
You never seen a satyr before?

25:14.056 --> 25:16.725
Uh, no.
Can you help us?

25:16.850 --> 25:21.563
We're looking for someone
called Philoctetes.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.565
- Call me Phil.
- Phil!

25:23.732 --> 25:26.068
- Ow!
- Boy, am I glad to meet you!

25:26.235 --> 25:29.363
I'm Hercules,
and this is Pegasus.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.825
Animals. Disgusting.

25:33.951 --> 25:37.162
I need your help.
I want to become a hero, a true hero.

25:39.081 --> 25:41.166
sorry, kid.
Can't help ya.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.043
- Wait.
- Whoo!

25:43.210 --> 25:45.128
Uh, sorry. Why not?

25:45.295 --> 25:48.757
Two words: I am retired.

25:50.008 --> 25:51.718
Look, I gotta do this.

25:51.885 --> 25:53.720
Haven't you ever had a dream...

25:53.887 --> 25:56.473
something you wanted so bad
you'd do anything?

25:59.226 --> 26:02.437
Kid, come inside.
I want to show you somethin'.

26:10.946 --> 26:13.907
Watch it! That was part
of the mast of the Argo.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.701
- The Argo?
- Yeah.

26:15.868 --> 26:19.371
Who do you think taught Jason
how to sail? Cleopatra?

26:19.538 --> 26:21.957
I trained
all those would-be heroes.

26:22.124 --> 26:26.879
Odysseus, Perseus, Theseus.
A lot of "yeuseus".

26:27.045 --> 26:29.548
And every single one
of those bums let me down...

26:29.715 --> 26:31.466
flatter than a discus.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.553
None of'em
could go the distance.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.514
And then there was Achilles.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.516
Now there was a guy
who had it all...

26:39.683 --> 26:41.518
the build, the foot speed.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.604
He could jab.
He could take a hit.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.148
He could keep on comin'.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.859
But that furshlugginer
heel of his!

26:49.026 --> 26:53.822
He barely gets nicked there once
and kaboom! He's history.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.701
Yeah, I had a dream once.

26:57.868 --> 27:01.246
I dreamed I was gonna train
the greatest hero there ever was.

27:01.413 --> 27:05.542
So great, the gods would hang
a picture of him in the stars...

27:05.709 --> 27:07.211
all across the sky...

27:07.377 --> 27:11.006
and people would say,
"That's Phil's boy".

27:11.173 --> 27:13.091
That's right.

27:13.258 --> 27:15.135
Eh, but dreams are for rookies.

27:15.302 --> 27:17.179
A guy can only take
so much disappointment.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.389
But I'm different
than those other guys, Phil.

27:19.556 --> 27:23.644
I can go the distance.
Come on. I'll show ya.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.771
Jeez. You don't give up, do ya?

27:25.938 --> 27:28.190
Watch this.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.529
Holy Hera.

27:33.695 --> 27:37.032
You know, maybe if I...
No! Snap out of it!

27:37.199 --> 27:39.243
I'm too old to get mixed up
in this stuff again.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.078
But if I don't become
a true hero...

27:41.245 --> 27:44.248
I'll never be able
to rejoin my father Zeus.

27:44.414 --> 27:47.417
Hold it.
Zeus is your father, right?

27:47.584 --> 27:49.419
Uh-huh.

27:49.586 --> 27:53.048
Zeus, the big guy.
He's your daddy.

27:53.215 --> 27:57.135
Mr. Lightning Bolts!
Read me a book, would ya, Da-Da?

27:57.302 --> 28:00.138
Zeus!
"Once upon a time..."

28:00.305 --> 28:02.891
- It's the truth!
- Please!

28:05.477 --> 28:07.604
So you wanna be a hero, kid

28:07.771 --> 28:10.732
Well, whoop-de-do

28:10.899 --> 28:12.901
I have been
around the block before

28:13.068 --> 28:15.362
With blockheads just like you

28:15.529 --> 28:17.739
Each and everyone
a disappointment

28:17.906 --> 28:21.368
Pain for which
there ain't no ointment

28:21.535 --> 28:24.997
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus is

28:25.163 --> 28:28.458
Askin 'me to jump
into the fray

28:28.625 --> 28:31.336
My answer is two words

28:34.464 --> 28:35.799
Okay.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.301
You mean you'll do it?

28:37.467 --> 28:39.428
- You win.
- You won't be sorry, Phil.

28:39.595 --> 28:41.847
- Oh, gods.
- So when do we start? Can we start now?

28:42.014 --> 28:43.849
Oy, vay.

28:45.017 --> 28:47.853
I'd given up hope
that someone would come

28:48.020 --> 28:49.646
Along

28:49.813 --> 28:52.107
A fella who'd ring the bell
for once

28:52.274 --> 28:54.401
Not the gong

28:54.568 --> 28:56.820
The kind who wins trophies

28:56.987 --> 28:59.281
Won't settle for low fees

28:59.448 --> 29:01.200
At least semipro fees

29:01.366 --> 29:04.244
But, no
I get the greenhorn

29:04.411 --> 29:08.707
I've been out to pasture, pal
My ambition gone

29:08.874 --> 29:13.545
Content to spend lazy days
and to graze my lawn

29:13.712 --> 29:16.048
But you need an advisor

29:16.215 --> 29:18.467
A satyr, but wiser

29:18.634 --> 29:22.262
A good merchandiser
and... whoa

29:22.429 --> 29:26.225
There goes my ulcer
I'm down to one last hope, and I hope

29:26.391 --> 29:28.185
It's you

29:28.352 --> 29:32.981
Though, kid, you're not
exactly a dream come true

29:33.148 --> 29:35.275
It rained enough turkeys

29:35.442 --> 29:37.736
- Who nevercame through
- Whoa!

29:37.903 --> 29:40.489
You're my one last hope
so you'll have to do

29:41.740 --> 29:45.452
Rule number six:
when rescuing a damsel...

29:45.619 --> 29:47.579
always handle with care.

29:49.498 --> 29:51.333
No!

29:52.668 --> 29:55.420
Rule number 95, kid: concentrate!

29:57.631 --> 29:59.883
Rule number 96:

30:00.050 --> 30:02.094
aim!

30:02.261 --> 30:04.388
Demigods have faced the odds

30:04.555 --> 30:06.765
And ended up a mockey

30:06.932 --> 30:08.475
Don't believe the stories

30:08.642 --> 30:11.979
That you read
on all the crockey

30:12.145 --> 30:16.483
To be a true hero, kid
is a dyin' art

30:16.650 --> 30:19.194
Like paintin' a masterpiece

30:19.361 --> 30:21.321
It's a work of heart

30:21.488 --> 30:23.657
It takes more than sinew

30:23.824 --> 30:26.201
Comes down to what's in you

30:26.368 --> 30:29.997
You have to continue to grow

30:30.163 --> 30:32.207
Now that's more like it!

30:32.374 --> 30:34.793
I'm down to one lastshot

30:34.960 --> 30:38.630
And my last high note

30:38.797 --> 30:43.969
Before that blasted underworld
gets my goat

30:44.136 --> 30:45.888
My dreams are on you, kid

30:46.054 --> 30:48.140
Go make 'em come true

30:48.307 --> 30:50.058
Climb that uphill slope

30:50.225 --> 30:52.644
Keep pushin 'that envelope

30:52.811 --> 30:54.479
You're my one last hope

30:54.646 --> 30:57.900
And, kid, it's up to

30:58.066 --> 31:01.904
You

31:02.070 --> 31:03.614
Yeah!

31:06.158 --> 31:08.035
Did you see that?

31:08.202 --> 31:11.496
Next stop, Olympus.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.540
All right.
Just take it easy, champ.

31:13.707 --> 31:15.709
I am ready.
I want to get off this island.

31:15.876 --> 31:18.337
I want to see battles
and monsters.

31:18.504 --> 31:20.339
Rescue some damsels.

31:20.506 --> 31:22.591
You know, heroic stuff.

31:22.758 --> 31:26.053
- Well.
- Aw, come on, Phil!

31:26.220 --> 31:29.556
Well, okay, okay.
You want a road test? Saddle up, kid.

31:29.723 --> 31:33.185
- We're goin' to Thebes!
- Ya-hoo!

31:33.352 --> 31:35.938
- So what's in Thebes?
- A lot of problems.

31:36.104 --> 31:39.107
It's a big, tough town.
Good place to start buildin' a rep.

31:41.777 --> 31:43.320
Sounds like your basic DID...

31:43.487 --> 31:46.281
- Hyah!
- Damsel in distress!

31:52.955 --> 31:55.374
Not so fast, sweetheart.

31:55.541 --> 31:57.876
I swear, Nessus.
Put me down or I'll...

31:58.043 --> 32:01.755
Whoo!
I like 'em fiey!

32:01.922 --> 32:04.842
Now remember, kid.
First, analyse the situation.

32:05.008 --> 32:08.846
Don't just barrel in there
without thinking. Eh?

32:10.055 --> 32:11.640
He's losin' points for this!

32:11.807 --> 32:14.142
- You don't know what you're...
- Halt!

32:16.770 --> 32:19.481
Step aside, two legs.

32:19.648 --> 32:23.235
Pardon me, my good, uh, uh, sir.

32:23.402 --> 32:25.237
I'll have to ask you to release
that young...

32:25.404 --> 32:28.156
- Keep movin', junior.
- Lady.

32:28.323 --> 32:31.869
But you... Are-Aren't you
a damsel in distress?

32:32.035 --> 32:35.080
I'm a damsel.
I'm in distress.

32:35.247 --> 32:38.166
I can handle this.
Have a nice day.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.169
Uh...

32:40.335 --> 32:43.338
Ma'am, I'm afraid you may be too close
to the situation to realize...

32:45.090 --> 32:48.552
Ohhh! What are you doin'?
Get your sword!

32:48.719 --> 32:53.348
Sword. Right, right. Rule number 15:
a hero is only as good as his weapon!

33:01.190 --> 33:04.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Hold on!
He's gotta do it on his own.

33:04.484 --> 33:07.487
Come on, kid!
Concentrate!

33:07.654 --> 33:09.198
Use your head!

33:10.532 --> 33:12.034
Oh.

33:16.788 --> 33:19.708
All right!
Not bad, kid!

33:19.875 --> 33:22.377
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but not bad.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.925
Oh, gee, miss.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.219
- Oh.
- That was dumb.

33:30.385 --> 33:31.720
Yeah.

33:32.888 --> 33:34.306
Excuse me.

33:39.895 --> 33:43.023
Nice work! Excelente.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.234
Is Wonderboy here for real?

33:45.400 --> 33:49.321
What are you talkin' about?
Of course he's real. Whoa!

33:50.489 --> 33:55.077
And by the way, sweet cheeks.
I'm real too.

33:55.244 --> 33:56.745
Ugh!

33:56.912 --> 33:59.998
Yee-hah! Ya-hoo!

34:06.171 --> 34:07.965
Whoa!

34:34.283 --> 34:36.201
- How was that, Phil?
- Reign it in, rookie.

34:36.368 --> 34:39.204
You can get away with mistakes
like those in the minor decathlons...

34:39.371 --> 34:41.956
but this is the big leagues!

34:42.123 --> 34:43.833
At least I beat him, didn't I?

34:44.001 --> 34:47.462
Next time, don't let your guard down
because of a pair of big goo-goo eyes!

34:47.629 --> 34:50.299
D-oh! It's like I keep tellin' ya.

34:50.424 --> 34:53.217
You gotta stay focused,
and you...

35:02.603 --> 35:05.772
Are you, uh, all right,
Miss, uh...

35:05.939 --> 35:07.858
Megara.
My friends call me Meg.

35:08.025 --> 35:09.860
At least they would
if I had any friends.

35:10.027 --> 35:14.489
So did they give you a name
along with all those rippling pectorals?

35:14.656 --> 35:18.535
Uh, uh, uh, I'm, um, uh...

35:18.702 --> 35:21.121
- Uh, uh...
- Are you always this articulate?

35:21.288 --> 35:24.208
Hercules. My...
My name is Hercules.

35:25.417 --> 35:28.587
Herc... Huh.
I think I prefer Wonderboy.

35:28.754 --> 35:32.883
So, uh, uh... How-how-how'd you
get mixed up with the, uh...

35:33.050 --> 35:35.469
Pinhead with hooves?
Well, you know how men are.

35:35.636 --> 35:39.515
They think "No" means "Yes" and
"Get lost" means "Take me. I'm yours".

35:42.059 --> 35:45.437
Don't wory. Shorty here
can explain it to ya later.

35:45.604 --> 35:47.773
Well, thanks for everything, Herc.

35:47.940 --> 35:50.734
It's been a real slice.

35:50.901 --> 35:53.987
Wait! Um, can we give you a ride?

35:57.241 --> 36:00.827
Uh, I don't think your pinto
likes me very much.

36:00.994 --> 36:03.664
Pegasus? Oh, no.
Don't be silly.

36:03.830 --> 36:06.542
He'd be more than happy to... Ow!

36:08.335 --> 36:11.046
I'll be all right.
I'm a big tough girl.

36:11.213 --> 36:13.340
I tie my own sandals
and everything.

36:15.634 --> 36:17.052
Bye-bye, Wonderboy.

36:18.262 --> 36:20.722
Bye.

36:20.889 --> 36:24.017
She's somethin'.
Isn't she, Phil?

36:24.184 --> 36:26.895
Yeah, ye... Oh, yeah.
She's really somethin'.

36:27.062 --> 36:30.107
A real pain in the patella!
Earth to Herc!

36:30.274 --> 36:31.692
Come in, Herc!
Come in, Herc!

36:31.817 --> 36:34.403
We got a job to do, remember?

36:34.570 --> 36:36.280
Thebes is still waitin'.

36:36.446 --> 36:38.824
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

36:50.294 --> 36:52.087
Aw, how cute.

36:52.254 --> 36:55.007
A couple of rodents
lookin' for a theme park.

36:55.174 --> 36:56.884
Who you callin' a rodent, sister?

36:57.009 --> 36:59.970
- I'm a bunny!
- A-And I'm his gopher!

37:00.137 --> 37:02.055
Ta-dah!

37:02.222 --> 37:04.474
I thought I smelled a rat.

37:04.641 --> 37:07.561
- Meg.
- Speak of the devil.

37:07.728 --> 37:11.773
Meg, my little flower, my little bird,
my little nut. Meg.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.775
What exactly happened here?

37:13.942 --> 37:16.612
I thought you were gonna persuade
the river guardian to join my team...

37:16.778 --> 37:20.365
for the uprising, and here I am,
kind of river guardian-less.

37:20.532 --> 37:24.536
I gave it my best shot, but
he made me an offer I had to refuse.

37:24.703 --> 37:26.997
Fine. So instead of subtracting
two years from your sentence...

37:27.164 --> 37:29.124
hey, I'm gonna add two on, okay?

37:29.291 --> 37:31.376
- Give that your best shot.
- Look. It wasn't my fault.

37:31.543 --> 37:34.213
It was this wonderboy, Hercules.

37:34.379 --> 37:37.799
Hercules.
Why does that name ring a bell?

37:37.966 --> 37:40.802
I don't know.
Um, maybe we owe him money?

37:40.969 --> 37:45.516
- What was that name again?
- Hercules.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.559
He comes on with this big,
innocent farm boy routine...

37:47.726 --> 37:49.603
but I could see through that
in a Peloponnesian minute.

37:49.770 --> 37:53.649
Wait a minute. Wasn't Hercules the name
of that kid we were supposed to...

37:53.815 --> 37:57.110
Oh, my gods!
Run for it!

37:57.277 --> 38:00.614
So you took care of him, huh?

38:00.781 --> 38:02.699
Dead as a doornail.

38:02.866 --> 38:05.702
Weren't those your exact words?

38:05.827 --> 38:07.579
This might be
a different Hercules.

38:07.746 --> 38:11.416
Yeah! I mean, Hercules
is a very popular name nowadays!

38:11.583 --> 38:14.920
Remember, like, a few years ago,
every other boy was named Jason...

38:15.045 --> 38:16.588
and the girls
were all named Brittany?

38:16.755 --> 38:21.343
I'm about to rearrange
the cosmos...

38:21.468 --> 38:24.805
and the one schlemiel
who can louse it up...

38:24.972 --> 38:28.267
is waltzing around in the woods!

38:32.688 --> 38:34.398
Wait. Wait, big guy.

38:34.565 --> 38:37.401
- We can still cut in on his waltzing.
- That's right.

38:37.568 --> 38:40.279
And-And at least we made him mortal.
That's a good thing.

38:40.404 --> 38:41.780
Didn't we?

38:41.947 --> 38:45.200
Hmm. Fortunately
for the three of you...

38:45.367 --> 38:49.204
we still have time to correct
this rather egregious oversight.

38:49.371 --> 38:53.000
And this time, no foul-ups.

38:55.836 --> 38:58.505
Wow!

38:58.672 --> 39:02.176
- Is that all one town?
- One town, a million troubles.

39:02.301 --> 39:04.052
The one and only Thebes.

39:04.219 --> 39:06.471
The Big Olive itself.

39:06.638 --> 39:09.474
If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere.

39:16.899 --> 39:19.818
Stick with me, kid.
The city is a dangerous place.

39:21.612 --> 39:25.365
- Look where you're goin', numbskull!
- Hey, I'm walkin' here!

39:25.532 --> 39:27.826
See what I mean?
I'm tellin' you. Wackos.

39:27.993 --> 39:31.288
Pita bread. Pita bread.
Get your pita bread here.

39:31.455 --> 39:34.166
- Hey, Mack.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:34.291 --> 39:36.251
You wanna buy a sundial?

39:36.376 --> 39:38.420
He's not interested, all right?
Come on, kid.

39:38.587 --> 39:41.715
The end is coming!
Can't you feel it?

39:41.882 --> 39:44.593
Yes, yes.
Thank you for the info. Yes.

39:44.718 --> 39:47.095
We'll ponder that for awhile.
Just stare at the sidewalk.

39:47.262 --> 39:48.597
Come on.
Don't make eye contact.

39:48.722 --> 39:52.226
People here are nuts. That's because
they live in a city of turmoil.

39:52.351 --> 39:55.187
Trust me, kid. You're gonna be
just what the doctor ordered.

39:56.855 --> 40:01.276
It was tragic!
We lost everything in the fire.

40:01.401 --> 40:05.614
everything
except old Snowball here.

40:05.739 --> 40:08.450
Now were the fires
before or after the earthquake?

40:08.534 --> 40:10.410
They were after the earthquake.
I remember.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.037
But before the flood.

40:12.162 --> 40:15.374
Don't even get me started
on the crime rate.

40:15.541 --> 40:19.211
Thebes has certainly
gone downhill in a hurry.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.004
Tell me about it.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.131
It seems like every time
I turn around...

40:23.298 --> 40:25.342
there's some new monster
wreakin' havoc and I...

40:25.509 --> 40:28.637
All we need now
is a plague of locusts.

40:31.181 --> 40:34.017
That's it!
I'm movin' to Sparta!

40:34.184 --> 40:36.603
Excuse me.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.438
It, uh...

40:38.605 --> 40:42.234
seems to me that
what you folks need is a hero.

40:43.610 --> 40:45.487
Yeah, and who are you?

40:47.614 --> 40:49.783
I'm Hercules, and, uh...

40:49.950 --> 40:52.202
I happen to be a hero.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.581
- Is that so?
- A hero!

40:55.747 --> 40:58.000
Have you ever saved
a town before?

40:58.166 --> 41:00.419
Uh, no. Uh, not exactly, but I...

41:00.586 --> 41:03.005
Have you ever reversed
a natural disaster?

41:03.172 --> 41:05.424
Well, uh, no.

41:05.591 --> 41:09.428
Oh, listen to thi... He's just another
chariot chaser. This we need.

41:09.595 --> 41:10.929
That's a laugh.

41:11.096 --> 41:13.515
- Don't you pea brains get it?
- Hmm?

41:13.682 --> 41:15.642
This kid is the genuine article.

41:15.767 --> 41:20.022
Hey, isn't that the goat-man
who trained Achilles?

41:20.189 --> 41:21.732
Watch it, pal.

41:21.857 --> 41:26.361
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, uh, nice job on those heels!

41:26.528 --> 41:29.031
Ya missed a spot!

41:29.156 --> 41:31.283
You... I got your heel
right here!

41:31.408 --> 41:33.660
I'll wipe that stupid grin
off your face! You...

41:33.827 --> 41:36.705
Hey, Phil! Phil! Phil!

41:36.872 --> 41:39.625
What are you, crazy? Sheesh.

41:39.750 --> 41:43.378
Young man, we need
a professional hero...

41:43.545 --> 41:45.964
not an amateur.

41:46.798 --> 41:48.842
Well, wait. Stop!

41:53.847 --> 41:55.974
How am I supposed
to prove myself a hero...

41:56.099 --> 41:57.809
if nobody
will give me a chance?

41:57.976 --> 41:59.311
You'll get your chance.

41:59.478 --> 42:03.273
You just need some kind
of catastrophe or disaster.

42:03.398 --> 42:07.027
Please. Help! Please!
There's been a terrible accident!

42:07.194 --> 42:09.530
- Meg?
- Speakin' of disasters.

42:09.655 --> 42:12.241
Wonderboy! Hercules!

42:12.407 --> 42:14.201
- Thank goodness.
- Wha-Wha-What's wrong?

42:14.368 --> 42:15.702
Oh! Outside of town.

42:15.869 --> 42:18.080
Two little boys.
Th-They were playing in the gorge.

42:18.247 --> 42:20.791
Th-There was this rock slide,
a terrible rock slide.

42:20.958 --> 42:23.669
- They're trapped!
- Kids? Trapped?

42:23.836 --> 42:25.379
Phil, this is great!

42:25.546 --> 42:27.381
You're really choked up
about this, aren't ya?

42:27.548 --> 42:29.675
- Come on!
- No, I... You don't under...

42:29.800 --> 42:32.928
I, I have this terrible fear
of heights!

42:38.141 --> 42:40.853
I'm right behind ya, kid! Whoo!

42:40.936 --> 42:43.689
I'm way behind ya, kid.

42:43.856 --> 42:45.274
I got a fur wedgie.

42:52.197 --> 42:53.949
- Are you okay?
- I'll be fine.

42:54.116 --> 42:56.201
Just get me down
before I ruin the upholstey.

42:56.368 --> 42:58.245
Help! I can't breathe!

42:58.412 --> 43:00.330
- Hurry!
- Get us out!

43:00.497 --> 43:02.916
We're suffocating!

43:03.083 --> 43:06.211
Somebody call IX-I-I!

43:06.378 --> 43:08.005
Easy, fellas.
You'll be all right.

43:08.172 --> 43:09.756
We can't last much longer!

43:09.923 --> 43:12.426
Get us out before we get crushed!

43:31.570 --> 43:33.572
- How you boys doin'?
- We're okay now.

43:33.739 --> 43:37.367
Jeepers, mister.
You're really strong.

43:37.534 --> 43:41.038
Well, just ty to be a little
more careful next time, okay, kids?

43:41.205 --> 43:44.082
We sure will.

43:48.670 --> 43:50.130
Stirring performance, boys.

43:50.297 --> 43:52.216
I was really moved.

43:53.383 --> 43:55.761
"Jeepers, mister"?

43:55.928 --> 43:59.056
I was going for innocence.

43:59.223 --> 44:03.143
And, hey, two thumbs way,
way up for our leading lady.

44:03.310 --> 44:05.354
What a dish.
What a doll.

44:05.521 --> 44:07.814
Get outta there, ya big lug,
while ya still can.

44:08.524 --> 44:10.609
Phil, I-I did great.

44:10.776 --> 44:12.611
They even applauded. Sort of.

44:14.196 --> 44:16.490
Huh! I hate
to burst your bubble, kid...

44:16.657 --> 44:18.534
but that ain't applause.

44:25.290 --> 44:28.794
Ph-Ph-Ph-Phil?
What do you call that thing?

44:28.961 --> 44:31.421
Two words:

44:31.588 --> 44:33.131
am-scray!

44:36.176 --> 44:39.721
Let's get ready to rumble!

44:46.937 --> 44:49.147
That's it. Dance around!
Dance around!

44:49.314 --> 44:52.651
Watch the teeth! Watch the teeth!
Keep going. Come on. Come on.

44:52.818 --> 44:55.737
Lead with your left.
Lead with your left. Your other left!

45:22.264 --> 45:24.474
Whoa!

45:50.125 --> 45:53.295
All right! All right!
You're bad! Okay!

45:53.462 --> 45:57.674
See, Phil?
That... That wasn't so hard.

45:57.841 --> 46:01.053
Kid, kid, kid.
How many horns do you see?

46:01.220 --> 46:03.222
- Six?
- Eh, close enough.

46:03.388 --> 46:05.265
Let's get you cleaned up.

46:09.561 --> 46:14.316
Guys, guys, relax.
It's only halftime.

46:17.528 --> 46:19.321
That doesn't sound good.

46:27.162 --> 46:28.664
Definitely not good!

46:57.693 --> 47:00.696
Will you forget
the head-slicing thing?

47:08.370 --> 47:11.206
Phil, I don't think we covered this one
in basic training!

47:23.010 --> 47:25.888
My favourite part of the game:

47:28.724 --> 47:30.392
sudden death.

47:51.663 --> 47:55.501
Oh. There goes another one.

47:55.667 --> 47:57.836
Just like Achilles.

48:00.005 --> 48:01.840
Game...

48:02.007 --> 48:05.636
set, match.

48:08.680 --> 48:10.766
Hmm?

48:28.784 --> 48:31.620
Phil, you gotta admit.

48:31.787 --> 48:34.039
That was pretty heroic.

48:34.206 --> 48:38.502
Ya did it, kid! Ya did it!
Ya won by a landslide!

48:41.755 --> 48:43.632
Hades mad.

48:46.218 --> 48:48.637
Well, what do you know?

48:53.308 --> 48:56.812
From that day forward,
our boy Hercules could do no wrong.

48:56.979 --> 49:00.524
He was so hot,
steam looked cool.

49:00.691 --> 49:03.861
Oh, yeah

49:04.027 --> 49:06.572
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

49:06.738 --> 49:09.616
Person of the week
in every Greek opinion poll

49:09.783 --> 49:12.452
- What a pro
- Herc could stop a show

49:12.619 --> 49:15.455
Point him at a monster
and you're talkin 'SRO

49:15.622 --> 49:18.292
- He was a no one
- A zero, zero

49:18.458 --> 49:21.378
- Now he's a honcho
- He's a hero

49:21.545 --> 49:24.214
Here was a kid
with his act down pat

49:24.339 --> 49:27.134
Zero to hero in no time flat

49:27.301 --> 49:29.970
- Zero to hero
-Just like that

49:30.095 --> 49:32.931
When he smiled
the girls went wild

49:33.098 --> 49:35.559
With oohs and aahs

49:35.726 --> 49:38.520
And they slapped his face
on every vase

49:38.687 --> 49:41.481
On every "vahse"

49:41.648 --> 49:44.193
From appearance fees
and royalties

49:44.359 --> 49:46.904
Our Herc had cash to burn

49:47.070 --> 49:49.781
Now nouveau riche and famous

49:49.948 --> 49:53.410
He could tell you
what's a Grecian urn

49:53.577 --> 49:56.288
Say amen
There he goes again

49:56.455 --> 49:59.124
- Sweet and undefeated
- And an awesome ten for ten

49:59.249 --> 50:01.710
Folks lined up
just to watch him flex

50:01.877 --> 50:05.088
And this perfect package
packed a pair of pretty pecs

50:05.255 --> 50:08.008
Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers

50:08.175 --> 50:10.928
Honey, the crowds
were goin 'bonkers

50:11.094 --> 50:13.514
- He showed the moxie brains and spunk
- Yeah

50:13.680 --> 50:16.725
- From zero to hero
- A major hunk

50:16.892 --> 50:19.269
- Zero to hero
- And who'd have thunk

50:23.023 --> 50:24.900
Who put the glad in gladiator

50:25.067 --> 50:26.652
Hercules

50:26.818 --> 50:29.196
Whose darin 'deeds
are great theatre

50:29.363 --> 50:30.822
Hercules

50:30.989 --> 50:32.824
- Isn't he bold
- No one braver

50:32.991 --> 50:35.035
- Is he sweet
- Our favourite flavour

50:35.202 --> 50:37.037
- Hercules
- My man.

50:37.204 --> 50:38.997
- Hercules
- Hercules

50:39.164 --> 50:41.083
- Hercules
- Ooh

50:41.250 --> 50:43.669
- Hercules
- Look at my Hercules

50:43.836 --> 50:46.964
- Hercules, Hercules
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

50:47.130 --> 50:49.341
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll

50:49.508 --> 50:51.969
- Undefeated
- Riding high

50:52.135 --> 50:55.138
- And the nicest guy.
- Not conceited

50:55.305 --> 50:57.266
- He was a nothing
- A zero, zero

50:57.432 --> 50:59.226
- Now he's a honcho
- He's our hero

50:59.393 --> 51:02.354
He hit the heights
at breakneck speed

51:02.521 --> 51:04.731
From zero to hero

51:04.898 --> 51:06.733
Herc is a hero

51:06.900 --> 51:11.989
Now he's a hero

51:12.155 --> 51:14.157
Yes, indeed

51:17.202 --> 51:19.162
Pull!

51:22.416 --> 51:24.251
Nice shootin', Rex.

51:24.418 --> 51:27.462
I can't believe this guy.
I throw everything I've got at him...

51:27.629 --> 51:30.048
and it doesn't even...

51:30.215 --> 51:33.927
What are those?

51:34.094 --> 51:37.931
Um, I don't know.
I-I thought they looked kinda dashing.

51:38.098 --> 51:41.768
I've got 24 hours
to get rid of this bozo...

51:41.935 --> 51:47.316
or the entire scheme I've been setting
up for 18 years goes up in smoke...

51:47.482 --> 51:52.654
and you are wearing
his merchandise?

52:00.412 --> 52:02.748
Thirsty?

52:12.633 --> 52:16.720
Looks like your game's over. Wonderboy
is hitting every curve you throw at him.

52:17.930 --> 52:19.765
Oh, yeah.

52:21.308 --> 52:24.269
I wonder if maybe
I haven't been throwing...

52:24.436 --> 52:29.816
the right curves at him,
Meg, my sweet.

52:29.983 --> 52:31.818
Don't even go there.

52:31.985 --> 52:34.112
See, he's gotta have
a weakness...

52:34.279 --> 52:36.406
because everybody's
got a weakness.

52:36.573 --> 52:38.909
I mean, for what?
Pandora, it was the box thing.

52:39.076 --> 52:41.745
For the Trojans, hey.
They bet on the wrong horse, okay?

52:41.870 --> 52:44.540
We simply need
to find out Wonderboy's.

52:44.706 --> 52:46.875
I've done my part.
Get your little imps...

52:47.042 --> 52:48.836
They couldn't handle him
as a baby.

52:49.002 --> 52:51.672
I need somebody
who can handle him as a man.

52:51.797 --> 52:53.507
Hey, I've sworn off manhandling.

52:53.674 --> 52:55.843
Well, you know, that's good
because that's what got you...

52:56.009 --> 52:57.845
into this jam in the first place,
isn't it?

52:58.011 --> 53:01.348
You sold your soul to me
to save your boyfriend's life.

53:01.515 --> 53:03.976
And how does this creep thank you?

53:04.142 --> 53:07.229
By running off
with some babe.

53:07.396 --> 53:09.231
He hurt you real bad,
didn't he, Meg? Huh?

53:09.398 --> 53:11.441
Look, I learned my lesson, okay?

53:11.608 --> 53:13.902
Which is exactly why
I got a feelin'...

53:14.069 --> 53:15.988
you're gonna leap
at my new offer.

53:16.154 --> 53:19.116
You give me the key
to bringing down Wonder Breath...

53:19.283 --> 53:22.828
and I give you the thing
that you crave most...

53:22.995 --> 53:25.789
in the entire cosmos:

53:25.956 --> 53:28.959
your freedom.

53:31.837 --> 53:33.630
You should
have been there, Father.

53:33.797 --> 53:35.757
I mangled the Minotaur...

53:35.924 --> 53:38.594
grappled with the Gorgon.

53:38.719 --> 53:41.180
Just like Phil told me.
I analysed the situation...

53:41.346 --> 53:43.724
controlled my strength
and kicked.

53:46.185 --> 53:48.020
The crowds went wild!

53:50.439 --> 53:53.317
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Hah!

53:53.483 --> 53:57.404
You're doing great, son.
You're doing your old man proud.

53:57.571 --> 53:59.573
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Father.

53:59.740 --> 54:01.992
I've been waiting
for this day a long time.

54:02.159 --> 54:04.745
Hmm. What day is that, son?

54:04.912 --> 54:07.956
The day I rejoin the gods.

54:08.123 --> 54:11.543
You've done wonderfully.
You really have, my boy.

54:11.710 --> 54:13.545
You're just not there yet.

54:13.712 --> 54:17.466
You haven't proven yourself
a true hero.

54:17.633 --> 54:20.928
But, Father, I've beaten every
single monster I've come up against.

54:21.094 --> 54:24.306
I-I'm-I'm the most famous person
in all of Greece.

54:24.473 --> 54:28.268
I'm-I-I'm an action figure!

54:28.435 --> 54:31.104
I'm afraid being famous
isn't the same...

54:31.230 --> 54:34.566
as being a true hero.

54:34.733 --> 54:36.109
What more can I do?

54:36.276 --> 54:39.446
It's something you have
to discover for yourself.

54:39.613 --> 54:43.867
- But how can I...
- Look inside your heart.

54:45.452 --> 54:47.329
Father, wait!

55:03.345 --> 55:05.305
On your left
is Hercules' villa.

55:05.472 --> 55:07.724
Our next stop
is the Pecs and Flex Gift Shop...

55:07.891 --> 55:10.978
where you can pick up the great hero's
30-minute workout scroll...

55:11.144 --> 55:13.021
"Buns of Bronze".

55:13.188 --> 55:15.357
At 1:00, you got a meeting
with King Augeas.

55:15.524 --> 55:17.150
He's got a problem
with his stables.

55:17.317 --> 55:18.944
I'd advise you
not to wear your new sandals.

55:19.111 --> 55:21.405
- Phil.
- I told you, don't move!

55:21.572 --> 55:23.574
DGR, the Daughters
of the Greek Revolution.

55:23.740 --> 55:26.285
- At 3:00, you gotta get a girdle
from some Amazons.
- Phil.

55:26.451 --> 55:29.413
Phil, what's the point?

55:31.498 --> 55:32.833
That's it!

55:33.000 --> 55:34.877
Keep your toga on, pal.

55:37.171 --> 55:40.424
Yuck! What do you mean,
"What's the point?"

55:40.591 --> 55:42.050
You wanna go to Olympus,
don't ya?

55:42.217 --> 55:46.305
Yeah, but this stuff doesn't seem
to be getting me anywhere.

55:46.471 --> 55:49.141
You can't give up now.
I'm countin' on ya.

55:49.308 --> 55:51.226
I gave this everything I had.

55:53.770 --> 55:56.607
Listen to me, kid.
I seen 'em all.

55:56.773 --> 56:00.819
And I am tellin' you...
and this is the honest-to-Zeus truth...

56:00.986 --> 56:02.946
you got somethin'
I never seen before.

56:03.113 --> 56:04.948
- Really?
- I can feel it...

56:05.115 --> 56:07.618
right down in these stubby
bowlegs of mine.

56:07.784 --> 56:10.746
There is nothin'
you can't do, kid.

56:12.539 --> 56:14.541
- It's him!
- Hey, watch it!

56:14.708 --> 56:16.001
- Watch it! Watch...
- I touched his elbow!

56:16.168 --> 56:19.046
- Hey, girls!
- I got his sweatband!

56:19.213 --> 56:21.423
Phil, help!

56:21.590 --> 56:24.968
- Okay. Escape plan: beta.
- Gotcha.

56:25.135 --> 56:28.889
- Hey! Where is he?
- There he goes! On the veranda!

56:29.056 --> 56:30.933
Whoa!

56:45.697 --> 56:49.034
Let's see. What could be behind
curtain number one?

56:49.201 --> 56:50.786
Meg!

56:50.953 --> 56:53.622
It's all right.
The sea of raging hormones has ebbed.

56:53.747 --> 56:56.333
Gee, i-i-it's
great to see you.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.418
I-I-I missed you.

56:58.585 --> 57:01.004
So this is what heroes do
on their days off.

57:01.171 --> 57:03.257
Nah. I'm no hero.

57:03.423 --> 57:05.634
Sure ya are.
everybody in Greece...

57:05.801 --> 57:09.221
thinks you're the greatest thing
since they put the pocket in pita.

57:09.388 --> 57:12.599
I know, it's... it's crazy. You know, I
can't go anywhere without being mobbed.

57:12.766 --> 57:15.227
- I mean...
- You sound like you could use a break.

57:15.394 --> 57:20.190
Think your nanny goat would go berserk
if you played hookey this afternoon?

57:20.357 --> 57:23.569
Oh, gee, I-I don't know. Uh, Phil's got
the rest of the day pretty much booked.

57:23.735 --> 57:25.612
Ah, Phil, schmill.

57:25.779 --> 57:28.323
Just follow me out the window,
round the dumbbells.

57:28.490 --> 57:31.159
You lift up the back wall
and we're gone.

57:36.582 --> 57:38.667
Wow. What a day.

57:38.834 --> 57:40.752
First that restaurant by the bay.

57:40.919 --> 57:44.298
And then that, that play,
that, that, that Oedipus thing.

57:44.464 --> 57:46.884
Man! I thought I had problems.

57:49.428 --> 57:54.433
- Psst! Stop foolin' around.
- Yeah. Get the goods, sister.

57:54.600 --> 57:58.020
I didn't know that playing hookey
could be so much fun.

57:58.187 --> 58:00.772
Yeah, neither did I.

58:00.939 --> 58:04.193
- Thanks, Meg.
- Oh.

58:04.359 --> 58:06.445
Don't thank me just yet.

58:06.612 --> 58:09.031
- Oh!
- Oop. Careful.

58:09.198 --> 58:11.116
sorry. Weak ankles.

58:11.283 --> 58:15.454
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you better
sit down for a while.

58:15.621 --> 58:19.625
So, uh, do you
have any problems...

58:19.791 --> 58:21.752
with things like this?

58:21.919 --> 58:24.838
- Uh...
- Weak ankles, I mean.

58:25.005 --> 58:27.799
Oh, uh, no, not really.

58:27.966 --> 58:31.762
No weaknesses whatsoever?

58:31.929 --> 58:34.681
- No trick knee?
- Uh...

58:34.848 --> 58:37.351
Ruptured disks?

58:39.561 --> 58:44.483
No. I'm, I'm, I'm afraid
I'm, uh, fit as a fiddle.

58:44.650 --> 58:48.695
- Wonderboy, you are perfect.
- Thanks.

58:50.155 --> 58:52.533
Whoops!

58:53.992 --> 58:56.036
It looks better that way.

58:56.203 --> 58:58.580
No, it really does.

59:05.337 --> 59:07.422
You know, when, when I was a kid...

59:07.589 --> 59:11.844
I, I would have given anything to be
exactly like everybody else.

59:12.010 --> 59:14.513
You wanted to be
petty and dishonest?

59:14.680 --> 59:18.392
- everybody's not like that.
- Yes, they are.

59:18.559 --> 59:21.812
- You're not like that.
- How do you know what I'm like?

59:21.979 --> 59:23.814
All I know is...

59:23.981 --> 59:29.027
you're the most amazing person with
weak ankles I've ever met.

59:32.614 --> 59:34.283
Oh!

59:34.449 --> 59:36.869
Meg, when I'm with you...

59:37.035 --> 59:41.373
I-I don't feel so alone.

59:41.540 --> 59:43.959
Sometimes it's better
to be alone.

59:44.126 --> 59:47.504
- What do you mean?
- Nobody can hurt you.

59:51.300 --> 59:56.346
Meg? I would never ever hurt you.

59:56.513 --> 59:59.099
And I don't wanna
hurt you, so...

59:59.266 --> 01:00:01.727
let's both do
ourselves a favour and...

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:06.690
stop this before we...

01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:10.694
All right! Break it up!
Break it up! Party's over!

01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:13.572
- I've been lookin' all over this town!
- Calm down, mutton man.

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:16.200
- It was all my fault.
- You're already on my list, sister!

01:00:16.366 --> 01:00:18.493
So don't make it worse!

01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:23.582
And as for you, ya bum,
you're gonna go to the stadium...

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:25.918
and you're gonna be put through
the workout of your life!

01:00:26.084 --> 01:00:30.297
- Now get on the horse.
- Okay, okay.

01:00:30.464 --> 01:00:33.133
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, he'll get over it.

01:00:38.847 --> 01:00:41.767
Move! Move, move,
move, move, move! Move!

01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:50.025
Hey, watch it. Watch it.
Watch it.

01:00:50.192 --> 01:00:52.402
Keep your goo-goo eyes on the...

01:00:54.613 --> 01:00:58.867
That's it. Next time, I drive.

01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:09.002
Oh, what's the matter with me?

01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:12.798
You'd think a girl would learn.

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:17.261
If there's a prize
for rotten judgment

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:21.306
I guess I've already won that

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:25.936
No man is worth the aggravation

01:01:26.103 --> 01:01:29.606
That's ancient history
Been there, done that

01:01:29.773 --> 01:01:33.527
Who do ya think you're kidding
He's the earth and heaven toya

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:37.030
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya

01:01:37.197 --> 01:01:39.324
- Oh, no
- Girl, you can't conceal it

01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:44.288
We know how you feel
and who you're thinkin' of

01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:49.960
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

01:01:50.127 --> 01:01:53.672
You swoon, you sigh
Why deny it, uh-oh

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:57.843
It's too cliche
I won't say I'm in love

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:01.555
Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
Oo-oo-oo

01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:05.142
I thought my heart
had learned its lesson

01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:08.812
It feels so good
when you start out

01:02:08.979 --> 01:02:13.400
- Ah
- My head is screaming, get a grip, girl

01:02:13.567 --> 01:02:17.362
Unless you're dyin'
to cry your heart out, oh

01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:21.074
You keep on denyin ' who you are
and how you're feelin'

01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:25.245
Baby, we're not buyin'
Hon, we saw you hit the ceilin'

01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:28.874
Face it like a grown up
When you gonna own up that you

01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:31.919
- Got
- Got
- Got it bad

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:37.424
Oh, no chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:41.386
- Give up, but give in
- Check the grin, you're in love

01:02:41.553 --> 01:02:45.182
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love

01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:49.102
You're doin 'flips, read our lips
You're in love

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:51.104
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo
- You're way off base

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.065
- I won't say it
- She won't say love

01:02:53.232 --> 01:02:57.069
Get off my case
I won't say it

01:02:57.236 --> 01:03:02.574
Girl, don't be proud
It's okay, you're in love

01:03:02.699 --> 01:03:05.369
Oh

01:03:05.536 --> 01:03:08.664
At least out loud

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:12.459
I won't say I'm in

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:15.420
- Love
- Shoo-doo, shoo-doo, shoo-doo

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:18.757
Shoo-doo
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

01:03:18.924 --> 01:03:21.093
Ha

01:03:31.436 --> 01:03:33.605
Hey, what's the buzz, huh, Meg?

01:03:33.772 --> 01:03:37.109
What is the weak link
in Wonderboy's chain?

01:03:37.276 --> 01:03:41.154
-Get yourself another girl. I'm through.
-I'm sorry. You mind runnin'
that by me again?

01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:43.991
I must have had a chunk of brimstone
wedged in my ear or something.

01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:48.328
Then read my lips! Forget it.

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:52.958
Meg, Meg, Meg,
my sweet deluded little minion.

01:03:53.125 --> 01:03:57.754
Aren't we forgetting one teensy-weensy,
but ever so crucial little, tiny detail?

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.756
I own you!

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:04.636
- Oh, oh, I got another horn here.
- You work for me.

01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:07.181
That kid's gonna be
doin' laps for a month.

01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:10.350
If I say, "Sing",
you say, "Hey, name that tune".

01:04:10.517 --> 01:04:14.980
If I say, "l want Wonderboy's head
on a platter", you say...

01:04:15.147 --> 01:04:16.982
Medium or well done?

01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:21.612
Oh! I knew that dame was trouble.
This is gonna break the kid's heart.

01:04:21.778 --> 01:04:24.907
- I'll work on that.
- I'm sorry. You hear that sound?

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:29.661
That's the sound of your freedom
fluttering out the window forever.

01:04:29.828 --> 01:04:33.665
I don't care.
I'm not gonna help you hurt him.

01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:37.836
I can't believe you're getting
so worked up about some guy.

01:04:38.003 --> 01:04:40.339
This one is different.
He's honest and, and he's sweet.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:42.341
- Please!
- He would never do anything to hurt me.

01:04:42.508 --> 01:04:47.262
- He's a guy.
- Besides, O Oneness, you can't beat him.

01:04:47.429 --> 01:04:51.808
He has no weaknesses.
He's gonna...

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:55.479
I think he does, Meg.

01:04:55.646 --> 01:04:59.358
I truly think he does.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.468
- Hey, Phil, what happened to you?
- Kid, we gotta talk.

01:05:26.635 --> 01:05:29.555
Oh, Phil, I just had
the greatest day of my life.

01:05:29.721 --> 01:05:32.975
I, I, I can't stop thinkin'
about Meg.

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:35.936
- She's somethin' else.
- Kid! I'm tryin' to talk to you!

01:05:36.103 --> 01:05:37.938
Will you come down here
and listen?

01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:42.734
Aw, how can I come down there
when I'm feelin' so up?

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.261
Gotcha!

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:11.930
Ah, very nice.
What I'm tryin' to say is...

01:06:12.097 --> 01:06:14.600
That if it wasn't foryou,
I never would have met her.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:17.019
Oh, I owe you big time,
little guy. I do.

01:06:17.186 --> 01:06:18.437
Will you just knock it off
for a couple of seconds?

01:06:18.604 --> 01:06:21.106
Rule number 38. Come on, Phil.
Keep them up there, huh?

01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:24.193
- Phil, I got two words for ya: duck!
- Listen to me. She's...

01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:25.903
- My dream come true?
- Not exactly.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.946
- More beautiful than Aphrodite?
- Aside from that!

01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:32.159
- The most wonderful...
- She's a... She's a fraud!

01:06:32.326 --> 01:06:34.786
She's been playin' ya for a sap!

01:06:34.953 --> 01:06:37.831
- Aw, come on. Stop kiddin' around.
- I'm not kiddin' around.

01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:39.833
- She...
- I know you're upset about today,
but that's no reason to...

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.294
- Kid, you're missin' the point.
- The point is, I love her.

01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:44.087
- She don't love you.
- You're crazy.

01:06:44.254 --> 01:06:46.131
- She nothin' but a two-timin'...
- Stop it!

01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:48.592
- No-good, lyin', schemin'...
- Shut up!

01:06:52.971 --> 01:06:56.517
Phil. I... Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.

01:06:56.683 --> 01:07:00.437
Okay, okay, that's it.
You won't face the truth? Fine.

01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:03.023
Phil, wait. Where ya goin'?

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:07.361
I'm hoppin' the first barge outta here.
I'm goin' home.

01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:09.655
Fine! G...

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:12.783
Go! I don't... I don't need you.

01:07:15.077 --> 01:07:18.330
I thought you were gonna be
the all-time champ...

01:07:18.497 --> 01:07:21.792
not the all-time chump.

01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:26.505
Jeez Louise,
what got his goat, huh?

01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:31.385
Baboom. Name is Hades,
lord of the dead.

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:33.512
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Uh, not now, okay?

01:07:33.679 --> 01:07:36.348
Hey, hey. I only need a few seconds,
and I'm a fast talker, all right?

01:07:36.515 --> 01:07:39.184
See, I've got
this major deal in the works.
A real estate venture, if you will.

01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:41.353
And, Herc, you little devil you.
May I call you Herc?

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.856
You seem to be constantly
getting in the way of it, huh?

01:07:44.022 --> 01:07:46.525
- You've got the wrong guy.
- Hear me out, ya little...

01:07:46.692 --> 01:07:48.652
Just hear me out, okay?

01:07:48.819 --> 01:07:51.530
So I would be eternally grateful
if you would just...

01:07:51.697 --> 01:07:54.032
take a day off from
this hero business of yours.

01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:56.118
Jeez, I mean, monsters,
natural disasters.

01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:58.036
- You wait a day, huh?
- You're out of your mind.

01:07:58.203 --> 01:08:02.791
Not so fast, because, ya see,
I do have a little leverage
you might wanna know about.

01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:08.046
- Meg!
- Don't listen, Herc...

01:08:08.213 --> 01:08:10.299
- Let her go!
- Here's the trade-off.

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:13.260
You give up your strength
for about 24 hours, okay?

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:15.554
Say, the next 24 hours.

01:08:15.721 --> 01:08:17.598
And Meg here is free as a bird
and safe from harm.

01:08:17.764 --> 01:08:19.892
We dance, we kiss, we schmooze,
we carry on, we go home happy.

01:08:20.058 --> 01:08:22.519
What do ya say? Come on.

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:24.520
People are... are gonna
get hurt, aren't they?

01:08:24.688 --> 01:08:26.648
Nah! I mean, it's, you know,
it's a possibility.

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:28.649
It happens 'cause, you know, it's war,
but what can I tell ya?

01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:30.694
Anyway, what do you
owe these people, huh?

01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:33.697
Isn't Meg...
you little smoochy face you...
Isn't she more important than they are?

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:35.782
- Stop it!
- Isn't she?

01:08:35.948 --> 01:08:38.618
You've gotta swear
she'll be safe from any harm.

01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:40.662
Fine, okay.
I'll give you that one.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:42.915
Meg is safe, otherwise
you get your strength right back.

01:08:43.081 --> 01:08:45.125
Yadda, yadda. Fine print. Boilerplate.
Baboom. Okay? We're done.

01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:47.127
What do you say we shake on it?

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:49.337
Hey, I really don't have,
like, time to bat this around.

01:08:49.505 --> 01:08:51.381
I'm kind of on a schedule here.
I got plans for August. Okay?

01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:54.468
I need an answer, like, now.
Going once, going twice...

01:08:54.635 --> 01:08:58.388
- All right!
- Yes! We're there! Bam!

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:08.607
You may feel just a little queasy.
It's kind of natural.

01:09:08.774 --> 01:09:10.817
Maybe you should sit down!

01:09:13.111 --> 01:09:16.823
Now you know how it feels to be
just like everybody else.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.410
Isn't it just peachy?

01:09:20.577 --> 01:09:22.828
Oh! You'll love this.
One more thing.

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:25.666
Meg, babe, a deal's a deal.

01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:28.961
You're off the hook.
And by the way, Herc,

01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:31.212
is she not, like,
a fabulous little actress?

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.798
- Stop it.
- What do you mean?

01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:37.094
I mean your little chickie-poo here
was working for me all the time.

01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:40.973
- Duh.
- You're... You're lying!

01:09:41.139 --> 01:09:45.978
- Help!
- Jeepers, mister, you're really strong.

01:09:46.144 --> 01:09:50.107
- Couldn't have done it without you,
sugar, sweetheart, babe.
- No! It's... It's not like that.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:55.153
I didn't mean to...
I-I couldn't... I... I'm so sorry.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.241
Our hero's a zero!
Our hero's a zero!

01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:05.205
Well, gotta blaze. There's a whole
cosmos up there waiting for me...

01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:07.291
with, hey, my name on it.

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:13.505
So much for the preliminaries,
and now on to the main event!

01:10:26.518 --> 01:10:29.897
Brothers! Titans!

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:33.525
Look at you in your squalid prison!

01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:38.655
- Who put you down there?
- Zeus!

01:10:38.822 --> 01:10:41.241
And now that I set you free...

01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:44.870
what is the first thing
you are going to do?

01:10:45.037 --> 01:10:48.749
- Destroy him!
- Good answer.

01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:55.464
Crush Zeus!

01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:01.303
Freeze him!

01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:09.019
Melt Zeus!

01:11:09.186 --> 01:11:13.607
Blow him away!

01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:20.864
Zeus!

01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:22.699
- Uh, guys?
- Huh?

01:11:22.866 --> 01:11:25.619
Olympus would be that way.

01:11:25.786 --> 01:11:29.873
- Zeus!
- Freeze him!

01:11:29.998 --> 01:11:31.875
- Hold it, bright eye.
- Huh?

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:35.128
I have a special job for you,
my optic friend.

01:11:42.594 --> 01:11:46.223
- Huh? Huh?
- Destroy Zeus!

01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:50.143
Oh, we're in trouble!
Oh, big trouble! I gotta...

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.604
My lord and lady,
the Titans have escaped.

01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:54.648
And they're practically
at our gates!

01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:58.861
Sound the alarm!
Launch an immediate counterattack!

01:11:59.027 --> 01:12:01.613
- Go! Go!
- Gone, babe.

01:12:04.157 --> 01:12:06.326
Huh?

01:12:11.123 --> 01:12:16.253
- Charge!
- On to battle!

01:12:26.847 --> 01:12:29.224
Ya windbag!

01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:33.145
Boom, badda-boom!
Boom, boom!

01:12:36.732 --> 01:12:40.611
Hercules!

01:12:40.777 --> 01:12:44.031
Where are you?

01:12:45.741 --> 01:12:48.660
- What can we do?
- Where is Hercules?

01:12:48.827 --> 01:12:51.663
Yeah, Hercules will save us.

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:55.167
Hercules!

01:12:55.334 --> 01:13:00.964
Come out! Face me!

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:04.468
Oh, what are you doing?
Without your strength, you'll be killed.

01:13:04.635 --> 01:13:07.429
- Hercules!
- There are worse things.

01:13:07.596 --> 01:13:11.391
- Run!
- Wait! Stop!

01:13:11.558 --> 01:13:16.647
- Hey, look! It's Hercules.
- Thank the gods! We're saved!

01:13:16.813 --> 01:13:20.859
So, you mighty Hercules.

01:13:27.741 --> 01:13:29.952
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:13:34.623 --> 01:13:38.377
Easy, horsefeathers.
Whoa! Stop twitching!

01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:42.631
Listen.
Hercules is in trouble.

01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:45.717
We've gotta find Phil. He's the only one
who can talk some sense into him.

01:13:51.056 --> 01:13:53.267
Get back! Blast you!

01:13:57.354 --> 01:14:01.608
- Ooh! Chihuahua!
- Zeus!

01:14:02.901 --> 01:14:05.946
Come on! Hury up!
We're shovin' off here!

01:14:06.071 --> 01:14:09.908
Phil! Phil,
Hercules needs your help.

01:14:10.075 --> 01:14:12.411
What does he need me for
when he's got friends like you?

01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:17.291
- He won't listen to me.
- Good! He's finally learned somethin'.

01:14:17.457 --> 01:14:21.587
Look, I know what I did was wrong,
but this isn't about me. It's about him.

01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:25.090
If you don't help him now,
Phil, he'll die.

01:14:25.257 --> 01:14:27.384
I need more thunderbolts!

01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:31.930
Uh, Hephaestus has been captured,
my lord. everyone's been captured.

01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:35.726
I've been captured.
Hey, hey, watch the glasses.

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:43.650
Zeusy, I'm home!

01:14:43.817 --> 01:14:47.613
Hades! You're behind this?

01:14:47.738 --> 01:14:51.033
You're correct, sir!

01:14:53.994 --> 01:14:56.288
Flea!

01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:03.420
- Hercules!
- Phil.

01:15:03.587 --> 01:15:06.798
Come on, kid. Come on. Fight back.
Come on. You can take this bum.

01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:11.845
- This guy's a pushover. Look at him.
- You were right all along, Phil.

01:15:12.012 --> 01:15:15.390
- Dreams are for rookies.
- No, no, no, no, no, kid.

01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:19.603
Givin' up is for rookies. I came back
'cause I'm not quittin' on ya.

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:23.815
I'm willin' to go the distance.
How about you?

01:15:26.318 --> 01:15:29.238
Me bite off head!

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:36.370
Whoa, baby!

01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:51.343
Hercules! Look out!

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:54.513
Meg! No!

01:16:03.146 --> 01:16:05.816
What's happening?

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.570
H-Hades' deal is broken.

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:13.574
He promised I wouldn't get hurt.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:18.829
Meg, why... why... why did ya...
You didn't have to...

01:16:18.996 --> 01:16:23.208
Oh, people always
do crazy things...

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:25.878
when they're in love.

01:16:26.044 --> 01:16:29.923
Oh, Meg. Meg, I... I...

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:34.887
Are you always this articulate?

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:42.394
You... You haven't got much time.
You can still stop Hades.

01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:45.689
I'll watch over her, kid.

01:16:45.856 --> 01:16:49.985
You're gonna be all right.
I promise.

01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:55.324
Let's go, Pegasus!

01:16:57.201 --> 01:16:59.536
Hup, two, three, four!
Come on, everybody!

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:02.372
- I can't hear you!
- Oh, oh, that.

01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:06.710
I swear to you, Hades,
when I get out of th...

01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:09.421
I'm the one giving orders now,
bolt boy.

01:17:09.546 --> 01:17:12.299
And I think
I'm gonna like it here.

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:16.553
Don't get too
comfortable, Hades!

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.098
- Hercules!
- This ought to even the odds!

01:17:23.101 --> 01:17:26.897
- Yeah, Hercules! Thank you, man.
- Get them!

01:17:30.067 --> 01:17:32.152
Whoa! Hey!

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:35.697
No! Get him! Not me! Him!

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:42.704
Follow the fingers! Him!
The yutz with the horse!

01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:52.381
- Thank you, my boy.
- Nice horsey!

01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:57.344
My intentions were pure.
I really was attracted to you.

01:17:59.263 --> 01:18:04.518
- Throw!
- Ah! Now watch your old man work!

01:18:04.685 --> 01:18:06.520
Uh-oh!

01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:12.067
Guys, get your
titanic rears in gear...

01:18:12.234 --> 01:18:15.445
and kick some Olympian butt.

01:18:15.612 --> 01:18:18.365
Whoa! Is my hair out?

01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:49.021
Thanks a ton, Wonderboy. But at least
I've got one swell consolation prize...

01:18:49.188 --> 01:18:53.567
a friend of yours
who's dying to see me.

01:18:53.734 --> 01:18:54.860
Meg.

01:19:25.224 --> 01:19:26.767
Meg.

01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:35.651
Meg, no.

01:19:55.337 --> 01:19:57.381
Oh, I'm sorry, kid.

01:20:00.092 --> 01:20:02.427
There's some things
you just can't change.

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:07.641
Yes, I can.

01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:14.106
We were so close!

01:20:14.273 --> 01:20:17.109
So close. We tripped
at the finish line. Why?

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:21.613
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.995
- Where's Meg?
- Oh. Look who's here.

01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:32.666
- Wonderboy, you are too much.
- Let her go.

01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:36.628
Get a grip. Come here. Come here.
Let me show you around.

01:20:37.421 --> 01:20:40.924
Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld, after all, huh?

01:20:42.176 --> 01:20:45.929
- Meg!
- No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:48.765
You see, Meg's running
with a new crowd these days...

01:20:48.891 --> 01:20:51.059
and not a very lively one at that.

01:20:52.519 --> 01:20:55.814
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

01:20:55.981 --> 01:21:01.320
Oh, hmph. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

01:21:01.486 --> 01:21:03.822
- Going once!
- Hmm? Is there a downside to this?

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:06.950
- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

01:21:07.117 --> 01:21:10.537
You get her out.
She goes; you stay.

01:21:13.665 --> 01:21:17.044
Oh, you know what slipped my mind?
You'll be dead before
you can get to her.

01:21:17.211 --> 01:21:20.255
That's not a problem, is it?

01:21:45.155 --> 01:21:47.324
Oh!

01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:49.660
What's the matter
with these scissors?

01:21:49.826 --> 01:21:52.287
The thread won't cut.

01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:02.548
This is...
This is impossible!

01:22:02.714 --> 01:22:05.551
You... You... You can't be alive.
You'd have to be a, a...

01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:08.387
A god?

01:22:11.807 --> 01:22:15.561
Hercules, stop!
Ya can't do this to me! Ya can't...

01:22:15.727 --> 01:22:18.897
Fine. Okay. Listen.
Okay, well, I deserved that.

01:22:19.064 --> 01:22:22.901
Herc, Herc, Herc? Can we talk?
Y-Your dad? He's a fun guy, right?

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:25.153
So maybe you could
put in a word with him...

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.406
and he'd kind of blow
this whole thing off, you know?

01:22:27.573 --> 01:22:30.659
Meg, Meg, talk to him.
You know, a little schmooze, uh...

01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:38.834
Get away from me! Don't touch me!
Get your slimy souls off me!

01:22:39.001 --> 01:22:41.378
He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

01:22:41.503 --> 01:22:44.590
- You mean, if he gets outta there.
- Taxi!

01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:46.592
- If? If is good.
- Taxi!

01:22:46.717 --> 01:22:50.387
I don't feel so good.
I-I feel a little...

01:23:13.452 --> 01:23:17.206
Wonderboy, what...
Why did you...

01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:23.670
People always do crazy things
when they're in love.

01:23:31.803 --> 01:23:34.056
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:23:45.984 --> 01:23:48.487
Three cheers
for the mighty Hercules!

01:23:48.654 --> 01:23:51.573
Oh, yeah.
Flowers for everybody! Oh!

01:24:02.793 --> 01:24:04.837
Hercules!

01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:10.259
Hercules, we're so proud of you.

01:24:10.425 --> 01:24:12.928
Mother.

01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:17.224
Fine work, my boy!
You've done it!

01:24:17.391 --> 01:24:19.685
You're a true hero.

01:24:19.852 --> 01:24:23.897
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

01:24:24.022 --> 01:24:27.818
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength...

01:24:27.985 --> 01:24:31.697
but by the strength
of his heart.

01:24:31.864 --> 01:24:36.660
Now, at last, my son...

01:24:36.827 --> 01:24:39.621
you can come home.

01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:57.264
Congratulations, Wonderboy.
You'll make one heck of a god.

01:25:05.397 --> 01:25:10.110
Father, this is the moment
I've always dreamed of...

01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:13.739
but...

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:18.744
a life without Meg,
even an immortal life...

01:25:18.911 --> 01:25:21.747
would be empty.

01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:25.959
I...

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.462
I wish to stay
on Earth with her.

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:31.298
I finally know where I belong.

01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:46.813
Hit it, ladies.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:50.609
Oh, gonna shout it
from the mountaintops

01:25:50.776 --> 01:25:52.277
A staris born

01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:54.780
It's the time
for pullin 'out the stops

01:25:54.947 --> 01:25:56.448
A star is born

01:25:56.615 --> 01:26:00.494
- Honey, hit us with a hallelu
- That kid came shinin' through

01:26:00.661 --> 01:26:02.496

01:26:12.923 --> 01:26:16.635
Come on, everybody, shout out loud
A star is born

01:26:16.802 --> 01:26:20.848

Within your heart's the power

01:26:21.014 --> 01:26:24.768
For makin 'you a hero too

01:26:24.935 --> 01:26:28.021
So don't lose hope
when you're for lorn

01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:30.524

I-I'm here with nothin'.
Anybody listenin'?

01:32:37.933 --> 01:32:40.227
It's like I'm... What am I,
an echo or something?

01:32:40.394 --> 01:32:43.480
Hello? Hello?
Am I talking to, what?

01:32:43.647 --> 01:32:47.150
Hyperspace? Hello, it's me.
Nobody listens.
