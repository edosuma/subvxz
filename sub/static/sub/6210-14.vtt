Brain freeze is something
you bring on yourself.

00:04.336 --> 00:05.470
I guess I went
a little haywire

00:05.471 --> 00:07.806
when we bet on who could drink
a Polar Freeze the fastest.

00:07.807 --> 00:08.973
( groans )

00:08.974 --> 00:10.108
Well, if it's
any consolation

00:10.109 --> 00:12.343
at this difficult time,
you lost.

00:12.344 --> 00:13.544
So according to our deal,

00:13.545 --> 00:16.814
you owe me
one giant surprise gift.

00:16.815 --> 00:18.049

00:18.050 --> 00:20.118
Kinkle, Spellman.

00:20.119 --> 00:21.653

( gasps )

00:21.654 --> 00:24.689
Is Mr. Kraft still dating
your aunt Zelda?

00:24.690 --> 00:26.991
No. See?
I'm in denial about it.

00:26.992 --> 00:27.992
You better go.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.462
Hey, kids.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.162
We were just getting ready
to watch a video.

00:32.164 --> 00:33.298
Why don't you
join us?

00:33.299 --> 00:34.666
That is, if you think
you can handle

00:34.667 --> 00:36.067
the bittersweet
anarchy

00:36.068 --> 00:38.235
of <i>Billy Jack Goes</i>

00:38.236 --> 00:39.371
Cool... Ooh!

00:39.372 --> 00:41.839
Oh, brain freeze.
I better get him home.

01:11.537 --> 01:12.770
Sorry.

01:12.771 --> 01:14.039
I just can't stop reliving

01:14.040 --> 01:15.506
the disgusting spectacle

01:15.507 --> 01:18.143
I witnessed
at that table last night.

01:18.144 --> 01:21.546
Aunt Hilda told her "I-could-
have-been-a-great-dancer" story?

01:21.547 --> 01:22.981
Worse. Right where
you're sitting,

01:22.982 --> 01:26.184
Zelda was making goo-goo
eyes with the Casanova

01:26.185 --> 01:28.386
of the hall pass,
Willard Kraft.

01:28.387 --> 01:30.254
Ugh! Gross, gross, gross,
gross, gross.

01:30.255 --> 01:32.957
Think happy thoughts,
like bunnies and flowers.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.493
I'm glad Aunt Zelda's
found a boyfriend,

01:34.494 --> 01:36.094
but couldn't it
have been a mammal?

01:36.095 --> 01:37.995
Personally,
I'm over it.

01:37.996 --> 01:41.199
Oh, sure, I had issues
with my sister dating a man

01:41.200 --> 01:43.301
who's still hopelessly
in love with me,

01:43.302 --> 01:45.069
but then I just decided
to let it go.

01:45.070 --> 01:46.704
I suggest you do the same.

01:46.705 --> 01:48.540
You're right.
It's not like he's moving in.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.108

01:50.109 --> 01:51.142

Ooh.

02:06.525 --> 02:08.860
Ooh, it looks <i>muy bueno.</i>

02:08.860 --> 02:10.895
I'll tell you
what <i>muys</i> my <i>bueno</i>

02:10.895 --> 02:13.197
is when you wear

02:19.404 --> 02:22.139
Oh, Sabrina,
I almost forgot,

02:22.140 --> 02:24.142
I can't drive you
to school this morning,

02:24.143 --> 02:28.312
but, luckily, Willard said
he'd be delighted to take you.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.582
Super.

02:33.085 --> 02:34.586
And Sabrina didn't
get brain freeze

02:34.587 --> 02:36.521
because she allows the slush
to sit in her mouth

02:36.522 --> 02:38.623
and reach body temperature
before exposing it

02:38.624 --> 02:39.758
to her soft palette.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.359
You spend entirely
too much time

02:41.360 --> 02:43.228
at frozenslushy.com.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.030
So, what surprise
are you gonna get her?

02:45.031 --> 02:47.132
I thought the biggest surprise
might be no surprise.

02:47.133 --> 02:49.500
So, what you're saying
is you need my help?

02:51.036 --> 02:53.004
( students jeering )

02:56.775 --> 02:59.077
I warned you
to roll up your windows

02:59.078 --> 03:00.145
when we hit school property.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.312
But you didn't say

03:01.313 --> 03:03.448
it was because students
pelt you with garbage.

03:03.449 --> 03:06.116
I thought
that was implied.

03:06.117 --> 03:07.485
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:07.486 --> 03:12.257
these hallways are crying out
for the iron fist of order.

with a dog?

03:31.310 --> 03:33.044
Uh, absolutely not.

03:33.045 --> 03:34.012
Hate 'em.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.146
Aha!

03:35.147 --> 03:37.782
There's a trail
of slobber on your back.

03:37.783 --> 03:39.116
It's hair product?

03:39.117 --> 03:40.718
All right.

03:40.719 --> 03:43.087
He answers to "Silky,"
his owner's a butcher,

03:43.088 --> 03:45.689

bat me around to get meat.

03:45.690 --> 03:48.459
It's time you look into a little
thing we call "dignity."

03:48.460 --> 03:50.028
And get rid
of that steak catalog.

03:50.029 --> 03:52.363
We know you don't read
the articles.

03:52.364 --> 03:53.999

Stop.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.799

03:55.800 --> 03:57.802
No. No, Willard.

03:57.803 --> 04:00.338
I'm sure Hilda
and Sabrina won't mind.

04:00.339 --> 04:03.007
Bye, monkey. Heh.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.210
Won't mind what?

04:06.211 --> 04:07.378
Willard's grandmother
is doing

04:07.379 --> 04:09.246
a massive renovation
on her house,

04:09.247 --> 04:11.249
so Willard needs a place
to stay.

04:11.250 --> 04:14.085
I told him he could use
the apartment over the garage.

04:14.086 --> 04:16.587
But we don't have an apartment
over our garage.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.990
( clunk )

04:18.991 --> 04:20.925
We do now.

04:20.926 --> 04:22.760
By the way, I mind a lot!

04:22.761 --> 04:24.862
In fact, I've never minded
anything so much in my life!

04:24.863 --> 04:26.164
Don't you mind?

04:26.165 --> 04:27.298
Nope.

04:27.299 --> 04:30.434
I center on my chi,
and I am free from care.

04:30.435 --> 04:31.702
Well, I'm not.

04:31.703 --> 04:34.405
I'll go mad, I tell you!

04:34.406 --> 04:35.639
Mad!

04:35.640 --> 04:37.275
Hey.
Hey. Any ideas?

04:37.276 --> 04:39.344
Think Sabrina would
like some car mats?

04:39.345 --> 04:40.812
That's not
the greatest gift idea

04:40.813 --> 04:41.946
when you don't have a car.

04:41.947 --> 04:43.848
You know what, it's not

How 'bout a photo portrait
of the two of you?

04:48.621 --> 04:50.721
But I already bought
the car mats.

04:50.722 --> 04:51.722
Hey, guys, what's up?

04:51.723 --> 04:53.024
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

No. He's living
over the garage,

05:15.114 --> 05:17.748
which is further from the house
than most restraining orders.

05:17.749 --> 05:19.083
I'll probably never
see him.

05:20.118 --> 05:21.986
( <i>light rock theme playing</i> )

06:01.994 --> 06:03.695
Salem, I have
a few questions

06:03.696 --> 06:05.596
about carbon monoxide,
garage apartments,

06:05.597 --> 06:07.966
and making something
look like an accident.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.667
( barks )
Beg your pardon?

06:09.668 --> 06:11.936
I said, "What a pity.
Now, roll over."

06:11.937 --> 06:13.070

06:13.071 --> 06:15.339
Berlitz's <i>How To Speak Dog?</i>

06:19.311 --> 06:21.179
( <i>man barks</i> )
Shame on you, Salem.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.546
Silky thinks he's your friend

06:22.547 --> 06:24.582
and you're just using him
for your own pleasure.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.316
I thought that was
the point of dogs.

06:26.317 --> 06:28.318
Besides,
I <i>am</i> helping him.

06:28.319 --> 06:30.922
He'll never manage his owner
until he learns how to beg.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.558
If the result is beefsteak
for the cat, so be it.

06:34.559 --> 06:37.562
Maybe you can train him to chase
Mr. Kraft from the neighborhood.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.930
( barks )

06:38.931 --> 06:40.999
Stop asking me
where the library is.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.933
I'm in crisis here.

06:44.803 --> 06:46.003
I can't take it anymore.

06:46.004 --> 06:47.504
Our house has become
the Smithsonian

06:47.505 --> 06:49.940
of his toenail clippings.

06:49.941 --> 06:51.842
Isn't he driving you crazy?

06:51.843 --> 06:53.110
I have made
a personal choice

06:53.111 --> 06:55.780
not to be affected
by Willard Kraft.

06:55.781 --> 06:57.281
He used your toothbrush.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.401
I'm gonna get my copy
of <i>Love Letters</i>

07:17.402 --> 07:19.069
and we can read them
to each other.

07:19.070 --> 07:20.505
Oh, yes.
Oh!

07:26.211 --> 07:29.380
That is one special lady.

07:29.381 --> 07:31.548
You know, you might want
to start thinking

07:31.549 --> 07:34.285
about calling me
"Uncle Willard."

07:38.390 --> 07:40.558
Well, they're always looking
for nuns, right?

07:40.559 --> 07:42.760
Just breathe
and let it go, Sabrina.

07:42.761 --> 07:45.062
Uh, you can call me
"Uncle Willard" too, Hilda.

07:48.033 --> 07:51.002
He must be destroyed!

07:51.003 --> 07:56.006
( barking )

07:56.007 --> 07:58.175
( barking )

07:58.176 --> 07:59.443
( barking )

07:59.444 --> 08:01.478
Shoot. What's the word
for "floor"?

08:01.479 --> 08:02.980
Oh, yeah. Uh...

08:02.981 --> 08:03.848
( barks )

08:05.583 --> 08:07.418
So we'd just be getting
Mr. Kraft out of here

08:07.419 --> 08:08.986
for Aunt Zelda's own good.

08:08.987 --> 08:11.623
Absolutely.
Someday she'll thank us.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.157
Should we poison him?

08:13.158 --> 08:14.892
Don't you think
that's a little harsh?

08:14.893 --> 08:16.627
Love lifts them up
where they belong?

08:16.628 --> 08:18.596
I knew he was bothering you.

08:18.597 --> 08:20.565
We've got to find
some dirt on Kraft

08:20.566 --> 08:22.499
that will make Zelda
break up with him.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.603
Oh! Perfect:

08:36.581 --> 08:38.816
<i>Elementary school</i>
<i>classmates describe him</i>

08:38.817 --> 08:42.553
<i>as "a loner," "an outsider"</i>
<i>and "doodie breath."</i>

08:42.554 --> 08:44.054
Let's fast-forward
through puberty.

08:44.054 --> 08:45.890
My hunch is it's ugly.

08:45.891 --> 08:47.558
Well, I know he had
a messy divorce.

08:47.559 --> 08:48.926
Ooh, hit "play."

08:48.927 --> 08:50.994
HOST:
<i>Her name was Lucy,</i>

08:50.995 --> 08:52.963
<i>the only woman</i>
<i>who could give Willard</i>

08:52.964 --> 08:55.098
<i>the courage to dream again.</i>

08:55.099 --> 08:58.102
<i>Love transformed</i>
<i>the normally vexatious loner</i>

08:58.103 --> 09:00.405
<i>into a frolicking free spirit.</i>

09:00.406 --> 09:02.407
<i>Whimsy was his copilot.</i>

09:02.408 --> 09:05.375
<i>Indeed, Willard Kraft was</i>
<i>in love with love.</i>

09:05.376 --> 09:07.778
<i>They were married</i>
<i>in a small, private ceremony</i>

09:07.779 --> 09:10.647
<i>presided over</i>
<i>by her massage therapist.</i>

09:12.684 --> 09:14.118
They were so in love.

09:14.119 --> 09:15.285
( sighs )

09:15.286 --> 09:17.055
I can't just sit here
and let Zelda get hurt

09:17.056 --> 09:19.590
by a man who still loves
two other women.

09:19.591 --> 09:22.126
Two? Oh. Right.

09:22.127 --> 09:23.394
We've gotta bring her back.

09:23.395 --> 09:25.396
It's gonna be so hard
on Aunt Zelda.

09:25.397 --> 09:26.964
I don't think
I can do that to her.

09:26.965 --> 09:30.300
KRAFT:
Has anyone seen
my antifungal foot ointment?

09:31.636 --> 09:32.837
<i>Mr. Kraft</i>
<i>With a past so juicy</i>

09:32.838 --> 09:34.605
<i>Return to us</i>
<i>His ex-wife Lucy</i>

09:37.009 --> 09:38.376
Ah...

09:38.377 --> 09:41.446
It's good to be back
in the mortal realm.

09:41.447 --> 09:42.780
"Mortal realm"?

09:42.781 --> 09:43.914
Wait a minute.

09:43.915 --> 09:45.182
You're a witch?!

09:50.455 --> 09:52.456
Mr. Kraft married
a witch?

09:52.457 --> 09:55.660
Well, of course,
he didn't know I was a witch.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.528
I thought it would be...

09:57.529 --> 09:59.230
less confusing that way.

10:02.033 --> 10:04.936
Oh, I have
my magic again.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.137
Oh, I adore
the mortal realm.

10:07.138 --> 10:10.207
It's such a refreshing change
from where I live:

10:10.208 --> 10:12.509
The Republic
of Infinite Horror.

10:12.510 --> 10:13.844
Sounds exotic.

10:13.845 --> 10:15.312
It's near Lake Male Superior.

10:15.313 --> 10:16.914
It's an awful part
of the Other Realm

10:16.915 --> 10:19.483
where women are forbidden
to use magic.

10:19.484 --> 10:21.252
Who came up
with that brainstorm?

10:21.253 --> 10:22.787
The men.
The men.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.655
Then why don't you just move
to the mortal realm?

10:24.656 --> 10:27.324
My republic forbids a woman
to emigrate without a husband

10:27.325 --> 10:29.193
and that's why
I married Willard.

10:29.194 --> 10:30.828
And because
you loved him.

10:31.763 --> 10:32.897
Okay.

10:32.898 --> 10:36.200
And I would do anything
to get him back.

10:36.201 --> 10:38.536
Oh, dear,
here come the waterworks.

10:39.738 --> 10:42.106
So why did
you two split up?

10:42.107 --> 10:44.842
Why does any relationship
go bad?

10:44.843 --> 10:47.712
Maybe I shouldn't have turned
him into a beast of burden,

10:47.713 --> 10:50.314
or made out
with his best friend Dexter.

10:50.315 --> 10:51.349
The bottom line is

10:51.350 --> 10:52.750
Willard divorced me,

10:52.751 --> 10:56.487
and without him,
I was deported back to the I.H.

10:56.488 --> 10:57.454
Infinite Horror.

10:57.455 --> 10:58.489
Right.

10:58.490 --> 10:59.924
Well, if it helps at all,

10:59.925 --> 11:01.625
I think
he's right downstairs.

11:01.626 --> 11:02.659
Really?

11:02.660 --> 11:05.429
I-- I haven't seen him
since the day I...

11:05.430 --> 11:09.033
left the fence unlatched
and he got out.

11:09.034 --> 11:11.235
She seems nice.

11:11.903 --> 11:13.470
( clank )

11:13.471 --> 11:14.771
Oh. Hoo-hoo.

11:14.772 --> 11:17.341
Boy, I shouldn't wait a week
to irrigate my ears.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.744
Mr. Kraft, we have
a surprise for you.

11:22.414 --> 11:23.480
Willard, darling.

11:23.481 --> 11:24.515
No. No.

11:24.516 --> 11:26.817
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.118
This is a bad dream.

11:28.119 --> 11:29.587
( screams )

11:31.089 --> 11:34.358
( door slams )
I'm so glad he's still alive.

11:35.894 --> 11:37.928
Hey, Valerie,
I made an appointment

11:37.929 --> 11:39.029
at a portrait studio

11:39.030 --> 11:40.798
and I have the perfect way
to get Sabrina there

11:40.799 --> 11:42.032
and keep it a surprise.

11:42.033 --> 11:43.567
I'll tell her
war has broken out

11:43.568 --> 11:46.403
and I have to take her
to a secret bomb shelter.

11:46.404 --> 11:48.439
Or you could
just blindfold her

11:48.440 --> 11:50.875
and tell her
it's a surprise.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.109
Okay.

11:52.110 --> 11:55.012
So much for the sound-effect
tapes I've been making.

11:55.013 --> 11:56.480
Hello.

11:56.481 --> 11:58.482
ZELDA:
Oh, there you are,
stranger.

11:58.483 --> 12:00.217
I was beginning
to worry about you.

12:00.218 --> 12:02.987
Well, actually, I just came by
to borrow some coriander.

12:02.988 --> 12:05.957
I'm making dinner for Lucy.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.959
Lucy's a nice lady.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.893
Lucy?

12:08.894 --> 12:10.694
As in your ex-wife Lucy?

12:10.695 --> 12:15.165
Yes, apparently, she left
a hole in my life, and I...

12:16.267 --> 12:18.068
You look nice, Zelda.

12:18.069 --> 12:19.403
LUCY:
Willie-poo!

12:19.404 --> 12:20.538
Coming.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.840
Say goodbye
to Uncle Willard.

12:22.841 --> 12:25.342
I go to the trouble
of brewing you a cup

12:25.343 --> 12:28.446
of my special herb tea
and you disappear.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.481
Is it just me or are men
getting less obedient

12:30.482 --> 12:32.182
than they used to be?

12:32.183 --> 12:33.284
You must be Lucy.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.651
I'm Zelda.

12:34.652 --> 12:36.454
It's so nice
to meet you.

12:36.455 --> 12:37.888
I really miss you.

12:37.889 --> 12:39.723
LUCY: Drink your tea, dear.
Oh.

12:41.794 --> 12:42.927
Oh.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.730
Lucy has pretty eyes and...

12:45.731 --> 12:48.732
thanks to her,
no more runaway mucus.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.167
No more tissues
in the sofa cushion.

12:50.168 --> 12:51.202
I can't wait.

12:51.203 --> 12:52.403
LUCY:
Well, if you'll excuse us,

12:52.404 --> 12:54.939
I think a certain Willie-poo
has a dinner to make.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.274
Right, a dinner.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.109
They seem civil...

12:59.110 --> 13:01.078
after all these years.

13:02.714 --> 13:05.383
I think I'll, uh, take
a little walk.

13:07.819 --> 13:08.852
It's working.

13:08.853 --> 13:09.921
Yay!

13:09.922 --> 13:11.756
And Aunt Zelda's okay, right?

13:11.757 --> 13:12.589
Absolutely.

13:12.590 --> 13:13.857
This breakup
was bound to happen

13:13.858 --> 13:15.492
sooner or later,
and let's face it,

13:15.493 --> 13:18.262
the sooner the breakup,
the less pain...for us.

13:19.531 --> 13:22.133
( barking )

13:22.134 --> 13:23.234
( barks )

13:23.235 --> 13:24.435
Good, boy.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.836
Yeah, baby!

13:25.837 --> 13:27.605
I can taste the fillets.

13:27.606 --> 13:30.441
I'll just pretend
his frothy spit is a garnish.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.744
( barks )

13:33.745 --> 13:34.845
( sighs )

13:34.846 --> 13:36.347
It's so nice
that...

13:36.348 --> 13:39.917
both of you could join us
for a glass of wine.

13:39.918 --> 13:41.218
Well, I knew
there was no way

13:41.219 --> 13:43.487
I'd get this one
out of the house without me,

13:43.488 --> 13:47.825
so I finally said, "Willie-poo,
enough with the foot rubs."

13:47.826 --> 13:49.660
( Zelda chuckles )

13:49.661 --> 13:51.996
You know,
he calls me "zoo-zoo."

13:51.997 --> 13:54.798
I do?
Yes, and I call you "monkey."

13:54.799 --> 13:56.900
Like some godless
hairy primate?

13:56.901 --> 14:00.904
No, like a cute little monkey
with big eyes...

14:00.905 --> 14:02.706
and, now, he answers to "poo."

14:02.707 --> 14:04.708
There's a trade up.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.310
I'll get more wine.

14:06.311 --> 14:08.178
You two seem
to be getting along well.

14:08.179 --> 14:10.114
I like Lucy.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.015
She's a nice lady.

14:12.016 --> 14:13.017
Oh, stop.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.385
I'm sorry.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.919
Was that--?
Was that bad?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.921
No, dear,
it's a figure of speech.

14:17.922 --> 14:20.491
Fig--? Y-you're not gonna
hit me, then?

14:20.492 --> 14:22.025
( chuckling )

14:22.026 --> 14:23.394
ZELDA:
Well...

14:23.395 --> 14:25.029
KRAFT:
Ooh, I like

14:25.030 --> 14:26.797
your hair up like that.

14:26.798 --> 14:27.864
LUCY:
Willard!

14:27.865 --> 14:29.333
You look dehydrated.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.570
Uh, didn't you wanna
tell Zelda something?

14:33.571 --> 14:34.671
Yes.

14:34.672 --> 14:35.672
( clears throat )

14:35.673 --> 14:38.542
Zelda, I'm moving
out of the garage.

14:38.543 --> 14:40.744
Lucy has room
for me at her place.

14:40.745 --> 14:42.512
So thanks.

14:42.513 --> 14:44.748
I see.

14:44.749 --> 14:46.750
Well, let me tell
you something.

14:46.751 --> 14:50.554
I-- I got you cable
in that garage.

14:50.555 --> 14:52.589
What am I doing?
I'm groveling.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.259
I'm debasing myself
for a man.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.894
I sound like Hilda.

14:58.396 --> 15:00.431
Well, we should go.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.033
Your best friend Dexter's
coming over, isn't he?

15:03.034 --> 15:03.967
Shall I carry you, dear?

15:03.968 --> 15:05.068
No, not this time.

15:05.069 --> 15:06.870
We'll see ourselves out.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.943
I do not debase myself
for a man.

15:12.944 --> 15:14.278
I'm worried
about Aunt Zelda.

15:14.279 --> 15:15.513
Oh, yeah, her.

15:16.147 --> 15:17.214
Boy, it's a good thing

15:17.215 --> 15:19.950
you found out
about it now, eh, Zellie?

15:19.951 --> 15:22.186
I don't blame Willard.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.321
He seems happy.
You don't mind?

15:24.322 --> 15:27.325
Oh, when you truly care
about someone, you--

15:27.326 --> 15:29.960
You want
what's best for them...

15:29.961 --> 15:31.562
but I'm gonna miss him.

15:31.563 --> 15:33.264
Told you it was
for the best.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.600
I really don't know
why I care about that man,

15:36.601 --> 15:38.936
just he makes me so happy.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.138
Aunt Zelda, you don't
know the whole story.

15:41.139 --> 15:42.573
Lucy's from
the Other Realm.

15:42.574 --> 15:43.841
I brought her back.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.242
You what?!

15:45.243 --> 15:47.611
Aunt Hilda
and I brought her back.

15:47.612 --> 15:50.414
We had to.
He did yoga in a unitard.

15:50.415 --> 15:53.049
Wait a minute.
Lucy's a witch?

15:53.050 --> 15:55.252
Yeah, and she's using magic
to get him back.

15:55.253 --> 15:57.721
He doesn't like her,
it's the tea talking.

15:57.722 --> 16:00.457
How dare you two try
to break up Willard and me.

16:00.458 --> 16:01.759
Don't dwell on the past.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.026
You can compete
with Lucy.

16:03.027 --> 16:04.628
Start brewing potions pronto.

16:05.930 --> 16:09.699
Try the All's-Fair-
in-Love-and-War spell.

16:09.700 --> 16:12.302
Quick. I think she's
ordering him an ear tag.

16:12.303 --> 16:13.637
Maybe one little potion.

16:18.376 --> 16:20.110
I've got to get
that modem fixed.

16:20.111 --> 16:21.878
Oh, look,
your hair's down again.

16:21.879 --> 16:24.848
I guess everything eventually
loses the battle with gravity.

16:24.849 --> 16:25.782
( gavel pounds )

16:25.783 --> 16:27.184
JUDGE:
Silence!

16:27.185 --> 16:29.586
Do you know why the council
pulled you in here, ladies?

16:29.587 --> 16:30.888
Because you're lonely?

16:32.523 --> 16:35.325
"Two witches battling
over a mortal..."

16:35.326 --> 16:37.461
A vice principal?

16:37.462 --> 16:40.498
He's a heartbeat away from
running the entire high school.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.732
And he loves me.

16:41.733 --> 16:43.300
Your Honor, I'm not involved
with thi--

16:43.301 --> 16:44.334
Silence!

16:45.337 --> 16:46.537
Well,
you know the law.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.139
The Witches' Council
has clearly stated

16:49.140 --> 16:50.874
that cases
such as these

16:50.875 --> 16:53.110
must be settled
in an appropriate forum,

16:53.111 --> 16:56.280
one that is fair
and full of wisdom.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.415
AUDIENCE ( chanting ):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

16:58.416 --> 17:00.517
<i>The Jerry Springer Show?</i>

17:02.020 --> 17:03.487
You know, uh, Zelda thought

17:03.488 --> 17:04.988
she had a good thing
going with Willard

17:04.989 --> 17:06.923
until his ex-wife Lucy
came to town

17:06.924 --> 17:08.525
with a simple warning:

17:08.526 --> 17:11.228
"Get your hands off my mortal."

17:11.229 --> 17:13.530
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

17:13.531 --> 17:14.998
Why are they so excited?

17:14.999 --> 17:16.166
Because he's my man.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.169
You were just keeping him warm
till I got back.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.904
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

17:20.905 --> 17:23.874
Obviously, you're very upset.
Uh, tell us how it all started.

17:23.875 --> 17:24.941
Well, you have
to understand,

17:24.942 --> 17:26.910
Mr. Kraft is not just
Zelda's boyfriend.

17:26.911 --> 17:28.712
He's also my vice principal.

17:28.713 --> 17:29.713
AUDIENCE:
Ooh!

17:29.714 --> 17:31.415
And my ex-boyfriend.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.850
AUDIENCE:
Whoo!

17:32.851 --> 17:34.218
It was really hard
living with him,

17:34.219 --> 17:36.653
so we decided
to bring back his ex-wife.

17:36.654 --> 17:38.088
( audience jeers )

17:38.089 --> 17:39.256
We didn't know
she was a witch!

17:39.257 --> 17:40.257
Oh, everyone
can just--

17:40.258 --> 17:43.527
( bleeping )

17:43.528 --> 17:44.695
( audience cheers )

17:44.696 --> 17:45.862
She's not swearing.

17:45.863 --> 17:47.631
I know, but this way,
it sounds like she did.

17:47.632 --> 17:50.267
I think it's time now that we,
uh, bring out the mortal

17:50.268 --> 17:53.236
and, uh, maybe he can decide,
uh, which witch.

17:53.237 --> 17:56.740
Please welcome Willard Kraft!

17:56.741 --> 17:59.676
( audience booing )

17:59.677 --> 18:02.011
Lucy?

18:02.012 --> 18:03.580
And Zelda?

18:04.950 --> 18:06.350
Where am I?

18:06.351 --> 18:08.285
You're with me, dear.
Come and sit down.

18:08.286 --> 18:10.221
Don't do it, Willard.
I really care about you.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.188
She's just using you.

18:12.189 --> 18:14.791
Honey, all the magic in your bag
couldn't get you a man.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.293
( audience clamoring )

18:16.294 --> 18:18.162
AUDIENCE ( chanting ):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

18:18.163 --> 18:20.130
I didn't expect the show
would take this direction,

18:20.131 --> 18:21.965
so we'll be right back.

18:21.966 --> 18:23.733
Silky, boy!

18:23.734 --> 18:26.136
Stupid dog,
he should be back by now.

18:26.137 --> 18:30.140
If he ran across a tennis ball,
I'm doomed.

18:30.141 --> 18:32.609
We are back, and, of course, now
it's time for Willard to choose.

18:32.610 --> 18:35.379
Will it be Lucy or Zelda?

18:35.380 --> 18:36.981
I'll tell you what,
before we let him choose,

18:36.982 --> 18:38.082
we do have a surprise.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.750
You see, we did
a potion check on Willard.

18:40.751 --> 18:44.087
Okay, now, this is what
a normal man looks like.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.989
As you can see,
very few potions,

18:45.990 --> 18:49.025
because we, as witches,
have to remember

18:49.026 --> 18:51.962
that we cannot use magic
irresponsibly.

18:51.963 --> 18:53.864
You know,
there are those that...

18:53.865 --> 18:55.766
I-I'm sorry,
that's my "final thought."

18:55.767 --> 18:56.833
That comes later.

18:58.369 --> 18:59.770
Let's check in now
on Willard.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.171
HILDA:
Wow.

19:01.172 --> 19:03.340
That is worse
than Elvis' autopsy.

19:03.341 --> 19:05.142
LUCY:
I-I did it
for his own good.

19:05.143 --> 19:07.644
He was weak and, if it got me
out of the Infinite Horror,

19:07.645 --> 19:10.247
well, that was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

19:10.248 --> 19:12.349
You've got to drain him, Jerry.

19:13.918 --> 19:15.686
( cheering and applause )

19:18.856 --> 19:21.825
Okay, uh, now, Willard,
you are back to normal.

19:21.826 --> 19:24.094
So are you ready to make
a decision?

19:24.095 --> 19:27.697
Jerry, uh, this woman
is still trying to kill me--

19:27.698 --> 19:29.399
( audience jeers )

19:29.400 --> 19:33.236
--and this lady laughs
at my little jokes--

19:33.237 --> 19:34.638
( laughs )

19:36.240 --> 19:38.942
--and has the sweetest smile.

19:38.943 --> 19:40.376
Oh.
So...

19:40.377 --> 19:43.413
I guess I'm what you'd have
to call a "no-brainer."

19:43.414 --> 19:44.848
It's Lucy.

19:44.849 --> 19:45.916
( audience gasps )

19:45.917 --> 19:48.385
I'm only kidding you.
It's Zelda.

19:48.386 --> 19:49.352
No!

19:50.855 --> 19:52.923
You change your mind,
you spineless slug,

19:52.924 --> 19:55.425
'cause I ain't going
back to hell-town!

19:55.426 --> 19:57.560
Oh, yes, you are.

19:57.561 --> 19:59.429
AUDIENCE ( chanting ):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

19:59.430 --> 20:02.832
( <i>rock theme playing</i> )

20:02.833 --> 20:04.401
You know, everyone laughs
at that show,

20:04.402 --> 20:06.570
but when you're on it,
something just takes over.

20:06.571 --> 20:08.471
I hope you've learned
your lesson.

20:08.472 --> 20:10.673
You claimed you and Sabrina
were helping Zelda

20:10.674 --> 20:14.711
when, in fact, you were
just helping you and Sabrina.

20:14.712 --> 20:16.146
You did the same thing
with Silky.

20:16.147 --> 20:18.015
You weren't training him
to help Silky.

20:18.016 --> 20:19.849
It was all for Salem.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.852
I guess we were both
being selfish.

20:21.853 --> 20:24.120
Of course, in my case,
it worked out.

20:24.121 --> 20:25.188
Venison?

20:25.189 --> 20:26.556
( laughing )

20:26.557 --> 20:27.991
Oh, what a day.

20:27.992 --> 20:30.127
I just saw Willard home
and gave him a potion

20:30.128 --> 20:32.395
to keep him from remembering
any of this.

20:32.396 --> 20:33.764
Not another potion.

20:33.765 --> 20:35.932
Oh, it'll flush out
with his Metamucil.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.402
As soon as the swelling
goes down in my jaw,

20:38.403 --> 20:40.871
I wanna talk
to you and Sabrina.

20:40.872 --> 20:41.838
Where is she?

20:41.839 --> 20:42.906
Valerie whisked her away.

20:42.907 --> 20:45.642
It seemed very important
and rather formal.

20:45.643 --> 20:46.877
This had better be
a good surprise.

20:46.878 --> 20:48.311
It hasn't exactly been
the best day.

20:48.312 --> 20:51.447
Relax. Just have
a seat right here.

20:51.448 --> 20:53.516
Can I take
my blindfold off now?

20:53.517 --> 20:55.318
Shh.
Something you should know--

20:55.319 --> 20:56.753
Okay, let's get
this show on the road.

20:58.122 --> 20:59.122
( camera clicks )

21:04.329 --> 21:06.763
I want you to know that just
because I'm seeing your aunt,

21:06.764 --> 21:08.732
don't expect any
special treatment around here.

21:08.733 --> 21:09.867
I don't, Mr. Kraft.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.735
Yeah, no favors,
no politics,

21:11.736 --> 21:13.269
and no calling me
"Willard."

21:13.270 --> 21:14.604
It'll be hard,
but okay.

21:14.605 --> 21:15.939
In fact, I'm gonna have
to give you

21:15.940 --> 21:17.341
detention this Friday.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.076
What? Why?

21:19.077 --> 21:20.678
'Cause your Aunt Zelda
told me you'd been

21:20.679 --> 21:22.946
watching <i>Jerry Springer</i>
instead of doing your homework

21:22.947 --> 21:25.415
and that just
ain't kosher, milady.

21:25.416 --> 21:26.350
Well, she watches too!

21:26.351 --> 21:29.152
Hey! Don't take
that tone with me.

21:29.153 --> 21:30.954
I am still vice principal

21:30.955 --> 21:32.689
of this school,
and I demand respect.

21:32.690 --> 21:36.460
