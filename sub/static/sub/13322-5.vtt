WEBVTT

00:00.322 --> 00:02.020
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.021 --> 00:04.985
But I'm not coming home. I'm
gonna live here with Cortney.

00:04.986 --> 00:08.816
I've got a kid and a husband
who's suing for full custody

00:08.817 --> 00:10.450
because I'm an unfit mother.

00:10.485 --> 00:11.519
Can I help you?

00:11.520 --> 00:12.585
Sheila.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.588
- You adopted Kyle?
- Kyle is in prison.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.657
Are you worried I still
have feelings for Gabe?

00:17.693 --> 00:18.725
Do you?

00:18.760 --> 00:21.595
God's gonna send me the boyfriend
I want when the time is right.

00:21.596 --> 00:23.563
- Why did you bring me here?
- I thought you'd like it.

00:23.598 --> 00:26.499
Really? It didn't have anything to
do with the fact that Noah's gay?

00:26.535 --> 00:27.567
I'm Aaron.

00:27.602 --> 00:29.402
Cameron.

00:29.438 --> 00:30.737
I've been interning at the
Juvenile Justice Project.

00:30.772 --> 00:32.706
They help minors who were
given unfair trials.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.542
You look really handsome.

00:38.814 --> 00:42.582
You are like a foot taller
since I last saw you.

00:42.617 --> 00:44.417
And his voice is like an octave lower.

00:44.453 --> 00:45.518
No, it isn't.

00:45.554 --> 00:46.820
Oh, Lord.

00:46.855 --> 00:48.688
Pizza's here!

00:48.724 --> 00:51.591
Hi, guys, so good to see you.
Glad you could make it!

00:51.626 --> 00:52.726
Oh, thank you.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.862
And my baby daughter's
40th birthday party!

00:55.897 --> 00:57.797
I wouldn't miss it for the world,

00:57.833 --> 01:00.433
although I suppose it
means I'm finally old.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.435
You've been old for a while, dear.

01:04.706 --> 01:06.840
Hey, sweetheart, how are you holding up?

01:06.875 --> 01:08.541
I'm fine.

01:08.577 --> 01:10.410
Your mom told us about that boy, Nick.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.578
You were very brave.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.580
I'm just glad it's over.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.682
Yeah, you know, I'm thinking that we

01:15.717 --> 01:17.784
should cancel our room at the hotel

01:17.819 --> 01:19.519
and spend the whole weekend here.

01:19.588 --> 01:20.754
Why?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.856
Well, we could spend more
time with our grandkids.

01:23.737 --> 01:24.891
Is it okay?

01:24.926 --> 01:26.793
Yeah, they could stay in Brandon's room.

01:26.828 --> 01:28.762
And where would Brandon sleep?

01:28.797 --> 01:30.530
Jesus.

01:30.565 --> 01:31.765
What? He doesn't live here anymore.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.435
I'm sorry, where does Brandon live?

01:35.470 --> 01:39.439
With his married girlfriend
and her three-year-old son.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.607
Mariana.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.778
She's...

01:44.813 --> 01:46.613
getting a divorce.

01:48.569 --> 01:52.886
Well, then, so long as
she's getting a divorce.

01:54.523 --> 01:56.823
Why on earth would you
allow Brandon to move in

01:56.858 --> 01:59.659
with an older woman and her child?

01:59.694 --> 02:01.728
She's hardly an older woman.

02:01.763 --> 02:04.664
And believe me, we're not
allowing him, he's 18.

02:04.699 --> 02:09.469
Oh, sorry. Found the... air mattress.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.438
Are we gonna meet this girlfriend

02:11.473 --> 02:12.672
at your birthday party?

02:12.707 --> 02:14.373
Actually, I'm not sure.

02:14.409 --> 02:16.409
Brandon says she doesn't
think she'd be welcome.

02:16.445 --> 02:18.411
Perceptive girl.

02:18.447 --> 02:19.712
So you don't approve?

02:19.748 --> 02:21.714
It's not that we don't approve of her.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.551
We just... don't approve
of the situation,

02:24.586 --> 02:25.685
but we don't want to push Brandon away.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.421
Well, how much further can he get?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.824
Actually, I was thinking you should

02:30.859 --> 02:32.725
invite Cort to the party, personally.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.627
Me? Why me?

02:34.663 --> 02:36.395
Because it's my 40th birthday party

02:36.431 --> 02:38.832
and I'm pretty sure I'm not
the one she's afraid of.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.435
Dana, I really don't think

02:42.471 --> 02:44.504
this is going to fit
in here comfortably.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.738
Sweetheart, just set it
up in the living room.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.640
Stewart can sleep down there.

02:47.676 --> 02:49.408
Okay.

02:53.524 --> 02:55.582
Hold on. Okay.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.653
Mom.

03:00.689 --> 03:03.422
Something going on with you and Daddy?

03:06.862 --> 03:09.462
Turns out there's a
reason that your father

03:09.498 --> 03:11.664
doesn't want to be alone
with me in a hotel room,

03:11.700 --> 03:15.368
and it has nothing to do with spending
more time with his grandchildren.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.408
He's having an affair.

03:25.252 --> 04:04.973
FROM TUSUBTITULO

04:08.790 --> 04:11.524
What, piano lessons? Really?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.560
Dang, you must be
desperate for money, huh?

04:13.595 --> 04:14.761
Yeah, kinda.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.596
Rent's coming up, and,
of course, divorce

04:17.632 --> 04:18.865
is gonna cost a ton, so...

04:18.899 --> 04:19.832
How much?

04:19.868 --> 04:21.367
5,000 bucks.

04:21.402 --> 04:22.468
Holy...

04:22.503 --> 04:23.603
Yep.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.805
Good thing that's not your problem?

04:26.172 --> 04:27.506
Yeah.

04:31.239 --> 04:32.665
PRIVATE SAT TEST
TUTOR NEEDED

04:32.666 --> 04:34.223
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IN NEED OF SAT
TEST PREP! CALL TRISTAN CHACONES

04:36.651 --> 04:39.819
Okay, so I have some good news.

04:39.854 --> 04:41.821
We got a C-STEM grant,

04:41.856 --> 04:43.623
which means we now have enough money

04:43.658 --> 04:45.725
to enter the regional
robotics competition.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.427
How does that sound?

04:48.463 --> 04:50.763
Now, we have a ton

04:50.799 --> 04:52.632
of building and programming to do,

04:52.667 --> 04:54.601
but first we have to figure out

04:54.636 --> 04:56.569
which three of you will lead us

04:56.605 --> 04:57.870
onto the field of battle,

04:57.906 --> 05:01.340
as driver, strategist, and shooter.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.809
Any takers?

05:02.844 --> 05:05.478
Is this... we want this?

05:05.513 --> 05:06.713
Yes, we want this.

05:06.748 --> 05:08.715
No girls have ever
represented Anchor Beach

05:08.750 --> 05:10.817
behind the glass. Just put your hand up.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.518
...a little friendly competition.

05:12.553 --> 05:15.387
You have 24 hours to build a robot

05:15.423 --> 05:17.824
that can pick up this block
and dump it into this basket.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.493
The club will then vote for a winner

05:20.528 --> 05:23.562
based on speed, design, and creativity.

05:23.598 --> 05:25.564
You'll be working together
in teams of three,

05:25.600 --> 05:27.700
so... choose wisely.

05:27.736 --> 05:29.869
All right, good luck.

05:37.478 --> 05:38.544
Right now.

05:39.814 --> 05:41.748
Wow, didn't see that coming.

05:41.783 --> 05:43.482
Wanna join us?

05:50.491 --> 05:53.793
So, this, boyfriend of yours...

05:53.828 --> 05:55.862
you don't talk about him very much.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.430
Yeah, I'm not really the type of girl

05:58.466 --> 06:00.733
to talk about her boyfriend a lot.

06:00.769 --> 06:03.502
I see, but... that's it?

06:03.538 --> 06:05.672
It's not because he
doesn't actually exist?

06:07.408 --> 06:08.808
No, he exists, trust me.

06:08.843 --> 06:10.476
If you say so.

06:10.511 --> 06:13.680
'Course, some people
say Big Foot exists,

06:13.715 --> 06:16.783
but I won't believe it until
I see it with my own eyes.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.619
Go ahead.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.823
Hey, Kyle.

06:23.858 --> 06:25.825
God, it's been a long time?

06:25.860 --> 06:27.526
Hey, Callie.

06:29.630 --> 06:30.797
You look good.

06:31.833 --> 06:34.400
Thanks for coming to see me.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.735
I don't get a lot of visitors,

06:35.770 --> 06:37.469
except my mom.

06:37.505 --> 06:39.839
And it's hard on her seeing me in here.

06:39.874 --> 06:41.774
Of course.

06:42.877 --> 06:44.811
I would have come sooner

06:44.846 --> 06:46.612
if I had known.

06:46.647 --> 06:48.514
Sorry, this is Aaron.

06:48.549 --> 06:50.416
He works at the Juvenile Justice Center.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.451
I'm an intern.

06:52.486 --> 06:53.753
Oh, cool...

06:53.788 --> 06:55.654
They take on cases like yours,

06:55.690 --> 06:58.424
where a minor might not
have gotten a fair trial.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.760
You... you think you can help me?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.495
Well, we got to find something

07:03.531 --> 07:05.664
to get them to open the case back up.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.466
We talked to your mom,

07:07.501 --> 07:09.635
and she said that there was a witness,

07:09.670 --> 07:13.740
an alibi witness, who your
lawyer never contacted.

07:13.775 --> 07:14.774
Yeah...

07:14.809 --> 07:16.709
Patrick Molloy.

07:16.745 --> 07:18.577
He worked at the rec center.

07:18.613 --> 07:21.513
That's where I was the afternoon
that Mrs. Johnson was killed.

07:24.853 --> 07:28.354
You know I didn't do it, right?

07:29.390 --> 07:31.724
I mean, I would never have hurt her.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.726
She was always really nice to me.

07:33.762 --> 07:35.628
I believe you.

07:41.702 --> 07:43.469
Hey, baby.

07:43.504 --> 07:46.773
Hey! Daddy, what... what
are you doing here?

07:46.808 --> 07:48.707
Well, I just needed to talk to you

07:48.743 --> 07:50.509
without your mother around.

07:50.544 --> 07:51.610
Got a minute?

07:53.714 --> 07:55.748
So, what did you get?

07:55.784 --> 07:57.716
On my SAT? 1450.

07:57.752 --> 07:59.585
Nice.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.587
So, when are you taking the test?
Because I was thinking...

08:01.622 --> 08:03.389
It's tomorrow.

08:04.492 --> 08:07.626
Isn't that a
little late for a tutor?

08:07.662 --> 08:09.762
Well, yeah, but, you know, I was

08:09.798 --> 08:12.598
kind of thinking that you
could take it for me.

08:14.502 --> 08:16.635
I... I'm sorry. I can't do that.

08:16.671 --> 08:17.670
Look, I'll pay you.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.738
A thousand bucks, cash.

08:23.239 --> 08:26.990
So, why didn't you sign in
at the rec center that day?

08:26.991 --> 08:29.125
I... I don't know.

08:29.562 --> 08:31.127
I guess I just forgot.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.961
But I was there.

08:32.996 --> 08:34.929
It was raining, we were all inside.

08:34.965 --> 08:37.033
I was watching the game with Patrick.

08:37.068 --> 08:38.933
We were yelling at the refs,

08:38.969 --> 08:40.135
'cause Griffin kept getting fouled

08:40.171 --> 08:41.736
and they weren't calling it.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.705
Do you know if he still works there?

08:43.741 --> 08:45.141
I don't know.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.143
I'm sure we can track him down.

08:47.178 --> 08:51.013
You think if he says I was there...

08:51.049 --> 08:53.815
I might get a new trial?

08:53.851 --> 08:54.983
Maybe.

08:57.121 --> 08:59.922
Hey, I... I brought you a book.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.058
They said they'd give it to you.

09:02.093 --> 09:03.959
Sideways Stories from Wayside School,

09:03.994 --> 09:04.993
remember it?

09:05.029 --> 09:06.695
Yeah. We loved that book.

09:06.730 --> 09:07.896
I must have read it 10 times.

09:07.932 --> 09:08.964
Except Jude. Jude...

09:08.999 --> 09:10.699
Hated it, yeah.

09:10.734 --> 09:12.101
- How is Jude?
- He's good.

09:12.136 --> 09:13.969
- He's tall.
- No way.

09:14.004 --> 09:16.138
- He's like taller than me now..
- Wow!

09:18.076 --> 09:19.808
Time's up, Kyle.

09:19.843 --> 09:21.777
I'll come see you again.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.745
I won't be here.

09:23.781 --> 09:26.782
I turn 18 next month, so...

09:26.817 --> 09:28.817
they're moving me to Folsom Prison.

09:30.221 --> 09:33.122
We'll talk to Molloy. We'll find him.

09:34.192 --> 09:36.959
Just... hang on, okay?

09:41.932 --> 09:43.966
So, dad is not having an affair.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.101
Told ya.

09:45.136 --> 09:47.002
He's been sneaking around

09:47.037 --> 09:48.870
'cause he's putting together this video

09:48.906 --> 09:50.106
for mom's retirement party.

09:50.141 --> 09:51.907
Honest to God, made me want to cry.

09:51.942 --> 09:54.776
He's got everyone sending
these little video clips

09:54.812 --> 09:57.179
saying nice things about her.

09:57.215 --> 09:59.748
Isn't that the sweetest
thing you ever heard?

09:59.783 --> 10:00.916
Yeah, it is.

10:00.951 --> 10:02.050
So, what do I do?

10:02.086 --> 10:05.053
Do I tell her that's
what he's been up to

10:05.089 --> 10:06.855
so she stops acting so paranoid?

10:06.890 --> 10:08.957
Well, kind of ruins the
surprise, doesn't it?

10:08.993 --> 10:10.859
That's true.

10:10.894 --> 10:13.095
Okay, I'm just going to stay out of it.

10:13.131 --> 10:16.098
It's usually for the best where
my parents are concerned, anyway.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.975
Did you know that many of
the British codebreakers

10:27.011 --> 10:29.245
during World War II were women?

10:29.280 --> 10:33.149
As were many of the first
NASA mathematicians

10:33.184 --> 10:36.051
- and engineers.
- Seriously?

10:36.086 --> 10:38.020
Not that you'd ever read about
them in the history books.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.221
It's still a man's world.

10:39.257 --> 10:41.823
Well, in STEM Club it is, anyway.

10:41.859 --> 10:45.093
Which, my dears, is why you
need to kick those boys' asses.

10:45.129 --> 10:46.862
Oh, we will, Gram.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.164
Okay.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.865
So here's an idea.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.793
Everyone else is gonna
design their robots

10:51.794 --> 10:53.135
to scoop up the blocks, right?

10:53.171 --> 10:54.203
Hey.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.172
Well, what if we used

10:56.207 --> 10:57.806
these instead?

10:57.841 --> 11:00.142
We could attach the zip
ties to the pipes,

11:00.178 --> 11:01.877
arrange them vertically,

11:01.912 --> 11:04.180
and if we could program the pipes
to spin around fast enough...

11:04.215 --> 11:06.182
It acts like a vacuum.

11:06.217 --> 11:08.083
We'd win for sure.

11:08.118 --> 11:09.218
That's kind of brilliant.

11:09.253 --> 11:12.154
But no way the ties can lift the block.

11:12.190 --> 11:14.923
What if you used these instead?

11:14.958 --> 11:16.925
We don't need a boy's help.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.196
Yeah, and how do you suppose
that we attach this around this?

11:20.231 --> 11:23.131
Fine. So, you wanna hang?

11:23.167 --> 11:25.867
I'm kind of busy here, Jesus.

11:25.903 --> 11:27.936
Yeah, boy toy, run along.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.074

11:37.114 --> 11:38.180
Hey...

11:38.216 --> 11:40.982
Okay, we're making a
video for mama's party.

11:41.018 --> 11:43.051
Like the party that's tomorrow?

11:43.087 --> 11:45.053
Yes, and I need you to edit it for me.

11:45.089 --> 11:46.088
Well, I can't.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.889
And shouldn't you have gotten on this

11:47.925 --> 11:48.957
like weeks ago?

11:48.992 --> 11:52.160
Yes, Mariana, but I
just thought of it now.

11:53.231 --> 11:55.163
Okay, well... get Jude to do it.

11:55.199 --> 11:56.865
Do what?

12:00.938 --> 12:02.070
Mama's birthday video.

12:02.106 --> 12:04.072
I just need one of my
computer-savvy children

12:04.108 --> 12:06.808
who loves me...

12:06.844 --> 12:08.910
to help me put it together.
What do you say?

12:08.946 --> 12:11.813
Okay. I can try.

12:11.849 --> 12:12.881
Really?

12:12.916 --> 12:14.149
I've never edited anything, but...

12:14.184 --> 12:15.884
I might know someone who can help.

12:15.919 --> 12:17.786
- Yeah?
- Who?

12:17.821 --> 12:18.987
Noah.

12:26.864 --> 12:30.132
Oh, hi. Brandon just left.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.834
That's okay, I actually
wanted to talk to you,

12:32.870 --> 12:34.069
if that would be all right.

12:35.105 --> 12:37.038
Yeah, come in.

12:38.143 --> 12:39.174
Sorry.

12:39.209 --> 12:42.077
- That's all right.
- We were just playing earlier.

12:44.248 --> 12:45.247
How you doing?

12:45.283 --> 12:46.948
Good. How are you?

12:46.984 --> 12:48.183
I'm well, thanks.

12:48.218 --> 12:52.020
I wanted to invite you to
Lena's birthday party.

12:52.055 --> 12:53.789
It would mean a lot to her

12:53.824 --> 12:56.858
and to me, of course, if you would come.

12:56.894 --> 12:59.995
So, it's a '70s theme party.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.063
Don't know how quickly
you can get together

13:02.099 --> 13:04.099
a pair of bellbottoms
on such short notice,

13:04.134 --> 13:07.002
but it would be great if you could come.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.870
Thank you. Yeah...

13:08.906 --> 13:10.739
I'd love to come.

13:10.775 --> 13:11.973
Great! Okay.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.846
Sorry, this is work. Do you mind?

13:17.881 --> 13:19.915
No, no, sure, no problem.

13:19.950 --> 13:21.784
Hello? Hey.

13:30.841 --> 13:34.181
_

13:45.394 --> 13:48.295
Hi. Are you Patrick Molloy?

13:48.330 --> 13:49.329
Yes.

13:49.364 --> 13:51.331
Hi, I'm Callie Adams Foster,

13:51.366 --> 13:53.066
and this is Aaron Baker.

13:53.102 --> 13:55.002
We talked to a friend of
yours at the rec center,

13:55.037 --> 13:56.136
said we could find you here.

13:56.172 --> 13:57.437
Okay.

13:57.472 --> 13:59.273
We're friends of Kyle Snow.

13:59.308 --> 14:01.175
Do you remember him?

14:01.210 --> 14:04.278
Yeah. He killed that lady, right?

14:04.313 --> 14:05.445
He was found guilty,

14:05.480 --> 14:07.147
but we don't think he
was given a fair trial.

14:07.183 --> 14:10.083
Kyle says he was with
you at the rec center

14:10.119 --> 14:12.252
on the day that Mrs.
Johnson was murdered.

14:12.288 --> 14:14.321
And you were watching a Clippers game.

14:14.356 --> 14:15.989
Do you remember that?

14:16.025 --> 14:17.257
Yeah, I do.

14:17.293 --> 14:20.227
It was raining, so all
the kids were inside.

14:20.262 --> 14:22.095
It was crazy.

14:22.131 --> 14:23.197
But I...

14:23.232 --> 14:25.265
I don't remember Kyle being there.

14:25.301 --> 14:27.067
Are you sure?

14:27.102 --> 14:30.403
He said that you were
complaining about the refs?

14:30.439 --> 14:32.072
Sorry.

14:32.107 --> 14:34.174
Would it have been possible

14:34.210 --> 14:37.110
for a kid to be at the rec
center and forget to sign in?

14:37.146 --> 14:38.445
Yeah, sure. I mean, if it was busy

14:38.480 --> 14:41.315
and nobody noticed, that could happen.

14:41.350 --> 14:43.250
Okay, thank you.

14:43.285 --> 14:45.219
He was a nice kid.

14:45.254 --> 14:47.087
I wish I could help.

14:47.122 --> 14:49.022
Thanks.

14:52.394 --> 14:54.194
Look, it was four years ago.

14:54.230 --> 14:57.030
It's possible he just doesn't
remember seeing Kyle,

14:57.066 --> 14:59.299
but it doesn't mean
that he wasn't there.

14:59.335 --> 15:01.335
I just really thought for a second...

15:01.370 --> 15:04.404
I guess nothing's ever that simple.

15:04.439 --> 15:06.173
Or fair.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.375
Well, maybe there's something else.

15:08.410 --> 15:09.977
Another hole in the case.

15:10.012 --> 15:11.311
Listen, you don't have to do this.

15:11.347 --> 15:13.146
Maybe I want to.

15:13.182 --> 15:15.048
I really do have a boyfriend.

15:15.084 --> 15:18.285
Okay. I really do want to help.

15:19.989 --> 15:22.256
I've been in juvie twice.

15:22.291 --> 15:25.192
It was pretty awful.

15:25.227 --> 15:28.328
But Folsom, it's gotta be hell.

15:28.364 --> 15:30.430
Just don't know if he'll make it.

15:38.107 --> 15:40.407
What can I say about Lena?
She's perfect.

15:40.442 --> 15:43.110
And it's weird because
that is usually something

15:43.145 --> 15:44.444
I hate in a person.

15:44.479 --> 15:46.980
I mean, really, what's more ho...

15:47.016 --> 15:48.148
She's a trip.

15:48.183 --> 15:50.050
You have no idea.

15:50.085 --> 15:53.353
Okay, so you move the cursor
to where you want the cut

15:53.389 --> 15:56.123
and then you can dissolve
or fade or whatever.

15:56.158 --> 15:57.457
Hey, thanks for showing me all this.

15:57.492 --> 16:00.961
No problem. I do this kind of
stuff for my church all the time.

16:02.398 --> 16:03.397
What?

16:03.432 --> 16:04.932
Nothing.

16:04.967 --> 16:05.999
No, what?

16:07.236 --> 16:09.236
I was online and...

16:09.271 --> 16:11.271
I saw that Connor's in San Diego.

16:11.307 --> 16:13.373
Did he tell you he's coming?

16:15.277 --> 16:17.411
Who's Connor?

16:17.446 --> 16:21.381
He's, my ex... boyfriend.

16:21.417 --> 16:25.118
He moved to L.A., so we broke up.

16:32.127 --> 16:33.427
Hey, did you find
something strong enough

16:33.462 --> 16:35.395
to lift your cube with?

16:35.431 --> 16:38.265
No, we're trying something else.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.334
What if you don't have to?

16:40.369 --> 16:43.270
I figured why go around the pipe

16:43.305 --> 16:45.005
if you could go through it?

17:18.272 --> 17:20.940
19 seconds. That's the time to beat.

17:22.077 --> 17:23.242
You're next.

17:27.449 --> 17:29.249
What?

17:29.284 --> 17:31.151
You've got to be kidding me.

17:32.287 --> 17:34.187
We got this.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.090
You ready?

17:54.574 --> 17:57.244
Nine seconds. That's great.

17:59.281 --> 18:02.282
I'm sorry, did you say
something earlier?

18:03.419 --> 18:05.018
I didn't think so.

18:06.188 --> 18:07.187
Yeah.

18:10.392 --> 18:11.925
Name?

18:11.960 --> 18:13.026
Tristan Chacones.

18:25.107 --> 18:26.373
Good luck.

18:26.442 --> 18:28.175
Thank you.

18:34.416 --> 18:36.349
So, I've tallied all the votes,

18:36.385 --> 18:38.251
combined that with the
points earned for speed,

18:38.287 --> 18:41.020
and... we have a winner.

18:41.056 --> 18:43.957
Aiden, Dan, and Jeffrey.

18:43.992 --> 18:47.427
Our robot completed the task
in less than half the time,

18:47.463 --> 18:50.097
and it couldn't have done that
without the superior design

18:50.132 --> 18:51.364
and creativity.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.234
True, but those are
subjective assessments.

18:54.269 --> 18:56.269
Maybe, but ours was also autonomous.

18:56.305 --> 18:58.271
That's worth double the
points in competition.

18:58.307 --> 19:00.140
If Anchor Beach is gonna
beat these bigger schools,

19:00.175 --> 19:02.342
we can't do it with the same designs

19:02.377 --> 19:04.043
and same old strategies.

19:04.079 --> 19:06.113
We've gotta be different.

19:09.951 --> 19:13.286
You know what? You're right.

19:13.322 --> 19:15.288
And I apologize.

19:18.327 --> 19:20.927
I'm overturning the club's decision.

19:20.962 --> 19:22.496
- Are you serious?
- Look, I get it,

19:22.531 --> 19:24.397
but you should have voted for them in
the first place, and you know that.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.266
- Oh, my God!
- All right. Congratulations.

19:26.301 --> 19:29.035
Really?

19:29.070 --> 19:30.337
Way to play the girl card.

19:42.789 --> 19:44.184
Brandon?

19:45.454 --> 19:47.387
Hey! Brandon!

20:05.468 --> 20:07.368
Damn! Oh, my God.

20:07.739 --> 20:10.640
Come here. Gimme some sugar.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.942
Oh, watch the lips.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.977
That lipstick took me a
half-hour, believe it or not.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.979
Oh, come on now.

20:16.014 --> 20:17.113
Oh, will you get that?

20:17.148 --> 20:19.716
Yeah. Hello.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.052
No, I don't think so.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.755
Honey, did you order a house appraisal?

20:25.791 --> 20:27.023
No. Why would I get our house appraised?

20:27.058 --> 20:30.026
Sorry, I think there
must be some mistake.

20:30.061 --> 20:32.896
Oh, probably my fault.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.064
We'll have to call you back.

20:36.624 --> 20:37.990
You're getting our house appraised?

20:38.025 --> 20:41.594
I completely forgot to mention it.
My apology.

20:41.629 --> 20:45.664
Dana and I are switching
financial advisors,

20:45.700 --> 20:48.567
and we're restructuring our trust

20:48.603 --> 20:50.969
and putting all our ducks in a row,

20:51.005 --> 20:52.705
for retirement, you know.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.006
Okay.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.876
And this new guy, he
wants a complete list

20:56.911 --> 20:59.812
of all of our assets and our obligations

20:59.847 --> 21:01.514
and that includes the house,

21:01.549 --> 21:03.716
because I'm co-borrower on the loan,

21:03.751 --> 21:05.818
so he's probably just
being overly thorough,

21:05.853 --> 21:06.985
that's all.

21:11.992 --> 21:13.992
Stop it. Where is the bar?

21:24.872 --> 21:26.639
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna lie.

21:26.674 --> 21:28.741
I kind of can't wait for my
mom to eat a little crow

21:28.776 --> 21:31.677
when she finds out why my
dad's been acting so weird.

21:31.712 --> 21:34.814
I'm just confused. Why would
he list our house as an asset?

21:34.849 --> 21:37.850
I guess because technically it is.

21:39.821 --> 21:40.920
Well...

21:51.699 --> 21:53.699
- You like?
- I love!

21:53.734 --> 21:55.000
You didn't have to do all this.

21:55.035 --> 21:57.570
You only turn 40 once, baby.

21:58.806 --> 22:00.806
Mr. Saturday Night Fever himself!

22:00.842 --> 22:02.508
Look at that!

22:02.543 --> 22:04.643
Ironic, given the fact
that I don't really dance.

22:04.679 --> 22:05.978
Hey, I get one birthday wish,

22:06.013 --> 22:07.613
and it's to see you do the Hustle.

22:07.648 --> 22:09.715
Well, that's sad, but
for you, I'll do it.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.751
Be careful what you wish
for 'cause I've seen it.

22:18.659 --> 22:19.725
You invited Gabe?

22:19.760 --> 22:21.694
Yeah, he's been here all week working,

22:21.729 --> 22:23.896
so Lena thought it would
be nice to invite him.

22:23.931 --> 22:25.764
You know?

22:27.001 --> 22:28.601
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:28.636 --> 22:30.736
Don't get to the gym much?

22:32.006 --> 22:34.740
So that's why he didn't tell
me he was in San Diego.

22:34.775 --> 22:36.575
He came with his new boyfriend.

22:36.611 --> 22:37.643
Gross.

22:37.678 --> 22:38.911
The least he could have done is told me

22:38.946 --> 22:40.713
instead of letting me
find out like this.

22:42.016 --> 22:43.949
Hey, you made it.

22:43.985 --> 22:45.684
Of course.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.853
All right, cuteness overload.

22:47.889 --> 22:50.623
You two, get together.

22:50.658 --> 22:51.824
Come on.

23:02.637 --> 23:03.669
Wow!

23:04.939 --> 23:06.772
Really? It's not too...

23:06.807 --> 23:07.973
Debbie Harry?

23:08.009 --> 23:09.808
I have no idea who that is.

23:09.844 --> 23:11.577
All I know is I like what I see.

23:11.612 --> 23:13.712
Back atcha, stud.

23:13.748 --> 23:15.848
Did you hear that we beat
the boys in STEM today?

23:15.883 --> 23:18.784
Yeah, Mariana practically
called a press conference.

23:18.819 --> 23:21.854
Well, we couldn't have
done it without your help.

23:21.889 --> 23:22.855
Perhaps I could do

23:22.890 --> 23:24.790
a little something for you.

23:24.825 --> 23:27.626
You know, to thank you?

23:28.863 --> 23:31.964
Yeah, yeah, I can probably
think of something.

23:31.999 --> 23:37.703
And also, maybe, I could
start tutoring you again.

23:37.738 --> 23:39.638
Wait, what?

23:39.674 --> 23:43.542
So you can get a head
start for the SATs.

23:49.050 --> 23:50.683
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:50.718 --> 23:51.984
I don't want this to be weird.

23:52.019 --> 23:54.687
I mean, it's not weird for me.

23:54.722 --> 23:58.523
No, I totally agree. It doesn't
have to be weird at all.

23:58.559 --> 23:59.692
So...

23:59.727 --> 24:01.594
You seeing anybody?

24:01.629 --> 24:03.729
Yeah, I'm dating.

24:03.764 --> 24:05.864
Oh, hell no!

24:05.900 --> 24:07.933
It's my ex,

24:07.969 --> 24:10.869
with some barely pubescent girlfriend.

24:11.739 --> 24:13.706
Excuse me.

24:17.544 --> 24:18.844
No, no, no, no!

24:18.879 --> 24:21.947
I'm not gonna be the only
people on the dance floor.

24:21.983 --> 24:23.682
Come on, look.

24:23.718 --> 24:25.618
I've been watching those old
Soul Train videos on YouTube.

24:25.653 --> 24:26.652
Have you?

24:26.687 --> 24:27.653
Let me show you what I got.

24:27.688 --> 24:28.921
Hey, guys.

24:29.957 --> 24:31.724
What?

24:31.759 --> 24:33.759
No, it's a nice perm.

24:33.794 --> 24:35.828
Oh, he's Greg Brady.

24:35.863 --> 24:37.863
It was her idea.

24:37.898 --> 24:39.732
Who's Greg Brady?

24:39.767 --> 24:40.866
Hey, be right back.

24:40.901 --> 24:42.635
Okay.

24:43.128 --> 24:45.063
FROM AARON:
YOU HOME?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.606
Excuse me.

24:49.043 --> 24:53.012
Hey, so I just wanted to thank you

24:53.047 --> 24:54.713
for inviting Cort.

24:54.749 --> 24:56.915
It meant a lot to her.

24:56.951 --> 24:58.717
And me.

24:59.787 --> 25:01.620
Of course, yeah.

25:03.758 --> 25:06.892
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
tell Mama happy birthday.

25:06.927 --> 25:08.661
Bye.

25:09.764 --> 25:12.798
Okay, so why don't you like her?

25:12.833 --> 25:15.734
She seems nice enough, I guess.

25:16.971 --> 25:18.871
She's taken advantage of him.

25:18.906 --> 25:21.506
How so?

25:23.644 --> 25:25.744
Lena doesn't know this and I
didn't want to ruin her party,

25:25.780 --> 25:27.780
but...

25:27.815 --> 25:28.981
she's...

25:30.584 --> 25:33.585
He's using his money to pay her bills.

25:34.755 --> 25:35.754
What bills?

25:35.790 --> 25:39.591
So, thank you for
inviting all of my exes.

25:39.626 --> 25:41.827
I thought I was the one who
got you in the divorce.

25:41.862 --> 25:42.961
Sorry.

25:42.997 --> 25:45.864
Hey, how'd it go today? The SATs.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.966
I saw you when I was picking up Garrett.

25:48.002 --> 25:51.603
Yeah, I think it went pretty well.

25:51.638 --> 25:53.806
You took the SATs today?

25:53.841 --> 25:55.607
Yeah...

25:55.642 --> 25:57.910
You know, I just wanted to take it again

25:57.945 --> 26:00.579
and see if I could improve my scores.

26:00.614 --> 26:03.749
God, I practically had to bribe Garrett

26:03.784 --> 26:05.617
to get him to take it even once.

26:05.652 --> 26:06.685
All rightie.

26:08.723 --> 26:11.523
I am going to go get a refill.

26:11.558 --> 26:13.658
Anyone?

26:14.995 --> 26:16.862
Okay.

26:19.967 --> 26:20.933
Hey.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.637
Nice get-up.

26:25.672 --> 26:28.506
Oh, no, we're having a costume party

26:28.542 --> 26:29.708
for my mom's birthday.

26:29.744 --> 26:31.576
Oh, sorry, I can leave.

26:31.612 --> 26:33.979
No, I was actually trying to
stay off the dance floor,

26:34.014 --> 26:35.614
so come in.

26:39.653 --> 26:41.519
So, what's up?

26:41.555 --> 26:43.989
Kyle's lawyer did speak
to Patrick Molloy.

26:44.024 --> 26:46.859
Four years ago. These are his notes.

26:46.894 --> 26:49.828
Molloy said he remembered
seeing Kyle at the rec center

26:49.864 --> 26:51.864
on March 23rd 'cause they were watching

26:51.899 --> 26:53.799
the Clippers-Warriors game together,

26:53.834 --> 26:55.533
just like Kyle said.

26:55.569 --> 26:58.603
Wha... where did you find this?

26:58.639 --> 27:01.975
Remember Sheila told us that she
had all of Kyle's old files in the garage?

27:01.976 --> 27:05.944
I did a little digging through
them, and there it was.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.846
Oh, my God, thank you.

27:07.882 --> 27:11.483
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

27:13.654 --> 27:16.588
Hey... AJ, this is Aaron.

27:16.623 --> 27:17.956
Aaron, this is AJ, my boyfriend.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.825
Hey.

27:20.304 --> 27:21.726
So you do exist.

27:32.412 --> 27:34.379
Look at them. God.

27:34.414 --> 27:36.949
She does know Little Miss Stripy Pants

27:36.984 --> 27:38.951
only makes her look older, doesn't she?

27:38.986 --> 27:40.285
I don't get it.

27:40.321 --> 27:41.987
Yeah, I'm actually gonna go...

27:43.054 --> 27:45.224
Now, that, on the other hand!

27:45.259 --> 27:49.261
If I weren't gay, I'd climb
him like a jungle gym.

27:49.296 --> 27:51.163
You coming?

27:51.198 --> 27:53.265
Nah, I'm gonna sit this one out.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.934
Not me.

28:04.912 --> 28:08.113
Mom, come dance with me and Daddy.

28:08.148 --> 28:10.115
He can't ask me himself?

28:12.219 --> 28:13.318
This is silly.

28:13.354 --> 28:16.121
Mom, Dad is not having an affair.

28:16.156 --> 28:18.290
He's just busy with retirement

28:18.325 --> 28:20.225
and restructuring the trust

28:20.261 --> 28:21.927
and getting a new business manager.

28:21.962 --> 28:23.262
There's a lot on his plate.

28:23.297 --> 28:26.899
What new business manager?
What are you talking about?

28:26.934 --> 28:30.302
He didn't tell me
anything about all that.

28:30.337 --> 28:34.940
So, you're doing okay, after
everything that happened with Nick?

28:36.143 --> 28:38.977
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

28:39.013 --> 28:41.113
I kind of wish people
would stop asking me.

28:41.148 --> 28:43.949
Okay, good.

28:43.984 --> 28:46.919
But you and Mat, you're
back together, right?

28:46.954 --> 28:48.220
Where is he?

28:48.255 --> 28:51.056
We are. College tour.

28:52.393 --> 28:55.260
Speaking of getting back together...

28:55.296 --> 28:57.930
did you ever think maybe...

28:57.965 --> 28:59.298
you and Gabe?

28:59.333 --> 29:01.833
'Cause I mean it would
kind of be crazy romantic.

29:01.868 --> 29:04.036
Don't let Mike hear you say that.

29:04.071 --> 29:05.870
Why?

29:07.274 --> 29:09.308
Oh, my God, are...

29:09.343 --> 29:11.977
you and Mike like "a thing"?

29:12.012 --> 29:13.078
Maybe?

29:13.113 --> 29:14.246
Oh, is that okay?

29:14.281 --> 29:17.149
Yeah, of course, I love Mike.

29:19.286 --> 29:21.019
Me too.

29:22.089 --> 29:23.221
You're in love.

29:23.257 --> 29:25.090
I haven't told him yet.

29:27.194 --> 29:29.061
Our secret, I promise.

29:42.485 --> 29:43.562
UPDATE STATUS

29:48.561 --> 29:51.446
EDIT PROFILE:
IN A RELATIONSHIP

29:58.092 --> 30:01.193
Hello. You must be Cortney.

30:01.228 --> 30:03.295
I'm Brandon's grandmother, Dana Adams.

30:03.330 --> 30:06.064
Oh, it's so nice to meet you, Mrs. Adams.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.200
I've heard so much about you.

30:08.235 --> 30:11.169
Really? And all I know about you is that

30:11.205 --> 30:13.038
you're a young married mother

30:13.073 --> 30:15.907
allowing your high-school-age boyfriend

30:15.942 --> 30:18.043
to pay for your divorce.

30:23.150 --> 30:25.150
You don't think it's a little weird

30:25.185 --> 30:26.951
that my mom didn't know
anything about my dad

30:26.987 --> 30:28.186
getting them a new business manager?

30:28.222 --> 30:30.122
I don't know, love.

30:30.157 --> 30:33.025
Maybe he's the one that
handles the finances.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.359
That's what Kelly did.

30:34.395 --> 30:36.328
Right before she left me.

30:36.363 --> 30:40.065
She started moving money
around and hiding it.

30:42.336 --> 30:44.069
If I were paying more attention,

30:44.104 --> 30:46.938
I would have known she
was gonna divorce me.

30:51.378 --> 30:54.112
Hey, why aren't you dancing?

30:54.148 --> 30:55.213
I don't know.

30:55.249 --> 30:56.381
Just too dumb, I guess.

31:00.354 --> 31:02.154
So, how could Molloy forget

31:02.189 --> 31:04.222
giving this statement to Kyle's lawyer?

31:04.258 --> 31:08.193
Maybe he didn't. Maybe
he changed his story.

31:08.228 --> 31:10.228
Why would he do that?

31:10.264 --> 31:11.896
Could be anything.

31:11.932 --> 31:13.998
Maybe he was being
intimidated by someone.

31:14.034 --> 31:15.267
Like who?

31:15.302 --> 31:17.069
I don't know. A prosecutor?

31:17.104 --> 31:19.237
Or maybe he was protecting someone.

31:19.273 --> 31:23.007
Like if he had something to hide.

31:23.043 --> 31:25.143
All right, you young people,
I know that the '70s

31:25.179 --> 31:27.245
is probably just a chapter
in your history books,

31:27.281 --> 31:29.481
but the dance floor
beckons, let's go!

31:30.140 --> 31:31.405
Don't have to tell me twice.

31:31.461 --> 31:32.868
- All right.
- I'll see you out there.

31:32.908 --> 31:34.286
Yeah, I'll be out in a second.

31:34.321 --> 31:35.987
And who is this?

31:36.022 --> 31:37.922
I'm Aaron, Mrs. Adams Foster.

31:37.958 --> 31:41.260
Oh, Aaron who took my daughter
for a ride on his motorcycle Aaron.

31:41.261 --> 31:42.994
Yeah.

31:43.029 --> 31:46.164
We were just looking at
a few of Kyle's case files,

31:46.200 --> 31:50.935
and we found this guy, this
witness, who changed his story.

31:50.971 --> 31:53.271
Do you think you could check him
out, see if he has a record?

31:53.307 --> 31:57.008
Sure. When it's not Mama's
birthday, all right?

31:57.043 --> 31:58.910
You're welcome to stay, Aaron.

31:58.945 --> 32:03.081
Oh, thanks, but I should
probably head out.

32:03.117 --> 32:04.116
Okay.

32:05.986 --> 32:07.252
Sorry.

32:07.287 --> 32:10.054
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

32:10.090 --> 32:11.089
What?

32:11.125 --> 32:14.259
So, what are we calling you guys?

32:14.294 --> 32:15.293
Judah?

32:15.329 --> 32:16.328
Maybe Juno?

32:16.363 --> 32:19.197
Juno?

32:19.233 --> 32:21.099
Well, if you're changing
your relationship status,

32:21.135 --> 32:24.102
you've got to come up with
a couple name, right?

32:26.240 --> 32:28.373
Are you cheating on Mom?

32:28.408 --> 32:30.108
What? No!

32:30.144 --> 32:32.110
Then why does she think you are?

32:32.146 --> 32:33.378
Are you planning on leaving her?

32:33.413 --> 32:37.015
Why doesn't she know about the
new business manager, Dad?

32:37.050 --> 32:39.050
What are you two talking about?

32:39.085 --> 32:43.188
Dana, honey, I'm not cheating on you.

32:43.223 --> 32:44.356
Who said you were?

32:44.391 --> 32:47.025
Mom.

32:47.060 --> 32:50.262
Okay, there is something that
I've been keeping from you.

32:51.331 --> 32:53.064
Both of you.

32:53.799 --> 32:55.167
Are you okay, Dad?

33:01.568 --> 33:03.324
Noah, please, don't go.

33:03.325 --> 33:05.325
Look, I don't know what's going
on with you and your ex,

33:05.360 --> 33:08.243
but, dude, leave me out of it.

33:08.244 --> 33:09.477
I'm really sorry.

33:09.512 --> 33:12.413
I didn't want him to think I
was sitting around and...

33:12.449 --> 33:14.348
crying about him or something.

33:14.383 --> 33:17.217
I get wanting to make him feel jealous.

33:18.421 --> 33:20.354
But I hate social media.

33:20.389 --> 33:21.388
Why?

33:21.424 --> 33:23.123
A lot of people don't like the fact

33:23.159 --> 33:24.592
that a minister's son is openly gay.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.461
And they tell me about it.

33:26.496 --> 33:29.464
I'll take it down, okay?
I didn't mean to...

33:29.499 --> 33:32.266
And if you're gonna go
around and tell everyone

33:32.301 --> 33:34.401
we're like boyfriends or whatever...

33:35.538 --> 33:37.304
you should at least ask me out first.

33:40.209 --> 33:41.542
I... should?

33:47.283 --> 33:49.484
Okay...

33:49.519 --> 33:52.219
would you like to go out sometime?

33:52.288 --> 33:54.321
That's better.

33:56.325 --> 34:00.194
I have some tax issues with the IRS.

34:01.297 --> 34:02.497
I owe some money.

34:02.532 --> 34:04.365
Wait, Dad.

34:05.602 --> 34:07.535
Why am I just finding this out now?

34:07.570 --> 34:10.170
I didn't wanna worry you, honey.

34:10.206 --> 34:13.373
You're not just talking about
your money, it's our money.

34:13.409 --> 34:16.275
Yes, I know perfectly well, Dana,

34:16.312 --> 34:17.478
but they were my mistakes.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.146
I wanted to find a solution,

34:19.181 --> 34:21.248
so we both didn't have to stress out.

34:21.283 --> 34:22.349
How much do we owe?

34:22.385 --> 34:23.551
Nothing I can't handle.

34:23.585 --> 34:26.120
That's why I wanted an
appraisal of the house.

34:26.155 --> 34:30.290
I know you and Stef must have
some equity in it by now.

34:30.326 --> 34:33.293
I can take out a line of credit
and pay it off, no problem.

34:33.329 --> 34:36.362
Except Stef and I already took out
a line of credit on the house.

34:36.399 --> 34:39.266
What? What for?

34:39.301 --> 34:42.436
The adoption fees for Callie and Jude.

34:42.471 --> 34:44.304
House repairs, the remodel.

34:44.340 --> 34:46.373
Day-to-day stuff with five kids, Dad.

34:46.409 --> 34:47.574
Oh, my God, Stewart.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.409
No, please, baby, don't worry!

34:49.445 --> 34:51.411
Stop telling me not to worry.

34:51.447 --> 34:52.478
We have a lot of options.

34:52.514 --> 34:55.215
I got us into this mess,
I can get us out.

34:56.351 --> 34:58.352
All right?

34:58.387 --> 35:01.221
Last thing I wanted to
do was ruin you party.

35:01.257 --> 35:04.258
Okay, if everybody could
gather around, please.

35:04.293 --> 35:05.459
Everybody. Got a little surprise

35:05.494 --> 35:08.162
for the birthday girl, wherever she is.

35:08.197 --> 35:11.265
Hi, my love.

35:12.468 --> 35:14.569
Wow, 40. You're in your 40s.

35:14.604 --> 35:17.304
You can tell me what that's
like maybe a little bit later.

35:18.608 --> 35:23.177
So, in honor of this totally
arbitrary milestone,

35:23.212 --> 35:26.313
your friends and family have put
together a bit of a tribute

35:26.348 --> 35:29.316
to show you just how
much you mean to them.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.523
Happy birthday, Mama. We love you.

35:36.559 --> 35:38.325
Are you seriously 40?

35:38.360 --> 35:39.526
That is crazy old.

35:39.562 --> 35:41.361
- Hey, don't be rude!
- What?

35:42.565 --> 35:44.599
Hey, you okay?

35:44.634 --> 35:47.401
Did you tell your grandmother
you paid for my lawyer?

35:47.436 --> 35:49.536
No. Why?

35:51.307 --> 35:52.506
You and Stef

35:52.541 --> 35:55.342
gave us the greatest gift
when you adopted us,

35:55.377 --> 35:58.412
so what can we give you
that even comes close?

35:58.447 --> 36:00.447
So we got you pot holders!

36:00.483 --> 36:02.382
Spoiler alert!

36:02.418 --> 36:03.517
We hope you like 'em.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.219
Yeah, you're welcome, Mama.

36:05.254 --> 36:06.487
- Happy birthday!
- We love you.

36:06.522 --> 36:09.189
Think anyone would notice if we
went upstairs for a little bit?

36:09.225 --> 36:10.390
It's my mom's party.

36:10.426 --> 36:13.193
I don't really feel like leaving, so...

36:13.229 --> 36:15.262
Maybe later?

36:15.297 --> 36:16.396
I don't think so.

36:16.432 --> 36:18.332
Matter of fact, I don't think

36:18.367 --> 36:20.167
this whole "friends with benefits" thing

36:20.202 --> 36:21.368
is working out for me.

36:21.403 --> 36:23.104
So...

36:23.139 --> 36:25.372
I had no idea what I was
going to say, so I will say,

36:25.407 --> 36:28.175
I love you very much. You're 40.

36:28.210 --> 36:31.211
And I am so lucky
to have you guys...

36:31.247 --> 36:33.213
...in my life. Happy birthday.

36:33.249 --> 36:34.481
Okay? We on?

36:34.517 --> 36:36.350
- Happy birthday, my love.
- Hey, darlin'.

36:36.385 --> 36:40.521
It was 40 years ago in
that, oh, cramped little

36:40.556 --> 36:43.423
birthing room at Sharp Memorial,

36:43.459 --> 36:46.426
when you grabbed my thumb

36:46.462 --> 36:48.328
with your tiny little hand,

36:48.364 --> 36:52.199
and I just felt a love I didn't
even know existed, baby.

36:52.234 --> 36:54.468
You know, you'll always,

36:54.503 --> 36:58.072
for me and your mom, always
be that tiny little baby.

36:58.107 --> 37:00.407
I'm just glad I don't have
to comb your hair anymore.

37:02.211 --> 37:04.478
- We love you, sweetie.
- We love you, baby.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.380
Happy birthday.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.597
HAPPY 40TH, LENA
DAMN, YOU'RE OLD!

37:10.286 --> 37:11.451
Mom?

37:11.487 --> 37:13.554
Mom, the cops are here.

37:13.589 --> 37:16.356
What? Can I help you?

37:16.392 --> 37:18.392
We're looking for a Lena Adams Foster.

37:18.427 --> 37:19.560
That's me.

37:19.595 --> 37:22.229
Mrs. Adams Foster,
you're under arrest...

37:22.264 --> 37:23.263
What?

37:23.299 --> 37:25.432
...for being way too hot.

37:25.467 --> 37:26.533
Yes!

37:26.569 --> 37:28.302
Oh, my...

37:28.337 --> 37:33.174
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Now this is a party!

37:33.209 --> 37:35.109
A party!

37:35.144 --> 37:37.277
Go, ladies. Go, ladies.

37:40.183 --> 37:42.216
Oh, yes!

37:42.251 --> 37:43.350
Make it rain!

37:43.385 --> 37:45.586
Ladies, make it rain!

37:46.931 --> 37:48.422
Oh, God help me!

37:48.457 --> 37:49.590
Go, ladies!

37:49.625 --> 37:52.326
Come on!

37:52.361 --> 37:54.461
Make it rain for mama. Come on!

37:54.496 --> 37:56.496
Go!

37:56.532 --> 38:00.267
Oh, God help me! Go!

38:04.340 --> 38:06.340
Hey... we're gonna go,

38:06.375 --> 38:08.542
but I wanna say happy birthday.

38:08.577 --> 38:10.477
Oh, thank you, honey!

38:10.512 --> 38:13.180
I'll be right back.

38:13.216 --> 38:14.314
Okay.

38:17.419 --> 38:19.486
So, how does Grandma know

38:19.521 --> 38:22.356
that I'm loaning Cort
money for her divorce?

38:22.391 --> 38:24.558
'Cause I told her.

38:24.593 --> 38:27.561
And how do you know?

38:30.133 --> 38:32.532
When I was at the apartment, yesterday,

38:32.568 --> 38:35.169
your checkbook was sitting on the table,

38:35.204 --> 38:36.336
so I looked at it.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.539
You had no right to do that.

38:41.310 --> 38:42.376
True.

38:43.412 --> 38:45.312
It's my money.

38:45.347 --> 38:47.481
It was.

38:48.056 --> 38:49.549
Stefanie Marie Adams Foster,

38:49.585 --> 38:51.385
may I please have this dance?

39:00.496 --> 39:03.230
See you later.

39:14.476 --> 39:16.510
Happy birthday.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.314
I don't quite know how to thank your mom

39:20.349 --> 39:22.316
for sending the cops.

39:26.588 --> 39:28.388
Hey.

39:28.424 --> 39:30.557
Will you please ask her to dance?

39:32.295 --> 39:34.094
I got two left feet.

39:34.130 --> 39:36.463
Come on, Ana doesn't care.
She loves you.

39:38.567 --> 39:41.368
I mean... you didn't hear it from me.

39:52.281 --> 39:53.547
Finally!

39:53.582 --> 39:58.152
Now, look, I may not have
Gabe's abs or his moves,

39:58.920 --> 40:00.554
but... let me finish.

40:02.410 --> 40:04.225
I love you, too.

40:08.464 --> 40:11.198
Mariana is dead to me.

40:18.407 --> 40:21.475
So, I was thinking, you
should join STEM Club.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.345
Yeah. You're hilarious.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.512
No, I'm being serious.

40:25.547 --> 40:27.248
You should join the robotics team.

40:27.283 --> 40:29.616
I think you'd be a really big asset.

40:54.510 --> 40:55.642
Hey, you wanna dance?

40:57.278 --> 40:59.066
Oh, come on.

40:59.067 --> 40:59.413
Yeah, you do.

40:59.448 --> 41:02.582
You wanna show me those
Soul Train moves?

41:02.618 --> 41:04.584
No? This one.

41:04.620 --> 41:07.388
Yeah? No, come on.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.556
How bad is it?

41:11.560 --> 41:14.494
There's a lien on their house.

41:14.530 --> 41:17.131
Are you saying...

41:18.401 --> 41:20.267
You mean they could lose their home?

41:33.127 --> 41:38.368
