<i>McKenzie: Previously on
Face Off All-Stars...</i>

00:03.349 --> 00:04.749
all: Whoa.

00:04.784 --> 00:07.084
<i>McKenzie: The artists
experimented with mad science.</i>

00:07.120 --> 00:08.553
It's alive!

00:10.023 --> 00:11.989
I feel like I'm building
my dream man.

00:12.025 --> 00:13.224
<i>McKenzie:
And Emily and Tyler's</i>

00:13.259 --> 00:14.926
<i>captivating characters
earned them immunity</i>

00:14.961 --> 00:17.428
<i>in this week's elimination
challenge.</i>

00:17.463 --> 00:19.463
<i>Tonight, the competition
goes into overdrive.</i>

00:19.499 --> 00:21.632
It totally is!
Yes!

00:21.668 --> 00:25.303
I'm flipping my shit right now.

00:25.338 --> 00:29.507
I'm just drawing
just a huge blank.

00:29.542 --> 00:31.943
<i>I'm just doing
everything I can not to</i>

00:31.978 --> 00:34.245
just, like, lose it.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.379
Fuck.

00:36.950 --> 00:39.650
We're doing things a little
differently tonight.

00:39.686 --> 00:41.953
Holy shit.
I didn't see this coming.

00:41.988 --> 00:43.688
<i>McKenzie:
Find out what happens next.</i>

01:29.502 --> 01:31.302
A whole lot of nothing out here.

01:31.337 --> 01:33.004
Yeah, I wonder what's up.

01:33.039 --> 01:34.472
Where's McKenzie?

01:34.507 --> 01:36.173
So we're out in the middle
of nowhere.

01:36.209 --> 01:38.709
<i>Don't know where we're at
or why we're out in the desert,</i>

01:38.745 --> 01:40.511
<i>and McKenzie's not there.</i>

01:40.546 --> 01:42.513
It's very weird.

01:44.851 --> 01:48.319
McKenzie!

01:48.354 --> 01:50.755
This is strange.

01:50.790 --> 01:52.990
Oh, look.
Well, there's something.

01:53.026 --> 01:55.026
- There is something.
- Oh.

01:55.061 --> 01:56.627
<i>We see this cloud of dirt</i>

01:56.663 --> 01:58.829
<i>and then there's a car
that's hauling ass,</i>

01:58.865 --> 02:00.631
but I have no idea
what's going on.

02:00.667 --> 02:02.266
Oh, it's coming over here.

02:02.301 --> 02:03.768
Oh, my goodness.

02:03.803 --> 02:05.236
Whoo.

02:05.271 --> 02:06.937
Ooh, McKenzie's driving.

02:06.973 --> 02:08.005
- Whoa.
- What?

02:09.342 --> 02:12.476
- Hey, guys.
- Sweet.

02:12.512 --> 02:15.012
- Pretty sweet ride, huh?
- Yeah.

02:15.048 --> 02:18.049
This is the bold new
Hyundai Veloster.

02:18.084 --> 02:20.117
- Oh.
- All right.

02:20.153 --> 02:23.688
Now as All-Stars, you all know
about constantly improving

02:23.723 --> 02:25.990
and reinventing yourselves
to excel at your art.

02:26.025 --> 02:28.259
And today is no exception,

02:28.294 --> 02:30.261
as you'll be taking
Hyundai's slogan,

02:30.296 --> 02:32.963
"We make things better,"
to heart.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.265
Be better.
Got it.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.666
Before I tell you more
about this challenge,

02:35.702 --> 02:38.803
I have something to show you.
Take a look.

02:41.174 --> 02:42.807
- I hear it.
- Something's coming.

02:42.842 --> 02:44.742
- It's a truck.
- Is that an army tank?

02:44.777 --> 02:46.811
- Stop it.
- Those are wasteland cars.

02:46.846 --> 02:48.879
Oh, my God.

02:48.915 --> 02:51.816
Tell me it is. Tell me it is.
It totally is! It totally is!

02:51.851 --> 02:53.751
Yes!

02:59.158 --> 03:02.827
My eye jellies want to burst
with excitement

03:02.862 --> 03:06.130
<i>because it's wasteland cars
like the "Mad Max" film,</i>

03:06.165 --> 03:09.900
and I am flipping my shit
right now.

03:09.936 --> 03:12.203
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

03:12.238 --> 03:14.038
All right.

03:14.073 --> 03:15.773
All: Yeah!

03:22.248 --> 03:24.515
- Pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

03:24.550 --> 03:26.417
All right, let's get
right into your challenge.

03:26.452 --> 03:28.886
In the dystopian
futuristic worlds

03:28.921 --> 03:32.356
created in films like "Mad Max"
and "Death Race,"

03:32.391 --> 03:35.159
cars are as important
to the stories

03:35.194 --> 03:37.361
as the drivers
that command them,

03:37.396 --> 03:39.730
so for this Spotlight Challenge,

03:39.766 --> 03:42.333
each team will choose
one of these remarkable

03:42.368 --> 03:45.436
post-apocalyptic vehicles
and create the wasteland warrior

03:45.471 --> 03:48.939
- that drives it.
- Yes!

03:48.975 --> 03:51.475
<i>I'm a huge fan
of the post-apocalyptic genre,</i>

03:51.511 --> 03:52.743
<i>and of course,
"Mad Max."</i>

03:52.779 --> 03:55.379
Big fan of "Fury Road"
and the original series,

03:55.414 --> 03:57.448
so this is exciting.

03:57.483 --> 04:00.451
All right, and before
you get too excited,

04:00.486 --> 04:01.519
there's more.

04:01.554 --> 04:03.187
- Of course, of course.
- Yeah.

04:03.222 --> 04:06.824
Just like Hyundai's
"We make things better" slogan,

04:06.859 --> 04:10.094
these futuristic drivers strive
to make their vehicles better

04:10.129 --> 04:13.364
in order to help their chances
of survival in a bleak world.

04:13.399 --> 04:15.800
Well, in this challenge,
I want you to bring

04:15.835 --> 04:18.636
that sense of ingenuity
to your makeups.

04:18.671 --> 04:22.540
Next to each vehicle is a trunk
containing various car parts.

04:22.575 --> 04:27.011
You must incorporate at least
three of them

04:27.046 --> 04:28.512
into your final makeups.

04:28.548 --> 04:29.747
- Cool.
- Okay.

04:29.782 --> 04:32.349
All right,
it's time to pick your vehicles.

04:32.385 --> 04:34.051
Keaghlan and Melissa,
you're first.

04:34.086 --> 04:35.519
Which one you want?

04:35.555 --> 04:36.787
I'm thinking the little one,
actually.

04:36.823 --> 04:38.823
Yeah.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.135
Okay, we'll go with this one.

04:51.170 --> 04:55.706
Before I go, I have one more
big surprise for you guys.

04:55.741 --> 04:59.109
This season's
grand prize includes

04:59.145 --> 05:02.947
the one and only
Hyundai Veloster.

05:02.982 --> 05:05.883
Yeah!

05:05.918 --> 05:08.452
Cool, right?

05:08.487 --> 05:10.554
All right, well, I'll leave
you here to work on your designs

05:10.590 --> 05:12.656
and go ahead and check out
the Veloster

05:12.692 --> 05:14.325
for a little winning
inspiration.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.727
- Yeah.
- Bye. Good luck.

05:16.762 --> 05:18.362
Let's go check out the Veloster.

05:18.397 --> 05:20.931
How is McKenzie getting home?

05:20.967 --> 05:22.867
You could fit,
like, two bodies in here.

05:22.902 --> 05:24.001
This car is sick.

05:24.036 --> 05:26.036
- Get in, Ben.
- It's got a third door.

05:26.072 --> 05:27.504
Such a nice car.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.740
<i>The car has so many
really interesting elements.</i>

05:29.775 --> 05:31.909
- Well, this is cool.
<i>- The navigation system,</i>

05:31.944 --> 05:33.811
<i>the sunroof, the three doors.</i>

05:33.846 --> 05:35.012
There's a lot of room
in this thing.

05:35.047 --> 05:37.381
It's cool. It looks like
a really cool ride

05:37.416 --> 05:38.816
<i>that any Face Off winner
could drive,</i>

05:38.851 --> 05:40.885
so hopefully it will be
Emily and I.

05:47.326 --> 05:48.459
Now what's in the box?

05:48.494 --> 05:50.127
- All right, what have we got?
- Ooh, shoot.

05:50.162 --> 05:51.929
- These are cool.
- Steering wheel.

05:51.964 --> 05:53.764
This is greasy and gross.

05:53.799 --> 05:55.866
Let's look at this car.

05:55.902 --> 05:57.334
We picked the monster carlo.

05:57.370 --> 06:00.971
It has this slingshot
that shoots rusty saw blades,

06:01.007 --> 06:02.706
<i>cool grated doors,</i>

06:02.742 --> 06:04.975
<i>and there's cigarette butts
littered everywhere.</i>

06:05.011 --> 06:07.778
This has to be
my favorite challenge ever.

06:07.813 --> 06:09.680
So it says, "Phoenix,"

06:09.715 --> 06:12.349
so somebody got burned
and rose from the ashes.

06:12.385 --> 06:13.584
Hmm.

06:13.619 --> 06:15.920
Our character's called
"Phoenix the Purifier,"

06:15.955 --> 06:20.557
and she's gonna be a bad-ass,
burned up, wasteland chick,

06:20.593 --> 06:23.594
<i>and now she's going out
to purify the evil</i>

06:23.629 --> 06:25.930
with fire and cigarettes.

06:25.965 --> 06:27.531
She, like,
put her cigarettes out

06:27.566 --> 06:29.500
and then used the ashes
as eye makeup.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.969
- Ohh, that's really cool.
- That's pretty bad-ass.

06:32.004 --> 06:34.805
Breaker 1-9,
we got an apocalypse coming.

06:36.008 --> 06:37.408
Shock absorber.

06:37.443 --> 06:39.310
These things in pairs are good.

06:39.345 --> 06:41.745
We have the motorcycle,
so I'm already excited.

06:41.781 --> 06:43.981
I know more about motorcycles
than Adam does,

06:44.016 --> 06:47.151
so I can help keep it grounded
in physics essentially.

06:47.186 --> 06:49.620
The thing that pops into my head

06:49.655 --> 06:50.988
this is this little samurai
influence, right?

06:51.023 --> 06:52.222
Okay.

06:52.258 --> 06:54.325
The character that is running
around in my head

06:54.360 --> 06:56.827
<i>is this samurai flag-bearer
without a master,</i>

06:56.862 --> 06:58.896
<i>like a ronin, like an outcast.</i>

06:58.931 --> 07:01.999
<i>We grab a timing belt,
we grab shock absorber covers,</i>

07:02.034 --> 07:03.567
and then we grab a fuel cone,

07:03.602 --> 07:06.704
which we should be able to use
for constructing armor,

07:06.739 --> 07:08.472
<i>and some huge samurai flags.</i>

07:08.507 --> 07:11.542
They're a little...

07:11.577 --> 07:13.043
drag-inducing.

07:13.079 --> 07:14.912
Logan's a little wary of that,

07:14.947 --> 07:17.881
<i>given drag and wind pressure
on a motorcycle,</i>

07:17.917 --> 07:19.283
<i>but it would be a cool visual.</i>

07:19.318 --> 07:20.918
<i>It would be
a cool silhouette to see,</i>

07:20.953 --> 07:24.822
<i>so I'm gonna go
with my instinct.</i>

07:27.927 --> 07:30.160
I do really like the idea
of this being a chestpiece

07:30.196 --> 07:31.462
- and protecting something.
- Yeah, me too.

07:31.497 --> 07:33.797
Gage and I pick a light cover,
a smoke alarm,

07:33.833 --> 07:36.467
and an "on and off" switch
to incorporate onto the chest.

07:36.502 --> 07:39.203
What if it's a system
that he uses to scavenge?

07:39.238 --> 07:42.506
So it's a detector
that detects, you know,

07:42.541 --> 07:44.508
whatever he's looking for.

07:44.543 --> 07:48.045
Our long car has this big cage
with bones in it.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.280
Awesome.
<i>Axes and NOS tanks on it.</i>

07:50.316 --> 07:52.549
<i>So our wasteland warrior
is a scavenger</i>

07:52.585 --> 07:54.485
<i>that collects
the most valuable resources,</i>

07:54.520 --> 07:56.353
<i>which are gasoline and water.</i>

07:56.389 --> 07:57.988
It's gonna need some piercings.

07:58.024 --> 07:59.857
- Cool.
- Rotted teeth.

07:59.892 --> 08:01.025
Yes, girl.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.127
We're so on the same page
with that.

08:06.966 --> 08:08.165
Okay, so I feel like

08:08.200 --> 08:11.135
maybe they could use
something as shade.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.771
The car doesn't have a roof.
It's like a dune buggy.

08:13.806 --> 08:17.608
It has horns,
and it just looks scary.

08:17.643 --> 08:20.244
I would like a female.
I think it'd be really pretty.

08:20.279 --> 08:22.246
Yeah, I feel like we should
really go with, like,

08:22.281 --> 08:23.781
a feather Mohawk dreaded.

08:23.816 --> 08:25.282
<i>The character that
we come up with</i>

08:25.317 --> 08:27.718
is Sava,
the huntress of the desert,

08:27.753 --> 08:29.853
<i>and we want to give her, like,
wire horns</i>

08:29.889 --> 08:31.789
<i>and make her a very</i>

08:31.824 --> 08:34.258
<i>over-the-top
powerful character.</i>

08:34.293 --> 08:37.260
I really like these for, like,
a chestpiece or something.

08:37.296 --> 08:40.530
We notice on the front of the
dune buggy it has these wings,

08:40.566 --> 08:42.666
<i>so we pick two grill pieces</i>

08:42.701 --> 08:45.402
<i>that look like a chestpiece
with the wings coming off,</i>

08:45.438 --> 08:48.172
so we have a pretty good idea
of where these pieces

08:48.207 --> 08:50.641
already are gonna fit into
our character.

08:50.676 --> 08:51.642
I like it.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.913
Ahh!

08:55.948 --> 08:58.015
I'm so excited.
I just want to drive this car.

08:58.050 --> 09:00.284
I want to get in it.
I want to play with the gun.

09:00.319 --> 09:02.419
Die, scum!

09:02.455 --> 09:04.254
It's... Ah, man,
this thing's so cool.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.423
- There's guns on the back, too.
- Oh, cool.

09:06.459 --> 09:08.525
This car is a rolling tank.

09:08.561 --> 09:10.194
<i>There's just bullets galore,</i>

09:10.229 --> 09:12.129
<i>so we want to incorporate
a lot of this in our character.</i>

09:12.164 --> 09:14.731
I like the idea of, like,
maybe, like, something happened

09:14.767 --> 09:16.834
to cause her to, like,
lose at least one limb.

09:16.869 --> 09:18.969
Maybe one of her arms is,
like, a gun.

09:19.004 --> 09:22.806
So we are gonna be doing
a machine gun arm,

09:22.842 --> 09:25.909
<i>and she'll have a scar
that runs all the way</i>

09:25.945 --> 09:28.011
into the back of her head
into her face.

09:28.047 --> 09:30.147
I want to utilize the wires.
I think that's a huge aspect

09:30.182 --> 09:31.348
- we can work with.
- Yes, for sure.

09:31.383 --> 09:33.083
<i>I really want to do well</i>

09:33.119 --> 09:35.185
because if we're in
the bottom again,

09:35.221 --> 09:38.055
we're probably going home,
and I'm not ready for that yet.

09:42.928 --> 09:44.928
That's cool.

09:44.964 --> 09:46.430
What was about this vehicle

09:46.465 --> 09:47.965
that got you so jazzed about it?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.835
I'm already just not very
inspired by what I'm seeing.

09:51.871 --> 09:53.170
You don't think
there's enough stuff on it?

09:53.205 --> 09:56.240
I mean, it's got,
like, roll thingy.

09:56.275 --> 10:00.010
I drawing just a huge blank
and it just really sucks.

10:00.045 --> 10:03.647
What if we did something
with, like, a dune buggy

10:03.682 --> 10:08.685
and made him, like, or her,
some kind of, like,

10:08.721 --> 10:11.855
I don't know, like...
I don't know.

10:11.891 --> 10:13.891
Right now, Evan and I
are feeling pretty uninspired,

10:13.926 --> 10:16.660
<i>and it's posing a really big
problem for us.</i>

10:16.695 --> 10:20.264
I'm done trying to think.
I don't...

10:20.299 --> 10:23.867
All right, everybody,
let's head out.

10:23.903 --> 10:25.169
It's really an internal struggle

10:25.204 --> 10:26.670
for each of us at this point.

10:26.705 --> 10:30.874
<i>We both have to find whatever
it is inside of ourselves</i>

10:30.910 --> 10:32.276
To move forward.

10:32.311 --> 10:35.312
I feel like this car's
a bad choice.

10:45.224 --> 10:48.125
Here's the base, so all of
this will be hair in here.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.493
- Okay.
- So black hair.

10:49.528 --> 10:51.361
Then the black caged horns.

10:51.397 --> 10:54.231
Yeah, so that... something...
I'll keep going with it.

10:54.266 --> 10:56.199
So our character
has these three horns

10:56.235 --> 10:59.002
<i>that were embedded
into her scalp,</i>

10:59.037 --> 11:01.505
<i>so I'm fabricating them
out of armature wire</i>

11:01.540 --> 11:04.474
<i>to give this tribal look
to the character.</i>

11:04.510 --> 11:05.842
Even though we have immunity,
Emily and I

11:05.878 --> 11:07.978
<i>don't want to hold back.</i>

11:11.517 --> 11:13.917
Sculpting a few
bullet holes too.

11:13.952 --> 11:17.120
I'm focusing on creating
our gloons and scars and cuts.

11:17.156 --> 11:20.424
<i>We just want her to look
like she's road-tough,</i>

11:20.459 --> 11:22.125
<i>and Melissa's gonna incorporate
the car parts</i>

11:22.161 --> 11:24.294
<i>into the machine gun arm.</i>

11:24.329 --> 11:26.163
We have to nail this one,

11:26.198 --> 11:28.598
or otherwise that nail
will seal our coffin.

11:28.634 --> 11:30.867
Go big or go home.

11:34.139 --> 11:35.806
Hi, everybody.

11:35.841 --> 11:37.474
- Hi.
- Hello.

11:37.509 --> 11:39.910
We got the VW Bug.

11:39.945 --> 11:41.511
<i>We just started on this,</i>

11:41.547 --> 11:43.447
<i>but this character's
The Inferno,</i>

11:43.482 --> 11:47.184
so he got burned,
so he constructed a suit

11:47.219 --> 11:49.352
that keeps him cool.

11:49.388 --> 11:52.322
We also want to just make sure
we're in the right direction.

11:52.357 --> 11:53.690
Well, that's a good story.

11:53.725 --> 11:56.793
You got a good start going here
on the nose here and the eye.

11:56.829 --> 11:59.196
You could take this back
a little bit further.

11:59.231 --> 12:00.897
You might pull this here
back here.

12:00.933 --> 12:03.433
Anywhere where there's skin,
it's either burned

12:03.469 --> 12:05.435
or it's hidden by clothes.
Yeah.

12:05.471 --> 12:07.337
After Mr. Westmore
comes through,

12:07.372 --> 12:09.172
we feel fairly confident
about our concept.

12:09.208 --> 12:12.209
<i>I think we're in
a much better place now.</i>

12:12.244 --> 12:13.643
Our character's called
The Raven.

12:13.679 --> 12:16.346
<i>She's a samurai-influenced
wasteland warrior.</i>

12:16.381 --> 12:17.948
What about colors?

12:17.983 --> 12:20.383
<i>Thought it'd be interesting
to bring makeup elements,</i>

12:20.419 --> 12:21.818
like war paint, or...

12:21.854 --> 12:25.355
Or to even incorporate tattoos
or something into the face.

12:25.390 --> 12:28.191
We got the biggest of the bunch.

12:28.227 --> 12:29.559
<i>He's a scavenger.</i>

12:29.595 --> 12:31.394
<i>He's gonna have
really sunburned skin</i>

12:31.430 --> 12:32.629
<i>- and chapped lips.
- Yeah.</i>

12:32.664 --> 12:34.631
The skin is essentially
growing over this, all over...

12:34.666 --> 12:36.600
You still need to do
something to the face.

12:36.635 --> 12:40.036
A piece that would be large
or broken.

12:40.072 --> 12:42.005
- The scar would come through...
- Yeah, we were talking

12:42.040 --> 12:43.807
about down through the eye.

12:43.842 --> 12:46.877
Even put a white eye in on
one side and lens in the other.

12:46.912 --> 12:48.178
Yeah, absolutely.

12:48.213 --> 12:50.046
She's Phoenix the Purifier.

12:50.082 --> 12:52.082
<i>- Risen from the ashes.
- Exactly.</i>

12:52.117 --> 12:54.818
<i>It's like bad-ass
warrior woman.</i>

12:54.853 --> 12:58.255
I love the way you're working
with the ear back in here.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.090
Add a little bit more
definition to it.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.058
From a distance,
you want it to be able

13:02.094 --> 13:03.460
to read a little bit, too.

13:03.495 --> 13:04.561
Thanks a lot.
Good luck.

13:04.596 --> 13:05.795
All right.

13:05.831 --> 13:07.998
- Bye, everybody.
- all: Bye.

13:08.033 --> 13:08.999
Thank you.

13:15.741 --> 13:19.509
Our character, The Raven,
has two flags on each shoulder,

13:19.545 --> 13:22.879
so I'm using a harness and
PVC pipe to create these flags

13:22.915 --> 13:24.881
to resemble chrome pipes,

13:24.917 --> 13:27.684
<i>and then add skulls
to the top of the flags.</i>

13:27.719 --> 13:30.153
Plus this is also a cool
opportunity to incorporate

13:30.188 --> 13:31.855
<i>pieces from our trunk
with the costume.</i>

13:31.890 --> 13:33.423
Hey, Logan.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.759
<i>I'm really stoked at how the
back piece is coming together.</i>

13:35.794 --> 13:37.327
It's gonna provide
a cool silhouette.

13:37.362 --> 13:39.529
- That's pretty fun.
- I like it.

13:39.565 --> 13:41.331
George, there's 13 minutes left.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.900
- Okay.
- Oh, beautiful.

13:48.307 --> 13:50.040
That's time, guys.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.086
Nice.

14:03.121 --> 14:04.688
Our silicone pieces
turned out beautifully.

14:04.723 --> 14:07.257
<i>I start sculpting the scar
on the face,</i>

14:07.292 --> 14:10.860
<i>and then Rachael and I both
sculpt the additional wounds.</i>

14:10.896 --> 14:13.730
<i>This has been the makeup
that I'm most excited about.</i>

14:13.765 --> 14:15.332
I feel really inspired,

14:15.367 --> 14:17.634
<i>so I'm looking forward
to our final product.</i>

14:17.669 --> 14:20.236
When you're done with that,
I'm gonna need his face.

14:20.272 --> 14:21.237
Copy.

14:26.311 --> 14:28.111
So the piece that I'm gonna be
making for our character

14:28.146 --> 14:30.847
is the full chest armor
and shoulders,

14:30.882 --> 14:33.216
<i>the backpack, and the overmask.</i>

14:33.251 --> 14:35.585
<i>So once the armor is done,</i>

14:35.621 --> 14:38.655
then I start to sculpt
the overmask.

14:38.690 --> 14:41.291
<i>I block it out
and place horns from the car</i>

14:41.326 --> 14:42.792
that kinda look like
a respirator.

14:42.828 --> 14:45.829
<i>And what I want to do is sculpt
this respirator in a style</i>

14:45.864 --> 14:47.797
that imitates kind of
a skull shape.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.400
<i>Then I vacuform it twice
because we need to have</i>

14:50.435 --> 14:52.602
two pieces between each other
so that the liquid

14:52.638 --> 14:54.504
has a place to sit inside of it.

14:54.539 --> 14:56.606
- That's both of them together?
- Yep.

14:56.642 --> 14:58.041
Sweet.

14:58.076 --> 14:59.643
Is the points coming out
better now?

14:59.678 --> 15:02.112
- Yeah, much better. Look.
- Oh, yeah.

15:02.147 --> 15:05.215
Our character is gonna have
saw blades and bolts

15:05.250 --> 15:07.217
<i>accenting different parts
of her costume</i>

15:07.252 --> 15:08.785
<i>and her metal Mohawk.</i>

15:08.820 --> 15:11.755
<i>And if you just take a metal
saw blade and a metal bolt,</i>

15:11.790 --> 15:13.490
<i>they're gonna weigh a ton.</i>

15:13.525 --> 15:15.925
<i>But we can make a mold
of those parts,</i>

15:15.961 --> 15:18.261
<i>and then cast
a lightweight plastic,</i>

15:18.296 --> 15:20.630
<i>so we have that exact bolt
and blade,</i>

15:20.666 --> 15:23.533
but in a material that is light,
safe,

15:23.568 --> 15:24.934
and it's a lot easier
to work with.

15:24.970 --> 15:27.203
Can you imagine getting sliced
across the face with this?

15:28.840 --> 15:32.108
<i>This challenge is one
of my favorites of all time.</i>

15:32.144 --> 15:33.743
And me a Cig are ready for war.

15:33.779 --> 15:35.679
<i>We've got our battle paint on,</i>

15:35.714 --> 15:38.648
and nobody's gonna try
to take over our clan.

15:38.684 --> 15:41.084
I wouldn't mess with her.

15:43.388 --> 15:44.621
I think it's ready.

15:44.656 --> 15:46.156
I'm happy with
the face sculpture,

15:46.191 --> 15:49.426
<i>and the ash mark sculptures
are ready for mold as well,</i>

15:49.461 --> 15:50.994
so we can focus
on the fabrication,

15:51.029 --> 15:52.962
which this challenge relies
very heavily on.

15:52.998 --> 15:55.765
<i>Adam comes up with this idea
for some scythe-shaped</i>

15:55.801 --> 15:58.301
<i>or crescent-shaped swords
for our character.</i>

15:58.336 --> 16:00.870
<i>Then I think being a samurai
character, a sword makes sense.</i>

16:00.906 --> 16:04.007
It's just the shape of the sword
I'm not entirely sure

16:04.042 --> 16:05.475
<i>would be best on a motorcycle.</i>

16:05.510 --> 16:09.245
<i>But Adam is a fabricating
whirlwind right now,</i>

16:09.281 --> 16:13.049
so we'll see.

16:16.755 --> 16:18.822
Throw on a couple of extra,
like, really big scars

16:18.857 --> 16:21.291
just to play around with.

16:21.326 --> 16:23.560
Okay.
Never mind, then.

16:23.595 --> 16:25.462
<i>While Keaghlan's working
on the face sculpture,</i>

16:25.497 --> 16:26.963
I have to build
this mechanical arm.

16:26.998 --> 16:29.833
<i>My idea is that the wiring
can be hooked into</i>

16:29.868 --> 16:32.035
what's left of her real arm.

16:32.070 --> 16:35.338
And that would be how she
controls the mechanical arm.

16:35.373 --> 16:37.640
<i>And then I figure it would
be run on hydraulics,</i>

16:37.676 --> 16:40.243
<i>so I set up the gauge
with some pumps,</i>

16:40.278 --> 16:43.847
so that would be how the arm
extends and contracts.

16:46.818 --> 16:49.586
I just wanted to see how they
would read from a distance.

16:49.621 --> 16:52.522
As opposed to going with a
traditional long samurai sword,

16:52.557 --> 16:54.124
I want to go
with two short swords

16:54.159 --> 16:56.126
<i>that echo the wheels
of the motorcycle.</i>

16:56.161 --> 16:57.827
<i>When she holds them out,
it'll actually take</i>

16:57.863 --> 17:00.563
<i>the silhouette and send
the energy down and out,</i>

17:00.599 --> 17:03.066
<i>making for a stronger presence
on stage.</i>

17:03.101 --> 17:04.434
Just needs something.

17:04.469 --> 17:05.835
They're just a little
fake looking.

17:05.871 --> 17:07.904
But Logan's concerned
with the way they look.

17:07.939 --> 17:10.173
Oh, fuck.
The board already broke.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.508
What's that?

17:11.542 --> 17:13.076
And, ultimately,
breaks one of them.

17:13.111 --> 17:16.212
Collapsed on itself,
so it broke.

17:16.248 --> 17:17.946
Oh, shit.

17:17.983 --> 17:20.349
It's frustrating.
To have essentially wasted time

17:20.385 --> 17:21.885
<i>is not productive.</i>

17:21.920 --> 17:26.522
I'm just doing everything I can
not to just, like, lose it.

17:32.374 --> 17:34.842
Collapsed on itself,
so it broke.

17:34.877 --> 17:36.277
Oh, shit.

17:36.312 --> 17:38.612
I just spent some time
fabricating these swords,

17:38.648 --> 17:39.813
<i>and Logan breaks one.</i>

17:39.849 --> 17:41.949
<i>So I decided to go out
and just cool off,</i>

17:41.984 --> 17:44.585
regroup,
and then just step back in.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.987
<i>In this environment, we only
have so much time to do stuff.</i>

17:47.023 --> 17:49.189
<i>So it's frustrating
having to make them again,</i>

17:49.225 --> 17:52.359
but the swords are really
important to the character,

17:52.395 --> 17:54.762
<i>so I have to figure out
how to make them work.</i>

18:01.137 --> 18:02.770
Looks like in "Mrs. Doubtfire"
when his face

18:02.805 --> 18:04.171
- falls out the window.
- Yeah.

18:04.206 --> 18:06.040
Since we've got
our silicone facepiece,

18:06.075 --> 18:07.474
<i>I want to work on the cowl,</i>

18:07.510 --> 18:08.909
<i>so rather than sculpting
and molding,</i>

18:08.945 --> 18:10.244
<i>I'm gonna fabricate it.</i>

18:10.279 --> 18:13.113
<i>And we've got this spandex
head sock</i>

18:13.149 --> 18:15.849
<i>that I'm stretching over
the life cast,</i>

18:15.885 --> 18:19.386
<i>and then I'm taking this hot
gelatin that's melted down,</i>

18:19.422 --> 18:21.355
<i>and I'm using a tongue depressor</i>

18:21.390 --> 18:23.290
<i>and just smearing it
all over that.</i>

18:23.326 --> 18:25.826
And as it's cooling,
and you move it around,

18:25.861 --> 18:28.862
it gets a texture that looks
just like burn scars,

18:28.898 --> 18:31.832
<i>and it's better than we would
have been able to sculpt,</i>

18:31.867 --> 18:34.001
and we did it
in a tenth of the time.

18:34.036 --> 18:37.638
Yeah, it looks great.
Sweet.

18:41.944 --> 18:43.410
Oh, my God, it looks so cool.

18:43.446 --> 18:46.480
I finish the face sculpt and
hand that off to Tyler to mold,

18:46.515 --> 18:50.584
and then I work on gluing
more feathers to the horns,

18:50.619 --> 18:52.453
<i>creating a very dramatic
silhouette.</i>

18:52.488 --> 18:55.122
<i>So I epoxy the horns
into the cowl,</i>

18:55.157 --> 18:58.459
<i>and then I finish adding
all the feathers.</i>

18:58.494 --> 19:02.096
And then I take a red wig,
and I cut out a Mohawk shape,

19:02.131 --> 19:04.064
<i>and I thin it out with a razor.</i>

19:04.100 --> 19:07.067
We have immunity,
but I still want a top look.

19:07.103 --> 19:08.869
- I still want to win.
- That's cool.

19:08.904 --> 19:10.371
I like that volume.
That's so cool.

19:10.406 --> 19:11.939
And then we'll put stuff in her.

19:11.974 --> 19:13.674
30 minutes, everybody.

19:21.317 --> 19:22.716
All right, guys, it's time.

19:25.921 --> 19:27.254
Everyone's got such cool stuff.

19:27.289 --> 19:30.391
- I know.
- What a borderline pissy day.

19:46.742 --> 19:48.509
How's your face?
Did our face come out?

19:51.580 --> 19:54.481
<i>It's Application Day,
and I am excited</i>

19:54.517 --> 19:56.784
'cause I think our silicone
came out really well.

19:56.819 --> 19:58.419
Oh, these turned out great.

19:58.454 --> 20:00.421
Did you feel the face yet?

20:00.456 --> 20:02.389
This one's thick.

20:02.425 --> 20:05.426
Except for the facepiece.
It is really thick.

20:05.461 --> 20:07.261
Do think it's something
that we could do by hand

20:07.296 --> 20:09.029
better than using that piece?

20:09.065 --> 20:10.464
If we... yeah, we can.
Definitely.

20:10.499 --> 20:13.300
So we're hoping that we can

20:13.335 --> 20:16.103
<i>apply our tex directly
to the face in Last Looks.</i>

20:16.138 --> 20:17.471
<i>It is a little frustrating</i>

20:17.506 --> 20:19.640
because Gage and I
still have so much to do.

20:19.675 --> 20:20.841
How's your face?

20:20.876 --> 20:21.975
Our other pieces
are really good,

20:22.011 --> 20:24.211
but our face is pretty thick.

20:25.314 --> 20:28.549
- Hello, are you Crystal?
- How are you?

20:28.584 --> 20:30.184
- Matt, it's nice to meet you.
- I'm good, nice to meet you.

20:30.219 --> 20:31.285
All right, Tyler,
she's ready for her bolt cap.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.352
Okay.

20:32.388 --> 20:34.488
It's so important
to our character

20:34.523 --> 20:37.591
that this headpiece stays secure
on our model's head,

20:37.626 --> 20:40.394
<i>so we pin the cowl
to her wig cap</i>

20:40.429 --> 20:43.030
<i>in order to secure it
a little bit more.</i>

20:43.065 --> 20:45.532
Once the cowl is applied,
Tyler applies the face,

20:45.568 --> 20:48.102
<i>and then I help blend edges.</i>

20:48.137 --> 20:50.370
<i>And Tyler made
all of the piercings,</i>

20:50.406 --> 20:52.039
<i>so now we've got to spend
all this time</i>

20:52.074 --> 20:55.008
putting it on our model.

20:58.647 --> 21:00.514
- How nice is that?
- I like that.

21:00.549 --> 21:01.515
- You gonna keep it dark?
- Yeah.

21:01.550 --> 21:02.783
Okay, cool.

21:02.818 --> 21:04.751
I think me and Logan
are on a better page today,

21:04.787 --> 21:06.787
a bit more in tune,
understanding what each of us

21:06.822 --> 21:08.555
<i>expect from the character
and the makeup,</i>

21:08.591 --> 21:11.091
<i>so while Logan is applying
the makeup,</i>

21:11.127 --> 21:12.993
I finish the swords that our
character needs

21:13.028 --> 21:14.895
to have on stage.

21:14.930 --> 21:16.597
<i>I decide to reinforce the handle</i>

21:16.632 --> 21:20.300
<i>as well as use a motorcycle
wheel cover cut in half</i>

21:20.336 --> 21:21.602
as sheaths for each sword.

21:21.637 --> 21:25.072
<i>And it's looking pretty cool.</i>

21:31.147 --> 21:33.113
Move around a little
see you with the weight.

21:33.149 --> 21:34.815
It's good.
You totally glued it crooked.

21:34.850 --> 21:36.183
Oh, I did.

21:36.218 --> 21:38.085
Since we're focusing
on a really clean makeup,

21:38.120 --> 21:40.354
we need to get everything
applied and mostly painted

21:40.389 --> 21:41.555
<i>before Last Looks.</i>

21:41.590 --> 21:43.357
<i>George starts applying
the cowl and the face,</i>

21:43.392 --> 21:45.526
<i>and I start working
on the body pieces.</i>

21:45.561 --> 21:48.929
What's good for us is that
there's usually an abrupt stop

21:48.964 --> 21:50.964
<i>between the burn
and normal skin,</i>

21:51.000 --> 21:53.400
so our edges aren't
terribly important,

21:53.435 --> 21:55.802
but we still want to make sure
they're spot-on.

21:55.838 --> 21:57.404
<i>Everything is really
coming together,</i>

21:57.439 --> 22:01.108
and it's looking really cool.

22:05.848 --> 22:07.447
While working with
one of your guns,

22:07.483 --> 22:10.184
it backfired and blew off
half of your arm,

22:10.219 --> 22:12.653
so you just turned your arm
into a gun.

22:12.688 --> 22:14.421
I'm feeling really good
about this character,

22:14.456 --> 22:15.923
<i>but we have a lot to get done.</i>

22:15.958 --> 22:18.258
<i>Melissa has to finish
some of the fabrication</i>

22:18.294 --> 22:20.527
<i>of our costume
and machine gun arm,</i>

22:20.563 --> 22:23.163
and once I'm done
applying her facepiece,

22:23.199 --> 22:25.432
<i>I then need to apply
the transfers.</i>

22:25.467 --> 22:27.834
I want a good makeup
on that Reveal Stage.

22:27.870 --> 22:31.638
<i>I'm really excited to see
the whole makeup come together.</i>

22:35.211 --> 22:37.678
- I saw that, it looks awesome.
- Yeah, it looks crazy.

22:37.713 --> 22:39.079
Good job, dude.

22:39.114 --> 22:41.915
Ben goes in and starts getting
the burn makeup all put on

22:41.951 --> 22:43.750
while I continue
with fabrication.

22:43.786 --> 22:47.821
<i>I have to put the coolant in
the backpack and the overmask,</i>

22:47.856 --> 22:50.424
<i>but I'm having a hard time
with the overmask.</i>

22:50.459 --> 22:52.392
This thing is gonna be a
nightmare

22:52.428 --> 22:53.760
to get that liquid into.

22:53.796 --> 22:55.796
There's not enough room
between the masks

22:55.831 --> 22:57.030
<i>to get this liquid to work,</i>

22:57.066 --> 22:58.432
so I have to try something else.

22:58.467 --> 23:01.101
<i>So I take alcohol, paint,
and get it in there</i>

23:01.136 --> 23:03.503
<i>the best I can
because it's gonna dry</i>

23:03.539 --> 23:05.372
<i>and still kinda give you
the impression of it.</i>

23:05.407 --> 23:08.308
It's not perfect,
but you get the idea.

23:10.079 --> 23:11.345
15 minutes, guys!

23:18.587 --> 23:21.054
- It's time!
- All right.

23:21.090 --> 23:22.656
Gage and I still have
a lot of work to do.

23:22.691 --> 23:25.726
<i>We still have to dress
the entire face.</i>

23:25.761 --> 23:27.427
<i>I am worried
about the time it's gonna take,</i>

23:27.463 --> 23:30.564
so I'm really hoping we can
pull everything together

23:30.599 --> 23:32.766
in Last Looks.

23:39.971 --> 23:41.670
It's Last Looks,
and we have one hour

23:41.706 --> 23:43.038
to get all of our work done.

23:43.074 --> 23:45.808
<i>I start painting the arms
to match the face</i>

23:45.843 --> 23:48.978
<i>and Even is doing final touches
on the fabrication.</i>

23:49.013 --> 23:50.379
I think we did
a really great job on this one.

23:54.552 --> 23:56.485
<i>While Rachael's working
on the hair,</i>

23:56.520 --> 23:58.420
I'm applying stuff known
as fish skin.

23:58.456 --> 24:00.522
<i>It's a makeup material
that's thin like tissue paper,</i>

24:00.558 --> 24:02.558
which will give the skin
the weathered look.

24:02.593 --> 24:05.661
<i>And then I put the scar on the
side of his face using Artex.</i>

24:05.696 --> 24:07.396
It's just a mad dash.

24:11.102 --> 24:13.969
I want to make sure that
the face pops the way it should,

24:14.005 --> 24:16.505
<i>so I had to take her goggles
and apply them over her face</i>

24:16.540 --> 24:18.440
and spattered dirt on there
to make it look like

24:18.476 --> 24:20.910
she's been wearing these goggles
for a long period of time.

24:20.945 --> 24:21.944
<i>And it looks pretty cool.</i>

24:21.979 --> 24:23.245
Sweet.

24:25.716 --> 24:28.217
George and I have to do
all the fine brush detail work.

24:28.252 --> 24:30.452
<i>So I start using
the Kryolan cream palette</i>

24:30.488 --> 24:32.488
<i>to go in the details
and punch up</i>

24:32.523 --> 24:34.556
<i>some of the scars
and the shadowing.</i>

24:34.592 --> 24:36.792
<i>I'm just so excited
about this character.</i>

24:36.827 --> 24:38.327
It's really coming together.

24:38.362 --> 24:39.428
15 minutes.

24:48.973 --> 24:52.241
That's time, everyone.

24:52.276 --> 24:55.110
Time is up and I see
that Logan has dusted her face.

24:55.146 --> 24:56.912
<i>And she looks like</i>

24:56.948 --> 24:58.647
<i>a "Mary Poppins"
chimney sweep now.</i>

24:58.683 --> 25:01.016
The tattoo's gone,
the face is covered.

25:01.052 --> 25:03.052
<i>I'm worried.</i>

25:12.930 --> 25:15.631
Welcome to
the Face Off Reveal Stage.

25:15.666 --> 25:19.134
Tonight, unfortunately,
two of you will be eliminated.

25:19.170 --> 25:21.704
First, lets say hello
to our amazing judges.

25:21.739 --> 25:23.739
Owner of Alchemy Studios
Glenn Hetrick.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.574
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

25:25.609 --> 25:28.477
Oscar and Emmy Award-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

25:28.512 --> 25:30.612
- Evening, all.
- Hey, Ve.

25:30.648 --> 25:32.648
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

25:32.683 --> 25:35.584
- Hello.
- Hi, Neville.

25:35.619 --> 25:38.821
And as you can see,
we have a very special guest

25:38.856 --> 25:40.255
joining us tonight.

25:40.291 --> 25:43.425
He's an incredibly talented
writer, producer, and director,

25:43.461 --> 25:46.061
whose films include
the post-apocalyptic thrill ride

25:46.097 --> 25:50.032
<i>"Death Race" and the
"Resident Evil" franchise.</i>

25:50.067 --> 25:52.701
Please give a warm welcome
to Paul WS Anderson.

25:55.006 --> 25:57.039
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, nice to see you again.

25:57.074 --> 25:58.640
Thank you for joining us again.

25:58.676 --> 26:00.642
<i>Paul WS Anderson
directed "Resident Evil,"</i>

26:00.678 --> 26:02.044
<i>which is one
of my favorite movies.</i>

26:02.079 --> 26:03.912
It's exciting that he gets
to see my work

26:03.948 --> 26:05.314
and intimidating, too.

26:05.349 --> 26:06.949
Are you ready to see
some makeups tonight?

26:06.984 --> 26:07.950
- Absolutely.
- All right.

26:07.985 --> 26:09.284
Well, let's do this then.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.186
Your Spotlight Challenge
this week

26:11.222 --> 26:14.823
was to select a magnificent
post-apocalyptic vehicle

26:14.859 --> 26:16.592
and create its driver.

26:16.627 --> 26:19.928
And in an added twist,
we asked you to incorporate

26:19.964 --> 26:23.165
three unique car parts
into your character.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.767
So without further adieu,

26:24.802 --> 26:26.835
let's take a look
at your creations.

26:47.858 --> 26:50.592
<i>She's got attitude,
she's gross, she's scary.</i>

26:50.628 --> 26:51.794
I feel like George and I

26:51.829 --> 26:53.295
definitely brought
our vision to life.

27:13.517 --> 27:15.517
<i>I'm a little nervous
and also a little excited</i>

27:15.553 --> 27:16.952
<i>'cause I feel like Evan and I</i>

27:16.987 --> 27:20.689
put something pretty awesome
up on stage.

27:38.175 --> 27:40.742
<i>I love the character.
I love the silhouette.</i>

27:40.778 --> 27:42.111
<i>She fits the car.</i>

27:42.146 --> 27:44.613
I'm really happy
with the way it looks.

28:06.036 --> 28:07.870
<i>I feel pretty good
about our character.</i>

28:07.905 --> 28:09.371
<i>I think it looks really good,</i>

28:09.406 --> 28:13.041
but there are a few little
elements that I would change.

28:29.860 --> 28:31.193
<i>I don't know
if they'll understand</i>

28:31.228 --> 28:33.395
<i>what the chestpiece is,
but I'm hoping that</i>

28:33.430 --> 28:35.430
at least it reads that we put
a lot of thought

28:35.466 --> 28:36.532
into this character.

28:54.952 --> 28:57.019
<i>I feel like we nailed
the character,</i>

28:57.054 --> 29:00.155
<i>but this is All-Stars, and
every little detail matters,</i>

29:00.191 --> 29:01.557
<i>so I'm worried
about what the judges</i>

29:01.592 --> 29:04.593
will think
about the application.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.832
Okay, judges,
why don't you go ahead

29:10.868 --> 29:13.268
and take a look at
our post-apocalyptic drivers.

29:19.543 --> 29:21.977
This is really cool.
There's lots of little details

29:22.012 --> 29:24.079
like these bolts and stuff
to break this up,

29:24.114 --> 29:26.215
so it's not just
the expected single blade

29:26.250 --> 29:27.482
down the middle of the head.

29:27.518 --> 29:29.418
Yeah, it gives it a really
nice asymmetrical feel.

29:29.453 --> 29:30.752
Yeah, you're right.
It's a nice touch.

29:30.788 --> 29:32.588
And they all have little bit
of red which really

29:32.623 --> 29:33.922
is kinda nice.

29:36.994 --> 29:38.727
I love that they made this.

29:38.762 --> 29:41.663
This is a great challenge to do,
a mask with a reveal.

29:41.699 --> 29:43.665
But this looks a little
haphazard to me.

29:43.701 --> 29:45.434
Like silly putty
stretched over his face.

29:45.469 --> 29:47.703
Yeah.

29:47.738 --> 29:49.805
The whole thing feels
very Clive Barker to me.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.907
- Yeah.
- And I'm a huge fan of Clive's,

29:51.942 --> 29:54.076
but that doesn't seem to be
what the challenge was.

29:54.111 --> 29:55.644
I do like the body painting
though.

29:55.679 --> 29:59.014
I love all the dirt
and the graphic designs on her.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.282
That's really well done.

30:00.317 --> 30:01.717
She's a great looking character,

30:01.752 --> 30:04.319
just for a different challenge.

30:04.355 --> 30:08.457
You know this paint job
is so dreadful everywhere.

30:08.492 --> 30:10.759
I agree with you,
I don't think it's executed

30:10.794 --> 30:11.860
particularly well.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.428
And the paint job on the face
is a mess, too.

30:13.464 --> 30:14.963
Yeah.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
<i>I really don't know
what the judges are thinking.</i>

30:17.034 --> 30:19.968
<i>I just hope they appreciate
the overall character design,</i>

30:20.004 --> 30:21.770
but I'm feeling like
we're on bottom.

30:28.401 --> 30:30.102
I'm worried about
the muddiness of the makeup.

30:30.972 --> 30:31.570
Ooh, this is much cooler
up close.

30:31.672 --> 30:32.938
Much.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.707
<i>Hopefully the silhouette
and the final effect</i>

30:34.809 --> 30:35.941
will be enough to carry us on.

30:36.043 --> 30:40.412
I get it. Sort of repeating
this bird design.

30:40.514 --> 30:43.582
The wrinkles are so nebulous.
There's no form to it at all.

30:43.684 --> 30:46.352
Well, at least they've tried
to integrate it into the makeup

30:46.454 --> 30:47.820
rather than making it
a piece of costume.

30:47.922 --> 30:51.824
And I agree with you,
it's not terribly well done.

30:51.926 --> 30:53.192
It's a fun idea.

30:53.294 --> 30:55.294
It's strange, though,
the choice of color.

30:55.396 --> 30:57.663
Yeah, I'm real confused
about the coloration.

30:57.765 --> 31:00.699
I like the electrical stuff
going into the flesh.

31:00.801 --> 31:02.735
Yes.
Thank you.

31:06.974 --> 31:09.508
All right, the judges would
like to speak with all of you

31:09.610 --> 31:11.610
before making
their decisions, so,

31:11.712 --> 31:13.946
Ben and Evan, please step up.

31:19.887 --> 31:21.286
Tell me about
your wasteland warrior

31:21.389 --> 31:23.288
and how you integrated
your vehicle parts.

31:23.391 --> 31:26.659
This is our Disco Inferno
character.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.327
He got in a really bad car wreck

31:28.429 --> 31:29.762
and burned most of his body,

31:29.864 --> 31:32.798
so we incorporated
this air filter back here

31:32.900 --> 31:35.167
and turned it into
a backpack cooling system.

31:35.269 --> 31:38.303
The idea is that he's keeping
himself cool with coolant.

31:38.406 --> 31:41.206
Through this mask
and on most of his burns.

31:41.308 --> 31:44.343
Super cool stuff.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.813
You actually see clear masks
like that used on burn victims,

31:47.915 --> 31:49.715
so you guys did
a really great job

31:49.817 --> 31:51.583
in presenting
a very complete character.

31:51.686 --> 31:52.818
Both: Thank you.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.888
I like the idea of using
the green antifreeze

31:55.990 --> 31:57.656
as a color note.

31:57.758 --> 31:59.625
That feels really
authentically aged,

31:59.727 --> 32:02.094
- and it's pretty cool.
- Thank you.

32:02.196 --> 32:03.262
You've done tremendously well,

32:03.364 --> 32:07.132
but by creating both a mask
and burn makeup,

32:07.234 --> 32:09.435
you've given yourself
only 50% of time

32:09.537 --> 32:11.403
to do each item.

32:11.505 --> 32:15.274
I wish you'd concentrated
on one thing or the other.

32:15.376 --> 32:16.975
Ben and Evan, please head back.

32:17.078 --> 32:18.977
Thank you, guys.

32:23.884 --> 32:26.251
Logan and Adam, step up, please.

32:34.361 --> 32:37.296
Tell us about
your post-apocalyptic warrior.

32:37.398 --> 32:39.531
The wasteland people
refer to her as The Raven,

32:39.633 --> 32:42.468
so she's this traveling
samurai character.

32:42.570 --> 32:43.769
We took the fender
from our motorcycle

32:43.871 --> 32:46.538
and split it in half
for handle guards on the sword.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.840
- Okay.
- And then we also used

32:47.942 --> 32:50.242
additional parts to fabricate
the whole backpiece.

32:50.344 --> 32:55.013
The makeup itself,
is not really well-painted.

32:55.116 --> 32:56.515
It looks like you just took
an airbrush

32:56.617 --> 32:58.617
and blacked out
half of her face.

32:58.719 --> 33:00.753
And what are these etchings
on her arm?

33:00.855 --> 33:01.920
They're tally marks.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.355
She's keeping count
of something.

33:03.457 --> 33:05.023
Okay, you have
a missed opportunity there.

33:05.126 --> 33:06.792
You could have made
some of those things infected.

33:06.894 --> 33:08.427
You could have done all kinds
of cool stuff

33:08.529 --> 33:09.561
with those tally marks.

33:09.663 --> 33:11.497
And I like the tribal stuff
on the face,

33:11.599 --> 33:13.665
but you covered it up
with that black dust.

33:13.768 --> 33:14.933
Okay.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.902
Everything is big and bold
and striking,

33:17.004 --> 33:19.705
but the detail for me
in the makeup is lacking

33:19.807 --> 33:21.673
You know, what you would see
in a big close-up

33:21.776 --> 33:24.243
as opposed to a wide shot,
but terrific ideas.

33:24.345 --> 33:26.078
Both: Thank you.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.913
Logan and Adam,
if you'd please head back.

33:28.015 --> 33:29.915
Thank you.

33:35.256 --> 33:36.288
Emily and Tyler.

33:43.364 --> 33:45.430
Tell us about
your wasteland character

33:45.533 --> 33:47.266
and the car components
that you used.

33:47.368 --> 33:50.035
All right, so this is Sava,
the huntress, and at night,

33:50.137 --> 33:53.438
she takes revenge on the rebels
who destroyed her clan.

33:53.541 --> 33:57.009
We had several car parts,
including two grill pieces,

33:57.111 --> 34:00.012
pipe, and then this piece
here on her leg as a brace.

34:00.114 --> 34:03.348
I think it's a unique,
cool character.

34:03.450 --> 34:07.953
Taking this gradation of black
to red to cream

34:08.054 --> 34:09.721
is a gorgeous aesthetic choice.

34:09.824 --> 34:10.956
Both: Thank you.

34:11.058 --> 34:13.492
I have a huge issue

34:13.594 --> 34:15.527
with the fact that it is not
within the challenge,

34:15.629 --> 34:19.630
but it's triumphant in terms of
both color and form,

34:19.733 --> 34:22.234
so other than that one huge
conceptual error,

34:22.335 --> 34:24.670
- this is a smashing success.
- Thank you.

34:24.772 --> 34:27.639
I can tell you had your
fingers in that hair business

34:27.741 --> 34:29.341
up there 'cause it's just
too awesome.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.677
You always do the most
fantastic head pieces.

34:31.779 --> 34:34.913
- Really well put together, guys.
- Thank you.

34:35.014 --> 34:37.583
Emily and Tyler,
please step back, you two.

34:37.685 --> 34:39.585
Thanks for the help.

34:44.091 --> 34:45.858
Cig and George, you're up.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.699
Please tell us about
your road warrior character

34:54.802 --> 34:56.335
and also the car parts

34:56.437 --> 34:58.270
that you've had to incorporate
with her.

34:58.372 --> 35:02.241
She survived an explosion
and took that as, like,

35:02.343 --> 35:03.809
a divine sign,

35:03.911 --> 35:07.112
so she travels the wasteland
to purify it in flame,

35:07.214 --> 35:09.982
and she has people
that want to be purified by her.

35:10.084 --> 35:12.351
Well, I'd put myself forward
for purification.

35:12.453 --> 35:14.286
Me too.

35:14.388 --> 35:16.622
I thought this design was
terrific from the first moment

35:16.724 --> 35:18.357
I saw it on stage in silhouette,

35:18.459 --> 35:20.792
and I like the whole
asymmetrical look.

35:20.895 --> 35:22.394
I find that very attractive

35:22.496 --> 35:24.863
- and very post-apocalyptic.
- Thank you.

35:24.965 --> 35:26.899
On her left shoulder,
that's one of the pieces

35:27.001 --> 35:28.667
that you had to integrate,
is that correct?

35:28.769 --> 35:31.003
This was a radiator tank,
I believe.

35:31.105 --> 35:33.105
It feels like a functional piece

35:33.207 --> 35:34.773
that she could wear
around the wasteland.

35:34.875 --> 35:37.342
You really finally hit your pace
here with this challenge.

35:37.444 --> 35:39.211
- Great job, guys.
- Thank you.

35:39.313 --> 35:41.580
You did some really nice,
subtle paint with this.

35:41.682 --> 35:44.549
She has some emblems
and different things

35:44.652 --> 35:46.919
that are integrated
into her burn makeup,

35:47.021 --> 35:48.921
so kudos to your work
this week, guys.

35:49.023 --> 35:50.489
Both: Thank you.

35:50.591 --> 35:52.491
George and Cig,
you can head back.

35:52.593 --> 35:53.692
- Thanks so much, guys.
- Thanks, guys.

35:53.794 --> 35:57.162
Thanks, Crystal.
You rocked it.

35:57.264 --> 36:00.432
- Very nice job, you guys.
- Thank you.

36:00.534 --> 36:03.101
Melissa and Keaghlan,
please come to the center.

36:09.643 --> 36:11.376
Tell us about
your wasteland warrior.

36:11.478 --> 36:13.879
Our character
is Mangle the Dweller.

36:13.981 --> 36:15.647
She's a raider warlord.

36:15.749 --> 36:17.816
We integrated the hubcaps
by cutting them

36:17.918 --> 36:21.086
and then using them as armor,
and on her arm,

36:21.188 --> 36:24.289
we integrated the wiring
into her arm apparatus,

36:24.391 --> 36:26.024
and then the gauge as well.

36:26.126 --> 36:31.763
Her facial makeup could use
a lot more erosion.

36:31.865 --> 36:34.333
I would love to see you
go in with a spray bottle

36:34.435 --> 36:36.335
and get some streaks
coming off of it.

36:36.437 --> 36:37.903
Really weather it down,

36:38.005 --> 36:39.738
so it's little areas
where it's rubbed thin,

36:39.840 --> 36:43.108
and things like that
go a long way.

36:43.210 --> 36:45.043
I'm not real happy
with the way you painted it.

36:45.145 --> 36:46.812
It just looks like
you dusted over it

36:46.914 --> 36:48.914
with some airbrush blush
or something.

36:49.016 --> 36:51.550
It's just dull
and not life-like.

36:51.652 --> 36:53.218
It's a cool idea
what you're doing

36:53.320 --> 36:56.822
with the gold-tipped bone,
but it doesn't feel realistic.

36:56.924 --> 36:59.257
I looked at that and thought,
"Oh, that's so ridiculous."

36:59.360 --> 37:03.095
I would reconsider that bone
even being visible.

37:03.197 --> 37:05.497
Keaghlan and Melissa,
could you'd please head back.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.532
Thanks, Carissa.

37:11.972 --> 37:13.605
Rachael and Gage.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.713
Tell us about
your wasteland character

37:21.815 --> 37:23.849
and how you incorporated
your car parts.

37:23.951 --> 37:26.184
Our character
is Scry the Scavenger,

37:26.286 --> 37:29.221
and we incorporated
a smoke alarm, a switch,

37:29.323 --> 37:32.357
and headlight cover
that has helped protect

37:32.459 --> 37:33.658
that area of his chest.

37:33.761 --> 37:35.527
How effective do you think
this makeup is

37:35.629 --> 37:36.795
for this challenge?

37:36.897 --> 37:40.132
I think we were really excited
about the concept of it,

37:40.234 --> 37:42.334
but I don't think we're happy
with the makeup.

37:42.436 --> 37:45.537
Yeah, I'm not happy
with it either.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.806
You would have to make
the coloring on this chest

37:47.908 --> 37:50.475
a lot more realistic,
and I think it could have been

37:50.577 --> 37:53.445
a lot more successful had you
used it as an exterior part

37:53.547 --> 37:55.781
- or something that he wore.
- Okay.

37:55.883 --> 37:58.583
It's a bold idea,
but I see way too much on it.

37:58.685 --> 38:00.018
- Okay.
- If you leave more

38:00.120 --> 38:01.486
to my imagination,

38:01.588 --> 38:03.121
you'd have had more time
to concentrate

38:03.223 --> 38:06.224
- on a smaller area.
- That makes perfect sense.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.126
And also, the fish skin,

38:08.228 --> 38:10.062
I wish the edges
weren't quite so obvious.

38:10.164 --> 38:13.198
It's a cool idea, but a very
difficult idea to execute.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.499
Right.

38:14.601 --> 38:15.767
The problem is you took
your pieces

38:15.869 --> 38:17.169
and just stuck them
in the middle of the chest.

38:17.271 --> 38:19.738
If I had that grate,
I would have bent that thing up

38:19.840 --> 38:21.673
and banged it around
until you fit it over his head

38:21.775 --> 38:23.275
as a cage of some sort.

38:23.377 --> 38:25.177
I just think that you guys
lost your way a little bit.

38:25.279 --> 38:26.878
Right.

38:26.980 --> 38:28.847
Rachael and Gage,
if you'd please step down.

38:28.949 --> 38:30.849
Thank you, Matt.

38:34.555 --> 38:35.787
Thank you.

38:38.859 --> 38:41.860
Okay, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

38:41.962 --> 38:44.596
The winning team tonight is...

38:49.536 --> 38:51.403
George and Cig.

38:51.505 --> 38:54.306
Holy cow.

38:54.408 --> 38:56.675
You perfectly balanced
form and color

38:56.777 --> 38:59.311
combined with amazing asymmetry.

38:59.413 --> 39:00.712
You really pulled it out
tonight.

39:00.814 --> 39:02.214
- Impressive work, fellas.
- Thanks.

39:02.316 --> 39:03.281
Thank you, guys, so much.

39:03.383 --> 39:04.483
- We got a win.
- We really got a win?

39:04.585 --> 39:05.984
- Got a win.
- Yeah.

39:06.086 --> 39:08.620
<i>To have such a love
for the genre</i>

39:08.722 --> 39:11.289
and to get a win on that,
it feels really good.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.591
Samesies.

39:12.693 --> 39:15.560
Cig and George,
excellent work this week.

39:15.662 --> 39:22.067
You, Emily and Tyler,
Ben and Evan are all safe.

39:22.169 --> 39:24.736
For the rest of you,
we're obviously doing things

39:24.838 --> 39:27.839
a little bit differently
tonight.

39:27.941 --> 39:30.976
In keeping with Hyundai's
slogan, "We make things better,"

39:31.078 --> 39:33.512
the judges are giving you
the opportunity

39:33.614 --> 39:36.148
to make your makeups better
based on the feedback

39:36.250 --> 39:37.749
that you received
from them earlier.

39:37.851 --> 39:39.417
- Okay.
- That's right.

39:39.520 --> 39:44.689
You guys are getting
another hour of Last Looks.

39:44.791 --> 39:46.858
Holy shit.
I didn't see this coming.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.895
<i>But now we have one hour left
and somebody's going home.</i>

39:49.997 --> 39:52.931
We need to figure this out,
and we need to work fast.

39:58.232 --> 40:01.067
You guys are getting
another hour of Last Looks.

40:01.103 --> 40:02.535
Holy shit.

40:02.571 --> 40:04.304
All right,
let's get things under way.

40:04.339 --> 40:06.906
Models, take your seats
back in the makeup room.

40:10.479 --> 40:12.545
- You guys ready to do this?
- Yep.

40:12.581 --> 40:15.715
- Yep.
- All right, your time starts now.

40:22.958 --> 40:25.425
So we get into
our second Last Looks.

40:25.460 --> 40:27.894
<i>Rachael and I are going to
take the key points</i>

40:27.929 --> 40:30.196
about what they didn't like
and we're going to change that.

40:30.232 --> 40:33.333
<i>So immediately I cut the cage
out of the chest.</i>

40:33.368 --> 40:35.235
Rachael is fixing the hair,

40:35.270 --> 40:37.804
<i>and I get to removing
the fish skin.</i>

40:37.839 --> 40:39.773
We don't have anything
to bandage

40:39.808 --> 40:41.241
our character's chest
and stomach

40:41.276 --> 40:42.609
and help hide what's going on,

40:42.644 --> 40:45.545
so Rachael has a scarf
on her neck that she takes off

40:45.580 --> 40:48.415
and we start cutting it up
and wrapping it around

40:48.450 --> 40:50.850
<i>and trying to really cover
what's there,</i>

40:50.886 --> 40:52.685
<i>but leave certain elements open.</i>

40:52.721 --> 40:54.521
I mean, I hope it's enough.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.159
<i>I'm pulling off
the makeup on the face.</i>

40:59.194 --> 41:01.060
<i>The judges' notes were that
Logan and I</i>

41:01.096 --> 41:03.596
obscured our makeup
and didn't paint it in a way

41:03.632 --> 41:05.031
that complimented the sculpt.

41:05.066 --> 41:08.902
And the whole thing was muddied
with dirt and overspray,

41:08.937 --> 41:11.938
<i>so Logan removes the dust that
he sprayed on our model's face.</i>

41:11.973 --> 41:15.375
<i>Then I go back in and start
adding more tribalistic tattoos</i>

41:15.410 --> 41:16.543
<i>going from her face,</i>

41:16.578 --> 41:18.044
<i>down her neck, and onto her arm.</i>

41:18.079 --> 41:19.913
- Logan, do we like this?
- Yeah.

41:19.948 --> 41:23.416
<i>We're also repainting the
eyepiece and the scarification.</i>

41:23.452 --> 41:25.118
Even though we're exhausted,
I want to put something

41:25.153 --> 41:26.386
out on stage that I'm proud of.

41:29.291 --> 41:30.924
That looks great.

41:30.959 --> 41:32.559
We have had a few bottom looks,

41:32.594 --> 41:34.060
<i>so I'm definitely nervous,</i>

41:34.095 --> 41:36.729
so I'm gonna make sure that
we do whatever we can to stay.

41:36.765 --> 41:38.765
<i>A couple of the critiques
Melissa and I got</i>

41:38.800 --> 41:42.101
were they didn't like the bone
protruding from the arm,

41:42.137 --> 41:43.870
so immediately I pull it
right out.

41:43.905 --> 41:46.306
<i>A lot of it's about making her
feel more weathered,</i>

41:46.341 --> 41:49.008
<i>so I go in and dirty up
the war paint.</i>

41:49.044 --> 41:50.810
<i>We add some tattooing.</i>

41:50.846 --> 41:52.912
<i>We make her hair
look even dirtier.</i>

41:52.948 --> 41:55.181
<i>We're trying to make her
feel like she's even more</i>

41:55.217 --> 41:56.883
of that post-apocalyptic
babe.

41:56.918 --> 41:58.718
<i>It's really important
that I present something</i>

41:58.753 --> 42:00.286
<i>that the judges are going to be
really happy with.</i>

42:09.631 --> 42:11.898
All right, guys, that's it.
Time's up.

42:14.369 --> 42:18.638
- All right.
- Hey, good job.

42:18.673 --> 42:20.406
<i>It's the end
of second Last Looks,</i>

42:20.442 --> 42:24.777
and I'm hoping that we have
done enough

42:24.813 --> 42:28.481
to stay in this competition,
but I'm nervous now.

42:28.517 --> 42:30.683
We did what we could.

42:30.719 --> 42:32.585
This is definitely
out of our hands now,
