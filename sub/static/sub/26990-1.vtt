00:26.068 --> 00:27.586
- Police
say they are becoming

00:27.586 --> 00:29.689
increasing concerned for
the safety of a vulnerable

00:29.689 --> 00:30.965
missing woman from Latnum.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.931
- Three fire
engines, police officers

00:32.931 --> 00:35.310
and even a water rescue team
were called out to look.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.724
- Top story
today, police and fire crews

00:37.724 --> 00:39.344
were called out to search
for a missing person

00:39.344 --> 00:41.793
that in one report
wore a pair of trainers

00:41.793 --> 00:43.620
and a backpack
near Latnum graves.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.241
- Police
are still searching

00:45.241 --> 00:47.965
for a student who sparked
a missing person's inquiry

00:47.965 --> 00:51.896
when she failed to turn up at
her parents on Christmas day.

00:51.896 --> 00:55.034
Joan Brice's worried
mother booked her missing

00:55.034 --> 00:57.103
when she did not arrive
at her family home

00:57.103 --> 00:58.620
on December the 23rd.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.931
- Detective
inspector Allen

00:59.931 --> 01:02.000
from the Glasgow area
said, "We're currently

01:02.000 --> 01:04.655
"liaising with the local
community in attempt

01:04.655 --> 01:06.620
"to locate the missing
youth, but anyone who

01:06.620 --> 01:09.724
"hasn't seen Stephanie
or knows her whereabouts

01:09.724 --> 01:11.344
"to call us as
soon as possible."

01:59.827 --> 02:02.586
- Did you know her,
the missing woman?

02:03.793 --> 02:06.793
- Yes, not very well,
but I'm doing my part.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.620
- Good, there's that many
people going missing these days,

02:12.620 --> 02:14.586
and no one seems to
really give a shit.

02:15.689 --> 02:16.862
- Humanity's in a rush.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.206
Nobody has any time for
anyone except themselves.

02:22.206 --> 02:24.172
- Well I hope she shows up.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.655
- Good morning, I'm Jacob.

03:00.655 --> 03:02.172
I'm a friend of Sams.

03:02.172 --> 03:03.413
- Lisa.

03:03.413 --> 03:04.482
- Coffee?

03:04.482 --> 03:05.655
- No thanks.

03:05.655 --> 03:06.827
I've gotta go.

03:17.103 --> 03:19.172
- Ta-da.

03:20.586 --> 03:23.931
- Breakfast, the most
important meal of the day.

03:23.931 --> 03:25.620
- It's not just any breakfast.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.000
This is a cowboy breakfast.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.103
I wolf down one of
these every single day.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.827
- Too bad I've already eaten.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.965
- Aye well you need to bus soon.

03:36.965 --> 03:38.241
I've got company comin' over.

03:38.241 --> 03:40.000
- Didn't your
company just leave?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.620
- What you think she's company?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.965
Wait till you see what I've
got coming around later.

03:45.965 --> 03:47.620
- Maybe you ought
to settle down.

03:49.758 --> 03:51.103
- Fuck.

03:51.103 --> 03:53.103
Fuck, that's her.

03:53.103 --> 03:55.758
You sure you don't want
it in a wee doggie bag?

03:55.758 --> 03:58.896
- No, maybe your
guest'll want it.

03:58.896 --> 03:59.862
- Come here.

04:01.344 --> 04:05.551
With a bit of luck, she'll be
feasting on something else.

04:06.827 --> 04:08.413
- Charmin'.

04:08.413 --> 04:09.689
I'll use the back door.

04:12.379 --> 04:15.862
- We're all here because
we have a problem,

04:15.862 --> 04:18.517
and we need to solve our
problem before it drains

04:18.517 --> 04:20.274
the life out of us.

04:20.274 --> 04:23.068
You can call it what
you want, an addiction,

04:24.206 --> 04:26.448
a fixation, a demon.

04:28.206 --> 04:31.896
But what it is is
an enslavement, one

04:31.896 --> 04:34.448
of craving and compulsion.

04:35.931 --> 04:40.172
And if you let it, it'll drag
you even deeper into despair.

04:41.689 --> 04:42.724
Let's open up to you.

04:44.827 --> 04:45.724
Scott please.

04:48.862 --> 04:51.103
- My name's Scott,
and I'm addict.

04:52.310 --> 04:54.586
I haven't had a drink
for about five months.

04:56.965 --> 05:00.793
Who am I tryin' to
kid, about five months?

05:00.793 --> 05:03.000
It's been four
months and 26 days.

05:04.206 --> 05:07.793
I know this because
like everyone else here

05:07.793 --> 05:09.896
I'll never forget my last drop.

05:09.896 --> 05:13.103
And thanks to the
people in this very room

05:15.310 --> 05:18.758
and the support of my loving
wife, I'm gonna stay clean.

05:18.758 --> 05:19.586
Thanks.

05:22.034 --> 05:23.344
- Jacob.

05:28.103 --> 05:30.655
- My name's Jacob,
and I'm an addict.

05:34.103 --> 05:35.827
That's all I have to say.

05:37.344 --> 05:39.275
- You've been coming
here awhile now,

05:39.275 --> 05:40.931
maybe give it some push.

05:40.931 --> 05:41.758
- Some push?

05:41.758 --> 05:42.586
- Just a wee bit.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.413
I'm your sponsor.

05:44.413 --> 05:45.482
You need to trust me.

05:53.172 --> 05:56.206
- My name is Jacob,
and I'm an addict.

05:59.068 --> 06:02.379
I know that when I let it
take over I become powerless.

06:04.413 --> 06:07.068
And like our great speaker
said, we have a problem.

06:09.517 --> 06:13.000
But that problem binds
us, brings us together.

06:16.344 --> 06:20.000
That problem gives
us a place to tell

06:20.000 --> 06:21.724
the tales that
make us who we are.

06:30.793 --> 06:31.620
- Not bad.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.310
- Thank you Russell.

06:35.689 --> 06:38.241
- My name is Rodger,
and I'm an alcoholic.

06:38.241 --> 06:40.413
- Do you mind if I ask
you a couple questions?

06:41.275 --> 06:42.103
- Not at all.

06:43.310 --> 06:45.344
- When was the last time
you saw healthy Jackie.

06:48.310 --> 06:49.413
- At the last meeting.

06:49.413 --> 06:50.689
- Thank you.

06:50.689 --> 06:52.000
- The night before
she went missing.

06:53.137 --> 06:54.034
- That's what Raymond said.

06:54.034 --> 06:55.965
- Hi my name's Frank.

06:55.965 --> 06:57.068
I'm an alcoholic.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.275
- It just doesn't make sense.

06:58.275 --> 07:01.586
She wouldn't just up
and disappear like that.

07:01.586 --> 07:02.758
- Russell, do you mind
if I say something

07:02.758 --> 07:04.758
without you taking offense?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.586
- Called me a drunk,
and said I needed help.

07:08.758 --> 07:10.862
- You didn't really
know Jackie that well.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.344
She'd only been coming
here a couple of months,

07:14.344 --> 07:17.448
and the last time she was
seen she was in a pub.

07:17.448 --> 07:18.275
What does that tell you?

07:18.275 --> 07:19.413
- It tells me nothing.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.724
Lots of alcoholics
go in pubs and clubs,

07:22.724 --> 07:24.965
it doesn't mean
they're drinking.

07:24.965 --> 07:27.551
You run that bar
for Christ's sake.

07:27.551 --> 07:29.034
- But I'm going to
prove 'em wrong.

07:29.034 --> 07:30.758
- Russell you're not
a policeman anymore.

07:30.758 --> 07:32.034
This isn't your case.

07:33.413 --> 07:36.827
All we can do is hand out
fliers and help with the search.

07:36.827 --> 07:37.862
- Ridiculous.

07:39.172 --> 07:40.758
Somebody must know something.

07:43.896 --> 07:48.482
- Russell, you
became an alcoholic

07:48.482 --> 07:49.517
because of your job.

07:49.517 --> 07:50.344
- So?

07:53.103 --> 07:55.310
- Forgive me for only
thinking about myself,

07:56.517 --> 07:59.344
but I don't want my
sponsor, my support

07:59.344 --> 08:03.620
to be delving into bad
habits and old lifestyles.

08:05.655 --> 08:07.206
It could be bad for both of us.

08:10.241 --> 08:12.206
- A search has been
launched for a woman

08:12.206 --> 08:14.137
who's been reported
missing from her home

08:14.137 --> 08:15.896
on the South side of Glasgow.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.724
32 year old Jacqueline
Crawford was last seen

08:18.724 --> 08:21.413
outside Murray's
Bar on Shuttle Lane

08:21.413 --> 08:24.586
at around two p.m. on
Tuesday the third of January.

08:24.586 --> 08:26.413
Miss Crawford's colleagues
raised the alarm--

08:26.413 --> 08:27.620
- Tell me something.

08:27.620 --> 08:28.586
- When
she failed to turn up

08:28.586 --> 08:29.793
at work the following day.

08:29.793 --> 08:32.068
- What kind of a
man does not drink,

08:32.068 --> 08:33.136
works in a pub, huh?

08:33.136 --> 08:34.344
- The family who live

08:34.344 --> 08:36.000
on the same street
as Jacqueline.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.688
- Who says I don't drink?

08:37.688 --> 08:39.655
- Don't talk pish.

08:39.655 --> 08:42.000
I've seen you at
those AA meetings.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.482
- Funny, I've not
seen you there.

08:45.482 --> 08:48.241
- Aye, well I've seen
you leaving them.

08:49.655 --> 08:50.931
- Just because I
attend those meetings

08:50.931 --> 08:53.000
doesn't mean I don't drink.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.931
Just means I don't like drinking
problem unlike yourself.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.793
- Oh, touche barman.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.482
- Her friend
Antony spoke about the search.

09:03.482 --> 09:04.931
- Paul, Tuesday?

09:06.620 --> 09:07.620
- On you go?

09:09.275 --> 09:13.137
- Warn somebody, anybody,
we're just all worried.

09:13.137 --> 09:15.103
- Jacqueline Carwford
is described and being--

09:15.103 --> 09:19.034
- Oh and by the
way, I do not have

09:19.034 --> 09:20.655
a drinking problem.

09:20.655 --> 09:22.344
That's why you don't see
me at those daft meetings

09:22.344 --> 09:23.620
you go to, huh?

09:25.620 --> 09:28.448
- I guess you won't
want another then?

09:28.448 --> 09:30.413
- Don't be daft.

09:30.413 --> 09:31.413
Fill 'er up.

09:40.689 --> 09:43.034
- You look like a man
that could afford this.

09:46.275 --> 09:47.103
- Excuse me?

09:48.344 --> 09:49.931
- I'll make it worth your while.

09:55.586 --> 09:58.068
- Don't you mean you'll
make it worth my money?

09:58.068 --> 09:59.103
- Aye, that too.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.586
- Maybe some other time.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.172
Are you hungry?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.724
- Why are you helping me?

12:37.103 --> 12:39.413
- Helping others gives me peace.

12:58.655 --> 13:00.620
- Jacob, let me in.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.068
I need to talk to you.

13:02.068 --> 13:03.379
- Do you want me to leave?

13:04.379 --> 13:07.724
- Not at all.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.068
- Good evening, Russell.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.965
Please come in.

13:32.724 --> 13:36.000
- Strange company to be
keeping this time of night.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.862
She's a mess.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.068
- You don't exactly
look great yourself.

13:41.413 --> 13:42.931
- Do you recognize this woman?

13:45.172 --> 13:46.448
Her name's Debra Allen.

13:48.310 --> 13:50.000
She went missing
three years ago.

13:51.172 --> 13:53.034
This was the last
case I was working

13:53.034 --> 13:55.275
when things went bad,
and I turned to drink.

13:55.275 --> 13:57.965
I lost my partner and my job.

13:57.965 --> 13:59.000
- Can't say that I do.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.275
Look Russell, why are
you telling me this?

14:05.034 --> 14:08.344
- I was thinking about what
you said the other day.

14:08.344 --> 14:10.413
And I don't think I
can be your sponsor.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.758
Look every time there's a
serious crime in this town,

14:14.758 --> 14:17.931
it brings me right back to this.

14:17.931 --> 14:20.000
And now that Jackie's
been AWOL, my mind's

14:23.068 --> 14:23.931
just not in it.

14:25.931 --> 14:26.758
- I understand.

14:27.965 --> 14:30.413
You know we all lose
it from time to time.

14:30.413 --> 14:31.655
- I don't know.

14:33.172 --> 14:36.344
Look Bill, just let me
step up to the plate,

14:36.344 --> 14:37.793
maybe he can be your sponsor.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.620
- Maybe.

14:44.689 --> 14:47.000
- Glad to see there's only
one glass of wine poured.

14:47.896 --> 14:50.172
That better be for your guest.

14:50.172 --> 14:51.758
- Of course.

15:09.655 --> 15:11.551
You need to leave, now!

15:27.206 --> 15:28.379
What's your name?

15:28.379 --> 15:29.655
- Teresa.

15:29.655 --> 15:31.482
- Okay Teresa, I'm
interested to see

15:31.482 --> 15:33.000
what you can do for me.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.827
- I can do a lot of things.

15:34.827 --> 15:38.000
- I bet you can, but
not here, at my house.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.655
Meet me around the corner
in five minutes, understood?

15:40.655 --> 15:41.896
- Okay.

15:51.896 --> 15:54.724
So what's first
bed, floor, couch?

15:56.103 --> 15:58.344
- How 'bout a drink?

16:06.068 --> 16:07.482
- Oh wine, fancy.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.551
- Nothing but the best.

18:18.068 --> 18:19.689
- Tough day?

18:19.689 --> 18:20.517
- Pour one.

18:34.551 --> 18:35.379
- Sam?

18:36.965 --> 18:40.655
Work or the miss, hmm?

18:46.551 --> 18:48.034
- Family.

18:48.034 --> 18:50.586
I've worked my balls off
all day just so I could see

18:50.586 --> 18:51.517
the kids tonight.

18:51.517 --> 18:52.482
Do you know what she's doing?

18:52.482 --> 18:54.931
She's taking them curling.

18:54.931 --> 18:56.482
Curling.

18:56.482 --> 18:59.206
What do you need that do you
know's out there curling?

18:59.206 --> 19:01.103
I swear she's doing
all she can to stop me

19:01.103 --> 19:02.137
seeing those kids.

19:07.689 --> 19:08.931
- Surely if you want to
spend time with them,

19:08.931 --> 19:10.172
and she's taking
them out tonight,

19:10.172 --> 19:12.517
the wise thing would be
for you to buy a ticket.

19:18.379 --> 19:20.068
- You're a genius.

19:21.413 --> 19:24.000
- I can nip back and get
changed and make it in an hour.

19:24.000 --> 19:24.862
- Come on.

19:37.379 --> 19:40.965
- Tell me is it a curling
game or a curling match.

19:40.965 --> 19:42.379
Do you know?

19:42.379 --> 19:44.310
- Match I believe,
but don't quote me.

19:44.310 --> 19:47.689
- Stacy, Stacy, what's
the matter with you?

19:47.689 --> 19:49.103
You're not fun to be
around like last night.

19:49.103 --> 19:50.620
- Oh don't act like
the big man, Richard.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.827
It's not my fault you
couldn't get it up last night.

19:53.620 --> 19:54.448
- Oh, you!

19:57.103 --> 19:59.896
What do you think you're
doing hitting a woman, huh?

19:59.896 --> 20:01.275
- Fuck off, or I'll
do worse to you.

20:01.275 --> 20:03.000
- Aye, well come ahead then.

20:06.034 --> 20:07.206
Fucking hell!

20:07.206 --> 20:08.551
Fuck!

20:19.482 --> 20:21.241
- I'll see you again.

20:24.206 --> 20:25.724
- Fuck.

20:36.206 --> 20:37.275
Thanks for the backup.

20:38.448 --> 20:40.517
- I don't have the
stomach for violence.

20:40.517 --> 20:43.310
What could that have
possibly achieved?

20:43.310 --> 20:46.620
- Aye well, so where can
I get a curling ticket

20:46.620 --> 20:48.517
around here then eh?

20:49.827 --> 20:51.448
- Police have
made a brand new appeal

20:51.448 --> 20:54.068
for help in locating
Jacqueline Crawford

20:54.068 --> 20:55.655
who has been missing
for two weeks.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.103
Jacqueline, 32,
has not been seen

20:58.103 --> 21:00.344
since Tuesday the
third of January

21:00.344 --> 21:02.379
when she left the
bar on Shuttle Lane.

21:02.379 --> 21:04.586
The latest appeal came
when family and friends

21:04.586 --> 21:07.379
sent out search parties
and asked for support

21:07.379 --> 21:09.586
in finding their loved one.

21:09.586 --> 21:12.448
Jacqueline Crawford is
described as slim build,

21:12.448 --> 21:15.724
five foot six, and she's
tall with long brown hair.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.793
- It's been great seeing you.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.551
- Take
whatever you want.

22:08.551 --> 22:12.862
- Oh, no, no, no, it's not
your money we want, love.

22:14.413 --> 22:15.793
- If it was, we
wouldn't even be here

22:15.793 --> 22:17.344
with some sanky homeless bitch.

22:23.103 --> 22:24.965
- Oh mate, this is
none of your business,

22:24.965 --> 22:26.379
so piss off.

22:27.724 --> 22:29.620
I mean it I'll fuck you up.

22:29.620 --> 22:32.724
- You're welcome to try,
and you'll probably succeed,

22:34.137 --> 22:36.413
but one of you will end up
with this across your face.

22:36.413 --> 22:38.827
The question is who will it be.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.275
- Come on.

22:43.275 --> 22:45.206
It's not worth it.

22:45.206 --> 22:46.965
Come on, I've dealt with
this asshole before.

22:46.965 --> 22:48.275
Let's go.

22:57.000 --> 22:57.827
- Jacob?

23:03.586 --> 23:04.620
Jacob Cleek?

23:07.620 --> 23:08.724
It's me, Norma.

23:35.965 --> 23:36.931
- Feel better?

23:36.931 --> 23:41.000
- Yeah, thanks for the shower.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.965
I hope I'm not keeping
you from anything.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.793
- No.

23:48.827 --> 23:50.482
I usually have an art
thing on a Tuesday,

23:50.482 --> 23:52.931
but it's nothing.

23:57.655 --> 23:59.965
So how did you become--

23:59.965 --> 24:00.793
- Homeless?

24:02.241 --> 24:03.482
- Unsettled.

24:03.482 --> 24:07.137
- You know me, mom was
a drunk, loved the men.

24:07.137 --> 24:08.206
- As did you.

24:09.068 --> 24:09.931
- Ouch.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.689
And when I'm told to do
something, I do the opposite.

24:15.689 --> 24:18.689
So when she tried to
ground me at 16, I left

24:18.689 --> 24:19.689
and went to Ireland.

24:20.551 --> 24:21.965
- Why Ireland?

24:21.965 --> 24:22.793
- Why not?

24:23.896 --> 24:27.275
Anyway, a guy
become my boyfriend.

24:27.275 --> 24:29.172
Moved in with boyfriend.

24:29.172 --> 24:30.724
Boyfriend was a junkie.

24:30.724 --> 24:33.206
Junkie got jailed, now he's
left paying less than them,

24:33.206 --> 24:34.379
ended up here.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.206
- Where's your mom?

24:39.206 --> 24:41.620
- If I knew that, I
wouldn't be out in the cold.

24:42.793 --> 24:44.206
- Dad?

24:44.206 --> 24:45.034
- Which one?

24:48.206 --> 24:49.517
No, don't do that.

24:49.517 --> 24:50.344
- Do what?

24:50.344 --> 24:51.172
- That.

24:52.965 --> 24:56.862
Look I have been on the
street for four years.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.275
I don't need your pity.

24:58.275 --> 25:01.586
So as soon as my clothes
are dry, I'll get away,

25:01.586 --> 25:02.827
and you can get on
with your project.

25:02.827 --> 25:04.413
- I don't pity you.

25:06.448 --> 25:08.000
I've not known you
for the last 17 years,

25:08.000 --> 25:09.413
so I don't pity you at all.

25:11.517 --> 25:12.965
But what I do know
is the only reason

25:12.965 --> 25:14.689
I got through high school
was because of you.

25:16.275 --> 25:19.413
You helped me through
it, so I owe you.

25:19.413 --> 25:21.034
- You don't own me anything.
- Yes, I do.

25:22.931 --> 25:24.310
So you're welcome to
stay here until you get

25:24.310 --> 25:25.206
back on your feet.

25:26.379 --> 25:27.482
- You said yourself,
yo don't even know me.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.689
- And you don't know me.

25:30.310 --> 25:31.413
I think after high
school, we both know

25:31.413 --> 25:32.620
we can trust each other.

25:34.034 --> 25:37.655
All I ask is on a Tuesday
night I get it to myself

25:39.413 --> 25:43.000
to work on my project
as you put it.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.000
- Thanks.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.896
- You're welcome.

25:51.620 --> 25:55.689
- Oh, well, well, well, you
don't call, you don't write.

25:55.689 --> 25:58.034
- I was at your door last
Wednesday morning, remember

25:58.034 --> 26:00.586
before your special
guest arrived.

26:00.586 --> 26:03.379
- I'm talking about
the pub, man, the pub.

26:03.379 --> 26:05.310
I mean Paul's got some
big-titted darling

26:05.310 --> 26:07.000
go up behind the bar, his cousin

26:07.000 --> 26:08.206
or something like that.

26:08.206 --> 26:10.172
Not that I'm complaining
about the view.

26:10.172 --> 26:11.965
But she can't pull
a pint for shit.

26:13.068 --> 26:14.655
So what's the story, you quit?

26:14.655 --> 26:17.758
- No, I had a friend staying
with me the last few days.

26:17.758 --> 26:19.103
I'm just helping her out.

26:19.103 --> 26:23.000
- Ooh, her, it's a bird, is it?

26:23.931 --> 26:26.448
So when do I get
to meet her, eh?

26:26.448 --> 26:28.310
- Not anytime soon.

26:28.310 --> 26:29.793
Look I'll be back at
work tomorrow, okay?

26:29.793 --> 26:30.620
I'll speak to you then.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.034
- Aye, no bother.

26:32.034 --> 26:35.620
Oh listen, I'll be out tomorrow
during the day, all right?

26:35.620 --> 26:38.482
Going to try and see
the kids, so no surprise

26:38.482 --> 26:40.172
coffee visits, huh?

26:40.172 --> 26:41.000
- Okay.

26:42.931 --> 26:43.862
Good to know.

27:45.724 --> 27:47.172
- Lisa, come on.

27:47.172 --> 27:48.103
This is just stupid.

27:48.103 --> 27:49.172
What are you doing?

27:49.172 --> 27:50.172
- Bugger off.

27:50.172 --> 27:51.241
- Lisa, I said I'm sorry.

27:51.241 --> 27:52.310
Just come back.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.137
- Piss off, May.

27:54.137 --> 27:56.000
- Walk away
like you always do.

27:58.758 --> 28:00.310
Stupid Cow.

28:41.068 --> 28:42.724
- Who the fuck are you?
- It's Jacob.

28:42.724 --> 28:44.172
Sam's friend, we met
a couple weeks ago.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.310
Do you need any help?

28:46.310 --> 28:47.172
- No, I'm fine.

28:48.172 --> 28:49.862
- Are you here alone?

28:49.862 --> 28:52.724
- Aye, my mate's just
pissed off and left me.

28:52.724 --> 28:55.206
Said I'm a pain in the
arse when I'm drunk.

28:55.206 --> 28:56.758
They're the arse holes.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.517
I don't need some creep
like you chasing after me.

29:04.379 --> 29:07.275
I just want to go home.

29:56.448 --> 29:58.275
- Well I've been
sitting here all night.

30:00.827 --> 30:02.172
- And?

30:02.172 --> 30:04.068
- You still haven't
bought me a drink.

31:59.034 --> 32:02.000
- Well, well, well,
Jacob, I have to say

32:02.000 --> 32:03.448
it's good to have you back, pal.

32:03.448 --> 32:06.000
- I'm surprised Paul didn't
get you to cover for me.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.896
You are here often enough.

32:07.896 --> 32:09.965
- You couldn't afford to
lose me as a customer.

32:09.965 --> 32:11.793
This place would
go bust without me.

32:12.965 --> 32:13.793
- Jacob.

32:13.793 --> 32:14.620
- Norma?

32:14.620 --> 32:15.620
- Guess what.

32:15.620 --> 32:16.448
- What?

32:16.448 --> 32:18.172
- I have got a job.

32:18.172 --> 32:19.275
- Congratulations, Norma.

32:19.275 --> 32:20.793
Doing what?

32:20.793 --> 32:23.517
- Cleaner, mopping, brushing
out closets, stuff like that.

32:23.517 --> 32:24.310
- Cleaner?

32:24.310 --> 32:25.551
- Yeah.

32:25.551 --> 32:26.965
- You sure that's
what you want to do?

32:26.965 --> 32:29.413
- Well it's not as
if I can be fussy.

32:29.413 --> 32:30.620
And come on, you
haven't really settled

32:30.620 --> 32:31.758
and made it yourself,
mr. big shot.

32:31.758 --> 32:32.655
You work in a pub.

32:33.793 --> 32:35.000
- Well the hours
are flexible for me.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.413
- For your painting, I know.

32:37.862 --> 32:41.310
Well your million pound
model is right here.

32:46.034 --> 32:46.896
Hello again.

32:47.931 --> 32:48.724
- Again?

32:51.931 --> 32:54.379
- Aye, we've met.

32:54.379 --> 32:56.275
- We have.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.517
- And if I remember
correctly, you owe me

32:58.517 --> 33:00.655
a few alcoholic beverages.

33:00.655 --> 33:03.482
- Well at least I know where
my first wage is goin'.

33:06.896 --> 33:10.517
Look I've got to go
and do some paperwork,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.517
but as soon as I have for a
month's rent, I'll be going.

33:15.965 --> 33:17.206
- Norma, there's no rush.

33:19.000 --> 33:19.862
- Thank you.

33:25.827 --> 33:26.655
- Huh?

33:26.655 --> 33:27.896
- Sam.
- Huh?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.413
- Is very
expensive today

34:44.413 --> 34:47.413
costing $10,000 or $15,000
if your getting 15.

34:49.516 --> 34:53.241
You look at them now after it's
done, and nothing's changed.

34:57.655 --> 34:59.000
- How you feeling?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.275
- I'll be okay.

35:00.275 --> 35:01.827
I think I'm just coming
down with something.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.931
- Well it's Tuesday night,
so if you don't mind I--

35:06.862 --> 35:09.034
- I just lightened my load.

35:09.034 --> 35:10.793
I'm not going anywhere.

35:10.793 --> 35:13.448
- You're looking
at his bags under his eyes.

35:13.448 --> 35:14.827
And now he's just got black--

35:14.827 --> 35:17.206
- But I need to keep
going with my work.

35:17.206 --> 35:19.000
I've got deadlines to meet.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.137
- Jacob, I really can't move.

35:22.482 --> 35:24.482
The way I'm feeling
I'll probably just crash

35:24.482 --> 35:26.827
here in an hour,
and you can get on

35:26.827 --> 35:29.448
with your project in peace.

35:29.448 --> 35:32.620
- Very
embarrassing for you.

35:32.620 --> 35:34.620
- I mean can you no
do it another night?

35:36.689 --> 35:38.689
Unless of course,
you're kicking me out.

35:41.758 --> 35:42.655
- Of course not.

36:02.586 --> 36:05.241
I'll be back in a
few hours, okay?

36:05.241 --> 36:06.068
- Okay.

36:18.862 --> 36:21.758
- Lousy, so
he asked me was that stupid?

36:23.689 --> 36:25.310
- You're
fuckin' joking man.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.137
- I know.

36:26.137 --> 36:27.482
- I fuckin' had it.

36:27.482 --> 36:28.827
Check it out, man.

36:33.034 --> 36:34.344
- All right, sweetheart?

36:34.344 --> 36:35.172
- Fuck off.

36:35.172 --> 36:36.551
- Oh, a dirty mouth.

36:36.551 --> 36:37.482
I like that.

36:37.482 --> 36:38.724
Let me show you how to use it.

36:43.206 --> 36:44.724
Cow.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.034
- I'm sorry.

36:46.034 --> 36:47.551
Am I interrupting?

36:48.896 --> 36:52.068
- So what you
gonna do this time?

36:52.068 --> 36:53.000
- Hit call.

36:56.241 --> 36:58.103
Do you need walked home?

36:58.103 --> 36:58.965
- Please.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.758
- You all right?

37:15.758 --> 37:16.586
- I'm fine.

37:18.206 --> 37:19.862
- What's your name?

37:19.862 --> 37:21.379
- Agnes.

37:21.379 --> 37:22.586
Thanks for that.

37:22.586 --> 37:24.896
Those guys were
fucking arse holes.

37:24.896 --> 37:26.620
You don't need to walk me home.

37:26.620 --> 37:27.482
- I insist.

37:27.482 --> 37:28.689
- Don't worry about it.

37:28.689 --> 37:29.896
Honestly, it's
not even that far.

37:29.896 --> 37:30.724
- Shush.

37:32.827 --> 37:34.379
I'm sorry.

37:34.379 --> 37:36.793
It's not supposed
to be like this.

37:36.793 --> 37:40.827
I'm usually a lot
more elegant, shush,

37:40.827 --> 37:43.931
not like those putrid
animals back there.

37:46.206 --> 37:48.344
- Please, you don't
have to do this.

37:48.344 --> 37:51.896
- What do
you have going on down there?

37:51.896 --> 37:53.620
- You're right.

37:53.620 --> 37:56.137
You saved me from those pigs,

37:56.137 --> 37:58.724
but you don't have to do this.

37:58.724 --> 38:01.793
- You have no idea
what I have to do.

38:05.034 --> 38:07.724
- Look just go,
and we'll take this

38:07.724 --> 38:10.620
as a misunderstanding, okay?

38:10.620 --> 38:13.103
I won't go to the
police, I swear.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.034
- Fuck you.

38:47.655 --> 38:49.137
- Jacob, you okay?

38:50.379 --> 38:51.275
- I'm fine.

38:52.206 --> 38:53.137
- Jacob?

38:53.137 --> 38:55.206
- I said I'm fine!

39:29.793 --> 39:31.310
- God,
grant me the serenity

39:31.310 --> 39:35.000
to accept the things
I cannot change.

39:35.000 --> 39:35.827
Courage to change
the things I can

39:38.379 --> 39:41.000
and the wisdom to know
the difference, amen.

39:41.000 --> 39:41.862
- Amen.

39:43.206 --> 39:47.758
I feel like I have
a bug, a bug that's

39:49.206 --> 39:50.655
crawling under my skin.

39:52.517 --> 39:57.068
A bug that's living,
breathing, controlling me.

40:01.655 --> 40:02.758
I'm not scared of it.

40:04.379 --> 40:09.241
I actually, well I
actually quite enjoy it.

40:12.241 --> 40:13.068
I crave it.

40:15.068 --> 40:18.931
- I'm sorry, mate, but
you're talking shit, so stop.

40:22.827 --> 40:27.827
Bill Paten, I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

40:28.931 --> 40:30.344
- Don't.

40:30.344 --> 40:31.931
Just don't.

40:31.931 --> 40:34.344
There's a lot of
people here trying hard

40:34.344 --> 40:38.000
to stay off the drink,
and you, you're talking

40:38.000 --> 40:41.586
about craving it,
letting it control you.

40:41.586 --> 40:42.827
You're giving people
the wrong impression.

40:42.827 --> 40:47.551
- Right, okay, let's
take five minutes, hey?

40:59.068 --> 41:03.965
Look, I know you didn't
agree what Bill said,

41:03.965 --> 41:05.172
but he's right.

41:05.172 --> 41:06.724
What the hell was
that all about?

41:08.482 --> 41:10.000
- Who's that woman?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.620
- Forget the woman.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.000
When was the last
time you had a drink?

41:16.620 --> 41:18.034
- Last Tuesday.

41:19.000 --> 41:19.931
- Last Tuesday?

41:19.931 --> 41:21.379
- Uh hmm.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.896
- Are you trying to
take the piss outta me?

41:23.896 --> 41:25.551
And when'd you start again?

41:27.413 --> 41:28.482
- I never stopped.

41:30.896 --> 41:31.931
- You never stopped?

41:33.620 --> 41:36.517
You know Jacob, you've been
coming here a long time.

41:36.517 --> 41:37.793
So if this is just
some joke to wind me

41:37.793 --> 41:40.000
and the group up, you
better come clean now.

41:44.310 --> 41:47.206
- I have an addiction,
Russell, but I have

41:47.206 --> 41:48.206
it under control.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.724
- How often?

41:49.724 --> 41:54.689
- Once a week, but
like I said I have it

41:55.310 --> 41:56.103
under control.

41:58.172 --> 42:02.620
- Look drugs, sex,
drink, it doesn't matter

42:02.620 --> 42:04.310
what the addiction is.

42:04.310 --> 42:07.172
If you're addicted,
you're not in control,

42:07.172 --> 42:08.517
and that just leads
to catastrophe.

42:08.517 --> 42:09.344
You have to ditch it.

42:09.344 --> 42:10.413
Do you understand?

42:12.241 --> 42:13.068
- Yes.

42:14.517 --> 42:18.034
Now Russell please, the
woman, what's her story?

42:23.620 --> 42:25.103
- Name's Catherine Dolan Pool.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.034
She's been coming here
for a few months now.

42:30.448 --> 42:33.862
She lost a daughter last year,
but she'd been doing well.

42:36.931 --> 42:39.862
She got another one on
the way, her partner,

42:42.034 --> 42:43.103
well he's got cancer.

42:45.689 --> 42:47.896
He wants to end it all
to stop the suffering.

42:50.413 --> 42:51.620
She's having none of it.

42:53.068 --> 42:55.827
Why are you so
interested in her?

42:55.827 --> 42:59.551
- Support and hope, Russell,
isn't that why we're here?

43:05.137 --> 43:07.103
Any word on Jacqueline?

43:07.103 --> 43:07.965
- No, nothing.

43:10.896 --> 43:12.793
- Send her friends
and family my best.

43:41.724 --> 43:43.896
- Jacob, are you in there?

43:43.896 --> 43:45.344
- I'll be out in a sec.

43:45.344 --> 43:47.413
- I need to get in.

43:51.103 --> 43:54.344
I'm bursting, come
on open the door.

43:56.724 --> 43:59.689
- Norma, Norma, I
need you to leave.

44:01.103 --> 44:04.896
- What, piss
of and let me in.

44:06.275 --> 44:07.275
- I'm sorry.

44:10.241 --> 44:12.724
- Norma, I'm serious
I need you to go.

44:12.724 --> 44:14.103
- You all right?

44:21.862 --> 44:23.344
- I just need you to go.

44:23.344 --> 44:25.344
- No, not until I
know you're all right.

44:28.137 --> 44:30.344
- Is this to do with
your art project?

44:30.344 --> 44:32.344
Is it stressing you out?

44:48.172 --> 44:49.689
Tell me what's up.

44:54.620 --> 44:55.448
- Tango.

44:57.172 --> 44:58.000
- Tango?

44:59.793 --> 45:01.034
- That's right.

45:02.551 --> 45:03.379
Tango.

45:04.655 --> 45:05.689
- What's a tango?

45:06.827 --> 45:11.137
- You, you're the
definition of a tango.

45:12.965 --> 45:16.482
You take and borrow
from me, lift and hawk

45:16.482 --> 45:17.827
until there's nothing left.

45:20.275 --> 45:23.137
How long are you gonna
bleed me dry, hmm?

45:25.034 --> 45:26.689
I keep you here.

45:26.689 --> 45:27.965
I feed you.

45:27.965 --> 45:29.172
I give you money.

45:29.172 --> 45:32.586
You now make your own
money, and all I ask for

45:33.724 --> 45:35.103
is a bit of privacy
on a Tuesday.

45:35.103 --> 45:36.413
- I'm sorry.

45:36.413 --> 45:38.655
- But no, you keep coming back.

45:46.758 --> 45:48.034
I'm too ill to go out.

45:49.517 --> 45:51.068
I think I'm gonna be sick.

45:53.206 --> 45:54.689
I mean what's wrong
with you, hmm?

45:56.241 --> 45:59.206
Why can't you leave me alone?

46:03.275 --> 46:04.517
Are you curious about me?

46:05.965 --> 46:10.517
Does my self sufficient and
independent life attract you?

46:13.034 --> 46:14.655
Or is there something else?

46:16.965 --> 46:17.965
Is it sexual?

46:17.965 --> 46:22.793
- I have cancer!

46:22.793 --> 46:25.896
I have cancer, and now
I know how you feel.

46:28.827 --> 46:32.551
But I want to thank you
for your hospitality,

46:33.862 --> 46:35.931
but I want no more of it.

47:48.965 --> 47:50.862
- All right Jacob,
what can I get you?

47:50.862 --> 47:53.689
- Hi Freddy, just to pick
up the steaks I ordered.

47:53.689 --> 47:54.517
- Oh right.

47:59.241 --> 48:01.034
Special occasion?

48:01.034 --> 48:04.758
- Just a guest who's dissatisfied
with my hospitality.

48:04.758 --> 48:05.586
- I'm sure these'll
go down a treat.

48:06.724 --> 48:07.620
- Thank you, Freddy.

48:07.620 --> 48:09.275
- No bother.

48:19.689 --> 48:21.310
- Was your steak cooked okay?

48:21.310 --> 48:23.379
- It was magic, thanks.

48:27.793 --> 48:28.655
It's lung cancer.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.758
I know you're dying to
ask, but you also know

48:34.758 --> 48:36.034
it's rude to ask.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
So instead you're just
sitting there making

48:40.000 --> 48:42.517
small talk while your
curiosity eats away at you.

48:45.413 --> 48:47.965
Anyway, I don't know
how long I've got,

48:49.137 --> 48:50.620
but don't worry I'm
not gonna drop dead

48:50.620 --> 48:52.655
on your bathroom floor
or anything like that.

48:56.517 --> 48:57.827
- I've told you before,
you're not for this neck

48:57.827 --> 48:59.137
of the woods.
- We go to the same school.

48:59.137 --> 49:01.655
We live in the same area.

49:01.655 --> 49:02.965
- And what?

49:02.965 --> 49:04.034
What are you gonna do?

49:04.931 --> 49:07.241
- You don't have to do this.

49:08.620 --> 49:10.310
You saved me from those
pigs, but you don't have

49:10.310 --> 49:11.724
to do this.

49:11.724 --> 49:13.689
I won't go to the
police, I swear.

49:29.034 --> 49:29.896
- Come on.

49:48.241 --> 49:50.310
Here, drink this.

49:59.413 --> 50:01.206
- It's not drugged, is it?

50:01.206 --> 50:04.827
- Do you think I'd
waste it on you?

50:04.827 --> 50:06.689
- Why'd you bring me here?

50:06.689 --> 50:11.310
- Firstly, here I can be your
mate, not just your customer.

50:12.724 --> 50:15.931
And secondly, it's the only
other bar where I can get tick.

50:19.931 --> 50:20.793
So what's up?

50:22.310 --> 50:24.379
You get your coffee
fix this morning, huh?

50:24.379 --> 50:25.689
- It's been a long week.

50:26.862 --> 50:27.793
- Long week?

50:29.068 --> 50:29.931
That's fine.

50:31.034 --> 50:33.379
I've got nothing better
to do all day today.

50:38.482 --> 50:39.275
- It's Norma.

50:40.827 --> 50:42.413
- What about her?

50:42.413 --> 50:43.379
You shagged her yet?

50:44.758 --> 50:48.758
Oh wait, is that it?

50:48.758 --> 50:50.448
She's not putting out, huh?

50:54.137 --> 50:56.206
All right, sorry right, go on.

51:01.068 --> 51:03.068
- I've got creative activity
every Tuesday night,

51:03.068 --> 51:05.344
and in order to get it done
I need to get my privacy.

51:05.344 --> 51:06.551
- What you can't work there?

51:06.551 --> 51:07.379
- Exactly.

51:09.103 --> 51:09.931
- I see.

51:11.344 --> 51:13.103
Well here's an idea for you.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.965
Why don't you make her
your creative activity

51:15.965 --> 51:17.310
and get her done, huh?

51:18.275 --> 51:19.103
I mean come on.

51:20.655 --> 51:21.931
Look as far as I can
see you're not making

51:21.931 --> 51:24.482
much money at this
art thing, right?

51:24.482 --> 51:26.517
So why don't you
take a break, man?

51:26.517 --> 51:28.793
Relax, chill out, huh.

51:28.793 --> 51:32.482
Spend some time getting tore
at that bird living with you.

51:32.482 --> 51:34.793
- What's your arrangements
on a Tuesday night?

51:34.793 --> 51:36.206
- No, no.

51:36.206 --> 51:38.758
No, no, no, no way,
man, no, no, no.

51:38.758 --> 51:39.689
You're not dumping me
with her, so you can

51:39.689 --> 51:40.517
go off and do you artist stuff.

51:40.517 --> 51:42.206
- Sam, I know you.

51:42.206 --> 51:44.724
Your Tuesday nights consist
of slumping up a bar,

51:44.724 --> 51:46.034
drowning yourself in
whiskey and waiting

51:46.034 --> 51:49.379
for some big breasted
stranger to walk in.

51:49.379 --> 51:50.862
And if that doesn't
happen, you'll phone up

51:50.862 --> 51:53.758
one of you many female
companions who you used

51:53.758 --> 51:56.206
and abused, and they thought
they were oh so special.

51:56.206 --> 51:58.000
- All right, all
right, fuck's sake.

52:00.793 --> 52:02.000
- Technically I'm helping you.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
- Right, how'd
you work that out?

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
- I'm cutting out the bit
where you drink alone.

52:09.931 --> 52:10.965
- Ah.

52:12.655 --> 52:15.034
It's been a long time
since I had a proper date.

52:16.586 --> 52:18.689
I don't get this.

52:18.689 --> 52:20.275
How come I take you out
for a drink to help you,

52:20.275 --> 52:22.000
and I end up taking
your bird out?

52:23.379 --> 52:27.379
- You are helping me more
than you'll ever know.

53:07.620 --> 53:10.758
Norma, I've got some good news.

53:10.758 --> 53:11.586
- What?

53:12.724 --> 53:14.103
- I've got you a
date Tuesday night.

53:14.103 --> 53:16.827
- Jacob, I don't want a date.

53:16.827 --> 53:19.344
Oh wait a minute, is this
because of the other night?

53:19.344 --> 53:21.172
- No, it's not.

53:21.172 --> 53:23.103
I just think you and Sam
would get on quite well.

53:23.103 --> 53:24.620
- Sam?

53:24.620 --> 53:28.310
The drunk in the bar that's
who you're setting me up with?

53:28.310 --> 53:30.724
- All right, he does
drink a lot, but let's

53:30.724 --> 53:33.413
be honest you're gonna end
up drinking wherever you go.

53:33.413 --> 53:37.206
- Fine I'll go, but I'm
getting hammered before it.

53:38.344 --> 53:40.413
- I wouldn't expect
anything less.

53:40.413 --> 53:43.103
And you never know, you
might even enjoy yourself.

53:44.827 --> 53:45.931
- Aye, right.

54:00.413 --> 54:01.379
- Thank you.

54:05.482 --> 54:07.586
- So family or
relationship troubles?

54:09.965 --> 54:10.896
- Relationship.

54:14.034 --> 54:14.896
Men.

54:16.310 --> 54:17.586
- We're not all that bad.

54:20.517 --> 54:23.172
- Any progress with
the missing woman.

54:23.172 --> 54:24.620
- No, nothing yet.

54:28.034 --> 54:29.206
- I'm Susan by the way.

54:30.689 --> 54:31.517
- Jacob.

54:41.413 --> 54:44.896
- The last months
have been difficult,

54:44.896 --> 54:47.517
but before that I
was on the drink,

54:47.517 --> 54:49.310
and I hit it hard.

54:50.793 --> 54:51.689
But you helped me.

54:53.034 --> 54:54.413
You lot got me through.

54:55.827 --> 55:00.793
Fraser passed away four
days ago, and it was tough.

55:01.517 --> 55:02.931
It was so bloody hard.

55:02.931 --> 55:05.068
I miss him so much.

55:05.068 --> 55:07.931
Sometimes I think I
should just end it

55:09.310 --> 55:11.206
just to be with him again.

55:12.517 --> 55:13.448
But it's wrong.

55:16.931 --> 55:19.034
And now I've got
this one on the way.

55:22.068 --> 55:23.206
And I crave the drink.

55:24.413 --> 55:26.965
- We got you through
it once, Christine.

55:26.965 --> 55:29.172
We'll get you through it again.

55:41.655 --> 55:44.000
- Have you seen Jackie at all?

55:44.000 --> 55:46.241
Take this, just keep
an eye out for her.

55:46.241 --> 55:47.689
Thanks very much.

55:50.068 --> 55:52.379
Have you seen Jackie at all?

55:52.379 --> 55:53.931
Just keep a hold of that..

55:53.931 --> 55:55.310
Keep looking out for her.
- I'll do.

55:55.310 --> 55:56.310
- Thank you.

55:57.482 --> 55:59.965
Have any of you
see Jackie at all?

55:59.965 --> 56:02.172
Just keep out for her, hey?

56:02.172 --> 56:03.000
Thank you.

56:05.034 --> 56:07.689
Bill, have you not seen Jackie?

56:07.689 --> 56:09.137
Were you not quite close?

56:09.137 --> 56:11.620
- No, we weren't close.

56:11.620 --> 56:13.517
She was lost, and I
tried to help her.

56:14.724 --> 56:16.758
Nobody's heard from her Russell.

56:16.758 --> 56:19.000
I'm sure if they did, you'd
be the first to find out.

56:28.793 --> 56:29.793
- Coffee?

56:29.793 --> 56:30.620
- Cheers.

56:33.344 --> 56:34.655
- You know Russell, one
minute you're my sponsor,

56:34.655 --> 56:36.724
and the next you're
playing detective.

56:37.896 --> 56:38.827
Which is it, hmm?

56:40.586 --> 56:42.448
- You know it's true
as a sponsor I've got

56:42.448 --> 56:44.241
a reputation for
being pretty tough.

56:45.413 --> 56:47.517
I'm sure some would even
say a bit of a prick.

56:48.689 --> 56:50.724
But you see, Jacob,
that doesn't bother me

56:52.103 --> 56:53.965
as long as I do my job and keep
you guys clean and healthy.

56:54.965 --> 56:55.965
- What's your point?

56:57.724 --> 56:59.689
- Well you told be
you'd stopped drinking.

57:00.896 --> 57:02.724
Clearly that's
not been the case.

57:03.896 --> 57:06.241
So clearly I've not been
doing my job properly.

57:07.448 --> 57:10.206
So clearly I need to be
on your back even more.

57:11.931 --> 57:13.517
I'll be there to keep you clean.

57:14.827 --> 57:16.586
Now what was it
this Tuesday, beer,

57:17.758 --> 57:20.551
whiskey, a glass of wine?

57:20.551 --> 57:23.896
- I told you, Russell, you
don't need to worry about me.

57:25.068 --> 57:27.000
- You ever notice
that you answer me

57:27.000 --> 57:28.517
without actually answering me?

57:31.000 --> 57:32.241
- I'll take that
as a compliment.

57:32.241 --> 57:33.413
- You take that
any way you want.

57:35.172 --> 57:37.172
Just remember I'll be
keeping an eye on you

57:38.965 --> 57:40.000
for your benefit.

57:47.793 --> 57:50.620
- Not
like those putrid animals.

58:17.586 --> 58:19.275
- Yo mate, you need any eccies?

58:19.275 --> 58:20.103
- No.

58:21.103 --> 58:22.344
- You want some?

58:22.344 --> 58:23.965
- Do I look like a
pill popper to you?

58:23.965 --> 58:25.862
- Do you want me to
answer that one, mate?

58:27.413 --> 58:29.827
- Challenge my
answers one more time,

58:29.827 --> 58:31.344
and I'll make sure
your face is seen

58:31.344 --> 58:33.689
on every lamppost
with the word missing

58:33.689 --> 58:35.344
above your fucking forehead.

58:35.344 --> 58:37.000
- You fucking
threatening me, you dick?

58:37.000 --> 58:38.413
- I am.

58:38.413 --> 58:40.241
Now disappear.

58:49.448 --> 58:52.275
- What a crude,
wee, filthy asshole.

58:52.275 --> 58:54.068
I swear is he came near
me, I would beat him

58:54.068 --> 58:55.724
six ways to Sunday.

58:55.724 --> 58:57.724
- You wee, creepy
junkie, bum pot.

58:58.862 --> 59:01.517
My name's Lucy by
the way, Lucy Walker.

59:01.517 --> 59:02.344
What's your name?

59:02.344 --> 59:03.896
- It's Jacob.

59:03.896 --> 59:07.172
- Well Jacob, you look far
too classy for this place.

59:07.172 --> 59:08.000
- Thanks.

59:09.965 --> 59:11.310
- You look like you
could use a fix,

59:11.310 --> 59:14.206
so I'll go and get us
a couple of coffees,

59:14.206 --> 59:18.034
and then maybe you could
show my your feng shui.

59:18.034 --> 59:19.689
Sound good?

59:19.689 --> 59:20.620
- Yes.

59:20.620 --> 59:22.517
- All right, black or white?

59:22.517 --> 59:23.310
- Excuse me?

59:23.310 --> 59:24.896
- Your coffee.

59:24.896 --> 59:26.241
- White please.

59:26.241 --> 59:27.103
- Sugar?

59:27.103 --> 59:28.310
- No.

59:28.310 --> 59:30.724
- Me neither, we're both
sweet enough, right.

59:30.724 --> 59:32.137
Back in two secs.

59:46.724 --> 59:47.965
Well this is nice.

59:54.655 --> 59:57.241
Oh you're an artist.

59:57.241 --> 59:59.827
See I knew there was
something enticing about you.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
You know I used to do a
bit or art in third year

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.068
at school, but it wasn't for me.

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.551
And then I started modeling
for like naked paintings

01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:09.793
n'stuff, so I guess you
could call that art.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.000
- Would you like a coffee
or something stronger?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.965
- No, I don't drink.

01:00:15.965 --> 01:00:17.413
Have you seen the streets?

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:20.137
Did you know that alcohol
has made more people homeless

01:00:20.137 --> 01:00:22.862
than drugs, and I
wouldn't touch either.

01:00:22.862 --> 01:00:25.827
No, coffees fine for me, thanks.

01:00:25.827 --> 01:00:29.965
- There are worse things to
be addicted to, trust me.

01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:33.586
- So do you ever
to naked painting?

01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:34.827
What's it called again--

01:00:34.827 --> 01:00:36.517
- Life drawing.

01:00:36.517 --> 01:00:38.448
And yes, I did.

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:41.137
But I've moved into
unexplored art.

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.448
- Oh, like what?

01:00:47.965 --> 01:00:48.931
- Hello?

01:00:48.931 --> 01:00:50.206
- What are you doing back?

01:00:50.206 --> 01:00:51.965
- We thought you could
do with some company.

01:00:51.965 --> 01:00:55.137
- No, what I needed was the
exact opposite of company.

01:00:55.137 --> 01:00:56.655
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

01:00:56.655 --> 01:00:57.896
I love the dress.

01:00:57.896 --> 01:00:59.137
- Thanks.

01:00:59.137 --> 01:01:02.206
- Look we'll just
get our of your way,

01:01:02.206 --> 01:01:03.896
let you get on
with your project.

01:01:03.896 --> 01:01:04.896
- No, no, no, it's fine.

01:01:04.896 --> 01:01:06.655
It's just mismanaged.

01:01:08.448 --> 01:01:10.689
- What's the project?

01:01:10.689 --> 01:01:14.586
- Lucy sweetheart, I
think you are the project.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.793
- We've got a bottle of
wine why don't we just turn

01:01:18.793 --> 01:01:21.655
this into a kind of double date?

01:01:21.655 --> 01:01:24.344
- Right, well I don't drink.

01:01:24.344 --> 01:01:26.034
Did you know that
alcohol has made

01:01:26.034 --> 01:01:28.482
more people homeless than drugs?

01:01:28.482 --> 01:01:29.655
- Is that right?

01:01:30.965 --> 01:01:33.103
- So yeah, I tried
some fashion modeling,

01:01:33.103 --> 01:01:34.344
but it wasn't for me.

01:01:34.344 --> 01:01:36.275
Did you know I was
nearly on page three

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:38.931
until the photographer
wanted to closet shots.

01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:40.448
Sack that.

01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:43.827
I wanted to move like enter
everything at once, you know,

01:01:43.827 --> 01:01:48.034
TV, books, film, fashion,
but I could not decide.

01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:49.965
And then eventually
decided singing.

01:01:49.965 --> 01:01:52.620
But I wasn't very good at it.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.965
Not even auto-tune
could sort this voice.

01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:56.275
- Christ, I need another.

01:01:57.448 --> 01:02:01.068
- So to ask the question again,

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:03.000
what do you do for
a living, Lucy?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.482
- Honestly, I'm in between
jobs at the minute.

01:02:05.482 --> 01:02:06.655
Can you believe that?

01:02:06.655 --> 01:02:08.517
Well that's the
short version anyway.

01:02:08.517 --> 01:02:12.103
So I notice that I'm in
a one bedroom apartment,

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.103
and there's two
people living in it,

01:02:14.103 --> 01:02:17.000
so are you two going at
it, doing the naughty?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.724
- No, no, no, no, you
may be in between jobs,

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:22.965
but I'm in between homes.

01:02:22.965 --> 01:02:24.620
Jacob's just letting
me crash here

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.448
until I get back on my feet.

01:02:26.448 --> 01:02:28.482
- Ah, what a hero?

01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:31.482
See I knew there was
something special about you.

01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:33.965
No offense, but I'm glad
you two aren't together

01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:37.379
because I think I might
want this one all to myself.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:38.448
- You need to leave.

01:02:38.448 --> 01:02:39.275
- What?

01:02:39.275 --> 01:02:40.517
- Now!

01:02:40.517 --> 01:02:41.793
- Jacob, don't be
so bloody rude.

01:02:43.586 --> 01:02:48.241
- And your bang out of order.

01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:49.689
- Get your coat.

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:25.896
- My problem started
a long time ago

01:03:25.896 --> 01:03:26.827
when I was 17.

01:03:28.103 --> 01:03:30.310
I was against the world
and everything in it

01:03:31.482 --> 01:03:33.000
especially those closest to me.

01:03:34.896 --> 01:03:36.379
But nothing came
close to when I got

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:40.413
some alone time to release
that monster inside me.

01:03:41.379 --> 01:03:43.172
I'm not religious.

01:03:43.172 --> 01:03:44.620
I remember seeing a funeral.

01:03:45.827 --> 01:03:50.000
There was a boy, a boy
who used to bully me.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.586
His dad crashed a car.

01:03:51.586 --> 01:03:52.413
The boy died.

01:03:53.827 --> 01:03:57.344
Before he died, I prayed
for that boy's death.

01:03:59.689 --> 01:04:02.482
The week after, I
turned to drink.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.965
So you see you're
addiction might've made

01:04:08.965 --> 01:04:11.724
you do bad things,
but that doesn't mean

01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:12.965
to say you're bad people.

01:04:14.758 --> 01:04:15.793
Thanks very much.

01:04:19.172 --> 01:04:20.379
- Do you know I think
that's the first time

01:04:20.379 --> 01:04:21.862
somebody's actually
stood up here and spoke,

01:04:21.862 --> 01:04:24.689
and you've paid attention
to what they've said.

01:04:24.689 --> 01:04:26.448
- You should get him
to speak more often

01:04:26.448 --> 01:04:28.068
maybe even run these groups.

01:04:29.482 --> 01:04:31.655
- Raymond's spoken here
before, Jacob, a few times.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.379
Maybe his words are just
having an impact on you

01:04:35.379 --> 01:04:37.758
'cause you wanna give up
your Tuesday sessions.

01:04:40.103 --> 01:04:42.068
Why a Tuesday anyway?

01:04:42.068 --> 01:04:43.724
What's so special
about Tuesdays?

01:04:43.724 --> 01:04:46.482
- I'm trying to appreciate
Raymond's words.

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:47.551
- But what's so special
about Raymond's words

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:48.551
all of a sudden?

01:04:49.689 --> 01:04:52.586
- Being an addict isn't
your fault no matter

01:04:52.586 --> 01:04:54.275
what the addiction is.

01:04:57.206 --> 01:04:58.655
- Why do I get the
feeling you're talking

01:04:58.655 --> 01:05:00.379
about more than alcohol here?

01:05:03.827 --> 01:05:04.931
- That's because I am.

01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:12.068
Hey Russell, I'm no canary.

01:05:14.413 --> 01:05:16.586
But Bill was looking
rather bug eyed.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.827
Keep him close.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.620
- Police have
appealed for the public's help

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.310
in tracing a missing
24 year old girl.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:37.241
Lisa Cane was last seen in
the South side of Glasgow

01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:39.965
around 7:30 p.m. on the
seventh of February.

01:05:39.965 --> 01:05:41.862
Her family has not
heard from her since

01:05:41.862 --> 01:05:43.620
and are concerned
for her wellbeing.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.689
Lisa left Vincent Bar after
a falling out with friends.

01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:49.103
She is described as
around five foot tall,

01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:51.758
of slim to medium build
with long blonde hair,

01:05:51.758 --> 01:05:54.413
blue eyes, and a
fair complexion.

01:05:57.793 --> 01:06:00.448
- You can stay with
one of us tonight.

01:06:00.448 --> 01:06:01.379
We'll take care of you.

01:06:01.379 --> 01:06:04.137
- I don't need taking care of.

01:06:04.137 --> 01:06:05.724
I'm not a wean.

01:06:05.724 --> 01:06:06.758
I need Fraser.

01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:11.896
- Fraser's gone Christine.

01:06:13.206 --> 01:06:14.620
I'm sorry, but he is.

01:06:16.103 --> 01:06:18.000
And if you turn
back to the booze,

01:06:18.931 --> 01:06:20.241
you won't last long either.

01:06:20.241 --> 01:06:23.517
- Bill, saying she
won't last long either

01:06:23.517 --> 01:06:26.310
aren't exactly the
best choices of words

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:29.241
when she just wants to
be with your husband.

01:06:29.241 --> 01:06:32.689
- How 'bout you drop
the smart arse routine

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.448
and offer up some help?

01:06:34.448 --> 01:06:37.344
- I can't bring up
this baby on my own.

01:06:38.448 --> 01:06:41.000
What kind of life will it have?

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.068
- Excuse me.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.034
Mr. Partlow, what
are you doing here?

01:07:00.241 --> 01:07:05.172
I contact you, not
the other way around.

01:07:06.034 --> 01:07:07.586
- So do you want them or not?

01:07:07.586 --> 01:07:10.827
- You brought them here
to an addiction group?

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:12.931
Are you that moronic?

01:07:12.931 --> 01:07:14.068
- Isn't it for alcoholics?

01:07:14.068 --> 01:07:15.310
- It doesn't matter
what it's for.

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:17.172
- Well right now,
you're my customer.

01:07:17.172 --> 01:07:18.689
So you buying or not?

01:07:20.965 --> 01:07:22.103
What about the payment?

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:27.896
- It will be in a
birthday card as always.

01:07:31.862 --> 01:07:34.448
And it doesn't matter
if it's five days,

01:07:34.448 --> 01:07:39.448
five months, or five years,
I contact you, understand?

01:08:08.206 --> 01:08:09.793
How are you feeling, Christine?

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.448
- Like shit.

01:08:13.896 --> 01:08:15.068
How do you think I feel?

01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:25.103
- I was listening to
Raymond very carefully

01:08:25.103 --> 01:08:28.310
about what he said about
good people and bad people,

01:08:28.310 --> 01:08:29.136
and he's right.

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:34.068
Wanting to end your life
doesn't make you a bad person.

01:08:35.724 --> 01:08:36.827
You miss your husband.

01:08:38.344 --> 01:08:41.310
I believe love is doing whatever
you can to be with someone.

01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:43.965
Love isn't a bad thing.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.689
So don't let anyone get in
the way of it, Christine.

01:08:49.103 --> 01:08:50.103
- Thank you.

01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:53.758
- You're welcome.

01:08:56.068 --> 01:08:59.517
Listen my Tuesday nights
are usually quite free.

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:02.758
If you need someone to talk
to, you're more than welcome

01:09:02.758 --> 01:09:03.586
to come to mine.

01:09:05.412 --> 01:09:06.241
- Please.

01:09:08.758 --> 01:09:09.586
- Okay.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.379
But we'll keep it between
us for now, all right?

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:25.862
- Someone's birthday?

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:30.206
- Just an art supplier's.

01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:33.930
- Haven't seen you
since last Tuesday

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:35.862
when you had your
little outburst.

01:09:35.862 --> 01:09:37.930
- Different shift patterns.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:39.412
- Totally see you weren't
really interested,

01:09:39.412 --> 01:09:41.654
but I think she got a
message along for a tutor.

01:09:41.654 --> 01:09:42.827
- Thank you.

01:09:42.827 --> 01:09:44.412
- Figured you weren't
really into her.

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:45.758
- We have different tastes.

01:09:45.758 --> 01:09:47.000
- Right.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.930
My question is why'd
you have her over here

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:50.310
if you hate her that much?

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:55.310
- Look can we just drop
last Tuesday please?

01:09:55.793 --> 01:09:56.517
- Okay.

01:09:57.931 --> 01:10:00.655
Well one good thing
did come out of it.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:02.034
I got another date with Sam.

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:04.379
- Really?

01:10:04.379 --> 01:10:05.655
- Yeah, he was
actually really nice.

01:10:05.655 --> 01:10:08.000
He made an effort
not to get drunk

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.275
well at least till
we got back here,

01:10:09.275 --> 01:10:11.482
and he paid for the whole night.

01:10:12.413 --> 01:10:13.310
- Congratulations.

01:10:15.413 --> 01:10:18.793
- So when's date
number two, hmm?

01:10:18.793 --> 01:10:20.931
- Well we decided
to wait a week.

01:10:22.068 --> 01:10:25.275
I thought that I would
let you have the privacy

01:10:25.275 --> 01:10:26.551
that I never gave you last week,

01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:30.310
or the week before last,
or the week before last.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.103
- Stop.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.103
It's fine.

01:10:36.103 --> 01:10:36.965
We're fine.

01:10:38.482 --> 01:10:40.379
I have to go post this.

01:11:48.793 --> 01:11:50.586
- I had a miscarriage.

01:11:52.448 --> 01:11:55.206
And in a sick kind of
way, I was grateful.

01:11:56.448 --> 01:11:58.517
If you ever needed
anybody that much,

01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:05.137
don't you think you'd,
would to do anything

01:12:05.137 --> 01:12:07.000
to be with them?

01:13:19.965 --> 01:13:22.517
- Jacob, I need to talk to you.

01:13:23.724 --> 01:13:25.655
Jacob, I know you're in there.

01:13:25.655 --> 01:13:26.896
Open the door.

01:13:29.586 --> 01:13:32.000
Jacob, I need to talk to you.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.206
- Good evening Russell.

01:13:38.551 --> 01:13:39.379
- Evening.

01:13:43.413 --> 01:13:45.241
What's with the boxes?

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.068
- Art work.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.862
- This
is a nice place.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:54.620
- Russell, why are you here?

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:55.827
- I was just passing by.

01:13:57.793 --> 01:13:59.000
- At 10 o'clock at night?

01:14:00.344 --> 01:14:01.827
- Is that water in that glass?

01:14:03.275 --> 01:14:05.586
- Take a sip and find
out, or will the taste

01:14:05.586 --> 01:14:09.103
of alcohol throw you
over the edge again?

01:14:09.103 --> 01:14:11.000
Tell me Russell,
how're the kids, hmm?

01:14:15.206 --> 01:14:18.793
- I lost my partner and
then turned to drink.

01:14:18.793 --> 01:14:20.448
And no excuse is
ever a good one.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.517
What's your story?

01:14:23.517 --> 01:14:26.482
- I simply have a taste for
it, but I can assure you,

01:14:26.482 --> 01:14:28.586
Russell, there's just
water in that glass.

01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:34.931
- Look let's say I
believe you, and I do.

01:14:36.068 --> 01:14:37.758
But I'm your sponsor.

01:14:37.758 --> 01:14:39.551
I need to ask you these things.

01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.103
- No, you're only my
sponsor when it suits you.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:45.275
- You told me about your wee
drink on a Tuesday night,

01:14:45.275 --> 01:14:47.344
and yet for two weeks,
you've not touched a drop.

01:14:48.448 --> 01:14:49.517
Why the change?

01:14:50.758 --> 01:14:52.931
- Let's say unexpected company.

01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:55.724
- Didn't appear to be
any here when I arrived.

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:56.793
- Unexpectedly.

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:02.103
No Russell, are we done
playing detective here?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.862
- Fair enough.

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:08.620
May I use your toilet
before I leave?

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.517
- No, you may not.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:12.620
Now get out.

01:16:07.275 --> 01:16:08.103
- Jacob?

01:16:09.758 --> 01:16:10.655
Hello?

01:16:13.551 --> 01:16:14.413
Anybody home?

01:16:20.724 --> 01:16:22.310
Hello?

01:16:36.931 --> 01:16:38.034
Jacob?

01:16:38.896 --> 01:16:39.724
You in there, pal?

01:18:01.034 --> 01:18:03.103
- I would like to pay
for two months rent

01:18:03.103 --> 01:18:05.620
on container one,
one, two please.

01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:09.206
- Name?

01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:11.103
- Gary Lutz.

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:13.310
- Cash or card?

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:14.137
- Cash.

01:18:16.586 --> 01:18:18.827
- I'll leave it for the
manager in the morning.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.379
- The
person you are calling

01:18:28.379 --> 01:18:30.310
can't come to the
phone right now.

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:32.344
Please leave your
message after the beep.

01:18:33.862 --> 01:18:35.103
- Jacob, how you doing?

01:18:35.103 --> 01:18:36.586
It's Sam.

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:38.310
Listen me and Norma were
just leaving the pub, right.

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:40.068
But I thought I'd
just swing by and get

01:18:40.068 --> 01:18:41.655
a quick chat with you.

01:18:41.655 --> 01:18:44.448
But that wee outburst you
had with that Lucy girl,

01:18:44.448 --> 01:18:45.689
it got me thinking.

01:18:45.689 --> 01:18:48.344
I've got an idea that
can help you relieve

01:18:48.344 --> 01:18:50.103
some of that stress.

01:18:51.586 --> 01:18:53.206
Listen I'll see you
soon, mate okay?

01:18:53.206 --> 01:18:55.448
Oh, I'm getting away now.

01:19:28.379 --> 01:19:30.000
- It's not his usual seat.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.724
- It's not his
usual drink either.

01:19:31.724 --> 01:19:34.172
He's been acting weird
every since he got back.

01:19:34.172 --> 01:19:36.068
- Have you got any
extra hours going?

01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:37.724
- Sure, when for?

01:19:37.724 --> 01:19:38.551
- Now.

01:19:40.379 --> 01:19:41.206
- Now?

01:19:51.517 --> 01:19:53.068
- Got your message.

01:19:55.758 --> 01:19:56.586
Where's Norma?

01:20:01.103 --> 01:20:06.103
- She's at home,
my home actually.

01:20:06.724 --> 01:20:07.965
- Your home?

01:20:07.965 --> 01:20:11.103
- Well you've hardly
been yourself lately,

01:20:11.103 --> 01:20:12.931
Jacob, have you?

01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:14.413
- I've had a lot on, Sam.

01:20:17.068 --> 01:20:18.275
- Well here's the deal.

01:20:19.724 --> 01:20:20.724
I like Norma.

01:20:22.206 --> 01:20:24.517
And despite my many
faults which you were

01:20:24.517 --> 01:20:29.068
so kind as to point
out, she likes me.

01:20:35.241 --> 01:20:37.379
- Have you got something
you want to tell me, Sam?

01:20:39.137 --> 01:20:43.862
- I think Norma should
pack up all her belongings

01:20:43.862 --> 01:20:47.517
and move in with me
where she's safe.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:50.793
- Safe?

01:20:53.275 --> 01:20:57.655
I've seen the way
you treat women.

01:21:01.448 --> 01:21:06.206
- Yeah pal, I don't
think it's my bad habits

01:21:06.206 --> 01:21:08.034
that are the problem here.

01:21:11.862 --> 01:21:14.068
- You do what you have to, Sam.

01:21:32.965 --> 01:21:35.206
How 'bout I take him home?

01:21:35.206 --> 01:21:36.000
- You sure?

01:21:37.827 --> 01:21:39.896
- As long as you pay me
for the rest of the shift.

01:21:43.793 --> 01:21:44.896
Nice and easy.

01:21:46.206 --> 01:21:47.172
Nice and easy.

01:21:49.482 --> 01:21:51.000
- What are you doing?

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
- Nice and easy.

01:22:10.068 --> 01:22:11.137
- You taking us home?

01:22:12.586 --> 01:22:13.413
- Of course.

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:21.103
- You're some man,
Jacob, you know that?

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.413
The best.

01:22:22.413 --> 01:22:23.758
- Thank you.

01:22:23.758 --> 01:22:25.689
Now get some rest, hey.

01:22:32.517 --> 01:22:36.172
- Hey you're going
the wrong way.

01:22:36.172 --> 01:22:37.931
- Oh no, no, this
way's a shortcut.

01:22:41.172 --> 01:22:43.586
- Oh my head's bouncing, man.

01:22:46.965 --> 01:22:49.827
- Here take one of these.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:09.310
- These air fresheners
used to last for months.

01:26:12.482 --> 01:26:13.310
Not anymore.

01:26:15.827 --> 01:26:19.965
Everything is just so cheap
and worthless nowadays.

01:26:19.965 --> 01:26:24.965
Everything is just
copied, regurgitated,

01:26:27.379 --> 01:26:29.379
then just spat back out.

01:26:31.862 --> 01:26:35.172
There's no love for
originality anymore.

01:26:43.586 --> 01:26:47.137
So how's the headache, hmm?

01:26:51.448 --> 01:26:53.931
I'm going to remove
this piece of cloth.

01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:10.034
You're very quiet, Sam.

01:27:13.206 --> 01:27:16.344
It makes it difficult to
tell what you're thinking.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.310
And for someone who's
been left in the dark

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:24.000
and constrained to a
chair, you don't seem

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.931
particularly perturbed.

01:27:31.896 --> 01:27:34.068
- This is a wind
up or something.

01:27:34.068 --> 01:27:35.862
Some wind up or joke.

01:27:40.034 --> 01:27:44.034
- Tell me something,
Sam, what day is today?

01:27:49.793 --> 01:27:50.793
- Wednesday.

01:27:52.655 --> 01:27:53.482
It's a Wednesday?

01:27:53.482 --> 01:27:54.310
- That's right.

01:27:55.275 --> 01:27:56.103
Wednesday.

01:27:57.551 --> 01:28:00.517
I don't particularly
like to get myself

01:28:00.517 --> 01:28:03.862
into these circumstances
on a Wednesday.

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.862
- What is this place?

01:28:13.344 --> 01:28:15.413
- That's a story
for another day.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Now what did you see, and
what did you tell Norma?

01:28:24.448 --> 01:28:26.068
- Nothing.

01:28:26.068 --> 01:28:27.517
- Tell me.

01:28:27.517 --> 01:28:28.344
- Nothing.

01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:30.758
- Tell me.

01:28:35.379 --> 01:28:36.724
- I don't know.

01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:42.310
- It's okay.

01:29:22.344 --> 01:29:24.517
- Look I saw the ribcage.

01:29:27.241 --> 01:29:30.206
- I wasn't hiding it.

01:29:35.275 --> 01:29:38.241
- I don't know what
you've done, Jacob.

01:29:40.482 --> 01:29:42.137
Maybe you've hurt
somebody accidentally--

01:29:42.137 --> 01:29:43.758
- Ha, accidentally?

01:29:48.172 --> 01:29:49.413
Tell me something, Sam.

01:29:51.931 --> 01:29:54.137
What makes you think it
was an accident, hmm?

01:29:57.965 --> 01:30:02.965
- What, no.

01:30:03.793 --> 01:30:06.034
No, I know you.

01:30:07.413 --> 01:30:09.724
You're an artist, and
you've got your project

01:30:09.724 --> 01:30:11.586
that you work on.

01:30:11.586 --> 01:30:15.344
- Do you want to know
what my project is?

01:30:27.448 --> 01:30:31.413
I eradicate people.

01:30:34.068 --> 01:30:34.931
That's right.

01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:41.724
Every Tuesday night, I find
my insignificant victim,

01:30:42.517 --> 01:30:44.620
and I simply kill them.

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:49.103
- No.

01:30:53.241 --> 01:30:54.793
We've been pals for years.

01:30:54.793 --> 01:30:56.206
- Ha pals?

01:31:02.344 --> 01:31:03.620
We're not pals.

01:31:04.482 --> 01:31:05.827
I used you, Sam.

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:11.137
The pigs,

01:31:15.034 --> 01:31:16.655
your precious pigs.

01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:21.586
- Look, look Jacob, I
don't know anything.

01:31:21.586 --> 01:31:23.241
I don't, plus I
didn't tell anyone.

01:31:23.241 --> 01:31:24.275
I promise.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.793
I'm not getting
out of here, am I?

01:31:30.793 --> 01:31:31.793
- I'm afraid not.

01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.172
- Sam, I don't
know where you are,

01:31:35.172 --> 01:31:37.172
but your car's
outside your house.

01:31:37.172 --> 01:31:38.034
Will you call me?

01:31:49.551 --> 01:31:51.275
- Hi, who are you?

01:31:51.275 --> 01:31:53.241
- Excuse me, you just
knocked on my door.

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.862
- Unless you're a
friend of Jacob's.

01:31:57.206 --> 01:31:58.172
Is he in?

01:31:58.172 --> 01:31:59.413
- No, I've no idea where he is.

01:32:00.931 --> 01:32:02.379
- My friend just went missing.

01:32:03.793 --> 01:32:05.965
I was supposed to meet her
tonight, but she stood me up.

01:32:05.965 --> 01:32:09.586
- You couldn't have made
much of an impression, hey.

01:32:09.586 --> 01:32:11.551
- Yeah well she's
been depressed,

01:32:11.551 --> 01:32:13.655
so I phoned a few
of her friends.

01:32:13.655 --> 01:32:16.068
Apparently, she'd arranged
to meet Jacob tonight.

01:32:17.241 --> 01:32:18.517
I just wondered
if she showed up.

01:32:18.517 --> 01:32:19.931
- No, don't think so.

01:32:21.275 --> 01:32:22.827
I been staying with
Jacob the last few weeks,

01:32:22.827 --> 01:32:25.000
and he's always got this
art thing on a Tuesday.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.448
- He told me about his painting.

01:32:27.448 --> 01:32:28.275
He doodles.

01:32:29.724 --> 01:32:32.413
But see it was him
that invited her round.

01:32:34.068 --> 01:32:35.103
You all right?

01:32:39.034 --> 01:32:40.965
- I'll tell Jacob you came
round when he gets back,

01:32:40.965 --> 01:32:43.586
but that's the best I can do.

01:32:45.137 --> 01:32:46.034
- I appreciate it.

01:32:49.413 --> 01:32:53.724
Christine, the girl's who's
missing, she's pregnant.

01:33:00.965 --> 01:33:03.620
- All the fuckin' time.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.103
All this fucking
time I've known you,

01:33:05.103 --> 01:33:10.000
you've been some sort
of funking Ian Brady,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.275
Mayra Hindley, Fred
West motherfucker.

01:33:12.275 --> 01:33:16.862
- And don't forget good
old Jack the Ripper

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.413
although he never got caught.

01:33:23.241 --> 01:33:27.827
As for the rest of 'em,
why would I idolize

01:33:27.827 --> 01:33:30.000
such pathetic scum?

01:33:31.517 --> 01:33:33.034
- You think you're
better than them do you?

01:33:33.034 --> 01:33:35.931
- I'm a saint compared to
those distasteful beasts.

01:33:35.931 --> 01:33:39.103
- You are going to get caught!

01:33:39.103 --> 01:33:40.965
- The only ones that get caught

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.517
are the ones who make mistakes.

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:53.551
Tuesday nights, I kill the
same Brit on the same night.

01:34:08.068 --> 01:34:13.068
It's good to have stability.

01:34:19.413 --> 01:34:20.275
- Yes, yes.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.551
- Then you come along, and
rattle much fucking cage!

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.448
- Morning.

01:35:24.241 --> 01:35:25.862
- Morning.

01:35:25.862 --> 01:35:27.137
- Where were you?

01:35:27.137 --> 01:35:30.793
- Took a shift at the
pub and as per usual,

01:35:30.793 --> 01:35:34.068
Sam surpassed his limits,
so I took him home.

01:35:35.344 --> 01:35:37.758
- I was at Sam's I
never saw you there.

01:35:37.758 --> 01:35:38.862
- I never went inside.

01:35:39.793 --> 01:35:40.862
- You're lying to me.

01:35:42.034 --> 01:35:43.241
- Good night, Norma.

01:35:43.241 --> 01:35:44.827
- What's the Tuesday
project, Jacob?

01:35:50.172 --> 01:35:52.724
- What's with all
the questions, Norma?

01:35:52.724 --> 01:35:54.931
- Sam's not answering his phone.

01:35:54.931 --> 01:35:59.137
You said you took him
home, but he's not there.

01:35:59.137 --> 01:36:00.724
I mean we all have
secrets, right?

01:36:00.724 --> 01:36:02.137
Things we want to
keep you ourselves,

01:36:02.137 --> 01:36:05.551
but you are on a
different level.

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:08.379
- We all have things we want
to keep to ourselves, Norma.

01:36:10.758 --> 01:36:11.862
It's not a crime.

01:36:17.034 --> 01:36:19.241
- Do you want to know
what my secret is, do you?

01:36:20.413 --> 01:36:22.620
I don't have cancer.

01:36:25.172 --> 01:36:26.275
I made it up.

01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:29.206
- I watched you vomit.

01:36:29.206 --> 01:36:30.448
Christ, I had the flu.

01:36:30.448 --> 01:36:31.482
I've been living on
the street for months.

01:36:31.482 --> 01:36:33.517
I'm bound to sick, am I not?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.965
I thought I needed you like
when we were back in school.

01:36:39.655 --> 01:36:42.206
So happy to see you,
Jacob, I used you.

01:36:43.689 --> 01:36:45.000
But you're not worth it.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.137
I mean your twisted mood swings,

01:36:48.137 --> 01:36:51.000
randoms showing up
looking for missing women.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.379
- Missing woman,
what missing woman?

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.206
Norma, what's wrong with you?

01:36:57.206 --> 01:36:58.793
- I took a paracetamol
from your bathroom.

01:36:58.793 --> 01:37:00.827
- Norma, what missing woman?

01:37:01.758 --> 01:37:03.103
He said her name was Christine.

01:37:03.103 --> 01:37:04.551
- He said?

01:37:04.551 --> 01:37:05.724
Who said that, Norma?

01:37:06.793 --> 01:37:08.275
- Your mystery friend Russell.

01:37:10.586 --> 01:37:11.517
- Russell was here?

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:15.758
- What's your Tuesday
project, Jacob?

01:37:15.758 --> 01:37:16.827
- My project?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.620
You want to know
what my project is?

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.172
- Hey Cleek, I've
told you before

01:37:31.172 --> 01:37:32.448
your not for this
neck of the woods,

01:37:32.448 --> 01:37:33.413
so stop cutting through it.

01:37:33.413 --> 01:37:34.931
- We go to the same school.

01:37:34.931 --> 01:37:37.551
We live in the same area.

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:38.896
- And what?

01:37:38.896 --> 01:37:40.620
- Don't.
- What are you going to do?

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.931
- Leave him alone Kenneth.

01:37:43.206 --> 01:37:48.206
- Norma Bagwell, you
know I don't get you.

01:37:49.413 --> 01:37:50.827
One minute you want
me deep inside you,

01:37:50.827 --> 01:37:52.517
then you're hanging
about with this retard.

01:37:52.517 --> 01:37:54.310
- So because I'm paying
him some attention,

01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:55.793
you kick the shit out of him?

01:37:55.793 --> 01:37:57.931
Mature Kenneth, really mature.

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:05.413
- Thought that beating I
gave you last month was bad,

01:38:05.413 --> 01:38:07.344
just wait till you see what's
coming next, you wee shit.

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.758
- It's pretty dark in there.

01:38:18.758 --> 01:38:20.448
Nobody ever goes deep inside.

01:38:43.137 --> 01:38:46.586
- It wasn't what you
did, it was how easy

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:48.689
we got away with it.

01:38:53.137 --> 01:38:55.034
You carried on as
if nothing happened.

01:38:58.172 --> 01:38:59.896
I couldn't do that.

01:39:07.551 --> 01:39:08.931
I had to try it again.

01:39:10.551 --> 01:39:12.310
- Right, let's go.

01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:14.896
- Pick someone at
random, a stranger.

01:39:16.482 --> 01:39:19.413
It became my hobby,
my pet project.

01:39:22.034 --> 01:39:24.000
And then you came back.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.413
And now you know too much.

01:40:17.896 --> 01:40:19.793
Good morning, could
I please have a taxi?

01:40:19.793 --> 01:40:21.275
- When for?

01:40:21.275 --> 01:40:22.448
- Yes, for now.

01:40:22.448 --> 01:40:23.931
What's the address?

01:40:23.931 --> 01:40:26.068
- It's one, two,
seven Renton Street.

01:40:26.068 --> 01:40:26.931
- The name?

01:40:26.931 --> 01:40:28.137
- Yeah, Cleek.

01:40:28.137 --> 01:40:29.068
- Okay
as soon as we can.

01:40:29.068 --> 01:40:30.000
- Okay, thank you.

01:40:48.172 --> 01:40:50.034
Good morning Russell.

01:40:50.034 --> 01:40:50.862
- Morning.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.344
I was here a few hours ago.

01:40:58.275 --> 01:40:59.655
That girl said you were out.

01:41:03.034 --> 01:41:05.758
- Yes, Norma did say
you were looking for me,

01:41:05.758 --> 01:41:06.793
hence the phone call.

01:41:06.793 --> 01:41:08.517
- Where is she this Norma girl?

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:10.689
Did she mention Christine?

01:41:10.689 --> 01:41:12.206
- Christine?

01:41:12.206 --> 01:41:14.206
I'm afraid not.

01:41:14.206 --> 01:41:17.103
Norma's way back to
Ireland some bother

01:41:17.103 --> 01:41:18.517
with an ex-junkie boyfriend.

01:41:19.689 --> 01:41:21.896
- Is she another one of
your distant friends?

01:41:23.827 --> 01:41:25.137
- Russell, why do I
get the impression

01:41:25.137 --> 01:41:27.034
you're not here to
talk about Norma, hmm?

01:41:27.034 --> 01:41:30.172
- Because you arranged to
meet Christine last night,

01:41:30.172 --> 01:41:32.655
and now nobody can
get ahold of her.

01:41:32.655 --> 01:41:35.517
That's strange don't
you think considering

01:41:35.517 --> 01:41:37.275
you were out all night?

01:41:37.275 --> 01:41:39.448
- It is strange.

01:41:39.448 --> 01:41:41.620
And that's what I thought
when she didn't show up.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.827
As for me being out all
night, after our conversation

01:41:45.827 --> 01:41:48.103
I took a shift at the
pub, and then I met

01:41:48.103 --> 01:41:50.896
up with a friend,
and I'm afraid to say

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:53.206
it got rather messy.

01:41:54.551 --> 01:41:56.655
- And your friend,
what's his name?

01:41:56.655 --> 01:41:58.103
- Sam McBride.

01:41:58.103 --> 01:42:01.620
- This Sam, he'll be
able to corroborate this?

01:42:03.068 --> 01:42:03.931
- Corroborate?

01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:07.931
Yeah, he'll be able
to corroborate it

01:42:07.931 --> 01:42:09.310
if you can get ahold of him.

01:42:10.448 --> 01:42:12.310
You see Sam and Norma
became very close,

01:42:13.655 --> 01:42:17.862
so he left with her to
protect her from this junkie.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.620
And I think it's time I
found myself a new sponsor

01:42:24.551 --> 01:42:27.034
'cause I've had quite
enough of these harassments.

01:42:28.586 --> 01:42:31.344
Now if you'll excuse me?

01:42:55.517 --> 01:42:56.689
Shush.

01:42:57.827 --> 01:42:59.827
Shush.

01:43:02.206 --> 01:43:03.965
I wish I could make
it more humane.

01:43:05.655 --> 01:43:06.482
Don't worry.

01:43:07.379 --> 01:43:08.379
They will find you.

01:43:10.103 --> 01:43:13.103
You will be my last
ever victim here,

01:43:13.103 --> 01:43:14.827
and the only one
ever to be found.

01:43:16.172 --> 01:43:17.827
I truly am sorry.

01:43:57.103 --> 01:43:58.206
Good morning Susan.

01:43:58.206 --> 01:43:59.310
- Morning.

01:43:59.310 --> 01:44:00.137
- Running late today?

01:44:00.137 --> 01:44:00.965
- Just a little.

01:44:05.482 --> 01:44:08.344
Jacob, I was wondering if
you'd like to go out sometime

01:44:09.448 --> 01:44:12.724
for a coffee,
lunch, even dinner.

01:44:12.724 --> 01:44:14.586
- Are you free Tuesday nights?

01:44:14.586 --> 01:44:16.517
- Afraid not, I work
late on a Tuesday.

01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:19.758
Why Tuesdays?

01:44:20.758 --> 01:44:21.586
- No reason.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.310
Isn't that your bus coming?

01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:35.172
How 'bout Wednesday?

01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:11.931
- What you reading?

01:45:13.517 --> 01:45:15.000
- Do you remember that
woman who was killed

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.034
in an alley the week before
we went on our first date?

01:45:18.551 --> 01:45:19.379
- Vaguely.

01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:26.379
- Well it seems that
a tissue containing

01:45:26.379 --> 01:45:28.655
her saliva was found
in a self storage park

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:30.379
along with several other bodies.

01:45:30.379 --> 01:45:31.620
What did you see?

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.034
It says that on the
tissue there were

01:45:33.034 --> 01:45:34.862
specks of blood from a
mechanic named Richard Foster,

01:45:34.862 --> 01:45:37.172
and he's the main suspect.

01:45:37.172 --> 01:45:39.000
The self storage
container was opened

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.620
when the rent on the
property hadn't been paid

01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.034
for several months.

01:45:42.034 --> 01:45:44.310
The tenant paid in
cash, and police believe

01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:47.758
the name used Gary Lutz is
fake, and there might be

01:45:47.758 --> 01:45:51.517
a serial killer or
killers targeting women.

01:45:53.379 --> 01:45:54.896
- Why are you so interested?

01:45:57.103 --> 01:45:58.000
- It's just scary.

01:46:00.379 --> 01:46:01.724
You could've been a victim.

01:46:04.379 --> 01:46:06.793
- Well I'm just glad
we moved to the country

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.206
where it's safe.

01:46:09.758 --> 01:46:11.275
I'll go fix us some lunch, hey?

01:46:34.551 --> 01:46:36.724
Jacob, that's lunch ready.

01:46:39.931 --> 01:46:42.000
There's actually something
else I kinda wanted

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.931
to talk to you about.

01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:47.241
It ties in with living
in a safe place.

01:46:47.241 --> 01:46:49.172
- I look forward to it.

01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:53.517
- Anyway,
I'll make up some tea.

01:46:57.172 --> 01:47:01.931
- I believe the next few months
will be very interesting.
