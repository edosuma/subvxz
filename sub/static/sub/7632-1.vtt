02:10.960 --> 02:13.520
"Me and you, us never part"

02:45.040 --> 02:48.555
Celie! Nettie!
Come back to the house now.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.310
Girls, your mama got supper.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.632
Celie, you got the ugliest smile
this side of Creation.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.072
Ain't you done yet?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.393
A girl!

04:28.240 --> 04:29.673

04:37.520 --> 04:40.080
You better not tell nobody but God.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.992

Dear God...

04:51.920 --> 04:53.990
...l'm fourteen years old.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.030
I've always been a good girl.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.560
Maybe you can give me a sign.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.996
Let me know whas happening to me.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.671
One day, my daddy come and say,
"You gonna do what your mama wouldn't."

05:11.120 --> 05:14.317
Now, I got two children by my daddy.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.593
A baby boy called Adam,
he took while I was sleeping...

05:20.720 --> 05:22.836
...and a baby girl called Olivia...

05:24.400 --> 05:26.630
...that he took right out of my arms.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.472
Then my mama died...

05:31.320 --> 05:33.231
...cursing and screaming...

05:34.320 --> 05:36.311
...because her heart been broke.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.954
Dear God, he act like
he can't stand me no more.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.480
I don't think he kilt my baby boy.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.559
I heard he sold it
to a preacher and his wife.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.878
I keep hoping he'll find somebody to marry.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.670
I seen him looking at my little sister.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.193
She's scared.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.035
But I say, "I'll take care of you,
with Goďs help."

06:35.600 --> 06:40.230
Dear God, he come home with a girl
from around the town called Gray.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.874

but they getting married now.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.834
My little sister, Nettie, has got
a man always looking at her.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.631
His wife dead. She was killed by
her boyfriend, coming home from church.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.871
He got three children.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.032

06:59.280 --> 07:02.955
Now every Sunday evening,

07:42.360 --> 07:44.590

07:45.360 --> 07:47.920
I got nobody to watch over my young'uns.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.711
They be fighting and bleeding
and throwing up on the floor...

07:53.240 --> 07:55.151
...while I got a farm to run.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.280
I'll take right good care of your Nettie.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.951
I can't let you have Nettie.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.714
She too young.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.838
But I tell you what.
I can let you have Celie.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.390
She oldest and should marry first.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.078
She ain't fresh, but I expect you know that.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.311
She's spoiled... twice.

08:18.840 --> 08:19.989
Celie is ugly...

08:20.080 --> 08:22.469
...but she works hard, and she can learn.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.113
And God fixed her.

08:24.400 --> 08:28.234
You can do what you like.
She won't make you feed or clothe it.

08:29.040 --> 08:33.352
But Nettie, you flat out can't have.
Not now, not never.

08:35.600 --> 08:39.433
Well, I ain't never looked
at the other one before.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.991
Let me see her again.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.880
Celie, Mister want another look at you.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.311
Move up. He won't bite.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.475
Turn around.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.391
What you doing that for?

09:09.680 --> 09:11.955
Your sister's thinking about marriage.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.240
Why y'all standing out here waiting?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.552
This here's your new mammy.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.312
She ain't my mammy.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.352
I don't cry.

10:13.840 --> 10:18.311
I laid there thinking about Nettie,
while he on top of me.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.871
Wonder if she's safe.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.676
Then I think about
that pretty woman in the picture.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.517
I know what he doing to me,
he done to her.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.391
And maybe she like it.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.833
Jesus!

11:39.120 --> 11:41.839
Harpo, didn't I tell you to clean my saddle?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.752
I did do it, Pa.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.470
Look at the mold on the side.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.315
Look at the dirt on it.
This don't look like is clean.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.996
The new mule, Joey, had it.
I couldn't get it from him.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.992
He was biting and kicking on it.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.548
When's the last time
their hair was combed?

11:58.800 --> 12:00.677
Not since their mammy did it.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.878
I'll have to shave it off.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.078
No! Is bad luck to cut a woman's hair.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.152
This'll take all day.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.713
Shut up!

12:13.200 --> 12:15.111
I can't. It hurts her.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.232
Don't talk back to me.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.192
You do what I tell you.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.078
Dear God, I seen my baby girl.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.313
I know it was her.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.870
She looked just like me and my daddy.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.589
Like more us than us is ourself.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.912
My little girl looks like
she fretting over something.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.157
She got my eyes, just like they is today.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.678
Like everything I see, she's seeing.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.592
Thas real pretty.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.799
I'm making me and my
little girl a new dress.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.036
Her daddy will be so pleased.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.793
Who her daddy?

13:39.120 --> 13:40.235
Mr. Samuel.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.115
Mr. Samuel... who he?

13:43.920 --> 13:45.558
The Reverend Mr. Samuel.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.877
You want that cloth or not?
We got other customers.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.919
Yes, sir. I want five yards, sir.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.593
You want something?

13:59.440 --> 14:01.670
How long you had your little girl?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.389
She be seven months on the 15th.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.192
Can I hold her?

14:10.320 --> 14:11.753
If you like.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.392
I think she mine.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.472
My heart say she mine.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.711
But I don't know she mine.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.919

14:32.600 --> 14:35.956
I stitch "Olivia"
on all the seat of her diapers.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.756
I stitch a lot of little flowers
and stars, too.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.915
He took all the diapers when he took her.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.274
Whas her name?

14:44.880 --> 14:46.154
Pauline.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.311
But I calls her Olivia.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.836
Whys you call her Olivia
when that ain't her name?

15:10.640 --> 15:13.029
Don't she look like an Olivia to you?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.230
Just look at those eyes.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.440
Only somebody old would
have eyes like that.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.512
So I call her Ole Livia.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.272
Nice talking to you.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.512
My husbanďs waiting.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.272

16:42.600 --> 16:46.434
I just couldn't keep him off me.
Could I stay here with you?

17:04.839 --> 17:07.559

17:13.480 --> 17:16.278

17:38.760 --> 17:40.751

17:41.000 --> 17:44.356
He'd try everything. You know how he is.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.591
I ain't never going back there!

17:46.920 --> 17:50.276
You hear what I say? I'd die first Celie.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.995
Don't let them run over you.
Show them who's got the upper hand.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.355
They got it.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.829
You got to fight, Celie. You got to.

18:01.160 --> 18:03.390
I don't know how to fight.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.918
All I know how to do is stay alive.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.190

19:06.760 --> 19:09.479

19:12.680 --> 19:15.069
What would I do if I couldn't talk to you?

19:15.160 --> 19:16.434
We could write.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.240
- Can you read good?
- I can't say that I do.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.630

31:52.520 --> 31:56.195
"...Oliver was the victim
of a systematic course...

31:56.520 --> 31:58.590
"...of treachery and deception."

32:02.520 --> 32:06.752
"The hungry and destitute situation
of the infant orphan..."

32:10.120 --> 32:13.795
Come help me get ready!
Come on! I'll be late!

32:15.080 --> 32:16.832
You hear me call you?

32:19.560 --> 32:21.471
Celie, ain't that good comb...

32:21.640 --> 32:23.312
...with my other brushes?

32:23.560 --> 32:25.232
Ain't that horse saddled?

32:25.400 --> 32:29.313
Yes, sir, Pa. Yes, sir. I's getting to it.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.432
Too much grease.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.071
I don't use this kind of grease!

32:45.800 --> 32:50.112
You gonna make me late!
I'm gonna get you if you make me late!

32:54.440 --> 32:57.477
Where's my other black sock?

33:08.040 --> 33:09.951
Don't forget to iron my shirt.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.875
Where's my black tie?
I mean the yellow one with black in it!

33:14.200 --> 33:15.474
Is in there.

33:15.720 --> 33:17.950
I don't see it! Where's my suit pin?

33:18.280 --> 33:19.395
In the drawer.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.993
Is it on the shelf?

33:22.760 --> 33:25.797
Is it the right side or the left side?

33:26.040 --> 33:27.155
The left.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.749
Is this the right vest for my suit?

33:33.640 --> 33:35.232
Where's my blue...

33:42.920 --> 33:44.831
The black one or the blue one?

33:48.520 --> 33:49.714
The black one.

34:22.639 --> 34:25.791
I hate this tie!
It don't match what I got on!

34:26.120 --> 34:27.599
I had a blue one...

34:29.360 --> 34:30.429
Damn!

35:07.440 --> 35:10.796
She said she write, but she never write.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.000
She said only death
could keep her from me.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.872
Maybe she dead.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.670
Sofia, slow down!

35:30.000 --> 35:32.389
Harpo, I declare, you is slow today!

35:34.640 --> 35:38.792
Dear God, Harpo be in love
with a girl called Sofia.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.350
Now she be a big girl.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.400
Mister say he want to have a look at her.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.950
I seen 'em coming way up the road.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.999
They just be marching, like going to war.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.792
This here is Sofia.

35:58.160 --> 36:01.994
Sofia is a pretty name, huh?
Sofia, Sofia, Sofia!

36:02.480 --> 36:03.993
Us gonna get married.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.629
Looks like you got yourself in trouble.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.592
I ain't in no trouble.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.519
Big, though.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.114
Who the daddy?

36:15.760 --> 36:17.034
Harpo.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.918
How does he know that?

36:19.440 --> 36:22.318
He knows because he the only one!

36:26.160 --> 36:27.752
Get me some lemonade.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.271
Young women no good these days.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.478
Got their legs open
for every Tom, Dick and Harpo.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.158
Don't think I'll let
my boy marry you 'cause...

36:46.440 --> 36:47.998
...you in the family way.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.399
Not cold enough.

36:49.520 --> 36:54.150
He young and limited. Pretty gal like
you could put anything over on him.

36:56.720 --> 37:00.713
Why I need to marry Harpo?
He living here with you.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.759
What food and clothes he get, you buy.

37:04.720 --> 37:09.032
I know your daddy throwed you out.
Ready to live in the street.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.357
No, sir, I ain't living in no streets.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.240
I'm living with my sister and her husband.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.916
I can live with them
the rest of my life if I want.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.596
Don't tell me how to take care
of me and my baby.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.151
I can take care of it myself.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.873
Nice visiting.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.272
You stay right here, Harpo.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.830
When you free,
me and the baby will be waiting.

37:39.920 --> 37:43.435
At least somebody here know
how to treat a visitor.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.751
Harpo, don't you move...

37:47.280 --> 37:49.032
...one step.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.990
Don't make me wait too long.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.069
I won't!

38:04.560 --> 38:05.231
I will!

38:05.320 --> 38:06.275
I do.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.515
I do!

38:07.880 --> 38:08.995
I do.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.598
Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

38:13.680 --> 38:18.310
To love, honor and cherish?
Forsaking all others for him alone...

38:18.640 --> 38:21.837
...you will perform unto him
all duties owed a husband...

38:22.160 --> 38:24.230
...until death shall separate you.

38:24.520 --> 38:25.396
I do!

38:27.440 --> 38:29.510
You may now salute the bride.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.670
Amen!

38:37.520 --> 38:40.398
I's married now! I's a married woman!

39:23.760 --> 39:27.912
I been needing so many curtains,
but I ain't had time.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.316
You children go on home!

39:30.640 --> 39:33.438
Harpo, come on down.
I need you to hold this baby.

39:33.760 --> 39:34.875
I'm busy!

39:34.960 --> 39:37.679
Busy making a racket.
Now come on down here!

39:38.000 --> 39:41.515
Damn, I'll come down
when I'm good and ready!

39:49.040 --> 39:51.759
Child, we're going to get you a little milk.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.958
A little milk for the baby, yes, indeed.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.032
Here. Go to your daddy.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.032
What should I do with it?

39:59.240 --> 40:02.596
Feed her, then fix up the mess you done.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.631
I can smell the rain coming.

40:04.720 --> 40:09.350
Miss Celie, we got ourselves some new
curtains I want to put in the bedroom.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.039
What you looking at?

40:15.120 --> 40:17.190
Is gonna rain on your head!

40:18.160 --> 40:19.593
You ever hit her?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.474
No, sir.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.670
How do you expect her to mind?

40:26.320 --> 40:28.231
Wives is like children.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.113
You have to let them know
who got the upper hand.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.118
Nothing can do it better
than a good beating.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.269
Sofia thinks too much of herself.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.950
Needs to be taken down a peg or two.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.160
Got a new baby and it cry all night long.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.199
Kept him up so he said
he wasn't going to work.

40:53.520 --> 40:56.557
She got all upset but I said,
leave the man alone.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.189
Sometimes a man just needs
to be left alone.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.633
I want some food!

41:00.720 --> 41:03.996
Pie's in the pantry. Women need
to be left alone sometimes, too.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.117
I tell Harpo, when I'm fussing,
"leave me alone!"

41:07.400 --> 41:08.674
Get it for me!

41:08.880 --> 41:10.632
Whas the matter with you?

41:10.800 --> 41:13.030
Thas my own baby crying.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.071
Make yourself useful.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.111
What should I do about Sofia?

41:36.880 --> 41:37.995
Beat her.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.672
You told Harpo to beat me!

41:55.920 --> 41:59.276
It was that mule, Old Joey.
Old Joey, the mule.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.956
I was plowing the north field
and the mule went crazy.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.636
He started kicking.
Busted my eye and my lip.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.520
All my life I had to fight.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.356
I had to fight my daddy,
I had to fight my uncles.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.591
I had to fight my brothers.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.959
Girl child ain't safe in a family of mens.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.317
But I never thought I had
to fight in my own house!

42:24.560 --> 42:26.471
I loves Harpo.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.030
God knows I do.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.356
But I'll kill him dead
before I let him beat me!

42:33.680 --> 42:35.432
Thas a hoof print.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.113
Is a fist print.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.919
No, sir. Ain't no fist touched my face.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.959
You want a dead son-in-law, Miss Celie?

42:43.280 --> 42:45.999
You keep on advising him like you're doing.

42:47.440 --> 42:51.274
This life be over soon.
Heaven lasts always.

42:51.600 --> 42:55.434
You should bash Mister's head open
and think about Heaven later.

43:15.920 --> 43:17.990
Sofia beat on Harpo.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.550
Then Harpo beat on Sofia.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.440
And then, Sofia beat on Harpo some more.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.957
In between the beatings,
the children keep coming.

43:31.920 --> 43:35.879
And then one day,
Sofia can't take it no more.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.992
Good riddance!

44:08.560 --> 44:09.834
Nettie.

44:32.400 --> 44:36.234
I brung you some fresh-baked cookies,
made in my stove!

44:57.200 --> 45:01.352
Have a fine day, Mr. Huntley!
And keep the plate!

45:06.640 --> 45:08.392
Anything come for me?

45:28.400 --> 45:31.756
Dear God, today was a peculiar day.

45:32.880 --> 45:36.077
I was sitting on the porch
reading to the kids...

45:36.400 --> 45:39.119
...when suddenly, something struck me.

45:39.440 --> 45:42.000
I got up and looked at the sky.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.880
It was dark and there
wasn't nothing moving.

45:45.200 --> 45:47.111
I got down off the porch...

45:47.440 --> 45:50.796
...to see what was coming.
It felt like twister weather.

45:51.120 --> 45:54.954
I didn't see nothing.
But I know something's there.

45:55.240 --> 45:58.277
Yes, indeed, Lord.
I know something's coming.

46:27.760 --> 46:30.149
Who that, Pa? Who this?

46:30.480 --> 46:32.072
Pa, who this?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.355
The woman that should have been
your mammy.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.555
Shug Avery?

46:36.840 --> 46:39.559
Give me a hand and get her in the house.

46:40.560 --> 46:43.120
Celie! Help me get her in the house.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.672
Celie! Get here!

47:11.600 --> 47:15.275
This Shug Avery, a friend of the family.
Fix up the spare room.

47:15.600 --> 47:16.874
I can't move.

47:17.360 --> 47:20.238
I can't move! I need to see her eyes.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.916
I feel that once I see her eyes,
my feet can let go...

47:24.240 --> 47:25.958
...of where they're stuck.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.870
You sure is ugly!

47:52.080 --> 47:54.310
Turn loose my goddamn hand!

47:54.640 --> 47:57.359
Whas the matter with you? You crazy?

47:58.160 --> 48:00.720
I don't need no weak little boy...

48:01.040 --> 48:04.237
...can't say no to his daddy, hanging on me!

48:04.720 --> 48:07.439
I need me a man! You hear!

48:08.560 --> 48:09.993
A man!

48:16.720 --> 48:21.350
And I don't want to smell
no goddamn stinking pipe, Albert!

48:25.360 --> 48:28.875
Get that thing to make me
something to eat.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.590
No, I'll make it myself.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.634
Albert?

48:41.040 --> 48:41.916
Shit!

48:47.920 --> 48:51.754
Eggs. Skillet. Why are the pots up here?

48:51.920 --> 48:53.558
Nobody can get to them.

49:06.800 --> 49:09.360
Butter, butter, butter.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.910
Is in the cooler, on the shelf.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.551
Butter? Butter!

49:16.880 --> 49:19.269
In the cooler, on the shelf.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.794
Albert.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.872
How do you work this stove?

49:30.480 --> 49:31.913
Ain't hot enough.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.677
Can't even keep a stove
burning good all day.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.189
She can't even keep her oven hot!

49:41.840 --> 49:43.512
You're useless sometimes!

49:46.320 --> 49:47.912
Wood. Wood.

49:56.880 --> 49:59.110
Did you ever cook on this?

50:03.760 --> 50:05.830
It still ain't hot enough!

50:13.520 --> 50:17.354
I'll get it hot.
I'll show you how to make it... hot.

50:51.280 --> 50:54.317
Baby, look what I brought you.

50:57.680 --> 51:01.355
Have I got a surprise for you.
This'll make you all well.

51:01.760 --> 51:04.911
This looks burnt, but the eggs
are the way you like them.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.270
Are you trying to kill me?

51:08.080 --> 51:09.991
Now, baby, don't be that way!

52:03.120 --> 52:05.680
I told you, I don't want nothing!

52:08.720 --> 52:12.713
I just stand back, and wait to see
what the wall will look like.

52:13.040 --> 52:16.396
See what kind of colors
Shug'll put on there now.

52:37.520 --> 52:41.832
What you staring at?
Never seen a naked woman before?

52:42.480 --> 52:44.391
You got any children?

52:44.760 --> 52:46.034
Yes, ma'am.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.391
"Yes, ma'am"? I ain't that old.

52:49.840 --> 52:50.795
Two.

52:51.440 --> 52:52.714
Where they at?

52:53.520 --> 52:54.794
I don't know.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.514
Who are you?

52:58.800 --> 53:00.233
Celie, ma'am.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.592
You ain't well.

53:16.080 --> 53:19.914
Mind your own business. I feel fine.
Just had to eat.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.118
Now, put some more bubbling oil
in this tub.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.792
You got kids?

53:31.440 --> 53:32.714
Yeah.

53:34.640 --> 53:36.710
They with my ma and pa.

53:37.200 --> 53:41.716
Never knowed a child to come out right
unless there's a man around.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.794
Children...

53:47.440 --> 53:49.510
...got to have a pa.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.792
Your pa love you?

53:57.680 --> 53:59.432
My pa loved me.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.471
My pa still loves me...

54:02.840 --> 54:04.558
...except he don't know it.

54:06.640 --> 54:07.993
He don't know it.

54:47.920 --> 54:50.309
Hey, boy! Here, boy!

54:50.720 --> 54:52.597
Nobody here to greet your pa?

54:54.480 --> 54:56.869
Sure ain't nobody in the fields.

55:35.760 --> 55:39.594
Just couldn't rest till you got her
in your house, could you?

55:42.640 --> 55:43.755
Cool drink?

55:44.880 --> 55:46.313
Take your hat?

55:56.240 --> 55:59.118
What is it with this Shug Avery?

56:00.080 --> 56:01.991
She black as tar...

56:02.480 --> 56:03.913
...nappy-headed...

56:05.360 --> 56:07.920
She got legs like baseball bats.

56:08.400 --> 56:11.597
Her own daddy won't have
nothing to do with her.

56:12.080 --> 56:14.640
Old Mister talking trash about Shug.

56:14.840 --> 56:17.752
Folks don't like nobody
being too proud or too free.

56:17.840 --> 56:20.877
She's no more than a jook-joint Jezebel.

56:22.160 --> 56:24.071
She ain't even clean.

56:24.400 --> 56:28.234
I hear she's got
that nasty women's disease.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.559
You ain't got it in you to understand.

56:33.520 --> 56:35.272
I love Shug Avery.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.990
Always have, always will.

56:38.320 --> 56:41.039
Shoulďve married her when I had a chance.

56:42.160 --> 56:46.790
And throwed your life away. And a right
smart amount of my money with it.

56:50.520 --> 56:53.876
I hear all her children's
got different daddies.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.998
Is all too trifling and confused.

56:58.800 --> 57:02.315
All Shug's children got the same daddy.
I can vouch...

57:02.520 --> 57:04.238
You can vouch for nothing!

57:05.520 --> 57:09.991
Shug Avery done set the population
of Hartwell County a new high.

57:12.240 --> 57:14.959
You just one of the roosters, boy.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.351
You has my sympathy.

57:26.640 --> 57:31.270
Ain't many women's allow their
husbanďs whore to lay up in their house.

57:34.520 --> 57:36.238
Hand Pa his hat.

58:26.960 --> 58:30.794
Next time, I'll put a little Shug Avery pee
in his glass...

58:31.040 --> 58:32.871
...and see how he like that.

58:49.360 --> 58:52.875
I ain't heard so much racket
since before Sofia left.

58:53.280 --> 58:55.669
Every evening after he leave the field...

58:56.040 --> 58:59.350
...he knocking down and piling things up.

58:59.600 --> 59:02.160
Sometime his friend, Swain,
come by to help.

59:09.720 --> 59:10.835
Harpo!

59:14.880 --> 59:17.440
Two of them worked long way past supper.

59:17.760 --> 59:21.116
Mister have to call and tell them
to shut up the racket.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.272
What you doing?

59:25.600 --> 59:27.158
Building a jook joint!

59:27.360 --> 59:28.793
Way back here?

59:29.640 --> 59:32.393
Jook joins supposed to
be way back in the woods.

59:40.640 --> 59:42.551
You never seen this before.

59:44.640 --> 59:46.312
I know what a cow looks like.

59:46.400 --> 59:48.630
You ain't never seen a cow like this.

59:54.760 --> 59:56.830
Ready... one... two... three!

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.390
Welcome to Harpo's! I'm Harpo.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.550
Girl, I'd drink your bath water!

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.869
Oh, sugar dumpling, let me taste some!

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.159
You can catch a fish without a hook, girl.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.759
Looks like Albert brought his maid.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.914
Last time I saw that kind of hat
was at my mama's funeral.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.598
There are only two kinds of children
in this world...

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.990
...Goďs children and Satan's!

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.880
Babylon ain't no far-off place in the desert.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.510
Is right here! Just a few
hundred yards from this holy place.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.075
The song I'm about to sing...

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.918
...is called "Miss Celie's Blues."

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.397
Because she scratched it out
of my head when I was ailing.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.632
"Sister

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.714
"You've been on my mind

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.231
"Oh, Sister

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.791
"We're two of a kind

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.395
"So, Sister

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.517
"I'm keeping my eye on you

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.315
"I bet you think I don't know nothing

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.069
"But singing the blues

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.471
"Oh, Sister

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.190
"Have I got news for you

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.755
"I'm something

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.394
"I hope you think
that you're something, too

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.790
"Oh, scuffling

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.478
"I been up that lonesome road

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.310
"And I seen a lot of suns going down

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.990
"Oh, but, trust me

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.749
"No low-life's going to run me around

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.830
"So let me tell you something, Sister

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.390
"Remember your name

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.271
"No twister

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.830
"Going to steal your stuff away

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.470
"My sister

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.989
"We sure ain't got a whole lot of time

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.830
"So shake your shimmy

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.118
"Sister

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.749
"Because, honey, this Shug is feeling

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.952
"Fine"

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.837
I used to live here.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.832
This used to be my living room.
That was my kitchen.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.794
Harpo run the doors and
windows from the creek to here.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.950
Now, somewhere is my dining room.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.797
Look at who's here. Is Miss Celie.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.637
Miss Celie, it sure is good to see you.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.280
Pull up a chair. Have a cold drink.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.600
I believes I want me some of this here.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.074
I want to introduce y'all to my friend.
Henry Broadnax is his name.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:55.756
Everybody call him Buster.
He's a good friend of the family.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.991
How you doing? How you feel?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.517
- Where are your children?
- At home. Where are yours?

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.639
What you doing here?

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.753
I came to hear Miss Shug sing and
to see what a nice place you built.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.436
This is scandalous!
A woman with children in a jook joint!

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.638
A woman need to have a little fun, Harpo.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.712
A woman need to be at home.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.236
I don't fight my woman's battles.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:35.438
My job is to love her and take her
where she want to go. Right?

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.194
Les dance.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.916
First time I ever been knocked out
without a punch.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.073
Be nice now.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.913
Be nice now.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.632
Who this woman?

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.473
You know who this is.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.312
She best leave you alone.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.834
Fine with me.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.229
You ain't going nowhere.
This is my jook joint.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.151
You said is our jook joint!

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.629
Can't a man dance with his wife?

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.712
Not if she left him.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.309
Good night.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.953
And not if he my man.
You just a big old heifer!

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.632
Like I said, fine with me.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.273
Time to go.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.314
Oh, shit!

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.715
This is my place!

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.591
Get off my boy!

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.558
What about me?

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.872
Come on, I don't want to come in after you.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:38.794
Lord have mercy! Firemen ain't
gonna get it, somebody call the law!

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.270
You can light a fire without a match.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:45.194
You can catch a fish without a hook.
You can make a blind man see.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.798
Now do your shimmy.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.358
Shake your shimmy, girl!
Come on! Show me your stuff!

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.637
Miss Celie, why you always
covering up your smile?

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.312
Show me some teeth.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.870
Show me that pretty smile.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.671
Oh, girl, you need...

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.911
...a smiling lesson.

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.755
"Made him stout. Wasn't satisfied
till he made him a snout.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.310
"Made him a snout as long as a rail.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.633
"Wasn't satisfied till he made him a tail.
Made him a tail..."

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.037
You see, Miss Celie,
you gots a beautiful smile.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:03.432
Well, Miss Celie, I do believe
is time for me to go.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.031
September. Yeah, September be a
good time to go off in the world.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.512
Whas the matter?

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.430
He beat me when you ain't here.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.189
Who do?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.034
Albert?

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.755
Mister.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.712
Why he do that?

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.800
He beat me for not being you.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.031
I know he a bully...

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.517
...but there's some things I love about him.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.752
You still love him?

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.310
I got what you call a passion for him.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.793
If I was ever going to have a husband,
he'd been it. But he weak.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.872
Tell me the truth.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.749
Do you mind if Albert sleep with me?

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:33.832
You like sleeping with him?

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.914
I have to confess, I love it. Don't you?

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.638
No, most time I pretend I ain't even there.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.837
He don't know the difference.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.600
He don't never ask me how I feel.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.990
He never ask me about myself.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.039
He just climb on top of me
and do his business.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.590
"Do his business"?

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.512
You sound like...

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.718
...he going to the toilet on you.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.430
Thas what it feel like.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.232
Then, Miss Celie...

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.910
...that mean you still a virgin.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.675
- Yeah, because don't nobody love me.
- I love you.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.560
- You think I's ugly.
- No, I don't.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.077
"You ugly. You sure is ugly."

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.837
"You still ugly."

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.792
Amen.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.595
Oh, Miss Celie, that was just
the salt in the sugar.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.480
Me being jealous of you and Albert.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.870
I think you beautiful.
