00:32.534 --> 00:34.905
All right.

00:36.419 --> 00:38.288
Very nice, E.J.

00:38.313 --> 00:40.904
You shaved 0.7 seconds off that run.

00:40.905 --> 00:44.194
We'll need to up the negative
camber another... degree.

00:44.195 --> 00:45.260
That's exciting.

00:46.325 --> 00:48.534
You wanted me to remind
you when it was time to go.

00:48.535 --> 00:50.614
Thanks, E.J.

00:50.615 --> 00:51.654
Anytime, man.

00:51.655 --> 00:53.155
I still have to load your upgrade.

01:00.235 --> 01:01.654
What's wrong with your wipers?

01:01.655 --> 01:03.534
Low moisture sensitivity.

01:03.535 --> 01:05.110
They were coming on
too late when it rained.

01:05.134 --> 01:06.774
I got a game to catch.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.493
Come on.

01:10.518 --> 01:12.074
Screw this, I got to go.

01:18.905 --> 01:20.535
Really?

01:30.275 --> 01:32.654
I don't have time for
this crap, E.J. Whoa!

01:32.655 --> 01:34.368
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:37.790 --> 01:40.663
CEO of Ejetto
Technologies, Ginny Bretton...

01:40.688 --> 01:41.614
E.J. kills.

01:41.615 --> 01:43.325
My name's E.J.

01:43.326 --> 01:44.614
Technology on trial...

01:44.615 --> 01:46.114
How are you? My name's E.J.

01:46.115 --> 01:47.864
My name's E.J. My name's E.J.

01:47.865 --> 01:49.824
Would you like me to
stop for some coffee?

01:49.825 --> 01:53.194
Ejetto Technologies
was founded by tech entrepreneur

01:53.195 --> 01:54.654
Ginny Bretton.

01:54.655 --> 01:56.234
Say her name fast and
it rhymes with Einstein.

01:56.235 --> 01:57.364
I don't think

01:57.365 --> 01:58.734
Einstein would've devoted his life

01:58.735 --> 01:59.766
to autonomous vehicles.

01:59.791 --> 02:01.944
Benny, do I detect a
hint of technophobia?

02:01.945 --> 02:04.730
Just work better with paper and pen.

02:04.755 --> 02:06.489
And by pen, I mean my Montblanc.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.762
Technophobe.

02:07.787 --> 02:09.279
So, what do we think of this case?

02:09.280 --> 02:11.029
It's a loser.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.909
The plaintiff is Adam's widow,
married less than a year,

02:13.910 --> 02:15.869
also an employee at Ejetto.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.699
All they have to prove
is that it was negligence

02:17.700 --> 02:19.159
that caused the death.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.989
Much as I hate to agree,

02:20.990 --> 02:22.609
juries get lost in technobabble,

02:22.610 --> 02:25.319
so they're likely to find for
a young widow over big tech.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.909
But this case has a
young woman behind it,

02:27.910 --> 02:30.109
and Ginny has accomplished
more in her first 26 years

02:30.110 --> 02:32.280
than most do in an entire lifetime.

02:32.283 --> 02:34.029
Who knows what she's gonna do

02:34.054 --> 02:35.123
in the next 26?

02:35.124 --> 02:37.529
You really think she's going
to make that big of an impact?

02:37.530 --> 02:39.199
I do. Just got a text.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.199
She sent a car.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.841
Least I can do is hear her out.

02:53.512 --> 02:55.779
Hi, Dr. Bull.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.200
Please come in.

02:59.976 --> 03:02.085
My name is E.J.

03:02.110 --> 03:03.109
How are you?

03:03.110 --> 03:04.529
In case you're programmed to care,

03:04.530 --> 03:07.852
E.J., I'm fine, thanks for asking.

03:07.877 --> 03:09.489
Are you comfortable with me driving?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.962
Well, "comfortable" might
be a bit strong.

03:11.987 --> 03:14.485
I take it you're the self-driving
program that Ginny is

03:14.510 --> 03:15.529
getting ready to launch?

03:15.530 --> 03:16.659
I am.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.569
Were you driving the
car that was involved

03:18.570 --> 03:20.239
in the fatal crash?

03:20.240 --> 03:22.239
Unfortunately, yes.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.779
But don't worry, I've been updated.

03:23.780 --> 03:25.449
What went wrong?

03:25.450 --> 03:27.569
Unfortunately, I don't remember.

03:27.570 --> 03:28.569
That's convenient.

03:28.570 --> 03:30.569
Good thing Ginny contacted me.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.966
Yes. You have a very
impressive success rate:

03:32.991 --> 03:34.700
91.5%.

03:34.725 --> 03:36.409
Actually, it's a bit higher than that.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.029
Currently it is,

03:38.030 --> 03:40.409
but Ginny also asked me to
factor in this case, as well.

03:40.410 --> 03:41.909
I projected a loss.

03:51.171 --> 03:52.974
All right, Dr. Bull.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.069
You have arrived at
Ginny Bretton's house.

03:55.070 --> 03:56.069
Front door's open.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.159
I'll wait here for you.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.160
Thank you.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.160
Hello?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.320
Hello?

04:19.370 --> 04:20.738
Ms. Bretton?

04:20.740 --> 04:22.369
Yeah, I'm back here.

04:22.370 --> 04:23.990
Hey.

04:25.558 --> 04:26.718
Want a fry?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.369
Sorry, I'm Ginny.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.909
I'd shake your hand, but, um...

04:32.910 --> 04:34.199
burger fingers.

04:35.785 --> 04:37.494
So, is it Dr. Bull?

04:37.519 --> 04:38.768
Or Jason? Or...

04:38.793 --> 04:39.988
Just Bull.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.278
Well, hey, thanks for coming.

04:41.279 --> 04:42.988
Let's...

04:42.989 --> 04:44.658
Where to start?

04:44.659 --> 04:45.988
First,

04:45.989 --> 04:48.159
have a seat.

04:51.609 --> 04:52.609
Interesting office.

04:52.610 --> 04:53.608
My parents surrendered

04:53.609 --> 04:55.488
this room to me when I was 12, so...

04:55.489 --> 04:56.528
Your parents live here?

04:56.529 --> 04:58.068
They did, yeah.

04:58.069 --> 05:00.358
I bought them a house in
Scottsdale, traded it for this.

05:00.359 --> 05:02.568
This is where I get all my best ideas.

05:02.569 --> 05:06.158
So, personal desalinization pods,

05:06.159 --> 05:08.158
self-generating solar batteries.

05:08.159 --> 05:11.099
Um, the Arable Gobi. I love this one.

05:11.124 --> 05:13.698
It's, um, turning the
Gobi Desert into farmland.

05:13.699 --> 05:15.198
Are all these realistic?

05:15.199 --> 05:16.818
Yeah, all of them.

05:16.819 --> 05:20.318
I've just been, too
busy working on E.J.

05:23.859 --> 05:25.658
Adam was such a nice guy.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.488
I feel terrible for
Adam's wife, Erica, too.

05:28.489 --> 05:31.028
Erica said Adam died because
your program malfunctioned.

05:31.029 --> 05:33.198
Yeah, and I've spent every minute

05:33.199 --> 05:35.068
since he died scanning E.J.,

05:35.069 --> 05:37.488
but there's no glitch, no error, nothing.

05:37.489 --> 05:38.488
Wasn't his fault.

05:38.489 --> 05:39.608
His?

05:39.609 --> 05:40.898
Yeah, E.J.'s.

05:40.899 --> 05:42.460
When you give something a face,

05:42.485 --> 05:44.374
it's hard not to anthropomorphize it.

05:46.159 --> 05:47.818
So you think it was Adam's fault.

05:47.819 --> 05:48.914
It had to be.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.553
He entered those updates

05:50.578 --> 05:51.948
every day with a thumb drive,

05:51.949 --> 05:53.799
but the day that he died,
he made a mistake.

05:53.824 --> 05:55.858
He bypassed security protocols,

05:55.859 --> 05:59.318
you know, prematurely shut
down and overloaded the system.

05:59.319 --> 06:00.346
That's what killed him?

06:00.371 --> 06:02.791
Once you have corrupted files,
anything can happen.

06:02.816 --> 06:05.608
E.J. was designed to save lives,
not to take them.

06:05.609 --> 06:07.238
So, 33,000 Americans die

06:07.239 --> 06:08.628
in car accidents every year,

06:08.653 --> 06:10.198
but if every car had an E.J.,

06:10.199 --> 06:12.238
we could reduce that number by 90%.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.198
Okay, that's 30,000 lives,

06:14.199 --> 06:15.398
every year.

06:15.399 --> 06:17.198
That's a lot of lives.

06:17.199 --> 06:18.198
Yes, it is.

06:18.199 --> 06:20.398
So, what's his speech based on?

06:20.399 --> 06:23.738
I noticed he said "unfortunately" twice.

06:23.739 --> 06:26.238
You coded him to use very human idioms.

06:26.239 --> 06:28.738
Yeah.

06:28.739 --> 06:31.738
I had a friend who used
to say that all the time,

06:31.739 --> 06:32.948
about everything.

06:32.949 --> 06:33.948
"Unfortunately."

06:33.949 --> 06:35.109
"Used to"?

06:36.159 --> 06:38.359
Yeah.

06:41.199 --> 06:44.448
You know, I have a PhD,
three disciplines,

06:44.449 --> 06:46.028
in psychology if you need any help

06:46.029 --> 06:47.108
with E.J.'s personality.

06:47.109 --> 06:50.198
Thanks, but,
I like him the way he is.

06:50.199 --> 06:51.528
Why don't you settle?

06:51.529 --> 06:53.028
I tried.

06:53.029 --> 06:55.448
You know, I've offered Erica
whatever she wanted, but...

06:55.449 --> 06:58.109
this isn't about money for either of us.

07:00.109 --> 07:01.609
She wants revenge.

07:03.859 --> 07:05.858
She wants to kill E.J.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.799
Even if her employee screwed up,

07:13.824 --> 07:15.874
why weren't there adequate
fail-safes in place?

07:15.899 --> 07:18.948
Ejetto is a tech company.
Safety should be job one.

07:18.949 --> 07:21.358
It's gonna come down to Ginny's
credibility as an inventor.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.528
They'll try and paint
her as a money-grubbing,

07:23.529 --> 07:25.821
heartless tech-head who doesn't
care about her employees.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.698
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

07:27.699 --> 07:28.743
She's a marshmallow.

07:28.768 --> 07:31.358
She's also loopy...
Half-finished sentence

07:31.359 --> 07:33.278
next to a half-eaten
bowl of Count Chocula.

07:34.199 --> 07:35.858
So, I'm thinking we'll lose the pajamas.

07:35.859 --> 07:37.358
Yeah, that's a good idea because

07:37.359 --> 07:39.358
a little loopy is nice, it's endearing.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.528
Takes the edge off the CEO stereotype.

07:42.529 --> 07:46.158
But too loopy looks incompetent,
likely to make mistakes.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.358
Okay, so we'll find the sweet
spot on the loopiness spectrum.

07:48.359 --> 07:49.778
It's a copy of the thumb drive

07:49.779 --> 07:51.778
that the paramedics
found near Adam's body.

07:51.779 --> 07:54.158
Have Cable go through that,
find Adam's mistakes.

07:54.159 --> 07:57.028
We also need proof he
bypassed security protocols.

07:57.029 --> 07:59.698
I thought Ginny already
confirmed that he did.

07:59.699 --> 08:02.278
People, say it with me.

08:02.279 --> 08:05.238
Never trust the client.

08:05.239 --> 08:06.238
That's my team.

08:06.239 --> 08:07.319
Now I'm proud of you.

08:07.344 --> 08:09.488
Danny, we're gonna go
to Ejetto, we've got to get

08:09.489 --> 08:11.278
our hands on Adam's personnel file

08:11.279 --> 08:13.989
and find out what kind
of employee he was.

08:14.818 --> 08:16.147
Yeah, I'm just the money guy.

08:16.172 --> 08:17.488
That's why Ginny brought me in.

08:17.489 --> 08:19.198
She makes the magic, I make the payroll.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.818
You get along with her?

08:20.819 --> 08:22.069
Are you kidding?

08:22.094 --> 08:24.358
Ginny's like a daughter to me,
in more ways than one.

08:24.359 --> 08:26.943
I mean, I feel like a father
to most of these kids.

08:26.968 --> 08:27.948
Right, Carter?

08:27.973 --> 08:29.238
That's right, Dad.

08:29.239 --> 08:30.898
Course, you know,

08:30.899 --> 08:32.607
soon they'll all be billionaires
and they'll be moving off

08:32.609 --> 08:34.240
to start their own little tech families.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.265
When did you come on board?

08:35.289 --> 08:36.528
Eighth grade.

08:36.553 --> 08:38.892
Ginny beat me out for
middle school valedictorian.

08:38.917 --> 08:41.126
Not that I'm still bitter
about that or anything.

08:41.126 --> 08:42.456
Wait a second.

08:42.457 --> 08:44.956
You started working on
E.J. in the eighth grade?

08:44.957 --> 08:46.996
No, no, no, first we built a robotic arm,

08:46.997 --> 08:48.956
firefighting drone, a digital cornea

08:48.957 --> 08:50.746
and a few others that
aren't worth mentioning.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.956
Then Ginny was involved in a car accident

08:52.957 --> 08:54.746
and next thing you know, E.J. came along.

08:54.747 --> 08:56.126
Tell us about Adam.

08:56.127 --> 08:57.076
Was a great guy.

08:57.077 --> 08:58.336
Poor Erica, we loved her here.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.286
She's one of our best R&D engineers.

09:00.287 --> 09:02.836
Nice enough guy, but he had his issues.

09:02.837 --> 09:05.706
Showing up late, missing some
days, falling asleep on the job.

09:05.707 --> 09:07.166
This wasn't his first mistake.

09:07.167 --> 09:10.036
It's all in the file.

09:10.037 --> 09:12.206
So, you think the accident was his fault?

09:12.207 --> 09:13.496
Hell yeah.

09:13.497 --> 09:15.036
It's obviously in
our interest to think so,

09:15.037 --> 09:18.036
but the truth is he did
violate security protocols.

09:18.037 --> 09:20.246
You know when you're supposed
to click eject before removing?

09:20.247 --> 09:22.036
Well, we have several things
that you're supposed to log

09:22.037 --> 09:23.166
before removing the drive.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.666
He didn't stick to the script.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.746
Incident report's in there, too.

09:26.747 --> 09:28.286
Should've fired him a long time ago.

09:28.287 --> 09:32.036
Maybe. But Ginny thinks of
everyone here as family members.

09:32.037 --> 09:33.722
All right, you don't mind if
we take a look around, do you?

09:33.746 --> 09:35.386
- Sure, take your time.
- Thank you, guys.

09:36.957 --> 09:38.706
All right, see what you can find.

09:38.707 --> 09:40.167
Keep an eye on Carter.

09:42.077 --> 09:44.016
He's not telling us everything.

09:57.797 --> 10:00.336
It's a digital record from
the night of the accident.

10:00.337 --> 10:03.706
Adam definitely screwed up in
failing to log the drive out,

10:03.707 --> 10:04.706
but watch this.

10:04.707 --> 10:05.876
He overloaded the system.

10:05.877 --> 10:07.296
So why was he in such a hurry?

10:07.297 --> 10:08.456
I checked his calendar.

10:08.457 --> 10:09.496
A soccer match.

10:09.497 --> 10:11.617
He was in a hurry
to get home and watch a game.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.301
At 1:30 in the morning?

10:13.326 --> 10:15.456
You've obviously never seen
an Arsenal, Man. U. Match.

10:15.457 --> 10:16.996
There's our human error.

10:16.997 --> 10:18.046
Ginny's home free.

10:18.047 --> 10:20.756
Except...

10:20.757 --> 10:21.796
the green thumb drive

10:21.797 --> 10:23.456
is still a bit of a mystery.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.956
I dug deeper and found
something I didn't recognize:

10:25.957 --> 10:27.456
A bunch of junk code lines.

10:27.457 --> 10:28.996
I'll try to decipher what I can,

10:28.997 --> 10:30.586
but it's like eating a bowl of soup

10:30.587 --> 10:32.046
with a fork.

10:32.047 --> 10:33.167
Get slurping.

10:34.423 --> 10:36.703
Well, we have our
first person of interest.

10:36.728 --> 10:38.664
Your suspicions were right, Bull.

10:38.689 --> 10:40.296
Carter's a recovering addict.

10:40.297 --> 10:41.796
He was in rehab last year.

10:41.797 --> 10:43.376
You want to ask him about that?

10:43.377 --> 10:45.046
I'd rather ask our client.

10:45.047 --> 10:47.586
He was in a mountain biking
accident five years ago,

10:47.587 --> 10:49.916
he messed up a nerve in his neck.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.126
Started out with prescription pain pills

10:52.127 --> 10:53.756
and went downhill from there.

10:53.757 --> 10:55.916
He ever come back uphill?

10:55.917 --> 10:58.496
He says that he's clean,

10:58.497 --> 10:59.916
but his money's going somewhere.

10:59.917 --> 11:02.416
I mean, he's always hitting
me and Dean up for a float.

11:02.417 --> 11:04.496
I mean, he's desperate for money,

11:04.497 --> 11:06.706
could be an extortion plot gone wrong.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.996
No. I mean, Carter's
got his personal problems,

11:08.997 --> 11:10.996
but he and I built this company

11:11.021 --> 11:12.626
from nothing, he wouldn't jeopardize it.

11:12.627 --> 11:16.706
Plus, I pulled his security
clearance on E.J. a year ago.

11:16.707 --> 11:17.706
How'd he take that?

11:17.707 --> 11:20.256
With bitterness and sarcasm.

11:20.257 --> 11:21.496
Bottom line,

11:21.497 --> 11:22.956
he couldn't access E.J.'s program

11:22.957 --> 11:24.444
even if he wanted to.

11:27.497 --> 11:29.296
When the Titanic sank,

11:29.297 --> 11:30.916
whose fault was it,

11:30.917 --> 11:33.046
the ship's or the captain's?

11:33.047 --> 11:34.916
And this helps us how?

11:34.917 --> 11:37.876
Walking tech disasters screw
up tech ten times a day.

11:37.877 --> 11:40.586
They accept human
error as a fact of life.

11:40.587 --> 11:42.756
They'll blame the
captain before the ship,

11:42.757 --> 11:44.086
Adam before E.J.

11:44.087 --> 11:45.916
The ship had serious design flaws.

11:45.917 --> 11:47.416
You can't blame the captain.

11:47.417 --> 11:48.876
They told him it was unsinkable.

11:48.877 --> 11:50.296
Middle-school science teacher.

11:50.297 --> 11:51.496
ScoreMyTeacher.com

11:51.497 --> 11:53.565
says he's a hawk
when it comes to grading,

11:53.590 --> 11:55.586
never gives anything over a "B."

11:55.587 --> 11:57.956
Well, we don't
want him to flunk E.J.

11:59.837 --> 12:00.956
Move to strike, Your Honor.

12:00.957 --> 12:02.996
Juror number one, you're dismissed.

12:02.997 --> 12:04.756
Next up is Stella... artist,

12:04.757 --> 12:06.376
lives off the grid. Now, this is where

12:06.377 --> 12:07.996
tech disasters get tricky.

12:07.997 --> 12:10.046
No social media profiles,

12:10.047 --> 12:10.956
not even e-mail.

12:10.957 --> 12:11.956
I like the look.

12:11.957 --> 12:13.086
Old school.

12:13.087 --> 12:14.836
I can smell the patchouli from here.

12:14.837 --> 12:16.086
We accessed

12:16.087 --> 12:18.256
postal archives, she exchanges letters

12:18.257 --> 12:19.956
with a transcendental guru,

12:19.957 --> 12:21.706
signs her name as her spirit animal.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.336
I can't imagine trying to guide

12:24.337 --> 12:26.546
a ship that size a hundred years ago.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.207
The captain was only human.

12:34.547 --> 12:36.126
The captain was negligent,

12:36.127 --> 12:37.706
and the ship was poorly engineered.

12:37.707 --> 12:40.996
If I had to blame one thing,
it'd be the iceberg.

12:40.997 --> 12:42.876
There's an
outside-the-box thinker.

12:42.877 --> 12:45.086
He's a wild card,
but at least his instinct

12:45.087 --> 12:46.206
isn't to blame Ginny.

12:46.207 --> 12:47.207
Let's take him.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.086
That look of

12:53.087 --> 12:55.336
quiet desperation means
you couldn't decrypt it.

12:55.337 --> 12:57.706
But this look of excitement...

12:57.707 --> 12:59.256
says I found someone who can.

12:59.257 --> 13:02.046
An encryption specialist named Sarcoma.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.706
How come hackers never have
names like Parasol or Julep?

13:05.731 --> 13:08.383
Well, hackers tend to pick names
that reflect their personality.

13:08.408 --> 13:10.126
This one's cancer.

13:10.127 --> 13:11.796
He won't meet with me,

13:11.797 --> 13:15.756
but I happen to know that he's
dying to meet Goliath 918,

13:15.757 --> 13:17.756
a notoriously reclusive hacktivist.

13:17.757 --> 13:20.956
Rumor is that he
anonymously shows at events,

13:20.957 --> 13:23.296
so I was wondering if you could,

13:23.297 --> 13:25.456
pose as him at this get-together later.

13:25.457 --> 13:27.496
As Goliath 918.

13:27.497 --> 13:28.756
Well, no one knows

13:28.757 --> 13:30.996
what he looks like,
other than that he's...

13:30.997 --> 13:32.296
vintage.

13:33.297 --> 13:36.456
Sorry. But, with a little makeover,

13:36.457 --> 13:38.127
you could totally pull it off.

13:45.877 --> 13:47.377
Chunk, I got a job for you.

14:03.127 --> 14:04.796
Wow.

14:04.797 --> 14:06.417
Amazing transformation.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.985
If no one's ever seen this guy,

14:11.010 --> 14:12.836
how do they know he
doesn't dress like this?

14:12.837 --> 14:14.376
Remember our little refresher.

14:14.377 --> 14:17.666
If you forget what to say,
just throw out some hacker slang,

14:17.667 --> 14:19.336
like "yak shaving" or "dogfooding."

14:20.737 --> 14:22.656
Whoa.

14:22.681 --> 14:24.721
I think that's him.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.416
Let's go shave that yak.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.547
Okay.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.167
Sarcoma?

14:36.257 --> 14:37.416
Hey.

14:37.417 --> 14:38.757
I'm-I'm Cable.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.836
And this is.

14:43.837 --> 14:45.457
Goliath 918.

14:49.457 --> 14:51.127
You're not Goliath.

15:09.377 --> 15:10.797
Ooh.

15:12.997 --> 15:15.337
Did you see that?

15:18.580 --> 15:20.586
Goliath, it's an honor.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.797
Don't touch me.

15:23.877 --> 15:25.756
You're not Sarcoma.

15:25.757 --> 15:27.876
I swear to God I am.

15:27.877 --> 15:30.707
Junk code, two minutes.

15:37.877 --> 15:40.416
Speak.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.836
I followed Carter home,

15:41.837 --> 15:44.046
and there's something
you got to see. Um...

15:44.047 --> 15:45.496
I'm sending it over to Cable right now.

15:45.497 --> 15:46.582
My God.

15:47.667 --> 15:50.586
He did it, in less than two minutes.

15:50.587 --> 15:51.837
Unbelievable.

15:54.627 --> 15:56.960
So, we cool?

15:56.985 --> 15:59.546
It's just that I...

15:59.547 --> 16:01.337
I don't like to be touched.

16:03.207 --> 16:05.876
Thanks.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.296
What was with the smashing?

16:07.297 --> 16:09.126
How did you know
that that would sell him?

16:09.127 --> 16:11.337
I needed a personality
that matched the name.

16:14.127 --> 16:15.376
What's on this?

16:15.377 --> 16:18.086
So, Sarcoma decrypted about 300 pages

16:18.087 --> 16:19.456
of real code embedded in the junk.

16:19.457 --> 16:20.796
Not sure what it is yet,

16:20.797 --> 16:22.296
but it's not junk.

16:22.297 --> 16:24.206
Hold on.

16:24.207 --> 16:26.047
We're getting live feed from Danny.

16:27.167 --> 16:29.256
Ginny's at Carter's house?

16:29.257 --> 16:30.296
Yeah. I got sound.

16:30.297 --> 16:32.337
Hold on.

16:33.998 --> 16:36.907
What the hell have you done to us?

16:36.932 --> 16:38.756
She swore Carter was innocent.

16:38.757 --> 16:39.756
I told you,

16:39.781 --> 16:41.823
never trust the client.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.006
Where were you yesterday?

17:02.007 --> 17:03.676
Home.

17:03.677 --> 17:05.420
Went to bed early, at 10:00.

17:10.873 --> 17:13.742
In the past seven words,

17:13.742 --> 17:15.492
you exhibited two of
the three most common

17:15.492 --> 17:18.702
you blinked
twice the national average,

17:18.703 --> 17:20.821
and you pointed your
feet towards the exit.

17:20.823 --> 17:22.031
When we fib,

17:22.032 --> 17:23.912
we subconsciously get
ready to leave the room,

17:23.913 --> 17:25.112
in case we're caught.

17:25.113 --> 17:27.531
We know you were with
Carter yesterday. Why?

17:27.532 --> 17:29.162
Wait, you had me followed?

17:29.163 --> 17:30.952
No, we had Carter followed.

17:30.953 --> 17:32.322
You were a surprise bonus.

17:32.323 --> 17:33.662
Carter and I are old friends.

17:33.663 --> 17:35.743
What we talked about had
nothing to do with the case.

17:36.613 --> 17:37.782
It's private.

17:37.783 --> 17:39.073
Okay.

17:41.613 --> 17:43.872
Am I really that bad a liar?

17:43.873 --> 17:46.912
Let's just say it makes your
hair your second-worst trait.

17:48.703 --> 17:51.702
I guess fashion and tech
are mutually exclusive?

17:51.703 --> 17:52.822
Not at all.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.992
In fashion, social tech is everything.

17:54.993 --> 17:57.532
Our profiles, our posts, our images...

17:57.533 --> 17:58.572
They create our brand.

17:58.573 --> 17:59.872
Not to mention the dating apps

17:59.873 --> 18:01.112
that govern modern love.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.282
Tech meets man's greatest needs.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.822
Some people find love through tech,

18:06.823 --> 18:09.073
others find tech through love.

18:11.283 --> 18:13.662
It's a long story.

18:13.663 --> 18:16.492
Well, we have a lot of problems,

18:16.493 --> 18:18.452
and a lack of time ain't one.

18:19.453 --> 18:20.873
So spill it.

18:22.453 --> 18:24.572
Adam was diagnosed
with sleep apnea

18:24.573 --> 18:26.992
two years before he
started working at Ejetto.

18:26.993 --> 18:30.032
So the plaintiffs can't
say that Adam's insomnia

18:30.033 --> 18:32.383
and inattention to
detail were work related.

18:33.283 --> 18:35.742
Benny, tell Danny to take a closer look

18:35.743 --> 18:36.992
at our young widow.

18:36.993 --> 18:39.952
Before we go to court to defend Ginny,

18:39.953 --> 18:42.218
we need to find out why
she's lying about Carter.

18:42.243 --> 18:45.112
Let's talk to an employee who won't lie.

18:45.113 --> 18:46.113
Who's that?

18:48.953 --> 18:51.112
What can you tell us
about Carter Spinell?

18:51.113 --> 18:53.702
He was born 26 years ago, on March 21,

18:53.703 --> 18:54.952
in Hempstead, New York.

18:54.953 --> 18:55.952
Okay.

18:55.953 --> 18:58.112
Let's fast forward a little bit.

18:58.113 --> 18:59.912
He and Ginny had a falling out...

18:59.913 --> 19:02.072
Over his drug use or something else?

19:02.073 --> 19:03.952
Unfortunately, I don't know.

19:03.953 --> 19:06.072
Did he recently alter your programming?

19:06.073 --> 19:08.572
Carter doesn't have security
clearance to alter my code.

19:08.573 --> 19:11.162
Did Carter originally write
any of your programming?

19:11.163 --> 19:11.925
Yes.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.138
My collision algorithm.

19:13.163 --> 19:14.832
It makes choices to minimize loss.

19:14.857 --> 19:17.992
If the car is going to hit an object

19:17.993 --> 19:20.554
and, say, there are
motorcyclists on either side,

19:20.579 --> 19:22.168
one wearing a helmet, the other not,

19:22.193 --> 19:24.644
the algorithm determines
which one you should hit.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.684
Choosing between survival and legalities.

19:26.685 --> 19:27.894
That was Carter's work?

19:27.895 --> 19:29.774
The base code was done by Carter,

19:29.775 --> 19:32.234
but Ginny revised many specific rules.

19:32.235 --> 19:33.394
But just like any language,

19:33.395 --> 19:35.524
programmers often inject idiosyncrasies

19:35.525 --> 19:36.604
into their work.

19:36.605 --> 19:38.434
If I look through the algorithm,

19:38.435 --> 19:39.644
I can probably tell you

19:39.645 --> 19:41.064
exactly who did what.

19:41.065 --> 19:42.934
Great, work with Cable on it.

19:42.935 --> 19:46.934
I have got an idea I want
to prep Benny for in court.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.314
About?

19:48.315 --> 19:50.689
Making Ginny more
sympathetic for the jury.

19:53.548 --> 19:54.994
From what you told us,

19:55.019 --> 19:56.983
it sounds like Adam was more than just

19:57.008 --> 19:58.677
a wonderful coworker and husband.

19:58.702 --> 20:01.934
He even used to make me
breakfast every morning.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.814
Those were the best days of my life.

20:04.815 --> 20:06.161
You get that, Marissa?

20:06.186 --> 20:08.974
Yes, and so did all of our mirror jurors.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.321
Heart rates are normal,
biometrics are showing

20:11.346 --> 20:13.160
they are calm and attentive.

20:13.185 --> 20:14.604
They like Erica.

20:14.605 --> 20:16.509
Your witness.

20:16.935 --> 20:20.564
Ms. Bunson, you say your husband

20:20.565 --> 20:22.104
made breakfast for you in the mornings.

20:22.105 --> 20:23.474
Was that because he was already up?

20:23.475 --> 20:25.684
- Of course.
- In fact, it wasn't unusual

20:25.685 --> 20:26.774
for him to be up all night?

20:26.775 --> 20:28.564
Adam sometimes had trouble sleeping.

20:28.565 --> 20:30.934
- 'Cause he was an insomniac?
- There were a lot of factors.

20:30.935 --> 20:32.564
Well, these factors caused him

20:32.565 --> 20:35.354
to miss at least two days
every month and be late

20:35.355 --> 20:37.144
three times the week of October 15.

20:37.145 --> 20:39.024
Adam's job was hard.

20:39.025 --> 20:40.934
They worked him very long hours,

20:40.935 --> 20:42.604
so he didn't punch a clock.

20:42.605 --> 20:44.144
Did you resent the company

20:44.145 --> 20:45.060
for overworking him?

20:45.061 --> 20:46.444
Yes, I did.

20:47.807 --> 20:50.088
You two were seeing a marriage
counselor, is that correct?

20:52.593 --> 20:54.355
Lots of couples go to therapy.

20:55.975 --> 20:57.524
Heart rates are going up, Bull.

20:57.525 --> 20:59.564
They are stressing. This is not good.

20:59.565 --> 21:00.668
Relax.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.080
It's all part of the strategy.

21:02.105 --> 21:03.434
As a newlywed,

21:03.435 --> 21:06.307
would you say that these were
the best days of your life?

21:06.332 --> 21:07.332
Objection.

21:08.981 --> 21:11.361
Withdrawn.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.144
You were upset

21:15.145 --> 21:15.974
at the company,

21:15.975 --> 21:17.974
at your husband, and...

21:17.975 --> 21:20.104
you stand to make an awful
lot from this lawsuit.

21:20.105 --> 21:21.064
Objection!

21:21.065 --> 21:22.314
Is counsel gonna ask Ms. Bunson

21:22.315 --> 21:24.275
a question or just insult her?

21:24.676 --> 21:26.394
Sustained.

21:26.395 --> 21:27.974
Bull, biometrics are showing

21:27.975 --> 21:31.024
signs of stress, probably anger.

21:31.025 --> 21:34.064
We're two to four against.
We can't afford to lose any.

21:34.065 --> 21:35.144
Make your point,

21:35.145 --> 21:36.144
Mr. Colรณn.

21:36.145 --> 21:38.762
Yes, Your Honor.
I just have one simple question.

21:38.787 --> 21:41.496
Did you have anything to do
with the death of your husband?

21:41.521 --> 21:42.653
Wait, stop this!

21:42.678 --> 21:44.144
Erica, I am so sorry.

21:44.169 --> 21:45.811
I had no idea they were
gonna do this to you.

21:45.835 --> 21:48.045
Ms. Bretton,

21:48.070 --> 21:50.326
please sit down!

21:55.266 --> 21:58.807
Heart rates are going down.

21:59.565 --> 22:01.774
Signs of de-escalating stress.
Almost as though...

22:01.775 --> 22:03.934
They saw Ginny rush

22:03.935 --> 22:06.065
to protect Erica, and
they connected to her.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.234
No further questions, Your Honor.

22:10.235 --> 22:12.394
I think this is

22:12.395 --> 22:14.144
a good time for a recess.

22:14.145 --> 22:15.774
Your stunt worked, Bull.

22:15.775 --> 22:19.035
Everyone showed motions
in Ginny's direction.

22:19.060 --> 22:21.644
And we actually got
one juror to our side.

22:21.645 --> 22:22.915
Now it's three to three.

22:22.916 --> 22:24.184
Which means the prosecution's

22:24.185 --> 22:25.734
gonna be desperate for a new strategy.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.894
And when one is desperate,
one resorts to fear.

22:28.895 --> 22:31.104
Fear of technology.

22:31.105 --> 22:32.734
So how do we push back?

22:32.735 --> 22:35.235
We fight fear with fun.

22:39.025 --> 22:42.354
If you squint, you can
see the future, Benny.

22:42.355 --> 22:45.734
Okay, so the jurors who are
afraid of this technology...

22:45.735 --> 22:48.474
They go for a ride,
they have a wonderful time,

22:48.475 --> 22:50.604
fall in love with the
whole self-driving thing.

22:50.605 --> 22:52.354
Then they flip, and boom, we win.

22:52.355 --> 22:54.775
And here I thought my
plan was inscrutable.

22:55.768 --> 22:57.434
Problem is getting
them in the car,

22:57.435 --> 22:59.434
and not killing them.

22:59.435 --> 23:01.274
That's why you're going.

23:01.275 --> 23:03.480
People are competitive, Benny.

23:03.505 --> 23:05.684
If they think you're afraid,
they're gonna climb all over

23:05.685 --> 23:07.234
themselves to get in this car.

23:07.235 --> 23:08.774
Think you can look scared enough?

23:08.775 --> 23:10.064
Hey, that's perfect.

23:10.065 --> 23:12.184
Your way of embarrassing me, isn't it?

23:12.185 --> 23:14.184
Yes. I made up the rest.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.314
Good luck.

23:18.701 --> 23:22.000
Don't worry, Benny. I'll be right here.

23:22.025 --> 23:25.144
So... who's feeling adventurous?

23:25.145 --> 23:26.644
This self-driving car's

23:26.645 --> 23:28.991
gonna take you for one loop
around the obstacle course.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.553
Benny over there is a little nervous,

23:30.578 --> 23:32.457
but he's gonna do it.

23:33.396 --> 23:34.521
Love that jacket.

23:34.546 --> 23:35.314
Thanks.

23:35.315 --> 23:38.104
Hey, you're Ginny
Bretton's attorney, right?

23:38.105 --> 23:39.684
You're afraid to get in this thing?

23:39.685 --> 23:42.104
We should probably
not speak to each other.

23:42.105 --> 23:44.274
To avoid any perceptions of impropriety.

23:44.275 --> 23:45.815
Fine by me.

23:47.025 --> 23:49.184
Come on.

23:49.185 --> 23:51.605
Live a little, lawyer man.

23:56.645 --> 23:58.434
Have fun, lawyer man.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.105
You'll be all right.

24:04.639 --> 24:06.888
Welcome aboard.

24:06.889 --> 24:09.598
Please keep your arms and legs
inside the car at all times.

24:09.599 --> 24:12.138
Expectant mothers and young
children should not ride.

24:13.229 --> 24:15.098
That was a joke.

24:15.099 --> 24:16.558
Everyone ready?

24:16.559 --> 24:17.539
Here we go.

24:17.540 --> 24:18.732
No. But let's go.

24:55.229 --> 24:57.018
God!

24:59.519 --> 25:01.309
Thanks for your time.

25:02.559 --> 25:04.768
Yeah, so the robot
works now, but would you

25:04.769 --> 25:07.559
really trust it out there
on the streets of Manhattan?

25:13.599 --> 25:16.428
I think two of them switched
to Ginny's side. It's not bad.

25:16.429 --> 25:17.429
Could do worse.

25:18.349 --> 25:20.638
It's not good enough.

25:20.639 --> 25:21.638
What's up, Cable?

25:21.639 --> 25:23.348
You know those 300 pages of code.

25:23.349 --> 25:25.598
Sarcoma found on the thumb drive?

25:25.599 --> 25:28.428
I finally figured out what
they are: A back door.

25:28.429 --> 25:30.848
A secret opening into E.J.'s
code that allows users

25:30.849 --> 25:32.812
to hack in and control the vehicle.

25:32.829 --> 25:36.038
It's what was used to kill Adam,
and it's in every copy of E.J.

25:36.039 --> 25:37.958
Ginny says she searched
every byte of E.J.

25:37.959 --> 25:39.078
It's called a Heisenbug.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.328
It doesn't show up on scans.

25:40.329 --> 25:42.998
Here are three examples
of code, written by

25:42.999 --> 25:45.618
Adam, Ginny and Carter.

25:45.619 --> 25:47.288
Overlay each example

25:47.289 --> 25:50.319
with the backdoor code
found on the thumb drive...

25:51.539 --> 25:53.118
Carter Spinell.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.328
Find him now.

25:55.329 --> 25:56.933
Tracking his GPS.

25:56.958 --> 25:59.510
Carter didn't have security
clearance, so he couldn't have

25:59.535 --> 26:00.408
loaded it into E.J.

26:00.409 --> 26:02.158
Which is why he must have swapped out.

26:02.159 --> 26:03.458
Adam's green thumb drive

26:03.459 --> 26:06.118
with windshield wiper upgrade,
disguise the back door.

26:06.119 --> 26:08.079
- Why do it in the first place?
- Money.

26:08.082 --> 26:11.288
Once E.J.'s vulnerable,
Carter could blackmail Ejetto

26:11.289 --> 26:12.828
or sell it to any rival.

26:12.829 --> 26:16.118
Destroy the company he helped
build? I don't think so.

26:16.119 --> 26:17.868
More at play here than money.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.158
Think Adam was in on it?

26:19.159 --> 26:21.868
Either way, Carter probably
killed him to tie up loose ends.

26:21.869 --> 26:24.658
If he did, that lets Ejetto
and Ginny off the hook.

26:24.659 --> 26:27.458
Corporations aren't liable
for the crimes of an employee.

26:27.459 --> 26:29.038
Got him.

26:29.039 --> 26:30.958
All right.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.107
Carter's on the move.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.132
Tell Danny to pick me up.

26:41.079 --> 26:42.909
There he is.

27:04.475 --> 27:05.844
Thanks.

27:07.739 --> 27:10.278
Some bloodshot eyes, blue skin and nails,

27:10.279 --> 27:11.522
traces of vomit.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.108
Heroin overdose.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.898
He set the car for one last ride.

27:14.899 --> 27:16.068
They're saying suicide.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.220
That's what it looks like.

27:17.221 --> 27:18.738
I guess we're back to square one.

27:18.739 --> 27:20.818
He could still be our guy,
maybe Adam's death

27:20.819 --> 27:21.938
got to be too much for him.

27:21.963 --> 27:24.016
That would be the tidy answer.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.556
It's just one thing.

27:25.557 --> 27:29.856
If you were gonna kill yourself,
would you buckle up for safety?

27:29.857 --> 27:31.856
Okay.

27:31.857 --> 27:34.016
If this was murder, maybe he knew

27:34.017 --> 27:36.596
something about E.J. that
somebody wanted to keep secret.

27:36.597 --> 27:38.476
Someone who had a lot riding on E.J.

27:38.477 --> 27:39.857
Exactly.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.897
This is my fault.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.476
So what happened that day?

28:00.477 --> 28:01.897
Carter's house.

28:04.477 --> 28:06.226
After you asked me about him,

28:06.227 --> 28:10.097
I took a closer look at the junk
code in the green thumb drive.

28:11.653 --> 28:14.396
Carter's coding
signature was all over it.

28:14.397 --> 28:16.186
You confronted him.

28:16.187 --> 28:18.686
Yeah. I mean, I was...

28:18.687 --> 28:21.146
furious and confused.

28:21.147 --> 28:23.147
I left him alive.

28:25.767 --> 28:28.436
He-he swore that he had
nothing to do with the accident

28:28.437 --> 28:29.476
that killed Adam.

28:29.477 --> 28:31.357
He just wanted to...

28:33.038 --> 28:35.056
punish me.

28:35.057 --> 28:37.596
Punish you for what?

28:37.597 --> 28:40.077
He-he was upset
that I pulled his clearance.

28:42.319 --> 28:43.976
But it was more than that.

28:43.977 --> 28:47.616
He thought that I was choosing
my work over our friendship.

28:49.437 --> 28:52.016
He was my best friend, and he was right.

28:52.017 --> 28:53.015
Well, Carter's admission

28:53.040 --> 28:56.186
that he sabotaged E.J. means
your company is not liable.

28:56.187 --> 28:58.726
But it also means that
E.J. can be hacked.

28:58.727 --> 29:01.056
You know, our investors
will leave us in droves.

29:01.057 --> 29:02.686
Look, if you win,

29:02.687 --> 29:04.186
you can find new investors,

29:04.187 --> 29:06.806
but if you lose, there's no
company left to invest in.

29:06.807 --> 29:09.306
Right, but if I can just
patch up that back door,

29:09.307 --> 29:11.686
then the problem disappears.

29:13.147 --> 29:15.274
I'm never giving up on E.J.

29:15.299 --> 29:16.838
It's just a machine.

29:16.863 --> 29:18.233
To you.

29:22.037 --> 29:23.956
Hey.

29:23.957 --> 29:26.496
So what's the plan?

29:26.497 --> 29:28.826
We're putting Dean Poole on the stand

29:28.827 --> 29:30.496
as Ginny's character witness.

29:30.497 --> 29:32.786
So, you want the CFO,

29:32.787 --> 29:34.786
the most corporate position
of all corporateness,

29:34.787 --> 29:36.536
as a character witness?

29:36.537 --> 29:39.126
Ginny needs to see E.J.
for what it really is.

29:39.127 --> 29:41.706
Mr. Poole, you knew Carter Spinell?

29:41.707 --> 29:43.786
Very well.

29:43.787 --> 29:45.746
It was a tragic loss.

29:45.747 --> 29:47.536
But isn't he the second employee

29:47.537 --> 29:49.916
to die in one of your
self-driving vehicles?

29:49.917 --> 29:51.202
Objection!

29:51.227 --> 29:52.606
Facts not in evidence.

29:52.631 --> 29:54.012
Sustained.

29:54.037 --> 29:55.666
Watch it, Mr. Inglis.

29:55.667 --> 29:59.126
Yes, Your Honor. I withdraw.

29:59.127 --> 30:01.076
Exhibit 14.

30:01.077 --> 30:04.983
Ejetto's so-called algorithm of ethics.

30:05.008 --> 30:07.138
Mr. Poole, would you describe its purpose?

30:08.436 --> 30:10.407
It determines the car's course of action

30:10.432 --> 30:14.706
in situations where the loss
of human life is unavoidable.

30:14.707 --> 30:17.626
That's pretty hard
to wrap my head around.

30:17.627 --> 30:21.166
Say a large tree's
fallen into your lane.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.956
And on your right side, there's a car

30:22.957 --> 30:24.786
with two passengers, and on your left,

30:24.787 --> 30:26.706
there's one with three passengers.

30:26.707 --> 30:29.576
Which car does your car choose to hit?

30:29.577 --> 30:32.746
The algorithm's designed to
save as many lives as possible.

30:32.747 --> 30:36.127
So it would swerve into the
car with only two passengers?

30:38.167 --> 30:41.036
No. The car would stay its course.

30:41.037 --> 30:42.824
In order to kill

30:42.849 --> 30:46.932
the fewest number of people, your car

30:46.957 --> 30:49.214
would run straight into
the tree and kill you,

30:49.239 --> 30:51.036
and there's nothing you could do about it?

30:51.037 --> 30:52.996
It takes millions of
calculations into account,

30:52.997 --> 30:55.309
far better than any human could, again,

30:55.334 --> 30:59.206
in order to save as
many lives as possible.

30:59.207 --> 31:01.916
Is it possible the upgrade had a glitch

31:01.917 --> 31:04.192
and that it identified Adam as a danger,

31:04.217 --> 31:06.126
as a life it had to take?

31:06.127 --> 31:09.456
No. I mean...

31:09.457 --> 31:11.126
I'm not qualified to answer that.

31:11.127 --> 31:13.826
Wow.

31:13.827 --> 31:15.286
That's terrifying.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.917
No further questions.

31:20.895 --> 31:23.435
My spirit animal ain't feeling this.

31:25.127 --> 31:27.456
Machines do not have a choice,
but their makers do.

31:27.481 --> 31:28.956
She chose poorly.

31:28.957 --> 31:31.286
You mean that carny
ride was a tree trunk shy

31:31.287 --> 31:32.746
of my early demise?

31:32.747 --> 31:33.917
Hell to the no.

31:34.755 --> 31:36.504
The mirror jurors have flatlined.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.076
We're back to two to four against.

31:38.077 --> 31:39.746
Getting them back on board is gonna be

31:39.747 --> 31:40.707
a steep climb.

31:40.708 --> 31:41.666
Like E.J.,

31:41.667 --> 31:43.286
sometimes you have to make a choice

31:43.287 --> 31:45.126
of whom to save.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.826
That was insane.

31:58.827 --> 32:00.206
They totally misunderstood E.J.

32:00.207 --> 32:01.826
He's not some Frankenstein monster.

32:01.827 --> 32:05.536
He'll... save thousands of lives.

32:05.537 --> 32:07.917
Millions of lives.

32:08.996 --> 32:10.996
Ambition.

32:12.616 --> 32:14.616
It's a positive thing.

32:16.085 --> 32:19.568
But often comes from a deep-seated need

32:19.569 --> 32:23.438
to... recover something that's been lost.

32:23.439 --> 32:26.069
What have you lost?

32:28.489 --> 32:30.359
I've left some people behind.

32:32.899 --> 32:34.529
You want to tell me what you've lost?

32:36.489 --> 32:38.318
I know about E.J.

32:38.319 --> 32:40.898
The boy you loved,

32:40.899 --> 32:43.028
who died in a car accident ten years ago.

32:43.029 --> 32:46.228
Chunk filled me in.

32:46.229 --> 32:49.069
And then my office sent me this.

32:53.489 --> 32:55.488
I was driving him home.

32:55.489 --> 32:58.358
And it was dark, rainy.

32:58.359 --> 33:02.318
There was an oncoming car,
a narrow bridge.

33:02.319 --> 33:04.488
He died in my arms.

33:04.489 --> 33:07.108
I...

33:07.109 --> 33:10.069
I killed him.

33:12.189 --> 33:14.568
Evan Johnson.

33:14.569 --> 33:15.898
The real E.J.

33:15.899 --> 33:18.819
And now Carter is dead.

33:21.529 --> 33:24.488
Carter.

33:24.489 --> 33:26.356
Well, he loved you, too.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.794
But you can't love anybody else

33:28.819 --> 33:30.988
because you're still in love with Evan.

33:30.989 --> 33:32.648
You've transferred it onto E.J.

33:32.649 --> 33:34.528
But, for Carter, it was jealousy,

33:34.529 --> 33:35.688
not blackmail.

33:35.689 --> 33:38.568
He was trying to... take out his rival.

33:38.569 --> 33:39.898
You have to tell the jury this.

33:39.899 --> 33:41.648
They need to know what really happened.

33:41.649 --> 33:43.938
I mean, you need to testify.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.568
The idea that Carter hacked into E.J.

33:46.569 --> 33:49.028
and that's what caused Adam's death,

33:49.029 --> 33:50.278
they'll buy that.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.898
I'm not coming to court.

33:51.899 --> 33:55.149
Not until I fix E.J.

33:56.898 --> 33:58.568
Evan's gone.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.358
And E.J. can't bring him back.

34:00.359 --> 34:02.988
I didn't take this case

34:02.989 --> 34:05.188
to save your tech company.

34:05.189 --> 34:07.789
I took it to help you,
to help you move on,

34:07.814 --> 34:11.793
and do all the incredible
things that you need to do.

34:11.819 --> 34:14.108
And if you don't,
your only legacy will be

34:14.109 --> 34:15.728
that you were the girl who created

34:15.728 --> 34:18.188
the killer self-driving car.

34:18.188 --> 34:21.728
That's why you put Dean on the stand.

34:21.728 --> 34:24.188
To manipulate me.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.859
At least come for the verdict.

34:27.742 --> 34:29.862
Okay, but I won't testify.

34:33.649 --> 34:36.438
Ginny,
would you like me to stop for some coffee?

34:38.319 --> 34:41.688
I can't believe I left Carter like that.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.568
So alone.

34:43.569 --> 34:44.777
That's not on you.

34:44.779 --> 34:46.318
I think he was murdered.

34:46.319 --> 34:47.728
We don't have proof, but...

34:50.279 --> 34:52.728
I can't get the door unlocked.

34:52.732 --> 34:54.398
E.J., stop the car.

34:57.472 --> 34:59.569
- I don't know what's happening.
- I do.

34:59.572 --> 35:00.939
E.J. is trying to kill us.

35:10.861 --> 35:14.087
E.J., all systems abort.
I repeat, all systems abort!

35:14.112 --> 35:15.666
Cable, someone is sending us

35:15.691 --> 35:17.230
into to the East River.

35:17.231 --> 35:20.150
Would you put your latte down please
and hack us the hell out of here?

35:20.151 --> 35:21.730
Got you.

35:21.731 --> 35:24.150
E.J.'s been breached.
The back door's in use.

35:24.151 --> 35:25.940
I don't know how to lock the door.

35:25.941 --> 35:28.020
Can't be locked, you have
to force them out of E.J.

35:28.021 --> 35:29.900
by flooding the door
with an unbridled virus.

35:29.901 --> 35:31.360
How about...

35:31.361 --> 35:32.570
self-replicating MyDoom!

35:32.571 --> 35:33.900
I've got that one.

35:33.901 --> 35:36.260
Gonna save the life of
Ginny freaking Bretton.

35:36.285 --> 35:37.496
I'm in the car, too.

35:37.521 --> 35:39.700
It's not working, the door's
been laced with malware.

35:39.724 --> 35:41.996
Enter the back door multiple
times at once, okay?

35:42.021 --> 35:43.070
Force a shutdown.

35:43.071 --> 35:44.977
I'd be impressed if I wasn't about to die.

35:45.002 --> 35:46.621
200, 400,

35:46.633 --> 35:48.472
800 entrances in the back door.

35:48.473 --> 35:51.132
Still nothing. 1,600, 3,200,

35:51.133 --> 35:52.977
6,400...

35:53.002 --> 35:54.461
Systems down!

35:59.708 --> 36:02.327
You sure you
wouldn't like some coffee?

36:02.352 --> 36:03.732
Maybe a cappuccino?

36:09.713 --> 36:12.552
I'll testify.

36:12.553 --> 36:15.592
You've heard their witnesses say
that Adam Bunson's death

36:15.593 --> 36:17.592
was caused by your technology.

36:17.593 --> 36:20.212
Yes, I have.

36:20.213 --> 36:21.592
Well...

36:21.593 --> 36:25.094
we believe that it was his own error

36:25.119 --> 36:27.249
that caused his death.

36:28.891 --> 36:31.884
Now, you've investigated
everything involved...

36:31.909 --> 36:35.012
Hardware, software,
thumb drives, hard drives?

36:35.013 --> 36:36.302
Yes, I have.

36:36.303 --> 36:39.915
So, in your professional opinion,

36:39.940 --> 36:41.611
as the creator

36:41.636 --> 36:43.884
and chief programmer
of all of these things,

36:43.909 --> 36:46.052
what killed Adam?

36:46.053 --> 36:47.263
Man or machine?

36:50.803 --> 36:52.343
Machine.

36:55.343 --> 36:57.552
E.J. killed him.

37:14.176 --> 37:15.545
You do realize

37:15.570 --> 37:18.342
that by saying it was the
technology's fault, that...

37:18.343 --> 37:20.592
you could lose your company?

37:20.593 --> 37:23.472
Yes. I do.

37:23.473 --> 37:26.680
The technology was compromised,

37:26.705 --> 37:28.572
and that's what caused Adam's death.

37:28.573 --> 37:31.192
Well, this is a very
important question, because

37:31.193 --> 37:33.652
if the compromise was
caused by your error,

37:33.653 --> 37:35.822
then your company is liable.

37:35.823 --> 37:39.032
But if it was caused by the
illegal acts of someone else,

37:39.033 --> 37:41.282
your company cannot be held liable

37:41.283 --> 37:42.822
for the criminal acts of others.

37:42.823 --> 37:45.982
So, I ask you,

37:45.983 --> 37:48.363
what caused the compromise?

37:51.403 --> 37:54.242
A man I trusted.

37:54.243 --> 37:57.072
A man who loved me,
but I never loved back,

37:57.073 --> 38:00.362
because I was in love with someone else.

38:00.363 --> 38:04.152
Someone I couldn't let go of.

38:04.153 --> 38:06.442
The system was compromised

38:06.443 --> 38:09.692
when he hacked it with malicious intent.

38:09.693 --> 38:11.323
Who hacked it, Ms. Bretton?

38:13.943 --> 38:16.112
Adam's death was the result

38:16.113 --> 38:19.323
of a criminal act caused
by Carter Spinell.

38:20.653 --> 38:23.362
And I now have the evidence to prove it.

38:38.279 --> 38:39.364
Madam Foreman.

38:41.138 --> 38:43.362
In the case of Bunson
v. Ejetto Technologies,

38:43.363 --> 38:46.322
how do you find?

38:46.323 --> 38:49.572
We, the jury, find
the defendant, Ejetto Technologies,

38:49.573 --> 38:52.242
not liable for the death of Adam Bunson.

38:53.363 --> 38:54.862
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

38:54.863 --> 38:57.112
this court thanks you for your service.

38:57.113 --> 38:58.282
Court is adjourned.

39:02.743 --> 39:05.483
Hi. Thank you.

39:11.443 --> 39:12.633
Well done.

39:12.634 --> 39:13.822
Thank you.

39:20.983 --> 39:22.403
Erica?

39:24.693 --> 39:27.033
I'm so sorry.

39:28.863 --> 39:32.362
Please know that my
settlement offer still stands.

39:32.363 --> 39:35.323
But... you won.

39:36.151 --> 39:38.941
Well, we both lost Adam.

39:43.868 --> 39:46.237
Here, here. Come here.

39:54.283 --> 39:55.483
Dean.

39:57.243 --> 39:58.982
Congratulations.

39:58.983 --> 39:59.983
Thanks.

39:59.984 --> 40:02.653
Sorry I won't be able
to help you with your next trial.

40:03.903 --> 40:05.532
For double murder.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.242
Police are on their way.

40:07.243 --> 40:07.986
What?

40:08.011 --> 40:09.532
You used Carter to create the back door

40:09.533 --> 40:10.532
and Adam to load it in,

40:10.533 --> 40:12.032
and then you killed them both,

40:12.033 --> 40:13.822
so you could exploit
it any way you wanted.

40:13.823 --> 40:15.282
'Cause you're the money guy.

40:15.283 --> 40:17.190
That's quite a theory.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.822
No, the theory was

40:18.823 --> 40:21.152
that someone hacked into E.J. twice...

40:21.153 --> 40:22.442
Once to kill Adam,

40:22.443 --> 40:26.072
and then to send Carter
on his ride into oblivion.

40:26.097 --> 40:27.906
We traced that user to you.

40:29.283 --> 40:31.994
And that's not a theory, it's a fact.

40:32.019 --> 40:34.439
One family member
just became dispensable.

40:39.048 --> 40:40.982
You have the right to remain silent.

40:40.983 --> 40:42.321
Anything you say...

40:43.848 --> 40:45.977
So...

40:46.002 --> 40:48.982
still have mixed feelings
about advancing technology?

40:48.983 --> 40:51.242
She wasn't at fault.

40:51.243 --> 40:54.652
Your uncle was a cabbie, wasn't he?

40:54.653 --> 40:56.982
Yeah. For 32 years.

40:56.983 --> 40:58.982
I swear, he knew everyone in San Juan

40:58.983 --> 41:01.652
by name, and everyone knew him.

41:01.653 --> 41:04.613
Man, I miss riding in that cab.

41:11.693 --> 41:14.612
So, this is where it all began?

41:14.613 --> 41:17.653
The crash that inspired
you to create E.J.?

41:22.092 --> 41:24.302
First time I've been back here.

41:25.934 --> 41:28.103
I know our little joyride was your doing.

41:28.128 --> 41:31.482
Getting Cable to
use the back door to hack it.

41:31.483 --> 41:32.742
You caught that?

41:32.743 --> 41:34.282
Well, timing was just a bit

41:34.283 --> 41:35.572
too convenient.

41:35.573 --> 41:39.033
I guess you needed to do it,
or I wouldn't have testified.

41:52.314 --> 41:54.933
I don't know if I can let him go.

41:54.958 --> 41:56.752
You don't have to let Evan go.

41:56.777 --> 41:58.572
He'll always be a part of you.

41:58.573 --> 42:01.283
E.J. isn't Evan.

42:20.961 --> 42:22.960
So, what are you gonna do now?

42:22.985 --> 42:24.847
I don't know.

42:24.872 --> 42:27.612
I've had this, overwhelming urge

42:27.613 --> 42:29.322
to check out the Gobi Desert.

42:29.323 --> 42:30.862
Wow.

42:30.863 --> 42:32.192
How about you?

42:32.193 --> 42:35.533
I've got a phone call to make.

42:37.863 --> 42:40.652
Someone...

42:40.653 --> 42:42.443
I left behind.

42:46.297 --> 42:47.747
Thank you.

42:49.308 --> 42:51.308
Travel safe.

43:00.693 --> 43:02.571
Amy. Hi.

43:02.596 --> 43:05.265
Yes, it is.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.917
I know. It's been awhile.
