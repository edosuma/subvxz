WEBVTT

00:40.248 --> 00:44.377
BETWEEN 1939 AND 1945, THE NAZIS MURDERED
OVER TEN MILLION "ENEMIES" OF THE STATE,

00:44.461 --> 00:49.049
SIX MILLION OF THEM EUROPEAN JEWS.

00:49.924 --> 00:54.721
AT THE END OF THE WAR,
HITLER, HIMMLER AND GOERING

00:54.804 --> 00:59.267
ALL ESCAPED JUSTICE BY
TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES.

00:59.350 --> 01:03.938
THE REMAINING MASTERMIND OF
THE HOLOCAUST VANISHED,

01:04.022 --> 01:08.777
AND WAS NEVER
BROUGHT TO TRIAL AT NUREMBERG.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.030
A DECADE LATER, MOST OF THE WORLD
HAD STOPPED WONDERING

01:12.113 --> 01:15.867
WHAT BECAME OF THE HEAD OF
THE SS "OFFICE OF JEWISH AFFAIRS"...

I'm Lieutenant Dalton.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.410
Lieutenant Dalton.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.661
[door opens]

02:41.744 --> 02:42.829
-[man] Herr Werner?
-Yes.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.790
I'm Lieutenant Dalton, up from Viden.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.586
We've found a few inconsistencies
in our records from your time with us

02:49.669 --> 02:51.588
and we'd appreciate your help
clarifying them.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.299
-Thank you so much.
-[Werner] Mm-hmm.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.759
[Herr Werner grunts]

03:06.769 --> 03:07.645
Please.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.524
[woman]
What do you want from us?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.568
-It's all right.
-He didn't do anything to you.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.819
He was a medic.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.738
I don't know what stories
he's been telling you,

03:16.821 --> 03:19.282
but we know who he is, Vera.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.450
My name is Annie.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.619
No.

03:23.411 --> 03:27.874
No, your sons Klaus and the other boy,
Dieter, they...

03:31.127 --> 03:32.503
[gunshots]

03:32.587 --> 03:34.631
-[Annie screams]
-Shit! Shit! Moshe!

03:35.298 --> 03:37.217
[Dalton] It's the wrong guy.
It's not even him!

03:37.842 --> 03:38.885
[Moshe] So, what?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.430
He was a Nazi.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.100
I bet he was on someone's list.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.562
[Moshe] You gonna give us a hand
or what? Come on.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.942

03:57.028 --> 03:59.072
[man 1 speaking in Hebrew]

03:59.155 --> 04:01.199
[man 2]
I remember reading years ago

04:01.699 --> 04:05.995
some Austrian they mistook for me.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.791
I have the article framed at home.

04:12.543 --> 04:16.631
I hope that future historians

04:17.006 --> 04:22.428
will not be tempted to stray from
the truth as we record it here today.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.808
I could talk of what I saw

04:27.267 --> 04:29.060
at the pits, in Minsk.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.730
Or the vans at Chelmno,

04:33.231 --> 04:36.025
but these were the deeds
and demands of others.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.278
I issued no such orders.

04:39.153 --> 04:42.115
Our work was paperwork,

04:43.324 --> 04:45.034
our war a numerical one.

04:46.411 --> 04:50.248
And though I struggled against
endless idiocy,

04:51.541 --> 04:57.588
I only did what little I could
in Germany's fight against her enemies.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.717
[applause]

05:00.800 --> 05:02.218

05:24.949 --> 05:27.410

07:25.445 --> 07:28.364
[woman] You said you wanted
to take a job in Jersey.

07:28.448 --> 07:33.161
Couldn't we run away?
I'd do anything to be with you. Anything!

07:33.244 --> 07:35.455
That's not a bad idea.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.665
That's not a bad idea at all.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.543
-Just tell me one thing.
-Yes.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.628
Is it true?

07:42.712 --> 07:44.338
Is what true?

07:44.589 --> 07:46.215
Is your mother a nigger?

07:47.258 --> 07:48.468
[man] Tell me.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.637
-[man shouting] Tell me!
-[woman] What difference does it make?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.723
-You love me.
-All the kids talking behind my back.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.017
-[man] Is it true? Are you black?
-[woman] No!

07:56.100 --> 07:57.727
[woman] No, I'm as white as you.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.770
-[man] You're lying.
-[woman] I'm not!

07:59.854 --> 08:02.648
-[man] You're lying. You are!
-[woman] I'm not! I'm not!

08:02.732 --> 08:04.734

-[scoffs and chuckles]

08:06.235 --> 08:08.821

-[shushes again]
-[shushes back, chuckles]

08:26.464 --> 08:29.300
-[man] So, you're German too?
-[woman] Well, my father is.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.678
I'd love to meet him sometime.
Can I see you again?

08:36.098 --> 08:39.435
Father made us learn
100 Spanish words a day.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.605
-One hundred.
-No more, no less.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.856
I was...

08:44.649 --> 08:45.983
I was terrible.

08:46.275 --> 08:51.197
I just wanted to ride horses
and explore Tucumán.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.158
What part of the Fatherland are you from?

08:55.034 --> 08:57.203
[man] We moved all over during the war.

08:57.703 --> 09:01.457
Oh, so your father,
he was in the army?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.209
SS, actually.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.546
But he was killed in the East.

09:08.631 --> 09:09.966
Oh, I thought, I thought...

09:10.049 --> 09:13.094
[man] We live with my uncle now,
Ricardo. He's, uh...

09:14.387 --> 09:16.222
He's like a father to us.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.391
[woman] I'm so sorry, Klaus.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.142
That's awful.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.897
Do you ever think about going back?

09:25.898 --> 09:27.149
[Klaus] To Germany?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.777
Um, I don't know.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.904
I'm told things.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.740
What things?

09:36.117 --> 09:39.662
Oh, the Jews, clawing power back,

09:40.246 --> 09:43.082
taking jobs,
corrupting everything, like before.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.045
But, of course, there are plenty
of them here too so...

09:49.171 --> 09:54.468
My uncle says they pop up everywhere,
like mushrooms after rain.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.554
-[Klaus chuckles]
-[chuckles]

09:56.637 --> 09:58.180
-Mushrooms.
-[Klaus chuckles]

09:58.264 --> 09:59.599
-[laughs]
-[chuckles]

10:00.600 --> 10:02.643
-[laughing] Mushrooms.
-[woman laughs out loud]

10:02.727 --> 10:04.854
[all three laughing]

10:06.063 --> 10:07.023
A toast.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.361
To your father.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.866
A hero, I'm sure.

10:16.949 --> 10:17.908
[clinking glasses]

10:18.534 --> 10:19.452
Prost!

10:26.042 --> 10:29.337
Tell me, would I recognize his name?

Mr. Harel. Just five minutes.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.310
[man 2] Herr Harel, please.
Sir, this is Herr Fritz Bauer,

10:44.393 --> 10:46.812
he's the District Attorney of Hessen
in West Germany.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.356
He says he's found someone.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.983
[Herr Fritz Bauer] I have a lead
on a great enemy of our people.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.402
I don't have time for this.
Rafi, take care of it, okay?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.988
[Herr Fritz Bauer] Adolf Eichmann
is not just some pencil pusher.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.868
This man deserves to be punished.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.953
[Harel]
You have the word of a blind man.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.666
[Bauer] He doesn't need his eyes
to hear the boy's name. Klaus Eichmann.

11:07.249 --> 11:11.420
[Harel] Why would this girl, Sylvia,
date a Nazi's son?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.048
Hermann spent time in Dachau;

11:14.382 --> 11:16.217
he decided to raise Sylvia Catholic.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.927
[Rafi] She didn't know she was Jewish?

11:18.761 --> 11:19.804
No.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.889
Has he broken the bad news to her yet?

11:22.181 --> 11:25.393
[Bauer chuckles] Yeah.
She insists on seeing him still.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.812
Says she's a good Catholic
and the boy is, too.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.314
[Harel] Okay. Thank you.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.858
Listen, I really appreciate your coming,

11:33.526 --> 11:36.487
but you have to understand.
I got Egypt wreaking havoc,

11:37.154 --> 11:39.532
the Fedayeen.
Hikers getting killed at Masada.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.950
Our resources are limited.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.786
I can't waste them chasing rumors.
I'm sorry.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.870
Think what it means.

11:45.830 --> 11:50.668
Jews finally, publicly, holding to account
the man who organized our slaughter.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.003
Organized. Past tense.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.131
It is my job, Herr Bauer,

11:55.589 --> 11:57.758
to focus on those
who are planning it today.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.552
Thank you very much for coming.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.929
-Please--
-[Harel] Thank you very much.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.812
Just give me one second.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.065
[Harel clears throat]

12:15.359 --> 12:16.318
Sir?

12:20.489 --> 12:21.907
Let's say he's right.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.910
Can you imagine the headache
when he tells the world

12:24.994 --> 12:29.123
that we wouldn't waste our resources
on the architect of the Final Solution?

12:33.335 --> 12:34.462
[man] Slowly.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.381

12:38.591 --> 12:39.842
Slowly.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.386

12:47.141 --> 12:48.350
What are you...?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.520
Shall we just stand here?

12:51.645 --> 12:53.481
You're waving at my crotch
in a weird way.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.483
Just get in there. Don't be afraid.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.485
I'm not afraid,
we're focusing on technique.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.446
Okay, well technically,
do it better.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.365
You know why they throw
all the shittiest jobs at you, right?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.493
I don't know, antisemitism?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.288
Shall we?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.291
Don't be scared.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.044
[grunts] Oh!

13:17.755 --> 13:19.423
-Hey.
-Hey, Rafi.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.551
-[Rafi] Aharoni, come with me.
-[Aharoni] You got it.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.307
-Where you going?
-[Rafi] Aharoni's got a flight to catch.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.100
I'll call if I need you.

That's the Deputy Mayor

15:21.503 --> 15:23.589
[Sylvia] Who is that man
you introduced me to?

15:23.672 --> 15:27.384
[Klaus] Carlos Fuldner.
He helped my family settle in Argentina.

[crowd silences]

...gunshots,

violence,

16:08.258 --> 16:10.427
every day across Buenos Aires?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.766
Now should be the time to
celebrate our national unity,

16:17.101 --> 16:20.396
the iron bond of church and state.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.735
It doesn't decay, amigos.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.449
A rot within our society,

16:32.950 --> 16:38.163
that is forcing us to fight for
our beloved and holy patria.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.501
Who can tell me its name?

16:43.794 --> 16:44.628
Jew!

16:44.712 --> 16:46.296
[crowd starts chattering]

16:46.380 --> 16:47.715

Thank you, Father.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.884
Loyal only to themselves.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.595
The Jew will betray our homeland

16:53.679 --> 16:57.474
and continue poisoning
this great nation of Argentina.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.062
So, I ask you.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.150
What should we do with the Jew?

17:08.193 --> 17:09.361
Soap.

17:10.112 --> 17:10.946
Again.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.407

Hello.

18:33.695 --> 18:34.905
Mama?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.866
Mama, what's wrong? What happened?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.701
[mother] Your sister.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.454
She was on top and I closed it.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.499
It's all right.
I'm sure she forgives you.

18:46.917 --> 18:47.751
Look.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.420
Beautiful.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.006
Go put them in some water.
I'll clean up.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.467

18:56.301 --> 18:57.678
Who'd you kill to get that?

18:58.053 --> 19:00.430
Seriously, should I worry?
Is there a dead body in there?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.651
Mama, please.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.279
What? First you see her all the time.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.947
-No relationship talk.
-You were ready...

19:17.030 --> 19:20.284
-We've been over this. Eat your soup.
-...to start something. Poof. She's gone.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.452
Please.

[telephone rings]

19:39.094 --> 19:41.263
[phone ringing]

19:42.890 --> 19:44.558
It could be an emergency.

19:44.641 --> 19:48.187
Don't come complaining to me
if you get sick after eating cold soup.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.607
Who gets sick from eating cold soup?
Ma, please. Hello.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.110
Is this about the Astypalaia thing?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.571
Because, to be honest,
I've read maybe 70% of the briefing.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.407
-[Rafi] No, it is not.
-Okay, good, 'cause it's more like 30%.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.450
Finale.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.541
[Rafi] Aharoni's out there now running
reconnaissance in Buenos Aires

20:09.625 --> 20:11.084
with our guy at the Embassy.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.462
Our contact's daughter, Sylvia Hermann,

20:13.545 --> 20:16.465
has agreed to take us to
Klaus Eichmann's family home.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.510
If it is Eichmann, they will attempt
to get a positive photo ID.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.222
Why didn't you ask me?
Aharoni's an interrogator.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.264
[Rafi] Precisely.

20:24.348 --> 20:28.143
I wanted someone who would interrogate
the evidence rather than just shoot at it.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.437
This is strictly catch and extract.

20:30.520 --> 20:34.691
Raf, if it is him, a bullet would
be easier than dragging him here.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.985
Eichmann will stand trial here in Israel.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.112
Trial?
Nobody needs to hear what he has to say.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.739
[Rafi] The Prime Minister disagrees.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.075
A trial will help put all of this to bed.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.245
After all, not everyone's
as emotionally balanced as you are.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.540
Peter, it isn't about you, okay?

20:53.168 --> 20:54.711
Okay. I'm in.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.129
[Harel] You're not going.

20:56.213 --> 21:00.592
Every op leader describes you as
manipulative, impulsive and self-absorbed.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.344
[Peter] No one mentioned
my sense of humor?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.054
[Harel] And the fiasco in Austria.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.723
The strings I had to pull.
You killed the wrong damn Nazi!

21:06.807 --> 21:09.518
I remember, sir.
It wasn't even the right Nazi.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.605
We are talking about violating
Argentina's sovereignty

21:13.689 --> 21:16.692
while they are celebrating
150 years of independence.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.070
If we fail, Israel will be humiliated,

21:20.153 --> 21:23.949
the local Jews terrorized,
and I've lost some of my best agents.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.993
So, what makes him worth the risk?

21:26.076 --> 21:28.537
For starters,
this current plan's a real piece of shit.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.705
[Harel] Great start.

21:29.955 --> 21:30.956
[Rafi] Peter.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.542
If you wanna get him out alive,
you need a basic crew.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.961
No soldiers, no guns. Period.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.130
If we get into a shoot-out,
we've failed already

21:38.213 --> 21:40.799
and it says here
that you want to extract him

21:40.882 --> 21:43.010
via shipping container,
but that would take weeks.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.847
We do that, he won't make it past Rio.
The only way is by plane.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.765
[Harel] Military planes
can't reach Argentina.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.935
You think I haven't thought about it?

21:53.228 --> 21:56.565
No, I'm sorry.
Of course, sir. Of course.

21:56.732 --> 21:59.651
I'm guessing El Al is not an option.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.362
El Al doesn't fly commercially
to Argentina.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.702
Perhaps if we had a good cover story,
they could be convinced?

22:09.286 --> 22:10.203
Maybe.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.165
[Peter] You said it's Argentina's
150th anniversary, right?

22:13.248 --> 22:14.082
Yeah.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.253
So we get ambassadors,
politicians, whatever,

22:18.337 --> 22:21.673
send them over there to say,
"Mazel tov. Hurrah for independence."

22:21.757 --> 22:24.051
[Rafi] We'll invite Abba Eban,
everybody loves him.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.013
Then we sneak Eichmann on board,
airlift him here direct.

22:28.096 --> 22:29.639
[Harel] What about airport security?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.351
I'll disguise him to look like one of us.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.394
-[Rafi] He'll struggle.
-We'll sedate him.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.272
Make him seem hung over, drunk to shit.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.649
[Harel]
To keep him in that state for hours.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.570
-The only agent that we have--
-[Rafi] Had.

22:43.653 --> 22:44.488
What?

22:44.571 --> 22:47.532
She's refused every job
I've offered her after Bren.

22:48.283 --> 22:51.411
That wasn't Hanna's fault though.
The guy was allergic, right?

22:51.620 --> 22:54.456
She's the only one with
the right field experience for this.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.126
-I'll get her to do it.
-I thought you two weren't...

22:58.210 --> 22:59.669
-What, together?
-Speaking.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.923
She'll do it, trust me. Sir...

23:04.216 --> 23:06.218
we'll get him back here alive.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.679
Get Hanna on board, then we talk.

to the camps, that was him.

-I'm not joining your hit squad.
-[Peter] No, that...

24:01.398 --> 24:04.151
Yes, I would happily put a bullet
in-between his eyes,

24:04.234 --> 24:05.610
but that's not what we're doing.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.407
Did you hear what happened last time?

24:10.782 --> 24:13.452
Yeah. Rafi told me. The guy was allergic.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.037
That's what he told you?

24:16.913 --> 24:18.623
[Hanna] No, we kept on landing
and refueling.

24:18.707 --> 24:23.628
Rafi kept telling me to put him
under again and again and again.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.047
So, I did.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.550
That was Rafi's fault, not yours.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.552
My needle, my fault.

24:31.052 --> 24:34.639
First do no harm, that's what we swear,
and I won't break it, not again!

24:34.723 --> 24:36.141
That's why we need you.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.103
-Leaving the meeting like that.
-I know.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.439
I had to leave, and I'm sorry.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.025
Carlos...

31:03.069 --> 31:05.446
He said he thought you might be a...

31:05.655 --> 31:06.489
I am.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.537
[Sylvia] Does that really matter to you?

31:45.028 --> 31:47.947
-[indistinct chatter]
-[typewriter clacks]

31:49.407 --> 31:50.575
[Rafi] Isser is here.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.953
[Rafi] This is Dani Shalom
from documents, and you know Moshe,

31:54.037 --> 31:55.371
he'd handle the vehicles.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.749
[Harel] Where's Hanna?

32:01.377 --> 32:02.921
Sorry I'm late, sir.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.757
That steak better be good.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.635
[Harel] Okay.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.305
[Harel] This is everything
Sylvia Hermann could give us.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.933
As for the pictures,
our guy at Tel Hashomer Hospital

32:15.016 --> 32:16.392
is saying the ears match.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.769
Hardly compelling evidence.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.229
Sylvia heard Klaus call him father.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.565
-"You don't need to call me that."
-[Harel] Not enough.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.860
You have to make sure it's him.
Give me documentary proof. Come on.

32:26.736 --> 32:27.987
Wait. Look.

32:28.863 --> 32:29.739
The flowers.

32:30.698 --> 32:34.077
-Here.
-Vera implied it was a special occasion.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.454
"This year even more so."

32:37.163 --> 32:39.290
-What date was Sylvia there?
-Uh...

32:39.791 --> 32:40.875
[Hanna] Here.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.711
The marriage certificate.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.341
-[Rafi] Hey, careful.
-Like it makes a difference.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.134
There's a system to this.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.804
[Peter] Here.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.932
Why is 1960 a special year?

32:56.015 --> 32:58.601
Because 25 years ago Adolf Eichmann

32:58.685 --> 33:02.313
married his wife,
Vera Liebl, on the 21st of March.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.565
[Peter] We have our guy.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.819
Ricardo Klement is Adolf Eichmann.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.116
[indistinct chatter and laughter]

33:13.199 --> 33:14.826
[Peter] All right. Round two.

33:14.909 --> 33:17.245
-[piano playing]
-[Peter] Next week in Buenos Aires.

33:17.787 --> 33:21.332
Yaakov, welcome.
Our wonderful front man.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.751
He's a little ugly,
but we'll make do, right?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.211
[Yaakov in Hebrew]
Todah rabah.

33:25.294 --> 33:29.048
Okay. For the ones who can't.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.510
-[Hanna in Hebrew] Yimakh shimo.
-[everyone] Yimakh shimo.

33:32.927 --> 33:35.138
May his name be obliterated, huh?

33:36.681 --> 33:38.808
So, why are we making him famous?

33:38.891 --> 33:41.477
[Moshe] We should be putting him down
like a mad dog.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.646
That's not what I'm here for, Moshe.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.647
[Moshe] Yeah?

33:45.648 --> 33:47.066
How many did you lose?

33:48.776 --> 33:50.361
I'm not competing with you.

33:55.324 --> 33:56.159
What?

33:57.201 --> 33:58.578
-We're really doing this?
-Yeah.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.080
[Yaakov] All right, asshole.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.208
My parents, aunts, uncles, four cousins.

34:04.959 --> 34:05.793
Dachau.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.342
[Dani Shalom] I'm the only one left.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.887
[Peter] Hey, Moshe, enough.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.098
All right?
Raf, you know any rock 'n roll?

34:19.182 --> 34:20.266
Is the Pope Catholic?

34:20.892 --> 34:22.477
[all laughing]

34:23.144 --> 34:24.937
-[piano playing cheerful music]
-This.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.022
[Hanna] Eh!

34:26.647 --> 34:29.609
-Shall we dance, yeah? Let's.
-Let's dance.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.404
-[piano continues]
-[Hanna laughs]

34:33.488 --> 34:35.448
[Harel] On your feet
for the Prime Minister.

34:35.531 --> 34:38.493
[Rafi] Oh, shit. It's Ben-Gurion.
Get up. Get up.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.745

-[man coughs]

34:46.000 --> 34:46.959
[man] Sir.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.547
-Is this all of them?
-Yes.

34:52.965 --> 34:53.883
[Ben-Gurion] Good.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.723
If you succeed...

35:02.642 --> 35:05.603
we deny the world the chance
to let Eichmann's...

35:06.813 --> 35:09.732
murderous edicts sink into obscurity.

35:10.608 --> 35:14.237
For the first time in our history,
we will judge our executioner.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.409
We will also warn off any
who may wish to follow his example.

35:22.995 --> 35:24.288
If you fail...

35:27.458 --> 35:29.335
he escapes justice.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.548
Perhaps forever.

35:36.008 --> 35:39.303
For the sake of our people,
I beg you, do not fail.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.976
[Ben-Gurion] Our memory reaches back
through recorded history.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.063
[Ben-Gurion]
The book of memories still lies open.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.941
And you here now...

35:53.651 --> 35:55.611
are the hand that holds the pen.

I think we'll take this one.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.162
[official] Excellent.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.206
Good choice.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.375
[Hanna in French]

37:33.209 --> 37:34.043
[in Spanish] Yes.

37:34.669 --> 37:39.215
[Yaakov] And an apartment
for my assistant. Nothing fancy.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.425

37:42.051 --> 37:42.969
Mm-hmm.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.304
Keep your hands to yourself.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.723
Or Malkin will kick my ass?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.058
I'll kick your ass.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.227
There's still the thing with you two.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.688
[Yaakov] He'll let you down, you know?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.856
[Yaakov] He lets everyone down.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.987

[Yaakov] Ladies and gentlemen, behold,

With the finest
in counter-surveillance technology.

38:46.073 --> 38:49.201
[Eichmann] I've lived enough of life
looking over my shoulder.

38:49.910 --> 38:54.415
I only did what little I could
in Germany's fight against her enemy.

38:54.915 --> 38:57.084
[applause]

38:57.168 --> 39:00.254
[Carlos] What a narrative. What tales.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.756
[Carlos] Tell me,

39:01.839 --> 39:05.051
these story telling sessions,
are they for money or for pleasure?

39:05.760 --> 39:09.889
For posterity, to correct the lies
told by those swine at Nuremberg.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.182
[Carlos] Huh.

39:11.640 --> 39:16.479
You left so quickly after our rally,
we didn't have a chance to talk.

39:16.562 --> 39:19.148
I wasn't aware a discussion
was to be had, Carlos.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.278
You saw the support we have.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.532
The government is teetering.
Soon we can come out of the shadows.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.160
All we need is organization.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.412
A mind like yours.

-[Peter] Who's this Fuldner guy?
-[Aharoni] SS Officer.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.963
Worked with the Vatican,

39:43.047 --> 39:47.093
then Peron to get Hitler's
higher-ranking officers out of Europe.

39:47.635 --> 39:51.263
They keep a low profile, but they'll
make themselves known if we slip up.

39:52.181 --> 39:54.934
-I've written this all down.
-Oh.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.479
Yeah, I'll read this.

40:36.559 --> 40:39.145

40:44.859 --> 40:46.485
[Peter] The man is a human metronome.

40:46.569 --> 40:50.322
Every morning he goes to work at
a Mercedes factory in Gonzales Catan,

40:50.865 --> 40:53.451
same time, same two buses,
there and back.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.786
[man] Why don't we grab him
at the factory?

40:55.870 --> 40:58.247
[Rafi] It's too public.
One witness and we're screwed.

40:58.330 --> 41:02.376
[Peter] And on his journey home
it's darker, there's fewer witnesses.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.086
[Dani] Any blind spots?

41:04.170 --> 41:07.006
There are lamp posts
here, here, and here.

41:07.089 --> 41:10.968
There's a blind spot about five meters.
Should be pitch black at night.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.803
That's where you grab him,

41:12.887 --> 41:15.306
and then hold him here
a few hours ahead of flying.

41:15.389 --> 41:17.975
-[Peter] Can we get him to the airport?
-No, It's too dangerous.

41:18.517 --> 41:22.521
[Hanna] I'll be giving him micro doses
of Haloperidol throughout security.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.315
The set-up needs to be precise,

41:24.398 --> 41:26.734
so fixing it in the back of the car,
it's too risky.

41:27.359 --> 41:30.946
The wrong dose
and he could slip into cardiac arrest.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.825
Okay. Everyone got what they need?

41:34.992 --> 41:36.202
[Yaakov] Strips of soft metal.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.245
-[Harel] Okay.
-Tin, ideally.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.580
[Ilani] Write it down.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.583
I'm putting together a squad
of sayanim to help.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.793
Are we sure
we can trust the local Jews

41:44.877 --> 41:46.879
to be loyal to us and not the Argentines?

41:46.962 --> 41:48.881
Yeah. Efraim worked with them
before, right?

41:48.964 --> 41:52.510
Yeah, that's correct.
They know the city, speak the language.

41:52.635 --> 41:53.886
They'll help limit our exposure.

41:54.678 --> 41:57.973
People are gonna say it's a real
international Jewish conspiracy.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.767
-[everyone chuckles]
-[Harel] Okay. Hey,

41:59.850 --> 42:01.602
the plane will arrive in four days.

42:01.810 --> 42:04.647
This is the last time
you're gonna see me until we have him.

42:05.314 --> 42:07.483
If you need me,
leave me a note at the Embassy.

42:07.566 --> 42:10.194
Otherwise,
no contact in case I'm followed.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.780
We'll exchange money
and documents in cafes.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.075
From now on, every move
you make, and every second it takes,

42:16.158 --> 42:19.161
counts for everything,
so don't make any stupid mistakes.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.621
That's very inspiring.

[Moshe]
What if they call the police or worse?

42:32.716 --> 42:34.843
[Peter] Authorities aren't gonna
stick their necks out

42:34.927 --> 42:36.178
for a Nazi on Independence Day.

42:36.262 --> 42:39.974
And the safe house still isn't right.
I'm telling you. Three days isn't enough.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.393
We're gonna make it work.
Relax. Stop worrying.

-[Peter] Shit.

42:55.155 --> 42:56.198
Poor guy.

42:57.032 --> 43:01.370
I hear the Commies like to use
their fingernails, tear 'em out.

43:01.453 --> 43:05.583
[Peter] Shots of adrenaline
straight after, stops you from fainting.

43:07.042 --> 43:08.961
[Moshe] Think the Argies
would do that to us?

43:10.296 --> 43:13.132
[Moshe] You ever think about
whether we'll get to do that to him?

43:15.092 --> 43:16.719
[Peter] That's not why we're here.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.304
[Moshe] Come on, Habibi.

43:18.804 --> 43:21.473
You're telling me
that after what that fuck did to us,

43:21.557 --> 43:24.810
you didn't want someone here ready
and willing to make him scream?

43:28.355 --> 43:31.317

[Ilani] ...and never return to
the same store in the same day.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.459
You'll work in shifts.

-My father...
-[Ilani] Graciela?

43:51.670 --> 43:54.131
My father said we'd be paid?

43:55.507 --> 43:57.968
Expenses only, I'm afraid.

43:59.011 --> 44:03.140
The real reward will be
when Rabbi Levy dedicates a hymn to you.

44:04.558 --> 44:08.103

His son. Beautiful little boy.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.730
They were watching the trains go by.

47:04.696 --> 47:06.114
We're gonna get him.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.835
He needs catching first.

47:24.383 --> 47:27.761
MAY 11TH, 1960

47:49.741 --> 47:51.243
[exhales]

47:52.286 --> 47:53.745
[exhales]

47:56.290 --> 47:57.583
[exhales]

47:57.833 --> 47:58.876
[sighs]

48:19.605 --> 48:22.816
[indistinct chatter]

49:38.725 --> 49:41.353
-[man 1 in Spanish] Need any help?
-[man 2 in Spanish] No, thank you.

49:41.436 --> 49:42.312
[man 3] No.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.106
[thunder rumbles]

49:48.527 --> 49:50.028
Who the hell was that?

49:52.197 --> 49:53.865
You ever seen that guy before?

49:54.241 --> 49:55.492
[Peter] Here he comes.

49:57.202 --> 49:58.036
[bus approaches]

50:04.334 --> 50:06.003
I don't wanna touch his mouth.

50:12.342 --> 50:13.885
[brakes screech]

50:34.489 --> 50:36.742
-[Peter] Where is he?
-[Rafi] Shit. He knows. He must know.

50:36.825 --> 50:37.951
[Aharoni] We need to leave.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.328
His wife and kid are home.
He wouldn't leave without them.

50:40.412 --> 50:42.622
-[Rafi] He's done it before.
-We have to warn the others.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.041
Let's go. Let's go!

50:53.508 --> 50:54.718
[bus driving]

50:58.513 --> 50:59.389
Look.

51:07.105 --> 51:08.607
[brakes screech]

51:13.737 --> 51:15.447
[bus accelerates]

51:31.630 --> 51:32.464
Him..

51:34.549 --> 51:37.302
-[Moshe] It's him.
-[Aharoni] Why is there a second bus?

51:38.345 --> 51:41.098
And that cyclist.
I don't know, something feels off.

51:44.434 --> 51:45.477
Your call.

51:47.270 --> 51:48.396
Start the engine.

51:50.690 --> 51:52.526
[thunder rumbles]

51:52.609 --> 51:54.152
[Peter whispering in Spanish]

51:56.655 --> 51:58.073
[whispering in Spanish]

52:09.709 --> 52:11.503
[whispering in Spanish]

52:19.469 --> 52:21.179
[Peter speaking in Spanish]

52:23.974 --> 52:26.685
-[thunder rumbles]
-[Eichmann grunts]

52:27.727 --> 52:28.645
[Eichmann groans]

52:31.982 --> 52:34.401
[grunts continue]

52:35.110 --> 52:36.361
[screams] Ah!

52:42.742 --> 52:44.035
[grunts]

52:54.796 --> 52:56.381
[grunts]

52:59.467 --> 53:01.636
[grunts continue]

53:04.014 --> 53:05.390
[Hanna] Ah.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.059
[Hanna grunts]

53:08.435 --> 53:11.229
-Get the sedative. I got him.
-Make a sound and I'll kill you.

53:12.522 --> 53:14.733
[Peter] Just be quiet,
you'll be all right.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.403
[driver] Hang on!

53:27.370 --> 53:29.080
[Rafi] Okay. Let's go.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.259
[Peter] Cover his hands.

54:29.849 --> 54:32.435
[guard speaking Spanish]
Diplomatic plates. Wave them through.

54:32.644 --> 54:34.813
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

55:28.575 --> 55:31.536
If you speak without
being spoken to, you will be gagged.

55:35.123 --> 55:36.624
Open your eyes.

55:50.597 --> 55:52.515
I want you to tell me your name.

55:55.477 --> 55:58.396
[Eichmann] My name is Ricardo Klement.
I'm a Jew from Palestine.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.481
No, you're not.

55:59.564 --> 56:01.566
[Eichmann] I was born in Serona,
the German quarter.

56:01.649 --> 56:03.193
I know my prayers. Listen.

56:03.276 --> 56:04.110
Tell me your name.

56:04.194 --> 56:08.156
Shma Yisrael,
adonai elohenu, adonai echad.

56:10.325 --> 56:11.326
[Eichmann] You see?

56:12.869 --> 56:14.287
You've made a mistake.

56:14.954 --> 56:16.039
[chuckles]

56:18.500 --> 56:21.086
Drop me anywhere. Blindfold me.

56:21.836 --> 56:23.713
I won't tell anyone what you've done.

56:25.507 --> 56:27.258
[in Hebrew] Where did you live?

56:28.885 --> 56:30.970
I'll admit I'm a little rusty.

56:31.763 --> 56:35.308
You were born in Solingen in 1906.

56:35.850 --> 56:37.685
Your father was named Adolf.

56:38.269 --> 56:41.356
-Your mother Maria Shefferling.
-I don't know those names.

56:43.358 --> 56:45.485
It's not true.
My surname's Klement.

56:45.568 --> 56:48.571
Yet the boy you raise has
the name Eichmann, does he not?

56:48.655 --> 56:50.824
His father died during the war.

56:52.283 --> 56:55.537
So, you let another man's progeny
call you father.

57:00.291 --> 57:01.918
What is your current profession?

57:02.001 --> 57:03.586
Foreman. Mercedes Benz factory.

57:03.670 --> 57:06.131
-Current address.
-14 Garibaldi Street.

57:06.214 --> 57:07.632
-What is--
-What is your wife's name?

57:07.715 --> 57:09.384
Vera. Vera Liebl.

57:09.467 --> 57:11.928
Who is your son Klaus's father?
What is your name?

57:13.430 --> 57:14.931
I am Ricardo Klement.

57:15.932 --> 57:18.685
So, you raise another man's child,

57:18.768 --> 57:20.895
but you feel only obligation, correct?

57:21.980 --> 57:24.065
Should something happen to him, like,

57:24.732 --> 57:27.444
oh, I don't know,
let's say he should suddenly...

57:29.279 --> 57:30.905
disappear tomorrow,

57:32.198 --> 57:33.825
a part of you wouldn't care?

57:39.289 --> 57:42.083
You once had a mistress
named Maria Masenbucher.

57:42.167 --> 57:44.502
-Did you not?
-Not that I recall.

57:45.420 --> 57:48.006
That's interesting,
because she gave us a picture.

57:55.597 --> 57:57.724
Do you recognize the man
in this picture?

58:00.101 --> 58:01.686
I can't see him clearly.

58:02.103 --> 58:03.646
Who has his glasses?

58:11.821 --> 58:14.032
The man in this picture is you.

58:14.616 --> 58:18.745
SS number 45381.
Am I correct?

58:21.873 --> 58:26.127
Again. Your number was 45381.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.923
[Aharoni] Your number was 45381.

58:30.006 --> 58:34.010
45381. 45381!

58:34.093 --> 58:37.013
It was 4-5-3-2-6.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.317
Enough. I accept my fate.

58:51.986 --> 58:53.988
My name is Adolf Eichmann.

59:00.453 --> 59:02.038
-L'Chaim.
-L'Chaim.

59:02.121 --> 59:03.998
-L'Chaim.
-[all] L'Chaim.

59:04.082 --> 59:05.583
[cheering and chuckles]

59:05.833 --> 59:08.127
-[Rafi] All right.
-[Hanna laughs]

59:08.378 --> 59:10.004
[more chuckles and laughs]

59:10.380 --> 59:12.465
[Rafi] Enjoy. We pack up after dinner.

59:13.508 --> 59:14.467
What's wrong?

59:16.219 --> 59:17.470
[Peter] We've got him.

59:19.556 --> 59:20.390
Peace?

59:23.059 --> 59:28.231
My mama spends her days in a dark
apartment alone,

59:28.773 --> 59:30.817
because of what men like him have done.

59:31.985 --> 59:34.320
When she can see the look on
Eichmann's face

59:34.404 --> 59:36.906
when he finds himself in a country
full of us,

59:37.865 --> 59:39.325
that's when I'll have peace.

59:44.914 --> 59:48.001
Come on, Klaus.
Rack your brain. Who knew?

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:02.515
[loud knocking]

1:00:03.016 --> 1:00:05.393
[dog barking]

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:08.646
-[officer] Lothar Hermann?
-[in Spanish] Yes.

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:10.481
[officer in Spanish]
Is your daughter home?

1:00:11.065 --> 1:00:12.817
[Lothar in Spanish]
She's out of the country.

1:00:13.276 --> 1:00:14.819
[officer in Spanish] Take him.

1:00:14.902 --> 1:00:17.238
[Lothar speaking in Spanish]

1:00:17.322 --> 1:00:18.573
[Lothar speaking Spanish]

1:00:18.656 --> 1:00:22.035
[car motoring away]

1:00:24.245 --> 1:00:26.331
[airport worker speaking in Spanish]

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:29.876
[Ilani in Spanish] Is the plane ready?

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:31.669
[in Spanish] I've got bad news.

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:35.882
[Peter] All right, let's get changed
and get out of here.

1:00:35.965 --> 1:00:37.300
[Ilani] Listen everyone.

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:40.345
[door opens and closes]

1:00:41.763 --> 1:00:43.097
There is a problem
with the flight.

1:00:43.181 --> 1:00:44.349
-[Peter] What?
-[Harel] What?

1:00:44.682 --> 1:00:46.684
The airport says it's delayed by ten days.

1:00:46.768 --> 1:00:49.312
-Nobody knows.
-[Peter] Shit. Ten days! Oh, shit.

1:00:50.229 --> 1:00:53.399
It's coincidence.
It's too soon for anyone to know.

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:55.652
-Not if they found the glasses.
-[Aharoni] They know.

1:00:55.735 --> 1:01:00.657
[Rafi] Okay. Ephraim, tomorrow morning
you and Moshe, you return the cars.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:03.159
If they quibble about damages,
you pay whatever they say.

1:01:03.242 --> 1:01:05.119
-[Ilani] We'll need money.
-I'll take care of it.

1:01:05.203 --> 1:01:07.955
We're gonna need to watch him
24 hours a day. We'll do it in shifts.

1:01:08.039 --> 1:01:09.666
Now you need us in the room with him?

1:01:09.749 --> 1:01:11.834
He could swallow his tongue,
try to hang himself.

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:14.045
We're not gonna let him get out of this.
Understood?

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:17.507
[Rafi] Aharoni's the only one
who speaks to him.

1:01:17.590 --> 1:01:20.343
If you have something to say,
keep it to yourself. Got it?

1:01:20.426 --> 1:01:21.803
[Moshe] And if they find us?

1:01:22.303 --> 1:01:24.138
We're not just gonna let him go, are we?

1:01:24.222 --> 1:01:25.306
[Rafi] Hey. Shh.

1:01:25.390 --> 1:01:28.518
-Quiet. He can hear everything.
-[Peter] We have him.

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:34.774
Now we just lay low, play the
"who's the worst cook than Rafi?" game.

1:01:34.857 --> 1:01:36.734
-Mm-hmm.
-[Peter] Hard part's over.

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:47.578
[birds chirping]

1:01:50.164 --> 1:01:51.416
[loud clunk]

1:02:04.595 --> 1:02:06.347
[bed rattles]

1:02:30.037 --> 1:02:32.206
[vapor escaping]

1:03:12.413 --> 1:03:15.583
[indistinct chatter]

1:03:25.927 --> 1:03:29.222
[Rafi] Germany issued an extradition
request a few months back

1:03:29.347 --> 1:03:31.265
and they suspect he's hiding here, too.

1:03:31.349 --> 1:03:33.768
[Harel] Okay.  From now on,
nobody leave this house.

1:03:33.851 --> 1:03:36.729
-[Aharoni] That's right. We all sit tight.
-[Hanna] A scared old blind man.

1:03:36.813 --> 1:03:39.232
-It's our fault they got him.
-[Peter] What are you doing here?

1:03:39.315 --> 1:03:41.150
[Hanna] Peter, listen to this. [sighs]

1:03:42.610 --> 1:03:46.322
The police arrested Lothar Hermann,
claiming he's Joseph Mengele.

1:03:46.405 --> 1:03:48.366
-Joseph Mengele.
-[Rafi] Yeah.

1:03:48.449 --> 1:03:49.951
The angel of death himself.

1:03:50.034 --> 1:03:52.370
-[Hanna] This is a bad joke.
-This is Fuldner's people.

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:53.830
They're using him as bait.

1:03:53.913 --> 1:03:56.833
[Harel] It's worse than that.
El Al is refusing to send a plane.

1:03:57.208 --> 1:03:59.085
They say first
they need something from us.

1:04:00.586 --> 1:04:04.507
A signed document from Eichmann
saying he'll willingly come to Israel.

1:04:04.590 --> 1:04:05.424
[Peter] What?

1:04:05.508 --> 1:04:07.468
-They're out of their minds.
-Enough!

1:04:10.555 --> 1:04:12.014
Can't we have Dani fake it?

1:04:12.098 --> 1:04:14.600
No, we have no idea
what his signature looks like.

1:04:14.684 --> 1:04:15.518
Aharoni.

1:04:17.353 --> 1:04:19.355
Can you squeeze a signature out of him?

1:04:20.731 --> 1:04:21.858
Can you?

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:23.192
Of course, yeah.

1:04:24.277 --> 1:04:27.947
Well, he's going to need to read it.
Did you replace the glasses that you lost?

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:34.537
Thank you. For these.

1:04:37.456 --> 1:04:38.541
[Eichmann] I'm grateful.

1:04:52.471 --> 1:04:55.892
You want me to stand trial
in place of an entire regime?

1:04:56.392 --> 1:04:58.519
I'm offering you a fair trial.

1:04:58.686 --> 1:05:02.690
If these are German crimes,
they should be tried in German courts.

1:05:04.483 --> 1:05:07.737
-That's not an option.
-Ask your superiors to negotiate.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:09.864
If they refuse, I do, too.

1:05:10.948 --> 1:05:12.950
I've no desire to be your scapegoat.

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:17.663
I'd argue the Architect of the Final
Solution has plenty to answer for.

1:05:18.247 --> 1:05:22.710
The Architect... of the Final Solution.

1:05:22.793 --> 1:05:25.588
-Do you deny your title?
-We love nicknames.

1:05:27.214 --> 1:05:29.175
They used to call me the Little Jew.

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:31.052
Did you know that?

1:05:34.221 --> 1:05:35.973
I read about Nuremberg.

1:05:37.475 --> 1:05:40.686
Those swine, Wisliceny and Höttl.

1:05:42.188 --> 1:05:44.398
Blaming the absent to escape the noose.

1:05:44.482 --> 1:05:47.360
Well, then refute them. Come to Israel.

1:05:47.860 --> 1:05:49.570
Make your case to the world.

1:05:51.447 --> 1:05:53.115
I would rather die...

1:05:53.783 --> 1:05:57.745
than have my history told the way
someone else would like it to have been.

1:05:59.163 --> 1:06:01.874
You have no interest
in what I have to say,

1:06:02.375 --> 1:06:05.086
unless it confirms
what you think you already know.

1:06:06.379 --> 1:06:09.799
[Aharoni] Tell me, what is it
that I think I already know?

1:06:10.341 --> 1:06:11.801
The...

1:06:14.553 --> 1:06:16.639
-May I have a cigarette?
-You may not.

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:23.312
[Eichmann] The exact consequences
of my work were kept hidden from me.

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:26.440
I was merely a cog in a machine...

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:29.318
-[indistinct chatter]
-...digging its way to hell.

1:06:31.779 --> 1:06:35.741
By the end, I was chained to my desk.

1:06:36.242 --> 1:06:37.827
Twenty hours a day.

1:06:40.204 --> 1:06:42.164
My job was simple.

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:45.710
Save the country I love
from being destroyed.

1:06:48.254 --> 1:06:50.006
Is your job any different?

1:06:52.466 --> 1:06:56.053
But none of what I say matters.
Your lawyers and your lying press

1:06:57.054 --> 1:07:00.766
will try the man they think they know,
not the one who sits before you now.

1:07:08.816 --> 1:07:11.444
[Rafi] Forty, sixty, eighty, five hundred.

1:07:11.986 --> 1:07:13.070
Okay.

1:07:16.365 --> 1:07:17.199
Graciela?

1:07:21.495 --> 1:07:22.747
-[Rafi] Eh...
-Si?

1:07:23.414 --> 1:07:24.665
[Rafi] Uh, groceries.

1:07:38.596 --> 1:07:40.139
[Aharoni] Can someone else feed him?

1:07:40.222 --> 1:07:42.099
-[Moshe] It's your turn.
-[Aharoni] I know.

1:07:43.267 --> 1:07:46.062
I'm... I'm asking for a favor.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:07:59.575
[chewing]

1:08:00.326 --> 1:08:01.368
[inhales]

1:08:02.203 --> 1:08:03.829
[inhales heavily]

1:08:12.797 --> 1:08:13.881
[clears throat]

1:08:15.049 --> 1:08:16.300
[inhales]

1:08:18.427 --> 1:08:20.429
[chewing]

1:08:30.481 --> 1:08:31.690
[Peter] All done.

1:08:35.402 --> 1:08:37.905
You're the man who grabbed me.
I know your voice.

1:08:42.118 --> 1:08:43.077
Yes.

1:08:46.413 --> 1:08:49.250
Please, just tell me.
My family, are they safe?

1:09:08.269 --> 1:09:12.731
-[church bells toll]
-[doves chirping]

1:09:15.526 --> 1:09:17.069
[Klaus] You said you had news.

1:09:20.156 --> 1:09:23.742
Do you know the number of people
buried here because they wouldn't listen?

1:09:23.826 --> 1:09:26.203
Everyone should visit this place
once in a while

1:09:26.287 --> 1:09:32.126
to remember things can go the wrong way
if you don't behave the proper way.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.213
Two Jews returned a rented Buick
to a shop near Acassuso.

1:09:36.797 --> 1:09:38.883
[Carlos] They paid for it in US dollars,

1:09:39.508 --> 1:09:41.385
but the vendor called the police

1:09:41.468 --> 1:09:44.638
when he saw the license plate
had been tampered with.

1:09:44.722 --> 1:09:46.974
-And the rental documents?
-We don't know.

1:09:47.057 --> 1:09:48.976
Their identification was forged.

1:09:49.852 --> 1:09:51.729
We'll talk to shopkeepers.

1:09:51.812 --> 1:09:55.524
If so much as an empanada is paid for
in dollars, I want us to know.

1:10:00.321 --> 1:10:01.989
[Peter] It's too tight.

1:10:02.072 --> 1:10:04.700
[Ilani] Don't any of them come
with some actual shape to them?

1:10:05.576 --> 1:10:08.579
-Is there any medium? Okay.
-[Harel] We are running out of time.

1:10:08.662 --> 1:10:10.122
[Harel] We have to get the signature.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:11.707
[Aharoni] He's being belligerent.

1:10:11.790 --> 1:10:14.501
The problem is he's
got no incentive to sign it.

1:10:14.585 --> 1:10:17.296
If the easy way doesn't work,
do it the hard way.

1:10:17.379 --> 1:10:18.631
You have my permission.

1:10:18.714 --> 1:10:23.344
This guy convinced rabbis
to load the trains themselves.

1:10:23.886 --> 1:10:25.095
[Peter] And not by force.

1:10:26.722 --> 1:10:29.475
You can't strong arm a guy like that,

1:10:30.142 --> 1:10:34.730
but if we can relate to him,
if you appeal to his--

1:10:34.813 --> 1:10:35.773
Humanity?

1:10:36.690 --> 1:10:40.653
His ego makes him feel like
he's in control.

1:10:40.736 --> 1:10:43.906
I appreciate you're trying to help,
but he's as slippery as they come.

1:10:43.989 --> 1:10:48.619
Spots tricks a mile away.
This only works if we wear him down.

1:10:48.702 --> 1:10:50.996
If he knows there's no escape,
eventually he'll yield.

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:52.957
-That's not working.
-You've done your job.

1:10:53.499 --> 1:10:55.000
Will you leave me to do mine?

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:11.850
[Eichmann] Let's put the shoe
on your foot, shall we?

1:11:12.434 --> 1:11:15.271
You're a soldier ordered
to make me sign this,

1:11:15.354 --> 1:11:18.732
but are you or your superiors
responsible for that order?

1:11:22.194 --> 1:11:24.280
I'm offering you a fair trial.

1:11:34.915 --> 1:11:36.000
[banging]

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:37.167
[sigh]

1:11:38.919 --> 1:11:40.170
[banging continues]

1:11:45.342 --> 1:11:47.886
[Eichmann] Herr Captor,
I need the lavatory, please.

1:11:48.470 --> 1:11:51.640
It's quite serious.

1:11:57.313 --> 1:12:00.482
This would be much easier
if I had something to read.

1:12:00.566 --> 1:12:02.776
Should we lend him your copy
of Mein Kampf or mine?

1:12:05.738 --> 1:12:10.200
I remember visiting my father
at the Tramway and Electrical. I was nine.

1:12:11.702 --> 1:12:14.288
He introduces me so proudly.

1:12:14.872 --> 1:12:19.585
"My boy!" He says, "This is my boy!"

1:12:20.502 --> 1:12:26.300
So, imagine my dismay when I had to use
the bathroom and unleash sheer hell.

1:12:29.595 --> 1:12:31.555
[Eichmann groans]

1:12:32.264 --> 1:12:35.225
I said, "Everybody does it, Papa.
Everybody shits."

1:12:38.937 --> 1:12:42.274
I think about that still, to this day.

1:12:45.652 --> 1:12:46.737
[sniffs]

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:50.532
If only you'd cover my nose
as well as my eyes.

1:12:51.241 --> 1:12:53.077
[Yaakov] So, this is the master race.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:55.704
Oh, we used to say to be
the perfect Nazi,

1:12:55.788 --> 1:12:59.291
you had to be as slim as Goering, as tall
as Goebbels, and as blond as Hitler!

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:00.626
[laughs]

1:13:14.306 --> 1:13:16.266
May I wipe now, Herr Captor?

1:13:22.272 --> 1:13:24.566
[Eichmann]
My family, are they safe, please?

1:13:30.614 --> 1:13:32.449
-Of course, they are.
-[gasps]

1:13:33.117 --> 1:13:34.743
-What do you think of us?
-Thank you.

1:13:34.827 --> 1:13:36.495
[clears throat]
Thank you.

1:13:37.788 --> 1:13:39.289
Herr Captor.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.130
I wonder if I might keep
speaking with you.

1:13:46.630 --> 1:13:49.675
That Jobnik they send, he won't listen.

1:13:49.758 --> 1:13:50.926
[door opens]

1:13:52.010 --> 1:13:53.262
[door closes]

1:13:54.012 --> 1:13:55.222
[sighs]

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:17.619
Round face, straight brown hair.
Heavy set.

1:14:17.911 --> 1:14:20.539
I want eyes at all major transit points.

1:14:20.622 --> 1:14:23.584
This is one of the Jews
who took Ricardo Klement.

1:14:23.667 --> 1:14:26.003
-[Moshe] Do you want some more?
-[Hanna] No, thank you.

1:14:26.753 --> 1:14:29.506
[Yaakov] Oh, great, beef again.

1:14:30.215 --> 1:14:31.842
I'd kill for a fish.

1:14:32.259 --> 1:14:34.011
[Rafi] Shut up and eat your cubed cheese.

1:14:34.094 --> 1:14:35.596
Why is it so bland?

1:14:35.929 --> 1:14:38.515
-[Aharoni] It's missing the bacteria.
-Or a nice goat's cheese.

1:14:38.599 --> 1:14:40.559
[Rafi] You know
that Lifta cheese back home?

1:14:41.059 --> 1:14:42.478
It's really strong.

1:14:42.561 --> 1:14:45.981
[chuckling You remember when Miriam
made a cheesecake with it by accident

1:14:47.065 --> 1:14:49.818
and you ate a whole slice
just to make her happy.

1:14:50.027 --> 1:14:52.654
[laughing] "No, Mir, this is really good.
Thank you."

1:14:54.490 --> 1:14:56.116
You know, Lifta is an Arab cheese.

1:14:56.783 --> 1:14:58.952
Is it? I didn't, uh,

1:14:59.203 --> 1:15:02.456
-ask to see its papers.
-Oh, this is a joke, right?

1:15:03.290 --> 1:15:05.375
[Moshe] Giving money to our enemies.

1:15:05.459 --> 1:15:07.127
The people who want us dead.
It's hilarious.

1:15:07.211 --> 1:15:09.546
Aharoni, you tried that one yet?

1:15:10.047 --> 1:15:12.799
-See if it works on Eichmann.
-He'll sign. We're close.

1:15:12.883 --> 1:15:15.093
We should string him up
and beat a signature out of him.

1:15:15.719 --> 1:15:18.597
[Moshe] That's what they'd do to us,
but no, that'd be too easy.

1:15:18.680 --> 1:15:20.098
Instead we have to feed him.

1:15:20.891 --> 1:15:23.310
Relax, Moshe. It's just cheese.

1:15:23.852 --> 1:15:25.020
[Ilani] Moshe.

1:15:26.980 --> 1:15:28.315
You're up next.

1:15:30.359 --> 1:15:31.735
No, it's all right.

1:15:32.319 --> 1:15:33.737
[Peter] I'll take his shift.

1:16:08.355 --> 1:16:09.731
[exhales]

1:16:11.233 --> 1:16:12.401
Why won't you sign?

1:16:12.484 --> 1:16:16.446
I'm an Argentine citizen
accused of crimes committed in Germany.

1:16:16.530 --> 1:16:17.823
Don't be modest.

1:16:18.615 --> 1:16:22.119
Lithuania, Hungary, Poland.
You were quite the traveler.

1:16:22.202 --> 1:16:24.371
I should be tried
in one of those countries.

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:25.664
Nah.

1:16:27.874 --> 1:16:29.209
I don't buy it.

1:16:35.716 --> 1:16:39.595
You can't win a war
if soldiers don't follow their orders.

1:16:39.678 --> 1:16:40.721
[Peter scoffs]

1:16:41.263 --> 1:16:43.098
No, that's not good enough.

1:16:44.224 --> 1:16:47.477
-The truth will out.
-What is truth? Whose truth?

1:16:51.356 --> 1:16:54.276
-No one will listen to me.
-I wanna listen.

1:16:54.359 --> 1:16:56.862
Be treated like a dog. A show trial.

1:16:58.030 --> 1:17:00.991
To pin everything on me.
We held those, too, you know.

1:17:01.074 --> 1:17:03.535
The preening prosecutors,
the compliant judges.

1:17:17.132 --> 1:17:19.092
[inhales] My God. This--

1:17:19.259 --> 1:17:20.677
[sighs deeply]

1:17:22.387 --> 1:17:23.889
[inhales] That's--

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:28.101
You look like shit.

1:17:30.354 --> 1:17:31.521
[sharp chuckle]

1:17:39.029 --> 1:17:41.323
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:17:41.406 --> 1:17:45.160
Some of your men want to.
I can smell it when they're in the room.

1:17:46.870 --> 1:17:50.332
-May I ask you something?
-I'm not in a position to refuse.

1:17:53.251 --> 1:17:56.838
Is it true you called the camps
"liquidation machines"?

1:17:56.922 --> 1:17:59.049
Mengele called you all
kosher salami.

1:17:59.132 --> 1:18:02.344
Everyone used flippant terms
for dirty work.

1:18:04.513 --> 1:18:08.016
-To make us seem like animals.
-We're all animals.

1:18:08.809 --> 1:18:10.977
Fighting for scraps on the Serengeti.

1:18:11.812 --> 1:18:14.314
Some of us just have bigger teeth
than others.

1:18:20.779 --> 1:18:22.406
You know I tried to help.

1:18:22.781 --> 1:18:25.951
For years, I got your people
out of the country.

1:18:27.077 --> 1:18:28.954
That was my solution.

1:18:29.162 --> 1:18:32.207
I wanted the Jews sent to Madagascar.

1:18:32.290 --> 1:18:36.169
Yes, dying of malaria is nicer
than poisoned gas. Very thoughtful of you.

1:18:37.879 --> 1:18:39.589
Other countries wouldn't take you.

1:18:41.675 --> 1:18:44.761
But that didn't stop me
from trying. I negotiated.

1:18:45.387 --> 1:18:47.347
With your Dr. Kasztner in Hungary.

1:18:47.848 --> 1:18:49.808
Trucks for lives.

1:18:50.684 --> 1:18:52.811
We tried to save Jewish lives.

1:18:54.062 --> 1:18:55.313
He was a hero,

1:18:56.314 --> 1:18:59.776
yet your people shot him in cold blood.
Imagine what they'd do to me.

1:19:02.654 --> 1:19:04.740
-[Peter] I didn't know about that.
-Hmm.

1:19:06.491 --> 1:19:08.660
That's why you're here, Herr Captor.

1:19:09.202 --> 1:19:11.580
To make me think Israel will listen to me.

1:19:11.663 --> 1:19:14.082
I just always fancied myself a barber.

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:15.751
Your razor.

1:19:17.085 --> 1:19:18.295
The brand?

1:19:20.046 --> 1:19:22.007
It's a lot older than you, I think.

1:19:22.549 --> 1:19:24.801
From Solingen, like me.

1:19:27.971 --> 1:19:29.639
My Papa died in Israel.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:34.728
One of those pesky Jews who survived.

1:19:34.811 --> 1:19:35.687
[Adolf] Oh.

1:19:36.229 --> 1:19:38.023
So, you didn't lose anyone.

1:19:39.608 --> 1:19:40.650
I'm glad.

1:19:41.568 --> 1:19:46.448
I don't know what I'd have become
if my family had...

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:57.709
[Peter] I spoke to him.

1:19:59.085 --> 1:20:00.295
[Hanna] Why?

1:20:01.254 --> 1:20:02.798
I was trying to get him to sign.

1:20:04.049 --> 1:20:05.926
-Curious.
-What did he say to you?

1:20:07.469 --> 1:20:09.304
He said we're all animals.

1:20:11.181 --> 1:20:12.224
The Jews?

1:20:12.307 --> 1:20:15.644
No, no, everybody.
Jews, Germans. All animals.

1:20:19.815 --> 1:20:20.857
Bullshit.

1:20:23.276 --> 1:20:25.987
If we're animals,
he would be in pieces now.

1:20:26.071 --> 1:20:28.323
-He says he was following orders.
-He chose to do it.

1:20:30.367 --> 1:20:32.911
And we are choosing to keep him alive.

1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:36.957
To let him speak,
but not here, not now.

1:20:43.421 --> 1:20:44.631
Keep your distance.

1:20:49.719 --> 1:20:52.055
-[music playing]
-[Peter] Eleven...

1:20:52.931 --> 1:20:53.807
twelve...

1:20:55.183 --> 1:20:56.268
thirteen.

1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:57.936
The boys love this.

1:20:58.019 --> 1:20:59.563
-Fourteen
-I prefer the older stuff.

1:20:59.646 --> 1:21:01.356
-Carlito Gardel.
-Fifteen.

1:21:01.439 --> 1:21:04.067
-El Zorzal Criollo.
-Sixteen.

1:21:04.943 --> 1:21:06.695
-Seventeen.
-[pants] Enough.

1:21:07.195 --> 1:21:09.489
-Enough?
-Enough.

1:21:13.368 --> 1:21:15.745
[pants] Tell me about you,

1:21:17.038 --> 1:21:18.373
Herr Captor.

1:21:19.249 --> 1:21:22.252
I want to know what it was that
brought our lives together like this.

1:21:23.295 --> 1:21:24.462
[laughs]

1:21:25.046 --> 1:21:28.091
How about this? You sign, I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

1:21:28.174 --> 1:21:31.678
Ah-ha. You're striking a deal.

1:21:36.391 --> 1:21:38.226
I'm establishing a trading post.

1:21:39.394 --> 1:21:42.188
But I'm fresh out of trucks
before you ask.

1:21:42.272 --> 1:21:43.440
It is... ha!

1:21:45.233 --> 1:21:47.986
It is poor form to negotiate
from a position of weakness.

1:21:48.069 --> 1:21:49.779
There's an art to these things.

1:21:50.238 --> 1:21:53.325
Always know the man
who sits across the bargaining table.

1:21:54.159 --> 1:21:55.577
Well, now's your chance.

1:21:56.912 --> 1:21:59.247
You sign, I'll tell you anything
you wanna know.

1:21:59.456 --> 1:22:01.124
I would like to offer a counter.

1:22:02.959 --> 1:22:05.795
Your name in return
for my consideration of your terms.

1:22:05.879 --> 1:22:06.880
Just your name.

1:22:11.635 --> 1:22:13.136
Is that asking so much?

1:22:18.224 --> 1:22:20.060
-Dani.
-[coughs]

1:22:20.226 --> 1:22:21.603
[Harel] We are running out of time.

1:22:24.314 --> 1:22:25.607
[Dani clears throat]

1:22:25.690 --> 1:22:27.150
[Harel] I'll see you in an hour.

1:22:28.860 --> 1:22:30.946
[door opens and closes]

1:22:32.572 --> 1:22:35.784
I am so close, sir. He's going to break.
I know he's going to break.

1:22:35.867 --> 1:22:38.078
[Rafi] We're hearing Nazis
are searching the neighborhood.

1:22:38.161 --> 1:22:40.664
I recommend we move Eichmann
to another safe house.

1:22:40.747 --> 1:22:42.791
[Harel] We can't move him. It's too risky.

1:22:42.874 --> 1:22:45.543
Forget the damn paper. Forget
him signing. Let's just get him out.

1:22:45.627 --> 1:22:48.588
It's more complicated that, Yaakov.
El Al is the only way out.

1:22:48.672 --> 1:22:52.050
-What do you mean it's more complicated--
-Yaakov. Let's just relax, okay?

1:23:05.522 --> 1:23:06.815
[Eichmann] Look at me.

1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:18.785
[thunder rumbles]

1:23:21.871 --> 1:23:24.457
I do want the world to know
what really happened.

1:23:24.749 --> 1:23:26.251
But it needs to be fair.

1:23:27.127 --> 1:23:28.545
People have to listen.

1:23:29.462 --> 1:23:32.298
In Israel,
they'll just want to see me suffer.

1:23:32.382 --> 1:23:35.176
[Peter] No, not if they see you
the way I've seen you.

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:37.679
Talk to them the way you talk to me.

1:23:38.763 --> 1:23:41.266
You can tell your story, the real one.

1:23:41.349 --> 1:23:44.811
In a country where my family
cannot even come to watch me die.

1:23:45.228 --> 1:23:46.146
No.

1:23:47.731 --> 1:23:49.441
No, I would rather end it all.

1:23:50.316 --> 1:23:51.359
Right now.

1:23:53.445 --> 1:23:55.780
Please, just ask your superiors...

1:23:56.865 --> 1:23:58.950
for my family's sake. Please.

1:24:04.205 --> 1:24:05.540
Dani's ready for him.

1:24:09.836 --> 1:24:12.005
Hey, you're making everyone very nervous.

1:24:12.088 --> 1:24:14.090
Talk a walk just round the block, okay?

1:24:23.808 --> 1:24:29.564
-[rain and thunder]
-[airplanes flying]

1:24:30.732 --> 1:24:35.236
[heavy rain and thunder]

1:24:48.583 --> 1:24:50.210
[indistinct dialogue in Spanish]

1:24:52.378 --> 1:24:54.255
[indistinct dialogue in Spanish]

1:25:01.221 --> 1:25:03.431
You check the next one.
I'll take a look here.

1:25:08.603 --> 1:25:09.979
[man speaking in Spanish]

1:25:14.943 --> 1:25:15.944
[man speaking in Spanish]

1:25:17.821 --> 1:25:20.573
[rustling, breaking door]

1:25:21.658 --> 1:25:23.785
-[fence hinge creaks]
-[door bangs]

1:25:42.470 --> 1:25:45.306
[camera gears crank]

1:25:51.271 --> 1:25:52.814
Hide him, quickly!

1:25:53.773 --> 1:25:54.858
[Rafi] Go, go, go.

1:26:34.772 --> 1:26:37.692
[man whistles, speaks in Spanish]

1:26:48.119 --> 1:26:49.454
[gasps]

1:26:50.038 --> 1:26:51.956
-[Eichmann grunts]
-[shushes]

1:26:53.625 --> 1:26:56.044
[struggling, choking]

1:26:58.296 --> 1:27:00.423
-Anything?
-[man] No.

1:27:05.887 --> 1:27:07.305
[Eichmann coughs]

1:27:08.556 --> 1:27:10.308
[grunting]

1:27:12.602 --> 1:27:14.229
Peter, help!

1:27:17.023 --> 1:27:20.193
-[banging]
-[coughs]

1:27:20.276 --> 1:27:23.363
[coughs]

1:27:26.449 --> 1:27:28.826
-No wonder he hasn't broken.
-[Peter] All he knows is my name.

1:27:28.910 --> 1:27:31.746
I've just spoken to him.
Is it true you give him cigarettes?

1:27:32.205 --> 1:27:33.122
[Peter] Yeah.

1:27:33.623 --> 1:27:36.918
[laughs] Oh, of course,
he wouldn't break.

1:27:37.001 --> 1:27:40.505
He's getting room service here,
catering to his every whim.

1:27:40.797 --> 1:27:43.800
Did you think for even a second
what was going to happen, huh?

1:27:43.967 --> 1:27:46.719
We're all going to rot in a cell
because of you.

1:27:46.803 --> 1:27:49.264
-I can get the signature.
-Give me a break.

1:27:49.347 --> 1:27:51.057
-That's bullshit!
-[Hanna] Let him.

1:27:52.976 --> 1:27:54.769
-Let him try.
-[Aharoni] Bullshit.

1:27:54.852 --> 1:27:56.020
Let him try.

1:27:56.104 --> 1:27:59.232
[Aharoni] That's nonsense.
He's compromised us all again.

1:27:59.315 --> 1:28:00.400
Sir, I can do it.

1:28:07.490 --> 1:28:08.950
We've got no choice.

1:28:10.410 --> 1:28:11.661
[Harel] Get us his signature.

1:28:23.673 --> 1:28:25.133
-L'Chaim.
-L'Chaim.

1:28:25.216 --> 1:28:26.467
[clink]

1:28:38.438 --> 1:28:40.606
-I think you should sign.
-Why?

1:28:42.358 --> 1:28:43.735
Because I believe you.

1:28:48.323 --> 1:28:51.951
Tell them what you told me,
about the orders you ignored.

1:28:52.035 --> 1:28:53.953
They'll only hear the ones I took.

1:28:55.913 --> 1:28:59.042
You and I both know I shall die in Israel.

1:28:59.208 --> 1:29:00.543
Don't lie to me, Peter.

1:29:04.339 --> 1:29:07.091
Why am I the one guilty
for my country's mistakes?

1:29:08.051 --> 1:29:10.720
So, you would say what you did to
my people was a mistake?

1:29:10.803 --> 1:29:13.556
We were told that Germany,

1:29:14.015 --> 1:29:16.642
our land of hope and possibility,
was being overrun.

1:29:16.726 --> 1:29:19.312
-If we were to survive--
-Yes, but there's a line.

1:29:19.479 --> 1:29:22.732
And you believe you people
have found that line, do you? Funny.

1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:27.862
I've heard the rumors,
a facility in the Negev Desert.

1:29:27.987 --> 1:29:31.282
Do you know a hydrogen bomb
rarely asks the age of his victims?

1:29:31.366 --> 1:29:33.284
That's not the same
and you know it.

1:29:41.417 --> 1:29:43.419
You watch,
they'll cremate my body.

1:29:46.297 --> 1:29:48.800
I don't know.
I don't know what they'll do in Israel.

1:29:49.675 --> 1:29:52.428
And not everyone will give you
the chance to say your peace.

1:29:57.100 --> 1:29:59.102
Whom did we take from you, Peter?

1:30:00.645 --> 1:30:02.146
Think about your boys.

1:30:03.106 --> 1:30:05.483
If you sign,
they'll know you told the truth.

1:30:06.484 --> 1:30:08.486
That you went to Israel
with nothing to hide.

1:30:08.569 --> 1:30:09.612
Whom did you lose?

1:30:09.695 --> 1:30:13.074
-We lost six million--
-I'm asking about you.

1:30:45.898 --> 1:30:46.732
Oh.

1:30:48.860 --> 1:30:50.111
She's beautiful.

1:30:51.529 --> 1:30:53.531
She was more than my sister.

1:30:55.032 --> 1:30:56.701
She was my teacher,

1:30:58.119 --> 1:30:59.120
and parent.

1:31:02.081 --> 1:31:02.999
My friend.

1:31:05.209 --> 1:31:07.420
She had three beautiful children.

1:31:11.090 --> 1:31:12.675
May I ask how she died?

1:31:14.927 --> 1:31:18.598
We think... in the woods near Lublin.

1:31:20.266 --> 1:31:22.351
-I'm afraid I don't--
-I wasn't asking.

1:31:23.269 --> 1:31:24.312
Of course.

1:31:28.232 --> 1:31:30.067
She would have died...

1:31:30.818 --> 1:31:33.070
protecting the little ones.
I know that much.

1:31:33.362 --> 1:31:34.989
I'm sorry.

1:31:36.866 --> 1:31:38.409
I am truly sorry.

1:31:43.331 --> 1:31:44.415
May I...

1:31:46.292 --> 1:31:48.085
May I ask her name?

1:31:53.883 --> 1:31:56.093
-Fruma.
-[whispers] Fruma.

1:31:56.844 --> 1:31:58.179
Her name was Fruma.

1:32:02.558 --> 1:32:06.854
I saw you... watching the trains.

1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:09.774
You were counting the wagons
with your boy.

1:32:09.857 --> 1:32:10.858
Ah.

1:32:12.318 --> 1:32:14.737
Just like Fruma used to do
with her little boy.

1:32:15.821 --> 1:32:17.198
The only difference...

1:32:18.115 --> 1:32:21.661
is that her boy is dead,
and yours is alive.

1:32:31.462 --> 1:32:33.422
Are you a family man, Peter?

1:32:39.262 --> 1:32:40.513
Maybe one day.

1:32:43.683 --> 1:32:46.143
It only gets harder with age. Trust me.

1:32:46.227 --> 1:32:47.186
[Peter chuckles]

1:32:48.104 --> 1:32:51.023
You have a woman, I'd assume,
so why no children?

1:32:51.732 --> 1:32:52.984
I think you know why.

1:32:54.652 --> 1:32:58.322
I think perhaps you worry
that the future will look like the past.

1:32:59.156 --> 1:33:00.366
[Eichmann sighs]

1:33:00.700 --> 1:33:02.326
I hope that changes...

1:33:03.494 --> 1:33:04.704
for your sake.

1:33:09.125 --> 1:33:10.209
[Eichmann sighs]

1:33:12.670 --> 1:33:14.463
I would like to ask one last thing.

1:33:14.547 --> 1:33:17.633
I would like to see my wife again
one last time before I die.

1:33:35.234 --> 1:33:38.029
If you sign, I'll make sure
you see your wife again.

1:33:39.905 --> 1:33:41.616
You swear it, Peter?

1:33:44.076 --> 1:33:45.202
On Fruma?

1:33:51.125 --> 1:33:52.335
On Fruma.

1:34:53.062 --> 1:34:57.191
-[birds chirping]
-[indistinct chatter and laughter]

1:35:06.492 --> 1:35:08.869
You did it. [laughs]

1:35:12.707 --> 1:35:16.961
[indistinct chatter downstairs]

1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:29.974
[indistinct chatter in German]

1:35:41.152 --> 1:35:43.696
[loud gunshots]

1:35:51.537 --> 1:35:53.539
-[car driving]
-[man whistles]

1:35:54.373 --> 1:35:57.334
I'll need to call a friend to
bring more pesos.

1:35:57.460 --> 1:36:01.714
You can wait at my place.
It's nearby. Follow me.

1:36:06.927 --> 1:36:10.264
[loud horn honks]

1:36:10.973 --> 1:36:12.975
[Graciela crying]

1:36:14.894 --> 1:36:18.981
[continues crying]

1:36:31.243 --> 1:36:33.204
[Carlos] We know you work for the Jews.

1:36:33.496 --> 1:36:36.624
If you want us to stop,
you must tell me where he is, my dear.

1:36:36.707 --> 1:36:39.418
[crying] I don't know.
I don't know.

1:36:44.507 --> 1:36:47.885
-[shouting] Stop! Stop! Stop!
-[screams]

1:36:47.968 --> 1:36:48.969
[Klaus] Stop!

1:36:49.428 --> 1:36:51.263
[crying desperately]

1:37:00.731 --> 1:37:03.818
My name is Klaus Eichmann.

1:37:05.194 --> 1:37:07.029
I just want my father back.

1:37:08.405 --> 1:37:09.490
Please.

1:37:10.908 --> 1:37:11.992
Help.

1:37:12.618 --> 1:37:14.620
Help me and I can make them stop.

1:37:21.794 --> 1:37:25.881
[Graciela whispering indistinctly]

1:37:26.257 --> 1:37:30.261
[Graciela sighs and continues crying]

1:37:33.806 --> 1:37:36.725
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

1:37:39.395 --> 1:37:41.021
[man speaking in Spanish]

1:37:46.819 --> 1:37:48.821
[Rafi ] Let's clear the house
of all personal items.

1:37:48.904 --> 1:37:50.406
Moshe, prep the cars.

1:37:50.489 --> 1:37:52.283
-Yaakov, get the luggage ready.
-[Yaakov] Okay.

1:37:52.366 --> 1:37:55.619
-Oh, where's Graciela? Someone call her.
-[Ilani] I'm on it, boss.

1:37:55.703 --> 1:37:58.747
[Rafi] Go get Eichmann ready.
We leave in one hour. Let's go.

1:38:01.458 --> 1:38:04.211
-Okay. Yeah.
-[Eichmann] Time to go, is it?

1:38:10.843 --> 1:38:14.513
I'll examine you
and then I'll give you a shot to relax.

1:38:14.597 --> 1:38:15.806
Understood?

1:38:16.181 --> 1:38:17.725
Sounds very peaceful.

1:38:28.235 --> 1:38:29.278
[Hanna] Sit back.

1:38:33.490 --> 1:38:35.409
You remind me of her.

1:38:38.245 --> 1:38:39.622
His Fruma.

1:38:43.292 --> 1:38:46.462
[Eichmann] I said I couldn't help,
but perhaps I can.

1:38:48.047 --> 1:38:50.591
Her story, your story,

1:38:51.717 --> 1:38:54.428
reminds me of when I was sent east.

1:38:55.721 --> 1:38:58.515
General Müller asked I check
on the Einsatzgruppen,

1:38:58.599 --> 1:39:01.435
the morale had dropped. They needed
an authority figure...

1:39:02.227 --> 1:39:04.021
to reinvigorate them.

1:39:05.230 --> 1:39:07.650
And, to my mind...
[clears throat]

1:39:07.858 --> 1:39:11.904
I wondered if I might solve

1:39:12.446 --> 1:39:13.489
the issue.

1:39:13.781 --> 1:39:16.283
Find a less chaotic manner

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:19.787
of proceeding other than vans and bullets.

1:39:21.413 --> 1:39:22.790
It was horrifying.

1:39:23.666 --> 1:39:27.294
Five thousand Jews lined up
to stand in this pit.

1:39:28.921 --> 1:39:31.507
I had to drink Schnapps
to keep from fainting.

1:39:33.008 --> 1:39:35.552
I remember a woman and her baby.

1:39:37.471 --> 1:39:39.598
She begged for the child's life.

1:39:41.475 --> 1:39:42.601
She lifted it up

1:39:43.310 --> 1:39:46.605
as if she might give her baby to me,
as if I might save it.

1:39:48.482 --> 1:39:50.526
I would, on occasion,

1:39:51.235 --> 1:39:53.737
do such things, an old acquaintance,

1:39:54.196 --> 1:39:56.782
people who might be of use, but this--

1:39:56.865 --> 1:39:58.450
[Hanna] Stop talking, please.

1:39:59.576 --> 1:40:01.161
Then bang.

1:40:02.955 --> 1:40:04.707
[Eichmann] The bullet that killed her

1:40:05.082 --> 1:40:08.043
goes straight through her child first.

1:40:08.127 --> 1:40:10.504
I remember wiping its brains
off my jacket.

1:40:14.133 --> 1:40:16.218
Do you think that's how we did it, Peter?

1:40:19.346 --> 1:40:21.765
[Eichmann] Do you think
that's how we killed Fruma?

1:40:25.019 --> 1:40:26.895
[Eichmann] One can hope it was that quick.

1:40:26.979 --> 1:40:29.940
That they didn't do the things
some soldiers do,

1:40:30.024 --> 1:40:31.483
but then we'll never know.

1:40:32.026 --> 1:40:34.069
[Hanna] Peter, don't listen to him.

1:40:34.153 --> 1:40:37.239
[Eichmann] They'll say my death is justice

1:40:37.948 --> 1:40:40.451
for all the people you lost.

1:40:40.617 --> 1:40:44.621
That makes my life worth
six million Frumas.

1:40:44.705 --> 1:40:46.665
How does that make you feel,

1:40:46.749 --> 1:40:49.460
knowing that she's not worth
the spit in my mouth?

1:40:49.543 --> 1:40:52.337
-Let go of the syringe. Peter!
-Do it, for God's sake.

1:40:52.421 --> 1:40:53.964
Go on, do it you coward.

1:40:54.048 --> 1:40:55.049
-Leave.
-[Hanna] Don't.

1:40:55.132 --> 1:40:56.925
-Make her worth something!
-[Peter] Get out.

1:40:57.009 --> 1:40:58.177
-[Hanna] Peter.
-Leave.

1:40:58.260 --> 1:41:00.262
-Is that what you want?
-[shouts] Leave right now!

1:41:00.345 --> 1:41:01.680
Come on. Do it!

1:41:02.639 --> 1:41:03.599
[Hanna] Rafi!

1:41:05.934 --> 1:41:08.645
[Hanna] Get him out. He's ready.

1:41:37.966 --> 1:41:39.843
[Rafi] Leave the cars. Out the back.

1:41:50.312 --> 1:41:51.688
[Rafi] Moshe, do your thing.

1:41:51.772 --> 1:41:53.565
-[Moshe] Yep.
-[Peter] I got him.

1:41:54.608 --> 1:41:55.692
[Peter] Go around.

1:41:55.776 --> 1:41:57.486
[Moshe] Come on. Come on.

1:41:57.569 --> 1:42:00.030
[Peter] The car's too small,
we're not gonna fit.

1:42:00.114 --> 1:42:02.241
[officer 1]
¡Polícia, polícia!

1:42:02.491 --> 1:42:04.868
[officer 2] ¡Polícia!

1:42:07.037 --> 1:42:08.247
[Moshe]
Go get in the other car.

1:42:08.956 --> 1:42:12.334
-[Peter[ What about you?
-[Rafi] There's no room. I'm staying.

1:42:13.001 --> 1:42:15.963
[Rafi] I'll find my own way home.
Tell me what it was like.

1:42:34.898 --> 1:42:36.817
[officer] ¡Polícia, polícia!

1:42:37.276 --> 1:42:39.820
[officers chatter in Spanish]

1:42:41.113 --> 1:42:43.031
[officer]
¡Polícia!

1:42:45.159 --> 1:42:46.994
[officer] Miren en los dormitorios.

1:43:08.182 --> 1:43:09.433
Aharoni.

1:43:11.393 --> 1:43:14.563
-I should have--
-[Aharoni] No, no. It's all right.

1:43:16.190 --> 1:43:18.025
You got what we needed.

1:43:19.902 --> 1:43:21.278
I just thought...

1:43:22.154 --> 1:43:25.407
I just need him to be there.

1:43:28.243 --> 1:43:30.078
I know, me too.

1:43:31.955 --> 1:43:34.041
Our slot is in 15 minutes.

1:43:34.124 --> 1:43:36.126
You'd better hope your people hurry up.

1:43:36.376 --> 1:43:37.544
Don't worry.

1:43:40.422 --> 1:43:42.299
[speaking in Spanish]

1:43:49.723 --> 1:43:53.560
-[Ilani in Spanish] Hello, friend.
-[security in Spanish] Hi. Passports.

1:43:55.270 --> 1:43:57.189
[mumbling in Spanish] Hello, sir.

1:44:02.736 --> 1:44:06.240
[Ilani] Too much Fernet...
He's a monster on the stuff.

1:44:06.323 --> 1:44:08.659
You have no idea.

1:44:22.381 --> 1:44:24.800
-[officer in Spanish] All clear.
-[Ilani in Spanish] Thank you.

1:44:25.092 --> 1:44:27.511
-[officer in Spanish] Goodbye.
-[Ilani in Spanish] Goodbye.

1:44:41.942 --> 1:44:43.777
[in Spanish]
This is Inspector Rega.

1:44:51.034 --> 1:44:53.287
[Moshe] Take him up.
I'll get rid of the car.

1:44:53.370 --> 1:44:56.498
We have to prevent them from flying.
Understand?

1:44:56.581 --> 1:44:57.874
At your service.

1:44:59.293 --> 1:45:02.796
Radio Fuldner! They're at the airport.

1:45:10.053 --> 1:45:12.264
[traffic controller]
You are clear for landing, 25 right.

1:45:12.347 --> 1:45:14.266
Winds are two, three, four, and six.

1:45:14.349 --> 1:45:16.435
[pilot over radio]

1:45:17.019 --> 1:45:19.938
[controller] Three, five, five,
eight, five, five. This is Buenos Aires.

1:45:20.230 --> 1:45:22.441
-[pilot over radio]
-[controller] We have you on radar.

1:45:23.108 --> 1:45:25.694
[man speaking over radio]

1:45:25.777 --> 1:45:27.321
Quickly, strap him in.

1:45:28.447 --> 1:45:29.865
[Eichmann grunts]

1:45:32.743 --> 1:45:33.910
[Eichmann] Ah!

1:45:34.619 --> 1:45:37.914
[airplane powering up]

1:45:45.130 --> 1:45:49.926
Air traffic control.
This is El Al 4XAGD. NOTAMS checked.

1:45:50.552 --> 1:45:53.347
Our flight path confirmed.
Ready for takeoff.

1:45:53.472 --> 1:45:57.059
[controller] El Al, slot for you in five.
Confirming landing permits now.

1:45:57.476 --> 1:46:02.856
[pilot over radio] flying… departure
frequency one-three-three decimal four…

1:46:04.524 --> 1:46:06.485
Can I speak to you for a moment?

1:46:15.786 --> 1:46:17.287
I'm sorry.

1:46:19.414 --> 1:46:20.916
I lost it over there.

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.836
-No. It's just about you.
-You know that I love you.

1:46:25.837 --> 1:46:27.047
Your pain.

1:46:27.422 --> 1:46:28.423
Your hate.

1:46:30.217 --> 1:46:33.053
-It's a long trip. In the air we'll talk.
-Okay.

1:46:34.054 --> 1:46:36.598
[airplane engines power down]

1:46:38.850 --> 1:46:40.102
[Peter] What's going on?

1:46:40.977 --> 1:46:42.813
-[co-pilot] We have a problem.
-[Harel] What?

1:46:43.188 --> 1:46:45.649
We have to stop,
and I've got to refuel.

1:46:45.732 --> 1:46:49.694
We filed a landing permit this morning
but they're saying they don't have it.

1:46:49.778 --> 1:46:51.029
That's impossible.

1:46:51.113 --> 1:46:53.365
[Aharoni] It can't be an accident.
What do you want to do?

1:46:53.448 --> 1:46:55.909
They're sending someone
to collect our copy.

1:46:55.992 --> 1:46:59.371
-How long's that gonna take?
-Fifteen minutes. Thirty maybe.

1:46:59.579 --> 1:47:02.707
What if one of us ran it over,
would we be able to get back in time?

1:47:04.835 --> 1:47:06.711
[Harel] Can someone from your crew go?

1:47:06.795 --> 1:47:09.256
[pilot] I am not leaving
any of my crew behind.

1:47:12.801 --> 1:47:13.718
I'll go.

1:47:16.012 --> 1:47:17.347
Give me the permit.

1:47:25.230 --> 1:47:28.525
[man yelling faintly in Spanish]

1:47:55.594 --> 1:47:58.763
-Landing permits. El Al. Who do I...?
-[controller]Traffic at three o'clock.

1:47:59.139 --> 1:48:01.141
[indistinct chatter over radio]

1:48:01.641 --> 1:48:03.643
Okay. They can go now.

1:48:03.727 --> 1:48:05.979
Immediately, or the next slot's
in 15 minutes.

1:48:06.062 --> 1:48:08.607
-Fifteen minutes.
-That gives you time to re-board.

1:48:13.278 --> 1:48:18.200
[sirens wail]

1:48:21.995 --> 1:48:24.706
Do it. Send the plane now.

1:48:25.749 --> 1:48:29.252
[pilot] Ladies and gentlemen,
we have been cleared to take off.

1:48:40.305 --> 1:48:41.473
What about Peter?

1:48:46.853 --> 1:48:50.315
You know that I have Inspector Rega
following behind me,

1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:53.652
and when he arrives this friendly
conversation is over.

1:48:53.735 --> 1:48:55.570
[overlapping chatter]

1:48:55.654 --> 1:48:58.907
[Klaus shouts] Let go! Let go!
My father is on that plane!

1:49:00.659 --> 1:49:01.660
[Klaus] Let go!

1:49:04.663 --> 1:49:05.830
[Klaus shouts] Let go!

1:50:31.625 --> 1:50:35.879
[indistinct chatter]

1:50:36.838 --> 1:50:38.256
[door opens]

1:50:40.342 --> 1:50:42.469
[Ben-Gurion]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Knesset,

1:50:43.637 --> 1:50:47.641
a short time ago,
the most notorious Nazi war criminal,

1:50:48.433 --> 1:50:52.562
Adolf Eichmann,
responsible with the Nazi leaders

1:50:52.812 --> 1:50:56.775
for the extermination of six million
of the Jews of Europe,

1:50:57.317 --> 1:51:00.362
has been discovered and apprehended.

1:51:01.321 --> 1:51:05.158
[Ben Gurion] Adolf Eichmann
is already under arrest in Israel.

1:51:05.700 --> 1:51:09.371
He will shortly be placed on trial
in Jerusalem

1:51:09.454 --> 1:51:14.834
under the terms of the law
for the trial of Nazis and their helpers.

1:51:19.297 --> 1:51:22.926
JERUSALEM 1961

1:51:41.945 --> 1:51:43.196
[Peter] All fixed.

1:51:48.743 --> 1:51:50.161
[Mrs. Malkin] Take her with you.

1:51:59.921 --> 1:52:01.172
[kisses]

1:52:05.427 --> 1:52:06.553
[officer] Ticket.

1:52:07.929 --> 1:52:10.432
Identification. Very nice.

1:52:10.932 --> 1:52:12.392
Join the back of the line.

1:52:12.726 --> 1:52:16.020
[indistinct chatter]

1:52:16.271 --> 1:52:18.231
-[officer] Tickets.
-[Aharoni] Peter.

1:52:24.696 --> 1:52:25.697
[Peter] It's quite a line.

1:52:25.780 --> 1:52:27.657
[Aharoni] It's all right.
I'll help you get in.

1:52:40.211 --> 1:52:42.005
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAY...

1:53:39.979 --> 1:53:41.981
[projector clicks off]

1:53:44.275 --> 1:53:47.779
-[child mumbles]
-[woman whispers to child]

1:53:51.199 --> 1:53:54.953
[man] I stand here
before you, judges of Israel,

1:53:55.620 --> 1:53:59.332
to lead the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann,

1:54:00.583 --> 1:54:02.585
but I am not standing alone.

1:54:03.753 --> 1:54:08.299
With me are six million accusers.

1:54:10.343 --> 1:54:15.473
But they cannot rise to their feet,
and point toward him who sits in the dock

1:54:15.557 --> 1:54:17.767
and cry out, j'accuse!

1:54:19.978 --> 1:54:21.813
[man]
For their ashes

1:54:22.689 --> 1:54:27.652
are piled up on the hills of Auschwitz
and in the fields of Treblinka.

1:54:29.612 --> 1:54:31.531
Their blood cries out,

1:54:33.199 --> 1:54:35.034
but their voice is not heard.

1:54:37.537 --> 1:54:43.209
[man] Therefore,
today I will be their spokesman.

1:54:45.169 --> 1:54:49.674
And in their name,
I will unfold the awesome indictment.

1:54:51.551 --> 1:54:56.639
The history of the Jewish people
is steeped in suffering and tears.

1:54:57.515 --> 1:55:02.729
Yet never, down the entire blood-stained
road traveled by this people,

1:55:02.812 --> 1:55:05.356
[voice fading off]
never since the first...

1:55:05.815 --> 1:55:06.691
[Rafi] Hey.

1:55:08.776 --> 1:55:10.904
They say the only thing
Eichmann will talk about

1:55:10.987 --> 1:55:13.448
is what the cover of
his autobiography's gonna look like.

1:55:14.198 --> 1:55:15.742
-You chosen yours yet?
-[Rafi] No.

1:55:15.825 --> 1:55:18.369
You think Miriam would let me
make that decision?

1:55:18.453 --> 1:55:20.288
She barely lets me choose breakfast.

1:55:24.459 --> 1:55:25.793
You gonna go back in?

1:55:26.836 --> 1:55:27.879
I don't know.

1:55:28.755 --> 1:55:29.756
[Rafi] You don't have to.

1:55:30.757 --> 1:55:32.592
Fruma won't hate you for letting go.

1:55:34.469 --> 1:55:36.387
You got him. Remember that.

1:55:36.679 --> 1:55:39.724
-Yeah. It wasn't just me, Raf.
-[Rafi] Ah.

1:55:40.224 --> 1:55:43.353
It doesn't matter anyway.
No one's gonna know it was us.

1:55:43.519 --> 1:55:45.188
History only remembers the tall people.

1:55:45.271 --> 1:55:46.439
[chuckles]

1:55:50.318 --> 1:55:52.528
-What about Napoleon?
-[Rafi] Who?

1:55:56.783 --> 1:55:58.785
[background chatter fades away]

1:56:34.612 --> 1:56:36.614
[silence continues]

1:57:04.642 --> 1:57:08.354
ON JUNE 1ST, 1962,
ADOLF EICHMANN WAS HANGED,

1:57:08.438 --> 1:57:14.736
HAVING BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF TRANSPORTING
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO THEIR DEATHS.

1:57:19.782 --> 1:57:23.578
HE WAS CREMATED IN
AN OVEN BUILT FOR THE OCCASION,

1:57:23.661 --> 1:57:26.080
AND HIS ASHES SPREAD IN THE SEA,

1:57:26.164 --> 1:57:29.667
SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
NO FINAL PLACE OF REST.

1:57:35.381 --> 1:57:38.259
THE TRIAL WAS TELEVISED GLOBALLY.

1:57:38.342 --> 1:57:42.305
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT

1:57:42.388 --> 1:57:47.935
EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY OF THE HOLOCAUST

1:57:48.019 --> 1:57:51.314
WAS SEEN BY THE WORLD.

1:57:53.441 --> 1:57:57.070
MALKIN KEPT THE MISSION SECRET FROM
HIS MOTHER UNTIL SHE LAY ON HER DEATHBED.

1:57:57.153 --> 1:58:02.033
SHE SAID,
"I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T FORGET FRUMA."

1:58:06.079 --> 1:58:08.790
PETER MALKIN DIED IN 2005

1:58:08.873 --> 1:58:14.670
SURVIVED BY HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN.
