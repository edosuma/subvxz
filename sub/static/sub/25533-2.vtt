Ireland's kind of a part of my life.
I married an Irish girl.

01:48.399 --> 01:51.236
So, coming to Dublin
seems like a natural thing to do.

01:51.402 --> 01:53.404
And when you get here, you see right away

01:53.947 --> 01:56.491
that the whole place is filled
with people like her.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.537
Sweet and positive, very warm.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.499
The Irish are famous
for their charm and humor,

02:04.582 --> 02:07.585
but their food never won
many popularity contests.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.380
They were always better known
for their... you know.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.340
But that's changing.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.844
Now the food
is catching up with the drink.

02:16.553 --> 02:21.057
And local chefs are turning the tales of
terrible Irish food into ancient history.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.397
A perfect example of that new direction
of Irish food is right here,

02:27.939 --> 02:31.317
one of Dublin's hot new breakfasts spots,
Brother Hubbard,

02:31.401 --> 02:33.528
run by chef Garrett Fitzgerald.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.406
-Hey! Mr. Garrett. Nice to see you.
-Welcome! How are you?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.323
Come on in.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.826
-I love breakfast.
-Good morning. Very good.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.494
And I love the Irish breakfast.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.537
Okay.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.331
I've a bit of a surprise for you, Phil.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.042
-We don't do Irish breakfasts.
-Goodbye, Garrett.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.963
Garrett Fitzgerald and his life partner,
James Boland, created this place,

02:52.046 --> 02:56.050
and the food is all based
on their travels around the world.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.347
I had a whole different career working
in the energy industry of all things,

03:01.931 --> 03:05.602
and I loved it, but I found myself
spending all of my spare time

03:05.727 --> 03:09.981
either cooking or making travel plans
based around food and things like that.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.484
And I realized that was my true passion,
so I spent about two years traveling.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.196
I realized that Middle Eastern food
really excited me

03:16.279 --> 03:19.616
because it was such a wonderful,
vibrant, fresh, healthy cuisine.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.284
So, this is your eggs menemen.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.661
-My eggs what?
-[waitress] Eggs menemen.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.913
-Turkish eggs menemen.
-[Garrett] Yes!

03:24.996 --> 03:25.872
[waitress] A new word.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.999
[Garrett]
It's a very traditional Turkish dish,

03:28.082 --> 03:30.335
and it was inspired
from my time in Istanbul.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.883
It's really good whatever--
whatever its name is.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.345
I love how travel inspired you.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.181
And it's what I try to tell everybody.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.266
The most mind-expanding thing we can do.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.061
It literally changed
your life, your career.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.439
-And I'm having Turkish-Irish breakfast...
-Yeah! [chuckles]

03:51.522 --> 03:52.690
...which is fantastic.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.360
We want you to feel better
getting up from the table.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.820
You know, you're leaving
with a spring in your step.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.782
-First time in Ireland?
-I was here ten years ago.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.617
-Oh, wow. Okay.
-I fell in love with it.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.576
[Garrett] Mm.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.787
-And you know I married an Irish girl.
-No way!

04:05.870 --> 04:09.040
Uh-huh. She's not originally
from Ireland, but her ancestry.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.792
Whereabouts in Ireland, do you know?

04:12.835 --> 04:14.212
What would be the worst part?

04:14.295 --> 04:16.172
[laughs]

04:16.756 --> 04:18.174
I love a good wife joke.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.970
[Phil] But what I never joke about
is dessert.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.307
Garrett and his team
bake all this stuff every morning.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.768
It would be rude not to eat everything.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.812
-[Phil] Hi.
-[Garrett] Good Lord.

04:31.896 --> 04:35.358
-You were saying about healthy breakfast.
-I know, yeah. So... [laughs]

04:36.359 --> 04:37.902
[Garrett] We call it cinnamon scroll

04:37.986 --> 04:40.863
'cause it's like
the Dead Sea Scrolls rolled up like that.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.617
Then we have
a chocolate and hazelnut babka.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.952
-[Phil] What!?
-[Garrett] Yeah!

04:46.786 --> 04:49.497
Lots of folding going on there. [chuckles]

04:51.666 --> 04:53.293
Wow, going right in there.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.296
I have one thing to say.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.341
[Garrett laughs]

05:00.425 --> 05:02.218
It was an agonizing pause there.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.680
Mm.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.599
Wow, you're really packing it away.
I'm very impressed.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.517

a little country with a huge influence.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.639
Famous for literature, poetry, music

05:48.723 --> 05:49.974
and all around good times.

05:50.058 --> 05:54.312
Around 80 million people worldwide
can claim some Irish ancestry

including this nice lady here,

05:55.855 --> 05:57.357
my wife Monica.

When she heard
that we were doing the Dublin show,

06:02.070 --> 06:03.821
she said, "I might have to come."

06:05.198 --> 06:09.827
We thought we'd go to the new
amazing museum here in Dublin called EPIC,

06:10.453 --> 06:12.747
where you can actually
trace your genealogy.

06:12.830 --> 06:13.956

That's just sad and happy.
That's the Irish.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.160
-That was a great segment.
-Wasn't it? [giggles]

06:51.244 --> 06:52.537
[Phil] But now she's on a roll.

06:52.620 --> 06:53.871
[Irish folk music playing]

06:53.955 --> 06:55.498
[Monica] Oops!

06:57.166 --> 06:58.209
Is that good? [chuckles]

06:59.127 --> 07:01.045
[Monica] Come on, Phil! Come on!

07:01.129 --> 07:03.047
You've got to switch your legs like that.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.048
Hold my hand!

07:04.132 --> 07:05.341
I'm not doing this!

07:08.511 --> 07:09.887
[Monica]  Kind of right, right?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.058
Ooh, switch, switch!

07:14.142 --> 07:16.269
[Monica laughs]

07:17.728 --> 07:19.856
Ooh, Phil! Ooh!

07:21.732 --> 07:22.733
You wish.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.364
Then you get your own person

07:28.448 --> 07:31.284
who can tell you your lineage.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.953
So, we thought we'd give Monica the test.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.248
Okay, so you gave me
a little bit of information.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.834
We're looking for your dad's family.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.837
-So, Robert Horan.
-This is like Antique's Roadshow...

07:42.920 --> 07:44.338
-Roadshow!
-...but with people.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.423
[laughing]

07:45.506 --> 07:47.341
I hope she's worth something.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.845
Your grandparents were James Horan

07:50.928 --> 07:52.805
-and Margaret McGovern.
-Yes.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.973
The reason we know that...

07:55.099 --> 07:58.269
is this little document here.

07:58.769 --> 08:02.899
So, we have the marriage of James Horan,
and Margaret McGovern.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.901
And he's a machinist.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.527
[Phil] So not a Duke.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.820
[Monica laughs]

08:07.904 --> 08:09.197
-[woman] Sorry.
-Not a knight.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.365
Does it say "James A."? What is that?

08:11.449 --> 08:12.575
It does. James A.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.203
-I never knew his middle name so...
-Yeah. James A.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.538
-Be funny if she goes, "Nope, not him!
-[laughs]

08:17.622 --> 08:19.457
Nope, his middle name was Harvey. Sorry!"

08:19.540 --> 08:22.376
Nobody knew his middle name.
Like, we've never heard it.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.588
So your great grandparents
are both born in Philadelphia

08:25.671 --> 08:27.173
on that side, on the Horan side.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.800
But she is Irish?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.052
-She is Irish.
-[Monica laughs]

08:31.135 --> 08:34.263
Because when I wrote
to the mail order company,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.307
-I asked for an Irish girl.
-[woman laughs]

08:36.390 --> 08:40.603
It's the mother's side, born in Ireland.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.940
-I think I'm 51 percent Irish.
-Oh.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.149
-[Phil] That's it?
-That's it.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.400
You seem more than that.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.487
I'm 25 percent Jewish.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.365
You seem more than that, too.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.242
[chuckles]

08:54.325 --> 08:55.576
[in Irish accent] When you're complaining.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.161
I complain, and I drink.

08:57.245 --> 09:01.249
-[laughs] I got the worst of both worlds!
-Perfect combination!

09:06.462 --> 09:09.715
[Phil] Even though Ireland is,
of course, so much more than potatoes,

09:09.799 --> 09:11.842
I'd be an idiot to come here
and not have any!

09:12.718 --> 09:15.930
So there's
an Irish potato pancake called a boxty.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.267
That's kind of a cross
between hash browns and a latke.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.560
It's very traditional.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.228
And there's a guy,

09:22.770 --> 09:25.106
a great chef named Padraic Gallagher.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.734
Padraic is how you say Patrick
in the Irish language.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.946
And like the saint,
this Patrick works miracles too.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.825
In a world of potatoes,
Padraic is the expert

09:36.325 --> 09:38.911
and he has the famous Boxty House.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.873
I brought my newly certified Irish wife
here to try this specialty.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.043
Boxty!

09:46.127 --> 09:48.087
-Hello, guys.
-You're chef Padraic, aren't you?

09:48.170 --> 09:50.965
-Hi. Monica. How are you doing?
-So nice to meet you. Monica.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.675
-Hi, Phil. How are you?
-Hi. I'm Phil.

09:52.758 --> 09:53.801
[Monica] We are lucky!

09:53.884 --> 09:55.886
I believe I should say
welcome home to you.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.638
-Yes. Thank you.
-[Phil] That's right.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.723
An Irish lass.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.433
Galway and Cavan.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.143
Cavan! Well, I'm Leitrim.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.729
-Oh, where's that?
-Right beside Cavan.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.648
It's actually where boxty's from,
so you're really home.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.442
Boxty is something you grew up with.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.736
On Friday, in a good Catholic country,

10:11.819 --> 10:13.654
you had a choice, either fish or boxty.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.199
The fish wasn't great in Leitrim,
but the boxty was terrific.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.911
-I have some beer for you.
-[Phil] Oh, look at that.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.788
-[Padraic] Fantastic. Here you go!
-I'm happy.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.332
[Padraic] This is our own beer.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.459
-We brew this. I brew this.
-[Phil] I'm excited.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.420
-[Padraic] It's called Jack Smyth...
-[Phil] Yeah?

10:29.670 --> 10:32.632
...after the boy that just served you,
my son, Jack Smyth Gallagher.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.216
-That's your boy?
-That's my boy.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.594
-I got to say hi.
-[Monica] We have to compliment...

10:36.677 --> 10:39.096
[Phil] I get my chance because
he's right back out with some food.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.848
-[Phil] You're the boy!
-Namesake.

10:40.931 --> 10:41.766
[Phil] Jack Smyth!

10:42.892 --> 10:43.726
How are you?

10:43.809 --> 10:45.978
-Phil. Nice to meet you. That's Monica.
-I'm Monica.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.189
-Nice to meet you, Monica.
-Nice to meet you.

10:49.273 --> 10:53.194
So these are the three types of boxty.
There's boiled, baked, and pan boxty.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.654
Okay. Pan is a pancake,

10:54.737 --> 10:56.072
the boiled are dumplings,

10:56.155 --> 10:57.823
and then we have the boxty loaf.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.325
The boxty loaf's really good.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.242
This is potato?

11:00.326 --> 11:03.663
Yeah. Grated raw potato,
cooked mashed potato and some flour.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.375
Now you think this is...

11:07.541 --> 11:11.879
How exciting is this going to be?
Until you taste a real potato in Ireland

11:11.962 --> 11:14.131
made by someone
who knows how to make them.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.091
Really good.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.176
Oh, my gosh, so delicious.

11:17.718 --> 11:21.263
We have great produce in this country.
Fantastic produce in this country,

11:21.347 --> 11:24.058
and only in the past 20 years,
we've really actually come forward

11:24.141 --> 11:27.228
and started producing
and delivering it and shouting about it.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.145
Why is that?

11:28.229 --> 11:30.648
A lot of the kids studied
culinary arts. They've come back.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.775
They brought what they've learned back
to the country,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.777
and they're opening small restaurants.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.654
The food scene in Dublin is vibrant.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.697
-[Phil] I know!
-It's fantastic.

11:37.780 --> 11:41.492
It's almost like people all over the world
are waking up to what is around them.

11:41.575 --> 11:46.205
I know. The boxty,
it's a 17th, 18th century product

11:46.414 --> 11:48.124
that I've brought into the 21st century.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.334
-Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.
-[Monica] This is gonna be good.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.877
[Jack] Corned beef boxty.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.339
Thank you very much, Mollieann!

11:55.423 --> 11:56.841
-[Monica] Thank you.
-My daughter.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.386
[Phil] Oh, nice to meet you!
The whole family.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.595
[Padraic] Yep. Yes.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.597
-She's got your dimples.
-[chuckles]

12:03.681 --> 12:06.517
-That's a boxty.
-[Padraic] Corned beef and cabbage boxty.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.520
They always tell us that corned beef
and cabbage is American created.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.273
It is American. When the Irish left here,

12:12.356 --> 12:15.109
they mixed
with their Jewish friends in New York,

12:15.192 --> 12:17.236
and they started
developing the corned beef.

12:17.319 --> 12:20.072
Corned beef is
a Jewish-Irish collaboration.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.657
-[Padraic] Yes.
-[Phil] Hey, like us.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.410
I've got a stew sampler.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.327
[Padraic] Exactly.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.330
[Monica] It feels like March 17th,
I have to say.

12:29.373 --> 12:32.042
[Padraic] Listen. This is the Boxty House.
Every day is March 17th.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.003
On that one, sláinte!

12:34.086 --> 12:35.296
[Phil] To your health!

12:35.379 --> 12:36.380
[Monica] Sláinte!

12:42.803 --> 12:44.513
[Phil] Dublin's got some beautiful parks,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.932
like this one, Merrion Square.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.354
With its big lawns
and the famous two-sided statue

12:52.438 --> 12:54.482
of poet and playwright Oscar Wilde.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.818
On this side, he's smiling
to represent his great comedies,

12:57.902 --> 12:59.320
but he's frowning over here.

12:59.570 --> 13:03.365
It's a little nod to
his horrible persecution and tragic end.

13:10.831 --> 13:14.627
The number one attraction,
not just in Dublin, but in all of Ireland

13:14.710 --> 13:16.212
is the Guinness Storehouse.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.257
Guinness has been in operation since 1759.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.594
The brewery sits at the center of town
and as you get close to it,

13:23.677 --> 13:24.970
you start to smell it.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.767
So, this nice fella, Nick, leads me up
through the storehouse to the tap room,

13:30.309 --> 13:31.936
which overlooks all of Dublin.

13:32.978 --> 13:37.983
You have this 360 degree view
of Dublin and beyond.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.277
[man] So, a nice angle on the glass.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.656
And we're going
to slowly straighten it up like so,

13:43.781 --> 13:45.491
and when we're up here at the top,

13:45.950 --> 13:46.826
we're gonna stop.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.704
You get to take that in with your eyes.
This is where you get to wait.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.623
It's gonna be about a minute.
How's that looking?

13:53.749 --> 13:54.625
[chuckles]

13:55.876 --> 13:57.169
[Phil] Pouring it three quarters,

13:57.586 --> 13:59.880
letting it settle,
watch that beautiful thing.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.842
Waiting that minute. The anticipation.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.135
Let's not underestimate anticipation.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.847
This time we push the handle backwards.

14:07.930 --> 14:08.889
This is the tricky part.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.516
[man] This part
you don't wanna spill.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.352
-You're gonna bring it up to the top.
-[Phil gasps]

14:13.477 --> 14:15.646
Just above the lip of the glass like that.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.731
Give it a moment. Let it settle out.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.652
The head forms nicely on top,
and then it's time for you to drink.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.114
-Do the thing with the lip--
-Actually, stand up straight.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.867
And this way you want
to bring the pint to you, all right?

14:27.950 --> 14:30.661
Get under the head of the beer
into the body of that beer.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.662
There you go.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.421
Yeah, that's delicious.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.423
[man] Come on around.
We'll get you to have a go.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.967
-Look out.
-We're going to put you on this tap, Phil.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.635
Why? Is this the one you don't care

14:46.719 --> 14:49.221
-if a monkey runs it? Okay!
-We've been working on it.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.850
Straighten your glass.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.394
Keep going a little more,
straighten the glass and stop.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.187
[man] Perfect. Let it rest.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.232
-So again, present it to the customers.
-Take a break, people.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.943
You know I did a bit of bartending
for about a month.

15:03.027 --> 15:03.861
I was terrible.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.072
First drink somebody asked me for
was a Pink Squirrel.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.407
-You know what that is?
-No.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.867
-I didn't either!
-[chuckles]

15:09.950 --> 15:12.536
I looked at my--
There was a book, Mr. Boston.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.829
-Yeah.
-Told you how to--

15:13.913 --> 15:16.081
-A cocktail?
-Cocktail. So I went under the--

15:16.165 --> 15:17.499
I looked under "P." I couldn't find it.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.044
I looked under "S" for squirrel,
I couldn't find it.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.838
I looked under "R" for rodent drinks,
I couldn't find it.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.007
Did you find it in the end?

15:25.090 --> 15:28.761
No. I went back to the lady,
and I said, "Can you help me?

15:29.094 --> 15:30.888
-It's my first day."
-Yeah. [chuckles]

15:30.971 --> 15:32.473
"Can you get something simple?"

15:32.890 --> 15:35.559
Yeah, she got a gin and tonic.
I'll always remember that.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.019
An act of kindness.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.687
-[man] Ready?
-[Phil] Yes.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.941
Bring it back in. We're gonna top it off.
Hold it straight. Push the handle away.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.442
Right up to the top,

15:43.525 --> 15:46.445
and just let go of the handle
when you reach the top of that glass.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.407
Smidgen more. Just a tiny bit.
There you go. Stop. Beautiful.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.035
-Not terrible for first time.
-You've done that before, right?

15:53.327 --> 15:55.663
-Not that.
-Really? Drop it down there.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.499
-[Phil] I don't want-- Oh, look.
-[man] Uh-oh.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.709
-[Phil] That could have been a shaky hand.
-[man] Yeah.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.212
The pour was perfect.
It was just the placement.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.546
Perhaps a little off.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.799
But you know, we can try again.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.801
-Okay.
-We do have do-overs. Why not?

16:10.886 --> 16:13.180
Perfect. [chuckles]

16:13.889 --> 16:16.016
How fun is this? Oh, wait I need a break.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.852
This one's ready to top off.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.105
-[man] Oh! Other way, Phil.
-Oh, damn it.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.150
-[man] Very nice. Perfect. Good one.
-Look at that, come on!

16:25.234 --> 16:27.152
-Excellent.
-It only took me four tries.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.072
I had all these extras.
So, what am I going to do with them?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.201
[Phil] You never want
your crew to be too sober.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.286
-[woman] Nick.
-[Phil] Where's your pint?

16:36.370 --> 16:37.579
Oh! I forgot myself.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.790
There we go, give me that.
Thanks very much!

16:39.873 --> 16:41.083
-[all] Cheers!
-[man] Sláinte

16:42.292 --> 16:44.670
[Phil] You gotta try
this meal in a glass when you're here,

16:45.212 --> 16:47.214
and if you're looking
to make a night of it...

16:47.297 --> 16:50.926
I've always been a Scotch guy,
but now in Ireland, who knew?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.052
I didn't know.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.595
You knew.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.139
There's Irish whiskey.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.976
This is called Red Bird.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.520
This is called Red Breast.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.565
Who cares what it's called? [chuckles]

17:09.319 --> 17:11.196
Ah. Beautiful.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.451
Wow, it's like honey, right?

17:16.452 --> 17:17.786
Hang on, people.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.371
This one's near to my heart.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.626
When the guy at the shop showed me
this one, I said "I make my own."

17:33.427 --> 17:36.555
Yeah, that one's got a little burn after--
An after-burn...

17:36.972 --> 17:39.641
that one, but... damn.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.561
Here's another one.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.315
It's called Power's.
This is very popular here.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.192
-Listen.
-[cork pops]

17:48.275 --> 17:51.111
Ah. [chuckles]

17:53.697 --> 17:56.116
[chuckles]

17:56.200 --> 17:57.618
It's the Irish mating call.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.538
That's how I got my wife.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.124
Made that sound
and then she came running. "What? What?"

18:07.419 --> 18:09.088
Irish whiskey, people.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.549
I'm here to say, "Do it!"

18:21.391 --> 18:24.603
[Phil] Booze is always nice,
but here's my real weakness.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.939
This is actually my kind of pub.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.398
Yeah, an ice cream pub.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.442
-Yeah.
-There's very few fights.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.112
Kevin McGahern's an Irish comedian.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.572
He's an actor and a satirical comedy host,

18:35.656 --> 18:37.741
kind of like the Jon Stewart of Ireland.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.992
-Hi!
-[Kira] Hi!

18:39.076 --> 18:42.121
Look at these smiles.
That's what you like in a store.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.330
Welcome to Murphy's.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.331
Thanks!

18:44.414 --> 18:46.041
-How's it going? Kevin.
-Kieran.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.501
-Kieran, nice to meet you.
-Kira.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.962
-Hello, Kira.
-Kieran and Kira and Kevin.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.421
I'm surrounded with K's.

18:52.172 --> 18:56.969
Kieran Murphy started Murphy's ice cream
with his brother Seán in Dingle,

18:57.553 --> 19:03.225
and they specialize in these wild flavors
that are particularly Irish.

19:03.725 --> 19:04.643
Dingle sea salt!

19:04.726 --> 19:07.563
We make our own salt actually
from Dingle sea water.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.647
We boil it down.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.316
Wow.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.528
-That's weirdly nice. Isn't it?
-Yes. That...

19:14.820 --> 19:17.865
Like salt on an ice cream sounds mental,
but it's gorgeous.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.616
[Kieran] Kevin, you know this.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.077
-My favorite. Brown bread.
-Brown bread ice cream.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.662
Brown bread ice cream.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.417
-That's beautiful.
-Yeah. That's the one I always get.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.128
-I just love the bread here anyway.
-The bread is good.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.589
-And that's almost like bread and butter.
-Yeah.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.007
-We're on bread...
-[Phil] Yes.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.049
...this is blue cheese.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.426
-What!?
-What!?

19:37.509 --> 19:40.137
[Kieran] This is blue cheese
from Northern Ireland, young buck.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.097
It's very strong. It's like a stilton.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.350
Let me see your face first.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.768
[Kieran and Kira laugh]

19:48.520 --> 19:50.230
-Weird?
-[Kira] Yeah.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.482
-Very strange.
-You're not ordering that.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.610
[Kevin] No, it's like it's nice,

19:55.569 --> 19:56.403
but it's cheese.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.948
That's like if you were
at a very fancy restaurant

20:00.032 --> 20:02.075
and at the end, they give you a little...

20:02.159 --> 20:03.911
-The cheese plate.
-With the cheese course.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.829
And you'd say, "That's very clever."

20:06.663 --> 20:08.415
[Phil] This one's clever
in a different way.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.500
-This is our Dingle gin.
-Dingle gin?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.712
Who knew gin would make
a good ice cream?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.048
It's like I don't like gin,
but I like this.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.966
-Yeah.
-I like gin, and I love that.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.551
-Wait a minute.
-You like that?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.261
-Is there alcohol in that?
-Tons.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.262
Is that true?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.056
-Yeah, there is alcohol.
-Make it a double.

20:24.139 --> 20:24.973
Yeah.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.393
You must have a lot of fun just kind of
Willy Wonka'ing around the place here.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.104
Have you done any flavors
that, like, haven't worked out?

20:31.605 --> 20:34.191
-That's a good question.
-Experiments that haven't worked.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.400
Tell us your failures.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.485
[all laugh]

20:36.568 --> 20:38.070
A few never saw the light of day.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.990
One of them, we did a smoked salmon
ice cream. It was just wretched.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.076
-Really?
-We learn just as much...

20:44.743 --> 20:46.119
from the failures, Kevin.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.997
-I like that you do these experiments.
-You do, yeah?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.582
-Yeah, it's fun.
-It is fun.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.669
[Phil] And here's more fun.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.257
So you go around the world
just eating nice things?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.549
-Just ice cream.
-[Kieran and Kira laugh]

20:59.967 --> 21:01.510
Just an ice-cream centric show.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.345
-[Kieran] Yeah?
-The sticky toffee is so good.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.639
Yes, it's all right.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.225
It's a good idea,
using the cookie as a spoon.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
Oh, yeah. Of course, people do.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.520
-Cookie spoon!
-[all laugh]

21:20.112 --> 21:22.489
[Phil] Today I'm heading out of town
and into the country,

21:22.656 --> 21:24.533
which is just so easy to do in Ireland.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.703
In less than an hour,
you're in a whole other world.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.589
You hear the name Greystones,
you don't get very excited.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.174
It sounds like a plain place.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.679
And you get there and...

21:46.263 --> 21:48.640
it's on the sea, which is beautiful.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.228
We arrive at dawn. The water is freezing.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.857
And there's a bunch of mental cases...

21:57.941 --> 21:59.443
with bathing suits on.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.908
And they're jumping in the water!

22:09.828 --> 22:10.787
[man] Come on, bro!

22:10.871 --> 22:12.622
[man 2] Whoa!

22:12.706 --> 22:14.541
[Phil] And they do this every day!

22:16.460 --> 22:18.503
And they're led by a pair of crazy men,

22:19.046 --> 22:21.631
these identical twin brothers,

22:21.715 --> 22:24.092
Stephen and David Flynn,

22:24.593 --> 22:30.390
who are the most enthusiastic people
I think I've ever met in my life.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.893
[Stephen] Phil, darling! How are you?

22:33.435 --> 22:34.686
-You're wet.
-You look shocked!

22:34.770 --> 22:36.688
You're wet. You're cold.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.815
Welcome! Make yourself at home.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.609
-It's-- Isn't it freezing?
-No.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.069
-No?
-Sixteen degrees Celsius.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.738
-It's like a warm hug.
-Hi.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.491
-You're all so beautiful.
-Hi, Phil.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.910
-I'm cold looking at you!
-Come on, let's go!

22:49.993 --> 22:51.745
-I'm not going in there!
-Why not?

22:51.828 --> 22:53.830
For me, this would be
like going into The Revenant.

22:55.916 --> 22:59.795
They look like they're freezing to death,
but I've never seen happier people.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.340
-Hi, everybody. Is this like--
-Hello, Phil!

23:03.423 --> 23:04.841
-So, this is your club.
-Yeah.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.718
-This is the team.
-This is the club, yeah.

23:06.802 --> 23:10.180
-Phil have a bar, first.
-Look how sweet you are.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.515
-Caroline.
-Thank you.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.558
-You work with them?
-No, just swim with them.

23:14.101 --> 23:15.185
You swim with them.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.729
-You all live in this town?
-Best town in the world.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.649
The best town in the world. Welcome
to the best town in the world.

23:20.732 --> 23:21.983
-It's official.
-Thank you.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.860
-Welcome.
-Cheers to your health, everyone!

23:23.944 --> 23:27.989
I have to say
whatever this does for you... Right?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.157
It gives you one of these.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.743
You sure that's not
from "I'm freezing to death"?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.121
Where are you from, Phil?

23:34.871 --> 23:37.124
-I'm from Wussyville.
-Wussyville!

23:37.207 --> 23:38.041
[all laugh]

23:38.125 --> 23:40.335
[Stephen] You just not like the cold,
is that it?

23:40.419 --> 23:41.837
-That's it!
-That's it.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.088
That's exactly it!

23:43.171 --> 23:47.050
The cold and the wet! Look! Your teeth
are chattering! Don't lie to the people!

23:47.134 --> 23:50.137
I didn't say it wasn't cold!
It's addictive, though.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.304
It makes you feel good.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.808
You know you reboot your computer
and it works better? It's like a reboot.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.310
You guys have woken me up
with just your spirit,

23:57.686 --> 24:01.440
so I didn't need to jump in.
I just need to see you guys.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.569
This daily shock to the system
is just one part of the twins' push

24:05.652 --> 24:07.112
to make people healthy.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.991
Their cornerstone is the restaurant
and market appropriately named...

24:11.074 --> 24:12.659
-The Happy Pear!
-The Happy Pear!

24:13.743 --> 24:16.288
You gotta try these. These are tomato
the fruit, not the vegetable.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.039
They're sweet.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.375
-[Phil] Fig!
-[David] This isn't just any fig.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.669
This is
the organic French black mission fig.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.671
These are pretty much as good as figs get.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.424
Cleopatra used to put
her sexual prowess down to figs.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.301
Really? You better get me another.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.220
You ready to come in?
Name that veg!

24:32.762 --> 24:34.055
-Smell it!
-Beautiful.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.558
Turmeric. So this stuff
pretty much gives you super powers.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.935
Wait, I'm gonna take a bite,
and then I'm gonna do my move.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.483
Come on. Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.734
[cheering]

24:46.735 --> 24:47.944
Nice.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.529
[man] That's very impressive.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.947
Good control.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.741
Yeah! [chuckles]

24:53.825 --> 24:55.243
-It was nothing.
-[al laugh]

24:59.372 --> 25:02.042
[David] Try these.
These are radish shoots.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.336
Okay, we got better ones in here.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.630
So this is a wholemeal vegan croissant.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.924
We do a whistle stop tour.
I'll be back, get brekkie.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.091
Yeah. We go this way.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.761
[man laughs]

25:12.844 --> 25:14.971
[David] Down this way.
There's loads of little rooms.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.265
I guess it's evolved like an old shoe.
Hi, Lauren.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.975
-Avocado toast.
-And the toast.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.602
[David] Here's the toilets or thrones.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.229
-[Phil] Wow.
-This is the yard here.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.606
-[Phil] Again?
-He's into handstands.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.566
So you're like this without coffee?

25:26.650 --> 25:27.901
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.986
You ready? We show you down this way.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.365
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-That's Marty, and this is Mr. Loveridge.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.616
[Mr. Loveridge] Hello.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.201
[laughs] Hi.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.995
-[David] He's gonna be a famous actor.
-Yes?

25:39.079 --> 25:41.289
-He'll be a famous actor.
-He'll be an actor, this guy.

25:41.373 --> 25:45.293
He's gonna be making out with Charlize
Theron and all that soon. On-screen.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.964
They're so loving and generous
and kind and sweet.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.423
-[David] This is Shane.
-Hello.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.259
-How are things?
-[David] This is Josh.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.679
I'm waiting to meet someone in a bad mood.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.639
It's like a town full of puppies.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.225
[David] Okay,
we're gonna try fermented food.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.602
So this is a two-year-old
apple cider vinegar.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.648
And you'll get a slight note
of elderflower off it. Do you?

26:07.899 --> 26:09.442
-Like that?
-This is vinegar-y.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.902
This is a red berry kombucha.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.198
-That's good.
-Let's sit and have brekkie.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.784
Do you want to have brekkie,
do dips or keep playing?

26:18.201 --> 26:19.911
Because we can keep playing all day.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.206
-You wanted to make a smoothie.
-Okay.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.207
[man laughs]

26:24.291 --> 26:26.626
-You feeling a bit intimidated?
-This is just like my house.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.836
Okay, nuts. Okay.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.298
[Phil] Before I pass out,
we slow down with some brekkie,

26:31.381 --> 26:32.882
which helped put them on the map.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.261
The brothers have actually found
a way to make oatmeal sexy.

26:36.511 --> 26:39.347
They thought if they gave their oatmeal,
which they call porridge--

26:39.431 --> 26:42.892
If they gave that away at first,
it might attract a customer or two.

26:43.768 --> 26:47.188
And it was delicious,
and people started showing up for it.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.774
And now it's caught on,
and they said "You know what?

26:50.317 --> 26:52.694
We're gonna keep giving it to people. Why?

26:53.069 --> 26:55.405
I mean, the business has caught on.

26:55.488 --> 26:58.366
We don't have to do that anymore."
It's because they want to.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.952
-[Phil] I love how you pick up...
-[David] Fuel.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.454
...a little sweetness over here.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.872
This is great. "Nuts about Choc."

27:03.955 --> 27:06.207
It's, like,
our healthier chocolate spread.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.127
It makes porridge a little more decadent
and oatmeal a little fancier.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.545
It's fantastic.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.964
It's taking
basic rudimentary food like oatmeal

27:13.048 --> 27:14.174
and makes it a celebration.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.092
It's like making love to your porridge.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.386
Well, if you two would excuse me,
maybe I'll try.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.764
[all laugh]

27:20.847 --> 27:21.681
Wow, it's great!

27:21.765 --> 27:23.975
I think it just makes
it all singing and all dancing

27:24.059 --> 27:26.519
-and makes it kind of--
-It's all singing, all dancing.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.520
-Yeah.
-Porridge!

27:27.979 --> 27:30.190
There's a famous Frank Capra movie

27:30.273 --> 27:32.108
called Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,

27:32.192 --> 27:36.237
and Gary Cooper plays a guy
who's very happy and positive,

27:36.404 --> 27:38.531
and they say that he's pixilated.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.326
They try to use it against him,

27:41.409 --> 27:43.745
but the whole town turns out
to be that way.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.372
All hail, porridge!

27:45.914 --> 27:48.416
Greystones is pixilated.

27:49.709 --> 27:50.960
They're all pixilated.

28:02.055 --> 28:03.723
[Phil] Now the real road trip begins.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.517
It's a long way to Tipperary

28:06.017 --> 28:07.310
and I'm going way past that.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.858
We get way down south to County Cork
and it's so beautiful.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.568
I got to get a closer look.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.202
We get to this cove, and it's like...

28:25.370 --> 28:28.289
out of Lord of the Rings or something.
I mean, it's beautiful.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.128
It's actually
a personal favorite beach of mine.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.131
[Phil] Sally McKenna is an expert on
seaweed.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.675
She's written books about seaweed.

28:39.300 --> 28:43.888
[Sally] It's got so much seaweed. And
it's in a small, fairly accessible place.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.099
We're gonna forage for seaweed.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.644
What does that mean?
Does it mean I have to go in the water?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.439
I'm not crazy about freezing cold water.

28:53.648 --> 28:57.360
They said "We'll give you these booties
that cover your feet and your ankles."

28:57.444 --> 28:59.487
So I'm like, "All right, here we go."

29:01.281 --> 29:03.700
It's already freezing cold in the shoes.

29:03.783 --> 29:06.286
It's already cold. It's freezing.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.374
I see a lot of beautiful colors.

29:11.458 --> 29:15.170
The seaweed is generally divided
into red, green, and brown.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.172
-Right.
-And it grows from a holdfast.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.507
So it actually holds to the rock.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.384
The way I am with you right now.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.886
[chuckles]

29:22.969 --> 29:25.513
There's about 200 species of life
in a holdfast.

29:26.181 --> 29:29.309
I think I saw a bit of nori here.
Just give me a sec. I'll just grab it.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.144
[Sally] Look at that.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.104
-Have you ever eaten sushi before?
-Of course.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.106
-Well, that's sushi.
-That's the wrap.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.858
-That is what happens.
-They dry it.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.319
-They dry it, press it, and roll it.
-Press it. Roll it.

29:39.402 --> 29:41.571
-But I'd eat it like that. I would.
-You would?

29:42.238 --> 29:44.991
-I'll do what you do.
-It's beautiful. It's kind of salty.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.993
-Good flavor.
-Yeah.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.746
The sea animals
are really, really interesting, as well.

29:49.829 --> 29:51.080
You have the limpets.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.209
-These look like barnacles. Yeah.
-And those are barnacles.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.754
They have the largest penis of anything
in the entire planet

29:57.837 --> 29:59.339
in relation to their size.

29:59.422 --> 30:02.342
So, I'm telling you,
this is a magical world here. A best of.

30:03.718 --> 30:04.969
All right, here we go.

30:05.512 --> 30:09.140
I think this is a place where I might find
a really strong flavored seaweed.

30:09.224 --> 30:11.893
-It's called pepper dulse. It's here, see?
-Really?

30:12.435 --> 30:13.937
Take a bit of the brown bit.

30:14.562 --> 30:15.772
-Yeah.
-It's lovely.

30:16.272 --> 30:18.900
Well, at least you either love it
or you hate it now you've tried it.

30:21.861 --> 30:24.989
-It tastes like a pastrami sandwich.
-It does, you're right!

30:25.073 --> 30:26.991
-It's got a lovely umami beefiness.
-I want more.

30:27.742 --> 30:29.786
[Phil] I'm wasting my time
with pastrami sandwiches.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.288
I could just come
peel some seaweed off a rock.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.873
It's the deli of the sea.

30:34.916 --> 30:38.837
[Phil] Sally plucks more dinner,
and we gracefully return to shore.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.720
-I've got a foot aquarium going.
-I believe it.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.932
-But those are nice and warm, those shoes.
-Not anymore.

30:56.563 --> 31:00.149
[Phil] We're taking our haul further down
the coast to a little seaside restaurant

31:00.775 --> 31:03.528
where the chef does great things
with Irish produce.

31:04.737 --> 31:08.700
Caitlin Ruth was born in New Hampshire,
and she opened Deasy's in Clonakilty.

31:09.492 --> 31:12.829
It's a gastropub committed
to keeping things extremely local.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.331
We're meeting Caitlin there,

31:15.415 --> 31:18.001
and also joining us is Sally's husband,
John McKenna.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.627
He and Sally are both writers

31:19.711 --> 31:23.423
and together they're considered among
the top food critics in all of Ireland.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.758
So you have a rhubarb martini,

31:25.842 --> 31:27.719
and I have a Clonakilty Blonde.

31:27.802 --> 31:29.846
Can I get one of those and a drink, too?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.016
Good health. Sláinte.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.936
-What do you think?
-That's fantastic.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.064
-What's in there?
-[Sally] Raw rhubarb juice, lemon juice,

31:40.148 --> 31:42.817
rhubarb bitters, and a lot of gin.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.527
Goodbye, everybody.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.070
[all chuckle]

31:46.154 --> 31:48.031
This is a pretty part of the world,
isn't it?

31:48.114 --> 31:51.284
-Yeah. It's beautiful. Yeah.
-I see why you came here.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.828
-That and you married an Irishman.
-That's right. Yeah.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.165
[Phil] Listen, whatever it takes
to get a dish like this.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.250
All right. This looks like crabmeat

31:59.667 --> 32:02.629
and a root vegetable I think I recognize.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.756
[Sally] What we have here is white radish.

32:04.839 --> 32:05.673
Yeah.

32:05.757 --> 32:10.553
And it's poached in a kombu dashi made
from the kelp that you gathered earlier.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.973
-So you've got Japanese influences.
-But using ingredients from here.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.601
This must have blown your mind
when you found her.

32:16.684 --> 32:20.355
Absolutely because for a cuisine to be
dynamic, it has to be open to new ideas.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.272
Right.

32:21.356 --> 32:25.026
[John] So as long as you can
kind of reconfigure a dish or think of how

32:25.109 --> 32:28.571
a Japanese stock is actually gonna work
with a West Cork vegetable.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.782
That's when it really gets
kind of exciting.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.326
It allows people to be more expressive

32:33.409 --> 32:35.578
and not to feel
that they're imprisoned by,

32:35.662 --> 32:38.289
you know,
a sort of correct way of doing things,

32:38.539 --> 32:41.417
because the only correct way is
to make it really delicious.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.127
Everything else is who cares.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.171
-It's just got to be delicious.
-That's what I say.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.509
Now, I was reading your article
about seaweed and how healthy it is.

32:49.592 --> 32:53.137
It's got
50 times as much iron as spinach.

32:53.304 --> 32:57.141
It is the original and the best superfood
and maybe the oldest thing on the planet.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.311
During the famine,
why didn't they turn to seaweed?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.772
-They did. They did!
-[Phil] What happened?

33:02.855 --> 33:05.191
But there isn't enough out there
to feed the whole country.

33:05.274 --> 33:09.988
There's an old Irish phrase,
"Pratai, paisti, feamainn,"

33:10.446 --> 33:14.242
which means "Potatoes, children, seaweed."

33:14.325 --> 33:17.537
-I like that children are second.
-Yeah. Children after potatoes.

33:17.787 --> 33:18.621
Yeah.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.629
I'm actually not quite done
with seaweed yet.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.506
[Phil]
I'm going down the road to Cork City

33:28.589 --> 33:32.593
and a little Japanese restaurant
run by chef Takashi Miyazaki.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.305
-[Takashi] Hello.
-Hello! Hi, chef. Nice to meet you.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.598
[Takashi] Nice to meet you!

33:37.682 --> 33:39.976
I'm here with chef and TV host
Rachel Allen,

33:40.184 --> 33:43.104
who had the hot tip
on this interesting mash-up of a place.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.859
-So, you're from Japan.
-Yep!

33:49.193 --> 33:50.945
What brought you to Ireland?

33:51.487 --> 33:52.405
My wife.

33:52.989 --> 33:57.368
-You met her there or here?
-I met my wife in Hiroshima in Japan.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.288
Yeah, that time I was working
in an Irish pub and restaurant.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.123
You were working in an Irish pub?

34:02.206 --> 34:04.375
So were you making
Irish stew and things like that?

34:04.459 --> 34:06.294
-I was.
-Wow.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.212
[Phil] I'm guessing this
wasn't on that menu.

34:08.755 --> 34:09.714
Seaweed tempura.

34:09.797 --> 34:13.134
Now, I eat a lot of Japanese food
in Los Angeles. I haven't seen this.

34:13.760 --> 34:18.347
[Phil] Just a handful of seaweed battered,
fried and served with dashi for dipping.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.016
It couldn't be simpler.

34:22.602 --> 34:24.020
It couldn't be better either.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.647
Mm.

34:26.731 --> 34:27.857
-Very good.
-[Rachel] Yes.

34:27.940 --> 34:31.778
It's so pure. It's incredible, but
kind of naughty and intelligent as well?

34:31.861 --> 34:34.655
Yes! Because the fried, but--
Oh, I love this.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.491
I've never had in Japan this tempura.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.826
-So this is Japanese-Irish?
-Yeah, definitely.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.078
[Phil] It seems simple.

34:40.953 --> 34:44.749
It seems actually so simple
that I'm shocked I haven't had it before.

34:44.832 --> 34:48.628
I've even been to restaurants
that specialize in tempura.

34:48.711 --> 34:50.546
Why aren't they doing this?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.174
This is something you could--
You want a bag of it,

34:53.257 --> 34:56.135
you want to sit in front of the TV
and eat seaweed tempura.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.347
Yes! It sounds crazy. It's fantastic.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.140
So you married an Irish girl.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.683
-Yes.
-Me, too.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.686
Are you-- Does she cook Irish food?

35:06.354 --> 35:07.563
What would I call it?

35:11.692 --> 35:12.610
Be careful now.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.696
She can make, uh... chicken.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.574
Let's move on.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.827
[Rachel chuckles]

35:24.288 --> 35:26.666
[Phil] Now I'm not really sure
what else to do in this town,

35:27.208 --> 35:28.584
but luckily I have some help.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.628
You know, the Irish crew
that we've picked up

35:30.711 --> 35:33.464
are people that drive the vans
with all the crew and everything,

35:33.548 --> 35:36.592
and they say, "Phil, you got to stop
at the Oval Bar in Cork."

35:37.260 --> 35:40.972
Okay. So I'm there
with Des and Tom and Owen,

35:41.055 --> 35:44.851
and I start learning about... pub life.

35:45.434 --> 35:49.188
-Are you gonna have a drink yourself, sir?
-I'm in Cork, so what's the Cork beer?

35:50.356 --> 35:53.317
If you're having a drink here, I'd say
Beamish is probably the best option.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.862
-I got to do it, right?
-You got to drink Beamish.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.196
But you're not having it.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.741
Well, I'm on a diet.

36:00.825 --> 36:01.993
[laughs]

36:02.076 --> 36:05.371
They say just eating and drinking,
then have a pint of stout.

36:05.454 --> 36:07.123
-Right.
-I have to watch me figure.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.291
I'll watch it for you.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.208
Oh.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.877
-[mumbles]
-[Phil chuckles]

36:10.960 --> 36:15.506
I just heard that his last name
is the same last name as my wife's.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.050
-That's right. The Horans. They're famous.
-Yeah.

36:18.134 --> 36:19.343
-Why?
-West of Ireland.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.679
I can't tell you
because you said it's your wife.

36:21.888 --> 36:25.016
-[Emma] There you go.
-Thanks, Emma! Here's my pint of Beamish!

36:25.099 --> 36:26.267
[Phil] Who makes a nice toast?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.852
-I'll give you a couple.
-Okay.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.771
-May the road rise up to meet you!
-I've heard that.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.442
May you be in heaven a half an hour
before the devil knows your dead.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.319
That's a good one. Yeah, I like that one.

36:36.402 --> 36:38.487
-Do you know the movie Jaws?
-I do.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.573
Here's to swimming with bow-legged women.

36:40.656 --> 36:44.660
-Yeah! Robert Shaw! Brilliant!
-[Phil] Yes! An Irishman, right?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.454
-Scotsman. Scottish.
-[Phil] Is he?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.040
You're a film buff.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.166
-Beamish!
-Beamish!

36:50.249 --> 36:51.375
-I like it.
-Yeah?

36:51.459 --> 36:53.878
-There's nothing wrong with it.
-It's nice, right.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.963
-Mind if I have a taste, Philip?
-Please!

36:56.047 --> 36:59.508
-I haven't had Beamish ever.
-You're a Horan so you get what I have.

37:01.719 --> 37:02.929
Well? Well?

37:03.012 --> 37:05.431
-What do you think?
-It's not-- That's nice.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.724
-Yeah?
-See that, a Galway man.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.935
It was a windy answer.
He was afraid to commit.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.104
Dublin people have kind of have
high notions of themselves.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.440
They call the rest of us
in the country "culchies."

37:14.982 --> 37:17.610
So they think
that we're all farmers and all that.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.820
They call us rednecks
and this kind of stuff.

37:19.904 --> 37:20.738
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:20.821 --> 37:24.492
Ignorance is what we call it.
You can take the man out of the bog,

37:24.575 --> 37:27.662
but you can't take the bog out of the man.
He's a bog man.

37:28.537 --> 37:29.830
No. Up yours, Galway!

37:30.498 --> 37:32.333
Wow. We might see a bar fight.

37:32.541 --> 37:33.876
Oh, God. No. We're best mates.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.129
No, no. Here. It's only drink talk.
Only drink talk.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.422
Only drink talk!

37:39.423 --> 37:41.634
-You are dead. I'm joking.
-[chuckles]

37:42.343 --> 37:45.554
[Phil] What you see here
is drivers who are off duty!

37:45.638 --> 37:46.931
They don't have to drive anymore.

37:47.014 --> 37:50.059
I want to make
that little, you know, caveat.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.479
We don't advise drivers to stop in the pub

37:53.562 --> 37:56.524
and have as many as we did
and go out driving.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.441
Please don't.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.656
[birds chirping]

38:11.247 --> 38:13.582
[Phil] A few miles from the city,
you're in farm country.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.378
It's so peaceful here.

38:17.461 --> 38:20.589
You'd never know we were
in the heart of the Irish food revolution.

38:25.094 --> 38:28.556
The first family of Irish cooking
is the Allen family.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.766
We met Rachel Allen,

38:31.058 --> 38:33.602
but the matriarch
is her grandmother-in-law,

38:33.686 --> 38:35.604
93-year-old Myrtle Allen,

38:35.688 --> 38:38.441
who's like the Alice Waters
of Irish cooking.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.694
And there's her daughter-in-law
Darina Allen.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.655
They call Darina the Julia Child.

38:45.614 --> 38:49.243
Together they're in charge of paradise,
otherwise known as Ballymaloe,

38:49.327 --> 38:54.165
a world famous cooking school in
a 19th-century estate on a 100-acre farm.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.960
Chefs come from all over Ireland
and beyond to study here.

38:59.712 --> 39:02.381
Darina runs the day-to-day
and offers me a tour.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.758
[Darina laughing]

39:03.841 --> 39:04.717
There we go.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.636
[Darina] So, this is
the main garden.

39:07.720 --> 39:12.433
And this is a two-acre garden which was
a complete wilderness when we came here.

39:12.975 --> 39:16.812
-Look! There's the message. "Grow food."
-[Phil] Yes, good idea, people."

39:16.896 --> 39:20.483
This is farm to table
before farm to table was a thing.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.195
-Blackberries, look!
-I'm having one. I know these.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.488
Look here. There you are.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.324
The first of the wild blackberries.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.243
[Darina] We are totally-- Look down here.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.499
That's amazing!

39:36.582 --> 39:37.416
I know.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.004
They went out of their way not just
to make it an organic farm, all-natural,

39:42.088 --> 39:44.173
and have
everything you can imagine on a farm,

39:45.007 --> 39:48.511
but to make it as aesthetically beautiful
as they possibly could.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.681
I want to stage a production
of Midsummer Night's Dream in your garden.

39:52.765 --> 39:53.599
[chuckles]

39:53.682 --> 39:54.809
-Promise?
-Yeah.

39:54.934 --> 39:59.105
[Darina] So, we'll go on. We'll go through
because there's lots more to see.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.399
[Phil] Slow down, Darina!

40:01.482 --> 40:02.525
[Darina] Sorry. [chuckles]

40:02.775 --> 40:04.568
And she's a force of nature.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.779
So, we'll go. Look! I'll take you along.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.949
I'll show you the shell houses out here.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.534
Then this is clover here.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.662
[Phil] I could not believe
how much energy she had

40:14.912 --> 40:16.831
and how much enthusiasm she had

40:16.914 --> 40:19.291
for what she does
and her life on this place.

40:20.418 --> 40:24.296
You've made one of the most beautiful
gardens in the world, I think.

40:27.883 --> 40:30.177
-Look at that. Little piggies.
-There's pigs!

40:30.261 --> 40:34.557
These are saddleback. They're heritage,
and getting fatter and fatter every day.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.558
Hello, pigs!

40:35.641 --> 40:37.685
[snorting]

40:37.768 --> 40:39.311
-Hello! Yes!
-And they're--

40:39.395 --> 40:41.230
-Look at this fellow...
-Look!

40:41.313 --> 40:43.357
-You see they--
-They recognize a family member.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.652
[Phil] Hey, easy there, buddy!
This is a family show!

40:48.070 --> 40:50.114
And they're gonna eat this, not me?

40:50.197 --> 40:51.907
Now careful here. There's a wire here.

40:51.991 --> 40:53.159
I haven't done this before.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.911
[Darina chuckles] You're a city boy!

40:55.995 --> 40:56.912
I am a city boy.

40:56.996 --> 41:00.332
-[Darina] This is a first for you.
-[Phil] Hi, guys! Look what I have.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.959
Look! Do you like this?

41:02.042 --> 41:03.544
Hey, hey, pig!

41:04.420 --> 41:06.046
Porky! [chuckles]

41:06.130 --> 41:07.131
There we go.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.551
We're going up to have
an Irish breakfast now in a few minutes.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.304
-[Phil] They have a lot of personality.
-[Darina] They have.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.931
They're like nice dogs...

41:17.016 --> 41:18.184
that you eat.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.062
[Darina] Now...

41:22.146 --> 41:23.981
It's smelling good, is it?

41:25.191 --> 41:26.692
[Phil] She whipped up this breakfast,

41:27.109 --> 41:29.195
the full Irish breakfast in ten minutes.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.823
-These are some scones, here.
-Lovely.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.201
And this is some brown soda bread
I made earlier.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.745
This is the traditional Irish soda bread.

41:37.828 --> 41:40.498
And if you bring that one over,
that's a spotted dog.

41:40.581 --> 41:44.043
Look. This is like a white soda bread
that has some currants

41:44.126 --> 41:46.629
and was considered
to be made as a special treat

41:46.837 --> 41:49.006
when the men
were working harder in the fields

41:49.089 --> 41:51.300
-thrashing or haymaking.
-Like me feeding pigs!

41:51.383 --> 41:53.969
Or when we have a special visitor coming.
There we are.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.346
Good.

41:55.971 --> 42:00.476
Our hens, they eat up the scraps
leftover after the morning's cooking.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.478
And then they come back
as eggs a few days later.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.146
-Yes.
-Perfect arrangement!

42:04.230 --> 42:06.732
Darina's now gonna sing
"The Circle of Life" for me.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.150
[Darina chuckles]

42:08.234 --> 42:09.944
How many sausages would you like?

42:10.402 --> 42:11.237
Uh, two.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.530
Two! Just two?

42:12.613 --> 42:15.074
That's a bit of a feeble effort,
but anyway we'll do that.

42:15.783 --> 42:16.909
Now, here we go!

42:17.451 --> 42:18.661
Sit yourself down there.

42:19.119 --> 42:21.372
[Phil]
Come on, look how beautiful is this?

42:22.039 --> 42:23.874
[Darina]
Now look at this. Sort of gorgeous.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.627
This is honeycomb taken
straight out of the beehive.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.046
-You want to have a little taste?
-Yes.

42:29.338 --> 42:31.507
[Darina] This is a wildflower.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.842
-Yeah?
-It's up in the plum orchard, as well.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.221
Now is that not delicious?

42:37.304 --> 42:40.516
Don't you feel like saying grace
and giving thanks to the good Lord?

42:40.599 --> 42:41.934
-Beautiful.
-What religion are you?

42:42.017 --> 42:44.019
I'm converting to whatever you are.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.523
Darina's daughter Emily sits down
to join us.

42:48.023 --> 42:50.109
Do you eat a full English breakfast
every day?

42:50.192 --> 42:51.026
Not every day.

42:51.110 --> 42:53.404
-You can't. Right?
-No, you couldn't every day.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.865
[Phil] All right. Here I go.
Fresh eggs from the chickies.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.202
[Darina] Sorry, I'm starving.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.913
[Phil] Every single thing I'm having
comes from the farm.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.666
[Darina] Well, now the butter comes
from the Jersey cows.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.751
The honey comes from the beehive.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.379
And then all these breads were made here.

43:10.504 --> 43:11.964
And eggs are from here,

43:12.047 --> 43:14.508
and the rashers and sausages

43:14.592 --> 43:16.844
are locally produced.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.221
-So we know exactly where it is.
-[Phil] Fantastic.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.390
[Darina]
And this is the spotted dog. Look!

43:21.473 --> 43:24.393
[Phil] I'm not gonna insult you
by not having it.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.395
-[Darina] I'll too have some.
-[Phil] Butter, yes.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.439
[Darina] Good.

43:28.981 --> 43:32.693
The bread and butter.
It's just like nowhere else.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.194
[Darina laughs]

43:34.278 --> 43:37.364
Well, in Ireland we can grow grass
like nowhere else in the world,

43:37.448 --> 43:40.909
so our butter and a lot of our dairy
products and our beef and our lamb

43:41.493 --> 43:42.536
are so good.

43:44.663 --> 43:45.998
Mm.

43:48.208 --> 43:49.460
[Darina] Mm.

43:50.794 --> 43:54.048
-You look very happy. You look so happy.
-I'm so happy. I really am.

43:54.131 --> 43:58.761
It's kind of magic to be able to pick
something off a plant and eat it.

43:58.844 --> 44:02.139
And it gives you
a whole other attitude to food.

44:02.389 --> 44:03.891
It gives you such a great appreciation.

44:03.974 --> 44:06.268
And every time you see a farmer,
you want to hug the farmer.

44:06.352 --> 44:09.063
So basically-- Or the food producers.

44:09.146 --> 44:12.066
-I hug chefs all the time.
-[chuckles] Good.

44:12.149 --> 44:13.859
You might get a hug
before we're done.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.195
[Darina chuckles] Promises, promises.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.955
[Phil] They tell me one
of the things I have to do

44:27.498 --> 44:30.084
is go out with the bee keeper
Shane Lehane.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.878
And we're gonna collect honey.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.964
Sounds nice, right? Sounds cute.

44:36.090 --> 44:38.050
Sounds like what Winnie the Pooh does.

44:38.884 --> 44:41.553
But I guess if you're a toy bear,
you get to skip this part.

44:41.845 --> 44:44.682
You ready for your first look at the bees?

44:45.015 --> 44:46.767
Yes. I love bees, I really do.

44:46.892 --> 44:49.061
I'm just scared to death of pain.

44:50.562 --> 44:52.898
Put the hood on,
then you can leave it down again.

44:55.651 --> 44:58.320
[Shane] I can hear
your heart pumping from here. Okay?

44:58.529 --> 44:59.905
Well, it's always, you know,

45:00.823 --> 45:03.701
"You've got nothing to be afraid of,
just put this on, and this on

45:03.784 --> 45:05.577
-and this on and this on."
-Yeah.

45:05.744 --> 45:06.870
Nothing to be afraid of.

45:06.954 --> 45:07.788
Yeah.

45:08.622 --> 45:09.456
Okay.

45:10.624 --> 45:13.127
[Phil] Nice Shane does his best
to calm my fears.

45:13.502 --> 45:15.879
No one's ever been stung
in this bee suit before.

45:15.963 --> 45:16.922
Well, that's reassuring!

45:17.464 --> 45:18.507
Brand new bee suit.

45:18.590 --> 45:19.425
[Phil] Oh.

45:23.595 --> 45:25.389
[Shane] Now... How are you feeling now?

45:25.723 --> 45:26.598
Wonderful.

45:26.890 --> 45:27.975
[Shane] Are you ready?

45:28.058 --> 45:28.892
Yeah.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.228
You can carry
the toilet paper and the stuff.

45:31.311 --> 45:32.688
What's toilet paper for?

45:32.771 --> 45:35.941
-Wait until you see. Very important.
-For when I... [beep] my pants?

45:37.568 --> 45:39.027
[Phil]
Remember that movie The Killer Bees?

45:39.111 --> 45:41.697
-Did you see that movie?
-[Shane] Yeah. It's a true life story.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.705
[Shane] So, light the edge of that.

45:49.830 --> 45:52.541
[Phil] Shane gives me a job
so I can die with a purpose.

45:52.750 --> 45:55.461
[Shane] So here, have a little go
because you'll be smoking.

45:55.836 --> 45:56.879
[Phil] I'm the smoker.

45:56.962 --> 45:58.172
[Shane] Yes, you're the smoker.

45:59.631 --> 46:00.758
Now...

46:01.300 --> 46:02.968
-Well done. You look the part.
-Yeah.

46:03.051 --> 46:05.637
[Phil] I like bees, I really do.
I see what they do.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.098
I know how essential they are
to life on the planet.

46:08.182 --> 46:10.601
I know that the honey is fantastic.

46:10.684 --> 46:12.227
I know they pollinate the world.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.188
I love a bee.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.398
No problem with the bees.

46:17.983 --> 46:20.110
They seem to have a problem with you...

46:21.028 --> 46:22.905
if you go to their house,

46:23.071 --> 46:26.408
and you take the roof off their house
and take their stuff.

46:32.122 --> 46:35.334
[Phil] The bees seem
to be trying to get at us.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.045
But they really seem
to be going for my face.

46:38.587 --> 46:41.673
And they're hitting the screen.
[imitates stinging]

46:43.592 --> 46:47.054
And it's not a nice little calm,
like, buzzing. It's... [imitates buzzing]

46:50.808 --> 46:55.979
What you really need to do as a beekeeper
is learn somehow to just relax.

46:56.063 --> 46:57.856
-Enjoy the sound.
-Exactly.

46:57.940 --> 47:01.443
It takes a bit of time, and I'm impressed.
I'm impressed by your demeanor.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.780
I'm impressed by the way
you're going at this. So, well done.

47:04.863 --> 47:06.406
This is called being petrified.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.409
[Phil] But here's what we came for.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.829
It's a gorgeous frame of sealed honey.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.039
[Phil] Yum.

47:15.541 --> 47:18.293
[Phil] All right. Are these bees
gonna stay here or follow us?

47:18.377 --> 47:19.419
Oh, they always stay.

47:21.713 --> 47:23.423
[Phil] Go back home now, bees.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.512
[Phil] By the way, bees,
if you're listening,

47:28.637 --> 47:31.056
sorry, but I know you can make more.

47:31.557 --> 47:32.432
I know you're--

47:32.516 --> 47:35.894
I know this is just a temporary theft,
but you're gonna--

47:35.978 --> 47:37.229
Don't let it ruin your day.

47:44.361 --> 47:45.487
[Phil] When in Ireland,

47:45.571 --> 47:48.156
you think,
"This couldn't get any prettier."

47:48.824 --> 47:49.867
And then it does.

47:50.784 --> 47:53.245
I was first in Kinsale ten years ago.

47:53.328 --> 47:57.791
I just fell in love with it. It was
the most romantic seaside fishing village.

47:59.001 --> 48:02.379
And the number one restaurant there
is a place called Fishy Fishy.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.466
And the chef owner is Martin Shanahan.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.219
-[Martin] He's looking for you.
-Gentlemen.

48:09.720 --> 48:14.391
[waiter] Today, we have a little taste of
Kinsale and all our own local materials.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.018
[Phil] I am very happy.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.103
Hello, everybody.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.315
Mm.

48:21.398 --> 48:22.274
Wow.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.861
Can you get the sweetness of a crab
and the saltiness of the ocean?

48:25.944 --> 48:27.237
Where from?

48:27.321 --> 48:28.822
About 500 yards from here.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.240
-No!
-Yes. Yeah.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.868
Hee-hee.

48:32.951 --> 48:35.787
Come on, people! What's next?

48:39.082 --> 48:41.001
Okay. Oop. It's fresh.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.254
-This one's still alive.
-It's fresh! Yes! [chuckles]

48:49.343 --> 48:50.886
[Phil] I'm trying
your smoked salmon.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.056
-I think the smoked salmon is--
-Amazing!

48:55.349 --> 48:56.600
-[Phil] John Dory.
-John Dory.

49:01.229 --> 49:02.064
Wow, I love it.

49:02.147 --> 49:03.899
Now, could you say it
for the camera again?

49:03.982 --> 49:04.816
I love this.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.943
[chuckles]

49:08.612 --> 49:10.489
This is the most charming town.

49:10.572 --> 49:13.867
[Martin] And I love the colors. I mean,
the beauty is all the different colors.

49:16.870 --> 49:18.664
-[man] Enjoy.
-[Martin] Cheers, good health!

49:18.747 --> 49:19.957
-To your health!
-Good health.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.792
-Cheers. Good health to you.
-All the best.

49:39.184 --> 49:40.143
[man] Someone's thirsty.

49:40.227 --> 49:41.061
Yeah.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.275
-I'm Irish.
-[chuckles]

50:02.582 --> 50:04.376
[Skype ringing]

50:06.128 --> 50:07.421
[Phil] Ah!

50:07.504 --> 50:08.505
[Max] Hello!

50:08.964 --> 50:10.257
Faith and Begorrah!

50:10.966 --> 50:12.884
Hello. How are you?

50:13.051 --> 50:16.888
Very nice. Dad, can you turn
the lights over your bed on?

50:17.472 --> 50:19.516
They want
the little lights on behind you.

50:21.309 --> 50:25.063
Dad is in his natural habitat.
Here he goes. Oh.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.774
Look at-- It's a-- [laughing]

50:32.571 --> 50:33.613
What's so funny?

50:33.697 --> 50:35.282
Just that it swung around.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.909
Now he's got to swing it back.
That's good.

50:38.076 --> 50:39.369
You want the other one, too?

50:39.661 --> 50:41.121
[Phil] Yeah, why not. Make it even.

50:41.204 --> 50:43.040
[chuckles]

50:43.123 --> 50:45.000
Dad, have you--
Are you playing bridge?

50:45.083 --> 50:46.376
I played yesterday.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.377
How'd you do?

50:48.295 --> 50:49.588
Not so good.

50:50.047 --> 50:52.466
-This woman I didn't want to play with...
-Yeah.

50:52.549 --> 50:57.012
...she asked me to play with her because
she didn't have anybody so I said, "Okay."

50:57.095 --> 51:02.350
Max, I'd prefer if you didn't talk about
the fact you didn't want to play with her.

51:02.434 --> 51:03.602
They put this on.

51:03.685 --> 51:06.813
Yeah. And what's her name,
and do you have an address, maybe?

51:07.939 --> 51:09.649
-[Helen laughs]
-No, no, no.

51:09.983 --> 51:12.319
He likes these two other women.

51:12.402 --> 51:13.737
-Okay.
-[Phil] Oh, really?

51:14.696 --> 51:16.281
Ma, are you all right with this?

51:16.364 --> 51:18.408
Your husband playing with other ladies?

51:19.409 --> 51:23.288
Oh, I'm perfectly fine! I'd even pay them!

51:24.206 --> 51:25.248
-[laughs]
-[Helen] No.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.085
You were in Dublin
and then you went someplace else?

51:28.168 --> 51:29.419
I went down the east coast.

51:29.503 --> 51:32.089
I went to this place
that's a working farm.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.590
It's called Ballymaloe.

51:34.424 --> 51:35.467
How were the pigs?

51:36.009 --> 51:37.219
They were delicious.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.971
[laughs]

51:40.055 --> 51:43.183
I forget. Have you been to Ireland?
It's so beautiful.

51:43.266 --> 51:45.227
It's lush and green.

51:45.310 --> 51:48.396
All the food,
I have to say, has been fantastic.

51:48.480 --> 51:51.566
-My favorite thing...
-[Helen] Oh.

51:51.650 --> 51:54.986
This is sour dough bread.
It's actually hot out of the oven.

51:57.030 --> 52:00.408
But the other thing, Dad,
that you would love

52:00.492 --> 52:02.285
is there is nothing like this.

52:02.369 --> 52:04.246
-What is it?
-This is-- Can you see that?

52:04.746 --> 52:05.956
-[Helen] Butter.
-[Max] Butter?

52:06.039 --> 52:07.374
But you see how yellow it is?

52:07.916 --> 52:08.834
[both] Yes.

52:08.917 --> 52:13.797
And I'm telling you, I'll put this butter
up against any butter anywhere.

52:15.298 --> 52:18.218
This is like a paradise.

52:18.301 --> 52:20.804
You know we haven't had breakfast yet.

52:22.973 --> 52:23.890
[Max] Delicious.

52:24.182 --> 52:26.393
Oh, look. I got it.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.729
What? Oh, Irish soda bread.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.481
Irish soda bread. That's-- Yeah.

52:31.565 --> 52:33.024
Oh. Oh.

52:33.108 --> 52:35.068
-Okay.
-Very nice.

52:35.152 --> 52:36.403
[Phil] Oh, now she's excited.

52:37.112 --> 52:39.322
You know what it needs?
A little more butter!

52:39.406 --> 52:41.825
[Helen laughs]

52:43.535 --> 52:45.954
Ha, ha! Richard!

52:46.037 --> 52:49.124
-[Richard laughs]
-[Helen laughs]

52:49.207 --> 52:52.210
You also went to the pig farm there,
where the pigs are.

52:52.335 --> 52:53.670
You feed-- To feed the pigs.

52:53.753 --> 52:54.754
That's right.

52:56.464 --> 53:00.302
We went through that already. Yes.

53:00.385 --> 53:02.554
-When was that?
-A few minutes ago.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.307
Maybe it's not the ladies at bridge.

53:05.390 --> 53:06.850
[Helen laughs]

53:06.933 --> 53:09.728
-So, we'll talk to you when you get home.
-Yes.

53:09.811 --> 53:12.063
Enjoy the rest of your stay there.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.023
Thank you.

53:13.106 --> 53:15.692
-Can't have it any better, really.
-I think you're right.

53:15.775 --> 53:18.111
-Would you like to be in his place?
-No!

53:18.195 --> 53:21.448
[Phil laughs]

53:21.531 --> 53:25.368
-I enjoy it here with you.
-Maybe you couldn't have it any better.

53:25.827 --> 53:27.329
Right.

53:27.787 --> 53:28.830
You think of that?

53:31.249 --> 53:33.418
[Phil laughs]

53:35.378 --> 53:38.673
Thank you for the good ending. Goodbye!

53:39.758 --> 53:40.759
Stay well.

53:40.842 --> 53:41.968
[Phil] You, too!

53:43.094 --> 53:45.305
[chuckles]

53:45.388 --> 53:47.599
"Maybe you couldn't have it any better."

53:53.230 --> 53:54.231
That's all you want.

53:57.192 --> 53:59.694
[Phil] It seems hard not to feel good
when you're in Ireland.

54:02.489 --> 54:05.742
I've loved the food here
and the spectacular scenery,

54:06.785 --> 54:09.746
but to me the best part of travelling
are the people you meet

54:09.829 --> 54:11.039
and the friends you make.

54:12.916 --> 54:14.668
Would you like a pudding?

54:16.795 --> 54:20.840
And sometimes you find people
whose attitude about life is so wonderful

54:21.383 --> 54:23.051
even if it seems crazy,

54:23.969 --> 54:25.679
you'd be crazy to forget about it.

54:27.806 --> 54:30.225
And sometimes you can't forget about it.

55:14.894 --> 55:16.938
[cheering]

55:17.022 --> 55:18.106
[Phil] Whoo!

55:20.066 --> 55:22.402
[Phil screams]

55:24.195 --> 55:29.409
[Phil] You don't travel, "Oh, I hope
I come back changed," right?

55:30.535 --> 55:33.830
But all I'm asking is
that you keep an open mind.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.209
-I got you.
-There we go. Yes. [laughs]

55:42.630 --> 55:43.798
[chuckles]

55:43.882 --> 55:45.592
-I'm just like them.
-You all right?

55:46.343 --> 55:47.761
-Clearly you did it.
-Great.

55:48.303 --> 55:50.055
I can be buried in Ireland now?

55:51.306 --> 55:53.266
No, I mean now. [chuckles]
