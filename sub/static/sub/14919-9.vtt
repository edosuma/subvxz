WEBVTT

00:01.408 --> 00:03.943
Okay, forever tabs, take one.

00:05.134 --> 00:07.167
"Are you tired of feeling old?

00:07.242 --> 00:09.943
"Do you miss waking
up with vim and vigor?

00:10.026 --> 00:12.642
"Seniors, the first step
to a healthy tomorrow

00:12.643 --> 00:17.163
"is to get a good range of vitamins
and nutrients in your diet?

00:17.299 --> 00:20.914
Forever tabs can help
you do just that."

00:20.958 --> 00:23.933
Forever tabs? Frank, good God.
Are you serious?

00:23.934 --> 00:26.436
Well, who doesn't want a
little more vim and vigor?

00:26.437 --> 00:27.682
Just pick it up
from the end, Nora.

00:27.683 --> 00:29.589
Yes, Frank, from the end.

00:30.898 --> 00:34.355
"Forever tabs can
help you do just that.

00:34.426 --> 00:36.625
I use them." No, I don't use them.

00:36.626 --> 00:39.020
All you have to do is take one pill,
and you're legally clear.

00:39.023 --> 00:40.859
"Them" is plural, Frank.

00:41.806 --> 00:43.468
Then take two. I take four.

00:43.469 --> 00:45.926
But look, if you want me to
do the spot, I'll do the spot.

00:45.927 --> 00:47.705
They asked for her on this one.

00:47.706 --> 00:49.911
Why is that? Am I more
senior than he is?

00:50.081 --> 00:51.312
Hardly.

00:52.338 --> 00:55.768
Let's... do the, uh,
hotel spot, Nora.

00:56.679 --> 00:58.279
They're offering
rooms for half price.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.723
I'll get you some more water

00:59.724 --> 01:01.366
and give you a second
to look it over.

01:01.367 --> 01:02.651
All right.

01:02.652 --> 01:05.625
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

01:07.437 --> 01:09.435
Oh, good God and heaven.

01:09.436 --> 01:10.258
What?

01:10.259 --> 01:12.902
Frank, I can't say this.
Nora, Nora, Nora, what is it?

01:12.903 --> 01:15.200
Oh, God. This is so cheesy.

01:15.201 --> 01:17.065
I'm embarrassed to
even read it to you.

01:17.066 --> 01:18.415
It can't be that bad.

01:18.416 --> 01:20.209
"The Hotel Velone...

01:21.093 --> 01:24.309
We make the beds,
you make the magic."

01:24.310 --> 01:25.582
Ooh, that's... that's
pretty catchy, actually.

01:25.583 --> 01:27.119
Oh, yeah, there's more. Yeah?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.598
"Turndown service

01:28.599 --> 01:32.685
comes with a boat of strawberries
in every room." Strawberries.

01:32.734 --> 01:34.136
What the hell would
you do with that?

01:34.137 --> 01:35.042
Oh, they're high in
vitamin C... Karl.

01:35.084 --> 01:38.603
What? There are windows on
all four sides of this room.

01:38.636 --> 01:41.252
So? We're adults.

01:41.253 --> 01:42.534
Your daughter owns the station.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.381
I mean, how much trouble
can we get in to? Hmm?

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.529 --> 01:58.648
* So I'll sleep all day *.

01:58.649 --> 02:01.050
One skinny vanilla late with whip.

02:01.988 --> 02:04.404
Oh. Well, thank you.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.641
Is it your birthday or something?

02:06.642 --> 02:08.013
No. Why?

02:08.014 --> 02:09.880
Uh, well, you know, you've been
coming in the last few days.

02:09.881 --> 02:12.040
Every morning, you order
a skinny vanilla latte,

02:12.041 --> 02:14.885
and then today out
of nowhere... whip.

02:14.886 --> 02:18.164
So, uh, I thought it might
be a special occasion.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.608
No. I just thought
that I would, you know,

02:20.609 --> 02:22.529
try something new.

02:28.036 --> 02:28.577
"The presidency:

02:28.644 --> 02:32.003
A deconstruction of
American politics."

02:32.004 --> 02:34.139
Wow. That sounds political. It is.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.391
I'm... I'm teaching a seminar.

02:36.392 --> 02:38.559
Hmm. Uh, I'm more
into fiction myself.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.162
You know, I guess I'd rather read

02:39.163 --> 02:40.780
something interesting than true.

02:41.564 --> 02:44.060
Ah. Really? Well, uh...

02:44.688 --> 02:47.297
Why do you think
they can't be both?

02:49.261 --> 02:50.970
Did you know that president Taft

02:50.971 --> 02:53.468
got stuck in a white
house bathtub,

02:53.635 --> 02:56.453
and they had to pry him
out with a big board?

02:57.460 --> 02:58.276
That's all you got?

02:58.277 --> 03:00.435
Warren harding had sex
in a white house closet,

03:00.436 --> 03:01.703
died of ptomaine poisoning,

03:01.704 --> 03:04.841
and rumor had it that
his wife murdered him.

03:05.871 --> 03:07.359
Not bad. Not bad.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.799
So, um, if you had to choose

03:09.800 --> 03:12.264
of all our presidents,

03:12.629 --> 03:14.180
which one would you
have slept with?

03:17.858 --> 03:20.381
Well... you can decide later.

03:22.194 --> 03:23.191
Lincoln.

03:23.393 --> 03:24.496
Really?

03:25.144 --> 03:26.680
Lincoln? Wow. Interesting.

03:27.877 --> 03:29.717
They named a bedroom after him.

03:32.298 --> 03:33.931
Oh, sorry.

03:33.932 --> 03:36.188
I'm Seth, by the way.

03:36.931 --> 03:37.924
Kitty.

03:39.747 --> 03:40.324
Hi, Kevin.

03:40.325 --> 03:42.416
When you were trying to adopt,
how much weight did you gain?

03:42.417 --> 03:44.627
Please tell me you're
not emotionally eating.

03:44.628 --> 03:46.728
Well, that depends if you think
a cannoli, two bear claws,

03:46.729 --> 03:48.609
and a lindzer torte
constitutes breakfast.

03:48.610 --> 03:49.741
You guys are shoe-ins.

03:49.742 --> 03:51.548
The social worker is
going to love you.

03:51.549 --> 03:52.748
Well, what if she hates us?

03:52.749 --> 03:54.245
One bad impression
is all it takes.

03:54.246 --> 03:55.240
Everything has to be perfect.

03:55.241 --> 03:58.032
You and Scotty are a
foster adoption dream team.

03:58.033 --> 04:00.936
I'm a nervous guy,
okay? Okay, for a child...

04:00.937 --> 04:02.467
What if there's a flood?
Oh, my God.

04:02.468 --> 04:05.115
This barista is
totally hitting on me.

04:05.116 --> 04:07.471
Kit, I'm in the middle of a crisis here.
Oh, no, you're not,

04:07.472 --> 04:09.592
and besides, this is gonna
take your mind off of it.

04:09.593 --> 04:10.797
Oh, okay. What does he look like?

04:10.798 --> 04:13.202
He's very cute in a
genius bar kind of way.

04:13.203 --> 04:16.195
Oh, a brownie.
Hallelujah. Oh, my God.

04:17.428 --> 04:18.495
Oh, my God.

04:18.497 --> 04:20.577
He wrote his number
on my coffee cup.

04:20.620 --> 04:21.676
What do I do?

04:24.041 --> 04:25.093
That's Sarah. I gotta go.

04:25.094 --> 04:27.065
Bye. Wait, Kevin? Kevin?

04:27.624 --> 04:29.083
Hi, queen of all media.

04:29.292 --> 04:33.107
I just saw mom making out
with our on-air psychiatrist

04:33.108 --> 04:34.612
in the studio.

04:34.677 --> 04:37.495
You gonna fire her? No,
I wouldn't have just cause.

04:37.496 --> 04:38.587
But it would be fun.

04:38.588 --> 04:40.730
I can't believe you
work with mom. I don't.

04:40.731 --> 04:43.908
She's an employee of one radio
station of five that I own.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.903
She's a very small
ant in my kingdom.

04:47.101 --> 04:48.503
Now why did you call earlier?

04:48.504 --> 04:50.055
I wanted to know good
preschools in L.A...

04:50.056 --> 04:51.144
Just in case the social worker

04:51.145 --> 04:53.936
asks what we're thinking
in terms of education.

04:53.937 --> 04:57.328
You know, there is such a thing
as being overly prepared.

04:57.652 --> 04:59.236
Now listen, I'm trying
to get outta here.

04:59.811 --> 05:01.084
Luc's off to China tomorrow,

05:01.085 --> 05:02.821
so if you don't have
anything else... Oh,

05:02.857 --> 05:04.419
right. So what are the
plans for tonight?

05:04.420 --> 05:07.028
I'm gonna surprise Luc
with something special.

05:07.298 --> 05:08.537
Like what? Well, if I tell you,

05:08.538 --> 05:10.329
it won't be a surprise
for very long, will it?

05:10.901 --> 05:12.420
I think this brownie
was a little much.

05:12.421 --> 05:13.653
I better go. The what?

05:13.743 --> 05:16.879
What? What? Oh, nothing.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.001
Sarah, honey, I-I hope
you're not upset about the...

05:21.020 --> 05:24.413
Mom, you can kiss anyone
you want at work, okay?

05:24.417 --> 05:27.423
I never let it stop me.
No, me neither.

05:27.444 --> 05:30.316
Oh, for God sake, Sarah.
Would you please warn me

05:30.317 --> 05:31.609
when there are other
people in the room?

05:31.610 --> 05:32.575
Don't worry, mom. I have to go.

05:32.576 --> 05:34.600
Say good-bye to Luc for me,
Sarah. Okay, bye.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.984
Good luck today, honey. Oh. Bye.

05:39.117 --> 05:42.108
Sarah, why won't you let me
have everyone over tonight

05:42.109 --> 05:43.632
so we can celebrate Luc?

05:43.633 --> 05:45.656
I mean, he's painting
a mural in Shanghai.

05:45.657 --> 05:48.520
Thanks, mom, but no.
Tonight is strictly Luc and me.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.685
Anyway, won't you be busy?

05:52.971 --> 05:54.042
What do you mean by that?

05:54.252 --> 05:56.333
Okay. If you don't want
to talk about Karl...

05:59.608 --> 06:00.504
Sarah...

06:01.332 --> 06:02.852
I like him so much.

06:03.509 --> 06:04.820
I like him so much.

06:04.821 --> 06:07.051
I-I-I j... I swear, I'm, like,

06:07.052 --> 06:09.716
completely and utterly
falling head over heels.

06:09.717 --> 06:10.535
In love?

06:10.536 --> 06:13.067
No. Down the stairs.
What do you think?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.841
Mom, that's fantastic.

06:14.842 --> 06:19.740
We've been to dinners
and lunches and movies.

06:19.741 --> 06:21.431
Anything else? No.

06:21.432 --> 06:22.397
Oh.

06:22.398 --> 06:25.541
But that's not so
important right now.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.259
No, no. That's not important.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.485
That's why you were
making out in the studio.

06:30.836 --> 06:33.135
W-well, of... of
course it's important.

06:33.136 --> 06:36.593
But look, I've been through
some things over the past years,

06:36.594 --> 06:38.483
and I-I don't mind taking it slow.

06:38.484 --> 06:40.591
There's nothing wrong with slow.
Nothing wrong with slow.

06:40.592 --> 06:42.806
Slow is good. Slow is good.

06:44.294 --> 06:45.592
Can we enjoy this?

06:45.593 --> 06:48.263
Foster adoption is
supposed to be joyful.

06:48.264 --> 06:49.726
It's about starting a family.

06:49.727 --> 06:51.839
Okay, but we have to
control the variables.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.379
You know, strangers come into
this restaurant every day.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.605
Kevin, they're customers.
All right.

06:56.606 --> 06:58.064
But is that a safe
environment for a child?

06:58.065 --> 06:58.967
I mean, what if there's a flood?

06:58.968 --> 07:00.383
We're getting a visit
from the social worker,

07:00.384 --> 07:02.531
not the FBI. Oh, we need
to get fingerprinted, too.

07:02.532 --> 07:05.108
Don't worry. The FBI is coming.
Scotty, have you seen my bag?

07:05.402 --> 07:07.148
Uh, no. Kevin? No.

07:07.149 --> 07:09.289
It was a little brown bag
with a brownie in it. Oh.

07:09.319 --> 07:10.825
Oh, yeah. I ate it.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.695
What? I saw it. I was hungry.

07:13.696 --> 07:15.738
It all happened so
fast after that.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.239
I'll buy you a new one.
You can't, actually.

07:18.240 --> 07:21.105
Uh, my prescription's up.
That was the last of my stash.

07:21.848 --> 07:22.792
Thanks a lot.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.667
Prescription for what?

07:26.419 --> 07:28.450
Medical marijuana.
It's for his back.

07:30.204 --> 07:33.261
* Why can't you just
believe in me? *.

07:35.641 --> 07:37.705
Look up.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.248
Uh, hey.

07:41.249 --> 07:42.991
Uh, what's, uh,
what's... what's up?

07:42.992 --> 07:44.729
Well, I just wanted to make sure

07:44.730 --> 07:46.409
that you gave me the right number.

07:50.364 --> 07:51.341
Mm.

07:51.499 --> 07:52.211
Oh.

07:52.212 --> 07:53.135
You're so hot.

07:53.136 --> 07:55.136
I know. I know.

07:55.563 --> 07:56.490
How old are you?

07:56.491 --> 07:59.149
27. Oh, my God. You're 27.

07:59.476 --> 08:02.485
Do you hit on a lot
of older women?

08:02.900 --> 08:05.115
No, and you're not old.

08:05.116 --> 08:06.460
Mm.

08:07.352 --> 08:09.527
Oh, my God. You're sweet.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.045
Okay.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.177
What?

08:14.212 --> 08:15.349
That was fun.

08:17.628 --> 08:19.404
Look, uh, call me sometime.

08:19.768 --> 08:20.664
Hmm.

08:49.768 --> 08:51.020
I knew you would call back.

08:51.021 --> 08:52.990
You slept with a 20 year old?

08:52.991 --> 08:55.664
27, and no I didn't sleep with him.
We just made out.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.348
Then why did you type
that you hooked up?

08:57.349 --> 08:58.943
Hooking up can mean anything

08:58.944 --> 09:01.292
from making out to casual sex.

09:01.293 --> 09:03.223
Yeah, well, next time,
could you be more specific?

09:03.224 --> 09:04.572
Because I am a very busy woman.

09:04.573 --> 09:06.587
Okay. He's a barista
in a coffee shop.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.088
Oh. Of course he is.
What's his name...

09:09.089 --> 09:11.270
Taylor, Tyler... hmm.

09:11.271 --> 09:14.056
Scooter? Actually,
I don't even remember.

09:14.516 --> 09:15.543
Who are you right now?

09:15.544 --> 09:17.876
I don't know. I guess I'm lucky.

09:18.277 --> 09:20.132
I guess I'm fabulous.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.588
Where did you make out?

09:22.589 --> 09:24.539
On top of the coffee beans.

09:24.692 --> 09:27.205
Oh, my God. And I
thought I was risque.

09:27.206 --> 09:29.091
I know. Can you even believe it?

09:29.092 --> 09:30.796
I mean, I am so proud of myself.

09:30.797 --> 09:34.763
I am usually so decorous and
appropriate and... and...

09:34.764 --> 09:36.255
I don't know. I don't know...

09:36.256 --> 09:39.040
Excuse me, but the maitre d' at
the restaurant gave me this key.

09:39.881 --> 09:40.719
Just...

09:40.720 --> 09:41.496
Kitty, I gotta go.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.876
I'm in a very important meeting.
You are such a liar,

09:43.877 --> 09:45.548
Sarah. I know that Luc
is there with you.

09:45.549 --> 09:46.557
Good-bye.

09:47.648 --> 09:49.256
"Meet me for lunch
at hotel Velone"?

09:49.257 --> 09:52.459
Wouldn't you prefer room service?
How's the menu?

09:52.460 --> 09:55.612
It is... extensive.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.952
Hello. I'm Sarah.

09:59.526 --> 10:02.950
I am your hostess for today...

10:03.831 --> 10:05.176
This evening...

10:06.700 --> 10:07.981
And tomorrow morning.

10:08.599 --> 10:09.417
Hello.

10:11.672 --> 10:14.072
Would you like to start
with an appetizer?

10:14.156 --> 10:15.213
Oh, yeah.

10:15.717 --> 10:18.517
Anything blow the waist
is considered a tip.

10:18.864 --> 10:20.016
Okay.

10:21.572 --> 10:23.669
Excuse me, Ms. McCallister?

10:24.160 --> 10:26.200
Oh, dean Whitley, hi. Hello.

10:26.201 --> 10:27.423
Oh, please do not stand.

10:27.424 --> 10:29.484
Oh, no, please.
You have come all the way down

10:29.485 --> 10:31.059
to the political
science department.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.735
The least I can do is give
you a proper greeting.

10:33.736 --> 10:34.708
And I think it's you

10:34.709 --> 10:37.705
who came all the way down
to Wexley university. Oh.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.880
When I heard that you agreed
to offer this seminar,

10:39.881 --> 10:42.732
I ran out on my balcony
to watch the liberal bias

10:42.733 --> 10:46.139
of higher education shift
slightly back to center.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.257
Well, I'm very happy that I
can provide some balance.

10:49.258 --> 10:51.458
And perhaps when some of
these eager young minds

10:51.481 --> 10:54.263
meet a brilliant
republican role model

10:54.264 --> 10:55.591
and listen to her lectures

10:55.592 --> 10:59.684
and talk to her at the coffee shop...
Oh... yes, yes.

10:59.689 --> 11:00.625
Well, I just want you to know

11:00.626 --> 11:04.324
that I-I am so looking
forward to this opportunity.

11:04.325 --> 11:07.093
Good. Now if you
ever need anything,

11:07.124 --> 11:09.111
please remember to call me.

11:09.112 --> 11:11.271
And, um, oh, oh,
I forgot to tell you.

11:11.272 --> 11:14.525
The alumni association's having
a fund-raiser next month,

11:14.526 --> 11:16.112
and they're hoping you will agree

11:16.113 --> 11:17.700
to be on the host committee.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.059
Whatever I can do to help.

11:21.060 --> 11:22.404
Good. I will tell
them to call you.

11:22.405 --> 11:25.968
And it was just lovely
seeing you again.

11:25.969 --> 11:26.988
Thank you. Thank you.

11:26.989 --> 11:29.472
I am going to walk you out,

11:29.473 --> 11:32.804
because I have a
very sudden desire

11:32.805 --> 11:34.357
for a cup of coffee.

11:35.973 --> 11:37.108
Hmm.

11:42.656 --> 11:44.193
How are you feeling?

11:46.425 --> 11:48.488
I am so stoned right now.
You have to help me.

11:48.489 --> 11:49.840
Okay, Kevin,
why don't you go lie down

11:49.841 --> 11:50.651
in the bedroom or something?

11:50.652 --> 11:52.756
'Cause the social worker's
gonna be here any minute.

11:52.757 --> 11:54.838
No, I told you. She's not
coming until tomorrow.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.219
People like me do not
deserve children.

11:57.220 --> 11:58.791
I should be behind bars, Scotty.

11:58.792 --> 12:01.576
I'm gonna turn myself in.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:01.577 --> 12:03.831
I've only been stoned ever
once before in my life.

12:03.879 --> 12:05.510
I thought I should try pot
before I went to college,

12:05.511 --> 12:07.022
so I bought a joint
from Ozzie Archibald.

12:07.023 --> 12:09.304
It was as big as a cigar.
Okay, that's called a blunt.

12:09.305 --> 12:11.417
I-I made sure no one was home,
and then I went out to the yard

12:11.418 --> 12:13.156
and I smoked it.
You smoked the whole thing?

12:13.157 --> 12:15.275
Half. I don't know.
I buried the rest

12:15.276 --> 12:17.467
in Justin's old sandbox,
just in case the police found it.

12:17.468 --> 12:20.260
Then I locked myself in my room,
read an old Spanish textbook,

12:20.261 --> 12:22.917
'cause I thought if I could just
focus on something, anything...

12:23.136 --> 12:25.868
Then mom came home...
I'm starting to freak out again.

12:25.869 --> 12:28.132
Okay, Kevin, breathe.
Come sit down.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.136
She needed help
with the groceries,

12:29.137 --> 12:30.884
so I had to go back
into the kitchen,

12:30.885 --> 12:32.168
and she just looked like

12:32.169 --> 12:34.863
a giant piñata floating
above me... really?

12:34.864 --> 12:37.503
And then she started
speaking in Spanish. Really?

12:37.504 --> 12:39.096
Yeah. There must have been
something else in that joint.

12:39.097 --> 12:41.368
Well, I don't know.
I don't do drugs.

12:42.556 --> 12:44.403
I have to find Sarah. Sarah?

12:44.404 --> 12:47.403
Yeah. Sarah. Wh... Sarah?

12:47.404 --> 12:49.567
When Sarah came back, she
immediately saw how baked I was,

12:49.568 --> 12:51.390
and she managed to get me
from paranoid schizophrenic

12:51.391 --> 12:54.947
into groggy, stupid, and hungry.
Okay, well, wh-what did she do?

12:54.948 --> 12:57.092
I don't know. I have to call her.
You can't call Sarah.

12:57.093 --> 12:58.676
She's got some big
extravaganza with Luc tonight.

12:58.677 --> 12:59.982
Well, you're starting
to speak in Spanish,

12:59.983 --> 13:01.075
so I don't have a choice.

13:01.861 --> 13:03.624
I can't believe I
forgot my glasses.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.952
This is painful.

13:05.228 --> 13:07.636
Like trying to read the
nutritional information

13:07.637 --> 13:10.117
on the back of a cereal box.
Here. Try mine.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.247
Oh, thank you. What a gentleman.

13:14.144 --> 13:16.688
Always happy to help
a damsel in distress.

13:18.841 --> 13:19.754
Karl.

13:23.188 --> 13:24.549
I've been thinking...

13:25.184 --> 13:26.105
About us.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.635
Really? Me, too.

13:29.773 --> 13:30.781
Really?

13:31.913 --> 13:32.728
Mm-hmm.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.401
What if we don't order anything?

13:36.179 --> 13:38.313
I mean, what if we do
something totally insane?

13:39.093 --> 13:42.246
Let's... check in to hotel Velone.

13:42.247 --> 13:43.586
I mean, they're
having this promotion,

13:43.587 --> 13:46.736
rooms are half off.
Are you serious?

13:46.737 --> 13:48.512
Oh, for heaven sake, Nora.

13:49.256 --> 13:50.507
I mean, it's obviously
been a while

13:50.508 --> 13:53.096
since I asked a woman to,
you know,

13:53.097 --> 13:55.131
anything like this, so...

13:55.236 --> 13:56.464
Well, I'm glad you did.

13:56.465 --> 14:00.328
I'm... I'm... I'm really
very glad you did.

14:00.329 --> 14:02.979
It's just that,
if we're gonna do this...

14:02.980 --> 14:06.335
Yes? Spend the night together...

14:06.336 --> 14:10.398
Ah, yes. My apartment
is boring and...

14:10.399 --> 14:11.776
Well, why don't we go to my place?

14:11.777 --> 14:13.251
I've been there before. Remember?

14:13.252 --> 14:14.132
Oh.

14:14.161 --> 14:18.523
As were most of your children,
various family members.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.272
Yes, well... yeah.

14:19.273 --> 14:22.537
They do have a tendency to show
up every now and then. Mm-hmm.

14:23.064 --> 14:24.041
Yeah.

14:24.813 --> 14:27.419
I'd have to...
I have to go home first.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.041
Me, too.

14:30.145 --> 14:31.393
So what do you think?

14:32.657 --> 14:34.355
They make the beds...

14:35.337 --> 14:36.697
We make the magic.

14:38.025 --> 14:40.857
I wasn't expecting a honeymoon
until after we were married.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.920
Call it a sneak preview.

14:45.876 --> 14:47.155
Oh! Oh, God. I'm so...

14:47.156 --> 14:48.607
Oh... gosh. Oh!

14:48.608 --> 14:50.618
Luc, I'm so sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.

14:50.619 --> 14:52.114
Let me get some ice. Yeah. Oh.

14:52.115 --> 14:55.600
I'll get you a towel.
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

14:57.039 --> 14:57.983
Oh.

15:00.616 --> 15:02.701
Hello. Hey, Kev.

15:02.896 --> 15:03.857
Ow.

15:04.584 --> 15:06.634
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was a surprise.

15:07.125 --> 15:08.181
No, we're fine.

15:08.693 --> 15:09.876
Yeah, at hotel Velone.

15:10.301 --> 15:11.852
Kevin? Hello?

15:12.908 --> 15:15.296
Weird. Uh,
Kevin just hung up on me.

15:15.297 --> 15:16.264
Please tell me that you didn't

15:16.265 --> 15:18.984
tell him where we were.
Uh, so what if I did?

15:20.445 --> 15:21.951
Well, then it would
only be a matter of time

15:21.952 --> 15:22.903
before they come over.

15:22.904 --> 15:24.074
They'll want to see the room.

15:25.211 --> 15:26.935
Gay people love this hotel.

15:27.036 --> 15:28.270
All right. I'm sorry, babe.

15:28.271 --> 15:29.202
Ouch.

15:29.203 --> 15:30.563
I know you want
tonight to be perfect,

15:30.564 --> 15:33.144
but no one is coming over here,
not even your brother.

15:33.145 --> 15:36.469
Yes, well, even so, I think we
should have all cell phones off.

15:36.699 --> 15:39.463
Complete radio silence.

15:40.459 --> 15:41.032
Oh!

15:41.033 --> 15:42.857
Oh! Honey, I am so sorry.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.016
Oh. Oh!

15:46.301 --> 15:47.319
Oh! Ay! Ay-yi-yi!

15:47.320 --> 15:49.642
Oh, God. Oh, no. Ay!

15:49.643 --> 15:51.819
Ah. Oh, ow. Let me see.
It's bleeding.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.110
Ah. Gosh.

15:55.841 --> 15:57.995
If this is a sneak preview,
I can only imagine

15:57.996 --> 15:59.804
what a real honeymoon
is gonna be like.

16:08.361 --> 16:11.865
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, yeah.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.679
That's really... yeah.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.327
Yeah, no, don't... don't stop. Mm.

16:16.328 --> 16:17.448
That...

16:18.576 --> 16:20.775
You know, I used to love
watching that show that you did,

16:20.776 --> 16:22.904
the, uh, "red, white, and blue."

16:23.169 --> 16:24.272
Are you serious?

16:24.273 --> 16:26.849
You have known who I
am this entire time?

16:26.850 --> 16:28.146
Was I not supposed to?

16:30.868 --> 16:32.523
Fine. Fine. I don't care. Well...

16:32.524 --> 16:34.370
Just keep massaging my hand.
That's what I thought.

16:34.371 --> 16:36.320
Mm. So...

16:36.940 --> 16:39.896
Ah. Do you, uh... ooh.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.101
Do you remember my name?

16:43.188 --> 16:45.027
Well... hmm?

16:45.028 --> 16:46.962
You know, I-I-I don't

16:46.963 --> 16:48.701
think you ever told me your name.
Yes, I did.

16:48.702 --> 16:50.399
No, you didn't. Yes, I did.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.708
Okay, what is it? It's Seth.

16:51.709 --> 16:53.276
Seth. Mm-hmm.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.236
Seth. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:57.237 --> 16:59.133
Wait a minute. Stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

16:59.134 --> 17:01.189
I don't... I don't... My God,
what am I doing here?

17:01.190 --> 17:03.636
You're having fun.
You're having fun.

17:03.637 --> 17:06.182
Just relax. Just relax. Oh.

17:06.396 --> 17:07.359
There you go.

17:09.256 --> 17:11.171
Okay. Well,
if you keep doing that,

17:11.172 --> 17:13.099
I actually might fall asleep.

17:13.101 --> 17:13.538
Mm.

17:13.539 --> 17:16.675
That's... that's not
what I had in mind.

17:16.992 --> 17:17.723
Okay, you know what?

17:17.723 --> 17:19.765
You're, like,
out of a porno movie.

17:19.766 --> 17:22.145
I mean, I'm surprised you didn't
show up here with a pizza.

17:22.146 --> 17:23.742
You know what? Now you're
talking. I'm starving.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.057
I can get a pizza.
You know, I have to go out anyway

17:26.385 --> 17:28.048
if, uh... Why do you
have to go out anyway?

17:28.477 --> 17:29.483
Uh...

17:29.931 --> 17:32.499
Uh... it's kind of embarrassing,

17:32.500 --> 17:34.587
but I only brought two condoms.
Oh, well, hurry up.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.044
All right. Just hurry up.

17:39.149 --> 17:41.981
Hello. Luc. Hi, um, it's Scotty.

17:42.049 --> 17:43.604
We're kind of
downstairs in the lobby.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.810
They make me feel better.
I want to hold one.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.992
He really needs to see Sarah.

17:48.594 --> 17:49.976
Yes. Thank you.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.993
Okay. We'll be up
in two minutes. Bye.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.156
Okay, let's go.

18:05.336 --> 18:08.578
Got your first aid kit.
Thank you so much.

18:08.579 --> 18:10.204
Housekeeping should
be done cleaning soon.

18:10.205 --> 18:12.811
I'm sorry about the mess... My name's,
uh, West. Dr. West.

18:12.812 --> 18:13.837
Karl.

18:17.308 --> 18:18.235
Sarah.

18:18.374 --> 18:19.805
Hi. Oh, what a surprise.

18:19.806 --> 18:22.455
Yeah. Are you staying here,
too? Nope. Unh-unh.

18:22.456 --> 18:25.000
Just sign here, sir.
You'll be in room 714.

18:26.863 --> 18:28.864
Wait. Ar-are you
here with my mother?

18:29.481 --> 18:30.345
No.

18:31.445 --> 18:32.389
Oh.

18:32.913 --> 18:35.422
No, I... no,
I... I'm working on a book.

18:35.423 --> 18:37.484
I sometimes...
I check in to a hotel...

18:37.485 --> 18:38.570
Oh. So I can focus better.

18:38.571 --> 18:40.875
I work best alone.
Oh, you don't live alone?

18:40.876 --> 18:41.740
Yeah.

18:42.511 --> 18:44.715
But, um, my... my
neighbors are... are doing

18:44.716 --> 18:46.821
this massive kitchen remodel,
and the noise...

18:46.822 --> 18:49.481
So I decided to splurge on
a little peace and quiet.

18:49.482 --> 18:51.396
It's half off. Yeah.
Yeah, half off.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.519
So, um... what brings you here?

18:53.520 --> 18:55.827
Oh, my fiancée is going
on a long business trip,

18:55.828 --> 18:58.209
so, you know, we wanted
to have a romantic night,

18:58.210 --> 18:59.588
just the two of us.

18:59.973 --> 19:03.157
Um, look, I won't keep you.
Nice to see you, Karl. Yeah.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.103
Oh, Dr. west, would you like

19:06.104 --> 19:08.040
the complimentary
strawberries and cream?

19:08.088 --> 19:09.929
Yeah, I-I think she'd like that.

19:12.136 --> 19:13.920
Good luck with your book.

19:19.541 --> 19:21.140
Oh, my God. I gotta call mom.

19:21.229 --> 19:23.875
I just ran into Karl west
downstairs checking in,

19:23.876 --> 19:25.892
ordering strawberries.

19:26.940 --> 19:27.737
Sarah.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.969
Scotty. What the hell
are you doing here?

19:29.970 --> 19:31.380
I'm so sorry.
I know we're intruding.

19:31.381 --> 19:34.683
But I didn't know where
else we could go. "We"?

19:34.684 --> 19:36.052
Yeah. Kevin is in the bathroom.

19:36.053 --> 19:38.091
Oh, no. He ate a pot brownie.

19:38.092 --> 19:40.079
Oh, God. It was an accident.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.744
All right, Kevin. Come out here.

19:42.996 --> 19:44.850
I'm so sorry. It's just,
last time this happened,

19:44.851 --> 19:46.696
you somehow helped
me get through it.

19:46.697 --> 19:47.782
Are people speaking Spanish?

19:47.783 --> 19:49.375
Si, un poquito. Oh, God.

19:49.376 --> 19:51.408
I thought we should help.
I'm so pathetic. I'm so sorry.

19:51.409 --> 19:52.712
Look, I know you can't help me.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.423
I have to find my own way home.
No, Kevin. Lie down.

19:54.424 --> 19:56.315
Okay. We'll get you some
coffee or something, okay?

19:56.316 --> 19:58.055
Yeah. Oh, coffee.
Is that what you did last time?

19:58.056 --> 20:01.003
I don't remember, but his
problems are way more serious

20:01.004 --> 20:03.463
than that right now. The police
are outside. No, they're not.

20:03.464 --> 20:04.930
Yes, they are.
I passed them on the way up...

20:04.931 --> 20:07.675
A whole S.W.A.T. team headed this way.
That's ridiculous.

20:07.676 --> 20:10.205
Hotels have dogs to
catch people like you,

20:10.251 --> 20:11.405
Kevin. What am I supposed to do?!

20:11.406 --> 20:12.797
You gotta pull it together.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.143
What's your birthday? Uh,
April 18, 1971.

20:16.144 --> 20:17.284
Mother's maiden name? Holden.

20:17.285 --> 20:18.995
Last 4 of your social? 5-3-5-2.

20:18.996 --> 20:19.581
Is that right? I'm not sure.

20:19.582 --> 20:20.892
Kevin? Yeah, it's right.

20:20.893 --> 20:23.324
Yes? Good. You feel better now?

20:24.977 --> 20:27.632
Yeah. A-a little. Maybe. I guess.

20:27.633 --> 20:28.903
Good. That's what I did last time.

20:28.904 --> 20:30.059
I just scared the crap out of him.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.360
Something about the
adrenaline shot. Mm.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.021
I gotta call mom.
Hey, Sarah, don't get involved.

20:34.022 --> 20:35.012
What's going on with mom? Karl

20:35.013 --> 20:37.515
just checked in to the hotel
for an afternoon romp.

20:37.516 --> 20:39.480
Oh, with mom? Wait.
She's here? Oh, my God.

20:39.481 --> 20:42.544
I'm freaking out again. No, not with mom.
See? That's the point.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.912
What's the point? Dr. Karl...
That's who I should call.

20:44.913 --> 20:46.624
I should call Dr. Karl. Don't get

20:46.625 --> 20:48.416
involved with your mother's
romantic relationship.

20:48.417 --> 20:50.235
I'm not gonna let this
guy break her heart.

20:50.236 --> 20:51.344
You don't even know
what's going on.

20:51.345 --> 20:54.160
You didn't see him. He was
like a deer in the headlights.

20:54.269 --> 20:55.260
Kevin doesn't even look as

20:55.261 --> 20:56.623
guilty as this guy.
Sarah, I'm warning you.

20:56.624 --> 21:00.239
Why don't you two take
Mr. Hemphead for a walk,

21:00.240 --> 21:02.846
sober him up? And what
about our romantic evening?

21:02.847 --> 21:05.027
It'll happen. Stop fighting.

21:05.028 --> 21:06.653
Okay, sweetheart.
Come on. Let's go.

21:06.654 --> 21:08.412
Let's get up.
I-I'll take care of them.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.462
Do what you need to do.

21:13.684 --> 21:15.252
Don't pet the dogs, Kevin.

21:19.365 --> 21:19.936
Hello.

21:19.937 --> 21:22.396
Kitty. Honey, I...
I'm sorry to bother you.

21:22.397 --> 21:25.073
I-I tried to call Sarah, but I
think she turned her phone off.

21:25.074 --> 21:27.575
Oh, hello, mom. How are you?

21:27.576 --> 21:30.733
Um... never mind, honey.
Never mind.

21:30.745 --> 21:32.864
I really shouldn't be
talking to you about this.

21:32.865 --> 21:35.095
Oh, okay. Well,
then I'll talk to you later.

21:35.096 --> 21:37.050
N-w-w-w-wait. Just because

21:37.051 --> 21:38.791
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this

21:38.792 --> 21:41.084
doesn't mean I'm not going
to talk to you about this.

21:41.085 --> 21:44.285
Okay. Well... what's wrong?

21:44.441 --> 21:45.547
It just...

21:45.760 --> 21:47.984
Karl and I figured it
was time for us to...

21:48.852 --> 21:51.653
Like you kids say, "hook up."

21:52.045 --> 21:54.504
You're right.
This is so not appropriate.

21:54.505 --> 21:55.688
Please listen.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.256
So... so we made a
date to do just that,

21:58.257 --> 22:00.666
and I... it just is
making me so nervous.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.380
We're making such a
big deal out of it.

22:02.381 --> 22:04.539
It's all so premeditated.
Oh, my God.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.564
Please tell me that you didn't
go to some hotel or something.

22:07.620 --> 22:09.733
No. No.

22:10.165 --> 22:12.564
No, we wouldn't do something
as stupid as that.

22:12.565 --> 22:15.891
I mean, why make a
nerve-racking situation worse?

22:15.892 --> 22:18.532
There is nothing for
you to be afraid of.

22:18.533 --> 22:22.196
Okay? People have been having
sex for thousands of years.

22:22.197 --> 22:22.913
I know.

22:22.914 --> 22:25.129
But the whole point is,
up until now,

22:25.175 --> 22:27.359
Karl and I have not
been one of 'em.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.675
Sweetie, I've got to go.

22:28.676 --> 22:31.083
Okay? Thanks...
thanks for talking to me.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.915
I'll... I'll talk
to you later. Bye.

22:32.916 --> 22:33.727
What floor?

22:33.728 --> 22:35.483
Uh, 7. Okay, sure.

22:35.484 --> 22:39.774
Aah! Aah! Aah! I'm so sorry.

22:50.385 --> 22:51.312
Oh.

22:51.553 --> 22:52.848
What happened to you?

22:54.697 --> 22:56.660
You would think a-a pizza boy

22:56.661 --> 22:58.250
would know how to carry his stuff

22:58.251 --> 23:00.161
without dumping it
all over people.

23:00.162 --> 23:01.324
You want me get to some club soda

23:01.325 --> 23:02.716
or something for you? No,
no, don't... don't bother.

23:02.717 --> 23:05.241
It's a... it's a lost cause.

23:05.768 --> 23:07.721
Poor kid. I felt sorry for him.

23:09.128 --> 23:10.780
I'm... I'm sorry I'm... I'm late.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.546
Everything always takes a
little longer than you think.

23:12.547 --> 23:14.739
I can... I can never
figure out these key cards.

23:14.740 --> 23:16.188
You know, they go in... right.

23:16.189 --> 23:17.213
Weird and...

23:17.317 --> 23:18.340
Out.

23:20.980 --> 23:22.243
What a nice room.

23:22.244 --> 23:23.040
Yep.

23:23.041 --> 23:25.896
There is the boat of
strawberries we were promised.

23:25.897 --> 23:28.340
Mm-hmm. And... and some mints...
That's nice.

23:28.341 --> 23:31.023
And, um, adjustable
lighting is... Mm.

23:31.024 --> 23:32.418
Is always a good thing.

23:33.698 --> 23:35.264
You're nervous. Aren't you?

23:35.716 --> 23:37.556
Yes, I am.

23:38.466 --> 23:39.323
Aren't you?

23:39.324 --> 23:41.885
Of course. Yes.

23:49.135 --> 23:50.019
Oh.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.301
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.189
I'm sorry.

23:52.190 --> 23:53.409
It's okay. Um...

23:53.410 --> 23:57.184
Yeah. You know, I'm... I'm soaking wet,
and I'm... and I'm sticky,

23:57.185 --> 24:00.208
so I'm just gonna, um,
I'm gonna just be right back,

24:00.209 --> 24:01.425
okay? Yep.

24:01.444 --> 24:03.508
Just be right back.

24:11.445 --> 24:13.653
Hello. Karl, it's Sarah.

24:14.871 --> 24:18.487
Yeah, yeah, yeah, s-Sarah.
Um, how can I help you?

24:18.488 --> 24:20.317
I'm not gonna pretend I
don't know what you're doing

24:20.318 --> 24:21.370
in this hotel.

24:21.371 --> 24:22.760
But you should know one thing.

24:22.789 --> 24:25.349
My mother has real
feelings for you.

24:26.338 --> 24:29.043
So if you lead her on, you won't
just have me to answer to.

24:29.044 --> 24:32.035
There are five of us, and we
look out for each other. Okay?

24:32.041 --> 24:33.722
I have to go. Good-bye.

24:34.465 --> 24:35.457
Grr.

24:35.472 --> 24:36.407
Wow. You wouldn't believe

24:36.408 --> 24:39.096
all the products in here.
Kevin would freak.

24:40.975 --> 24:42.563
I feel so bad about that woman.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.707
Hmm. Well, did you offer to
pay the dry cleaning bill?

24:46.708 --> 24:49.029
Yeah. You know, she refused
to take any money from me,

24:49.030 --> 24:52.419
and then I got so upset,
she somehow made me feel better.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.980
Oh, God. That sounds like
something my mother would do.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.636
Well, anyway, wine's better.

24:57.637 --> 25:00.164
Mm, yes, it is. Mm.

25:03.494 --> 25:05.661
So what are you gonna
be when you grow up?

25:06.463 --> 25:07.254
Well, I'm a writer.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.334
Oh. Or, you know, I'm...

25:08.335 --> 25:11.742
I'm trying to be. I haven't been,
uh, published or...

25:11.743 --> 25:13.438
Oh, well, please, that's okay.

25:13.439 --> 25:16.236
You know, Ulysses S.
Grant, he was a total loser.

25:16.237 --> 25:17.947
Complete failure most of his life.

25:17.948 --> 25:19.405
I've learned a lot
about presidents today.

25:19.406 --> 25:21.095
Well, you should take my class.

25:21.096 --> 25:24.388
You'd probably learn a lot more.
I could, you know?

25:24.920 --> 25:26.953
I am a grad student
in the lit department.

25:29.352 --> 25:30.159
You're kidding?

25:30.703 --> 25:31.789
No. You know,
it makes sense, right?

25:31.790 --> 25:34.003
Uh, coffee shop's two
blocks from campus.

25:34.004 --> 25:35.896
No. No.

25:36.147 --> 25:37.881
Oh, my God, no. No, no, no.

25:37.882 --> 25:39.973
This... this doesn't
make sense at... at all.

25:39.974 --> 25:43.118
This is... this is...
I-I-I teach there.

25:43.119 --> 25:45.351
Well, you said you
were a guest lecturer.

25:45.352 --> 25:46.149
Still.

25:47.298 --> 25:50.311
It... it... it... it's unethical.

25:50.312 --> 25:53.258
It... it is not unethical.

25:53.259 --> 25:56.473
W... well, okay,
then it's not the kind of example

25:56.474 --> 25:58.157
that I want to set, okay?

25:58.158 --> 26:00.376
Why didn't you tell me
this before? Well...

26:01.695 --> 26:04.710
You didn't ask, you know? And...
and I don't know.

26:04.711 --> 26:06.362
I didn't think it was
that big of a deal. I...

26:06.363 --> 26:07.828
That's actually
where you're wrong,

26:07.829 --> 26:08.993
because it's a very big deal.

26:08.994 --> 26:10.884
See, remember I told you
that I had to go see

26:10.885 --> 26:12.155
the young Wexley Republicans?

26:12.156 --> 26:13.892
Now how do you think they're
gonna feel when they find out

26:13.893 --> 26:16.690
that I've been hooking up
with a graduate student?

26:18.258 --> 26:22.192
I-I, you know, I-I ran for senate,

26:22.193 --> 26:24.489
so I have a certain reputation
that I have to live up to,

26:24.490 --> 26:29.582
and, um, I... you wanted to have
a little fun, and now it's over.

26:30.058 --> 26:30.971
I get it. I'm sorry.

26:30.972 --> 26:32.720
You know, you don't have to
make me feel bad. No, no.

26:32.721 --> 26:33.448
I feel bad. I... look, hey,

26:33.449 --> 26:35.828
don't, all right?
Don't feel bad, you know?

26:35.829 --> 26:38.368
I mean, look, contrary
to what you might think,

26:38.585 --> 26:39.327
we're both adults.

26:39.328 --> 26:40.781
I knew what I was getting into.

26:40.782 --> 26:41.670
I'm...

26:41.671 --> 26:44.517
I'll, uh... I'll go. I'll go.

26:44.518 --> 26:47.292
I'm... Oh, man. I'm sorry.
This is just...

26:48.713 --> 26:49.620
Oh.

26:51.199 --> 26:52.039
Oh.

26:55.770 --> 26:58.748
Well, maybe not the most
attractive thing on earth,

26:58.749 --> 27:00.546
but it's dry, and what the hell?

27:00.547 --> 27:03.756
You look beautiful.
Did I hear the phone ring?

27:03.757 --> 27:06.534
Who called? Yeah, yeah, it was, uh,
it was... it was housekeeping.

27:06.535 --> 27:07.229
Ah.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.221
Um...

27:11.406 --> 27:13.169
You know, there is, um...

27:13.746 --> 27:16.386
There is another robe
in there for you, too.

27:17.897 --> 27:19.450
And I'm feeling just
a little bit weird

27:19.451 --> 27:20.580
being the only person in the room

27:20.581 --> 27:22.179
not wearing any clothes, so...

27:23.544 --> 27:25.374
Why don't you take
your clothes off, too?

27:26.255 --> 27:28.444
Well, I-in a minute. In a minute.

27:30.079 --> 27:30.784
Well...

27:31.283 --> 27:34.069
I could always spill some
icy cold beverage on you.

27:34.804 --> 27:35.478
No, thanks.

27:35.479 --> 27:38.449
Um, look, can we just,
uh, have a seat here

27:38.450 --> 27:42.236
and, uh, drink some of
this icy cold champagne?

27:48.045 --> 27:49.236
Well, this is awkward.

27:49.237 --> 27:51.565
Well, I would understand if
you're having second thoughts.

27:51.566 --> 27:54.127
Well, I'm... I'm not
having second thoughts.

27:54.705 --> 27:56.681
Are you having second thoughts?

27:56.966 --> 27:59.023
Oh, my God. You're
having second thoughts?

27:59.024 --> 28:00.530
No, I-I just want to
make sure that we know

28:00.531 --> 28:02.274
what we're getting ourselves into.

28:02.275 --> 28:04.727
That's all. We're in
a hotel room, Karl.

28:04.728 --> 28:06.763
I'm naked here.
How could we not know

28:06.764 --> 28:09.141
what we're getting ourselves in for?
Please don't get upset.

28:09.142 --> 28:11.746
Well, I am upset. I am upset.

28:11.747 --> 28:14.035
My God. What is your problem? I...

28:14.036 --> 28:17.207
You invite me here to this hotel
and then you change your mind?

28:17.208 --> 28:19.937
I'm in a friggin' bathrobe
here for God sake.

28:19.938 --> 28:20.929
I just... can we just
talk this out, please?

28:20.930 --> 28:22.877
No, we can't talk it out.
We can't talk it out.

28:22.878 --> 28:24.971
I'm not one of your patients.
Just go, okay? Nora, I'm...

28:24.972 --> 28:26.928
Good-bye, Karl. Go.
I'm so... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:26.929 --> 28:29.069
I never... never intended...
you never intended?

28:29.070 --> 28:30.649
To what? I...

28:30.650 --> 28:34.967
To sleep with me? No, no.
No, I did. Yes, yes, yes.

28:34.968 --> 28:35.774
But it's...

28:37.568 --> 28:38.967
I ran into your daughter...

28:38.968 --> 28:40.362
My daughter? Sarah, in the lobby.

28:40.363 --> 28:41.181
She's here? Don't worry.

28:41.182 --> 28:42.604
I didn't tell her that
I was meeting you.

28:42.605 --> 28:44.621
I didn't. It's just... Nora...

28:44.940 --> 28:46.975
Your family is so
important to you,

28:46.976 --> 28:49.264
and there are just so many of them,
and... and I worry,

28:49.265 --> 28:51.254
if we... we take this
to the next level...

28:51.255 --> 28:53.584
So my family is too much for you?

28:53.585 --> 28:55.046
Once we do something like this...

28:55.047 --> 28:57.018
Like what, have sex? Yeah...

28:57.019 --> 29:00.620
My God, Karl. You are making
such a big deal out of this.

29:00.621 --> 29:03.997
People have been having sex
for thousands of years.

29:03.998 --> 29:05.775
Yes, I know that. Uh-huh.

29:06.027 --> 29:08.288
But there are just lot more
feelings at stake here,

29:08.289 --> 29:10.552
and it is a big deal,
I mean, which is why

29:10.553 --> 29:12.400
we have to be honest
about everything... Well,

29:12.401 --> 29:14.505
I am honest. I have been honest.

29:14.506 --> 29:18.866
I am not so sure about you.
I... wh-where are you going?

29:19.083 --> 29:20.632
Anywhere else but here.

29:21.806 --> 29:23.006
Oh, Karl.

29:23.898 --> 29:26.595
Just a sec. I hope you're alone.

29:29.388 --> 29:31.426
Mom. W-how did you...

29:31.427 --> 29:33.322
oh, God. This is awful.

29:33.483 --> 29:36.474
Oh, no. Did you follow him here?

29:36.475 --> 29:39.351
Well, it wasn't my idea to come here.
That's for damn sure.

29:39.352 --> 29:40.580
Wait. Why are you wearing a robe?

29:40.581 --> 29:42.763
Because it's more
embarrassing like this.

29:42.764 --> 29:45.530
Oh, no. Karl was meeting you here?

29:45.531 --> 29:47.474
Oh, I thought... what?

29:47.475 --> 29:49.266
Th-the only reason I
called the room was...

29:49.267 --> 29:52.259
You called the room? Sarah,
what did you say?

29:52.260 --> 29:55.601
Nothing. I just wanted to make
sure he didn't hurt you. Oh, God.

29:55.602 --> 29:57.601
You told him I was in
love with him, didn't you?

29:57.602 --> 30:01.015
No, no. I just said that
you liked him a lot.

30:01.016 --> 30:04.773
And then I physically threatened him,
I think. Oh, Sarah.

30:04.774 --> 30:07.594
I'm sorry, mom.
I think I really messed it up.

30:07.595 --> 30:08.991
Oh, God. I can't believe...

30:08.992 --> 30:12.540
Kitty, I-I can't, um,
I can't talk right now.

30:13.051 --> 30:14.871
What? No, just...

30:14.872 --> 30:17.456
That's where I am...
the Hotel Velone.

30:18.337 --> 30:19.616
Kitty's here, too?

30:20.261 --> 30:22.555
I'm feel... Mom?

30:22.556 --> 30:24.488
We're all here. Oh, God.

30:24.918 --> 30:26.847
I should just jump.
What floor are we on?

30:26.848 --> 30:27.752
Uh, eight.

30:27.753 --> 30:29.330
That ought to do it.

30:38.859 --> 30:41.021
Okay, okay. Thanks, hon.

30:41.605 --> 30:44.036
So the boys are happy
in Kitty's room.

30:44.037 --> 30:45.842
Hopefully, they will stay there.

30:46.161 --> 30:47.332
Thank you for getting rid of them.

30:47.333 --> 30:50.138
The last thing on earth I
wanted to look at right now

30:50.139 --> 30:52.654
is Kevin stoned out
of his gourd. Mm.

30:52.655 --> 30:55.190
There's a little bit more Cabernet.
Who wants it? Me.

30:55.531 --> 30:58.092
Give it to her. She gets
whatever she wants tonight.

30:58.118 --> 31:01.830
Well, at least I learned,
Karl is not interested in me

31:01.831 --> 31:05.074
sooner rather than later. Well,
he got you down to your robe.

31:05.075 --> 31:08.086
No, the pizza boy did that.
Pardon me?

31:08.087 --> 31:11.391
It's a long story, honey.
And it's fine.

31:12.318 --> 31:15.533
No, mom. It...
it's not. I meddled.

31:15.534 --> 31:17.422
I shouldn't have.
He told me not to.

31:17.695 --> 31:19.419
I-I messed everything up for you.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.005
I completely obliterated
your brand-new relationship.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.024
I'm so sorry.

31:24.051 --> 31:26.795
I'm not mad at you, honey.
I'm... I'm mad at Karl.

31:26.796 --> 31:28.176
Well, I'm mad at me.

31:28.855 --> 31:30.358
Our night is ruined.

31:30.958 --> 31:33.362
All I wanted was this
one perfect night,

31:33.737 --> 31:35.560
just the two of us,
before you went away.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.532
And now you're leaving.

31:36.533 --> 31:39.931
In 12 hours, you're gonna be on
a plane to China for 2 months.

31:39.932 --> 31:40.786
Oh, my God.

31:41.724 --> 31:43.273
And I don't want you to go.

31:45.336 --> 31:47.551
I mean, of course
I want you to go.

31:47.552 --> 31:49.472
It's an amazing opportunity.
I just...

31:50.814 --> 31:52.443
Well, honey, he'll be back.

31:52.444 --> 31:55.344
I know that, mom.
Oh, okay. Well...

31:57.305 --> 31:59.022
I just wish we had more time.

32:00.545 --> 32:01.340
Ooh.

32:01.557 --> 32:04.987
I got a text... from Karl.

32:04.988 --> 32:06.280
What? What does he say?

32:06.281 --> 32:09.575
"Wanna talk? Meet me
downstairs in the..."

32:10.781 --> 32:12.824
He can't even complete a text.

32:13.289 --> 32:14.635
Ooh. All right.

32:14.650 --> 32:16.558
"In the bar." Oh.

32:17.362 --> 32:18.258
Are you gonna go?

32:18.970 --> 32:21.456
No, of course not.
At least he's out of the room,

32:21.457 --> 32:23.929
and I can go put some clothes on.
Okay, mom. Bye.

32:23.930 --> 32:25.055
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

32:25.056 --> 32:27.246
As the only man here,
can I just say something?

32:27.925 --> 32:29.755
Men can be heartless, I know.

32:30.242 --> 32:33.444
But most of us,
we just act like fools.

32:33.729 --> 32:35.109
The better ones admit it.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.494
I think you should hear him out.

32:42.099 --> 32:43.741
God, I love pizza.

32:43.742 --> 32:45.890
Me gusta pizza, tambien.

32:45.891 --> 32:47.555
Don't do that! I'm kidding.

32:47.556 --> 32:49.160
I'm sorry. I just...
that's not funny.

32:49.161 --> 32:52.201
Oh! How the hell did
this happen to you?

32:52.202 --> 32:53.722
It was an accident.
Well, it wouldn't have happened

32:53.723 --> 32:55.027
if you weren't stuffing food

32:55.028 --> 32:57.340
down your throat this morning.
I was nervous.

32:57.628 --> 32:59.031
Kevin, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

32:59.032 --> 33:01.959
Kevin, the state of California
is not going to turn you down.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.589
Do you know how many
needy kids there are...

33:03.590 --> 33:05.209
Well, maybe that's
why I'm freaking out,

33:05.210 --> 33:07.125
because this is finally
going to happen.

33:07.126 --> 33:08.278
Oh, my God. I can't win with you.

33:08.279 --> 33:09.397
You're nervous we won't get a kid.

33:09.398 --> 33:12.114
You're nervous we will get a kid.
I'm a nervous guy, okay?

33:12.115 --> 33:13.904
Okay. Okay, okay.

33:14.142 --> 33:15.104
Could we order more pizza?

33:15.105 --> 33:17.074
Oh, I didn't even order it,
actually.

33:17.075 --> 33:18.299
Seth went out to get more...

33:18.300 --> 33:20.415
Pizza. Why'd you
send him home anyway?

33:20.416 --> 33:22.878
He neglected to tell me that
he's a student at Wexley.

33:22.952 --> 33:24.759
Oh, are you dating
one of your students?

33:24.760 --> 33:26.436
No. It's not illegal
to date a student

33:26.437 --> 33:27.809
so long as he's not your student.

33:27.810 --> 33:30.754
I'm a republican.
I'm a conservative.

33:30.755 --> 33:32.413
And according to dean Whitley,

33:32.414 --> 33:34.459
I'm a living testament
to family values.

33:34.460 --> 33:37.175
You know what I think? I think
you can feel whatever you want.

33:37.176 --> 33:39.337
So stop worrying about
whether conservative women

33:39.338 --> 33:41.349
should sleep with
20 year olds... 27.

33:41.350 --> 33:44.698
Or what the dean of family
values thinks of you.

33:45.624 --> 33:46.419
Live.

33:48.301 --> 33:48.972
Wow.

33:51.912 --> 33:54.991
Yeah. I think I'm finally sober.

34:02.492 --> 34:03.491
I got your text.

34:03.492 --> 34:06.830
Yeah, well, desperate times
call for desperate messaging.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.199
Can I get you a drink?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.262
No, thank you.

34:10.659 --> 34:13.761
But I will sit down, though.

34:15.272 --> 34:17.563
I had a glass of wine upstairs...

34:18.050 --> 34:19.308
a lovely Cabernet.

34:19.804 --> 34:21.458
Right. With, uh, Sarah.

34:21.458 --> 34:24.259
And Kevin and Scotty and Kitty.
They're all here?

34:24.260 --> 34:27.491
Yes. And I know,
there are so many of them.

34:27.492 --> 34:28.632
I'm sorry. I...

34:29.165 --> 34:30.927
I behaved horribly,

34:31.335 --> 34:33.806
which wouldn't be the first time.

34:37.148 --> 34:37.975
Okay.

34:39.922 --> 34:43.023
My... my ex-wife,

34:43.443 --> 34:44.554
hated Cabernet.

34:46.315 --> 34:48.920
She always complained
it was too jammy.

34:50.196 --> 34:52.092
Well, I didn't know you'd
been married before.

34:52.166 --> 34:54.558
Yeah, it lasted, uh, 18 months.

34:55.518 --> 34:56.260
What happened?

34:56.261 --> 34:58.207
Well, I didn't want any children.

34:58.208 --> 34:59.850
What, you mean you didn't
have that conversation

34:59.851 --> 35:01.546
before you decided to
walk down the aisle?

35:01.547 --> 35:03.219
You... you'd think,
but no, not really.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.842
You s... you see,
I-I have a difficult time

35:07.386 --> 35:09.531
expressing my feelings, so...

35:10.232 --> 35:12.072
Perhaps you should
seek professional help.

35:12.073 --> 35:14.678
I do. I do. I did. I just got
off the phone with my shrink.

35:14.679 --> 35:15.493
You're in therapy?

35:15.494 --> 35:18.381
Yeah. Yeah, same guy that I
saw when I lived in Chicago.

35:18.382 --> 35:22.120
We do a phoner once a week.
Really?

35:22.121 --> 35:23.191
Mm-hmm. That's interesting.

35:23.192 --> 35:26.327
And what offhand would
you say is your problem?

35:26.713 --> 35:30.976
Well... I don't exactly
have a great track record

35:30.977 --> 35:32.693
when it comes to intimacy.

35:32.694 --> 35:33.407
Ah.

35:33.408 --> 35:37.334
So when I heard that you...
like me...

35:37.335 --> 35:39.755
Oh, God. Oh, God.

35:39.756 --> 35:41.977
So what did...
Sarah told you what,

35:41.978 --> 35:45.385
I was falling for you?
Pretty much.

35:45.386 --> 35:47.487
Oh, God. Yeah, yeah,
when she... when she said that,

35:47.671 --> 35:50.234
you know, all my old
tapes started playing,

35:50.235 --> 35:52.666
and... and I... and I panicked...
No kidding.

35:52.667 --> 35:56.009
Yeah. Uh, but what I...
what I wanted to tell you...

35:56.010 --> 35:58.512
I mean, the reason
that I texted you...

35:58.977 --> 36:01.529
What scared me, I think, is...

36:02.543 --> 36:06.274
I... I might be
falling for you, too.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.058
Whew.

36:12.457 --> 36:15.065
What, did your shrink
help you realize that?

36:15.066 --> 36:15.967
Well, that

36:15.968 --> 36:19.450
and that I was an idiot
for suggesting a hotel.

36:20.309 --> 36:21.284
Yeah.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.401
Well, it was half off.

36:29.016 --> 36:29.979
You know, I...

36:30.838 --> 36:34.074
I never expected to meet
such an amazing woman.

36:34.348 --> 36:35.974
I mean, especially at
this point in my life,

36:35.975 --> 36:39.046
with all my little... oh, just stop.
No more words. Don't talk.

36:41.075 --> 36:41.700
Look...

36:45.160 --> 36:46.493
You know where I live.

36:46.992 --> 36:48.989
I make a hell of a roast chicken.

36:49.870 --> 36:52.357
If you'd like to come
over for dinner sometime,

36:52.358 --> 36:53.390
just the two of us,

36:53.391 --> 36:55.473
we could just...

36:56.264 --> 36:57.228
See how it goes.

37:01.931 --> 37:02.727
Text me.

37:05.127 --> 37:05.980
You know, I don't know about you,

37:05.981 --> 37:08.835
but, uh, I'm starving.

37:09.772 --> 37:10.396
Tonight?

37:10.397 --> 37:11.754
I love roast chicken.

37:24.715 --> 37:28.117
Hey. Okay, hey. Hi.
Good morning, everybody.

37:30.842 --> 37:32.998
This is a class about politics.

37:34.971 --> 37:36.047
What is it? I...

37:36.872 --> 37:38.222
That's a very good question.

37:38.223 --> 37:42.988
Um... politics is about
changing the world,

37:43.936 --> 37:44.923
one day at a time.

37:47.334 --> 37:47.826
Mm.

37:49.664 --> 37:50.481
It's the social worker.

37:51.407 --> 37:52.034
Hello.

37:52.330 --> 37:52.911
Yes.

37:54.017 --> 37:56.623
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
Is it... is it serious?

37:57.258 --> 37:59.134
What? Oh, of cour...
Yeah. No problem.

37:59.135 --> 37:59.970
What? Bye.

38:00.122 --> 38:00.782
What?

38:01.325 --> 38:02.871
Social worker has to reschedule.

38:02.872 --> 38:06.033
Apparently her kid's really sick.
After all that buildup?

38:06.034 --> 38:10.169
Yeah. Guess I should
go back to work.

38:10.658 --> 38:12.508
Wait. You know...

38:13.817 --> 38:17.875
We haven't had much
time lately for just us.

38:17.876 --> 38:18.842
That's true.

38:18.843 --> 38:22.335
And it hasn't been the
easiest couple of months. No.

38:22.336 --> 38:26.509
Right. So why don't you and
I check into a hotel room?

38:26.510 --> 38:29.751
No, not... no, it could be
like a little second honeymoon.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.682
We'd have to put
some serious distance

38:32.683 --> 38:34.810
between us and your family.

38:34.811 --> 38:36.138
Is Nepal far enough?

38:36.139 --> 38:39.602
No. But Vegas might be.

38:39.603 --> 38:42.322
I could call my sous chef
and she could cover for me.

38:42.584 --> 38:45.921
If we leave now...
we could be hours away

38:45.922 --> 38:48.204
before they even know
we're gone. Call her.

38:48.205 --> 38:50.102
Really? Yeah. Let's go.

38:50.103 --> 38:52.749
Okay. I have a great idea
of what we're gonna do.

38:58.182 --> 38:59.472
Réveiller, mon amour.

39:00.612 --> 39:01.575
What time is it?

39:02.355 --> 39:03.238
It's time for me to go.

39:03.239 --> 39:06.754
Oh, God, no.
I fell asleep. I'm sorry.

39:06.755 --> 39:08.448
You don't have to apologize.

39:10.274 --> 39:11.538
Last night was actually...

39:11.539 --> 39:14.048
A disaster. I was going
to say unforgettable.

39:14.049 --> 39:16.482
Well, it wasn't the happy
ending I was hoping for.

39:17.057 --> 39:18.517
I completely underestimated

39:18.518 --> 39:21.598
how much Scotty and
Kevin love old movies.

39:21.695 --> 39:23.656
Actually, that was my fault.

39:23.657 --> 39:26.139
I-I love Humphrey Bogart.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.128
I'm gonna miss you.

39:30.538 --> 39:32.053
Look, we'll get through this.

39:32.177 --> 39:33.399
I'm gonna call you every night.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.412
I'm gonna e-mail,
Skype, sex-text you.

39:37.146 --> 39:39.145
I'm gonna paint as fast as I can.

39:41.050 --> 39:41.879
I love you.

39:47.323 --> 39:49.479
How much time do you have exactly?

39:50.304 --> 39:52.245
The taxi will be
here in 20 minutes.

39:52.246 --> 39:54.332
Yeah? We'd have to be fast.

39:54.333 --> 39:55.622
I can do fast. Yeah?

39:57.593 --> 39:58.377
Nora.

40:03.125 --> 40:04.482
Good morning, sleepyhead.

40:05.015 --> 40:07.220
I don't remember
ordering room service.

40:07.221 --> 40:08.083
Well...

40:09.527 --> 40:10.749
You didn't have to.

40:12.176 --> 40:13.986
Oh, this is nice.

40:13.987 --> 40:15.261
Fresh berries

40:15.262 --> 40:16.795
and your coffee.

40:22.513 --> 40:24.497
Last night was wonderful.

40:24.760 --> 40:28.125
Mm. Well, you have
a grand hotel here.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.685
We make the magic and
we make the beds.

40:38.314 --> 40:39.143
Hi.

40:40.767 --> 40:41.185
Hey.

40:41.186 --> 40:45.345
Uh... wh... I didn't, uh,
expect to see you again.

40:45.877 --> 40:46.644
Well, like you said,

40:46.645 --> 40:50.369
you're only a couple of
blocks from campus, so I...

40:52.587 --> 40:53.181
Yeah.

40:54.063 --> 40:55.524
So, uh, how were those, uh,

40:55.525 --> 40:57.447
those young Wexley Republicans?

40:57.448 --> 40:59.360
I hear they can be
awfully judgmental.

40:59.361 --> 41:01.501
Oh, they're fine. They're fine.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.996
My... my problem is... is...

41:03.997 --> 41:05.183
is that I...

41:06.977 --> 41:07.840
I like you.

41:08.316 --> 41:09.479
And I was wondering

41:09.480 --> 41:12.013
what you think I
should do about that.

41:13.656 --> 41:14.440
Uh...

41:14.556 --> 41:17.877
So, uh, wow, you're... you're,
uh, asking me?

41:17.878 --> 41:20.065
No. No.

41:22.158 --> 41:23.406
Uh, if that's your phone number,

41:23.407 --> 41:25.488
I've already got it,
'cause you called me,

41:25.489 --> 41:27.729
so it's in my phone, you know? Oh,
no, I know. I know.

41:27.730 --> 41:30.989
I'just, um...
giving it to you again.
