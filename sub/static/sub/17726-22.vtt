WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:05.106
- Coming up on the three part
"Vanderpump Rules" Reunion...

00:05.139 --> 00:08.109
[club music]

00:08.142 --> 00:09.343
- I got Botox yesterday.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.611
Botox and facial.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.480
- Naked boys!
- Yeah.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.116
- I just happen to, like,
be naturally perfect.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.084
Like, that's the look
I'm going for.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.351
- Yeah, yeah.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.352
- No matter what,
you'll never like me.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.487
I don't understand it.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.222
- I watch you
manipulate people

00:21.255 --> 00:23.191
time and time again.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.458
- All right,
we're gonna slowly...

00:24.492 --> 00:25.559
de-robe.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.061
I'm getting so much
sh-- from you guys

00:27.095 --> 00:28.062
for saying sorry.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.130
- Come on, own your sh--.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.199
- I was afraid of you guys
being f---ing mean to me!

00:31.232 --> 00:32.500
both: That is bullsh--!

00:32.533 --> 00:33.501
- Well, I've always--
- This is ridiculous!

00:33.534 --> 00:35.103
[dramatic tone]

00:35.136 --> 00:38.372
- I just got a top-six
on my situation over here.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.373
- Five to places!

00:39.407 --> 00:40.508
Five to places, everybody!

00:40.541 --> 00:41.509
Thank you very much.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.144
- I swear, these tits...

00:43.177 --> 00:44.245
How 'bout staying in?
- [laughing]

00:44.278 --> 00:46.114
*

00:46.147 --> 00:47.515
- Former Sur staffer

00:47.548 --> 00:49.250
Lala will be here.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.384
*

00:50.418 --> 00:51.385
- How are you?

00:51.419 --> 00:52.386
- I'm nervous.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.654
Before you even knew me,

00:53.687 --> 00:55.123
you were calling me a whore
at all these people.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.257
You're a mean girl!

00:56.290 --> 00:58.126
Everything's
"I heard, I heard."

00:58.159 --> 01:00.394
Because of everything you've
heard and made up in your head,

01:00.428 --> 01:01.862
you really f---ed
with my life a lot.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.630
- Let me ask you this.
- So stop!

01:02.663 --> 01:03.331
- Have you spoken
to Shay at all?

01:03.364 --> 01:05.299
Do you think
he'll come today?

01:05.333 --> 01:06.434
- I haven't seen him
since the film.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.668
- Well,
I would've had a pre-nup

01:07.701 --> 01:10.171
if I'd been marrying Shay.
Let's be honest.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.705
- I had nothing
to lose at the time.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.307
I think he's gonna be
way more uncomfortable

01:13.341 --> 01:14.442
than I'm gonna feel.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.444
I have a room of
support and friends.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.579
I-I caught him
texting another girl.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.581
- I can't even look
at you right now.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.683
- Find your places, please!

01:22.716 --> 01:25.186
- Take one minute,
we're rolling on tape.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.720
Still last call.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.456
- It's time...

01:28.489 --> 01:30.724
to kick some serious butt.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.726
- Five, four, three.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.196
- Okay, guys,
the bitch is back.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.464
- Two...

01:36.497 --> 01:37.531
*

01:37.565 --> 01:41.702
- * Just raise
your glasses high *

01:41.735 --> 01:43.737
* This one is for you tonight

01:43.771 --> 01:45.706
- Hey, everyone, and welcome
to the "Vanderpump Rules"

01:45.739 --> 01:47.708
Season Five Reunion.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.578
I'm Andy Cohen here
in downtown Los Angeles

01:50.611 --> 01:53.314
with the empress of Sur herself,

01:53.347 --> 01:54.682
Lisa Vanderpump,

01:54.715 --> 01:57.451
and the staff of Sur,

01:57.485 --> 02:00.721
and some former Sur staffers.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.922
Hi, Lisa!

02:01.955 --> 02:02.656
- Hello, Andy.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.359
- We normally do this at Sur...

02:05.393 --> 02:07.228
but the group in the show--

02:07.261 --> 02:08.629
- Is getting bigger
and bigger and bigger!

02:08.662 --> 02:09.597
- Exactly,
so we had to move out.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.499
- Look at them.
I mean, we're multiplying.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.933
We're breeding, clearly.

02:12.966 --> 02:13.734
[chuckling]

02:13.767 --> 02:15.169
- Hey, Schwartz!
- What's up, Andy?

02:15.203 --> 02:16.170
How you doin'?

02:16.204 --> 02:17.371
- I cried at your vows.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.639
- Oh, my God.
That means a lot to me.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.640
It really does.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.941
- Hey, Katie!
- Hi!

02:20.974 --> 02:21.709
- How's married life?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.511
- It--
it's amazing, actually.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.945
- Let's see the rings.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.247
- They say
there's three rings.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.648
There's the engagement ring,

02:27.681 --> 02:29.517
there's the wedding ring,
and then there's suffering.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.752
[all laughing]

02:31.785 --> 02:33.387
- Oh, my God.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.389
- Perfect, perfect.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.790
- Here we go!
[chuckling]

02:36.824 --> 02:38.392
- Hi, Stassi!
- Hi!

02:38.426 --> 02:40.761
- I was amazed
at seeing on Instagram

02:40.794 --> 02:44.532
that you actually went on
the honeymoon with them.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.400
- I love you guys, too.

02:46.434 --> 02:49.803
Well, yeah, when you get
an invitation to Bora Bora,

02:49.837 --> 02:51.405
you don't turn it down.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.506
- Hey, Brittany!

02:52.540 --> 02:53.674
- Hi, Andy!
- Before we start,

02:53.707 --> 02:55.276
will you make me
a turkey sandwich?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.277
- I sure will.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.411
- Yeah?
- [chuckles]

02:57.445 --> 02:58.812
- Hi, Jax!
- Hi!

02:58.846 --> 03:01.582
- Last year at the reunion,
you were fresh off a felony.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.983
- Fresh off a felony, yes.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.718
- All clear, has that--
- Yeah, I'm all clear.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.320
- You are sitting
next to James

03:06.354 --> 03:08.289
so I want you to keep
your hands to yourself.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.423
- As of right now,
the record's clear.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.824
- Hi, James!
- Hello, how are you?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.693
- Good.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.696
Are you excited to be
next to Jax post-probation?

03:15.729 --> 03:16.830
- Uh, yeah.

03:16.864 --> 03:17.831
Why not?

03:17.865 --> 03:20.301
- I'm just saying,
the two of you actually--

03:20.334 --> 03:22.836
I mean, you both
have clefted chins.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.306
- They look--
- Which are both natural?

03:25.339 --> 03:26.307
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.308
- Well, James' is...

03:27.341 --> 03:28.576
but Jax...

03:28.609 --> 03:29.710
I don't know anything's
natural about that face.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.445
Is it natural?
- Moving on!

03:31.479 --> 03:33.447
[all laughing]

03:33.481 --> 03:34.848
- Hey, Ariana!
- Hi!

03:34.882 --> 03:36.250
- You wore a dress today.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.251
No suit.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.586
- No, I know.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.853
- You look good in a suit.
- Thank you.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.455
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

03:41.489 --> 03:42.456
- Hey, Tom Sandoval!

03:42.490 --> 03:43.591
- Hey, how's it going, Andy?

03:43.624 --> 03:44.558
- I love the fresh haircut.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.727
- Thanks, man.
I had to change it up, you know?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.729
- I was thinking you might
show up in a cocktail dress

03:48.762 --> 03:50.731
or a pencil skirt.
[laughter]

03:50.764 --> 03:51.832
- So was I, actually.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.467
- I can't even deal
with this sh--.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.336
Give me my f---ing vodka soda.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.837
- You are a pretty boy,

03:56.870 --> 03:59.340
but you are
a really pretty girl.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.341
- I was all right.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.642
The sunglasses helped.

04:01.675 --> 04:02.576
- Hey, Scheana!
- Hi!

04:02.610 --> 04:05.045
- I know you've been
going through it lately.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.647
Big life changes.
- Mm-hmm.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.648
- How're you doing?

04:07.681 --> 04:08.649
- Really good.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.784
- I love your hair, by the way.
- Thank you.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.521
New year, figured
I'm just gonna start fresh.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.656
chop it off, new look,
new man, you know?

04:15.689 --> 04:17.057
- New man?
- Yeah!

04:17.090 --> 04:18.659
- Okay, more on that later.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.662
So, the season
starts with a bang

04:21.695 --> 04:23.764
because here comes Jax Taylor.

04:23.797 --> 04:28.068
He blabs that he has seen
his girlfriend, Brittany,

04:28.101 --> 04:30.070
and his...

04:30.103 --> 04:32.640
I don't know how to
characterize Kristen to you.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.642
- Hi, is this our proper
hello, by the way?

04:34.675 --> 04:35.643
Hi.
- Oh, my God!

04:35.676 --> 04:36.910
Did I not say hello to you?
- No. [chuckles]

04:36.944 --> 04:38.646
- I am so sorry.
Hey, Kristen!

04:38.679 --> 04:39.647
- Hi, Andy.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.648
- Wow, you know,

04:40.681 --> 04:41.915
I kind of miss crazy Kristen.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.517
- She pops up
once in a while.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.785
- I have a feeling
I might see her today.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.387
- If you're lucky.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.922
- Jax, you've seen them
en flagrante.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.791
What--
what did you witness?

04:50.824 --> 04:52.926
- Um, you know, I was
coming back from a late night.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.595
I was working at Sur.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.797
Saw Carter passed out on
my couch so I was like, okay,

04:56.830 --> 04:57.931
well, where's everybody else?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.534
So I opened my door and, uh,

05:00.568 --> 05:03.337
Kristen popped up
between Brittany and...

05:03.371 --> 05:04.338
- [chuckling]

05:04.372 --> 05:05.606
Popped up?
[laughs]

05:05.639 --> 05:06.807
- Like a gopher.
- So you saw them?

05:06.840 --> 05:07.841
What did you say?
What did they say?

05:07.875 --> 05:08.842
- We got in an argument,
and I said--

05:08.876 --> 05:09.943
- That's my Kentucky muffin!

05:09.977 --> 05:11.479
Don't you move on
to her like that.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.613
[laughter]
- To be honest,

05:12.646 --> 05:13.814
after that,
it was kind of, like,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.516
just a lot screaming
going on back and forth.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.617
Uh...

05:16.650 --> 05:18.452
you know, Kristen ended up
grabbing Carter and leaving.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.853
I went to bed,
got up the next morning.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.854
There was a little
arguing again.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.690
I left,
went to Tom's house...

05:22.723 --> 05:23.757
and I'm like this,

05:23.791 --> 05:25.726
"You're not gonna believe
what happened last night."

05:25.759 --> 05:26.794
- Kristen, moment of truth!

05:26.827 --> 05:28.562
- Yeah?

05:28.596 --> 05:29.830
- Did you go down on Brittany?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.665
- I did not
go down on Brittany.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.833
Didn't happen.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.702
- James, you know
Kristen pretty well.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.703
Is she telling the truth?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.705
- I honestly believe...

05:37.738 --> 05:39.807
uh, Jax with this one.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.709
- Uh, now I don't care.
- I just think Kristen likes

05:41.742 --> 05:42.810
getting with people
while her...

05:42.843 --> 05:44.712
like, boyfriend's in
the other room.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.813
- Tom!
- Like--

05:45.846 --> 05:47.381
- You think that's her thing?

05:47.415 --> 05:48.682
- I mean, it's
third time's the charm.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.950
- Did she do it with you?
- Uh, I did it to Tom.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.719
Jax did it to Tom.
- Yeah, so Jax,

05:51.752 --> 05:52.853
- They did it with Brittany.
- Maybe this is, like--

05:52.886 --> 05:53.821
just like a piece of
your own medicine?

05:53.854 --> 05:54.988
- She did it to Carter.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.457
- Don't talk about
my boyfriend, James.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.825
- It might just be
Kristen's thing.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.926
- Don't even let Carter's name
leave your f---ing lips.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.828
- Carter, Carter,
Carter, Carter.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.863
- Brittany, what did happen?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.865
- We were just drunk
and did a stupid kiss

06:04.898 --> 06:05.699
that was stupid as it is.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.601
- But you were
laying in bed naked.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.002
- Okay, no, we weren't.
- We're not naked--

06:09.036 --> 06:10.604
- You had nothing on!
- No, I didn't!

06:10.638 --> 06:11.672
- Why else are you gonna say,

06:11.705 --> 06:12.973
"Get out of the room, let me
put my clothes back on."

06:13.006 --> 06:14.742
- Do you have any remorse...

06:14.775 --> 06:17.478
about spreading either...

06:17.511 --> 06:19.747
at worst, a rumor...

06:19.780 --> 06:20.881
or, at best...

06:20.914 --> 06:23.016
something very salacious...

06:23.050 --> 06:25.018
about your girlfriend,

06:25.052 --> 06:27.621
whose family is conservative.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.889
- You know what?
I'm gonna live my life

06:28.922 --> 06:30.458
the way I'm gonna live my life.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.625
I'm gonna talk about
what I wanna talk about--

06:31.659 --> 06:32.893
- Okay.
- If I was to sugarcoat things--

06:32.926 --> 06:33.894
- So that means no?
- Okay, so,

06:33.927 --> 06:34.928
do you have any remorse?

06:34.962 --> 06:35.929
- I guess I was just in shock.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.631
I didn't know what to do,

06:37.665 --> 06:38.899
and the first thing I usually
do when something's wrong

06:38.932 --> 06:39.633
is I run to these two.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.869
So it was just
initial reaction.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.004
- Why are you guys rolling
around in bed, making out?

06:44.037 --> 06:46.006
- It was a stupid,
drunken kiss.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.510
And I don't even know how
it even frickin' went down.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.778
It was stupid--
- I know how it went down.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.879
I saw you, you were down.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.781
[laughter]
She was going down.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.784
- I'm not gonna keep up
a lie for this whole time

06:56.817 --> 06:58.519
if I'm not telling the truth.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.887
That's not my personality.
That's not what I do.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.790
- I'm gonna close the door
on this conversation.

07:02.823 --> 07:03.924
- That's a great idea.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.926
- This summer,
we saw Katie and Tom

07:05.959 --> 07:07.928
plan their woodsy wedding.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.931
Katie, were you aware
of how much went into

07:10.964 --> 07:12.833
planning a wedding
before you started?

07:12.866 --> 07:13.634
- No.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.703
I'd planned, like,
small parties,

07:15.736 --> 07:17.070
but there's so many
things to consider--

07:17.104 --> 07:18.238
- And let's be honest.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.673
I love you, Tom,
let's be honest,

07:19.707 --> 07:21.542
but Katie did 99.9%
of the work.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.743
- Oh, most brides do.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.812
- Tom, you kept saying that
you could throw a whole wedding

07:24.845 --> 07:26.814
for what Katie spent
on invitations.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.949
What do you think your wedding
would have looked like?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.818
- I didn't know any better.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.686
I honestly thought I could
pull the whole thing together

07:32.720 --> 07:33.787
in a week for,
like, ten grand.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.955
And I was...
- You're--

07:34.988 --> 07:36.089
- Horribly mistaken.
- You're high.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.091
- I mean,
that is a true statement.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.961
- One of the most
revolting things this season

07:40.994 --> 07:44.565
was Schwartz asking the guys
to be his groomsmen...

07:44.598 --> 07:48.836
over a meal of butt-steaks
marinated in Schwartz.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.571
- That was--
- Ew.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.573
- That was really good, dude.
- Jax, how did that...

07:52.606 --> 07:53.574
butt-steak taste?

07:53.607 --> 07:54.708
- It tasted good.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.109
I'm not gonna lie,
it was good.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.579
- It went straight from
the butt crack into our mouth.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.713
- Ew!

07:59.747 --> 08:00.948
- Dude!
- What the--

08:00.981 --> 08:02.616
What is that, dude?

08:02.650 --> 08:03.884
- What is that thing in
the butt cheek in the middle?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.586
- It's your steak,
motherf---er.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.754
- It was a thick cut,

08:06.787 --> 08:08.756
so you really had to clench
your butt cheeks tightly--

08:08.789 --> 08:10.758
- It was like a work out.
- 'Cause gravity's pulling down

08:10.791 --> 08:11.892
on that hunk of meat.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.861
- Lisa,
these are your servers.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.995
- I know, right?

08:15.028 --> 08:16.997
The standard is high.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.299
- So I want to talk
about the bridesmaids.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.701
Uh...

08:20.734 --> 08:21.902
- Bridesmaids!
together: Hoo-ha-ha!

08:21.935 --> 08:22.970
- Nice.
[chuckling]

08:23.003 --> 08:24.304
- I thought I'd never
hear that again.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.306
- Stassi, after...

08:26.339 --> 08:29.910
being in the doghouse
with Katie for so long...

08:29.943 --> 08:32.913
uh, how much did it mean
to you to be a bridesmaid?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.315
- I don't really think
I could articulate it even.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.918
It made, like, all of those
moments this summer, like,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.921
that much more emotional
and that much more important,

08:40.954 --> 08:44.625
and I wanted to cater
to her every need

08:44.658 --> 08:45.893
the whole entire
summer because...

08:45.926 --> 08:47.628
- Wow.
- I felt really grateful.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.897
- Katie,
when Tom asked for a pre-nup,

08:49.930 --> 08:53.767
was that at all a sign to you
that he was having doubts?

08:53.801 --> 08:54.702
- Truthfully, no.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.904
It's something that,
just because I was so...

08:56.937 --> 09:00.941
caught up in just the planning
that I didn't think about that,

09:00.974 --> 09:03.577
or had considered it, but
I think it's just important

09:03.611 --> 09:05.579
to sort of have that...

09:05.613 --> 09:07.848
you know, relationship or
marriage insurance, if you will.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.950
- Lisa, what are
your thoughts on pre-nups?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.853
Good--good business
or bad romance?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.855
- Well, I don't see
what they had to share.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.591
I mean, they were arguing over
50 bucks for God's sake.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.593
- Scheana, you went
out of your way to say

09:19.627 --> 09:20.961
that you would never
get a pre-nup.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.063
Is that something
that you regret now?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.832
- No, I don't regret it.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.801
At the time, it did seem like
it would put a slight damper

09:27.835 --> 09:29.803
on how happy we were.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.939
- Well, I would've had a pre-nup
if I'd been marrying Shay.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.807
Let's be honest.
- Why?

09:33.841 --> 09:36.376
- Because he didn't pull
his weight in the relationship.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.379
So I would've done a pre-nup
with me getting 99%

09:39.412 --> 09:40.413
and you getting diddley squat.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.383
- I had nothing to lose
at the time so there was--

09:43.416 --> 09:45.853
yeah, the future, but I--
I was looking at a future

09:45.886 --> 09:48.088
with him for the rest
of my life, and not...

09:48.121 --> 09:50.090
me and my money.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.792
*

09:52.860 --> 09:54.928
- What does that do
to a man's self-esteem

09:54.962 --> 09:57.197
to be told that his dick
doesn't work?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.966
- She caught me
with a haymaker.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.000
'Cause it's not true,
my penis works.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.134
Jax, tell them.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.202
[laughter]

10:06.139 --> 10:08.208
[upbeat music]

10:08.241 --> 10:10.077
We are back with
the "Vanderpump Rules" Reunion.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.344
I'm Andy Cohen.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.347
A few things have changed
since we wrapped.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.783
Jax and Brittany,

10:15.816 --> 10:17.317
you moved apartments,
didn't you?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.652
- Mm-hmm.
- We did.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.787
- Where did you move?

10:19.820 --> 10:22.089
- Well...
- [chuckles]

10:22.122 --> 10:25.092
- These are our new neighbors.
- Yeah, they're neighbors!

10:25.125 --> 10:26.326
- Not only are we neighbors...

10:26.359 --> 10:27.661
- Same floor.
- We're on the same floor.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.096
- Are you kidding?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.665
- Oh. My. Gosh.
- I was so mean to them.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.300
- Not too happy about it.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.068
- I was gonna be, like, you know
what, is this a bad idea?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.203
And then I was, like,
talking about it with him,

10:36.236 --> 10:37.270
and Sandoval's, like, dude,
just f---ing move in there,

10:37.304 --> 10:38.405
who gives a f---.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.107
- You did it because
it was a bad idea.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.308
- I was, like, you know what?
I'm doing it, I'm moving

10:41.341 --> 10:42.342
in there.
- Sandoval said that?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.311
- Good question.
- Yeah, I talked him into it.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.279
- Did you do it because
it was a bad idea?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.280
- Well, I mean--
- Yeah, you're like,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.282
"This'll be fun. I'm gonna
f--- with everyone."

10:49.316 --> 10:50.751
[chuckles]
- I said--I was, like,

10:50.784 --> 10:52.152
I don't want this
to be, like, a dorm...

10:52.185 --> 10:53.887
- It is a dorm.
- Situation, um, you know?

10:53.921 --> 10:56.289
- Brittany, did Jax
consult you about the move,

10:56.323 --> 10:58.158
or did he just tell you
you were moving?

10:58.191 --> 11:01.328
- Well, Jax kind of went crazy
at our apartment complex

11:01.361 --> 11:03.463
that we lived at before...

11:03.496 --> 11:06.099
so it was kind of, like,
a rush, we had to move out.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.234
- What does that mean,
"he went crazy?"

11:07.267 --> 11:08.235
- He went crazy?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.237
- So we're down there
talking about it because

11:10.270 --> 11:11.504
our air conditioning
unit overflowed,

11:11.538 --> 11:14.374
ruined a bunch of our carpet,
furniture, and things like that.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.377
And they weren't working with
us, so Jax has a short temper,

11:17.410 --> 11:19.379
a short fuse,
so he just started...

11:19.412 --> 11:21.381
screaming at the people
down at the office,

11:21.414 --> 11:22.816
and he had to leave,

11:22.850 --> 11:24.351
and then I was sent
there to deal with it,

11:24.384 --> 11:26.353
and it was kind of,
like, move out papers.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.355
- You got evicted
from your apartment?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.357
- No, no, we didn't
get evicted, Brittany.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.225
We didn't get evicted.
- We didn't get evicted,

11:32.259 --> 11:33.226
it was just--
- I said, you know what?

11:33.260 --> 11:34.895
No, we're not upgrading.
We're out of this place.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.163
We're giving our month's
notice right now.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.330
Brittany, let's go,
we're out of here.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.131
- We got the move out
papers that day.

11:38.165 --> 11:38.999
- Yeah, don't--
- So it kind of--

11:39.032 --> 11:40.400
It kind of--
- Very clear about that.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.102
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

11:42.135 --> 11:43.336
It was our decision, but--
- It was my decision.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.471
- It was fed up.
- But I made it happen that day.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.239
- Sounds like it.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.476
Okay, I want to talk about
everyone's favorite DJ...

11:49.509 --> 11:51.378
James Kennedy.

11:51.411 --> 11:55.115
James, when the season started,
you were Lisa's star DJ.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.349
You--how many nights a week

11:56.383 --> 11:57.818
were you spinning
at Sur and Pump?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.386
- Five nights.
- Five nights?

11:59.419 --> 12:00.888
- Five nights.
- He was doing a good job.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.289
Until he screwed up.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.291
- Do DJs typically...

12:04.324 --> 12:06.293
get in so many...
- No.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.328
- Fights?
- No, I was, uh,

12:08.361 --> 12:10.864
definitely in a different
headspace than I am now then,

12:10.898 --> 12:12.866
and, um...
- You've learned how to say no

12:12.900 --> 12:15.168
to people when they come
and buy you shots, right?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.403
When you're behind the--
- It's called self-control.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.305
- You have zero self-control.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.307
Let's not get this twisted.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.310
- Well, James was
in such high demand.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.178
You spun at World Dog Day,

12:25.212 --> 12:26.546
and you also
were making some

12:26.579 --> 12:28.281
"Pick Up Your Poop"
announcements.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.283
[laughter]
- That was so funny.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.419
- Ladies and gentlemen,
just a reminder,

12:32.452 --> 12:35.322
make sure
you pick up your poop.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.290
Pick up your dog's poop.
Thank you.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.192
- I had a good time with that--

12:39.226 --> 12:42.195
- Jax, what did you think
of James' set list that day?

12:42.229 --> 12:44.197
- I personally--
- Drivin' him crazy.

12:44.231 --> 12:45.398
[chuckling]

12:45.432 --> 12:47.200
- "Feeling You"
was on repeat all day.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.401
- That song
was annoying me the most.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.569
- It kept playing.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.304
- All original music,
I might add to that.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.272
- Yeah.
- Is it one song?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.406
Or, like, ten songs?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.175
- Uh, it's
my Pump Sessions album.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.276
And then a couple of singles.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.545
- Pump Sessions album!

12:58.578 --> 13:00.313
James, are you
texting right now?

13:00.347 --> 13:01.815
- You haven't talked about
the album once,

13:01.849 --> 13:02.816
and I'm upset about it.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.284
- You're kidding right now?

13:04.317 --> 13:05.352
- Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding me right now?

13:05.385 --> 13:06.820
- I would just ask.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.822
- Are you kidding me
right now?

13:08.856 --> 13:09.823
[laughter]

13:09.857 --> 13:11.258
- Plug, plug, plug, plug!

13:11.291 --> 13:12.826
- He finally got to talk
about it on the reunion.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.494
- I'm gonna download it.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.831
So, World Dog Day, obviously
an important event for you.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.834
- World Dog Day was about
celebrating dogs.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.503
It was also, inadvertently,
to draw attention...

13:23.536 --> 13:26.840
to the dog torture, and we had
a few people speak about that.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.408
But it was very successful.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.378
- I can always mark
the start of summer, Lisa...

13:31.411 --> 13:33.613
by the shorts getting shorter,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.615
the days getting longer,

13:35.648 --> 13:39.386
and a new Porsche appearing
in front of Sur.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.488
Do you get a new Porsche
every summer?

13:41.521 --> 13:44.391
- Well, I don't want to drive
that car through the winter.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.658
- Is there winter here?

13:45.692 --> 13:48.395
- Yeah, have you seen the rain
we've had the last two months?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.363
- You can't drive your Porsche

13:50.397 --> 13:52.365
in the wetlands of
Beverly Hills?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.367
- You know what, I--
- In the winter?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
[laughter]
- Where am I?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.404
- Listen, I work hard for it.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.406
Don't knock it, okay?
- No, I'm not, I love it.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.341
- What do you drive
for the summer, huh?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.344
- Katie, what exactly
did Tom say to make you

14:04.377 --> 14:07.047
so enraged at
the Porsche dealership?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.582
- He jumped to
the convenient narrative that,

14:09.616 --> 14:11.351
you know, oh, it's
Tequila Katie's fault.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.553
So whatever I'm feeling
doesn't matter anymore.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.023
- What does that do
to a man's self-esteem

14:16.056 --> 14:17.958
to be told that his dick
doesn't work?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.459
- I know.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.028
- It doesn't make me wanna
run home and then be, like,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.562
"Damn, I can't wait
to f--- you later."

14:22.595 --> 14:24.331
- It was out of left field.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.466
I did not see it coming.
[laughter]

14:26.499 --> 14:27.901
She caught me with a haymaker.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.437
I didn't really know
how to respond.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.040
It just caught me off guard,
and it--and I laughed at it

14:33.073 --> 14:34.474
'cause it's not true.
My penis works.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.475
Jax, tell them.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.478
[laughter]

14:38.511 --> 14:40.914
- It wasn't meant to be--
- Well, I'm glad to hear...

14:40.948 --> 14:42.449
that your dick works.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.452
I want to change the subject
to something serious.

14:45.485 --> 14:49.489
Uh, the entire Sur community
was hit hard on Gay Pride.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.360
It happened the morning after
the terrible killings...

14:53.393 --> 14:54.594
- Shooting in Orlando.
- In Orlando.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.329
- Pulse Nightclub.
- Talk to me about that.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.565
- Well, I woke up
that morning and I saw,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.500
you know, what transpired.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.403
We were all very excited
for the day.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.505
LA Pride's one of the biggest,
if not the biggest,

15:05.538 --> 15:07.407
day in West Hollywood.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.111
When I saw what transpired,
I was just so devastated

15:11.144 --> 15:14.514
as an advocate for
the gay community and LGBTQ.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.516
And then,
something inside of me,

15:16.549 --> 15:18.018
I just went,
you know what?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.152
F--- it.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.121
We're gonna stand strong,
and we're gonna have courage

15:21.154 --> 15:22.990
in the face of adversity,
and...

15:23.023 --> 15:24.992
I remember, as I jumped off
the bus afterwards,

15:25.025 --> 15:26.994
and I--I felt
I couldn't sit down

15:27.027 --> 15:29.129
without addressing
everybody in Pump...

15:29.162 --> 15:33.000
and thanking them for being
united, for showing unity.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.534
We unite.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.637
We stand defiantly in the face
of a heinous act like that.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.106
[cheering]

15:39.139 --> 15:41.408
- I was very inspired
by that, Lisa.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.976
Like, that really
touched me, like, I--

15:43.010 --> 15:45.112
and I just wanted to be--
- That was so emotional

15:45.145 --> 15:46.379
with these two.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.415
I saw...

15:48.448 --> 15:51.518
very much the relationship
of how we--

15:51.551 --> 15:52.986
I fought with them.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.388
I give him the hardest time,
and I enjoy it,

15:55.422 --> 15:56.990
and I enjoyed
digging into him.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.125
But you saw, suddenly,

15:58.158 --> 16:00.727
these three people have been
through so much together,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.962
and I--I wanted
to really thank them.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.468
Fifty people lost their lives.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.469
[sniffles]
- Yeah, it's--

16:09.502 --> 16:11.471
- What do we do?
We go home...

16:11.504 --> 16:13.473
and let them win?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.208
Or we stand strong.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.477
And if they wanted to follow me,
then it was up to them.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.446
But I didn't blame
any of them for going home.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.181
- Katie, you chose not to--

16:21.214 --> 16:22.482
to--to go in.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.583
Why?
- I mean, it had just been

16:23.616 --> 16:28.488
mere hours, so trying to
just wrap my head around...

16:28.521 --> 16:30.490
the tragedy that happened,

16:30.523 --> 16:33.593
and hearing that
there was a man pulled over

16:33.626 --> 16:35.495
and arrested with guns, and...

16:35.528 --> 16:36.663
I was, like, beside myself.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.599
- I walked to Katie and
Schwartz's house with my dogs,

16:39.632 --> 16:42.202
and I was terrified because

16:42.235 --> 16:44.604
yeah, there were tanks--
- Helicopters--

16:44.637 --> 16:46.206
- I totally understand that.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.741
But that day was
an unbelievable success

16:48.775 --> 16:50.743
because
so many people came out

16:50.777 --> 16:52.512
that maybe wouldn't
have come out...

16:52.545 --> 16:53.580
- Right.
- In support of

16:53.613 --> 16:55.182
the LGBT community,

16:55.215 --> 16:56.716
and I'm glad
I made that decision

16:56.749 --> 16:58.185
because f--- terrorism.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.186
- Yeah.
- That's what we've got to do.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.221
And when we're faced with
something like that,

17:01.254 --> 17:03.223
we've gotta unite and--
and stand strong.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.525
- Kristen, what did you think
when you saw Tom

17:05.558 --> 17:06.759
taking his shirt off
on the bar?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.762
[dance music]

17:09.796 --> 17:11.764
[cheering]

17:11.798 --> 17:14.501
- We see this text...

17:14.534 --> 17:17.237
of, like, Ariana's ass,
and Tom shirtless on the bar,

17:17.270 --> 17:18.105
and we got--
- Yeah, and we're--

17:18.138 --> 17:19.639
we were just, like,
at home crying,

17:19.672 --> 17:20.773
and it just--
- Jax.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.542
- The juxtaposition of that--

17:22.575 --> 17:23.776
we didn't understand.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.645
- Katie sent a text message
saying, like,

17:25.678 --> 17:28.648
I'm sure there's
better ways to, like...

17:28.681 --> 17:31.784
celebrate the day besides
pouring shots down somebody.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.553
It was a very snotty--
- Yeah, that was

17:33.586 --> 17:34.521
in poor taste.
- Text message.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.522
- That was in very poor taste.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.257
- We got this text.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.791
Like, there's
no reason for that.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.660
It was a dig.
- Yeah, that's f---ed up.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.495
- That was unnecessary.
- It really was.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.631
- They're huddled
in the apartment...

17:44.664 --> 17:46.466
trying to one-up
the other one

17:46.499 --> 17:47.567
on how sad they are.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.536
- It felt like--I felt like
it was us, it was, like,

17:49.569 --> 17:50.403
oh, we're here having fun and
you guys are sitting at home,

17:50.437 --> 17:52.172
so I was like--
- We didn't do that.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.440
- Well, I'm sure there's
other things that we can do

17:53.473 --> 17:55.642
to show that rather than pouring
alcohol down someone's throat.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.544
- It wasn't about
us having fun.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.546
It was about everybody
at Pride having fun.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.582
I'm a straight, white...

18:02.615 --> 18:05.718
cisgender person
who has a lot of privilege,

18:05.752 --> 18:09.722
and I feel like there are people
in the LGBTQ community who--

18:09.756 --> 18:12.325
it is an act of bravery
every single day for them,

18:12.359 --> 18:15.328
and I felt like I couldn't
really call myself an ally

18:15.362 --> 18:17.597
if I didn't really
just, like...

18:17.630 --> 18:19.332
stand there with them.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.733
Why wouldn't I go?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.335
- What does the Q mean in that?

18:22.369 --> 18:23.703
- Questioning.
- It's--

18:23.736 --> 18:25.172
- Which is you.
- So it's basically...

18:25.205 --> 18:26.173
I'm the Q.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.175
[chuckling]

18:28.208 --> 18:29.576
- Okay, I want to move on.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.578
Former Sur hostess Lala Kent

18:31.611 --> 18:33.180
will be joining us,

18:33.213 --> 18:34.714
as well as...

18:34.747 --> 18:36.283
- What?
[laughs]

18:36.316 --> 18:38.718
- I just knew yesterday
she was in New York.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.853
- Well, she's
in Los Angeles today.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.289
- Oh, she's back?
- Yeah.

18:42.322 --> 18:43.723
- She's got a private jet so--
- Um...

18:43.756 --> 18:46.293
When we come back,
Lala joins the party.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.261
After this.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.167
[upbeat music]

18:54.201 --> 18:55.668
- Back in Los Angeles with

18:55.702 --> 18:57.704
the "Vanderpump Rules" Reunion,

18:57.737 --> 18:59.439
and we're joined by...

18:59.472 --> 19:02.242
the former Sur hostess,

19:02.275 --> 19:03.643
Lala Kent.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.212
- Hi.
- Great to see you.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.213
- Good to see you, too.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.214
- I love your hair.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.217
- Thank you, papi.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.219
- Uh, I like that, too.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.621
Did you not used to have a...

19:14.654 --> 19:16.356
tattoo?

19:16.389 --> 19:17.624
- I have a giant one here.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.359
I got one around my nipple.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.760
- What's around your nipple?
- With a lion?

19:20.793 --> 19:22.362
- A heart.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.730
I have my dog's name,

19:23.763 --> 19:25.232
Heathen, on the back.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.499
My mom calls me
her little heathen.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.734
- Wow. All right.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.738
Um, Katie, how did your feud
with Lala start?

19:31.771 --> 19:34.507
- I felt that...

19:34.541 --> 19:36.243
it was unprovoked by me.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.777
Uh, the last time
I had seen her

19:37.810 --> 19:40.780
was at my engagement party
that she...

19:40.813 --> 19:43.383
kind of, more or less,
acted like a drunken asshole.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.252
- Can we wrap it up?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.719
What the f---
are you talking about?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.721
- Wrap it up,
wrap it up, wrap it up.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.357
- That's ghetto as sh--.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.758
- And then, I didn't
see her or talk to her,

19:51.791 --> 19:54.761
but she was talking
a lot about me.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.630
My weights.
My relationship.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.767
Wanting to f--- my fiancé.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.369
His dick size.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.736
Regretting that she didn't
take his top off more,

20:03.770 --> 20:05.372
Katie is a blob.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.640
I think...
no sex Teletubby.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.775
Whatever you called me.

20:08.808 --> 20:09.776
- Before you even knew me,

20:09.809 --> 20:11.511
you were calling me a whore
at all these people,

20:11.544 --> 20:12.779
showing them
my profile picture.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.514
- If your--
if your naked ass

20:14.547 --> 20:16.383
is your profile picture,

20:16.416 --> 20:18.251
maybe you've booked
a job in Italy,

20:18.285 --> 20:19.519
but it's probably
not modeling.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.753
- So guess what?

20:20.787 --> 20:22.655
You said things about me
before you even knew me.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.757
You're a mean girl.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.293
You're mean.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.727
- Lala, I want to
talk to you about...

20:27.760 --> 20:29.729
some of the things that
you've said--

20:29.762 --> 20:31.030
- Mm-hmm.
- And find out why

20:31.063 --> 20:32.365
you said them.
- Okay.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.500
- Umm...

20:33.533 --> 20:35.735
you said Tom Schwartz
has a big D.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.036
- Well, that's just a fact.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.638
I mean, that's--
[all laughing]

20:38.671 --> 20:39.739
- How did you know that?
- That's public knowledge.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.041
- How did you know that?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.377
- A lot of stuff
has come out of this mouth.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.379
- You called Stassi old.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.748
She was 27 at the time.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.783
- Did I call her old?
- Yes.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.785
- She said the way Stassi
dressed was like a grandma.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.654
- Oh, the way
she dresses was grandma.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.055
- She went on
a podcast saying that

20:56.088 --> 20:57.657
all of us were old has-beens,

20:57.690 --> 20:59.792
we're boring, and that
you're the star of the show

20:59.826 --> 21:01.861
and the reason why Season Four--
- "Lala rules."

21:01.894 --> 21:04.864
- Was so successful,
and we better watch out.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.467
- But also, Stassi, you did
say that about yourself,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.836
Season Two, that you were
the star of the show.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.571
- I've also had to
answer for it.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.805
- Yeah.
- So now it's her turn

21:12.839 --> 21:14.441
to answer for it.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.708
- Lala,
as Katie and Tom

21:15.742 --> 21:17.310
were planning
their dream wedding,

21:17.344 --> 21:20.713
you said,
with some authority...

21:20.747 --> 21:23.583
Katie and Schwartz
will get divorced.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.585
Why would you say that?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.320
- Because
I think that will happen.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.521
- You do?
- Yeah.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.323
- You know us
very well, don't you?

21:30.357 --> 21:32.325
And our relationship,
and the ins and outs, and--

21:32.359 --> 21:33.826
- Just like
you know mine, right?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.728
- Well, I would--
- Watch yourself real quick.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.597
- I haven't--
- Watch yourself real quick.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.865
- Is that a threat?

21:38.898 --> 21:40.333
- Why is that your observation?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.601
- I think she's just
trying to hurt them.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.735
I honestly don't think--
- Statistically speaking.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.471
- That she can speak
from experience.

21:44.504 --> 21:48.475
- I just think marriage is
a really long-term commitment.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.710
I probably don't think
that I could make it.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.712
- But that's not why
you were saying it.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.514
You were saying it to hurt her.
- No, I say things to be hurtful

21:54.547 --> 21:56.749
because I feel like I tried
so hard with this group,

21:56.783 --> 21:57.917
but at the same time,

21:57.950 --> 22:00.853
I just sometimes need
people to ease off.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.823
If I come to you and I say,
"I'm sorry."

22:03.856 --> 22:05.592
If you keep coming at me,

22:05.625 --> 22:06.826
I'm gonna get
more and more hurt,

22:06.859 --> 22:08.595
and I'm not saying
that it's right,

22:08.628 --> 22:11.731
but I'm just saying why
the series of events happened

22:11.764 --> 22:12.799
the way that they did.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.734
- Lala, you walked into Sur,
and you walked around

22:14.767 --> 22:16.436
parading yourself...
- Look at your attitude.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.804
- As a badass bitch...
- It's your attitude.

22:17.837 --> 22:18.738
- Who wants to f--- everyone.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.407
No wonder we had
a weird thought about you.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.409
- I walk around going,
"I'm feeling extra

22:22.442 --> 22:23.810
hoochy tonight."
It's a freaking joke.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.678
The fact that you guys can't
sit there and be, like,

22:25.712 --> 22:26.779
"Oh, my God, she's a whore."

22:26.813 --> 22:28.915
It's, like--
it's so weird to me.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.417
Like, it's so odd.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.651
I don't get you guys at all.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.619
- Because it was fun
for them to hate on Lala.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.886
- It was, and you know what?
- It was fun.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.788
- James,
you hated on her, too,

22:35.822 --> 22:37.657
until you f---ed her.
You did so...

22:37.690 --> 22:38.891
- Are you out of your mind?

22:38.925 --> 22:40.527
Could you not?
- Kristen, how dare you?

22:40.560 --> 22:41.794
- Stop being mean.
Stop being mean.

22:41.828 --> 22:42.895
- One thing
that really bothers me

22:42.929 --> 22:44.764
about all three of you guys...

22:44.797 --> 22:47.400
is that
you take no accountability

22:47.434 --> 22:48.901
for all the sh--
you've said about her.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.670
You act, like, "Oh, my gosh,

22:50.703 --> 22:52.672
"Lala just came up to me
out of nowhere and said

22:52.705 --> 22:54.674
this sh--."
That never f---ing happened.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.409
You guys attacked her first.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.545
- You did nothing but
trash us on social media.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.480
- So did you! You did
the same thing to me!

23:00.513 --> 23:01.648
- No, you guys--
- Why is it okay for you...

23:01.681 --> 23:03.850
- It was the same bullsh--
- To do it and then not expect

23:03.883 --> 23:05.885
a retaliation from somebody?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.887
- But we've earned the right
to be assholes to each other.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.889
You didn't earn that right.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.891
- [chuckling]
Tom.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.860
- I want to go back to
the beginning of the season

23:13.893 --> 23:15.728
at that "OK! Magazine" party.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.597
Jax, we saw one of
your signature moves.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.631
Ripping off the coat.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.966
- Wait, Jax!
- Jax, Jax!

23:19.999 --> 23:22.735
- Jax, no!
- No, no, Jax, no!

23:22.769 --> 23:25.505
- I mean, there's only so much
you can take without, like,

23:25.538 --> 23:26.739
having to do something

23:26.773 --> 23:27.707
'cause there's a lot of
going back and forth

23:27.740 --> 23:29.876
of he said, she said,
and then there's, like,

23:29.909 --> 23:31.878
you know--
- Yet you stopped yourself.

23:31.911 --> 23:32.845
Why'd you stop yourself?

23:32.879 --> 23:33.980
- Well, I didn't stop myself.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.616
- Can Tom
answer that question?

23:36.649 --> 23:37.884
- No.
- I could hold Jax's back

23:37.917 --> 23:39.619
with one finger.
[laughter]

23:39.652 --> 23:41.621
He's not gonna do nothing.
- Well, I'm also on probation.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.490
At the time.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.992
- James, you accused Scheana
of having work done

23:46.025 --> 23:47.460
to her face.
- Right.

23:47.494 --> 23:48.628
- What did you think
she had done?

23:48.661 --> 23:50.863
- Uh, I said--
I said nose job at the time.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.632
- And--
- Um--

23:52.665 --> 23:54.634
- Which is funny because
I literally Snapchat my face

23:54.667 --> 23:56.469
every single day,
- Mm.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.471
- So I don't know when
I had the time to recover,

23:58.505 --> 23:59.739
and we've talked
about that since.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.807
- Yeah,
we talked about it since.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.675
Apologized again, and um,

24:02.709 --> 24:03.576
I apologized to you as well

24:03.610 --> 24:05.545
for saying that
you look pregnant as well,

24:05.578 --> 24:07.680
and I apologized to Schwartz
for saying that to your fiancé.

24:07.714 --> 24:08.781
- He did.
- Um...

24:08.815 --> 24:10.483
Yeah, it was wrong to say.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.918
I was definitely just trying
to get a dig in, you know?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.921
- Lala, what made you say,
"Obviously, some of us

24:14.954 --> 24:16.989
haven't been working on
our summer bodies"?

24:18.858 --> 24:19.626
- It just came out.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.060
I don't know
where it came from.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.562
[mumbles]
It just...

24:22.595 --> 24:23.830
- Good lord.
- I don't understand.

24:23.863 --> 24:24.964
- But you have to understand
that this is why

24:24.997 --> 24:25.965
we don't want to be
friends with you.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.700
- I don't wanna be frien--

24:27.734 --> 24:28.935
- Why would anybody want
to be friends with somebody

24:28.968 --> 24:30.703
who just called them fat?

24:30.737 --> 24:32.805
- Why is it okay for you
to say Kristen and Sta--

24:32.839 --> 24:34.841
Kristen and Scheana
are anorexic?

24:34.874 --> 24:36.543
That's a serious disease.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.910
- Yeah.
- That's body shaming.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.680
- My intent was to give them
a f---ing compliment.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.682
Are you kidding?

24:42.715 --> 24:43.916
- So you think
calling someone anorexic--

24:43.950 --> 24:45.518
- It was a jo--
- Is--

24:45.552 --> 24:46.686
- They got up from
the table and I said,

24:46.719 --> 24:47.854
"Let the anorexics go."

24:50.923 --> 24:52.625
- Yeah,
the anorexics can go off.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.726
- Kristen always--
- And I said, thank you.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.894
- Yeah, she said, thank you.

24:54.927 --> 24:55.862
- But I don't. I don't--
- My intent was--

24:55.895 --> 24:57.764
- I take offense to that.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.298
I did have a problem...
- Okay, Scheana, I had no idea.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.835
- With that in college.
I take it very seriously.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.303
- I had no idea that
that is something--

25:04.336 --> 25:05.705
- Well, it does.

25:05.738 --> 25:06.906
Have you not heard me
complaining about this

25:06.939 --> 25:08.575
for the last year?
- Yes, I actually--

25:08.608 --> 25:09.742
- And then you bitch at me,
"Stop complaining about

25:09.776 --> 25:11.711
being skinny," and I'm, like--
- 'Cause I could tell you

25:11.744 --> 25:13.713
how not to be skinny.
Go to Taco Bell or something.

25:13.746 --> 25:14.814
- That--I don't--
- Like, it's so easy.

25:14.847 --> 25:15.948
- I have a fast metabolism,
I'm sorry.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.717
- I know how to do it.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.785
- Schwartz, um...

25:18.818 --> 25:20.787
you seem to let James off...

25:20.820 --> 25:24.056
fairly easy for calling
your fiancée pregnant,

25:24.090 --> 25:25.692
but you went after Katie

25:25.725 --> 25:27.794
for questioning
Tom and Ariana's loyalty.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.562
- Well,
I was seething at James.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.697
I mean, I wanted to kill him.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.866
But then she started--
I feel like she got off track

25:33.900 --> 25:36.636
and she started getting upset
with Ariana and Tom

25:36.669 --> 25:37.737
for taking
James and Lala's side.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.838
They weren't, they were
just trying to figure out

25:38.871 --> 25:40.339
what exactly was happening.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.908
I think you guys were being--
- Well, I'm sorry,

25:41.941 --> 25:42.842
I was just still trying to
process that two people

25:42.875 --> 25:44.644
who don't know me--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.712
- Walked up and called me fat--
- Of course.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.746
- To my face.
- No, no.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.747
- Do you understand
how hurtful those words are?

25:47.780 --> 25:49.716
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, after I was provoked.

25:49.749 --> 25:50.950
- You don't think I know
what I look like?

25:50.983 --> 25:52.685
You don't think I know that
my clothes don't fit the same?

25:52.719 --> 25:53.953
You don't think I know
that I've gained weight?

25:53.986 --> 25:55.054
- I get made fun of for
the way I look like, too.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.589
Whatever.
- It's not up to you to come

25:56.623 --> 25:57.857
and throw that
in my f---ing face.

25:57.890 --> 25:58.825
- You see how much
it hurts, Katie?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.760
Do you see
how much it hurts?

26:00.793 --> 26:01.728
- Stop! I'm not talking to you.
- You take no responsibility

26:01.761 --> 26:03.896
for provoking this.
- I didn't provoke it.

26:03.930 --> 26:04.931
[overlapping comments]

26:04.964 --> 26:05.698
- Yeah, you did.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.133
- She did not
provoke it at all.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.635
- What the f---
are you talking about?

26:08.668 --> 26:09.902
- No, you have provoked
sh-- like this.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.003
This isn't the first time
this happened.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.905
It's an ongoing thing.
- Sandoval!

26:12.939 --> 26:13.906
- He's talking past tense.
- I did not provoke him.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.776
- I'm talking about,
it's been an ongoing thing.

26:16.809 --> 26:17.910
When you first met Lala,

26:17.944 --> 26:18.878
you were constantly
giving her sh--...

26:18.911 --> 26:20.647
- So were you!
- About every f---ing thing.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.915
- So were you!
- Not--no, I did initially.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.751
Right off the bat--
- Oh, oh, but not initially,

26:24.784 --> 26:25.852
but then you did,
but then you said--

26:25.885 --> 26:27.019
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, Katie.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.921
I was col--
I'm always protective

26:28.955 --> 26:30.657
of my friends
so I question anybody

26:30.690 --> 26:31.924
that first comes into our group.

26:31.958 --> 26:32.692
Okay?
That I did.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.794
Right?
But I'll tell you what,

26:34.827 --> 26:38.164
you went on a f---ing tangent
about Lala all last year.

26:38.197 --> 26:41.133
Don't act like you didn't.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.869
*

26:42.902 --> 26:44.871
- James, you were with Kristen
to get on the show?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.138
- Oh!

26:46.172 --> 26:47.774
- Oh, shut up, Stassi.

26:47.807 --> 26:48.908
Look at you.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.010
You came crawling back
from New York...

26:51.043 --> 26:53.012
please, please.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.718
[upbeat music]

26:58.751 --> 27:01.654
- Well, Lisa, I think
the unsung heroes of Sur

27:01.688 --> 27:04.056
are your chefs,
Christian and Guillermo.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.193
They're like our answer to
Statler and Waldorf

27:07.226 --> 27:08.661
from "The Muppets."
- Voice of reason.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.062
- Voice of reason.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.198
I know they have opinions
about all of you...

27:12.231 --> 27:14.066
so I raided the kitchen.

27:14.100 --> 27:17.269
[speaking Spanish]

27:17.303 --> 27:21.207
*

27:21.240 --> 27:22.308
- Si?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.213
- Katie?
- Katie.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.380
- Yeah.
- Ahh.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.217
- Beautiful?
[speaking Spanish]

27:31.250 --> 27:32.418
- She's a hot woman.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.420
- [speaking Spanish]

27:36.222 --> 27:37.189
- Oh, major--

27:37.223 --> 27:38.257
- Yeah.
- Yeah, si.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.230
- Crazy?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.177
- I love her.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.178
- You love her?
- Yeah.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.746
- Hair--
- Yeah.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.447
- She have a big boob.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.448
- Si.

28:36.482 --> 28:39.218
[all laughing]

28:39.251 --> 28:42.454
- What I want to know is
what was their opinion about me.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.323
- They love you.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.325
I want to switch gears
for a sec.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.327
James, are you still
dating Raquel exclusively?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.196
- Yeah, and I'm madly
in love with her, yes.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.297
- And you've been together
for how long?

28:51.330 --> 28:52.431
- A year now.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.334
- James,
GG is a hostess at Sur...

28:55.367 --> 28:58.771
who started saying that
you had had sex with her...

28:58.805 --> 29:00.506
- Right.
- While you were dating Raquel.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.141
- I didn't hook up with you.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.142
Ever.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.244
- James, you are actually
a f---ing psychopath.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.246
- Did you sleep with GG?

29:07.279 --> 29:08.247
- No.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.849
- [coughs]
Bullsh--.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.517
- Thanks again, Kristen,
for your input.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.152
- You're welcome.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.154
- I've heard from someone
who was close to GG

29:15.187 --> 29:16.522
for a short period of time.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

29:16.555 --> 29:19.859
- That she said she would
fight or f--- anyone

29:19.892 --> 29:20.860
to get in this group.

29:20.893 --> 29:21.861
- She said it to me.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.395
- What?
- On camera.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.231
- That doesn't mean she didn't
have sex with him, though.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.866
- Yeah, right.
- You know what?

29:26.899 --> 29:29.836
I believed that she had slept
with him up until she said

29:29.869 --> 29:31.003
that same thing,

29:31.037 --> 29:33.372
"I'll f--- and become friends
with whoever I need to."

29:33.405 --> 29:35.274
- Who is this bitch?

29:35.307 --> 29:36.375
I need to go after her now.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.844
- I wouldn't even
waste your time.

29:37.877 --> 29:40.146
- James, Ellie told Scheana

29:40.179 --> 29:42.514
that she had slept with you
while you were dating Raquel.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.250
- I did, um...

29:44.283 --> 29:46.152
sleep with him in March.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.854
- James?

29:47.887 --> 29:48.855
- March.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.289
8:44 a.m.

29:50.322 --> 29:53.292
- Uh, and she showed
a dated picture...

29:53.325 --> 29:55.294
- Mm.
- With a date stamp on it.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.162
- The first thing he said

29:56.195 --> 29:58.230
was that she photoshopped
a timestamp.

29:58.264 --> 29:59.298
That was the first--
his first response.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.167
- No, no, it wasn't
the first thing I said, darling.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.368
I said that could've been a--

30:02.401 --> 30:03.870
Whatever.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.537
There's apps to change
a whole f---ing face nowadays.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.306
- Impossible.
- That's a whole lot of work.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.374
That is a lot of work.
- No, it ain't!

30:08.407 --> 30:09.976
No, it ain't!

30:10.009 --> 30:11.377
- Normally, if a girl
brings into the forefront

30:11.410 --> 30:13.279
and she says she's
slept with somebody--

30:13.312 --> 30:14.313
I mean,
what's her motivation?

30:14.346 --> 30:16.282
I believe that she has
slept with that person.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.850
- Girls say that
about celebrities.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.251
I'm not talking about myself.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.253
Girls say that about
celebrities all the time.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.388
[laughter]

30:22.421 --> 30:24.390
- Okay, so--
- All the time.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.391
Just to be clear.

30:25.424 --> 30:26.458
- James, come on.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.860
- No, I won't come on, Lisa.
- I have known Ellie

30:27.894 --> 30:29.261
a long time, pal.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.229
- Yeah, I used to sleep...
- Ten years.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.397
- With her. Yeah,
we've had relations before.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.531
- I think--
- Yes.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.866
- There you go.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.001
Me and Ellie used to--
- No, no.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.003
She's a very honest girl.
- Right?

30:37.036 --> 30:38.537
- I think something--
- Is she? Really?

30:38.570 --> 30:40.306
- Yeah.
Yeah, she is.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.876
- Does anyone here believe
that James did not sleep...

30:43.910 --> 30:47.914
with GG or Ellie?

30:49.281 --> 30:50.316
- Don't rush
to raise your hands.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.351
- We're not.
[laughter]

30:52.384 --> 30:54.453
- The thing is, I mean,
James is not the most popular,

30:54.486 --> 30:57.924
liked guy, so I don't know
why anyone would make up

30:57.957 --> 30:59.992
that they slept with him
if they really didn't?

31:00.026 --> 31:01.260
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying,

31:01.293 --> 31:02.995
I don't see why
she would make it up.

31:03.029 --> 31:06.532
- Let's have Doute conduct
an independent investigation.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.334
- Yes, I'm--
yeah, let's put Doute on it.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.936
Doute's MacGyver.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.270
- And at the end of the day,
I love Raquel more than

31:11.303 --> 31:12.538
anything in the f---ing world,

31:12.571 --> 31:14.273
and I could give a f--- less

31:14.306 --> 31:16.308
what any of you lot
sitting down think.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.544
- James, relax.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.679
- I've never been in a happier
relationship in my life,

31:20.712 --> 31:22.314
you know, it's so--
it's just--

31:22.348 --> 31:23.282
I-I've never--
- Happier than you and Kristen

31:23.315 --> 31:24.316
even?
- Oh, my God.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.651
How many times?
- God.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.386
- That was the most, like,
toxic, negative thing ever,

31:27.419 --> 31:29.221
but at the end of the day,
I don't want to go into that.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.389
I had my reasons.

31:30.422 --> 31:31.991
- It did get you on a show.
- I've never been happier.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.292
Yeah, f--- yeah,
it did, mate.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.393
- [chuckles]
It got him on a show.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.394
[laughter]

31:35.427 --> 31:36.528
- Drop the f---ing mic!

31:36.562 --> 31:38.264
- Listen, listen,
to be honest,

31:38.297 --> 31:39.665
I was getting on
the show regardless

31:39.698 --> 31:41.267
'cause I was either gonna
move in with him,

31:41.300 --> 31:42.668
or start banging
his ex-girlfriend.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.670
- We were getting ready
to move in together,

31:44.703 --> 31:46.405
and she started f---ing him.
- I didn't--

31:46.438 --> 31:48.007
- Another one of my friends!

31:48.040 --> 31:50.009
- For there's three guys
on this side of the room,

31:50.042 --> 31:50.943
and she's banged all of us.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.678
So, I mean...
and that just goes to show...

31:52.711 --> 31:54.680
- Am I the only guy that
hasn't had sex with Kristen?

31:54.713 --> 31:56.282
- Schwartz hasn't.
- No, Schwartz hasn't.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.416
- Okay.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.018
James, you--
you were with Kristen

31:59.051 --> 32:00.419
to get on the show?

32:00.452 --> 32:02.488
- I don't know.
- James, you're like GG!

32:02.521 --> 32:03.956
- Oh, shut up, Stassi.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.091
Look at you.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.493
You came crawling back
from New York...

32:07.526 --> 32:09.361
please, please!

32:09.395 --> 32:10.362
So stop it.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.364
[laughter]

32:12.398 --> 32:14.333
- Oh, I'll never come back!

32:14.366 --> 32:15.734
One year.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.469
- I'm sorry, you're funny.

32:17.503 --> 32:18.604
You're funny today.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.372
- I'm f---ing sweating here.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.374
I said I wasn't
going to drink it today.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.344
[all laughing]

32:25.377 --> 32:26.478
- Have you been drinking?

32:26.512 --> 32:27.479
- No!
- Okay.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.481
- Not yet. Not yet.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.483
How is Jax
my best friend today?

32:31.517 --> 32:34.486
[all laughing]

32:34.520 --> 32:35.621
*

32:35.654 --> 32:37.456
- Oh, my God.
- Like, f---.

32:37.489 --> 32:38.624
[laughter]

32:38.657 --> 32:40.359
- I think we're having
the best reunion

32:40.392 --> 32:42.394
I've ever had
in my life right now.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.395
Whoo!

32:43.429 --> 32:44.596
*

32:44.630 --> 32:47.399
- Ariana, can you give me
your Stassi impression again?

32:47.433 --> 32:49.101
- Seriously? Seriously?

32:49.135 --> 32:50.769
I would f---ing kill myself.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.571
*

32:56.542 --> 32:58.777
[upbeat music]

32:58.810 --> 33:01.680
- We are back with the gang
from "Vanderpump Rules."

33:01.713 --> 33:04.116
Lisa, you seem to have
a soft spot for Lala.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.717
- I do.
- What do you see in her?

33:05.751 --> 33:09.388
- Because I see she's got
this kind of hard exterior,

33:09.421 --> 33:11.390
and she puts on
this big gangster image,

33:11.423 --> 33:13.125
and that's
really not who she is.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.793
She was a great hostess

33:14.826 --> 33:16.795
in terms of
just her likeability

33:16.828 --> 33:19.398
on the front desk, and
how she made people feel.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.799
We've gotten a lot of
compliments about her.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.702
- You know that time that,
Lisa, you asked me

33:23.735 --> 33:26.272
to kind of get everybody
together in the back alley.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.407
I was hoping that
maybe that would be...

33:28.440 --> 33:30.542
a time when other people
would get to see that.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.411
And I thought it was
a good idea to get everything

33:32.444 --> 33:33.479
out in the open.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.548
There are some things
that have been going around.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.517
You know,
all the married man rumors.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.420
- And this was my theory,
like, from the get-go with you.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.688
I just don't--
I don't trust you.

33:42.721 --> 33:47.193
- Well, yeah, I was trying to
cover up dating the guy I have

33:47.226 --> 33:49.228
because I just didn't
want to talk about it.

33:49.261 --> 33:53.232
- I'm dropping anything
I've been talking about you so

33:53.265 --> 33:55.234
I will apologize for
anything I've said about you

33:55.267 --> 33:56.535
that was untrue.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.837
- Did you really think
you owed her an apology?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.740
- If I was spreading a rumor
about things that weren't true,

34:01.773 --> 34:02.808
I absolutely
felt sorry for that.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.843
- That was a crock of sh--
because you did think

34:04.876 --> 34:06.445
they were true so
you weren't really sorry.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.314
- If what I said was true,
then--

34:08.347 --> 34:10.316
- Well, after that, you go,
"but I'm not really sorry

34:10.349 --> 34:11.750
'cause I know it's true."
- Yeah, because I'm getting

34:11.783 --> 34:13.319
so much sh-- for you guys
for saying sorry.

34:13.352 --> 34:14.753
- No.
- Yeah.

34:14.786 --> 34:15.754
- Stassi, if you had a--
- No, Scheana.

34:15.787 --> 34:16.755
Come on, own your sh--.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.956
Own your sh--.

34:17.989 --> 34:19.591
- If what I said was true...
- You thought it was true--

34:19.625 --> 34:20.592
then I'm not sorry for
talking about the truth.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.561
- So don't blame it on
Katie, Stassi, and I.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.263
- I'm just saying,
I said sorry--

34:24.296 --> 34:25.831
- Own your sh--
just like we own ours.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.134
- Okay, Katie,
when Scheana apologized,

34:28.167 --> 34:29.468
you were there.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.769
In the moment.
- Yeah, and I was, like,

34:30.802 --> 34:31.503
what the hell is going on?

34:31.537 --> 34:33.872
- Well,
you seemed kind of okay,

34:33.905 --> 34:36.875
but once Stassi
showed she was upset,

34:36.908 --> 34:39.245
you started
rage texting Scheana.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.247
Do you see how
people could think

34:41.280 --> 34:43.115
that you sometimes
follow Stassi's lead?

34:43.149 --> 34:45.384
- I could see how people
could think that sometimes,

34:45.417 --> 34:47.886
but I'm responsible
for my actions, not her.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.621
- Stassi, you were really...

34:49.655 --> 34:52.791
incensed by
Scheana's apology.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.360
Why?
- Yeah, I was.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.228
Because prior to that,

34:56.262 --> 34:59.265
everything that we had spoken
about was the opposite,

34:59.298 --> 35:00.632
and then it's like, the second--
- I changed my mind.

35:00.666 --> 35:02.634
- The heat gets on her,

35:02.668 --> 35:05.804
then she all of a sudden cowers.

35:05.837 --> 35:06.838
And that happens all--
- I don't do that.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.440
I do not do that.
Are you kidding?

35:08.474 --> 35:09.708
- Cowers? It's called
being a forgiving human being.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.510
Do you know anything about that?
- It's not--whoa, whoa, wait.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.512
- I was afraid of you guys
being f---ing mean to me.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.913
If I'm nice to her--
- No, you weren't.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.248
[overlapping comments]

35:16.282 --> 35:17.816
- If I'm nice--
let me speak.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.619
If I'm nice to Lala,
you would not be my friend.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.388
both: That is bullsh--!

35:22.421 --> 35:23.855
- Katie, you literally said

35:23.889 --> 35:25.324
anybody who's friends
with her is dead to me.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.428
- Are you gonna do that
to everybody here?

35:29.461 --> 35:31.263
You're gonna try
to recruit everyone?

35:31.297 --> 35:33.265
- Scheana, you'd flip-flop
with who you're--

35:33.299 --> 35:34.833
- You turn on a dime sometimes.
- You do.

35:34.866 --> 35:35.601
- I get along
with everyone, I do.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.935
- And that's
a wonderful quality

35:36.968 --> 35:38.404
to try and get along
with everyone--

35:38.437 --> 35:40.372
- But it doesn't work
for you guys if I get along

35:40.406 --> 35:41.607
with someone you don't like.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.674
- Number one,
stop saying you guys--

35:42.708 --> 35:43.675
- That's what it seems like it.

35:43.709 --> 35:44.610
That is what it seems like.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.412
- Thank you.
- That's exactly what it is.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.679
- When we have
conversations with Scheana,

35:47.713 --> 35:48.680
we try to be honest
about our feelings,

35:48.714 --> 35:50.549
and maybe if there's
something that upsets me,

35:50.582 --> 35:52.684
she turns it around and
makes herself into the victim

35:52.718 --> 35:54.920
so then I'm apologizing when
I was just trying to tell her

35:54.953 --> 35:56.288
that she had said--
- That is not true, Katie.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.224
- Your guys' go-to is
I victimize myself--

35:58.257 --> 36:00.492
- And your go-to is to say
that we're some bullies.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.860
- Because you have been!

36:01.893 --> 36:02.961
- No, we have not.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.963
- Katie, you went
and told Stassi that

36:04.996 --> 36:08.567
basically Scheana was,
like, kissing Lala's ass,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.869
apologizing profusely, like,

36:10.902 --> 36:14.873
all these exaggerations
of what actually was said

36:14.906 --> 36:15.874
instead of checking
with Scheana--

36:15.907 --> 36:17.142
- Yeah, you saw everything.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.109
- What happened on her side--
- You never apologize profusely.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.679
- You just literally
took it upon yourself

36:20.712 --> 36:21.547
to have an opinion.
- Once again,

36:21.580 --> 36:22.981
you were not there.
- We were there,

36:23.014 --> 36:24.450
and we tried--
- And I was there, too.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.984
- No, I know, I'm talking
about with Stassi.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.719
Stassi talked to you, and then

36:27.753 --> 36:29.988
we actually tried to have
a conversation with Stassi

36:30.021 --> 36:31.590
about what happened,

36:31.623 --> 36:33.325
and to tell your side
of the story,

36:33.359 --> 36:35.561
and you literally just, like,
flipped the f--- out.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.663
- 'Cause I was hammered AF.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.498
- Lala isn't somebody
that has ever been--

36:39.531 --> 36:40.732
- You won't even
let anybody finish--

36:40.766 --> 36:42.000
you won't even let us
finish this sentence.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.635
- Okay, I'm gonna be quiet and
I'm gonna let everybody talk.

36:43.669 --> 36:46.438
- So emotional, Stassi,
you're so emotional.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.639
And I don't know how
to have a conversation

36:47.673 --> 36:49.275
with someone
that's so emotional.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.376
- Then don't have
a conversation with me,

36:50.409 --> 36:51.643
and I'll just,
like, walk off.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.245
- Well, I mean, like,
can't we just talk about it,

36:53.279 --> 36:54.380
like, normally?

36:54.413 --> 36:56.615
Why are you just
getting so heated?

36:56.648 --> 36:58.684
- Scheana and Ariana
suck, Katie.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.454
I sat there trying to
defend you and they suck.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.723
- Ariana, can you give me
your Stassi impression again?

37:04.756 --> 37:07.025
- Seriously? Seriously?

37:07.058 --> 37:09.495
I would f---ing kill myself.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.630
- Scheana, were you nervous
going into the pool party

37:11.663 --> 37:13.732
knowing Katie and Stassi
were so mad?

37:13.765 --> 37:15.634
- Yeah, and I mean...

37:15.667 --> 37:17.636
I'm not saying this to be
a bitch, it's just the truth.

37:17.669 --> 37:18.770
They make me nervous.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.039
- You guys, honestly,
I get nervous around you, too.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.441
Like, I'm like, what--
- Me, too.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.042
- What wrong little thing
is gonna get said

37:24.075 --> 37:27.579
that is literally gonna, like,
start an eruption of, like,

37:27.613 --> 37:28.747
chaos for the rest of the night.
- I know that Scheana feels

37:28.780 --> 37:31.517
that way,
but everyone else, like...

37:31.550 --> 37:33.051
no one talks or sees you...

37:33.084 --> 37:34.753
- Yeah, I know, but from
an outside perspective,

37:34.786 --> 37:36.655
I feel like Stassi's...

37:36.688 --> 37:38.390
- I am so nice to you all!
- All of your bosses.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.526
Stassi's your boss, Kristen.
- Come on!

37:40.559 --> 37:42.328
- Do you feel like
Stassi's the boss?

37:42.361 --> 37:43.662
- Yeah, I feel like,
Stassi, you're the boss.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.331
You're--she's your boss.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.498
- That's a tired narrative.
- She's your boss.

37:46.532 --> 37:47.699
You're your own gal.
- That is so old.

37:47.733 --> 37:48.900
- No, Brittany doesn't care.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.303
She's nice to everybody because
she's her own f---ing woman.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.638
It used to be you two.
- No, that's not true,

37:52.671 --> 37:54.373
that's not true.
- Yeah, she's the head bitch

37:54.406 --> 37:55.607
in charge.
That's what she thinks.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.443
- The problem is that
this whole summer,

37:57.476 --> 37:59.645
Katie was
emotionally vulnerable.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.046
She was under a lot of stress.

38:01.079 --> 38:03.482
And instead of, like,
being her voice of reason,

38:03.515 --> 38:06.352
you guys enabled this, like,
negative behavior that she had.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.753
Hundred percent.
- I'm so sorry that

38:07.786 --> 38:11.022
I didn't handle every situation
that Katie had properly.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.558
- Stassi, at the party,

38:12.591 --> 38:14.993
you told Scheana
to stand up for something.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.463
- Like, in your zone--
- Stand up for something!

38:17.496 --> 38:18.530
Stand up for something.
- I am.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.699
I'm standing up for myself
saying that I'm done.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.100
- You're supposed to be
our best friend.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.702
What are you even saying?

38:23.735 --> 38:26.805
I thought we had the same
opinions on something--

38:26.838 --> 38:28.707
- Why do you have to
have the same opinions?

38:28.740 --> 38:29.608
- We don't have to.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.343
It's not about the fact
that we have to.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.711
It's the fact that
all of a sudden...

38:32.744 --> 38:33.712
- But it's just easier...
- She's just acting like

38:33.745 --> 38:35.447
somebody different.
- If I feel the same way

38:35.481 --> 38:36.515
you guys feel, it's just--
- No, it's not!

38:36.548 --> 38:37.683
all:
It's not about that.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.684
- Did you see that?
Did you just see that?

38:38.717 --> 38:42.421
F---ing hell, I'm in
the twilight zone right now.

38:42.454 --> 38:45.424
- It's just the three of them
all said the same thing at once.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.660
- We do it all the time because
you guys do this all the time.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.696
- [chuckling]

38:50.729 --> 38:51.663
- We'll be back in a minute.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.399
*

38:53.432 --> 38:54.666
- I'm upset about this because

38:54.700 --> 38:57.035
you guys have been
very f---ed up to her,

38:57.068 --> 38:58.770
and everybody has seen it.

38:58.804 --> 39:01.507
I've seen it firsthand.

39:05.143 --> 39:07.879
[upbeat music]

39:07.913 --> 39:10.148
- You know, Brittany,
you have remained Switzerland

39:10.181 --> 39:11.450
in this whole organization--

39:11.483 --> 39:12.884
- Yeah, and that's okay,
but I can't be.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.153
- And I'm curious,
what's your view on

39:15.186 --> 39:19.891
the idea that Scheana can't
go against this group.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.027
- Well, Scheana's my closest
friend that I have here.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.030
Me and her have been super close
ever since I moved here

39:25.063 --> 39:26.465
so it's just--

39:26.498 --> 39:28.967
she has confided in me
in so much,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.969
and there was times whenever
I know that she really did feel

39:31.002 --> 39:32.438
like she was being bullied on.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.440
- Stop being a bitch!
- No, no, no--

39:34.473 --> 39:36.041
- Stop being an asshole!
- No, Stassi,

39:36.074 --> 39:37.142
I'm done gossiping about her!

39:37.175 --> 39:38.510
I'm done talking about her.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.045
- The only reason
I'm angry about Lala

39:40.078 --> 39:42.581
is because of
your f---ing mouth.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.450
- It's just really hard for me.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.584
- I'm upset about this because

39:45.617 --> 39:48.454
you guys have been
very f---ed up to her.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.588
And everybody has seen it.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.423
I've seen it firsthand.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.458
Okay? Stop.
- Come on, you're--

39:52.491 --> 39:54.960
- I would like to know
why it's so hard for you

39:54.993 --> 39:59.097
if this is your friend
and she says, "This hurt me,"

39:59.130 --> 40:00.432
why is it so hard
for you to be, like,

40:00.466 --> 40:03.101
"Girl, we're friends, I'm sorry
that I made you feel that way."

40:03.134 --> 40:04.836
Even if you don't agree.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.105
Not once have I seen any of
you guys back down and be, like,

40:07.138 --> 40:08.440
that's my friend.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.141
- Lala, like, I understand.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.878
I mishandled my feelings
and emotions back then, 100%.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.914
I mismanaged my feelings
a lot this summer.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.149
But when you came and apologized
to me about calling me fat

40:18.183 --> 40:19.284
or whatever,
and the other things,

40:19.317 --> 40:21.887
I was not emotionally prepared
to accept an apology.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.489
I was still, like,
those words were hurtful.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.491
- But you still
threw down at me.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.792
You go,
well, you are a whore.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.060
Like, do you realize
how mean that is?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.161
- I'm trying to--
- Just let her finish.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.497
- I'm trying to apologize.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.164
- Okay, I would love that.

40:33.198 --> 40:37.035
- I don't like to sling insults
like calling people whores,

40:37.068 --> 40:38.504
and all of that.
That's--

40:38.537 --> 40:41.507
that was an ugly moment
for me to watch.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.175
I 100% apologize
for saying that.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.310
Because I was very stubborn
in the summer,

40:45.343 --> 40:47.513
especially towards you.
I have been for a long time

40:47.546 --> 40:49.180
because of things you said
about him because we have--

40:49.214 --> 40:50.516
we weren't in a good place.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.183
I wasn't in a good place
with myself,

40:52.217 --> 40:54.185
with my own body image,
and you didn't know that

40:54.219 --> 40:55.120
because we didn't
really have a friendship,

40:55.153 --> 40:58.857
we weren't close,
and so I went after you.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.258
You know? You're gonna
talk about my relationship,

41:00.291 --> 41:01.192
well, I'm gonna
talk about yours.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.261
I mean, that is
what I was doing, and I--

41:03.294 --> 41:05.263
that's not excusable.
That's not okay.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.265
I cannot justify
the things I said,

41:07.298 --> 41:10.168
but I do apologize for them.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.839
- It's okay, it's okay.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.206
- Don't want the lashes
to come off.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.842
- No need to--I--
- Go on.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.210
- Um...

41:19.244 --> 41:22.113
I've waited a long time
just to have...

41:22.147 --> 41:23.982
just one of them say...

41:24.015 --> 41:26.552
you know, like, I'm sorry
for hurting your feelings,

41:26.585 --> 41:28.253
and you have no idea.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.856
I--I did mean
that apology that day,

41:30.889 --> 41:33.224
and I totally get it,
you weren't ready to accept it,

41:33.258 --> 41:34.860
but...

41:34.893 --> 41:37.128
my mouth is vicious,

41:37.162 --> 41:39.130
and it's something
that I have to work on

41:39.164 --> 41:41.132
on a day-to-day because
when my feelings get hurt,

41:41.166 --> 41:43.268
it's like--
I will go for the jugular,

41:43.301 --> 41:44.903
and right after, I'm like--

41:44.936 --> 41:46.271
- We have that in common.

41:46.304 --> 41:47.873
- You guys are a lot more
alike than you realize.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.140
- I was just thinking that.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.009
- So that means
the world to me, and--

41:51.042 --> 41:55.981
I do not hate you
in any way of the word.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.248
- Well, there you go.
- Yeah, thank you.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.150
That's awesome.
- Yeah.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.152
- Okay, I feel like...

42:01.186 --> 42:03.622
we made a little headway here.
- Yeah.

42:03.655 --> 42:07.158
- Next week, it's Part Two of
the "Vanderpump Rules" Reunion.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.927
Why not make him happy

42:08.960 --> 42:10.929
by letting him give you
a big, fat ring?

42:10.962 --> 42:12.130
- I actually do, too.
- It's my life, and

42:12.163 --> 42:13.264
I will do what I want.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.733
- Don't hold back.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.267
- Well, you gotta let me talk.
- Oh, sorry.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.036
- You only think about...

42:18.069 --> 42:19.705
having sex with girls.

42:19.738 --> 42:21.607
[all laughing]

42:21.640 --> 42:24.275
- You're easy to manipulate.
- I'm speaking.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.011
How dare you?

42:26.044 --> 42:27.278
- Every single person in here

42:27.312 --> 42:29.014
has made a comment
about your drinking.

42:29.047 --> 42:31.282
- To insinuate that--
Scheana, that is really foul.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.619
- If everybody could just
not come up to me

42:33.652 --> 42:34.753
and start a fight with me,

42:34.786 --> 42:36.021
then maybe
I wouldn't have to tell you

42:36.054 --> 42:37.222
that I don't give a f---
about you.

42:37.255 --> 42:40.291
- You just think the worst of me
in every single situation.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.595
- You keep giving me
opportunities, Stassi.

42:43.629 --> 42:45.263
- I don't want to
beat around the bush.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.732
Were you dating
a married man?

42:46.765 --> 42:48.166
- I'm not answering
that question.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.035
- Because he's married?
- It's done.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.303
Do not f--- with
my relationship, bitch.

42:52.337 --> 42:54.305
