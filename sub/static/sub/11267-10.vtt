00:01.168 --> 00:02.419
Previously on:

00:02.461 --> 00:04.254
I found this awesome
rehab facility.

00:04.296 --> 00:06.173
We just need to come up with
$10,000 for the deposit,

00:06.214 --> 00:09.301
and we can tell everyone
that you were on tour

00:09.343 --> 00:11.762
with some music person.
Where are you getting $10,000?

00:11.804 --> 00:14.890
I've been having a lot of
financial problems lately.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.140
Would $5,000 help?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.685
ANNIE:
Ten would be better.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.227
RAJ: The treatment worked.
There's no sign of cancer.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.437
Ivy, I'm gonna live.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.439
Oh, my God...
This year's winner

00:22.481 --> 00:24.232
of the grand prize and
trip to New Guinea...

00:24.274 --> 00:25.192
Ivy Sullivan.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.652
I applied to Johns Hopkins.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.028
Oh, God, I don't know,
that's just,

00:28.069 --> 00:28.988
like, really, really far away.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.906
Yeah, well, so is New Guinea.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.741
Are we a couple, or did you
have sex with me in Vegas

00:32.783 --> 00:34.284
just to keep me away
from drugs?
I like you.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.870
But Annie asked
me to stay away.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.579
I'm sick of you trying
to control my life!

00:37.621 --> 00:38.706
I want to help you!

00:38.747 --> 00:39.999
A is the most important person

00:40.040 --> 00:41.583
in my life right now, not you.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.383
Oh, has it ever
been this hot?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.676
I saw a news report
this morning--

00:50.718 --> 00:52.887
someone roasted a turkey
in the trunk of their car.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.222
I can't wait to get home,
take off my clothes--

00:55.263 --> 00:57.265
not just because of
the weather.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.602
Hm, Austin's finally
coming home from Vegas.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.437
He was supposed to spend
the weekend with his mom and dad

01:02.479 --> 01:03.605
and have Thanksgiving there,

01:03.647 --> 01:05.691
but, apparently,
he can't stand

01:05.733 --> 01:07.860
to spend one more
minute without me.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.195
Sounds like at least
one of us has a date

01:10.237 --> 01:11.906
for Liam's random
Thanksgiving extravaganza.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.157
What is up with Liam
having a dinner party?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.743
Oh, my God--

01:15.784 --> 01:19.204
you don't think the turkey
in the trunk was him?

01:19.246 --> 01:22.082
He just said that he wants
to bring people together.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.333
Like, maybe, you and Navid.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.752
That's not happening.

01:24.793 --> 01:28.047
I have zero interest in getting
back together with Navid.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.840
He could just go spend
Thanksgiving

01:29.882 --> 01:31.258
with his
screwed-up family.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.594
Navid and I are done.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.678
Which is why you said "Navid"

01:34.720 --> 01:35.888
a hundred times
in the same sentence?

01:35.930 --> 01:38.057
I'm not hiding anything
about my love life.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.850
Annie's the one that
has the secret boyfriend.

01:39.892 --> 01:40.976
I do not.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.477
I broke up with Patrick.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.645
Okay, who exactly are you

01:43.687 --> 01:45.188
sneaking out
late at night with, then?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.858
Please tell me you're having
rebound sex with random people.

01:47.900 --> 01:48.943
I'd be very proud.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.361
I am not having sex
with strange men.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.530
I am doing charity work.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.115
Well, it usually is.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.911
I am talking about being busy
with activities in school, okay?

01:58.953 --> 02:00.454
And now I have to pick up Dixon

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
and not go have
a secret rendezvous.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.959
Huh. Protest much?
(scoffs)

02:08.795 --> 02:10.464
Excuse me...

02:10.505 --> 02:13.216
Are there any more fliers
for the food drive?

02:13.258 --> 02:14.885
Um...

02:14.927 --> 02:16.762
sorry, I guess my friend
took the last one.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.013
That's okay.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.264
I think I can remember that

02:19.306 --> 02:20.766
the student union Thanksgiving
food drive

02:20.808 --> 02:22.225
is in the student union.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.393
On Thanksgiving.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.812
You know, I should
write that down.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.647
(laughing):
Yeah...

02:28.523 --> 02:31.026
Well, uh, maybe we'll see
each other there.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.527
Yeah.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.988
Excuse me.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.074
Mm-mm!

02:37.116 --> 02:39.118
If I wasn't about to
have four solid days

02:39.159 --> 02:40.494
of makeup sex
with my boyfriend,

02:40.535 --> 02:42.287
I'd do a little charity.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.747
(sighs)

02:43.789 --> 02:44.873
You're such a giver.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.084
Mm.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.628
♪ ♪

02:50.754 --> 02:52.422
Annie! There you are!

02:52.464 --> 02:53.590
Dude, do you have a sec?

02:53.632 --> 02:54.758
What's up?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.802
Uh, nothing big,
just a couple girls kind of

02:56.844 --> 03:00.055
got arrested last night for...
(quietly): prostitution.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.723
What?!
How is that possible?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.224
You told me that escorting
was legal.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.601
Yeah, totally!

03:04.643 --> 03:07.228
So long as you don't have sex
and then take money for it.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.939
So you're totally cool.
Probably.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.482
Look, the cops are asking
a bunch of questions,

03:10.524 --> 03:11.775
and there's
a small chance

03:11.817 --> 03:13.234
that they might try to,
you know,

03:13.276 --> 03:14.862
talk to you and your friends,
blah, blah, blah.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.364
Look-- they can't do
anything without evidence.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.491
What kind of evidence?
Eh, you know, uh,

03:19.533 --> 03:20.575
catching you in the act,

03:20.617 --> 03:21.743
unexplained cash flow,
stuff like that.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.453
I don't want you to get
spooked, okay, Annie?

03:23.495 --> 03:27.124
Because you have
nothing to hide.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.959
Mm-hmm.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.461
Okay, call me
if you need me.

03:36.967 --> 03:41.805
Aw... you brought me back
a clay thing.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.058
It-It-It's... it's a vase.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.810
Oh.
Yeah.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.021
It's part of my
hands-on therapy.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.647
It looked a lot
better in my head.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.107
But, anyway, it's
just to say sorry

03:52.149 --> 03:53.525
for everything that
I said before I left.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.694
Dixon, you do not
need to apologize.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.945
Yes, I do.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.864
Another part of rehab
is making amends,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.448
so I know you were just

04:00.490 --> 04:01.575
looking out for me

04:01.616 --> 04:03.493
and keeping my best
interests at heart.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.204
I was out of line
and I'm sorry.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.454
I love you.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.789
I love you, too.

04:07.831 --> 04:11.710
And I'm really glad that you're
doing so great in rehab

04:11.752 --> 04:13.587
that they let you out
for a visit.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.672
It really makes all that
we're doing worthwhile.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.800
Speaking of which,

04:18.841 --> 04:20.468
I have your next payment.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.137
It's due when
you get back.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.514
Are you gonna tell me where
you're getting all this money?

04:24.556 --> 04:25.974
(door opens)

04:26.016 --> 04:28.018
Hey, look who
rode into town.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.979
What's up, guys?

04:31.021 --> 04:33.690
Aren't you supposed to be doing
Thanksgiving with your parents?

04:33.732 --> 04:35.316
I was, but Mom couldn't make it

04:35.358 --> 04:39.947
and Dad's back-up plan
was tacos and tequila, so...

04:39.988 --> 04:42.074
So, your back-up plan is Liam's
Thanksgiving dinner?

04:42.116 --> 04:43.867
Because I'm
expecting hot dogs and beer.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.493
At best.
Wait a minute--

04:45.535 --> 04:47.328
you guys aren't spending
Thanksgiving with your folks?

04:47.370 --> 04:48.329
ANNIE:
Our parents split up.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.790
Mom and her boyfriend
are in Paris,

04:49.831 --> 04:52.584
and Dad and his girlfriend
are at some weirdo

04:52.626 --> 04:54.253
tree-hugger retreat
in the desert.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.421
Yeah, well, divorce sucks, huh?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.839
But, hey...

04:57.881 --> 04:59.216
at least
you got the weekend off

04:59.258 --> 05:00.092
from your big music tour.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.051
How's it going, superstar?

05:01.093 --> 05:04.387
Oh! Uh, th-the music tour.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.014
Um...
Yeah.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.143
I'm actually...
Really, really tired.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.103
Right?

05:11.145 --> 05:13.272
I mean, Dixon, you played,
what, like ten shows

05:13.354 --> 05:14.773
in two weeks
or something, right?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.816
No way.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.067
Yeah, yeah,
something like that.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.902
(phone chimes)

05:18.944 --> 05:20.737
And, uh... (chuckles)

05:20.779 --> 05:24.032
Naomi's looking for me,
so see you guys.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.660
Okay, now, um...

05:26.701 --> 05:29.579
I know I said I wanted to keep
my drug problem a secret,

05:29.621 --> 05:31.165
but that was just weird.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.749
Another part of
rehab is being honest.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.169
Well, honesty is great,

05:35.210 --> 05:37.963
and, again,
I'm really glad that rehab

05:38.005 --> 05:39.256
is working so well for you.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.008
But, I mean,
I covered for you

05:41.049 --> 05:42.550
when you didn't want
everyone knowing

05:42.592 --> 05:44.343
about your drug problem,

05:44.385 --> 05:48.182
so maybe we just keep it in the
family until it's all over.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.391
Okay?
Fine.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.602
But when I come back from
"tour" with 50 lumpy ashtrays,

05:52.644 --> 05:54.271
you're going to have
some explaining to do.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.438
(Annie laughs)

05:58.692 --> 05:59.901
(sighs)

05:59.943 --> 06:02.654
IVY: Oh, my God, Raj,
New Guinea is going to be...

06:02.696 --> 06:04.363
amazing.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.657
Come on, you have
to come.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.034
We can just take
some extra time

06:07.075 --> 06:09.328
after my photo internship
and go, I don't know,

06:09.368 --> 06:11.663
backpack through Australia
or something-- look at this.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.831
RAJ:
Are you kidding me?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.333
Or check this out.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.377
Ocean City, Maryland.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.965
It's like the O.C.
of the East Coast.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.925
And it's only a three-hour drive
from Baltimore.

06:23.967 --> 06:28.055
Yeah, that definitely puts
the Great Barrier Reef to shame.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.182
Ivy, look, I can't go on this
photo internship with you, okay?

06:30.224 --> 06:32.059
I have to be
at Johns Hopkins next week

06:32.100 --> 06:33.352
for my entry interview.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.395
Then I have to complete my
undergrad degree this semester.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.356
Okay, I get it.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.606
You can't come with me.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.027
I'll just go
to New Guinea alone.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.362
Or with Nick-- whatever.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.322
Or...

06:45.364 --> 06:47.532
you can go to New Guinea
some other time

06:47.574 --> 06:50.035
and come to Baltimore with me.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.703
Raj, you're not
serious, are you?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.205
Come on,
that's ridiculous.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.622
I have worked so hard
for this.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.957
Yeah, and I'm working
really hard

06:55.999 --> 06:57.209
to get my life started again,

06:57.251 --> 06:59.044
but you don't mind asking me
to dump everything

06:59.086 --> 07:00.212
and go to New Guinea.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.046
Yeah, okay, I'm sorry.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.214
I just, I don't know,

07:02.256 --> 07:03.715
I thought you'd want
to be with me, that's all.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.093
I do. And we will.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.928
We'll just have to
work this out, okay?

07:07.969 --> 07:08.929
Together.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.431
Other couples do it, right?

07:11.472 --> 07:16.395
Planning a lifetime together
is a good problem to have.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.897
Okay?
Sure.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.367
Okay. Uh...

07:30.409 --> 07:32.702
I guess turkeys
can fly, huh?

07:32.744 --> 07:33.661
It's this heat again, man.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.122
My AC's busted.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.540
Yeah, I think it's an excuse
to take off your shirt

07:37.582 --> 07:39.251
during the big Thanksgiving
dinner, "Ab Man."

07:39.293 --> 07:40.877
Hey, don't mock the abs.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.171
I finally have money to do
things I never done before,

07:43.213 --> 07:45.924
like have a really nice
Thanksgiving.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.259
I'm doing
this thing right, man.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.427
Catered meal,
Naomi's mansion,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.762
maybe, uh, even a performance

07:50.804 --> 07:52.389
by a new musical artist
named you?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.766
Hmm?
Huh...

07:54.808 --> 07:56.684
Um...

07:56.726 --> 07:59.896
you know, the tour's been
taking a lot out of me, man.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.023
Seriously. Next time.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.442
That's fine.
Just leave me hanging.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.735
I'll just take some of my
modeling money and hire Jay-Z.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.113
Heard he's not above
taking a job.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.239
Jay-Z?

08:09.281 --> 08:10.865
You'd be better off using
that modeling money

08:10.907 --> 08:12.492
to get a centerpiece that's
not from kindergarten.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.244
Oh, man!

08:14.286 --> 08:15.787
I thought this was nice.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.207
No?
(groans)

08:19.249 --> 08:20.834
Fine.
I'll call a florist.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.586
'Cause nothing is
ruining this Thanksgiving.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.213
Nothing.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.970
When did Liam become so chatty?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.388
I thought he'd never leave.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.308
Dixon, stop.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.602
Okay, look, I was up the river
for quite a while.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.688
I need the lovin'
of a good woman. Come here.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.732
Rehab isn't prison, okay?

08:44.774 --> 08:46.360
And you're not finished yet.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.321
Okay, um, I thought you said
we shouldn't trust my feelings

08:49.363 --> 08:51.698
while I was using...
I mean, I'm clean now.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.074
No, that's good.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.369
It's just, it's time to start
the recovery process.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.870
You're the only person
that really knows

08:56.911 --> 08:57.620
what I'm going through.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.746
Like, I need you.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.249
No, what you need is to be
able to tell the truth,

09:01.291 --> 09:02.667
instead of this whole

09:02.709 --> 09:05.920
"Hey, I'm a musical artist
on break from tour."

09:07.755 --> 09:10.550
I'm sorry, Dixon...
you're still not ready.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.762
Adrianna...

09:17.724 --> 09:19.393
♪ ♪

09:19.434 --> 09:20.935
(door shuts)

09:20.977 --> 09:24.439
I know what you're going to be
thankful for this Thanksgiving.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.030
Hey, you sure you want
to spend Thanksgiving with me

09:32.072 --> 09:33.698
and not your family?

09:33.740 --> 09:34.908
Are you kidding?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.743
My dad cheated on my mom,
they got divorced,

09:36.784 --> 09:38.370
and I haven't spent a
holiday with them in years.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.705
Besides, we only have
about 12 hours

09:40.747 --> 09:42.749
before Liam rings
the dinner bell,

09:42.790 --> 09:46.503
so take off your jeans

09:46.545 --> 09:49.047
and show me how
much you missed me.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.550
Whoo!

09:51.591 --> 09:54.010
By the way,
you should be aware

09:54.052 --> 09:55.845
that this little
lingerie number

09:55.887 --> 09:58.139
was purchased
in anticipation of being

09:58.181 --> 10:01.226
ripped off... by you.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.192
You know, uh...

10:09.234 --> 10:11.027
this isn't all we can do.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.363
We can talk.
Like, I don't know, if it...

10:13.405 --> 10:15.282
if it bothers you that your
parents aren't together,

10:15.323 --> 10:16.533
you know?

10:16.575 --> 10:17.784
The only thing that bothers me

10:17.825 --> 10:19.286
is hearing
the word "parents" in bed.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.955
So what if they're
divorced, okay?

10:21.996 --> 10:22.956
They're old.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.291
We're young.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.375
And we're hot.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.709
We should enjoy this
while we can.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.669
Nothing lasts
forever, right?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.464
Except maybe...

10:30.505 --> 10:33.091
reunion sex.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.135
You want to find out?

10:36.511 --> 10:38.597
Um, you know, I'm sorry,
I'm just a little tired.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.681
You mind if
I take a rain check?

11:05.582 --> 11:06.541
Okay, well, I was supposed

11:06.583 --> 11:07.417
to go to the student union

11:07.459 --> 11:09.127
food drive, but apparently,
every hungry person

11:09.169 --> 11:10.378
on the planet
should come here.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.963
(chuckles)
(phone rings)

11:12.005 --> 11:14.633
Is that Patrick's ringtone?

11:14.673 --> 11:15.674
It used to be,

11:15.716 --> 11:17.594
but I use it
for a lot of people.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.347
I know it's tempting
to try to make it work,

11:20.388 --> 11:21.931
but there's better guys
out there.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.809
And I'm sure there are,
but you don't have

11:24.851 --> 11:28.229
to worry about it 'cause
I'm not seeing Patrick.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.939
How cool is this?!

11:29.981 --> 11:33.026
I bought the perfect
Thanksgiving dinner.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.903
ANNIE:
Ew.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.905
Why... why is it not brown?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.407
Uh, you gotta cook it first.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.868
See? Instructions.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.996
"Baste"?
What the hell is that?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.706
I wish I could help.
I gotta go to the food drive.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.544
And you know what they
say about too many cooks.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.884
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

11:57.925 --> 12:02.263
How tired does one have
to be to resist this?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.474
Uh, pretty tired?
Yeah.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.724
Try dead.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.602
Which is what Austin
is going to be

12:07.644 --> 12:09.020
if he does not explain to me

12:09.062 --> 12:10.855
why we didn't have sex
last night.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.399
Ivy, you're married.
How long it take

12:12.440 --> 12:13.941
your relationship
to kill your sex drive?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.528
Okay, not talking about
my sex life with you, babe.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.906
Okay, what exactly happened
before nothing happened?

12:19.947 --> 12:21.491
What happened?
Austin was talking,

12:21.533 --> 12:22.617
I was kissing him,

12:22.659 --> 12:24.494
I told him to hurry up
and jump me...

12:24.536 --> 12:26.287
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.872
Sex as a command performance?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.249
Not so romantic.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.710
Yeah. I mean, you were kind of
like being the dude about it.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.378
You know, guys like
to stay in charge.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.755
Well, I guess he does walk
around in that stupid cowboy hat

12:36.797 --> 12:38.757
like he's the big man
on the prairie.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.967
Yes, he does.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.469
Okay, fine,
I just have to find

12:41.511 --> 12:43.263
a way to make him feel all manly
and in charge.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.723
But he'd better sweep me
off my feet

12:44.763 --> 12:46.807
and onto my back before Liam's
done with that dinner.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.851
(utensils clatter)

12:48.893 --> 12:51.646
Well, I don't think
you'll have to worry about that.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.231
You got time.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.237
Okay, I gave you
the last flyer,

12:59.279 --> 13:01.114
but I will fight you
for that corn.

13:01.155 --> 13:04.576
Wow. A man who believes
in a well-balanced meal.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.785
I respect that.
You can have the corn.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.828
I'm Silver.

13:07.870 --> 13:08.996
Greg.
Hi.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.541
So, what brings you here,
when you could be

13:11.583 --> 13:12.959
parade-watching
and giblet-chopping?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.920
My friends are pretty distracted
with school

13:15.962 --> 13:17.880
and their own love lives.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.340
Since I'm taking a break
from both,

13:19.382 --> 13:21.760
I figured I'd try to help
the world. What about you?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.011
The Grapes of Wrath.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.096
Yeah, I teach

13:25.138 --> 13:27.056
a course in American Lit,

13:27.098 --> 13:28.057
and Steinbeck basically
guilted me into this.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.351
Damn him
and his compelling depictions

13:30.393 --> 13:31.728
of poverty and hunger.

13:31.770 --> 13:32.729
I know.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.690
Caring about people,
how lame, right?

13:35.732 --> 13:38.359
Besides, I didn't
have anything else to do.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.236
And I was told this was where

13:40.278 --> 13:42.196
the cool single people hang out
on Thanksgiving.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.156
Really?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.240
Yeah. It looks like

13:44.282 --> 13:45.366
I got some good information.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.576
You know,
if you've got

13:46.618 --> 13:48.328
no place to go go,
and you're interested in

13:48.369 --> 13:49.496
meeting someone,
my friends are having

13:49.537 --> 13:50.455
a dinner thing after this.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.290
I wouldn't be imposing?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.458
Not at all.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.084
I know one
really cool, single girl

13:55.126 --> 13:57.128
who would love
to have dinner with you.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.880
Mm. That sounds like a date.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.846
Where do you guys think Naomi
keeps her meat thermometer?

14:07.888 --> 14:08.931
Dude, seriously?

14:08.973 --> 14:10.057
Naomi lived here a month

14:10.099 --> 14:11.892
before I even realized
there was a kitchen.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.687
Whoa. That looks
like a 30-pound bird.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.647
Shouldn't it be
in the oven by now?

14:15.689 --> 14:18.399
Oven's heating.

14:18.441 --> 14:19.984
Why is the oven not heating?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.821
I think she uses that
to store extra shoes.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.614
(all chuckle)

14:24.656 --> 14:26.032
Okay, scheduling problem.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.785
I told my parents Ivy and I
would be over after dinner,

14:28.827 --> 14:30.787
which is now looking
more like midnight.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.206
Wait. Why are we going
to your parent's house?

14:33.247 --> 14:34.457
Because it's
Thanksgiving.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.709
It's a family holiday

14:35.750 --> 14:37.293
that you spend with your family.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.212
I get that, but did you just
make these plans

14:39.253 --> 14:40.421
and not even ask me

14:40.463 --> 14:41.756
and assume I was just gonna
go along with them?

14:41.798 --> 14:43.174
Well, would you rather
fly to Big Sur

14:43.216 --> 14:44.467
and spend the holiday
with your mother,

14:44.509 --> 14:46.553
fasting and having some weird

14:46.594 --> 14:49.305
Native American prayer ceremony?
I get it.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.140
Let's just...
Whatever. It's not a big deal.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.976
We'll go to your parents' and
bail out on Liam. Sorry, guys.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.562
RAJ:
Thank you.
Hey...

14:55.603 --> 14:57.271
Sorry, buddy.
I made place cards!

14:57.313 --> 14:58.648
Dude, just order pizza.
No!

14:58.690 --> 15:01.067
You took a break from your
concert tour to be here.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.861
I'm making sure you get
a home-cooked meal.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
Yeah, Dixon, look,

15:03.944 --> 15:05.446
Liam even ordered
the sweet potato casserole

15:05.488 --> 15:08.491
just like Mom used to cook.
Remember?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.201
Our first Thanksgiving
as a family,

15:10.243 --> 15:12.119
you practically ate
the entire thing.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.246
Best Thanksgiving ever.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.999
Yeah. Um, what
I remember is being

15:17.041 --> 15:18.668
eight years old
and trying to act

15:18.710 --> 15:20.587
like having a new family
wasn't terrifying.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.505
I guess that's

15:22.547 --> 15:23.548
a Thanksgiving tradition, too,

15:23.590 --> 15:24.883
pretending everything
is all cool.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.593
Can we stop talking
about lousy

15:26.634 --> 15:29.178
family Thanksgivings
and just try to save this one?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.263
Hmm.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.273
Are you okay?

15:40.314 --> 15:42.942
Fantastic. Why?

15:42.983 --> 15:45.194
I've just never
done this before.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.946
I wanted everything
to be perfect.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.116
More perfect than Thanksgiving
with your family?

15:54.161 --> 15:56.748
Holidays were the worst,
you know? When I was little,

15:56.790 --> 15:59.083
we were broke,
my mom had to work.

15:59.125 --> 16:03.003
It'd just be me sitting there
home alone with a TV dinner.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.590
Then she married my stepdad,

16:05.632 --> 16:06.925
thinking that would
change everything.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.719
Have you ever tried
calling her?

16:09.761 --> 16:11.471
(scoffs) No.
She made her choice.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.973
Anyway, I just figured
now that I have money,

16:14.014 --> 16:16.810
I could at least fix
a proper Thanksgiving dinner.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.812
I guess I can't even have that.

16:18.853 --> 16:23.441
Liam, you have a lot more
than money.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.235
And you do have this.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.279
(chuckles)

16:28.321 --> 16:30.072
400 degrees, five hours.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.784
Everything
is gonna be perfect.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.249
NAOMI:
Thank you for teaching
me how to ride.

16:40.291 --> 16:44.003
It's so scary
being up on this
big animal like this.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.422
Let the horse know
who's boss, you'll be fine.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.841
Okay.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.258
(horse nickers)

16:49.300 --> 16:50.760
Oh! Oh, my God!

16:50.802 --> 16:52.219
What is he doing, Austin?!

16:52.261 --> 16:54.931
What is he doing?! Oh, my God!

16:54.973 --> 16:56.265
What is he doing?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.142
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh!

16:58.184 --> 17:01.312
Okay, okay.
(panting)

17:01.354 --> 17:02.480
(laughs)

17:02.522 --> 17:05.316
Whew! Oh, my God.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.526
Oh! (panting)

17:06.567 --> 17:08.653
You saved my life.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.571
Yeah, good thing I stopped you.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.825
You almost rode a horse.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.785
What the hell's going on?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.453
What are you talking about?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.954
Pretending you don't know
how to ride.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.040
Come on. Your reins were up,
your heels were down.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.002
Hell, you ride better than I do.
Your lying needs work, but...

17:24.042 --> 17:28.756
Okay, fine, I've been taking
lessons since I was four.

17:28.798 --> 17:32.259
I was trying to make you
feel better about yourself.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.012
You thought acting like an idiot
would make me feel better

17:34.053 --> 17:34.971
about myself?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.597
No, I thought sex would,
but apparently

17:36.639 --> 17:38.391
you have issues
with strong women!

17:38.432 --> 17:40.434
If by "strong woman,"
you mean pain in the ass,

17:40.476 --> 17:42.937
then yeah, I got an issue.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.104
Hey, maybe, maybe

17:44.146 --> 17:46.106
nothing happened last night
because I want something more.

17:46.148 --> 17:46.733
Oh, yeah?

17:46.774 --> 17:50.987
Well, maybe I should find
someone who wants me!

17:51.029 --> 17:53.907
Be my guest, darling.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.909
(horse neighs)

17:55.950 --> 17:57.535
Austin! Austin,

17:57.577 --> 18:01.372
don't ride away from me,
you... cowpie!

18:06.335 --> 18:07.921
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:07.962 --> 18:09.756
Oh... Oh, my God.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.090
Oh, my God. Okay.

18:11.131 --> 18:14.010
Are you kidding me?!

18:14.052 --> 18:16.054
Austin, my leg... Austin...

18:16.095 --> 18:17.555
I don't need you!

18:17.597 --> 18:19.515
I'll do it myself!

18:32.278 --> 18:34.321
Help me!

18:38.534 --> 18:39.285
I thought you'd want

18:39.326 --> 18:40.494
to go to my parents' house.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.495
When we got married,

18:41.537 --> 18:42.496
you were so excited

18:42.538 --> 18:43.748
that I had this big family.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.832
You know what, Raj?
All of a sudden

18:44.874 --> 18:46.125
it's become all about you
and your family.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.419
It's your family, too.
You're my wife!
Okay, don't pull

18:48.461 --> 18:49.462
that "wife" crap on me.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.170
That does not give you the right

18:50.212 --> 18:51.589
to just start
calling the shots.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.799
It's just dinner!

18:52.840 --> 18:54.592
How does that mean I'm
calling all the shots?

18:54.634 --> 18:56.343
You know what? Because it's not
just dinner, Raj!

18:56.385 --> 18:57.678
I'm not talking about dinner
here, okay?!

18:57.720 --> 18:59.889
It's talking about our lives
together.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.181
I did not marry you to have

19:01.223 --> 19:02.600
to choose between my dreams
and yours.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.684
I did not marry you

19:03.726 --> 19:05.311
to spend six years of my life
in Baltimore!

19:05.352 --> 19:07.563
Then why did you marry me, Ivy?!

19:16.196 --> 19:17.865
I guess neither of us thought

19:17.907 --> 19:20.910
"forever" was gonna
be that long.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.328
(sniffles) Raj...

19:22.369 --> 19:23.704
No, I-I get it.

19:23.746 --> 19:27.291
We got married
because I was dying.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.210
But I've got my life back,

19:30.252 --> 19:31.921
and I'm not gonna give it up.

19:31.963 --> 19:35.758
I'm going to medical school,
Ivy.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.261
I'm going to my parents' house.

19:39.303 --> 19:43.808
And if you don't want
to go with me, then...

19:43.850 --> 19:48.146
maybe us getting married
was a mistake.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.696
(sobbing softly)

19:59.615 --> 20:00.867
Oh, there she is!

20:00.908 --> 20:02.160
Annie, this is Greg.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.703
We met at the food drive.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.246
Annie is my friend that
I was talking about.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.666
She's very cool and very
single. Right, Annie?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.376
Yeah, I guess I am.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.544
Nice to meet you.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.586
Yeah, you, too.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.631
It's funny. When Silver said
she had a friend

20:15.673 --> 20:19.093
she wanted me to meet, I had
no idea that you would be...

20:19.135 --> 20:20.386
so real.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.972
Greg is an American Lit
teacher at C.U.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.892
He is also a published poet
and a journalism major

20:25.933 --> 20:27.143
who loves New York.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.394
Kind of perfect, right?

20:28.435 --> 20:30.521
Hmm. For who?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.066
You know what?

20:33.107 --> 20:34.901
This should be
put in the fridge.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.027
Uh, the kitchen?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.737
Yeah, back there.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.654
Mm-hmm.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.989
He's kind of cute, right?

20:40.031 --> 20:42.366
I mean, I know he's a teacher
and you're a student,

20:42.408 --> 20:43.576
but you're not, like,
his student,

20:43.617 --> 20:45.244
Yeah, so not what I need
right now.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.913
I'm sorry. Look, I hope
I'm not overstepping.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.873
It's just, with this whole
Patrick thing,

20:48.915 --> 20:50.416
I don't know-- I just...
you deserve

20:50.457 --> 20:52.376
to be with someone
who's really nice.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.794
Well, so do you.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.796
Which is probably what
Greg was thinking

20:55.838 --> 20:57.131
when you invited him to dinner.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.175
He's clearly
here for you.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.551
What?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.136
Maybe you could
actually see that

21:02.178 --> 21:04.847
if you were really over Navid.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.898
(grunting)

21:16.483 --> 21:18.611
(horse neighs)

21:18.652 --> 21:20.613
Oh, thank God, water.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.322
Come here, horsie.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.282
Come here, baby.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.784
What's your name?
What's your name?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.702
Um, uh, Bessie, Tressie...

21:26.744 --> 21:28.246
Come here, Chessie.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.205
No, Jessie, Jessie,

21:29.247 --> 21:30.873
Come here, Jessie.
Come on, Jessie.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.084
Come on. Come on.

21:33.126 --> 21:36.045
Come on. Okay.
Oh, that's right.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.296
Oh, that's right.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.840
(yelling anxiously)

21:39.882 --> 21:42.760
Come back! Come back, Jessie!

21:42.802 --> 21:45.846
Please don't leave me!

21:45.888 --> 21:50.017
Who's gonna chew off my foot
when I start hallucinating

21:50.059 --> 21:52.645
like that guy
in the really long movie?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.105
Oh, man.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.198
Would you like anything
with that?

22:05.199 --> 22:07.285
Maybe a wall to punch?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.869
Are all you women crazy,
or just Naomi?

22:08.911 --> 22:10.621
No good answer to that.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.291
I think I already know, so...

22:14.834 --> 22:17.336
Look, I know I'm just
a waitress, not a bartender,

22:17.377 --> 22:20.380
but if you want to talk...
I'm good with drinking.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.050
Okay.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.724
Trail map.

22:30.766 --> 22:32.268
All right.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.560
Granola bar.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.981
Really nice, Austin.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.399
I should call his father.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.526
Oh, yes!

22:40.567 --> 22:43.029
Oh, yes! Mm...!

22:43.070 --> 22:43.988
Okay...

22:44.030 --> 22:46.032
There's got to be service.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.283
Come on...

22:47.325 --> 22:49.076
Come on. Come on!

22:49.118 --> 22:51.162
Damn it.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.915
Oh...

22:55.875 --> 22:57.793
Oh, I'm going to die here.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.087
All right, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

23:00.129 --> 23:03.132
Oh, my God. Okay, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.800
The key to survival
is to stay calm.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.844
The key to survival is to...

23:06.886 --> 23:08.679
stay calm.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.388
Yes, yes.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.389
Oh.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.100
Thank you.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.186
Mm. Okay. Okay.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.855
Uh-huh.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.360
(cawing)
Oh!

23:27.114 --> 23:28.532
Actually, I'm teaching
literature at CU this year

23:28.574 --> 23:30.368
while I work on getting
a second Master's in film.

23:30.408 --> 23:31.702
Oh, film, huh?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.704
Well, you should talk
to our friend Silver.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.998
(chuckles)
Yeah, I've been
trying to.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.291
(doorbell rings)
Oh, I'll get it.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.459
Ah. Must be the delivery guy
with the centerpiece.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.254
Yes, that's right:
Liam Court, male model,

23:41.295 --> 23:42.420
ordered a centerpiece.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.840
Uh...

23:44.882 --> 23:47.134
I-It's not the centerpiece.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.474
Mom?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.813
Wha...?

24:04.193 --> 24:06.695
COLLEEN (whispering):
I am so sorry to surprise you.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.114
I heard from one
of the neighbors

24:08.155 --> 24:09.156
that you bought a bar,
so I stopped by,

24:09.198 --> 24:10.657
and your waitress
said you were here.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.118
I haven't seen you
in over a year,

24:12.159 --> 24:15.121
and you show up out of the blue?
What do you want?

24:15.162 --> 24:16.580
It's Thanksgiving.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.749
I just wanted to see
how my son is doing.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.793
I made it clear that
it was Jeffrey or me.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.211
And you made your choice.
I know.

24:22.253 --> 24:25.005
And there's another reason
that I wanted to see you.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.340
Liam, I'm...

24:26.382 --> 24:28.675
I'm not with Jeffrey anymore.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.387
It's over.

24:31.429 --> 24:31.971
Really?

24:32.012 --> 24:34.514
Losing you was the worst
mistake that I ever made.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.142
I never should've
chosen him over you.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.768
Maybe it just took being

24:37.810 --> 24:40.980
out of your life for so long
for me to realize that.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.940
Oh, God... I don't want to
ruin your Thanksgiving.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.234
I'm gonna go.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.903
Mom, wait.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.410
I ordered a lot of extra food,
so if you want to stay,

24:54.452 --> 24:55.661
you should.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.875
TV SPORTSCASTER:
...and he still tucks it up,
finds Hemingway,

25:01.917 --> 25:04.544
who is G-O-N-N gone!

25:05.921 --> 25:07.881
Hey. So, uh, Raj isn't
going to make it.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.342
You should sit
next to your date.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.593
Oh, Greg's not...
I mean...

25:11.635 --> 25:13.304
We just met...

25:15.139 --> 25:16.514
You okay?

25:16.556 --> 25:18.767
Not really.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.686
Raj and I just had
some huge fight about

25:20.727 --> 25:25.107
where to spend Thanksgiving
slash the rest of our lives.

25:25.149 --> 25:26.566
Hey, divorced at eighteen,

25:26.608 --> 25:28.194
I could probably get
my own reality show.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.736
Not divorced.
It's just a fight.

25:29.778 --> 25:30.946
Really?

25:30.988 --> 25:33.366
Just like you and Navid?

25:33.407 --> 25:35.617
(sighs)
Sorry.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.995
He just came out
and said it, you know?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.372
It was so weird. He just said,

25:39.413 --> 25:41.915
maybe we shouldn't
be married anymore.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.210
Ivy, I'm sorry.
I just can't help but wonder

25:44.251 --> 25:47.421
if maybe he's actually right
about it.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.547
I mean, what if he is?
I mean, what if...

25:49.589 --> 25:52.051
what if him and I never actually
thought any of this through?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.260
But you guys
love each other.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.595
You have been through
so much together.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.848
Yeah, but... Silver,
this wasn't exactly

25:57.890 --> 25:59.475
supposed to last forever.

25:59.517 --> 26:02.520
I know that sounds horrible,
but you know what I mean.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.230
I mean, of course I love him--

26:04.271 --> 26:06.648
you know I-I love him--

26:06.690 --> 26:08.734
But how many people do you know
who meet the guy

26:08.775 --> 26:10.903
they're supposed to spend
the rest of their life with

26:10.944 --> 26:12.946
while they're in high school?

26:12.988 --> 26:15.199
Maybe he is right.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.243
Maybe we're supposed
to let this thing go,

26:17.284 --> 26:19.745
and just-- I don't know--

26:19.786 --> 26:22.122
see what we both
want out of life.

26:22.164 --> 26:24.333
There we go, man.
Yeah.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.884
Yeah, maybe.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.593
(cell phone rings)

26:35.635 --> 26:37.763
Oh! Here.
Oh.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.517
Hi. I can't really talk
right now.

26:41.559 --> 26:44.978
Oh. I'm so sorry, I must have
grabbed the wrong phone.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.106
Oh, Colleen is...

26:48.606 --> 26:50.776
in the kitchen.
I can grab her.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.861
Sure.

26:52.903 --> 26:55.864
I'll, uh... be sure to
give her the message.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.074
Okay.

26:57.116 --> 27:00.578
Liam, the turkey
smells wonderful.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.121
I had no idea
you could cook.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.373
Well, yeah... you just
gotta remember to baste.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.083
I can't believe how
much you've grown up.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.043
And what a success,
with the bar,

27:08.085 --> 27:10.129
and those billboards
everywhere...
(groans)

27:10.170 --> 27:11.629
That's... that's
kind of embarrassing.

27:11.671 --> 27:12.590
Not for a mom.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.133
(laughing)
That's...

27:14.174 --> 27:16.176
Hey. Uh...

27:16.218 --> 27:19.096
Liam. Sorry. Uh, can I
speak to you for a second?

27:19.138 --> 27:20.264
Yeah, sure.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.099
Oh, speaking of pictures,
I want to see if

27:22.141 --> 27:23.476
one of your friends
has a camera,

27:23.517 --> 27:26.686
because I would love
a picture of us together.
Yeah.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.192
Okay, uh... Here.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.611
What's this?

27:33.651 --> 27:35.070
Your mom's cell phone.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.323
I answered it by mistake.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.532
It was Jeffrey.

27:39.866 --> 27:40.826
What a jerk.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.702
Can't leave her alone
for Thanksgiving.

27:42.744 --> 27:46.748
He wanted to know when she was
going to be home for dinner.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.546
She told me she left him.

27:52.588 --> 27:55.341
I'm so sorry.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.426
(doorbell rings)

28:06.226 --> 28:09.522
Oh, my God. Uh...
Can I help you?

28:09.563 --> 28:11.649
Yeah. There's been a brush fire
sighted in the hills nearby.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.860
I'm afraid we're going to
have to ask you to evacuate.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.323
The Parks Department spotted
smoke up near one of the trails,

28:19.365 --> 28:20.991
and because of the heat
and the wind,

28:21.033 --> 28:22.868
the risk of a brush fire
is pretty serious,

28:22.909 --> 28:25.078
so we're just having everybody
leave the area as a precaution.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.080
So let's just grab the food
and head down to the bar.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.875
No, no. Evacuation means you
need to vacate immediately.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.751
Unless it's an essential
item, just leave it behind.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.297
We've spent Thanksgiving at
worse places than the beach.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.798
I know.
See you there, sweetheart.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.595
Hey, Ivy, where are you going?

28:41.637 --> 28:43.889
Um, I just gotta grab one thing.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.349
But I'll catch up with you guys.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.476
Okay.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.647
I think I'm just
going to head home.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.815
Annie's great; it's just,
I thought that we were...

28:56.360 --> 28:59.655
All right. I guess I can
stay and talk for a minute.

28:59.697 --> 29:02.575
I'm sorry, I couldn't
let you walk away.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.743
I just got out of
a serious relationship.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.286
You know? And I didn't feel like

29:06.328 --> 29:09.707
I was ready to meet anyone else.
But... I like you.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.751
And I think I liked you
from the moment that we met.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.628
I guess I could have
said all that before,

29:14.670 --> 29:15.921
but the kiss just seemed easier.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.465
Yeah, well, kissing works.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.759
So how about I call you
and we have a nice,

29:20.800 --> 29:24.221
disaster- and holiday-free
first date, huh?

29:24.263 --> 29:26.139
Yeah, I'd like that.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.146
Last call for
a sympathetic ear.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.692
You really like her,
don't you?

29:36.734 --> 29:37.901
What does it matter?

29:37.943 --> 29:41.988
Like the lady said,
nothing lasts forever, right?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.074
Not unless you try.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.535
Look, I know Naomi
is a lot of work,

29:46.577 --> 29:49.788
but if two people really like
each other, then it's worth it.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.124
Then why aren't you
and Dix together?

29:52.165 --> 29:53.584
Oh, don't pretend
like there's nothing

29:53.626 --> 29:55.669
going on between you two.
I live with the guy.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.463
He practically carves "I
heart Adrianna" in his toast.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.673
Dixon doesn't know what he
really wants right now.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.134
Sounds like a cop-out.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.970
Trust me, I've used
every excuse in the book.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.346
"It's not you, it's me...

30:06.388 --> 30:07.806
"the timing isn't right...

30:07.847 --> 30:10.058
I met someone else."

30:10.100 --> 30:11.851
I could get my heart broken.

30:11.893 --> 30:15.314
Again. And that's not
an excuse, that's real.

30:16.774 --> 30:18.275
Dixon's going
through something.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.069
He's scared and he wants me
to be there for him.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.905
But if he can't be
honest about it...

30:23.947 --> 30:25.824
I mean, sometimes you have
to trust people enough

30:25.865 --> 30:27.242
to tell them the truth.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.581
(laughing, chatting)

30:32.623 --> 30:35.542
Hi. What happened
to the big dinner party?

30:35.584 --> 30:36.960
Oh, we got evacuated.

30:37.002 --> 30:40.005
Some lunatic started
a brush fire near Naomi's house.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.382
Where is Naomi?
I thought she was with you.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.470
Uh... Hey, Liam, I need
to borrow your bike.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.846
Just... yeah.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.682
COLLEEN:
Well, it's not
going to be fancy,

30:49.723 --> 30:52.810
but I bet we can whip up
something to be thankful for.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.528
This is such a great
location for a restaurant.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.737
And with your face everywhere,

31:03.779 --> 31:05.614
you know, it's like you
have free advertising.

31:05.656 --> 31:08.826
Not that you need my advice
on how to make money.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.537
Is that my phone?
Jeffrey called.

31:11.578 --> 31:15.040
Liam, I can...
You didn't leave him.

31:15.081 --> 31:18.460
I want to.
I'm going to.
You told me you had.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.295
Why would you lie to me?
Because I didn't
think that you would

31:20.337 --> 31:23.590
let me back in your life
if I was still with him.
Well, you're right.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.050
So why are you with him?

31:25.091 --> 31:27.720
Because I can't leave
him without... help.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.179
So you need a place to stay,

31:29.221 --> 31:30.972
I will help you find
an apartment...

31:31.931 --> 31:33.851
I mean financial help.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.690
So that's why you wanted
to be back in my life?

31:39.732 --> 31:42.735
You looked up and you saw my
face on a bunch of billboards,

31:42.776 --> 31:44.069
and you assumed I had money.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.696
Well, so what's the plan?

31:45.738 --> 31:47.406
You just gonna live
off me instead of,

31:47.447 --> 31:49.908
instead of him, now?
I wouldn't put it like that.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.326
There's no other way to put it.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.995
What else am I supposed to do,
go back to cleaning houses?

31:54.037 --> 31:55.372
At my age? There's...

31:55.414 --> 31:57.499
It's all right. Leave Jeffrey.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.335
I'll write you a check.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.713
You can have
whatever you want...

32:02.755 --> 32:04.590
except me.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.675
Oh, Liam...

32:08.594 --> 32:10.679
(laughs)

32:12.598 --> 32:14.140
Where's, uh...
where's Ivy?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.434
Is she okay?

32:15.475 --> 32:17.519
Yeah. She-she went to get
something out of the house.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.438
But she called from
the car, so she's cool.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.482
When I heard about the fire,
I practically ran here, man.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.526
If something had
happened to Ivy...
You'd be with her.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.279
See, man? That-that's,
that's love.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.614
One person going
through something,

32:28.655 --> 32:31.199
and the other person being there
for them, no matter what.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.410
Like when you had cancer,
Ivy was there for you.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.955
That wasn't love, man.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.082
That was me being
a selfish jerk.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.543
What?
What I felt right now
when I was afraid for Ivy?

32:41.585 --> 32:44.463
She's been feeling that way
for me every day for a year.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.256
I married her
without thinking about

32:46.298 --> 32:48.967
what that would do to her life,
what she would be giving up.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.845
I didn't think about her at all.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.972
I was just scared to be alone.

32:56.391 --> 33:00.103
Um, okay, so-so, uh, maybe
you were a little selfish,

33:00.145 --> 33:01.855
but, dude,
cut yourself some slack.

33:01.897 --> 33:02.981
You were dying.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.274
I'm better now.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.402
And I have to start thinking
about what she needs.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.998
Happy Thanksgiving dinner.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.750
No double dipping.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.836
Hey, at least
we're all together, right?

33:23.877 --> 33:25.754
Yay.
(laughing)

33:25.796 --> 33:28.173
DIXON:
Ade, wait.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.675
Please.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.139
Uh, guys, uh,
I have something

33:36.181 --> 33:38.725
I got to say.

33:38.767 --> 33:42.103
Um, okay, um, as we know,
the holidays are about

33:42.145 --> 33:44.189
being with family.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.693
So, you guys are my family.

33:47.734 --> 33:51.029
So, I have to be
honest with you.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.577
The truth is...

33:59.705 --> 34:02.708
I'm a drug addict.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.501
(sighs)

34:14.761 --> 34:17.723
Happy Thanksgiving.

34:21.935 --> 34:25.813
To Annie Wilson,
I leave my entire wardrobe.

34:25.856 --> 34:29.818
My shoes, my dresses,
my designer bags--

34:29.860 --> 34:31.737
on one condition.

34:31.777 --> 34:34.614
Kill Austin Tallridge!

34:34.656 --> 34:36.491
(engine revving)

34:38.744 --> 34:39.995
Help! Help!

34:41.871 --> 34:43.456
Hi.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.418
Help.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.087
I'm trapped here.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.547
Can you help?

34:50.589 --> 34:53.466
Oh, it's you.

34:53.507 --> 34:56.511
Happy to see you, too.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.388
Had to bypass two roadblocks
to get up here.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.473
So drop the attitude
and tell me what happened.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.600
I am stuck,

35:01.641 --> 35:03.226
you idiot.
That's what happened.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.520
And it's all your fault, because
of your-your male pride

35:05.562 --> 35:08.398
and your weak cell phone signal
and your illicit narcotics

35:08.440 --> 35:10.650
And your pigheadedness had
nothing to do with it?

35:10.692 --> 35:12.402
You know what, I don't
need you to save me.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.737
Okay, I'm sure there's
a truck full of firemen

35:13.779 --> 35:15.989
on the way up here right now
who would love to do the job.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.407
You don't get to be rescued
by a fireman!

35:17.449 --> 35:18.658
You're getting to be rescued
by me.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.869
Well, then stop talking
and start rescuing!
We never started talking!

35:20.911 --> 35:23.288
We never talk.
Okay, that's the problem.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.707
If you want to talk, talk!

35:25.749 --> 35:28.043
My parents are getting divorced.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.840
My mom met someone else.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.009
That's why she wasn't in Vegas.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.179
No matter what
you think about my dad,

35:40.221 --> 35:41.723
he loved her.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.601
And she just
walked away.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.396
So you were right-- nothing
really does last forever.

35:48.438 --> 35:51.691
You really are an idiot, Austin,
you know that?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.777
What else do I have to do

35:53.819 --> 35:57.238
to prove to you
that I want to be with you?

35:57.280 --> 36:02.368
I've crossed state lines. I have
streamed an Internet confession

36:02.410 --> 36:07.499
to every college student
in the entire country.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.835
Austin, would you listen to me?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.100
I'm right here.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.395
And I'm not going anywhere.

36:32.732 --> 36:37.821
And not just because
my foot is stuck.

36:37.863 --> 36:41.199
Well, are you going
to rescue me or not?

36:48.123 --> 36:50.042
You ready?

36:50.083 --> 36:51.793
Come on, pull your
little foot out, okay?

36:51.835 --> 36:53.170
(grunts)

36:53.211 --> 36:55.338
Come on, pull!
Oh! Oh!

36:55.380 --> 36:57.841
(laughing)

36:57.883 --> 36:59.634
(gasping)

36:59.676 --> 37:00.802
Oh!

37:00.844 --> 37:02.054
Come on.
Oh!

37:02.095 --> 37:04.389
(grunting)

37:04.430 --> 37:06.558
That was kind of sexy
being rescued.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.894
You still got that
lingerie at home?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.854
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.537
To family holidays.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.956
They suck.

37:32.375 --> 37:35.336
So, what happened
with your mom?

37:35.378 --> 37:37.422
I told her I'd rather
spend Thanksgiving

37:37.463 --> 37:38.798
with my real family.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.716
Mm.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.718
I'm sorry.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.720
I mean it.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.305
I've got a lot
to be thankful for.

37:46.347 --> 37:51.061
I've got this place.
I've got friends.

37:51.103 --> 37:56.441
I always used to feel like
I didn't have anyone, you know.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.026
Then seeing Dixon

37:58.068 --> 38:01.238
telling us about what he's
been through, I realized

38:01.279 --> 38:03.865
that guy's like
a brother to me.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.491
I'd do anything for him.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.912
Yep. Me, too.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.249
Man, I just can't believe
he didn't think he could
tell us the truth.

38:12.290 --> 38:16.461
I mean, if you can't
rely on your friends,
who can you rely on?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.973
(coughs)
Holy moley.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.016
Looks a little dry.
Yeah.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.726
At least the pie's still good.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.312
(laughter)

38:34.353 --> 38:36.106
Oh, you guys are back.

38:36.148 --> 38:39.358
Uh, hey, if you're looking
for whipped cream for that,

38:39.400 --> 38:40.819
we're out.

38:40.860 --> 38:44.030
Yep.
(laughing)
(phone ringing)

38:45.031 --> 38:46.658
Hey, Dr. Woodford.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.119
Happy Thanksgiving.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.204
(clearing throat)
Annie.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.915
Mm. So...

38:53.957 --> 38:56.542
Dixon's rehab sounds expensive.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.086
Yeah, but I got it covered.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.297
Really, don't worry about it.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.090
Okay, I'm just going
to come out and say it.

39:02.132 --> 39:03.925
You didn't break up
with Patrick, did you?

39:03.967 --> 39:06.385
I mean, come on.

39:06.427 --> 39:08.680
The secrets and the ringtone

39:08.721 --> 39:10.974
and coming up
with that kind of cash?

39:11.016 --> 39:12.475
He cheated on you.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.644
I mean, you can't stay with
a guy because he's got money.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.438
It's just wrong.
I know.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.982
And I'm not.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.109
So where's the money
coming from?

39:22.527 --> 39:23.903
Annie, I'm your friend.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.530
You can tell me anything.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.244
I got the inheritance.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.537
What?!

39:32.578 --> 39:35.332
Yeah, Marla's inheritance.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.750
And my lawyer told me not
to say anything to anybody,

39:37.792 --> 39:39.460
but it came through.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.629
So, you really don't have
to worry about me.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.589
Everything is under control.

39:43.631 --> 39:44.799
Yay.

39:50.013 --> 39:53.099
I don't understand.
The blood tests were good.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.185
They said I was cured.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.978
The rise
in your blood cell count

39:57.020 --> 39:59.147
appears to have been temporary.

39:59.189 --> 40:00.565
Unfortunately,
the preliminary tests

40:00.606 --> 40:02.192
don't always show
the whole picture.

40:02.234 --> 40:06.112
Your treatment didn't work, Raj.
I'm sorry.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.282
I'm glad you're here.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.992
Ivy...
No, listen,

40:11.034 --> 40:14.079
I have something to say,
and I know how I feel

40:14.120 --> 40:16.164
and what I want,
and this is it, Raj.

40:16.206 --> 40:18.541
All right here
in our wedding album.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.959
I couldn't leave
the house without it.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.212
It was like I was losing you
or something.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.922
And that is not
something that I want.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.799
Sure, it was a mistake not
thinking about the future,

40:26.841 --> 40:30.220
but that doesn't mean that it
was a mistake being with you

40:30.262 --> 40:31.346
or loving you, and...

40:31.388 --> 40:33.681
and I married you
because I wanted to spend

40:33.723 --> 40:35.641
the rest of your life with you,

40:35.683 --> 40:38.353
and I still do.

40:49.989 --> 40:52.450
But I don't.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.663
What?

40:57.705 --> 41:01.042
Ivy, we were only together
because of my cancer.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.668
And it's gone.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.963
So I think that
me and you

41:05.004 --> 41:07.382
need to live our own lives.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.888
I'm sorry.
