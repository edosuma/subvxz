01:24.041 --> 01:25.458
Morning, Philbs.

01:40.875 --> 01:43.248
This is David Cork.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.164
He works for Endobank,

01:45.166 --> 01:48.500
a once successful bank,
now in decline.

01:49.708 --> 01:53.373
David Cork is a data
processing assistant, level 2.

01:53.375 --> 01:56.039
But actually, he's an artist.

01:56.041 --> 01:58.123
A comic book artist.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.831
- It's manga.
- Ah.

01:59.833 --> 02:03.206
- So tell me, David Cork...
- Uh, yes?

02:03.208 --> 02:04.831
..who's the hero?

02:04.833 --> 02:08.830
Foxy Chaos, seventh
daughter of the Storm Nebula.

02:08.833 --> 02:11.083
Spreading love throughout
the second universe.

02:12.916 --> 02:15.039
And who's the bad guy?

02:15.041 --> 02:16.708
You've got to have a bad guy.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.164
Senior Customer
Relations Officer.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.581
- And you live in New York?
- Yeah. It's beautiful.

02:25.583 --> 02:28.998
- And you?
- Endobank, Australia.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.998
Guy Curry,
head of Business Banking.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.039
- Your CEO spoke earlier.
- Yes, Clive Struthers.

02:35.041 --> 02:38.498
Impressive.
Perhaps a little conservative.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.414
We should be doing
twice the business.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.873
Our data processing centres
are inefficient.

02:42.875 --> 02:44.581
We need to be far
more aggressive.

02:44.583 --> 02:46.539
- You mean reckless.
- I mean ruthless.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.623
There's a difference?

02:48.625 --> 02:51.498
I can show you later,
if you like.

02:51.500 --> 02:54.956
- I don't think so.
- Your loss.

02:54.958 --> 02:56.875
I think I'll say hello
to Clive.

03:02.958 --> 03:06.291
Every Tsar falls one day,
Mr. Curry.

03:07.291 --> 03:08.583
Excuse me?

03:10.083 --> 03:11.500
Max Menkoff.

03:13.208 --> 03:14.625
I can help you.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.289
Business is revolution.
Revolution is business.

03:20.291 --> 03:23.498
Menkoff Management System's
revolutionary system

03:23.500 --> 03:25.581
can deliver increased
productivity

03:25.583 --> 03:27.414
and efficiency gain
for your bank.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.039
- Mm-hm.
- Total commitment.

03:29.041 --> 03:30.831
Total engagement. All staff.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.498
Look, this is all very well

03:32.500 --> 03:34.164
but I don't have
the authority.

03:34.166 --> 03:38.039
Don't you want success?
I can offer you success.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.164
Performance-enhancing regime

03:40.166 --> 03:42.623
with minimal adverse
side effects.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.623
- Clive would never agree.
- Clive is not important.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.914
If only that were true.

03:47.916 --> 03:50.583
I can get rid of Clive.
It's part of Menkoff Method.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.123
First, PowerPoint.
Then we talk.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.289
One moment.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.748
Room service!

03:58.750 --> 04:02.166
Da, da, da. Da, da.
Here, please. Please.

04:06.541 --> 04:07.708
Aargh!

04:21.166 --> 04:22.750
Catch!

04:41.625 --> 04:42.998
Business rival.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.414
Well,
that's not strictly correct.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.539
Max Menkoff is an evil genius

04:47.541 --> 04:50.206
who stole money and
deadly Polonium 210

04:50.208 --> 04:51.956
from the United
Mongolian Bank.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.581
And they want it back.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.456
Look, I just came for
a presentation...

04:55.458 --> 04:57.125
Sidet!

05:04.000 --> 05:07.875
Please. I have PowerPoint. Hmm?

05:10.083 --> 05:12.998

no profit.

05:21.666 --> 05:25.373
After, 360 million rubles

05:39.708 --> 05:41.998
Alice, make sure that includes
CMEs this time.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.623
Yes, Phil.

05:43.625 --> 05:47.873
David. You fixed the database yet?

05:47.875 --> 05:49.333
Uh...

05:50.375 --> 05:53.248
Okay, no, you haven't.
I already checked.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.708
- Got an ETA?
- Thursday.

05:56.666 --> 06:00.041
- Thursday?
- Thursday morning.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.041
Or... today?

06:04.833 --> 06:06.833
- Uh...
- Make it 11.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.666
After 10, before 12.
Get a thesaurus.

06:12.875 --> 06:16.041
Template database printout
on my desk - 11, okay?

06:17.541 --> 06:19.125
Can't be done.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.498
You'll need Mynix.
You'll need Mynix.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.248
Mynix is down.
I'm working on it.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.289
But yeah...

06:28.291 --> 06:30.373
...Sorry about that.

06:30.375 --> 06:33.748
Gary Barrett. IT.
Short-term contract.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.500
Just get it done.

06:36.541 --> 06:41.289
When you can. And stop doing
whatever it is you're doing.

06:41.291 --> 06:43.333
Or you'll be talking
to Marjorie.

06:49.208 --> 06:53.081
I use Mynix every day.
There's nothing wrong with it.

06:53.083 --> 06:57.498
Is now. Can be for
as long as you want.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.208
Us against them, mate.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.914
Hot chick. Smoke?

07:04.916 --> 07:07.956
Uh, no, thanks.

07:07.958 --> 07:11.039
- No, no, I-I don't smoke.
- That's a bit antisocial.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.789
I'm not a very social person.

07:12.791 --> 07:15.041
You don't need
to smoke to take a break.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.581
Marjorie doesn't allow breaks.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.456
Yeah, I'm sure she doesn't
allow cartoons either.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.748
- It's manga.
- Of course it is.

07:23.750 --> 07:27.000
It's huge in Japan.
I'm entering a contest there.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.875
'Foxy Chaos'.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.123
Oh, hey, Dave.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.956
Um, I just brought in
some biscuits

07:34.958 --> 07:37.456
and thought maybe you would
like some biscuits too.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.458
So I've got some for you here.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.500
Would you like some? Biscuits?

07:43.708 --> 07:45.208
Sure. Thanks.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.831
- I don't mind comics.
- Hey.

07:51.833 --> 07:55.956
- Morning, Mr. Curry.
- Morning... Ruby.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.956
Did you two have a good trip?

07:57.958 --> 07:59.706
I did. Great trip.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.456
I was hoping to include your
report for the board meeting.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.414
- I have Clive's.
- Of course you have.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.748
You know, it's not all about
pieces of paper.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.373
No! No, I understand.

08:09.375 --> 08:12.125
We need to move this bank
into the 21st century.

08:13.541 --> 08:15.041
And you can be part of that.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.916
I'll see you up there.

08:19.083 --> 08:20.706
Ruby. Good weekend?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.373
Yes, thank you, Mr. Struthers.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.875
- Harold.
- Clive.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.791
- Guy. Dubai went well?
- Certainly did.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.166
So what do you get if you win?

08:37.375 --> 08:39.998
Uh, they publish
the winning entry.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.291
And you get an internship with
Takuya Fujimoro.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.500
A samurai?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.583
No, the creator of Foxy Chaos.

08:50.791 --> 08:55.125
- He's a master.
- Ah! Cool, man.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.166
Please don't get ash on that.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.164
Bet you you give good Excel,
though, don't ya?

09:03.166 --> 09:05.081
Hey? Shit-hot spreadsheets.

09:05.083 --> 09:07.706
I bet you it gets Phil nice
and hot under the collar, hey?

09:07.708 --> 09:08.831
Huh?

09:08.833 --> 09:10.958
What a shame, life isn't a comic book.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.041
I mean, what's it really
all about, Dave?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.875
Is it really just all about sex?

09:19.333 --> 09:22.248
You got a lady? Biscuit girl.
She seems keen.

09:22.250 --> 09:24.791
- Who?
- Ah, me neither.

09:25.541 --> 09:28.291
Too career-focused.
I'm a singer.

09:30.958 --> 09:33.500
'Gary Barrett and
the Instruments of Death.'

09:35.333 --> 09:36.831
You can keep that.

09:36.833 --> 09:39.833
- Hey, good luck.
- Thanks.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.208
Hey, Trev! How you goin'?

09:49.541 --> 09:51.041
Since you been fired.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.208
Help me, Takuya Fujimoro.

10:02.291 --> 10:03.791
You're my only hope.

10:05.166 --> 10:09.706
Get out of my cubicle!

10:09.708 --> 10:11.331
- Get out of my cubicle!
- Trev.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.873
- They made me move.
- Wait.

10:13.875 --> 10:17.789
- I liked my old cubicle.
- Get out!

10:17.791 --> 10:20.123
This cubicle was my life!

10:20.125 --> 10:22.123
Ah!

10:22.125 --> 10:23.750
Oh, shit! Fuck!

10:24.916 --> 10:26.041
Trev...

10:28.791 --> 10:30.083
Melting Moment?

10:54.583 --> 10:56.791
You'll be fine, Trevor.

11:36.875 --> 11:40.164
- Insider trading.
- They are just allegations.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.498
By whom?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.414
The evidence requires us
to investigate the matter.

11:44.416 --> 11:46.206
This is absurd.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.916
I'm sure they'll come
to nothing.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.291
Until that time...

11:51.458 --> 11:53.541
...I've no choice
but to stand down.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.500
I appreciate that.

11:57.708 --> 12:00.373
One piece of advice.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.748
Don't even think of making him
acting CEO.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.914
- I don't think it's app...
- He's not up to it.

12:04.916 --> 12:07.375
- Excuse me!
- You're not up to it.

12:11.666 --> 12:12.873
Sorry.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.539
Harold, you know me.

12:15.541 --> 12:17.581
I'm sure you can see
this is nonsense.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.291
Our hand is forced.

12:21.291 --> 12:23.458
For heaven's sake,
I told you I'd step down.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.375
The king is dead.

12:32.666 --> 12:35.083
- Long live the king.
- Na zdrowie!

12:38.875 --> 12:40.708
The pilot program
is all yours, Max.

12:41.125 --> 12:45.373
- And then, the full rollout.
- Thank you, Mr. Curry.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.206
We are very happy to be here.

12:47.208 --> 12:50.748
Our method is simple,
yet effective.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.789
Svetlana, Karpov are
experienced practitioners.

12:53.791 --> 12:56.998
I welcome you to my country.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.873
Your supplement program
is groundbreaking.

12:59.875 --> 13:01.791
It could make
all the difference.

13:03.666 --> 13:05.831
Please keep in secure location.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.248
Uh, yeah, what is it?

13:08.250 --> 13:11.664
Most of my recipients become
very good workers.

13:11.666 --> 13:15.206
Some - very few - have
negative reaction. Not many.

13:15.208 --> 13:18.039
Supplements make them
like zombies.

13:18.041 --> 13:21.914
This will reverse.
It is, how you say, antidote.

13:21.916 --> 13:25.414
- Uh, what?
- Please, keep safe.

13:25.416 --> 13:27.666
In wrong hands,
could destroy all our work.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.289
Okay.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.331
Pretty numbers, Max, pretty
numbers, I can sell anything.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.539
- Just make them pretty.
- Of course.

13:37.541 --> 13:41.166
- The Menkoff Method.
- Menkoff Method.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.539
Now, I'd like to avoid
this becoming

13:48.541 --> 13:51.456
some sort of worker's
compensation situation

13:51.458 --> 13:54.623
so, um, I can offer you
stress leave.

13:54.625 --> 13:59.289
If you wish? Though,
we're seriously understaffed.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.414
Would you like, um,
stress leave?

14:01.416 --> 14:05.373
Uh, no, I don't think so, no.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.708
Alright. Good. Good.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.456
Now, a counsellor?
I can offer you a counsellor.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.539
A good one.

14:14.541 --> 14:16.791
- No, that's okay.
- Ah, good.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.416
The bank is here for you,
David.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.833
If there's anything
that you might need...

14:24.125 --> 14:26.125
We do wish to contain
this situation.

14:27.416 --> 14:30.208
- Anything?
- Well, within reason.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.708
I'd like a 72-set limited
edition Copic marker pen pack.

14:39.166 --> 14:42.125
From Japan.
They're quite expensive.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.498
Oh, sweetie!

14:49.500 --> 14:53.041
Oh, sweetie, sweetie,
sweetie, sweetie...

14:54.041 --> 14:55.914
Mummy's here.

14:55.916 --> 14:57.998
- He's had an eye operation.
- Hmm.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.125
Poor little thing.
Oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi!

15:02.416 --> 15:04.083
We'll see what we can do.

15:05.416 --> 15:06.956
Thank you.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.875
If you could just
sign this here for me.

15:13.541 --> 15:16.750
What you did today, David,
was very, very brave.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.166
Now let's never
speak of it again.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.375
Go out, have a drink.

15:24.666 --> 15:26.250
You'll be fine.

15:35.875 --> 15:39.998
Fuck, take that mask off
and stop drawing comics.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.414
Place is crawling
with Endo workers.

15:42.416 --> 15:44.831
- Corporate chicks from HQ.
- They're not comics.

15:44.833 --> 15:49.623
Put it away. Mate, you're
a hero, start acting like one.

15:49.625 --> 15:52.831
- I shouldn't even be here.
- And put that away too.

15:52.833 --> 15:55.414
- Fuck me!
- I have a deadline.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.498
Karaoke time,
ladies and gents.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.206
Just shut up and drink. Relax.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.206
First up... Gary Barrett.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.833
Watch and absorb.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.375
Ah!

16:15.125 --> 16:18.789
♪ Workin' hard
to make a livin'

16:18.791 --> 16:22.623
♪ Bringin' shelter

16:22.625 --> 16:25.873
♪ A father, son

♪ He's a workin' class man?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.916

17:09.494 --> 17:12.498
Hey, none of that!

17:12.500 --> 17:14.373
- Off!
- Ow!

17:14.375 --> 17:17.914
- He broke the foldback!
- I'm sorry. Can I just...

17:17.915 --> 17:20.080
- Get off stage! Off!
- Let's get out of here.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.914
Excuse me.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.039
- Get him out!
- Can I finish my song?

17:24.040 --> 17:28.248
- Oh, my shoe! My shoe!
- You're grabbing me, mate!

17:28.250 --> 17:30.164
Mate, I just wanna finish

17:30.166 --> 17:31.583
- Wait.
- Come on, mate.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.873
Stay out.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.375
My shoe!

17:39.958 --> 17:41.458
I left my shoe behind.

17:43.958 --> 17:45.958
Let me guess - Cinderella?

17:50.250 --> 17:52.833
Mr. Curry?

17:54.208 --> 17:56.791
- Mr. Curry?
- Hmm.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.541
Sit.

18:06.625 --> 18:09.666
So, you're with the management
training program.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.333
You'll be shadowing me.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.375
We need good, sharp minds
in the bank.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.708
I came through
the MTP myself.

18:19.416 --> 18:20.708
Ah.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.873
First of all, anything you see
or hear in this office

18:25.875 --> 18:27.706
is strictly confidential.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.333
- Hmm?
- Of course.

18:29.958 --> 18:33.789
Second, you will not discuss
anything related to DPC2

18:33.791 --> 18:36.208
with anyone, least of
all board members.

18:36.541 --> 18:38.000
Past and present.

18:38.541 --> 18:40.998
Third, any correspondence
from a consultant named

18:41.000 --> 18:43.248
Max Menkoff - emails, calls -

18:43.250 --> 18:45.000
is really,
really confidential.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.375
- Understand?
- Yes, Mr. Curry.

18:48.541 --> 18:50.539
And if Rita or Heidi call,

18:50.541 --> 18:53.081
tell them I've been
transferred to Dubai.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.250
- Permanently. Uncontactable.
- Yes.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.000
Actually, don't write that down.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.916
Right, of course, Mr. Curry.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.583
Call me Guy.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.083
Yes.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.791
Now.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.375
- Guy?
- Relax.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.000
Watch and learn.

19:21.541 --> 19:25.250
- Is that all?
- Is that all... Guy?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.916
Right. Of course. Guy.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.416
Bye, Guy!

19:37.916 --> 19:39.706
Look, this may come

19:39.708 --> 19:41.914
as a very big surprise to you,
Mr. Menkoff,

19:41.916 --> 19:44.000
but I have been with this bank
for 25 years.

19:44.541 --> 19:49.331
I have outlasted eight CEOs,
five rebranding exercises,

19:49.333 --> 19:51.666
two mergers and
a hostile takeover bid.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.041
Y-you cannot just fire me.

19:55.208 --> 19:59.998
Ms. Werne, I served in
Afghanistan in 1980s.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.666
I see many people get 'fired'.

20:04.958 --> 20:08.375
And dogs is not acceptable.
No.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.958
Mr. Menkoff,
this is not Afghanistan.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.248
And if you touch my dog,

20:14.250 --> 20:16.956
I will set the RSPCA
on to you.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.333
Who?

20:19.416 --> 20:20.916
Da?

20:21.125 --> 20:25.331
Let me make myself very clear.
In English.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.581
Redeploy me
or I will report you

20:28.583 --> 20:31.916
to the Fair Work Commission
Tribunal for unfair dismissal.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.541
Very well.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.539
You will proofread
every document in system

20:37.541 --> 20:40.206
from June 1987 to today.

20:40.208 --> 20:43.208
You'll log all typographical
and grammatical errors.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.998
You will report daily progress
update to Svetlana directly.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.623
One hundred document per day.

20:49.625 --> 20:53.083
Failure to meet quota three
times, you are dismissed.

20:54.375 --> 20:57.291
- That's impossible.
- Take her.

21:08.833 --> 21:12.748
So to get the girl -
employee database.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.081
The mother lode.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.789
Tonight, when it's quiet, just
start going through 'em.

21:16.791 --> 21:20.456
Everyone's got a mugshot
but it has to be my computer.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.833
- Hey, Dave...
- Pretty busy, Louise. Yeah?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.708
Has to be my computer because
of the admin privileges.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.916
Not just a simple case
of breaking a code.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.998
No, this is a bank.
Security is paramount.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.500
Para-mount...

21:37.541 --> 21:40.164
MENKOFF, OVER PA: Workers of
data processing center #2,

21:40.166 --> 21:43.498
Credit Card Application
and Approval Division.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.914
My name is Max Menkoff.

21:45.916 --> 21:48.706
I am here because
you have failed.

21:48.708 --> 21:52.706
We must repeal workforce plan.
Then review.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.831
I will make change.
Do not resist.

21:55.833 --> 21:59.083
Compulsory vaccinations
will commence today.

21:59.166 --> 22:02.291
But now, please,
enjoy some cake.

22:02.333 --> 22:03.833
Password.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.333
- 'Barnsey.'
- Okay?

22:10.708 --> 22:13.291
Workforce reviews?
What is that about?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.333
At least they've got cake.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.250
Davai.

22:20.666 --> 22:22.125
Gospodi...

22:26.875 --> 22:28.708
Sidet!

22:47.750 --> 22:49.375
Who is he, Charlie?

22:49.916 --> 22:52.625
Ah... Who is he?

22:57.666 --> 23:01.875
Ooh, Charlie.
We've got ourselves a doozy.

23:07.750 --> 23:11.541
If all else fails,
polonium 210.

23:12.791 --> 23:14.791
My insurance policy.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.291
Ooh!

24:24.416 --> 24:26.039
Ruby Jackson.

25:12.458 --> 25:15.458
'75, Clowes Street, Prahran.'

25:30.708 --> 25:32.248
Ah!

25:32.250 --> 25:35.248
- Charlie. Hello, David.
- Hi.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.166
Charlie, Charlie,
it's okay, it's okay.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.666
I can give you a lift, David.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.123
You'll be pleased to know
I received

25:45.125 --> 25:46.748
a purchase order
for your pens,

25:46.750 --> 25:49.664
and Finance sent off
a wire transfer

25:49.666 --> 25:51.414
to the manufacturer in Japan
so...

25:51.416 --> 25:52.623
Great.

25:52.625 --> 25:55.166
...should receive them in about
five to ten working days.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.541
Thanks.

25:57.125 --> 25:58.583
You're going to drive,
are you, David?

25:58.666 --> 25:59.875
Oh, sorry.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.666
- You alright.
- Uh, yeah.

26:04.416 --> 26:06.375
Just think we should go.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.250
Something weird is going on
up there.

26:14.916 --> 26:17.291
- The water coolers?
- All of them.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.166
- But she didn't see you?
- No.

26:21.083 --> 26:23.375
Oh, that Mr. Menkoff,
he's an elusive man.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.458
His methods are questionable,
probably illegal.

26:27.875 --> 26:31.375
- Maybe he's KGB.
- Well, he's certainly not HR.

26:31.666 --> 26:32.958
We need to go to the police.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.500
Oh, what, and complain about
a consultant? Please.

26:36.041 --> 26:38.541
No, if you see anything else,
you come directly to me.

26:38.833 --> 26:41.500
Or if I'm unavailable,
straight to Head Office.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.164
Mr. Menkoff may have the DPC

26:44.166 --> 26:45.831
but we can always go
over his head.

26:45.833 --> 26:48.291
- Who to?
- The top.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.831
Mr. Menkoff has no idea
who he's dealing with.

26:54.833 --> 26:58.666
Consultants come and
consultants go, believe me.

27:00.083 --> 27:04.083
No, it's Head Office... or me.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.208
Direct line.

27:08.958 --> 27:11.000
We've got the bank's
reputation to think about.

27:12.208 --> 27:13.456
I'll give you my number too...

27:13.458 --> 27:15.625
Oh, David. I know
everything about you.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.083
Fury love.

27:43.791 --> 27:45.291
Happy power.

28:00.458 --> 28:01.958
Oi! Enough!

28:03.291 --> 28:05.416
- Hello?
- Uh...

28:06.041 --> 28:07.625
Hi.

28:09.083 --> 28:11.958
- That's my shoe.
- Uh, yes.

28:12.916 --> 28:14.625
From last night at the pub.

28:15.458 --> 28:17.083
And a rose.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.375
- Rubes, who is it?
- It's just some guy!

28:21.125 --> 28:23.708
You didn't think a rose
might be a bit creepy?

28:25.666 --> 28:29.000
- How did you know my address?
- I-I work at Endobank.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.291
At the DPC2.

28:31.833 --> 28:33.458
But I'm actually
a manga artist.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.583
I draw Foxy Chaos.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.539
And you were dressed like her

28:38.541 --> 28:41.833
so I-I thought you must be
a fan as well, like me.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.000
See?

28:45.250 --> 28:48.166
I-It was a dress-up party. I
hired the last costume there.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.250
What's your name?

28:56.208 --> 28:58.291
- Uh, David.
- Ruby?

28:58.833 --> 29:01.541
- Cork.
- What's going on? Who's this?

29:02.083 --> 29:03.331
- Uh...
- What's your name, bro?

29:03.333 --> 29:05.498
David Cork.
Thank you for the shoe.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.331
Brought my shoe back.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.331
- Amelia! Enough!
- Jason, your dog!

29:10.333 --> 29:12.039
- Amelia!
- Jason! Hold her!

29:12.041 --> 29:13.498
- Down! Stop!
- Stop her!

29:13.500 --> 29:15.041
- Jason, pull her back!
- Desist!

29:54.458 --> 29:56.250
Idiot!

30:04.083 --> 30:05.708
I fucked up, Philby.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.916
I fucked up.

30:41.958 --> 30:44.458
Sensei Fujimoro,
I have something to show you.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.666
I have already seen.

30:54.208 --> 30:57.458
You are eighth son
of the Storm Nebula.

30:58.458 --> 31:01.541
Do not kill the child
to become the man.

31:04.791 --> 31:07.791
Do not eat the breeze.

31:09.333 --> 31:10.666
What?

31:23.583 --> 31:24.791
Foxy?

32:15.833 --> 32:16.998
Yes?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.500
Don't drink that, it's spiked.

32:21.666 --> 32:23.458
I must finish work plan.

32:25.291 --> 32:28.708
- What?
- KPIs will be met.

32:31.208 --> 32:33.208
Gary. I found her.

32:34.416 --> 32:36.750
New data. Must upload.

32:37.583 --> 32:40.875
- The girl... with the shoe.
- Shh!

33:19.083 --> 33:21.250
'Bank-owned life insurance.'

33:29.375 --> 33:30.875
All these people.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.291
Beneficiary - Max Menkoff.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.873
The patient's going to need
a full blood transfusion.

33:39.875 --> 33:42.041
Yep, and can you include
an I&R with that?

33:43.125 --> 33:44.625
Brilliant. Thanks very much.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.748
Right, love. You wanna just
take your jacket off for me?

33:50.750 --> 33:53.416
Your jacket. You want to
just take it off for me?

33:56.875 --> 33:58.250
Alright, here we go.

33:59.666 --> 34:01.166
Oh, I didn't sign
a consent form.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.789
Oh, don't you worry
about that, darling.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.375
We're all friends here. It's
just a compulsory vaccination.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.541
A consent is a regulatory requirement.

34:08.166 --> 34:10.000
It's procedure.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.333
Hello?

34:21.791 --> 34:23.625
'Need consent'?

34:25.208 --> 34:27.164
It's an offense under
workplace health

34:27.166 --> 34:29.123
and safety legislation
to administer a vaccination

34:29.125 --> 34:30.331
without the explicit
written consent

34:30.333 --> 34:31.750
from the employee concerned.

34:32.125 --> 34:33.498
Look, I'm just doing me job.

34:33.500 --> 34:34.873
Not only are you in breach of

34:34.875 --> 34:37.164
National Health Practitioner
Regulation law

34:37.166 --> 34:37.998
but you're exposing the bank

34:38.000 --> 34:39.748
to potentially significant
liability.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.373
I will raise this
with Mr. Menkoff.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.583
Whoa! Alright, love,
I'll tick your name off.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.748
You just take yer
fuckin' lollipop and go.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.706
- Language.
- I'm Glaswegian, woman!

34:48.708 --> 34:50.208
What the fuck did you expect?

35:16.750 --> 35:18.250
Phil... Phil!

35:20.666 --> 35:22.414
No. Phil. Phil.

35:22.416 --> 35:24.166
Phil!

35:29.583 --> 35:31.083
- Name?
- David.

35:32.541 --> 35:33.958
David Cork.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.956
You look tired.

35:38.958 --> 35:41.164
- Why you tired?
- He draws, Mr. Menkoff.

35:41.166 --> 35:43.416
- He always draws...
- Shh!

35:44.416 --> 35:45.458
Answer!

35:49.625 --> 35:52.664
You have not had vaccination.
Take him away. Watch him.

35:52.666 --> 35:54.456
We cannot afford problems.

35:54.458 --> 35:57.000
Alright. Off we go, come on!

36:01.041 --> 36:03.539
Bad reaction.
He needs antidote.

36:03.541 --> 36:06.041
No, no, no, no waste antidote.
It's no problem.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.583
He looks alright.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.458
- Uh, can I have that back?
- No, come on.

36:14.416 --> 36:17.625
Wait, wait. Wait!

36:20.833 --> 36:21.916
Yes, Max.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.500
Yes, Max.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.498
Yes, Max. Okay.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.833
Go on. Go on.

36:28.875 --> 36:30.664
Okay, I do it right now, Max.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.166
Don't worry.

36:32.666 --> 36:35.664
- Hi.
- What is it?

36:35.666 --> 36:37.498
I-I need to get an injection?

36:37.500 --> 36:40.081
Aye, well, I'm meant to be
knocking off.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.791
And I need
a fucking cigarette.

36:42.625 --> 36:45.123
Look, I'm coming back
to cover people on leave.

36:45.125 --> 36:46.708
You'll have to make
an appointment.

36:47.458 --> 36:49.081
Well, go on!
The books are there.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.539
Go put your name down.

36:50.541 --> 36:52.373
Ah, Jesus, it's only a vaccination,

36:52.375 --> 36:54.623
ya stupid little shite,
no big fucking deal.

37:06.333 --> 37:09.873
Attention all staff,
this is Max Menkoff.

37:09.875 --> 37:13.498
Report immediately
to car park evacuation point

37:13.500 --> 37:16.039
for compulsory callisthenics
with colleague Svetlana.

37:16.041 --> 37:18.291
- That is all.
- 'Avoid vacc. Need consent'

37:31.958 --> 37:33.458
That should work.

38:02.708 --> 38:04.248
Excuse me, Marjorie.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.500
Sorry.

38:06.583 --> 38:08.625
Go! Hide, hide, hide. Go. Go!

38:09.500 --> 38:10.625
Stay.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.916
Good morning.
Thanks for meeting with me.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.333
- You've had vaccination?
- No, I haven't.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.208
Please, take a seat.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.416
I'm not a fool, Mr. Menkoff.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.166
I know you're up to something.

38:52.708 --> 38:54.956
- Ms. Werne...
- I don't understand it.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.581
I don't want to understand it.

38:56.583 --> 39:01.248
Whatever it is, it's highly
irregular and unorthodox.

39:01.250 --> 39:02.916
Such things should be avoided.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.458
What is your point, Ms. Werne?

39:07.041 --> 39:08.375
Immunity.

39:08.916 --> 39:11.164
I want a guarantee
that whatever it is

39:11.166 --> 39:13.956
that you are up to, I will not
be dragged me down into it.

39:13.958 --> 39:15.706
I have a reputation
to maintain...

39:15.708 --> 39:16.914
I'm sorry...

39:16.916 --> 39:19.083
I am part of the furniture
here, Mr. Menkoff.

39:20.291 --> 39:24.581
I know people in very high
places in this organisation.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.166
And I am known.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.791
I will be accommodated
and I will be protected.

39:30.291 --> 39:32.958
And I will not be
under-utilised.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.789
I'm sorry,
this is about your work?

39:35.791 --> 39:38.083
Oh, you find this amusing,
do you?

39:39.625 --> 39:42.625
No, is not amusing. Is, uh...

39:43.875 --> 39:45.748
Is waste. Waste is problem.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.581
Then we understand
each other.

39:47.583 --> 39:50.375
Completely.
Time to go, Ms. Werne.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.581
Max! Down!

40:00.625 --> 40:02.083
Shoot him!

40:04.375 --> 40:07.164
- Got him!
- Not him, the other one!

40:07.166 --> 40:09.498
- There is other one?
- The other one!

40:09.500 --> 40:11.331
Fucking idiot!

40:11.333 --> 40:13.166
Eh, Max? He's fucking idiot!

40:18.416 --> 40:20.748
I think I got him.

40:24.208 --> 40:25.833
- Ah!
- Okay!

40:38.916 --> 40:42.125
Okay, Max, I think we did it.

40:44.791 --> 40:47.123
- Fucking hate this guy.
- Eh?

40:47.125 --> 40:49.914
I had good line,
he ruined my line.

40:49.916 --> 40:53.581
- What was line?
- Ms. Werne, you're fired.

40:53.583 --> 40:56.123
Yeah, not so good line.

40:56.125 --> 41:00.123
Okay, uh, Ms. Werne,
under-utilise this!

41:00.125 --> 41:02.164
Yes, is better.

41:02.166 --> 41:05.914
- Find dog. He knows too much.
- Sure, Max.

41:05.916 --> 41:09.331
- I need drink.
- Don't worry, Max.

41:09.333 --> 41:13.833
I will clean this up and
I will find your little doggy.

41:15.916 --> 41:18.250
Here, doggy, doggy,
doggy, doggy.

41:18.541 --> 41:21.208
Here, little doggy,
doggy, doggy...

41:27.208 --> 41:31.208
Here, little doggy, doggy,
doggy, doggy.

41:37.791 --> 41:40.375
Here, doggy, doggy,
doggy, doggy...

41:49.625 --> 41:52.416
Here, doggy, doggy,
doggy, doggy...

42:12.708 --> 42:14.333
- Guy Curry's office.
- Yes.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.750
I'd like to talk
to Mr. Curry.

42:18.416 --> 42:20.414
Can I say who's calling?

42:20.416 --> 42:25.458
- Uh, it's about a consultant.
- Which consultant?

42:27.166 --> 42:29.166
Uh, Max Menkoff.

42:30.416 --> 42:33.416
Right, yes. Who's speaking?

42:35.041 --> 42:37.039
I really need to talk
to Mr. Curry.

42:37.041 --> 42:38.541
I can take a message.

42:39.708 --> 42:42.833
- Or we could... meet?
- Meet? Um...

42:43.958 --> 42:46.248
Tonight. I could meet you
after work.

42:46.250 --> 42:48.289
You can trust me.

42:48.291 --> 42:52.123
You choose the venue.
Somewhere safe. Okay?

42:52.125 --> 42:53.664
Okay.

42:53.666 --> 42:57.873
Uh, 114, Chapel Street.

42:57.875 --> 43:00.833
7 PM. I'll carry a red handbag.

43:02.375 --> 43:04.750
See you then. Okay? Bye.

43:30.041 --> 43:31.541
Holy Toledo!

43:38.666 --> 43:40.166
Why don't you take a picture?

43:41.541 --> 43:43.750
Why don't you get into
some lycra and we will?

43:47.625 --> 43:49.750
Go on, use your phone.

43:50.375 --> 43:52.041
Tweet it.

43:53.208 --> 43:55.208
- I use Instagram.
- Oh.

44:00.958 --> 44:04.081
Pucks!

44:04.083 --> 44:05.956
Ha!

44:05.958 --> 44:07.539
Hai!

44:07.541 --> 44:09.666
Huh!

44:15.208 --> 44:16.916
I don't do lycra.

44:23.416 --> 44:25.083
Gotta be kidding me.

44:26.458 --> 44:27.873
Wait.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.291
Wait!

44:29.625 --> 44:31.206
I didn't know it was you
on the phone.

44:31.208 --> 44:33.625
- Yeah, sure, whatever.
- Please.

44:34.541 --> 44:35.833
Piss off.

44:36.291 --> 44:37.956
You're the one who wanted
to talk to me.

44:37.958 --> 44:40.248
Yeah, well, I didn't know
it was you at the time.

44:40.250 --> 44:42.081
I didn't know it was you either.

44:46.833 --> 44:49.416
This Menkoff, do you know him?

44:52.166 --> 44:53.833
What do you know?

44:56.375 --> 45:00.248
- Marjorie Werne. DPC Admin.
- HR.

45:00.250 --> 45:02.166
She coordinates the data
processing training program.

45:03.041 --> 45:06.166
- What about her?
- She's dead.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.706
- What?
- Deceased.

45:08.708 --> 45:11.041
They killed her
and now she's totally dead.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.166
I hid and when I came out...

45:15.833 --> 45:18.041
I don't even know what
they did with her body.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.375
- I want to talk to Mr. Curry.
- I said you could trust me.

45:28.208 --> 45:31.123
This was a really weird place
to meet. Do you know that?

45:31.125 --> 45:32.875
You said you wanted
somewhere safe.

45:34.333 --> 45:35.541
Come on.

45:36.875 --> 45:38.914
Whatever it is they're putting
in the water coolers

45:38.916 --> 45:40.541
seems to trigger them
into droids.

45:40.833 --> 45:42.666
- Droids?
- Yes.

45:44.416 --> 45:47.583
Gary doesn't talk to me
anymore, he just... works.

45:49.500 --> 45:53.250
- You can't go back there.
- I have to get my manga back.

45:55.166 --> 45:56.789
I can't start again.

45:56.791 --> 45:59.581
If they find out what you saw,
they will kill you too.

45:59.583 --> 46:01.125
I need my manga.

46:02.791 --> 46:04.914
And someone has to feed Charlie.

46:04.916 --> 46:06.000
Charlie?

46:06.750 --> 46:08.041
Marjorie's dog.

46:10.500 --> 46:12.083
Well, be careful.

46:13.125 --> 46:14.583
Find out what you can.

46:17.750 --> 46:18.791
Ruby?

46:22.291 --> 46:23.916
Is it okay if I Facebook you?

46:25.250 --> 46:30.041
- Sure. Facebook. Whatever.
- Great.

46:32.625 --> 46:35.375
- I'm gonna go now.
- Okay.

46:54.875 --> 46:56.998
- Ruby.
- Clive. I need...

46:57.000 --> 47:00.248
I can't speak to a bank staff
while I'm under investigation.

47:00.250 --> 47:01.831
- I'm sorry.
- Can I come in?

47:01.833 --> 47:03.998
- Absolutely not.
- Clive, it's Curry.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.873
He's taken out bank-owned
life insurance policies.

47:06.875 --> 47:08.708
He's named a consultant
beneficiary.

47:09.666 --> 47:12.458
BOLI policy? Endobank?
It's impossible.

47:13.166 --> 47:14.539
Harold would have no part
in that.

47:14.541 --> 47:15.916
I've seen the policies.

47:17.166 --> 47:19.916
The consultant
is a guy called Max Menkoff.

47:20.625 --> 47:22.164
He's been injecting
the employees.

47:22.166 --> 47:23.750
They end up like robots.

47:24.625 --> 47:25.833
And Marjorie Werne is dead.

47:27.791 --> 47:29.623
- What?
- There was a shooting.

47:29.625 --> 47:31.125
She was killed.

47:32.416 --> 47:33.706
You saw that?

47:33.708 --> 47:35.625
No. A guy at the DPC
told me.

47:36.625 --> 47:38.625
- Right. Right.
- You've got to help us.

47:40.375 --> 47:42.041
This is incredulous.

47:42.750 --> 47:44.041
All this in a matter of days?

47:45.958 --> 47:48.373
This place is probably
under surveillance.

47:48.375 --> 47:49.458
Just go.

47:50.750 --> 47:52.706
'All it takes for evil
to triumph

47:52.708 --> 47:54.666
is for good men
to do nothing.'

47:55.875 --> 47:57.083
You taught me that.

Alright, now, very careful

49:14.583 --> 49:17.456
Make sure... Make sure
you don't drop anything.

49:17.458 --> 49:19.789
Wait for lift. Careful.
Steady, steady.

49:19.791 --> 49:21.291
Wait, wait for lift.

49:23.083 --> 49:25.458
Ah, David.

49:27.083 --> 49:28.498
David Cork.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.998
Excuse me, excuse me. Please.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.914
Okay, everybody, in the lift.

49:33.916 --> 49:35.998
There we go. Down to four.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.581
You're into the lift.

49:37.583 --> 49:39.581
That is right. Hey!
Come on, idiot.

49:39.583 --> 49:41.414
Get in there. Get in there.

49:41.416 --> 49:44.664
When you go into the foyer,
do not come back.

49:44.666 --> 49:47.206
Keep going, do not come back.
You are fired.

49:47.208 --> 49:49.083
Okay? You're fired. Goodbye!

49:50.041 --> 49:51.375
Goodbye.

49:57.125 --> 50:01.708
Pst! Tell me,
what happens in the end?

50:03.708 --> 50:05.414
Must attain KPIs.

50:05.416 --> 50:08.956
No, no, no,
I'm not talking about that.

50:08.958 --> 50:10.914
I'm talking about comic.

50:10.916 --> 50:13.291
Foxy Chaos. Right?

50:15.125 --> 50:18.708
Look, the last few pages.

50:19.750 --> 50:20.831
It's not finished.

50:20.833 --> 50:22.500
What happens?

50:23.916 --> 50:25.916
Listen to me, David Cork!

50:29.125 --> 50:33.039
Does she get away?

50:33.041 --> 50:34.541
Yes?

50:41.166 --> 50:43.289
Yes, I knew it!

50:43.291 --> 50:46.873
I knew it!
Yes, you make me so happy.

50:46.875 --> 50:49.456
I knew it here.
You're good man.

50:49.458 --> 50:51.664
Ah... Good.

50:51.666 --> 50:53.666
I wonder...

50:55.041 --> 50:57.164
Would you like to finish it
for me?

50:57.166 --> 50:59.625
I would like to see ending.

51:02.416 --> 51:04.791
Must attain KPIs.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.500
Yes. Right.

51:07.958 --> 51:09.914
No, yes, no, you're right.

51:09.916 --> 51:13.581
Shit. Shit. I don't know
what am I thinking.

51:13.583 --> 51:15.000
Okay. Okay.

51:34.125 --> 51:37.541
- He's here, Mr. Curry.
- Good. Out.

51:55.166 --> 51:56.664
Max!

51:56.666 --> 51:59.083
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

52:01.541 --> 52:04.083
Ah. So, how's it going?

52:05.291 --> 52:07.123
Implementation is very smooth.

52:07.125 --> 52:09.791
We will proceed with planning
for full rollout.

52:09.958 --> 52:14.039
- Many logistical challenges.
- I see. I see.

52:14.041 --> 52:15.248
Hm...

52:15.250 --> 52:18.164
- The Method is effective.
- Yes, I can see that.

52:18.166 --> 52:19.791
It's... it's admirable.

52:21.875 --> 52:23.539
I'm not so sure
we can go through

52:23.541 --> 52:25.206
with the full rollout, though.

52:25.208 --> 52:27.039
Why not?

52:27.041 --> 52:30.458
I have to consider
my position, Max. It's risky.

52:30.708 --> 52:32.706
The Method is effective.

52:32.708 --> 52:35.873
The 4-7% rapid and permanent
loss of cognitive function,

52:35.875 --> 52:37.706
we can maybe get away
with that in the DPC

52:37.708 --> 52:39.125
but the whole bank...

52:39.541 --> 52:42.914
The error rate is acceptable.
This is simply turnover.

52:42.916 --> 52:44.831
- This is not problem.
- It's not personal, Max.

52:44.833 --> 52:47.373
It's business.
You drove a hard bargain -

52:47.375 --> 52:50.206
the BOLI policies for
your kids, your grandkids.

52:50.208 --> 52:53.748
You've provided. I just
can't back a full rollout.

52:53.750 --> 52:56.623
- It's just prudent.
- That is your final position?

52:56.625 --> 52:59.250
- I'm sorry.
- Hm. So am I.

53:01.208 --> 53:02.581
Ah!

53:02.583 --> 53:04.539
Shh, it's only little needle.

53:04.541 --> 53:06.831
Fucker! You mad fucker!

53:06.833 --> 53:08.664
You know I've got
the antidote...

53:12.083 --> 53:14.708
Your contract is terminated.

53:24.083 --> 53:25.664
You'll not use antidote.

53:25.666 --> 53:28.833
You'll keep antidote
in safe, secure location.

53:29.666 --> 53:31.706
I will not use antidote.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.916
I will keep antidote
in safe, secure location.

53:35.250 --> 53:37.331
At tomorrow's management meeting,

53:37.333 --> 53:40.248
you will recommend
full rollout immediately.

53:40.250 --> 53:42.081
Yes, Mr. Menkoff.

53:42.083 --> 53:44.291
- Thirsty?
- Yes, Mr. Menkoff.

53:46.250 --> 53:49.664
Keep antidote
in safe, secure location.

53:49.666 --> 53:51.083
Good.

53:52.750 --> 53:55.039
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, uh...

53:55.041 --> 53:57.166
I was just leaving.

53:58.083 --> 54:00.666
- I am, uh, consultant.
- Ah.

54:11.208 --> 54:12.708
Ready?

54:40.208 --> 54:41.416
Oh, shit.

54:53.666 --> 54:55.250
Hey. How's life?

54:55.791 --> 54:57.706
How much do you know
about computers?

54:57.708 --> 55:01.289
Uh, the first computer
dates back to the early 1940s

55:01.291 --> 55:02.914
when Konrad Zuse invented...

55:02.916 --> 55:04.248
- David.
- Yes?

55:04.250 --> 55:07.414
Cease. I need to access
some files of Curry's

55:07.416 --> 55:09.539
but how do I get in
without a password?

55:09.541 --> 55:12.623
Uh, you'd need
admin privileges.

55:12.625 --> 55:14.791
How do I do that?
Can you get them?

55:20.041 --> 55:21.208
Can you?

55:22.416 --> 55:24.208
So, how's your day been?

55:25.083 --> 55:26.333
David?

55:28.625 --> 55:32.873
Okay, I can log in remotely
and change the password.

55:32.875 --> 55:34.041
Great.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.831
- I'm in.
- Be quick.

55:37.833 --> 55:39.914
Curry is at a short meeting.

55:39.916 --> 55:42.748
There's an antidote. We just
need to find out where it is.

55:42.750 --> 55:45.541
Okay, the new password
is 'Foxy'.

55:46.958 --> 55:48.873
- Holy mackerel.
- What?

55:48.875 --> 55:51.873
Um, encrypted. The files.

55:51.875 --> 55:53.583
I can see 'em
but I can't read them.

55:55.166 --> 55:56.375
Can you uncrypt them?

56:00.166 --> 56:03.333
- That's my workstation.
- David?

56:04.750 --> 56:05.875
Vacate.

56:07.333 --> 56:08.748
David!

56:08.750 --> 56:11.375
I have
instructions from Mr. Menkoff.

56:17.333 --> 56:18.789
What's happening?

56:18.791 --> 56:20.791
David, come on.
We've got to hurry!

56:27.791 --> 56:30.375
- Amazing!
- Nearly there.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.331
Hurry.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.083
Got it!

56:52.791 --> 56:54.623
Mr. Curry! How was the meeting?

56:54.625 --> 56:58.041
Water. Water. Water.

57:05.625 --> 57:07.833
Work. Work. Work.

57:19.416 --> 57:20.875
You...

57:22.625 --> 57:23.833
Yes?

57:25.416 --> 57:29.250
- Coffee?
- Of course, Mr. Curry.

57:38.500 --> 57:39.958
Excellent idea.

57:51.291 --> 57:55.416
'Cork. David Cork.'

58:02.250 --> 58:04.250
'Marjorie Werne.'

58:06.458 --> 58:08.333
Wait.

58:19.083 --> 58:21.789
A little doggy.

58:35.083 --> 58:36.664
They make no sense.

58:36.666 --> 58:38.414
Some kind of codes,
coordinates.

58:38.416 --> 58:39.831
What do you think?

58:39.833 --> 58:41.914
Shouldn't be too hard, right?

58:41.916 --> 58:44.123
I mean, you got through
all that encryption.

58:44.125 --> 58:45.914
Surely, this is...

58:45.916 --> 58:48.625
Ruby, I don't know.

58:54.375 --> 58:55.500
Clive!

59:12.458 --> 59:14.789
- Go away!
- You have to see these!

59:14.791 --> 59:15.498
I will not!

59:15.500 --> 59:17.791
I will stay here all night
if I have to.

59:19.833 --> 59:20.958
Clive!

59:23.250 --> 59:25.039
For goodness' sake!

59:25.041 --> 59:27.123
All of the staff have been
injected

59:27.125 --> 59:29.623
with a performance-enhancing
drug. There's an...

59:29.625 --> 59:31.581
Leave now or
I'll call the police.

59:31.583 --> 59:33.083
I saw Marjorie Werne killed.

59:33.875 --> 59:36.206
She was shot.
By a window cleaner

59:36.208 --> 59:37.956
who was shooting at
Mr. Menkoff.

59:37.958 --> 59:40.081
It was really weird
but she had told me

59:40.083 --> 59:43.625
to call Head Office if...
And I did.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.875
But we can't trust Mr. Curry.

59:50.708 --> 59:52.125
Please, Clive.

59:53.833 --> 59:55.083
Good Lord...

59:56.958 --> 59:58.041
Look.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:03.456
This sequence pertains to

01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:05.498
an underground vault complex
at HQ.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.083
Where the antidote is stored.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:10.958
You're the only person in
the world who can get to that.

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.583
I'll have to get
into the building first.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.289
Only way in is through
the main foyer.

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:23.956
There's no way not to be seen.

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:27.123
I'm not supposed to be
within 200m.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:30.914
You go in, you get it and you
take it to David at the DPC.

01:00:30.916 --> 01:00:32.500
They'll recognize me.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.664
Not if you're dressed
as a technician.

01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:37.000
Spare me.

01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:41.331
- Clive?
- You can crash here tonight.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:44.666
- If it's easier.
- How could I refuse?

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.833
Do you snore?

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:50.166
I'm 56 years old and...

01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:53.583
..I've been drinking.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.416
You take the couch.

01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:01.416
And you, don't get any ideas.

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:14.706
To Karpov's incredibly fat mother.

01:01:18.791 --> 01:01:20.914
And his stupid father.

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:22.416
Oh.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.998
Karpov, did you find
your little doggy?

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:35.000
The little doggy, it is a spy.

01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:44.706
And the boy with the comic,
he has not had vaccination.

01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:46.623
But I sent him with you.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:49.331
Yes, he went in
to see the nurse.

01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:52.789
But now I think he is
connected to Marjorie Werne.

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:56.436
W-What? I-I sent you with him!

01:01:56.438 --> 01:01:59.333
He went into sick room but
then you called me away.

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:00.583
Remember, Max?

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:03.000
Look.

01:02:04.583 --> 01:02:06.916
Look here. You see?

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:10.916
The doctor, Dr. Mishi.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:14.206
Injections.
And here is a little doggy.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:16.164
And here they are shooting

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.956
and she runs away
with the little doggy.

01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:21.623
I have discovered a spy!

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:23.456
- Karpov. Karpov.
- What?

01:02:23.458 --> 01:02:26.206
Ah! Max!
Why you do this to me?

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:27.791
- Fucking idiot!
- Max.

01:02:29.041 --> 01:02:31.081
W-Why do you say Marjorie?

01:02:31.083 --> 01:02:35.789
Because of the register.
The vaccination register.

01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.539
You believe he saw?

01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:40.083
Here, the dog,
the dog biscuits.

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:44.623
- Where?
- In the storeroom.

01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:47.208
On the top floor,
on Marjorie's floor.

01:02:49.375 --> 01:02:51.000
And what is this?

01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:55.583
Hmm... I do not know.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:01.083
Sorry. It's a bit of a mess.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.708
We'll fix it.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.664
Clive will get the antidote,
we'll rescue the workers

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:08.166
and they'll tell their story.

01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:11.750
- I meant the room.
- Huh?

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:16.250
The room,
it's a bit of a mess.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.291
You know, your work...

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:21.750
..It's really good.

01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:24.958
Thanks.

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:29.416
We should get some sleep.
Big day tomorrow.

01:03:29.458 --> 01:03:30.541
Sure.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.291
Which side
did you want to sleep on?

01:03:38.083 --> 01:03:39.583
Uh, don't care.

01:03:41.291 --> 01:03:43.416
I think I'd better take
the Philby side.

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:47.125
He might get a bit...
freaked out if I didn't.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.041
Sure.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.583
How long have you been
doing this?

01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:03.333
Since I was a kid.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:07.958
You should get a job
illustrating.

01:04:08.083 --> 01:04:10.375
You're wasted at the DPC.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:15.958
You should see my new book.
It's much better.

01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:19.541
I actually do my best work
at the DPC.

01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:24.500
Well, I did until
the Russian people arrived.

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.750
Oh, shit.

01:04:33.958 --> 01:04:35.041
Jase?

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:39.583
Sorry, no, I'm fine, I'm
just... staying at a friend's.

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:43.458
Yeah. Yep.

01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:48.416
See you tomorrow. Bye.

01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:59.625
- Ruby? Was that...
- Jason?

01:04:59.916 --> 01:05:02.125
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:05.250
Very concerned
for my wellbeing.

01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:09.250
I'm cool with that.

01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:16.208
- You met him. Briefly.
- Sure.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.833
Do you have a brother?

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:25.666
Brother?

01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:29.958
No.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.750
I'm lucky, I guess.

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:38.916
Goodnight.

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.416
Goodnight.

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:51.625
Goodnight, Philby.

01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:31.666
You're fucked.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.541
Hm.

01:07:09.541 --> 01:07:11.375
- Black belt?
- Third dan.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.916
Oh, shit.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:25.291
Water.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.289
Morning, Guy. Walk and talk?

01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:34.498
Just want to get the lowdown
on this HR system rollout.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.833
Um, Menkoff?

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:40.123
- Rollout.
- Feeling better this morning?

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:43.250
Rollout. Must order rollout.

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:48.583
- Sure. Let's walk and talk.
- Rollout.

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:13.166
Gentlemen!

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:15.914
- Maintenance - vaults.
- What?

01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:21.041
You've got a Binkley 52
multi-locking system, right?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.250
It's due for routine
maintenance. Overdue.

01:08:24.416 --> 01:08:26.456
- Do we?
- You mean the empty one?

01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:28.875
I thought they checked
that one last month.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.247
- I'll check the register.
- Cancelled.

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:34.250
Meant to be. Got cancelled.

01:08:37.457 --> 01:08:39.081
No, I'm sure they did it.

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:42.706
Listen. It's a fuck-up.

01:08:42.707 --> 01:08:46.538
I had some woman troubles,
if you know what I mean.

01:08:46.541 --> 01:08:48.706
You'd be doing me
a big favor.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:52.206
I mean, we all know
that Simon would be pissed off

01:08:52.207 --> 01:08:53.706
if he knew about it, right?

01:08:53.707 --> 01:08:55.500
That's for sure, yeah.

01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:58.747
It's Friday, right?
So he's not on today.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.916
We get in, we get out,
no-one's any wiser.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.581
Just a couple of minutes.

01:09:03.582 --> 01:09:05.372
If you want while
I'm down there,

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:06.832
I'll check the Felton 2000.

01:09:09.082 --> 01:09:10.457
I'll go with him.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.163
You right there?

01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:18.788
Um, on this third
recommendation here,

01:09:18.791 --> 01:09:20.288
I'm concerned about the data

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.332
that's going to perhaps
be lost in...

01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:26.747
Um, and has this all
been put into place already?

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:30.375
Because I really don't think
this follows normal protocol.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:34.250
Rollover. Must order...

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.750
Guy?

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:40.916
Guy?

01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:45.956
Yeah, I got me own
woman troubles.

01:09:45.957 --> 01:09:47.997
I don't know what goes on.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.163
Sometimes, you know,
the brain they have,

01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:53.125
I think it's smaller than
a male brain.

01:09:53.166 --> 01:09:55.166
The shit they worry about.

01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:59.331
Shouldn't you have more tools?

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:03.331
No, my friend.
It's all digital these days.

01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:24.958
Ah...

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:26.708
..five, six, one.

01:10:37.375 --> 01:10:38.833
Weird bottle.

01:10:39.041 --> 01:10:44.081
Oh, special oil for,
you know, lubrication.

01:10:44.083 --> 01:10:46.250
Titanium tumblers, so...

01:10:47.958 --> 01:10:50.958
- What's it doing in there?
- It's volatile so, um...

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:53.956
Yeah, right.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.333
Now, it needs to be kept
at a stable temperature.

01:10:58.166 --> 01:10:59.541
- Yeah.
- Um...

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.331
I think it's a little unstable
right now so...

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:05.039
- I'll step out...
- No, no, no.

01:11:05.041 --> 01:11:07.914
Stay. I'll just step
into that corridor there

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:10.000
and create a shield, so...

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.539
Uh, give me your two-way.

01:11:13.541 --> 01:11:15.250
Just in case
I got to call Central.

01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:19.958
Thanks.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.541
Is it okay?

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:39.206
Jesus Christ, Terry!
Get up here!

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:41.208
Guy Curry's fallen down
the fucking lift well!

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:42.541
On my way.

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:49.250
Clive?

01:11:50.541 --> 01:11:52.625
Hey! Quick!

01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:03.373
Shit! Shit! Idiot!

01:12:03.375 --> 01:12:04.625
Shit!

01:12:08.666 --> 01:12:10.166
Shit!

01:12:19.416 --> 01:12:21.416
Who the fuck was that?!

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.000
Girl, hit boy.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Ruby?

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:56.875
What is this, this Foxy Chaos?

01:12:57.875 --> 01:12:59.248
She spreads the Love Force

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.166
throughout
the Second Universe.

01:13:01.583 --> 01:13:04.291
You wouldn't understand.

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:09.125
Do you understand
radioactive isotope?

01:13:09.208 --> 01:13:11.206
Polonium 210.

01:13:11.208 --> 01:13:14.833
Median lethal dose -
0.089 microgram.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:20.583
250,000 time more toxic
than hydrogen cyanide.

01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:26.081
Put in air conditioner, people
breathe in, people get sick,

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:28.250
people die slow.

01:13:28.583 --> 01:13:32.414
One month or two month, three,
maybe a year.

01:13:32.416 --> 01:13:35.623
Nobody knows how.
Nobody can trace.

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:38.998
When all else fails,
it is good to be insured.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.833
Da, Svetlana?

01:13:42.041 --> 01:13:45.831
Svetlana wants to do you
old-fashioned way.

01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:49.333
We convene in car park
five minutes.

01:13:51.666 --> 01:13:54.958
- Uh, Mr. Menkoff...
- You. Stay.

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:57.498
You don't have
an insurance policy on her.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.375
- S-She doesn't have to die.
- I don't care. Hm?

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:08.583
Have fun! Karpov!

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:30.166
- You. Stay.
- Ruby... Ruby...

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:32.081
Ruby...

01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:34.039
I said stay.

01:15:34.041 --> 01:15:36.208
Hah! Ah!

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:42.583
Ruby?

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:17.208
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.083
Stop!

01:16:19.166 --> 01:16:20.748
I said stop! Stop!

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:21.916
Stop!

01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:56.041
Fucking idiot.

01:16:56.958 --> 01:16:59.125
Poor fucking idiot.

01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:02.500
Ruby, are you okay?

01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:03.833
Ruby?

01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:12.916
We have to hurry.

01:17:24.041 --> 01:17:26.583
- Hey!
- Everybody needs to get out!

01:17:26.666 --> 01:17:28.289
- Out!
- You need to get out.

01:17:28.291 --> 01:17:31.123
- Gary! Gary!
- The antidote! The antidote!

01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:32.914
No time!
There's too many of them!

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:34.333
Gary!

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:55.291
Dear DPC staff,
this is Max Menkoff.

01:17:55.708 --> 01:17:57.123
What the blyad?

01:17:57.125 --> 01:18:00.248
Report for usual
callisthenics class.

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:01.789
No! No, no, no!

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:04.289
Please use emergency stairwell only.

01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:05.666
That is all.

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.375
Yes!

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.125
Attention all staff!

01:18:21.208 --> 01:18:22.706
This is Max Menkoff!

01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:25.039
Return immediately to office!

01:18:25.041 --> 01:18:27.041
Exercises cancelled now!

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.333
No, no, no, wait.
No, no, no, no.

01:18:29.416 --> 01:18:30.416
That is all!

01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:43.625
Stop!

01:18:43.958 --> 01:18:45.708
I'm shaking in my botinki.

01:18:45.833 --> 01:18:47.833
Hey, look,
it's your girlfriend. Get him!

01:18:48.333 --> 01:18:49.333
Hah!

01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:51.708
- Now finish him up!
- Play along.

01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:54.208
- I don't like this game.
- Hah!

01:18:54.416 --> 01:18:56.206
Harder! Harder!

01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:59.206
- Wait, I ordered you to stay.
- Whoops.

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:04.081
Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:05.875
Bad doggy! Bad doggy! Ow!

01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:20.333
I hate this guy!

01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.291
Yah!

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:37.750
- Ruby, watch out!
- Ah!

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:51.041
Where he go?

01:19:52.916 --> 01:19:54.791
Yah!

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:14.541
Quick, press that!

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.708
Whoa...

01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:29.041
Ruby? Okay...

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.166
What, idiot?

01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:43.291
Let go!

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:49.289
- Let go!
- Under-utilize this!

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:50.958
Ow!

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.875
'Under-utilize this'?

01:21:06.166 --> 01:21:08.833
I-It's a window-washing term.

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:12.625
Wow. Tough day at the office.

01:21:13.083 --> 01:21:14.375
Yeah.

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:19.375
- I quit.
- Good for you.

01:21:28.208 --> 01:21:29.375
Wow.

01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:32.291
Not like a Rottweiler at all.

01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:39.416
Great. Good.

01:21:40.541 --> 01:21:41.666
Young man.

01:21:52.916 --> 01:21:54.791
Go get 'em, fella.

01:21:57.958 --> 01:22:00.291
Corny, dude. Corny.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.250
- You permanent or contract?
- I'm a singer.

01:22:07.416 --> 01:22:10.539

01:22:10.541 --> 01:22:13.416
Data processing assistant,
