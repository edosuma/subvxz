WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.103
Matt's mom just died.

00:02.170 --> 00:04.705
Take whatever time you need.

00:04.772 --> 00:07.908
Owen Quine.
He's a very famous novelist.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.911
- He's helping us find daddy.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.280
I want daddy.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.748
The hero dies in exactly

00:14.815 --> 00:16.050
the same way Quine did.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.052
It must be the grimmest part
of the book

00:18.119 --> 00:20.054
and someone made him
re-enact it.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.457
- I fired Owen.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.694
I am confident
that "Bombyx Mori"

00:26.760 --> 00:27.995
is not the work of one person.

00:28.062 --> 00:30.198
What does Quine allege
about you both?

00:30.264 --> 00:32.133
In Andrew's case

00:32.200 --> 00:35.336
he implies that Andrew himself

00:35.403 --> 00:38.772
wrote a nasty parody
of his late wife's novel.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.776
We've got a suspect as well.
The wife.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.778
I'll be home soon, Dodo.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.415
I promise.

00:52.986 --> 00:56.224
* You and me *

00:56.290 --> 00:59.026
* Me and you *

00:59.093 --> 01:03.831
* Somehow we make it through *

01:05.366 --> 01:08.102
* I may be gone *

01:08.169 --> 01:11.939
* I may be far away *

01:12.005 --> 01:15.476
* But I'll walk beside you *

01:15.543 --> 01:19.480
* Every step of the way *

01:19.547 --> 01:23.884
* When you're used bruised *

01:23.951 --> 01:26.254
* Black and blue *

01:26.320 --> 01:30.891
* Don't think about it *

01:30.958 --> 01:33.861
* Never doubt it *

01:33.927 --> 01:37.365
* I'll walk beside you **

01:39.500 --> 01:42.803
'Love is a, um..'

01:42.870 --> 01:45.239
'...it's a mirage, it's a..'

01:45.306 --> 01:46.707
'...it's a delusion.'

01:46.774 --> 01:48.442
'For all your protest, Andrew'

01:48.509 --> 01:50.944
I thought your depiction
of this relationship

01:51.011 --> 01:52.813
was full of love.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.515
And brave, too

01:54.582 --> 01:57.017
given your proximity
to the subject matter.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.587
You're referring to the suicide
of my first wife.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.256
Yes.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.394
So, let me say this, um..

02:06.460 --> 02:07.761
Um..

02:10.864 --> 02:13.901
When Effigy died, um..

02:16.904 --> 02:19.407
'I mean, when Ellie died..'

02:37.191 --> 02:39.159
'It's me. Are you awake?'

02:39.227 --> 02:40.561
I take it
you caught the train?

02:40.628 --> 02:42.930
Yeah, and thanks
for letting me stay longer.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.665
Matt needs me. But listen.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.667
I've just seen a program
with Andrew Fancourt.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.035
And when he's asked
about his first wife

02:48.101 --> 02:50.471
I swear he calls her Effigy.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.383
Effigy.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.918
Read your words aloud.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.186
Okay.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.521
"Her love for him was like that

03:07.588 --> 03:10.190
of a pertinacious gudgeon.."

03:10.258 --> 03:12.560
Oh, no. The words are no good.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.363
We must give her new words.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.458
I think Leonora Quine
is innocent.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.227
I bet my remaining leg on it.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.397
That's all I've got.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.458
Hello, Leonora.
This is Ilsa Herbert.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.993
'She'll represent you.'

04:20.060 --> 04:23.230
'We have limited time,
so provided you'll feel able..'

04:23.297 --> 04:24.898
When can I go?

04:26.367 --> 04:30.037
We do need to get through
some questions.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.705
Did anyone have keys

04:31.772 --> 04:33.941
for the house in Talgarth Road?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.476
Andrew Fancourt.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.945
We had spares cut when
there was repairs on the roof

04:38.011 --> 04:39.212
but I can't find 'em.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.449
Did anyone else
ever handle the keys

04:41.515 --> 04:43.050
even just for a day?

04:43.116 --> 04:44.885
It got rented out sometimes.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.655
So, I suppose there's people
who've been through there.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.858
That house has been a nightmare.
We cannot sell it.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.527
And Andrew made sure
nobody can make money off it

04:53.594 --> 04:55.529
just 'cause of him
not likin' Owen.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.965
In the end, Owen said
better to forget about it.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.069
Can we talk
about the credit card?

05:02.135 --> 05:05.673
Oh, I told him I don't know
anything about any of that.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.009
A burqa, ropes, and overalls
all bought six months ago

05:09.076 --> 05:12.212
on your family credit card
and delivered to the house

05:12.279 --> 05:13.981
on Talgarth Road.

05:16.784 --> 05:20.421
Is there a scenario
where your husband

05:20.488 --> 05:22.956
might have bought
these things for himself?

05:25.593 --> 05:27.595
I don't know. Um..

05:27.661 --> 05:29.296
The ropes, maybe?

05:29.363 --> 05:30.998
He liked being tied up.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.635
He just told me
what to pay off, and I did.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.638
I never went over things
with him.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.941
Did Owen ever discuss
"Bombyx Mori" with you?

05:41.008 --> 05:44.244
He said it was gonna be a book
about how a silkworm

05:44.311 --> 05:47.881
gets boiled alive like he has
been by the critics. That's it.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.883
Hm.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.085
Prosecution will..

05:52.152 --> 05:54.187
...use that as evidence
that you were aware

05:54.254 --> 05:55.989
of elements in the manuscript.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.528
How does this help him?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.363
Ilsa's just doing her job.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.566
I answered all these questions
already though.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.367
'The police have
a different agenda.'

06:07.435 --> 06:08.702
I'm asking you these questions

06:08.769 --> 06:10.471
to try to keep you
out of prison.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.840
Well, I didn't do anything.
That's enough, innit?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.742
The ugly truth is
it might not be.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.010
What does she mean, "It might
not be

06:17.077 --> 06:19.146
- Look, we need--
- You shut up.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.115
I know him. I don't know you.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.018
You were supposed to keep me
out of here, you promised.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.554
Ilsa's a friend.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.622
She's good at her job.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.158
I trust her.
You need to trust her too.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.261
I know you're frustrated.
I know you're scared.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.530
But we're on your side.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.969
I just want my Dodo.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.867
Robin's phone, Matt speaking.
Can I take a message?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.640
Sorry, did you say mud?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.919
You okay?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.591
You got a call about extra
cleaning for a car you hired.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.094
- Oh, uh--

07:42.596 --> 07:45.198
I, uh, had to drive
a hired car last week.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.000
- Uh..

07:49.236 --> 07:51.271
Down to Devon.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.642
We had to interview a suspect
and Cormoran can't drive, so..

07:54.708 --> 07:58.411
So that's why you couldn't help
arrange my mum's funeral.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.480
You were being his taxi.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.485
No, I..

08:18.131 --> 08:19.833
It looks bad.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.236
Access, motive,
this credit card thing.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.739
The way she talks to the police.
She's her own worst enemy.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.842
All the credit card proves
is that she's being framed.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.715
Corm, everything alright?

08:41.789 --> 08:44.925
It's fine. Just Charlotte.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.929
No relapsing.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.165
Yeah, Nick was clear
about that as well.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.701
Oh, I'm fine.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.748
I need to talk to you.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.150
Is it more headlines about me
locking up the wrong person?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.184
That wasn't very helpful.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.853
The headlines
I've just read says

09:12.920 --> 09:15.322
"Wife accused of murder.
Trained as butcher."

09:15.388 --> 09:16.857
She's being framed, Rich.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.026
Just ask yourself, are you
saying she's clever enough

09:19.092 --> 09:21.294
to put together
this complicated murder

09:21.361 --> 09:23.130
leaving nothing for forensics?

09:23.196 --> 09:25.866
No useful witnesses,
no credible leads, nothing

09:25.933 --> 09:27.868
but also stupid enough

09:27.935 --> 09:30.137
to put her disguise
on the credit card?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.339
Bob, I like you as a man

09:32.405 --> 09:34.775
and I owe you my life,
and that goes a long way.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.711
But on this one,
you're just plain wrong, mate.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.914
Andrew Fancourt had a key
to the property.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.683
Andrew Fancourt hated Quine

09:42.750 --> 09:44.652
long before
this manuscript came out.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.821
Why aren't you knocking
on his door?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.691
I'm gonna chalk this up to you
having a bad day, Bob.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.221
I thought you were meant to be
at the British Library.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.757
I was, but..

10:23.824 --> 10:26.994
...plans changed, and then,
the seats on the early--

10:27.060 --> 10:29.697
Worst case scenario would be
two hours standing up.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.099
I stood all the time
coming to visit you.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.335
I'd sit in the gangway..

10:37.004 --> 10:39.439
...because it was you.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.242
Because you were in
a shitty place and I loved ya.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.643
I know.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.249
I should have come sooner--

10:49.316 --> 10:50.383
'I don't want your boss'

10:50.450 --> 10:53.153
anywhere near our wedding.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.822
If he can't even let you off
for a day or two

10:54.888 --> 10:56.556
when my mum dies,
what kind of a man is he?

10:56.623 --> 10:58.425
Matt, uh..

11:03.463 --> 11:05.766
This wasn't Cormoran's fault.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.235
Yeah.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.975
'It was my decision to stay.'

11:22.783 --> 11:24.117
I've wanted to be
an investigator

11:24.184 --> 11:26.053
'for as long as I can remember.'

11:26.119 --> 11:29.689
It's the whole reason I studied
psychology in the first place.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.392
And then..

11:34.027 --> 11:37.097
...for years, I've felt like
that had been taken away.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.002
But now I've got a chance.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.404
'I know you don't like it.'

11:44.471 --> 11:45.806
And, I..

11:47.274 --> 11:49.176
...I think
that's why I lied to you.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.478
And I am sorry.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.281
I am so sorry

11:54.347 --> 11:57.184
'cause I should have
been here for you.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.451
But..

12:04.691 --> 12:06.827
I don't wanna lose this.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.435
Of course,
I want you to be happy.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.479
I am so, so sorry
I wasn't here sooner.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.152
Let's just settle
and say it couldn't be helped.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.130
When you going back?

12:46.399 --> 12:50.270
So, how was your case?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.808
I don't know.
Ilsa, how was my case?

12:54.875 --> 12:57.344
Well, if you're trying
to keep her out of prison

12:57.410 --> 12:59.179
pretty terrible.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.350
- No.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.717
Sweet kid.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.653
Not really built for this world.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.721
'And I think the neighbor's
struggling with her.'

13:08.788 --> 13:11.158
Aren't social services
involved yet?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.669
- It's Sunday.
- I know.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.006
I think we should start
taking a closer look

13:59.072 --> 14:02.242
at Andrew Fancourt, don't you?

14:02.309 --> 14:03.810
Well, I've haven't come in
on the weekend

14:03.877 --> 14:05.946
to pay the utility bills.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.181
I've got his address.
Let's go.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.452
Britain's most
celebrated novelist

14:12.519 --> 14:15.322
stripping out of a burka
on a London side street.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.757
He could have just worn it
to get off Talgarth Road

14:17.824 --> 14:19.526
then changed in the car
or something.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.494
- Let's take a look in there.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.964
See if he could've buried
the guts around the back.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.874
Do you want
to give me a leg up?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.077
- No, no, no. I'll be alright.
- Okay.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.017
Well, he's not burying
anything in here.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.288
Shit.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.223
- Shit.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.493
Fuck it,
this one burns. Christ.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.095
I'm fine.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.630
- Here. Lean on me.
- No, no, I'm fine.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.033
Well, you're obviously not. Just
put your weight on my shoulder.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.235
There's a pub around the corner.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.872
- Bribery.
- Motivation.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.141
I'm sorry, Robin.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.842
You didn't need this.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.712
To saving your stump.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.569
The amount of stuff
you're meant to do

15:36.636 --> 15:37.937
to keep it healthy..

15:38.005 --> 15:40.573
Powders and creams and baths.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.144
Happy birthday.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.180
- Well.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.217
I know your passport number
by heart as well.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.987
Many happy returns,
Mr. Cormoran Blue Strike.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.059
Are you gonna tell me
where that's from?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.660
- Nope.
- 'Mm.'

16:04.131 --> 16:05.965
I got you something.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.273
It's billed as the taste
of Cornwall.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.508
But you can be the judge
of that.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.885
I grew up two miles
from where this is made.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.221
- It's good.
- Good.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.025
Robin, this is..

16:33.560 --> 16:36.096
I like it.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.165
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.174
"Made with Cornish cow's milk."

16:47.240 --> 16:50.277
Mm, eating nothing
but Cornish grass

16:50.343 --> 16:52.079
and looking at Cornwall.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.417
This is exactly what the whole
of Cornwall tastes like.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.290
Fancourt lives near Hampstead
Heath. It's a cruising ground.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.824
Easy for him to go
in the wood at night

17:04.891 --> 17:06.159
without raisin' suspicion.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.794
He could've buried
the guts in there.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.028
Have the police
checked him over?

17:09.096 --> 17:11.798
They won't.
They've got Leonora.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.534
But Fancourt's in "Bombyx Mori."
You'd have thought that--

17:14.601 --> 17:17.036
I'm not sure the Met's
Literary Criticism Unit

17:17.104 --> 17:19.439
was brought in on this one.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.175
I mean, he's certainly got
the imagination for it.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.545
Lots of the profile pieces
you read on him

17:25.612 --> 17:27.547
talk about
how he writes violence.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.284
I'd like to find
Fancourt tomorrow.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.054
Will your leg be alright
for that?

17:35.122 --> 17:37.056
Yeah, it'd be fine.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.373
- My morning's free after all.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.846
I could tail Fancourt.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.514
You haven't been trained.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.015
I want to do it.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.851
I'll be careful.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.620
And Liz Tassel's agreed
to talk to you about Fancourt.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.257
It'll be a lunch,
so you'll be sitting down.

18:31.578 --> 18:35.081
- No, just a water for me.
- Certainly.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.816
How's Leonora?

18:38.351 --> 18:40.953
- Well, she's been arrested.
- Yes.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.789
So, as you'd expect.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.726
Orlando is half the reason
I kept Owen on.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.496
I hope she'll be looked after.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.464
I don't think they have
any other family.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.600
Yes, well, she won't
be left to starve.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.336
Fortunately, this is England.
We're still halfway civilized.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.106
The Quines barely have anything.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.641
Ah.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.545
I've had to give them a lot
of help over the years.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.452
Can we talk
about Andrew Fancourt?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.319
Why?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.521
I gather he and Quine fell out.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.490
Oh, that was a long time ago.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.692
You were all friends
together once.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.726
Is that right?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.428
I represented them both.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.829
Must've been quite a coup
to have

19:56.896 --> 19:58.164
Andrew Fancourt as a client.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.300
Well, he hadn't won
any major prizes

20:00.367 --> 20:02.669
when I took him on.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.437
We were friends.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.139
Back then, we both wrote,
but of course

20:07.206 --> 20:09.642
he became Andrew Fancourt
and I stopped.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.481
Andrew called my efforts..

20:14.547 --> 20:16.849
...lamentably derivative.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.620
No doubt, correctly.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.458
Why did he leave your agency?

20:25.525 --> 20:28.194
Because Owen wrote a parody
of his wife's novel

20:28.261 --> 20:29.729
and I refused to sack him
over it.

20:29.796 --> 20:33.666
I abhor censorship
and I dislike being threatened.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.868
Andrew forced me to choose
and so I did.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.570
Oh.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.640
But after Fancourt's wife
killed herself

20:40.707 --> 20:42.309
over that parody, didn't you..

20:42.375 --> 20:44.977
Anyone who kills herself
over a little criticism

20:45.044 --> 20:47.314
has no business writing.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.248
Do you know how,
do you know how many people

20:49.316 --> 20:51.050
think they can write?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.619
Mountains of dreck

20:52.685 --> 20:55.254
and billions of wasted hours.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.624
Ellie Fancourt had..

20:59.058 --> 21:02.562
Or Andrew at least should have
read the work and stopped it.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.031
Roper only published it
as a sop to Andrew.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.799
Did her no favors.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.336
Andrew and I

21:09.402 --> 21:12.204
haven't had a relationship
for a very long time.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.471
His parody
of Ellie Fancourt's novel

23:24.537 --> 23:26.172
why did Quine write it?

23:28.207 --> 23:29.742
You're asking the wrong person.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.511
But if he and Fancourt
were friends..

23:31.578 --> 23:34.313
Mm, they were never
really friends.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.149
Andrew tolerated Owen.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.452
He was an amusing dirty joke.

23:39.519 --> 23:42.088
Did Owen dislike Andrew?

23:42.154 --> 23:43.756
Envied him, probably.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.060
Did you ever regret
choosing to keep Quine on

23:48.127 --> 23:49.195
instead of Fancourt?

23:49.261 --> 23:52.398
- Given that Fancourt--
- I never regretted it.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.834
I regret that Andrew
forced me to choose.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.871
I'll gather you were
once in love with him.

24:05.144 --> 24:08.615
You seem to have very thoroughly
raked over all our lives.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.752
Is there anything
you actually want to ask me?

24:14.186 --> 24:15.287
Or have you asked me here

24:15.354 --> 24:16.889
to watch me suffer
over old memories?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.357
Well, I'm sorry.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.693
Well, what is the point
in asking me that?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.897
I have been..

24:24.964 --> 24:28.400
I have been disappointed
many times.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.070
By Andrew, by others.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.006
I live alone with a dog
who is on his last legs.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.209
What are you actually gaining
by pointing out

24:37.276 --> 24:38.244
these failings of mine?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.646
I'm sorry if I--

24:39.712 --> 24:41.614
No, no, no. Rubbish.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.585
I had at least taken comfort

24:45.652 --> 24:47.620
in building a business..

24:49.355 --> 24:51.290
...but Quine
has damaged that too.

24:51.357 --> 24:52.959
I have..

24:53.025 --> 24:54.493
I have had it.

24:58.565 --> 25:01.133
I don't deserve this.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.570
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.905
I promise you,
I'm only trying to help Leonora.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.974
You ask too much of people.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.810
You are cruel.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.633
So, this is the parody
that Quine wrote

25:33.700 --> 25:36.268
of Ellie Fancourt's novel.

25:36.335 --> 25:39.205
It was taped to her grave.
Somebody's taunting him.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.742
Or blackmailing him if they've
got proof Fancourt killed Quine.

25:42.809 --> 25:43.976
That's bloody good work, Robin.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.578
'Oh, it-it wasn't, really.'

25:45.645 --> 25:47.113
I messed up loads,
I lost track of him

25:47.179 --> 25:48.915
and then he walked
right past me.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.817
Well, some training will help.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.202
- 'I'm in here.'

26:16.575 --> 26:18.110
Just finishin' up.

26:20.613 --> 26:21.981
Wow.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.085
Thanks.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.120
Have you ever tried
to iron a dress?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.691
There's no right angles.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.660
Well, that's the problem
with breasts for you.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.168
This is excellent work.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.336
You know, I'd forgotten
how it's sort of

26:44.403 --> 26:46.138
sort of calmin'.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.221
Do you want to a box set later?

27:04.323 --> 27:06.826
Actually, I've got to work.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.295
There's someone we need
to speak to tonight

27:09.361 --> 27:11.163
it's our only opportunity.

27:11.230 --> 27:14.834
Sorry, if I'd have known
you were coming back, I'd..

27:14.901 --> 27:18.370
...I'd have tried
to get out of it.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.339
Can we do it tomorrow?

27:21.607 --> 27:23.009
No problem.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.288
We're guests of Daniel Chard.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.290
Cormoran Strike plus one.

27:40.526 --> 27:43.095
Yeah. Go ahead.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.764
Plus one.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.066
He's not keen on me, is he?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.881
They moan about
declining book sales.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.682
Everyone I've met so far
in publishing

28:03.750 --> 28:04.884
either has a drink
in their hand

28:04.951 --> 28:06.753
or will only meet for lunch.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.456
Hmm. It's not a bad life, is it?

28:31.443 --> 28:34.146
- Oh, he's back already.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.651
A party where I can smoke.

28:46.592 --> 28:47.794
Oh, thank you.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.362
I should've brought a cardi.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.679
During a period of..

29:07.746 --> 29:11.450
...rapid change
in the world of publishing

29:11.517 --> 29:14.420
one fact remains..

29:14.486 --> 29:16.622
...indisputably true.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.925
Work with great writers

29:18.991 --> 29:21.660
and your readers will come.

29:21.727 --> 29:22.995
- Hm, that's right.
- Yeah.

29:23.062 --> 29:26.065
In that vein, tonight

29:26.132 --> 29:29.201
I am delighted
to announce that..

29:29.268 --> 29:32.571
...perhaps the most garlanded
novelist in England

29:32.638 --> 29:36.408
is returning to Roper Chard
after 20 years.

29:38.144 --> 29:41.413
Ladies and gentlemen,
Andrew Fancourt.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.751
- The man himself.
- 'Thanks, Dan.'

29:45.818 --> 29:48.020
Thanks, everyone, uh..

29:48.087 --> 29:50.089
It's good to be back.
It feels like a homecoming.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.924
Um..

29:51.991 --> 29:53.826
I wrote for Chard.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.361
And then, I wrote for Roper.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.566
They were good days.
I was an angry young man.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.234
Now, I'm an angry old man.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.441
I look forward
to raging for you.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.152
- Mm.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.075
I see you're struggling
to choose a drink.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.579
I can tell you the champagne
won't kill you. I picked it out.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.151
Well, that's
what I'll have, then.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.988
Champagne, twice.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.062
Now, I'm gonna ask you, perhaps
the most provocative question

31:03.129 --> 31:05.264
you can be asked
at one of these things.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.334
Read anything good lately?

31:10.269 --> 31:13.472
Well, actually the last thing
I read, if I'm honest..

31:14.773 --> 31:16.142
...was "Bombyx Mori."

31:16.208 --> 31:17.944
- 'There you go.'
- Thanks.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.080
Owen Quine returns
to his true metier

31:21.147 --> 31:23.482
the poison pen letter.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.886
What did you think
of my depiction?

31:29.655 --> 31:31.790
Have you read it?

31:31.857 --> 31:33.525
I've been told about it.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.698
Owen was a very minor writer

31:39.765 --> 31:41.900
with a very large ego.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.105
This conversation
would have pleased him..

31:48.074 --> 31:49.241
...enormously.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.913
Can I introduce you to someone?

31:54.981 --> 31:56.315
Sure.

32:10.596 --> 32:14.066
Cormoran Strike,
this is Andrew Fancourt.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.973
The one-legged detective.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.874
'I've read about you,
Mr. Strike.'

32:22.941 --> 32:24.710
I've been looking
into Owen Quine's death.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.645
I was hoping
we'd have a chance to talk.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.514
Well..

32:28.580 --> 32:30.449
Here we are.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.619
And may I commend you
on your choice of bait.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.655
Consider me utterly reeled in.

32:38.357 --> 32:41.960
Being a co-owner, you must have
run into Quine at Talgarth Road.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.429
I haven't been there
in ten years.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.298
'You inherited it
from your friend, Joe North.'

32:47.166 --> 32:48.834
Losing a-a friend and your wife

32:48.900 --> 32:50.136
in the same year,
that must have hurt.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.871
I didn't lose my wife,
I tripped over her body

32:52.938 --> 32:54.606
in the dark of our kitchen.

32:56.942 --> 33:00.312
Did you ever confront Quine
about the parody he wrote?

33:00.379 --> 33:02.914
- No.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.917
- I am, yes.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.254
You're gonna spare
one of those?

33:12.058 --> 33:14.660
I gather your ex-fiancee

33:14.726 --> 33:16.595
is about to get married.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.964
You pop up as a footnote

33:19.031 --> 33:20.932
in articles about her.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.568
That's high praise.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.405
Tell me.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.241
'Are you attracted
to troubled women'

33:29.308 --> 33:32.111
or do they become troubled
because of you?

33:34.213 --> 33:35.314
Perhaps, I should ask you.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.084
Oh, we just work together.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.588
Why would Quine
use "Bombyx" to deny

33:42.654 --> 33:44.590
he wrote the parody
of your wife's work?

33:44.656 --> 33:46.692
That was 30 years ago.
Surely the damage is done.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.128
Ellie thought
that if she married a writer

33:49.195 --> 33:51.029
it would change the way

33:51.097 --> 33:53.632
the world saw her.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.768
When that failed, she tried
being a writer herself.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.037
Now, Quine saw himself

33:59.105 --> 34:01.273
reflected in her.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.543
Most writers aren't
very imaginative, Mr. Strike.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.280
They end up writing
about themselves.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.816
'Quine, like Ellie,
was a failed writer'

34:10.882 --> 34:14.953
struggling to gain
some status through writing

34:15.020 --> 34:17.223
by preying in my shadow.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.792
Take care, Mr. Strike.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.732
Ms. Bait.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.668
Hi. Hi.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.739
- Robin.
- Hi. Come in, come in.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.308
Uh, there you go.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.415
There.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.751
So..

35:19.818 --> 35:22.754
Yes, do, uh, have a seat.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.690
Um, do you want coffee?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.825
- I'm alright, thanks.
- Alright.

35:28.494 --> 35:31.997
- Thank you for seeing us.
- Oh, yeah. Anything for Owen.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.366
Bastard.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.737
Tried to catch you
at the Roper Chard party

35:38.804 --> 35:41.707
but you disappeared
after Fancourt's speech.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.141
Yes.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.481
What do you think
of Andrew Fancourt?

35:49.548 --> 35:51.717
- Yes.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.820
Oh, terrific writer.
Absolute shit of a human being.

35:56.422 --> 35:59.325
"
- Yeah, we both have.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.792
But you-you've spoken
to people about it.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.495
You know what it all means
and so on.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.163
I didn't recognize you in it.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.998
Oh, I'm the Cutter.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.067
- An editor, you see.
- Oh.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.536
Uh, for my cameo

36:10.602 --> 36:13.205
Quine dusted down the old rumor

36:13.272 --> 36:16.675
that Fancourt
had fathered my daughter.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.076
Cheers, Owen.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.145
'Rest in peace, old boy.'

36:20.212 --> 36:22.748
It must've hurt,
what he said about you.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.553
Well, if you want lifelong
camaraderie, you join the army.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.855
If you want peers
who'll glory in your failure

36:29.921 --> 36:31.857
work with novelists.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.459
'No loyalty.'

36:36.262 --> 36:38.464
And of course it hurt me.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.200
Well, anyway

36:42.268 --> 36:43.802
I'm gonna have a drink.

36:43.869 --> 36:47.306
Um, precious little to be
sober for this afternoon.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.140
You'll join me?

36:49.207 --> 36:52.278
- Oh, I think a Barolo.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.680
- Sounds great.
- Good man.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.583
Bit early, isn't it?

36:57.649 --> 37:00.252
It will help him feel
we're on his side.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.255
And I like Barolo.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.734
I was talking
to Liz Tassel yesterday.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.068
I hope you met her
on a good day.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.203
She can be an utter bitch.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.376
Uh, uh.

37:24.443 --> 37:28.880
Here's to new-found candor.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.318
There.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.090
Mm.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.360
Uh, Liz made a pass at Andrew

37:41.427 --> 37:43.194
after Ellie died.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.896
'And Andrew told me at the time'

37:44.963 --> 37:46.932
'that he saw it
as a badge of honor'

37:46.998 --> 37:50.068
that, um, he couldn't
get it up for her.

37:50.135 --> 37:52.003
Prick.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.205
Funnily enough,
she didn't tell me that story.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.707
No, I don't imagine she did.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.646
Hmm, anyway, injured pride

38:00.712 --> 38:04.383
is absolutely why she went
with Quine over Andrew.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.588
Do you think Fancourt
had a motive to kill Quine?

38:09.655 --> 38:12.991
Well, obviously,
there's the book's claim

38:13.058 --> 38:16.828
that Fancourt wrote the parody
of his wife himself.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.296
Could that be true?

38:18.364 --> 38:20.899
Could Fancourt..

38:20.966 --> 38:22.768
...kill a man?

38:25.704 --> 38:28.840
Well, he's very good
at writing hate.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.110
There's a kind of viciousness
that comes from somewhere

38:32.177 --> 38:33.645
even if it's disguised.

38:33.712 --> 38:36.014
See, a writer gives himself
away like that

38:36.081 --> 38:39.651
invariably puts himself into
the text more than he knows.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.621
Daniel Chard had an interesting
theory about that with "Bombyx."

38:42.688 --> 38:45.056
Well, Daniel certainly
didn't like what Quine

38:45.123 --> 38:46.692
said about him.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.494
He thinks the manuscript
could have had

38:48.560 --> 38:50.362
more than one contributor.

38:53.732 --> 38:57.335
Well, that's rather
an interesting thought.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.113
There we are.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.517
'There are lots of parts
that feel like classic Quine'

39:11.583 --> 39:12.784
more shock-horror stuff.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.388
But there are other parts
where..

39:17.789 --> 39:19.491
Now..

39:19.558 --> 39:22.728
I've edited his stuff
for 20 odd years

39:22.794 --> 39:26.465
and I never once saw him
use a semicolon.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.770
And in that manuscript,
there are several.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.872
Now, that is not
the kind of thing

39:33.939 --> 39:37.008
a writer embraces
late in his career.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.414
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.488
Thank you.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.490
Alright, I'm off to Fulham.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.328
'Sorry about before.'

39:57.395 --> 39:59.531
If I'd known he was dead, I..

40:00.999 --> 40:02.601
That's okay.

40:03.935 --> 40:07.138
I remember you said
something about..

40:07.205 --> 40:10.909
He told you he was gonna
put you in his next book.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.178
It seemed to me like
you were expecting to read

40:13.244 --> 40:16.214
a very different manuscript.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.616
He loved me.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.084
He told he wanted to be with me

40:19.150 --> 40:21.119
and work with me.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.288
And then..

40:23.354 --> 40:24.856
And I'm a writer as well

40:24.923 --> 40:26.825
so this was a big deal for me.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.661
He told me he was writing
a book with me in it.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.665
And then I read it

40:33.732 --> 40:35.501
and he calls me Harpy.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.669
Makes jokes
about my sister's cancer.

40:37.736 --> 40:40.672
Just staggeringly,
staggeringly painful.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.408
- He always said he loved me.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.143
And he said by
me bein' in his book

40:45.210 --> 40:46.712
we'd be together.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.916
I burned it.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.654
Never trust a novelist.

40:55.721 --> 40:58.690
I should have that
tattooed on my arm.

40:58.757 --> 41:02.193
I loved him
and he just humiliated me.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.595
Look, it fits, or rather

41:03.662 --> 41:05.997
there's so many other pieces
that don't quite fit.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.600
It might be the only thing
that explains it.

41:08.667 --> 41:09.968
First of all, the title.

41:10.035 --> 41:13.605
Leonora says Quine told her
silkworms are boiled.

41:13.672 --> 41:16.074
The silkworm in "Bombyx"
is cut open.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.843
But then, there's the fact
that the book features

41:17.909 --> 41:19.945
its hero burned by a liquid.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.447
And the site just happens to be
filled with hydrochloric acid

41:22.514 --> 41:24.482
and that's a neat coincidence.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.885
Kathryn Kent was expecting
a very different book.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.987
Jerry Waldegrave
and Daniel Chard

41:29.054 --> 41:31.156
both detected foreign influence
in the text.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.224
We keep hearing different
versions of the same thing.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.594
Something is not quite right
with "Bombyx Mori."

41:35.661 --> 41:37.963
So, we need a literary analyst.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.731
Someone who can compare
writing styles.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.232
Yeah, I could get on that.

41:41.299 --> 41:43.835
And there might also be
something else of Quine's.

41:43.902 --> 41:47.305
Um, what will you do?

41:47.372 --> 41:49.007
There's only one instance
we know of

41:49.074 --> 41:51.509
where Quine discussed
the manuscript with somebody.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.912
The lunch with Liz Tassel
where she fired him.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.615
Are you going for lunch again?

41:56.682 --> 41:57.916
Needs must.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.656
Good of you to do this, Al.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.291
I get to hang out
with my brother

42:06.357 --> 42:07.659
in my favorite restaurant.

42:07.726 --> 42:08.927
What's not to like?

42:08.994 --> 42:12.230
Dad is still hoping
you'll meet up with him.

42:12.297 --> 42:13.765
How are ya?

42:13.832 --> 42:17.569
Uh, media bollocks,
sexy girlfriend..

42:17.636 --> 42:19.771
Can't complain.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.472
Look, you know people here,
don't you?

42:21.539 --> 42:22.741
Yeah, I come here a lot.

42:22.808 --> 42:24.409
I need to talk to anyone
who might have seen

42:24.475 --> 42:26.878
an argument in here.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.614
Uh..

42:28.680 --> 42:30.281
Well, Frankie's on.
She knows everyone.

42:30.348 --> 42:33.551
Mate. Could you ask Frankie
to come over and have a word?

42:33.619 --> 42:34.986
Thank you.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.759
How are the rest
of the siblings?

42:40.826 --> 42:43.194
Oh, the Rokeby diaspora.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.931
Yeah, no, they're good.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.166
Dad got inducted into
the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame.

42:48.233 --> 42:51.637
- No. Passed me by.

42:51.703 --> 42:52.971
Yeah, you look around and, uh..

42:53.038 --> 42:55.974
Well, these guys are getting
really old now.

42:56.041 --> 42:58.610
Hall of DJs won't have
the same vibe, will it?

43:15.393 --> 43:17.228
Hi, I work with Cormoran Strike.

43:17.295 --> 43:20.666
Is it alright if I come in
and have a look around?

43:20.732 --> 43:22.968
I could use a break,
if I'm honest.

43:23.034 --> 43:25.704
Orlando's upstairs.
I'll go and fetch her.

43:25.771 --> 43:27.739
- I'm Robin.
- 'Hi.'

43:27.806 --> 43:29.741
Nice to meet you.

44:06.511 --> 44:08.179
- Hey, Al.
- Oh, Frankie.

44:08.246 --> 44:10.816
- This is my brother, Cormoran.
- Hi.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.317
'Uh, can you spare
five minutes?'

44:12.383 --> 44:14.986
It'll have to be
a very quick five.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.855
Apparently, these two
had a round here

44:16.922 --> 44:18.724
'over a fortnight ago.'

44:18.790 --> 44:21.292
Oh, yeah, police asked us
about this already.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.028
'Last known sighting,
wasn't it?'

44:23.094 --> 44:24.629
- 'Oh, my God.'

44:24.696 --> 44:26.264
They were ridiculous.

44:26.331 --> 44:27.365
At one point, he stood up

44:27.432 --> 44:30.368
literally pointed his finger
at her and shouted

44:30.435 --> 44:33.638
"The world shall know
you made Fancourt's dick limp."

44:35.874 --> 44:37.843
I can see why you wouldn't
forget that, yeah.

44:37.909 --> 44:39.978
Did it seem like
they were putting it on?

44:40.045 --> 44:43.348
Oh, he was hammin' it up,
enjoying being a massive prick.

44:43.414 --> 44:45.383
She looked properly angry

44:45.450 --> 44:47.886
'by telling him to sit down
and shut up.'

44:47.953 --> 44:50.388
'Walked out on her.'

44:50.455 --> 44:52.190
So, he was acting?

44:52.257 --> 44:54.793
Look, I've got to get back.
Is that okay?

44:54.860 --> 44:57.763
- We will tip heavily.
- Thanks, sweetie.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.934
I never get called sweetie
by waitresses.

45:03.001 --> 45:06.071
Well, that's because you're, uh,
not tipping heavily enough.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.188
Do you have a dog?

45:23.254 --> 45:24.655
Uh, yes.

45:24.722 --> 45:26.892
Well, well, my family does.

45:26.958 --> 45:28.827
His name's Rowntree.

45:30.161 --> 45:32.163
I want a dog.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.733
- I just want a dog.

45:38.970 --> 45:41.139
What's your name?

45:41.206 --> 45:43.809
Robin.

45:43.875 --> 45:47.012
I'm Dodo. I'm a bird.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.948
- Robins are birds.
- Yeah.

45:51.116 --> 45:52.984
Can I draw you one?

45:57.155 --> 45:58.323
Alright.

46:18.176 --> 46:19.344
Hm.

46:21.146 --> 46:22.113
And..

46:23.348 --> 46:25.016
There you go.

46:30.488 --> 46:31.990
What else is in there?

46:32.057 --> 46:34.492
I can't show you the insides.

46:34.559 --> 46:37.128
That's where I put things

46:37.195 --> 46:38.596
I've stolen.

46:38.663 --> 46:40.131
Oh.

46:42.533 --> 46:46.504
If I was to give you
something of mine to steal

46:46.571 --> 46:48.539
could I have a look inside then?

46:50.741 --> 46:52.410
Oh.

46:53.678 --> 46:55.646
You've got expensive taste.

46:58.183 --> 46:59.350
Okay.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.188
Here you go.

47:14.732 --> 47:16.301
Wow.

47:37.455 --> 47:39.257
Are you stealing it?

47:41.792 --> 47:43.828
- No.

47:43.895 --> 47:45.430
You can steal it.

47:46.932 --> 47:48.900
Thanks, Orlando.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.370
Do you think
we should go outside now?

47:52.437 --> 47:53.704
No.

47:53.771 --> 47:55.907
You stay with me.

48:00.278 --> 48:03.714
Stay! Stay! Stay!

48:03.781 --> 48:05.650
I'll come and see you again,
I promise.

48:05.716 --> 48:08.353
Stay!

48:09.854 --> 48:12.390
- She's just missing her mum.

48:12.457 --> 48:14.960
We'll be alright, Dodo.
Won't we, Dodo?

48:15.026 --> 48:16.561
'Come on, my darling.
There we go.'

48:20.231 --> 48:23.168
Regular names.
Eddie Boy and Kate.

48:24.936 --> 48:27.272
There's no baroque
archetypes here.

48:37.949 --> 48:39.650
You did well to get this.

48:39.717 --> 48:41.686
Apparently, a lot of people
are scoutin' for it

48:41.752 --> 48:44.689
'cause it's got Fancourt's
earliest published story in it.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.491
How's it looking?

48:46.557 --> 48:47.892
Uh, yes, so

48:47.959 --> 48:50.061
'you see here,
in these short stories'

48:50.128 --> 48:51.963
'and here, in this parody'

48:52.030 --> 48:54.165
the same unusual formulation
of phrase.

48:54.232 --> 48:56.034
and, uh, h-here again,
in this piece.

48:56.101 --> 48:57.835
Uh, the semi-colon, uh

48:57.902 --> 48:59.937
'used more frequently
than usual.'

49:00.005 --> 49:01.906
Ah, yes. Look here.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.309
'Fancourt favors
an Oxford comma'

49:04.375 --> 49:06.544
and it's across
all three pieces.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.814
Uh, here, in Quine's novel

49:09.880 --> 49:12.150
no Oxford comma.

49:12.217 --> 49:15.720
It's the kind of thing a writer
usually is in or out on.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.855
Is it proof?

49:17.922 --> 49:19.124
No.

49:19.190 --> 49:22.293
Um, but these things,
uh, together

49:22.360 --> 49:25.396
I would bet that whoever
wrote this parody piece

49:25.463 --> 49:27.198
also wrote your "Bombyx Mori."

49:27.265 --> 49:30.268
Uh, and, uh, probably
this short story too.

49:30.335 --> 49:33.004
- Harder to say here.
- I'd bet on it as well.

49:34.339 --> 49:36.841
It's a sophisticated revenge,
isn't it?

49:36.907 --> 49:38.276
The story of your grudge

49:38.343 --> 49:41.479
in the form of a-a secret parody
of Quine himself.

49:41.546 --> 49:42.513
Hmm.

49:42.580 --> 49:45.316
A story that leaves
Quine's lover

49:45.383 --> 49:48.086
his wife and his colleagues
all hating him.

49:48.153 --> 49:50.055
It's a very comprehensive
kind of revenge.

49:50.121 --> 49:51.556
But too complicated.

49:51.622 --> 49:53.991
That's what I'm pickin'
in the end.

49:58.396 --> 50:00.698
'Anstis, last favor.'

50:00.765 --> 50:02.800
'You need to trust me on this.'

50:02.867 --> 50:06.404
'You're gonna need
to get a search warrant.'

50:14.112 --> 50:15.480
Are you sure about this?

50:15.546 --> 50:16.781
Absolutely.

50:27.325 --> 50:29.627
It's like
a "Bombyx Mori" reunion.

50:43.141 --> 50:46.077
Mr. Chard, Mr. Fancourt,
if you have a moment?

50:46.144 --> 50:48.279
It concerns "Bombyx Mori."

51:00.825 --> 51:03.728
I read the parody of your
wife's novel, Mr. Fancourt.

51:06.431 --> 51:08.633
How does it hold up?

51:08.699 --> 51:11.302
What struck me was
how spiteful it was.

51:15.340 --> 51:18.109
But what about "Bombyx?"

51:18.176 --> 51:20.678
'The two pieces were written
by the same person.'

51:22.347 --> 51:25.416
- Well, we know that.
- Owen Quine was not the author.

51:27.585 --> 51:30.788
I couldn't hear the title
of that wretched book raised

51:30.855 --> 51:34.259
and not apologize...to you both.

51:34.325 --> 51:36.327
'Good evening, Miss Tassel,
I was just telling them'

51:36.394 --> 51:39.364
that Owen Quine
didn't write "Bombyx Mori."

51:39.430 --> 51:41.699
At least not the version
I've read.

51:41.766 --> 51:44.369
'He did write a book
called "Bombyx Mori"'

51:44.435 --> 51:47.472
and he intended to settle
some scores with it.

51:47.538 --> 51:50.074
Embarrass a few old
sparring partners.

51:50.141 --> 51:51.776
But his anecdote

51:51.842 --> 51:54.445
about Mr. Fancourt's limp dick

51:54.512 --> 51:56.747
'doesn't appear
in the text we were given.'

52:00.351 --> 52:02.453
What are you talking about?

52:02.520 --> 52:05.523
You wrote the parody
of Ellie Fancourt's novel.

52:05.590 --> 52:08.326
The one she killed herself over.

52:08.393 --> 52:10.661
Owen Quine knew you wrote it.

52:13.130 --> 52:15.366
That is a disgusting slur.

52:15.433 --> 52:18.769
You wrote a short story
for an Oxford anthology.

52:18.836 --> 52:20.738
Its style is a good match

52:20.805 --> 52:24.108
with both "Bombyx Mori"

52:24.175 --> 52:27.412
and the parody
of Ellie Fancourt's book.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.248
Andrew, don't listen to this.
It is absolute rubbish.

52:30.315 --> 52:33.050
'It's all there in the book
you wrote, Ms. Tassel.'

52:33.117 --> 52:35.786
'You were hurt when Andrew
rejected your writing'

52:35.853 --> 52:38.889
'and again,
when he rejected your love.'

52:46.163 --> 52:49.567
'Owen Quine had a price
for keeping your secret.'

52:49.634 --> 52:52.637
You didn't support
that family out of pity.

52:52.703 --> 52:56.274
He blackmailed you
for nearly 30 years.

52:56.341 --> 52:59.677
He forced you to choose him
over Andrew as a client.

52:59.744 --> 53:01.479
Poor Mr. Strike.

53:01.546 --> 53:03.881
So buggered for money,
he has to scrape the barrel.

53:03.948 --> 53:06.951
'It was your idea for Quine to
make a scene in the restaurant'

53:07.017 --> 53:09.119
'and shout at you, storm out.'

53:09.186 --> 53:11.656
Then later,
he'd hole up in Talgarth Road

53:11.722 --> 53:15.025
while the press picked up on
the row in his disappearance.

53:15.092 --> 53:16.961
It had worked for him
in the past.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.763
That's rubbish.

53:18.829 --> 53:21.499
'Afterwards,
you visited Leonora's house'

53:21.566 --> 53:23.901
'to reassure her
when Quine went missing.'

53:23.968 --> 53:26.437
You took the opportunity
to remove every notebook

53:26.504 --> 53:28.873
from Quine's study
that contained scraps

53:28.939 --> 53:31.676
of the real "Bombyx Mori."

53:31.742 --> 53:34.479
But you didn't manage
to destroy every trace.

53:38.316 --> 53:41.519
I found some pages
from the real manuscript.

53:41.586 --> 53:44.522
And an original
typewriter ribbon.

53:44.589 --> 53:47.091
The police have just pulled

53:47.157 --> 53:48.626
'an electric typewriter'

53:48.693 --> 53:50.461
'the same model as Quine's'

53:50.528 --> 53:51.796
'from the millpond'

53:51.862 --> 53:55.266
at your friend,
Dorcus Pengelly's house.

53:57.335 --> 53:59.337
They'll be here imminently.

54:01.572 --> 54:04.975
The acid you used really did rip
your throat to shreds.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.259
Robin! Ah!

54:29.233 --> 54:30.200
Don't..

54:53.290 --> 54:54.725
Robin!

55:08.172 --> 55:10.107
- Yes.

55:10.174 --> 55:12.343
I'm fine. I'm fine.

55:18.883 --> 55:20.351
Yes, I'll hold.

55:35.032 --> 55:36.367
'Robin?'

55:44.742 --> 55:47.412
I think it's good news.
Call us a cab.

56:12.637 --> 56:14.839
'
- 'In prison.'

56:14.905 --> 56:17.107
'On suicide watch.'

56:19.143 --> 56:22.112
The police found your husband's
real book in her house.

56:22.179 --> 56:25.583
Daniel Chard wants to read it
with a view to publish it.

56:27.051 --> 56:29.587
This one might even sell
a few copies.

56:55.680 --> 56:56.781
Oh.

57:00.317 --> 57:01.686
Oh.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.602
Is Anstis talking to you?

57:17.668 --> 57:19.403
Has to, I've saved his life.

57:19.470 --> 57:21.606
I know him, and like most
coppers, he doesn't want to see

57:21.672 --> 57:23.808
the wrong person locked up.

57:23.874 --> 57:26.210
They checked her freezer,
by the way.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.613
- Not the guts.
- Feeding them to her dog.

57:28.679 --> 57:30.715
Oh, that's disgusting.

57:32.449 --> 57:34.785
Does Matty mind about all that?

57:34.852 --> 57:37.955
Oh, yeah, I told him
I had seen worse on him

57:38.022 --> 57:41.425
after rugby matches
and claimed gender equality.

57:41.492 --> 57:44.228
Well, I'm gonna get the tube.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.096
Oh, I, um, I..

57:46.163 --> 57:48.566
Your ex sent in some photos,
by the way.

57:48.633 --> 57:51.536
And I opened them by accident.

57:51.602 --> 57:53.738
She's not my problem anymore.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.473
Right.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

57:56.541 --> 57:58.408
- Robin.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.244
I got something for you.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.482
- Open it.

58:09.787 --> 58:11.622
"Surveillance course.

58:11.689 --> 58:13.858
You find it, I'll pay for it."

58:15.225 --> 58:17.261
Really?

58:17.327 --> 58:19.229
So, partners, yeah?

58:28.606 --> 58:32.476
* Oh yesterday's to come*

58:32.543 --> 58:36.581
* Godspeed your distant sun *

58:36.647 --> 58:39.283
* Oh yesterday's to come *

58:39.349 --> 58:43.988
* I will never ever
wish you away *

58:44.054 --> 58:47.792
* Never ever wish you away *

58:50.060 --> 58:54.832
* All of tomorrow's
shapeless and undefined *

58:54.899 --> 58:58.569
* We'll merge into one *

58:58.636 --> 59:00.705
* In a final meant *

59:00.771 --> 59:04.174
* For yesterdays to come *

59:06.476 --> 59:08.378
* All of tomorrow's *

59:08.445 --> 59:10.881

59:14.885 --> 59:16.887

59:16.954 --> 59:20.257
