WEBVTT

04:24.331 --> 04:25.432
<i>You alright, Fonse?</i>

04:25.465 --> 04:26.299
<i>Gino, grab him!</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:28.002
Here we go, I got ya.
You're alright.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.302
Let's go.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.906
Come on, I got ya.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.577
<i>So what're you thankful for,
Vince?</i>

04:36.611 --> 04:39.881
My back teeth.

04:39.914 --> 04:40.982
<i>Aww.</i>

04:41.015 --> 04:42.116
And Ralphie?

04:42.150 --> 04:46.486
I'm grateful today that Freddy
is finally back home.

04:51.726 --> 04:52.794
Salut.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.529
<i>And Berta?</i>

04:54.562 --> 04:55.530
I don't know.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.496
<i>You don't know?</i>

04:56.531 --> 04:58.933
You gotta have something
you're thankful for.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.635
You gotta come up
with something.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.502
Why?

05:01.536 --> 05:04.337
It's Thanksgiving,
that's what we do.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.339
What's Thanksgiving about?

05:06.373 --> 05:08.910
What do you mean?
What, the whole thing?

05:10.745 --> 05:13.815
Uh...

05:13.848 --> 05:15.482
Alright, you get
the short version

05:15.516 --> 05:17.718
'cause you're a short person.

05:17.752 --> 05:23.691
It all started when Nana
and your great grandpa,

05:23.724 --> 05:25.860
Gabriel, when they first came
to America.

05:25.893 --> 05:26.994
And they roamed the land

05:27.028 --> 05:31.498
for many, many, many years
searching for a new home.

05:31.532 --> 05:35.536
Back then Nana used to ride
on top of my father's back.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.007
That's how they used to get
around back then.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.946
So, after all this following,
this lookin' and searching,

05:44.979 --> 05:46.914
finally the found it.

05:46.948 --> 05:48.015
A new home.

05:48.049 --> 05:51.719
A nasty, cramped, little shoebox
with a broke window,

05:51.752 --> 05:53.754
a mattress, and three rats,

05:53.788 --> 05:55.556
on a crappy little street
in Brooklyn.

05:55.590 --> 05:56.456
Park Slope.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.892
You ever been to Park Slope?

05:57.925 --> 05:59.126
Didn't think so.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.495
So we would sit up by the broke
window with them three rats

06:02.530 --> 06:04.464
and we'd look out that window

06:04.497 --> 06:09.469
at all them other families out
there having their lavish parties

06:09.503 --> 06:12.974
and all their home-cooked pies
and their roasted turkeys

06:13.007 --> 06:15.977
and their stuffing with
topped cranberries

06:16.010 --> 06:20.447
and mountains of mashed potatoes
and gravy, all that fancy stuff.

06:20.480 --> 06:26.087
All them families out there,
except for us.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.491
Why?

06:31.525 --> 06:35.730
'Cause we was broke.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.932
We had nothing.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.740
So every-every year about
this time we get together

06:45.773 --> 06:50.878
as a family and we shove it
in Brooklyn's face.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.518
Yeah, that's Thanksgiving.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.098
I love you.

07:11.132 --> 07:13.100
What?

07:15.036 --> 07:16.938
I love you.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.009
I love you, too.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.051
You alright?

07:30.084 --> 07:32.620
Yeah.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.956
<i>Fonse!</i>

07:34.989 --> 07:36.223
Ah?

07:36.257 --> 07:38.059
You got a call.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.633
Hello?

07:50.538 --> 07:51.939
Hello?

07:53.107 --> 07:54.642
Hey.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.580
Hey.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.283
<i>Where are you?</i>

08:02.316 --> 08:03.951
Cleveland.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.587
Cleveland.

08:08.289 --> 08:10.257
Uh...

08:10.291 --> 08:12.960
I just wanted to say
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.531
<i>Dad.</i>

08:17.565 --> 08:20.101
<i>Hey,
what are you doing?</i>

08:26.107 --> 08:29.643
Yeah, I got family here.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.545
<i>Is there something
that you need?</i>

08:55.770 --> 08:57.872
You know, Fonse.

08:57.905 --> 09:02.576
What you need is a good
fuckin' mechanic.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.111
Get a nice oil change.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.679
It's not the fuckin' oil.

09:07.815 --> 09:13.320
You remember that 341A?
Remember that?

09:13.354 --> 09:16.090
Nah.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.592
Yeah, Cadillac.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.227
What Cadillac?

09:20.261 --> 09:23.064
The Cadillac, the one you down
in Wabash.

09:23.097 --> 09:25.099
It was Hammond.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.267
It was the modern one.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.334
Yeah, yeah, it was the modern
one, but it was Hammond.

09:27.368 --> 09:30.204
I can't remember was that dark
green, dark green

09:30.237 --> 09:31.605
or dark, dark green?

09:32.873 --> 09:36.177
You alright?

09:36.210 --> 09:39.647
Yeah. Dark green.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.884
You know, Fonse, the kids are
all going back up next week.

09:43.918 --> 09:47.755
And I was thinking, maybe I'd
stay down here with you and Mae.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.124
Me too.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.427
Pops?

09:53.461 --> 09:55.896
You're gonna have to give up
some stuff if you wanna stay

09:55.930 --> 09:57.798
in the house through
the next year

09:57.832 --> 10:01.001
so we figured we'd stay here
and help you sort it out.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.370
Between all your statues
and the painting collection

10:03.404 --> 10:07.708
I- I think we could bag us
at least 200, you know?

10:07.741 --> 10:10.411
<i>I mean, look,
I know this ain't easy.</i>

10:10.444 --> 10:12.179
<i>But if you don't get all this
stuff outta here soon</i>

10:12.213 --> 10:14.014
<i>and make some bread, Fonse,</i>

10:14.048 --> 10:16.383
<i>you're gonna be
completely screwed.</i>

10:19.220 --> 10:22.790
That's the truth.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.658
We're just worried about you,
Fonse.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.893
That's all.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.762
Ah! Fuck!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.855
You alright?

10:58.092 --> 10:59.727
Eh?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.196
Uncle Ralphie, can
you get a towel?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.731
Yeah, yeah.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.232
Where'd that come from?

11:05.266 --> 11:07.401
Bladder, pop.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.270
I'll bring you some fresh pants.

11:12.206 --> 11:14.275
That's what I'm fucking
talking about.

11:20.881 --> 11:21.782
<i>Make your
hot cereal</i>

11:21.815 --> 11:22.983
<i>with Quaker Oats.</i>

11:23.017 --> 11:26.387
<i>Cause Quaker Oats helps grow
the stars of the future.</i>

11:26.420 --> 11:28.022
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

11:28.055 --> 11:30.858
<i>our special Cobb Theatre

11:30.891 --> 11:34.328
<i>"The Saint Valentine's Day

11:34.361 --> 11:37.131
<i>Just off the docks by the
Chicago River in a black market</i>

<i>warehouse operated by none other

11:43.204 --> 11:45.005
<i>Here, Capone's top
lieutenants gathered</i>

11:45.039 --> 11:46.807
<i>to discuss their secret plan.</i>

11:46.840 --> 11:47.509
<i>Alright, gents.</i>

11:47.542 --> 11:49.176
<i>Looks like we got here uh...</i>

<i>Meanwhile down in the quiet

<i>Al Capone relaxes by the pool,

11:59.019 --> 11:59.787
<i>Yeah?</i>

11:59.820 --> 12:00.788
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

12:00.821 --> 12:02.923
<i>All set for this Thursday
in the morning.</i>

12:02.957 --> 12:04.091
<i>We got a nice valen...</i>

12:04.825 --> 12:07.394
<i>Hey, hey, what are you doing up?</i>

12:07.428 --> 12:09.430
<i>Enough guys, enough!</i>

14:46.220 --> 14:47.622
Mr. Fonzo?

14:49.657 --> 14:51.992
You want me to put the statues
by the house?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.128
Who the fuck are you?

14:54.161 --> 14:57.297
Rodrigo.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.635
You want me to move the statues
by the house?

15:03.003 --> 15:05.172
They're for sale.

15:05.205 --> 15:09.042
Mr. Fonzo?

15:09.076 --> 15:15.215
You lay one finger
on my Lady Atlas,

15:15.249 --> 15:16.618
I will cut your
fuckin' head off.

15:16.651 --> 15:18.686
Do you understand me?

15:18.720 --> 15:20.988
Si.

15:23.525 --> 15:25.259
Thank you.

16:00.494 --> 16:01.428
<i>Fonse!</i>

16:01.462 --> 16:02.697
Eh?

16:02.730 --> 16:05.065
I got you, pal.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.377
<i>Fonse! Enough!</i>

16:17.411 --> 16:18.580
<i>You're gonna get sick!</i>

16:18.613 --> 16:20.481
<i>Gino, get him inside!</i>

16:24.284 --> 16:25.954
Come on, come on.

16:27.488 --> 16:28.422
It's raining.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.190
Yeah, it's raining.

16:35.797 --> 16:37.364
Can you cut those?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.766
I'm going to cut it right now.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.604
It's unlocked.

16:44.471 --> 16:49.711
Seniorita, I finished moving the
statues out from the garage,

16:49.744 --> 16:52.547
come lo dices, by the house but
not by the house.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.480
Gracias, Rodrigo.

16:53.515 --> 16:56.049
Not a problem. Good night.

17:15.803 --> 17:19.206
What's he doing?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.207
His stuff.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.375
What stuff?

17:21.408 --> 17:22.577
His stuff outside.

17:22.610 --> 17:23.811
What do you mean?

17:23.845 --> 17:25.547
Moving stuff.

17:25.580 --> 17:28.382
If he touch my Lady Atlas
I'm telling you...

17:28.415 --> 17:30.752
Mary and Joseph, that piece of
shit, tacky statue

17:30.785 --> 17:32.486
is more important than
what, huh?

17:32.520 --> 17:33.555
You want to call the bank
yourself?

17:34.488 --> 17:35.757
You okay?

17:43.130 --> 17:44.498
Yeah.

17:44.532 --> 17:47.200
<i>You've got a collect
call from Cleveland.</i>

17:47.234 --> 17:49.704
Cleveland?

17:51.405 --> 17:53.206
Sure. Alright.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.108
<i>Hello?</i>

18:00.380 --> 18:01.749
<i>Who's there?</i>

18:04.719 --> 18:06.386
<i>Hello?</i>

19:16.323 --> 19:17.859
Fonse?!

19:18.726 --> 19:20.160
Oh, my god!

19:21.294 --> 19:22.597
Oh, Jesus!

19:24.231 --> 19:25.600
Oh!

19:26.601 --> 19:27.669
Come on.

19:27.702 --> 19:28.636
Swing out.

19:31.471 --> 19:35.208
What time is it in Ohio?

19:35.242 --> 19:36.544
What happened?

19:36.577 --> 19:37.745
You shit the bed,
that's what happened.

19:37.779 --> 19:39.681
- I'm calling the doctor.
- Oh, no.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.388
<i>Tell them the doctor is here!</i>

20:36.003 --> 20:39.640
A Three, two, a one.

20:39.674 --> 20:41.274
Ta-dah.

20:44.812 --> 20:47.280
Do we know what these are?

20:47.314 --> 20:48.883
Diapers?

20:50.685 --> 20:52.987
There's plenty here, as well.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.922
How's his energy been
during the day?

20:54.956 --> 20:55.890
He's awake.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.390
How's his...

21:00.661 --> 21:02.930
So we're still having
nightmares, are we?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.802
Fonse, could I have
your attention for a moment?

21:07.835 --> 21:09.704
Fonse.

21:09.737 --> 21:12.006
You know who I am?

21:18.478 --> 21:21.983
J. Edgar Hoover.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.450
Who sent this fucking guy?

21:23.483 --> 21:24.351
I did.

21:24.384 --> 21:24.952
I'm your doctor.

21:31.659 --> 21:32.894
Shh!

21:32.927 --> 21:33.861
They're just working.

21:33.895 --> 21:35.062
Sit down.

21:36.831 --> 21:38.599
<i>Stop yelling at them.
Come on.</i>

21:39.167 --> 21:42.369
I understand things are
tightening up financially.

21:42.402 --> 21:48.576
But all of these personal
artifacts just disappearing.

21:48.609 --> 21:51.579
The best thing for Fonse
has gotta be to try to keep

21:51.612 --> 21:56.083
things as familiar
for him as you all can manage.

21:56.117 --> 21:58.619
The last thing we want is
for him to...

21:58.653 --> 21:59.921
Get another stroke.

21:59.954 --> 22:00.988
Mmmhmm.

22:01.022 --> 22:03.124
He's not coughing
as much anymore.

22:03.157 --> 22:04.058
He's got his good days...

22:05.760 --> 22:07.494
Sit down!

22:08.963 --> 22:10.965
Honey, sit down!

22:16.469 --> 22:19.106
I want to tell you something,

22:20.641 --> 22:23.410
and I mean this with
the utmost respect.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.080
You should consider letting
the family stay.

22:26.113 --> 22:31.384
Having a man or two around just
in case he gets more confused

22:31.418 --> 22:34.055
and hurts himself or
somebody else.

22:34.088 --> 22:38.526
Twenty-eight years I had to wait
for some peace and quiet.

22:42.029 --> 22:44.364
He don't scare me.

22:47.434 --> 22:50.037
You call me any time.

22:50.071 --> 22:52.573
We got the diapers.

22:57.111 --> 23:01.616
Well, it's always nice
to see you, Mae.

23:01.649 --> 23:02.683
Thank you, Dr. Karlock.

23:02.717 --> 23:05.720
Thank you. I'll see myself out.

23:41.155 --> 23:42.657
<i>Hold on.</i>

23:47.261 --> 23:48.696
<i>Hold on.</i>

23:51.699 --> 23:54.168
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

23:55.836 --> 23:57.538
<i>Hold on.</i>

23:57.571 --> 23:59.439
<i>Hold on.</i>

24:02.810 --> 24:04.211
Hello?

24:05.646 --> 24:07.048
Mae.

24:08.282 --> 24:09.617
Hey.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.953
How are ya?

24:11.986 --> 24:15.222
Nah, nah, nah, I just-
uh, hold on a second.

24:17.758 --> 24:19.760
How's my pal?

24:23.731 --> 24:25.533
No kidding.

24:25.566 --> 24:26.466
Of course. Of course.

24:26.499 --> 24:31.238
Yeah, I can... I can be
down there Monday.

24:31.272 --> 24:34.675
Yeah, no problem.

24:34.709 --> 24:37.178
It'll be great to see
both of you.

24:37.211 --> 24:38.980
I'll see you soon.

24:48.255 --> 24:50.524
I'm going to Florida.

25:12.313 --> 25:13.247
<i>Florida?</i>

25:13.280 --> 25:15.082
<i>How come you ever take me
to Florida?</i>

25:15.116 --> 25:17.084
<i>Uh, Tiff, I got business.</i>

25:17.118 --> 25:18.252
<i>Trout season?</i>

25:18.285 --> 25:20.021
<i>More like running around
with your gangster friends</i>

25:20.054 --> 25:21.288
<i>in a swamp.</i>

25:21.322 --> 25:22.556
<i>Come on, doll face.</i>

25:22.590 --> 25:24.091
<i>You know Al needs me.</i>

25:24.125 --> 25:26.127
<i>He don't trust nobody else.</i>

25:40.107 --> 25:43.244
Chicolini here
might look like an idiot,

25:43.277 --> 25:48.115
he might talk like an idiot,
but don't let that fool ya.

25:48.149 --> 25:50.584
He really is an idiot.

25:50.618 --> 25:53.054
I say we give him 10 years
in Leavenworth

25:53.087 --> 25:56.023
or we give him 11 years
in Twelve worth.

25:56.057 --> 25:58.125
Tell ya what I'd do.

25:58.159 --> 26:01.729
I'd take the five to ten
in Woolworth.

26:01.762 --> 26:02.763
Jesus.

26:02.797 --> 26:05.299
You sound like a dying horse.

26:07.201 --> 26:08.969
Nice place you got here.

26:11.906 --> 26:13.941
This is some layout.

26:19.213 --> 26:20.781
What're you doin'?

26:20.815 --> 26:22.883
Coming down to visit you.

26:22.917 --> 26:23.918
Ah.

26:25.052 --> 26:26.987
Well, it's good to see ya.

26:27.021 --> 26:28.355
Yeah, you too.

26:28.389 --> 26:29.623
Yeah.

26:29.657 --> 26:31.092
You lost some weight.

26:32.893 --> 26:34.028
Wow.

26:34.061 --> 26:38.065
This is what a fat fuckin'
retirement looks like, huh?

26:38.099 --> 26:40.968
You got blue skies,
you got a bottle of hooch.

26:41.001 --> 26:42.369
Not bad, Fonse.

26:47.007 --> 26:48.242
What am I lookin' at?

26:48.275 --> 26:49.910
There.

26:52.813 --> 26:54.949
Alligators?

27:02.123 --> 27:03.924
Who the fuck are
you talking about?

27:03.958 --> 27:05.659
Alligators?

27:05.693 --> 27:07.828
Still got that Tommy gun?

27:07.862 --> 27:08.896
Shhh...

27:08.929 --> 27:10.931
Just rub 'em out.

27:11.799 --> 27:13.634
Huh.

27:15.870 --> 27:17.404
Psst.

27:38.859 --> 27:40.161
Hey.

27:44.198 --> 27:45.799
Check it out.

27:50.771 --> 27:52.306
Look at you there, huh?

27:54.441 --> 27:56.177
Look at He-man.

27:57.178 --> 27:58.345
Remember that guy?

27:58.379 --> 27:59.980
No.

28:01.982 --> 28:03.851
Those were the fuckin' days.

28:10.191 --> 28:11.258
Hey, what's up?

28:11.292 --> 28:13.060
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

28:13.093 --> 28:14.728
Alright, alright.

28:29.043 --> 28:32.012
Is there something you wanna
talk to me about?

28:37.418 --> 28:39.753
It's just us on this boat.

28:45.292 --> 28:50.831
I hid ten million bucks.

28:50.864 --> 28:53.200
You did-what?
You did what?

28:53.234 --> 28:58.138
I hid ten million bucks.

29:01.976 --> 29:04.512
You hid ten million-
ten million bucks?

29:04.546 --> 29:06.180
Yeah.

29:06.213 --> 29:07.314
Where?

29:07.348 --> 29:09.149
I don't fuckin' know.

29:15.155 --> 29:17.258
That's all I have left.

29:19.493 --> 29:21.262
Anyone else know?

29:30.605 --> 29:32.473
It'll come back to you.

29:32.507 --> 29:36.010
Guys like you just don't
misplace $10 million. It'll come-

29:36.043 --> 29:38.379
Oh, oh, look at that!

29:38.412 --> 29:40.014
Oh!

29:40.047 --> 29:41.248
What've we got here?

29:41.282 --> 29:42.483
Hey!!!

29:42.517 --> 29:44.018
Fuck!

29:44.051 --> 29:45.119
What the fuck-

29:45.152 --> 29:48.489
You fuckin' bum!

29:48.523 --> 29:49.890
Fucker jumped right up
into the fuckin' boat.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.091
That was mine!

29:51.125 --> 29:52.426
That was mine!

29:52.459 --> 29:54.028
Hey Fonse, where're
you going?

29:54.061 --> 29:54.995
Where are you going?

29:55.029 --> 29:55.963
That was my fish.

29:55.996 --> 29:57.331
Where are you going?

29:57.364 --> 29:59.400
Fonse, woah, woah!

29:59.433 --> 30:00.502
Fonse, hey, Fonse!

30:00.535 --> 30:01.302
What're you-

30:01.335 --> 30:02.469
Was it worth it?!

30:02.504 --> 30:03.370
Fuckin'-

30:04.338 --> 30:05.105
Bum!

30:05.139 --> 30:07.509
What the fuck are you doin',
huh?

30:09.611 --> 30:11.579
Was it worth it?

30:16.016 --> 30:18.419
You wanna go back to prison?

30:18.452 --> 30:22.122
Over a fuckin' swamp animal?

30:22.156 --> 30:24.058
You know, this is what happens

30:24.091 --> 30:27.595
when people spend too much time
in Florida.

30:27.629 --> 30:29.631
They turn into
fuckin' hillbillies.

30:29.664 --> 30:32.567
That's what you're turning into,
you know that, don't ya?

30:32.600 --> 30:35.570
Fuckin' nut ball.

30:35.603 --> 30:38.172
Send you to Bellevue
for a fuckin' head check.

30:43.110 --> 30:45.946
You ok, Fonse?

30:45.979 --> 30:46.947
Hey, come on.

30:46.980 --> 30:48.082
Come on.

30:48.115 --> 30:50.184
Hey, hey.

30:50.217 --> 30:54.321
Hey, it's just a fishing rod.

30:54.355 --> 30:57.124
You tell anybody I will cut
your fuckin' eyes out,

30:57.157 --> 30:58.125
do you understand me?

30:58.158 --> 31:01.028
Tell anybody what?

31:05.466 --> 31:07.468
Just relax.

31:07.502 --> 31:08.670
You got nothin' to worry about.

31:08.703 --> 31:10.938
You got nobody comin' for ya.

31:10.971 --> 31:12.540
Huh?

31:12.574 --> 31:16.910
It's time to just let go.

31:16.944 --> 31:18.212
Alright.

31:26.353 --> 31:28.623
<i>It's ok, Fonse.</i>

31:49.644 --> 31:50.512
Who's her?

31:50.545 --> 31:51.679
Who's her?

31:51.713 --> 31:53.013
It's the witch.

31:53.046 --> 31:54.448
She's followed us here.

31:54.481 --> 31:58.152
<i>Surrender, Dorothy.</i>

31:58.185 --> 31:59.153
<i>Dorothy?</i>

31:59.186 --> 32:00.087
<i>Who's Dorothy?</i>

32:00.120 --> 32:01.455
<i>The wizard! The wizard!</i>

32:01.488 --> 32:02.624
<i>There!</i>

32:02.657 --> 32:04.324
<i>Whatever shall we do?</i>

32:04.358 --> 32:06.460
<i>We've gotta hurry if we're
gonna see the wizard.</i>

32:07.629 --> 32:09.029
<i>Here, here!</i>

32:09.062 --> 32:10.532
<i>Everything is alright.</i>

32:10.565 --> 32:12.499
<i>Stop that now, stop it.</i>

32:41.128 --> 32:42.129
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

32:42.162 --> 32:43.631
<i>He'll announce us at once.</i>

32:43.665 --> 32:45.299
<i>I've as good as got my brain.</i>

32:45.332 --> 32:47.267
I can barely hear
my heart beating.

32:47.301 --> 32:48.603
I'll be home in time
for supper.

32:48.636 --> 32:51.405
<i>In another hour I'll be king
of the forest.</i>

32:51.438 --> 32:53.575
<i>Long live the king.</i>

32:55.643 --> 32:56.711
<i>Sit down.</i>

32:56.744 --> 32:57.745
No!

33:01.248 --> 33:07.187
<i>♪ If
I were king of the forest, ♪</i>

33:07.221 --> 33:13.126
<i>♪ not queen, not duke,
not prince, ♪</i>

33:13.160 --> 33:17.565
<i>♪ my regal robes

33:17.599 --> 33:20.668
<i>♪ would be satin, not cotton,

33:20.702 --> 33:23.771
No, no, no.
You're not flying.

33:23.805 --> 33:27.609
<i>♪ I'd command each thing,

33:27.642 --> 33:34.582

33:35.717 --> 33:38.418
<i>♪ As I'd click my heels ♪</i>

33:40.487 --> 33:42.155
That's the power.

33:47.729 --> 33:49.697
What?

33:49.731 --> 33:51.833
What happened?

33:51.866 --> 33:53.467
Eh?

33:53.501 --> 33:55.537
What happened?

33:55.570 --> 33:58.272
I- I-I gotta take a pee.

34:56.531 --> 34:58.265
<i>Fonse, you ok in there?</i>

34:58.298 --> 34:59.299
<i>Fonse?</i>

34:59.333 --> 35:00.535
Mmm.

35:00.568 --> 35:05.172
<i>How're you doin' in there?</i>

35:05.205 --> 35:06.874
<i>Yeah, don't forget to flush.</i>

35:09.911 --> 35:10.878
I don't get it.

35:10.912 --> 35:14.549
I mean, he's got the whole
forest to himself.

35:14.582 --> 35:15.449
Yeah.

35:15.482 --> 35:16.851
Right?

35:16.884 --> 35:20.555
And all of a sudden some goofy
lookin' broad shows up-

35:20.588 --> 35:22.924
Judy Garland.

35:22.957 --> 35:23.925
Ok, whatever.

35:23.958 --> 35:26.761
She turns up with a couple goons
who look like

35:26.794 --> 35:30.197
they just escaped from Barnum
and Bailey's circus,

35:30.230 --> 35:31.933
and they scamper off down to-
what's it?

35:31.966 --> 35:32.834
Emerald City.

35:32.867 --> 35:33.768
Emerald City.

35:33.801 --> 35:34.468
Yeah.

35:34.502 --> 35:35.937
And they talk to that egghead.

35:35.970 --> 35:38.539
He's a wizard.

35:38.573 --> 35:41.943
But not a wizard
when you see him.

35:41.976 --> 35:42.810
You see?

35:42.844 --> 35:45.345
This guy, he's standing
on a gold mine,

35:45.379 --> 35:46.514
and the lion says

35:46.547 --> 35:48.549
"oh, I wanna go back to being
the King of the Forest".

35:48.583 --> 35:50.183
Get the fuck outta here.

35:50.217 --> 35:52.452
He ain't a coward no more.

35:54.689 --> 35:55.623
You understand?

35:55.657 --> 35:59.426
Yeah, but hat Emerald City
is wide open.

35:59.459 --> 36:01.829
It-it's a fuckin' movie.

36:01.863 --> 36:05.633
He got his courage,
he goes back.

36:05.667 --> 36:06.199
That's it.

36:06.233 --> 36:07.702
Alright. I don't know.

36:07.735 --> 36:08.603
<i>Got it all back on.</i>

36:08.636 --> 36:09.871
Oh, thank fuck for that.

36:09.904 --> 36:12.707
- <i>Oh, thank god.</i>
- <i>Have a good night.</i>

36:12.740 --> 36:14.509
Those are good boys.

36:17.310 --> 36:20.347
When was the last time
you saw your kid?

36:20.380 --> 36:25.553
Oh... um...

36:25.586 --> 36:26.854
Tony.

36:26.888 --> 36:32.359
He's gotta be about what,
18, 19?

36:38.365 --> 36:39.901
Yeah.

36:39.934 --> 36:41.268
She's inside.

36:41.301 --> 36:43.236
She can't hear us.

36:43.270 --> 36:44.539
The other kid.

36:44.572 --> 36:45.873
Did you talk to him?

36:45.907 --> 36:47.474
<i>Cleveland.</i>

36:51.913 --> 36:55.482
What the fuck are you talkin'
to me about?

36:55.516 --> 36:56.851
Alright, alright.

37:00.722 --> 37:01.723
You're done.

37:01.756 --> 37:04.959
Mae! Mae!

37:04.992 --> 37:08.295
Mae!

37:08.328 --> 37:10.464
Mae!

37:10.497 --> 37:10.898
<i>Mae!</i>

37:10.932 --> 37:11.966
<i>What?!</i>

37:11.999 --> 37:13.935
<i>Mae!</i>

37:13.968 --> 37:17.004
What are you screamin' for?

37:17.038 --> 37:18.906
More bourbon.

37:18.940 --> 37:19.907
No, you don't need
no more bourbon.

37:19.941 --> 37:23.978
It's not for me, it's
for my fucking friend.

37:24.011 --> 37:24.846
Yeah, ok.

37:24.879 --> 37:25.880
Ay!

37:25.913 --> 37:27.447
Ay!!

37:27.481 --> 37:28.783
Ay!!!

37:28.816 --> 37:30.885
Come on, are you fuckin' deaf
or what?

37:30.918 --> 37:33.487
Excuse me?

37:33.521 --> 37:35.056
You fuckin' deaf?

37:35.089 --> 37:37.390
Who do you think
you're talking to?

37:41.896 --> 37:43.564
Say that again.

37:45.365 --> 37:46.333
The fuck?!

37:54.909 --> 37:55.843
Fonse?

37:55.877 --> 37:57.945
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:57.979 --> 37:59.680
Honey.

38:28.042 --> 38:29.811
Are you ok?

38:29.844 --> 38:32.412
No.

38:32.445 --> 38:36.717
I'm not ok.

38:36.751 --> 38:45.560
I want all these fuckin' bums
away from me, you understand?

38:45.593 --> 38:52.600
You got goons walkin' around
and they got guns in front-

38:52.633 --> 38:56.571
in front of the kids.

38:56.604 --> 38:59.707
There are no kids here,
Fonse.

39:06.848 --> 39:10.852
Do-do you even know
what these people do?

39:13.955 --> 39:17.825
They do whatever
you tell them to do.

39:19.994 --> 39:20.962
No.

39:20.995 --> 39:22.029
Yeah.

39:22.063 --> 39:23.130
No.

39:23.164 --> 39:24.966
Yeah.

39:25.933 --> 39:30.671
Sweetie, listen.

39:30.705 --> 39:37.111
I can see it on your face
and I can see it in your eyes

39:37.144 --> 39:41.448
that you are an angel.

39:41.481 --> 39:47.688
I can see that you got
broken wings.

39:47.722 --> 39:49.190
Yeah.

39:49.223 --> 39:52.459
I would very much like
to fix

39:52.492 --> 39:56.597
those broken wings for ya,
if I could.

40:01.636 --> 40:04.639
But I don't know
who the fuck you are.

40:04.672 --> 40:07.174
And I don't even need to know
who the fuck you are

40:07.208 --> 40:09.610
to know you lettin' it happen.

40:09.644 --> 40:10.211
Stop it.

40:10.244 --> 40:11.746
Shame on you.

40:12.980 --> 40:14.882
The fuck is that?

40:18.485 --> 40:19.887
Why are you touching me?

40:19.921 --> 40:21.589
Why you gotta touch me?

40:29.496 --> 40:30.631
A couple of the boys uh,

40:30.665 --> 40:31.866
heard some noises coming
from the house?

40:31.899 --> 40:35.069
Just uh, wanted to check in
and make sure everything was ok.

40:35.102 --> 40:36.671
Yeah.

40:43.878 --> 40:47.615
Gino?

40:47.648 --> 40:53.087
I don't want no one talkin'
to him.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.823
Yeah, you got it.

40:55.856 --> 40:58.159
Anything you and Al need,
just let me know.

40:58.192 --> 40:59.961
Gino.

41:01.862 --> 41:05.266
We don't say that name here.

41:05.299 --> 41:07.735
My apologies, Mae.

41:11.906 --> 41:13.007
<i>Everything okay in there?</i>

41:13.040 --> 41:14.809
Yeah, everything's fine.

41:38.799 --> 41:40.768
<i>Operator. How may
I connect your call?</i>

41:40.801 --> 41:45.106
I need to speak
to a police officer.

41:45.139 --> 41:46.040
<i>...one moment.</i>

41:46.073 --> 41:47.742
Thank you.

41:47.775 --> 41:50.277
<i>Police dispatch,
what is your emergency?</i>

41:50.311 --> 41:53.180
I think uh, I think
I may have been uh,

41:53.214 --> 41:54.815
I think I may have
been kidnapped.

41:54.849 --> 41:55.750
<i>Where are you, sir?</i>

41:55.783 --> 41:56.584
I don't know.

41:56.617 --> 41:57.785
I don't know.

41:57.818 --> 41:59.954
<i>I don't know what's uh-
what's going on but they uh-</i>

41:59.987 --> 42:03.157
<i>they got weapons and they uh-</i>

42:03.190 --> 42:06.961
<i>I can't do this no more,
you know?</i>

42:06.994 --> 42:07.862
Sir?

42:07.895 --> 42:10.931
Because it-it-it ain't-
it ain't me.

42:10.965 --> 42:13.834
<i>Last name, sir?</i>

42:13.868 --> 42:16.971
I- I don't know, you know?

42:17.004 --> 42:18.205
I don't-I don't know.

42:18.239 --> 42:19.440
I don't fuckin' know this guy

42:19.473 --> 42:25.212
and I don't know any of these
fuckin' people-any at all.

42:25.246 --> 42:26.714
You see, uh...

42:30.651 --> 42:31.252
<i>Sir?</i>

42:31.285 --> 42:32.753
See, I live on a farm.

42:32.787 --> 42:33.788
<i>I can't hear you, sir.</i>

42:33.821 --> 42:36.323
I said I live on a fuckin' farm.

42:36.357 --> 42:37.458
<i>On a farm, you said?</i>

42:37.491 --> 42:41.896
No, not on a fuckin' farm,
I'm in this fuckin' house.

42:41.929 --> 42:43.297
I don't know how I...

42:45.099 --> 42:48.169
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>

42:51.739 --> 42:53.874
I gotta go.

44:05.212 --> 44:08.716

44:08.749 --> 44:12.353

<i>Get up here right now!
You're making me worried.</i>

44:28.135 --> 44:30.070
<i>I can't do this every
single day...</i>

44:30.104 --> 44:32.406
<i>Every time I turn around...</i>

44:41.982 --> 44:43.217
<i>How about it for our
good friend, Al.</i>

44:46.320 --> 44:49.089
<i>Al! Al!

49:19.226 --> 49:20.662
Tell him what you did.

49:21.563 --> 49:23.297
<i>Answer the question,

Oh, yeah.

Mmm...

49:44.451 --> 49:46.621
Yeah, it's uh, yeah.

Fuck you.

50:24.358 --> 50:27.327
It don't matter to me.

50:27.361 --> 50:29.831
<i>You understand?</i>

50:29.864 --> 50:31.431
You understand?

50:31.465 --> 50:32.399
Whatever you say, Gino.

50:32.432 --> 50:34.067
Yeah.

50:38.171 --> 50:40.374
Catch you later, Fonse.

50:44.344 --> 50:46.514
<i>Hey boss. Let's go.</i>

50:47.615 --> 50:49.182
Come on.

50:51.351 --> 50:53.253
Jesus Christ, look at this.

50:57.291 --> 50:58.593
<i>Get this bum outta here.</i>

50:58.626 --> 51:00.528
<i>Alright, you heard him.</i>

51:00.562 --> 51:03.130
<i>Let's clean this shit up.</i>

51:12.372 --> 51:13.775
Hey!

51:20.582 --> 51:22.617
Ok, boss. We'll be out front.

51:22.650 --> 51:24.384
Yeah.

51:42.704 --> 51:43.838
Where's the kid?

51:50.177 --> 51:51.613
Ow.

52:05.893 --> 52:07.829
Where's the kid?

52:07.862 --> 52:10.665
He's at my place.

52:26.246 --> 52:28.382
Where is it?

52:35.657 --> 52:37.357
You hear that?

52:41.294 --> 52:42.462
Si.

52:52.339 --> 52:53.941
Ahhh...

53:50.932 --> 53:53.634
<i>Hey, watch your mouth!
Watch your mouth!</i>

53:53.668 --> 53:56.504
<i>Shoot those fucker!</i>

53:56.537 --> 53:57.572
<i>Piece of shit!</i>

53:57.605 --> 54:01.509
<i>Don't let them get away!
You fuckers, fuck you!</i>

54:18.593 --> 54:20.061
I'm sorry.

54:21.529 --> 54:22.530
I'm sorry.

54:31.906 --> 54:33.440
Hey!

54:34.575 --> 54:36.711
Hey!

54:42.482 --> 54:44.018
Hey!

54:44.051 --> 54:45.520
No, wait!

55:19.086 --> 55:22.056
<i>Oh god, please, no.</i>

56:29.624 --> 56:32.994
He had a stroke.

56:33.027 --> 56:34.862
And?

56:34.896 --> 56:39.700
He'll live.

56:39.734 --> 56:43.004
I'll stay with him for a while.

56:43.037 --> 56:46.674
Maybe I can get him
to talk with me.

56:46.707 --> 56:50.645
Well, if you don't get
some answers, Doc,

56:50.678 --> 56:53.114
the clemency is as good
as dead.

56:56.584 --> 56:58.753
I'll see what I can do.

57:40.628 --> 57:42.462
Good morning.

57:43.664 --> 57:45.967
Sss...

57:46.000 --> 57:47.201
What?

57:47.234 --> 57:48.903
Snakes...

57:48.936 --> 57:50.137
You want water?

57:50.171 --> 57:51.072
Eh.

57:51.105 --> 57:53.741
Can you answer me
some questions first?

57:55.643 --> 57:59.547
How many fingers
am I holding?

57:59.580 --> 58:02.249
Hmm?

58:02.283 --> 58:04.752
F- f-four.

58:04.785 --> 58:07.822
Mmmhmm.

58:07.855 --> 58:11.792
How old are you?

58:11.826 --> 58:14.962
Four...

58:14.996 --> 58:18.165
No. You're 48 years old.

58:18.199 --> 58:22.570
You're 48.

58:22.603 --> 58:26.140
Here you go, Fonse.
There you go.

58:26.173 --> 58:28.976
Ok.

58:29.010 --> 58:30.878
Get it all in there.

58:35.116 --> 58:37.818
He's sustained a permanent
degree of damage

58:37.852 --> 58:40.187
to his brain functions.

58:40.221 --> 58:42.957
Minor paralysis
on his left side,

58:42.990 --> 58:44.992
mainly up his shoulder
to his mouth,

58:45.026 --> 58:48.062
although I suspect that could
get a little better over time

58:48.095 --> 58:50.064
with daily rehabilitation.

58:50.097 --> 58:53.601
We ain't goin' anywhere,
so we're here.

58:53.634 --> 58:57.038
I think that would be best.
For his sake.

58:57.071 --> 59:00.174
There's a few changes
that we need to make.

59:00.207 --> 59:02.076
No cigars.

59:02.109 --> 59:03.778
For how long?

59:05.379 --> 59:07.014
Ever.

59:11.352 --> 59:16.624
I suggest we give
him one of these.

59:25.166 --> 59:26.901
What is he, fuckin' Bugs Bunny?

59:28.069 --> 59:30.271
He's going to go on a fuckin'
rampage.

59:30.304 --> 59:31.472
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

59:31.506 --> 59:34.708
We want to keep him alive
and as comfortable as possible

59:34.742 --> 59:36.977
for as long as we have
him here.

59:37.011 --> 59:39.613
He ain't gonna
fall for that shit?

59:39.647 --> 59:42.083
He's gonna have to accept it.

59:42.116 --> 59:43.784
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

59:57.098 --> 59:58.365
Ah...

1:00:02.837 --> 1:00:05.005
Are you finished?

1:00:05.039 --> 1:00:06.173
Eh.

1:00:06.207 --> 1:00:07.374
Ok.

1:00:07.408 --> 1:00:09.210
That looks great, Fonse.

1:00:09.243 --> 1:00:10.177
Tell you what, let's-

1:00:11.278 --> 1:00:16.183
Let's put that with
your collection right here.

1:00:16.217 --> 1:00:20.254
I'm gonna let you choose
the next one.

1:00:36.770 --> 1:00:39.039
Well, now, you already drew
the platypus.

1:00:39.073 --> 1:00:40.274
Yeah.

1:00:40.307 --> 1:00:43.110
You know what this is?

1:00:43.144 --> 1:00:45.746
It's a bag of money.

1:00:54.388 --> 1:00:56.257
That's the last one for today.

1:01:02.930 --> 1:01:06.767
Tell you what,
you draw this,

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.170
I won't bother you again.

1:01:09.203 --> 1:01:11.839
You can sit in your chair
all day.

1:01:24.752 --> 1:01:26.120
Come in.

1:01:31.458 --> 1:01:34.361
Hey.

1:01:34.395 --> 1:01:36.397
I brought you some carrots.

1:01:38.866 --> 1:01:42.803
Hey, you wanna see a picture
that your dad just drew?

1:01:42.836 --> 1:01:44.471
Yeah.

1:01:44.506 --> 1:01:45.773
This is really good.

1:01:47.208 --> 1:01:49.743
No, no, no.

1:01:49.777 --> 1:01:50.744
Spit.

1:01:51.546 --> 1:01:52.746
Spit.

1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:53.948
Out!

1:01:55.416 --> 1:01:56.850
Out!

1:01:59.019 --> 1:02:00.287
Ok.

1:02:03.457 --> 1:02:05.092
Ok.

1:02:06.026 --> 1:02:07.428
We don't want him choking.

1:02:07.461 --> 1:02:08.429
There you go.

1:02:08.462 --> 1:02:11.899
Hey Doc, you mind if I uh,
had a little time?

1:02:11.932 --> 1:02:14.068
Sure, of course.

1:02:16.036 --> 1:02:17.838
You let me know if you
need anything, ok?

1:02:17.871 --> 1:02:20.741
Cu-cu-cluck.

1:02:29.984 --> 1:02:31.285
Psst.

1:02:31.318 --> 1:02:32.920
Pop.

1:02:35.022 --> 1:02:37.358
You can drop the act now.

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:47.569
I like your picture.

1:02:47.602 --> 1:02:49.403
Those yours, too?

1:02:49.436 --> 1:02:50.572
Eh.

1:02:50.605 --> 1:02:51.939
Can I see 'em?

1:02:51.972 --> 1:02:53.774
Eh.

1:02:54.408 --> 1:02:55.943
What is this?

1:02:55.976 --> 1:02:59.446
Pla... ty... pus...

1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:00.948
It's a platypus?

1:03:00.981 --> 1:03:03.384
Yeah.

1:03:03.417 --> 1:03:06.453
Look at that.

1:03:06.487 --> 1:03:07.488
That's-that's a duck.

1:03:08.422 --> 1:03:09.591
Yeah.

1:03:09.624 --> 1:03:11.825
That's what ducks do.

1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:14.596
Who's this?

1:03:14.629 --> 1:03:18.966
He's got a little balloon.

1:03:18.999 --> 1:03:21.235
That's Tony.

1:03:21.268 --> 1:03:23.871
Who?

1:03:23.904 --> 1:03:25.439
Tony.

1:03:25.472 --> 1:03:29.143
Who's Tony?

1:03:29.176 --> 1:03:31.312
My... son.

1:03:35.082 --> 1:03:37.084
Your son, Tony?

1:03:40.254 --> 1:03:42.456
Pop, what are you
talking about?

1:03:45.459 --> 1:03:47.227
I'm your son.

1:03:54.636 --> 1:03:56.937
Ehh...

1:03:56.970 --> 1:03:58.606
Nah.

1:04:09.116 --> 1:04:11.218
T- Tony.

1:04:22.930 --> 1:04:25.032
Want another one?

1:04:27.368 --> 1:04:29.002
Yeah.

1:04:32.306 --> 1:04:33.240
Not too much.

1:04:33.273 --> 1:04:35.209
Aah.

1:05:29.496 --> 1:05:30.665
Fonse.

1:05:30.698 --> 1:05:35.603
Can you put that down so I can
talk to you for a minute?

1:05:35.637 --> 1:05:37.137
Fonse?

1:05:42.009 --> 1:05:47.615
I'll always remember,
even when we was kids,

1:05:47.649 --> 1:05:55.222
you always had it all up here.

1:05:55.255 --> 1:05:58.693
You always hated paper.

1:05:58.726 --> 1:06:00.628
You didn't trust nobody,
nothin'.

1:06:00.662 --> 1:06:04.465
Not even your own
fuckin' family.

1:06:04.498 --> 1:06:10.137
I never took offence
by it or nothin'.

1:06:10.170 --> 1:06:14.308
I want you to tell me
if you hid anything.

1:06:14.341 --> 1:06:17.745
Like money.

1:06:17.779 --> 1:06:20.582
I need to know
where the fuck it is.

1:06:20.615 --> 1:06:23.685
These cocksuckers are gonna
get it either way,

1:06:23.718 --> 1:06:26.186
so it makes no difference.

1:06:30.658 --> 1:06:33.494
We got nothing, Fonse,
you understand?

1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:48.810
Well, I hope one of our kids has
in him what you had in you

1:06:48.843 --> 1:06:51.445
because that's our only hope.

1:06:56.518 --> 1:06:58.686
<i>Everything ok, boss?</i>

1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:00.755
Yeah, we're fine. Thanks.

1:07:02.524 --> 1:07:04.324
If you want my opinion,

1:07:04.358 --> 1:07:07.762
Gino and the boys and those
fuckin' Cubans?

1:07:12.432 --> 1:07:14.602
They're part of this
whole fuckin' thing.

1:07:14.636 --> 1:07:17.170
They're a bunch of rats.

1:07:17.204 --> 1:07:19.507
That's just my hunch.

1:07:19.541 --> 1:07:21.308
I gotta take a leak.

1:07:21.341 --> 1:07:25.145
When I come back we'll walk
around the pool, ok?

1:08:36.249 --> 1:08:38.586
Who's making you
the most nuts?

1:08:43.390 --> 1:08:46.728
You know, I got an idea, ma.

1:08:46.761 --> 1:08:48.428
I think we can make
a couple bucks.

1:08:48.462 --> 1:08:51.365
Yeah? What's that?

1:08:51.398 --> 1:08:53.233
I think we should put pops
in the zoo.

1:08:55.402 --> 1:08:56.871
I mean, hey, we glue some
hair on him,

1:08:56.904 --> 1:08:58.673
throw him in with
the monkeys...

1:08:58.706 --> 1:09:00.240
it's too easy to picture,
isn't it?

1:09:00.273 --> 1:09:00.742
No, it's... stop.

1:09:05.947 --> 1:09:07.515
You see this?

1:09:07.548 --> 1:09:08.716
What is that?

1:09:08.750 --> 1:09:10.384
That is Tony.

1:09:10.417 --> 1:09:11.886
Who's Tony?

1:09:11.919 --> 1:09:13.921
It's his son, Tony.

1:09:21.294 --> 1:09:22.530
The poor guy.

1:09:28.770 --> 1:09:30.303
Just to be clear I don't
have some brother

1:09:30.337 --> 1:09:32.507
out there named Tony, do I?

1:09:41.549 --> 1:09:45.753
He was a good father to you.

1:09:45.787 --> 1:09:47.689
He's still here.

1:09:49.256 --> 1:09:50.892
Yeah.

1:09:56.864 --> 1:09:58.432
Take your time.

1:10:10.712 --> 1:10:12.780
How's it going, Mae?

1:10:12.814 --> 1:10:14.214
Fonse.

1:10:15.415 --> 1:10:16.450
<i>Hey, Gino.</i>

1:10:16.483 --> 1:10:17.518
Hey, Rose.

1:10:17.552 --> 1:10:19.219
<i>Have a seat, Gino.</i>

1:10:20.888 --> 1:10:23.791
Get some wine.

1:10:23.825 --> 1:10:25.593
Want more?

1:10:29.396 --> 1:10:31.733
<i>Come on, chew your food.</i>

1:10:31.766 --> 1:10:33.501
<i>Looks good.</i>

1:10:52.587 --> 1:10:54.021
<i>What?</i>

1:11:08.669 --> 1:11:09.570
Oh my god!

1:11:09.604 --> 1:11:10.071
Oh my god!

1:11:10.104 --> 1:11:10.905
Pop!

1:11:10.938 --> 1:11:11.906
<i>Fonse!</i>

1:11:11.939 --> 1:11:12.507
What'd I do?

1:11:12.540 --> 1:11:13.741
<i>Gino, just go, alright?</i>

1:11:13.775 --> 1:11:14.675
<i>Just go, please.</i>

1:11:14.709 --> 1:11:17.011
Somebody help me get him up
off the floor?

1:11:17.044 --> 1:11:17.812
Grab the diapers.

1:11:17.845 --> 1:11:18.780
I got 'em, I got 'em.

1:11:18.813 --> 1:11:20.447
Pop? Pop? You're ok.

1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:21.816
You're ok.

1:11:21.849 --> 1:11:23.785
Go easy!
You're hurting him.

1:11:23.818 --> 1:11:25.052
Let's get the chair, please.

1:11:25.086 --> 1:11:27.789
One, two, three, get him up.

1:11:42.003 --> 1:11:44.505
Get some rest, pal.

1:12:22.176 --> 1:12:24.846
<i>Our special Cobb theatre
presentation of</i>

1:12:24.879 --> 1:12:27.882
<i>the St. Valentine's Day
Massacre continues.</i>

1:12:27.915 --> 1:12:29.617
<i>Thursday morning,
Chicago.</i>

1:12:29.650 --> 1:12:32.553
<i>Johnny and the gang,
disguised as Chicago's finest,</i>

1:12:32.587 --> 1:12:35.556
<i>cruising the streets of the south
side in a stolen paddy-wagon.</i>

1:12:35.590 --> 1:12:36.824
<i>Hey! There they are!</i>

1:12:36.858 --> 1:12:39.026
<i>Torrio's guys. Get 'em!</i>

1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:40.493
<i>You're under arrest, mister.</i>

1:12:40.528 --> 1:12:41.896
<i>Arrest? What for?</i>

1:12:41.929 --> 1:12:42.930
<i>Quiet, you.</i>

1:12:42.964 --> 1:12:44.699
<i>Put your hands behind your back.</i>

1:12:44.732 --> 1:12:47.568
<i>Don't I know you from somewhere?</i>

1:12:49.904 --> 1:12:52.173
<i>Torrio's men lined up
against the wall.</i>

1:12:52.206 --> 1:12:55.176
<i>Someone tell us, officer,
what's this about?</i>

1:12:55.209 --> 1:12:57.612
<i>Al Capone sends
his regards.</i>

1:13:05.519 --> 1:13:07.420
<i>Happy Valentine's Day!</i>

1:13:10.992 --> 1:13:13.426
<i>Sources close to the Chicago
authorities said</i>

1:13:13.460 --> 1:13:15.162
<i>only Al Capone kills
like that.</i>

1:13:15.196 --> 1:13:16.731
<i>How do you comment,
Mr. Capone?</i>

1:13:16.764 --> 1:13:18.566
<i>Well, I'll tell you what
Al Capone says.</i>

1:13:18.599 --> 1:13:21.102
<i>Al Capone is an honest
law-abiding</i>

1:13:21.135 --> 1:13:22.303
<i>American businessman.</i>

1:13:22.336 --> 1:13:24.739
<i>The only killing he makes
is in the best of services</i>

1:13:24.772 --> 1:13:25.706
<i>to millions of...</i>

1:13:27.241 --> 1:13:28.175
<i>Go on, boys.</i>

1:13:28.209 --> 1:13:31.646
<i>Me and Johnny got some
private business.</i>

1:13:31.679 --> 1:13:33.147
<i>Everything alright, boss?</i>

1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:35.750
<i>Yeah, beautiful.</i>

1:13:35.783 --> 1:13:38.152
<i>You know, I've known you
since we was kids, Johnny.</i>

1:13:38.185 --> 1:13:39.654
<i>That's right, boss.</i>

1:13:39.687 --> 1:13:41.454
<i>You always been loyal,
Johnny.</i>

1:13:42.489 --> 1:13:43.490
<i>Like a dog.</i>

1:13:44.491 --> 1:13:45.425
<i>Well...</i>

1:13:45.458 --> 1:13:46.861
<i>That's why it hurts me,
I gotta do this.</i>

1:13:46.894 --> 1:13:47.828
<i>Do what, Al?</i>

1:13:49.764 --> 1:13:50.865
<i>You sold me out!</i>

1:13:51.899 --> 1:13:53.634
<i>You sold me out to Torrio!</i>

1:13:54.669 --> 1:13:55.468
<i>To the Feds!</i>

1:13:56.671 --> 1:13:57.705
<i>To the whole-</i>

1:14:06.881 --> 1:14:09.482
They never get it right.

1:14:09.517 --> 1:14:11.484
I never sold no one out.

1:14:11.519 --> 1:14:12.954
You know that.

1:14:19.794 --> 1:14:22.063
I took a little off the top.

1:14:22.096 --> 1:14:24.231
I'm not proud of it.

1:14:24.265 --> 1:14:25.800
You made the right move.

1:14:25.833 --> 1:14:28.703
I'da done the same thing
if I was you.

1:14:31.539 --> 1:14:33.040
You don't skim.

1:14:43.117 --> 1:14:47.688
The only thing that
really matters, Fonse,

1:14:47.722 --> 1:14:51.092
is how a man treats
his family.

1:14:51.125 --> 1:14:55.730
You'll always be a hero to every
stiff breakin' his back.

1:14:55.763 --> 1:15:00.835
Not a lot of goons from Carol
Street could state that claim.

1:15:00.868 --> 1:15:02.970
You're a good man, Fonse.

1:15:07.208 --> 1:15:08.876
Don't worry, pal.

1:15:08.909 --> 1:15:11.812
I didn't feel nothin'.

1:15:11.846 --> 1:15:14.648
You took me off the street.

1:15:14.682 --> 1:15:16.917
I'll always respect you.

1:15:21.856 --> 1:15:26.093
You know, you seem like
a really nice fella.

1:15:26.127 --> 1:15:33.634
Maybe if ya had some courage
you might be able

1:15:33.667 --> 1:15:36.570
to find yourself some
new friends.

1:15:46.313 --> 1:15:49.717
I think I know where
you buried that money.

1:16:03.397 --> 1:16:04.932
Oh...

1:16:09.837 --> 1:16:11.672
Oh...

1:16:23.751 --> 1:16:27.721
Look in these.

1:16:27.755 --> 1:16:32.960
They'll help guide you
to the key.

1:16:32.993 --> 1:16:35.329
I'll see you sometime,
Fonse.

1:16:39.233 --> 1:16:40.701
No!

1:16:40.734 --> 1:16:43.971
No, no, no!

1:16:44.004 --> 1:16:45.372
What was that screamin'?

1:16:45.406 --> 1:16:46.640
Oh my god,
let him be ok.

1:16:46.674 --> 1:16:48.175
- Fonse, we're coming!
- Fonse!

1:16:48.209 --> 1:16:49.243
What the hell's going on?

1:16:51.745 --> 1:16:52.813
What's wrong?

1:16:52.847 --> 1:16:54.081
<i>No!</i>

1:16:54.115 --> 1:16:55.216
- No!
- What's wrong?

1:16:55.249 --> 1:16:55.983
Fonse!

1:16:56.016 --> 1:16:56.917
Shhh.

1:16:56.951 --> 1:16:57.885
No!

1:16:57.918 --> 1:16:59.153
No!

1:16:59.186 --> 1:17:00.754
What is that?!

1:17:02.256 --> 1:17:03.190
There's nothing there.

1:17:03.224 --> 1:17:03.958
Hey! Hey!

1:17:03.991 --> 1:17:05.126
Hey, hey, hey!

1:17:05.159 --> 1:17:06.827
That's disgusting!

1:17:06.861 --> 1:17:07.795
<i>No!</i>

1:17:07.828 --> 1:17:08.996
<i>No!</i>

1:17:09.029 --> 1:17:10.731
<i>No!</i>

1:17:25.179 --> 1:17:29.817
About 22, 23 years ago
I was in Minneapolis.

1:17:29.850 --> 1:17:35.322
I was your age, sitting on this
old accountant, Jewish guy.

1:17:35.356 --> 1:17:37.691
Supposed to be some
big laundering conduit

1:17:37.725 --> 1:17:38.459
in the mid-west.

1:17:38.492 --> 1:17:39.693
Anyway, I'm sitting
on my ass.

1:17:39.727 --> 1:17:40.694
Two years, nothing.

1:17:40.728 --> 1:17:41.630
Three years, nothing.

1:17:41.662 --> 1:17:43.264
So, you know, I tell 'em
back in New York,

1:17:43.297 --> 1:17:47.034
fellas, there's nothing here.

1:17:47.067 --> 1:17:51.038
Hoover says to me "Nordhoff,
you're-you're looking

1:17:51.071 --> 1:17:55.476
"but you're not thinking."
Ok?

1:17:55.510 --> 1:17:57.378
Four years, I'm looking,
I'm thinking.

1:17:57.411 --> 1:17:59.079
Five years.

1:17:59.113 --> 1:18:01.282
Guess what happened?

1:18:01.315 --> 1:18:02.183
What?

1:18:02.216 --> 1:18:03.484
My dick froze off.

1:18:03.518 --> 1:18:04.118
It's true.

1:18:04.151 --> 1:18:06.353
Be glad you're in Florida.

1:18:06.387 --> 1:18:07.454
I got something for you.

1:18:07.488 --> 1:18:08.322
He's dead.

1:18:08.355 --> 1:18:09.156
No.

1:18:09.190 --> 1:18:10.257
Alright.

1:18:10.291 --> 1:18:11.759
He's been saying a lot of
very interesting things.

1:18:11.792 --> 1:18:13.894
Sure, he has
full-blown dementia.

1:18:13.928 --> 1:18:15.963
I think I kind of owe it to
a 20-year investigation

1:18:15.996 --> 1:18:18.199
to look in his eyes and know
for sure before he's gone.

1:18:18.232 --> 1:18:22.002
I don't know how to break
this to you, son.

1:18:22.036 --> 1:18:26.440
I don't give a shit
about Al Capone.

1:18:26.473 --> 1:18:27.141
I don't.

1:18:27.174 --> 1:18:28.809
He dies, we dig his place up,

1:18:28.842 --> 1:18:30.844
find whatever's there
and move on.

1:18:30.878 --> 1:18:32.079
Do you know what
the difference is, sir,

1:18:32.112 --> 1:18:35.316
between Adolf Hitler
and Al Capone?

1:18:35.349 --> 1:18:37.785
Hitler's dead.

1:18:37.818 --> 1:18:40.487
Capone lives like a king
in Florida.

1:18:40.522 --> 1:18:43.991
Maybe he's crazy,
maybe he's not.

1:18:44.024 --> 1:18:46.160
All I know is a man who spends
his entire life lying

1:18:46.193 --> 1:18:54.435
to everyone about everything,
the truth rots in there.

1:18:54.468 --> 1:18:59.106
Let's catch some of his marbles
on the way out.

1:18:59.139 --> 1:19:00.307
I gotta make a call.

1:19:00.341 --> 1:19:02.343
The lawyer's paying.

1:19:02.376 --> 1:19:05.513
Just don't make me
look stupid, huh, kid?

1:19:05.547 --> 1:19:07.214
Thank you, Mr. Nordhoff.

1:19:07.248 --> 1:19:08.215
Yeah.

1:19:28.369 --> 1:19:30.070
Mr. Mattingly.

1:19:30.104 --> 1:19:31.238
Good morning.

1:19:38.879 --> 1:19:40.214
This is Agent
Stirling H. Crawford

1:19:40.247 --> 1:19:42.049
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

1:19:42.082 --> 1:19:44.952
Present with me is my colleague,
Agent Clifford M. Harris,

1:19:44.985 --> 1:19:47.421
and we are here at the residence
of Mr. Alfonse Capone

1:19:47.454 --> 1:19:49.290
in Palm Island, Florida.

1:19:49.323 --> 1:19:51.125
In attendance is
Mr. Alfonse Capone

1:19:51.158 --> 1:19:54.529
and his legal representative,
Mr. Harold V. Mattingly.

1:19:54.562 --> 1:19:55.630
The following interview
will be recorded

1:19:55.664 --> 1:19:59.199
for the investigative records
relating to case P51B.

1:19:59.233 --> 1:20:00.467
Mr. Capone, anything you say

1:20:00.502 --> 1:20:02.970
can be used against you
or anyone you mention

1:20:03.003 --> 1:20:05.139
in your statements
by the federal courts.

1:20:05.172 --> 1:20:07.174
Do you agree to the conditions
of this interview?

1:20:07.207 --> 1:20:08.342
Yeah.

1:20:08.375 --> 1:20:09.343
Ok.

1:20:09.376 --> 1:20:11.145
So, Mr. Capone, can you for
the record state

1:20:11.178 --> 1:20:13.981
your name, age, and your
place of birth?

1:20:14.014 --> 1:20:14.848
Eh?

1:20:14.882 --> 1:20:18.052
Go ahead, Fonse.

1:20:18.085 --> 1:20:21.455
Your name, age, and
your place of birth.

1:20:27.161 --> 1:20:28.228
My client may have
some difficulty

1:20:28.262 --> 1:20:29.363
answering for himself.

1:20:29.396 --> 1:20:31.965
If requested by my client
I'll answer on his behalf.

1:20:31.999 --> 1:20:33.967
We understand that, of course.

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:35.570
We'd appreciate the
opportunity for Mr. Capone

1:20:35.603 --> 1:20:37.572
to at least try to answer
our questions

1:20:37.605 --> 1:20:39.840
to the best of his ability.

1:20:42.142 --> 1:20:43.177
Knock yourself out.

1:20:43.210 --> 1:20:44.411
Thank you.

1:20:44.445 --> 1:20:46.380
So, Mr. Capone, can you for
the record state

1:20:46.413 --> 1:20:49.450
your name, age,
and place of birth?

1:20:54.154 --> 1:20:57.157
On behalf of my client,
his name is Alfonse Capone,

1:20:57.191 --> 1:21:01.295
C-A-P-O-N-E, born
January 17th, 1899,

1:21:01.328 --> 1:21:02.630
Brooklyn, New York.

1:21:02.664 --> 1:21:05.999
Mr. Capone, prior to your
incarceration in California in 1931

1:21:06.033 --> 1:21:10.971
did you keep any financial
records in your possession?

1:21:12.172 --> 1:21:14.576
On behalf of my client, no.

1:21:14.609 --> 1:21:16.544
He kept no information
of that kind.

1:21:16.578 --> 1:21:18.178
So we understand it that
you have been ill now

1:21:18.212 --> 1:21:19.681
for quite some time.

1:21:19.714 --> 1:21:21.348
Yeah.

1:21:21.382 --> 1:21:24.385
In fact I have here that you
originally contracted syphilis

1:21:24.418 --> 1:21:27.454
while you were under the age
of 15 years old.

1:21:27.488 --> 1:21:28.922
Is that correct?

1:21:28.956 --> 1:21:30.924
Yes, per his medical records.

1:21:30.958 --> 1:21:33.360
Mr. Capone, were you or were
you not defacto chief

1:21:33.394 --> 1:21:35.462
of the Chicago Outfit
Criminal Organization

1:21:35.496 --> 1:21:37.931
which presided over the illicit
sale of liquor products

1:21:37.965 --> 1:21:41.368
during the nationwide ban
prior to its lift in 1933?

1:21:41.402 --> 1:21:42.336
Nope.

1:21:42.369 --> 1:21:43.303
On behalf of my client, nope.

1:21:43.337 --> 1:21:44.104
No.

1:21:44.138 --> 1:21:44.672
Right.

1:21:44.706 --> 1:21:46.608
Ok.

1:21:46.641 --> 1:21:48.610
- Turn that off.
- Got it.

1:21:48.643 --> 1:21:51.111
I'd like to apologize.

1:21:51.145 --> 1:21:53.347
Mr. Mattingly, I am sorry.

1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:54.381
Harris-

1:21:54.415 --> 1:21:56.350
What's this about, Crawford?

1:21:56.383 --> 1:21:58.485
We have information that your
client may have tucked away

1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:01.523
a very large sum of money.

1:22:01.556 --> 1:22:04.992
About $10 million.

1:22:05.025 --> 1:22:06.326
<i>I know nothing of this.</i>

1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:08.295
Well, I think your client does.

1:22:08.328 --> 1:22:12.700
Mr. Capone, can you tell me
where you hid that money?

1:22:12.734 --> 1:22:15.068
Oh.

1:22:15.102 --> 1:22:18.205
Hmm.

1:22:18.238 --> 1:22:20.174
I'm talking to you, Al.

1:22:22.476 --> 1:22:23.511
Yeah.

1:22:23.545 --> 1:22:24.512
Where's the money?

1:22:24.546 --> 1:22:26.947
Yeah.

1:22:27.214 --> 1:22:29.283
Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Capone.

1:22:29.316 --> 1:22:31.452
While I personally believe
that you deserve every ounce

1:22:31.485 --> 1:22:33.420
of torture and everlasting
despair

1:22:33.454 --> 1:22:35.590
that awaits you
in the next life,

1:22:35.623 --> 1:22:37.157
your family has done nothing
to deserve

1:22:37.191 --> 1:22:38.693
what's coming to them
in this one.

1:22:38.726 --> 1:22:40.060
No prominent jobs-

1:22:40.093 --> 1:22:41.295
This is harassment.

1:22:41.328 --> 1:22:43.665
No decent education so long
as their last name is Capone.

1:22:43.698 --> 1:22:45.199
Other than this pile
of cement here

1:22:45.232 --> 1:22:46.501
they're gonna be left
with nothing of your legacy.

1:22:46.534 --> 1:22:47.468
<i>Hey!</i>

1:22:47.502 --> 1:22:48.703
Only a penniless, bitter
life of alienation.

1:22:48.736 --> 1:22:49.504
<i>Crawford!</i>

1:22:49.537 --> 1:22:51.506
No new friends,
no new beginnings.

1:22:51.539 --> 1:22:54.475
And we will watch them.

1:22:54.509 --> 1:22:56.778
Every single day
until the day they die,

1:22:56.811 --> 1:22:58.111
just like you.

1:23:04.485 --> 1:23:06.186
Oh.

1:23:11.124 --> 1:23:13.661
Oh.

1:23:13.695 --> 1:23:16.129
Ok, gentlemen.

1:23:16.163 --> 1:23:17.498
Oh, no.

1:23:17.532 --> 1:23:20.602
My client has no idea
what's going on

1:23:20.635 --> 1:23:25.305
or what he ate this morning, or
anything else you wanna ask him.

1:23:25.339 --> 1:23:27.575
Have we had enough pestering
for one day?

1:23:29.611 --> 1:23:31.245
Is this what you wanted?

1:23:31.278 --> 1:23:34.481
Thank you, Mr. Mattingly,
thank you.

1:23:34.516 --> 1:23:37.184
We'll be seeing you,
Mr. Capone.

1:23:46.393 --> 1:23:49.062
Yeah?

1:23:49.096 --> 1:23:50.698
<i>Collect call
from Cleveland.</i>

1:23:52.099 --> 1:23:53.835
Yeah.

1:23:56.203 --> 1:23:57.672
Hello?

1:24:01.743 --> 1:24:03.477
Hello?

1:24:04.812 --> 1:24:07.414
<i>I'm not gonna hang up.</i>

1:24:07.447 --> 1:24:09.383
<i>Hello?</i>

1:24:09.416 --> 1:24:10.552
Ok, I am gonna hang up.

1:24:10.585 --> 1:24:12.185
Is this Mae?

1:24:13.588 --> 1:24:15.122
Hello?

1:24:21.194 --> 1:24:23.263
Who is this?

1:24:24.699 --> 1:24:26.834
<i>Is this Tony?</i>

1:24:37.579 --> 1:24:38.646
<i>Mae!</i>

1:24:40.648 --> 1:24:41.849
<i>Mae!</i>

1:24:41.883 --> 1:24:43.818
What?

1:24:43.851 --> 1:24:46.688
You seen Fonse?

1:24:46.721 --> 1:24:49.189
No.

1:24:49.222 --> 1:24:51.191
I don't know where he is.

1:24:51.224 --> 1:24:52.192
I was with him-

1:24:52.225 --> 1:24:52.860
What're you talking about?

1:24:52.894 --> 1:24:53.795
I don't know where he went.

1:24:53.828 --> 1:24:55.329
I- I mean, he couldn't have
gone very far.

1:24:55.362 --> 1:24:56.564
Ralphie, you have to watch him.

1:24:56.598 --> 1:24:57.799
<i>Fonse?</i>

1:24:58.766 --> 1:24:59.801
<i>Hey, Fonse?</i>

1:24:59.834 --> 1:25:00.902
<i>Fonse?</i>

1:25:00.935 --> 1:25:01.769
<i>Fonse, where are you?</i>

1:25:01.803 --> 1:25:02.837
Pop?

1:25:02.870 --> 1:25:03.871

1:25:03.905 --> 1:25:05.372
<i>Fonse!</i>

1:25:05.405 --> 1:25:06.306
<i>Fonse?</i>

1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:07.274
Hey, pop!

1:25:07.307 --> 1:25:09.611
Hey, I looked at your pictures
today, bud.

1:25:09.644 --> 1:25:10.645
<i>Where are ya?</i>

1:25:10.678 --> 1:25:11.579
<i>Fonse?</i>

1:25:11.613 --> 1:25:12.814
I wanna tell ya what a...

1:25:12.847 --> 1:25:13.815
<i>Fonse!</i>

1:25:13.848 --> 1:25:14.816
What a great job you did.

1:25:14.849 --> 1:25:15.783
Fonse?

1:25:15.817 --> 1:25:16.684
Fonse?

1:25:16.718 --> 1:25:18.251
Honey?

1:25:18.886 --> 1:25:21.188
<i>Come on, Fonse.</i>

1:25:21.221 --> 1:25:23.825
<i>You better come out here
right now!</i>

1:25:23.858 --> 1:25:25.593
<i>Fonse, please!</i>

1:25:27.394 --> 1:25:28.529
Mr. Fonzo?

1:25:29.262 --> 1:25:30.865
<i>Honey?</i>

1:25:42.644 --> 1:25:44.679
Fonso.

1:25:44.712 --> 1:25:46.246
<i>You're scaring me, Fonse!</i>

1:25:48.415 --> 1:25:49.651
<i>Hey, Vincent, you got
a cigarette?</i>

1:25:49.684 --> 1:25:51.451
<i>Yeah, hold on.</i>

1:25:54.388 --> 1:25:55.288
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

1:26:02.730 --> 1:26:03.731
Come on!

1:26:03.765 --> 1:26:05.767
Open the gate!
Let's go! Let's go!

1:26:13.875 --> 1:26:15.910
<i>Alessandro, take Jimmy to head
off the other way,</i>

1:26:15.943 --> 1:26:17.411
<i>go to the East wing,
we'll check it.</i>

1:26:17.444 --> 1:26:18.412
<i>Down by the lake.</i>

1:26:18.445 --> 1:26:19.914
<i>...just sittin' there
like he always do!</i>

1:26:19.947 --> 1:26:21.616
<i>I'm gonna take another look
downstairs here.</i>

1:26:21.649 --> 1:26:23.751
<i>Tommy, you gotta go check
on the other side.</i>

1:26:23.785 --> 1:26:24.585
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1:26:24.619 --> 1:26:25.820
<i>Go down by the water.</i>

1:26:25.853 --> 1:26:27.055
<i>I already looked there.</i>

1:26:27.088 --> 1:26:29.456
<i>Check all the bathrooms. Rosie,
check the ones downstairs.</i>

1:26:29.489 --> 1:26:31.291
<i>I don't know where
the fuck he is!</i>

1:26:32.459 --> 1:26:34.629
<i>Ralphie was outside with him
and then he lost him.</i>

1:26:34.662 --> 1:26:36.664
<i>Rosie, are you sure he's not
up there?</i>

1:26:40.300 --> 1:26:41.736
<i>There's a hundred guys here
at the house.</i>

1:26:41.769 --> 1:26:43.971
<i>How could somebody not know
where the hell he is?</i>

1:26:44.005 --> 1:26:45.840
<i>I don't know how anybody
could lose him!</i>

1:26:58.853 --> 1:26:59.921
<i>Stop him, Gino!</i>

1:27:31.018 --> 1:27:32.787
Eh.

Take this.

1:27:50.838 --> 1:27:52.840
<i>I'm comin' out, Fonse!</i>

You're gonna be ok.

1:32:50.838 --> 1:32:54.642
<i>Lie back. Please lie back.
Try to relax.</i>

1:32:54.675 --> 1:32:57.178
<i>It's going to be alright.
Get him up.</i>

1:35:04.972 --> 1:35:06.307
<i>See ya, Gino!</i>

1:35:43.477 --> 1:35:46.947
<i>So Vince, what're you
thankful for?</i>

1:35:46.981 --> 1:35:48.882
My front teeth.

1:35:50.417 --> 1:35:53.087
<i>Gaby?</i>

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:57.157
I'm thankful for my new puppy,
Eugene.

<i>Berta.</i>

1:36:06.601 --> 1:36:08.969
I'm thankful for grandpa Fonse.

Fonse.

1:36:55.182 --> 1:36:57.284
You got a visitor.

Come on.

1:37:04.358 --> 1:37:06.393
I'll let you two have
some time together.

1:37:06.427 --> 1:37:07.562
Thank you, Mae.
