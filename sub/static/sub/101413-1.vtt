00:33.658 --> 00:35.928
<i>Love... Loving...</i>

00:35.962 --> 00:40.565
<i>Okay, yep. Good. Slower. Love...</i>

00:41.700 --> 00:43.535
<i>Loving... That's the secret.</i>

00:43.568 --> 00:45.972
<i>That's the only thing.</i>

00:46.005 --> 00:49.942
<i>Because everyone wants to find their one,
their "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."</i>

00:51.643 --> 00:53.445
<i>Because everyone wants
to find their one.</i>

00:53.478 --> 00:55.047
<i>Their "Lucy in the Sky
with Diamonds"</i>

00:55.081 --> 00:57.950
<i>with tangerine trees
and marmalade skies.</i>

00:59.651 --> 01:01.854
<i>Because that's the dream. Right?</i>

01:06.726 --> 01:09.561
<i>Useless, pathetic...</i>

01:09.594 --> 01:12.397
<i>Don't listen to her, kid.
You're a shining star.</i>

01:16.468 --> 01:20.907
Love, love, loving.

01:21.974 --> 01:24.709
That's the question. And it's the
motherfucking answer... Oh, shit.

01:24.744 --> 01:25.644
Sorry.

01:27.113 --> 01:28.748
I want to see you
swallow them.

01:28.781 --> 01:30.582
Nicky, come on. Really?
You don't seriously...

01:30.615 --> 01:33.485
We had a deal. No drinking.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.656
Jeepers, you're like the
Brother-nator tonight, I love it.

01:37.689 --> 01:40.126
Darling,
we can take him back now.

01:40.159 --> 01:41.828
Your dad's exhausted as it is.

01:41.861 --> 01:43.395
Uncle Ivan said
he could take him.

01:43.428 --> 01:45.430
Guys, guys. I'm right here.

01:45.463 --> 01:47.934
- Ivan can't, he's got the poodles.
- Family, chillax!

01:47.967 --> 01:52.504
Please. I'm calm now for reals and my band's
all set to play your song; my gift to you!

01:52.537 --> 01:54.073
I gotta give you my gift, right?

01:58.177 --> 01:59.477
Okay.

02:00.847 --> 02:02.581
Hi, me again.

02:02.614 --> 02:04.951
We are
They Said It Wouldn't Last...

02:04.984 --> 02:07.719
Which bears no
relation to today's events.

02:09.188 --> 02:10.790

Whoa, whoa. That... that...
that was a moment.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.750
That... that was amazing,
did you feel that?

03:44.784 --> 03:47.053
Man, it's so, so hot in this tent.
Do you guys feel the hot...

03:47.086 --> 03:49.487
Does anyone else feel hot
in this tent, because...

03:49.521 --> 03:53.125
Did you feel? No, no. Stop.
Stop, stop. Stop. Stop.

03:53.159 --> 03:56.062
Let's just live in this moment.

03:56.095 --> 04:00.199
We don't need music or sounds to connect,
to feel the overpowering love in this...

04:00.232 --> 04:02.001
- Hey, man, let's just take five...
- No, no.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.676
I love you, Nicky.

04:14.713 --> 04:19.285
And it's just such a monumental thing,
you know, it's such a huge leap of courage.

04:19.318 --> 04:22.755
And... and if you'll let me,
I just...

04:24.090 --> 04:26.491
I really want to share
with you...

04:28.094 --> 04:30.562
all... all the love
I have inside me.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.200
- Devon!
- No, no, it's okay. It's okay, because...

04:34.233 --> 04:35.301
Devon!

04:35.334 --> 04:39.537
I am love.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.607
No! Devon!

04:45.577 --> 04:49.815
<i>As John Lennon once said,
"Reality leaves a lot to the imagination."</i>

04:49.849 --> 04:52.885
<i>And for me, that's the truth.</i>

04:52.918 --> 04:59.557
<i>But maybe I'm the lucky one, because
sometimes reality can really, really suck.</i>

05:00.960 --> 05:03.195
No, no! My life-blood is sacred!

05:03.229 --> 05:05.697
- Please. Sacred. You're evil.
- <i>Dirty... Disgusting...</i>

05:05.731 --> 05:09.268
- I'm pure. Pure as an angel. Don't. Don't.
- <i>Evil... Putrid... Demented.</i>

05:09.301 --> 05:11.636
I'm sacred.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.702
I don't think
this is a very good idea.

05:44.737 --> 05:46.906
I want to go, now, okay?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.311
Where's my brother?
Where's Nicky?

06:14.100 --> 06:17.269
Paint is healing.

06:18.971 --> 06:23.175
The color, the sensation.

06:23.209 --> 06:24.810
It feels natural.

06:26.445 --> 06:30.783
<i>I was 12 when
I first heard them, the voices.</i>

06:30.816 --> 06:32.284
<i>One was friendly.</i>

06:32.318 --> 06:36.755
<i>That was Mr. Rocket,
my protector, my hero.</i>

06:36.789 --> 06:40.658
<i>The other, Miss Needles,
was not.</i>

06:44.930 --> 06:49.068
<i>It's why they want to keep me constantly
medicated, to lock out the bad.</i>

06:50.870 --> 06:55.074
<i>Problem is, it can sometimes
lock out everything.</i>

07:23.469 --> 07:24.370
Ooh...

07:37.516 --> 07:39.018
Devon?

07:44.523 --> 07:48.861
No. I'm asleep. Go away.

07:48.894 --> 07:53.899
- Up and at 'em.
- No, it's not tomorrow yet.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.901
Mate, what happened here?

07:55.935 --> 07:59.471
Oh, there was a shaft of light,
like I was a stranded ship.

08:02.775 --> 08:04.143
Is that decaf?

08:04.176 --> 08:06.812
There is no caffeine
in the house. Remember?

08:09.882 --> 08:10.783
Yeah.

08:12.084 --> 08:14.920
Yeah, but what if Liv,
not intentionally, but inadvertently,

08:14.954 --> 08:17.923
brought some in from school,
because that smells like caffeine...

08:17.957 --> 08:19.158
Morning, Dev.

08:19.191 --> 08:21.093
Hey, sis,
how's the growing fetus?

08:21.126 --> 08:22.828
Yeah, well, it's, you know.

08:22.861 --> 08:24.964
Hey, and I heard you
throwing up again. You okay?

08:24.997 --> 08:28.901
Oh, yeah, I managed to get three
whole crackers down first this time.

08:30.169 --> 08:33.138
- Are we all good here?
- Yeah. Yeah, all good.

08:33.172 --> 08:34.506
Good. Okay.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.041
- Well, what was that?
- Nothing.

08:36.075 --> 08:38.043
Come on, we're leaving in 15.

08:38.077 --> 08:40.012
Pet Patch.

08:42.081 --> 08:44.817
Hey. Loser birds. Move!

08:45.584 --> 08:47.419
- Are you dead? Huh?
- Hey!

08:48.988 --> 08:51.290
- Do something!
- That's it, piss off, right now.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.825
It's okay, guys.
Don't worry about it.

08:52.858 --> 08:54.326
- Loser birds.
- Don't do that!

08:54.360 --> 08:55.628
Is everything okay?

08:55.661 --> 08:57.429
- No, it's really not, is this yours?
- Devon.

08:57.463 --> 08:59.031
Can you clean out the litters?

08:59.064 --> 09:00.332
Yeah, but this little turd was...

09:00.366 --> 09:03.435
- Excuse me?
- Now, okay? Thank you.

09:03.469 --> 09:05.037
Turd!

09:05.070 --> 09:08.274
- I'm sorry about that, he's new.
- Okay, well.

09:08.307 --> 09:10.109
Let me make it up to you.

09:10.142 --> 09:13.045
We could throw in the budgie
with the large enclosure.

09:13.078 --> 09:14.813
- My God!
- How would that feel?

09:14.847 --> 09:16.181
Quick! Go, go!

09:16.215 --> 09:17.349
- Be free.
- Devon! No!

09:17.383 --> 09:18.517
He was a bully!

09:18.550 --> 09:20.052
And nobody should pay for them,
they're not commodities,

09:20.085 --> 09:22.554
- even though she was just going to give it away like...
- It is a pet shop!

09:22.588 --> 09:24.857
A "shop".

09:24.890 --> 09:27.493
And it was a job which I'm probably
going to be needing myself now

09:27.526 --> 09:29.995
after skipping out
on another open house.

09:30.029 --> 09:32.865
Oh, so I should just sell my soul?
Ignore blatant animal cruelty?

09:33.999 --> 09:35.367
Jesus Christ.

09:37.102 --> 09:39.138
Where are we? Is this a prison?

09:39.171 --> 09:41.140
- It is not a prison.
- It looks like a prison.

09:42.274 --> 09:43.842
Devon, come on.

09:51.183 --> 09:55.020
I thought you sold houses, because this is
like a shed, and in a questionable area.

09:55.054 --> 09:58.157
It is a solid, safe apartment,
with great appliances.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.958
- Mm-hm.
- And um...

10:01.660 --> 10:02.961
Well, look at this.

10:06.899 --> 10:10.069
See? That's total darkness.

10:10.102 --> 10:15.641
Yeah, that's... Are we moving?
Here? With the baby?

10:15.674 --> 10:17.176
Because this is...

10:20.446 --> 10:22.548
Oh, not "we."

10:22.581 --> 10:26.518
Just... Yeah. No.

10:26.552 --> 10:28.120
- Hey.
- No.

10:28.153 --> 10:31.523
Devon. Hey, stop, okay.
You... you can do this.

10:31.557 --> 10:34.493
I got a great deal on the rent, all you
have to worry about is paying me back

10:34.526 --> 10:36.595
when you get another job.

10:36.628 --> 10:40.099
I can't be on my own, in here,
with my condition. Are you crazy?

10:40.132 --> 10:41.934
Well, look, I'm exactly
ten minutes down the road.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.936
And if you just stay on plan,
you could...

10:43.969 --> 10:45.404
You don't want me
around the baby. Right?

10:48.340 --> 10:53.612
Right?
You think that I'd... hurt it?

10:53.645 --> 10:55.481
No, of course,
I... I don't think that.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.649
Of course, I don't think that.

10:57.683 --> 10:59.218
Devon, I...

11:08.394 --> 11:10.329
Yo, yo, yo. Check it out.

11:10.362 --> 11:13.165
The Ken doll suit, the trim.
Reel it in.

11:13.198 --> 11:15.467
Devon.

11:15.501 --> 11:19.204
- Um, what are you doing here?
- I know. I've been AWOL.

11:19.238 --> 11:22.508
But now, I'm back
with a musical vengeance and...

11:22.541 --> 11:24.209
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Devon. Hi.

11:24.243 --> 11:27.146
- Oh, please don't...
- And you're sticky. Sorry.

11:27.179 --> 11:28.714
It's so... so lovely
to meet you.

11:28.748 --> 11:31.083
Yeah, this is, um...
this is Kate.

11:31.116 --> 11:33.452
You met her twice
when you were at the clinic.

11:35.421 --> 11:39.091
Kate. Kat. Kitty-cat. Kat.

11:40.727 --> 11:43.328
We... we were actually
just heading off.

11:43.362 --> 11:45.564
- Um, I've got a work dinner, and...
- Yes. No, it's cool.

11:45.597 --> 11:47.332
I could chill,
work on some new tracks.

11:47.366 --> 11:48.700
Man, I've got some great
new tunes bubbling away...

11:48.735 --> 11:50.536
No, man,
I'm... I'm not playing anymore.

11:50.569 --> 11:54.072
What? No. What... what are you
talking about?

11:55.775 --> 11:59.378
The band's dead, dude,
it's over.

12:01.146 --> 12:02.481
It's time to grow up.

12:02.514 --> 12:06.051
Bullshit. Bullshit.

12:07.553 --> 12:12.157
Anyway, uh, hoping I could just nestle
into your couch for a day or two, tops.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.426
- You wouldn't even know I was there.
- No!

12:14.460 --> 12:19.298
Yeah, uh... yeah,
sorry, I can't.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.702
Just look after yourself, yeah?

12:24.636 --> 12:26.271
Um, yeah.

12:27.573 --> 12:30.309
<i>Nobody wants you...</i>

12:30.342 --> 12:32.544
<i>You suck the life
out of everyone...</i>

12:32.578 --> 12:34.613
<i>You wear everyone down...</i>

12:34.646 --> 12:37.182
<i>Nobody wants you around...
You're a burden.</i>

12:37.216 --> 12:39.151
<i>They all wish you were dead...</i>

12:46.358 --> 12:48.093
<i>Do it...</i>

12:48.126 --> 12:49.428
Fuck it.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.066
<i>Hey, kid,
what's the big hurry?</i>

12:56.668 --> 13:00.539
<i>Not loving this mood
you're in, D-Man. Hang on!</i>

13:00.572 --> 13:02.207
<i>Olivia hates you...</i>

13:02.241 --> 13:04.042
<i>You know
what you need to do...</i>

13:04.076 --> 13:06.178
<i>Nobody wants you around.
Nobody loves you.</i>

13:06.211 --> 13:07.780
<i>There's only one solution.
You deserve to die.</i>

13:07.814 --> 13:10.582
<i>Your parents will
finally be free...</i>

13:10.616 --> 13:13.252
<i>You're going to hurt the baby...
the baby... Saved from your disease...</i>

13:52.759 --> 13:56.695
Hey, back up, that's far enough.

13:57.830 --> 14:02.467
Come on. We got to hang out together
more, see, that's the problem.

14:02.501 --> 14:06.138
Kick back, have a few bevvies,
chase a little tail.

14:07.339 --> 14:10.810
I'm worthless, I'm no good.

14:10.843 --> 14:15.647
That's crapola, you're a champion,
you're a bloody superhero.

14:15.681 --> 14:17.817
<i>Just do it,
you worthless runt.</i>

14:17.850 --> 14:22.321
Hey, hey, hey. Stay with me.
You're a halo of awesome.

14:22.354 --> 14:25.758
You're a frickin' legend, man!

14:25.792 --> 14:28.861
<i>Jump... Loser...
Do it... No one will miss you...</i>

14:28.895 --> 14:31.263
You're an absolute rock star.

14:33.198 --> 14:35.534
Eh? Hey.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.502
Whoa. Shit.

15:25.617 --> 15:26.853
That was beautiful.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.286
- Oh, God!
- Sorry!

15:28.320 --> 15:30.489
Sorry, I didn't mean...
Oh, jeez.

15:33.993 --> 15:36.294
Are you okay?

15:36.328 --> 15:38.865
Uh, I'm not sure.

15:38.898 --> 15:43.770
Yeah. I... I didn't think you were going
to wake up, I mean, not immediately.

15:43.803 --> 15:45.938
Not that I thought you were dead
or anything,

15:45.972 --> 15:48.975
you were definitely breathing,
strong pulse, so you seemed okay...

15:49.008 --> 15:52.745
um, apart from actually
the light bleeding.

15:52.779 --> 15:59.384
That's... that's why I thought the
bathtub was... was the best place for you.

15:59.418 --> 16:00.987
I'm... I'm renting.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.487
Oh, I'm Devon.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.728
Hey, uh, I'm Lucy.

16:15.500 --> 16:20.205
Um, I'm gonna go, uh...
I'm gonna go put some... some clothes on.

16:21.406 --> 16:23.675
I will... Yeah.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.957
So, you found me?

16:37.990 --> 16:43.796
Ah, well, no, actually Milo
did, my, uh... my little Spaceman,

16:43.830 --> 16:47.800
sometimes Cowardly Lion,
or Bumblebee.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.501
He's the one to thank.

16:49.534 --> 16:54.406
Spacedog. Hey. Hey.

16:56.508 --> 16:59.746
And how did you...
If I was out of it?

16:59.779 --> 17:05.017
I'm surprisingly strong.
Good deltoids, I guess.

17:05.051 --> 17:09.287
I... I also live just over from the park
so I didn't have to drag you too far.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.523
Sorry, I... I did try
to be gentle.

17:11.556 --> 17:16.528
It was just the stairs that, uh...
that seemed kind of painful.

17:16.561 --> 17:17.662
Cool.

17:24.369 --> 17:27.672
Oh, yes. I know, it's a lot.

17:28.707 --> 17:31.878
It's for work,
a '50s American-themed diner.

17:35.815 --> 17:37.884
Would you like some coffee?

17:37.917 --> 17:41.319
Although, disclaimer: only have decaf,
I love the ritual and the aroma,

17:41.353 --> 17:44.957
but the actual like force of caffeine
just like throttles me, you know?

17:44.991 --> 17:46.291
Yes, exactly.

17:47.794 --> 17:49.628
Oh, yeah, I'd... I'd love some.

17:49.661 --> 17:51.596
Cool. Good. Yeah, coffee.

17:55.868 --> 17:57.369
So you were trying
to kill yourself?

18:00.505 --> 18:03.508
I'm sorry, that...
that was too direct.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.077
I'm always...
I'm always too direct.

18:05.111 --> 18:08.748
Yeah, no, uh,
there's been some issues.

18:08.781 --> 18:11.383
Enough said.

18:11.416 --> 18:14.954
Although, I will say, you are one hardy
son-of-a-bitch to be up and walking around

18:14.987 --> 18:16.521
after a fall like that.

18:17.489 --> 18:19.959
Oh, no! My guitar.

18:19.992 --> 18:21.459
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

18:21.493 --> 18:23.495
I took a peek,
hope you don't mind.

18:25.597 --> 18:26.866
Not a scratch.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.634
Oh, thank God, it's okay.

18:29.668 --> 18:31.871
Are you a musician?

18:31.904 --> 18:35.107
Oh, you have incredible
collection, by the way,

18:35.141 --> 18:38.878
and isn't vinyl so much more
authentic; honest, you know?

18:38.911 --> 18:42.547
- Sorry, yes.
- You know what, don't answer that.

18:42.581 --> 18:45.617
Why do we always do that?
Exchange resumes.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.854
It just reduces our lives
to ants, you know?

18:47.887 --> 18:51.858
Just toiling for the man;
the man-Queen.

18:51.891 --> 18:53.726
Yeah, sure. I guess.

18:55.962 --> 18:57.495
And we are so much more
than that.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.608
You know what, Devon...

19:13.079 --> 19:19.684
I don't know what your plans are, or if
you're even sticking around another day,

19:19.718 --> 19:25.423
I mean, I'm not going to preach to
you, you know, life is what it is.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.559
I don't have any
immediate plans.

19:29.095 --> 19:31.429
Really? Okay. Great.

19:31.463 --> 19:37.103
Well, uh, do you want to do
something? With me? Together?

19:39.238 --> 19:40.672
I'd love that.

19:41.874 --> 19:47.813
Awesome. Uh, well, give me
two minutes to erase Marilyn.

19:48.713 --> 19:53.920
Lucy. Thank you.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.560
I adore Perth;
you can breathe here.

20:02.594 --> 20:06.165
It's like the most isolated
big city on earth.

20:06.198 --> 20:07.934
You can feel it.

20:07.967 --> 20:12.604
But Sydney,
God, if I was anywhere else.

20:12.637 --> 20:14.907
- I've never been, actually.
- What?

20:14.941 --> 20:20.478
That is criminal, the harbor,
the cultures, the food, it's pulsing.

20:20.512 --> 20:26.018
Even from the tranquility of Hyde Park,
you can still feel the city humming,

20:26.052 --> 20:29.487
seducing you
with its magical past.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.924
I'm trying to say you have to go.

20:31.958 --> 20:33.525
Is that where you're from?

20:33.558 --> 20:35.795
Ah, no, originally I'm...

20:37.797 --> 20:40.967
You know what, let's not
do that, talk about our pasts.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.636
It's essentially irrelevant
information, don't you think?

20:45.704 --> 20:47.572
I guess. Yeah.

20:47.605 --> 20:50.642
I just want to know everything
about you now, today,

20:50.675 --> 20:54.612
in this moment,
where we're both meant to be.

20:54.646 --> 20:59.185
Like, are you hungry?

20:59.218 --> 21:02.054
- Yes, yes, I am.
- Perfect.

21:02.088 --> 21:03.756
What do you feel like?

21:03.789 --> 21:05.623
Well, considering
I'm almost broke, I feel like...

21:05.657 --> 21:09.228
No, I said
what do you feel like.

21:11.097 --> 21:15.600
Ah. Okay, I feel like a giant
lobster and fresh scallops,

21:15.633 --> 21:19.305
some crusty warm bread with butter on
it, and ice cold champagne,

21:19.338 --> 21:21.140
even though I don't
really drink champagne.

21:21.173 --> 21:25.177
Oh, God, you are inside my head!
That is the perfect meal.

21:26.879 --> 21:29.547
Lucy, um...

21:31.350 --> 21:34.086
- Lucy.
- Trust me, it's okay.

21:35.321 --> 21:40.726
Man, I love seafood. I feel like I must
have been a mermaid in a former life.

21:40.760 --> 21:41.794
Or a whale.

21:41.827 --> 21:43.129
Welcome to Blue Horizon.

21:44.629 --> 21:45.931
Sir, can I take your guitar?

21:45.965 --> 21:49.534
No, no. No. Thank you.
Keeps me safe.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.311
This is a symphony.

21:59.345 --> 22:01.546
What did I tell you?

22:04.884 --> 22:06.752
What?
Is there something on my face?

22:07.953 --> 22:10.756
I've been trying to work it out,
who it is you remind me of.

22:11.857 --> 22:17.296
An old movie star? Or that hot P.E.
teacher you fantasized about?

22:18.397 --> 22:22.168
It's like you're from a fairy-tale.
Like I've dreamt you.

22:23.202 --> 22:26.072
Cool.
Except I'm a lot more wicked...

22:27.807 --> 22:29.775
All right,
are you ready to roll?

22:30.876 --> 22:33.012
- I don't know how to thank you.
- You don't have to.

22:33.045 --> 22:34.180
It's on them.

22:35.647 --> 22:39.985
I mean, I'm sure they're doing okay
and this is a very special occasion.

22:40.019 --> 22:41.287
They won't even notice...

22:42.988 --> 22:45.257
Hey, lean in.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.194
That's it...

22:49.361 --> 22:56.869
Now, breathe in and out...

23:00.039 --> 23:02.775
Breathe in...

23:05.411 --> 23:06.912
Out.

23:36.242 --> 23:37.642
Shall we?

23:42.381 --> 23:46.886
Hello. Thank you.

24:13.412 --> 24:18.284
I feel like
this is the perfect arena.

24:18.317 --> 24:19.451
Go on.

24:25.224 --> 24:26.225
Yeah.

24:28.027 --> 24:33.899
Okay, this is a song
that I'm yet to write...

24:33.933 --> 24:35.401
Mm-Hm.

24:35.434 --> 24:38.170

- Really?

26:22.374 --> 26:23.909
Yes.

26:23.942 --> 26:25.411
Because I actually haven't
played in ages,

26:25.444 --> 26:28.914
and lately when I'm playing
I kind of sound like...

26:44.463 --> 26:45.230
What?

26:46.565 --> 26:49.268
Tangerine trees
and marmalade skies.

27:05.184 --> 27:07.086
Okay, I got it.

27:07.119 --> 27:10.856
No. Over. Over.
It's all coming off.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.861
Dress, yep.

27:27.573 --> 27:32.144
<i>♪ I remember you ♪</i>

27:35.614 --> 27:39.985
It's like I'm finally awake,
after years.

27:42.187 --> 27:44.156
Why were you sleeping?

27:45.357 --> 27:48.560
- I kind of had an accident.
- Mm?

27:51.463 --> 27:58.437
And I "hid out"
for a long time after...

28:00.038 --> 28:01.306
in a black hole.

28:06.612 --> 28:12.284
But now you're here.
With me. Right?

28:12.317 --> 28:14.486
- Yeah.
- Mm-Hm.

28:30.436 --> 28:31.336
Ah...

28:32.504 --> 28:38.310
- That's beautiful.
- It's to remind me that I'm free.

28:40.579 --> 28:43.315
For a while, I wasn't, so...

28:45.752 --> 28:47.019
I love you.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.956
Everything about you.

28:52.090 --> 28:56.261
Really?

28:58.096 --> 29:00.966
Yeah. I do. Completely.

29:02.267 --> 29:03.402
Good.

29:48.180 --> 29:51.784
- Anything?
- No.

29:53.719 --> 29:58.056
Your mom just called, and they
haven't heard from him either.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.262
Oh. Where the hell is he?

30:04.496 --> 30:06.799
Nicholas Cassidy!

30:06.833 --> 30:11.403
It is I! Your Warrior of Light!
Your Shepherd of Dreams!!

30:11.436 --> 30:15.407
- I come bearing wondrous news! An enchanting tale of hope and...
- Okay, shhh, okay, calm down.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.509
Just big, big breaths.

30:17.543 --> 30:21.079
Nick, Nick, Nicky, it's alright,
everything's going to be okay now.

30:21.113 --> 30:22.447
What? What the hell happened?

30:22.481 --> 30:24.116
Oh, yeah,
they were slowing me down.

30:24.149 --> 30:25.818
But... but I'm great, honestly,
and... Hey, Liv.

30:25.852 --> 30:29.087
- Hey.
- It's all because of her. She saved me!

30:29.121 --> 30:31.590
So we planned for you
to meet her.

30:31.623 --> 30:34.761
She suggested this amazing Thai place and you
know how much I adore Thai, and guess what?

30:34.794 --> 30:37.629
She does too.
How perfect is that?

30:39.766 --> 30:45.270
Hey, uh, Devon. Dev, um,
I'm sorry if we made you feel unwelcome.

30:45.304 --> 30:47.306
It wasn't the intention.

30:47.339 --> 30:49.408
Oh, yeah, it's all good.
I get it.

30:50.442 --> 30:52.611
And that place is lovely.

30:52.644 --> 30:55.113
So thank you, but Lucy and me will
probably want to cohabitate ASAP, so...

30:58.450 --> 31:00.152
Uh, okay.

31:00.185 --> 31:05.290
Well, I guess
I'll see you guys later. Yeah?

31:05.324 --> 31:08.527
- Yes, you will.
- Good luck.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.163
- Go, mold some young minds.
- Bye.

31:17.235 --> 31:20.439
Hey, when was the last time
that you took a shower?

31:20.472 --> 31:22.742
You know I can't.
It's like flying, it's unnatural.

31:22.775 --> 31:23.910
It's the most natural thing.

31:23.943 --> 31:26.545
Yeah, in a womb, maybe.

31:26.578 --> 31:29.414
Not under a hose, in a box, with it all
rushing down that tiny little hole into...

31:30.682 --> 31:31.583
who knows what?

31:32.952 --> 31:35.287
Thanks.

31:38.490 --> 31:43.328
She is like pure sunlight.
Like an explosion of honey and violins.

31:43.362 --> 31:47.734
And.... and her voice, oh, my God,
she sung this lullaby all in French.

31:51.236 --> 31:53.740
Like a dream, you know.

31:53.773 --> 31:57.409
And she has this adorable little dog called Milo,
who's a real live spaceman or a bumblebee,

31:57.442 --> 32:00.312
- or sometimes a cowardly lion.
- Mm-Hm.

32:00.345 --> 32:01.848
And she doesn't even have
a phone, you know.

32:01.881 --> 32:04.349
In today's world,
probably the only one.

32:04.383 --> 32:05.785
Just wants to be free, you know?

32:05.818 --> 32:06.953
- Like the eagle on her back.
- Devon.

32:06.986 --> 32:08.520
It's been way over an hour.

32:08.553 --> 32:11.390
You're hungry. Let's get some tom yum
to tide you over until she gets here...

32:11.423 --> 32:12.624
Excuse me? Waiter?

32:12.658 --> 32:14.827
Devon, if she doesn't come,
it's not the end of the world.

32:14.861 --> 32:16.461
And we didn't even talk about
our pasts, you know.

32:16.495 --> 32:17.830
We just existed in the moment,
in the present...

32:17.864 --> 32:20.900
Come on. Let's...
let's call this a night.

32:22.534 --> 32:25.370
Maybe... maybe...
maybe something happened to her.

32:25.404 --> 32:26.672
- Stay calm.
- No.

32:26.705 --> 32:27.807
- Devon.
- Oh, no. No. No.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.909
- Relax. Devon.
- No. No. No, no, I need to find her.

32:29.942 --> 32:32.678
- I need to find her.
- Just... Shit! God.

32:32.711 --> 32:36.248
This is it. This is it.
I think this is it. Yes.

32:36.281 --> 32:38.316
Uh...

32:38.350 --> 32:40.686
- I can't remember. Why can't I remember...
- It's... it's okay.

32:40.719 --> 32:43.923
- Do you know what floor?
- High, high. The highest floor. Hi.

32:43.956 --> 32:46.859
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hey! Devon!

32:46.893 --> 32:49.661
There is a lift, you know.
Devon.

32:52.431 --> 32:56.568
This is it! This is the door.
Please be home, please be home.

32:58.537 --> 33:00.907
Lucy, it's me! Devon!.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.475
- Hey, dickhead! My kid's sleeping!
- Hi!

33:03.508 --> 33:05.812
Do you know Lucy? She lives here,
and I'm really, really worried about her.

33:05.845 --> 33:08.380
No, I don't know Lucy, all right,
and if you don't piss off in two seconds...

33:08.413 --> 33:09.314
- Lucy?
- What did I just tell you?

33:09.347 --> 33:10.649
I'm really sorry.
But could you just...

33:10.682 --> 33:11.884
Devon.

33:12.985 --> 33:16.488
- Lucy?
- Maybe this isn't the right one.

33:17.422 --> 33:20.258
This was the bath,
this was where I woke up.

33:20.292 --> 33:21.761
Okay. Okay.

33:22.995 --> 33:24.931
Maybe she doesn't want
to be found.

33:24.964 --> 33:27.900
What? What are you...
No, no, she loves me.

33:27.934 --> 33:29.434
Oh, my God,
what happened to her?

33:29.468 --> 33:31.871
- Stay calm. Stay calm. Okay?
- Lucy.

33:31.904 --> 33:34.406
What about her surname?
You know, we could look her up.

33:35.373 --> 33:40.512
- Uh, she never told me. Lucy, it was just Lucy.
- Right.

33:40.545 --> 33:41.613
- The restaurant!
- Okay.

33:41.646 --> 33:43.216
She... she took me for seafood
down by the river.

33:43.248 --> 33:46.485
Okay, well, then they'd have a record of
her surname, yeah, if she paid by card.

33:46.518 --> 33:48.054
Did she pay by card?

33:48.087 --> 33:50.489
No. We... we didn't.

33:51.791 --> 33:53.926
- Oh, shit, they've got her.
- Stay calm. Stay calm.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.661
No one... no one's done anything wrong,
it's all right. It doesn't matter.

33:56.695 --> 33:58.597
What the?

33:58.630 --> 34:01.700
It's her, she's here;
they're listening.

34:01.734 --> 34:04.871
Lucy was too pure. She was
an angel. Lucy was too good.

34:04.904 --> 34:07.405
- Stop.
- What have you done with her?

34:07.439 --> 34:09.742
<i>She ran for her life,
you stupid fool. She never loved you.</i>

34:09.776 --> 34:11.643
She's an angel.

34:11.676 --> 34:13.378
<i>No one could ever
love you. She's gone.</i>

34:13.411 --> 34:15.614
She's not real.
Miss Needles is not real.

34:15.647 --> 34:17.382
- <i>She's gone.</i>
- Devon, she's not here. She's not here...

34:17.415 --> 34:19.484
- Get out!
- <i>Insane...</i>

34:19.518 --> 34:21.854
- Get out!
- No one's saying anything. I'm right here. I'm right here.

34:21.888 --> 34:23.655
I haven't done anything.
Devon, breathe.

34:23.688 --> 34:25.724
You... you're part of this.

34:25.758 --> 34:27.827
You're the one that told them
where she was. You're part of this.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.962
- You wanted her gone!
- Devon. Devon. I love you.

34:29.996 --> 34:33.065
- Devon! Devon!
- Get off me! You fucking traitor!

34:33.099 --> 34:35.634
- Devon!
- You fucking traitor!

34:35.667 --> 34:36.969
Devon! Just...

34:38.237 --> 34:41.974
- <i>Run... Run...</i>
- Devon! Stop, mate. Stop.

34:42.008 --> 34:46.611
- <i>Run... Run!</i>
- Devon! No, no, no, no...

34:47.980 --> 34:49.447
Fuck!

34:49.481 --> 34:51.383
- Oh, my God!
- Devon!

34:51.416 --> 34:53.853
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- You all right? You okay?

34:53.886 --> 34:55.922
- Stand back!
- No... He's okay.

34:55.955 --> 34:58.590
- How do you say, he might be pretty hurt.
- Devon!

34:58.623 --> 35:01.727
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

35:01.761 --> 35:03.562
Get out. Devon.

35:05.998 --> 35:08.366
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

35:08.400 --> 35:11.771
Get off me! Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

35:11.804 --> 35:14.506
Get off me!
Get the... get the fuck off me.

35:14.539 --> 35:16.776
- Devon.
- Get off me!

35:16.809 --> 35:21.781
Breathe, Devon, breathe. Devon,
just breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe.

35:21.814 --> 35:25.952
Devon, breathe.
I got you. I got you.

35:25.985 --> 35:29.654
You're fine. I got you.

35:45.972 --> 35:49.608
<i>Conditions have been very
unseasonable for this time of year</i>

35:49.641 --> 35:53.913
<i>and this massive, complex low pressure
system will see temperatures dropping</i>

35:53.946 --> 35:57.083
<i>and bringing rain,
high winds and even hail...</i>

36:03.722 --> 36:06.625
<i>Hey. Devon?</i>

36:11.931 --> 36:13.531
<i>Are you okay?</i>

36:15.268 --> 36:18.470
<i>And this could stay with us right
through to the end of this week.</i>

36:21.941 --> 36:24.576
The last time
we talked, we agreed that

36:24.609 --> 36:27.146
Mr. Rocket and Miss Needles
weren't real.

36:27.179 --> 36:29.581
You remember saying that, right?

36:31.650 --> 36:37.056
So, maybe, as real as Lucy
seemed, she's just like them?

36:39.792 --> 36:41.693
Do you think
that might be a possibility?

36:47.499 --> 36:49.701
- Patricia?
- Yeah.

36:53.272 --> 36:55.074
Have you ever loved somebody?

36:58.576 --> 36:59.912
Like really loved them?

37:01.948 --> 37:04.649
The feeling that gets under your
skin and seeps into your bones

37:04.683 --> 37:08.687
and makes your whole body ache like a
gigantic orgasm you'll never ever reach.

37:09.755 --> 37:10.990
That feeling?

37:16.661 --> 37:17.863
You'd know it if you had.

37:20.099 --> 37:22.735
Listen, um, I don't know
how to tell you this,

37:22.768 --> 37:25.503
but I went to a couple
of '50s style cafes,

37:25.537 --> 37:27.873
because you said that she worked
there as Marilyn Monroe.

37:27.907 --> 37:31.844
- So I... I... yesterday...
- Thank you, thank you.

37:31.877 --> 37:34.612
And, yeah, it turns
you're right, although...

37:36.115 --> 37:38.784
I guess she didn't want to lead
you on, because she's married.

37:40.086 --> 37:41.053
I'm sorry.

37:42.221 --> 37:44.957
But from what she told me,
she thinks the world of you.

37:49.261 --> 37:52.064
- Why would you do that?
- I wanted to help.

37:53.132 --> 37:54.867
Why... why would you lie to me?

37:57.569 --> 38:00.272
She is real, she's as real as you and
I, and if she isn't then...

38:01.841 --> 38:02.842
Then...

38:06.345 --> 38:10.715
Dev, what do you want me to say?

38:10.750 --> 38:13.052
Her place was empty
because it wasn't her place.

38:13.085 --> 38:16.654
And you didn't pay at the restaurant
because... because you never went there.

38:16.688 --> 38:18.723
She didn't come to the Thai
place because she doesn't exist.

38:18.758 --> 38:22.194
And... and if you don't see
that, I don't get, what choice?

38:22.228 --> 38:24.196
No.

38:24.230 --> 38:26.332
I can't go back into the clinic, Nick.
I will drown in there.

38:26.365 --> 38:30.036
Okay. Well, then, you have
to try and get better.

38:30.069 --> 38:33.538
Because I... I don't see any other options.

38:46.085 --> 38:51.689
You save an entire
family from a blazing inferno

38:51.723 --> 38:53.759
and what thanks do you get?

38:53.793 --> 38:56.195
Zilch. Just a nasty case
of mega-chafing.

38:56.228 --> 38:57.997
So sore right now.

38:59.899 --> 39:01.699
Where is she?

39:07.039 --> 39:08.640
Where did she go?

39:08.673 --> 39:11.877
Well, that's the mystery
of the hour, kid.

39:15.748 --> 39:19.218
I didn't make her up, I didn't.

39:21.320 --> 39:25.324
I know you didn't. What do they think?
You wrote the note yourself?

39:25.357 --> 39:27.326
The note!

39:27.359 --> 39:28.961
God,
I've got to give this shit up.

39:28.994 --> 39:31.964
Have a great second day. Yeah.

39:31.997 --> 39:34.300
- Love Lucy, kiss cuddle kiss.
- Yes.

39:35.801 --> 39:41.373
Oh, yeah. Ripper girl. I like her.
She's smart, she's funny.

39:41.407 --> 39:44.709
Hey. You might want
to check the case.

39:44.743 --> 39:50.349
Case. Case.
Yeah, very impressive.

39:53.718 --> 39:55.154
Yes, yes!

39:59.358 --> 40:03.129
Eh, keep looking.
Keep looking. Flip it. Flip it.

40:03.162 --> 40:05.097
Flip.

40:05.131 --> 40:06.132
Oh.

40:11.403 --> 40:12.838
"Meet me in Sydney."

40:15.141 --> 40:16.708
So, what are you waiting for,
kid?

40:25.417 --> 40:27.219
Devon.

40:28.988 --> 40:31.023
Okay. Up and at 'em.

40:42.334 --> 40:45.703
Okay, I mean, I...
I can sell you the bus ticket,

40:45.738 --> 40:50.409
but, seriously, dude, fly.
It's like a zillion k's.

40:50.442 --> 40:55.147
Yeah, well, I... I can't fly.
So, the bus ticket?

40:55.181 --> 40:57.049
Okay.

40:57.082 --> 41:02.087
- Thanks.
- Single journey, and you're not a student?

41:02.121 --> 41:05.057
Nope, just of life, thank you.

41:08.127 --> 41:11.430
This is, um,
saying it's declined.

41:11.463 --> 41:12.798
Really?

41:15.134 --> 41:17.002
Ah, my pills!

41:17.036 --> 41:19.104
Just my emergency supply.

41:27.079 --> 41:28.280
Thanks.

41:39.058 --> 41:43.262
Okay. I'm in Perth.
Lucy's in Sydney.

41:44.964 --> 41:46.298
Perth...

41:47.533 --> 41:49.401
Adelaide...

41:51.003 --> 41:52.404
Then to Sydney.

41:58.310 --> 42:00.346
Headed to Sydney.
To meet a girl.

42:00.379 --> 42:04.216
- Ah. You've got a long way to go.
- Yep. And I'm walking, so...

42:33.245 --> 42:36.081
It's upside down.
It's upside down.

42:36.115 --> 42:39.118
Please, just really, really
soft, like you're tickling it.

42:43.889 --> 42:46.325
Okay, that's enough,
that's just abuse.

42:49.962 --> 42:51.430
One-twenty.

42:53.032 --> 42:55.034
Are you kidding?
I paid like $800 for this.

42:55.067 --> 42:57.136
Yeah, it's called depreciation.

42:57.169 --> 43:02.308
And, uh, you know, with this case,
it just went down to a hundred.

43:02.341 --> 43:04.143
- A hundred bucks?
- You want to keep negotiating?

43:04.176 --> 43:09.014
Okay, fine.
Okay, a hundred lousy dollars.

43:14.353 --> 43:16.088
Yeah?

43:17.489 --> 43:19.892
Angel, slow down,
what's he doing now?

43:20.626 --> 43:24.596
Well, tell him, there's no fucking video games
until he's finished his fucking homework.

43:25.531 --> 43:26.965
Seriously?
Do you really have to use that...

43:26.999 --> 43:29.234
Look, take the cupcake off him!

43:29.268 --> 43:31.637
For Christ... You're meant
to be the boss, Angel.

43:31.670 --> 43:35.374
I mean, he's six fucking
years old, for Christ's sakes.

43:35.407 --> 43:39.978
Hey, hey! Oi! What the hell?
Get back here, you piece of shit.

43:42.414 --> 43:45.150
- Sorry! Sorry!
- Get out of it.

43:45.184 --> 43:49.488
Oi, stop him.
Get back here, you bugger.

44:08.107 --> 44:12.611
No, no, no. Shit.

44:12.644 --> 44:15.914
Oh, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

44:23.255 --> 44:25.057
Not a seasoned crim,
I'm guessing,

44:25.090 --> 44:27.159
based on leaving his actual name
behind at the crime scene.

44:27.192 --> 44:29.161
This is his medication,
he needs that...

44:32.564 --> 44:33.632
It's for schizophrenia.

44:33.665 --> 44:36.301
Oh, yikes.

44:36.335 --> 44:40.005
I'm sorry. Is he
dangerous? You think he might hurt someone?

44:40.038 --> 44:43.041
- No, no!
- If anything, he'll hurt himself.

44:43.075 --> 44:45.411
All right, well, we're doing
everything we can.

44:45.444 --> 44:47.546
He's registered
with Missing Persons,

44:47.579 --> 44:51.150
his details are on the Federal Police
website and he's flagged in our system.

44:51.183 --> 44:53.252
So he'll be able
to buy food at least.

44:53.285 --> 44:56.422
- And he hates flying, so he probably won't leave town.
- Right.

45:01.126 --> 45:03.362
It's her.
He... he's trying to find her.

45:04.463 --> 45:07.533
- Who?
- Marilyn Monroe.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.428
Meet me in Sydney.

46:16.836 --> 46:19.638
Oh, no! Blocked us.

46:36.688 --> 46:39.191
Oh, shit. Shit! Shit. Shit.

46:39.224 --> 46:41.460
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

46:41.493 --> 46:47.132
<i>You scared,
worthless little ant. Run. Run.</i>

46:50.235 --> 46:53.539
<i>No matter where you run,
you'll never get rid of me.</i>

46:53.572 --> 46:55.207
<i>I'll always be here.</i>

46:55.240 --> 46:56.675
<i>Because you're too sick.</i>

46:56.708 --> 47:00.546
<i>Rotten, broken.
I'll always be here.</i>

47:15.394 --> 47:20.465
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, there.

47:24.904 --> 47:27.406
Oh, sorry,
I was just seeing if...

47:27.439 --> 47:29.876
I'm Devon, what's your name?

47:29.909 --> 47:34.146
- Emma.
- Emma. That is a beautiful name.

47:34.179 --> 47:36.049
And is your mommy
or daddy with you?

47:37.549 --> 47:40.319
Right, well, that's a mystery
we need to solve, huh?

47:40.352 --> 47:42.621
Because I bet they're really,
really missing you.

47:45.557 --> 47:47.259
Do you want to take a walk
with me, Emma?

47:48.728 --> 47:52.531
Right.
Okay, yeah, let's try this.

47:52.564 --> 47:54.633
There we go.

47:56.201 --> 48:00.572
- Okay. And what's your friend's name?
- Rose.

48:00.606 --> 48:02.274
Rose. Okay.

48:03.308 --> 48:07.914
Which way do you reckon?
That way? Yeah.

48:07.947 --> 48:10.716
Hi, everyone.
Um, any parents among us?

48:12.184 --> 48:13.585
Anyone missing their offspring,
at all?

48:13.619 --> 48:15.520
- Ma'am, does this belong to you?
- No.

48:15.554 --> 48:17.824
No. Sir? Wake up.
Is this a match?

48:17.857 --> 48:19.324
No, it isn't. Okay.

48:19.358 --> 48:21.426
It's okay,
we're just warming up.

48:27.767 --> 48:30.770
Emma's mum? Emma's dad? Hello?

48:31.771 --> 48:33.773
How does someone just disappear?

48:34.907 --> 48:36.675
It's okay. This is fun.
Isn't this fun?

48:38.911 --> 48:40.345
Do you want to press the button?

48:40.379 --> 48:43.215
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good girl.

48:44.483 --> 48:46.819
Sorry.

48:46.853 --> 48:50.188
You know, the cool thing about having a
dragon called Rose is that instead of fire,

48:50.222 --> 48:52.591
it probably breathes flowers...

48:52.624 --> 48:54.226
- Hello?
- Hey, mate.

48:54.259 --> 48:56.729
Hi. I'm looking for a worker,
or anyone...

48:56.763 --> 49:01.199
Oh, honey! Honey! Honey!
What are you doing?

49:02.334 --> 49:04.603
Oh, thank God.

49:04.636 --> 49:07.907
No, I, we... were trying to
find you, for like an eternity.

49:07.940 --> 49:14.981
Oh, I'm... I'm useless,
I'm sorry, baby.

49:15.014 --> 49:20.352
Mummy fell asleep and...
You okay? I'm sorry.

49:20.385 --> 49:23.588
- You okay?
- It's okay. It's all good.

49:23.622 --> 49:24.957
And I'm Devon, by the way.

49:26.291 --> 49:28.226
- Matilda.
- No way.

49:28.260 --> 49:29.729
Like Waltzing Matilda?

49:30.730 --> 49:33.966
Well, that's cool.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.401
Well, thank you.

49:36.435 --> 49:41.339
Hey. You never run off on me
like that, you hear me?

49:41.373 --> 49:47.546
What did momma tell you?
Don't do that again. You scared me. Okay?

49:47.579 --> 49:53.418
Jeez, you scared me.
I'm sorry, baby. I fell asleep.

49:53.452 --> 49:56.823
- You okay?
- Oh, that's awesome, a Uniphant.

49:56.856 --> 49:58.825
Half elephant and half unicorn.

49:58.858 --> 50:02.028
No, it's a giant bear,
with wings and a stinger like a wasp's.

50:02.061 --> 50:03.796
That's so cool.

50:03.830 --> 50:05.998
And I bet that would do some
serious damage, huh?

50:08.968 --> 50:09.969
Yeah.

50:17.409 --> 50:18.710
So where are you guys headed?

50:22.048 --> 50:23.816
Somewhere new.

50:23.850 --> 50:27.820
Oh, yeah. Cool. Fresh start.

50:27.854 --> 50:30.388
Yeah. Something like that.

50:31.556 --> 50:33.391
Me? I'm not nearly as brave.

50:33.425 --> 50:35.061
That's why I've got to find her.

50:35.094 --> 50:37.429
- Who?
- Who?

50:37.462 --> 50:38.463
I'll show you.

50:43.936 --> 50:48.373
- Wow! That's really incredible.
- Thanks.

50:48.406 --> 50:52.410
Haven't really got her eyes,
or her intelligence, or her humor.

50:53.445 --> 50:54.947
But she really saved me.

50:55.882 --> 50:58.517
Picked me up
and rescued me... in a bath.

50:59.484 --> 51:01.620
But you, you... you've got this.

51:01.653 --> 51:03.455
And the bear-wasp, hell,
that's strength right there,

51:03.488 --> 51:06.025
and... and she clearly gets that
from you.

51:06.058 --> 51:08.460
So I think you're going to be
more than fine.

51:10.029 --> 51:13.966
Thanks, and I hope you find her.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.769
Gotta do whatever it takes,
right?

51:24.709 --> 51:25.845
I've got to go.

51:30.917 --> 51:32.651
Hi, just for one?

51:32.684 --> 51:35.021
Hi, no, I'm...
Do you ever dress up?

51:36.688 --> 51:40.659
- Excuse me?
- Like as in, um, 1950s style?

51:40.692 --> 51:43.395
Like characters. You know,
like for work, I mean? Here.

51:43.428 --> 51:47.033
No. No, this is bad enough
I think.

51:48.100 --> 51:53.973
Right. I'm sorry,
but I'm just wondering if...

51:54.006 --> 51:58.543
you wouldn't have ever seen
my brother, Devon, come in here

51:58.577 --> 52:01.379
and ask for a Marilyn,
or a Lucy?

52:02.114 --> 52:04.583
No, but he's super cute.

52:06.052 --> 52:07.719
- Okay, thanks.
- And Lucy's not working tonight.

52:09.421 --> 52:11.489
Lucy? There's a Lu...
there's a Lucy that works here?

52:11.523 --> 52:13.926
Yeah, but not tonight.

52:13.960 --> 52:17.429
She takes care of her grandkids
on weeknights.

52:17.462 --> 52:21.499
Okay. Thank you... I'm sorry.

53:06.245 --> 53:10.615
Oh, shit, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. My wallet.

53:11.984 --> 53:16.155
Oh, come on, man.

53:19.624 --> 53:21.928
Yeah! Yeah, just a sec!

53:32.671 --> 53:34.774
No, no. No. No. Get back!

53:34.807 --> 53:36.608
You're sick and you need to die.

53:37.843 --> 53:42.580
Mate, what the hell?
You alright? What's going on?

53:42.614 --> 53:44.216
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Are you crazy?

53:47.853 --> 53:49.587
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry, sorry!

53:49.621 --> 53:52.624
You sniveling, pathetic leech.
You're pathetic.

53:52.657 --> 53:55.995
- Mr. Rocket!
- Kid? This way! Hurry!

53:56.028 --> 53:58.530
- Twisted...
- Stop the train.

54:00.266 --> 54:01.934
You got to get out of here,
kid...

54:01.968 --> 54:04.502
Next carriage.

54:04.536 --> 54:09.041
You'll never escape me.
You abomination. You bastard of nature

54:09.075 --> 54:11.744
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

54:11.777 --> 54:13.478
Come on, kid, come on.
Come on here.

54:15.613 --> 54:18.084
That's it, D-Man,
you can do it. You gotta fly!

54:20.186 --> 54:23.289
It's time to die,
you disgusting freak!

54:23.322 --> 54:24.790
Do it.

54:29.028 --> 54:31.831
Run! Run!

54:33.099 --> 54:36.135
<i>Needles... Needles... Needles.</i>

54:36.168 --> 54:38.871
Needles... Needles... Needles.

55:00.326 --> 55:04.830
- <i>Nice work, kid. You're safe.</i>
- Okay.

55:32.124 --> 55:33.125
Yeah, they're great.

55:35.928 --> 55:37.997
Yeah, if he's wearing
sunglasses.

55:39.631 --> 55:45.738
Oh, I should've used one
with his eyes.

55:45.771 --> 55:47.907
Um, I just wanted a happy photo.

55:47.940 --> 55:50.976
They're fine, Mom. They... they're
really fine. They're great, you know.

55:51.010 --> 55:55.347
And I'm... I'm getting a couple of
messages on my website that I made,

55:55.381 --> 55:58.217
although, you know, not many are
helpful right now, but that's...

55:58.250 --> 56:01.954
It's just that I feel that he's
punishing us and you, especially.

56:02.922 --> 56:07.359
Because clearly, he is just not
capable of living on his own.

56:07.393 --> 56:12.231
God, he is! Or could be, if we just
stopped cocooning him all the time.

56:12.264 --> 56:13.933
He might as well
be in the clinic.

56:13.966 --> 56:15.633
Yeah, but he's sick, Liv.
You saw what he did.

56:15.667 --> 56:17.369
- Yes, I did, Nick. But my point...
- What?

56:17.403 --> 56:20.773
What is your point exactly?

56:27.246 --> 56:28.981
Oh.

56:35.287 --> 56:36.989
Can we not?

56:37.022 --> 56:39.225
No, no. Do you not get
how critical this time is?

56:39.258 --> 56:43.395
You're seriously asking me that?
Yes, yes, Nick, I get it.

56:43.429 --> 56:45.663
- This is all I get!
- Then I need your help.

56:47.133 --> 56:49.835
Not your passive aggression
right now.

56:49.869 --> 56:51.070
We're having a girl.

56:53.739 --> 56:55.174
She's a girl.

56:56.442 --> 56:59.378
They told me yesterday,
at the scan.

56:59.411 --> 57:00.678
Yesterday?

57:00.712 --> 57:02.214
What do you mean yesterday?

57:02.248 --> 57:03.883
You didn't tell me about it.
I don't understand it...

57:03.916 --> 57:05.784
Of course, I told you
about the scan, Nick.

57:05.818 --> 57:07.719
I just didn't remind you about
it a million times like usual

57:07.753 --> 57:09.021
because I thought you were
under too much pressure...

57:09.054 --> 57:10.289
Jesus, I'd still have
been there!

57:11.891 --> 57:12.791
I...

57:15.494 --> 57:18.063
Well, like... That is so unfair!

57:19.165 --> 57:21.267
Oh, God!

57:23.736 --> 57:27.173
Well, this is a dream moment.

59:09.475 --> 59:12.778
Hello? Anyone here?

59:56.388 --> 59:57.589
Hey.

1:00:04.596 --> 1:00:05.597
Hey.

1:00:10.235 --> 1:00:15.908
I messed up, I... I couldn't
do it, I couldn't find you.

1:00:17.076 --> 1:00:18.277
I'm sorry.

1:00:19.278 --> 1:00:21.013
But you're already
halfway there.

1:00:22.147 --> 1:00:26.885
And what you just did,
rescuing that kid, that was amazing.

1:00:27.619 --> 1:00:30.122
Yeah, but I think
she stole my wallet.

1:00:32.524 --> 1:00:36.061
And I lost my guitar.

1:00:38.030 --> 1:00:39.131
It's just a guitar.

1:00:40.399 --> 1:00:43.068
No, no, it was my luck.

1:00:45.471 --> 1:00:47.106
Well, then, find some more.

1:01:00.119 --> 1:01:01.453
I'll see you soon.

1:01:27.246 --> 1:01:28.580
Ow, shoot.

1:01:41.193 --> 1:01:43.629
Yes. Yes.

1:01:44.696 --> 1:01:48.333
This is all I need, yes.
My luck.

1:01:56.575 --> 1:01:59.978
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey. Over here!

1:02:00.012 --> 1:02:01.580
Hey, stop.

1:02:22.234 --> 1:02:24.970
Yes! Yes, yes! Hey.

1:02:26.071 --> 1:02:29.575
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1:02:29.608 --> 1:02:36.114
Hi. Thank you. I, um...
I... I got a little waylaid.

1:02:36.148 --> 1:02:37.516
No shit.

1:02:39.318 --> 1:02:41.553
I'm heading to Warramboo, a couple of hours
away, towards Port Augusta if you want a lift.

1:02:41.587 --> 1:02:45.657
Port Augusta. Holy crap.
Yes, that'd be beyond amazing...

1:02:45.691 --> 1:02:46.658
Oh, uh...

1:02:47.626 --> 1:02:49.361
Don't worry.
I only shoot things that bounce.

1:02:51.463 --> 1:02:52.732
Oh, right.

1:02:53.766 --> 1:02:54.767
Yeah.

1:02:57.336 --> 1:02:58.237
Oh...

1:02:59.471 --> 1:03:03.375
Oh, man, oh, that's...
Yes, please.

1:03:03.408 --> 1:03:05.377
- I'm Devon.
- Tommy.

1:03:19.826 --> 1:03:21.693
- Shit!
- What was that?

1:03:21.728 --> 1:03:23.495
Second time this month.

1:03:33.773 --> 1:03:37.409
- You've never done this before?
- Ah, nope.

1:03:38.710 --> 1:03:40.479
With LEGO, yeah.

1:03:44.583 --> 1:03:45.717
Well, you've got to make sure
the jack's underneath the frame,

1:03:47.653 --> 1:03:50.489
and then you loosen the nuts
while it's on the ground.

1:04:10.275 --> 1:04:12.477
All the best, eh.

1:04:12.511 --> 1:04:18.617
Tommy, thank you so much,
a million times over, and you go get her!

1:04:34.901 --> 1:04:37.502
You're a beautiful sleeper.

1:04:48.413 --> 1:04:49.916
- Good morning.
- Would you like one?

1:04:49.949 --> 1:04:51.450
- Yes, please.
- With some sauce?

1:04:51.483 --> 1:04:54.219
Thanks. Perfect. Thank you. Bye.

1:05:05.932 --> 1:05:08.567
Hi, are you going
through Adelaide?

1:05:21.613 --> 1:05:22.849
Thank you very much.

1:06:07.659 --> 1:06:09.361
Where the hell are you?

1:06:19.872 --> 1:06:23.208
Come on, keep going.
Mum is expecting us, so...

1:06:26.813 --> 1:06:27.780
Good day.

1:06:39.591 --> 1:06:40.760
Dammit.

1:06:43.695 --> 1:06:46.631
Hey. Hi, there.

1:06:46.665 --> 1:06:51.003
- You need a hand?
- Ah, it's, it's fine, thanks. I've called for help already.

1:06:51.037 --> 1:06:53.505
Just these nuts
are completely stuck.

1:06:53.538 --> 1:06:57.810
Oh, well, first, the tire's got to be on
the ground, and then you loosen the nuts...

1:06:57.844 --> 1:06:58.710
Oh.

1:07:00.046 --> 1:07:02.681
- Let me help you.
- Thanks, mate.

1:07:08.653 --> 1:07:11.356
And this is a song I wrote
for a girl called Lucy.

1:07:11.389 --> 1:07:14.693

1:08:19.591 --> 1:08:20.726
Yay!

1:08:23.095 --> 1:08:25.064
You have to let us know
when you find her.

1:08:25.097 --> 1:08:27.066
Yes. I'll try
and do that. And good luck!

1:08:27.099 --> 1:08:28.734
- You too, Devon.
- Bye, Devon!

1:08:28.768 --> 1:08:29.869
Bye.

1:08:32.805 --> 1:08:34.506
Bye.

1:09:09.108 --> 1:09:10.142
Lucy?

1:09:16.749 --> 1:09:17.716
Lucy?

1:09:23.022 --> 1:09:24.156
Hey, hey. Lucy.

1:09:24.190 --> 1:09:28.828
Hey. Oh, sorry, sorry.

1:09:33.766 --> 1:09:39.772
<i>Embrace your destiny.
Embrace your destiny.</i>

1:09:41.207 --> 1:09:43.009
<i>Embrace your destiny.</i>

1:09:46.511 --> 1:09:50.082
<i>But Sydney, my God,
if I was anywhere else.</i>

1:09:50.116 --> 1:09:52.752
<i>It's pulsing.</i>

1:09:52.785 --> 1:09:56.856
<i>Even from the tranquility of Hyde Park,
you can still feel the city humming,</i>

1:09:56.889 --> 1:09:59.658
<i>seducing you
with its magical past.</i>

1:10:00.726 --> 1:10:02.560
<i>Embrace your destiny.</i>

1:10:02.594 --> 1:10:03.963
Hyde Park.

1:10:03.996 --> 1:10:06.966
Excuse me.
Sorry, which way to Hyde Park?

1:10:06.999 --> 1:10:08.234
- Straight ahead.
- Thanks.

1:10:08.267 --> 1:10:10.702
Excuse me, sir, excuse me.
Sorry.

1:11:24.276 --> 1:11:25.710
Hey.

1:11:33.618 --> 1:11:35.888
- Whoa...
- It's fine, I've got it.

1:11:35.921 --> 1:11:38.324
Yeah, but I said that I'd do it.

1:11:38.357 --> 1:11:41.659
You shouldn't be trying to do anything
physical right now, Liv, you know that.

1:11:46.966 --> 1:11:52.104
- Fine. You do it.
- Thanks, I will.

1:11:56.275 --> 1:11:57.276
Oh...

1:11:57.309 --> 1:11:59.845
Oh, Jesus. Liv! Liv?

1:12:05.217 --> 1:12:06.819
<i>Oh, look at you.</i>

1:12:06.852 --> 1:12:09.789
<i>Look at you,
cowering, pathetic...</i>

1:12:09.822 --> 1:12:12.224
<i>You'll never find her,
she's not here.</i>

1:12:12.258 --> 1:12:17.695
<i>You're never going to find her,
because she never wanted to see you again.</i>

1:12:17.730 --> 1:12:19.165
<i>She's scared of you.</i>

1:12:19.198 --> 1:12:20.833
Sir? Young man?

1:12:22.134 --> 1:12:23.769
Is it you?

1:12:25.237 --> 1:12:27.239
Heavens, so it is.

1:12:28.673 --> 1:12:31.343
Though I thought you'd have
a sword, and maybe some wings?

1:12:31.377 --> 1:12:33.112
Oh, no, no, I think
you've got the wrong guy.

1:12:33.145 --> 1:12:34.646
But you have the shield.

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:39.752
You're my angel, aren't you?

1:12:39.785 --> 1:12:42.188
I'm just trying to find someone.

1:12:47.993 --> 1:12:49.195
You've lost your shoes?

1:12:51.663 --> 1:12:54.266
Yes, it seems I did.

1:13:13.252 --> 1:13:15.121
These are roughly the same size.

1:13:22.828 --> 1:13:24.897
Well, then,
you are an angel after all.

1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:31.003
You've hit the jackpot,
minestrone!

1:13:31.904 --> 1:13:35.441
And... ta-da!

1:13:35.474 --> 1:13:38.043
They were just giving
these beauties away.

1:13:38.077 --> 1:13:40.946
And they make quite
the statement, don't you think?

1:13:40.980 --> 1:13:42.314
Yeah.

1:13:43.349 --> 1:13:44.350
Thank you. That's...

1:13:48.420 --> 1:13:52.324
Sorry, it's not personal.

1:13:52.358 --> 1:13:55.794
Sure, it's okay. I get it.

1:14:07.439 --> 1:14:12.011
The name's Soul,
as in "heart and soul".

1:14:12.044 --> 1:14:17.682
Yeah, right.
Devon, as in... Devon.

1:14:28.194 --> 1:14:30.930
Uriel, that's who's coming
for me,

1:14:30.963 --> 1:14:33.265
the angel of wisdom,
with the light of God.

1:14:35.467 --> 1:14:38.304
Awesome, she sounds cool.

1:14:39.538 --> 1:14:41.840
And who is it
you're looking for?

1:14:41.874 --> 1:14:45.244
A noblewoman? Dashing young man?

1:14:45.277 --> 1:14:48.113
Hm. A girl, woman.

1:14:49.548 --> 1:14:52.051
Lucy.

1:14:52.084 --> 1:14:54.053
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."

1:14:56.188 --> 1:14:58.390
Yes, exactly!

1:14:58.424 --> 1:15:05.197
And this...
this is a picture of her.

1:15:05.231 --> 1:15:07.466
In crayon form.

1:15:08.901 --> 1:15:10.402
Be still my heart.

1:15:11.437 --> 1:15:13.772
Yeah, and she saved my life.

1:15:13.806 --> 1:15:16.141
And... and she's somewhere
in Sydney, that's all I know.

1:15:17.109 --> 1:15:18.244
Then you know what we must do?

1:15:21.547 --> 1:15:25.017
And I have a comrade in the
State Library who can help us.

1:15:54.113 --> 1:15:56.115
Lucy!

1:15:56.148 --> 1:15:59.985
- Lucy!
- Lucy? Wherefore art thou, Lucy.

1:16:00.019 --> 1:16:03.889
See? The whispers are spreading,
your courageous prince awaits!

1:16:03.922 --> 1:16:06.191
Who are they? Tim and Milly?

1:16:07.459 --> 1:16:08.527
Oh, sorry.

1:16:10.963 --> 1:16:15.901
They're an illusion.
Make believe. From another life.

1:16:15.934 --> 1:16:18.437
But clearly,
they meant something to you.

1:16:18.470 --> 1:16:23.942
Listen to me, to survive this world,
you have to let go of everything.

1:16:26.578 --> 1:16:29.114
Surrender to the chaos!
It's the only way.

1:16:29.148 --> 1:16:32.951
And then... then we can find
our Uriel, and Lucy.

1:16:32.985 --> 1:16:36.422
But... but Lucy...
Lucy isn't make believe.

1:16:36.455 --> 1:16:39.892
- Hi, sorry, Lucy?
- Hi.

1:16:39.925 --> 1:16:42.928
- Are you Devon?
- Yeah.

1:16:42.961 --> 1:16:47.499
I'm Amiya. I'm a producer on
"Mornings", the breakfast show?

1:16:49.335 --> 1:16:51.637
I saw your posters of Lucy.

1:16:51.670 --> 1:16:55.507
And if you don't mind me asking,
how did you lose her?

1:16:58.444 --> 1:17:00.412
- Hey.
- Thanks.

1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:02.381
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1:17:02.414 --> 1:17:04.483
How are you feeling?

1:17:04.516 --> 1:17:08.987
Uh, better, though I'm almost done
with this bag. Can't get enough.

1:17:18.597 --> 1:17:23.535
It's just the stress of everything
and then the timing of all of it.

1:17:23.569 --> 1:17:24.937
I'm sorry.

1:17:27.406 --> 1:17:29.975
I just always felt like I was
attached to him, you know.

1:17:31.176 --> 1:17:36.014
And I... and I knew how he was
feeling, and I knew where he was.

1:17:37.216 --> 1:17:41.086
God, Nick. Aren't you exhausted?

1:17:43.188 --> 1:17:46.091
<i>She's like pure sunlight
when she smiles and laughs,</i>

1:17:46.125 --> 1:17:48.026
<i>but also really strong,
you know.</i>

1:17:48.060 --> 1:17:49.661
<i>Like she's been through a lot
herself.</i>

1:17:49.695 --> 1:17:53.265
<i>And she adores Sydney,
from the harbor to Hyde Park...</i>

1:17:53.298 --> 1:17:55.067
<i>Hyde Park, that's where
I'm going to wait for her.</i>

1:17:55.100 --> 1:17:57.302
<i>No matter how long it takes,
I'll do it.</i>

1:17:57.336 --> 1:18:00.472
<i>Just so I can hold her again,
and tell her everything's okay.</i>

1:18:00.506 --> 1:18:05.944
<i>Oh, that's really beautiful. To travel
across the entire country like this.</i>

1:18:05.978 --> 1:18:07.479
<i>What an incredible thing...</i>

1:18:08.414 --> 1:18:11.016
- Oh, shit. No, no, no, no.
- Hey, excuse me!

1:18:11.049 --> 1:18:13.218
- Just wait a...
- Oh, thank God, Nick.

1:18:13.252 --> 1:18:14.653
He's on.

1:18:14.686 --> 1:18:16.355
<i>She woke me up,
and she healed me.</i>

1:18:16.388 --> 1:18:19.425
<i>And I can feel it.
I know I'm close.</i>

1:18:19.458 --> 1:18:21.193
<i>She's been guiding me
this whole time.</i>

1:18:21.226 --> 1:18:23.328
<i>Like she's pulling me in
towards her, you know.</i>

1:18:23.362 --> 1:18:26.298
Like giving me strength
and energy to keep searching.

1:18:26.331 --> 1:18:28.133
And... and now I've got Soul
with me.

1:18:28.167 --> 1:18:30.469
Not like soul, soul, but as in,
you know, heart and soul.

1:18:30.502 --> 1:18:34.973
She... She wrote me a note, "Meet me
in Sydney" and I can feel her. I can.

1:18:35.007 --> 1:18:37.342
I need her more than air.

1:18:37.376 --> 1:18:39.978
So adorable.

1:18:40.012 --> 1:18:44.016
Well, look, your posters here, "Have you
seen Lucy?" are plastered all over the city.

1:18:44.049 --> 1:18:46.218
Look at that,
you're quite the artist.

1:18:46.251 --> 1:18:49.621
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh! If I went missing and a guy did something like this for me,

1:18:49.655 --> 1:18:51.590
oh, I'd just melt.

1:18:54.359 --> 1:18:58.997
<i>You fool. Don't you realize
this is a trap. They're all in on it.</i>

1:18:59.031 --> 1:19:02.701
<i>Look at yourself. You pathetic...
Pathetic. You're pathetic.</i>

1:19:02.735 --> 1:19:05.504
But it must be really worrying
that you don't know where she is.

1:19:05.537 --> 1:19:07.539
- Um...
- <i>They've taken her.</i>

1:19:07.573 --> 1:19:09.575
- <i>She's not here.</i>
- Yeah, she's pretty much all I think about.

1:19:09.608 --> 1:19:10.642
<i>But I am.</i>

1:19:14.613 --> 1:19:17.583
<i>Now there's no way out...</i>

1:19:17.616 --> 1:19:21.119
<i>I'm getting stronger
and stronger. Stronger.</i>

1:19:21.153 --> 1:19:23.489
<i>See how sick you are. Sick.</i>

1:19:23.522 --> 1:19:26.091
So, mate, if Lucy is watching...

1:19:28.126 --> 1:19:29.428
Uh, um...

1:19:29.461 --> 1:19:31.597
- Sorry, I can't...
- What's going on?

1:19:31.630 --> 1:19:35.334
Well, we wish you all the best,
and you'll have to let us know.

1:19:35.367 --> 1:19:38.270
Stop! Stop!
Soul... Please, I need this.

1:19:38.303 --> 1:19:40.138
- I've got it.
- No, yeah, but it's my luck. It's my luck.

1:19:40.172 --> 1:19:41.473
- Son.
- Mr. Rocket!

1:19:41.507 --> 1:19:43.542
<i>Mr. Rocket's not here.
He left you too.</i>

1:19:43.575 --> 1:19:45.210
Mr. Rocket!

1:19:45.244 --> 1:19:47.513
That's what love will do
to you, folks.

1:19:47.546 --> 1:19:50.182
- Stand back.
- <i>You've got no one but me now. No one.</i>

1:19:50.215 --> 1:19:51.250
Devon, wait!

1:19:54.353 --> 1:19:55.587
No! No, don't...

1:20:04.864 --> 1:20:06.799
No!

1:20:06.833 --> 1:20:09.668
<i>You can't escape me.</i>

1:20:12.739 --> 1:20:14.439
- Oh, sorry.
- Idiot!

1:20:34.192 --> 1:20:36.228
- Son?
- No. No! Get away from me.

1:20:36.261 --> 1:20:37.629
It's okay. It's me.

1:20:37.663 --> 1:20:38.697
What... what do you want
from me?

1:20:38.731 --> 1:20:42.334
Only... your soul.

1:20:43.368 --> 1:20:45.170
- Fuck you!
- No contact.

1:20:45.203 --> 1:20:47.506
- Get away from me.
- I can't be touched.

1:20:57.482 --> 1:20:58.383
Oh.

1:21:32.384 --> 1:21:33.619
Dev?

1:21:37.556 --> 1:21:39.391
Devon!

1:21:39.424 --> 1:21:40.559
Devon?

1:21:41.728 --> 1:21:43.228
Devon! Devon!

1:21:45.230 --> 1:21:46.766
No, no, no. Dev. Dev. Dev.

1:21:48.835 --> 1:21:51.570
Dev! Dev! Mate, mate, mate.

1:21:53.740 --> 1:21:55.340
It's me, it's Nicky.

1:21:57.676 --> 1:22:00.412
Hey, mate. Hey, mate.

1:22:00.445 --> 1:22:02.882
Hey, mate, I'm here. Hey, mate.

1:22:13.826 --> 1:22:15.193
You okay?

1:22:18.597 --> 1:22:20.165
No, no, don't talk, don't talk.
Look.

1:22:22.367 --> 1:22:23.669
Mate, it's good to see you.

1:22:51.630 --> 1:22:53.265
So good to see you, Nicky.

1:22:57.502 --> 1:22:58.838
So good to see you.

1:23:07.345 --> 1:23:08.580
I love you, brother.

1:23:14.787 --> 1:23:16.354
Get some sleep, mate.

1:23:22.327 --> 1:23:23.528
Mm...

1:23:27.033 --> 1:23:28.901
Bacon is a gift,
don't you think?

1:23:28.935 --> 1:23:31.037
I mean, I hate thinking about
the whole pig thing because,

1:23:31.070 --> 1:23:33.940
you know, they're actually the
smartest domesticated animal there is,

1:23:33.973 --> 1:23:37.342
and beautiful, and very clean, they don't
like to defecate where they sleep...

1:23:37.375 --> 1:23:40.012
I know that you hate flying but there's...
there's no other option.

1:23:40.046 --> 1:23:42.414
So, I booked our flights.

1:23:42.447 --> 1:23:46.318
We've got about half an hour
until we have to book a cab, so.

1:23:46.351 --> 1:23:49.554
Um, yeah, no,
I'm not going back.

1:23:50.655 --> 1:23:52.024
Yeah, you are.

1:23:52.058 --> 1:23:53.893
- No, I came here to find her and that's what I'm going to do.
- Devon!

1:23:55.494 --> 1:23:58.497
When are you going to stop this?
And when are you gonna get it?

1:24:02.567 --> 1:24:04.436
I don't know
what you want me to say.

1:24:06.438 --> 1:24:09.508
You're sick.
And you know that you're sick.

1:24:09.541 --> 1:24:14.881
So, why can't you see that this Lucy,
she is not real, she never was real!

1:24:17.482 --> 1:24:18.483
Really?

1:24:22.687 --> 1:24:23.823
Arsehole.

1:24:25.158 --> 1:24:28.527
Hey! I am not doing this anymore!
I am not chasing after you!

1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:29.962
Take your fucking bag.

1:24:29.996 --> 1:24:31.530
You don't understand,
no one understands.

1:24:31.563 --> 1:24:33.733
I'm about the only person
who does, mate!

1:24:33.766 --> 1:24:37.804
- Fuck it off me.
- Have you ever thought about what it's like for me, huh?

1:24:37.837 --> 1:24:39.704
You have always come first,
always.

1:24:39.739 --> 1:24:42.607
- Even from the very beginning!
- All I want is to be normal!

1:24:42.641 --> 1:24:43.776
- Like you!
- Really?

1:24:44.744 --> 1:24:47.579
You want to be like me?
Seriously? Okay.

1:24:48.915 --> 1:24:51.117
Because, this is me, right,

1:24:51.150 --> 1:24:54.653
I've just abandoned my job and I've
left my pregnant wife in a hospital

1:24:54.686 --> 1:24:58.590
so that I could fly across the country
and rescue my... my nutcase brother,

1:24:58.623 --> 1:25:01.127
once again, who didn't have
the slightest thought to call me

1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:04.429
and let me know that he was still
alive, because that's my life.

1:25:06.833 --> 1:25:08.366
That's my fucking normal!

1:25:10.803 --> 1:25:14.006
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I didn't call.
I'm... I'm sorry you came here.

1:25:16.742 --> 1:25:18.077
Is Liv okay?

1:25:22.748 --> 1:25:27.787
Can we... can we just go home?
Can we do that? Please?

1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:31.891
But she told me,
she told me to meet her, the note!

1:25:31.924 --> 1:25:34.160
Look she wrote this,
after the night, she wrote this,

1:25:34.193 --> 1:25:35.995
asking me to meet her here,
to find her!

1:25:50.977 --> 1:25:56.548
No, no, this, this isn't... just...
I must have got them confused.

1:25:57.649 --> 1:26:00.652
"Have a great second day, meet me in
Sydney," that's what the note said.

1:26:00.685 --> 1:26:01.888
It was in my pocket.

1:26:01.921 --> 1:26:04.757
- Devon.
- And it was here.

1:26:04.790 --> 1:26:06.859
I must have got them mixed up
or something, because...

1:26:06.893 --> 1:26:08.761
Mate, I'm sorry.

1:26:11.998 --> 1:26:15.001
"Have a great second day,
meet me in Sydney." No?

1:27:02.714 --> 1:27:05.818
Hey, see?
This is nice, isn't it?

1:27:17.163 --> 1:27:23.235
Right, you could put a towel up or something
on these or we could stick that down.

1:27:24.971 --> 1:27:26.038
All right.

1:27:33.913 --> 1:27:35.647
There we go.

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:39.251
- Oh, no, no, no. I don't think...
- It's okay, it's okay.

1:27:39.285 --> 1:27:42.121
- No, really, I don't need a shower.
- It's... it's... it's okay.

1:27:42.154 --> 1:27:43.089
It's okay.

1:27:52.798 --> 1:27:53.933
It's fine.

1:28:00.006 --> 1:28:02.674
It sounds like a real adventure.

1:28:04.210 --> 1:28:07.113
Got to see so many things,
meet so many people.

1:28:08.848 --> 1:28:12.550
And I don't see your admission that
Lucy isn't real as a defeat, at all.

1:28:12.584 --> 1:28:15.921
What? How is that not a defeat?

1:28:16.889 --> 1:28:22.028
Because you're becoming
more aware, more in control.

1:28:22.061 --> 1:28:24.230
And that is a really
positive thing.

1:28:27.900 --> 1:28:33.671
But I'm never gonna
leave here, am I?

1:28:37.243 --> 1:28:38.744
I can't trust anything.

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:42.748
I've just got to...

1:28:45.217 --> 1:28:47.019
Just got to surrender
to the chaos.

1:28:49.755 --> 1:28:51.891
I really don't think
you're seeing this yet.

1:28:54.727 --> 1:29:00.299
That love you felt for her, that you
described to me, that gave me chills.

1:29:00.332 --> 1:29:04.336
You felt that; that was still real for
you, even if she wasn't.

1:29:05.271 --> 1:29:09.308
And when she asked you to meet her on the
other side of the country, you made it.

1:29:10.743 --> 1:29:14.180
But that's when I thought
she was waiting,

1:29:17.850 --> 1:29:22.855
that's when I thought she...
she'd saved me.

1:29:24.824 --> 1:29:26.025
But she never did.

1:29:30.329 --> 1:29:31.297
Devon,

1:29:32.731 --> 1:29:37.803
the only person in this world who
is ever going to save you, is you.

1:30:33.759 --> 1:30:35.227
Devon?

1:30:36.729 --> 1:30:39.098
You alright? Are you hurt?

1:30:40.366 --> 1:30:45.771
I've just gotta get out of here.
I can't be in here anymore.

1:30:45.804 --> 1:30:49.909
And I'm okay.
I'm calm, really, I'm medicated.

1:30:51.010 --> 1:30:53.445
Then you don't need to escape.

1:30:53.479 --> 1:30:55.680
You were admitted voluntarily.

1:30:58.284 --> 1:30:59.852
Oh.

1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:29.815
Hi. Devon.

1:31:29.848 --> 1:31:31.383
It's fine, I was allowed out.

1:31:32.451 --> 1:31:35.087
And I was really hoping,
only if it's okay with you,

1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:37.957
to just quietly camp out
for a few days, tops.

1:31:37.990 --> 1:31:39.792
- Hey, ya.
- Hey.

1:31:39.825 --> 1:31:41.894
And I... I picked up this
organic ginger-chicken soup,

1:31:41.927 --> 1:31:43.429
which they told me is really
good for morning sickness,

1:31:43.462 --> 1:31:46.932
even though I know
you're in your last trimester.

1:31:46.966 --> 1:31:49.501
- Ahh, okay.
- Yeah.

1:31:49.535 --> 1:31:50.803
Thanks.

1:31:51.904 --> 1:31:52.805
Um...

1:31:54.173 --> 1:31:55.207
- Yeah, come in.
- Yeah, come in.

1:31:55.241 --> 1:31:56.408
Cool.

1:32:00.813 --> 1:32:01.513
Mm...

1:32:03.983 --> 1:32:05.517
Interesting.

1:32:11.123 --> 1:32:13.559
Look, dear,
this isn't a negotiation.

1:32:13.592 --> 1:32:16.228
I just don't need
any more tiny spoons.

1:32:16.262 --> 1:32:18.564
Oi, hey, no, you, get out.
Get the hell...

1:32:18.597 --> 1:32:21.166
- I... I come in peace.
- I said get out of my store.

1:32:21.200 --> 1:32:22.434
Interest. Yeah.

1:32:23.702 --> 1:32:26.138
I know my brother already paid
back what I procured from you,

1:32:26.171 --> 1:32:29.508
but I just wanted to make sure
we were all good.

1:32:35.047 --> 1:32:36.815
And so,
now that that's all behind us,

1:32:36.849 --> 1:32:41.553
I was wondering, uh,
about a job? Here?

1:32:43.155 --> 1:32:44.390
Me, working?

1:32:47.426 --> 1:32:48.527
Fuck no.

1:33:03.208 --> 1:33:07.212

1:33:08.647 --> 1:33:11.850
You haven't spent much time
in one place?

1:33:11.884 --> 1:33:13.585
Work-wise, I mean.

1:33:13.619 --> 1:33:15.154
Yeah, no, not really.

1:33:15.187 --> 1:33:17.289
Uh, I've been fairly fluid
in that regard,

1:33:17.323 --> 1:33:20.359
but I really dig your store,
and I freaking love classic rock,

1:33:20.392 --> 1:33:23.829
all musical genres really,
except for country and jazz, obviously.

1:33:25.631 --> 1:33:28.867
But, okay.

1:33:28.901 --> 1:33:30.936
See, the thing is

1:33:30.969 --> 1:33:32.371
I intermittently suffer from
schizophrenia, but honestly, it's...

1:33:33.672 --> 1:33:37.876
Sorry, but this is sweet as...

1:33:37.910 --> 1:33:42.014
And I'm on the patches! Go me!

1:33:46.452 --> 1:33:48.387
It's almost completely
under control.

1:33:51.056 --> 1:33:55.027
That's it! Lead vocals,
"They Said It Wouldn't Last."

1:33:55.060 --> 1:33:56.562
That's where I know you from.

1:33:56.595 --> 1:33:58.364
Ah, yeah.

1:33:58.397 --> 1:34:02.101
Deadly. You seriously rocked.

1:34:03.302 --> 1:34:08.574
Where've you guys been?
I'm a keys player myself, my first love.

1:34:08.607 --> 1:34:10.342
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:35.401
In the bedroom.

1:34:49.982 --> 1:34:50.682
- Hey!
- Hey!

1:34:52.384 --> 1:34:54.720
Yeah, we can order that in
for you, you bet.

1:34:54.754 --> 1:34:58.257
Bowie, on vinyl, that's a winning bar
mitzvah present right there, hands down.

1:35:02.995 --> 1:35:05.230
Um, could you hold, for a sec?

1:35:14.006 --> 1:35:15.207
Hey.

1:35:34.193 --> 1:35:35.093
Devon?

1:35:41.433 --> 1:35:46.538
My God, I... I looked for you.

1:35:49.107 --> 1:35:51.243
I... I don't...
I don't understand.

1:36:05.123 --> 1:36:11.096
For years, I was obsessed,
and you didn't even have a phone,

1:36:11.129 --> 1:36:12.998
who doesn't have a phone?

1:36:15.300 --> 1:36:16.468
And you were right here?

1:36:18.103 --> 1:36:20.472
Years? What do you...
what do you... what do you mean?

1:36:23.175 --> 1:36:28.046
I went to the hospital, they... they refused
to help me find you after you, uh...

1:36:29.448 --> 1:36:32.618
disappeared, or got moved
to a new clinic, I guess.

1:36:33.820 --> 1:36:36.522
And "nothing about our pasts,"
remember?

1:36:36.555 --> 1:36:40.125
That was your rule, every...
everything in the moment.

1:36:43.863 --> 1:36:45.430
Everything in the moment.

1:37:13.292 --> 1:37:14.192
Mm?

1:37:16.695 --> 1:37:18.330
Prepare yourself.

1:37:18.363 --> 1:37:22.501
You're about to fall in love.
You ready?

1:37:28.307 --> 1:37:30.142
Cowardly Lion.

1:37:33.545 --> 1:37:34.747
Bumblebee.

1:37:38.150 --> 1:37:42.287
- Spacedog.
- Spaceman.

1:37:42.321 --> 1:37:44.824
Ah... Spaceman.

1:37:54.399 --> 1:37:56.101
Is this against the rules?

1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:02.174
Yep.

1:38:09.281 --> 1:38:10.515
And so is that.

1:38:15.387 --> 1:38:20.292
Do you want to do something with me?
Outside? Together?

1:39:12.845 --> 1:39:16.381
That's... Yeah.

1:39:16.415 --> 1:39:18.650
I was on all this
different stuff back then

1:39:18.684 --> 1:39:21.620
and one anti-psych
was clashing with another,

1:39:21.653 --> 1:39:23.655
which we only figured out
months later

1:39:26.258 --> 1:39:29.361
and I lost
a whole chunk of time.

1:39:34.033 --> 1:39:35.367
I'm sorry.

1:39:38.670 --> 1:39:42.674
It's okay. I'm sorry too.

1:39:43.976 --> 1:39:46.244
But I do remember you, us.

1:39:48.380 --> 1:39:50.315
And I've been looking
for you too.

1:39:51.784 --> 1:39:52.885
You have?

1:39:56.655 --> 1:39:58.858
You look really well.

1:40:00.559 --> 1:40:01.593
Same.

1:40:02.527 --> 1:40:07.299
And, yeah,
I had that dark patch, but...

1:40:08.467 --> 1:40:10.937
time, you know?

1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:18.610
I got my shit together,
and I've been in Sydney,

1:40:18.643 --> 1:40:20.278
actually,
the last couple of years.

1:40:20.312 --> 1:40:22.614
And I missed home so much,
I just came back.

1:40:25.717 --> 1:40:27.586
And how are you doing?

1:40:28.687 --> 1:40:31.991
Good. I'm doing really good.

1:40:33.625 --> 1:40:34.861
Good.

1:40:38.931 --> 1:40:40.833
What are your plans tonight?

1:40:57.616 --> 1:40:59.018
Oh...

1:40:59.051 --> 1:41:00.052
Devon!

1:41:03.488 --> 1:41:05.323
Hey.

1:41:05.357 --> 1:41:10.897
- Oh, this is so great, thanks, guys.
- Hey, Dev. Hey.

1:41:10.930 --> 1:41:12.564
How... how are you...
how are you doing?

1:41:12.597 --> 1:41:14.533
Awesome. Are you kidding?

1:41:14.566 --> 1:41:16.701
Oh, actually, that's her seat.

1:41:16.736 --> 1:41:19.437
- But that's fine, she can...
- No, that's okay.

1:41:28.815 --> 1:41:31.083
Do you guys want to start
with a drink? Or...

1:41:31.117 --> 1:41:34.386
Ah, I'll probably
just have water.

1:41:34.419 --> 1:41:35.453
- Right.
- Yeah.

1:41:35.487 --> 1:41:36.756
Of course.

1:41:36.789 --> 1:41:39.324
Water. Okay.

1:41:43.528 --> 1:41:46.631
Hi. Nick, right?

1:41:46.665 --> 1:41:49.001
I mean, of course, you are.
Look at you.

1:41:50.435 --> 1:41:52.671
I... I've heard so much
about you.

1:41:53.773 --> 1:41:56.142
- Hi.
- Olivia?

1:41:56.175 --> 1:41:58.144
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

1:41:58.177 --> 1:42:00.679
- You too.
- Congratulations.

1:42:00.712 --> 1:42:02.748
- Thanks.
- Lucy.

1:42:02.782 --> 1:42:05.117
