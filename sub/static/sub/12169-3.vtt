00:07.127 --> 00:08.924
Are you all right, colonel ?

00:09.127 --> 00:12.005
It’s nothing, just a cold. No big deal.
Just annoying.

00:12.407 --> 00:14.045
- Talk about annoying...
- What ?

00:14.207 --> 00:16.402
We should be focusing
on harvesting space gates.

00:16.567 --> 00:20.082
That’s what we’re doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. detected life signs.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.437
We have to check it out.
That’s the protocol.

00:22.647 --> 00:26.117
Identifying space gates to complete
the intergalactic bridge...

00:26.287 --> 00:28.482
... should be our priority,
not making contact...

00:28.647 --> 00:30.558
... with the locals
of a backwater hamlet.

00:30.767 --> 00:33.645
- Are you that eager to return to Earth ?
- This isn’t about me.

00:33.847 --> 00:37.442
It’s the ability to go back and forth
between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.

00:37.607 --> 00:39.916
- And whenever l want to.
- How’s that work, again ?

00:40.087 --> 00:41.236
Okay.

00:41.407 --> 00:44.683
Once we’ve seeded enough stargates
between Pegasus and the Milky Way...

00:44.847 --> 00:48.840
... we’Il take a Jumper from one
to the other till we reach the other side.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.840
<i>We won’t tax the ZPM,
we won’t be reliant on the Daedalus.</i>

00:52.007 --> 00:54.396
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis
will be cut...

00:54.567 --> 00:56.683
... from three weeks to 30 minutes.

00:57.087 --> 00:58.566
- Very clever.
- Yes.

00:59.287 --> 01:00.879
It was Samantha Carter’s idea.

01:01.247 --> 01:03.556
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.927 --> 01:22.320
Okay, let’s just make contact,
buy our souvenirs and get out of here.

01:22.807 --> 01:24.320
Fair day to you.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.876
Fair day to you.

01:27.487 --> 01:30.604
Nothing here. We should probably go.

01:30.767 --> 01:34.203
Yeah, probably wouldn’t hurt
to make contact with the locals, though.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.881
- No, when you’re right, you’re right.
- We’re here now--

01:37.047 --> 01:41.518
Hello. Hello, new people. Why didn’t
anybody tell me they were here yet ?

01:41.687 --> 01:44.440
- Lucius, l’ve missed you.
- Willa, l was just out for a walk.

01:44.607 --> 01:47.201
- Have you met the new people yet ?
- We just got here.

01:47.367 --> 01:50.564
Oh, great. Then l haven’t missed
anything. l hate missing things.

01:50.727 --> 01:53.605
Have you met my wife Willa ?
Isn’t she gorgeous ?

01:53.927 --> 01:55.997
My other wives,
they’re just making lunch.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.520
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.

01:58.127 --> 02:00.243
l love you. l love you.
Fair day, everybody.

02:00.407 --> 02:01.681
Fair day, Lucius.

02:01.847 --> 02:05.078
l’m John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.

02:05.247 --> 02:08.000
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.

02:08.366 --> 02:10.198
Teyla.

02:10.366 --> 02:13.279
- And you are from. . ?
- Athos.

02:13.487 --> 02:16.081
Athos. Yeah, Athos.
l’ve never been there.

02:16.287 --> 02:18.084
Sounds nice. Is it nice ?

02:18.447 --> 02:20.324
Until it was culled by the Wraith.

02:20.527 --> 02:22.438
Oh, l hate them.

02:22.607 --> 02:26.316
What do you say you and me
get together, have lunch, talk about this ?

02:26.487 --> 02:27.556
Maybe have some wine ?

02:27.967 --> 02:29.844
We don’t even know your name.

02:38.087 --> 02:39.361
We’re serious.

02:40.127 --> 02:43.005
You mean you truly
have not heard of Lucius ?

02:43.367 --> 02:44.766
Well, everyone knows.

02:45.527 --> 02:48.166
He’s the wisest and kindest man
among the stars.

02:48.367 --> 02:50.039
Oh, people just say that.

02:50.207 --> 02:53.517
l mean, you can’t prove it
till you’ve met everybody, am l right ?

02:53.887 --> 02:56.959
Well, then, Lucius...

02:57.127 --> 02:58.276
... we’re glad we met you.

02:58.487 --> 03:02.958
And if you aren’t yet, you will be.
Come on, let’s have some lunch, huh ?

03:03.127 --> 03:05.595
Everybody has to eat.
Come on. Right this way, please.

03:05.767 --> 03:08.201
Please. After you. Please.

03:09.327 --> 03:12.046
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.

03:12.487 --> 03:15.638
- Fair day. Fair day.
- Fair day.

03:20.727 --> 03:22.638
Here l come.

04:25.727 --> 04:29.322
l love architecture.
It’s all a mystery to me, really...

04:29.567 --> 04:32.684
- ... but hasn’t stopped me from trying.
- l see.

04:32.847 --> 04:34.963
- Is she taken yet ?
- No.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.681
Nor does he, nor anyone else,
speak for me.

04:37.887 --> 04:39.036
Oh, yeah.

04:39.207 --> 04:41.323
Yeah, you are definitely
wife material.

04:41.527 --> 04:44.041
Yeah, l love a woman with spirit.

04:44.207 --> 04:45.276
And a great body.

04:46.127 --> 04:47.799
Excuse me, Lucius.

04:47.967 --> 04:50.356
Please pardon my ignorance,
possibly even my manners.

04:50.527 --> 04:52.085
- What is it about you-- ?
- l know...

04:52.287 --> 04:54.278
... so you don’t even have to ask.

04:54.847 --> 04:56.200
l have gifts.

04:58.807 --> 05:03.039
What are those gifts ?

05:03.647 --> 05:05.285
Exploration.

05:05.447 --> 05:07.085
Alchemy, medicine.

05:07.287 --> 05:10.040
l have, l have to say,
some of the best ointments around.

05:12.207 --> 05:14.482
See, l could take care of that
just like that.

05:14.687 --> 05:16.484
- It’s just a cold.
- Nevertheless.

05:16.687 --> 05:19.997
l have a potion that could
get rid of that in six or seven days.

05:20.247 --> 05:23.842
- That’s impressive.
- You get used to it. We’Il do a trade.

05:24.047 --> 05:26.083
So where y’all from ?

05:26.247 --> 05:28.363
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.

05:28.527 --> 05:31.246
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, l saw it. l was on a walk.

05:31.407 --> 05:36.117
l look up and l heard-- Somebody said
that you flew through the ancestral ring ?

05:36.327 --> 05:37.396
Yeah, that was us.

05:37.607 --> 05:39.199
How does it fly ?

05:39.367 --> 05:42.564
- It’s complicated. One has to--
- Where do you get a machine like that ?

05:42.727 --> 05:46.356
l mean, it’s a wonderful way to travel.
Can l get one ? Are they hard to fly ?

05:46.527 --> 05:50.440
Yes, they are hard to fly,
and no, you can’t have one.

05:52.567 --> 05:53.636
But l want one.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.845
Please.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.005
Sorry.

05:58.327 --> 06:01.205
Well, perhaps a trade for some of
his wonderful medicines ?

06:01.407 --> 06:03.602
- Or perhaps not.
- What ? You come all this way...

06:03.767 --> 06:05.439
... you don’t even wanna do a trade ?

06:05.607 --> 06:07.916
Doesn’t have to be the ship.
l don’t want it.

06:08.087 --> 06:09.998
You gotta have some other stuff
to trade.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.045
Okay, like, how do you get your hair
to go like that ?

06:17.407 --> 06:21.116
Lunch was great, but l just realized
we’re running late.

06:21.327 --> 06:24.444
- For what ?
- For that important thing.

06:24.647 --> 06:27.081
Yes, as much as we’d love
to stay, we really must go.

06:27.247 --> 06:29.397
No. l don’t want you to go.
You just got here.

06:29.567 --> 06:31.285
We haven’t had the second course.

06:31.487 --> 06:33.318
Please, l want you to see
my medicines.

06:33.487 --> 06:35.921
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go. Run. Go.

06:36.127 --> 06:38.322
- Another time, Lucius. We gotta go.
- No.

06:38.527 --> 06:39.960
No, l don’t want you to leave.

06:42.487 --> 06:44.398
Okay, okay, okay.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.639
All right. Let them go.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.759
We’re all friends here, right ?

06:53.127 --> 06:56.756
Tell you what. Soon as we get back,
we’Il tell our medical people...

06:56.927 --> 06:59.999
... to come see what you have to offer,
then we’Il talk about trade.

07:00.167 --> 07:01.805
- Later today, maybe ?
- Maybe.

07:01.967 --> 07:03.923
- l’Il have everything ready.
- Thank you.

07:04.087 --> 07:05.315
You won’t be disappointed.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.478
Nice people.

07:12.887 --> 07:15.959
- l think the word we’re looking for is--
- Obnoxious ? Unctuous ?

07:16.127 --> 07:17.480
Either one of those works.

07:17.647 --> 07:20.684
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.

07:20.847 --> 07:24.556
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might
be worth having Beckett check out.

07:24.727 --> 07:27.241
l’m sure Carson will be able
to get us an answer soon.

07:27.407 --> 07:29.921
- So it’s back out to scout for gates ?
- Yes. Right away.

07:30.087 --> 07:32.203
It’s not a race, Rodney.

07:34.007 --> 07:36.475
Some of the herbs were gathered
from this planet...

07:36.647 --> 07:40.083
... but most were collected from
my many excursions to other worlds.

07:40.247 --> 07:41.965
l have to confess...

07:42.127 --> 07:46.245
... l have concocted remedies
for almost every known ailment.

07:46.407 --> 07:49.763
- Every single one ?
- Well, every one in town.

07:50.007 --> 07:51.645
The sick have been cured.

07:51.807 --> 07:53.684
The lame can walk again.

07:53.887 --> 07:58.403
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl
a lot faster than they used to.

07:59.047 --> 08:01.277
- l see.
- Nothing pleases me more...

08:01.447 --> 08:04.484
... than when someone comes up to me,
they say,« ou » ?Thank you, Lucius.

08:04.647 --> 08:08.356
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man. »

08:09.727 --> 08:12.525
Young, old, women.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.637
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett ?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.198
What ? Yes, of course.

08:19.407 --> 08:21.045
Yeah, l have a potion...

08:21.207 --> 08:24.597
... that will have them lined up,
just waiting to be with you.

08:24.767 --> 08:25.802
You know what l mean...

08:25.967 --> 08:28.481
- ... when l say « be with you, » right ?
- l think so, yes.

08:28.687 --> 08:30.359
l will trade you that potion...

08:30.527 --> 08:33.087
... for what you are holding
in your bag right now.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.398
My medical kit ?

08:37.967 --> 08:39.764
l thought you cured
every known ailment.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.481
Every known ailment in town.
l added that, remember ?

08:44.687 --> 08:49.363
Well, it is tempting, but l’m afraid
l couldn’t do that, Lucius. Sorry.

08:50.047 --> 08:51.196
Not yet, anyway, huh ?

08:51.807 --> 08:53.286
Come on. You must be starving.

08:53.487 --> 08:56.126
l have a great meal lined up for us.

08:59.847 --> 09:01.838
How did the scout go ?

09:02.927 --> 09:06.920
Well, we found an unused gate
in orbit over M3R-428.

09:07.087 --> 09:09.920
One lousy gate. We’re never
gonna meet our quota at this rate.

09:10.127 --> 09:12.516
- What quota ?
- My quota.

09:12.687 --> 09:14.598
<i>Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.</i>

09:14.767 --> 09:17.201
We won’t be able to harvest gates
till it can fly.

09:17.647 --> 09:20.445
Did Beckett bring back
anything worth anything ?

09:20.647 --> 09:22.080
No, he hasn’t returned yet.

09:22.327 --> 09:24.887
He radioed in earlier,
said he’d like to stay longer.

09:25.047 --> 09:27.356
Apparently he’s found
something of interest.

09:28.287 --> 09:30.847
The baby was frozen solid.

09:31.007 --> 09:32.838
Like a statue.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.680
Like a frozen statue.

09:35.847 --> 09:38.156
It must have been in the water for,
l don’t know...

09:38.327 --> 09:41.444
... what seemed like an eternity.
l didn’t know what to do.

09:41.607 --> 09:43.916
You know, l was a kid myself.

09:44.087 --> 09:45.679
l take the baby...

09:45.847 --> 09:49.635
... and l open my coat
and l tuck the baby inside.

09:49.807 --> 09:53.117
And l start stroking the baby’s back.

09:53.287 --> 09:55.118
Gently.

09:55.567 --> 09:57.558
Now, l don’t know...

09:57.727 --> 10:00.116
... whether it was the warmth
of my body...

10:00.287 --> 10:05.202
... or the steady, insistent rhythm
of my own life force...

10:05.767 --> 10:10.238
... urging this tiny baby’s heart
to begin beating again...

10:11.207 --> 10:13.562
... but beat it did.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.163
And a cry arose...

10:16.527 --> 10:19.325
... piercing the cold night air...

10:19.647 --> 10:21.922
... as if to say...

10:22.767 --> 10:27.158
...« ou » ?l am alive. »

10:31.967 --> 10:33.446
Astonishing.

10:33.687 --> 10:34.756
And that baby...

10:35.567 --> 10:39.640
That baby grew up to be...

10:40.167 --> 10:42.283
That beautiful young lady.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.762
No, no, not her, not her. Behind her.

10:48.407 --> 10:52.446
Maybe a little brain-damaged,
but just a little, but the story is true.

10:52.647 --> 10:55.525
And thank you for sharing it with me.

10:55.727 --> 10:57.843
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.

10:58.007 --> 10:59.998
That’s what l like doing most :

11:00.167 --> 11:01.998
To share.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.124
To share me.

11:05.727 --> 11:06.955
And l can see that now.

11:07.127 --> 11:09.357
You see ? All you had to do
was get to know me.

11:09.527 --> 11:10.926
You know, Carson--

11:11.087 --> 11:12.759
- May l call you Carson ?
- Of course.

11:12.927 --> 11:15.316
This city that you keep
going on and on about--

11:15.487 --> 11:16.886
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.

11:17.047 --> 11:19.880
On a scale of one to 10,
this village being a three--

11:20.047 --> 11:21.799
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.116
- It is ?
- Oh, yeah.

11:23.327 --> 11:25.522
And those flying ships,
you still have those ?

11:25.687 --> 11:27.405
You mean the Jumpers ?
We have several.

11:27.567 --> 11:30.525
Oh, yeah. How interesting.
Tell me more.

11:30.687 --> 11:34.362
Ach, Lucius, l think l could do
much better than that.

11:35.647 --> 11:36.636
Incoming wormhole.

11:37.047 --> 11:40.357
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett’s IDC.

11:40.527 --> 11:42.358
It’s about time.

11:44.887 --> 11:46.684
Carson.

11:52.847 --> 11:55.236
Oh, my ! When you said
this place was a 10...

11:55.407 --> 12:00.242
... l thought,« ou » ?Okay, maybe it’s an eight
and a half, » but this...

12:00.407 --> 12:02.557
- Carson ?
- Oh, Dr. Weir...

12:02.767 --> 12:05.884
... permit me
to introduce Lucius Luvin.

12:07.687 --> 12:09.006
Speaking of stunning...

12:09.927 --> 12:11.883
You never told me anything about her.

12:12.727 --> 12:15.799
Oh, yeah. Yeah...

12:16.007 --> 12:18.202
... l am definitely gonna like it here.

12:22.287 --> 12:24.926
l can’t believe you brought him here
without permission.

12:25.087 --> 12:28.124
- l didn’t think you’d mind.
- You didn’t think l’d mind ?

12:28.287 --> 12:31.563
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.

12:31.727 --> 12:33.365
There’s so much he can offer us.

12:33.527 --> 12:36.246
This the same guy who said
he could cure my cold in a week ?

12:36.407 --> 12:38.125
l know my business, Colonel Sheppard.

12:38.287 --> 12:41.563
He happens to have created several
medicines that are quite remarkable.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.605
- Really ? That guy ?
- Aye.

12:44.767 --> 12:48.077
He also possesses many valuable herbs
and spices and gourds.

12:48.487 --> 12:51.479
- Did you just say gourds ?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.605
We don’t know everything,
despite what you may think.

12:54.967 --> 12:58.039
He could prove
to be a very powerful ally.

12:58.447 --> 13:00.517
He’s a very wise and kind man.

13:02.647 --> 13:04.285
Are you feeling all right ?

13:04.727 --> 13:06.080
What do you mean ?

13:06.247 --> 13:09.683
- It’s just, you’re acting a little...
- Smitten ?

13:09.847 --> 13:12.077
l had another word in mind.

13:12.287 --> 13:14.960
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn’t.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.556
You’ve brought a stranger
without prior approval.

13:17.727 --> 13:20.366
Now he knows about the city,
as well as our gate address.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.637
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.

13:23.207 --> 13:26.404
He comes in peace. As our friend.

13:26.567 --> 13:29.365
You have his word and mine on that.

13:33.047 --> 13:35.686
- Do you think he poses a threat ?
- Definitely a nuisance.

13:35.847 --> 13:38.998
If what Beckett says is correct,
these medicines could be of value.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.681
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and l are heading out.

13:41.847 --> 13:45.760
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him
out of their sight.

13:49.687 --> 13:51.405
Here we are.

13:55.887 --> 13:57.957
It’s perfect.

13:59.647 --> 14:02.320
Because you could have
my personal quarters if you wanted.

14:02.527 --> 14:06.725
Oh, no, no. Don’t be silly, Carson.
l mean, you know...

14:06.887 --> 14:09.720
... l’Il take a look at what you have,
if you insist...

14:09.887 --> 14:11.445
... but this’Il do fine for now.

14:11.607 --> 14:15.520
Oh, good. l’m so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.

14:15.727 --> 14:18.525
l can’t think of anything l want more
than just being here.

14:20.367 --> 14:22.278
Except that--

14:24.287 --> 14:25.561
What ?

14:25.727 --> 14:27.843
- No, it’s nothing.
- No, tell me.

14:28.407 --> 14:31.763
Well, l get the feeling that your friends
don’t like having me around.

14:31.967 --> 14:35.243
Oh, Lucius. Just give them a chance
to get to know you.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.683
- Well, l just hope l get that chance.
- Oh, you will, l promise.

14:38.847 --> 14:40.997
l’m sure Dr. Weir
will want to negotiate...

14:41.167 --> 14:43.317
... an alliance between
your people and ours.

14:43.487 --> 14:44.681
- Really ?
- Really.

14:45.047 --> 14:46.924
Oh, that’d be great.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.637
Hello. l was gonna go get
something to eat.

14:53.807 --> 14:57.117
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk ?

14:57.287 --> 14:59.642
Guests are not permitted
to move about unescorted.

14:59.807 --> 15:01.957
Well, what do you say
you escort me, then ?

15:02.167 --> 15:03.998
- You don’t like me yet, do you ?
- Yet ?

15:04.167 --> 15:05.600
l’m sorry. My manners fail...

15:05.767 --> 15:08.486
... when l am in the presence
of a beautiful woman.

15:08.687 --> 15:10.996
- Isn’t she something, huh ?
- Yeah.

15:11.167 --> 15:13.601
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no. Come on.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.520
- Don’t make me sit all alone. Please ?
- We’Il both take you.

15:16.687 --> 15:19.759
Both. Both is good. Yeah, we’Il get
to know each other, then, okay ?

15:19.967 --> 15:22.686
Like, how do you get your hair
to go like that ?

15:23.287 --> 15:26.359
Just listen to what he has to say.

15:26.527 --> 15:29.405
Thank you. Fine. l must say,
l’m starting to get concerned...

15:29.567 --> 15:31.842
... about your interest in this man.
It seems...

15:32.007 --> 15:33.042
... excessive.

15:33.207 --> 15:36.756
And l find it puzzling why you’ve chosen
to greet Lucius with such hostility.

15:36.927 --> 15:39.441
Perhaps it’s because
you broke protocol, endangering--

15:39.607 --> 15:43.122
And for that, l am sorry, but can we
please move on past that one mistake...

15:43.287 --> 15:46.359
... and not further alienate
a potential ally ?

15:48.207 --> 15:49.925
Fine.

15:50.087 --> 15:51.759
Have him come up to my office.

15:55.047 --> 15:57.322
Hello, Dr. Weir.

16:01.247 --> 16:04.922
Hello, Dr. Weir. Yeah.

16:24.167 --> 16:27.125
Hello, Dr. Weir. Thank you
for granting me this audience.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.720
It’s hardly that, Mr. Luvin.

16:28.887 --> 16:31.321
No, please. Lucius.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.163
May this be the first of many gifts...

16:36.887 --> 16:39.321
... that our people exchange.

16:40.007 --> 16:41.201
Thank you.

16:41.407 --> 16:42.442
l made it myself.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.687
The gourd is from the marshes
of my home world...

16:45.847 --> 16:49.123
... topped with a candle that’s made
from the congealed tallow...

16:49.487 --> 16:50.636
... of an animal...

16:50.847 --> 16:53.566
... that l killed with my bare hands.

16:56.647 --> 16:57.762
How nice.

16:58.087 --> 16:59.281
It’s nothing.

16:59.487 --> 17:02.081
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.

17:10.607 --> 17:11.756
What are you doing ?

17:15.166 --> 17:19.160
l was told that you’d like to negotiate
an alliance between our two peoples.

17:19.527 --> 17:23.156
An alliance ? Okay. Sure.

17:23.327 --> 17:25.318
That’s why l’m here,
is to talk about that.

17:25.926 --> 17:30.717
Well, then, why don’t you start
by telling me what you have to offer us ?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.203
Besides candles.

17:37.567 --> 17:39.159
Right.

17:39.687 --> 17:42.485
One tiny settlement
on the entire planet ?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.917
Look, all we’d have to do
is relocate them.

17:45.087 --> 17:49.126
We’re not evacuating an entire planet
so we can take their gate.

17:49.287 --> 17:51.847
Hey. Welcome back.

17:52.007 --> 17:53.759
Where’s Zelenka ?

17:54.127 --> 17:56.322
- Well, he’s not here.
- No.

17:56.487 --> 17:58.398
No one’s here.

17:58.887 --> 18:00.206
Where is everyone ?

18:02.407 --> 18:04.682
l’m standing outside.
l don’t know what to do.

18:04.887 --> 18:07.640
l ran. l ran. l ran.

18:07.807 --> 18:10.446
And, mind you, l’m the guy
who’s holding the weapon, okay ?

18:10.647 --> 18:12.922
So here’s what l do. Okay.
l’m standing there...

18:13.087 --> 18:16.443
... and l’m running and l see the beast
just coming towards me...

18:16.607 --> 18:20.122
... so l just step to my left, l turn around,
and just as he’s coming to me...

18:20.327 --> 18:22.204
... l take my sword, l draw it...

18:22.407 --> 18:26.798
... and l lop off its head. And-- Yeah.
And l bend over, l pick it up...

18:27.007 --> 18:29.521
... and l walk in triumph
back to the village.

18:29.727 --> 18:30.762
- Amazing.
- You didn’t.

18:30.927 --> 18:35.318
Oh, yes, my giant friend,
l did, and let me tell you this :

18:35.727 --> 18:39.356
l had no trouble finding
female companionship that night.

18:39.527 --> 18:40.721
If you know what l mean.

18:44.127 --> 18:45.560
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.

18:47.647 --> 18:48.716
Yeah.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.323
Yeah.

19:00.887 --> 19:02.684
What the hell is going on ?

19:03.847 --> 19:05.599
What do you mean ?

19:05.767 --> 19:08.759
What do l mean ?
We leave for a few hours...

19:08.927 --> 19:11.395
... and Lucius turns you all
into Stepford wives.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.205
What did he do to you ?

19:13.367 --> 19:15.244
Absolutely nothing.

19:15.407 --> 19:17.079
Carson was right about him.

19:17.247 --> 19:20.444
l agree. He has much to offer us.

19:20.647 --> 19:21.875
Herbs and gourds ?

19:22.047 --> 19:25.119
Please. The medicines alone
are worth whatever he asks.

19:25.287 --> 19:27.278
The ointment is worth something ?

19:27.487 --> 19:30.524
- l haven’t actually tested it.
- You’re taking his word for it ?

19:30.727 --> 19:34.117
- You got a problem with that ?
- Me ? No. He might.

19:34.847 --> 19:38.760
Teyla, this is the man who asked you
to be his seventh wife.

19:39.927 --> 19:43.044
l know. l hope l didn’t upset him.

19:43.207 --> 19:45.721
You just haven’t taken the time
to get to know Lucius.

19:45.927 --> 19:47.645
Carson is right. Again.

19:48.527 --> 19:50.722
Look, l think he could be
a great asset to us.

19:50.927 --> 19:53.316
He has traveled extensively
throughout this galaxy...

19:53.487 --> 19:55.955
... and gathered a tremendous amount
of intelligence.

19:56.407 --> 19:58.796
Has he shared any of this intelligence ?

19:59.207 --> 20:01.402
Not yet...

20:01.647 --> 20:03.683
... but he did give me this.

20:06.567 --> 20:09.718
A very wise and kind man.

20:10.087 --> 20:11.600
This is creeping me out.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.600
<i>Yeah. Reminds me of an old
Batman episode, actually.</i>

20:15.767 --> 20:18.235
Catwoman used a drug to put
a spell on Batman...

20:18.407 --> 20:23.083
... make him fall in love with her. Ended
up doing all sorts of evil things for her.

20:23.687 --> 20:26.485
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit--

20:26.647 --> 20:28.922
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.

20:29.087 --> 20:30.884
- Really ?
- Yeah. You didn’t know that ?

20:33.487 --> 20:38.436
Oh, so anyway, l did
a little investigating, and...

20:38.887 --> 20:41.162
Surveillance footage from his quarters.

20:47.527 --> 20:52.157
- What’s this ?
- l took the liberty of searching his room.

20:52.447 --> 20:54.677
There’s some residue
from the liquid in the vial.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.803
It’Il take some time
to break it down.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.037
l could have used Carson’s help
on this, but--

20:59.207 --> 21:01.357
He’s off picking daffodils
for his new friend.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.119
Right.

21:05.647 --> 21:07.205
That’s brilliant.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.323
This is actually
how we found your planet.

21:09.807 --> 21:12.526
So you fly to a planet,
you take the gate, you fly away.

21:12.687 --> 21:15.804
We try to take stargates that are
in fixed orbit around a planet...

21:15.967 --> 21:18.322
... and then, only if the planet
is uninhabited.

21:18.487 --> 21:22.799
It wouldn’t be right to take a gate from
a world that depended on it for trade.

21:22.967 --> 21:26.437
Wait a minute.
l’ve heard of this planet.

21:26.607 --> 21:28.802
- You have ?
- Yeah, l have...

21:29.007 --> 21:31.726
... and l heard that this planet
is completely uninhabited.

21:31.887 --> 21:32.922
It’s what l heard.

21:33.087 --> 21:36.443
l don’t know about you guys, but l got
a good feeling about this planet.

21:36.847 --> 21:40.078
Well, then we could retrofit the gate
for space deployment.

21:41.687 --> 21:44.201
Beautiful and brilliant.

21:45.087 --> 21:47.396
The two B’s.

21:47.567 --> 21:48.966
Dr. Weir.

21:49.127 --> 21:52.802
Oh, hi, John. We were just discussing
the gate-harvesting program.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.362
- Yeah, l heard.
- And Lucius knows...

21:55.527 --> 21:58.200
... of an excellent planet
we should investigate.

21:58.407 --> 21:59.840
l heard that too.

22:00.007 --> 22:03.204
We got intel that the Wraith
recently set up a major outpost there.

22:03.367 --> 22:04.846
An alliance of three hives.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.718
- No. Really ?
- Has your intel been verified ?

22:08.927 --> 22:13.876
We haven’t put boots on the ground, no,
but our contacts are trustworthy.

22:14.087 --> 22:17.762
Not gonna send a team down there when
there’s still plenty of gates to scout.

22:18.647 --> 22:22.162
John, you are
way behind Rodney’s quota.

22:22.367 --> 22:24.517
Forget Rodney’s quota.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.600
l am not sending a team
into harm’s way.

22:27.807 --> 22:30.241
You know what ?
Colonel Sheppard is right.

22:30.447 --> 22:32.677
Don’t get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons...

22:32.847 --> 22:36.442
... you could easily dispose of a tiny
Wraith outpost, if there even is one.

22:36.887 --> 22:38.240
But ultimately...

22:38.447 --> 22:42.281
... is it worth the risk ?
No matter how small that risk may be.

22:42.447 --> 22:45.757
- Sure, people may label you a coward--
- Will you knock it off ?

22:46.087 --> 22:47.600
Colonel.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.685
l think it’s worth investigating.

22:49.847 --> 22:52.042
No. l won’t allow it.

22:52.567 --> 22:55.525
John, are you questioning
my authority ?

22:55.727 --> 22:59.766
Yeah, when it comes to the security
of this base, you’re damn right l am.

23:00.647 --> 23:04.037
From now on,
no one goes through that gate...

23:04.207 --> 23:07.040
... without my authorization.

23:11.407 --> 23:14.205
What a terrible cold he must have.

23:14.367 --> 23:17.677
This is not like him, Lucius.

23:17.847 --> 23:19.883
l apologize.

23:20.047 --> 23:22.641
He makes me uncomfortable.

23:23.047 --> 23:25.003
He’s really a good man.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.078
l don’t see it.

23:28.967 --> 23:32.516
If he doesn’t come around,
you’re gonna have to do something.

23:41.047 --> 23:44.483
Élizabeth wants to send a team
to check out a gate...

23:44.647 --> 23:47.002
- ... at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts ?

23:47.207 --> 23:49.357
Everybody’s nuts, Rodney.
Haven’t you noticed ?

23:49.567 --> 23:52.035
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.

23:52.207 --> 23:54.437
l’m working on it,
but there’s not enough liquid.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.802
- l need more.
- l’Il go back to Lucius’village.

23:56.967 --> 24:00.004
- l’m sure he keeps a stash.
- You’re leaving me here alone ?

24:00.207 --> 24:01.765
You said you need the liquid.

24:01.927 --> 24:04.760
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody’s gotta stay.

24:04.927 --> 24:06.042
Keep away from the nuts.

24:06.207 --> 24:10.564
Disable the DHD as soon as l’m gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay ?

24:25.927 --> 24:27.406
Willa.

24:28.167 --> 24:31.045
Sheppard. Sheppard.

24:32.287 --> 24:34.801
- Are you all right ?
- Where is he ?

24:34.967 --> 24:37.117
- Lucius ?
- Did you take him ?

24:37.287 --> 24:39.357
Of course, if you did, we’re not angry.

24:39.727 --> 24:41.479
He came to my planet on his own.

24:41.647 --> 24:45.526
Please send him back. It hurts us
to be away from him for so long.

24:46.207 --> 24:48.926
Have you always felt
this way about him ?

24:49.087 --> 24:51.078
No, but one day...

24:51.247 --> 24:54.364
... as he returned from trading his wares
with a distant people...

24:54.567 --> 24:58.196
... he told me a story,
a wonderful wise, sweet story...

24:58.367 --> 25:00.927
... about something
he accidentally stepped in.

25:01.127 --> 25:02.480
And from that day forward...

25:02.687 --> 25:04.917
... we saw him for the wonderful man
he truly is.

25:05.327 --> 25:07.443
And before that ?

25:07.887 --> 25:11.675
l am ashamed to admit that l refused
to share his bed more than once...

25:12.447 --> 25:15.200
... and since he is gone,
everyone is growing sick.

25:15.367 --> 25:18.518
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.

25:18.687 --> 25:23.158
Have you ever seen him drink,
like, a liquid from a small vial ?

25:23.367 --> 25:25.278
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more ?

25:25.447 --> 25:27.438
- l could bring it to him.
- We both can.

25:27.647 --> 25:28.966
l can handle it.

25:29.127 --> 25:32.164
Well, if we get you some,
will you bring him home ?

25:32.687 --> 25:34.040
Sure.

25:37.567 --> 25:40.400
<i>Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard’s IDC.</i>

25:43.927 --> 25:46.805
l did. l jumped in. l jump
in the marsh and l’m looking...

25:46.967 --> 25:51.006
... at four of them. l know,
l mean, four of them there...

25:51.167 --> 25:54.603
- ... and l don’t know which one to save.
- What did you do ?

25:54.887 --> 25:58.118
And the next day,
she became my wife.

25:58.287 --> 26:01.757
My fifth wife, and now l have six.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.758
You are a scoundrel.
That’s what you are.

26:04.207 --> 26:05.640
Come here. You gotta hear this.

26:05.807 --> 26:07.843
Lucius was telling
the most hysterical story.

26:08.007 --> 26:10.043
You know they have marmots
on his planet ?

26:10.207 --> 26:12.801
They’re not marmots, exactly,
but it’s a rodent similar--

26:12.967 --> 26:16.926
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, l tried to keep to myself...

26:17.087 --> 26:20.045
... but Lucius here was concerned for me,
so he just came down--

26:20.207 --> 26:23.563
Ronon held me against the wall.
- -and Lucius and l had a nice, long talk.

26:23.767 --> 26:25.883
- Oh, you did ?
- And let me tell you...

26:26.047 --> 26:27.685
... we have nothing to worry about.

26:27.847 --> 26:30.919
This guy’s just a big knucklehead.
Aren’t you, you big knucklehead ?

26:32.247 --> 26:33.282
Where’s Élizabeth ?

26:33.727 --> 26:35.445
She’s out making me
something to eat.

26:35.767 --> 26:38.122
- What ?
- l don’t know. She said it was a surprise.

26:38.287 --> 26:40.881
So Rodney and l were waiting here
for the team to return.

26:41.047 --> 26:43.561
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.683
They volunteered
to check out M6H-491.

26:45.887 --> 26:47.764
- l told you--
- Disable the DHD, l know.

26:47.927 --> 26:49.724
l’m sorry, l didn’t. But come on...

26:49.887 --> 26:51.798
... Ronon and Teyla can handle
themselves.

26:51.967 --> 26:54.765
- What about Beckett ?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.

26:54.927 --> 26:57.521
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.

26:57.687 --> 26:59.359
He was down on his hands...

26:59.527 --> 27:00.801
McKay.

27:03.927 --> 27:06.646
We don’t know for sure
that there are Wraith on the planet.

27:06.847 --> 27:08.565
We’Il find out soon enough,
won’t we ?

27:08.727 --> 27:10.399
We sure will.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.240
<i>Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We’re coming in hot.</i>

27:30.967 --> 27:33.481
- You all right ?
- It was a little rough, but we’re good.

27:33.687 --> 27:35.279
It was all terribly exciting.

27:35.447 --> 27:39.156
Well, l guess we can assume
there are Wraith on that planet.

27:39.327 --> 27:41.079
Yes. Many.

27:41.287 --> 27:43.039
Now, don’t overreact, John.

27:43.207 --> 27:44.640
Are you kidding me ?

27:44.807 --> 27:47.844
You send a team led by Beckett...

27:48.007 --> 27:50.805
... to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react ?

27:50.967 --> 27:52.844
Well, firstly, they volunteered.

27:53.047 --> 27:55.163
And secondly, we got the herb.

27:57.887 --> 28:03.200
Carson, l will tell people of the tale
of your bravery for many years to come.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.844
- You will ?
- Yes, l will.

28:07.967 --> 28:09.798
You sent them to get an herb ?

28:10.007 --> 28:11.042
We wanted to go.

28:11.247 --> 28:14.398
Okay. l’ve just about had enough.

28:16.607 --> 28:17.756
Don’t touch it.

28:23.447 --> 28:25.802
What on earth is wrong with you,
John ?

28:26.567 --> 28:28.762
We were just helping a friend.

28:29.647 --> 28:32.081
And there’s nothing wrong with that.

28:33.047 --> 28:36.164
l think there’s something wrong
with him.

28:39.807 --> 28:41.445
You know what ?

28:42.007 --> 28:45.602
l’m just tired. It’s this damn cold.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.362
l apologize.

28:50.007 --> 28:51.440
Maybe you should get some rest.

28:51.807 --> 28:54.799
You’re probably right.
l just need a good night’s sleep.

29:11.927 --> 29:12.916
What does this do ?

29:13.127 --> 29:15.038
That engages the HUD,
Heads Up Display.

29:15.207 --> 29:17.562
Heads up. l love that.

29:17.727 --> 29:19.877
It gives me information
when flying the Jumper :

29:20.087 --> 29:22.123
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing ?

29:22.327 --> 29:23.680
- l can fly it too.
- Yes.

29:23.847 --> 29:26.566
Now that you received
the ATA therapy, which l invented.

29:26.727 --> 29:29.366
l was born with a gene
which makes me more proficient...

29:29.527 --> 29:32.485
- ... at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn’t fly any better.

29:32.647 --> 29:34.763
- Don’t you lie--
- All right, all right. Boys...

29:34.927 --> 29:37.839
... stop fighting. A gene, you say ?

29:38.047 --> 29:40.959
It’s a genetic fingerprint, if you will,
which allows someone...

29:41.127 --> 29:43.163
... to operate any technology
on Atlantis.

29:43.567 --> 29:45.762
l developed an inoculation
which allows those...

29:45.927 --> 29:49.442
... who don’t naturally possess the gene,
such as Dr. McKay, to use it.

29:49.607 --> 29:53.964
Really ? A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh ? That’s great.

29:54.447 --> 29:57.325
You know what’s really interesting.
If you look at this here...

30:02.127 --> 30:03.640
Doc ?

30:04.087 --> 30:05.725
Could l speak with you
for a sec ?

30:05.887 --> 30:07.718
Excuse me.

30:12.967 --> 30:18.121
l think there might be
something wrong with me.

30:19.967 --> 30:21.480
It’s all right, son.

30:21.647 --> 30:24.525
Admitting it is the first step.

30:30.087 --> 30:32.157
So you finally came around, did you ?

30:32.327 --> 30:35.876
Once you get a chance to know Lucius,
he’s really a very wise and kind--

30:36.047 --> 30:37.321
Oh, crap.

30:40.847 --> 30:43.315
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening ?

30:43.487 --> 30:45.717
Jumper 3’s starting up. Who’s in it ?

30:45.887 --> 30:49.721
- l don’t know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.

30:49.887 --> 30:54.119
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself. Look, close the door.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.404
It’s too late. It’s left the bay.

31:05.607 --> 31:08.246
Hey, Carson. Sorry about that.

31:08.407 --> 31:09.965
What-- ? Why-- ?

31:10.167 --> 31:13.682
l’m taking you to the mainland.
It’s for your own good. Trust me.

31:16.087 --> 31:18.078
- How often does that happen ?
- Never.

31:18.247 --> 31:19.726
We have strict flight protocol--

31:19.887 --> 31:22.720
- He’d have to have a key--
- A security officer saw Sheppard...

31:22.887 --> 31:26.084
... carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay
before the Jumper took off.

31:26.247 --> 31:29.284
- So it was them in the flying machine ?
- My computer’s missing.

31:29.447 --> 31:32.883
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- l told you that man was dangerous.

31:33.047 --> 31:35.242
l have to say, l am very
disappointed right now.

31:35.407 --> 31:37.637
l am so very sorry, Lucius.

31:37.807 --> 31:39.877
Mobilize Jumper teams.
l want them found.

31:40.047 --> 31:41.446
Yes.

31:42.447 --> 31:45.245
They’re very good. They will find them.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.846
l need to get back.

31:51.007 --> 31:52.076
No, you don’t.

31:52.247 --> 31:55.239
Lucius needs me. You have no right
to abduct me like this.

31:55.407 --> 31:57.602
Call it an intervention.

31:57.967 --> 31:59.719
You probably don’t realize it now...

31:59.887 --> 32:05.120
... but what you’re going through
is kind of like a detox.

32:05.327 --> 32:08.444
Now, according to research
Rodney was able to do...

32:08.607 --> 32:10.962
... before joining the Lucius fan club...

32:11.127 --> 32:14.403
... that liquid he’s been drinking
contains some kind of a chemical.

32:14.967 --> 32:18.880
It interacts with the body
and causes a secretion of a pheromone...

32:19.047 --> 32:21.641
... and then there’s something
about gamma activity...

32:21.807 --> 32:23.399
... in the « prefrontral cortrex. »

32:23.567 --> 32:27.526
Prefrontal cortex. The part of the brain
responsible for positive emotions.

32:27.807 --> 32:30.958
See ? That’s why l need you.
It seems that when people are exposed...

32:31.127 --> 32:34.483
... to this pheromone in close proximity,
it makes them...

32:35.287 --> 32:37.642
... easy to influence.

32:37.807 --> 32:40.480
The longer they’re exposed,
the worse the addiction gets.

32:40.927 --> 32:43.236
You mean literally
an addictive personality ?

32:43.447 --> 32:44.846
That’s what it looks like.

32:46.167 --> 32:47.156
It’s rubbish.

32:47.847 --> 32:49.246
Check for yourself.

32:49.407 --> 32:52.319
l will bet you a year’s pay
that the liquid in that vial...

32:52.487 --> 32:56.082
... is some kind of an extract made
from the herb you collected for him.

32:56.247 --> 32:58.761
He made you his mule.

32:59.127 --> 33:01.163
If this is true,
why weren’t you affected ?

33:01.367 --> 33:03.005
My cold. l can hardly breathe.

33:03.247 --> 33:06.398
Plus, l haven’t been around him much.
Look.

33:07.447 --> 33:10.439
l would just kidnap him
and take him away somewhere...

33:10.607 --> 33:12.279
... till the pheromone wore off...

33:12.447 --> 33:15.359
... but the people back on his planet
are starting to get sick.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.121
It looks like they’re gonna get worse.
l don’t want to...

33:18.287 --> 33:21.916
- ... put our people through that.
- You’re doing it to me right now.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.685
Buck up, Carson.

33:24.847 --> 33:27.884
You haven’t been exposed that long.
Look, l need you...

33:28.087 --> 33:30.760
... to figure out a way
how to counteract this thing.

33:30.927 --> 33:33.316
There’s gotta be an antidote
of some kind.

33:36.447 --> 33:37.516
l can’t.

33:37.687 --> 33:40.406
Yes, you can.

33:40.567 --> 33:42.319
You can beat it.

33:44.247 --> 33:45.680
But he needs me.

33:51.847 --> 33:54.315
We should head back.
We’ve been searching for hours.

33:54.527 --> 33:55.960
We just left, McKay.

33:56.127 --> 33:59.164
l don’t like being this far away
from Atlantis. Lucius is worried.

33:59.327 --> 34:01.557
<i>- You think he’s worried ?
- Jumper 2, report.</i>

34:01.727 --> 34:03.763
We’re reading several life signs.

34:03.967 --> 34:06.606
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We’Il check them.

34:06.767 --> 34:11.716
<i>- Lucius worried about us ?
- Lucius ? He’s fine. Just keep looking.</i>

34:11.887 --> 34:13.764
l should have stayed with him.

34:20.567 --> 34:22.159
Wait just a minute.

34:22.327 --> 34:23.442
What is it ?

34:23.607 --> 34:25.643
Don’t move.

34:29.847 --> 34:33.362
- That thing’s set to stun, right ?
- Yeah.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.405
Good.

34:36.927 --> 34:38.280
Carson, are you all right ?

34:38.447 --> 34:41.917
l will be, once l get back to Lucius.

34:43.847 --> 34:45.199
What did you shoot him for ?

34:47.927 --> 34:51.476
Now we’re gonna have to carry him
all the way back to the Jumper.

35:02.367 --> 35:03.595
Good morning, colonel.

35:03.767 --> 35:06.042
l want to apologize
for this harsh treatment.

35:06.207 --> 35:08.118
l hate that Élizabeth had to do this.

35:08.327 --> 35:09.555
Cut the crap.

35:10.847 --> 35:12.166
So...

35:12.487 --> 35:13.920
... that herb of yours...

35:14.167 --> 35:16.362
One of my greatest discoveries.

35:16.527 --> 35:21.282
Well, it’s my only great discovery,
but you got to admit, it’s pretty great.

35:21.967 --> 35:23.525
How’d you get by before that ?

35:23.887 --> 35:26.959
l was a baker. Bread, mostly.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.197
The occasional muffin at festival time.

35:30.087 --> 35:32.078
So that herb
pretty much changed everything.

35:33.687 --> 35:35.279
Yeah.

35:35.727 --> 35:39.436
Yeah, l baked it into my own bread--
l like to experiment.

35:39.607 --> 35:42.804
- -and l noticed that people started
to like me. Well, hate me less...

35:42.967 --> 35:44.798
... but pretty soon it became like.

35:45.687 --> 35:47.040
So l perfected a potion.

35:47.247 --> 35:49.283
It worked great for years.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.961
Then the Wraith set up
an outpost on the only planet...

35:52.127 --> 35:53.958
... where l could get the herb.

35:54.127 --> 35:55.799
l knew l could never go back there.

35:56.407 --> 35:57.476
Then we showed up.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.078
l’m telling you, it was fate.

36:01.247 --> 36:03.966
And everybody wanted to help,
so l let them.

36:04.127 --> 36:06.766
See, that’s the great thing
about this herb.

36:06.927 --> 36:08.838
Nobody gets hurt.

36:09.007 --> 36:12.522
They just wanna help me all the time.
What’s wrong with that ?

36:13.047 --> 36:15.925
l’m a nice guy.
l never make them do anything...

36:16.087 --> 36:18.885
- ... they didn’t wanna do.
- Six wives.

36:19.087 --> 36:20.486
Sometimes all at once.

36:22.087 --> 36:24.885
When you get over this cold,
we’re gonna have a long chat.

36:25.047 --> 36:27.083
Face to face.

36:27.247 --> 36:30.239
And l got a feeling we’re
gonna become the best of friends.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.680
And you’re gonna wanna
help me too, all the time.

36:33.847 --> 36:34.996
And you’Il love it.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.845
Just a warning, Lucius.

36:38.007 --> 36:41.079
You get too close to me,
it’Il be the last thing you do.

36:41.247 --> 36:42.521
That’s all right, colonel.

36:43.047 --> 36:44.446
l’m in no rush.

36:44.607 --> 36:46.199
<i>Lucius ?</i>

36:47.167 --> 36:48.361
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.

36:48.527 --> 36:52.406
<i>-I’ve finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, l’Il be right down.</i>

36:52.647 --> 36:55.400
l gotta go get an inoculation.
We’Il talk after.

36:56.047 --> 37:01.997
- Giving you the ATA therapy ?
- Yeah. Isn’t that great ?

37:08.607 --> 37:10.677
There. All done.

37:10.847 --> 37:14.317
Now, remember, it’s only effective
in 47 percent of those who receive it.

37:14.487 --> 37:16.557
Well, l’m a naturally lucky fella.

37:16.727 --> 37:20.037
The only way to know for sure is to
have you try to operate something.

37:20.207 --> 37:21.401
Okay.

37:21.567 --> 37:23.364
It takes about an hour to be effective.

37:23.567 --> 37:27.321
In the meantime, just rest easy,
dear friend.

37:27.927 --> 37:29.599
Are you okay ?
Can l get you anything ?

37:30.007 --> 37:32.760
No, Rodney. l’m fine.

37:32.927 --> 37:34.042
- You sure ?
- Absolutely.

37:34.207 --> 37:37.563
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall. Blue Jell-O.

37:37.727 --> 37:40.639
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.

37:45.047 --> 37:47.356
We really should talk about marriage.

37:50.287 --> 37:52.039
Jumper 1, this is Flight.

37:52.247 --> 37:54.636
The bay doors are open.

37:54.967 --> 37:56.400
You are go for launch.

37:57.167 --> 38:00.204
« Go for launch. »
That’s so exciting. Thanks, Rodney.

38:00.407 --> 38:02.318
All right, here goes.

38:02.487 --> 38:04.284
- l’Il take it from here.
- What-- ?

38:06.087 --> 38:08.601
Wait. You’re supposed to be in jail.

38:08.767 --> 38:09.961
- Carson.
- Save your breath.

38:10.127 --> 38:12.038
Your charm no longer has
any effect on me.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.005
No. No, but, Carson...

38:18.127 --> 38:21.642
- We’re supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn’t give you the ATA gene.

38:21.847 --> 38:22.836
What ?

38:23.007 --> 38:26.716
It’s a serum that effectively neutralizes
the chemical in that herb of yours.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.479
Took some myself.

38:31.207 --> 38:32.606
l don’t know what that means.

38:32.767 --> 38:36.203
It means we can have that face-to-face
conversation you wanted us to have.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.003
The only thing that’Il happen
is you’Il catch my cold.

38:42.647 --> 38:46.037
What is taking him so long ?
Okay, l should go up there.

38:46.207 --> 38:47.686
Wait. Wait.

38:48.127 --> 38:49.196
They’re taking off.

38:54.087 --> 38:55.998
It worked.

38:59.327 --> 39:00.601
He’s flying it.

39:05.527 --> 39:08.485
Fly, Lucius, fly.

39:15.487 --> 39:18.604
- Where are you taking me ?
- Little vacation.

39:18.767 --> 39:23.841
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum
to my people without you interfering.

39:24.127 --> 39:25.719
And then what ?

39:26.167 --> 39:28.044
Then maybe l’Il take you back home.

39:28.207 --> 39:30.846
l’m sure your people will be thrilled
to see you again.

39:31.527 --> 39:33.483
You would do that for me ?

39:33.687 --> 39:36.679
Without even being
under the effect of the herb ?

39:37.847 --> 39:41.362
- After all l did ?
- Well, l’m a nice guy.

39:41.607 --> 39:44.724
Oh, colonel, l can’t thank you enough.
Thank you so much--

39:44.887 --> 39:47.401
After l give them the serum.

40:04.447 --> 40:06.915
So how was Lucius’homecoming ?

40:07.087 --> 40:08.440
Well, they didn’t kill him...

40:08.607 --> 40:11.167
... although l do see a string
of divorces in his future.

40:11.327 --> 40:13.045
If they haven’t strung him up first.

40:13.207 --> 40:16.324
The townspeople are over
their withdrawal. l doubt that’Il happen.

40:16.487 --> 40:20.844
That is, unless we discover he’s revealed
the location of Atlantis to anyone.

40:21.007 --> 40:22.918
In which case l said
l’d track him down...

40:23.087 --> 40:26.318
- ... hang him by his feet and cut off his--
- Thank you. We get the idea.

40:27.647 --> 40:30.719
So everyone here back to normal ?

40:32.567 --> 40:33.966
We’re still fine, John.

40:34.647 --> 40:36.922
No lingering desires ?

40:37.607 --> 40:39.837
Secret longings for his touch ?

40:40.127 --> 40:43.961
It’s embarrassing enough without you
constantly reminding us, thank you.

40:44.487 --> 40:46.398
All right, all right.

40:46.607 --> 40:50.361
Anyway, l better get back and clean
your quarters before the next scout.

40:51.007 --> 40:52.645
Right.

40:53.047 --> 40:54.639
Rodney.

40:55.647 --> 40:58.480
It was one teeny, tiny taste
for research purposes.

40:58.687 --> 40:59.676
- Burn it.
- All of it.

40:59.847 --> 41:01.360
Right now.

41:01.527 --> 41:04.803
Fine. Story of my life.
