<i>NARRATOR".
Another serene day in Gotham City.</i>

00:16.851 --> 00:22.315
<i>But on the terrace of a penthouse suite
atop the sky-high Gotham Arms...</i>

00:22.524 --> 00:25.151
<i>...storm clouds gather.</i>

00:25.360 --> 00:28.696
Puzzler, what if Artie Knabi
finds us in his penthouse?

00:28.905 --> 00:31.658
It's Artemus Knab, Rocket.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.576
He isn't due back till later today...

00:33.785 --> 00:36.579
...and I have a passkey.
I don't think he'd mind.

00:36.788 --> 00:38.665
You see, as Shakespeare would say:

00:38.873 --> 00:42.126
"We are birds of the selfsame feather."

00:42.335 --> 00:46.422
All right, Glider, Blimpy,
is the model plane ready to soar?

00:46.631 --> 00:48.967
- Just like you said, Puzzler.
- Ha, ha!

00:50.760 --> 00:54.806
Yes, this should
startle the pillars of the law.

00:55.014 --> 01:00.478
The caterpillars of the commonwealth
which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

01:00.687 --> 01:03.189
A quotation from the bard, Rocket.

01:03.398 --> 01:07.026
<i>- Phoo. Wow.
-King Richard II.</i>

01:07.235 --> 01:13.157
And I would particularly like to see it
sail through that window down there.

01:15.451 --> 01:19.247
I realize your prison facilities
are becoming overcrowded, Warden Crichton.

01:19.455 --> 01:23.042
Doubtless that could be attributed
to the efficiency of this department.

01:23.251 --> 01:24.752
Yeah.

01:24.961 --> 01:28.423
Me thinks I'll launch this myself.

01:42.395 --> 01:46.441
That? Well, for your information,
Warden Crichton, that was an explosion.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.693
Yes, right here in this office.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.571
Commissioner, are you all right?

01:53.740 --> 01:56.284
- What happened?
-I don't know.

01:56.492 --> 01:59.454
Model plane just sailed through the window
and dropped a bomb.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.247
Oh, a child's prank, no doubt.

02:01.456 --> 02:03.916
Some child. A window this high up?

02:04.125 --> 02:06.502
What's that? A message attached?

02:06.711 --> 02:10.465
Oh. Uh...

02:11.674 --> 02:14.844
"Forsooth, the puzzles are coming"?

02:17.388 --> 02:24.145
"I know a bank where the wild time blows,
inside out the puzzle goes."

02:24.937 --> 02:27.440
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking, Chief O'Hara?

02:27.649 --> 02:30.860
- Aren't I always, commissioner?
-Well, then.

02:31.694 --> 02:34.113
Sure, and who else could it be...

02:34.322 --> 02:38.826
...but the Puzzler himself
come to confound and confuse us?

02:39.035 --> 02:42.163
I know we've been working
the Caped Crusader overtime lately.

02:42.747 --> 02:46.042
But I feel I'd be shirking my duty
to the populous of Gotham City...

02:46.250 --> 02:48.795
...if I didn't call on his help
in this dire crisis.

02:55.385 --> 02:58.763
Why, Dick, it worked. Wren heard you.

03:01.432 --> 03:05.687
Yes, Dick,
your birdcalls are close to perfect.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.397
If more people practice them...

03:07.605 --> 03:11.984
...someday we might have a chance for real
communication with our feathered friends.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.029
In that case, I think I'll polish up
my ruby-crowned kinglet...

03:15.238 --> 03:17.907
...and my rose-breasted
yellow-tailed grosbeak calls.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.784
The Batphone, sir.

03:21.828 --> 03:26.666
Why don't you continue practicing
those calls out at White's Pond, Dick? Heh.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.294
White's Pond, Dick.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.506
I could get some fishing in
at the same time.

03:33.715 --> 03:35.299
Let's go.

03:37.218 --> 03:41.723
- Those two, always on the move.
-Youth, madam, youth.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.434
Yes, commissioner.

03:45.268 --> 03:46.853
Right away.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.439
To the Batpoles.

05:28.079 --> 05:30.206
There is no doubt about it, gentlemen.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.417
Puzzler's maleficent methods
are legendary.

05:33.626 --> 05:38.339
Plus the fact that they're usually connected
with an aviatic caper.

05:38.548 --> 05:41.259
Along with his Shakespearean touches.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.636
Holy Hamlet.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.305
In this particular instance...

05:46.514 --> 05:49.559
...it's the backward puzzle that intrigues me.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.687
- Backward, Batman?
-Yes, "I know a bank...

05:52.895 --> 05:58.818
...where the wild time blows,
inside out the puzzle goes."

05:59.026 --> 06:03.364
Maybe he's asking a question.
Like, "What will I rob next?"

06:03.573 --> 06:04.824
Perhaps.

06:05.032 --> 06:11.080
But we all know the Puzzler uses
reverse logic from--

06:11.289 --> 06:13.332
Reverse.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.876
Why, that's it.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.794
"Inside out."

06:17.003 --> 06:19.755
Robin, take the word bank
and spell it backwards.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.592
K-N-A-B. Knab.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.304
- Add A for Artemus.
-Holy deposit slip.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.931
Artemus Knab.
One of the richest men in the world.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.101
- And he's right here in Gotham City now.
-Correct, Robin.

06:32.310 --> 06:37.106
And some of Artemus Knab's millions
come from his aviation monopoly.

06:37.315 --> 06:39.025
Along with his many other monopolies.

06:39.233 --> 06:43.195
Gentlemen, I strongly suspect
that Puzzler's prime...

06:43.404 --> 06:45.740
...and present target is Artemus Knab.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.575
You've done it again, Batman.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.953
Chief O'Hara, take some men over
to Artemus Knab's penthouse suite...

06:51.162 --> 06:52.788
...at the Gotham Arms immediately.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.707
A moment, commissioner.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.710
May we handle this?
I welcome the opportunity...

06:57.919 --> 07:01.923
...to cross swords,
as it were, with Puzzler.

07:02.131 --> 07:05.426
And we won't attract as much attention
as a police squad moving in.

07:05.635 --> 07:07.970
By all means, Batman,
if that's the way you want it.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.097
We haven't a moment to lose, Robin.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.642
Whoever they are beneath those masks--

07:12.850 --> 07:14.602
You've said that before, commissioner.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.146
And I'll say it to my dying day,
Chief O'Hara.

07:17.355 --> 07:22.026
Gotham City owes the Dynamic Duo
a debt which can never be repaid.

07:22.234 --> 07:28.032
Well, if this Artemus Knab is as rich
as they say, maybe he can help a little.

07:31.118 --> 07:36.248
That's what I said, sell. I don't care
what happens to the market.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.085
I'll give you 5200 for Park Place
and not a penny more.

07:39.293 --> 07:43.047
- Six thousand.
-Fifty-eight now, two when I pass Go. Move.

07:45.174 --> 07:48.386
Yes. Did you get a quote
on Pan Uranium?

07:48.594 --> 07:53.474
Good, buy all you can get.
I don't know how, just buy it.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.978
And I'll give you 5000 for Boardwalk.

08:00.606 --> 08:01.941
Yes.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.653
What do you mean, you can't find
a 200-foot diesel yacht?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.239
I don't know how, just find it.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.326
This castle hath a pleasant seat.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.914
Yes.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.250
So the movie is 5 million over budget.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.336
Who cares? It's my 5 million.
Keep shooting.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.964
Hold my calls.

08:25.798 --> 08:28.134
Now, what's all this
about castles and seats?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.720
<i>Macbeth, Act 1.</i>

08:30.928 --> 08:34.432
But you do have a splendid penthouse,
Artemus.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.183
I can see you enjoy
the pleasures of life.

08:37.393 --> 08:38.686
Mm-hm. Ha-ha-ha.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.938
One hotel is the same as another to me.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.940
I couldn't have put it better myself.

08:43.149 --> 08:47.111
Oh, good. Good.
I like a partner who agrees with me.

08:47.319 --> 08:51.532
Yes, that always makes
for a better partnership.

08:52.867 --> 08:55.327
Now, by two-headed Janus...

08:55.536 --> 08:58.622
...nature hath framed strange fellows
in her time.

08:58.831 --> 09:02.877
Art thou not verily the Caped Crusaders?

09:03.419 --> 09:05.337
You mean Batman and Robin?

09:05.546 --> 09:07.965
I'm sorry we came in unannounced,
Mr. Knab...

09:08.174 --> 09:11.927
...via Batropes up the side of the building.
I'll explain presently.

09:12.136 --> 09:15.264
- Yes, Puzzler, I am Batman.
-And I'm Robin.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.808
We suspected you'd be in town.

09:18.017 --> 09:23.439
And we also had reason to believe he'd be
in this penthouse suite with you, Mr. Knab.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.442
Is that your explanation for interrupting it?

09:28.110 --> 09:30.529
We thought you might be in trouble.

09:30.738 --> 09:36.035
I'm Artemus Knab.
I'm never in trouble. Never.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.205
And he's Puzzler, who knows
every weasel word in the book.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.625
Weasel words, as you put it,
are no concern to me.

09:42.833 --> 09:46.545
Puzzler has come up with a novel idea
out of which I expect to make millions.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.005
More millions.

09:48.214 --> 09:51.592
And if that's trouble, Batman,
I'd like a lot more of it.

09:51.801 --> 09:53.886
You mean more honest millions?

09:54.095 --> 09:56.555
Young man, there's no easier buck
to be made...

09:56.764 --> 09:59.892
...in this world than an honest buck.
-Oh, how true.

10:00.101 --> 10:01.894
I'm sorry, Mr. Knab.

10:02.103 --> 10:06.148
Robin is sometimes inclined
to be a bit impetuous.

10:06.357 --> 10:10.069
Impetuous and curious
about that backward puzzle of yours.

10:10.277 --> 10:16.742
Yes, Puzzler, just what is your novel idea
for increasing Mr. Knab's coffers?

10:16.951 --> 10:19.537
My usual novel method, Batman.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.539
These are highly competitive days.

10:21.747 --> 10:25.960
Anyone with a product to sell
must look for a new and unique approach...

10:26.168 --> 10:28.337
...to publicity and advertising.

10:28.546 --> 10:30.089
- Publicity?
-Advertising?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.549
Yes, for this new venture.

10:31.757 --> 10:36.095
I'm backing Puzzler in the manufacture
of puzzle balloons.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.056
- Something seldom done before.
-Never done before.

10:39.265 --> 10:42.101
Mm. it should make an interesting addition
to my airplane monopoly.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.478
Not to mention my movie-studio monopoly.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.898
My stock-market monopoly,
my ship-building monopoly...

10:48.107 --> 10:50.192
...my various other lesser monopolies.

10:50.401 --> 10:53.988
Care to see a sample of our wares?

10:54.196 --> 10:56.407
Here, Boy Wonder.

10:56.615 --> 11:00.077
You're obviously
not too old to play with balloons.

11:00.286 --> 11:01.912
Maybe not.

11:02.121 --> 11:04.957
But I'm old enough to recognize
a bunco artist when I see one.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.834
Really, Artemus?

11:07.042 --> 11:11.463
How much more am I expected to take
from this caped nincompoop?

11:11.672 --> 11:16.719
Nothing more.
But allow me one last warning, Mr. Knab.

11:16.927 --> 11:21.432
Your new business partner
is not called Puzzler for nothing.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.809
Forgive the intrusion. Let's go, Robin.

11:24.018 --> 11:28.689
Uh, use the front door. It's faster that way.

11:31.859 --> 11:36.363
I just hate to see a reasonably successful
multibillionaire like Artemus Knab...

11:36.572 --> 11:41.827
...taken for a ride by that shady,
pseudo-Shakespearean swindler.

11:42.036 --> 11:46.790
I suspect even Puzzler's met his match
in Artemus Knab.

11:46.999 --> 11:52.129
But let's see what problem
this sample balloon poses, shall we?

11:58.969 --> 12:02.723
"If you knew a hawk from a handsaw...

12:02.932 --> 12:06.435
...would you know a parrot from a plane?"

12:06.644 --> 12:10.981
Maybe he was telling the truth.
Sample balloon, a silly puzzle.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.483
I'm not sure.

12:12.691 --> 12:17.238
"A hawk from a handsaw" is in a line
from Hamlet, Act 2, Scene 2.

12:17.446 --> 12:22.368
"I know a hawk from a handsaw,"
if I remember properly.

12:22.576 --> 12:27.122
But a parrot from a plane, airplane...

12:28.165 --> 12:30.668
Of course.

12:31.043 --> 12:34.046
Puzzler said the balloon might entertain us.

12:34.255 --> 12:37.258
And an airplane and
entertainment mean only one thing.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.759
Holy flight plan.

12:38.968 --> 12:43.013
Artemus Knab's coming-out party
for his new fantastic plane, the Retsoor.

12:43.222 --> 12:48.143
Yes, with some of the créme de la créme
of Gotham City society attending.

12:48.352 --> 12:52.648
And that among other things
spells expensive jewelry.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.234
Puzzles, airplanes, jewelry.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.445
- Let's get to the airport.
-Right, Robin.

13:05.327 --> 13:11.417
<i>NARRATOR". A short time later,
in an airplane hangar at Gotham City Airport...</i>

13:14.169 --> 13:17.673
Ahem. Your attention, please.

13:18.007 --> 13:20.926
Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen...

13:21.135 --> 13:24.888
...friends, folks...

13:25.097 --> 13:28.726
...I hereby christen the Retsoor...

13:28.934 --> 13:31.103
...code name for this experimental model...

13:31.312 --> 13:35.441
...of my X-1000 counter insurgency
reconnaissance jet plane.

13:36.900 --> 13:42.448
<i>NARRATOR". At the same time,
outside the hangar, a strange delivery.</i>

13:48.996 --> 13:52.416
Well, have a good time.

13:52.624 --> 13:58.047
And remember, your donations
are going to a very worthy cause.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.842
Research for my aviation monopoly.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.855
Well...

14:16.398 --> 14:20.736
Zounds, that was a close call.
I thought Artemus Knab would have left.

14:20.944 --> 14:26.950
- Artemus Knab? In that beat-up old jalopy?
-He's a trifle eccentric.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.591
Hey, why didn't you introduce me?

14:42.800 --> 14:45.344
He'll never make me a movie star
if he never meets me.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.347
Harp not on that string, Rocket.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.394
Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.770
Fat and greasy?

14:54.978 --> 14:57.731
A favorite line of mine
from As You <i>Like</i> it, Blimpy.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.651
Translated, it means, "Get going."

15:00.859 --> 15:03.654
This caper calls for split-second timing.

15:04.613 --> 15:10.160
I don't get it. If you plan to steal the airplane,
why waste time with the jewelry?

15:10.369 --> 15:13.288
A little extra pocket money
never came amiss, Blimpy.

15:13.497 --> 15:19.253
My mission is to photograph Retsoor's
controls, yours is to line our pockets.

15:19.461 --> 15:24.258
Let the masquerade commence.
On with the play.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.223
Get your puzzle balloons here.

15:31.432 --> 15:32.808
Don't forget it.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.145
Folks, the kiddies'll love them.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.689
Here you are, folks. Take all you want.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.331
- Sticks.
- Ready.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.631
Pow. Pow.

16:15.559 --> 16:19.771
That invisible puzzle balloon gas
is doing yeoman service.

16:21.857 --> 16:25.694
Bewildering our prey is far better than
knocking them out.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.782
Wow, I just wanna touch all those jewels.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.327
Frailty, thy name is woman.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.706
We must not hesitate.
Our uninvited guests will be here presently.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.840
Ah...

16:47.049 --> 16:51.720
Wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow.

16:53.180 --> 16:57.100
Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.
Rocket, depart by yonder portal.

16:57.309 --> 17:01.730
- We'll see you at the factory.
- Gee, thanks.

17:01.939 --> 17:08.237
All the world's a stage. Now we wait.

17:25.295 --> 17:30.217
Just what I wanted,
to catch you in the act, Puzzler.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.427
My timing is perfect.

17:32.636 --> 17:36.598
Lord, what fools these mortals be.

17:36.807 --> 17:39.977
Puzzle balloons
for the Dynamic Duo, boys.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.441
There's something in the air, Robin.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.945
The game's afoot, curtain going up.

17:50.153 --> 17:55.742
Aye, and the Caped Crusaders muddled
and mazed like all the others.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.369
Do we liquidate them now, boss'?

17:57.578 --> 18:04.334
No, Glider, I have a far more
delicious idea for their demise.

18:06.837 --> 18:10.048
And now to snap a few pictures
of the plane's cockpit...

18:10.257 --> 18:15.012
...and then for some more puzzles.
On with the show.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.891
"What letter is ne'er perceived in the alphabet?"

18:20.100 --> 18:24.438
The letter you put in the mailbox.
But what could that mean?

18:24.646 --> 18:27.941
Maybe the answer is on...

18:28.775 --> 18:32.446
...this piece of paper which was in
that balloon.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.656
Gosh, Batman, it might be.

18:34.865 --> 18:38.910
And also might be the reason Puzzler
or one of his heinous henchmen...

18:39.119 --> 18:44.666
...pinned that balloon on me
while I was momentarily incapacitated.

18:44.875 --> 18:49.504
"Yay, verily, the answer is a fence
in this world's globe."

18:49.713 --> 18:50.881
Uh-huh.

18:51.089 --> 18:55.427
Of course, a fence is someone
who buys stolen jewelry.

18:55.636 --> 19:01.808
Mm. Mm. I don't think Puzzler
would make it that easy for us, old chum.

19:02.017 --> 19:06.647
The hammer spring of a gun lock
is also called a fence.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.441
And they say a horse fence as well
when he leaps a fence.

19:09.650 --> 19:13.236
Maybe that's it, Batman.
Just a plain fence.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.989
Maybe Puzzler wants to make it
easy for us.

19:16.198 --> 19:22.746
Hm. If we follow that line of reasoning,
what constitutes a fence?

19:22.954 --> 19:28.126
- Boards, palings, rail, wire, posts.
-Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.755
Post, like the letter you put in a mailbox.
It's a double clue.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.341
Yeah, but the answer is a fence.

19:34.549 --> 19:39.304
An enclosure, something separating
one yard from another.

19:39.513 --> 19:45.644
- Barnyard, graveyard, shipyard, railroad yard.
-Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm!

19:45.852 --> 19:49.189
Railroad yard. We may be on to it, Robin.

19:49.398 --> 19:55.237
The main post office is located
directly adjacent to the railroad yard.

19:55.445 --> 20:00.075
And somewhere in that facility,
Puzzler plans to sell his stolen jewelry.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.245
I've got it.

20:03.870 --> 20:09.418
The Old Globe Balloon Factory
is also adjacent to the railroad yard.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.878
I should have seen that from the start.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.848
One moment, please.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.810
- Now, may I help you?
-I'd like to see Puzzler, please.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.270
- Your names, please?
-Batman.

20:28.478 --> 20:29.604
And Robin.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.898
- If you're salesmen--
-We're not.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.402
Well, I'm sorry, the Puzzler told me
he's not seeing anyone today.

20:35.610 --> 20:42.033
At the risk of sounding conceited,
young lady, we are not just anyone.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.996
Let's go, Robin.

20:50.792 --> 20:54.421
Just as you thought, Puzzler.
They're on their way in right now.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.007
Man the barricades.

20:58.633 --> 21:03.346
All right, Puzzler,
your insidious little game is, as they say, up.

21:03.555 --> 21:06.349
Not quite, Batman.
I know a trick worth two of that.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.394
Attack.

21:27.788 --> 21:31.958
I'd say this calls for drastic action.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.213
<i>Ow, ow, ow. Hey.</i>

21:37.714 --> 21:40.175
Batman, help.

21:54.356 --> 21:58.902
- What are you gonna do with those?
-The point envenomed too.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.036
- Ouch!
-Batman.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.080
Pow.

22:18.839 --> 22:23.260
Boy, that's really giving them the needle.

22:23.468 --> 22:28.765
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune, Rocket.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.865
There's something in the wind,
Caped Crusaders.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.076
Holy Graf Zeppelin, an aerial balloon.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.453
And here's another little surprise for you.

22:50.662 --> 22:54.875
You see this altimeter?
When you reach 20,000 feet...

22:55.083 --> 22:58.712
...an automatic mechanism will release
the basket from the balloon...

22:58.920 --> 23:04.217
...and you both will re-affirm
Newton's law of universal gravitation...

23:04.426 --> 23:07.304
...back down 20,000 feet.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.765
Bet even Shakespeare didn't have words
for such villainy.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.268
Glider, Blimpy.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.815
- Hey, you guys want some gum?
-Really, Ramjet?

23:19.024 --> 23:21.651
That's what they give you in airlines
before you take off.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.361
No, thank you.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.073
Litter bug.

23:27.282 --> 23:31.745
Now, for the launching,
give me the dagger.

23:33.288 --> 23:37.125
This is the unkindest cut of all.

23:40.795 --> 23:44.007
Farewell, Dynamic Duo.

23:44.215 --> 23:47.552
Bon voyage, happy landings.

23:47.761 --> 23:53.558
Adieu, adieu, remember me.
