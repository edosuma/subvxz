WEBVTT

00:01.992 --> 00:03.626
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>
- It's you.

00:03.628 --> 00:04.961
It's over, Tamara.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.129
- Jake, no.

00:06.131 --> 00:06.896
- I'll see you then.

00:06.898 --> 00:08.097
- That girl's
a straight-up creeper.

00:08.099 --> 00:10.099
- I left because what happened
to you up there

00:10.101 --> 00:12.035
was kind of rough.

00:17.975 --> 00:19.409
- I couldn't figure out
standard deviations

00:19.411 --> 00:21.110
for the life of me,
but there was one formula

00:21.112 --> 00:22.779
I was finally getting
the hang of--

00:22.781 --> 00:24.447
the formula for moving on.

00:24.449 --> 00:26.916
One spectacular senior year
with my friends

00:26.918 --> 00:27.984
plus one amazing new boyfriend

00:27.986 --> 00:31.754
minus absolutely zero
lingering feelings for Matty

00:31.756 --> 00:35.191
equals me ready to start
a new chapter in my life.

00:35.693 --> 00:39.529
- Okay, babe,
break time's over.

00:39.531 --> 00:42.532
Back to the riveting world
of statistics.

00:42.534 --> 00:43.900
So for each number
in the formula,

00:43.902 --> 00:46.069
you subtract the mean
and do what?

00:46.071 --> 00:49.439
- I have no idea.
Want to make out?

00:49.441 --> 00:50.807
- Uh-huh.

00:53.410 --> 00:56.212
- Hey, kids, do you want
some desser--

00:56.214 --> 00:56.979
- Jesus!

00:56.981 --> 00:59.749
Someone needs
a tutorial on knocking.

00:59.751 --> 01:00.550
- I am so sorry, Sweetie.

01:00.552 --> 01:01.684
I'm just gonna be
a bad parent

01:01.686 --> 01:03.219
and pretend I didn't see
any of this.

01:03.221 --> 01:04.954
Just promise me
you'll be careful,

01:04.956 --> 01:06.489
because if you've learned
one thing

01:06.491 --> 01:07.156
from your father and me,

01:07.158 --> 01:08.658
it's that it only takes
one thrust

01:08.660 --> 01:11.461
for someone to become
a teen mom.

01:12.730 --> 01:15.031
- That is so embarrassing.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.132
- [clears throat]

01:16.134 --> 01:17.934
- Now, where were we?

01:17.936 --> 01:18.935
- Uh, it's getting pretty late.

01:18.937 --> 01:21.671
Should we just pick this up
next time?

01:21.673 --> 01:22.672
- Good idea.

01:22.674 --> 01:23.873
No more distractions.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.442
- It's been a pleasure
being your math tutor.

01:26.444 --> 01:29.512
I accept payment in the form
of Visa, Mastercard,

01:29.514 --> 01:32.081
or, in your case,
a really excellent kiss.

01:32.083 --> 01:35.551
- My formula for moving on
seemed to be working out great.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.452
When I kissed Luke,

01:36.454 --> 01:39.222
all I saw was my present
and my future...

01:39.224 --> 01:41.390
And Matty?

01:41.392 --> 01:44.727
On second thought, maybe
I needed to get my eyes checked.

01:44.729 --> 01:48.798
[keys clacking, loud thud]

01:48.800 --> 01:50.333
- Hey.

01:50.335 --> 01:52.401
Sorry to interrupt.
- Matty, right?

01:52.403 --> 01:54.003
Great to meet you.
I'm Luke.

01:54.005 --> 01:55.505
- Yeah, I know.
Hey.

01:55.507 --> 01:56.739
- Matty, what are you
doing here?

01:56.741 --> 02:00.476
I thought you'd be on lockdown
after the Mr. PHHS pageant.

02:00.478 --> 02:01.778
- Yeah, I'm grounded for life,

02:01.780 --> 02:02.945
but what are they gonna do,

02:02.947 --> 02:04.380
add another day
for sneaking out?

02:04.382 --> 02:07.016
Anyway, I'm here on business.

02:07.018 --> 02:09.519
- Oh, the BF/GF/BFF concert.

02:09.521 --> 02:12.588
- BF/GF/BFF is the name
of a band?

02:12.590 --> 02:14.891
- No, it's not.
It's a--

02:14.893 --> 02:15.458
never mind.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.194
I'm sorry.
I forgot about this.

02:18.196 --> 02:18.628
- Same.

02:18.630 --> 02:20.863
No clue what Jake and Tamara
are doing with theirs,

02:20.865 --> 02:23.199
but I figured
you could have mine and--

02:23.201 --> 02:25.468
I don't know--
take Luke if you want.

02:25.470 --> 02:29.205
- Thanks, man, but I have
midterms this weekend.

02:29.207 --> 02:31.707
Why don't you guys
just go together?

02:31.709 --> 02:33.643
- Seriously?
You wouldn't mind?

02:33.645 --> 02:34.243
- Not at all.

02:34.245 --> 02:36.712
You shouldn't miss a show
you already paid for.

02:36.714 --> 02:39.081
- I am down if you are.

02:39.983 --> 02:40.716
- Sure.
Why not?

02:40.718 --> 02:44.020
It was great being with
a secure, mature college guy.

02:44.022 --> 02:45.521
Only some high school spaz
would make

02:45.523 --> 02:48.357
a big deal out of a couple
of stupid concert tickets.

02:48.359 --> 02:51.727
- These concert tickets
are a big freakin' deal, Rosati!

02:51.729 --> 02:53.329
You don't even deserve
to look at them!

02:53.331 --> 02:54.697
- Oh, okay,
I can't look at them.

02:54.699 --> 02:55.631
- No, you can't look at them.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.134
- Ugh.
- This footage is fantastic.

02:58.136 --> 02:58.968
- Why are you guys filming this?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.469
- We're making
a documentary called

03:00.471 --> 03:02.038
<i>Straight People Are Basic.</i>

03:02.040 --> 03:03.840
You'd be so great in it!

03:03.842 --> 03:05.074
- Oh, no, no.

03:05.076 --> 03:06.209
Good luck with that.

03:06.211 --> 03:07.810
- Would anyone be interested

03:07.812 --> 03:10.713
in either Jake
or Tamara's ticket to Echosmith?

03:10.715 --> 03:12.682
There's no way
they're both going.

03:12.684 --> 03:15.651
- Oh, pick me.
Pick me, please.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.253
Oh, please, Hamiltacky.

03:17.255 --> 03:19.889
Even if Austin and I
didn't already have tickets,

03:19.891 --> 03:21.390
I'd never be desperado enough

03:21.392 --> 03:23.459
to take your friends'
sloppy seconds.

03:23.461 --> 03:26.529
- I believed you when you said
you had three pet dingoes

03:26.531 --> 03:28.297
and a vacation home
in the outback!

03:28.299 --> 03:30.132
Do you know how humiliating
that is?

03:30.134 --> 03:32.869
- OMG, did you hear that?
- Hear what?

03:32.871 --> 03:36.606
- That's the sound of me
not giving a flying [bleep].

03:36.608 --> 03:37.139
All: Oh.

03:37.141 --> 03:39.342
- Thank God we were never
that bad.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.344
I'm sorry you had
to see Luke and I

03:41.346 --> 03:42.144
mid-make-out last night.

03:42.146 --> 03:44.313
- Well, Jenna, it's not like
it was the first time.

03:44.315 --> 03:46.883
- Ouch.
Totally true, but ouch.

03:46.885 --> 03:49.418
- Luke seems like
a good guy, though.

03:49.420 --> 03:52.054
I'm really happy for you.

03:52.056 --> 03:53.055
[sighs]

03:53.057 --> 03:56.826
It is hard to find a person
of quality around here.

03:56.828 --> 03:57.393
Trust me.

03:57.395 --> 03:58.828
- You know, maybe
I'll write another song

03:58.830 --> 04:02.765
and call it <i>My Crazy Ex Talks</i>
<i>Like a Speed Freak</i>

04:02.767 --> 04:03.532
<i>No JK, LOL.</i>

04:03.534 --> 04:08.504
- How are you gonna do that
without your precious harmonica?

04:12.309 --> 04:13.376
All: Oh!

04:13.378 --> 04:14.677
- Aw.

04:14.912 --> 04:17.480
I didn't do anything wrong,
except date a psychopath

04:17.482 --> 04:19.215
who can do a convincing
Australian accent.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.084
- When you speak,
I want to die, just FYI.

04:22.086 --> 04:24.787
- Stop it! Stop it!
You've both been acting crazy.

04:24.789 --> 04:26.689
It is time that you learn
a thing or two

04:26.691 --> 04:30.626
from your friends/model exes
Jenna and Matty.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.161
These two have managed

04:32.163 --> 04:34.230
to maintain the peace
even after Jenna

04:34.232 --> 04:35.665
cruelly cheated on him

04:35.667 --> 04:37.867
and fell down
a rabbit hole of sin.

04:37.869 --> 04:40.169
Smash-cut to the brutal irony
of this year--

04:40.171 --> 04:42.405
Jenna is now dating
a hot college stud,

04:42.407 --> 04:44.640
and Matty
is still single and alone.

04:44.642 --> 04:46.142
- I'm--I'm fine, actually.

04:46.144 --> 04:47.176
- Shh.
Don't speak.

04:47.178 --> 04:48.110
What I'm trying to say

04:48.112 --> 04:50.313
is that these two
have a million reasons

04:50.315 --> 04:51.948
why they should be
putting up their Dukes

04:51.950 --> 04:54.283
in the quad,
but they are choosing

04:54.285 --> 04:55.017
to be mature.

04:55.019 --> 04:56.152
- Fine.
You want maturity?

04:56.154 --> 04:58.888
I'm giving up my ticket.
Have fun at the concert.

04:58.890 --> 05:01.424
- Yay!
That means I win.

05:01.892 --> 05:02.858
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!

05:02.860 --> 05:05.061
Do you guys, uh, know anyone

05:05.063 --> 05:06.228
who might want Jake's ticket?

05:06.230 --> 05:09.465
'Cause I think I know a girl
who could really use

05:09.467 --> 05:12.802
a night of love, laughter,
and music.

05:14.104 --> 05:15.805
Talking about me.

05:15.807 --> 05:16.339
- Val was right.

05:16.341 --> 05:18.841
It wasn't fair that I was in
a solid relationship with Luke

05:18.843 --> 05:20.276
while Matty
was getting hit on by girls

05:20.278 --> 05:22.712
who didn't even know
how to spell "monogamy."

05:22.714 --> 05:24.146
He deserved better.

05:24.148 --> 05:25.214
- Now that my ex
has exed himself

05:25.216 --> 05:27.483
out of our plans,
who should we invite?

05:27.485 --> 05:28.684
- I'm cool with whoever.

05:28.686 --> 05:31.253
I'll see you guys later.

05:31.255 --> 05:32.655
- This is gonna sound weird,

05:32.657 --> 05:35.791
but I kind of wish Matty had
a girl to bring to the concert.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.560
- Hold the iPhone.
What are you talking about?

05:37.562 --> 05:40.563
- Seeing Matty move on
like I have would make me happy.

05:40.565 --> 05:41.397
- I call bluffnanigans, Jenna.

05:41.399 --> 05:43.632
No one wants to see their ex
date other people.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.335
- I do. I want Matty to date.
- Really?

05:46.337 --> 05:47.269
Well, if you're so sure,

05:47.271 --> 05:48.738
why don't you set him up
yourself?

05:48.740 --> 05:51.841
- Maybe I will.
Got any suggestions?

05:52.309 --> 05:55.978
- As a matter of fact,
I do.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.379
Eva.

05:56.381 --> 05:58.814
She's so down-to-earth
and nonthreatening.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.815
What do you think?

05:59.817 --> 06:00.449
- Setting up Matty

06:00.451 --> 06:02.118
with one of the hottest girls
in school

06:02.120 --> 06:03.986
wouldn't be my first choice...

06:03.988 --> 06:05.421
Or second or 90th.

06:05.423 --> 06:06.889
- See?
I told you, Jenna.

06:06.891 --> 06:09.492
Put a TBD
on your NBD attitude.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.260
- You know what?
You're wrong.

06:11.262 --> 06:11.927
Hey, Eva.

06:11.929 --> 06:14.430
- Mother "F,"
I wasn't serious.

06:14.432 --> 06:16.966
- Hey, girls.
You both look super chic today.

06:16.968 --> 06:18.501
What's up?
- I was wondering.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.871
How do you feel
about live music?

06:25.809 --> 06:27.943
- Wow!
What a cool car, Tamara.

06:27.945 --> 06:30.846
Just remind me to put
a paper bag over my head

06:30.848 --> 06:32.381
when we roll up
to the venue, okay?

06:32.383 --> 06:34.583
- Press pause
on the ungrate hate, Sadie.

06:34.585 --> 06:37.253
Would you rather be driving
your wienermobile

06:37.255 --> 06:38.421
to the concert?

06:38.423 --> 06:41.190
- You're showing visible signs
of discomfort.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.259
Back massage commences now.

06:43.261 --> 06:45.461
- Now that I had accepted
Tamara's challenge

06:45.463 --> 06:46.662
and gotten Matty and Eva
together,

06:46.664 --> 06:49.598
it was time for me to do
a little massaging of my own.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.233
I love your dress, Eva.
- Oh, thanks.

06:51.235 --> 06:54.603
It was a gift from
an old friend--Alexander Wang.

06:54.605 --> 06:56.138
- Ugh.
- Too strong?

06:56.140 --> 06:58.307
- Too desperate.

07:02.913 --> 07:06.415
- You know, you two
look really good together.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.084
- Oh, you think?

07:08.086 --> 07:09.919
- Excuse me. Oh, sorry.

07:09.921 --> 07:12.521
Hey, uh, what are you doing?

07:12.523 --> 07:14.690
- I just want you to have
a good time tonight--

07:14.692 --> 07:15.424
no hidden agenda.

07:15.426 --> 07:18.794
- Okay, well,
you're being weird, but okay.

07:18.796 --> 07:20.029
- Playing matchmaker
with an ex

07:20.031 --> 07:23.499
proves you've gone
from point "A" to point cray.

07:23.501 --> 07:24.100
- I'm not crazy.

07:24.102 --> 07:26.502
Maybe once you finally get over
Jake, you'll understand.

07:26.504 --> 07:28.604
- Please.
I'm so over Jake.

07:28.606 --> 07:29.805
- Can we go?

07:29.807 --> 07:32.842
- ♪ We walk like
there's nothing wrong ♪

07:32.844 --> 07:41.083
♪

07:41.085 --> 07:42.384
- Rude. Give it back.

07:42.386 --> 07:44.386
- Can you not look at your phone
while driving?

07:44.388 --> 07:45.988
You are way too obsessed
with Jake.

07:45.990 --> 07:46.689
It's not healthy.

07:46.691 --> 07:48.824
- Please tell me
someone here has alcohol.

07:48.826 --> 07:51.093
If I have to share
this gross oxygen pool

07:51.095 --> 07:53.095
with you losers,
the least you could do

07:53.097 --> 07:55.331
is get me drunk
so I don't remember it.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.165
- I left my flask at home,

07:56.167 --> 07:58.501
but we can get drinks
with our fakes at the show.

07:58.503 --> 07:59.802
- No one here has a fake.

07:59.804 --> 08:03.072
- [clears throat]
I do.

08:03.607 --> 08:06.709
- Matty, this won't even get you
into an R-rated movie.

08:06.711 --> 08:09.145
It's okay; We can stop
by this place downtown.

08:09.147 --> 08:09.979
They do fakes on the quick.

08:09.981 --> 08:12.615
I got my first I.D. There
when I was, like, 15.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.917
- You told us you were
at boarding school

08:14.919 --> 08:17.319
in Switzerland
when you were 15.

08:17.321 --> 08:20.055

Should I have given you
my blessing

17:52.463 --> 17:54.062
when you cheated on me
with Colin last year

17:54.064 --> 17:56.531
or maybe when you started
to date Luke?

17:56.533 --> 17:59.701
We don't need
each other's blessings, Jenna.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.737
We're not together.

18:02.538 --> 18:04.639
Hey, let's go.

18:04.641 --> 18:06.541
Eva, you gonna come with?

18:08.111 --> 18:10.612
- [mouths words]

18:12.048 --> 18:14.416
- Jenna,
we're gone, baby, gone.

18:14.418 --> 18:16.251
Come on.

18:17.386 --> 18:20.522
- Hey!
Get out of my car, man!

18:20.524 --> 18:22.190
Jesus!

18:22.192 --> 18:23.558
You too!

18:31.167 --> 18:33.568
- Close call, boys.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.102
- Bummer.

18:34.104 --> 18:35.704
We didn't even get
to see Echosmith play.

18:35.706 --> 18:37.806
- At least we got
some fake I.Ds out of it.

18:37.808 --> 18:39.541
- Oh, you guys got fakes?
Let me see.

18:39.543 --> 18:42.778
- I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

18:45.114 --> 18:46.314
"John Smith"?

18:46.316 --> 18:47.415
Jake, this is so lame.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.152
- Oh, whatever, William, Kate.
- Whatever.

18:50.154 --> 18:52.220
It's cute. We're cute.
- Yeah.

18:52.222 --> 18:53.789
- What do you say
we call Jake a car

18:53.791 --> 18:55.624
and then you and I
can get out of here?

18:55.626 --> 18:58.393
- I love that idea.
- Great.

18:58.395 --> 18:59.661
Jake, we're calling you
an uber.

18:59.663 --> 19:00.495
You're too drunk to drive.

19:00.497 --> 19:05.200
- You don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

19:05.202 --> 19:07.369
Ugh, it smells like tweakers
in here.

19:07.371 --> 19:09.237
One sec.
- Yeah.

19:13.176 --> 19:15.811
- I thought Eva was too good
for high school guys.

19:15.813 --> 19:19.347
- Looks like she made
an exception there, Jakey.

19:19.349 --> 19:20.448
[siren wails]

19:20.450 --> 19:23.385
- [bleep],
hide the booze, man.

19:23.387 --> 19:27.789
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

19:27.791 --> 19:29.024
- You two been drinking tonight?

19:29.026 --> 19:31.927
- Well, yes, sir, we have,
but our friend

19:31.929 --> 19:33.161
went to go call us a car, so...

19:33.163 --> 19:34.830
- Yeah, we didn't start
drinking

19:34.832 --> 19:35.764
until we got to the concert,

19:35.766 --> 19:37.532
which we didn't even
end up seeing.

19:37.534 --> 19:40.001
- Hey, I'm not asking
for your life story here.

19:40.003 --> 19:40.669
- That's great,

19:40.671 --> 19:43.271
because I don't have
a life story to tell you.

19:43.273 --> 19:44.840
- Show me your I.Ds.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.648
You little candy-asses
getting a thrill

19:53.650 --> 19:54.749
by being in this part of town?

19:54.751 --> 19:56.484
- Yeah, you don't know
anything about us,

19:56.486 --> 19:58.720
so why are you being
such a dick?

19:58.722 --> 20:00.255
- Shut up, dude.

20:00.257 --> 20:02.457
- That's it.
Out of the car right now.

20:02.459 --> 20:04.292
Right now. Come on.
- We didn't do anything wrong.

20:04.294 --> 20:05.994
- Those open containers
just jump in your car

20:05.996 --> 20:07.095
when you weren't looking?

20:07.097 --> 20:08.196
- How'd you guess, huh?

20:08.198 --> 20:10.298
- Get!
- Matty!

20:11.767 --> 20:13.902
[cell phone chimes]

20:18.641 --> 20:20.575
- Sometimes it felt like
I was stuck

20:20.577 --> 20:21.610
in an emotional prison

20:21.612 --> 20:23.912
waiting to be set free
from my feelings for Matty,

20:23.914 --> 20:27.949
and now that I had Luke,
the handcuffs were coming off.

20:27.951 --> 20:29.251
- Gets even better.

20:29.253 --> 20:30.318
Precinct lockup
is all full.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.555
You boys get to spend
the night in County.

20:33.557 --> 20:35.223
- [sighs]

20:37.326 --> 20:38.126
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>

20:38.128 --> 20:39.594
We can still make it
to SCU by midnight

20:39.596 --> 20:40.762
and spend our night
with real men.

20:40.764 --> 20:42.097
- Every one of them
is like a living,

20:42.099 --> 20:44.266
breathing J. Crew catalog,
only hotter.

20:44.268 --> 20:46.468
Hey there.
- [belches]

20:46.470 --> 20:48.270
- Surprise!

20:48.272 --> 20:49.204
- Don't we get one phone call?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.106
- I'd rather die in prison
than call Jenna right now.

20:51.108 --> 20:52.207
- Gonna give you
his brother's number.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.009
He'll know exactly
how to handle this situation.

20:54.011 --> 20:56.544
- I went to Jenna.
She said she couldn't help.
