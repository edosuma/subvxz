Exactly.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.997
Because accountability
is overrated.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.173
No, because you don't
need to protect me.

to begin with.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.089
You're right.

about responsibility

makes more sense than someone

I was about to arrest him.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.495
I know!

03:54.538 --> 03:56.497
And I am so over Him
getting in my head,

03:56.540 --> 03:58.281

29:05.004 --> 29:06.440
DAN: Poisonous pudding?
Are you kidding me?

29:06.483 --> 29:08.355
So, Simon must have gotten sick

29:08.398 --> 29:09.835
from his constant
exposure to it?

29:09.878 --> 29:11.924
Well, what kind of idiot would
intentionally put poison

29:11.967 --> 29:13.926
in their own product?These two chemicals
have been known

29:13.969 --> 29:17.146
to fake the appearance
of a higher protein content.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.583
Which is Pudding Plus'
biggest selling point.But wouldn't people

29:19.627 --> 29:21.411
eventually realize
that it's poisonous?

29:21.455 --> 29:23.544
I mean, the company
would lose everything.Not necessarily.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.328
If you have hundreds
of millions of dollars,

29:25.372 --> 29:27.417
and you get sued
for a couple of million,

29:27.461 --> 29:29.289
you still have hundreds
of millions of dollars.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.726
But people die.Yeah, well,

29:31.770 --> 29:33.815
it's the same calculation
the car manufacturers make

29:33.859 --> 29:36.165
when they find out
they have faulty airbags.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.907
Which costs them less,
recalling the car

29:38.951 --> 29:40.953
or enduring the lawsuits?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.432
ELLA: Yeah,
but why would Simon

29:42.476 --> 29:45.261
try to sell the formula to Grace
if it was killing him?

29:45.305 --> 29:46.393
Unless he didn't.

29:46.436 --> 29:47.786
Maybe when he found out
what he created,

29:47.829 --> 29:49.048
he was just trying to stop it.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.310
LUCIFER:
And who better to expose

29:50.353 --> 29:51.398
Pudding Plus' dirty secret

29:51.441 --> 29:52.921
than their biggest
competitor?

29:52.965 --> 29:54.183
But Simon
didn't know.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.445
the two companies weremerging.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.273
Soon they won't be
in competition.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.927
DAN: Suddenly,
everyone has motive

29:58.971 --> 30:00.102
to keep Simon quiet.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.712
Adrian, Grace andthe fixer.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.410
Three potential killers.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.716
And as the merged
company's counsel...

30:05.760 --> 30:07.675
you represent all of them.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.376
Charlotte,
where are you going?

30:13.420 --> 30:15.639
To join the Peace Corps
or donate my entire savings

30:15.683 --> 30:18.817
to an orphanage or build
a shelter for blind,
one-legged puppies.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.862
Well, as long as you're
not being overdramatic.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.386
I thought delivering those tapes
would help clearmy ledger.

30:23.430 --> 30:26.041
But instead, it just revealed
that I've been defending

30:26.085 --> 30:27.390
threeguilty people?

30:27.434 --> 30:28.827
Uh...
If that's true,

30:28.870 --> 30:30.524
how guilty does that make me?

30:34.136 --> 30:35.834
[exhales]

30:37.966 --> 30:40.055
This isn't a good time.

30:40.099 --> 30:41.883
I know how you've
been treating Dan.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.320
Okay? And I want you to know
that I got his back.

30:44.364 --> 30:46.670
What's that mean?I used to see

30:46.714 --> 30:48.803
a light in you.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.675
But now, I don't know,
something's different.

30:51.719 --> 30:54.113
All I see now...

30:54.156 --> 30:56.115
is darkness.

31:02.164 --> 31:05.211
Oh, there you are.
Where'd you run off to?

31:05.254 --> 31:07.517
Just needed to
clear my head.

31:07.561 --> 31:10.259
Do you think Charlotte
will be all right?Yeah.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.392
Why wouldn't she be?
That woman's like a rock.

31:12.435 --> 31:15.351
Like a very mean, scary, hot,

31:15.395 --> 31:16.918
well-dressed rock.

31:16.962 --> 31:20.704
Yes, well...
you'd be surprised, Detective.

31:20.748 --> 31:21.923
Okay.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.186
Well, now that we know
all three suspects

31:24.230 --> 31:26.145
have the same motive-- money--

31:26.188 --> 31:28.408
I looked into
the company's financials

31:28.451 --> 31:31.237
to see who had the most to lose
if the merger failed.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.196
And get this--
it's none of our three.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.155
You really think I killed Simon?

31:36.198 --> 31:38.026
Lalo, we know you stood
to gain hundreds

31:38.070 --> 31:40.376
of thousands of dollars
in vested stock options

31:40.420 --> 31:43.902
once those two pudding
companies merged.That's a lot of money.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.207
For you. Obviously.

31:45.251 --> 31:47.383
But, uh, it all
would have disappeared

31:47.427 --> 31:50.169
had Simon revealed the truth
behind his illness.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.040
You... you mean Simon
really was sick?

31:52.084 --> 31:53.259
You knew about that?

31:53.302 --> 31:55.522
Sure. He said
he was gonna die.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.567
But I didn't take it seriously.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.179
He said a lot
of things that night.What night?

32:00.222 --> 32:02.181
About a month ago,
we went out drinking.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.704
Simon got wasted.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.185
He started going off
about how Mr. Yates

32:06.228 --> 32:07.534
wasn't listening to him,

32:07.577 --> 32:09.710
and that people were
gonna suffer for it.

32:09.753 --> 32:13.322
He said something about
how it was his own fault.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.020
Simon said that...

32:15.063 --> 32:17.805
maybe he should just end it.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.198
End what?

32:19.241 --> 32:20.547
His life.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.201
Huh.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.594
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.596
And you didn't think
to tell us this sooner?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.598
Like when he
showed up dead?

32:28.642 --> 32:32.080
A bunch of drunken nonsense?

32:32.124 --> 32:34.213
It's not like he jumped

32:34.256 --> 32:35.779
into that vat.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.825
I mean...

32:37.868 --> 32:40.349
boiling pudding?

32:40.393 --> 32:43.004
There's easier ways to go.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.050
But none so revealing.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.486
What?

32:46.529 --> 32:48.096
What if this was
Simon's Hail Mary?

32:48.140 --> 32:51.578
A way to expose the truth
that he felt so guilty about.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.145
Oh, so you think
the man actually killed himself

32:53.188 --> 32:54.929
to lead us to the toxin?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.539
Well, if he did, it worked.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.630
The suicide version's
looking more and more likely.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.155
Day before his death,
Simon changed his will.

33:03.198 --> 33:04.460
He donated

33:04.504 --> 33:06.506
all his possessions to charity.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.987
He even gave away
his pet turtle.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.640
Huh.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.860
And the scuff marks
on the platform...

33:12.903 --> 33:16.516
He must have faked a struggle
to make it look like a homicide.

33:16.559 --> 33:20.563
To keep us
investigating the companies.Huh.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.000
WOMAN: Hello,
Charlotte Richards' office.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.479
Charlotte, good news.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.959
It was a suicide.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.656
So no need to worry.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.397
You won't be representing
any murderers.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.269
Charlotte just left.

33:30.312 --> 33:33.533
She went to meet some clients.

33:33.576 --> 33:34.882
Why do I get the feeling

33:34.925 --> 33:37.711
Charlotte's about
to do something very stupid?

33:44.109 --> 33:46.024
So, what's this about?
Why the last-minute meeting?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.155
Yeah, and why here?

33:47.199 --> 33:48.896
Didn't we agree
to delay merger talk

33:48.939 --> 33:52.247
until after the LAPD ends
their investigation?

33:52.291 --> 33:55.294
We did. This meeting
is about other business.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.296
Personal business.

33:57.339 --> 33:58.775
What the hell does that mean?

33:58.819 --> 34:00.560
No one's leaving here
until I figure out

34:00.603 --> 34:03.563
which one of you
murdered Simon Fisher.

34:04.651 --> 34:05.652
Um...

34:10.483 --> 34:13.094
So, a funny thing happened

34:13.138 --> 34:14.922
a couple of months ago.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.620
I sort of died.

34:17.664 --> 34:21.407
And apparently
there's a chance I went to Hell.

34:21.450 --> 34:22.669
Oh, I know. I was...

34:22.712 --> 34:24.714
I was as shocked as you are.

34:24.758 --> 34:28.370
I'm feeling much better now.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.721
Thanks for asking.

34:31.765 --> 34:35.203
[chuckles]:
Though there might be

34:35.247 --> 34:38.076
a slight chance

34:38.119 --> 34:40.687
that I'm having
a nervous breakdown

34:40.730 --> 34:42.471
as we speak.

34:42.515 --> 34:43.603
Anyhow...

34:43.646 --> 34:45.387
I've had some time to think,

34:45.431 --> 34:49.261
and I'm pretty sure that my sin

34:49.304 --> 34:51.089
was a lifetime of defending

34:51.132 --> 34:53.439
known criminals and murderers.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.223
Apparently
nobody bothered to tell me

34:55.267 --> 34:56.964
that all the blood
that they shed

34:57.007 --> 34:58.922
is on my hands, too.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.228
[chuckles nervously]

35:00.272 --> 35:03.275
Now, here I am

35:03.318 --> 35:05.277
with a second chance,

35:05.320 --> 35:07.496
and one of you...

35:07.540 --> 35:11.457
is screwing it up.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.024
So, speak.

35:16.244 --> 35:18.420
Which one of you killed Simon?

35:18.464 --> 35:20.857
Charlotte, none of us did it.He's right.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.512
No, I know that Simon
was about to blow the whistle

35:23.556 --> 35:25.123
on your little secret.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.515
So one of you

35:26.559 --> 35:28.126
must have done it.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.348
FIXER:
Why are we still sitting here?

35:33.392 --> 35:35.263
I'm done
listening to this crazy bitch.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.004
Sit down!

35:37.047 --> 35:38.136
Why don't you make me?

35:39.049 --> 35:41.704
That can't be good.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.882
What the hell? You
could have shot me.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.710
Very easily.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.016
Now sit.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.627
Look, lady, all I did
was intimidate Simon.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.107
And I stopped as soon as Adrian

35:53.151 --> 35:55.544
called me off. I was just
doing what he paid me to do.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.198
W-We didn't need to kill Simon.

35:57.242 --> 36:00.027
We kept him quiet.A-And just sped up the merger.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.377
We were all set to
make record profits

36:02.421 --> 36:04.901
despite Simon's
nitpicky safety concerns.

36:04.945 --> 36:07.991
Yeah. Why would we go kill him
after all of that?

36:08.035 --> 36:09.254
Well, I don't know.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.429
Loose ends, maybe?

36:10.472 --> 36:13.258
I'm gonna make this right
one way

36:13.301 --> 36:15.521
or another.Charlotte.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.653
Wait.

36:17.697 --> 36:20.003
Lucifer?They're telling the truth.

36:20.047 --> 36:23.050
None of these scoundrels
killed Simon.

36:23.093 --> 36:24.486
He killed himself.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.401
A dying man's plan
to expose the company

36:26.445 --> 36:27.924
and its crimes.

36:27.968 --> 36:31.014
[scoffs]
That doesn't make any sense.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.712
Charlotte...

36:32.755 --> 36:34.888
they're innocent.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.461
No.

36:42.504 --> 36:43.723
No, they're not.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.812
Did you not hear
what I just said?

36:45.855 --> 36:49.032
Oh, I heard.
So they didn't kill Simon.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.731
What about everybody
who eats their stupid pudding?

36:51.774 --> 36:54.777
They all knew
their product was poisonous.

36:54.821 --> 36:58.607
Innocent people are gonna die
because of them.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.435
I've lived my life

37:00.479 --> 37:02.220
finding loopholes,

37:02.263 --> 37:04.744
ways of evading responsibility
for my clients.

37:06.093 --> 37:08.400
Myself.

37:08.443 --> 37:11.054
Turns out...

37:11.098 --> 37:14.449
there are no loopholes.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.538
If you're guilty,

37:16.582 --> 37:19.280
you're guilty.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.673
I understand that you want

37:20.716 --> 37:22.240
to clear the red
from your ledger.

37:22.283 --> 37:25.852
But believe me, Charlotte,
this is not the way to do it.

37:25.895 --> 37:28.376
Then what am I supposed to do?

37:28.420 --> 37:30.335
I can't go...

37:30.378 --> 37:33.251
I can't go back there.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.904
Can't.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.082
Then here's what you need to do,
Charlotte.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.868
Trust me.

37:50.703 --> 37:53.619
Thank you.

37:53.662 --> 37:56.317
What about them?

37:56.361 --> 37:57.797
Well...

37:57.840 --> 37:59.668
whilst I was lurking
in the shadows,

37:59.712 --> 38:02.018
they said quite a few
incriminating things.

38:02.062 --> 38:05.761
Detective, was that enough
for a proper perp walk of shame?

38:05.805 --> 38:08.286
CHLOE:
Yep, plenty.

38:10.853 --> 38:14.117
FBI's gonna have a field day
with these recorded confessions.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.119
You may not have pushed Simon
to his death,

38:16.163 --> 38:18.208
but you'll pay for your role
in poisoning him.

38:22.169 --> 38:24.345
Nice win, partner.Thank you very much.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.695
I'm just surprised you let me
enter the factory first.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.480
Oh, I figured it was your turn
to get shot at.

38:28.523 --> 38:31.439
Oh. [chuckles]You know, you were
right about Charlotte.

38:31.483 --> 38:33.441
There's more to her
than I thought.

38:33.485 --> 38:36.096
The things she said...Sounded loony?

38:36.139 --> 38:39.273
No. Sounded like
somebody wrestling

38:39.317 --> 38:40.579
with their demons.

38:45.410 --> 38:48.630
I couldn't help but overhear
what you said back there.

38:48.674 --> 38:50.806
Sounds like you're...

38:50.850 --> 38:53.331
going through a lot.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.071
I'm sorry you're struggling.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.246
You're right.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.945
[chuckles]:
I am going through a lot.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.818
But that's no excuse
for how I've treated you.

39:02.862 --> 39:05.604
Well, I appreciate that.

39:05.647 --> 39:09.782
Maybe we could meet
for coffee sometime.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.785
Maybe.

39:14.656 --> 39:16.397
Hope I'm not interrupting
anything, Daniel.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.878
Charlotte, ready
for that ride home?

39:18.921 --> 39:20.880
[sighs]

39:25.928 --> 39:30.019
CHLOE:
Trixie, can you come out here?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.891
Hi, Mommy.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.764
Monkey, I want to talk to you

39:35.808 --> 39:37.375
about what happened today
at school.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.202
Did you tell Miss Morgan

39:39.246 --> 39:41.683
to "go to shell"?

39:41.727 --> 39:44.643
I didn't technically
break any rules.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.253
[sighs]

39:50.779 --> 39:52.346
You know what?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.782
Lucifer was right.

39:53.826 --> 39:56.350
The swear jar, it's...
it's a dumb idea.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.700
Mommy gave you a bunch of rules

39:58.744 --> 40:01.137
without explaining things.

40:01.181 --> 40:03.575
The real reason

40:03.618 --> 40:04.880
that we shouldn't swear

40:04.924 --> 40:08.057
is that bad words
make people feel bad.

40:08.101 --> 40:12.235
And I know you don't want
to make people feel bad, right?

40:12.279 --> 40:14.412
'Cause the truth is
if you go looking for loopholes,

40:14.455 --> 40:16.196
you'll always find them.

40:16.239 --> 40:19.460
And I can't force you
to do the right thing.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.376
You'll just have to
learn that on your own.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.771
So no more swear jar. Okay?

40:25.814 --> 40:29.557
So does that mean
I get my money back?

40:29.601 --> 40:31.167
Nice try.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.914
Would you like to come in?

40:38.958 --> 40:40.786
You're not gonna pounce
on me again, are you?

40:40.829 --> 40:43.266
Because that was
a smashing success last time.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.920
Come in, scaredy-cat.

40:44.964 --> 40:48.576
After today, I need wine stat.

40:48.620 --> 40:49.969
This whole "being good" thing?

40:50.012 --> 40:52.145
Tougher than I thought.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.799
It's a nice place you've got.

40:53.842 --> 40:57.280
Though, uh, could stand
to nest a bit more.

40:57.324 --> 41:01.284
I don't even remember
getting this place.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.722
I hope you like red.

41:03.765 --> 41:06.681
I'm a rosé girl, myself.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.727
Apparently while I was away,

41:08.770 --> 41:11.120
I bought 30 cases of Merlot.

41:11.164 --> 41:12.948
[chuckles] Yes.
Sorry about that.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.167
Why would you be sorry?

41:14.210 --> 41:16.212
You're not responsible
for my lost time.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.779
No.

41:17.823 --> 41:19.868
Yet I can't help but feel...

41:21.217 --> 41:22.610
[chuckles]

41:22.654 --> 41:24.830
...somewhat accountable.

41:24.873 --> 41:27.963
Is that why you're here?

41:28.007 --> 41:29.617
Well, this strange,
inexplicable compulsion

41:29.661 --> 41:31.358
to make sure you're okay?

41:31.401 --> 41:32.881
Very possibly.

41:32.925 --> 41:35.449
Dad be damned.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.541
You spent time with me when I...

41:40.585 --> 41:43.370
wasn't me.

41:45.372 --> 41:47.505
What was I like?

41:49.550 --> 41:51.944
Well, you were...

41:51.987 --> 41:54.773
quite the handful, actually.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.644
Intense.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.124
Jealous.

41:58.167 --> 41:59.995
Hair-trigger emotions.

42:00.039 --> 42:03.521
Prone to making
cosmically epic mistakes.

42:03.564 --> 42:05.914
[chuckles]

42:05.958 --> 42:08.569
But everything that you did--

42:08.613 --> 42:12.007
the other you did, I...

42:12.051 --> 42:15.228
I know that it came
from a place...

42:17.796 --> 42:19.537
...of love.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.930
♪ Ooh, are you happy

42:21.974 --> 42:25.630
I will miss her.

42:25.673 --> 42:28.023
More than she'll ever know.

42:28.067 --> 42:30.548
♪ I guess I'll be one of a lot

42:30.591 --> 42:33.202
But that isn't you, is it?

42:33.246 --> 42:35.030
No. No, it's not.No.

42:35.074 --> 42:36.945
Right. Well, then...

42:36.989 --> 42:39.600
I look forward

42:39.644 --> 42:41.428
to getting to know the real you.

42:41.471 --> 42:44.213
And I you.

42:44.257 --> 42:48.043
Welcome back,
Charlotte Richards.
