00:00.100 --> 00:02.290
previously on "californication"...

00:02.300 --> 00:02.990
no kiss?

00:03.000 --> 00:03.990
I'm ne with that.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.990
You,on the other hand, have
been a very naughtylittle smurf.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.390
Bi-curious, are we?

00:08.400 --> 00:10.590
He started itspanking his assistant.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.190
It was very sweet,actually.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.790
I want to learn from you.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.090
I want to be an agent.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.090
I see.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.590
First, you systematicallydestroy
my marriage...

00:18.600 --> 00:20.490
I know about everything,charlie.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.690
And now you want meto
help with your career.

00:22.700 --> 00:23.790
I don't think you heard me.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.690
I wrote something.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.090
Hank wrote a new book?

00:26.100 --> 00:26.890
Can I read it?

00:26.900 --> 00:28.590
I don't thinkthat's appropriate.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.990
Is there anythingI can help you with?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.390
I wrote this novel,and I was just
wondering if charlie would read it.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.290
What's it about?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.090
A 16-year-old
girlfucks a much,

00:36.100 --> 00:40.090
much older man and finds herself
both spirituallyand sexually awakened.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.390
Dad, are you okay?

00:43.400 --> 00:44.790
No...

00:44.800 --> 00:46.490
but I'm working on it.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.890
This book is gonna be huge.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.190
What's going on here?Are you having
second thoughts?Are you questioning things?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.190
I question everything.It's very healthy.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.090
It is very healthy.

00:54.100 --> 00:59.090
I just think you can't run offand marry a
guy after making sweet loveto yours truly.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.990
We had women that loved us for
who we were,and we fucked it up.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.490

01:23.000 --> 01:24.290
Hey.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.490
You look great, mom.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.890
Oh, thank you,sweetie.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.190
I guess you're going witha
more liberal interpretation

01:29.200 --> 01:31.290
of the whole "white
wedding"concept, are you?

01:31.300 --> 01:32.790
Do you thinkI could
go braless -- ooh.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.290
Sorry.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.390
Didn't know we hada
gentleman in our presence.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.590
Well, only if you go witha more liberal
interpretation of the whole"gentleman" concept.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.790
Ouch.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.990
You know, as exciting as
it isto be behind the scenes

01:44.000 --> 01:45.990
in the girls' locker
roomright before the big game,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.490
I think I'm goingto take my leave.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.490
Oh, shit.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.790
I think my dad's coming.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.890
What?He was supposed to
beplaying racquetball.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.390
Yes, by all means,get that thing off.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.290
The groom should notsee you in the
dress just before the wedding --

01:58.300 --> 01:59.290
that's bad luck.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.890
What's worse luckis
getting married itself.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.190
Shut up.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.290
It's liketwo out of three
of those end in divorce.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.390
Sometimes more
--three out of two.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.389
- Bill.
- Hank.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.790
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.390
A little uncomfortablecoming from you.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.290
You know what?Oatmeal.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.690
Thank you, d...

02:18.700 --> 02:20.690
You should've seen the
dresskaren had on just now.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.390
She had the -- I mean,it
was like, here -- mm.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.390
Cut it out.And then the back...

02:25.400 --> 02:26.590
rrrah!

02:26.600 --> 02:28.290
- Hey.
- You're home early.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.990
Well, I played harry greenberg.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.090
I bageled him.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.190
Ah, ironically.

02:32.200 --> 02:32.890
You know what?

02:32.900 --> 02:34.490
One day, you and me,bill tilden.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.390
Mano a mano.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.390
We're gonna playthe real tennis.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.290
Not that sissy kind.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.290
We're going '70s style.We're
playing wooden rackets,knee socks.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.590
Plum smugglers.We do it.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.090
But not todaybecause I gotta go.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.390
- Dad.
- Yes.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.890
You can'T.Remember?

02:46.900 --> 02:47.590

02:47.600 --> 02:49.090

02:49.100 --> 02:49.990

02:52.800 --> 02:54.090
Family stuff.

02:54.100 --> 02:57.590
Well, we're a family.Or we
will be very soon, right?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.190
So I should say what I feel?

02:59.200 --> 03:00.390
No matter what?

03:00.400 --> 03:01.690
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.090
Always.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.390
I want to live with dad.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.090
I'll still visit and stuff.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.190
I just...

03:11.200 --> 03:13.490
I want to livemost of the time with dad.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.390
It's the firstI've heard of this.Karen.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.290
Karen.Karen!

03:19.300 --> 03:20.890
Karen!

03:22.100 --> 03:23.390

03:26.400 --> 03:28.190
Shit.Becca!

03:28.500 --> 03:29.690
Becca.

03:30.300 --> 03:31.390
Bill.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.090
Bill.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.090
Then there were two.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.190
Yeah.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.290
I'm gonna need some
helpgetting out of this dress.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.990
And then there was one.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.690
Uncle runkle.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.090
Sorry I'm late.I just, uh...

04:41.100 --> 04:42.590
you just what?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.090
Nah.That's all I got.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.890
I do have some news, though.

04:47.900 --> 04:48.990
Delight me.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.190
Becca's moving back in with me.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.890
- No shit.
- Yeah.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.690
- Poor karen.She must
be -- - devastated.

04:56.700 --> 04:57.790
That's brutal.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.990
Mm, it is.The good news
is, though, that as of today

05:00.000 --> 05:03.390
you and your extensive porn collection
are moving in to the four seasons.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.290
Fantastic.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.990
I booked you a room in the

05:06.000 --> 05:09.490
"husbands who've been kicked to the curb
by their diminutive lesbian wives" wing.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.290
That's right next to the "young
actresses fresh into town" wing.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.090
Am I correct?

05:13.100 --> 05:15.690
I don't know the layout of the hotel.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.190
Well, uh, that is news.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.690
Boy, um, I'll miss the camaraderie,

05:19.700 --> 05:23.190
but that stain in your bedroom
was really starting to unnerve me.

05:23.200 --> 05:26.590
You inspired that stain,
you cunning linguist, you.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.590
- It's a talent.
- Job well done.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.990
What were you doing in
my bedroom, you perv?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.390
Snooping, of course.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.090
Looking for some
fucking words I can sell.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.190
Good luck with that shit.

05:36.200 --> 05:40.990
By the way, how come you never told me bill's
little lolita of a daughter was a writer?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.890
'Cause I don't use that term loosely.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.290
Writer.Everybody says
they're a writer in this town.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.790
I'll give her "budding
wordsmith," maybe.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.090
"Budding," huh?

05:49.100 --> 05:51.190
- She's fuckin' bloomed, pal.
- ***

05:51.200 --> 05:53.490
Dani's dripping wet over
this manuscript of hers.

05:53.500 --> 05:57.590
In fact, she insists that I pump
it, launch her agenting career,

05:57.600 --> 06:01.590
or she's gonna hit me with the
mother of all sexual-harassment suits.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.890
Oh, charlie, I'm sorry.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.190
Do you think you can get mea
front-row seat to the trial?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.190
I'd like to be behind youin
all the courtroom sketches.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.190
You're such a good friend.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.490
What the fuckdo you want me to say?

06:10.500 --> 06:13.190
You fuck aroundwith your
assistant, you're gonna get screwed.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.590
There's only a few thingsthat
could happen, all of them bad.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.790
You're gonna get
threatened,you're gonna get sued.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.090
You can go for the
trifectaand get divorced.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.090
And yet,do I get any credit for
all the assistantsi didn't fuck?

06:24.100 --> 06:24.890
No, that's an injustice.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.190
It is.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.290
I get no credit forall
the dicks I do not suck.

06:31.000 --> 06:31.990
Check, please.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.890
Then again,I don't know.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.290
If -- if mia turns
outto really be talented,

06:35.300 --> 06:37.290
then I could pump thistill
I'm blue in the face.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.490
No harm no foul.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.590
Am I right there?

06:39.600 --> 06:44.290
She -- she might have sometalent, from
what I've seen, the little I have seen.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.990
What is this thing about?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.890
This coverage makes it
soundreally fuckin' hot, you know?

06:48.900 --> 06:51.790
There's this young womanwho's
bangin' this older guy,

06:51.800 --> 06:53.690
and at one point,
you know,she --

06:53.700 --> 06:55.990
she hauls off and just
punches himright in the face.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.090
That's -- that's pretty
ballsyright there, right?

06:59.300 --> 07:02.190
I don't know what else
happens,but that's one scene.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.390
Motherfucker.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.690
What?

07:07.600 --> 07:10.390
"Fucking & punching." Hmm.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.190
This is beyond ballsy.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.790
Where are you
-- Okay, then.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.590
What the fuck?

08:12.400 --> 08:13.490
I guessyou didn't hear me knocking.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.490
- No.
- No.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.990
Well, that's why
I letmyself in --

08:16.000 --> 08:19.690
because I figured you'd probably
be out herein this general vicinity,

08:19.700 --> 08:20.990
unableto hear me knocking.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.790
Out by the pool, kickin'
it,you know, after school?

08:23.800 --> 08:25.690
Right.Well, schooldoesn't
get out till 3:00.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.090
You need to get on top
of thatkind of shit, hank.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.590
Is that,like, universal?

08:29.600 --> 08:31.690
'Cause I was overat
mia's school that day,

08:31.700 --> 08:34.990
and it wasvery progressive, like maybe
they didn't adhereto that kind of strict --

08:35.000 --> 08:36.289
there's no one here.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.690
I'm all on my ownin my big, empty house,

08:38.700 --> 08:41.590
just like I will be when
youtake my daughter away from me.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.390
Come on, honey.I had
nothing to do with that.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.290
Oh, really?You didn'tput her up to it?

08:45.300 --> 08:47.290
No!Of course not.Why would I do that?

08:47.300 --> 08:48.890
Well, I don't know
--to embarrass me.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.290
To score some bigfucking
victory over bill.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.090
No, I wouldn't do that.

08:52.100 --> 08:52.990
Your usual shit.

08:53.000 --> 08:53.690
No.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.590
No, no, no.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.790
I wouldn't do that.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.790
What, so she justcame up with it
all by herself, out of the blue?

08:58.800 --> 09:01.090
The system that's been
workingfor us since we split up,

09:01.100 --> 09:02.390
that's not workinganymore?

09:02.400 --> 09:03.390
"I want to live with dad.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.790
I don't want to live with mom.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.890
" She's a teenager.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.790
I think the word you'relooking
for is "mercurial.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.490
" No, I'm
not looking --

09:09.700 --> 09:12.090
And I would neverfuck
with her head like that.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.390
Yours, yes.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.890
I can be a dick like thatsometimes.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.290
But hers, never.

09:16.300 --> 09:18.090
Not in a million years.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.090
Well, okay.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.090
What do you mean,"okay"?

09:21.100 --> 09:23.190
I mean,"okay, I believe you.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.490
" But it's not gonna makeany difference.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.490
It doesn't make itany easier for me.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.190
I know, but if you think
aboutit in practical terms,

09:28.200 --> 09:30.690
it just means, like, a
coupleextra nights a week, right?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.290
- I mean, it's
not a big -- - no.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.690
Don't, okay?Don't do that.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.190
I don't need yourfucking
sympathy, hank, okay?

09:37.200 --> 09:40.290
Get out of my house, 'cause I
don't wantto see you right now!

09:46.300 --> 09:48.890
Where's ilsa,she-wolf of the ss?

09:48.900 --> 09:49.890
Excuse me?

09:49.900 --> 09:51.390
Dani.Where's dani?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.890
She's -- she'sin a meeting
with, uh, mr.Runkle.

09:53.900 --> 09:54.690
And you are?

09:54.700 --> 09:56.490
- Going in there.
- I'm sorry, sir.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.690
Hey,look at the time -- the big hand
says "fuck"and the little hand says "off.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.190
" Good thing it doesn'thave
a second hand, huh?

10:01.200 --> 10:05.890
All right, I needto talk to you, and
you, and you need to get out,and you...

10:05.900 --> 10:09.690
you, I don't need to
talk to,but I know you.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.090
Hello, victoria.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.090
Well, so formal.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.990
"Tricky vicky" he used
tocall me back in the day.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.690
Where the hell have you been,hank moody?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.990
Haven't you owed me a book
sincethe good guy was in office?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.890
Yeah, it's been seven
years,thanks for asking.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.090
It's coming along swimmingly.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.390
Spell-checking as we speak.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.990
I need to have a chatwith you.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.490
I'm inthe middle of a meeting.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.590
I can see that.It won't take long.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.290
Hank, uh, do you think you two
could do thisa little bit later?

10:32.300 --> 10:35.590
Like after the meeting that
victoria flew infrom new york for?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.090
No.We shouldstraighten it out now.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.590
We have a bunch moreset up for later.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.690
We don't want themto stack up.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.390
Thank you, dani.I can handle this.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.090
Well, handle it, then.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.890
Looks like you've gota
live one there, runkle.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.390
Hank, have a seat.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.390
We can talkabout "chinese
democracy" as soon as

10:50.400 --> 10:53.090
I'm done talkingwith
the publishing sensation.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.390
I don't know if you're aware,

10:54.400 --> 10:57.390
but this young woman's written
what could bethe book of the year.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.390
Is that right?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.190
Have I ever been wrongabout this shit?

11:00.200 --> 11:01.490
It's fantastic.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.690
It's like your early stuff.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.690
Not so juvenile.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.690
Not so manylame boner jokes.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.390
Well, coincidentally,I
have a lame boner right now.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.490
I have a lame bonerfor justice.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.790
And if you won't give mea
private sidebar right now,

11:12.800 --> 11:15.090
maybe there's somethingyou'd
like to say to these good people?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.190
I don't know.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.390
What mightthey be interested in hearing?

11:18.400 --> 11:22.090
Come on, mia.Just
-- just out with it.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.690
wait.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.490
I know what I could say.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.990
Thank you, hank.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.990
Thank you for giving me
notesand helping me with this.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.790
It's beena dream come true, really,

11:36.800 --> 11:41.190
to have your favorite writerin the whole
wide world help youon your very first...

11:41.800 --> 11:43.090
...novel.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.790
Hank, you're so sweet.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.290
That's it?That's the
wayyou want to play it?

11:47.300 --> 11:50.090
What do you want me
to do,blow you, hank?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.690
I mean,that would be untoward.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.290
Oh, my god, look atthe
potty mouth on this one.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.890
I love it.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.290
She'd be greatwith the press, right?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.990
Like elizabeth wurtzel...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.190
with talent.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.990
Okay, hank.Let's go, huh?

12:02.900 --> 12:04.490
What the fuckis the matter with you?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.690
What do you have,
epilepsy,asperger's, tourette's?

12:06.700 --> 12:07.590
Good to see you, hank.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.090
Good luck with the spell-check.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.290
- I need to talk to you,charlie.
- Later.Later.I will talk to youlater.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.290
You can't pack her lunchfor
the next six months.

12:24.300 --> 12:24.990
I know.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.590
I'm just packing itfor tomorrow because,

12:26.600 --> 12:29.890
you know, I figured if I get
allthe sandwiches in for tomorrow,

12:29.900 --> 12:32.490
then, if he forgets,it's okay

12:32.500 --> 12:34.390
'cause, like, she has
sandwichesfor every day of the week.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.290
Stop stressing.Come
here.Come here.Come here.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.790
Okay.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.890
Oh, is mia backfrom her meeting yet?

12:44.900 --> 12:45.690
What meeting?

12:45.700 --> 12:46.890
She met with charlie.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.490
She's trying to getone of her
stories published.Isn't that great?

12:49.500 --> 12:50.490
Oh, wow, yeah.

12:50.500 --> 12:54.590
Yeah, I haven't read it, but my father's
intuition saysit's probably pretty special.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.290
Yes.Yeah.I'm sure it is.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.590
Have you, um,signed the papers yet?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.690
Oh, god.No, honey.Sorry.I forgot.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.790
I've beena little preoccupied.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.190
- I know.I know.Let's go.
- No, we got to go.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.390
- Come on.Come on.
- But, bill...

13:08.400 --> 13:09.590
we're gonnatake a look at this.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.990
Nah, this isimportant stuff.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.690
Look, we have our
prenup,we have our wills.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.790
Don't you careabout becca's trust fund?

13:17.800 --> 13:18.890
Yeah...

13:18.900 --> 13:20.090
no.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.190
Bill, I don'T.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.990
I don't care.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.090
All I care aboutis becca leaving me.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.590
Us.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.290
She's not leaving us.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.990
You know, she's moving out.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.090
She doesn'twant to live here anymore.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.890
I can't
tellwhat's worse --

13:36.900 --> 13:39.390
whether she doesn't knowshe's
ripping my heart out,

13:39.400 --> 13:42.090
or whether she does know, but,you
know, she just doesn't care.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.390
Honey, honey,it's a phase.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.690
She sees miaacting so independently,

13:47.700 --> 13:49.890
she probably wants to
seewhat that feels like,

13:49.900 --> 13:52.590
so she's doing the only
thingshe can to assert herself.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.390
What?Like getting awayfrom me?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.590
Like I'm the wicked witchof
the west or something?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.890
No, it's not about that,trust me.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.790
As soon asher father lets her down,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.890
she'll be begging you tobring
her back home, I promise.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.390
We're talking about hank,here.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.990
How longcan that possibly take?

14:07.900 --> 14:10.490
He'll probably disappoint heron the
car ride home and have to turn around.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.690
Don't make me laugh, 'causeI'm
trying to wallow here, okay?

14:23.700 --> 14:25.090
Thank youever so kindly.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.490
So you had your fun and then
you told themthe truth, right?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.190
Told them what, hank?

14:29.200 --> 14:33.290
You know, I think I'd appreciateyour
particular brand of humor a lot more

14:33.300 --> 14:35.390
if you weren'tfucking
around with my life.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.690
And you haven't fucked
aroundin mine at all?

14:37.700 --> 14:39.790
I mean, I know, I know
--it was an accident.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.790
How could youpossibly have known?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.890
The simple fact remains,you fucked me

14:43.900 --> 14:45.290
and you didn't want to
haveanything to do with me.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.990
That doesn't sit wellwith the ladies.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.290
So this is your revenge?

14:48.300 --> 14:50.490
You're some kind
offeminist caped crusader?

14:50.500 --> 14:53.490
Yeah, well, we all pay forour
sins sooner or later, hank.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.990
Thank you.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.290
How'd you get ahold of it?

14:56.300 --> 14:59.690
Well, it was just sitting
thereall unappreciated and shit,

14:59.700 --> 15:01.090
and I asked karenif I could read it.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.590
And she said "no.

15:02.600 --> 15:03.690
" Exactly.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.690
She was afraid that I
wouldget corrupted in some way.

15:06.700 --> 15:07.690
I'm sure.

15:07.700 --> 15:11.490
Oh, man.I wonder what'd she think if
she knew I that hadyour dick in my mouth.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.990
But I digress.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.290
Anyway,I took it to kinko's and settled
infor what was truly a great read.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.390
It's so good, hank.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.290
A really great first draft.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.290
You're gonna get caught,you know.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.390
People are gonna recognizemy writing.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.890
No, see,I covered my tracks.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.390
I added little bits of
mewhen I re-typed it.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.690
It's not really so muchan
outright theft as a mash-up.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.790
An homage, if you will.From me to you.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.590
You are a very young...

15:41.600 --> 15:43.990
sociopath-in-training.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.490
Oh, come on.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.590
That's like satan callingone of
his junior minions "a big meanie.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.590
" Yes, but I never set
outto hurt you, mia.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.190
What elseis out there for me, huh?!

15:52.200 --> 15:57.890
College, going to europe,working
at an agency, a network, a studio?

15:57.900 --> 15:59.390
Blech!Boring!

15:59.700 --> 16:01.190
This has been fun.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.790
I never intendedto be famous,

16:02.800 --> 16:06.390
but I do likebeing the
center of attention.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.290
It feelsjust like I
thought it would --

16:09.300 --> 16:11.190
totally fucking great.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.690
But it's gonna go away.

16:19.300 --> 16:22.190
Well, we just got offers from
victoria newsomeand little brown,

16:22.200 --> 16:25.090
but I think random house is
gonna blow themout of the water.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.090
Random house?

16:27.400 --> 16:29.990
I didn't even knowthey were
-- did I miss these calls?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.090
I didn't see messages.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.490
No, I didn't think it
wasworth bothering you about.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.490
Some kahlwith your coffee?

16:35.500 --> 16:37.190
We seem to be all outof champagne.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.990
I think the tv peopledrank it all when
they sold "slut wars"into syndication.

16:41.000 --> 16:41.990
No.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.590
- No, thank you
- don't mind if I do.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.990
It's been a great ride,charlie runkle.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.390
We proved sexand the workplace can
mix.We subvertedsome dominant paradigms.

16:52.400 --> 16:56.390
And froma feminist standpoint, we're
about to launcha major female writer.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.790
She was great,wasn't she?I mean,
she was poised,she was funny...

17:00.800 --> 17:04.990
she had themeating out of her hand and
looking up her skirtat the same time.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.089
Yeah,that is quite a feat.

17:07.099 --> 17:11.490
The girl's gonna sellfive million
copies based onthe jacket photo alone.

17:11.500 --> 17:15.190
And did you see how
completelyunfazed she was by hank?

17:15.200 --> 17:19.390
I mean, no offense,he's a cool guy,
but it was kind ofpathetic, right?

17:19.900 --> 17:23.490
Yeah, uh, dani, I actually have a
little bitof a headache, you know?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.690
I think I'm just gonna
lie downhere for a while.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.089
Okay.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.990
You rest,I'll take the calls.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.390
So, here's the lastof your t-shirts.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.790
Thanks.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.490
You know, you can
alwaysbring your stuff home,

18:00.500 --> 18:03.890
um, for me to washon
the weekends or whenever.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.390
I know.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.390
'Cause your dad,um, you know,

18:08.400 --> 18:12.290
he'll probablyjust buy you new
clothes when the old onesget dirty.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.390
That would
behis solution --

18:13.400 --> 18:15.190
mom, I know.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.290
You know.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.290
Yeah.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.590
Hey!

18:24.100 --> 18:26.290
Shit, you're nottaking
everything, are you?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.190
No.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.190
Just the essentials.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.690
I'm gonna let you guys
--give her a hand, yeah?

18:35.700 --> 18:36.790
Mom?

18:36.800 --> 18:38.190
Yeah?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.690
You and me...

18:39.700 --> 18:42.790
I was thinking next saturdaywe
could go to the getty.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.190
Just us.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.090
That'd be great.I'd love that, sweetie.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.090
And so it begins.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.790
The non-custodialparent time, hmm?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.690
Oh, hey,not the dark side of the
moon.I might wantto borrow that one.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.390
It's way too smallfor you.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.490
Uh, yeah.That's why I like it.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.090
Whatever.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.690
Hey,I was just teasing.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.490
That's what sisters do,you know?

19:09.500 --> 19:12.490
They borrow clothes,talk about boys,

19:12.500 --> 19:15.190
conspire againstthe parental units...

19:18.200 --> 19:20.590
You know, it's not gonnaeany
fun here without you.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.190
Was it fun before?

19:22.900 --> 19:23.990
Hmm, true.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.890
But, hey, you're not gonna havethat
problem anymore living with your dad.

19:26.900 --> 19:27.890
Sure.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.490
It'll be a hoot.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.190
Like taking kafkato the
third street promenade.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.890
You're noteven excited a little bit?

19:34.900 --> 19:36.390
I suppose.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.390
Well, shit,I would be stoked.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.390
'Cause your dad, I mean,he's a riot.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.990
He's totally awesome.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.790
I'm not going to live
withmy dad because it's fun.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.090
I'm goingbecause I have to.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.190
I don't knowif you've noticed,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.690
but your dadis about to marry my mom.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.890
Yeah, so?

19:53.900 --> 19:55.590
So it's really happening.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.590
He can't pretend anymorethat it's not.

19:59.700 --> 20:03.290
And whatevermiraculous thing he thought
w going to happenwith the writing...

20:03.300 --> 20:05.290
他在纽约写信回来

20:05.300 --> 20:08.090
那曾是对我们所有人的偿还

20:08.300 --> 20:11.290
很显然 那也没发生

20:11.800 --> 20:13.190
是啊 我猜也不会

20:13.200 --> 20:14.790
所以很正式

20:15.300 --> 20:16.990
最底线

20:17.000 --> 20:18.890
The death of hope

20:19.600 --> 20:21.390
现在不能不管他

20:21.800 --> 20:23.690
他一无所有

20:24.100 --> 20:26.290
不完全是这样的

20:27.800 --> 20:29.790
他还有你

20:31.400 --> 20:33.390
我们都会很幸运的

21:07.400 --> 21:09.590
爱死你的新小说了

21:15.300 --> 21:17.090
从头到尾我都很清楚

21:19.400 --> 21:21.790
也很奇怪 象1987年的风格

21:21.800 --> 21:23.690
我和Bret Easton Ellis一起去了派对

21:23.700 --> 21:25.190
我问他有哪些年轻作家

21:25.200 --> 21:27.390
他便把你的小说拿给我看

21:27.800 --> 21:29.590
读的时候我也有同感

21:29.600 --> 21:32.890
好象我和这家伙心有灵犀似的

21:32.900 --> 21:35.190
好象我们要一起干点事情

21:35.200 --> 21:38.490
你在那看见我 真让我一阵狂喜

21:38.500 --> 21:40.490
你早已和那相安无事了 伙计

21:40.500 --> 21:43.490
可你听着 我得问问

21:43.900 --> 21:46.990
自从你要写点什么东西开始...

21:50.100 --> 21:52.090
到底他妈怎么回事啊?

22:00.400 --> 22:02.890
这段时间里你搞的一塌糊涂

22:02.900 --> 22:06.190
我觉得你不会那么做

22:06.500 --> 22:08.190
不是故意的

22:08.200 --> 22:10.690
她在这事上忽悠了你?
太难以置信了

22:10.700 --> 22:12.890
她那时在家书店里看着我的书

22:12.900 --> 22:15.190
那可是搭话的决好时刻

22:15.200 --> 22:19.090
她很火辣 我都快把持不住了

22:19.100 --> 22:20.690
那时候可真是太棒了

22:20.700 --> 22:23.090
那晚我极不情愿和她一起

22:23.100 --> 22:27.290
我不知道她是Bill的女儿
我以为她还是个大学生

22:27.300 --> 22:29.190
或是岁数更大点

22:30.100 --> 22:31.490
我弄错了

22:31.500 --> 22:34.090
天那

22:34.100 --> 22:36.390
这事我们该怎么办呢?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.390
多谢你说了"我们"

22:40.000 --> 22:42.590
你说啥我都照办 知道不

22:42.900 --> 22:45.790
我豁出去了 只要你发话

22:45.800 --> 22:46.990
还有其他选择不?

22:47.000 --> 22:47.890
很多

22:47.900 --> 22:49.390
这下我可完蛋了

22:49.400 --> 22:51.890
我说啥 做啥

22:51.900 --> 22:53.790
都已经无济于事

22:53.800 --> 22:58.190
她都会告诉Karen Bill或是Becca

22:58.200 --> 22:59.790
靠 那群警察

23:00.800 --> 23:02.590
靠他妈警察

23:05.700 --> 23:07.390
是谁?

23:12.600 --> 23:13.590
等等

23:15.300 --> 23:16.690
我去看看

23:19.400 --> 23:20.890
晚上好 女士们

23:20.900 --> 23:21.890
嘿

23:21.900 --> 23:23.990
- 我要走了 电话联系
- 好的

23:24.000 --> 23:25.190
一直保持联系

23:26.700 --> 23:28.590
- 晚安
- 晚安

23:33.500 --> 23:35.790
- 我去把我的东西拿下来
- 好的

23:40.300 --> 23:41.790
很抱歉

23:41.800 --> 23:43.290
什么?

23:44.500 --> 23:45.890
你赢了

23:46.800 --> 23:48.190
如果你不开心

23:48.200 --> 23:49.890
我什么都没赢

23:50.700 --> 23:52.590
我不想看到你沮丧的样子

23:52.600 --> 23:54.190
从来都不

23:55.300 --> 23:58.090
也许除了你和Bill做过爱后

23:58.700 --> 23:59.590
就一个笑容

23:59.600 --> 24:03.190
不过 你一个浅浅的微笑 我便会很开心

24:03.700 --> 24:04.890
别担心 妈

24:05.000 --> 24:06.190
我没事

24:06.200 --> 24:09.190
我知道 我没担心你

24:09.200 --> 24:10.790
我知道

24:10.800 --> 24:13.090
不过 首先 这可不是再见

24:13.400 --> 24:15.690
就当作是我在乐队的成长之路

24:15.700 --> 24:17.990
去外地做些演出

24:18.300 --> 24:20.490
也省得你被我的吉他吵着了

24:20.500 --> 24:22.690
不过我很喜欢的喧闹的吉他声

24:24.200 --> 24:26.190
我该说"好好照看她"

24:26.200 --> 24:28.890
不过我觉得她更会照顾你

24:28.900 --> 24:30.590
同意

24:30.600 --> 24:33.290
有什么需要联系我

24:33.500 --> 24:34.890
任何事情

24:37.800 --> 24:39.190
我爱你 宝贝

24:39.500 --> 24:41.390
我也爱你

24:45.100 --> 24:47.890
她太动情了

24:48.500 --> 24:50.390
所有美好时刻她都这样

24:51.800 --> 24:56.890
作为交换 
他们也说他们只会对抗基地组织

24:58.200 --> 24:59.590
我们来照一张

24:59.600 --> 25:00.890
留住此刻

25:05.200 --> 25:06.590
你还好不

25:06.800 --> 25:08.290
看你样子听沮丧的

25:09.000 --> 25:10.590
你什么意思 比平常更沮丧吗

25:10.600 --> 25:13.990
是啊 我觉察到这些事了

25:14.700 --> 25:15.990
是么

25:16.800 --> 25:18.290
我好极了

25:21.500 --> 25:23.190
相信我

25:51.300 --> 25:52.890
嘿 Bill

25:53.800 --> 25:56.390
嘿 宝贝 Bill?
