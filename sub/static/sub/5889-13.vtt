00:12.889 --> 00:16.381
Our suspect is patient, calm.

00:16.893 --> 00:19.555
He likely spends hours
scouting the prey.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.977
He's only interested in big men.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.273
Ones who are hard to take down,
like the big bucks in the wild.

00:25.943 --> 00:30.061
Now, you're looking
for an incredibly smart offender...

00:30.281 --> 00:31.316
...highly organized.

00:31.824 --> 00:34.201
White male, likely 35 to 40.

00:34.410 --> 00:39.029
It is the sport that he's seduced by,
the ritual of the hunt.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.160
When he does finally make his move,
it happens fast...

00:43.044 --> 00:45.581
...striking, blitz-style attack,
most never see coming.

00:45.796 --> 00:50.256
His heart-shot prey rarely make it
over 100 feet before bleeding out.

00:50.468 --> 00:53.210
That moment is everything to him.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.344
The rush of control.

00:55.556 --> 01:00.391
The typical mutilation killer focuses
on a speciﬁc area of the anatomy...

01:00.603 --> 01:03.640
...that suits their interest.
The face, the eyes or mouth...

01:03.856 --> 01:07.599
...the extremities, hands,
breasts, genitalia. But this one's different.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.436
He ’3 interested in total domination
of the body.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.489
He guts them, removing the organs
with surgical precision...

01:14.700 --> 01:17.783
...but then leaving them in a pile.
But these aren't sex crimes...

01:17.995 --> 01:21.283
...which indicates they are instead
crimes of domination...

01:21.499 --> 01:25.162
...an effort on his part
to gain control over men...

01:25.378 --> 01:27.664
who,
based on their physical similarities...

01:27.880 --> 01:31.168
...represent a man
who once had dominance over him.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.215
A father, an older brother.

01:33.427 --> 01:39.013
It is my belief that the Deer Hunter
is, in fact, a very slight, rather weak man.

01:39.225 --> 01:40.465
Yes, blue shirt.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.016
They say he takes a souvenir.

01:42.228 --> 01:44.970
It's not a souvenir.
It's a final act of domination.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.681
While his prey's body is still warm...

01:47.900 --> 01:52.064
...he carves out the liver
and takes a single ceremonial bite.

02:00.288 --> 02:03.746
Man, we had a deal.
| testify against Keen and her husband...

02:03.958 --> 02:06.700
...| tell you how they killed
the harbormaster, and I walk.

02:06.919 --> 02:10.332
When the trial's over. Until then,
you're being charged as an accessory.

02:10.548 --> 02:11.913
I told you everything.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.964
Yeah. And because of that...

02:14.176 --> 02:18.840
...you're gonna be the star witness in the
murder trial of FBI Agent Elizabeth Keen.

02:19.056 --> 02:22.344
You're gonna testify in open court,
testify before the grand jury.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.518
You're gonna be deposed
until you're blue in the face.

02:25.730 --> 02:28.597
And if you change your story
by so much as a comma...

02:28.816 --> 02:30.647
...your immunity deal will be voided...

02:30.860 --> 02:35.229
...and you're gonna go to prison
for the rest of your life. Am I clear?

02:36.949 --> 02:38.485
Yeah.

02:42.997 --> 02:46.489
-Yes?
-Sorry I cut our previous call short.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.166
l was not conﬁdent
the line was secure.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.039
-Tell me your name.
-Not yet.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.538
Then you have me at a disadvantage.

02:53.758 --> 02:54.793
Yes.

02:55.009 --> 02:58.922
Alan Fitch directed me to that safe.
Your number was inside.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.844
He wanted us to talk. Why?

03:01.057 --> 03:02.422
What does he want me to know?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.677
-It is happening.
-What is?

03:04.894 --> 03:07.761
-What's happening?
-No, not like this. In person.

03:07.980 --> 03:11.143
Two p.m. tomorrow.
Broadway and 92nd.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.940
Center island, south side.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.853
A graduate seminar.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.314
Was there a slide show?

03:19.533 --> 03:23.196
-We need to talk about the Fulcrum.
-I told you, I don't know anything about it.

03:23.412 --> 03:27.576
Elizabeth, one of the reasons
I'm still alive is due to my love of reading.

03:28.167 --> 03:32.786
Whether it be words on a page
that reveal the author's thoughts...

03:33.005 --> 03:35.212
...emotions, imagination...

03:35.424 --> 03:37.631
...or whether it be people
in conversation...

03:37.843 --> 03:39.219
...to ignore what they say...

03:39.428 --> 03:41.805
...and instead read their expression...

03:42.264 --> 03:45.006
...posture, their gesture.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.057
Lizzy, you're lying.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.395
I'm not.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.395
What if we made a deal?

03:51.607 --> 03:54.815
| help you find your serial killer,
and you tell me about the Fulcrum.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.143
You're not even interested
in serial killers.

03:57.363 --> 04:01.732
True. I find them unimaginative
and woefully predictable.

04:01.951 --> 04:06.285
But I am interested in the cases
that you and the FBI have wrong.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.613
-Wrong?
-The most critical assumption...

04:08.833 --> 04:12.291
...you're making
about the Deer Hunter is wrong.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.962
Do we have a deal or not?

04:19.009 --> 04:23.753
This brute they call the Deer Hunter
isn't a buck at all...

04:23.973 --> 04:25.929
...but instead a delicate doe.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.303
-A woman?
-I disagree with you.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.261
Okay. But your killer attacks
from a distance...

04:31.480 --> 04:36.065
...indicating the predator's smaller,
perhaps unable to overpower their prey.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.063
Men tend to kill in close proximity.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.112
Strangulation, blunt instrument,
a knife.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.110
By contrast,
women tend to favor weapons...

04:44.326 --> 04:47.784
...that can be used from further away.
Poison, a gun, a crossbow.

04:47.997 --> 04:51.034
Richard Kuklinski was 6'5",
300 pounds...

04:51.250 --> 04:54.287
...and one of his favorite weapons
of choice was cyanide.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.289
Yes, but male serial killers...

04:56.505 --> 05:00.123
...are predominantly,
overwhelmingly sexually sadistic.

05:00.342 --> 05:03.755
In this case, there is not the slightest
indication of a sexual motive.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.963
Aileen Wuornos was a prostitute
who lured her victims...

05:07.183 --> 05:08.548
...in with the promise of sex.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.895
The Deer Hunter has been active
for over a decade...

05:12.104 --> 05:15.596
...from the truck driver in Des Moines
in 2003...

05:15.816 --> 05:17.898
...to the doorman in Adams Morgan
last night.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.691
That's 12 years.

05:19.904 --> 05:23.738
The average length of a killing spree
for a man is two, perhaps three.

05:23.949 --> 05:28.113
Yes, Agent Keen,
for every rule there is an exception.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.695
Each factor, taken separately,
is not conclusive...

05:30.915 --> 05:33.201
...but put them together and it's clear...

05:33.417 --> 05:36.250
...you haven't found your man
because he's a woman.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.294
Agent Keen, the ME called.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.998
He just finished his autopsy
on the latest victim.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.843
I used to have a teeming mane
just like that.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.097
Thank you.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.184
Every kill is identical.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.777
Same clean incisions
at the stomach and the liver...

06:00.986 --> 06:02.647
...same knots binding the anus.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.103
No variations?

06:04.323 --> 06:06.860
When field dressing's done well,
it's like an autopsy.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.658
The way he opens subjects,
I wanna show you....

06:10.120 --> 06:11.326
What is it?

06:11.914 --> 06:13.495
I left that body covered.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.958
The hallway. That was him.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.498
He was at my lecture.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.827
Hey, you! Brown coat, stop!

06:21.131 --> 06:23.713
-Hands where I can see them!
-Okay, okay. Just my phone!

06:23.926 --> 06:25.257
-Hands!
-Okay.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.300
It's just my phone, okay?

06:43.320 --> 06:45.527
Stop looking at me like that.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.612
I'm fine.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.821
I'll be fine.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.156
It's not--
I don't like it any more than you do.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.453
But someone has to do this.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.889
This is Chad Henning.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.555
Mommy has to go across town
to see him.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.027
To see Chad Henning.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.738
I won't be long.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.536
What were you doing
in the ME's office?

07:39.752 --> 07:42.289
I told you, I write Metro Crime Diary.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.711
That's why I was at your lecture.
Research.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.584
No research in that rag sheet.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.004
It's gossip and innuendo.
So, what were you really doing there?

07:50.220 --> 07:52.711
You used fake credentials
to get into the ME's office.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.219
You took my phone. You know
all I was doing was taking pictures.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.768
You're obsessed with serial killers.
You write about them all the time.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.266
How do we know
you're not the Deer Hunter?

08:04.360 --> 08:07.773
-You're not looking for the Deer Hunter.
-What's that supposed to mean?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.855
The first six victims,
Mark Rodgers through Perry Holloman...

08:11.075 --> 08:12.406
...he was experimenting.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.444
The field dressing became cleaner,
he switched from a folder to a field blade.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.905
We didn't overlook.
He was learning, evolving.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.581
Evolving implies
that he wanted to improve.

08:21.794 --> 08:22.874
You saying he didn't?

08:23.087 --> 08:26.705
The techniques and incisions used
on the last six victims are all identical.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.165
The Deer Hunter loved to explore.

08:29.385 --> 08:30.875
No way he would repeat himself.

08:31.095 --> 08:34.883
-You think we're dealing with a copycat.
-The Deer Hunter is an artist.

08:35.099 --> 08:37.135
The guy you're looking for is a forger.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.188
-Keen.
-Agent Keen?

08:45.401 --> 08:49.610
It's Detective Wilcox. I don't know if you
remember. We spoke some time ago.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.904
Yes, detective.
I remember you were looking...

08:52.116 --> 08:54.448
...into the disappearance
of the DC. harbormaster.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.821
Yeah.
It's not a missing-persons case anymore.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.072
We recovered the body.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.822
I'm sorry to hear that.
I was hoping for better news.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.706
Yeah. Well, I need you to tell me
what you know.

09:06.922 --> 09:12.007
I'd like to, but as I told you, the reason
I came in contact with the harbormaster...

09:12.511 --> 09:15.924
...the case I was working on at the time,
it's classified.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.051
That's not gonna fly anymore.

09:18.517 --> 09:22.180
See, the thing is, recovering the body
is not the only development in the case.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.354
I also found Samuel Aleko.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.642
He places you at the scene,
Agent Keen.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.604
You and your ex-husband.
He tells quite a story.

09:32.823 --> 09:34.779
Says the two of you
are stone-cold killers.

09:34.992 --> 09:38.610
Even if I wanted to answer questions,
before I could talk, you'd need to get--

09:38.829 --> 09:42.037
A federal judge to rule that
my investigation supersedes your case.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.284
It's in the works.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.701
An AUSA's gonna sit down
with Mr. Aleko, hear what he has to say.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.708
And I have no doubt that,
as a result of that conversation...

09:50.924 --> 09:53.210
...a petition's gonna be filed
in federal court...

09:53.427 --> 09:55.793
...requesting
that I have complete access...

09:56.013 --> 09:58.345
...to any of your allegedly
classiﬁed information.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.888
This conversation is over.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.508
Well, I think it's just beginning.

10:25.209 --> 10:27.621
-Hello, Edgar.
-Mr. Reddington.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.828
Samuel Aleko will be transferred
tomorrow afternoon.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.413
That's not gonna work.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.877
You asked to talk to the guy.
This is the window.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.300
He leaves the V street station
between 2 and 4.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.593
You have to reschedule.
There's somewhere else I need to be.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.221
You know I'd do anything for you,
Mr. Reddington...

10:44.436 --> 10:49.305
...but, I mean, this thing's in motion.
This is the window. It is what it is.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.104
-Cinnamon-nut crumble?
-Brown-sugar pecan.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.821
Oh, my.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.770
Lucinda knows how you love her cake.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.696
Oh, I do.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.403
Be well, Edgar, and tell Lucinda if she
ever leaves you, I'd like to marry her.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.706
Just remember,
tomorrow between 2 and 4.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.927
I've been through every case file. I'll be
damned if Kruse doesn't have a point.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.970
The last six kills are identical.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.174
We assumed because
he'd perfected his craft.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.804
No room for improvement.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.397
The more I look at it,
the more I think we're wrong.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.437
That there really is a copycat.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.732
Ijust can't prove it.

11:34.403 --> 11:37.190
-What is it?
-What? Nothing.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.862
Come on, Keen. What is it?

11:39.074 --> 11:40.439
I know you. Where's your head?

11:40.659 --> 11:44.197
That cop, the one investigating
the harbormaster?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.286
He's got evidence.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.533
He found the body.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.159
And the witness.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.375
-Did he talk?
-I think he did, yes.

11:56.592 --> 12:00.335
-It's your word against his.
-|'ve hidden for as long as I can...

12:00.554 --> 12:03.136
...told him I couldn't talk
because it was classified...

12:03.348 --> 12:05.509
...but he's taking the case
to a federal judge.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.512
Tom is the one who killed this guy.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.343
But I was there.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.394
-I should have--
-What, stopped him?

12:11.732 --> 12:14.223
-Liz, you tried.
-They'll have enough to arrest me.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.980
Then go to Cooper,
ask him to talk to the AUSA.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.356
Last thing he wants
is some cop poking around...

12:19.573 --> 12:21.689
...asking questions about what we do.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.615
Liz, listen to me.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.283
Tom may have killed this guy...

12:25.495 --> 12:28.237
...but "FBI agent goes to prison"
is the headline.

12:28.457 --> 12:31.494
All they're gonna care about
is taking a bite out of y--

12:33.003 --> 12:34.994
-That's it.
-What?

12:35.714 --> 12:37.670
Kruse was right about the copycat.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.214
I can prove it.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.223
Sorry.
I don't mean to second-guess you.

12:49.645 --> 12:52.603
Oh, Mary, please.
You have nothing to apologize for.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.475
It's just my son....

12:54.691 --> 12:56.227
If anything were to happen to me.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.560
Nothing's going to happen to you
oryourson.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.897
It's entirely natural for you
to feel this way...

13:03.116 --> 13:04.731
...to have second thoughts.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.364
If you didn't, I'd be very concerned.

13:07.579 --> 13:10.412
-If there was any other way--
-You've tried every other way.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.116
You've been reasonable, worked
within the system, begged, pleaded.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.248
-I know, but--
-Mary, look at me.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.748
Is there evil in your life?

13:25.055 --> 13:30.516
-Yes.
-Is it notjust and right to eliminate evil?

13:35.399 --> 13:36.935
Say it.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.022
-Yes.
-So...

13:45.867 --> 13:48.904
...are you in or are you out?

13:49.121 --> 13:51.032
I need to know...

13:51.248 --> 13:57.539
...because if this comes back on me,
it's going to come back on us both.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.790
Do you understand?

14:02.843 --> 14:03.878
I'm in.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.085
Well, that's good.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.882
Then it's done.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.098
I pulled the forensics like you asked...

14:12.310 --> 14:15.017
...had the lab compare the bite marks
left on each liver...

14:15.230 --> 14:17.812
...for the first six kills
with those from the last six.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.640
-What are you doing?
-What? Nothing.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.853
I'm updating the team.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.354
-Aram?
-Yeah?

14:22.571 --> 14:24.482
-The bite marks.
-Right.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.073
Turns out the distance measurements
on the upper arch...

14:28.285 --> 14:32.449
...are 2.8 percent wider in the first
six victims than in the second six.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.996
Two different bites
of the proverbial apple.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.243
Nice work, Ressler.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.416
It's official,
we're looking for a copycat.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.209
-Are you sure you have your glasses?
-Yes.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.383
Mrs. Jost called me again
about you squinting at the blackboard.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.337
-It's why you keep getting headaches.
-It's not the glasses.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.218
-Mrs. Jost just has crappy handwriting.
-Language.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.267
Okay, don't forget,
your father is gonna pick you up after--

14:55.479 --> 14:57.595
Elsa, honey, what is it?
The bus is here.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.768
Oh, my—-

15:08.700 --> 15:10.361
We're very sorry for your loss.

15:10.577 --> 15:15.071
-How long were the two of you married?
-Five years, together almost nine.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.871
Ijust....

15:17.417 --> 15:19.624
This can't be happening.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.498
The Deer Hunter, right?

15:22.714 --> 15:26.502
-The killer on the news?
-We're limited in what we can disclose...

15:26.718 --> 15:29.209
...but the Deer Hunter
has a very specific method.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.638
The manner of death,
the treatment of the body...

15:34.226 --> 15:36.217
...it's consistent with his profile.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.142
I knew something was wrong.

15:38.355 --> 15:42.064
Chad works in construction,
and he didn't come home after work.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.982
We have a son. He's only 4.
What am I supposed to tell him?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.401
You tell him...

15:46.613 --> 15:48.478
...we're gonna find whoever did this.

15:49.908 --> 15:54.026
How? According to the papers,
you don't even have a suspect.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.986
We have some promising
new theories.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.742
Actually, one in particular.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.166
This may not be the work
of the actual Deer Hunter.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.959
-It's a copycat.
-We shouldn't--

16:03.171 --> 16:04.786
No, it's okay.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.382
She deserves to know.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.843
We're getting closer to the truth.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.460
That's....

16:12.013 --> 16:13.753
Thank you.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.051
No, thank you.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.509
We appreciate your time.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.772
I can only imagine
how difficult this must be for you.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.529
What the hell was that?

16:35.745 --> 16:38.873
She was covering. I don't know what,
but that woman knows something.

16:39.082 --> 16:42.700
I picked up on that. Since when do you
hand a person of interest your profile?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.329
My profile is wrong.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.754
Nothing specific connecting
the original Deer Hunter's victims...

16:47.966 --> 16:51.333
...other than the physical.
But the copycat, his victims--

16:51.553 --> 16:54.340
-Copycat's targeting a specific type?
-What if he is?

16:54.556 --> 16:56.842
I had assumed
he was operating like the original.

16:57.434 --> 17:01.643
But what if he chose those victims
based on a different unifying reason?

17:01.855 --> 17:05.723
He could be masking his agenda, making
it look like the work of a different killer.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.433
Maybe there's something
in the victims' histories.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.030
-But how does Mary Henning fit in?
-Don't know yet.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.274
But I rattled her.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.232
We should let her stew
and take another run at her tomorrow.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.925
-Yes?
-Who the hell are you?

17:38.767 --> 17:42.225
-Mr. Reddington asked me to--
-Why are you wearing a sidearm?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.520
-He needs to reschedule.
-That's not how it works.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.024
I told him to come alone.
I gave very specific instructions.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.448
Mr. Reddington's a man of his word.
If it were possible, he'd be here.

17:56.660 --> 17:58.821
Wherever he is,
whatever the hell he's doing...

17:59.371 --> 18:01.487
...I hope it's important.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.798
What the hell's going on?

18:21.184 --> 18:22.469
Hang tight, pal.

18:25.897 --> 18:28.058
Ninety seconds.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.535
When I was young,
I wanted to be able to dance...

18:45.750 --> 18:50.039
...just like Gary Goddard. I still remember
going to the snowflake dance...

18:50.255 --> 18:53.463
...and watching him for the first time.
That kid, man, he could move.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.508
Won the eighth-grade talent show.
He was on the yell squad.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.132
Gary even danced his way
into Helen Hummer's pants...

18:59.347 --> 19:02.214
...and let me tell you,
that was like breaking into Fort Knox.

19:02.434 --> 19:05.096
-Pops, who the hell are you?
-Then in the summer of '88...

19:05.312 --> 19:09.146
...I saw Gary in the diaper aisle
at Safeway.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.557
He looked like hell.

19:11.943 --> 19:16.687
Gray, out of breath, fatigued.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.825
Turns out Gary had a bicuspid valve,
needed a heart transplant.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.534
He was on the wait list
until the day he died.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.374
How long has Isaac been
on the list now?

19:31.963 --> 19:36.753
-How do you know about my brother?
-Six months? A year? Two?

19:38.094 --> 19:40.801
How long is he gonna have to wait?

19:41.056 --> 19:42.216
They won't say.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.592
I can get your brother a heart
within the week.

19:47.020 --> 19:53.983
Best surgeons, best post-op care,
and it won't cost you a dime.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.809
Why would you do that for me?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.776
Because you're gonna do something
for me.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.574
We found the link,
or at least what could be the link.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.904
Seven victims, so we started over
with the most basic question.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.660
-"Do they know each other?"
-That theory died quickly.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.458
Seven victims all from different states,
different ages.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.581
No schools in common,
no family relations.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.005
Not connected,
but something about them is?

20:17.217 --> 20:19.378
Makes sense,
but everything we tried was a bust.

20:19.594 --> 20:23.303
Maybe the one thing we know about the
victims is the one thing holding us back.

20:23.515 --> 20:26.552
Maybe the victims aren't victims.
Not entirely.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.679
Joseph Riggs,
the copycat's second target.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.101
The guy had a rap sheet...

20:30.313 --> 20:32.645
...including a conviction
for misdemeanor menacing.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.065
Pointed a knife at his girlfriend,
said he'd kill her if she left him.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.563
Which brings us to target four,
Andrew Cosgrove.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.486
Divorced from his second wife, Diane.

20:40.698 --> 20:44.065
Transcript for a court proceeding
makes reference to a restraining order.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.152
-That's two. What about the others?
-Number five, Judd Liggett.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.658
No criminal record,
but before he was murdered...

20:49.874 --> 20:52.536
...he was disciplined
by the program he was attending.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.209
After complaints were made
by a female student.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.789
Aggravated harassment. Nonstop
phone calls, stalking her in class.

20:59.008 --> 21:03.047
Girl was terrified, but no charges were
filed. That's why it wasn't on our radar.

21:03.263 --> 21:08.053
Stalkers, obsessive types, who get violent
when the women they want reject them.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.725
That's what Mary Henning was hiding.
She was afraid of her husband.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.223
Whoever killed him
might have been protecting her.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.932
If we're right, these seven men had
dangerous fixations on seven women.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.234
The copycat killer
was protecting those women.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.483
But they were in different states. How'd
the killer know they were in danger?

21:22.699 --> 21:26.863
Hang on. Diane Cosgrove got legal help
with her divorce from a local nonprofit.

21:27.078 --> 21:30.536
Docket One. Student advocacy group
that went after Judd Liggett was called.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.488
-Bright Voice.
-Bright-- Bright Voice.

21:32.709 --> 21:36.372
They're both affiliates
of a national organization called...

21:36.588 --> 21:38.544
Whitehaven Shelters.

21:38.756 --> 21:42.374
We are the largest nonprofit victims'
assistance association in the US.

21:42.594 --> 21:45.882
Every year, there are seven million
victims of harassment and stalking.

21:46.097 --> 21:49.260
We help to provide those people
with legal, medical, social services.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.387
Do you keep records?

21:51.603 --> 21:55.095
-Of course. Why?
-It's our understanding these women...

21:55.315 --> 21:57.681
...obtained aid
from your Whitehaven affiliates.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.189
We'd like to know everything we could
about your interaction with them.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.986
As you can imagine,
we take privacy very seriously here.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.781
-You have a court order?
-We'll get one if necessary.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.575
Unless there's some danger
of imminent threat or harm...

22:09.787 --> 22:12.039
-...I don't feel--
-Fami|iar with Chad Henning?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.204
-Name sounds familiar.
-It should.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.701
His body was found hanging from a tree
this morning in Takoma Park.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.794
You're talking
about the serial murders.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.713
Chad was the husband of Mary...

22:22.926 --> 22:26.714
...who received legal counsel from
a free clinic provided by Whitehaven.

22:26.930 --> 22:31.344
Names on that list were in relationships
with victims of the Deer Hunter.

22:31.559 --> 22:35.097
The only other thing those seven women
have in common is your organization.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.895
It's possible
the person committing these murders...

22:38.107 --> 22:40.439
...interacted with these women
through Whitehaven.

22:40.652 --> 22:44.861
We're gonna need a full list
of your employees and volunteers.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.110
I'll get you everything.
Give me a few hours to put it together.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.361
Thank you.

23:05.635 --> 23:08.627
I know, I'm-- I'm overreacting, right?

23:08.846 --> 23:11.838
I mean, I don't know
if she talked with the FBI.

23:12.058 --> 23:15.550
But if Mary did talk...

23:15.937 --> 23:17.268
...she'd expose everyone.

23:18.481 --> 23:19.891
And I don't care about myself.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.896
But the other women....

23:24.112 --> 23:26.979
I have to do something, right?

23:27.198 --> 23:29.280
You're right. I'm overreacting.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.528
I should just relax.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.699
She'd never betray me.
None of them would.

23:41.838 --> 23:44.170
The last victim's wife,
the one you let stew...

23:44.382 --> 23:47.374
-...you did a great job. She is boiling over.
-She called?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.676
Got off the phone with her.
She wants to talk.

23:49.887 --> 23:50.922
Let's go, Keen.

23:51.139 --> 23:54.176
If you're here because you wanna
give me more unsolicited advice--

23:54.392 --> 23:58.135
Tempting as that may be,
I'm here to speak to Agent Mojtabai.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.179
No one ever calls me that.

24:07.989 --> 24:12.608
Aram, I need your assistance
locating the source of a call...

24:12.827 --> 24:15.660
...that was placed to a pay phone
at 92nd and Broadway.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.908
-I need a warrant.
-You won't need a warrant.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.365
-I won't need a warrant.
-This is the number.

24:20.585 --> 24:23.873
The call was placed
at exactly 2 pm. yesterday.

24:25.006 --> 24:26.212
-Aram?
-Yes.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.507
I can't stress enough
the urgency of this matter.

24:42.273 --> 24:45.185
Thank you for coming. I--

24:45.401 --> 24:47.016
Tracy, hello.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.567
I was expecting someone else.

24:48.780 --> 24:49.940
We have a situation.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.573
-What is it? What happened?
-The FBI found the connection.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.949
They came to Whitehaven,
asking for the names of every employee.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.031
The FBI, they came,
but I didn't say anything, I promise.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.211
Who were you expecting?

25:08.508 --> 25:10.499
Friends for book club.

25:11.594 --> 25:12.925
Oh, you're lying.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.172
It's you.

25:14.389 --> 25:15.674
You're the weak link.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.131
After what you've done for me, for us?

25:18.351 --> 25:22.060
Tracy, honestly, before you,
I was in a desperate situation.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.432
You saw the marks.
He threatened to kill me.

25:24.649 --> 25:28.938
I tried the police, all the right channels,
and no one lifted a finger.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.272
I'm grateful to you.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.149
I would never betray you.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.075
You--

25:46.212 --> 25:48.168
Hello, Miss Henning?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.957
Miss Henning?

25:55.722 --> 25:57.633
I'll take the back.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.734
Miss Henning, FBI.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.369
Miss Henning?

26:43.019 --> 26:44.725
Keen!

27:00.203 --> 27:01.283
It's gonna be okay.

27:01.496 --> 27:02.827
It's gonna be okay.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.827
Think.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.680
-Ressler get a visual from the witness?
-No. She's still unconscious.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.932
Been screening service providers,
therapists, lawyers, doctors...

28:11.148 --> 28:13.230
...anyone who's worked with the wives
of our victims.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.524
-Someone connecting the women.
-I got nothing.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.569
Then I took a look at Whitehaven's
employees and volunteers.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.193
At one time or another,
victims' wives reached out...

28:21.409 --> 28:23.115
...to one of Whitehaven's affiliates.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.909
Legal, medical, financial,
how he's finding his victims.

28:26.122 --> 28:29.034
All but one. Their husbands
were murdered by the copycat...

28:29.250 --> 28:30.911
...after they sought help,

28:31.127 --> 28:34.290
Except her. Tracy Solobotkin.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.791
Her husband was the first victim
of our copycat...

28:37.008 --> 28:39.624
...and she was hired over three months
after his death.

28:39.844 --> 28:41.800
Why after?
Her problem was already solved.

28:42.013 --> 28:44.846
She wanted to help women
who were still in bad relationships.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.844
-Wanted to help other women end them.
-Works in Accounting.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.018
Gives her access to the names
of every woman who got assistance.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.440
Perfect opportunity
to identify violent spouses.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.480
-Target-rich environment.
-I'm on my way.

28:55.693 --> 28:58.150
Get a BOLO out on all vehicles
registered to Tracy.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.695
We got a code nine. Deploy
every available unit to her address.

29:01.908 --> 29:04.194
I don't want to do this, but I have to.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.651
Nobody can connect me to Mary
butyou.

29:06.871 --> 29:10.705
ME won't buy it. Victimology's all wrong.
The Deer Hunter killed men.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.324
Is that what you call them? Men?

29:13.753 --> 29:16.369
This wasn't supposed to happen
this way.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.630
I didn't want to hurt Mary
or anybody else.

29:19.842 --> 29:20.957
Anybody but them.

29:22.136 --> 29:23.251
I understand.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.258
-Maybe a jury will.
-That's what I said.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.094
To the Deer Hunter, the real one.

29:30.311 --> 29:31.801
He was my husband.

29:33.272 --> 29:37.060
My God. His father was a bastard.

29:37.777 --> 29:41.645
Pushing him, pushing him,
picking on him, cutting him down.

29:41.864 --> 29:45.982
He didn't want to face what he was,
so he overcompensated.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.242
Always pretending.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.491
Macho, tough.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.950
Trying too hard with the ladies,
but I knew.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.628
After we got married, there's--
There's nothing that can hide that.

30:01.509 --> 30:05.843
You'd think that after his father died,
that he'd come to grips with it.

30:06.597 --> 30:10.465
He got angry, mean, isolated.

30:10.685 --> 30:13.802
Every weekend on hunting trips.
That's what he called them.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.307
You had no idea.

30:17.608 --> 30:21.476
After the separation,
I was staying at my sister's.

30:21.696 --> 30:24.153
I came by the house one night
to get my things.

30:24.365 --> 30:26.981
I thought he was gone,
but he was in here, in the garage.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.613
He had blood on his mouth,
on his clothes.

30:30.621 --> 30:35.581
The Deer Hunter had been
all over the news.

30:35.960 --> 30:40.795
So in that moment,
I knew what he'd done.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.589
And I tried to leave, but....

30:44.260 --> 30:45.545
But he came towards me.

30:46.554 --> 30:49.011
He knew I knew
so he couldn't let me go.

30:49.974 --> 30:52.215
And I'd never held a weapon.

30:54.770 --> 30:58.058
I'd fended him off with a knife before,
but that?

30:58.274 --> 30:59.389
I never held a bow.

30:59.608 --> 31:02.771
Before I knew it, the arrow
went straight through his heart.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.117
You could continue.

31:11.412 --> 31:12.492
You could....

31:12.705 --> 31:14.070
Well, yeah.

31:14.290 --> 31:17.828
All those women Whitehaven had helped,
just like me.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.915
I could give them their lives back
by becoming him.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.918
And it's not easy. It's hard work.

31:25.134 --> 31:28.592
It's filthy work, but it's worth it.

31:30.473 --> 31:33.931
Just to he-- Just to see them scared
for a change...

31:34.143 --> 31:37.431
...to hear them whimper and....

31:37.813 --> 31:40.555
And-- And beg.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.770
All the things after--

31:44.153 --> 31:46.769
You know, with the cutting, the mess,
I hated it.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.196
But I didn't have a choice.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.153
I'm sick.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.201
I know.

31:54.622 --> 31:58.456
Disgusting.
But that's the way Ron did it.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.667
So I have no choice.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.165
Even from beyond the grave...

32:04.381 --> 32:06.508
...he still pulls the strings.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.837
Okay.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.007
You gotta do what you gotta do.

32:13.182 --> 32:16.800
But can you please,
please just do me one favor?

32:17.645 --> 32:21.263
-Yes?
-Shut the hell up and get it over with.

32:22.024 --> 32:24.686
What? You think I don't know
why you're really doing this?

32:24.902 --> 32:27.018
You think I'm buying
this whole "justice for victims" crap?

32:27.530 --> 32:28.940
Well, it's true.

32:29.573 --> 32:32.406
-You're just like your husband.
-I'm nothing like my husband.

32:32.618 --> 32:36.406
You're exactly like him. Like all the sick,
psychopathic animals we lock up.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.954
Oh, you haven't heard a word
that I've been saying.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.827
I've heard every word.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.250
"I could give them back their lives."

32:43.796 --> 32:47.209
Why don't you just admit it?
You get off on killing people.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.915
It doesn't matter if the victim's
a scumbag or a saint.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.468
You get offjust the same,
just like your husband.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.110
Tom, no! Let me go!

33:17.788 --> 33:20.370
Keen! Keen! Stop.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.323
Keen, don't.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.726
Dispatch, we ’re approaching
the vehicle at....

33:42.938 --> 33:46.305
-You okay?
-Yeah. Fine.

33:47.735 --> 33:49.691
Back there....

33:52.114 --> 33:53.149
I can't do this.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.231
Maybe you need some time,
a couple weeks.

33:56.452 --> 33:59.194
-When's the last time you took a vacation?
-You're kidding, right?

34:00.998 --> 34:03.034
I'd have killed her
if you hadn't shown up.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.456
You would have done
what you had to do to survive.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.284
-Same as on the boat.
-That was different. That was Tom.

34:07.504 --> 34:09.460
-You tried to stop him.
-But I didn't.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.252
I hesitated.

34:12.468 --> 34:15.801
Maybe I thought for one second
it'd be better for me if he were dead.

34:16.013 --> 34:19.346
-Liz--
-No. That man had a family.

34:20.601 --> 34:21.636
He had a life.

34:24.605 --> 34:27.017
I'm gonna go to Wilcox.

34:27.274 --> 34:31.267
-I'm gonna tell him everything.
-How many people are alive today...

34:31.487 --> 34:34.103
...that wouldn't be
if it wasn't for the work that we do?

34:34.323 --> 34:36.279
-Please.
-Fifty, a hundred? How many, Liz?

34:36.492 --> 34:40.952
How many families haven't buried
a mother, a father, brother, sister?

34:41.288 --> 34:43.074
-Children?
-That doesn't make it right.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.372
No. It's never gonna be right.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.700
See, the only question
is the body count.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.753
So you go ahead
and you nail yourself to a cross.

34:51.173 --> 34:54.586
While you're feeling sanctified, consider
how many people are gonna die...

34:54.760 --> 34:56.751
...because this task force
gets shut down...

34:57.179 --> 35:00.387
...and those animals on Reddington's
list are still out there feeding.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.055
-Ressler—-
-No. Don't.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.475
Don't ask me to feel your pain, Liz.

35:04.687 --> 35:06.848
I got more than enough of my own.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.936
Do you, Samuel Aleko,
swear under penalty of perjury...

35:15.155 --> 35:19.114
-...that the following is true and correct?
-Yeah.

35:20.536 --> 35:23.198
Please tell the US. Attorney
exactly what you told me...

35:23.414 --> 35:26.872
...about agent Elizabeth Keen's
involvement in the murder...

35:27.084 --> 35:29.917
...of DO harbormaster Eugene Ames.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.838
Mr. Aleko?

35:43.309 --> 35:46.221
Let me remind you, you're under oath.

35:47.438 --> 35:48.644
I don't remember.

35:56.655 --> 36:00.648
You confessed
that Agent Keen was present...

36:00.868 --> 36:03.359
...when the harbormaster was killed...

36:03.579 --> 36:07.993
...and that she deliberately covered up
his death.

36:10.336 --> 36:14.750
That's what you want me to say.
That's not how it was.

36:18.052 --> 36:21.715
Dembe. Yes. Mr. Reddington said
I should call as soon as I traced the call.

36:22.639 --> 36:23.799
Yes, I have an address.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.933
3130 Sheridan Road, Park Slope.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.429
I figured it out.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.559
-What?
-What you're doing.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.485
The hairline.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.686
Guys don't get it.
Most women don't care if men go bald.

36:39.281 --> 36:40.521
N0. Did you think |--?

36:40.741 --> 36:43.153
-You're sexy no matter what.
-I'm not going bald.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.405
|just—- I have a high hairline.
Wait, what?

36:45.621 --> 36:46.906
Did you just say that--?

36:47.122 --> 36:48.623
Yep.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.623
Just don't get fat.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.158
Do you have a phone?

38:02.906 --> 38:04.862
Spare change?

38:06.285 --> 38:08.947
-There you go.
-God bless you, sir. Thanks.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.161
Hey.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.120
Gonna be a freeze tonight.

38:17.379 --> 38:20.246
There's a place about two blocks up
called the Grant.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.377
Give this to the guy in the cage.
Ronnie.

38:22.593 --> 38:24.879
-He'|l cut you a rate.
-Thank you, officer.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.131
Go get a shower.
Get yourself cleaned up.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.928
For sure.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.858
-You all right?
-Yeah. Fine.

38:43.197 --> 38:47.406
What were you thinking running after
a killer alone without backup?

38:47.618 --> 38:49.324
-Are you scolding me?
-Yes.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.619
Yes, I'm scolding you.
That was foolish. You could've been--

38:52.831 --> 38:55.789
-Ki||ed.
-Exactly that. Killed.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.585
What are you gonna do? Ground me?
Take away my phone privileges?

39:07.679 --> 39:09.385
You were right about the Deer Hunter.

39:09.598 --> 39:11.179
-He was a man.
-And a woman.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.508
We were both half right.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.551
Together, we were right.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.364
I have the Fulcrum.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.610
Tell me what it is,
and I'll tell you where to find it.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.118
I've already told you what I can.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.787
To elaborate would place you
in grave danger.

39:40.003 --> 39:42.210
-I don't need your protection.
-I think you do.

39:42.422 --> 39:45.084
If it weren't for me,
you would have been indicted today.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.007
As it is, you needn't worry
about the harbormaster anymore.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.335
What did you do?

39:49.555 --> 39:52.046
Nobody was hurt,
if that's what you're concerned about.

39:52.516 --> 39:54.552
In fact,
a young man's life was saved.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.759
I don't wanna hear any more.
I'm leaving.

39:56.979 --> 40:00.813
I believe I know the real reason
you don't want me to have the Fulcrum.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.022
That is?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.810
Because you're afraid...

40:06.697 --> 40:10.815
...that once you give it to me,
you'll be of no further use to me...

40:11.159 --> 40:13.445
...and you'll never see me again.
