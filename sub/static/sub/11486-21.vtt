00:12.120 --> 00:13.712
Jake, use your spoon.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.911
Can't. I'll die.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.154
If you don't turn off that music,
you'll die anyway.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.597
Fine.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.632
That's better.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.629
He's still gonna be living here
when he's, like, 30.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.559
My big fear is he'll still be
in fifth grade.

00:39.760 --> 00:43.992
Hello, anybody home?
Grandmommy's here.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.790
There's my grandson.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.353
So, Mom, to what do we owe
this unexpected...

01:25.560 --> 01:27.755
- Pleasure?
- No, that's not it.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.396
I was showing a house, and
I thought I'd visit the people I love.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.153
And they weren't home?

01:45.000 --> 01:48.993
Goody. There's a Tudor on Stone Canyon
that's going on the market soon.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.192
- How do you know?
- Owner dropped dead of a heart attack.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.839
You know what they say, darling.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.673
Today's obituary
is tomorrow's exclusive listing.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.592
Father of five in Westwood.
I'm on fire.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.713
You will be soon.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.633
Mom, you're not setting
a very good example here.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.478
Why?

02:10.639 --> 02:14.315
Jake, honey, your grandmommy performs
a very important public service.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.988
When people die,
their families are very, very sad...

02:17.160 --> 02:19.549
...and they have no idea
what their homes are worth.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.594
And you tell them?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.472
Oh, you are so cute.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.353
And Grandmommy doesn't just
prey on the dead, Jake.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.069
She also profits from the pain of divorce
and the humiliation of bankruptcy.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.519
Not to mention she's working on an
alternative fuel made from puppies.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.274
Oh, my God. Harry Gorsky died.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.198
Oh, no. Are you sure it's him?

02:43.400 --> 02:46.437
How many Harry Luther Gorskys
are there in Los Angeles?

02:46.640 --> 02:49.393
- Well, there's one less now.
- Who are you talking about?

02:49.600 --> 02:52.034
He was Uncle Charlie's
and my stepdad.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.879
- The first of three, and not my favorite.
- I liked him.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.833
Oh, please. You were 6.
You still liked Mom.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.112
- Mom, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.236
He was a good man...

03:05.400 --> 03:08.551
...and part of my life,
and now he's gone.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.676
I just pray he died peacefully...

03:10.880 --> 03:13.917
...and held on to that stately
six-bedroom, four-bath Colonial...

03:14.080 --> 03:16.071
...in Hancock Park...

03:17.120 --> 03:20.795
...with the bonus office/guest room
over the garage.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.234
Let me get this straight.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.994
First there was your dad,
then this guy Harry who died...

03:32.160 --> 03:34.230
...then the fat guy
with the carpet business.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.557
No, no, no. The fat guy came after
the twitchy gay guy from Texas...

03:37.720 --> 03:40.553
...who gave us crew cuts
and called us buckaroos.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.034
So out of the three...

03:42.200 --> 03:44.714
...Harry was the best.
- I liked the fat guy, remember?

03:44.880 --> 03:47.030
With the chubby daughter
who was so grateful?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.796
All you had to do was knock on her door
with some Turkish Taffy.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.438
Be that as it may,
he was still a very good father to us.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.232
Oh, please. He was a little tyrant.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.152
"Sit up straight."
"Do your homework."

03:59.320 --> 04:02.073
"Quit forging my signature
on hotel bills."

04:02.640 --> 04:04.358
Okay, then. The funeral is tomorrow.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.717
I think it would be appropriate for us all
to go and pay our respects.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.797
I don't know.
Tomorrow's not good for me.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.276
Oh, Charlie. The man was your father.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.913
No, he was not.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.036
Why do you care so much?
You divorced him.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.516
Just because you divorce doesn't mean
you no longer have feelings.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.790
That's true.
Judith still has feelings for me.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.839
Pity is not really a feeling, Alan.

04:28.400 --> 04:33.428
Regardless of our feelings, we'll still go
and say our final goodbyes to Harry.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.711
- I'm not going.
- Me neither.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.316
- Fine, you stay here with Uncle Charlie.
- Cool.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.958
Yeah, cool.
Why do you wanna go?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.754
I think it's the right thing to do,
and I liked Harry.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.791
- And he liked you.
- I know.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.757
We've stayed in touch over the years.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.552
What?

04:52.520 --> 04:56.479
You betrayed me by communicating with
that son of a bitch after I divorced him?

04:57.360 --> 04:58.952
Well, wait a minute.
You said that...

04:59.160 --> 05:00.513
I know what I said.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.469
I was just being polite because
the guy's worm chow.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.793
All I did was send him Christmas cards
and a picture of Jake.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.391
- You never send me a picture of Jake.
- He's right here.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.716
When was the last time
I got a Christmas card?

05:14.920 --> 05:17.992
Wait, I'm on your side.
Charlie's the one who doesn't wanna go.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.510
I don't even know if I want
you to come now. You've ruined it.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.437
- How can you ruin a funeral?
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.995
- Where are you going?
- I need something black.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.111
Doesn't your soul qualify?

05:32.280 --> 05:36.990
Laugh now, but when I die,
I will be coming back to haunt you.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.598
How will that be any different
than this?

05:46.520 --> 05:49.193
Okay, Jake.
I'm going to pick up your grandmother.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.958
Okay.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.870
You think maybe
you've played that enough?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.229
Okay.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.480
I might as well just buy him
a crack pipe.

05:58.760 --> 06:00.637
Hey!

06:01.160 --> 06:03.913
- Let's get this over with.
- You're coming to the funeral?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.152
I thought about it and realized,
even if I didn't like the guy...

06:07.320 --> 06:09.788
...that shouldn't stop me from
going to his funeral...

06:09.960 --> 06:11.951
...and, you know, taking a victory lap.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.151
Charlie, you're not
gonna wanna hear this...

06:14.320 --> 06:16.117
...but you sound a lot like Mom.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.474
Tread lightly.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.315
- Jake, you're coming with us.
- I don't wanna.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.033
You get to see a real dead guy.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.198
There's gonna be a dead guy? Where?

06:27.800 --> 06:31.554
- At the funeral.
- Oh, cool. Can I come?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.676
Did I say he was gonna
live here until 30?

06:34.840 --> 06:36.114
I meant forever.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.712
What are you talking about?

06:41.680 --> 06:44.558
- Go put on your nice clothes.
- Okay.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.438
He doesn't know
what nice clothes are.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.192
- Jake?
- Oh, right.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.471
Isn't it a little early to start drinking?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.513
- Would you like a snort?
- That's what I meant.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.759
Thanks.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.353
You okay, Mom?

07:14.520 --> 07:16.715
I just can't believe he's gone.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.310
Isn't that why we're going
to the funeral? To make sure?

07:20.960 --> 07:25.397
I'm confused. If you cared for Harry
so much, how come you left him?

07:25.680 --> 07:28.513
Yes, well, about that.

07:29.920 --> 07:34.311
I may have glossed over the details
with you boys just a skosh.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.640
I didn't actually leave Harry
so much as he left me.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.549
- You're kidding.
- He met a younger woman...

07:42.720 --> 07:45.553
...and just traded me in.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.870
You still loved him, didn't you?

07:49.520 --> 07:51.875
I loved him very much.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.869
Oh, Harry. My sweet, dear Harry.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.395
All right. Level eight.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.671
So where's the dead guy?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.037
Jake, show a little respect.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.556
Where's the dead guy, sir?

08:18.360 --> 08:20.635
In the chapel. Now keep it down.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.229
I think I can smell him.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.515
Oh, Lord. There she is.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.717
- Who?
- The tramp who stole my husband.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.517
Not bad.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.275
Not good.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.912
I'm gonna go mourn.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.553
- Yeah, me too.
- Stay put. Mommy needs you.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.320
- Hello, Evelyn.
- Hello, Christine.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.950
- This is my son, Alan.
- Hello.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.754
And who's this little guy?
Your grandson?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.349
I'm just here to see the dead guy.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.789
Yes, I've been blessed with
both children and grandchildren.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.235
How about you? Oh, wait, I remember.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.789
You were slightly less fertile
than a sand trap.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.551
We're very sorry for your loss.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.594
It's not my loss.
He left me for that tramp over there.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.676
She doesn't look very unhappy,
does she?

09:16.880 --> 09:19.872
She just met him. Wait a week.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.318
I think it's the responsibility of we,
the living, to carry on...

09:28.480 --> 09:31.074
...to live life to the fullest.
Embrace it.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.595
Kiss it on the mouth, if you will.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.634
Excuse me, Charlie,
can I talk to you for a minute?

09:36.800 --> 09:39.109
Sure. Heather,
this is my brother, Alan.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.397
He lives with me
at my beach house in Malibu.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.837
- Hi.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.951
- Thank you.
- Alan came to live with me...

09:47.120 --> 09:51.750
...at my Malibu beach house
when he lost his wife.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.353
It's a healing house.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.435
My wife isn't really dead.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.035
Because you healed.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.473
At my Malibu beach house.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.113
And when you think about it,
Harry isn't really dead either.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.149
He lives right here...

10:13.320 --> 10:14.594
...in all of us.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.756
- Thank you.
- Good. Let go.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.990
It's good to let go.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.878
Charlie.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.950
Excuse me a moment.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.754
What, what, what, what, what?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.598
What do you mean,
"What, what, what"?

10:31.760 --> 10:34.991
- You're hitting on the widow.
- No, I'm consoling the widow.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.355
I won't hit on her
until they close the lid.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.071
Unbelievable.
How do you sleep at night?

10:40.280 --> 10:42.999
Usually drunk and on top of somebody.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.919
But that takes work, Alan.
Doesn't just happen by itself.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.233
Here's an idea. Why don't you run
to the embalming room...

10:49.400 --> 10:52.233
...and see if you can score a couple
fresh ones off the truck?

10:52.440 --> 10:54.556
Excuse me,
but considering your ex-wife...

10:54.720 --> 10:58.713
...I'd say you're the expert on having sex
with cold women who don't move.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.555
Nevertheless, you can
hit on women anywhere.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.517
Why did you bother to come?

11:06.240 --> 11:07.673
I don't know. I just did.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.599
- That's it? No reason?
- Do you have a reason for everything?

11:10.760 --> 11:12.955
- Yes.
- So how's that working out for you?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.917
I know how difficult it must be...

11:16.080 --> 11:20.517
...rambling around all by yourself in that
big, drafty, six-bedroom Colonial...

11:20.720 --> 11:23.314
...with the guest room/office
over the garage.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.715
Harry gave me a potbellied pig.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.433
So you'd remember him, sure.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.160
But I know Harry would want you
to move on...

11:30.320 --> 11:32.629
...and this is the perfect time
to move on...

11:32.840 --> 11:35.274
...because this is a seller's market.
- Excuse me.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.839
Can we talk to you a minute?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.197
Pardon me, dear.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.876
What? I'm working here.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.913
That woman just lost her husband.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.396
Alan, the man was 50 years old
when she was born.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.916
- So?
- So she had to see it coming.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.072
Even for you, that is really cold.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.748
Oh, Mr. Graveside Nookie weighs in.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.151
You were trying to give the widow
a sympathetic crotch to cry on.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.039
Hey, watch your mouth.
This is a solemn event.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.639
Yeah, show a little class.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.150
Me? I'm the only one here
behaving appropriately.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.594
Hey, where's Jake?

12:26.320 --> 12:29.756
- Jake.
- How do you know my name?

12:31.360 --> 12:33.112
- It's okay.
- Okay?

12:33.280 --> 12:36.033
I almost pooped my pants.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.878
What are you doing?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.271
I just wanted to see.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.591
Okay, well, let's... Let's take a look.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.395
- Really?
- Yeah. Come on.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.478
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.791
- How did he die?
- He just got old.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.837
His heart stopped.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.435
His watch is still going.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.191
- Yep.
- Why would he need a watch, anyway?

13:13.360 --> 13:16.079
It's not like he's gonna be
late for anything.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.672
Okay, there are other people waiting
to pay their respects.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.910
Why don't we go find Grandma?

13:26.800 --> 13:29.268
I don't care what anybody says.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.478
I always thought you were a good guy.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.200
Thanks, Alan.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.114
Want to know what time it is?

13:43.480 --> 13:44.469
Let's go.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.954
- How's he look?
- Dead.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.917
Cool.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.317
Surprise.

14:06.080 --> 14:09.834
Listen, I just wanted to tell you
that I've been thinking about it...

14:10.000 --> 14:13.515
...and maybe some of the stuff
between us may have been my fault.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.955
I was angry about losing my dad,
and I guess...

14:16.120 --> 14:18.395
...you were the guy I took it out on.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.433
Anyway, not that it makes
a lot of difference at this point...

14:21.600 --> 14:26.469
...but I just wanted you to know
that I'm sorry.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.833
By the way, I'm gonna take a shot
at your wife.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.431
But that's just a guy thing.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.273
Nothing personal, okay?

14:45.800 --> 14:48.030
I'll take that as a yes.

14:50.120 --> 14:54.193
And so with every door that God closes,
he opens a window.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.913
Did he say "window" or "widow"?

14:59.240 --> 15:02.676
Even as we say goodbye
to our beloved friend...

15:02.840 --> 15:04.432
...Harry Luther Gorsky...

15:04.600 --> 15:07.319
...we know that he lives on
in all of us.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.119
- How are you holding up?
- Okay.

15:10.280 --> 15:15.673
- Lf you need anything, I'm right here.
- Thank you. That's very comforting.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.518
For everything, there is a season.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.188
A time to be born, a time to die.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.397
A time to reap, a time to sow.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.232
So...

15:30.040 --> 15:31.996
...I would like to invite anyone...

15:32.160 --> 15:34.435
...who wishes to say a few words
about Harry...

15:34.600 --> 15:36.113
...to come up and share with us.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.672
As always, I'll do him first.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.799
- Mom, bad idea.
- Hey...

15:45.000 --> 15:49.437
...if I didn't give in to bad ideas,
you wouldn't be here. Hold this.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.636
Dad. I can't find my Gameboy.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.876
Not now, Jake.

15:58.120 --> 16:02.079
Hello. Welcome to Harry's funeral.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.592
I haven't seen him so drained
of bodily fluids since our honeymoon.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.559
What? I thought I'd open with a joke.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.069
My name is Evelyn Harper...

16:17.240 --> 16:22.678
...or, as dear Harry used to call me,
his sweet little sugar tushy.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.471
When I first met Harry...

16:27.640 --> 16:31.553
...I was just a hot young widow
with bills to pay...

16:31.720 --> 16:34.188
...who could lick the chrome
off a trailer hitch.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.153
I also had two small boys...

16:38.360 --> 16:42.592
...one of whom Harry cared for
very deeply.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.955
The other one was Charlie.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.277
It wasn't easy being
a substitute father...

16:49.440 --> 16:52.876
...but Harry gave it his all.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.151
Unfortunately, it wasn't enough...

16:55.320 --> 16:57.914
...which is probably why
he looked for solace...

16:58.080 --> 16:59.832
...in the arms of a cheap slut.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.797
Stand up, Christine.
Let everybody have a look at you.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.673
Take a good look, Heather.
That's gonna be you someday.

17:17.720 --> 17:22.156
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being disrespectful
to the grieving widow.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.517
But, listen, you wanna talk grieving?
I'm grieving.

17:25.680 --> 17:30.071
I loved this man with all my heart,
and you left me, you lousy bastard.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.113
Well, take a good look.
I've still got a great ass...

17:33.280 --> 17:35.748
...and yours is decomposing
as we speak.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.752
Thank you.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.998
- Okay. That was beautiful.
- Time to go.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.395
I'll call you.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.593
- Dad, what about my Gameboy?
- Forget it. Just keep walking.

17:51.600 --> 17:57.675
And so let's take a moment
of silent prayer for our friend, Harry.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.873
I am really, really sorry.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.278
Got it.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.358
It's my kid's. I don't know,
maybe I spoil him.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.430
Okay, bye.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.353
Boys, when I die...

18:50.520 --> 18:53.080
...I want a simple funeral.
No tears.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.037
- Done.
- You got it.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.435
And I wanna be buried
next to your father.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.194
Dad was cremated, Mom.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.991
Oh, yes, right.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.435
I was thinking of someone else.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.433
So I take it you'd rather be
buried than cremated?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.995
Oh, can't we do both?

19:12.320 --> 19:15.596
I want to be buried
on the side of a hill...

19:15.800 --> 19:19.190
...nestled amongst the willows,
overlooking the ocean.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.596
Do we get to pick the ocean?

19:22.560 --> 19:26.678
And I want an unadorned headstone,
which reads simply:

19:26.880 --> 19:31.078
"Evelyn Harper.
Loving wife, devoted mother."

19:31.280 --> 19:33.999
That's good. Open with a joke.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.631
