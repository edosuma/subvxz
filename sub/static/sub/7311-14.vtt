WEBVTT

00:27.867 --> 00:28.880
Oh, no...

00:35.801 --> 00:36.847
Oh, my God...

00:42.259 --> 00:43.264
What the hell?

00:48.408 --> 00:49.438
Anyone there?

01:00.179 --> 01:01.179
What?

01:03.533 --> 01:05.169
What the hell's going on here, man?

01:08.694 --> 01:09.988
Where are my keys?

01:27.638 --> 01:28.982
Anyone there?

01:34.767 --> 01:35.838
Hello?!

02:10.594 --> 02:12.359
I already rebooted the system,
Frank,

02:12.589 --> 02:13.782
- twice.
- Four hours.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.845
That is how long
I waited for your cable repairman.

02:15.905 --> 02:17.703
- You've already said it.
- Four hours!

02:17.763 --> 02:20.449
I will not reboot again.
I will never reboot it again!

02:20.530 --> 02:22.536
Reschedule?
So you can waste another Saturday?

02:22.616 --> 02:25.038
Just admit you have no idea
how to fix the problem, and

02:25.118 --> 02:27.087
then we can both get on
with our lives.

02:27.834 --> 02:29.668
Someone will die today.

02:29.870 --> 02:30.919
Morning, team.

02:32.897 --> 02:34.214
- "Morning"?
- "Team"?

02:34.295 --> 02:36.466
You are in a particularly
good mood today, McGee.

02:36.658 --> 02:38.427
Yeah, and I don't like it.
What gives?

02:39.758 --> 02:41.012
I had a good weekend.

02:43.962 --> 02:45.642
I had a very good weekend.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.355
- Golden Girls marathon?
- No, Tony, actually, I met someone.

02:51.072 --> 02:53.097
- What's his name?
- Her name is Claire.

02:53.157 --> 02:54.734
She is a computer programmer.

02:55.030 --> 02:56.080
Where did you meet?

02:56.214 --> 03:00.115
Well, actually, we... we haven't met
yet in person. We met online.

03:00.753 --> 03:02.330
Of course, you did.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.215
Go figure.

03:03.275 --> 03:04.870
So when is the first date?

03:05.165 --> 03:07.998
Hopefully, as soon as possible.
This girl, Ziva, she's perfect.

03:08.197 --> 03:11.666
She's gorgeous, she thinks
I'm hysterical and

03:11.845 --> 03:13.295
she is a level 5 sorceress.

03:13.571 --> 03:15.130
- Oh, God!
- What?

03:15.782 --> 03:16.538
No!

03:16.774 --> 03:19.633
The sadness when I hear you talk
like this. You don't know who these

03:19.714 --> 03:22.807
people are. It could be a 45-year-old
overweight man in Minnesota.

03:22.867 --> 03:25.152
I mean, like you said,
you two haven't even met yet.

03:25.212 --> 03:28.075
What part of "level 5 sorceress"
don't you understand?

03:28.243 --> 03:29.245
All of it.

03:29.678 --> 03:32.564
Boss, to be a level 5 sorceress,
you have to conquer...

03:33.019 --> 03:34.191
- Not important.
- No.

03:34.271 --> 03:36.735
But we got
a missing Navy Captain who is.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.714
Office of Naval Intelligence
called it in.

03:40.463 --> 03:41.614
Where are you going?

03:43.915 --> 03:45.239
Yeah, didn't you say that...

03:45.299 --> 03:47.746
Missing person, DiNozzo.
Hasn't been 48 hours.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.290
So it is not in
our jurisdiction yet.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.207
No.

03:51.471 --> 03:53.779
But you'd like us
to make a few calls.

03:53.839 --> 03:54.956
We certainly would.

03:57.048 --> 03:58.048
Agent Gibbs.

04:00.016 --> 04:01.301
We spoke on the phone.

04:01.405 --> 04:02.705
This is Rebecca.

04:03.153 --> 04:04.503
Captain Jennings' daughter.

04:04.839 --> 04:05.939
And you are?

04:06.220 --> 04:07.566
Kevin Nelson, her fiancé.

04:08.930 --> 04:10.977
- Ex-fiancé.
- This is pointless.

04:11.715 --> 04:12.727
I hope so.

04:13.465 --> 04:16.399
Becky's dad was supposed to meet us
last night for dinner at Mangiamo's,

04:16.480 --> 04:18.777
- but he never showed.
- You know why he never showed.

04:18.837 --> 04:20.166
Becky, please.

04:21.531 --> 04:23.049
They got into a fight yesterday.

04:23.109 --> 04:24.407
Yeah, yesterday and...

04:24.488 --> 04:27.494
the day before yesterday, and...
the day before that.

04:28.592 --> 04:29.592
About?

04:29.743 --> 04:33.333
My father has his ideas about
how I should be living my life.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.207
Most fathers do.

04:36.857 --> 04:38.346
He came by yesterday morning.

04:38.406 --> 04:41.258
We got into a fight,
so now he's trying to prove a point.

04:41.345 --> 04:42.384
By disappearing?

04:42.578 --> 04:44.641
Not answering his cell?
Hell of a point.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.991
Kevin, it's been one day.

04:46.051 --> 04:48.390
And you're ready to call out
the National Guard. Relax.

04:48.683 --> 04:50.254
Becky, maybe you've forgotten:

04:50.362 --> 04:51.392
You're all he has.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.591
Maybe I've forgotten?

04:56.012 --> 04:57.190
Thanks for the coffee.

05:02.151 --> 05:04.322
She does not seem
to share your concern.

05:04.551 --> 05:06.032
Trust me, she's worried.

05:06.553 --> 05:08.231
She's got a funny way of showing it.

05:08.927 --> 05:11.943
You have to understand, she lost her
mother less than a year ago to cancer.

05:12.176 --> 05:14.866
The idea that something
may have happened to her father...

05:14.926 --> 05:17.132
You are a very caring...

05:18.426 --> 05:19.637
ex-fiancé.

05:20.429 --> 05:21.899
She'd do the same for me.

05:28.968 --> 05:32.277
Found a body in Shenandoah. Matches
the description of Captain Jennings.

05:33.723 --> 05:36.813
Was just getting ready to call in our
forensic team when I spotted your BOLO.

05:36.893 --> 05:37.994
Who found the body?

05:38.054 --> 05:39.983
A couple of kids
in one of our warming huts.

05:40.063 --> 05:42.201
- Or as they like to call 'em...
- Love shacks.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.863
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

05:45.308 --> 05:46.677
Get a lot of kids up here.

05:47.345 --> 05:48.786
Oh, to be young again.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.602
Well, it has been a while
since we've had a murder up here.

05:51.827 --> 05:53.445
How do you know it's a murder?

05:53.556 --> 05:55.295
Ain't a suicide.
That's for sure.

06:11.755 --> 06:13.983
Will be hard for Rebecca
to hear her father is dead.

06:15.233 --> 06:16.283
But this...

06:16.765 --> 06:20.200
Reminiscent of a rather dark period
in English history.

06:20.403 --> 06:23.576
Did you know that the preferred
method of punishment for

06:23.657 --> 06:25.494
treason was to be hung,
drawn and quartered.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.914
They would hang
the victims by the neck,

06:29.088 --> 06:31.875
then they were taken
from the scaffold

06:31.935 --> 06:35.379
before they could have the freedom
of death and disemboweled.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.875
Just like this chap.

06:37.217 --> 06:40.468
Except, unlike him, they would hack them
into four "quarters"

06:40.549 --> 06:42.261
and drag them through the streets,

06:42.585 --> 06:44.388
their heads stuck on pikestaffs.

06:45.079 --> 06:46.140
Nice story, Ducky.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.975
Yes, well, I did say it was dark.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.902
And, thankfully, ancient history.

06:51.176 --> 06:52.671
Not so ancient, Duck.

06:54.218 --> 06:55.276
Decent tire track.

06:55.786 --> 06:59.144
I got things under control. Why don't
you head down to the hut, help Gibbs.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.406
Nah, it's a bit small down there.
Wouldn't want things getting cramped.

07:02.595 --> 07:03.797
Right. Got it.

07:04.816 --> 07:05.820
Chicken!

07:08.747 --> 07:09.747
What?

07:09.782 --> 07:10.831
Five years,

07:10.911 --> 07:12.833
you still can't handle
the bloodbaths, can you?

07:12.913 --> 07:14.231
Yeah, that's what it is.

07:14.391 --> 07:16.289
Look, I told you before,
I had a good weekend,

07:16.349 --> 07:18.407
I'm just trying to stay
in the nice head space.

07:19.149 --> 07:19.882
Carla.

07:19.963 --> 07:20.963
Claire.

07:21.497 --> 07:22.497
Whatever.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.544
Enjoy it while it lasts.

07:24.604 --> 07:26.772
Women are trouble.
Haven't you learned anything from me?

07:26.796 --> 07:29.225
Yeah.
Not to go on undercover dates with

07:29.306 --> 07:31.687
a doctor whose father
is the world's biggest arms dealer.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.259
That's low, Probie.

07:34.526 --> 07:37.066
And not to loan your friends money.
You still owe me 40 bucks.

07:37.147 --> 07:39.568
Don't change the subject.
What are you talking about?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.350
I understand what's going on here:
You're jealous.

07:45.410 --> 07:47.540
You haven't had a date in a few weeks.
It's okay.

07:48.412 --> 07:50.538
Me, jealous of the Elf Lord?

07:50.598 --> 07:53.350
I think you have me confused
with someone who's far less awesome.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.171
Level 5 sorceress.

07:58.459 --> 08:01.840
This abdominal mutilation
was done postmortem.

08:02.212 --> 08:04.760
Note the lack of bleeding

08:04.841 --> 08:06.053
along the dermis here,

08:06.363 --> 08:09.776
unlike this wound,
which shows signs of coagulation.

08:10.218 --> 08:12.309
Happened at least one hour prior.

08:12.481 --> 08:15.378
The killer snuck up behind him.
Knocked him unconscious.

08:15.624 --> 08:17.218
Brought him here, killed him.

08:17.278 --> 08:20.866
Well, the lack of defensive wounds
would support that theory.

08:21.219 --> 08:23.696
Ducky, that blood
seems unusually red.

08:24.091 --> 08:26.218
Good eye, Officer David.

08:26.445 --> 08:29.034
Erythema usually suggests

08:29.115 --> 08:31.870
that the blood is saturated
with carboxyhemoglobin.

08:32.653 --> 08:33.722
Carbon monoxide.

08:33.783 --> 08:37.126
Yeah, possibly from the stove
in this confined space.

08:37.419 --> 08:39.253
Perhaps the cause of death,
perhaps not.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.971
And the rest of it?

08:41.216 --> 08:43.549
Well, I think
we can rule out organ harvesting.

08:43.751 --> 08:45.551
Risk of infection is much too high.

08:47.466 --> 08:48.858
Take a look at this.

09:01.063 --> 09:02.183
Oh, boy.

09:05.013 --> 09:06.989
- Problem?
- Waiting for you to find out.

09:07.157 --> 09:10.117
The man had a pentagram on his back.
That does not make him possessed.

09:11.156 --> 09:12.368
Fear the house, Ziva.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.892
Always fear the house.

09:13.952 --> 09:16.675
I will keep my eyes open
for any poltergeists.

09:16.735 --> 09:18.300
Not the ghosts I'm worried about...

09:18.360 --> 09:20.365
it's the pentagram-happy
dungeon-building freaks

09:20.425 --> 09:22.328
that always live
in wholesome places like this.

09:22.388 --> 09:25.182
Then I will keep my eyes open
for any dungeons.

09:25.971 --> 09:27.029
They looked happy.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.386
It is nice when a couple
has so much in common,

09:29.724 --> 09:31.597
like McGee
and his new sorceress friend.

09:32.303 --> 09:33.311
Oh, yeah,

09:33.850 --> 09:35.629
I was going to talk
to you about that.

09:36.036 --> 09:37.731
It's kind of funny, actually.

09:38.864 --> 09:39.864
Let's see.

09:40.552 --> 09:42.553
How do I put this delicately?

09:44.531 --> 09:45.653
She've...

09:47.475 --> 09:49.615
- she's not real?
- You did not.

09:50.082 --> 09:50.783
I did.

09:50.973 --> 09:52.701
I was bored. It was late.

09:52.782 --> 09:54.614
I just watched Weird Science.

09:54.867 --> 09:58.182
Next thing I knew, I was building
a fake online profile and...

09:58.603 --> 09:59.625
I'm in with McGee.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.586
He really likes her.
Tony, you have to tell him.

10:03.076 --> 10:04.079
I know.

10:04.850 --> 10:07.383
It's actually kind of flattering...
in a creepy way.

10:07.569 --> 10:09.635
- What did you think would happen?
- I didn't know.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.143
The flaw in the plan...

10:13.101 --> 10:15.265
was the plan.
But I got another plan to end it.

10:15.345 --> 10:17.893
- Which is?
- You've ever see Fatal Attraction.

10:20.008 --> 10:21.577
Poltergeist is behind me, isn't it?

10:22.251 --> 10:23.277
Can I help you?

10:24.412 --> 10:25.412
NCIS.

10:25.740 --> 10:28.038
- Who are you?
- Adrianna Lopez.

10:29.310 --> 10:32.285
I live here. I clean.
I stay in the guest house.

10:32.661 --> 10:34.201
Did you find Mr. Thomas?

10:40.126 --> 10:41.242
I'm afraid...

10:41.621 --> 10:43.252
Captain Jennings is dead.

10:45.978 --> 10:46.978
How?

10:47.619 --> 10:48.640
He was murdered.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.385
Murdered? Dios mio, por que?

10:51.466 --> 10:52.553
No lo se.

10:53.165 --> 10:54.753
Pero lo vamos a investigar.

10:55.491 --> 10:56.491
Excuse me.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.484
Do you know where that goes?

11:00.678 --> 11:02.646
Mr. Thomas says no one
goes down there.

11:03.820 --> 11:05.157
I don't think he'll mind.

11:05.715 --> 11:06.715
Ziva?

11:12.479 --> 11:14.700
I'm betting satanic dungeon.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.354
Hi, there.

11:23.613 --> 11:25.419
I'm Beary Smyles.

11:25.541 --> 11:28.088
Would you like me
to sing you a song?

11:28.429 --> 11:29.923
Beary frickin' Smyles.

11:30.416 --> 11:33.092
Christmas 1989,
every kid wanted one of these.

11:33.355 --> 11:35.304
- Including you, McGee?
- Oh, yeah.

11:35.624 --> 11:37.306
But Beary was sold out everywhere.

11:37.555 --> 11:38.557
I was crushed.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.184
You were 13.

11:40.423 --> 11:41.423
I was 12.

11:41.528 --> 11:43.573
My parents couldn't find Beary so...

11:44.173 --> 11:46.064
I decided to take
the bull by the horns.

11:46.461 --> 11:47.479
I designed my own.

11:47.539 --> 11:50.359
I used my dad's old tape recorder
and a Winnie the Pooh bear.

11:50.733 --> 11:52.362
Called him "Pooh 2.0".

11:52.604 --> 11:54.990
And 15 short years later,
you lost your virginity.

11:55.260 --> 11:56.700
- DiNozzo?
- Hey, Boss.

11:56.781 --> 11:58.712
I was just telling the guys that...

11:58.772 --> 12:01.044
Captain Jennings' car
was found off Route 19.

12:01.104 --> 12:02.726
It was abandoned.
It's being towed in.

12:03.814 --> 12:05.604
Boss, still working
on the captain's laptop,

12:05.664 --> 12:07.461
but I was able
to access his voicemail.

12:08.221 --> 12:11.173
This little gem was left two days ago
by his daughter, Rebecca.

12:11.419 --> 12:12.547
Hey, Dad, it's Becky.

12:12.607 --> 12:15.999
I thought long and hard about what you
said and I decided that you're right.

12:16.059 --> 12:17.725
I need to pull my life together.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.542
So, from now on, I'm going
to ignore my family,

12:21.752 --> 12:23.733
get what I want
through manipulation,

12:23.793 --> 12:27.106
and I'm gonna leave home for weeks
at the drop of a hat, and that way,

12:27.187 --> 12:28.693
I can be exactly like you.

12:29.295 --> 12:31.150
Okay, see you at dinner tonight.

12:31.983 --> 12:33.104
If you show...

12:33.952 --> 12:36.073
- Daddy's little girl.
- Speaking of Daddy.

12:36.594 --> 12:39.868
Captain Thomas Jennings works
in the counterespionage lab

12:39.949 --> 12:42.008
at the Office of Naval Intelligence.
One of those...

12:42.068 --> 12:44.642
brainiacs, you know,
who designs all their nifty whiz bangs.

12:44.702 --> 12:45.714
"Whiz bangs?"

12:46.438 --> 12:47.799
Whiz bangs, you know.

12:47.859 --> 12:49.670
Sort of like Q in the Bond films.

12:49.751 --> 12:51.007
Come on, DiNozzo.

12:53.047 --> 12:55.884
For the last two years,
despite losing his wife to cancer,

12:55.965 --> 12:59.156
Captain Jennings has been working
18 hours a day, seven days a week

12:59.216 --> 13:01.012
that is, when he's actually in town.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.766
Jennings' Naval travel logs
show that

13:02.847 --> 13:05.025
he departed on international flights
once a month.

13:05.085 --> 13:09.025
However, according to arrival logs,
he never made it to his destinations.

13:09.299 --> 13:11.066
Which begs the question.

13:11.383 --> 13:12.510
Where'd he really go?

13:13.901 --> 13:14.903
Scalpel.

13:18.965 --> 13:19.967
Hemostats.

13:22.836 --> 13:23.837
Screwdriver.

13:26.924 --> 13:28.375
Thank you, Gibbs, RN.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.362
Come to play doctor? Caf-POW!

13:32.741 --> 13:33.881
What do you got, Abbs?

13:34.991 --> 13:37.676
1989's Christmas nightmare
for every parent.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.595
The unattainable...

13:39.822 --> 13:40.846
Beary Smyles.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.389
My dad waited in line

13:42.470 --> 13:44.641
two hours for one on Black Friday.

13:44.885 --> 13:45.885
Six...

13:47.050 --> 13:48.395
Christmas Eve...

13:51.311 --> 13:53.775
You notice the factory seals
are broken. So...

13:53.856 --> 13:55.077
Somebody's been inside.

13:55.137 --> 13:58.697
Yep, and after Dr. Abby finishes
her exploratory surgery,

13:58.777 --> 13:59.823
she'll tell us why.

14:00.114 --> 14:01.114
Tire tracks.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.035
A man on a mission. I like it.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.383
Unfortunately, I'm still working

14:05.443 --> 14:07.748
on finding the exact make
and model of said tires.

14:07.939 --> 14:09.291
- And the...
- Pentagram.

14:10.728 --> 14:11.939
It's not what you think.

14:11.999 --> 14:15.589
Contrary to popular belief,
a satanic pentagram

14:15.670 --> 14:17.007
has an elongated point.

14:17.203 --> 14:19.176
This pentagram is
geometrically perfect.

14:19.773 --> 14:22.675
Historically, pentagrams have been used
to symbolize all kinds of things.

14:22.735 --> 14:24.474
- How about this one?
- Good question.

14:24.534 --> 14:25.960
I'm still working on it.

14:26.395 --> 14:29.072
- So, basically, you've got nothing.
- I've spoiled you, Gibbs.

14:29.132 --> 14:31.952
You can't get an answer every time
you come down here, but next time

14:32.222 --> 14:34.542
- I will have something.
- Next time you'll have a Caf-POW!

14:36.906 --> 14:38.988
Oh, Captain, Captain...

14:39.459 --> 14:43.157
disembowelment,
blunt-force trauma and a pentagram.

14:43.217 --> 14:46.078
You, my friend,
are as mysterious as they come.

14:46.158 --> 14:48.121
I was hoping
you'd already figured him out, Duck.

14:48.633 --> 14:51.374
Well, the captain was
in good physical condition.

14:51.601 --> 14:53.959
No sign of arteriosclerosis

14:54.019 --> 14:55.795
or any other degenerative disease.

14:56.091 --> 14:59.365
However, in the lining
of his duodenum,

14:59.425 --> 15:02.010
I found traces
of green discoloration,

15:02.407 --> 15:05.879
possibly a reaction
to a tetracycline-based antibiotic.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.182
You got a cause of death?

15:07.433 --> 15:11.393
The captain's skull showed
additional signs of blunt-force trauma.

15:11.665 --> 15:14.972
At first glance I thought
that might be the cause of death.

15:15.032 --> 15:16.277
How about second glance?

15:16.337 --> 15:19.653
Well, as usual, it proved to be
more reliable than the first.

15:20.402 --> 15:21.697
Abby's tox screen

15:22.255 --> 15:24.491
confirmed
that the captain was exposed

15:24.572 --> 15:26.493
to carbon monoxide at levels

15:26.573 --> 15:28.829
that would almost
certainly have proved fatal.

15:29.523 --> 15:30.839
Well, CO killed him.

15:31.133 --> 15:32.742
Carving the turkey came later.

15:32.910 --> 15:35.891
Yes, and half an hour after

15:36.112 --> 15:39.006
the pentagram was imprinted
on his back.

15:39.220 --> 15:42.466
You know, I don't believe
this is the work of satanists.

15:42.785 --> 15:45.474
Really? You been chatting with Abby,
have you, Duck?

15:45.534 --> 15:48.624
Well, although these wounds may appear
to be random, they're not.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.225
I found a pattern.

15:51.161 --> 15:53.610
Whoever sliced Captain Jennings open

15:53.789 --> 15:55.814
wasn't trying
to kill or torture him.

15:56.659 --> 15:58.541
They were looking for something.

16:08.641 --> 16:10.968
Hi, there. I'm Beary Smyles.

16:11.441 --> 16:13.276
You're my best friend, McGee.

16:14.196 --> 16:15.326
Thank you, Beary.

16:16.447 --> 16:17.623
You're very welcome.

16:17.683 --> 16:21.103
All right, one more time and I'm gonna
rip that bear's head off again!

16:22.268 --> 16:23.481
Gear up, DiNozzo.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.483
Got a body at Quantico.

16:25.563 --> 16:28.568
- Don't mess with me.
- That bear sounds very familiar.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.071
You think, David?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.198
DiNozzo, bag and tag.

16:33.065 --> 16:35.284
David, witness statements.

16:35.632 --> 16:36.701
McGee,

16:36.782 --> 16:39.516
I ever tell you
how brilliant you are?

16:40.197 --> 16:41.197
Oh, Beary.

16:42.074 --> 16:43.291
I love you, McGee.

16:47.326 --> 16:48.381
Sorry, boss.

16:48.649 --> 16:49.649
Talk to me.

16:50.671 --> 16:51.873
You, McGee.

16:53.706 --> 16:56.694
Well, we... know why Captain Jennings
was playing with dolls.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.808
He was using the primitive
electronics in Beary

16:58.889 --> 17:00.593
here to build
an old-school "phreak box".

17:00.653 --> 17:02.576
- In English.
- A phreak box.

17:02.637 --> 17:04.762
That's a tool that hackers
used to use in the '80s

17:04.823 --> 17:07.656
to communicate remotely
with computer systems.

17:10.076 --> 17:11.076
What?

17:11.326 --> 17:14.367
Come on, guys.
War Games, Sneakers, Hackers?

17:14.768 --> 17:16.483
Very young Angelina Jolie in that.

17:17.364 --> 17:19.778
Why did Jennings use
a child's toy to build one?

17:19.838 --> 17:22.289
Well, my guess is,
that the technology in Beary is so old,

17:22.368 --> 17:24.818
modern systems aren't designed
to defend against it.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.608
- He's using it to hack something.
- What?

17:26.669 --> 17:28.378
I'm not sure what he's specifically

17:28.460 --> 17:30.589
after yet, but I do know
who he's targeting.

17:30.670 --> 17:33.884
The IP addresses are assigned
to Homeland Security's mainframe.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.389
We also found a series of encrypted
e-mails on Jennings' laptop.

17:38.469 --> 17:40.641
Can't read them.
And we don't know their destination.

17:40.722 --> 17:41.780
But get this:

17:41.840 --> 17:45.414
Every time Jennings goes on
one of his "overseas business trips",

17:45.474 --> 17:46.656
the e-mails stop.

17:46.716 --> 17:49.023
- He's meeting his contact.
- Contact for what?

17:49.155 --> 17:52.093
He's hacking into Homeland Security.
He's flying all over the country.

17:52.153 --> 17:54.488
- Doubt they're playing Parcheesi.
- DiNozzo, David...

17:54.703 --> 17:56.532
Talk to Jennings' boss.
On it, Boss.

17:58.265 --> 18:00.184
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Now I've got something for you.

18:00.244 --> 18:01.620
Great, be right there, Abs.

18:06.997 --> 18:07.997
So,

18:08.082 --> 18:10.588
how's it going
with your other special friend?

18:11.167 --> 18:12.168
Claire...

18:12.447 --> 18:13.799
she's gotten a bit clingy.

18:14.552 --> 18:17.144
I didn't respond to an e-mail of hers
right away, and she freaked out.

18:17.168 --> 18:20.932
Starts going on about how computers
are destroying civilization,

18:21.103 --> 18:23.384
which is really weird
because she's a computer programmer.

18:23.427 --> 18:24.685
Kick her to the curb.

18:25.077 --> 18:26.908
I think I'm gonna give her
another shot.

18:27.726 --> 18:28.898
We connected, you know?

18:28.979 --> 18:31.514
And it's not every day
that you find a...

18:32.104 --> 18:33.162
Level 5 sorceress.

18:35.470 --> 18:36.477
I know...

18:38.667 --> 18:40.419
- You have to tell him the truth.
- Maybe.

18:40.479 --> 18:43.120
Not until I'm absolutely sure
lying won't work.

18:44.377 --> 18:45.706
Tell me what you see, Gibbs.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.396
- A tire.
- It's not just any tire.

18:48.481 --> 18:51.712
It's a retro-edition radial P-396.

18:52.292 --> 18:54.715
An exact match to the tracks
that were at the crime scene.

18:55.296 --> 18:58.052
And it was especially made
for this bad boy.

18:58.133 --> 18:59.378
Now tell me what you see.

19:00.325 --> 19:01.806
'72 Buick Skylark.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.015
Look closer.

19:04.366 --> 19:06.300
- Pentagram.
- It's an aftermarket hub cap.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.337
There's a small company
in Texas that sold them.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.604
Okay, check this out.

19:10.854 --> 19:12.622
Wait for it...

19:16.711 --> 19:18.530
- Perfect match.
- When I saw that,

19:18.611 --> 19:21.337
I ran a full hydrocarbon panel
on Jennings' blood.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.911
The carbon monoxide
in his tissue had traces

19:23.992 --> 19:27.088
of naphthalenes
and polycyclic aromatics.

19:27.525 --> 19:29.041
- Car exhaust.
- Yeah.

19:29.523 --> 19:32.290
The CO poisoning came
from the car, Gibbs.

19:33.024 --> 19:34.723
Jennings had to be in the trunk!

19:34.783 --> 19:36.799
And the imprint on his back,

19:36.972 --> 19:39.327
- He was lying on the spare.
- He choked on the exhaust.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.511
He died in the trunk.

19:40.592 --> 19:42.763
And then he was carried
to the shack where he was...

19:43.308 --> 19:45.151
- sliced and diced.
- Abby...

19:45.211 --> 19:46.714
'72 Skylark.

19:46.774 --> 19:49.270
Custom hubcaps.
I already told Tony to put out a BOLO.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.313
I was gonna say: "Nice job".

19:53.393 --> 19:54.900
Obviously not nice enough.

19:55.435 --> 19:56.435
Fridge.

19:59.945 --> 20:01.824
I don't know how you did that
and I don't care.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.245
Thank you, Gibbs!

20:07.509 --> 20:10.279
So, what's a nice girl like you
doing at a top-secret,

20:10.339 --> 20:13.741
government counterespionage
gadget lab like this?

20:14.330 --> 20:16.155
Bet that sounded
better in your head.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.267
No, not really.
I like your glasses.

20:18.327 --> 20:19.890
Let it go, Tony.

20:20.089 --> 20:21.089
I can't.

20:21.212 --> 20:22.970
Let me guess. Hidden camera?

20:23.050 --> 20:24.956
Infrared? X-ray vision?

20:25.188 --> 20:28.058
I'm Dr. Daniel's assistant,
Agent DiNozzo.

20:29.328 --> 20:32.271
I make copies, get coffee.
I don't play with the toys.

20:34.687 --> 20:35.929
That's my job.

20:36.853 --> 20:38.153
Dr. Rod Daniels.

20:38.229 --> 20:40.696
You must be Officer David
and you are...

20:40.939 --> 20:43.339
Very Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.

20:43.730 --> 20:45.420
- Excuse me.
- Oh, neat.

20:45.782 --> 20:47.189
Acoustic bug in the stapler?

20:49.076 --> 20:51.926
I assume you'll want to take
a look at Captain Jennings' office?

20:51.986 --> 20:53.375
Eventually, yes.

20:55.244 --> 20:56.587
I just want to let you know,

20:56.844 --> 20:59.381
regardless of what your investigation
has uncovered

20:59.981 --> 21:01.402
or what you discover here...

21:02.424 --> 21:05.147
Thomas Jennings was
an honorable man and a patriot.

21:05.295 --> 21:07.137
So, we're gonna find something here?

21:07.547 --> 21:09.916
I'm obligated to inform you
that we have had a...

21:10.568 --> 21:11.310
breach.

21:11.483 --> 21:12.633
Specifically?

21:13.079 --> 21:14.563
A multithreaded mini-processor

21:14.644 --> 21:16.974
that enables our moles
to access enemy computer systems.

21:17.034 --> 21:18.150
We call it "Keyhole".

21:22.068 --> 21:23.168
This is a mock-up.

21:23.670 --> 21:25.043
USB-compatible.

21:25.638 --> 21:27.576
Disguised as a toothpaste cap.

21:27.775 --> 21:29.081
Easy to get through Customs.

21:29.141 --> 21:30.217
Nice!

21:30.544 --> 21:31.644
It was nice.

21:31.914 --> 21:34.326
It's missing and it's the last thing
you'd want misplaced,

21:34.386 --> 21:36.826
but I assure you Jennings
had nothing to do with it, he was...

21:36.855 --> 21:38.754
- We know, a patriot.
- Yes.

21:38.834 --> 21:42.591
And he was heavily searched every time
he left the lab area, just as I am,

21:43.115 --> 21:44.468
and just as you two will be.

21:44.715 --> 21:47.583
So, there's simply no way he could
have gotten anything out of here.

21:47.735 --> 21:49.172
You think Jennings swallowed it?

21:49.232 --> 21:51.715
It is the only way he could have
gotten it out of the lab.

21:51.775 --> 21:53.185
If it was stuck in his stomach,

21:53.266 --> 21:55.684
that'd explain the green goop
that Ducky found in his gut.

21:55.744 --> 21:57.523
All right, so he stole it.
Then what?

21:57.604 --> 22:00.488
We got a missing hi-tech
gizmo called "Keyhole", right?

22:00.773 --> 22:03.283
Encrypted e-mails
to some mystery contact overseas.

22:03.343 --> 22:04.530
Maybe he was selling it.

22:04.610 --> 22:07.175
Jennings must have arranged
to meet with his contact here.

22:07.235 --> 22:09.558
But they didn't want to wait
for nature to take its course.

22:09.858 --> 22:12.037
So they went dumpster diving
in his belly instead.

22:12.117 --> 22:13.706
Guys must have really been
in a rush.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.772
- Or decided they didn't want to pay.
- Yeah.

22:15.832 --> 22:16.832
Who is they?

22:16.958 --> 22:17.958
Thanks.

22:18.489 --> 22:19.585
Let's find out.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.922
BOLO just came back
on the '72 Buick Skylark.

22:22.361 --> 22:23.469
I'll call Gibbs.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.360
Nice rims.

22:34.628 --> 22:35.676
Another meet?

22:35.736 --> 22:36.990
Cockpit's empty.

22:37.142 --> 22:38.300
Must be inside.

22:38.485 --> 22:39.565
DiNozzo, McGee,

22:40.171 --> 22:41.175
around back.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.860
Ziva, you're with me.

23:05.492 --> 23:07.227
Boss, Brandon Sykes, 22.

23:07.388 --> 23:09.579
Small-time drifter
with a big-time rap sheet.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.452
Larceny, grand theft auto,

23:11.512 --> 23:14.705
dealing, even suspected
of a homicide over an iPod.

23:14.787 --> 23:16.375
Doesn't exactly scream espionage.

23:17.169 --> 23:18.953
- Hired gun.
- Hired by who?

23:19.082 --> 23:21.659
"Whom", Tony.
"Who" is the nominative case.

23:21.719 --> 23:24.088
"Whom" always follows a preposition.

23:24.489 --> 23:26.175
- Traffic bad?
- Dreadful.

23:26.263 --> 23:29.326
I'm having a better day
than this poor young man.

23:30.362 --> 23:31.516
Jumped or pushed?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.599
We rushed the warehouse... empty.

23:33.681 --> 23:35.685
Found signs of a struggle
on the roof, though.

23:35.788 --> 23:38.656
Yeah, well,
he has defensive wounds on his hands.

23:38.988 --> 23:40.478
Guess we're going with pushed.

23:40.968 --> 23:41.968
Okay, thanks.

23:42.466 --> 23:44.292
Vehicle is registered to Sykes.

23:44.873 --> 23:47.750
That places him at the warming hut
where Captain Jennings was killed.

23:47.811 --> 23:49.324
I doubt he was sightseeing.

23:49.384 --> 23:53.098
So Sykes kills the captain, takes
Keyhole from him, then comes here.

23:53.561 --> 23:56.122
Probably to make the delivery
to whomever hired him.

23:57.090 --> 23:58.396
Didn't work out so well.

23:58.761 --> 24:01.618
Someone is cleaning up
their loose ends.

24:09.425 --> 24:10.653
Rebecca's not coming.

24:11.235 --> 24:13.072
So she sends her ex-fiancé?

24:13.311 --> 24:15.596
Not ex. We're back together.

24:20.664 --> 24:23.501
I'm not sure if it's the right thing,
but she needs me.

24:24.644 --> 24:26.808
Well, I need her to look
at some photos.

24:27.193 --> 24:30.496
I know. But staring at the face
of her father's killer

24:30.612 --> 24:32.387
isn't something she's up for
at the moment.

24:32.447 --> 24:34.828
She asked if I could pick them up
and bring them to her.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.613
It doesn't work that way.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.351
This isn't easy for her,
Agent Gibbs.

24:42.427 --> 24:44.497
If it wasn't necessary,
I wouldn't ask.

24:51.372 --> 24:54.045
Fingerprints matched
a partial found in the warming hut.

24:55.615 --> 24:56.738
You know him?

24:58.281 --> 24:59.464
No. Who is he?

24:59.971 --> 25:01.786
I was hoping Rebecca would tell me.

25:04.224 --> 25:06.428
She wants to help, believe me.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.671
But she's in a very bad place
right now.

25:10.266 --> 25:11.870
Heck, she took me back.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.173
Just give her some time.

25:26.563 --> 25:27.675
For Rebecca.

25:28.645 --> 25:29.921
When she's ready.

25:31.515 --> 25:34.230
Rebecca Jennings,
22, native of Virginia.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.371
Recently graduated
from Indiana University,

25:36.431 --> 25:38.392
works part-time at a pet store.

25:38.631 --> 25:41.785
No criminal record, unless you count
a misdemeanor for disturbing the peace.

25:41.893 --> 25:43.870
She tossed her fiancé's clothes out

25:43.931 --> 25:46.054
a second-story window.
I hate it when that happens.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.931
She's not exactly
a criminal mastermind.

25:47.993 --> 25:50.577
Or the first family member
to not want to identify a killer.

25:50.637 --> 25:53.483
- Think she knows what Daddy was into?
- She knows something.

25:53.734 --> 25:55.945
Talk to her friends,
co-workers, everyone.

25:56.281 --> 25:59.243
- Why don't we just bring her in?
- What are we gonna put on the warrant,

25:59.303 --> 26:00.303
Gibbs' gut?

26:01.222 --> 26:03.707
Not that that wouldn't be valid.
I'm sure that...

26:03.792 --> 26:05.909
Just talk to her friends.
She'll come to us.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.102
So much for my date tonight.

26:10.807 --> 26:13.466
What are you doing?
So you giving the psycho another chance?

26:13.911 --> 26:15.787
Well, I was.
I guess now I got to cancel.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.312
What is that silliness?!

26:18.740 --> 26:19.740
Sorry.

26:20.449 --> 26:22.449
Ziva and I will cover
the interviews for you.

26:23.474 --> 26:25.290
That is awfully
un-Tony of you, Tony.

26:25.477 --> 26:27.151
Just doing you a solid, Probie.

26:27.449 --> 26:31.000
Because you having a date
is about as rare as me not having one.

26:41.694 --> 26:43.613
Am I a suspect, Agent Gibbs?

26:46.475 --> 26:48.679
- Sit down.
- Answer the question, please.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.845
Why are you investigating me?

26:58.537 --> 27:00.619
- It's my job.
- Are you serious?

27:02.086 --> 27:04.440
Do you think
that I had something to do with...

27:11.258 --> 27:12.319
Is that him?

27:13.756 --> 27:14.674
Who is he?

27:14.738 --> 27:16.555
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

27:17.444 --> 27:19.342
- But you know something.
- Yeah.

27:20.424 --> 27:23.873
I know that my father was murdered,
and you have no idea why.

27:24.712 --> 27:27.978
- And you don't either?
- I told you, I don't.

27:28.738 --> 27:31.493
You left him a message complaining
about his long trips.

27:32.841 --> 27:34.548
No idea where he's been going?

27:35.799 --> 27:36.799
None.

27:43.446 --> 27:44.936
Are you close to your father?

27:50.583 --> 27:51.583
Getting there.

27:55.247 --> 27:56.497
When my mom died...

27:57.619 --> 27:58.966
I was devastated.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.824
But I knew that I would be okay.

28:04.311 --> 28:05.763
I knew that I would make it.

28:10.058 --> 28:11.487
But this time...

28:12.322 --> 28:13.538
I'm not sure.

28:14.502 --> 28:18.153
I mean, don't get me wrong. I loved
my mom, I loved her more than anything.

28:19.902 --> 28:21.637
But he's my daddy.

28:25.614 --> 28:28.206
And now I have
no one left in my life.

28:30.053 --> 28:31.053
Kevin.

28:35.291 --> 28:37.214
I told him I wanted
to try to work things out,

28:37.281 --> 28:39.577
but our last engagement ended
with me...

28:40.647 --> 28:43.505
- Throwing his clothes out the window.
- You heard about that?

28:44.439 --> 28:45.603
He deserved it.

28:48.614 --> 28:50.961
But when my mom died,
Kevin was there for me.

28:53.614 --> 28:56.900
I just don't think I can make it
through something like this again.

28:59.787 --> 29:01.607
I don't have it in me.

29:01.880 --> 29:02.972
Yeah, you do.

29:06.666 --> 29:09.177
Might take you a while to find,
but you do.

29:12.851 --> 29:15.817
- Boss, hey, I got something here.
- McGee, you're working late.

29:16.186 --> 29:20.167
Yeah, actually, I... had a date tonight,
and she didn't show.

29:20.227 --> 29:23.705
So, I, really, I kind of ended up
in the area and I thought I'd...

29:23.765 --> 29:25.261
- Jeez, McGee.
- Sorry.

29:26.153 --> 29:27.593
Jennings' mystery e-mails,

29:27.653 --> 29:30.714
I was able to partially decrypt
the routing information in the header.

29:30.774 --> 29:32.569
- That's a good thing, right?
- Oh, yeah!

29:32.629 --> 29:36.560
Allowed me to ID the NIC address
on the recipient's computer.

29:36.809 --> 29:39.168
It's a laptop,
and it's in use right now.

29:39.641 --> 29:41.991
- Where?
- Captain Jennings' house.

29:59.078 --> 30:00.843
It's like I said,
it's always the maid.

30:00.972 --> 30:04.952
No. You have said it is always
the janitor or the butler

30:05.013 --> 30:07.003
or anyone assigned
to work in Abby's lab.

30:07.063 --> 30:09.736
But you have never once said "maid".

30:10.592 --> 30:13.224
Anyone ever tell you
your memory can be a real buzz kill?

30:26.994 --> 30:27.994
Who are you?

30:29.615 --> 30:30.707
Adrianna Lopez.

30:31.271 --> 30:32.822
I worked for Mr. Thomas.

30:36.416 --> 30:38.316
Captain Jennings' credit card record

30:38.722 --> 30:42.165
shows weekly payments
to an outside maid service.

30:43.779 --> 30:45.262
They never heard of you.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.649
Fact is, no one has.

30:50.272 --> 30:52.578
Six weeks ago,
you somehow got a green card.

30:53.332 --> 30:56.292
Before that,
there's no record of you at all.

30:59.944 --> 31:02.954
Who do you think she's working for?
Chinese? Russians?

31:03.562 --> 31:06.427
Cubans. After all, she is Cuban.

31:06.587 --> 31:09.120
That's way too obvious.
Haven't I taught you anything?

31:13.398 --> 31:15.422
Where'd you meet Captain Jennings?

31:16.699 --> 31:17.751
In Cuba.

31:19.880 --> 31:20.880
When?

31:21.460 --> 31:24.294
- Six months ago.
- You recruited him?

31:25.765 --> 31:27.488
Did I recruit... what...?

31:27.566 --> 31:29.839
Paid him to steal classified
technologies,

31:29.910 --> 31:31.431
- like Keyhole.
- No, wait.

31:32.119 --> 31:33.955
- Then you had him killed.
- No!

31:34.078 --> 31:36.119
- You used him!
- I loved him!

31:38.631 --> 31:39.961
Maybe it was the butler.

31:42.686 --> 31:44.974
Thomas was in Cuba
to oversee the installation

31:45.056 --> 31:46.873
of a new radar at the American base.

31:48.951 --> 31:50.420
He had just lost his wife.

31:52.568 --> 31:54.079
I had just lost my husband.

31:54.987 --> 31:57.273
He would come down
to see me whenever he could.

31:57.652 --> 31:59.173
But it wasn't easy.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.264
There are restrictions.

32:02.227 --> 32:04.799
And with his job,
it would have been impossible.

32:05.773 --> 32:07.916
But he was able to hide
where he was going.

32:11.514 --> 32:13.576
Eventually, he got me a green card.

32:15.354 --> 32:16.477
And I came here.

32:17.197 --> 32:18.687
To pretend to be his maid?

32:21.188 --> 32:24.236
We lied because Thomas didn't want
his daughter to know about us.

32:26.055 --> 32:27.810
Not yet. He thought it was too soon.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.596
And after he died,
you kept lying. Why?

32:33.424 --> 32:35.587
I did what I thought
Thomas would want me to.

32:44.543 --> 32:46.012
She's hiding something.

32:46.081 --> 32:48.769
I have posed as a girlfriend
many times to get what I needed.

32:48.861 --> 32:51.000
She pretended to be
Captain Jennings' girlfriend.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.155
Convinced him
to steal the missing gizmo.

32:53.769 --> 32:56.749
There's one problem with that, Ziva.
That's gizmo is not missing anymore.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.833
I just spoke with Dr. Daniels
at the ONI Lab.

32:59.997 --> 33:02.045
- They found Keyhole.
- They "found" it?

33:02.136 --> 33:04.556
- Where, under a couch?
- Subfloor.

33:04.668 --> 33:07.053
Jennings never tried
to get Keyhole out of the lab.

33:07.211 --> 33:09.041
He set it up for remote access.

33:09.205 --> 33:11.746
Dialed in from his basement,
used it to hack the ICE database,

33:11.806 --> 33:15.408
- get his girlfriend a green card.
- That's what she was hiding.

33:17.302 --> 33:19.098
Jennings gamed the system for her.

33:19.409 --> 33:20.859
No mystery handler.

33:21.215 --> 33:22.613
No espionage.

33:22.841 --> 33:25.022
So why in the hell was
Thomas Jennings filleted?

33:33.600 --> 33:35.589
I liked this case better
when we had a motive.

33:35.649 --> 33:38.468
- Yeah, then find one, DiNozzo.
- Easier said than done, boss.

33:38.570 --> 33:41.666
We're, trying to make a connection
between Jennings and his killer.

33:42.016 --> 33:44.631
Brandon Sykes.
But we hit a dead end.

33:45.246 --> 33:47.899
- No pun intended.
- Actually, it was.

33:48.231 --> 33:50.697
- In that case, nicely done.
- Focus on Sykes.

33:50.812 --> 33:53.171
Find his killer,
we'll find our motive. Ziva.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.939
I will talk to Sykes' parole officer.
Get a list of associates.

33:56.614 --> 33:59.308
Sykes moved around a lot, but
I think I have a lead on his apartment.

33:59.332 --> 34:01.413
- Take Tony with you.
- You mean: "Tony, take McGee".

34:01.473 --> 34:04.267
'Cause I'm a senior field agent,
which... that's not important.

34:04.389 --> 34:06.191
- Give me...
- Come on, Tony.

34:06.698 --> 34:08.596
I'm going to let you play
with the siren.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.440
Heard you got stood up
last night, Probie.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.511
She never even call.

34:17.643 --> 34:18.928
That ends that?

34:19.632 --> 34:20.632
Maybe.

34:20.812 --> 34:21.812
"Maybe"?

34:22.007 --> 34:23.464
Know when to fold 'em, McGee.

34:24.697 --> 34:26.034
NCIS, open up.

34:27.793 --> 34:29.202
This girl's not worth it.

34:29.786 --> 34:30.793
Trust me.

34:32.318 --> 34:33.686
Tony, I'm not like you.

34:34.380 --> 34:37.114
It's not that easy
for me to meet women.

34:37.373 --> 34:38.476
Never has been.

34:39.608 --> 34:42.246
That's why I was hoping
this girl might be...

34:43.458 --> 34:44.577
you know...

34:47.161 --> 34:48.389
You'll find your girl.

34:49.606 --> 34:50.657
Thought I did.

35:00.422 --> 35:01.425
NCIS.

35:01.951 --> 35:03.084
Federal agents.

35:08.571 --> 35:10.081
I love trashed apartments.

35:10.484 --> 35:13.065
Not my apartment.
I like my apartment pristine.

35:13.180 --> 35:16.381
The floors clean and the furniture
dusted, and the casket shined and...

35:17.485 --> 35:20.736
Trashed apartments. Okay, first thing
that I noticed is that it's trashed.

35:20.957 --> 35:21.960
Good eye.

35:23.157 --> 35:25.157
No. I mean, like, really trashed.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.379
There was a microscopic layer

35:27.439 --> 35:30.486
of a silicon carbide covering
pretty much the entire crime scene.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.259
Whoever trashed his apartment,

35:33.415 --> 35:35.605
went banzai on his dinner plates
with a hammer.

35:35.749 --> 35:38.798
- They were not looking for anything.
- No, they just wanted to trash it.

35:39.164 --> 35:41.266
And I know who "they" is.

35:41.645 --> 35:45.141
I pulled a partial print off the TV set
that was thrown into the bathtub.

35:45.475 --> 35:47.516
Meet our rock star.

35:49.097 --> 35:50.371
Hell, yeah, I did it!

35:50.558 --> 35:53.884
I went over to that Jackass' place
and I broke everything in sight.

35:54.388 --> 35:56.625
- That was easy.
- It was all my stuff anyway.

35:56.770 --> 35:58.994
You think that dumb ass
could afford real plates?

35:59.662 --> 36:02.580
When I met the guy,
he had a can opener and a plastic fork.

36:03.124 --> 36:05.451
The guy's a loser,
like all the rest of them.

36:06.270 --> 36:08.549
Sure I've had it. I'm done.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.002
So is Sykes. He's dead.

36:13.590 --> 36:14.590
"Dead"?

36:15.352 --> 36:17.821
- How?
- Murdered yesterday afternoon.

36:20.366 --> 36:22.279
- And you think I did it?
- Did you?

36:24.701 --> 36:26.382
I might have, if he'd had been home.

36:26.443 --> 36:29.875
But he wasn't, and I was at work
until 8:00 last night, check the logs.

36:30.050 --> 36:32.141
How'd your boyfriend
know Captain Jennings?

36:32.201 --> 36:33.201
He didn't.

36:35.009 --> 36:36.690
You think Brandon
killed the captain?

36:36.755 --> 36:38.355
I don't think. I know.

36:41.238 --> 36:42.239
I'm...

36:42.887 --> 36:45.641
I brought him to the Christmas party
last year, but

36:46.248 --> 36:48.635
he spent the whole night
in the parking lot throwing up.

36:48.942 --> 36:51.942
- Like I said, a real winner.
- That why you trashed his place?

36:53.043 --> 36:55.024
I trashed his place
because he proposed.

36:55.615 --> 36:57.167
I'll take that as a "no".

36:57.286 --> 37:01.033
Like everything else in Brandon's life,
the ring was fake.

37:04.926 --> 37:06.762
Turned my finger green.

37:09.765 --> 37:10.765
"Green"?

37:11.702 --> 37:14.462
- "Green."
- I'd say it's more of a Torrey pine.

37:16.686 --> 37:19.156
Basically,
it's the same color as this:

37:19.334 --> 37:22.000
The discoloration Ducky found
in Thomas Jennings' duodenum.

37:22.234 --> 37:23.805
As for the finger, that's easy.

37:24.055 --> 37:26.804
Most fake gold is made out of copper,
like this ring.

37:26.962 --> 37:30.900
And when the copper encounters the
natural acids in our sweat, it oxidizes.

37:30.967 --> 37:32.429
It turns the skin green.

37:33.464 --> 37:34.464
Torrey pine.

37:36.085 --> 37:38.413
Captain Jennings' gut is
where it gets interesting.

37:38.566 --> 37:41.733
The ring shows microscopic signs
of acidic deterioration.

37:41.870 --> 37:45.115
- Specifically, deoxycholic acid.
- Intestinal acid.

37:46.613 --> 37:50.205
This ring was
in Thomas Jennings' intestines.

37:55.140 --> 37:58.690
There was no description
of any intestinal obstruction

37:58.750 --> 38:02.547
in Captain Jennings' current
medical records. So I made inquiries.

38:02.607 --> 38:05.478
Finally, I was able
to contact his pediatrician.

38:05.538 --> 38:07.632
When Jennings was five,

38:07.775 --> 38:09.882
he was rushed to the ER...

38:10.305 --> 38:13.284
after swallowing
his mother's engagement ring.

38:14.132 --> 38:15.561
I kid you not.

38:15.728 --> 38:17.879
The doctors deemed
it too dangerous to operate

38:17.939 --> 38:20.141
and elected to wait
until it worked its way out.

38:20.201 --> 38:21.373
But it never did.

38:21.875 --> 38:24.579
No. As the boy grew,
the plicae circulares,

38:24.639 --> 38:28.333
the lining of the boy's duodenum,
simply closed around the ring,

38:28.550 --> 38:31.468
- keeping it in place.
- Who's got access to his records?

38:31.899 --> 38:34.100
Medical records are private, Jethro.

38:34.449 --> 38:36.612
But I doubt this story was.

38:36.816 --> 38:40.584
As family tales go, it's certainly
one of the more captivating.

38:40.685 --> 38:43.582
I'm sure dozens of people
heard the story.

38:43.874 --> 38:45.895
But only one of them's
been lying to us.

38:45.980 --> 38:48.858
We're going over the evidence from
Jennings' house, take a look at that.

39:03.809 --> 39:04.921
You okay?

39:06.618 --> 39:08.738
- You don't have to do this now.
- I know.

39:20.226 --> 39:21.634
You know, don't you?

39:27.269 --> 39:28.841
Why was my father murdered?

39:31.432 --> 39:32.656
Because of this.

39:36.574 --> 39:37.325
A ring?

39:37.385 --> 39:39.267
But it's not just any ring,
is it, Rebecca?

39:39.530 --> 39:41.510
No, it's my grandmother's
engagement ring.

39:41.576 --> 39:43.760
I recognize this from the photos,
but that...

39:50.327 --> 39:51.592
My father was...

39:54.183 --> 39:55.367
For a ring?

39:56.174 --> 39:57.786
- A fake ring.
- That's right.

39:57.913 --> 40:00.444
Grandpa proposed with a glass ring.

40:00.925 --> 40:03.394
Didn't know that part of
the family story, did you, Kev?

40:03.492 --> 40:05.532
Told your buddy, Sykes,
about the ring. Did you?

40:05.592 --> 40:07.415
All he had to do was go get it.

40:07.505 --> 40:10.708
- Four carats, hit paid for itself.
- You didn't even get your hands dirty.

40:10.873 --> 40:13.725
Until Sykes found out the ring was fake.
Then what happened?

40:14.131 --> 40:16.709
Did he try to blackmail you, Kev?
Is that why you killed him?

40:16.936 --> 40:17.936
Kevin?

40:19.380 --> 40:21.523
I told them,
I don't know this Sykes guy.

40:22.452 --> 40:23.942
Let's look at some photos.

40:24.685 --> 40:26.782
There's you at a party. See you?

40:27.722 --> 40:30.459
No, can't see it?
Let's blow it up.

40:36.661 --> 40:38.546
Becky, sweetie, I...

40:39.024 --> 40:41.011
- They put... why would I ever...
- Why?

40:41.653 --> 40:45.278
Because she broke off your engagement.
Because you were desperate.

40:45.393 --> 40:47.241
And killing her father's
supposed to help?

40:47.353 --> 40:49.758
Well, she broke up with you
two years ago, didn't she?

40:49.845 --> 40:51.790
Yeah, when my mom got sick.

40:52.658 --> 40:53.903
And I took you back.

40:54.039 --> 40:56.406
You were hoping history
was going to repeat itself?

40:56.733 --> 40:59.651
- This is insane.
- Unbelievably insane.

41:00.005 --> 41:01.611
And you are a psychopath.

41:01.671 --> 41:04.748
You've just leapfrogged to the top
of our "psychopath of the year" list.

41:05.873 --> 41:07.363
You had my father killed.

41:07.849 --> 41:11.814
- Baby, you know me. I would never...
- You son of a bitch!

41:14.213 --> 41:15.427
How could you?

41:18.207 --> 41:19.769
You didn't give me a choice.

41:35.236 --> 41:36.793
And he really thought it'd work?

41:37.426 --> 41:38.426
Almost did.

41:38.924 --> 41:41.623
Is killing for love really
any different than killing for money?

41:43.899 --> 41:45.177
Speaking of love,

41:45.730 --> 41:48.506
how's that...
cyber-romance going, McGee?

41:49.830 --> 41:51.095
It couldn't be worse.

41:51.518 --> 41:52.906
She sent me another e-mail.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.469
Said she's getting back
together with her ex-boyfriend.

41:58.675 --> 42:01.495
I'll tell you what though.
I'm not giving up on her.

42:02.005 --> 42:04.413
- Wha...?
- No, we got too much in common.

42:05.851 --> 42:08.810
I think she might be scared, but
you know what? We can work through it.

42:09.830 --> 42:12.150
I'm telling you, I think
this girl might really be the one.

42:18.820 --> 42:19.824
Take it.

42:20.832 --> 42:22.170
- Really?
- Sure.

42:22.287 --> 42:23.287
Thanks.

42:23.702 --> 42:25.804
Hey, listen, I hate to ask, but...

42:25.910 --> 42:28.053
Sure. I remember.

42:28.908 --> 42:31.227
$40. With interest.

42:32.375 --> 42:33.625
Sorry it took so long.

42:35.087 --> 42:37.380
All right, see you guys later.

42:43.957 --> 42:46.154
I didn't tell you
so you could torture him, McGee.

42:52.552 --> 42:53.552
Very well.
