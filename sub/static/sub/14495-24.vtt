00:02.201 --> 00:05.201
Captain Marvel here saved the life of Carol!

00:06.502 --> 00:09.202
<i> And he also revealed to be a spy
alien. </ I></i>

00:09.203 --> 00:12.503
said his people wanted to destroy our planet!

00:12.504 --> 00:14.504
The E.S.P.A.D.A. is responsible for situations...

00:14.505 --> 00:16.905
Any extraterrestrial presence.

00:16.906 --> 00:19.006
The Avengers
said he would try to help us...

00:19.007 --> 00:21.607
And this is what makes?
In attacking?

00:23.208 --> 00:26.908
As I did, the
krees come full force.

00:27.209 --> 00:28.709
We'll be here waiting.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.710
<i> Leaving the gravitational influence of Mercury... </ i></i>

00:37.711 --> 00:39.311
<i> and approaching the Sun </ i></i>

00:39.812 --> 00:41.612
shells hanging on,
Commander Corbeau.

00:41.613 --> 00:43.713
But at this distance the sun will incinerate...

00:43.714 --> 00:45.714
Any ship
made with Earth technology.

00:46.415 --> 00:48.215
Is very bright, too.
Thanks.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.716
Update the logbook.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.717
We are near the anomaly.
Continuing our investigation.

00:53.418 --> 00:54.718
It makes no sense.

00:54.719 --> 00:57.219
There are traces of non-active power of
wormhole.

00:57.220 --> 01:00.321
It is as if the
wormhole had opened on the other side...

01:00.322 --> 01:01.622
But not this one.

01:01.623 --> 01:03.423
And this is possible?

01:03.824 --> 01:07.424
I do not know.
Would ask that the scientists on Earth, but...

01:07.425 --> 01:09.725
Communications do not work so close to the Sun

01:09.726 --> 01:11.726
Not counting the time delay.

01:11.927 --> 01:14.227
The signal takes 8 minutes to return
Earth.

01:18.628 --> 01:20.228
We've got a visitor! </ I>

01:20.929 --> 01:22.229
<i> What are they? </ I></i>

01:22.230 --> 01:24.030
The largest is a warship Kree.

01:24.031 --> 01:26.031
I am sending a message
for SWORD

01:26.232 --> 01:29.933
Vultion 1 found hostile.
We are ready to face them.

<i> I hope that we survive to 8 minutes... </ i></i>

01:40.335 --> 01:42.635
that the message takes to get there.

01:44.636 --> 01:46.636
<i> That was 9 minutes. </ I></i>

01:47.337 --> 01:48.637
our way.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.565

01:52.566 --> 01:54.312

02:30.156 --> 02:31.756
<i> Start incursion. </ I></i>

02:43.757 --> 02:45.757
Something happened, not
?

02:50.458 --> 02:52.458
This was taken 20 minutes ago.

02:52.459 --> 02:54.359
We need to know why the Kree Empire...

02:54.360 --> 02:56.360
Parked six ships in front of our sun!

02:56.361 --> 02:58.161
This is just the beginning.

02:58.162 --> 03:00.462
The claim came krees system.

03:00.463 --> 03:03.063
Earth occupies a strategic position.

03:03.064 --> 03:04.564
<i> That makes no sense. </ I></i>

03:04.565 --> 03:08.165
As one planet may have strategic position?

03:08.166 --> 03:10.566
There's a whole space outside.
So how...

03:10.567 --> 03:13.368
Something in spacetime
sector makes it very easy...

03:13.369 --> 03:15.869
Find, open and
stabilize wormholes.

03:16.170 --> 03:17.670
You tell the truth.

03:17.671 --> 03:19.671
The Asgardians
have long known how easy it is...

03:19.672 --> 03:23.072
Traveling through the portals of this part of Midgard.

03:23.273 --> 03:25.373
After all, here is the
Middle Earth.

03:25.374 --> 03:27.874
The krees want to create a wormhole stable

03:27.875 --> 03:29.875
their fleets to pass through this area.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.576
Then, throughout the Galaxy,
in a snap.

03:32.577 --> 03:34.377
Your solar system will become...

03:34.378 --> 03:36.178
A place of residence for the Empire.

03:36.179 --> 03:38.179
<i> These ships near the Sun </ i></i>

03:38.180 --> 03:40.280
They do what?
They open a wormhole?

03:40.281 --> 03:43.081
Yes They act as a conduit of energy.

03:43.082 --> 03:44.682
And together, all five...

03:44.683 --> 03:47.383
Act as a portal, so
are activated.

03:47.784 --> 03:51.084
The Sun! Open
so close a hole in space-time...

03:51.285 --> 03:52.785
'll Break it in half.

03:52.786 --> 03:56.086
And in the end it will be the end of
all life on Earth.

03:56.387 --> 03:58.087
We've seen it happen.

03:59.588 --> 04:02.088
<i> Kang the Conqueror,
showed us the future. </ I></i>

04:05.089 --> 04:07.589
<i>
A future in which the Sun was split in half. </ I></i>

04:08.690 --> 04:10.490
Why krees
do that?

04:10.491 --> 04:12.091
Because they do not care with you.

04:12.092 --> 04:13.892
Do not care about life on Earth.

04:14.093 --> 04:16.692
<i> Actually, after that
that the Avengers have... </ i></i>

04:16.694 --> 04:18.894
<i> capturing and imprisoning the Kree Accuser... </ i></i>

04:18.894 --> 04:22.195
I suspect that the choice
a location so close to the sun ..

04:22.196 --> 04:23.496
Was just to punish you.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.997
Just.
We need to solve this.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.998
Lost contact with Vultion.

04:27.999 --> 04:29.599
The krees to detect.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.300
This seems to be a problem.

04:31.301 --> 04:33.301
The
sun is millions of miles...

04:33.302 --> 04:35.102
It will take months, maybe years
...

04:35.103 --> 04:37.903
I can change your ship to access the subspace.

04:37.904 --> 04:41.004
Can I take you up there and off
wormhole.

04:41.005 --> 04:43.305
Please
let me help you.

04:48.306 --> 04:50.506
Well, that's enough.

04:50.507 --> 04:53.207
Its
Quinjet can now reach the subspace.

04:53.208 --> 04:56.008
Also changed their shield and their spacesuits...

04:56.009 --> 04:58.009
To support the proximity of the star.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.710
You should not be just a xenobiologista?

05:00.711 --> 05:02.411
How do you know all this?

05:02.412 --> 05:05.712
No offense, but
is very basic engineering.

05:05.713 --> 05:08.713
Still am amazed that they have not passed the Moon

05:09.114 --> 05:10.414
We're working on it.

05:13.815 --> 05:15.415
I hate space.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.216
The lack of gravity affects my sights.

05:17.217 --> 05:20.717
Look at the bright side...
Its range is infinite.

05:20.718 --> 05:22.018
Really?

05:35.919 --> 05:38.519
My sensors are gone!
I'm blind!

05:38.820 --> 05:40.420
Someone drop these guys!

05:41.121 --> 05:44.121
What guys?
I'm not seeing anyone!

05:44.622 --> 05:46.722
That's it!
We're not seeing anything!

05:46.723 --> 05:48.023
None of us!

05:48.024 --> 05:49.324
Vision, and you?

05:49.325 --> 05:51.125
Do you have robot eyes!
Use them!

05:51.126 --> 05:52.926
Switching to infrared vision.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.727
Great!
A ninja alien!

06:01.728 --> 06:04.228
No. It's a secret agent Kree.

06:04.229 --> 06:06.229
Should be here to deliver Ronan.

06:08.230 --> 06:10.330
They can be seen in ultraviolet.

06:42.631 --> 06:44.631
Okay!
The sensors are back!

06:44.632 --> 06:46.432
Iron Man,
no time for that.

06:46.433 --> 06:49.233
The ships
krees are opening the portal right now!

06:49.234 --> 06:51.334
The more waiting,
more risk everything.

06:51.735 --> 06:54.335
<i> Protocol
Kree is to eliminate the fugitives. </ I></i>

06:54.336 --> 06:57.036
<i> explode If the Quinjet,
it's all over! </ I></i>

06:57.837 --> 06:59.637
We need a plan!

07:01.838 --> 07:03.438
Cap, Iron Man...

07:03.439 --> 07:05.039
Take the Avengers and leave!

07:05.040 --> 07:06.340
Head to the Sun!

07:06.341 --> 07:08.041
Brand and I take care of krees here!

07:08.042 --> 07:09.342
What? How?

07:09.643 --> 07:12.343
We will!
Thor, we need coverage!

07:14.744 --> 07:16.844
Avante, Avengers!

07:28.845 --> 07:30.145
Hank...

07:39.146 --> 07:41.946
Prepare to jump in the subspace in 3...

07:41.947 --> 07:43.347
2...

07:43.948 --> 07:45.748
1!
Come!

07:48.749 --> 07:50.449
Do you have a plan, do not have
?

07:50.450 --> 07:52.450
I think life is more fun without
plans.

08:00.651 --> 08:04.151
That was the subspace?
I think I'll puke.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.752
Is very bright!
I have a visual in Vultion!

08:08.453 --> 08:09.753
No.

08:11.054 --> 08:13.354
Turn!
Carol turn now!

08:32.054 --> 08:33.655
The  shells fell Vultion!

08:33.655 --> 08:35.756
They're coming back!
We need to get out of here!

08:35.756 --> 08:38.457
Iron Man, Thor lightweight,
Mar-Vell, Ms. Marvel and Vision...

08:38.457 --> 08:39.758
And take care of that ship!

08:39.759 --> 08:42.159
Panther, Wasp, Hawk and I'll dock in
Vultion...

08:42.159 --> 08:43.860
- And try to help.
- I agree.

08:43.861 --> 08:46.061
I hope you brought your sunscreen.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.062
Clean.

09:25.063 --> 09:27.163
Look where they step,
staff.

09:45.164 --> 09:46.464
People!

09:49.265 --> 09:50.965
Is Peter Corbeau.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.966
Is the commander designated by the SWORD

09:52.967 --> 09:55.567
Dr. Corbeau,
what happened here?

09:55.968 --> 10:00.368
They... They put...
Troops aboard.

10:00.369 --> 10:01.969
Do not we...

10:02.970 --> 10:04.470
He's still here!

10:04.471 --> 10:06.071
What are you still here?

10:18.072 --> 10:19.472
Here.

10:23.673 --> 10:25.773
Is the shrinking!
Open fire!

10:37.474 --> 10:38.774
Step on it.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.775
What part of "wait"
you not understand?!

10:53.076 --> 10:54.376
The first part .

10:54.777 --> 10:57.177
The krees tracked something.
A type of signal energy.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.478
I saw the map.

10:58.479 --> 11:01.279
Would not pras cells, and yes
pros underground New York.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.580
Arsenal.

11:02.616 --> 11:04.763
That's where the Universal Weapon Ronan.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.155
Come on.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.349
- It's insane.
- Agent Brand.

11:09.350 --> 11:11.573
We found a device.
Must be something of krees.

11:11.574 --> 11:13.293
What kind of device?

11:13.294 --> 11:16.289
The type
that will explode and destroy the entire season.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.916
Intangible My form can not pass...

11:31.917 --> 11:33.601
By ship's force field.

11:33.602 --> 11:35.670
That was unexpected.

11:35.671 --> 11:38.837
Mar-Vell, disable
need those shields.

11:40.081 --> 11:42.006
There is no way, period.

11:42.007 --> 11:44.233
The shields are made to be impenetrable.

11:45.469 --> 11:48.180
No
something can go through them.

11:48.181 --> 11:50.186
The ships have Kree
transport technology.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.270
- She goes through shields, no?
- Sure.

11:52.271 --> 11:54.949
There is a secret Kree frequency.

11:54.950 --> 11:57.445
His armor can emit a pulse modulated?

11:57.446 --> 12:00.150
- I need often.
- Equalize mine.

12:09.183 --> 12:11.730
Sir, our shields...
They fell.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.036
Destroy them!

12:20.748 --> 12:22.316
<i> My apologies. </ I></i>

12:23.204 --> 12:25.373
But I will not allow them to do that.

12:28.449 --> 12:31.222
Is a Kree Sentry!
Cap, beware!

12:46.494 --> 12:48.458
What happened to the rest of your team?

12:49.070 --> 12:51.002
Stayed behind to protect the crew...

12:51.003 --> 12:52.621
While they evacuated.

12:52.922 --> 12:54.287
Stay here.

13:14.338 --> 13:16.061
Pantera,
what are you doing?!

13:38.684 --> 13:40.030
What was that?

13:40.031 --> 13:42.647
I teleportei the Kree sentry
into the sun.

13:42.648 --> 13:44.281
Thanks for distract him while...

13:44.282 --> 13:46.033
I understand the ship's systems.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.381
I hate you really.

13:48.382 --> 13:50.618
This is Captain America
for Iron Man.

13:50.619 --> 13:53.104
Do you hear me?
We dominate the Vultion.

13:53.105 --> 13:55.788
We <i>
5 seconds to master the bridge Kree, Ch </ i></i>

13:56.016 --> 13:58.129
You lost, man,
quit.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.466
Lost?
The Empire already won.

14:08.991 --> 14:12.432
Krees are good fighters, but
overconfident.

14:12.433 --> 14:15.669
Yes, the Empire has won?
What does this mean?

14:15.670 --> 14:18.624
What
ship's generators are activating.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.192
We arrived too late.

14:37.270 --> 14:38.655
Great Accuser...

14:38.656 --> 14:41.423
Please if we release
Universal Weapon...

14:41.424 --> 14:43.217
And to present to you.

15:02.223 --> 15:03.973
<i> Yellow Jacket, here is
Brand. </ I></i>

15:03.974 --> 15:05.733
<i> need you up here now. </ I></i>

15:05.734 --> 15:08.458
Not ... a good... hours.

15:09.137 --> 15:11.258
Look, the krees
have a device here...

15:11.259 --> 15:13.686
With counting to explode.
If you do not stop him...

15:13.687 --> 15:15.526
A crater where there is New York.

15:15.527 --> 15:17.706
Whatever I do about it?

15:18.293 --> 15:22.107
<i> I want to stop being crazy
for 5 minutes and be Hank Pym </ i></i>

15:24.205 --> 15:25.623
Okay.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.415
<i>
Wormhole is active. </ I></i>

15:52.416 --> 15:55.677
At this rate of growth it will compromise the
sun ..

15:55.678 --> 15:57.289
In 6.2 minutes.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.105
Thanks for explaining this,
Vision.

15:59.707 --> 16:01.205
Iron Man, look!

16:01.748 --> 16:03.228
We have to do something.

16:04.603 --> 16:06.610
Generators of the ship,
have to blow them up.

16:06.611 --> 16:08.472
They are inside the wormhole.

16:08.473 --> 16:11.800
- We can not touch them.
- Come on! We gotta do something!

16:12.325 --> 16:14.998
The generators are
space inside the tunnel?

16:14.999 --> 16:18.143
Come on in and
destroy from the inside out, then.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.508
Can we do this?

16:19.509 --> 16:22.566
Iron Man, Captain Marvel,
are hearing this?

16:22.567 --> 16:24.077
<i> We're listening, T'Challa. </ I></i>

16:24.078 --> 16:26.680
Traveling through the wormhole
is almost instantaneous.

16:26.681 --> 16:29.486
Find, shoot and hit targets inside
5...

16:29.822 --> 16:31.730
Would be almost impossible.

16:31.731 --> 16:33.100
Not for me.

16:35.256 --> 16:37.522
What if we could somehow
delay things.

16:37.523 --> 16:39.495
Try to anchor within the wormhole?

16:39.496 --> 16:41.908
This is not possible.
The Vultion.

16:42.315 --> 16:44.764
The Vultion has a tractor beam
theoretically...

16:44.765 --> 16:47.901
Quinjet could hang in and hold them in subspace.

16:47.902 --> 16:50.562
But the effort leave the ship in minutes.

16:50.563 --> 16:52.443
The Hawk
have to shoot so fast.

16:52.444 --> 16:53.776
You do not understand.

16:53.777 --> 16:56.737
When the gate closes,
he is on the other side.

16:57.227 --> 17:00.078
He will be arrested in Kree space
no way back home.

17:00.079 --> 17:01.942
Nay, not alone.

17:01.943 --> 17:04.539
- I will accompany you.
- Me too.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.003
Just like me.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.172
Looks like we have a plan.

17:11.068 --> 17:13.905
Yeah, did not discover anything,
it will explode.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.634
I think you have 25 seconds.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.296
Can not evacuate
2 million people, there is no time.

17:18.297 --> 17:19.707
You have to do something.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.843
She will detonate,
can not stop it.

17:22.301 --> 17:23.738
10 seconds.

17:26.109 --> 17:29.245
- Pym.
- My name is Yellow Jacket.

17:29.246 --> 17:30.546
No!

17:34.026 --> 17:35.577
2 seconds.

17:35.578 --> 17:36.915
I do not...

17:37.702 --> 17:40.516
- What did you do?
- I sent her pro microverso.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.393
It destroyed  some molecules.

17:43.172 --> 17:45.161
Why did
it from the beginning?

17:45.162 --> 17:46.625
Why have you waited?!

17:46.626 --> 17:48.602
I just wanted to see his expression.

17:52.899 --> 17:55.831
<i> We are already on board and ready to release
Quinjet Pantera. </ I></i>

17:55.832 --> 17:57.991
- Accelerated.
- Understood, Captain.

17:57.992 --> 17:59.663
Search systems locked.

18:06.084 --> 18:08.812
- What happened?
- An explosion in Vultion.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.095
Pantera, can you hear me?

18:11.096 --> 18:13.336
<i> Has to go to hatch
right now, soldier. </ I></i>

18:13.935 --> 18:15.751
I can not I'm afraid to do that.

18:15.752 --> 18:17.348
<i> Impending failure in the engines. </ I></i>

18:17.349 --> 18:19.773
<i> Automated,
disabled. </ I></i>

18:19.774 --> 18:22.889
<i> Alert,
you are on a collision course with the Sun </ i></i>

18:22.890 --> 18:25.032
- Alert.
- Pantera, what's happening?

18:25.033 --> 18:26.405
The onboard computer ...

18:26.406 --> 18:28.620
Can not keep the signal from the tractor beam.

18:28.621 --> 18:30.414
I must activate it manually.

18:30.415 --> 18:32.593
I'll stay aboard the ship.

18:32.594 --> 18:34.254
This is not an option,
T'Challa.

18:34.255 --> 18:36.540
Hold on,
're going to get it.

18:36.972 --> 18:38.317
He needs our help.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.654
- We have...
- Do not arrive on time, Thor.

18:40.655 --> 18:42.115
And without the tractor beam...

18:42.116 --> 18:44.611
We have no hope of destroying the generators.

18:45.103 --> 18:47.897
The Sun dies,
Earth dies.

18:53.259 --> 18:55.237
Let's not let it
back, Tony.

18:55.573 --> 18:57.336
<i> Cap, that is. </ I></i>

18:57.337 --> 18:59.518
<i>
This is the moment in which Kang said. </ I></i>

18:59.519 --> 19:01.311
<i> decision that will now... </ i></i>

19:01.630 --> 19:03.269
<i> is what will determine the future. </ i></i>

19:03.270 --> 19:05.289
If we do not close that wormhole...

19:05.290 --> 19:07.032
Is over for everyone.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.119
The Iron Man is right, Captain.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.868
<i> That's all that matters. </ I></i>

19:22.039 --> 19:23.361
T'Challa...

19:23.362 --> 19:26.194
Now I'm just doing what my father has done.

19:26.195 --> 19:28.221
I protect Wakanda.

19:28.222 --> 19:30.536
<i> But unlike any other
Black Panther... </ i></i>

19:31.071 --> 19:34.474
<i>
I have the privilege to do so by your side... </ i></i>

19:34.475 --> 19:36.533
<i > as an Avenger. </ i>

19:38.369 --> 19:40.417
We entered, Ch

19:42.786 --> 19:44.129
I know what to do.

19:44.130 --> 19:46.776
Hawkeye, Panther,
prepare.

19:50.483 --> 19:52.420
The PANTERA
tractor beam is activated.

19:52.421 --> 19:55.168
<i> Clint, do not miss. </ I></i>

19:55.169 --> 19:59.152
In 3, 2, 1...

20:14.086 --> 20:15.864
Hawkeye, now!

20:48.170 --> 20:50.434
Nodes .. we are alive?

20:54.221 --> 20:55.943
Not for long.

21:07.944 --> 21:12.944
