00:14.700 --> 00:17.610
- Okay, I double dare you to

00:17.610 --> 00:18.750
walk around naked.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.243
- Ohh, come on.

00:21.348 --> 00:22.679
- Gotta do it, gotta do it.

00:22.679 --> 00:23.679
- You gotta.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.220
- Is it true that back in college,

00:27.220 --> 00:28.600
you and Stacey did it?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.150
- Two weeks, two weeks.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.100
- Is it true that
you lied about your test

00:46.100 --> 00:47.980
to Miss Spanglish?

00:47.980 --> 00:49.166
- How did that rumor get out?

00:49.166 --> 00:50.565
- I know you did.

00:55.423 --> 00:59.104
- Just take that cat
and throw him over the bridge.

00:59.937 --> 01:00.770
I'll do it.

01:00.770 --> 01:01.952
- No you don't.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.910
- She's such a bitch.

01:05.910 --> 01:07.360
- So it wasn't just me.

01:11.970 --> 01:13.550
Is it true you used to cut yourself

01:13.550 --> 01:15.620
in Miss Taylor's class?

01:15.620 --> 01:16.653
- You saw that?

01:17.980 --> 01:19.617
- Loser.

01:19.617 --> 01:23.367
- I dare you to
go cut Lexi's finger.

01:44.050 --> 01:46.289
- Can you tell me what happened?

01:46.289 --> 01:47.860
Ma'am?

01:47.860 --> 01:49.230
Ma'am?

01:49.230 --> 01:51.128
- It all started with a game

01:51.128 --> 01:52.273
of Truth or Double Dare.

02:15.940 --> 02:16.773
- Hey, Michelle.

02:17.826 --> 02:18.778
- Hey.

02:18.778 --> 02:22.350
- Missed you in physics study group.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.620
- I'm sorry, I had a
tutoring session with Claudia

02:24.620 --> 02:26.600
I completely forgot about.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.460
- Yeah, you're the best tutor in class.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.410
I wouldn't be able to pass without you.

02:31.290 --> 02:32.770
- I'm sure you'll ace your final.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.660
You have nothing to worry about.

02:34.660 --> 02:36.250
- So you say.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.710
- Your mother loves to brag
about her little Johnny,

02:38.710 --> 02:41.870
who hasn't got anything short
of an A since kindergarten.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.710
I'm sure you won't let
this one little test

02:43.710 --> 02:45.120
get in the way of her gloating.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.070
- All right, girls.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.913
One, two, three, four.

02:51.460 --> 02:54.313
- Yo, Rashad, what's up, man?

02:54.313 --> 02:56.015
- My man, what's up, boy?

02:56.015 --> 02:57.130
- What's up, buddy?

02:57.130 --> 02:59.020
Man, you guys are looking
so good out there.

02:59.020 --> 03:01.410
- Yeah, yeah, last game
of high school year, man,

03:01.410 --> 03:03.523
we gotta look good, we
gotta stay sharp, you know.

03:03.523 --> 03:05.810
Look at you, Mr. Humble.

03:05.810 --> 03:08.690
- Okay, Okay, what's up,
Alex, what do you want, man?

03:08.690 --> 03:10.310
- That how it's gonna be?

03:10.310 --> 03:12.220
I know about the scouts
coming to the game.

03:12.220 --> 03:13.510
- That doesn't mean
they're coming to see me.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.590
- One, two.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.160
Keep to the beat, and three, and four.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.740
Start over, with steps one and two, and--

03:21.740 --> 03:24.563
Ah, Egypt, get lost, girl, oh my God.

03:27.442 --> 03:29.563
Oh, she's so annoying.

03:34.308 --> 03:35.650
- Oh my God.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.800
I love you so much,
we'll be together soon.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.470
- You know you're gonna
have to stay in the gym.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.020
Bulked up on protein shakes and shit.

03:45.020 --> 03:48.460
- Yeah, dog, I got it man,
you know I got this, baby.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.160
Wait, wait, wait, is that Claudia?

03:51.263 --> 03:54.940
Bro, I don't know how you got
all that jelly and no toast.

03:54.940 --> 03:55.773
- It's all mine.

03:55.773 --> 03:57.950
- Y'all are never gonna
make it, I promise you.

03:59.609 --> 04:02.963
♪ My first, my last ♪

04:02.963 --> 04:05.391

04:08.891 --> 04:12.280
- Oh my God, Chris Tucker, right?

04:12.280 --> 04:13.880
- Barry White, dumbass.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.230
- What's going on, baby?

04:17.230 --> 04:20.041
- Nothing, we're just getting
ready for dance practice.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.890
- Are you guys done
with the basketball gym,

04:21.890 --> 04:24.230
because we totally need it now?

04:24.230 --> 04:25.400
- You totally need it now.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.217
Yeah, we're out, man, I got you.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.679
- So you about to do
your little dance thing?

04:32.679 --> 04:37.393
- Yeah, why, you gonna watch?

04:37.393 --> 04:39.160

04:39.160 --> 04:39.993
Five minutes.

04:41.010 --> 04:41.843
That's it.

04:43.132 --> 04:43.965
Have fun.

04:45.828 --> 04:46.828
- Oh my God.

04:49.100 --> 04:49.933
Sorry, guys.

04:51.062 --> 04:53.460
- Well, maybe I should
meet up with you tomorrow

04:53.460 --> 04:55.063
and help you with your physics.

04:56.010 --> 04:56.843
- Why not today?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.460
- Promised Egypt I would
meet up with her later,

04:59.460 --> 05:01.863
and if I don't, I will
not hear the end of it.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.370
- All right, tomorrow it is.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.370
But if you stand me up,

05:07.370 --> 05:09.220
then you'll never hear the end of it.

05:11.730 --> 05:12.563
Okay.

05:13.657 --> 05:14.490
- I'll see you tomorrow.

05:17.530 --> 05:22.049
- Lucas, fix yourself,
man, you're saluting me.

05:22.049 --> 05:23.340
- Sorry.

05:23.340 --> 05:27.660
- It's all good, man, Egypt
has that effect on people.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.980
Anyways, I want you to meet my friend.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.440
- Oh, Felicia.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.273
- Hi, Lucas.

05:32.273 --> 05:35.438
- Oh, so y'all know each other already?

05:35.438 --> 05:37.990
- Yeah, we have chemistry together.

05:37.990 --> 05:41.390
And he has A lunch, his locker's in D pod.

05:41.390 --> 05:44.850
He wears jeans on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays,

05:44.850 --> 05:46.453
and his favorite color is green.

05:48.550 --> 05:50.780
- Okay, well,

05:50.780 --> 05:53.230
Ima let you have some privacy together.

05:53.230 --> 05:55.081
Felicia, yell if you need me.

05:55.081 --> 05:56.203
- Yeah, okay, bye.

06:00.270 --> 06:03.193
- No, I am not telling you
what's on the chem final.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.780
Because that's cheating, you're just gonna

06:05.780 --> 06:08.180
have to go in there and
suffer like I did today.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.620
Well then you're just
gonna have to suck it up.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.793
Go on, test isn't gonna take itself.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.267
Um, I have to go, I'll
call you back, okay?

06:19.763 --> 06:21.013
- Alex.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.183
Alex.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.393
- Really, guys?

06:28.530 --> 06:29.363
Egypt.

06:32.370 --> 06:34.750
- Damn, Michelle, can you go
wait in the house or something?

06:34.750 --> 06:35.703
We're almost done.

06:39.589 --> 06:40.422
- Lucas.

06:40.422 --> 06:42.520
- Oh, sorry, Michelle, I
didn't mean to frighten you.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.130
- What are you doing here?

06:44.130 --> 06:46.270
- You forgot this at school.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.293
- Thanks, um, thanks a lot.

06:49.619 --> 06:51.480
- Is Egypt here?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.730
- No she isn't, I'll
tell her you stopped by.

06:54.770 --> 06:56.643
- Then why do you have her bag?

06:57.970 --> 07:00.820
- She left it in my locker today.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.060
I'm gonna give it to her later.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.680
- I'll take it for you.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.530
- I don't think that's the best idea.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.150
I'll see you at school tomorrow, okay?

07:20.847 --> 07:21.950
- Michelle!

07:21.950 --> 07:24.760
- My God, Egypt, you scared
the daylights out of me.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.060
- Why are you so jumpy?

07:26.060 --> 07:27.430
- You and Lucas have it bad about jumping

07:27.430 --> 07:28.735
out at me like that.

07:28.735 --> 07:29.970
It's gonna catch up to
you one of these days.

07:29.970 --> 07:32.120
- Wait, was Lucas here earlier?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.970
- Lucas is the least of your worries.

07:46.939 --> 07:47.772
- Egypt, ohhhh.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.830
- You and Alex have to stop.

07:57.830 --> 07:59.720
I don't wanna be around
when Claudia finds out.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.600
- What do you mean when?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.491
She's not gonna find out.

08:07.502 --> 08:09.810
- Who the hell did that to you?

08:09.810 --> 08:11.480
- Drive, Alex, drive!

08:11.480 --> 08:12.403
Just drive!

08:17.835 --> 08:19.485
- All right, I do feel kinda bad.

08:20.795 --> 08:21.805
- No you don't.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.150
- I don't.

08:23.150 --> 08:25.590
Okay, let's go inside, I'm so hungry.

08:25.590 --> 08:26.870
- Ah, no.

08:26.870 --> 08:28.240
My dad is still pissed about finding you

08:28.240 --> 08:29.830
in his bed with my brother.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.376
Remember?

08:31.376 --> 08:32.870
- Whatever.

08:32.870 --> 08:34.280
- Hey, E?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.169
- Change of heart.

08:35.169 --> 08:36.820
- Yeah, I just wanted to say,

08:36.820 --> 08:39.253
stop screwing Alex on
the side of my house.

08:42.929 --> 08:43.763
I mean it.

08:52.604 --> 08:54.603
- Yo, Rashad.
- Yo, Rashad.

08:54.603 --> 08:57.033
- Yo, you boys come to play, man?

08:59.340 --> 09:01.593
Yo, Juan, let me holler
at you for a minute, man.

09:03.624 --> 09:05.025
- Yeah, what's up, dude?

09:05.025 --> 09:06.100
- That's what I wanna know.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.500
- What you mean?

09:07.500 --> 09:09.870
- Dog, nobody hits the gym
and is getting buff like this.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.395
Man, what's up?

09:11.395 --> 09:12.864
What's the secret?

09:12.864 --> 09:15.036
All right, man, all right.

09:15.036 --> 09:16.300
You gotta keep this on the down-low.

09:16.300 --> 09:17.880
- Hey, yo, steroids?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.700
That's against team policy, isn't it?

09:19.700 --> 09:21.810
- Oh, it's against team policy?

09:21.810 --> 09:23.238
What are you gonna do, rat on me?

09:23.238 --> 09:24.071
Come on, it's the offseason.

09:24.071 --> 09:25.703
I'm just trying to bulk up a little bit.

09:26.550 --> 09:29.716
And, dude, you might wanna do the same.

09:29.716 --> 09:31.730
Look a little lean here.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.070
I could floss my teeth with those things.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.150
They got some big dudes in the ACC.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.910
- Yeah, I know, but I mean, is it safe?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.390
I don't wanna end up with limp dick.

09:38.390 --> 09:39.690
- No, no, man, you're good.

09:39.690 --> 09:42.010
The little Juanito's doing
great, take my word for it.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.310
You wanna feel?

09:43.310 --> 09:45.456
- Get outta here, man.

09:45.456 --> 09:47.403
- All right, so you want in on this?

09:49.400 --> 09:50.363
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

09:54.970 --> 09:57.590
- Lucas, what the hell?

09:57.590 --> 09:59.140
- Will you be with me?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.320
I love you, Egypt?

10:01.320 --> 10:03.090
- Are you serious?

10:03.090 --> 10:05.920
- Look, look, I've found someone,

10:05.920 --> 10:09.680
and I like her, but I love you.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.430
I love you so much, I always have.

10:11.430 --> 10:12.610
You mean everything to me.

10:12.610 --> 10:13.960
It's always been about you.

10:15.230 --> 10:18.060
Just tell me you love me, Egypt, please.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.840
- I would love for you to take a bath,

10:19.840 --> 10:21.370
because, honestly, it smells like

10:21.370 --> 10:23.480
you slept in horse shit last night.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.400
And by the way, this whole us thing?

10:25.400 --> 10:26.860
It's never gonna happen.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.023
So just leave me alone.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.280
- I love pizza day, it's my favorite.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.783
- Especially with chocolate milk.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.233
Lucas?

10:45.220 --> 10:46.053
- What's his problem?

10:46.053 --> 10:48.030
- Uh, probably something to do with Egypt.

10:48.030 --> 10:50.075
I'll check on him later, are you okay?

10:50.075 --> 10:51.425
- Yeah.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.490
- Oh, LuLu, this is gonna be so wonderful.

11:07.490 --> 11:10.800
Our room overlooks the ocean,

11:10.800 --> 11:13.720
and there will be complimentary breakfast.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.183
This is so perfect.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.273
- Baby, please, talk to me.

11:34.450 --> 11:35.727
What happened?

11:38.571 --> 11:39.900
- My dad and I just,

11:39.900 --> 11:40.827
we just got into an argument.

11:40.827 --> 11:42.053
- And he hit you?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.433
- Alex, no, it's not what you think.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.923
It's just my dad.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.113
- Yeah, man, it was another team.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.584
It might be, what you
talking about, I killed it.

12:01.603 --> 12:03.433
Hey, who's there?

12:04.870 --> 12:07.270
Hey, man, let me call you
back, some crazy shit.

12:21.910 --> 12:24.717
- I wanted to wait till graduation.

12:26.475 --> 12:27.956
- What?

12:27.956 --> 12:28.789
What?

12:34.817 --> 12:37.067
- It's me and you, forever.

12:40.530 --> 12:43.180
- Baby, are you serious?

12:43.180 --> 12:44.013
- Forever.

12:47.170 --> 12:48.690
- Yes.

12:48.690 --> 12:50.040
Yes.

12:50.040 --> 12:50.997
Oh my God.

13:24.980 --> 13:27.773
- Hey, babe, look
what Chiggy just sent us.

13:30.439 --> 13:32.903
- OMG, we are so there.

13:34.610 --> 13:35.443
Babe,

13:36.290 --> 13:38.950
oh my God, I need to
book a hair appointment.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.000
What am I gonna wear?

13:42.110 --> 13:42.943
Oh shit.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.800
You know what, Babe, I
need your credit card.

13:48.340 --> 13:49.173
- Why?

13:50.142 --> 13:51.340
- Well you don't expect me to go

13:51.340 --> 13:53.563
in like old, raggedy clothes, do you?

14:06.660 --> 14:07.770
- Geez, babe.

14:07.770 --> 14:10.630
- Sorry, gotta get that fixed, huh?

14:11.626 --> 14:14.250
Kind of excited to see the class of 2006

14:14.250 --> 14:16.380
at Chiggy's party, what about you?

14:16.380 --> 14:17.588
- What?

14:17.588 --> 14:19.533
What are you talking about?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.348
- You didn't check your email yet?

14:22.348 --> 14:23.181
- Mm-mmm.

14:23.181 --> 14:24.630
- Chiggy sent an invite.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.533
See, look.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.660
He's hosting the class of 2006.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.493
Look.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.703
- Hello?

15:01.703 --> 15:02.858
- God, seriously.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.823
- Yeah.

15:05.823 --> 15:07.023
Yeah, it's good.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.693
Reunion, this weekend?

15:16.160 --> 15:18.180
Everybody gonna be there?

15:18.180 --> 15:20.230
Wait, we talking about the class reunion?

15:22.080 --> 15:25.293
I forgot, oh man, that's gonna be crazy.

15:26.130 --> 15:28.253
Wait, the whole team?

15:29.990 --> 15:31.320
All right, yeah, I'm there.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.873
Send that invite, all right.

15:33.873 --> 15:34.706
All right.

15:36.773 --> 15:38.213
All right, babe, I'm back.

15:41.430 --> 15:42.263
- Who was that?

15:43.440 --> 15:45.100
You're not even gonna invite me?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.610
- I'm inviting you back into the bed.

15:46.610 --> 15:47.960
What are you talking about?

15:49.280 --> 15:50.113
Why are you worried about that?

15:50.113 --> 15:51.840
- You never take me anywhere.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.640
All we do is come here and have sex.

15:54.505 --> 15:56.460
- Oh man, man, man, man, man,

15:56.460 --> 15:59.590
you wanna just talk
about it, or you wanna,

15:59.590 --> 16:00.604
or you wanna get back to it?

16:00.604 --> 16:02.144
- I'm done.

16:02.144 --> 16:03.880
Find someone else to have sex with.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.035
- Yeah.

16:05.035 --> 16:07.815
♪ Running round the city,
feeling like Diddy ♪

16:07.815 --> 16:11.088

16:19.147 --> 16:21.853
I don't cut off T. Swift while
you're howling to it, huh?

16:24.810 --> 16:26.563
Babe, what are you worried about?

16:29.620 --> 16:31.233
Look, calm down, okay?

16:33.478 --> 16:34.778
- I just don't feel right.

16:37.050 --> 16:39.480
- Honey, I know what
you're thinking about.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.180
What happened to Juan all those years ago

16:42.180 --> 16:44.600
was terrible, but look, they
caught the guy, all right.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.273
So you got nothing to worry about.

16:48.310 --> 16:50.050
Michelle, it's just a party.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.378
Look, at the very least
we show up, we show face,

16:53.378 --> 16:55.880
and we leave if it gets awkward.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.030
Can you do that for me?

16:58.030 --> 17:00.917
- Fine, but half an hour and that's it.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.363
- That's all I need.

17:03.570 --> 17:04.403
Yeah?

17:04.403 --> 17:05.236
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.803
- Great party, woo-hoo.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.210
- I see Chiggy still knows
how to throw a party.

17:21.210 --> 17:24.329
- Michelle, you're just
as stuck up as I remember.

17:24.329 --> 17:26.900
- And half-naked
is still your style, huh?

17:26.900 --> 17:28.214
- You're such a bitch.

17:29.470 --> 17:31.233
John, is that you?

17:32.210 --> 17:34.750
- It's good to see you again.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.800
The years have been good to you.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.370
- Wait, are you two like together now?

17:39.370 --> 17:41.740
- Yep, he's all mine.

17:41.740 --> 17:43.170
- Now that I think about,

17:43.170 --> 17:46.640
there was a lot of flirting
going on back in the day.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.013
Anyways, class of 2006, here we come.

17:56.358 --> 17:58.140
♪ My best friend's girlfriend ♪

17:58.140 --> 18:00.930
♪ That's a party now, that's a party now ♪

18:00.930 --> 18:04.823
- Hey, so, no cellphones allowed inside.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.350
But it's okay, Chiggy does not want

18:08.350 --> 18:09.930
this party on social media,

18:09.930 --> 18:12.023
no videos, no photos, none of that, okay?

18:13.077 --> 18:14.560
So, if you need to use your phone,

18:14.560 --> 18:16.710
you are more than
welcome to come back out.

18:17.871 --> 18:18.788
Cellphones.

18:21.076 --> 18:21.909
Thanks.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.053
Have fun.

18:28.895 --> 18:30.055
Cellphones.

18:58.150 --> 18:59.023
- Hey, Rashad.

19:01.325 --> 19:03.126
- What's up, man?

19:03.126 --> 19:05.071
- Hey, Rashad, man, how's it going?

19:05.071 --> 19:06.427
- Yo, how are you, man?

19:06.427 --> 19:08.510
I see you got your Carlton Bay sweater on.

19:08.510 --> 19:10.830
- You got jokes, huh?

19:10.830 --> 19:12.070
Hey, everything's great.

19:12.070 --> 19:13.580
We caught Egypt at the door.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.363
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, same old Egypt.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.340
What's Michelle doing now?

19:18.340 --> 19:20.800
- I've been telling her
for years she can't dance.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.400
That's my baby girl, though.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.740
- Wait, wait, wait, you
two are an item now?

19:24.740 --> 19:25.720
When did that happen?

19:25.720 --> 19:27.680
- Officially, after graduation,

19:27.680 --> 19:29.980
but we were hanging out that whole year.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.720
Listen, you know next
week is her birthday.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.650
I'm gonna propose.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.780
- Yo, dog, great news, man.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.390
She's gonna make you one happy dude.

19:38.390 --> 19:39.810
- I appreciate that.

19:39.810 --> 19:41.060
She's an amazing woman.

19:41.060 --> 19:44.070
Hey, but you, you're
the big basketball star.

19:44.070 --> 19:45.390
- Aw, man, you know I don't play anymore.

19:45.390 --> 19:46.223
- What, why?

19:47.070 --> 19:49.230
- It's a long story, but you know what?

19:49.230 --> 19:52.481
Follow me, this is what it's all about.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.375
- What's up, baby, what's up now?

20:05.629 --> 20:06.686
- Good to see you, man.

20:06.686 --> 20:07.800
- Looking good, man.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.120
- I try, you know, I try.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.070
You guys are great.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.160
Egypt.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.490
- Alex.

20:15.490 --> 20:16.323
- Hi.

20:17.420 --> 20:18.470
It's good to see you.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.380
- You look great.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.213
- Thank you.

20:23.470 --> 20:26.393
You look, just as beautiful as I remember.

20:29.447 --> 20:31.330
Some party, huh?

20:31.330 --> 20:34.173
- Egypt, OMG, how are you?

20:37.829 --> 20:39.423
I love your skirt.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.753
- Claudia, you're here.

20:46.260 --> 20:49.400
I'm sorry, did you two come
together, or is it just

20:49.400 --> 20:51.790
a coincidence that you
showed up at the same time?

20:51.790 --> 20:53.364
- Hi, Claudia.

20:56.190 --> 20:57.909
You guys look great.

20:57.909 --> 21:00.360
OMG, this is beautiful.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.636
- Thank you.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.760
- I thought you guys were crazy to run off

21:02.760 --> 21:04.170
and get married the way you did, but

21:04.170 --> 21:05.260
looks like it all worked out.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.922
I am so happy for you both.

21:07.922 --> 21:11.090
- Me too, I think we should celebrate.

21:11.090 --> 21:12.670
I'm gonna get us some shots.

21:12.670 --> 21:16.793
And will you help me
with that in the kitchen?

21:17.993 --> 21:21.413
- Hey, baby, I'll be right
back, would you like anything?

21:21.413 --> 21:23.413
- Just hurry back to me.

21:24.937 --> 21:26.437
- So married life?

21:28.018 --> 21:30.486
- Y'all having a good time?

21:30.486 --> 21:32.594
I said, are you y'all having a good time?

21:34.216 --> 21:36.929
I'm gonna take you back to 2006.

21:42.552 --> 21:43.969
- What's up, man?

21:48.146 --> 21:49.887
- So what are we toasting to?

21:49.887 --> 21:51.180
- Old friends.

21:51.180 --> 21:54.950
- Old? Speak for yourself,
I look damn good.

22:06.113 --> 22:08.650
- Her butt is so big, it was like--

22:08.650 --> 22:10.210
- Claudia, remember me?

22:10.210 --> 22:12.373
- Oh my God, I'll see
you later, I'm sorry.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.257
Hey, Chiggy, oh my God.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.650
- So, Alex, how's life?

22:19.650 --> 22:21.573
- Life's good, no complaints.

22:22.610 --> 22:24.277
How about you, who's the lucky guy

22:24.277 --> 22:26.950
that's responsible for this glow I see?

22:26.950 --> 22:28.260
- There's a guy.

22:28.260 --> 22:29.103
He's tall.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.500
Handsome, but he's married.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.303
But I do tend to glow when he's around.

22:37.540 --> 22:38.490
- I miss you too.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.935
- How are you?

22:39.935 --> 22:42.042
- I'm good, good, you smell good.

22:42.042 --> 22:43.042
- Thank you.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.840
Wow, what a great party,
and thanks for inviting us.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.080
- Don't mention it.

22:49.630 --> 22:52.353
It's always good to see
how much you've, grown.

22:54.470 --> 22:56.844
- God, we're not 17 or 18 anymore.

22:56.844 --> 22:59.340
- No we're not, no we are not.

23:00.273 --> 23:01.310
Damn girl.

23:01.310 --> 23:04.680
- God, you're too much, oh my God.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.310
- So how's married life?

23:06.310 --> 23:08.910
Are you starting to regret
choosing her over me yet?

23:10.670 --> 23:12.920
- See that's what I admire about you.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.025
Never afraid to say what's on your mind.

23:15.025 --> 23:16.243
- You didn't answer my question.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.590
- Married life's good, no complaints,

23:20.590 --> 23:21.803
no drama.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.220
Claudia keeps the castle intact.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.490
I think most people would
say I live like a king.

23:26.490 --> 23:27.590
- And what do you say?

23:28.630 --> 23:31.933
- I'd say after everything
I've done, I'm one lucky guy.

23:33.283 --> 23:34.533
- Good for you.

23:35.850 --> 23:37.333
What?

23:37.333 --> 23:38.960
- I'll always love you, Egypt.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.630
- Just go back to the party.

23:40.630 --> 23:43.163
- Hey, I'm here, I'm
listening, talk to me.

23:44.747 --> 23:46.872
- You know, I always thought you were one

23:46.872 --> 23:47.890
of the prettiest girls in school, right?

23:47.890 --> 23:49.243
- Oh stop.

23:50.203 --> 23:51.570
- I tell the truth.

23:51.570 --> 23:54.470
- Well I thought you
were too high to notice.

23:54.470 --> 23:57.580
- Some things are
much too big not to notice.

23:57.580 --> 23:58.964
- You're silly.

23:58.964 --> 23:59.797
- Hoo.

23:59.797 --> 24:02.476
- I can't do this right now, Alex.

24:02.476 --> 24:04.273
- You know how I feel about you.

24:04.273 --> 24:07.080
- I can't keep doing this
back and forth thing,

24:07.080 --> 24:09.030
especially after what happened in Miami.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.214
Does she even know?

24:10.214 --> 24:12.047
- She doesn't need to.

24:13.278 --> 24:17.610
That was our special
time, just me and you.

24:17.610 --> 24:19.953
- Maybe you can be like that, but I can't.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.524
- What are you saying, Egypt?

24:23.524 --> 24:25.790
- You've played the fence for so long.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.240
I'm done.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.509
I have feelings too, Alex.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.680
- So what, are these house
parties paying your bills?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.184
- They used to.

24:43.184 --> 24:45.380
Til I signed with Max Money Records.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.213
- Shut up.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.368
The Max Money?

24:48.368 --> 24:49.920
- Uh-huh.
- Liar.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.233
- Alexander Wallace.

24:53.210 --> 24:54.710
My my, how fine you've gotten.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.905
Do you wanna dance?

25:03.720 --> 25:04.740
- They loved my demo.

25:04.740 --> 25:05.573
- You're lying.

25:05.573 --> 25:07.520
- And signed me a check right on the spot.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.150
- No way, no, no no no no no.

25:10.150 --> 25:11.253
That's huge.

25:12.216 --> 25:13.049
Oh my God.

25:14.450 --> 25:16.343
- How about you let me spend
some of this money on you?

25:19.550 --> 25:21.750
- Why don't we go to a
quiet place and talk?

25:23.588 --> 25:25.171
- Come on.

25:35.761 --> 25:36.761
- Hell yeah.

25:39.529 --> 25:42.152
Rack 'em up, let's go.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.084
- You got this, you
got this, you got this.

25:48.084 --> 25:49.382
It's all right, let's go, let's go.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.215
- Oh.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.546
- Calm down, calm down, let's go, come on.

25:56.559 --> 25:57.476
- Let's go.

25:58.707 --> 25:59.540
Drink it.

26:01.905 --> 26:02.738
- Ahhhh.

26:17.062 --> 26:18.395
- Really?

26:19.873 --> 26:22.956
- You can do it, bad boy, you got it.

26:25.996 --> 26:29.763
- Damn , get that.

26:34.187 --> 26:36.143
- I like this, that's right, boy.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.760
- Yes, domino, ha ha, ha ha ha, ha.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.710
- How does he keep it doing that?

26:52.710 --> 26:56.050
- Calm down, look, domino is
not a game of skill, okay?

26:56.050 --> 26:57.620
It's a simple logarithm.

26:57.620 --> 27:00.710
- Translation, Alex, he
counts dominoes, and cards.

27:00.710 --> 27:03.290
That's why I don't play games with you.

27:03.290 --> 27:05.180
- Really? Right under the bus.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.460
Just lay me there, head-first, whoop.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.023
- My pleasure, cheater.

27:10.330 --> 27:11.163
- Pam.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.490
- Egypt, look girl,
mimosas, my place, this weekend.

27:14.490 --> 27:16.187
- Yes, of course, I'm so there.

27:16.187 --> 27:18.213
- All right, bye.

27:18.213 --> 27:20.570
- Hey, was that Pamela Walker?

27:20.570 --> 27:21.500
- Yeah.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.790
- How'd that happen?

27:22.790 --> 27:24.970
You two used to fight like
every week in high school,

27:24.970 --> 27:26.480
and now you're besties.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.930
- No, we actually went to
the same acting program,

27:29.930 --> 27:31.830
like the first two years of college.

27:31.830 --> 27:33.690
She's really cool, we got pretty close.

27:33.690 --> 27:36.430
- Maturity speaks volumes
of a person's character.

27:36.430 --> 27:38.162
Good for you, Egypt.

27:38.162 --> 27:38.995
- What are you trying to say, John?

27:38.995 --> 27:41.590
That I didn't have any
character back in the day?

27:41.590 --> 27:43.743
- Don't answer that, John, trust me.

27:44.669 --> 27:45.502
- What?

27:46.821 --> 27:48.643
- And then there was four.

27:48.643 --> 27:49.640
- Chiggy.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.550
- Wait, are we really
the only ones still here?

27:52.550 --> 27:54.600
- Yeah, just about.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.470
Alex, you lucky bastard.

27:57.470 --> 27:58.810
- Why's that, Chig?

27:58.810 --> 28:01.070
- You know Claudia's amazing, right?

28:01.070 --> 28:02.830
She's in the kitchen
right now cleaning up,

28:02.830 --> 28:04.283
and she's fine with it.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.780
Y'all two gotta stay here til she's done.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.550
- Well I'll tell you something, Chiggy.

28:09.550 --> 28:11.180
I'm not cleaning shit.

28:11.180 --> 28:13.370
In fact, you can go get me another drink.

28:13.370 --> 28:15.610
And none of that cheap shit
you were giving everyone else.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.010
I know you've got a bottle of Gray Goose

28:17.010 --> 28:18.940
somewhere in this house.

28:18.940 --> 28:19.773
- Fine, Egypt.

28:21.002 --> 28:22.330
Y'all want something else?

28:22.330 --> 28:23.163
- No thanks.

28:23.163 --> 28:25.450
- Yeah, I'll take
whatever you bring, Egypt.

28:25.450 --> 28:26.920
- Me too.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.680
Don't normally drink, but tonight

28:28.680 --> 28:31.305
is a exception, right?

28:31.305 --> 28:32.734
- Okay.

28:32.734 --> 28:33.905
- My man.

28:33.905 --> 28:35.400
- Thanks, Chig.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.214
- All right, wanna play another game?

28:37.214 --> 28:38.868
- Let's do it.

28:38.868 --> 28:42.283
♪ I wanna dance with somebody ♪

28:42.283 --> 28:45.116
♪ I wanna eat wit ♪

28:46.457 --> 28:47.862
- Fuck.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.013
Really?

28:59.130 --> 29:00.880
What are you trying to do, hmm?

29:02.852 --> 29:04.327
Please.

29:20.693 --> 29:21.807
- Hi, guys.

29:21.807 --> 29:22.865
- Hi.

29:22.865 --> 29:23.940
- All right, baby, well I think I'm gonna

29:23.940 --> 29:25.640
go use the little girls' room.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.824
I'll be right back, okay?

29:33.780 --> 29:36.780
- Where the hell have you been?

29:36.780 --> 29:37.780
- Can't say.

29:38.630 --> 29:39.648
You know what I mean?

29:39.648 --> 29:40.937
- No, we don't know what you mean, Rashad,

29:40.937 --> 29:43.203
but please, feel free to enlighten us.

29:44.273 --> 29:46.231
- Get the fuck outta my business.

29:46.231 --> 29:48.690
Yo, y'all playing dominoes, who got next?

29:48.690 --> 29:50.180
- Yeah, we're playing,
but you don't wanna play

29:50.180 --> 29:52.560
with Bill Nye over
here, because he cheats.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.880
- Yeah, I forgot
he counts cards and shit.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.178
- Wait, you knew that?

29:57.178 --> 29:58.170
- Yeah, of course.

29:58.170 --> 29:59.943
I mean, sure, he loves dice too.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.390
Yeah, he helped me get like $600

30:04.390 --> 30:06.894
back in high school for basketball.

30:06.894 --> 30:07.727
- What?

30:07.727 --> 30:09.440
- You little embezzler.

30:10.470 --> 30:13.680
- Oh, babes, we were children then.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.030
I'm an honest man now.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.303
- Yeah, right.
- Okay.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.680
- Rashad?

30:26.680 --> 30:27.661
- What's up, man?

30:27.661 --> 30:28.607
- I got an idea.

30:28.607 --> 30:30.900
You down for a couple rounds of Todd?

30:30.900 --> 30:32.780
- Yeah, let's do it.

30:32.780 --> 30:35.000
Let's go, I haven't played
that in years, let's do it.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.410
- Wait, who the hell is Todd?

30:36.410 --> 30:37.763
- It's not who, E.

30:38.755 --> 30:40.110
- It's a what, it's a game.

30:40.110 --> 30:42.570
Me and Alex used to play
Truth or Double Dare

30:42.570 --> 30:43.700
back when we were kids.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.840
Mother caught us doing a couple of things

30:45.840 --> 30:47.460
that didn't work out,
that's just, you know.

30:47.460 --> 30:48.610
So we had to change it up.

30:48.610 --> 30:50.210
So we called it Todd, get it?

30:50.210 --> 30:51.570
- Oh you're so lame.

30:51.570 --> 30:54.457
Wait, where the hell is
Chiggy with my drink?

30:57.110 --> 31:00.366
- Please, wait.

31:05.590 --> 31:08.047
- Yeah, guys, aren't we a little
old to play Truth or Dare?

31:08.047 --> 31:11.060
Why don't we just like drink
and watch a movie or something?

31:11.060 --> 31:13.030
- Michelle, shut up.

31:13.030 --> 31:14.570
This could actually be fun.

31:14.570 --> 31:16.490
- Yeah, my girl, so let
me tell you the rules.

31:16.490 --> 31:18.510
All right, so first
round, double dare only.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.770
Gotta dare someone to do something,

31:19.770 --> 31:21.150
and they have to do it.

31:21.150 --> 31:24.020
If they don't do it, then
guess what, they're out.

31:24.020 --> 31:25.380
First person dares the next person,

31:25.380 --> 31:27.290
that person, so on and so forth.

31:27.290 --> 31:28.990
Second round, truth.

31:28.990 --> 31:30.700
Guess what, you gotta tell the truth,

31:30.700 --> 31:32.030
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

31:32.030 --> 31:33.496
and if we catch you lying,

31:33.496 --> 31:35.218
let them know what they won, Alex.

31:35.218 --> 31:36.390
You take a shot.

31:36.390 --> 31:38.020
All right, easy?

31:38.020 --> 31:39.690
- Easy enough for me.

31:39.690 --> 31:40.850
- Drinks, everybody.

31:40.850 --> 31:41.693
- Ah, thank you.

31:42.661 --> 31:43.494
There you go.

31:43.494 --> 31:45.850
Hey, baby, you wanna play a couple rounds

31:45.850 --> 31:47.390
of Truth or Double Dare with us?

31:47.390 --> 31:48.797
- Yeah, deal me in.

31:50.168 --> 31:52.217
- It's not a card game, babe.

31:52.217 --> 31:53.387
- Oh.

31:53.387 --> 31:54.554
- That's okay.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.088
- Alex, the double dare's on you.

32:09.088 --> 32:11.081
- All right, let's go.

32:11.081 --> 32:12.530
- I dare you to

32:13.840 --> 32:14.673
kiss me.

32:15.770 --> 32:17.210
- No way.

32:17.210 --> 32:19.200
Egypt, you're playing dirty, no.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.360
- Babe, it's only Egypt, who cares?

32:22.360 --> 32:24.093
- Yeah, Alex, it's just me.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.750
- Ohhhh.

32:35.750 --> 32:36.653
- Not cool, guys.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.410
- Calm down, baby, it's
okay, it's only a kiss.

32:42.410 --> 32:45.240
- Okay, fine, we're gonna
play dirty, let's play dirty.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.920
Michelle, the double dare is on you.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.170
- Fine, what you got?

32:49.170 --> 32:50.003
- All right.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.210
I double dare you

32:53.500 --> 32:56.767
to grab Egypt's ass and squeeze it.

32:56.767 --> 32:57.913
- I like that kinky stuff.

32:57.913 --> 32:59.960
- Seriously, Alex, I didn't
dare you to kiss her.

32:59.960 --> 33:03.222
- Yeah, well, you laughed,
so go ahead and squeeze it.

33:03.222 --> 33:04.055
Whooo.

33:05.830 --> 33:07.009
- You're a pervert.

33:07.009 --> 33:07.950
- Me, no.

33:07.950 --> 33:12.530
- Claudia, I double dare
you to grab Alex's testicles

33:12.530 --> 33:14.997
and squeeze until he screams.

33:14.997 --> 33:17.547
- Foul play, that's bullshit,
Michelle, and you know it.

33:17.547 --> 33:19.992
- Rules are rules, ready, babe?

33:19.992 --> 33:22.299
- Yeah, if
you would be so kind.

33:26.157 --> 33:29.195
- Damn, baby, you've
been waiting to do that.

33:30.589 --> 33:32.890
- I don't wanna get into.

33:32.890 --> 33:36.563
Okay, so I choose, John.

33:37.430 --> 33:38.263
- Bring it.

33:40.610 --> 33:44.690
- I double dare you to
tell us one of Michelle's

33:44.690 --> 33:46.240
dirty little secrets.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.387
- Oh, now this is interesting.

33:48.387 --> 33:49.703
- I'm not gonna do that.

33:49.703 --> 33:51.388
- He's not gonna do that.

33:51.388 --> 33:53.239
- Yes you can.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.111
- Let's go.

33:54.111 --> 33:54.944
- You heard the rules.

33:54.944 --> 33:58.730
- Fine, Michelle was
arrested three years ago.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.060
I'm not gonna say why,

34:00.060 --> 34:01.990
but just know that she was.

34:01.990 --> 34:03.420
- Girl gone bad.

34:03.420 --> 34:04.253
- Yeah, my God.

34:04.253 --> 34:06.050
- Michelle, I never
knew you had it in you.

34:06.050 --> 34:07.750
- Fuck that, what happened?

34:07.750 --> 34:09.989
- Egypt, the dare was to tell
a secret, not the details.

34:09.989 --> 34:11.739
- You're such a wimp.

34:11.739 --> 34:13.909
- Look, if Michelle wants
to tell you, she will, okay?

34:13.909 --> 34:15.263
- Mr. Fine Print.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.723
- That just leaves Shad.

34:19.760 --> 34:20.650
- What you got, man?

34:20.650 --> 34:22.902
- Okay, I, uh,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.870
I double dare you

34:27.870 --> 34:29.605
to kiss the green machine.

34:29.605 --> 34:30.730
- Oh hell no, hell no.

34:30.730 --> 34:31.810
- Oh my God.

34:31.810 --> 34:35.120
- Just a little nickname that
we gave Claudia's big toe

34:35.120 --> 34:37.362
when she caught gangrene.

34:39.498 --> 34:41.761
- That's cold.

34:41.761 --> 34:43.255
- Oh my God, that's like 10 years ago.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.373
Can we be over it?

34:44.373 --> 34:45.460
- I admit, it's awful
that he called it that.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.815
So that's why I think this would be a good

34:47.815 --> 34:48.649
opportunity for a little retribution.

34:48.649 --> 34:49.719
- John, Ima kill you.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.000
- I agree with John.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.110
You were a little prick to me.

34:52.110 --> 34:52.963
- Whip it out.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.902
- Shad, Shad, Shad.

34:55.955 --> 34:58.427
- Shad, Shad, Shad, Shad,

34:58.427 --> 35:00.344
Shad, Shad, Shad, Shad.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.730
- Come on, Claudia, you're taking forever.

35:07.143 --> 35:08.407
Oh, oh, oh.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.160
- Where's Chiggy, I need another drink.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.563
- Me too, Chiggy.

35:16.998 --> 35:18.493
- I have beautiful toes now.

35:20.843 --> 35:21.676
- Now what?

35:21.676 --> 35:22.590
- Yeah, who's next?

35:23.792 --> 35:25.092
- It's Shad's turn.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.990
- Oh my God!

35:29.990 --> 35:31.510
Oh my God.

35:31.510 --> 35:32.970
- What is it?

35:36.267 --> 35:37.370
- What the fuck?

35:37.370 --> 35:38.203
- He's not breathing.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.036
- What do you mean he's not breathing?

35:39.036 --> 35:40.480
- Michelle, he's not breathing?

35:40.480 --> 35:41.900
Someone call 911.

35:41.900 --> 35:43.831
- Where are the phones?

35:47.642 --> 35:49.262
- What is it?

35:49.262 --> 35:52.713
- It's time for Round Two, Truth.

35:54.530 --> 35:55.880
If you don't play, you die.

36:06.279 --> 36:08.467
- Who's got a phone?

36:08.467 --> 36:10.510
- Chiggy has a phone.

36:10.510 --> 36:11.990
Answer it, answer it.

36:19.700 --> 36:23.548
- Are you ready to play?

36:23.548 --> 36:25.550
- Who the fuck is this?

36:25.550 --> 36:28.406
- If you leave, you die.

36:28.406 --> 36:31.356
Go sit at the table and get ready to play.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.051
- I'm out, man, I'm gone, I'm sorry.

36:33.051 --> 36:34.816
- Rashad, no, you heard what they said.

36:34.816 --> 36:36.169
If you leave, you die.

36:36.169 --> 36:37.004
- I'm gonna go get him.

36:50.895 --> 36:54.935
- This isn't real, this
isn't real, I pray to God.

37:31.835 --> 37:34.242
- You play, you live.

37:34.242 --> 37:35.909
If you lie, you die.

37:37.071 --> 37:37.904
Who wants to go first?

37:37.904 --> 37:40.076
- You're fucking sick.

37:40.076 --> 37:42.670
- Egypt, does Rashad know

37:42.670 --> 37:45.063
why he didn't make the
college basketball team?

37:46.754 --> 37:47.833
- Bitch.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.340
- Tell him, Egypt.

37:49.340 --> 37:50.343
If you lie, you die.

37:51.300 --> 37:54.467
The clock is ticking, you have one minute.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.390
- What's he talking about, E?

37:57.390 --> 37:58.223
- Man, listen,

37:59.630 --> 38:00.730
check this out, man.

38:00.730 --> 38:01.563
- All right.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.370
- I got a scholarship,
full ride, North Carolina.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.220
- Bro, seriously?

38:06.220 --> 38:07.223
- Yes, sir.

38:10.420 --> 38:11.523
- E, I know you can fucking hear me.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.340
What the fuck is he talking about, E?

38:13.340 --> 38:17.007
- Tell him, E, he said
one minute, just tell him.

38:17.007 --> 38:17.943
- Fine.

38:18.920 --> 38:21.694
I told Coach Corey you
were taking steroids.

38:21.694 --> 38:22.620
There it is.

38:22.620 --> 38:23.453
There it is.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.170
- Why'd you fucking do that?

38:27.170 --> 38:29.355
My fucking life depended
on that scholarship,

38:29.355 --> 38:32.311
and you fucking ratted me out.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.730
- Please.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.400
You were the one that
sold me to your teammate

38:36.400 --> 38:38.970
for those pills in the first place.

38:38.970 --> 38:40.723
- All right, so you want in on this?

38:41.740 --> 38:42.573
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:43.590 --> 38:44.760
- Yeah, how much?

38:44.760 --> 38:46.220
- No, it don't work like that.

38:46.220 --> 38:48.020
I got a guy, I gotta give him a call.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.363
But first,

38:52.310 --> 38:54.660
you gotta do something for your boy.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.430
- What's that, man, anything.

38:56.430 --> 38:57.990
Let's do it.

38:57.990 --> 38:59.290
- Juan told me everything.

39:01.190 --> 39:02.514
After he raped me.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.482
- What?
- What?

39:04.482 --> 39:06.891
- Yeah, Alex, Juan.

39:06.891 --> 39:09.833
He raped me.

39:09.833 --> 39:12.362
- I didn't know that, I didn't.

39:12.362 --> 39:15.340
- You only care about yourself.

39:15.340 --> 39:17.790
You don't care about anybody else.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.620
Did you ever bother asking why I was

39:20.620 --> 39:23.053
so crucial to that transaction?

39:24.630 --> 39:26.220
Of course you didn't.

39:26.220 --> 39:30.730
Screw you, Rashad, I'm
glad you got rejected.

39:34.802 --> 39:35.802
- The phone.

39:37.211 --> 39:38.211
- Answer it.

39:40.055 --> 39:42.755
- Very good, Egypt.

39:42.755 --> 39:45.503
Now you, my dear, get to
choose the next player.

39:45.503 --> 39:48.200
You have five seconds to decide.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.117
Five, four.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.484
- Come on, come on!

39:51.484 --> 39:52.641
- Fine.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.488
- Two.

39:53.488 --> 39:54.826
- Claudia.

39:57.198 --> 40:00.686
- The
plot thickens, Claudia.

40:00.686 --> 40:03.478
Alex doesn't know about
Dr. Lemmon, does he?

40:03.478 --> 40:06.641
But tell Alex why you
went to see Dr. Lemmon.

40:06.641 --> 40:08.221
The clock starts now.

40:08.221 --> 40:10.330
- Who's Dr. Lemmon.

40:10.330 --> 40:12.632
Baby, we don't have
much time, just tell me!

40:12.632 --> 40:13.465
- Okay.

40:15.463 --> 40:18.030
- There's nothing you could
have done to justify this.

40:18.030 --> 40:19.213
Your father is a dick.

40:19.213 --> 40:20.719
- I'm pregnant.

40:25.710 --> 40:26.543
That's when,

40:27.696 --> 40:30.420
that's when he got mad and just

40:30.420 --> 40:32.150
hit me, but it wasn't bad.

40:32.150 --> 40:33.363
It was just.

40:35.870 --> 40:36.943
- Fuck your father!

40:38.790 --> 40:41.203
You never have to go back there again.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.720
- Two months after we got married,

40:43.720 --> 40:46.273
I found out about you and Egypt.

40:48.570 --> 40:52.043
And I just, I was so mad and angry, I.

40:55.110 --> 40:56.010
I got an abortion.

40:57.999 --> 40:58.832
- Claudia.

41:01.523 --> 41:02.440
You didn't.

41:03.874 --> 41:06.710
- Alex, you were sleeping with that tramp

41:06.710 --> 41:09.350
for the first five years of our marriage.

41:09.350 --> 41:12.270
And then you lied about that
business deal in New York.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.730
I knew you were in Miami with her.

41:14.730 --> 41:16.810
You charged the room reservations

41:16.810 --> 41:18.673
under my credit card, you idiot.

41:20.085 --> 41:20.918
- Baby.

41:20.918 --> 41:21.903
- Don't baby me.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.233
And you even checked in
under Mr. and Mrs. Wallace.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.690
And you lied to me about
those business meetings

41:32.690 --> 41:33.860
and those late nights.

41:33.860 --> 41:36.160
Tell me this, tell me, babe.

41:37.206 --> 41:40.683
When you called me to say I love you,

41:40.683 --> 41:43.979
were you laying in bed next to her?

41:43.979 --> 41:46.712
Were you guys laughing at me?

41:46.712 --> 41:47.545
- No.

41:48.746 --> 41:49.579
- Claudia.

41:49.579 --> 41:53.753
- Get the fuck, bitch, you
have nothing to say to me.

41:54.747 --> 41:57.336
Nothing is holding me back
from kicking your fucking ass.

41:57.336 --> 41:59.062
- Please, calm down.

42:01.760 --> 42:02.593
Stop.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.592
- Oh God, no.

42:09.592 --> 42:10.425
Answer it.

42:11.891 --> 42:14.791
- Well played, Claudia.

42:14.791 --> 42:17.908
Now you get to choose, who will it be?

42:17.908 --> 42:19.015
Five seconds.

42:19.015 --> 42:21.068
- Claudia, no.

42:21.068 --> 42:23.157
- Five, four,

42:23.157 --> 42:24.157
three.

42:24.157 --> 42:24.990
- John.

42:26.197 --> 42:29.730
- Oh, ho,
that one will switch the mood.

42:29.730 --> 42:34.520
Jonathan, you're a good guy,
but you are not perfect.

42:34.520 --> 42:35.770
Does Michelle know how you got

42:35.770 --> 42:38.160
that letter of recommendation?

42:38.160 --> 42:41.256
Tell her, John, the clock starts now.

42:41.256 --> 42:42.089
- No!

42:44.880 --> 42:46.660
- Baby, nothing's gonna change us.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.861
Just tell me.

42:48.861 --> 42:49.694
Just.

42:50.697 --> 42:52.830
- I can't talk about that, Shell.

42:52.830 --> 42:54.320
- Baby.
- I can't!

42:54.320 --> 42:57.403
- Come on, nothing's gonna
change us, just tell me.

43:01.720 --> 43:05.460
- Your father knew how much I wanted that

43:06.730 --> 43:08.443
Ivy League college education.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.540
And I knew how much a
recommendation from him would do

43:12.540 --> 43:14.970
for getting me that acceptance letter.

43:14.970 --> 43:16.880
- Whatever, parents love to boast.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.533
I'm sure if we asked your father,

43:20.080 --> 43:23.730
Dr. Curtis, about your
academic accomplishments,

43:23.730 --> 43:26.450
he'd give some long, intellectual lecture

43:26.450 --> 43:28.800
about the brilliance of
his beautiful daughter.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.740
My only concern is
getting past graduation,

43:32.740 --> 43:37.720
so I can focus on more important things.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.840
- It's okay.

43:38.840 --> 43:42.433
- So, I let him.

43:44.694 --> 43:45.527
- What?

43:46.380 --> 43:47.430
Just say it.

43:47.430 --> 43:50.012
- Your father performed oral sex on me.

43:50.012 --> 43:50.845
- What?

43:54.210 --> 43:55.770
- I know what that sounds like, babe,

43:55.770 --> 43:58.753
but it's not like that, okay?

44:01.179 --> 44:02.923
- You, you're fucking,

44:03.822 --> 44:06.108
you're sick, you are sick.

44:06.108 --> 44:07.153
You never even cared about me,

44:07.153 --> 44:09.903
because you just cared about
the benefits of dating me.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.393
- It's getting late.

44:13.930 --> 44:16.920
We're having a dinner tomorrow night,

44:16.920 --> 44:19.337
and I was wondering if you
and Dr. Curtis could come.

44:19.337 --> 44:20.723
It's a big family dinner.

44:21.980 --> 44:25.320
- Yeah, I'd love to,
just text me the details.

44:25.320 --> 44:26.781
We'll be there.

44:26.781 --> 44:28.800
- No wonder my father,

44:28.800 --> 44:31.023
wait, wait, wait wait, wait.

44:31.924 --> 44:33.794
That's not the only time it happened.

44:33.794 --> 44:34.883
Is it?

44:34.883 --> 44:36.435
Oh my God.

44:36.435 --> 44:37.990
- Michelle, it's not like
I enjoyed it or something.

44:37.990 --> 44:39.980
The first time it happened,
your father blackmailed me,

44:39.980 --> 44:42.060
all right, and I was
afraid that if I stopped,

44:42.060 --> 44:44.720
he would tell you, okay,
and I didn't wanna lose you.

44:44.720 --> 44:45.855
- So you were just gonna,

44:45.855 --> 44:48.005
you were just gonna
keep letting it happen?

44:48.960 --> 44:53.147
Is that why we've never
been able to do it?

44:55.336 --> 44:57.636
You told me you wanted
to wait until marriage.

44:58.580 --> 45:02.110
You just wanted to trap me,
and then tell me, is that it?

45:02.110 --> 45:04.728
- I swear, baby, that's
not what it's like.

45:07.721 --> 45:09.174
What do you want, you son of a bitch?

45:09.174 --> 45:10.007
What do you want with us?

45:10.007 --> 45:11.967
- I want the truth.

45:11.967 --> 45:13.990
- I'm not playing anymore, all right.

45:13.990 --> 45:15.020
I'm not picking anyone.

45:15.020 --> 45:16.257
- You have five seconds.

45:16.257 --> 45:17.090
- John no.

45:47.438 --> 45:48.355
- Michelle?

45:50.184 --> 45:51.017
Oh, shit.

45:53.063 --> 45:53.896
Help!

45:55.495 --> 45:58.218
- Where's John, where's John, oh no.

45:58.218 --> 45:59.151
What am I gonna do?

45:59.151 --> 46:00.033
- We have to find John.

46:00.033 --> 46:01.616
- Help, help, help!

46:02.671 --> 46:03.504
Help!

46:04.585 --> 46:05.418
Let go.

46:06.328 --> 46:07.228
No.

46:08.242 --> 46:09.520
- I don't know who this
piece of shit is, man,

46:09.520 --> 46:10.870
but he can't kill us all at the same time.

46:10.870 --> 46:12.243
Listen, I say we all bail out

46:12.243 --> 46:14.698
and get the fuck outta here, yo.

46:14.698 --> 46:16.130
- Are you insane?

46:16.130 --> 46:16.963
- Let's go.

46:16.963 --> 46:18.163
- We are not leaving John like that!

46:18.163 --> 46:20.130
- Fuck that, John left us!

46:20.130 --> 46:21.897
- Egypt was right about you.

46:21.897 --> 46:23.781
All you do is think about yourself.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.752
- Come on, man.

46:25.752 --> 46:26.898
- Listen!

46:36.503 --> 46:39.670
There's three rooms
downstairs, two rooms upstairs.

46:39.670 --> 46:41.580
Rashad and I will take downstairs.

46:41.580 --> 46:44.900
You three go upstairs,
check the rooms, be careful,

46:44.900 --> 46:46.459
stay together.

46:46.459 --> 46:47.343
- We can't split, we can't.

46:48.206 --> 46:49.542
No.

46:49.542 --> 46:52.165
- Listen to me, listen to me, listen.

46:52.165 --> 46:54.311
When we get outta here,
I promise, I promise,

46:54.311 --> 46:56.101
I'll make everything up to you.

46:56.101 --> 46:57.640
- No.

46:57.640 --> 46:58.742
Babe, I don't wanna.

46:58.742 --> 47:01.341
- Let's go, go, go, go.

47:19.196 --> 47:20.688
- Shhh.

47:20.688 --> 47:21.521
- Let's go back.

47:22.644 --> 47:24.041
Come on.

47:36.310 --> 47:37.790
- You guys get
the rest of the rooms.

47:37.790 --> 47:40.300
- No, they
told us not to split up.

47:40.300 --> 47:42.720
- The quicker we do this,
the quicker we can leave.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.730
- She's right.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.850
Just check there, I'll check there.

47:45.850 --> 47:48.034
- We'll meet right here when you're done.

47:48.034 --> 47:49.181
- Come on.

47:49.181 --> 47:50.384
- Okay.

49:01.883 --> 49:03.283
- Shad, find a light.

49:08.820 --> 49:09.653
John?

49:13.947 --> 49:15.602
- It's time to go, it's time to go.

49:15.602 --> 49:17.100
Let's go, Alex, come on, man.

49:17.100 --> 49:18.729
- We can't just leave him like that.

49:18.729 --> 49:19.562
- What the fuck you mean?

49:19.562 --> 49:22.510
He left us first, he
fucking left us first.

49:22.510 --> 49:23.460
- We gotta figure something out.

49:23.460 --> 49:26.597
- He's fucking dead, what the
fuck is there to figure out?

49:26.597 --> 49:27.820
Why the fuck do you always have to be

49:27.820 --> 49:29.060
the hero all the time, Alex?

49:29.060 --> 49:30.263
Let's fucking go!

49:32.613 --> 49:34.280
I'm outta here, man.

49:39.974 --> 49:41.482
- I'm sorry, John.

50:57.739 --> 51:01.093
- Shh, shh, it's just me, come on.

51:01.093 --> 51:03.556
- Oh my God, oh my God.

51:03.556 --> 51:05.402
Michelle, where's Egypt?

51:05.402 --> 51:06.719
- In the other room.

51:06.719 --> 51:08.484
Let's go find the guys.

51:08.484 --> 51:09.440
They probably have John by now.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.273
- Oh God.

51:11.972 --> 51:12.872
- I'm sorry, John.

51:16.147 --> 51:16.980
Rashad!

51:21.074 --> 51:23.980
- Shh, where are they?

51:23.980 --> 51:25.381
Egypt?

51:25.381 --> 51:26.214
Where are they?

51:29.860 --> 51:30.693
Oh my God.

51:53.973 --> 51:55.140
Oh my God, no!

51:58.856 --> 51:59.693
- Michelle, thank God.

51:59.693 --> 52:01.490
Where's Claudia?

52:01.490 --> 52:02.431
Where's Claudia?

52:02.431 --> 52:03.534
- The killer got her.

52:03.534 --> 52:04.367
I'm sorry.

52:05.323 --> 52:06.156
I'm sorry.

52:12.757 --> 52:13.973
Did you find John?

52:14.850 --> 52:16.232
Where's John?

52:16.232 --> 52:17.149
Is he okay?

52:18.078 --> 52:21.004
- I'm sorry, John didn't make it.

52:21.004 --> 52:22.832
- No.
- I'm sorry, Michelle.

52:22.832 --> 52:23.761
- I'm so sorry.

52:23.761 --> 52:25.327
- Oh God, John.

52:25.327 --> 52:26.160
No.

52:30.512 --> 52:32.422
- Look at me, look at me.

52:32.422 --> 52:35.202
We gotta get it together,
okay, we gotta get out of here.

52:35.202 --> 52:36.706
Okay, look at me.

52:36.706 --> 52:37.803
- You ready?
- Yeah.

52:37.803 --> 52:39.133
- Okay, let's go.

52:58.321 --> 52:59.154
- Alex.

53:12.502 --> 53:13.419
- Who? Why?

53:22.469 --> 53:23.302
- Ta-da!

53:25.380 --> 53:28.700
- Alex, why couldn't you just love me,

53:28.700 --> 53:30.093
the way I loved you?

53:31.150 --> 53:33.009
I gave you all of me.

53:33.009 --> 53:33.842
- All of her.

53:33.842 --> 53:34.675
- And you abused it.

53:34.675 --> 53:37.480
- Mm-mm-mm, ain't that a shame?

53:37.480 --> 53:39.092
- I loved you, Egypt.

53:39.092 --> 53:40.793
- Yeah, you loved me.

53:42.487 --> 53:43.837
But you loved Claudia more.

53:47.077 --> 53:48.577
- Mmm, right in the dick, son.

53:49.734 --> 53:51.007
That's gotta hurt.

53:51.007 --> 53:53.850
- And I was hoping Claudia would be last.

53:53.850 --> 53:55.810
I had so much to say to her.

53:55.810 --> 53:57.690
- You and Alex have to stop.

53:57.690 --> 53:59.610
I don't wanna be around
when Claudia finds out.

53:59.610 --> 54:00.490
- What do you mean when?

54:00.490 --> 54:01.607
She's not gonna find out.

54:01.607 --> 54:03.700
And by the way, Alex was mine first.

54:03.700 --> 54:05.880
I go away to alternative
school for two weeks,

54:05.880 --> 54:07.430
and when I come back, they're together.

54:07.430 --> 54:10.260
She does not get to take
Alex from me like that.

54:10.260 --> 54:11.470
- How?

54:11.470 --> 54:14.920
We thought you were dead
when we couldn't find you.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.958
What?

54:15.958 --> 54:18.563
- An easy mind is so easy to trick.

54:19.610 --> 54:21.253
And I do mean easy.

54:22.480 --> 54:23.333
- Ha ha ha.

54:28.478 --> 54:30.500
- What did we ever do to you?

54:30.500 --> 54:33.200
- Did I ever tell you that
Alex and I eloped in Miami?

54:34.690 --> 54:38.346
He was gonna leave her, but he didn't.

54:38.346 --> 54:39.179
- Nope.

54:39.179 --> 54:41.250
- He went back to her, and then,

54:41.250 --> 54:44.083
he calls me to tell me
that he made a mistake.

54:45.380 --> 54:49.190
I loved Alex more than
anything in the entire world,

54:49.190 --> 54:50.050
and he used me.

54:50.050 --> 54:52.093
- Like a dirty dog, mmm.

54:53.490 --> 54:56.760
- And, Rashad, oh God,
he knew Juan raped me.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.883
The entire team knew, even Coach Corey.

55:00.250 --> 55:02.512
Rashad just didn't wanna feel guilty.

55:02.512 --> 55:03.345
You know.

55:04.990 --> 55:07.505
Getting raped changes a person, Michelle.

55:07.505 --> 55:08.422
- It can.

55:08.422 --> 55:09.290
- Rashad had it coming.

55:09.290 --> 55:10.220
- He did.

55:10.220 --> 55:14.030
- Claudia, I just didn't like that bitch.

55:14.030 --> 55:14.863
- I liked her.

55:14.863 --> 55:16.070
- What about John?

55:16.070 --> 55:18.407
You took John from me, why?

55:18.407 --> 55:19.960
- Oh please, Michelle.

55:19.960 --> 55:22.250
Your daddy's been sucking
his dick for years,

55:22.250 --> 55:25.709
were you really gonna take him back?

55:25.709 --> 55:26.822
- I wouldn't.

55:26.822 --> 55:29.160
- I feel like, like I did you a favor.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.265
- She really did, she really did.

55:31.265 --> 55:32.786
And me and Chiggy, by the way,

55:32.786 --> 55:34.020
we've been fucking since freshman year.

55:34.020 --> 55:35.960
- Oh yeah, babe, I'm the man.

55:35.960 --> 55:39.530
- What can I say, the dick
is just, it's amazing.

55:39.530 --> 55:40.560
- You hear that?

55:40.560 --> 55:42.577
I know you're dead, but
it's better than your dick.

55:42.577 --> 55:45.858
- But every chess player has a pawn.

55:52.146 --> 55:53.563
- Bitch.

55:54.749 --> 55:56.770
- Gotta give it to him, though.

55:56.770 --> 55:58.840
The way he put that game together.

55:58.840 --> 55:59.903
It was brilliant.

56:00.840 --> 56:02.733
Shit, even scared me.

56:04.805 --> 56:05.955
And then there was you.

56:07.662 --> 56:09.453
- I'm your best friend.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.100
I never betrayed you.

56:11.100 --> 56:12.520
- No.

56:12.520 --> 56:17.143
But you were a constant reminder
of what I would never be.

56:18.420 --> 56:21.540
You had John, you had your college career,

56:21.540 --> 56:24.620
you had your rich dad and that big house.

56:24.620 --> 56:25.840
- That wasn't my fault.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.450
You know, my dad didn't want you around,

56:27.450 --> 56:29.840
so I couldn't do anything.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.500
- You left me.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.300
Did you call me once?

56:33.300 --> 56:35.590
Did you ever come to visit me? No.

56:35.590 --> 56:37.400
It's like you just started this new life,

56:37.400 --> 56:39.563
and all of a sudden, Egypt doesn't matter.

56:41.134 --> 56:43.353
But, you had time to contact Alex.

56:44.611 --> 56:45.990
- It wasn't like that.

56:45.990 --> 56:47.243
- And that's what I thought.

56:47.243 --> 56:51.333
Imagine my surprise when I
found out that Alex had a son.

56:53.480 --> 56:55.820
Anthony Alexander.

56:55.820 --> 56:56.850
What is he, 14 now?

56:56.850 --> 56:58.000
- No, Egypt.

56:59.349 --> 57:03.380
- Chiggy, God rest his
soul, he's been a busybody

57:03.380 --> 57:04.270
these past few years.

57:04.270 --> 57:05.900
I mean, tracking you guys down.

57:05.900 --> 57:09.250
That couldn't have been an easy task.

57:09.250 --> 57:12.313
And when he told me about
Alex Jr., I thought, no.

57:13.647 --> 57:15.458
But then I started to think.

57:15.458 --> 57:17.533
I did just a few minor calculations.

57:18.800 --> 57:21.423
That would have put us
in what, ninth grade?

57:24.280 --> 57:26.680
Wait, and then I remembered that,

57:26.680 --> 57:30.120
you had the flu and you left that summer.

57:30.120 --> 57:32.366
- It's not what you think.

57:32.366 --> 57:36.137
- Bitch, you have no idea what I think.

57:36.137 --> 57:38.617
But what I know is that
you went behind my back

57:39.810 --> 57:42.353
and slept with my Alex and got pregnant.

57:43.912 --> 57:45.960
And for that reason alone,

57:45.960 --> 57:50.723
I'm gonna enjoy kicking your
ass right before I kill you.

57:52.817 --> 57:54.403
Michelle, come on, really?

57:55.903 --> 57:57.153
Just like in high school.

57:58.310 --> 57:59.253
Where's your dad?

57:59.253 --> 58:00.840
He's not here, is he?

58:00.840 --> 58:01.793
Little Michelle.

58:17.293 --> 58:19.663
- I don't know
what Lucas ever saw in you.

58:21.580 --> 58:22.413
- Hey.

58:23.554 --> 58:27.449
Everything's gonna be
perfect, you know that, right?

58:27.449 --> 58:28.440
- Yeah.

58:28.440 --> 58:31.353
- We have each other now, and
that's all we'll ever need.

58:37.950 --> 58:39.963
- Lucas hung himself eight years ago.

58:41.350 --> 58:43.593
Said he just couldn't live without her.

58:45.370 --> 58:48.090
But he told me that you
were a good friend to him.

58:48.090 --> 58:49.190
So thank you for that.

58:52.940 --> 58:55.660
- Luke, I've known you since we were kids.

58:55.660 --> 58:58.340
And you are one of the sweetest

58:58.340 --> 59:00.780
and kindest guys I have ever known.

59:00.780 --> 59:03.380
Not every girl deserves to
be with someone like you.

59:04.460 --> 59:07.003
Especially someone who
doesn't deserve it anyway.

59:10.940 --> 59:13.377
- Now I can be home with my Luke.

59:17.359 --> 59:18.289
- No!

59:28.900 --> 59:31.923
- Hello, Officer Morris, can
you tell me what happened?

59:33.130 --> 59:33.963
Ma'am?

59:34.930 --> 59:36.853
Ma'am, can you hear me?

59:38.441 --> 59:39.800
- It all started with the game

59:39.800 --> 59:40.850
Truth or Double Dare.
