WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.971
Donna, I'm so glad
you're my study partner.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.611
Because you make learning fun.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.349
Okay. Well, no more study breaks.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.512
We have to get this report done.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.250
All right. Fine.
Okay.

00:24.324 --> 00:28.283
A report on the current state
of U.S.-Soviet relations.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.454
Okay, we need a title.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.661
How 'bout "Current State
of U.S.-Soviet Relations"?

00:34.734 --> 00:36.964
Damn, you're smart.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.732
U.S.-Soviet Relations.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.246
You know, Donna,
I lost my underwear.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.618
But...

00:59.692 --> 01:02.422
whatever.

01:02.495 --> 01:05.726
Okay. Seriously,
we need to get some work done.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.734
Donna,
I couldn't agree with you more.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.736
Okay.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.068
Right now,
with a push of a button...

01:13.139 --> 01:17.473
the two superpowers could
condemn us to painful, fiery deaths.

01:17.544 --> 01:20.035
Fiery... deaths.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.422
Okay.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.385
Seriously, we gotta do this thing.

01:36.463 --> 01:39.398
You're right.
Eric, no more study breaks.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.833
Uh, right.
From now on, all business.

01:46.873 --> 01:51.503
The arms race began with the massive
buildup of bombers by the Soviet Union.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.240
Actually, the United States
started the arms buildup.

01:54.314 --> 01:57.477
No, they didn't.
What about the bomber gap?

01:57.550 --> 02:00.849
Bomber gap?
What?

02:02.555 --> 02:04.716
That's so cute.

02:05.925 --> 02:09.588
<i>Bombers by the United...</i>

02:09.662 --> 02:11.596
States.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.424
What are you doing?

02:17.170 --> 02:19.502
Study break?

02:19.572 --> 02:21.904
Get bent.

02:23.042 --> 02:25.374
<i>Ow! Oh, there's my underwear.</i>

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.616 --> 03:07.780
- Hey, Donna. What's wrong?
- Eric, you can't just ignore my ideas.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.152
Oh.

03:10.223 --> 03:14.182
Donna.
You'll get the same "A" I get.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.786
Relax, baby.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.595
Eric, I can't relax
'cause you're wrong, and I'm right.

03:22.802 --> 03:26.135
Okay. Okay.

03:26.206 --> 03:30.643
I think we need to clear our heads
with a nice study break.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.079
Eric, knock it off. I'm not in the mood
for a stupid study break.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.948
<i>What? Why?</i>
<i>Because I disagree with you?</i>

03:39.018 --> 03:41.919
- It has nothing to do with that.
- Really, Donna?

03:41.988 --> 03:44.650
Because up until now,
we were going at it like rabbits...

03:44.724 --> 03:48.285
who had just gotten out of prison.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.852
Well, that's over.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.489
Wait. So what are you saying?

03:54.567 --> 03:58.094
You're gonna hold out on me until I agree with
you? Because that's not gonna work, Donna.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.662
First of all,
I'm not holding out on you.

04:00.740 --> 04:05.541
And second of all,
if I did, it would <i>so</i> work.

04:08.548 --> 04:12.006
Okay, well, you know what?
I think that <i>is</i> what you're doing.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.543
So try this dress on for size!
I'm cutting you off!

04:15.622 --> 04:18.182
Yeah!

04:21.160 --> 04:25.324
- Is that supposed to be a threat?
- Supposed to be.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.798
Yeah.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.597
Okay.
If you wanna do this, we'll do this.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.662
But you're gonna cave,
and I'm gonna laugh. Yeah!

04:40.013 --> 04:42.743
I just saw a U.F.O.!

04:44.584 --> 04:47.576
Oh, my God!
What an unbelievable coincidence.

04:47.654 --> 04:51.613
I was just telling Fez
about how dumb you are!

04:57.597 --> 05:00.828
Okay. No. So I'm out in the field, right?
And there it was.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.698
It was in the air,
and it had lights, and it was, like...

05:11.411 --> 05:14.812
That's a U.F.O., all right.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.815
Hang on, Fez. Kelso.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.977
Remember that time you thought
you saw the Abominable Snowman?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.645
Yeah.

05:21.721 --> 05:25.987
- Do you remember what it turned out to be?
- Just a regular snowman.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.955
Guys, come on. Let's go out to the field.
It could come back.

05:34.033 --> 05:38.527
You think I got nothing better to do
than stand in a field freezing my 'nads off?

05:38.604 --> 05:42.199
Hey, who wants to help me
connect the dots?

05:42.275 --> 05:44.209
Sorry, 'nads. Let's go.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.652
What is all that noise?

05:59.726 --> 06:03.355
Oh, Bob's cutting down a tree
in his front yard.

06:03.429 --> 06:05.420
By himself?

06:06.833 --> 06:10.860
Doesn't he know
that's incredibly dangerous?

06:12.105 --> 06:16.269
Yeah, but you know what
they say about Bob...

06:16.342 --> 06:18.833
"He's stupid."

06:18.911 --> 06:20.902
Oh, Red.

06:20.980 --> 06:24.814
Is that any way to talk about a friend?

06:24.884 --> 06:27.375
A stupid friend.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.945
<i>Timber!</i>

06:31.023 --> 06:34.288
<i>Oh, no!</i>

06:56.416 --> 06:58.850
Oh, damn it!

06:58.918 --> 07:00.943
Did Bob kill me?

07:01.020 --> 07:05.184
Oh, but he just feels super bad about it.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.226
Mm-hmm.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.591
So, where is everyone?

07:09.662 --> 07:13.154
Boy, you can hardly tell
where your head was crushed.

07:15.501 --> 07:17.935
Where are all my friends?

07:19.972 --> 07:22.600
You don't really have any friends, Red.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.743
You know,
it's-it's an unfortunate side effect...

07:26.813 --> 07:31.409
of telling everybody
to-to stick it up their butts.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.212
Yeah.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.280
Gee, I guess you're right, Kitty.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.985
Maybe I should have been nicer.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.392
Yeah.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.364
Oh, well.
Hindsight's twenty-twenty.

07:46.432 --> 07:49.424
You just lie back
and enjoy your coffin.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.970
Ooh, satin. That's nice.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.909
Red! Red! Oh, I'm so sorry!
It was an accident.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.545
Bob...

08:08.621 --> 08:11.613
I never thought I'd say this...

08:11.691 --> 08:14.626
but I'm glad you're my friend.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.464
Red, I never thought I'd say this...

08:21.534 --> 08:24.128
but... you smell nice.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.876
- Jackie, that's really annoying.
- Knock it off, Hyde!

08:40.953 --> 08:43.443
Donna, is there something
you need to talk about?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.515
Oh, crap. Do you need
to talk about something?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.094
Can you keep a secret?

08:50.162 --> 08:52.153
- Not really.
- Yeah.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.722
Unless I can burn you with it later.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.968
I'm holding out on Eric.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.436
I'm holding out on Donna.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.439
Donna, that's great!

09:01.507 --> 09:03.634
Forman, that's hysterical.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.870
So, how long has it been?

09:05.945 --> 09:09.813
Three of the longest days of my life.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.850
Maybe I should just cave.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.852
No!

09:13.920 --> 09:15.854
If you cave, she owns you.

09:15.922 --> 09:19.414
When he caves, you own him.

09:19.492 --> 09:23.121
Yeah, but there's no way
she wants it as bad as I do.

09:23.195 --> 09:27.131
Can you blame her?

09:27.199 --> 09:30.225
I think I want it more than Eric.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.294
Eww. Why?

09:34.040 --> 09:37.874
Forman,
sex is how women control men.

09:37.944 --> 09:42.278
Donna, sex is how we control men.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.942
If they ever find out we want it too...

09:45.017 --> 09:47.508
we'll never get jewelry again.

09:49.956 --> 09:52.618
Secretly, I believe
they like it as much as we do.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.355
Oh. You and your
crazy conspiracies.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.339
Hyde, what are you doing?

10:07.406 --> 10:09.397
This means something.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.473
This is important.

10:13.546 --> 10:18.176
Well, this is a close encounter
of the potato kind.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.110
I'm sorry.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.679
How's it going, guys?

10:24.757 --> 10:27.157
Good to see you all.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.519
Kitty, I've been thinking.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.589
It might be fun to have our friends
over for a party.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.103
Oh, whoo-hoo! Party at Red's!

10:38.170 --> 10:40.934
Are you feeling okay, Red?

10:41.007 --> 10:43.976
Oh, honey, honey, don't touch him.

10:45.044 --> 10:48.275
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay. Well, I just...

10:48.347 --> 10:51.714
I have never heard you use the words
"fun," "friends" and "party"...

10:51.784 --> 10:53.752
all in the same sentence.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.379
I have, Mrs. Forman.

10:56.455 --> 11:01.290
For instance, "Eric, I had fun ruining
the party for you and your friends."

11:03.829 --> 11:06.821
Yeah, that was fun.

11:06.899 --> 11:09.629
Well, I think a party
is a great idea, Red.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.194
Great. Then it's settled.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.263
How you doin' there, Sabu?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.280
He smells nice.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.186
- Hello, Donna.
- Hello, Eric. I have come to work on our report.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.321
- Excellent. May I take your coat for you?
- Of course.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.938
Holy crap! She is so sexy.

11:48.007 --> 11:52.068
Be strong. Fight back. Use the look.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.182
Oh, no. Not the look.

11:59.251 --> 12:03.085
It's so... Wait. I find this hot?

12:03.155 --> 12:05.089
What is wrong with me?

12:05.157 --> 12:07.990
Come on, Pinciotti. Counterattack.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.262
Oops.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.930
Look away! Oh, I can't look away.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.941
Must touch.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.000
No! Be strong.

12:28.681 --> 12:33.812
Well, Donna, if you would refer to page 83...

12:37.323 --> 12:39.553
Oh, the ear!

12:39.625 --> 12:42.287
Damn him!

12:42.361 --> 12:45.626
Wait.
Must win this for womankind.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.565
Must crush Eric.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.367
Red alert.
She is touching your thigh!

12:57.042 --> 13:00.409
Oh, no. Plan backfiring.

13:00.479 --> 13:03.312
Thigh is so warm, inviting.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.680
Bony, but nice.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.946
<i>Donna, your mother's on the phone.</i>

13:12.024 --> 13:14.015
Oh, thank God!

13:15.628 --> 13:19.621
- Eric, everything all right?
- Fine. Shut the door, please.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.155
Hey, dudes.

13:46.591 --> 13:49.082
Leo, what are you doing here, man?

13:49.160 --> 13:52.425
Wow.
That's a really good question, man.

13:57.702 --> 14:00.296
- Leo?
- I'm working on it, man.

14:02.307 --> 14:06.141
- Chocodile?
- What's that?

14:06.211 --> 14:09.305
It's a Twinkie
wrapped in chocolate, man.

14:09.381 --> 14:13.044
No, in the sky! Those lights.
I think that's a U.F.O.

14:14.619 --> 14:17.952
It's just a plane.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.651
They're all just planes.

14:20.725 --> 14:23.853
Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.

14:25.497 --> 14:28.625
Now I've got photographic evidence.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.397
Of what? That planes can fly?

14:32.470 --> 14:34.938
I saw a U.F.O. Once, man.

14:35.006 --> 14:39.170
It was awesome.
It just hung in the air.

14:39.244 --> 14:41.838
Then it sent me a message...

14:41.913 --> 14:44.404
in big, bright yellow letters.

14:44.482 --> 14:47.417
It told me I was gonna
have a good year.

14:49.854 --> 14:53.255
Did this, by any chance,
happen at a football game?

14:54.426 --> 14:56.360
Yeah, man.

14:58.363 --> 15:02.697
And the weird thing was,
I was the only one freaking out about it.

15:05.670 --> 15:09.333
Wait a second. Good year?

15:09.407 --> 15:12.399
Ah, it was a terrible year, man.

15:12.477 --> 15:15.037
Stupid aliens.

15:15.113 --> 15:17.308
Hey, Red!

15:17.382 --> 15:19.907
I was just telling Tony here
how I almost killed you with a tree.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.976
- Ooh.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo.

15:22.053 --> 15:26.012
- Close call like that can really make you think, huh?
- You bet.

15:26.091 --> 15:31.085
You know, it's like I was upset that you
hadn't returned my hedge clippers.

15:31.162 --> 15:34.757
Oh, shoot. I think I gave those
to my brother-in-law.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.825
You did, did you?

15:37.902 --> 15:41.633
Oh, well, that's okay.
It's not like you stole them or anything.

15:41.706 --> 15:44.641
You just took 'em
and never returned 'em...

15:44.709 --> 15:46.700
which is different somehow.

15:46.778 --> 15:49.576
Ha!

15:49.648 --> 15:52.208
It's...

15:53.785 --> 15:55.776
Mom, can I ask you a question?

15:55.854 --> 15:58.618
In your relationship with Dad,
have you ever...

15:58.690 --> 16:01.989
let an argument cross
into other parts of your relationship?

16:02.060 --> 16:04.426
What do you mean?

16:04.496 --> 16:07.954
You know, I mean, do you ever...

16:08.033 --> 16:10.433
not have sex with Dad?

16:10.502 --> 16:14.768
Sure! I'm not having sex
with him right now.

16:16.841 --> 16:19.742
No, Mom, I mean, like,
in an argument, to get your way.

16:19.811 --> 16:22.575
You can do that?

16:22.647 --> 16:25.741
Yeah. I just wonder if it's wrong.

16:25.817 --> 16:28.047
Donna, you're saying...

16:28.119 --> 16:30.815
by my not having sex
with your father...

16:30.889 --> 16:33.790
I can get him
to paint the bathroom?

16:33.858 --> 16:37.988
Yeah. But don't you think
it hurts the relationship?

16:38.063 --> 16:41.464
Blah, blah, blah!
I'm getting my bathroom painted!

16:48.673 --> 16:52.040
And two of them to turn the ladder.

16:52.110 --> 16:56.046
Yeah.

16:56.114 --> 16:59.641
Yeah, those Polish people... they sure
don't know much about lightbulbs.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.982
Exactly.

17:02.053 --> 17:05.045
Two of them turn the ladder.

17:10.295 --> 17:14.595
So Sammy Davis Jr., the pope
and this Polish guy are on a plane, see?

17:14.665 --> 17:17.760
There's only the one parachute.

17:19.436 --> 17:23.771
Hey, Red, seeing as how you're
dead and all, can I have those shoes?

17:24.909 --> 17:27.570
Get away from him!

17:27.645 --> 17:31.046
Red, honey, your funeral's a big hit.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.676
You are corpse of the year.

17:33.752 --> 17:37.688
Just put the lid on, Kitty.
I need some freakin' quiet.

17:45.563 --> 17:49.522
- Are you having fun?
- No.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.592
Turns out I was mistaken.

17:51.669 --> 17:54.695
Life is too short to spend it
with people who annoy you.

17:54.773 --> 17:59.142
I... I just wanna spend it
with people I really, really love.

17:59.210 --> 18:02.043
Like you and, uh...

18:02.113 --> 18:05.344
Well, mostly just you.

18:05.416 --> 18:08.214
Everybody.

18:08.286 --> 18:11.153
Thanks for being here.

18:11.222 --> 18:13.520
And I just wanna say...

18:13.591 --> 18:18.221
when my time comes,
I wanna be buried facedown...

18:18.296 --> 18:22.824
so that anyone who doesn't
like me can kiss my ass.

18:44.389 --> 18:46.880
Hey, Kelso, man.
I brought you your film.

18:46.958 --> 18:49.290
U.F.O. Pictures came out okay.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.828
Aha! Proof.

18:51.896 --> 18:54.729
But these naked ones of you
are far more interesting, man.

18:57.735 --> 18:59.703
What?
Those were on that roll?

18:59.771 --> 19:02.205
You know, I don't see a U.F.O....

19:02.273 --> 19:05.265
but I can definitely see Uranus.

19:13.518 --> 19:16.009
It's a planet,
but it's also your butt.

19:16.087 --> 19:18.487
You guys are so immature.

19:18.556 --> 19:22.083
- Kelso, why are you squirting water out of your mouth?
- I was a fountain!

19:22.160 --> 19:25.129
I totally got it, man. It's art.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.358
Man.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.530
Hey, you guys wanna see
the other set he brought?

19:34.606 --> 19:36.938
Ohh!

19:46.284 --> 19:50.983
Donna, we've gotta get this thing done.
This report is due in six hours.

19:51.055 --> 19:54.286
Yeah, Eric.
I've been thinking about it.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.351
This whole Cold War standoff?
It's ridiculous.

19:57.428 --> 20:00.727
Neither side is getting what it wants.

20:00.798 --> 20:04.461
So, what you're saying is...

20:04.535 --> 20:08.699
by hurting each other,
they're actually hurting themselves.

20:08.773 --> 20:14.006
Yeah. It must be incredibly frustrating
for both sides.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.176
Both of them are just building up
and building up.

20:18.249 --> 20:23.050
The urge to launch a first strike
must be overwhelming...

20:23.121 --> 20:25.954
and painful.

20:26.024 --> 20:29.152
You know, Donna, in a lot of ways,
what we're going through here...

20:29.227 --> 20:31.718
is just like the Cuban missile crisis...

20:31.796 --> 20:34.492
except in our case, it's a...

20:34.565 --> 20:37.159
missile crisis.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.462
Eric, you're right.
It's time for détente.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.800
Wait.
What about our disagreement?

20:46.878 --> 20:49.369
I don't care. You win, okay?

20:51.549 --> 20:53.483
What?

20:53.551 --> 20:57.317
It's just... I can't believe you caved.
Wait until I tell Hyde.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.923
No. No!
Where are you going?

21:02.994 --> 21:05.258
Suddenly I'm...
I'm not in the mood.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.356
You're lying!

21:08.433 --> 21:11.630
Donna, we're past the point
of no return here.

21:11.703 --> 21:15.298
Eric, girls don't have
a point of no return.

21:15.373 --> 21:17.671
So see you tomorrow.

21:19.744 --> 21:22.872
- Donna?
- Yes, Eric?

21:24.949 --> 21:28.441
- I cave.
- Oh, thank God, 'cause I was just bluffing.
