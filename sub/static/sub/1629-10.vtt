just as much as you.

about prophecies

08:44.900 --> 08:47.107

to pursue the lady Swan.

a few with the dwarfs.

when it comes to Emma.

standing in the way.

So what exactly am I waiting for?

14:04.094 --> 14:05.834
-How did you know?
-You had that look on your face.

14:05.929 --> 14:06.918
What look?

14:07.014 --> 14:08.800
The look you have
when you're up to something.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.885
I'm guessing this little excursion

14:11.977 --> 14:13.933
has something to do
with Regina's threat.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.638
When I was a little girl,

14:18.775 --> 14:21.266
the palace servants used to tell stories
of a fearsome creature

14:21.361 --> 14:23.352
that lived in a nearby cave.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.527
What kind of creature?

14:24.614 --> 14:29.859
The kind that if you were to look into
her eyes, she would turn you into stone.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.323
They called her Medusa.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.412
And what, you thought
we could turn Regina to stone?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.080
How? By capturing this Medusa?

14:36.168 --> 14:38.329
No, no, no. No.
By cutting off her head.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.293
And what? Sending it to her in a box?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.837
I hadn't gotten that far yet.
But if I have the head,

14:42.966 --> 14:45.924
ljust need to make Regina look at her
for a moment to turn her into stone.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.501
And I can figure out that part
after I have the head.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.720
Absolutely not. I'm not letting
my wife venture into the woods

14:50.807 --> 14:52.388
to chase a monster.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.518
At least, not alone.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.725
-You mean...
-Yes.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.271
I'm coming with you.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.269
You're obviously not going to relax
until we find a weapon

15:02.360 --> 15:03.395
to use against Regina.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.352
But, Snow,
you have to promise one thing.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.986
If we find this Medusa and figure out
how to use her against Regina,

15:10.077 --> 15:13.661
you have to at least try to enjoy
what's left of our honeymoon.

can turn her victims into stone,

is to kill Medusa.

any different?

39:14.770 --> 39:16.010
No, it's not.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.720
Even if Pan's down there, I can't use
my gun, he's in Henry's body.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.521
And we'll get him out. We'll save him.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.520
-Will we?
-Yes.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.522
And because of you.
You were right about Pan.

39:24.613 --> 39:27.195
Just like your mother was about Regina
all those years ago.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.783
We'll stop him. And then you can...

39:28.867 --> 39:31.358
Live my moments? Even though
there's still terrible things out there?

39:31.453 --> 39:32.613
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.116
You're great parents, but you're wrong.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.206
I'm the Savior.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.874
I don't have the luxury
of having moments.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.122
It's just not my life.

39:41.838 --> 39:45.456
Every time I think I'm gonna sit back
and enjoy myself, I can't.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.966
Because it's never gonna stop.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.635
| used to think the same way.

39:51.807 --> 39:54.298
It's different. My magic has a price.

39:55.143 --> 39:58.135
The price of being the Savior is,

40:00.357 --> 40:01.893
I don't get a day off.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.232
-(WHOOSH)
-(DOORS CREAK)

40:08.323 --> 40:09.312
Shall we?

40:15.330 --> 40:16.319
Regina!

40:18.709 --> 40:20.199
Pan's gone.

40:20.669 --> 40:21.704
We're clear down here!

40:29.052 --> 40:30.758
(WHOOSH)

40:30.846 --> 40:32.837
REGINA: Mmm.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.173
(INHALES SHARPLY)
What?

40:37.769 --> 40:38.804
What happened?

40:38.895 --> 40:41.352
lt's Henry. Somehow,
Pan switched bodies with him.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.181
And I fell for it.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.356
We all did.

40:45.444 --> 40:48.777
I wanted to believe what he was saying
so badly, I missed all the signs.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.405
| just wanted to believe that he still
needed me to be his mother.

40:52.534 --> 40:53.865
I still do.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.361
(GASPS) Henry?

41:05.881 --> 41:09.373
So what exactly did Pan
come down here to get?

41:09.468 --> 41:11.550
-(WHOOSH)
-What?

41:13.305 --> 41:15.136
Please tell me
you didn't keep it down here.

41:16.475 --> 41:17.965
Where else would I keep it?

41:20.228 --> 41:21.889
What is it? What did Pan take?

41:22.731 --> 41:23.766
A curse?

41:23.899 --> 41:26.140
No, Felix. The curse.

41:27.069 --> 41:29.651
The curse that tore everyone
from the Enchanted Forest

41:29.738 --> 41:31.399
and dropped them here.

41:31.490 --> 41:35.950
You broke me out ofjail to tell me
how everyone got to this town?

41:36.078 --> 41:37.318
I broke you out ofjail

41:37.996 --> 41:41.409
because this spell is going to give us
everything we've always wanted.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.084
Why would Pan even want the curse?
I already cast it.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.205
And I broke it.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.082
Well, that doesn't mean
he can't cast it again.

41:48.423 --> 41:51.210
And this time, without your parents'
true love woven in,

41:51.301 --> 41:52.882
even you would be powerless
to break it.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.005
I don't understand.
We're already in this land.

41:55.097 --> 41:58.681
What exactly would casting the curse
in Storybrooke do now?

41:58.767 --> 42:00.632
Everyone will forget who they are.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.805
Time will stand still.

42:03.605 --> 42:06.563
And, Felix, we will be in charge.

42:07.818 --> 42:09.479
Of this whole place.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.774
Yes. And when we're done with it,

42:13.115 --> 42:14.855
it's going to be the new Neverland.
