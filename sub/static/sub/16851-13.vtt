00:01.435 --> 00:03.471
(male narrator)
 Previously,
 on Children's Hospital.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.372
The test came back.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.174
It's endometrial cancer.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.576
You have two
or three weeks, tops.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.244
How about now?

00:12.313 --> 00:13.481
Alright, six weeks.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.449
The tests don't lie.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.386
Unless, it's a lie-detector
test that's malfunctioning.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.355
Then that would be a textbook
example of a test lying.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.791
But it's not,
and your son is terminal.

00:23.824 --> 00:28.496
Mmm! I finally get a chance
to sit down and eat my sandwich.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.199
[theme music]

00:32.533 --> 00:34.302
Mm, that was good.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.170
(Sal on PA)
'Attention hospital staff.'

00:36.204 --> 00:38.639
'My wife is so fat!'

00:38.672 --> 00:41.509
'Please direct any follow-up
questions to Human Resources.'

00:41.542 --> 00:43.744
What happened while I wasn't
drinking in the bathroom?

00:43.777 --> 00:45.779
About two dozen kids
got some bad salmon

00:45.813 --> 00:47.815
at the Spiegelman bar mitzvah.
 Throwing up everywhere.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.485
It's been a real bummer for me.
Blake, can you give me a hand?

00:51.519 --> 00:54.855
Pass. Know how some people puke
at the sight of blood?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.091
- I'm like that, but with puke.
- Isn't everyone?

00:57.125 --> 00:59.227
I mean, bile triggers
a natural gag reflex.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.562
Yeah, I guess you're right,
Valerie. I'm not special.

01:01.595 --> 01:06.300
Besides, it's my day off.
Just came by to get my buds.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.802
Well, there's only
one man who can handle

01:08.836 --> 01:10.804
a situation this Jewish.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.442
(Glenn)
 Being a Jew is fantastic.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.677
We have big hands,
 we kick ass at math

01:16.710 --> 01:19.247
and we can lift three times
 our body weight.

01:19.280 --> 01:22.250
Every Jewish boy dreams of
 becoming an older Jewish man.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.419
But it isn't always as easy
 as you might think.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.855
Nice game, gentlemen.
Nice game.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.858
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, babe.

01:30.891 --> 01:34.162
The E.R.'s full of Jewish kids
with both-ends diarrhea.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.497
Should be a coffee-cakewalk
for you, though

01:36.530 --> 01:39.833
'Cause you're the only doctor
here who's had a bar mitzvah.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.470
- You got the wrong guy.
- But Glenn, we need you.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.804
I can't do it.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.806
Black guys,
best two out of three.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.609
Glen, as my boyfirend,
you owe me an explanation.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.844
I've never been bar-mitzvahed,
you get it?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.380
Do you get it now?

01:52.413 --> 01:54.182
So what?
I mean, who cares?

01:54.215 --> 01:56.650
A bar mitzvah is the
passage to manhood.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.187
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.389
I was a thirteen-year old boy..

02:01.422 --> 02:03.457
...a few weeks away
from the big day..

02:03.491 --> 02:05.559
And then my parents
got divorced

02:05.593 --> 02:07.595
canceled my bar mitzvah
and that was it.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.663
So according
to Hebrew law, I'm..

02:09.697 --> 02:12.700
...I'm still twelve years old.
But don't tell my pubes that.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.934
I won't, Glenn.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.336
- I won't.
- Okay.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.338
You know what?
It's never too late.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.708
I'm gonna throw you the biggest,
the bestest bar mitzvah ever.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.443
You would do that for me?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.245
(Sal on PA)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

02:24.278 --> 02:25.946
'Yeah, I write these
when I'm high.'

02:25.979 --> 02:28.549
Guys, we have an
announcement to make.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.185
I'm throwing Glenn an adult
 bar mitzvah tomorrow morning.

02:31.219 --> 02:34.288
- And you're all invited!
- Oh! I call cantor!

02:34.322 --> 02:36.424
I called it first
because I am the

02:36.457 --> 02:38.626
Michael Jackson's
father of cantoring.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.827
Let's go.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.462
* Bora hou
Bora hou *

02:41.495 --> 02:43.431
* Bora hou-hou-hou

02:43.464 --> 02:46.534
What's all the excitement about?
 Bar mitzvah or no-mitzvah

02:46.567 --> 02:49.370
I ain't letting nobody
cut off my foreskin.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.772
No, Owen, you're
thinking of a bris.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.875
If a grown man was going to be
circumcised, you'd better

02:54.908 --> 02:58.312
believe that I would be bending
over backwards, forwards

02:58.346 --> 03:00.548
a little bit to the side,
to stop him.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.516
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Right?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.752
Why stop him? What's wrong
with it? I'm circumcised.

03:04.785 --> 03:08.389
Most women prefer
an untouched foreskin.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.425
- It's just way more masculine.
- And more sexy.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.526
- Rawr!
- Ow-ow!

03:12.560 --> 03:14.328
[imitating animals]

03:18.766 --> 03:20.901
I'm sorry your bar mitzvah
after-party was ruined.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.338
Oh, it's nothing.
I'm used to vomit.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.240
I'm a complete hypochondriac

03:26.274 --> 03:28.876
but, you know,
with actual illnesses.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.811
Well, at least
you had a ceremony.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.314
Any advice for an
up-and-coming adult?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.882
Let's just say you should, uh

03:34.915 --> 03:37.485
cross-check
your caterer references.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.752
- Brilliant.
- Hey.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.354
Hey.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.623
Okay. So, I sent out
invitations.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.991
I rented a sound system.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.026
- I e-mailed all of your aunts.
- Oh, wonderful!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.861
- I still haven't got a temple.
- What?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.497
Apparently,
this food-poisoning thing

03:49.530 --> 03:51.532
has taken out more than
one bar mitzvah.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.301
Oh! Tell me about it.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.937
I didn't realize the ten plagues
included cured fish.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.040
Hey, you are one special goyim.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.010
Well, maybe when
you're officially a man

04:03.043 --> 04:08.516
we can put the "adult"
back into "adult bar mitzvah."

04:08.549 --> 04:11.419
Shalom, doctors.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.654
What's going down
in the world of young health?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.423
Jewy McJew-Jew!

04:15.456 --> 04:17.825
Glenn Richie,
my old Hebrew school pal.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.027
- What is he doing here?
- No, Glenn, please.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.062
He offered to help
'cause he felt bad

04:22.095 --> 04:24.698
about trying to steal me
away from you last year.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.668
She's right. For once, I'm not
here to steal your woman.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.938
I'm here to ask you to forgive
me by letting me help you.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.408
I want to put more effort into
giving you a proper bar mitzvah

04:34.442 --> 04:36.944
than I ever did into stealing
those girls from you.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.448
Valerie and I have to talk over
the particulars of the ceremony.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.815
I'll come with you.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.584
- Coming with me.
- Ah-ah.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.653
Because you're gonna
memorize your haftorah.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.388
It's not gonna memorize itself.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.824
Chief, I've been looking
all over for you.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.794
Look, I need you to
un-circumcise me, A.S.A. Penis.

04:53.827 --> 04:57.665
Owen, nobody hates a
hoodless horseman more than me

04:57.698 --> 05:01.001
but adding-back-foreskin surgery
is incredibly dangerous.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.371
However, if it's that
important to you--

05:03.404 --> 05:05.105
Alright.
Can we get started quickly?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.375
I wanna ready for Glenn's
 bar mitzvah tomorrow.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.910
I'm gonna need your original
foreskin that was cut off

05:09.943 --> 05:13.847
of you when you were a baby.
Sorry, but it's the only way.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.750
[singing in Jewish]

05:21.054 --> 05:23.090
* Now you

05:23.123 --> 05:24.692
* Ba-roukha--

05:24.725 --> 05:26.827
Sy, what's it like to be a man?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.629
Well, when you get older

05:28.662 --> 05:31.632
you-you realize that life is
not just about being cool.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.401
You throw away your dungarees.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.669
You look for a
lighter-weight slack.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.539
A nice twilled docker,
for instance.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.508
Glenn, trust in Hashem.

05:40.541 --> 05:45.012
If you don't pay attention,
you're gonna get the belt again.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.415
Back over here to the table.
Come on.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.749
McJew-Jew!

05:52.152 --> 05:54.855
Valerie, how could you
do this to me?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.958
And McJew-Jew,
I kind of trusted you.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.494
- Glenn?
- Huh?

06:00.528 --> 06:04.164
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

06:04.197 --> 06:07.535
But I...saw you both in the car.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.671
- What car?
- What?

06:10.704 --> 06:14.007
- And where are your pants?
- Huh? Oh.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.876
Oi, I've seen this before.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.611
[speaking Jewish]

06:17.645 --> 06:19.447
Pre-mitzvah nerves.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.182
Glenn, come.
We need to talk.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.017
Hey, guys.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.087
Forgot my ankle weights
when I came back to get my buds

06:27.120 --> 06:29.022
but I got them now.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.624
Hope you're having a great day.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.996
Hey, Dad.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.931
Oh! Owen, wow.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.800
To what do we owe this honor?

06:39.833 --> 06:42.035
Did you run out of
sick children to "cure"?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.538
What is your problem with me
saving lives?

06:44.572 --> 06:46.440
Well, I'm glad
you're having fun, son.

06:46.474 --> 06:51.111
But, you know, the rest of us,
we're mending pants and whatnot!

06:51.144 --> 06:52.780
What are you doing here, anyway?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.816
I want my foreskin back.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.185
What makes you think I got
your wiener trimmings?

06:58.218 --> 07:01.522
- Thought it was worth a shot.
- Well, it wasn't, was it?

07:01.555 --> 07:04.458
Why don't you just prance on
back to your hospital there?

07:04.492 --> 07:06.059
For the hundredth time

07:06.093 --> 07:08.896
just because I work with
children does not make me gay.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.464
I'm majorly into chicks.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.700
In fact, that's why I want
my foreskin back.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.802
Well, I don't have it!

07:14.835 --> 07:16.570
[speaking foreign language]

07:17.971 --> 07:20.774
Ching-chong with a ding-dong!

07:20.808 --> 07:22.776
[speaking foreign language]

07:22.810 --> 07:25.145
Argh!

07:25.178 --> 07:27.815
Hey, mom.
I see you're still Chinese.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.483
I'll see you on China Day.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.218
[speaking foreign language]

07:31.251 --> 07:33.521
I am so sorry, you two.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.857
I was just so nervous, and I let
my old fears come back.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.792
Glenn, like it or not

07:38.826 --> 07:41.161
you have my mind,
my soul, and my body.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.664
I realize that now.
Thank you.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.099
And I'm happy to
put our past behind us, Glenn.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.736
And preside over your
special day and most of all

07:48.769 --> 07:50.671
to truly be friends with you.

07:50.704 --> 07:54.708
When you're up there on that
 bimah, I want you to wear this.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.083
The J.C. Penny suit you wore
at your bar mitzvah?

08:03.116 --> 08:06.920
- I can't wear this.
- You can, Glenn, and you will.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.188
Mazel tov.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.791
What more can a boy ask for?

08:10.824 --> 08:13.561
Such a day for nachas.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.296
And you don't even
have to tie the tie.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.600
I have an idea.
Let's have the bar mitzvah here.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.870
After all, Childrens Hospital
is my real temple.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.540
Only, in this temple,
kids die every day.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.241
Every day.

08:28.275 --> 08:32.245
Give me that foreskin, and
let's get this thing started.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.182
Owen, this is a piece of baloney

08:35.215 --> 08:38.018
that you folded in half and
nibbled the middle out of.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.654
Stop talking and start sewing
that deli meat onto me.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.890
Okay. Sterilize the bologna.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.959
Hey, just stop!
Just please, stop!

08:45.993 --> 08:48.929
Hey, get that China-man
out of here! Security!

08:48.962 --> 08:51.198
That's no China-man.
That's my dad.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.766
Look, I'm..

08:52.800 --> 08:54.602
...I'm sorry,
I lied to you, Owen.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.136
You were never circumcised.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.772
- But I have not a foreskin.
- Oh, yes, you have.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.008
Know how a tailor
hems a pair of pants

09:01.041 --> 09:03.176
he cuffs it off
with a few stitches?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.012
- Yeah.
- That's what we did with you.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.847
Oh, my gosh.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.283
All you have to do is just
rip out some of the seams.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.919
Tell you what.
Can I, uh...

09:11.952 --> 09:13.754
- Can I take over there, doc?
- Sure.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.355
Alright. Ahem.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.791
Oh, he hasn't had any
anesthesia. Does that matter?

09:17.825 --> 09:20.193
Yeah, maybe we should hold off--
Oh, ho! Ohh!

09:20.227 --> 09:21.228
Alright, just one more.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.663
[screaming]

09:22.696 --> 09:25.132
There you go!
One more, big boy.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.001
- A-a-ah! Oh-ho!
- Alright.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.302
(Chief)
That wasn't so bad.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.771
Thanks, Dad.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.641
- I love you.
- I love you too, son.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.375
- Where's mom?
- Oh, mom? I don't know.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.847
She's around here somewhere
being all Chinese.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.650
- Come here.
- Oh, that's my boy.

09:42.683 --> 09:45.085
(Glenn)
'We all become a man
in our own way.'

09:45.118 --> 09:46.920
'It just took me
a little longer.'

09:46.954 --> 09:48.756
'But I wouldn't have
changed a thing.'

09:48.789 --> 09:51.124
Because if it had happened
any earlier

09:51.158 --> 09:54.227
I wouldn't be here surrounded
by so many people that I love.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.698
I want to thank each and every
one of you, for, without you

09:57.731 --> 10:00.668
'I wouldn't be the full-grown
adult that I am today.'

10:00.701 --> 10:04.204
'And to the girl I love, who put
this all together, Valerie..'

10:10.410 --> 10:12.646
[singing in Jewish]

10:18.919 --> 10:23.256
Hey, you would not believe
the insane day I've had today.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.994
Okay.
Your breath is terrible.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.230
Terrible.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.133
[singing in Jewish]

10:35.368 --> 10:37.838
[instrumental music]

10:43.043 --> 10:46.714
Yay...
another Jew mitzvah.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.349
You know what? I like nurses
...sitting on my dong.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.751
Stop it.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.953
- You're disgusting.
- What?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.822
Jews are so sweet.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.390
Just...keep an eye
on your wallet.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.897
Off the phone. Off the phone.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.365
- Off the phone.
- I don't understand.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.100
- Off the phone.
- Oh.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.873
Oh, man, these hebes can eat.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.408
I can't wait to see
the comment card.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.978

11:22.249 --> 11:24.117
(Sal on PA)
'Attention hospital staff.'

11:24.151 --> 11:27.120
'Coffee is now available
in the coffee-break room.'

11:27.154 --> 11:28.288
'I mean, duh.'
