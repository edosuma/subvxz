01:48.157 --> 01:50.576
Bloody kids.

02:37.038 --> 02:40.709
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

02:40.875 --> 02:45.255
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

02:45.422 --> 02:50.635
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

02:50.802 --> 02:53.263
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

02:53.471 --> 02:54.723
I only meant...

02:54.890 --> 02:57.851
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

02:58.018 --> 03:00.395
No! The boy is everything!

03:00.562 --> 03:04.107
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

03:04.274 --> 03:06.943
Exactly as I said.

03:07.402 --> 03:11.072
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

03:11.239 --> 03:14.284
First, gather our old comrades.

03:14.451 --> 03:16.703
Send them a sign.

03:28.423 --> 03:31.927
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

03:32.093 --> 03:35.764
...is standing just outside the door.

03:35.931 --> 03:41.269
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

03:41.436 --> 03:43.271
Avada Kedavra!

03:48.276 --> 03:49.778
Harry.

03:50.528 --> 03:52.197
Harry!

03:53.490 --> 03:55.283
Are you all right?

03:55.992 --> 03:58.119
Hermione. Bad dream.

03:58.286 --> 04:01.623
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

04:01.790 --> 04:03.041
Last night.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.460
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

04:05.627 --> 04:06.878
Bloody hell.

04:07.045 --> 04:08.545
Honestly, get dressed.

04:09.296 --> 04:11.048
And don't go back to sleep.

04:11.215 --> 04:14.552
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

04:21.225 --> 04:24.061
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.815
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

04:27.982 --> 04:29.483
Keep up!

04:32.069 --> 04:33.904
Arthur!

04:34.071 --> 04:36.073
It's about time, son.

04:36.240 --> 04:40.619
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

04:40.786 --> 04:46.458
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.169
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

04:49.336 --> 04:50.504
Yes, sir.

04:50.671 --> 04:52.339
This way.

04:54.049 --> 04:57.428
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

04:57.595 --> 05:00.347
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

05:00.514 --> 05:02.308
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

05:04.935 --> 05:07.605
Yes, it's just over there.

05:09.857 --> 05:11.692
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

05:11.859 --> 05:13.027
We don't want to be late.

05:13.193 --> 05:17.364
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

05:18.365 --> 05:20.701
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

05:20.868 --> 05:23.370
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

05:23.537 --> 05:24.872
Time to go!

05:25.039 --> 05:26.665
What's a Portkey?

05:26.832 --> 05:30.878
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

05:31.045 --> 05:32.129
...three!

05:43.181 --> 05:44.307
Let go, kids!

05:44.474 --> 05:47.060
- What?!
- Let go!

05:59.113 --> 06:01.699
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

06:02.742 --> 06:05.245
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

06:11.042 --> 06:13.169
Go on, look at that!

06:13.419 --> 06:17.924
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

06:20.927 --> 06:23.596
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

06:25.098 --> 06:26.391
Look!

06:27.267 --> 06:29.561
Come on! Keep up, girls!

06:36.442 --> 06:37.860
Blimey!

06:38.027 --> 06:39.904
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

06:40.071 --> 06:41.447
- See you at the match.
- See you.

06:41.614 --> 06:42.949
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

06:43.116 --> 06:44.784
See you later, Cedric.

06:49.414 --> 06:51.499
Home sweet home.

06:53.293 --> 06:54.836
What?

07:02.260 --> 07:04.137
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

07:04.304 --> 07:05.638
- All to the bath.
- Look.

07:05.805 --> 07:08.308
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

07:08.892 --> 07:11.311
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

07:11.477 --> 07:13.980
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

07:14.146 --> 07:16.440
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

07:17.649 --> 07:19.818
I love magic.

07:35.167 --> 07:38.545
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

07:38.837 --> 07:42.007
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

07:42.174 --> 07:43.592
Well, put it this way:

07:43.842 --> 07:45.552
If it rains...

07:45.719 --> 07:48.055
...you'll be the first to know.

07:48.847 --> 07:51.225
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

07:51.391 --> 07:54.686
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

07:54.853 --> 07:57.022
Don't boast, Draco.

07:57.189 --> 07:59.316
There's no need with these people.

08:01.777 --> 08:04.279
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

08:04.696 --> 08:06.531
While you can.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.591
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.635
Come on!

08:28.887 --> 08:30.847
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

08:31.014 --> 08:32.849
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

08:38.522 --> 08:41.400
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

08:45.654 --> 08:48.864
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

08:54.912 --> 08:56.289
Who's that?

08:57.081 --> 09:00.084
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

09:02.128 --> 09:05.673
Krum! Krum! Krum!

09:10.428 --> 09:11.637
Krum!

09:11.804 --> 09:13.556
Yes!

09:21.272 --> 09:23.190
Good evening!

09:23.733 --> 09:26.736
As Minister for Magic...

09:26.944 --> 09:29.989
...it gives me great pleasure...

09:30.615 --> 09:34.368
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

09:34.535 --> 09:40.416
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

09:41.042 --> 09:42.418
Let the match...

09:42.793 --> 09:44.378
...begin!

09:50.509 --> 09:52.678
Krum! Krum! Krum!

10:00.519 --> 10:02.188
There's no one like Krum.

10:02.355 --> 10:03.981
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

10:04.148 --> 10:07.193
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.279
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

10:10.446 --> 10:11.822
He's an artist.

10:11.989 --> 10:14.158
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

10:14.367 --> 10:15.826
Viktor, I love you

10:15.993 --> 10:17.620
Viktor, I do

10:17.787 --> 10:20.997
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

10:21.164 --> 10:23.833
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.752
Stop! Stop it!

10:26.294 --> 10:27.879
It's not the Irish.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.174
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

10:33.301 --> 10:35.679
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

10:35.845 --> 10:39.182
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

10:39.349 --> 10:42.018
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

10:42.561 --> 10:44.354
Go!

10:44.521 --> 10:46.356
Harry!

11:01.162 --> 11:03.331
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

11:04.583 --> 11:06.710
Harry! Harry!

11:54.381 --> 11:55.883
Morsmordre!

12:22.618 --> 12:24.119
Harry!

12:25.621 --> 12:28.832
- Where are you?
- Harry!

12:30.084 --> 12:32.711
We've been looking for you for ages!

12:33.796 --> 12:35.631
Thought we lost you, mate.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.467
What is that?

12:41.554 --> 12:43.639
Stupefy!

12:43.806 --> 12:45.140
Stop!

12:45.307 --> 12:47.518
That's my son!

12:48.561 --> 12:51.230
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

12:51.397 --> 12:52.690
Which of you conjured it?

12:52.856 --> 12:55.067
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

12:55.234 --> 12:57.194
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

12:57.361 --> 12:59.405
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

12:59.572 --> 13:01.073
What crime?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.742
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.077
What, Voldemort?

13:06.245 --> 13:10.124
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

13:10.291 --> 13:12.501
- His followers?
- Yeah.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.587
Death Eaters.

13:15.337 --> 13:19.341
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.176
There!

13:21.343 --> 13:23.679
All of you, this way!

13:24.388 --> 13:25.848
A man, Harry?

13:26.140 --> 13:27.599
Who?

13:28.016 --> 13:29.809
I don't know.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.646
I didn't see his face.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.999
Anything from the trolley?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.128
Anything from the trolley?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.800
Anything from the trolley, dears?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.178
Packet of Drooble's...

14:05.345 --> 14:07.138
...and a Licorice Wand.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.683
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.854
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.524
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.531
Thank you.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.368
Anything sweet for you, dear?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.538
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.457
Anything from the trolley?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.668
This is horrible.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.754
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.714
Wasn't there any security or...?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.676
Loads, according to Dad.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.805
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.852
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.688
I'm fine.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.608
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

15:01.775 --> 15:05.779
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.416
Hedwig. There we go.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.874
Clear the runway!

16:04.296 --> 16:07.049
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

16:31.031 --> 16:35.952
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

16:36.953 --> 16:40.373
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

16:40.540 --> 16:43.709
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

16:44.043 --> 16:46.629
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

16:47.630 --> 16:49.131
Yes, what is it?

16:49.340 --> 16:50.716
What is it?

16:53.052 --> 16:56.389
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

16:56.556 --> 17:02.520
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

17:02.687 --> 17:04.730
The Triwizard Tournament.

17:05.272 --> 17:07.358
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

17:07.525 --> 17:10.694
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

17:10.861 --> 17:12.989
...for a series of magical contests.

17:13.155 --> 17:16.617
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.578
Now let me be clear.

17:18.743 --> 17:21.664
If chosen, you stand alone.

17:21.830 --> 17:23.749
And trust me when I say...

17:23.915 --> 17:26.919
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

17:27.211 --> 17:31.549
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

17:31.716 --> 17:35.761
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

17:35.928 --> 17:39.891
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

17:52.445 --> 17:53.988
Bloody hell.

18:01.871 --> 18:04.207
Blimey. That's one big woman.

18:26.228 --> 18:28.313
And now our friends from the north.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.316
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

18:31.483 --> 18:34.277
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

18:57.342 --> 18:58.927
Oh, it's Krum!

18:59.094 --> 19:00.554
Blimey, it's him!

19:00.720 --> 19:02.597
Viktor Krum!

19:11.523 --> 19:12.941
Albus.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.818
Igor.

19:28.456 --> 19:32.127
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

19:32.294 --> 19:34.838
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

19:35.005 --> 19:38.550
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

19:38.717 --> 19:40.968
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

19:41.468 --> 19:43.762
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

19:50.060 --> 19:51.729
You idiot!

19:56.734 --> 19:58.736
Your attention, please!

20:01.113 --> 20:03.240
I'd like to say a few words.

20:04.992 --> 20:07.036
Eternal glory.

20:07.494 --> 20:11.540
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

20:11.707 --> 20:15.920
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

20:16.086 --> 20:19.965
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

20:20.466 --> 20:21.550
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

20:21.717 --> 20:25.888
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

20:26.055 --> 20:27.431
To explain all this...

20:27.598 --> 20:31.227
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

20:31.393 --> 20:33.520
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

20:47.952 --> 20:50.663
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

20:51.455 --> 20:54.667
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

20:54.833 --> 20:58.295
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

20:59.004 --> 21:02.132
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

21:13.893 --> 21:17.647
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

21:17.814 --> 21:18.940
Thank you.

21:25.446 --> 21:27.323
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

21:27.740 --> 21:30.743
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

21:37.709 --> 21:39.669
After due consideration...

21:39.836 --> 21:42.714
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

21:42.881 --> 21:45.842
...no student under the age of 17...

21:46.009 --> 21:49.762
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

21:49.929 --> 21:52.640
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

21:52.807 --> 21:55.393
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

21:55.560 --> 21:59.314
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

22:18.708 --> 22:21.127
The Goblet of Fire.

22:21.711 --> 22:24.589
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

22:24.756 --> 22:27.675
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

22:27.842 --> 22:30.929
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

22:32.055 --> 22:34.265
Do not do so lightly.

22:34.641 --> 22:38.228
If chosen, there's no turning back.

22:38.394 --> 22:43.358
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

23:09.508 --> 23:11.593
Alastor Moody.

23:13.512 --> 23:15.138
Ex-Auror...

23:16.848 --> 23:19.268
...Ministry malcontent...

23:19.476 --> 23:21.895
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

23:22.062 --> 23:26.525
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

23:26.692 --> 23:28.443
Any questions?

23:31.613 --> 23:33.365
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

23:34.741 --> 23:37.411
...I believe in a practical approach.

23:37.578 --> 23:43.292
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

23:43.792 --> 23:46.128
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

23:46.295 --> 23:49.548
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

23:49.715 --> 23:53.802
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

23:54.011 --> 23:56.763
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

23:56.930 --> 24:00.392
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

24:00.559 --> 24:02.728
You need to be prepared.

24:02.895 --> 24:05.355
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

24:05.522 --> 24:07.816
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

24:07.983 --> 24:10.986
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

24:11.695 --> 24:13.447
And hear across classrooms!

24:15.824 --> 24:19.327
So which curse shall we see first?

24:19.493 --> 24:20.703
- Weasley!
- Yes?

24:20.870 --> 24:22.205
Stand.

24:25.374 --> 24:27.168
Give us a curse.

24:27.335 --> 24:31.172
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

24:31.756 --> 24:33.007
The lmperius Curse.

24:33.174 --> 24:36.427
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

24:36.886 --> 24:39.555
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

24:40.014 --> 24:42.516
Perhaps this will show you why.

24:50.149 --> 24:51.484
Hello.

24:53.110 --> 24:54.820
Lovely little beauty.

24:57.949 --> 24:59.951
Engorgio.

25:00.326 --> 25:01.994
Imperio!

25:06.374 --> 25:08.834
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

25:15.007 --> 25:16.676
If she bites...

25:17.218 --> 25:18.719
...she's lethal.

25:21.222 --> 25:23.057
What are you laughing at?

25:24.392 --> 25:25.810
Get off!

25:28.229 --> 25:30.022
Talented, isn't she?

25:30.189 --> 25:33.568
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

25:35.570 --> 25:36.946
Drown herself?

25:48.749 --> 25:52.002
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

25:52.168 --> 25:56.172
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

25:56.339 --> 25:58.592
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.677
But here's the rub:

26:01.011 --> 26:04.014
How do we sort out the liars?

26:06.349 --> 26:08.059
Another, another.

26:09.060 --> 26:10.604
Up, up. Come on.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.314
Longbottom, is it?

26:12.981 --> 26:14.482
Up.

26:16.526 --> 26:20.322
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

26:22.282 --> 26:23.950
There's the...

26:24.159 --> 26:26.119
The Cruciatus Curse.

26:26.286 --> 26:29.122
Correct, correct. Come, come.

26:29.331 --> 26:30.957
Particularly nasty.

26:34.002 --> 26:35.837
The torture curse.

26:36.838 --> 26:39.007
Crucio!

26:51.728 --> 26:55.524
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

27:13.166 --> 27:17.170
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

27:19.589 --> 27:20.924
No?

27:22.133 --> 27:24.261
Avada Kedavra!

27:28.013 --> 27:29.557
The Killing Curse.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.852
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

27:34.395 --> 27:36.772
...and he's sitting in this room.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.139
Brilliant, isn't he?

28:10.306 --> 28:14.351
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

28:14.518 --> 28:17.688
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

28:17.855 --> 28:20.441
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

28:20.608 --> 28:24.778
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

28:27.656 --> 28:29.116
Neville?

28:29.283 --> 28:30.743
Son?

28:31.076 --> 28:32.745
You all right?

28:33.704 --> 28:37.082
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.599
We're gonna be late!

29:07.195 --> 29:09.531
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

29:25.129 --> 29:27.632
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

29:27.799 --> 29:30.468
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

29:30.635 --> 29:32.262
Yeah, rather you than me.

29:32.428 --> 29:34.347
Yes!

29:36.558 --> 29:38.476
Thank you, thank you.

29:38.643 --> 29:41.688
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

29:41.855 --> 29:44.023
It's not going to work.

29:45.233 --> 29:47.735
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

29:47.902 --> 29:50.864
You see this? This is an Age Line.

29:51.030 --> 29:52.824
Dumbledore drew it himself.

29:52.991 --> 29:54.450
So?

29:56.035 --> 29:59.664
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

29:59.831 --> 30:02.834
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

30:03.001 --> 30:07.255
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

30:09.007 --> 30:11.009
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

30:11.175 --> 30:13.011
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

30:16.431 --> 30:18.349
- Yes!
- Yes!

30:19.183 --> 30:20.685
Yeah!

30:21.853 --> 30:23.479
Yes!

30:23.897 --> 30:25.398
Ready?

30:28.693 --> 30:30.862
- Yes!
- Yes!

30:39.369 --> 30:41.371
- You said!
- You said!

30:42.331 --> 30:45.751
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

30:45.918 --> 30:48.420
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

30:48.587 --> 30:50.047
Fight! Fight! Fight!

30:55.135 --> 30:56.887
We're "old school," right?

30:57.054 --> 30:59.431
Yeah, but you look older!

31:30.796 --> 31:33.465
Sit down. Please.

31:36.885 --> 31:39.763
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

31:39.930 --> 31:42.057
The champion selection.

32:13.462 --> 32:17.300
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

32:33.232 --> 32:35.651
The champion for Beauxbatons...

32:35.818 --> 32:37.820
...is Fleur Delacour.

32:48.372 --> 32:51.375
The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!

33:01.427 --> 33:05.848
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

33:06.015 --> 33:10.186
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

33:10.353 --> 33:13.689
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

33:14.023 --> 33:17.026
...this vessel of victory...

33:17.193 --> 33:19.403
...the Triwizard Cup!

33:50.183 --> 33:51.852
Harry Potter.

33:53.937 --> 33:55.564
Harry Potter?

33:59.943 --> 34:02.153
No. No.

34:02.654 --> 34:03.947
Harry Potter!

34:04.406 --> 34:05.907
Go on, Harry.

34:06.074 --> 34:07.826
Harry, for goodness sake.

34:39.315 --> 34:40.525
He's a cheat!

34:41.067 --> 34:43.612
He's not even 17 yet!

35:11.472 --> 35:14.975
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

35:15.142 --> 35:18.145
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

35:18.312 --> 35:20.314
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

35:20.481 --> 35:21.649
- Harry.
- I protest!

35:21.815 --> 35:23.692
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

35:23.859 --> 35:26.028
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

35:26.195 --> 35:27.530
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

35:27.696 --> 35:30.616
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

35:31.033 --> 35:33.285
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

35:33.494 --> 35:35.829
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

35:35.996 --> 35:39.166
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.335
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

35:41.502 --> 35:44.505
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

35:44.672 --> 35:47.841
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

35:48.008 --> 35:51.095
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

35:52.847 --> 35:55.182
Leave this to you, Barty.

35:56.517 --> 35:58.727
The rules are absolute.

35:59.937 --> 36:03.691
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

36:05.192 --> 36:07.403
Mr. Potter has no choice.

36:08.195 --> 36:10.489
He is, as of tonight...

36:12.366 --> 36:14.368
...a Triwizard champion.

36:42.313 --> 36:44.439
This can't go on, Albus.

36:44.772 --> 36:47.609
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

36:47.775 --> 36:49.777
What do you suggest, Minerva?

36:50.945 --> 36:53.031
Put an end to it.

36:53.489 --> 36:55.491
Don't let Potter compete.

36:55.658 --> 36:58.119
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

36:58.286 --> 37:01.122
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

37:01.289 --> 37:03.750
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

37:03.917 --> 37:07.921
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

37:08.087 --> 37:12.008
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

37:12.175 --> 37:15.762
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

37:16.679 --> 37:18.932
...let them unfold.

37:19.098 --> 37:21.267
What...? Do nothing?

37:21.434 --> 37:23.102
Offer him up as bait?

37:24.103 --> 37:26.940
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

37:27.815 --> 37:30.568
I agree. With Severus.

37:31.110 --> 37:33.947
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

37:34.239 --> 37:36.699
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

37:36.950 --> 37:40.078
He must be anxious enough as it is...

37:40.620 --> 37:43.289
...knowing what lies ahead.

37:43.623 --> 37:46.209
Then again, we all are.

38:01.099 --> 38:02.892
How did you do it?

38:04.352 --> 38:06.980
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

38:07.146 --> 38:09.065
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

38:09.232 --> 38:12.485
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

38:12.652 --> 38:15.029
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

38:15.488 --> 38:17.114
Okay?

38:17.281 --> 38:19.783
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

38:19.950 --> 38:23.495
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

38:27.165 --> 38:29.167
I didn't put my name in that cup.

38:29.585 --> 38:33.422
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

38:35.173 --> 38:37.634
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

38:37.801 --> 38:39.678
...and I don't know why.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.054
It just did.

38:41.930 --> 38:43.515
Okay?

38:52.316 --> 38:54.067
Piss off.

39:09.082 --> 39:11.543
What a charismatic quartet.

39:12.878 --> 39:14.504
Hello.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.925
I'm Rita Skeeter.

39:18.508 --> 39:21.011
I write for the Daily Prophet.

39:21.595 --> 39:26.308
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

39:26.850 --> 39:28.685
You're the juicy news.

39:28.852 --> 39:33.065
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

39:33.232 --> 39:36.735
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

39:36.902 --> 39:40.113
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

39:40.280 --> 39:43.325
In short, what makes a champion tick?

39:43.825 --> 39:48.121
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

39:48.288 --> 39:50.790
So who's feeling up to sharing?

39:54.085 --> 39:56.712
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

40:08.975 --> 40:10.768
This is cozy.

40:11.352 --> 40:13.062
It's a broom cupboard.

40:13.437 --> 40:15.731
You should feel right at home, then.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.693
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

40:18.860 --> 40:20.444
No.

40:20.778 --> 40:22.780
So tell me, Harry.

40:22.947 --> 40:25.867
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

40:26.033 --> 40:27.535
I'm 14. Sorry.

40:27.702 --> 40:30.663
- About to compete
against three students...

40:30.830 --> 40:34.125
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

40:34.292 --> 40:36.878
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

40:37.044 --> 40:39.380
...in your dizziest daydreams.

40:39.881 --> 40:41.924
Concerned?

40:43.092 --> 40:45.928
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.972
Just ignore the quill.

40:48.431 --> 40:50.975
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

40:51.142 --> 40:53.728
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

40:54.478 --> 40:56.647
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

40:56.814 --> 41:00.067
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

41:00.234 --> 41:01.986
No, I didn't enter.

41:02.153 --> 41:03.779
Of course you didn't.

41:06.032 --> 41:07.658
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

41:09.994 --> 41:11.454
Scratch that last.

41:12.288 --> 41:14.957
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

41:15.124 --> 41:16.500
...how do you think they'd feel?

41:16.667 --> 41:18.419
Proud? Or concerned...

41:18.586 --> 41:22.423
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

41:22.590 --> 41:25.175
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

41:26.176 --> 41:31.264
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

42:03.547 --> 42:05.882
Harry, I couldn 't risk sending Hedwig.

42:06.049 --> 42:09.344
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

42:09.511 --> 42:11.721
...and she's too easily recognized.

42:11.888 --> 42:14.766
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

42:14.933 --> 42:19.104
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

42:19.271 --> 42:21.064
And make sure you're alone.

42:21.231 --> 42:22.732
Sirius.

42:22.899 --> 42:24.401
P. S:

42:24.568 --> 42:26.361
The bird bites.

42:36.705 --> 42:38.123
Sirius?

42:55.015 --> 42:56.932
Harry Potter, age 12...

42:57.099 --> 43:00.060
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

43:00.227 --> 43:02.813
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

43:02.980 --> 43:04.565
...and choking back tears...

43:20.039 --> 43:22.625
Sirius. How...?

43:22.791 --> 43:25.294
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

43:25.461 --> 43:28.422
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

43:28.589 --> 43:30.049
No!

43:30.633 --> 43:31.926
I had to ask.

43:32.092 --> 43:36.889
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

43:37.056 --> 43:39.475
But who was the third man in the room?

43:39.642 --> 43:42.144
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

43:42.978 --> 43:44.522
No.

43:45.439 --> 43:49.151
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

43:49.318 --> 43:50.611
And what was that?

43:52.821 --> 43:54.448
He wanted...

43:54.615 --> 43:56.283
...me.

43:56.825 --> 44:01.163
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

44:02.456 --> 44:04.542
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.627
Yes.

44:06.794 --> 44:08.337
It's just a dream.

44:09.088 --> 44:10.506
Look, Harry.

44:10.673 --> 44:14.176
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

44:14.343 --> 44:18.347
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

44:18.514 --> 44:19.598
What are you saying?

44:19.765 --> 44:24.019
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

44:24.186 --> 44:28.566
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

44:29.024 --> 44:31.568
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

44:31.734 --> 44:34.112
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

44:38.992 --> 44:41.077
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

44:41.244 --> 44:43.538
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

44:43.705 --> 44:47.709
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

44:47.876 --> 44:51.296
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

44:54.883 --> 44:57.302
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

45:00.597 --> 45:02.557
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

45:02.724 --> 45:05.143
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

45:05.435 --> 45:09.439
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

45:09.981 --> 45:13.318
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

45:39.260 --> 45:40.887
Amazing.

45:42.847 --> 45:46.559
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

45:47.101 --> 45:48.520
Right, sorry.

45:49.395 --> 45:52.398
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

45:52.565 --> 45:55.735
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

45:57.237 --> 45:58.947
It's already been through enough people.

45:59.113 --> 46:01.241
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

46:02.699 --> 46:05.035
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

46:05.202 --> 46:07.287
What do you want me to say again?

46:07.454 --> 46:08.789
Go.

46:11.750 --> 46:15.838
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

46:16.463 --> 46:20.092
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

46:20.259 --> 46:22.678
Is that right? Well, you...

46:22.845 --> 46:23.929
What?

46:29.017 --> 46:31.979
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

46:34.773 --> 46:37.734
Dean was told by Parvati that...

46:38.986 --> 46:41.196
Please don't ask me to say it again.

46:41.572 --> 46:43.031
Hagrid's looking for you.

46:43.532 --> 46:46.618
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

46:57.171 --> 46:59.423
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

46:59.590 --> 47:02.176
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

47:02.342 --> 47:03.760
You'll see soon enough.

47:03.927 --> 47:06.138
Now pay attention, this is important.

47:07.848 --> 47:09.266
What's with the flower?

47:10.350 --> 47:12.769
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

47:13.187 --> 47:14.897
As a matter of fact, I have.

47:15.355 --> 47:18.275
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

47:26.783 --> 47:28.243
Hagrid?

47:32.164 --> 47:33.999
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

47:40.588 --> 47:44.008
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

47:44.175 --> 47:47.887
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

47:48.054 --> 47:50.723
...you had forgotten me.

47:50.890 --> 47:52.850
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

47:53.518 --> 47:55.269
What is it you wanted to show me?

47:57.021 --> 48:00.233
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

48:00.566 --> 48:02.068
...exhilarated.

48:02.652 --> 48:05.488
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

48:16.082 --> 48:17.834
Can we get closer?

48:25.633 --> 48:27.093
Dragons?

48:27.260 --> 48:28.761
That's the first task?

48:29.178 --> 48:31.138
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

48:32.473 --> 48:35.518
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

48:36.602 --> 48:38.104
Oh, crikey!

48:38.646 --> 48:40.731
Although, I have to admit...

48:40.898 --> 48:43.734
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

48:43.901 --> 48:46.654
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

48:48.239 --> 48:50.283
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

48:50.449 --> 48:53.953
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.496
Didn't Ron tell you that?

48:57.498 --> 48:58.916
No, he didn't.

48:59.625 --> 49:01.502
He didn't tell me a thing.

49:11.469 --> 49:14.556
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

49:16.057 --> 49:18.727
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

49:18.894 --> 49:21.563
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

49:22.647 --> 49:24.316
Like the badge?

49:24.858 --> 49:26.610
Excuse me.

49:30.780 --> 49:32.240
Harry.

49:32.824 --> 49:34.784
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

49:34.951 --> 49:36.453
Can I have a word?

49:37.412 --> 49:39.289
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

49:39.456 --> 49:42.459
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

49:44.961 --> 49:47.506
Dragons. That's the first task.

49:47.672 --> 49:50.842
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

49:51.009 --> 49:53.011
Are you serious?

49:53.803 --> 49:56.848
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

49:57.015 --> 49:59.267
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

49:59.434 --> 50:00.894
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

50:01.061 --> 50:03.563
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

50:03.730 --> 50:06.775
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

50:06.942 --> 50:09.361
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

50:10.070 --> 50:11.530
It just happens a fair bit.

50:11.696 --> 50:14.783
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

50:14.950 --> 50:16.826
You're a right foul git, you know that?

50:16.993 --> 50:19.204
- You think so?
- I know so.

50:19.371 --> 50:20.705
Anything else?

50:20.872 --> 50:24.376
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

50:26.753 --> 50:30.382
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

50:31.132 --> 50:33.552
My father and I have a bet, you see.

50:33.718 --> 50:36.888
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

50:39.474 --> 50:42.393
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

50:42.560 --> 50:45.688
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

50:46.689 --> 50:50.693
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

50:51.610 --> 50:54.113
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

50:56.365 --> 50:59.243
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

50:59.410 --> 51:03.247
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

51:03.414 --> 51:05.166
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

51:05.332 --> 51:08.252
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

51:09.253 --> 51:13.424
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

51:19.096 --> 51:20.973
Stand still! Stand still!

51:31.942 --> 51:34.153
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

51:34.320 --> 51:36.280
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

51:36.447 --> 51:38.282
Professor!

51:38.449 --> 51:42.036
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

51:42.203 --> 51:44.914
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

51:45.080 --> 51:48.876
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

51:49.043 --> 51:51.253
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

51:51.795 --> 51:56.258
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

51:57.343 --> 51:58.802
Away!

52:01.931 --> 52:04.141
You. Come with me.

52:39.342 --> 52:41.427
That's a Foe-Glass.

52:42.178 --> 52:44.264
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

52:44.722 --> 52:49.143
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

52:53.314 --> 52:55.775
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

52:55.942 --> 52:57.986
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

52:58.236 --> 52:59.946
Now...

53:01.614 --> 53:04.450
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

53:08.371 --> 53:10.665
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

53:12.125 --> 53:13.626
Sit.

53:17.338 --> 53:18.715
Listen to me, Potter.

53:19.716 --> 53:20.884
Your pal Diggory?

53:21.050 --> 53:25.471
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

53:26.681 --> 53:27.932
Miss Delacour?

53:28.349 --> 53:31.060
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

53:31.561 --> 53:35.148
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

53:35.315 --> 53:37.483
...but Karkaroff's is not.

53:37.650 --> 53:39.485
They'll have a strategy.

53:39.652 --> 53:43.114
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

53:47.952 --> 53:49.536
Come on, Potter.

53:49.703 --> 53:51.788
What are your strengths?

53:53.373 --> 53:54.750
I don't know.

53:54.917 --> 53:57.711
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

53:57.878 --> 54:01.924
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

54:02.090 --> 54:05.719
You're allowed a wand.

54:12.142 --> 54:13.602
Bets! Place your bets!

54:13.769 --> 54:15.938
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

54:16.104 --> 54:19.066
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

54:19.233 --> 54:22.027
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

54:22.277 --> 54:23.779
Yes, sir?

54:24.112 --> 54:26.782
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

54:27.324 --> 54:29.284
Your attention, please.

54:29.493 --> 54:32.120
This is a great day for all of us.

54:35.541 --> 54:39.795
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

54:39.962 --> 54:42.631
Please keep your seats at all times.

54:42.798 --> 54:45.551
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

54:45.717 --> 54:49.137
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

54:49.304 --> 54:51.014
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

54:51.181 --> 54:54.268
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

54:56.562 --> 54:59.982
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

55:00.148 --> 55:01.984
Battle a dragon.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.740
Young love.

55:09.491 --> 55:10.742
How...

55:13.203 --> 55:14.496
...stirring.

55:17.166 --> 55:20.335
If everything goes unfortunately today...

55:20.502 --> 55:23.296
...you two may even
make the front page.

55:23.462 --> 55:25.673
You have no business here.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.842
This tent is for champions...

55:28.217 --> 55:29.927
...and friends.

55:32.722 --> 55:36.893
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

55:40.021 --> 55:42.857
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

55:43.024 --> 55:47.195
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

55:47.361 --> 55:50.615
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

55:50.781 --> 55:52.909
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

55:54.202 --> 55:55.870
Sorry, I'll just go.

55:56.037 --> 55:57.580
Barty, the bag.

55:58.039 --> 56:00.249
Champions, in a circle around me.

56:00.416 --> 56:03.544
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

56:03.711 --> 56:07.632
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

56:07.798 --> 56:10.218
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

56:14.305 --> 56:15.973
The Welsh Green.

56:20.603 --> 56:21.896
Mr. Krum.

56:24.899 --> 56:26.817
The Chinese Fireball.

56:33.282 --> 56:35.701
The Swedish Short-Snout.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.162
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

56:38.329 --> 56:40.581
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

56:44.001 --> 56:46.420
The Hungarian Horntail.

56:48.589 --> 56:51.717
These represent four
very real dragons...

56:51.884 --> 56:54.928
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

56:55.095 --> 56:57.597
Your objective is simple:

56:57.764 --> 56:59.266
Collect the egg.

56:59.432 --> 57:02.435
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

57:02.602 --> 57:06.106
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

57:06.273 --> 57:07.607
Any questions?

57:08.608 --> 57:11.278
Very well. Good luck, champions.

57:11.444 --> 57:14.239
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

57:22.914 --> 57:26.751
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

57:38.305 --> 57:41.683
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

57:41.850 --> 57:45.353
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

57:45.937 --> 57:49.024
And now our fourth
and final contestant.

57:50.984 --> 57:54.571
Harry! Harry! Harry!

59:01.679 --> 59:04.598
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

59:05.099 --> 59:07.142
Accio Firebolt!

59:36.130 --> 59:38.299
- Yeah!
- Yes!

59:47.224 --> 59:48.642
Oh, my God.

59:58.277 --> 01:00:01.571
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:35.766
Yes! Yes!

01:02:58.956 --> 01:03:01.667
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.

01:03:01.834 --> 01:03:03.794
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:05.712
- Never!
- Never!

01:03:07.797 --> 01:03:09.131
Shush!

01:03:09.632 --> 01:03:12.301
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

01:03:13.302 --> 01:03:16.138
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

01:03:16.973 --> 01:03:19.475
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

01:03:30.653 --> 01:03:33.072
What the bloody hell was that?

01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:39.954
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

01:03:40.121 --> 01:03:44.167
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

01:03:47.336 --> 01:03:51.257
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

01:03:51.674 --> 01:03:54.385
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

01:03:55.511 --> 01:03:57.638
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

01:03:57.805 --> 01:04:00.057
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.

01:04:02.268 --> 01:04:05.521
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

01:04:06.439 --> 01:04:09.817
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

01:04:09.984 --> 01:04:11.486
No, no, no, I did.

01:04:11.652 --> 01:04:14.697
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

01:04:14.864 --> 01:04:18.910
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:23.039
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.043
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

01:04:27.251 --> 01:04:29.253
...after you'd figured that out.

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:32.298
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

01:04:32.965 --> 01:04:34.383
That's completely mental.

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:37.595
Yeah. Isn't it?

01:04:37.762 --> 01:04:39.805
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:44.100
Boys.

01:05:08.583 --> 01:05:10.001
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:16.258
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

01:05:20.178 --> 01:05:21.888
Shush.

01:05:22.597 --> 01:05:23.932
Look at this!

01:05:25.934 --> 01:05:28.436
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:31.731
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

01:05:31.898 --> 01:05:34.651
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

01:05:34.818 --> 01:05:37.112
Her latest prey, sources report...

01:05:37.279 --> 01:05:40.907
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

01:05:41.199 --> 01:05:45.120
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

01:05:46.496 --> 01:05:48.456
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

01:05:48.623 --> 01:05:50.125
Thank you, Nigel.

01:05:54.921 --> 01:05:57.757
Not now, Nigel. Later.

01:05:59.593 --> 01:06:01.136
Go on.

01:06:06.474 --> 01:06:09.227
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:13.189
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

01:06:21.322 --> 01:06:23.157
Mum sent me a dress.

01:06:23.324 --> 01:06:27.161
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.455
Nose down, Harry.

01:06:29.997 --> 01:06:33.876
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

01:06:35.669 --> 01:06:37.505
What are you on about?

01:06:37.671 --> 01:06:39.632
They're not for Ginny.

01:06:39.798 --> 01:06:41.133
They're for you.

01:06:42.176 --> 01:06:45.930
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

01:06:47.181 --> 01:06:49.350
The Yule Ball...

01:06:49.517 --> 01:06:54.855
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

01:06:55.564 --> 01:06:57.650
...since its inception.

01:06:58.317 --> 01:07:02.196
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

01:07:02.363 --> 01:07:04.031
...gather in the Great Hall...

01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:08.244
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

01:07:09.787 --> 01:07:12.039
As representatives of the host school...

01:07:12.206 --> 01:07:17.253
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

01:07:17.628 --> 01:07:20.256
And I mean this literally, because...

01:07:20.422 --> 01:07:24.885
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

01:07:25.719 --> 01:07:27.221
...a dance.

01:07:31.475 --> 01:07:33.269
Silence!

01:07:33.477 --> 01:07:36.480
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

01:07:36.647 --> 01:07:39.275
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

01:07:39.441 --> 01:07:43.529
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

01:07:43.696 --> 01:07:47.907
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

01:07:48.616 --> 01:07:50.577
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

01:07:50.743 --> 01:07:52.245
Now, to dance...

01:07:52.412 --> 01:07:56.124
...is to let the body breathe.

01:07:56.291 --> 01:07:59.627
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

01:07:59.794 --> 01:08:02.172
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

01:08:02.338 --> 01:08:06.342
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

01:08:06.509 --> 01:08:09.637
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:12.056
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

01:08:12.223 --> 01:08:14.642
Will you join me, please?

01:08:19.272 --> 01:08:22.774
Now, place your right hand
on my waist.

01:08:22.942 --> 01:08:25.528
- Where?
- My waist.

01:08:25.694 --> 01:08:28.238
And extend your arm.

01:08:28.698 --> 01:08:30.658
Mr. Filch, if you please.

01:08:33.745 --> 01:08:35.747
One, two, three.

01:08:35.913 --> 01:08:39.417
One, two, three. One, two, three.

01:08:43.129 --> 01:08:45.256
Never gonna let him forget this,
are you?

01:08:45.423 --> 01:08:46.591
- Never.
- Never.

01:08:46.758 --> 01:08:50.636
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:15.662
Why do they have to travel in packs?

01:09:15.828 --> 01:09:18.456
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

01:09:26.337 --> 01:09:29.841
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

01:09:30.008 --> 01:09:32.261
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:40.018
I take after my mum.

01:09:40.185 --> 01:09:44.148
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:46.233
No, not the maternal sort, her.

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:49.987
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

01:09:50.154 --> 01:09:54.700
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

01:09:54.867 --> 01:09:57.202
He laughed so hard at that.

01:09:59.246 --> 01:10:01.123
Very funny.

01:10:07.045 --> 01:10:10.799
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

01:10:10.966 --> 01:10:14.011
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

01:10:14.428 --> 01:10:16.597
But enough of me. What about you?

01:10:33.864 --> 01:10:38.952
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

01:10:41.246 --> 01:10:43.957
Well, us and Neville.

01:10:44.124 --> 01:10:46.793
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:50.881
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

01:10:53.341 --> 01:10:55.092
Now I'm really depressed.

01:11:00.932 --> 01:11:04.352
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

01:11:06.437 --> 01:11:08.439
Who you going with, then?

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:12.860
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

01:11:13.027 --> 01:11:18.324
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

01:11:18.658 --> 01:11:20.409
To the ball?

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.994
Yeah, all right.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.291
Oi, Hermione.

01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:29.126
You're a girl.

01:11:29.293 --> 01:11:30.628
Very well spotted.

01:11:30.795 --> 01:11:32.713
Come with one of us?

01:11:37.343 --> 01:11:40.263
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:41.931
For a girl, it's just sad.

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:45.852
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

01:11:52.817 --> 01:11:54.819
And I said yes!

01:11:56.654 --> 01:11:58.239
Bloody hell.

01:11:58.406 --> 01:12:00.074
She's lying, right?

01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:01.450
If you say so.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.496
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

01:12:05.663 --> 01:12:07.748
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room...

01:12:07.915 --> 01:12:09.625
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:11.294
Agreed.

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:36.985
- Cho!
- Harry!

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:43.283
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:45.035
Okay, thanks.

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:50.540
Cho?

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.043
Yes?

01:12:54.419 --> 01:12:56.671
Well, I just wondered if you...

01:12:56.838 --> 01:12:59.591
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

01:13:01.301 --> 01:13:03.553
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

01:13:04.471 --> 01:13:09.392
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

01:13:15.398 --> 01:13:16.983
Harry...

01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:19.986
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:22.405
And...

01:13:23.073 --> 01:13:26.326
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

01:13:27.994 --> 01:13:30.497
Okay. Yeah. Great.

01:13:31.873 --> 01:13:34.584
Fine. No problem.

01:13:34.918 --> 01:13:36.503
Okay. Good.

01:13:37.963 --> 01:13:39.506
Harry?

01:13:40.131 --> 01:13:41.925
I really am...

01:13:42.092 --> 01:13:43.760
...sorry.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.021
It's all right, Ron.

01:13:55.188 --> 01:13:58.400
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.442
What happened to you?

01:14:00.693 --> 01:14:02.862
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

01:14:03.028 --> 01:14:05.531
- What?
- What did she say?

01:14:05.698 --> 01:14:07.074
No, of course.

01:14:08.617 --> 01:14:11.954
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

01:14:12.371 --> 01:14:16.792
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

01:14:17.543 --> 01:14:21.172
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

01:14:21.338 --> 01:14:24.758
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

01:14:25.968 --> 01:14:29.597
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

01:14:29.763 --> 01:14:33.476
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

01:14:33.642 --> 01:14:34.894
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:38.147
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

01:14:39.482 --> 01:14:42.026
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:43.652
Hey!

01:15:00.753 --> 01:15:02.463
Bloody hell.

01:15:04.673 --> 01:15:06.467
Bloody hell.

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.263
Bloody...

01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:12.640
Oh, bloody...

01:15:16.352 --> 01:15:19.063
What are those? What are those?

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:22.274
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:25.361
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

01:15:25.528 --> 01:15:27.530
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

01:15:27.696 --> 01:15:32.617
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

01:15:35.036 --> 01:15:38.122
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

01:15:42.877 --> 01:15:44.712
Murder me, Harry.

01:15:46.089 --> 01:15:47.674
Leave it alone!

01:15:48.633 --> 01:15:52.053
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.722
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

01:15:54.889 --> 01:15:58.476
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

01:15:58.643 --> 01:16:00.854
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:06.109
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

01:16:07.068 --> 01:16:08.486
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

01:16:08.653 --> 01:16:10.488
Don't you look...

01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:12.240
...dashing.

01:16:12.824 --> 01:16:15.994
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

01:16:16.161 --> 01:16:17.996
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

01:16:18.163 --> 01:16:21.207
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

01:16:21.374 --> 01:16:22.417
- Are the first to dance.

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:25.336
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

01:16:25.962 --> 01:16:27.714
Well, now you know.

01:16:29.716 --> 01:16:33.511
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

01:16:33.678 --> 01:16:36.014
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

01:16:36.222 --> 01:16:37.765
Come along this way.

01:16:42.604 --> 01:16:44.439
Oh, come on.

01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:47.275
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

01:16:47.442 --> 01:16:50.820
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:55.450
This way. This way. Come along.

01:16:57.118 --> 01:16:59.370
She looks beautiful!

01:16:59.537 --> 01:17:01.122
Yeah, she does.

01:17:48.502 --> 01:17:52.089
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

01:17:52.714 --> 01:17:55.300
No. Absolutely not.

01:18:00.013 --> 01:18:01.557
Hi!

01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:12.359
Harry, take my waist.

01:18:13.277 --> 01:18:14.653
- What?
- Now!

01:19:21.302 --> 01:19:23.012
Are you ready?

01:19:23.679 --> 01:19:25.890
Move your body like a hairy troll

01:19:26.724 --> 01:19:29.185
Learning to rock and roll

01:19:29.602 --> 01:19:32.146
Spin around like a crazy elf

01:19:32.688 --> 01:19:34.899
Dancing by himself

01:19:35.233 --> 01:19:38.569
Boogie down like a unicorn

01:19:38.736 --> 01:19:41.197
No stopping till the break of dawn

01:19:41.364 --> 01:19:44.200
Put your hands up in the air

01:19:44.367 --> 01:19:47.119
Like an ogre who just don 't care

01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:50.540
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:55.002
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

01:19:57.213 --> 01:20:00.633
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

01:20:02.552 --> 01:20:04.095
May I have your arm?

01:20:04.262 --> 01:20:06.973
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

01:20:32.914 --> 01:20:34.457
Hot, isn't it?

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:38.503
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:42.340
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

01:20:44.050 --> 01:20:46.344
What's got your wand in a knot?

01:20:46.678 --> 01:20:50.348
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

01:20:50.515 --> 01:20:54.102
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

01:20:54.811 --> 01:20:57.272
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

01:20:57.439 --> 01:21:00.942
...is international
magical cooperation...

01:21:01.526 --> 01:21:02.986
...to make friends.

01:21:03.778 --> 01:21:06.948
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

01:21:16.917 --> 01:21:19.211
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

01:21:19.419 --> 01:21:20.795
No.

01:21:29.095 --> 01:21:31.473
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:35.894
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:39.731
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

01:21:39.898 --> 01:21:42.025
You know the solution then, don't you?

01:21:42.192 --> 01:21:44.152
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

01:21:44.361 --> 01:21:47.446
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

01:21:47.655 --> 01:21:49.698
And not as a last resort.

01:21:49.865 --> 01:21:54.078
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

01:21:54.245 --> 01:21:55.538
Harry.

01:21:56.038 --> 01:21:57.289
Where have you been?

01:21:57.498 --> 01:21:59.959
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

01:22:02.837 --> 01:22:06.841
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

01:22:07.007 --> 01:22:08.884
What's this about?

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:16.183
No, don 't let

01:22:17.977 --> 01:22:22.273
This magic die

01:22:24.066 --> 01:22:26.819
The answer's there

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:27.212
Let me see it again.

01:23:28.588 --> 01:23:31.424
Yes, the time is close now.

01:23:36.179 --> 01:23:37.972
Harry, at last!

01:23:39.349 --> 01:23:44.687
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

01:23:55.281 --> 01:23:56.658
You all right, Harry?

01:23:58.117 --> 01:23:59.911
I just got in.

01:24:00.495 --> 01:24:01.704
Me.

01:24:13.007 --> 01:24:16.261
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

01:24:16.469 --> 01:24:20.598
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

01:24:22.183 --> 01:24:23.977
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

01:24:24.144 --> 01:24:26.980
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:32.819
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

01:24:36.531 --> 01:24:39.701
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

01:24:40.201 --> 01:24:42.412
Mostly, he watches me study.

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:45.290
It's a bit annoying, actually.

01:24:46.708 --> 01:24:49.419
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:51.712
What's that supposed to mean?

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:55.340
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:58.677
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:01.472
And...

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:05.684
...I'm scared for you.

01:25:06.643 --> 01:25:09.188
You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:12.316
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:14.151
Hey, Potter!

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:21.408
- Potter!
- Cedric.

01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:25.787
How...? How are you?

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.248
Spectacular.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:33.670
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:36.131
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:38.008
Exactly.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.595
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:48.101
It's not a bad place for a bath.

01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:52.397
Just take your egg...

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.901
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

01:26:31.102 --> 01:26:33.229
I must be out of my mind.

01:26:43.447 --> 01:26:45.575
I'm definitely out of my mind.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:51.539
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

01:26:51.747 --> 01:26:53.624
Myrtle!

01:26:53.791 --> 01:26:55.501
Hello, Harry.

01:26:56.335 --> 01:26:59.505
Long time no see.

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:07.472
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

01:27:07.638 --> 01:27:11.058
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

01:27:11.267 --> 01:27:13.561
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

01:27:13.769 --> 01:27:15.480
Polyjuice Potion?

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:20.318
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:28.784
That's what he did.

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.287
The other boy...

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.790
...the handsome one...

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:37.418
...Cedric.

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:43.424
Well, go on. Open it.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:56.479
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

01:27:56.687 --> 01:28:01.316
We cannot sing
Above the ground

01:28:01.525 --> 01:28:05.821
An hour long you'll have to look

01:28:06.655 --> 01:28:11.284
To recover what we took

01:28:19.501 --> 01:28:20.961
Myrtle...

01:28:22.379 --> 01:28:25.799
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

01:28:26.716 --> 01:28:28.343
Very good.

01:28:29.261 --> 01:28:33.640
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:37.894
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

01:28:55.579 --> 01:28:57.539
Harry, tell me again.

01:28:59.249 --> 01:29:02.085
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

01:29:02.252 --> 01:29:04.754
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

01:29:05.755 --> 01:29:08.258
"An hour long you'll have to look."

01:29:08.467 --> 01:29:11.887
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

01:29:13.305 --> 01:29:15.182
"Potentially problematic"?

01:29:15.348 --> 01:29:18.602
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

01:29:19.144 --> 01:29:23.440
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

01:29:23.648 --> 01:29:26.109
Hate to break up the skull session.

01:29:26.318 --> 01:29:28.278
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

01:29:28.570 --> 01:29:30.946
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

01:29:31.113 --> 01:29:33.782
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

01:29:33.949 --> 01:29:36.535
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

01:29:36.744 --> 01:29:38.621
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

01:29:38.787 --> 01:29:41.248
Go. Now!

01:29:51.258 --> 01:29:53.052
Longbottom!

01:29:53.219 --> 01:29:55.179
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

01:30:03.896 --> 01:30:06.106
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

01:30:06.273 --> 01:30:08.818
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

01:30:09.485 --> 01:30:13.781
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

01:30:13.948 --> 01:30:17.701
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

01:30:18.327 --> 01:30:20.037
...about plants.

01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:22.081
Now, if there's...

01:30:22.248 --> 01:30:27.044
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

01:30:27.211 --> 01:30:29.672
...then great. But otherwise...

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:33.634
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

01:30:34.927 --> 01:30:37.763
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:39.390
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

01:30:39.557 --> 01:30:41.016
- Three lads.
- One lady.

01:30:41.183 --> 01:30:43.310
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

01:30:43.519 --> 01:30:44.979
Don't be so mean.

01:30:45.646 --> 01:30:47.439
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:51.610
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

01:30:51.819 --> 01:30:53.696
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

01:30:53.904 --> 01:30:55.364
Most likely?

01:30:55.573 --> 01:30:57.783
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

01:30:57.950 --> 01:31:00.411
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

01:31:00.578 --> 01:31:03.246
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

01:31:03.413 --> 01:31:05.373
I just wanted to help.

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:08.626
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

01:31:08.835 --> 01:31:10.545
Where are they anyway?

01:31:10.753 --> 01:31:13.756
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

01:31:20.805 --> 01:31:23.016
Welcome to the second task.

01:31:23.224 --> 01:31:26.895
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

01:31:27.061 --> 01:31:28.438
A treasure of sorts.

01:31:28.605 --> 01:31:31.232
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

01:31:31.399 --> 01:31:34.068
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

01:31:34.277 --> 01:31:35.820
In order to win...

01:31:36.029 --> 01:31:39.866
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

01:31:40.033 --> 01:31:42.660
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

01:31:42.827 --> 01:31:46.414
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

01:31:46.623 --> 01:31:50.460
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

01:31:51.044 --> 01:31:53.254
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

01:32:19.823 --> 01:32:22.742
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

01:32:24.118 --> 01:32:27.038
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

01:32:28.957 --> 01:32:30.834
Yeah!

01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:33.628
What?

01:33:53.207 --> 01:33:55.334
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

01:33:55.542 --> 01:33:58.003
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

01:33:58.712 --> 01:34:01.799
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

01:35:19.584 --> 01:35:21.377
But she's my friend too!

01:35:23.004 --> 01:35:24.714
Only one!

01:36:16.097 --> 01:36:17.974
Let's get down below.

01:36:28.026 --> 01:36:30.862
Krum! Krum! Krum!

01:37:28.335 --> 01:37:30.045
Yes!

01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:50.232
Ascendio!

01:37:55.488 --> 01:37:57.198
Harry!

01:37:59.492 --> 01:38:00.951
He's all right.

01:38:02.161 --> 01:38:03.621
He's all right. Barty!

01:38:03.788 --> 01:38:07.208
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

01:38:07.792 --> 01:38:11.212
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

01:38:11.962 --> 01:38:13.589
My little sister.

01:38:14.048 --> 01:38:15.591
Thank you.

01:38:16.425 --> 01:38:19.136
And you! You helped.

01:38:19.804 --> 01:38:22.807
Well, yeah, a bit.

01:38:30.022 --> 01:38:31.190
- Harry!
- Hermione!

01:38:31.357 --> 01:38:34.026
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

01:38:35.277 --> 01:38:37.154
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

01:38:37.363 --> 01:38:39.406
I finished last, Hermione.

01:38:40.241 --> 01:38:44.370
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

01:38:44.537 --> 01:38:47.790
Krum! Krum! Krum!

01:38:47.957 --> 01:38:50.792
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

01:38:53.169 --> 01:38:55.755
Attention!

01:38:56.256 --> 01:39:00.093
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

01:39:00.552 --> 01:39:04.055
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

01:39:04.222 --> 01:39:06.891
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

01:39:07.058 --> 01:39:12.021
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

01:39:12.188 --> 01:39:16.484
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

01:39:16.651 --> 01:39:18.611
...second place...

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:20.280
- Second place!
- Well done!

01:39:20.447 --> 01:39:23.116
...for outstanding moral fiber!

01:39:24.367 --> 01:39:25.910
Yes!

01:39:29.414 --> 01:39:31.207
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

01:39:31.374 --> 01:39:33.001
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

01:39:33.209 --> 01:39:35.503
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

01:39:35.712 --> 01:39:38.381
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

01:39:38.548 --> 01:39:40.175
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

01:39:40.383 --> 01:39:41.926
Well done, boy.

01:39:42.093 --> 01:39:45.346
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

01:39:45.513 --> 01:39:49.476
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

01:39:50.518 --> 01:39:53.938
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

01:39:54.147 --> 01:39:56.107
...to lose one's family.

01:39:58.151 --> 01:40:00.278
Never whole again, are we?

01:40:02.572 --> 01:40:04.616
Still, life goes on...

01:40:05.325 --> 01:40:06.951
...and here we stand.

01:40:09.913 --> 01:40:12.582
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

01:40:12.749 --> 01:40:14.209
Bartemius!

01:40:14.417 --> 01:40:18.546
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

01:40:18.713 --> 01:40:22.132
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

01:40:34.394 --> 01:40:36.271
And they say I'm mad.

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:49.243
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:52.454
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

01:40:52.996 --> 01:40:55.541
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:59.795
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

01:40:59.962 --> 01:41:03.298
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

01:41:03.465 --> 01:41:05.008
And Harry, of course.

01:41:05.175 --> 01:41:10.556
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

01:41:10.764 --> 01:41:12.808
Hooray!

01:41:14.226 --> 01:41:16.687
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

01:41:16.895 --> 01:41:19.481
Teach us something, please

01:41:29.491 --> 01:41:30.951
Mr. Crouch?

01:41:38.083 --> 01:41:41.670
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

01:41:41.837 --> 01:41:43.380
I will not.

01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:47.634
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

01:41:47.843 --> 01:41:49.219
Then for once show them some!

01:41:49.386 --> 01:41:53.432
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

01:41:53.599 --> 01:41:56.767
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

01:41:56.976 --> 01:41:59.729
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:41:59.937 --> 01:42:03.608
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

01:42:07.945 --> 01:42:09.489
Oh, Harry!

01:42:09.697 --> 01:42:11.991
Harry, how good to see you again.

01:42:12.825 --> 01:42:14.285
I can come back later, professor.

01:42:14.494 --> 01:42:17.830
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

01:42:18.039 --> 01:42:20.541
Minister, after you.

01:42:21.125 --> 01:42:23.085
There you are. Your hat.

01:42:23.294 --> 01:42:26.964
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:30.301
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

01:44:01.808 --> 01:44:03.351
Professor?

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:06.062
- Professor.
- Yeah.

01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:20.744
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

01:44:20.952 --> 01:44:22.829
...to present evidence to this council.

01:44:23.038 --> 01:44:25.749
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

01:44:25.916 --> 01:44:29.961
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:34.716
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

01:44:34.925 --> 01:44:36.551
Do you accept these terms?

01:44:37.177 --> 01:44:39.846
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

01:44:40.222 --> 01:44:42.682
I have names, sir.

01:44:43.225 --> 01:44:46.812
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

01:44:49.523 --> 01:44:51.983
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

01:44:52.192 --> 01:44:54.319
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

01:44:54.528 --> 01:44:57.114
- If that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

01:44:57.322 --> 01:45:00.575
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

01:45:00.784 --> 01:45:03.160
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

01:45:03.327 --> 01:45:04.495
Yeah, the same.

01:45:04.662 --> 01:45:08.332
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

01:45:09.583 --> 01:45:12.837
Very well. Council will deliberate.

01:45:13.045 --> 01:45:15.005
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

01:45:15.172 --> 01:45:19.885
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

01:45:20.052 --> 01:45:23.055
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

01:45:23.222 --> 01:45:27.143
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

01:45:27.351 --> 01:45:30.354
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

01:45:30.521 --> 01:45:33.941
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

01:45:34.150 --> 01:45:36.360
Silence!

01:45:37.027 --> 01:45:40.448
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

01:45:40.614 --> 01:45:42.741
...this session is now concluded.

01:45:42.908 --> 01:45:44.952
Oh, no, no, no.

01:45:45.911 --> 01:45:47.371
I've heard about one more.

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.082
- What's that?
- The name.

01:45:50.291 --> 01:45:51.750
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

01:45:51.917 --> 01:45:53.961
...this person took part
in the capture...

01:45:54.128 --> 01:45:56.255
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

01:45:56.464 --> 01:45:59.967
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

01:46:00.134 --> 01:46:02.428
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

01:46:02.636 --> 01:46:05.181
Barty Crouch...

01:46:07.892 --> 01:46:08.893
...Junior.

01:46:18.402 --> 01:46:20.112
Hold him down!

01:46:23.741 --> 01:46:27.328
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

01:46:29.079 --> 01:46:30.623
Hello, Father.

01:46:32.082 --> 01:46:34.126
You are no son of mine.

01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:49.933
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

01:46:51.309 --> 01:46:52.685
It's a Pensieve.

01:46:52.852 --> 01:46:57.482
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

01:46:57.690 --> 01:47:01.194
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

01:47:01.694 --> 01:47:04.614
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

01:47:04.823 --> 01:47:06.366
...some small detail...

01:47:07.826 --> 01:47:09.953
...something I might have overlooked...

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.332
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:18.962
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

01:47:20.046 --> 01:47:21.673
It's maddening.

01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:25.760
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

01:47:26.511 --> 01:47:28.555
What exactly happened to him?

01:47:28.763 --> 01:47:33.560
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

01:47:34.227 --> 01:47:37.814
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

01:47:39.315 --> 01:47:42.235
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

01:47:43.027 --> 01:47:45.155
I had a dream about him.

01:47:47.407 --> 01:47:50.160
It was in the summer, before school.

01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:55.373
In the dream, I was in a house.

01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:00.336
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.

01:48:00.503 --> 01:48:04.090
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch 's son.

01:48:04.507 --> 01:48:07.343
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

01:48:08.177 --> 01:48:09.803
Always the same one.

01:48:12.848 --> 01:48:15.142
Sir, these dreams...

01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:20.564
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:25.152
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

01:48:25.652 --> 01:48:27.613
I think it's best if you simply...

01:48:33.243 --> 01:48:35.037
...cast them away.

01:48:44.296 --> 01:48:48.217
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

01:48:56.975 --> 01:48:58.143
Potter!

01:48:58.352 --> 01:49:00.854
What's your hurry?

01:49:05.984 --> 01:49:09.738
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

01:49:09.947 --> 01:49:12.157
Gillyweed, am I correct?

01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:14.493
Yes, sir.

01:49:15.452 --> 01:49:16.829
Ingenious.

01:49:18.664 --> 01:49:22.584
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:26.964
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

01:49:28.632 --> 01:49:30.592
Nor is this.

01:49:34.805 --> 01:49:36.431
Know what it is?

01:49:37.766 --> 01:49:39.143
Bubble juice, sir?

01:49:39.768 --> 01:49:41.644
Veritaserum.

01:49:42.395 --> 01:49:46.065
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

01:49:46.274 --> 01:49:51.404
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

01:49:52.113 --> 01:49:55.116
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

01:49:55.324 --> 01:50:00.121
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

01:50:00.329 --> 01:50:04.709
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

01:50:05.877 --> 01:50:11.549
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.636
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

01:50:15.803 --> 01:50:18.014
...I'm going to find out why!

01:50:44.832 --> 01:50:46.375
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:51:05.603 --> 01:51:07.146
Sonorus!

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:16.738
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

01:51:16.905 --> 01:51:21.868
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

01:51:23.954 --> 01:51:25.747
...and Mr. Potter...

01:51:27.624 --> 01:51:29.334
...are tied for first position...

01:51:29.543 --> 01:51:33.672
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

01:51:34.923 --> 01:51:38.343
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

01:51:39.302 --> 01:51:42.305
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

01:51:46.685 --> 01:51:49.438
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

01:51:49.604 --> 01:51:52.524
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

01:51:52.691 --> 01:51:57.154
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

01:51:57.529 --> 01:52:01.450
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

01:52:04.578 --> 01:52:08.874
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

01:52:09.082 --> 01:52:12.419
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

01:52:12.627 --> 01:52:15.630
You see, people change in the maze.

01:52:15.797 --> 01:52:17.507
Oh, find the cup if you can.

01:52:17.674 --> 01:52:22.471
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:26.933
Champions, prepare yourselves!

01:52:35.984 --> 01:52:37.444
Good luck.

01:52:37.819 --> 01:52:39.780
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

01:52:42.157 --> 01:52:44.701
On the count of three. One...

01:56:12.531 --> 01:56:13.699
Fleur?

01:56:15.409 --> 01:56:16.869
Fleur.

01:56:20.414 --> 01:56:22.207
Periculum!

01:57:00.913 --> 01:57:02.372
Get down!

01:57:02.956 --> 01:57:04.666
Get down!

01:57:05.334 --> 01:57:06.585
Expelliarmus!

01:57:16.178 --> 01:57:19.348
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

01:57:19.556 --> 01:57:21.600
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

01:57:33.277 --> 01:57:34.904
Yes.

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.593
Harry!

01:57:59.929 --> 01:58:01.556
Harry!

01:58:03.933 --> 01:58:05.309
Harry!

01:58:07.812 --> 01:58:09.355
Harry!

01:58:11.399 --> 01:58:13.109
Reducto!

01:58:29.959 --> 01:58:32.420
- Thanks.
- No problem.

01:58:32.837 --> 01:58:37.550
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

01:58:37.717 --> 01:58:39.427
For a moment, so did I.

01:58:41.345 --> 01:58:42.513
Some game, huh?

01:58:43.514 --> 01:58:44.891
Some game.

01:58:50.354 --> 01:58:51.981
Go!

01:59:02.157 --> 01:59:05.160
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

01:59:05.368 --> 01:59:07.329
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

01:59:07.537 --> 01:59:08.705
...three!
...three!

01:59:21.259 --> 01:59:24.096
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

01:59:31.228 --> 01:59:32.562
Where are we?

01:59:38.235 --> 01:59:39.861
I've been here before.

01:59:43.532 --> 01:59:45.075
It's a Portkey.

01:59:46.952 --> 01:59:51.164
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:56.586
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

01:59:56.795 --> 01:59:58.755
What are you talking about?

02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:06.930
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

02:00:14.563 --> 02:00:16.857
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

02:00:17.065 --> 02:00:19.818
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

02:00:31.121 --> 02:00:32.997
Do it! Now!

02:00:44.967 --> 02:00:47.428
Bone of the father...

02:00:47.636 --> 02:00:50.556
...unwillingly given.

02:00:57.396 --> 02:01:00.399
Flesh of the servant...

02:01:02.485 --> 02:01:05.654
...willingly sacrificed.

02:01:09.742 --> 02:01:13.496
And blood of the enemy...

02:01:19.293 --> 02:01:21.754
...forcibly taken.

02:01:27.843 --> 02:01:30.763
The Dark Lord shall rise...

02:01:31.555 --> 02:01:33.516
...again.

02:02:36.911 --> 02:02:40.248
My wand, Wormtail.

02:02:49.841 --> 02:02:51.801
Hold out your arm.

02:02:51.968 --> 02:02:53.595
Master.

02:02:53.762 --> 02:02:56.347
Thank you, master.

02:02:56.556 --> 02:02:58.016
The other arm, Wormtail.

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:40.516
Welcome, my friends.

02:03:41.975 --> 02:03:44.728
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

02:03:45.354 --> 02:03:50.859
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

02:03:51.819 --> 02:03:54.738
I confess myself...

02:03:55.197 --> 02:03:56.740
...disappointed.

02:03:57.449 --> 02:03:59.493
Not one of you tried to find me.

02:03:59.701 --> 02:04:03.038
Crabbe! Macnair!

02:04:03.997 --> 02:04:05.332
Goyle!

02:04:07.835 --> 02:04:09.461
Not even you...

02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.217
...Lucius.

02:04:17.094 --> 02:04:21.890
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

02:04:22.099 --> 02:04:25.102
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

02:04:25.269 --> 02:04:30.399
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

02:04:32.151 --> 02:04:37.739
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

02:04:39.783 --> 02:04:42.369
...that is my true mask.

02:04:42.786 --> 02:04:44.329
I returned.

02:04:46.832 --> 02:04:50.669
Out of fear, not loyalty.

02:04:51.879 --> 02:04:57.634
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

02:05:02.848 --> 02:05:05.142
Thank you, master.

02:05:05.768 --> 02:05:07.478
Thank you.

02:05:10.606 --> 02:05:12.982
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

02:05:14.442 --> 02:05:15.902
Harry.

02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:18.863
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

02:05:19.071 --> 02:05:23.451
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

02:05:23.659 --> 02:05:25.036
I'd introduce you...

02:05:25.203 --> 02:05:29.499
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

02:05:32.168 --> 02:05:34.837
The boy who lived.

02:05:35.004 --> 02:05:37.924
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

02:05:38.091 --> 02:05:42.095
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

02:05:42.261 --> 02:05:46.974
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

02:05:47.141 --> 02:05:48.601
Yes, shall I?

02:05:49.102 --> 02:05:50.436
It was love.

02:05:50.603 --> 02:05:55.066
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

02:05:55.274 --> 02:05:57.819
...she provided the ultimate protection.

02:05:58.277 --> 02:06:00.071
I could not touch him.

02:06:01.280 --> 02:06:03.407
It was old magic.

02:06:03.616 --> 02:06:05.827
Something I should have foreseen.

02:06:06.035 --> 02:06:07.829
But no matter, no matter.

02:06:07.995 --> 02:06:10.206
Things have changed.

02:06:10.957 --> 02:06:14.460
I can touch you...

02:06:15.086 --> 02:06:16.796
...now.

02:06:24.971 --> 02:06:26.305
Yeah.

02:06:32.645 --> 02:06:36.315
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

02:06:37.525 --> 02:06:39.152
Pick up your wand, Potter.

02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:43.030
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

02:06:44.657 --> 02:06:46.950
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

02:06:47.117 --> 02:06:49.494
First, we bow to each other.

02:06:49.703 --> 02:06:52.080
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

02:06:52.289 --> 02:06:55.459
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

02:06:55.667 --> 02:06:57.002
I said, bow.

02:06:58.837 --> 02:07:03.133
- That's better. And now...
- No.

02:07:03.592 --> 02:07:05.469
Crucio!

02:07:07.929 --> 02:07:09.639
Crucio!

02:07:10.724 --> 02:07:12.684
Attaboy, Harry.

02:07:12.851 --> 02:07:14.978
Your parents would be proud.

02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:18.690
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

02:07:18.857 --> 02:07:20.400
Expelliar...

02:07:23.445 --> 02:07:25.822
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

02:07:26.031 --> 02:07:27.991
I'm going to destroy you.

02:07:30.202 --> 02:07:35.791
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

02:07:36.416 --> 02:07:38.960
After tonight, if they speak of you...

02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:41.838
...they'll speak only of how you...

02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:43.924
...begged for death.

02:07:44.132 --> 02:07:47.886
And I, being a merciful Lord...

02:07:48.428 --> 02:07:50.055
...obliged.

02:07:50.388 --> 02:07:51.848
Get up!

02:07:56.895 --> 02:07:58.855
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

02:07:59.022 --> 02:08:01.233
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

02:08:01.441 --> 02:08:04.611
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

02:08:18.582 --> 02:08:20.292
Have it your way.

02:08:21.377 --> 02:08:23.754
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

02:08:41.272 --> 02:08:43.941
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

02:08:48.529 --> 02:08:50.239
He's mine!

02:09:23.314 --> 02:09:27.318
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

02:09:27.485 --> 02:09:29.528
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

02:09:29.695 --> 02:09:31.489
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

02:09:32.656 --> 02:09:35.659
Harry, take my body back, will you?

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:38.412
Take my body back to my father.

02:09:39.455 --> 02:09:40.748
Let go.

02:09:41.248 --> 02:09:43.209
Sweetheart, you're ready.

02:09:44.043 --> 02:09:46.670
Let go! Let go!

02:09:52.425 --> 02:09:53.802
Accio!

02:09:59.516 --> 02:10:01.476
No!

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:15.865
He did it!

02:10:17.075 --> 02:10:18.701
Harry!

02:10:21.538 --> 02:10:22.997
Harry!

02:10:24.207 --> 02:10:27.460
No! No! No, don't!

02:10:27.752 --> 02:10:29.629
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

02:10:29.921 --> 02:10:32.465
He's back. He's back.

02:10:32.674 --> 02:10:34.717
Voldemort's back.

02:10:34.884 --> 02:10:37.262
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

02:10:37.429 --> 02:10:39.722
I couldn't leave him, not there.

02:10:39.931 --> 02:10:42.684
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

02:10:42.892 --> 02:10:45.186
He's home. You both are.

02:10:45.395 --> 02:10:48.982
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

02:10:52.068 --> 02:10:55.655
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

02:10:56.030 --> 02:10:57.740
Let me through.

02:10:57.907 --> 02:10:59.367
Let me through!

02:11:01.327 --> 02:11:02.579
Let me through!

02:11:02.746 --> 02:11:04.122
That's my son!

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:06.916
That's my boy!

02:11:09.753 --> 02:11:12.422
It's my boy!

02:11:15.258 --> 02:11:18.845
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

02:11:19.012 --> 02:11:21.931
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.850
No!

02:11:27.936 --> 02:11:30.314
It's all right, I got you.

02:11:30.481 --> 02:11:33.817
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

02:11:37.821 --> 02:11:39.615
No!

02:11:40.741 --> 02:11:42.618
No!

02:12:24.993 --> 02:12:26.703
Are you all right, Potter?

02:12:27.287 --> 02:12:29.164
Does it hurt? That?

02:12:29.373 --> 02:12:31.166
Not so much now.

02:12:32.126 --> 02:12:34.169
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

02:12:37.339 --> 02:12:39.299
The cup was a Portkey.

02:12:42.052 --> 02:12:43.846
Someone had bewitched it.

02:12:44.179 --> 02:12:46.223
What was it like?

02:12:46.598 --> 02:12:48.225
- What was he like?
- Who?

02:12:48.434 --> 02:12:50.144
The Dark Lord.

02:12:52.521 --> 02:12:55.607
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

02:12:56.859 --> 02:12:58.651
I don't know.

02:13:01.529 --> 02:13:04.449
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

02:13:07.410 --> 02:13:09.370
...into one of my nightmares.

02:13:28.139 --> 02:13:29.682
Were there others?

02:13:29.891 --> 02:13:32.101
In the graveyard, were there others?

02:13:36.063 --> 02:13:37.440
I...

02:13:38.191 --> 02:13:42.069
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

02:13:49.577 --> 02:13:52.830
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

02:13:57.251 --> 02:14:00.254
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

02:14:00.463 --> 02:14:02.340
...if I hadn't suggested it?

02:14:05.927 --> 02:14:09.597
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

02:14:09.764 --> 02:14:12.225
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

02:14:13.893 --> 02:14:16.562
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:19.899
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

02:14:20.108 --> 02:14:21.651
...that led him straight to it?

02:14:30.076 --> 02:14:34.037
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

02:14:34.621 --> 02:14:38.291
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

02:14:38.458 --> 02:14:40.585
You won because I made it so, Potter.

02:14:41.253 --> 02:14:44.756
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

02:14:44.923 --> 02:14:46.174
And now the deed is done.

02:14:47.884 --> 02:14:52.180
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

02:15:00.730 --> 02:15:04.234
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

02:15:05.152 --> 02:15:07.612
...that I have once and for all...

02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:12.576
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

02:15:12.784 --> 02:15:13.994
Expelliarmus!

02:15:18.749 --> 02:15:20.000
Severus.

02:15:22.502 --> 02:15:23.962
That's it, take it.

02:15:25.964 --> 02:15:29.384
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

02:15:29.593 --> 02:15:32.262
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

02:15:32.471 --> 02:15:35.557
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

02:15:38.602 --> 02:15:40.145
Harry, away from there!

02:16:01.124 --> 02:16:04.460
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

02:16:05.419 --> 02:16:07.463
That's Moody. But then who's...?

02:16:09.298 --> 02:16:10.382
Polyjuice Potion.

02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:13.803
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

02:16:14.053 --> 02:16:15.930
We'll get you up in a minute.

02:16:50.423 --> 02:16:51.799
Harry!

02:16:55.468 --> 02:16:57.680
Barty Crouch Junior.

02:16:57.930 --> 02:17:00.850
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

02:17:03.227 --> 02:17:04.395
Your arm, Harry.

02:17:08.773 --> 02:17:10.985
You know what this means, don't you?

02:17:11.943 --> 02:17:13.279
He's back.

02:17:14.447 --> 02:17:16.574
Lord Voldemort has returned.

02:17:17.532 --> 02:17:19.826
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

02:17:20.076 --> 02:17:24.623
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

02:17:25.082 --> 02:17:27.543
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

02:17:28.127 --> 02:17:30.963
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

02:17:50.898 --> 02:17:53.567
Today, we acknowledge...

02:17:54.277 --> 02:17:57.030
...a really terrible loss.

02:17:59.156 --> 02:18:01.910
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

02:18:02.076 --> 02:18:04.370
...exceptionally hard-working...

02:18:05.370 --> 02:18:07.665
...infinitely fair-minded...

02:18:08.249 --> 02:18:10.543
...and, most importantly...

02:18:10.834 --> 02:18:15.380
...a fierce, fierce friend.

02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:20.929
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

02:18:23.973 --> 02:18:25.517
You see...

02:18:26.351 --> 02:18:28.394
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

02:18:29.353 --> 02:18:31.314
...by Lord Voldemort!

02:18:33.233 --> 02:18:36.820
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

02:18:37.445 --> 02:18:41.116
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

02:18:43.325 --> 02:18:44.952
Now, the pain...

02:18:45.161 --> 02:18:48.832
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

02:18:48.998 --> 02:18:50.290
...and reminds us...

02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:54.170
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

02:18:54.379 --> 02:18:57.799
...our hearts beat as one.

02:18:58.299 --> 02:19:00.343
In light of recent events...

02:19:00.677 --> 02:19:05.557
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

02:19:06.474 --> 02:19:11.812
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

02:19:12.228 --> 02:19:14.356
You remember that...

02:19:14.982 --> 02:19:17.985
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

02:19:18.568 --> 02:19:21.029
...kind and honest...

02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:26.075
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

02:19:51.351 --> 02:19:53.395
I never liked these curtains.

02:19:53.979 --> 02:19:56.648
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

02:19:56.982 --> 02:19:58.776
By accident, of course.

02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:08.869
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

02:20:12.289 --> 02:20:13.916
Professor...

02:20:14.166 --> 02:20:17.169
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

02:20:17.961 --> 02:20:22.341
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

02:20:23.967 --> 02:20:26.261
Priori Incantatem.

02:20:30.432 --> 02:20:33.143
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

02:20:33.727 --> 02:20:35.521
They reappeared.

02:20:37.022 --> 02:20:40.776
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

02:20:43.362 --> 02:20:45.988
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

02:20:46.447 --> 02:20:51.244
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

02:20:54.664 --> 02:20:56.290
But remember this:

02:20:56.499 --> 02:20:58.376
You have friends here.

02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:02.130
You're not alone.

02:21:22.859 --> 02:21:24.569
Hermione.

02:21:25.027 --> 02:21:26.988
This is for you.

02:21:27.613 --> 02:21:29.824
Write to me. Promise.

02:21:30.908 --> 02:21:32.285
Bye.

02:21:38.541 --> 02:21:40.501
Au revoir, Ron.

02:22:24.419 --> 02:22:26.963
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

02:22:27.130 --> 02:22:28.215
- No.
- No.

02:22:28.423 --> 02:22:32.803
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

02:22:37.224 --> 02:22:40.060
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

02:22:47.359 --> 02:22:48.819
Yes.

02:22:53.573 --> 02:22:56.827
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:59.579
I won't. You know I won't.

02:23:00.872 --> 02:23:04.626
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.

02:36:59.077 --> 02:37:01.120
