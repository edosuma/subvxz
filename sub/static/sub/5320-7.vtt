WEBVTT

00:00.338 --> 00:02.288
Hey, you know, we missed
watching the games

00:02.373 --> 00:04.236
with you last week.
Yeah, we had Ellie's stupid soccer game.

00:04.356 --> 00:05.639
You know what, though?
Next, week, last week.

00:05.724 --> 00:08.453
Oh, my God!
We're done. Oh, peaches.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.247
Hey, where's Pete been?

00:10.367 --> 00:12.826
Oh, he's been, you know,
really busy with his ref stuff.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.245
You got to put the hours in.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.843
Oh, man, he loves
those ref buddies.

00:15.980 --> 00:19.431
Ref buddies? No, they're just...
they're work friends, okay?

00:19.516 --> 00:21.016
Like someone you have lunch
with in your office

00:21.101 --> 00:22.501
instead of eating alone,
that's all.

00:22.519 --> 00:25.153
Well, all I know is, he's AWOL,
Ruxin's in Puerto Rico,

00:25.189 --> 00:27.606
so while the cat's away,
the mice will play.

00:27.691 --> 00:30.609
Don't say that, Andre!
Especially while holding

00:30.694 --> 00:32.494
a thick cucumber.
This?

00:32.529 --> 00:35.747
Stop it!
Wow. Look at this place.

00:35.833 --> 00:38.200
Everywhere you look,
there's a super hot lady.

00:38.252 --> 00:39.868
This it like the new bar,

00:39.920 --> 00:41.253
but you don't have to,
like, go up to somebody

00:41.338 --> 00:42.671
with an opening line.

00:42.706 --> 00:44.456
You just kind of ask a woman
about fruits and vegetables.

00:44.541 --> 00:45.591
I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:45.676 --> 00:46.959
Watch and learn.

00:47.044 --> 00:49.211
So, can I ask your
opinion about something?

00:49.296 --> 00:51.930
Oh, what did I miss?
Not much yet.

00:52.016 --> 00:53.098
This cucumber seems
great 'cause it's,

00:53.183 --> 00:54.549
you know, it's long and skinny.

00:54.602 --> 00:56.101
But then this one--
I don't know--

00:56.186 --> 00:57.469
maybe it's more fulfilling

00:57.554 --> 00:59.354
'cause it's, like,
kind of short and squat.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.857
Which one would satisfy
you-- tall and skinny,

01:01.892 --> 01:03.609
or short and squat?

01:03.694 --> 01:06.061
You are seriously
such a pervert.

01:06.113 --> 01:07.396
Did you get laid?

01:07.481 --> 01:09.931
Eh. She's probably
an eggplant gal.

01:10.051 --> 01:15.119

01:15.239 --> 01:17.239
ANDRE:
<i>See...</i>

01:17.291 --> 01:18.874
Meegan was great, right?

01:18.909 --> 01:21.627
But that sophisticated city
person isn't right for me.

01:21.712 --> 01:24.579
I need someone a little bit more
country, you know, so I joined

01:24.665 --> 01:28.550
FarmCouples.com, and
look at these girls.

01:28.585 --> 01:30.085
So cute, right?

01:30.170 --> 01:32.587
They even have an app, like a
Tinder app, called "Firmer."

01:32.640 --> 01:34.139
I don't think that's the way
it's pronounced.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.424
Plus, you've heard
all those stories

01:35.476 --> 01:36.642
about the farmer's daughter.

01:36.727 --> 01:38.677
Andre, those aren't stories.
They're jokes.

01:38.762 --> 01:41.430
That's like saying, "Have you
heard the story about the guy

01:41.482 --> 01:43.398
who keeps knock-knocking
on peoples' doors?"

01:43.434 --> 01:44.933
I <i> have</i> heard those stories,

01:44.985 --> 01:46.601
and I'm always surprised
by who's there.

01:46.687 --> 01:47.569
"By farmers, for farmers."

01:47.604 --> 01:49.321
Uh, which one are you?

01:49.406 --> 01:51.323
That is a problem, yes.
Yes, what are you gonna do about that?

01:51.408 --> 01:52.691
I got to figure out
how to get a farm.

01:52.776 --> 01:53.992
I have a farm.

01:54.078 --> 01:55.277
Taco, growing marijuana

01:55.329 --> 01:56.445
on your windowsill
is not a farm.

01:56.530 --> 01:57.946
No, that's how it started out.

01:58.032 --> 02:00.365
I was growing my own weed
at the EBDB B&B.

02:00.451 --> 02:02.784
But I had to keep going
to the store to get my munchies,

02:02.836 --> 02:05.037
so I just started
growing my own munchies.

02:05.122 --> 02:07.789
So, the EBDB B&B is a
fully-functioning farm?

02:07.841 --> 02:10.508
Yeah. As you can imagine,
the soil there is quite fertile.

02:10.594 --> 02:11.710
No, no thank you.
Ew.

02:11.795 --> 02:13.035
Yeah, just keep dumping loads...

02:13.047 --> 02:14.680
Okay. It's enough.
No. No, thank you.

02:16.934 --> 02:19.217
(broadcast playing on TV)
I-I can't do this. I cannot!

02:19.303 --> 02:21.019
Do you have to sit
this close to me?!

02:21.105 --> 02:22.270
I'm like Beetlejuice.

02:22.306 --> 02:23.605
Say my name three times,
and I just show up.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.724
No one even said it once, Andre!

02:25.809 --> 02:28.110
Oh! Caught you!
(buzzing)

02:28.145 --> 02:30.228
Whoa! Jesus!
What is that, man?

02:30.314 --> 02:31.834
TACO: Meet the Taco drone.
ANDRE: Taco.

02:31.865 --> 02:33.031
Taco!

02:33.117 --> 02:35.400
No, no, no!
Come on! Just put

02:35.486 --> 02:37.319
some chips in the basket.
KEVIN: Come in here and

02:37.371 --> 02:38.704
get it yourself!

02:38.789 --> 02:40.069
Just put the chips on the drone.

02:40.074 --> 02:41.540
What's wrong with you?

02:41.625 --> 02:43.458
What's wrong with me?!
What's wrong with you?!

02:43.494 --> 02:44.659
JENNY:
No! No, no!

02:44.745 --> 02:46.995
No flying this in our house.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.164
What?!
What? Why do you even have it?

02:49.216 --> 02:51.166
TACO:
It's the newest

02:51.218 --> 02:53.635
exclusive benefit
for EBDB Prime members.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.970
I got to stay competitive.

02:55.005 --> 02:57.756
And your competitors are who?

02:57.841 --> 02:59.674
I mean, who isn't a competitor?

02:59.760 --> 03:02.094
Wall Street, big oil,
little oil.

03:02.179 --> 03:03.595
Little oil?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.063
It's a guy I know.
He siphons gasoline

03:05.149 --> 03:07.065
out of parted cars and sells it
on the side of the road.

03:07.151 --> 03:08.316
Does he have a drone?

03:08.352 --> 03:09.832
Well, right now,
he has a screwdriver,

03:09.853 --> 03:12.437
a hose and a bucket, but a
drone cannot be far behind.

03:12.523 --> 03:14.189
The guy's an innovator.

03:14.274 --> 03:15.741
The best part of
this whole thing--

03:15.826 --> 03:18.910
when EBDB Prime members aren't
using it, I get to use it,

03:18.996 --> 03:21.197
and it helps with tedious tasks
that I never want to do.

03:21.198 --> 03:23.081
Like watch TV with you guys.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.784
Come on, Flying Taco,
let's go chop up some kites.

03:25.869 --> 03:27.202
Taco, is this safe?
Whoa!

03:27.254 --> 03:28.203
Is that safe?

03:28.288 --> 03:31.089
(buzzing, whirring)

03:31.175 --> 03:32.207
I mean, he's gonna
kill someone, right?

03:32.259 --> 03:33.291
How do we know he hasn't?

03:33.377 --> 03:34.376
Hey, guys.
KEVIN: Pete!

03:34.428 --> 03:36.378
Hey! Pete likes beer.

03:36.463 --> 03:38.046
Jenny, can you get me and Pete
a beer, please?

03:38.132 --> 03:39.381
No, you get him a beer.

03:39.433 --> 03:40.549
Uh, no. Yeah,
I was actually just

03:40.634 --> 03:41.850
coming to get my jacket.
I gotta run.

03:41.885 --> 03:43.268
Oh!
Just wanted to say hi.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.103
Okay, where you...
where you heading off to?

03:45.189 --> 03:47.522
Oh, uh, I was gonna go to
a movie with my ref buddy.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.224
That... Cool.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.716
You guys are hanging out when
you're not working. That's cool.

03:51.728 --> 03:52.944
Yeah.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.062
Just like the way we do.
(whispering): Oh, God.

03:54.148 --> 03:55.063
Best friends forever, right?

03:55.115 --> 03:56.398
Get off of me, please.

03:56.450 --> 03:57.566
Yeah.
PETE: Hey, man.

03:57.618 --> 03:59.067
This is, uh, Jenny, it's Andre.

03:59.153 --> 04:00.452
Hey.
Hey. Hey, I'm Kevin.

04:00.537 --> 04:02.237
Hey. I'm Kevin.

04:02.289 --> 04:03.822
Kevin.
Kevin.

04:03.907 --> 04:06.741
Well, Pete
calls me "Kev."

04:06.827 --> 04:08.627
Pete calls me "Kev."

04:08.712 --> 04:10.662
Does he?

04:10.747 --> 04:12.047
Uh, anyway,
we should get, uh, cranking.

04:12.082 --> 04:13.298
Okay. Yeah.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.083
Um, do you... you want
to grab a beer

04:15.169 --> 04:16.468
or something after the movie?

04:16.553 --> 04:18.086
We don't know how
long the movie is.

04:18.172 --> 04:19.588
Yeah, there's, like,
trailers and stuff.

04:19.673 --> 04:22.007
Could be complicated, but, um...
Oh, yeah, no.

04:22.091 --> 04:23.141
We'll catch up soon.
We'll-we'll see... Yeah...

04:23.227 --> 04:24.588
Yeah, no, it's...
it's complicated.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.978
Whoa. Whoa. Miss that. Oh.
Come on.

04:27.064 --> 04:28.513
Okay. (patting)
KEVIN: Yeah.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.348
Ready to do this?
Yeah.

04:30.434 --> 04:31.817
(blow whistles)

04:31.902 --> 04:33.935
Nice to meet you guys.

04:33.987 --> 04:34.986
You, too, Kevin.

04:37.274 --> 04:39.024
Well, looks like
someone's got a type.

04:39.109 --> 04:41.109
His name's Kevin,
your name's Kevin.

04:41.161 --> 04:43.028
He's younger than you,
he's more fun.

04:43.113 --> 04:44.329
He's very pretty.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.448
It's like Pete got his own
trophy Kevin.

04:46.533 --> 04:47.866
There's no trophy Kevin!

04:47.951 --> 04:49.284
Ah, don't worry about it, buddy.

04:49.369 --> 04:50.869
It's you and me forever now.

04:50.954 --> 04:54.172
And when we play dick chicken,
I'm going to let you win.

04:54.258 --> 04:55.790
Andre, just stop. Stop!
What?

04:55.876 --> 04:57.876
Okay, fine. Well, I'm just
here with my bros and my hos.

04:57.961 --> 04:59.094
Ugh! Okay.
Oh, God!

04:59.129 --> 05:00.462
What? My bros and hos!

05:02.799 --> 05:04.850
Thank you so much for waiting.

05:04.935 --> 05:07.936
Room 17 is finally occupied,
so feel free

05:07.971 --> 05:10.722
to let yourselves in
and join the orgy.

05:10.807 --> 05:12.641
Howdy, partner.

05:12.726 --> 05:15.477
Why you talking
with an Asian accent?

05:15.562 --> 05:17.863
It's not Asian. I'm a cowboy.
Supposed to be a farmer.

05:17.948 --> 05:19.614
What's the difference?
There's cows on farms.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.483
No, not on this farm.

05:21.535 --> 05:23.485
There's a pony somewhere,
but I keep losing him.

05:23.537 --> 05:24.953
Think he's in the
bedroom upstairs.

05:24.988 --> 05:27.489
Well, why don't we wrestle up
some of them varmints

05:27.541 --> 05:29.491
and then check out that firm?

05:29.543 --> 05:31.663
Okay, I'll show you, but
then you're gonna have to go,

05:31.745 --> 05:33.628
'cause you're gonna
creep everyone out.

05:33.664 --> 05:36.498
This is your farm?
Yup.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.166
Pretty cool, huh?

05:38.218 --> 05:40.218
It's a little small.

05:40.304 --> 05:42.465
Yeah, I've been experimenting
with cross-breeding crops

05:42.506 --> 05:43.838
and trying to
create my own strain

05:43.891 --> 05:46.725
of EBDB B&B F&V THC.

05:46.810 --> 05:48.343
Wait, wait. F&V?

05:48.428 --> 05:49.844
Fruit and vegetable.

05:49.897 --> 05:51.429
Trying to create a
corn-scented weed.

05:51.515 --> 05:53.899
I'm also trying to grow
an entire salad's worth

05:53.984 --> 05:55.400
of vegetables on a single cob,

05:55.485 --> 05:57.068
a "cob salad," if you will.

05:57.154 --> 05:58.486
Great, great.

05:58.522 --> 06:00.238
Well, anyway, you got that.

06:00.324 --> 06:02.023
I just need to make
a couple quick pictures

06:02.109 --> 06:03.775
for FarmCouples.com...
No, no, no, no, no.

06:03.860 --> 06:05.277
I'm putting you to
work, young man.

06:05.362 --> 06:06.912
I need you to till the soil,

06:06.997 --> 06:08.163
pull the weeds,

06:08.198 --> 06:09.664
and if I catch you
smoking any of my corn,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.583
you're in big trouble!

06:11.668 --> 06:14.592
I'm gonna go have sex
with someone. Wait up!

06:16.382 --> 06:17.965
How'd it go?
We won.

06:18.050 --> 06:19.512
Oh, that's great, honey.

06:19.632 --> 06:20.964
Awesome! Good job!
Thanks.

06:21.017 --> 06:23.350
You earned yourself a Popsicle.
Go get it.

06:23.436 --> 06:25.667
Awesome.
Nice! Chow down.

06:25.787 --> 06:27.521
They won.
We lost.

06:27.606 --> 06:30.724
- Why? - Because if they win one more
game, they go to the play-offs.

06:30.810 --> 06:33.514
<i>Play-offs?!</i> Play-offs?

06:33.634 --> 06:36.363
Yes. Jim Mora play-offs
in Decatur.

06:36.449 --> 06:39.116
Decatur?!
That means four more Sundays

06:39.151 --> 06:43.167
of carpooling back and forth
to Decatur and no football.

06:43.287 --> 06:45.654
Sounds like hell.
It's a nightmare scenario.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.906
Oh. Well, I just stopped by
to use the bathroom,

06:47.992 --> 06:49.992
freshen up, I'm on my way
out the door.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.828
Ah, you got a nice tapas date
with your best buddy Andre?

06:52.913 --> 06:53.912
No.
No?

06:53.998 --> 06:55.213
I'm actually
meeting up with Pete.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.499
Oh, Trophy Kevin have
a detention after school?

06:57.584 --> 07:01.003
Very funny. If Andre calls, do
not tell him where I am, please.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.338
That's a real love triangle.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.557
♪ ♪

07:09.480 --> 07:11.263
(whistle blows)
PETE: Foul.

07:11.315 --> 07:13.181
Whoa-hoa-hoa,
good call! Whoo!

07:13.267 --> 07:14.933
Which one is yours?

07:14.985 --> 07:16.101
Right there.

07:16.153 --> 07:17.519
The tall kid by the ref?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.604
No. Just the ref.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.690
(buzzer sounds)
All right.

07:20.691 --> 07:21.773
(blows whistle)

07:21.859 --> 07:23.191
Game over!
Yeah-heah!

07:23.277 --> 07:24.359
PETE:
Everybody shake hands,

07:24.445 --> 07:25.744
pretend like
you like each other.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.412
It's like we've been
doing this for years together.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.613
I know. Awesome, man.

07:28.666 --> 07:29.748
On point.
That's my Kevin!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.366
Crazy.
Hey, Pete!

07:31.452 --> 07:33.669
What's up? Sweet no-call
at the end of the game.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.620
Really good discipline.
Hey, Kevin.

07:35.673 --> 07:36.621
Kevin.
Kev.

07:36.674 --> 07:37.422
Kev.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.623
Uh, what's going on?

07:38.709 --> 07:39.958
What are you doing here?

07:40.010 --> 07:41.510
Oh. I was in the neighborhood,

07:41.595 --> 07:43.712
and I just figured we'd grab
a drink after the game.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.714
An adult alcoholic beverage.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.120
Uh, yeah, I mean,
it sounds great.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.800
Uh, we have the court
for another hour.

07:48.852 --> 07:50.102
We were gonna play.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.770
Ref pickup game.
Yeah. Oh.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.772
Great.
No, I'll play. I'm in.

07:53.807 --> 07:54.940
Let's do it.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.441
You gonna play in that?
Sure.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.726
All right.
Let's do it.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.394
Let's do this.
Let's do it. Here we go.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.479
Oh... Ow.

08:00.531 --> 08:03.565
Taco, this one
just kind of fell out.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.317
Put it back in!

08:05.369 --> 08:08.653
And while you're at it,
try to grow some opium.

08:08.706 --> 08:10.622
W-With <i> this?</i>

08:10.657 --> 08:11.823
Uh-huh.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.125
It's a poppy seed bagel.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.243
Yeah. You got a lot
of bagel scraping to do.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.895
I want you working till sundown.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.080
See ya.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.581
See how I'm doing on Farmer.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.300
(mooing sound effect)
Ooh. I got a love sprout.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.052
"Want to meet up?"

08:24.138 --> 08:26.221
Yes, I do.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.006
(buzzing, whirring)
All right.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.342
TACO (over radio): Where do you think
<i>you're</i> going?

08:30.394 --> 08:32.894
I-I got a date-- you know,
so I have to go home and...

08:32.980 --> 08:35.063
shower and put on my,
uh, fancy overalls.

08:35.149 --> 08:36.681
Uh-uh. Did you plant
the opium yet?

08:36.734 --> 08:38.066
Look, I can't grow opium

08:38.152 --> 08:40.184
from a poppy seed bagel, okay?
I'll be back later.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.653
No, no, no, no.
You're staying right here.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.520
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay!

08:42.606 --> 08:43.655
There's still sowing to be done.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.856
Or maybe it's reaping.
Fine.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.192
I can never tell.
Selfie with a drone?

08:47.244 --> 08:48.421
No. Selfies are lame.

08:48.541 --> 08:49.877
Oh, gee-- all right, all right,
all right! All right!

08:49.997 --> 08:52.030
All right, I'm gonna go
have drone sex. Later.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.366
(whistle blows)

08:54.451 --> 08:55.751
All right, game on.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.369
We really doing a tip-off
for a pickup game?

08:57.421 --> 08:58.954
Yeah, refs like to do it
by the book.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.123
(whistle blows) Wait. Wait.
I don't know who's...

09:01.208 --> 09:03.708
- Right. - Are you up? Wait a minute. Hold
on. I don't know who I have.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.955
All right? Are you on my team?
Hold on. Get it. Get it.

09:07.598 --> 09:10.549
(whistle blows)
Foul. Handshake. Suit.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.915
Who had a foul?
Take it. You'll get used to it. It's okay.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.053
Not on my watch.

09:15.105 --> 09:16.354
Oh. Oh, God.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.689
PETE:
Oh, yeah!

09:17.724 --> 09:19.274
Kev!

09:19.359 --> 09:20.642
Oh, that tasted good.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.561
What tasted good?
What was good about that?

09:22.646 --> 09:24.646
(whistle blows)
You should probably do shirts and skins,

09:24.731 --> 09:26.615
obviously, because...
(whistle blowing)

09:26.700 --> 09:28.900
What? Oh.
Lane violation, man. Stay on the line.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.240
KEVIN: Stripes!
Stripes! Pete!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.409
Pete, Pete.
I'm not on your team, man.

09:37.461 --> 09:38.577
(whistle blowing)
Go!

09:38.662 --> 09:40.128
What could that possibly be for?

09:40.214 --> 09:41.413
Shot clock violation.

09:41.465 --> 09:43.131
Oh, no way.

09:43.217 --> 09:44.416
Are you on my team?!

09:44.501 --> 09:45.500
Come on, this way.
Oh!

09:45.586 --> 09:46.918
(whistle blows)
What? Oh...!

09:47.004 --> 09:48.420
Hand check.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.088
Bullshit! You know what?

09:50.174 --> 09:51.256
You've been riding me this whole ga--
(whistle blows)

09:51.308 --> 09:52.757
Come on, man, you can't do that.

09:52.810 --> 09:54.092
Are you kidding me? You didn't
even see what I said to him.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.260
(whistle blowing)
I told him it was a great call.

09:55.312 --> 09:56.712
Wait, I thought
you were on my team.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.314
Who blew it?

09:59.399 --> 10:01.933
Curly hair, did you blow it?
Somebody blew that whistle!

10:02.019 --> 10:03.602
Everyone's got...
(whistles blowing)

10:03.654 --> 10:04.820
This is...Everyone has a whistle!
PETE: Okay, okay, Kev...

10:04.905 --> 10:05.937
What? I want a whistle!

10:05.989 --> 10:07.322
Everyone has a whistle.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.691
I want a (bleep) whistle.
This is a pickup game.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.327
ANDRE: You know, again, I'm so
sorry about the other night.

10:12.412 --> 10:16.248
I just got caught in some farm stuff.
Farm stuff?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.283
Yeah, you know, when Mother
Nature wants your hands

10:18.335 --> 10:20.252
inside of her,
you can't exactly say no.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.837
Right?
(laughs) Right, right.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.705
Well, what does she give you?
What do you grow on your farm?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.124
All-all the cash crops.

10:26.176 --> 10:28.877
"Tobacky," uh, indigo...

10:28.962 --> 10:31.046
Indigo?
And it's all heirloom now.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.850
Heirloom... cucumbers,
heirloom radishes.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.968
Heirloom radishes?

10:37.054 --> 10:38.637
I mean, everything's heirloom.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.556
It's kind of like the perfect
mix of farming and antiquing.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.608
(laughs)
So, what's your secret?

10:43.644 --> 10:45.610
Well, I only use my hands.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.028
You have no machines
on your farm?

10:47.114 --> 10:49.814
My pappy used to say, uh,
"Farmin's a real hand job.

10:49.867 --> 10:52.317
"You got to...
you got to stroke the land,

10:52.402 --> 10:55.153
and plant your seed
and watch it sprout."

10:55.239 --> 10:56.821
You know,
and shuck yourself to sleep.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.459
You know, I would love to see
this farm of yours, Andre.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.378
Well, is that a date?

11:03.463 --> 11:05.497
I think it is a date, yeah.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.332
Okay, well, my farm or yours?

11:07.384 --> 11:09.334
Yours!

11:09.386 --> 11:12.554
I would love to see this
heirloom hand-job farm.

11:14.391 --> 11:16.391
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.592
Yee-haw.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.311
JENNY:
<i>And she actually</i>

11:19.346 --> 11:21.846
thinks <i> you</i> are a farmer?

11:21.899 --> 11:24.399
Lest you forget, Jenny--
I'm a boyfriend chameleon.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.434
Whatever my girlfriend is, I am.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.354
The only problem is,
I can't produce a farm.

11:29.406 --> 11:31.156
Just take her to Taco's.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.192
Yeah. Come on down
to the EBDB B&B Farm,

11:34.244 --> 11:36.578
where you can catch hay fever
or an STD.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.579
What's up, guys?

11:37.664 --> 11:38.830
Hello.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.115
Haven't seen you in a while.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.166
ANDRE:
But <i> we</i> have been

11:41.201 --> 11:43.118
doing just fine.
Get off me.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.703
Well, you won't have
to miss me this weekend,

11:44.755 --> 11:47.372
because I'm actually gonna be
reffing Ellie's soccer game.

11:47.424 --> 11:49.090
Really!
Really? Really?

11:49.176 --> 11:50.342
Why do you care?
I don't know.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.793
I'm just trying
to stay in the mix.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.211
Really?

11:53.263 --> 11:54.763
This team she's playing--
are they any good?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.298
Well, they actually
lead the league

11:56.383 --> 11:57.682
in goals scored...
Great.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.217
...on themselves.
They are

11:59.303 --> 12:01.019
the worst soccer team
I have ever seen.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.971
Actually, Kev and I were just
talking about it.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.606
It was so funny.
We were?

12:04.691 --> 12:06.057
Oh, no, Ref Kev.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.442
Yeah. Um...
Oh. Oh.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.727
I'm gonna grab a beer.

12:08.779 --> 12:10.061
Might wet my whistle.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.730
Little inside ref joke.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.698
ANDRE:
Wow.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.568
Looks like Trophy Kevin's taking
your sport, Starter Kevin.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.569
(laughs)

12:17.654 --> 12:19.120
It's not funny!

12:19.206 --> 12:21.156
How would you feel if I started
hanging out with a trophy Jenny?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.791
I <i> am</i> Trophy Jenny.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.909
Oh.
I'm gonna get a beer.

12:24.962 --> 12:26.578
That joke really backfired.

12:26.630 --> 12:28.630
Want to talk about it?
No.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.249
Yeah.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.218
All right.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.470
So that team Ellie's playing
is really bad, huh?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.138
Yeah, they're terrible.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.090
It's gonna be a cakewalk for
you guys. Don't worry about it.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.142
What if certain circumstances
were to arise

12:41.228 --> 12:43.845
that made a win easy
for the other team?

12:43.930 --> 12:47.849
Are you insinuating that
I should throw the game

12:47.934 --> 12:49.768
so that your
daughter's team loses?

12:49.820 --> 12:53.772
Come on, it is four more weeks
of soccer, Pete, in Decatur!

12:53.857 --> 12:56.274
That is four more perfectly good
football Sundays ruined.

12:56.326 --> 12:58.326
For what?

12:58.412 --> 13:00.278
Sportsmanship,
the art of winning.

13:00.330 --> 13:02.113
Something a McAsterisk
should probably learn.

13:02.165 --> 13:03.615
I am shocked.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.000
I am a man of integrity, Jenny!

13:05.085 --> 13:07.035
No, you're not!
I am when it comes to this.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.954
Oh, 12-year-old girls' soccer--
that's your line in the sand?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.623
I took an oath when
I became a referee.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.124
You did not.
You filled out a form,

13:13.210 --> 13:15.260
you went to Foot Locker
and bought a striped shirt.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.678
It was a three-pack,

13:16.763 --> 13:18.463
and these cotton-poly blends
mean something to me.

13:18.515 --> 13:20.131
And I will not be sullied
by your dirty plan.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.800
Soccer is the dirtiest sport
in the world.

13:21.852 --> 13:23.635
Everyone in soccer is dirty!
Come on!

13:23.720 --> 13:26.638
And now, I am recusing myself
as referee of Ellie's game.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.473
Oh, my God.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.475
And you can keep
your blood beer.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.062
Actually, it's not the
delicious beer's fault.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.980
You have no morals.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.827
Goddamn it, Pete! Aah!
(grunting)

13:40.365 --> 13:42.482
Okay, come on! Come on, people!
Let's go! Let's move it!

13:42.534 --> 13:46.241
Remember, we're making a farm.
Great. I love the wheelbarrow.

13:46.361 --> 13:47.660
Very broken, very rustic.

13:47.695 --> 13:49.528
Where do you want
these vintage milk bottles?

13:49.581 --> 13:51.939
Right here, but they need
to be full of expressed milk.

13:52.170 --> 13:54.337
Well, then, you should probably
get a cow.

13:54.389 --> 13:56.756
If I had a cow,
I would show her a cow, okay?

13:56.842 --> 13:57.891
That's where you guys come in.

13:57.976 --> 13:59.509
We're-we're event planners.

13:59.594 --> 14:00.977
You could do a
petting zoo, right?

14:01.012 --> 14:02.645
Just get me a cow!
How hard is that?

14:02.681 --> 14:06.015
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wh-What is that?

14:06.068 --> 14:06.850
Hold on.
It's for your kid's birthday.

14:06.935 --> 14:08.135
He's absolutely gonna love it.

14:08.153 --> 14:09.519
How many times do I have
to tell you?

14:09.571 --> 14:10.770
It's not a birthday.

14:10.856 --> 14:13.356
This is a farm, ranch thing.

14:13.408 --> 14:15.358
The other guy said it was a plantation.
Taco!

14:15.444 --> 14:17.861
Not a plantation, okay?

14:17.913 --> 14:20.196
All right, take the
sign and the cake.

14:20.248 --> 14:22.115
And I thought we agreed
on a goat!

14:22.200 --> 14:23.416
No.
No goat.

14:23.502 --> 14:25.535
Well, you'll be hearing
from me on Yelp!

14:25.620 --> 14:28.705
Taco, what is that?
It's a condom clothesline.

14:28.757 --> 14:30.123
It's disgusting.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.041
No, it's folksy.
Take it down.

14:32.094 --> 14:34.427
I can't take it down.
The condoms are still wet.

14:34.513 --> 14:36.296
You ever try
to put on a wet condom?

14:36.381 --> 14:38.765
It's like peeling off a wet
bathing suit, but in reverse.

14:38.850 --> 14:40.550
Okay, disgusting.
Please take away

14:40.602 --> 14:42.360
that EBDB sign, too.
JoBeth

14:42.395 --> 14:44.195
needs to think
this is a real farm.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.030
What do you want me to do
with the scarecrow?

14:47.234 --> 14:48.900
What the hell?! Taco!

14:48.985 --> 14:50.735
(whispering): I don't need
an erotic scarecrow.

14:50.821 --> 14:53.905
Erotic? This is the least
erotic scarecrow I have.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.961
♪ Drunk flying a drone. ♪

15:00.046 --> 15:01.162
Taco, have you seen Jenny?

15:01.248 --> 15:02.580
Yeah, she left
a little while ago.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.249
She left without me? Really?

15:04.301 --> 15:06.301
Yeah, I'm surprised it took her
this long to leave you, too.

15:06.386 --> 15:08.303
(sighs) I gotta get
to Ellie's soccer game.

15:08.388 --> 15:09.838
Well, I'm almost there already.

15:09.923 --> 15:11.756
Check it out.
What are you talking about?

15:11.808 --> 15:14.142
Yeah.
Oh, shit, look at this!

15:14.227 --> 15:16.761
Wait. Taco, don't you have to
have a proper line of sight

15:16.847 --> 15:18.646
to be able to fly
this thing safely?

15:18.732 --> 15:20.315
Oh, it didn't come
with a line of sight.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.767
No...
All right, I'm gonna let it hover for a bit

15:22.853 --> 15:24.068
until the game starts.

15:24.104 --> 15:25.544
You want anything
out of your fridge?

15:25.572 --> 15:27.105
No, thank you.
All right.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.990
Oh, there's Pete.

15:29.075 --> 15:30.775
Oh, and him.

15:30.861 --> 15:33.945
What are they saying
to each other?

15:33.997 --> 15:35.446
So, in the future...
PETE: Yeah.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.615
hammys before quads.
PETE: Right, I like it.

15:37.701 --> 15:39.250
I like it, Special K.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.336
"Special K?"

15:41.421 --> 15:43.254
He's never called me
"Special K."

15:43.290 --> 15:45.423
All right, I got to take care
of something before the game,

15:45.458 --> 15:46.958
but, uh stay out here.
Yeah, bro.

15:47.043 --> 15:48.323
Here it comes, here it comes.
Hi.

15:48.378 --> 15:50.345
Uh-oh.
(whistle blowing)

15:50.430 --> 15:53.047
What is this little prick up to?

15:57.888 --> 16:01.890
Yeah, so, you know, everything
here is, uh, all natural.

16:01.975 --> 16:03.775
You know, got our "tomaters."

16:03.810 --> 16:05.476
Tomaters, huh?
Tomaters, yeah.

16:05.562 --> 16:06.811
Got some, uh, "kairn."

16:06.863 --> 16:08.313
(laughs)
You know.

16:08.365 --> 16:09.647
Please say that again.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.149
Yeah, "kairn," you know.

16:11.201 --> 16:12.317
Corn?

16:12.402 --> 16:13.818
Yeah, it's my-my
farmer accent.

16:13.904 --> 16:15.286
It's intense.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.488
May I interest you in
some, uh, "so-dee" pop?

16:17.541 --> 16:20.158
Made right here on
the, uh... on the firm.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.826
So you make soda here?

16:21.912 --> 16:25.163
Yeah, just get the water
down from the crick and, uh,

16:25.215 --> 16:27.131
put the cocoa...
oh, goddamn!

16:27.167 --> 16:29.918
S-Sorry. There was a...
Ugh! It was an ant.

16:30.003 --> 16:32.086
Okay, you know what? I'm just
gonna be honest with you, Andre.

16:32.172 --> 16:33.304
Sure.

16:33.340 --> 16:36.057
This farm doesn't feel... real.

16:36.142 --> 16:37.675
Of course... of
course it's real.

16:37.761 --> 16:40.011
It's just, um...
it's more of a...

16:40.096 --> 16:41.679
like a pop-up farm.

16:41.731 --> 16:43.264
Okay.

16:43.350 --> 16:46.184
No farmer has hands
this soft and smooth.

16:46.269 --> 16:47.485
It's genetics.
I mean...

16:47.520 --> 16:49.520
With manicured nails?

16:49.606 --> 16:52.407
Luxury item for a
hard-working man.

16:52.492 --> 16:54.212
Why don't you shoot straight
with me, Andre?

16:54.277 --> 16:56.110
I'm not a farmer.

16:56.196 --> 16:58.162
I'm actually a plastic surgeon.

16:58.198 --> 17:00.281
I only pretend to
be a farmer because

17:00.367 --> 17:02.033
I never thought
you would like a--

17:02.118 --> 17:03.868
I don't know--
a guy like me.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.037
You know, some sort
of big-city big shot.

17:06.122 --> 17:08.673
(laughing): I'm sorry.
You're a plastic surgeon?

17:08.708 --> 17:11.259
Yeah, well, actually, the number
one plastic surgeon in Chicago,

17:11.344 --> 17:12.710
according to
<i>Chi-Town Magazine.</i>

17:12.796 --> 17:14.628
You know, I was only on
FarmCouples.com

17:14.714 --> 17:16.881
because I-I didn't think
I could meet a guy like you.

17:16.967 --> 17:18.383
Really?

17:18.435 --> 17:20.018
Yeah. Really.

17:20.053 --> 17:21.853
I mean, where I come from,

17:21.887 --> 17:24.388
even horse doctors
pull a lot of tails.

17:24.441 --> 17:25.857
Oh...
Not-not literally, of course,

17:25.892 --> 17:27.692
'cause you'd get, like a hoof in the mouth.
Yeah.

17:27.727 --> 17:29.477
Just figuratively. They're just
sleeping around like crazy.

17:29.562 --> 17:31.112
I don't want a guy like that.

17:31.197 --> 17:33.398
I want a... guy like you.

17:33.483 --> 17:35.450
So, wait. You're not mad?

17:35.535 --> 17:37.952
Oh, well, no,
this is... this is weird,

17:38.038 --> 17:39.821
but it's also...

17:39.906 --> 17:41.739
I don't know.
It's kind of sweet.

17:41.825 --> 17:45.376
Well, if you'd like,
I can continue the tour.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.327
Oh!
Yeah.

17:46.413 --> 17:47.578
Well, there's more to this

17:47.664 --> 17:48.963
mini-farm!
Oh, yes indeed.

17:49.049 --> 17:50.465
Oh, come with me.
Okay.

17:50.550 --> 17:54.002
Um, I hope you like
children's birthday cake.

17:58.591 --> 18:00.758
I got eyes on you!

18:00.810 --> 18:02.760
He's taking money.

18:02.846 --> 18:04.929
Look, I know I said $50,
but it's gotta be $100.

18:04.981 --> 18:06.597
And it's not gonna be
an easy game to throw.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.650
(gasps)
Trophy Kevin is dirty!

18:08.735 --> 18:10.018
JENNY:
You're a real scumbag.

18:10.103 --> 18:11.019
Coming from the lady who's
paying me

18:11.104 --> 18:12.103
to toss her daughter's game.

18:12.155 --> 18:13.521
Well, you know what?

18:13.606 --> 18:14.822
$90 is all I have.

18:14.908 --> 18:16.407
All right, consider that
a first-time discount.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.661
What kind of low-life deals
with this son of a bitch?

18:19.746 --> 18:21.446
(buzzing, whirring)

18:22.832 --> 18:25.700
Nice doing business with
you, Mother of the Year.

18:25.785 --> 18:27.285
(gasps)
Jenny!

18:27.337 --> 18:29.170
Sucker. I've still got my money.

18:29.255 --> 18:30.505
Jenny, what are you doing?!

18:30.590 --> 18:32.252
Well, Kevin...!
What are you doing?!

18:32.372 --> 18:34.492
I could ask you the same
question. What are <i> you</i> doing?

18:34.711 --> 18:35.758
All right, listen up.

18:35.997 --> 18:37.231
Trophy Kevin is dirty,

18:37.298 --> 18:38.637
and I'm gonna tell Pete
right now.

18:38.757 --> 18:41.603
No! No! No, Kevin,
you cannot tell Peter!

18:41.730 --> 18:44.532
You cannot! Okay, I cannot do
four more weeks of soccer!

18:44.600 --> 18:47.168
Soccer?! Talking about soccer?!

18:47.236 --> 18:49.170
I'm sorry, Jenny. I have to tell him.
No!

18:49.238 --> 18:50.438
Try and stop me!

18:50.505 --> 18:51.706
All right, Kevin, no!
You get back here!

18:51.773 --> 18:52.874
Get back here, Kevin!

18:52.941 --> 18:55.109
Goddamn, Kevin, get back here!

18:55.177 --> 18:56.477
(whistle blowing)

18:58.247 --> 19:00.047
Taco, how do I work this thing?

19:00.115 --> 19:04.051
(buzzing, whirring)

19:04.119 --> 19:05.453
...what this son
of a bitch is up to.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.157
No, no, no, you cancelled
your EBDB Prime subscription.

19:08.225 --> 19:10.793
(whirring)

19:10.861 --> 19:12.862
What the hell?!

19:12.930 --> 19:14.764
Taco! Taco!
You cancelled your subscription!

19:14.832 --> 19:17.033
(buzzing, whirring)

19:19.103 --> 19:20.203
Give it! Come on!
Give it to me!

19:20.270 --> 19:24.273
(whirring, girls screaming)

19:24.341 --> 19:27.377
(people screaming)

19:27.444 --> 19:29.011
Come on! It's mine!
Give it. Give it back!

19:29.079 --> 19:30.947
(screaming)

19:31.014 --> 19:32.515
Ellie!

19:32.583 --> 19:34.016
Pete needs me!

19:34.084 --> 19:35.964
(everyone screaming,
drone whirring and buzzing)

19:38.155 --> 19:39.322
Come on! Stop!
I need to use it!

19:39.390 --> 19:41.557
(screaming continues)

19:41.625 --> 19:43.025
Hey!
You're gonna get it...

19:43.093 --> 19:44.193
(girls screaming)

19:45.662 --> 19:46.629
Give it back!

19:46.697 --> 19:48.598
Get the hell off my field!

19:48.665 --> 19:49.705
Give it! Give it! Give it!

19:49.733 --> 19:50.933
(buzzing, whirring)

19:51.001 --> 19:51.934
Ow!

19:52.002 --> 19:52.969
No!

19:53.036 --> 19:54.203
God!
Oh.

19:54.271 --> 19:56.205
Oh, man.

19:56.273 --> 19:58.307
I don't know why
you're so jealous of this guy.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.909
You still have all your fingers.

19:59.977 --> 20:01.811
Eesh.

20:01.879 --> 20:03.713
(gasping anxiously)

20:03.781 --> 20:05.061
TROPHY KEVIN:
I thought I had it.

20:05.082 --> 20:07.383
I thought I had it.

20:07.451 --> 20:08.618
I hope you feel better.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.953
I want my money back.

20:11.021 --> 20:12.955
Guys, what a heartbreaker.

20:13.023 --> 20:14.924
I mean, we don't have a ref.

20:14.992 --> 20:16.692
Looks like we're gonna have
to forfeit.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.094
I think
yellow team is just gonna

20:18.162 --> 20:20.363
chalk this one up as a loss.

20:20.431 --> 20:21.431
GIRLS:
Aw!

20:21.498 --> 20:22.665
JENNY:
I know!

20:22.733 --> 20:23.466
Really?

20:23.534 --> 20:24.734
We can't finish the game.

20:24.802 --> 20:26.068
We don't have a ref.

20:26.136 --> 20:28.805
Actually...
we do have a ref.

20:28.872 --> 20:30.273
(girls cheering)

20:30.340 --> 20:32.141
Game on, girls!

20:32.209 --> 20:33.476
(blows whistle)
Follow me!

20:33.544 --> 20:34.477
(girls screaming)

20:34.545 --> 20:37.636
Goddamn you, Pete!

20:38.551 --> 20:41.320
(drone buzzing, whirring)

20:44.148 --> 20:47.016
TACO: Mm. Yeah, yeah,
that's the stuff.

20:47.084 --> 20:48.151
Oh! Ew!
Taco! What are you doing?

20:48.219 --> 20:49.485
This'll be great

20:49.553 --> 20:51.387
for the Web site, Andre.
Let me get the pony.

20:51.455 --> 20:53.256
You big city folk are freaks.

20:53.324 --> 20:54.591
No. JoBeth, come back.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.226
TACO:
What's her deal? She single?

20:56.293 --> 20:57.460
Goddamn it, Taco!

20:57.528 --> 21:00.665
Andre, no! Oh, shit!
