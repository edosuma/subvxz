- UH...

05:52.486 --> 05:58.559
AT FIRST, I JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS BEING WEIRD.

06:02.963 --> 06:08.469
- MEGHAN, DID HE RAPE YOU?

06:08.502 --> 06:11.439
- YES.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.942
- CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT YOUR ATTACKER?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.678
ANY KIND OF PHYSICALITY?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.481
- IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.850
HE WAS WEARING A GOAT MASK.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.719
- DO YOU KNOW HIS RACE?
WAS HE YOUNG, WAS HE OLD?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.988
- HE WAS WHITE.

06:28.021 --> 06:33.694
UM, SMELLED LIKE HE SMOKED.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.029
- DID HE HOLD YOUR WRISTS?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.998
- NO, THAT WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

06:38.031 --> 06:43.537
UM, HE WAS WEARING
A HAWK MASK.

ARE COVERED.

COMPLETELY COVERED.

ALL YOUR BOX OFFICE RECEIPTS

07:03.557 --> 07:05.593
AND CREDIT CARD SLIPS.

- EVE, DO YOU MIND?

07:07.895 --> 07:11.599

NO ONE
ON THE SEX OFFENDERS LIST.

WHO WAS IN THE ROOM

07:53.006 --> 07:54.207
WHEN IT HAPPENED?

07:54.241 --> 07:55.576
- NONE THAT KNOW IT HAPPENED.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.978
IT WAS DARK.
THEY'D ALL HAD A FEW.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.747
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS PART
OF THE SHOW.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.829
SHE'S PRETTY SHAKEN UP.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.497

WHAT, SHE'S AN ACTRESS,
SHE'S ON STAGE,

08:38.919 --> 08:40.654
SHE DRESSED PROVOCATIVELY,

08:40.688 --> 08:41.989
THAT MEANS SHE'S
AUTOMATICALLY LYING?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.624
- NO, THEY DON'T THINK THAT.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.158
- WELL, SOMETHING
WAS GOING ON.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.862
I ALSO KNOW
YOU HEARD IT TOO.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.864
I KEEP WANTING TO THINK
THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED--

08:50.898 --> 08:51.932
- THEY HAVE CHANGED.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.801
COMPARED TO THE WAY
IT USED TO BE,

08:53.834 --> 08:56.269
THEY'VE CHANGED.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.912
- I TOLD YOU ALREADY.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.982
NO ONE I HAVE EVER KNOWN
WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

09:09.016 --> 09:12.152
- SO WHAT ABOUT SOMEBODY
THAT KNOWS YOU?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.187
A FAN?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.156
- LOOK, MEGHAN,
FROM WHAT YOU TELL US,

09:16.189 --> 09:18.291
IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE KNEW THE PLAY.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.761
HE TIMED HIS MOVE.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.764
- THERE ARE GUYS
WHO WAIT OUTSIDE THE STAGE DOOR

09:23.797 --> 09:26.033
FOR AN AUTOGRAPH.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.969
A COUPLE OF THEM I THINK
I'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONCE.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.271
- DO YOU KNOW
ANY OF THEIR NAMES?

09:31.304 --> 09:32.906
- NO.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.875
I JUST SMILE AT THEM.

09:38.378 --> 09:42.783
- OH, I'M SORRY.
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.718
IT'S MY ROOMMATE.

09:44.752 --> 09:49.022
WE MOVED HERE TOGETHER
TO BE ACTRESSES.

09:49.056 --> 09:53.293
HEY, THEY THINK
IT WAS SOMEONE STALKING ME.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.864
- YOU MEAN, ONE OF
YOUR STAGE DOOR JOHNNIES?

09:56.897 --> 10:00.000
- OH, THANKS.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.770

YOU KNOW, LEFT YOU MESSAGES?

10:02.803 --> 10:06.006
TRIED TO SEE YOU OUTSIDE
THE THEATER?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.341
- EVERY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
DURING PREVIEWS,

10:08.375 --> 10:11.144
SOMEONE LEFT RED ROSES.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.380
NO CARD.

10:13.413 --> 10:19.186
I JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE
BEING SWEET.

10:21.789 --> 10:25.025
- THE LAST MULTIPLE
TICKET BUYER--ESTELLE ROBERTS.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.660
- YOU THINK A WOMAN DID THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.730
SHE BOUGHT TICKETS FOUR NIGHTS
A WEEK DURING PREVIEWS.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.432
- PROBABLY JUST
SOME ACTOR'S MOTHER.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.169
- DANTE WHO?
- DANTE'S INFERNO.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.873
A PLAY CALLED NINE CIRCLES.
NINE CIRCLES OF HELL.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.209
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.677
I LIVE IN HELL.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.178
I DON'T NEED
TO SEE A PLAY ABOUT IT.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.914
- A DINER'S CARD
IN YOUR NAME

10:46.947 --> 10:50.183
WAS USED TO PURCHASE SINGLE
TICKETS ON 12 DIFFERENT NIGHTS.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.351
- WELL, IT WASN'T ME.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.286
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A DINER'S CARD.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.023
- WELL, THIS ADDRESS MATCHES
ONE ON FILE AT THE COMPANY.

10:56.056 --> 11:00.327
THE ACCOUNT'S BEEN OPEN
TWO YEARS, PAID ON TIME.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.030
- ANYBODY ELSE LIVE
IN THE HOUSE, MRS. ROBERTS?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.798
- MY SON JASON.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.433
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY CREDIT CARDS EITHER.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.268
- MAYBE WE COULD ASK HIM.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.904
- HE'S NOT HOME.
- IS THIS JASON'S ROOM?

11:10.938 --> 11:15.909
- YES, BUT HE DOESN'T LIKE
STRANGERS LOOKING AT HIS THINGS.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.018
- YEAH, I CAN SEE WHY.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.787
- HE HASN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.322
HE TAKES A LOT OF PICTURES
OF HIS GIRLFRIEND.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.124
- BENSON AND AMARO.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.761
THIS IS FROM TODAY.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.063
HE'S GOT MEGHAN'S APARTMENT
BUGGED.

11:36.096 --> 11:40.768
- YOUR SON--
WHERE IS HE NOW?

11:47.975 --> 11:50.978
- [on video] I'LL BET
HE'S WATCHING US RIGHT NOW.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.788
- WAIT, THIS IS
FREAKING ME OUT.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.891
MY KITCHEN. MY BEDROOM.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.292
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHO TOOK THESE?

12:05.325 --> 12:08.161
- DO YOU KNOW A JASON ROBERTS?

12:08.195 --> 12:10.764
- JASON?

12:10.798 --> 12:12.265
YEAH, HE'S MY I.T. GUY.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.102
- HE'S ALSO YOUR STALKER.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.906
- HE PUT CAMERAS
IN MY APARTMENT?

12:18.939 --> 12:21.842
- MEGHAN,
HOW'D YOU MEET JASON?

12:21.875 --> 12:25.112
- A GIRL IN MY ACTING CLASS
SET ME UP WITH HIM.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.346
HE HELPED ME
DESIGN MY WEBSITE.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.348
NEVER EVEN CHARGED ME.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.118
- JASON BOUGHT A TICKET
TO THE SHOW THE OTHER NIGHT.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.820
DID YOU INVITE HIM?

12:32.853 --> 12:35.956
- NO.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.025
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HE WAS THERE.

12:38.058 --> 12:41.428
- SO YOU CAN'T TELL US
IF HE'S THE ONE WHO RAPED YOU.

12:41.461 --> 12:46.900
- I DON'T THINK SO.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.036
HE SEEMS SO HARMLESS.
HE'S KINDA SWEET.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.239
- HE VIDEOTAPED YOU
WHILE YOU SLEPT.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.573
WHILE YOU SHOWERED.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.508
- OH, MY--

12:55.542 --> 12:57.244
DID YOU ARREST HIM?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.478
- WELL, HE KNOWS THAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR HIM,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.447
BUT, UM, BUT HE HASN'T
BEEN HOME YET.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.984
- SO HOW DO YOU GET IN TOUCH
WITH HIM--EMAIL, TEXT?

13:04.017 --> 13:05.285
- I CALL HIM.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.188
HE ALWAYS CALLS RIGHT BACK.
- GOOD.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.589
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT,

13:09.622 --> 13:13.160
WE WANNA SET UP A MEETING
WITH YOU TWO.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.296
- DOES HE KNOW THAT I KNOW
ABOUT THE CAMERAS?

13:16.329 --> 13:19.066
- MAYBE YOU CAN CONVINCE HIM
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.341
IF IT'S TOO MUCH,
WE'LL FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.899
- JASON, YOU CAME.

13:51.932 --> 13:56.103
- YOU SAID YOU NEEDED ME.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.271
I SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.440
THE COPS, THEY CAME
TO MY APARTMENT.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.175
MY MOM'S FREAKING OUT.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.945
- I TOLD THEM
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.048
I WANNA HEAR YOUR SIDE.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.050
- OKAY, ABOUT THOSE CAMERAS,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.852
THEY'RE FOR SECURITY--
- HEY, JASON. ON YOUR FEET.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.890
- YOU SET ME UP?

14:16.924 --> 14:19.893
- YOU SPIED ON ME
IN THE SHOWER.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.895
WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO?

14:21.929 --> 14:23.964
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.165
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I LOVE HER.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.366
- OH, PLEASE.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.367
- LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
AT THE PRECINCT.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.469
- YOU LOOK PRETTY.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.173
- HEY.
- I GOT UPSET, I'M SORRY.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.507
- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.076
YOU DID GOOD.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.346
REAL GOOD.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.117
- I INSTALLED THOSE CAMERAS
FOR SECURITY

14:44.151 --> 14:45.452
TO MAKE SURE MEGHAN
WAS SAFE.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.388
- FROM WHAT?
SLIPPING IN THE SHOWER?

14:48.421 --> 14:51.291
- SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.993
THERE'S A LOT OF CREEPS
OUT THERE.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.528
SHE'S TRUSTING.
AND I WATCH HER TO PROTECT HER.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.198
- SO IS THAT WHY YOU USED
YOUR MOMMY'S CREDIT CARD?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.666
SAW THE SHOW 12 TIMES?

14:59.699 --> 15:03.336
- MAYBE YOU WERE STAKING OUT THE
SHOW, FIGURING WHEN TO STRIKE.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.706
- WHAT IS EVERYONE
TALKING ABOUT?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.342
- JASON, YOU MAY HAVE BEEN
HIDING BEHIND A GOAT MASK--

15:09.376 --> 15:10.543
- I WAS A DONKEY.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.046
- BUT WE KNOW YOU RAPED HER.

15:17.584 --> 15:22.722
- WAIT A MINUTE, THE GUY
IN THE GOAT MASK RAPED HER?

15:22.755 --> 15:26.493
- WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID, JASON.
DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.399
- IT WASN'T ME,
I CAN PROVE IT.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.740
I TOOK VIDEO.
I SAW THE WHOLE THING.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.342
MEGHAN PLAYED IT
AS IF SHE'D BEEN ATTACKED.

15:42.375 --> 15:46.113
I THOUGHT
SHE WAS JUST ACTING.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.649
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.452
MY GOD.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.454
[hard slap]

15:54.487 --> 15:57.190
[slapping]

16:05.365 --> 16:08.235
- [crying] HELP ME!

16:08.268 --> 16:11.004
HELP! LET GO!
[electronic screeching]

16:11.038 --> 16:13.673
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

16:13.706 --> 16:15.508
NO!

16:15.542 --> 16:16.743
- WELL, THAT'S THE UPSIDE
OF HAVING A STALKER.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.278
HE FILMS YOUR ATTACK.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.213
- PROVES JASON DIDN'T DO IT.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.349
- WELL, HE'S STILL ON THE HOOK
FOR UNLAWFUL SURVEILLANCE

16:22.382 --> 16:23.483
FOR THE SHOWER CAM.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.085
- WHAT WAS THAT SOUND?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.720
- IT SOUNDED LIKE
ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.459
- [crying] HELP ME!
- AND LOOK.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.461
THE HAND GOES AWAY
AND THEN THE SOUND STOPS.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.030
THE HAND GOES BACK TO HER.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.331
- THESE GUYS WERE WORKING
TOGETHER.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.799
MAYBE THEY'RE WEARING
AN EARPIECE.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.401
- IT'S AN ELECTRONIC SQUEAL.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.172
IT COULD BE A HEARING AID
BATTERY RUNNING DOWN.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.640
- OR IT COULD BE ONE OF THOSE
ASSISTIVE LISTENING DEVICES

16:47.674 --> 16:49.809
THAT THEY RENT OUT.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.213
- SO I FORGOT TO RETURN
THE HEADSET.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.481
IF I'D RAPED SOMEBODY,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.483
I WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT MY I.D.
AT THE THEATER.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.418
- YOU GOT OUT OF THERE
IN A HURRY.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.787
- I WAS ON DEADLINE.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.689
I'M A THEATER CRITIC.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.159
IF I WANT TO...ASSAULT
AN ACTRESS,

17:06.193 --> 17:08.461
I'D DO IT IN PRINT.

17:08.495 --> 17:13.733
BESIDES, I FIND MS. WELLER
TO BE QUITE A PROMISING INGENUE.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.603
- THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE
YOUR REVIEW DIDN'T MENTION

17:16.636 --> 17:18.638
PINNING DOWN THE INGENUE.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.673
- I WAS PARTICIPATING.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.111
SHOW'S INTERACTIVE.
- HUH.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.845
YOU INTERACTED IN A RAPE.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.348
AN ACTUAL RAPE.
- WHAT?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.217
- YEAH, YOU JUST MADE YOURSELF
AN ACCOMPLICE.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.351
- NO.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.254
NO! IT WASN'T REAL.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.522
I--

17:35.555 --> 17:37.690
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL
PART OF THE ACT.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.326
I SWEAR TO GOD!

17:39.359 --> 17:40.427
- YOU WERE JUST WAITING
ON YOUR TURN.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.497
- NO! I GOT CAUGHT UP IN IT,
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.734
- STAGE FRIGHT?
NOT LIKE YOUR BUDDY.

17:47.767 --> 17:52.205
- I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS.
HE WAS WEARING A GOAT MASK.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.673
- WELL, DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

17:53.706 --> 17:56.209
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
TO I.D. HIM?

17:56.243 --> 17:59.579
- YOU SHOULD REALLY
THINK HARD.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.221
- YES.

18:08.255 --> 18:12.359
WHEN HE PULLED HER HAIR,
HE WAS WEARING CUFF LINKS.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.229
I ONLY SAW ONE.

18:16.263 --> 18:21.134
IT WAS ENGRAVED
WITH THE WORD "SUSTAINED."

18:28.941 --> 18:31.144
- PLEASE TELL ME
WE CAN CHARGE THIS GUY.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.912
- HE ADMITTED ACTING
IN CONCERT ON A RAPE.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.348
- HE ADMITTED TO NOT KNOWING
SHE WAS BEING RAPED.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.217
IT WAS DARK,
CONFUSING.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.586
- YEAH, I'M NOT SO IMPRESSED
WITH THAT DEFENSE.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.887
- WELL, YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE

18:40.920 --> 18:42.622
THAT THIS GUY WAS JUST
CLUELESS.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.657
- HE SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.227
I'LL CALL THE D.A.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.629
- OKAY, THE THEATER HANDED OUT
20 GOAT MASKS.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.366
LET'S SEE IF THOSE CUFF LINKS
CAN NARROW IT DOWN.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.901
- GOTCHA.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.203
HERE'S SOMETHING.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.371
SUSTAINED/OVERRULED
CUFF LINKS.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.472
POPULAR GIFT FOR LAWYERS.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.541
- WE CROSS-REFERENCED
THE NAMES OF TICKET HOLDERS

19:01.574 --> 19:03.876
WHO ARE MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK
CITY BAR ASSOCIATION.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.545
- TURNS OUT THERE WERE
EIGHT LAWYERS

19:05.578 --> 19:06.746
IN THE AUDIENCE THAT NIGHT.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.416
- INCLUDING
JUDGE GERALD CRANE.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.783
WELL, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.585
THIS CASE JUST KEEPS GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.421
- FITS THE DESCRIPTION.
I KNOW THIS GUY.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.555
HE SMOKES LIKE A CHIMNEY.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.924
- BUT IF THE JUDGE WAS PLANNING
ON RAPING AN ACTRESS,

19:17.957 --> 19:20.660
WHY BUY A TICKET
WITH HIS OWN CREDIT CARD?

19:20.693 --> 19:21.761
- DO ME A FAVOR.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.430
GO TO HIM FIRST,
RULE HIM OUT,

19:23.463 --> 19:25.465
AND THEN APOLOGIZE.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.269
AND, AMARO, LET BENSON
DO THE TALKING.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.377
[knocking]
- YES?

19:37.410 --> 19:40.647
AH, DETECTIVES.
PLEASE COME IN.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.714
I'M DUE ON THE BENCH
IN TWO MINUTES,

19:41.748 --> 19:46.753
SO FORGIVE ME
WHILE I GATHER MYSELF.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.355
- NICE CUFF LINKS.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.490
- AH, YES, THANK YOU.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.393
I'M DIFFICULT TO SHOP FOR,
SO NOW I HAVE ALL OF THEM.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.329
GAVELS, SCALES--
- SUSTAINED, OVERRULED.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.665
- WHAT I COULD REALLY USE
IS "SIT DOWN" AND "SHUT UP."

19:58.698 --> 20:00.300
BUT YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT CUFF LINKS.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.701
HOW CAN I HELP?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.336
- FOUR NIGHTS AGO,
YOU ATTENDED A PERFORMANCE

20:03.370 --> 20:06.673
OF NINE CIRCLES.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.008
- I DID.
IT WAS VERY CREATIVE.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.377
I RECOMMEND IT.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.245
- NOW DID YOU KNOW
THERE WAS A RAPE

20:12.279 --> 20:13.280
IN THE THEATER THAT NIGHT?

20:13.313 --> 20:14.947
- NO.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.850
NO, THAT'S TERRIBLE.
BACKSTAGE?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.252
- IT WAS, UH, DURING
THE SHOW, ACTUALLY.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.454
ON THE LUST SET.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.956
THE VICTIM PLAYED
FRANCESCA.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.693
- YEAH, THE PERP
WORE A GOAT MASK.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.773
- YOUR HONOR, I'M, UH...

20:40.807 --> 20:42.909
I'M SURE THAT
YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.813
- BETTER--AN ADMISSION.
IT WAS ME.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.515
BUT IT WASN'T RAPE.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.283
MEGHAN WANTED IT.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.918
THAT IS TO SAY THAT
SHE ARRANGED THE ENTIRE THING.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.487
IT WAS HER FANTASY.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.498
- MEGHAN WELLER HAS BEEN
EMAILING MY CLIENT FOR WEEKS,

21:05.532 --> 21:08.335
DETAILING THE SEXUAL ENCOUNTER
SHE INITIATED.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.636
NOW THE JUDGE
HAS PROCLIVITIES.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.704
I KNOW, I WAS MARRIED
TO THE MAN FOR TEN YEARS.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.673
BUT HE'S NO RAPIST.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.776
- YOUR EX-WIFE IS REPRESENTING
YOU ON A RAPE CHARGE.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.778
- THERE IS NO RAPE CHARGE
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO RAPE.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.480
- CAN EVERYONE STOP
SAYING RAPE?

21:20.513 --> 21:21.881
- OKAY, JUDGE CRANE,

21:21.914 --> 21:24.484
THE YOUNG WOMAN IS MAKING
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.753
- THEN IT'S A SHAKEDOWN.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.655
- HAS SHE CONTACTED YOU?

21:28.688 --> 21:30.457
- NO, BUT THERE'S NO OTHER
EXPLANATION.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.991
SHE SET THE WHOLE THING UP.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.494
I WAS INVITED THERE
TO SATISFY HER.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.696
- SO WHERE
DID YOU TWO MEET?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.097
- THEY MET THROUGH
THE SUGARBABYZ WEBSITE.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.033
YOU'VE HEARD OF IT.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.503
- WEALTHY OLDER MEN LOOKING
FOR YOUNG WOMEN TO EXPLOIT.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.004
- WHO'S BEING EXPLOITED HERE?

21:45.037 --> 21:46.706
EITHER IT WAS A MUTUAL FANTASY

21:46.739 --> 21:48.775
OR SHE'S USING MY CLIENT'S
PENSION FOR KINKY SEX

21:48.808 --> 21:50.042
TO SET HIM UP.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.079
- ROLE PLAYING IS HEALTHY
FOR CONSENTING ADULTS.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.715
- DID YOU PAY MEGHAN?
- NEVER GOT THAT FAR.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.350
WE ONLY MET THAT NIGHT
ONSTAGE.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.519
SHE SAID IN THE EMAIL
THAT SHE WANTED OUR FIRST TIME

21:59.552 --> 22:02.021
TO BE A STRANGER
RAPE FANTASY.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.624
TOLD ME WHERE TO GO, WHEN,
WHAT SHE'D BE WEARING.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.360
THAT SHE WANTED IT
QUICK, ROUGH, AND PUBLIC.

22:07.394 --> 22:10.363
- LOOK, SHE CLAIMS
THAT SHE FOUGHT YOU.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.565
- AND SHE WROTE IN THIS EMAIL,
DATED FIVE DAYS AGO,

22:12.599 --> 22:15.001
"IF I RESIST,
IT ONLY MEANS I WANT YOU MORE."

22:15.034 --> 22:16.903
- WE HAD A SAFE WORD.
DIXIE.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.405
IF IT WENT TOO FAR,
SHE'D SAY IT.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.539
SHE DIDN'T.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.707
- WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE
SHE WAS SCARED.

22:20.740 --> 22:21.541
YOU WERE PULLING HER HAIR.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.542
SOMEONE ELSE IS HOLDING
HER WRISTS.

22:22.575 --> 22:27.980
- FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE EMAILED THAT GUY TOO.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.852
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.
WHY WOULD I RISK ARREST?

22:32.885 --> 22:33.920
MY REPUTATION?

22:33.953 --> 22:36.122
- ALL DUE RESPECT, JUDGE,

22:36.155 --> 22:40.126
YOU WERE HAVING SEX
IN A PUBLIC THEATER.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.995
- IF I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
THAT IT WENT TOO FAR,

22:43.029 --> 22:44.130
I WOULD'VE STOPPED.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.832
I DON'T ENJOY HURTING WOMEN.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.501
- WHATEVER STORY
THIS ACTRESS TOLD YOU,

22:48.535 --> 22:50.169
SHE WANTS MONEY
OR PUBLICITY.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.771
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
BEING DRAMATIC.

22:51.804 --> 22:52.839
- SHE BELIEVES THAT
SHE WAS RAPED.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.107
SO WHATEVER HE BELIEVED...

22:55.141 --> 22:58.044
YOUR CLIENT STILL
MAY BE GUILTY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.580
- GOOD LUCK GETTING
THE D.A. ONBOARD.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.953
- INGENUE SEEKING PATRON.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.488
SO THE JUDGE IS
TELLING THE TRUTH.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.889
- SHE HAS A PROFILE
ON A WEBSITE.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.425
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
SHE SOLICITED HER OWN ASSAULT.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.994
- OKAY, SOMEBODY TELL ME
HOW THIS WEBSITE'S STILL LEGAL.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.563
ISN'T THIS PROSTITUTION?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.965
- YEAH, BUT THE GIRLS
NEVER NAME A PRICE.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.868
THERE'S NO DIRECT
SEX-FOR-CASH AGREEMENT.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.803
- THESE GIRLS ARE
STILL TRANSACTING SEX

23:23.836 --> 23:25.505
FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.073
- SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF MARRIAGES I KNOW.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.742
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WE'VE GOT A SITTING JUDGE

23:29.776 --> 23:32.044
WITH AN IMPECCABLE
REPUTATION AND NO HISTORY

23:32.078 --> 23:35.782
OF PRIOR BAD BEHAVIOR
CLAIMING HE WAS SET UP.

23:35.815 --> 23:38.050
NOW MAYBE THIS GIRL
PLAYED HIM AND US.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.486
- IF SHE WANTED
TO BLACKMAIL THE JUDGE,

23:39.519 --> 23:41.153
WOULDN'T SHE HAVE GONE
STRAIGHT TO HIM...

23:41.187 --> 23:42.822
INSTEAD OF
CALLING THE POLICE?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.791
- AND IF THE JUDGE WANTED
TO WORK OUT SOME KINKS,

23:44.824 --> 23:46.092
THERE ARE EASIER WAYS.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.928
I MEAN, WHY CHANCE
DESTROYING HIS CAREER?

23:48.961 --> 23:51.731
- SERIOUSLY?

23:51.764 --> 23:53.099
THE GUY LIKES RISKS.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.836
- DOESN'T MEAN HE'S A RAPIST.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.972
I WOULDN'T PUT ANYTHING
PAST JASON.

24:00.006 --> 24:04.143
AND MEGHAN AND THE JUDGE,
THEY COULD BOTH BE VICTIMS.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.812
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST STEP,

24:05.845 --> 24:10.883
SEE IF MEGHAN CAN EXPLAIN
THESE EMAILS.

24:10.917 --> 24:15.154
- "I WANT YOU
TO TAKE ME FROM BEHIND

24:15.187 --> 24:18.925
WHILE EVERYONE WATCHES
AND NO ONE KNOWS."

24:18.958 --> 24:21.060
OH, GOD.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.663
WELL, YOU DON'T THINK
I WROTE THAT.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.832
- JUDGE GERALD CRANE SAYS

24:25.865 --> 24:27.900
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN EMAILING
FOR WEEKS.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.670
- I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF A GERALD CRANE.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.971
IS HE THE ONE--

24:32.004 --> 24:34.807
- HE CLAIMS THAT YOU ASKED HIM
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU

24:34.841 --> 24:36.042
DURING THE PERFORMANCE.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.677
- WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?

24:37.710 --> 24:39.078
- SO THIS IS NOT
YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT?

24:39.111 --> 24:40.980
- NO.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.716
I STILL USE
MY COLLEGE EMAIL.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.885
- DID YOU EVER SET UP
A PROFILE ON A WEBSITE

24:45.918 --> 24:47.554
CALLED SUGARBABYZ?

24:47.587 --> 24:50.489
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.832
- THAT IS YOU.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.802
- WELL, YEAH, BUT--

25:02.835 --> 25:04.704
"INGENUE SEEKING PATRON.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.640
LET ME GIVE YOU
A PRIVATE AUDITION."

25:07.674 --> 25:12.845
NO, I DIDN'T WRITE THAT!
I DIDN'T PUT UP A PROFILE.

25:12.879 --> 25:15.748
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
DO YOU?

25:15.782 --> 25:18.551
- WE DO BELIEVE YOU.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.152
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.589
SAME AS YOU, MEGHAN.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.290
- THAT IS MY PHOTO,

25:24.323 --> 25:26.993
BUT I DIDN'T PUT IT UP
ON THAT WEBSITE.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.800
- THAT PICTURE?
THAT'S NOT FROM ME.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.134
IF I WAS GONNA SET UP MEGHAN,

25:35.167 --> 25:38.705
I'VE GOT IMAGES THAT ARE
A LOT HOTTER.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.807
SEE?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.208
- REALLY?

25:42.241 --> 25:45.612
JASON, YOU JUST MADE BAIL
ON A SURVEILLANCE CHARGE.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.047
- WHAT KINDA CAMERA IS THAT?
IS THAT MOTION ACTIVATED?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.716
- WITH CUSTOM INSTALLED
NIGHT VISION.

25:49.749 --> 25:53.085
- MOTION ACTIVATED'S TERRIFIC...
UNTIL SHE GETS A CAT.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.186
- YOU ADJUST THE
FLOOR-TO-CEILING PARAMETERS.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.688
- GUYS, GUYS, GUYS!

25:55.722 --> 25:56.989
WE'RE HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THESE EMAILS.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.725
MEGHAN SAYS SHE DIDN'T SET UP
THAT ACCOUNT.

25:58.758 --> 26:02.128
- MEGHAN CAN BARELY FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TURN HER LAPTOP ON.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.229
PRETTY ADORABLE.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.331
- SO YOU SET IT UP.
- NO, I DID NOT.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.799
DID YOU CHECK THE IP ADDRESS

26:06.833 --> 26:07.967
TO SEE WHERE THE EMAILS
ORIGINATED?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.302
- PLEASE.
CAFE GANSEVOORT.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.704
- ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE THEATER.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.939
WHICH IS PRETTY CONVENIENT
FOR YOU

26:12.972 --> 26:15.174
SEEING AS YOU SAW THE SHOW
12 TIMES AND ALL.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.375
- GIMME THE DATES,
GIMME THE TIMES

26:16.408 --> 26:17.810
AND WE'LL CLEAR ALL THIS UP
RIGHT NOW.

26:17.844 --> 26:22.281
- OKAY, THREE WEEKS AGO.
6:30 P.M.

26:22.314 --> 26:25.284
TUESDAY, 11:50 P.M.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.621
THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY,
7:06 P.M.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.389
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

26:30.422 --> 26:34.260
- THOSE TIMES...

26:34.293 --> 26:38.364
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE,
I WAS OTHERWISE ENGAGED.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.400
- OH, MAN, YOU WERE
RUBBING YOUR MOTHER'S FEET?

26:41.433 --> 26:44.070
- THURSDAY NIGHT
AT 7:06.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.273
THESE CAMERAS REALLY ARE
FOR SECURITY.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.109
- THE EMAILS WERE SENT
FROM CAFE GANSEVOORT.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.211
JASON HAS AN ALIBI.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.080
- DOES ANYBODY ELSE
FROM THE PRODUCTION GO THERE?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.915
- WE ALL DO.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.350
- HAVE YOU HAD ANY ISSUES
WITH OTHER ACTORS?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.219
MAYBE SOMEONE IN THE CREW.
- NO.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.988
WE WERE ALL A FAMILY.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.122
- HOW ABOUT DATING HISTORY?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.825
MAYBE A RELATIONSHIP
DIDN'T END WELL?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.426
- NO.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.161
ALL MY EXES ARE FRIENDS.

27:09.195 --> 27:13.966
SOME OF THEM SENT ME FLOWERS
OPENING NIGHT.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.335
- JUDGE CRANE WAS EITHER
AT A FUNDRAISER

27:16.368 --> 27:19.038
OR LECTURING ON PRIVACY LAW
AT HUDSON U.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.040
EVERY TIME AN EMAIL WAS SENT.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.175
- CAFE GANSEVOORT ANY HELP?

27:23.209 --> 27:25.411
- NO SECURITY CAMERAS.
CASH ONLY.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.979
100 PEOPLE IN THERE A NIGHT,

27:27.013 --> 27:29.315
INCLUDING ALMOST EVERYBODY
FROM THE THEATER.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.383
- IT COULD'VE BEEN ONE OF HER
CO-WORKERS.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.385
THIS GIRL GREW UP SHELTERED.

27:33.419 --> 27:36.255
SHE MIGHT NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE
A PREDATOR.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.726
- MAYBE JASON'S CAMERAS DID.

27:39.759 --> 27:43.963
- KISS ME.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.265
- TED!
- WHAT?

27:46.298 --> 27:50.102
LOOK, THE SCENE CALLS
FOR A VISCERAL RESPONSE.

27:50.136 --> 27:53.840
YOU CRAVE HIS HANDS ON YOUR
BODY, HIS LIPS ON YOUR LIPS.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.708
- I KNOW, I--

27:55.742 --> 27:57.977
I JUST WASN'T EXPECTING
YOUR TONGUE IN MY MOUTH.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.979
- I PLAYED THE MOMENT, OKAY?

28:00.012 --> 28:02.849
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING

28:02.882 --> 28:05.217
ON THE STAGE.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

28:05.251 --> 28:10.122
- LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.
KISS ME.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.825
- THAT'S HER DIRECTOR
TED SCOTT.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.794
HE'S BEEN OVER TO MEGHAN'S
APARTMENT EIGHT TIMES

28:14.827 --> 28:17.429
IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS
FOR THIS SCENE WORK.

28:17.463 --> 28:21.834
- OKAY, SO HE SETS UP
HIS STAR ACTRESS TO BE RAPED.

28:21.868 --> 28:22.935
TO WHAT END?

28:22.969 --> 28:24.336
- FOR THE PUBLICITY.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.774
THE RAPE STORY COMES OUT
YESTERDAY.

28:27.807 --> 28:30.176
THE TICKET SALES ARE
THROUGH THE ROOF NOW.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.978
- SO HE GETS A TWO-FOR?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.512
HE GETS BACK AT MEGHAN
FOR TURNING HIM DOWN

28:33.545 --> 28:35.481
AND HIS TICKET SALES
SPIKE UP?

28:35.514 --> 28:37.283
- AND THE JUDGE?

28:37.316 --> 28:38.985
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.152
- MAYBE NOT.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.789
I FOUND OUT THAT CRANE PRESIDED
OVER TED'S FIRST DIVORCE

28:42.822 --> 28:45.057
TEN YEARS AGO
AND IT ENDED PRETTY NASTY.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.827
- NO, IT'S ALL STILL
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.896
IS THERE ANYTHING--ANYTHING--
TYING HIM TO THE EMAILS?

28:49.929 --> 28:50.830
- I THINK SO.

28:50.863 --> 28:53.265
I DID A COMPARATIVE
STATEMENT ANALYSIS.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.969
I TOOK TED'S PRESS RELEASE
AND THE RAPIST'S EMAIL...

28:57.003 --> 28:59.839
AND THEY BOTH USE BRITISH
SPELLING AND GRAMMAR.

28:59.872 --> 29:02.775
SO IT'S LIKE, UM,
"THEATRE" WITH AN "R-E."

29:02.809 --> 29:05.544
UM, AND "TOWARDS"
INSTEAD OF TOWARD.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.179
YOU KNOW, SUBJUNCTIVE TENSE.

29:07.213 --> 29:11.317
AND THEN THERE'S THIS
LITTLE COINCIDENCE.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.152
- DIXIE?

29:13.185 --> 29:15.421
THAT WAS JUDGE CRANE'S
ROLE PLAY SAFE WORD.

29:15.454 --> 29:20.126
- IT'S ALSO THE NAME OF TED'S
FIRST NEW YORK PLAY.

29:27.066 --> 29:30.369
- JEEZ, THE DIRECTOR,
THE I.T. GUY,

29:30.402 --> 29:32.839
THE JUDGE--
JUST PICK YOUR PERVERT.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.406
- WELL, A PRETTY GIRL,
NEW TO NEW YORK CITY,

29:34.440 --> 29:37.076
EVERY GUY SHE MET SAW HER
AS EASY PREY.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.310
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.012
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED SVU?

29:40.046 --> 29:41.814
- [scoffs] DON'T ASK!

29:41.848 --> 29:44.183
- NO, IT'S JUST, HOW DO YOU
TRUST ANY MAN, EVER,

29:44.216 --> 29:46.986
AFTER WORKING THIS JOB
DAY IN, DAY OUT?

29:48.888 --> 29:50.890
- I TRUSTED MY PARTNER.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.558
- YEAH, OKAY.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.296
- I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP HOPE.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.331
THERE ARE GOOD GUYS
STILL OUT THERE.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.508
- GIOVANNI JUST LEFT.
- ARE YOU SURE?

30:09.541 --> 30:10.877
THEN KISS ME.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.512
- FRANCESCA, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

30:13.545 --> 30:16.382
GUARDS, GET OUT!

30:18.250 --> 30:20.486
- GIOVANNI...NO!

30:20.519 --> 30:23.122
- GUY CAN'T HELP HIMSELF.
- DO YOU MIND?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.123
THIS IS NOT THE BEST TIME.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.424
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A BLOCKING REHEARSAL.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.159
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

30:27.193 --> 30:30.229
YOUR ACTRESS GETS ATTACKED,
AND YOU USE IT IN YOUR SHOW?

30:30.262 --> 30:32.331
- I DRAW INSPIRATION
FROM LIFE.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.933
I'M GOING FOR THE META.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.435
AND YOU'RE MISSING
YOUR SHOW TONIGHT.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.880
- I ADORE MEGHAN.
I WOULD NEVER HURT HER.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.182
- SHE DOESN'T ADORE YOU.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.284
- NO, SHE DOESN'T.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.552
- YOU GOT THIS ALL WRONG.
IF--

30:53.585 --> 30:57.023
IF I STAGED A RAPE
FOR EVERY ACTRESS

30:57.056 --> 30:59.091
WHO EVER SLAPPED ME DOWN,
WE WOULD BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

30:59.125 --> 31:00.559
- NOT HELPING. TED...

31:00.592 --> 31:01.627
- AND HOW DID--
HOW DID I DO THIS?

31:01.660 --> 31:05.097
- OKAY, SO YOU'RE A REGULAR
AT CAFE GANSEVOORT?

31:05.131 --> 31:07.099
- YES. IT'S ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE THEATER.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.434
- EVER USE THEIR COMPUTERS?

31:08.467 --> 31:12.504
- NO, I DRINK THEIR COFFEE.
IT'S WONDERFUL. WHY?

31:12.538 --> 31:14.406
- BECAUSE SOMEBODY
IMPERSONATING MEGHAN

31:14.440 --> 31:16.042
SET HER UP TO BE RAPED.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.044
THEY USED "DIXIE"
AS A SAFE WORD.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.181
- WAIT. WHAT?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.150
- AND THEN THEY POSTED
A FAKE PROFILE OF HER

31:24.183 --> 31:27.619
ON THE SUGARBABYZ WEBSITE.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.089
AND THEN THEY TRICKED
THIS MAN,

31:30.122 --> 31:31.690
WHO JUST SO HAPPENS
TO BE THE JUDGE

31:31.723 --> 31:33.359
WHO PRESIDED OVER
YOUR DIVORCE,

31:33.392 --> 31:35.995
TO ACTUALLY RAPE HER.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.166
- OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.202
JUST SLOW DOWN
FOR ONE SECOND HERE.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.676
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT THIS IS?

31:50.709 --> 31:54.446
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MEGHAN.
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.682
- MEGHAN WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS RAPED.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.018
- YES, AND THAT IS HORRIBLE.

31:59.051 --> 32:02.321
BUT--BUT DON'T YOU GET IT?

32:02.354 --> 32:04.223
MY DIVORCE JUDGE.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.358
I HAVE AN ACCOUNT
ON SUGARBABYZ.

32:06.392 --> 32:09.228
DIXIE WAS MY PLAY.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.530
I AM THE VICTIM HERE.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.665
I AM THE ONE
WHO IS BEING SET UP.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.968
- BY WHO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.636
THERE'S A LOT OF JEALOUS PEOPLE
IN THE THEATER WORLD.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.039
- ALL RIGHT,
WE CAME IN TO COOPERATE,

32:20.072 --> 32:22.741
BUT THIS DOESN'T SEEM--
- I'M A DIRECTOR.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.576
I HAVE CONTROL ISSUES.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.445
I OBSESS OVER DETAILS.

32:26.478 --> 32:30.582
YET I WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE SET
WHERE MEGHAN WAS ATTACKED.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.252
NOW, DOESN'T THAT TELL
YOU PEOPLE ANYTHING?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.521
- [sighs]
I DON'T SEE ENOUGH

32:35.554 --> 32:37.489
TO CHARGE TED SCOTT
WITH RAPE ONE.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.059
AND I'M NOT CHARGING
A SITTING JUDGE WITH ANYTHING

32:40.092 --> 32:41.527
UNTIL WE HAVE A CLEAR CHAIN
OF THE CRIME.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.629
- CRANE CONFESSED.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.764
- WE HAVE 300 OTHER JUSTICES
WATCHING US

32:45.797 --> 32:47.699
TO SEE HOW WE TREAT THIS JUDGE
WHO'S BEING TARGETED,

32:47.733 --> 32:50.369
POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF HOW
HE PRESIDED OVER ANOTHER CASE.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.705
- IT LOOKS LIKE CRANE WAS USED,
JUST LIKE MEGHAN, BY TED.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.307
- UNTIL YOU CAN PROVE THAT,

32:55.341 --> 32:56.608
I CAN'T CHARGE ANY
OF THE PLAYERS.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.110
- WE HEAR YOU, COUNSELOR.

32:58.144 --> 33:01.113
- THANKS.
KEEP ME POSTED.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.449
- SHE'S LEAVING?

33:03.482 --> 33:06.785
- YEAH, WELL, EVERYTHING
LINKING TED TO THE RAPE

33:06.818 --> 33:08.187
IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.290
- OKAY, CAN WE JUST
TAKE A STEP BACK?

33:11.323 --> 33:14.193
IF TED DID SET THIS UP,

33:14.226 --> 33:15.761
HOW WOULD HE KNOW
THAT THE JUDGE WOULD GO

33:15.794 --> 33:18.497
FOR A PUBLIC RAPE FANTASY?

33:18.530 --> 33:21.067
- THEY WERE BOTH MEMBERS
OF THE SUGARBABYZ WEBSITE.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.702
- SO MAYBE THEY SHARED
FETISH STORIES.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.272
- OR MAYBE THEY SHARED
A SUGAR BABY.

33:31.677 --> 33:35.514
- MEGHAN DIDN'T SEND ME
THESE EMAILS?

33:35.547 --> 33:39.085
- WE DON'T THINK SO, NO.

33:39.118 --> 33:42.121
- THEN I DID RAPE HER.
OH, GOD.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.456
- GERALD, YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.824
- YOUR HONOR,
AT SOME POINT

33:45.857 --> 33:47.759
THE D.A. WILL HAVE
TO FILE CHARGES.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.062
- BECAUSE CHARGING ME IS
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CHARGE

33:50.096 --> 33:51.330
THE REAL PERP.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.166
IT'S KAFKAESQUE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPECTS?

33:54.200 --> 33:57.303
- TED SCOTT.
HE'S MEGHAN'S DIRECTOR.

33:57.336 --> 34:00.439
YOU PRESIDED OVER HIS DIVORCE
TEN YEARS AGO.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.374
ANY WAY THAT HE'S
ANGRY WITH YOU

34:02.408 --> 34:03.642
AND TRYING TO GET BACK AT YOU?

34:03.675 --> 34:06.312
- IS SOMEONE WHO STOOD IN FRONT
OF ME IN A DIVORCE COURT ANGRY?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.246
THEY'RE ALL ANGRY.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.281
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN TOUCH
WITH TED?

34:09.315 --> 34:11.850
MAYBE THROUGH SUGARBABYZ.
YOU'RE BOTH PREMIERE MEMBERS.

34:11.883 --> 34:12.951
DID YOU ATTEND
ANY OF THEIR EVENTS?

34:12.984 --> 34:15.687
- NO. NO, I JUST CORRESPOND
WITH THE YOUNG WOMEN.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.789
- YOU DATED A SERIES
OF SUGAR BABIES.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.125
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU
AND TED

34:19.158 --> 34:21.193
HAVE ANY OF THESE WOMEN
IN COMMON?

34:21.227 --> 34:24.596
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.165
WHY?

34:26.198 --> 34:30.102
- THE EMAILS THAT WERE
SUPPOSEDLY SENT BY MEGHAN

34:30.136 --> 34:34.406
WERE, UM, DESIGNED
TO APPEAL TO YOUR FANTASY.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.843
DETAILS THAT ONLY SOMEBODY
THAT YOU'VE BEEN INTIMATE WITH

34:37.876 --> 34:41.280
WOULD KNOW.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.682
- SO YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH
MY DIRTY LAUNDRY HAMPER.

34:43.715 --> 34:45.651
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE
TO THIS, GERALD.

34:45.684 --> 34:46.818
- SOMEONE COMMITTED A CRIME.

34:46.852 --> 34:52.191
I WANT WHOEVER'S RESPONSIBLE
TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.326
ALL RIGHT, DINA...

34:54.360 --> 34:57.596
WHO'S IN FRONT OF A HOTEL ROOM
WINDOW AT THE STANDARD.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.198
SHE WAS MORE
OF AN EXHIBITIONIST, THAT IS.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.600
LESS OF A RAPE FANTASY.
- KEEP GOING.

35:01.633 --> 35:05.871
- UH, LISA WANTED ME
TO BREAK INTO HER ROOM,

35:05.904 --> 35:07.906
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
ATTACK HER.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.475
SHE WAS CONCERNED
ANYBODY MIGHT FIND OUT,

35:09.508 --> 35:11.543
SO WE KEPT IN TOUCH.

35:11.577 --> 35:15.447
- DID ANYONE WANT TO ROLE PLAY
A RAPE WITH YOU

35:15.481 --> 35:17.849
IN A PUBLIC PLACE?

35:17.883 --> 35:20.719
- YES, THERE WAS ONE...
A BIT PLAIN.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.322
AND IT WAS NOT HER FANTASY,
IT WAS MINE.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.591
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

35:25.624 --> 35:29.461
UH...AH.
ROLE PLAY TOOK PLACE

35:29.495 --> 35:31.597
IN THE DRESSING ROOM
AT BERGDORF'S

35:31.630 --> 35:33.865
WHILE SHE WAS TRYING ON
LINGERIE.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.801
I WOULD BURST IN--
- HOLD ON.

35:35.834 --> 35:40.372
UH, MAY I?

35:43.542 --> 35:47.513
WHEN DID YOU AND SHE
HAVE YOUR...DATE?

35:47.546 --> 35:49.515
- SIX WEEKS AGO, MAYBE.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.882
SHE WROTE BACK,
WANTED TO GET TOGETHER.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.752
- AND TWO WEEKS LATER,
YOU AND MEGHAN STARTED EMAILING.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.188
- YES. THE DAY THAT
SHE POSTED HER PROFILE,

35:56.222 --> 35:58.424
I WROTE--
I WAS INTRIGUED.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.525
- OKAY.
[clears throat]

35:59.558 --> 36:01.627
WE'RE GONNA NEED ALL
YOUR CORRESPONDENCE WITH HER.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.862
- SURE. WELL, THEY'RE ALL
IN THAT iPAD.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.197
I'LL LEAVE IT WITH YOU.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.733
I'LL RELY ON YOUR DISCRETION...
- YES.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.201
- ON ALL THIS.
- ABSOLUTELY.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.470
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR COMING IN, YOUR HONOR.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.905
- I SINCERELY HOPE
IT'S OF HELP.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.813
- WOW. LOT GOING ON
UNDER THOSE ROBES.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.449
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

36:23.482 --> 36:28.420
- THIS IS MEGHAN'S ROOMMATE,
HOLLY SCHNEIDER.

36:28.454 --> 36:31.623
- WELL, THAT CAN'T BE
A COINCIDENCE.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.463
[knock on door]
- MEGHAN.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.468
YOU'RE LEAVING THE SHOW.
- I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.404
IT WAS
ALWAYS SAFE THERE.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.306
- WE THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
FOUND OUT WHO SET YOU UP.

36:49.875 --> 36:53.479
YOUR DIRECTOR, TED.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.614
- TED?

36:55.647 --> 36:58.950
BUT I DON'T UN--

36:58.984 --> 37:00.752
I THOUGHT HE LIKED ME.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.622
- WE SAW THE WAY HE BEHAVED
ON THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.592
- HE COULD BE
A LITTLE HANDSY, BUT--

37:06.625 --> 37:09.495
- MEGHAN, HE TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.962
- SO YOU WERE THERE,
RIGHT, HOLLY,

37:10.996 --> 37:12.964
WHEN TED WAS AROUND?
- YEAH.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.466
ALWAYS.
I ASKED HER TO BE THERE.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.302
- SO YOU KNOW TED TOO,
THEN.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.404
- A LITTLE.
FROM THE THEATER.

37:18.437 --> 37:24.743
- AND ALSO FROM SUGARBABYZ,
RIGHT?

37:24.776 --> 37:28.780
- WE KNOW YOU WENT OUT
ON SOME DATES WITH TED.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.383
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW YOU MET,
ISN'T IT?

37:31.417 --> 37:34.586
- WHAT? HOLLY?

37:34.620 --> 37:35.787
- YOUR ROOMMATE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

37:35.821 --> 37:41.026
OH, YEAH, SHE'S A BIG STAR
ON THAT SITE.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.929
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

37:43.962 --> 37:47.933
- I HAD TO PAY THE RENT.
- BUT SUGARBABYZ--

37:47.966 --> 37:52.704
SOMEONE PUT A FAKE PROFILE
OF ME ON THAT SITE.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.540
- YEAH. TED.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.976
- YEAH, WE'RE NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT, HOLLY.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.313
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:01.347 --> 38:03.649
- WE KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND JUDGE CRANE.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.951
HIS RAPE FANTASIES.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.953
YOU AND HIM IN THE BERGDORF
GOODMAN DRESSING ROOM.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.521
- HOLLY, WHAT ARE THEY
TALKING ABOUT?

38:09.555 --> 38:11.890
- THAT WASN'T ANYTHING.
I NEEDED MONEY.

38:11.923 --> 38:16.528
- OH, RIGHT. BECAUSE YOUR DAD
DOESN'T PAY YOUR BILLS.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.064
- I WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU.
- UH-HUH.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.434
JUST LIKE YOU HELPED HER
WHEN...

38:22.468 --> 38:24.570
YOU GOT THIS ROLE
IN THE PLAY.

38:24.603 --> 38:28.607
NOT YOU.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HOLLY?

38:28.640 --> 38:30.075
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE OKAY
WITH THAT.

38:30.108 --> 38:33.712
- YOU WORKED SO HARD.

38:33.745 --> 38:37.649
HOURS OF REHEARSAL...
SLEEPING WITH THE DIRECTOR.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.351
- IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

38:39.385 --> 38:41.052
- YOU SLEPT WITH TED?

38:41.086 --> 38:42.854
OH, HOLLY, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.956
- YEAH, I DID.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.426
- NO, BUT YOU'RE A BETTER ACTOR
THAN ME--YOU ALWAYS WERE.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.928
- BUT THAT WAS NEVER ENOUGH.
RIGHT, HOLLY?

38:49.961 --> 38:51.397
I GET IT.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.898
YOU KNOW, I'M FROM
A SMALL TOWN TOO.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.366
I COME UP HERE TO THE CITY,

38:54.400 --> 38:55.467
I THINK THINGS ARE GONNA
BE DIFFERENT,

38:55.501 --> 38:56.535
MY LIFE'S GONNA CHANGE.

38:56.568 --> 39:01.106
- YOU DON'T GET IT!

39:01.139 --> 39:03.041
YOU'RE LIKE MEGHAN.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.477
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
IN NEW YORK?

39:05.511 --> 39:07.012
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
A DETECTIVE?

39:07.045 --> 39:08.914
YOU'RE JUST LIKE HER.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.516
EVERYTHING JUST HANDED TO YOU.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.818
GUYS JUMPING UP TO HELP YOU,
NICE APARTMENTS,

39:12.851 --> 39:14.586
UPGRADES TO FIRST-CLASS.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.687
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
SHOW UP.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.489
- AND YOU GET THE PART.

39:17.523 --> 39:20.392
- IT WAS MY AUDITION!

39:20.426 --> 39:22.494
SHE JUST CAME
TO HELP ME RUN LINES,

39:22.528 --> 39:24.696
AND AS SOON AS TED SAW HER,

39:24.730 --> 39:29.835
HE WANTED HER.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.605
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY NO.

39:35.641 --> 39:40.512
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO
FOR THAT AUDITION?

39:40.546 --> 39:44.015
DOWN ON MY KNEES
WITH THAT PIG,

39:44.049 --> 39:46.652
AND WITH CRANE
AND ALL THOSE GUYS.

39:46.685 --> 39:50.689
AND I AM SO TIRED OF BEING
THE UGLY DUCKLING.

39:50.722 --> 39:54.493
AND I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WHAT IT FELT LIKE

39:54.526 --> 39:57.763
TO FEEL DIRTY AND USED.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.499
TO WANT TO GIVE UP.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.905
- HOLLY...

40:06.938 --> 40:10.141
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

40:10.175 --> 40:14.045
YOU HAD SOMEONE RAPE ME!

40:14.079 --> 40:17.649
- IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENED IN YOUR LIFE.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.718
DON'T YOU THINK?

40:23.555 --> 40:25.423
- OKAY.

40:38.537 --> 40:42.974
I DIDN'T SEE OR HEAR
A SHRED OF REMORSE.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.979
WITH ALL THE ABUSIVE MEN
IN HER LIFE,

40:48.013 --> 40:50.682
AND MEGHAN'S BETRAYED
BY A WOMAN.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.489
DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

40:57.523 --> 40:58.924
- YEAH, IT'S HARD ENOUGH
OUT THERE.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.961
YOU'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE
COULD LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.932
GOOD NIGHT.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.603
- GET HOME SAFE.
