13:44.560 --> 13:46.200
I'd be fine with that if you did.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.400

19:38.880 --> 19:41.480
She helps me with my homework
and that stuff all the time.

19:41.560 --> 19:44.400
Maybe she could be a teacher like you.
Or something else.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.880
Hey.
Sully's back on Summerhouse, you know.

26:39.960 --> 26:43.000
My boy just saw him walking in the road.
And guess who he was with?

26:43.560 --> 26:44.640
Dushane Hill.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.960
Dushane's back in Summerhouse?

26:47.320 --> 26:49.200
Yeah. The two of them
must be runnin' it again.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.800
Hold on, wait. This makes no sense.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.640
I swear they had a madness
back in the day.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.440
Well, they must've kissed
and made up, cuz.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.160
'Cause they're shottin'.

26:57.440 --> 27:00.040
They got food, you know.
They got loads of food.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.200
[crew member] So what are we gonna
do about it then?

27:02.280 --> 27:03.880
All's I know... [scoffs]

27:03.960 --> 27:06.440
...we need to do exactly
to Dushane and that fucker Sully

27:06.520 --> 27:08.160
- what we did to Cam.
- [Si] Yes, I'm down.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.960
- Can't let 'em fuck with us.
- Wipe them pussyholes out, innit?

27:11.520 --> 27:13.040
[Leyton] They mad.
See what they did to Modie?

27:13.120 --> 27:14.640
Fucked him up seriously, you know.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.200
That pussyhole needs to pay
for what he done.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.280
Fuckin', we gotta think smart
about that one still.

27:20.360 --> 27:22.000
Think I wanna do something stupid, cuz?

27:22.080 --> 27:24.560
I'm saying if we're gonna do it,
we gotta do it properly, innit?

27:24.760 --> 27:26.440
Lay them all out in one go.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.600
Dushane, Sully and fucking Dris.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.320
Just like what we done to the Turks.

27:31.000 --> 27:31.920
No warning.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.680
That means no one makes a move
till I say so.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.600
Listen, just stay out of Sully's way
till you get the drop, innit?

27:43.040 --> 27:45.040
- [Jaq] You know him?
- [Dris] Nah.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.280
[Jaq] We need to follow him, bruv.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.120
For what? That yout don't run the Fields.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.320
Leyton does.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.360
Take a good look at him.
I'm tellin' you, bruv.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.120
[Jaq] He's the leader.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.000
[Dris] Fuck, bruv.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.040
[lighter clicking]

28:09.200 --> 28:11.840
[Dris] Yo. Them kids we was talkin' about?

28:11.920 --> 28:13.680
We're followin' the leader now.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.200
[Dushane] Who? Leyton?

28:15.280 --> 28:16.760
Nah, bruv. Some next yout.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.040
Listen, I'm stuck somewhere right now.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.960
I'm gonna get Sully
to come and link you, yeah?

28:21.040 --> 28:22.240
- Cool.
- Aight.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.400
Hey, if you need to be somewhere,
I can stay.

28:27.520 --> 28:28.440
I'm good.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
[ringing tone]

28:33.120 --> 28:34.040
[mobile phone beeps]

28:34.120 --> 28:36.560
Yo, Sully. When you get this, call Dris.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.160
[Dushane] Find out where he is,
and go and link him ASAP, yeah?

29:04.720 --> 29:08.800
[sound of fire crackling]

29:26.960 --> 29:29.400
[Jaq] Bro, what the fuck this nigga
doing in a antique store?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.200
[bell jingles]

29:37.000 --> 29:38.680
And you're Jamie.

29:40.360 --> 29:41.200
Yeah.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.080
Lithe.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.440
- 'Scuse me?
- [chuckles]

29:46.080 --> 29:48.600
My name is Lithe.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.040
Nice...

29:55.960 --> 29:57.000
to meet you.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.080
Oh, wow.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.640
Silver.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.320
Yeah.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.640
What?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.000
Your aura.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.720
Beautiful.

30:18.920 --> 30:19.800
Yeah.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.960
- [Jamie] What?
- [Lithe] You're a very caring person.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.440
There's rose in there too.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
[knocking]

30:36.480 --> 30:37.880
Namaste.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.920
[Jamie sighs]

30:41.800 --> 30:44.400
What? Does this lady actually make money
out of a place like this?

30:45.320 --> 30:46.360
It's a front.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.400
From now on,
this is where you bring the money.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.920
Speaking of...

31:26.520 --> 31:27.800
How much did you sell?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.200
Everything. Just like I said.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.560
[chuckles]

31:41.040 --> 31:42.200
Would you like a drink?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.400
Yeah. Why not?

31:55.280 --> 31:56.720
She's a strong lady.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.040
She's gonna be all right.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.800
[heart monitor beeping]

32:04.280 --> 32:05.400
What do I want?

32:08.160 --> 32:11.280
- What I want is for you t...
- You haven't got to talk about this now.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.400
What I want...

32:13.920 --> 32:15.360
is for you to take this.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.680
[sighs] Come on, Dushane.
That's... That's not what I meant.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.680
[murmurs]

32:24.560 --> 32:26.160
I want my mum to get better.

32:26.880 --> 32:30.080
Yeah, we all want that,
but this is about you. What do you want?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.040
I don't know.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.560
You must know.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.240
I don't.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.680
All right, what do you want?

32:43.200 --> 32:46.400
I want to be a part of a real family.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.160
Not a broken one like mine was.

32:51.760 --> 32:53.360
I want a nice house.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.280
It doesn't have to be big or fancy,

32:58.240 --> 33:00.480
just a home,
somewhere you wanna be at night.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.160
I want brothers and sisters
for my little girl,

33:09.360 --> 33:12.240
and a father that loves them
and cares for them.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.160
Someone...

33:14.800 --> 33:17.160
strong, gentle.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.000
I don't want any drama.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.120
Well, maybe just a little bit,
just to keep me on my toes.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.840
But I don't want no games.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.960
And if I find that person,

33:33.040 --> 33:33.880
I'll...

33:34.720 --> 33:36.600
do what I can to make that person happy.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.160
That's what I want.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.240
Well, you're not asking for a lot,
are you?

33:43.800 --> 33:45.000
Really?

33:45.080 --> 33:47.400
'Cause that seems like
the bare minimum to me.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.440
Will you just take it?

33:50.680 --> 33:52.760
What are you trying to say
with this, though?

33:53.440 --> 33:57.160
Oh, my days, you're hard work, man.
Why you making this so difficult?

33:57.240 --> 33:58.720
'Cause I like messin' with your head.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.760
[mobile phone vibrates]

34:00.840 --> 34:03.680
Look, I'm not interested in goin' out,
gettin' wasted

34:03.760 --> 34:05.600
and some guy givin' me jewellery.

34:07.480 --> 34:08.840
I wanna get to know you.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.080
So how'd you get into this game?

34:24.120 --> 34:25.800
There's a lot of drugs in Dublin.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.239
A lot of guns too.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.880
Both my brothers were dealers.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.800
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.199
The younger one, Connor, he got killed.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.480
They kneecapped the other one.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.520
Have you ever kneecapped anyone?

34:41.560 --> 34:42.400
No.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.199
It depends how badly
you wanna hurt the person.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.679
Assuming it's a mild punishment
for something not too serious,

34:49.320 --> 34:52.840
use a small calibre pistol
like a .22 or maybe even a .32.

34:53.880 --> 34:57.120
And you shoot them in the fleshy part
of the thigh or the calf.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.240
They'll be back walking in a day or two.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.960
But what they did with my brother Eamonn,

35:03.560 --> 35:04.840
used a .45.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.840
They put it behind his knee
and they pulled the trigger.

35:08.640 --> 35:12.120
[chuckles] They might as well
have used a saw and sawed off his leg.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.600
But I love Dublin.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.280
Have you ever been?

35:17.800 --> 35:18.760
No.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.880
You'd like it.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.520
You'd be very popular there
with the ladies.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.800
But after a while, it gets kinda small.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That's why I started travelling all over.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.160
America, Africa, Southeast Asia.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.840
I met people who kept saying
if you ever want to get into business,

35:42.920 --> 35:44.400
they'd give me what I needed.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.880
What, so it was your idea, not Jeffrey's?

35:50.920 --> 35:53.040
Does it bother you
to be dealing with a woman?

35:53.360 --> 35:55.320
No. It's cool.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.040
[Lithe] I'm gonna bunk off now, darling.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.080
Unless you need me for anything?

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
Thanks, Lithe.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.320
- I'll lock up.
- [Lithe] Have a lovely time.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.000
- She's such a weird lady.
- [door opens]

36:07.800 --> 36:09.480
- Best accountant ever.
- [door shuts]

36:10.520 --> 36:11.720
And very discreet.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.720
[chuckles]

36:18.320 --> 36:21.160
I'm just gonna count the money
one more time, just to be sure.

36:29.960 --> 36:30.960
He's still in there.

36:32.680 --> 36:33.920
Probably gettin' some, innit?

36:35.600 --> 36:38.200
Well, make it quick,
whoever the fuck you are, bruv.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.720
That's a lot of money.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.360
Yeah, it's just the start.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.760
And you know that.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.320
Wait.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.840
[indistinct chatter]

37:08.920 --> 37:11.320
[ominous music playing]

37:13.200 --> 37:14.440
Lovely seeing you, mate.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.520
Take care.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.080
[laughter]

37:37.120 --> 37:38.040
[sniffles]

37:43.880 --> 37:45.680
That's not happening again, okay?

37:47.720 --> 37:48.640
Okay.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.440
I know what's in your head.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.640
You're a young man.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.240
You have a young man's swagger.

37:57.160 --> 37:59.920
You're thinking,
'No chick says no to me a second time.'

38:00.400 --> 38:01.280
Am I right?

38:02.600 --> 38:03.760
Yeah, somethin' like that.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.240
Yeah. Go out the back way.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.720
I don't want Lithe's neighbours thinking

38:08.800 --> 38:10.920
there's people coming and going
after-hours.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.160
[Lizzie] No.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.520
And the next time, it's business.

38:18.920 --> 38:19.880
Nothin' more.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.080
[door opens, bell jingles]

38:45.040 --> 38:46.640
[Jaq] Bruv, how the fuck did we miss him?

38:49.640 --> 38:51.240
- Dris!
- [Dris] Oi, lady!

38:52.320 --> 38:54.040
I need to speak to your boyfriend.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.400
- What?
- The one you was bangin' a while ago.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.000
- Where is he?
- Blud, leave her.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.840
Listen, I ain't fucking with you.
Where is he?

39:01.920 --> 39:03.480
Let me go. I'm getting into my car.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.200
You're letting go
or I'm calling the fucking police.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.520
- Take her fucking keys, man.
- [Jaq] Gimme the keys.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.520
- Fuck off! Fuck off!
- Gimme the fucking keys!

39:09.600 --> 39:11.040
[mobile phone vibrates]

39:11.640 --> 39:12.760
Work again?

39:13.320 --> 39:14.320
Sorry.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.000
Yo.

39:18.480 --> 39:19.720
[Dris] We lost this guy.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.960
- But I got his girlfriend.
- You what?

39:23.120 --> 39:24.320
What the fuck, man?

39:24.400 --> 39:26.840
Didn't know what to do, bruv.
Had to do something.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.400
- [tsks] I don't wanna hear all of that.
- She was gonna leave, bruv.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.760
Oh, my God. Aight, hear what I'm sayin'.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.240
All right, here's what you're gonna do.
Tell her to call her boyfriend.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.480
Yeah? And tell him to meet
at the Number One caff.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.160
Alone. Tonight.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.160
Just fucking do it, Dris.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.800
I gotta go.

40:02.920 --> 40:03.880
Take this.

Tell me what you can see, bruv.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.640
She's fine.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.080
Trust me.
They'll bring her over in a minute.

41:41.840 --> 41:43.960
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
you know.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.360
The mandem can keep doin'
what they've always been doin'.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.840
Shot whatever to whoever,
I really don't give a fuck, bruv.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.680
Just do it on your ends.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.560
And if you need food, come to me.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.240
So you think I'm here
to get your permission to shot food?

42:04.200 --> 42:06.120
You're here to get mine.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.080
What, you ain't noticed
things have changed?

42:10.160 --> 42:12.080
You're not dealing with
the mandem no more.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.640
You're dealin' with the ZTs.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.360
ZTs?

42:16.080 --> 42:18.240
What's that?
Rubber duckies and bubble bath?

42:20.240 --> 42:23.080
ZTs stand for Zero Tolerance.

42:23.160 --> 42:26.480
For any other gang, for anyone else
shottin' on the streets,

42:26.920 --> 42:28.280
and you'll work for me.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.040
And that's your only option.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.160
I've had a long fuckin' day, bro.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.600
Let me give you a piece of advice.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.680
Do what the fuck I'm telling you to do...

42:45.760 --> 42:46.840
and you won't get hurt.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.760
And we can make some money.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.080
Do you know the last person
that said that to me?

42:56.160 --> 42:59.360
I'd tell you, except I can't pronounce
them Turkish names.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.360
You wanna sell food, you sell my food.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.680
Or you don't sell nothin' at all.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.200
Do you understand what I'm sayin' to you?

43:11.840 --> 43:13.840
Now get that woman in here now, innit?

43:22.560 --> 43:23.960
What's happened to you, man?

43:25.680 --> 43:27.280
You used to be a legend round here.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
[scoffs]

43:35.480 --> 43:38.080
Would the old Dushane Hill
have begged his brother for ten grand?

43:39.440 --> 43:40.400
[Jamie chuckles]

43:54.520 --> 43:56.520

44:26.320 --> 44:28.080
Remember this brown face?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.160
[grunting]

44:31.040 --> 44:32.280
You killed my friend.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.800
[grunts, coughs]

44:47.560 --> 44:48.840
[panting]

44:59.520 --> 45:00.920

45:11.480 --> 45:14.600
[man continues whimpering]

45:26.400 --> 45:27.440
