01:39.209 --> 01:40.112
Dude!

01:47.012 --> 01:50.081
Yeah, don't get up. I got it, bro.

01:55.886 --> 02:00.326
Damn, Finn.
This must be your best one yet.

02:00.426 --> 02:03.729
How long you been workin' on this?
Like two, three weeks?

02:03.829 --> 02:05.857
Fuck off. Okay? I don't go to the bar

02:05.957 --> 02:09.264
and complain when it takes you
10 minutes to make a martini.

02:09.368 --> 02:11.970
I'm perfectly happy with where I'm at.

02:12.070 --> 02:14.484
I just hit a little creative block.
That's all.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.558
Hello?

02:17.658 --> 02:20.078
Oh, hi, Mrs. Anderson.

02:20.178 --> 02:23.682
Why, yes. The building manager's
right here.

02:23.782 --> 02:27.412
Oh, I'm sure he'd be delighted
to come over and fix your toilet.

02:28.087 --> 02:32.832
Yeah. He's givin' me the thumbs up
right now. He'll be over in a second.

02:35.193 --> 02:37.062
You were saying something, right?

02:37.162 --> 02:39.966
About you being perfectly happy
with where you're at in life?

03:09.061 --> 03:11.111
Hello.

03:12.364 --> 03:16.068
Well, he said he was thinking
of going to art school.

03:16.168 --> 03:18.871
And I said, "Oh, what a coincidence!

03:18.971 --> 03:22.809
Our building manager
used to be a painter."

03:22.909 --> 03:25.912
When you're 18,
everybody wants to be an artist.

03:33.076 --> 03:36.054
- Where did you get that?
- Garage sale.

03:36.454 --> 03:37.990
So weird.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.825
I'm seeing...

03:40.325 --> 03:43.395
I'm seeing... seashells.

03:43.495 --> 03:48.801
Outlaw, Rambling Rose, Crab Apple.

03:48.901 --> 03:51.704
- Crabs live in the fucking ocean, right?
- Yes, they do.

03:51.804 --> 03:54.873
Crab Apple. I'm betting on Crab Apple.

03:55.808 --> 03:58.544
Hello, my lost boys.

04:00.012 --> 04:01.705
- New sweater.
- New for me.

04:01.805 --> 04:03.682
It's a thrift store find. You like it?

04:03.782 --> 04:08.087
Oh, I had a little left over,
so I got these for you, babe.

04:09.254 --> 04:11.757
It's the right kind. Camel hair, right?

04:12.157 --> 04:14.052
Thank you. Did you get a new journal?

04:14.152 --> 04:18.296
I knew how much you wanted them,
so I couldn't resist.

04:21.433 --> 04:26.138
Okay, I'm going to go start dinner.
Do you guys want your favorite, lasagna?

05:43.047 --> 05:45.235
Need some help?

05:45.884 --> 05:49.531
Hey, Big Joe. Yes, I do. Thank you.

05:54.793 --> 05:57.496
<i>- Eight is really gettin' taken...</i>
- Come on. Come on.

05:57.896 --> 06:00.733
Come on. That's it. That's it. Come on.

06:01.033 --> 06:05.003
You got this.
Keep fuckin' running. Let's go.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.272
Come on. Come on.

06:07.372 --> 06:10.475
- What's up?
- Hey, Big Ben.

06:10.575 --> 06:12.975
- Come on.
- It's Joe.

06:13.075 --> 06:16.882
Crab Apple. Crab Apple.
Come on, you little bastard! Run!

06:17.232 --> 06:21.636
Come on! Run! Come on! Fuck, man!

06:21.936 --> 06:24.006
Chill out.

06:27.209 --> 06:30.913
Hey, Finn, the landlord called.
Mr. Bezzerides's rent is late.

06:31.613 --> 06:33.615
Maybe he fell, and he can't get up.

06:34.489 --> 06:36.385
He's been late before.

06:36.485 --> 06:38.153
- Oh, the man across the way?
- Yeah.

06:38.253 --> 06:42.057
I noticed a couple
of parking tickets on his car.

06:42.157 --> 06:44.092
I guess he's got a couple
parking tickets on his car,

06:44.192 --> 06:46.461
so maybe we should check on him.

06:46.561 --> 06:49.231
And I also invited Big Joe
to stop by the party.

06:49.331 --> 06:53.101
Okay, but I hope he doesn't wear
that tacky rent-a-cop uniform.

06:53.201 --> 06:55.470
I thought we were just
inviting close friends.

06:55.970 --> 06:58.607
Yeah, well, Big Joe's really cool.

06:58.707 --> 07:01.944
And he's helping me with the chairs.
He's standing here right now.

07:06.448 --> 07:08.450
Don't worry. I own other outfits.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.153
I'm sorry.

07:11.253 --> 07:16.325
I'm just gonna... go check
on Mr. Bezzerides. Okay then.

07:34.809 --> 07:37.813
Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?

07:45.420 --> 07:47.022
Everyone's kinda worried about you,

07:47.122 --> 07:50.358
so I'm going to go ahead
and come inside, okay?

08:04.706 --> 08:07.184
Mr. Bezzerides?

08:35.035 --> 08:36.538
It was a sure thing.

08:36.638 --> 08:39.957
No, it obviously wasn't a sure thing.
He lost, Jasper.

08:40.058 --> 08:42.977
No, he was a sure thing
up until the moment he lost.

08:43.078 --> 08:46.397
That makes zero sense.

09:00.094 --> 09:02.298
What the fuck?

09:05.233 --> 09:07.969
These are shots of our living room.

09:09.237 --> 09:11.506
Mr. "Bitch-arabies" is a peeping tom.

09:11.606 --> 09:16.144
Yeah, I though that, too, but why
take photos of our empty living room?

09:19.514 --> 09:23.342
Looks like he saved the best ones
for his private collection.

09:25.854 --> 09:27.856
What is this thing?

09:33.060 --> 09:34.747
I think it's a camera. See?

09:36.431 --> 09:38.300
Cripes.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.302
You think he got enough film?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.876
What? Do I even want to know?

09:48.076 --> 09:50.879
When did we knock over the coat rack?

09:50.979 --> 09:55.083
Maybe it was that night we played
drunk charades. You remember.

09:55.183 --> 09:59.020
No, he doesn't remember
'cause he passed out on the couch.

10:00.288 --> 10:03.825
Well, I guess this explains the green light
we see over here sometimes.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.228
Yeah, but why is this thing
bolted to the floor?

10:07.595 --> 10:11.233
I don't know, but I don't like it.
I don't like the sound it's making either.

10:12.233 --> 10:14.703
Or how about the half-naked photos
of me on the wall?

10:14.903 --> 10:17.939
That's the one thing I do like
about this situation.

10:24.579 --> 10:26.965
I knew something wasn't right
about that old man.

10:27.165 --> 10:29.301
Hi, Mr. Kendall, this is Finn
from Sycamore Apartments.

10:29.401 --> 10:32.036
I'm calling you back
about Mr. Bezzerides.

10:32.136 --> 10:36.416
If you can please ring me when you get
a chance, that would be great. Thank you.

10:36.516 --> 10:38.978
- What did the landlord say?
- I just left a voice mail.

10:40.845 --> 10:43.682
Okay. I'm off to work.

10:43.782 --> 10:47.786
I counted the cookies, so if any go missing,
there will be murder in this apartment.

10:47.886 --> 10:51.056
- I'll guard 'em.
- Who's going to guard 'em from you?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.043
It's a perfect match.

11:12.143 --> 11:15.680
- It's got to be a coincidence.
- Maybe. Or...

11:15.780 --> 11:19.004
Or what? The camera
took a picture ahead of time?

11:19.104 --> 11:22.454
- Give me a break.
- I mean, just look at it.

11:22.554 --> 11:24.489
The placement of everything, my canvass.

11:24.589 --> 11:27.530
Your canvass has looked
like that for months.

11:28.616 --> 11:29.496
Hey, guys...

11:47.378 --> 11:48.747
No way.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.818
Oh, my God.

11:59.591 --> 12:03.161
This was last Wednesday. Remember
you broke the mug with your four-iron?

12:03.261 --> 12:05.264
Oh, yeah, right.

12:06.198 --> 12:09.468
Thursday. Friday we went to the movies.

12:09.568 --> 12:13.305
Saturday we lost power, used candles.

12:13.405 --> 12:14.706
Sunday.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.807
Monday.

12:17.441 --> 12:19.945
That's tonight, Tuesday.

12:22.046 --> 12:24.092
Tomorrow.

12:26.317 --> 12:27.485
Bullshit.

12:27.785 --> 12:31.990
Mr. "B" invented a camera
that takes pictures of the future,

12:32.090 --> 12:34.893
and he only used it
to look in our apartment?

12:34.993 --> 12:37.829
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Well, maybe he's testing it.

12:38.029 --> 12:40.165
Yeah, and this thing
isn't exactly portable.

12:40.565 --> 12:43.211
Well, he's a scientist, so there's
got to be some sort of logs

12:43.311 --> 12:45.743
or documentation somewhere.
Just start looking.

12:45.843 --> 12:47.772
Will you guys listen to yourselves?

12:48.372 --> 12:50.442
All right. Come on out, Mr. "B."

12:50.542 --> 12:54.045
I know you're fucking in here in the walls
or something, laughing your ass off!

12:54.145 --> 12:57.282
All right, the jig's up!
Come on out, asshole!

12:57.382 --> 12:59.584
I don't think he's going to answer.

12:59.984 --> 13:02.254
- Why?
- "November 27.

13:02.554 --> 13:04.789
Results today: positive function.

13:04.889 --> 13:07.258
The machine continues to work perfectly.

13:07.358 --> 13:11.763
However, I've seen something in the future
that is disturbing to my core.

13:12.063 --> 13:14.999
I believe I've seen my death.

13:17.001 --> 13:19.804
I know the cardinal rule
of time and causality...

13:19.904 --> 13:22.807
is that one should not attempt
to change the future.

13:23.107 --> 13:27.312
But under these circumstances,
it seems to be a risk worth taking.

13:27.612 --> 13:29.381
If I believed in God,

13:29.481 --> 13:33.952
I would pray today that no greater harm
will come from what I'm about to do."

13:36.454 --> 13:38.590
Then what?

13:38.690 --> 13:41.926
Nothing. That's the last entry,
a week ago today.

13:42.326 --> 13:43.995
A week ago.

13:44.095 --> 13:48.466
Seven photos. That means it was
kicking it out after he disappeared.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.069
So it must be on a timer.

13:54.639 --> 13:56.475
8:00 pm.

13:58.376 --> 14:00.645
Then why are there so many daytime ones?

14:00.745 --> 14:03.749
Maybe it's only been taking ones
at night for the last week.

14:05.617 --> 14:06.985
All right.

14:07.085 --> 14:10.655
Even I have to admit this photo
is a little fucking unsettling.

14:18.363 --> 14:20.399
I think I know where he might be.

14:28.473 --> 14:32.110
- Christ. What's he keeping in here?
- I don't know.

14:32.210 --> 14:35.146
Him and the previous manager
added this door years ago.

14:35.246 --> 14:37.448
God, please, oh, please,
don't let him be in there.

14:37.548 --> 14:40.352
There's no way. If there was a dead body
in there, we'd be able to smell it.

14:40.452 --> 14:44.190
- Oh, God.
- What? Is he in there?

14:51.396 --> 14:54.186
Oh, my God. Close it, close it.

14:55.667 --> 14:59.437
What happened to him?
It looked like he was burned.

14:59.737 --> 15:01.573
Yeah, I don't know about that.

15:01.673 --> 15:04.342
I mean, did you see his suit?
It was fine. It wasn't even touched.

15:04.442 --> 15:07.512
Isn't it obvious?
I mean, you read his journal.

15:07.612 --> 15:09.214
He broke the cardinal rule.

15:10.148 --> 15:12.717
You don't fuck with time.

15:30.802 --> 15:33.805
Jasper, please take his hat off.

15:34.372 --> 15:36.674
It's my thinking cap.

15:38.409 --> 15:41.746
What the hell is there to think about?
We need to call the police, guys.

15:41.846 --> 15:44.516
Hang on. That could be a big mistake.

15:45.216 --> 15:46.229
What do you mean?

15:46.329 --> 15:49.587
I mean, we just discovered
a fucking time-traveling camera!

15:49.687 --> 15:51.255
We need to consider the possibilities.

15:51.755 --> 15:55.660
Well, one possibility is we've all been
dosed with lethal amounts of radiation

15:55.760 --> 15:58.196
that... you know,
could've killed Mr. "B."

15:59.096 --> 16:03.205
Okay, Negative Nancy, but...
what if we could use this thing?

16:04.402 --> 16:05.470
How?

16:05.570 --> 16:09.640
Remember how Mr. "B" took a photo
of himself holding that sign?

16:11.325 --> 16:16.080
What if we put up,
like... the newspaper?

16:16.414 --> 16:19.272
- We would know what happens in the future.
- Yeah, the newspaper, Jasper?

16:19.572 --> 16:20.977
What are you thinking?
Arts and Entertainment?

16:21.077 --> 16:23.656
Or are you thinking the race results?

16:24.255 --> 16:27.659
Well, what if? I mean, think about
how much money we could make.

16:29.193 --> 16:30.412
Callie...

16:31.012 --> 16:34.450
I foretell that tonight
is your last night waiting tables.

16:34.750 --> 16:38.503
And instead, you can pursue
writing full time.

16:40.104 --> 16:42.040
Callie?

16:45.710 --> 16:48.546
No! Absolutely not!
We're go... We're calling the police.

16:48.846 --> 16:52.924
Finn, I foretell that you live the rest
of your life in pathetic obscurity

16:53.024 --> 16:54.853
and die penniless and insane.

16:56.287 --> 16:59.390
- I'm serious, Jasper.
- So am I.

16:59.490 --> 17:01.058
Does it look like the cops are here?

17:01.358 --> 17:04.529
That people are buzzing about
the charred corpse in the storage unit?

17:04.829 --> 17:06.164
Everything looks fine.

17:06.844 --> 17:09.400
Look, if we reported it, we probably
wouldn't have had the party anyway.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.717
We'd have canceled it altogether.

17:11.817 --> 17:14.972
We can't cancel it. It's Dave
and Sharon's engagement party.

17:15.071 --> 17:19.277
That's what I'm saying.
Obviously, we don't report it tonight.

17:20.645 --> 17:24.715
There is a dead fucking st...
rotting corpse in the storage unit.

17:24.816 --> 17:27.251
You can't smell anything as long
as we keep the door closed.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.990
It's been down there a week.
What's one more day?

17:34.725 --> 17:36.327
Look.

17:36.427 --> 17:39.664
We let the party happen,
we look at tomorrow's photo, and...

17:39.964 --> 17:45.404
if it shows the cops taking our testimony
and shit, I'll call 'em myself.

17:48.940 --> 17:53.348
I have to admit. I am kind of curious
to see one more photo.

17:57.615 --> 18:00.697
All right. Fine. One day. But...

18:01.349 --> 18:02.958
One day.

18:18.602 --> 18:21.006
- What time is it?
- Twenty till.

18:26.978 --> 18:30.981
Well, just in case tomorrow's photo
shows the end of the world...

18:31.514 --> 18:33.519
I'm going to enjoy myself.

18:41.959 --> 18:44.026
Do you want to dance?

18:46.230 --> 18:49.334
And he adopts
his classic glazed-over look.

18:50.134 --> 18:52.018
What?

20:05.343 --> 20:07.879
You son of a bitch.

20:31.703 --> 20:34.022
Guys! Guys!

20:36.340 --> 20:39.911
- I'm a fucking genius.
- I know, but look at that painting.

20:40.011 --> 20:41.479
Holy shit!

20:41.579 --> 20:44.315
I know. I mean, the camera
sees my work before I do it.

20:44.415 --> 20:47.818
It's just incredible. I don't have
to be blocked anymore!

20:50.621 --> 20:52.448
I'm in.

20:53.223 --> 20:54.926
Yes!

20:55.026 --> 20:56.914
Yes.

21:17.415 --> 21:20.718
You're up early. What time is it?

21:20.918 --> 21:24.623
How about we start with what year is it?

21:26.690 --> 21:28.960
Oh, so you can write
in a dead man's journal,

21:29.060 --> 21:31.229
but I'm not allowed to wear his hat?

21:31.529 --> 21:33.331
This isn't poetry, Jasper.

21:33.731 --> 21:35.566
I'm making our to-do list.

21:35.666 --> 21:37.221
If we're really going through with this,

21:37.321 --> 21:40.205
we need to start making it look
like Mr. B's still around.

21:41.172 --> 21:43.407
I mean, this is actually happening?

21:43.507 --> 21:48.079
What are you talking about, bro?
It already happened. It's done.

21:48.179 --> 21:50.115
Well, I mean, we could
just not go through with it.

21:51.482 --> 21:54.152
Actually, I think we have to.

21:56.053 --> 22:00.260
If I understand this correctly,
this is how it works.

22:01.258 --> 22:04.896
The camera spits out a photo
of us in the future.

22:04.996 --> 22:07.371
Then we go about our day
making a series of decisions

22:07.471 --> 22:09.413
that lead up until that moment.

22:09.817 --> 22:11.020
But...

22:11.120 --> 22:15.873
if we deviate from those decisions,
then this photo never happened.

22:15.973 --> 22:20.845
Which means "us," the people who saw
the original photo, can't go forward.

22:21.345 --> 22:23.447
Because our futures don't exist anymore.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.285
What do you mean "can't go forward"?

22:33.624 --> 22:36.761
I mean, are we 100% sure
that's how he died?

22:37.161 --> 22:41.199
No, but... do you really want
to test it and find out?

22:44.101 --> 22:46.704
So it's agreed then.

22:46.804 --> 22:49.439
We got to do what's in the photo.

22:50.966 --> 22:53.544
Okay, all right, fine.

22:53.811 --> 22:56.180
We have to do this tonight.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.016
But we're talking about
not reporting a dead body.

22:59.116 --> 23:02.854
I'm pretty sure if anybody found out,
Jasper, that's jail time.

23:02.954 --> 23:04.882
Okay, but nobody's going to find out.

23:05.422 --> 23:07.425
I was over there this morning
to make a list.

23:07.525 --> 23:11.779
All we have to do is bring in
his newspapers, water the plants.

23:11.879 --> 23:15.532
We should probably move his car
so it doesn't get any more tickets.

23:15.705 --> 23:17.702
I found a couple pieces of mail.

23:17.802 --> 23:21.172
Maybe a couple bills,
so I should probably post them.

23:24.642 --> 23:26.240
Well, you seem to have everything
figured out.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.880
Dude. Just relax, man.

23:28.980 --> 23:32.651
The risk is so minimal,
it's almost nonexistent.

23:33.851 --> 23:37.184
All we have to do is make sure
that storage unit door stays closed,

23:37.284 --> 23:41.459
and... we become rich.

23:44.628 --> 23:46.097
And you get your paintings.

23:51.435 --> 23:53.238
Yeah.

24:27.705 --> 24:30.975
Come on. Come on. Come on, Bobcat!

24:31.075 --> 24:34.579
Fuck, yes! Fuck, yes!

25:32.703 --> 25:34.806
All right, let's go. It's almost 8:00.

25:34.906 --> 25:38.262
Wait. Do we have to be exactly as we were?
I don't want to change anything.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.308
I don't know. Is this right?

25:40.408 --> 25:42.479
Just smile and say good-bye
to your day jobs, guys.

25:42.579 --> 25:44.349
I mean, we can check the photo.
It's right there.

26:42.173 --> 26:44.908
<i>Henry? Henry, are you there?</i>

26:45.008 --> 26:49.013
<i>It's Joyce. I received your letter.</i>

26:49.113 --> 26:51.783
<i>Could you check in please
when you have time?</i>

26:52.983 --> 26:55.813
<i>I truly hope you're okay.</i>

27:04.962 --> 27:06.964
Hey, Finn!

27:10.534 --> 27:14.171
- Hey, Joe. How's it going?
- Hey, what's going on with the old man?

27:14.271 --> 27:16.640
I see Callie coming around here
in the mornings.

27:16.740 --> 27:18.175
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:18.275 --> 27:20.395
He's sick in the hospital.
We just come by to water his plants

27:20.495 --> 27:22.046
and look after the place for him.

27:22.146 --> 27:24.348
Hospital? Is it serious?

27:25.873 --> 27:30.588
Yeah, it's pretty serious. They're still
trying to figure out what he has.

27:32.055 --> 27:35.159
Damn. It's good you guys
are looking after the place.

27:35.259 --> 27:39.107
Yeah. I mean, we don't mind, so...

27:39.207 --> 27:41.599
But I better get back to it.

27:52.643 --> 27:54.094
No, dude. We're over here tonight

27:54.194 --> 27:57.136
because we're not in the photo
from last night. It's that simple.

27:57.236 --> 28:00.645
Well, it's not like fate decided it. I mean,
presumably, we made decisions yesterday

28:00.745 --> 28:02.620
that made us end up here today.

28:02.720 --> 28:06.790
All right, my brain just kinda melted
a bit. What was the original question?

28:06.890 --> 28:08.766
The question is,
if you could choose something

28:08.866 --> 28:11.529
to show up in the next photo, anything,

28:11.629 --> 28:13.797
what would you choose to see?

28:14.397 --> 28:18.268
I'm a little ashamed at how good
it felt to buy this dress.

28:18.836 --> 28:21.071
Back to the question.

28:21.572 --> 28:22.973
Easy.

28:23.073 --> 28:26.610
I want a pile of money so big
that I'm fuckin' buried in it.

28:26.910 --> 28:28.445
You are so predictable.

28:28.545 --> 28:33.584
Me? What about you?
We all know what you wanna see most.

28:33.784 --> 28:37.454
A rock. So you and Finn
don't have to keep living in sin.

28:37.554 --> 28:39.423
Whatever.

28:39.523 --> 28:40.558
- You hear that, Finn?
- What?

28:40.658 --> 28:41.826
You're off the hook.

28:41.926 --> 28:45.296
Oh, he's just daydreaming about
two paintings a day instead of one.

28:45.396 --> 28:48.920
Well, I don't know.
Just give a guy a second here.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.142
I need to think.

28:52.203 --> 28:55.473
I never get tired of that sound.

29:08.986 --> 29:10.688
Finn.

29:35.979 --> 29:38.949
All right, come on, guys.
It's not like I want to do this.

29:39.349 --> 29:42.285
Okay, then let's not do it!

29:42.785 --> 29:45.356
Do I need to remind you about the roasted
dead guy in our basement?

29:49.626 --> 29:52.096
We got to do
what's in the photo, right, bro?

29:55.766 --> 29:57.101
How the hell did this happen?

29:59.496 --> 30:03.140
I don't know. Maybe it's a fucking dare.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.077
- Maybe we're drunk.
- Maybe it was an accident.

30:06.477 --> 30:10.547
It's a fucking lip lock.
We didn't just bump into each other.

30:16.186 --> 30:18.730
Say something, Finn.

30:19.990 --> 30:22.818
We should destroy that machine.

30:24.294 --> 30:28.004
What? We can't do that.

30:28.298 --> 30:30.187
I know.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.616
It's too late.

30:35.105 --> 30:36.673
It doesn't matter why we do this.

30:36.773 --> 30:38.776
For all intents and purposes,
it already happened.

30:42.010 --> 30:43.584
I mean...

30:46.149 --> 30:48.485
I'm in the room.

30:48.885 --> 30:52.289
I don't look mad or pissed.

30:52.489 --> 30:54.357
The painting's coming out great.

30:54.457 --> 30:57.174
Yeah. The painting's coming out great.

30:57.274 --> 31:00.797
You probably asked us to do it
for inspiration or something.

31:04.434 --> 31:08.806
We're all friends. And we just need
to trust that it's going to be okay.

31:09.973 --> 31:12.543
Fuck! What the fuck was that for?

31:13.543 --> 31:15.313
That's for kissing
my girlfriend tomorrow.

31:27.458 --> 31:30.127
T-minus one hour,
in case you were wondering.

31:30.227 --> 31:34.064
Please, stop counting down
like it's a fucking shuttle launch.

31:34.898 --> 31:37.267
- Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

31:37.367 --> 31:38.924
Yeah, I told you
Crab Apple was a sure thing.

31:39.124 --> 31:40.861
He just needed a few more races.

31:40.961 --> 31:43.390
Yeah, let's roll half the winnings
into tomorrow's bets,

31:43.490 --> 31:46.220
and I'll come pick up the rest.

31:46.944 --> 31:50.981
Okay, yeah. Let me just
get something to write on.

32:01.992 --> 32:05.195
I thought there wasn't
a bottle in the photo.

32:06.363 --> 32:09.838
That's because it was down here.

32:10.434 --> 32:12.870
What time is it, babe?

32:14.705 --> 32:16.573
Finn, you okay?

32:16.673 --> 32:22.079
Yeah, no. It's this part
of the painting... it's unfinished.

32:22.179 --> 32:26.550
I'm clearly about to paint it. I just have
no idea what element goes there.

32:26.650 --> 32:29.038
Okay, Michelangelo, but...

32:29.138 --> 32:34.257
we have to close our eyes to match
the photo. So you're the timekeeper.

32:34.857 --> 32:37.895
Well... Yeah, dude, it's 7:59.
Just go ahead.

32:39.196 --> 32:43.800
Well, how long do we do it for?
10, 15 seconds?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.571
I'll tell you when to stop. Just go.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.643
I'll be thinking about my boyfriend.

32:52.743 --> 32:55.578
Sweet. Threesome.

32:56.013 --> 32:58.462
Come here, asshole.

33:24.590 --> 33:26.677
Of course.

34:42.185 --> 34:45.121
Oh, geez, did you guys...

34:45.554 --> 34:47.449
Hey!

34:54.605 --> 34:56.478
Shit.

35:01.204 --> 35:02.873
- Finn.
- Go get Jasper.

35:02.973 --> 35:05.042
- I just wanted to...
- Go get Jasper!

35:14.084 --> 35:16.887
- Finn, I'm sorry.
- Who is this?

35:26.362 --> 35:29.165
That's my bookie. Ivan.

35:29.665 --> 35:32.135
The guy you're always talking
on the phone to?

35:32.535 --> 35:34.978
What is he doing in the apartment?

35:35.305 --> 35:37.449
- I don't know.
- Is that normal?

35:37.549 --> 35:40.277
Have you ever seen him
in our apartment before?

35:40.377 --> 35:43.380
No. It's not fucking normal.

35:44.581 --> 35:47.918
- Did you tell him about the camera?
- No.

35:48.018 --> 35:49.953
- Were you planning on it?
- No, never!

35:50.053 --> 35:51.598
Then what the fuck is he doing
in the apartment?

35:51.698 --> 35:53.931
I said I don't know!

35:54.031 --> 35:56.093
Okay, is he dangerous?

35:57.994 --> 36:03.100
Well, he takes bets from shady assholes
like me. So, yeah, he's dangerous.

36:05.101 --> 36:08.205
But... I don't see Marcus here.

36:08.305 --> 36:10.507
That's his goon.

36:10.607 --> 36:15.145
If I were in trouble,
he'd be in this photo.

36:16.046 --> 36:19.983
Well, what if he's sitting over here?
Out of view?

36:34.464 --> 36:37.735
I was up early this morning,
and I heard him moving around in his room.

36:38.869 --> 36:43.173
He came out about an hour ago.
Hasn't said a word.

36:43.273 --> 36:48.144
I don't know what those red pills are,
but he's taken at least two of them already.

36:48.544 --> 36:51.300
Can you guys shut up for a sec?

37:09.399 --> 37:10.834
<i>Yeah?</i>

37:10.934 --> 37:13.862
Hey, Ivan, it's Jasper.

37:13.962 --> 37:15.594
<i>I know.</i>

37:17.941 --> 37:19.890
How's it going?

37:19.990 --> 37:21.748
<i>What?</i>

37:23.080 --> 37:25.949
Is everything okay today?

37:26.049 --> 37:27.652
<i>Why wouldn't it be?</i>

37:29.986 --> 37:31.555
No reason.

37:32.355 --> 37:34.825
<i>So, what do you want to lay down today?</i>

37:37.160 --> 37:39.062
No. No bets.

37:39.562 --> 37:43.032
I'm just going to cool it today. Thanks.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.576
<i>So why did you call me?</i>

37:50.039 --> 37:54.110
Shit. I got to go, Ivan.
I'll talk to you later.

38:03.636 --> 38:05.594
So what does that mean?

38:05.922 --> 38:09.492
It means we wait 10 hours,
figure out what the hell's happening.

38:09.592 --> 38:10.995
Babe, can we talk?

38:37.720 --> 38:41.024
Hey, Ivan. What a surprise.

38:41.124 --> 38:44.928
I was wondering why you showed up tonight,
and then it occurred to me.

38:45.028 --> 38:49.065
It's probably 'cause I called you
like a paranoid fucking idiot.

38:50.367 --> 38:54.004
Hey, Ivan. What a surprise.

38:54.937 --> 38:56.942
What are you doing?

38:58.341 --> 39:00.477
He's going to be here soon.
You can't leave me alone.

39:00.577 --> 39:04.715
Well, I'm not in the picture, so,
send me a text message when it's done?

39:05.415 --> 39:09.886
Well, I... I'm not
in the photo either, so...

39:09.986 --> 39:12.554
maybe I should leave too?

39:13.857 --> 39:16.292
- Where are you going?
- I don't know yet.

39:17.092 --> 39:19.130
Can I come?

39:22.899 --> 39:26.536
You guys are unbelievable.
Real friends you turned out to be.

39:26.936 --> 39:29.673
Well, we got to do
what's in the photo. Right, bro?

39:45.221 --> 39:47.231
Where we going?

39:47.910 --> 39:52.470
Nowhere. I don't want to abandon Jasper
in case something goes wrong.

39:58.501 --> 39:59.763
Are we okay?

40:02.772 --> 40:05.275
I got jealous. This is a...

40:05.375 --> 40:08.516
It's a very complicated situation.
You're doing your best.

40:08.616 --> 40:11.380
And I, obviously, am...

40:11.780 --> 40:13.540
I'm not handling it well.

40:22.425 --> 40:24.862
You got jealous?

40:26.396 --> 40:28.598
Tell me more.

40:35.538 --> 40:40.577
So, Ivan, I mean, what a surprise.

40:41.578 --> 40:43.992
You said that already.

40:44.092 --> 40:46.333
Oh, yeah.

40:47.216 --> 40:49.746
Can I get you something to drink?

40:52.055 --> 40:53.924
You know what I like about you, Jasper?

40:58.294 --> 40:59.930
You never welched on a bet.

41:02.165 --> 41:06.102
I have never had to send Marcus
over here to collect.

41:08.304 --> 41:10.707
And I can appreciate that.

41:11.107 --> 41:13.177
I can.

41:19.982 --> 41:22.252
Is that yours?

41:25.555 --> 41:27.924
You mind if I see it?

41:29.960 --> 41:31.992
Come on. Let me see it.

41:42.405 --> 41:43.807
That's a nice one.

41:45.208 --> 41:48.312
Yeah. That takes me back.

41:50.813 --> 41:54.331
Believe it or not,
I used to have Marcus's job.

41:54.917 --> 41:59.188
I wasn't a bad enforcer.
I had my own style.

41:59.589 --> 42:02.492
You know, I used warm-up bats.

42:02.592 --> 42:05.361
They gave me a little extra "pop."

42:05.461 --> 42:07.472
Yeah.

42:08.298 --> 42:10.288
There was this one time...

42:10.388 --> 42:12.660
God Almighty...

42:14.671 --> 42:16.339
I was supposed to "kneecap" a guy.

42:16.739 --> 42:20.343
Standard boilerplate stuff.
I'd done it a hundred times, right?

42:20.443 --> 42:24.180
Only this time, I take a swing,
I hit him... Bam!

42:24.680 --> 42:26.649
And the bat breaks.

42:26.749 --> 42:31.191
It sends a sliver of wood...
right into the guy's junk.

42:32.455 --> 42:34.958
You should have heard him.
He was screaming like a cat.

42:35.958 --> 42:38.561
I swear to God, as I heard
the paramedics take him away,

42:38.961 --> 42:42.765
they said that one of his testicles
had swollen to the size of a grapefruit.

42:42.865 --> 42:45.902
You imagine that? That pain?

42:48.899 --> 42:50.786
Messy.

42:52.275 --> 42:55.250
Messy, unfortunate work.

43:01.217 --> 43:03.715
In my position,

43:04.854 --> 43:08.892
there's only one thing worse than a guy
who can't make good on bets.

43:10.927 --> 43:13.930
And that's a guy who never loses bets.

43:19.836 --> 43:22.572
I'm just finally getting lucky, I guess.

43:24.807 --> 43:26.810
Just lucky.

43:28.010 --> 43:29.947
You guess.

43:33.783 --> 43:35.588
Listen! There's no fix, okay?

43:35.688 --> 43:38.762
- Is it an owner?
- No! I swear!

43:38.862 --> 43:40.657
Fuck, it was just a streak, okay?

43:45.041 --> 43:48.731
Look, okay, okay!
I have a source! I have a source.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.669
It's reliable.

43:53.007 --> 43:55.305
I can't explain it.

43:55.405 --> 43:57.223
It could cause some serious problems.

43:58.208 --> 44:01.577
Was it a doctor? Tell me
what they're doing to bring in the fix!

44:01.677 --> 44:04.948
No, it... It's nothing like that.

44:05.748 --> 44:08.185
Look, you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

44:10.286 --> 44:12.008
Bullshit.

44:12.422 --> 44:14.725
Can't you just ride my bets?

44:17.026 --> 44:20.564
- Yeah. Just make the same bets I do and...
- I know what "ride" means.

44:22.932 --> 44:24.735
You are such a piece of shit.

44:26.202 --> 44:29.239
I hope you enjoyed
the peep show, Jasper!

44:37.180 --> 44:39.616
I'll... take that.

44:41.584 --> 44:43.787
- Finn, this is...
- I was just leaving.

44:46.489 --> 44:48.292
So... are we good?

44:56.966 --> 44:58.907
So...

44:59.969 --> 45:03.273
- He basically knows.
- He doesn't know jack shit.

45:04.674 --> 45:08.044
Well, he knows that you have
some kind of information.

45:08.144 --> 45:11.014
I mean, how long is he going to be
content just piggybacking your bets?

45:11.914 --> 45:15.251
I don't know. Forever?

45:15.551 --> 45:17.554
I got it under control.

45:21.557 --> 45:24.594
You look like hell, Jasper.
Are you even sleeping?

45:25.194 --> 45:28.610
You know what, man? Get off my dick!

45:28.931 --> 45:34.256
You and Callie both get all this money
for doing nothing. You should be happy.

45:34.456 --> 45:37.640
We're all in this.
Callie and I are sharing the risk.

45:37.740 --> 45:42.211
I hope you have a back-up plan in case
this thing with your bookie falls through.

45:45.248 --> 45:48.951
I seem to remember you wearing something
a little different in tonight's photo.

45:49.051 --> 45:51.387
Screw you, Jasper.

45:53.656 --> 45:56.159
I'm not going to start
as long as he's here.

45:56.259 --> 45:59.529
Yeah, no, Jasper was just about
to take a walk. Aren't you?

45:59.629 --> 46:02.031
- I am?
- Yeah.

46:02.231 --> 46:06.302
Yes, don't forget to come spy
on me at 8:00.

46:17.380 --> 46:19.982
So I don't really know
what I'm doing here.

46:20.082 --> 46:22.352
You're going to have to
walk me through it.

46:24.254 --> 46:26.222
Sure.

46:26.690 --> 46:29.058
We just need to get you
in the same pose in the photo.

46:29.158 --> 46:32.696
And then I... I do the rest.

46:35.932 --> 46:37.602
You know...

46:37.702 --> 46:40.901
I'd really like to know
how you got me to do this.

46:41.792 --> 46:44.040
You and I both.

47:17.792 --> 47:19.190
What are you thinking?

47:19.290 --> 47:23.647
You're just... You're really...
You're very beautiful.

47:26.949 --> 47:28.818
Don't sound so surprised.

47:29.018 --> 47:30.822
No.

47:31.289 --> 47:36.953
No. I guess it takes a moment
like this to wake a guy up,

47:37.053 --> 47:40.329
so he can actually see
what's right in front of him.

47:54.076 --> 47:55.271
That's our cue.

48:12.962 --> 48:14.331
It's amazing.

48:15.731 --> 48:19.035
Even hazy and out of focus,

48:20.035 --> 48:23.573
you can still recognize
your own silhouette.

48:28.310 --> 48:31.347
I wondered all day... How?

48:32.247 --> 48:34.518
How is this possible?

48:37.954 --> 48:39.773
So...

48:40.273 --> 48:44.013
Marcus here is going to babysit.

48:48.197 --> 48:49.232
And you...

48:51.867 --> 48:54.004
You're going to take me
to see what's over there.

49:03.879 --> 49:07.450
I would not have believed you
if you'd told me.

49:10.052 --> 49:12.788
Kicks them out every night at 8:00.

49:12.888 --> 49:14.924
Yeah.

49:16.325 --> 49:17.994
What about the daytime ones?

49:19.228 --> 49:21.231
I don't know.

49:21.731 --> 49:24.401
Since we found it,
it's only been doing 'em at night.

49:25.501 --> 49:26.903
What's this?

49:28.637 --> 49:31.408
It's... It's the newest one.

49:32.842 --> 49:34.711
Okay.

49:35.211 --> 49:37.180
Okay.

49:37.980 --> 49:40.197
Here's the deal.

49:42.351 --> 49:44.787
Every day you're going
to take this photo.

49:44.887 --> 49:47.657
And you're going to write down the stats
that go on the window tomorrow.

49:47.757 --> 49:49.725
Marcus is gonna come by
and pick up the photo for safekeeping.

49:49.825 --> 49:53.430
- Wait... Wait a second.
- I am not going to repeat myself!

49:54.497 --> 49:56.999
The three of you are going
to sit right there,

49:57.099 --> 49:59.803
just like that on the couch
so I know you're behaving.

50:00.636 --> 50:03.239
And you tell no one about this.

50:04.539 --> 50:07.904
We wouldn't want anyone messing
with our little golden goose here?

50:09.411 --> 50:11.595
Now, would we?

50:14.517 --> 50:17.086
I want 50%.

50:25.294 --> 50:27.161
You take a zero off that number.

50:30.099 --> 50:34.003
That still makes you a very lucky man.

50:34.970 --> 50:36.868
Yeah.

50:37.644 --> 50:39.943
I feel real lucky.

50:40.542 --> 50:43.065
We didn't agree to this.

50:43.165 --> 50:47.795
- You should have talked to us, man.
- I did my best, okay?

50:48.618 --> 50:51.941
We're still going to get some money.
He's going to be making a lot of bets.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.625
It'll be fine.

50:55.725 --> 50:58.227
What happens when the guy above him
gets wise to what's going on?

50:58.327 --> 51:00.530
How many more scary motherfuckers
are gonna show up here

51:00.830 --> 51:02.265
looking for a piece of this?

51:03.499 --> 51:06.802
Ivan's smart.
He's not going to fuck this up.

51:06.902 --> 51:09.371
Oh, that's very reassuring.

51:10.527 --> 51:12.745
It's unbelievable.

51:14.643 --> 51:16.012
Where's the photo from yesterday?

51:17.580 --> 51:20.616
Wait, you're not seriously going to paint
at a time like this, are you?

51:20.716 --> 51:22.711
Yeah. I mean, what else
am I supposed to do?

51:22.811 --> 51:24.788
We obviously have no control
over what's happening.

51:26.956 --> 51:29.352
He's keeping the photos.

51:29.452 --> 51:31.727
For safekeeping.

51:32.761 --> 51:35.965
No! That is totally unacceptable.
Call him right now. Call him.

51:36.365 --> 51:38.868
Tell him we'll put up the results on
the window, but we're keeping the photo.

51:38.968 --> 51:41.036
Are you a fucking child?

51:41.536 --> 51:44.040
You're aware of who's on the other end
of this phone, right?

52:20.042 --> 52:23.412
I'm gonna make some tea, babe.
Do you want anything?

52:31.353 --> 52:34.990
You know, you were always
doing the paintings.

52:35.090 --> 52:38.027
You were just seeing
what you'd already done.

52:38.127 --> 52:41.964
I know. I'm aware of that, Callie.
That's what's so maddening.

52:42.064 --> 52:44.453
I painted them in the future.
Now I can't see the photograph,

52:44.553 --> 52:47.099
I end up not painting.

52:58.213 --> 53:00.916
- Jasper?
- What?

53:01.016 --> 53:05.187
Can't you just, like, sneak a photo
of the Polaroid when it pops up?

53:05.287 --> 53:07.590
Just grab one on the phone?

53:07.690 --> 53:09.725
Since you don't see the picture today,

53:09.825 --> 53:13.062
there won't be a painting
for me to photograph tomorrow.

53:13.362 --> 53:17.367
There will be, if you agree
to take the fuckin' photograph.

53:18.867 --> 53:23.172
Look, man, I mean... If your decisions
are gonna continue to dictate my future,

53:23.272 --> 53:26.661
can you at least make one
that benefits me?

53:27.309 --> 53:30.312
And risk my neck being broken
just 'cause you can't find your mojo?

53:31.112 --> 53:34.650
Fuck that. Can't you just
be happy with the money?

53:34.750 --> 53:37.820
No. I can't, Jasper.
I don't give a shit about the money.

53:37.920 --> 53:39.555
At this point,
I'd rather call the police,

53:39.655 --> 53:42.525
or fill a bucket of water and spill it
all over your precious machine.

53:43.692 --> 53:45.829
Is that a fuckin' threat?

53:47.863 --> 53:51.834
No, it's not.
But you can't ignore the fact that...

53:51.934 --> 53:54.170
some of us aren't making out
on this deal very well.

53:58.540 --> 53:59.843
I'll see what I can do.

55:28.864 --> 55:31.166
There's a painting. Thank the Lord.

55:31.266 --> 55:33.536
How about thank the Jasper?

55:36.471 --> 55:39.541
- What now?
- Oh, it's just it's kind of strange.

55:39.641 --> 55:42.077
Doesn't look like something
I would normally paint.

55:42.177 --> 55:46.982
It looks like you did it in a hurry.
See? That paint's still dripping.

55:47.582 --> 55:50.819
- Maybe it's a warning.
- About what?

55:53.789 --> 55:56.759
Maybe something bad's about to happen.

55:57.276 --> 55:59.595
You're sending us a warning. Look.

55:59.895 --> 56:04.066
We look scared, right?
And I'm staring up at that painting.

56:04.666 --> 56:06.802
I'm trying to tell myself something.

56:07.202 --> 56:12.041
I mean, we don't look happy,
but the situation isn't exactly ideal.

56:12.883 --> 56:17.679
No. You said it yourself, Finn.
That's not something you'd normally paint.

56:17.779 --> 56:20.182
Yeah, but art's weird, man. I'm just...

56:20.282 --> 56:23.285
I'm glad that there's something
on the canvas.

56:24.720 --> 56:27.689
Just relax, Jasper.

56:36.565 --> 56:39.268
What if Jasper is right?

56:39.368 --> 56:42.504
What if something terrible
is gonna happen tomorrow?

56:42.604 --> 56:44.974
Then we wouldn't be in the photo, right?

56:45.074 --> 56:47.409
We'd have left.

56:47.509 --> 56:49.178
Okay. Why don't we?

56:50.479 --> 56:55.284
- What, leave?
- Yeah. We can pack our bags and just go.

56:56.585 --> 56:59.669
Well, and what? Just...

57:00.381 --> 57:04.125
leave Jasper to deal
with everything on his own?

57:04.572 --> 57:06.395
He wouldn't care. He'd be fine.

57:07.596 --> 57:09.464
That machine over there, I mean...

57:09.564 --> 57:13.669
We can't just walk away from it when
there's still hope for things to work out.

57:13.769 --> 57:16.733
I don't see why we'd do that.

57:20.175 --> 57:23.212
Okay. I trust you.

57:23.312 --> 57:28.253
Besides, you have to admit,
this machine, it's working magic on you.

57:28.683 --> 57:31.621
What can I say? I like being a muse.

59:21.997 --> 59:23.832
Bye.

59:33.508 --> 59:35.577
Hey, Joe.

59:36.970 --> 59:40.516
- You on duty tonight?
- Actually, yesterday was my last shift,

59:40.616 --> 59:43.605
so I'm just dropping off the keys.

59:44.819 --> 59:48.123
- Last shift?
- Yeah, man. Movin' up to the big time.

59:48.323 --> 59:49.646
Oh, shit.

59:49.746 --> 59:53.529
Congratulations. That's great. Awesome.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:02.404
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Yep.

01:00:02.504 --> 01:00:04.740
Oh, oh, hey.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.810
Let me give you one of my cards.

01:00:13.314 --> 01:00:15.519
Let's have a drink sometime.

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.453
Yeah.

01:00:18.253 --> 01:00:20.923
- Stay in touch, man.
- You too, Joe.

01:00:21.023 --> 01:00:22.918
Yeah.

01:00:45.567 --> 01:00:47.016
What's wrong?

01:00:47.903 --> 01:00:49.618
Marcus just caught me
talking to Big Joe.

01:00:49.718 --> 01:00:51.687
- What the fuck happened?
- Well, nothing happened.

01:00:51.787 --> 01:00:53.956
It's just... It's Big Joe's last night,
so he gives me his card.

01:00:54.056 --> 01:00:56.958
- What did Marcus do?
- He made a phone call. He drove off.

01:00:57.458 --> 01:01:00.729
Motherfucking shit fuck!

01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:03.815
Well, wait. Can't we just tell them
it wasn't anything?

01:01:03.915 --> 01:01:06.468
No, 'cause he's not gonna believe us.

01:01:07.068 --> 01:01:11.106
All right. It's okay. It's okay
because I fucking planned for this.

01:01:11.206 --> 01:01:14.009
- I hid weapons around the house.
- Wait, what?

01:01:14.209 --> 01:01:17.747
Only because you made
that fucking skull painting, okay?

01:01:19.914 --> 01:01:22.485
You have to make that painting
before the camera goes off.

01:01:23.919 --> 01:01:25.587
Make the fucking painting!

01:01:25.887 --> 01:01:29.758
Okay. I'm sorry.
You hid weapons in our house?

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:32.685
- Yes, I hid weapons in our fucking house.
- Why did you hide weapons?

01:01:32.885 --> 01:01:34.673
Do you know who the fuck
these people are?

01:01:34.773 --> 01:01:38.667
- What exactly did you hide?
- Just sit still and calm down.

01:01:38.767 --> 01:01:42.538
- No, I'm very worried about this.
- Just sit still and calm down!

01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:48.243
What happens after the picture
gets taken?

01:01:48.343 --> 01:01:51.413
- We wait.
- We just sit here and wait?

01:01:51.513 --> 01:01:55.651
They'll come in, ask us some questions.

01:01:56.251 --> 01:02:00.255
And if it goes well, that'll be that.

01:02:01.389 --> 01:02:03.959
What if it doesn't go well?

01:02:06.061 --> 01:02:08.127
Finn?

01:02:08.797 --> 01:02:11.500
There's a hammer under the couch.

01:02:50.805 --> 01:02:54.210
He was just the building's rent-a-cop.

01:02:57.012 --> 01:02:59.715
Then why is this
a police officer's card?

01:03:00.915 --> 01:03:02.882
Well, he just became one. All right?

01:03:02.982 --> 01:03:05.220
He was dropping off his keys.
It was his last shift.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.840
I didn't tell him anything about you
or the machine, so...

01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:14.629
I would love to believe that.

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:38.888
Unfortunately,

01:03:39.588 --> 01:03:40.604
I...

01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:45.050
can't afford to trust you.

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:50.522
What... What's he looking for?

01:03:52.364 --> 01:03:54.389
Maybe I can help?

01:03:55.303 --> 01:03:56.772
She's your girlfriend, yes?

01:04:01.843 --> 01:04:03.744
Yes,

01:04:03.844 --> 01:04:05.494
maybe you can help.

01:04:14.222 --> 01:04:16.258
Okay.

01:04:17.125 --> 01:04:19.528
Now let's see if we can
remember anything new.

01:04:22.619 --> 01:04:24.250
I see you.

01:04:24.699 --> 01:04:27.644
Boyfriend. Adrenaline.

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:30.939
Mind racing.

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:33.576
Trust me. You're not fast enough.

01:04:34.709 --> 01:04:37.462
There is an easy way out of this,

01:04:37.562 --> 01:04:40.215
and that's just to answer
my fuckin' questions.

01:04:40.315 --> 01:04:42.818
- Please don't!
- You're gonna die.

01:04:44.819 --> 01:04:47.456
Why do I feel a total lack of concern?

01:04:48.256 --> 01:04:50.192
Because you haven't seen
tomorrow's photo yet.

01:04:53.094 --> 01:04:54.463
It shows your murder.

01:05:01.002 --> 01:05:03.672
And who kills me? You?

01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:06.342
He does.

01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:13.114
Maybe it's for the money.

01:05:13.914 --> 01:05:16.951
You must have a fortune
in winnings already.

01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:51.019
Keys.

01:06:10.371 --> 01:06:12.307
You should slide your chair
over this way.

01:06:16.244 --> 01:06:20.008
I'm serious. Once he sees that photo,

01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:22.484
he's gonna aim through that window
and shoot you in the back.

01:06:41.536 --> 01:06:43.706
Smart move.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.329
Where's Jasper?

01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:10.332
Marcus, where's Jasp...

01:07:13.334 --> 01:07:15.604
Where is he?

01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:24.079
Jasper, fuckin' stop!

01:07:41.429 --> 01:07:45.133
Hello? Hi, Mrs. Anderson.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.972
No, it was Callie. She...
She burned her hand on the stove.

01:07:50.772 --> 01:07:52.225
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:07:52.925 --> 01:07:56.078
Thank you. Bye now.

01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:12.828
Okay.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.336
Oh, God.

01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:28.644
- Okay.
- Okay. Got it.

01:08:45.893 --> 01:08:48.129
We can't leave them in here
forever, you know.

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:51.667
No shit. It's just for now.

01:08:54.335 --> 01:08:57.805
- All right. What's next?
- Next?

01:08:57.906 --> 01:09:00.908
Next I go get my money from Ivan's.

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:13.020
Thank you for cleaning up
the living room.

01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:14.889
You mean the blood?

01:09:14.988 --> 01:09:18.593
Thank you for cleaning up the blood
that could have been mine?

01:09:18.693 --> 01:09:20.694
You're welcome.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:22.964
- Babe...
- Don't!

01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:26.602
- I'm just trying to make sure you're okay.
- Do I look okay?

01:09:29.237 --> 01:09:32.474
- What can I do?
- Why don't you go paint?

01:09:44.786 --> 01:09:46.654
Holy hell.

01:09:46.754 --> 01:09:48.790
I know, right?

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:51.658
And this is just the start.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.694
Jasper.

01:09:54.194 --> 01:09:56.498
I think... I think we should leave.

01:09:57.599 --> 01:09:59.701
Split the money, get out of the country,

01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:01.770
get on the other side of it,
get away from the machine.

01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:04.405
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:07.108
The safest place on Earth is right here.

01:10:07.846 --> 01:10:10.311
As long as we see ourselves
in that photo every day,

01:10:10.411 --> 01:10:12.014
we know we're alive tomorrow.

01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:17.070
- Callie and I, we...
- We what?

01:10:18.152 --> 01:10:20.054
You know.

01:10:20.154 --> 01:10:22.857
All I know is that Jasper
saved my life tonight.

01:10:23.771 --> 01:10:24.893
I'm going to bed.

01:10:24.993 --> 01:10:28.072
Jasper, can you give me
something to sleep?

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.436
Thank you.

01:10:38.406 --> 01:10:40.375
Callie.

01:10:41.276 --> 01:10:43.811
Callie. Callie!

01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:26.521
Hello. I'm Dr. Heidecker.
Forgive the hour and my appearance.

01:11:26.621 --> 01:11:29.157
Well, how can I help you?

01:11:29.257 --> 01:11:32.560
Henry Bezzerides is a colleague of mine.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.464
Does he live in the apartment
across the way?

01:11:36.797 --> 01:11:39.920
Yeah. Yes, he does.

01:11:41.035 --> 01:11:44.005
I knocked. There was no answer.

01:11:44.105 --> 01:11:46.174
What's going on?

01:11:46.274 --> 01:11:48.876
A Dr. Hei... Heidecker is here.

01:11:48.976 --> 01:11:51.445
She's looking for Mr. Bezzerides.

01:11:51.545 --> 01:11:54.882
Did you tell her that he moved out
a couple months ago?

01:11:57.285 --> 01:12:02.790
Did he give you his hat before he left?

01:12:07.996 --> 01:12:10.328
So we... we found his journal,

01:12:10.428 --> 01:12:14.268
and from what we've read,
I guess he saw something bad.

01:12:14.368 --> 01:12:18.073
- I know. I know. He sent me a letter.
- He tried to change it.

01:12:18.673 --> 01:12:21.643
After Henry retired,
he kept me up on his experiments.

01:12:22.143 --> 01:12:25.647
To be honest, I didn't think
they'd amount to much.

01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:29.384
- Poor Henry.
- Yep.

01:12:30.473 --> 01:12:32.553
Don't fuck with time.

01:12:33.654 --> 01:12:37.258
Well... you think time did this?

01:12:37.358 --> 01:12:40.162
That he was somehow punished
for trying to change the future?

01:12:41.496 --> 01:12:43.998
Well, what else would do that
to someone?

01:12:44.598 --> 01:12:47.769
Thorium gas would be my first guess.
You see the coil over there?

01:12:47.869 --> 01:12:51.106
I'm guessing he was stretching for it
up on that shelf there

01:12:51.206 --> 01:12:54.576
when he knocked over the canister.

01:12:55.176 --> 01:12:59.013
It's just an accident, his death.
That's all. Nothing more.

01:12:59.814 --> 01:13:02.074
I suspect...

01:13:02.174 --> 01:13:04.752
he was panicked
whilst in the process of...

01:13:05.052 --> 01:13:08.791
trying to... avoid this.

01:13:11.626 --> 01:13:16.464
You see his hat on the couch and what
looks like his blood on the window?

01:13:16.564 --> 01:13:19.029
It seems that he met
an unpleasant end, but...

01:13:19.129 --> 01:13:22.871
clearly this photograph,
which takes place tomorrow...

01:13:24.072 --> 01:13:28.109
had nothing to do with him at all.
Oh, it's ironic.

01:13:28.509 --> 01:13:30.445
Tomorrow?

01:13:30.545 --> 01:13:33.560
How could he have taken the photo when the
camera only shoots one day ahead of time?

01:13:34.749 --> 01:13:39.170
Why, I don't know where you're getting
your data, but I believe you're mistaken.

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:40.989
This letter's postmarked a week ago,

01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:44.225
so he had to have taken the photo
at least that far in advance.

01:13:44.325 --> 01:13:46.628
A week? How could he have...
how could he have mailed the photo?

01:13:47.028 --> 01:13:50.064
You're telling me you can shoot
a photo whenever you want?

01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:53.701
No. I don't know about
"whenever you want."

01:13:54.102 --> 01:13:56.804
Evidently, Henry had moved
past the initial tests

01:13:56.904 --> 01:13:58.840
and had got it to look further.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:02.010
Do you think you could
change the settings?

01:14:04.512 --> 01:14:06.480
No.

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:10.118
Henry shared his results with me,
but not his methods.

01:14:11.385 --> 01:14:14.422
I don't know any more
about the controls than you do.

01:14:14.822 --> 01:14:16.758
That's too bad.

01:14:55.363 --> 01:14:57.331
That lady didn't mean us any harm.

01:14:58.131 --> 01:15:00.298
What about the gun in her hand?

01:15:00.398 --> 01:15:02.970
She wasn't going to use it.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.539
You don't fucking know that, okay?

01:15:04.939 --> 01:15:08.623
And if I didn't act, then Callie
would be waking up to our dead bodies!

01:15:08.723 --> 01:15:10.913
At the very least,
the police would have shown up.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:18.419
Sounds like Jasper
was just trying to protect us.

01:15:18.619 --> 01:15:20.589
Well, you were not there.

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:38.306
Ready for your big moment?

01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:39.735
Hell, yes.

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:42.537
Do you want me to go over there
and make sure you've got it right?

01:15:44.823 --> 01:15:46.704
Yeah.

01:16:40.835 --> 01:16:42.570
What's tomorrow's look like?

01:17:01.956 --> 01:17:04.169
Hey, Callie?

01:17:13.146 --> 01:17:15.690
Is that tomorrow's photo?

01:17:17.505 --> 01:17:18.907
Well, fine. I don't want to see it.

01:17:19.007 --> 01:17:21.909
Can we please... pack one
of your bags and let's leave?

01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:24.801
You're not going anywhere.

01:17:25.212 --> 01:17:27.502
Did you not hear Dr. Heidecker?

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:30.418
She said it was an accident,
so that means things can change.

01:17:30.918 --> 01:17:33.654
And I think I'm going to take my chances
with that, so please, come on.

01:17:34.293 --> 01:17:36.357
Go ahead.

01:17:36.457 --> 01:17:38.526
Commit suicide.

01:17:38.626 --> 01:17:40.628
But don't kill your girlfriend
in the process.

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:44.531
What...

01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:45.867
You're in the photo?

01:17:48.302 --> 01:17:51.906
- Okay, fine. Let me see it.
- No.

01:17:58.345 --> 01:18:01.279
Oh, rip the Band-Aid off already.

01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:33.014
How's she doing? What is she doing?

01:18:33.614 --> 01:18:35.845
She's passed out.

01:18:36.517 --> 01:18:38.853
She was distraught.

01:18:38.953 --> 01:18:43.324
I gave her something...
to take the edge off.

01:18:44.825 --> 01:18:47.261
Oh, man.

01:18:47.928 --> 01:18:50.965
It was so good when it was good.

01:18:53.233 --> 01:18:56.237
We had such a cool relationship.

01:18:57.538 --> 01:19:01.736
- Sorry, man.
- Oh, it's not your fault. It's my fault.

01:19:04.111 --> 01:19:06.881
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19:08.015 --> 01:19:09.851
I got this a year ago.

01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:14.756
And I couldn't pull the trigger.

01:19:15.956 --> 01:19:20.161
- Why's that?
- You were right. I was scared.

01:19:21.061 --> 01:19:22.882
Coward.

01:19:23.331 --> 01:19:26.834
I mean, I'm not a painter.
I'm a glorified janitor.

01:19:26.934 --> 01:19:29.203
And she deserves more than that.

01:19:29.303 --> 01:19:32.173
I mean, I wanted to be more than that.

01:19:33.841 --> 01:19:36.510
- I get it.
- No.

01:19:37.011 --> 01:19:38.860
No.

01:19:39.113 --> 01:19:43.117
I've been blaming you
in my head for all of this.

01:19:43.417 --> 01:19:47.992
And who knows? Maybe it was me
that was making the decisions, secretly.

01:19:48.889 --> 01:19:51.474
You know, just...

01:19:52.293 --> 01:19:55.862
sabotaging everything out of fear.

01:19:58.799 --> 01:20:01.802
Maybe there's a way to fix this still.

01:20:01.902 --> 01:20:04.456
- I think it's too late.
- Yeah.

01:20:25.626 --> 01:20:26.815
You know,

01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:30.647
I'm actually starting
to like that smell.

01:20:30.847 --> 01:20:33.801
I mean, how fucked up is that?

01:20:42.776 --> 01:20:46.814
When I saw the suitcase,
I knew you'd left the program.

01:20:49.016 --> 01:20:53.421
And I don't give a fuck
what Dr. Heiden-schmeiden says.

01:20:58.626 --> 01:21:01.929
You don't fuck with time.

01:21:07.834 --> 01:21:11.205
I need you alive at least one more day.

01:21:11.905 --> 01:21:15.042
If I have to drug you
and put you on that sofa myself,

01:21:15.242 --> 01:21:16.945
so help me, I will.

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.615
Here.

01:21:23.817 --> 01:21:26.287
That should keep you warm.

01:21:26.987 --> 01:21:28.823
All right.

01:22:31.451 --> 01:22:33.655
Oh, God.

01:22:34.922 --> 01:22:36.957
Help!

01:22:37.324 --> 01:22:39.827
Help me! Somebody help me!

01:22:39.927 --> 01:22:41.918
Okay.

01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:49.470
The gun.

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:52.206
Goddamn it, Jasper.

01:23:21.301 --> 01:23:23.437
I paint this today,

01:23:24.037 --> 01:23:26.779
but you saw it two weeks ago.

01:23:29.176 --> 01:23:31.413
Did I send you down here?

01:23:35.816 --> 01:23:38.385
Why would I do that?

01:23:52.466 --> 01:23:54.436
Thank you.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.296
Who the fuck is this?

01:24:58.598 --> 01:25:00.200
You motherfucker!

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.137
Don't you dare! I'll fucking
kill you and wear your skin!

01:25:04.304 --> 01:25:08.075
<i>Well, if you do that,
the bucket's gonna fall.</i>

01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:14.315
<i>Get Callie and give her the phone.</i>

01:25:35.769 --> 01:25:37.238
<i>Stop pushing me.</i>

01:25:41.008 --> 01:25:42.543
<i>Take it.</i>

01:25:43.143 --> 01:25:46.185
- Callie, can you see me?
- <i>Hello?</i>

01:25:46.646 --> 01:25:49.584
<i>Jasper knocked me out last night,
and he locked me in the storage unit.</i>

01:25:51.418 --> 01:25:54.055
- What?
- He's going to kill you.

01:25:55.555 --> 01:25:58.359
No, he would never...

01:25:59.493 --> 01:26:01.577
Give me the phone.

01:26:04.398 --> 01:26:05.966
If you don't put that bucket down,

01:26:06.066 --> 01:26:08.051
I'm gonna blow her brains
all over this fucking window!

01:26:09.102 --> 01:26:10.904
<i>You're gonna kill us anyway.</i>

01:26:11.004 --> 01:26:13.875
<i>You're gonna kill me
if I put the bucket down or not.</i>

01:26:15.375 --> 01:26:16.944
<i>There's only one way out of this.</i>

01:26:17.244 --> 01:26:20.667
We walk away. If we walk away,
you get to keep your machine.

01:26:27.721 --> 01:26:30.757
<i>Hurry up! This bucket is getting heavy!</i>

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.003
Give Callie the phone.

01:26:48.041 --> 01:26:49.323
<i>Callie...</i>

01:26:49.723 --> 01:26:53.463
I want you to look
in Jasper's hoodie pocket.

01:26:53.563 --> 01:26:57.885
<i>He has something of yours,
something I got a long time ago.</i>

01:27:07.694 --> 01:27:08.996
I'm sorry.

01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:11.799
<i>I'm sorry that I haven't
been there for you.</i>

01:27:11.899 --> 01:27:15.036
It's okay. You are now.

01:27:16.169 --> 01:27:17.399
Take the gun.

01:27:17.867 --> 01:27:20.407
<i>Take it away from Jasper.</i>

01:27:22.009 --> 01:27:24.066
Give me the gun.

01:27:25.545 --> 01:27:26.980
Give me the gun.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.462
Give it to me.

01:27:32.452 --> 01:27:34.855
Now back up.

01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:37.324
<i>Over there.</i>

01:27:44.397 --> 01:27:46.900
Whatever you say.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.070
- <i>I'll be there in 30 seconds.</i>
- Okay.

01:28:07.854 --> 01:28:09.907
Hang on.

01:28:12.893 --> 01:28:14.228
Goddamn it.

01:28:17.831 --> 01:28:19.918
Pack. Quickly.

01:28:21.902 --> 01:28:24.772
You know what? Maybe this'll
keep you warm at night.

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:30.981
- Where will you go?
- Far.

01:28:32.179 --> 01:28:33.881
We're going to need some of this.

01:28:34.887 --> 01:28:37.714
- Take as much as you want.
- Yeah, you could always make more, right?

01:28:37.914 --> 01:28:39.420
Don't forget your ring.

01:29:18.825 --> 01:29:22.037
Oh, my God. I really killed him.

01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:25.517
- You had no choice.
- Hey.

01:29:25.865 --> 01:29:28.468
Come sit down. Are you okay?

01:29:29.743 --> 01:29:33.807
- I'm going to get you some ice.
- Okay, but we need to go.

01:29:35.145 --> 01:29:37.200
Oh, my God.

01:29:41.014 --> 01:29:44.284
Look. The photo... it changed!

01:29:44.384 --> 01:29:46.970
Oh, thank God.

01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:49.723
When I saw that photo
of you two together...

01:29:49.823 --> 01:29:51.792
No, it's okay.

01:29:51.892 --> 01:29:55.863
I just didn't think I'd be able to change
anything if Dr. Heidecker's letter didn't...

01:29:57.297 --> 01:29:59.533
Oh, shit.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.899
I need to paint this.

01:30:10.677 --> 01:30:12.880
I... I don't understand.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.544
I paint this for Mr. "B", so I'd...

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:19.389
be able to use his keys
to get out of the storage unit.

01:30:19.489 --> 01:30:21.788
It doesn't matter.
I'll tell you when we leave.

01:30:21.888 --> 01:30:25.459
- We need to go before the cops show up.
- Okay, I'm going to get you that ice.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.170
This isn't... possible.

01:31:10.637 --> 01:31:13.840
I was always going to paint this?

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.677
We haven't changed anything.

01:31:18.231 --> 01:31:20.947
Then where did this come from?

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.596
- I thought you were getting ice.
- I was. I am.

01:31:39.567 --> 01:31:41.933
What were you saying?

01:31:45.563 --> 01:31:47.365
Doesn't matter.

01:31:47.974 --> 01:31:50.277
Here. You should probably go lay down,

01:31:50.377 --> 01:31:52.946
put this ice on your head.

01:32:35.688 --> 01:32:36.838
What the fuck was that?

01:32:38.525 --> 01:32:40.393
The camera just went off!

01:32:40.693 --> 01:32:42.864
What? Give... Give me this.

01:32:46.499 --> 01:32:48.818
I can explain.

01:32:51.571 --> 01:32:53.411
No.

01:32:59.011 --> 01:33:01.315
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:33:02.015 --> 01:33:03.500
Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.101
- Look, let's just go sit down.
- No. Talk!

01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:12.025
Okay.

01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:17.964
Remember when we got the call
that Mr. "B" was behind on his rent,

01:33:18.064 --> 01:33:20.027
and I went to check on him?

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:22.403
Hey, Mr. Bezzerides, are you home?

01:33:25.605 --> 01:33:29.643
I found the machine, and sticking
out of the camera was a photo.

01:33:35.048 --> 01:33:38.017
The reason there are nighttime
and daytime photos

01:33:38.117 --> 01:33:39.937
on the wall of Mr. B's apartment

01:33:40.387 --> 01:33:46.126
is because the camera takes a photo
at 8:00 pm and 8:00 am.

01:33:46.226 --> 01:33:48.228
By keeping you and Jasper
from knowing that,

01:33:48.328 --> 01:33:51.298
I could secretly pass messages
back to myself.

01:33:53.265 --> 01:33:55.558
You're up early.

01:33:58.638 --> 01:34:01.075
So when I caught you
in the kitchen just now,

01:34:02.976 --> 01:34:05.229
what... what were you doing?

01:34:10.049 --> 01:34:12.421
I was hiding this.

01:34:16.666 --> 01:34:19.132
Last night when Jasper posed
with all of the money,

01:34:19.232 --> 01:34:21.595
I switched out the photos.

01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:29.236
I switched them back just now.

01:34:32.871 --> 01:34:36.542
I've seen all of the nighttime photos,
and Jasper's dead, so...

01:34:36.924 --> 01:34:39.411
when was this taken?

01:34:40.447 --> 01:34:42.383
It's from before.

01:34:44.150 --> 01:34:45.486
Before when?

01:34:46.353 --> 01:34:48.270
Before before.

01:34:54.761 --> 01:34:57.297
A month ago, drunk charades?

01:34:57.497 --> 01:35:02.302
Look, it didn't mean anything.
I was just acting out.

01:35:02.402 --> 01:35:05.272
I'd get drunk sometimes, and...

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:14.098
Look, it was almost as if I wanted
to get caught, so you would wake up.

01:35:15.782 --> 01:35:18.118
That's an excuse. Yeah.

01:35:18.508 --> 01:35:20.320
I'm sorry for being so weak.

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.791
I just I can't...
I can't believe that you would...

01:35:26.659 --> 01:35:31.264
allow this... you had every opportunity
to prevent it, to warn us about it.

01:35:31.364 --> 01:35:34.200
Why didn't you do that?

01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:37.003
I was just doing
what the photos told me to.

01:35:37.103 --> 01:35:40.305
I was getting pulled along,
like we all were.

01:35:40.673 --> 01:35:44.011
And don't you see?
Everything happened for a reason.

01:35:44.111 --> 01:35:47.994
Look, everything we had before
was fading. You were so distant.

01:35:48.094 --> 01:35:52.686
But then you got jealous
for the first time in ages.

01:35:59.525 --> 01:36:03.196
And I finally got to feel
your kiss again.

01:36:06.899 --> 01:36:09.469
And you said it... it takes a moment
like this to wake a guy up...

01:36:09.569 --> 01:36:12.384
to what's right in front of him.

01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:18.511
Little by little,
we were coming back together.

01:36:19.619 --> 01:36:20.848
But then...

01:36:25.151 --> 01:36:30.134
You kept picking the machine
and your work over us.

01:36:30.234 --> 01:36:32.826
So I had to do something
to bring you back to your senses.

01:36:44.904 --> 01:36:46.631
And then today,

01:36:47.424 --> 01:36:52.112
you fought for us... harder than
I've ever seen you fight for anything.

01:36:55.355 --> 01:36:58.652
So in the end, everything worked out.

01:37:06.192 --> 01:37:07.628
Everything worked out?

01:37:20.773 --> 01:37:21.777
What are you doing?

01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:23.228
I'm going to do what we should
have done from the start.

01:37:23.328 --> 01:37:24.699
I'm going to destroy
that fucking machine.

01:37:24.799 --> 01:37:28.214
Stop! Please, stop.
You said we can change things, right?

01:37:28.714 --> 01:37:32.452
Then all I have to do is put a new note
in the window for tonight's picture.

01:37:32.852 --> 01:37:35.104
Then when I get the message last night,

01:37:35.204 --> 01:37:38.858
I'll know to prevent you
from catching me at the window just now.

01:37:38.958 --> 01:37:43.063
You'll never find the photos.
We'll never have had this conversation.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.544
If you destroy the machine,
I can't fix this.

01:38:09.822 --> 01:38:12.791
I wish you hadn't made me do that.

01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:15.862
It's going to be okay.

01:38:15.962 --> 01:38:18.998
We won't remember any of this tomorrow.

01:38:19.098 --> 01:38:21.401
It's going to be okay.

01:39:02.075 --> 01:39:03.943
What are you doing here, Joe?

01:39:04.043 --> 01:39:06.145
I got a message from Finn.

01:39:06.845 --> 01:39:09.015
He said that you two were leaving town.

01:39:09.615 --> 01:39:12.653
I might be interested to see
what Jasper was up to.

01:39:15.621 --> 01:39:18.109
What's on the window?

01:39:22.779 --> 01:39:23.944
Can I come in?

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:36.342
Sure. Fine.

01:39:36.442 --> 01:39:38.845
It doesn't matter.

01:39:38.945 --> 01:39:41.565
Tonight none of this will matter.

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.691
I guess you might have
some questions for me?
