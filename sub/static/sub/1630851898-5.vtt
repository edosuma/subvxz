00:05.000 --> 00:06.800
How am I feeling? I'm a bit stressed.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.120
It's like, I never get stage anxiety.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.800
But because this is a new format,
new concept,

00:11.880 --> 00:14.520
new for me, stand-up comedy, like…

00:14.720 --> 00:17.640
compelled to be funny,
make sure the jokes land.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.320
There's like, high pressure.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.600
And I know that Sumukhi and Sapan have
worked really hard with me.

00:22.760 --> 00:24.520
I feel obligated to perform for them.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.880
More than anything else.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.760
I'm just afraid that I'll crack a joke
and no one will laugh.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.880
What am I afraid of?
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.560
Hi, I'm your host and

01:08.640 --> 01:10.720
part-time sleep enthusiast, Sapan Verma.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.520
And on today's episode, we have

01:12.560 --> 01:14.920
the ever so charming
and disarmingly honest

01:15.000 --> 01:15.800
Karan Johar.

01:15.880 --> 01:18.920
And bringing out his funny side
is a comedian, writer,

01:19.040 --> 01:21.280
and everyone's favorite
on-screen stalker,

01:21.360 --> 01:22.280
Sumukhi Suresh.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.040
Good evening, guys!
I know you guys are like, "Wow!

01:24.120 --> 01:26.360
Sumukhi's dressed as Badshah today. Wow!"

01:27.080 --> 01:29.160
It's your boy Badshah!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.960
You guys are not allowed
to carry your bags, no?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.000
Look at the girls, they're like…

01:37.160 --> 01:38.800
Girls carry huge bags.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.200
Just giant bags.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.040
Like my bag, you should see,
it's bigger than me.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.600
And it's out of choice.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.920
I look for plus-size bags also.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.040
The reason I do that is
not because we're only shallow.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.000
Because we are.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.640
Even the small-bag girls.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.040
I'm very sure that small-bag girl
has a big bag in the car.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.760
Where she's like, "Small bag,
take it from the big bag, come…"

02:02.120 --> 02:03.920
We don't casually fling it around.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.520
We just hold onto it like this.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.800
The other thing big bags do
is that it hides something

02:09.880 --> 02:12.080
that just breaks the illusion
of a lot of things.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.360
See, you have big boobs, cool!

02:13.960 --> 02:14.880
You have a big ass, fine.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.600
Everyone's like "Wow, wow, wow!
Sexual, sexual, sexual!"

02:18.000 --> 02:19.320
But if you have a tummy, no!

02:20.240 --> 02:22.600
Because tummy breaks the illusion
of the fact that you're eating.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.160
And nobody wants to know that
you're eating.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.680
This is across sizes.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.960
Even if you have this one tiny…

02:29.160 --> 02:31.160
These thin people go saying,
"I have such a tummy…"

02:31.280 --> 02:32.840
I say, "I'll freaking slap you!"

02:34.560 --> 02:35.840
Even before going to restaurants,

02:35.880 --> 02:37.440
the first thing I check is not the menu.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.600
First thing I check is
"Do you have cushions?"

02:40.280 --> 02:41.280
And house parties…

02:41.360 --> 02:42.440
See, house parties is…

02:43.080 --> 02:44.760
for anxious people, whatever, whatever.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.440
You guys have your own shit going on.
God freaking knows.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.760
I'm very extrovert, man.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.160
So, I want to go also,
but I also have a tummy,

02:49.240 --> 02:50.200
so how to do this?

02:50.800 --> 02:52.840
So, I can't call them and be like,
"What kind of furniture do you have?"

02:54.000 --> 02:56.120
Especially this skinny-people furniture
is very skinny-people furniture.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.000
It's very like…

02:58.240 --> 03:01.200
Or they're like, "I'm sitting on
top of this, and what about that?"

03:02.120 --> 03:04.800
And I am just waiting,
and entering, I come early,

03:04.880 --> 03:08.480
so that the couch is empty
and I can take that

03:08.560 --> 03:09.840
cushion and just sit here.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.040
And my freaking luck, I'll go and
the thinnest bitch will be sitting there.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.120
Holding that cushion, she's like,
"I'm so comfortable."

03:17.200 --> 03:18.280
I'm like, "Of course, you are!

03:19.320 --> 03:21.280
You've got those biscuit abs
going on for yourself!"

03:26.440 --> 03:28.880
I wanna ask you, how many of
you guys are into casual sex here?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.680
See, it's one of those questions.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.720
Where they're like, "Sister, it's casual,

03:33.800 --> 03:35.640
which is why we're not talking about it."

03:37.200 --> 03:38.480
No, this casual sex is a huge thing, no?

03:38.560 --> 03:41.120
'Cause everyone is telling me,
"Sumukhi, after breakup, try casual."

03:41.560 --> 03:43.800
I said, "Why the hell are they
trying casual sex in India?"

03:43.880 --> 03:46.160
And why are girls behaving
like they're okay with casual?

03:46.240 --> 03:48.320
You know you've been trained
to look for <i>Sindoor.</i>

03:48.520 --> 03:49.600
Freaking look for it.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.160
We're not able to manage
the bag being down,

03:58.240 --> 03:59.880
you think we'll be managing casual?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.200
These girls are like, "No, I'm fine.
He can sleep with other girls."

04:04.280 --> 04:05.720
Sister, please look into your eyes.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.160
You will see,
you are irritated with him.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.200
And these boys also-- Come on!

04:11.400 --> 04:12.200
Come on!

04:12.560 --> 04:15.960
Boys can't even handle
a multi-cuisine order at a restaurant…

04:17.400 --> 04:19.240
if you tell them to order.
Yeah!

04:21.560 --> 04:22.720
At restaurants, they go, they're like,

04:22.800 --> 04:23.880
"Oh, no! There are
five Paneer dishes, bro.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.760
-What do you wanna order?'"
-"Bro, you order."

04:25.800 --> 04:27.600
-"But what do you…"
-"Please, you order, bro."

04:27.680 --> 04:29.240
-"Bro, Paneer…"
-"Bro, just do it."

04:34.560 --> 04:37.520
They can't differentiate
two Paneer dishes.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.320
How will you get these
idiots to do casual?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.080
Just tell them, "I'll sleep
with you for five days.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.480
If I don't see <i>Sindoor</i> after that,
I'll call your mom."

04:50.480 --> 04:52.520
Actually, that's all I wanted to say.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.360
This is just a PSA.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.920
Girls, stop trying to be casual
'cause you can't do it.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.880
Boys, just come on.
Accept the ultimatum.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.560
Because you're also getting that thing.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.120
Boys are also trained to think like,

05:02.200 --> 05:04.520
"She'll push me in a corner.
Then she'll get me married."

05:04.600 --> 05:06.120
And then they'll do
what they like the most.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.040
Complain.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.720
After they get married, they're like,

05:09.800 --> 05:11.880
"Marriage is a trap that a girl sets.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.360
Marriage is a trap.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.560
After that,
the girl goes clap, clap, clap."

05:17.000 --> 05:18.240
That's my time, guys.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.720
Thank you so much!
You guys have been a lovely audience.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.800
-Thank you so much for doing this.
-Oh, God!

05:32.440 --> 05:35.480
Did I just put myself into
lots of trouble by saying yes?

05:35.560 --> 05:36.840
-Always.
-Always.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.480
I always do that. I always do.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.280
I don't know how I land up
in trouble all the time.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.320
How did you say yes to this?
Like, who convinced you--

05:43.400 --> 05:44.440
You're gorgeous!

05:44.800 --> 05:46.640
-Oh, thank you! That's all I wanted.
-Are you crazy?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.440
-I thought it's a separate topic.
-That's all I wanted!

05:48.520 --> 05:50.680
Your drop-dead gorgeous
good looks got me here.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.720
-I think we're done for the day.
-And Sumukhi's high fashion.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.200
-Haven't you seen what she's worn today?
-Thank you, guys!

05:56.280 --> 05:57.760
It's a color-blocked layered cake.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.200
That's from Santacruz!

06:00.200 --> 06:01.160
Okay…

06:01.640 --> 06:02.520
That perhaps…

06:03.240 --> 06:04.400
But you look lovely!

06:04.560 --> 06:05.680
And I love the way you carry yourself.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.120
-I truly am a fan!
-Thank you!

06:07.200 --> 06:10.040
So, that's why I really need the
help of your humor device.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.480
-So, what do we do, how do we…
-No, that's fine.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.520
What do we-- I mean…

06:12.640 --> 06:14.080
It'll be great if we get to see…

06:14.200 --> 06:16.880
Everybody knows the film angle,

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
-Yeah.
-and the director angle.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.640
-But the personal stuff.
-Yeah!

06:19.720 --> 06:21.040
-The personal stuff.
-Especially like…

06:21.120 --> 06:22.440
some of the anecdotes
that you've mentioned

06:22.520 --> 06:24.080
where you know, the fact that…

06:24.160 --> 06:25.160
Your whole mid--

06:25.240 --> 06:26.400
The mid-life crisis angle.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.120
Or something else.
It'd be very interesting to…

06:28.280 --> 06:29.560
And I <i>am</i> going through it.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.760
Okay. So what is going on in the
mid-life crisis right now?

06:31.840 --> 06:32.800
What are the things you are feeling?

06:33.120 --> 06:34.600
Inappropriate fashion would be one.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.760
-Yeah.
-Like, mid-life…

06:35.840 --> 06:38.880
Second is, wanting to hang
with people half my age.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.040
-Yeah. Okay.
-It's reached that point,

06:41.240 --> 06:42.920
where I'm like, "Hey, what are
you guys doing?" and

06:43.000 --> 06:44.600
they're like, in their head bubble, like,

06:44.800 --> 06:48.120
"Nothing, uncle. Stay away!
Stay away. Stay out of my zone."

06:48.200 --> 06:51.920
The third is, recently,
I'm really trying hard to

06:52.000 --> 06:57.080
break through the pop culture of the
millennial and the Gen-Z generation.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.880
Tell me something. You're surrounding
yourself with so many young people.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.600
Are they really candid
and honest with you?

07:01.680 --> 07:04.040
I actually have the
opposite effect on people.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.520
For some reason, they feel
very obliged to be honest to me.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.480
Especially when I did that anthology
with Zoya, Dibakar, Anurag…

07:10.560 --> 07:12.840
I really felt like, you know…
And I really said,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.520
"I'm gonna do this anthology.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.760
I'm gonna start with Bombay Talkies

07:15.840 --> 07:18.360
because I really want that critics' nod."

07:18.440 --> 07:19.560
-I want it!
-Yeah.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.240
I wanted that community
to say that I can do it.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.920
So, I took close-ups of a lot of things.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.240
-Like this.
-These props.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.160
I swear, the props.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.200
In complete silence…

07:29.240 --> 07:30.720
So, they'd say it is "atmospheric".

07:30.880 --> 07:34.560
Then I'd take a long shot so
they'd say that it has a perspective.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.960
I made the characters enter slowly.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.240
-Mise-en-scène!
-I did a lot of things.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.360
I chose a sensational topic.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.160
I did everything, and…

07:41.240 --> 07:43.320
then it was like,
"Surprisingly, Karan Johar's film…"

07:43.400 --> 07:44.400
I was like…

07:44.520 --> 07:47.360
I never get praise from the
industry, I don't know why.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.080
Something about me irritates people.

07:49.880 --> 07:50.840
I don't know what it is.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.600
I think it's maybe
because I'm like potatoes,

07:52.680 --> 07:55.400
you put me everywhere,
and it somehow fits.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.640
I'm the potatoes of this industry.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.440
When people narrate comedy movies,

07:59.520 --> 08:00.960
are you a huge laugher?

08:01.040 --> 08:01.840
No, I don't laugh.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.000
-Oh, my God!
-Man!

08:03.080 --> 08:05.240
I don't know, I'm not…
So, I was gonna say that to you guys.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.960
I always tell people to
narrate comedies to me.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.680
And like, I'm laughing in my head.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.120
-That's the worst kind!
-No, Karan, don't do that to us!

08:11.200 --> 08:12.040
Don't do that.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.920
What is the strangest or funniest
narration you've had?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.040
-Yeah, the comedy narration, I don't know.
-The weird one.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.280
Oh, there was a director.
I won't mention his name.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.000
Very quiet, dignified,
soft-spoken gentleman.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.760
Had a sip of his water.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.120
And I was also, you know, like that.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.120
Suddenly, he just got up.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.880
That's when I was like…

08:30.080 --> 08:31.760
He began like
that and I was like…

08:31.840 --> 08:34.200
When he said, "We begin with a…"
and then he stood up.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
And he started going…

08:35.360 --> 08:37.440
He performed action on his own,

08:37.520 --> 08:39.160
-emotion, he started crying,
-God!

08:39.240 --> 08:41.240
he threw the chair
in the middle of an action.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.400
I was like, "He's going to hit me!

08:43.480 --> 08:44.840
He's going to kill me!

08:44.880 --> 08:46.720
I will not survive this narration."

08:46.840 --> 08:48.880
It didn't give me any sign.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.280
But okay apart from narration,

08:50.360 --> 08:51.880
who do you think is a
funny person in Bollywood?

08:52.000 --> 08:52.960
Who'd be good at stand-up?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.320
-Apart from…
-Javed Akhtar!

08:54.440 --> 08:56.080
-Javed Akhtar would be…
-He's hilarious!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.880
He told me once about Shabana.

08:58.520 --> 08:59.440
And very, like…

08:59.520 --> 09:02.280
He said, "Every time you tell
Shabana a joke, she tries to solve it."

09:06.080 --> 09:08.600
So, when you said who's the
funniest man in the fraternity,

09:08.640 --> 09:11.880
I'd say, undoubtedly Javed Akhtar.
and then Shahrukh Khan.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.840
-Of course.
-Shahrukh is hilarious!

09:13.880 --> 09:16.000
-He's too funny.
-His comedy is for like…

09:16.440 --> 09:18.480
-Like, a far more evolved audience.
-Evolved audience.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.360
Because people should be
able to take a joke at themselves.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.240
-Like I can.
-Yes!

09:21.320 --> 09:23.040
Who have you told that
you're doing stand-up?

09:23.200 --> 09:24.760
-Have you told anyone?
-No, not really.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.200
-Have you told your mom?
-Yeah!

09:26.280 --> 09:29.240
She already said that
"The things you do today…"

09:29.320 --> 09:31.360
and just shut the door on my face.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.440
I think it's a great omen, I must say.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.440
-It's like a great sign.
-Yeah, she was--

09:34.520 --> 09:37.400
I didn't get any good
wishes this morning, let me tell you!

09:37.480 --> 09:40.240
-I got like, "The things you do!"
-She just cursed you!

09:40.320 --> 09:43.120
And she just gave me that
Meryl Streep from <i>Devil Wears Prada</i> look

09:43.200 --> 09:44.080
and I had to…

09:44.160 --> 09:45.280
I get that from her all the time.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.000
That's all I get all the time.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.160
What do you really want to tell him?

09:48.240 --> 09:49.640
At any given point on stage,

09:49.880 --> 09:51.760
the most powerful person on
that stage is you.

09:51.840 --> 09:52.720
Has to be you.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.360
-So, maintain that power. Be like, okay.
-So, create that power energy.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.120
Yeah, but if you have
a little bit of sass,

09:57.200 --> 09:59.480
like, a good amount of…
20% sass has to be there.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.160
Where they're like,
"Okay, he's laughing at himself,

10:01.240 --> 10:02.440
but he can laugh at me too."

10:02.520 --> 10:03.440
If someone doesn't laugh,

10:03.520 --> 10:04.840
he's gonna be like,
"Why didn't you laugh?"

10:04.880 --> 10:06.240
I think you'll be amazing.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.840
I've seen and survived failure, madam.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.880
-I know what it feels like.
-That's too dramatic!

10:10.960 --> 10:11.840
One tear falling…

10:12.080 --> 10:13.640
It's <i>Karan ke Khayal</i>, come on.
It has to be.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.000
Oh! <i>Karan ke Khayal!</i>

10:15.120 --> 10:16.440
Okay, that's about me.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.720
But what do we do about you guys?

10:17.760 --> 10:19.520
You said power on stage,
like you've taught me,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.160
I wanna teach you fashion power.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.480
So, you'll teach us this in role reversal.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.880
Yeah, I mean I'll try.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.400
Because I don't promise success.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.520
'Cause raw material is very essential
and I don't have any.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.640
-Neither do we on stand-up, Karan.
-Hey, man!

10:32.400 --> 10:33.200
High-five!

10:33.400 --> 10:34.600
High-five! Savage!

10:34.640 --> 10:36.120
You're like my mom. I love it.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.880
-Sapan is actually--
-I'm gonna call you Hiroo.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.480
-Shall we go?
-Let's do it.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.760
-Okay, come. Let's go.
-Yeah, let's go.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.520
We have a rack full of clothes for you.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.960
So, I wanted to tell you that by mistake,

10:53.040 --> 10:55.400
he's stumbled into a very popular print.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.520
It's not by mistake, alright?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.360
-Really, you knew or what?
-I did research.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.040
-You did research? Alright.
-Yeah.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.880
Okay, we'll get into that later.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.840
And I wonder what that research was.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.880
Because it's tie-dye, I want to
make you wear something that I love…

11:06.960 --> 11:07.800
Okay.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.720
It's a red tie-dye.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.760
Voila!

11:15.360 --> 11:17.720
Which is your better profile?
Or do you have one at all?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.400
Can you please…

11:21.000 --> 11:22.480
-That's your… left.
-My left.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.440
That's your left.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.680
-Alright, you're turning her around.
-That's your right.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.960
I think your left is your better profile.

11:27.040 --> 11:27.880
-Is it the dimple?
-Okay.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
-Yeah.
-Thanks!

11:29.040 --> 11:30.440
-Okay, this is your better profile.
-Yeah.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.640
So, you can walk like that
everywhere you go.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.040
I'll do that.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.080
Yeah. Just sliding in.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.840
The other thing that has been congenial,

11:37.920 --> 11:39.800
has been constant, has been consistent,

11:39.880 --> 11:41.240
has been camouflage.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.400
-Right.
-And therefore, I'm giving you…

11:44.160 --> 11:45.720
-Oh, wow! Wow!
-Voila!

11:45.800 --> 11:47.200
-A camouflage jumper.
-Nice!

11:50.920 --> 11:52.000
-Get into the looks.
-Yes.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.840
-What's your better profile?
-You tell me.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.120
Is it left?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.440
Just walk straight.
You don't have a profile.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.120
-Alright, let's do it. Walk the talk.
-Yeah!

12:04.120 --> 12:04.920
-Stop.
-Stop.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.160
Pose.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.680
Profiles.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.040
-Sumukhi, get your act together.
-Yeah. Okay.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.040
We're done. Clap, clap.
Applause, applause.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.600
I'm semi-stressed, but
I know you guys are there.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.360
You're gonna be great.
You just have to be yourself.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.560
-Okay.
-With lines.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.400
Yeah, my problem is when I'm myself.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.720
Let's do this. Let's practice,
let's write some jokes.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.040
-Yeah.
-We'll see you over the weekend.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.960
-Alright. Thank you, guys!
-Okay! Thank you!

12:37.040 --> 12:40.120
I woke up and then I was like,
"Oh, God, I have this thing to do!"

12:40.360 --> 12:43.440
And then I got a very rare feeling.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.960
It was called anxiety of stage.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.560
Which I don't normally get.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.400
I got a little scared,
nervous, anxious and then…

12:50.840 --> 12:52.920
I closed my eyes and I imagined

12:53.240 --> 12:56.600
both of your wonderful, supportive faces.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.640
Thank God you said that.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.640
-Then I got so scared, after that!
-There it is.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.600
Any instructions?

13:02.680 --> 13:03.520
Thank you!

13:04.080 --> 13:06.320
-It's too…
-I think this is exactly what it is.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.200
Hold your power.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.360
I'm telling you, half your job is done.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.200
On stage, go self-deprecating but…

13:11.280 --> 13:13.160
-How long do I hold this power?
-No, no, no.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.480
I am tired of holding this power.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.040
When will it let go of me?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.040
Just one more night, sir.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.120
Then you can do what you want.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.040
Let's do a soundcheck.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.560
-We'll take you through the stage.
-Okay.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.720
Or you don't want to do that also?

13:23.800 --> 13:26.520
No, no, no. Are you cray-cray-cray?

13:26.760 --> 13:28.440
-I'm a stage baby.
-Stage baby!

13:28.520 --> 13:31.240
You think Mom and Dad will have
to hold my hand and carry me?

13:41.360 --> 13:44.520
Hello, hello!
God, you guys all showed up!

13:44.600 --> 13:47.680
Especially these two rows
would want eye contact from you.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.400
I know exactly what I was doing wrong.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.000
So, I won't let that happen.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.760
I think in the tech check, he was already

13:52.840 --> 13:54.160
-improvising a lot of jokes.
-Yeah.

13:54.320 --> 13:59.320
So, I hope he's in that zone
where he still does it uninhibitedly.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.640
So, this is my charity for the year.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.520
Okay.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.120
Who'll be the proudest seeing me perform?

14:04.200 --> 14:05.680
I think both my stage parents.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.440
My stage mummy and my stage daddy.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.960
They made me their
self-appointed stage baby, so

14:11.040 --> 14:12.640
I think they'll be the
proudest. Hopefully.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.880
He's not trying to be anything else.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.600
He's like, "This is me and
I'm going to improvise in my space."

14:16.680 --> 14:18.200
So, I think that's best.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.920
If tonight doesn't go well,
just look into the camera and say,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.600
<i>"Accha chalta hoon,</i>
<i>dua mein yaad rakhna…"</i>

14:34.800 --> 14:36.600
Have you guys noticed,
in the last two or three years,

14:36.680 --> 14:40.040
a lot of these multiplexes
have launched luxury theaters.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.400
One ticket for 1500 bucks.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.720
I paid. I wanted to see
what is this experience.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.600
I went inside. The minute you enter,

14:47.680 --> 14:49.680
there are like business class
reclining sofa seats.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.440
The minute you enter,
they hand you a pillow, a blanket.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.200
I'm like, "Bro, do you want me
to watch the movie or not?"

14:56.960 --> 14:58.000
What the hell?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.440
If you add one Medimix soap,
this will become an OYO room.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.640
That's where we are.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.040
What's the point?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.520
They don't even have normal food.
They have posh food now.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.160
Normally, you get samosas,
nachos and all. No!

15:12.240 --> 15:14.880
This is what they had on their menu.
They had Avocado Toast,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.080
Char-grilled Chicken Steak,

15:17.360 --> 15:19.040
California Sushi Roll.

15:19.880 --> 15:21.760
So posh! I think the
next thing they will say is,

15:21.840 --> 15:22.960
"Stag entry not allowed."

15:25.120 --> 15:25.920
There's a popcorn stall.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.120
I was like, finally, there's popcorn.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.520
I went there, I'm like, "Hi,
can I have some popcorn?"

15:28.600 --> 15:31.240
The guy was like,
"Sir, we have gourmet popcorn."

15:32.080 --> 15:33.920
I was like, 'No, I don't want
'ghur-me' (at home), I want it here.'

15:35.520 --> 15:36.400
Right now.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.120
I have popcorn at home.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.960
He was like, "No chance you're
getting popcorn after such a bad joke!"

15:43.200 --> 15:45.560
I know at some point, all of us have tried

15:45.640 --> 15:47.720
sneaking food into a multiplex.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.320
We've all done that, right?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.120
But there's that security guard outside.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.240
Have you seen that guy?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.040
That guy is a genius, dude!

15:54.520 --> 15:56.080
Place him on the national border.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.200
He manages to find food from
anywhere inside the bag.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.840
I took chips inside a laptop sleeve.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.200
He took that out, dude.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.720
Last time I went, he was like,

16:04.800 --> 16:07.400
"Sir, you have food stuck in your teeth.
Outside food not allowed."

16:08.400 --> 16:10.200
I'm like, "Are you a dentist too?
What's going on?"

16:11.120 --> 16:11.960
And I read this recently.

16:12.040 --> 16:15.000
Somebody has made this
online petition saying,

16:15.080 --> 16:18.320
"We should be allowed to carry
our own food inside theaters."

16:18.720 --> 16:19.720
But please…

16:20.600 --> 16:21.880
do not sign this shit.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.080
Because let me remind you
that we are Indians.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.640
Once you give us this liberty,

16:29.000 --> 16:29.920
we will not use it.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.080
We will exploit the shit out of it!

16:33.040 --> 16:35.120
Right? We'll carry anything inside.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.320
Forget popcorn, we'll carry corn
and a microwave oven inside.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.400
Right? And we'll be like,
"We will make popcorn right here."

16:45.520 --> 16:46.520
Alright.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.360
So…

16:48.800 --> 16:51.840
Usually, this man is the
one who's responsible

16:51.920 --> 16:53.800
for launching new talent into Bollywood.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.840
But tonight, we're launching him
into the world of stand-up comedy.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.520
So, ladies and gents, come on.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.040
Start clapping and cheering
and please welcome to the stage…

17:02.400 --> 17:05.160
Karan Johar!

17:17.920 --> 17:19.080
Oh, my God!

17:24.680 --> 17:26.200
God, so many of you showed up!

17:27.680 --> 17:29.200
Not that I need any introduction.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.400
But I am Karan Johar.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.560
I'm a producer, I'm a director.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.800
I'm a host.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.680
I'm also the man responsible for

17:36.760 --> 17:38.960
setting unrealistic standards in college.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.720
So, people keep saying,

17:45.800 --> 17:48.560
"Karan, you only launch privileged people

17:48.800 --> 17:51.280
who would become superstars anyway.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.800
Why don't you launch somebody
who has no chance at stardom?

17:54.920 --> 17:56.560
Nothing! Absolutely nothing!"

17:56.800 --> 17:57.800
Then Sapan called.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.200
I've been in the industry only… what?

18:04.280 --> 18:05.160
23 years.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.960
So, naturally, when a fan comes up to me,

18:08.240 --> 18:10.000
what is he or she meant to tell me, right?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.320
They come up to me and they say,

18:11.440 --> 18:12.720
"What's in the hamper?"

18:14.160 --> 18:16.800
I'm like, "Dude! I have a career!

18:17.000 --> 18:18.880
It stretches nearly 25 years.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.960
You want to know what's in
my freaking coffee hamper?"

18:21.760 --> 18:23.480
That's the legacy I've left behind.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.680
Freaking coffee.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.560
It hurts!

18:28.760 --> 18:30.720
I'm turning 50.
I know I don't look it!

18:32.160 --> 18:33.320
Thank you!

18:34.080 --> 18:36.000
I'm really struggling though.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.760
To be not out of touch.

18:37.800 --> 18:38.880
You know when you wanna be

18:38.960 --> 18:41.520
with the Gen-Zs and
the millennial generations?

18:41.880 --> 18:44.680
It's my self-aware mid-life crisis.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.280
So, the other day,
a teenager came up to me and said that

18:48.560 --> 18:50.160
"I love K-dramas!"

18:50.240 --> 18:52.640
I said, "Which one?
<i>K3G</i> or <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai?"</i>

18:54.040 --> 18:56.960
Then they gave me such a blank,
straight-face look and I said

18:57.280 --> 18:59.080
"Sorry, man. I didn't know
you were talking about

18:59.160 --> 19:02.200
<i>Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi</i>
and <i>Kasauti Zindagi Ki."</i>

19:03.800 --> 19:05.720
Then the K 'pop'ped in my head!

19:06.480 --> 19:09.720
Okay. Even my clothes have become
more Gen-Z, as you can see.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.080
Like, double chain.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.720
That's the way…

19:12.800 --> 19:13.560
<i>Mahi way!</i>

19:13.800 --> 19:14.560
Anyway…

19:16.560 --> 19:19.080
In fact, I love flaunting
my clothes so much

19:19.200 --> 19:20.800
sometimes I drive to the airport.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.200
Literally, drive to
the airport just to get papped.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.040
Now, you know that
we pay the paps, you know.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.520
And then we all pretend when we
come out and there are cameras,

19:28.560 --> 19:30.800
like "Oh, they're here!
How do they find out?"

19:31.040 --> 19:32.000
We paid you!

19:32.520 --> 19:33.560
That's why you're here.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.320
I know, I'm privileged.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.640
I grew up in Malabar Hill.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.880
I love Almond Milk, Avocado Smoothie,

19:40.960 --> 19:43.240
my shoes cost more than
the budget of <i>Kalank.</i>

19:45.480 --> 19:46.880
Should've stuck to my shoes.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.800
But I've had my own struggles, guys.

19:50.920 --> 19:51.800
I've had.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.720
It pains me to say this, but…

19:53.960 --> 19:55.080
I've struggled.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.920
I'm gonna take a moment because…

19:58.320 --> 20:00.040
it's reminded me of my struggles.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.640
Yeah, just…

20:10.080 --> 20:11.280
I'll do a "Tabu".

20:14.800 --> 20:16.440
I'm a struggling actor.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.400
And now with my mid-life crisis,

20:19.480 --> 20:22.240
I'm getting desperate to
go pursue my Bollywood dream.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.320
I'm a man in Bollywood who's almost 50.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.440
So, obviously, roles are limited, right?

20:27.760 --> 20:31.040
I mean I know I could play a
college boy for just five years more.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.440
I mean, it's hard.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.280
I did a film, by the way.
I did a film.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.520
2015.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.520
It was called <i>Bombay Velvet.</i>

20:40.560 --> 20:43.200
Give me a cheer
if you saw <i>Bombay Velvet.</i>

20:44.520 --> 20:45.440
Shit!

20:47.080 --> 20:48.240
And it still flopped.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.440
Shit, that film wasn't received well
at all at the box office.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.760
It got thrashed.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.760
But you know what, I didn't even get
one single bad review. Not one.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.080
I genuinely think
I wasn't so bad in the film.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.080
I mean, not because
I'm speaking for myself,

21:00.160 --> 21:01.440
but I wasn't so bad.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.760
In fact, I think people loved me.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.280
They loved me!

21:06.000 --> 21:08.480
But it's been seven years since that day.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.720
Not a single offer.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.560
Not even a freaking bad one.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.880
I told Zoya Akhtar…

21:14.160 --> 21:15.080
You know, Zoya Akhtar.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.320
"Why don't you cast me in <i>Made in Heaven?</i>

21:17.760 --> 21:19.960
Rich people, rich weddings,
rich problems…

21:20.080 --> 21:20.920
Totally me!

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I can only see…

21:22.080 --> 21:23.680
That's the role that I was made for!"

21:24.200 --> 21:26.280
And she said she wants
to cast talented actors.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.400
Who does that?

21:30.320 --> 21:32.000
Who freaking casts talented actors?

21:32.880 --> 21:34.240
I don't know when I last did that.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.440
The only time I get to
really channel my inner actor

21:37.520 --> 21:38.720
is when I watch preview screenings.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.720
You know, when you go to
watch other directors' movies.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.160
And you've hated it, so you just say,

21:43.240 --> 21:45.520
"Man, I'm speechless!"

21:46.960 --> 21:47.760
Could mean anything.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.280
And they're like, "Really?"
I'm like, "Really speechless!"

21:52.080 --> 21:54.200
I thought the one benefit
of my mid-life crisis was

21:54.280 --> 21:56.920
actually that people would
give me some respect, though.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.440
I have to say. Some respect.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.800
Some little respect, not asking for much.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.120
But for some reason, everyone feels
comfortable being honest with me.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.280
Sometimes, too freaking honest!

22:07.120 --> 22:08.680
I don't have any "Yes-men".

22:08.760 --> 22:10.880
I have "Yes-you-really-suck-men".

22:11.960 --> 22:13.160
Okay, that came out all wrong.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.560
I mean, even if I do, it's legal.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.040
So…

22:31.520 --> 22:34.360
Mom, you're gonna watch this;
you're gonna kill me.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.520
I just know it, you know,

22:36.600 --> 22:38.240
this is-- This is not a roast.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.800
I'm just… This is a toast.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.760
A toast to you, a toast to everyone here.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.360
I don't know why people
who are so mean to me

22:45.440 --> 22:47.800
don't have the basic decency
and courtesy to

22:47.880 --> 22:49.760
bitch about me behind my back.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.640
Like I do.

22:51.640 --> 22:52.840
Why can't they just do that?

22:52.920 --> 22:55.840
I mean like, if you really
want to insult me to my face,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.400
just come on <i>Koffee with Karan!</i>

23:02.360 --> 23:05.400
The biggest sign of
my mid-life crisis is that

23:05.640 --> 23:07.600
I still live with my mummy.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.160
My mummy… My mummy.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.280
Oh, God!

23:11.480 --> 23:13.320
My mum is 79.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.920
She's ten years older
than my favorite thing.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.160
Online trolls don't bother me because

23:24.240 --> 23:26.560
my mum is my biggest troll.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.160
So, I was thinking about getting
botox done in the future.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.120
I really was.

23:31.840 --> 23:32.920
Not that I need it.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.120
You see?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.160
So, I asked my mom

23:37.240 --> 23:40.600
which part of my face
requires any fillers.

23:40.800 --> 23:41.720
She said, "Your face is fine.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.480
What about your scripts?
They need fillers."

23:47.680 --> 23:51.960
Yeah, of course, I agree my movies are
a little over the top.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.000
But realism is overrated, right? It is.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.160
It's totally overrated.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.480
Sometimes you need to believe that
if you are a plus-sized kid,

23:59.800 --> 24:01.400
and called Laddoo,

24:01.480 --> 24:03.720
you grow up and look like Hrithik Roshan.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.240
I mean, dude. Hrithik Roshan is hot!

24:06.320 --> 24:08.680
Didn't you love him
in the homo-erotic <i>War?</i>

24:09.880 --> 24:12.280
It's the first time I saw a freaking man

24:12.360 --> 24:14.680
get introduced and
only men were looking at him!

24:15.320 --> 24:17.280
Did you see Ashutosh Rana's face?

24:17.840 --> 24:20.000
He looked like he saw
Disha Patani on the beach.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.720
When all he did was see Hrithik Roshan

24:22.800 --> 24:24.440
coming out in slow motion.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.680
Hrithik looked drop-dead gorgeous!

24:26.760 --> 24:28.800
And even Tiger Shroff says, "Get in line."

24:28.880 --> 24:31.480
I'm like, I wanna be in that line, too.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.640
Duggu is the man to go to!

24:37.560 --> 24:38.960
People have exes.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.440
People have exes. We all do.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.280
I know I do, I'm sure all of you do.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.240
Unless you are an
ex yourself right now and…

24:44.600 --> 24:46.360
My apologies, <i>"Channa Mereya"</i> to you.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.040
People have exes who
come back in their lives.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.720
I have ex-movies!

24:51.920 --> 24:54.560
I can't watch my old stuff. I cringe.
I literally cringe.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.360
Even I can't watch the climax of
<i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,</i>

24:57.440 --> 24:59.240
where Rani walks like a ghost.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.760
She walks like a ghost as she
gets her ex-husband married.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.280
Poor thing! I made her
attend her ex's wedding.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.720
Dude, she named her daughter after
her husband's ex-best friend,

25:10.080 --> 25:11.440
who was in love with him!

25:11.560 --> 25:12.520
Who does that?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
It's like Angelina Jolie naming
her child Jennifer!

25:16.800 --> 25:17.720
Ain't gonna happen.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.440
It ain't gonna happen.
Only happens in Bollywood.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.560
It happens only in India.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.720
And this isn't me justifying
my earlier movies at all.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.600
But we learn, we grow over time, you know.
It takes a while.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.320
I'm sure we all have Facebook memories

25:31.440 --> 25:33.160
we're all completely embarrassed of!

25:33.480 --> 25:35.640
Who has really embarrassing
Facebook memories?

25:36.240 --> 25:39.440
Nobody? You're all gorgeous, beautiful
Aishwarya Rais here in the audience?

25:39.600 --> 25:40.440
Nobody?

25:41.520 --> 25:43.760
What a vain lot of people!

25:43.960 --> 25:45.480
Y'all actually think that y'all click

25:45.560 --> 25:47.600
really good photographs of yourselves?

25:47.720 --> 25:50.640
Just because you all are masked
doesn't mean I can't see!

25:55.240 --> 25:56.040
Anyway.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.560
I hope with all my heart

25:57.640 --> 25:59.360
that I haven't offended anyone of you.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.720
'Cause I don't want to go to jail.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.600
Though it seems everyone is there.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.160
It's like the new Maldives.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.920
Okay, so I'm gonna wrap up.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.240
I've got to go because
I've to launch a new star kid.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.760
Ehh-- Newcomer.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.840
Newcomer. Newcomer. Newcomer.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.120
Keep saying that. Outsider-newcomer.
Outsider-newcomer.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.360
Okay. But if you have
any acting offers for me,

26:23.440 --> 26:26.400
please contact Sumukhi or Sapan
because no one else is!

26:27.120 --> 26:28.440
So, just make sure you do.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.720
And let me tell you, I'm not this mean.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.080
I'm really not this mean.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.400
I'm way worse!

26:34.160 --> 26:35.120
Remember that!

26:35.560 --> 26:36.680
Anyway…

26:37.920 --> 26:38.960
Alright, thanks, guys!

26:39.040 --> 26:43.120
And if everyone asks you how my
stand-up set-piece was,

26:43.560 --> 26:45.920
just like me, don't say "I'm speechless!"

26:46.000 --> 26:48.400
Just actually, have a
few good words to say.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.840
Alright, bye and toodles!

26:49.920 --> 26:50.840
Love you, guys! Thank you!

26:50.920 --> 26:52.760
Thank you for being
such a great audience!

26:56.560 --> 26:57.800
Mummy, how was it?

26:57.880 --> 26:59.960
It was so good! Guys, I was like this!

27:00.680 --> 27:02.400
So good, Karan. It was so good!

27:02.480 --> 27:03.840
He was amazing!

27:03.920 --> 27:04.960
You guys know he was amazing!

27:05.040 --> 27:06.560
-Please, clap once again.
-Clap, yes!

27:06.680 --> 27:07.800
He was amazing!

27:08.080 --> 27:09.160
How did you feel?

27:09.800 --> 27:12.440
Me, do this for the first time.
I was like I haven't done this.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.440
I mean, we talk a lot of rubbish
but in confined circles.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.400
And when it's not recorded…

27:19.120 --> 27:20.760
we say the darned-est things!

27:22.200 --> 27:24.000
I wish there was a camera
sometimes, you know,

27:24.080 --> 27:27.280
that would be material that was
made up of some other form of gold!

27:27.440 --> 27:30.840
But this is what we get when we
actually scratch the surface,

27:30.920 --> 27:31.800
not break it.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.360
So, we scratched the surface today,
but we had great fun doing it.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.800
So, thank you, guys!
Thank you, Amazon, <i>One Mic Stand</i> rocks.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.720
-Sapan and Sumukhi rock!
-Give it up for Karan Johar, everyone!

27:40.640 --> 27:42.120
Give it up for Sumukhi Suresh!

27:42.960 --> 27:44.040
I'm your host Sapan Verma,

27:44.120 --> 27:45.840
thank you so much!
It's <i>One Mic Stand!</i>

27:46.480 --> 27:47.600
-Bye! Good night!
-Thank you.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.720
Thank God! I actually was
very hot on that stage.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.600
Maybe it was the result of my nervousness

28:00.680 --> 28:02.040
and perhaps, the AC.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.640
But I was hot and I was…

28:03.720 --> 28:05.680
But I was like, "When will this end?"

28:05.760 --> 28:07.080
I didn't realize it was as long as it was,

28:07.160 --> 28:09.600
and I was doing it without
any breaks and all.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.560
When you started talking to the crowd
and they laughed

28:11.640 --> 28:13.840
when you did the natural thing of
addressing your mom…

28:13.920 --> 28:16.360
-Yeah.
-I think the most real Karan came out.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.840
Yeah, when you were like
"Mom, I'm so sorry."

28:17.920 --> 28:19.600
Everyone was like,
"Yeah, yeah. Mom. Right.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.960
Yeah, Karan. Same. Relate."

28:21.040 --> 28:23.120
I wouldn't have been able
to do this without you.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.680
I'm supposed to say that, I think.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.040
-No, no.
-Okay.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.560
-We get that a lot.
-But I genuinely wouldn't have

28:27.640 --> 28:29.000
been able to do this without you!

28:29.080 --> 28:31.520
Y'all had the right kind of energy and
it was amazing!

28:31.600 --> 28:33.880
You didn't stress me out and
nobody over-instructed me,

28:34.080 --> 28:35.080
and I think that's best.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.520
Thank you, guys!
This was great fun!

28:36.600 --> 28:38.400
-It was awesome!
-And I hope everyone enjoys it as well.
