05:05.770 --> 05:07.362
THE FACT THAT YOU PUT OUR KIDS

05:07.370 --> 05:08.428
IN HARMS WAY LIKE THAT.

05:08.430 --> 05:09.772
>> NO, NO. YOU THINK THIS WAS MY

YOUR HOUSE. HOW COULD YOU NOT

05:19.750 --> 05:21.012

06:01.490 --> 06:02.479
COMING TO HIS RESCUE ALL THE

TIME. I THINK WE SHOULD GO

06:04.130 --> 06:06.587
TO THE POLICE.

06:06.590 --> 06:07.579
>> YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT ITS

06:07.590 --> 06:09.353
OK FOR MY KID TO GO TO JAIL?

06:09.360 --> 06:10.361
>> WELL, IT MIGHT BE THE BEST

06:10.370 --> 06:11.496
THING FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

06:11.500 --> 06:12.489
I MEAN, IT HASNT WORKED FOR HIM

06:12.500 --> 06:13.797
COMING OUT HERE, HAS IT?

06:13.800 --> 06:15.097
>> AND LET THE PRISON SYSTEM

06:15.100 --> 06:16.431
TEACH HIM RIGHT FROM WRONG

06:16.440 --> 06:18.692
BECAUSE I COULDNT?

06:18.700 --> 06:20.679
>> MAYBE. I MEAN, JUST MAYBE.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.806
ITS NOT BECAUSE OF HIS PARENTS

06:21.810 --> 06:23.107
OR HIS TEACHERS OR HIS SCHOOL

06:24.450 --> 06:26.702
I MEAN, IT COULD BE IN HIS DNA.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.109
YOU KNOW, MY DAD WAS A RAPIST.

06:28.110 --> 06:29.589
MAYBE IT SKIPS A GENERATION.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.683
>> DONT SAY THAT. HE IS A GOOD

06:31.690 --> 06:32.452
KID.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.415
>> NO, JULIA, HES NOT A GOOD

06:33.420 --> 06:35.456
KID. YOU JUST CANT ADMIT IT

06:35.460 --> 06:36.449
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS TOO

06:36.460 --> 06:37.654
PAINFUL, ALL RIGHT? BUT WE NEED

06:37.660 --> 06:39.116
TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR

06:39.120 --> 06:40.826
HIS SAKE AS WELL AS OURS.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.127
IVE CONTACTED A LAWYER AND TOLD

06:42.130 --> 06:43.529
HIM THAT MA'ITS GONNA TURN

06:43.530 --> 06:45.122
HIMSELF IN.

06:45.130 --> 06:46.097
YOU KNOW, SINCE HE WAS THE ONLY

06:46.100 --> 06:46.998
ONE HE MANAGED TO HURT, MAYBE

06:47.000 --> 06:48.160
THE JUDGE WILL BE LENIENT ON

06:48.170 --> 06:49.159
HIM, YOU KNOW?

06:49.170 --> 06:50.728
>> AND SEAN AGREES WITH YOU?

06:50.740 --> 06:51.832
>> NO, SEAN DOESNT AGREE WITH

06:56.810 --> 06:57.799
YOU KNOW ITS THE BEST THING FOR

06:57.810 --> 07:00.813
HIM. I NEED YOUR SUPPORT.

07:07.550 --> 07:08.812
>> HE LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL,

07:08.820 --> 07:11.027
DOESNT HE?

07:11.030 --> 07:13.089
>> LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.

07:17.430 --> 07:18.658
YOU KNOW, THERE COMES A TIME YOU

07:18.660 --> 07:19.661
HAVE TO SURRENDER THE IDEA OF

07:19.670 --> 07:21.638
WHO YOUR CHILDREN COULD BE

07:21.640 --> 07:23.062
TO THE REALITY OF WHO THEY

07:23.070 --> 07:25.106
ACTUALLY ARE.

07:41.230 --> 07:42.549
>> TELL US WHAT YOU DONT LIKE

07:42.560 --> 07:45.085
ABOUT YOURSELF, MS. SULLIVAN.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.558
>> I LIKE MYSELF FINE.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.754
ITS MY SISTER MOIRA.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.658
I WANT YOU TO GET HER OFF MY

07:49.670 --> 07:51.661
BACK.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.559
I MEAN IT OFF MY BACK.

07:54.570 --> 07:55.662
I PROMISED MY THERAPIST I WOULD

07:55.670 --> 07:57.763
NEVER CALL IT "HER" AGAIN.

08:05.580 --> 08:08.048
THIS IS MOIRA.

08:08.050 --> 08:10.109
I ABSORBED HER IN UTERO.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.715
SHE--IT IS--I DONT REALLY KNOW

08:13.720 --> 08:15.017
THE MEDICAL TERM.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.578
>> A PARASITIC TWIN.

08:16.590 --> 08:18.615
>> YES. EXCEPT IM NOT SUPPOSED

08:18.620 --> 08:19.621
TO USE THE WORD "TWIN" ANYMORE

08:19.630 --> 08:21.166
EITHER. ITS JUST A BUNCH OF

08:21.170 --> 08:22.592
EXTRA BONE, BLOOD, AND TISSUE

08:22.600 --> 08:23.692
MASS.

08:23.700 --> 08:27.761
SEE, THATS HER LITTLE LEG,

08:27.770 --> 08:29.772
AND THATS PART OF AN ARM.

08:29.780 --> 08:31.179
>> UH, IS THIS THE FIRST TIME

08:31.180 --> 08:33.774
YOUVE CONSIDERED REMOVAL?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.634
>> UM, MOTHER HAD PLANNED TO

08:35.640 --> 08:37.631
HAVE HER--IT REMOVED WHEN I WAS

08:37.640 --> 08:40.712
NO LONGER A TODDLER, BUT BY THAT

08:40.720 --> 08:43.518
TIME, SHE WAS MOIRA.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.919
SHE WAS PART OF THE FAMILY, AND

08:44.920 --> 08:46.239
SURGERY BECAME SOMETHING WE KEPT

08:46.250 --> 08:47.285
PU'I'I'ING OFF.

08:47.290 --> 08:48.746
>> SO SHE ACTUALLY BECAME REAL

08:48.750 --> 08:51.127
TO YOU.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.722
>> MOTHER LIVED IN A POWERFUL

08:52.730 --> 08:54.755
FANTASY WORLD.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.954
AND HER BELIEF THAT MOIRA WAS

08:55.960 --> 08:57.689
HER OTHER DAUGHTER TOOK OVER OUR

08:57.700 --> 08:59.736
LIVES. AND I WAS SO YOUNG,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.765
IT JUST SEEMED NORMAL.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.135
>> WHERE WAS YOUR FATHER?

09:03.140 --> 09:04.732
DID HE JUST GO ALONG WITH THIS?

09:04.740 --> 09:06.162
>> THERE WAS NO FATHER.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.603
IT WAS ALWAYS JUST US.

09:07.610 --> 09:08.759
SHE CAN MAKE ONE AND ONE ADD UP

09:08.770 --> 09:10.749
TO 3, MY MOTHER.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.648
[CHUCKLES SOFI'LY]

09:11.650 --> 09:13.618
I COULDNT ARGUE WITH HER.

09:13.620 --> 09:14.871
SHE WAS THE SOURCE OF EVERYTHING

09:14.880 --> 09:17.644
FOR ME--ALL THINGS GOOD AND ALL

09:17.650 --> 09:19.652
THINGS TERRIFYING.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.752
SHE USED TO MAKE ME PLAY PIANO

09:20.760 --> 09:23.183
FOR HER AND MOIRA.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.122
SINCE I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS

09:24.130 --> 09:25.324
CHOSEN TO SURVIVE, I FELT LIKE I

09:25.330 --> 09:26.729
OWED IT TO THEM TO BE DOUBLY

09:26.730 --> 09:27.754
BRILLIANT.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.852
>> SHE PROJECTED HER OWN LI'I'I'LE

09:28.860 --> 09:30.236
WORLD ON TO YOU AND NEVER

09:30.240 --> 09:31.662
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT DO

09:31.670 --> 09:32.659
TO YOU?

09:32.670 --> 09:34.797
I CALL THAT CHILD ABUSE.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.734
>> THATS AMAZING.

09:36.740 --> 09:40.642
THATS WHAT MY THERAPIST SAYS.

09:40.650 --> 09:42.606
MOTHERS GONE NOW.

09:42.610 --> 09:45.738
AND, UM, IM MAKING MY DEBUT AT

09:45.750 --> 09:47.775
ROYCE HALL.

09:47.780 --> 09:48.940
I NEVER COULD PLAY PUBLICLY

09:48.950 --> 09:50.611
BEFORE BECAUSE I LOOKED LIKE

09:50.620 --> 09:51.814
SUCH A--WELL, YOU KNOW.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.617
YOURE LOOKING AT ME.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.655
I WANT TO WEAR AN IVORY GOWN

09:54.660 --> 09:56.059
WITH BARE SHOULDERS.

09:56.060 --> 09:56.958
I WANT TO BE SEEN AS A REAL

09:56.960 --> 09:59.758
WOMAN.

09:59.770 --> 10:00.896
FOR SO LONG, I TRIED TO BE THE

10:00.900 --> 10:03.289
GOOD GIRL, THE GOOD GIRL WHO

10:03.300 --> 10:04.619
SURVIVED WHAT THEY WANTED ME TO

10:04.630 --> 10:07.793
BE. AND NOW ITS MY TURN.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.838
>> OH, NO ADDRESS BOOKS OR EVEN

10:18.840 --> 10:20.319
SOME OLD MAIL?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.639
ARE YOU SURE THE MOVERS PACKED

10:21.650 --> 10:22.617
UP EVERYTHING?

10:22.620 --> 10:24.781
>> NO PICTURES, NO RECORDS.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.644
NOTHING.

10:26.650 --> 10:27.685
ITS LIKE TEDDY JUST VANISHED

10:27.690 --> 10:28.782
INTO THIN AIR.

10:28.790 --> 10:29.927
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE

10:29.930 --> 10:31.898
CAME TO HER CONDO AND CLEANED IT

10:31.900 --> 10:33.891
OUT BEFORE WE GOT THERE.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.798
>> WELL, LIKE WHO?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.028
>> I DONT KNOW. SOME FRIEND,

10:36.030 --> 10:37.019
RELATIVE.

10:37.030 --> 10:39.669
>> WHY DONT YOU CALL THEM?

10:39.670 --> 10:40.762
>> 1-1 D-DONT KNOW THEIR

10:40.770 --> 10:41.930
NAM ES, OK?

10:41.940 --> 10:43.032
>> YOU NEVER MET ANY OF HER

10:43.040 --> 10:44.803
FRIENDS OR FAMILY?

10:44.810 --> 10:49.338
>> SHE WAS FROM TEXAS, JULIA.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.944
