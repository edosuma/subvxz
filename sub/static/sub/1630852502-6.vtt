00:00.398 --> 00:02.299
Oh, sorry.

00:03.331 --> 00:04.875
Dinner, my place?

00:04.900 --> 00:08.135
I thought we finished with all
that about five years ago.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.095
Doctor Amed?

00:10.931 --> 00:12.596
Bash.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.541
<i>Lockdown. Code silver.</i>

00:38.566 --> 00:41.126
<i>Lockdown. Code Silver.</i>

00:42.289 --> 00:43.790
Can I help?

00:43.815 --> 00:45.740
No. I got it. It's fine. Go.

00:45.765 --> 00:47.515
I'll go find some gauze
and come right back.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.296
No. There's gauze in the cabinet.
I can make it. Go.

00:50.928 --> 00:53.935
You'll be okay, I can stop the bleeding
as soon as the shooter clears.

00:56.430 --> 00:59.131
You're going to be okay.

01:14.864 --> 01:16.542
Can you move?

01:28.203 --> 01:29.737
Did you see him?

01:29.762 --> 01:31.430
The last shots came from hallway J.

01:31.455 --> 01:34.076
- You shouldn't be in the open.
- Are you okay?

01:34.101 --> 01:36.121
I've got a through-and-through
to the neck.

01:36.161 --> 01:37.298
Another in the thigh.

01:37.355 --> 01:39.659
Mine's an abdominal wound and
a shot to the right humerus.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.065
I applied a tourniquet to try
and stabilize his pressure,

01:42.090 --> 01:43.580
but it's still dropping in critical.

01:43.605 --> 01:44.625
Pressure right there.

01:44.650 --> 01:46.713
There might not be anything
else you can do for him.

01:46.738 --> 01:47.800
Well, maybe if I...

01:47.825 --> 01:49.683
Maybe if I bolus him with fluids,

01:49.708 --> 01:52.386
we'll keep him going until we
can activate massive contusion.

01:52.861 --> 01:55.300
Get down, get down.

02:08.970 --> 02:11.195
<i>Lights on.</i>

02:11.220 --> 02:13.552
<i>That concludes the active shooter drill.</i>

02:13.577 --> 02:15.488
- God...
- <i>Thank you everyone.</i>

02:15.863 --> 02:18.723
Well, I lost mine, how'd you
manage to stabilize yours?

02:20.718 --> 02:22.132
Bash?

02:22.706 --> 02:24.007
Bash?

02:24.542 --> 02:27.934
Hey, don't worry, I was going
to die no matter what you did.

02:34.556 --> 02:36.257
And now we find out how we did.

02:36.282 --> 02:37.883
My guy was gonna die all along.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.771
If I had no hope of saving
him, what was the point?

02:39.796 --> 02:41.834
Maybe that was the point.
To see how you'd handle it.

02:41.859 --> 02:44.507
- Well then, I failed.
- Pretty sure it's not pass or fail.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.194
Whole purpose of the
drill is to make sure

02:46.219 --> 02:47.890
we're prepared for the real thing.

02:48.714 --> 02:50.709
Alright, thanks.

02:50.734 --> 02:53.972
We're gonna have a full post-mortem
with the observers tomorrow.

02:53.997 --> 02:55.764
We're gonna review the tape,

02:55.789 --> 02:58.974
and we're gonna discuss any
course corrections in depth.

02:59.163 --> 03:00.164
In the interim,

03:00.189 --> 03:02.810
I want you to think about how
you're feeling right now.

03:02.846 --> 03:05.913
And how you responded to the
situations you've faced.

03:06.046 --> 03:08.858
You were trying to solve a
problem that couldn't be solved.

03:08.883 --> 03:11.272
You should've called that
patient and moved on.

03:11.297 --> 03:14.452
Learn to control what you can,
and let go of what you can't.

03:14.477 --> 03:17.662
Right? You're an island.
But you work on a team.

03:17.687 --> 03:19.102
You could've stopped
the bleeding quicker

03:19.127 --> 03:21.312
if you'd let Dr. Hamed
help you get supplies.

03:22.959 --> 03:26.834
Calm under pressure, no surprise
there, but you took huge risks.

03:26.866 --> 03:29.357
You can't save lives if
you've sacrificed your own.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.507
Huh? Alright.

03:46.755 --> 03:51.250
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:04.191 --> 04:05.896
Changed your mind?

04:06.378 --> 04:08.792
I... I pressed the wrong button.

04:11.505 --> 04:13.974
Heard there was an active
shooter drill today.

04:15.858 --> 04:17.903
Always cracks a few residents.

04:18.276 --> 04:19.869
Did your patient fake die?

04:19.894 --> 04:21.798
Fake lived, actually.

04:31.338 --> 04:32.960
Mr. Gomes?

04:33.208 --> 04:34.567
I'm Dr. Hamed.

04:34.592 --> 04:36.436
I understand you've
been experiencing some

04:36.461 --> 04:38.436
chest pains and dizziness.

04:39.041 --> 04:41.131
- When did this start?
- Earlier this week.

04:41.162 --> 04:43.986
I was trying to ignore it,

04:44.011 --> 04:46.346
but I think that was a
bad idea because...

04:46.533 --> 04:48.686
now my left arm is tingling.

04:50.359 --> 04:51.913
Deep breath.

04:53.905 --> 04:56.307
It can't be... it can't
be a heart attack, right?

04:56.332 --> 04:57.983
I mean, I'm too young.

04:58.874 --> 05:00.608
Are you a smoker, Mr. Gomes?

05:00.731 --> 05:03.164
Kevin. No, never.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.633
I got scared straight by that

05:05.658 --> 05:08.320
shrivelled lung they
showed us in sixth grade.

05:09.344 --> 05:12.154
Any family history of heart problems?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.034
Not that I know of.

05:14.235 --> 05:16.623
They don't keep me in
the loop on everything.

05:26.195 --> 05:29.431
Hello, I'm Dr. Leblanc.

05:30.328 --> 05:32.696
You're from Station
19 around the corner?

05:32.721 --> 05:34.322
Take a deep breath.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.025
Best post I've had.

05:37.197 --> 05:40.088
Busy, though. We stretched
three times last night.

05:40.113 --> 05:41.189
Mm.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.403
Do you wear a respirator?

05:44.523 --> 05:46.452
The tanks are only good for 20 minutes,

05:46.713 --> 05:48.447
sometimes we're in longer.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.949
They're heavy, so we just
ditch them when they run out.

05:52.438 --> 05:54.109
Did you run out last night?

05:54.757 --> 05:56.090
Yeah.

05:56.752 --> 05:59.132
We pulled a couple
from a bad house fire.

05:59.898 --> 06:02.140
Got in as fast as we could,
but they didn't make it.

06:02.671 --> 06:05.104
Have you ever been diagnosed
with high blood pressure?

06:05.129 --> 06:09.158
No. I eat right, I exercise,

06:09.183 --> 06:10.914
I don't drink.

06:11.115 --> 06:14.751
I just can't catch a break right now.

06:15.189 --> 06:18.379
First I, uh... First I
lose my job, and then...

06:19.131 --> 06:20.998
And then I had to move.

06:22.812 --> 06:25.511
Deep breath. Deep breath.

06:32.200 --> 06:34.869
Alright. Your blood pressure is high,

06:34.894 --> 06:37.620
and your heart rate has
elevated since you got here.

06:38.395 --> 06:40.144
Is that what you were feeling before?

06:40.248 --> 06:42.362
What do you... What do you
think is wrong with me?

06:42.387 --> 06:43.888
Um, we'll order some tests.

06:44.147 --> 06:47.450
Uh, some blood work
and an ECG, and uh...

06:48.788 --> 06:51.286
Try not to worry, this
is standard procedure.

06:51.436 --> 06:53.646
Right. Thanks, Doc.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.459
My dad was a firefighter,

06:56.576 --> 06:59.389
and he always said you
save the next one.

06:59.414 --> 07:00.914
Yeah.

07:02.461 --> 07:04.091
Okay.

07:05.615 --> 07:08.162
Mm. Your nails are blue.

07:08.245 --> 07:09.710
How long have they been like that?

07:09.735 --> 07:11.569
They are? I dunno.

07:12.843 --> 07:15.435
And your O2 sats are 88%.

07:16.247 --> 07:18.749
I want to send you for
pulmonary function testing.

07:18.865 --> 07:21.344
I've been doing this ten years.
I bounce back every time.

07:21.369 --> 07:23.617
Yeah, I don't doubt it.
But you're here now,

07:23.642 --> 07:25.529
so better be safe than sorry, right?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.303
If the thing you loved
was slowly killing you,

07:36.328 --> 07:37.929
would you, A, stop and save yourself,

07:37.954 --> 07:39.955
or B, continue and risk it?

07:40.021 --> 07:42.429
I would decide not to follow
you down this particular

07:42.454 --> 07:44.281
rabbit hole today.

07:44.972 --> 07:46.785
Oh my God, it's your birthday!

07:47.268 --> 07:49.594
I baked cupcakes and I
totally forgot about them.

07:49.619 --> 07:51.553
When do you have time to bake?

07:51.613 --> 07:53.380
I know, I needed something to relax me.

07:53.405 --> 07:55.850
You know what could help you to relax?
Sleeping.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.844
- Did you do something special?
- Mel threw the annual barbecue.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.458
Some friends, some family,
some coconut cream pie.

08:01.483 --> 08:03.207
- Oh, that's nice.
- It was.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.818
You know, usual suspects.

08:04.843 --> 08:07.395
We should shake things up and
let's go for drinks tonight.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.138
- A kid in four is waiting for you.
- Okay?

08:12.850 --> 08:14.283
How'd this happened?

08:14.633 --> 08:17.184
Rolled it during soccer
practice, and wiped out.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.605
Could've walked it off, but
Coach forced me to come.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.690
My mom's on her way.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.110
You should consider a beard.

08:25.426 --> 08:28.070
Beards are in. Plus it'll
help with your chin.

08:28.347 --> 08:31.408
Okay, good to know.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.936
How's the pain on a scale from 1 to 10?

08:34.626 --> 08:36.227
Six.

08:37.429 --> 08:38.996
Eight when you do that!

08:39.275 --> 08:43.461
Well, it's probably a
sprain, but we'll X-ray.

08:43.836 --> 08:45.623
Either way, you're
gonna have to rest it.

08:45.698 --> 08:47.466
But playoffs are coming up.

08:47.491 --> 08:48.773
But you gotta think long-term.

08:48.798 --> 08:51.052
You push it now, it could
only make it worse.

08:52.244 --> 08:55.863
And uh, I'll get a nurse in
here disinfect these scrapes.

08:56.123 --> 08:59.223
- Does it hurt when I press?
- No. All good.

09:00.221 --> 09:01.789
What happened to your ribs?

09:01.817 --> 09:03.652
Nothing. They're fine.

09:06.174 --> 09:07.842
Danny is binding.

09:08.072 --> 09:11.475
If it wasn't on the chart, I'd never
have known he was born a girl.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.900
What did he say?

09:12.925 --> 09:14.066
Not much,

09:14.091 --> 09:16.852
he clammed up when I asked
about the tensor bandage.

09:17.768 --> 09:19.433
I'm worried he's cutting
off circulation.

09:19.458 --> 09:20.622
What's the protocol?

09:20.744 --> 09:22.633
Is this your first transgender patient?

09:22.658 --> 09:25.239
No, I saw some adults when
I was doing residency,

09:25.264 --> 09:26.991
but never someone this young.

09:27.016 --> 09:29.965
But I'm just treating this
kid for a sprained ankle.

09:30.132 --> 09:33.092
He may not have anyone he
trusts to help him with this.

09:40.027 --> 09:42.128
Sorry.

09:42.406 --> 09:45.152
Sir, you really have to
hold still, okay? Ah!!

09:45.177 --> 09:47.105
Uh, nurse?

09:56.547 --> 10:00.621
Ugh... So stupid. I should've
had security there.

10:01.512 --> 10:02.957
Dr. Curtis, are you okay?

10:02.982 --> 10:06.852
Yeah, just blood splatter
from a displaced IV.

10:06.877 --> 10:09.052
The patient is an intravenous user.

10:09.077 --> 10:10.878
You need to fill out an incident report.

10:10.903 --> 10:14.472
Get blood work on him,
including HIV, Hep B, Hep C.

10:14.497 --> 10:16.622
I want you to start PEP immediately.

10:16.647 --> 10:19.348
Uh, I have surgery today, so...

10:19.373 --> 10:21.016
Not anymore.

10:21.816 --> 10:24.270
- I can draw your blood.
- I'll go to the lab.

10:31.356 --> 10:34.967
Blood work is normal, as is your ECG,
so no evidence of a heart attack.

10:34.992 --> 10:36.526
Then what was I feeling?

10:36.551 --> 10:39.620
You're tachycardic, which means
you have an elevated heart rate.

10:39.645 --> 10:40.946
Is that serious?

10:40.971 --> 10:43.337
We need to determine
the underlying cause.

10:43.362 --> 10:44.814
Do you still feel numbness?

10:44.839 --> 10:46.352
It... It comes and goes,

10:46.377 --> 10:48.544
along with this splitting headache.

10:48.732 --> 10:52.763
Well, the next step is an echo
and then a stress test, but...

10:52.788 --> 10:54.075
What's happening to me?

10:54.100 --> 10:55.531
Kevin?

10:58.291 --> 11:00.786
I need help over here!

11:02.629 --> 11:05.451
You were saying something
about an X-ray?

11:06.862 --> 11:09.420
We'll get you one right away,
now just give me a minute.

11:18.106 --> 11:21.473
Kevin Gomes, the heart patient.
Is he in the echo lab?

11:21.922 --> 11:24.684
Uh no, you sent him for a
CT to rule out stroke.

11:25.127 --> 11:26.460
When?

11:26.485 --> 11:28.689
About an hour ago.

12:25.140 --> 12:27.742
Arnold, have you seen
my patient Kevin Gomes?

12:27.767 --> 12:29.467
Porters are bringing him back down.

12:29.492 --> 12:31.059
Why, thought you lost him?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.003
No, just uh...

12:38.420 --> 12:40.187
Hey, you forget something bud?

12:40.364 --> 12:42.991
- You left this in the lounge.
- Thank you.

12:51.174 --> 12:53.774
I'm Amanda Gomes, you left me a message?

12:54.465 --> 12:57.800
Uh, Dr. Hamed. You're Kevin
Gomes's emergency contact?

12:57.825 --> 12:59.921
His sister, yes. Is he okay?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.371
I'm just about to pick up
his latest test results.

13:02.396 --> 13:04.925
Did Kevin ask you to call me?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.714
It's protocol when somebody
loses consciousness.

13:07.851 --> 13:09.816
He lost consciousness?

13:10.232 --> 13:12.125
What happened? Where is he?

13:12.476 --> 13:15.997
Um, if you check at the nurse's desk,
they'll be able to direct you.

13:16.022 --> 13:17.673
I'll be there shortly.

13:21.326 --> 13:23.178
Why did you even come here?

13:23.243 --> 13:24.420
I want to help you!

13:24.445 --> 13:26.435
You being here only makes things worse!

13:26.460 --> 13:29.389
If you really want to
help me, you'll leave.

13:31.045 --> 13:32.729
Take care of him.

13:36.871 --> 13:38.683
You called my sister?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.847
You collapsed. We had her on
file from a prior visit...

13:41.872 --> 13:44.040
You shouldn't have called her.
My family is...

13:44.613 --> 13:46.661
They don't know how to
handle this kind of thing.

13:47.485 --> 13:49.610
Well, good news, your
CT came back clear.

13:49.635 --> 13:51.135
No sign of a stroke.

13:51.399 --> 13:53.867
But we still don't
know why I passed out?

13:54.672 --> 13:57.270
It could be a cardiogenic syncope.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.374
Sometimes with an irregular heartbeat,

13:59.440 --> 14:01.835
your blood pressure drops suddenly.

14:02.069 --> 14:03.667
Is your headache worse?

14:03.692 --> 14:08.223
Like a dull creeping ache
across the back of my skull.

14:08.883 --> 14:10.753
Could you have missed something?

14:10.778 --> 14:12.750
Doctors make mistakes
all the time, right?

14:12.829 --> 14:15.464
Uh, we'll order an MRI.

14:15.821 --> 14:19.442
It can detect subtleties
that sometimes a CT can't.

14:20.744 --> 14:23.378
Four weeks. No training.

14:23.594 --> 14:25.690
Seriously? That's like forever.

14:25.715 --> 14:27.867
It'll fly by before you know it.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.871
But listen...

14:31.789 --> 14:35.125
When you rewrap your other tensor,

14:35.443 --> 14:36.919
go easy.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.844
Too tight, and it can
cause other problems.

14:40.642 --> 14:42.509
Too loose, and they'll still show.

14:42.534 --> 14:45.017
You can buy compression chest binders.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.712
They are easier on your skin.

14:46.737 --> 14:49.065
Still, you shouldn't wear them
more than eight hours a day.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.355
Yeah, but...

14:50.591 --> 14:52.926
you need a credit card
to buy them online.

14:52.994 --> 14:55.423
So your parents don't
know that you're...

14:55.448 --> 14:57.002
A boy?

14:59.103 --> 15:01.000
They're fine with the pronouns

15:01.025 --> 15:04.384
and keeping my hair short, and
wearing boy's clothes, but...

15:04.973 --> 15:06.507
that's about it.

15:06.532 --> 15:08.266
They don't know that you bind.

15:08.384 --> 15:11.161
I don't know, we don't talk about it.

15:13.273 --> 15:15.307
I know about gender dysphoria.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.502
I've seen a therapist a
couple times for it.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.169
Okay.

15:22.123 --> 15:24.382
Is there anything I can do to help?

15:24.725 --> 15:26.593
I want top surgery.

15:31.171 --> 15:34.441
Okay, Danny wants a double mastectomy.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.090
He asked you to help him get it?

15:36.341 --> 15:38.956
Thirteen's pretty young to make
a call on gender reassignment.

15:39.135 --> 15:41.771
So, you're on the conservative
side of the medical?

15:41.796 --> 15:43.129
The kid is still growing.

15:43.154 --> 15:46.183
And we don't have proper
long-term studies on hormones.

15:46.287 --> 15:48.591
If he's considering it,
he should know the risks.

15:48.616 --> 15:51.749
Hmm, well, it's a little outside
the lines of emergency medicine.

15:51.774 --> 15:53.607
You sure you want to wade into this?

15:53.632 --> 15:56.034
I want to make sure he has
the support he needs.

15:56.457 --> 16:00.322
When the mother comes in, I'd...
I'd like to talk to her.

16:01.157 --> 16:03.025
Well, let me know what you need.

16:06.271 --> 16:09.271
Does your patient know
what triggered this event?

16:09.411 --> 16:11.111
He thinks so.

16:11.980 --> 16:13.732
And you said he lost time.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.209
About an hour's worth.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.469
He can't remember
anything over that span.

16:17.592 --> 16:20.427
Well, sounds like a dissociative event.

16:21.172 --> 16:22.886
Right.

16:23.056 --> 16:25.667
He retraced his steps,

16:25.692 --> 16:28.763
and he functioned perfectly throughout.
No one even noticed.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.248
With dissociation, the patient's
emotional centre detaches

16:32.282 --> 16:35.284
but his decision-making and
instincts remain the same.

16:36.048 --> 16:38.610
Is this something he has a history of?

16:39.617 --> 16:42.140
Sometimes he says he zones out.

16:42.165 --> 16:43.866
But no, nothing like this.

16:44.524 --> 16:46.617
Normally when I'm being
referred to a patient,

16:46.642 --> 16:48.437
there's a chart of some kind.

16:48.957 --> 16:51.659
- I'm just gathering information.
- Mm.

16:51.773 --> 16:55.220
You said you have experience with PTSD.

16:55.245 --> 16:58.080
Yes, I do, and with
post-traumatic stress injuries,

16:58.105 --> 16:59.906
the only way out is through.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.135
You should encourage your
patient to get therapy.

17:03.818 --> 17:05.519
And if he's not ready for that?

17:05.544 --> 17:07.905
Well, does he have a
good support system?

17:07.930 --> 17:09.564
Family, friends?

17:11.049 --> 17:12.983
He would rather not involve them.

17:13.008 --> 17:15.690
Mm. Well, maybe he should start.

17:32.463 --> 17:35.184
Why are you looking at the
discharged patients' files?

17:35.209 --> 17:38.504
I'm checking to make sure
there's nothing I missed today.

17:39.777 --> 17:42.331
Sometimes it... it all feels
like it all blends together

17:42.356 --> 17:45.049
Mm. I'd trade you if I could.
I remember every patient.

17:45.074 --> 17:46.658
Every detail. It's like a curse.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.674
Can't remember what I had
for breakfast, though.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.605
I can help you review if you want.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.270
If you're worried you missed something.

17:55.295 --> 17:57.229
Doesn't look like I did.

17:57.254 --> 17:59.111
Did you get your antivirals?

17:59.136 --> 18:00.157
Check.

18:00.182 --> 18:01.852
Why are you still here?
You can't see patients.

18:01.877 --> 18:04.145
- I have files to finish.
- We can cover that.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.213
Why? If I have something, I'm
gonna have it at home too.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.440
Hey, your results are
in from Respiratory.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.704
Perfect.

18:12.729 --> 18:15.208
- Absolutely not.
- Jessica.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.271
Last night was a grind. I came
in for O2 and an all-clear.

18:18.296 --> 18:19.491
I'm not sidelining myself.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.227
Jessica, you may have COPD.

18:21.252 --> 18:23.412
You said my chest X-ray
was clear of cancer.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.532
That's good enough for me.

18:24.557 --> 18:26.618
Your lung capacity is
significantly reduced.

18:26.643 --> 18:28.133
Ignoring this could actually kill you.

18:28.158 --> 18:30.492
- Well, so could a fire.
- Listen, it's just a few tests!

18:30.517 --> 18:32.687
It's a consult with one
of our respirologists.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.289
Let me help you get this under control.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.742
Look, I know you're doing your
job, but I gotta do mine.

18:36.767 --> 18:40.570
My dad did this job 'til he was
50, I'm not about to give it up.

18:40.595 --> 18:42.400
Well, if you leave
against medical advice,

18:42.425 --> 18:45.602
I need you to sign something that
says you understand the risks.

18:47.387 --> 18:48.558
No problem.

18:48.876 --> 18:51.597
I'm sorry, he shouldn't
have gotten you involved.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.807
- We've been through this.
- Eighteen is too long to wait!

18:55.832 --> 18:57.734
We had a long talk
with his pediatrician,

18:57.759 --> 19:00.455
and we all agreed we won't
even consider surgery until

19:00.480 --> 19:02.853
- Danny is an adult.
- I don't agree!

19:03.264 --> 19:04.564
What do you think?

19:04.734 --> 19:07.990
I think holding off on
a surgical procedure

19:08.270 --> 19:09.412
is a wise decision.

19:09.529 --> 19:12.123
- You're on her side?!
- I'm on your side.

19:12.474 --> 19:14.575
Surgery is a big commitment.

19:14.643 --> 19:16.810
- Your body is still changing.
- That's the point!

19:16.835 --> 19:19.634
- I need it to stop!
- Danny, you're thirteen!

19:19.796 --> 19:21.530
I know what I want!

19:21.555 --> 19:24.079
- You pass as a boy.
- With breasts!

19:24.369 --> 19:26.611
They won't let me play for
the guy's soccer team.

19:26.636 --> 19:28.134
What if this is a phase?

19:28.159 --> 19:29.784
You think I'm just gonna get over it?!

19:29.809 --> 19:31.744
Yes! You might!

19:33.304 --> 19:36.963
Look, when we get home,
we can talk some more.

19:36.988 --> 19:38.308
Okay?

19:40.050 --> 19:41.386
You don't believe me

19:41.557 --> 19:43.097
Come on Danny.

19:43.406 --> 19:45.065
No one is saying that.

19:45.090 --> 19:47.024
She just did.

19:49.446 --> 19:51.112
You're all the same.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.175
- Good night, sir.
- You ordered a CT, an ECG

19:57.200 --> 19:59.683
and an MRI for the patient in two?

19:59.935 --> 20:02.058
Along with Kevin's racing heart,

20:02.083 --> 20:03.554
headaches, and slurred speech,

20:03.579 --> 20:06.430
he's also presenting with
severe abdominal pain.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.222
The nurses say he's
vomited several times.

20:08.247 --> 20:10.482
I looked at the MRI. He
hasn't had a stroke.

20:10.507 --> 20:12.777
- Mm-hmm.
- You were expecting that?

20:12.802 --> 20:14.480
Does that mean you have a theory?

20:15.141 --> 20:18.141
There may be nothing
wrong with him at all.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.501
Keep talking.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.305
I think Kevin's tachycardia's
brought on by a stress reaction.

20:24.469 --> 20:26.217
And yet he's still here.

20:26.373 --> 20:28.374
Are you saying you want
me to send him home?

20:28.502 --> 20:31.279
I'm saying you better have a
very good reason if you don't.

20:56.619 --> 20:58.320
Are you going somewhere?

20:58.421 --> 21:00.549
Daneesha's, remember?

21:00.574 --> 21:02.079
You said I can sleep over.

21:02.104 --> 21:03.875
It's Friday already?

21:05.339 --> 21:08.506
I thought we could make
our own pizzas again

21:09.346 --> 21:11.414
She asked for me to eat there.

21:11.439 --> 21:13.140
Her cousins are coming over too.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.803
That will be fun.

21:15.564 --> 21:18.038
Will you be okay alone?

21:18.115 --> 21:20.058
You think I need a babysitter?

21:20.483 --> 21:24.121
Only sometimes. How was work?

21:24.146 --> 21:27.107
It was fine. I'll walk you over.

21:29.510 --> 21:31.441
Look, the next one's on you.

21:40.067 --> 21:41.968
Hey! You made it!

21:42.958 --> 21:45.334
He's the best.

21:46.917 --> 21:48.587
Happy birthday.

21:49.234 --> 21:51.924
It's a Baharat. A spice
mix we use at home.

21:51.949 --> 21:53.449
Amira toasts it.

21:53.474 --> 21:56.144
Thanks, man. Uh Aiden Miller.

21:56.169 --> 21:58.337
Surgeon. We were in the
same year in med school.

21:58.362 --> 21:59.562
Bashir.

21:59.794 --> 22:01.600
Go, big guy.

22:02.102 --> 22:05.339
Mm. You haven't changed a bit.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.908
That is not true.

22:06.933 --> 22:09.735
Says the guy who's wearing the
same khakis he wore to graduation

22:09.760 --> 22:11.976
When I find pants that
fit, I stick with them!

22:12.001 --> 22:13.783
There's nothing wrong with that.
Am I right?

22:13.808 --> 22:15.658
- No, he's right.
- I'm right.

22:15.683 --> 22:17.642
You sure you don't want something?

22:17.667 --> 22:19.467
Early surgery tomorrow, so...

22:19.591 --> 22:21.337
So you're not coming over later?

22:21.545 --> 22:23.705
Don't you have your son?

22:23.730 --> 22:25.074
He's with his mom.

22:25.099 --> 22:26.863
Can I get a soda with lime, please.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.926
Oh, so y'all are gonna
make me drink alone?

22:31.097 --> 22:33.841
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

22:35.032 --> 22:36.887
Hey, hey, hey!

22:36.912 --> 22:39.263
It's my favourite not-a-couple!

22:39.386 --> 22:41.891
Wait, so you're here together?

22:42.334 --> 22:45.303
That means you're here together.

22:45.328 --> 22:46.561
Right?

22:46.586 --> 22:49.189
Are you still thinking about
your fake patient fake dying?

22:49.399 --> 22:51.367
No, no, no. I've let that go.

22:51.392 --> 22:52.693
Oh.

22:53.036 --> 22:54.434
Okay, no I haven't.

22:54.459 --> 22:57.633
But I'm also thinking about
this firefighter I saw today.

22:57.658 --> 23:01.238
COPD. And I tried getting her to
see all the risks of ignoring it,

23:01.263 --> 23:04.324
and she just discharged herself
to run right back into the fire.

23:04.567 --> 23:06.001
Sounds like no one I know.

23:06.026 --> 23:08.512
So basically you went from
obsessing over a fake patient,

23:08.537 --> 23:09.837
to obsessing over a real one,

23:09.862 --> 23:11.840
both of which are outside
of your control?

23:11.865 --> 23:14.734
I gave her all the intel, it
wasn't enough to stop her.

23:17.247 --> 23:20.304
Joanie! The paramedics
came out tonight too?

23:21.023 --> 23:22.515
I got you.

23:25.897 --> 23:28.563
How did I lose my wallet already?

23:28.631 --> 23:31.189
Sign of someone who's
having a good birthday.

23:31.467 --> 23:33.481
- Yeah.
- How old exactly?

23:33.506 --> 23:34.926
Thirty-two.

23:34.963 --> 23:37.207
One more year, and I've outlasted Jesus.

23:37.232 --> 23:38.973
Hey, what do you think?

23:38.998 --> 23:40.298
Should I...

23:40.835 --> 23:43.145
- Should I grow a beard?
- Like Jesus?

23:43.170 --> 23:46.856
Ha! I was thinking more like...
like a lumberjack.

23:46.881 --> 23:49.499
Yeah! Yeah, I think you could handle it.

23:49.524 --> 23:50.992
Thank you.

23:58.647 --> 24:03.218
One more drink, and they'll cross
over from lubricated to morose.

24:05.731 --> 24:07.465
Is that why you're hiding?

24:07.490 --> 24:10.895
I always hoping that a night out
will help with a tough day.

24:11.108 --> 24:12.775
Do you want to talk about it?

24:12.842 --> 24:14.774
I'm really better a listener.

24:16.739 --> 24:19.733
But you're not much of a talker.

24:21.061 --> 24:22.740
In that case...

24:27.119 --> 24:28.706
Should we go?

24:36.049 --> 24:37.848
Organic...

24:38.645 --> 24:40.212
fair trade...

24:40.616 --> 24:43.470
dark orange.

24:43.964 --> 24:46.139
- You remembered.
- Mm.

24:55.331 --> 24:57.275
That's it?

24:59.382 --> 25:00.892
That's all I want.

25:03.507 --> 25:04.895
Mm.

25:09.843 --> 25:12.207
Why don't you stay the night?

25:14.444 --> 25:16.002
We don't do that.

25:19.061 --> 25:21.189
You could leave Eric, you know?

25:23.089 --> 25:24.474
For you?

25:24.617 --> 25:27.419
The workaholic with a hole in his head?

25:33.756 --> 25:35.223
Get some rest.

26:36.373 --> 26:38.146
Hey. Sorry to call you in so early.

26:38.171 --> 26:40.274
It's fine, Arnold, I asked you to.
What's happening?

26:40.554 --> 26:42.589
Uh, Kevin took a turn for the worse.

26:47.342 --> 26:48.952
I know you said to send him home,

26:48.977 --> 26:50.797
but he could be having
an aortic dissection,

26:50.822 --> 26:52.618
which, if went untreated,
could be fatal.

26:52.643 --> 26:54.441
Because of the widened mediastinum?

26:54.466 --> 26:57.313
And because dissection already
mimics everything I've tested for.

26:57.338 --> 27:00.907
- Heart attack, stroke...
- Get him a CTA to confirm stat.

27:00.932 --> 27:02.852
Put cardio-thoracics on standby.

27:02.877 --> 27:05.404
If you're right, every second counts.

27:07.942 --> 27:09.741
Dr. Hunter!

27:09.897 --> 27:11.951
Paula? What, what happened?

27:11.976 --> 27:14.412
I found him trembling on the floor,

27:14.437 --> 27:16.571
he was burning up! He
passed out on the way over!

27:16.596 --> 27:19.209
Hey. Danny? Can you hear me?

27:19.234 --> 27:20.835
Did he take anything?

27:20.860 --> 27:23.285
He said he bought testosterone
off some guy at a gym.

27:23.310 --> 27:25.305
Would it do that to him?

27:25.330 --> 27:27.415
We need to get him inside.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.720
Mike, Mike! Bring a chair!

27:30.926 --> 27:32.527
Just take a step back.

27:37.812 --> 27:39.937
Alright...

27:44.116 --> 27:46.351
I need a resus, stat!

27:47.726 --> 27:49.308
Code pink! Trauma bay!

27:49.333 --> 27:50.704
Heart rate elevated.

27:50.729 --> 27:53.798
Hyperthermic, temp is 39 and rising.

27:53.823 --> 27:55.164
Cooling packs.

27:55.189 --> 27:57.235
He may have ingested some
form of amphetamine.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.736
Start 1 mg Lorazepam.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.210
Rate's spiking! Temp won't stabilize!

28:01.235 --> 28:03.462
Normal, give me that syringe.

28:11.115 --> 28:13.137
Can I get a flesh?

28:17.616 --> 28:19.602
Okay, okay.

28:22.404 --> 28:24.941
110... 106...

28:27.481 --> 28:31.197
100... 99!

28:31.453 --> 28:33.614
Okay, start fluids, get a CBC,

28:33.639 --> 28:35.680
lytes, and a CK to check
if there's rhabdo.

28:35.705 --> 28:37.102
Tell lab to rush a full tox screen.

28:37.127 --> 28:39.039
- Okay.
- Oh, my baby!

28:45.612 --> 28:48.140
And finally after every test that I ran,

28:48.165 --> 28:50.272
my patient's CTA is normal.

28:50.883 --> 28:52.803
So what's next, Dr. Hamed?

28:53.007 --> 28:55.100
Full-body PET scan?

28:55.667 --> 28:58.135
A course of prophylactic chemotherapy?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.402
There is nothing physically
wrong with Kevin Gomes.

29:01.466 --> 29:03.100
You knew that ages ago.

29:03.262 --> 29:04.996
I could have missed something.

29:05.135 --> 29:07.504
You've never doubted your
instinct before. Why now?

29:08.151 --> 29:10.186
Why do you think you've
missed something?

29:11.241 --> 29:14.709
Next time this happens,
don't keep it to yourself.

29:14.996 --> 29:16.545
Come and talk to me.

29:18.336 --> 29:20.369
Your labs aren't back yet,

29:20.674 --> 29:23.658
but your vitals have stabilized.
You're doing good.

29:24.071 --> 29:25.837
What do you care?

29:27.317 --> 29:28.651
I care.

29:29.940 --> 29:32.441
Your mom cares too. We all do.

29:34.790 --> 29:37.158
If she did, she'd do something.

29:38.349 --> 29:39.970
Your mom is scared.

29:41.094 --> 29:43.159
I saw the way she looked
when she brought you in,

29:43.184 --> 29:45.206
she loves you very much, Danny.

29:45.355 --> 29:47.690
Not enough to let me have surgery.

29:48.676 --> 29:51.245
Mastectomy is a big deal

29:52.711 --> 29:54.229
Look at me.

29:55.439 --> 29:56.909
What do you see?

29:59.096 --> 30:00.370
Right.

30:02.347 --> 30:04.214
Do you know what it's like?

30:05.563 --> 30:07.596
I feel caught in between.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.250
I just wanna be like
the rest of the guys.

30:13.856 --> 30:16.320
I can't live a lie

30:16.607 --> 30:18.469
another four years.

30:25.348 --> 30:27.351
Are they in yet? Your results.

30:27.376 --> 30:28.445
I haven't checked.

30:28.470 --> 30:30.287
June, it's okay if you're
worried, you know.

30:30.312 --> 30:31.563
- I'm fine.
- Incoming!

30:31.588 --> 30:32.831
Woman collapsed in a fire.

30:32.856 --> 30:34.524
That's all I know.

30:36.015 --> 30:38.531
Female, 33, unconscious.

30:38.556 --> 30:41.187
- Is she a firefighter?
- No, a civilian.

30:41.212 --> 30:43.148
Wendy Newman, hypotensive.

30:43.173 --> 30:46.320
Penetrating trauma to the chest.
80 on 40.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.102
She fell through a window
during an apartment fire,

30:49.127 --> 30:51.000
and the glass cut deep.

30:52.591 --> 30:53.836
Pericardial effusion.

30:53.861 --> 30:56.195
She needs a bilateral chest
tubes and a sternotomy.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.187
- Call OR.
- Pressure's 70 over 30.

30:58.212 --> 31:00.478
There's no time, that's a
penetrating wound to the heart.

31:00.503 --> 31:02.869
- You're saying she needs a thoracotomy?
- She needs it now.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.683
- I'll page Atwater.
- I've got it.

31:04.708 --> 31:07.390
ED thoracotomies have less than
a five percent success rate

31:07.415 --> 31:09.556
We don't control the odds, doctor.

31:09.581 --> 31:11.315
Just have to face them.

31:11.584 --> 31:13.801
Dr. Curtis, you can't help,
so why are you here?

31:13.826 --> 31:15.447
I can help talk Mags through it.

31:15.472 --> 31:17.574
Okay, let's do it.

31:19.903 --> 31:23.035
- Sats are dropping!
- I'm going to bag.

31:24.171 --> 31:25.905
Now would be a good time!

31:26.312 --> 31:28.703
Alright, let's get the
left arm out of the way.

31:28.728 --> 31:30.343
Prep the chest.

31:38.304 --> 31:39.902
Alright, so,

31:39.927 --> 31:42.450
you're gonna make an incision
between the 5th intercostal space,

31:42.475 --> 31:44.242
from the sternum to the bed.

31:56.453 --> 31:58.317
Scissors.

32:02.228 --> 32:03.996
Ready to open the chest.

32:04.263 --> 32:05.812
Alright.

32:06.598 --> 32:08.710
Just pretend I'm Dr. Curtis.

32:09.294 --> 32:12.042
When's the last time you
got your hands dirty?

32:12.067 --> 32:13.585
On three.

32:13.921 --> 32:16.256
One, two, three.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.425
She needs blood.

32:18.450 --> 32:20.151
O-Negative. Four units.

32:20.176 --> 32:22.763
Activate MTP and 2 grams of TXA.

32:22.788 --> 32:24.757
Keep talking, Dr. Curtis.

32:24.782 --> 32:26.500
Okay, you're gonna need
to make an incision

32:26.525 --> 32:28.499
in the pericardium from apex to base.

32:28.524 --> 32:30.168
Okay, let's do it.

32:31.274 --> 32:33.772
Just medial to the phrenic nerve.

32:33.933 --> 32:35.525
She's arresting!

32:35.743 --> 32:37.211
Don't think, just cut.

32:37.236 --> 32:39.460
- Is the clamp secure?
- Mm-hmm.

32:40.248 --> 32:43.115
- Arnold, what's the count?
- She's been down 10 seconds!

32:46.486 --> 32:47.999
Do you see anything?

32:48.186 --> 32:51.053
A single cardiac wound. I
can plug it with my finger.

32:51.078 --> 32:53.421
Good, do it.

32:54.603 --> 32:57.351
And BP's rising, 80 60.

33:00.002 --> 33:02.301
Needle driver. 1.0 sutures.

33:04.741 --> 33:09.350
You rolled with an imperfect
situation and you had her back.

33:09.959 --> 33:12.979
It's good to see that when
it's not a training exercise,

33:13.275 --> 33:15.452
you two remember what we taught you.

33:15.477 --> 33:16.858
Good work.

33:33.981 --> 33:35.551
Good to see you got home okay.

33:35.576 --> 33:36.709
Hey.

33:36.788 --> 33:39.256
Was I supposed to text you?

33:41.825 --> 33:44.261
I'm glad we ran into
each other last night.

33:45.084 --> 33:47.395
- I had fun.
- Me too.

33:48.121 --> 33:50.683
It was good not talking with you.

33:58.087 --> 34:01.986
Our family doctor called it
somatic symptom disorder.

34:02.164 --> 34:05.337
He said Kevin can actually
feel the symptoms,

34:05.362 --> 34:07.262
even though they're just in his head.

34:07.287 --> 34:09.088
How long has he been like this?

34:09.112 --> 34:10.914
It started young.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.998
Always finding some new
thing wrong with him.

34:14.621 --> 34:16.589
Mom and Dad would rush
him to the doctor,

34:16.614 --> 34:18.219
but he was never really sick.

34:18.310 --> 34:21.025
- They didn't get him help?
- He hated therapy.

34:21.205 --> 34:23.272
Our parents did their best, but...

34:24.106 --> 34:26.172
he only got worse after he moved out.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.922
Are there any specific triggers?

34:28.947 --> 34:30.243
When things change,

34:30.268 --> 34:32.135
or he has setbacks,

34:32.237 --> 34:34.105
it could be anything.

34:34.911 --> 34:38.168
And then anyone who doesn't
believe him is gone.

34:38.193 --> 34:39.694
Including you.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.415
Why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

34:43.513 --> 34:44.880
You said he collapsed.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.145
What if this time, something
really was wrong?

34:47.170 --> 34:49.617
I couldn't be the reason you
didn't look closely enough.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.953
You saw what happened when
I tried to talk to him.

34:52.731 --> 34:54.297
I love my brother,

34:54.612 --> 34:57.207
and I feel so bad knowing
he's in pain, but...

34:57.883 --> 35:00.151
The second he decides he wants help,

35:00.589 --> 35:02.714
I'll be there to support him.

35:03.229 --> 35:04.965
Labs came back.

35:05.079 --> 35:08.501
The shot of testosterone you bought
was laced with an amphetamine.

35:08.562 --> 35:10.897
It was a large dose. And
that's what caused you to OD.

35:10.922 --> 35:13.223
Why would someone sell a kid
something so dangerous?

35:13.248 --> 35:15.688
Guys think using it gives
them a better workout.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.187
It doesn't.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.682
What were you thinking?!

35:19.715 --> 35:22.483
You won't let me start T or get surgery.

35:22.508 --> 35:24.259
Danny, please. Let's not get into this.

35:24.284 --> 35:25.603
I did do some digging,

35:25.839 --> 35:27.603
and there is a gender clinic in the city

35:27.628 --> 35:31.337
who specializes in building action
plans for transgendered youth.

35:31.362 --> 35:32.790
Action plans? What does that mean?

35:32.815 --> 35:34.126
Like surgery?

35:34.413 --> 35:35.782
There are interim options.

35:35.807 --> 35:37.719
It's a bit late to put
you on puberty blockers,

35:37.744 --> 35:40.470
but you don't have to do a full
cross-hormone to see an effect.

35:40.495 --> 35:42.162
So, hormone therapy.

35:43.192 --> 35:46.006
Which means my breasts
will stop growing?

35:47.490 --> 35:49.257
I can refer you,

35:49.504 --> 35:51.553
if it's something you'd
like to consider.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.415
Please, Mom.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.140
I want this

35:59.061 --> 36:01.815
No more buying hormones off the street.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.692
I cannot go through this again, Danny.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.987
I'm sorry.

36:08.570 --> 36:10.155
I promise.

36:13.641 --> 36:14.948
Okay.

36:15.149 --> 36:17.050
We'll hear what they
have to say together,

36:17.075 --> 36:19.003
and we'll take it from there.

36:20.256 --> 36:21.723
I won't change my mind.

36:21.748 --> 36:23.712
I'm not promising to change mine.

36:24.565 --> 36:26.125
Just...

36:26.375 --> 36:30.009
one step at a time, okay baby?

36:31.328 --> 36:33.777
Will you be disappointed in me

36:33.802 --> 36:36.141
if this isn't a phase?

36:37.986 --> 36:39.977
Danny, you're my kid.

36:41.744 --> 36:43.273
You're my son.

36:46.471 --> 36:49.279
I love you no matter what.

36:52.044 --> 36:53.889
You know who you are.

36:55.468 --> 36:57.162
That's pretty amazing.

37:04.168 --> 37:05.701
Uh...

37:06.926 --> 37:08.423
The results are up.

37:08.448 --> 37:10.169
I'm gonna... Can you...?

37:10.194 --> 37:13.260
I can't. I need you to look at them.

37:21.768 --> 37:23.453
Jesus, it's not Moby Dick.

37:23.478 --> 37:25.356
It's all clear.

37:58.954 --> 38:01.304
You're gonna tell me there's
nothing wrong with me,

38:01.329 --> 38:02.864
that's why they had me get dressed.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.423
Actually, I'm not.

38:06.101 --> 38:07.669
You're worried about being sick,

38:07.694 --> 38:09.352
so your body is manifesting symptoms.

38:09.377 --> 38:11.985
No, I have a heart problem,

38:12.010 --> 38:13.946
it's... it's real, I know it.

38:13.971 --> 38:15.134
I know it feels real.

38:15.159 --> 38:16.813
You're just like the rest of them!

38:16.838 --> 38:17.967
It's all in my head!

38:17.992 --> 38:19.977
This? Coming into the
emergency department,

38:20.002 --> 38:22.055
isn't going to stop this from happening.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.391
You have no idea what it's like.

38:24.416 --> 38:26.784
I'm scared I'm gonna die all the time.

38:26.809 --> 38:28.410
There are people who you can speak to.

38:28.435 --> 38:30.656
I can refer you to our staff
psychiatrist, Dr. Mitchell.

38:30.681 --> 38:33.799
I've talked to shrinks before.
They do nothing!

38:33.824 --> 38:36.194
Because, Kevin, you
have to want that help.

38:36.219 --> 38:38.119
You have to accept that you need it.

38:38.144 --> 38:40.588
- No, you are not listening!
- I'm listening.

38:40.613 --> 38:43.292
Forget it! Just forget it!

38:55.327 --> 38:57.030
There he is!

38:57.685 --> 39:00.242
Ah, I'm such a lightweight.

39:00.323 --> 39:02.291
Are you still good for later?

39:02.530 --> 39:05.019
Listen, maybe I didn't mention this,

39:05.044 --> 39:07.251
but I'm married.

39:07.321 --> 39:10.017
You told me. She's a real estate agent.

39:10.234 --> 39:12.530
You showed me pictures of your kids.

39:12.555 --> 39:15.174
What does that have to do with
you coming on a ride along?

39:16.919 --> 39:19.178
I can't today.

39:19.555 --> 39:21.422
But thanks anyway.

39:21.447 --> 39:24.014
Well, if you find yourself stuck
here bored some other weekend,

39:24.039 --> 39:26.040
I usually work on Saturdays.

39:26.470 --> 39:28.150
Offer's open.

39:32.358 --> 39:34.159
Is he doing alright?

39:34.422 --> 39:36.423
Your patient who wanted to transition.

39:36.448 --> 39:39.156
Better. He still wants surgery,

39:39.181 --> 39:41.227
but he's relieved there's a way forward.

39:41.252 --> 39:43.775
Thank you for organizing that
referral to the gender clinic.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.163
How does your family cope with
you being away this much?

39:46.188 --> 39:47.755
We make it work.

39:48.431 --> 39:53.509
You know, there's a full-time position
in Emerg pediatrics opening up.

39:53.534 --> 39:56.215
If you want to apply, you'd
have my recommendation.

39:56.863 --> 39:59.384
I don't know what to say,

39:59.430 --> 40:00.564
thank you.

40:00.589 --> 40:02.768
I'd have to discuss that with my wife.

40:02.793 --> 40:04.728
Ah, maybe they could move here?

40:05.017 --> 40:07.425
The kind of experience you get
at a city hospital like this,

40:07.450 --> 40:09.135
you're not gonna find that back home.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.314
Could be an exciting new chapter.

40:26.744 --> 40:29.146
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:35.164 --> 40:36.457
You okay?

40:36.482 --> 40:37.752
Yeah.

40:38.141 --> 40:40.276
Yeah, yeah, I'm just, I'm like...

40:40.301 --> 40:42.302
I'm just, I don't know.

40:42.404 --> 40:44.679
Heard you did a trauma bay thoracotomy?

40:44.704 --> 40:45.961
Yeah.

40:46.289 --> 40:48.601
The patient's recovering in ICU.

40:48.909 --> 40:51.010
Looks like she's gonna pull through.

40:52.218 --> 40:54.732
Saves like that are why we do this.

40:58.403 --> 41:01.105
You know, my mother never wanted me to?

41:01.830 --> 41:03.875
Become a doctor, I mean.

41:04.482 --> 41:06.369
I thought all parents want that.

41:09.562 --> 41:12.332
Mine are always worried
I'll push myself too hard.

41:12.384 --> 41:13.785
Do you?

41:18.153 --> 41:21.060
Well, if there's any another
way to do this job,

41:21.218 --> 41:23.320
I haven't found it.

41:23.891 --> 41:26.224
I spent the last two days
trying to help a patient

41:26.249 --> 41:28.545
who didn't want the
kind of help he needed.

41:29.294 --> 41:31.361
Seems like that's going around.

42:25.366 --> 42:28.234
Did you find what you were
looking for at the library?

42:28.421 --> 42:31.189
Yeah, I did. I finished my homework.

42:31.214 --> 42:32.505
- All of it?
- Yeah.

42:32.530 --> 42:35.415
- Was it hard?
- Mm... It was okay.

42:40.575 --> 42:42.380
Are those our things?

42:45.747 --> 42:47.561
What happened?

42:50.140 --> 42:54.889
