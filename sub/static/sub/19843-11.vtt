00:33.950 --> 00:34.985
Danny.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.962
- Davos?
- You did it, Danny.

00:58.800 --> 00:59.960
The trial of Shou-Lao.

01:01.850 --> 01:02.976
You survived.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.605
You're the Iron Fist.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.956
The people need to meet
the Immortal Weapon.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.002
I'll be your second.

01:37.090 --> 01:38.637
Standing beside you on the pass.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.170
Protectors of K'un-Lun.

01:53.230 --> 01:54.777
It's not what I thought.

01:59.410 --> 02:00.695
It's not what any of us thought.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.649
But you have a duty now.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.035
And we'll face it together.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.632
There's no sign of whoever
was following us. I think we're clear.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.672
We need to leave this place as quickly
as possible and return to K'un-Lun.

04:32.770 --> 04:34.806
Father can re-balance your chi
and restore the Fist.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.560
How is Lei Kung?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.856
- Is he pissed off?
- He's troubled.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.816
He's confused as to why
you would abandon your post

04:46.990 --> 04:48.070
and leave us unprotected.

04:48.370 --> 04:49.359
And, yeah...

04:50.160 --> 04:51.491
he's also very pissed.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.200
How did you even find me, Davos?

04:55.710 --> 04:57.746
I saw you taken by those men
outside that dojo.

04:57.920 --> 05:03.165
- I followed you to the compound.
- No. I meant here. New York.

05:08.550 --> 05:09.551
Here.

05:11.220 --> 05:12.517
You were right about the Internet.

05:14.060 --> 05:15.095
It's very useful.

05:19.230 --> 05:20.561
I saw some equipment
in Bakuto's office.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.817
I think he can track cell phones.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.809
I left mine back at the compound.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.526
Another reason to leave this city
as quickly as possible.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.611
We're not going anywhere. Not yet.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.361
Danny,
the path will not remain open forever.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.650
If we miss it, it will be years
before we can return.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.491
They killed my parents, Davos!

05:38.540 --> 05:40.121
- What?
- The Hand.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.418
They poisoned the pilots.
They... They crashed my plane.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.797
They're the reason for all of this.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.421
But you wanted to be the Iron Fist, Danny.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.466
I am the Iron Fist.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.760
You knew what your duties would be

05:52.850 --> 05:54.215
and you don't get to decide what
that means.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.266
- The hell it doesn't.
- You don't belong here!

05:56.600 --> 05:58.807
If I'm supposed to be the destroyer
of the Hand,

05:59.310 --> 06:02.939
then I should be here,
destroying them where they are.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.021
You're a warrior, like me.

06:07.990 --> 06:09.901
Trained to be the Iron Fist.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.901
But I'm not the Iron Fist.

06:13.490 --> 06:16.209
I wasn't chosen. You were.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.456
And you took it and run.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.166
- I didn't run.
- You were gone, Danny.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.751
There one moment, then nothing.

06:26.130 --> 06:27.461
You failed us.

06:28.510 --> 06:29.545
And for what?

06:31.100 --> 06:32.089
For what?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.347
What do you have to show
for abandoning us?

06:34.640 --> 06:37.768
I have the truth about what happened
to my parents.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.317
And you want to take them all on?

06:45.070 --> 06:46.389
Without the Fist?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.021
Please, Davos.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.110
I need your help.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.997
And once we do this, we go back?

07:06.340 --> 07:07.750
Once the Hand is done...

07:09.340 --> 07:11.046
there'll be nothing left for me here.

07:17.810 --> 07:19.346
Now, I need to get this wound
taken care of.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.556
I know someone who can help.
Someone I trust.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.817
That woman who helped you escape
the compound, who is she?

07:27.940 --> 07:29.020
No one important.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.875
Colleen?

07:52.090 --> 07:53.500
Where did you go?

08:00.230 --> 08:01.470
You know where I went.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.766
I was looking for Danny
after you attacked him.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.259
He's hurt.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.310
He could be bleeding out somewhere.

08:09.650 --> 08:13.029
He attacked us. We had no choice
but to defend ourselves.

08:13.530 --> 08:16.488
He's been told lies about the Hand
his entire life.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.401
He's been programmed to kill us.

08:19.870 --> 08:21.076
That's not who he is.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.036
I wish things could have been different.

08:23.620 --> 08:26.999
I wanted him to overcome his prejudices.
I wanted him to join us.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.834
You wanted me to lie to him.
To spy on him.

08:32.090 --> 08:33.170
He had no one he can trust.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.046
And when he found out
that I was deceiving him,

08:35.300 --> 08:36.631
that I'd been keeping the truth from him,

08:36.800 --> 08:39.382
- what did you think was gonna happen?
- Respect your sensei!

08:49.480 --> 08:53.234
Kevin Michener was orphaned
during the incident.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.527
Becca Yoo's family kicked her out
of the house when she was 15.

08:57.700 --> 09:01.363
They had nowhere to go.
No one to care for them.

09:02.790 --> 09:06.203
This corrupt society was willing
to let them rot on the streets.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.337
They were lost, just like you once were.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.759
But you found them, trained them
you brought them into the Hand.

09:14.130 --> 09:16.007
Now Kevin's interning
in the mayor's office

09:16.180 --> 09:17.829
and Becca's in medical school.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.466
We gave them a purpose.

09:23.390 --> 09:24.425
A family.

09:25.810 --> 09:26.936
I can save Danny, too.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.186
He doesn't understand the good
we're doing.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.645
I can make him see.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.851
The time for understanding is over.

09:33.570 --> 09:37.984
He sees you as one of us,
and that is all he will ever see.

09:39.660 --> 09:44.029
The Iron Fist must be controlled.
The Hand needs him.

09:45.040 --> 09:47.747
When you find him,
you will tell me where he is.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.319
Do you understand?

10:35.460 --> 10:36.461
Hey.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.007
Hey, Danny. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.756
- Who are you?
- Davos.

10:41.930 --> 10:43.386
- He's a friend.
- Are you the healer?

10:44.390 --> 10:45.800
I... What?

10:46.060 --> 10:48.221
We need your help.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.050
Oh, my God.

10:51.230 --> 10:53.061
Come on.

11:00.570 --> 11:01.901
There's something in there.

11:07.910 --> 11:10.322
- Try not to move.
- Okay.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.739
Got it.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.256
Okay.

11:22.220 --> 11:25.053
- Can you stitch me up?
- You're losing too much blood.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.517
- What about healing yourself?
- What?

11:29.350 --> 11:31.477
Like you did with Colleen,
when you burned the poison out?

11:31.770 --> 11:33.306
Just make your hand glow or whatever.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.107
She knows about the Iron Fist?

11:36.610 --> 11:39.602
I, uh... I can't.

11:40.990 --> 11:41.979
Not right now.

11:43.450 --> 11:45.987
Okay, uh... hand.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.240
Hold tightly here.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.660
You might not like this.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.667
- Oh, God.
- What is that?

11:59.090 --> 12:00.296
Are you sure about this?

12:00.630 --> 12:03.007
I'm sure you're gonna bleed to death
if I don't do this.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.756
Shit!

12:06.140 --> 12:07.960
Just a few more.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.887
I'll just do them one at a time, okay?

12:11.060 --> 12:12.687
Oh, it really hurts.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.186
Well, why don't you do something
to take your mind off of it?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.601
Like explain to me where the hell
you and Colleen went

12:17.770 --> 12:21.024
after I saw you get taken away
at the dojo by some mystery man.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.061
And why you just showed up at my door,
bleeding,

12:23.240 --> 12:25.731
- with a completely different mystery man.
- Davos.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.538
- You mentioned that.
- He's from K'un-Lun.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.788
The monastery? Seriously?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.417
Hey, can we go over this a little later,
please?

12:35.330 --> 12:39.084
Come on! That was two!

12:39.250 --> 12:40.501
Mm.

12:40.670 --> 12:42.251
You seem to be a very gifted healer.

12:43.590 --> 12:44.579
Thanks.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.637
It was Bakuto.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.306
The guy who saved us in the dojo.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.096
He's the one who stabbed me.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.347
What about Colleen? Is she okay?

12:55.020 --> 12:56.055
She's fine.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.856
Where is she?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.026
Hey, uh, Davos.

13:04.570 --> 13:07.118
Can you check the perimeter?
In case we're being followed.

13:07.530 --> 13:09.361
Uh, I've... I've already checked. Twice.

13:09.870 --> 13:12.111
- Just do it again.
- I'm... I'm not going to leave you.

13:12.790 --> 13:13.825
It's okay.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.452
We need to make sure we're safe.
The Hand have been here before.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.918
God damn!

13:36.900 --> 13:38.015
Colleen is in the Hand?

13:43.070 --> 13:45.356
- No way. Not possible.
- It's true.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.650
She's been a part of them
from the beginning.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.446
She helped us to fight Gao.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.367
Bakuto and Gao seem to hate each other.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.748
Maybe Colleen was helping Bakuto get rid
of Gao for whatever he's planning.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.029
How do you mean?

14:01.250 --> 14:05.163
He's building an army of Hand soldiers
here, in New York, Claire.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.467
This doesn't make sense.
Colleen IS a teacher.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.136
She helps kids get off the streets.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.801
Yeah, by sending them
straight to the Hand.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.431
And she was trying to do the same thing
to me.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.512
There's got to be
more going on here.

14:21.770 --> 14:24.477
You said it was like a cult compound?

14:25.110 --> 14:27.817
I mean, maybe she's been brainwashed.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.652
She lied.

14:31.780 --> 14:34.328
She's been lying to me from the beginning.
Everything she said.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.189
- Just... just using me!
- Danny...

14:37.290 --> 14:41.454
Danny. Calm the eff down.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.597
What just happened? You went nuclear.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.422
It's nothing, okay? I'm fine.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.090
- You're wrong about Colleen.
- I'm not.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.818
I'm gonna defeat the Hand, Claire.
Whatever it takes.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.146
It's what the Order of the Crane Mother
has trained me for.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.279
And did those monks teach you
how to deal with a broken heart?

15:12.570 --> 15:14.481
The way you two feel about each other?

15:15.740 --> 15:16.866
That's real.

15:20.670 --> 15:21.705
Are we done?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.796
I don't think
there's any internal bleeding.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.257
But that wound could easily get infected.
You need antibiotics.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.796
- You have any?
- No.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.092
Too many aggro would-be crime fighters
keep showing up hurt

15:37.430 --> 15:38.920
and cleaning out my supplies.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.429
Here.

15:46.690 --> 15:47.850
It's clean.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.019
Or cleaner.

15:51.990 --> 15:53.309
A friend of mine left it here.

15:56.700 --> 15:57.735
Is your friend okay?

15:58.790 --> 16:00.075
Probably doing better than you are.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.376
Anything else you need?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.297
I just need to restore my chi.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.338
Well, you're on your own with that.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.577
Hey, you look like you need a...

16:40.750 --> 16:42.456
A refill. Thanks.

16:42.620 --> 16:44.451
No, I was gonna say some sleep.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.701
You were up all night.

16:49.170 --> 16:52.719
After these past few weeks,
constantly feeling like I'm drowning.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.541
It's like...

16:54.930 --> 16:57.842
I know what I'm doing again.
I'm back in control.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.011
We're gonna get you free, Dad.

17:00.890 --> 17:03.552
The files you copied off that tablet
are exactly what we need to do it.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.800
No, that was just about the drug business.

17:05.980 --> 17:08.016
Oh, no.
There's a lot more to it than that.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.569
This is fraud on a scale that would make
the SEC have a heart attack.

17:14.070 --> 17:17.198
See, they've been hiding accounts
all over through Rand holdings.

17:17.450 --> 17:18.735
Massive amounts Of cash.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.498
And it was just sitting there...
until a few hours ago.

17:22.660 --> 17:23.649
Oh? What happened?

17:24.160 --> 17:26.663
Well, it started moving to a collection
of offshore holdings

17:26.830 --> 17:28.036
based in South America.

17:28.670 --> 17:31.298
That's Bakuto. Bakuto,
that's what he wants.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.792
He's stealing every cent
in Gao's piggy bank.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.336
No. These are Rand accounts.

17:37.930 --> 17:39.966
- It's our bank.
- This is it.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.927
This is the silver bullet
I've been looking for, Joy!

17:43.640 --> 17:44.880
-Joy.
-Mmm.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.726
I am so proud of you.

17:48.730 --> 17:49.970
Hey, you.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.988
The Hand has taken away
so many years from us.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.402
And we're gonna make 'em pay for it.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.369
Pay with everything they have.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.668
Hey, how about a juice?
Something fresh. Keep your energy up.

18:16.010 --> 18:17.966
Yeah, um...

18:19.010 --> 18:21.422
- I could use a stretch.
- Yeah.

18:24.850 --> 18:28.308
Hey, we heard anything from Danny?
We, uh, need him here.

18:28.810 --> 18:31.722
His phone is dead.
I am starting to worry about Ward.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.100
Oh, I wouldn't worry about your brother.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.099
He'll come back.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.270
He always does.

18:48.790 --> 18:49.779
Where's Danny?

18:50.210 --> 18:51.950
He went up to your roof
for his meditations.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.167
He needs to restore his chi
so he can summon the Iron Fist

18:55.340 --> 18:56.580
for our battle with the Hand.

18:57.630 --> 18:58.710
He told me to watch over you.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.040
Yeah, I bet he did.

19:05.890 --> 19:09.382
Well, as long as you're watching,
are you hungry?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.344
I ordered pizza.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.609
What passes for food in this world
is poison for both the body and soul.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.309
Okay.

19:20.360 --> 19:24.524
I guess you guys don't order
a lot of delivery in K'un-Lun.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.492
How much has Danny told you of K'un-Lun?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.239
Not much.

19:29.410 --> 19:32.743
Just, uh, that it's a remote monastery
up in the Himalayas,

19:33.330 --> 19:34.706
full of karate hunks.

19:35.590 --> 19:36.909
Kung Fu, not karate.

19:45.890 --> 19:47.096
These books.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.260
Why are you studying Reiki?

19:50.600 --> 19:53.307
I'm trying to understand how it is
that Danny does what he does.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.851
Healing through chi.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.600
Reiki is thought of as a pseudoscience,

19:59.940 --> 20:04.479
but there are stories of it healing
tumours and curing disease.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.236
So, maybe it's more real than I thought.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.248
You know, chi is the breath of life.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.666
It's what powers the Iron Fist.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.832
Where does that come from? The Fist?

20:20.630 --> 20:22.621
It's a force that lives
in the heart of Shou-Lao

20:22.800 --> 20:24.506
until a warrior from the monastery
can claim it.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.763
What, or, uh, who is Shou-Lao?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.509
A dragon.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.688
Okay. Wow.

20:36.270 --> 20:37.567
Dragons aren't real.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.565
Why would you think that?

20:43.700 --> 20:47.192
Okay, you mean, like...
...a small thing,

20:47.330 --> 20:48.319
like a Komodo dragon?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.785
Of Me
Pete ’5 Dragon?

20:58.290 --> 20:59.450
But think infinite.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.045
So, do you have to kill it?

21:06.800 --> 21:08.597
Shou-Lao is undying.

21:12.390 --> 21:13.379
Do you have it?

21:14.600 --> 21:15.726
The Iron Fist?

21:25.490 --> 21:26.479
No.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.689
There's only one.

21:29.990 --> 21:31.651
I trained for it, same as Danny.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.111
But ultimately,
Lei Kung and the elder monks

21:34.290 --> 21:37.123
decided it was Danny
who should enter the cave.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.449
Hmm.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.713
He was the first... outsider to be chosen.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.710
Why him?

21:50.470 --> 21:51.596
I don't know.

21:53.470 --> 21:56.303
But I think Lei Kung made
the wrong choice.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.148
Danny's... trying to do good.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.140
Make the world a better place.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.948
No, no, no, no.
This... This is not his world.

22:09.910 --> 22:11.229
Well, I think it is.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.030
I think it always has been.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.490
He abandoned K'un-Lun.

22:18.750 --> 22:22.208
The people who took him in. Cared for him.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.699
I treated him like a brother...

22:25.550 --> 22:27.086
and he stole the Fist from K'un-Lun.

22:27.260 --> 22:29.216
He stole from us! The Fist was...

22:43.480 --> 22:45.311
I apologise.
I shouldn't have raised my voice.

22:47.990 --> 22:51.312
- What did you do just there?
- I centred myself.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.655
Calmed the storm inside me.

22:56.330 --> 22:59.413
- I've seen Danny do that.
- It's how we were trained.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.661
You don't let emotions cloud your actions.

23:03.460 --> 23:08.875
So you just lock it all away?
Pretend your emotions aren't there?

23:10.430 --> 23:12.091
A weapon doesn't know feelings.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.101
You know, Danny should be back by now.

23:23.020 --> 23:25.102
Perhaps his chi is more damaged
than we thought.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.817
But Master Lei Kung will be able to fix it
once Danny returns to K'un-Lun.

23:30.990 --> 23:32.651
Wait, you think he's going back?

23:33.740 --> 23:35.901
I'll make him. IfI have to.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.241
Uh, it's...
...just the pizza.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.000
You know what?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.830
I'll be right back.

23:53.550 --> 23:54.630
I should go with you.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.979
Uh... You know, it's hard enough
being a delivery guy

23:59.140 --> 24:02.644
without a warrior monk accidentally
kicking the crap out of you.

24:04.480 --> 24:07.643
So, just... wait here.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.875
Already paid for it.

24:37.850 --> 24:40.171
- Danny told you.
- So, it's true?

24:41.770 --> 24:43.089
You're in the Hand.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.515
I need to talk to him.

24:47.610 --> 24:49.396
Yeah, I don't know that he wants
to talk to you.

24:50.860 --> 24:53.272
- I don't know that I do, either.
- Claire, please.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.657
They killed friends of mine
and you knew that.

24:56.530 --> 24:59.943
And that is why I couldn't tell you.
Either of you.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.617
You let me think that I was actually
doing something to stop them.

25:02.790 --> 25:03.825
We were.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.570
There are different groups within
the Hand, okay?

25:05.750 --> 25:07.786
I'm part of one that is trying
to help people.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.627
Then did you think about trying
a different name for the group?

25:11.380 --> 25:14.429
Like the Ear? Or the Arm?

25:16.390 --> 25:17.630
I didn't want to hurt you.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.385
You lied, Colleen.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.089
To the both of us.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.267
What did you think was gonna happen?

25:31.110 --> 25:32.270
Right.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.231
This was a mistake.

25:37.990 --> 25:39.025
Wait.

25:42.410 --> 25:45.368
Look, I don't wanna attack you
just because my feelings are hurt.

25:46.330 --> 25:48.878
I just spent the last hour defending you
to Danny.

25:57.930 --> 26:00.672
I told him that I thought you were
a good person, no matter what.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.129
So, ifI let you in...

26:08.520 --> 26:10.010
what are you gonna tell him?

27:30.600 --> 27:31.589
See anything?

27:32.650 --> 27:34.891
Rocks. Clouds.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.139
Same as yesterday.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.065
Guarding the pass.

27:43.780 --> 27:46.283
You know what the whole
rest of your life is gonna be.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.298
- Guarding the pass.
- Guarding K'un-Lun.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.680
Danny?

28:15.110 --> 28:17.146
I didn't know where else
you would go.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.429
Is Bakuto with you?

28:21.900 --> 28:22.901
No.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.149
Are you okay?

28:29.870 --> 28:31.781
I'm fine. Claire stitched me up.

28:32.790 --> 28:33.859
You don't look fine.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.241
She's just running a little low
on antibiotics.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.581
You need to go to the hospital, Danny.

28:39.130 --> 28:41.337
Yeah. That's because your sensei
stabbed me.

28:43.590 --> 28:47.253
- He says you attacked him first.
- That's not what happened.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.591
Okay, then what did happen?

28:50.770 --> 28:52.340
He's not a good guy, Colleen.

28:52.730 --> 28:54.846
He's building an army in there.
How can you not see that?

28:55.020 --> 28:57.011
- He is empowering those kids.
- To do what?

28:57.770 --> 29:00.898
To become the kind of people who help
make the world a better place.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.489
He's getting them jobs in hospitals...
...and businesses.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.867
He's using them for his own means.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.656
It's the same thing he's doing to you.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.406
Are you gonna believe everything
they taught you in K'un-Lun?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.616
The world is more complicated than
what a bunch of monks think.

29:14.790 --> 29:17.418
- The Hand is evil.
- You're wrong!

29:18.210 --> 29:19.950
Why are you even here, Colleen?

29:21.090 --> 29:22.159
Because...

29:25.340 --> 29:26.887
Because I care about you.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.011
And the way things are going...

29:33.310 --> 29:35.187
I wanted to say I tried...

29:36.810 --> 29:38.186
to make things right between us.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.180
Did Bakuto tell you to say that, too?

29:42.440 --> 29:45.398
Just stop.
I'm telling you the truth.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.941
How can I ever trust you again?

30:06.680 --> 30:07.965
I am the Iron Fist.

30:08.930 --> 30:10.420
Protector of K'un-Lun.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.596
Sworn enemy of the Hand.

30:17.940 --> 30:19.555
And I am Colleen Wing.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.970
And I took an oath to serve the Hand.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.690
Look, I know you won't believe me...

30:32.700 --> 30:34.076
but I am sorry...

30:36.710 --> 30:37.859
for everything.

30:58.730 --> 31:00.015
It's not... It's not horrible.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.226
That's your reaction to Joe's?

31:03.570 --> 31:06.778
The best slice in New York.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.906
It's... It's chevw.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.586
We have to go.

31:22.790 --> 31:24.417
Where?

31:25.250 --> 31:27.002
Do you still have the tablet
I took to China?

31:27.460 --> 31:28.461
Yeah.

31:28.630 --> 31:30.427
I need to get it to my father's
old business partner.

31:31.340 --> 31:32.420
He can help us out.

31:33.430 --> 31:36.718
Okay, Danny, think this through.

31:38.140 --> 31:40.438
You can't just keep charging into this.

31:40.850 --> 31:42.260
The Hand wants something from you.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.147
Rushing in blindly could be it.

31:46.110 --> 31:50.479
I only want one thing...
and that's to see the Hand destroyed.

31:52.950 --> 31:55.487
And then you go back to K'un-Lun?

32:01.670 --> 32:03.240
Davos, could you give us a minute?

32:06.420 --> 32:08.957
I'll be outside... keeping guard.

32:16.510 --> 32:18.558
Danny,
I don't like what's happening to you.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.305
Look, I'm fine.

32:24.270 --> 32:25.851
I finally know what my purpose is.

32:26.650 --> 32:29.642
- To destroy...
- Destroy the Hand. Yeah, I get it.

32:30.990 --> 32:34.369
But you can do a lot more
than destroy, Danny.

32:35.490 --> 32:38.288
Look, I don't know why you left
K'un-Lun...

32:39.540 --> 32:41.451
but whatever_ it is
that you're lookIng for,

32:41.620 --> 32:43.781
you're not going to find it back there.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.628
You had a traumatic experience as a kid.

32:47.800 --> 32:52.419
And I think that all that rage and anger
that you've been burying

32:52.590 --> 32:55.718
since you were ten years old
is still there.

32:56.430 --> 32:57.886
And if you are not careful...

32:59.180 --> 33:01.387
if you do not figure out
a way to deal with it...

33:02.430 --> 33:05.979
then destroying is going to be
all that you are good for.

33:10.730 --> 33:11.810
Thank you, Claire...

33:13.150 --> 33:14.310
for everything.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.400
Look, I... I just need one last thing.

33:22.790 --> 33:23.825
Name it.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.086
Can I borrow your car?

33:35.720 --> 33:36.755
Yeah.

33:37.590 --> 33:38.591
Thanks.

33:51.980 --> 33:55.689
- Becca?
- Sensel Wing.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.487
- Heard you were working here.
- I know, can you believe it?

33:59.950 --> 34:02.327
When you met me,
I was pick-pocketing on the L Train.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.287
Now I'm going to be a doctor.

34:05.750 --> 34:08.457
Can we talk somewhere private?

34:08.710 --> 34:09.699
Yeah.

34:15.090 --> 34:18.002
I need antibiotics for a wound
that might have gotten infected.

34:18.510 --> 34:19.499
It's not for me.

34:20.430 --> 34:22.557
You know, the infirmary at the compound
should be stocked if that's...

34:22.720 --> 34:26.429
Yeah, I can't really go to the compound.
Not now. That's why I came to you.

34:27.390 --> 34:28.641
I could get in trouble.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.771
Am I your sensei or not?

34:34.990 --> 34:35.979
No, of course.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.812
Whatever you need.
The Hand always comes first.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.951
Mmm... It's good to have you back, Danny.

35:00.550 --> 35:01.960
He told me everything.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.216
We were just trying to protect you.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.306
By lying to me?

35:07.520 --> 35:10.057
Oh, Joy. He was just respecting my wishes.

35:10.230 --> 35:11.606
He was trying to keep you safe.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.642
- Well, look what that got us.
- Oh, that was in the past.

35:15.150 --> 35:17.687
Now we're ready to take
the fight to the Hand.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.355
As a family.

35:20.860 --> 35:22.566
Hey, who's your friend lurking
in the elevator?

35:23.660 --> 35:24.786
This is Davos.

35:29.670 --> 35:33.333
- He's from K'un-Lun.
- Oh, does he have the Iron Fist, too?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.871
No. I do not.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.132
But he's as skilled a warrior as I am...

35:41.680 --> 35:43.136
and he's ready to fight, as well.

35:43.680 --> 35:44.669
Please.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.097
Bakuto's compound's a fortress.

35:48.270 --> 35:50.306
He has too many men for us to go in alone.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.930
We'd be swarmed
before we got to him.

35:52.100 --> 35:53.681
Well, you're not going in.

35:54.270 --> 35:55.760
We're gonna draw him out.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.519
How?

35:59.110 --> 36:01.601
I copied the data from the tablet
before you left.

36:01.820 --> 36:03.367
Joy's been going through it.

36:04.030 --> 36:06.442
Bakuto has been transferring the money

36:06.620 --> 36:09.953
that Gao was hiding in Rand
to his own account.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.536
And now that we've been reinstated
In the company,

36:13.080 --> 36:15.958
I have access to the same accounts
Bakuto's been draining.

36:16.460 --> 36:18.792
- And I can close them.
- And when that happens...

36:19.590 --> 36:21.922
- you think Bakuto will come here?
- Well, hell, I would.

36:22.340 --> 36:26.049
You know, they may claim
to have loftier ideals,

36:26.220 --> 36:29.462
but the Hand are just common criminals
with good marketing skills.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.346
You take their money
and they'll come running.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.261
You two stake out the compound.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.313
Once we close off the accounts,
he'll come out into the open.

36:41.570 --> 36:45.313
Even if we take Bakuto off-guard,
and he's away from his soldiers,

36:45.490 --> 36:46.650
he's still a skilled fighter.

36:46.990 --> 36:50.403
Yeah, but he'll be no match
for the two of K'un-Lun's finest warriors.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.571
Especially when one of them
has the Iron Fist.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.088
I just want to make sure
we're all on the same page here.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.549
We are talking about having Bakuto
arrested, right?

37:02.130 --> 37:06.248
No. No more traps. No more interrogations.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.057
This has to be done the way it should
have been from the start.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.011
You're talking about murder.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.512
We cut off the head
and the snake will die.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.241
Hey. Did you get it?

37:34.410 --> 37:35.991
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.912
I did my job.
That's how the Hand functions.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.546
Everyone does their job.

37:46.050 --> 37:48.541
Your job was to tell Bakuto
if you found Danny.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.635
Brian, Mary.

37:54.180 --> 37:56.182
You guys been keeping up
with your training?

37:56.600 --> 37:59.057
- You need to come with us.
- Bakuto wants to talk to you.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.067
Tell him to meet me at my dojo.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.731
That's not gonna happen.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.156
Sensei. Please.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.667
Guess we better not keep him waiting.

38:26.050 --> 38:28.792
No one inside you don't know, understood?

38:31.510 --> 38:34.513
- You vouch for him?
- That's Gary.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.556
He helped us with the Miami thing.

38:39.860 --> 38:45.184
Oh, well... let's hope tonight's
a little less messy than that.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.941
How long has Singleton known?

38:52.240 --> 38:54.993
Well, I had to keep a few cards
close to my chest.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.997
No, they're just here as a precaution.

38:57.750 --> 38:58.910
And the other guy?

38:59.080 --> 39:03.198
I mean, is it really a good idea for
anyone else to know you're alive?

39:03.460 --> 39:05.200
Well, if things go well tonight,

39:05.380 --> 39:09.419
I don't think my, uh... my demise
will be an issue much longer.

39:10.090 --> 39:13.423
Is that your plan?
Just come back from the dead?

39:13.600 --> 39:16.262
If Danny can do it,
why can't I?

39:17.640 --> 39:20.302
Even if we have to murder people to do it?

39:21.310 --> 39:22.800
Whatever it takes, Joy.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.430
Whatever it takes.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.106
So...

39:29.360 --> 39:31.658
are we ready to turn off
the Hand's accounts?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.731
Dad, I just got you back.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.445
I mean, if we do this...

39:37.410 --> 39:39.116
The Hand's not gonna take it lightly.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.417
This could make everything worse.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.569
Hey...

39:43.540 --> 39:47.294
I've wasted too much time imprisoned
by these monsters.

39:47.460 --> 39:49.291
I don't want to lose another day.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.138
- But what you're asking Danny to do...
- Enough!

39:53.430 --> 39:55.967
I thought you were stronger than this, eh?

39:56.140 --> 39:58.677
Did I back the right child
in this war or not?

40:02.690 --> 40:04.646
It's Danny. He's at the compound.

40:06.650 --> 40:08.686
Come on. Shut down the accounts.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.349
Now.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.325
Atta girl.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.671
Seriously?

40:43.440 --> 40:44.759
Where's Bakuto?

40:48.400 --> 40:49.719
Are we still in the compound?

40:51.450 --> 40:52.690
Is this detention?

40:53.820 --> 40:54.809
Huh?

40:55.820 --> 40:57.151
Why won't you answer me?

40:57.490 --> 40:59.651
Because I've ordered them not to.

41:00.660 --> 41:03.993
And you taught your students
how to respect the chain of command.

41:04.710 --> 41:06.371
Something you seem to have forgotten.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.121
Bakuto, what the hell is this?

41:09.500 --> 41:12.719
You were supposed to tell me
when you found Danny.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.886
I blame myself for this.

41:23.810 --> 41:25.721
Bakuto, I believe in the Hand!

41:27.230 --> 41:30.643
But I don't know... ifI believe in you.

41:32.650 --> 41:33.890
Not anymore.

41:34.910 --> 41:38.983
You've let Danny infect you
with doubt about our cause.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.900
And there's no cure for that.

41:43.790 --> 41:45.109
What are you gonna do?

41:51.590 --> 41:53.501
Bakuto?

42:02.350 --> 42:05.137
After all that we've been through,

42:05.940 --> 42:09.353
at least we can take some comfort...

42:10.110 --> 42:12.476
knowing that in your final moments...

42:14.440 --> 42:16.317
you'll still be giving to the Hand.

42:20.030 --> 42:21.691
Wait, wait.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.780
What do you mean, "giving to the Hand"?

42:25.040 --> 42:26.610
Bakuto!

43:00.820 --> 43:02.731
After everything you have taught us...

43:03.660 --> 43:05.616
how could you betray the Hand?

43:08.250 --> 43:09.410
Nothing?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.707
You're not gonna give me one of your
little sanctimonious speeches

43:13.880 --> 43:16.667
about the code, teamwork and all that?

43:20.470 --> 43:22.381
What was it you used to say, sensei?

43:23.890 --> 43:26.552
A single arrow is easily broken.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.261
Because right now,
you look pretty broken to me.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.561
Shit!

43:39.110 --> 43:40.737
She broke my damn nose.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.165
I still don't understand.

44:38.420 --> 44:40.968
I didn't let you drive
because it's not my car.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.922
And besides,
you don't even have a license.

44:44.590 --> 44:45.750
Do you have a license?

44:46.180 --> 44:48.341
No, but it's different. I'm rich.

44:49.270 --> 44:50.555
Well, last time I drove with you,

44:50.730 --> 44:53.051
you wrecked Brother Kuo's cart,
do you remember?

44:53.480 --> 44:56.608
You wanted to take the unpaved road around
the lake because...

44:56.770 --> 44:58.726
...you thought you'd see
the girls from the village bathing.

44:58.900 --> 45:00.436
Yeah.

45:01.110 --> 45:04.352
And all we saw was your dad
doing his private meditations.

45:05.200 --> 45:09.284
- In the nude.
- Yeah, I know, okay? I remember.

45:17.170 --> 45:19.798
Do you ever think
that maybe the Thunderer was wrong?

45:21.170 --> 45:22.467
About certain things?

45:24.930 --> 45:27.137
Everyone meditates
in their own private way.

45:27.300 --> 45:28.460
That's not what I meant.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.510
Sometimes I get these...

45:34.350 --> 45:35.510
these flashes.

45:37.110 --> 45:38.099
Anger.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.779
It's like a...
a fire burning inside of me.

45:44.990 --> 45:47.811
Every time it happens, it...

45:48.280 --> 45:50.111
it gets harder and harder to control.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.320
Did you ever think that maybe
this turmoil you're in

45:55.500 --> 45:57.411
is because you questioned
Lei Kung's teachings?

45:58.170 --> 46:00.206
If you'd just followed the path
he laid out for you,

46:00.380 --> 46:02.587
none of this would be happening.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.676
Sometimes my anger gets
the better of me as well.

46:15.850 --> 46:16.930
Why?

46:24.280 --> 46:26.271
I thought the Iron Fist
was my birth right.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.650
You wanted to be chosen?

46:30.910 --> 46:32.036
It's all I ever wanted.

46:34.450 --> 46:36.452
To be the protector. To guard the pass.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.586
And you took it from me.

46:42.460 --> 46:43.757
I accepted that.

46:45.170 --> 46:46.467
You were still my brother.

46:47.590 --> 46:50.673
But then you ran,
like a thief in the night.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.590
- That's not what happened.
- Then explain it to me.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.840
I want to know why you abandoned us.

46:59.150 --> 47:00.686
Why you abandoned me.

47:03.980 --> 47:05.607
Ever since I got to K'un-Lun...

47:07.070 --> 47:08.901
ever since the crash, I...

47:10.620 --> 47:12.269
I've always felt empty.

47:17.660 --> 47:21.164
I thought maybe the...
the Iron Fist would fix me.

47:25.170 --> 47:26.410
But it didn't.

47:28.340 --> 47:31.844
At first
I thought maybe it was a mistake.

47:34.890 --> 47:36.972
That .7 wasn ’t supposed
to he the Iron Fist

47:39.850 --> 47:41.431
I was looking for a sign.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.602
Then I saw this hawk.

47:46.690 --> 47:49.523
And I watched it fly further and further
down the mountain,

47:49.950 --> 47:51.486
and that’s when I knew.

47:51.740 --> 47:55.653
The way to K’un-Lun was open.
I could /ea ve.

47:58.620 --> 48:00.030
I was looking for a sign...

48:02.000 --> 48:04.878
and instead, it showed me a path.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.830
Maybe it is a sign.

48:10.090 --> 48:12.752
A sign telling you, Danny,
that the path is open.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.466
That K'un-Lun needs protection.

48:18.770 --> 48:19.976
It's where you belong.

48:21.270 --> 48:23.340
And look what a mess you've made here.

48:25.190 --> 48:27.522
I've seen this world. I'm...

48:28.280 --> 48:30.100
I'm not sure it's worth fighting for.

48:32.820 --> 48:33.980
Come home.

48:39.540 --> 48:41.110
Danny, what is keeping you here?

48:49.590 --> 48:51.410
Wait, we have to wait for Bakuto.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.525
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.076
Hey! Whoa! Colleen, wait!

49:19.240 --> 49:20.992
Hey, hey!

49:21.160 --> 49:23.367
- I'm not here to hurt you.
- Why not?

49:24.120 --> 49:27.499
You're the destroyer of the Hand!
I'm the Hand!

49:27.920 --> 49:31.833
So light up your damn fist
and destroy me!

49:34.930 --> 49:36.295
Colleen, please.

49:39.930 --> 49:43.422
It's not what I thought it was.

49:45.730 --> 49:47.140
Look, I know what it's like

49:47.860 --> 49:49.976
to spend your whole life believing
in something

49:50.150 --> 49:51.219
and have it pulled away.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.817
But we have to stop fighting.

49:55.070 --> 49:56.810
We have to stop running.

50:13.210 --> 50:14.962
We have to stop destroying everything.
