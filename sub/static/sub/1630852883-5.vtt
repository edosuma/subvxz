Toman:
Today, two sides of the creek,

00:28.403 --> 00:31.281
once embroiled in a bitter
capture the flag war,

00:31.281 --> 00:34.242
come together to put aside
their differences...

00:34.242 --> 00:35.410
and to eat!

00:35.410 --> 00:36.619
Let's see what we've got here.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.414
That looks good.
Oh, I like that too.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.916
Hey, hey, peanut head.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.710
Peanut head.
Of course.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.755
What's up, Toman?

00:43.793 --> 00:46.755
What are you doing?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.381
I'm filming
a documentary.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.049
I thought it would be good
to introduce the kids

00:50.133 --> 00:52.635
on the other side of the creek
to the legend of Toman.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.137
AKA Tomato Man.

00:54.137 --> 00:57.223
AKA...
a third thing.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.975
Ooh, can I be in it?

00:58.975 --> 01:00.935
No.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.935
Great.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.687
Did you get that?

01:05.273 --> 01:07.192
Blur!

01:07.192 --> 01:09.110
Didn't have time
to make my dish.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.654
There we go.
Kimbap.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.907
Whew. Couldn't live it down
if I was late, huh?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.533
Being the Blur and all.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.289
Relax, Craiggy.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.583
The capture the flag war
is over.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.381
This food is so good.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.841
Craig: Ding, ding, ding.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.426
Ding, ding, ding.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.596
Uh, I-I'd like to make a toast,
if I could.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.848
You know, seeing everyone
at this table,

01:38.932 --> 01:42.393
it's hard to imagine there was
ever two sides to this creek.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.021
So now, with no king
to divide us

01:45.021 --> 01:46.439
or tell us how to play,

01:46.523 --> 01:48.858
I'm just looking forward
to a new afternoon

01:48.942 --> 01:51.361
where all of us
can be creek kids

01:51.361 --> 01:52.862
together.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.697
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:54.781 --> 01:56.991
I'll raise a juice box
to that, yeah.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.076
What's up, everybody?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.702
You all know me
as the Blur,

01:59.786 --> 02:02.330
but my friends over here
call me Keun Sup.

02:02.330 --> 02:05.583
Crowd: Keun Sup,
Keun Sup, Keun Sup!

02:05.667 --> 02:06.876
I had a lot of time
to think

02:06.960 --> 02:09.546
while I was trapped
in cannon space.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.465
What does it all mean?!

02:12.549 --> 02:15.885
But it made me realize that the
creek is all about having fun.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.346
So, let's relax and
have some fun today.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.014
Who's with me?

02:20.098 --> 02:22.892
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

02:28.398 --> 02:30.775
Ooh, finesse.

02:38.241 --> 02:41.619
Whoa, you got finessed!
Did you get that?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.663
Zoom in, zoom in, zoom in.
Lookit that. Did you see that?

02:43.663 --> 02:46.624
He got finessed
from a full clench.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.086
Ah, I'm just kidding, man.
Put 'er there.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.632
I mean, what are we
going to tell him?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.217
We can't just
get rid of him.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.053
It was a full clench.
How do you come back from that?

02:59.137 --> 03:00.013
Hey, guys.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.347
Aaah! Craig!

03:01.431 --> 03:02.849
Whoa, hey.
What's going on?

03:02.849 --> 03:06.686
Choco-Rolls are poisoned today,
so w-we gotta go.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.854
Guys, what?

03:07.854 --> 03:10.023
Hey, Finesse.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.234
Finesse. Finesse. Finesse.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.320
Oh no.
I've got a...

03:15.320 --> 03:18.615
bad nickname!

03:18.615 --> 03:19.908
Sorry, Craig.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.994
I guess...
it caught on after yesterday.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.874
But don't worry.

03:27.874 --> 03:31.044
It's not like everyone's
talking about it.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.296
Huh?

03:33.296 --> 03:34.631
Bryson?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.467
<i>Cuzzo, yo.
I heard you got finessed.</i>

03:37.467 --> 03:39.969
What?
It's spread that far already?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.346
<i>It's the digital age, man.</i>

03:41.346 --> 03:43.556
<i>Even my dad heard about it.</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:46.476
<i>He says he can't be your uncle
in public no more.</i>

03:51.898 --> 03:54.359
Hmm.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.071
Hmph.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.240
King me.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.242
Wha--
You cheated.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.494
Did not, liar!

04:04.494 --> 04:05.787
Did too, jerk!

04:05.787 --> 04:06.913
Dungus!

04:10.500 --> 04:11.668
Uh, Keun Sup?

04:11.668 --> 04:12.794
Huh?

04:12.794 --> 04:14.337
Can I talk to you
about something?

04:14.337 --> 04:16.297
Sure, man,
what's on your mind?

04:16.381 --> 04:18.591
Aah! How do you --
Ahh, listen.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.176
I still can't shake
what happened

04:20.176 --> 04:21.511
at the festival
the other day.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.846
Are you seriously
still hung up about that?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.349
Everyone keeps
calling me Finesse.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.393
And not
in a cool way.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.061
Ugh, I'm sorry, okay?

04:30.061 --> 04:31.270
It was just a joke.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.689
Don't take it personally.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.274
I tease everybody I like.
That's just my style.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
This guy knows
what I'm talkin' about.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.113
Yeah, huh,
classic Keun Sup.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.198
Yeah, well, maybe to you
it was just a joke.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.575
But you embarrassed me
in front of everyone.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.286
I'd never do that
to a friend.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.496
Oh.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.706
I'm sorry, Craig.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.040
I didn't mean
for it to blow up like this.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.085
I know how much a bad
nickname can drain on you.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.712
I'm the slowest
in my family,

04:55.712 --> 04:58.506
so they always called me
"slowpoke."

04:58.506 --> 05:00.842
You're the slowest?

04:58.589 --> 05:00.842
Yeah.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.554
But none of that mattered
once I got a cool nickname.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.347
A cool nickname?

05:04.637 --> 05:06.347
Yeah.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.057
I was the Blur,
remember?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.226
Doesn't get much "blurter"
than that.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.646
You know,
"blurter" like better?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.148
Sorry,
it's a force of habit.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.401
Point is, we just gotta
find you a cool new nickname.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.570
And I'm gonna help.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.449
Hm.
So, what am I working with?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.826
What are Craig's
best qualities?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.579
He's the bravest explorer
I've ever known.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.789
Well, for me, it's that
he's always just got

05:31.873 --> 05:33.082
a shoulder to lean on.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.127
Yeah. And I always
save the ♪ day ♪

05:36.127 --> 05:37.837
It's Craig of the creek.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.131
I'm sure you
Do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.759
Listen, if you really want
a cool nickname,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.219
you gotta do
something amazing.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.554
When I first
came to the creek,

05:46.554 --> 05:48.723
I wanted to make
a big impression.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.184
So I brought my
favorite frisdisk

05:51.184 --> 05:53.269
and I threw it
as hard as I could.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.104
And as the kids
watched it fly,

05:55.188 --> 05:58.649
who did they see
waiting to catch it but me.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.444
And that's how I became
the Blur.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.781
So like I said...

06:04.781 --> 06:06.115
you just gotta
do something

06:06.199 --> 06:07.992
that really grabs
people's attention.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.703
I have a few ideas that
just might do the trick.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.164
By the end of the day,
you'll have the coolest

06:13.164 --> 06:16.793
nickname that everyone's
gonna "remem-blur."

06:16.793 --> 06:17.960
I can't just turn it off,
okay?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.754
Leave me alone.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.383
So what you gotta do is just
chug a bunch of seltzer

06:24.467 --> 06:25.802
and burp out your name.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.931
Trust me, Craiggy baby,
everybody loves burping.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.146
Hm?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.565
Hey there.
My name is...

06:41.818 --> 06:44.403
Ugh!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.656
Ugh.
You wanna hang out with me?

06:46.656 --> 06:47.657
Ew, no.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.368
Get away from me, Barfy.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.580
Barfy.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.500
Let's get you outta here,
bud.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.127
Okay, new approach.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.713
Showing up with a cool accessory
always helps you stand out.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.174
And nothing says "I'm desperate
for attention"

07:05.258 --> 07:07.260
like wearing a snake.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.849
Wow.
Look at snake kid.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.850
Ooh.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.893
He's sssso cool.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
Ah, the word on the street
is that kid's about

07:18.521 --> 07:22.358
to snake his way to the top
of the cool charts.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.985
You're not gonna wanna
miss this.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.612
Boy: Oh, his centrifugal force.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.868
Uh...

07:31.868 --> 07:36.622
Wow.
Nice mis-snake, Craig.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.208
Please tell me
you got that on camera.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.127
It's hard to tell
since it's cardboard.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.296
I don't know if
you're getting anything.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.047
Hmm.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.924
Dashawn: Tumbles!

07:48.050 --> 07:50.678
Sam: Big Tuna!

07:51.762 --> 07:53.764
Jeremy: Carrot Cakes!

07:55.474 --> 07:58.603
Why'd you wear that
giant carrot costume, again?

07:58.603 --> 08:01.314
I was just trying to
get rid of one dumb name,

08:01.314 --> 08:03.191
now I have five more.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.526
Hey, cheer up, dude.
The name will pass eventually.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.070
I mean, they can't remember
all of them.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.447
You could just cycle
through them, like,

08:09.447 --> 08:10.740
depending on your mood?

08:10.740 --> 08:12.533
It'd be like trying on
different pairs of shoes,

08:12.617 --> 08:15.745
except the shoes
all make you want to cry.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.496
This is a bad idea.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.956
I don't want
any nicknames.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.875
This is all your fault,
Keun Sup.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.835
You ruined my life forever.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.296
Hey, man, I did everything
I could do to help.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.923
It's outta my hands now.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.425
Maybe you just gotta accept
that you'll always be a goofball

08:29.425 --> 08:32.803
and that people will always
laugh at you, not with you.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.931
Toman: Okay,
everybody, line up.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.515
Single file line, y'all.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.559
One at a time,
one at a time.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.770
I'll make them
laugh with me.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.606
Thank you, everybody, for coming
to my fan meet and greet.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.274
As you're all aware, we just
finished wrapping up

08:45.358 --> 08:49.278
filming for my new documentary
"From Boy Toman."

08:49.362 --> 08:52.198
Yeah! Alright!

08:52.198 --> 08:53.783
Ayyyy.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.119
Huh? Oh, man, you're gonna want
to get this on tape.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.121
Well, look who it is.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.166
If it ain't
Mr. Finesse himself.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.293
AKA Barf Barf Barferson.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.337
AKA Carrot Cake.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.048
AKA Tumblina.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.592
Don't forget Finesse.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.014
Huh?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.933
- Huh?
- Huh?

09:18.933 --> 09:20.518
What's he doing
over there?

09:20.518 --> 09:23.396
Oh, man, you really got me,
Toman.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.940
You know, those names used to
get on my nerves,

09:25.940 --> 09:28.150
but now they've
really grown on me.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.528
So, hey,
can I get a handshake?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.572
From the best kid athlete
in the world.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.575
Sure.
Anything for a fan, Finesse.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.953
Finesse.
Finesse. Finesse.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
Keun Sup:
<i>I know what he's up to.</i>

09:40.663 --> 09:42.665
<i>He's gonna try
to finesse Toman.</i>

09:42.665 --> 09:43.958
<i>He can't pull that off.</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:45.001
<i>But what if he does?</i>

09:45.001 --> 09:46.669
<i>Toman won't live that down.</i>

09:46.669 --> 09:48.337
<i>He'll just keep
finessing other kids.</i>

09:48.421 --> 09:49.922
<i>And then they'll do it too.</i>

09:50.006 --> 09:51.924
<i>The cycle will never end,</i>

09:52.008 --> 09:53.342
<i>and it'll be all my fault.</i>

09:53.426 --> 09:54.802
<i>I gotta stop him.</i>

09:54.802 --> 09:57.305
So then I put on
my other slipper,

09:57.305 --> 10:00.016
and there was dog food
in that one.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.392
- Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
- Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!

10:03.311 --> 10:07.732
Whoa!

10:07.732 --> 10:11.944
Finesse?

10:12.028 --> 10:14.447
Craig just finessed
that running kid.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.866
Finesse just
finessed him.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.410
Does that mean
he's the new Finesse?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.666
No.
His name is not "Finesse."

10:25.750 --> 10:27.960
It's Keun Sup.
And I'm Craig.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.171
And that is what we want
to be called.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.716
Yeah. Can everyone stop
calling me Toe-Jam Sam?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.884
It was one time!

10:34.884 --> 10:37.678
Yeah, and stop calling me
Zero Kid.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.096
This is supposed to be
a ring.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.931
Yeah,
and my name's Jeremy.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.558
I don't have a nickname,

10:42.558 --> 10:45.394
but can someone just
remember my name?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.229
Yeah.
Joking around is fun and all,

10:47.313 --> 10:50.316
but nicknames can hurt
when you don't want 'em.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.030
Craig and Keun Sup!
Craig and Keun Sup!

10:56.030 --> 10:58.741
And Toman!

10:58.741 --> 11:02.161
