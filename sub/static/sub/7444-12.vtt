00:16.781 --> 00:18.214
It's a jungle out there.

00:37.061 --> 00:38.733
It's a jungle out there.

00:53.021 --> 00:55.501
Giovanni, there's been some trouble.

00:55.536 --> 00:56.775
I just shot Andrew Veniamin.

00:58.381 --> 01:01.261
He's dead. Call the police.

01:03.261 --> 01:09.301
# To be a partyhead is something
I could never do

01:09.336 --> 01:14.586
# I don't like no-one except for you

01:14.621 --> 01:19.137
# You're my only friend,
you don't even like me

01:24.741 --> 01:29.417
# You're my only friend,
you don't even like me... #

02:20.501 --> 02:22.332
Guess we better get goin', eh?

02:34.501 --> 02:36.731
You dressed?

02:43.861 --> 02:45.581
Bobbie?

02:45.616 --> 02:47.266
Bobbie?

02:47.301 --> 02:49.132
Fuck off, toad.

03:03.061 --> 03:05.575
Temper, temper, Carl.

03:06.741 --> 03:08.821
Don't you have any respect,
Detective?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.346
I'm goin' to a fuckin' funeral.

03:10.381 --> 03:12.261
I just wanted
to reassure you personally

03:12.296 --> 03:14.598
that the Purana Taskforce
is here for you.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.866
Any time, day or night,
at your service.

03:16.901 --> 03:21.179
Look around the corner,
and, hey presto, there we'll be.

03:23.301 --> 03:24.780
Enjoy the wake.

03:26.421 --> 03:28.746
You're still a sphincter, Owen!

03:28.781 --> 03:31.898
You're a hairy, brown-ringed,
smelly old sphincter!

03:34.661 --> 03:36.731
Cage successfully rattled.

03:38.621 --> 03:41.746
I didn't know him for very long,

03:41.781 --> 03:45.057
but Benji was what I call
a true friend.

03:46.901 --> 03:51.021
Yep, he was a real...
What's the name?

03:51.056 --> 03:53.026
<i>... role model.</i>

03:53.061 --> 03:56.241
Yeah, yeah, he had, uh,

03:56.276 --> 03:59.421
fuckin' awesome tatts.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.066
Yeah.

04:02.101 --> 04:04.146
And like Benji would have said,

04:04.181 --> 04:06.861
we should all just get pissed
and go and get a root

04:06.896 --> 04:08.498
and get on with it, eh?

04:08.533 --> 04:10.066
Yep?
To Benj.

04:10.101 --> 04:11.941
Carl Williams's war
on the Carlton Crew

04:11.976 --> 04:13.506
had created chaos.

04:13.541 --> 04:16.421
The criminal world
had spun out of control.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.266
Friends had become enemies.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.541
The only way to settle a dispute
was with a bullet.

04:20.576 --> 04:21.986
Benji.
To Benji.

04:22.021 --> 04:24.581
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

04:24.616 --> 04:27.101
It really was a jungle out there.

04:27.136 --> 04:29.426
And we couldn't control it.

04:29.461 --> 04:32.381
You want someone to bump Moran
or Condello for you, I can do it.

04:32.416 --> 04:33.986
I'll do either one of them.

04:34.021 --> 04:36.021
Take out the whole fuckin'
Carlton gang if you like.

04:36.056 --> 04:38.181
Why would you wanna do that?

04:38.216 --> 04:39.626
Oh, come on, Carl.

04:39.661 --> 04:41.701
You reckon Benji put a gun
in Mick Gatto's face?

04:41.736 --> 04:43.266
There's no fuckin' way.

04:43.301 --> 04:45.461
He respected him too much,
for a start.

04:45.496 --> 04:46.906
For fuck's sake!

04:46.941 --> 04:48.861
Don't tell me you believe
that crap, do ya?

04:48.896 --> 04:49.986
Hey?

04:50.021 --> 04:52.410
Alright, mate.
I'll have a think about it, OK?

04:57.061 --> 04:59.026
Carl Williams.

04:59.061 --> 05:01.121
Honour to meet you, mate. Truly.

05:01.156 --> 05:03.146
Makes my heart swell with pride.

05:03.181 --> 05:06.121
Now, sunshine, if there's
anything I can do for you,

05:06.156 --> 05:09.061
just say the word,
'cause I'm your man - in like Flynn.

05:09.096 --> 05:10.506
With Benji dead

05:10.541 --> 05:13.341
and his other guns for hire
locked up in jail,

05:13.376 --> 05:16.106
we were hoping
Carl might call the war off.

05:16.141 --> 05:20.161
But reinforcements came crawling
out of the woodwork like maggots.

05:20.196 --> 05:24.181
Everybody knew there were still
two names on the fat boy's hit list -

05:24.216 --> 05:26.934
Mario Condello and Lewis Moran.

05:28.501 --> 05:30.821
They were living on borrowed time.

05:35.061 --> 05:38.461
# You're fucken awesome

05:38.496 --> 05:41.718
# You're fucken awesome

05:41.753 --> 05:44.947
# You're fucken awesome

05:44.982 --> 05:47.460
# You're fucken awesome

05:47.495 --> 05:49.938
# I'm just diggin' ya now

05:51.261 --> 05:53.181
# I'm diggin' ya now...

05:54.381 --> 05:56.861
# I'm just diggin' ya now

05:56.896 --> 06:00.098
# I'm diggin' ya now

06:00.133 --> 06:03.577
# Don't wanna walk away

06:03.612 --> 06:07.016
# I couldn't anyway

06:07.051 --> 06:09.976
# You fill my empty day

06:10.011 --> 06:13.296
# You know you make me stay

06:13.331 --> 06:16.581
# 'Cause you're fucken awesome

06:16.616 --> 06:19.226
# You're fucken awesome

06:19.261 --> 06:21.341
# You're fucken awesome... #

06:23.541 --> 06:25.786
Hello?

06:25.821 --> 06:28.461
Just, uh, just wondering
if you'd had a chance

06:28.496 --> 06:30.141
to think about me doing that...

06:30.176 --> 06:31.661
...thing for ya.

06:31.696 --> 06:32.746
Oh, yeah.

06:32.781 --> 06:35.981
You just say the word, right?
Any of those guys.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.781
Talk prices and... sort it out.

06:38.816 --> 06:41.426
Yeah, look, um,

06:41.461 --> 06:43.341
I'm gonna have to go with
someone more experienced.

06:43.376 --> 06:46.106
I can do this.

06:46.141 --> 06:47.706
Yeah, I know, mate.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.821
This is a business decision.

06:49.856 --> 06:51.901
I have to think with me head.

06:51.936 --> 06:53.971
Right.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.653
How was the wake?

07:01.701 --> 07:03.498
How are you?

07:08.581 --> 07:10.811
Babe, look at me.

07:12.781 --> 07:15.421
Alright, the only thing
that's real is us.

07:15.456 --> 07:18.379
That is all that matters.

07:20.021 --> 07:21.881
OK?

07:21.916 --> 07:23.806
OK.

07:23.841 --> 07:25.697
OK.

07:32.541 --> 07:35.501
I'm gonna have to go
with someone more experienced.

07:35.536 --> 07:37.786
I can do this.

07:37.821 --> 07:40.661
Yeah, I know.
It's a business decision.

07:40.696 --> 07:42.226
I've gotta think with me head.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.666
Rather than some other part
of his anatomy?

07:44.701 --> 07:48.861
Just say the word,
right? Any of those guys.

07:48.896 --> 07:51.541
Talk prices and... sort it out.

07:51.576 --> 07:53.306
Who the hell was that?

07:53.341 --> 07:54.821
Well, this number's
never called Carl before.

07:54.856 --> 07:56.861
Find out who owns that phone.

07:56.896 --> 07:58.294
I'll check it out.

08:03.461 --> 08:04.906
5:15 tomorrow?

08:04.941 --> 08:06.821
How come you blokes
keep changing my report times?

08:06.856 --> 08:08.266
It's for your own safety, Lewis.

08:08.301 --> 08:09.941
What, do you know something
I don't, Garry?

08:09.976 --> 08:11.706
We have no specific information,

08:11.741 --> 08:13.986
but common sense tells me
you're a marked man.

08:14.021 --> 08:16.026
You ought to vary your habits,
change your routine.

08:16.061 --> 08:18.781
Remember when a bloke could go about
his business in peace, Bertie?

08:18.816 --> 08:21.541
You don't want Carl Williams
being able to track you.

08:21.576 --> 08:23.826
You might as well
make it hard for the sod.

08:23.861 --> 08:25.861
That arsehole can't do nothin' to me.
There you go.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.306
Come on, mate.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.741
You want to think about
your grandkids, Lewis!

08:29.776 --> 08:31.435
They're gonna need you around.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.094
Have another shortbread, will ya?

08:36.581 --> 08:38.066
I'm telling you, mate,

08:38.101 --> 08:41.221
Benji Veniamin was lured
to his death that day.

08:41.256 --> 08:43.178
Gatto used blandishments on him.

08:43.212 --> 08:45.066
Thought it was a Smith and Wesson.

08:45.101 --> 08:48.181
Gatto couldn't pick on
someone his own size.

08:48.216 --> 08:50.306
He's a cowardly shit.

08:50.341 --> 08:51.786
You know, the way I hear it,

08:51.821 --> 08:54.301
he lured Benji with the promises
of drugs and girls

08:54.336 --> 08:56.258
and then strung him up
in the kitchen

08:56.293 --> 08:58.181
and tortured him
with cooking knives.

08:58.216 --> 08:59.773
Shit! What a dog!

09:03.741 --> 09:05.986
It upsets me when a...

09:06.021 --> 09:09.861
<i>... dear friend's good character
is abused.</i>

09:09.896 --> 09:11.858
Mick Gatto is a man of honour.

09:11.893 --> 09:13.786
I never said a word against Mick.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.901
You were heard slandering him
from here to Naples.

09:16.936 --> 09:18.826
Slander him? No way!

09:18.861 --> 09:20.772
No, me and Mick, we were...
we were mates.

09:23.661 --> 09:25.866
Mick Gatto wouldn't
wipe his bum with you.

09:25.901 --> 09:28.781
Mario, I'd heard nasty scuttlebutts
against Mick,

09:28.816 --> 09:31.661
so I took the liberty
of informing my friend of them

09:31.696 --> 09:33.438
so as he wouldn't
take them seriously.

09:33.473 --> 09:36.107
He wouldn't wipe his dog's bum
with you.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.321
I never started that rumour
about Mick.

09:38.356 --> 09:40.466
But there's plenty of sick shits
out there

09:40.501 --> 09:43.891
who don't hold you and the
Carlton Crew in the high esteem I do.

09:46.741 --> 09:49.130
Where'd you hear that?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.979
Leave it.

10:13.661 --> 10:15.541
Get your buffed arse here now.

10:15.576 --> 10:16.746
Why?

10:16.781 --> 10:19.090
To explain why you're biting
the hand that feeds you.

10:49.781 --> 10:51.737
Put it away, you fool.

10:53.901 --> 10:56.941
What, are you planning to shoot me
in front of all these people, are ya?

10:56.976 --> 10:59.546
Like Veniamin was
gonna do to Mick, huh?

10:59.581 --> 11:01.421
Benji loved Mick.
He would never have pulled...

11:01.456 --> 11:02.746
Shut up!

11:02.781 --> 11:05.906
Veniamin was a drug-addled
piece of shit

11:05.941 --> 11:08.401
that would rip off his nonna
and root his sister.

11:08.436 --> 11:10.861
He would kill anyone
for the right price, even you.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.661
You are witless and ungrateful,
my friend.

11:12.696 --> 11:14.106
Mick looked out for both of you.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.706
You should be kissing
his fuckin' arse,

11:15.741 --> 11:17.697
not running around defaming him,
telling lies.

11:31.821 --> 11:34.581
You and Veniamin,

11:34.616 --> 11:37.306
you're animals.

11:37.341 --> 11:40.021
You're all base drive and instinct.

11:40.056 --> 11:42.535
You don't think.

11:45.221 --> 11:47.610
You're not even worth a bullet.

12:03.301 --> 12:04.746
Boss?

12:04.781 --> 12:07.221
That number belongs to a phone
that was stolen months ago.

12:07.256 --> 12:09.826
Oh, so along with threat to kill,

12:09.861 --> 12:12.541
we could charge this guy,
whoever he is, with phone theft.

12:12.576 --> 12:14.861
It's been a long haul,
but we are making progress.

12:14.896 --> 12:16.852
There's been another shooting.

12:22.501 --> 12:26.581
He said it's
two men - one dead, one, uh, shot.

12:26.616 --> 12:28.186
That the dead man,

12:28.221 --> 12:31.541
I am told from my sources,
unconfirmed at this stage,

12:31.576 --> 12:33.821
is that it is Jason Moran's
father Lewis Moran,

12:33.856 --> 12:35.266
has been shot dead

12:35.301 --> 12:37.501
and that the other man
who's been shot,

12:37.536 --> 12:39.626
I'm told, is the uncle.

12:39.661 --> 12:43.581
There were two gunmen,
wearing balaclavas.

12:43.616 --> 12:47.501
They ran straight in,
straight up to him.

12:47.536 --> 12:49.412
Did these men say anything?

12:51.621 --> 12:53.179
Lewis did, though.

12:55.701 --> 12:57.339
And what did he say?

13:00.101 --> 13:02.346
He said, "I think we're off here."

13:02.381 --> 13:05.930
I'm his wife.
I'm his wife. Let me in.

13:11.621 --> 13:13.054
Stupid...

13:16.061 --> 13:19.821
You should have protected him,
you bloody useless jack!

13:19.856 --> 13:23.257
You're bloody useless,
the lot of ya!

13:32.381 --> 13:36.141
We'd all known
about Carl's vendetta for years.

13:36.176 --> 13:38.238
We still couldn't stop it.

13:38.273 --> 13:40.266
That was Purana's lowest ebb,

13:40.301 --> 13:42.941
when Garry Butterworth
almost threw in the towel.

13:42.976 --> 13:45.581
It's now got past
the amphetamines war

13:45.616 --> 13:47.106
and a territorial war.

13:47.141 --> 13:51.081
It's got to the stage now
of tit for tat,

13:51.116 --> 13:55.021
and, uh, there's
23, 24, 25 people are dead

13:55.056 --> 13:56.666
and I don't see an end of it

13:56.701 --> 13:58.746
until another four or five
have gone down.

13:58.781 --> 14:00.386
Can we have a statement?
Just anything.

14:00.421 --> 14:02.421
Thanks a lot
for bringing us that news...

14:02.456 --> 14:04.226
Carl? Come on.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.906
Where were you
when Mr Moran was shot?

14:05.941 --> 14:08.501
Here. Here. We were real shocked
when we heard, weren't we, Bobbie?

14:08.536 --> 14:11.098
Who do you think's responsible,
Detective Inspector?

14:11.133 --> 14:13.661
Well, we have no firm leads...
Was it Carl Williams?

14:13.696 --> 14:15.501
I don't think
it's helpful to speculate.

14:15.536 --> 14:16.946
Yeah, a real shock.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.221
Is it true that you have
a vendetta against the Morans?

14:19.256 --> 14:21.501
Vendetta? No, I only met Lewis
a few times.

14:21.536 --> 14:22.946
Never had any problems with him.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.946
My heart
goes out to them Morans.

14:24.981 --> 14:26.641
Are the police
just happy to sit back

14:26.676 --> 14:28.301
and let the crims
knock themselves off?

14:28.336 --> 14:29.586
Absolutely not.

14:29.621 --> 14:31.866
Where's it gonna end?

14:31.901 --> 14:34.106
And how many more people
are gonna die?

14:34.141 --> 14:35.741
We're committed to
doing everything we can

14:35.776 --> 14:37.146
to put an end to it.

14:37.181 --> 14:39.386
When are the police
gonna do anything about this?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.301
You know, like, surely they've
got some idea who's behind it.

14:42.336 --> 14:44.106
Is there anything else
you want to say?

14:44.141 --> 14:46.481
We reckon the police
should just get on with their job.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.821
Don't we, Bob? Bobbie?
What do you propose they do?

14:48.856 --> 14:50.539
I got nothin' more to say.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.139
Bobbie?

14:56.221 --> 14:57.654
Roberta!

14:59.381 --> 15:01.626
You wanna make me look like an idiot?

15:01.661 --> 15:04.733
You do that on your own.
I do everything on me bloody own!

15:09.381 --> 15:11.061
Look at this place.

15:11.096 --> 15:13.258
It's a fucking pigsty.

15:13.293 --> 15:15.421
I'm grieving. Fuck you!

15:15.456 --> 15:16.866
Grieving?

15:16.901 --> 15:19.186
You fucked my best mate

15:19.221 --> 15:21.861
and you're still
rubbing my fucking nose in it.

15:21.896 --> 15:23.986
He was my soul mate.

15:24.021 --> 15:26.694
I'm your fucking husband!

15:28.501 --> 15:31.901
Where do you think all this stuff
came from, huh? Hey?

15:31.936 --> 15:33.459
All this fucking stuff?

15:34.501 --> 15:35.946
If it wasn't for me,

15:35.981 --> 15:39.238
you'd be sucking off fuckers
in St Kilda by now.

15:39.273 --> 15:42.495
You just remember
whose fucking bed you sleep in.

16:03.661 --> 16:05.146
It's only for a while, darling.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.900
It'll be safer for you and the children
if I'm not at home.

16:09.781 --> 16:12.146
No, it's OK.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.137
Come on, no tears.

16:15.861 --> 16:17.931
I know, I know, I know.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.861
I'll be in touch.

16:22.896 --> 16:24.294
God bless.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.339
I'm doing this for them.

16:41.341 --> 16:42.774
I'm not runnin' away.

17:00.861 --> 17:03.216
How long for?
Look, I'm not sure.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.701
Well, how long did Garry
cancel leave for?

17:06.736 --> 17:08.146
Look, it's not official.

17:08.181 --> 17:10.701
I just don't think
I can take a long holiday right now.

17:10.736 --> 17:12.917
Look, we're very close
to getting Carl, OK?

17:12.953 --> 17:15.101
He's getting reckless,
he's getting feral.

17:15.136 --> 17:16.746
If I leave now...

17:16.781 --> 17:19.421
What, you might miss something?

17:19.455 --> 17:22.198
You know, it's just a job, Steve.

17:22.233 --> 17:24.906
Purana will survive without you.

17:24.941 --> 17:28.841
You know, hell, they might even
catch Carl without you.

17:28.876 --> 17:32.741
I've lived with that stupid,
ugly gangster for years.

17:32.776 --> 17:35.335
Wish you were
as sick of him as I am.

17:49.941 --> 17:51.977
Hang on. Hang on. What's that?

17:53.181 --> 17:54.660
What was that? Keep going.

17:56.181 --> 17:57.186
There.

17:57.221 --> 18:00.101
Bruise?
It's too dark.

18:00.136 --> 18:01.258
A tatt.

18:01.293 --> 18:02.346
Of what?

18:02.381 --> 18:03.781
A face, maybe?

18:03.816 --> 18:05.106
A fist?

18:05.141 --> 18:07.661
A smiley face?
Could it be a yin yang?

18:07.696 --> 18:10.218
Well, yeah,
it could be, yeah.

18:10.253 --> 18:12.706
I think I know who that is.

18:12.741 --> 18:14.546
These two get pissed
and act like dickheads,

18:14.581 --> 18:18.341
all in full view of the camera
and Lewis Moran, of all people.

18:18.376 --> 18:20.118
If you were planning
to kill someone,

18:20.153 --> 18:21.861
why go to the scene the day before?

18:21.896 --> 18:23.506
To throw us off the scent.

18:23.541 --> 18:26.661
If they're seen there earlier,
we'll assume they didn't do the murder.

18:26.696 --> 18:29.746
Bit 'stupidhead',
as my 6-year-old would say.

18:29.781 --> 18:33.221
If there was a stupid Olympics,
this tattooed scrote would win gold.

18:33.256 --> 18:34.906
So do we pick 'em up?

18:34.941 --> 18:37.681
No. A tattoo's not enough
to convict, Jacqui.

18:37.716 --> 18:40.421
But he's cunning.
He'll have a plan.

18:40.456 --> 18:41.706
What's that?

18:41.741 --> 18:44.381
Kill all the gangsters in Melbourne
and take over the city for himself?

18:44.416 --> 18:45.814
Something like that.

18:47.981 --> 18:49.426
This veteran maggot

18:49.461 --> 18:52.621
had arrived on the scene
with one ambition in mind -

18:52.656 --> 18:54.986
to see as many bodies drop
as possible,

18:55.021 --> 18:59.261
to be the one standing on the top
of the heap when the smoke cleared.

18:59.296 --> 19:03.732
Then the Melbourne drug trade
would all be his.

19:08.861 --> 19:10.586
To watch Lewis work a bus

19:10.621 --> 19:14.401
on the way back from Moonee Valley
on a Saturday afternoon...

19:14.436 --> 19:18.181
Oh, it was nothin' to see him
pinch 20, maybe 30 fat wallets.

19:19.901 --> 19:22.574
Salt of the earth. Salute!
Salute!

19:27.021 --> 19:29.501
Come on, Mario. I'll get you home.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.946
You've had enough.

19:30.981 --> 19:33.946
Ah, jacks are just sitting back

19:33.981 --> 19:38.381
while that evil bastard is
knocking us off one by one.

19:38.416 --> 19:40.849
Come on, come on.
I'll put you to bed.

19:49.501 --> 19:51.173
It is time.

19:55.101 --> 19:56.614
Time for what?

19:59.901 --> 20:01.971
Kill Carl Williams.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.414
Find me someone to do the deed.

20:17.901 --> 20:19.581
The flights
range in length,

20:19.616 --> 20:21.226
depending on the deliveries,

20:21.261 --> 20:24.461
with the longest trip
stretching over a massive 800km.

20:24.496 --> 20:25.986
The scenery is amazing...

20:26.021 --> 20:27.826
Hey, I've been thinking.
Mmm?

20:27.861 --> 20:30.216
How would you feel about maybe
getting our own place?

20:32.661 --> 20:34.661
Yeah, right. That'd be good.

20:34.696 --> 20:36.379
Yeah.
Mmm.

20:40.141 --> 20:44.261
There's a couple of apartments
for sale in that block by the station.

20:44.296 --> 20:47.301
Been having a look already,
have you?

20:47.336 --> 20:48.826
Eh?
Oh, no.

20:48.861 --> 20:52.217
No, I did... I did the conveyancing
for Mario Condello.

20:53.381 --> 20:55.741
Mario lives there?

20:55.776 --> 20:57.546
Yeah.

20:57.581 --> 20:59.826
Yeah, he moved in last week.

20:59.861 --> 21:01.701
We should have a look
at this apartment.

21:01.736 --> 21:03.341
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.376 --> 21:05.093
Let's do it.

21:07.741 --> 21:08.821
Yay.

21:12.381 --> 21:14.186
# Hey, you

21:14.221 --> 21:16.346
# You never shoulda ran

21:16.381 --> 21:20.381
# You wanna make something
that can take you down again

21:20.416 --> 21:23.106
# This time you say you're just fine

21:23.141 --> 21:27.341
# You need a little something
that can make you smile again

21:27.376 --> 21:29.906
# Come on, it won't take long

21:29.941 --> 21:34.421
# You're never gonna need it
when you hear that sound again

21:34.456 --> 21:37.301
# It's a sin,
you're lookin' kinda thin

21:37.336 --> 21:38.941
# You need a little bit... #

21:42.221 --> 21:44.106
G'day, mate.

21:44.141 --> 21:46.421
Look, I know what you said
the other day.

21:46.456 --> 21:48.106
What?

21:48.141 --> 21:49.706
But I got a new angle.

21:49.741 --> 21:52.861
If you want someone to help you
solve that problem,

21:52.896 --> 21:54.466
I can help you out.

21:54.501 --> 21:58.221
You're dating one of
the Carlton Crew solicitors.

21:58.256 --> 21:59.734
It's all about who you know.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.981
I can get to him, Carl.

22:04.016 --> 22:05.666
Simple as that.

22:05.701 --> 22:08.169
Carl, I can square the ledger
for Benji, right?

22:10.261 --> 22:11.933
Come on, mate. I can do this.

22:14.661 --> 22:16.786
OK.

22:16.821 --> 22:18.812
300 grand.

22:22.301 --> 22:23.746
Half now, half later.

22:23.781 --> 22:26.181
Nah, that's not how it works.

22:26.216 --> 22:27.906
I'll give you 10 now

22:27.941 --> 22:30.981
and you get the rest when I see
a big hole in Condello's head.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.209
Yeah, right.

22:35.581 --> 22:37.014
Lew.

22:38.981 --> 22:42.381
I'm not one of them stingy
Carlton Crew pricks, mate.

22:42.416 --> 22:44.941
I just like to see a job done first.

22:49.781 --> 22:51.817
So are we on?

23:02.501 --> 23:06.146
# Hey, you, you never shoulda ran

23:06.181 --> 23:10.181
# You wanna make something
that can take you down again

23:10.216 --> 23:13.106
# This time you say you're just fine

23:13.141 --> 23:17.341
# You need a little something
that can make you smile again

23:17.376 --> 23:20.226
# Come on, it won't take long

23:20.261 --> 23:24.221
# You're never gonna need it
when you hear that sound again

23:24.256 --> 23:27.226
# It's a sin,
you're lookin' kinda thin

23:27.261 --> 23:31.181
# You need a little bit
so you can impress everybody

23:31.216 --> 23:36.746
# Oh, oh, oh

23:36.781 --> 23:38.261
# You're still in a daze... #

23:38.296 --> 23:39.946
Whoa!
Wow!

23:39.981 --> 23:42.721
Check it out!
Ohh!

23:42.756 --> 23:44.988
Plenty of sky for you.

23:45.023 --> 23:47.186
That's amazing.

23:47.221 --> 23:49.861
I could have a study.
We could set you up a gym.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.294
Sweet.

23:52.781 --> 23:54.601
Oh, the spa.

23:54.636 --> 23:56.386
Oh! The spa!

23:56.421 --> 23:58.701
What are we on? The 34th?
What floor's Condello on again?

23:58.736 --> 24:01.226
Uh, 22nd.
Oh, good.

24:01.261 --> 24:04.571
I'll be shitting on him for a change.
Babe, forget about Mario.

24:06.632 --> 24:08.077
Have you got time

24:08.112 --> 24:09.752
to return these
to the real estate agent?

24:09.787 --> 24:12.389
Yeah, sure.
Yeah? OK.

24:12.424 --> 24:14.957
'Bye. Go.

24:14.992 --> 24:16.527
Go!
I'm going.

24:16.562 --> 24:18.063
'Bye.
'Bye.

24:31.752 --> 24:33.872
Hello?
Oh, g'day, mate. It's me.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.449
Yeah, uh, it's all sorted.

24:35.484 --> 24:36.992
It's that number again.

24:37.027 --> 24:38.425
Quick, turn it up.

24:39.752 --> 24:42.472
Well, car park, lift.
Do him in his flat.

24:42.507 --> 24:44.277
You got the hardware?

24:44.312 --> 24:46.397
Oh, yeah, it's no problem.

24:46.432 --> 24:51.192
Uh, hey, listen, I've just realised,
it's not a one-man job, really.

24:51.227 --> 24:53.229
Thought you said you could do it?

24:53.264 --> 24:55.197
Oh, I can do it. I CAN do it.

24:55.232 --> 24:56.877
I just need some backup, that's all.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.072
Look, you want to subcontract, mate.
That's up to you.

24:59.107 --> 25:00.546
The fee's the same.

25:00.581 --> 25:01.985
Is there anyone...

25:03.632 --> 25:05.752
...anyone you had in mind, or...

25:05.787 --> 25:06.997
Who is that?

25:07.032 --> 25:09.023
...anyone you'd recommend?

25:14.192 --> 25:17.072
Alright, so the driver stays in the car,
operates the security grille.

25:17.107 --> 25:19.169
Two of us go upstairs and do the job.

25:19.204 --> 25:21.197
I can do it, it's just with the lift,

25:21.232 --> 25:23.512
the corridors, other tenants,
it's too risky for one.

25:23.547 --> 25:26.072
Yeah, easy for three, but.
Yeah.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.997
The driver gets 50 grand.

25:28.032 --> 25:30.232
Yeah, that'd be Jackie Chan here.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.484
Backup gets 100.
Moi.

25:32.519 --> 25:34.701
And I do Condello.

25:36.072 --> 25:38.637
Yeah, I saw you at Benji's wake.

25:38.672 --> 25:40.628
Been wanting to avenge
the little bloke myself.

25:43.952 --> 25:45.992
Benji never mentioned
you and him were mates.

25:46.027 --> 25:47.437
Oh, yeah.

25:47.472 --> 25:49.622
Peas in a frickin' pod.

25:52.312 --> 25:55.065
Fat boy Williams
put a contract out on you.

25:56.632 --> 25:58.077
Yeah, I can tell
you're shocked, mate.

25:58.112 --> 26:00.312
I think it's atrocious too,
this tit for tat.

26:00.347 --> 26:02.629
Getting out of hand completely.

26:02.664 --> 26:04.912
City's not safe for anyone anymore.

26:04.947 --> 26:07.437
When will it end?

26:07.472 --> 26:08.917
I'll tell you when it'll end, mate.

26:08.952 --> 26:11.512
It'll end when someone puts a slug
through Williams's sluggy tummy.

26:11.547 --> 26:14.424
And I'm here to offer to be
the guy who slugs him for you.

26:16.152 --> 26:18.352
Who's Williams using on me,
do you know?

26:18.387 --> 26:20.024
Lew Caine.

26:21.992 --> 26:24.072
That fuckin' ingrate.

26:24.107 --> 26:25.837
Yeah, I know.

26:25.872 --> 26:27.464
Outrageous after all
you've done for him.

26:29.192 --> 26:31.277
Why don't I see
what I can do about Caine?

26:31.312 --> 26:34.952
He's not going to get you
if he's already been got, is he?

26:34.987 --> 26:36.912
I think it's important
to clear the air,

26:36.947 --> 26:38.425
get rid of the bits of shit.

26:45.032 --> 26:48.157
Well, look, I, um,

26:48.192 --> 26:50.103
I appreciate the offer,
mate, but...

26:51.392 --> 26:53.557
<i>... cash flow's a bit of a problem
at the moment.</i>

26:53.592 --> 26:55.232
You know, the market's down
and business disruptions...

26:55.267 --> 26:56.757
Mario, I'm not...

26:56.792 --> 27:00.592
I'm not a greedy man and I want
to do the right thing by you.

27:00.627 --> 27:02.662
50 grand would see the job done.

27:04.512 --> 27:06.707
45, even.

28:31.272 --> 28:33.277
I forgot.
The real estate agent called again.

28:33.312 --> 28:36.032
They didn't get back that swipe card
that opens the garage.

28:36.067 --> 28:37.949
You know, the swipe card.
I don't know!

28:37.984 --> 28:39.624
Are you sure?
Don't know what to tell you.

28:39.659 --> 28:41.265
They're worried about security,
that's all.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.544
I think we should have a baby.

28:51.072 --> 28:52.517
Sorry? I thought you said...

28:52.552 --> 28:55.192
I could have sworn you said,
"I think we should have a baby."

28:55.227 --> 28:56.910
That was really weird.

29:01.632 --> 29:04.312
You don't want to have
a baby with me.

29:04.347 --> 29:05.745
You don't know who I am.

29:08.912 --> 29:12.292
Why wouldn't I want to have a baby
with you?

29:12.327 --> 29:15.672
Of course I want
to have a baby with you.

29:15.707 --> 29:17.185
Really?

30:05.432 --> 30:08.272
Well, that number there
hasn't called Carl for three days

30:08.307 --> 30:09.717
and he hasn't called it.

30:09.752 --> 30:11.592
You can see there's
a definite pattern going on.

30:11.627 --> 30:13.037
Before Marshall was shot,

30:13.072 --> 30:15.312
Carl called the Running Man
four to five times a day

30:15.347 --> 30:17.277
and he'd call Carl nearly as often.

30:17.312 --> 30:20.672
Then four days out before the hit,
all calls between them stop.

30:20.707 --> 30:22.232
And the same thing happened
before Jason.

30:22.267 --> 30:24.072
And with Benji before he hit Radev.

30:24.107 --> 30:25.597
So Carl's across the planning

30:25.632 --> 30:28.552
but before the actual murder,
he distances himself.

30:28.587 --> 30:31.169
Well, we can guess
who the next target'll be.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.752
All we've got to do
is find him before they do.

30:33.787 --> 30:35.868
Find me Condello.

30:39.512 --> 30:41.952
You're going to the pub
with that brainless sicko?

30:41.987 --> 30:43.397
Oh, he's alright.

30:43.432 --> 30:46.052
He just likes to pump up
his own tyres, that's all.

30:46.087 --> 30:48.672
Why are you going?
I'm just going to have a drink.

30:48.707 --> 30:50.752
Alright. Well, will you be home late?

30:50.787 --> 30:52.517
Oh, no, no. Shouldn't be.

30:52.552 --> 30:54.991
Outside doesn't matter, Zarah.

30:55.026 --> 30:57.431
It's only you and me that matters.

31:02.072 --> 31:03.505
I love ya.

32:07.672 --> 32:09.117
So, you up for this, boys?

32:09.152 --> 32:11.792
Need the cash.
I lost a stack on the doggies.

32:11.827 --> 32:14.432
Well, you'll make it back tonight,
won't ya?

32:14.467 --> 32:15.437
Your shout.

32:15.472 --> 32:17.592
No, I don't want to
get too pissed. Fuck that.

32:17.627 --> 32:19.583
Get yourself a light, then.

32:22.152 --> 32:24.197
Come on, it's time.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

32:24.232 --> 32:26.597
We'll get a pizza first.
We're not gonna get pizza. Come on.

32:26.632 --> 32:30.312
Plenty of time. You said so yourself,
Condello never goes out after 10pm.

32:30.347 --> 32:32.317
The idea's to get him
before he goes to bed.

32:32.352 --> 32:34.992
I think I've whacked a few more
wankers than you in my time.

32:35.027 --> 32:36.509
There's only one wanker around here.

32:36.544 --> 32:37.992
Can we go?
Ooh-hoo. Ladies first.

32:38.027 --> 32:39.677
After you.
Ladies...

32:39.712 --> 32:42.952
Oh, that's right. You're Fulham
Prison's answer to the Karate Kid.

32:42.987 --> 32:45.157
Yeah, I kept fit and didn't
stuff my face with pizza.

32:45.192 --> 32:48.632
Yeah, well fuck fitness. When I was
in the boob I won on technique.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.512
Is that right? What's his technique?
Blowing hot air?

32:50.547 --> 32:52.184
Smash him.

32:57.312 --> 32:58.745
What are you fuckin'...

33:01.112 --> 33:03.232
Got any more, sweetheart, or what?

33:03.267 --> 33:04.426
Hey?

33:08.232 --> 33:10.512
Alright! OK, drop off.

33:10.547 --> 33:11.517
Drop off!

33:11.552 --> 33:14.752
You want some more, or can we
go do a job we came to do, eh?

33:14.787 --> 33:16.868
Can we go do our fuckin' job now,
or what?

33:18.312 --> 33:19.904
Too much to ask?

33:24.192 --> 33:27.232
I guess I got you pretty good,
didn't I?

33:27.267 --> 33:28.357
Eh?

33:28.392 --> 33:29.957
Don't worry about it, mate.

33:29.992 --> 33:31.592
You're just getting on, that's all.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.389
You know, over the hill.

33:37.632 --> 33:39.270
So can we do this thing or what?

33:44.112 --> 33:46.957
Who's over the hill now, fuckwit?!

33:46.992 --> 33:49.552
You didn't see that comin',
did ya, pretty boy?!

33:49.587 --> 33:50.877
Uncle...

33:50.912 --> 33:52.892
Yeah, that's how
a real gangster does it.

33:52.927 --> 33:54.872
Not just a 'think you're so good'
gym junkie!

33:54.907 --> 33:55.917
Uncle!
What?

33:55.952 --> 33:58.032
I thought we were gonna
kill him down the docks

33:58.067 --> 34:00.752
so we wouldn't have to dump the car!

34:00.787 --> 34:02.902
Shit!

34:25.712 --> 34:28.748
God.
Shotgun at close range, I'd say.

34:29.911 --> 34:31.877
Daresay
his prints'll be on file.

34:31.911 --> 34:33.397
A cleanskin doesn't get
killed like this.

34:33.431 --> 34:36.583
Black jeans, black gloves.
I'd say that he liked his basic black.

34:39.431 --> 34:41.592
There's no wallet.

34:41.627 --> 34:43.071
Oh, hang on.

34:52.472 --> 34:55.831
The number
you have dialled is 04151...

34:55.867 --> 34:57.277
<i>Shit. Give me...
... 0...</i>

34:57.312 --> 34:59.252
<i>This guy's our mystery caller.
... 616.</i>

34:59.287 --> 35:01.157
Hey? What?
If you'd like to leave...

35:01.192 --> 35:03.912
This is the number - the one
that's been calling Carl.

35:03.947 --> 35:05.789
Carl's new hit man.

35:20.312 --> 35:22.352
We have this
as the registered address

35:22.387 --> 35:24.597
of a Mr Lewis Caine.

35:24.632 --> 35:27.783
I'm very sorry.
He's been involved in an accident.

35:44.632 --> 35:46.384
When did you last see Lewis?

35:47.712 --> 35:49.752
Um, last night.

35:49.787 --> 35:51.265
Mm-hm.

35:52.512 --> 35:55.207
I should have said, "Don't go."

35:55.242 --> 35:57.902
I should have said, "Don't go out."

36:00.552 --> 36:02.677
Not with him.

36:02.712 --> 36:05.146
And who did he go out with?

36:06.672 --> 36:08.952
Now, you say
that you met Mr Caine

36:08.987 --> 36:10.949
because he wanted to buy your car.

36:10.984 --> 36:12.877
Yeah, and he took it for a spin

36:12.912 --> 36:15.432
and that was the last I saw of him,
or my vehicle.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.637
That's the four-wheel drive
Ford Explorer

36:17.672 --> 36:19.952
we've since found burnt out
in Port Melbourne?

36:19.987 --> 36:21.757
Phew.

36:21.792 --> 36:25.148
It's almost new,
so that's a tragedy.

36:31.632 --> 36:34.432
Look, I don't know what happened
to Caine after he left.

36:34.467 --> 36:37.390
I mean, we just...
we just drove back to Geelong.

36:38.792 --> 36:41.352
What time did you get there?

36:41.387 --> 36:43.197
10pm.

36:43.232 --> 36:46.037
What time was Lew killed?

36:46.072 --> 36:47.832
We have your phone records here

36:47.867 --> 36:49.317
and this statement claims

36:49.352 --> 36:54.232
that you made a call
to Geelong at 10:08pm.

36:54.267 --> 36:56.797
A call from Brunswick.

36:56.832 --> 36:58.397
A call that went through
a transmitter tower

36:58.432 --> 37:01.472
situated half a K from
where Lewis Caine's body was found.

37:01.507 --> 37:04.111
OK, look. Just give me a sec.

37:07.432 --> 37:09.517
OK.

37:09.552 --> 37:11.517
No bullshit.

37:11.552 --> 37:13.392
When we were at the pub,
Caine's all cool.

37:13.427 --> 37:15.197
But as soon as we get in the car,

37:15.232 --> 37:17.912
he pulls a gun,
saying we're dead meat.

37:17.947 --> 37:19.437
So...

37:19.472 --> 37:20.917
<i>... in fear of his own life,</i>

37:20.952 --> 37:24.592
my buddy wrestled the gun
from Caine's grip

37:24.627 --> 37:26.477
and in the ensuing struggle,

37:26.512 --> 37:30.664
it accidentally went off
and he shot him.

37:32.832 --> 37:36.108
And, foolishly, I then agreed
to assist him

37:36.143 --> 37:39.385
in the dumping of the body
in the alley.

37:40.832 --> 37:42.917
And the disposing of the car.

37:42.952 --> 37:46.661
And the bit about him
wanting to buy it.

37:47.912 --> 37:48.947
Right.

37:50.712 --> 37:52.350
So where's the gun?

37:54.552 --> 37:56.270
OK.

37:57.552 --> 37:59.031
Just give me a sec.

38:01.712 --> 38:03.832
We'd let
the veteran maggot run

38:03.867 --> 38:05.952
in hope he'd lead us back to Carl.

38:05.987 --> 38:06.957
Wrong call.

38:06.992 --> 38:09.197
We had our 29th dead body.

38:09.232 --> 38:12.191
But at least we'd taken
two more gunmen off the street.

38:12.226 --> 38:15.150
There was a glimmer of light
at the end of the tunnel.

38:17.032 --> 38:19.197
Zarah made a request
to the Coroner's Court

38:19.232 --> 38:23.512
to have sperm taken from Lew Caine's
body after the autopsy.

38:23.547 --> 38:25.117
Amazingly, they granted it,

38:25.152 --> 38:28.032
but his family launched
an injunction against her.

38:28.067 --> 38:30.232
Still stands today.

38:35.952 --> 38:37.552
Hi,
you've called Lew and Zarah.

38:37.587 --> 38:39.757
Leave us a message.

38:39.792 --> 38:43.152
Zarah, g'day. It's Carl Williams.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.637
We haven't met before,

38:44.672 --> 38:47.630
but I just wanted to say
how sorry I was to hear about Lew.

38:48.752 --> 38:50.947
He was a really lovely bloke.

38:53.272 --> 38:55.228
I reckon them Carlton Crew pricks
have got it comin'.

38:56.632 --> 39:00.552
Just gotta hope we can trust
the cops to sort it out.

39:00.587 --> 39:03.077
Anyway, if you ever need anything,

39:03.112 --> 39:07.632
you want to talk to someone,
just give us a ring.

39:07.667 --> 39:09.065
Cheers.

39:10.752 --> 39:12.504
Hey, babe?

39:16.152 --> 39:17.952
Do you want a beer?

39:17.987 --> 39:19.385
Thanks, darl.

39:36.552 --> 39:39.917
# Hey, you, you never shoulda ran

39:39.952 --> 39:44.192
# You wanna make something
that can take you down again

39:44.227 --> 39:47.037
# This time you say you're just fine

39:47.072 --> 39:51.272
# You need a little something
that can make you smile again

39:51.307 --> 39:54.197
# Come on, it won't take long

39:54.232 --> 39:57.632
# You're never gonna need it
when you hear that sound again

39:57.667 --> 40:01.317
# It's a sin,
you're lookin' kinda thin

40:01.352 --> 40:05.152
# You need a little bit
so you can impress everybody

40:05.187 --> 40:10.477
# Oh, oh, oh

40:10.512 --> 40:13.549
# You're still in a daze

40:18.992 --> 40:22.157
# Hey, you, I know you like to prance

40:22.192 --> 40:26.472
# So get up on and dance
so I can spin you round again

40:26.507 --> 40:29.557
# Take your time,
you're lookin' just fine

40:29.592 --> 40:33.512
# Let's do a little shuffle
that can make you smile again

40:33.547 --> 40:36.557
# Come on, it won't take long

40:36.592 --> 40:40.712
# Let's sing a little song
until the sun don't shine again

40:40.747 --> 40:43.637
# But every time
you say you're just fine

40:43.672 --> 40:47.152
# You need a little bit
so you can impress everybody

40:47.187 --> 40:52.877
# Oh, oh, oh

40:52.912 --> 40:55.665
# You're still in a daze... #

41:00.952 --> 41:03.532
Garry's tattooed scrote
and his little mate

41:03.567 --> 41:06.112
were found guilty of the murder
of Lew Caine

41:06.147 --> 41:07.677
and sentenced to life imprisonment

41:07.712 --> 41:11.792
with non-parole periods of 19 years
and 15 years respectively.

41:11.827 --> 41:13.757
Caine had died for nothing.

41:13.792 --> 41:17.117
In June, 2005,
Mick Gatto was found not guilty

41:17.152 --> 41:20.189
of murdering Andrew 'Benji' Veniamin
and acquitted.
