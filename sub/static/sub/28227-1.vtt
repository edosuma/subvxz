[Mark]<i> If I'm being honest,</i>
<i> even now I come across</i>
<i> like a lobotomized hamster</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:45.177
<i> when it comes</i>
<i> to approaching women</i>

00:45.179 --> 00:51.350
<i> and at the age of 12</i>
<i> having just blossomed</i>
<i>into an idiot, I knew even less.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:56.388
-What are you doing?
-Uh hi, Connie.
I wrote this for you.

00:57.625 --> 01:01.160
Every day you're on my mind,
I love the way you laugh.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.661
I promise to always
treat you kind,

01:02.663 --> 01:04.496
like you're my better half.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.498
I'll keep you close to my heart

01:06.500 --> 01:09.201
you will always be
and hope we're never apart,

01:09.203 --> 01:10.436
forever you and me.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.439
What do you think?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.707
[rock music]

01:16.677 --> 01:20.179
[laughter]

01:21.482 --> 01:23.082
Ugh!

[religious choral singing]

01:31.192 --> 01:34.593
[priest] People who walk
in darkness, will see
a great light. Amen.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.698
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.769
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:45.573 --> 01:49.775
Jesus said to them:
"I am the bread of life,
whoever comes to me

01:49.777 --> 01:55.714
will never be hungry,
and whoever believes in me
will never be thirsty."

01:55.716 --> 01:57.616
Blah, blah, blah.

01:58.853 --> 02:01.453
[Mark]<i> That kid that was beating</i>
<i> on me all those years ago,</i>

02:01.455 --> 02:02.688
<i> this is his funeral.</i>

02:02.690 --> 02:04.590
<i> His epitaph would have read</i>

02:04.592 --> 02:09.862
<i> Here lies Tommy. He was</i>
<i> an asshole, calm as a bitch,</i>

02:09.864 --> 02:13.198
<i> but my anonymous</i>
<i> suggestion was ignored.</i>

02:14.502 --> 02:20.305
Anyway, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust,

02:20.307 --> 02:21.707
et cetera, et cetera.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.145
Mazel tov, amen.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.548
Obviously he never said that
because none of this is true.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.786
Did you enjoy that? Yeah?

02:34.788 --> 02:36.455
-This is my girlfriend, Daniela.
-[Daniella] Hi.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.756
[Kendra] Nice to meet
you, Daniela.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.191
Have a nice time
I'll be back in a minute.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.159
[Daniella] Sure.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.831
Hello, granddad.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.832
Johnny.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.905
Surprised to see you here.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.606
-Well, I couldn't believe
he was dead.
-Hmm.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.641
I had to make sure.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.776
-Hi.
-Tim.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.444
-Daniela, nice to meet you.
-How you doing there,
how you doing.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.747
-How have you been, Johnny?
-Yeah,

03:01.749 --> 03:05.184
damn good, mate. Absolutely
fucking, spot on, actually.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.818
Working as a legal consultant

03:06.820 --> 03:09.321
tearing the ass out of my
gorgeous girlfriend over there,

03:09.323 --> 03:11.757
life couldn't be
fucking sweeter.

03:11.759 --> 03:15.861
-Did you come with anyone?
-Yes, do you see that
chinless twat over there?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.896
-Who's the oaf?
-That's my flatmate.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.766
You brought your
flatmate to a funeral?

03:22.236 --> 03:25.404
To be honest, he just kind of
goes wherever there's free food.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.638
Why don't you go
and talk to her?

03:28.842 --> 03:30.442
Of course,
she won't remember you.

03:30.444 --> 03:34.646
Ah, having said that
I only recognized you
when you started crying.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.848
Oh, I didn't, I didn't--

03:36.850 --> 03:39.384
I've got some vouchers
from my nan,

03:39.386 --> 03:41.753
that's it.
I mean, not enough to go.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.355
-[Mark] Tim. Tim!
-But you have credit cards.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.457
-One second.
-Someone I want you to meet.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.658
Keep saving.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.260
Hello, Tim.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.296
How are you doing.
So, here's the skinny.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.632
So, the self-obsessed
duckface over there,

03:53.634 --> 03:55.934
was the soon
to be widow fat bloke.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.270
Apparently,
he was fucking loaded.

03:58.272 --> 04:02.274
Good looking girl over there,
she's engaged to the Ken Doll,

04:02.276 --> 04:04.543
and the hotty, right,
she's an escort.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.645
-She's here
with some chinless prat, right.
-No.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.746
-Yes.
-I just can't work out
which one.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.747
-Tim.
-No, no, no.

04:08.749 --> 04:09.881
Thank you.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.817
Ah, so girlfriend, eh?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.385
I didn't want to come standing.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.386
Oh, so you thought
you'd come with a hooker

04:14.388 --> 04:15.687
to avoid embarrassment.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.456
She's an escort,
there's a difference.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.992
Okay, I'm going to leave you two
to get better acquainted.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.298
[woman] That was
a lovely service, Father.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.000
Breaks my heart in two
having lost him,

04:28.002 --> 04:31.303
but at least I know he's
at peace up there in heaven.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.640
Oh sure, he's probably skipping
along with Father Christmas

04:34.642 --> 04:36.808
and the Easter Bunny right now.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.910
Connie, hi.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.046
I just heard that you
and uh, Tommy were together

04:41.048 --> 04:43.682
I just wanted to, you know,
offer my condolences.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.850
Thanks.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.686
Such a pointless,
senseless waste.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.054
Tommy dying?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.555
Yah, that too.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.391
Um, took me by surprise,
to be honest,

04:52.393 --> 04:53.892
didn't realize
that he was your type.

04:53.894 --> 04:57.296
Right,
[chuckles] and who are you?

04:58.999 --> 05:03.302
Mark, we went to school
together for eight years.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.803
I don't remember
Tommy mentioning you,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.406
but thank you
so much for coming.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.608
Hey, if you, uh,
if you ever want to catch up,

05:09.610 --> 05:11.310
if you need a shoulder
to cry on.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.744
You know, I'm, I'm always here
if you need me.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.646
Sorry, Martin,
I don't know who you are...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.014
I'm Mark.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.449
...but are you seriously
making moves on me

05:17.451 --> 05:19.551
at my boyfriend's funeral?

05:19.553 --> 05:22.421
That's not what I was--
I was just saying that if you--

05:22.423 --> 05:25.023
Uh, I'm going to leave.
He-- Here's my card.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.959
I'm Mark, Mark Walwyn.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.362
-Um, just give me a call
anytime you need a--
-No.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.832
I'm gonna-- It's not
a proposition, I'm-- Tim!

05:35.769 --> 05:37.035
Nice to meet you, chinless.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.937
[music]

05:38.939 --> 05:40.672
Hmph...

05:44.645 --> 05:46.044
My deepest condolences.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.015
Just remember that
Tony's in a better place now.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.817
-Who is Tony?
-Whatever.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.118
[music]

05:55.689 --> 05:57.389
Fucking hell.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.791
Now, Mark, can I borrow Â£ 100,

05:59.793 --> 06:02.461
'cause that escort
doesn't take a fiver,
I can tell you that.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.997
Tommy would be
rolling in his grave,
if he knew Mark had turned up.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.900
-Mark who?
-The wanker
you were just talking to.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.802
-Oh.
-Oh you remember,

06:10.804 --> 06:12.771
he was the one that sent you
that pathetic poem.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.374
I mean-- Tommy ended up beating
him up for the next six years.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.410
-Oh my god, that was him?
-Huh-huh, yeah.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.412
-Why was he here?
-Well, I don't know, Connie.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.513
What's that?

06:21.515 --> 06:22.748
His card.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.485
-You're kidding me.
-What?

06:27.855 --> 06:29.020
My client,
they're trying to buy this.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.757
It's a-- it's a startup company.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.960
-So?
-They're trying to buy it
for 20 million!

06:36.630 --> 06:37.629
Really?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.865
[music]

06:44.405 --> 06:47.672
[theme music]

06:49.042 --> 06:51.443
[background chatter]

06:54.014 --> 06:55.680
[Mark] Thank you so much.

06:55.682 --> 06:59.050
-Thank you. Chin-chin.
-Cheers.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.118
Dead people.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.854
To funerals.

07:02.856 --> 07:03.922
Ahh.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.690
On a scale of 1-10,

07:05.692 --> 07:07.759
how successful
was your little meeting earlier?

07:08.729 --> 07:11.663
About a three.
She didn't even remember me.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.032
Aw, well yeah,
you are very forgettable.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.204
How the hell does someone
like Mark make 20 million?

07:19.206 --> 07:22.941
-By being a boring
sad fucking nerd.
-[sighs]

07:24.611 --> 07:28.013
He's gonna waste it
on computers and porn.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.648
Do something about it then.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.982
What's so great about her?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.951
It's hard to qualify really.

07:32.953 --> 07:39.124
She just-- She was always so
interesting, you know, just
always made me laugh.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.994
Well, it's not exactly
the greatest stretch

07:42.996 --> 07:45.664
of the imagination to presume
in certain circumstances,

07:45.666 --> 07:47.899
a gold-digger such as yourself

07:47.901 --> 07:51.169
could relieve a moron,
such as Mark,

07:52.005 --> 07:53.104
of half his money.

07:54.641 --> 07:55.707
-You mean--
-Uhuh...

07:56.710 --> 07:58.577
Marry him.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.979
Ugh, I don't want to marry
someone I'm not in love with.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.515
Of course, of course, of course.
I know you're not
in love with him,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.985
but let's say hypothetically

08:06.987 --> 08:09.754
you could love 10 million,
couldn't you? [kissing]

08:10.891 --> 08:12.591
Hypothetically...

08:13.260 --> 08:14.893
I could love 10 million.

08:14.895 --> 08:18.663
Exactly, that's what I thought.
Mm.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.598
Johnny?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.099
Yes, sugar-tits.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.903
Get your hands off me.

08:24.905 --> 08:25.871
Right.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.808
Well, it could be worse, yeah?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.911
You could be like him,
with a gold-digger on your arm.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.647
Sorry.
He doesn't look too unhappy.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.116
Hey, mate, are you happy?

08:38.118 --> 08:39.084
Yes.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.221
Ignorance is bliss, innit?

08:43.223 --> 08:47.559
I wouldn't want to be with
someone who's only with me
for my money, would you?

08:47.561 --> 08:49.828
No, I wouldn't want
to be alone either.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.530
That would justify it?

08:51.532 --> 08:53.765
If he's happy,
why does he have to justify it?

08:58.305 --> 08:59.905
Ah, Mate.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.275
Fuck off, you deserve that.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.911
Go on, the door's that way.
Off you go.

09:14.555 --> 09:18.924
[music]

09:26.099 --> 09:27.599
Hi, is that Mark?

09:27.601 --> 09:29.200
[Mark]<i> Yes, hi.</i>

09:34.007 --> 09:38.209
Would you be,
free to meet up at all?

09:38.211 --> 09:40.278
<i> Yeah, I'll meet up.</i>
<i> That sounds great.</i>

09:41.114 --> 09:43.114
Good, thank you.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.150
They'll see you now,
just go to the fourth floor.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.084
Thank you.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.620
[upbeat music]

09:54.161 --> 09:57.028
Amazing! Okay, great,
then I'll see you on Tuesday.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.598
[music]

10:18.852 --> 10:19.918
[knocking on the window]

10:21.254 --> 10:22.387
Fuck off.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.927
Because time dilation
right close to a black hole
is a maximum of 50%.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.630
So, that doesn't make any sense
that they would be there
for 30 years,

10:31.632 --> 10:32.998
whilst they're
down there 40 minutes.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.167
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, why?

10:36.169 --> 10:39.971
-Your eye's twitching a lot.
-Is it?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.140
You're not having a stroke,
are you? [sarcastic chuckle]

10:42.142 --> 10:44.009
No, it's probably just pink eye.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.079
I don't have pink eye.
I don't have any STDs, I don't--

10:50.017 --> 10:51.049
Hi.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.184
Yes, great, thank you.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.420
That, I'm just surprised
that you called me.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.689
Really, why?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.324
Because I could hear myself

10:59.326 --> 11:03.728
and I sound stupid
and I'm clearly floundering.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.731
Just, just, just relax,
just be yourself.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.668
Thank you, thank you so much.

11:12.906 --> 11:13.972
Thanks.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.413
Uh.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.447
Yeah, it's lovely.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.883
Good, glad you approve.

11:24.885 --> 11:25.950
I do.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.021
Thank you.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.356
Thank you so much.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.459
See the point is that uh,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.128
well, we haven't spoken
for 12 years,

11:37.130 --> 11:41.366
and, um, I mean there must be
a reason why

11:41.368 --> 11:44.969
because y--, y--,
you know I liked you.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.337
Mark, you're a nice guy.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.441
Oh no, not-- don't call me
a nice guy.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.943
Not the whole,
it's not you, it's me thing.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.746
No, it's not me, it is you.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.381
What?

11:56.383 --> 11:59.984
Mark, I really liked you.

11:59.986 --> 12:04.255
I never wanted you to be
the kind of guy that let life
slip through their fingers.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.126
If Tommy's passing taught me
anything, it's that

12:08.128 --> 12:09.961
life's short.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.831
If there's something you want,

12:15.368 --> 12:16.468
you've gotta take it.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.406
What are you doing?

12:22.309 --> 12:23.441
What do you think?

12:23.443 --> 12:26.311
I mean, if I'm misreading things

12:26.313 --> 12:28.046
that's very embarrassing for me.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.814
I think that ship's sailed.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.318
Has it?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.889
ApÃ©ritif--

12:37.891 --> 12:39.090
-Just kiss me, Mark.
-Yes!

12:39.092 --> 12:40.325
-[glass clangs]
-[Mark] Oh.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.532
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.436
Excuse me, thank you. Hey.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.982
Thank you, thank you so much.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.262
Just a little drop, ahh.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.430
[sniffs] You're fine.

13:20.867 --> 13:24.569
So the reason I--
I did the second glass of wine,

13:24.571 --> 13:27.138
uh, was because,

13:27.140 --> 13:32.243
didn't want it to stain,
hence the white wine.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.313
Uh, I realize
you're not a carpet.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.415
No.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.517
So--

13:40.921 --> 13:42.554
I fucked that one up, didn't I?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.859
At least it wasn't
flaming Sambucas!

13:49.229 --> 13:50.228
Mark.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.232
[uplifting romantic music]

14:08.281 --> 14:09.247
Yes.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.552
[romantic uplifting song]

15:43.343 --> 15:48.212
Connie, you once told me that
if there's something in life
that you want,

15:48.214 --> 15:51.382
you have to take it, and I'm uh,

15:53.353 --> 15:55.453
uh... I'm crazy about you

15:55.455 --> 15:58.623
and uh, tonight I'm
hoping that one little word--

15:58.625 --> 16:00.391
[snaps the box closed] Yes.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.428
But I uh, I wrote this whole uh,

16:03.430 --> 16:04.629
this um--

16:06.733 --> 16:10.101
Ugh, Mark, you're so sweet.
Come here.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.005
Thank you.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.718
That's how I always pictured it.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.052
Me too.

16:29.990 --> 16:34.292
[Mark] Tim, we've been friends
now for-- I don't know.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.028
But in that time,
we've always been there
for each other, haven't we?

16:37.030 --> 16:40.231
Friends is a very strong word,
but, yes, flatmates,

16:40.233 --> 16:42.467
we've always been very
supportive of each other.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.202
So, on my special day,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.471
when I have the love of my life
on one side,

16:47.340 --> 16:52.643
nothing would make me prouder
than to have my best um,
flatmate on the other.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.579
I suppose it makes sense.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.615
So, the question
I want to ask you, Timmy...

16:59.285 --> 17:03.154
Tim, is-- will you do me
the honor of being my best man?

17:03.156 --> 17:05.623
Yeah, all right,
just give me my hand back.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.158
Give me a hug, you big tit.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.627
Aw, that was easy.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.130
Well, in my capacity as best man

17:12.132 --> 17:16.067
I'm going to ask you
to reconsider marrying her.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.569
-What?
-Now--

17:18.571 --> 17:22.106
I'd like to draw your attention
to some information
I've had compiled.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.374
[chuckles] What is this?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.211
She's a bit of a shit.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.480
You can't call her
a bit of a shit, Tim.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.615
She's my fiancÃ©.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.583
Well, I'm duty bound

17:32.585 --> 17:35.253
to make you fully aware
that you're about
to marry a shit.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.089
She's not a shit, she's awesome.

17:38.091 --> 17:42.393
Is she though?
I mean, look at the evidence
it's there in black and white.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.762
Look, you just don't know her
the way I do,

17:44.764 --> 17:46.631
okay, she's wonderful.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.201
She's made me happier
than I've ever been, okay?

17:50.203 --> 17:53.271
Been very inconvenient for me,
booted out of the flat.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.772
Well, I was being
cruel to be kind.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.641
You should
spread your wings a little

17:56.643 --> 17:58.509
you couldn't sleep on my couch
for the rest of your life.

17:58.511 --> 18:01.212
Cruel to be kind.
You're just being a twat
to be selfish.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.848
The only reason you wanted me
out of the flat,

18:03.850 --> 18:08.186
was so you could strut around
naked, balls flapping around,

18:08.188 --> 18:10.254
and have sex in the lounge.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.090
Yes, I was, I did, and I have.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.158
What was it like?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.526
Great.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.694
Lucky.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.396
Yeah.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.530
What do you think, Ducky?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.799
Ducky, is that a chicken leg?

18:21.801 --> 18:27.538
Chicken leg. Chicken leg.
It's a chicken leg,
it's a chicken leg.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.806
[Ducky growls]

18:28.808 --> 18:30.608
-Chicken leg.
-Aw, Ha, oh god.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.576
What a brute.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.411
What a brute!

18:33.413 --> 18:35.780
[music]

18:37.650 --> 18:39.283
Here you go.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.384
Thanks.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.126
That's expensive wine.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.227
Thank you.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.661
So, I was thinking,

18:50.663 --> 18:52.530
what if we got married
in six weeks?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.333
-Sure.
-Really?

18:55.335 --> 18:57.235
Get married before, if you want.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.303
Whatever, if you can
find a church that's free.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.238
Okay.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.875
You put any thought into
who you want to be
your maid of honor?

19:03.877 --> 19:05.576
Yes, my sister.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.879
Oh, [inhales]
could she go on holy ground?

19:09.215 --> 19:11.415
Nothing funny about
a pigmentation problem, Mark.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.550
She's not a vampire!

19:12.552 --> 19:14.318
Okay. [chuckles]

19:14.320 --> 19:17.255
I just thought it'd be Kendra,
I like her, she's great.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.223
Well, maybe
you should marry her instead.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.558
No, I just thought
she'd be your first--

19:20.560 --> 19:22.160
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mark!

19:22.162 --> 19:23.661
Will you stop
talking about the wedding.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.595
Shut up!

19:24.597 --> 19:27.165
[soft music]

19:37.177 --> 19:39.243
Oh, uh, hi.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.578
I'm sorry, baby.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.650
Mm.

19:45.652 --> 19:49.654
I'm just adjusting.
It's all very new for me.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.289
Don't be mad at me.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.791
Well I'm-- you know,
I'm not entirely sure

19:53.793 --> 19:56.294
you should be... unpunished.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.897
I'm ready for anything.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.934
Whatever you want to give me.

20:02.936 --> 20:03.834
Okay.

20:03.836 --> 20:04.769
[phone ringing]

20:04.771 --> 20:06.938
No, no don't--

20:06.940 --> 20:10.541
Hello, oh hi!
No, I hadn't heard about that.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.509
Tell me, tell me!

20:13.279 --> 20:14.845
[exhales] Blue balls.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.748
Don't look at me!

It's a done deal, I reckon.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.335
Once you marry, you'll be able
to get at least half,
if not more.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.938
Especially if you can prove
that he's been a lousy husband,
and shag.

-Hey.

Put your glad rags on,
we're going out for dinner.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.761
Ugh, you're always doing this.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.030
I'm tired, in my pajamas,
I'm not going out.

24:26.032 --> 24:29.066
Okay, I just got some good news
I wanted us to celebrate.

24:29.068 --> 24:32.603
What, someone's upgraded you to
the idiot in the village?

24:32.605 --> 24:35.005
-What?
-Nothing, sweetheart.
What's your news?

24:35.007 --> 24:38.642
Well, looks like
I've come into some money.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.677
What?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.080
Amazing, how much?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.215
20.

24:44.217 --> 24:47.985
20 million, fuck! [chuckles]

24:47.987 --> 24:48.986
No! [chuckles]

24:51.057 --> 24:52.156
20 grand!

24:53.559 --> 24:55.693
My uncle died. It's brilliant.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.495
Oh, congrats.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.997
Yeah. 20 million!
[sarcastic chuckle]

24:59.999 --> 25:01.632
No, no, ha!

25:01.634 --> 25:03.167
[sarcastic chuckle]
What a random number.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.070
I don't know. I don-- uh?

25:06.072 --> 25:08.272
That's so strange
that you would just pick

25:08.274 --> 25:10.975
20 million out of anywhere.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.077
What? I don't know,
I was going to--

25:13.079 --> 25:15.746
And then you said and um,
I got carried away and--

25:15.748 --> 25:17.548
-But that's still so weird.
-So weird.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.750
It just goes
straight from err to that.

-[Mark sarcastically chuckles]
-Honey--

25:21.220 --> 25:23.621
Listen, what I've decided is,

25:23.623 --> 25:25.723
I'm going to spend it all
on the wedding.

25:25.725 --> 25:26.957
Because you, my love,

25:27.860 --> 25:29.193
you deserve the best.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.683
So sweet.

25:35.684 --> 25:37.801
-20 million! [chuckles] Idiot.
-[chuckles]

25:47.146 --> 25:50.014
Did you reserve the table?

25:50.016 --> 25:51.582
No, but I think
we'll be all right.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.721
Is there a good reason
we didn't get a cab?

25:59.559 --> 26:01.959
Well, yeah, I thought you'd
appreciate the exercise.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.863
Those jeans were a bit tight.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.634
Yeah, I hope you'll like it.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.269
Uh, it's one of my favorite
places in town.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.204
I'm sure, but--

26:14.206 --> 26:15.739
You all right?

26:15.741 --> 26:17.074
Can I get two large donnas,

26:17.076 --> 26:18.876
extra chili,
extra garlic, please?

26:19.712 --> 26:22.613
And uh, do you want--
d'you want a coke?

26:22.615 --> 26:24.315
Hey, two cokes.

26:24.317 --> 26:25.916
You're kidding?

26:25.918 --> 26:26.884
There you go.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.753
That'll be Â£9.50.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.955
Okay, hold on.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.958
Bollocks,
I've left my wallet at home.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.359
Can you lend me a tenner?

26:35.361 --> 26:36.760
Seriously?

26:38.097 --> 26:39.997
Don't embarrass me
in front of kebab man.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.101
She's got it, it's all right.

26:47.206 --> 26:50.874
Oh, 20! Keep the change.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.845
Ah, you're right,
I should have booked.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.180
Look, it's full up.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.385
This is a really good
kebab shop.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.987
Do you seriously expect me
to sit here,

27:02.989 --> 27:05.356
and eat this on the street
like a cockroach?

27:05.358 --> 27:07.224
A cockroach?
That's a bit much, isn't it?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.126
Look at this. Thank you.

27:09.128 --> 27:13.197
I have been
looking forward to this all day.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.798
Extra garlicky.

27:18.671 --> 27:19.870
Oh!

27:21.741 --> 27:22.906
Uh, it's all right.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.310
What's wrong,
you don't like kebabs?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.412
Wearing them, no!

27:28.414 --> 27:32.883
Eating them-- Yes!

27:32.885 --> 27:35.252
We should do this again
sometime. This is fun.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.689
-I would like to go home.
-Yeah, okay.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.858
Oh, but I haven't thanked you
for this, come here.

27:44.830 --> 27:45.829
Such a lucky man.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.965
I know. [chuckles]

27:52.071 --> 27:54.204
[Mark] Come on,
it's gonna get cold.

28:03.949 --> 28:05.449
Morning.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.717
Morning.

28:10.423 --> 28:11.922
[Mark] Ahh.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.995
[radio playing music]

28:24.837 --> 28:26.904
Morning, eat that. [laughs]

28:30.076 --> 28:31.842
We meant to be
doing something today?

28:31.844 --> 28:33.844
Uh, yeah,
getting my wedding dress.

28:33.846 --> 28:34.912
Uhuh!

28:34.914 --> 28:36.280
Aw, I don't want to do that,

28:36.282 --> 28:37.815
that doesn't sound like
any fun to me.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.416
Baby, it's not
about you having fun,

28:39.418 --> 28:42.953
it's about you being there
to support me.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.788
-Uhuh.
-And pay for the dress.

28:45.891 --> 28:50.127
Of course, sweetheart,
I have you covered.

28:51.797 --> 28:54.064
What's that? Half a shoe?

28:56.402 --> 28:58.068
[whispers]
Are trying to be funny again?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.036
Nope.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.473
Baby, please don't make me
regret saying yes.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.374
I don't do cheap.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.777
Well, if you're having second
thoughts about the wedding?

29:06.779 --> 29:08.212
Of course, not. [laughs]

29:08.214 --> 29:11.949
It's our special day
and as your princess

29:11.951 --> 29:14.918
I'm going to make sure
I look like one.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.755
So, that means
the cheapest dress

29:17.757 --> 29:19.022
probably isn't the nicest.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.825
Yes, but superstition.

29:21.827 --> 29:22.893
Super special.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.496
Super special, okay.

29:25.498 --> 29:26.530
Is that my coffee?

29:26.532 --> 29:28.098
Oh, d'you want one?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.838
It's empty.

29:34.840 --> 29:38.442
Last one, sorry.
It was nice though.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.114
[Mark] Why don't you want
Kendra at the wedding?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.949
[Connie] We don't talk anymore.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.017
You fall out?

29:47.853 --> 29:49.486
Can we stop
talking about Kendra.

29:54.927 --> 29:55.959
What do you think?

29:55.961 --> 30:03.400
-Yeah. I like it. [laughs]
-[laughs] Yeah.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.335
Just... [laughs]

30:05.337 --> 30:10.407
It reminds me of that, but like
in a good way, obviously.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.843
I'll try another one on.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.012
You sure? I like it.

30:15.014 --> 30:15.979
Yeah.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.982
[phone ringing].

30:18.984 --> 30:21.285
Tim, oh thank god,
I'm so fucking bored.

30:22.221 --> 30:24.221
No, I'm not doing
anything important.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.456
[pop music playing]

30:41.941 --> 30:45.375
-Slutty.
-No!

30:45.377 --> 30:48.378
[pop song playing]

30:49.515 --> 30:51.949
[laughs]

31:04.163 --> 31:06.997
Do you approve of this one?

31:06.999 --> 31:08.899
I mean, yeah, they're all fine.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.034
You've had a shitty comment
for every dress I've tried on.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.337
I like this one,
so I'm just waiting

31:13.339 --> 31:15.572
for the possible fault
you're going to find with it.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.176
Look, if I have to find a fault,

31:19.178 --> 31:22.279
I mean, if you're going to
put a gun against my head,

31:22.281 --> 31:23.513
makes you look like a man.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.115
A man?

31:25.117 --> 31:28.352
No, sorry. Not a man,
like a drag queen,

31:28.354 --> 31:31.255
but like a really bang-able one.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.924
Well, feel free to find a dress

31:33.926 --> 31:36.026
that doesn't
make me look like RuPaul

31:36.028 --> 31:39.396
or a pregnant whale,
or a French prostitute.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.899
Because I would like
to find a dress

31:41.901 --> 31:43.367
that doesn't make you laugh

31:43.369 --> 31:45.469
or make me feel
like a circus act.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.071
I mean, there must be one, so--

31:48.073 --> 31:49.072
Which one?

31:50.509 --> 31:51.475
That one.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.612
[Mark] That one,
that one, that one.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.115
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.616
Next, next, next, next--

31:59.618 --> 32:01.652
Ah, ah, ah, don't skip it.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.954
Ah, ah, one back.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.356
That's the bunny.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.993
Thi-- This one?

32:09.995 --> 32:11.528
Yes.

32:11.530 --> 32:15.365
Sir, this one's actually
a child's bridesmaids dress.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.000
It's a joke,
it's a bridesmaid's dress.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.201
Well, they'll let it out.

32:18.203 --> 32:20.270
It's green.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.239
Who wants to be
like all the other brides?

32:22.241 --> 32:23.640
You'll stand out.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.376
You'll be-- you'll be my
pea green princess.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.245
Well, you gonna
be my pea green groom?

32:28.247 --> 32:29.479
-No. [chuckles]
-No!

32:29.481 --> 32:31.014
I'm not stupid. [laughs]

32:32.418 --> 32:33.583
Go ahead, try it on.

32:44.363 --> 32:47.264
Oh yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, that.

32:47.266 --> 32:52.302
No, it doesn't even fit me.
It's a children's dress,
for children.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.004
Here standeth before me

32:54.006 --> 32:57.107
an angel in green. An angel.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.076
[sighs]

33:08.120 --> 33:10.520
Oh my god, it's beautiful.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.656
It's so green, I love it.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.157
That's the dress. That's it.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.026
I want to marry you
in that dress.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.428
Ladies, thank you very much.
We'll wrap it up, we'll take it.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.602
There you go, gentlemen.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.242
This is so much harder
than I thought it would be.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.377
What, being a dick?

33:33.379 --> 33:36.113
Hmm, it's harder than you think.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.015
Well, why don't you
just call it quits?

33:38.017 --> 33:40.584
My rent's due in a week.
I can move straight back in.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.053
Let's go home now and start
throwin' her stuff out.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.621
I am not throwing
in the towel, Timmy.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.124
I have to believe even if it's
microscopic in size,

33:47.126 --> 33:48.358
that she has some dignity left.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.060
She's got to be about to crack.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.630
Isn't that,
that twat from the funeral?

33:53.632 --> 33:55.799
Yeah, let's
talk about this later.

33:55.801 --> 33:56.800
Hello, gorgeous.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.036
Johnny, Tim. Tim, Johnny.

33:59.038 --> 34:02.139
Yeah, we met at the funeral,
remember? Uh, chinless.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.173
Lovely to see
you again, Timothy.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.708
Whatever.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.476
[phone ringing]

34:06.478 --> 34:09.146
Uh, sugar tits, can I get a pint
for my guys over here.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.581
He's fucking JS.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.784
He's the bloke who's been
talking to Connie.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.752
Well, you're gonna definitely
have to raise your game

34:15.754 --> 34:18.155
if you want to be as
obnoxious as this prick.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.123
Listen, do you know
who you're talking to?

34:20.125 --> 34:21.658
Do you know who
you're talking to?
Johnathan Sothcott.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.560
Do you know
who I'm fucking talking to?

34:23.562 --> 34:24.795
It's the dickless fuckface,
that fucking isn't having you.

34:24.797 --> 34:26.630
Now go fuck yourself.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.765
Ugh, fucking charities.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.069
Mate, if I wanted head,
I'd have asked
for a fucking blowjob.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.773
You, pint, sort it out.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.076
-Sorry, I do apologize, sir.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:41.113 --> 34:43.547
[Johnny laughs]

34:44.817 --> 34:46.283
-Wonderful.
-[bartender] Aye.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.454
Just stop.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.195
Thanks. Hey.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.230
Kendra, hi, hi.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.498
-Oh god.
-Uh--

35:04.870 --> 35:06.870
Avoided an awkward
situation there, didn't we?

35:06.872 --> 35:08.138
Did we?

35:08.140 --> 35:09.573
Maybe that can be our thing.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.441
Listen, whatever Connie wants
you to say to me

35:11.443 --> 35:12.742
-I don't know
why she didn't just--
-No, she didn't.

35:12.744 --> 35:13.677
Connie didn't send me
to say anything.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.378
No, this is for me.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.714
Okay, what do you want?

35:17.716 --> 35:19.850
-Grab a coffee?
-Yes, sorry, Mark. Thanks.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.789
And so yeah,
for whatever reason,

35:25.791 --> 35:28.492
she and Johnny
think I'm about to become rich,

35:28.494 --> 35:30.760
and so they're just-- Thank you.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.762
-That's fine.
-They're just using me.

35:32.764 --> 35:33.897
Classic Connie.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.600
Yeah, that's my sad sorry tale.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.269
Why did you two fall out?

35:39.271 --> 35:41.238
Once upon a time, I was engaged

35:41.240 --> 35:43.807
and she slept with my fiancÃ©.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.375
Oh.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.310
No happy ending then.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.146
I caught them
at Tommy's funeral.

35:49.148 --> 35:52.349
He was consoling her in
a back room, my back room.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.318
I mean anal. My maid of honor!

35:55.320 --> 35:56.553
How her clichÃ©d is that?

35:56.555 --> 35:57.921
Anal.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.356
Maybe I should take a leaf
out of your book

35:59.358 --> 36:01.158
and get revenge on him.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.727
Well, I have a list of things
I was planning to do.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.195
-Uhuh.
-Happy to share.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.497
-Great.
-Fucking anal.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.666
Uh, you could create
a fake email

36:09.668 --> 36:11.535
and send his boss dick pics.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.670
You drop eye drops in his drink,
you could fake a pregnancy.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.205
Oh my god,
do you know what I could do?

36:15.207 --> 36:16.640
What?

36:16.642 --> 36:18.341
A letter arrived
from the Modern School of Art

36:18.343 --> 36:19.409
inviting him to apply.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.477
It's his dream opportunity,

36:20.479 --> 36:22.779
it's all he's ever talked about.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.514
He doesn't know
the letter's arrived.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.316
Rip it up.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.918
It's a bit of a shit thing to
do, though, isn't it?

36:27.920 --> 36:31.521
Aw, cheating on you with
your best friend isn't?

36:31.523 --> 36:33.290
-Fuck him.
-Fuck him.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.292
How far
are you going to take this?

36:35.294 --> 36:37.794
[sighs] Take it
as far as it needs to go.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.498
It's weird though,
she strangely thick skinned.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.466
She seems to be
taking it all in a stride.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.302
-Bitchy.
-You know what it is?

36:45.304 --> 36:46.736
I think I'm too charming.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.438
I just seem to fail
to repel her.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.842
No? No, okay, it's not that.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.844
She hates someone
being center of attention.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.647
Will you help me with something?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.649
What little something?

36:59.651 --> 37:00.817
Are you free tonight?

37:02.321 --> 37:04.955
What makes you think
I need to go on a blind date?

37:04.957 --> 37:06.523
Because you sit around
your flat wearing nothing

37:06.525 --> 37:08.225
but your pants
watching porn all day.

37:08.227 --> 37:12.362
Uh, not true, actually.
I'm on my PlayStation.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.330
Sorry, I didn't realize you were

37:13.332 --> 37:15.265
such a social butterfly.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.933
Are you wearing any trousers?

37:17.803 --> 37:19.636
Yes, I'll give you that one.

37:19.638 --> 37:23.907
Ducky, want to go on a date?
[speaking Ducky] Yeah.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.978
I think it's great
that he finally has a date.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.280
Yes, are you sure
they're going to let Tim in?

37:30.282 --> 37:32.949
Uh, come on, Connie,
can you just not be mean.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.718
We're meant to make him look
good in front of his girlfriend.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.754
Yeah, I'm assuming
she's blind or needs a visa.

37:37.756 --> 37:41.758
And here they are!
Hi. Hey, come in.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.960
[both sides gasp]

37:43.962 --> 37:45.562
Oh my god.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.765
Mark, Connie, meet Kendra.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.699
Wow!

37:50.535 --> 37:52.402
Connie, look, it's Kendra.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.770
Yes, I can see.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.740
Mark, Kendra,
do you know each other?

37:56.742 --> 38:00.543
Yes, we do, Tim.
We all went to school together.

38:00.545 --> 38:01.878
What a small world.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.447
-Connie.
-Kendra, how are you?

38:04.449 --> 38:05.849
Yeah, good, thanks, Con.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.550
Hey, congratulations
on your engagement.

38:07.552 --> 38:11.521
He's quite the steal.
Oh, calamari.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.993
So, how did you two meet?

38:18.897 --> 38:19.863
In--

38:21.633 --> 38:24.501
-I don't mean to pry. [chuckles]
-Yes. [sarcastic laugh]

38:26.805 --> 38:29.039
I have to say, Kendra that dress
looks marvelous on you.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.774
Well, thanks, that's so sweet.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.710
No, not at all.
Tim, you are a lucky man.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.914
What? Since when did you
become a fashion expert?

38:41.053 --> 38:43.486
You've never complimented me
on anything I've ever worn.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.456
Or maybe if you went shopping
with Kendra, I would.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.991
[Kendra] I'd love
to take you shopping.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.060
I'm sure we could sort that out.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.998
Oh my god,
speaking of embarrassing things,

38:55.000 --> 38:56.766
do you remember history lessons,

38:56.768 --> 38:59.035
or awkward bonus sessions as
you used to call them?

38:59.037 --> 39:01.004
God, yes, how could I forget?

39:01.006 --> 39:04.674
It was like clockwork. Never
knew I liked history so much.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.009
He had to sit at
the back of the class.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.344
Yes, I was always afraid.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.478
They make me go to the front

39:08.480 --> 39:09.412
and then I'd tip the table over

39:09.414 --> 39:10.980
on my way up! [laughter]

39:10.982 --> 39:12.349
You're telling me,
we had to put a block

39:12.351 --> 39:13.350
on the History Channel.

39:13.352 --> 39:14.984
[laughter]

39:14.986 --> 39:16.686
Tim, you're hilarious.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.623
Kendra, and do you remember
the time when Mr. Thomas

39:20.625 --> 39:25.028
passed out outside
the dining hall? [laughs]

39:29.935 --> 39:31.901
He had a very
serious condition, Connie.

39:33.105 --> 39:34.704
A bit awkward.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.806
-What was it he had?
-Narcolepsy.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.748
Um, didn't he end up
getting buried alive.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.416
[laughter]

39:46.418 --> 39:48.051
[Mark] That was a good one!

39:49.020 --> 39:50.687
It wasn't funny.

39:50.689 --> 39:55.658
Friends, ahh, narcolepsy.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.694
None of you is funny.

39:57.696 --> 40:03.099
I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love,
and she loves me back.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.768
Tim, you get paid to say that.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.669
She probably said
you were the best she ever had

40:06.671 --> 40:08.571
and that Tiny Tim was huge.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.774
Ha, ha, you can joke
all you want, Mark

40:10.776 --> 40:14.644
it doesn't matter,
because I'm in love.

40:14.646 --> 40:16.479
I'm in love with Kendra.

40:17.616 --> 40:18.748
With Kendra?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.850
Yes, a million times, yes!

40:22.154 --> 40:24.521
Mate, why don't you sit down

40:24.523 --> 40:27.991
because I think maybe you've
missed the entire point
of last night.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.026
All right.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.197
[mandolin music]

40:34.199 --> 40:37.133
Ooo, I better get this.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.636
-Here you go, sugar tits.
-Thank you.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.140
Ahh, right.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.776
Could you please
put some clothes on?

40:46.778 --> 40:48.745
Could you please take some off?

40:48.747 --> 40:51.047
Oh god, it was so awkward.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.650
What the fuck
was she doing there?

40:53.652 --> 40:55.151
And to add salt to the wound,

40:55.153 --> 40:58.721
I had to sit there
fake smiling as usual. Ugh.

40:58.723 --> 41:02.225
I've got lockjaw
on a daily basis now, ugh.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.893
What, from giving him
loads of blowjobs?

41:05.230 --> 41:07.063
No. Oh god,

41:07.065 --> 41:10.066
if I fake any more, I'm going to
get a brain hemorrhage.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.802
[yawning and mumbling]

41:12.804 --> 41:15.772
I'm sorry, am I--
Am I boring you?

41:17.075 --> 41:18.975
Ugh, ah.

41:21.046 --> 41:24.747
I'm good, sugar tits.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.883
What you're
doing is great, right?

41:26.885 --> 41:31.488
I'm really proud of
how far you've come.
Just [inhales] breathe.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.056
-Uhuh.
-It's all
in the fucking mind now,

41:33.058 --> 41:34.691
yeah?
You've got to stay focused.

41:34.693 --> 41:35.825
Uhuh.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.093
-Yes?
-Yes.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.863
Think of what we
can do with it, yes?

41:39.865 --> 41:40.864
Yes, I can buy therapy.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.735
Great chat.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.639
Ugh.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.644
-You used me.
-I thought you knew
what we were doing.

41:54.646 --> 41:56.546
-How could you do that to me?
-Because, Tim,

41:56.548 --> 41:58.248
-I thought you knew
what we were doing.
-Why?

41:58.250 --> 42:00.917
Because I don't have feelings?
Because I don't have needs?

42:00.919 --> 42:04.153
-Oh, for god's sake.
-Oh, good old Tim,
we'll use him.

42:04.155 --> 42:08.124
All he does is sit around
and watch porn all day.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.093
An' uh, he won't mind.

42:10.095 --> 42:13.763
He's probably spanking
one out right now as we speak.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.733
-Were you?
-Yes.

42:16.735 --> 42:19.002
-Well.
-That's beside the point.

42:19.004 --> 42:22.839
You assumed that I was
too insensitive to care.

42:22.841 --> 42:25.108
Prick me, Mark. Do I not bleed?

42:25.110 --> 42:28.711
Tim, I remember telling you
the actual words

42:28.713 --> 42:30.613
that it was a fake date.

42:30.615 --> 42:35.585
Congratulations, Mark
because I do care. I do bleed.

Are you blind
or are you just a fucking moron?

43:27.105 --> 43:29.072
I like it. I think it suits you.

You're a moron.

I'm not the one who put
hair removal cream
in my shampoo, am I?

43:35.347 --> 43:37.113
What the hell
was hair removal cream

43:37.115 --> 43:38.815
doing in there
in the first place?

43:38.817 --> 43:40.683

me to have a hairy back?

you'll have sobbed out

all your boohooing by then?

43:49.794 --> 43:51.127
[Connie crying]

43:51.129 --> 43:53.963
No? Okay.
Then maybe you have a big hat?

43:53.965 --> 43:55.398
No, I do not have a big hat

go out in public

Okay, well, then I'll uh,

44:01.640 --> 44:03.373
I'll cancel the car
and the holiday then.

44:03.375 --> 44:04.340
Thank you.

and postpone the wedding too.

44:11.182 --> 44:12.849
Well, if you can't
go out in public

44:12.851 --> 44:13.850
I assume you have to wait
till your hair grows back

44:13.852 --> 44:14.851
to get married.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.953
So-- think of the photos.

No, it's fine.

[chuckles] It's not bad actually
like, you said, quite good.

Look at all the things
that I can do,

that I couldn't do
when I had too much hair.

44:39.244 --> 44:44.847
-Great, so all good
for the holiday then?
-Yup.

something that might help.

I wore it for a fancy
dress contest. I was Cher.

You know I wasn't wondering.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.696

I came second.

every morning,

you could do to annoy me?

the same question.

50:39.470 --> 50:41.037
What do you mean by that?

50:42.240 --> 50:44.273
You clearly don't love Mark.

50:44.275 --> 50:47.243
-Huh, of course I do.
-Really?

50:47.245 --> 50:48.811
Well, then name something
you even like about him

50:48.813 --> 50:50.046
because you clearly
don't struggle

50:50.048 --> 50:50.780
to list the things he does

50:50.782 --> 50:52.114
that piss you off.

50:53.317 --> 50:54.316
I knew this would happen.

50:55.486 --> 50:57.520
Yup, you still blame me.

50:57.522 --> 51:00.156
Of course not.
You were such a good friend.

51:00.158 --> 51:02.324
It's not my fault
you conning on to a boyfriend.

51:02.326 --> 51:04.527
FiancÃ©, and yes it is,
if you're the one who fucks him.

51:07.365 --> 51:10.666
[Tim] Come on now,
I've got your dish.

51:11.669 --> 51:19.075
-[Ducky growls]
-I have it. Oh, beans?

51:19.077 --> 51:21.644
-Not really a big fan.
-Right.

51:22.647 --> 51:24.380
In the damn supermarket, anyone?

51:24.382 --> 51:25.548
Knock yourself out.

51:25.550 --> 51:27.249
-I'll come.
-Right.

51:30.288 --> 51:33.522
You know what?
I saw a lovely pub nearby.

51:35.159 --> 51:40.262
Spork. It's not yours Ducky!

51:41.132 --> 51:43.265
-Are we taking this too far?
-No.

51:45.269 --> 51:47.603
Was it honestly an accident
leaving Connie behind?

51:47.605 --> 51:48.704
Yes.

51:48.706 --> 51:50.272
You sure it hasn't just become

51:50.274 --> 51:51.674
second nature to be mean to her?

51:52.777 --> 51:54.543
Most people
would've moved on by now.

51:54.545 --> 51:57.279
Really?
You moved on from your fiancÃ©?

51:59.317 --> 52:00.382
No.

52:02.587 --> 52:03.719
Thanks.

52:05.156 --> 52:07.523
Rip up the letter.
You'll feel better.

52:07.525 --> 52:09.625
I don't think
revenge is the answer

52:09.627 --> 52:11.193
and I don't think you do either.

52:11.195 --> 52:13.195
Well, that's working for me.

52:22.607 --> 52:23.739
-Here, go on.
-No.

52:23.741 --> 52:24.807
Let's destroy the evidence.

52:26.544 --> 52:28.744
-[phone camera click]
-What are you doing?

52:28.746 --> 52:30.813
What I should've done
from the start.

52:32.216 --> 52:34.817
I'm sending it to him.

52:40.158 --> 52:42.191
Maybe Connie deserves this,

52:42.193 --> 52:45.661
but are we any better
by being so dishonest
and manipulative?

52:47.365 --> 52:48.898
Getting your dignity back
has got be worth something,

52:48.900 --> 52:50.232
isn't it?

52:50.234 --> 52:51.567
Yeah, but I'd like to point out

52:51.569 --> 52:52.801
there is a big difference

52:52.803 --> 52:53.736
between getting
your dignity back

52:53.738 --> 52:55.437
and getting revenge.

52:55.439 --> 52:57.206
Maybe it's just time
that on behalf of all men,

52:57.208 --> 52:59.208
that have been duped by some
scurrilous gold-digger

52:59.210 --> 53:00.676
that I get a little payback.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.746
Bollocks. Don't play the victim.

53:03.748 --> 53:06.415
Don't pretend
this is some grand crusade.

53:06.417 --> 53:08.551
This is about your fragile ego.

53:08.553 --> 53:11.520
-Ooh?
-Here's the thing
I don't understand, Mark.

53:11.522 --> 53:15.357
Connie is already
a fundamentally
unhappy person, right?

53:15.359 --> 53:17.927
So, why are you wasting
so much of your time

53:17.929 --> 53:20.329
and energy on trying to
make her even more miserable?

53:20.331 --> 53:22.231
There's no prize
at the end of this.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.202
And I don't think she's the only
one who's being punished.

53:28.506 --> 53:29.572
I'll settle the bill.

53:30.775 --> 53:33.242
[background music]

53:33.244 --> 53:34.210
[cellphone pings a text]

53:50.795 --> 53:53.829
[snoring]

54:04.408 --> 54:09.445
Oh my god, oh my god.
[cough, cough]
Oh my god.

54:17.888 --> 54:19.722
Come here, you little shit bag.

54:19.724 --> 54:21.323
Connie, can I have a word?

54:21.325 --> 54:22.658
[Connie] Come here.
No, leave me alone.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.361
Come on. Give it to me,
stupid dog.

54:25.363 --> 54:26.729
[growling]

54:26.731 --> 54:28.397
-[Mark] Connie.
-Mark, leave me alone!

54:28.399 --> 54:31.300
Leave me alone. No, get off.
No, no, no, no.

54:31.302 --> 54:32.935
-Connie.
-What? What?

54:32.937 --> 54:33.902
I just want to have a chat.

54:33.904 --> 54:35.604
Oh, you want to chat?

54:35.606 --> 54:37.940
What do you want
to chat about Mark?

54:37.942 --> 54:41.877
What nugget of brilliance
have you got for me today?

54:41.879 --> 54:44.580
Have you got another
fucking surprise up your sleeve?

54:44.582 --> 54:46.582
Are we going to the sauna
with your fat friend or maybe,

54:46.584 --> 54:48.717
I'm going to go winkle picking
with Kendra, will that be fun?

54:50.855 --> 54:52.638
That wouldn't be awkward,
would it?

54:52.639 --> 54:54.422
Tell me, Mark.
I'm waiting on tenterhooks.

54:54.425 --> 54:56.992
I'm waiting with bated breath

54:56.994 --> 55:01.563
to hear what earth shattering
chat we're going to have.

55:03.467 --> 55:07.369
-Don't leave me
in the dark, Mark. Tell me.
-Nothing, Connie.

55:07.371 --> 55:10.639
-Oh, good. So can we go home?
-No, not yet.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.941
Of course. We're going to stay
another night

55:12.943 --> 55:16.745
-in this luxury five-star field.
-Nope.

55:16.747 --> 55:19.014
-Well, what then?
-We're gonna, um--

55:19.016 --> 55:23.552
Oh, no, I'm gonna stop you right
there. I don't want to
ruin the surprise,

55:23.554 --> 55:26.355
'cause you know how much
I fucking love them so far.

55:26.357 --> 55:28.557
Yeah well, you know what?
You'll probably hate it like
everything else, wouldn't you?

55:28.559 --> 55:31.894
-Ugh. Where's the bathroom?
-Oh, it's over there next

55:31.896 --> 55:34.730
-to the five-star restaurant.
-What restaurant?

55:34.732 --> 55:37.366
Oh, that's right. We're in a
field. Go behind the bushes.

55:37.368 --> 55:38.867
I'm not going behind the bushes.

55:38.869 --> 55:40.002
Go wherever you want, Connie.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.337
Just do it downwind of me.

55:42.473 --> 55:48.043
Fuck you. Fuck you!
You get out as well.

55:50.581 --> 55:55.084
What, a fucking lunch box?
Fucking camping.

55:55.086 --> 55:57.419
Who's fucking
shit idea was that?

55:57.421 --> 56:01.457
Could you help tidy up?
Fucking done with camping.

56:01.459 --> 56:03.992
Fucking done with it.
Never again, never.

56:03.994 --> 56:05.794
[music]

56:09.500 --> 56:16.739
Connie! Connie! Connie,
you asleep? Connie.

56:16.741 --> 56:17.906
[Connie] What? Shut up.

56:17.908 --> 56:19.141
-Are you asleep?
-Yes.

56:19.143 --> 56:20.642
I was just checking.

56:25.750 --> 56:27.049
-[thud]
-Aaah!

56:50.608 --> 56:51.607
We're here.

56:51.609 --> 56:56.812
Kitten. Why do you
do this to yourself?

56:56.814 --> 56:58.547
We'll have to get
Alexa to sort you out.

56:58.549 --> 57:00.115
If you insist
on looking like a drag queen.

57:00.117 --> 57:02.551
Couldn't you at least
look like a pretty one?

57:02.553 --> 57:04.586
Oh, my god. Mom.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.822
I thought she said her parents
died in a house fire.

57:06.824 --> 57:10.426
-Pumpkin!
-Hi, ha, ha.

57:11.862 --> 57:12.861
[kissing] You look awful.

57:12.863 --> 57:14.096
Oh, god.

57:14.098 --> 57:15.798
Surprise.

57:15.800 --> 57:18.467
Well, hello, Mr. Beefcake.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.536
Let's get you
out of these wet things.

57:20.538 --> 57:21.537
They're not wet.

57:21.539 --> 57:23.806
Oh, must just be me then.

57:26.777 --> 57:27.810
I'm out of here.

57:27.812 --> 57:29.711
No. Tim. I need you.

57:29.713 --> 57:32.080
Come on, puppy.
We're going home.

57:32.082 --> 57:33.715
Unlock the car.

57:33.717 --> 57:34.883
Welcome, welcome.

57:34.885 --> 57:39.121
-See you inside.
Come on, trust me.
-But you--

57:39.990 --> 57:43.025
So, you're the lucky chap
marrying my daughter, then?

57:43.027 --> 57:44.726
-No, afraid not. Best man.
-Oh, best man?

57:44.728 --> 57:47.563
-Yes.
-Are you a rugby player?

57:54.839 --> 57:56.972
Don't take one. We don't want
to have to squeeze you

57:56.974 --> 57:58.207
into your wedding dress.

57:58.209 --> 57:59.575
Or, indeed the church.

57:59.577 --> 58:03.946
How are you, Alexa?
You look like you've
had a few late nights.

58:03.948 --> 58:05.747
Hmph, what a chief?

58:07.551 --> 58:08.984
Sorry, what?

58:08.986 --> 58:10.752
I think it's a goth thing.

58:10.754 --> 58:12.187
Chief.

58:12.189 --> 58:13.922
Thank you.

58:13.924 --> 58:15.891
Very kind of you
to put us all up, Carol.

58:15.893 --> 58:18.594
Mm, my pleasure.

58:18.596 --> 58:21.497
Connie doesn't have
that many friends over here.

58:21.499 --> 58:24.500
Yeah, I wonder why.

58:25.202 --> 58:26.835
Oh no, she's talking
to herself again.

58:26.837 --> 58:27.903
I hope
that doesn't mean we have to

58:27.905 --> 58:29.771
send her back to the clinic.

58:29.773 --> 58:32.074
Well, I'm not paying for it,
and she's your problem now.

58:34.578 --> 58:36.178
-[giggles]
-Do you want some bread, Chief?

58:36.180 --> 58:37.813
Dad, will you say something?

58:37.815 --> 58:40.282
Alexa, don't waste food
on Connie.

58:41.285 --> 58:42.951
You know I recognize you.

58:42.953 --> 58:44.953
I'm one
of Connie's oldest friends.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.890
She used to come here every day.

58:47.892 --> 58:49.791
Oh yeah,

58:49.793 --> 58:51.260
the sexy one.

58:51.262 --> 58:52.561
Oh, god.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.296
They used to be best friends.

58:54.298 --> 58:56.932
Best friends,
you mean only friend?

58:56.934 --> 58:59.568
Until Connie
fucked Kendra's fiancÃ©.

58:59.570 --> 59:01.703
-Alexa!
-Pork chop.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.238
-You bitch.
-Language.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.207
-Chief.
-Well, I must say,

59:05.209 --> 59:06.909
that doesn't sound
very sporting, pumpkin.

59:06.911 --> 59:08.544
I hope you apologized.

59:08.546 --> 59:09.978
No, daddy.

59:09.980 --> 59:11.780
-Gabby.
-Yes, sir.

59:11.782 --> 59:15.017
More bread.
Not for Connie though.

59:15.019 --> 59:18.120
And uh, Gabby, fill this up,
would you?

59:22.560 --> 59:24.693
-[slap]
-Oh, there's a good girl.

59:30.834 --> 59:34.336
[Patrick] So, you're going to
make an honest woman
of my daughter, then.

59:34.338 --> 59:36.271
I'm expected to
give my blessing.

59:36.273 --> 59:38.807
I need to know that you're
going to make her happy, Mark.

59:38.809 --> 59:42.110
What's the point,
if you're not going
to make each other happy?

59:42.112 --> 59:44.079
It's a kind of embarrassing,
but um,

59:44.081 --> 59:45.581
I spent most of my childhood

59:45.583 --> 59:46.915
daydreaming about
my life with Connie.

59:48.786 --> 59:52.621
You're right.
That was embarrassing.

59:52.623 --> 59:54.156
No, no, no. That's really sweet.

59:54.158 --> 59:57.693
Connie is so lucky
to have met someone like you.

59:57.695 --> 59:59.294
-Yes, very lucky.
-Very lucky.

59:59.296 --> 1:00:00.762
Very, very, lucky.

1:00:00.764 --> 1:00:02.331
-Really lucky.
-Very lucky.

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:05.200
-Yes, very, very, very lucky.
-Chief.

1:00:05.202 --> 1:00:08.203
Yeah, I'm a firm believer
in traditional standards.

1:00:09.139 --> 1:00:11.273
Woman's place
is in the home and whatnot,

1:00:11.275 --> 1:00:13.842
or in the kitchen
if you can't afford a maid.

1:00:13.844 --> 1:00:15.677
That's very progressive of you.

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:20.015
Hmm.
Can you afford a maid, Mark?

1:00:20.017 --> 1:00:22.150
I am working on it.

1:00:22.152 --> 1:00:27.956
See, I want Connie to be
independent, not so reliant
on mom and dad.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.224
Yes, daddy.

1:00:29.226 --> 1:00:31.259
That's why we spent
her inheritance,

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:34.363
on Alexa's promising pop career.

1:00:35.833 --> 1:00:38.000
<i> Â¶ Chief fuck Â¶</i>

1:00:40.204 --> 1:00:44.673
Now, I know that some people
may see me as a bit uh,
old fashioned, that's fine.

1:00:44.675 --> 1:00:50.045
The world goes on.
But there are certain things
that I simply will not accept.

1:00:50.047 --> 1:00:53.281
-[Mark] No, of course not.
-[Patrick] I mean,
don't get me wrong.

1:00:53.283 --> 1:00:56.418
I know that when you're young
things can seem very confusing.

1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:58.053
I myself had crushes

1:00:58.055 --> 1:01:01.990
on some of the bigger boys
at my school.

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:03.759
Oh, good Lord.

1:01:03.761 --> 1:01:05.827
Captain of the football team
and so forth.

1:01:07.264 --> 1:01:11.166
Harnessing and some fumbling's
heavy petting, gobbling.

1:01:12.036 --> 1:01:17.873
That sort of thing,
but the point is one grows out
of that type of behavior.

1:01:18.809 --> 1:01:20.142
I suppose so.

1:01:21.412 --> 1:01:22.377
More wine?

1:01:24.748 --> 1:01:27.249
I'm going to pace myself,
if that's okay.

1:01:27.251 --> 1:01:29.184
Hmm, suit yourself.

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:32.020
Gabby, top up, please.

1:01:38.062 --> 1:01:40.195
[pidgeon coos]

1:01:43.867 --> 1:01:45.434
My god, let's get out of here.

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:47.069
I couldn't fathom
what he might do next.

1:01:47.071 --> 1:01:48.970
Yeah, minging isn't it?

1:01:48.972 --> 1:01:50.338
Yes, it's awful.

1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:51.740
Almost makes me feel
sorry for her.

1:01:51.742 --> 1:01:53.141
-Hmm.
-Explains a lot.

1:01:53.143 --> 1:01:54.342
Yeah, it does.

1:01:55.379 --> 1:01:57.012
If I didn't know any better,

1:01:57.014 --> 1:01:58.346
and say what you said
about her in there,

1:01:58.348 --> 1:02:00.082
is how you still feel.

1:02:00.084 --> 1:02:01.316
It's a good thing you know
me better then, isn't it?

1:02:01.318 --> 1:02:02.284
Yeah, it is.

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:05.253
You do still have
feelings for her?

1:02:05.255 --> 1:02:07.222
-How silly.
-Yeah, you do.

1:02:07.224 --> 1:02:09.791
This isn't about punishing her
because she deserves it.

1:02:09.793 --> 1:02:11.727
This is about punishing her
so you don't have to let her go.

1:02:11.729 --> 1:02:14.329
No. No, that's not true.

1:02:14.331 --> 1:02:16.798
You've just been validating
your decision to stay with her.

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:17.999
-Really?
-Yes.

1:02:18.001 --> 1:02:22.037
Okay, so what's my alternative?
Alright, I go in there, end it,

1:02:22.039 --> 1:02:25.073
walk off blissfully to the
sunset hand in hand with Tim.
-Yeah.

1:02:25.075 --> 1:02:28.143
Yeah, how's that working out for
you and your ex-fiancÃ©?
Are you happier now?

1:02:28.145 --> 1:02:31.012
I feel like myself again.
I feel like I've moved on.
I'm not angry.

1:02:31.014 --> 1:02:32.748
-I'm not angry!
-Then what are you?

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:39.855
Lonely.
I wish I could end it, I do.

1:02:39.857 --> 1:02:41.823
I wish I could just
walk in there, be done with it.

1:02:44.828 --> 1:02:45.994
I can't. I just--

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:51.900
[sighs] I've been in love
with her for 20 years, Kendra.

1:02:51.902 --> 1:02:54.202
I can't just--
I can't just end it.

1:02:55.372 --> 1:02:57.839
Mark,
you're not in love with her.

1:02:57.841 --> 1:03:00.075
You've been infatuated with her.

1:03:00.077 --> 1:03:02.277
You deserve to be happy.

1:03:02.279 --> 1:03:04.479
You should be with someone
who really understands you

1:03:04.481 --> 1:03:06.848
and appreciates you
and cares about you.

1:03:07.518 --> 1:03:09.284
We both know that's not Connie.

1:03:12.790 --> 1:03:13.555
Oh, come here.

1:03:23.801 --> 1:03:25.433

1:03:29.139 --> 1:03:33.041

[lid slams shut]

1:04:04.308 --> 1:04:05.257
Who is it?

1:04:05.258 --> 1:04:06.207
-I'm coming in.
-Please don't.

1:04:06.210 --> 1:04:07.843
Hello, foxy.

1:04:07.845 --> 1:04:09.477
I think you're
in the wrong room.

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:12.113
No, no, no, no, we can do it
in any room you like.

1:04:12.115 --> 1:04:13.515
I can't fight it any longer.

1:04:13.517 --> 1:04:16.117
Your persistence
has finally paid off.

1:04:16.119 --> 1:04:18.987
You're going to get
a [smack] spanking.

1:04:19.957 --> 1:04:20.922
All right.

1:04:20.924 --> 1:04:23.525
[dramatic music]

1:04:29.099 --> 1:04:30.131
[thunder]

1:04:36.607 --> 1:04:39.441
My safe-word is, Camembert.

1:04:39.443 --> 1:04:42.444
Well, my safe-word is,
your husband terrifies me.

1:04:42.446 --> 1:04:44.112
[dramatic music]

1:04:51.488 --> 1:04:54.923
Don't mind me, old chap.
I'll be as good as gold.

1:04:57.928 --> 1:05:00.228
Ducky, you better
cover your eyes, mate.

1:05:02.065 --> 1:05:04.566
Don't be such a spoilsport.
You'll love it.

1:05:07.271 --> 1:05:10.405
[Tim in the other room] No, no,
no, no, no. Camembert!

1:05:10.407 --> 1:05:14.476
[woman screaming]
One more time. One more time.

1:05:14.478 --> 1:05:15.677
[Tim] Your husband terrifies me!

1:05:21.018 --> 1:05:22.050

Morning, sleep well?

-Ahh.
-[Groans].

1:07:09.393 --> 1:07:11.126
Morning, handsome.

1:07:11.128 --> 1:07:14.529
Timmy? Timmy?

1:07:15.799 --> 1:07:19.667
Timmy? Ahh.

1:07:19.669 --> 1:07:22.771
Anyone seen Beefcake?

1:07:22.773 --> 1:07:25.373
I think I saw
him going for a run.

1:07:27.244 --> 1:07:30.578
Oh, thank you, Kendra. Okay.

1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:32.247
Tim? Timmy?

1:07:34.351 --> 1:07:35.817
[mother] Timmy.

1:07:35.819 --> 1:07:39.154
-[dog barking]
-[mother] Get down, get down.

1:07:39.156 --> 1:07:40.588
She's been bitten by the dog.

1:07:44.461 --> 1:07:46.361
Cons, so how was the road trip?

1:07:46.363 --> 1:07:49.431
Did he get all grabby or did he
keep his mitts to himself?

1:07:49.433 --> 1:07:51.232
Ugh, he's not like that.

1:07:51.234 --> 1:07:53.535
You're confusing him
with yourself.

1:07:53.537 --> 1:07:54.702
[Johnny laughs]

1:07:55.739 --> 1:07:58.339
So, when you speak
to your lawyer next,

1:07:58.341 --> 1:08:00.809
you need to make sure
he gets you some shares too.

1:08:00.811 --> 1:08:04.412
Right, that's where the real
payoff's really going to come
from. Where is the idiot?

1:08:04.414 --> 1:08:07.148
Why d'you have to call him that?
Look, it's still
half of his money.

1:08:07.150 --> 1:08:09.617
There's really no need
to add insult to injury.

1:08:10.587 --> 1:08:14.355
Says the trollop who's literally
about to rip out his heart
and dance on it.

1:08:14.357 --> 1:08:17.392
Literally. I'm literally
going to do that, am I?

1:08:17.394 --> 1:08:20.195
I'm literally going
to open his chest cavity,

1:08:20.197 --> 1:08:24.365
rip out his heart and dance
on it? Any particular dance?

1:08:24.367 --> 1:08:26.568
It can be fucking
Gangnam style if you like it.

1:08:26.570 --> 1:08:28.670
Any girl will be
lucky to have Mark.

1:08:28.672 --> 1:08:30.505
[Johnny]<i> Oh, fucking hell.</i>
<i> Jesus.</i>

1:08:30.507 --> 1:08:33.308
You haven't got that...
Stockholm syndrome, have you?

1:08:33.310 --> 1:08:35.276
-[sighs]
-[Johnny<i> Hang on in there.</i>

1:08:36.179 --> 1:08:39.647
<i> I need you</i>
<i> to sit tight for me, okay?</i>

1:08:39.649 --> 1:08:41.116
We're going to have
so much fucking money.

1:08:41.118 --> 1:08:42.717
So much fucking money.

1:08:42.719 --> 1:08:44.552
Think of all the things
we can do with each other.

1:08:44.554 --> 1:08:47.188
Think of all those lovely,
lovely anal beads I can get you.

1:08:53.897 --> 1:08:57.765
Hey, Siri, call
Fatface McFlippy Nips.

1:08:57.767 --> 1:08:59.767
[Siri]
<i> Calling Fatface McFlippy Nips.</i>

1:08:59.769 --> 1:09:01.236
[phone ringing]

1:09:01.238 --> 1:09:04.472
-Oh, shit it's him.
-Who?

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:07.375
[gagging noises] Him, him!

1:09:07.377 --> 1:09:09.844
The bloke we're talking about.
Fucking Mark.

1:09:09.846 --> 1:09:11.312
Answer it, moron.

1:09:15.352 --> 1:09:17.552
-Hello.
-Johnny, how are you?

1:09:17.554 --> 1:09:19.821
Good, good, good
good, good. What about you?

1:09:19.823 --> 1:09:22.190
Good, just wondering
what you're up to tonight.

1:09:22.192 --> 1:09:24.626
Not a great deal, mate.
No plans as yet.

1:09:24.628 --> 1:09:26.461
Perfect,
why don't you come over here.

1:09:26.463 --> 1:09:27.529
Hmm?

1:09:27.531 --> 1:09:29.197
Bye. Twat.

1:09:36.473 --> 1:09:38.540
I was going out for a bit.

1:09:38.542 --> 1:09:40.375
Okay.

1:09:40.377 --> 1:09:42.677
-Just to the shops.
-Didn't ask.

1:09:44.481 --> 1:09:45.513
Can I get you anything?

1:09:45.515 --> 1:09:47.549
No. I'm fine, thank you.

1:09:50.654 --> 1:09:54.389
Hey, so I just wanted
to apologize for my family.

1:09:58.628 --> 1:10:02.664
-Don't be silly, you've got
nothing to apologize for.
-Yeah, no, I do. [chuckle]

1:10:02.666 --> 1:10:06.534
It's like being around
a bunch of wild animals
on heat at that place.

1:10:06.536 --> 1:10:08.670
We all have our
burdens, don't we?

1:10:08.672 --> 1:10:11.372
You have your family
and I have Tim.

1:10:13.677 --> 1:10:15.210
I wish I could be close to them,

1:10:15.212 --> 1:10:19.614
but, my loss, I guess.
See you later.

1:10:22.219 --> 1:10:23.518
See you later.

1:10:25.722 --> 1:10:27.789
[Mark]<i> Thanks for coming, mate.</i>
<i> It's really nice to see you.</i>

1:10:27.791 --> 1:10:29.490
-[Johnny]<i> Oh, thanks for</i>
<i> inviting me over.</i>
-[door slams]

1:10:29.492 --> 1:10:31.993
Oh, here she is.
Look who's here.

1:10:31.995 --> 1:10:33.695
Ahh, Connie.

1:10:33.697 --> 1:10:34.963
Hey, Johnny.

1:10:34.965 --> 1:10:37.398
-We love you too.
-Hi.

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.334
Uh, sweetheart
we're out of wine,

1:10:39.336 --> 1:10:41.336
so I'm going to nip
to the shop, grab a bottle.

1:10:41.338 --> 1:10:42.870
Uh, you'll be all right
for 10 minutes, will you?

1:10:42.872 --> 1:10:44.305
Yeah, no problem, chief.

1:10:44.307 --> 1:10:45.273
Be back in a bit.

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:53.548
[music]

1:10:53.550 --> 1:10:54.882
What are you doing?

1:10:54.884 --> 1:10:56.618
He's going to be back
in a few minutes.

1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:58.486
Taking my shoes off.
A few minutes is all I need.

1:10:58.488 --> 1:10:59.721
No. No. Stop it. No. No.

1:10:59.723 --> 1:11:02.023
Connie, come on.
It'll be exciting.

1:11:02.025 --> 1:11:03.358
Stop it. Stop it.

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:04.492
Come on.

1:11:04.494 --> 1:11:06.527
Stop it, now. Stop it. Stop it.

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:19.307
They think I'm so stupid.

1:11:19.309 --> 1:11:21.276
Oh, he's got
his trousers off now.

1:11:21.278 --> 1:11:23.611
Come on. Already?

1:11:23.613 --> 1:11:26.414
[phone rings]

1:11:26.416 --> 1:11:29.017
-Hello.
-[Mark]<i> Hello. Hi, yeah, no uh,</i>

1:11:29.019 --> 1:11:30.618
<i> I couldn't find</i>
<i> the bottle of wine I wanted,</i>

1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:31.853
so I'm going to pop down
to the supermarket.

1:11:31.855 --> 1:11:34.656
I'll be about 20 minutes.

1:11:35.592 --> 1:11:37.425
Yes. I'll see you in a bit.

1:11:37.427 --> 1:11:39.360
Love you.

1:11:39.362 --> 1:11:41.029
I don't think you're gonna find
that closure tonight, mate.

1:11:41.031 --> 1:11:42.764
-[Connie]<i> Stop it.</i>
-[Johnny]<i> How long we've got?</i>

1:11:42.766 --> 1:11:43.765
[Connie]<i> For what?</i>

1:11:43.767 --> 1:11:45.967
For this. Come on.

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:50.438
-20 minutes, and no.
Shut up. No.
-Yes.

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:52.407
-No!
-Yes!

1:11:52.409 --> 1:11:55.643
I don't understand, why won't my
fiancÃ© have sex with that man?

1:11:55.645 --> 1:11:57.812
-Some people, eh?
-Yeah.

1:11:57.814 --> 1:11:59.947
Don't be in such a twist.
Nothing.

1:11:59.949 --> 1:12:03.618
I just have zero interest in
having sex with
a fucktard like you.

1:12:04.921 --> 1:12:05.887
[door slams]

1:12:08.325 --> 1:12:10.058
Put your fucking clothes back on
now. [door slams]

1:12:10.060 --> 1:12:13.061
Jesus Christ, you're being such
a fucking bore, Connie.

1:12:13.063 --> 1:12:13.928
He's so annoying.

1:12:18.435 --> 1:12:21.903
Here you go. Good luck.

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:23.771
Thanks. Enjoy the show.

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:46.094
-Fuck me, what happened in here?
-Hello mate.

1:12:46.096 --> 1:12:48.996
-Is it warm in here?
-It is a little bit toasty,
isn't it?

1:12:48.998 --> 1:12:51.866
Hey, I didn't know you were
going to be back so soon.

1:12:51.868 --> 1:12:54.102
Yeah, well they
didn't have the wine I wanted,

1:12:54.104 --> 1:12:56.137
but then I figured
you're just going to put water
in yours anyway, so--

1:12:56.139 --> 1:12:57.839
[laughs]

1:12:57.841 --> 1:12:59.707
-Uh, Johnny.
-Yes.

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:02.143
-You like red?
-I bloody love it. Red.

1:13:02.145 --> 1:13:04.746
Good. Man after my own heart.
Just say when.

1:13:04.748 --> 1:13:05.713
Of course.

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:09.450
Oh, ah, shit!

1:13:09.452 --> 1:13:11.052
uh, Johnny, I'm so sorry.

1:13:11.054 --> 1:13:12.854
And so careless of me.

1:13:12.856 --> 1:13:14.455
-That's fine.
-It's very clearly,

1:13:14.457 --> 1:13:16.424
going to leave
a big stain on your shirt.

1:13:16.426 --> 1:13:18.559
-I sort of prefer
it that way, anyway.
-If you don't mind,

1:13:18.561 --> 1:13:20.528
-I'm just going to get
this tablecloth cleaned up...
-No, no, no, no!

1:13:20.530 --> 1:13:21.996
-No, no, good one.
-No, no,

1:13:21.998 --> 1:13:23.831
-this is
my favorite table cloth.
-No, no, no, no.

1:13:23.833 --> 1:13:25.400
Why don't you just let me
wash my own tablecloth?

1:13:25.402 --> 1:13:27.435
No, I think it's
part of the design.

1:13:27.437 --> 1:13:28.703
-My mother gave me this.
-Did she?

1:13:28.705 --> 1:13:29.971
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:13:29.973 --> 1:13:31.005
Johnny, give me,
give me it. Johnny.

1:13:31.007 --> 1:13:32.807
No.

1:13:32.809 --> 1:13:35.042
Why are you so attached
to this tablecloth, Johnny?

1:13:35.044 --> 1:13:36.577
No.

1:13:36.579 --> 1:13:39.013
Just give me
the tablecloth, Johnny.

1:13:39.015 --> 1:13:40.581
Just leave the fucking
tablecloth alone, you prick.

1:13:40.583 --> 1:13:43.017
Give me the tablecloth.

1:13:52.962 --> 1:13:56.697
-Huh.
-The thing is, mate.

1:13:56.699 --> 1:13:58.566
Yes, the thing.

1:13:58.568 --> 1:14:02.837
Well, I thought I'd just,
you know, have a little one.

1:14:03.973 --> 1:14:08.876
Right. That's your good idea.

1:14:12.982 --> 1:14:14.449
Should we do this another night?

1:14:14.451 --> 1:14:16.217
Great idea.
Fantastic.

1:14:18.822 --> 1:14:19.754
You mind if I--

1:14:19.756 --> 1:14:20.855
Yeah, help yourself.

1:14:22.058 --> 1:14:23.224
Love mint.

1:14:28.898 --> 1:14:30.064
Johnny, you should--

1:14:31.067 --> 1:14:32.800
Oh, I need those.

1:14:34.737 --> 1:14:36.070
[Johnny blows kiss]

1:14:39.776 --> 1:14:40.741
[door closes]

1:14:46.883 --> 1:14:47.982
Got you something.

1:14:47.984 --> 1:14:49.484
What's this?

1:14:51.087 --> 1:14:52.053
Prenup.

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:56.724
[door opens]

1:15:01.798 --> 1:15:02.830
[sighs]

1:15:20.750 --> 1:15:22.683
He's a sneaky bastard.

1:15:22.685 --> 1:15:24.785
Why is he doing this to me?

1:15:24.787 --> 1:15:28.756
Because deep down, sugar tits
he knows you're a conniving cow.

1:15:28.758 --> 1:15:32.627
<i> Oh, and thank you for leaving</i>
<i> me high and dry last night.</i>

1:15:32.629 --> 1:15:34.262
So, that's it then?

1:15:34.264 --> 1:15:37.665
No. No, no, no,
no, no. Not at all.

1:15:37.667 --> 1:15:40.902
You see this states that
everything he gets before
the wedding

1:15:40.904 --> 1:15:42.303
remains his.

1:15:42.305 --> 1:15:44.805
Uh, well yeah, it's a prenup.
Oaf!

1:15:44.807 --> 1:15:46.207
Shh, shh, shh, shh

1:15:46.209 --> 1:15:51.579
Just-- Shh. What I mean is

1:15:51.581 --> 1:15:53.848
he's thinking that the money
is coming in before the wedding.

1:15:54.751 --> 1:15:57.552
-And?
-And...

1:15:57.554 --> 1:15:59.820
I might just have to take
another little trip
down to accounts

1:15:59.822 --> 1:16:02.123
to delay the contract
by a few days

1:16:02.125 --> 1:16:04.725
until after the wedding.

1:16:07.263 --> 1:16:10.097
[Johnny]<i> Thank you, Johnny.</i>
<i> Oh, Johnny, you're so sexy.</i>

1:16:10.099 --> 1:16:12.600
Ooo, please, please take me now.

1:16:12.602 --> 1:16:14.302
<i> Johnny, Johnny</i>
<i> Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.</i>

1:16:14.304 --> 1:16:18.739
Something. Something.
Ugh, fuck off.

1:16:20.643 --> 1:16:23.778
[chilled acoustic music]

1:16:27.884 --> 1:16:30.217
Well,
I'm going to go out on a limb

1:16:30.219 --> 1:16:32.753
and declare this
the worst stag night ever.

1:16:34.223 --> 1:16:35.756
Yep.

1:16:35.758 --> 1:16:37.792
-Congratulations, mate.
-Thank you!

1:16:40.029 --> 1:16:42.730
Now, is it just me
or are we way past the point

1:16:42.732 --> 1:16:44.265
where we're
supposed to stop doing this?

1:16:44.267 --> 1:16:46.367
Little bit longer, pal,
it's almost over.

1:16:48.871 --> 1:16:51.205

-Hello.

1:17:08.191 --> 1:17:11.025
<i> Anyway, I wanted to double</i>
<i> check guest numbers, please.</i>

1:17:11.027 --> 1:17:13.661
I think he had
an updated list somewhere.

1:17:16.399 --> 1:17:19.967
Uh, yup, that's
four extra confirmed.

1:17:19.969 --> 1:17:21.736

1:18:12.689 --> 1:18:15.222
Hiya, which club
did you come from?

1:18:15.224 --> 1:18:17.324
-Who the hell are you?
-Having a last night
of freedom party.

1:18:17.326 --> 1:18:18.993
You don't mind, do you?

1:18:18.995 --> 1:18:21.462
Well, we are getting married
in the morning.

1:18:21.464 --> 1:18:23.764
Yeah,
but we got strippers tonight.

1:18:23.766 --> 1:18:26.333
Hence, last night of freedom.

1:18:27.737 --> 1:18:30.137
Well, have fun. I'm staying
at my friend's tonight.

1:18:30.139 --> 1:18:32.773
You sure? We got kebabs,
we got enough for everyone.

1:18:34.844 --> 1:18:38.045
I signed the prenup. Happy?

1:18:40.316 --> 1:18:42.149
Why wouldn't I be? I'm getting
married in the morning.

1:18:43.986 --> 1:18:44.985
Bye, Connie.

1:18:46.989 --> 1:18:48.756

Gonna get my head down,
get an early night.

1:19:12.982 --> 1:19:13.981
Have fun.

1:19:15.284 --> 1:19:18.018
The more for me, mate.
Come on, girls.

1:19:18.020 --> 1:19:19.854

Is there a bucket nearby? I
think-- I think I need to vomit.

1:22:13.029 --> 1:22:14.695
Hangover that bad, is it?

1:22:14.697 --> 1:22:19.199
It's not good, but Baroness von
Strap-on is not helping.

-Can't we do this sitting down?

you big lump of shite?

to witness the coming
together of Connie and Mark

1:23:55.331 --> 1:23:59.600
and to celebrate the communion
they are about to make.

1:23:59.602 --> 1:24:04.371
Is there anyone here present
who knows any reason

1:24:04.373 --> 1:24:08.142
why Connie and Mark
cannot be joined in marriage?

1:24:08.144 --> 1:24:11.678
Speak now
or forever shut your face.

You deserve
so much better than me.

Baby, baby, he's gonna
get away with our money.

1:26:15.571 --> 1:26:17.371
It's not our money,
it's his money.

Buddy, um, can I have
half a million too, please?

1:26:32.388 --> 1:26:35.422
Johnny, will you shut up.
Will you just fuck off.

1:26:35.424 --> 1:26:38.759
Take you fucking weasel dick
and your little fucking hooker
and get out.

1:26:38.761 --> 1:26:42.296
It's not really little,
and she's not a hooker,
that's her.

1:26:42.298 --> 1:26:43.363
I'm going to make a move.

1:26:43.365 --> 1:26:47.367
Alright, come on, come on.
I just need to get out of here.

1:26:47.369 --> 1:26:48.769
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:26:48.771 --> 1:26:50.337
Am I still getting my money?

1:26:50.339 --> 1:26:52.339
No, not a fucking bean.

She's a-- She's an escort.
She's an escort!

1:26:56.679 --> 1:26:57.711
There's a difference.

Sorry, everyone.

Sorry.

1:27:12.528 --> 1:27:13.460
Sorry.

1:27:13.462 --> 1:27:14.428
That's all right.

1:27:14.430 --> 1:27:16.363
I get paid either way.

1:27:16.365 --> 1:27:20.834
I don't judge, that's God's job,
and he don't exist, by the way.

It's okay.

1:27:32.715 --> 1:27:34.681
Please don't be
too touchy, Kendra.

1:27:34.683 --> 1:27:36.917
He seems to be very fond of you.

1:27:38.754 --> 1:27:41.288
-Do you think--
-You can fuck off too.

1:27:41.290 --> 1:27:42.990
Okay. Okay.

1:27:54.737 --> 1:27:56.770
Cracking wedding, fella.

1:27:56.772 --> 1:27:58.372
Yeah. We should do it
again some time.

1:27:58.374 --> 1:27:59.339
Oh yeah, definitely.

1:27:59.341 --> 1:28:02.476
So, when do I get
my half million then?

1:28:03.879 --> 1:28:05.679
How's Tuesday?

1:28:05.681 --> 1:28:06.747
It's alright, I suppose.

1:28:06.749 --> 1:28:08.348
Thanks for being so patient.

1:28:08.350 --> 1:28:10.984
By the way, what is
this invention of yours?

1:28:10.986 --> 1:28:12.686
Tim, we've lived together
for four years

1:28:12.688 --> 1:28:13.687
you don't know
what I do for a living.

1:28:13.689 --> 1:28:15.555
Honestly, no.

1:28:15.557 --> 1:28:17.324
It's an app for airline pilo--

1:28:17.326 --> 1:28:18.492
Yeah, no I'm not interested.

1:28:18.494 --> 1:28:19.626
Hello, foxy.

1:28:19.628 --> 1:28:21.295
Oh, god.

1:28:21.297 --> 1:28:23.063
Mark, I am a little bit
disappointed in you,

1:28:23.065 --> 1:28:28.402
but if you'd like to date Alexa,
we would definitely consider it.

1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:32.005
Chief.

1:28:32.007 --> 1:28:35.709
Kendra, I can't
take back what I did

1:28:35.711 --> 1:28:38.912
and it probably doesn't
mean a whole lot more to you

1:28:38.914 --> 1:28:42.416
to tell you there
hasn't been a single day

1:28:42.418 --> 1:28:44.685
where I haven't
been filled with regret.

1:28:44.687 --> 1:28:47.421
I'm truly so,
so sorry for hurting you.

1:28:47.423 --> 1:28:49.723
Here, keep yourself dry.
Bye, bye.

1:28:49.725 --> 1:28:51.091
What's wrong with you?

1:28:51.093 --> 1:28:53.493
Nothing just horny.

1:28:54.697 --> 1:28:57.764
What? Wonder where he's gone.

1:28:57.766 --> 1:29:00.901
You're disgusting.
I'm so embarrassed.

1:29:01.904 --> 1:29:04.871
Oh, Mark,
your wedding present's arrived.

1:29:07.476 --> 1:29:11.345
-Tim, no!
-Yes.

1:29:11.347 --> 1:29:15.415
-How did you afford this?
-I just popped it
on the old credit card.

1:29:16.618 --> 1:29:18.418
How long have you
hired it for, Tim?

1:29:18.420 --> 1:29:20.520
-Ach, just three months.
-Just three months, eh?

1:29:21.657 --> 1:29:23.090
Coming out of your half.

1:29:23.092 --> 1:29:26.960
Yes, sure.
Look after Ducky for me. Ducky!

1:29:30.699 --> 1:29:32.632
[car engine revving]

1:29:35.738 --> 1:29:40.140
Well, at least Tim
isn't going to sleep
with both of your parents again.

1:29:40.142 --> 1:29:42.743
If I didn't know any better
I'd say,

1:29:42.745 --> 1:29:43.777
you're kind of enjoying this.

1:29:43.779 --> 1:29:45.679
[giggles] Maybe. A little.

1:29:47.716 --> 1:29:51.151
[Mark]<i> If I'm being honest,</i>
<i> all my life I've come across</i>

1:29:51.153 --> 1:29:54.888
<i>like a lobotomized hamster when</i>
<i>it comes to understanding women.</i>

1:29:54.890 --> 1:29:56.990
<i> And at the age of 30,</i>
<i> having just blossomed</i>

1:29:56.992 --> 1:29:58.925
<i> into a multi-millionaire</i>

1:29:58.927 --> 1:30:01.862
<i> I know even less.</i>

1:30:01.864 --> 1:30:03.630
<i> So, If you think I'm giving up</i>

1:30:03.632 --> 1:30:06.433
<i> on that cold-hearted,</i>
<i> gold-digging trollop</i>

1:30:06.435 --> 1:30:10.937
<i> just as she's starting</i>
<i> to like me, think again.</i>

1:30:10.939 --> 1:30:13.907
[music playing]

1:31:26.515 --> 1:31:28.014
[loud sobbing]

1:31:28.984 --> 1:31:31.885
There, there. Cry your tiny
little eyes out.

1:31:31.887 --> 1:31:33.753
That'll make it all better.
Yeah.

1:31:33.755 --> 1:31:35.655
[blows nose and chokes]

1:31:35.657 --> 1:31:37.591
How could she do this to me?

1:31:37.593 --> 1:31:39.893
It's like I already told you.

1:31:39.895 --> 1:31:45.232
She is a lying, cheating shit.

1:31:45.234 --> 1:31:47.100
[coughs and crying]

1:31:48.604 --> 1:31:50.237
The best thing
you can do, right?

1:31:50.239 --> 1:31:52.772
Is to chuck her out and let
me and Ducky move back in.

1:31:52.774 --> 1:31:55.876
No, I don't want to. [crying]

1:31:57.212 --> 1:31:58.945
[Tim laughs]

1:32:00.015 --> 1:32:04.918
Well, what are you going to do
about her then? Kill her? No.

1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:07.521
