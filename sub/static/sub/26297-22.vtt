ADULT ADAM:
Ah, Mother's Day.

00:02.103 --> 00:03.337
For most families,

00:03.371 --> 00:05.073
all you'd have to do
is make breakfast in bed,

00:05.106 --> 00:06.740
but for the Goldbergs,

00:06.774 --> 00:09.009
"Smother's Day"
was the most dreaded
holiday of the year.

00:09.043 --> 00:11.445
It was a 24-hour,
nonstop snuggle fest

00:11.479 --> 00:12.946
that got worse
as we got older.

00:12.980 --> 00:15.483
Oh, my God,
what is this
disgusting glop?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.985
My one-way ticket
out of Mother's Day, sucka.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.654
Oh, balls! Oh, balls!
I completely forgot!

00:20.688 --> 00:21.989
How could you forget?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.457
It's the worst day
of our year,

00:23.491 --> 00:25.025
but it's on display
forever!

00:25.059 --> 00:27.328
ADULT ADAM:
Behold the Goldberg
mantel of shame.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.630
(OMINOUS CHORDS STRIKING)

00:32.200 --> 00:33.467
I know.
As the baby,

00:33.501 --> 00:34.968
I'm the one
who gets the worst of it!

00:35.002 --> 00:37.438
Or have you
forgotten this?

00:37.471 --> 00:39.707
This...actually...happened.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.009
Yeah, in a house full
of messed up photos,

00:42.042 --> 00:43.511
that is
for sure the worst.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.878
Please, let me join in
on your breakfast!

00:44.912 --> 00:46.847
Here,
I can make toast!
Already did.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.616
No! That's all
I'm capable of!

00:48.649 --> 00:52.019
Oh!
There she is!

00:52.052 --> 00:54.188
Guess what special day
it is, pretty lady?

00:54.222 --> 00:55.956
Happy Mother's Day!

00:55.989 --> 00:58.226
It's Mother's Day!
For me!

00:58.259 --> 01:00.060
Look what I alone
made for you!

01:00.094 --> 01:03.164
Aww, my Sugartush charred me
a Belgian waffle

01:03.197 --> 01:04.865
and put a poison flower
on top.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.735
I woke up at dawn just
to make everything right

01:07.768 --> 01:09.470
for my wonderful
mama-bear!

01:09.503 --> 01:11.905
Aw, Schmoo.
Go back to bed.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.974
Please, no!
I mean,

01:14.007 --> 01:15.809
we need him for
your Mother's Day
photo session.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.111
Oh, my day
will be plenty special

01:17.145 --> 01:18.212
with just you and Erica.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.314
(COUGHS) Ugh...

01:20.348 --> 01:21.815
(CONGESTED)
Happy Mother's Day.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.852
Sorry, but so much
sinus pressure.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.488
Oh, no!
Your cold got worse.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.023
Aw, come on!
She's clearly faking!

01:30.057 --> 01:31.992
Shame on you, Adam!

01:32.025 --> 01:34.195
For the past week,
I have been closely monitoring

01:34.228 --> 01:37.198
Erica's cough, sniffles,
sore throat,

01:37.231 --> 01:39.700
sour tummy, and
uncontrollable eye twitch.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.170
See? It does it on its own
'cause it's real.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.405
Aw. Well, I'll go put
some blankets on the couch

01:44.438 --> 01:45.906
so you can lie down
and watch TV.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.543
Yay! (CHUCKLES)

01:49.577 --> 01:50.744
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
And that's how you get out

01:50.778 --> 01:51.945
of honoring your mother.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.514
That's right.
For weeks,

01:53.547 --> 01:55.883
I've been planting seeds
of worry.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.186
A tiny cough here,
a body ache there,

01:58.219 --> 02:01.722
every day a calculated move
leading to this very moment.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.224
Bastard genius!

02:03.257 --> 02:05.593
Okay, I built a nest
for Erica on the couch

02:05.626 --> 02:07.795
and I ran Barry's blanket
through the dryer.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.963
Time for
our big photo op, Adam!

02:09.997 --> 02:11.699
Get your smile
muscles ready!

02:11.732 --> 02:13.467
Ugh, fine!
I guess I'll be the one

02:13.501 --> 02:15.603
who spends Mother's Day
with his mother.

02:15.636 --> 02:16.870
Yay!

02:16.904 --> 02:18.105
Let's just
make it super fast

02:18.138 --> 02:20.107
'cause I got big plans
today with Dave Kim.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.276
Plans?
What plans?
"Willow"!

02:22.310 --> 02:25.579
It's George Lucas'
blockbuster follow-up
to "Star Wars"!

02:25.613 --> 02:27.381
(CONGESTED) Wow,
it's like super selfish

02:27.415 --> 02:29.383
to pick some movie
over your mom.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.718
I don't even know
what to say.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.819
I do.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.421
You're a bad son.
Gah!

02:33.454 --> 02:35.756
Let's just go and take these
photos super fast

02:35.789 --> 02:37.391
'cause "Willow"!
Yay!

02:37.425 --> 02:38.992
It's Mother's Day.

I feel the need to say *

02:52.506 --> 02:53.941
* I don't know the future *

02:53.974 --> 02:57.845
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:57.878 --> 03:00.113
ADULT ADAM: It was
May 1st, 1980-something,

03:00.147 --> 03:01.782
and we were spending
some quality time

03:01.815 --> 03:04.151
with our dad
and David Hasselhoff.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.587
Whoa, wait!

03:06.620 --> 03:08.155
You guys are watching
"Knight Rider"

03:08.188 --> 03:09.323
and didn't
even invite me?

03:09.357 --> 03:10.458
Scootch!

03:10.491 --> 03:12.260
You scootch.
I'm already here.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.761
That's the best spot
on the couch

03:13.794 --> 03:15.162
and I'm sick of you
always hogging it.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.431
Damn it! I can't hear
the snooty car talk.

03:17.465 --> 03:19.166
Either sit down,
or get out.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.134
Of course
you take Erica's side.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.037
Once again, the forgotten
middle child gets screwed!

03:24.071 --> 03:25.339
Aw, not this crap.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.007
Here we go again
with your crazy

03:27.040 --> 03:28.676
middle child
conspiracy theories.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.478
Crazy real!

03:30.511 --> 03:33.013
You're constantly boned when
you're the middle child.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.948
I get the bad spot
on the couch,

03:34.982 --> 03:37.017
the runty piece
of pizza,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.819
even your crappy
hand-me-downs.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.288
You do not!

03:40.321 --> 03:42.523
Dad made me wear
your "My Little Pony" overalls

03:42.556 --> 03:43.624
'til I was nine!

03:43.657 --> 03:44.992
It's 'cause Dad's cheap,

03:45.025 --> 03:46.560
not 'cause
you're the middle child.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.728
Also 'cause
it was funny.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.862
That right?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.964
Well, I cannot wait
to move to college

03:50.998 --> 03:52.500
so I can be born anew

03:52.533 --> 03:55.235
and live free
as a non-middle child!

03:55.269 --> 03:57.505
(GROANS) Just take
my stupid spot on the couch.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.808
ADULT ADAM:
For a middle child, getting
the couch was an epic triumph,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.477
though what happened next
was Barry's first real win.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.545
Stop your cross-fire!

04:04.578 --> 04:06.046
Everyone focus on Barry!

04:06.079 --> 04:08.682
Look, a thick-ass
envelope from Penn.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.818
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Thick from Penn?

04:10.851 --> 04:11.885
You know it.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.186
I'm gonna rip the ass
out of this envelope.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.322
Yeah, go.
(PAPER RIPS)

04:14.355 --> 04:15.889
Rip out the ass.
Rip it but good.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.758
Boom!
Barry did it!

04:17.791 --> 04:19.192
Barry got in!

04:19.226 --> 04:21.729
Everyone wants Barry!
MURRAY:
Whoo-hoo!

04:21.762 --> 04:22.963
That makes
three colleges!

But this is
the one, baby!

04:24.765 --> 04:27.835

We don't need you now.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.343
(LAUGHS)
Did I get any mail?

04:35.376 --> 04:36.944
Classic.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.047
'Cause I just some crazy-good
mail, now you want some?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.716
Well, you're not gonna
middle child me this time,

04:42.750 --> 04:43.884
'cause
I'm going to--

04:43.917 --> 04:45.753
Going to Penn!
BOTH: What?!

04:45.786 --> 04:47.888
Geoff, I did it!
I got in!
Yes!

04:47.921 --> 04:49.357
Wait, when did you
apply to Penn?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.791
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

04:50.824 --> 04:52.893
So many questions.
How? Why?

04:52.926 --> 04:55.363
No. And when?
Also no!

04:55.396 --> 04:56.597
MURRAY:
Peanut, you did it!

04:56.630 --> 04:57.798
How is this
even happening?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.600
Well, it was
a hard year,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.370
and once my band was causing
me more stress than joy,

05:02.403 --> 05:03.437
Geoff made me realize

05:03.471 --> 05:04.905
that I really needed
some direction.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.774
All I did was get her
transcripts,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.075
fill out
the applications,

05:08.108 --> 05:09.977
and then cash in
my Bar Mitzvah bonds
to cover the fees.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.579
I always
liked this kid.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.113
(MURRAY LAUGHS)

05:13.146 --> 05:14.815
No! No! No!

05:14.848 --> 05:16.249
Dad, check it out.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.985
This weekend,
there's an orientation event

05:18.018 --> 05:20.153
at this swanky-ass house
in Chestnut Hill.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.923
That's my swanky-ass
orientation event.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.324
Yeah,
that's great, pal,

05:24.358 --> 05:26.960
but this Erica news
is the best. The best!

05:26.994 --> 05:29.763
This is my special moment,
and she stole it!

05:29.797 --> 05:31.765
Once again, the middle child
gets screwed.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.768
I demand you call me peanut
and twirl me, damn it!

05:34.802 --> 05:36.169
Don't touch my body.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.506
Absolutely not!
Ah, my back!

05:38.539 --> 05:40.307
Let's roll, boopie.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.976
So, that's the end of that?
We good?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.311
We're great.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.680
Just look at all the stuff
our faces are on!

05:51.552 --> 05:52.853
(BABY TALK) baby bib,

05:52.886 --> 05:54.488
(NORMAL VOICE) beach towel!

05:54.522 --> 05:56.089
Why would I want
a towel of us?

05:56.123 --> 05:59.092
Uh, so when
you're at the beach
or getting out of the shower,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.128
you can remember
who loves you most?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.963
And here I thought
it was weird.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.197
Doesn't matter,
I'm off to go see "Willow."

06:04.231 --> 06:05.766
Ta!
No "ta"!

06:05.799 --> 06:08.602
I made us reservations
for brunch and Flamenco
lessons

06:08.636 --> 06:10.270
and a couple's
foot soak.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.640
While that all sounds
fun and also gross,

06:12.673 --> 06:14.608
you promised
I could go see "Willow."

06:14.642 --> 06:15.943
I didn't
promise "Willow."

06:15.976 --> 06:18.512
You want "Willow,"
but I think we both know

06:18.546 --> 06:20.814
there will be no "Willows"
of any kind today.

06:20.848 --> 06:21.982
You don't understand.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.651
"Willow" is
the most important movie

06:23.684 --> 06:25.152
in a generation.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.154
And I'm the most important mom
in a generation!

06:27.187 --> 06:28.321
Mom trumps "Willow."

06:28.355 --> 06:29.790
It really doesn't!

06:29.823 --> 06:31.859
In 30 years,
people will talk about

06:31.892 --> 06:34.194
how the "Willow" trilogy
changed their lives.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.363
No! No "Willow" for you,
I mean it!

06:36.396 --> 06:39.232
I get one Mother's Day
a year and I'm taking it.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.502
This is what I get
for being nice to you

06:41.535 --> 06:42.670
almost
the whole morning?

06:42.703 --> 06:45.038
Okay! That's it!
No "Willow" for you ever!

06:45.072 --> 06:46.674
You can't just
forbid me from "Willow"

06:46.707 --> 06:48.341
for the rest of my life!
I just did.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.210
Gah! I hate you!

I ditched my mom on
Mother's Day to see "Willow."

07:12.065 --> 07:13.601
And when it was over...

07:13.634 --> 07:15.268
I had seen "Willow."

Val Kilmer was totally
in the movie!

07:20.641 --> 07:23.043
He was, wasn't he?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.344
Wow.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.514
Aw. Aw, man.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.715
Everything okay?

07:27.748 --> 07:29.282
I kind of went to the mat
on this "Willow" thing

07:29.316 --> 07:30.684
with my mom.
How so?

07:30.718 --> 07:32.620
Well, she said,
"No 'Willow'."

07:32.653 --> 07:35.756
And then I got very emotional,
cause, you know, "Willow."

07:35.789 --> 07:37.090
So I said, "Yes 'Willow',"

07:37.124 --> 07:39.259
and then she said,
"No 'Willow'," again,

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
and then
I said I hate her.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.297

you hate her
on Mother's Day?

was "Willow" at the time.

not cool, bro!

07:55.475 --> 07:57.044

07:57.077 --> 07:58.979
I told you
not to touch my body.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.214
Okay.
I can see you're mad,

08:01.248 --> 08:04.051
but for the record, this whole
thing could have been avoided

08:04.084 --> 08:06.554
if you just cried tears of joy
and twirled me.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.121
Just get me
more ice, moron!

08:08.155 --> 08:10.323
You heard him, Geoff.
I did.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.793
Dude, why are you freaking out
just 'cause I got into Penn?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.962
'Cause college is supposed
to be the place

from your hateful shadow!

take my college!

was a mistake.

I know we had
a little dust-up earlier,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.572

special for me Madre.

is done.

all right.

supposed to mean?

gone to extreme lengths
to avoid me.

to cough for six weeks

of today.

Of course.

my special baby
still loved me.

"I hate you."

a certain applicant

15:14.381 --> 15:17.350
lied to admissions about
flunking out of music college.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.885
Would Penn
wanna know about it?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.820
That's an extremely
specific question,

15:20.853 --> 15:22.422
but I guess
we'd look into it.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.923
Now, about
declaring a major...

15:23.957 --> 15:26.393
Would it also be concerning
if another applicant

15:26.426 --> 15:28.695
was so selfish
that he'd jeopardize
his sister's future,

15:28.728 --> 15:30.430
and also once
he pooped on the bus?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.099
Another very specific
question.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.800
I think I misheard you.
What happened on the bus?

15:33.833 --> 15:35.668
I can speak
to that hypothetical

15:35.702 --> 15:37.537
and assure you
that only happened

15:37.570 --> 15:39.872
'cause the facilities
at Colonial Williamsburg

15:39.906 --> 15:41.274
were inadequate.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.443
Would the school
also reconsider an applicant

15:43.476 --> 15:44.944
because he challenged
a horse to a fight

15:44.978 --> 15:46.646
on more
than one occasion?

15:46.679 --> 15:49.749
Or is that the kind
of passionate individual

15:49.782 --> 15:51.218
Penn is looking for?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.652
No. Definitely not.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.787
Should the university
be aware

15:54.821 --> 15:57.290
that a certain student
once sling-shotted

15:57.324 --> 15:59.559
her training bra
at Donnie Wahlberg

15:59.592 --> 16:00.893
at a New Kids concert?

16:00.927 --> 16:02.695
Should the university
also be aware

16:02.729 --> 16:04.564
that another certain student
practiced kissing

16:04.597 --> 16:06.099
on a Miss Piggy puppet?

16:06.133 --> 16:09.769
Hey! The university
must know the facts!

16:09.802 --> 16:12.605
You accepted
an incoming freshman

16:12.639 --> 16:14.641
who was busted
in kindergarten

16:14.674 --> 16:16.043
for eating paste.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.144
How dare you?!

16:17.177 --> 16:18.545
And it had
glitter in it.

16:18.578 --> 16:22.315
Regardless,
you accepted a student
who will ruin my life!

16:22.349 --> 16:24.251
Okay. Um, I'm thinking
this, uh, Q&A

16:24.284 --> 16:25.685
got a tad off topic.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.587
I'm not
ruining your life!

16:27.620 --> 16:29.822
I'm just trying
to turn mine around!

16:29.856 --> 16:31.758
You think it sucks
being the middle child?

16:31.791 --> 16:33.326
Well, try being
the oldest!

16:33.360 --> 16:34.727
My whole life,

16:34.761 --> 16:37.430
Mom and Dad have held me up
to some unrealistic standard

16:37.464 --> 16:39.466
that I will never
live up to!

16:39.499 --> 16:42.102
So, instead of hating me
for always being second,

16:42.135 --> 16:43.836
how about you thank me,

16:43.870 --> 16:46.005
because I would give anything
to be in your shoes!

16:47.240 --> 16:48.508
Penn's all yours.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.177
But just
so you know,

16:50.210 --> 16:52.912
I was excited to go
to college with you.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.781
I thought
it'd be fun.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.349
**

16:57.517 --> 16:59.752
ADULT ADAM:
After Mother's Day,
my mom was done.

16:59.786 --> 17:00.987
And I had the way
to undo it.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.655
Beverly.
A moment of your time?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.258
Okay.
According to you,

17:05.292 --> 17:07.494
there's one way
to undo you being done,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.862
which is to go back
to being the little boy

17:09.896 --> 17:11.464
who loved you
so much.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.633
I think we both know
that's not possible, Adam.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.034
Or is it?

17:15.068 --> 17:16.203
(GASPS)

17:16.236 --> 17:18.505
What the (BLEEP)
is that, man?!

17:18.538 --> 17:20.440
You wanted me to go back
in the time machine?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.075
Well, I did it!
I'm back, baby!

17:22.109 --> 17:24.177
Oh, my God, look at you!

17:24.211 --> 17:25.845
Why would you
do this?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.181
I... I thought
you wanted me to!

17:28.215 --> 17:29.649
Sweet Lord in heaven,

17:29.682 --> 17:31.718
you look like
a cursed doll!

17:31.751 --> 17:33.686
This gesture was supposed
to show you that I love you!

17:33.720 --> 17:36.589
Adam. If you ever go to prison
for something terrible,

17:36.623 --> 17:38.391
this is the picture
they'll show,

17:38.425 --> 17:39.892
and people will look at it
and say,

17:39.926 --> 17:41.694
like, "Oh, yeah,
I get it." (CHUCKLES)

17:41.728 --> 17:44.297
You're seriously not gonna
accept this creepy photo

17:44.331 --> 17:46.399
as proof
that I love you?
No.

17:46.433 --> 17:50.237
See, this Adam used
to give me snuggles and hugs

17:50.270 --> 17:51.871
and say,
"I love you, Mama."

17:51.904 --> 17:55.074
And this Adam tells me
he hates me,

17:55.108 --> 17:57.076
and quite honestly?
I believe him.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.711
Fine!
Believe whatever you want!

17:58.745 --> 17:59.946
Gah! I hate you!

17:59.979 --> 18:01.181
And there it is.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.583
Yes, I hate you,
but also?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.718
I love you!
So much!

18:05.752 --> 18:08.355
But I also hate you,
and at the same time,

18:08.388 --> 18:10.357
I love you,
but I hate you!

18:10.390 --> 18:11.958
It can't be both, Adam.
But it can!

18:11.991 --> 18:13.893
I hate that you're a nudge
that expects me

18:13.926 --> 18:16.095
to dry off with a towel
that has your face on it!

18:16.129 --> 18:17.564
(HUEY LEWIS AND THE NEWS'
"IF THIS IS IT" PLAYS)

18:17.597 --> 18:19.065
But I love that you blindly
support everything that I do!

18:19.098 --> 18:23.603
So, yes, I hate you,
and I love you.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.438
Maybe you're done
being my mom,

18:25.472 --> 18:27.507
but I will never be done
being your son.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.042
* And tell me
that you need me *

18:30.076 --> 18:32.412
* Girl don't cry *
That is the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.214
* And tell me
nothing's wrong *
Really?

18:34.247 --> 18:35.448
Of course.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.016
* I'll be all right *
And let's be honest.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.685
I couldn't be done
even if I wanted to.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.052
* One way or another

18:40.086 --> 18:42.121
* So, let me go *

18:42.155 --> 18:43.456
* Or make me want to stay *

18:43.490 --> 18:44.891
* If this is it *

18:44.924 --> 18:46.593
* Ooh, wop *

18:46.626 --> 18:48.428
* Please let me know *

18:48.461 --> 18:49.962
* Ooh, whoa *

18:49.996 --> 18:51.731
* If this ain't love *
Hey.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.932
* You better let me go *
Go away.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.100
No.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.302
* If this is it *
(SIGHS)

18:55.335 --> 18:56.803
We got to talk about college.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.538
* I wanna know, oh, oh *
Why?

18:58.571 --> 18:59.972
You got what you wanted.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.974
* If this ain't love, baby *
You're going to Penn
on your own.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.576
* Just say so *
You're no longer
the middle child.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.044
Did you mean
what you said?

19:05.077 --> 19:07.113
You really wanna
go to college with me?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.715
Yes.

19:08.748 --> 19:12.485
I went on my own
and completely screwed up.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.821
Honestly, it seemed
way less scary

19:14.854 --> 19:16.623
when I thought
you'd be there, too.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.491
I always thought it was easy
being the oldest,

19:18.525 --> 19:20.660
but I get it now.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.128
You have to do
everything first

19:22.161 --> 19:24.096
and pave the way
for the rest of us.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.966
That I do.
Doesn't matter anymore.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.936
'Cause Penn's about to get
a double dose
of the Goldbergs.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.070
You mean it?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.905
See you around campus?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.073
* If this is it *

19:34.106 --> 19:35.442
Not if I see you
first.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.678
I might just be
the happiest I've ever been.

19:38.711 --> 19:42.449
I've got two kids
going to college.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.351
Who wants a hug
and a twirl?

19:44.384 --> 19:45.718
(GASPS)
All you.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.854
* Please let me know *

19:47.887 --> 19:49.589
(CHUCKLES)
We'll twirl later.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.792
ADULT ADAM: That night,
my brother realized
that being in the middle

19:52.825 --> 19:54.927
meant being surrounded
by people who love you.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.764
* Please let me know *
Nothing felt better.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.599
This one may just be
my favorite.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.501
(CHUCKLES) Even though
you said you hated me

20:01.534 --> 20:02.869
on Mother's Day
and made me cry.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.272
I'm gonna hear about this for
the rest of my life, aren't I?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.840
I'm sure I'll forget
in about 30 years.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.976
* Ooh, ooh *

20:10.009 --> 20:11.678
* Just say so *

20:11.711 --> 20:13.212
* If this is it *

20:13.246 --> 20:15.415
**

20:16.749 --> 20:18.551
Hello, everyone.
We're here with

20:18.585 --> 20:20.720
the one, the only
Beverly Goldberg.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.988
Is it true?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.956
Did Adam really say
"I hate you" on Mother's Day?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.825
Those were
his exact words.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.327
"I hate you, Mom."

20:27.360 --> 20:29.195
And it was
particularly hurtful

20:29.228 --> 20:31.097
because Adam
was my youngest,

20:31.130 --> 20:33.199
and he used to hang out
with me all the time.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.536
I was devastated and cried
when he said those words.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.671
Have you ever been "done"
with your kids?

20:38.705 --> 20:40.373
Yes,
for about two hours.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.075
No matter
what they do in life,
they're mine for life.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.011
If you had to take a break
from one of your sons,

20:45.044 --> 20:46.679
which one of them
would you be done with?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.180
I thought
you were gonna ask me

20:48.214 --> 20:49.416
who would take
a break from me.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.183
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:53.052 --> 20:54.987
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about "Willow,"

20:55.021 --> 20:56.523
and I gotta say,
the movie stayed with me.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.858
Me too, bro!
I mean, Val Kilmer!

20:58.891 --> 21:00.059
Val Kilmer!

21:00.092 --> 21:02.329
That dude is awesome
in everything he does.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.197
"Top Secret," "Real Genius,"
"Lost Boys."

21:05.231 --> 21:07.033
Val Kilmer
isn't in "Lost Boys."

21:07.066 --> 21:08.200
Of course he is.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.102
He's the vampire
with the face and the fangs.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.506
I will bet you 20 large that
you are dead wrong, Dave Kim.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.174
You are so on!

21:15.207 --> 21:17.510
We'll just go to the public
library, scan the microfiche,

21:17.544 --> 21:19.946
and pore over
every People magazine on file.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.049
After hours of researching
and cross-referencing, boom!

21:23.082 --> 21:24.517
We will have
our answer!

21:24.551 --> 21:26.453
Dude. Our modern world
is awesome.
