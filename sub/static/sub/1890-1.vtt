Your enemies are disappearing.

01:09:06.682 --> 01:09:09.600
Yet you are unsatisfied.

01:09:09.602 --> 01:09:11.352
Forgive me,

01:09:11.353 --> 01:09:14.439
<i>but you are addicted to worry.</i>

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:17.317
No.

01:09:17.318 --> 01:09:19.902
What is it then?

01:09:19.903 --> 01:09:21.654
Nothing.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:24.240
I was just thinking.

01:09:24.241 --> 01:09:26.241
Yes?

01:09:30.747 --> 01:09:33.707
At the end of the game,

01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:37.709
the pawn and the king
go into the same books.

01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:41.131
I don't understand.

01:10:05.574 --> 01:10:08.574

01:10:59.378 --> 01:11:02.378
[CHEERING]

01:11:15.477 --> 01:11:18.477
What was that?

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:51.510
[GRUNTING]

01:15:00.118 --> 01:15:01.327
Goro.

01:15:01.328 --> 01:15:03.328
Who are you?

01:15:10.253 --> 01:15:14.715
Namiko married a kaiju.

01:15:14.716 --> 01:15:18.594
You know Namiko's dead,
you son of a bitch.

01:15:18.595 --> 01:15:21.595

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:10.370

[YELLING]

01:17:30.685 --> 01:17:32.520
Casey-sen.

01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:34.522
I'm very happy you are alive.

01:17:34.523 --> 01:17:36.023
Thank you, senpai.

01:17:36.024 --> 01:17:39.024
Tea?
Please.

01:17:43.865 --> 01:17:46.665
So, tell me, what happened?

01:17:49.287 --> 01:17:51.287
Excuse me.

01:18:38.962 --> 01:18:40.921
What is our goal?

01:18:40.922 --> 01:18:43.549
To thrive in the shadows

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:48.095
as our enemies die
in the sunlight.

01:18:48.096 --> 01:18:51.307
It was you.

01:18:51.308 --> 01:18:54.310
What?

01:18:54.311 --> 01:18:57.646
You set this whole thing up.

01:18:57.647 --> 01:18:59.982
You sent those thugs
to attack me.

01:18:59.983 --> 01:19:02.983
And you were in Osaka the
minute after Namiko was killed.

01:19:08.325 --> 01:19:12.494
Lucas, too.

01:19:12.495 --> 01:19:14.495
How could you?

01:19:19.044 --> 01:19:21.045
It was not personal.

01:19:21.046 --> 01:19:23.047
Not personal?

01:19:23.048 --> 01:19:26.048
You needed proper motivation.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.846
You turned me into an assassin.

01:19:30.847 --> 01:19:33.974
I had to.

01:19:33.975 --> 01:19:38.312
Goro was becoming a big
problem for my operation.

01:19:38.313 --> 01:19:42.608
I couldn't take a
chance to get exposed.

01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:46.445
You were the only one who was
skilled enough to find Goro.

01:19:46.446 --> 01:19:49.865
Kill him.

01:19:49.866 --> 01:19:51.866
Been special.

01:19:56.456 --> 01:19:58.456
She was pregnant.

01:20:04.839 --> 01:20:08.884
I didn't know.

01:20:08.885 --> 01:20:12.471
Casey-sen,

01:20:12.472 --> 01:20:15.849
there are only two choices now.

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:19.895
Either we join forces

01:20:19.896 --> 01:20:23.232
or one of us must die.

01:20:23.233 --> 01:20:26.944
There's only one choice.

01:20:26.945 --> 01:20:28.740
I see.

01:20:31.741 --> 01:20:34.741
