<i>My Papa was the hardest
working person I ever met,</i>

01:18.665 --> 01:22.159
<i>spending almost every day
of the year on the road.</i>

01:29.667 --> 01:32.028
<i>But, whenever he had time off,</i>

01:32.066 --> 01:34.027
<i>he would race home to see us...</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:36.678
Maximo! Sara!
Your father is here.

01:41.036 --> 01:43.364
<i>Even if he had
to drive all night.</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:48.274
Move!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.123
I'm okay...

02:08.002 --> 02:11.963
<i>My Papa always said,
"You get what you work for,</i>

02:12.002 --> 02:13.530
<i>"not what you wish for."</i>

02:14.504 --> 02:16.632
<i>So much for hard work.</i>

02:19.139 --> 02:20.769
This is a nightmare.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.152
I know it's horrible living here,
but we're still a family.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.191
I don't need a family.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.991
What I need is somewhere to live
that isn't an old wreck.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.700
When I'm older, I'm
going to be an architect.

02:38.701 --> 02:42.372
So I can build a
big house for us.

02:44.373 --> 02:48.000
What are you going to do?
- I'm going to sleep  so I can be sleeping.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.996
What are you going
to do for work?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.880
I'm going to be rich
so I don't have to work.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.219
But Papa always said
that you get what you

02:58.220 --> 03:00.982
work for,
not what you wish for.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.280
And look what
happened to him!

03:04.393 --> 03:08.155
It's time to sleep, children.
- We're already asleep.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.188
Look...

03:12.693 --> 03:14.693
This is who I'm going to be.

03:14.778 --> 03:20.776
He didn't get that rich
without having a job.

03:21.022 --> 03:22.061
No, no, no, no.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.673
I don't want his job.
I want hers.

03:31.110 --> 03:33.643
Maximo.

03:42.943 --> 03:45.028
Hi Maximo.

03:50.710 --> 03:53.014
You'll like that, Maximo.

03:58.177 --> 03:59.998
Thank you.
- Thank you!

04:02.242 --> 04:05.326
Talk to me, Rafa.
What's on the menu?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.710
Take a look at lounge
chair number three.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.827
There's a hot one over
there, super rich!

04:09.875 --> 04:11.432
I see her, I see her.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.528
She looks delicious.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.218
Who is she?
- Peggy von Strauss.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.773
Fifty-five, divorced...

04:25.807 --> 04:27.847
But she's loaded.
- Yeah?

04:27.893 --> 04:30.903
Her family owns the biggest
supermarket chain in the United States.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.107
She's perfect.

04:59.649 --> 05:02.171
Oh! I think I'm
making you wet.

HOW TO BE A
LATIN LOVER

06:07.122 --> 06:10.746
You know, no I can't. I have my
helicopter lesson this weekend.

06:37.324 --> 06:38.963
Spot!

06:43.557 --> 06:45.179
Spill.

07:00.557 --> 07:02.364
Shadow!

07:15.291 --> 07:16.286
Finished.

07:24.326 --> 07:26.221
Maximo!

07:27.293 --> 07:30.522
There you are, my raindrop.

07:30.562 --> 07:33.456
I was just, just on my way
to wake you

07:33.494 --> 07:36.223
Do you know what day today is?

07:36.259 --> 07:40.145
Tuesday.
- No! It's Saturday.

07:40.180 --> 07:43.777
Close enough.
- Happy anniversary!

07:44.197 --> 07:45.458
Oh! Yeah.

07:47.495 --> 07:50.253
Just what I needed.
- Really?

07:50.288 --> 07:52.756
So different.

07:52.791 --> 07:56.003
This one says 9:20,
this one doesn't.

07:57.972 --> 08:01.060
I love it. Thank you, thank you.
I love it.

08:07.876 --> 08:10.198
I got you something too.
- Really?

08:11.455 --> 08:12.648
Where is it?

08:15.153 --> 08:16.314
We have...

08:18.086 --> 08:21.048
to go... pick it up.

08:21.089 --> 08:23.416
How exciting!
- I know!

08:23.454 --> 08:25.315
I'll be right back.
- Right.

08:25.353 --> 08:30.447
Just one second. - I'm waiting
for you. I'm ready for you.

08:30.487 --> 08:33.739
I'll be but a second,
sweetie.

08:40.251 --> 08:43.248
One second.
- I'm here.

08:57.821 --> 08:59.447
Happy anniversary!

09:02.389 --> 09:04.841
Darling, what a sweet
thought. - Get in. Get in!

09:05.451 --> 09:07.459
I would, but with my knees,

09:07.748 --> 09:10.853
I'm afraid it's too close
to the ground for me.

09:14.152 --> 09:15.144
Okay, forget it.

09:16.554 --> 09:17.613
We won't get it then.

09:18.167 --> 09:22.135
I don't want my knees to
ruin our special day.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.590
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

09:26.578 --> 09:29.460
Let's get in.
It could be your car too.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.287
Yeah, I suppose
that could work.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.480
We'll take this one.
- It's a fine choice.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.549
You know the McLarens
are like snowflakes,

09:41.847 --> 09:43.240
and no two of
them are the same.

09:44.419 --> 09:46.632
Is that true?
- Actually it doesn't, but...

09:47.519 --> 09:50.118
I still think it's a lovely image
with the snowflake. Don't you think?

09:51.286 --> 09:54.080
Are you the charmer?
- Call it the romantic in me.

09:54.411 --> 09:57.510
The guys in the floor calls me the poet,
these boneheads. They like to make fun.

09:57.992 --> 10:00.040
And what form of payment will
you be using today, sir?

10:01.356 --> 10:02.402
Her.

10:03.427 --> 10:05.405
Very good. I'll see if that's
an option in our system.

10:10.287 --> 10:13.169
Are you se...
Another new car!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.907
Yep. - How do
you do, Mr. Maxwell?

10:16.878 --> 10:19.804
Once you lower your expectations,
Timmy, the sky is the limit.

10:23.563 --> 10:25.684
That's the most beautiful thing
I've heard in my entire life.

10:26.885 --> 10:29.895
Four! - You don't mind if Max
and I play  a few holes, do you?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.644
Not at all. As long as you
play a few holes with me later.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.549
You are a naughty girl.
- Here we are.

10:37.157 --> 10:38.381
A steak and a salad.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.332
Aha, mama likes
you slim and trim.

10:50.851 --> 10:55.456
You want me to feed you
some meat. - I want it so bad.

10:57.653 --> 11:00.474
This first bite is all fat.
- Hey buddy.  - Oye, brother.

11:01.554 --> 11:04.246
Millicent. You look
radiant as always.

11:04.657 --> 11:08.867
Have I ever told you that you
remind me of Senor Rojas?

11:08.911 --> 11:12.870
He was my Spanish professor
in college,

11:12.914 --> 11:16.914
with whom I had a
passionate affair...

11:18.086 --> 11:21.505
Yes, I think you mentioned
it once or twice...

11:21.713 --> 11:23.333
Or every time I see you.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.446
Let's hit the links.
- Yes!

11:33.917 --> 11:37.744
Wanna grab a drink tonight?
- Nope, sorry. No offense,  got me booked up.

11:37.785 --> 11:41.082
Got a bleaching appointment.
- You should try it some time.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.878
I brush my teeth.
- I'm not talking about the teeth.

11:45.015 --> 11:48.377
Ouch!
- Gotta keep it white and tight.

11:48.852 --> 11:52.879
Guys like you and me,
we hide in the tall grass,

11:52.919 --> 11:56.578
wait for the most beautiful gazelle
to come up from the back of the pack,

11:56.618 --> 11:59.714
drops her head to get that last
drink of water and then we strike.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.684
Thrill of the hunt.
- Wait.

12:01.784 --> 12:04.646
Aren't the sickly ones
usually at the back of the pack?

12:04.686 --> 12:06.498
What do you know about animals?
What are you, Steve Irwin?

12:06.762 --> 12:08.203
Rest in peace.
- I watch a lot of animal shows.

12:08.816 --> 12:10.691
You're missing my point.
- You know what, Rick,

12:11.817 --> 12:14.548
I don't have to worry about
hunting old gazelles anymore

12:15.016 --> 12:16.611
because in my marriage,

12:18.485 --> 12:20.003
I call the shots.

12:23.651 --> 12:25.824
Would have been a lot cooler
if I sank that.

12:40.083 --> 12:43.024
I loved that you got
yourself a matching McLaren.

12:43.750 --> 12:47.514
We only played nine holes because
I wanted to get back home to you.

12:48.019 --> 12:51.791
Maximo, you're home early.
- I missed you. What's wrong?

12:52.717 --> 12:55.432
Did you get winded trying to
scrap cook again?

12:55.517 --> 12:58.546
It was a nice refreshing beverage
after the workout we did...

12:58.585 --> 13:01.649
Hey! You're back!
Hey, how you liking the car?

13:02.083 --> 13:03.795
Handles like a beauty,
doesn't she?

13:04.783 --> 13:08.545
You cheated on me with
a car salesman? - No, a little.

13:08.584 --> 13:10.243
Remy. Here you go.

13:10.278 --> 13:12.479
The number on the bottom
doesn't work anymore

13:12.518 --> 13:13.853
but the top one is good.
Call any time, okay?

13:14.451 --> 13:16.112
You want a drink?
The bar here's incredible.

13:16.151 --> 13:17.325
Well, I don't have to tell you.

13:18.684 --> 13:21.693
I'm sorry, Maximo.
It's over.

13:22.483 --> 13:24.237
You sneeze, you lose, ese.

13:24.951 --> 13:30.013
Okay. But, half of
everything is mine. - Actually, no.

13:30.049 --> 13:35.479
You signed a prenuptial agreement.
- No, no, no. I signed a prenup.

13:36.986 --> 13:39.609
No. Shit!

13:39.839 --> 13:43.509
I can't believe this.
After I gave her my best years,

13:43.551 --> 13:45.591
and after I gave her my youth,

13:45.637 --> 13:47.977
after I gave her the best of me.

13:48.014 --> 13:50.184
Of course, now that
my boobs have sagged,

13:50.225 --> 13:52.942
she finds someone
younger than me. Shit!

13:54.061 --> 13:55.601
I'm leaving. I'm leaving!

13:55.646 --> 13:59.065
Look, once I cross this threshold, I'm
never coming back! I won't come back! Ok.

14:00.859 --> 14:04.407
I won't come back!
It's finished!

14:04.445 --> 14:07.403
It's finished forever!
But she's going to miss me.

14:07.448 --> 14:09.318
She'll miss my seeds.

14:09.367 --> 14:12.377
Come harvest time,
she'll miss my seeds.

14:12.450 --> 14:15.712
I'm feeling like playing some
cops and robbers tonight.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.044
Spice things up

14:19.916 --> 14:23.410
I think I might need to get frisked.
- That polyester  looks a little itchy.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.478
It will suit you just fine.

14:25.517 --> 14:28.011
No, no, no, you're gonna put
it on, you're gonna love it.

14:28.048 --> 14:31.185
Whatever you want, mommy gets.
- That's right.

14:39.851 --> 14:40.910
Maximo.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.010
Rick.

14:44.547 --> 14:47.676
I'm sorry... - My God!
- I'm sorry, you scared me.

14:48.448 --> 14:51.978
Sorry, you okay? - Yeah.
- What's going on?

14:53.416 --> 14:54.710
Peggy dumped me.

14:56.749 --> 14:58.344
What the hell am I gonna do?

14:58.983 --> 15:02.310
I have no money, no home,

15:02.883 --> 15:04.772
no helicopters.
- Oh!

15:05.114 --> 15:08.030
My God! Stop hitting me!
- I'm sorry.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.110
I'm on these horse
testosterone pills,

15:10.149 --> 15:13.342
that Millicent makes me take and
it gets me a little agitated.

15:15.616 --> 15:18.622
Guys like you and me,
we're survivors.

15:18.657 --> 15:21.744
We do whatever it takes
to come out on top.

15:21.779 --> 15:24.876
Yeah, yeah. - Look at me. We're
survivors. That's what we do.  - Yes.

15:24.914 --> 15:27.505
All you need to do is
find yourself a new wife.

15:27.717 --> 15:30.096
Yes. New and improved.
- And improved!

15:30.131 --> 15:32.375
Someone who's richer
and older than Peggy.

15:32.448 --> 15:35.409
Absolutely, yeah. There's
plenty of fish in the sea.

15:35.648 --> 15:38.416
All I need is a place to stay
while I am fishing.

15:39.817 --> 15:41.845
Well, I know you haven't been
in touch for a while

15:41.881 --> 15:43.576
but you could always try
stay at your sister's.

15:44.881 --> 15:47.923
I'm not sure.
I mean, what about here?

15:48.014 --> 15:51.811
No. - Why? - Millicent insisted
every room  be reserved at all times

15:51.848 --> 15:54.085
in case she wants
to have a session.

15:54.647 --> 15:56.653
There is not a room
that we don't...

15:57.450 --> 16:00.063
There is one place.
- Great!

16:00.449 --> 16:02.871
I'm so... It's the
pills, it's the pills!

16:02.906 --> 16:04.311
I don't know how these
horses do it.

16:07.848 --> 16:10.164
This is Millicent's
grand daughter's play house.

16:13.715 --> 16:18.410
Millicent's grand daughter has excellent taste.
- Millicent's grand daughter has expensive taste.

16:18.915 --> 16:20.509
This cost a fortune.

16:20.549 --> 16:23.580
Horrible little girl. One
time she made me salt a slug,

16:23.615 --> 16:25.300
just so she could remember
how to laugh.

16:25.682 --> 16:27.853
Anyway, sleep tight.

16:28.783 --> 16:29.968
Thank you.

16:48.063 --> 16:49.454
POOPING IS
FOR EVERYONE

16:51.681 --> 16:52.709
So true.

16:56.781 --> 16:57.841
So...

16:59.480 --> 17:00.774
how do you guys know each other?

17:06.814 --> 17:09.335
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh!

17:09.878 --> 17:11.776
Thanks for letting me stay
at your house.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.280
I am sorry.
I thought it was a real toilet.

17:32.413 --> 17:35.043
Hey! Hey! Hey!

17:38.981 --> 17:42.178
Hey! Hey! Leave it alone!
That's mine!

17:42.213 --> 17:43.818
Leave me alone!

17:45.378 --> 17:48.157
NICK & SCOTT'S
WRAPSTARS

18:13.481 --> 18:14.474
Hello?

18:15.813 --> 18:18.474
Surprise! It's your brother!

18:18.513 --> 18:20.568
No sir, you've got
the wrong apartment.

18:21.646 --> 18:22.840
Hej! S... Sara.

18:28.045 --> 18:30.612
Yes?
- Sara?

18:31.713 --> 18:33.484
Who's this?

18:33.900 --> 18:35.550
It's me, your brother.

18:38.147 --> 18:40.753
Maximo?
- Yeah. The one and only.

18:42.525 --> 18:44.035
Open the door, will you?

18:48.380 --> 18:49.507
Sara?

18:51.879 --> 18:52.873
Sara?

19:00.508 --> 19:04.092
Is this for real? You show
up today,  as if it were nothing?

19:04.136 --> 19:08.476
After you didn't even bother
coming to see our dying mother,

19:08.515 --> 19:11.475
When that avocado
tree fell on her.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.898
You didn't come to see
my child when he was born.

19:13.937 --> 19:16.316
What made you think

19:16.355 --> 19:18.569
I'd have any desire to see you?

19:20.151 --> 19:23.990
You can't just show up like this.
I'm not opening the door for you! I'm not...

19:33.121 --> 19:36.700
Hey, Sara! Sarita!
- I can't believe this.

19:36.750 --> 19:40.307
Me neither! You're happy
to see me, right?  - No.

19:41.337 --> 19:44.792
What are you doing here?
- Nothing! I wanted to  see you and my niece.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.339
Nephew!
- That! Niece, no? Nephew?

19:48.385 --> 19:51.722
Niece? What did I say?
Nephew? Nephew.

19:51.763 --> 19:54.972
That's it. Nephew.
- Tell me what you want,  and then beat it!

19:56.309 --> 19:58.219
Peggy kicked me out.

19:58.269 --> 20:01.348
She took everything.
Everything!

20:01.396 --> 20:05.154
But, wasn't everything
hers to begin with? - Ok, fine.

20:05.192 --> 20:07.282
She kept everything.

20:07.319 --> 20:10.069
She even kept the
car I picked out for her

20:10.113 --> 20:11.533
to buy for me,

20:11.573 --> 20:14.370
to give her, for our anniversary.

20:14.979 --> 20:16.739
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:18.140 --> 20:20.061
I know you're angry
with me, but...

20:21.032 --> 20:24.513
Can I stay with you? - Here?
Here in my house? - Yes.

20:26.002 --> 20:29.550
I have nowhere else to stay.
- Really? You have  honestly lost your mind!

20:29.589 --> 20:32.047
You've lost your head.
- You're my sister!

20:32.092 --> 20:35.051
Oh, I'm your sister now, right?
- You've always been my sister!

20:35.094 --> 20:37.184
Oh, come on, Maximo!

20:37.221 --> 20:40.271
I can't believe what
comes out of your mouth!

20:40.307 --> 20:42.024
Don't be like this.
- Stop it!

20:45.229 --> 20:49.031
One day, and no more?
Come on.  - Really?

20:50.108 --> 20:52.489
Grab your things!
What, do you think,

20:52.524 --> 20:54.338
that I'll carry them?
This isn't a hotel!

20:57.782 --> 20:59.951
Hey, your apartment is nice.
- Thanks.

20:59.992 --> 21:03.035
Like, outside it seemed
a little... But it's cool.

21:04.811 --> 21:07.741
Oh, my goodness!
It's Hector!

21:07.778 --> 21:10.660
Hugo!
- Right. What did I say?

21:10.978 --> 21:13.907
Hugo, remember I told you I
had an ugly crazy brother

21:13.948 --> 21:16.673
who was the champion of farting?
- Yes.  - That's it.

21:16.712 --> 21:19.571
Hey how are you?
- Meet Maximo. - Hi.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.675
Look at you! You must be
six years old by now, a?

21:23.645 --> 21:26.305
I just turned... ten.

21:26.979 --> 21:28.039
Ten?

21:30.445 --> 21:33.039
I know. I was kidding.

21:33.076 --> 21:38.371
Everyone's so serious around here.
It's like, who died? - My dad.

21:40.447 --> 21:42.776
I was sorry to hear about that.

21:45.977 --> 21:48.072
Pictures! Hey,
where's my picture?

21:48.111 --> 21:50.505
I don't know.
Those are family photos.

21:50.545 --> 21:53.905
I'm family. - Uncle Maximo...
We're having chicken rice.

21:54.478 --> 21:55.538
Want some?

21:56.578 --> 21:57.638
Chicken?

21:59.378 --> 22:03.371
No. Maybe I'll have a lobster roll.
- Or maybe you don't eat?

22:10.944 --> 22:13.438
Why don't you say grace
before we start eating?

22:14.142 --> 22:17.004
I'm really sorry. Next time.

22:17.045 --> 22:20.120
This time...
- Okay, okay.

22:24.510 --> 22:28.601
Dear Lord, even though we are
eating just chicken and rice,

22:29.545 --> 22:31.386
at least we're
all here together.

22:31.810 --> 22:35.593
Well, not all of us because...
Hector's dad is dead.

22:35.744 --> 22:38.526
Hugo! His name
is Hugo. - Oh, yeah.

22:38.561 --> 22:42.436
Because Hugo is dead. - Hugo
is not dead. His fa... - Amen.

22:45.144 --> 22:46.738
Wait, wait, wait...

22:47.809 --> 22:51.338
Lord, before you go, please

22:51.376 --> 22:55.378
help me find a new wife
with a big heart,

22:55.977 --> 22:58.252
but not necessarily
a strong heart,

22:58.778 --> 23:02.337
with a high net worth,
and nice big house,

23:02.778 --> 23:05.139
who doesn't ask me to poke
her that often.

23:06.911 --> 23:08.339
Amen.

23:08.377 --> 23:10.598
Amen.
- Amen.

23:11.411 --> 23:13.960
Hey, you got a girl friend?
- No.

23:14.044 --> 23:18.082
Really? What's wrong with you?
- He's ten, Maximo.

23:18.117 --> 23:20.852
Oh! Late bloomer, a?

23:21.376 --> 23:22.763
Hugo, I have an idea.

23:22.977 --> 23:26.068
Why don't you tell uncle Max
about your science fair project?

23:26.113 --> 23:28.707
And this way, it will be
you talking

23:28.744 --> 23:31.573
and not this dummy over here.
- Okay. Sure.

23:32.443 --> 23:34.671
I'm sending a weather
balloon with a Go Pro camera

23:34.706 --> 23:37.907
to the edge of the stratosphere.
- Ou, stratosphere, wow!

23:37.942 --> 23:40.660
I've modified the Go Pro camera
to send live video stream

23:40.843 --> 23:43.940
back to earth via FM transmitter.
- Wow, transmitter, wow!

23:43.975 --> 23:46.375
The balloon's gonna go very high up.

23:46.576 --> 23:50.736
And then we're gonna see like a little
part of the earth. - Earth. Wow! - Yeah!

23:50.877 --> 23:53.200
Now I understand why he
doesn't have a girlfriend.

23:55.110 --> 23:56.803
Stop it!

24:04.744 --> 24:07.963
Wanna know what I'm
doing, uncle Maximo? - No.

24:12.877 --> 24:15.902
Oops! - You know,
I prefer my own room.

24:15.943 --> 24:18.094
And I prefer for you
to be normal.

24:18.378 --> 24:22.583
But, we get what we get.
- I'm serious. What about upstairs?

24:23.842 --> 24:27.166
Those are other
people's apartments. - Really?

24:27.201 --> 24:28.671
Really.

24:28.809 --> 24:31.441
But, hey, why don't you go knock
on their doors.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.555
Maybe they'll take you in.

24:34.043 --> 24:37.397
I love you!
- I love you mom.  - Sweet dreams!

24:39.676 --> 24:42.728
What? I guess I'll
just tuck myself in.

24:50.741 --> 24:52.568
How do you do this?

25:04.540 --> 25:05.668
My God.

25:10.076 --> 25:13.417
Uncle Maximo...
- Mm-hm?

25:14.374 --> 25:16.036
How long were you married?

25:17.374 --> 25:19.486
Twenty five years.
Good night.

25:20.575 --> 25:23.878
And you didn't have to work
that whole time?

25:24.676 --> 25:27.309
Nope. Nightie night.

25:28.042 --> 25:30.175
What did you do for money?

25:31.709 --> 25:33.486
I didn't need money.

25:34.109 --> 25:35.467
She paid for everything.

25:36.842 --> 25:38.903
You go to sleep.

25:38.944 --> 25:42.735
So now you have to find a
new wife to pay for stuff?

25:43.975 --> 25:47.481
Yep. That's the plan.
Sweet dreams.

25:48.641 --> 25:50.659
How are you going to do that?

25:52.707 --> 25:54.866
By getting a good nights sleep.

25:55.876 --> 25:59.659
Why haven't you ever visited us?
- I've been busy.  - Doing what?

25:59.741 --> 26:02.636
You just said you didn't work.
- Sara!

26:02.675 --> 26:05.869
Sara Help! Sara!
Emergency, Sara!

26:05.908 --> 26:08.616
Emergency, Sara!
- What?

26:08.959 --> 26:11.712
Aaaaaaaa!!!!

26:11.941 --> 26:15.038
I'm trying to sleep and the kid
won't stop talking!

26:15.073 --> 26:17.878
You were talking too!
- To tell you to stop talking!

26:17.913 --> 26:21.569
Still talking! - Did I tell you to
stop talking? - No, no!  - Enough!

26:22.943 --> 26:26.600
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Mira! I thought we were being robbed.

26:26.642 --> 26:29.142
I was being robbed of
my beauty sleep.

26:30.683 --> 26:31.930
Oh, God! Sh!

26:32.041 --> 26:34.800
Go to sleep. Both of you!
- Yes, mommy.

26:34.841 --> 26:37.382
And no more talking
about not talking.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.741
And no more talking
about poking either.

26:43.009 --> 26:47.055
Tattletale.
- Poke you!

27:19.141 --> 27:22.669
Did you put your homework
in your back pack? - Yes.  - Good.

27:24.707 --> 27:26.901
Morning.
- Morning...

27:26.939 --> 27:29.574
Morning.
- Morning.

27:30.538 --> 27:33.869
We have rules here. Any dish
that you use, you have to wash.

27:50.974 --> 27:53.471
I didn't know we can do that.
- We can't.

27:55.439 --> 27:57.270
So don't even think about it.

28:00.807 --> 28:04.465
Oh, James!
- Hi. - Hi!

28:04.505 --> 28:08.433
Sorry to interrupt you, you
have a guest... - I don't have a guest.

28:10.005 --> 28:12.834
Oh that? That's
my brother, Maximo.

28:12.873 --> 28:15.931
Oh! Oh! Nice to meet you.

28:16.073 --> 28:17.900
Pleasure is all mine.

28:19.375 --> 28:23.628
Agh, you know what? My door knob
is sticking again. Can you believe it?

28:23.663 --> 28:26.038
Again?
- I know. It's crazy, right?

28:26.607 --> 28:30.240
Can I borrow your tools or?
- No, don't worry about it.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.567
I'll take care of it.
- Are you sure? - Yeah.

28:33.638 --> 28:37.252
Easy. Easy peasy. I'd love to.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.567
Got a sticky knob...

28:41.605 --> 28:45.345
Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet
you there like in five minutes?

28:45.380 --> 28:47.289
Okay. You're the best.
Thank you.

28:47.874 --> 28:49.530
It's nothing.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.387
Are you a carpenter or what?

28:53.799 --> 28:56.139
When you're both the man
and the woman of the house,

28:56.177 --> 28:59.076
you have to be a handyman
and do whatever is necessary.

28:59.679 --> 29:00.902
Are you two...

29:03.872 --> 29:05.065
What you doing?

29:07.640 --> 29:09.461
What are you implying?

29:11.739 --> 29:13.408
No!

29:14.235 --> 29:17.697
I just help out when
something gets jammed in his house,

29:17.698 --> 29:19.312
or there's a
problem in his house.

29:19.938 --> 29:21.850
It's an old building.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.475
Go get dressed. Look at you. We
have to leave in five minutes.

29:24.510 --> 29:26.410
Hugo, get your stuff.
I'll meet you in the car.

29:29.438 --> 29:30.766
Sticky knob.

29:34.439 --> 29:38.836
Look, that sad man has to spin the
sign like a fool for all to see.

29:38.938 --> 29:40.285
At least he has a job.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.020
It's more than I can say
about another man in this car.

29:43.905 --> 29:45.991
Work's for suckers.

29:46.006 --> 29:49.678
Mom, uncle Maximo said the
S word. - That's not the S word.

29:49.713 --> 29:51.886
What is? - Can
I tell him?  - No!

29:52.705 --> 29:53.703
Shit.

29:56.740 --> 30:00.486
So, you're big time architect now.
- Junior architect. But, I still

30:00.521 --> 30:02.456
haven't got my own
house to design.

30:02.472 --> 30:04.394
So I am not going
to be late for work

30:04.740 --> 30:08.147
because you take two hours
to blow dry your hair.

30:08.438 --> 30:10.318
I am trusting you with my car...

30:11.873 --> 30:15.651
I am trusting you with my car and
I am trusting you with my son.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.085
You need to go out there and
find yourself a job.

30:18.504 --> 30:19.975
Pick me up at 5:00, okay?

30:20.504 --> 30:22.030
Okay, I'll try to remember.

30:22.773 --> 30:25.936
You will remember, because I have
no other way to get back home.

30:25.971 --> 30:28.642
I said I'll try. Jeez.
- 5:00!

30:28.871 --> 30:32.455
Is she always like this?
- No, I just think she doesn't like you.

30:36.373 --> 30:39.265
Wow! I smell money.

30:39.506 --> 30:42.227
How do you go here?
- I'm in academic scholarship,

30:42.372 --> 30:45.236
that covers some of my tuition.
My mom has to pay the rest.

30:45.905 --> 30:49.093
You can drop me off here.
- Drop you off? Are you kidding?

30:49.673 --> 30:52.711
I'll walk you in. Where do
the rich single mom's park?

30:57.139 --> 30:59.368
Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

31:05.472 --> 31:08.100
Friend of yours?
- Arden? No.

31:08.138 --> 31:11.883
I wish.
She doesn't even know I exist.

31:12.005 --> 31:15.999
Why do you say that?
- Because, she's a girl, and she's cute

31:17.004 --> 31:18.658
and I am me.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.333
You make a great point,
you are, you.

31:28.371 --> 31:30.118
How old is she?

31:33.435 --> 31:35.495
She's
turning 10 next week.

31:35.536 --> 31:39.365
I heard she's having a big birthday
party. - No, no, no. Not the kid. Her.

31:40.904 --> 31:44.397
That's Arden's grandmother.
- She's perfect.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.733
Name? - I think it's
Celeste.  - Celeste what?

31:47.771 --> 31:50.341
Celeste Birch.
- Is there a grandpa Birch?

31:50.637 --> 31:54.065
He died last year. - Great! Great.
That's great news.  He's dead!

31:55.438 --> 31:58.190
I'm so very sad.

31:59.770 --> 32:01.785
Life's a gift.

32:02.003 --> 32:05.699
Okay kid. Have a great day.
- But I thought you wanted to walk me in.

32:05.739 --> 32:07.996
What are you, a baby?
You can walk yourself in.

32:08.038 --> 32:09.939
Andale vamos.

32:10.770 --> 32:13.222
I've got work to do.

32:15.037 --> 32:16.530
Hey!

32:18.373 --> 32:20.800
May I help you?
- It's me, Maximo.

32:20.837 --> 32:23.031
I'm an old friend of Celeste's.

32:23.069 --> 32:26.697
I feel like we've
met before, right?

32:26.738 --> 32:30.699
I don't think so. - I think so.
- You're Ryan, right?  - Quincy.

32:30.736 --> 32:35.338
I knew it started with a Q
or a B or a S. Quincy.

32:35.373 --> 32:36.898
That's a great name, Quincy.

32:36.938 --> 32:39.216
I was named after
my grandfather's dog.

32:41.502 --> 32:45.029
The legacy lives on.
- Don't touch me.  - Oh, yeah.

32:45.071 --> 32:47.100
And where did you say
you met Celeste?

32:48.104 --> 32:51.464
At the sports event.

32:52.603 --> 32:55.097
The polo match.
- Yes, exactly.

32:56.902 --> 32:59.431
The one back in April.
- Yeah, that's the one.

32:59.471 --> 33:01.733
She never went to a
polo match back in April.

33:03.535 --> 33:06.563
May? - No.
- June?  - No.

33:06.601 --> 33:08.728
July? - No.
- August?  - No.

33:08.770 --> 33:11.189
September? - No. - October?
- No. - November?  - No.

33:11.224 --> 33:13.531
December? - No. - January?
- No. -  February?  - No.

33:13.571 --> 33:15.799
March.
- No.

33:15.839 --> 33:18.203
April.
- You already said April.

33:19.568 --> 33:21.124
And you said?

33:21.770 --> 33:23.471
No.

33:23.971 --> 33:29.107
Oh, oh, I am so sorry.
I must have gotten confused.

33:30.503 --> 33:32.651
March. - No.
- Of course. Thanks.

33:38.570 --> 33:39.864
Pizza delivery.

33:43.602 --> 33:45.763
Hey man, what's up?
I'm a little busy.

33:45.801 --> 33:49.578
Listen, I think I found my next wife.
- You've heard of Celeste Birch?

33:49.613 --> 33:52.864
<i>Celeste Birch?</i>
She's worth  10 Peggy von Strauss's.

33:52.901 --> 33:55.092
<i>You ever meet her?
- I haven't had the pleasure.</i>

33:55.127 --> 33:57.924
But, Millicent was supposed to
go her charity function today

33:57.959 --> 34:00.606
at the Pacific Woodruff.
- Pacific Woodruff, today?

34:00.641 --> 34:04.529
Yeah. I mean, go get her.
<i>He's the best 500 bucks you ever spent.</i>

34:04.969 --> 34:08.696
500 dollars! - <i>Yes, that's
the cost of the charity ticket.</i>

34:08.737 --> 34:10.431
That seems like the
opposite of charity.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.462
Pizza boy...
- I've got to go. Duty calls.

34:13.668 --> 34:17.364
One extra large
sausage. That'll be $17.15.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.480
I'm afraid I don't have
any change.

34:20.514 --> 34:22.996
Well, maybe we'll have to
work something between us.

34:24.835 --> 34:26.763
Maybe...

34:27.801 --> 34:29.496
Five hundred dollars.

34:45.802 --> 34:49.906
Hi, I need to get my car wrapped...
and I need the cash up front.

34:49.935 --> 34:53.062
Bro. Is he here about the bike?
Are you here about the bike?  - No.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.692
Bro, he's not here for this
stupid tiny bike, alright?

34:55.726 --> 34:57.285
He got the thing online,
you idiot.

34:57.502 --> 34:59.799
We all make mistakes, okay?
- You're not perfect.

34:59.868 --> 35:02.759
I misunderstood the dimensions.
- It happens.

35:02.794 --> 35:05.433
Anyway, you thought about what kind
of edge you wanna wrap your car in?

35:05.501 --> 35:07.693
Whatever... - This looked
a lot bigger on the Internet

35:07.735 --> 35:11.759
because it had a picture with a
little boy, so it seemed much bigger.

35:11.794 --> 35:13.583
Great. - How do he
not know the difference

35:14.751 --> 35:15.065
between a little
boy and a grown man?

35:15.103 --> 35:17.031
He looked older, he had a
little bit of a mustache.

35:17.067 --> 35:18.550
Look at this.
This was in the picture.

35:18.585 --> 35:21.166
It was a boy with the mustache
so I assume...

35:21.201 --> 35:22.463
Whatever pays the most!

35:24.836 --> 35:26.897
Oh, sorry.

35:26.935 --> 35:32.289
Was that rude? I'm in a rush,
that's all. I'm in a rush.

35:32.324 --> 35:34.200
Man's in a rush.
- Yes, thank you.

35:34.235 --> 35:37.364
Here's the terms. Wrap stays
on the car for ninety days.

35:37.399 --> 35:38.966
Yes. - You take
it off before that,

35:38.967 --> 35:40.532
you  have to pay
us the money back.

35:40.570 --> 35:44.019
Not a problem. Yeah.
- Leave the warp on the vehicle.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.718
Yes, I will do that. Can we
start as soon as possible?

35:48.370 --> 35:50.038
One thousand dollars.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.134
THE HOTTEST CLUB IN L.A.!

36:02.402 --> 36:06.240
Keep it close, my son.
- I don't think they will let me.

36:11.368 --> 36:12.495
Good afternoon, sir.

36:15.602 --> 36:16.696
Sir?

36:18.801 --> 36:20.462
Would you like to buy a ticket?

36:22.101 --> 36:23.461
Yes, I would.
500,00 $ per ticket

36:26.834 --> 36:29.945
Pool side. Perfect.

36:31.635 --> 36:32.728
Sir?

36:38.602 --> 36:39.661
Keep the change.

36:44.802 --> 36:46.386
Am I making you wet?

36:47.102 --> 36:49.268
Am I making you wet?

36:50.501 --> 36:51.561
Am I...

36:52.729 --> 36:54.659
I look like my grandfather.

37:07.632 --> 37:09.671
<i>Carnauba</i>
SHOE POLISH

37:58.533 --> 38:00.097
Come to papa.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.579
Is that shit?

38:20.998 --> 38:23.173
Am I making you wet?
- Ahhh!

38:23.832 --> 38:25.037
Sorry.

38:26.132 --> 38:27.791
Am I making you wet?

38:28.400 --> 38:31.061
No, no. Bone dry. Thanks for
asking, though. Come on.

38:31.900 --> 38:35.092
Unhand me, sir.
I just wanna speak to Celeste.

38:35.133 --> 38:38.297
Listen, Menudo, you think you're
the first money grabbing gigolo

38:38.546 --> 38:40.484
to throw himself at my boss?
- Maybe not the first,

38:40.782 --> 38:42.278
but I'm hoping to
be the last now.

38:42.998 --> 38:44.647
Not while I'm working for her.

38:44.682 --> 38:47.439
She's been through too much
emotionally and surgically

38:47.833 --> 38:50.313
to put up with this.
- You can't keep me away.

38:50.567 --> 38:54.458
No, I can. - No.
- Very easily I can.  - No.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.487
I just did.

38:57.841 --> 38:58.688
Yes, you did.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.480
So unless you have a written
invitation to our home,

39:02.565 --> 39:04.121
you're not going
anywhere near her.

39:05.668 --> 39:07.728
Hey, there's your clown suit.

39:07.766 --> 39:11.224
Alright, here's your...
car... toon.

39:11.295 --> 39:13.778
I kept it close just like
you asked me to, paisano.

39:14.499 --> 39:15.613
I don't speak Spanish.

39:21.865 --> 39:25.793
Hi bro. Did you make a move?
- I sort of made a move.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.270
Can you talk?
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

39:28.008 --> 39:29.463
<i>Millicent's just
taking a post coital cool off.</i>

39:30.065 --> 39:33.659
Tell me you closed her. Tell me you
closed her during silent auction.

39:33.666 --> 39:36.870
<i>She didn't even see me.
I'm not sure about this one.</i>

39:37.066 --> 39:40.270
She's impossible to
get to. I have no in.

39:50.099 --> 39:51.816
Or maybe I do.

39:55.632 --> 39:59.527
Sounds like you have an idea.
But I can't tell. I can't see your face.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.859
<i>Describe your face. - My face?</i>
- Yeah. What does it look like?

40:02.899 --> 40:05.493
Thoughtful, very handsome
with a hint of mischief.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.297
That's the spirit. Hey, I'm there
for you, whatever you need.

40:08.399 --> 40:10.917
Unless it's money. Then I can't do it.
Because I'm on an allowance.

40:10.952 --> 40:14.951
Great. Listen. Find out whatever
you can about Celeste.

40:14.999 --> 40:18.277
Interest, passions, hobbies.
When I'm invited to her home,

40:19.430 --> 40:23.041
I plan on selling the deal.
- <i>I'll ask her on the club.  - Thanks.</i>

40:23.099 --> 40:25.546
And I've got work
to do on my end.

40:31.799 --> 40:33.841
Hey. Hey!

40:34.598 --> 40:36.721
My eyes are up here. Get in.

40:40.731 --> 40:42.772
Usually we come here on Sundays

40:42.807 --> 40:45.707
because mom says it's too much sugar
to have more than once a week.

40:46.097 --> 40:47.656
Yeah.
- Wow.

40:47.697 --> 40:50.677
So, Hugo I wanna talk to you
about Arden...

40:50.697 --> 40:53.646
<i>Froyo Lo, look out
That's right</i>

40:53.681 --> 40:56.903
<i>You've got to let your
fantasies out For a bite</i>

40:57.464 --> 41:00.791
<i>Say your name...
- Hugo. - ain't no shame</i>

41:00.832 --> 41:05.727
<i>Froyo Lo, Froyo Lo</i>

41:05.763 --> 41:07.672
Do they make you sing
that every time?

41:07.698 --> 41:09.696
I get to sing that every time.

41:10.665 --> 41:13.265
You know if you guess the weight
of your yogurt, it's on the house.

41:14.530 --> 41:17.148
Five pounds.
- That's a lot.

41:17.183 --> 41:20.174
I'll give you one more guess.
- Thirty pounds.  - Let's check.

41:21.365 --> 41:24.728
Wow, they're fourteen ounces.
- I was so close.

41:24.763 --> 41:28.326
That will be six fifty.
- Hey, watch me and learn.

41:30.098 --> 41:32.128
I like your bandages.

41:32.663 --> 41:35.935
I am...
I have a lot of rescue cats.

41:35.970 --> 41:38.692
Really? - Yeah, so I'm
no stranger to scratches.

41:38.733 --> 41:40.297
I'm always bleeding.

41:41.797 --> 41:42.835
Thank you...

41:43.431 --> 41:45.991
Cindy.
- Wow. Cindy.

41:46.029 --> 41:49.020
What an enchanting name.
- Thank you.

41:49.230 --> 41:51.877
You know, if these frozen yogurts
were half as sweet as you,

41:52.796 --> 41:54.338
we're in for quite a treat.

41:57.130 --> 41:58.410
Wow!

42:00.496 --> 42:02.411
You said fourteen ounces, right?

42:03.465 --> 42:05.997
Gracias, sweet Cindy.

42:06.130 --> 42:10.390
I hope your pussy cats realize what a
beautiful scratching post they have in you.

42:11.732 --> 42:13.236
Bye.

42:14.131 --> 42:16.701
I am a beautiful
scratching post.

42:17.098 --> 42:21.013
See what I did there?
- You got us FroYo for free?

42:21.131 --> 42:24.883
No, my skills of seduction
got us FroYo for free

42:25.564 --> 42:29.275
What if I told you I can teach you
how to use your skills of seduction

42:29.310 --> 42:30.877
to get what you want.

42:30.912 --> 42:33.775
I forgot to ask
for gummy bears.

42:33.795 --> 42:36.776
Screw the gummy bears.
I'm talking about Arden.

42:37.630 --> 42:41.617
Hey, I can get you invited
to her birthday party.

42:42.729 --> 42:46.459
Would you like that? - You can't get
me invited to Arden's birthday party.

42:46.495 --> 42:48.637
Papa por favor.

42:48.672 --> 42:50.926
It's impossible.
- Somebody asked for gummy bears?

42:50.961 --> 42:54.238
They're on the house.
- Thank you, sweet Cindy.

42:54.273 --> 42:57.413
I have gummy bears coming
out of my ears, literally.

42:57.563 --> 43:01.110
Not literally, but they are in a
surprising amount of places around here.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.193
Hey, thank you.

43:05.031 --> 43:07.730
See, I can make things
happen for you.

43:13.530 --> 43:15.217
When do we start?

43:16.131 --> 43:19.819
We just did.
Okay, lesson number one.

43:20.130 --> 43:22.692
Eye contact. Follow me.

43:22.862 --> 43:24.623
Follow me. Eye contact.

43:24.664 --> 43:27.627
Okay.
- Eye contact is power, Hugo.

43:27.697 --> 43:29.821
Women will lust after you.

43:29.856 --> 43:33.327
Now, it's your turn. I am
Arden, okay? Say hello to me.

43:33.598 --> 43:37.240
Okay.
- Hello Hugo, I'm Arden.

43:37.629 --> 43:39.465
Hello, Arden.

43:39.929 --> 43:41.550
You broke eye contact.

43:42.168 --> 43:45.985
You broke eye contact.
- You threw a gummy bear at me.

43:46.020 --> 43:49.356
What? Life will throw gummy
bears at you. Okay. Do it again.

43:49.463 --> 43:52.092
Stop throwing gummy bears at me.
- Stop breaking eye contact.

43:55.995 --> 43:57.492
Hello, Arden.

44:01.029 --> 44:04.270
Not bad. Good eye contact.

44:04.628 --> 44:06.199
Not bad at all.

44:07.063 --> 44:09.742
You guys are getting real
creative with these gummy bears.

44:09.777 --> 44:12.782
Most people just eat them.
- Okay,  lesson number two...

44:12.817 --> 44:15.119
Women love when men take control

44:15.154 --> 44:17.598
because women have no idea
what they wants.

44:18.694 --> 44:21.664
I'll have the steak and the lady
would have the cobb salad.

44:21.699 --> 44:24.545
What if she doesn't want
the cobb salad?

44:24.996 --> 44:29.699
Listen, a woman would rather eat something
you ordered for her, that she doesn't want

44:29.734 --> 44:33.087
rather than something she ordered
for herself that she does want.

44:33.729 --> 44:36.648
It doesn't make sense.
Like, at all.

44:36.863 --> 44:38.626
You know what
doesn't make sense?

44:38.994 --> 44:42.002
What is that? You under
house arrest or what?

44:42.037 --> 44:44.237
It's a planetary watch.

44:44.272 --> 44:46.947
Some people call it
an astronomical watch.

44:46.982 --> 44:49.475
I'm gonna call it I'm
gonna die a virgin watch.

44:49.562 --> 44:51.677
Lose it. Let's go.

44:53.693 --> 44:56.487
Wait, uncle Maximo.
What is a virgin?

44:56.729 --> 45:00.481
It's an airline. Last
lesson of the day...  Your walk.

45:00.594 --> 45:04.368
Your walk tells more about you
than your mouth ever can.

45:04.596 --> 45:07.368
My walk? - Yes, your
walk. Show me your walk.

45:08.795 --> 45:12.161
Do I just walk? - Just walk, walk.
- Okay.  - Like you walk.

45:15.899 --> 45:17.052
Goddamned!

45:20.694 --> 45:22.944
Horse shit.
Sit and watch.

45:25.126 --> 45:28.478
Loose stride,
sleepy eyes,

45:28.513 --> 45:30.791
smiling just a little bit
because you know what

45:30.829 --> 45:34.927
all the ladies are thinking.
- What are the ladies thinking?

45:34.962 --> 45:36.323
Look at that confidence,

45:36.928 --> 45:40.263
he must be great in bed.
- I'm great in bed.

45:40.361 --> 45:43.093
What? - I don't pee
or anything anymore.

45:44.497 --> 45:46.624
Come on now,
my boy. Let's walk.

45:48.925 --> 45:52.097
Loose stride, sleepy eyes.

45:52.132 --> 45:53.273
What are you doing?

45:53.308 --> 45:56.450
Pretend there's a girl, and
you're walking towards her.

45:56.485 --> 45:58.907
Feel your sexiness.
- I don't feel my sexy.

45:58.942 --> 46:01.595
What is that? You're walking
exactly like the geese.

46:01.630 --> 46:03.499
Let's go.
Don't watch the geese, okay?

46:03.534 --> 46:08.325
A girl pass by, turn around,
walk backwards, sexy, sexy.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.813
What is this? What is this?
What is this?

46:12.492 --> 46:14.736
One more time.
Feel it in your crotch.

46:14.771 --> 46:16.817
You want everyone
to see down here.

46:16.852 --> 46:19.379
No, I don't.
- Look at me.

46:19.414 --> 46:21.688
You learn from the best.
Okay, one more time.

46:26.525 --> 46:30.122
You feel sexy right now?
- Yeah. - Great. Okay, one more time.

46:41.928 --> 46:45.572
Exactly, exactly,
exactly.

46:45.607 --> 46:48.099
There you go. Much better.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.721
Shit.
Okay.

46:51.594 --> 46:53.285
One more time.

46:53.862 --> 46:58.083
Gwen, I wanted to see if you
heard  back on the Robinson account.

46:58.118 --> 47:02.387
Sara,

47:01.792 --> 47:05.187
before you could
ask me about this.
- I know, sorry.

47:05.222 --> 47:07.837
I can ask you again tomorrow as
soon as you get out of the car.

47:07.872 --> 47:10.955
No, no.
Can't unbreak this egg.

47:10.990 --> 47:14.845
Alright, they loved you. They
thought you were incredible.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.920
But they're gonna go
with someone who has...

47:16.955 --> 47:19.210
More experience.
- Sorry, can I finish?

47:19.959 --> 47:23.496
Sorry...
Yes, yes...

47:23.531 --> 47:25.705
Someone who
has more experience.

47:26.993 --> 47:29.936
You finished?
- Yeah.

47:30.992 --> 47:32.884
I just don't know what to do.

47:32.919 --> 47:35.501
I can't get a job because
I don't have experience

47:35.536 --> 47:37.670
and I can't get experience
if I don't get a job.

47:37.705 --> 47:40.046
Hey mom.
- I'm here.

47:40.394 --> 47:44.409
5:00. I remembered. You have
nothing to complain about.

47:44.761 --> 47:47.663
I thought you'd be happy.
I got a job.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.800
Turning my car into a
stripper mobile is not a job.

47:50.835 --> 47:52.904
What's a stripper?
- It's only nine days.

47:52.939 --> 47:55.580
No, it's not. You get this
trash off my car today.

47:56.126 --> 47:57.557
Damed.
- Today!

47:58.334 --> 48:01.358
Alright now, those guys, they...
no wait, girls...

48:01.427 --> 48:04.952
they dance on
the poles naked, right?

48:17.993 --> 48:22.919
Icebergs are literally just floating
ice on the water - Wow, astonishing.

48:22.959 --> 48:26.386
So when it melts, it's like
soda, it's like bubbles.

48:26.425 --> 48:29.619
Bubbles, wow. - Carbon dioxide.
- Where's your watch?

48:29.659 --> 48:32.034
You mean,
my die a virgin watch?

48:33.360 --> 48:35.752
What did you say?
- Die a virgin watch.

48:36.125 --> 48:38.938
Kids. Where do they come up
with this stuff?

48:39.559 --> 48:41.410
Uncle Maximo told me to
take it off.

48:41.725 --> 48:45.420
He's training me to get girls
to like me. - He's training you?

48:45.459 --> 48:46.819
Yeah. - What the
hell are you doing?

48:46.861 --> 48:50.663
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It's just silly guy talk. - It's not silly.

48:50.698 --> 48:53.272
I learned how to undress
a woman with my eyes.

48:53.659 --> 48:56.347
And how to walk so a woman
would know I'm gonna bed.

48:56.594 --> 48:58.847
He said women have
no idea what they want

48:58.882 --> 49:00.824
and you have to
tell them what to do.

49:02.857 --> 49:07.064
No, I never used
those words exactly.

49:07.099 --> 49:10.282
Sure you did. I wrote it
all down in this notebook.

49:10.426 --> 49:12.072
What notebook?
- Lesson number...

49:21.425 --> 49:24.353
<i>Mira.</i> Hugo needs to
focus  on his school work.

49:24.427 --> 49:28.115
Hey, he has a crush on a girl
at school. I'm trying to help the kid.

49:29.178 --> 49:31.525
You know what it's like
to like someone! Or no?

49:31.723 --> 49:35.566
Mister "I need you to
grease my door once a week".

49:35.601 --> 49:38.386
No. You're taking
one think for another.

49:38.387 --> 49:41.974
And James is just a friend!
- Oh, my God. - You're changing the subject!

49:42.825 --> 49:46.416
No more sugar mama
catching training!

49:50.558 --> 49:53.432
Hugo already has a mother.
Understood?  - Yes, mommy.

49:53.692 --> 49:56.578
Understood?
- I don't speak English.

49:59.206 --> 50:02.468
Don't be an idiot.
- Why with a tortilla?

50:06.559 --> 50:09.452
Hey, pull my finger. Pull it.

50:12.058 --> 50:15.956
False alarm. - Yeah.
- You're writing a love letter to Arden?

50:15.989 --> 50:18.062
No, just writing to my dad.

50:19.092 --> 50:20.304
Your dad?

50:21.217 --> 50:23.169
You know he'll never
get those letters, right?

50:23.204 --> 50:24.273
I know.

50:24.524 --> 50:26.635
It's just a way
for me to feel close then.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.349
Don't you ever think
about your dad?

50:30.792 --> 50:34.036
No. - Never?
- Never.

50:34.722 --> 50:36.814
You remember anything about him?

50:37.989 --> 50:39.479
I remember he worked a lot.

50:40.023 --> 50:42.945
And he parked his truck
in our house once.

50:44.724 --> 50:46.491
There it is. Late bloomer.

50:47.926 --> 50:49.860
I remember a lot about my dad.

50:50.124 --> 50:53.772
He was fun. I think he'd
be happy that you're here

50:53.790 --> 50:55.853
and that you're helping me.

50:56.658 --> 50:58.503
That's what I was
just writing him.

51:03.023 --> 51:06.390
Uncle Maximo, can I show you
my science project?

51:06.824 --> 51:09.054
I... in the morning.

51:09.126 --> 51:10.448
Please?

51:11.658 --> 51:14.118
I know that you're
really not sleeping.

51:18.357 --> 51:20.855
Uncle Maximo, please?

51:22.356 --> 51:24.048
Okay. In the morning.

51:26.923 --> 51:29.584
Good morning. Uncle Maximo.

51:29.724 --> 51:31.561
Remember when you told me

51:31.688 --> 51:34.496
that I can show you my science
fair project in the morning?

51:34.589 --> 51:37.177
Well, here it is!
My weather balloon.

51:37.212 --> 51:39.251
And here is the Go Pro camera

51:39.286 --> 51:41.882
which will be attached
to the weather balloon

51:41.917 --> 51:44.219
which will go up in space.

51:44.756 --> 51:48.299
It's cool, right?
- Amazing.

51:48.657 --> 51:53.469
Now, will you please get it off my
face so I can go back to sleep?

51:53.504 --> 51:57.004
<i>Get up, flojo naso!</i>
Time to go get a job.

51:57.039 --> 52:01.199
Here, I circled the ones that I think
will be good for your qualifications

52:01.424 --> 52:06.601
like human statue, mattress
tester, dog poop picker upper...

52:06.657 --> 52:10.010
It's Sunday.
What place will even be open?

52:10.758 --> 52:12.161
It's Thursday.

52:13.457 --> 52:16.084
Want me to deflate the balloon?
- Let's go Hugo.

52:16.124 --> 52:19.829
The science fair is next Sunday,
the school is today.

52:19.864 --> 52:23.244
Hey, no. Hugo!
Hey, Sara!

52:23.358 --> 52:24.662
Get a job!

52:28.572 --> 52:30.505
WESCOTT CONDOMINIUMS

52:56.094 --> 52:57.542
CAR WASH
LIMITED MONTLY WASH PLAN

53:13.124 --> 53:16.764
Sorry!
- I'm okay! I am okay.

53:17.589 --> 53:19.949
He's okay.

53:26.589 --> 53:28.824
It wasn't me, it wasn't me.
I'm alright.

53:31.629 --> 53:32.861
HIGHLAND
CAFE

53:33.645 --> 53:34.943
This neighborhood
isn't that bad.

53:35.555 --> 53:37.282
I was expecting something out
of a horror movie,

53:37.590 --> 53:40.049
this is more like something out
of an independent movie.

53:40.489 --> 53:42.869
Stop trying to make me feel better.
- Stop trying to make <i>me</i> feel better.

53:44.687 --> 53:46.412
Are you teasing me?
- Teasing me.

53:46.589 --> 53:48.271
Hey, what are you doing?

53:49.023 --> 53:52.296
I'm sorry. Millicent's just
fantasizing about this...

53:52.854 --> 53:56.404
Professor Rojas. She's got me
dressing like him, talking like him,

53:56.655 --> 53:58.418
but, I can't do an accent to
save my life.

53:58.955 --> 54:01.466
And I can't sleep on an air
mattress one more night.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.668
You find any intel
or Celeste Birch?

54:05.454 --> 54:08.997
As as matter of fact, I did.
And before I share this,

54:09.456 --> 54:12.430
I don't think she's the
right mark for you. - Come on.

54:14.356 --> 54:17.984
Celeste Birch's passions, avid
mountain climber, loves train travel,

54:18.020 --> 54:19.770
favorite food, fried chicken.

54:20.122 --> 54:22.083
Great. This will help.
Thanks.

54:22.122 --> 54:25.847
Alright. It is time to go.
Anything?  - Terrible.

54:25.887 --> 54:28.916
It's time to go.
- You sound like Dora the explorer.

54:28.954 --> 54:31.172
Now's the go,
when it's time to go.

54:31.207 --> 54:34.959
Speedy Gonzales. Really.
- Alright. Ola.

54:35.889 --> 54:39.480
Everybody knows how to say that.
- And somehow you screwed it up.

54:42.854 --> 54:44.514
Hola.

54:46.055 --> 54:49.369
I'm positive, that's the car.
- But why would we pay him,

54:49.521 --> 54:51.075
if he's not gonna do it.

54:53.354 --> 54:54.759
We paid him all our money.

54:56.389 --> 54:57.682
Hey, hey, hey!

55:01.453 --> 55:03.062
Stop! Stop!

55:16.521 --> 55:18.413
Well, look who it is.

55:19.822 --> 55:22.372
No, no, no, no.
Where do you think you're going?

55:22.407 --> 55:23.915
Where you going, man?
- Just looking for you guys.

55:23.955 --> 55:25.872
I was just looking for you guys.

55:25.907 --> 55:29.999
We clearly said,
don't take the wrap off!

55:30.034 --> 55:31.296
Ever!

55:31.386 --> 55:35.520
Yes, yes, I remember and I thought you
did a great job with the wrapping.

55:35.555 --> 55:38.048
But, you see my sister
felt differently.

55:40.421 --> 55:43.335
She's your sister.
- Yeah  - Sister.

55:43.488 --> 55:47.199
Women. - Right, right.
- You don't have to tell Nick and I about that.

55:48.453 --> 55:50.853
Get his nuts.
- I got them.  - Get his nuts.

55:50.888 --> 55:54.415
I got both of them.
- I got them.

55:54.453 --> 55:58.330
You just give us our money.
We'll be fine. - I spent it. I spent it.

55:58.385 --> 56:04.453
Well, I sincerely hope you bought
something you really wanted... or needed.

56:07.354 --> 56:10.185
God, you're terrible with this.
Nick, just think before you talk.

56:10.220 --> 56:11.809
Can you do that?
- Stop.

56:11.844 --> 56:14.980
I made a mistake. I'll get you
your money, I promise.

56:17.753 --> 56:21.292
Come on guys. It's just
a thousand dollars.

56:21.327 --> 56:23.932
One week. You got one week.
- Yes.

56:24.986 --> 56:28.828
Let's go.
- I didn't see that coming. Nice!

56:28.863 --> 56:30.184
Thought we're done, right?
You feel that?

56:30.421 --> 56:34.014
Two hands. You want four hands?
- That's four hands.  - Yeah, there it is.

56:34.054 --> 56:36.072
That's four hands.
- One week.

56:39.420 --> 56:40.702
One week, home boy.

56:40.887 --> 56:44.559
We went four hands on
him, man. - That was bad ass.

56:44.594 --> 56:45.748
His balls are so big.

56:45.785 --> 56:48.415
You get that money or next time
it's eight hands.

56:48.450 --> 56:51.273
Guy doesn't have $1000,
get a job, bone head.

56:54.022 --> 56:57.362
<i>Froyo Lo look out
That's right</i>

56:57.517 --> 57:01.478
<i>You've got to let your
fantasies out For a bite</i>

57:01.519 --> 57:04.596
<i>Say your name... Jose!
Ain't no shame</i>

57:04.920 --> 57:08.006
<i>Froyo Lo!
Froyo Lo!</i>

57:08.886 --> 57:10.391
Such a good effort.

57:10.487 --> 57:14.339
It's only lacking joy, soul,
rhythm and musicality.

57:14.353 --> 57:17.065
And I would cry way less.
Maybe not at all.

57:26.488 --> 57:28.983
<i>But, what if mom finds out
we're training again?</i>

57:29.021 --> 57:33.114
Hugo, you can't live your life afraid
that something bad will happen.

57:33.149 --> 57:35.444
Or you'll never really live.
- Okay.

57:35.487 --> 57:39.101
So, you gotten her to notice
you with the sexy walk.

57:39.136 --> 57:41.543
You intrigued her with
strong eye contact.

57:41.578 --> 57:43.781
Now, it's time to talk to her.

57:43.821 --> 57:45.775
I don't think I can.

57:45.785 --> 57:50.027
Relax, Hugo. It's not like you've
never talked to a girl before.

57:50.062 --> 57:53.678
Yes, it is. I've never talked to
a girl before. - Really?  - Yeah.

57:53.719 --> 57:57.265
They make me really nervous
and then my nose start to sweat.

57:58.353 --> 58:00.522
Your nose sweats?
- Yeah.

58:00.557 --> 58:02.948
Your nose?
- Yes.

58:03.686 --> 58:06.862
I can't help you with that.
- Stop mocking me.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.527
Well, come on. Let's go.
- Well, where are we going?

58:10.562 --> 58:13.072
You're too in your head, kid.
You need to relax.

58:21.452 --> 58:25.381
I don't like the bowling
balls here. Too slippery.

58:25.418 --> 58:26.710
I'm gonna grab a
Coke. You want one?

58:27.374 --> 58:29.192
Cokes have no
nutritional value.

58:29.419 --> 58:31.235
Neither do eggplants.

58:32.352 --> 58:33.509
Okay, two Cokes.

58:41.052 --> 58:42.380
Nice form.

58:45.619 --> 58:49.080
Thanks. - My name
is Gabi.  What's yours?

58:49.987 --> 58:53.452
My name is Hugo.
- You're cute, Hugo.

58:57.120 --> 59:00.958
Thank you.
- See you.  - Thank you.

59:00.993 --> 59:02.334
Thank you.

59:03.854 --> 59:06.326
What was that?
- She just called me cute!

59:06.454 --> 59:07.712
She said you were cute?
- Yes.

59:07.950 --> 59:11.185
I guess my mom's not the only
one who thinks that. - Guess not.

59:13.052 --> 59:15.625
What is that crap on
your nose? - It's sweat.

59:17.115 --> 59:18.736
BOWLING

59:18.771 --> 59:22.045
Oh! Wait! My shoes.
Okay, I'll be right back.

59:22.085 --> 59:23.896
Don't get kidnapped.
- Okay.

59:27.019 --> 59:29.427
Thank you. Those please.

59:31.117 --> 59:33.616
Nice work.
- I aim to please.

59:37.918 --> 59:41.520
Okay, remember...
Eye contact and confidence.

59:41.585 --> 59:45.315
Come on, take that off.
You can do it.  Now we are talking.

59:45.351 --> 59:47.518
Look at that,
you're a Greek god.

59:47.819 --> 59:49.711
Abs of steel.
- Yeah.

59:49.752 --> 59:51.368
Yeah.
- Is my nose sweating?

59:52.452 --> 59:55.675
Yeah, little bit. But, it will wash
out when you get in the water.

59:55.785 --> 59:58.812
Okay. - Okay, come on.
Go get her. You can do this.

59:58.850 --> 01:00:00.498
Come on, Stalker.

01:00:24.615 --> 01:00:27.302
Do you need a towel?
- No, no, no.

01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:32.579
Eye contact, eye contact!

01:00:34.982 --> 01:00:37.578
Hi, Arden.
- Hi, Hugo.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.952
You know my name?
- Yeah, I know your name.

01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:45.978
You said you know by
mean H-I, not H-I-G-H.

01:00:46.818 --> 01:00:47.874
Okay.

01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:52.945
<i>Let's go ladies, practice is over.
Got to clear the pool area.</i>

01:00:53.711 --> 01:00:54.442
<i>Hurry up.</i>

01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:00.812
Yes!

01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:03.477
Yes!

01:01:03.518 --> 01:01:06.845
Yes, yes, yes!

01:01:06.884 --> 01:01:08.612
Yes?
- Yes!

01:01:08.652 --> 01:01:11.347
Yes? - She invited
me to her party!

01:01:13.983 --> 01:01:15.778
She invited me to her party!

01:01:19.553 --> 01:01:22.862
We did it!
Exactly what I needed!

01:01:22.897 --> 01:01:25.876
Yes! - Yes! - Do you see
my nephew happy?  - Yes!

01:01:26.685 --> 01:01:28.615
Yeah man, you got it!

01:01:35.383 --> 01:01:37.944
I heard about the
Pasadena project. - Yeah.

01:01:37.982 --> 01:01:41.344
Listen, I have some ideas.
I know it's a long shot, but

01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:44.395
please take a look.
I'd love a chance.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.835
And I promise that I'd treat
like my own child.

01:01:52.184 --> 01:01:55.459
Hey mom. The 101
was wide open.

01:01:57.615 --> 01:02:00.450
It's okay. I just let him drive
from around the block.

01:02:02.517 --> 01:02:05.121
Don't worry, I'm not one of those
people concerned about children.

01:02:06.553 --> 01:02:10.521
Hugo, that's wonderful.
A party with other kids.

01:02:10.614 --> 01:02:13.803
So can I go? - Of course,
I'll take you.  It'll be great.

01:02:14.709 --> 01:02:15.597
Ou, ou, ou, ou!

01:02:16.418 --> 01:02:19.556
Sara, you work so hard.
I will take him.

01:02:19.817 --> 01:02:23.226
Are you kidding me? I can't wait
to see all his new friends.

01:02:23.517 --> 01:02:26.869
Plus, we could see the big mansion
of the grandmother, right?

01:02:26.904 --> 01:02:31.338
Hey, no offense, but I think Hugo
would mush rather go with me.

01:02:31.383 --> 01:02:34.484
I mean, look at you.
Look at me.

01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:37.363
Look at you.
- Maximo, Maximo...

01:02:37.514 --> 01:02:40.363
The words should sound
right in your head

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:43.459
before they leave the lips
in your stupid face.

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:46.192
I don't care who brings me.
I'm just excited to go.

01:02:46.227 --> 01:02:47.526
I'm bringing you, honey.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.566
I'm sure uncle Maximo has better
things to do on a Saturday. - Okay.

01:03:01.515 --> 01:03:04.959
James. - Shit!
You scared me!

01:03:04.994 --> 01:03:09.094
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's Maximo, Sara's brother.

01:03:09.129 --> 01:03:10.902
Yeah, why are you
hiding in my garbage?

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:13.686
We need to talk.
It's about Sara.

01:03:14.016 --> 01:03:16.872
My God, what happened?
- It's not what happened,

01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:19.057
it's what hasn't happened.

01:03:19.682 --> 01:03:21.510
I don't understand.
What do you mean? - James,

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:25.915
I'm not saying I get it,
but she likes you.

01:03:27.648 --> 01:03:28.691
Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.050
Hey, I have an idea.

01:03:33.815 --> 01:03:36.298
Take her out on Saturday.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:39.939
Saturday? - Don't you
think  you waited long enough?

01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:42.925
Door.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:53.410
Please don't bother yourself.
You just keep doing nothing there

01:03:53.449 --> 01:03:57.183
while I cook and I open the
door, and whatever else you need.

01:03:57.218 --> 01:04:00.597
Hi.
- Hi, James.  - Hi

01:04:00.715 --> 01:04:06.047
Is it the door again? I'll go
get my tools. - No, no, no. Actually it's...

01:04:07.513 --> 01:04:09.037
It's...

01:04:09.515 --> 01:04:10.718
It's my sink.

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.760
I was just kidding
about my sink.

01:04:17.749 --> 01:04:21.014
Funny.
- So, do you need something?

01:04:21.081 --> 01:04:23.838
Or did you just come here
to tell the sink joke?

01:04:23.873 --> 01:04:27.351
No, no, no. Actually, I didn't.
I mean, I did, but I...

01:04:27.386 --> 01:04:31.262
I came here to ask you if you're free
on Saturday and if you wanted to...

01:04:33.547 --> 01:04:35.625
If you wanted to come out
on a date with me.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.761
What?

01:04:43.414 --> 01:04:44.833
I don't know.

01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:48.365
Okay.
- Mom, are you okay?

01:04:48.913 --> 01:04:53.393
You wanna think about it?
- I don't know.  - She's acting weird.

01:04:53.428 --> 01:04:55.908
Maybe? - Yeah, she'll just think
about it and get back to you.

01:04:55.949 --> 01:04:58.777
Okay, fine. But, you know
let me know either way.

01:04:59.748 --> 01:05:02.500
I told you.
- This guy likes you.

01:05:02.513 --> 01:05:05.852
I don't want to talk about it.
- Hey!  - I'm going to my room.

01:05:06.015 --> 01:05:07.781
Hey!
- Finish the dinner.

01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:18.775
Don't come in.

01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:26.403
I'm sleeping.
- Hugo is asleep now.

01:05:27.887 --> 01:05:30.661
Why did you act
so weird? What's wrong?

01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:34.855
What do you think
is wrong? I'm rusty.

01:05:34.893 --> 01:05:37.959
I don't feel ready
to go out with anyone.

01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:40.677
When was the last time?

01:05:43.485 --> 01:05:47.323
5 years ago. - I mean,
when was  the last time you...

01:05:47.363 --> 01:05:48.363
5 years.

01:05:51.075 --> 01:05:54.021
Seriously?
- Thant's enough!

01:05:55.705 --> 01:05:58.474
Are you serious?
- <i>Si. Okay?</i>

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:00.362
Stop laughing.

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:03.635
The bakery has been
closed for some time.

01:06:03.837 --> 01:06:07.192
Your pastry is going to go stale.
- You're such a jerk.

01:06:07.882 --> 01:06:09.865
My God, what are
you waiting for?

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:12.891
I don't know.

01:06:14.263 --> 01:06:16.099
You like this little gringo?

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:21.300
You like the gringo!

01:06:23.938 --> 01:06:25.493
So go, then!

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.044
I'm afraid.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:34.944
You know what I do
when I'm afraid? - Pray?

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:37.231
Drink.

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:54.296
My God, leave my bakery alone.
Don't talk to me about my bakery.

01:06:54.342 --> 01:06:55.971
No, but seriously...

01:06:56.009 --> 01:06:58.559
I don't know how
you've managed to go on,

01:06:58.595 --> 01:07:02.515
in spite of all your suffering,

01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:04.187
to keep going, to always
move forward...

01:07:05.977 --> 01:07:09.178
I can because of Hugo.
- Hugo, how?

01:07:10.731 --> 01:07:14.321
When my husband died,

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.608
there were days
when I couldn't even breathe.

01:07:19.105 --> 01:07:22.655
But, how do you explain to a small
child that he has to take care of himself,

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.410
because his mom wants to
lock herself in her room and cry?

01:07:26.162 --> 01:07:27.782
You can't.

01:07:31.458 --> 01:07:36.468
But I have a trick for when
I'm very sad to lift me up.

01:07:36.588 --> 01:07:38.354
Anti-depressants?
- No.

01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:40.162
No, look...

01:07:41.592 --> 01:07:45.762
I take any sad song,

01:07:45.805 --> 01:07:49.291
and transform it into a salsa.
- A sad song?

01:07:50.559 --> 01:07:53.310
What about The Sad One?
Let's go.

01:07:59.025 --> 01:08:00.655
You're stepping on me!

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.650
Come on. Let's go!
The Sad One!

01:08:05.197 --> 01:08:06.197
Come on!

01:08:16.624 --> 01:08:18.254
I'm falling asleep
this isn't a salsa.

01:09:21.045 --> 01:09:23.973
Mom. Mom!

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.631
Hugo!
Did we wake you up?

01:09:29.446 --> 01:09:33.144
Yes. You're singing very loudly
and bumping into things.

01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:36.066
Go to sleep. Both of you.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:39.273
Okay.

01:09:45.497 --> 01:09:48.877
You see? You're not rusty,
all you need to

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.115
is relax and have
fun, that's all!

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:57.173
You honestly don't mind
taking him to the party? - No.

01:09:57.676 --> 01:10:00.099
It would be the greatest
honor of my life.

01:10:01.136 --> 01:10:04.293
Let's go! Come on!
- Send him a text.

01:10:10.312 --> 01:10:13.772
That's my sister!
That's my sister! - Enough!

01:10:41.043 --> 01:10:42.037
Hugo.

01:10:45.611 --> 01:10:47.508
You have no room to judge.

01:10:53.976 --> 01:10:55.537
Sorry for the spill.

01:11:07.111 --> 01:11:09.061
What the hell
happened to me?

01:11:12.678 --> 01:11:15.909
Look what the cat dragged in!
- Pay day.  - Oh, great!

01:11:16.677 --> 01:11:17.399
Thank you.

01:11:20.808 --> 01:11:22.270
Hey, where's the rest of it?

01:11:23.442 --> 01:11:25.512
Try feeding 50 cats
on that kind of money.

01:11:26.111 --> 01:11:28.137
It's meow-trageous!

01:11:32.697 --> 01:11:33.818

01:11:43.036 --> 01:11:43.938

01:11:56.543 --> 01:11:57.670
Give me the works.

01:12:24.476 --> 01:12:25.604
Sorry.

01:12:47.576 --> 01:12:48.569
Hey.

01:12:50.875 --> 01:12:53.504
Behold the glory
of God's creation.

01:12:53.961 --> 01:12:57.929
Did you dye your hair?
- All of it.

01:12:58.215 --> 01:13:01.755
I gave myself a little makeover.
- Maybe next time,  they can makeover your brain.

01:13:02.469 --> 01:13:05.385
I know perfectly well...
I look very good.

01:13:06.431 --> 01:13:07.481
Very good.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:13.550
I love you, stupid face.
- I love you too, little sister.

01:13:20.076 --> 01:13:22.304
What are you telling
your dad tonight?

01:13:22.345 --> 01:13:25.185
Just that I'm excited
to go to Arden's party.

01:13:25.476 --> 01:13:28.510
And that I'm glad
you're going with me.

01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:33.519
I patched it up for you.

01:13:34.442 --> 01:13:36.149
So you can sleep better.

01:13:41.909 --> 01:13:43.570
Give me a
piece of paper, Hugo.

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:47.917
I wanna write a
letter too. - To who?

01:13:49.942 --> 01:13:50.868
My dad.

01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:55.302
I wanna tell him about
his amazing grandson.

01:13:57.673 --> 01:14:00.164
Can we do this
every night? - Sure.

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:04.462
It could be our thing.
Hey, pull my finger.

01:14:05.842 --> 01:14:08.435
Too late.
- Oh. - Sorry.

01:14:19.608 --> 01:14:21.600
Today's the party!
- Really?

01:14:21.942 --> 01:14:23.430
I haven't been
thinking about it.

01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:25.733
Mommy's taking me
to get a hair cut.

01:14:26.108 --> 01:14:29.437
Tell him not too short.
You don't have the ears for it.

01:14:29.474 --> 01:14:30.679
Why don't you stop talking.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.898
You don't have the mouth
for it. Hugo, come here.

01:14:33.642 --> 01:14:34.857
Hey!

01:14:35.675 --> 01:14:39.433
I made the wall!
Wow, what happened?

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.173
It's been kind of nice
having you here.

01:14:44.808 --> 01:14:50.005
Right? - It's been okay.
- Just okay? - Okay, okay...

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.877
Been very nice having you here,
uncle Maximo. - Now we're talking.

01:14:54.994 --> 01:14:56.628
Bye. - See you,
uncle Maximo.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:59.875
Don't sprinkle the toilet.
- I'll do my best.

01:15:07.074 --> 01:15:08.828
God!

01:15:10.675 --> 01:15:11.667
Now what?

01:15:20.442 --> 01:15:22.502
Hey. Guys!

01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:24.519
I was just looking for you.

01:15:25.476 --> 01:15:27.618
Coffee?
- Coffee.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:30.769
Money! - We're not
here for coffee, man!

01:15:30.807 --> 01:15:33.568
Money!
- That's what we want!

01:15:33.607 --> 01:15:37.535
That's why we are here! We don't
even like coffee! - Get the money!

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:41.079
Yeah. Money.
I don't exactly have it.

01:15:41.342 --> 01:15:43.240
What do you mean, exactly?

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:46.295
Means he doesn't have it.

01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:48.499
Well, then why don't
just say you don't have it.

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:50.764
Why even say
the word exactly at all?

01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:54.468
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.
- Hey, you got a real nice place here.

01:15:54.506 --> 01:15:57.797
By nice place, I mean a total dump.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:15:57.839 --> 01:15:59.801
People just say what
they mean, it's confusing.

01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:04.126
Guys, this is my sister's place, please.
- You know what your problem is?

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.342
You don't have any
respect for money man!

01:16:06.572 --> 01:16:09.198
Money doesn't grow on trees.
- No, it doesn't.

01:16:09.233 --> 01:16:12.500
It would be cool if it did.
- Nikki, Nikki! Please!

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:15.789
I'm just backing up your point.
You could literally rake it up.

01:16:15.824 --> 01:16:18.501
What're you doing? - Hey...
- Totally forgot what I was talking about.

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:21.508
What if we took stuff of yours, sir?
- Okay, okay. That's a good point.

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.890
What if we barged in and
started taking stuff?

01:16:23.972 --> 01:16:27.066
What if I took this thing? - No, please...
- I don't even know what it is.

01:16:27.107 --> 01:16:29.335
What about this? What
if I took this? - No, no!

01:16:29.374 --> 01:16:32.789
No, no, not that! That's
my nephew's. That's important.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:35.649
This is important to you? - Yeah.
- Then, probably don't want me to have it then?

01:16:36.405 --> 01:16:37.600
Hey, no,
don't do that please.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.824
No, don't do that please.
Okay, okay...

01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:43.179
What do you like?
Sports cars? Helicopters?

01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:47.357
Rolex watches? I promise I am good
for the money and so much more.

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:49.303
I don't need a Rolex, bro.

01:16:49.573 --> 01:16:51.382
You know something?
- What?

01:16:56.339 --> 01:16:59.315
You seem like a very
sincere guy. - I am.

01:17:00.005 --> 01:17:02.873
But, I don't believe anything
that you say you're gonna do.

01:17:02.938 --> 01:17:05.388
So give us our money,
you can have your camera back.

01:17:05.506 --> 01:17:06.869
It's that simple.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.733
Hey, please,
please, please. Hey.

01:17:09.738 --> 01:17:13.158
Hey! Have a real nice day.

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:17.235
And by that I mean,
do not have a real nice day.

01:17:20.838 --> 01:17:25.209
I get it. Sometimes its funny to
not say exactly what you mean.

01:17:25.244 --> 01:17:27.219
Not the camera,
hey, the camera.

01:17:36.907 --> 01:17:39.868
<i>Uncle Maximo, we're home.
Are you ready?</i>

01:17:43.504 --> 01:17:44.497
Almost.

01:18:04.871 --> 01:18:09.718
Wow! We look the same.
- Yep. Maximo. Minimo.

01:18:12.072 --> 01:18:15.009
Wow, mom!
You look pretty.

01:18:15.075 --> 01:18:19.566
<i>And you're so guapo.</i>
- That dress is really tight on you.

01:18:19.602 --> 01:18:23.202
You mean, I look fat? - No,
no, no. In a good way, I mean.

01:18:23.237 --> 01:18:25.899
Because you can see all the
body parts in your body.

01:18:25.971 --> 01:18:28.666
I'm gonna take...
- No! No, no, no.

01:18:28.707 --> 01:18:31.898
Let's make some
magic happen. - Yeah!

01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:35.047
Arden, here we come.

01:18:46.056 --> 01:18:48.314
<font color=#00FF00><b>Valet Parking
Please Pull Forward</b></font>

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:26.498
Wow! Look at this place!

01:19:26.537 --> 01:19:29.997
Yep.
This will do just fine.

01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:36.466
There she is.

01:19:38.438 --> 01:19:42.529
Yep.
There she is.

01:19:44.339 --> 01:19:48.696
Hey, Hugo, just remember
everything I taught you, okay?

01:19:48.803 --> 01:19:50.753
Thank you, uncle Maximo.

01:19:57.705 --> 01:20:00.729
Go get her. Go get her,
Latino lover.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.129
Beautiful as your uncle.

01:20:26.504 --> 01:20:29.033
Hello.

01:20:29.069 --> 01:20:32.371
Have we met?
- Only in my dreams.

01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:38.998
Oh, Hugo!

01:20:42.102 --> 01:20:46.592
Did you hurt your leg?
- No baby, I was just walking.

01:20:47.904 --> 01:20:51.497
My nephew is quiet fond
of your grand daughter.

01:20:51.503 --> 01:20:52.939
Really?

01:20:59.668 --> 01:21:02.098
Do I have something on my face?

01:21:02.133 --> 01:21:05.205
Yes. You have my full attention.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:08.276
Okay.
- It's enchanting to meet you.

01:21:08.637 --> 01:21:10.119
Maximo.

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:16.263
Hey baby, what do you say
we like, leave this place.

01:21:16.298 --> 01:21:18.771
What do you mean?
I have a birthday party.

01:21:18.806 --> 01:21:21.259
Drink?
- Allow me, please.

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:25.369
Excuse me... - The lady and I
will have your finest champagne.

01:21:25.404 --> 01:21:27.539
She'll have a Sprite
and I'll have a Coke.

01:21:27.574 --> 01:21:31.205
Something as refreshing
and exciting as she is.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.829
Of course.
- Well...

01:21:33.864 --> 01:21:36.206
Actually, I'll just have
some water. Thanks.

01:21:36.241 --> 01:21:39.568
Women. They never know
what they want. Am I right?

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:42.306
She'll have a Sprite,
like I said. - But, of course.

01:21:43.601 --> 01:21:45.212
I have to go.

01:21:48.668 --> 01:21:52.062
Arden, wait.
- Shall we grab a bite?

01:21:53.869 --> 01:21:55.718
Wait, wait.

01:21:57.969 --> 01:22:00.176
Sorry I was acting so weird.

01:22:01.436 --> 01:22:05.561
Can we start over?
- Is that a planetary watch?

01:22:06.537 --> 01:22:07.874
Yeah.

01:22:11.036 --> 01:22:14.590
Wanna check out the rest
of my party? - Sure.  - Come on.

01:22:18.103 --> 01:22:19.429
Cheers.

01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:23.422
Beautiful party.
- Isn't it?

01:22:23.536 --> 01:22:26.398
Yeah.
- Such a beautiful day.

01:22:26.434 --> 01:22:28.353
Mountains, trains, chickens.

01:22:29.967 --> 01:22:32.916
That's quiet
a mountain of melon balls.

01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:36.381
You know, climbing is
one of my greatest passions.

01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:38.613
In fact,
I'm training for Everest.

01:22:38.648 --> 01:22:41.813
Of course, it's not the
mountain that we conquer,

01:22:42.702 --> 01:22:44.964
but ourselves.
- Sir Edmund Hilary.

01:22:44.999 --> 01:22:47.039
Yes. You climb?

01:22:47.074 --> 01:22:50.062
Once upon a time. But,
not anymore. - Nonsense.

01:22:50.468 --> 01:22:55.223
Beautiful strong woman like yourself
surely has many climbs left in her.

01:22:55.501 --> 01:22:59.168
Not this woman, I'm afraid.
- Give me one good reason.

01:23:01.002 --> 01:23:02.273
Frost bite.

01:23:02.336 --> 01:23:06.209
South face of Everest. Just thinking
about it gives me day tremors.

01:23:06.402 --> 01:23:07.852
I hate climbing.

01:23:09.602 --> 01:23:12.688
You convince me.
I hate it too.

01:23:13.902 --> 01:23:16.700
What I really love,
train travel.

01:23:16.968 --> 01:23:19.703
So classic.
Won't you agree?

01:23:21.902 --> 01:23:24.983
Steam locomotive, 1950.
- You have no arms?

01:23:25.018 --> 01:23:26.906
I was playing on the tracks
and got stuck.

01:23:26.936 --> 01:23:29.934
I'm afraid I haven't much
fondness for trains.

01:23:30.436 --> 01:23:32.495
Now if you'll excuse me
for a moment, please.

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:34.308
Chicken!

01:23:37.101 --> 01:23:40.627
Chicken? - Yes, Chicken!
I'm sure you love fried chicken.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:42.986
Having my limbs
torn from my body,

01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:48.286
helped me to realize just how barbaric
the treatment of chickens is in our country.

01:23:48.321 --> 01:23:50.128
I'm vegetarian.
- Which is why I founded

01:23:50.434 --> 01:23:53.243
The Birch Poultry
Rehabilitation Center.

01:23:53.968 --> 01:23:57.042
Now, if you'll forgive
me a moment, please.

01:24:02.933 --> 01:24:04.361
Hey, hey, hey!

01:24:11.034 --> 01:24:12.494
Chicken.

01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:23.695
Rick?

01:24:27.735 --> 01:24:31.561
Rick. Hey! What are
you doing here?  - I was just...

01:24:31.601 --> 01:24:34.593
Waiting for me to make a fool
of myself in front of Celeste?

01:24:36.835 --> 01:24:40.137
Yes. - All that information
that you gave me was wrong.

01:24:40.434 --> 01:24:43.098
It was.
- How could you do that to me?

01:24:43.133 --> 01:24:45.496
Because, I can't take another
second of Millicent.

01:24:45.531 --> 01:24:48.014
Last night, she made me
dress up as her father.

01:24:48.564 --> 01:24:51.506
What is that about?
- I think it's pretty clear.

01:24:51.732 --> 01:24:54.066
I guess you're right.
- So, leave her.

01:24:54.102 --> 01:24:57.255
Leave her? And end up like you
with nothing?

01:24:58.001 --> 01:25:01.841
Look, it's survival of the fittest.
Come on, bro, you know the game.

01:25:02.566 --> 01:25:03.826
No hard feelings.

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:08.566
Hey, Rick...
Hey, Rick... where you going?

01:25:09.634 --> 01:25:10.695
Rick...

01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:21.330
I believe they're playing
our song. May I?

01:25:21.801 --> 01:25:25.068
I'm sorry, do I know you?
- I'm Rick Parsons.

01:25:25.103 --> 01:25:26.189
Hi.
- May I cut in?

01:25:26.224 --> 01:25:28.295
No, I don't think that's a
good idea. - I saw her first.

01:25:28.332 --> 01:25:31.893
Well, I was aware of her first.
- I don't care. - Let it go!

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.362
You can't...

01:25:44.469 --> 01:25:45.730
How do I...

01:25:48.464 --> 01:25:49.525
Sorry.

01:25:50.967 --> 01:25:54.960
Sorry. - My liege...
- Get out! - Yes.

01:25:57.732 --> 01:25:59.694
You pulled her arm?
- No, you pulled her arm.

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:08.324
You were my best friend.

01:26:08.965 --> 01:26:10.581
Get off me!

01:26:26.067 --> 01:26:27.426
They're fighting.

01:26:32.633 --> 01:26:33.927
Hey, guys,

01:26:35.031 --> 01:26:38.825
it's a kid's birthday party...
- You betrayed me.

01:26:38.866 --> 01:26:42.269
It was just business.
It wasn't personal.

01:26:45.399 --> 01:26:49.085
You knew how much I needed this.
- You knew how desperate I was.

01:26:49.098 --> 01:26:51.061
Celeste was my way out.

01:26:51.096 --> 01:26:53.329
You think I'll spend the rest
of my life

01:26:53.365 --> 01:26:56.591
living with my sister and nephew
in their crappy little apartment?

01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:59.854
I thought you said
you liked living with us.

01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:02.830
Hugo, no...

01:27:02.998 --> 01:27:05.245
No, I mean... yes.

01:27:05.632 --> 01:27:07.720
I do. I do very much.

01:27:08.631 --> 01:27:11.871
So you were using me to get
Arden's grand mother. Right?

01:27:11.906 --> 01:27:14.575
No, no, no, I was helping you.
- Please don't lie.  - I swear...

01:27:14.632 --> 01:27:18.912
Okay... a little bit. I mean,
I sort of used you.

01:27:18.947 --> 01:27:21.839
But, it wasn't really about you.
It was more about me

01:27:22.398 --> 01:27:25.607
and in order to help me
I wanted to help you.

01:27:26.599 --> 01:27:28.534
My God, I...

01:27:28.569 --> 01:27:32.081
You know, that sounds
worse than it is.

01:27:32.116 --> 01:27:35.571
I thought you were
helping me because you liked me.

01:27:35.606 --> 01:27:38.745
Sorry, I'm sorry. - I don't want
you sleeping in my bed anymore.

01:27:39.566 --> 01:27:42.242
I don't want you to stay
in my house anymore.

01:27:45.399 --> 01:27:46.760
Oh, my God.

01:27:52.665 --> 01:27:55.410
Overdressed?
- Absolutely not. No.

01:27:55.698 --> 01:27:58.308
I think everybody at
the game is underdressed.

01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:00.958
I think you really
classed the whole place up.

01:28:00.999 --> 01:28:03.696
They should've paid you
to come to the game.

01:28:04.831 --> 01:28:07.144
I'm sorry. It's my son.

01:28:07.996 --> 01:28:09.176
Hi, sweetie.

01:28:11.665 --> 01:28:12.725
What?

01:28:21.267 --> 01:28:24.338
Sorry, I forgot the code.
Is Hugo here?

01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:28.324
Thanks to god, no thanks to you.
- Can I speak with him?

01:28:28.398 --> 01:28:31.869
No. - Please?
Just let me explain.

01:28:32.026 --> 01:28:35.158
How do you explain to a child
who opened his heart to you

01:28:35.193 --> 01:28:36.564
that you were only using him

01:28:36.599 --> 01:28:39.386
to seduce the grandmother
of the girl he likes?

01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:42.705
I can't believe that I was
stupid enough

01:28:43.036 --> 01:28:46.100
to let you humiliate him
like that. - I'm sorry, okay?

01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:49.739
Where is Hugo's camera?

01:28:54.088 --> 01:28:56.021
I promise I'll get it back to you.

01:28:56.966 --> 01:29:00.528
So, you were the one who
stole it. - No, I didn't steal it.

01:29:01.032 --> 01:29:05.014
No, Sara, hey!
Don't kick me out, look...

01:29:05.557 --> 01:29:09.356
We're family!
- No. You're not family.

01:29:09.769 --> 01:29:13.269
You're nothing more than
a lazy 46 year old freeloader

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.188
who doesn't think of anyone but
himself. You didn't just steal his camera.

01:29:17.276 --> 01:29:20.076
You stole his hopes.
You stole his dreams.

01:29:20.487 --> 01:29:22.054
But it ends now.

01:29:23.532 --> 01:29:26.287
You will never use me
or Hugo again, understood?

01:29:29.704 --> 01:29:31.936
I'm 39.
- What?

01:29:32.123 --> 01:29:34.995
You said I'm 46, but I'm 39.

01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:38.196
No, you're not. - Of course, I am.
- No, you're not. - I am.

01:29:38.378 --> 01:29:42.238
But I'm 42. - So what?
- You're my older brother!

01:29:43.217 --> 01:29:44.917
I don't know what to tell you.

01:29:48.346 --> 01:29:49.909
You know what?

01:29:50.806 --> 01:29:52.966
I hope you grow up one day.

01:29:53.809 --> 01:29:55.765
But it won't be in my house.

01:29:58.439 --> 01:30:00.067
Okay, I'm 40.

01:30:01.358 --> 01:30:03.069
Okay, 41.

01:30:03.985 --> 01:30:05.670
We're twins!

01:30:06.464 --> 01:30:07.625
Okay?

01:30:37.631 --> 01:30:40.503
You don't have to sing,
please. - Say your name.

01:30:42.363 --> 01:30:43.625
Say your name.

01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:46.512
Maximo.

01:30:51.595 --> 01:30:55.017
Cindy's home.
- Thank for letting me stay.

01:30:58.861 --> 01:31:00.062
Watch your back.

01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:06.432
We got you some
nice hot tea.

01:31:06.467 --> 01:31:07.825
I think I got all the hairs out.

01:31:07.864 --> 01:31:10.768
And you can stay here
as long as you like.

01:31:11.995 --> 01:31:14.703
I'm sure you'll figure out
a way to pay me back.

01:31:17.994 --> 01:31:19.488
I get it.

01:31:30.462 --> 01:31:33.290
Eye contact.
Don't lose eye contact.

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:42.142
What are you doing? - I'm
about to pay you back. - What?

01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:44.454
God!

01:31:46.696 --> 01:31:48.992
No, no, stop, stop.
Please stop.

01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:51.274
Isn't this what
you want? - No.

01:31:51.562 --> 01:31:55.930
God, no. Button up,
just put that away.

01:31:56.361 --> 01:31:59.779
You're not attracted
to me? - No.  - Really?

01:31:59.829 --> 01:32:01.083
Not at all.

01:32:01.329 --> 01:32:05.405
No, I'm attracted to like
really good looking guys.

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.920
Guys with like great faces,

01:32:07.926 --> 01:32:10.956
great bodies, who are muscular,

01:32:10.996 --> 01:32:14.124
handsome and younger,
much younger than you.

01:32:14.159 --> 01:32:17.704
And tall, a lot taller.
But, that's just me.

01:32:18.428 --> 01:32:21.144
Then, why did you
give me the job?

01:32:22.729 --> 01:32:24.824
I think I'm just drawn
to helping

01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:27.935
less fortunate, damaged,

01:32:28.095 --> 01:32:33.031
sad, sad, sad, sad creatures.

01:32:33.795 --> 01:32:35.857
Why do you think
I have so many cats?

01:32:36.528 --> 01:32:38.755
They need me,
but I need them.

01:32:40.365 --> 01:32:42.334
But, they hurt you
over and over again.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:45.870
This guy, right? I know.

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:50.373
I mean, just because they hurt me
doesn't mean they don't love me.

01:32:51.429 --> 01:32:53.199
I take care of them

01:32:53.762 --> 01:32:56.072
and I don't expect
anything in return.

01:32:57.395 --> 01:32:59.058
These cats are my family.

01:33:00.927 --> 01:33:03.444
I had a chance to be
part of a family.

01:33:04.694 --> 01:33:06.333
I ruined it.

01:33:08.761 --> 01:33:10.821
I don't think you ruined it.

01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:14.399
Because, it's never too late
to make it right.

01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:18.928
You've cat to do
what you cat to do.

01:33:22.328 --> 01:33:24.568
I've never seen
that one before.

01:33:25.362 --> 01:33:28.623
Well, you'd be happy to know
that I lost everything.

01:33:30.028 --> 01:33:33.495
Millicent found out about Celeste's
party, she kicked me out.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.202
You got a sister you
can stay with? - No.

01:33:41.726 --> 01:33:44.038
I never should have gone
behind your back like that.

01:33:45.395 --> 01:33:47.452
Wish there was something
I could do to make it up to you.

01:33:48.695 --> 01:33:50.268
There is something.

01:33:52.093 --> 01:33:54.892
That's your idea face.
- Yep.

01:33:56.026 --> 01:33:57.449
This is it.

01:33:58.996 --> 01:34:02.152
So, when's the kid's science
fair again? - It's in three hours.

01:34:02.894 --> 01:34:05.299
You get in there and get the camera.
I'll keep them distracted over here.

01:34:06.661 --> 01:34:08.994
Police.

01:34:10.362 --> 01:34:11.677
Police from the neighborhood.

01:34:15.561 --> 01:34:18.246
Can I help you, officer?
Here for the tiny motorcycle?

01:34:18.281 --> 01:34:19.822
He's not here
for your stupid bike.

01:34:20.528 --> 01:34:21.766
You here for the bike?

01:34:22.361 --> 01:34:24.684
No sir, I'm not here for the vehicle.
There's a neighborhood gas leak,

01:34:25.661 --> 01:34:27.845
evacuate the premises.

01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:30.957
Gas leak? I didn't even know
we had gas.

01:34:31.093 --> 01:34:32.989
Situation is clear, Larry.

01:34:33.428 --> 01:34:36.037
Yes, sir, Mr. Neighborhood
Police Officer.

01:34:36.062 --> 01:34:39.318
I'm gonna fix the... I'm closing
the door because the gas is...

01:34:39.528 --> 01:34:43.469
leaking here. - I didn't smell
any gas.  - I don't smell anything.

01:34:43.494 --> 01:34:46.693
You wouldn't. That's what makes
the danger so dangerous.

01:34:51.627 --> 01:34:54.782
Excuse me, officer?
-What kind of handcuffs are those?

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.320
Police handcuffs.
- Are they furry?

01:35:02.593 --> 01:35:04.977
There had been some local perps,

01:35:05.012 --> 01:35:07.536
who have been having an
allergic reaction to the metal.

01:35:10.528 --> 01:35:12.744
Now, we coat it
in synthetic material,

01:35:12.959 --> 01:35:16.430
health is on the uprise,
crime is on the down rise.

01:35:16.827 --> 01:35:19.376
But, I wouldn't worry your
pretty head over that, ma'am.

01:35:19.411 --> 01:35:21.487
I don't think we need it in
this investigation. - Ma'am?  - Ma'am?

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:27.027
Is this an investigation?
I thought this was a gas leak?

01:35:27.359 --> 01:35:30.407
Investigation of a gas leak.

01:35:30.442 --> 01:35:35.272
And shut up! I'm a police officer,
I want this crime scene secured.

01:35:35.327 --> 01:35:38.440
It's not a crime scene...
- Shut up!

01:35:44.658 --> 01:35:46.086
Got you!

01:35:51.327 --> 01:35:54.240
Take it easy, alright. You said
investigation - No! You take it easy.

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:57.370
Or I'll shoot you!
- You're not shooting anybody.

01:35:57.405 --> 01:35:59.691
I'll shoot you in the Lorax!

01:35:59.726 --> 01:36:01.676
That's not a thing, officer.
- It's a children's book.

01:36:01.759 --> 01:36:04.669
You sussing me boy?
You sussing me?

01:36:04.704 --> 01:36:07.620
I am a police officer
of the law.

01:36:07.793 --> 01:36:09.102
I don't think you are.

01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:14.563
Officer George Clooney
from the 69th precinct.

01:36:15.526 --> 01:36:18.169
Don't make me use this.
- I won't.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.211
Let it go.
- We've been compromised!

01:36:23.592 --> 01:36:25.245
Ride like the wind.

01:36:34.058 --> 01:36:36.222
Hey, sloucher jerk!

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:41.404
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:36:41.827 --> 01:36:43.340
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:36:44.825 --> 01:36:45.922
Not in the face.

01:36:56.358 --> 01:36:57.553
Hugo.

01:36:59.659 --> 01:37:02.884
Hugo.
Hey, Hugo.

01:37:03.492 --> 01:37:07.486
Hugo.
Hugo. Hey!

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.526
Here's Hugo's camera.

01:37:09.541 --> 01:37:12.851
If we go now, we can still
make the science fair!

01:37:12.877 --> 01:37:15.524
The fair was yesterday.
Hugo missed it.

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.254
No! He told me Sunday at 1!

01:37:18.289 --> 01:37:20.424
Today is Monday.
You're too late.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.139
No, it's never too late!
- This time it is.

01:37:26.174 --> 01:37:28.232
24 hours late to be exact.

01:37:29.017 --> 01:37:30.986
Thanks for the camera.

01:38:36.023 --> 01:38:38.429
All I wanted to do
was impress her.

01:38:38.923 --> 01:38:44.060
Instead, I was humiliated.
- I am sorry, honey.

01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:48.399
You want me to
walk you in? - No, I don't.

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:54.624
You can't live your life afraid
something bad will happen,

01:38:55.792 --> 01:38:58.193
because then, you've
really never lived.

01:38:59.825 --> 01:39:03.358
Where did you hear that?
- Uncle Maximo.

01:39:13.424 --> 01:39:15.967
Hi, Arden.
- Hugo.

01:39:16.657 --> 01:39:18.413
I'm so glad to see you.

01:39:18.892 --> 01:39:22.659
You are? - Yeah.
- I thought you were mad at me.

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:25.915
No. My grandma and I know
you did nothing wrong.

01:39:28.023 --> 01:39:28.720
Good.

01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:31.317
I was worried that
your grandma would be

01:39:31.690 --> 01:39:33.674
up in arms about
us being friends.

01:39:35.758 --> 01:39:39.684
Get it? Up in arms.
Up in arms. Get it?

01:39:39.725 --> 01:39:40.702
Hugo, that's not funny.

01:39:42.057 --> 01:39:43.433
That's just offensive.

01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:48.945
I didn't mean it like that.
- I'm joking.

01:39:49.425 --> 01:39:52.218
I'm funny too, you know.
- Wow, you are funny!

01:39:55.056 --> 01:39:57.060
I got your letter.
- My letter?

01:39:57.489 --> 01:40:01.191
No one's ever written me an
actual on real paper before.

01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:05.077
Really?
- And my answer is yes.

01:40:05.925 --> 01:40:09.844
Well, that's great!

01:40:10.622 --> 01:40:12.356
To what question again,
I'm sorry...

01:40:12.723 --> 01:40:15.171
I'd love to launch the weather
balloon with you, silly.

01:40:15.857 --> 01:40:18.358
Yeah, right,
my weather balloon.

01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:21.535
I forgot about that.
How could I forget about that.

01:40:23.554 --> 01:40:24.735
Can I see that for a sec.

01:40:24.955 --> 01:40:27.596
I just want to see if I got
all my punctuations right.

01:40:27.923 --> 01:40:31.374
Is that okay. - As long as
you give it back. - Thank you.

01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:38.549
<i>"Dearest Arden,</i>

01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:40.417
<i>I am sorry if I caused
you any pain.</i>

01:40:40.890 --> 01:40:43.023
<i>It was the last thing
I wanted to do.</i>

01:40:46.657 --> 01:40:48.818
<i>You are more important
to me than you know.</i>

01:40:49.588 --> 01:40:52.163
Two, one... Yes go!

01:40:52.623 --> 01:40:55.554
<i>I always wished we could
be friends.</i> - There it goes.

01:40:58.456 --> 01:41:00.561
<i>But, you don't get what
you wish for,</i>

01:41:01.854 --> 01:41:03.593
<i>you get what you work for.</i>

01:41:09.755 --> 01:41:11.921
<i>Sometimes love can be scary.</i>

01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:18.755
Alright, moment of truth,
here we go.

01:41:21.556 --> 01:41:22.549
I think...

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.028
<i>Sometimes love
can be surprising.</i>

01:41:44.956 --> 01:41:47.115
Is this happening?
- I think so.

01:41:55.921 --> 01:41:58.524
<i>Sometimes we hurt
the ones we love.</i>

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:11.851
No! - What the hell is
that?  - I didn't know man.

01:42:15.522 --> 01:42:18.533
<i>But, it's never too late
to make it right.</i>

01:42:37.622 --> 01:42:39.997
<i>Our time on earth is short.</i>

01:42:45.921 --> 01:42:48.127
<i>But, love is forever.</i>

01:42:50.487 --> 01:42:52.860
<i>You make me want to
be a better fifth grader.</i>

01:42:55.822 --> 01:42:58.564
<i>Would you please join me in
launching my weather balloon?</i>

01:42:59.554 --> 01:43:01.373
<i>Yours, Hugo."</i>

01:43:05.855 --> 01:43:09.449
Oh, Sara. - You didn't
get the house in Pasadena,

01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:11.871
they went with someone...
- Let me guess, more experienced.

01:43:12.789 --> 01:43:14.279
Yeah. - Well, you
know what I think?

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:16.051
Good...
- Can I finish?

01:43:17.322 --> 01:43:19.745
I think that I deserve
a shot at my own house.

01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:21.494
And if I'm not given my due,

01:43:21.922 --> 01:43:24.628
I not afraid to go somewhere
else where I am appreciated.

01:43:25.721 --> 01:43:29.101
Okay. Have you finished?
- No, I am not.

01:43:29.756 --> 01:43:31.741
A lesser woman would
have given up already,

01:43:31.988 --> 01:43:33.717
ten years of drawing plans.

01:43:33.888 --> 01:43:36.053
But, I am strong,
I am determined.

01:43:36.389 --> 01:43:38.846
And I know that I will find
my dream job someday.

01:43:38.952 --> 01:43:41.886
Yes, you will. - Yes, I will.
- And that day is today.

01:43:45.089 --> 01:43:46.383
What?

01:43:53.486 --> 01:43:55.047
Okay, Hugo.

01:43:55.087 --> 01:43:57.072
What do you think?
Glasses on or glasses off?

01:43:57.722 --> 01:43:59.403
You look pretty
either way, mommy.

01:43:59.688 --> 01:44:02.355
Baby,
it's a big day today.

01:44:03.056 --> 01:44:05.237
Mommy's a little nervous.

01:44:05.587 --> 01:44:08.919
Well, at least your nose isn't
sweating. - Well, it's a good thing.

01:44:11.721 --> 01:44:14.870
Wow!
A helicopter!

01:44:15.721 --> 01:44:17.996
Oh my Goodness!
Okay...

01:44:19.822 --> 01:44:23.676
You wait here and
I will be... right back.

01:44:23.787 --> 01:44:25.611
Mommy...
- Yeah?

01:44:26.987 --> 01:44:28.299
I am proud of you.

01:44:39.019 --> 01:44:41.382
Mommy's gonna
build a house. - Yes!

01:44:54.887 --> 01:45:00.290
Mrs. Dupont. It is
so nice to meet you.

01:45:00.325 --> 01:45:00.347
Thank you. Thank you
for this opportunity

01:45:00.385 --> 01:45:02.204
I promise that you
wont regret it.

01:45:02.485 --> 01:45:06.148
I certainly hope not. You
come very highly recommended.

01:45:08.387 --> 01:45:09.349
By who?

01:45:13.385 --> 01:45:15.869
Maximo?
- Wow!

01:45:22.325 --> 01:45:25.502
You didn't think I'd be selling
frozen yogurt all my life, did you?

01:45:27.419 --> 01:45:31.651
I usually don't put much stock
in what my man candy says, but

01:45:31.822 --> 01:45:35.066
he showed me your
designs and I loved them.

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.754
You did?

01:45:40.352 --> 01:45:42.906
Thank you.
- Uncle Maximo.

01:45:43.384 --> 01:45:45.641
Uncle Maximo.
- Hey!

01:45:46.819 --> 01:45:50.265
Hugo! - That's my son.
- I missed you so much.

01:45:50.485 --> 01:45:51.603
Missed you too.

01:45:52.785 --> 01:45:54.617
Nice blazer, Uncle Maximo.

01:45:55.552 --> 01:45:57.898
Professor Rojas,
when she's around.

01:45:58.487 --> 01:46:00.076
Such a great view.

01:46:00.652 --> 01:46:03.284
I'm so glad I am rich.
- Yeah, me too.

01:46:03.318 --> 01:46:07.350
Must be nice.
- Hey, don't go too far.

01:46:07.619 --> 01:46:09.037
Or I'll put you in detention.

01:46:09.818 --> 01:46:11.780
Have I been a bad girl?

01:46:20.352 --> 01:46:22.286
Well, I guess Papa was wrong.

01:46:23.053 --> 01:46:26.369
Sometimes you do get what
you wish for. - Are you kidding?

01:46:26.549 --> 01:46:30.418
This woman's a lot of work.
- <i>Ay dios mio.</i>

01:46:30.453 --> 01:46:32.108
Hugo, wanna go for a ride?

01:46:32.144 --> 01:46:35.420
I don't know if momma
will let me. - You know what?

01:46:35.982 --> 01:46:40.466
I think professor Rojas
has earned another chance.

01:46:40.585 --> 01:46:44.025
Yes!
- That's my older sister.

01:46:44.586 --> 01:46:47.104
Stop it! I am
your baby sister!

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.585
Yeah, but you look older.
Honestly.

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:54.286
What can I tell you?
It's true. - Come here, come here.

01:46:54.409 --> 01:46:55.408
Come here.

01:47:00.038 --> 01:47:03.956
Thank you. Thank you! You
helped me make my dream come true.

01:47:07.951 --> 01:47:11.447
You earned it.
You're so talented.

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:13.722
I love you.

01:47:16.137 --> 01:47:17.768
I love you.

01:47:20.685 --> 01:47:23.225
Okay, Hugo, let's go.
Mommy's got work to do.

01:47:23.769 --> 01:47:27.022
Don't call him "Jugo."
His name is Hugo!

01:47:27.057 --> 01:47:29.272
Same thing.
- He's not a juice.

01:47:31.619 --> 01:47:34.953
Up you go.
Come on, co pilot.

01:47:34.988 --> 01:47:38.659
I want the house
to be beautiful. - Me too.

01:47:38.819 --> 01:47:40.091
But eerie.

01:47:41.751 --> 01:47:44.357
Sleek.
Seaside.

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.804
Fever dream.

01:47:50.717 --> 01:47:53.018
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

01:47:56.884 --> 01:47:57.944
Let's fly.

01:48:00.518 --> 01:48:01.511
Bye.

01:48:06.348 --> 01:48:08.610
I didn't know you
could fly a helicopter.

01:48:08.651 --> 01:48:11.709
Of course. All rich
people fly helicopters.

01:48:11.753 --> 01:48:14.180
Can I drive?
- I don't see why not.

01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:15.477
Yes!

01:48:17.850 --> 01:48:19.868
No! No!

01:48:21.551 --> 01:48:24.908
I thought we were in
trouble there. - You got it.

01:48:25.552 --> 01:48:29.132
Hello?
- Who's that?

01:48:29.548 --> 01:48:31.753
It's your mommy.
She wants us to come back now.

01:48:36.819 --> 01:48:37.813
Come on.

01:48:40.516 --> 01:48:41.876
Show me your sexy.

01:48:53.050 --> 01:48:54.544
Camera 1...

01:49:09.883 --> 01:49:12.745
Squeeze your body.
You look like Chaplin.

01:49:12.783 --> 01:49:15.443
You know who
Chaplin is? - No.

01:49:28.483 --> 01:49:32.612
Unhand me, sir.

01:49:44.317 --> 01:49:47.145
Do you want me to see if the
manager's here. She does all hiring.

01:49:47.474 --> 01:49:48.620
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:49:50.383 --> 01:49:52.941
Hello. I am the manager.

01:50:11.315 --> 01:50:13.409
Hey, guys.

01:50:16.682 --> 01:50:19.603
Latin lover.
- Latin lover.
