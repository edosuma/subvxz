00:45.480 --> 00:49.121
Before there was light there were angels.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.324
One moment darkness

00:51.440 --> 00:55.923
the next, heaven was bright
with glorious beings.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.765
It was perfect.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.884
It did not last.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.159
Lucifer revolted against God.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.400
A line was drawn in paradise.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.845
A war began.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.486
Every angel was forced to choose

01:09.800 --> 01:14.442
the holiness of heaven or the chaos
that roiled outside.

01:14.880 --> 01:17.042
One angel refused

01:17.080 --> 01:20.319
believing the only thing worth fighting for

01:20.320 --> 01:23.210
was a force we now call love.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.410
Cast out of heaven

01:25.480 --> 01:28.563
this angel did not fall alone.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.684
Every angel who had yet to choose

01:31.760 --> 01:35.526
fell in a flash of almighty fury.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.202
These are the Fallen.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.528
Exiled from heaven

01:41.840 --> 01:43.524
they wander the earth

01:43.600 --> 01:45.921
banished until the rebel angel

01:46.040 --> 01:49.647
abandons love and takes a side.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.525
That was then.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.044
This is now.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.742
Is that it?

02:28.820 --> 02:29.820
Must be.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.400
Love you.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.760
My baby.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.282
I just wish I knew how to help you.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.846
I'll be fine.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.600
Look here.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.080
It's small.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.131
I wanted you to have something
to open on your birthday.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.480
Thank you.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I love you.

03:37.560 --> 03:38.560
Bye, Dad.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.051
Welcome to Sword and Cross Academy.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.319
For over 75 years
we have served adolescents

04:35.320 --> 04:39.405
who because of social and-or
emotional challenges that they face

04:40.680 --> 04:44.844
have been unable to thrive
in a traditional academic environment.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.325
At Sword and Cross
we combine college preparatory education

04:49.800 --> 04:51.768
cutting edge clinical services

04:52.000 --> 04:54.810
and diverse enrichment
programs that focus on

04:54.960 --> 04:56.530
personal growth.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.126
Where do you want him this time?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.280
Through there.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.885
I'll be right with you.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.486
Including

05:13.400 --> 05:15.159
fencing, swimming

05:15.160 --> 05:18.289
and the use of our world
renowned Fowler Library.

05:18.640 --> 05:24.249
Our founder's philosophy is
based upon the core principles...

05:26.920 --> 05:28.410
Now dump your hazards.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.468
Hazards?

05:30.540 --> 05:33.603
Alcohol. Drugs. Weapons of any type.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.126
Gang related items or clothing.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.251
Music players, tablets,
gaming systems, laptops.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.360
Cell phones.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.961
No no no, I need my phone.

05:45.962 --> 05:48.531
You get ten minutes of phone
privileges once a week.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.324
- You're kidding.
- What's this?

05:50.920 --> 05:52.729
- I don't know, it's a present...
- Hazard.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.650
Haven't got all day, Randy.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.956
I'll be right there. Arriane!

05:55.980 --> 05:59.382
Could you show Lucinda to the dorms?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.206
Sure, I got it.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.847
You can pick your bag up after lunch.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.325
So tell me about your weekend, Cam.
I'm all ears.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.449
- Arriane.
- Luce.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.162
We're going to keep him
on a very short leash.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.322
There's no need
to press charges this time, Bill.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.169
You know we've got this covered.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.606
We'll keep a good eye on him.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.086
You're going to want to stay away from Cam.
Yeah, why's that?

06:24.560 --> 06:25.800
He's trouble.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.245
Not the good kind.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.449
Let me see your schedule.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.689
Good, you're with us.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.491
- Us?
- Prep-track.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.800
We tend to stick together.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.567
Most kids here are psych referrals.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.547
They're lucky to get through the day
without wetting themselves

06:45.548 --> 06:49.226
or attacking a teacher because their
pencils are unevenly sharpened.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.801
Don't be spooked, though.
They keep them separate.

06:51.802 --> 06:55.247
All the serious mental defectives are
up on the third floor.

06:55.760 --> 06:58.684
It's one big pharmapalooza.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.646
This is me. 208.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.720
Where are you?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.240
You're messing with me, right?

07:07.680 --> 07:08.761
You're a psy...

07:11.880 --> 07:13.041
(0K8)'-

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
Hey.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.767
Sorry.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.647
Tell me about your hallucinations.
What do you call them?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.040
Shadows.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
Shadows.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.887
And they started when?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.530
When I was little.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.886
Five or six. I can't remember exactly.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.844
And you still see them?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.367
No. I haven't for a while.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.242
Tell me, Lucinda.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.644
Why do you think you're here

09:20.160 --> 09:21.605
at Sword and Cross'?

09:22.440 --> 09:23.771
Ask the judge.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.481
I've read your file.
I know what the judge thinks.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.003
What I don't understand is your decision.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.845
Doctor Segal says that
on medication, you're stable.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.800
No hallucinations. No paranoia.
No nightmares.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.850
I'm not crazy, you know.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.921
No. Nobody's saying you're crazy.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.845
Everybody's saying that.

09:43.120 --> 09:47.170
Do you understand, that if you take
your prescribed medication you can leave.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.399
Go home. Go back to your old school.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.890
Be with your friends.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.124
I don't like the way they make me feel.

09:55.125 --> 09:59.762
But if you refuse, you need to be here

10:00.680 --> 10:04.082
in a court sanctioned treatment facility,
under supervision.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.044
Even if it means being locked up

10:10.120 --> 10:13.920
I'd rather be me than pretend to be
something I'm not just to fit in.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.887
You have a chance at a normal life.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.691
Poor thing. She has no
idea what she's in for.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.210
Maybe it'll be different this time.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.341
You know something I don't?

10:31.342 --> 10:33.145
It'd just be nice for a change, that's all.

10:33.146 --> 10:34.551
Alright, let's make it interesting.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.999
Twenty to one Luce goes down in flames,
just like always.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.020
I'm in for a hundred.

10:38.021 --> 10:39.021
- Arriane!
- What?

10:39.100 --> 10:40.101
- Gabbe?
- It's cruel.

10:40.102 --> 10:41.331
This isn't a game, Roland.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
Maybe it is.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.241
Here we go again.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.971
The mind is its own place and in itself

11:02.040 --> 11:04.805
can make a Hell of Heaven.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.762
What's that?

11:06.780 --> 11:08.703
Milton. Paradise Lost.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.722
- You're Lucinda Price?
- Yeah.

11:10.723 --> 11:14.042
I'm Miss Sophia.
You're in my Philosophy of Religion class.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.368
- Did you come for your books?
- Mm-hmm.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.605
Pre-calc, English lit, Chemistry,
Religion and History.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.082
Oh, still missing one.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.691
Would you mind? It's in
special collections.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
Sure.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.762
Ah, it's a pleasure to meet you, Luce.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
Thanks.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.360
Hi.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.526
Hey, wait.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.926
You dropped this.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
Shit!

13:37.640 --> 13:38.926
You scared me.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.600
Alright.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.965
You poor thing.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.761
- Jeez.
- Oh, did you fall?

13:57.080 --> 13:58.080
Are you hurt?

13:58.800 --> 14:00.245
- I'm fine.
- No you're not.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.324
You've never been less fine
in your whole nauseating existence.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.169
Coming here was a bad choice.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.960
Listen, if I did something to upset you,
I'm sorry...

14:08.000 --> 14:09.570
You make me sick.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.042
You're nothing.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.529
You bat your lashes and flick your hair and
expect the whole world to come to a stop.

14:14.530 --> 14:15.626
You don't even know me.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.862
I know you're a murdering little psycho.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.199
Hey! Break it up!

14:29.200 --> 14:31.248
Psycho bitch.
You should come with a warning label.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.760
That was quick.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.806
- She...
- Don't tell me she started it.

14:36.807 --> 14:38.159
I'm sure she did.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.242
But that doesn't mean
you have to take the bait.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.726
You're right. I'm sorry.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.161
Fighting is grounds for expulsion.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.683
Which for you would mean
a transfer to the state psych hospital.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.411
Is that what you want?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.280
No.

14:53.680 --> 14:57.605
Since today is your first day and I'm guessing
you've yet to read the code of conduct

14:58.840 --> 15:00.604
I'll just give you yard duty.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.721
And you? You come with me.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.331
You know you're not supposed to be
in here without a pass.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.007
I just, ah...

15:31.040 --> 15:33.247
Oh no no no, that was a joke.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.801
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.200
Oh gosh.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.927
Oh. Not funny?

15:40.240 --> 15:42.402
It's just been a really rough day.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.291
Yeah. Welcome to Sword and Cross.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.243
- This place is...
- Crazy.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.410
I'm Pennyweather Van Syckle-Lockwood.
You can call me Penn.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.248
(0K8)'-

15:53.320 --> 15:56.761
And you are Lucinda Price,
but everyone calls you Luce.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.763
Transferred here from Dover with a 4.2.

15:58.920 --> 15:59.920
Impressive.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.046
How did you know that?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.728
Shoot. Was that stalkery?

16:05.320 --> 16:06.685
A little bit, yeah.

16:06.960 --> 16:07.980
Sorry.

16:07.981 --> 16:11.016
See the thing is, this is a really
small school. Like really, really small.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.279
Like infinitesimally small,
and not a lot happens here.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.484
It's not like Dover, and you're the new
girl and you're smart and you're pretty

16:16.585 --> 16:19.456
so I'm guessing that you're going to be
the centre of a lot of attention

16:19.480 --> 16:21.164
both positive and negative.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.480
Great.

16:24.640 --> 16:25.640
Tell you what.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.247
I'm gonna go, let you do your thing

16:28.280 --> 16:31.279
and then maybe if you're feeling
forgiving you can...

16:31.280 --> 16:34.243
forget the whole me acoosting you
in the bathroom with too much information

16:34.244 --> 16:36.616
when you just want to be alone and
then rambling on and on

16:36.640 --> 16:38.364
because I don't know
know how to stop myself

16:38.365 --> 16:40.316
from talking situation
that's happening right now

16:40.340 --> 16:41.421
and give me another chance?

16:41.440 --> 16:42.521
I'll go now.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.984
- Hey Penn?
- Yeah?

16:44.160 --> 16:47.562
Do you mind showing me back to the dorms?
I'm a little bit lost.

16:47.880 --> 16:48.880
Sure.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.487
Thanks.

17:32.320 --> 17:36.848
What if angels actually
walked among us right now, here on earth?

17:37.520 --> 17:39.921
That's the story of The Fallen.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.804
Angels cast out of heaven

17:41.880 --> 17:45.327
condemned to live
their lives alongside us mere mortals.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.531
Banished, because they
failed to pick a side

17:48.532 --> 17:51.000
in Lucifer's war against Heaven.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.966
Who can tell me
what the war in Heaven was about?

17:54.080 --> 17:55.080
Todd?

17:56.280 --> 17:57.611
Good versus evil?

17:57.880 --> 18:00.042
No, that's too simplistic.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.479
Lucifer was God's favourite.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.925
His brightest light.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.010
What caused him to turn from God?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.179
Anyone?

18:08.180 --> 18:09.830
'Cause his girlfriend dumped him.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.170
What happened to the other angels?

18:16.600 --> 18:20.082
Those that sided with Satan
were banished to Hell.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.602
Only the faithful remained in heaven.

18:23.320 --> 18:27.530
The angels that didn't choose,
they were cast out.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.170
They are the Fallen.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.444
Forced to walk the earth

18:33.680 --> 18:37.321
some of the Fallen
retained their angelic nature

18:37.400 --> 18:41.291
repented and wait for the chance
to return to Heaven.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.239
Others aligned themselves with Lucifer

18:44.240 --> 18:46.811
finding pleasure in mischief and chaos.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.841
But neither group can leave this world

18:51.240 --> 18:53.208
because of one of their own.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.729
The rebel angel.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.446
He rejected both sides of the war.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.719
God and Lucifer alike

19:00.720 --> 19:04.486
all in his pursuit of human love.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.410
The other fallen angels

19:06.411 --> 19:08.209
must remain here on earth

19:08.280 --> 19:13.207
until he chooses a side
in the only war that has ever been waged.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.805
The war we still see every day
raging all around us.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.931
But surely you learned some of this
in Sunday school?

19:21.240 --> 19:23.083
No, I didn't go to church growing up.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
Really?

19:25.120 --> 19:27.009
Yeah, my parents aren't really religious.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.007
So, you were never baptized?

19:30.520 --> 19:32.170
Um, no.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.207
Is it supposed to be over, the war?

19:36.720 --> 19:39.439
I mean, theologically speaking

19:39.440 --> 19:41.005
if the Devil is still alive.

19:41.006 --> 19:43.048
What's to stop him trying
from trying again?

19:43.080 --> 19:44.923
Excellent question.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.088
So, any more takers on that bet?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.283
Yep.

20:06.284 --> 20:07.850
Keep them rolling, Roland.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.846
Luce, you poor thing.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.326
Are you okay?

21:12.320 --> 21:14.846
What is going on here? Is anyone hurt?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.805
No really, I'm fine.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.045
The food is fine.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.766
- Anything?
- Anything, sweetie.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.846
Definitely your orange cinnamon pancakes with
whipped cream with bananas. That sounds...

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
Hey!

21:34.120 --> 21:35.645
What's taking so long? Come on.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
Ineedit.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.839
Mom? Mom?

21:41.840 --> 21:45.481
Allocated time completed.
Allocated time completed.

21:52.280 --> 21:54.931
I just can't believe I have to wait
a whole week to talk to them.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.296
You know, I didn't even
get a chance to say goodbye.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.243
You can have my time on Tuesday.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.443
No.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.805
Yeah, I'm not gonna use it.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.881
I've been here six years.
Everyone I know is here

22:03.920 --> 22:06.446
and everyone I'm interested in
talking to is in this room.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.120
What about your parents?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.651
I've been meaning to ask.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.564
How I ended up here?

22:17.640 --> 22:20.211
You don't have to tell me.
It's not a big deal.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.764
Well after my parents got divorced

22:25.120 --> 22:27.324
neither of them really wanted me around so

22:27.325 --> 22:29.721
they decided that boarding school
was in my best interest.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.481
And as soon as my Morn saw that brochure

22:32.560 --> 22:35.564
the one with the kids riding horses
and swimming and stuff

22:36.840 --> 22:37.862
that was it.

22:37.863 --> 22:41.467
The search was over,
I was enrolled and here I am.

22:41.960 --> 22:46.249
So you're not a kleptomaniac,
manic depressive, anorexic cutter?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.481
No.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.448
My diagnosis is much worse

22:50.520 --> 22:53.524
and, I'm afraid, untreatable.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.724
I have TDP.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.966
TDP?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.849
Tragically Disinterested Parents.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.644
Yeah, my parents suck.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.250
But there's a pool.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.324
But there is a pool.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.489
You've gotta be kidding me.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.130
Don't tell me.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.324
Is Cam in love?

24:01.400 --> 24:03.243
That could make things difficult for you.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.682
Just don't forget who you work for.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.805
Daniel.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.889
I didn't get a chance to
say thanks yesterday.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.400
Don't mention it.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.489
Well thank you anyway.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.476
There's one more thing
I'm a little embarrassed to even ask but...

24:21.500 --> 24:22.706
Well then don't.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.404
Well I've committed now.
I'm just going to go for it.

24:25.405 --> 24:27.368
It's just you seem really familiar to me.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.569
Like I know you from somewhere.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.405
- Is that possible?
- No.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.485
I'd remember you.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.564
Because I keep thinking that...

24:36.600 --> 24:38.568
I've gotta go, alright? I'll see you later.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
Thank you.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.845
Hey new girl. Pretty
eventful first few days.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.650
Already planning your escape?

25:00.720 --> 25:02.688
Yeah, considering it.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.201
You ah, you want some breakfast?

25:07.440 --> 25:10.325
That's tempting,
but I'm actually running late to class.

25:10.326 --> 25:12.049
It's better never than late.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.566
This is really good.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.161
Where's it from?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.561
I stole it from the faculty lounge.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.088
They have a pretty decent espresso machine.

25:37.560 --> 25:38.925
You're incorrigible.

25:39.680 --> 25:40.841
That's what they tell me.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.241
You don't agree?

25:44.400 --> 25:45.686
I just know what I like.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.767
And you don't mind
breaking the rules to get it.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.560
Well

25:51.240 --> 25:53.368
if the risk is worth the reward.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.366
I don't see why not.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.959
What about you?

26:02.960 --> 26:05.566
You don't end up
at Sword and Cross by following the rules.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.085
You got a little rebel in you?

26:09.680 --> 26:11.205
I'm just misunderstood.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.086
No, I see it.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.321
You got a spark.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
What do you mean?

26:19.000 --> 26:22.891
Means you're the kind of person who'd rather
do what's right than what you're told.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.960
It means you're trouble.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.683
You think you know me, huh?

26:31.280 --> 26:32.805
I know what I like.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.120
Time's up.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.244
Roland's having a party this Friday.

26:54.245 --> 26:55.479
- Yeah?
- It's just casual.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.050
- You can bring a friend.
- Okay.

26:57.120 --> 27:00.169
Bunch of us get together at the end
of the week to blow off some steam.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
Thanks.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.851
Aren't you in this class?

27:06.120 --> 27:07.963
Oh, I've heard it all before.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.684
En garde! Allez!

27:24.520 --> 27:26.249
How well did they think this through?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.121
You know, giving weapons to
heavily medicated teenagers

27:29.122 --> 27:31.088
with poor impulse control and anger issues.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.280
Halt!

27:35.480 --> 27:37.960
Alright, change partners.
Sparks, you're up.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.684
Price, let's see
if you've been paying attention.

27:45.600 --> 27:46.931
Remember what I showed you?

27:47.440 --> 27:48.521
Not really.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.041
En garde!

27:56.240 --> 27:57.240
Allez!

28:05.800 --> 28:07.086
That wasn't terrible

28:07.160 --> 28:09.083
considering it was just your first time.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
Alright.

28:10.760 --> 28:11.807
Switch partners.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.004
Grigori. Come on over.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.480
En garde!

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
Allez!

29:09.600 --> 29:10.601
Very good.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.170
One more. En garde.

29:16.680 --> 29:17.680
Allez!

29:26.800 --> 29:28.006
Grigori, halt.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.040
Halt!

29:31.080 --> 29:32.080
Halt!

29:34.840 --> 29:36.205
Both of you, halt!

30:04.880 --> 30:06.370
I give it a week.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.721
What about the whole baptism thing?
Could that affect her?

30:08.920 --> 30:10.081
The details don't matter.

30:10.082 --> 30:14.404
Grigori always finds something to obsess
over but it never makes a difference.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.882
Now y'all just need to relax
and accept that Luce is gonna die

30:18.000 --> 30:21.163
and there's nothing you or Daniel
or Miss Sophia can do to stop it.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.210
I thought you'd never done this before?

30:23.400 --> 30:24.481
I haven't.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.689
My body just took over.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.850
Like I knew exactly what to do.

30:28.920 --> 30:29.920
Huh.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.565
It was weird. Have you ever felt that?

30:31.566 --> 30:34.006
Yeah, I was kinda like
that with trigonometry.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.162
It all just fell into place
so at first I was like

30:36.520 --> 30:38.239
'wow, I'm a genius.'

30:38.240 --> 30:42.404
But then I remembered that we covered it last
year so I guess that's not as impressive.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.450
You got it bad, huh?

30:48.320 --> 30:49.606
No, it's not like that.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.686
Well, maybe it is.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.083
It's just I have these
feelings about Daniel.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.491
Like I know him.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.608
Like I've known him for a really long time.

30:57.720 --> 31:00.451
Yeah, maybe you guys
went to preschool together or something.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.323
Well I asked him
if we'd met before and he said no

31:03.324 --> 31:05.402
and he basically ran away. It was strange.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
Yeah.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.011
Something definitely not quite... hmm.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.520
What do you mean?

31:15.640 --> 31:17.590
I can get in a lot of trouble
if you tell anybody

31:17.680 --> 31:19.156
what I'm about to say to you, okay?

31:19.180 --> 31:20.180
I won't.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.121
So I volunteer in the
office for my free period

31:22.122 --> 31:24.842
which I know sounds totally lame
but is actually kind of cool and fun

31:24.843 --> 31:26.569
in its own weird way, sort of.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.843
Turns out Randy is totally useless
when it comes to computers.

31:30.844 --> 31:33.730
So he asks yours truly
to do the most basic tasks like

31:33.760 --> 31:37.526
find files on his desktop and search for
videos of sneezing hedgehogs or whatever.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.011
Meaning.

31:40.160 --> 31:44.484
I have full access
to everybody's academic records.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.324
I've looked at Daniel's file.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.491
It's empty-

31:50.240 --> 31:53.844
He's got no home address,
no emergency contact, nothing.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.126
- Do you like this?
- Yeah.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.929
It's the same with all those kids.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.016
There's just something not quite right
about that whole group.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.756
You never hear them talk about
their families or their old schools.

32:03.780 --> 32:07.227
They barely ever go to class and it's like
they all knew each other from before.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.326
Wait, who do you mean?

32:08.400 --> 32:09.481
Daniel arrived first.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.279
He transferred at the beginning
of last year and then Gabbe.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.256
The tall blonde
that's always hanging around him?

32:14.280 --> 32:16.651
Yep, 85 percent confectionery
sugar by volume.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.960
Then Arriane.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.876
Oh yeah, she showed me around my first day.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.564
And Molly. Serious defective.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.204
And Roland, I have literally no idea
how he passes his weekly pee test

32:25.205 --> 32:29.079
and then Mr. Future 25 Years to Life,
Cam, transferred in last spring.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.081
Miss Sophia, too.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.209
She's new this year and totally ignores
everyone except her favourites.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.236
Well what do you make of it?

32:35.260 --> 32:36.830
Beats me.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.004
- I can't believe it.
- What?

32:45.080 --> 32:47.481
I'm actually going to one
of Roland's parties.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.004
Oh, don't you two look lovely?

32:55.480 --> 32:56.527
Thanks.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.971
You do too. As always.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.721
Aren't you sweet.

33:03.520 --> 33:05.124
Is it wrong that I kind of hate her?

33:05.160 --> 33:08.002
Why, because she's a flawless,
honey-scented, spray tanned,

33:08.003 --> 33:10.885
bikini waxed manicured
blond-fembot who's always smiling

33:10.886 --> 33:13.326
and is at this moment kissing your crush?

33:13.960 --> 33:15.450
Yeah, pretty much that.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.526
It might be wrong, but I totally get it.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.765
Anybody order drinks?

33:37.160 --> 33:39.845
I'm still trying to figure out
how you ended up here.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.604
Well you invited me, remember.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.205
That's not what I meant.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.008
With the rest of us it's obvious, right?

33:46.560 --> 33:47.561
Drugs.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.081
Vandalism.

33:49.480 --> 33:50.481
Depression.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.400
Nymphomania.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.126
So why did you end up at a place like this?

33:59.080 --> 34:01.401
Maybe I'm not as innocent as I look.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.929
- Hello.
- Hi.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.284
Is that a Flying Lotus jacket?

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
Yeah.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.047
You are such a hipster.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.164
In... in a good way, I mean.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.040
Like you know,
it's not like you're trying to be cool.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.364
Like you're actually cool.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.440
Wow.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.808
I've been accused of a
lot of things in my life

34:44.320 --> 34:45.525
but never that.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.759
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Thank you.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.827
Oh, is that for me?

34:56.828 --> 34:58.948
Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.200
Sure.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.560
Um...

35:01.760 --> 35:02.886
So...

35:04.400 --> 35:05.925
Is it from a show, or...?

35:05.960 --> 35:07.564
Yeah. He's amazing live.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.404
I saw him in Asheville with Teebs.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.405
Get out of it. Teebs is my favourite
post-Dilla artist.

35:12.406 --> 35:13.726
Well Thundercat changed my life.

35:13.727 --> 35:15.882
Well no, except maybe for Thundercat.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.889
Have you heard the Daylight remix?

35:18.240 --> 35:19.240
That bass.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.040
Exactly.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.047
Yes.

35:35.640 --> 35:36.846
Bad memories?

35:37.920 --> 35:39.490
So do you still think about him?

35:39.880 --> 35:40.880
Who?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.847
The boy you killed. Trevor.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.366
You know, tall, easy on the eyes.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.720
Well at least he was before
he hooked up with you.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.088
Now he's not so much to look at.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.766
How do you know about him?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.520
- I know a lot about you, Crazy Luce.
- Get that away from me.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.243
I'll bet I know you better than
you know yourself.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.464
For someone who doesn't like fire,
it sure does seem to like you.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.480
That's enough!

36:07.481 --> 36:10.796
Shut up, Arri, before I give you a scar
on your face to match the one on your back.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.310
Back off, Molly.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.524
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.067
What are you doing?

36:16.100 --> 36:18.162
Just having some fun
with your psycho girlfriend.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.929
Stay away from Luce.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.507
You hear me?

36:21.540 --> 36:23.224
Oh, you've lost track, Cam.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.211
You always want what you can't have.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.804
This time she's mine.

36:33.840 --> 36:34.966
Lay off me!

36:39.160 --> 36:40.844
There's definitely life in outer space!

36:40.920 --> 36:42.365
Hey! Where's Luce?

36:42.440 --> 36:44.602
Um, I don't know.
I thought that she was with you.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.323
(0K8)'-

36:47.400 --> 36:48.876
She doesn't need your kind of help.

36:48.900 --> 36:50.306
Who's gonna protect her, you?

36:50.307 --> 36:53.622
You know, you lovebirds need
to relax, huh? It's a party.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.656
You know, I'm feeling pretty tired
all of a sudden, actually.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.819
I think I'm just gonna go.

36:58.820 --> 36:59.980
You want me to walk with you?

37:00.020 --> 37:01.590
No, it's okay. You should stay.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Hello?

37:45.160 --> 37:46.160
Molly.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.929
Molly, come on. I know it's you.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.201
Where's Trevor?

38:59.440 --> 39:00.601
I'm so sorry.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.248
I'm so sorry.

39:02.249 --> 39:04.447
What did you do, you freak!

39:04.480 --> 39:05.527
It's my fault.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.806
I'm so sorry.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.967
So tell me, how was your first week
at Sword and Cross'?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
Fine.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.324
No incidents to report?

40:01.600 --> 40:03.648
Visions? Nightmares?

40:04.920 --> 40:05.920
No.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.291
What about your shadows?

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Good.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
Good.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.880
Good.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
What's wrong?

41:45.280 --> 41:46.280
Nothing.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.129
I just can't get past it.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.120
What?

41:54.640 --> 41:56.369
This feeling that I know you.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.731
Haven't we been through this?

42:03.320 --> 42:04.320
Yeah, but...

42:07.040 --> 42:08.371
I don't believe you.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.649
There is something between us.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.004
And you feel it too, don't you?

42:15.400 --> 42:16.845
Alright. Okay.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.208
You're right.
I should have just told you the truth.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.206
It's...

42:23.440 --> 42:26.724
Like I realise I haven't been
very warm towards you, and...

42:26.725 --> 42:28.085
You've been a real dick.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.427
Yeah, but believe me.

42:29.428 --> 42:31.991
You've got to know
it's not because of anything you've done.

42:32.640 --> 42:33.759
See, there's this girl...

42:33.760 --> 42:34.761
Gabbe?

42:35.680 --> 42:37.170
What? No.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.921
No, not Gabbe.
No, just someone else. Another girl.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.811
I guess you could say
I'm not with her anymore, but.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.041
I still love her.

42:47.760 --> 42:48.956
What I'm trying to say is...

42:48.980 --> 42:51.460
You're a mess and I'm
better off without you?

42:53.200 --> 42:54.531
Something like that.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.086
It's not that simple.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.243
You can't tell someone how to feel.

43:00.840 --> 43:01.840
Yeah.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.690
I wish things could be different.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.691
Hey! Don't go.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.922
There you are. I was worried about you.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.128
You left the party without saying goodbye.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
What's wrong?

43:45.040 --> 43:46.082
Luce?

43:46.120 --> 43:47.610
Stop! Talk to me!

43:48.080 --> 43:50.280
I had an interesting conversation
with Molly last night.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.320
(0K8)'-

43:51.480 --> 43:53.130
She knew things about me.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.050
Things I haven't shared with anyone.

43:55.051 --> 43:56.246
And...?

43:56.320 --> 43:58.288
Someone's been talking to her.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.084
Someone who's read my file.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.724
Oh right, 'cause that makes perfect sense.

44:03.725 --> 44:07.004
I betrayed your trust to a ruthless,
soulless, unimaginative bully

44:07.005 --> 44:09.890
with suspect hygiene and poor
language skills in exchange for what?

44:10.000 --> 44:13.368
Oh, two free body piercings
and a prison tattoo.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.489
I was sure I'd get away with it,
but you caught me.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.484
Well, at least you're
big enough to admit it.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.923
What's wrong? Really?

44:26.080 --> 44:27.650
You have read my file, haven't you?

44:27.720 --> 44:28.801
Of course.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.686
So then you know about...

44:30.960 --> 44:32.371
Your shadows?

44:33.320 --> 44:34.321
Do you still see them?

44:34.440 --> 44:35.440
Yeah.

44:37.360 --> 44:38.521
Do you see them right now?

44:38.600 --> 44:42.002
No. But since I've been here
they've gotten a lot worse.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.210
And I'm scared.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.150
I'm scared somebody's going to get hurt.

44:46.151 --> 44:47.451
No, don't be ridiculous.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.527
I'm not.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.764
Trevor was just standing there.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.483
He was just standing there

44:54.484 --> 44:57.927
and we...
- Okay. Tell me... tell me exactly what happened.

44:57.960 --> 45:00.004
Trevor acted like I didn't exist all year

45:00.005 --> 45:02.367
and then suddenly at this party
he was flirting with me.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.124
Come up to the cabin with me.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.647
Just one time I wanted to feel

45:09.440 --> 45:10.646
normal.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.282
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

45:26.800 --> 45:27.800
Did you hear that?

45:28.960 --> 45:30.769
Trevor, are you sure that we're alone?

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
Luce.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.200
Relax.

45:51.480 --> 45:52.480
No.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.210
Stop. Stop. Get off. Get off!

45:55.240 --> 45:57.003
- What the hell?
- Please, get out of here.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.004
What's going on?

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
No. No!

46:01.080 --> 46:02.080
Luce?

46:02.360 --> 46:04.010
The shadows were bigger than ever.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.440
And then suddenly everything exploded.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.639
And I don't know how but I was outside
and Trevor didn't make it.

46:12.640 --> 46:13.640
Trevor!

46:27.480 --> 46:29.323
Where's Trevor? Tell me.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.201
I'm so sorry.

46:31.880 --> 46:32.942
I'm so sorry.

46:32.943 --> 46:34.981
What did you do, you freak?

46:35.040 --> 46:37.327
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

46:37.880 --> 46:38.927
Trevor!

46:39.760 --> 46:42.286
And he's dead because
there's something wrong with me.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.282
And I'm really glad you
want to be my friend

46:45.283 --> 46:48.602
but you should stay away from me
because I'm dangerous.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.084
Did you want him to die?

46:52.160 --> 46:53.243
No.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.845
Did you try to hurt him?

46:57.280 --> 46:58.322
No.

46:58.323 --> 47:00.527
Well then it's not your fault.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.489
You don't need to be alone, Luce.
You need a friend.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.165
Let me help you.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.480
Why?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.123
Because that's what friends do.

47:26.360 --> 47:31.207
Last time we were discussing how it was
Lucifer's pride that led to the fall.

47:32.960 --> 47:33.960
Yes.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.364
So who can translate?

47:36.880 --> 47:39.201
Humilitas homines sanctis

47:39.560 --> 47:42.166
angelis similes facit

47:42.400 --> 47:46.564
<i>et superma ex angefis demones fan“.</i>

47:46.680 --> 47:47.841
Anyone?

47:50.080 --> 47:52.287
It was pride that turned
angels into devils.

47:52.288 --> 47:54.009
What was that, Luce?

47:55.280 --> 47:57.203
It is humility that makes men as angels.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.561
It was pride that turned
angels into devils.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.566
We have a Latin scholar in our midst.

48:06.720 --> 48:08.131
No, I've never...

48:09.560 --> 48:10.891
It was just a guess.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.724
So how does that relate to the rebel angel?

48:19.440 --> 48:23.411
Wasn't it his pride,
his stubborn pursuit of love over God

48:23.480 --> 48:26.245
that led to the Fallen
being trapped on earth?

48:26.960 --> 48:28.041
Arriane?

48:29.200 --> 48:33.285
I'm tired of listening to you twist these
religious fables to fit your own beliefs.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.364
You tell this story of yours
as is love was a choice.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.404
I don't care for your tone.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.603
Maybe you're just pissed the rebel angel
chose the wrong girl.

48:43.680 --> 48:44.966
Get out.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.530
Gladly.

48:47.360 --> 48:49.681
I'd rather burn in hell for all eternity

48:49.682 --> 48:54.368
than have to listen to one more second
of your pious self-satisfied ravings.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.799
That was kind of awesome.

49:01.800 --> 49:02.867
Yeah.

49:02.868 --> 49:04.305
Do you think she'll get suspended?

49:04.380 --> 49:05.962
I doubt she even gets detention.

49:05.963 --> 49:07.689
Those kids get away with everything.

49:08.840 --> 49:11.399
Hey, I forgot my sweater.
I'll catch up with you guys.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.400
(0K8)'-

49:15.280 --> 49:18.124
Listen to me.
You've got to keep your eye on Cam.

49:18.680 --> 49:19.806
What are you talking about?

49:19.880 --> 49:23.679
I don't believe the statue was an accident.
She's in danger.

49:23.680 --> 49:26.126
I saw him on the upper floor
just before it happened.

49:26.240 --> 49:27.480
Why would he do that?

49:27.640 --> 49:29.563
You heard. She isn't baptized.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.489
She needs our protection. She's...

49:34.120 --> 49:36.122
Sorry, I just... l forgot my sweater.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.725
I'll go talk to her.

50:18.560 --> 50:19.641
Hey Luce!

50:20.200 --> 50:21.200
Wait.

50:22.920 --> 50:23.920
What?

50:24.040 --> 50:25.241
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

50:25.242 --> 50:27.208
I just thought maybe
we could walk together.

50:27.680 --> 50:28.680
Oh.

50:29.680 --> 50:30.806
Sure.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.728
What were you working on in class today?

50:37.880 --> 50:39.325
Nothing. It's ah...

50:40.080 --> 50:42.242
sort of a graphic novel.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.240
What kind of story?

50:45.680 --> 50:47.489
I guess you could call it a romance.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.364
Does it have a happy ending?

50:49.760 --> 50:50.847
I don't know.

50:50.848 --> 50:51.971
You don't know how it ends?

50:52.040 --> 50:53.644
No, not yet.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.845
I'm sort of stuck, to be honest.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.326
Well let's hear it. Tell me your story.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.442
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.680
No?

51:05.880 --> 51:07.609
Maybe I could help you with the ending.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.040
(0K8)'-

51:15.280 --> 51:16.964
It's about this boy and this girl

51:17.480 --> 51:19.323
and they love each other more than anything

51:20.280 --> 51:21.884
but they can never be together.

51:23.640 --> 51:24.682
Why?

51:24.683 --> 51:26.170
Because there's this curse.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.808
Every seventeen years they meet

51:30.360 --> 51:31.885
and they fall in love

51:34.080 --> 51:37.527
and then just when they're happiest,
the girl dies.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.566
So it's a tragedy?

51:45.680 --> 51:47.170
What happens to the boy?

51:51.040 --> 51:52.041
He waits.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.243
He doesn't age or change.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.290
He remains in love.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.441
Years pass, and eventually she returns.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.201
The same girl?

52:06.440 --> 52:07.566
She's changed.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.128
She has a new name, new family.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.005
She has no memory of him

52:14.320 --> 52:15.810
but he knows it's her.

52:17.440 --> 52:18.440
It's her soul

52:19.280 --> 52:20.486
reincarnated.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.569
And they fall in love.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.807
Always.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.049
I mean, each time it's slightly different.

52:34.200 --> 52:37.283
There are infinite versions
but the end is always the same.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.128
But then all it takes is a kiss

52:41.040 --> 52:42.405
and she's gone.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.005
Who put the curse on them?

52:47.400 --> 52:49.004
It was the devil himself.

52:49.760 --> 52:52.161
He was jealous of their love,
so he tried to break it.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.721
There has to be something
they can do, right?

52:57.200 --> 52:58.645
He's tried everything.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.566
He tries looking for her

53:03.240 --> 53:04.730
then tries to avoid her.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.526
Tries to run away
from the inevitable heartbreak.

53:08.760 --> 53:11.491
But the curse always finds a way,
no matter what.

53:12.320 --> 53:13.810
The girl in your story.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.601
Is she the one you mentioned at the pool?

53:17.960 --> 53:19.405
The girl you're still in love with?

53:20.480 --> 53:22.528
She's the inspiration, yeah.

53:26.200 --> 53:27.326
This girl?

53:30.560 --> 53:32.324
Alright, you got me. It's um...

53:33.040 --> 53:35.247
I was using you for her
current incarnation.

53:35.640 --> 53:37.244
This is meant to be Paris.

53:38.960 --> 53:41.201
In 1723.

53:41.240 --> 53:42.730
It's stupid.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.601
Why me?

53:46.080 --> 53:47.605
Because you're beautiful.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.524
But I messed up the eyes.

53:57.120 --> 53:59.441
There's always been
something about your eyes.

54:13.880 --> 54:14.881
What's wrong?

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
Nothing.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.367
Tell me about this place.
Have you been there before?

54:22.400 --> 54:23.400
Does it matter?

54:23.880 --> 54:25.291
- Yes.
- Why?

54:26.080 --> 54:28.208
I've never travelled before.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.482
I've never even left the country.

54:32.160 --> 54:34.806
But I know that
there's a café just off to the right

54:34.807 --> 54:37.446
and I know it smells like
jasmine after it rains.

54:37.447 --> 54:41.729
And I know that the old man that runs the café
is kind to his dog and he's cruel to his wife

54:41.760 --> 54:44.240
and I know these things
because I've been there.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.164
And I've been there with you.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.850
Oh, Luce, come on.

54:51.280 --> 54:52.280
Don't.

54:53.280 --> 54:55.123
Don't tell me that I'm crazy.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.324
Luce, its' a drawing, alright?

54:57.400 --> 54:59.243
It's a story, that's all.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.601
You're lying.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.527
I wish I could tell you
what you want to hear.

55:10.800 --> 55:11.801
I'm sorry.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.120
Blow.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.211
Happy birthday, Luce.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.161
How'd you know?

55:49.760 --> 55:51.091
Did you make a wish?

55:52.840 --> 55:54.604
I can't tell you. It won't come true.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.290
Oh, that's okay.

55:56.800 --> 55:58.484
I already know what you wished for.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.640
Oh yeah?

56:00.800 --> 56:02.086
What'd I wish for?

56:02.240 --> 56:03.240
Answers.

56:04.080 --> 56:05.491
You want the truth.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.606
Meet me at the arches at eight
and I'll tell you everything.

56:11.880 --> 56:12.880
And Luce?

56:14.200 --> 56:15.531
Wear something nice.

56:16.440 --> 56:17.805
It's party time.

57:01.840 --> 57:03.001
Look at you.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.080
Oh, wow.

57:06.560 --> 57:07.607
Is it yours?

57:08.080 --> 57:09.080
For tonight.

57:10.320 --> 57:11.765
How'd you manage that?

57:12.480 --> 57:14.323
It's Roland's special talent.

57:14.400 --> 57:16.721
Anything you want, he can get it for you.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.450
Am I going to regret this?

57:19.440 --> 57:21.363
There's only one way to find out.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.288
- Come on.
- No way, I drive.

57:28.360 --> 57:31.091
You really want to start the night by
saying no to the girl?

57:32.680 --> 57:33.680
(0K8)'-

58:17.880 --> 58:19.370
What am I doing here with you?

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
Celebrating.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.167
You're good at that.

58:22.560 --> 58:24.162
Every time I ask you a question

58:24.163 --> 58:26.640
you have some clever
way of avoiding the answer.

58:26.960 --> 58:28.200
That's not true.

58:28.600 --> 58:31.001
Here's an example. Where did you grow up?

58:35.600 --> 58:36.662
See?

58:36.740 --> 58:38.841
How come you won't tell me
anything about yourself?

58:38.920 --> 58:41.651
Because I'm having a nice time
and I don't want to ruin it.

58:42.800 --> 58:44.290
It's that bad, huh?

58:45.080 --> 58:46.241
I prefer this.

58:50.800 --> 58:52.290
You promised answers.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.042
Come on, Luce. It's your birthday.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.647
I'm thinking there's something else
you might want.

59:18.880 --> 59:20.006
What are you doing?

59:20.240 --> 59:22.239
- Stop!
- I told you to stay away from her.

59:22.240 --> 59:23.339
Daniel, what are you doing?

59:23.340 --> 59:25.429
- Why, because you care so much about her?
- Stop it!

59:25.430 --> 59:27.704
Stop!
- No, because I know what you're capable of.

59:27.705 --> 59:29.289
You're still with Lucifer. Admit it!

59:29.360 --> 59:31.567
Why don't you tell her, Daniel?
Tell her everything.

59:31.640 --> 59:33.007
- She wants the truth.
- Stop it!

59:33.008 --> 59:34.044
Just stay away from her!

59:34.045 --> 59:35.465
You don't have a say in it.

59:35.520 --> 59:38.285
I don't know what's going on here
but it has nothing to do with me.

59:53.240 --> 59:56.369
I never bought into that idea that
there's one person you're meant to be with

59:56.370 --> 01:00:00.763
but my visions are so real
and my feelings are so real

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.281
it's like past lives or something.
I don't know.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.246
And everything's connected to Daniel
somehow but he keeps pushing me away.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.562
And Cam's hiding something too.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.841
So what do you think?

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.416
I think you're a jerk for not telling me
it was your birthday

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.762
but I'm willing to overlook that
because this is so ridiculously juicy.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.610
Do you believe in reincarnation?

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.004
No. Not at all.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.050
I didn't think so either but

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.686
there has to be
some sort of explanation for this.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400
Hmm.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.047
Maybe I can help.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.240
What are you doing?

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.364
We just need one more thing.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.480
What?

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.841
How do you know which room Todd's in?

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.251
So how does this work exactly?

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.720
Have you got those yearbook photos?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:09.082
Todd's been working on this really
cool facial recognition algorithm.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.004
It's not all my code.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.844
It was developed at Carnegie Mellon,

01:01:12.845 --> 01:01:16.003
but I've tweaked it a little.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.930
He's so modest.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920
Sorry.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.249
This might take a minute.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.925
It's just searching.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.805
Luce? Hello?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.161
We've got hits.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440
Whoa.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.561
Look at the name.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.404
It must be a relative.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.850
Oh, What?

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.479
The actual... Fuck.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.241
Print it.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520
I'll get it.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.364
Todd, I'm counting on
you having some sort of explanation

01:02:42.365 --> 01:02:44.601
because I am really struggling here.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.529
I haven't got the faintest idea.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.240
I love you.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.568
Let's see what else we can find.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.291
It's happening again.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.760
No.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.571
Leave me alone!

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.327
Luce? Everything okay?

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.120
Luce?

01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:59.640
Penn!

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.850
I've gotta find Penn!

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200
Penn!

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.485
Penn, where are you?

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.679
Todd!

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.170
I've gotta find Penn!

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.611
- No!
- Penn!

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.007
Todd!

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.121
Todd!

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280
No!

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.999
Here at the school infirmary

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.129
we provide the same care
she'd receive at the hospital.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.531
I want to take her home.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.127
The doctor's clear. She needs to
remain under clinical supervision.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.628
For how long?

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.906
Until she's stable.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.446
You should get some rest.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.329
We'll call you at the hotel as soon
as Luce is able to receive visitors.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.689
There was nothing we could have done.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.290
I refuse to accept that.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.376
I could have warned her.
I could have been there...

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.522
When has that ever helped?

01:06:48.523 --> 01:06:49.839
It doesn't matter, okay?

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.729
She needs us and we let her down.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:53.689
Is this a criminal investigation?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.841
Not at the moment.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.009
The fire was caused by lightning.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.003
That report is preliminary.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.487
Given the similarity to
the Trevor Beckman case

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.439
we'll definitely want to question her.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.886
I don't want you talking to her
without her attorney present.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.210
We come together today

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.962
to mourn the loss of a dear friend,
a kind and generous...

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.685
whose life was far
too brief to mourn the loss...

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.481
whose tragic passing comes
as a shock to us all.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.521
We will always remember a kind
and generous friend

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.921
someone whose company was always a pleasure

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.290
and although today
we are understandably overcome with grief

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.762
I ask you to have faith that in time

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.806
our pain will prove strengthening

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.402
and ultimately a testament

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.201
to how much Todd mattered

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.209
and always will.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.526
Not only was he a loving son

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.321
but he was also a kind and generous friend.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:10.408
We must transform our sadness
into something strengthening.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.007
That's how we celebrate his life

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:16.410
and ensure his legacy.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:21.205
You show up to his funeral
after you get him killed?

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:22.680
I know you're the one doing this.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.843
What are you talking about?

01:08:23.844 --> 01:08:26.127
The statue. The fire in the library.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.403
You were trying to kill her.

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:29.129
Killing Luce is your thing, Daniel.

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:30.645
Don't you dare...

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.444
What's the matter, Daniel?
You afraid of a little competition?

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.685
What I feel for Luce is real.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.729
She's different this time.
She deserves more than you can give her.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.371
If you come near her...

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:41.399
You'll What?

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.328
How many times do you
have to watch her die?

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.331
I love you.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.846
Luce!

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.046
Oh, Penn!

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200
Luce!

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680
Todd?

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.806
I'm sorry.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.119
I'm so, so sorry. It's my fault.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.451
Oh, don't say that.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.285
It's true. The shadows
were exactly the same.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.927
- It was the exact same...
- Stop it, okay?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.965
You did not cause this.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.771
I won't hear it.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400
(0K8)'-

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.486
I'm so sorry.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.126
Did you make a wish?

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.042
Past lives and destinies.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.690
You want the truth.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.096
She doesn't know me at all.
All it takes is a kiss.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.201
But he knows it's her.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.302
Luce! NO!

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:02.269
Kiss him and you'll die.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.091
Who put the curse on them?

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.201
It was the devil himself.

01:11:05.202 --> 01:11:07.407
Daniel, no!

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.245
Luce, no.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.846
You will die.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.241
You will die.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.286
You feeling better?

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.042
Every part of me hurts, but I'm alive.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.161
Well that's something.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.486
I remember.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.083
What?

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.100
Everything.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.920
The fire.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.920
You carrying me.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.776
Being in your arms, it felt like we were...

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.131
Well you were delirious.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.200
Maybe.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.124
But that's not all I remember.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.565
I remember this.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.249
I remember the day this was taken.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.480
What do you mean?

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.961
Enough!

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.930
I know what I know.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.845
My whole life people have
told me that I'm crazy.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.082
Luce.

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:12.684
Let's see if they're right.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.090
No Luce, get down from there.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.247
No, Luce.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.086
No!

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.203
It will always be you, Luce.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.644
Just as it always has been.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.371
Now is not the time for sentimentality.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
Luce?

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.485
I gave you this.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.964
It was a long time ago.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.365
How is this possible?

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.119
- It's okay.
- No, every bad thing

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.990
that's ever happened to
me is because of that.

01:16:08.991 --> 01:16:10.804
No, they can't hurt you. They just observe.

01:16:10.805 --> 01:16:12.801
The fires. They killed Trevor.

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:15.690
Luce, the shadows didn't cause the fire
and neither did you.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.569
They're called Announcers.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080
Look.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.042
Think of them as windows into the past.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.203
They're attracted to
the most important moments in your life.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.730
What am I seeing?

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.244
Our lives together.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.760
We've been in love for thousands of years.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.601
Luce, all your visions are real.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.730
So we're reincarnated?

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.361
You are.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.881
I'm...

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.921
An angel.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.409
I'm one of the Fallen.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.166
Stop!

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.771
Don't do it, Luce.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.491
Kiss him and you will die.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.689
This is why I tried so hard
to push you away but I can't.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.046
You didn't tell her?

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080
I'm so sorry.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.407
Unbelievable. You're unbelievable.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.489
What? I don't understand, why?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.922
The curse is my punishment
for not taking a side at the Fall.

01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:48.285
Luce, don't listen to him.

01:17:48.286 --> 01:17:50.567
Stay, Luce. I chose you.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.406
Ichoselove.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.043
Don't listen to him, Luce.

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.004
If you kiss him, you will die.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:58.726
- I've seen it a thousand times.
- No, this time it's different.

01:17:58.727 --> 01:18:00.131
I promise it is different.

01:18:00.132 --> 01:18:01.479
He's a liar, Luce.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.322
If you stay with me, I can protect you.

01:18:03.323 --> 01:18:04.765
You've seen me in my true form.

01:18:04.766 --> 01:18:06.039
This is different.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.239
I can protect you.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.480
This could be our chance.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.722
Please.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.802
Luce, I can offer you a future.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.120
A life.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.890
I can't lose you again.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.530
I know what I want.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.082
No!

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.646
I'm still here.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.725
You think you've beaten the curse?

01:19:06.726 --> 01:19:08.961
You have no idea how much danger she's in.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.161
Lucifer knows she's not baptized.

01:19:11.162 --> 01:19:12.603
I don't understand. Tell me why.

01:19:12.604 --> 01:19:14.841
He lifted the curse for
himself, not for you.

01:19:14.842 --> 01:19:16.203
He'll come for her now.

01:19:16.204 --> 01:19:17.804
Daniel can't protect you, Luce.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.280
I can!

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.045
She's safer with me!

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.808
There's a natural order to things, Daniel.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.405
You can't just do as you please.

01:19:28.406 --> 01:19:30.164
Well the cycle's been broken.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.210
Roland! Molly!

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.046
Luce!

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.441
You're coming with me!

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.448
Keep her safe. I need to deal with Cam.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.560
Where I'm taking her,
I don't want him to follow.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.963
He'll lead Lucifer right to us.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.365
They're all angels.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.962
I won't let you take her to Lucifer!

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.490
I don't answer to him anymore.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:34.321
You're the one putting
her in danger, Daniel.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.248
Don't pretend you even care about her!

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.446
Where are you going?

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.999
I can protect her.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.411
Stay away from her!

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.966
What the heck!

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.282
Back to your rooms. Shut the door!

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.885
This is a lockdown.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.845
Wait for the all clear.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.610
It's a lockdown. Shut the door.

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.122
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.011
I'm not your enemy.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.324
I'm not trying to kill her.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:05.760
Then who?

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.886
Luce! Wait!

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.403
She set the fire in the library. She...

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:14.640
Penn?

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.640
No!

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.245
No!

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.640
Go!

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.727
Luce, your time has come.
I am tired of waiting.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.725
This ends now.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.521
Every breath you take keeps Daniel
from his rightful place in heaven!

01:22:33.522 --> 01:22:35.921
- Daniel!
- You are the real curse.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.365
Luce!

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400
Luce!

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.810
Sophia, what have you done?

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.405
You claim to be a servant of God.

01:22:44.406 --> 01:22:46.323
I am. There's a war going on.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.439
Loyal soldiers do what they must.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.507
Including murder?

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.727
You refuse to see the bigger picture.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.450
You always have.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.442
With her gone you'd have been
forced to choose a side

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:00.446
and order would have been restored.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.240
Thank you.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.041
I don't understand why she'd do that.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.165
She's a fanatic, Luce.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.104
She fights for god, but she went too far.

01:23:14.105 --> 01:23:15.604
Why would Sophia kill Penn?

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.011
Why did she try to kill me?

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.368
You're not baptized.
If you die, it'll be forever.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:24.123
Sophia thought with you gone
I'd have no reason to stay on earth

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.690
and I'd return to heaven.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.961
But Cam was right.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.169
Lucifer will be coming for you.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.722
Which is why I need to
get you somewhere safe.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.451
I know a place. I have friends there.
They'll protect us.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.681
We have to go.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.922
I can't leave now. I can't leave Penn.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.200
We'll take care of her.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320
Penn!

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.245
She'll come with us. Go. Please.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.040
Luce.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.170
They'll take Penn with them.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.001
There's no more time. We have to go.

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.491
Wait a minute. Listen.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.601
My whole life I've been
searching for the truth.

01:23:57.602 --> 01:23:59.443
I've been trying to figure out who I am.

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.730
Why I never seem to fit in to the life
that was supposed to be mine.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.490
And now I'm terrified.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.923
I have more questions than
I ever have before

01:24:06.924 --> 01:24:08.968
but... this is it.

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.645
This is who I am.

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.970
This is where I belong.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.090
Right here, with you.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.446
I love you.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.047
I've known it from the
first moment I saw you.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.929
It will always be you, Luce.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.361
Forever.
