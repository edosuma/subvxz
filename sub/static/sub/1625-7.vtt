00:06.880 --> 00:08.380

forget his wallet?

00:08.381 --> 00:11.050
No, we saw that cat
we don't like.

00:11.051 --> 00:13.018
I tried to spray it
with a water bottle,

00:13.019 --> 00:16.055

so we ran.

really is coming.

over our wall?

00:33.140 --> 00:35.541
- That cat.
- What?

figuring out

what to do with Chestnut
this winter,

what do you think

sleeping arrangements.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.167

At least it was her bra.

08:27.114 --> 08:28.819
Mine would have killed
the kid.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.287

we could drive our truck

08:34.288 --> 08:35.421
to my Uncle's lumberyard
in the morning

08:35.422 --> 08:37.155
and get the wood
for the barn.

08:37.157 --> 08:39.792
Okay, but there seems to be
plenty of wood right here.

08:39.793 --> 08:41.063
Oh, hello.

08:42.964 --> 08:44.931
Don't be embarrassed,
Jacob.

08:44.932 --> 08:47.000
It's perfectly natural when
you're exposed to new things.

The first time I saw a picture
of those fat twins on scooters,

08:49.437 --> 08:52.806

and play with the horse?

08:55.209 --> 08:57.110
Both: Okay.

08:57.111 --> 08:58.945
And thank you for letting us
stay at your place.

08:59.446 --> 09:01.114

09:01.115 --> 09:03.182
You don't even know
what that means, Jebediah.

09:03.183 --> 09:05.918

and it's awesome.

09:09.189 --> 09:11.190

this is a good idea?

09:11.191 --> 09:12.725

he was.

09:12.726 --> 09:16.062
He was practically
raising a barn in his pants.

09:16.063 --> 09:18.731
We're fine,
they're fine.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.233

a typical male reaction?

09:28.642 --> 09:31.077
Not calling or texting
a girl you're interested in.

09:31.078 --> 09:32.812
Well, why don't you
just text Andy, then?

09:32.813 --> 09:34.480
What should I text?

09:34.481 --> 09:37.250
"Why so gay,
question mark"?

09:37.251 --> 09:38.851
I don't know.

09:38.852 --> 09:40.553
The only thing
I've ever texted to a guy is,

09:40.554 --> 09:44.824
"there's a cop behind you,
walk past me."

09:44.825 --> 09:46.259
Just say "hey."

09:46.260 --> 09:50.029
Okay.
I can do that.

09:50.030 --> 09:51.531
"Hey."

09:51.532 --> 09:56.102
Huh, it autocorrected
to "gay."

09:56.103 --> 09:58.871
Even the phone's
getting that vibe.

whose roommate
overdosed yesterday,

20:14.926 --> 20:17.394
so there's a spare room,
and I've decided to stay.

20:17.895 --> 20:19.096
Cool.

20:19.597 --> 20:21.431
So got any words
of wisdom

20:21.432 --> 20:23.233
for a kid trying to make it
in the world?

20:23.984 --> 20:25.902
No, do you?

20:25.903 --> 20:28.772
Look, just know you're going
to struggle for a while.

20:28.773 --> 20:30.040
Someone's going to ask you
what time it is,

20:30.041 --> 20:31.441
and when you look
at your watch,

20:31.442 --> 20:33.577
he's going to put
his penis on you.

20:33.578 --> 20:36.179
But like Dan Savage says,
it gets better.

20:36.180 --> 20:37.748
Although
it hasn't for me,

20:37.749 --> 20:39.950
so maybe that only applies
to questioning teens.

20:39.951 --> 20:42.352
In short, there's really
no point to anything,

20:42.353 --> 20:44.421
but sometimes, you get
to eat candy or have sex,

20:44.422 --> 20:46.225
and that's
when it all feels right.

[Cat meows]

20:50.128 --> 20:51.596
Oh, no.

20:53.097 --> 20:54.866
Caroline, the cat.

20:56.867 --> 20:58.470
I'm on my own.
Fine.

21:01.271 --> 21:04.241
Oh, no, you bastard,
not tonight.

21:04.242 --> 21:06.476
It is not going down
tonight.

21:06.477 --> 21:08.213
[Cat hisses]

21:10.214 --> 21:11.214
All right,
you win this one.

21:11.215 --> 21:12.784

21:17.989 --> 21:19.023
