WEBVTT

00:07.207 --> 00:09.743
[Molly]<i> And Jason</i>
<i>knows a Titan how?</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:13.246
We had friends in common.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.714
Had?

00:14.814 --> 00:16.916
-Have you seen him lately?
-Not in a while.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.586
Last time he showed up here,
he found a missing kid for me.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.388
And he seemed okay?

00:21.488 --> 00:23.590
I mean,
other than the whack suit?

00:23.690 --> 00:24.924
Yeah, tip-top.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.193
[sighs] Jason's in trouble.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.329
I need to find him.

00:29.396 --> 00:30.263
And then what?

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
Some people want him dead.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.601
I just want to help him.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.936
And I think you do, too.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.171
How does this happen?

00:38.872 --> 00:39.873
He was erratic.

00:40.673 --> 00:41.775
But he cared.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.877
Then he wakes up one day
and he's just...

00:45.345 --> 00:46.379
I don't even know.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.617
It's like the old Jason died.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.286
When Jason came back,

00:53.386 --> 00:55.055
was there anything
different about him,

00:56.056 --> 00:57.390
his voice, the way he walked?

00:57.457 --> 01:01.394
Like dead and come back
to life different?

01:01.461 --> 01:02.762
I don't know.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.731
I'm trying to figure this out
like you.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.733
What are you asking me?

01:09.202 --> 01:10.537
I need to speak with him.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.573
Fix this.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.109
And you think
you're the man for that job?

01:16.209 --> 01:18.044
[suspenseful music playing]

01:25.819 --> 01:27.420
Not just me.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.988
[music intensifies]

01:33.660 --> 01:35.762
[theme music playing]

01:46.606 --> 01:48.475
[Barbara]<i> Well,</i>
<i>what do you think?</i>

01:48.575 --> 01:50.076
Can you make it any bigger?

01:50.143 --> 01:51.511
[Barbara]<i> How big</i>
<i>do you need it?</i>

01:51.611 --> 01:53.746
Bigger than the Bat Signal.
At least.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.515
[Barbara]<i> The man takes out</i>
<i>one drug factory</i>

01:55.615 --> 01:57.317
<i>and thinks</i>
<i>he's the Prince of Gotham.</i>

01:57.417 --> 01:59.285
[Dick]<i> I was thinking</i>
<i>more like viceroy.</i>

02:02.822 --> 02:04.257
[knife clanging]

02:05.191 --> 02:06.793
What was that?

02:06.860 --> 02:09.095
Uh, batarang, actually.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.199
Huh?

02:13.299 --> 02:14.801
[Dick]<i> Hey, you sure you wanna</i>
<i>go to this gala thing tonight?</i>

02:14.868 --> 02:17.036
[sighs] Yeah. Dick?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.671
[Dick]<i> We could cozy up</i>
<i>in the Batcave</i>

02:18.771 --> 02:20.306
<i>and watch</i>
<i>the facial recognition comps.</i>

02:20.373 --> 02:22.175
Crane and Red Hood are
gonna get flagged tonight.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.376
I can feel it.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.012
You know what I can feel?
My hunger pangs.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.715
If I don't get
some hors d'oeuvres soon,

02:28.815 --> 02:31.718
I'm gonna eat these
poor goldfish.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.386
Vee will have you arrested.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.889
Their fate is in your hands.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.524
Don't be late.

02:37.624 --> 02:40.126
See you at eight.

02:40.193 --> 02:43.229
Hey, I thought you were
going to the gala?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.498
-I am.
-Pre-game meal?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.367
Have you seen
the dinners at those things?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.835
Chicken the size of golf balls.

02:48.902 --> 02:49.869
[Kory chuckles]

02:51.037 --> 02:51.971
Mmm. Dick.

02:53.373 --> 02:54.874
Oh, thanks.

02:54.974 --> 02:57.043
Enjoying some of
our good press?

02:57.143 --> 02:59.245
Barb asked me to look at it.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.914
It's a T in the sky.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.083
[chuckles] Yes.
Yes, that it is.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.251
[remote clicks]

03:05.351 --> 03:07.587
[projector whirring]

03:10.857 --> 03:12.058
[remote clicks]

03:12.158 --> 03:15.028
There. Between
the two red ones.

03:15.094 --> 03:16.262
[Conner] The blue one?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.198
[Blackfire]
That's where Krypton was.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.199
Home.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.603
I guess home is just in us,
whether we have one or not.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.508
Show me Tamaran.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.710
We'll have to switch galaxies.

03:30.777 --> 03:37.417
Try Z-3-X-4-5-8-9-I.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.552
[Conner] Did you just give me
your space address?

03:39.619 --> 03:42.222
-Yes, but, call first.
-[chuckles]

03:44.791 --> 03:45.625
Oh...

03:46.893 --> 03:48.228
[Blackfire] There she is.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.963
[Conner] Think you'll
ever go back?

03:50.964 --> 03:52.799
I don't know if I can.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.868
So you're staying.

03:58.705 --> 03:59.872
At least for tonight.

04:08.781 --> 04:10.483
[system beeps]

04:10.583 --> 04:11.618
Hey, Dick.

04:11.718 --> 04:12.652
[Dick over comms]
<i>Hey. What's up?</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:14.420
Someone's here to see you.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.656
I'm heading out.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.157
[Gar]<i> No. You're gonna</i>
<i>want to talk to him.</i>

04:18.257 --> 04:20.660
[Dick]<i> Gar, I can't be late.</i>

04:20.760 --> 04:22.295
He says he knows
you're Nightwing.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.233
Who is this?

04:27.300 --> 04:28.801
Says his name is Tim.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.437
Tim Drake.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.072
Maybe a friend of Crane's?

04:33.139 --> 04:34.274
That was right before
he told me

04:34.340 --> 04:35.675
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.252
[sighs]

04:46.319 --> 04:49.622
I was there. At the beginning.
At the end.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.695
I went to Haly's Circus
to see The Flying Graysons...

04:57.530 --> 04:58.831
the night
your parents were killed.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.035
You signed it for me
before the show.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.872
I remember
every move you performed.

05:08.274 --> 05:10.209
Then one day...

05:10.310 --> 05:13.112
I saw Batman and Robin
on the news chasing Penguin.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.116
Robin did
a one-handed meat-hook

05:17.183 --> 05:18.651
to scale a rain gutter...

05:20.153 --> 05:20.987
[sighs]

05:22.655 --> 05:26.826
A trapeze move only two people
in the world can do.

05:26.893 --> 05:29.529
You... and your dad.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.469
[chuckles softly]

05:38.971 --> 05:40.506
So, Robin pinched my moves.

05:40.573 --> 05:41.908
I can't copyright them.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.145
Then, the Titans made a splash.

05:46.212 --> 05:49.649
I heard they were good,
so I started keeping tabs.

05:49.716 --> 05:50.683
Guess what?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.887
Nightwing also does
the one-handed meat-hook.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.091
You were Robin.
Then, Nightwing.

06:05.398 --> 06:06.899
Keep 'em. I got copies.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.035
[sighs]

06:10.203 --> 06:11.070
Thank you.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.909
Like I said, stole my moves.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.010
Come on, follow me.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.418
[female reporter]<i> About a dozen</i>
<i>downtown businesses</i>

06:25.518 --> 06:28.254
<i>were boarded up</i>
<i>and glass-littered sidewalks</i>

06:28.354 --> 06:31.457
<i>following an exchange of fire</i>
<i>that wounded</i>
<i>more than two dozen...</i>

06:31.557 --> 06:34.227
My dad got shot and the Titans
put on a light show?

06:34.293 --> 06:35.795
[female reporter]<i> Stay out...</i>

06:40.099 --> 06:41.267
I'm sorry about your dad.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.437
It wouldn't have happened
if Batman were here.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.640
[Tim] You need help.

06:48.975 --> 06:49.809
Help?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.613
I want to be the next Robin.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.549
[scoffs]

06:58.117 --> 06:59.886
[smacks lips]
Look, you're barking
up the wrong tree.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.220
I appreciate your imagination,

07:01.287 --> 07:02.655
but Bruce Wayne
is just a philanthropist

07:02.755 --> 07:04.490
currently consulting in Europe.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.459
I'm just a former
Detroit city cop.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.828
We don't wear capes.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.563
Oh, next you'll tell me
there's no Batcave.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.167
Come on,
I'll give you a lift home.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.304
[sighs]

07:21.741 --> 07:24.811
[machine whirring]

07:34.454 --> 07:35.621
I need more!

07:36.956 --> 07:37.924
[whirring stops]

07:45.131 --> 07:46.432
You're back.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.201
Come on, bring it in.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.802
I need another inhaler, Crane.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.940
Well, you're gonna have to
cook it yourself.

07:54.006 --> 07:54.941
I'm fresh out.

07:56.008 --> 07:56.976
What about that?

07:58.444 --> 08:00.213
[Crane] That is
too concentrated.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.114
Deadly in its uncut form.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.450
[breathing heavily]
This is a fuck show.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.688
[Crane] J? J-dawg.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.389
Take heart, my friend.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.892
We are just a few swift strokes

08:12.992 --> 08:15.995
away from the sweetest comeback

08:16.062 --> 08:17.396
the world has ever seen.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.232
I mean, they're gonna make
a biopic about us.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.968
How we met,
our ups, our downs...

08:22.034 --> 08:23.903
How the Titans wiped us out?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.338
Do you remember
why we're here?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.574
The details are hazy, Crane.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.010
You zombified me,
remember that?

08:31.077 --> 08:32.044
I do remember.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.581
Well, um,
quick refresher course.

08:35.681 --> 08:40.253
So this pump station
is perched directly above
the Courtland Valve station,

08:40.353 --> 08:43.689
which controls
all of the water supply
for all of Gotham.

08:43.756 --> 08:47.927
So all I need to do
is drill through
this flimsy piece of steel

08:48.027 --> 08:49.929
that is covering the floor.

08:50.029 --> 08:54.400
Then I take my little friend
there and I dump it into
the water supply and...

08:54.500 --> 08:58.437
-[drilling]
-[laughing]

09:00.106 --> 09:03.209
[laughing]

09:05.511 --> 09:07.613
You think that's funny?

09:07.713 --> 09:12.952
Just wait until you see
what we're gonna do to Gotham
when we're done here,

09:13.052 --> 09:14.353
[chuckles]

09:14.420 --> 09:17.089
Gotham is going
to destroy itself.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.227
House by house,
family by family.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.462
This plan
is a fucking joke, Crane.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.630
And so are you.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.132
Me?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.267
But I reached over
to the other side,

09:28.367 --> 09:32.371
-dragged you back
to the living...
-So you could use me.

09:32.438 --> 09:35.041
Yes, so I could use you.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.743
Life is transactional,
my dear boy.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.714
Well, I gave you life.

09:41.781 --> 09:46.218
You gave me secrets
about Batman
and Dick Grayson,

09:46.285 --> 09:48.120
and, uh, what was his name?

09:48.220 --> 09:49.121
Hank?

09:50.923 --> 09:52.592
I'm done telling secrets.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.160
Done being fucking used.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.296
[Jason grunts]

10:01.968 --> 10:03.636
Are you done? [spits]

10:05.905 --> 10:06.806
Almost.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.011
Now I'm done.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.519
You sure you don't
want me to drop you
at the Noodle House?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.754
That's far enough.

10:21.821 --> 10:22.788
My cousin lives
around the corner.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.025
Hey, listen.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.594
I'm not gonna tell anybody,
if that's what
you're worried about.

10:29.528 --> 10:30.830
I know the rules.

10:30.930 --> 10:33.332
Some secrets
have to be kept.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.501
If I can do anything
for your dad...

10:37.136 --> 10:38.704
or your family, let me know.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.476
There's one last thing
I haven't figured out yet.

10:45.177 --> 10:48.180
Who the second Robin was?
The dead one.

10:48.280 --> 10:52.351
I used to think it was
Jason Todd because he was
also a Bruce Wayne kid.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.387
But then,
I saw him the other night.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.556
-You saw Jason Todd?
-The night my father was shot.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.160
He was standing across
the street from the shop
wearing a hoody.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.729
And you recognized him
from across the street?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.398
He walked like Robin.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.532
I studied him, too.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.135
It's nice to meet you, Tim.

11:10.369 --> 11:11.303
We'll meet again.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.746
[Barbara] Hey, I'm coming down.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.914
[Dick over comms]
<i>I'm not there yet.</i>

11:23.049 --> 11:24.717
It smells like a cancelation.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.186
-Just got a strange tip.
<i>-Yeah, me, too.</i>

11:27.253 --> 11:30.489
Police Commissioner
Gordon's going to the gala
without Richard Grayson.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.925
Can you access Gotham's
security video outside

11:33.025 --> 11:34.760
the Drake restaurant
two nights ago?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.929
<i>The night of the attack.</i>
<i>Somebody says they saw Jason.</i>

11:37.029 --> 11:38.831
We did that already.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.733
Can you do
a face recognition sweep?

11:41.867 --> 11:44.270
-This is gonna cost you.
-[Dick chuckles]

11:49.208 --> 11:50.776
Yep. Somebody was right.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.046
I pulled some old video
of Jason as Robin
and got a hit.

11:54.113 --> 11:57.416
-Got the same walker.
<i>-Can you track him?</i>

11:57.516 --> 11:59.618
He left the Drake restaurant
the night of the shooting.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.754
Went straight to ABC Liquor.

12:01.854 --> 12:04.623
Can you fast forward?
I've got a gala to catch.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.394
[chuckles] Hold on,
Captain Dateless.
Jumping to hyper speed.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.362
[tense music playing]

12:13.065 --> 12:15.468
And we're live.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.205
Last seen at the south end
of Ripley Park.
Ten minutes ago.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.041
Ripley Park? Okay.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.152
Jason!

12:34.487 --> 12:35.888
[motorbike engine revving]

12:43.763 --> 12:44.663
Dick?

12:45.898 --> 12:47.967
[car honking, alarm wailing]

12:48.901 --> 12:50.669
[tense music continues]

13:08.354 --> 13:09.455
Jason.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.267
[Blackfire moaning]

13:41.654 --> 13:44.690
[bed creaking, rattling]

13:46.192 --> 13:47.526
[moans loudly]

13:47.626 --> 13:49.361
[both chuckle]

13:51.297 --> 13:52.898
[both laughing]

13:56.202 --> 13:57.169
[both gasp]

14:00.239 --> 14:01.240
It's not what you think.

14:05.744 --> 14:06.712
Koriand'r?

14:09.181 --> 14:10.850
-[yells]
-[grunts]

14:10.916 --> 14:12.084
What are you doing?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.586
[panting]

14:13.686 --> 14:14.653
I don't know.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.423
You almost cooked me.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.593
I'm sorry, it's, um...

14:20.693 --> 14:23.429
It's happening again.
The visions.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.433
Were they coming from you?

14:27.533 --> 14:34.406
Uh, no, I was, um, sleeping.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.442
Somebody's trying
to tell me something.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.548
-[machine beeping]
-[woman announcing
indistinctly on PA]

14:49.388 --> 14:50.356
Morning, sunshine.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.259
How are you feeling?

14:53.359 --> 14:55.594
[sighs] Like I was
hit by a truck.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.363
How was the gala?

14:58.364 --> 14:59.932
It was amazing.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.100
I danced my ass off.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.135
Liar.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.537
She was here ten minutes
after you came in.

15:05.604 --> 15:06.772
Didn't sleep a wink.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.075
[Dick] Oh.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.610
I'm sorry.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.580
I'd better call home.

15:14.647 --> 15:18.784
I did. Uh, they're worried,
but I told her
I had it covered.

15:20.152 --> 15:22.421
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.590
It's quite the spill you took.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.959
You're lucky the paramedics
got there so quick.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.828
Somebody anonymous
dialed 911.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.332
-I think it was Jason.
-Funny.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.302
I'm not kidding.
He was standing right over me
when I was on the ground.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.338
Babe, you hit your head
pretty hard.

15:39.438 --> 15:43.475
You're saying Jason
was standing over you,
and could have killed you

15:43.575 --> 15:45.177
but called 911 instead?

15:45.277 --> 15:48.580
He must have lost his nerve.
Run out of drugs.
Who knows?

15:50.816 --> 15:52.918
It'll be easier
to finish off now.

15:52.985 --> 15:54.687
Finish?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.589
Bruce used to say,
"Throw water on a drowning man.
Close the deal."

15:59.358 --> 16:03.996
I know that the peaceful way
might not have the same

16:04.096 --> 16:07.433
Batman flourish
that you're looking for.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.102
But if Jason wants
to end this quietly,

16:11.136 --> 16:13.505
we'll do that. Right?

16:15.941 --> 16:17.443
Right.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.846
Yeah.

16:20.946 --> 16:24.950
-How's your head?
-[chuckles softly] It's fine.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.287
Can I get out of here
or what?

16:30.022 --> 16:31.323
Read the sixth line.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.395
Jewelry thief,
police commissioner
and now optometrist.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.530
Humor me.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.802
-E-D-F-C-Z-P.
-Good.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.472
Read the eight line.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.226
D-E-F-P-O-T-E-C.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.598
Is that good enough
for you, Doctor?
Can I go now?

17:12.698 --> 17:13.932
Not quite.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.701
Soon.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.770
Oh, shit.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.838
I think I have an 11 o'clock
with the mayor.

17:19.905 --> 17:21.874
[Dick] You tell him
we're getting close.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.443
We'll wrap this up,
give the city back

17:24.543 --> 17:27.012
Whose city will it be then?

17:27.079 --> 17:30.282
Yours, of course, Commissioner.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.285
All right.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.387
I'll give the mayor
your regards.

17:39.958 --> 17:40.959
Be back in a few hours.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.363
Don't go running off!

17:51.570 --> 17:52.704
Are you sure about this?

17:52.771 --> 17:54.473
Yeah. They worked last time.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.776
Isn't this how Gar ended up,
locked in a trunk
with a black eye?

17:57.876 --> 18:01.080
So he says.
This time I have you two.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.818
Any sign of trouble,
I'm pulling you out.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.653
I'm sorry. I have to slam
you two together on this,

18:07.753 --> 18:09.421
it's just
I could use the backup.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.290
-We work well together.
-No problem.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.059
Do you?

18:14.126 --> 18:16.128
-If we have to.
-I mean... we can.

18:17.996 --> 18:19.231
Okay.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.102
[suspenseful music playing]

18:35.247 --> 18:36.949
[energy crackling]

18:46.291 --> 18:48.494
[gasps softly]

18:53.265 --> 18:54.867
Hello? [echoes]

19:24.530 --> 19:25.898
[woman shouting] My baby!

19:35.174 --> 19:37.209
Hello? [echoes]

19:44.883 --> 19:46.418
[baby cooing]

19:55.227 --> 19:58.730
[chanting indistinctly]

20:06.538 --> 20:08.240
[breathing heavily]

20:14.446 --> 20:15.914
[sighs]

20:18.884 --> 20:20.953
-Kory?
-Hmm?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.421
-Are you awake?
-Yeah.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.124
You guys let me steal
Bruce's car?

20:26.225 --> 20:30.262
We didn't think he'd mind.
I mean, technically,
we've stolen, too.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.598
You got out of that pod thing
and seem to want to drive.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.399
We followed.

20:34.466 --> 20:35.701
Where did I go?

20:35.767 --> 20:37.903
[Conner] You just kept
circling the spot.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.771
-This spot?
-Did you see anything?

20:40.739 --> 20:41.773
Remember anything?

20:41.873 --> 20:43.275
No, no, nothing.

20:44.376 --> 20:45.444
I'll drive you back.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.479
No, it's okay. I'm awake now.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.619
Hey!

20:55.254 --> 20:56.955
So, you two are
sleeping together?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.997
[footsteps receding]

21:05.097 --> 21:06.398
[car door opens]

21:15.941 --> 21:18.076
[shivering]

21:26.451 --> 21:27.986
Hey, what the fuck?

21:28.086 --> 21:29.855
You can't be in here.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.859
Hey man. I don't want
any trouble. Just trying
to find a place to sleep.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.661
Sorry.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.196
It's crazy out there lately.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.199
Regular God-fearing people
killing for no good reason.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.202
Somebody beat you up?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.438
Uh, no, no.

21:46.505 --> 21:49.608
I mean, my friend. Yeah.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.377
Oh, we had a spat...

21:52.477 --> 21:54.112
and, uh, he ran off.

21:54.179 --> 21:56.181
You didn't see anyone
up there, did you?

21:56.281 --> 21:57.316
No, just you.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.885
You hungry?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.888
I got a yogurt cup I was saving
for dessert,

22:04.556 --> 22:05.657
It's pre-stirred.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.061
-You giving that to me?
-Yeah.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.233
Thank you.

22:15.334 --> 22:20.372
Yeah. I wish I could let you
sleep here, but, uh, they're
gonna tear the place down.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.309
[camera shutter clicks]

22:24.376 --> 22:26.244
What are you...
What are you doing?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.246
Final inspection.

22:28.347 --> 22:32.217
No, I mean, what...
What are you taking
a picture of?

22:32.317 --> 22:35.087
Oh, that's for office yucks.

22:35.187 --> 22:39.591
Some moron tried to drill
through a ten foot steel plate
with a concrete drill.

22:39.691 --> 22:40.759
[chuckles]

22:41.326 --> 22:42.427
Ten foot!

22:44.196 --> 22:45.731
Concrete drill.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.866
-What a jag ass!
-[chuckles]

22:47.933 --> 22:52.571
Yeah. You'd be needing
a settling torch the size
of the sun to cut through that.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.407
What the hell?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.677
[Crane] Uh,
I wouldn't touch that.

22:58.744 --> 22:59.611
[man] What?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.113
It could be dangerous.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.048
Yeah.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.016
That's what I'm here for.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.918
To get rid of shit like this.

23:07.018 --> 23:08.253
[camera shutter clicks]

23:10.222 --> 23:12.290
[typing on phone]

23:14.726 --> 23:16.194
[dialing]

23:16.261 --> 23:17.596
[dramatic music playing]

23:18.463 --> 23:19.297
What?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.599
-[neck snaps]
-[groans]

23:20.699 --> 23:22.634
[tense music playing]

23:30.909 --> 23:32.144
[footsteps approaching]

23:33.879 --> 23:34.780
Jason?

24:03.241 --> 24:05.143
[panel squeaking]

24:14.920 --> 24:16.455
Any requests?

24:17.522 --> 24:19.357
[Jason] Requests?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.627
Doggy, wheelbarrow
Magic Mountain.

24:22.694 --> 24:25.297
Magic Mountain's extra,
but it's worth it.

24:27.098 --> 24:28.099
I don't want any of that.

24:29.501 --> 24:30.502
I just want to talk.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.471
You're on the clock.

24:32.537 --> 24:34.673
What do you want to talk about?

24:34.773 --> 24:37.008
I want you to answer
to the name, Hank.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.479
-And you're Dawn.
-So I'm playing a dude.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.381
No, Dawn.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.449
Like the sunrise.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.852
Oh, Dawn.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.221
Okay.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.189
What do you want
to talk about sunshine?

24:52.824 --> 24:55.060
I just want to say,
I'm sorry, Hank.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.862
Don't worry about it.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.296
Shit happens.

24:59.297 --> 25:00.699
For killing you.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.837
Is that supposed to be funny?

25:07.639 --> 25:08.640
No.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.510
Yeah.

25:12.577 --> 25:14.412
I'm not playing this.

25:29.594 --> 25:31.429
I'm sure he had it coming.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.664
[Jason] That's the thing.

25:33.732 --> 25:34.900
He didn't.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.702
Were you high?

25:39.037 --> 25:40.405
It's no excuse.

25:40.505 --> 25:42.707
I've done a lot of
bad things high, too.

25:43.608 --> 25:44.609
A lot of things.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.946
My advice,

25:48.046 --> 25:50.215
there's only one place
they forgive stuff like that.

25:51.449 --> 25:54.286
Home. Time's up, sweetie.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.292
[sighs]

26:02.694 --> 26:03.628
That's all gone.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.599
[cell phone vibrating]

26:13.371 --> 26:16.041
[Dick over phone]
<i>So, they released me?</i>

26:16.107 --> 26:18.043
You could've
at least let me drive you.

26:18.109 --> 26:21.146
Did you do another video sweep
of the accident,
see where Jason went?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.448
Yeah, I did. Last night.

26:23.548 --> 26:26.284
It was like he vanished
into thin air.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.221
Once it's stained,
you'll never look
up there again.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.558
[Barbara]<i> That's what</i>
<i>you said last month.</i>

26:33.625 --> 26:34.726
Said what?

26:34.793 --> 26:35.927
Oh, sorry.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.562
My ceiling.

26:37.629 --> 26:40.065
<i>-You're what?</i>
-I think we have
a structural problem.

26:40.131 --> 26:41.299
You do?

26:41.967 --> 26:43.301
What? Sorry. No.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.570
-Barb?
-[line disconnects]

26:47.272 --> 26:48.306
Barbara?

26:59.117 --> 27:01.419
[somber music playing]

27:07.125 --> 27:09.527
[young Dick] It's all gone.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.863
The old road, the old house.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.332
You're never gonna find them.

27:16.334 --> 27:18.370
Is there a problem?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.941
Oh, sorry.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.282
[engine starts]

27:40.191 --> 27:42.961
[suspenseful music playing]

28:11.423 --> 28:13.825
[cell phone ringing]

28:15.427 --> 28:16.661
Hello?

28:16.728 --> 28:18.596
[on phone]<i> Hey, it's Molly.</i>

28:20.031 --> 28:21.733
[Gar]<i> Jason wants to meet you.</i>

28:21.833 --> 28:23.435
Not Nightwing.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.936
-Alone.
-Where?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.337
Townsend Tunnel. Six o'clock.

28:26.404 --> 28:27.439
He said you know them.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.611
[sighs] Feels like
another set-up.

28:34.579 --> 28:36.781
Uh, we can give you backup.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.916
Be close by.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.451
Tunnels?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.686
Rum runners built them
back in the day.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.054
Bruce used them
as an escape route,

28:43.121 --> 28:45.290
wired them with
cameras and sensors.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.625
Anybody who goes in or out
Jason'll know about it.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.027
That's why he chose them.

28:49.094 --> 28:50.895
I can ask Molly if you'll
meet someplace else.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.530
No.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.132
If it's the tunnels he wants,

28:54.232 --> 28:56.067
it's the tunnels he gets.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.772
It was careless

29:00.872 --> 29:02.974
holing up in my room
for 24 hours,

29:03.074 --> 29:04.609
saying we were sick.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.778
Yeah, I don't get sick,

29:08.046 --> 29:11.416
except for
kryptonite poisoning.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.118
[Connor exhales]

29:13.218 --> 29:14.953
So, what do we do now?

29:16.387 --> 29:18.256
What do you want to do?

29:20.325 --> 29:21.292
I don't know.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.164
We could just
forget the whole thing.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.166
Honestly, we have
nothing in common.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.167
I'm Tamaranean,

29:29.267 --> 29:31.169
and you're some kind of, uh,

29:31.269 --> 29:32.771
genetic cocktail.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.139
I'm not a cocktail.

29:34.239 --> 29:35.473
You know what I mean.

29:35.573 --> 29:36.841
You don't have a mother
and a father.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.276
I know what you mean.

29:42.347 --> 29:43.348
Are you upset?

29:46.584 --> 29:48.286
I can't forget it.

29:49.754 --> 29:51.589
It was my first time.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.858
First...

29:53.958 --> 29:55.293
Tamaranean?

29:57.162 --> 29:58.997
First anyone.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.633
Oh!

30:04.302 --> 30:05.370
Oh.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.176
Hmm.

30:11.276 --> 30:16.014
Well, to be honest with you,
I didn't want to
forget it either

30:17.949 --> 30:22.654
I was just, you know,
trying to give you an out.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.689
An out?

30:24.789 --> 30:28.059
Yeah, I'm the bad
sister, remember?

30:29.861 --> 30:31.396
Men don't usually stick around.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.631
You're not bad.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.503
You're not bad either.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.974
Technically, I am half bad,

30:43.041 --> 30:45.376
but I get what you're saying.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.164
I guess you want to
finish him alone.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.934
Like Batman would have done.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.770
[sighs] I don't know
where you get
these ideas, Tim.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.906
I'm just a regular guy
doing regular things.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.612
I'm actually on
a special investigation

31:20.712 --> 31:21.579
for the GCPD.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.081
Batman used these tunnels.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.850
-Saw him come out once.
-Go home, Tim.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.086
Before you get hurt.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.955
My dad was a cop. Homicide.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.357
A knife and fork man.

31:32.423 --> 31:35.126
Taught me how to investigate
and how to shoot.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.128
I can help you.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.931
I'm sure your dad
is a good man.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.601
I'm gonna find Red Hood
and Scarecrow,

31:43.701 --> 31:45.236
and show you how it's done.

31:46.437 --> 31:49.207
It's not a good idea. Tim...

31:49.274 --> 31:50.408
Tim!

31:59.651 --> 32:02.720
[dramatic music playing]

32:06.157 --> 32:07.091
Jason?

32:21.906 --> 32:23.508
You're not my six o'clock.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.677
[Crane] There was
a cancelation.
They were able to

32:25.777 --> 32:27.512
squeeze me in. Is it okay?

32:27.612 --> 32:30.081
You could have called first.

32:30.148 --> 32:30.982
I just assumed that you

32:31.082 --> 32:33.618
wouldn't pick up, Mom.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.024
After you escaped from Arkham,

32:40.124 --> 32:42.460
I thought you'd leave town.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.662
Leave beautiful Gotham?

32:44.762 --> 32:45.797
Never.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.003
What do you want, Jon?

32:52.103 --> 32:54.472
I want to lay my
head on your lap.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.709
Lap time is over.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.043
[Crane] I've lost steam.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.179
I was hoping maybe you...

33:01.279 --> 33:04.015
You'd give me one of your
classic lectures.

33:04.115 --> 33:07.552
Some tough love. You know,
get the fires relit again.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.822
I'm sorry, but there
is no more love.

33:10.888 --> 33:13.224
No more lectures.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.993
You don't exist to me.

33:17.328 --> 33:21.199
Maybe just some old-fashioned
clinical analysis then.

33:21.299 --> 33:22.834
It's a broken record.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.370
You're afraid to
take risks, Jon.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.006
Loved ones. Career.

33:28.072 --> 33:29.907
Physical confrontation.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.643
So you apply the common
coward's vices.

33:32.710 --> 33:36.180
Drugs, weak friends
to speak for you,

33:36.247 --> 33:37.849
shield you from the world.

33:37.915 --> 33:39.050
You played your part.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.052
What was my part again?

33:41.886 --> 33:43.755
You left.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.923
I deserve better than you.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.493
A new life, a new child.

33:48.559 --> 33:49.727
And I got it.

33:49.827 --> 33:53.164
It doesn't pay to
look backwards.

33:53.231 --> 33:54.999
-[Crane crying]
-Jon?

33:56.601 --> 33:58.836
[breathing heavily]

34:01.706 --> 34:04.509
[continues crying]

34:07.512 --> 34:08.780
I have...

34:11.215 --> 34:13.451
I have terror, Mom.

34:14.352 --> 34:16.354
Terror?

34:16.421 --> 34:18.790
A terror that
I'll fall short again.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.796
Terror that

34:24.896 --> 34:27.298
my ambitions would
be unrealized.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.735
And I see it all...

34:32.904 --> 34:34.639
I see it all laid out

34:34.739 --> 34:36.574
right before me.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.110
And just...

34:40.144 --> 34:42.146
Just as I'm about
to break through,

34:42.246 --> 34:44.482
this dark creature,
this dark creature

34:44.582 --> 34:46.417
just swoops through,

34:46.484 --> 34:48.486
and it just steals
it all away from me.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.490
Does this creature
have a shape?

34:52.590 --> 34:53.724
A color?

34:53.791 --> 34:56.594
-It's just darkness...
-Like Batman.

34:58.162 --> 35:01.766
There is no actual
dark creature, Mom!

35:01.833 --> 35:03.801
It's a fucking metaphor!

35:04.735 --> 35:05.837
No...

35:05.937 --> 35:08.172
No man in a cape.
There's no boy in a mask

35:08.272 --> 35:10.441
that's gonna keep
me from Valhalla!

35:10.508 --> 35:14.145
I am both the dreamer,
and the thief.

35:14.245 --> 35:19.851
Are you unable
to grasp such a simple
psychological concept?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.853
[whimpering] I'm sorry.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.588
I'm sorry.

35:24.522 --> 35:25.756
Sorry.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.833
[tense music playing]

35:39.470 --> 35:41.005
What did you do?

35:41.706 --> 35:43.341
I'm sorry, honey,

35:49.013 --> 35:50.114
I forgive you.

36:03.194 --> 36:06.063
[dramatic music playing]

36:08.533 --> 36:10.801
[Crane] I really thought you
would've come back by now.

36:10.868 --> 36:12.904
But you haven't so...

36:13.004 --> 36:14.872
I mean, I'm all for
a little space, you know?

36:16.174 --> 36:17.575
But you're my prize possession.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.178
I cannot let you out
without a leash.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.847
[tracker beeping]

36:26.050 --> 36:27.852
[young Dick] Bruce!

36:29.086 --> 36:30.521
Bruce!

36:32.390 --> 36:33.925
I can see it now.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.693
I know the way.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.531
[dramatic music playing]

36:45.870 --> 36:46.938
[exhales]

36:49.273 --> 36:50.508
[Jason over intercom]<i> Dick.</i>

36:50.575 --> 36:51.909
Here I am.

36:52.009 --> 36:54.011
<i>Remember these tunnels?</i>

36:54.078 --> 36:55.846
Yep. I do.

36:55.913 --> 36:58.616
<i>Bruce nearly scared me</i>
<i>to death down here.</i>

36:58.716 --> 36:59.951
[Dick]<i> Where are you?</i>

37:00.051 --> 37:02.019
Once I figured out
how to use them though...

37:02.086 --> 37:03.955
<i>they were my ticket out.</i>

37:04.055 --> 37:05.723
I heard you wanted
to talk to me.

37:06.457 --> 37:08.359
<i>Are you alone?</i>

37:08.426 --> 37:10.061
<i>I am. Are you?</i>

37:13.898 --> 37:15.967
Me and Crane are finished.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.802
<i>I'm done killing for him.</i>

37:17.902 --> 37:19.303
How do I know that?

37:19.403 --> 37:20.972
You saw me standing over you.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.041
I could've killed you, Dick.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.476
What do you want?

37:25.576 --> 37:27.078
[Jason]<i> I want to come home.</i>

37:27.144 --> 37:28.613
Be with my friends.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.948
Be a Titan again.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.483
You killed Hank.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.951
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

37:34.051 --> 37:35.987
That was the drugs talking.
Crane talking, too.

37:37.455 --> 37:38.889
But I'm clean now.

37:44.228 --> 37:47.098
You can come home
if you give up Crane.

37:47.164 --> 37:48.933
Live in the house?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.468
[Dick]<i> Right in your old bed.</i>

37:54.171 --> 37:57.241
Meet me at the old Wellington
pump station tonight at 9:00.

38:00.578 --> 38:02.346
-And, Dick?
-[Dick]<i> Yeah.</i>

38:05.449 --> 38:06.417
Thank you.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.153
Of course. You're family.

38:12.256 --> 38:13.991
[Kory]<i> You said</i>
<i>he could do what?</i>

38:14.091 --> 38:15.192
He killed Hank.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.694
He kidnapped kids.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.596
He made that woman
snap her own neck.

38:18.663 --> 38:21.198
So we're just gonna
set an extra place
at the dinner table?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.000
"Oh, hey, J,
pass the mashed potatoes."

38:23.100 --> 38:25.670
He's offering
to turn himself in
and bring in Crane.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.038
This is bullshit.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.839
You're forgiving a murderer.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.341
We need Crane.

38:30.441 --> 38:32.443
Hold on.
What if all the killing
was Scarecrow?

38:32.510 --> 38:34.045
No. He needs
to be held accountable.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.714
You didn't hold me accountable
when Cadmus took me over,

38:36.814 --> 38:38.382
made me a killer.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.885
You guys all took me back,

38:40.985 --> 38:41.786
no questions asked,

38:41.852 --> 38:43.554
because we're family.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.823
Jason deserves the same chance.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.164
All right.
We bring them both in,

38:53.230 --> 38:55.032
and after that we assess
the situation.

38:55.132 --> 38:58.169
I've never met the guy,
but I'm bullish
on second chances.

39:01.539 --> 39:02.840
Batcave, five minutes.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.375
Hey.

39:05.876 --> 39:07.678
I can't believe you,

39:07.745 --> 39:11.749
Bruce said be a better Batman
and there are two versions
of that.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.719
One kills, one doesn't.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.156
We should go.

[gasps] Tim.

41:56.881 --> 41:58.682
Hey, what are you doing here?

41:58.749 --> 42:00.150
I followed you.

42:00.217 --> 42:01.252
Why?

42:01.352 --> 42:02.253
[Tim] I want...

42:03.387 --> 42:04.855
to be Robin.

There's someone
on the ground.

[Nightwing] Tim!

42:25.743 --> 42:27.177
[Nightwing] Conner.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.346
Looks like the bullet
went clean through.

42:29.413 --> 42:30.848
Somebody call an ambulance.

42:30.915 --> 42:32.249
I'm on it.

42:32.349 --> 42:34.184
I need something
to stop the bleeding.

42:34.251 --> 42:35.085
[gasping]

42:40.257 --> 42:42.793
He's got blood in his lungs,
he's gonna drown.

Paramedics are on their way.
Three minutes, tops,

[gasps softly]

42:51.569 --> 42:52.770
Dick? You all right?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.074
Yeah, I'm okay.

42:58.375 --> 42:59.810
Kory and I
will go in this way.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.378
-We'll go around back.
-[Nightwing] Stay here, Gar.

43:08.419 --> 43:09.320
Jason!

43:29.773 --> 43:32.343
You're too afraid to take
any real risks, Jon.

43:35.145 --> 43:36.313
Fuck you, Mom.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.950
[Crane yells like a banshee]

43:40.017 --> 43:41.085
[Nightwing] No. Wait!

43:45.322 --> 43:48.359
[computer beeping]

43:48.459 --> 43:50.194
There's been
an explosion downtown.

The old pump station
