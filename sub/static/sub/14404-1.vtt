01:26.270 --> 01:28.313
Hey, kiddo, what are you doing?

01:28.397 --> 01:31.566
I buy you a fancy Mexican meal
and you're feeding it to a mutt.

01:31.650 --> 01:32.859
Real fancy.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.987
You have any idea what that is?

01:37.031 --> 01:38.573
- What?
- Tree chicken.

01:38.824 --> 01:40.783
- What?
- That's what the locals call it.

01:41.952 --> 01:44.746
Colds, headaches, hangovers,
cures anything.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.540
Iguana. That's what they say.

01:48.125 --> 01:53.338
What about indigestion?
Fuckin' iguana taco.

01:56.008 --> 01:57.425
Yeah, well, you had it in Salvador.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.552
Yeah, and that was shit.

02:00.471 --> 02:02.639
What about Angola?
The food was good there, right?

02:02.723 --> 02:03.723
Shit.

02:04.016 --> 02:06.184
- Yeah, Rhodesia?
- Shit.

02:06.268 --> 02:07.393
- Hamburg?
- Shit.

02:08.604 --> 02:09.812
So if it's not New York, it's...

02:09.896 --> 02:10.937
You got it. Shit.

02:11.023 --> 02:13.066
Look at you wasting away.

02:13.609 --> 02:15.401
We got to get a job in New York.

02:15.486 --> 02:18.488
That won't be a problem.
Plenty of assholes there.

02:20.324 --> 02:22.075
Time to move, kiddo.

02:47.893 --> 02:49.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.558
Fuck!

05:02.069 --> 05:03.069
Stay down!

05:10.410 --> 05:11.577
Stay down, kid.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.889
- What happened?
- There was a kid in the car.

05:31.974 --> 05:33.182
- What?
- There was a kid in the car.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.934
- Go, go, go, go!
- Fuck!

05:49.700 --> 05:53.119
I'm done with this. I'm finished.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.123
I can't do this anymore.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.669
I can't do this.

07:04.942 --> 07:06.901
Oh, shit!

07:18.205 --> 07:19.205
Shit!

07:41.228 --> 07:42.395
Danny, get in.

07:42.479 --> 07:45.481
These camel jockeys have got diseases
I don't wanna think about.

07:45.565 --> 07:46.607
Where is he?

07:46.692 --> 07:47.775
The client still has him.

07:47.859 --> 07:48.901
What client?

07:49.444 --> 07:50.903
We're going there now.

07:52.864 --> 07:53.906
Okay, drive.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.374
So the client's an oil sheikh, no less.

08:03.792 --> 08:07.211
He used to rule some huge stretch of desert
till his tribe kicked him out.

08:07.629 --> 08:09.839
Been living here in exile ever since.

08:10.132 --> 08:13.342
Anyway, Sheikhy was loaded
and he wanted a job done.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.053
Hunter took the contract, then he ran.

08:16.138 --> 08:17.847
They caught him at the airport.

08:19.599 --> 08:21.058
And?

08:21.143 --> 08:23.227
You know the rest.
You got the package.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.230
Yeah, I got it.

08:27.649 --> 08:28.691
What's the job?

08:28.775 --> 08:30.234
Just came with a price tag, no details.

08:30.318 --> 08:31.986
Hunter took it cold.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.486
Why would he do that?

08:33.572 --> 08:34.947
Six million dollars.

08:35.365 --> 08:36.407
A big score, Danny.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.616
Too bloody big for Hunter.

08:38.702 --> 08:39.702
Yeah.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.037
Why'd you offer it to him?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.746
He wanted the money.

08:42.831 --> 08:44.582
And you were out, remember?

08:45.042 --> 08:46.584
Yeah. Still am.

08:48.754 --> 08:49.712
I'm done with killing.

08:49.796 --> 08:52.089
Yeah, well, maybe killing
ain't done with you.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.593
Hunter needs the old Danny,
the best in the biz.

08:55.677 --> 08:58.345
The one with balls of steel.
You remember him, right?

08:59.306 --> 09:01.140
Look, it comes down to this.

09:01.433 --> 09:04.685
You don't do this job,
Hunter's a dead man.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.694
They're waiting for you.

10:01.576 --> 10:02.576
This way.

10:04.079 --> 10:06.288
He's waiting for his eyes to adjust.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.709
Be careful around this one, boy.

10:13.922 --> 10:16.507
My son forgets the ways of the desert.

10:17.259 --> 10:21.011
Since our war against the Sultan,
all he has had of his homeland

10:21.096 --> 10:24.348
is this paint. Plaster.

10:26.143 --> 10:29.520
My first son, Hussain,
was slaughtered here.

10:34.943 --> 10:36.402
Shot before his children.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.698
And here, at the Battle of Mirbat,

10:40.782 --> 10:43.742
<i>his brother, Salim,
was wounded and then killed.</i>

10:45.537 --> 10:46.579
Murdered.

10:50.208 --> 10:54.170
And then my third son
was taken from me. Ali.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.426
<i>Hunted down and slaughtered.</i>

11:03.263 --> 11:05.848
The law of the desert
says the blood of the victim

11:05.932 --> 11:08.601
must be washed away
by the blood of the killers.

11:09.311 --> 11:13.647
But I refused revenge and saved my last son,
Bakhait, from the war.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.775
So I was exiled to this desert.

11:18.153 --> 11:20.946
I have wealth, power.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.908
But rich men die, too.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.413
When I die, I want Bakhait
to go home to my tribe.

11:30.332 --> 11:33.459
But for that to happen,
the killers of my sons must be killed.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.755
You don't need me or Hunter for this.

11:37.839 --> 11:39.256
You got all the men you need.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.800
What use would my men be in England?

11:43.011 --> 11:44.011
England?

11:46.598 --> 11:50.476
The English sent their fiercest dogs
to kill for the Sultan's oil.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.355
- The SAS?
- Yes.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.690
Their glorious special forces.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.818
- It was a war.
- It was not England's war.

12:00.237 --> 12:04.907
They came to my land, murdered my sons,
now they will face my law.

12:06.868 --> 12:09.203
The doctors say I have six months
left to live.

12:10.413 --> 12:12.748
You must avenge my sons before I die

12:12.832 --> 12:14.833
or your friend will die with me.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.044
I don't care how you kill the killers.

12:17.629 --> 12:20.297
But they will admit their guilt on tape,

12:20.382 --> 12:23.550
and their deaths must look like accidents.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.053
This must not lead back to my son.

12:27.180 --> 12:33.936
So go, show the English a war isn't over
till both sides say it is.

12:35.563 --> 12:36.814
I wanna see Hunter.

12:53.164 --> 12:55.708
Oh, Danny!

12:55.792 --> 12:58.961
No, Danny. No, no, no, no. No.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.755
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.592
You all right?

13:05.677 --> 13:07.094
Am I all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.847
You gotta go. Get away from here.
Go, go, go, go.

13:09.931 --> 13:11.473
I'm not here for you anyway.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.892
I was thinking about the girls and Celine.

13:14.352 --> 13:15.519
Me, too. Me, too.

13:17.138 --> 13:18.564
What's that supposed to mean?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.233
It's tough putting food on the table.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.778
What you feeding 'em?
Six million, no questions?

13:24.988 --> 13:26.030
Well.

13:26.114 --> 13:27.865
So you must've known
that was a bullshit job.

13:27.949 --> 13:28.991
Yeah, I knew.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.243
Fuckin' SAS, a one-way ticket for sure.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.122
Well, you took the job,
and I'm not leaving you here.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.252
Hey!

13:43.923 --> 13:45.174
Give this man a drink.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.887
- I missed you.
- I didn't miss you.

13:49.971 --> 13:53.432
Every day you were out of this game
was a good day for me.

13:53.516 --> 13:55.017
I was proud of you when you got out.

13:56.936 --> 13:57.978
Stay out.

13:58.063 --> 13:59.104
Too late.

14:01.232 --> 14:02.524
You should have stayed away.

14:04.903 --> 14:05.944
Or run faster.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.169
Son of a bitch!

15:04.963 --> 15:08.006
- What are you doing?
- Let me get my watch back.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.201
Go, go!

15:38.037 --> 15:39.037
Go!

15:50.383 --> 15:51.508
Go, go, get the door!

15:52.594 --> 15:53.760
Get the door!

16:05.190 --> 16:06.607
Give me the gun.

16:16.075 --> 16:21.038
Bravo! Bravo!
If you need to be shot, I'll happily oblige.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.460
I'm sorry, kiddo.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.295
My father needs him alive.

16:34.552 --> 16:36.970
Nice try. You know they'd have found you.

16:42.644 --> 16:43.727
Everybody gets found.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.025
You knew.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.945
My gut tells me you knew the target
and you knew Hunter wouldn't take it.

16:53.321 --> 16:54.571
You used him as bait.

16:54.656 --> 16:56.281
That's a lot of angles, Danny.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.075
Do you think I'm that smart?

16:59.953 --> 17:03.956
Get out. And you. Out.

17:28.898 --> 17:30.315
<i>We missed you at the dance last night.</i>

17:31.859 --> 17:33.485
I'm not much of a dancer.

17:33.570 --> 17:36.780
Besides, I'm still trying to find out
how much house is under this.

17:36.864 --> 17:40.033
- Right, big plans.
- Yeah, maybe too big.

17:48.209 --> 17:49.418
You don't remember me, do you?

17:50.628 --> 17:52.796
Yeah, well, it's been a while.

17:55.258 --> 17:57.384
I'm Anne Frazer.

18:01.639 --> 18:03.223
Anne Frazer?

18:03.349 --> 18:06.018
- Anne had red hair full of grass.
- Yeah.

18:06.144 --> 18:07.644
And weird red gumboots.

18:07.729 --> 18:09.062
With eyes on them.

18:09.447 --> 18:10.480
Oh, my God!

18:29.082 --> 18:31.543
You owe me 50 quid.
Told you he'd be back, didn't I?

18:35.048 --> 18:36.882
- We missed you.
- Yeah?

18:38.259 --> 18:39.760
Here I am.

18:39.844 --> 18:41.261
All right, then, you want some?

18:46.851 --> 18:49.144
Yeah, mate, you still got it.
Still got that edge.

18:49.228 --> 18:50.562
You're a real killer.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.827
Come on, let's talk.

18:58.946 --> 19:01.490
While you were away,
you didn't start a family, did you?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.699
No.

19:02.784 --> 19:04.034
So no one's depending on you?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.953
Only Hunter.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.083
'Cause one, you're going after the SAS.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.710
They're a paranoid bunch.
They always got their back up.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.298
Two, you need info on Oman.
No one talks about Oman.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.052
They went in there as advisors and ended up
fighting the fucking war. Real hush-hush,

19:22.136 --> 19:23.553
semi-mercenary stuff.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.555
Three, you need confessions.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.307
They're trained to resist torture

19:27.392 --> 19:29.434
so no matter what you say or do,
they'll say nothing.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.769
And four, Danny,

19:31.229 --> 19:33.438
this is the best special forces regiment
in the world.

19:33.523 --> 19:35.607
They make the Navy Seals
look like a bunch of cupcakes.

19:35.692 --> 19:39.695
And not only that, you're trying
to take down three of their geezers

19:39.779 --> 19:40.904
and make it look like an accident.

19:41.739 --> 19:44.449
All I'm asking is give it some thought.

19:44.534 --> 19:45.617
Take a day, more if you want.

19:45.702 --> 19:47.119
I'm going anyway.

19:49.038 --> 19:52.207
Of course I'm in, you silly bastard.
It's what we do, right?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.376
Anyway, I've got a score to settle with them.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.294
Tried out for them
when I was in the Paras.

19:56.379 --> 19:57.796
Did Hereford, the whole fucking lot.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.548
What, and they wouldn't have you?

20:00.991 --> 20:03.009
You want this bottle shoved up your arse?

20:03.553 --> 20:06.346
- Are you upset? Would you like a lolly?
- I'd love a lolly.

20:06.431 --> 20:07.889
Strawberry or fuck you?

20:08.015 --> 20:09.182
Meier.

20:10.184 --> 20:11.226
In.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.853
Why?

20:13.537 --> 20:16.314
Six million reasons.
So what's the split?

20:17.316 --> 20:21.153
After the Agent takes his slice,
50-50 between you two.

20:21.237 --> 20:23.280
50-50? How about you?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.740
I'm in this for Hunter.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.158
How wonderfully touching.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.826
Touching, but fuckin' stupid.

20:30.413 --> 20:32.080
The Sheikh could only ID
one of the killers.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.916
I need you to come up
with the names on the other two.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.252
Start with the one they killed at Mirbat.

20:37.336 --> 20:40.213
So the one target we do have
is Steven Douglas Harris.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.132
Stayed on in Oman after the war.

20:42.216 --> 20:44.676
Ended up flying choppers
for the Sultan's armed forces.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.052
Great. A juice junkie.

20:46.721 --> 20:48.138
Me and Meier'll head there
to track him down.

20:49.265 --> 20:52.225
Boys? Danny. Meier.

21:06.991 --> 21:08.200
What the fuck!

21:14.540 --> 21:15.540
Harris!

21:17.293 --> 21:18.543
Harris, you prick!

21:19.462 --> 21:20.504
Fuck off!

21:26.260 --> 21:29.095
Well, I hope the buggers
like sand in their burgers, huh?

21:34.685 --> 21:36.144
White Range Rover coming your way.

21:36.729 --> 21:37.729
<i>It's Harris.</i>

22:00.920 --> 22:01.962
What are you doing?

22:04.799 --> 22:06.007
- Come on, have a go.
- No.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.092
- Come on.
- I'm not.

22:07.176 --> 22:08.260
Have a go. Look.

22:08.344 --> 22:11.096
Just aim and shoot.
Go! Here we go!

22:14.433 --> 22:16.101
- Oh, you horny git!
- Come on.

22:16.185 --> 22:17.435
- No.
- Come on.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.104
Come on.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.260
All right, ladies, you can throw your knickers
if you want.

23:32.345 --> 23:34.721
Go on, you cheeky bugger!

23:36.098 --> 23:38.141
- You serve in Oman?
- At Mirbat.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.018
That was a day, wasn't it?

23:40.102 --> 23:41.904
What about Mirbat?
That was a right mess.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.397
- Wasn't good.
- I had a mate there.

23:55.159 --> 23:58.036
- Spike, get that quick.
- Yeah, all right, all right.

24:01.832 --> 24:02.832
Bollocks.

24:03.668 --> 24:05.752
- Hello?
- <i>Spikey, it's Bazza.</i>

24:05.836 --> 24:09.506
God's sake! I'm unplugging that bloody thing
next time, and I mean it.

24:10.424 --> 24:12.634
Yeah, I'm onto this bloke here, right.

24:12.718 --> 24:16.262
He was in the Bear earlier pumping
some SAS lads for info on Mirbat.

24:16.806 --> 24:17.973
Mirbat. And?

24:18.057 --> 24:19.766
He says he's Welsh.
But he don't sound it.

24:20.601 --> 24:22.352
I don't know.
Maybe I'm being a bit paranoid, but...

24:22.436 --> 24:23.687
Hey, just 'cause you're being paranoid,

24:23.771 --> 24:26.398
doesn't mean to say
they're not out to get you.

24:27.441 --> 24:30.568
All right, mate,
give me what you've got.

24:31.112 --> 24:33.071
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Put one of my Locals onto him.

25:02.810 --> 25:06.938
The Omani Embassy.
Our Local followed him into the visa section.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.859
Says he's Welsh, calls himself Mr. Jones.

25:11.444 --> 25:12.944
We lost him after he left.

25:13.029 --> 25:14.279
Lost him? How come?

25:14.613 --> 25:16.698
He never came back to his car. Stolen.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.617
Anyhow, he flies to Oman in four days.

25:19.702 --> 25:22.704
I'd like permission to send one of my boys
out there to tail him.

25:22.788 --> 25:25.373
This was definitely some kind of recce.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.626
That was a dirty war.
What we did there was questionable.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.879
Oman is a bloody hornet's nest.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.839
Right. And if this bugger is poking at it,

25:32.923 --> 25:35.133
I want to know who he is.
I say we send a Local.

25:35.217 --> 25:36.342
Any objections?

25:37.303 --> 25:39.471
Noted. We'll leave you
to choose the right man.

25:39.722 --> 25:42.974
I'd also like it noted
that we are ex-SAS.

25:43.350 --> 25:45.268
The men we protect are ex-SAS.

25:45.352 --> 25:49.147
And you, Spike, though you hate
to admit it, are ex-SAS.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.233
Remember, we're businessmen and bankers now.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.110
What we do here is illegal.

25:54.695 --> 25:57.405
We can leave no trace of our activities.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.115
That's why we're called The Feather Men,

26:00.284 --> 26:03.161
'cause our touch is light.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.791
<i>Now, Spike's a good man.</i>

26:07.875 --> 26:10.210
<i>Day the SAS lost him,
they lost a good soldier.</i>

26:10.586 --> 26:13.379
<i>Yes, but the problem is he thinks
he's still in the SAS.</i>

26:13.464 --> 26:15.173
Well, someone has to do the dirty work.

26:15.424 --> 26:17.300
None of us want blood on our pinstripes.

26:17.384 --> 26:22.680
Listen, I've got no problem with blood.
What worries me is ink.

26:23.557 --> 26:25.975
<i>Make sure he keeps us
out of the newspapers.</i>

26:26.060 --> 26:27.102
What's doing, boss?

26:27.186 --> 26:28.603
Your Arabic's still good, right?

26:28.687 --> 26:30.230
- Good enough.
- You're going to Oman.

26:30.314 --> 26:32.023
I've got a bloke I want you
to tail out there.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.653
You lucky bastard!

26:48.249 --> 26:49.874
You know what? You're gorgeous.

26:51.752 --> 26:52.961
Where are you staying?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.295
I'm staying at the Hilton.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.507
As a matter of fact, so am I.
What room are you in?

26:58.008 --> 27:00.051
- Why? Would you like to know?
- Love to.

27:00.845 --> 27:02.345
You are smooth.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.653
What are we doing out here, then,
in the middle of nowhere?

27:18.737 --> 27:20.321
Well, I ask him to go hide it,
he hides it.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.448
Could've been your asshole,
consider yourself lucky.

27:22.867 --> 27:24.534
Shut it, Meier.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.578
Appreciate it, thank you.

27:33.002 --> 27:35.545
These tiles are an exact match
to the shower step?

27:36.172 --> 27:37.172
Hundred percent.

27:37.548 --> 27:40.091
Harris comes home, parks the car.
It's been a hard day.

27:40.176 --> 27:41.401
I'll have a shower.

27:41.886 --> 27:45.722
He slips on the shampoo,
hits the corner of the step with his occiput.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.141
- Case closed.
- Get out of it.

27:48.559 --> 27:50.643
You boys are going about this all wrong.

27:50.728 --> 27:52.270
That bird he's screwing is married.

27:53.355 --> 27:55.857
Why don't we just pop 'em both
and make it look like her husband did it.

27:55.941 --> 28:00.445
Pop 'em both? What's she ever done?
It's Harris we're after.

28:01.947 --> 28:02.947
Poor bastard.

28:03.782 --> 28:06.576
Ten years after the war, he cops it
for doing something he was ordered to do.

28:06.994 --> 28:08.536
He knew what he was doing
when he joined the club.

28:08.829 --> 28:10.788
- Yeah, what club?
- The killing club.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.000
- It could be you or me.
- Yeah, but it's not...

28:14.293 --> 28:16.127
I'm just glad I never killed a raghead.

28:16.921 --> 28:18.046
No offense, my son.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.297
Let's get this done.

28:19.882 --> 28:22.383
Excuse my friend.
He's a royal asshole.

28:32.228 --> 28:33.269
Shit!

28:41.153 --> 28:43.988
Where's he gonna run?
It's the middle of the fuckin' desert.

28:46.867 --> 28:47.992
Son of a...

28:56.085 --> 28:59.671
Meier, cut him off at the next shaft!
Let's go, let's go.

29:05.552 --> 29:06.552
Where is he?

29:49.013 --> 29:51.097
Let's get out here. Fuckin' hell!

29:57.521 --> 29:59.230
So what, now somebody's on our ass?

29:59.315 --> 30:00.523
We should move right away.

30:00.607 --> 30:02.442
We'll set up Harris' interview for tomorrow.

30:02.735 --> 30:04.861
Davies, you make sure his girl doesn't show.

30:04.945 --> 30:06.195
She has nothing to do with this.

30:24.340 --> 30:25.923
Wanker!

30:35.851 --> 30:38.561
We're military historians.
I'll do the talking, all right?

30:40.022 --> 30:41.981
Well, it's 5:00 somewhere, isn't it?

30:42.691 --> 30:45.068
So where's this documentary
gonna be shown, then?

30:45.152 --> 30:46.152
On the telly?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.450
The chair.

30:54.203 --> 30:55.862
Those bastards in C Company
put this together?

31:24.316 --> 31:26.317
What's the matter?
They didn't like sand in their burgers?

31:27.945 --> 31:31.155
Hello, boys.
I'm not saying a word till I see my lawyer.

31:31.782 --> 31:34.117
Think back. The village of Qum.

31:34.701 --> 31:36.786
You killed a guerilla commander.

31:37.204 --> 31:40.623
His name was Hussain bin Amr.
Do you admit it?

31:46.171 --> 31:47.338
Fuck off!

31:47.881 --> 31:49.132
You're kidding, right?

31:49.216 --> 31:50.716
You commanded a company there.

31:54.555 --> 31:55.847
Yeah, I led a company on that op, sure.

31:56.181 --> 31:59.851
And you assassinated Hussain bin Amr.
There were witnesses.

32:01.437 --> 32:03.354
You dropped him in front of his family.

32:08.152 --> 32:10.571
All right, you got me. I did it.

32:11.780 --> 32:14.740
Fuck you! Good one.
Now untie me.

32:15.576 --> 32:16.701
Get up.

32:17.578 --> 32:18.870
Hey! Piss off!

32:20.330 --> 32:21.372
We have what we need.

32:23.208 --> 32:26.252
What if I told you somebody else
dropped your guerilla commander?

32:27.880 --> 32:28.921
His name is...

32:29.965 --> 32:31.549
I can't remember.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.052
But he's writing a book
about the whole Oman gig.

32:35.137 --> 32:36.929
You might find it in there.

32:37.639 --> 32:38.723
If you could read.

32:39.766 --> 32:40.808
To the bathroom.

32:41.685 --> 32:44.270
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

32:44.354 --> 32:46.481
It's coming back to me,
looking at your fucking face.

32:46.607 --> 32:51.777
His name is Captain R. Sole!
A-R-S-E H-O-L-E.

32:51.862 --> 32:53.905
- Shut up.
- You're fucking dead, yeah?

32:54.698 --> 32:55.781
On your knees.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.911
Fucking queers!
Serves you fucking right!

33:01.413 --> 33:03.664
- Head down.
- Get your fuckin' hands off me, you queer!

33:04.041 --> 33:05.708
- You're fuckin' kidding me.
- Hold him still.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.461
If I find you, I'll put your fuckin' head
in the toilet bowl.

33:08.545 --> 33:09.587
Poor fucker.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.265
Jay!

33:22.017 --> 33:26.103
I need money for the taxi.
I had to take a taxi. I had a flat.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.246
Fuck you!

33:53.131 --> 33:54.131
Case closed.

34:03.809 --> 34:04.850
Thank you.

34:10.815 --> 34:13.693
<i>...tells of a dramatic 12-hour
rescue operation</i>

34:13.777 --> 34:15.820
<i>to save the crew of Radio Caroline.</i>

34:16.112 --> 34:17.905
<i>The pirate radio ship sank the...</i>

34:21.159 --> 34:23.578
It seems your friend did what you couldn't.

34:26.123 --> 34:27.498
Wouldn't.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.916
Wouldn't, couldn't.

34:29.626 --> 34:31.002
He's avenged Hussain.

34:31.085 --> 34:32.503
Good news for the old man,
not for you.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.505
What do you mean?

34:34.590 --> 34:36.841
Three brothers dead.
Rotting in the sand.

34:38.427 --> 34:40.177
You didn't wanna get revenge yourself?

34:40.846 --> 34:42.554
Scared of getting your hands dirty?

34:43.931 --> 34:45.433
Better get used to it.

34:46.059 --> 34:49.020
No palace where you're going.
A tent and a hole to shit in.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.565
He's your worst nightmare
and he's gonna do it.

34:55.110 --> 34:57.069
And when he does, you're out of here.

34:58.030 --> 35:02.283
When I find you in that desert,
I pray God keeps my aim...

35:06.121 --> 35:07.538
true.

35:22.012 --> 35:23.137
Well, what do you think?

35:23.221 --> 35:24.263
Yeah, it's coming along.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.729
What are you doing
for New Year's Eve dinner?

35:32.689 --> 35:33.814
Oh, shit!

35:40.405 --> 35:41.530
Bollocks!

35:44.785 --> 35:47.578
Strangers are a bit of an exotic thing
around here.

35:47.663 --> 35:49.538
Oh, come on, I didn't think I was a stranger.

35:49.623 --> 35:51.082
I know, but you're still exotic.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.919
Danny, something tells me
you've got a story to tell.

35:56.213 --> 35:57.213
Yeah.

36:09.059 --> 36:10.643
Come on, what are you waiting for?

36:11.103 --> 36:12.103
Party's outside.

36:13.438 --> 36:15.147
Happy New Year!

36:19.444 --> 36:20.903
Happy New Year!

36:22.447 --> 36:24.031
It's a tradition around here.

36:25.033 --> 36:26.283
Happy New Year!

36:52.602 --> 36:54.019
Shit!

37:10.245 --> 37:12.246
Mirbat. The artist's name is on the back.

37:13.790 --> 37:15.332
Have them talk to him.

37:16.710 --> 37:18.002
One more thing.

37:18.086 --> 37:20.921
My boys had some trouble in Oman.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.173
Somebody was tailing them.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.425
We'll have to have a look into that,
won't we?

37:26.136 --> 37:27.136
Yeah.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.191
- That's how you get it so lifelike, then.
- Sorry?

37:40.650 --> 37:43.527
Photos of the lads.
Isn't that like cheating?

37:43.737 --> 37:46.822
I'm recreating an historical event.
Accuracy is everything.

37:48.283 --> 37:50.743
That Mirbat painting stopped me cold
when I saw it.

37:50.827 --> 37:51.827
You were at Mirbat?

37:51.912 --> 37:53.037
Had a mate there.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.831
I was hoping you might have
an address for him.

37:55.916 --> 37:57.458
- You're with the SAS?
- Was.

37:59.127 --> 38:01.504
Then your best bet for an address
would be Regimental Association...

38:01.588 --> 38:03.297
They won't talk to me.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.883
Spent the last few years
plying my trade overseas.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.259
Angola and that.

38:07.636 --> 38:09.345
I come to you unofficial like.

38:12.849 --> 38:15.893
Well, I might have something somewhere.

38:17.187 --> 38:18.270
Just give me a few minutes.

38:18.355 --> 38:19.563
Be my guest.

38:34.329 --> 38:36.080
I got a bullshitter askin' about Mirbat.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.666
Yeah. He claims he's with the regiment.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.417
No, there's no way he was SAS.

38:41.086 --> 38:44.588
Yeah, I can smell it off him.
He's a bloody fake.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.948
My contact says the call was cut off,

39:11.032 --> 39:13.868
but Gowling said that there was somebody there
asking about Mirbat.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.703
It has to be our guy.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.663
And what would you have us do about it?

39:17.747 --> 39:18.998
Find him.

39:19.082 --> 39:22.209
If we don't, there's gonna be another murder
and it will be one of our Mirbat boys.

39:22.294 --> 39:23.627
Then who are they?

39:23.712 --> 39:25.004
Well, they're pros for sure.

39:25.589 --> 39:26.881
If these guys are going after the SAS,

39:26.965 --> 39:29.133
they're gonna be top-class
professional assassins.

39:29.551 --> 39:31.552
They must have a string of hits behind them

39:31.636 --> 39:33.637
but they're completely under the radar.

39:34.306 --> 39:35.389
All we've got is Oman.

39:35.599 --> 39:36.599
Oman?

39:36.683 --> 39:38.183
We all know our people went too far.

39:38.518 --> 39:41.228
Oman, Mirbat.
It all needs to be left alone.

39:41.313 --> 39:42.813
You should try telling that
to the Welshman.

39:44.733 --> 39:46.066
He's right.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.986
We have to find this phony Welshman
and his group.

39:51.448 --> 39:53.032
The file says an SAS officer

39:53.116 --> 39:54.992
killed the Sheikh's son
at the Battle of Mirbat.

39:56.244 --> 39:57.661
Warrick Steven Cregg.

39:57.871 --> 40:00.915
He was the only officer there that night.
Killed everything that moved.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.958
He's our worst nightmare.
A real hotshot.

40:03.043 --> 40:04.293
Paintings of him, the lot.

40:04.377 --> 40:05.586
Where did you get this?

40:05.712 --> 40:07.546
The bloke who did the paintings.

40:09.341 --> 40:10.591
Don't you worry about that, all right?

40:10.675 --> 40:11.884
He's shuffled off this mortal coil.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.385
That wasn't part of the deal.

40:13.470 --> 40:16.513
Come on, shit happens when you play
in the deep end of the pool, Danny.

40:16.598 --> 40:19.224
Why couldn't you two
stick to the plan, huh?

40:21.227 --> 40:23.520
You've been watching this Cregg,
what's your next big idea?

40:24.022 --> 40:25.356
His wife's in hospital.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.358
<i>When he's not training
for the selection march,</i>

40:27.442 --> 40:28.734
<i>he spends most days there.</i>

40:29.110 --> 40:30.110
<i>So why don't we hit him there?</i>

40:30.654 --> 40:32.321
<i>No. Not near his family.</i>

40:32.864 --> 40:34.365
<i>Get me everything you know
on that march.</i>

40:34.616 --> 40:36.200
<i>We'll see where that goes.</i>

40:48.672 --> 40:50.172
Okay, so,

40:50.799 --> 40:52.925
there's only four Mirbat survivors in Britain.

40:53.009 --> 40:54.468
I've got Locals on the other three.

40:55.011 --> 40:56.929
You get the celebrity.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.263
Warrick Cregg?

40:58.390 --> 40:59.390
You're kidding.

41:00.016 --> 41:01.100
Wish I was.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.981
Welcome to hell,
the SAS selection march.

41:07.273 --> 41:09.900
Forty-one miles, fifty-five pounds of gear.

41:09.985 --> 41:11.860
They lose someone every couple of years.

41:14.239 --> 41:15.322
Don't you even think about it.

41:16.408 --> 41:17.366
Why not?

41:17.450 --> 41:19.743
During the march this place
is crawling with SAS.

41:20.161 --> 41:22.913
Yeah, you said it yourself.
It's an accident waiting to happen.

41:23.873 --> 41:25.332
How are you gonna catch him then?

41:25.417 --> 41:28.168
He's been training for months,
he's like a greyhound.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.586
We'll just have to slow him down,
won't we?

41:32.257 --> 41:34.967
Insulin. Chlorpropamide.

41:36.177 --> 41:37.469
Initial here.

41:46.438 --> 41:47.438
Anything doing?

41:47.564 --> 41:49.606
No, Cregg's still in there
with his missus.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.903
- Here, boss, this will keep you going.
- Cheers.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.931
Pennock. I need you back here, mate. Pronto.

43:27.539 --> 43:28.539
Get out of the fucking way!

43:35.672 --> 43:36.672
Maniac!

46:42.859 --> 46:45.444
You wouldn't fucking believe it,
somebody was watching Cregg.

46:45.570 --> 46:46.570
What?

46:47.155 --> 46:49.239
You think he's from the same stable
as the shooter in the desert?

46:49.657 --> 46:51.033
Maybe. He was good.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.909
Whoever he is, he's too late.

46:53.536 --> 46:54.536
Good, good.

46:55.663 --> 46:57.331
Chroma slows him down.

46:57.498 --> 46:58.665
Insulin

46:59.584 --> 47:01.460
sends him into shock.

47:02.670 --> 47:03.670
Hypothermia to you.

47:04.088 --> 47:05.505
And when were you planning
on getting it to him?

47:05.590 --> 47:07.215
Before the march.

47:07.300 --> 47:08.300
How?

47:08.551 --> 47:09.926
It's an SAS base, Danny.

47:10.011 --> 47:11.428
That you trained in.

47:12.347 --> 47:14.806
So think back.
The security layout, the lot.

47:18.144 --> 47:19.144
You're nuts.

47:19.562 --> 47:20.812
Are you gonna do it?

47:21.606 --> 47:24.232
Man, you really are one
crazy son of a bitch, Danny.

47:40.500 --> 47:42.667
Clock's ticking.
You've got under a minute, all right?

47:56.391 --> 47:57.516
We've got company.

48:05.316 --> 48:06.316
Lovely night.

48:06.401 --> 48:07.984
You can't stop here, mate.

48:08.069 --> 48:09.236
I didn't stop, the truck did.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.654
If you don't fucking move it, we will.

48:10.738 --> 48:12.572
All right, all right.
But it's pissing oil, mate.

48:12.657 --> 48:13.824
There's nothing I can do about it.

48:13.908 --> 48:15.158
Turn off the bloody radio.

49:02.039 --> 49:03.039
Where's your gear?

49:16.345 --> 49:18.430
Right. On the trucks!

49:19.223 --> 49:21.057
I don't care what regiment you're from.

49:21.726 --> 49:23.768
I don't care how great
you think you are.

49:23.895 --> 49:25.604
Let's see what you're made of, ladies.

49:25.688 --> 49:27.731
- On the trucks.
- Come on!

49:28.941 --> 49:30.108
Get moving, you lot.

49:56.010 --> 49:57.802
He only got half the dose.

49:58.930 --> 50:00.055
Is it enough?

50:00.389 --> 50:03.517
<i>Enough? He's a dead man walking.
Stay on him, okay?</i>

50:23.871 --> 50:26.998
<i>His name was Salim bin Amr.
Do you remember the name?</i>

50:27.542 --> 50:29.584
<i>Did you kill him? Think back.</i>

50:30.294 --> 50:31.920
<i>Did you kill him, Major?</i>

50:32.255 --> 50:33.255
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

50:33.464 --> 50:35.423
<i>I did the bastard. So bloody what?</i>

50:35.508 --> 50:37.008
Danny didn't want to do this.

50:38.135 --> 50:39.135
<i>You did?</i>

50:40.638 --> 50:43.139
And your boy doesn't want
to go back to the desert.

50:56.988 --> 50:58.071
<i>The Ministry of Defence</i>

50:58.155 --> 51:01.408
<i>today announced the death
of an army officer during maneuvers.</i>

51:01.492 --> 51:03.952
<i>Thirty-three-year-old,
Major Warrick Steven Cregg,</i>

51:04.328 --> 51:07.998
<i>died of exposure during an SAS exercise
on the Brecon Beacons.</i>

51:09.000 --> 51:12.252
<i>Weather conditions at the time
were described as appalling, with...</i>

51:24.724 --> 51:25.849
Hey! Hey!

51:29.437 --> 51:31.021
Show a bit of respect, lads.

51:43.284 --> 51:44.451
Top that.

51:44.660 --> 51:46.828
I come bearing gifts.

51:52.209 --> 51:54.544
From my boys in Angola.

51:56.422 --> 51:58.048
I have no idea how you're meant
to eat this.

51:59.133 --> 52:01.051
- So.
- So.

52:02.261 --> 52:03.345
Who's on our ass?

52:03.429 --> 52:04.471
I'm on it. Don't worry.

52:05.306 --> 52:07.265
Look, there's only one more to go.

52:07.350 --> 52:10.143
After this is done, I'll get you boys
a nice, cushy job in the sun.

52:12.730 --> 52:13.813
There is no "after this."

52:18.402 --> 52:19.903
I'm a vulture.

52:20.071 --> 52:21.196
I live off killers.

52:21.739 --> 52:23.907
It gives me a unique perspective.

52:23.991 --> 52:26.326
Have you heard of the two percent?
That's you.

52:26.410 --> 52:28.203
Davies, the SAS, all you lot.

52:28.454 --> 52:30.080
Mercenaries, hit men, heroes.

52:30.539 --> 52:33.458
You're all part of that two percent of men
who are natural killers.

52:34.377 --> 52:36.002
That's why you'll never get out.

52:36.796 --> 52:38.421
You can't run away from who you are, Danny.

52:41.300 --> 52:43.134
That's not who I am,

52:43.219 --> 52:44.594
that's what I've done.

52:45.346 --> 52:47.138
And I can do something else.

52:47.223 --> 52:48.598
Yeah, yeah.

52:48.891 --> 52:49.933
That's all nice and good.

52:50.017 --> 52:52.936
But let's just take care
of business first, shall we?

52:53.813 --> 52:56.106
Your third target, Major Simon McCann,

52:57.358 --> 52:59.067
Mad Simon McCann of late.

52:59.235 --> 53:00.318
How'd you find him?

53:00.444 --> 53:02.237
Asked around. It was easy.

53:03.239 --> 53:05.824
These days, he's your basic
"cash for trash" mercenary.

53:07.618 --> 53:08.952
He's a sitting duck.

53:10.579 --> 53:12.330
Now didn't I tell you
I came bearing gifts?

53:13.999 --> 53:15.458
You know where to find me.

53:18.546 --> 53:20.004
You don't trust that snake, do you?

53:20.297 --> 53:21.297
He's lying.

53:21.382 --> 53:22.632
Yeah? How do you know?

53:23.134 --> 53:24.384
His lips were moving.

53:24.468 --> 53:26.469
He just gave us a third target.

53:26.554 --> 53:27.721
You've done nothing on that last file.

53:28.180 --> 53:29.180
Someone's onto us.

53:29.473 --> 53:30.932
I want Hunter out of there.

53:31.559 --> 53:32.559
I want this finished.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.352
And I want to be around
to enjoy the money when it is.

53:34.645 --> 53:36.396
The first thing you should buy
is a pair of balls.

53:38.232 --> 53:40.316
We're going after McCann, all right?

53:46.907 --> 53:47.991
<i>I miss you.</i>

53:49.243 --> 53:52.912
There's a lot I don't know about you,
but I do know that much.

53:53.664 --> 53:55.331
I convince myself that everything's okay

53:55.416 --> 53:57.917
because when I'm with you I'm happy.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.172
But then you go away and I realize
that I know nothing about you.

54:03.549 --> 54:06.384
<i>I don't know where you go
and I don't know what you do, I mean,</i>

54:07.178 --> 54:08.511
<i>you've got a whole nother life, Danny.</i>

54:11.348 --> 54:12.348
Is there someone else?

54:12.683 --> 54:13.641
Come on, Anne.

54:13.726 --> 54:14.726
<i>Well, then, what is it?</i>

54:16.353 --> 54:19.189
I mean, Jesus, what are you not telling me?
What are you hiding?

54:19.273 --> 54:21.357
<i>Can we talk about this
when I get back?</i>

54:22.026 --> 54:23.026
To hell with it.

54:27.740 --> 54:28.740
Fuck.

54:40.461 --> 54:41.461
What?

54:42.087 --> 54:43.713
You show me a beautiful woman,

54:44.131 --> 54:46.758
I'll show you a bloke
that's sick of her shit.

54:46.842 --> 54:47.842
Shut up.

54:47.968 --> 54:48.968
Roger that.

54:52.473 --> 54:53.765
- That him?
- That's him.

54:54.558 --> 54:56.059
Major Simon McCann.

54:56.519 --> 55:00.188
Served in the Sultan's forces
till he was pensioned out four years ago.

55:01.023 --> 55:02.023
And another.

55:04.485 --> 55:05.610
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

55:05.903 --> 55:07.695
- Piss off, grandpa.
- You want some?

55:11.408 --> 55:13.076
Doesn't look like an invalid.

55:13.994 --> 55:18.289
Like I said, a bomb went off under his jeep,
scrambled his wiring.

55:18.916 --> 55:20.083
He can't keep a job.

55:20.334 --> 55:21.751
He's a fucking psycho.

55:24.672 --> 55:25.672
Jesus.

55:29.134 --> 55:30.802
Come on, mate, that's enough.

55:31.762 --> 55:32.762
What's he doing here?

55:35.224 --> 55:37.183
That's the one I went head-to-head with
at the hospital.

55:42.731 --> 55:43.690
Right.

55:43.774 --> 55:44.858
Wait, wait, wait.

55:51.282 --> 55:52.282
Let's go.

55:54.034 --> 55:55.118
Stick with him.

56:33.782 --> 56:35.658
Mac, it's me. You okay?

56:36.160 --> 56:39.245
<i>Oh, yeah, still scraping skinheads
off my doorstep.</i>

56:39.538 --> 56:40.538
All right, mate.

56:40.706 --> 56:42.498
I was just checking in.

56:50.382 --> 56:52.008
Bloke who drives that green Jag,

56:52.509 --> 56:53.509
what's his name?

56:55.179 --> 56:56.846
His name's Spike Logan.

56:57.097 --> 56:58.765
He's an ex-soldier of some kind.

56:59.767 --> 57:02.685
He got his eye shot out
playing a hero somewhere.

57:03.145 --> 57:06.022
He's got no job
and he keeps odd hours.

57:08.984 --> 57:10.610
Don't you know who these guys are?

57:11.070 --> 57:13.112
I mean, secrets being your bread and butter.

57:13.197 --> 57:14.489
Don't worry about it.

57:14.573 --> 57:17.033
I do worry about it.
You should, too.

57:17.368 --> 57:20.036
Every move my guys make,
these lot are waiting.

57:20.412 --> 57:21.496
You ask me,

57:21.789 --> 57:24.916
I think it's time you put
those fancy shoes of yours on a few throats.

57:25.626 --> 57:28.044
Yes. But no one is asking you.

57:33.759 --> 57:36.344
You'll be interviewing
for a security position, Mr. McCann.

57:36.512 --> 57:37.595
<i>Right.</i>

57:37.680 --> 57:40.139
Actually we got your name
from a mutual friend in the SAS.

57:40.307 --> 57:41.724
<i>Yeah, really?</i>

57:41.976 --> 57:44.310
So, we'll see you Tuesday the 17th, at 10:00.

57:44.395 --> 57:46.270
- <i>Okay.</i>
- We look forward to it.

57:46.355 --> 57:48.106
- <i>See you then.</i>
- All right, my son.

57:49.942 --> 57:51.067
He'll be there.

57:51.318 --> 57:53.403
- Good.
- I don't get it.

57:55.948 --> 57:56.948
McCann lives here.

57:57.741 --> 58:00.493
He'll be here for the interview,
Tuesday at 10:00.

58:01.912 --> 58:02.912
He'll take this road.

58:03.747 --> 58:05.873
The Boston Brakes. Perfect.

58:06.125 --> 58:07.417
They weren't perfect in Boston.

58:07.501 --> 58:08.751
I wasn't at the controls.

58:08.836 --> 58:09.919
We've got 10 days.

58:10.212 --> 58:11.212
Ten days?

58:11.422 --> 58:12.755
The quicker we get this done, the better.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.590
I'm going to need to bring in some help.

58:15.092 --> 58:16.509
- Okay.
- "Okay." Just like that?

58:17.594 --> 58:18.928
McCann's being watched.

58:19.096 --> 58:20.763
How are you gonna get a confession
out of him?

58:20.848 --> 58:21.848
We aren't.

58:22.224 --> 58:23.224
We'll fake it.

58:24.018 --> 58:25.143
Bit of bad lighting and camera work,

58:25.769 --> 58:26.769
you could be him.

58:27.438 --> 58:30.314
What we'll do is play back
what he admitted to in the reports.

58:47.458 --> 58:48.458
Who are you?

58:48.709 --> 58:51.794
I'm the one they let fly around
in an unmarked chopper with a gun in my pocket.

58:52.296 --> 58:54.714
- You can call me MFWIC.
- "MFWIC"?

58:55.007 --> 58:56.966
Mother Fucker What's In Charge.

58:58.218 --> 58:59.635
We have questions.

59:00.387 --> 59:03.848
About this little illegal club of yours,
The Feather Men.

59:04.349 --> 59:05.641
Your attack dog,

59:05.893 --> 59:07.552
time to bring him to heel.

59:11.940 --> 59:13.316
And then we'll put that on the agenda.

59:13.400 --> 59:14.484
Gentlemen.

59:14.943 --> 59:16.569
We'll be with you in a minute.

59:23.285 --> 59:26.537
I want to put Locals on Major McCann
around the clock.

59:26.622 --> 59:30.166
I realize McCann is an old friend of yours,
but what has it to do with us?

59:33.879 --> 59:36.589
But this is our chance to get the bastards
who killed Cregg and Harris.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.967
The authorities found no evidence of foul play
in either case.

59:40.094 --> 59:41.344
What are you talking about, "No evidence?"

59:41.428 --> 59:43.012
I've got the evidence right here.

59:46.975 --> 59:50.520
Everybody in this room knows
that those men were killed.

59:51.605 --> 59:54.023
Everybody knows that McCann
is going to be next.

59:54.316 --> 59:56.442
- That's enough, Spike.
- We have to do something.

59:56.568 --> 59:57.819
Well, we could put it to the vote.

59:57.945 --> 01:00:00.029
Yes, but that would require
the full committee.

01:00:00.114 --> 01:00:02.824
And it will have to wait.

01:00:19.091 --> 01:00:21.050
- Spike.
- That was a set-up.

01:00:21.552 --> 01:00:23.594
He sent him away.
He knew there'd be a vote.

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:26.055
Spike, please. Look, listen.

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:28.057
This is getting big.

01:00:29.268 --> 01:00:31.894
The powers that be are asking questions.
Pressure's being applied.

01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:33.563
They have their reputations to protect.

01:00:33.647 --> 01:00:36.440
I'm not doing this to protect reputations.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:38.609
You know, a light touch is one thing,

01:00:38.694 --> 01:00:40.444
but no touch at all?
I can't do this.

01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:43.823
You realize this thing
is set up for maximum deniability?

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:45.908
You're the only one
who knows the Locals.

01:00:45.993 --> 01:00:47.535
All their orders come through you.

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:48.619
So?

01:00:48.704 --> 01:00:51.080
So? If this comes out,

01:00:51.957 --> 01:00:53.082
you're the one who takes the fall.

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:55.626
Fall? From where?

01:00:56.837 --> 01:00:59.005
I am done with this whole committee thing.

01:01:00.215 --> 01:01:01.757
I'm gonna find him.

01:01:04.636 --> 01:01:05.845
He's a good kid, don't worry.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.346
I'm shtupping his mom.

01:01:07.639 --> 01:01:09.515
Does he know he can't bring
his mom on the job?

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.975
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:31.704
Tell your mates in Oman I said hello.

01:01:32.497 --> 01:01:33.497
Danny,

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.291
is this what it was like
when you were first starting?

01:01:35.918 --> 01:01:36.918
This is your first job?

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:38.377
Jesus.

01:01:40.047 --> 01:01:42.381
My first time,
I puked for a day afterwards.

01:01:43.383 --> 01:01:45.801
I was young and dumb,
just the way the army likes them.

01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:47.553
I could be good at this, man.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:50.139
I mean, it's easy, yeah?

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:51.474
Killing's easy.

01:01:54.186 --> 01:01:55.770
Living with it is the hard part.

01:02:00.234 --> 01:02:01.817
If I see him,
I'll give you a bell.

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:04.904
Don't be shy about spreading the word.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.657
There's a very tidy finder's fee.

01:02:08.242 --> 01:02:09.242
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:11.369
One more and we'll call it a night.

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:17.208
We're on.

01:02:20.045 --> 01:02:21.087
He's late.

01:02:24.591 --> 01:02:26.175
Just keep me at 75 feet

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:28.010
- and give me a clear line of sight.
- Yeah, okay.

01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:17.727
Where'd you buy your license?

01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:22.565
On his tail.

01:03:22.774 --> 01:03:23.899
Doing 60.

01:03:29.948 --> 01:03:32.158
You'll have a visual on Danny in one minute.

01:03:37.122 --> 01:03:39.457
- Stay with him, Jake.
- I got him.

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:43.627
We have target in sight.

01:03:43.795 --> 01:03:44.837
Gonna miss it.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.130
Come on, get in.
Get in behind him!

01:03:47.382 --> 01:03:48.799
- Just do it, get in!
- There's not enough room!

01:03:48.884 --> 01:03:50.468
- Push him!
- I can't get in there.

01:03:50.719 --> 01:03:52.053
Okay, then overtake him. Go!

01:03:52.137 --> 01:03:53.262
Pass him!

01:03:54.973 --> 01:03:56.098
What the hell are you doing, Meier?

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:57.683
<i>I need a range countdown.</i>

01:03:57.768 --> 01:03:59.185
<i>Meier, don't screw this up.</i>

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.353
I'll operate looking backwards.

01:04:00.729 --> 01:04:01.896
<i>Relax, Meier.</i>

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.105
Davies will give you the countdown.

01:04:07.819 --> 01:04:08.819
400 meters.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.825
Okay, range me.

01:04:18.997 --> 01:04:20.122
300 meters.

01:04:22.542 --> 01:04:23.584
<i>Outside lane, Meier.</i>

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.838
200 meters.

01:04:32.511 --> 01:04:33.803
Here he comes.

01:04:35.597 --> 01:04:36.722
100 meters.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:48.067
- Now, now. Now, Meier!
- Shut up!

01:04:48.151 --> 01:04:49.276
Now, Meier!

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.946
Fishtail! Fishtail!

01:05:02.707 --> 01:05:03.707
<i>You fucking got him!</i>

01:05:04.126 --> 01:05:05.251
<i>You got him, man.</i>

01:05:05.419 --> 01:05:08.003
<i>Oh, fuck, he's dead.
He's dead as Elvis.</i>

01:05:16.847 --> 01:05:17.972
You got him, man!

01:05:18.223 --> 01:05:19.306
Stop the car.

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:22.560
We gotta be sure Elvis has left the building.

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:32.695
Target had a minder.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:35.364
<i>Head to the exit point.</i>

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.161
Bring him to me.

01:05:42.622 --> 01:05:44.707
- He had a fucking minder.
- Fuck! You got him, man. You got him!

01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:47.042
Shut up! Drive! Go! Go! Go!

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.378
- Who is he?
- I don't know. Give me an update, Davies.

01:05:51.298 --> 01:05:53.424
Oh, man, he's coming fast!

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:57.094
Up here there's a yard.
Take a left.

01:05:57.179 --> 01:05:58.929
- Shit!
- Up here to the left. Keep going.

01:05:59.014 --> 01:06:00.055
Hold on.

01:06:01.933 --> 01:06:02.933
Come in, Davies.

01:06:08.773 --> 01:06:10.900
Davies, where the fuck are you?

01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:12.151
Got you, you bastards.

01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:15.321
Fuck this!

01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:17.114
Go! Go!

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.910
Here he comes!
Here he comes!

01:06:25.957 --> 01:06:27.541
Get out of the car!

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:30.377
Where the fuck do you guys come from?

01:06:30.587 --> 01:06:31.670
- Step away from the car.
- Easy.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:33.255
- Jake.
- Yeah?

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.757
- Take it easy.
- Check the car.

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:35.925
Slowly.

01:06:37.385 --> 01:06:38.552
No, no, no, no!

01:06:48.813 --> 01:06:49.980
No!

01:07:09.209 --> 01:07:10.376
He had no ID.

01:07:10.835 --> 01:07:11.835
Nothing.

01:07:12.504 --> 01:07:13.796
Not a fucking thing.

01:07:14.673 --> 01:07:15.673
Who the fuck is he?

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.427
This shouldn't have happened.

01:07:20.512 --> 01:07:21.887
This should not have fucking happened!

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:23.347
- Take it easy, Danny.
- Danny...

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:24.473
Take it easy?

01:07:25.976 --> 01:07:27.935
We were out of there.
Clean. Done.

01:07:49.624 --> 01:07:51.375
<i>Look, I'm getting nothing.
Campbell's not picking up.</i>

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:52.710
- <i>Is there anything at your end?</i>
- Fuck.

01:07:53.712 --> 01:07:55.170
Who are these bastards?

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:58.716
I don't know. But they're looking for their man
and they're not legit.

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.427
Jake, call this number.

01:08:03.263 --> 01:08:05.556
Tell the Agent we need
a cleanup crew here ASAP.

01:08:06.099 --> 01:08:07.600
And wire that radio into my car.

01:08:08.602 --> 01:08:09.602
Gimme here.

01:08:14.024 --> 01:08:15.149
- That's it then.
- Yeah.

01:08:16.276 --> 01:08:17.276
Done.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:19.987
I fly tonight.

01:08:20.654 --> 01:08:22.656
You should get going, too.
They're close.

01:08:23.073 --> 01:08:24.366
What happens to Meier's cut?

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.618
There has to be somebody.

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:27.703
Poor sod.

01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:29.981
I'll have a hooker for him.
He'd like that.

01:08:31.582 --> 01:08:32.582
Yeah.

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:34.209
Be safe.

01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:36.211
You too, Davies.

01:08:44.054 --> 01:08:47.139
<i>Sorry. We're still looking for Campbell,
but it looks bad.</i>

01:09:17.962 --> 01:09:19.046
Thank you, sir.

01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:21.173
If there's anything else...

01:09:21.256 --> 01:09:22.256
Room service.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:23.634
Something exotic.

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.617
- Yeah?
- <i>I found your Welshman.</i>

01:09:50.328 --> 01:09:52.371
- You sure it's him?
- <i>I'm sure.</i>

01:10:24.946 --> 01:10:26.321
Fucking hell!

01:10:28.116 --> 01:10:30.325
Get up. Get dressed. Move!

01:10:30.577 --> 01:10:31.910
- Look...
- Get up!

01:10:33.288 --> 01:10:34.830
Don't say a word to anyone.
Do you understand?

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:38.041
You killed Simon McCann, didn't you?

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:40.669
Yeah? And Campbell.

01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:42.254
Where is he, you fucker?

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:43.505
Never heard of him.

01:10:47.635 --> 01:10:49.136
That all you got?

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:53.015
Yeah, Spike?

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:54.808
<i>We got the Welshman.</i>

01:10:54.893 --> 01:10:56.685
<i>We're bringing him to you now. Over.</i>

01:10:57.562 --> 01:10:59.354
<i>Nice work, Pennock.
Well done.</i>

01:11:00.148 --> 01:11:02.357
<i>I'm looking forward
to meeting the bastard.</i>

01:11:07.155 --> 01:11:10.574
Hey, Spike's gonna cut your dick off
and shove it in your mouth. You like that?

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.784
- I like the sound of that, yeah.
- Do you?

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:13.535
- Yeah, I do.
- Get in the van.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.704
- Get in.
- Come on, get in!

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.214
Fuck me. You're kidding.

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:26.757
Come on. Get in!

01:11:33.097 --> 01:11:34.640
There you are, you prick.

01:11:51.324 --> 01:11:52.324
Open up.

01:12:07.257 --> 01:12:08.257
Boss.

01:12:14.973 --> 01:12:16.098
What am I meant to do with that?

01:12:17.225 --> 01:12:18.267
He had this on him.

01:12:18.893 --> 01:12:20.352
A phone number. Great work.

01:12:22.897 --> 01:12:27.234
That pile of mincemeat was our best chance
of finding out who these bastards are.

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:30.529
Print him and trace that bloody number.

01:12:33.074 --> 01:12:34.241
You fucking idiots!

01:12:51.384 --> 01:12:52.384
Drop it.

01:12:53.511 --> 01:12:56.179
Left hand. Put the gun on the floor.

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.607
Kick it to me.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:12.321
The Welshman, they were bringing him to you.
Where is he?

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:14.698
He didn't make it.

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.618
You? You do it?

01:13:17.869 --> 01:13:19.995
A truck. He made a break for it.

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:21.496
He got lucky.

01:13:22.415 --> 01:13:23.540
Would have been very slow otherwise.

01:13:23.625 --> 01:13:25.542
Yeah, well that was my fucking friend.

01:13:25.627 --> 01:13:27.252
Yeah, and McCann was mine.
And what about fucking...

01:13:27.337 --> 01:13:28.587
Campbell?

01:13:28.963 --> 01:13:30.047
No.

01:13:30.882 --> 01:13:33.342
Davies. Meier. Harris.

01:13:34.719 --> 01:13:36.929
McCann. Cregg. Campbell.

01:13:38.348 --> 01:13:39.389
Too many names on that list.

01:13:40.558 --> 01:13:42.684
Don't go adding yours, Spike.

01:13:42.769 --> 01:13:43.769
Inside.

01:13:47.649 --> 01:13:48.774
Who are you?

01:13:49.359 --> 01:13:50.776
Doesn't matter.

01:13:51.486 --> 01:13:52.819
After tonight, I don't exist.

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:54.696
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

01:13:55.031 --> 01:13:56.031
It's over.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:57.741
- Done.
- You think so?

01:14:00.828 --> 01:14:03.080
No uniform, no war, not special.

01:14:04.624 --> 01:14:06.208
You don't know what to do with yourself.

01:14:07.293 --> 01:14:08.543
Nobody knows what to do with you.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:10.253
- Right?
- Wrong.

01:14:10.672 --> 01:14:13.090
You know my name
but you don't know me.

01:14:13.174 --> 01:14:15.258
You have no idea
who you're fucking with.

01:14:15.468 --> 01:14:16.468
Really?

01:14:18.972 --> 01:14:20.430
Don't follow me.

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:22.933
Don't put your name on that list.

01:14:34.612 --> 01:14:36.113
The third confession.

01:14:43.162 --> 01:14:45.288
The killers have been killed,

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.249
now you can go home.

01:14:49.419 --> 01:14:50.961
You can have your man.

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.589
You will get the money
when it's been checked.

01:14:55.383 --> 01:14:56.717
Bring him out.

01:14:58.928 --> 01:14:59.928
Bring him out!

01:15:03.349 --> 01:15:06.143
Let me put...
I just wanna put my watch on.

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:07.644
What's the matter with you?

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:08.895
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.105
What's the plan?

01:15:10.565 --> 01:15:12.024
Get out of here.

01:15:12.316 --> 01:15:13.984
Okay, sounds good.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.824
I was sure you were gonna get
yourself killed, kiddo.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.410
How in the hell did you do it?
How'd you pull it off?

01:15:23.494 --> 01:15:24.619
I don't want to talk about it.

01:15:24.704 --> 01:15:25.704
I get it.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.165
Thank you. Not from me,
but from my kids for having a dad.

01:15:28.249 --> 01:15:30.876
I could never thank you enough
for what you did. Never.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.252
Yeah, you can.

01:15:32.587 --> 01:15:34.796
You can get out of the business.
Be done with this shit.

01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:35.881
No more soldiering.

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:37.049
No more mercenary work.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:38.383
All right. Okay, okay.

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:41.303
I'm asking you, please.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:43.430
Tell me you're done.

01:15:44.474 --> 01:15:46.391
- I'm done. I'm out.
- Good.

01:15:47.477 --> 01:15:49.770
Stay out. Otherwise all this
is for nothing.

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:51.938
So, how are the Yankees doing?

01:16:18.925 --> 01:16:20.675
You could have called.

01:16:21.761 --> 01:16:23.386
You wouldn't have answered.

01:16:24.055 --> 01:16:27.390
No. Sorry about that.

01:16:27.475 --> 01:16:28.475
You're sorry?

01:16:29.435 --> 01:16:30.727
It's me who should be sorry.

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.899
So it's over?

01:16:36.734 --> 01:16:37.901
You going back again?

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:39.820
No.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.575
And you're ready to tell me everything?

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.870
Whatever you want to know.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:53.041
Good.

01:16:55.294 --> 01:16:56.378
Except I don't want to know.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:58.880
Not anymore.

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:03.718
I've...

01:17:04.137 --> 01:17:05.387
I've missed you, Danny.

01:17:07.932 --> 01:17:11.601
I don't really care about the past,
I just care about now.

01:17:31.539 --> 01:17:33.331
- Hey, boss.
- All right, Cal?

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:35.458
That phone number?
That was a business.

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:37.544
It's for some shit travel agent.

01:17:37.879 --> 01:17:41.381
Runs mercenaries in and out
of every shithole in the world.

01:17:41.883 --> 01:17:42.883
Come in.

01:18:04.447 --> 01:18:05.447
Hello?

01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:07.324
<i>Hello, Danny.</i>

01:18:10.536 --> 01:18:12.412
How'd you get this number?

01:18:12.496 --> 01:18:15.624
<i>Please, Danny,
don't insult my professionalism.</i>

01:18:17.627 --> 01:18:18.627
What do you want?

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:20.962
<i>We got a problem with the job.</i>

01:18:24.258 --> 01:18:25.800
- The job's done.
- <i>No.</i>

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:27.469
<i>You killed the wrong guy.</i>

01:18:27.595 --> 01:18:28.637
<i>There's one more to go.</i>

01:18:28.763 --> 01:18:32.265
<i>I busted my nuts setting this job up
and I want my 10%.</i>

01:18:33.226 --> 01:18:34.893
No, I did what I had to do.

01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:36.311
<i>Tell that to the Sheikh.</i>

01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:38.563
<i>He wants a London meet with his son.</i>

01:18:39.065 --> 01:18:41.934
<i>Check with your girlfriend
before you make any rash decisions.</i>

01:19:52.972 --> 01:19:55.515
What are you doing? Come to bed.

01:20:02.023 --> 01:20:03.106
Come with me, Anne.

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.150
- What?
- To Paris.

01:20:06.027 --> 01:20:08.320
You can wait for me there
while I'm in London.

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:10.572
Leave tomorrow.
Nothing's keeping you here, right?

01:20:11.532 --> 01:20:13.908
- It's the middle of the night.
- Anne. Anne!

01:20:14.702 --> 01:20:16.119
They know about you.

01:20:16.203 --> 01:20:17.579
Who knows about me?

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:20.540
And about us.

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:56.493
When will this be over?

01:20:57.036 --> 01:20:58.036
Soon.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.374
If all goes well.

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:04.250
It will, won't it?

01:21:33.239 --> 01:21:34.239
Danny.

01:21:34.824 --> 01:21:35.949
Keep a good eye on her, huh?

01:21:36.367 --> 01:21:37.992
Listen, don't do this on your own.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:39.494
No other way.

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:41.121
Davies, Meier, all this heat on you.

01:21:41.205 --> 01:21:43.790
Come on, let's just get in the car,
we'll go to London, be at the airport...

01:21:43.874 --> 01:21:45.917
No. We have a deal, remember?

01:21:46.502 --> 01:21:48.711
What do you mean?
You think I can't cut this, is that it?

01:21:48.838 --> 01:21:50.380
I mean, I'm not a babysitter,
come on!

01:21:50.464 --> 01:21:51.464
I need to know she's safe.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.133
You're the only one I trust.

01:21:53.217 --> 01:21:55.844
This is bullshit.
You could run, both of you just go, come on.

01:21:55.928 --> 01:21:58.054
Everyone gets found. You know that.

01:21:58.681 --> 01:22:00.807
You're gonna get yourself killed, kiddo.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.106
Thanks for doing this.

01:22:09.191 --> 01:22:10.483
You gotta be kidding me.

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:25.665
- Welcome back to London, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

01:23:05.289 --> 01:23:07.999
You tell the old man he threatens her again,
I'll put it between his eyes.

01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:12.170
Harris, the pilot, on his film
he said another soldier killed my brother.

01:23:13.005 --> 01:23:14.297
He was winding us up.

01:23:14.882 --> 01:23:16.299
He thought it was some kind of a joke!

01:23:16.383 --> 01:23:17.383
This was just published.

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:21.221
The author served with the SAS.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.558
He describes an ambush
where he killed a guerilla leader.

01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:28.770
Harris did not kill Hussain.

01:23:32.858 --> 01:23:34.067
You gave me his name.

01:23:35.194 --> 01:23:36.653
You said he was guilty.

01:23:38.531 --> 01:23:39.948
Such is Allah's will.

01:23:41.158 --> 01:23:42.492
Allah's will?

01:23:42.952 --> 01:23:44.786
You had me kill an innocent man.

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:48.957
The book will be the real killer's confession.

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:51.960
My father...

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:54.504
I know what your father needs.

01:24:07.309 --> 01:24:09.686
I need everything you can get
on a Ranulph Fiennes.

01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:11.521
Yeah, writer, ex-SAS.

01:24:26.787 --> 01:24:27.787
What you got?

01:24:28.455 --> 01:24:29.706
I got Fiennes.

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:32.166
He's still pushing his book on Oman.

01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:35.003
He'll be doing a press bash on Tuesday.

01:24:37.423 --> 01:24:39.382
- Tuesday.
- I know it's a bit short notice,

01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:40.942
but I'll be able to put a crew together.

01:24:42.636 --> 01:24:43.636
I'll do this on my own.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.680
Danny, are you sure?

01:24:46.015 --> 01:24:47.015
It's just a phone call.

01:24:49.101 --> 01:24:50.101
I guess he's sure.

01:24:55.316 --> 01:24:58.359
B-I-N-G fucking O.

01:24:59.653 --> 01:25:02.155
I knew I'd find you, you bastard.

01:25:19.506 --> 01:25:20.506
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:24.344
- You look lonely.
- You're Danny's friend.

01:25:25.971 --> 01:25:27.096
The famous Hunter.

01:25:27.348 --> 01:25:28.348
He say nice things?

01:25:28.932 --> 01:25:29.932
What are you doing here?

01:25:31.352 --> 01:25:32.352
Watching you.

01:25:32.895 --> 01:25:33.895
You should be with him.

01:25:34.063 --> 01:25:36.272
I tried. It didn't work.

01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:37.899
He wanted me here to protect you.

01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:40.068
And you look like you needed protecting.

01:25:40.819 --> 01:25:41.944
From what?

01:25:42.029 --> 01:25:43.071
You.

01:25:45.074 --> 01:25:47.909
You're thinking about him not coming back.
What happens then?

01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:52.580
- No, I...
- I have a wife, I know the look.

01:25:53.707 --> 01:25:57.251
We've known each other through
thick and thin, Danny and I.

01:25:57.586 --> 01:26:00.254
Celine, my wife, she loves him,
my kids love him.

01:26:00.547 --> 01:26:02.590
I mean, wild animals like Danny.

01:26:04.051 --> 01:26:05.051
Yeah.

01:26:06.679 --> 01:26:09.180
I know Danny's going
to come back for you.

01:26:10.099 --> 01:26:12.141
And when he does,
you're going to steal him away.

01:26:13.727 --> 01:26:15.269
I don't know what the plan is.

01:26:23.821 --> 01:26:25.738
I have a woman to interrogate now.

01:26:32.079 --> 01:26:33.579
All right, look alive, lads.

01:26:33.664 --> 01:26:34.872
Boys.

01:26:35.791 --> 01:26:37.375
So this guy is good. Very good.

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:41.254
If he senses something's up, he'll run
until you corner him and then he fights.

01:26:41.338 --> 01:26:42.880
But now the gloves are off.

01:26:42.965 --> 01:26:45.049
This all fucking ends today.

01:26:45.134 --> 01:26:46.426
All right, everybody knows the rules.

01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:47.510
There are no rules.

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.963
<i>Boss, he's out front.
I think we're on.</i>

01:27:32.473 --> 01:27:33.723
This could be him. Black leathers.

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:35.349
Roger that.

01:27:50.115 --> 01:27:52.200
He just took the service stairs.
It has to be him.

01:27:52.284 --> 01:27:54.202
Just hold your positions.
We'll know soon enough.

01:28:23.649 --> 01:28:25.942
- He's down, boss. We got him!
- He stays alive.

01:28:26.026 --> 01:28:28.069
Pennock, don't you touch him
until I'm there.

01:28:28.153 --> 01:28:29.237
Stay here.

01:28:35.744 --> 01:28:37.370
Stay there, you fucker.

01:28:39.206 --> 01:28:40.915
Get his helmet off before he chokes.

01:28:46.922 --> 01:28:47.922
Shit.

01:28:51.093 --> 01:28:53.052
Hands high, against the wall.

01:28:56.265 --> 01:28:57.932
Okay, easy with that.

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:40.141
Guys, our man's down.
Head for the roof.

01:30:07.586 --> 01:30:09.420
Pennock, head for the roof.

01:30:10.297 --> 01:30:11.881
We're on our way up now, boss.

01:30:11.965 --> 01:30:13.215
Come on, move!

01:30:38.575 --> 01:30:39.867
He jumped! He jumped!

01:31:11.984 --> 01:31:13.567
Come on, come on, he's on the move.
Let's go!

01:31:59.448 --> 01:32:00.531
<i>Pennock?</i>

01:32:02.534 --> 01:32:03.617
Don't you do it.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:09.123
<i>There's no sign of him up here, boss.</i>

01:32:09.207 --> 01:32:11.083
<i>I can see all the way to the river.</i>

01:32:11.168 --> 01:32:12.668
<i>He's gone.</i>

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:25.306
Shit.

01:32:26.808 --> 01:32:28.309
Move and you're dead.

01:32:30.812 --> 01:32:32.813
Right, let's go, let's go.

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:38.319
Get in.

01:32:58.673 --> 01:32:59.673
What is this?

01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:04.512
That's for Campbell.

01:33:06.515 --> 01:33:08.808
- And that's for Cregg.
- You finished?

01:33:10.519 --> 01:33:12.103
We haven't even started.

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:13.437
Take the hood off.

01:33:15.607 --> 01:33:16.941
Wait outside, boys.

01:33:21.571 --> 01:33:23.906
Save a little bit for us, boss.

01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:30.329
So why is he still alive?
Why didn't you kill him?

01:33:31.289 --> 01:33:32.748
Is that what you would have done?

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:34.792
I thought you were the good guys.

01:33:35.544 --> 01:33:36.544
Who are you?

01:33:37.379 --> 01:33:38.546
Who do you work for?

01:33:39.589 --> 01:33:40.881
You and I got a lot in common.

01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:43.300
Really? You think so?

01:33:44.302 --> 01:33:46.971
So, you're sitting there,
tied to a chair

01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:49.265
and I'm standing here
with a gun in my hand.

01:33:49.474 --> 01:33:52.726
Now you tell me
what the fuck this was all about.

01:33:54.354 --> 01:33:55.354
"Was?"

01:33:57.232 --> 01:33:58.232
You think this is over?

01:33:59.067 --> 01:34:00.526
There'll be somebody else.

01:34:01.027 --> 01:34:02.027
Your boy, Fiennes, is gonna die.

01:34:12.455 --> 01:34:14.206
Go on, pull the trigger.

01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:15.416
Kill me and you kill Fiennes.

01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:17.293
They won't stop till they get him.

01:34:17.377 --> 01:34:19.295
I stopped you, I'll stop them.

01:34:19.379 --> 01:34:20.421
I didn't want to kill him.

01:34:21.298 --> 01:34:22.298
They will.

01:34:24.259 --> 01:34:26.677
You put that in the right hands,
this thing's over.

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:27.761
The camera? Why?

01:34:27.846 --> 01:34:28.971
Proof.

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:31.515
Evidence that he's dead.

01:34:33.268 --> 01:34:35.644
It's the only way you'll save him.

01:34:36.104 --> 01:34:38.856
You tell me I'll walk, I'll tell you
who's behind this and where to find him.

01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:42.943
Okay.

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:45.613
You walk.

01:34:47.449 --> 01:34:49.325
Sheikh Amr bin Issa.

01:34:50.035 --> 01:34:51.660
You'll find him in Oman.

01:34:51.745 --> 01:34:53.621
- Why?
- The war.

01:34:55.665 --> 01:34:57.791
They killed three of his sons.

01:35:04.424 --> 01:35:05.424
No.

01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:15.317
Some good guy.

01:35:23.568 --> 01:35:24.568
Drop it.

01:35:31.868 --> 01:35:32.868
Inside.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.001
Beside him.

01:35:41.670 --> 01:35:42.670
On your knees.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:54.765
You were set up.

01:35:55.517 --> 01:35:57.184
That's what we love about you lot.

01:35:58.144 --> 01:35:59.645
You only care about the action.

01:36:00.730 --> 01:36:03.565
Never think about what you might
really be fighting for.

01:36:05.026 --> 01:36:06.026
Or who.

01:36:07.737 --> 01:36:09.947
Never see the big picture.

01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:16.787
You're the one that was set up.

01:36:17.038 --> 01:36:19.373
He just wouldn't get out of the way.

01:36:20.834 --> 01:36:24.169
Her Majesty's government
doesn't like secret societies.

01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:28.007
Particularly when they get
in the way of our interests.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:33.178
Do you know how much oil that pathetic
crust of desert is floating on?

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:34.513
Do you know what those contracts are worth?

01:36:34.597 --> 01:36:35.931
Three men's lives.

01:36:36.015 --> 01:36:37.016
That's right.

01:36:39.227 --> 01:36:40.228
That's right.

01:36:41.021 --> 01:36:42.271
We deliver the killers.

01:36:42.355 --> 01:36:43.564
Son Number 4 goes home

01:36:43.648 --> 01:36:45.899
and when Sheikhy re-ups the contracts,

01:36:45.984 --> 01:36:47.443
we get favorable consideration.

01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:50.487
- A bargain.
- You bastard, you're a...

01:36:50.572 --> 01:36:51.572
Patriot.

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:55.701
Who serves his country
as those three men did with their deaths.

01:36:55.785 --> 01:36:56.785
As you will with yours.

01:38:12.195 --> 01:38:13.278
Fuck.

01:38:26.835 --> 01:38:28.502
There she is.

01:38:28.795 --> 01:38:30.796
Danny might've dropped off the radar,

01:38:30.922 --> 01:38:32.506
but one thing's for sure.

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:34.591
He'll come back for her.

01:38:34.968 --> 01:38:39.888
He'll come through that door with $6 million
and she won't be there.

01:38:40.181 --> 01:38:42.641
Who don't you screw out of his 10%?

01:38:42.725 --> 01:38:44.184
Yours truly.

01:38:45.687 --> 01:38:46.854
Boss.

01:38:50.859 --> 01:38:51.900
Deal with him.

01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:10.312
It wasn't personal.

01:40:11.981 --> 01:40:13.023
Just business.

01:40:14.734 --> 01:40:16.109
You played us.

01:40:17.153 --> 01:40:18.445
I don't care why.

01:40:19.072 --> 01:40:21.615
But if ever a lying piece of shit
needed killing, it was you.

01:40:26.287 --> 01:40:27.412
Game's over.

01:40:27.914 --> 01:40:29.873
You know, I wouldn't have hurt her.

01:40:29.958 --> 01:40:31.542
I just wanted my cut.

01:40:31.626 --> 01:40:32.626
She was only collateral.

01:40:41.094 --> 01:40:42.177
If you go after them,

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.138
I'll find you.

01:40:46.182 --> 01:40:48.183
Remember, everybody gets found.

01:40:48.393 --> 01:40:49.726
Even you.

01:41:05.034 --> 01:41:06.827
You gotta get those photos
to that old bastard

01:41:06.953 --> 01:41:08.662
to finish this thing for good,
you hear, kiddo?

01:41:08.746 --> 01:41:09.788
That's why I'm here.

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:11.456
What about you?

01:41:11.833 --> 01:41:13.834
Babysitting's over, kiddo.

01:41:14.836 --> 01:41:16.086
- Who says?
- I say.

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.838
She's safe.
You're the one taking the chances now.

01:41:17.964 --> 01:41:19.464
- Come on.
- "Come on?"

01:41:19.841 --> 01:41:21.258
You walked into a trap last time.

01:41:21.342 --> 01:41:23.010
You think I'm going to let you
do that again?

01:41:23.094 --> 01:41:24.761
I told your girl you were going
to be coming back to her.

01:41:24.846 --> 01:41:26.013
You want to make a liar out of me?

01:41:26.097 --> 01:41:27.431
You know, you were supposed
to be guarding her,

01:41:27.515 --> 01:41:28.640
not interviewing her.

01:41:28.725 --> 01:41:31.893
Well, I was always a sucker for a pretty face,
no denying that.

01:41:31.978 --> 01:41:34.062
She's a keeper, that's for sure.

01:41:35.315 --> 01:41:37.024
She doesn't know, does she?

01:41:37.525 --> 01:41:39.067
- Some.
- Yeah.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.902
It's going to be tough.
My old man used to say,

01:41:40.987 --> 01:41:42.779
"Life's like licking honey from a thorn."

01:41:42.864 --> 01:41:43.864
Yeah, what does that mean?

01:41:44.365 --> 01:41:46.366
Something about good times and bad times.

01:41:46.826 --> 01:41:49.661
Seems like it's been all thorns for us lately.
Both of us.

01:41:50.038 --> 01:41:51.788
All right, let's finish this.

01:41:51.873 --> 01:41:53.248
I'll be top cover.

01:41:53.625 --> 01:41:54.875
Anything goes wrong,

01:41:55.001 --> 01:41:57.294
- I'm coming in.
- Hey, look, the Sheikh wants this over.

01:41:57.378 --> 01:41:58.462
It's in, hand over the photos, and out.

01:41:58.546 --> 01:41:59.546
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:41:59.631 --> 01:42:00.714
There isn't going to be a problem.

01:42:02.008 --> 01:42:04.092
From your mouth to God's ears.

01:42:04.177 --> 01:42:05.927
Don't move till I give the all-clear, okay?

01:42:26.991 --> 01:42:27.991
Who are you?

01:42:29.077 --> 01:42:30.077
What do you want?

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.247
For the Sheikh.

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.293
I have to see it placed in his hands.

01:42:50.807 --> 01:42:52.641
Take these to my people.

01:42:53.309 --> 01:42:54.768
Show them what I have done.

01:42:57.897 --> 01:42:59.648
I have a message for the Sheikh.

01:43:06.531 --> 01:43:07.698
He's still alive.

01:43:11.786 --> 01:43:12.786
They're fakes.

01:43:16.791 --> 01:43:18.166
But this is going to end.

01:43:33.015 --> 01:43:34.141
I don't care.

01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:38.270
What'll I do

01:43:40.231 --> 01:43:42.983
in that godforsaken desert?

01:43:48.531 --> 01:43:49.656
Haven't you forgotten something?

01:44:07.842 --> 01:44:09.593
Hold it, hold it,
stay where you are.

01:44:09.677 --> 01:44:11.303
Something's not right here.

01:44:18.978 --> 01:44:20.312
You seeing this?

01:44:20.396 --> 01:44:21.646
Yeah, I see it.

01:44:27.862 --> 01:44:29.613
So we're in the wrong place.

01:44:49.133 --> 01:44:50.383
Let's go! Let's go!

01:45:31.008 --> 01:45:32.634
Relax, I only killed the car.

01:46:16.262 --> 01:46:17.262
You again!

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.814
Back at the palace,

01:46:28.774 --> 01:46:30.108
what happened in there?

01:46:31.402 --> 01:46:33.904
He was there,
waiting for a message from you.

01:46:33.988 --> 01:46:35.238
I was the messenger.

01:46:35.865 --> 01:46:36.948
And?

01:46:37.033 --> 01:46:38.283
What do you think?

01:46:39.035 --> 01:46:40.952
His boy in there didn't give a shit.

01:46:41.037 --> 01:46:43.705
He's not going back to the desert,
so there'll be no oil contracts.

01:46:45.207 --> 01:46:46.416
It was all for nothing.

01:46:46.876 --> 01:46:47.876
Is that right?

01:47:01.307 --> 01:47:02.849
And the winner is.

01:47:04.226 --> 01:47:05.685
So that's what this is all about.

01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:08.104
Yeah, it's all hookers and blow
from here on in.

01:47:08.898 --> 01:47:09.898
You just don't get it, do you?

01:47:13.361 --> 01:47:14.361
Ditch it.

01:47:14.445 --> 01:47:15.612
You sure?

01:47:16.113 --> 01:47:17.322
Ditch it.

01:47:19.533 --> 01:47:20.992
I gotta cover my expenses.

01:47:23.412 --> 01:47:24.829
You can't go back to England.

01:47:24.914 --> 01:47:26.206
Not after killing that spook.

01:47:26.290 --> 01:47:27.457
Who the fuck are you?

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.542
Who, me? The voice of experience.

01:47:30.127 --> 01:47:31.795
Where are you going to go?
What are you going to do?

01:47:31.879 --> 01:47:32.879
You're going to need this.

01:47:33.631 --> 01:47:35.382
New name, new face, new papers.

01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.385
Expensive. You'll see.

01:47:47.979 --> 01:47:49.229
Damn shame.

01:47:53.442 --> 01:47:54.734
You think you get to just walk away?

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.654
Nobody walks away.

01:47:58.739 --> 01:48:00.782
Not me or you, none of us.

01:48:01.659 --> 01:48:03.785
The old man you just killed,

01:48:04.745 --> 01:48:07.580
he told me a war isn't over
until both sides say it is.

01:48:08.082 --> 01:48:10.333
Well, I'm telling you now,
this is over for me.

01:48:10.668 --> 01:48:13.795
Really? And what? You want me to say,
"Me, too," and then it's happy ever after?

01:48:14.255 --> 01:48:15.255
Your choice.

01:48:15.923 --> 01:48:17.924
You know, when I got this,
they told me my war was over.

01:48:18.009 --> 01:48:19.551
I told them they were full of shit.

01:48:19.635 --> 01:48:20.635
Now I'm telling it to you.

01:48:21.762 --> 01:48:23.138
Let it go.

01:48:30.062 --> 01:48:31.479
So where are you going?

01:48:31.564 --> 01:48:33.106
What, are you planning a visit?

01:48:33.482 --> 01:48:34.607
You never know.

01:48:37.695 --> 01:48:38.695
You come.

01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:40.697
I'll be waiting.

01:48:47.246 --> 01:48:49.039
We'll call you a cab from the airport.

01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:10.310
Hey.

01:49:11.979 --> 01:49:12.979
Aren't you Anne Frazer?

01:49:13.773 --> 01:49:15.023
The girl with those weird gumboots?

01:49:17.902 --> 01:49:20.195
Are you Danny Bryce,
the boy who went away?

01:49:20.279 --> 01:49:21.738
Yeah.

01:49:21.822 --> 01:49:23.114
I'm back.

01:49:23.199 --> 01:49:24.282
Where you headed?

01:49:26.118 --> 01:49:27.494
I don't know.

01:49:27.578 --> 01:49:28.578
Me, neither.

01:49:29.205 --> 01:49:30.330
Want to come along?
