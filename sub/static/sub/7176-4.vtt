WEBVTT

01:00.060 --> 01:02.395
Ivar, what is it?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.530
Where is Harbard?

01:12.740 --> 01:13.823
I don't know.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.450
You have to find him.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.119
Ivar is suffering so badly.
I can't bear it!

01:18.662 --> 01:20.580
Why can't you look after
your own child?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.167
I am here.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.677
Ivar.

01:34.762 --> 01:38.055
There is no more pain, Ivar.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.225
No. No more pain.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.935
That's right.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.687
Very sleepy, Ivar.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.819
You're getting very sleepy.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.781
There's no more pain.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.576
Go to sleep.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.928
Who are you?

02:17.429 --> 02:18.471
You know who I am.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.931
No, I don't.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.142
You have such power.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.979
Are you a god?

02:27.397 --> 02:28.731
I wish.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.943
For who would not wish
for such a thing?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.632
Porunn.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.807
Porunn.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.632
So much for Rollo,
the warrior.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.510
The hammer to the cross.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.928
Where is your soul?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.056
Where is your belief?

05:08.684 --> 05:10.059
Floki, forget it.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.727
This...

05:12.437 --> 05:13.896
This is the future.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.525
We cannot fight everyone.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.568
There must be cooperation,

05:19.986 --> 05:22.905
alliances just as
there are among the gods.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.866
That is the way forward.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.452
Well, well.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.163
It seems that
the magic of your
Christian baptism

05:31.248 --> 05:32.248
has worked after all.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.834
You said the whole
thing was a joke.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.377
Perhaps
you took it seriously.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.296
You know very well
it was a joke.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.840
No.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.801
I can see that
you have all drunk
from the poisoned chalice!

05:43.927 --> 05:46.679
And the joke,
Rollo, is on you!

06:01.445 --> 06:03.654
I see you are
still suffering.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.825
I can make it better.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.869
How?

06:12.456 --> 06:13.622
Lie back.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.175
What are you doing?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.328
I suppose
I should thank you.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.665
I suppose that
maybe you should.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.043
I may have just
saved your life.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.090
Your brother is weak.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.928
He is just a puppet.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.349
And he will be
your downfall.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.314
I know what you think
about Ecbert.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.107
Do you believe him?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.026
Should I not?

07:24.653 --> 07:27.279
He has always acted
in his own interests.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.907
He wants power
over me and over Mercia.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.951
I did not fight for him.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.204
I fought for my people,

07:37.582 --> 07:38.916
and for you.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.215
How is your wound?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.219
It still hurts.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.226
Do you need to lie back?

08:09.865 --> 08:11.073
Wait!

08:13.618 --> 08:14.743
Where are you going?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.828
Out.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.246
Where? With whom?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.581
It is not your concern.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.665
Oh, it is my concern,

08:19.749 --> 08:22.126
since you are once again
leaving your children behind.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.461
I know they will
be safe with you.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.130
Are you going with him?

08:26.756 --> 08:29.133
Just look after my children,
it's all I ask.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.676
No.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.511
What are you trying to do?

08:32.596 --> 08:34.263
I am trying to save you.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.850
It is not just the children.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.060
You have other
responsibilities.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.937
Ragnar has left Kattegat
in your care.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.564
There are folk
who are waiting to see you.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.941
There are important
matters to decide.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.569
Let go of your queen.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.321
Then I will do it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.908
I will accept
the responsibility.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.211
There was
another place
I went to once.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.589
A place called Oslo Fjord.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.259
I heard a story about
a king who was killed

09:12.344 --> 09:15.054
and all his family massacred.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.014
But his wife, Astrid,

09:17.098 --> 09:20.559
she escaped and fled
to an island in
the middle of a lake.

09:20.644 --> 09:22.436
She gave birth to a son.

09:23.647 --> 09:29.360
She survived with
the help of her foster father,
Forolf Lousebeard.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.406
"Forolf Lousebeard"?
That was his name.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.866
I'm not making it up.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.996
Anyway...

09:41.915 --> 09:44.208
I was smuggled
onto the island,

09:45.752 --> 09:48.045
and I was
introduced to Astrid.

09:48.964 --> 09:52.216
She was the most
beautiful woman
I had ever seen.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.927
And she was a nymphomaniac.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.930
She needed a lot of sex.

09:58.014 --> 10:01.433
She had reservations
about sleeping
with her foster father.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.269
She did not want to be
covered with lice.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.354
Exactly.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.905
I was forced
to sleep with her.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.615
Forced?

10:17.450 --> 10:21.245
I heard later
that nine months
after I left the island,

10:21.329 --> 10:24.581
she gave birth to
a second son called Olaf.

10:25.458 --> 10:30.295
Now this Olaf is
Grand Duke of Kiev
and all Russia.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.506
And he is your son?

10:33.341 --> 10:34.925
I am sure of it.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.888
I am forever in your debt.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.182
What you have done
for my son is...

10:42.267 --> 10:45.477
Is what I would do
for any suffering creature.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.439
Like you.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.525
Me?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.068
I am not suffering.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.987
Yes.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.991
Your husband is
a long way away,

10:59.075 --> 11:02.161
and you fear
he no longer
loves or desires you.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.750
How do you know?

11:36.154 --> 11:37.946
Remove your clothes.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.203
It is cold.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.039
Then go back
to your children.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.085
I do not want to be
with my children.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.836
What will King Ecbert
do to me?

13:57.921 --> 14:00.339
He will do nothing to you,

14:00.423 --> 14:03.550
so long as I protect you
and Ragnar protects me.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.721
Ecbert must hide
his power behind

14:07.805 --> 14:10.015
a legitimate heir to
the throne of Mercia.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.017
Then he will not
have me killed.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.894
No,

14:14.562 --> 14:16.188
he will not
have you killed.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.108
Burgred, you and I
will be joint rulers
to the throne of Mercia.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.818
Does that not
excite you, hmm?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.238
The Mercians may
quarrel against us.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.114
No, they will not.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.744
Behind us are
the iron fists of both
Wessex and the Northmen.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.913
Do you see?

14:32.997 --> 14:35.582
Then we will be prisoners
of Ecbert and Ragnar.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.294
I suppose.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.464
But better prisoners
than dead, hmm?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.968
Prisoners can always escape.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.034
It is not his fault.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.998
No, you are right.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.209
It's someone else's fault.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.669
Who's that?

15:21.129 --> 15:23.588
Is it not clear to you,
Bjorn Ironside?

15:25.675 --> 15:28.510
Who brought the Christ god
into our lives?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.263
Floki says we have
betrayed our gods

15:31.347 --> 15:34.599
to serve a Christian king
and a Christian god.

15:35.977 --> 15:40.647
Unlike Floki, I do not think
I can speak for the gods.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.777
All I know is that
my desires and ambitions

15:45.862 --> 15:48.572
for our people
have never changed.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.158
And now that I am King,

15:52.201 --> 15:54.036
I must try
to bring them about.

15:56.289 --> 16:00.417
What limits did Odin
put upon his curiosity?

16:00.501 --> 16:01.668
Who can say?

16:01.753 --> 16:02.794
Exactly.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.547
So unless I seek
out those limits,

16:05.631 --> 16:08.341
I cannot say that
I have honored his spirit.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.844
Floki threatens me with Odin,

16:10.928 --> 16:14.848
but I would not be ashamed
to meet the god face-to-face.

16:18.186 --> 16:22.314
When Ragnar returns,
I am sure he will
stay but a short time

16:22.398 --> 16:24.399
before sailing back home.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.570
He is, after all, a king.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.907
But you could stay.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.077
To what purpose,
King Ecbert?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.787
Well, surely,

16:36.871 --> 16:41.917
someone must stay
to make sure that the new
settlement is successful,

16:42.919 --> 16:45.378
the first harvest
safely gathered.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.839
Someone will stay
to do that.

16:47.924 --> 16:52.094
But even if I am not a king,
I am an earl.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.680
I must return
to look after my people.

16:55.765 --> 16:59.684
It is fine and it is good
to talk of responsibilities,

16:59.769 --> 17:03.271
but there are
other things in life.

17:04.607 --> 17:08.693
What if I asked you
personally to stay?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.946
Do you understand
my meaning?

17:14.450 --> 17:15.784
I understand.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.372
And I've enjoyed
your company.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.457
And the sex.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.592
Even so,

17:32.969 --> 17:36.930
although you have made me
happy and fulfilled,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.350
I have come to understand that

17:40.434 --> 17:43.270
the only person
you truly care for

17:44.522 --> 17:45.522
is yourself.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.142
There.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.020
It's done.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.023
I am glad.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.204
I love you.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.219
Do you love me?

19:02.099 --> 19:03.433
Yes, I love you.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.155
Father.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.324
My son.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.079
No father could be prouder.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.751
Welcome, and
congratulations, Aethelwulf.

19:30.211 --> 19:33.713
You truly deserve our thanks,
and our praise.

19:34.423 --> 19:39.219
Your wife has missed you
beyond endurance.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.596
I have often come across
her in the chapel,

19:41.973 --> 19:47.018
weeping and privately
praying to God for your
safe and sure return.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.688
Judith.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.531
Princess.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.615
Ah. Come.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.201
Sire.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.415
Sire, this is my
young brother, Burgred.

20:08.499 --> 20:11.835
He says that the campaign
against us was
no fault of his.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.254
Well, I am glad to hear it.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.674
Welcome, Burgred, to Wessex.

20:19.802 --> 20:25.515
Sire, my sister has told me
you are a most generous
and forgiving monarch.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.768
I throw myself completely
at your mercy.

20:28.853 --> 20:29.853
No, no, no.

20:30.646 --> 20:34.107
I meant what I said.
You are most welcome.

20:35.318 --> 20:40.530
Please join us
to feast and celebrate
the happy future of Mercia.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.533
You see, I told you.
Come, come.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.836
Ragnar Lothbrok.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.134
Forgive me if
I do not kiss your hand.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.261
I would not
expect it from you.

21:03.346 --> 21:08.141
As I've told you before,
we are equals, you and I.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.269
How is the settlement?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.981
Well, if you want to know
the answer to that question,

21:15.066 --> 21:17.859
you had better
ask Earl Ingstad.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.948
You're wounded.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.201
Ah, yes. But...

21:27.453 --> 21:31.539
But Princess Kwenthrith
gave me some of her medicine.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.837
How is the settlement?

21:39.715 --> 21:43.385
It's working. We have
planted the first crop.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.221
King Ecbert gave us
a new plow, and

21:46.305 --> 21:48.390
always assured us
of his protection.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.769
And you believed him?

21:54.271 --> 21:55.271
Yes.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.609
So it seems you two
got on well, then.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.195
Yes.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.281
For the sake of all of us.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.201
Ah.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.956
So you sacrificed yourself
for the common good.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.040
Hmm.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.294
As did you, Ragnar.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.383
I'm hungry.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.640
Hello, brother.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.102
I don't like you.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.190
Oh!

22:39.650 --> 22:42.193
Oh, my son! Alive and well.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.573
Where's Porunn?

22:47.450 --> 22:48.658
Is she not with you?

22:49.952 --> 22:51.661
They are taking care of her.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.123
Is she hurt?
Yes.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.252
She should never
have been in battle.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.046
She wanted to be like you.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.888
You should be happy.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.975
Your husband
and the father of your child
has returned home alive.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.645
And yet I never saw a woman
look so miserable.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.398
I am very happy
Aethelwulf has returned.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.566
Why would I not be?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.234
Then, Daughter, show it.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.989
The success of our alliance
with Wessex rests upon you.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.367
Not on your shoulders,
but on your womb.

23:32.453 --> 23:35.580
Thankfully,
you have already
delivered a son.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.707
Hopefully more will follow.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.085
Then our dynasty
will be secured.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.714
Respect me, your father.
Respect your husband.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.258
And do what is
required of you.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.387
If I never made that clear
to you before,

23:51.472 --> 23:53.723
I make it clear to you now.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.990
Porunn.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.164
Hello, Bjorn.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.336
Are you enjoying yourself?

24:24.213 --> 24:26.130
There must be a feast.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.971
Why don't you talk to me?

24:38.227 --> 24:39.602
Poor Bjorn.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.398
You won't want
to marry me now, will you?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.234
Don't say that.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.681
Forgive me, Earl Kalf.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.226
There is something
we must earnestly consider.

25:26.567 --> 25:31.237
And what must I
so earnestly consider?

25:32.990 --> 25:35.491
At some point,
if she still lives,

25:35.576 --> 25:37.660
Lagertha will return
from the raid.

25:37.745 --> 25:40.538
And she will bring with her
most of our young warriors,

25:40.623 --> 25:41.873
hardened by battle,

25:41.957 --> 25:44.542
perhaps enriched by spoils.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.795
And, I assume, loyal to her.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.967
Do you really suppose that
I have not considered that?

25:53.427 --> 25:55.345
Do you really think,
poor Einar,

25:55.429 --> 25:57.013
that I have not
prepared for that?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.808
I have invited someone here
to join us.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.729
A very significant
person indeed.

26:05.939 --> 26:09.233
And he will arrive here
very soon.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.656
Very soon.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.874
What are you two
whispering about?

26:26.919 --> 26:28.211
Where is our mother?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.675
Your mother goes to Harbard

26:33.967 --> 26:35.677
because of your brother Ivar.

26:36.053 --> 26:38.680
Ivar needs your mother
more than you do,

26:39.306 --> 26:41.516
and Harbard helps her
to look after him.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.102
Someday, Ubbe,
you will understand

26:44.186 --> 26:47.230
what a mother has to sacrifice
for her children.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.743
Let's go.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.164
Where are you going?

27:08.711 --> 27:10.044
They'll be all right.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.382
Where are Ubbe and Hvitserk?

27:15.718 --> 27:16.718
They went out.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.514
I don't know
why I feel frightened.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.767
I have to find them.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.777
Hey, Ivar.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.364
Ubbe!

28:20.449 --> 28:21.866
Hvitserk!

28:23.952 --> 28:24.952
Stop!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Stop!

28:33.337 --> 28:34.420
Ubbe, stop.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.148
Ubbe.

28:55.442 --> 28:56.484
Hvitserk, stop!

31:50.283 --> 31:51.784
Floki?

31:55.205 --> 31:57.373
What are you doing out here?

31:59.167 --> 32:01.293
I came to talk to the gods.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.297
They are angry, Rollo.

32:09.678 --> 32:13.305
And I'm so afraid
that we must one day
choose between them

32:14.433 --> 32:15.850
and your brother.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.146
For me,
it will never come to that.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.290
Athelstan.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.376
My friend.

32:46.048 --> 32:49.175
The battle for Mercia is won.

32:49.551 --> 32:54.805
But not yet the settlement.
Stay. Stay, both of you.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.974
Oversee your future.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.976
What could be more important?

32:59.061 --> 33:01.228
I have told you
my decision.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.067
Perhaps Athelstan
will stay.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.360
Will you?

33:10.197 --> 33:11.489
I'm not sure.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.991
I've not discussed it
with Ragnar.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.577
Mmm. Or with Judith.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.874
My daughter-in-law
has grown fond of you.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.710
I know it. She has told me.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.714
She sometimes uses you
as a confessor.

33:30.175 --> 33:33.135
If you go,
she will miss you.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.263
As indeed will I.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.699
They are trying
to make you stay?

33:58.453 --> 33:59.453
Yes.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.792
There is something
between you and that girl?

34:08.338 --> 34:09.338
Yes.

34:11.133 --> 34:12.967
You don't understand.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.303
Nobody understands.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.980
We're all free to do
as we please.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.567
Are we still talking
about women?

34:29.651 --> 34:30.943
Mmm.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.800
Why do you stare at me?

34:56.970 --> 34:58.971
Because you interest me.

35:00.557 --> 35:01.724
And...

35:03.685 --> 35:05.436
And you attract me.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.208
They say you will
go home with Ragnar.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.965
Your husband is back.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.884
I gave myself to you.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.346
Please don't leave me.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.995
Hello, Rollo.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.331
Lagertha.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.583
You conquered Mercia.

36:10.752 --> 36:11.710
So it seems.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.629
No, more than seems.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.465
I heard of your exploits.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.843
I also heard about Porunn.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.304
Mmm.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.931
Poor Bjorn.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.557
Yes.

36:26.685 --> 36:27.977
Poor Bjorn.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.313
You don't care?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.859
Of course I care.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.947
Anything to do with you,
I care about.

36:46.579 --> 36:52.668
I have a feeling that
all the way through his life
you have looked after Bjorn.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.213
You have looked after him

36:56.673 --> 36:59.633
almost as if he was
your own son.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.304
Speak on.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.601
I have nothing more to say.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.731
And probably that is better.

37:30.832 --> 37:37.838
So, once again, Athelstan,
you have to make a choice.

37:39.340 --> 37:44.219
Will you go back
with Ragnar Lothbrok
or will you stay with us?

37:44.304 --> 37:45.804
I have made up my mind.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.808
I will go back with Ragnar.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.271
All my future lies
with Ragnar.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.986
I think that is
the wrong decision.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.866
And I doubt its wisdom.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.287
For in your heart,
your true heart,
you are one of us,

38:10.371 --> 38:12.581
and you always will be.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.045
So, you left your earldom.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.675
Are you not afraid?

38:25.678 --> 38:29.223
No, I have a good man
who looks after it for me.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.559
Why should I be afraid?

38:36.231 --> 38:37.981
All men are ambitious.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.401
Not Kalf.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.628
Earl Kalf.

39:02.257 --> 39:03.549
Mmm.
Earl Kalf.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.094
What is it?

39:07.595 --> 39:09.596
Your guests have arrived.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.462
Erlendur, son of Horik.

39:43.756 --> 39:46.508
How gladly we welcome you
to our hall.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.596
How impatiently I have
awaited your coming.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.390
I'm most grateful for
your invitation, Earl Kalf.

39:53.474 --> 39:57.728
I believe with all my heart
that you and I
are natural allies.

39:57.812 --> 40:01.064
Yes! Against the Lothbroks
and all their kith and kin.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.650
And we have
another natural ally.

40:04.694 --> 40:08.780
You may recall that
Ragnar blood eagled
his enemy, Jarl Borg.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.408
But he forgot to kill
Jarl Borg's wife,

40:11.743 --> 40:14.161
who subsequently gave birth
to a son,

40:14.245 --> 40:15.996
and who is now my wife.

40:17.207 --> 40:18.665
Come, Torvi.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.382
Good day to you, Earl Kalf.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.218
Good day to you, Torvi.

40:29.886 --> 40:31.511
And to your son,

40:32.513 --> 40:35.641
the legitimate heir
of the great Jarl Borg.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.532
What will you
do with Mercia?

40:53.117 --> 40:57.704
I will crown Kwenthrith
and her brother Burgred
as joint rulers.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.539
That makes sense.

40:59.874 --> 41:03.043
You see how they feel
for one another.
Why choose between them?

41:04.087 --> 41:06.046
They will not rule
in any case.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.176
Then who will,
Ragnar Lothbrok?

41:11.261 --> 41:12.261
You will.

41:13.429 --> 41:15.722
For you have
given them the crown.

41:17.183 --> 41:22.396
Well, the important thing
for me is that there will be
stability in the region.

41:24.857 --> 41:29.236
The important thing for you
is that Wessex will have
power in Mercia.

41:32.365 --> 41:36.076
Actually, the really important
thing for me

41:36.577 --> 41:39.162
is that your settlement
is a success.

41:39.247 --> 41:41.206
You've helped me
in my conquest for Mercia,

41:41.291 --> 41:44.001
and I've helped you
to establish a settlement

41:44.085 --> 41:46.628
in the very heart
of my kingdom.

41:46.713 --> 41:50.757
If you remember,
it was one of the first things
we ever talked about.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.051
I remember it very well.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.138
You and I,

41:57.932 --> 41:59.766
we understand each other.

42:01.102 --> 42:05.856
That is why we are allies,
and will remain so.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.993
Do you think
you're a good man?

42:21.414 --> 42:22.414
Yes.

42:23.583 --> 42:24.833
I think so.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.130
Are you a good man?

42:33.509 --> 42:34.509
Yes.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.472
I think so.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.187
Are you corrupt?

42:48.566 --> 42:49.858
Oh, yes.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.904
Are you?
Mmm-hmm.

43:00.328 --> 43:03.246
My dear brother,
my dear Burgred,

43:04.374 --> 43:07.751
before all these people,
before King Ecbert of Wessex,

43:08.294 --> 43:11.505
King Ragnar
and King Aelle of Northumbria,

43:12.715 --> 43:16.218
let me say that
I have made peace
with my past.

43:17.303 --> 43:19.137
I have come to terms
with my family,

43:19.555 --> 43:21.681
with all the violence
visited upon me.

43:23.518 --> 43:26.269
And now at last
I am free from my anger,

43:27.230 --> 43:28.897
saved from my nightmares.

43:32.068 --> 43:34.027
And, finally, I know who I am.

43:36.322 --> 43:38.031
And so, my dear,

43:39.075 --> 43:40.867
let us celebrate our alliance,

43:42.870 --> 43:45.914
and drink to victory
over my abusers.

43:47.375 --> 43:51.378
My dear sister,
you have saved me.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.172
I love you.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.553
How I've always loved you.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.057
Yes.

44:06.727 --> 44:08.353
Salutations, my love.

44:33.754 --> 44:34.754
Burgred!

45:29.644 --> 45:32.187
My lords,
ladies and gentlemen,

45:32.813 --> 45:38.652
please rise and raise
your cups to the sole
and only ruler of Mercia.

45:47.954 --> 45:49.663
To the Queen of Mercia.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.707
To the Queen.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.335
To the Queen.

46:35.376 --> 46:36.876
Why so quiet?

46:38.129 --> 46:39.713
Nothing to talk about?

46:41.257 --> 46:42.799
Not with you, perhaps.

46:44.552 --> 46:46.386
So you are tired
of me already?

46:48.347 --> 46:51.808
Not to worry.
It is time for me
to be on my way.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.605
I am never anywhere too long.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.108
I'm too restless.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.325
The boy is well.

47:11.412 --> 47:14.914
In future, I doubt he will
suffer such pains as before.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.918
I've taken some of his pains
upon myself.

47:22.715 --> 47:25.342
And your friend Siggy,
she's also very happy.

47:25.926 --> 47:29.554
She's with her husband,
sons, daughter in Valhalla.

47:31.474 --> 47:34.434
If you don't believe me,
you could ask the Seer.

47:37.772 --> 47:39.230
Farewell then.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.485
Who are you?

47:49.950 --> 47:51.910
Just a wanderer.
