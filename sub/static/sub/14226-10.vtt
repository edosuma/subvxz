00:03.365 --> 00:05.342
<i>crash-landed on Earth. We
came here seeking refuge,</i>

00:05.344 --> 00:08.526
<i>but the humans thought
that it was an invasion.</i>

00:08.528 --> 00:11.062
(Rapid gunfire, shouting)

00:11.064 --> 00:14.233
<i>That night, I met a human
girl who tried to protect me...</i>

00:14.235 --> 00:16.473
<i>a girl I never thought I'd see again.</i>

00:16.475 --> 00:18.880
<i>The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,</i>

00:18.882 --> 00:22.558
<i>were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.327
<i>Now it's 2024.</i>

00:24.329 --> 00:26.369
<i>Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school</i>

00:26.419 --> 00:28.892
<i>as a part of a government
integration program.</i>

00:28.942 --> 00:30.480
<i>But the humans and Atrians</i>

00:30.530 --> 00:32.368
<i>continue to distrust each other,</i>

00:32.418 --> 00:35.451
<i>while I fight to protect
my people and the human girl</i>

00:35.501 --> 00:36.424
<i>who saved my life</i>

00:36.474 --> 00:38.281
<i>at any cost.</i>

00:38.283 --> 00:39.853
<i>Previously on Star-Crossed...</i>

00:39.855 --> 00:41.523
<i>CASTOR: My fellow Atrians.</i>

00:41.525 --> 00:43.391
<i>I have learned that Roman</I></i>

00:43.393 --> 00:45.460
<i>has taken up with a human girl.</i>

00:45.462 --> 00:47.129
<i>What else could he be lying about?</i>

00:48.965 --> 00:51.968
Roman saved me with
cyper. If anyone finds out,

00:51.970 --> 00:54.771
<i>I'm back to a life of tubes
and needles, being studied</i>

00:54.773 --> 00:56.038
<i>like a lab rat along with the Atrians.</i>

00:56.040 --> 00:57.972
Help me understand how cyper works.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.639
It stayed in your blood, Julia.

00:59.641 --> 01:01.307
That makes you

01:01.309 --> 01:03.510
the only source of activated cyper.

01:03.512 --> 01:05.312
I have to go.

01:05.313 --> 01:06.746
I know you killed Zoe.

01:06.748 --> 01:08.449
We should kill her.

01:08.451 --> 01:10.185
What do you want?

01:10.187 --> 01:12.588
I'll let you know.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.042 --> 01:29.642
What do you want?

01:39.489 --> 01:42.423
Sweet dreams.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.855
It's done.

02:06.325 --> 02:08.625
Castor took away the one
weapon I had against him:

02:08.627 --> 02:10.392
the trust of our people.

02:10.394 --> 02:12.561
Now a murderer is in charge of the Sector.

02:12.563 --> 02:13.963
The <i>Hwatab</i> will support you.

02:13.965 --> 02:16.033
- A lot of Atrians will.
- Yeah, maybe.

02:16.035 --> 02:17.501
But some also think I betrayed them

02:17.503 --> 02:19.302
by keeping my relationship
with Emery a secret.

02:19.304 --> 02:21.639
Hey, your friends are
still gonna have your back.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.809
Not all of them.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.679
Why wasn't Teri on the bus?

02:25.681 --> 02:27.514
She must've left the Sector early.

02:27.516 --> 02:29.385
I'll see if she's inside.

02:31.908 --> 02:34.108
_

02:34.133 --> 02:36.633
_

02:40.865 --> 02:42.199
Hey!

02:43.901 --> 02:44.934
I heard what you said.

02:44.936 --> 02:46.535
What are you planning?

02:46.537 --> 02:48.638
Shouldn't you be following
around your human girl

02:48.640 --> 02:49.840
like a lost puppy?

02:49.842 --> 02:52.474
Are the Trags targeting Emery?

02:52.476 --> 02:54.576
And why would we do that?

02:55.646 --> 02:57.113
I know you're up to something.

02:57.115 --> 02:59.015
You stay away from her.

03:16.491 --> 03:18.193
Hey.

03:29.239 --> 03:32.107
But if Castor is trying to stop
integration from happening...

03:32.109 --> 03:33.610
I'm not gonna let that happen.

03:33.612 --> 03:35.979
I mean, after everything
we've been through...

03:35.981 --> 03:38.780
black cyper, Trags, Red Hawk thugs...

03:38.782 --> 03:41.218
I think we can handle my uncle.

03:47.991 --> 03:50.094
(Knocking, door opens)

03:50.964 --> 03:52.932
Hey, guys.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.767
You can come out now.

03:54.769 --> 03:57.067
Everybody knows.

03:58.536 --> 04:00.705
(Quiet chatter)

04:08.342 --> 04:10.477
Apparently, an SEU guard
took a video of the hologram

04:10.479 --> 04:11.813
and leaked it online.

04:11.815 --> 04:14.113
Hey, Roman, what are you having for lunch?

04:14.115 --> 04:15.881
I hear Grayson's sloppy
seconds are on the menu.

04:16.982 --> 04:18.180
<i>EMERY: Don't.</i>

04:18.183 --> 04:19.380
Humans, Atrians...

04:19.382 --> 04:20.680
I guess you get down with just about

04:20.683 --> 04:22.583
anyone or anything, won't you?

04:22.585 --> 04:24.886
And yet you can't seem to get with a girl

04:24.888 --> 04:26.555
of any species, can you?

04:29.993 --> 04:32.428
Don't listen to those Neanderthals.

04:32.430 --> 04:35.130
I think what you're doing is really brave.

04:37.132 --> 04:39.167
I'm usually the tastemaker,

04:39.169 --> 04:41.171
but I'm glad you're
paving the way this time.

04:41.173 --> 04:42.406
Thanks, Taylor.

04:43.474 --> 04:45.807
I'll see you guys later.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.593
I said I'd let you know when
I wanted something from you.

04:56.595 --> 04:57.561
I'm not your bitch.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.030
Well, I know you killed Zoe.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.932
I saw your hands around her throat.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.270
You don't have any proof.

05:03.272 --> 05:05.506
Fine. Let's go talk to the cops, huh?

05:05.508 --> 05:07.741
We'll bring Roman. He saw the whole thing

05:07.743 --> 05:09.044
and didn't do a damn thing to stop it.

05:09.046 --> 05:10.882
Roman's innocent in all this.

05:10.884 --> 05:13.119
Maybe, maybe not.

05:13.121 --> 05:14.420
But you sure as hell aren't.

05:14.422 --> 05:16.590
What do you want?

05:16.592 --> 05:20.662
I know there are Atrian
radicals in the Sector.

05:20.664 --> 05:21.763
The ones who blew up that guard's booth

05:21.765 --> 05:22.997
- a couple months ago.
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.999 --> 05:25.933
What do you know about them?

05:25.935 --> 05:28.335
Look, you can talk to me
or you can talk to the cops.

05:28.337 --> 05:29.637
I don't care. It's your call.

05:35.610 --> 05:37.111
Silver lining time.

05:37.113 --> 05:39.682
At least we can sit together during lunch.

05:39.684 --> 05:43.453
Yeah, with our very own paparazzi.

05:43.455 --> 05:46.024
Hey! Shoo, bottom feeders!

05:49.259 --> 05:50.526
I mean, they're different species.

05:50.528 --> 05:52.730
Their babies will probably have flippers.

05:52.732 --> 05:54.699
Nice.

05:55.533 --> 05:56.866
Oh, come on.

05:56.868 --> 05:58.168
It was a joke.

05:58.170 --> 05:59.203
Miss Yeung?

05:59.205 --> 06:02.272
I need to talk with you,
please, in private.

06:12.618 --> 06:15.021
I still can't believe Castor
did this to you, Roman.

06:15.023 --> 06:16.524
Yeah, well,

06:16.526 --> 06:18.627
there's a reason Dad didn't trust him.

06:20.563 --> 06:22.298
May I cut in?

06:23.735 --> 06:25.368
Teri, what the hell?

06:25.370 --> 06:27.470
Accidents happen.

06:35.914 --> 06:37.215
You okay?

06:37.217 --> 06:39.419
Yeah.

07:00.741 --> 07:02.178
(Thunder rumbling)

07:04.583 --> 07:06.583
Julia, you remember Mr. Burke?

07:07.686 --> 07:09.823
What's he doing here?

07:09.825 --> 07:11.994
It's okay, relax. Nothing's
gonna happen to you.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.398
Or your family, as long as you cooperate.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.833
I already told you where to get cyper.

07:16.835 --> 07:18.170
I know. Thank you for that.

07:18.172 --> 07:19.941
We even managed to grow some of our own.

07:19.943 --> 07:21.643
But unfortunately,

07:21.645 --> 07:23.676
the cyper didn't work as we intended.

07:23.678 --> 07:25.577
Mr. Burke?

07:25.579 --> 07:28.347
We administered the cyper to
rats suffering from leukemia.

07:28.349 --> 07:29.647
Just like you were.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.415
But unlike you,

07:31.417 --> 07:32.916
they were not cured. In fact...

07:32.918 --> 07:34.217
<i>BENTON: Cyper killed them.</i>

07:36.020 --> 07:38.088
Maybe cyper didn't cure me after all.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.091
We think that there was
another ingredient as well,

07:41.093 --> 07:42.959
like a catalyzing agent.

07:42.961 --> 07:45.830
Which means that the
answer is in your blood.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.801
No.

07:47.803 --> 07:49.571
I'm not helping you.

07:51.606 --> 07:53.673
Julia?

07:53.675 --> 07:57.009
You really don't want Mr. Burke
paying a visit to your parents.

08:02.283 --> 08:03.849
Hold out your arm, please.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.754
(Bag unzipping)

08:10.590 --> 08:13.825
I called you both here to
tell you that I support you.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.827
But you need to be vigilant.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.365
If anyone threatens you in
any way, you come to me first.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.337
The Red Hawks, obviously...
Screw the Red Hawks.

08:21.339 --> 08:22.937
Just 'cause you let them rule your life

08:22.939 --> 08:24.906
doesn't mean I'm gonna let them rule mine.

08:26.910 --> 08:29.712
Roman, she just wants us to be careful.

08:29.714 --> 08:30.713
No.

08:30.715 --> 08:33.284
She wants us to be in hiding.

08:33.287 --> 08:35.755
That's how you like it, right?
Secret and under control?

08:35.756 --> 08:38.789
One of these days, I hope
you'll learn to trust me, Roman.

08:38.791 --> 08:41.089
(Phone ringing)

08:41.091 --> 08:42.859
Yes, Saul?

08:42.861 --> 08:45.296
Are you sure?

08:45.298 --> 08:47.096
<i>(Distorted): Yes, I understand.</i>

08:47.098 --> 08:49.065
Effective immediately.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.705
There's a hurricane coming our way.

08:51.707 --> 08:53.205
A hurricane?

08:53.207 --> 08:56.038
Marshall High is now on lockdown.

09:07.194 --> 09:10.094
<i>REPORTER: An unseasonable
hurricane has hit Louisiana,</i>

09:10.096 --> 09:12.097
<i>mystifying meteorologists as it slams</i>

09:12.099 --> 09:14.200
<i>the southeastern part of the state.</i>

09:14.202 --> 09:15.902
I've been put in charge of wrangling

09:15.904 --> 09:17.704
all the students in the cafeteria.

09:17.706 --> 09:20.672
It's too late for me to leave.

09:20.674 --> 09:23.908
Can I test Julia's blood sample here?

09:23.910 --> 09:26.375
Yeah. In the lab.

09:26.377 --> 09:28.344
Third floor.

09:28.346 --> 09:30.380
Keep me up to date.

09:30.382 --> 09:32.584
Got to go play teacher.

09:34.551 --> 09:36.252
Are you worried about your parents?

09:36.254 --> 09:37.884
No.

09:37.934 --> 09:40.154
They grew up here, so they're
pretty used to this stuff.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.712
You know, I'm more concerned

09:41.762 --> 09:43.532
that this hurricane came out of nowhere.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.662
I mean, usually we have days to prepare,

09:45.664 --> 09:48.234
and we've never had one
this time of the year.

09:48.236 --> 09:49.568
I, uh, thought I might go

09:49.570 --> 09:51.401
check out some better satellite images.

09:53.939 --> 09:56.140
You want some help?

09:56.142 --> 09:57.977
Yeah, sure.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.514
Hey, everybody, listening up, please.

10:02.516 --> 10:03.949
You need to stay away from the windows

10:03.951 --> 10:05.450
and the glass doors.

10:05.452 --> 10:08.185
And you're permitted
on the first floor only.

10:10.156 --> 10:12.425
We can't let Grayson go to the police.

10:12.427 --> 10:15.129
Even if we don't get locked up,
the Trags could get wind of it,

10:15.131 --> 10:17.364
find out that we ruined
their black cyper plan.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.702
Grayson's not gonna go
to the police right away.

10:19.704 --> 10:21.071
He wants the information on

10:21.073 --> 10:22.640
what the Trags are planning for himself.

10:22.642 --> 10:25.007
Probably wants to get
us all sent to the Crate.

10:25.009 --> 10:26.608
You know, you were right.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.343
We should've just let Zoe kill him.

10:31.184 --> 10:33.087
All right, we'll just, uh...

10:33.089 --> 10:34.687
we'll-we'll find a way to deal with him.

10:34.689 --> 10:36.322
Just keep buying time.

10:38.092 --> 10:39.360
Have you seen Teri?

10:39.362 --> 10:40.564
No. Why?

10:40.566 --> 10:42.199
She's up to something.

10:42.201 --> 10:44.001
I think she's after Emery.

10:46.471 --> 10:49.072
<i>GRAYSON: Hey.</i>

10:49.074 --> 10:50.841
I know things are weird
between us right now,

10:50.843 --> 10:51.976
and that's gonna make it harder

10:51.978 --> 10:53.880
for you to hear what I have to say.

10:55.016 --> 10:56.182
It's about Roman.

10:57.552 --> 10:58.754
You can't trust him.

10:58.756 --> 11:00.190
- Grayson...
- There are things you don't know

11:00.192 --> 11:02.192
about him; he has secrets.

11:02.194 --> 11:03.629
Not from me he doesn't.

11:03.631 --> 11:04.865
Look, you can't...

11:04.867 --> 11:06.700
It's not safe to be around him.

11:08.536 --> 11:11.637
Let her go.

11:11.639 --> 11:13.972
- Touch her again, I'll kill you!
- Stop, stop, stop!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.406
The guards see you throw the first punch,

11:15.408 --> 11:16.507
they'll be all over you.

11:24.453 --> 11:26.689
Still think he's not dangerous?

11:27.525 --> 11:29.760
What was that about?

11:29.762 --> 11:31.593
He grabbed your arm.

11:31.595 --> 11:33.497
Have you seen Teri?

11:33.499 --> 11:36.002
Roman, what is going
on? You have to tell me.

11:36.004 --> 11:37.971
No, no, no. I need to find Teri.

11:40.273 --> 11:41.541
Hey.

11:41.543 --> 11:44.046
All these dark empty classrooms.

11:44.048 --> 11:45.348
(Chuckles)

11:45.350 --> 11:47.017
Whatever will we do with ourselves?

11:47.019 --> 11:48.384
Now's not a good time.

11:48.386 --> 11:49.885
- If we get caught...
- Oh, please.

11:49.887 --> 11:51.187
Is it really all that taboo

11:51.189 --> 11:53.290
now that Roman and Emery are out?

11:53.292 --> 11:56.062
Yeah. I mean, look at the
welcome party they're getting.

11:56.064 --> 11:58.062
Need I remind you,

11:58.064 --> 12:00.661
we were the ones on the cutting edge.

12:00.663 --> 12:03.331
I say...

12:03.333 --> 12:05.568
we start acting like it.

12:05.570 --> 12:07.535
(Inhales sharply)

12:07.537 --> 12:09.138
(Both chuckle)

12:10.608 --> 12:12.743
Find me later, okay?

12:12.745 --> 12:14.779
Yeah.

12:22.126 --> 12:23.959
(Thunder rumbling)

12:40.943 --> 12:43.009
What did you do to Roman?

12:43.011 --> 12:44.775
Can you be more specific?

12:44.777 --> 12:47.313
He's got a hair-trigger
temper all of a sudden.

12:47.315 --> 12:49.381
Acting on impulse.

12:50.416 --> 12:52.616
I can recognize a <i>vatal</i> trip

12:52.618 --> 12:53.750
when I see one.

12:53.752 --> 12:55.514
And why would I drug Roman?

12:55.516 --> 12:58.952
To get back at him for
taking up with Emery.

12:58.954 --> 13:00.320
Admit it, you're jealous.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.619
Jealous? Of that unmarked insect?

13:01.621 --> 13:03.052
Please.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.286
Roman thought you were up to
something for the Trags today.

13:07.288 --> 13:09.853
And you're not a Trag anymore.

13:20.764 --> 13:22.833
(Door closes)

13:22.835 --> 13:24.601
I got your text message. What's up?

13:24.603 --> 13:26.703
Atrian leukocytes.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.871
That's the catalyst.

13:28.873 --> 13:32.141
For conclusive results,
I would need Atrian blood.

13:32.143 --> 13:33.942
A lot of it.

13:33.944 --> 13:36.578
I'd practically need to drain one dry.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.248
Okay, well,

13:40.250 --> 13:41.582
we've got seven Atrians

13:41.584 --> 13:43.483
stuck under this roof to choose from.

13:45.352 --> 13:47.752
Pick one.

13:58.167 --> 14:00.200
Does Taylor know she's sleeping with

14:00.202 --> 14:02.235
the guy who killed her best friend?

14:04.238 --> 14:05.873
She's a friend of mine.

14:05.875 --> 14:07.609
I think she should know the truth.

14:07.611 --> 14:08.877
Don't you?

14:08.879 --> 14:10.244
You don't want to do that.

14:10.246 --> 14:11.780
Then give me something.

14:11.782 --> 14:14.383
(Sighs)

14:16.652 --> 14:19.990
You know those Atrian radicals
you were worried about?

14:19.992 --> 14:21.394
They're called the Trags.

14:21.396 --> 14:23.229
Roman and I... we're trying to stop them.

14:23.231 --> 14:25.828
So I'm supposed to believe
you're the good guys?

14:25.830 --> 14:27.830
And Zoe was, what?

14:27.832 --> 14:29.031
Collateral damage?

14:29.033 --> 14:30.399
You can believe what you want.

14:30.401 --> 14:31.600
It's the truth.

14:31.602 --> 14:33.569
Then give me a name.

14:33.571 --> 14:36.005
Someone who knows the Trags' plan.

14:37.942 --> 14:40.578
I don't have a name for you.

14:42.748 --> 14:45.248
There are six other Atrians
in this school, Drake.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.650
I suggest you start asking around,

14:46.652 --> 14:49.118
get me a name by the end of the day.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.819
Oh, and...

14:52.821 --> 14:56.124
unless you want me to
tell the cops and Taylor

14:56.126 --> 14:59.162
everything I know about Zoe,

14:59.164 --> 15:01.529
you need to end it with her.

15:01.531 --> 15:04.668
'Cause I won't have her
become collateral damage, too.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.251
<i>EMERY: Roman.</i>

15:20.253 --> 15:23.088
Why are you looking for Teri?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.492
She is up to something. I know it.

15:25.494 --> 15:27.360
It's just that every time I look for her,

15:27.362 --> 15:28.995
I keep feeling like something's
going to happen to you, and...

15:28.997 --> 15:32.300
and just... I'm so turned around.

15:33.136 --> 15:34.803
Okay. Come with me.

15:34.805 --> 15:36.304
- Come on.
- What?

15:41.276 --> 15:42.742
(Door closes)

15:42.744 --> 15:44.477
Roman.

15:44.479 --> 15:47.246
Roman... look at me.

15:47.248 --> 15:49.049
Tell me what's going on.

15:52.951 --> 15:54.385
Slow down.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.155
I just want you so bad.

15:59.057 --> 16:00.489
(Emery grunts)

16:00.491 --> 16:02.259
Okay, you need to cool off.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.764
I need some air.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.543
(Thunder rumbling)

16:13.545 --> 16:16.113
Emery. Emery!

16:16.115 --> 16:17.582
Have you talked to Julia today?

16:17.584 --> 16:19.786
Um, not since this morning. Why?

16:19.788 --> 16:21.423
I said something stupid,

16:21.425 --> 16:23.361
and... now she's avoiding me.

16:23.363 --> 16:25.900
Could you check on her, maybe?

16:34.377 --> 16:36.209
I don't know what Eric said,

16:36.211 --> 16:37.876
but I think this hurricane
is officially making

16:37.878 --> 16:40.042
every boy in this school go insane.

16:41.246 --> 16:42.447
You okay?

16:42.449 --> 16:45.014
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

16:45.016 --> 16:48.250
Okay, you most definitely are not.

16:49.952 --> 16:51.285
What is that?

16:52.554 --> 16:54.458
Is that a needle mark?

16:54.460 --> 16:55.894
Jules, what is going on?

16:55.896 --> 16:57.898
I can't tell you.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.732
Yes, you can.

17:02.704 --> 17:04.973
No, you have to keep this between us.

17:08.010 --> 17:09.646
It's Miss Benton.

17:09.648 --> 17:10.883
She's only working here

17:10.885 --> 17:12.617
so she can get closer to the Atrians

17:12.618 --> 17:14.318
so she can figure out the secret of cyper.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.988
Does she know you were cured by cyper?

17:17.990 --> 17:19.257
But she doesn't know that

17:19.259 --> 17:21.126
Roman has to mix it with his blood.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.729
At least not yet.

17:22.731 --> 17:25.095
Her associate just took a sample of mine.

17:25.097 --> 17:26.229
I'm sorry.

17:26.231 --> 17:27.897
I should have told you weeks ago.

17:27.900 --> 17:29.335
I was just so scared.

17:30.435 --> 17:31.834
They threatened to poison my dad.

17:31.836 --> 17:33.503
Em, I don't know what to do.

17:33.505 --> 17:35.540
It's okay.

17:35.542 --> 17:39.010
You're not in this alone anymore.

17:39.012 --> 17:41.079
We'll fix it.

17:41.081 --> 17:42.547
How?

17:52.797 --> 17:55.230
Oh, good, you're here.

17:55.232 --> 17:56.999
I've been thinking.

17:57.001 --> 17:59.102
Marshall's Winter Blast is coming up.

17:59.104 --> 18:01.772
What better way to announce
our coming out as a couple

18:01.774 --> 18:03.674
than a choreographed dance number?

18:03.676 --> 18:06.478
I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.181
Oh, no, sure you are.

18:08.183 --> 18:09.383
Come on, Twinkle Toes.

18:09.385 --> 18:11.119
Mm, mm, show me what you got.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.354
- Mm, mm...
- Stop, stop. Listen to me.

18:15.292 --> 18:16.960
I don't want this.

18:16.962 --> 18:19.731
What are you talking about?

18:19.733 --> 18:22.165
After seeing everything

18:22.167 --> 18:24.501
that Roman and Emery have to deal with...

18:24.503 --> 18:26.572
uh...

18:26.574 --> 18:28.075
I can't.

18:28.077 --> 18:29.275
I'm sorry. It's over.

18:29.277 --> 18:31.376
Drake, wait.

18:34.617 --> 18:38.250
I know that it's not supposed to be easy,

18:38.252 --> 18:41.786
but some things are worth
fighting for, aren't they?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.755
Yeah, they are.

18:46.388 --> 18:48.758
I just don't think...

18:48.760 --> 18:51.062
you and me are worth fighting for.

18:54.298 --> 18:56.866
Drake...

18:58.768 --> 19:02.204
The storm is moving south through Edendale,

19:02.206 --> 19:03.538
but check out these images.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.072
Look where it formed.

19:07.007 --> 19:09.609
Right above the Atrian ship?

19:11.378 --> 19:13.244
Your ship couldn't have
created this, right?

19:14.245 --> 19:15.545
I mean, that's crazy.

19:15.547 --> 19:16.913
The ship has

19:16.915 --> 19:18.448
artificial gravity generators.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.183
If they got activated somehow

19:20.185 --> 19:21.417
and directed outward,

19:21.419 --> 19:23.717
it could create an area of low pressure.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.688
Do you think it's some sort of malfunction?

19:28.690 --> 19:30.689
<i>LUKAS: It has to be.</i>

19:30.691 --> 19:32.989

20:38.592 --> 20:39.924
(Distorted): Roman, it's important.

20:39.926 --> 20:41.692
Miss Benton took Julia's blood.

20:41.694 --> 20:43.496
She's trying to figure out how cyper works.

20:43.498 --> 20:44.732
What?

20:44.734 --> 20:46.366
If she... if she has Julia's blood,

20:46.368 --> 20:48.500
then she has everything.

20:48.502 --> 20:51.337
Well, then we need to
figure out a way to stop her

20:51.339 --> 20:52.705

Any time that I have to pick between you

21:10.826 --> 21:12.925
and what's best for the
Atrians, I always choose you,

21:12.927 --> 21:14.829
and that's always the wrong choice.

21:14.831 --> 21:17.600
I never asked you to do any of that.

No, you're right.

Fine. Don't help me.

But do yourself a favor
and go find someplace quiet

21:29.251 --> 21:31.252

25:56.394 --> 25:58.397
(Gasps softly)

26:01.068 --> 26:02.501
Hello, there.

26:04.036 --> 26:05.904
(Grunting)

26:12.179 --> 26:14.447
(Burke whistling a tune)

26:27.625 --> 26:29.493
(Whistling continues)

26:39.435 --> 26:42.136
Hey.

26:42.138 --> 26:44.272
Brock's in the cafeteria recruiting guys

26:44.274 --> 26:46.276
for a new and improved Red Hawks.

26:46.278 --> 26:47.445
He says it's your idea.

26:47.447 --> 26:49.248
I was gonna talk to you about this.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.614
You're serious?

26:50.616 --> 26:52.818
I got the inside track
with the Atrians, okay?

26:52.820 --> 26:54.286
Found out about this terrorist group...

26:54.288 --> 26:55.486
they're called the Trags.

26:55.488 --> 26:56.787
And you know this how?

26:56.789 --> 26:58.121
I just do.

26:58.123 --> 26:59.721
Just trust me, okay?

26:59.723 --> 27:01.792
And that's why I'm starting this new group.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.124
Forget the old Red Hawks,

27:04.126 --> 27:06.056
with their hate and their violence.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.823
Now we can focus on
what's really important:

27:07.825 --> 27:10.425
what these Trags are up to.

27:10.427 --> 27:12.193
The last time I ran with the Red Hawks,

27:12.195 --> 27:13.628
I almost wound up in jail.

27:13.630 --> 27:15.398
You were the one that
convinced me to get out.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.801
That's before I knew the truth.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.203
Some of these Atrians can't be trusted.

27:18.205 --> 27:20.435
For all we know, they've already started

27:20.437 --> 27:22.336
their plan against the humans.

27:22.338 --> 27:24.336
Grayson, your parents were the
leaders of the old Red Hawks,

27:24.338 --> 27:26.838
and now your mom's behind bars.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.873
I don't want to see you go
down the same road as her.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.873
The threat is real, okay?

27:30.875 --> 27:33.639
And if you don't see that, fine.

27:33.641 --> 27:36.243
But don't try and stop me.

27:45.648 --> 27:48.748
(Whispering): She'll
die if he doesn't stop.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.351
We have to do something.

27:50.353 --> 27:51.719
If he sees us, we're dead.

27:51.721 --> 27:54.889
(Phone ringing)

27:57.059 --> 27:58.693
Eva.

27:58.695 --> 28:01.664
Wait, let me find a better signal.

28:06.171 --> 28:07.403
Now.

28:11.007 --> 28:12.908
Teri, wake up. Can you hear me? It's Emery.

28:12.910 --> 28:14.143
We need to hurry.

28:14.145 --> 28:16.413
Help get her up. Come on.

28:35.219 --> 28:36.685

28:36.687 --> 28:38.487
You aren't leaving, are you?

28:38.489 --> 28:39.921
Let us go.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.223
Run!

28:46.225 --> 28:48.257
Go!

28:48.259 --> 28:49.592

29:03.372 --> 29:05.272
Please! Somebody help!

29:06.674 --> 29:08.075

29:16.087 --> 29:17.055
That's enough!

29:17.057 --> 29:18.158
Roman!

29:18.160 --> 29:19.894
That's enough! Roman!

29:19.896 --> 29:22.463
That's enough.

29:22.465 --> 29:25.001
Look at me.

29:33.378 --> 29:35.647
We'll tell Gloria what we found.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.385
She'll call the National Guard,
and they'll go to the ship

29:38.387 --> 29:39.822
and shut down the gravitational field.

29:39.824 --> 29:41.124
Lukas, wait.

29:42.092 --> 29:43.359
Maybe we shouldn't.

29:43.361 --> 29:44.763
What if it's not an accident?

29:44.765 --> 29:47.368
What if someone wanted to cause the storm?

29:47.370 --> 29:49.538
I mean, only an Atrian
knows how to do that.

29:49.540 --> 29:51.308
And all the Atrians are in the Sector,

29:51.310 --> 29:52.609
except for the Seven.

29:56.747 --> 29:58.447
Wait.

29:58.449 --> 30:01.383
Are-are you telling me that
one of the Seven is a terrorist?

30:01.385 --> 30:03.253
I don't know.

30:03.255 --> 30:07.224
But if it is an Atrian and
the truth comes out, then...

30:07.226 --> 30:09.629
no more Integration Program.

30:09.631 --> 30:10.864
No more freedom.

30:10.866 --> 30:12.933
They could send us all to the Crate.

30:12.935 --> 30:14.603
Look, I don't want that to happen,

30:14.605 --> 30:16.639
but this storm is tearing up my town.

30:16.641 --> 30:18.074
We can't sit back and do nothing.

30:18.076 --> 30:20.511

30:20.513 --> 30:22.982

Just wait ten minutes.

30:28.822 --> 30:31.223
If it doesn't clear, you can call Gloria.

30:33.722 --> 30:36.185

30:48.295 --> 30:49.998
I just went looking for Mr. Burke,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.599
and I found the lab destroyed.

30:51.601 --> 30:53.700
You know anything about that?

30:53.702 --> 30:55.866
I'm not helping you anymore.

30:55.868 --> 30:58.302
I saw what Burke did to Teri. It's over.

I'd keep quiet about what...

31:02.211 --> 31:03.243
<i>GLORIA: Miss Benton!</i>

31:08.648 --> 31:10.481

31:10.483 --> 31:11.850
so yes, I'd say there is.

31:11.852 --> 31:13.253

Mr. Burke on the hook for extortion,

31:15.393 --> 31:16.525
kidnapping, attempted murder.

31:16.527 --> 31:18.025
And by being complicit

31:18.027 --> 31:19.892
in assaulting an Atrian student,

31:19.894 --> 31:23.028
you just became a national security risk.

39:55.990 --> 39:57.558
We can find out what they're gonna do,

39:57.560 --> 39:58.959
and we can stop them.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.527
And we won't rest until every Atrian

40:01.529 --> 40:06.232
that wants to hurt us is rooted
out and brought to justice.

40:06.234 --> 40:08.666
We're the New Red Hawks.

40:12.875 --> 40:14.075
I was right about Teri.

40:14.077 --> 40:15.710
She and the Trags were up to something,

40:15.712 --> 40:17.312
but it has nothing to do with Emery.

40:17.314 --> 40:19.915
Those are the guys I saw
her with this morning.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.618
The <i>vatal</i> kept me from seeing the truth.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.852
The Trags were using
the hurricane as a cover.

40:24.854 --> 40:26.220
They created a storm

40:26.222 --> 40:28.222
so that the hidden Trags
could smuggle things

40:28.224 --> 40:29.191
into the Sector?

40:29.193 --> 40:30.529
The question is: what for?

40:30.531 --> 40:33.465
When my mom returned to the Sector,

40:33.467 --> 40:35.099
Vega wanted her to build something

40:35.101 --> 40:37.903
called the <i>Suvek</i> for the
Trags, but she refused.

40:37.905 --> 40:41.607
<i>Suvek</i>... that means blast or flash.

40:41.609 --> 40:43.776
You think it's some kind of bomb?

40:43.826 --> 40:45.740
If it is, it's a big one.

40:45.790 --> 40:46.935
The way my mom talked,

40:46.985 --> 40:48.815
she said that this <i>Suvek</i> is gonna kick off

40:48.865 --> 40:50.835
the Trags' war against the humans.

40:52.257 --> 40:54.273
The Trags might have started building it,

40:54.323 --> 40:57.711
but it's up to us to make
sure they don't finish.

40:58.754 --> 41:03.754
