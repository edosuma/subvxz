WEBVTT

00:10.068 --> 00:13.137
[mechanical whirring]

00:18.586 --> 00:20.931
- So that's what Sasquatch
has been after this whole time?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.172
- Apparently so.

00:22.241 --> 00:23.793
- Then let's not
keep them apart.

00:23.862 --> 00:25.689
- Davis, hold on.

00:25.758 --> 00:27.068
Hold on.
- For what?

00:27.137 --> 00:28.655
There's no fight
until we give this back.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.379
And if there's no fight,
then I'm in deep shit.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.551
- Look, give me that.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.241
Look, we are gonna
give it back.

00:33.310 --> 00:34.931
But I want to find out

00:35.000 --> 00:37.379
what's so important
to our little buddy.

00:39.172 --> 00:42.413
[mechanical whirring]

00:42.482 --> 00:43.793
Okay, do it.

00:47.413 --> 00:48.724
- Okay.

00:48.793 --> 00:49.827
- What kinda language
do you think that is?

00:49.896 --> 00:52.517
- "Keep the fuck out" language.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.517
- Hang on.

00:56.103 --> 00:57.689
Let me try something.

01:00.931 --> 01:03.068
- Give it up.

01:03.137 --> 01:04.965
We're giving this
to Sasquatch now.

01:05.034 --> 01:07.103
- What's the hurry?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.379
- It's from the bank.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.862
They're gonna take possession
of my family's house

01:15.931 --> 01:19.068
to pay the hospital
for my mom's cancer treatments.

01:19.137 --> 01:21.793
- That's a fuckload of zeroes.

01:21.862 --> 01:25.517
- The last letter was yellow.
This one is orange.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.965
It's like they're raising the
terror threat level on my life.

01:29.034 --> 01:31.310
Next letter's
gonna have anthrax in it.

01:37.896 --> 01:39.793
- Let's go find Sasquatch.

01:42.793 --> 01:44.724
- Colonel Austin wants
to see you two

01:44.793 --> 01:46.827
in his office right now.

01:47.655 --> 01:50.310
- Promotions?
- We did save the day.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.517
- Your whole crew is grounded.
Effective immediately.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.620
- Sir?
- Hang on.

02:03.689 --> 02:05.793
I'm sorry,
but the last time I checked,

02:05.862 --> 02:08.310
we acquired a shitload
of lifesaving morphine

02:08.379 --> 02:09.827
in some pretty
dangerous conditions.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.724
- You also pissed off
my superior and his superior.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.965
Whatever you did
got SecCorp paying attention,

02:15.034 --> 02:17.241
and now they've got Washington
paying attention,

02:17.310 --> 02:18.862
and people who matter
are demanding

02:18.931 --> 02:20.862
I take action against you--
- Sir, I don't understand.

02:20.931 --> 02:23.448
We got the drugs
with no help from SecCorp.

02:23.517 --> 02:25.586
- People who shouldn't
even know you exist

02:25.655 --> 02:27.517
are now keenly aware of you.

02:27.586 --> 02:29.379
- What does that mean, Sir?

02:29.448 --> 02:32.310
- It means your entire military
careers are in jeopardy.

02:32.379 --> 02:34.310
- Welcome to the party, men.

02:34.379 --> 02:35.965
- Besides being grounded,
you'll be losing

02:36.034 --> 02:39.379
all base privileges and be
on cleanup and KP duty as well.

02:39.448 --> 02:41.586
Hopefully that'll appease
all these people

02:41.655 --> 02:43.379
I got burrowing up my ass.

02:43.448 --> 02:45.000
- Who's gonna replace us, sir?

02:45.068 --> 02:47.448
- Oh, they're sending in
a new crew.

02:47.517 --> 02:49.275
Oh, and you're all losing pay.

02:49.344 --> 02:50.517
- Losing pay--

02:50.586 --> 02:51.793
- You should consider
yourself lucky

02:51.862 --> 02:53.103
you're not spending time
in the brig, Davis.

02:53.172 --> 02:54.896
- Is that still an option?

02:54.965 --> 02:56.000
'Cause I'd much rather
do that than--

02:56.068 --> 02:57.275
- Shut the fuck up, dude.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.448
Apologies for
the language, sir.

02:58.517 --> 03:00.655
- Sir, I wasn't
on that mission.

03:00.724 --> 03:02.758
- Sergeant, you're
going down with this ship

03:02.827 --> 03:04.551
even though you were not
a party to this.

03:04.620 --> 03:06.517
And by the way, you've done
excellent work recently.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.517
That's just how shit rolls
in the Army.

03:08.586 --> 03:10.310
Feel free
to take it up privately

03:10.379 --> 03:13.068
with your husband later.

03:13.137 --> 03:14.827
Now this base needs
to be put back together

03:14.896 --> 03:16.448
after that mortar attack,

03:16.517 --> 03:19.172
and you're just the soldiers
in deep shit to do it.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.689
Dismissed.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.689
[door opens]

03:29.137 --> 03:30.758
- Fucking bullshit.

03:30.827 --> 03:32.689
I'm back to scrubbing toilets.
Thank you very much.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.206
- Look, we had
no way of knowing

03:34.275 --> 03:36.034
that this was gonna come back
and bite us in the ass.

03:36.103 --> 03:38.137
- Everything you do comes back
to bite you in the ass.

03:38.206 --> 03:39.586
- No point in arguing.
- Yes, there is.

03:39.655 --> 03:41.448
It's making me feel better.

03:41.517 --> 03:42.793
- You know that call came in

03:42.862 --> 03:45.275
from the Under goddamn
Secretary of Defense.

03:45.344 --> 03:47.241
I have never put through a call

03:47.310 --> 03:49.000
that high up the chain
of command before.

03:49.068 --> 03:51.103
You all are damn lucky you're
not being court marshaled.

03:51.172 --> 03:54.275
- I don't feel lucky.
- Under Secretary of Defense?

03:54.344 --> 03:56.379
SecCorp took this
all the way to the top.

03:56.448 --> 03:58.275
- That's not good.
- To him it is.

03:58.344 --> 04:00.827
- No, this isn't
about that morphine.

04:00.896 --> 04:02.965
This is about shit we saw out
there in the middle of nowhere.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.275
- Whatever it's about,
we need to watch it.

04:05.344 --> 04:07.620
This is major shit
we're stepping in.

04:07.689 --> 04:09.724
- And I didn't even step in it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.413
- Bright side, future grounds
for your eventual divorce.

04:22.172 --> 04:25.034
[indistinct chatter]

04:31.482 --> 04:33.551
- Sorry to interrupt.

04:35.379 --> 04:37.344
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

04:37.413 --> 04:39.758
I lost my gym privileges.
- [scoffs]

04:39.827 --> 04:41.793
- Thought you'd get
a kick outta that.

04:43.344 --> 04:46.413
So, look.
I brought you something.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.655
I didn't have time
to attach a personal note.

04:56.517 --> 04:58.379
- Transaction over.
- Okay.

04:58.448 --> 05:00.103
I'm happy to leave.

05:00.172 --> 05:02.068
But I just want to know
we're on the same page.

05:02.137 --> 05:03.413
- We're on the same page.

05:03.482 --> 05:04.896
- And so I'm clear,
that's the page

05:04.965 --> 05:06.448
where you agree to fight
the Warlord's bodyguard, right?

05:06.517 --> 05:09.586
- Where I'm from,
we keep our promises.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.103
- It's a pretty big operation
you guys got going on out there

05:14.172 --> 05:15.586
in the middle of nowhere.

05:18.206 --> 05:19.896
- What operation?

05:21.137 --> 05:23.620
- [chuckles]
Okay.

05:23.689 --> 05:25.965
I get it.
Top secret.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.482
My lips are sealed.

05:27.551 --> 05:29.241
- You're not supposed
to be here.

05:29.310 --> 05:30.965
- I was just talking
some business.

05:31.034 --> 05:33.310
- What business?
- Don't worry about it.

05:33.379 --> 05:35.517
No distractions today, babe.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.413
- [laughs]
Later, babe.

05:39.586 --> 05:42.827
- You ready?
- Left my dad's balls ready.

05:42.896 --> 05:47.517
[exhaling]
- Hot, strong.

05:47.586 --> 05:49.827
Agile.
Where does her talent end?

05:49.896 --> 05:52.034
- Dude.
- I'm positive reinforcement.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.896
- You can't talk
over all the footage, okay?

05:53.965 --> 05:55.448
I'm sending this
to stunt coordinators.

05:55.517 --> 05:56.793
This is important.

05:56.862 --> 05:58.137
This could be my ticket
out of the military,

05:58.206 --> 05:59.724
so just please
take it seriously.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.965
- Got it.

06:03.517 --> 06:05.689
- [exhaling]

06:05.758 --> 06:08.000
[sighs]
Fuck.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.275
I just, I feel like I should be
sparring with an actual person,

06:10.344 --> 06:11.827
not a camera.

06:11.896 --> 06:14.344
- Me?
- You scared?

06:14.413 --> 06:15.896
- No, ma'am.

06:17.482 --> 06:20.586
[indistinct chatter]

06:26.758 --> 06:28.275
- How come no one's stopping?

06:28.344 --> 06:32.034
These people need medical care.
I'm giving medical care.

06:34.413 --> 06:37.517
Hmm, you sure that this sign
is printed correctly?

06:37.586 --> 06:40.379
That says "free medical care"?
- Yes.

06:40.448 --> 06:42.551
- In Pashto?
- Yes.

06:42.620 --> 06:43.965
- Maybe we should
make it bigger.

06:44.034 --> 06:46.413
- It is big enough.

06:46.482 --> 06:49.034
- Ah.

06:49.103 --> 06:51.034
You're the first person
to get this close.

06:51.103 --> 06:53.931
- We are slow to warm up
to people with guns.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.965
- These troops are here
for your protection.

06:57.034 --> 06:58.758
- When you leave,
will you take them with you?

06:58.827 --> 06:59.896
- Of course.

06:59.965 --> 07:02.655
- Then they are here
for your protection.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.137
- You have this
very irksome way

07:05.206 --> 07:08.034
of turning everything I say
around on me.

07:08.103 --> 07:09.551
- It is a gift.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.758
- [sighs]
Wanna be my first walk-in?

07:11.827 --> 07:14.724
- Someone will have to be.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.620
- She's fine.

07:27.689 --> 07:29.482
- I just said she looks tired.

07:29.551 --> 07:30.689
- You mean I look like shit.

07:30.758 --> 07:32.137
- Worry less about us, son,

07:32.206 --> 07:34.620
and more about staying safe
over there.

07:34.689 --> 07:36.068
How are things
in the hot zone?

07:36.137 --> 07:38.827
- Things are about
to be a whole lot better.

07:38.896 --> 07:41.103
I'm about to be flush
with cash soon.

07:41.172 --> 07:42.827
I'll be able to finally
get those motherfuckers

07:42.896 --> 07:44.206
from the bank off your back.

07:44.275 --> 07:46.482
- All this language.
Your fault.

07:46.551 --> 07:48.689
- Flush with cash, how?

07:48.758 --> 07:50.103
- It's complicated.

07:50.172 --> 07:51.517
- Don't worry
about the bank, son.

07:51.586 --> 07:52.517
We talked to them.

07:52.586 --> 07:53.965
- You did?
When?

07:54.034 --> 07:55.517
- It doesn't matter.
We worked it all out.

07:55.586 --> 07:57.103
- Exactly how
did you work it out?

07:57.172 --> 07:59.000
- We don't wanna bother you
with legalities.

07:59.068 --> 08:00.724
You got more important things
to think about.

08:00.793 --> 08:03.000
Just stay safe over there.

08:03.068 --> 08:04.862
- Okay, but I need you
to tell me exactly--

08:04.931 --> 08:06.896
- You're gonna have to end
that call and leave, Sergeant.

08:06.965 --> 08:08.620
- Yeah, in a second--
- No, right now.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.034
You're on
the no privilege list.

08:10.103 --> 08:11.448
- What's he talking about,
no privilege?

08:11.517 --> 08:12.689
- Nothing, Ma.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.965
I'll be off
in a second, Private.

08:14.034 --> 08:15.551
- I'm gonna have
to terminate this call now.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.000
- And I'm gonna have to
terminate your fucking finger.

08:18.068 --> 08:20.103
- Everything all right, son? What's going on there?

08:20.172 --> 08:21.931
- Everything is fine, Ma.
What about--

08:24.172 --> 08:26.931
- Look, if you leave right now,
I won't report you.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.068
Otherwise--
- I'm gone.

08:29.137 --> 08:31.068
- All right.
- I'm going.

08:34.482 --> 08:36.586
[computer beeps]

08:38.517 --> 08:40.068
- [blows]

08:40.137 --> 08:43.655
Okay, so there are two tricks
when throwing a stunt punch.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.103
The first is distance

08:45.172 --> 08:47.620
so you don't actually
hit the other person.

08:47.689 --> 08:48.862
[exhales]

08:48.931 --> 08:50.482
Camera angles do
most of the work.

08:50.551 --> 08:52.724
But you still have to throw
the punch like it's real.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.413
Hard and fast.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.724
[exhales]
You try.

08:56.793 --> 08:58.413
- [exhales]
- That's it.

08:58.482 --> 09:00.620
But even more important
than that is the end.

09:00.689 --> 09:02.448
You have to really sell it
when it lands.

09:02.517 --> 09:04.965
So when I punch,
you snap your head to the side.

09:05.034 --> 09:05.965
Got it?
Okay?

09:06.034 --> 09:07.275
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:07.344 --> 09:08.482
[exhales]

09:08.551 --> 09:10.620
But really snap.
Do it quicker.

09:10.689 --> 09:11.758
All right?
- Okay.

09:11.827 --> 09:13.379
- [exhales]
Come on, babe.

09:13.448 --> 09:14.517
Snap.
- I'm trying.

09:14.586 --> 09:16.482
- All right.
[exhales]

09:16.551 --> 09:19.482
Okay, new deal.

09:19.551 --> 09:21.965
You try to hit me
this time, okay?

09:22.034 --> 09:23.000
- Okay.

09:25.068 --> 09:26.448
- Good.

09:26.517 --> 09:28.862
[grunting]

09:28.931 --> 09:32.448
- Shit, shit.
Hon, are you okay?

09:32.517 --> 09:34.034
Are you okay?

09:34.103 --> 09:35.379
- Now that's
how you sell it, babe.

09:35.448 --> 09:38.793
both: [laughing]

09:39.344 --> 09:41.034
- How did our adventure
end up all the way

09:41.103 --> 09:42.965
on the Under Secretary
of Defense's desk?

09:43.034 --> 09:44.000
- Easy.

09:44.068 --> 09:47.310
SecCorp has fiends
in high places.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.724
- [groans]

09:48.793 --> 09:50.655
Yeah, but what are they
so afraid of?

09:50.724 --> 09:52.068
What the fuck is
on that blue FOB?

09:52.137 --> 09:55.655
- Who cares?
We got the fight back on.

09:55.724 --> 09:57.344
We got bigger shit
to worry about,

09:57.413 --> 10:00.517
like our boxing ring being a
pile of lumber at the moment.

10:00.586 --> 10:01.655
- I care.

10:01.724 --> 10:02.827
- Well, bringing down Sasquatch

10:02.896 --> 10:04.965
is not gonna get Durkin
back for you.

10:05.034 --> 10:07.137
- Those two things are
completely unrelated, okay?

10:07.206 --> 10:08.827
- Oh, my mistake.

10:08.896 --> 10:10.068
- I'm over Durkin.

10:10.137 --> 10:11.448
I don't even think
about her anymore.

10:11.517 --> 10:13.724
That ship has sailed.
I'm fine with that.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.724
- That's who they sent in
to replace us?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.758
- They brought in the PJs.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.724
- Didn't have to bring in
the LeBron James of medic crews

10:36.793 --> 10:38.034
just to rub it in.

10:38.103 --> 10:40.758
- They're not that hot.
Just beards and biceps.

10:54.275 --> 10:56.517
Can you try and remember
that we're married?

10:56.586 --> 10:58.689
- What?

10:58.758 --> 11:00.517
Fuck you.

11:01.551 --> 11:04.413
- First, the Under Secretary
of Defense grounds us,

11:04.482 --> 11:06.827
then they send in
the fucking PJs to replace us.

11:08.103 --> 11:09.931
Something big's going on.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.896
- And SecCorp is very worried
we're gonna screw it up.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.758
- Well, let's
not disappoint them.

11:20.448 --> 11:21.793
- Not now, fellas.

11:21.862 --> 11:23.689
I'm tending to a real
temperamental gazpacho.

11:23.758 --> 11:25.655
- I hate gazpacho.

11:25.724 --> 11:29.103
- Tell him what he's missing.

11:29.172 --> 11:30.482
- Truth?

11:30.551 --> 11:31.931
- Yeah, of course
the bloody truth.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.862
- I've had better.
- Go fuck yourself.

11:34.931 --> 11:36.758
I'm doing the best I can
making your lunch

11:36.827 --> 11:38.793
out here in the Afghan
bloody wilderness.

11:38.862 --> 11:40.931
Won't even have my kitchen back
until after the big fight.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.655
- Yeah, about that.
We're here to place our bets.

11:43.724 --> 11:45.206
- With what?

11:45.275 --> 11:47.344
I don't see any U.S. presidents
in your hand.

11:47.413 --> 11:49.758
- With the hashish
we gave you as collateral.

11:49.827 --> 11:51.344
- Oh, well, that was
for the last fight,

11:51.413 --> 11:53.586
also known as the slaughter
of Sergeant Roback.

11:53.655 --> 11:55.034
- No, it's for this fight,

11:55.103 --> 11:57.620
also known as the mythical
molly wop of Sasquatch.

11:57.689 --> 11:59.241
- [laughs]
Your word against mine.

11:59.310 --> 12:02.000
- That's out-and-out theft.
- It is, isn't it?

12:03.551 --> 12:06.137
- Whoa.
Hey, stop it.

12:06.206 --> 12:08.689
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- What the fuck, dude?

12:08.758 --> 12:10.034
- I'm sorry, man.
I just snapped.

12:10.103 --> 12:11.620
I got a lot riding on this.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.896
- Look, we don't usually resort
to this kind of behavior,

12:13.965 --> 12:15.896
but you can see how much
this means to us now, okay?

12:15.965 --> 12:17.241
- Here's the deal.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.482
That hashish is gonna be used
as our collateral

12:19.551 --> 12:20.551
for the upcoming fight.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.379
Understood?
- Fuck you.

12:22.448 --> 12:23.896
- He's all yours.

12:23.965 --> 12:25.241
- Okay, fine.
Fine.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.517
We roll it all over
to the big fight, done.

12:27.586 --> 12:29.034
- Put it all on the bodyguard.

12:29.103 --> 12:30.689
- But it won't
do you much good.

12:30.758 --> 12:32.241
- What you talking about?

12:32.310 --> 12:34.965
- You've done too thorough
a job promoting your boy.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.068
Everyone's betting on him now.

12:37.137 --> 12:39.517
Odds are looking like
a fat kid on a seesaw.

12:39.586 --> 12:40.896
No one's betting on Sasquatch.

12:40.965 --> 12:43.931
- No one?
- No, terrible odds.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
All that'll win is pennies
on the dollar, if that.

12:47.172 --> 12:49.103
Why not put it all
on Sasquatch?

12:49.172 --> 12:52.448
Get a bit of excitement
into your life?

12:52.517 --> 12:53.931
The payout would be monumental.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.689
- What are we gonna do?

12:58.758 --> 13:00.310
We bet on our guy,
we win nothing.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.344
We bet on Sasquatch, we lose
everything when our guy wins.

13:03.413 --> 13:06.034
- Let's stick to the plan.
- The plan is FUBAR.

13:06.103 --> 13:07.482
- There is no
good options here.

13:07.551 --> 13:08.896
Anything's better
than losing it all.

13:08.965 --> 13:12.310
- Time's up.
What's it gonna be?

13:12.379 --> 13:14.758
Sometimes long shots
like Sasquatch come through.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.034
And when they do,
fortunes are made.

13:19.068 --> 13:21.482
Then again, you can just do
what your guts tell you.

13:23.551 --> 13:24.862
- We're gonna go with our guy.

13:24.931 --> 13:27.379
- [hisses]
All right.

13:28.655 --> 13:30.103
Oh, not so fast.

13:30.172 --> 13:32.413
I've been told I've got
both of you at my disposal

13:32.482 --> 13:34.310
for KP duty.

13:34.379 --> 13:37.000
So that means
I'm gonna need one of you...

13:37.068 --> 13:41.586
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

13:53.965 --> 13:56.896

13:56.965 --> 13:58.379
There's plenty
of snack money to be made

13:58.448 --> 13:59.896
during the big fight.

13:59.965 --> 14:03.172

you've been through.

14:21.896 --> 14:23.758
You should be dead.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.551
That is what you call us,
is it not?

14:29.620 --> 14:31.482
- It is.

14:31.551 --> 14:34.965
- I would prefer it if from
now on you called me Qasem.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.551

Qasem.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.620

- Efficient and safe?
- American.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.689
It's dangerous
for us to be seen

15:13.758 --> 15:15.793
interacting with Americans.

15:15.862 --> 15:17.482
When you leave,

15:17.551 --> 15:21.137
we have made enemies we cannot
protect ourselves from.

15:21.206 --> 15:24.931
It should not be this way,
but it is.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.448
- These people need help.
I can help.

15:28.517 --> 15:30.379
There must be a way.

15:31.896 --> 15:34.586
- There is a way,

15:34.655 --> 15:36.931
but it's not very American.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.206
- I'll be the judge of that.

of your CHU one day

15:50.275 --> 15:52.344
headed for the showers.

15:52.413 --> 15:54.896
I said, "Hey,
towel's not regulation.

15:54.965 --> 15:57.137
I'm gonna need you to drop it."

15:57.206 --> 15:59.137
You naturally were
swept off your feet,

and had your way with me.

where I'm less of a slut?

16:05.137 --> 16:08.344
- [laughs]
We'll work on it.

16:08.413 --> 16:10.137
- Can we please be serious

16:10.206 --> 16:13.068
about this
Green Card interview?

- Okay.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.344
- Why?
Is that a deal breaker?

16:26.068 --> 16:29.275

- Okay.

16:29.344 --> 16:32.172
- How'd you ask me
to marry you?

16:32.241 --> 16:34.275

the wrong questions.

16:34.344 --> 16:36.103
This shit doesn't say anything
about intimacy.

family losing their home.

that could help him.

hiding something from you.

give a shit.

gave me odds on Sasquatch.

for the man

36:13.275 --> 36:15.482

on that bet.

to my earlier answer of no.

36:34.517 --> 36:38.965
Well, since you're
asking so nicely,

no alternative

your late inning switcheroo.

36:45.827 --> 36:48.000

- What condition?

all the hashish mine,

36:54.724 --> 36:56.068

want a good amount

of yourselves.

that I don't?

very lucky today.

- Well, I hope so.

37:13.310 --> 37:15.413
For your sakes.

back at my base.

that needs attention,

37:24.965 --> 37:26.482

I'm surprised you came.

37:29.103 --> 37:31.551

37:31.620 --> 37:33.586
You helped me find
a way to do that.

37:33.655 --> 37:35.620
But this is just the beginning.

our expectations under control.

- No.

37:46.689 --> 37:48.620

figure out a water situation.

37:48.689 --> 37:50.275

no generator here.

Fine.

to lose by just being here.
