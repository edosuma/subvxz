00:00.968 --> 00:05.237
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:08.774
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:10.576
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.578 --> 00:12.311
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:16.448
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:18.317
<i> And so I hide my powers</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:23.022
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:26.492
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.494 --> 00:29.995
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.997 --> 00:31.997
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.999 --> 00:34.533
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:37.703
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.839 --> 00:41.440
Kara: <i> Previously</i>
<i> on</i> Supergirl...

00:41.442 --> 00:43.842
Alex: <i> All these weapons,</i>
<i> they're nothing</i>
<i> compared to you.</i>

00:43.844 --> 00:46.545
I can't keep using my powers.
It's too much of a risk.

00:46.547 --> 00:50.516
The more time I spend
as Hank henshaw, the less
i have to face what I've lost.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.819
-Um.
-I'm in love with you.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.621
I don't want things to change.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.491
Who's a. Foster, Ms. Grant?

00:59.493 --> 01:02.561
Adam foster is my son.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.164
Not being there for Adam
is my greatest regret.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.138
Kara: <i> We all make mistakes,</i>
<i> have regrets from our past,</i>

01:13.140 --> 01:16.175
<i> things we wish</i>
<i> we could go back and change...</i>

01:16.177 --> 01:19.945
<i> In my case, my biggest regret</i>
<i> is not being there for you.</i>

01:19.947 --> 01:22.448
<i> I know that my choices</i>
<i> may have hurt you</i>

01:22.450 --> 01:25.217
<i> in ways</i>
<i> I can never understand...</i>

01:26.387 --> 01:28.754
<i> But, if you're willing,</i>

01:28.756 --> 01:31.156
<i> I'd like to try and make</i>
<i> things right between us.</i>

01:32.193 --> 01:33.892
<i> It won't be easy.</i>

01:33.894 --> 01:35.928
<i> Nothing worthwhile ever is.</i>

01:36.430 --> 01:37.696
(Woman screaming)

01:40.034 --> 01:41.667
-(Indistinct chattering)
-(Struggling)

01:49.276 --> 01:51.043
(Metallic creaking)

01:51.045 --> 01:55.280
<i> But life is short. And when</i>
<i> all is said and done,</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:59.284
<i> there is nothing more</i>
<i> important than family.</i>

01:59.286 --> 02:02.121
<i> All my love, mom.</i>

02:05.192 --> 02:09.061
-So where'd you put them?
-By a very nice lake
with no fire.

02:09.063 --> 02:11.730
All right, well what happened
to your post-rescue swagger?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.599
Is winn still not
talking to you?

02:13.601 --> 02:17.703
I wish he'd never kissed me.
I wish I had never
hurt his feelings.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.238
I miss my best friend, Alex.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.175
-Just give him space.
And time.
-I hate space and time.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.714
Hi. Is Ms. Grant's
latte ready?

02:29.416 --> 02:30.549
I'm sorry.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.151
Excuse me?

02:32.153 --> 02:34.353
I said, I'm sorry. That you
have to work for cat Grant.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.121
I hear she's a piece of work.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.857
A reputation
she proudly fosters.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.993
Is she really as horrible
as everyone says?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.694
You know, breathes fire.
Eats babies.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.197
Ms. Grant is tough,
but she's amazing.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.499
Not only at her job,
but as a person.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.502
She's pretty badass.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.304
Does she pay you
to say all that?

02:52.306 --> 02:54.139
No.

02:54.141 --> 02:55.774
Well, maybe one day
you'll meet her
and form your own opinion,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.476
instead of listening
to rumors.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.011
Well, she's very
lucky to have you.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.313
(Chuckles)

03:03.784 --> 03:05.350
I think that latte's ready.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.819
-Oh.
-You better run.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.289
Thank you.

03:12.126 --> 03:15.060
Please tell me
you realized that guy
was flirting with you.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.795
(Chuckles) No.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.497
I would not
call that flirting.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.865
He was...
He was friendly.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.833
Oh. You're hopeless.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.304
Female newscaster:
<i> National city police</i>
<i> is anticipating huge crowds</i>

03:25.306 --> 03:29.575
<i> for senator Miranda crane's</i>
<i> anti-alien rally</i>
<i> this afternoon...</i>

03:29.577 --> 03:31.376
Deo duty calls.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.644
(Sighs)

03:37.618 --> 03:39.718
-Winn. Hey...
-(Softly) Hey.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.222
Where you heading?
Are you going down?

03:43.224 --> 03:44.957
Just don't. Please.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.792
Have a nice day.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.400
(Indistinct chattering)

03:55.402 --> 03:56.768
(Clears throat)

03:57.905 --> 04:00.205
Miranda crane is in town.

04:00.207 --> 04:04.109
She is a lightning rod for
bigots, hippies and aliens,

04:04.111 --> 04:08.146
and yes, that is the order
in which I detest them.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.817
Our top reporter has made
the mistake of dumping catco

04:11.819 --> 04:14.219
for a cash grab
at <i> vanity fair.</i>

04:14.221 --> 04:17.356
His ruin will be swift
and merciless, thanks to Lucy,

04:17.358 --> 04:20.492
who will serve him
a lawsuit by the end of today.

04:20.494 --> 04:25.097
-That's not how it works...
-By the end of today.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.066
Meanwhile, we need someone
to get to the rally. Ker-rah,

04:28.068 --> 04:29.901
get me a list of
who's available.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.371
Actually, I'll do it.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.941
-You have layouts
to do. Ker-rah.
-Uh, Ms. Grant...

04:35.943 --> 04:38.010
Nothing that can't
spare an hour.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.779
And with all due respect,
I'm the most experienced
photojournalist you have.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.115
And my connection

04:43.117 --> 04:45.717
to a very famous alien,
i may just be able to

04:45.719 --> 04:47.552
get us a good quote
from senator crane.

04:47.554 --> 04:52.124
You better get us
a quote that will offend
virtually everyone.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.327
That's all.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.631
Ms. Grant...

04:59.633 --> 05:02.234
If you hate bigots more
than aliens, then, why are you
giving senator crane

05:02.236 --> 05:04.636
so much attention?
She's horrible.

05:04.638 --> 05:08.840
(Sighs) Because, ker-rah,
while bigots will always take
the gold on the medal podium

05:08.842 --> 05:12.210
of my contempt, they make
excellent click-bait.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.147
Also, the more they talk,
the more they
sabotage themselves.

05:15.149 --> 05:20.118
It's a magical implosion
happening right before
our very...

05:20.120 --> 05:23.021
-Who is in my office?
-I'll call security.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.726
No. Don't.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.765
Adam?

05:35.369 --> 05:36.435
Hi.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.937
Hi.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.708
Adam: I'm, uh,

05:42.710 --> 05:46.244
sorry to, uh, to show up
while you're working.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.746
(Chuckles) That's...

05:47.748 --> 05:51.149
That's not a problem.
That's not a problem
at all. I...

05:51.885 --> 05:53.318
Are you okay?

05:54.355 --> 05:56.521
But, why? Why? Why today?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.490
(Chuckles) I got your letter.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.393
My letter.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.297
Huh. Of course.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.365
(Chuckles)

06:08.769 --> 06:10.302
(Chuckles nervously)

06:14.208 --> 06:17.943
Well, I am so glad
that you're here.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.213
Thanks for reaching out.

06:21.215 --> 06:24.082
Oh. There's just
so much to say.

06:24.084 --> 06:27.986
But I have a million things
that I have to do right now.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.022
Yeah, I figured. Um,

06:31.024 --> 06:34.259
you know, I'm in town
for a few days.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.496
You free for dinner?

06:37.498 --> 06:39.164
I will make myself free.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.001
Thanks.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.507
Have your cheerleader
e-mail me.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.844
Ker-rah!

06:55.783 --> 06:57.783
What have you done?

06:57.785 --> 07:01.653
Well, you've been writing
a lot of letters, but then
throwing them away.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.822
And last week you threw one,

07:03.824 --> 07:09.094
I won't say at my head,
but in my general direction.
And I read it,

07:09.096 --> 07:10.996
saw it was for Adam,
and maybe...

07:12.800 --> 07:14.866
I finished it for you.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.134
(Gasping)

07:16.136 --> 07:17.969
-(Breathes deeply)
-I know.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.506
I know this is really bad.
I didn't think
he would just show up.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.810
Who told you to think?
You wrote to my son.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.344
Now, get out. You're fired.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.580
I was just trying to help you.
You know my mom died.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.583
I don't get to have
a second chance with her.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.552
I don't want that to happen
to you and Adam.

07:33.554 --> 07:37.355
You crossed a line, ker-rah.
You don't know him.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.958
I don't even know him.
I haven't seen him since
he was a baby,

07:39.960 --> 07:43.295
since his father whisked him
across the country.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.030
-I told you...
-You told me

07:45.032 --> 07:49.034
that losing Adam was the
biggest regret of your life.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.936
Ms. Grant, I've known
you for a while now,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.904
and I don't think you
were ever going
to send that letter.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.941
And another year of you
missing him would
have gone by like that.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.910
I'm sorry.

08:01.181 --> 08:05.450
Sometimes it's easier to face
the past with a little help.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.589
(Sighs)

08:10.591 --> 08:13.592
What kind of sentimental crap
did you write to him?

08:14.962 --> 08:19.631
Oh. Well, this isn't
actually awful.

08:22.803 --> 08:26.972
He did come. He's here.

08:29.343 --> 08:32.611
(Sighs) Oh, my god, he's here.

08:32.613 --> 08:36.815
So, uh, should I make
a dinner reservation,
or am I fired?

08:36.817 --> 08:39.117
Uh... um.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.187
Make a reservation.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.091
And ker-rah?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.793
I'm going to make
your life hell.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.396
It's worth it.
Family always is.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.101
(Crowd cheering)

09:01.775 --> 09:04.943
Crane: <i> Thank you.</i>
<i> Thank you all for coming.</i>

09:05.846 --> 09:07.112
-(Camera clicking)
<i> -Aliens.</i>

09:07.114 --> 09:09.281
<i> Extraterrestrials. Non-humans.</i>

09:09.283 --> 09:11.650
<i> Whether they're wearing</i>
<i> a red cape or not,</i>

09:11.652 --> 09:16.354
<i> they are a threat to this</i>
<i> country, our freedom,</i>
<i> and our lives.</i>

09:16.356 --> 09:17.455
(Device beeping)

09:17.457 --> 09:19.824
<i> Starting today,</i>
<i> we need solutions.</i>

09:19.826 --> 09:21.393
The perimeter is clear.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.360
Try it again.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.829
<i> We need to know</i>
<i> where they live,</i>

09:24.831 --> 09:28.800
<i> what they do and who they eat.</i>

09:28.802 --> 09:34.606
<i> Most importantly,</i>
<i> we need to stop them</i>
<i> from landing in our country.</i>

09:34.608 --> 09:37.576
<i> If it takes a dome,</i>
<i> let's build a dome.</i>

09:37.578 --> 09:41.379
<i> It's time to stop talking</i>
<i> and start acting.</i>

09:41.381 --> 09:44.249
<i> Monsters are coming</i>
<i> for your families.</i>

09:48.722 --> 09:49.988
(Crowd screaming)

09:51.191 --> 09:52.958
(Crowd clamoring)

09:59.366 --> 10:01.967
-Move, move, move!
-Everybody get down!

10:01.969 --> 10:03.301
Man: (Shouting) Move!

10:05.539 --> 10:06.605
(Signal buzzing)

10:07.941 --> 10:09.207
(Signal beeping)

10:14.715 --> 10:15.981
(Growls)

10:17.618 --> 10:18.683
(Gasping)

10:19.686 --> 10:20.752
(Growls)

10:23.490 --> 10:24.656
(Aliens screaming)

10:24.658 --> 10:25.790
Hank...

10:25.792 --> 10:27.058
(Growling)

10:31.064 --> 10:32.330
It's Supergirl.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.768
(Grunts)

10:36.770 --> 10:38.336
(Crane groaning)

10:38.338 --> 10:39.971
-Careful.
-Ah.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.741
-Where did it go?
-I don't know.
It was just here.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.809
Alex on comms: <i> Supergirl,</i>
<i> do you have a visual?</i>

10:44.811 --> 10:46.678
-Is it down there?
<i> -No.</i>

10:46.680 --> 10:48.446
-Whatever it is, it's gone.
-(Panting)

10:54.321 --> 10:55.720
(Sirens wailing)

11:00.293 --> 11:03.528
Transport senator crane to
headquarters, right now.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.164
-What was that thing?
-A creature that doesn't
leave any survivors.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.066
We have to move her now,
before it comes back.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.801
-What did it do to you?
-Nothing. I'm fine.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.703
You're not. You froze.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.405
Did you hear me say
we have to get her back to
headquarters or not?

11:13.407 --> 11:15.774
-Hank.
-It's of the
utmost importance...

11:15.776 --> 11:17.242
Hank!

11:18.045 --> 11:19.644
What the hell happened to you?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.247
I'll tell you what happened.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.115
You people screwed up royally.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.684
And I will not be kept here.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.552
Madam senator, I assure you
it's for your protection.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.454
I know your friend Sam Lane
talks a lot of crap

11:29.456 --> 11:31.423
about the deo,
but we're here to help.

11:31.425 --> 11:34.025
The general told me that
for all your big talk about
monitoring aliens,

11:34.027 --> 11:36.061
you're the first one
to let them in through
the front door.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.863
(Chuckles) I guess
you forgot the part where
i saved your ass.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.833
Mmm. For all I know,
you all staged
that little stunt.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.768
It's just like an alien.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.437
Excuse me?

11:45.439 --> 11:49.307
You're all the same.
Disgusting insects who've
come crawling from

11:49.309 --> 11:54.245
your own diseased, backwater
planets, looking to suck our
resources for yourselves.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.148
-Ow!
-Sedative. You're welcome.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.084
My team and I are currently
tracking your attacker.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.552
We'll keep you updated.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.287
I told you,
I'm not staying here.

12:02.289 --> 12:06.224
Madam senator,
as long as it's out there,
you're in here.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.393
Enjoy your stay at the deo.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.397
Supergirl:
I should've let it eat her.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.666
It would've. It still might.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.302
You ready to tell us
the whole story?

12:17.304 --> 12:19.337
We're looking
for a white martian.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.441
That thing is like you?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.043
(Growling)
It's nothing like me.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.277
That creature and its kind

12:26.279 --> 12:28.947
slaughtered the
green martians.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.783
The white martians
came from beneath
the planet's surface,

12:32.853 --> 12:34.552
bringing fire from
the planet's guts.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.389
And they burned us all.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.792
-Oh, god, j'onn. I'm sorry.
-Don't.

12:40.794 --> 12:45.130
Knowing what we're up
against might just save lives.

12:45.132 --> 12:50.335
This creature belongs to
a race devoted to the mission
of killing me and mine.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.237
It'll be back.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.773
But...
But it attacked the senator...

12:54.775 --> 12:56.674
Make no mistake.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.244
I brought it to national city.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.581
As martians, we not only share
our ability to shapeshift,

13:03.583 --> 13:06.618
we share a link. If I assume
my true form, or phase,

13:06.620 --> 13:09.521
or reach out to it
with my mind, it knows.

13:09.523 --> 13:13.925
It sensed me
when I used my powers to
investigate Maxwell lord.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.294
It attacked the rally
to draw me out.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.364
Then I scared it off.

13:19.366 --> 13:23.034
Thankfully. Because
i couldn't fight it today.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.403
I couldn't even move.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.872
You will next time.
And you're not alone.

13:27.874 --> 13:32.076
We'll find it.
In the meantime,
we'll keep senator crane here.

13:32.078 --> 13:32.777
It's the safest place around.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.550
I have to ask
something of you.

13:38.552 --> 13:41.853
I should be the one
to face this thing.
But if I reveal myself

13:41.855 --> 13:44.289
it'll mean the end of my life
as Hank henshaw.

13:44.291 --> 13:48.560
And if Hank goes,
general Lane gets the deo.
And you know what that means.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.929
You've had my back
a million times.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.498
I've got this one.
I'll bring it in.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.240
Your stem cell facial is
confirmed with Philip,

14:02.242 --> 14:03.875
he'll be at your house
at 7:00 A.M.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.477
Gentle reminder,
he does have
multiple face tattoos,

14:06.479 --> 14:10.982
-so don't call 911 this time.
-Anything else?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.918
Your car's out front to
take you to dinner with Adam.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.954
(Exhales)

14:15.956 --> 14:17.188
How are you feeling?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.991
I know it's been a while since
you've spent...

14:19.993 --> 14:21.426
Oh, ker-rah, shut up.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.195
I have had one-on-one

14:24.197 --> 14:29.267
exclusive sit downs with
the most influential and
powerful people in the world.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.704
Yes, but this isn't
an interview.
This is your son.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.072
And sometimes
you can be a little...

14:36.877 --> 14:40.511
It's just, uh,
when you talk to him,

14:40.513 --> 14:42.814
I think what you say should
come from the heart.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.583
If I had the chance
to talk to my mother,

14:45.585 --> 14:49.821
I'd want her to ask me if...
If I'm happy.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.589
(Kara chuckles)

14:51.591 --> 14:54.759
Even more, I'd want her to
tell me why she made
the decisions she made.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.161
You know, if she could
go back and
do it all over again,

14:57.163 --> 14:58.796
what would she do differently.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.967
Just most of all,
I'd want her to be honest.

15:02.969 --> 15:06.437
I've handled putin,
pope Francis and Taylor swift.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.574
This is Adam. I think
I'll take it from here.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.747
I'll never forget,
i was at a party
with Bill Gates,

15:15.749 --> 15:21.586
and I said to him, I said,
"bill, people want to read the
news on thin little screens

15:21.588 --> 15:23.955
"they can hold in the palm
of their hand," and well,

15:23.957 --> 15:25.790
of course, he blew it.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.861
And now, lord technologies has
made how many thousands of
millions of them?

15:30.196 --> 15:31.829
Wow.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.564
What else did you invent, cat?

15:36.603 --> 15:40.305
Okay, I get it.
Enough about me.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.207
I want to know more about you.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.475
What do you want to know?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.144
How's Cornell going?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.680
-Did you finish
your masters yet...
-I dropped out.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.116
Wow. Well, you know, um...

15:52.118 --> 15:56.988
Some of the nation's greatest
minds never finished college.

15:56.990 --> 16:01.092
I remember my first year,
sitting in endless lectures,

16:01.094 --> 16:03.328
thinking I would
learn more doing.

16:03.330 --> 16:07.432
So, I did. I went and
i got my first internship
at the <i> daily planet...</i>

16:07.434 --> 16:10.835
Did you come to dinner
just so you could
talk about yourself?

16:11.972 --> 16:13.738
Of course not.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.440
Did you even
write that letter?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.076
Yes.

16:20.313 --> 16:24.582
I thought, after reading
what you wrote, that you
wanted things to be different.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.651
You're not even trying.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.519
What do you want me to say?

16:32.625 --> 16:34.559
I guess I came to hear you
say you're sorry.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.960
I am sorry.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.331
I'm sorry.
I wanted to be there.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.401
But you have to understand
that I wouldn't have been
a good mom.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.837
-I wasn't ready.
-I get it.

16:45.839 --> 16:49.240
It's about you. It's always
been about you.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.545
Thanks for dinner, cat.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.885
James, these pictures
are amazing.

17:00.887 --> 17:05.289
Well, thank you.
Near-death experiences do
make me shutter-happy, so...

17:05.291 --> 17:06.557
(Chuckles)

17:07.227 --> 17:08.726
Do you see anything?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.763
No. Nothing out of
the ordinary.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.732
I mean, other than
a white monster from Mars.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.000
(Cell phone ringing)

17:18.138 --> 17:21.639
Oh, if you need to go home,
it's okay.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.709
No, I told Lucy
i was gonna be late, so...

17:27.247 --> 17:28.546
Um...

17:31.518 --> 17:33.051
Take a look at this.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.589
What is that, a flare?
Or a glare?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.591
James: I thought so too,
until...

17:40.593 --> 17:42.026
Look at that.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.195
Did her eyes glow
like that in every picture?

17:44.197 --> 17:46.864
No. Just the ones
after you saved her.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.301
(Sighs)

17:50.303 --> 17:55.139
Thank you. It's been
a long day. And something
tells me it's far from over.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.382
Crane: Any word
on the monster?

18:04.384 --> 18:07.185
Supergirl has graciously
agreed to bring your
attacker in personally,

18:07.187 --> 18:10.188
at great risk to herself,
i might add.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.623
When she captures it,
you'll be safe to go.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.692
And what makes you think
I'll be safe here?

18:15.862 --> 18:17.628
What are you getting at,
senator?

18:17.630 --> 18:21.499
Nothing except whispers
in Washington that say
you need to clean house.

18:21.501 --> 18:25.336
They say Supergirl's not
the only alien inside the deo.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.171
You've got a mole, henshaw.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.411
Madam, I trust
you won't be insulted
if I called you paranoid.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.979
God knows
i wouldn't be the first.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.949
Some aliens can
look like anyone.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.686
Well, we may not have much
in common, but I think it's
safe to say neither one of us

18:41.688 --> 18:44.489
enjoys the idea
of an alien spy
working within your walls.

18:44.491 --> 18:48.493
And if it became public,
well, that would certainly be
very embarrassing for you.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.695
Why do I sense you
have a proposal?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.833
Conduct a very quiet
internal investigation.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.503
I'm sure finding an alien is
within your abilities.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.907
Madam, trust me.

19:02.909 --> 19:07.111
Your time would be better
spent focusing on the American
people rather than these

19:07.113 --> 19:08.513
comic book delusions.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.949
Fine. Play dumb.
Let a mole run wild in here,

19:11.951 --> 19:14.752
just like you let
a white martian run wild
on the street.

19:14.754 --> 19:18.422
But when you're brought down
from the inside,
you remember this.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.524
You were warned.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.027
Kara. Did you find anything?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.228
<i> Pretty sure</i>
<i> the white martian</i>

19:24.230 --> 19:26.097
shapeshifted into
senator crane.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.899
Which means the real
senator might still be in
danger somewhere.

19:27.901 --> 19:28.966
Good to know.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.368
I'm on my way.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.336
Hurry.

19:35.575 --> 19:39.377
It's in your best interest to
find this alien interloper
as quickly as possible.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.612
Your entire operation's
been compromised.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.853
There are no
hidden aliens here.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.590
Are you absolutely
sure of that,
director henshaw?

19:58.364 --> 20:01.299
I wish I could say yes.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.801
I never said you were attacked
by a white martian.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.640
Well, you're smarter
than I thought.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.309
(Grunts)

20:12.478 --> 20:13.544
Ah!

20:16.049 --> 20:17.315
(Alarm blaring)

20:19.919 --> 20:21.185
(Gunfire)

20:32.765 --> 20:33.831
(Growling)

20:35.001 --> 20:36.267
(Yelling)

20:39.639 --> 20:40.705
(Growling)

20:42.775 --> 20:43.841
Spread out!

21:01.661 --> 21:02.727
(Screaming)

21:09.869 --> 21:11.135
(Grunts)

21:24.817 --> 21:25.883
(Growls)

21:29.822 --> 21:31.055
Kara.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.356
I'm going after it.
You stay here.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.225
(Panting) Hank needs you.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.731
Alex, it's fled. Again.

21:40.733 --> 21:43.601
Alex on comms:
<i> I'll work on a plan with Hank.</i>
<i> Keep your eyes open.</i>

21:44.737 --> 21:45.836
(Phone buzzing)

21:45.838 --> 21:47.204
Ms. Grant, everything okay?

21:47.206 --> 21:49.106
No, I need you in
the office...

21:49.108 --> 21:50.508
<i> Now.</i>

21:53.012 --> 21:54.278
(Alarm buzzing)

21:54.847 --> 21:57.948
Hank. J'onn.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.250
I should have known...

21:59.252 --> 22:00.951
(Sighs) This isn't your fault.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.687
-(Sighs)
-If I hadn't pushed you
to use your powers,

22:02.689 --> 22:05.356
none of this would
have happened.

22:05.358 --> 22:09.427
But it did. And now members
of my team are dead
because of me.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.797
This is my war, not earth's.

22:12.799 --> 22:13.931
Not anymore.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.735
You're not alone in this.

22:17.737 --> 22:22.506
I am so sorry for what
happened to your planet.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.876
I can't imagine
what that feels like.

22:25.878 --> 22:29.480
But together,
we're gonna protect this one.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.551
It wasn't just my planet...

22:38.124 --> 22:41.192
J'onn j'onzz: <i> We fought back.</i>
<i> We'd known war.</i>

22:41.194 --> 22:43.461
<i> But not like this.</i>

22:43.463 --> 22:45.196
<i> White martians had been</i>
<i> toiling underground,</i>

22:45.198 --> 22:47.298
building weapons of death.

22:49.635 --> 22:50.735
Fire traps.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.236
Their technology
overwhelmed us.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.372
There was no honor
in how they fought.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.242
They herded us into camps.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.778
(Green martians groaning)

23:00.780 --> 23:04.315
<i> I swore no matter what,</i>
<i> I would protect my family.</i>

23:05.518 --> 23:06.984
We would survive.

23:08.488 --> 23:11.889
But when we got
through the gates,

23:18.498 --> 23:19.764
they took the women
and children.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.532
(Children crying)

23:21.534 --> 23:23.401
<i> Men were forced into labor.</i>

23:23.803 --> 23:24.902
No!

23:24.904 --> 23:27.538
<i> The others went to</i>
<i> the furnace.</i>

23:30.109 --> 23:34.478
(Sighs) My wife and daughters

23:37.316 --> 23:38.616
burned.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.760
I escaped.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.030
I survived.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.866
To my great shame.

23:58.004 --> 24:01.105
I will hear my family's
screams until the day I die.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.373
(Inhales sharply)

24:09.849 --> 24:11.315
Look at me.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.650
(Sighs heavily)

24:12.652 --> 24:15.820
-J'onn, look at me.
-(Shuddering)

24:17.390 --> 24:19.857
There's no shame in surviving.

24:21.828 --> 24:25.963
If your family
would have lived,

24:28.267 --> 24:30.301
you wouldn't want them
to be ashamed.

24:30.303 --> 24:35.406
But they didn't. And now
I've let another one of their
butchers kill again.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.477
I have to stop it.

24:51.224 --> 24:53.257
Yes, Ms. Grant.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.326
Did you not hear me
the first 10 times?

24:55.328 --> 24:57.895
I asked you to bring me
a chamomile.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.630
I'm sorry.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.899
If you're not gonna
be here to handle
my calls, ker-rah,

25:01.901 --> 25:04.268
then I suggest you just
keep walking and throw
yourself off the balcony.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.438
How did dinner with Adam go?

25:07.440 --> 25:10.307
Oh, and then there's that.

25:11.777 --> 25:14.178
Why didn't you prep me?

25:14.180 --> 25:19.116
You took it upon yourself to
lure him in with your
sunny danvers sentimentality,

25:19.118 --> 25:21.652
and then you just let me
go there unprepared.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.324
He's never gonna
talk to me again.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.827
I'm sorry it didn't go well.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.596
He didn't come here to see me.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.465
He came here because
of the letter.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.536
He might as
well have come to see you.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.306
I'm gonna fix this. I promise.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.875
(Clicks tongue) Kara.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.479
(Elevator bell dings)

25:48.481 --> 25:50.915
-Adam! Hi.
-Hello. What are
you doing here?

25:50.917 --> 25:54.051
Uh, it's about your mom.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.621
Wait, are you here to drop off
the apology check?

25:57.623 --> 25:59.356
Yeah, yeah.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.125
This is the part
where my mother usually throws
money at the problem.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.861
I... Ms. Grant didn't
send me. I came

26:03.863 --> 26:06.230
because I have never seen your
mother like this before.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.765
-Like what?
-Scared.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.767
-Of not getting
enough retweets?
-No...

26:09.769 --> 26:11.135
No, of losing you again.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.170
Hey, she did just fine
for 25 years.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.340
Or, she was really
good at pretending.

26:16.342 --> 26:22.379
I know you think your mom
is this heartless,
narcissistic monster...

26:22.381 --> 26:25.015
-Your words...
-Some days, I do too.

26:25.017 --> 26:31.455
But when you get past that,
there's this inspiring person
in there.

26:32.525 --> 26:33.657
A hero.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.593
You talk about her
like she's Supergirl.

26:36.762 --> 26:42.800
(Chuckles softly)
Well, in some ways, she is.

26:42.802 --> 26:47.037
And sometimes being
a hero means
making sacrifices.

26:47.039 --> 26:51.408
Deep down, she always
knew there was something
big she needed to do.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.677
And if she could go back
and do it all over again,

26:53.679 --> 26:58.382
I don't think she would
change a single thing.
Except leaving you.

27:01.554 --> 27:03.153
No, you wrote the letter.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.888
(Chuckles nervously)

27:04.890 --> 27:06.523
What?

27:08.427 --> 27:13.230
No, no! That would
be illegal, maybe,

27:13.232 --> 27:16.767
and completely insane, and...

27:20.206 --> 27:25.175
Yeah, yeah, that was
a thing I did.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.510
I knew it.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.012
This explains everything.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.813
-Only because
she's too scared!
-Of what?

27:29.815 --> 27:30.948
This.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.284
I know letting her in is not
gonna be easy...

27:34.286 --> 27:35.853
(Inhales deeply)

27:35.855 --> 27:37.988
But you have to give
her another chance.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.527
Has anyone ever told you
you deserve a raise?

27:44.196 --> 27:45.596
Is that a yes?

27:45.598 --> 27:46.997
Only if you come with me.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.271
(Clears throat)

27:54.273 --> 27:57.541
Well, I know you both have
a lot you really wanna say
to each other...

27:57.543 --> 27:59.710
I've been informed that
I've already said too much.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.345
And which you mean by that,

28:01.347 --> 28:04.615
despite the tone that
we agreed you wouldn't use,

28:04.617 --> 28:07.885
is that you may not have
expressed yourself
very well at dinner.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.987
No, she expressed
herself perfectly.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.590
Over, and over, and over...

28:13.592 --> 28:18.595
And what you mean by that,
is that you wish she had
focused more on you

28:18.597 --> 28:20.898
because of
all the years spent apart.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.737
Just say something
to each other.

28:26.739 --> 28:29.740
Say something real.
Even if it terrifies you.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.076
Just try.

28:35.781 --> 28:40.384
I never got to put
a picture that you'd drawn
on the fridge.

28:41.721 --> 28:47.324
I never got to
tell you stories.

28:47.326 --> 28:52.796
And I never got to teach you
how not to be afraid
of the world.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.669
And I never got to
tell you how

29:00.005 --> 29:03.407
amazing I think you are.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.976
I never got to be your mom.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.748
But I am your biggest fan,
Adam.

29:12.551 --> 29:16.120
And I'm so, so sad
that I didn't get to see
you grow up.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.823
You didn't want me.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.492
Oh, Adam. That is so not fair.

29:21.494 --> 29:22.826
No, let him talk.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.434
(Shuddering)

29:32.938 --> 29:34.438
Did you miss me?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.106
Of course I missed you.

29:37.710 --> 29:40.511
I missed you every second.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.580
I still miss you.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.416
(Mumbles)

29:46.418 --> 29:51.088
Oh, no, I didn't mean to...

29:56.562 --> 29:57.828
(Adam exhales)

30:02.568 --> 30:04.101
I missed you, too.

30:06.872 --> 30:10.474
(Clears throat)
I'll see you tomorrow,
Ms. Grant.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.010
Thank you.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.918
I'm sorry.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.921
-Um, but?
-No buts.

30:25.457 --> 30:26.890
I'm just sorry.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.632
Can you track it
using its tissue?

30:35.634 --> 30:39.102
If it's in its own skin, yes.

30:39.104 --> 30:42.439
Okay. So what do we do now?

30:44.443 --> 30:46.710
We don't do anything.

30:46.712 --> 30:50.047
No. No, no, no.
That's not happening.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.515
We're gonna bring
this in together.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.983
We're not bringing it in.

30:52.985 --> 30:56.286
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.155
I'm going to find its lair.

30:58.157 --> 31:00.524
And when I do, I will drop
this human coat I wear.

31:00.526 --> 31:06.230
I won't freeze.
I will break its body in half
and bury it in the dry sand.

31:07.433 --> 31:08.732
You're not a murderer.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.234
You don't know me.

31:10.236 --> 31:14.204
I am 317 years old. I can
wear any face I choose.

31:14.206 --> 31:18.709
I speak languages your
mouth can't even form.
You know nothing about me.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.410
-What about the real
senator crane?
-She's dead.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.112
-You don't know that.
-(Sighs)

31:22.114 --> 31:24.948
You said it yourself,
"we don't choose
who we protect."

31:24.950 --> 31:27.584
-So if she's alive,
we have to find her.
-(Sighs)

31:29.421 --> 31:31.755
I know you believe in honor.

31:31.757 --> 31:34.391
There is no honor in what
you're about to do.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.959
It no longer matters.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.081
Agent 1: Floors
one through six are clear.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.750
Alex: She's gotta be
in here somewhere.

31:59.752 --> 32:02.352
Hank, you all right?

32:02.354 --> 32:06.323
I'm in a sewer, danvers,
everything is just peachy.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.358
Alex over comms:
<i> Let me know if</i>
<i> you find something.</i>

32:08.360 --> 32:09.760
No if.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.830
Crane: <i> Help. Help me.</i>

32:13.832 --> 32:14.898
<i> Someone.</i>

32:16.068 --> 32:17.234
(Water dripping)

32:20.973 --> 32:24.107
I know you're there.
Come for me.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.413
Crane: <i> Help. Help me.</i>
<i> I'm in here.</i>

32:29.415 --> 32:30.681
Go, go.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.217
(Breathes heavily)

32:34.219 --> 32:35.552
Senator crane?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.587
(Weakly) Thank you. Thank god.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.022
(Sighs) Hank,
i have the senator.

32:41.694 --> 32:43.660
That's impossible.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.729
(Breathing shakily)
Please.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.164
She's with me.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.099
Hank: <i> Alex.</i>

32:49.101 --> 32:50.334
Get back.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.635
-(Growls)
-(Screaming)

32:52.471 --> 32:53.770
(Roars)

32:54.440 --> 32:55.706
(Screeches)

33:03.782 --> 33:04.848
(Gasps)

33:08.020 --> 33:10.354
Would you like to know why
i haven't killed you?

33:10.823 --> 33:12.723
I'm bait.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.925
You could save yourself pain
by telling me which
of your coworkers

33:14.927 --> 33:16.393
is the martian.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.896
(Breathing heavily)
Go to hell. I'm not talking.

33:19.898 --> 33:22.766
The thing you're protecting,
it's the last remnant

33:22.768 --> 33:25.535
of an infestation
my people eradicated.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.437
It's an insect.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.905
But you? (Chuckles)

33:30.209 --> 33:31.842
You're not even an insect.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.245
You're what worms eat.

33:35.247 --> 33:38.181
And half of you will do
just as well as bait.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.317
J'onn j'onzz:
<i> You want me, not her.</i>

33:40.319 --> 33:43.720
<i> You may not have</i>
<i> a soul, but we share</i>
<i> a telepathic bond.</i>

33:43.722 --> 33:46.390
<i> I've been loath to use it,</i>
<i> but you left me no choice.</i>

33:46.392 --> 33:48.058
You want your human pet back?

33:48.060 --> 33:52.863
I want this to end.
Prove to me my agent
is alive, and I'll come.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.434
Your friend wants to know
if you're still breathing.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.036
Beg him to save you.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.138
J'onn, don't.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.339
Is she there?

34:02.341 --> 34:04.875
I can hear her. She's alive.

34:04.877 --> 34:08.145
-This ends tonight.
-Crane: <i> The desert.</i>

34:08.147 --> 34:12.082
It reminds me of home.
Come now so
i can water the ground

34:12.084 --> 34:13.583
with your blood, j'onn j'onzz.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.452
Or you can let
another child die.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.956
She's in the desert.
You get Alex and get out.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.858
I'm not leaving you alone
with that thing.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.393
You have to. I'm done.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.663
Done? Done with what?
It has Alex.
We've got to stop it.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.432
This started because
it wanted me dead.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.834
My race gone. If I'm all
that's left, let it have me.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.170
No, this murderer
does not get to win.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.938
And you don't get to give up.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.106
It will save Alex.

34:36.108 --> 34:37.841
We don't choose.

34:38.777 --> 34:39.810
We fight.

34:39.812 --> 34:42.112
Kara, I'm tired of
being the last.

34:42.114 --> 34:46.316
Tired of having lived.
You, of all people, know how
heavy it is to survive.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.285
I do.

34:48.287 --> 34:52.456
I ask myself every day
why my mother didn't crawl
into that pod with me.

34:53.258 --> 34:56.193
Now I know she felt guilty.

34:56.195 --> 34:59.930
She felt responsible for
what happened on Krypton.

34:59.932 --> 35:01.431
Dying must have seemed

35:02.935 --> 35:04.601
honorable.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.670
But dying is a lot easier

35:06.672 --> 35:08.872
than getting back up
when the world's ended.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.008
You have to get up.

35:12.978 --> 35:14.478
You have to go on.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.013
My road is done.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.586
I'll help Alex
and then join my people.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.622
Wherever they are.

35:28.827 --> 35:29.893
(Sighs)

35:41.406 --> 35:42.772
(Whooshing)

35:44.309 --> 35:45.609
Is this what you wanted?

35:46.879 --> 35:47.944
Run.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.848
(Speaking alien language)

36:24.082 --> 36:25.415
(Grunts)

36:34.026 --> 36:35.091
(Grunts)

36:59.985 --> 37:01.051
(Panting)

37:04.456 --> 37:05.922
It's over, j'onn.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.290
(Breathing heavily)

37:07.292 --> 37:08.592
It's all right.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.027
-(Grunts)
-(Gasps)

37:11.029 --> 37:12.395
(Kara breathing heavily)

37:12.397 --> 37:13.730
What are you doing?

37:15.133 --> 37:19.102
I'm sorry.
But I can't let you stop me.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.170
(Groaning)

37:25.944 --> 37:27.010
J'onn.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.213
J'onn, j'onn, listen to me.

37:30.215 --> 37:32.249
I lost everything.

37:32.251 --> 37:33.717
(Voice breaking) Everyone.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.654
It makes a hole in your heart.

37:37.656 --> 37:41.925
But you can't fall into it.
You have to fill it.
You have to fight.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.629
(Groaning)

37:46.531 --> 37:49.699
Do not throw away who you are.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.302
If you do, that thing wins.

37:52.304 --> 37:56.473
The last son of Mars dies,
even if you're still standing.

37:57.342 --> 37:58.608
(Shuddering)

38:01.013 --> 38:02.712
(White martian growling)

38:02.714 --> 38:05.315
My kind will come for me
and you will die!

38:05.317 --> 38:08.652
They will
come and you will
all know destruction.

38:08.654 --> 38:09.986
There are more of you?

38:09.988 --> 38:13.523
Thousands. Millions.

38:14.559 --> 38:15.959
(White martian growling)

38:16.495 --> 38:18.194
Let them come.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.230
(White martian growling)

38:27.072 --> 38:28.538
You did the right thing.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.073
I'm sorry you had to.

38:34.980 --> 38:39.683
My daughters were named
k'hym and Tanya.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.153
It's not the same, but...

38:44.389 --> 38:47.257
Any man would be proud
to call you his daughters.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.059
(Sniffles)

38:53.498 --> 38:55.131
Enough of that.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.232
Right. Right.

38:56.234 --> 38:58.101
Sorry. (Clears throat) Boss.

39:15.821 --> 39:17.087
Awfully quiet today.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.824
Space and time.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.464
<i> I know many of my supporters</i>

39:27.466 --> 39:32.869
<i> are surprised to hear that</i>
<i> I'm revising my stance</i>
<i> on the anti-alien initiative.</i>

39:32.871 --> 39:34.971
<i> While it's important</i>
<i> we remain cautious,</i>

39:34.973 --> 39:37.807
<i> we still have a lot</i>
<i> to learn before</i>
<i> we take action.</i>

39:37.809 --> 39:42.212
Reporter: Senator,
this decision is in light
of an alien at your rally.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.080
What changed?

39:44.082 --> 39:47.550
<i> Supergirl.</i>

39:47.551 --> 39:51.019
<i> She apprehended my</i>
<i> attacker and saving who</i>
<i> knows how many lives.</i>

39:51.022 --> 39:54.591
<i> Her efforts to protect me</i>
<i> and national city</i>

39:54.593 --> 39:59.429
<i> taught me that not all</i>
<i> visitors to our world</i>
<i> are the enemy.</i>

39:59.431 --> 40:04.434
<i> And as a nation, we cannot</i>
<i> let fear dictate our future.</i>

40:04.436 --> 40:05.702
Ker-rah, get me the senator,

40:05.704 --> 40:08.104
I wanna do an interview
for our lead story.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.907
Ah.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.210
I thought you
were flying home.

40:14.212 --> 40:18.114
Nah, change of plans.
I wanted to stick around
a little longer.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.083
(Chuckles) Well, great.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.485
Maybe, we can do lunch.
If you want to.

40:22.487 --> 40:23.787
Yeah, lunch sounds good...

40:25.457 --> 40:28.057
Hey, have you
seen Kara around,
by any chance?

40:28.059 --> 40:29.759
Uh, no.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.763
She's probably
in the bathroom picking
muffin out of her hair. Why?

40:33.765 --> 40:35.298
Well, she does have nice hair.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.201
I see.

40:38.203 --> 40:42.572
-(Panting) Here's your latte,
Ms. Grant. Hi, Adam.
-Hey.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.141
-(Kara sighs)
-(Clears throat)

40:45.610 --> 40:46.876
Hmm.

40:47.946 --> 40:52.015
Ker-rah. If you need me,
i will be in my office.

40:54.920 --> 40:59.255
-Hey, so, I'm confused.
Is it ker-rah or Kara?
-(Chuckles)

40:59.257 --> 41:00.690
It's ker-rah to your mom.

41:00.692 --> 41:05.228
And Kara to literally
everyone else on
the planet. And beyond.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.096
Gotcha. Um...

41:08.233 --> 41:10.233
Kara, I wanted to say
thank you.

41:10.235 --> 41:14.070
For all of this.
Um, I'm really glad
i came to see my mom.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.674
And I'm really glad I met you.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.942
Oh...

41:20.712 --> 41:22.679
What are your thoughts about
Korean barbecue?

41:22.681 --> 41:26.316
Uh, I don't think your mom
would be into
grilling her own meat.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.650
Not for her, for you.

41:28.453 --> 41:29.719
Oh.

41:30.322 --> 41:31.421
Oh.

41:31.423 --> 41:33.690
Oh, you're asking me out.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.426
How about tomorrow night?

41:36.428 --> 41:41.264
Well, uh, I'd have to check in
and make sure I could.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.866
She's available.

41:43.802 --> 41:47.303
I am... I'm available.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.738
I'll see you then.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.440
(Chuckles)

41:51.743 --> 41:53.009
(Softly) Bye.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.582
-The hot guy from noonan's?
-Yup.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.417
(Chuckles softly) Called it.

42:01.419 --> 42:03.152
I don't know if I can do this.

42:03.154 --> 42:06.689
I haven't been on
a real date in like forever.

42:06.691 --> 42:11.361
(Sighs) You incinerate robots
and you prevent buildings
from collapsing.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.763
You can handle a date.

42:13.765 --> 42:16.032
Even if he's cat Grant's son?

42:16.568 --> 42:17.901
You're kidding.

42:17.903 --> 42:20.103
Nope. Switch.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.170
(Scoffs)

42:23.642 --> 42:28.244
So... so what happens
at the office when
the date goes bad?

42:28.246 --> 42:32.315
Kara. Please just
go on the date first
and have fun

42:32.317 --> 42:34.517
before you talk about
it going bad.

42:34.519 --> 42:38.054
If cat's upset, you know,
that's her problem.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.924
Ooh, her problems
are my problems.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.692
-You need boundaries.
-I can't help it.

42:42.694 --> 42:44.427
When someone needs help,
I'll help them.

42:44.429 --> 42:47.530
I get that. As Supergirl.

42:47.532 --> 42:52.335
But Kara, you don't
need to save
everyone all the time.

42:52.337 --> 42:54.938
Female newscaster:
<i> We interrupt this program</i>
<i> for breaking news.</i>

42:54.940 --> 42:58.341
<i> Supergirl has arrived</i>
<i> at the scene of the</i>
<i> accident on route 1.</i>

42:59.277 --> 43:00.843
How are you there?

43:01.313 --> 43:02.445
I'm not.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.520
Yeah. That is
definitely not me.
