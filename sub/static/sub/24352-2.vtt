I heard a rumor
that Penn and Teller

02:57.270 --> 02:59.630
have another
psychic animal trick

02:59.630 --> 03:01.570
in their warehouse,

03:01.570 --> 03:03.030
one that they've never performed,

03:03.030 --> 03:05.330
and I don't even think
they remember.

03:05.330 --> 03:07.370
I asked
a close, personal friend

03:07.370 --> 03:10.900
of Penn and Teller
to sneak in and steal it.

03:10.900 --> 03:13.330
I mean, how cool would it be
to fool Penn and Teller

03:13.330 --> 03:14.670
with their own trick?

03:14.670 --> 03:17.370
[laughter]
So he agreed.

03:17.370 --> 03:19.830
He got it, and, uh,
he's willing

03:19.830 --> 03:22.700
to talk me through the trick
via video conference

03:22.700 --> 03:25.130
just as long
as I hide his identity.

03:25.130 --> 03:27.000
So, if we can
try and connect

randomly into the audience?

04:44.330 --> 04:47.130

a volunteer.

04:47.130 --> 04:49.570

Uh, we have a raccoon.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.430
Uh, we have a penguin.

06:13.870 --> 06:17.000

06:18.800 --> 06:20.200

06:20.200 --> 06:22.000

06:22.000 --> 06:23.600
- The, uh, tiger.
<i>- Yes.</i>

06:23.600 --> 06:26.130

<i>- Yes, excellent.</i>

06:26.130 --> 06:29.430
<i>Okay, now have your friend...</i>
- That's you, Mark.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.500

- So, close your eyes...

06:31.500 --> 06:32.670
<i>- Reach into the box...</i>

06:32.670 --> 06:33.870
- And I need you to
reach into the box...

06:33.870 --> 06:35.370

the stuffed animal.</i>

06:51.500 --> 06:53.230
<i>That's not--
How's that--</i>

06:53.230 --> 06:54.770
- No, no it isn't the parrot.
<i>- Yeah, you had a--</i>

06:54.770 --> 06:57.230
- I think they did it.
<i>- You had a box of parrots!</i>

06:57.230 --> 06:59.830
- It--it is a box of parrots.
<i>- A box of parrots.</i>

06:59.830 --> 07:03.200
How could you possibly
screw this one up?

07:03.200 --> 07:04.630
<i>- No, no--
[laughter]</i>

07:04.630 --> 07:07.770
- There's no way!
There's no way!

07:07.770 --> 07:10.270
<i>How could you be that stupid--</i>
- No, I got it--

07:10.270 --> 07:12.030
I think I--Gilbert.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.370
The--the
prediction is concealed

07:14.370 --> 07:15.770
inside the envelope.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.970
It said inside,
not by the envelope.

07:37.570 --> 07:41.070
[happy exclamation]
- Thank you. Thank you.

07:41.730 --> 07:44.230
- So, does it feel different
to have clothes on?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.100
- So much different.
- Yeah?

07:46.100 --> 07:47.670
- [laughing] Yes.
- You like it?

07:47.670 --> 07:49.170
- Um, I think that that
this is gonna work for me.

07:49.170 --> 07:50.170
- I think it works.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.230
- I think this will be
my new thing.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.730
- So the first time
you fooled them,

07:52.730 --> 07:54.970
you didn't realize
you fooled them.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.970
- No, no I--I didn't.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.930
Being naked
and onstage, up here,

07:58.930 --> 08:00.530
it's a--
first of all, this whole thing

08:00.530 --> 08:02.400
becomes a blur, but

08:02.400 --> 08:04.330
when Penn started talking
to me,

08:04.330 --> 08:07.100
I had really no idea
what he was talking about,

08:07.100 --> 08:10.030
and I just assumed that--
that it was--

08:10.030 --> 08:12.130
he was telling me how--
how the trick was done.

08:12.130 --> 08:14.730
So when he said,
"You fooled us,"

08:14.730 --> 08:17.630
it was as genuine of a response
as you can get.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.230
- Yeah.
So is there a lot

08:19.230 --> 08:21.330
riding on whether or not
you're fooling them?

08:21.330 --> 08:23.200
'Cause you already have
one trophy.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.700
- Certainly fooling them
would be great,

08:24.700 --> 08:27.030
but, man, I didn't think
I could do it the first time.

08:27.030 --> 08:29.070
And I--
this is probably

08:29.070 --> 08:31.500
a longer shot
than the first one.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.630
- All right.

08:32.630 --> 08:34.130
Well, let's see
if Penn and Teller

08:34.130 --> 08:36.270
can expose your trick.
- Okay.

08:36.270 --> 08:39.200
- So first of all,
can we examine that box?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.100
- Uh, yeah, there--
there are a lot of

08:41.100 --> 08:42.600
tricky boxes in Las Vegas.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.300
- No, we can't examine the box.
- This is not one of them.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.330
- You're not gonna let us
examine the box.

08:46.330 --> 08:47.330
- Oop.

08:51.970 --> 08:55.270
- Okay. Okay.
[laughter]

08:55.270 --> 08:57.870
That was not part
of what we were busting you on.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.670
No, no,
we had the other part.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.370
We think that when Gilbert
was holding up

09:02.370 --> 09:04.670
that piece of paper--
which is amazing,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.270
Gilbert's barely a monkey.
[laughter]

09:06.270 --> 09:08.370
Getting him to even hold up
a piece of paper

09:08.370 --> 09:09.570
is remarkable.

09:09.570 --> 09:10.830
He can't do anything.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.630
He certainly can't fool us.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.430
He held up a piece of paper
that was

09:14.430 --> 09:16.530
blue screen, green screen,
chroma key,

09:16.530 --> 09:19.270
and you had one
of your little minions--

09:19.270 --> 09:21.100
out in the booth,
out in the truck--

09:21.100 --> 09:23.630
that laid in the name Mark,
didn't you?

09:23.630 --> 09:24.930
- Um...

09:24.930 --> 09:27.070
- He was holding up
a blue card.

09:27.070 --> 09:28.770
- Was it a visual effect?
- No. No.

09:28.770 --> 09:29.970
- It wasn't exactly
how you described it.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.030
- See, this is the, uh...
- Ohh.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.370
- Problem you have here.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.930
If there's one thing we hate,
it's being fooled.

09:34.930 --> 09:37.700
If there's two things we hate,
it's being fooled twice

09:37.700 --> 09:39.100
by the same guy.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.630
If there's three things
we hate,

09:40.630 --> 09:43.870
it's being fooled
by Gilbert Gottfried.

09:43.870 --> 09:44.970
[laughter]

09:44.970 --> 09:46.600
Now I'm telling you
right now, Vinny,

09:46.600 --> 09:50.470
we will not be fooled
by Gilbert Gottfried.

09:50.470 --> 09:51.970
[laughter]
What I'm trying to say to you,

09:51.970 --> 09:54.100
Vinny, you idiot,
is you fooled us.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.330
- Whoa!
[cheering and applause]

09:56.330 --> 09:58.670
- That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

09:58.670 --> 10:00.000
But I want you to swear--

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Wait.
Stop! Stop!

10:03.000 --> 10:04.970
Stop, don't give that to him.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.230
I want your word of honor...
- Yes.

10:07.230 --> 10:09.470
- Gilbert Gottfried,
that piece of [bleep],

10:09.470 --> 10:11.730
did not fool us, okay?
- Yes.

10:11.730 --> 10:13.700
- He did not fool us;
Vinny did.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.500
But not Gilbert.
[laughter]

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
Not Gilbert, Vinny.
- Vinny Grosso

10:18.500 --> 10:22.870
fooled Penn and Teller
a second time!

10:22.870 --> 10:25.430
Congratulations.

10:25.430 --> 10:27.230
[happy sigh]

10:27.230 --> 10:28.600
Not Gilbert.
- Not Gilbert.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.500
- No. We--
- Not Gilbert.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.400
- We've got a fooler
in the house.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.330
- But not Gilbert.
- Not Gilbert.

10:34.330 --> 10:35.600
- We'll see--
- Not Gilbert.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.970
- We'll see
if we can find another...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.570
- It wasn't Gilbert Gottfried!
- When we come back.

10:38.570 --> 10:40.270
- Gilbert Gottfried
will not fool me!

10:40.270 --> 10:41.930
Never! Never!

<i>[jazz music]</i>

10:47.130 --> 10:49.700
<i>[jazz music]</i>

10:49.700 --> 10:52.470
[cheering and applause]

10:52.470 --> 10:54.330
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

10:54.330 --> 10:56.670
The British are coming.
The British are coming.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.400
Really.
Take a look.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.000
- Hello, I am Rhys Morgan.
- I am Robert West.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.700
And we are...

11:04.700 --> 11:06.970
[together]
Time-travelling magicians.

11:06.970 --> 11:09.570
- And we fooled Penn and Teller
back in the very first season

11:09.570 --> 11:10.970
of this show.
- Ooh.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.470
Why don't we travel
back in time

11:12.470 --> 11:14.030
to show everybody?
- Ooh.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.370
[together]
Here we go.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.470
[device beeps]
[pop]

11:17.470 --> 11:19.800
- Like every other magician
on the show...

11:19.800 --> 11:22.870
- We awaited their decision
with bated breath.

11:22.870 --> 11:25.570
[both chattering indistinctly]

11:25.570 --> 11:27.400
- There we are.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.270
- What do you mean?
- That's empty. This is empty.

11:29.270 --> 11:33.600
- It's empty.
- There was no deck switch.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.670
- You fooled us.
- Yeah!

11:35.670 --> 11:36.700
[cheers and applause]

11:36.700 --> 11:37.870
- Well played, old chap.

11:37.870 --> 11:39.770
- Thank you.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.330
<i>- When we fooled
Penn and Teller,</i>

11:42.330 --> 11:43.700
<i>we weren't really
expecting it.</i>

11:43.700 --> 11:45.330
It helped enormously.
- Helped us leave our jobs.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.130
- It helped us leave our jobs,
and it helped us sort of

11:47.130 --> 11:48.330
just get going, really.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.470
- Will we fool
Penn and Teller again?

11:50.470 --> 11:52.730
- Well, we are time travelers,
so we do know.

11:52.730 --> 11:54.700
- Well, yes, we know,
but they do not.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.500
- Oh, good point.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.100
Let's find out.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.270
<i>[mysterious music]</i>

12:00.270 --> 12:03.070
[cheers and applause]

12:03.070 --> 12:07.800
- From across the pond,
here are Morgan and West.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.600
[cheering and applause]

12:09.600 --> 12:11.270
- Hello, good evening.

12:11.270 --> 12:12.730
Good evening, everybody.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.630
My name is Rhys Morgan.
- And I'm Robert West.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.400
[together] Together, we are
Morgan and West.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.030
- Magicians.
- Time travelers.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.870
- And all-around spiffing chaps.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.900
- And for our trick
this evening,

12:22.900 --> 12:24.800
we need someone
with some change

12:24.800 --> 12:26.070
in their pocket.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.770
- Or their wallet.
- Or their purse.

12:27.770 --> 12:29.330
- Or their money belt.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.700
- In fact, a handful of change,

12:31.700 --> 12:34.270
a mere coin or two
will not suffice.

12:34.270 --> 12:35.770
- Yes, indeed.
But not only some change,

12:35.770 --> 12:38.100
but a driver's license,
such that,

12:38.100 --> 12:40.100
well, we can tell
who you are, frankly.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.670
- So if anyone does have
a handful of change

12:41.670 --> 12:44.600
and a driver's license,
please just raise your hand.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.330
Gentleman here, with a beard.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.430
When you come to the stage,
close the change in your hand

12:48.430 --> 12:50.130
so there's no way
Mr. Morgan can see it.

12:50.130 --> 12:51.330
And make your way
to the stage.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.500
A round of applause
for this gentleman here.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.070
Big round of applause here.
[applause]

12:54.070 --> 12:55.630
- As is soon
to become apparent,

12:55.630 --> 12:57.370
I cannot look behind me

12:57.370 --> 12:58.870
or see what is going on
on the table behind me

12:58.870 --> 13:00.570
for any of the remainder
of this trick.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.230
Uh, the easiest way
to keep me honest

13:02.230 --> 13:04.030
is to have someone to do that.
- Hold the tray, here...

13:04.030 --> 13:05.830
- Thankfully, we have
the wonderful Alyson Hannigan.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.000
A big round of applause,
if you would.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.500
Alyson, would you join me
just here?

13:08.500 --> 13:09.770
- Yes.
- Please, madam.

13:09.770 --> 13:10.900
- Yes.
- Delighted to meet you.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.200
How do you do?
- Good.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.670
- Alyson,
for the next few minutes

13:13.670 --> 13:15.670
I'm going to stare
directly into your eyes,

13:15.670 --> 13:17.330
and you are going to stare
directly into mine.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.430
- Yes.
- It could be said

13:18.430 --> 13:20.200
that I'll have eyes
only for you.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.630
- Aww.
- Now, should I attempt

13:21.630 --> 13:22.870
to turn around,
look behind me,

13:22.870 --> 13:24.700
or to the side
in any way, shape, or form,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.930
the signal to alert everyone
is very simple

13:26.930 --> 13:29.200
and straightforward.
[clears throat]

13:29.200 --> 13:30.400
Hark!
Foul play!

13:30.400 --> 13:32.500
[laughter]
- [laughing] Okay.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.600
- Obviously, now, you are happy
that I cannot see behind me.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
I'm not looking.
- Yes.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.870
- Wonderful.

13:36.870 --> 13:40.970
- Now if you'd wait there
for a moment for me, Carl.

13:40.970 --> 13:43.530
Try this yourself.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.400
Close your eyes,

13:45.400 --> 13:48.170
and see what you can make out.

13:48.170 --> 13:50.500
We promise not to run off,
when you have your eyes shut.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.130
- Okay, Alyson, obviously,
do not close your eyes.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.430
- All right.
- Yes, thank you.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.030
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.030 --> 13:58.100
- Now, hand me a coin, Carl.
- [chuckles]

13:58.100 --> 14:00.370
- Happy?
- Yeah.

14:00.370 --> 14:03.170
Close your eyes,
have a go.

14:03.170 --> 14:05.430
[coin clinking]
- Quite a sharp note.

14:05.430 --> 14:08.400
Uh, that, quite simply put,
is a penny.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.370
- Ooh.
- Carl?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.600
Is that a penny?
- It is a penny.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.630
- Excellent.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.400
[applause]

14:23.330 --> 14:26.330
Take another.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.630
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.270
- Oh, uh...

14:37.270 --> 14:39.330
Two coins, but I think
both the same, actually.

14:39.330 --> 14:42.770
Uh, both of these are, uh,
ten cent pieces.

14:42.770 --> 14:45.230
What do you call that, dimes?
Two dimes.

14:45.230 --> 14:47.770
- Carl,
what are those two coins?

14:47.770 --> 14:49.030
- Two dimes.
- Wonderful.

14:49.030 --> 14:51.600
- Two dimes.
[applause]

14:53.370 --> 14:55.270
- Of course, uh,
at this point,

14:55.270 --> 14:57.130
it could just be blind luck.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.930
I mean, we are in Vegas,
after all.

14:58.930 --> 15:02.470
Uh, though I think you'll agree
that the next bit is

15:02.470 --> 15:04.070
a shade more impressive.

15:27.430 --> 15:30.500
- Carl, will you cup
your hands together, like so?

15:32.170 --> 15:35.170
$2.42...

15:36.200 --> 15:38.670
Exactly.

15:38.670 --> 15:39.670
Carl, confirm for the audience,

15:39.670 --> 15:41.730
there's 25 cents...
- Yep.

15:41.730 --> 15:44.230
- That's 50 cents...
- Yes.

15:44.230 --> 15:46.130
- 75 cents...
- Yes.

15:46.130 --> 15:47.900
- One dollar...
- Right.

15:47.900 --> 15:50.270
- $1.25...
- Yes.

15:50.270 --> 15:52.470
- $1.50...
- Yes.

15:52.470 --> 15:54.530
- $1.75...
- Yes.

15:54.530 --> 15:55.970
- $1.80...
- Yes.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.630
- $1.85...
- Yes.

15:57.630 --> 16:00.100
- $1...

16:00.100 --> 16:02.970
90, right?
- Yes, yes.

16:02.970 --> 16:06.700
- $1.95...
- Yep.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.770
- $2, yes?
- Yes.

16:08.770 --> 16:10.400
- $2.10...
- Right.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.930
- $2.20...
- Yes.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.270
- $2.30...
- Yes.

16:14.270 --> 16:17.670
- $2.31... 32... 33...

16:17.670 --> 16:21.030
34... 35... 36...

16:21.030 --> 16:25.830
37... 38... 39...

16:25.830 --> 16:28.300
$2.40...

16:28.300 --> 16:31.430
$2.41...

16:33.770 --> 16:35.970
[scattered laughter]

16:35.970 --> 16:40.100
- $2.42 exactly.
[applause]

16:40.100 --> 16:43.800
You can put them away, Carl.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.500
Okey dokey, one more question.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.700
This really is your ID.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.770
- It really is my ID.
- Perfect.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.830
Now, Alyson, I would like you
to come up to Mr. Morgan

16:53.830 --> 16:55.030
and check there's nothing
inside his ears

16:55.030 --> 16:56.070
feeding him information.

16:56.070 --> 16:57.300
No tiny devices,

16:57.300 --> 16:58.870
no speakers, nothing
lodged in his ear canal

16:58.870 --> 17:01.170
relaying information to him.
- No.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.500
- Could you also confirm for us
there are no hidden mirrors

17:03.500 --> 17:04.900
or screens that
Mr. Morgan can see

17:04.900 --> 17:06.500
that they cannot, that
is allowing him to see

17:06.500 --> 17:08.470
what is going on behind him?
- No.

17:08.470 --> 17:10.730
Then, when you're ready,
listen closely.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.930
As I'm sure we'll all agree,

17:12.930 --> 17:15.700
this next bit
is completely impossible.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.530
- Uh, that is
a driver's license

17:22.530 --> 17:24.930
from the state of, uh,

17:24.930 --> 17:26.599
the state of Nebraska.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.500
- What state is this
driver's license from, Carl?

17:28.500 --> 17:29.900
- Nebraska.
- Nebraska?

17:29.900 --> 17:30.900
- Yeah.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
[scattered applause]

17:31.900 --> 17:33.630
[laughs]

17:38.570 --> 17:39.930
- Uh, according
to your driver's license,

17:39.930 --> 17:44.500
as written, uh,
your height is 5'10".

17:44.500 --> 17:45.630
- Is that your height?
5'10"?

17:45.630 --> 17:48.770
- [sighs]
It is.

17:48.770 --> 17:50.770
[scattered applause]
[laughs]

17:50.770 --> 17:52.300
[laughter]

17:56.230 --> 17:57.670
- Uh, it's...
Oh.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.900
Um, date of birth.
Yes, date of birth is, um--

18:00.900 --> 18:02.930
uh--oh gosh--uh--

18:02.930 --> 18:05.870
Was that September the, uh--
the September.

18:05.870 --> 18:07.370
- Yes, it was September?
- September.

18:07.370 --> 18:10.030
- The 25th...
Both: Yes.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.400
- 1979.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.770
- Is that your date of birth,
Carl?

18:12.770 --> 18:14.030
- [laughing] Yes.

18:14.030 --> 18:15.400
- A round of applause for Carl.
[applause]

18:15.400 --> 18:17.030
- And for Alyson,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.470
[all chattering]
- Thank you.

18:19.470 --> 18:22.030
Morgan and West!

18:22.030 --> 18:24.870
Hi. I'm gonna go over with you.
both: Please do.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.900
- That was really,
really amazing.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.000
- Oh, thank you.
- We're quite fond of it.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.600
- Especially 'cause I'm sure

18:29.600 --> 18:32.230
you're more accustomed
to, like, pounds.

18:32.230 --> 18:33.730
- Yes, I'll be honest...
- Pences.

18:33.730 --> 18:34.900
- Pences.
- It's been a whirlwind.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.300
- It's been a--
it's been a whirlwind.

18:36.300 --> 18:39.070
- Yes, uh, American coinage is
very different to UK coinage.

18:39.070 --> 18:40.570
- You have to re-learn
all the sounds, yes.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.400
- Yeah. Well, and you guys
have so many more coins.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.470
- Ab--absolutely.
- We do, yeah.

18:44.470 --> 18:45.830
- Yeah, a few more.
- Yes.

18:45.830 --> 18:47.530
So you're time travelers?
- Obviously.

18:47.530 --> 18:49.430
[laughter]
- Yes, so I guess

18:49.430 --> 18:51.470
you could tell us
if you fooled them or not.

18:51.470 --> 18:52.700
- We would,
but that would spoil it--

18:52.700 --> 18:53.930
th--that's the whole point
of them being--

18:53.930 --> 18:55.600
the only bit they get to do
is telling us

18:55.600 --> 18:57.170
whether we fooled them or not,
so why spoil it?

18:57.170 --> 18:58.400
both: Why spoil it?
- All right.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.030
Well, so let's--
let's check in with them.

19:00.030 --> 19:02.030
- Shall we?
- Let them tell us.

19:02.030 --> 19:03.130
- Gentlemen.

19:03.130 --> 19:05.300
So good to see you again.
- Pleasure.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.070
- And good to see less of you.
- I know.

19:07.070 --> 19:08.530
- Almost 100 pounds, right?
- Yeah.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.070
You were the inspiration
for that, so thank you.

19:10.070 --> 19:12.430
- Congratulations.
Congratulations, man.

19:12.430 --> 19:14.200
[applause]

19:14.200 --> 19:16.130
You know,
last time you were on,

19:16.130 --> 19:17.630
you fooled us,
you really did.

19:17.630 --> 19:18.730
[together]
We did.

19:18.730 --> 19:20.430
- And you fooled us
mostly because

19:20.430 --> 19:22.530
we underestimated you
a little bit.

19:22.530 --> 19:23.800
- Possibly, yes.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.630
- We're not gonna make
the mistake this time.

19:25.630 --> 19:26.970
- Oh, [indistinct]

19:26.970 --> 19:28.300
- We have a pretty good idea
of how good you are.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.500
Now, we were wondering, uh--

19:30.500 --> 19:32.730
no one in the United States
would recognize this.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.870
You probably know
about Piddington's, don't you?

19:34.870 --> 19:36.330
- Oh, we do, yes.
- Oh, we do.

19:36.330 --> 19:37.770
- [laughing]
You probably do know abou--

19:37.770 --> 19:39.870
it's a--it's a chain of stores,
or something.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.300
- Oh, yes, very good chain.
- Yes, yes, very, very--

19:41.300 --> 19:42.370
- You have to spend
lunch time over there,

19:42.370 --> 19:43.900
but--but you know
all about that.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.870
And since you time travel,
you probably know

19:45.870 --> 19:48.330
that we did an act called
"Mofo the Psychic Gorilla."

19:48.330 --> 19:49.500
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.870
- Which we were not nearly
as good as you are.

19:51.870 --> 19:52.900
- Oh, bless you
for saying that.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.170
- Uh, but you are wicked good.

19:54.170 --> 19:56.570
And you probably also know,
because you time travel,

19:56.570 --> 19:59.200
that, um--
that, uh, digital photography

19:59.200 --> 20:00.370
is very popular now.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.200
There was a time in the past
where they did--

20:02.200 --> 20:04.430
there was Kodak.
You know about Kodak?

20:04.430 --> 20:05.800
- Absolutely, yeah.
- Sure, sure, sure.

20:05.800 --> 20:09.430
Most acts that come on
and do this kind of thing--

20:09.430 --> 20:10.930
first of all,
they're not as good.

20:10.930 --> 20:12.670
And second of all,
the audience

20:12.670 --> 20:14.770
doesn't really understand
what they're doing

20:14.770 --> 20:16.700
because there's
no cause and effect.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.730
The idea of having
the drop in the glass--

20:19.730 --> 20:22.200
although you're not really
supposed to believe it,

20:22.200 --> 20:23.870
part of your heart does.

20:23.870 --> 20:24.970
And that carries you through,

20:24.970 --> 20:26.770
and there's a reason
for doing it.

20:26.770 --> 20:28.000
I love that it's the--

20:28.000 --> 20:30.570
the fact that you're doing it
all with the sound,

20:30.570 --> 20:32.070
and that's just a wonderful act.

20:32.070 --> 20:34.100
And we love you guys.
But I think

20:34.100 --> 20:36.800
we should have given you
enough that maybe--

20:36.800 --> 20:38.070
- Oh, I think we can infer--
- I think we're hearing you.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.900
- I think we're hearing you
and we can infer

20:39.900 --> 20:42.200
meaning in your words beyond
the meaning that other people

20:42.200 --> 20:43.930
would perhaps recognize
in those words.

20:43.930 --> 20:46.570
- [laughing]
- [chuckles]

20:46.570 --> 20:48.030
All right, so I'm guessing

20:48.030 --> 20:49.070
you know what
they're talking about.

20:49.070 --> 20:50.300
- We know what they know.
They know...

20:50.300 --> 20:51.570
[together] What we know.
- Awesome.

20:51.570 --> 20:52.630
- Everything--
we all know what's--

20:52.630 --> 20:54.530
- Well, you were
fabulously entertaining.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.970
I asked the producers

22:50.970 --> 22:52.870
to choose five
totally random people

22:52.870 --> 22:54.130
from the audience to join me.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.630
And I want to thank you
for coming up

22:55.630 --> 22:56.630
and helping me out.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.400
I'm not gonna ask your names,

22:58.400 --> 23:00.770
because your names
are going to determine

23:00.770 --> 23:03.030
the outcome of this trick.

23:03.030 --> 23:05.470
But first, a little story.

23:05.470 --> 23:08.630
In the early '70s,
there was a study done

23:08.630 --> 23:11.230
in Las Vegas
about winners and losers.

23:11.230 --> 23:13.530
They studied people
that won big jackpots,

23:13.530 --> 23:16.230
and people that went home
totally broke.

23:16.230 --> 23:18.770
And there was a fascinating
statistic in this study

23:18.770 --> 23:20.670
that said,
for some strange reason,

23:20.670 --> 23:22.700
all of the winners in the study

23:22.700 --> 23:25.170
had an even number of letters
of letters in their name.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.070
And all of the losers
in the study

23:27.070 --> 23:29.330
had an odd number of letters
in their name.

23:29.330 --> 23:31.130
It became known
in the gambling industry

23:31.130 --> 23:33.470
as "the lucky study."

23:33.470 --> 23:35.670
Now, the question is,
could your names

23:35.670 --> 23:37.270
determine your luck?

23:37.270 --> 23:39.230
Let's find out right now.

23:39.230 --> 23:42.130
I have a pack of cards
right here, 52 ca--

23:42.130 --> 23:43.700
Oh, 54.
I have the jokers in the deck,

23:43.700 --> 23:45.130
but we won't use the jokers.

23:45.130 --> 23:47.000
And I'd like everyone
to do me a favor:

23:47.000 --> 23:48.730
Come forward,
and hold out your hand out

23:48.730 --> 23:50.000
like that, and you're gonna
put your finger

23:50.000 --> 23:51.070
on the back of one card.

23:51.070 --> 23:53.000
So all five, come back--
forward.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.130
Just hold your hand out
like that.

23:54.130 --> 23:55.670
Put your finger on one card.

23:55.670 --> 23:57.700
Okay, perfect.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.430
Now, slide those cards out.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.870
Okay.
Slide 'em out.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.470
Take them back to your seat.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.730
Now, I'm going to have
all of you

24:05.730 --> 24:07.270
look at your cards.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.030
Just like this, okay?
Got it?

24:10.030 --> 24:12.300
Okay. And now,
I'm gonna turn my back.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.070
And when I turn my back,
I'm going to have you

24:14.070 --> 24:16.070
flip the card out to
the audience, just like that.

24:16.070 --> 24:17.370
Okay?
Now, go ahead.

24:17.370 --> 24:18.370
You can turn it out

24:18.370 --> 24:19.970
to the audience, all right?

24:19.970 --> 24:22.300
And look at it.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.730
Now, everyone in the audience,
remember one person

24:24.730 --> 24:27.370
and their card, okay?

24:27.370 --> 24:29.630
Now, flip the card back around
toward yourself.

24:29.630 --> 24:31.830
And we will now be ready to go.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.700
Now, we're going to place
those five cards

24:33.700 --> 24:35.830
back in the deck,
one at a time, all right?

24:35.830 --> 24:37.530
First card, right over here.

24:37.530 --> 24:40.470
Now normally, a magician
has to find one card.

24:40.470 --> 24:43.070
But, well, I have to fool
Penn and Teller,

24:43.070 --> 24:44.400
so I'm gonna do five.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.230
Now, would you place
yours here?

24:46.230 --> 24:47.830
And let's get back
to the story.

24:47.830 --> 24:51.170
Now, has anyone ever heard
of the name Thomas Preston?

24:51.170 --> 24:52.170
Probably not.

24:52.170 --> 24:53.600
Thomas Preston was a gambler

24:53.600 --> 24:54.800
in the early '70s,

24:54.800 --> 24:56.500
but he never really won
much of anything.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.330
He read about the lucky study,

24:58.330 --> 25:01.270
and he decided
to change his name,

25:01.270 --> 25:02.730
because when he added up
the number of letters

25:02.730 --> 25:06.570
in his name, he discovered
he had 13 letters in his name.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.700
A very unlucky number
for a gambler.

25:08.700 --> 25:12.400
So, Thomas Preston
changed his name

25:12.400 --> 25:14.430
to Amarillo Slim.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.600
Oh, this is true.
You can Google it.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.700
And once he changed his name
to Amarillo Slim,

25:20.700 --> 25:22.530
he actually became very lucky,

25:22.530 --> 25:25.400
because "Amarillo Slim"
had 12 letters in the name.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.400
And he went on to win four
World Championships of Poker,

25:29.400 --> 25:32.830
the last one
with a royal straight flush

25:32.830 --> 25:34.100
in spades.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.430
Not something you see normally
in Las Vegas.

25:37.430 --> 25:39.030
Now, the question is:

25:39.030 --> 25:41.630
Did changing his name
change his luck?

25:41.630 --> 25:44.800
We're gonna see right now,
with these five new friends

25:44.800 --> 25:46.000
I have here at the table.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.230
Here's what I want you to do:

25:47.230 --> 25:48.500
I want you to add up
the number of letters

25:48.500 --> 25:50.770
in your first and last name
together, okay?

25:50.770 --> 25:53.030
Now, you can use your fingers
to do this to be sure.

25:53.030 --> 25:54.900
Please, by all means.
[laughter]

25:54.900 --> 25:57.970
Now, I'm going to take--
and start over here,

25:57.970 --> 25:59.270
and I'd like to know
how many letters

25:59.270 --> 26:00.930
in your first and last name
together.

26:00.930 --> 26:02.230
-There's 15.
- 15--

26:02.230 --> 26:04.370
Oh, 15, wow.
[inhales sharply]

26:04.370 --> 26:06.270
We might be down
to first names only here.

26:06.270 --> 26:08.630
[all laughing]
Okay, one, two, three,

26:08.630 --> 26:11.870
four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten,

26:11.870 --> 26:14.070
11, 12, 13, 14.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.700
You said 15?
15.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.700
How many in yours?

26:16.700 --> 26:17.730
- Eight.
- Eight.

26:17.730 --> 26:19.030
And, uh,
that's not your card

26:19.030 --> 26:20.030
by any chance, is it?

26:20.030 --> 26:21.930
Okay, one, two, three, four,

26:21.930 --> 26:23.930
five, six, seven, and eight.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.570
How many in yours?
- 14.

26:25.570 --> 26:27.800
14, uh--first names only.
Go with--

26:27.800 --> 26:29.470
Figure out how many letters
in your first name.

26:29.470 --> 26:31.170
14, that's not your card?
- No.

26:31.170 --> 26:34.730
- Okay, one, two, three,
four, five, six--

26:34.730 --> 26:36.030
You said?
- 14.

26:36.030 --> 26:39.830
- Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.930
How many in your first name?
- 17.

26:41.930 --> 26:43.270
- How many? First name?
- First name?

26:43.270 --> 26:45.270
Uh, 12.
- 12?

26:45.270 --> 26:46.770
- 12.
- First name?

26:46.770 --> 26:48.200
- Yeah.
- Do you have a nickname?

26:48.200 --> 26:50.900
[laughter]

26:50.900 --> 26:52.600
- So, five.
- Five?

26:52.600 --> 26:54.830
Okay.
And is that your card?

26:54.830 --> 26:56.000
- No.
- No, okay.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.230
One, two, three, four,
and five.

26:59.230 --> 27:00.800
And how many in yours?
- 22.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.130
- First name?
- No.

27:02.130 --> 27:03.230
[all laughing]
Five.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.370
- Five.
And that's not your card?

27:04.370 --> 27:05.400
- Nope.
- Okay.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.200
One, two, three, four, five.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.630
Let's see if this worked.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.970
Now, there's no way I
could have controlled anything.

27:11.970 --> 27:14.300
But, I had
five random cards selected,

27:14.300 --> 27:15.930
shown to the audience,
and I dealt

27:15.930 --> 27:17.270
the number of letters
in your name.

27:17.270 --> 27:19.570
I had to use your nickname,
but we got there.

27:19.570 --> 27:21.730
For the very first time,
let's see if you're as lucky

27:21.730 --> 27:23.670
as Amarillo Slim.

27:23.670 --> 27:25.870
What was the name of your card,
do you remember?

27:25.870 --> 27:27.470
- Yes.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.530
It's the four of clubs.

27:29.530 --> 27:31.000
- Four of clubs?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.300
Boom.

27:32.300 --> 27:33.800
All right.
- Oh.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.430
- And your card?
- Seven of spades.

27:36.430 --> 27:37.970
- Seven of spades?

27:37.970 --> 27:39.900
And your card?
- Eight of spades.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.870
- Eight of spades.
And your card?

27:41.870 --> 27:44.300
- Red king.
- A red king of diamonds.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.900
And your card?
- Five of hearts.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.900
- Five of hearts,
just like that.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.770
And I thank you.
Thank you.

27:49.770 --> 27:51.130
[cheering and applause]

27:51.130 --> 27:54.030
Oh, but,
ladies and gentlemen--

27:54.030 --> 27:56.630
ladies and gentlemen,
it's possible Penn and Teller

27:56.630 --> 27:58.770
already know
how that trick was done.

27:58.770 --> 28:03.170
However, I promised, Penn,
to surprise you.

28:03.170 --> 28:05.430
And remember,
I told you Amarillo Slim

28:05.430 --> 28:08.200
won his final
World Championship Poker hand

28:08.200 --> 28:11.570
with something you don't see
too often in Las Vegas.

28:11.570 --> 28:12.930
And if we look
at the bottom card

28:12.930 --> 28:15.270
of each one of these packets,
if we're lucky

28:15.270 --> 28:18.870
we just might find
Amarillo Slim's...

28:18.870 --> 28:23.130
Royal... straight... flush...

28:23.130 --> 28:26.100
in... spades.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.770
[cheering and applause]

28:27.770 --> 28:29.930
Thank you,
thank you very much.

28:29.930 --> 28:31.130
Thank you,
thank you for helping me.

28:31.130 --> 28:33.270
- Paul Gertner!

28:33.270 --> 28:35.300
[cheering and applause]

28:35.300 --> 28:37.600
Hello!
- Thank you, good to see you.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.770
- Good to see you again.
- I'm here.

28:39.770 --> 28:41.730
- Ah, wow,
what have you been doing

28:41.730 --> 28:43.470
since the last time we saw you?

28:43.470 --> 28:44.730
- Well, it's been a lot.

28:44.730 --> 28:46.530
I've been very busy,
and actually as a result

28:46.530 --> 28:47.730
of being on
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

28:47.730 --> 28:49.000
I have my own show now...
- [gasps]

28:49.000 --> 28:51.100
- In Boston,
every Friday night.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.800
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:52.800 --> 28:54.570
- So do you think that--
that you have even more

28:54.570 --> 28:56.530
riding on this--
this fool than--

28:56.530 --> 28:57.730
than in previous times?

28:57.730 --> 28:59.230
- Maybe, maybe.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.270
'Cause I spent about
2 1/2 years on this trick.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.700
- You practice a lot.
I remember.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.730
- I do practice a lot...
- Yes.

29:03.730 --> 29:05.130
- And this one required that.

29:05.130 --> 29:08.400
- So, is there such a thing
as practicing too much?

29:08.400 --> 29:10.770
- Uh, I think, uh,
I think there is, yeah.

29:10.770 --> 29:12.530
Because in--
in terms of hands...

29:12.530 --> 29:14.030
- Oh.
- If you practice too much,

29:14.030 --> 29:15.900
hands cramp up a little bit
because you're doing certain,

29:15.900 --> 29:17.970
weird techniques, and
maneuvers, and so on like that.

29:17.970 --> 29:20.270
- How many times did you
practice this morning?

29:20.270 --> 29:21.800
- Uh--oh, let's see,
to be honest,

29:21.800 --> 29:24.630
I think I did the trick
about 15 times this morning.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.770
- Wow.
- Well, 15, 20.

29:25.770 --> 29:27.400
- Whoo, that's a lot.
- Yeah, yeah.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.400
- [laughing]
- All right.

29:28.400 --> 29:29.970
Penn. Teller.

29:29.970 --> 29:32.130
Uh, hi!
- [laughing]

29:32.130 --> 29:33.270
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

29:33.270 --> 29:35.670
Uh, boy, when
we see Paul Gertner, we worry.

29:35.670 --> 29:37.430
And this is an important one,
it's the tie-breaker.

29:37.430 --> 29:38.470
- That's true.

29:38.470 --> 29:40.170
- You fooled us once...
- Mm-hmm.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.630
- You didn't fool us
the second time...

29:41.630 --> 29:43.270
- No, I didn't.
- Now it's the third time.

29:43.270 --> 29:45.430
- Yep.
- And this is, uh--

29:45.430 --> 29:47.630
Paul plays this game
at a different plane

29:47.630 --> 29:49.700
than everybody else
that comes out here.

29:49.700 --> 29:50.730
- [chuckles]

29:50.730 --> 29:52.100
- 'Cause, uh,
he did a trick that

29:52.100 --> 29:56.670
I am certain fooled
just about everybody watching.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.730
And yet you sat there, smug,
knowing we were seeing

29:59.730 --> 30:03.130
you do every one
of those five moves.

30:03.130 --> 30:04.500
- Okay.
- But you were okay with that.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.030
Because you're a rat bastard.
[all laughing]

30:08.030 --> 30:09.100
That's why you're okay
with that.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.470
And you were saying,
"Well, you know,

30:10.470 --> 30:12.730
let 'em catch me at
the other thing, at the end."

30:12.730 --> 30:13.870
- [laughs]
- Okay?

30:13.870 --> 30:16.870
Now, when you turned
your back on us,

30:16.870 --> 30:20.000
to the audience that seems
like, "Oh, he's being so fair,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and so honest," right?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.600
But you turn your back,
we as magicians think,

30:24.600 --> 30:26.930
"He can do anything
he wants with that deck."

30:26.930 --> 30:30.000
He's there by himself
with his back to us,

30:30.000 --> 30:31.870
with the c--
with the cards in his hand.

30:31.870 --> 30:34.500
And then you said
that you were going to

30:34.500 --> 30:36.670
add on a little trick
at the end.

30:36.670 --> 30:40.130
And we think you did add on,
and we think you added on

30:40.130 --> 30:41.930
something besides just a trick.

30:41.930 --> 30:44.370
You added on something
to accomplish the trick.

30:44.370 --> 30:46.230
Know what we're talking about?

30:46.230 --> 30:49.370
- Did you do something tricky
when your back was turned?

30:49.370 --> 30:52.870
- I didn't do anything tricky
when my back was turned, but...

30:52.870 --> 30:54.900
- You didn't do it like that?

30:54.900 --> 30:56.730
- It's a fooler!

30:56.730 --> 30:58.830
[cheering and applause]

30:58.830 --> 31:00.200
You did it!

31:00.200 --> 31:01.670
[cheers and applause]

31:01.670 --> 31:03.470
- Again.
- Whoo!

31:03.470 --> 31:05.570
- Tie-breaker.
Nicely done.

31:05.570 --> 31:06.970
- Thank you, thank you.

31:06.970 --> 31:09.400
- I love it when you do this.
- [laughs]

31:09.400 --> 31:11.670
Thank you.
Whoa!

31:11.670 --> 31:14.530
Thank you so much.
Hey!

31:14.530 --> 31:16.970
- Paul Gertner!

31:16.970 --> 31:18.130
Whoo!

31:18.130 --> 31:20.000
[cheering and applause]

31:20.000 --> 31:22.570
We have a two-time fooler,
and we still have

31:22.570 --> 31:26.170
more rematches in store
when we come back.

31:26.170 --> 31:28.330
[cheering and applause]

31:28.330 --> 31:31.500
<i>[jazz music]</i>

31:34.100 --> 31:36.570
<i>[jazz music]</i>

31:36.570 --> 31:38.830
[cheering and applause]

31:38.830 --> 31:40.630
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

31:40.630 --> 31:43.130
Two magicians have fooled
Penn and Teller tonight.

31:43.130 --> 31:45.570
Can we turn a pair
into three of a kind?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.270
Let's find out right now.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.270
Take a look:

31:50.030 --> 31:51.370
<i>- I come from
really humble beginnings.</i>

31:51.370 --> 31:53.170
And there's no way
that I would have

31:53.170 --> 31:55.830
ever imagined that
I'd be where I am now.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.270
- Teller's gonna give you
your trophy.

31:57.270 --> 32:00.570
Eric Jones has fooled
Penn and Teller.

32:00.570 --> 32:03.530
<i>- I've been able to work
literally all over the globe.</i>

32:03.530 --> 32:04.600
[ding]

32:04.600 --> 32:05.600
<i>And it's all because</i>

32:05.600 --> 32:07.800
<i>of fooling Penn and Teller.</i>

32:07.800 --> 32:11.500
<i>I travel 200 days a year.</i>

32:11.500 --> 32:14.070
<i>This whole thing
is to make sure</i>

32:14.070 --> 32:17.100
<i>that I'm giving my son
the best life I can.</i>

32:17.100 --> 32:18.700
So that he doesn't have
to struggle

32:18.700 --> 32:20.000
the same way I did.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.370
<i>This time,
if I fool Penn and Teller,</i>

32:22.370 --> 32:25.070
<i>I will be one step closer
to having</i>

32:25.070 --> 32:27.270
<i>a theater that
I can call home.</i>

32:27.270 --> 32:28.770
<i>[gentle electronic music]</i>

32:28.770 --> 32:31.670
[cheers and applause]

32:31.670 --> 32:34.670
- With two randomly selected
audience members,

32:34.670 --> 32:38.200
please welcome
the "always money" Eric Jones.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.400
[applause]

32:39.400 --> 32:41.470
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:41.470 --> 32:42.700
Penn and Teller,
thank you so much

32:42.700 --> 32:44.230
for having me back.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.970
Hey, how are you?
I'm Eric. You are?

32:45.970 --> 32:47.500
- Avery.
- Avery and...

32:47.500 --> 32:49.070
- Irena.
- Irena.

32:49.070 --> 32:51.330
Guys, I want to show you
something really cool

32:51.330 --> 32:54.070
with some really simple props,
and I hope you enjoy it.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.670
The first thing
I want to show you

32:55.670 --> 32:56.830
is a little lighter.

32:56.830 --> 32:58.970
Irena, do you know
how to operate a lighter?

32:58.970 --> 33:01.900
Would you mind
showing the audience?

33:01.900 --> 33:04.070
Give her a round of applause,
nobody's ever done it better.

33:04.070 --> 33:06.270
- [laughs]
[applause]

33:06.270 --> 33:07.630
- The other thing
I want to show you

33:07.630 --> 33:11.430
lives inside of
my Italian men's carry-all.

33:11.430 --> 33:12.800
Tell me,
do you see anything inside?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.270
- Yeah, pieces of paper.

33:14.270 --> 33:15.870
- Pieces of paper, yeah.
- Yes.

33:15.870 --> 33:19.070
- It's hard to count
exactly how many there are.

33:19.070 --> 33:20.370
But I'll uh, dump 'em out.

33:20.370 --> 33:22.430
That way,
you can see everything.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.730
Watch.
Take a look at 'em.

33:23.730 --> 33:26.030
These are what I like to call
"wish paper."

33:26.030 --> 33:27.030
You can examine it.

33:27.030 --> 33:28.630
Anything that you wish for

33:28.630 --> 33:29.670
can become available.

a little bit on the inside

38:46.300 --> 38:48.400
We, uh--
and there's a term of art

38:48.400 --> 38:50.530
used in magic: misdirection.

38:50.530 --> 38:52.500
And that word,
especially recently,

38:52.500 --> 38:54.700
has been used more and more
by laypeople.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.530
People that aren't in
the magic community

38:56.530 --> 38:58.300
use the word "misdirection."

38:58.300 --> 39:01.430
If you read editorials,
or a pundit speaking,

39:01.430 --> 39:03.470
they'll say
"misdirection" a lot.

39:03.470 --> 39:06.470
And the way laypeople use it
is wrong--well, not wrong.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.630

use words wrong.

39:10.230 --> 39:12.830
But less nuanced
than magicians use it.

39:12.830 --> 39:14.630
When laypeople use
the word "misdirection,"

39:14.630 --> 39:17.630
they often mean it as a--
as a synonym for distraction.

39:17.630 --> 39:18.930
Like, "Hey!
Look over there!"

39:18.930 --> 39:20.800

over here.

And then, when you come back,
the--the magic's done,

39:23.130 --> 39:26.900
and the problem with that is,
that doesn't work.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.130
If you know you're distracted
and look away,

39:29.130 --> 39:31.500
when you come back,
you aren't fooled at all.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.400

"misdirection,"

39:34.400 --> 39:35.630

a curating of attention.

Now, we're gonna do this
in a really pure form,

39:57.900 --> 39:59.730
because in a--
in another magic show,

39:59.730 --> 40:02.800
this chicken would have
some cute little name, like...

40:02.800 --> 40:04.600
Cluckie McCluckface,
or something.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.930
[laughter]
But no, just a chicken.

40:06.930 --> 40:09.170
And the chicken coop
would be dressed as, like,

40:09.170 --> 40:11.470
a rocket ship,
or a train, or something,

40:11.470 --> 40:12.800
and there'd be some story.
But no,

40:12.800 --> 40:14.530
we're not talking
about that kind of story.

40:14.530 --> 40:16.700

But once you're thinking, "The
chicken is going to disappear,"

40:20.970 --> 40:22.330

40:22.330 --> 40:24.070
about the story
you're telling yourselves.

40:24.070 --> 40:26.300

what you're concentrating on.

you've decided
