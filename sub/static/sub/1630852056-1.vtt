WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:03.967
You hit her with a bottle

00:04.033 --> 00:05.333
and she suffered a heart attack.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.700
I bopped her with it.

00:06.767 --> 00:09.500
She was trying
to get in line ahead of you?

00:09.567 --> 00:11.734
Yes. Like an entitled Karen.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.900
You can't use a dangerous instrument

00:13.967 --> 00:16.333
against another human being, period.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.133
Grow up.

[narrator] <i>Savannah Bruce is suing</i>
<i>fellow driver Diana Bellefontaine</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:45.767

00:46.800 --> 00:48.533
[Kevin] Court, come to order. All rise.

00:51.066 --> 00:52.433
[Judy] Be seated, please.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.900
Good morning, Judge.

00:53.967 --> 00:56.967
We have case 1083,
Bruce vs. Bellefontaine.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.467
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:58.533 --> 01:01.300
[Judy] Ms. Bruce,
you're a driver for Uber?

01:01.367 --> 01:02.200
Was.

01:02.266 --> 01:04.166
How long were you an Uber driver?

01:04.233 --> 01:05.400
Two years almost.

01:05.467 --> 01:10.000
[Judy] Your complaint states
that you're immunocompromised?

01:10.066 --> 01:11.200
Yeah. I have asthma.

01:11.266 --> 01:12.533
You take medication for it?

01:12.600 --> 01:13.533
I have an inhaler.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.734
-[Judy] And that's it?
-Yeah.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.500
[Judy] This incident
happened on what date?

01:17.567 --> 01:19.400
July 31st, 2020.

01:19.467 --> 01:20.867
[Judy] Briefly and succinctly,

01:20.934 --> 01:23.600
it is your claim that the defendant

01:23.667 --> 01:26.467
filed a false police report against you

01:26.533 --> 01:30.066
which resulted in your losing your job

01:30.133 --> 01:31.800
-as an Uber driver.
-Yes.

01:31.867 --> 01:35.400
[Judy] And you wanna be
compensated to the tune of $10,000?

01:35.467 --> 01:37.967
Yeah. At this point, Your Honor,
I've lost over $10,000...

01:38.033 --> 01:40.266
or over $10,000 in wages.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.867
-[Judy] That's possible.
-[Savannah] And I've been blacklisted.

01:42.934 --> 01:45.300
[Judy] Because you
have an arrest for assault,

01:45.367 --> 01:47.266
-is that what you're saying?
-[Savannah] No.

01:47.333 --> 01:50.934
It's a pending battery charge
that they kicked me out the platform for.

01:51.000 --> 01:51.900
Okay.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.767
Is that action still pending?

01:53.834 --> 01:56.967
It's been dismissed,
but Uber will not take my phone calls.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.133
-[Judy] Just a sec.
-Yes.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.900
I just wanna make certain that
that criminal action has been dismissed.

02:01.967 --> 02:03.600
Otherwise, I would not do this case.

02:03.667 --> 02:04.934
Yes, and I have proof.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.266
[Judy]
I'd like to see the document

02:06.333 --> 02:07.967
that dismisses the criminal trial.

02:08.033 --> 02:09.433
[Savannah] Yes.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.967
And then we'll get to the facts.

02:21.734 --> 02:23.533
Oh, my dear. Okay.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.734
I'll get to this in a second.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.800
Okay. So, this is what happened

02:27.867 --> 02:31.300
and it was on July 31st, 2020.

02:31.367 --> 02:36.033
You and the defendant, who did not know
each other prior to this confrontation,

02:36.100 --> 02:37.633
were both standing in line,

02:37.700 --> 02:39.834
according to what I read,
to have your cars washed.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.567
You were driving for Uber at the time,
and according to you,

02:42.633 --> 02:44.300
had been for a couple of years,

02:44.367 --> 02:47.834
and had been doing that
during the height of the global pandemic,

02:47.900 --> 02:49.533
and you claimed that you felt

02:49.600 --> 02:52.100
specifically threatened in this case

02:52.166 --> 02:54.333
because you were immunocompromised.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.734
I asked what the nature
of that illness was,

02:56.800 --> 02:58.300
and you say you had asthma,

02:58.367 --> 03:00.533
for which you take an inhaler. Okay.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.567
It is your claim that there was a dispute

03:03.633 --> 03:05.867
over the defendant

03:05.934 --> 03:08.967
cutting in front of your car, she says,

03:09.033 --> 03:10.000
"Cutting in front of your car,

03:10.066 --> 03:13.367
pushing in where two lanes merged

03:13.433 --> 03:15.500
to pay to get into the car wash."

03:15.567 --> 03:17.834
You'll explain that to me
in a little more depth.

03:17.900 --> 03:22.333
According to you, the defendant
got out of her car in a violent manner,

03:22.400 --> 03:25.967
came up to your car,
you opened the passenger window...

03:26.033 --> 03:27.867
My passenger side window was already down.

03:27.934 --> 03:30.133
Fine. She came up to the car, you say,

03:30.200 --> 03:33.767
acting erratically,
she was yelling at you, and...

03:33.834 --> 03:36.000
she was yelling at you during COVID,

03:36.066 --> 03:38.767
she was unmasked, you felt threatened.

03:38.834 --> 03:42.734
In order to get her away from the car,
according to you,

03:42.800 --> 03:45.200
you flung at the car window

03:45.266 --> 03:47.300
a Pringles, empty Pringles can.

03:47.367 --> 03:49.567
That's what I believe you say in here,

03:49.633 --> 03:51.700
it was an empty Pringles can.

03:51.767 --> 03:54.000
I may be wrong.
You look as if you want to say something.

03:54.066 --> 03:57.000
-Well, the report came up a little...
-[Judy] Just-Just-Just...

03:57.066 --> 03:58.066
-I'm looking at what you...
-[Savannah] Okay.

03:58.133 --> 03:59.400
...said to me in here.

03:59.467 --> 04:01.066
Okay.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.800
Yes. "I panicked and I grabbed
an empty Pringles container

04:04.867 --> 04:06.767
and threw it towards the window,"
that's what you wrote.

04:06.834 --> 04:08.133
You remember writing that?

04:08.200 --> 04:11.200
They wrote that out a little bit wrong,
I bopped her with it.

04:11.266 --> 04:12.600
But yes, a Pringle can.

04:12.667 --> 04:16.667
"I grabbed an empty Pringles can
and threw it towards the window."

04:16.734 --> 04:19.200
So, what you're saying now,
that is not correct, you...

04:19.266 --> 04:21.767
and you hit her
with the empty Pringles can?

04:21.834 --> 04:23.400
-Yes, Your Honor.
-[Judy] Okay.

04:23.467 --> 04:26.266
And then she got back into her car

04:26.333 --> 04:30.934
and you decided not to go through
the car wash at that time, and you left?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.400
-Yes, I...
-[Judy] So far?

04:32.467 --> 04:34.500
-...never got...
-So far, is that correct?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.567
You did not go through
the car wash and you left?

04:36.633 --> 04:38.400
Yes, and I never got out of my car.

04:38.467 --> 04:39.567
[Judy]
I didn't say you got out of your car.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.200
-Okay.
-I said you...

04:41.266 --> 04:43.600
-[Savannah] Yeah.
-You corrected me and said not to...

04:43.667 --> 04:46.700
you didn't throw
this empty Pringles container at her,

04:46.767 --> 04:48.100
you bopped her with it,

04:48.166 --> 04:49.533
which means you hit her with it,

04:49.600 --> 04:52.033
and then did not wait around
to see what happened.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.667
-You left?
-I left.

04:53.734 --> 04:56.333
[Judy]
Subsequently, you discovered

04:56.400 --> 04:59.834
that she had, in fact,
reported this incident to the police,

04:59.900 --> 05:03.934
she alleged that she
was in fact assaulted by you

05:04.000 --> 05:05.600
with an instrument,

05:05.667 --> 05:10.433
and you were in fact arrested,
and you hired a lawyer?

05:10.500 --> 05:12.333
Were you assigned a public defender?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.633
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:13.700 --> 05:16.400
And the public defender,
according to this,

05:17.600 --> 05:19.900
had conferences
with the district attorney.

05:19.967 --> 05:24.400
And the district attorney
applied for a dismissal of this case

05:24.467 --> 05:26.233
in the interest of justice.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.533
Do you know what that means?

05:27.600 --> 05:28.667
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:28.734 --> 05:32.200
Well, for those people
who may be watching this,

05:32.266 --> 05:34.033
those millions of people,

05:34.100 --> 05:35.233
Lord willing,

05:35.300 --> 05:36.600
-who are watching this program...
-[audience laughs]

05:36.667 --> 05:40.233
...interest of justice,
so say the court, in this case,

05:40.300 --> 05:44.800
in the <i>People of the State of California</i>
<i>v. Savannah Marie Bruce,</i>

05:44.867 --> 05:49.600
"after reviewing the evidence in this
case, including the victim statements,

05:49.667 --> 05:53.266
defendant statements,
and independent witness statements,

05:53.333 --> 05:56.033
the People conclude that the defendant

05:56.100 --> 05:59.367
committed a battery upon the victim."

05:59.433 --> 06:01.800
That's the way the court starts.

06:01.867 --> 06:05.333
"When the defendant struck the victim

06:05.400 --> 06:08.200
with a metal water bottle,

06:08.734 --> 06:12.166
the defendant had other less violent means

06:12.233 --> 06:15.100
to stop any threat that she felt."

06:15.734 --> 06:17.834
That's the conclusion of the court.

06:17.900 --> 06:22.133
"However, the People
also conclude that the defendant

06:22.200 --> 06:25.333
could have felt threatened

06:25.400 --> 06:30.266
by the victim's aggressive approach
to the defendant's car.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.800
Therefore,
the defendant would likely receive,

06:33.867 --> 06:38.033
if the case went to trial,
a self-defense instruction.

06:38.100 --> 06:42.834
Therefore,
she has a colorable self-defense,

06:42.900 --> 06:46.934
and the people are unlikely
to secure a guilty verdict,"

06:47.000 --> 06:49.700
that's a verdict
beyond a reasonable doubt.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.700
That's not my standard here.

06:55.633 --> 06:59.367
The first thing that I remember
learning as a child was stick and stones

06:59.433 --> 07:01.900
will break my bones,
but names will never hurt me.

07:01.967 --> 07:05.333
You can't pick up an instrument
and use it against another human being.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.400
Period.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.467
End of discussion.

07:12.233 --> 07:15.767
[theme music playing]

07:18.767 --> 07:21.333
[narrator]
<i>Savannah Bruce claims fellow driver,</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:26.233
<i>Dianna Bellefontaine, owes</i>
<i>for lost wages from false police charges.</i>

07:26.300 --> 07:30.934
<i>Dianna is countersuing for attorney fees</i>
<i>and damages from an assault.</i>

07:31.000 --> 07:35.233
Okay. My standard here is much lower.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.934
It's a preponderance of the evidence,

07:38.000 --> 07:41.300
which means more likely than not,

07:41.367 --> 07:43.300
not clear and convincing,

07:43.367 --> 07:45.600
not beyond a reasonable doubt,

07:45.667 --> 07:47.567
preponderance of the evidence.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.133
So, your claim is self-defense,

07:51.200 --> 07:54.433
because according to you,
as a result of this action,

07:54.500 --> 07:57.900
it's on your papers,
and you can't get a job.

07:57.967 --> 07:59.800
I wouldn't actually say
it's being blacklisted.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.033
You were arrested for an assault,

08:02.100 --> 08:04.467
which you were not found not guilty of,

08:04.533 --> 08:05.800
you were not found guilty of.

08:05.867 --> 08:09.767
The court declined to hear the case
in the interest of justice,

08:09.834 --> 08:11.767
probably because you have no record.

08:11.834 --> 08:12.934
I have a clean record, yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.400
[Judy] You have a clean record.

08:14.467 --> 08:16.834
The court said,
"Oh, she looks like a nice girl.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.767
She has no prior record." How old are you?

08:18.834 --> 08:19.667
Twenty-six.

08:19.734 --> 08:20.934
[Judy] So, you're 26 years old.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
"We have other more
important things to do."

08:23.066 --> 08:25.100
The defendant,
on the other hand, has a counterclaim.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.400
Defendant says, there was this incident,

08:27.467 --> 08:30.133
she did get out of her car,
she went over to your car

08:30.200 --> 08:32.266
because she was trying
to get back into the lane,

08:32.333 --> 08:34.400
you weren't letting her
get back into the lane

08:34.467 --> 08:36.200
because she thought a lane was open,

08:36.266 --> 08:37.266
it turned out it was closed,

08:37.333 --> 08:38.900
so she was trying
to get back into her lane.

08:38.967 --> 08:43.333
And you were inching up,
not allowing her back into the lane.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.734
She got out of her car,
probably very irritated,

08:45.800 --> 08:48.533
came over to your car,
and probably started to yell at you.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.700
-Would that be fair?
-[Dianna] That's true.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.633
[Judy]
Probably started to yell at you,

08:51.700 --> 08:53.834
because I know
that you say in your answer,

08:53.900 --> 08:55.767
you went over to her

08:55.834 --> 08:59.367
and you tried to explain
what you were doing,

08:59.433 --> 09:01.333
trying to get back into the lane

09:01.400 --> 09:04.500
because the lane that you thought
was open wasn't open.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.400
It's like going to a toll booth,
it's happened...

09:06.467 --> 09:10.166
well, it doesn't happen to me,
but it happens to my husband all the time.

09:10.233 --> 09:12.734
We're standing in line,
and all of a sudden,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.500
there's no line next to you,

09:14.567 --> 09:16.133
"Oh, that's a whole new line.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.967
I guess nobody else sees that."

09:18.033 --> 09:22.100
And he goes over
and that toll booth is closed.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.633
And then he has to go
begging somebody in the other lane

09:24.700 --> 09:26.900
to let him back in the lane,
"Can I go in here?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.166
Can I go in here?" I said, "They...

09:28.233 --> 09:30.533
they're not crazy about you,
they're not letting you in."

09:30.600 --> 09:34.266
And then he gets mad and more aggressive,
and he pushes the car closer,

09:34.333 --> 09:36.934
and closer, and closer,
so somebody finally lets him in.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.233
Would that be a fair statement, Sarah?

09:38.300 --> 09:39.133
Yes.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.133
[Judy] Okay.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.133
Just as long as I don't take
the whole heat for this.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.367
Oh, God.

09:43.433 --> 09:44.533
So, I know what happened.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.133
She got out, she was angry,
and it wasn't a quiet conversation.

09:48.200 --> 09:52.266
In response to her,
I assume there are statements.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.633
The court concluded
that this was a metal water bottle,

09:55.700 --> 09:57.367
not a empty Pringles can.

09:57.433 --> 10:00.967
And I assume that there are
witness statements to that effect,

10:01.033 --> 10:05.433
which I will see,
that you hit her with a bottle,

10:05.500 --> 10:09.800
she says, causing a split lip,
which clearly is an assault.

10:09.867 --> 10:14.033
It also says that as a result of this,
she had a pre-existing heart condition,

10:14.100 --> 10:15.300
and she suffered a heart attack.

10:15.367 --> 10:19.133
She also says that after
you were arrested and win,

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
you filed a civil case against her

10:21.266 --> 10:23.000
after this dismissal.

10:23.066 --> 10:24.867
She was forced to get an attorney.

10:24.934 --> 10:25.834
You got a lawyer?

10:25.900 --> 10:26.767
I did not get a lawyer.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.433
-[Judy] You filed it yourself?
-Yes.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.934
[Judy] And you were seeking
what kind of damages from her?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.734
-[Savannah] Loss of wages.
-[Judy] How much?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.800
-Ten thousand dollars.
-[Judy] Uh-hmm.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.133
Did you have any legal advice
when you filed that case?

10:37.200 --> 10:38.133
Not much.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.567
[Judy]
What does that mean, not much?

10:39.633 --> 10:42.600
By not a smart lawyer,
or you didn't talk to the lawyer much,

10:42.667 --> 10:44.033
or what does that mean?

10:44.100 --> 10:46.400
Okay. I didn't have legal advice.

10:46.467 --> 10:47.767
Well, I don't think I believe that.

10:47.834 --> 10:49.400
I have a friend who's a lawyer.

10:49.467 --> 10:50.500
[Judy] Well, that's a lawyer,

10:50.567 --> 10:54.333
that the lawyer happens to be a friend,
the friend is not a stupid lawyer?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.133
-Hopefully not.
-[Judy] Okay.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.533
And so, you know,
this friend who's a lawyer

10:58.600 --> 11:02.100
suggested that
once this criminal case was dismissed

11:02.166 --> 11:04.667
and you couldn't get
a job anymore with Uber,

11:04.734 --> 11:07.667
that you could file a civil case
against her for false arrest?

11:07.734 --> 11:08.834
-Yes.
-[Judy] Would that be right?

11:08.900 --> 11:10.600
-So good to be around here for so long.
-[audience laughs]

11:10.667 --> 11:15.133
Okay. You are seeking damages
in the amount of $10,000 for the assault?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.166
-Uh-hmm. Yes.
-[Judy] Okay. Now...

11:16.233 --> 11:17.066
Yes, Your Honor.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.467
[Judy]
...so we're gonna start with you

11:18.533 --> 11:19.767
because that's where it starts.

11:19.834 --> 11:20.767
Uh-hmm.

11:20.834 --> 11:21.867
-[Judy] Right?
-Yes.

11:21.934 --> 11:23.700
[Judy]
You're both sitting in your cars,

11:23.767 --> 11:28.400
waiting to get to a single queue
in order to pay for the car wash?

11:28.467 --> 11:31.400
I had pulled
into the car wash long before her,

11:31.467 --> 11:34.033
thirty to 45 seconds before her. I was...

11:34.100 --> 11:36.133
-That's not long before.
-[Dianna] Well, it...

11:36.200 --> 11:38.166
Thirty to forty-five seconds
is not long before.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.100
[Dianna]
In the way that you summarized it,

11:40.166 --> 11:41.667
you said that she was there
at the same time as me

11:41.734 --> 11:43.133
and I changed my mind.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.333
Well, no, I had been sitting there
when she arrived on, on the scene.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.533
I had already turned my wheels,

11:48.600 --> 11:51.300
waiting for the traffic to advance,

11:51.367 --> 11:54.400
so I could complete the merge
when she pulled up.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.667
I did not see her car
until she cut me off.

11:57.734 --> 12:00.834
There was no one behind me
for 30 to 45 seconds.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.300
And then, out of the corner of my eye,
I could see,

12:03.367 --> 12:07.000
all of a sudden, another car
on the scene and cutting me off.

12:07.066 --> 12:09.000
And I looked over

12:09.066 --> 12:11.734
to try and make eye contact
with this person,

12:11.800 --> 12:13.133
but the windows were all...

12:13.200 --> 12:14.266
were completely black,

12:14.333 --> 12:16.300
I couldn't see the driver at all.

12:16.367 --> 12:20.266
And so the traffic advanced again
and I moved up and so did she.

12:20.333 --> 12:24.266
And this happened probably three times
before I said, "That's it."

12:24.333 --> 12:26.834
You know, I-I got to tell her
because I can't...

12:26.900 --> 12:29.500
I can't see her through her windows
or this person.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.700
So, I got out, she rolled down her window.

12:31.767 --> 12:34.934
And immediately,
we both started shouting at each other.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.867
And her car is small,
it's low to the ground.

12:37.934 --> 12:39.467
-[Judy] What were you...
-And so I had to bend over.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.400
[Judy] Well, just a second,
what were you saying to her

12:41.467 --> 12:42.967
and what was she saying to you?

12:43.033 --> 12:44.567
[Dianna] Well, we were both shouting...

12:44.633 --> 12:45.867
Expletives?

12:45.934 --> 12:46.967
Yes.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.867
I'm not proud of that.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.066
-That I can visualize.
-[Dianna] Yes.

12:51.133 --> 12:54.066
Okay. And so, you leaned over into her car

12:54.133 --> 12:57.300
and you were screaming at each other,
which I assume you were.

12:57.367 --> 12:59.367
-Uh-hmm.
-You did see her car

12:59.433 --> 13:00.967
trying to get back into the lane.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.667
Don't say no.

13:02.734 --> 13:04.233
I saw her trying to cut me off and...

13:04.300 --> 13:06.500
[Judy] You saw her
trying to either cut you off

13:06.567 --> 13:07.834
or get back into the lane?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.200
Yes.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.700
Were your windows tinted?

13:10.767 --> 13:11.767
-[Savannah] My back windows...
-That's a...

13:11.834 --> 13:13.066
-[Savannah] ...are tinted.
-Yes.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.600
And the front passenger seat?

13:15.667 --> 13:17.633
Kind of tinted,
but not as tinted as the back.

13:17.700 --> 13:18.800
-[Judy] Correct.
-Yes.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.433
[Judy] The only one
that's not tinted is the windshield.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.333
-[Savannah] Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.100
What kind of car were you driving?

13:24.166 --> 13:26.433
A Subaru WRX.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.033
And what happened next?

13:28.100 --> 13:29.367
[Dianna] And I bent down

13:29.433 --> 13:31.433
and I started to point to the lane closure

13:31.500 --> 13:34.600
because I wasn't able to make eye contact.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.400
So, when I finally got her attention,

13:36.467 --> 13:39.100
I turned my head and I started pointing
that that lane was closed

13:39.166 --> 13:41.600
when she bashed me with a Hydro Flask.

13:41.667 --> 13:45.767
Only, it was a Hydro Flask
that had probably ice in it and water.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.934
It was heavy and it split my lip.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.900
-Do you have photographs of your injury?
-Yes, I do, Your Honor.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.600
[Judy]
I'd like to see them, please.

13:57.667 --> 13:58.767
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.266
-[Dianna] They required two stitches.
-[Judy] Just a second.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.066
-Do you have hospital record?
-[Dianna] Yes.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.233
[Judy] May I see them, please?

14:16.367 --> 14:18.400
I'm gonna wait for you, Ms. Bruce,

14:18.467 --> 14:23.233
now to tell me your version
of the events of the 31st of July.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.300
[Savannah] Okay.

14:24.367 --> 14:27.333
I was in line to get my car wash
to continue driving for Uber.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.467
It was way before you pay,
before you merge.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.066
I was over here in the left lane.

14:32.133 --> 14:34.633
Ms. Bellefontaine was in the right lane
about a car ahead of me

14:34.700 --> 14:36.000
and she starts cutting me off,

14:36.066 --> 14:38.066
she crossed two white lines to do it,
and I was...

14:38.133 --> 14:40.533
I'm still unsure
why she was trying to cut me off.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.100
Well, she was trying
to get in line ahead of you?

14:42.166 --> 14:43.333
Like an entitled Karen kind of thing.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.967
Just a second, she was trying
to get in line ahead of you?

14:47.033 --> 14:48.033
-Yes. Before...
-[Judy] Okay.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.767
...you're supposed to.
I would understand if it was time for...

14:49.834 --> 14:51.500
[Judy] No, I understand she was

14:51.567 --> 14:53.867
-trying to get in line ahead of you?
-Yes.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.767
And?

14:54.834 --> 14:56.233
[Savannah] So, we were jockeying

14:56.300 --> 14:58.433
for position for about 30 seconds,

14:58.500 --> 14:59.667
she gets out of her car,

14:59.734 --> 15:01.500
and walks up to my passenger side window.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.300
I had my windows down, so it was nice.

15:03.367 --> 15:04.667
I don't like to run my air conditioner

15:04.734 --> 15:05.767
waiting in line that long

15:05.834 --> 15:07.700
and she sticks her head in my window.

15:07.767 --> 15:08.967
Am I allowed to cuss?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.233
No. I understand you were cursing,
she didn't curse...

15:10.300 --> 15:11.467
-[Savannah] Okay. Yeah.
-You don't have...

15:11.533 --> 15:14.834
"What the... doing?"
I didn't exchange any words with her.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.600
I went into fight and flight mode,
picked up a Pringle can

15:17.667 --> 15:19.600
which was the nearest thing
I had next to me,

15:19.667 --> 15:21.233
bopped her with it, it served its purpose.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.133
She got her head out of my car.

15:23.200 --> 15:27.000
I pulled away, I didn't feel
I needed to be there and I got away.

15:30.033 --> 15:32.400
The level of your arrogance to me

15:32.467 --> 15:35.133
in suing her for your lost wages,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.467
the level of your arrogance
is astronomical.

15:37.533 --> 15:38.967
I have a kid to support.

15:39.033 --> 15:41.533
I don't care whether you have
10 kids to support.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.533
[theme music playing]

15:53.533 --> 15:58.300
[narrator] <i>Savannah Bruce has accused</i>
<i>fellow driver Dianna Bellefontaine</i>

15:58.367 --> 16:00.500
<i>of cutting her off at a car wash</i>

16:00.567 --> 16:02.900
<i>and filing a false police report.</i>

16:02.967 --> 16:06.033
<i>Dianna is countersuing,</i>
<i>claiming she was assaulted</i>

16:06.100 --> 16:08.166
<i>during the confrontation with Savannah.</i>

16:08.233 --> 16:09.700
Okay. Do you have a police report?

16:09.767 --> 16:11.400
Does anyone have a police report?

16:11.467 --> 16:12.467
Yes.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.066
Your Honor,
I also have pictures of the car wash

16:16.133 --> 16:18.567
where it says
"Please form two lanes," in the...

16:18.633 --> 16:19.633
-I...
-[Savannah] Okay.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.433
...am taking for granted that she tried,

16:22.500 --> 16:26.567
either tried to get back into lane
or tried to get in front of you.

16:26.633 --> 16:27.734
I believe that.

16:28.834 --> 16:31.133
I don't believe that
that entitles you to pick up

16:31.200 --> 16:33.834
a dangerous instrument
and strike her with it.

16:33.900 --> 16:36.700
Neither did the court
that dismissed your case.

16:43.834 --> 16:44.834
Okay.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.533
You originally lied to the police.

16:47.600 --> 16:48.767
-You.
-What did I say?

16:48.834 --> 16:51.900
This is the police report
of his conversation with you.

16:51.967 --> 16:56.500
"I asked Savannah if she hit Dianna
with any type of a water bottle.

16:56.567 --> 16:58.300
Savannah denied hitting Dianna

16:58.367 --> 17:02.033
and stated there was not
any physical contact."

17:02.100 --> 17:03.734
That's not what you just told me.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.867
That's not what I stated to the police.

17:04.934 --> 17:06.800
I said I did not hit her
with a water bottle.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.200
[Judy]
That's not what it says here.

17:08.266 --> 17:10.767
There was also, in this police report,

17:10.834 --> 17:13.633
a statement of a person.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.233
Neither one of you know the witness, John.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.133
Uh-uh.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.166
I assume not.

17:18.233 --> 17:22.066
This is just the person
who was behind you in the car wash.

17:22.133 --> 17:23.033
Uh-hmm.

17:23.100 --> 17:25.400
[Judy]
That person stated in the police report,

17:25.467 --> 17:29.734
John observed as both drivers
were merging and not backing down.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.734
John watched as Dianna, that's you,

17:31.800 --> 17:34.700
got out of her car
and approached the Subaru,

17:34.767 --> 17:35.934
that would be you.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.200
John observed Dianna get hit

17:39.266 --> 17:43.000
with some type of canteen-style
water bottle,

17:43.066 --> 17:44.800
Dianna went back to her car

17:44.867 --> 17:47.700
and the Subaru made an eight-point turn

17:47.767 --> 17:50.266
and turned around to leave the car wash.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.834
John wrote down
the license plate of the Subaru.

17:53.900 --> 17:58.133
If the witness made that statement
that neither one of you know

17:58.200 --> 18:01.000
and has absolutely no skin
in the game made this report,

18:01.066 --> 18:05.400
and if he was able
to see her get hit in the mouth

18:05.467 --> 18:08.700
with some sort of a water bottle canteen,

18:08.767 --> 18:11.567
then her face was not inside your car

18:11.633 --> 18:13.867
because he wouldn't
have been able to see that

18:13.934 --> 18:15.633
if her face was inside your car,

18:15.700 --> 18:19.033
as you stated it was in your complaint

18:19.100 --> 18:20.433
that you filed for me.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.500
So, Ms. Bruce, there are a couple
of things that I'm going to say to you.

18:23.567 --> 18:26.266
First of all, I can actually understand

18:26.333 --> 18:27.500
how these things get started.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.233
And it's really stupid,

18:29.300 --> 18:32.433
but you don't have the right
to use a dangerous instrument

18:32.500 --> 18:35.700
or something
that is not a dangerous instrument,

18:35.767 --> 18:39.000
but when utilized by you
became a dangerous instrument

18:39.066 --> 18:40.967
causing injury to somebody.

18:41.033 --> 18:42.433
You have no right to do that,

18:42.500 --> 18:46.867
because what had happened
was bad words, angry words.

18:46.934 --> 18:51.166
And the first thing that I remember
learning as a child was sticks and stones

18:51.233 --> 18:53.266
will break my bones,
but names will never hurt me,

18:54.433 --> 18:57.967
which means if she called you
whatever name she wants to call you,

18:58.033 --> 19:01.533
you can't pick up an instrument
and use it as a dangerous instrument

19:01.600 --> 19:03.900
against another human being.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.200
Period.

19:05.266 --> 19:06.400
End of discussion.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.900
Whatever the words are,

19:07.967 --> 19:12.000
the words are not sufficient
for you to injure somebody.

19:12.066 --> 19:14.333
There's another legal inference

19:14.400 --> 19:17.367
and that is when you assault someone,

19:17.433 --> 19:22.333
you take the victim
with all of their history.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.867
In this case,
you hit a victim with a cardiac history.

19:26.934 --> 19:31.734
And she landed not only in the hospital
with a split lip that required suturing,

19:31.800 --> 19:34.200
but she also had a heart attack.

19:34.266 --> 19:37.600
And the level of your arrogance to me

19:37.667 --> 19:40.533
in suing her
after this case was dismissed,

19:40.600 --> 19:44.333
not on the merits
for your lost wages is...

19:44.400 --> 19:46.900
the level of your arrogance
is astronomical.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.367
Astronomical.

19:48.433 --> 19:49.667
I have a kid to support.

19:49.734 --> 19:51.567
I don't care who you support.

19:51.633 --> 19:54.266
She's not responsible for that, you are.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.367
I'm not responsible for the heart attack.

19:55.433 --> 19:56.467
[Judy] You are...

19:56.533 --> 19:59.633
you are responsible for assaulting her

19:59.700 --> 20:03.166
and causing her a split lip
and a heart attack

20:03.233 --> 20:05.967
because she had had
previous heart condition.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.200
And this incident that you created

20:09.266 --> 20:11.900
by hitting her with that water bottle,

20:11.967 --> 20:15.133
not an empty Pringles can,
that type of water bottle,

20:15.200 --> 20:18.533
so says an independent witness,
and causing her injury.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.000
You're responsible for that.

20:20.066 --> 20:23.266
She's not responsible for you
losing your job, you are.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.633
-You are.
-Can I say something?

20:24.700 --> 20:27.300
And I don't care
whether you have 10 kids to support.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.233
-May I say something?
-Sure.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.800
She was spitting at me, basically,
while she was cussing me out--

20:30.867 --> 20:32.200
[Judy] No, that's not...

20:32.266 --> 20:35.166
don't, don't use the word basically
like a 26-year-old,

20:35.233 --> 20:37.800
basically is not what she was doing.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.100
She was yelling at you.

20:39.166 --> 20:43.000
You said she was yelling at you
and spittle was coming out

20:43.066 --> 20:44.433
as she was yelling at you,

20:44.500 --> 20:45.934
so you feel threatened.

20:46.000 --> 20:46.934
Grow up!

20:47.000 --> 20:49.767
You have a kid to support.
That means you have to grow up.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.266
She doesn't owe you a thing.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.300
-So, she was okay...
-So, your case... Nope.

20:53.367 --> 20:54.967
You asked me
if you could ask me a question.

20:55.033 --> 20:56.467
-[Savannah] Yeah.
-I answered your question.

20:56.533 --> 20:59.000
I don't have to answer
any more of your questions.

20:59.066 --> 21:01.100
You were wrong.

21:01.166 --> 21:04.033
I don't say she was right
in trying to get in front of you.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.000
That's not what I'm here to adjudicate.

21:06.066 --> 21:08.667
I'm here to adjudicate your response.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.867
And your response was to assault her.

21:10.934 --> 21:12.266
And you can't do that.

21:12.333 --> 21:15.567
And if you lost your job
because of it, good.

21:15.633 --> 21:17.900
If that's the kind of temper you have,
good.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.266
And maybe you have to...

21:19.333 --> 21:22.767
maybe because you have
an immune-compromised system,

21:22.834 --> 21:25.433
you should find another venue to work

21:25.500 --> 21:26.834
other than being an Uber driver

21:26.900 --> 21:29.633
with a lot of strangers in your car,
maybe.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.567
In any event, your case is dismissed.

21:31.633 --> 21:34.100
You have a counterclaim for $10,000.

21:34.166 --> 21:37.367
That's granted,
judgment on the counterclaim for $10,000.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.200
-We're finished.
-[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

21:42.233 --> 21:43.567
It was definitely self-defense.

21:43.633 --> 21:47.500
The whole thing from the very beginning
is just unbelievable.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.266
I was very frightened
when this lady came to my car.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.367
I thought
she was going to possibly shoot me.

21:52.433 --> 21:54.533
Judge Judy said it perfectly
that the level

21:54.600 --> 21:57.200
of her arrogance is astronomical.

21:57.266 --> 22:00.266
She should know not to be putting herself
in that kind of situation.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.467
I'm not a person to be bullied.

22:02.533 --> 22:04.266
I can't even talk right now.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.800
There's a lesson for her in this,
you know, to grow up.

22:07.867 --> 22:09.734
Have you ever been the victim
of road rage?

22:09.800 --> 22:13.567
Not to this extent, but, you know,
I've gotten a few disgruntled looks

22:13.633 --> 22:15.667
or yelling from the inside of their car.

22:15.734 --> 22:17.333
-[Judy] It's frightening.
-Yeah.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
I think that the defendant,

22:19.467 --> 22:22.433
in this case, although
the successful litigant

22:22.500 --> 22:24.767
should have just been smarter,
she's older.

22:24.834 --> 22:28.433
I just don't understand that if you can
avoid that kind of confrontation.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.700
-Just let it go.
-[Judy] Over...

22:29.767 --> 22:32.066
It's not urgently important.

22:32.133 --> 22:36.367
So, you'll get to pay
for your car wash 30 seconds later.

22:36.433 --> 22:40.133
Instead, you end up
with a split lip and a heart attack.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.600
So, a couple of lessons to take away,
you stay in your car.

22:43.667 --> 22:46.367
You want to yell at another person
in the car for cutting you off?

22:46.433 --> 22:49.533
You want to give them an expletive
with one of your hands?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.834
But stay in your car.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.000
Don't get out of your car.

22:52.066 --> 22:55.367
Nothing is worth getting
into a physical altercation

22:55.433 --> 22:56.500
with somebody. That, uh...

22:56.567 --> 22:59.266
-No need to let it escalate to that level.
-Tragic. Yeah.
