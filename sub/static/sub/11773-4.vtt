00:25.633 --> 00:28.000

FOR THIS JOB.

00:28.033 --> 00:31.733

00:31.767 --> 00:33.533
AND RICHARD SAYS
THANK YOU TOO.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.767

00:34.800 --> 00:36.667
- AREN'T THESE GREAT?
- YEAH.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.333
YOU LIKE 'EM?
I COULD GET YOU A PAIR.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.300
NAH, THAT'S OKAY.
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.167
IT'S LIKE ROSS
DOWN BY THE AIRPORT--
THEY DON'T DO JUST CLOTHES.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.100
THEY DO HOUSEWARES TOO,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.667
- THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL-- I'LL--
- SO HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

00:47.700 --> 00:50.600

GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.733

00:57.433 --> 00:59.733
DOWNSTAIRS, YEAH.
SEE YOU THEN.

00:59.767 --> 01:02.067
- HE'S GREAT, ISN'T HE?
- HE IS A GOOD GUY, YEAH.

01:02.067 --> 01:03.667
I WANNA BE A PRODUCER.
HOW DO YOU BECOME
A PRODUCER?

01:03.700 --> 01:05.433
YOU KNOW,
YOU GOTTA KNOW PEOPLE.

01:05.467 --> 01:08.300
- WELL, I KNOW YOU.
- YOU KNOW ME, YEAH.
THAT'S TRUE. OKAY.

01:08.333 --> 01:12.133
- MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT
THAT SOMETIME OVER LUNCH.
- YEAH, SURE.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.500
GREAT. OKAY.
JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN...

01:14.533 --> 01:17.300
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
- ...AND I'LL WRITE IT
IN MY FILOFAX.

01:30.433 --> 01:32.467
WOW, THAT WAS QUICK.

01:35.267 --> 01:39.800
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED
TO COMMENT

01:39.833 --> 01:41.867
ON WHAT'S GOING ON

01:41.900 --> 01:44.833
- IN TERMS OF THAT
OR ANYTHING.
- OH, OKAY. I'M SORRY.

01:44.867 --> 01:47.233
OKAY.
- BY THE WAY, HOW DO YOU
GET HERE IN THE MORNING?

01:47.267 --> 01:50.800
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
GETTING HERE ON TIME.
WHAT IF WE CARPOOLED?

01:50.833 --> 01:53.133
I REALLY GOTTA GET BACK,
OKAY? SO...

01:53.167 --> 01:55.067
OKAY, MAYBE YOU COULD
THINK ABOUT IT AND...

01:55.100 --> 01:58.300
YEAH, WE'RE NOT--
WE PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE
TO WORK THAT OUT,

01:58.333 --> 02:00.367
BUT I'LL--
WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.300
YOU HAVE ONE OF THOSE
HEALTHY CARS.

02:02.333 --> 02:03.933
HOW DOES IT WORK?

02:03.967 --> 02:06.767
YOU PUT YOUR FOOTON THE GAS.

02:09.133 --> 02:11.300
IT WAS LIKE HAVING
A BATHROOM MONITOR.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.633
- I HAVE A BATHROOM MONITOR.
- OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.800
WHY DON'T YOU GO AT HOME,
LIKE I DO?

02:15.833 --> 02:17.200
I DON'T LIKE
TO GO IN MY HOUSE.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.167
WHO DOESN'T LIKE
TO GO IN THEIR HOUSE?

02:19.200 --> 02:21.833
CHERYL HAS-- YOU KNOW,
SHE'S AN ENVIRONMENTALIST.

02:21.867 --> 02:24.067
SHE HAS THIS RECYCLED

02:24.067 --> 02:25.967
POST-CONSUMER TOILET PAPER
ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

02:26.067 --> 02:28.133
- OH.
- IT'S COARSE.

02:28.167 --> 02:30.067
IT'S LIKE GOING
TO THE PORT AUTHORITY

02:30.100 --> 02:31.467
- OR A WHALING VESSEL.
- A WHALING VESSEL!

02:31.500 --> 02:35.767
I CAN'T GO HERE
AND I CAN'T GO THERE.
IT'S HORRIBLE.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.400
OH, JEEZ.

02:37.433 --> 02:40.267
ALL RIGHT,LET'S GO TO LUNCH.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.833
I LOVE THAT
YOU HAVE A RESTAURANT
IN YOUR BUILDING.

02:44.933 --> 02:46.767
- OH, AND LARRY...
- MMM.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.933
AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR CHA CHA.

02:48.967 --> 02:50.567
- THAT HAS WORKED OUT
VERY WELL.
- WHAT?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.367
- CHA CHA.
SHE'S BEEN WONDERFUL.
- OH MY GOD, CHA CHA?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.500
- CHA CHA'S BEEN WONDERFUL.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:54.533 --> 02:57.567
I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING
EVEN RECOMMENDED HER.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.367
- NO NO.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LIE TO ME.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.367
OKAY? YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LIE TO ME.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.833
NO, I WOULDN'T.
NO, SHE'S WORKED OUT
VERY WELL.

03:03.867 --> 03:05.800
- NO, SHE'S TERRIBLE.
- BETTER THAN EXPECTED.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.767
SHE'S TERRIBLE AND
IF YOU WANT TO FIRE HER,
GO AHEAD.

03:07.800 --> 03:09.133
OH, RIGHT.
NO NO.

03:09.167 --> 03:10.633
- DON'T KEEP HER
ON MY ACCOUNT, OKAY?
- I WON'T.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.333
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HURT MY FEELINGS
IF YOU FIRE HER.

03:12.367 --> 03:14.500
WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH HER.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

03:14.533 --> 03:16.067
I TELL YOU WHAT:
I'VE NOTICED THAT
EVERY TIME

03:16.100 --> 03:19.333
I PASS YOUR OFFICE--
THAT SHE'S NOT WORKING,

03:19.367 --> 03:22.500
THAT SHE'S READING OR
TALKING ON THE PHONE.
BY THE WAY--

03:22.533 --> 03:25.533
WELL, THAT'S HER JOB.
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO--
SHE'S A RECEPTIONIST.

03:25.567 --> 03:29.333
SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO USE OBSCENITIES
EVERY OTHER WORD,

03:29.367 --> 03:33.067
SAY "FUCK" AND
"FUCK THIS, CUNT THAT"
THE WHOLE TIME?

03:33.067 --> 03:34.267
- Susie: YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.200
- THE "C" WORD?
- IT'S TRUE, I SWEAR.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.600
OH, SHE'S BEEN VERY--
SHE REALLY CAME ALONG

03:39.633 --> 03:41.767
AT A GOOD TIME
FOR ALL OF US.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.300
I AM VERY IMPRESSED,
BARBARA, THAT YOU ARE
HERE TODAY.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.067
- OH, THANK YOU. ME TOO.
- THEY'VE GOT NINE KIDS.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.067
- Susie: NINE KIDS?
NINE KIDS?
- YEAH. YEAH.

03:48.067 --> 03:51.367
- Jeff: NINE KIDS?
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
- Barbara: I KNOW.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.467
Larry:
JESUS, YOU'RE KIDDING.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.667
IT'S A LITTLE EGOTISTICAL
THOUGH, ISN'T IT...

03:54.700 --> 03:56.333
Burt:
NO, IT'S REALLY
NOT UP TO US.

03:56.367 --> 03:58.067
...TO HAVE
SO MANY OF YOU?

03:58.067 --> 04:00.733
YOU WANT TO BRING
SO MUCH MORE OF YOU
INTO THE WORLD.

04:00.767 --> 04:03.067
HEY HEY HEY,
YOU SHOULD TELL LARRY
ABOUT YOUR DAD'S SHOP.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.700
OH, MY DAD HAS OPENED
THIS BARBERSHOP.

04:05.733 --> 04:08.067
HE WANTS YOU BOTH TO COME,
SPECIAL INVITATION.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.433
COMPLETELY RETRO,
VERY OLD-SCHOOL.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.333
- YOU MEAN,
LIKE THE OLD BARBERSHOPS?
- OH YEAH, WITH THE POLE.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.900
I LOVE THAT.
WHAT A GREAT IDEA.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.867
- THE FIRST THING
HE DID WAS GET THE POLE.
- I'M GONNA GO.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.300
- Jeff: I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.
- DOES HE DO THE HOT TOWELS?

04:18.333 --> 04:21.067
- SHOULD WE GO
TO THE BARBERSHOP?
- I'M WITH YOU. LET'S GO.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.067
- WE'RE GONNA GO.
- YEAH, GET A CUT
AND A SHAVE.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.500
- A LITTLE AQUA VELVA?
- Susie: LIKE "THE GODFATHER."

04:26.533 --> 04:28.167
Waiter:
I HOPE THAT YOU
ENJOYED YOUR LUNCH.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.467
Jeff: DAVIDAY,
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.067
GOOD.
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

04:31.067 --> 04:32.933
THAT WE ARE GOING TO SEND
OUR AUTUMN FOOD JELLIES

04:32.967 --> 04:36.067
MADE OF CONCENTRATED
SUGAR, APRICOTS

04:36.067 --> 04:37.767
AND WINTER FRUITS
AND NUTS.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.167
- Susie: OH, DELICIOUS.
- WINTER FRUITS.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.633
- A NICE TREAT,
A NICE TREAT.
- YUMMY.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.900
NOW TELL ME,
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

04:43.933 --> 04:46.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU COULD WRAP THIS UP
FOR ME TO TAKE HOME.

04:46.233 --> 04:49.300
VERY GOOD.
YOU'RE GOING TO WARM THAT
UP FOR A NICE LUNCHEON?

04:49.333 --> 04:52.133
UH, NO, ACTUALLY.
IT'S FOR THE DOG.

04:53.367 --> 04:55.400
WE HAVE A POLICY
THAT WE DO NOT GIVE FOOD

04:55.433 --> 04:57.933
THAT WAS
PREPARED FOR PEOPLE
TO ANIMALS.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.767
WELL, I'M GIVING THIS
TO THE DOG.
YOU'RE NOT.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
SO JUST WRAP IT UP.
I'LL GIVE IT
TO THE DOG.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.133
NO, THAT IS THE POLICY
OF THE RESTAURANT.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.400
ALL RIGHT, DAVIDAY,
FORGET I SAID IT.

05:06.433 --> 05:08.700
JUST WRAP IT UP.
I'M TAKING IT HOME.
OKAY?

05:08.733 --> 05:11.467
WE DO NOT GIVE
DOGGY BAGS TO DOGS.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.433
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY CALL IT A GODDAMN
DOGGY BAG, HUH?

05:14.467 --> 05:16.067
IF YOU WANT
TO FEED AN ANIMAL,
WHY DON'T YOU

05:16.067 --> 05:18.367
GO TO PETCO
AND GET A BAG OF KIBBLE?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.733
WELL, I GIVE HIM KIBBLE
AND I LIKE TO SPICE IT UP

05:20.767 --> 05:23.867
- WITH A LITTLE STEAK
EVERY NOW AND THEN.
- I CAN BRING YOU CORN.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.567
- I DON'T WANT CORN.
THIS IS MY STEAK.
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:25.600 --> 05:26.767
- HEY HEY HEY.
- WHAT?

05:26.800 --> 05:30.233
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT HOME.

05:30.267 --> 05:33.367
- Susie: OH, OKAY.
- DO YOU MIND?
DO YOU MIND?

05:33.400 --> 05:36.400
- YOU TAKE IT HOME.
- DAVIDAY, I'M GONNA
TAKE THIS HOME.

05:36.433 --> 05:38.200
- DO YOU HAVE AN ANIMAL?
- NO.

05:38.233 --> 05:41.600
- DOES HE HAVE AN ANIMAL?
- NO.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.600
SO YOU ARE GOING
TO EAT THAT?

05:43.633 --> 05:44.600
YES.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.167
- YOU PROMISE ME?
- YEAH.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.967
WE SHALL SEE.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.367
- Susie: A FUCKING NUTJOB.
- "WE SHALL SEE"?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.733
- Susie: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- Larry: IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY

06:00.767 --> 06:02.700
THAT YOU CAN'T
GIVE A DOGGY BAG
TO A DOG.

06:02.733 --> 06:05.633
- Jeff: IT'S NONE
OF THEIR BUSINESS.
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.167
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.133
Jeff:
YOU'RE EXCUSED.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.767
HEY, LARRY.
LONG TIME NO SEE.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.533
- HEY, CHA CHA.
- HEY.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.567
- HAVE YOU HAD
THE FRUIT PLATE HERE?
- NO.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.067
- IT'S EXCELLENT.
- REALLY?

06:21.067 --> 06:22.867
- YOU HAVE TO TRY IT.
TASTE THIS.
- NO, PLEASE.

06:22.900 --> 06:26.633
- IT'S THE RIPEST CANTALOUPE.
- I'VE HAD FRUIT.
FRUIT'S FRUIT PRETTY MUCH.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.233
WHAT DID YOU HAVE
FOR LUNCH?

06:29.267 --> 06:31.067
- I HAD SOME CHICKEN.
- CHICKEN?

06:31.067 --> 06:33.500
CHICKEN AND FRUIT GO TOGETHER.
YOU CAN HAVE THIS FOR DESSERT.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.233
- OKAY, I GOTTA--
- IT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD.

06:35.267 --> 06:36.900
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

06:36.933 --> 06:39.233
MM, THAT TIME AGAIN, HUH?

06:57.367 --> 06:59.400
- OH, COOL, YOU'RE HERE.
I OWE YOU.
- OH, HEY.

06:59.433 --> 07:01.367
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.
I WAS JUST OVER
AT CHA CHA'S.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.200
OOH, GOD, IS SHE
BEAUTIFUL. WHEW.
JESUS.

07:04.233 --> 07:07.100
LISTEN, I HAD AN IDEA.
I WANT TO GO TO A MOVIE
TOMORROW NIGHT

07:07.133 --> 07:09.333
AND MAYBE--
IT'S BEEN A WHILE--
LET'S DOUBLE-DATE,

07:09.367 --> 07:10.933
CHA CHA AND ME
AND YOU AND CHERYL.

07:10.967 --> 07:13.833
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.500
- UH...
- WHY THE HESITATION?

07:15.533 --> 07:18.200
I DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT OUR PLANS ARE.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.933
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
I'LL CALL YOU.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.167
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:24.633 --> 07:26.700
YOU KNOW, I GOT CHA CHA
THIS JOB AND ALL...

07:26.733 --> 07:27.833
YEAH, AND SHE
LOVES YOU FOR IT.
ME TOO, BY THE WAY.

07:27.867 --> 07:31.967
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
WORKING OUT FOR ME,

07:32.067 --> 07:34.100
I GOTTA TELL YOU.

07:34.133 --> 07:35.167
WHY NOT?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.067
HER OFFICE IS RIGHT ACROSS
FROM THE BATHROOM.

07:37.067 --> 07:40.200
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- EVERY TIME I GO
TO THE BATHROOM

07:40.233 --> 07:43.333
I HAVE TO HAVE THIS--
STOP AND CHAT WITH HER

07:43.367 --> 07:47.500
BOTH BEFORE I GO
AND AFTER I GO.
IT'S TOO MUCH.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.900
SHE MEANS WELL.
BY THE WAY, SHE'S TOLD ME

07:49.933 --> 07:53.367
THAT YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM,
LIKE, 10 TO 14 TIMES A DAY.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.667
YOU MOVE YOUR BOWELS,
YOU PISS...

07:55.700 --> 07:57.467
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
SHE WAS CONCERNED.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.267
OKAY, DO YOU SEE
WHAT I'M SAYING?

07:59.300 --> 08:02.433
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
THIS IS NONE OF HER BUSINESS--

08:02.467 --> 08:04.133
HOW OFTEN I GO
TO THE BATHROOM,

08:04.167 --> 08:06.667
WHAT I'M DOING IN THERE,
HOW LONG I'M IN THERE.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.533
TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT MY PERSONAL
BATHROOM HABITS--

08:09.567 --> 08:12.533
THAT'S NOT GOOD, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S TOO MUCH.
IT'S TOO MUCH.

08:12.567 --> 08:15.267
SOMEONE'S GOT TO SIT THERE.
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
A KLANSMAN SITTING THERE?

08:15.300 --> 08:18.400
NO, I'D RATHER HAVE
A STRANGER, FRANKLY--
A STRANGER SITTING THERE

08:18.433 --> 08:20.700
WHO I DON'T HAVE TO
REPORT INTO.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.733
- SHE CARES ABOUT YOU.
- OH, SHE CARES ABOUT ME?

08:23.767 --> 08:25.900
- YEAH.
- OKAY, LISTEN,
IT'S NONE OF HER BUSINESS.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.900
SHE HAS
BOWEL CONCERN FOR YOU
AND I DO TOO.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.633
I DON'T NEED
HER BOWEL CONCERN.

08:29.667 --> 08:32.133
- HOW MUCH WATER DO YOU DRINK?
- I DRINK A LOT OF WATER,
THAT'S ALL.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.133
- BIG DEAL.
- A LOT OF WATER? YOU DRINK
MORE THAN A PORPOISE.

08:33.167 --> 08:36.300
YEAH, USUALLY I HAVE
BOTTLES OF WATER.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.167
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
- NO ONE PISSES THAT OFTEN

08:38.200 --> 08:40.167
WITHOUT DRINKING, LIKE,
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS A WEEK.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.567
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LET'S STOP
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.567
MY BATHROOM HABITS ARE NOT
YOUR CONCERN, OKAY?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.800
ALL RIGHT, I WON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR HEALTH. FINE.

08:47.833 --> 08:49.733
YOU DON'T NEED TO CARE ABOUT--
I'M IN VERY GOOD HEALTH.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.667
- YOU ARE?
- I GOT A BEAUTIFUL COLON.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.567
- YOU WANNA TAKE
A PICTURE OF MY COLON?
- I HAVE A VHS OF MINE.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.400
FINE.
YOU CAN PUT MY COLON UP
NEXT TO YOUR COLON.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.767
WE'LL SEE WHO'S GOT
A CLEANER, HEALTHIER COLON.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.567
I'LL HAVE A COLON CONTEST
WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU WANT.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.067
ANY TIME YOU WANT TO HAVE
A COLON CONTEST, BUDDY, YEAH.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.300
YOU'RE SHITTING AND PISSING
ALMOST 70 TIMES A WEEK.

09:04.333 --> 09:07.333
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

09:07.367 --> 09:08.500
SHE'S RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.067
I DON'T WANT HER
MONITORING

09:10.067 --> 09:13.700
MY BATHROOM HABITS,
OKAY?

09:13.733 --> 09:15.700
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?
A LOT OF GRAINS

09:15.733 --> 09:17.633
AND FRUIT AND NUTS
LIKE A JEW SQUIRREL?

09:17.667 --> 09:19.900
- OKAY.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:19.933 --> 09:21.167
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE BATHROOM AGAIN?

09:21.200 --> 09:22.600
NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.233
- YOU ARE GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.
- NO.

09:24.267 --> 09:26.233
I BET YOU ARE
GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.900
( screaming )

10:21.400 --> 10:22.933
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

10:22.967 --> 10:25.667
I FLUSHED A TOILET
AND IT WAS, LIKE,

10:25.700 --> 10:28.667
THE LOUDEST FLUSH,
LIKE A SONIC BOOM
WENT OFF.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.900
- IT JUST WAS SO LOUD
THAT I WAS THROWN BACK.
- REALLY?

10:31.933 --> 10:33.767
I WAS TRAPPED
INSIDE THE STALL

10:33.800 --> 10:36.433
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S KILLING ME.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.800
OKAY, SO YOU'RE HAVING
SOME PAIN THERE.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.400
- RIGHT EAR, YEAH.
- RIGHT EAR, OKAY.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.667
LET ME JUST ASK YOU
A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.533
RE YOU EXPERIENCING
ANY DIZZINESS?

10:44.567 --> 10:46.233
- NO.
- NO.

10:46.267 --> 10:48.333
- ANY SHORTNESS OF BREATH?
- NO.

10:48.367 --> 10:50.433
- ACHES AND PAINS
ANYWHERE ELSE?
- NO.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.100
ARE YOU GOING
TO THE BATHROOM A LOT?

10:53.900 --> 10:57.067
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S
RELEVANT, REALLY--

10:57.100 --> 10:58.167
AM I GOING
TO THE BATHROOM A LOT.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.367
ARE YOU URINATINGA LOT?

11:01.400 --> 11:03.067
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH MY EAR?

11:03.100 --> 11:05.167
THIS IS A STANDARD
MEDICAL QUESTION.
IT'S ALL--

11:05.200 --> 11:08.667
I KNOW, BUT I REALLY
DON'T THINK IT'S RELEVANT

11:08.700 --> 11:10.600
HOW OFTEN I GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

11:10.633 --> 11:11.900
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I THINK I'M THE ONE

11:11.933 --> 11:14.233
WHO SHOULD TELL YOU
IF IT'S RELEVANT OR NOT.
AND IT IS.

11:14.267 --> 11:18.200
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY--
LET'S JUST MOVE ON.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

11:18.233 --> 11:20.233
WHAT, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA TELL ME
ABOUT URINATION?

11:20.267 --> 11:22.433
I'D REALLY RATHER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

11:22.467 --> 11:24.900
I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S
ANYBODY'S BUSINESS,
FRANKLY, YOU KNOW.

11:24.933 --> 11:27.367
IT'S KIND OF PRIVATE
AND I REALLY DON'T THINK--

11:27.400 --> 11:29.167
- HOW IS IT PRIVATE?
- IT'S PRIVATE.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.367
HOW OFTEN
I GO TO THE BATHROOM IS
KIND OF A PRIVATE THING.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.767
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT SOME--
WE'RE NOT ON A BUS.
I'M A DOCTOR.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.900
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS
WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION.

11:36.933 --> 11:38.867
I'M NORMAL.
LET'S JUST SAY THAT, OKAY?

11:38.900 --> 11:41.467
- WHAT DOES "NORMAL" MEAN?
- EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.
IT'S NORMAL.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.533
THREE TIMES A DAY,
FOUR TIMES A DAY?

11:43.567 --> 11:44.867
DO WE HAVE TO GET
INTO A SPECIFIC NUMBER?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.667
DO WE HAVE TO GET
A NUMBER ATTACHED TO IT?

11:46.700 --> 11:49.667
- YEAH, IT'S SCIENCE.
- HOWEVER OFTEN PEOPLE ARE
SUPPOSED TO GO, I GO,

11:49.700 --> 11:51.700
UNLESS I DRINK
A LOT OF WATER.
AND, YOU KNOW,

11:51.733 --> 11:54.833
SOMETIMES
I DRINK A LOT OF WATER
AND I'LL GO A LOT.

11:54.867 --> 11:56.567
IF YOU HAD AN OFFICE
NEXT TO THE BATHROOM
AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS

11:56.600 --> 11:59.233
I WAS DRINKING A LOT OF WATER,
YOU'D SAY, "BOY, THIS GUY
GOES A LOT."

11:59.267 --> 12:01.367
BUT SO WHAT?
SO WHAT?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.167
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M TALKING ABOUT,

12:03.200 --> 12:04.967
YOU KNOW,
URINATION FREQUENCY

12:05.067 --> 12:07.167
IF I HAPPEN TO BE
DRINKING A LOT OF WATER,

12:07.200 --> 12:09.700
WHICH I HAVE
BEEN DOING LATELY,
SO MAYBE LATELY

12:09.733 --> 12:11.767
I'VE BEEN GOING MORE OFTEN
THAN I NORMALLY WOULD.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.400
- GREAT.
- BUT IT'S GOOD FOR YOU

12:13.433 --> 12:15.133
TO DRINK WATER.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.767
- THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO HEAR.
- THAT'S A GOOD THING,
DRINKING WATER.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.867
YES, SURE SURE.
OKAY, LET'S MOVE ON.

12:19.900 --> 12:20.867
PLEASE.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.967
HOW'S YOUR STOOL?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.667
- PLEASE.
- STOOL'S FINE.
LET'S MOVE ON.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.533
- ALL RIGHT.
- YOU KNOW, AGAIN,

12:29.567 --> 12:31.900
I MEAN, IF I DO
DRINK A LOT OF WATER,

12:31.933 --> 12:34.267
I EAT A LOT OF SALAD TOO.
SO THAT'S GOOD.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.600
IT'S NORMAL, OKAY?
IS IT MORE THAN ONCE A DAY?

12:36.633 --> 12:39.067
MANY TIMES IT IS, YEAH.
MORE THAN TWICE A DAY?

12:39.067 --> 12:40.900
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW.
WHO KNOWS?

12:40.933 --> 12:43.700
IF YOU HAD AN OFFICE
NEXT TO THE BATHROOM
AND I WAS GOING

12:43.733 --> 12:45.900
AND YOU LOOKED AT YOUR WATCH
AND YOU SAW HOW LONG
I WAS IN THERE,

12:45.933 --> 12:48.333
YOU MIGHT SAY,
"OH, BOY, HE GOES A LOT."

12:48.367 --> 12:50.067
BUT SO WHAT?
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.533
- ALL RIGHT, I APOLOGIZE FOR--
- LET'S JUST-- CAN WE
GET TO THE EAR?

12:52.567 --> 12:56.067
SURE SURE. SO HERE'S--
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, REALLY.
I'M GONNA SUGGEST--

12:56.067 --> 12:58.333
I'M EXHAUSTED
FROM BEING HERE,

12:58.367 --> 13:00.200
YOU KNOW, HAVING TO TALK
ABOUT MY STOOL,

13:00.233 --> 13:03.733
HOW OFTEN I'M URINATING.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
MY EAR HURTS.

13:03.767 --> 13:05.467
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA
SUGGEST FOR YOUR EAR:

13:05.500 --> 13:07.267
YOU JUST BASICALLY
STAY OFF IT.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.067
USE YOUR LEFT EAR
TO TALK ON THE PHONE

13:09.067 --> 13:12.600
IF YOU NEED TO
FOR SOME REASON FAVOR AN EAR,
FAVOR THE LEFT ONE.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.233
DON'T USE THE PHONE
FROM MY RIGHT EAR?

13:14.267 --> 13:15.567
YEAH. I MEAN,
YOU JUST WANT TO LIMIT

13:15.600 --> 13:18.300
THE AMOUNT OF NOISE
THAT GOES INTO IT.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.433
YOU WANT ME
TO TALK LEFTY?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.167
YEAH, JUST TALK LEFTY.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.067
I HAVE A HARD TIME
TALKING LEFTY ON THE PHONE.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.467
EVERYTHING COMES OUT WRONG.
IT'S LIKE THROWING LEFTY.
I CAN'T DO IT.

13:26.500 --> 13:30.067
I'M NOT MYSELF.
I FEEL DIFFERENT, STRANGE,
LIKE I'M NOT ME.

13:30.067 --> 13:33.800
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
TALKING LEFTY.

13:33.833 --> 13:37.767
ALL I CAN DO IS GIVE YOU
MY EXPERT OPINION, OKAY?

13:37.800 --> 13:40.233
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M SUGGESTING.
I'M SUGGESTING YOU STAY
OFF THE RIGHT EAR.

13:40.267 --> 13:41.867
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL TALK LEFTY.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.567
AND I ALSO THINK
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU

13:43.600 --> 13:45.433
TO TALK TO YOUR THERAPIST
ABOUT YOUR BATHROOM ISSUES,

13:45.467 --> 13:48.267
'CAUSE THERE'S CLEARLY
SOMETHING GOING ON THERE.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.367
OKAY?

13:49.400 --> 13:52.067
I THINK I'D LIKE TO SEE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

13:52.067 --> 13:54.067
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S YOUR RIGHT. FINE.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.900
IS THERE SOMEBODY
IN THE OFFICE
I COULD SEE?

13:55.933 --> 13:57.600
NOW?

13:57.633 --> 14:00.133
NO NO, YOU HAVE TO
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.467
THIS ISN'T MCDONALD'S, OKAY?

14:04.500 --> 14:06.567
OKAY, FINE.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.567
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.100
THANK YOU.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.767
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
LOOKING AT, JEWBOY?

14:21.300 --> 14:23.133
FUCKING FAGGOT.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.067
THAT'S RIGHT,
KEEP WALKING.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.900
- HEY.
- COME ON,
LET'S DEAL WITH IT.

14:38.933 --> 14:41.367
- CAN WE TALK TO YOU?
- WHAT? WOW. HEY HEY.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.067
- I LIKE CHERYL.
SHE'S SWEET, BUT...
- YEAH.

14:44.067 --> 14:48.133
SHE'S NICE,
BUT THE TOILET PAPER...

14:48.167 --> 14:50.067
I'VE NEVER SEEN NO
TOILET PAPER LIKE THAT.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.733
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO PORT AUTHORITY BEFORE,

14:51.767 --> 14:53.167
- THE PORT AUTHORITY
IN NEW YORK CITY?
- YEAH.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.200
THAT'S WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE.

14:55.233 --> 14:57.767
- REAL CLOSE.
- I SAID THE SAME THING
THE OTHER DAY.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.733
- MM-HMM.
- DID YOU GET THAT FROM ME?

14:59.767 --> 15:03.200
- YEAH.
- Y'ALL GOT SOME FUNNY KIND
OF TOILET PAPER HERE.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.567
- WE CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS TOILET PAPER.
- HEY, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.600
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S ROUGH.
- IT'S ROUGH.

15:07.633 --> 15:10.133
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL THING.

15:10.167 --> 15:13.067
SHE'S DOING IT
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
WHAT CAN I DO?

15:13.100 --> 15:15.867
CAN YOU DO US A FAVOR?
CAN WE GET SOME SOFT
TOILET PAPER TO USE?

15:15.900 --> 15:18.067
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
- Auntie Rae: THE BABIES'
BEHINDS ARE HURTING.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.467
ALL RIGHT.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.900
HERE'S WHAT
I'M GONNA SUGGEST:

15:22.933 --> 15:25.867
- YOU WANT SOFT PAPER?
- OH, YES. NO DOUBT.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.067
- I'LL GET YOU YOUR
SOFT TOILET PAPER...
- OKAY, COOL.

15:29.067 --> 15:32.233
...UNDER ONE CONDITION--

15:32.267 --> 15:34.967
I WANT ACCESS
TO THE TOILET.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.200
- YOU WANT
TO USE OUR BATHROOM?
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

15:37.233 --> 15:39.200
YOU WANT TO
COME IN OUR BATHROOM
AND USE OUR BATHROOM?

15:39.233 --> 15:40.567
YOU GOT IT.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.500
- I WANT SOME SOFT
TOILET PAPER.
- OKAY, FINE.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.533
- IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TISSUE.
- OKAY, YOU HAVE A DEAL.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.967

15:48.067 --> 15:52.100
- MY MAN.

15:52.133 --> 15:54.333
IF CHERYL FINDS OUT,

15:54.367 --> 15:55.800
YOU'RE ALL GOING DOWN
WITH ME.

15:55.833 --> 15:57.933
- WE GOT YOUR BACK.
- WE GOT YOUR BACK.

15:57.967 --> 15:59.367
- COOL.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.933
LEON, COME HERE.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

16:01.967 --> 16:03.400
WHAT'S GOING DOWN, LARRY?

16:03.433 --> 16:06.300
LISTEN TO THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.800
I'M IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE
EARLIER,

16:07.833 --> 16:10.500
THERE'S A GUY SITTING THERE,
A SKINHEAD, OKAY?

16:10.533 --> 16:12.633
HE LOOKS AT ME
AND HE SAYS,

16:12.667 --> 16:15.167
"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU
LOOKING AT, JEWBOY?"

16:15.200 --> 16:16.367
- WHAT?
- "FUCKING FAGGOT."

16:16.400 --> 16:20.367
WHAT?
OKAY, WHAT'D YOU DO?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.167
- WHAT'D I DO?
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU DO?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.600
I SLUNK OUT.

16:24.633 --> 16:25.967
YOU SLUNK OUT?

16:26.067 --> 16:27.700
SLUNK.
I SLUNK OUT.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.733
SO YOU DIDN'T DO SHIT
AND YOU PUNKED OUT.

16:29.767 --> 16:30.767
THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK
HAPPENED, RIGHT?

16:30.800 --> 16:32.800
YEAH, I PUNKED OUT.
I PUNKED OUT.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.833
- HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?
- WELL, WHAT WAS I
GONNA DO?

16:34.867 --> 16:36.067
THE GUY COULD HAVE
KILLED ME.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.767
NEXT TIME A MAN CALLS YOU
A FUCKING FAGGOT,

16:37.800 --> 16:40.333
YOU GET IN THAT ASS, LARRY.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

16:40.367 --> 16:42.667
YOU GET IN THAT ASS, LARRY.
THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK YOU DO.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.600
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU LET THAT MAN SLIDE TODAY.

16:44.633 --> 16:47.767
YOU GOTTA IMMEDIATELY
GET IN SOMEBODY'S ASS
WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO YOU.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.267
YOU PULL THEIR
ASSHOLE OPEN,

16:49.300 --> 16:51.400
STEP INTO THEIR ASSHOLE,
CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND YOU,

16:51.433 --> 16:53.067
- PICK UP YOUR SPRAY-PAINT
CAN, RIGHT?
- UH-HUH.

16:53.100 --> 16:55.233
"LARRY WAS HERE."
YOU SPRAY-PAINT

16:55.267 --> 16:58.300
"LARRY WAS HERE," "WASH ME,"
ALL THAT KIND OF SHIT,

16:58.333 --> 17:00.333
FUCK HIS WHOLE ASSHOLE UP,
EAT SOME SNICKERS BAR,

17:00.367 --> 17:02.167
THROW SOME PAPER ON THE FLOOR,

17:02.200 --> 17:04.867
BALL THE PAPER UP,

17:04.900 --> 17:06.800
FUCK HIS WHOLE ASSHOLE UP,

ONE MORE TIME--

17:08.333 --> 17:10.867
OPEN IT AGAIN,
OPEN THAT ASSHOLE AGAIN-
UHH!

17:10.900 --> 17:13.833
STEP OUT OF HIS ASS
AND LEAVE THAT MOTHERFUCKER
WIDE OPEN,

17:13.867 --> 17:15.800

YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
- OPEN IT UP,

17:15.833 --> 17:17.133

17:28.933 --> 17:31.233
- YOU FEEL ME?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.200
THAT'S HOW
YOU HANDLE PEOPLE.

17:33.233 --> 17:35.300
MM!
GET IN THAT ASS, LARRY.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.733

17:38.400 --> 17:40.567
I HOPE YOU DON'T
GET ME KILLED.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.533
MY MAN.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.767
( line ringing )

17:57.733 --> 17:59.667
( huffing )

18:03.233 --> 18:05.433
- HELLO?
- HEY, IS RICHARD THERE?

18:05.467 --> 18:08.467
UH, NO, HE'S NOT.
IS THIS LARRY?

18:08.500 --> 18:09.833
YEAH.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.267
- This is Cha Cha.
- AH.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.900
( chuckles )
- CHA CHA.

18:13.933 --> 18:16.967
HI, LARRY.
YOU JUST CAUGHT ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF A WORKOUT.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.867
SO I'M CALLING
ABOUT THE MOVIES.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.367
Yeah, the movies, right.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.967
YOU KNOW,
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT--
WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT

18:22.067 --> 18:24.500
if we could all go
to a really nice dinner

18:24.533 --> 18:26.767
in one of those
fancy-schmancy joints?

18:26.800 --> 18:31.067
OKAY, I'LL TELL--
I'LL TELL CHERYL.

18:31.067 --> 18:32.367
GREAT.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.200
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

18:37.833 --> 18:39.967
WHAT AM I WEARING
RIGHT NOW?

18:40.067 --> 18:41.700
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
WEARING?

18:41.733 --> 18:45.567
YOU'RE MAKING ME
UNCOMFORTABLE, LARRY.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.133
( groaning )

18:50.200 --> 18:51.467
1- ( moaning )
- I'M GONNA HANG UP
RIGHT NOW.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.267
'M GONNA
HANG UP RIGHT NOW.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.333
- Goodbye.
- BYE.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.633
I AM LOVING THIS PLACE.
JEFF, HOW GREAT IS
THIS PLACE?

19:03.667 --> 19:06.067
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.800
IT'S LIKE MY OLD
BARBERSHOP IN BROOKLYN.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.433
YEAH, REMINDS ME
OF THE OLD DAYS, YOU KNOW.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.433
I LIKE THE WHOLE
SNIP-SNIP THING,
THE SOUND OF IT.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.900
I THINK I CAN DO IT TOO.
IT DOESN'T LOOK
THAT HARD.

19:14.933 --> 19:16.967
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE THE BONGOS--
WHO CAN'T DO THAT?

19:17.067 --> 19:18.400
- ( laughs )
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:18.433 --> 19:20.400
- YEAH.
- ANYBODY CAN PLAY
THE BONGOS, COME ON.

19:20.433 --> 19:23.867
DO YOU HAVE TO
BE THAT SKILLED
TO BANG ON SOMETHING?

19:23.900 --> 19:27.400
- COME ON, HOW HARD IS THAT?
- I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.600
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW BURT?

19:29.633 --> 19:31.533
OH, I JUST
HAD LUNCH WITH HIM

19:31.567 --> 19:33.067
THE OTHER DAY,
HIM AND BARBARA.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.100
YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM?

19:35.133 --> 19:37.800
NO.

19:37.833 --> 19:40.967
'CAUSE SHE JUST HAD
A MISCARRIAGE.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.667
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.433
IT'S A SHAME.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.067
SHAME?

19:46.067 --> 19:48.400
THEY DO HAVE NINE KIDS.

19:53.467 --> 19:55.167
- THAT'S IT?
- YEP.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.733
WOW, THAT WAS
PRETTY FAST.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.833
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN
ANYTHING OFF.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.133
HEY!
( screaming )

20:12.467 --> 20:14.567
I'M GOOD.

20:19.367 --> 20:20.467
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.367
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
ALL GODDAMN DAY.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.867
- WE WERE GETTING A HAIRCUT.
- THIS IS A BAG OF SHIT.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.333
OSCAR'S BEEN SHITTING.
I'VE BEEN CLEANING UP
SHIT ALL DAY.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.567
HE ATE THOSE LEFTOVERS
THAT THAT ASSHOLE GAVE US.

20:30.600 --> 20:33.333
- REALLY?
- "WE SHALL SEE."

20:33.367 --> 20:36.200
- "WE SHALL SEE." DAVIDAY.
- THAT LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.567
- IS THAT POSSIBLE,
THAT THAT NUT DID THAT?
- YES YES.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.600
- HE PUT CRAP IN THERE.
HE PUT SOMETHING IN THERE.
- JESUS CHRIST.

20:41.633 --> 20:43.067
- Jeff: IS HE THROWING UP TOO?
- WHAT A PSYCHO.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.167
YOU GOTTA GO DOWN THERE
AND TELL THIS MOTHERFUCKER

20:45.200 --> 20:47.267
- YOU'RE GONNA KICK HIS ASS.
- OH, YEAH.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.700
NO, WAIT A SECOND.
HE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE.

20:49.733 --> 20:52.000
- WHY?
- BECAUSE I TOOK
THE FOOD HOME.

20:52.033 --> 20:55.767
- I PROMISED HIM
THAT I WOULD EAT IT.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GO DOWN THERE.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.433
- YOU GO.
- YEAH, BETTER IDEA:

20:57.467 --> 20:59.433
YOU GO, LARRY.
YOU GO TELL HIM

20:59.467 --> 21:01.267
THAT YOU'VE BEEN SHITTING
ALL OVER YOURSELF ALL DAY,

21:01.300 --> 21:03.667
SHITTING IN YOUR PANTS,
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT
TO THE TOILET,

21:03.700 --> 21:05.533
YOU GOT SHIT
RUNNING DOWN YOUR LEG.

21:05.567 --> 21:06.800
WHY CAN'T I MAKE IT
TO THE TOILET?

21:06.833 --> 21:09.167
BECAUSE IT'S MORE DRAMATIC
THAT WAY.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.167
I DON'T WANNA TELL A GUY
I GOT SHIT RUNNING
DOWN MY LEG.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.733
ALL RIGHT, TELL HIM
WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT.
TELL HIM YOU'VE BEEN

21:12.767 --> 21:16.333
- SICK SICK
SICK AS A DOG, OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

21:16.367 --> 21:17.667
I'M GONNA GO
TO THE RESTAURANT
RIGHT NOW,

21:17.700 --> 21:19.400
- SEE WHAT HE SAYS.
- GO!

21:19.433 --> 21:22.400
- YOU KNOW,
THESE WAITERS ARE NUTS.
- Jeff: HE'S NUTS.

21:22.433 --> 21:25.333
YOU CAN'T GET
ON A WAITER'S BAD SIDE.
THEY'LL DO ANYTHING.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.067
- Jeff: I NEVER
SAID ANYTHING BACK.
- YOU GOTTA BE SO NICE TO 'E.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.533
YOU GOTTA LEAVE
A GOOD TIP.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.567
- JEFF, THROW THIS OUT.
- YOU THROW IT OUT.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.433
YOU THROW IT OUT.
I'VE BEEN CLEANING--
- NO, YOU GOT GLOVES.

21:32.467 --> 21:34.100
- I'VE BEEN
CLEANING THIS SHIT.
- YOU GOT GLOVES!

21:34.133 --> 21:37.233
- THROW IT OUT.
- AW, FUCK.

21:47.067 --> 21:50.233
HELLO, DAVIDAY.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.933
HELLO, LARRY.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

21:52.967 --> 21:55.933
GOOD TO SEE YOU, DAVIDAY.

21:55.967 --> 22:00.567
YOU KNOW,
I ATE THE LEFTOVERS

22:00.600 --> 22:02.800
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW

22:02.833 --> 22:04.633
I GOT SICK FROM THEM.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.400
NOW WHEN YOU SAY
THAT YOU GOT SICK,
DO YOU MEAN

22:06.433 --> 22:08.233
THAT THE ANIMAL GOT SICK
OR THAT YOU GOT SICK?

22:08.267 --> 22:10.100
- NO NO, I GOT SICK.
- YOU GOT SICK?

22:10.133 --> 22:13.367
YES, AND I'M JUST
KIND OF WONDERING

22:13.400 --> 22:14.367
IF THE FOOD

22:14.400 --> 22:18.200
PERHAPS WAS
TAMPERED WITH.

22:18.233 --> 22:20.633
WELL, IT MOST CERTAINLY
WAS NOT TAMPERED WITH.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.167
- REALLY?
- ABSOLUTELY.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.467
ARE YOU SURE?

22:24.500 --> 22:26.167
I'M VERY SURE.

22:41.567 --> 22:44.733
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
- LARRY, HOW CAN YOU
ACCUSE ME OF THAT?

22:44.767 --> 22:46.500
BECAUSE I WAS SICK.
I WAS RUNNING TO
THE BATHROOM ALL DAY.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.200
- ALL DAY?
- ALL DAY.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.333
- OH, REALLY? I SEE.
- REALLY. YEAH.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.367
AHA.
CHA CHA?

22:53.733 --> 22:54.967
COME HERE
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.733
LARRY DOESN'T FEEL WELL.
HE SAID THAT HIS BOWELS
ARE IRREGULAR.

23:01.767 --> 23:05.600
HOW MANY TIMES HAS LARRY
GONE TO THE BATHROOM TODAY?

23:05.633 --> 23:07.067
TWICE SO FAR,

23:07.067 --> 23:08.667
TWO MINUTES
EACH TIME.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.067
THANK YOU.

23:12.200 --> 23:15.800
LARRY, THAT DOES NOT SOUND
LIKE A MAN WHO'S SICK AT ALL.

23:30.167 --> 23:33.167
- ( punches and grunts on TV )
- ( chattering )

23:33.200 --> 23:34.967
WHAT'S UP, L.D.?

23:35.067 --> 23:37.733
UM...

23:37.767 --> 23:40.567
I'M JUST GONNA
USE THE BATHROOM.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
- Leon: WHAT?
- Loretta: HMM?

23:42.633 --> 23:45.800
BATHROOM.
I'M GONNA USE
THE BATHROOM.

24:16.067 --> 24:18.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THERE?

24:18.233 --> 24:21.700
THE TOILET WASN'T
WORKING PROPERLY.

24:21.733 --> 24:24.567
- SO YOU FIXED IT?
- I DID, ACTUALLY, YEAH.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.500
- OH, OKAY, GREAT.
- I HAD TO JUST
JIGGLE IT AROUND.

24:27.533 --> 24:28.967
OH, OKAY.
SO IT'S ALL--

24:29.067 --> 24:31.267
HEY, STAY HERE
FOR A SECOND.
NO NO, I JUST WANT TO SEE

24:31.300 --> 24:32.600
YOUR HANDIWORK.
HOLD ON.

24:32.633 --> 24:36.300
HEY, DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.200
OH, WAIT A SECOND.

24:38.233 --> 24:41.400
LARRY?

24:41.433 --> 24:43.767
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY MILLIONS
OF VIRGIN TREES

24:43.800 --> 24:45.700
ARE CUT DOWN TO MAKE
THIS TOILET PAPER,

24:45.733 --> 24:47.467
WHICH IS CONTRIBUTING
TO GLOBAL WARMING,

24:47.500 --> 24:50.100
WHICH IS CAUSING HURRICANES,
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE HERE?

24:50.133 --> 24:52.267
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT, LARRY?

24:52.300 --> 24:53.967
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I WAS TELLING THEM.
- THIS ISN'T THE KIND

24:54.067 --> 24:56.500
- OF TOILET PAPER
WE USE IN THIS HOUSE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.700
WE USE RECYCLED
POST-CONSUMER TOILET PAPER.

24:58.733 --> 25:03.167
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING-
- SO WHY DO WE HAVE TONS OF
TOILET PAPER IN THIS BATHROOM?

25:03.200 --> 25:05.967
AND WHY WERE YOU
IN THIS BATHROOM
USING THIS TOILET PAPER?

25:06.067 --> 25:09.200
AGAIN, THE TOILET
WAS BROKEN,

25:09.233 --> 25:10.633
BUT THEY ASKED ME--
THEY WERE VERY UNHAPPY--

25:10.667 --> 25:13.800
- WE ASKED YOU?
HOLD THERE, HOLD UP.
- ( all talking at once )

25:13.833 --> 25:15.833
YOU LIARS,
YOU WERE COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE TOILET PAPER.

25:15.867 --> 25:19.067
- HE WANTED ACCESS
TO OUR BATHROOM.
- AUNTIE RAE,

25:19.100 --> 25:21.933
DON'T BLAME THIS ON ME,
AUNTIE RAE.

25:21.967 --> 25:27.167
- ( doorbell rings )
- ( all continue overlapping)

25:27.200 --> 25:30.100
HEY, DAVID,
COME DOWN HERE, PERVO.

25:30.133 --> 25:32.233
COME DOWN HERE,
YOU FUCKING PERVO.

25:32.267 --> 25:34.967
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HOW DID YOU GET IN?

25:35.067 --> 25:36.400
THE FUCKING DOOR.
HOW ELSE DO YOU THINK
I GOT IN?

25:36.433 --> 25:38.567
THIS KID HAS GOT TO STOP
LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN, MAN.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.533
THIS IS IT.
IF I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE,

25:40.567 --> 25:42.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'D ATTACK YOU
RIGHT NOW.

25:42.367 --> 25:44.867
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU CALLED MY GIRLFRIEND

25:44.900 --> 25:46.733
AND HIT ON HER
AND SHE DOESN'T RESPOND

25:46.767 --> 25:50.333
- AND YOU FUCKING GET HER FIRED,
YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT.
- WHAT?

25:50.367 --> 25:52.167
FIRST OF ALL,
I NEVER HIT ON HER.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.067
- AND WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, "FIRED"?
- BURT'S DAD AT THE BARBERSHOP.

25:54.100 --> 25:57.233
YOU MADE THAT FUCKING
MISCARRIAGE REMARK.
SO HE FIRED HER

25:57.267 --> 25:59.833
BECAUSE HE WANTS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANYBODY THAT KNOWS YOU.

25:59.867 --> 26:01.833
OH, HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
GETTING BACK AT ME?

26:01.867 --> 26:03.833
WHO ARE YOU TO TELL HIM
HOW MANY KIDS TO HAVE?

26:03.867 --> 26:05.100
SHE'S GOT NINE KIDS.
COME ON, THAT'S PLENTY.

26:05.133 --> 26:07.133
- SHE WANTS MORE CHILDREN.
- HOW MANY DOES SHE NEED?

26:07.167 --> 26:08.567
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU,
THE MESSIAH, TO COUNT?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.933
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
BY THE WAY,

26:10.967 --> 26:12.400
IN CHINA
YOU'RE ALLOWED TWO.

26:12.433 --> 26:13.933
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE
KILLED IN CHINA.
- CHINA WHAT?

26:13.967 --> 26:15.633
TWO-- TWO BABIES IN CHINA.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.067
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU HAVE THREE?

26:17.067 --> 26:19.167
- THEY EXECUTE YOU.
- THEY KILL THE BABY?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.700
NOT THE BABY, IDIOT.
THEY KILL THE PARENTS.

26:21.733 --> 26:23.467
GET OUT OF HERE.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.900
WELL, MAYBE THEY DON'T EXECUTE,
BUT THEY GIVE YOU A GOOD
DRESSING-DOWN.

26:25.933 --> 26:28.200
HOW DARE YOU LOSE
MY GIRLFRIEND'S JOB?

26:28.233 --> 26:29.633
SHE LOST
HER HEALTH INSURANCE,

26:29.667 --> 26:31.267
SHE HAS NO SELF-WORTH
ANYMORE.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.967
- SHE LOST HER SELF-WORTH?
OH, REALLY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

26:34.067 --> 26:37.067
YOU GET ON THAT
GODDAMN TELEPHONE AND YOU
GET MY GIRLFRIEND'S JOB BACK.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.700
YOU CALL BURT
AND YOU APOLOGIZE.

26:38.733 --> 26:40.833
OKAY, I'LL MAKE THAT CALL
UNDER ONE CONDITION:

26:40.867 --> 26:42.667
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO USE YOUR BATHROOM

26:42.700 --> 26:45.300
- ON THE WAY TO WORK
IN THE MORNING.
- SIT ON MY TOILET?

26:45.333 --> 26:46.667
- YEAH.
- THERE'S NO FUCKING WAY.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.733
- WHY?
- NOBODY SITS
ON RICHARD LEWIS'S TOILET.

26:48.767 --> 26:51.200
- YOU USE EVERY
TOILET IN THE HOUSE?
- THAT'S RIGHT. I ROTATE.

26:51.233 --> 26:53.433
- I CAN'T USE THE BASEMENT?
- NO, THAT'S FOR WEEKENDS.

26:53.467 --> 26:54.667
I HAVE NO PLACE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.467
I CAN'T GO HERE,
I CAN'T GO AT WORK.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.767
YOU JUST MAKE
THE GODDAMN CALL.
YOU OWE ME.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.600
- JESUS CHRIST.
- I'LL TRY.

27:00.633 --> 27:01.733
- THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.
- YEAH, FINE.

27:01.767 --> 27:04.067
JUST GET HER
HER JOB BACK.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.333
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANT A RIGHTY CALL.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.067
WHAT'S THIS
LEFTY BULLSHIT?

27:13.067 --> 27:16.167
I WANT A RIGHTY CALL.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.500
JESUS CHRIST.

27:20.067 --> 27:21.833
- Hello?
- OH, HEY, BARBARA?

27:21.867 --> 27:23.333
- Yes.
- HEY, IT'S LARRY DAVID.

27:23.367 --> 27:25.767
OH, HI, LARRY.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.700
- ( shouts ) FUCK YOU!
- ( screaming )

27:35.067 --> 27:37.633
THE WOMAN'S OUT OF HER MIND,
SCREAMING IN MY EAR
LIKE THAT.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.800
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
FUCK.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.133
THANKS FOR TAKING ME,
BY THE WAY.

27:42.167 --> 27:45.367
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, MAN.
IT'S A BIG FAVOR I'M
DOING YOUR ASS, MAN.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.533
THERE'S THE BUILDING.
PULL OVER.

27:47.567 --> 27:50.333
ALL RIGHT.

27:50.367 --> 27:53.767
OKAY, PARK THE CAR
AND COME UP, OKAY?

27:53.800 --> 27:55.067
HIS NAME'S
DR. SCHAEFFER.

27:55.067 --> 27:58.067
DR. SCHAEFFER.
ALL RIGHT.

27:58.067 --> 28:01.067
( quiet jazz music
playing )

28:06.467 --> 28:07.633
