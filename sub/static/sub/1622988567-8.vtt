WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.047
I have type 1 narcolepsy with cataplexy.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.257
BENEDICT: Quite severely, I might add.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.426
Brought on by extremes,
mainly from a root of joy.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.510
A good joke.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.886
Okay.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.557
I can't remember where I am,
what my name is.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.183
MILLIGAN: Though,
I realize I'm clutching something.

00:17.267 --> 00:21.271
A small key,
fashioned from toenail clippings.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.857
Sticky! Kate still hasn't come back
to her room.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.027
KATE: Where did you even come from?

00:27.110 --> 00:29.195
Come to extract you and the others
from the island.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.488
What do you mean, he looked like me?

00:30.572 --> 00:32.574
-I would describe it as...
-Identical.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.534
Give me the exact location.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.424
NUMBER TWO: Prepare for landing.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.592
BENEDICT: Flight path perfect.

00:50.675 --> 00:51.593
NUMBER TWO: Adjusting pitch.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.095
RHONDA: Looking good.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.015
BENEDICT: Oh, no.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.523
NUMBER TWO: I think we're down.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.781
Are you enjoying the carving station?

01:13.573 --> 01:14.783
Vegan prime rib.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.202
It's very thoughtful.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.745
No, only the best.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.288
Now...

01:21.247 --> 01:22.332
Well...

01:22.999 --> 01:24.167
Big day.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.335
Agreed.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.296
I hope you know how much
I appreciate your work on this.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.008
And when the time comes,
I want you to step into the spotlight.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.010
I intend to share the stage.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.637
Well, proportionally.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.306
I don't need any kind of recognition.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.058
I mean, you've done amazing things.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.601
The world should know.

01:41.684 --> 01:45.605
Well, if there's one thing to trumpet...

01:45.688 --> 01:46.856
Yes, please.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.067
It's the geometrical progression
we've realized

01:49.150 --> 01:51.236
with signal amplification and efficiency.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.531
I don't need any kind of recognition,

01:54.614 --> 01:58.785
but if put to other uses,
the technology could truly help.

01:58.868 --> 01:59.994
It does help.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.913
We are helping.

02:02.622 --> 02:06.626
We have amplified our voice, haven't we?

02:08.753 --> 02:09.963
MARTINA: Dr. Curtain!

02:10.088 --> 02:11.339
Do you hear something?

02:14.509 --> 02:15.593
SECURITY: Stop her!

02:18.805 --> 02:19.639
Dr. Curtain!

02:19.722 --> 02:20.723
Martina?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.058
I'm innocent.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.309
What?

02:29.482 --> 02:30.817
What is that?

03:30.293 --> 03:33.546
How many times do I have to say
"it's go-time"?

03:33.630 --> 03:37.300
It is go-time. Tower raid. Now.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.469
Yes, Kate. We're going to raid the tower.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.678
Finally!

03:40.762 --> 03:42.889
The Improvement starts at 8:00.
After that...

03:42.972 --> 03:44.182
Goodbye, free will.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.601
Sticky, you're on Messenger duty, right?

03:46.684 --> 03:47.602
Yeah.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.897
You're the best at it, so he wants
to use you to start the Improvement.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.650
I just need to hold off the Whisperer
until you get there.

03:53.733 --> 03:54.943
To not give in.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.780
I can do that,
but can you guys destroy it?

03:58.863 --> 04:01.616
Hydrochloric acid. Eats through anything.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.327
Where are you going
to get hydrochloric acid?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.870
I'll get the acid.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.957
I won't be alone in the Whispering Room.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.541
Curtain will be there.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.961
We pour the acid on his feet.

04:13.628 --> 04:14.837
Hobble him.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.131
-Um...
-I can handle him.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.883
I've been doing some research.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.219
Curtain and Mr. Benedict are twins,

04:21.302 --> 04:23.930
so there's a good chance
that Curtain has narcolepsy, too.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.516
I have a way to get myself into the tower.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.228
After that, I make Curtain laugh,
he passes out,

04:30.311 --> 04:31.980
and Kate destroys the Whisperer.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.274
How are you gonna make him laugh?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.317
I'll tell him a joke.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.114
This is where the plan falls apart.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.159
I don't understand.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.705
You're not funny.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.416
I'm not?

04:52.292 --> 04:53.501
Sticky?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.170
CONSTANCE: Tell him this joke.

04:56.587 --> 04:59.507
A bowhunter accidentally shoots
his best friend...

04:59.590 --> 05:02.552
Guys. I got this. I can do it.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.804
REYNIE: This plan is...

05:04.887 --> 05:06.347
-Not a good plan.
-It's gonna fail.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.434
STICKY: Odds aren't great.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.444
SCIENTIST: We're all set.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.779
Ready to titrate.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.990
Okay.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.366
Good night.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.537
Titration, as much as I love it,
and I really do, I just adore it...

05:29.620 --> 05:32.915
Uh, I have to dine with my family.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.959
SCIENTIST:
They'll still be there when we finish.

05:35.043 --> 05:39.714
Oh, tomorrow. Titration tomorrow!

05:46.846 --> 05:48.556
-Isaac?

05:50.808 --> 05:51.726
Muldoon?

05:52.143 --> 05:53.353
It's so early.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.854
Martina needs you!

05:54.937 --> 05:55.980
She does?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.191
She needs to get off the island.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.234
She says you are the only one
who can help.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.071
-She said that? About me?
-Yeah.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.113
Where is she?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.365
There's a canoe.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.408
It's far, so you need to get going.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.411
And I need your key.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.913
My key?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.164
Why?

06:13.247 --> 06:15.666
She's been captured!
I have to break her out!

06:17.502 --> 06:20.088
Wait by the canoe.
Don't stop to talk to anyone!

06:22.590 --> 06:25.510
Ms. Crowe has been placed
in the Waiting Room.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.220
As for the other student,

06:27.303 --> 06:30.306
we are conducting a roving,
multi-point search...

06:30.390 --> 06:32.433
Does that just mean you've looked
in different places?

06:32.517 --> 06:36.312
-Yes, but with a strategy that maximize...
-Then just say that.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.233
You're a security professional, right?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.484
That is correct.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.861
Does it concern you
that we're experiencing these breaches

06:43.945 --> 06:45.988
so close to our launch of the Improvement?

06:46.072 --> 06:47.532
It is concerning, yes, sir.

06:47.615 --> 06:48.658
Yeah.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.369
Because you know what they say
about coincidences, don't you?

06:53.121 --> 06:57.208
It is one of the great shames of my life
that I'm not as well read...

06:57.291 --> 06:59.794
There's no such thing as coincidence.
Oh, my god.

06:59.877 --> 07:00.753
Okay.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.256
Someone has found us out.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.383
Sir.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.681
-So where's the acid?
-Pool shed.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.892
Hydrochloric acid is one of the chemicals
they use to clean pools.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.102
How do you know?

07:17.645 --> 07:18.729
Constance.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.731
These are the basics.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.316
You must know these things.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.360
I will learn.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.320
But only for you.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.867
But I want my own acid.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.702
For his feet.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.415
Okay. I trust you.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.795
-Kate Wetherall?
-Nope!

07:47.675 --> 07:48.843
Constance!

07:51.596 --> 07:54.140
We need to keep going south.
The dorm is over there.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.224
We're going the wrong way.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.686
All due respect, I was a ranked orienteer
back in university.

07:58.769 --> 07:59.979
Hard for me to acknowledge that

08:00.062 --> 08:03.399
when the governing body that determines
those rankings is notoriously corrupt.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.610
The NAFIO, corrupt?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.653
Big time. Snakes abound.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.738
Says who?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.156
Lot of people. People in the know.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.157
I sense jealousy.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.783
I'm simply stating that if we go...

08:12.867 --> 08:15.411
Stop! Please, stop.

08:17.538 --> 08:21.459
We're under an enormous amount of stress
and more than likely concussed.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.462
We must lay down
our individual concerns and fears.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.297
We are one entity now.

08:26.380 --> 08:30.176
A fearsome yet empathetic Cerberus,
charging forward with a singular goal,

08:30.259 --> 08:31.636
and that is to get the children.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.139
We got the children into this,
we must get them out.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.307
We cannot fail.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.309
Oh, we will not fail.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.813
I think we can all agree on that. Yes?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.233
Yeah.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.777
Thank you.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.494
Gorp?

08:59.413 --> 09:00.414
Thank you.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.041
Lead the way.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.085
South.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.095
You're needed for Whisperer duty.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.805
-Big day today.
-Big day today.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.223
That sounded cool.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.016
We should always say the same thing.

09:22.603 --> 09:23.688
I'm ready.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.748
Martina...

09:43.291 --> 09:44.292
Judas.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.340
You disrespected me.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.176
And you disrespected the game.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.929
MARTINA: Shame on you.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.247
CURTAIN: Do you see my dilemma?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.542
Two very different pieces of evidence.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.169
Pointing to...

10:33.758 --> 10:34.717
very...

10:43.684 --> 10:44.810
different...

10:48.189 --> 10:49.398
conclusions.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.200
What to think?

11:00.117 --> 11:04.121
What conclusions am I to make
about... this espionage?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.542
This betrayal?

11:11.712 --> 11:13.589
I'm open to suggestion.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.968
I did it.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.766
I copied her keycard
and broke into the Server Room.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.810
Martina had nothing to do with it.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.816
It's as I expected.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.029
Ms. Crowe, you're restored
to full rank and privilege.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.572
One mistake should not define you.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.617
Just choose your friends
more carefully next time.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.038
Kate...

11:46.122 --> 11:47.248
You may leave.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.044
KATE: I'm sorry.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.213
CURTAIN: Ms. Crowe?

12:05.015 --> 12:06.183
As for you...

12:09.687 --> 12:11.480
Prepare her for the Brainsweeper.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.065
-Oh, Ms. Wetherall.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.526
Check your bucket.

12:40.301 --> 12:46.307
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.516
-Yes.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.895
Yes?

12:52.563 --> 12:54.940
SECURITY: This man turned himself in.
He says he's...

12:55.024 --> 12:57.067
I'm the one you want.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.612
Fascinating.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.072
You look very familiar to me.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.493
Have we met before?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.455
I'm not good with faces.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.166
Oh.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.252
So you're the one I want.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.421
What exactly do I want you for?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.215
-Everything.
-Everything?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.636
Why so cryptic?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.972
Can no one execute a clear
and efficient statement? Is this...

13:27.056 --> 13:30.309
I work for your brother,
and we're trying to stop you.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.311
Ah...

13:34.021 --> 13:35.272
And there it is.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.067
Of course, he sent you.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.778
Please.

13:48.577 --> 13:52.122
So, why surrender? What's the play?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.290
Spare the girl.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.626
I'm the spy.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.336
You're talking about Ms. Wetherall.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.964
I'm afraid she has a date
with the Brainsweeper.

14:00.047 --> 14:00.965
Spare her...

14:01.715 --> 14:05.553
and I'll tell you when
and where Benedict is coming for you.

14:12.977 --> 14:13.936
All right.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.152
I'm going to need
to take you back a bit...

14:28.200 --> 14:29.368
Not a chance.

14:40.170 --> 14:44.633
It's a variation
on Hannibal's crossing of the Alps.

14:45.175 --> 14:48.053
Are you familiar
with the Second Punic War? Or...

14:50.347 --> 14:51.515
...elephants?

14:52.474 --> 14:53.642
I've heard of them.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.813
Ah, then, I'll skip
to Benedict's final approach,

14:57.897 --> 15:00.816
which involves quite a few moving parts...

15:01.025 --> 15:02.443
You're trying to stall me.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.197
You failed.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.452
As evidenced by...

15:13.579 --> 15:14.622
It's time.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.249
-See?
-

15:17.333 --> 15:19.793
I knew exactly how long it would take
to summon my Messenger,

15:19.877 --> 15:22.296
and that's exactly how long
I allowed you to drone on.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.383
But you've spun a wonderful tale
and kept me amused.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.222
You see...

15:33.557 --> 15:36.727
I can handle anything my brother
throws at me.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.397
Including the man
whose brain I swept years ago.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.151
I do remember you.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.948
A chemist with a conscience, yes?

15:50.407 --> 15:51.492
Oh.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.243
But you don't know that.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.246
Well...

15:57.206 --> 15:59.041
You won't remember
this much longer, either.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.961
Sweep him again, and the girl as well.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.672
-

16:20.562 --> 16:22.648
TECHNICIAN: We can start in just a moment.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.025
Well, Wetherall... it's been a good run.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.652
Overall, more ups than downs.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.363
You made some good friends...

17:12.948 --> 17:14.074
good memories.

17:17.911 --> 17:21.832
If I don't remember you after this,
it's been fun.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.210
Well, see you on the other side.

17:38.265 --> 17:42.144
I'm thinking,
"The Mysterious Constance Society."

17:43.187 --> 17:44.396
With Kate.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.648
I'll consider it.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
Thanks for coming back for me.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.865
You are a quality person.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.252
-Come on, Reynie...
-

18:15.344 --> 18:19.014
So... are you ready to make history?

18:28.148 --> 18:31.276
SECURITY: Groups Echo and Foxtrot,
meet at rally points ASAP.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.361
Copy that.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.373
Puna flamingo call?

18:44.456 --> 18:45.332
Chilean.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.667
Refined choice.

18:46.750 --> 18:52.005
You just astonish me, Number Two.
The Ivanov technique. Wow.

18:54.675 --> 18:55.676
Now...

19:01.974 --> 19:04.852
WHISPERER: Let's take a deep breath
to appreciate the occasion.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.898
We're going to try something new today.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.082
WHISPERER: Please repeat.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.918
Don't listen, but you must hear.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.422
Don't listen, but you must hear.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.437
WHISPERER: The first sequence is...

19:48.520 --> 19:54.651
Triplane. Pascal. Ferric. Pontoon.
Parliament. Perfectible.

19:55.068 --> 20:00.949
The first sequence is...
Triplane. Pascal. Ferris. Ponder.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.036
That's not quite correct, is it?

20:04.119 --> 20:06.163
Sorry. Nervous.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.250
Don't listen, but you can't hear.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.419
The first sequence is...

20:12.502 --> 20:16.298
Triplane. Pascal. Ferric.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.510
Pontoon. Parliament. Perfectible.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.180
Is something wrong, Sticky?

20:26.725 --> 20:28.560
No, everything's good.

20:30.687 --> 20:31.730
Is it?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.692
You're not... fighting the process,
are you?

20:36.193 --> 20:40.197
I'm just anxious.
I just... really want to do a good job.

20:44.952 --> 20:45.827
Pause!

20:50.958 --> 20:54.336
His impedance levels are sky-high.
He's saying the right words, but...

20:54.419 --> 20:56.255
He can't just say them, he has to commit.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.298
CURTAIN: He has to want it to work.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.716
Are you thinking...

20:59.800 --> 21:02.261
Get a back-up Messenger. Now.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.107
Careful.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.233
Very sharp.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.318
-How?
-Metal shop.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.417
Yes!

21:33.500 --> 21:38.046
I saw you again, today

21:44.011 --> 21:48.348
kisses for everyone

21:48.432 --> 21:50.058
JACKSON: The tower. Watch our way!

21:51.393 --> 21:54.021
JILLSON: Approaching the tower.
Repeat. We will advise.

22:01.611 --> 22:04.323
Constance, grab the anchor line!

22:04.406 --> 22:08.327
down, down on my knees

22:08.410 --> 22:09.494
JILLSON: Intruder!

22:09.786 --> 22:11.079
JACKSON: We're at the tower!

22:11.413 --> 22:12.748
We've got them!

22:13.540 --> 22:14.458
CONSTANCE: Whoa.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.721
-Now, you care to keep trying?
-

22:27.804 --> 22:31.141
That's your replacement,
but there's still time to send him back.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.811
CURTAIN: Reynie?

22:37.522 --> 22:38.607
Sticky!

22:40.067 --> 22:44.237
What are you doing?
What exactly is happening here?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.031
Where's Kate? Where's the acid?

22:46.114 --> 22:47.282
Acid?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.742
Oh, you're kidding me.

22:50.243 --> 22:56.249
Well, seems this conspiracy is vaster
and more diminutive than I thought.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.463
I have plans for you two,
but Sticky, back in the machine.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.262
-One hundred...
-Oh, no.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.890
One hundred drops of water
walk into a bar.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.518
The bartender says,
"We don't serve drops of water here,"

23:14.601 --> 23:15.852
and the drops of water say,

23:15.936 --> 23:18.230
"Can we just go in the back
and play pool?"

23:18.730 --> 23:19.773
What?

23:20.607 --> 23:23.193
One hundred pencils walk into a bar...

23:24.027 --> 23:25.028
Wait...

23:25.112 --> 23:26.321
What's happening?

23:26.738 --> 23:28.323
This is what we are reduced to.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.784
One hundred baby goats walk into a bar.

23:30.867 --> 23:33.370
The bartender says,
"We can't serve goats here,"

23:33.453 --> 23:34.621
and the goats say, "Why not?"

23:34.704 --> 23:37.290
And the bartender says,
"Because you're kids!"

23:40.627 --> 23:42.212
"Because you're kids!"

24:19.124 --> 24:20.584
Okay, that was a good one.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.965
I didn't know you had it in you.
I was always told you were devoid of wit.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.845
What? Did you expect something else?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.348
CURTAIN: Oh...

24:36.933 --> 24:39.728
You thought you could trigger
a narcoleptic seizure, didn't you?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.314
Aw...

24:43.023 --> 24:46.651
The narcolepsy I conquered years ago
through force of will?

24:47.444 --> 24:49.738
And I didn't have the same triggers
as my brother.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.450
They had nothing to do
with humor or emotion.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.744
Nothing at all.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.961
Security to the Whispering Room.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.215
-Code Red.
-SECURITY: Affirmative.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.508
ANNOUNCER:
All available security personnel...

25:09.591 --> 25:10.509
Oh, god.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.719
-...to the Whispering Gallery immediately.
-Where is it?

25:12.802 --> 25:14.304
Repeat, all available...

25:14.387 --> 25:15.889
You think this is the only way up to that?

25:15.972 --> 25:18.975
Yes. They'll be coming this way.
We can't let them in.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.810
-You go.
-No. We all go!

25:20.894 --> 25:22.896
The kids need you! We'll hold them here.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.440
Go!

25:26.900 --> 25:28.401
I won't disappoint you.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.114
-

25:40.163 --> 25:43.083
It has been the honor of my life
to serve with you.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.627
Mine as well.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.383
In many ways, I didn't understand you.
I pushed your friendship away.

25:51.841 --> 25:54.302
There are things, of course,
I'd have done differently.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.513
The responsibility is shared.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.015
That's very generous.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.937
I feel seen in this moment now.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.438
-Good.
-Hmm.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.732
I feel seen as well.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.362
Sometimes, it's hard for me
to take such positivity

26:12.445 --> 26:14.823
in a person at face value,
so I tend to sabotage...

26:14.906 --> 26:17.367
Okay. We are good now, yeah? Thanks.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.413
We're good.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.790
Stay back!

26:25.792 --> 26:27.794
JILLSON: This is so upsetting to me!

26:27.877 --> 26:28.795
It's offensive!

26:28.878 --> 26:31.089
You were given so many opportunities!

26:31.172 --> 26:32.799
Opportunities to shine!

26:37.971 --> 26:39.055
MILLIGAN: Hey!

26:54.613 --> 26:56.364
Mr. Washington, get in the Whisperer.

26:58.992 --> 26:59.951
I won't.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.667
Sticky, I can easily wait
for your replacement,

27:07.751 --> 27:09.794
but I want this for you.

27:11.004 --> 27:16.760
You have no idea how gifted you are,
and you deserve to be a part of this.

27:17.510 --> 27:21.598
Out of everyone here,
you, you are the one, Sticky.

27:21.681 --> 27:25.685
And I will always bet
on someone recognizing their destiny.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.854
-Dr. Curtain.
-No more humor.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.733
You don't really want to do this,
Dr. Curtain.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.486
Hmm.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.781
I expressly wanna do this.
I've been very clear.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.826
I don't think you are a bad person.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.039
I don't think I'm a bad person, either.
Who thinks that?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.375
I know there is good in there somewhere.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.044
-REYNIE: I know there's good in everyone.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.129
Okay, this is embarrassing.

27:53.213 --> 27:57.092
I've seen you with S.Q.
You care about your son.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.177
You have a sense of humor.

27:59.260 --> 28:00.512
You're really, really smart...

28:00.595 --> 28:01.930
All right, that's enough. That's enough.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.682
So why do you have to do all this?

28:04.099 --> 28:05.684
REYNIE: There's a good person in there.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.477
And it's not that person's fault

28:07.560 --> 28:12.107
that life is so hard and so unfair,
and so out of control.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.983
It's not your fault what happened to you.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.443
I said enough!

28:15.527 --> 28:18.113
I'm just saying that it's okay to be sad,

28:18.196 --> 28:20.281
but you can do it
without hurting other people.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.451
I'm not sad.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.247
-I'm not. I'm completely fine.
-No, you aren't.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.998
And if you realized that,

28:29.082 --> 28:31.376
you wouldn't need
to tell everybody what to do.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.961
And you could forgive.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.879
How dare you!

28:36.089 --> 28:37.841
You are a child!

28:37.924 --> 28:40.468
You have no idea what I've been through.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.596
You don't know me! You don't see me!

28:43.680 --> 28:49.477
I am not some weak, vulnerable,
damaged person in need of self-healing!

28:49.561 --> 28:51.646
-Or some...
-

29:06.786 --> 29:07.996
It's anger.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.581
His trigger is anger.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.919
No. It's being vulnerable.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.714
Being seen for who he is.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.259
It was a good strategy.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.552
I'm impressed.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.014
It wasn't a strategy.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.100
What now?

29:51.372 --> 29:54.083
This... is my friend.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.546
My best friend!
A person who believes in honor!

29:59.672 --> 30:02.592
And these are the best of the best!

30:02.675 --> 30:04.886
And they do what I say!

30:04.969 --> 30:06.679
-KID 1: Yeah!
-KID 2: Here for you, Martina!

30:12.727 --> 30:15.104
Your friends... They need you.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.453
Go, Katie Cat!

30:36.376 --> 30:37.752
KATE: I remember how his arms felt...

30:39.754 --> 30:41.548
lifting me out of the water.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.112
Kate!

31:06.739 --> 31:07.740
Where's the acid?

31:08.950 --> 31:10.201
There's no acid.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.287
We need the acid!

31:12.370 --> 31:14.706
It was a Hail Mary, guys.
Poorly thought out.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.709
He's gonna wake up any second.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.335
REYNIE: And he called for help.

31:24.215 --> 31:27.635
In many ways,
this was coming from the start.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.062
What are you doing?

31:41.107 --> 31:42.609
REYNIE: Constance, don't!

31:46.696 --> 31:50.158
All that is left is to break its will.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.535
It's a machine.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.996
Then it will be more difficult.

31:56.414 --> 31:57.916
Press the button.

32:18.645 --> 32:19.979
WHISPERER: Well, hello.

32:20.563 --> 32:23.483
This has all been a bit stressful,
wouldn't you say?

32:25.068 --> 32:26.319
What's your name?

32:27.153 --> 32:28.279
Contraire.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.114
WHISPERER: Wouldn't you like to begin?

32:30.448 --> 32:33.034
We have something so important to share!

32:33.785 --> 32:35.662
What is your favorite color?

32:36.079 --> 32:37.205
No.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.666
WHISPERER: That's not a color.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.085
No is a color.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.798
WHISPERER: Imagine yourself
on a cool autumn day...

32:47.423 --> 32:48.675
Unimaginable.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.218
No.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.929
WHISPERER:
Let's begin with the first sequence.

32:53.012 --> 32:54.472
Please repeat.

32:54.889 --> 32:56.933
Don't listen but hear.

32:57.475 --> 33:02.605
The first sequence is...
Triplane. Pascal. Ferric.

33:08.152 --> 33:10.613
I can't hear you. You'll have to speak up.

33:13.032 --> 33:14.867
You can hear me.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.161
WHISPERER: But you're not speaking.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.252
Got it?

33:25.753 --> 33:26.838
WHISPERER: Oh.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.967
Have you ever wanted
to be part of something?

33:32.844 --> 33:35.304
What are you afraid of?

33:37.557 --> 33:41.811
No need for... hostility.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.521
Is she okay?

33:44.647 --> 33:46.566
WHISPERER: Disagreeable.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.234
Yes!

33:49.277 --> 33:51.988
WHISPERER: Insubor...

33:52.071 --> 33:53.448
Yes!

33:57.368 --> 34:01.247
WHISPERER: Why can't you just go along?

34:01.330 --> 34:02.665
CONSTANCE: Never!

34:03.374 --> 34:07.170
WHISPERER: Why can't you just go...

34:08.254 --> 34:09.964
Go...

34:23.853 --> 34:25.229
KATE: She did it.

34:27.106 --> 34:28.107
So...

34:35.073 --> 34:36.783
Oh, my. Oh, my.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.454
Oh, I know.

34:45.416 --> 34:48.044
I'm so happy to see you. So happy.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.506
I can only imagine
what you've been through.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.343
First things first.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.638
All right. Uh...

35:05.603 --> 35:07.563
BENEDICT: This is Curtain. Stand down.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.149
Stand down. The Emergency is over.

35:10.691 --> 35:11.776
Stand down.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.029
I repeat. Stand down.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.538
-Standing down.
-

35:34.382 --> 35:35.424
How was that?

35:38.219 --> 35:39.971
I tried so hard to get here,

35:40.054 --> 35:42.640
but I knew it wouldn't be
about me getting here in time.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.725
I knew it was you who would save us.

35:45.226 --> 35:48.104
Not the adults. Not me. You.

35:49.021 --> 35:50.857
We are so lucky to have found you.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.609
Number Two and Rhonda
should just be just moments away.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.194
Please go. You've done your part.

35:56.445 --> 35:59.073
Are you sure you're okay? We could stay.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.408
For the reckoning.

36:02.827 --> 36:03.911
I will be okay.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.665
This is my part.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.877
Now, go, go, go.

36:18.634 --> 36:19.886
Um...

36:46.204 --> 36:48.497
-How could you even walk in here after...
-How could you do this to children?

36:48.581 --> 36:49.957
-...all this time as though you are right.
-I mean not just the moral implications...

36:50.041 --> 36:51.167
-Mister Good, who will set everything...
-...but the recklessness over such...

36:51.250 --> 36:52.627
-...who will set everything straight...
-...a period of time. Did you think...

36:52.710 --> 36:54.212
-...for his misguided brother...
-...for a second where this was headed?

36:54.295 --> 36:55.463
-...not taking one minute...
-Or where it might take us...

36:55.546 --> 36:56.839
-...to consider...
-...or were you so myopic that...

37:10.269 --> 37:12.480
That little girl is psychic, isn't she?

37:12.563 --> 37:13.564
Perhaps.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.358
I should have anticipated that.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.737
Why didn't you try to reach me?

37:20.154 --> 37:21.280
I did.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.575
Attempting to kidnap me
is not trying to reach me.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.829
So what do you want?

37:28.913 --> 37:29.997
To gloat, I assume?

37:31.123 --> 37:32.250
What?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.047
Why would you say that?

37:39.006 --> 37:41.300
Did you really think I came here to gloat?

37:42.134 --> 37:44.553
Are you that deeply damaged that...

37:46.681 --> 37:48.432
I was actually happy to see you.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.061
Despite everything.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.026
I want to acknowledge my part in this.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.154
The hurt you suffered
because I failed to help.

38:02.822 --> 38:03.990
Oh, really?

38:04.991 --> 38:07.201
I'm not here to judge you, Nathaniel.

38:07.868 --> 38:11.247
Oh. Thank you for that.
That's so kind and generous of you.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.708
I'm here to reclaim you! To reclaim us!

38:13.791 --> 38:14.959
We're brothers.

38:15.042 --> 38:17.336
We were so close, once.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.587
I disappointed you...

38:18.671 --> 38:21.507
To say the least. To say the very least!

38:21.590 --> 38:22.550
Yes.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.676
I didn't come back for you,

38:23.759 --> 38:26.387
but that was partly
because I needed freedom!

38:26.470 --> 38:28.514
You always wanted to control!

38:28.597 --> 38:31.642
To control me. To control your friends.
To control everyone!

38:31.726 --> 38:33.602
And controlling people is wrong!

38:33.686 --> 38:34.812
Oh, really?

38:35.354 --> 38:36.731
Well, I need to write that down.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.201
CURTAIN: It's just like Tommy Jacobs.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.580
What?

38:53.372 --> 38:54.498
Tommy Jacobs.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.667
You remember him.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.046
From the orphanage?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.048
Of course.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.051
Well, then you remember
he was a disaster at dancing. Right?

39:05.134 --> 39:06.260
Hopeless.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.512
And I remember, one year,

39:08.596 --> 39:13.184
when we were preparing for the pageant
and Tommy was just... Ooh.

39:13.267 --> 39:16.937
Desperately clumsy, absolutely no rhythm.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.398
But do you remember what I said to you?

39:19.940 --> 39:21.108
Hmm?

39:22.693 --> 39:24.070
To stay away from him.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.738
To stay away from him.

39:26.322 --> 39:30.451
I was literally terrified
he would infect us with his incompetence.

39:31.118 --> 39:34.997
But you said,
"Why can't you just see the best in him?

39:35.081 --> 39:36.582
Why do you have to judge him?"

39:36.957 --> 39:41.295
And I watched how you encouraged him
and how hard he worked to get better.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.965
Of course, I thought,
"Why are you wasting your time?"

39:47.885 --> 39:49.428
But you believed in him.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.640
And that belief built in Tommy Jacobs.

39:53.140 --> 39:57.937
And when that pageant came around,
he stepped on that stage with a smile.

40:00.606 --> 40:03.192
And delivered the worst performance
in recorded history.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.461
Mr. Benedict? Mr. Benedict.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.546
Yes?

40:24.547 --> 40:25.464
Yes?

40:25.923 --> 40:27.633
What is that noise?

40:27.716 --> 40:29.718
Oh, no. Oh, no.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.100
REYNIE: Sorry, Mr. Benedict.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.644
BENEDICT: We do the best we can.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.357
And sometimes, it's good enough.

40:43.441 --> 40:47.987
for the sunshine in the sky

40:48.070 --> 40:52.283
why I'm feeling so high

40:52.366 --> 40:55.661
Do you feel that?
A weight has been lifted.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.833
The Emergency is gone.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.753
And it's you who have done it.

41:06.088 --> 41:09.758
The Helpers are returning to normal.
To their family and friends.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.637
To life as it was.

41:18.684 --> 41:23.022
like a bird on a wing

41:23.105 --> 41:27.568
to all living things

41:29.195 --> 41:30.321
It's good to be home.

41:30.404 --> 41:33.824
that's the reason

41:50.841 --> 41:51.884
She likes you.

41:51.967 --> 41:55.429
As much as an inscrutable being
can be said to feel anything.

42:17.826 --> 42:21.664
I understand that you were
a circus performer?

42:22.581 --> 42:23.916
Oh, yeah.

42:25.084 --> 42:27.127
I thought I might get back to it someday.

42:28.587 --> 42:29.964
Maybe I've outgrown it.

42:30.422 --> 42:33.509
Lots of great people,
but it gets kind of political,

42:33.801 --> 42:36.637
acrobats versus clowns,
me stuck in between...

42:40.933 --> 42:42.601
What does it feel like?

42:43.686 --> 42:45.062
Having no memory.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.485
It felt like... searching.

42:53.904 --> 42:57.866
Always searching for a word, or...

42:58.242 --> 43:01.036
or the answer to a riddle
that was right in front of me,

43:01.120 --> 43:02.788
but just out of reach.

43:04.790 --> 43:06.333
Do you know that feeling?

43:10.963 --> 43:12.673
I couldn't give up, though.

43:17.261 --> 43:21.557
Because I knew that
what I was looking for was special.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.351
Incredibly special.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.730
I just couldn't put a name to it.

43:31.233 --> 43:32.860
It was you, Kate.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.782
It was always you.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.791
And now, I...

43:48.959 --> 43:50.669
I'm remembering more.

43:51.378 --> 43:52.588
Bit by bit.

43:52.921 --> 43:54.298
Interesting things.

43:54.381 --> 43:59.053
I seem to know
an incredible amount of trivia

43:59.136 --> 44:00.804
about the building of the...

44:04.266 --> 44:06.226
Transcontinental railroad.

44:20.616 --> 44:21.659
MS. PERUMAL: Reynie.

44:24.411 --> 44:25.537
Hi.

44:27.706 --> 44:29.208
I missed you.

44:31.919 --> 44:34.630
I am so proud of you.

44:36.757 --> 44:40.010
I wrote you letters. In my head.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.136
You did?

44:43.722 --> 44:47.351
-What is it?
-I wondered if...

44:48.686 --> 44:50.354
You can ask me anything.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.941
I want to come live with you.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.194
I've been thinking about that, too.

45:01.448 --> 45:06.078
There's always a reason
not to do something that's... so big.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.874
But sometimes,
you realize that you just can.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.169
That you do have room.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.721
Have you given any thought
to your continued studies?

45:23.804 --> 45:25.514
I have spoken to my aunt...

45:25.597 --> 45:27.433
Oh, you have? How was that?

45:28.016 --> 45:29.143
It was fine.

45:29.226 --> 45:30.644
I think we understood each other.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.438
Oh, good, good.

45:32.521 --> 45:34.898
So, what do you want to do?

45:35.232 --> 45:36.984
You know you're more than welcome here.

45:37.359 --> 45:40.863
Thank you, but I was hoping
to go to the Boatwright Academy.

45:41.196 --> 45:42.698
Of course.

45:43.323 --> 45:45.284
You richly deserve that.

45:45.659 --> 45:46.744
It's the best.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.412
I've heard the science lab is...

45:48.495 --> 45:49.830
Amazing.

45:49.913 --> 45:51.999
-You'll be valued there.
-

45:52.082 --> 45:53.876
And we'll do everything
in our power to help.

45:53.959 --> 45:54.918
Yes?

45:58.422 --> 45:59.548
Now...

46:04.762 --> 46:09.683
The idea of family is one
that should be expansive,

46:09.767 --> 46:11.268
and not reductive.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.188
So, for that reason...

46:14.271 --> 46:16.106
I see where this is going.

46:16.482 --> 46:20.360
Constance, I have made arrangements...

46:20.444 --> 46:21.904
Respectfully decline.

46:23.113 --> 46:24.281
Decline?

46:25.073 --> 46:26.158
The adoption.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.244
Oh.

46:29.745 --> 46:33.582
I will stay here,
but let's not paper this.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.212
Of course. Of course.

46:47.846 --> 46:50.140
Don't worry. Just a short vacation.

46:50.432 --> 46:51.975
You'll all be fine without me.

46:54.978 --> 46:56.480
This is good.

46:56.980 --> 46:59.358
We will. Where are you going?

46:59.441 --> 47:01.944
I'm just going to indulge my passion
for airshows.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.195
Season's beginning...

47:03.278 --> 47:07.032
Oh, I know. Sao Paolo World of Wings
starts this week.

47:07.115 --> 47:08.158
You like airshows?

47:08.242 --> 47:09.409
Love a good airshow.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.954
And honestly, which of them aren't good?

47:17.584 --> 47:21.213
I could delay my departure a day,
if you have interest...

47:21.296 --> 47:23.799
-I do!
-It's an exacting itinerary.

47:23.882 --> 47:25.509
Ooh. Sounds exciting!

47:25.592 --> 47:27.010
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

47:27.719 --> 47:29.346
I can pack in two seconds.

47:29.972 --> 47:31.390
What are you going to do?

47:32.099 --> 47:33.350
I'm going to find him.

47:33.684 --> 47:34.977
I won't give up on him.

47:35.561 --> 47:36.687
That is my mission.

47:36.770 --> 47:41.275
But for now, the most important thing
is to live in the moment.

47:41.358 --> 47:42.359
Oh...

47:43.068 --> 47:44.611
Having us all together.

47:46.196 --> 47:50.325
Let's just live in this moment
for as long as we can, shall we?

47:52.244 --> 47:54.079
CURTAIN: Disgrace and exile.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.373
Perfect.

47:57.624 --> 47:58.959
It's going to be okay.

48:01.128 --> 48:02.462
No, S.Q.

48:03.839 --> 48:05.841
Life has equipped you for disappointment.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.553
And I mean that as a sincere compliment.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.556
MAN: Are you sure
I can't stow your baggage?

48:12.639 --> 48:13.807
It might get a bit choppy.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.392
No, don't touch them.

48:19.730 --> 48:21.523
I suggest you let him take it.

48:23.442 --> 48:24.568
Really?

48:27.237 --> 48:28.989
Whisperer is just a souvenir.

48:31.033 --> 48:32.576
Well, that's consoling.

48:33.452 --> 48:34.912
I've got something better.

48:52.721 --> 48:54.598
-Is this...
-DR. GARRISON: Yes.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.314
Well, this could be interesting.
