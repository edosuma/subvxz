she dumped you again.

- Okay.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.280

04:40.321 --> 04:43.867

off the car.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.623

Now, I don't know

06:34.019 --> 06:35.562

06:35.603 --> 06:37.356
or what to do

06:35.603 --> 06:37.356
with my life.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.481
That's okay, Deej.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.067
take a negative

06:40.108 --> 06:41.193
and, and turn it

06:40.108 --> 06:41.193
into a positive.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.652
You know, you,

06:41.235 --> 06:42.652

06:49.034 --> 06:51.078
seize the day.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.248
You know, I say, pick a road

06:51.119 --> 06:54.248
and ease on down it, you know?

06:54.289 --> 06:55.916
I mean, if you want to go

06:54.289 --> 06:55.916
to Berkeley, go to Berkeley.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.125
If you want to go

06:55.957 --> 06:57.125
to another college

06:57.167 --> 06:58.543
you can go

06:57.167 --> 06:58.543
to another college.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.878
If you wanna,

06:58.585 --> 06:59.878
you wanna jump a steamer

06:59.920 --> 07:01.088
and travel

06:59.920 --> 07:01.088
around the world, I say

07:01.129 --> 07:03.715
"Hey, babe, go for it."

07:03.757 --> 07:07.969
Or you can marry Nelson and

07:03.757 --> 07:07.969
have him pay for all that stuff.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.428
Yeah, well,

07:08.011 --> 07:09.428
the way I feel right now

07:09.470 --> 07:12.224
that doesn't sound

07:09.470 --> 07:12.224
half-bad.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.018
I wish I had somebody

07:12.266 --> 07:15.018
like Nelson to fall back on.

07:15.060 --> 07:19.439
Ah, but you have

07:15.060 --> 07:19.439
Mr. Personality.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.108
Yeah, that's all

07:19.480 --> 07:21.108
I have.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.152
A man with a plunger

07:21.149 --> 07:24.152
and wet socks.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.905
Pretty soon, I won't even

07:24.194 --> 07:26.905
have my best friend.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.489
What are you

07:26.947 --> 07:28.489
talking about?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.367
Come on, Deej,

07:28.531 --> 07:30.367
you know you're gonna

07:30.409 --> 07:31.952
go to college somewhere.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.536
You'll meet some

07:31.993 --> 07:33.536
new, smart friends

07:33.578 --> 07:35.163
and forget all about me.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.706
Let's face it.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.334
Life together,

07:36.748 --> 07:39.334
as we know it, is over.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.340
That's gotta brighten

07:42.670 --> 07:45.340
your day a little.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.771
Comet, stop staring at me.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.357
I'm not going

07:59.813 --> 08:02.357
to drop the sandwich.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.651
[whining]

08:04.692 --> 08:07.737
Comet, stop begging.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.737
You're worse than Joey.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.072
[whining]

08:09.114 --> 08:10.449
Alright.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.783
Oops.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.369
[knocking]

08:14.411 --> 08:15.662
Come in.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.038
Hey, Deej.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.498
I just brought a book

08:17.080 --> 08:18.498
over for Joey

08:18.539 --> 08:20.167
on what to do

08:18.539 --> 08:20.167
when you meet the queen.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.377
Oh, really?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.377
What's it called?

08:22.419 --> 08:25.088
"What To Do When

08:22.419 --> 08:25.088
You Meet The Queen."

08:26.798 --> 08:28.133
Is Joey here?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.051
No. The whole family

08:28.175 --> 08:30.051
went to the mall.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.054
I just wanted to stay home

08:30.093 --> 08:33.054
and think about school.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.015
Are you still

08:33.096 --> 08:35.015
feeling bad?

08:35.056 --> 08:36.599
Well, I'm-I'm

08:35.056 --> 08:36.599
feeling better.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.019
My Uncle Jesse was right.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.019
I do have options.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.645
And Berkeley's

08:39.060 --> 08:40.645
a great school

08:40.687 --> 08:43.315
and, uh, there's others

08:40.687 --> 08:43.315
I haven't heard from yet.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.233
So, I'm moving

08:43.357 --> 08:45.233
out of depressed

08:45.275 --> 08:49.863
and I'm well on my way

08:45.275 --> 08:49.863
to slightly bummed.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.615
Well, I have something that'll

08:49.904 --> 08:52.615
take you past slightly bummed

08:52.657 --> 08:55.327
through okey-dokey

08:52.657 --> 08:55.327
all the way to perky.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.539
Remember you were

08:57.037 --> 08:59.539
worried about what to wear

08:59.580 --> 09:02.125
when you meet the queen?

09:03.710 --> 09:05.462
'Nelson.'

09:05.504 --> 09:06.796
Diamond earrings for me?

09:06.838 --> 09:08.089
You shouldn't have.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.551
Well, I didn't.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.551
Those are just a loan.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.262
You dumped me,

09:11.592 --> 09:14.262
remember?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.015
Well, at least

09:15.263 --> 09:17.015
for one night

09:17.057 --> 09:20.519
I'll have earlobes

09:17.057 --> 09:20.519
of the rich and famous.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.688
Oh, um,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.688
just, okay.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.440
[ringing]

09:25.482 --> 09:26.691
- Hello.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.691
- 'Deej.'

09:26.733 --> 09:28.902
I'm about to become

09:26.733 --> 09:28.902
a blushing bride

09:28.943 --> 09:32.406
or as Duane says,

09:28.943 --> 09:32.406
"A flushing bride."

09:32.447 --> 09:34.074
Kimmy, there, there,

09:32.447 --> 09:34.074
must be a bad connection.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.867
I could have sworn

09:34.115 --> 09:35.867
you said "Bride."

09:35.909 --> 09:38.036
You heard right,

09:35.909 --> 09:38.036
bachelorette number one.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.329
I asked Duaney-poo

09:38.078 --> 09:39.329
to marry me

09:39.371 --> 09:40.788
and he said yes.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.376
Well, actually,

09:40.830 --> 09:44.376
he said, "Whatever"

09:44.418 --> 09:46.169
but here we are

09:44.418 --> 09:46.169
at the "Create Your Own Wedding"

09:46.211 --> 09:47.337
chapel in Reno.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.547
Cool, huh?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.881
Kimmy, what are you doing?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.259
- You don't love Duane.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.259
- I know.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.635
- Wish me luck.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.635
- 'Kimmy, wait.'

09:54.677 --> 09:57.638
Um, w-we promised

09:54.677 --> 09:57.638
that i-if we ever got married

09:57.680 --> 10:00.141
we'd be each other's

09:57.680 --> 10:00.141
bridesmaid, remember?

10:00.183 --> 10:02.894
Well, yeah. That's true,

10:00.183 --> 10:02.894
but you're there and I'm here.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.229
'Well, I'll be there, okay?'

10:04.271 --> 10:06.189
'Just don't do anything

10:04.271 --> 10:06.189
until I get there.'

10:06.231 --> 10:07.690
Oh, hey,

10:06.231 --> 10:07.690
that works out Great.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.693
If I don't use their bridesmaid,

10:07.732 --> 10:10.693
I'll save 12 bucks.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.281
Kimmy's getting married.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.615
To what?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.160
She's making

10:17.576 --> 10:19.160
a terrible mistake.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.871
I-I have to find out when

10:19.202 --> 10:21.871
the first plane leaves to Reno.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.290
15 minutes.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.458
What, you memorized

10:23.331 --> 10:24.458
the schedule?

10:24.499 --> 10:25.584
No, we'll take my plane.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.877
It leaves

10:25.625 --> 10:27.877
when I tell her to.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.130
Great, uh, but I just have

10:27.919 --> 10:30.130
to write my family a note.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.757
- Okay.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.757
- Um..

10:34.301 --> 10:35.760
Let's see..

10:35.802 --> 10:40.474
"Kimmy's getting married.

10:40.515 --> 10:45.979
Went to Reno with Nelson.

10:40.515 --> 10:45.979
Love, DJ"

10:46.020 --> 10:47.021
Perfect.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.648
Oh, gosh,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.648
I-I smudged it all up

10:48.689 --> 10:49.983
'cause of that grease

10:48.689 --> 10:49.983
from the sandwich.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.692
No, no, that's fine.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.692
This is an emergency.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.278
Neatness doesn't count.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.278
I got hot towels in the limo.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.446
- Let's go.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.446
- Great.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.073
We've got to stop

10:54.488 --> 10:57.073
that wedding.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.221
What are you, honey,

11:16.759 --> 11:20.221
you're doing it the wrong way.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.599
Okay, guys,

11:20.263 --> 11:22.599
how do I look?

11:22.641 --> 11:25.519
And be brutal.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.396
Now, I know why

11:25.560 --> 11:28.396
they call it a monkey suit.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.689
Don't listen to him, Joey.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.689
You look very dashing.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.526
Oh, I wish

11:30.731 --> 11:32.526
I felt dashing.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.362
I'm so nervous about making a

11:32.567 --> 11:35.362
mistake when I meet the Queen.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.405
Joey, don't worry

11:35.403 --> 11:37.405
about a thing.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.991
When you meet the Queen, all you

11:37.447 --> 11:39.991
have to do is just stand there.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.243
You're not from England,

11:40.033 --> 11:42.243
so, you don't have to bow

11:42.285 --> 11:45.288
oh, and don't speak

11:42.285 --> 11:45.288
unless you're spoken to.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.874
You've been meeting queens

11:45.330 --> 11:47.874
and not telling me?

11:47.915 --> 11:50.293
No, I read this book.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.293
I found it on the table.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.295
Nelson must have

11:50.335 --> 11:52.295
brought it over.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.631
"To Nelson.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.631
Love, the Queen.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.258
PS, thanks for the loan."

11:57.300 --> 12:01.388
- It doesn't say that.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.388
- Right there.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.348
Joey, could you get a picture

12:01.429 --> 12:03.348
of the Queen for me?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.058
It's for

12:03.390 --> 12:05.058
my collection.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.726
When did you start collecting

12:05.099 --> 12:07.726
pictures of the Queen?

12:07.768 --> 12:10.938
As soon as you

12:07.768 --> 12:10.938
push this button.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.232
Well, I'll give

12:10.980 --> 12:12.232
it a shot.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.901
Wish me luck.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.901
I'm off to meet the Queen.

12:14.942 --> 12:18.572
Pip pip, cheerios,

12:14.942 --> 12:18.572
Cap'n Crunch.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.240
Trix are for kids.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.618
I'm cuckoo

12:20.281 --> 12:23.618
for cocoa puffs.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.329
Why do I feel like

12:23.660 --> 12:26.329
the Queen needs the luck?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.957
Michelle, I think

12:27.622 --> 12:29.957
you'd better feed Comet.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.836
He was licking the TV

12:29.999 --> 12:33.836
during an Alpo commercial.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.171
He probably got

12:33.878 --> 12:35.171
that from Joey.

12:35.213 --> 12:38.383
He does the same thing

12:35.213 --> 12:38.383
during "Baywatch."

12:38.425 --> 12:40.176
Come on, Comet.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.176
I'll get you dinner.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.887
We can watch it

12:40.218 --> 12:42.887
make its own gravy.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.518
Oh, hey.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.518
A present for me.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.852
Oh, it's empty.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.606
Here, Aunt Becky.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.606
It's for you.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.567
Dad, I found this

12:52.647 --> 12:55.567
in Comet's dish.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.069
I think someone

12:55.609 --> 12:58.069
sent him a letter.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.113
It's all smudged

12:58.111 --> 13:00.113
and chewed up.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.533
Um, "Getting married.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.243
"Reno..

13:05.285 --> 13:07.245
"...Nelson..

13:07.287 --> 13:09.122
...love, DJ"

13:09.163 --> 13:10.749
- It can't be.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.749
- Yeah, I know.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.752
Why would Janet Reno

13:10.789 --> 13:13.752
marry Willie Nelson?

13:15.629 --> 13:18.089
Well, that's

13:15.629 --> 13:18.089
one explanation.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.466
But it sounds to me

13:18.131 --> 13:19.466
like DJ went to Reno

13:19.507 --> 13:21.050
to marry Nelson.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.344
That-That makes even less sense

13:21.092 --> 13:23.344
than what I just said.

13:23.386 --> 13:26.222
Yeah, yeah, that-that doesn't

13:23.386 --> 13:26.222
make any sense at all.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.726
I-I wouldn't worry

13:26.264 --> 13:29.726
if I were you.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.394
You don't think she

13:29.768 --> 13:31.394
took us seriously, do you?

13:31.436 --> 13:32.646
What, what seriously? What?

13:32.687 --> 13:33.938
- Oh, nothing.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.938
- What?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.273
- Nothing.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.273
- What?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.566
- Nothing.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.566
- What!

13:36.608 --> 13:37.776
I just told her

13:36.608 --> 13:37.776
that she had a-a

13:37.816 --> 13:40.861
a plethora of opportunities

13:37.816 --> 13:40.861
out there.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.573
She's the one who told her

13:40.903 --> 13:43.573
to marry Nelson.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.284
Well, who knew that after 13

13:43.615 --> 13:46.284
years of not listening to me

13:46.326 --> 13:47.494
she'd start now?

13:47.535 --> 13:49.287
Oh, come on,

13:47.535 --> 13:49.287
I knew DJ was upset

13:49.329 --> 13:50.538
about the Stanford rejection

13:50.580 --> 13:51.998
but running off

13:50.580 --> 13:51.998
and getting married?

13:52.039 --> 13:53.750
Well, that explains

13:52.039 --> 13:53.750
this empty jewelry box.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.002
It was

13:53.792 --> 13:56.002
for an engagement ring.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.797
Ooh, I wonder

13:56.043 --> 13:58.797
how many carats.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.010
I mean,

14:01.424 --> 14:04.010
this is terrible.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.638
Guys, this is some kind

14:04.051 --> 14:06.638
of joke, right?

14:08.556 --> 14:10.016
Oh, come on.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.726
She's probably right outside

14:10.057 --> 14:11.726
that door right now.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.312
And she's just gonna pop her

14:11.768 --> 14:14.312
head in and yell "Gotcha."

14:14.354 --> 14:17.524
Honey, I know

14:14.354 --> 14:17.524
you're out there.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.692
Okay, Come on in.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.861
Joke's over,

14:18.733 --> 14:21.861
little Miss Hijinks.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.363
Should we take your car

14:21.902 --> 14:23.363
to the airport or mine?

14:23.404 --> 14:24.947
Let's take yours,

14:23.404 --> 14:24.947
they say you shouldn't drive

14:24.989 --> 14:27.575
during

14:24.989 --> 14:27.575
a nervous breakdown.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.952
[instrumental music]

14:35.583 --> 14:37.335
Hmm, Shepherd's pie

14:37.377 --> 14:38.586
Yorkshire pudding.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.840
My guess is you people

14:38.628 --> 14:41.840
don't like dogs.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.133
Well, I wonder where

14:41.881 --> 14:44.133
Cousin Nelson is.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.510
I'd like to thank him

14:45.552 --> 14:47.637
for bringing us

14:45.552 --> 14:47.637
together.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.597
Well, he probably got wind

14:47.679 --> 14:49.597
of the bow-wow buffet

14:49.639 --> 14:52.266
and stopped off

14:49.639 --> 14:52.266
and got a burrito.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.018
Well, shall we?

14:54.060 --> 14:56.145
Oh, look. There's one of those

14:54.060 --> 14:56.145
Buckingham palace guards.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.189
I heard you can do anything to

14:56.187 --> 14:58.189
these guys and they never move.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.482
You know, Joey,

14:58.231 --> 14:59.482
let's not do anything

14:59.524 --> 15:01.526
to embarrass ourselves

14:59.524 --> 15:01.526
or our dates.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.195
Oh, this'll be fun.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.195
Here. Watch.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.740
Sufferin' succotash.

15:06.781 --> 15:10.326
You, sir,

15:06.781 --> 15:10.326
are inscrutable.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.163
Boy, you guys

15:12.662 --> 15:14.163
are amazing.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.540
Nothing gets to these guys.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.296
- 'Her Majesty. The Queen.'

15:19.085 --> 15:22.296
- Joey, her Majesty's coming.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.673
Oh.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.139
Nice to meet you.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.139
Oops, I'm sorry.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.808
I wasn't supposed

15:32.181 --> 15:33.808
to talk, was I?

15:33.850 --> 15:35.393
I'm just so nervous.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.561
Did you kick me

15:35.435 --> 15:36.561
in the butt?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.354
No.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.064
Couldn't have been.

15:38.396 --> 15:40.064
You'd have someone else do it.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.735
A nobleman, like, uh,

15:40.106 --> 15:43.735
Lord Kick-Me-In-The-Butt.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.779
Oops, I'm sorry.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.281
You know, if you put a little

15:45.820 --> 15:48.281
velcro around your wrist

15:48.322 --> 15:50.909
that won't happen anymore.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.245
Nice to meet you.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.792
Oh, my gosh.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.792
I forgot Michelle's picture.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.959
Uh, your majesty, wait.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.252
Alright, nobody move!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.252
Nobody move!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.546
Uh, okay. Just,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.546
just freeze, everyone!

16:03.588 --> 16:06.257
I just want

16:03.588 --> 16:06.257
to get one shot, alright?

16:12.096 --> 16:14.766
I can get double prints

16:12.096 --> 16:14.766
of that if you guys like.

16:27.737 --> 16:31.282
And as you promise

16:27.737 --> 16:31.282
to cling on to each other

16:31.324 --> 16:32.909
for the rest of your life

16:32.951 --> 16:36.663
I now pronounce you

16:32.951 --> 16:36.663
captain and vulcan.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.582
Kimmy, all I'm saying is, think

16:36.704 --> 16:39.582
about what you're doing.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.959
I am thinking about it.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.044
And I think the "Star Trek"

16:41.000 --> 16:44.044
wedding looks nice.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.505
Live long..

16:45.546 --> 16:48.967
...and pay the cashier

16:45.546 --> 16:48.967
on your way out.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.426
How about "Friday The 13th?"

16:50.468 --> 16:52.386
I bet not many people

16:50.468 --> 16:52.386
do that one.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.597
Sounds like a safe bet.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.974
What do you

16:54.639 --> 16:55.974
think, Duane?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.350
Whatever.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.687
Kimmy..

17:00.728 --> 17:02.396
If you don't get on that plane

17:00.728 --> 17:02.396
with me and come home

17:02.438 --> 17:03.857
you're going

17:02.438 --> 17:03.857
to regret it.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.317
Maybe not today,

17:03.898 --> 17:06.317
maybe not tomorrow

17:06.359 --> 17:07.360
but the day after that

17:07.401 --> 17:09.153
you're going

17:07.401 --> 17:09.153
to be miserable.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.571
I'm going through

17:09.195 --> 17:10.571
with this, Deej.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.406
I'm tired

17:10.613 --> 17:12.406
of being a loser.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.034
Maybe if I marry Duane,

17:12.448 --> 17:15.034
I'll be a winner.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.288
So, either go home

17:19.330 --> 17:21.916
or stay here and be

17:19.330 --> 17:21.916
my victim of honor.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.003
Alright.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.463
Let's get ready for the most

17:25.044 --> 17:27.463
romantic day of your life.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.343
"Friday the 13th."

17:32.385 --> 17:33.678
Excellent choice.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.391
Kimmy, you

17:35.179 --> 17:38.391
look so beautiful.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.019
I'm going to cry.

17:45.189 --> 17:47.692
Shall we begin?

17:58.369 --> 17:59.662
[ominous music]

18:00.914 --> 18:01.998
Dearly departed

18:02.040 --> 18:03.123
we are gathered here--

18:03.165 --> 18:05.418
Hey, hey!

18:03.165 --> 18:05.418
Kill the chainsaw.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.837
The fumes are going

18:05.459 --> 18:07.837
to make me hurl.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
I paid 29.95

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
for this wedding.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.593
- And I want it to be special.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.593
- Sorry.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.555
Dearly departed, we are gathered

18:13.634 --> 18:17.555
here to bring together these--

18:17.597 --> 18:20.140
There they are.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.140
Okay, stop this wedding!

18:20.182 --> 18:23.978
Or call 911.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.396
Thank God

18:24.020 --> 18:25.396
we found you.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.522
I can't believe

18:25.438 --> 18:26.522
you're doing this.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.815
Why would you want

18:26.564 --> 18:27.815
to get married?

18:27.857 --> 18:30.401
I'm not getting married.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.401
Kimmy is.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.736
- Kimmy?

18:31.778 --> 18:34.822
Oh, well, then,

18:31.778 --> 18:34.822
by all means, continue.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.200
I think this is

18:34.864 --> 18:38.200
the bride's side here.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.786
Didn't you guys

18:38.242 --> 18:39.786
read my note?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.538
Yeah, we did, but after Comet

18:39.827 --> 18:42.538
slobbered all over it.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.540
It kind of lost something

18:42.580 --> 18:44.540
in the translation.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.460
Hey, I'm trying

18:44.582 --> 18:47.460
to get married here.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.587
Guys, Kimmy's throwing

18:47.501 --> 18:49.587
her life away.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.338
Can't you talk to her?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.338
She won't listen to me.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.049
You want us

18:51.380 --> 18:53.049
to talk to kimmy?

18:53.091 --> 18:56.176
We spent the last eight years

18:53.091 --> 18:56.176
trying to avoid her.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.511
I don't know

18:56.218 --> 18:57.511
what I'd say to her.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.180
Well, what were you

18:57.553 --> 19:00.180
going to say to me?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.809
Well, I-I did write down

19:00.222 --> 19:02.809
some notes on the airplane

19:02.850 --> 19:05.770
on this airsick bag.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.980
Great.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.731
Hey, Kimmy

19:08.773 --> 19:12.151
before you do this, just listen

19:08.773 --> 19:12.151
to my dad and Uncle Jesse.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.694
Okay, but make it quick.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.530
I'm getting

19:13.736 --> 19:16.530
a splitting headache.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.532
Alright, I-I'll tell you

19:16.572 --> 19:18.532
what I was going to tell DJ.

19:18.574 --> 19:22.912
Just have a seat, we'll put in

19:18.574 --> 19:22.912
a few li'l modifications to..

19:22.954 --> 19:24.872
...you know.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.499
Okay.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.043
This thing's not on,

19:26.540 --> 19:29.043
is it?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.337
Alright. Okay.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.546
Um..

19:32.588 --> 19:35.008
"You're making a terrible

19:32.588 --> 19:35.008
mistake, DJ."

19:35.049 --> 19:36.300
Uh..

19:36.342 --> 19:38.344
He means Kimmy.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.930
Um, "You know

19:38.385 --> 19:40.930
how much we love you."

19:40.972 --> 19:44.391
We basically tolerate

19:40.972 --> 19:44.391
you as best we can.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.812
"Uh, There's a whole world

19:46.352 --> 19:47.812
of opportunities

19:47.854 --> 19:49.480
still open to you."

19:49.522 --> 19:53.484
Yeah, there's still a few

19:49.522 --> 19:53.484
chances you haven't blown yet.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.610
Guys, forget it.

19:54.652 --> 19:55.945
Let's face it.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.572
I've got nothing

19:55.987 --> 19:58.572
going for me but plunger boy.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.407
Love you, sweetheart.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.784
Whatever.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.497
This isn't working.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.874
Uh, Kimmy, what we're trying

20:06.539 --> 20:07.874
to say here

20:07.915 --> 20:08.958
is that we-we-we

20:09.000 --> 20:13.671
we...we care

20:09.000 --> 20:13.671
about you.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.422
Really?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.422
You do?

20:15.464 --> 20:16.549
I can't believe

20:15.464 --> 20:16.549
what I'm hearing.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.510
I can't believe

20:16.590 --> 20:19.510
what I'm saying.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.803
Listen,

20:19.552 --> 20:20.803
the point is that

20:20.845 --> 20:22.096
we don't want you

20:20.845 --> 20:22.096
to do something

20:22.138 --> 20:24.390
that you're going

20:22.138 --> 20:24.390
to regret, okay?

20:24.431 --> 20:25.808
Now, look

20:24.431 --> 20:25.808
inside your heart.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.518
Now, if you,

20:25.850 --> 20:27.518
if you really, really

20:27.560 --> 20:30.897
deep down inside,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.897
love this-this-this Duane guy

20:30.938 --> 20:32.732
then I say,

20:30.938 --> 20:32.732
what the heck?

20:32.773 --> 20:34.942
I say start up the chainsaw

20:32.773 --> 20:34.942
and get married.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.652
Okay, but don't do it because

20:34.984 --> 20:36.652
you're trying to run away

20:36.694 --> 20:39.197
from problems or you're looking

20:36.694 --> 20:39.197
for the safe way out

20:39.238 --> 20:42.033
or you just want to make sure

20:39.238 --> 20:42.033
you, you have a plumber

20:42.075 --> 20:44.077
at 3:00 in the morning.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.078
Wait a minute.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.495
I'm starting

20:45.119 --> 20:46.495
to get the idea

20:46.537 --> 20:50.833
that you guys don't think

20:46.537 --> 20:50.833
I should get married.

20:50.875 --> 20:55.421
Kimmy, let's do this

20:50.875 --> 20:55.421
without the hatchet.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.049
You know this wedding

20:55.462 --> 20:58.049
is a bad idea.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.427
Yeah, I know.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.179
You guys are right.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.723
I guess I do

21:03.221 --> 21:05.723
have other options.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.433
I just can't

21:05.765 --> 21:07.433
think of any right now.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.477
Kimmy, you can go to summer

21:07.474 --> 21:10.477
school and get your grades up

21:10.519 --> 21:12.646
and go

21:10.519 --> 21:12.646
to a community college.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.065
Yeah, but

21:14.107 --> 21:15.482
Deej

21:15.524 --> 21:18.611
it still won't be

21:15.524 --> 21:18.611
the same without you.

21:18.652 --> 21:21.072
I'm really going

21:18.652 --> 21:21.072
to miss you.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.158
Who am I going

21:22.031 --> 21:24.158
to hang out with

21:24.200 --> 21:26.660
talk to about boys?

21:26.702 --> 21:29.789
Copy my homework from?

21:29.830 --> 21:31.207
Kimmy, no matter

21:29.830 --> 21:31.207
where we are

21:31.249 --> 21:33.167
we're always going

21:31.249 --> 21:33.167
to be friends.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.795
Nothing's ever

21:33.209 --> 21:35.795
going to change that.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.838
You're right.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.215
Thanks, Deej.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.762
And you guys will always

21:42.509 --> 21:44.762
be a part of my life, too.

21:44.804 --> 21:48.015
Oh, goody.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.684
Now, I can die happy.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.352
But how am I going

21:50.726 --> 21:52.352
to break it to Duane?

21:52.394 --> 21:53.271
He'll be heartbroken.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.563
Oh, wait,

21:53.312 --> 21:54.563
let, let me

21:54.605 --> 21:55.940
take care

21:54.605 --> 21:55.940
of this one.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.484
Oh, uh,

21:55.982 --> 21:58.484
oh, Duane.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.860
Duane.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.655
Listen, Duane,

22:00.987 --> 22:02.655
uh..

22:02.696 --> 22:04.115
I don't know

22:02.696 --> 22:04.115
how to..

22:04.157 --> 22:05.658
I don't know how

22:04.157 --> 22:05.658
to break this to you

22:05.699 --> 22:09.578
but, uh,

22:05.699 --> 22:09.578
the wedding's off, kid.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.955
Whatever.

22:12.873 --> 22:17.128
He's taking it

22:12.873 --> 22:17.128
a lot harder than I thought.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.504
