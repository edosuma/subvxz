Balki, you'll never guess
who I just had coffee with.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.733
The mayor!

01:41.766 --> 01:45.166
That's right.
The mayor of Chicago!

01:45.200 --> 01:46.533
Well, I didn't actually
have coffee with him

01:46.566 --> 01:49.133
I‐I brought it but I was there
when he drank it.

01:49.166 --> 01:50.266
[laughing]

01:50.300 --> 01:52.066
Since I started working
at the news paper

01:52.100 --> 01:54.133
this kinda thing
happens all the time.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.666
Well, not all the time
but a lot.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.633
A lot.

01:58.433 --> 01:59.600
Yeah, I can't believe it.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.566
Last week I was selling key
chains at the Ritz discount.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.766
And now I'm working
for a major Chicago newspaper!

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
That's, that's nice.

02:07.833 --> 02:10.265
Nice? It's terrific!

02:10.300 --> 02:13.433
Balki, I'm the city editor's
right‐hand man.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.166
Well, not his
right‐hand man exactly.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.233
Like I mean,
you know, I just

02:17.266 --> 02:20.066
run errands for him,
you know, but who cares?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.566
I have my foot
in the door.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.166
I'm finally on my way.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.800
The sky's the limit.

02:25.833 --> 02:28.000
Is that a hockey puck?

02:30.300 --> 02:31.300
Yes, cousin.

02:31.333 --> 02:34.700
It landed right next to me
in that empty seat.

02:36.633 --> 02:37.800
It's a good thing
you weren't there.

02:37.833 --> 02:40.566
You'd have a puck shaped whole
in the middle of your head

02:40.600 --> 02:42.266
and looked like a piggy bank.

02:43.733 --> 02:45.233
The hockey game.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.533
We were supposed to go
to the hockey game tonight.

02:51.333 --> 02:54.000
I got you an Italian
beef sandwich.

02:55.266 --> 02:56.666
With no peppers.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.666
I know how they make
you puff up and turn red.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.166
I‐I'm so sorry.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.366
I completely forgot.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.166
You have every right
to be angry with me.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.766
‐ Oh, cousin, I'm not angry.
‐ Oh, thank you.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.400
I'm just lonely and...

03:12.433 --> 03:14.766
...I guess,
a little hurt.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.800
Well, Balki‐‐

03:15.833 --> 03:19.066
I'm just lonely
and hurt

03:19.100 --> 03:22.166
and I guess,
a little disappointed.

03:24.266 --> 03:28.733
‐ Well, Balki‐‐
‐ I‐I'm just lonely and hurt.

03:28.766 --> 03:31.166
Disappointed and...

03:31.200 --> 03:33.533
...I guess a little angry.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.633
‐ Are you done?
‐ Yes, I am.

03:39.766 --> 03:40.633
Well, Balki‐‐

03:40.666 --> 03:44.333
You know, you never ask
about my life.

03:44.366 --> 03:46.766
Alright‐alright, you‐you're,
absolutely right.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.233
And I won't let it
happen again.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.533
‐ How's your life‐‐
‐ I have no life.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.033

I'm happy for you.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.433

shirts for Mr. Twinkacetti.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.733
And that's isn't enough
anymore, is it?

04:12.200 --> 04:15.400
Oh, cousin, you can read me
like a cheap suit.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.600

what you need?

04:21.632 --> 04:23.766
A reason to live?

04:25.533 --> 04:27.600
Well, yeah, that.

04:29.366 --> 04:32.400
You need to go out
and look for a new job

04:32.433 --> 04:33.566
like I did.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.266
There are
thousands of jobs

04:36.300 --> 04:38.800
right here
in the newspaper.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.333
Now, now... Why don't
you just take tomorrow off

04:41.366 --> 04:43.200
and start looking around.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.733
‐ Will you come with me?
‐ I gotta work.

04:44.766 --> 04:47.300
Oh, I beg your pardon,
I forgot, you have a life.

04:49.300 --> 04:53.066
Alright, alright,
I'll tell you what.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.566
Come down to the paper
at lunch tomorrow

04:55.600 --> 04:57.166

your strategy.

about the game.

‐ Oh.
‐ I'll make it up to you.

05:04.233 --> 05:08.233
‐ Oh.
‐ And this looks great.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.533
‐ Oh.
‐ Ha, ha, I'm starving.

05:09.566 --> 05:12.200
Yeah, you know, I...

05:12.233 --> 05:14.600
...I guess I was
a little upset.

05:14.633 --> 05:16.500
I stuffed a lot of peppers
underneath your beef.

conference at the city hall.

unload that damn thing.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.666
‐ Applegate.
‐ Ah, that's Appleton, sir.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.200
Did you get
that list of the Aldermen

06:06.233 --> 06:07.233
that drive foreign cars.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.333
Yes, sir.

Good job.

drives a foreign car.

on it, sir.

Why is this mail stacking up
here? What's going on?

Well, I‐I, I think,
he's in his office, sir.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.633
You'd think that
the head of the mail room

06:22.666 --> 06:24.666
could at least get
the mail distributed.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.633

I've ever seen.

‐ Pretty impressive, huh?
‐ Yes!

06:36.166 --> 06:38.333
I've finally made it
to the big time.

06:38.366 --> 06:40.733
Oh, you know, what?

06:40.766 --> 06:43.066
I ask everybody
in the building about you

06:43.100 --> 06:45.433
and they never
heard of you.

06:48.666 --> 06:49.766
Is this your office?

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
It's humongous!

to classifieds

start for a few days.

know, sir.

Do you think you can get
that information for me today?

What's falling
into place?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.700
Can you say, "nepotism"?

09:20.733 --> 09:23.366
Well, it's my first day,
but I give‐‐

09:23.400 --> 09:25.266
‐ Nepotism?
‐ He asked me!

09:27.400 --> 09:29.366

for the city editor.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.466
And the next you know, you start
bringin' in your family.

09:32.500 --> 09:35.366
Well, your family may have
gotten you in here

09:35.400 --> 09:37.666
but I decide
if you stay.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.766
Wait a minute?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.233
Aren't you going
to teach me

09:41.266 --> 09:42.633
the tricks
of the trade?

09:42.666 --> 09:44.533
Figure them out
for yourself.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.700
Well, Mr. Gorpley must have

09:49.733 --> 09:52.066
a lot of confidence in me.

09:53.266 --> 09:55.600
Excuse me, the only thing
Gorpley's got

09:55.633 --> 09:57.533
is a nephew
who needs a job

09:57.566 --> 09:59.466
and you just took it.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.633
Now, listen here.

10:02.133 --> 10:03.400
You'd better be careful.

10:03.433 --> 10:06.166
One mistake,
and you gone.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.166
Oh, thank you, thank you
for the warning, M‐Mrs...

10:09.200 --> 10:10.433
Oh, I'm sorry, uh

10:10.466 --> 10:13.266
Balki Bartokomous,
this is Harriette Winslow.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.300
‐ Nice to meet you.
‐ How do you do?

10:15.333 --> 10:17.066
Harriette runs
the elevator here.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.533
Oh‐h‐h.

10:18.566 --> 10:21.033
Well, your job must
have its ups and downs.

10:23.633 --> 10:25.233
Is this elevator
going up?

10:25.266 --> 10:27.600
No, this week
it's going sideways.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.266
Come on, Balki.
She's got work to do.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.433
Hang on.

10:49.466 --> 10:50.566
Okay, buddy.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.566
Balki.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.100
Let's see
if you're qualified

10:55.133 --> 10:56.566
to work
in a mail room.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.800
I want you to sort this
mail according to zip codes.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.166
These‐these don't have
no zip code.

11:04.200 --> 11:05.566
Hey, you wanna quit?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.333
No, no, no!

11:07.366 --> 11:09.633
I want to do
the best job I can.

11:09.666 --> 11:11.033
You know,
what I think?

11:11.066 --> 11:12.466
I think, this time tomorrow

11:12.500 --> 11:13.700
you're gonna be history.

11:13.733 --> 11:16.700
Oh, well, thank you
for the vote of confidence.

11:19.733 --> 11:22.166

to discuss
their grievances."

23:02.450 --> 23:04.450
That was beautiful.

23:07.017 --> 23:09.283
Well, it never even would
have made it into the paper

23:09.317 --> 23:10.583
if you hadn't fished it
out of the trash.

23:10.617 --> 23:12.383
Oh, cousin,
that's okay.

23:12.417 --> 23:14.650
You helped me, with my work
when you were on that deadline.

23:14.683 --> 23:17.083
[Larry]
No, I just saw
you were in trouble.

23:17.117 --> 23:18.450
But you risked your job for me.

23:18.483 --> 23:20.250
Ah, it was instinct.

23:20.283 --> 23:23.183
You know, Balki.

23:23.217 --> 23:25.317
I think working together
at the newspaper

23:25.350 --> 23:26.350
is gonna be great.

23:26.383 --> 23:28.117
Oh, I do, too.

23:28.150 --> 23:30.983
Cousin, your first
newspaper article.

23:31.017 --> 23:31.983
Hm.

23:35.383 --> 23:37.050
Your first of many.

23:40.483 --> 23:41.450
And you know what?

23:41.483 --> 23:43.683
You're going to have to buy
a bigger scrapbook.

23:54.550 --> 23:57.517
But not for
a long, long time.

24:05.117 --> 24:06.517
