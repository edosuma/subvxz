WEBVTT

00:08.907 --> 00:10.718
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:10.742 --> 00:13.121
Excuse me. Hi.

00:13.145 --> 00:14.589
Excuse me, I... I was...

00:14.613 --> 00:16.681
I've been actually waiting for that sp...

00:24.556 --> 00:25.600
Excuse us.

00:25.624 --> 00:27.335
Uh, excuse me.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.237
Ouch!

00:29.261 --> 00:30.528
Honestly.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.180
Okay.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.281
Excuse me.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.784
I'm looking for...
it's a duck that dances.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.719
Promotional display on seven.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.588
On seven. Okay.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.389
Where's... where's seven?

00:46.413 --> 00:47.891
Uh, I think they're over this way.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.559
They're over there. They're over here.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.894
- Move it!
- Move, move!

00:50.918 --> 00:51.928
- I see them!
- Excuse me.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.530
Ouch. Ow.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.898
- Move.
- I saw it first.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.132
- Yes.
- My kid's better than yours.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.434
Yes! Yes!

00:57.458 --> 00:59.369
- Hey!
- I got the last one!

00:59.393 --> 01:01.738
Who's the best dad now, huh, Cody?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.573
- Yeah!
- Hey!

01:05.432 --> 01:07.611
Let go of the duck!

01:07.635 --> 01:08.812
Mine!

01:08.836 --> 01:09.980
That is enough.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.214
Stay away!

01:11.238 --> 01:13.183
Stay away! Stay away from me!

01:13.207 --> 01:15.218
Back off!

01:15.242 --> 01:16.987
What is wrong with you people?

01:17.011 --> 01:19.322
This is not what Christmas
is supposed to be like!

01:19.346 --> 01:21.157
You people are animals!

01:21.181 --> 01:22.993
Hold it right there.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.729
Now, get your hands up
where I can see them, now.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.465
I'm gonna need you
to hand me that pepper spray.

01:31.752 --> 01:33.530
Look, Santa, I...

01:33.554 --> 01:34.965
I just wanted the Dancing Dapper Duck

01:34.989 --> 01:36.934
for my little girl, and that is all.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.101
I know.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.838
Now just give me the can.

01:40.862 --> 01:42.773
Come on, now. That's it.

01:42.797 --> 01:44.541
You don't want to hurt anyone.

01:44.565 --> 01:46.777
Just give it to me.

01:46.801 --> 01:48.467
That's it right there.

01:53.441 --> 01:54.685
Holy mother...

01:54.709 --> 01:56.253
My duck!

01:56.277 --> 01:58.555
Thank you, thank you so much
for saving that.

01:58.579 --> 02:00.190
I mean, at least if I have to go to jail,

02:00.214 --> 02:01.525
I'm leaving with what I came for.

02:01.549 --> 02:03.894
Sorry, but that toy
is going into evidence.

02:03.918 --> 02:05.195
What?

02:05.219 --> 02:06.597
Sir, this burning is gonna go away.

02:06.621 --> 02:08.298
It's just gonna take a couple hours.

02:08.322 --> 02:11.935
Long before you need to be back
in the North Pole.

02:11.959 --> 02:14.838
Is Santa Claus gonna die?

02:14.862 --> 02:16.673
Oh, hey. No, no, no.

02:16.697 --> 02:19.476
Of course not, and don't you worry.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.711
He's not really Santa.

02:20.735 --> 02:22.379
He's not real?

02:22.403 --> 02:24.548
No, no, sweetie. He's just pretend.

02:24.572 --> 02:26.350
Santa's pretend?

02:26.374 --> 02:28.185
- That's right.
- Buck, Buck, Buck.

02:28.209 --> 02:29.720
- Mm-mm.
- What?

02:29.744 --> 02:32.055
Did you just tell my kid
Santa isn't real?

02:32.079 --> 02:34.091
Mm-hmm.

02:34.115 --> 02:36.059
Uh, no, no.

02:36.083 --> 02:39.763
I was... I was just explaining
that this Santa isn't Santa.

02:40.788 --> 02:42.799
Hey, Cody, what's the matter?

02:42.823 --> 02:45.269
Santa Claus isn't real.

02:50.164 --> 02:53.299
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:59.574 --> 03:00.998
Right.

03:03.778 --> 03:05.738
All right, that's everything
in the closet.

03:05.762 --> 03:06.790
All right.

03:06.814 --> 03:08.725
Okay, let's see how much we can get done

03:08.749 --> 03:11.895
before your mom and Bobby get back.

03:11.919 --> 03:13.931
Should we even be doing this
without them?

03:13.955 --> 03:15.165
It's kind of Mom's thing.

03:15.189 --> 03:16.433
Well, it usually is,

03:16.457 --> 03:18.335
but when have you known your mother

03:18.359 --> 03:20.437
to wait this late in the season
to have her tree up?

03:20.461 --> 03:22.072
Well, it's been a lot this year.

03:22.096 --> 03:23.674
I mean, I don't think anyone's really

03:23.698 --> 03:25.008
feeling the Christmas spirit.

03:25.032 --> 03:27.010
And that's why we are going to spread

03:27.034 --> 03:28.712
some holiday magic.

03:28.736 --> 03:31.014
All right? And...

03:31.038 --> 03:33.684
Harry, untangle these lights.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.586
You really think a tree
is gonna make Bobby forget

03:35.610 --> 03:36.753
he might have cancer?

03:36.777 --> 03:38.355
- Harry.
- What? It's the truth.

03:38.379 --> 03:40.190
Yeah, but we don't think
that way in this house.

03:40.214 --> 03:43.727
Okay, this is Bobby's first
Christmas with his new family,

03:43.751 --> 03:45.529
and we are gonna do
everything that we can

03:45.553 --> 03:46.930
to make it special for him.

03:46.954 --> 03:47.931
Right?

03:47.955 --> 03:49.066
Okay.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.667
Okay.

03:50.691 --> 03:52.311
Wait a minute.

03:52.335 --> 03:53.437
Who's making popcorn?

03:53.461 --> 03:55.495
I'll do it.

04:12.546 --> 04:14.057
Oh, what's all this?

04:14.081 --> 04:15.125
We got you a tree.

04:15.149 --> 04:17.127
Well, you certainly did.

04:17.151 --> 04:19.296
Oh, it's a beauty.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.664
So how'd it go?

04:20.688 --> 04:22.499
Well, he's not fully in the clear,

04:22.523 --> 04:25.469
but thank God
this is the last test for now.

04:25.493 --> 04:27.004
They've all been clean,
so the doctor says

04:27.028 --> 04:28.672
he has no reason
to think it'll get worse.

04:28.696 --> 04:30.173
And once we get these results,

04:30.197 --> 04:31.675
then we can breathe.

04:31.699 --> 04:34.011
So I hear there are tidings
of comfort and joy.

04:34.035 --> 04:37.114
Mm, not quite joy,
but we're working on it.

04:37.138 --> 04:39.883
Oh, that's... that's great news.

04:39.907 --> 04:42.052
Hey, you guys, um...

04:42.076 --> 04:43.820
I gotta get going.

04:43.844 --> 04:45.422
You're leaving?

04:45.446 --> 04:49.026
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I got a lot of work to do.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.527
My love? I'll see you.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.943
- Bye
- Okay. Oh, yeah.

04:53.654 --> 04:55.165
My man, my man.

04:56.323 --> 04:57.601
Bye.

05:01.328 --> 05:02.662
It got ugly.

05:03.397 --> 05:06.043
After I said I had to work on Christmas,

05:06.067 --> 05:07.678
he went straight to his room
and wouldn't speak to me

05:07.702 --> 05:09.146
- for the rest of the night.
- Mm.

05:09.170 --> 05:11.682
It's just new. He'll get over it.

05:11.706 --> 05:13.383
Abuela's bringing him to my aunt's.

05:13.407 --> 05:14.551
I know he's gonna have a great time.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.387
He just... last Christmas was...

05:18.071 --> 05:19.572
special.

05:20.114 --> 05:21.224
This one's harder.

05:21.248 --> 05:22.292
Uh-huh.

05:22.316 --> 05:24.628
Is that why you invited us all here?

05:24.652 --> 05:26.630
Trying to cram in as much Christmas cheer

05:26.654 --> 05:27.898
between now and then?

05:27.922 --> 05:29.633
Well, thought it'd be nice

05:29.657 --> 05:31.982
to bring the boys
together for a playdate.

05:33.027 --> 05:35.172
All three of 'em.

05:35.196 --> 05:37.541
All right, who needs more cement?

05:37.565 --> 05:38.842
- I do.
- Me.

05:38.866 --> 05:40.782
Denny, we will do you first

05:40.806 --> 05:42.512
with this big ol' piece.

05:42.536 --> 05:44.381
- Hey, Buck.
- Yeah.

05:44.405 --> 05:47.107
Can I spend Christmas with you?

05:49.577 --> 05:50.587
I'm sorry, buddy,

05:50.611 --> 05:53.090
but I'm gonna be working

05:53.114 --> 05:55.792
on Christmas with... with your dad.

05:55.816 --> 05:58.451
Stupid work.

05:59.286 --> 06:00.731
I promise you.

06:00.755 --> 06:03.633
He'll forget he was even mad
by New Year's.

06:06.127 --> 06:07.437
Is it just me,

06:07.461 --> 06:09.028
or does Christmas suck this year?

06:11.232 --> 06:12.943
Definitely not just you.

06:12.967 --> 06:15.712
It's been a rough year... for everyone.

06:15.736 --> 06:18.915
So I'm happy to immerse myself
in the magic of Christmas,

06:18.939 --> 06:21.985
and I just look forward
to putting this year behind me.

06:22.009 --> 06:23.553
I wouldn't be surprised
if there's one more

06:23.577 --> 06:25.945
smack in the face to come.

06:28.149 --> 06:29.749
Maddie, are you okay?

06:30.818 --> 06:33.096
Yeah, I just really
wasn't expecting this.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.931
Christmas came early.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.433
Yeah, it is always at Christmas.

06:36.457 --> 06:39.069
Even now, he can't let me have any peace.

06:39.093 --> 06:41.138
I'm sorry, this just feels
like blood money.

06:41.162 --> 06:42.606
But it isn't.

06:42.630 --> 06:45.876
It's your share of the marital assets.

06:45.900 --> 06:49.146
You're entitled to every penny of that.

06:49.170 --> 06:50.814
How?

06:50.838 --> 06:53.316
I thought I wasn't entitled
to anything legally.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.685
The Slayer Statute
only applies to murder.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.155
Which you didn't commit.
It was self-defense.

06:58.179 --> 07:01.147
Maddie, that money is the least
that Doug owed you.

07:02.483 --> 07:06.229
Look, Maddie, I have
no sage words of wisdom here.

07:06.253 --> 07:08.665
Keep it, donate it, burn it.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.000
It's your call.

07:10.024 --> 07:12.002
Because according
to the state of Pennsylvania,

07:12.026 --> 07:14.271
that money is yours.

07:20.668 --> 07:22.179
I'm telling you. Destination Christmas?

07:22.203 --> 07:23.847
Greatest idea we've ever had.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.482
I just don't know how
Christmassy it's gonna feel

07:25.506 --> 07:27.851
for the kids
when it's 90 degrees in Hawaii.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.820
Oh, yeah, that whopping
five-degree difference

07:29.844 --> 07:31.488
from L.A. is really gonna
ruin the whole thing.

07:31.512 --> 07:33.190
Next.

07:33.214 --> 07:34.414
Where are we headed today?

07:34.438 --> 07:35.640
Honolulu.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.360
And will you be checking any luggage?

07:37.384 --> 07:39.296
Yes, just these two.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.297
And the clubs.

07:40.321 --> 07:41.631
Oh, no, no, no.

07:41.655 --> 07:44.334
Not letting these babies out of my sight.

07:44.358 --> 07:46.184
Just a little early
Christmas gift to myself.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.570
I'll carry these on.

07:47.594 --> 07:50.841
Sir, you can't carry on
golf clubs onto the plane.

07:50.865 --> 07:52.899
TSA policy. You'll have to check 'em.

07:57.872 --> 07:59.182
Oh, come on. Really?

07:59.206 --> 08:01.374
Sir. The clubs.

08:09.049 --> 08:11.061
Just...

08:11.085 --> 08:12.395
please be gentle with them.

08:12.419 --> 08:13.797
Uh-huh.

08:22.162 --> 08:23.630
Come on, man. Chop, chop.

08:30.237 --> 08:31.414
You know the tracking numbers

08:31.438 --> 08:33.082
don't say which one of us
sorted the bags, right?

08:33.107 --> 08:34.251
Just toss 'em.

08:34.275 --> 08:35.751
All right? Save us all some time.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.821
Where's your Christmas spirit?

08:37.845 --> 08:39.089
People's lives are in these bags,

08:39.113 --> 08:40.557
and they've entrusted them to us.

08:40.581 --> 08:43.193
Any one of them
might be filled with presents,

08:43.217 --> 08:44.584
and those presents might be...

08:48.088 --> 08:49.555
Fragile.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.173
No room left here?

08:57.197 --> 08:58.775
We'll have to wait for another cart.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.344
Like hell we will. Give me those.

09:01.368 --> 09:02.512
No, I...

09:02.536 --> 09:03.780
Holiday hustle, damn it.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.415
- Come on.
- Oh.

09:07.608 --> 09:09.152
Whoops.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.316
Hey, look out!

09:21.455 --> 09:22.632
What...

09:35.636 --> 09:37.647
Oh, my God. My clubs!

10:05.632 --> 10:06.776
Yes!

10:11.705 --> 10:12.705
Yeah!

10:14.170 --> 10:16.170
_

10:26.649 --> 10:28.160
Baggage handler chased a runaway cart

10:28.184 --> 10:29.728
into the engine inlet hazard zone.

10:29.752 --> 10:31.496
The aircraft was taxiing.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.831
Both fans were spinning.

10:32.855 --> 10:34.466
These things,
they suck in the square footage

10:34.490 --> 10:36.768
of a four-bedroom house
every second, so...

10:36.792 --> 10:39.504
Buck, Eddie, get me, uh...

10:39.528 --> 10:40.505
everything.

10:43.566 --> 10:45.710
Officer, you might
want to clear this tarmac

10:45.734 --> 10:46.745
and that window up there.

10:46.769 --> 10:47.879
Once we open this thing up,

10:47.903 --> 10:49.915
it's probably not gonna be very pretty.

10:49.939 --> 10:52.050
Whoa. That's impossible.

10:52.074 --> 10:53.752
- Sir, can you hear me?
- We got a live one.

10:54.977 --> 10:57.287
Okay, we need to take
this thing apart now.

10:59.215 --> 11:02.317
Let's get that nose off,
then we can remove the blades.

11:04.653 --> 11:06.187
Easy, guys. Easy.

11:10.059 --> 11:11.103
I can see him in there.

11:11.127 --> 11:12.537
He seems to be in one piece.

11:12.561 --> 11:14.632
I don't see a lot of blood.

11:15.131 --> 11:17.642
Okay, very carefully,
let's pull him out of there.

11:17.666 --> 11:19.111
Easy.

11:26.842 --> 11:28.253
This is unbelievable.

11:28.277 --> 11:29.621
Nothing appears to be broken.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.756
What stopped the compressor?

11:31.780 --> 11:33.825
Looks like these got sucked in first.

11:33.849 --> 11:36.061
Locked up the blades.

11:42.057 --> 11:44.714
Uh, Cap?

11:47.930 --> 11:49.608
It's just a nosebleed.

11:49.632 --> 11:51.910
Could've been allergies.
Could've been the Santa Anas.

11:51.934 --> 11:54.212
Could've been how cold it was
out there on that tarmac.

11:54.236 --> 11:55.914
Was this your first nosebleed?

11:55.938 --> 11:57.249
Have your gums been bleeding?

11:57.273 --> 11:59.697
Do you have a rash anywhere I can't see?

11:59.722 --> 12:01.300
What are you doing?
Are you diagnosing me?

12:01.324 --> 12:03.936
I haven't noticed any shortness
of breath or bruising,

12:03.960 --> 12:06.138
but you could be hiding
symptoms like a headache,

12:06.162 --> 12:07.973
dizziness, irregular heart rate.

12:07.997 --> 12:09.141
Are you?

12:09.165 --> 12:10.976
Buck, I'm not hiding any symptoms,

12:11.000 --> 12:12.812
because I'm not having any symptoms

12:12.836 --> 12:14.580
of whatever it is you think I have.

12:14.604 --> 12:17.850
That tunnel fire,
you were in there way too long.

12:17.874 --> 12:19.652
Okay, that much exposure to radiation

12:19.676 --> 12:21.153
can cause aplastic anemia.

12:21.177 --> 12:24.000
Did you know that's
what killed Marie Curie?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.378
No, I did not know that.

12:25.402 --> 12:26.679
I also did not know that you knew

12:26.703 --> 12:27.680
who Madame Marie Curie was.

12:27.704 --> 12:29.048
Well, I had to look her up.

12:29.072 --> 12:30.583
But she was as really smart lady,

12:30.607 --> 12:32.018
and she still died

12:32.042 --> 12:34.520
from too much exposure to radiation.

12:34.544 --> 12:37.123
Buck, listen, I appreciate your concern,

12:37.147 --> 12:38.758
but I am fine.

12:38.782 --> 12:42.395
So, please, stop
with the internet research.

12:42.419 --> 12:44.997
Here is our real problem.

12:45.021 --> 12:47.266
We have a tie for Christmas dinner.

12:47.290 --> 12:50.136
Five votes for burgers
and five votes for Chinese.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.305
Five people voted Chinese food?
I voted turkey.

12:52.329 --> 12:54.106
Huh. You were the only one.

12:54.130 --> 12:56.175
The falafel place
got more votes than turkey.

12:56.199 --> 12:57.310
You know what I'm gonna do?

12:57.334 --> 12:58.678
I'm gonna switch my vote to Chinese.

12:58.702 --> 13:00.413
I am just not up for cooking
Christmas dinner this year.

13:00.437 --> 13:02.648
Ah, fatigue. Also a symptom.

13:02.672 --> 13:03.883
Come here.

13:03.907 --> 13:05.708
Buck, listen.

13:06.643 --> 13:08.020
I know you're worried,

13:08.044 --> 13:10.523
but there is nothing to worry about yet.

13:10.547 --> 13:12.892
So as my grandmother always used to say,

13:12.916 --> 13:13.959
don't go borrowing trouble.

13:13.983 --> 13:15.728
Bobby, I know...

13:15.752 --> 13:20.599
I do dumb things sometimes
and generally drive you crazy.

13:20.623 --> 13:22.668
You're an important person
in my life, Bobby,

13:22.692 --> 13:25.104
one of the most important.

13:27.664 --> 13:30.476
I don't know what I would do...

13:30.500 --> 13:32.578
if anything were to happen to you.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.087
I think that I've moved past him,

13:41.111 --> 13:42.421
and then something happens,

13:42.445 --> 13:44.957
and he's right back in my life...

13:44.981 --> 13:46.892
in my head again.

13:47.352 --> 13:50.252
Have you moved past him,
or just around him?

13:51.321 --> 13:54.734
You've made a lot of progress,
but on some level,

13:54.758 --> 13:57.726
it feels like you're still
defining yourself through Doug.

13:58.695 --> 14:00.496
Old habits, I guess.

14:01.998 --> 14:05.211
I was 19 when we met,

14:05.235 --> 14:08.957
so most of my adult life, he...

14:09.839 --> 14:11.384
was my life.

14:11.408 --> 14:13.419
Now isn't it time for you?

14:13.443 --> 14:16.055
I mean, a life that's purely
and only Maddie's?

14:16.079 --> 14:19.615
Not a life after Doug,
but a life without him.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.729
I don't think I know the difference.

14:23.753 --> 14:26.932
You still refer to him
as an active presence.

14:26.956 --> 14:30.812
"He has ruined Christmas.
He is in my head."

14:31.528 --> 14:33.028
But Doug's dead.

14:34.998 --> 14:37.110
And I'm the one still holding on.

14:37.534 --> 14:41.046
Now, you've said you've done
exposure therapy.

14:41.070 --> 14:42.648
Have you been back there?

14:42.672 --> 14:44.383
To Hershey?

14:44.407 --> 14:46.141
To where Doug died.

14:49.746 --> 14:51.924
You want me to go to Big Bear?

14:52.333 --> 14:55.837
To what, relive that nightmare?

14:56.286 --> 14:59.165
I want you to go back
to where he hurt you the most

14:59.189 --> 15:00.933
and talk to him out loud.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.058
And I want you to let him go.

15:13.837 --> 15:15.871
Hey, now.

15:20.743 --> 15:23.088
Mm-mm, mm-mm. Don't be greedy.

15:25.815 --> 15:27.960
I thought you had a shift.

15:31.287 --> 15:33.322
Michael!

15:42.487 --> 15:43.454
Hey.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.511
Hey!

15:47.192 --> 15:48.669
- What you doing out here?
- Mm.

15:48.693 --> 15:51.172
My ex-husband, he snores.

15:51.196 --> 15:52.840
Come again?

15:52.864 --> 15:54.942
Michael's in there.

15:54.966 --> 15:56.610
- In our bed?
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.634 --> 15:57.945
Why?

15:57.969 --> 16:00.371
I didn't have the heart
to wake him to ask him.

16:06.277 --> 16:07.655
- Hi.
- Good morning.

16:07.679 --> 16:08.823
Hi, Michael.

16:08.847 --> 16:11.125
- Yeah, this is awkward.
- You think?

16:11.149 --> 16:13.794
I don't even remember
coming here last night.

16:13.818 --> 16:15.096
Have you been drinking?

16:15.120 --> 16:16.387
What? No.

16:17.489 --> 16:19.633
Listen, I've been
having trouble sleeping.

16:19.657 --> 16:22.069
And my doctor prescribed sleeping pills.

16:22.093 --> 16:25.306
He said that one
of the side effects could be...

16:25.330 --> 16:26.607
sleepwalking.

16:26.631 --> 16:27.942
But sleep-driving?

16:27.966 --> 16:29.443
Who's even heard of that?

16:29.467 --> 16:30.945
Parasomnia.

16:30.969 --> 16:32.446
It's a type of sleep disorder.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.915
People have been known to walk for miles,

16:34.939 --> 16:37.018
binge-eat, operate heavy equipment,

16:37.042 --> 16:38.652
have sex.

16:38.676 --> 16:40.821
Not that that's what
I'm saying happened here.

16:40.845 --> 16:42.423
Well, I would've noticed.

16:42.447 --> 16:43.691
I'm mortified.

16:43.715 --> 16:45.359
You don't need to be. We're family.

16:45.383 --> 16:47.128
But you do need to tell your doctor,

16:47.152 --> 16:48.729
because if that's what this is,
it could be dangerous.

16:48.753 --> 16:50.421
Yeah, I-I'll do that.

16:51.656 --> 16:53.334
What are you doing?

16:53.358 --> 16:55.336
I just want to make sure that
I don't walk into your house

16:55.360 --> 16:57.605
or into your bedroom
in the middle of the night.

16:57.629 --> 16:59.173
Michael, this is your house too.

16:59.197 --> 17:00.341
No, it's not.

17:04.402 --> 17:05.469
I'm sorry.

17:08.299 --> 17:09.532
Very sorry.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.315
Michael.

17:20.385 --> 17:22.363
So you sure you don't mind
calling Athena?

17:22.387 --> 17:24.932
All right, I-I just want
to know what she thinks.

17:24.955 --> 17:27.935
I'll give her a call
as soon as I get back tonight.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.304
Wait. You guys are still in the car?

17:30.328 --> 17:31.405
Yeah.

17:31.429 --> 17:33.974
Gotta love holiday traffic in L.A.

17:34.245 --> 17:36.043
I'm sorry I'm not there.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.645
Hey, you were there when it mattered.

17:37.669 --> 17:40.204
I'm not sure what
you'd be able to do this time.

17:41.339 --> 17:44.185
Truthfully, I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

17:44.209 --> 17:45.553
Buck, I'll call you later.

17:45.577 --> 17:47.421
All right. I'll see you soon.

17:47.445 --> 17:48.579
Bye.

18:06.898 --> 18:08.876
So what do we do now? Knock?

18:08.900 --> 18:12.046
"Hi, can I come in and relive my trauma?"

18:12.070 --> 18:14.048
I think we both know
that this is not the place

18:14.072 --> 18:15.772
where he hurt you most.

18:57.649 --> 18:59.316
Can't keep running!

19:04.656 --> 19:05.789
Maddie!

19:21.706 --> 19:24.518
I never wanted you to die, Doug...

19:24.542 --> 19:26.732
but I do forgive you.

19:27.679 --> 19:30.570
And I forgive myself...

19:31.416 --> 19:33.150
for loving you too much.

19:35.159 --> 19:36.626
For staying too long.

19:38.289 --> 19:40.524
And for not dying right next to you.

19:43.194 --> 19:45.172
So today, I'm gonna leave you here.

19:50.134 --> 19:51.712
I am gonna run out of these woods,

19:51.736 --> 19:54.504
and I am going to live.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.676
I survived you, Doug.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.695
And I will never be sorry for that.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.534
What's this?

20:26.558 --> 20:27.735
I cooked us dinner.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.537
Mac and cheese with hot dogs,

20:29.561 --> 20:31.071
just like Dad used to make us.

20:31.095 --> 20:33.541
Ooh.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.265
Oh, oh, wait. I forgot.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.078
Boom. Pow.

20:38.102 --> 20:39.580
Fancy.

20:39.604 --> 20:42.583
I think Santa's gonna
be very impressed with you.

20:42.607 --> 20:46.009
Good. Because I updated my list.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.390
Two pages long?

20:49.414 --> 20:50.825
Don't worry.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.293
I ranked them in order of importance

20:52.317 --> 20:53.494
so you can prioritize.

20:53.518 --> 20:56.163
You mean so Santa can prioritize.

20:56.187 --> 20:58.532
Mom, come on. I know.

20:58.556 --> 20:59.667
Know what?

20:59.691 --> 21:01.035
You don't have to keep pretending.

21:01.059 --> 21:04.772
Well, maybe I like pretending.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.308
- Why?
- Because...

21:07.332 --> 21:11.078
the rest of the year, life is normal.

21:11.102 --> 21:13.981
And then December rolls around,

21:14.005 --> 21:16.283
and I don't know if it's the lights

21:16.307 --> 21:20.154
or the music or that big guy
in the red suit.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.956
I just know that Christmas

21:21.980 --> 21:25.883
makes the world feel a little more...

21:27.185 --> 21:28.395
Magical.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.455
Okay. I can pretend too.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.824
Uh...

21:40.598 --> 21:42.209
Leo.

21:42.233 --> 21:43.944
Get... get me... get me a glass of water.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.349
Mom, are you okay?

21:48.373 --> 21:49.783
Yeah, yeah, just...

21:49.807 --> 21:51.585
I just... I just... I just need to...

21:51.609 --> 21:54.021
I just... I just need to sit, okay?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.382
Mom!

22:00.843 --> 22:02.477
_

22:02.478 --> 22:04.364
_

22:04.389 --> 22:06.000
Can you tell me your name and address?

22:06.024 --> 22:08.869
Leo. 2749 Elmer Avenue.

22:08.893 --> 22:10.037
North Hollywood.

22:10.061 --> 22:11.639
Okay. Leo, I'm Maddie.

22:11.663 --> 22:12.973
We're gonna get you
and your mom some help.

22:12.997 --> 22:13.974
Do you know what happened?

22:13.998 --> 22:16.210
You said that she fell.
Did she trip, or...

22:16.234 --> 22:18.479
No, we were talking. She just fell over.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.947
Is anyone else in the house with you?

22:19.971 --> 22:21.081
Maybe a grownup?

22:21.105 --> 22:22.416
No, it's just us.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.851
Mom, please.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.653
Mom, you have to wake up.

22:25.677 --> 22:26.887
Can you tell if she's breathing?

22:26.911 --> 22:28.389
I don't know. I don't know.

22:28.413 --> 22:30.224
Okay, look at her chest.
Is it moving up and down?

22:30.248 --> 22:31.559
No.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.527
I want you to put
your cheek against her face,

22:33.551 --> 22:34.995
right near her mouth and nose.

22:35.019 --> 22:36.186
Do you feel any air coming out?

22:38.523 --> 22:39.934
No, she's not breathing.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.969
- Leo, how old are you?
- Um, 10.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.537
All right, paramedics are on their way,

22:43.561 --> 22:44.738
but it would really help
your mom if someone

22:44.762 --> 22:46.206
could do CPR until they get there.

22:46.230 --> 22:48.375
Do you think that you can do that?

22:48.399 --> 22:50.844
I don't know. I'm scared.

22:50.868 --> 22:53.614
I know it sounds scary,
but I can talk you through it.

22:53.638 --> 22:54.748
We'll do this together.

22:54.772 --> 22:56.150
Okay.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.184
Put the phone on speaker and set it down

22:57.208 --> 22:58.819
on the ground next to you.

22:58.843 --> 23:00.888
Is your mom lying
on her back or her side?

23:00.912 --> 23:02.489
Her side.

23:02.513 --> 23:04.992
Let's roll her over
so she's lying on her back.

23:07.251 --> 23:08.896
I want you to hold up your left hand

23:08.920 --> 23:10.264
and spread your fingers wide,

23:10.288 --> 23:11.432
then take your right hand

23:11.456 --> 23:12.833
and put it over your left.

23:12.857 --> 23:14.935
Curl those top fingers
around your bottom hand,

23:14.959 --> 23:16.437
and put it smack in the center
of your mom's chest.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.072
Okay.

23:18.096 --> 23:19.940
Okay, now press down as hard as you can

23:19.964 --> 23:21.575
until you feel her chest move.

23:21.599 --> 23:23.300
Use all of your weight if you have to.

23:25.970 --> 23:28.115
Mom. I think I did it.

23:28.139 --> 23:30.084
Leo, I need you to count with me.

23:30.108 --> 23:33.354
One, two, three, four.

23:33.378 --> 23:35.889
One, two, three, four.

23:35.913 --> 23:38.525
One, two, three, four.

23:38.549 --> 23:40.594
One, two, three, four.

23:40.618 --> 23:42.262
One, two...

23:42.286 --> 23:43.897
I think I heard something crack inside.

23:43.921 --> 23:45.566
I think I hurt her. I didn't mean to.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.034
No, no, no, that means
you're doing it right.

23:47.058 --> 23:49.903
You just... you just need to keep going.

23:54.666 --> 23:57.511
One, two, three, four.

23:57.535 --> 24:00.280
One, two, three, four.

24:00.304 --> 24:03.317
One, two, three, four.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.986
Come on, Mom. Mom, come on.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.773
Hey, it's okay. We've got it from here.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.375
No, the 9-1-1 lady said
I have to keep doing this.

24:28.399 --> 24:30.778
And you have done a great job,
but your part's done.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.179
Now it's our turn. Come on.

24:32.203 --> 24:34.148
Let's get you some air.

24:39.410 --> 24:41.455
No pulse. Starting compressions.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.690
It's definitely cardiac.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.848
Hold CPR.

25:07.872 --> 25:08.916
She's in V-fib.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.974
Gonna shock her. Clear!

25:11.809 --> 25:13.454
She's not converting.

25:15.813 --> 25:17.558
Resume compressions.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.892
Come on.

25:23.421 --> 25:25.099
She's not converting.
Gonna shock her again.

25:25.123 --> 25:26.734
Clear!

25:28.559 --> 25:30.404
Resume compressions.

25:30.428 --> 25:31.739
Come on, come on, come on.

25:41.372 --> 25:43.417
We got a pulse.

26:18.142 --> 26:21.388
The police officer wouldn't
let me go with my mom.

26:21.412 --> 26:23.123
Am I in trouble?

26:23.147 --> 26:26.460
Is it because I hurt her?
I didn't mean to.

26:26.484 --> 26:27.895
Of course not.

26:35.993 --> 26:38.939
I just want her to be okay.

26:38.963 --> 26:40.463
You did everything right.

26:42.668 --> 26:45.802
I think you probably saved her life.

26:46.871 --> 26:49.082
Captain, Social
Services are on their way.

26:49.106 --> 26:50.607
- Copy that.
- You got it.

26:53.845 --> 26:57.514
I'm sorry. I gotta get back to work.

27:03.221 --> 27:04.354
Oh, thanks.

27:06.023 --> 27:07.000
You staying with him?

27:07.024 --> 27:09.827
Yeah, I'll make sure he is
okay until they get here.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.606
Hey.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.875
Merry Christmas, Wilson.

27:14.899 --> 27:16.476
Yeah.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.178
Merry Christmas.

27:22.874 --> 27:25.252
Come on.

28:07.970 --> 28:09.948
I thought I told you
you didn't have to come.

28:09.972 --> 28:11.046
Please.

28:11.070 --> 28:13.418
Like I'm gonna let you
Uber home from the hospital.

28:13.442 --> 28:14.754
How did you even get back here?

28:14.778 --> 28:16.645
I told them I was your wife.

28:16.978 --> 28:18.345
What did the doctor say?

28:19.147 --> 28:20.933
They're sending me home.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.007
Well, you said that on the phone.

28:23.031 --> 28:25.829
But what I haven't heard
yet is an explanation

28:25.853 --> 28:29.233
as to how you ended up walking
through a plate glass window.

28:29.257 --> 28:30.490
I got dizzy.

28:31.859 --> 28:33.320
Michael.

28:34.095 --> 28:37.007
This is not an isolated incident.

28:37.031 --> 28:38.375
You've been distracted,
you've been stressed,

28:38.399 --> 28:39.676
you haven't been sleeping,

28:39.700 --> 28:40.978
except when you drove to the house

28:41.002 --> 28:42.212
to get into bed with me.

28:42.236 --> 28:43.447
Now you're getting dizzy

28:43.471 --> 28:45.115
and walking through plate glass windows.

28:45.139 --> 28:47.451
The doctor don't think
these things are related?

28:47.475 --> 28:49.086
Because I do.

28:49.110 --> 28:50.977
I think they're related too.

28:52.046 --> 28:53.457
To me not sleeping.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.958
You know, I'm so sleep-deprived,

28:54.982 --> 28:57.394
I'm probably legally drunk right now.

29:01.759 --> 29:02.699
Okay.

29:02.723 --> 29:04.685
Athena.

29:09.197 --> 29:11.364
This is my first Christmas alone.

29:15.303 --> 29:16.670
God.

29:20.995 --> 29:22.172
Michael.

29:26.302 --> 29:28.881
You're not alone.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.254
You have a family that loves you.

29:33.213 --> 29:35.255
I love you.

29:36.524 --> 29:37.718
I love you.

29:38.893 --> 29:41.171
I love you too.

29:41.195 --> 29:43.073
I love you so much.

29:44.265 --> 29:46.743
Look, I-I don't want you
to worry about me.

29:46.767 --> 29:47.978
After the holidays,

29:48.002 --> 29:49.546
I'm gonna go get a full check-up.

29:49.570 --> 29:50.714
I promise you that, okay?

29:50.738 --> 29:52.524
Okay, good, good.

29:57.044 --> 30:00.157
- Come on.
- Okay.

30:04.318 --> 30:05.352
Hey.

30:07.535 --> 30:09.503
Thanks for coming to get me.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.005
Always.

30:17.265 --> 30:18.800
Always.

30:26.340 --> 30:27.818
But the mom's gonna be okay?

30:27.842 --> 30:30.154
Yeah, they put a stent in.

30:30.178 --> 30:33.423
She'll be home soon,
just not in time for Christmas.

30:33.447 --> 30:36.660
Oh. So what happens
to the little boy until then?

30:36.684 --> 30:38.996
You said they didn't have
any family nearby.

30:39.020 --> 30:42.332
Yeah, he'll be in a group home

30:42.356 --> 30:44.201
until his mother's released.

30:44.225 --> 30:45.425
Huh.

30:47.528 --> 30:49.462
Okay, one more.

30:50.198 --> 30:51.575
Poor kid.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.600
Doesn't seem like very merry Christmas.

30:57.972 --> 31:00.217
Did we mean to buy Denny this many gifts?

31:01.642 --> 31:03.487
Well, I started stashing them
in the attic

31:03.511 --> 31:07.024
because he was snooping,
and I think I lost track

31:07.048 --> 31:08.715
of how much I bought.

31:10.484 --> 31:12.029
Do you ever think
about where Denny would be

31:12.053 --> 31:13.497
if we hadn't stepped in?

31:13.521 --> 31:16.056
Would he have ended up
in a group home too?

31:16.924 --> 31:19.603
I don't know. Maybe.

31:23.798 --> 31:27.144
That kid doesn't know how lucky he is.

31:27.168 --> 31:29.329
Of course not. He's a kid.

31:29.837 --> 31:33.840
Just one more thing to be
thankful for this holiday.

31:40.548 --> 31:41.992
My lab results were posted.

31:42.016 --> 31:42.993
And?

31:43.017 --> 31:45.028
Clear across the board.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.032
Oh, I can finally breathe again.

31:49.056 --> 31:51.301
Oh, I wish you weren't working tomorrow.

31:51.325 --> 31:54.771
I might actually feel like
celebrating the holidays now.

31:54.795 --> 31:56.440
Between weekly trips to the hospital

31:56.464 --> 31:57.908
and whatever's going on with Michael,

31:57.932 --> 32:00.711
I was about ready
to fast-forward to January.

32:00.735 --> 32:02.112
Yeah.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.115
Well, I don't mind working tomorrow.

32:05.139 --> 32:07.484
Christmas Eve has become a much
more important holiday now.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.819
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.621
It's the night that you said yes.

32:12.947 --> 32:14.166
All right.

32:15.716 --> 32:19.029
You got about five hours
till that alarm goes off.

32:19.053 --> 32:21.965
Let's see what else I might
be willing to say yes to.

32:21.989 --> 32:23.717
Oh.

32:29.797 --> 32:33.277
No, Mom, I still can't
make it to dinner tomorrow.

32:33.301 --> 32:35.145
It's not like I can eat anything anyway

32:35.169 --> 32:37.981
with this frickin' toothache.

32:38.005 --> 32:40.717
I know it's Christmas,
but I have to work.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.885
Give me a break.

32:41.909 --> 32:44.354
My mouth is literally killing me.

32:44.378 --> 32:46.690
Yes, I blame you.

32:46.714 --> 32:50.794
I inherited your bad teeth,
and that's your fault.

32:50.818 --> 32:53.130
Double root canal for New Year's.

32:53.154 --> 32:56.633
Yay. What am I doing?

32:56.657 --> 32:59.670
Looking for another tube of benzocaine.

32:59.694 --> 33:01.394
I know. I'll already been through...

33:02.863 --> 33:04.574
Huh.

33:04.598 --> 33:06.843
Okay, Mom, I gotta go.

33:06.867 --> 33:09.636
I love you. Merry Christmas.

33:26.153 --> 33:27.887
Oh, thank God.

33:49.234 --> 33:50.974
_

33:50.974 --> 33:52.686
_

33:52.687 --> 33:54.948
_

33:55.195 --> 33:57.014
_

33:57.014 --> 33:59.649
_

34:00.421 --> 34:03.033
LAFD. Open up, Please.

34:03.057 --> 34:05.135
This is not okay.

34:05.159 --> 34:07.771
Ouch. Jeez.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.773
Okay, ma'am, ma'am, please take a seat

34:09.797 --> 34:11.074
and tell us what's going on.

34:11.098 --> 34:13.110
What's going on? Look at me.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.646
I'm a Smurf, and I need a root canal.

34:16.670 --> 34:19.315
Pulse is steady. Pupils are normal.

34:19.340 --> 34:21.485
How long has this been going on?

34:21.509 --> 34:22.985
The teeth since last week.

34:23.010 --> 34:25.455
The "Avatar" look since I woke up.

34:25.478 --> 34:27.190
And on top of that,
I have to go to work today.

34:27.214 --> 34:28.625
On Christmas!

34:28.649 --> 34:32.351
I mean, what kind of loser
has to work on Christmas?

34:33.521 --> 34:35.998
Right. Sorry.

34:36.023 --> 34:37.967
Ma'am, do you mind if my guys
here take a look around?

34:37.992 --> 34:39.328
Oh, that's fine.

34:39.351 --> 34:40.670
You very handsome men,

34:40.694 --> 34:44.174
please go look through
my messy apartment.

34:44.197 --> 34:46.777
Because this wasn't
humiliating enough already.

34:46.801 --> 34:49.246
Okay, ma'am, have you taken any
colloidal silver supplements?

34:49.270 --> 34:50.480
What? No.

34:50.504 --> 34:51.882
Any silver-based eye drops?

34:51.906 --> 34:53.268
- No, no.
- Nose sprays?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.317
No.

34:54.341 --> 34:56.186
Any medications we should know about?

34:56.210 --> 34:58.088
Benzocaine. Toothache gel.

34:58.112 --> 34:59.489
She used the whole thing.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.359
And a trash can full of empties.

35:02.383 --> 35:03.860
She's seizing.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.696
Okay.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.999
- Got her?
- I got her.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.634
Could be Methemoglobinemia.

35:10.658 --> 35:13.036
Okay, put her on the CO-oximeter.

35:15.796 --> 35:19.543
Methemoglobin levels are 60%.

35:19.567 --> 35:21.378
61. Climbing.

35:21.402 --> 35:22.712
Anything over 70 can be deadly.

35:22.736 --> 35:25.048
Hen, get her on 02. Run a fluid line.

35:25.072 --> 35:26.616
I'll grab the methylene blue chloride.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.717
It's the benzocaine.

35:27.741 --> 35:29.052
Overuse can prevent the body

35:29.076 --> 35:31.421
from releasing red blood cells.

35:35.850 --> 35:37.994
Uh, why is she bleeding chocolate syrup?

35:38.018 --> 35:39.329
Because, blood thinner boy,

35:39.353 --> 35:41.231
Methemoglobinemia causes her blood

35:41.255 --> 35:43.400
to appear much darker than normal,

35:43.424 --> 35:46.002
which then causes her skin
to only reflect blue light,

35:46.026 --> 35:47.838
hence, the Smurf lady.

35:47.862 --> 35:50.207
Methylene blue converts the ferric iron

35:50.231 --> 35:51.541
into ferrous iron

35:51.565 --> 35:53.343
and turns the blood back to red.

35:53.367 --> 35:55.245
I've never seen a case
this advanced, Hen.

35:55.269 --> 35:57.714
Let's give her two doses.

36:02.109 --> 36:04.020
Methemogblin levels dropping.

36:04.044 --> 36:05.778
Skin color's turning back to normal.

36:08.782 --> 36:10.049
Oh, my God.

36:14.188 --> 36:16.132
I'm...

36:16.156 --> 36:17.801
I'm not blue!

36:17.825 --> 36:20.237
Ouch. But my teeth.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.272
How am I gonna get through work?

36:22.296 --> 36:24.040
Well, good news.

36:24.064 --> 36:26.276
You earned yourself a day off.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.934
And a morphine drip.

36:33.730 --> 36:36.009
Look further, come on back!

36:36.279 --> 36:38.190
Three feet. Two feet.

36:39.649 --> 36:41.093
We're good.

36:41.117 --> 36:44.129
Yes. Yes, you are, Captain.

36:44.153 --> 36:45.798
Merry Christmas.

36:45.822 --> 36:47.032
Athena, what are you doing here?

36:47.056 --> 36:48.968
We came to save you.

36:48.992 --> 36:51.904
Someone said you were ordering
takeout for Christmas dinner.

36:51.928 --> 36:55.107
I did vote for turkey.

36:55.131 --> 36:57.799
She say "we?"

37:03.506 --> 37:07.052
Merry Christmas!

37:09.012 --> 37:10.155
Mommy!

37:15.785 --> 37:18.130
- Christopher!
- Dad!

37:20.757 --> 37:22.334
Merry Christmas.

37:22.358 --> 37:24.169
Merry Christmas, Eddie.

37:24.193 --> 37:26.572
Merry Christmas.

37:26.596 --> 37:27.773
Can't believe you did this.

37:27.797 --> 37:29.008
Thank you, Buck.

37:29.032 --> 37:31.110
Well, you inspired me.

37:31.134 --> 37:33.012
You know, I figured we should all

37:33.036 --> 37:36.982
get to immerse ourselves
in the magic of Christmas.

37:37.006 --> 37:40.085
- Aww, this is a great surprise.
- Merry Christmas.

37:40.109 --> 37:42.221
That's not the only one.

37:42.245 --> 37:45.113
Denny and I brought
a few gifts for dinner.

37:48.217 --> 37:50.129
The social worker
said that he had to stay

37:50.153 --> 37:52.031
at a group home during the holidays.

37:52.055 --> 37:53.198
Yeah. She did.

37:53.222 --> 37:54.633
So I convinced the social worker

37:54.657 --> 37:56.466
to let me bring the group home here.

37:58.227 --> 38:00.873
Apparently, there's a serious
overcrowding problem.

38:00.897 --> 38:03.732
Not enough foster parents to go around.

38:05.568 --> 38:08.547
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

38:08.571 --> 38:10.549
maybe we should consider...

38:10.573 --> 38:13.642
We have an appointment with
a social worker on January 3rd.

38:14.945 --> 38:17.445
There's more than one way
to help a family, right?

38:20.683 --> 38:22.655
Merry Christmas.

38:22.679 --> 38:25.153
Merry Christmas.

38:26.222 --> 38:27.833
Maddie.

38:27.857 --> 38:29.568
Sorry we're late.

38:29.592 --> 38:31.093
You know hospitals and red tape.

38:33.096 --> 38:35.263
You're one of the paramedics
that saved me.

38:36.933 --> 38:39.545
- Thank you.
- It was my pleasure.

38:39.569 --> 38:42.114
Though I can't believe you got
them to spring you already.

38:42.138 --> 38:44.216
Well, they were sending me home
tomorrow anyway.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.285
I wasn't gonna miss
Christmas with my boy.

38:46.309 --> 38:48.677
Mom! Mom!

38:49.643 --> 38:50.756
You're here!

38:50.780 --> 38:51.813
Hey.

38:54.717 --> 38:56.384
Come on. Let's go.

38:57.453 --> 38:59.254
Thanks.

39:01.357 --> 39:03.635
So how'd it go?

39:06.062 --> 39:07.662
It wasn't easy...

39:08.297 --> 39:09.942
but I'm really glad I did it,

39:09.966 --> 39:12.845
and I finally feel...

39:13.293 --> 39:14.936
free.

39:15.805 --> 39:18.250
All right, let's eat
before the bell rings.

39:18.274 --> 39:20.008
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

39:21.511 --> 39:22.711
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.692
We are grateful for this food,

39:26.716 --> 39:28.627
and we are grateful to have each other.

39:28.651 --> 39:29.928
Amen.

39:29.952 --> 39:32.030
All right, let's dig in.

40:07.356 --> 40:09.001
I can't believe
you pulled this all together

40:09.025 --> 40:10.803
without us knowing.

40:10.827 --> 40:13.238
Well, Santa isn't the only one
who has elves.

40:13.262 --> 40:15.207
Oh, yeah?

40:15.231 --> 40:19.211
Buck, thanks for helping me with this.

40:19.235 --> 40:21.213
I think your New Year's
resolution should be

40:21.237 --> 40:23.816
to use that head
for good instead of evil.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.385
I will definitely put that
at the top of my list.

40:28.411 --> 40:29.911
I will be right back.

40:40.823 --> 40:42.000
How you feeling?

40:42.024 --> 40:44.359
Man, I'm doing great.

40:45.862 --> 40:48.073
Yeah, this is a nice Christmas.

40:51.601 --> 40:53.726
You know they mean the world to me.

40:54.637 --> 40:56.563
And you to them.

40:57.974 --> 41:00.085
I think we are pretty damn lucky

41:00.109 --> 41:02.410
to have all found each other.

41:04.046 --> 41:06.325
What's going on, Michael?

41:12.755 --> 41:15.248
When I fell, uh...

41:16.325 --> 41:18.593
you know, they did some scans.

41:21.403 --> 41:24.372
They found a mass, Bobby.

41:25.468 --> 41:29.448
Headaches, the fall,
ending up in the wrong bed.

41:33.976 --> 41:35.153
It's a tumor.

41:35.518 --> 41:37.522
What, uh...

41:37.546 --> 41:39.024
what can I do to...

41:39.048 --> 41:43.962
You know, just... just don't
say anything, okay?

41:43.986 --> 41:46.237
Just not today.

41:46.569 --> 41:49.915
I'll go to the specialist
day after tomorrow,

41:49.940 --> 41:53.276
and I'll tell them then.

41:55.731 --> 41:57.399
Just let them...

41:59.702 --> 42:02.795
Just let me have this Christmas.

42:03.606 --> 42:06.485
Hey, Mom wants to take
a picture with everyone.

42:06.509 --> 42:08.810
All right. Absolutely.

42:12.114 --> 42:13.959
Come on. Let's go.

42:18.054 --> 42:19.631
Bobby, hurry.

42:19.655 --> 42:20.799
You got him? Come on, baby.

42:20.823 --> 42:22.167
Wait, where do we...

42:22.191 --> 42:23.702
Just get in where you can fit in.

42:26.062 --> 42:28.273
All right, on three, everyone, okay?

42:28.297 --> 42:29.908
One, two, three.

42:29.932 --> 42:32.434
Merry Christmas!
