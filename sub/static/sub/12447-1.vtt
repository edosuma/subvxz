02:14.880 --> 02:19.383
The story of my life is the
story of the people in it.

02:20.520 --> 02:23.544
I haven't always been
as lucky as I am now...

02:23.680 --> 02:26.147
in this delicious place of water...

02:26.280 --> 02:28.906
and grass and sunlight.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.944
Mine is a story of
trust and betrayal...

02:33.080 --> 02:35.467
and learning to trust again.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.302
I remember everything.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.024
I'm here, Duchess.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.910
I'll help you.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.910
Come on, old lass.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.343
Come on, push.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.187
Push!

03:27.320 --> 03:32.347
It was cold and too bright
and strange out in the air.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.591
But then my mother kissed me.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.467
I wanted to be nearer to her.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.344
Over here, little one.
It's all right.

04:47.320 --> 04:52.028
In the beginning, I stayed as close
to my mother as I possibly could.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.942
As the weeks went by,
I still stayed right beside her...

05:36.120 --> 05:39.747
but I began to have my own
ideas of what we should do.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.462
So much of the time, she
would just stand there.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.951
Hurry up!

05:45.080 --> 05:46.420
Let's go!

06:59.320 --> 07:02.981
Come on, come on. Hey.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.740
I don't like this.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.465
I do not like this!

07:06.600 --> 07:07.986
Don't fight me now.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.029
Everything's changing.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.631
Even I'm changing.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.307
Come on.

07:13.680 --> 07:18.661
A black coat's taking over my baby
fur. It's all happening too fast.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.746
When I turned 3...

07:36.880 --> 07:41.224
my master sent me to spend the
year with a gang of other colts.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.187
Now it was time.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.625
Training.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.424
The bit was the first thing.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.462
Terrible bars of cold, hard steel between
your teeth and over your tongue.

08:22.840 --> 08:27.264
If you've never had one in your mouth,
you can't imagine what a shock it is.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.390
But thank heaven for oats!

08:40.520 --> 08:44.227
When you're eating them, you can
forget the bit's nasty coldness...

08:44.360 --> 08:46.349
the bitter, metallic taste.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.344
Delicious oats.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.469
Sweet oats.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.668
Lovely, crunchy oats.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.431
Beautiful oats.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.424
Splendid oats... Ow!

08:59.800 --> 09:02.301
Here. It's just a saddle.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.104
It's choking me!

09:05.760 --> 09:07.942
You can still move. Promise.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.308
Nobody could walk with this.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.188
Come back here with those oats.

09:33.040 --> 09:38.067
At first, the iron shoes made
my feet feel stiff and heavy.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.581
I said, "No!" But he said, "Go!"

10:02.680 --> 10:03.827
Come on.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.661
Once I discovered that he and I...

10:06.800 --> 10:09.221
that the two of us
could become one...

10:09.360 --> 10:14.022
this business turned out
to be perfectly glorious!

11:08.000 --> 11:11.263
It was now time for me
to go to a new home.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.749
My mother was proud of me...

11:13.800 --> 11:15.470
and encouraged me.

11:15.640 --> 11:19.461
She knew my master would only
let me go to good people.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.266
But I would miss her.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.141
Before long, a man came to
take me to Birtwick Park...

11:37.280 --> 11:39.542
to live with Squire
Gordon's family.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.589
Just a moment! Molly!

11:41.760 --> 11:44.909
- Come here with that pony.
- Run, Merry. Faster!

11:49.560 --> 11:52.550
Please stay inside. You're
still much too weak.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.306
I won't break. I want to see him.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.868
It's a horse. Nothing more,
nothing less, I promise.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.669
A beautiful horse!

12:01.720 --> 12:04.505
Beauty is as beauty does.
How was he, John?

12:04.560 --> 12:05.991
Perfect, sir.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.508
They were shooting rabbits near
Highwood and the guns went off.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.869
He pulled at such, and looked,
but he didn't step off the path.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.230
- Did you, young fella?
- What shall we call him?

12:16.360 --> 12:19.464
We'll decide over tea.
You must get out of this air.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.022
He's as black as ebony.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.985
Ebony.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.905
Ebony.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.142
Sounds like "bones."

12:32.200 --> 12:33.711
Settle him in the stables.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.066
Pleasure, sir.

12:37.680 --> 12:41.068
We'll call him Blackbird,
after your uncle's old horse.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.510
But Blackbird was ugly,
and mean-tempered. Heh.

12:45.920 --> 12:49.229
- Wait. You've already named him.
- Pardon?

12:49.360 --> 12:52.031
- "Beauty is as beauty does."
- That's not a name.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.871
Yes, it is. Beauty.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.109
Black Beauty.

12:59.240 --> 13:02.264
A new name, a new home...

13:02.400 --> 13:05.583
and a stable full of
new horses to meet.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.468
She'll be all right.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.909
She was ill-tempered.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.028
She was mean-spirited.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.069
She was vicious.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.905
She was the most beautiful
creature I'd ever seen.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.746
I hate Alfred.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.501
Me too.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.181
- Let me down!
- Ha-ha-ha.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.750
Lazy pony!

14:25.680 --> 14:26.861
Move!

14:26.920 --> 14:28.510
Stop it!

14:51.400 --> 14:53.025
Move along!

15:04.320 --> 15:05.831
Merrylegs!

15:05.920 --> 15:07.590
- Quick, Merrylegs!
- Run!

15:09.960 --> 15:12.301
Keep running, Merrylegs!

15:37.320 --> 15:38.467
Mine too.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.389
Open mine too!

15:51.520 --> 15:52.906
Merrylegs.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.984
What a perfect name for
the little fellow.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.986
Leave him alone!

16:05.160 --> 16:06.500
Whoa there, Joe!

16:11.680 --> 16:13.987
Better let young Joe catch
him, Master Alfred.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.069
He needs the practice.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.910
Go on now. Round them up.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.949
Thank you for offering to help.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.471
I expect it's time for
your tea now, isn't it?

16:27.600 --> 16:29.509
Yes, I expect it is.

16:29.560 --> 16:33.824
Teatime, girls. Jessica,
Molly, come along.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.831
It's a good thing John
came along when he did.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.789
It certainly is.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.068
Joe had a good heart...

16:44.120 --> 16:46.029
but really not a clue.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.022
Stand Still, will you?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.505
Stop running.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.667
Come on, everybody!

17:02.720 --> 17:05.550
What a wonderful place.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.825
I flew down to her.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.063
I knew it would be
magic between us.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.988
Hey! Wait a second.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.984
What do you think you're doing?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.226
Please!

18:00.520 --> 18:03.908
Eh, easy, Ginger, easy.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.791
- What's the matter with her?
- They must've battered her.

18:06.840 --> 18:12.424
We treat her well and give her her head,
she'll come round, surely enough. Easy.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.991
Back him on in.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.102
Kind treatment makes
good horses, Joe.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.064
Bad treatment ruins them.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.545
Eh.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.906
Straighten him out.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.227
I can't.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.660
Yes, you can.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.799
Was I ever going to
win her affection?

18:40.840 --> 18:42.510
When we came to the hill...

18:42.600 --> 18:45.510
instead of slowing down and
leaving me to do the work...

18:45.680 --> 18:50.183
she threw her weight into the collar
and pulled away, straight up.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.946
Our paces matched perfectly.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.544
I was sure that afterwards, things
would be different between us.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.591
They were.

19:02.720 --> 19:04.390
They were worse.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.987
Now she ignored me completely.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.343
I bounded. I leaped to the sky!

19:10.400 --> 19:13.743
I tried everything to
get her attention.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.710
Even though I was new...

19:54.880 --> 19:58.951
the squire and John trusted me to
get them safely back from town...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.990
no matter how terrible the storm.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.871
The wild branches tried to grab me.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.741
The rain stung my eyes
like a thousand bees!

20:27.360 --> 20:28.825
Keep moving, Beauty!

20:39.280 --> 20:41.064
The bridge was flooded.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.188
But it looked safe.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.701
As I reached the middle, I knew
at once that something was wrong.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.305
Beauty, forward!

20:58.400 --> 20:59.945
Go forward!

21:06.840 --> 21:11.229
Everything inside me screamed
not to go any further.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.144
Go forward!

21:13.200 --> 21:16.747
I wanted to obey him,
but he was wrong.

21:23.920 --> 21:25.988
I know, chum. I know.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.668
No! How can I make you understand?

21:34.720 --> 21:37.107
We can't go near there!

21:37.240 --> 21:38.751
Come on, Beauty.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.905
For me.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.666
I stood fast.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.301
I tried to tell him.

21:51.800 --> 21:52.981
That's enough!

22:02.640 --> 22:03.741
John!

22:16.240 --> 22:19.310
I didn't know how long I
could hold on to him.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.502
I had to hold on!

23:12.160 --> 23:13.910
God bless you, Beauty.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.226
John.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.785
What happened?

23:26.960 --> 23:29.142
I'll be all right, mistress.

23:30.240 --> 23:33.184
I just need to look
after the horse.

23:33.320 --> 23:35.502
You will not. You'll
come inside at once.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.350
But Beauty needs looking after.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.588
I'll look after him, Uncle John.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.306
All right. Do what
I've shown you, Joe.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.991
Not Joe.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.662
He doesn't know what to do.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.061
The drying sweat and rain sent
a chill down to my bones.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.502
You don't need that rug.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.986
You're boiling hot.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.665
I wanted my rug.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.221
I wanted a heap of rugs.

24:17.720 --> 24:22.223
The icy water hit my stomach
like a kick in the guts.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.424
But I was so thirsty.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.470
By the next morning...

24:33.520 --> 24:35.463
I was sick.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.031
Ginger stayed up all night with me.

24:43.360 --> 24:46.270
Feeling sorry for me softened her.

24:49.800 --> 24:50.981
Oh, dear Lord.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.346
Oh, Beauty.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.670
It hurts.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.549
There's no rug put on.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.863
Stupid, stupid boy.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.146
Joe. I expect the water
was cold as well.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.708
Run to the house and
bring another blanket.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.670
Now!

25:39.600 --> 25:40.826
Come on, Beauty.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.622
You must drink it, come on.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.749
My poor Beauty.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.390
My good horse.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.342
Let's hope it does him some good.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.344
You go on to bed now, John.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.544
I'll stay with him tonight.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.623
We've done the best we can.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.787
He may need some help.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.511
Every little noise was torture.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.710
- Alfred!
- Alfred, stop it!

27:42.480 --> 27:45.106
Ha-ha-ha. Told you!

27:48.920 --> 27:50.590
Children, that's enough!

27:51.640 --> 27:53.822
They're fine, dear.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.825
Please get well.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.709
Beauty.

28:56.160 --> 29:00.504
Uncle John! Uncle John!
Come and see Black Beauty!

29:01.160 --> 29:03.342
Ginger.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.986
I was put into a
paddock to recuperate.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.985
Joe came to visit me every day.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.785
Catch me if you can!

29:43.880 --> 29:46.950
What's wrong? Can't
you get up here?

29:48.520 --> 29:50.748
Ha, ha. All right, I'm coming.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.783
What are you doing?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.431
Whoa, whoa.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.587
No! Not the sheets!

30:20.040 --> 30:21.187
Sorry!

31:59.840 --> 32:01.749
My mistress had become so ill...

32:01.880 --> 32:03.823
that we had to take
her to a doctor...

32:03.960 --> 32:06.984
a specialist who lived far away.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.862
You'll not smoke that
pipe in these stables.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.149
Yeah, yeah. Keep your
shirt on, skinny.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.261
Evening.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.070
Ah. Evening.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.629
That idiot left a lamp up here.

32:44.680 --> 32:48.546
Little know-it-all ought
to mind his own business.

32:53.400 --> 32:58.427
Joe. You complain about my pipe, you
fool, but you leave a lamp near the hay.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.263
For you to see by. Bring
it down here, will you?

33:02.400 --> 33:04.741
Lucky for you I came up here.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.182
What? What's that?

33:12.320 --> 33:15.390
Beauty! It's only for tonight.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.987
What are you afraid of?
You'll be all right.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.347
I'll be back for the
horse in the morning.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.031
I'm off too.

33:25.160 --> 33:28.104
Easy, Beauty. Shh...

33:28.280 --> 33:29.461
Eat your hay.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.986
The sounds and smells
were so strange.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.869
I didn't know what they were.

34:04.040 --> 34:08.190
If you've never heard or smelled
something, how can you understand it?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.189
Whoa, Beauty. I'm here.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.341
No. I can't leave Ginger!

35:18.200 --> 35:20.223
I won't let it hurt you!

35:22.160 --> 35:24.183
Don't look at it!

35:30.600 --> 35:32.304
I couldn't see anything.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.502
I had to follow him!

35:52.720 --> 35:54.026
Joe!

36:01.240 --> 36:02.944
Joe!

36:46.240 --> 36:48.183
Joe saved us.

36:48.240 --> 36:52.902
The other horses were rescued too,
but no one could help our mistress.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.149
Her illness was so advanced...

36:55.200 --> 36:58.747
that the doctor told her
to move to a warmer place.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.911
The family would have
to leave England...

37:02.320 --> 37:03.945
and us.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.706
Right this way. Leaving
in five minutes.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.141
Goodbye, John. Bless you.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.421
Please God, we may see
you back again soon.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.383
Portsmouth train leaving
from platform one.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.591
We love you, Merrylegs.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.066
You're the best.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.109
We'll never forget you.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.741
Time to go, sisters.

37:43.840 --> 37:48.104
I want to thank you, John, for your
faithful service to my family.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.348
We shall never forget you, sir.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.627
Goodbye, my Beauty.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.709
Nevermore were we
to see our family.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.701
Nevermore.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.782
It was our last time together
in the big pasture...

38:30.440 --> 38:33.942
but it was something nobody
could ever take away from us.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.030
They were dancing!

39:47.920 --> 39:50.910
The vicar came to
take Merrylegs away.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.590
He'd promised the squire
he would never sell him.

39:55.480 --> 39:59.904
I hated saying goodbye to
that plucky little pony.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.786
In no time, Ginger and Joe and I...

40:22.880 --> 40:27.781
also found ourselves miles away
from everything dear and familiar.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.351
Horses to the back! What
do you think you're doing?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.304
I swear to you...

41:17.440 --> 41:19.622
someday, somehow...

41:20.400 --> 41:22.548
I'll be with you again.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.307
Take me with you now.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.904
Joe.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.065
Don't go.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.662
But he was gone.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.782
Lady Wexmire, Lord Wexmire...

42:38.840 --> 42:40.590
Lord George.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.780
They stared.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.625
Staring at us with
their critical eyes.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.147
To them, we were no more alive...

42:48.200 --> 42:51.224
than the bits of
harness on our backs.

42:55.360 --> 42:58.384
Look at the long legs
on the chestnut mare.

42:58.520 --> 43:02.181
What a hunter she'd make.
She'd fly over the jumps.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.710
You must put these horses'
heads higher, York.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.905
They're not accustomed
to the bearing rein.

43:09.040 --> 43:12.269
Their groom said they'd never
used the rein on either one.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.702
- Didn't he, York?
- He did, my lord.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.830
Be safer to bring
them up by degrees.

43:17.880 --> 43:19.425
Pish-posh!

43:19.560 --> 43:21.662
These animals are
not fit to be seen.

43:21.720 --> 43:25.506
One notch tighter won't
kill them, will it? York?

43:27.720 --> 43:29.868
As you wish, my lady.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.944
Reuben, attend to the mare.

43:41.960 --> 43:45.269
When a bearing rein is tightened,
it pulls back your head...

43:45.400 --> 43:48.663
so that you have to carry
it uncomfortably high.

43:48.800 --> 43:51.665
People think it makes
a horse look fancy.

43:51.720 --> 43:54.061
But it made Ginger angry.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.988
This was a very grand
place we'd come to.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.230
Three or four times the
size of Birtwick Park...

44:08.360 --> 44:10.508
but not at all pleasant...

44:10.880 --> 44:13.221
if a horse may have an opinion.

44:14.760 --> 44:19.024
Ordinarily, we would have put
our heads down and forward...

44:19.160 --> 44:20.591
but not now.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.147
Now we had to pull
with our heads up.

44:23.280 --> 44:26.065
Pain shot through
our backs and legs.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.381
For what?

44:27.560 --> 44:28.900
For fashion.

44:34.920 --> 44:36.988
Rein them tighter, York.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.908
As you wish, my lady.

44:40.520 --> 44:43.191
Reuben, shorten the
bearing rein on the mare.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.024
A bearing rein is well named.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.501
For it is unbearable.

44:48.640 --> 44:50.230
It makes no sense.

44:50.360 --> 44:53.623
And nonsense can drive a horse mad.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.741
Rein them tighter, York!

44:57.920 --> 45:00.466
As you wish, my lady.

45:03.880 --> 45:07.427
I didn't know how much longer
Ginger could stand it.

45:14.640 --> 45:15.946
For pity's sake.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.821
Are you never going to get their
heads up? Raise them at once!

45:19.880 --> 45:21.106
As you wish, my lady.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.944
Quickly!

45:24.680 --> 45:26.748
And then it happened.

45:30.840 --> 45:32.829
You incompetent fool!

45:32.880 --> 45:34.266
Whoa, there!

45:43.160 --> 45:44.591
Keep ahold of her!

45:49.440 --> 45:51.269
Hang on!

45:54.120 --> 45:55.904
I can't be late for the duchess!

46:00.040 --> 46:01.301
Get him! Quick!

46:04.960 --> 46:07.950
Give it here. Now, get that
shaft off. Go on! Get it!

46:15.480 --> 46:17.867
The bloody rein's choking her.

46:17.960 --> 46:19.186
There, lassie.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.582
You idiot! These horses have
got more brains than you!

46:57.440 --> 46:59.030
Cover the chestnut with a blanket.

46:59.160 --> 47:02.389
You fetch hot water and
lotion for the black one.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.463
Whoa, there.

47:25.960 --> 47:27.471
Stay!

47:38.480 --> 47:40.264
Reuben.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.300
Take care of the black one too.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.702
As you wish, Mr. York.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.424
My leg hurt.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.624
The wound was deep.

48:01.760 --> 48:05.626
Well, it's her own silly fault
if she misses her tea party...

48:05.760 --> 48:07.100
not yours.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.222
No, nor mine neither.

48:12.440 --> 48:14.986
It's enough to drive
anybody back to drink.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.707
They put wicked wooden
contraptions around our necks...

48:20.840 --> 48:24.740
so we couldn't even turn our
heads to lick our wounds.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.791
After that...

48:26.960 --> 48:29.984
my lady never called
for Ginger again.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.071
I, on the other hand...

48:32.120 --> 48:35.941
continued to be subject
to her every whim.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.790
Oh...

48:59.720 --> 49:01.345
Reuben.

49:03.880 --> 49:05.266
Look, man, look!

49:26.440 --> 49:28.622
Got a job for us then, Reuben?

49:28.920 --> 49:32.069
Yes. It's stood out
in all weathers.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.507
Between that and the
roads up there.

49:34.880 --> 49:36.584
Plenty of rot here.

49:36.720 --> 49:38.231
Plenty of rot everywhere.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.869
What do they want to do?

49:41.040 --> 49:43.302
Me lady craves a new coat of paint.

49:43.440 --> 49:48.102
I believe your lady could use a good
deal more than a new coat of paint.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.751
Amen.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.703
Keep the horse for me, will you?

49:57.080 --> 49:58.944
Best leave it saddled.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.228
I daren't be late.

50:01.400 --> 50:03.070
Where are you going then?

50:03.200 --> 50:04.426
I'll be back later.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.220
Listen.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.746
There's a loose shoe.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.268
Yeah.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.305
Where are you going?

50:37.560 --> 50:39.503
You mustn't ride him, Mr. Smith.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.742
Now stand up, will you?

50:45.800 --> 50:47.026
He's standing.

50:47.080 --> 50:48.830
Come on, there. Come on.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.631
Now stand up.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.751
Where's your head?

51:42.400 --> 51:43.990
Get out of the way!

51:44.160 --> 51:45.421
Come on.

52:05.480 --> 52:06.661
Hyah!

52:06.720 --> 52:09.187
He pushed me and pushed me...

52:09.240 --> 52:10.785
and pushed me!

52:10.920 --> 52:12.545
What was the matter with him?

52:12.680 --> 52:14.384
I was losing my shoe...

52:14.560 --> 52:17.186
but he had lost his mind!

53:02.440 --> 53:04.304
My body couldn't escape...

53:04.920 --> 53:06.909
but my thoughts could.

53:07.640 --> 53:11.267
They took me away from
that awful place.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.383
Far away.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.384
But there was Reuben...

53:52.440 --> 53:54.861
still lying where he'd fallen.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.870
I stayed with him.

53:57.240 --> 54:01.425
My mother had taught me to
be loyal, no matter what.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.505
Good Lord, what's happened here?

54:08.240 --> 54:11.105
Right. Roll him over.

54:13.400 --> 54:15.662
See if we can get him to his feet.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.785
I'll carry him.

54:31.720 --> 54:34.391
Every step was agony.

54:34.440 --> 54:37.464
I didn't know if my
knees would ever heal.

54:45.360 --> 54:48.430
We don't get to choose
the people in our lives.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.584
For us, it's all chance.

54:59.240 --> 55:00.387
Come on.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.547
Come on, get on. Get on!

55:12.360 --> 55:13.950
Hup!

55:22.320 --> 55:24.707
Come on, come on, come on.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.230
Come on.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.822
Ha-ha! He's won! He's won!

55:48.600 --> 55:49.986
Lovely ride, son.

55:50.120 --> 55:51.710
Thank you, Mama.

55:52.440 --> 55:55.908
Good God, George. What have
you done to the horse?

55:56.080 --> 55:57.830
Didn't you bother to train her?

55:57.880 --> 55:59.584
I won the race.

56:02.200 --> 56:03.870
You've broken her.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.070
She can't breathe properly.

56:06.200 --> 56:10.589
Ginger loved jumping. Her
heart leapt at every fence.

56:10.720 --> 56:13.391
But they raced her
before she was fit...

56:13.520 --> 56:15.429
and it shattered her.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.867
They used to be such
beautiful animals.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.104
Now just look at them. Ruined.

56:21.440 --> 56:24.669
A 12-month run should bring
back the mare's wind, my lord.

56:24.800 --> 56:27.267
Well, the black one
will have to be sold.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.588
I won't have knees like
that in my stables.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.424
Sold?

56:32.800 --> 56:35.346
Every horse knows
that terrifying word.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.428
When they came to take me
away, it was so sudden...

56:47.560 --> 56:51.062
that Ginger and I didn't
even get to say goodbye.

57:07.520 --> 57:10.510
The terrible man who bought
me kept horses for rent.

57:12.640 --> 57:13.787
Suck it in!

57:13.840 --> 57:17.387
I was rented out to anyone
who wanted to hire me.

57:36.280 --> 57:39.589
I was glad my friends
couldn't see me now.

57:41.120 --> 57:43.587
They wouldn't even have known me.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.707
We hated that man.

57:57.360 --> 57:59.349
You missed me, you stupid beasts.

58:38.160 --> 58:40.661
This horse is 20 if it's a day.

58:40.720 --> 58:44.267
This lively place
lifted my spirits.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.551
I'll meet you after the fair, Joe.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.781
Wait!

58:59.960 --> 59:01.824
I know who that is.

59:01.960 --> 59:03.585
It's Joe!

59:03.960 --> 59:06.062
Older, taller...

59:06.720 --> 59:08.629
but it's him!

59:10.560 --> 59:12.071
Where'd he go?

59:18.320 --> 59:20.399
- What happened to his knees?
- Stop!

59:20.400 --> 59:22.787
- He took a spill in the stalls.
- A spill?

59:22.920 --> 59:25.785
What are you doing? Where's Joe?

59:26.720 --> 59:28.231
There he is.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.623
Let me go!

59:33.640 --> 59:35.424
Lively one, isn't he?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.867
Joe, don't leave!

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.705
I'm here!

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.667
Horses for sale!

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.947
Twenty-five guineas, he's yours.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.461
Fifteen.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.747
- Eighteen.
- Sixteen.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.830
- Eighteen!
- Seventeen, not a penny more.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.386
Done!

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.621
How are you supposed
to get through?

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.748
There were too many people.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.028
There was too much noise.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:35.109
The smell was awful.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.629
Coming through. There's a lad.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.349
- Where was the grass?
- Whoa!

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.071
- There we go.
- Where were the trees?

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.267
Excuse me.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.790
It was cramped...

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.260
and damp...

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.066
and dank and dark and dreary.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.663
Jerry, what's wrong with him?

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.026
He's frightened.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:14.947
Step up there.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.347
Let me go. I want
to go and pet him.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.151
Give me a brush,
Dolly. Don't worry.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.225
Harry, put some
straw in that stall.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.185
Dolly, no!

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.865
It's all right.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.591
Come on. Let's do it quietly.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.311
Give him a chance.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.503
Up we go. There we are.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.706
Thank you.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.151
It's like baby fur here.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.267
He's so soft.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.990
Yeah, he is.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.269
Come on, Pol, give us a hand.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.830
How's it going with that straw?

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.027
All ready.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.864
Go and get yourself a brush, then.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.745
There.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.271
He's not so frightened now.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.309
What about when he
has to pull the cab?

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.224
Have faith.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.501
I listened quietly.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.504
What should we call him?

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.028
Uh. Jack. After the old one.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.622
He's far blacker than Jack.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.307
When's he's cleaned,
his color comes up lovely.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.983
- Seeing something in him now, are you?
- I didn't say that.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.101
All right.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.870
We'll call you Black, because you
are, and Jack, after the old one.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.622
And altogether, Black Jack,
because the odds are stacked...

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.108
against us both.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.307
Black Jack.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.665
What you got there?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.023
Black Jack wants to be pretty.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.661
Good idea.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.861
All at once, I had hope.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.069
It's good people that
make good places.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.743
Still, I wondered what
tomorrow would bring.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.745
Walk on. Come on. That's it.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.311
Walk on.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.703
- Babaloo's Food Emporium.
- Rat problem solved.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.347
Vermin exterminated!

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.670
Easy, boy. Easy.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.788
Hello, Jerry! Have
you got a good one?

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.061
Great one!

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.665
He's too black!

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.185
Be good for a funeral!

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.781
Good lad. Come around.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.021
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.704
Braids on his mane and tail?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.269
What? Are you going on a
parade this afternoon, Jerry?

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.588
He wanted to be pretty
for his first day.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.427
"Pretty for his first day"?
Did you hear that, lads?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.028
Well, he's a regular dandy.
A bit like meself.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.989
Why shouldn't you be?

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.464
Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.105
Don't worry.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.150
No worry, old Black,
old Jack, old boy.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.709
Shh. It's all right. Shh.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.949
Jerry's hands.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.989
The quiet of them...

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.188
gave me confidence.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.950
We spent our days at one
cab stand or another...

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.069
collecting passengers.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.949
It was a hard life.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.746
The streets are hard
on a horse's feet.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.108
The cab is hard on a horse's back.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.785
But I was lucky.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.666
I had Jerry. We were
in it together.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.102
- Morning.
- Morning, Dinah.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.591
Cabby!

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.190
There you go, Jerry.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.067
- Cabby!
- Unh!

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.382
- You all right, dear?
- Yes, I'm all right.

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.631
Let's get these up quickly.
You'll get run over.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.270
Look sharp!

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.111
Put on the steam and get
us to Victoria by 10:00.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.781
We'll take you, but
at the regular pace.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.306
It'll mean a shilling extra.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.070
At the regular pace.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.831
I'm your man. I'll get
you there in time.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.110
It's against his conscience to work
his horse into a sweat, but not mine.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.307
Make way.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.030
Coming through!

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.262
Get up. Get up!

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.263
Easy, easy, peasy, little gee-gee.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.144
You all right, Dinah?

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.029
I'm still in one piece, Jerry.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.742
Bonkers, all of them.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.428
Coming through!

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.782
Dinah Brown's mother...

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.342
- ...she's in a bad way.
- Oh?

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.186
Poor Dinah.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.349
She can't even go to her.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.582
The place is in the country...

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.302
and there aren't any
trains on Sunday.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.787
The horse is tired, Polly. I'm tired.
It's our one day of rest.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.103
But oughtn't we treat folks...

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.230
- ...the way we like to be treated?
- Like to be treated? Yes, heh.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.701
You're giving me my Sunday
sermon early today.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.104
I know if my mother was dying...

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.582
A lighter cart would make a
wonderful difference to the horse.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.187
Look!

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:20.747
Here comes butcher Dawes now
to lend you his light trap.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.785
Yes.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.145
You're a clever woman.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.585
All right.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.024
Fix me some bread and
cheese and I'll get ready.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:07.821
Feel free to tie your
horse with the cows.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.109
The meadow belongs to
us, not to the estate.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:15.703
I'd rather set him loose. It'd be a
real treat for him to have a turnout.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.745
Kind to me, kind to the horse...

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.024
Run inside and see your mother.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.390
You're a tough one, Jerry. How
can a person ever repay you?

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.511
Here we go.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.386
Here we go.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.462
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.025
Grass!

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.228
Not a cobblestone in sight.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.350
I couldn't believe my eyes.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.348
Now, where's that biscuit?

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.981
Running made me very happy.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.425
Why shouldn't Jerry be happy too?

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.380
Hey, Black!

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.471
I want that!

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.380
Give it to me!

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.471
Give it here!

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.666
Right.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.430
Thanks.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.231
The visit to the
country refreshed me.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.868
But I found I couldn't
stop thinking of her.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.226
Then as if by magic...

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.825
there she was.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.387
My beautiful Ginger.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.542
Oh, God, she was skin and bones.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.189
What had they done to her?

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.908
She was almost too weak
to know who I was.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.343
It's me, Ginger.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.626
It's me.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.108
The brightness was gone
from her beautiful eyes.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.431
Her face, once so full of spirit,
was now full of suffering.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:11.502
I tried to comfort her.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.621
I wanted her to know
she wasn't alone.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.668
Don't give up, Ginger.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.665
Get up!

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.185
Get on with you.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.506
My precious friend.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.226
That night, I dreamed of her.

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.182
I dreamed of what was.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.904
And I dreamed of what
might have been.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.710
I'm here.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.991
What is it?

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.466
And then I knew.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.701
Goodbye, my sweet one.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.110
Just be patient.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.867
It's ladies and gents
who pay our rent.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.306
They'll be out anytime
now, you'll see.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.586
Begging your pardon, sir, I was
engaged to come round at 9:00.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.505
As it's after midnight,
perhaps they wouldn't...

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.631
You'll be wanted soon enough.
The party's nearly over.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.387
We waited for our passengers.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.663
And waited.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.866
People aren't thoughtless
just to horses.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.027
They're also cruel to each other.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.063
Bless your heart, old man.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.861
Good night.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.710
Get a move on!

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.589
It's freezing.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.305
Just in a moment, sir.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.431
Don't be impertinent. We could've
had two more drinks "in a moment."

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.187
Walk on.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.983
Something was the matter.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.140
Jerry always looked after me.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.981
But here was the boy instead.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:05.508
Harry, I didn't want to
trouble them in the house.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.347
How's your dad?

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.910
It's in his lungs, Mr. Crenshaw.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.627
I'm very sorry.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.310
Doctor says he'll tell Mom tonight.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.630
He says Dad can't
drive cabs no more.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:22.827
Keep your chin up.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.665
Help your mom.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.027
Never drive a cab again?

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.864
How could that be?

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:48.065
It was good to be outside.
I wanted to go back to work.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:51.264
No, Black. We're not
going to the cab stand.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.549
We're just stretching
your old legs, old Jack.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.864
- Morning, Dinah.
- Morning, Harry. Is your mama home?

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.742
Dolly, what do you
think you're doing?

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.422
Packing. We're moving
to the country.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.747
What?

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.747
Daddy's going to drive coaches. Dinah
says he'll never have to drive a cab...

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.789
ever again.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:31.505
Mom!

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.828
What would happen now?

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.029
Even though cab work had
taken its toll on me...

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.987
I had hoped to spend the
rest of my days with Jerry.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.666
Goodbye...

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.829
beautiful Black.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.824
Daddy said to give
you a kiss for him.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.826
I was sent to a grain dealer, where
Jerry expected me to be treated fairly.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.106
But what he expected
and what was...

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.867
were as different as a kind
word is from a whiplash.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:02.980
Come on!

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.349
For two long years,
I pulled the heavy carts...

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.223
until I could not pull anymore.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.902
Sixteen guinea for the pair.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.869
Wants you to ride and drive.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.751
16 guineas. Who'll
give me 16 guineas?

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.062
Anybody out there?
16 guineas for the pair.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.268
It's not worth
bothering about them.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.464
There's nothing for them
but the butcher's knife.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.871
I was too weak to care.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:59.347
Awful.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.581
Was that one a carriage
horse, Granddad?

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.189
He might have been anything.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.026
He's a finer build than
the other horses, though.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.991
Wouldn't you say, Joe?

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.024
Poor old thing.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.984
Expect we'll have better
luck next month at Langley.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.784
That voice.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.505
It woke me up.

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.463
I knew that voice.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.181
It was Joe!

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.424
Black Beauty.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.744
I'm here, Beauty.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.141
I'm here.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.949
Shh.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.663
You're safe now.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.550
Shh.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.391
I have now lived in this
happy place a whole year.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.149
My strength and spirits are back.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.431
Joe promises me I'll never be sold.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.268
My troubles are over...

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.787
and I am at home.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.551
Often...

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.541
I fancy I'm still in the big
pasture at Birtwick Park.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.700
I'm together with my old friends.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.904
And nothing...

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.620
will ever separate us again...

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.511
ever.

01:24:06.305 --> 01:24:12.776
