14:53.269 --> 14:55.604
BUT HOW DID
YOU GET THE MONEY?

14:55.771 --> 14:57.773
I SOLD THE TEAM.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.277
YOU WHAT?

15:01.443 --> 15:03.153
IT WAS WORTH
HALF OF WHAT I GOT

15:03.320 --> 15:06.490
JUST TO SEE THE LOOK
ON MRS. OLESON'S FACE
WHEN I PAID THE ENTIRE BILL

15:06.657 --> 15:09.618
AND I BOUGHT
ALL THIS BESIDES.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.079
YOU SOLD THE TEAM?

15:13.372 --> 15:14.999
BUT HOW COULD YOU?

15:15.165 --> 15:17.668
HOW COULD YOU DO
SUCH A FOOLISH THING?

15:17.835 --> 15:19.920
THOSE HORSES REPRESENT
THE ONLY SURE WAY

15:20.087 --> 15:21.964
OF GETTING BACK
ON YOUR FEET AGAIN!

15:22.131 --> 15:23.841
JONATHAN,
WHAT'S IN YOUR MIND?

15:24.008 --> 15:25.217
PROVIDING.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.678
PROVIDING FOR THE NEEDS
OF MY FAMILY.

15:27.845 --> 15:29.388
WHATEVER ELSE
IS IN MY MIND?

15:29.555 --> 15:30.889
BUT I TOLD YOU
I CAN WORK.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.975
I AIN'T TAKING
CHARITY FROM MY WIFE.

15:33.142 --> 15:35.060
OH, YOU FOOL.
IT'S NOT CHARITY.

15:35.227 --> 15:36.395
DON'T CALL ME THAT!

15:36.562 --> 15:38.564
I WORKED AS HARD AS I CAN,
AND MAYBE I FAILED,

15:38.731 --> 15:40.399
BUT I AIN'T GONNA BE
CALLED NAMES FOR THAT,

15:40.566 --> 15:42.234
AND I AIN'T GONNA BE
LOOKED DOWN ON ANYMORE!

15:42.401 --> 15:43.819
I'M THROUGH, ALICE!

15:43.986 --> 15:45.613
THROUGH!

16:11.430 --> 16:13.807
I GOT THE LAST
OF THE CORN ALL STACKED.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.392
THINK IT'LL ALL FIT
IN THE WAGON?

16:15.559 --> 16:19.146
JUST BARELY. MAY HAVE
TO PUT A FEW EARS
IN MY POCKET.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.023
HEY, HALF-PINT!

16:21.190 --> 16:23.150

THOSE HORSES YET?

16:23.317 --> 16:25.486
OH. I'LL DO IT NOW.

16:31.825 --> 16:32.993

16:33.160 --> 16:34.411
YEAH?

16:34.578 --> 16:37.331

REALLY GOING TO MANKATO
WITH YOU FRIDAY?

16:37.498 --> 16:39.208
YEAH. I'M AFRAID
HE IS.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.709
FOR GOOD?

16:41.919 --> 16:43.921
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT HE SAYS.

16:47.091 --> 16:49.385

16:52.096 --> 16:53.472
I DON'T KNOW,
DARLING.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.641
DIFFERENT REASONS,
I GUESS.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.602
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T THINK

16:58.769 --> 17:01.772

ANYBODY WHO'S EVER
GOTTEN DIVORCED.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.399

17:03.565 --> 17:05.984

17:20.791 --> 17:25.504

THOSE TWO BREAKING UP.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.381
I KNOW.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.678

OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.514
WELL, JONATHAN WON'T
HEAR ANOTHER WORD

17:35.681 --> 17:37.725
FROM ME ON THE SUBJECT.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.435
I'M THINKING OF ALICE.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.603
I'M GOING TO
GO TALK TO HER.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.815
I CAN'T JUST LET HER SIT THERE
AND LET THIS HAPPEN!

17:44.982 --> 17:48.026
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO SAY TO HER?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.362
I DON'T KNOW...

17:51.613 --> 17:53.240
YET.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.245
YOU SURE YOU WON'T
MIND BEING ALONE
TONIGHT, MA?

17:58.412 --> 17:59.705
COURSE I MIND,

17:59.872 --> 18:02.791
BUT YOU WANT TO SEE
AS MUCH OF YOUR
FATHER AS YOU CAN

18:02.958 --> 18:04.376
IF HE'S LEAVING
ON FRIDAY.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.503
MAYBE HE'LL DECIDE
TO STAY SOON AS HE
SEES HOW NICE

18:06.670 --> 18:08.839
THAT OLD CABIN'S
GOING TO LOOK.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.841
MAYBE HE WILL.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.762
YOU REALLY WANT HIM
TO STAY, DON'T YOU?

18:16.889 --> 18:20.934
WHAT I WANT DON'T SEEM
TO MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.187
NOW YOU GO ON.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.810
YOU KEEP SCRUBBING
ON THAT WOOD,

19:02.976 --> 19:04.728
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
IT WORN PLUMB OUT.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.022
NOBODY'S LIVED
IN THIS PLACE
FOR A LONG TIME.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.690
I WANT IT
TO LOOK NICE.

19:08.857 --> 19:14.112
I--I KNOW, BUT, UH,
I'LL BE LEAVING
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.661
IT'S FOR WHEN
YOU COME BACK.

19:23.372 --> 19:25.040
ANDY, UH, I...

19:25.207 --> 19:29.461
OH, PA, I'M AFRAID
I'M NEVER GOING TO
SEE YOU AGAIN!

19:29.628 --> 19:31.338
NOW, YOU KNOW
THAT AIN'T TRUE.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.591
I...I'LL BE COMING
TO SEE YOU, AND...

19:34.758 --> 19:36.426
AS SOON AS
I GET SETTLED,

19:36.593 --> 19:40.806
WHY, YOU'LL BE COMING
TO STAY WITH ME
FOR NICE, LONG SPELLS.

19:40.973 --> 19:43.851
YOU MEAN THAT?
I CAN?

19:44.017 --> 19:45.435
COURSE I DO.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.979

19:47.145 --> 19:48.981
DOUBLE PROMISE.

19:59.116 --> 20:02.411
Alice: I EXPECT THINGS
WON'T BE SO AWFUL BAD.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.747
I MEAN, WITH ME WORKING
AT THE POST OFFICE,

20:05.914 --> 20:08.876
AT LEAST ANDREW
AND I WON'T BE STARVING.

20:10.335 --> 20:17.134
AND...IT GIVES ME
SOMETHING TO PUT
MY MIND ON BESIDE...

20:34.902 --> 20:38.030

AN AWFUL LOT, DON'T YOU?

20:41.450 --> 20:42.993
YES.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.830
ALWAYS WILL, I EXPECT.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.210
DO YOU THINK
HE LOVES YOU?

20:53.795 --> 20:56.340
I KNOW HE DOES.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.717
IT SEEMS
SUCH A WASTE.

20:58.884 --> 21:02.179
I KNOW IT IS,
CAROLINE, BUT WHAT
CAN ANYBODY DO?

21:02.346 --> 21:03.430
WELL, SOMETHING.

21:03.597 --> 21:04.514
WHAT?

21:04.681 --> 21:06.433

21:09.561 --> 21:12.606
YOU'D WANT JONATHAN
TO COME BACK,
WOULDN'T YOU?

21:12.773 --> 21:14.566
OH, OF COURSE.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.860
HAVE YOU TOLD HIM THAT?

21:19.237 --> 21:22.491
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
HE KNOWS HOW I FEEL.

21:22.658 --> 21:25.911
WELL, YOU'D BE MORE SURE
OF THAT IF YOU TOLD HIM.

21:26.078 --> 21:29.456
OH, HONESTLY,
CAROLINE, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU!

21:29.623 --> 21:33.752
I MEAN, HOW COULD YOU
EVEN THINK I COULD DO
SUCH A THING?

21:33.919 --> 21:35.337
WHEN YOU
LOVE SOMEBODY,

21:35.504 --> 21:37.673
IT'S WORTH
PUTTING YOUR PRIDE
BEHIND YOU.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.925
IT'S MORE THAN PRIDE.

21:40.092 --> 21:41.259
IS IT?

21:41.426 --> 21:45.430
YES. I NEVER DID
A SINGLE THING

21:45.597 --> 21:46.890
TO BREAK UP
THIS MARRIAGE.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.767
IT WAS JONATHAN'S
DOING FROM THE START,

21:48.934 --> 21:51.103
AND WHEN HE WALKED OUT,
THAT WAS HIS DOING, TOO!

21:51.269 --> 21:53.188
SO YOU'RE RIGHT,
AND HE'S WRONG.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.731
YES.

22:00.487 --> 22:04.616
WELL,
I HOPE BEING RIGHT
IS ENOUGH FOR YOU,

22:04.783 --> 22:08.203
BECAUSE YOU'RE SURE
PAYING A HIGH PRICE
FOR IT...

22:09.705 --> 22:12.082
AND SO IS ANDREW.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.474
THIS AIN'T LIKE
A REAL GOOD-BYE, SON.

22:29.641 --> 22:32.644
I'LL BE COMING BACK
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
TO SEE THAT CIRCUIT JUDGE.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.688
CAN'T I WAIT UNTIL AFTER
MR. INGALLS COMES?

22:34.855 --> 22:36.440
NO. THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
LATE FOR SCHOOL.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.734
THERE AIN'T
NO SENSE IN THAT.

22:40.944 --> 22:45.741
SON, I'M--I'M GLAD YOU
WANTED TO STAY WITH ME
THESE LAST FEW DAYS.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.285

CHANGE YOUR MIND?

22:48.452 --> 22:50.704

GETTING UPSET, NOW.

LIGHT, AREN'T YOU?

23:42.714 --> 23:44.674
I'M GOING TO
LEAVE THE REST OF
MY STUFF HERE.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.218

IT'LL BE SAFE.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.428
YOU COULD STORE IT
IN MY BARN, IF YOU WANT.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.014
NO. ANYBODY THAT
NEEDS TO BORROW
WHAT LITTLE I GOT

23:51.181 --> 23:53.308

THIS IS EASY FOR ME?

24:26.341 --> 24:28.426

TO SAY WHAT
I CAME TO SAY,

IN FRONT OF CHARLES,
SO BE IT.

FOR ANYTHING?

BUT I--

DON'T YOU
LOVE ME AT ALL?

I GOT TO BE
GETTING HOME.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.084
CHARLES,
I--I BEEN THINKING.

29:53.251 --> 29:55.086
THE FACT THAT
ME AND ALICE
CAN'T GET ALONG,

29:55.253 --> 29:58.465
THAT DON'T MEAN
THAT SHE AIN'T
A GOOD WOMAN.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.925
I'M GLAD YOU SEE THAT.

30:01.092 --> 30:04.387
I DO SEE THAT, AND I
JUST CAN'T WALK AWAY

30:04.554 --> 30:06.181
AND LEAVE
HER WITH NOTHING.

30:06.347 --> 30:08.808
SHE'S GOT THE HOUSE
AND THE LAND.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.310
THAT AIN'T ENOUGH.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.479
YOU KNOW THAT FIELD,
THE UPPER FIELD--

30:12.645 --> 30:14.105
THE ONE I WAS
GOING TO CLEAR?

30:14.272 --> 30:16.983
IT'S GOOD SOIL,
AND IT'LL MAKE
GOOD FARMLAND.

30:17.150 --> 30:19.319
I'M GOING TO
CLEAR IT FOR HER.

30:19.486 --> 30:23.239
THAT'LL MAKE
THE PROPERTY WORTH
MORE, AND...

30:23.406 --> 30:26.075
WELL, INSTEAD OF
JUST SITTING HERE

30:26.242 --> 30:30.622
AND WAITING FOR
THAT CIRCUIT JUDGE,
I COULD BE WORKING.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.209
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:37.378 --> 30:39.672
I THINK WE OUGHT
TO START HOME.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.147
ANDREW, YOU'VE GOT
TO EAT SOMETHING.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.483
I'M JUST
NOT VERY HUNGRY.

30:58.650 --> 31:02.153
I CAN'T GET USED TO
THE IDEA HE'S GONE.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.448
WELL, WE'RE JUST
GOING TO HAVE TO.

31:09.369 --> 31:12.830
IF YOU'RE DONE,
YOU BEST GET
TO YOUR CHORES.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.749
YES, MA'AM.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.341
PA!

31:31.140 --> 31:32.517
Andrew: PA!

31:32.684 --> 31:33.726
PA!

31:33.893 --> 31:35.687
YOU'VE COME BACK!

31:35.853 --> 31:37.814
YOU'VE COME BACK!

31:44.946 --> 31:47.949
THIS AIN'T EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

31:48.116 --> 31:50.535
JONATHAN?

31:52.203 --> 31:53.621
I AIN'T
CHANGED MY MIND.

31:53.788 --> 31:56.791
I--I JUST COULDN'T
LEAVE YOU WITH ALL
THAT WORK UNDONE.

31:56.958 --> 32:00.169
I COME BACK TO CLEAR
THE UPPER FIELD.

32:04.048 --> 32:06.551
I GOT CHORES
TO DO.

32:18.688 --> 32:22.567
JUST HOW MUCH
DO YOU PLAN TO PUT
THAT CHILD THROUGH?

32:22.734 --> 32:24.652
ALICE, I--I--

32:24.819 --> 32:27.905
WHATEVER YOUR REASON
IS FOR COMING BACK,
YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT.

32:28.072 --> 32:31.618
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE
AND YOUR LAND EVERY BIT
AS MUCH AS IT IS MINE,

32:31.784 --> 32:35.455
BUT I WANT YOU KNOW
THAT ONCE THAT JUDGE
GETS HERE,

32:35.622 --> 32:37.540
IT'S ALL OVER
BETWEEN US,

32:37.707 --> 32:40.126
FOR ALL TIME TO COME.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.027
ARE YOU
FALLING ASLEEP?

33:06.194 --> 33:07.278
NO.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.155
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:09.322 --> 33:11.074
I DON'T KNOW.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.743
LIKE DREAMING,
I GUESS.

33:13.910 --> 33:17.372
I WAS JUST THINKING
I COULD OPEN MY EYES

33:17.538 --> 33:19.248
AND EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED

33:19.415 --> 33:21.125
WOULD JUST BE
A DREAM.

33:21.292 --> 33:22.794
MA AND PA WOULD BE

33:22.960 --> 33:24.379
BACK TOGETHER
AGAIN, AND...

33:24.545 --> 33:28.132
WHY DID ALL THIS
HAPPEN, ANYWAYS?

33:28.299 --> 33:30.301
I DON'T KNOW, ANDY.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.303
NOBODY KNOWS.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.056
EVEN MY MA AND PA
DON'T KNOW.

33:35.223 --> 33:37.433
ONE DAY EVERYTHING'S
GOOD AND LOVING,

33:37.600 --> 33:39.602
AND THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

33:39.769 --> 33:41.145
IT'S ALL OVER,

33:41.312 --> 33:43.439
AND NOBODY
KNOWS WHY.

33:45.525 --> 33:47.151
AT LEAST
WHEN KIDS FIGHT,

33:47.318 --> 33:48.653
THEY KNOW
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.947
THEY GET IT OVER
WITH AND MAKE UP.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.741
I THINK GOD DID
THINGS BACKWARDS.

33:53.908 --> 33:57.078
KIDS SHOULD GET MARRIED
AND HAVE PARENTS.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.845
MM-HMM.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.639
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH
HAVING A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.182
I END UP SPENDING
THE WHOLE NIGHT

34:18.349 --> 34:19.976
STANDING HERE LIKE A STATUE
WHILE YOU FIT ME WITH

34:20.143 --> 34:21.811
NEW CLOTHES I DON'T NEED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.855
HUSH NOW.
IF I LEFT THIS
UP TO YOU,

34:24.021 --> 34:26.482
YOU'D GO TO CHURCH
IN YOUR LONG JOHNS.

34:26.649 --> 34:30.695
BE WORTH IT
JUST TO SEE THE LOOK
ON MRS. OLESON'S FACE.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.029
HA HA HA HA!

34:32.196 --> 34:35.241
Caroline:
YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE
YOU'D DO IT.

34:35.408 --> 34:36.909
I'M FINISHED NOW.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.662
OH, GOOD.
THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.836
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.797
GLAD TO SEE YOU GOT
SOME MATERIAL FOR
A NEW DRESS FOR YOURSELF.

34:49.964 --> 34:52.925
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
FOR ANOTHER SHIRT
FOR YOU.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.469
FOR ME?

34:54.635 --> 34:58.055
YES. IT'S A VERY
GOOD PIECE OF GOODS.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.057
WELL, NOT FOR ME,
IT ISN'T.

35:00.224 --> 35:03.227
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
CATCH ME WALKING AROUND
WITH THAT ON.

35:03.394 --> 35:05.563
LAND'S SAKES,
WHY NOT?

35:05.730 --> 35:07.398
COME ON, CAROLINE.
I MEAN,

35:07.565 --> 35:09.901
THAT'S PRETTY SISSY-LOOKING
MATERIAL THERE.

35:10.067 --> 35:11.152
IT IS NOT.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.654
IT IS TOO. I'M NOT
GOING TO WEAR THAT.

35:13.821 --> 35:15.782
WELL...
JUST SHOWS WHAT I GET

35:15.948 --> 35:18.993
FOR TRYING TO FIND
SOMETHING REALLY NICE
FOR YOU.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.828
STOP IT!

35:20.995 --> 35:23.623
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

35:23.790 --> 35:25.458
LAURA,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

35:25.625 --> 35:27.668
I DON'T WANT YOU
FIGHTING.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.754
BABY, WE WEREN'T
FIGHTING.

35:29.921 --> 35:31.172
YOU WERE!

35:31.339 --> 35:33.216
DARLING, WE WERE JUST
HAVING A DISAGREEMENT.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.717
NO, YOU WEREN'T.
YOU WERE FIGHTING

35:34.884 --> 35:36.552
JUST LIKE
MR. AND MRS. GARVEY,

35:36.719 --> 35:37.845
AND NOW THEY'RE
GETTING DIVORCED

35:38.012 --> 35:40.556
AND WON'T EVEN TALK
TO EACH OTHER.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.141
OH, LAURA!

35:42.308 --> 35:43.518
HONEY.

35:43.684 --> 35:46.979
HEY, HEY, HEY.
COME ON.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.941
COME ON, HONEY. YOU DON'T
THINK YOUR MA AND I WOULD--

35:50.107 --> 35:51.734
I CAN'T HELP IT.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.736
IT JUST
SOUNDED LIKE...

35:53.903 --> 35:58.950
WELL, LOOK, YOU HAVE
DISAGREEMENTS WITH
YOUR SISTERS, DON'T YOU?

35:59.116 --> 36:00.451
YEAH.

36:00.618 --> 36:02.912
AND SOMETIMES
WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE
DISAGREEMENTS,

36:03.079 --> 36:05.331
YOU END UP GETTING
YOUR OWN WAY, DON'T YOU?

36:05.498 --> 36:06.666
YEAH.

36:06.833 --> 36:09.710
IT'S JUST THE SAME WITH
MA AND ME, THAT'S ALL.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.796
I MEAN, IF YOUR MA
KEPT IT UP LONG ENOUGH,

36:11.963 --> 36:13.631
I'D END UP GIVING IN.

36:13.798 --> 36:16.300
MATTER OF FACT,
TO PROVE MY POINT,
I WILL GIVE IN.

36:16.467 --> 36:19.679
CAROLINE,
YOU GO AHEAD AND YOU
MAKE THE NEW SHIRT.

36:19.846 --> 36:21.389
OH, CHARLES...

36:21.556 --> 36:23.641
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
WEAR IT, ANYWAY.

36:23.808 --> 36:25.101
OH!

36:25.268 --> 36:26.644
HA HA!

36:26.811 --> 36:27.979
HA HA HA!

36:28.145 --> 36:29.897
HA HA HA!

36:46.122 --> 36:49.500
UH, I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE DOWN AT
THE POST OFFICE.

36:49.667 --> 36:52.336
I ONLY WORK
HALF A DAY WEDNESDAYS.

36:52.503 --> 36:53.838
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

36:54.005 --> 36:57.550
IT GIVES YOU
A CHANCE TO CATCH UP
ON A WOMAN'S WORK.

36:58.801 --> 37:00.970
MUST BE KIND OF HARD
WORKING ALL DAY

37:01.137 --> 37:03.556
AND HAVING TO COME
HOME AND DO THIS.

37:03.723 --> 37:05.808
IT WAS NEVER EASY.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.604
DIDN'T SAY IT WAS.

37:09.770 --> 37:10.938
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

37:11.105 --> 37:13.065
DIDN'T HAVE TO WHAT?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.026
NEVER MIND.

37:17.778 --> 37:20.197
UPPER FIELD WILL BE
CLEARED PRETTY QUICK.

37:20.364 --> 37:21.699
THAT'S NICE.

37:21.866 --> 37:25.828
GOING TO MAKE
THIS PROPERTY WORTH
A LOT MORE.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.664
I'M SURE IT WILL.

37:28.831 --> 37:32.168
HARD WORK, THOUGH--
DRAGGING THEM
STUMPS AROUND.

37:34.128 --> 37:35.713
I'M SURE IT IS.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.508
MAN'S WORK.
REAL MAN'S WORK.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.763
GLAD THERE'S
SOMETHING I CAN DO
THAT YOU CAN'T.

37:45.556 --> 37:47.224
IF I WAS CLEARING
THE FIELD,

37:47.391 --> 37:50.311
I'D USE THE TEAM
WE USED TO HAVE.

38:21.926 --> 38:25.262
AMAZING HOW MUCH
YOU CLEARED
IN SO SHORT A TIME.

38:25.429 --> 38:27.431
YEAH.

38:27.598 --> 38:30.893
GOING TO BE A FINE
PIECE OF FARMLAND.

38:31.060 --> 38:33.270
AS SOON AS
I START WORKING,

38:33.437 --> 38:35.272
I'M GOING TO
SEND YOU SOME MONEY,

38:35.439 --> 38:38.067
AND YOU CAN REPLACE
THEM HORSES I SOLD.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.444
JONATHAN, YOU'RE LEAVING
EVERYTHING BEHIND.

38:40.611 --> 38:43.280
THERE'S NO NEED
TO SEND MONEY BESIDES.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.866
NO. IT'S RIGHT
AND PROPER.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.786
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.454
BEEN MAKING GOOD TIME.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.040
GOT A COUPLE MORE
OF THEM SCRUB TREES,

38:53.207 --> 38:56.460
AND I'LL BE THROUGH,
MAYBE EVEN TODAY.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.630
GOOD.

39:07.972 --> 39:11.392
THE STAGE
BROUGHT A LETTER FROM
JUDGE PICKER TODAY.

39:11.559 --> 39:13.894
HE'LL BE HERE
TOMORROW AT NOON.

39:14.061 --> 39:17.398
JUDGE WORKING
ON SATURDAY, HUH?

39:20.693 --> 39:23.571
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET
AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE.

39:25.698 --> 39:27.616
I'LL BE THERE.

39:32.747 --> 39:35.041
UH, WE NEEDED
TWO WITNESSES.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.710
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
BUT I ASKED THE INGALLS.

39:37.877 --> 39:43.716
NO, I...IF IT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH THEM,
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

39:48.345 --> 39:50.431
WELL, DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING?

39:52.767 --> 39:54.393
NEED ANYTHING?

39:56.479 --> 39:58.481
FROM THE HOUSE.

40:01.567 --> 40:05.821
NO, I...DON'T GUESS
THAT I DO.

40:10.117 --> 40:13.120
WELL, THEN,
I WON'T HOLD YOU UP.

40:29.178 --> 40:31.430
[PLAYING HARMONICA]

40:40.439 --> 40:41.816
[DOOR OPENS]

40:43.651 --> 40:45.111
[DOOR CLOSES]

40:56.997 --> 40:59.542
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

41:23.983 --> 41:25.442
WHO ARE THE GARVEYS?

41:25.609 --> 41:27.945
WE ARE,
YOUR HONOR.

41:29.238 --> 41:31.782
I AM JUDGE PICKER.

41:34.243 --> 41:36.120
YOU ARE THE WITNESSES?

41:36.287 --> 41:37.830
YES, SIR.

41:37.997 --> 41:39.123
Judge: NAME?

41:39.290 --> 41:41.083
INGALLS.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.877
ONE "L" OR TWO?

41:43.043 --> 41:45.963
TWO. CHARLES
AND CAROLINE.

41:48.632 --> 41:50.384
AND WHO MIGHT THIS BE?

41:50.551 --> 41:53.179
OUR SON ANDREW.

41:53.345 --> 41:56.432
Judge: "SON, ANDREW."

41:57.850 --> 42:01.979
NOW, THEN, I WILL
ASSUME THAT, AS USUAL,

42:02.146 --> 42:05.107
THERE ARE QUESTIONS
OF PROPERTY AND OTHER
FINANCIAL MATTERS

42:05.274 --> 42:07.735
WHICH ARE NOT YET
SETTLED BETWEEN YOU.

42:07.902 --> 42:09.653
I WILL STATE CATEGORICALLY

42:09.820 --> 42:13.407
THAT UNLESS THEY ARE SETTLED
HERE AND NOW IN MY PRESENCE

42:13.574 --> 42:16.243
AND TO THE SATISFACTION
OF ALL PARTIES,

42:16.410 --> 42:18.913
YOU WILL NEED TO ENGAGE
SEPARATE ATTORNEYS

42:19.079 --> 42:21.248
AND GO FIGHT IT OUT
IN MINNEAPOLIS.

42:21.415 --> 42:22.917
IS THAT CLEAR?

42:23.083 --> 42:24.877
YES, YOUR HONOR.

42:25.044 --> 42:27.296
THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE
PROPOSITION,

42:27.463 --> 42:31.342
SO I SUGGEST YOU CONSIDER IT
WHEN EITHER OR BOTH OF YOU

42:31.508 --> 42:34.428
ARE TEMPTED TO SUCCUMB
TO UNREASONABLENESS.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.639
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT,
YOUR HONOR.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.183
WE AIN'T
UNREASONABLE PEOPLE.

42:39.350 --> 42:42.353
SOMEBODY MUST BE.
YOU'RE GETTING DIVORCED.

42:42.519 --> 42:46.732
YOUR HONOR,
I CAN PROMISE YOU
THERE'S NO PROBLEM

42:46.899 --> 42:49.193
CONCERNING MONEY
OR PROPERTY.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.362
IS THAT SO?

42:52.571 --> 42:54.281
I'LL GO ALONG
WITH WHATEVER

42:54.448 --> 42:56.492
MY HUSBAND
THINKS IS FAIR.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.787
MOST UNUSUAL.

42:59.954 --> 43:05.167
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS
NOT RESOLVED BETWEEN YOU?

43:05.334 --> 43:07.670
Alice:
YES. ONE THING.

43:07.836 --> 43:09.213
Judge: AND THAT IS?

43:09.380 --> 43:11.298
THE CUSTODY OF OUR SON.

43:11.465 --> 43:13.217
ALICE, I AIN'T
NEVER SAID--

43:13.384 --> 43:15.386
JONATHAN, HE WANTS
TO LIVE WITH YOU.

43:15.552 --> 43:16.887
THAT'S
PLUMB CRAZY.

43:17.054 --> 43:20.766
I'VE AGREED
SO LONG AS YOU REMAIN
IN WALNUT GROVE.

43:20.933 --> 43:23.018
YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DO THAT.

43:23.185 --> 43:24.979
SURE YOU CAN, PA.

43:25.145 --> 43:26.897
YOU SAW HOW NICE

43:27.064 --> 43:29.400
I FIXED UP
THE CABIN FOR YOU,

43:29.566 --> 43:33.028
AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO LOOK AFTER YOU.

43:33.195 --> 43:34.947
I CAN DO IT.

43:35.114 --> 43:36.365
HONEST, I CAN.

43:36.532 --> 43:38.909
I KNOW YOU DID
A FINE JOB

43:39.076 --> 43:40.494
WITH THAT
CABIN, SON,

43:40.661 --> 43:42.705
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MA?

43:44.081 --> 43:47.251
I CAN VISIT HER
ANYTIME I WANT.

43:47.418 --> 43:49.336
IT'LL BE
THE NEXT BEST THING

43:49.503 --> 43:51.380
TO STILL BEING
A FAMILY.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.883
EVEN IF YOU HATE
EACH OTHER,

43:55.050 --> 43:59.221
THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T LOVE BOTH OF YOU.

43:59.388 --> 44:03.017
I DON'T HATE
YOUR MA, BOY.

44:03.183 --> 44:06.895
THEN...WHY ARE YOU
GETTING A DIVORCE?

44:08.605 --> 44:10.691
ASK YOUR MOTHER.

44:12.234 --> 44:14.361
WHY, MA?

44:17.489 --> 44:18.615
OH...

44:18.782 --> 44:21.744
TELL HIM
IT'S BECAUSE
I'M A FAILURE.

44:21.910 --> 44:23.495
I--I'M USELESS.

44:23.662 --> 44:26.498
A MAN CAN'T PROVIDE
FOR HIS FAMILY,

44:26.665 --> 44:29.668
HE AIN'T
GOT NO RIGHT
TO BE HUSBAND.

44:29.835 --> 44:31.795
I NEVER SAID THAT.

44:31.962 --> 44:34.590
I NEVER EVEN HINTED THAT
I SEE YOU THAT WAY.

44:34.757 --> 44:36.133
DID TOO.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.468
WHEN?

44:37.634 --> 44:38.677
LOTS OF TIMES.

44:38.844 --> 44:39.678
WHEN?

44:39.845 --> 44:41.430
YOU TELLING ME
I DIDN'T HEAR

44:41.597 --> 44:43.057
THOSE
ACCUSING THINGS
YOU SAID TO ME?

44:43.223 --> 44:46.226
NO, I'M NOT.
I BELIEVE YOU HEARD THEM.

44:46.393 --> 44:47.728
I JUST NEVER SAID THEM.

44:47.895 --> 44:49.146
I THINK YOU
BLOCK OUT MY VOICE

44:49.313 --> 44:51.190
AND PUT IN A VOICE
FROM YOUR OWN HEAD!

44:51.357 --> 44:53.942
THAT'S REALLY GREAT.
NOW YOU'RE TELLING
ME I'M CRAZY.

44:54.109 --> 44:56.070
THERE, YOU SEE?
I NEVER SAID YOU'RE CRAZY.

44:56.236 --> 44:57.821
YOU JUST SAID
I SAID YOU WERE CRAZY.

44:57.988 --> 44:58.822
I DIDN'T.

44:58.989 --> 44:59.823
YOU DID TOO!

44:59.990 --> 45:00.991
I SAID <i>YOU</i> SAID!

45:01.158 --> 45:03.660
I SAID THAT YOU NEVER
HEAR WHAT I SAY!

45:03.827 --> 45:05.329
WELL, I'M HEARING
YOU NOW.

45:05.496 --> 45:06.997
THEN WHAT DID I SAY?

45:07.164 --> 45:08.415
YOU SAID I'M CRAZY.

45:08.582 --> 45:11.418
Charles:
HA HA HA HA!

45:11.585 --> 45:12.753
HA HA HA!

45:12.920 --> 45:14.546
CHARLES, I DON'T SEE
NOTHING FUNNY.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.965
I'M SORRY.
HA HA HA!

45:17.132 --> 45:19.635
YOU BETTER TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING.

45:19.802 --> 45:21.136
HA HA HA!

45:21.303 --> 45:22.137
HE SAYS...

45:22.304 --> 45:24.765
HE SAYS THAT
SHE SAYS THAT--

45:24.932 --> 45:27.017
SHE DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE CRAZY.

45:27.184 --> 45:28.811
<i>YOU</i> SAID
YOU WERE CRAZY.

45:28.977 --> 45:30.729
WELL,
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

45:30.896 --> 45:32.815
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE SAID.

45:32.981 --> 45:33.899
HA HA HA HA!

45:34.066 --> 45:35.818
WHAT <i>DID</i> YOU SAY?

45:35.984 --> 45:38.237
[CHARLES LAUGHING]

45:38.404 --> 45:40.072
[BOTH LAUGHING]

45:59.800 --> 46:02.010
OH, JONATHAN!

46:14.064 --> 46:18.861
I WANT YOU ALL
TO TRY TO BE VERY CALM.

46:26.702 --> 46:28.745
I WOULD ONLY
LIKE TO KNOW,

46:28.912 --> 46:32.207
ARE WE OR ARE WE NOT
GETTING A DIVORCE?

46:32.374 --> 46:34.877
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU?

46:40.424 --> 46:45.971
MR. GARVEY, I'M GOING TO CONCUR
WITH THE GENERAL CONSENSUS.

46:46.138 --> 46:49.266
YOUR WIFE DID NOT
TELL YOU YOU'RE CRAZY...

46:49.433 --> 46:51.435
BUT I <i>AM.</i>

46:55.272 --> 46:58.567
I'M TELLING ALL OF YOU--
YOU'RE CRAZY!

47:05.365 --> 47:07.284
CAN WE GO
HOME NOW, PA?

47:08.577 --> 47:10.537
I DON'T SEE
WHY NOT.

47:10.704 --> 47:12.206
COME ON.

47:19.379 --> 47:21.632
JUST A MINUTE.

47:21.798 --> 47:22.841
UH, CHARLES.

47:23.008 --> 47:24.384
CHARLES!

47:24.551 --> 47:26.803
CAN WE GET YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY TO JOIN US
FOR DINNER TONIGHT?

47:26.970 --> 47:27.888
HA HA HA!

47:28.055 --> 47:29.264
WE'D LOVE TO.

47:29.431 --> 47:33.769
I'LL--I'LL BRING
A CASSEROLE.

47:33.936 --> 47:34.853
NO NEED.

47:35.020 --> 47:36.605
WE'RE GOING TO EAT
HIGH OFF THE HOG

47:36.772 --> 47:40.150
IF I CAN GET MY WIFE
TO SPEND SOME OF
HER POST OFFICE MONEY.

47:40.317 --> 47:41.443
I'LL SEE YOU.

47:41.610 --> 47:42.986
Charles: WE'LL SEE YOU.

47:43.153 --> 47:43.946
OH!

47:44.112 --> 47:45.155
OH! HA HA!

47:45.322 --> 47:48.242
THAT WAS THE MOST
AMAZING THING.

47:48.408 --> 47:49.618
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

47:49.785 --> 47:51.703
THAT WAS THE MOST
AMAZING THING.

47:51.870 --> 47:53.330
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT.

47:53.497 --> 47:54.957
YOU SAID
I WAS CRAZY.

47:55.123 --> 47:56.583
OH, CHARLES!
