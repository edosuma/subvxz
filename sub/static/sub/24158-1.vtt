00:25.542 --> 00:27.917
What a real playwright
has to do

00:27.917 --> 00:30.458
is to say to the audience,
in effect,

00:30.458 --> 00:33.583
"This is what you think...

00:33.583 --> 00:36.750
you're seeing in life
every day,"

00:36.750 --> 00:38.917
and then to turn it around
and say,

00:38.917 --> 00:40.583
"This is what it really is."

00:43.959 --> 00:46.250
Imagine if we knew the truth.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.709
Man:
That's a very lovely thought,
all right.

00:48.709 --> 00:50.041
That would be great thing.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.291
And once, sometimes,
in a lifetime,

00:52.291 --> 00:54.792
a playwright
can get at it, really.

01:02.250 --> 01:04.291
Man: Playwright Arthur Miller
has received

01:04.291 --> 01:06.625
virtually every artistic award
which denotes

01:06.625 --> 01:08.625
distinction,
creativity, and acclaim.

01:08.625 --> 01:11.208
Man 2:
A great deal of publicity
attended Arthur Miller.

01:11.208 --> 01:13.125
Dick Cavett: ...with a giant
of the American theater--

01:13.125 --> 01:14.875
Arthur Miller.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.458
Rebecca Miller:
My father had become

01:18.458 --> 01:22.125
a national icon of the theater
decades before I was born.

01:22.125 --> 01:25.000
He had lived through
so many different eras,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.959
almost like
different lifetimes.

01:27.959 --> 01:30.667
Man 4: Why did you refuse
the invitation

01:30.667 --> 01:32.291
of President Johnson?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.375
Man 5: Are you a member
of the Communist Party

01:41.375 --> 01:43.000
or have you ever been

01:43.000 --> 01:45.333
a member
of the Communist Party?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.917
Rebecca: Early on,
I recognized

01:47.917 --> 01:50.583
that his public persona
was so different

01:50.583 --> 01:53.000
from the man I knew,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.542
and I felt I was
the only filmmaker

01:56.542 --> 01:58.792
that he would let close enough

01:58.792 --> 02:01.458
to really see
what he was like.

02:01.458 --> 02:04.333
So I started doing interviews
with him

02:04.333 --> 02:06.709
and his siblings, friends,

02:06.709 --> 02:09.333
taking a lot of home footage

02:09.333 --> 02:12.375
and gathering old movies
and photos,

02:12.375 --> 02:14.875
over a period
of about 20 years.

02:14.875 --> 02:18.041
And all that footage
sat in storage

02:18.041 --> 02:21.625
for quite a long time,
until I decided

02:21.625 --> 02:23.875
it should be shut away
no longer.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.750
Rebecca: Have you decided on
what to wear?

02:31.750 --> 02:34.291
Arthur Miller: Well,
you sort of decided for me.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.375
It's what I wore all week.

02:53.542 --> 02:56.750
I got up and I sat down,
and I'm just breathless.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.792
Rebecca:
OK, Pop!

03:18.083 --> 03:20.917
Miller:
All those goddamn angles
drive you crazy.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.000
Rebecca: Dad, do you think
there are any similarities

03:26.000 --> 03:29.125
between building furniture
and writing plays?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.917
The way I look at it, it's...

03:31.917 --> 03:34.000
there are forces
that want to break out,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.792
and forces that want
to contract.

03:36.792 --> 03:40.291
And if you've got
a sense of form,

03:40.291 --> 03:44.375
you can make that projectile
on stage...

03:44.375 --> 03:48.750
move like a living...thing.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.834
And move people with it.

03:52.834 --> 03:56.542
If it just lies there...
motionless,

03:56.542 --> 03:59.125
it means
that some of the forces in it

03:59.125 --> 04:01.375
haven't been captured.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.625
Or you haven't evoked them.

04:11.375 --> 04:14.834
Did your father like to eat
as much as you do?

04:14.834 --> 04:17.834
Some restaurants,
they loved him,

04:17.834 --> 04:19.834
so they'd never
let him pay.

04:19.834 --> 04:22.875
I went into one restaurant
in those years,

04:22.875 --> 04:25.208
twenty-five years ago,

04:25.208 --> 04:27.375
sat down, had a little lunch,

04:27.375 --> 04:30.542
waiter came over to me
and said--

04:30.542 --> 04:32.458
leaned over the table
and said,

04:32.458 --> 04:35.000
"Your father
was a better dresser."

04:37.166 --> 04:41.458
Miller: My father had arrived
in New York all alone,

04:41.458 --> 04:43.000
from the middle of Poland,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.875
before his seventh birthday.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.959
Came here alone

04:47.959 --> 04:52.375
with a tag on his...coat.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.208
And his family was here.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.875
But why--I never
understood why,

04:55.875 --> 04:58.583
how  they could have done that.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.959
I think they must have thought
there was something wrong
with him.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.250
Miller:
He used to say that

05:02.250 --> 05:05.375
he would always
be sleeping with idiots.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.583
And I have the feeling
that he may have been

05:08.583 --> 05:10.458
in some kind of an institution.

05:10.458 --> 05:13.250
Rebecca: You think that they
thought there was something--

05:13.250 --> 05:14.750
Yeah.

05:14.750 --> 05:19.250
I can't imagine them
leaving him here otherwise.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.291
Rebecca:
You mean in Poland?

05:21.291 --> 05:22.750
Miller:
Yeah, I think he's right.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.375
Miller:
He arrived in New York.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.333
His parents were too busy
to pick him up

05:26.333 --> 05:27.709
at Castle Garden,

05:27.709 --> 05:30.125
and sent his next-eldest
brother Abe,

05:30.125 --> 05:32.583
going on 10,
to find him,

05:32.583 --> 05:34.583
get him through Immigration,

05:34.583 --> 05:36.083
and bring him home
to Stanton Street

05:36.083 --> 05:38.959
and a tenement where,
in two rooms,

05:38.959 --> 05:40.792
the eight of them lived
and worked,

05:40.792 --> 05:44.083
sewing the great, long,
many-buttoned cloaks

05:44.083 --> 05:45.917
that were the fashion then.

05:47.375 --> 05:51.417
They sent him to school
for about six months.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.125
Figured he had enough.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.959
He never learned how to spell,
he never learned how to figure,

05:55.959 --> 05:58.250
then he went right back
into the shop.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.625
By the time he was twelve,

06:00.625 --> 06:02.750
he himself was employing
two other boys

06:02.750 --> 06:05.583
to sew sleeves on coats
alongside him

06:05.583 --> 06:07.500
in some basement workshop.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.083
Kermit:
He went on the road,

06:09.083 --> 06:12.041
when he was about 16,
as a--

06:12.041 --> 06:14.834
selling at a wholesale level.

06:14.834 --> 06:18.125
He ended up being the support
of the entire family,

06:18.125 --> 06:21.792
because he started a business
in 1921 or something,

06:21.792 --> 06:26.041
the Miltex Coat Company,
which turned out to be

06:26.041 --> 06:29.792
one of the largest
manufacturers in this country.

06:29.792 --> 06:33.000
See, we lived in Manhattan
then...

06:33.000 --> 06:35.583
on 110th Street,
facing the park.

06:35.583 --> 06:39.166
It was a beautiful apartment
up on the sixth floor.

06:39.166 --> 06:44.625
We had a chauffeur-driven car;
the family was well fixed.

06:44.625 --> 06:48.000
It was the '20s,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.667
and I remember our mother
and father

06:50.667 --> 06:54.000
going to a show
every weekend

06:54.000 --> 06:57.291
and coming back Sunday morning.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.166
She would be playing
the sheet music

07:00.166 --> 07:01.709
of the musicals.

07:01.709 --> 07:04.333
And we would fight about
who was going to sing with her.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.875
Or who wasn't
going to sing with her.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.333
And who wasn't
going to sing with her.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.542
Generally, he wasn't
going to sing.

07:11.542 --> 07:16.917
♪ I'm gonna sit right down
and write myself a letter ♪

07:16.917 --> 07:20.834
♪ And make believe
it came from you ♪

07:20.834 --> 07:22.917
Rebecca: That's nice.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.250
♪ Bah-bah bah bah
bah-bah-bah ♪

07:25.250 --> 07:27.834
♪ Da deedle-ee
doo-doo doo-doo ♪

07:29.667 --> 07:31.834
Dad, what does this
remind you of?

07:31.834 --> 07:33.041
It reminds me of...

07:45.125 --> 07:48.500
Miller: You know,
she could read a novel

07:48.500 --> 07:50.291
in an afternoon.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.959
She was the fastest reader

07:51.959 --> 07:54.875
I have ever met in my life.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.458
Not only that,
but she'd remember it

07:57.458 --> 07:59.083
for the rest of her life.

07:59.083 --> 08:03.667
Well, she was a very complicated
woman, very complex.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.792
She had the energy of a dynamo.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.083
She could sing,
she could play the piano...

08:08.083 --> 08:10.083
She could be quite flamboyant.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.291
She used to dance on the table
New Year's Eve.

08:12.291 --> 08:15.750
She could draw, she could--
she was a helluva bridge player.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.208
- She was funny.
- Very bitchy.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.083
She had an attitude
about most things.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.291
Rebecca: But you kept kosher
when you cooked?

08:24.291 --> 08:27.709
Well, yeah.
Till she started
making bacon.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.083
She loved bacon.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.582
I think she tried to
rule and divide the kids.

08:32.582 --> 08:35.833
See, I always considered myself
the favorite.

08:35.833 --> 08:38.708
Rebecca: Who was
your mother's favorite?

08:38.708 --> 08:40.708
Miller:
Yeah, I think I was.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.083
I would, for example,
if I didn't want
to go to school,

08:48.083 --> 08:49.667
I'd start limping around.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.291
My mother
immediately caught on,
and she said,

08:52.291 --> 08:54.250
"You don't have
to go school today,

08:54.250 --> 08:55.917
you're limping."

08:58.500 --> 09:02.041
And we'd both
go to some place
and have oysters.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.125
Rebecca: But your mother,

09:05.125 --> 09:08.000
you said that she saw portents
in a lot of things, right?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.792
She saw signs.

09:09.792 --> 09:15.792
She saw...mysterious things
in the air from time to time.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.792
She'd have feelings
from people.

09:17.792 --> 09:20.583
She once sat up in bed
in the middle of the night,

09:20.583 --> 09:23.834
she suddenly said,
"My mother died."

09:23.834 --> 09:26.750
And indeed, at that moment,
her mother had died.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.458
It was spooky.

09:28.458 --> 09:30.834
How you you think that
it translated into you,
though?

09:30.834 --> 09:34.458
Well, I used to think
that the way that a play

09:34.458 --> 09:36.625
was not about
what was spoken,

09:36.625 --> 09:40.125
but was between
the spoken lines.

09:40.125 --> 09:45.625
That the world, essentially,
is not what we call "real."

09:45.625 --> 09:50.959
And these arts are attempting
to approach that world.

09:52.792 --> 09:56.959
And it all comes
from my mother.

09:56.959 --> 10:00.125
You know, in my case,
it's always coming
from somewhere.

10:00.125 --> 10:02.083
She was that way.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.667
She idolized artists,

10:04.667 --> 10:07.792
pianists, writers, and so on.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.834
My father had no knowledge
of any of that.

10:09.834 --> 10:13.458
Fran: And it was
an arranged marriage.

10:13.458 --> 10:17.792
For a woman of her ability
to be married off

10:17.792 --> 10:20.667
to a man
who couldn't read or write--

10:20.667 --> 10:23.291
I think Gussie
taught him now to read,

10:23.291 --> 10:24.834
and then to sign his name.

10:24.834 --> 10:29.333
Miller: She knew she was
being wasted, I think.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.041
But she respected him a lot,

10:32.041 --> 10:34.375
and that made up for a lot.

10:34.375 --> 10:38.375
Until he really crashed
economically--

10:38.375 --> 10:40.458
she got angry then.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.083
Newsman:
These tremendous crowds

10:42.083 --> 10:45.083
which you see gathered
outside the Stock Exchange,

10:45.083 --> 10:46.542
are due to the greatest crash

10:46.542 --> 10:49.000
in the history
of the New York Stock Exchange.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.542
Miller: First,
the chauffer was let go

10:50.542 --> 10:53.125
and the summer bungalow
was discarded,

10:53.125 --> 10:57.041
the last of her jewelry
had been pawned or sold--

10:57.041 --> 11:01.417
and then another step down:
the move to Brooklyn.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.583
Not just the case of my father,

11:06.583 --> 11:08.834
but every boy I knew.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.125
I used to pal around
with half a dozen guys,

11:11.125 --> 11:14.875
and all their fathers
were simply blown out
of the water.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.625
The whole family orbit
changed.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.250
It was--it was painful.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.458
Miller: I could not avoid
awareness of my mother's anger

11:26.458 --> 11:28.792
at this waning of his powers.

11:28.792 --> 11:31.583
A certain sneering contempt
for him

11:31.583 --> 11:33.875
had filtered through her voice.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.166
Rebecca: So how did the way
you saw your father change

11:38.166 --> 11:40.333
when he lost his money?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.583
Terrible pity for him.

11:42.583 --> 11:45.417
So much of his authority
sprang from the fact

11:45.417 --> 11:49.583
that he was a very successful
businessman.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.250
And he always knew
what he was doing.

11:52.250 --> 11:55.917
And suddenly...nothin'.

11:55.917 --> 11:59.041
He didn't know where he was.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.458
It was absolutely
not his fault,

12:01.458 --> 12:06.041
it was the Great Crash
of the '29, '30, '31 period.

12:06.041 --> 12:09.125
So from that,
I always, I think,

12:09.125 --> 12:14.959
contracted the idea
that we're very deeply immersed

12:14.959 --> 12:17.917
in the political and economic
life of the country,

12:17.917 --> 12:19.500
and of the world.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.333
And that these forces
end up in the bedroom.

12:23.333 --> 12:26.417
Then they end up in
the father-and-son

12:26.417 --> 12:29.125
and father-and-daughter
arrangements.

12:29.125 --> 12:32.208
Younger Miller:
In "Death of a Salesman,"

12:32.208 --> 12:34.500
what I was interested in there

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
was what his world

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
and what his life

12:38.500 --> 12:40.542
had left him with,

12:40.542 --> 12:42.667
what it had done to him.

12:42.667 --> 12:46.458
Older Miller:
A guy can't make a living,
he loses his dignity.

12:46.458 --> 12:49.834
Loses his male force.

12:49.834 --> 12:52.667
And so you tend
to make up for it

12:52.667 --> 12:56.333
by telling him he's OK anyway.

12:56.333 --> 13:00.500
Or else you turn your back
on him and leave.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.667
All of which

13:01.667 --> 13:05.250
helps create integrated plays,

13:05.250 --> 13:07.667
incidentally.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.583
When you begin to look, well,

13:10.583 --> 13:13.709
it's a personality here,

13:13.709 --> 13:18.125
but what part is being played
by impersonal forces?

13:18.125 --> 13:21.625
Miller:
I got through high school.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.917
I'd had such a miserable record

13:23.917 --> 13:26.000
that I couldn't get into
a decent university.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.792
So I went to work
on a full-time basis.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.208
Rebecca: Weren't you a waiter
in the Catskills?

13:32.208 --> 13:34.375
I sure was.
I was the worst waiter.

13:34.375 --> 13:37.709
It was the most elegant hotel
in the Catskills,

13:37.709 --> 13:42.542
and the help was given food
that had rotted.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.709
So we used to steal food

13:44.709 --> 13:47.333
on the way out of the kitchen
into the dining room.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.959
Somebody ordered
two lamb chops,

13:49.959 --> 13:53.709
you went into the kitchen
and you ordered three.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.041
Go...

13:58.500 --> 14:00.834
Finally I landed
a helluva good job

14:00.834 --> 14:02.625
in an automobile parts
warehouse.

14:02.625 --> 14:06.083
And I had an hour and a half
on the subway every morning.

14:06.083 --> 14:10.041
Then I started reading what
we used to call "thick books."

14:10.041 --> 14:12.333
I remember reading
Dostoyevsky once,

14:12.333 --> 14:15.250
I was staring into space
for weeks

14:15.250 --> 14:18.583
thinking a human being
could write that.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.917
So I saved up $500,

14:20.917 --> 14:23.583
and after much pleading,
the University of Michigan

14:23.583 --> 14:26.750
decided to put me on
for six months.

14:26.750 --> 14:29.917
Rebecca:
But when you went to college,
Kermit didn't go.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.083
Miller:
He was the older son,
and the older son

14:32.083 --> 14:34.542
in the Jewish family,
or other families,

14:34.542 --> 14:35.917
is the one with
the responsibility.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.625
The younger son is just--

14:37.625 --> 14:40.959
nobody pays
much attention to him.

14:40.959 --> 14:43.583
He's just
coasting along.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.333
And Kermit had
that responsibility,

14:46.333 --> 14:48.667
which he took
very seriously.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.333
So as time went on,

14:51.333 --> 14:54.667
he became loaded with
the responsibility

14:54.667 --> 14:56.959
for the family business.

14:56.959 --> 14:59.083
I escaped, thank God.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.542
Miller:
I was gunning for
a Hopwood Award,

15:03.542 --> 15:05.792
which, at the University
of Michigan,

15:05.792 --> 15:08.667
was the student equivalent
of the Nobel.

15:08.667 --> 15:12.750
But I had two jobs
and a full academic schedule,

15:12.750 --> 15:15.667
and between dishwashing
three times a day

15:15.667 --> 15:18.166
and feeding
three floors of mice

15:18.166 --> 15:19.959
in a genetics laboratory

15:19.959 --> 15:21.917
in the woods
at the edge of town,

15:21.917 --> 15:25.667
I would fall into bed
each night exhausted.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.709
I decided to remain
in Ann Arbor

15:27.709 --> 15:30.542
rather than go home
for the spring vacation

15:30.542 --> 15:34.166
and to use the week
to write my play.

15:34.166 --> 15:38.333
Why it had to be a play,
rather than a story or a novel,

15:38.333 --> 15:40.291
I've never been sure.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.375
But it was like the difference
for an artist

15:42.375 --> 15:44.500
between a sculpture
and a drawing--

15:44.500 --> 15:46.625
it seemed more tangible.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.834
Younger Miller:
...that the theater
has a higher mission,

15:48.834 --> 15:51.667
has had, for two or three
thousand years,

15:51.667 --> 15:55.500
a civilizing impact on man,

15:55.500 --> 16:00.291
and that it remains yet,
as I said, the tribune

16:00.291 --> 16:03.959
where a citizen
such as myself

16:03.959 --> 16:06.875
may address quite plainly,
simply,

16:06.875 --> 16:10.083
and over empty air,
so to speak,

16:10.083 --> 16:12.000
his fellow citizens.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.417
Miller:
Working day and night

16:13.417 --> 16:15.375
with a few hours
of exhausted sleep

16:15.375 --> 16:17.375
sprinkled through the week,

16:17.375 --> 16:20.375
I finished the play
in five days.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.542
It was about
an industrial conflict

16:22.542 --> 16:24.458
and a father and his two sons,

16:24.458 --> 16:26.709
the most autobiographical
dramatic work

16:26.709 --> 16:28.375
I would ever write.

16:30.375 --> 16:32.041
You know,
the truth of the matter is

16:32.041 --> 16:34.333
that I never had an argument
with my father.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.667
That was part of
the problem, see,

16:36.667 --> 16:39.750
we could never come
to a fruitful conflict.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.917
So it took
my work to do that.

16:42.917 --> 16:46.583
From the beginning,
the idea of writing a play

16:46.583 --> 16:50.458
was a kind of license
to say the unspeakable.

16:50.458 --> 16:54.792
I had won the Hopwood--
$250--

16:54.792 --> 16:56.959
for one week's work.

16:56.959 --> 16:59.417
I was still accustomed
to thinking like a laborer.

16:59.417 --> 17:03.417
It had taken me two years
to save up the $500

17:03.417 --> 17:05.250
to come to Michigan.

17:07.916 --> 17:10.834
From the beginning,
writing meant freedom,

17:10.834 --> 17:12.625
the spreading of wings.

17:12.625 --> 17:15.250
I had never known
such exhilaration.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.416
It was as though
I had levitated

17:17.416 --> 17:20.083
and left the world below.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.625
Joan Copeland:
When he would have
come back from college,

17:24.625 --> 17:26.040
there was a change in him.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.458
He was beginning
to be his own man.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.917
He was beginning
to be Arthur Miller

17:31.917 --> 17:33.834
and not just
one of the Millers.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.542
Newscaster: Following
yesterday's unprovoked attack

17:36.542 --> 17:38.291
by the Japanese on Hawaii,

17:38.291 --> 17:39.959
the United States was at war.

17:41.917 --> 17:44.125
Newscaster 2: Adolph Hitler's
mechanized forces

17:44.125 --> 17:47.667
are racing toward Paris
as French resistance collapses.

17:50.959 --> 17:53.250
Miller:
He went into the army.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.709
He said to himself,
he said, "Kill me."

17:55.709 --> 17:58.250
Rebecca:
What happened to you
in the war?

17:58.250 --> 18:02.375
Well, I was drafted,
and then they looked
at my broken knee

18:02.375 --> 18:05.542
and they said,
"We don't want you.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.000
Go get an operation."

18:08.000 --> 18:10.542
So I said, "Why don't you guys
operate on me?"

18:10.542 --> 18:12.166
They said,
"We don't do that operation."

18:12.166 --> 18:14.750
I said, "Why?"
"It's too dangerous."

18:16.333 --> 18:20.083
By that time,
I was on my way
as a writer,

18:20.083 --> 18:22.917
writing scripts for radio.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.458
And I was married.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.125
Rebecca:
What was Mary like?

18:33.125 --> 18:37.500
She's a Catholic woman
raised in the Midwest

18:37.500 --> 18:40.625
who rebelled
against all of that.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.959
They were all Republicans,
she was a Democrat.

18:42.959 --> 18:44.291
She was a rebel.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.709
She didn't like
going to church,

18:45.709 --> 18:47.208
she stopped
as soon as she could,

18:47.208 --> 18:48.959
you know,
they were all devout.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.583
She moved to New York
with a Jew.

18:50.583 --> 18:52.500
Coming out of Michigan,

18:52.500 --> 18:54.834
New York was
her dream come true.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.500
Jane Miller:
I mean, she was literary,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.875
I mean, she read everything,

18:59.875 --> 19:02.041
and she worked in publishing.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.875
And they would go
to the theater a lot.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.041
They went to the theater
all the time.

19:10.291 --> 19:13.542
Jane Miller:
Did you get the feeling
that, you know,

19:13.542 --> 19:16.250
Dad had a weak spot
for being adored?

19:16.250 --> 19:20.166
Bob Miller: Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.500
Yeah, and I think Mom
was not somebody

19:22.500 --> 19:25.208
who did that gratuitously.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.291
She wasn't very demonstrative
in her affection.

19:30.417 --> 19:32.750
Jane: And you can see
in the letters to Mary

19:32.750 --> 19:35.750
that he's quite puppyish
with her,

19:35.750 --> 19:37.291
he really wants her approval

19:37.291 --> 19:39.083
and he wants to please her.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.375
Mike Wallace:
I knew you, of course,
a little,

20:00.375 --> 20:02.250
and I knew Mary
back at Ann Arbor.

20:02.250 --> 20:06.625
You and Mary seemed
an usual couple.

20:06.625 --> 20:09.083
Miller: That's part of what
attracted both of us.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.625
We were mysteries
to each other.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.667
She wanted the intellectual,
a Jew,

20:12.667 --> 20:14.792
the artist,

20:14.792 --> 20:17.792
and I wanted...America.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.792
Man: Opening in theaters
this week,

20:25.792 --> 20:27.834
"The Man Who Had
All the Luck"

20:27.834 --> 20:31.375
the Broadway debut of
Brooklyn's own Arthur Miller.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.208
Miller: The question
behind the play is

20:33.208 --> 20:35.375
how much of our lives we make

20:35.375 --> 20:38.625
and how much are made
by circumstance.

20:38.625 --> 20:43.500
It was about a young man
who lives in a small town

20:43.500 --> 20:45.709
in the Middle West.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.959
He can't seem
to do anything wrong.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.125
And he gradually
grows to fear

20:50.125 --> 20:55.083
that his fate is building up
a thundercloud

20:55.083 --> 20:57.375
which is going to strike him,

20:57.375 --> 21:00.291
and becomes quite paranoid.

21:02.208 --> 21:05.333
I guess I assumed
I was not gonna be attacked

21:05.333 --> 21:08.625
or destroyed or eaten alive.

21:14.959 --> 21:18.333
So that was my first
introduction to show business.

21:18.333 --> 21:22.333
I resolved after
the failure of "The Man
Who Had All the Luck"

21:22.333 --> 21:24.750
that I was never gonna write
another play.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.709
I didn't want to be
a 30-year-old
would-be playwright--

21:28.709 --> 21:31.625
there's so many other things
you can do with your life.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.875
She was the one
who was paying the rent,

21:34.875 --> 21:37.458
when "The Man Who Had
All the Luck" closed

21:37.458 --> 21:39.000
after six performances,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.875
and Dad sat down
to write "Focus"

21:40.875 --> 21:42.458
'cause he thought,
"Maybe I'm not a playwright,

21:42.458 --> 21:43.750
maybe I gotta pay the rent
somehow else."

21:43.750 --> 21:44.917
She got
the publisher

21:44.917 --> 21:46.375
she was
working with

21:46.375 --> 21:47.500
to publish it,

21:47.500 --> 21:48.917
after he'd shopped it around

21:48.917 --> 21:50.041
to some other places.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.333
Miller:
But what I did was,

21:53.333 --> 21:57.583
decide that I would write
a play one more time.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.375
This time I took
over two years to write it.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.875
Rebecca: Do you know
what kind of role she had

22:05.875 --> 22:08.792
in the development
of the writing?

22:08.792 --> 22:10.625
Bob: Yeah.
She had a big part in it.

22:10.625 --> 22:12.083
I think she'd read his stuff,

22:12.083 --> 22:13.834
I know that he showed her
all his stuff.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.125
And I know she was tough.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.667
I mean, I know that she,
you know,

22:16.667 --> 22:18.417
she would speak her mind

22:18.417 --> 22:20.208
and speak up about it.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.041
And I think it probably
served him well.

22:24.750 --> 22:28.291
Man: It's a play that comes out
right after the war,

22:28.291 --> 22:31.041
and there was nothing
more culturally significant

22:31.041 --> 22:32.583
or important than a great play.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.917
Miller:
It was just after the war,

22:34.917 --> 22:37.458
a boom was just starting,

22:37.458 --> 22:43.417
and here I'm writing about
this great war effort

22:43.417 --> 22:44.917
that we had just come through

22:44.917 --> 22:47.375
where everybody was celebrating
everything.

22:47.375 --> 22:50.458
And what the play is doing
is saying, "Listen,

22:50.458 --> 22:52.625
there was a lot of crookedness
in this war,

22:52.625 --> 22:55.125
there's a lot of selfish people
who didn't give a damn

22:55.125 --> 22:56.834
about whether we won or lost."

22:56.834 --> 23:00.250
Is that as far
as your mind can see,
the business?

23:00.250 --> 23:03.250
What is that, the world,
the business?

23:03.250 --> 23:05.417
Don't you have a country?

23:05.417 --> 23:08.041
Don't you live in the world?

23:08.041 --> 23:11.083
Miller: Mary's mother
had unknowingly triggered
"All My Sons"

23:11.083 --> 23:13.250
when she gossiped
about a young girl

23:13.250 --> 23:15.208
somewhere in central Ohio

23:15.208 --> 23:17.750
who had turned her father in
to the FBI

23:17.750 --> 23:19.709
for having manufactured

23:19.709 --> 23:21.417
faulty aircraft parts

23:21.417 --> 23:23.000
during the war.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.625
Chris Keller: It means
you knew  they'd crash!

23:25.625 --> 23:27.917
- It don't mean that!
- Then you thought
they'd crash!

23:27.917 --> 23:29.291
I was afraid maybe--

23:29.291 --> 23:32.208
You were afraid maybe?

23:32.208 --> 23:35.625
Miller: This kind of placid
American backyard

23:35.625 --> 23:37.959
was not ordinarily associated,

23:37.959 --> 23:40.500
at least in 1947,

23:40.500 --> 23:44.291
with murder and suicide.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.208
Well, it was the son

23:46.208 --> 23:50.125
who was discovering the--
the, uh,

23:50.125 --> 23:52.792
the, uh, failing
of a father,

23:52.792 --> 23:56.458
and leveling a judgment upon him

23:56.458 --> 23:58.500
which is very harsh.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.500
I know you're no worse
than most men,

24:01.500 --> 24:03.458
but I thought you were better.

24:04.875 --> 24:07.834
I never saw you as a man.

24:07.834 --> 24:10.709
I saw you as my father.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.625
Miller:
One tall and dignified man

24:16.625 --> 24:19.583
I saw standing
in the lobby crowd
at the intermission,

24:19.583 --> 24:22.792
his eyes red with weeping.

24:22.792 --> 24:27.000
To his companion,
who had asked what
he'd thought of the play,

24:27.000 --> 24:30.458
he muttered through thin,
barely moving lips,

24:30.458 --> 24:32.250
"I like it."

24:34.333 --> 24:37.709
Once I got the first inkling
that others were reached

24:37.709 --> 24:39.417
by what I wrote,

24:39.417 --> 24:40.792
an assumption arose

24:40.792 --> 24:42.834
that some kind
of public business

24:42.834 --> 24:46.333
was happening inside me.

24:46.333 --> 24:49.500
Your big job is not to make
simple things complicated,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.041
but to make complicated things
comprehensible.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.208
In other words, I'm the guy
that goes around and says,

24:54.208 --> 24:56.583
"Well, what is
really goin' on here?"

24:56.583 --> 25:00.709
Miller:
"All My Sons" had already
shown its impact,

25:00.709 --> 25:02.959
but the director, Elia Kazan,

25:02.959 --> 25:05.667
continued rehearsing
sections of it every day,

25:05.667 --> 25:09.041
driving it to ever more
intensified climaxes,

25:09.041 --> 25:11.000
working it like
a piece of music

25:11.000 --> 25:13.417
that had to be sustained here

25:13.417 --> 25:16.000
and hushed there.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.625
We were very close.
He was a wonderful director.

25:18.625 --> 25:22.375
I think he was the best
realistic director
we've ever had.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.333
Joan Miller:
He adored Kazan.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.083
Kazan was a little older,
as well,

25:27.083 --> 25:28.917
so I think he really
looked up to Kazan.

25:28.917 --> 25:31.000
They were like brothers.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.834
And I don't think
Dad ever had a friend
like that again--

25:35.834 --> 25:37.834
quite like that.

25:37.834 --> 25:42.333
We had the same attitude
toward the theater,

25:42.333 --> 25:44.959
which was that it was
a means to expression

25:44.959 --> 25:47.959
of a worldview
of one kind or another.

25:47.959 --> 25:51.875
Miller:
With "A Streetcar
Named Desire,"

25:51.875 --> 25:54.083
Tennessee Williams
had printed a license

25:54.083 --> 25:55.959
to speak at full throat,

25:55.959 --> 26:00.417
and it helped strengthen me
as I turned to Willy Loman.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.667
Rebecca:
When you start a play,

26:05.667 --> 26:07.667
do you start with a character?

26:10.792 --> 26:13.166
A person, a human being....

26:13.166 --> 26:14.834
- is what I start with.
- Not a story.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.500
- What?
- Not a story.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.959
Not a theme,
but one person.

26:18.959 --> 26:21.625
It's a mixture.
It's a mix-up.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.250
It's usually a character,

26:28.250 --> 26:33.333
because I can't think
in abstract terms too much.

26:33.333 --> 26:36.542
I like to get people
on the stage.

26:36.542 --> 26:41.166
Rebecca:
So, who was Willy based on?
Willy Loman.

26:41.166 --> 26:45.709
Miller: He was based originally
on an uncle of mine.

26:45.709 --> 26:48.250
He was a salesman,
he was completely crazy,

26:48.250 --> 26:53.250
and he would sweep you away
with these imaginary situations.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.917
He used to sit
in his garage,

26:55.917 --> 27:01.166
and hanging up
right over his head
was this spade.

27:01.166 --> 27:06.917
And I said,
"Could I borrow the spade
for an hour or two?"

27:06.917 --> 27:09.542
He'd look up and he'd say,
"I don't have a spade."

27:11.500 --> 27:13.291
And I couldn't dare say,

27:13.291 --> 27:15.500
"Well, there's one
right over your head."

27:15.500 --> 27:17.041
But it was more than that.

27:17.041 --> 27:20.583
He had a tragic aspect
to him, always, to me.

27:20.583 --> 27:22.583
In all his exaggerations,

27:22.583 --> 27:27.625
there was a striving underneath
to do something wonderful,

27:27.625 --> 27:29.917
something extraordinary.

27:29.917 --> 27:32.250
Like, a bit of an artist
in there.

27:36.458 --> 27:40.166
Miller: In reality,
all I had was
the first two lines:

27:40.166 --> 27:42.083
- Linda Loman: Willy?
- Miller: "Willy?"

27:42.083 --> 27:44.917
Willy Loman: It's all right.
I came back.

27:44.917 --> 27:47.250
Miller:
"It's all right. I came back."

27:47.250 --> 27:50.917
Further than that,
I dared not,
would not, venture

27:50.917 --> 27:53.667
until I could sit
in a completed studio--

27:53.667 --> 27:55.500
four walls, two windows,

27:55.500 --> 27:59.583
a floor and a roof
and a door.

27:59.583 --> 28:03.500
There's legends about
the hut he built to make it.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.458
Tell me a little bit
about that again.

28:05.458 --> 28:06.875
He built this special house--

28:06.875 --> 28:08.792
Rebecca: Yes,
he had it in his head,

28:08.792 --> 28:11.875
and he was already
composing the first act
as he built the house.

28:11.875 --> 28:15.750
Miller:
When I closed in the roof,
it was a miracle,

28:15.750 --> 28:19.208
as though I had mastered
the rain and cooled the sun.

28:19.208 --> 28:21.750
And all the while afraid
I would never be able

28:21.750 --> 28:25.458
to penetrate
past those first two lines.

28:25.458 --> 28:26.750
Rebecca:
Once he had it built,

28:26.750 --> 28:28.792
he sat down
and he wrote it.

28:28.792 --> 28:31.166
- And he wrote the first act
in one night.
- Yes.

28:31.166 --> 28:33.417
Miller: I started writing
one morning...

28:33.417 --> 28:35.291
Willy Loman: "Someday
I'm gonna have my own business

28:35.291 --> 28:37.291
and I'll never have
to leave home anymore."

28:37.291 --> 28:39.583
Miller: ...and wrote until
some hour in the darkness

28:39.583 --> 28:41.709
between midnight and 4:00.

28:41.709 --> 28:43.250
Willy Loman:
In the business world,

28:43.250 --> 28:45.625
the man who creates
a personal interest

28:45.625 --> 28:46.917
is the man who gets ahead."

28:46.917 --> 28:48.500
Miller:
When I lay down to sleep,

28:48.500 --> 28:50.917
I realized I had been weeping.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.458
My eyes still burned,

28:52.458 --> 28:55.458
and my throat was sore
from talking it all out,

28:55.458 --> 28:58.667
and shouting, and laughing.

28:58.667 --> 29:02.083
By the next morning,
I had done the first half.

29:02.083 --> 29:06.000
It would take
some six more weeks
to complete Act Two.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.375
I did not move far
from the phone

29:15.375 --> 29:19.583
for two days after sending
the script to Elia Kazan.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.166
By the end
of the second silent day,

29:22.166 --> 29:24.625
I would have accepted
his calling to tell me

29:24.625 --> 29:28.500
that it was an impenetrable,
unstageable piece of wreckage.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.083
And his tone,
when he finally did call,

29:31.083 --> 29:33.792
was alarmingly somber.

29:33.792 --> 29:35.709
"I've read your play."

29:35.709 --> 29:40.375
He sounded at a loss as to
how to give me the bad news.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.125
"My God, it's so sad.

29:45.458 --> 29:47.667
It's a great play, Artie.

29:47.667 --> 29:50.000
I want to do it in the fall
or winter."

29:53.667 --> 29:55.667
Linda Loman:
I don't say he's a great man.

29:55.667 --> 29:58.125
Willy Loman never
made a lot of money.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.875
His name was never
in the papers.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.667
He's not the finest character
that ever was.

30:02.667 --> 30:04.375
But he's a human being,

30:04.375 --> 30:06.709
and a terrible thing
is happening.

30:06.709 --> 30:09.750
So attention must be paid--
not to be allowed

30:09.750 --> 30:12.709
to fall into his grave
like an old dog.

30:12.709 --> 30:17.000
Attention! Attention
must finally be paid
to such a person!

30:17.000 --> 30:21.208
Nichols:
I remember seeing "Salesman,"
'cause I had a girlfriend

30:21.208 --> 30:23.417
whose mother would give us
theater tickets.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.041
And we didn't
go to the bathroom,

30:25.041 --> 30:28.375
we didn't do anything--
we just sat, stunned.

30:28.375 --> 30:31.917
Because it seemed
that was another world.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.291
That was not like
going to see a play--
it was something else.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.917
Kushner:
More than anything else,

30:37.917 --> 30:41.291
Willy has sacrificed
his entire life to getting

30:41.291 --> 30:43.834
a future for his son,

30:43.834 --> 30:47.041
who becomes,
as his mother says, a bum,

30:47.041 --> 30:49.917
you know, adrift and lost.

30:49.917 --> 30:52.750
In Willy's case,
he knows, on some level,

30:52.750 --> 30:55.959
that the infidelity
and the lies

30:55.959 --> 30:59.000
destroyed Biff's faith
in Willy,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.333
and it sort of
revealed the world

31:01.333 --> 31:04.500
as this kind of rotten,
rigged game.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.667
Rebecca: And it's a very
expressionist play,

31:06.667 --> 31:08.834
which is forgotten,
because it's a play--

31:08.834 --> 31:11.750
it's almost thought of
as such a realistic play.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.083
It isn't.

31:13.083 --> 31:16.250
It's quite the opposite.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.542
Miller:
I had known all along

31:18.542 --> 31:20.625
that this play could not
be accomplished

31:20.625 --> 31:22.542
by conventional realism,

31:22.542 --> 31:25.291
and for one integral reason--

31:25.291 --> 31:27.959
in Willy, the past was as alive

31:27.959 --> 31:30.125
as what was happening
at the moment,

31:30.125 --> 31:32.458
sometimes even crashing in

31:32.458 --> 31:35.458
to completely
overwhelm his mind.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.959
Rebecca: Do you remember
what your original title
for that was, you said?

31:38.959 --> 31:42.291
The title I thought
of originally

31:42.291 --> 31:45.250
was "The Inside of His Head."

31:45.250 --> 31:47.625
Kushner:
Something's going on
in Willy's head

31:47.625 --> 31:50.000
that's adrift in memory,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.083
and in  damaged  memory,

31:52.083 --> 31:55.500
because he's not
really sure where he is
at any moment.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.291
What is illusionistic
becomes real

31:58.291 --> 32:00.875
and what is real
becomes illusionistic.

32:00.875 --> 32:03.333
Willy Loman:
I have such thoughts.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.625
I have such strange thoughts.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.875
Linda Loman:
Willy, dear,
talk to them again.

32:07.875 --> 32:09.667
Kushner: Part of what
that structure is,

32:09.667 --> 32:14.000
which Kazan really helped
Arthur plunge into fully,

32:14.000 --> 32:17.667
and then Mielziner's set is--
it's a film structure,

32:17.667 --> 32:20.542
things bleed
from one thing into another,

32:20.542 --> 32:22.500
it's like dissolves.

32:22.500 --> 32:26.834
But that sort of dreamlike
damaged memory structure
of the play

32:26.834 --> 32:28.166
is fighting with

32:28.166 --> 32:29.959
the storytelling abilities

32:29.959 --> 32:31.667
and the dramatic
structural abilities

32:31.667 --> 32:35.166
of the greatest
narrative-realist dramatist

32:35.166 --> 32:38.500
since Henrik Ibsen.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.750
Miller:
So I thought I could do two
things at the same time.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.709
Two things
at the same time, meaning...?

32:43.709 --> 32:47.709
A psychological reality
and a social reality
at the same time,

32:47.709 --> 32:51.041
and a tragic scheme.

32:51.041 --> 32:54.375
Willy Loman:
The door of your life
is wide open!

32:54.375 --> 32:57.625
Biff Loman:
Pop! I'm a dime a dozen,
and so are you!

32:57.625 --> 32:59.250
I'm not a dime a dozen!

32:59.250 --> 33:00.917
I'm Willy Loman.
You're Biff Loman!

33:00.917 --> 33:04.041
I'm a dollar an hour!
I tried seven states...

33:04.041 --> 33:07.709
Miller:
The way I saw tragedy--
I guess I still do--

33:07.709 --> 33:11.834
is, there's a forward motion
on the part of a character.

33:11.834 --> 33:17.250
He is in search
of a value

33:17.250 --> 33:20.458
- which he is committed to...
- Rebecca: Yes.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.333
...to the point of his life.

33:23.333 --> 33:27.375
You said that you thought
tragedy was more optimistic
than comedy.

33:27.375 --> 33:33.417
It means an ultimate
confrontation with reality...

33:33.417 --> 33:35.792
when it's really done right.

33:35.792 --> 33:39.041
And that means

33:39.041 --> 33:42.625
that the individual
in the audience

33:42.625 --> 33:48.250
gets a firmer grip
on what's really going on
in their society

33:48.250 --> 33:50.333
at any one time.

33:50.333 --> 33:55.083
And that should
strengthen them

33:55.083 --> 33:57.583
to confront their lives.

33:57.583 --> 34:01.250
Miller:
There was no applause
at the final curtain

34:01.250 --> 34:03.333
of the first performance.

34:03.333 --> 34:07.000
Strange things began to go on
in the audience.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.542
With the curtain down,

34:08.542 --> 34:10.708
some people stood
to put their coats on

34:10.708 --> 34:12.625
and then sat again.

34:12.625 --> 34:14.208
Some, especially men,

34:14.208 --> 34:16.958
were bent forward,
covering their faces,

34:16.958 --> 34:19.750
and others were openly weeping.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.417
People crossed the theater

34:21.417 --> 34:24.417
to stand quietly
talking with one another.

34:24.417 --> 34:28.250
It seemed forever before
someone remembered to applaud,

34:28.250 --> 34:30.875
and then there was
no end to it.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.958
Nichols:
There were stories

34:39.958 --> 34:43.958
about fathers for whom
they had to call a doctor

34:43.958 --> 34:46.542
in the night after
they saw "Salesman,"

34:46.542 --> 34:49.667
because they cried all night.

34:49.667 --> 34:52.166
I heard that several times.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.875
Rebecca:
Why, do you think?

34:53.875 --> 34:55.958
I think they felt nailed.

34:55.958 --> 35:01.709
I thought-- I think they felt,
"Oh, my God, that's me."

35:01.709 --> 35:05.166
I'm not sure
I understand it altogether,

35:05.166 --> 35:09.500
because the effect
of that play is...

35:09.500 --> 35:13.709
is sometimes beyond
my comprehension,
quite frankly.

35:13.709 --> 35:17.083
All I can do
is express a vision

35:17.083 --> 35:20.625
of what--
of how to touch people,

35:20.625 --> 35:23.000
of how to move them,
of how to reach them.

35:25.625 --> 35:28.041
Nichols:
Did he or did he not feel

35:28.041 --> 35:31.208
that he burned something out
when he wrote it?

35:31.208 --> 35:33.542
I think, whoever wrote
"Salesman,"

35:33.542 --> 35:35.667
something would
have burned out,

35:35.667 --> 35:38.500
because it's so close
to the target,

35:38.500 --> 35:42.375
it's so....alive.

35:47.291 --> 35:49.291
Miller:
Well, with a success like that,

35:49.291 --> 35:53.125
you get feelings
of omnipotence.

35:53.125 --> 35:56.959
A little touch of it, you know?
You think you can do anything.

35:56.959 --> 35:59.208
You inevitably begin to feel

35:59.208 --> 36:03.208
a kind of impact of power

36:03.208 --> 36:07.041
which is sexual,
it is financial,

36:07.041 --> 36:08.709
it is everything.

36:08.709 --> 36:11.583
You begin to shift and change
if you're not careful,

36:11.583 --> 36:13.125
which I wasn't.

36:13.125 --> 36:14.792
People now were talking to me
differently--

36:14.792 --> 36:17.166
women, men--

36:17.166 --> 36:20.542
they were looking at me
like an icon of some kind.

36:22.792 --> 36:26.709
Well, then I felt with my--
with my wife then

36:26.709 --> 36:29.041
that we were...

36:29.041 --> 36:32.041
It wasn't enough for me,
suddenly.

36:32.041 --> 36:37.166
I thought I-- I had a feeling
that we were not close,

36:37.166 --> 36:38.917
that we were not one.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.625
Miller:
She was witty.

37:20.625 --> 37:23.792
She was making fun
of the situation

37:23.792 --> 37:26.667
as she was playing it.

37:26.667 --> 37:28.750
But that was the difference,
see,

37:28.750 --> 37:33.041
people thought they could
imitate her by being cute,

37:33.041 --> 37:37.333
but she was being cute
and making fun of being cute

37:37.333 --> 37:39.458
at the same time.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.041
So there was that...

37:43.917 --> 37:46.500
- Rebecca: They think--
- ...other dimension,

37:46.500 --> 37:48.250
which is very difficult to do.

37:49.750 --> 37:51.917
Mike Wallace:
I gather that you resisted

37:51.917 --> 37:53.542
getting involved
with Marilyn.

37:53.542 --> 37:55.583
Miller: For about four
or five years, sure.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.500
- Wallace: Why?
- Well, I was married,

37:57.500 --> 37:59.417
and I didn't want
to break up my marriage.

37:59.417 --> 38:00.542
Certainly not.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.333
Miller:
Since I was married

38:04.333 --> 38:06.709
and Marilyn could hardly
peek out of her hotel room door

38:06.709 --> 38:08.333
without being photographed,

38:08.333 --> 38:11.166
we spent much time
alone together.

38:11.166 --> 38:15.542
A bond of shared silences
as mysterious as sexuality,

38:15.542 --> 38:19.625
and as hard to break,
also began to form.

38:19.625 --> 38:23.250
After one of those silences
I said,

38:23.250 --> 38:25.792
"You're the saddest girl
I've ever met."

38:25.792 --> 38:28.250
A smile touched her lips

38:28.250 --> 38:31.166
as she discovered
the compliment I had intended.

38:33.834 --> 38:36.917
"You're the only one
who ever said that to me."

38:43.208 --> 38:46.834
I certainly do believe
that the Communist Party
should be outlawed.

38:46.834 --> 38:50.375
If I had my way about it,
they'd all be sent
back to Russia.

38:50.375 --> 38:54.208
Rebecca: Dad had been
radicalized by Marxism

38:54.208 --> 38:56.417
when he was in his teens,

38:56.417 --> 39:01.291
but soon came to feel
that there wasn't enough room

39:01.291 --> 39:03.333
for the individual in Marxism

39:03.333 --> 39:06.750
and became a liberal

39:06.750 --> 39:10.667
and really dedicated much
of his life to liberal causes.

39:10.667 --> 39:14.291
But in the 1950s,
it was dangerous

39:14.291 --> 39:18.125
to be a liberal
and an artist.

39:18.125 --> 39:20.583
Miller:
A kind of popular fascism

39:20.583 --> 39:22.917
was developing
in the United States.

39:22.917 --> 39:24.542
Seriously.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.583
As we know now,

39:26.583 --> 39:28.542
the situation with the FBI
and the rest of it

39:28.542 --> 39:32.458
was far worse than anybody
even imagined in those times.

39:32.458 --> 39:33.917
There were...

39:33.917 --> 39:35.959
there were spies everywhere.

39:35.959 --> 39:38.500
I found out
only 25 years later,

39:38.500 --> 39:41.291
when I got my records
from the FBI,

39:41.291 --> 39:44.875
that they had followed people
from my house

39:44.875 --> 39:46.834
in Brooklyn.

39:46.834 --> 39:50.041
They had tailed people
at a dinner party.

39:50.041 --> 39:54.125
See, the big switch
was the turnaround

39:54.125 --> 39:55.750
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union,

39:55.750 --> 39:58.375
which had been our ally
and suddenly was the enemy.

39:58.375 --> 40:02.625
And that left a whole sector
of the American population

40:02.625 --> 40:06.333
high and dry, because these
people had been pro-Soviet

40:06.333 --> 40:10.375
or they were at least pro-labor
and pro-all that--

40:10.375 --> 40:12.291
- liberal.
- Rebecca: Right.

40:12.291 --> 40:15.792
And suddenly these people
were regarded as traitors,
treasonous.

40:15.792 --> 40:19.208
Man: The Committee
on Un-American Activities

40:19.208 --> 40:22.041
is investigating
communist infiltration

40:22.041 --> 40:24.000
in the motion picture industry.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.750
Man 2: Victory will be assured
once communists

40:26.750 --> 40:28.709
are identified and exposed.

40:30.333 --> 40:33.583
Miller: Actors, directors--
everybody.

40:33.583 --> 40:36.375
Their careers were destroyed
overnight

40:36.375 --> 40:39.625
because they wouldn't cooperate
with some, you know,

40:39.625 --> 40:42.625
Indiana Republican
who was hounding them.

40:42.625 --> 40:44.750
Man: Are you a member
of the Communist Party,

40:44.750 --> 40:47.792
or have you ever been a member
of the Communist Party?

40:47.792 --> 40:49.583
Lawson: It's unfortunate
and tragic

40:49.583 --> 40:51.333
that I have to teach
this committee

40:51.333 --> 40:53.166
the basic principles
of Americanism.

40:53.166 --> 40:54.917
Man: That's not
the question!

40:54.917 --> 40:57.834
Man: John Howard Lawson
refused to answer the question

40:57.834 --> 41:00.375
"Are you a member
of the Communist Party?"

41:00.375 --> 41:03.875
Therefore it is the unanimous
opinion of this subcommittee

41:04.917 --> 41:06.667
that John Howard Lawson

41:06.667 --> 41:08.375
is in contempt of Congress.

41:13.333 --> 41:17.000
And you got the feeling
once again

41:17.000 --> 41:20.959
that there was no value
anywhere.

41:20.959 --> 41:23.750
You know, we were all...

41:23.750 --> 41:26.959
the subject of Big Power.

41:26.959 --> 41:30.583
Miller: A living connection
between Washington

41:30.583 --> 41:33.208
and the Salem witchcraft
phenomenon

41:33.208 --> 41:34.917
was made in my mind.

41:34.917 --> 41:36.291
The main point of the hearings,

41:36.291 --> 41:39.542
precisely as in
17th century Salem,

41:39.542 --> 41:42.208
was that the accused
make public confession.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.083
Man:
Have you ever been a member of
the Communist Party?

41:45.083 --> 41:47.583
- Yes or no?
- I don't believe
you have the right

41:47.583 --> 41:49.375
to ask that question
of anybody.

41:49.375 --> 41:53.083
I felt that it would soon be
too late to do anything--

41:53.083 --> 41:55.583
that you would never
get a play on

41:55.583 --> 41:57.583
or be able to say anything.

41:57.583 --> 42:00.083
I was really quite desperate.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.208
So while the theater
was still running,

42:02.208 --> 42:04.250
I thought it was time
to say something.

42:04.250 --> 42:08.959
Miller:
I was on my way up to Salem

42:08.959 --> 42:13.125
'cause I wanted to do some
research for "The Crucible."

42:13.125 --> 42:15.208
The day before I was to leave,

42:15.208 --> 42:18.083
Kazan phoned
and asked to see me.

42:18.083 --> 42:21.458
I stopped off
on the way north.

42:21.458 --> 42:25.959
And that's when he told me
that he was going to tell

42:25.959 --> 42:28.709
about other people he knew
in the party.

42:28.709 --> 42:32.166
They made it clear to him

42:32.166 --> 42:34.041
that if he didn't do that,

42:34.041 --> 42:37.500
he could never work
in films again.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.625
Rebecca:
So when you saw him,
how did you--

42:39.625 --> 42:42.500
he said, "I'm doing this,"
and did you try
to dissuade him?

42:42.500 --> 42:46.291
Well, I told him I thought
it was a terrible mistake,

42:46.291 --> 42:50.458
that this thing
would not last--

42:50.458 --> 42:53.500
the Un-American Committee
fever--

42:53.500 --> 42:55.709
that if it did,
it wouldn't matter,

42:55.709 --> 42:57.709
because we'd have fascism
in this country.

42:57.709 --> 42:59.875
Meantime, he could
work in the theater,

42:59.875 --> 43:01.667
there was no blacklist
in the theater.

43:01.667 --> 43:04.000
And he said, well,
he wanted to make films.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.500
So he thought
he had to do this.

43:09.500 --> 43:13.291
The real villain here
was not him

43:13.291 --> 43:15.250
or people like him.

43:15.250 --> 43:18.250
It was the House Committee
on Un-American Activities

43:18.250 --> 43:19.875
and Joe McCarthy.

43:19.875 --> 43:22.166
Everybody lost sight of them.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.166
They'd vanish
into the woodwork.

43:24.166 --> 43:27.875
And they keep blaming these
people who were essentially...

43:27.875 --> 43:29.834
...victims.

43:33.083 --> 43:35.959
Miller: I left Salem
in the late afternoon,

43:35.959 --> 43:38.667
and the 6:00 news
came on the radio

43:38.667 --> 43:40.250
with the black night

43:40.250 --> 43:42.542
like a cloak thrown over
the windshield.

43:42.542 --> 43:44.792
Man on radio: Good evening.
Today in Washington...

43:44.792 --> 43:48.792
Miller:
The announcer read a bulletin
about Elia Kazan's testimony

43:48.792 --> 43:51.750
before the House Un-American
Activities Committee

43:51.750 --> 43:53.875
and mentioned the people
he had named.

43:53.875 --> 43:56.959
Man on radio: Clifford Odets,
J. Edward Bromberg...

43:56.959 --> 43:58.750
Miller:
A numbness held me.

43:58.750 --> 44:00.333
Man on radio:
...Phoebe Brandt,

44:00.333 --> 44:02.375
James Proctor, Lewis Leverett,

44:02.375 --> 44:04.291
Morris Carnovsky...

44:04.291 --> 44:06.208
Miller:
It was sadness--

44:06.208 --> 44:08.917
purely mournful; deadening.

44:10.250 --> 44:11.875
As I headed downtown

44:11.875 --> 44:13.875
toward the Brooklyn Bridge,

44:13.875 --> 44:17.542
I found myself
keeping to the slow side
of the speedometer

44:17.542 --> 44:20.667
as though to protect
what truth there was in me

44:20.667 --> 44:22.709
from skidding into oblivion.

44:22.709 --> 44:25.834
That I was committed
to this play

44:25.834 --> 44:27.959
was no longer a question
for me--

44:27.959 --> 44:31.083
I had made the decision,
without thinking about it,

44:31.083 --> 44:34.208
somewhere between Salem
and this city.

44:37.417 --> 44:41.500
Kushner:
It's about a dilemma
that every society

44:41.500 --> 44:44.458
comes to
at one point or another,

44:44.458 --> 44:48.917
which is when the powerful
make an alliance with the mad.

44:51.041 --> 44:54.041
Reverend Parris:
You are all aware of the rumors

44:54.041 --> 44:58.750
of that spirit come among us
out of Hell...

44:58.750 --> 45:01.083
Miller:
The fascinating thing to me,

45:01.083 --> 45:03.834
that a town of this kind
could suddenly erupt

45:03.834 --> 45:06.500
in that kind
of an explosive hysteria.

45:06.500 --> 45:11.750
The whole attitude
of the '50s
started to develop,

45:11.750 --> 45:14.041
where, on a different level,

45:14.041 --> 45:16.250
with different folkways
and so on,

45:16.250 --> 45:19.208
essentially,
the same phenomenon
was occurring.

45:19.208 --> 45:20.750
Mr. Hawthorne!

45:20.750 --> 45:24.625
I am innocent to a witch!
I know not what a witch is.

45:24.625 --> 45:27.125
If you know not
what a witch is,

45:27.125 --> 45:29.208
how do you know
you are not  one?!

45:29.208 --> 45:32.709
Miller:
The guilt of the victim
was very interesting to me.

45:32.709 --> 45:35.625
You may not feel guilty for
what they've charged you with,

45:35.625 --> 45:38.000
but that doesn't matter.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.417
You're charged,
so you feel guilty
about something else.

45:44.792 --> 45:48.625
Miller:
The central image was that
of a guilt-ridden man,

45:48.625 --> 45:50.166
John Proctor,

45:50.166 --> 45:53.208
who, having slept with
his teenage servant girl,

45:53.208 --> 45:56.250
watches with horror
as she becomes the leader

45:56.250 --> 45:57.625
of the witch-hunting pack

45:57.625 --> 45:59.750
and points her accusing finger

45:59.750 --> 46:02.834
at the wife
he has himself betrayed.

46:02.834 --> 46:05.333
The noose is up.

46:08.667 --> 46:10.458
There'll be no noose.

46:15.208 --> 46:19.125
Abigail wants me dead, John.
You know it.

46:19.125 --> 46:23.041
Miller:
It reflected what I was
going through in my marriage.

46:23.041 --> 46:25.291
- Rebecca:
Guilt on your part?
- On my part.

46:25.291 --> 46:27.125
And anger on whose part?

46:27.125 --> 46:28.625
My own part.

46:28.625 --> 46:30.166
Also on your part.

46:30.166 --> 46:32.834
Uh...

46:32.834 --> 46:35.542
and my wife--
my then-wife's part.

46:35.542 --> 46:38.375
Let you look
for some goodness in me...

46:41.208 --> 46:43.083
and judge me not.

46:46.417 --> 46:50.875
The magistrate
sits in your heart
that judges you.

46:50.875 --> 46:53.583
I never thought you
but a good man, John,

46:53.583 --> 46:55.208
only somewhat bewildered.

46:57.917 --> 47:00.542
Oh, Elizabeth...

47:00.542 --> 47:03.041
your justice
would freeze beer.

47:04.583 --> 47:06.000
Rebecca:
And yet in the play,

47:06.000 --> 47:07.875
there's such
a beautiful reconciliation

47:07.875 --> 47:09.542
between the wife
and the husband,

47:09.542 --> 47:11.875
which in real life,
there wasn't.

47:11.875 --> 47:14.417
No, there wasn't.
But I didn't get hung.

47:14.417 --> 47:18.250
That's the best way
to reconcile people.

47:18.250 --> 47:21.166
You hang one of 'em,

47:21.166 --> 47:23.375
or, if necessary, both.

47:26.083 --> 47:28.417
Bob Miller:
Jane went up to his studio

47:28.417 --> 47:31.000
on the top floor
of the Willow Street house,

47:31.000 --> 47:32.792
I guess she came down,

47:32.792 --> 47:34.041
and then she and Mom

47:34.041 --> 47:35.542
were sort of
in Jane's bedroom,

47:35.542 --> 47:37.250
which was right
at the bottom of the stairs,

47:37.250 --> 47:39.250
and they were crying.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.875
Then I was gonna go out
and say, "Well, I'm not--

47:41.875 --> 47:44.625
I'm actually gonna
go away for a little while."

47:44.625 --> 47:47.417
And I just remember
being sort of mystified
by the whole thing,

47:47.417 --> 47:49.250
him and Mom
sort of hug and kiss goodbye,

47:49.250 --> 47:51.333
and Jane and I always tittered
when they hugged and kissed

47:51.333 --> 47:53.458
'cause we were little.

47:53.458 --> 47:57.375
So I remember that last time
that there was a hug and a kiss

47:57.375 --> 48:00.834
and started realizing that
that's probably the last time.

48:02.458 --> 48:05.083
Mike Wallace: And you have
a sense of guilt about it?

48:05.083 --> 48:06.333
Miller: Terrible.

48:06.333 --> 48:08.291
It rolls all over you.

48:08.291 --> 48:12.750
Miller:
During our rehearsals
of "A View From the Bridge,"

48:12.750 --> 48:14.583
on 42nd Street,

48:14.583 --> 48:17.959
I passed a life-sized cutout
of her in the lobby

48:17.959 --> 48:19.583
every day.

48:19.583 --> 48:22.291
The famous laughing shot
from "The Seven Year Itch,"

48:22.291 --> 48:24.000
in a white dress

48:24.000 --> 48:26.583
with her skirt blowing up
over a subway grate,

48:26.583 --> 48:29.000
whereupon I would sit
for six hours

48:29.000 --> 48:30.875
as Van Heflin/Eddie Carbone

48:30.875 --> 48:35.792
struggled with a compulsion
he could not nail or destroy.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.625
The best work
that anybody ever writes

48:41.625 --> 48:45.208
is a work that is on the verge
of embarrassing him.

48:45.208 --> 48:48.333
Always.
It's inevitable.

48:48.333 --> 48:50.625
Where he puts himself
on the line--

48:50.625 --> 48:52.625
sometimes quite secretly...

48:52.625 --> 48:54.333
sometimes symbolically.

48:54.333 --> 48:57.041
Kushner:
I remember when I read
"View From the Bridge"

48:57.041 --> 48:58.792
in college,

48:58.792 --> 49:03.750
the way that it deals
directly with sexuality
and desire,

49:03.750 --> 49:08.041
it seemed like a departure,
in a way,

49:08.041 --> 49:10.875
it's filled with moral dilemma,

49:10.875 --> 49:14.959
but it's also about
sort of insatiable desire

49:14.959 --> 49:17.000
and sort of implacable appetite.

49:54.667 --> 49:56.542
Miller:
I guess we're all,
every artist,

49:56.542 --> 50:01.208
there's a tendency to throw
himself into the world

50:01.208 --> 50:02.834
and see if he floats.

50:04.875 --> 50:08.041
Miller: When she appeared,
the future vanished.

50:08.041 --> 50:10.250
She seemed without
expectations,

50:10.250 --> 50:12.959
and this was like freedom.

50:12.959 --> 50:16.250
To my thoughts,
it was total honesty--

50:16.250 --> 50:19.083
that's what knocked me out.

50:19.083 --> 50:23.625
She seemed utterly
without guile...

50:23.625 --> 50:26.417
completely honest
about herself

50:26.417 --> 50:29.417
and about anything
she looked at.

50:29.417 --> 50:32.000
Whereas the society
I came from

50:32.000 --> 50:35.583
was very guarded,
judgmental--

50:35.583 --> 50:38.417
we made judgments of people.

50:38.417 --> 50:41.417
She accepted that everybody
was who they were

50:41.417 --> 50:43.041
and what they were.

50:43.041 --> 50:47.291
This appearance
of being absolutely free

50:47.291 --> 50:50.792
was simply a disguise.

50:50.792 --> 50:55.291
She was in a way
the most repressed person
imaginable--

50:55.291 --> 50:58.667
been kicked around as a child,
she'd been abused as a child,

50:58.667 --> 51:01.500
she'd been deserted,
abandoned.

51:01.500 --> 51:06.000
She was a very courageous
human being.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.458
It was because I loved her,

51:07.458 --> 51:10.250
so I took that attitude
toward her.

51:10.250 --> 51:12.709
So the best of her,
she thought,

51:12.709 --> 51:14.709
was in my eye;

51:14.709 --> 51:17.500
therefore the hope she had
was with me.

51:24.959 --> 51:27.041
Rebecca: What was your
first notice that you got

51:27.041 --> 51:29.125
that you were going
to get in trouble

51:29.125 --> 51:32.083
with the Un-American
Activities Committee?

51:32.083 --> 51:35.792
Well, they never bothered me
until I married Marilyn.

51:35.792 --> 51:39.583
And then they--
they were already
on a downslope.

51:39.583 --> 51:41.667
People were getting bored
with them,

51:41.667 --> 51:45.291
so they saw a terrific chance
for a lot of good publicity.

51:47.166 --> 51:49.500
Monroe:
I would like to say that

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
I'm truly confident

51:51.500 --> 51:55.166
that, in the end,
my husband will
win this case.

51:55.166 --> 51:57.875
We are a country
of entertainers.

51:57.875 --> 52:00.125
You gotta be entertaining.

52:00.125 --> 52:02.333
Even the fascists
have to be entertaining.

52:02.333 --> 52:05.291
Man:
...truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

52:05.291 --> 52:06.834
so help you God.

52:06.834 --> 52:09.041
Miller:
They were replaying
"The Crucible."

52:09.041 --> 52:10.458
Man: Are you a member
of the Communist Party?

52:10.458 --> 52:11.834
Miller:
I'd said that I had attended

52:11.834 --> 52:13.458
meetings of communist writers,

52:13.458 --> 52:16.000
and they said, "Well,
was so-and-so in the room?"

52:16.000 --> 52:18.583
And so-and-so and so-and-so
and so-and-so in the room.

52:18.583 --> 52:21.709
And I had to say, "I'm not
gonna talk about anybody else."

52:23.542 --> 52:26.625
Miller: I don't believe,
and I never did, that a man

52:26.625 --> 52:29.208
has to become an informer

52:29.208 --> 52:31.291
in order to practice
his profession freely

52:31.291 --> 52:32.625
in the United States.

52:32.625 --> 52:34.667
Now the important question,
Mr. Miller:

52:34.667 --> 52:36.208
Where's Marilyn?

52:36.208 --> 52:38.458
She's waiting for me
at home.

52:38.458 --> 52:40.333
Miller:
When I got to Washington,

52:40.333 --> 52:41.792
the head of the committee

52:41.792 --> 52:43.542
offered to call off
the whole hearing

52:43.542 --> 52:46.959
if Marilyn would take
a photograph with him.

52:46.959 --> 52:48.667
Rebecca:
Oh, my God.

52:48.667 --> 52:53.625
Miller: And I said they'd
better have the hearing.

52:53.625 --> 52:57.250
A few months later
we had to go through a trial
in federal court,

52:57.250 --> 52:59.583
and I was found guilty
of contempt.

52:59.583 --> 53:01.750
So I was fined $500

53:01.750 --> 53:04.250
and sentenced to a year in jail

53:04.250 --> 53:06.375
that was suspended.

53:06.375 --> 53:08.250
The whole thing was simply

53:08.250 --> 53:10.834
beyond description.

53:10.834 --> 53:12.875
Reporter:
How do you think
of this whole ruckus,

53:12.875 --> 53:15.417
Miss Monroe?
Miss Monroe.

53:15.417 --> 53:17.208
Bob:
It was dreadful.

53:17.208 --> 53:19.542
I mean, you couldn't go down
to buy a newspaper.

53:19.542 --> 53:21.834
We couldn't just walk down
and get an ice cream.

53:21.834 --> 53:25.291
We couldn't do that.
I mean, the simplest things.

53:25.291 --> 53:27.792
Miller:
If you're with somebody

53:27.792 --> 53:30.542
who's that celebrated
in the world,

53:30.542 --> 53:34.458
it distorts a lot of reality.

53:34.458 --> 53:38.792
And so that was
a difficulty to get over.

53:38.792 --> 53:42.041
And I never quite made it,
I admit.

53:42.041 --> 53:43.709
Reporter: Mr. Miller,
would you make

53:43.709 --> 53:46.125
some kind of comment
for us?

53:47.709 --> 53:50.083
Reporter 2:
Will you be writing
from here on in?

53:50.083 --> 53:51.583
Yes, exactly.

53:51.583 --> 53:53.792
What'll you be
working on, exactly?

53:53.792 --> 53:55.625
You produced very little
during your years with her.

53:55.625 --> 53:58.458
- That's right.
- Why?

53:58.458 --> 54:02.625
I guess, to be frank about it,
I was taking care of her.

54:02.625 --> 54:06.583
Monroe:
Do I feel happy in life?

54:06.583 --> 54:09.291
Um...

54:09.291 --> 54:10.959
if I'm generally anything,

54:10.959 --> 54:13.500
I guess
I'm generally miserable.

54:14.583 --> 54:16.125
Basically, it was terror

54:16.125 --> 54:19.375
that she was...
gonna be found out

54:19.375 --> 54:22.041
as a faker.

54:22.041 --> 54:25.417
That somebody
was gonna stand up

54:25.417 --> 54:27.667
and make some accusations
against her.

54:27.667 --> 54:31.000
Bob:
While she could be pleasant
and fun and bubbly

54:31.000 --> 54:32.959
and, you know, lovely,

54:32.959 --> 54:36.542
she could go places
that were just--
she was in pain.

54:36.542 --> 54:38.500
You could see it come over her,
kind of, in a way.

54:38.500 --> 54:42.333
Rebecca: And you were always
trying to buck her up?

54:42.333 --> 54:43.375
Miller: Yeah.

54:43.375 --> 54:44.834
Trying to get her to see

54:44.834 --> 54:46.875
the brighter side
of things.

54:46.875 --> 54:51.250
Which is just about
the most thankless job

54:51.250 --> 54:53.667
you can possibly imagine.

54:53.667 --> 54:59.875
Bob:
He's typically not doing things
just to please somebody else,

54:59.875 --> 55:01.917
but I think he really did

55:01.917 --> 55:04.000
as much as he was capable
of doing

55:04.000 --> 55:07.583
to try and get her
to chase those demons away.

55:07.583 --> 55:10.041
Rebecca:
Do you think Dad
was under her spell?

55:10.041 --> 55:11.542
I think so.

55:11.542 --> 55:13.667
Or under his own spell,
of, you know,

55:13.667 --> 55:16.208
of being the hero,
the savior,

55:16.208 --> 55:18.750
the one who could turn her.

55:18.750 --> 55:21.834
And "The Misfits," I think,
is a great example of that.

55:21.834 --> 55:25.166
Gay Langland: I think you're
the saddest girl I ever met.

55:25.166 --> 55:28.333
You're the first man
that ever said that.

55:28.333 --> 55:30.333
I'm usually told
how happy I am.

55:32.333 --> 55:34.208
Miller:
I just thought it would be

55:34.208 --> 55:36.458
a terrific gift for her.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.125
'Cause she'd never had a part

55:38.125 --> 55:42.083
in which she was supposed
to be taken seriously.

55:42.083 --> 55:44.709
And she wanted to do that.

55:44.709 --> 55:46.834
Miller:
I had written a story

55:46.834 --> 55:49.750
based originally on when
I was living in Nevada,

55:49.750 --> 55:51.083
getting a divorce.

55:51.083 --> 55:54.250
I fell in with three cowboys

55:54.250 --> 55:55.709
while I was there,

55:55.709 --> 55:57.458
and they were hunting mustang.

56:00.458 --> 56:02.792
They were warring on these
beasts.

56:02.792 --> 56:03.875
Rebecca: Yeah.

56:05.542 --> 56:08.333
When they won,
it felt good,

56:08.333 --> 56:12.709
and they felt confirmed
in their manhood.

56:12.709 --> 56:14.667
Murderers!

56:14.667 --> 56:17.834
You're only happy
when you can see
something die!

56:17.834 --> 56:20.625
Why don't kill yourselves
and be happy?!

56:20.625 --> 56:23.917
You and your
God's country!
Freedom!

56:23.917 --> 56:27.959
In my film,
Gable cuts them loose
at the end.

56:27.959 --> 56:29.875
What are you doin'?

56:29.875 --> 56:31.834
But that didn't
often happen.

56:37.166 --> 56:38.583
Of course...

56:38.583 --> 56:40.458
what "The Misfits" was after

56:40.458 --> 56:44.250
was that this is
an attempt by people

56:44.250 --> 56:49.291
to find some way
of being at home in the world.

56:49.291 --> 56:54.041
And the world is so hard
and so rejecting

56:54.041 --> 56:58.125
that they cannot find a niche
in which to call home.

57:03.166 --> 57:06.041
Miller:
The picture took an enormous
amount of time

57:06.041 --> 57:07.917
'cause she was sick
all of the time.

57:07.917 --> 57:10.208
Rebecca:
What was wrong with her?

57:10.208 --> 57:15.125
She couldn't really
gain for herself

57:15.125 --> 57:17.792
the confidence
that she had to have
to do this.

57:17.792 --> 57:20.709
She was extremely anxious

57:20.709 --> 57:23.625
that she wasn't
really good enough for it.

57:23.625 --> 57:26.875
Although that's not
the way she'd express it.

57:26.875 --> 57:31.000
She would blame people
for not treating her right.

57:34.667 --> 57:36.417
At the last minute

57:36.417 --> 57:40.166
she would find things
to find imperfect
about herself

57:40.166 --> 57:42.166
if she had to be somewhere.

57:43.709 --> 57:46.041
It was insecurity, of course,

57:46.041 --> 57:48.834
if you want to use the word.

57:48.834 --> 57:50.667
But, uh...

57:54.500 --> 57:56.917
...she could be late,

57:56.917 --> 57:59.709
missing the day's work.

57:59.709 --> 58:03.250
So everybody's hanging around
all day long.

58:03.250 --> 58:09.291
And the  esprit  of everybody
was nonexistent, finally.

58:09.291 --> 58:11.250
Several hundred people
involved,

58:11.250 --> 58:16.583
all leaning on
this fragile creature.

58:16.583 --> 58:19.208
It's a terrific pressure.

58:20.917 --> 58:22.291
Guy: Come on, honey.

58:22.291 --> 58:24.166
We're gonna have some drinks.

58:24.166 --> 58:28.291
Miller:
And the solution was
all kinds of pills and...

58:28.291 --> 58:30.750
alcohol...

58:30.750 --> 58:33.709
gigantic barbiturates.

58:33.709 --> 58:37.583
They finally had to stop
shooting for about ten days

58:37.583 --> 58:41.583
while she went back
to Los Angeles and...

58:41.583 --> 58:44.250
just recuperated.

58:44.250 --> 58:47.083
There's no explaining
a person like that.

58:57.625 --> 58:59.417
Terrible.

59:00.542 --> 59:02.000
Well...

59:02.000 --> 59:04.625
Because you have
the gift for life, Roslyn.

59:04.625 --> 59:08.458
The rest of us,
we're just lookin'
for a place to hide,

59:08.458 --> 59:10.166
and watch it all go by.

59:10.166 --> 59:11.125
Amen.

59:12.792 --> 59:15.083
Here's to your life, Roslyn.

59:15.083 --> 59:16.667
I hope it goes on forever.

59:20.250 --> 59:22.417
We finally got through the film,

59:22.417 --> 59:23.959
and it was a pretty good film.

59:23.959 --> 59:26.583
It wasn't what I had hoped.

59:26.583 --> 59:29.792
We were separated
during the shooting.

59:29.792 --> 59:31.959
And, uh...

59:31.959 --> 59:34.333
well, she went back
to California

59:34.333 --> 59:39.458
and they started shooting
another picture for Fox

59:39.458 --> 59:41.750
that she failed to complete.

59:43.458 --> 59:45.083
Rebecca: Yeah.

59:47.625 --> 59:50.333
And then you moved back here?
Did you move-- Did you--

59:50.333 --> 59:53.625
Well, I started
to live up here a lot.

59:56.458 --> 59:58.291
Miller:
As I was coming to the end

59:58.291 --> 01:00:00.667
of the writing
of "After the Fall,"

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:04.583
the horrifying news came
that Marilyn had died,

01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:08.458
apparently of an overdose
of sleeping pills.

01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:12.166
When a reporter called,

01:00:12.166 --> 01:00:15.166
asking if I would be attending
her funeral in California,

01:00:15.166 --> 01:00:19.125
stunned as I was,
I answered, without thinking,

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:21.625
"She won't be there."

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:28.500
Rebecca:
You were prone to walk away
from conflict, naturally.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.875
But in your plays,
there's a continual
kind of return of conflict.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:38.375
I suppose it's because,
there, I could live it out

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:41.709
in the literature,
in the writing,

01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:45.542
whereas in life,
it was too painful,
you see?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:48.041
So the pain
went into the writing,

01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:53.959
whereas it was hard
to sustain it in real life.

01:00:53.959 --> 01:00:56.500
I think that's part
of what happened.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500
Why do you think that is?

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:03.917
I don't know, I just
couldn't bear the idea of...

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:08.166
people trying to
destroy each other.

01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:10.125
Because I sensed
very early on

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:14.917
that all real arguments
are murderous.

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:20.583
There was a killing instinct
in there that I feared.

01:01:20.583 --> 01:01:24.041
So I put it into
the theater.

01:01:24.041 --> 01:01:27.917
Man: "After the Fall,"
Act One.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:31.333
The action takes place
in the mind, thought,

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:34.291
and memory of Quentin.

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:38.917
It was partly out of a book,
which is never mentioned,

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:41.000
and that was Camus' book

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.250
in which a man observes
a young woman

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:48.583
who throws herself
into a rushing river.

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:51.208
He doesn't go
to save her.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:55.291
My question was,
what if he had  saved her?

01:01:57.417 --> 01:01:59.125
Miller:
See, I think that

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:03.458
all suicides are murdered.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:07.291
Uh, they are the victims
of aggression...

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:10.125
or sometimes the victims
of truth.

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:12.125
Quentin:
Maggie, you want to die,

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.333
and I don't know
how to prevent it.

01:02:14.333 --> 01:02:16.000
Miller:
In "After the Fall,"

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.125
one of the partners
of this marriage

01:02:18.125 --> 01:02:21.291
cannot go forward
with the illusion
that the other one has.

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:24.709
It means she dies alone,
or they both go down.

01:02:24.709 --> 01:02:28.750
Or whoever can save himself,
saves himself.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.625
Rebecca:
In "After the Fall,"

01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:34.959
Quentin essentially
is trying himself

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:37.208
for being able--to--

01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:39.125
for the fact that
he could have killed Maggie.

01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:41.166
In that sense,
it reflects

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:43.834
- the relationship
with Marilyn?
- Yeah, sure.

01:02:43.834 --> 01:02:46.792
Maggie:
He's gonna put me away
somewhere, is that it?

01:02:46.792 --> 01:02:48.667
Quentin: No, the doctor
isn't considering--

01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:50.542
You're not gonna
put me anywhere,
mister.

01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:53.000
Maggie, you have got
to be supervised!

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.834
Rebecca: And reconciling
yourself with the fact

01:02:54.834 --> 01:02:57.291
that you didn't save her,
but that in a sense,

01:02:57.291 --> 01:03:00.333
- you can't save anybody,
on some level.
- That's right.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:05.166
You got people
who were far more
difficult to change

01:03:05.166 --> 01:03:10.166
than I had allowed myself
to believe.

01:03:12.667 --> 01:03:14.959
Maggie:
Tell me what happened.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.583
Quentin:
Maggie, we used
one another.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:18.709
No!

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:23.875
Miller:
It was a very good production.

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:26.250
It was very well done,

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:29.542
and very successful
with the audience.

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:31.542
It experienced a lot

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:36.208
of very strident,
ugly criticism...

01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:42.166
and some extraordinarily
vicious attacks.

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:48.917
And...I managed
to have an illusion

01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:51.917
that this wasn't really Marilyn.

01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:54.208
Which it wasn't, really.

01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:57.375
But it was close enough.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:00.000
Kushner:
What's sort of wonderful
about the play is,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.959
it's so profoundly broken,

01:04:02.959 --> 01:04:05.542
it's unsparing
and it's brave,

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:08.917
and I love the fact
that he couldn't make it cohere

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:12.500
because what
he's grappling with,

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.792
you know, he could never
completely, you know,

01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:19.250
he was--he was putting his
finger in the electric socket.

01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:24.625
"After the Fall" is, you know,
he's too angry at her,

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:27.917
he's too...devastated

01:04:27.917 --> 01:04:32.000
by what that suicide...

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.625
meant to him
as a repudiation of himself,

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.959
as a narcissistic injury.

01:04:36.959 --> 01:04:39.500
Um...I mean,

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.875
he was too frightened by her,

01:04:41.875 --> 01:04:44.750
and he can't quite, you know--

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.458
He does much better with Inge.

01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:51.542
Inge Miller:
Incredible.

01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.792
It was a good year,
you think?

01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:56.667
Well, I don't want
to think about it.

01:04:56.667 --> 01:04:59.291
- Why?
- Too good.

01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:01.917
I'm gonna cut up
this here chicken.

01:05:01.917 --> 01:05:05.500
Whoa, this is cutting...
a dream.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.458
It is cutting rightly?

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:10.250
Miller: We met--
I was in a swimming pool.

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:12.834
Inge: No, we first met when

01:05:12.834 --> 01:05:16.583
I came with Cartier-Bresson
to photograph "The Misfits."

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:18.458
The first time
I listened  to you,

01:05:18.458 --> 01:05:19.917
you were in the swimming pool.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.667
But we didn't--
I hardly saw her there.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.750
No. No. We were working,
both of us, very hard.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.834
She was busy photographing
everybody.

01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:30.792
But then we met again...
a year later?

01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:32.375
Or maybe-- I went off

01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:34.333
to Argentina.

01:05:34.333 --> 01:05:36.834
First I want to France
to photograph
"Aimez-vous Brahms?"

01:05:36.834 --> 01:05:38.875
Then I went to Argentina
to photograph

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:43.542
a crazy movie with Yul Brynner
called "Taras Bulba."

01:05:43.542 --> 01:05:45.917
And then I came back,
and then I met you again

01:05:45.917 --> 01:05:49.000
like, maybe half a year later,
in the Magnum office.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You were looking for pictures
I had taken,

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.792
which they were making
a book out of
about "The Misfits."

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:57.333
Right?

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:59.208
I don't remember that,
but I'm sure it happened.

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:02.375
Rebecca:
My mother suffered a lot
during the war

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.000
and after the war.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.291
She had to work in
a munitions factory in Berlin.

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:14.291
She was interrogated
by Nazi officials

01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:16.542
because she wouldn't join
the Hitler Youth,

01:06:16.542 --> 01:06:20.625
even though her father
was a member of the Nazi Party.

01:06:20.625 --> 01:06:23.500
Inge: I was in Berlin
in a factory.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.250
It was heavily bombed--

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:27.625
constantly.

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:31.208
Rebecca:
And when Berlin fell,
where did you go?

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.875
I walked from Berlin
to Salzburg,

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:36.583
because there was no transport.

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:39.667
Everybody was walking, fleeing,

01:06:39.667 --> 01:06:41.417
there were refugees,
dead horses,

01:06:41.417 --> 01:06:43.375
and all the people
from the east

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:46.041
with dead babies and--
horrible.

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:49.750
So you kind of lose your mind
a little bit.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:54.083
Rebecca:
As much as she was somewhat
of a damaged person by that,

01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:58.166
she was also such a hugely
positive dynamo of a woman.

01:06:58.166 --> 01:07:00.458
She was the first
female photographer

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:03.875
to be a full member
of Magnum Photos.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.166
And really built herself
a spectacular life,

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:30.667
filled with work
and love affairs

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:34.291
and a beautiful apartment
and wonderful clothes,

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:36.291
and she met Arthur,

01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:39.959
and he was a very wounded
person at that point.

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:11.000
Rebecca:
She believed in him
enormously.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.583
She believed in his talent,
and also in him as a person.

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:18.041
And I think that
he had come to a point

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:20.375
where he felt terrible
about himself.

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:25.291
And I think that
she rejuvenated him.

01:08:25.291 --> 01:08:28.166
Arthur was very--
he was a very lonely man,

01:08:28.166 --> 01:08:30.750
very lonesome,
because when I first came,

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:33.125
there was just
one or two friends,

01:08:33.125 --> 01:08:35.332
I mean, nobody--
nobody came.

01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:39.000
I mean, I bring in
all these folks and friends,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.207
I think in many ways,
because he doesn't know
how to reach out.

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:46.667
Rebecca:
Did you see a lot of the family
when you got married?

01:08:46.667 --> 01:08:49.709
Inge: Yes, I saw them a lot,
and they liked me
because I was doing something,

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.667
you know, being a photographer
was fun for them,

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.500
and they came with me,

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.542
so I always had
a very good relationship

01:08:57.542 --> 01:08:59.291
with both Bobby and Jane.

01:08:59.291 --> 01:09:03.500
Bob: That house
was really not
a real home,

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.457
- until she came around,
you know.
- Rebecca: Yeah.

01:09:06.457 --> 01:09:08.917
Inge sort of put flowers
on the table,

01:09:08.917 --> 01:09:11.375
and, you know,
curtain on the windows,

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.542
where it just--
it started to feel lived in.

01:09:14.542 --> 01:09:18.667
He seemed to be refreshed
and renewed

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:22.709
and kind of
reinvigorated by it.

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:27.207
Miller:
For three days we went out
and climbed the hillside,

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:30.709
planting the hundreds
of seedlings out of the pail.

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:33.542
My wife Inge, pregnant then,

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:36.750
carefully set roots
in the slits I was cutting

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:38.792
with a flat spade.

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:40.875
Rebecca:
Did you always think

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:43.417
that you were always going
to stay married to Arthur?

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:46.291
No. No, not because of Arthur,

01:09:46.291 --> 01:09:48.207
but, simply,
I didn't think anybody--

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:53.250
I don't know, everything was
kind of a temporary idea.

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:56.583
We were--
We were ready to try it.

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:58.875
Rebecca:
When I was born,

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:02.417
my father was the one
who knew more about babies.

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:06.083
My mother picked out
a baby carriage for me

01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:09.125
which was, in fact,
a doll's carriage.

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:11.125
My father had to inform her

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:13.333
that I needed something bigger.

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:17.458
I've been thinking
about fatherhood

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:22.000
and about what you think
makes a good father.

01:10:24.959 --> 01:10:27.125
Oh, well...

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:33.959
I think we create,
especially the children,

01:10:33.959 --> 01:10:36.750
create these definitions.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:41.000
'Cause they have to--
they're helpless.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.583
So they create the definition
of...

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:47.959
this-- this great force

01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:53.375
which can sweep them away
or comfort them.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:55.667
And it's got sometimes
very little to do

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:59.125
with what the great force
is feeling.

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:07.333
Uh, I enjoyed being a father.

01:11:07.333 --> 01:11:11.792
I enjoyed, also,
escaping being a father.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:18.000
Bob: You know,
much of that relationship,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.875
as it went on
through the years,

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.542
was really trying to catch him

01:11:21.542 --> 01:11:24.542
when he had some time to,
you know, spend time.

01:11:24.542 --> 01:11:26.083
Rebecca:
What was he doing?

01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:28.291
What he always did, you know--
he was writing.

01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:30.500
I mean, that's what he did.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.250
- Right.
- When he was in his studio,

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.166
we tippy-toed around the studio

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:36.083
and you could hear
the keys clacking

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.166
and you knew that
you couldn't go in there.

01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:41.458
Joan:
I think at times
he was only interested

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:43.291
in what interested  him.

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:45.709
There were times
when he might be interested
in something

01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:47.875
because he could use it.

01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:51.166
I was always in and out
of my skin,

01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:54.208
because...

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:59.041
I just couldn't be a father
24 hours a day...

01:11:59.041 --> 01:12:02.709
and still do
what I was thinking
I had to do.

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:05.041
I mean, my mind would go off

01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:08.041
in whatever direction
it was going,

01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:13.000
and then you say,
"Oh, my God, I forgot
to pick up my son,"

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.875
who's standing on a corner.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.000
Bob: I don't think he ever
really understood--

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.917
felt that he understood me
in a way that he felt
he could be of much help.

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:27.834
As we were getting
to a place where we maybe

01:12:27.834 --> 01:12:31.208
could have a constructive
father-son relationship,

01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:33.458
it was at the same time
when the generations

01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:35.542
were getting
further and further apart.

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:39.250
So I was obviously gonna go
where the energy was for me,

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:41.917
which was into
the counterculture,

01:12:41.917 --> 01:12:44.083
and he couldn't go there.

01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:48.000
And so in some ways
it sort of was manifested
in the relationship,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.458
he kind of was dismayed
by it all.

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:55.250
Rebecca:
When I was growing up,

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:56.917
he continued to write,

01:12:56.917 --> 01:13:01.250
but his life had become
much less public,

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.000
much more private.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.125
I think he might have been
sheltering himself

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.458
with his family.

01:13:12.041 --> 01:13:15.208
Rebecca:
Do you think
it was harder to be...

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:18.750
in terms of--
for daughters or sons,

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:21.792
do you think that
that would have affected us?

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:24.291
My own view is that
it's harder to be a son,

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:28.166
because there's a certain
competition going on there.

01:13:28.166 --> 01:13:32.959
It's inevitable. It's like if
you watch the animal kingdom,

01:13:32.959 --> 01:13:37.542
the most dangerous
person or animal

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:41.333
to the young male
is his father.

01:13:42.917 --> 01:13:44.875
Rebecca:
He would confide in me.

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:47.333
He would talk to me
about his worries

01:13:47.333 --> 01:13:50.250
about being able to write.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:53.166
I don't even know if I answered
a lot of the time.

01:13:53.166 --> 01:13:56.792
I think it was as if
I was part of him.

01:13:56.792 --> 01:14:00.792
But the father
that I knew for the most part

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:04.625
was a very funny, cuddly,
jokey--

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:08.291
We would laugh so much.

01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:12.125
- Where's the nails, Dad?
- Hand the nails out!

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:14.333
OK. Now--

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.875
You gotta nail it--

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.208
Woman:
No, you just stand still

01:14:17.208 --> 01:14:19.083
and try and keep your head
at a level

01:14:19.083 --> 01:14:21.333
that you enjoy being
most of the day.

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:25.000
The object is
to cut them all even.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.917
- Right.
- So I don't look like--funny.

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:32.709
Ow! It hurts!

01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:36.792
We cover them with myth.

01:14:36.792 --> 01:14:39.208
The parent is always
a mythological figure.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.208
It's the basis
of all mythology,
after all.

01:14:42.208 --> 01:14:44.083
With Zeus...

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:47.625
he says-- You know,
he's the father.

01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:51.375
He's the guy who throws
the thunderbolts.

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:54.166
Kills you, or raises you up...

01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:56.875
into glory.

01:15:01.041 --> 01:15:04.208
Rebecca:
Do you remember
when Danny was born?

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:07.625
Bob:
Dad called and said that

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:10.583
it was a Down syndrome baby,
that the baby was a boy,

01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:14.083
and that he and Inge
were deciding what to do,

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:16.208
and I think I may have said,
"Well, what do you mean?"

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.750
and he said, "Well...

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:22.583
we may decide that he'll be
better off in an institution."

01:15:22.583 --> 01:15:24.875
The way he put it was,

01:15:24.875 --> 01:15:30.166
"The doctors said this is
probably what we should do.

01:15:30.166 --> 01:15:34.917
Woman:
Back then they were told to
not bring the children home

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:38.208
and for them to grow up
in another environment.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.959
Rebecca: So, the reason
I'm not showing my brother
in this film

01:16:21.959 --> 01:16:24.083
is to protect his privacy.

01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:27.333
But he does have
a very happy life now,

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.959
and an independent life,

01:16:29.959 --> 01:16:33.834
and we've become very close.

01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:36.792
My mother visited my brother
all of her life,

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:41.166
but she was somewhat
isolated in that.

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:43.458
Over the years,

01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:46.458
my father visited him
more and more

01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:51.125
and he developed
more and more of
a relationship with him.

01:16:51.125 --> 01:16:53.917
But publically,
he never mentioned him,

01:16:53.917 --> 01:16:58.250
and he wasn't in
the autobiography--

01:16:58.250 --> 01:17:01.291
it wasn't easy
for either of my parents

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:04.333
to talk about him.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:08.750
I had the opportunity to finish
this film in the 1990s,

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:12.583
but I didn't know
how to finish the film

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:14.583
without talking about
my brother,

01:17:14.583 --> 01:17:17.125
and I didn't really know
how to do that.

01:17:17.125 --> 01:17:19.834
And I told my father this,

01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:23.500
and he offered to do
an interview about it.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:25.875
And I put it off.

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:29.709
And I put it off
for a long time.

01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:32.834
And I had children,

01:17:32.834 --> 01:17:36.625
and I started making
other films,

01:17:36.625 --> 01:17:40.041
and...he died.

01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:43.000
And now we'll never know

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.875
what that interview
would have said.

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:02.750
Lyndon Johnson:
I have today ordered to Vietnam
125,000 men...

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:05.417
...that this is really war.

01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:15.166
Miller:
I was more of a rebel
than a revolutionary

01:18:15.166 --> 01:18:16.959
in that situation.

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:19.458
I wanted to protest,
but I didn't want

01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:22.959
to establish a new rule
of violence--

01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.834
and some of them did.

01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:27.583
But many of 'em
were very brave people.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:32.250
Reporter:
Mr. Miller, why did you
refuse the invitation

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:34.458
of President Johnson
to come to Washington

01:18:34.458 --> 01:18:36.417
to witness
the signing of this bill?

01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:40.083
Miller:
I have very strong feelings
that we are at a crisis

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:43.166
where the president must act
in a way that he's not acting.

01:18:43.166 --> 01:18:46.000
This seems like endless war.

01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:51.333
Bob:
He, I think, obviously
supported the politics

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:54.333
of what was going on,
and as it became less political,

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:56.792
and had to do
with smoking dope

01:18:56.792 --> 01:18:58.041
and so on and so forth,

01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:00.959
he was pretty mystified.

01:19:00.959 --> 01:19:04.125
And the '60s
was a total upheaval.

01:19:05.291 --> 01:19:08.000
Not just for me,
but in general.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.875
And I couldn't, really,
satisfactorily,

01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:15.917
express my-- my sense of...

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:17.834
uh, the time.

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:22.625
The theater
had lost its prestige.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:25.125
The young folks

01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:27.875
were looking in an entirely
different direction

01:19:27.875 --> 01:19:30.750
for their ideas
and for their feelings.

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:34.667
I remember I had a very
successful play, "The Price,"

01:19:34.667 --> 01:19:35.834
at that time.

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:40.208
Kushner:
It's the first time

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:44.291
that he really just sort of
announced a kind of Yiddish...

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:49.333
it's not shtick,
but that diction.

01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:51.834
And he had such a phenomenal ear
for it.

01:19:51.834 --> 01:19:53.542
Gregory Solomon:
You called me,
so I came.

01:19:53.542 --> 01:19:56.000
What should I do,
lay down and die?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.166
In "Salesman," the family
could be a Protestant family.

01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:02.834
Certainly the people
in "View From the Bridge"
are Italian-Americans.

01:20:02.834 --> 01:20:06.208
In "Crucible," he worked
to find a constrained

01:20:06.208 --> 01:20:08.333
early American speech
for those people.

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:12.208
And then you finally feel
when the junk dealer
shows up in that attic...

01:20:12.208 --> 01:20:14.208
Woman:
Will you be very long,
Mr. Solomon?

01:20:14.208 --> 01:20:16.959
Gregory Solomon:
Well, with furniture,
you never know--

01:20:16.959 --> 01:20:20.875
can be short, can be long--
can be medium.

01:20:20.875 --> 01:20:23.208
And it's like, "Ahh...
there it is."

01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:25.875
Mike Wallace:
How Jewish are you?

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:28.625
Miller:
Absolutely Jewish, sure.

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:32.959
But I just inherited,
I think from my father,

01:20:32.959 --> 01:20:36.000
the attitude
of being an American

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.041
more than a Jew.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:45.875
Miller:
Even though my play
was successful,

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:50.667
I had wonderful people in it,
it was very nicely done,

01:20:50.667 --> 01:20:54.208
but you got the feeling
it didn't matter anymore.

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:59.375
The whole game
was not worth the candle.

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:02.875
So you made people
feel this or feel that

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:04.750
or laugh or weep--

01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:06.625
so, what the hell's
the difference?

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:08.041
What's the point of it all?

01:21:25.583 --> 01:21:28.375
Miller: I didn't feel
there was anybody out there

01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:31.291
who was interested--
I felt I was shouting
into a barrel.

01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:37.625
For example,
this whole Cain and Abel story.

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:41.166
It was to reverse
the usual process.

01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.709
The usual process is,

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:44.792
there's God,
and he creates the people.

01:21:44.792 --> 01:21:47.959
In my play, the people
are there first,

01:21:47.959 --> 01:21:50.291
and they create the god.

01:21:50.291 --> 01:21:52.125
Whom they proceed to obey

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:54.250
and adorn with
all kinds of powers.

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.834
What it was
was an attempt to show

01:21:56.834 --> 01:22:00.458
why there had to be some kind
of a moral system,

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:03.333
or there would be
the end of the world.

01:22:05.792 --> 01:22:08.500
I thought that was interesting,
but nobody got it.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:13.000
Not very-- really very much.

01:22:15.834 --> 01:22:18.083
Rebecca:
My perception
as I grew up,

01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:20.583
which was basically
the '70s,

01:22:20.583 --> 01:22:25.917
was that you had
a lot of disappointments

01:22:25.917 --> 01:22:28.917
in the theater
during that time.

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:33.834
Mostly, I would say. Yeah.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.750
Uh...

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.667
I agree with you.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.291
It was horrifying.
I mean, the way Arthur
was treated by critics,

01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:51.041
is, you know-- if anybody
cares about theater criticism,

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:55.208
they should certainly feel
that it is a permanent
mark of shame.

01:22:55.208 --> 01:22:58.750
Just dismissing play
after play after play,

01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:00.875
and sort of "Well, you know,
it's just..."

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.000
And with a kind of laziness,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.208
just this kind of,
"Why do we care what
this old man

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:08.583
has to say about anything?"

01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:13.208
Rebecca: Did you ever feel that

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:15.834
you were losing
your muse?

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:22.125
I felt that I was out of place,
more than anything else.

01:23:22.125 --> 01:23:23.792
I tell you why, concretely,

01:23:23.792 --> 01:23:27.417
it's because in Europe
my stuff was always accepted.

01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:32.125
It worked on-- whether it be
in Britain or Germany...

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:34.917
very often France, Italy.

01:23:37.041 --> 01:23:39.709
Rebecca: I think it was hurtful
for him that in his own country

01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:41.625
he was dismissed.

01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:44.834
But he also had
this kind of ebullience

01:23:44.834 --> 01:23:47.250
and belief in himself
that just kept bubbling up,

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:50.959
you know, that was
his essential life-force.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:54.250
8:00, he was at his desk,
and he'd come down at noon.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:57.500
It was like punching
a timeclock, I mean,
this to him was a--

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.083
he had a workingman's schedule,

01:24:00.083 --> 01:24:02.959
like a blue collar ethic
of his.

01:24:02.959 --> 01:24:06.750
You know, and my father,
when he wasn't working
on his plays

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:09.792
or when he wasn't writing,
in terms of our everyday life,

01:24:09.792 --> 01:24:12.291
it was all oriented
around work.

01:24:12.291 --> 01:24:15.959
His idea was like,
"If you can make it yourself,

01:24:15.959 --> 01:24:17.667
you should make it yourself."

01:24:17.667 --> 01:24:19.875
He made the coffee table,
he made the dining table,

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:23.625
he made the bookshelves
himself.

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.625
I remember when I asked
for a stereo

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.959
when I was
something like 14 years old.

01:24:27.959 --> 01:24:31.166
Instead of getting the plastic
stereo that I was hoping for,

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:34.917
that everyone else had,
my father made me a stereo
out of wood.

01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:37.792
And he had found
these enormous knobs

01:24:37.792 --> 01:24:39.875
out of--from the dump.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:43.709
- Do you still write?
- Writing every day,
right up in that building.

01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:46.834
- Plays?
- Yeah. I'm writing
a play now.

01:24:46.834 --> 01:24:49.959
Don't ask me why,
but I love doing it.

01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:53.667
Did some work on that play.

01:24:54.834 --> 01:24:57.166
I think it's pretty good now--

01:24:57.166 --> 01:24:58.875
to my surprise.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.083
Look, you write long enough--

01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:06.750
If you quit, that's one thing.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.542
If you're gonna go on writing,

01:25:09.542 --> 01:25:15.291
the art is to turn your back on
what hasn't worked,

01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:20.834
and go forward to what you think
might well work.

01:25:20.834 --> 01:25:23.709
'Cause a human being
is many-faceted,

01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:26.959
there are all kinds
of different emotions

01:25:26.959 --> 01:25:29.667
and attitudes
that we're all capable of,

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:33.625
and you gotta find those
that communicate something.

01:25:33.625 --> 01:25:35.834
I never blame other people.

01:25:35.834 --> 01:25:37.542
You can't do that.

01:25:37.542 --> 01:25:38.917
'Cause it's not true.

01:25:41.375 --> 01:25:44.417
One day they'll catch up
with something, or they won't.

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:49.500
But the voice is
the important thing,

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:53.041
that you don't go silent.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.375
Rebecca:
Speeding? OK.

01:25:57.375 --> 01:25:59.041
Man: Yeah, 39 and 8.

01:25:59.041 --> 01:26:00.000
OK, Pop.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.417
Yeah, we're on.

01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:06.458
All right, this is
not so much a play

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:11.208
as an exploration
of an area between
life and death.

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:14.875
And it may someday be a play;

01:26:14.875 --> 01:26:18.834
at the moment,
it's simply a long fragment.

01:26:18.834 --> 01:26:21.208
Miller:
Well, the play I'm doing now

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:24.834
is basically an instinctual
piece of work.

01:26:24.834 --> 01:26:28.250
"People want. They want,
and they don't know
what they want.

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:31.375
The American closet is full
of perfectly good clothes

01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:33.458
that they can't see themselves
wearing anymore.

01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:37.583
Miller:
Instinctual in the sense
that I'm relying on the fact

01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:40.792
that inside of my head,

01:26:40.792 --> 01:26:43.291
there is a structure,

01:26:43.291 --> 01:26:47.250
whose outlines
I can't detect at this point,

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:50.333
but whose emotional sound

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:53.542
and weight and color

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.250
I feel very strongly.

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:59.125
I wouldn't have done that
25 years ago.

01:26:59.125 --> 01:27:01.083
- You see?
- Rebecca: Mm-hmm.

01:27:01.083 --> 01:27:03.959
But in this play,
what's making you write,

01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:05.959
what's the theme
that's pushing you ahead?

01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:08.625
Or is there one?

01:27:08.625 --> 01:27:14.125
I think it's more--
it's less a theme
than an air of wonder...

01:27:14.125 --> 01:27:18.166
an air of wonder
and amusement...

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:22.125
at people.

01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:25.834
And how...

01:27:25.834 --> 01:27:28.250
how wonderful they are.

01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:30.792
- Man: It's excellent!
- Inge: I love it!

01:27:30.792 --> 01:27:34.208
That's as far as I got.

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:36.250
Inge: It's really great.

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:38.125
It's fun, isn't it?

01:27:38.125 --> 01:27:39.625
Rebecca: Oh, yeah,
you gotta--

01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:42.000
It's all one improvisation
after another.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Inge: Yeah,
but it's marvelous.

01:27:51.792 --> 01:27:54.667
Well, here it is.

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:58.041
Young Man: Well,
what would you say God is?

01:27:58.041 --> 01:27:59.583
Or is that too definite?

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:01.041
Mr. Peters:
Not at all.

01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:06.709
God is precisely
what is not there
when you need Him.

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:11.375
Arthur, it's just like
a great jazz riff.
It's so bold.

01:28:11.375 --> 01:28:13.542
Well, that's what
I was trying to get at.

01:28:13.542 --> 01:28:16.000
But do you think
there is a critic in New York

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.166
who's gonna see that?

01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:31.375
Miller:
Well, what can I say?

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:33.291
What was his thrust?

01:28:33.291 --> 01:28:35.250
Basically, that it was boring.

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:38.792
He saw no insights in it,
he saw nothing much in it.

01:28:38.792 --> 01:28:41.041
Inge:
This is Lola Cavindo,

01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:43.375
whom I called
on the mobile telephone.

01:28:43.375 --> 01:28:46.583
She said that in the ABC
was a big article

01:28:46.583 --> 01:28:48.542
loving "Mr. Peters' Connection."

01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:51.208
Some Spanish person saw it.

01:28:51.208 --> 01:28:52.959
And it was a big thing,

01:28:52.959 --> 01:28:55.333
and it's the "año
of Arthur Miller,"

01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:59.709
and "nominado para  Tony,
y todo, y todo, y todo."

01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:04.583
She's very excited,
and she says she never
reads reviews anyway.

01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:07.417
It will have to...

01:29:07.417 --> 01:29:10.625
find another way
to penetrate.

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.583
'Cause this will kill it...

01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:14.250
for this run.

01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:19.750
But I have no questions
about it. It'll come back.

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:22.542
Art is long.

01:29:22.542 --> 01:29:25.083
Rebecca:
What do you mean?

01:29:25.083 --> 01:29:27.583
Life is short.

01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:30.709
I forgot the Latin.

01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:32.709
You gave her
Mama's stockings.

01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:34.583
I gave you an order!

01:29:34.583 --> 01:29:36.333
Don't touch me,
you liar!

01:29:36.333 --> 01:29:37.792
You apologize
for that!

01:29:37.792 --> 01:29:39.458
You fake!

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:43.458
Rebecca:
That Dustin Hoffman
revival of "Salesman"

01:29:43.458 --> 01:29:45.834
was the beginning
of a kind of renaissance--

01:29:45.834 --> 01:29:48.291
all the old plays
started to get done again

01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:50.500
in this country
and all over the world.

01:29:56.625 --> 01:29:59.792
Miller:
It's the happiest thing
in my professional life,

01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:01.041
I think.

01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:09.959
I mean, some of these plays
are 50 years old.

01:30:09.959 --> 01:30:12.625
There aren't many things
in this culture

01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:16.041
that are 50 years old
that are still usable.

01:30:16.041 --> 01:30:18.625
Rebecca:
"'A View From the Bridge'

01:30:18.625 --> 01:30:20.792
prompts something
of the emotional response

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:23.000
one is supposed to feel,
but seldom does,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.750
when seeing 'King Lear'
or 'Oedipus Rex.'

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.250
Mr. Miller again shows us
that contemporary plays

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:30.792
can still move, disturb,
provoke, and even shock."

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.417
Inge:
Pretty good!

01:30:32.417 --> 01:30:38.291
Miller: Well, you see,
if you wait long enough...

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:41.500
"The Crucible"
is gonna start shooting

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.959
in about a week.

01:30:43.959 --> 01:30:47.000
My son Bobby is producing it--
your brother.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.750
Rebecca:
I know.

01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:52.417
Miller:
Yeah, they built a whole town
on an island,

01:30:52.417 --> 01:30:54.458
unbelievably enough,

01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:56.959
off the coast
of Massachusetts.

01:30:56.959 --> 01:31:00.709
It really looks like--
you walk in there,

01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:02.959
and you're in
a different time.

01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:04.750
It's like a dream!

01:31:07.375 --> 01:31:09.208
Rebecca: But it's amazing,
isn't it,

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:12.583
that they're doing
all these plays now
at once?

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:14.375
What do you think
that is?

01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:17.709
I really don't know.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.375
Well...

01:31:22.375 --> 01:31:25.500
it happens in life,
you know?

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:26.834
Occasionally.

01:31:26.834 --> 01:31:28.792
People suddenly wake up
and say,

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:31.125
"Oh, yeah, that."

01:31:31.125 --> 01:31:33.458
And they do them.

01:31:33.458 --> 01:31:36.250
But I wouldn't take it
too seriously.

01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:41.041
They'll forget about 'em
soon enough.

01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:44.375
Don't be so pessimistic!

01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:49.709
Pessimism is one defense
I have against optimism.

01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:53.917
There's your mother,
crawling down the hill.

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:56.500
- See the path I cut there?
- Inge: Yeah, we went there.

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.250
Rebecca:
We went in there already.

01:31:58.250 --> 01:32:00.500
- Isn't that a nice path?
- It's beautiful.

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.083
Inge:
It's beautiful!

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:05.083
You can go right onto the brook
and then up in the--

01:32:05.083 --> 01:32:07.375
Tomorrow we should make
a longer walk,

01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:10.208
up in the woods
with a hard-boiled egg.

01:32:10.208 --> 01:32:13.208
Yes, we can plant
a hard-boiled egg in the woods.

01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:16.917
That's a pretty one.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:33.709
Rebecca:
She used to go on trips
to photograph various things.

01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:35.333
And she would go
for about two weeks,

01:32:35.333 --> 01:32:37.834
She realized he could stand it
for two weeks

01:32:37.834 --> 01:32:39.291
to be on his own.

01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:40.917
You want the wing?

01:32:40.917 --> 01:32:42.667
Why not?

01:32:42.667 --> 01:32:44.750
Rebecca: And then
she had to come back.

01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:48.917
Well, you know,
to be a couple is--

01:32:48.917 --> 01:32:50.417
is work.

01:32:50.417 --> 01:32:51.667
Mix up the salad.

01:32:51.667 --> 01:32:53.000
Mix up the salad.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.083
I have to warm.
Otherwise, it gets cold.

01:32:55.083 --> 01:32:57.417
It's not warm,
it's not right.

01:32:57.417 --> 01:32:59.125
Inge:
I've lived alone a long time,

01:32:59.125 --> 01:33:01.709
and I totally enjoyed
living alone.

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:03.458
But now I'm--

01:33:03.458 --> 01:33:08.458
Well, it's a kind of a mutual
love and respect,

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:11.000
and to be there for somebody,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.250
and somebody there for you,
is wonderful.

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:15.291
- See where this stick is?
- Yeah?

01:33:15.291 --> 01:33:18.000
Well, it should go...

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.667
Miller:
They're naming a street
after her. Did you know that?

01:33:20.667 --> 01:33:22.500
Rebecca:
I didn't know that.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.166
- Inge: In the village.
- It's gonna be
Calle Inge Morath.

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.917
- Where?
- In a Spanish village.

01:33:26.917 --> 01:33:30.166
They saw their photographs,
you know, in the Spanish show.

01:33:30.166 --> 01:33:33.500
They couldn't believe it.
They said, "You put us
into history!

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.166
Could we name a street
after you?"

01:33:35.166 --> 01:33:37.834
They're making a big festivity
on the 12th.

01:33:37.834 --> 01:33:42.625
Miller:
We did a couple of books,
one about China, about Russia,

01:33:42.625 --> 01:33:46.500
about the countryside here,

01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:51.875
an intimate coming-together
between two disciplines.

01:33:51.875 --> 01:33:54.417
She's just terrific.
Let's face it.

01:33:54.417 --> 01:33:57.500
I can say that after--
how many years?

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.875
35 years? Married to her.

01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:01.500
That's a long time.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.000
It's longer than that.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.667
Longer? Yeah.

01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:07.667
But it seemed like a day.

01:34:07.667 --> 01:34:11.542
Rebecca:
Inge was diagnosed
with lymphoma,

01:34:11.542 --> 01:34:13.875
and she lived with it
for a couple of years,

01:34:13.875 --> 01:34:16.041
and Arthur was
very close by her.

01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:20.542
But then suddenly
she got very sick and died.

01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:23.583
And that came
as a shock to him.

01:34:23.583 --> 01:34:27.959
It felt like the death of
a very young woman, strangely.

01:34:27.959 --> 01:34:32.375
And he was quite lost
after that.

01:34:34.625 --> 01:34:37.500
Nichols:
When your mother died
I wrote him a letter,

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:40.750
and I got such a letter back.

01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:43.750
And the letter ended about

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:47.208
how what he realized now

01:34:47.208 --> 01:34:49.750
was that we're all
hanging by a thread.

01:34:59.083 --> 01:35:02.125
Man: You ever think
of what your obituary
might mean or say,

01:35:02.125 --> 01:35:03.709
and what you would
want it to say?

01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:05.750
What would you
want it to say?

01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:08.917
- "Writer."
- Writer.

01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:13.750
Well, tell me more.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:17.417
That's all.
That...should say it.

01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:22.458
Rebecca:
All right. You set?

01:35:22.458 --> 01:35:24.000
OK, Pop!

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.750
Miller:
There are thousands of plays
that come and go

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:40.500
and nobody can sustain
any great interest in them

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.917
over any period of time.

01:35:42.917 --> 01:35:46.542
But for works of any degree
of seriousness,

01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:49.625
they're presenting
some question

01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:51.667
as to what is real

01:35:51.667 --> 01:35:55.125
and what is simply ephemera.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.834
I mean, no play is finished;

01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:01.542
plays are abandoned.

01:36:01.542 --> 01:36:05.500
And they're abandoned because
you can only get so close,

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.625
and then it doesn't allow you
to come any closer.

01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:11.417
Rebecca:
Close to...?

01:36:11.417 --> 01:36:14.542
To the hidden narrative,

01:36:14.542 --> 01:36:18.333
hidden truth
of what's goin' on.

01:36:18.333 --> 01:36:21.208
It reminds me a little bit
of the idea of Kabbalah, even.

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:25.500
Yeah. I think that's a--
there is a resemblance.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.667
It's almost as though
the human being is a work
of the imagination,

01:36:29.667 --> 01:36:33.375
of somebody's imagination,
maybe God's imagination.

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:36.500
So do you think that
a play is a great play

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.375
because it reflects something
deeply about human nature,

01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:45.083
or that is has some little bit
of what you would call,
in this case, "God" in it?

01:36:45.083 --> 01:36:48.083
I'm not sure what it's saying
about human nature,

01:36:48.083 --> 01:36:52.709
I think it's the process
of approaching

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:57.041
the unwritten and the unspoken
and the unspeakable.

01:36:57.041 --> 01:37:01.500
And the closer you get to it,
the more life there seems to be.

01:37:05.542 --> 01:37:08.125
Miller: I have lived
more than half my life

01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:10.000
in the Connecticut countryside,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.959
all the time expecting to get
some play or book finished,

01:37:12.959 --> 01:37:15.709
so I can spend more time
in the city,

01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:18.959
where everything is happening.

01:37:18.959 --> 01:37:22.625
But little happens here
that I don't make happen,

01:37:22.625 --> 01:37:25.333
except the sun
coming up and going down

01:37:25.333 --> 01:37:28.083
and the leaves emerging
and dropping off,

01:37:28.083 --> 01:37:30.083
and an occasional surprise,

01:37:30.083 --> 01:37:34.375
like the recent appearance
of coyotes in the woods.

01:37:36.333 --> 01:37:38.250
And I am in this room,

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:41.000
from which I can sometimes
look out at dusk,

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.083
and see them warily moving

01:37:43.083 --> 01:37:45.291
through the barren
winter trees,

01:37:45.291 --> 01:37:48.208
and I am, I suppose,
doing what they're doing--

01:37:48.208 --> 01:37:52.375
making myself possible
for those who come after me.

01:37:54.417 --> 01:37:58.583
I am a mystery to them
until they tire of it
and move on,

01:37:58.583 --> 01:38:01.625
but the truth--
the first truth, probably--

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:05.542
is that we are all connected,
watching one another,

01:38:05.542 --> 01:38:07.625
even the trees.
