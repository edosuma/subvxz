00:03.436 --> 00:06.072
I’m just a little tensed
about my dad’s visit.

00:06.106 --> 00:08.775
Now, I want this visit
to be perfect.

00:08.809 --> 00:12.345
This is my chance to show dad
I’ve made it on my own.

00:12.378 --> 00:14.314
And when he see’s the life
I’ve made for myself

00:14.347 --> 00:16.550
he’ll be so proud of me,
he’ll say

00:16.583 --> 00:19.219
"Well done, son."

00:19.252 --> 00:21.822
I still have the bat
Mickey Mantle autographed.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.357
It wasn’t Mickey Mantle,
it was Roger Maris.

00:24.390 --> 00:27.393
It was Mickey Mantle
a‐and I can prove it.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.563
I‐I have the bat right here
in the closet.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.598
The bat’s in the basement.

It‐it‐it won’t turn, dad.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.478
Well, no wonder. It’s rusted.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.848
And how do we get rid
of rust, son?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.517
We knock it off with a hammer.

You just locked us all in.

01:08.301 --> 01:10.436
Wait a minute.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.273
This place is gonna
fill up with water.

01:13.306 --> 01:16.476
‐I don’t wanna drown!
‐Nobody’s gonna drown.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.412
By the time the water reaches
this fuse box...

Cousin, cousin.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.784
We’ve been screaming for an hour
and if we keep it up

03:03.817 --> 03:06.820
we’re going to do some permanent
damage to our vocal cords.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.843

in his eyes.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.295
Normally that scares me

but when
you’re thigh‐deep in water

you lower your expectation.

Now, cousin, this is no time

‐I don’t believe it.
‐There.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.063
One problem solved.

Well, cousin, I must say

04:25.398 --> 04:28.001
this time
you really used your head.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.336
That was a really good idea,
Larry.

[rumbling]

04:31.638 --> 04:33.406
Well, I just spotted the problem

of the old Appleton know‐how.

05:12.078 --> 05:14.648
Yes, cousin, you’re right

05:14.681 --> 05:16.850

your letting me take the shot.

do something.

We’re four inches
from being deep‐fried.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.472
Actually,
it’s three and a half inches.

05:42.442 --> 05:45.411
Don’t worry. I’ve got another
plan to get us out of here.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.880
You have another plan?

05:46.913 --> 05:49.650
You call sticking a head
in the pipe a plan?

05:50.450 --> 05:51.818
It was a good plan.

Alright, now,
now listen to me, everyone.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.762
This is no time to lose hope

06:01.795 --> 06:04.164
because if we all
put our heads together

I’m sure
we can think of something.

to knock the door down with.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.729
Hey, cousin

06:35.762 --> 06:38.699
maybe we could knock the door
down with one of these beams.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.504
Good idea, Balki.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.172
Alright, l‐let’s get
this beam over to the stairs.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.009
Okay, Balki, you take that end

06:49.042 --> 06:51.144
and I’ll get this end.

‐I’m okay. I’m okay.

Alright, alright,

Yeah. Yeah. Oh, good.

into the door.

I think we should say
ready, set, go.

Dad, I think there are times
when a ready, set, go

08:01.114 --> 08:02.148
is called for

08:02.182 --> 08:04.718

this is one of those times.

have you knocked down?

if we say one, two, three

ready, set, go?

08:22.202 --> 08:24.938

08:32.846 --> 08:35.248

08:35.280 --> 08:37.918

a little more weight behind us.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.854
Jennifer, Mary Anne, Lydia,
give us a hand.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.789
I don’t know, son, I...

08:42.823 --> 08:45.726
I don’t, I don’t think
this landing can hold all of us.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.793
Trust me, dad.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.663
Lawrence, if the four of us
just keep hitting it

08:49.696 --> 08:52.566
the door will give way,
eventually.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.735
But that could take all night,
dad. It stands to reason.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.904
The more people, the more force,
the quicker we’ll open the door.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.305
And it’s my beam.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.311
And a very handsome beam it is,
too, cousin

09:05.345 --> 09:07.614
but I think the point
your father is trying to make

09:07.648 --> 09:10.751
is that this landing
may not be able to support

09:10.784 --> 09:12.886
seven people and your beam.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.255
So prove me wrong.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.858
Come on, ladies.
Let’s put our backs into it.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.327
Oh, no.
I hope I don’t break a nail.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.902
Alright,
on the count of three. Ready?

09:28.935 --> 09:32.739
One, two, three!

09:33.173 --> 09:34.340
[thud]

09:37.243 --> 09:40.146
Well, it didn’t
knock down the door.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.883
Well, it didn’t knock
the landing down, either.

So we’ve had a little setback.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.421
A little setback?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.390
You mean, like, the Titanic
had a little setback?

10:26.392 --> 10:27.861
At least I tried.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.429
I don’t hear anybody else
coming up with a plan

10:29.462 --> 10:30.697
to get us out of here.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.865
You’re right, son.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.835
‐You did have a plan.
‐Thanks, dad.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.270
Just wasn’t a very good one.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.106
Ah. Well,
I was only trying to help.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.175

Go play in the deep end.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.317
Shame on you.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.787
Didn’t you ever make a mistake?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.756
Yeah. Coming to this party.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.228
It’s getting deeper.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.163
If we don’t get out of here soon

11:03.196 --> 11:05.265
we might as well
forget about the party.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.871
Cousin, um

11:10.904 --> 11:14.708
the‐the‐the festive mood
seems to be slipping away.

11:14.741 --> 11:18.912
Everyone seems to be
getting cranky.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.447
That’s because they’re going
to die, and it’s all my fault.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.385
They hate me, don’t they?

11:25.418 --> 11:28.088
Well, of course they don’t.
Don’t be ridiculous.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.326
I wanted this to be a weekend
my father would never forget.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.362
Now I’ve killed him.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.900
Well, it will be a weekend

11:39.933 --> 11:42.335
your, your, your mother
will never forget.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.409
And I’ll die without ever
making my father proud of me.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.177
Cousin, you know...

11:51.211 --> 11:52.979
...maybe your father
is proud of you

11:53.013 --> 11:54.047
and you just don’t know it.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.448
Well, he’s never said so.

11:55.481 --> 11:59.085
Well, he, fathers don’t
always say what they feel.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.923
Cousin, if you tell your father

12:02.956 --> 12:04.224
how you feel

12:04.257 --> 12:07.193
maybe you will be surprised
at how he feels.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.533
Well, I‐I would, but...

12:12.566 --> 12:14.935
Yeah, but I just don’t know
how to get started.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.503
Well, I’m gonna help you.

12:16.537 --> 12:17.604
‐Uncle Walter.
‐Oh, no.

12:17.638 --> 12:19.873
Would you swim over here
for just a moment, please?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.508
Cousin Larry has something
he want to tell you.

12:21.542 --> 12:22.909
‐No, no.
‐Cousin, cousin.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.210
Just open your mouth

12:24.244 --> 12:26.179
and let your heart
do the talking.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.114
What is it, son?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.184
Dad, I...

12:33.854 --> 12:35.155
B‐Balki, could you...

12:36.022 --> 12:37.423
...give us a minute?

12:49.603 --> 12:52.873
Dad, we may not have
much time left

12:52.906 --> 12:55.542
but we need to talk,
you and me.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.478
You and I, Lawrence.

12:58.512 --> 12:59.780
You and I.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.516
W‐well, it’s not so much
you and I

13:02.549 --> 13:04.551
i‐it’s more you.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.855
Well, it’s you
when you’re r‐relating to me.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.456
To I. To‐to me.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.527
Lawrence, if you want
a career in journalism

13:13.560 --> 13:16.863
you’ve got to be
more articulate.

13:16.897 --> 13:20.200
Well, t‐this is exactly
what I’m talking about.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.003
Nothing I do
is ever good enough for you.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.407
When I was in sixth grade
I got a 96 on a test.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.411
You, you asked what happened
to the other four points.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.580
And now I’ve got a good job
at the newspaper

13:33.614 --> 13:36.249
you tell me
I should work in television.

13:36.282 --> 13:39.019
When are you gonna be
proud of me?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.387
Lawrence,
I’ve always been proud of you.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.258
Well, all you do is criticize.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.528
Just once
I’d like to hear you say

13:47.561 --> 13:49.195
"Well done, son."

13:51.031 --> 13:52.999
I, I know I criticize you a lot

13:53.033 --> 13:56.402
but it’s only because I want you
to be the best you can be.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.572
For heaven’s sake,
I’m always bragging about you.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.342
I tell everyone what a,
what a wonderful son I have.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.912
But you never tell me.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.050
I don’t, do I?

14:12.986 --> 14:14.588
I’ve always found it hard

14:14.621 --> 14:18.024
to express my feelings...

14:19.560 --> 14:21.494
...to those
that I love the most.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.499
And I love you, Lawrence.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.503
[instrumental music]

14:31.104 --> 14:33.073
I love you, too, dad.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.522
[panting]

14:54.561 --> 14:57.130
‐Thank God!
‐Balki.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.533
Could, could you give us
just, uh, another minute?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.635
‐Huh?
‐Please?

15:14.748 --> 15:17.383
Except for the fact
that we’re going to die soon...

15:18.284 --> 15:20.220
...I’ve never been happier.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.656
Well, we’re not dead yet

15:22.689 --> 15:24.991
so let’s try to find a way
to get out of here.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.159
[chuckles]

15:26.192 --> 15:29.162
[water bubbling]

15:30.296 --> 15:31.532
[grunting]

15:31.565 --> 15:32.699
Balki!

15:33.567 --> 15:35.068
Just kidding, cousin.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.103
Cousins should joke more!

15:37.137 --> 15:38.138
[laughs]

15:40.306 --> 15:42.008
Come on, we’re gonna
find a way out of here.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.545
Cousin, you know,
I wish MacGyver were here.

15:44.578 --> 15:47.013
That man
could take a Hershey bar

15:47.047 --> 15:49.149
a thumbtack and a rubber band

15:49.182 --> 15:51.685
and make a bomb that would blow
the socks off that door.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.054
Well, MacGyver’s
got nothing on Lawrence.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.488
Remember when you got
that chemistry set

15:55.522 --> 15:57.157
and you blew up the garage?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.359
Yeah. I loved
that chemistry set.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.427
It was the best
Christmas present I ever got.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.730
I believe
it was a birthday present.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.066
No, dad, I distinctly remember‐‐

16:06.099 --> 16:08.034
Cousin, cousin, cousin

16:08.068 --> 16:10.537
i‐is that the chemistry set
you won’t let me play with?

16:10.571 --> 16:14.074
Balki, it’s dangerous. That’s
why we keep it in the basement.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.344
‐The basement!
‐The basement!

16:18.378 --> 16:20.013
Guys! Guys!

16:20.046 --> 16:23.049
That chemistry set
could be in the basement!

16:23.083 --> 16:26.019
[instrumental music]

16:32.526 --> 16:33.627
(Larry)
Sulfur.

16:37.598 --> 16:39.666
‐Potash.
‐ Gesundheit.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.371
Give me the potash.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.211
There.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.282
Was it 75% fulminate of zinc

16:56.316 --> 16:58.785
or potassium nitrate?

16:58.819 --> 17:01.655
Who are we kidding? He can’t
even make instant coffee.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.257
Listen, pal.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.259
If my son can blow up
an entire garage

17:06.291 --> 17:08.294
he can certainly blow up
a little door.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.396
Thanks, dad.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.470
Come on, Larry, you can do it.

17:17.503 --> 17:20.574
I don’t know.
It’s not coming back to me.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.143
Well, if it were me, Larry,
I’d go with 10% potash

17:23.175 --> 17:25.712
15% sulfur and 75% zinc.

17:30.751 --> 17:32.719
We used to summer in Beirut.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.429
Alright.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.499
I think we’re ready.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.572
Now I need something to use
as a fuse.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.808
Uh, how about your tie?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.244
Mine won’t work. It’s wet.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.848
We could use Mr. Gorpley’s tie.

18:01.882 --> 18:05.218
It’s dry and it’s making
a nifty fashion statement.

18:06.319 --> 18:09.556
Wait a minute.
This is a $50 tie.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.792
‐Ooh!
‐Just give them the tie, Sam.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.327
Okay, it’s yours.

18:23.504 --> 18:25.438
Alright, now I need something
to light it with.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.308
Oh, wait.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.412
Dad.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.715
It’s the lighter I gave you
when I was ten.

18:34.748 --> 18:36.817
Yes, it is.

18:37.651 --> 18:38.885
And you were eleven.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.891
Alright, Balki,
lift me up on your shoulders

18:44.925 --> 18:46.793
so I can reach the doorknob.

18:46.827 --> 18:49.796
[dramatic music]

18:58.839 --> 19:00.941
Uh, come on, girls.
Better get down.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.275
This could be dangerous.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.278
[grunting]

19:07.280 --> 19:09.215
[grunting]

19:11.885 --> 19:13.854
‐’Be careful, Larry!’
‐’Let’s go!’

19:13.887 --> 19:16.389
‐’Uh, door, door.’
‐’Hurry, Balki, hurry!’

19:16.422 --> 19:18.391
[indistinct chatter]

19:19.660 --> 19:20.794
[indistinct yelling]

19:26.633 --> 19:29.703
You burned a $50 tie
for nothing?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.705
I could have been buried
in that tie.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.708
[explosion]

19:34.741 --> 19:37.443
[all cheering]

19:38.311 --> 19:39.980
Alright, come on!

19:40.013 --> 19:42.849
‐Let’s get outta here!
‐Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.320
Well done, son.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.456
Now let’s get out of here.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.459
[instrumental music]

19:58.932 --> 20:01.234
Gee, dad, I wish you didn’t
have to leave so soon.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.803
Well, I gotta be back by 7:00

20:02.836 --> 20:06.372
and if I leave now, I’ll miss
the rush hour on I‐94.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.274
Oh! Oh, uh, dad...

20:08.308 --> 20:10.977
‐Uh, your shoes are still wet.
‐Oh.

20:11.011 --> 20:13.313
But I stuffed them with paper

20:13.346 --> 20:14.815
so they’ll be okay
’til you get home.

20:14.848 --> 20:16.449
Well, now,
if you get your shoes wet

20:16.482 --> 20:17.751
and you don’t put
shoe trees in ’em

20:17.784 --> 20:19.252
you can kiss ’em goodbye.

20:19.285 --> 20:22.422
Well, no, dad, the paper
will absorb the moisture.

20:22.455 --> 20:25.959
Lawrence, how many shoes
have you dried?

20:26.993 --> 20:28.428
Today? Fourteen.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.633
Well, then I guess
you know what you’re doing.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.035
Thanks, dad.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.770
Uncle Walter

20:36.803 --> 20:39.773
I made you a nice, big plate
of moogli boozachmonk

20:39.806 --> 20:41.007
to take back to Madison.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.677
Oh! Well, what is it?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.779
Pig bladder stuffed with cheese.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.483
‐Can I tempt you?
‐Uh...

20:50.517 --> 20:51.785
Maybe later.

20:52.886 --> 20:56.322
Uh, Balki, I can honestly say

20:56.356 --> 20:58.491
that meeting you
is an experience

20:58.525 --> 21:01.061
I will never forget.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.564
You know,
a lot of people say that.

21:04.965 --> 21:07.734
Oh, oh, I‐I almost forgot.

21:07.768 --> 21:10.470
Dad, I wouldn’t eat those

21:10.504 --> 21:12.438
or you’ll be stopping a lot.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.643
Ah. Thank you
for the advice, son.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.313
Oh, thank you, Cousin Larry.

21:21.081 --> 21:22.583
Oh, well...

21:23.784 --> 21:25.418
...thank you.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.688
‐Bye, Balki.
‐Bye, Uncle Walter.

21:28.589 --> 21:29.590
Bye, son.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.625
Goodbye, dad.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.666
Balki, I want to thank you

21:39.700 --> 21:41.535
for making me
have that talk with my dad.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.603
Ah, cousin.

21:42.636 --> 21:43.970
Now, you Mypiots may not have

21:44.004 --> 21:45.806
television or radio

21:45.839 --> 21:48.509
or indoor plumbing

21:48.542 --> 21:50.911
but you really know
how to talk to each other.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.380
There isn’t
that much else to do.

21:56.583 --> 21:59.485
You know, it’s like
we always say on Mypos

21:59.520 --> 22:03.423
"A few well‐chosen words
with a loved one

22:03.456 --> 22:06.092
"are worth more than the picture

22:06.126 --> 22:08.461
"that came with the frame

22:08.494 --> 22:11.765
even if that picture
is Olivia Newton‐John."

22:17.738 --> 22:20.106
Words to live by.

22:20.140 --> 22:21.141
I’ll tell you what?

22:21.174 --> 22:23.777
Let’s just relax
for the rest of the weekend.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.612
Hey, great idea.

22:25.646 --> 22:27.514
What do you say
we go get two towels

22:27.548 --> 22:29.550
go down to the basement
and take a dip?

22:32.185 --> 22:33.520
I’ll call the girls?

22:33.554 --> 22:36.489
[instrumental music]

22:41.461 --> 22:43.897
[theme music]

23:08.822 --> 23:11.792
[music continues]
