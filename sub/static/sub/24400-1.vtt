WEBVTT

00:24.691 --> 00:26.443
Come this way, Terron.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.824
Come on, T. Quick, quick.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.704
Oh!

00:49.215 --> 00:51.593
Let's go, T.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.221
Splash!

01:00.810 --> 01:02.896
Whoo!

01:11.821 --> 01:13.948
Give it back.
You're gonna drop it.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.078
Why are you watching my video anyway?
Watch this.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.831
Oh, yeah, layup.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.292
Right? Stoned.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.086
Is that game?
-No. Ten to two.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.715
-One more and we beat them.
-Come on. I wanna keep playing.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.509
Win already.

01:32.884 --> 01:33.802
All right, whatever.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.680
Let me see that back.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.725
Whoop.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.894
Come on, Terron.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.439
End the game, already. Oh, my God.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.651
Oh, come on.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.069
Damn.

01:58.576 --> 02:02.664
So, picking up from last class,
we're still dealing with probabilities.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.291
But today we're gonna apply them
to your lives.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.961
The chances of doing something.

02:08.044 --> 02:12.757
The odds, the likelihood.
Who's got something?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.135
What draft pick

02:15.218 --> 02:17.595
That's a good one.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.847
Let's look it up.

02:19.722 --> 02:23.184
We can do that as probabilities
and express them as percentages.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.479
Odds of getting into the NBA.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.358
We have 500,000 high school players.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.778
A hundred and fifty thousand are seniors. We have 18,000 college players.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.293
Four thousand of whom are on scholarship.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.337
Sixty NBA draft picks.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.924
Thirty in the first round.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.512
Fourteen lottery picks.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.933
See how I stepped back?
I was like--

03:04.017 --> 03:06.728
Looks like a reverse layup
on Marcus. Man.

03:06.811 --> 03:07.645
And one.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.732
-All right, bro.
-I'm heading out. See you.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.818
All right, bro. See you.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.547
Yo, Pops. Where you at?

03:45.683 --> 03:48.853
Ma, you're probably teaching
right now, but I'm at school.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.980
Dad still hasn't come get me yet.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.234
<i>My phone is about to die, so...</i>
<i>you guys hurry up.</i>

04:40.822 --> 04:43.283
Baby.
What, are you gonna walk the whole way?

04:43.783 --> 04:46.035
What else was I supposed to do?

04:47.829 --> 04:51.791
I'm sorry. We tried to call you,
but we couldn't reach you.

04:51.874 --> 04:52.959
Yeah, my phone died.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.005
-Well, he couldn't find it.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.049
Today is not one of his good days.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.064
I've gotta get my pills. Hold up.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.734
Oh, Vince. I gotta get to class.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.406
They're gonna be done
with their tests by now.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.453
Speaking of tests...

05:31.414 --> 05:32.915
They ain't posted them yet.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.835
It went that badly, huh?

05:37.462 --> 05:41.924
How do you expect me to be great if you
kick me off the team for one bad grade?

05:42.008 --> 05:44.469
Why can't you just let me
give it all I got?

05:46.846 --> 05:47.680
Wait.

05:49.098 --> 05:53.102
When I'm done teaching, why am I
dropping the car off at your dad's work?

05:54.687 --> 05:58.775
So he can drive it back when he
finishes his shift. His double-shift.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.777
And why does he have to do that?

06:01.402 --> 06:04.697
I don't know. Because he got
hit in the head too many times?

06:04.781 --> 06:07.992
-I'm serious, too. It's the truth.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.954
He's doing it because he
"gave it all he got."

06:14.916 --> 06:16.709
I'm not gonna end up like him.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.129
I don't even play the same sport he does.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.131
Did.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.929
-"Riverside" on three. One, two, three.
Riverside.

06:35.770 --> 06:36.854
T, let's go.

06:38.648 --> 06:42.151
Y'all get some popcorn.
There's about to be a show up in here.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.610
You have to put somebody else
on him, coach.

07:25.027 --> 07:28.781
Dude's in, like, the 9th grade, man.
Come on. Let's go. Get up.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.077
Come on. Go, go, go. Keep going. Hit him.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.123
Eighth grade.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.554
-Let's go.
-Here. Right here. Force him left.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.098
Force him left.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.561
Lock him down.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.864
Finish the game strong.
Make the right play. Let's go.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.742
Let's go, boy. Let's go.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.413
Come on. Hold it for the last shot.
Hold it for the last shot.

08:18.748 --> 08:23.377
Okay, T. You got 12, 11, ten, nine--

08:23.461 --> 08:25.713
Hold it. Hold it.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.841
Now, go. Five. Four--

08:34.096 --> 08:38.476
Finish that shit yourself.
Take the fucking shot. Goddamn it.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.229
You made the right play, Terron.
-Thanks, coach.

08:43.189 --> 08:46.400
Forget about the L, baby.
Look at this. We bigtime.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.819
Fifty thousand views, huh?
Give it up.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.364
Go shake them up.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.618
Hey, good game.
Good game, guys. Good game.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.370
Good game, guys. Good game.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.207
There it is. All right.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.377
You a point guard.
But you ain't always gonna be up top.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.965
You ended up on big dog, earlier.
What was that move you came with?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.343
Did I feel something?
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.931
Did somebody leave a window open?
I think I felt a breeze. Oh, no.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.685
That was my son trying to bring
that weak-ass stuff. Come on, baby.

09:20.768 --> 09:24.939
Can't try to breeze through the lane.
I need you to be a hurricane. Get low.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.193
That's what I'm talking about, boy. Mm.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.446
Yo, you good?

09:33.948 --> 09:36.909
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. You know me.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.790
I'm gonna get that weak shit out of here.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.376
Better stop that mess.

09:50.506 --> 09:54.218
I like what I see out there, T.
You got that rock on a string, baby.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.386
This is Byron.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.138
He's been scouting us from, uh...

09:58.347 --> 10:00.349
-Um...
-Liberty Union Prep.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.518
-There it is.
-Program on the come-up.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.271
Yo, let's get moving.
You've seen enough?

10:05.354 --> 10:07.940
-Let's chop it up.
-Get showered up, son.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.867
That was crazy.
That was a great game.

10:17.950 --> 10:22.121
That was crazy. He got right in
the coach's face, that was crazy.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.208
This ain't about you,
this is about Riverside.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.003
There are other options for him.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.296
What, private?

10:30.671 --> 10:33.215
He won't be as good at anything
as he could be at this game.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.636
He is too smart for you to say
what he could and couldn't be.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
<i>We have 500,000 high school players.</i>

10:45.019 --> 10:47.563
<i>A hundred and fifty thousand are seniors.</i>

10:49.231 --> 10:51.776
<i>We have 18,000 college players.</i>

10:55.446 --> 10:57.990
<i>Four thousand of whom are on scholarship.</i>

11:00.826 --> 11:03.412
<i>Sixty NBA draft picks.</i>

11:03.496 --> 11:05.206
Hey. Having fun?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.583
<i>Thirty in the first round.</i>

11:09.043 --> 11:11.462
<i>We have 500,000 high school players.</i>

11:13.214 --> 11:15.091
Oh, you recorded your class.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.719
Wow, look at you.
That's good, Terron. That's clever.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.096
<i>150,000 are seniors.</i>

11:20.179 --> 11:23.057
Are the math rods helping you
comprehend the numbers?

11:23.516 --> 11:27.061
-Still ain't making no sense.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.398
-Come on.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.274
You can do this. You got it.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.783
I ain't talking about walk-around money.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.327
It's gonna cost
to get his ass back and forth.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.456
Yeah. Get back to me with something.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.125
All right.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.339
No.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.634
That ain't gonna be a problem
no more. Your pops is on it.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.804
You just gotta keep putting in work,
all right?

12:01.887 --> 12:03.389
-All right.
-All right. Let's go.

You look taller in the videos.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.180
Who are you?

12:44.763 --> 12:46.348
Coach Gaines. Liberty Prep.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.351
Your dad said I might find you here.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.483
Your team is 0 and 6 this season, huh?

12:56.358 --> 12:59.028
That must be frustrating,
as good as you are.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.446
Yeah, it sucks. We're trash.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.160
If you were at Liberty,
you'd be 10 and 1.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.246
Play twice as many games
with better teammates, better facilities.

13:09.330 --> 13:13.042
You'd get to travel around the country.
You ever been to California?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.544
I never been out the state.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.924
What?

13:20.925 --> 13:25.137
I would have to leave my mom,
my pops, my friends. Everything.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.353
I wanna show you something.

13:34.563 --> 13:35.731
You recognize him?

13:36.857 --> 13:39.693
Yeah, he's nice.
You used to coach him or something?

13:39.777 --> 13:43.030
Yeah. In fact,
I met him on a court just like this one.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.242
He didn't wanna leave home.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.120
But he made the sacrifices he needed to
and now he's an NBA all-star.

13:54.124 --> 13:57.670
No.
He listened to every fucking thing I said.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.589
Talent's not enough.
You need someone in your corner

14:00.673 --> 14:03.259
who knows the system
and how to play it for you.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.178
He figured that out
and he has 100 million.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.556
What would you do
with that money, Terron?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.642
I would buy my parents a house.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.104
One of those pools that's, like,
shaped like a bean.

14:16.313 --> 14:20.234
What are those things in the backyard
where you just like eat and fart?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.321
-Yeah, a gazebo.

14:29.034 --> 14:33.080
It's real nice you wanna take care
of your family, Terron. It is.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.793
We both know that's not gonna happen
if you stay here.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.006
Think about it.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.638
Wait, coach.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.560
I wanna make it just like him.
I wanna take care of my family.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.981
Good.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.860
Start by giving me 50
behind that crack right there.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.613
All right.
Um, could you count them for me?

15:06.196 --> 15:07.406
You got it. Let's go.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.909
That's one.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.493
There you go. Nice.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.915
Two.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.668
So, what's the gym like?
-Oh, the gym's real nice.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.629
-You're gonna like it.
-Can't wait.

15:22.504 --> 15:26.133
I wanna play basketball forever, coach.
Till I'm, like, your age.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.429
That's cold.
My bad for being late.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.351
I worked him out pretty hard.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.561
-Nice to meet you, Vince.

15:40.397 --> 15:44.360
See? I told you those highlights
would get the word out. Hmm?

15:45.110 --> 15:48.155
Byron and I talked broad strokes,
but we have details to hammer out.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.449
Sounds good. Byron's right.
You're tall.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.868
-And a half.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.412
Three sports.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.332
Yeah, I was all about football.
Wideout.

15:58.415 --> 16:02.378
Well, tight end after I hit my spurt.
I was shorter than him at his age.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.048
Man, he's gonna be tall.
His mama's tall, too.

16:06.674 --> 16:10.761
-That's good. I can't wait to meet her.

16:10.844 --> 16:14.264
-Ma won't let me go.
-Don't worry. She's not my first mom.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.308
You ain't her first coach.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.688
All we need is a good game plan.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.857
I can set you up,
but you have to knock it down.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.695
Because the only person
she can't say no to... is you.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.782
You got this?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.870
We're offering your son
a full-ride scholarship,

16:36.954 --> 16:38.414
including room and board.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.083
Liberty's never offered this
to someone so young.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.585
That's how much we believe
in his potential.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.213
Your school is called Liberty?
This says it's--

16:46.296 --> 16:50.259
Liberty Prep is connected to Bishop
Anthony, an elite country day school

16:50.342 --> 16:53.262
that sends its students
to the finest universities.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.139
They prepare him academically,

16:55.222 --> 16:57.391
we prepare for the next level
athletically.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.601
It really is the best of both worlds.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.355
So, Liberty is a high school team.
But Terron is only 14.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.982
He's already playing up.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.151
He's gonna live with older students?

17:07.234 --> 17:09.153
He'll live and train
with the team.

17:09.236 --> 17:12.156
But he'll study with students his own age
at Bishop Anthony.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.117
How far away is this school?
-Just over the state line.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.913
Thanks for the offer.
We'll discuss it as a family.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.625
I understand.
Unfortunately, there is a timing element.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.294
I'm on my way to a tournament

17:25.377 --> 17:27.963
and a player is ready to accept
the roster spot.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
Nia, we cannot pass this up.

17:31.508 --> 17:36.221
Is there anything I can do to help you
feel more comfortable with this decision?

17:39.725 --> 17:44.063
If Terron goes to your school, he'd be
one of the smartest kids on your team...

17:45.397 --> 17:52.071
but he also has a condition, dyscalculia,
which is a kind of number blindness.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.363
He told me about it.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.700
He did?

17:58.243 --> 18:00.537
Ma, you think things are getting better?

18:01.663 --> 18:04.416
They will get better.
We need to work harder.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.876
You think I ain't trying?

18:07.377 --> 18:10.506
It's like a-- Like another language.
I feel so stupid.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.801
But what else can we do
we ain't been doing?

18:14.843 --> 18:19.014
I mean, like, at his school,
they have learning specialists, tutors.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.059
They even got a whole, um--
What is it called?

18:22.142 --> 18:26.188
-Learning Differences curriculum.
-Ma, they have a whole program for me.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.524
Please, just let me go get help.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.071
Is this what you really want, our boy?

18:37.324 --> 18:41.495
You have to promise me that this is
leading him towards a college education.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.499
I'll promise he'll receive multiple
scholarship offers without a doubt.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.001
You have to promise me you're gonna work

18:48.085 --> 18:50.504
just as hard off the court
as you will on it.

18:50.587 --> 18:51.713
I promise.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.768
Everybody follow me.
I'll follow you guys back.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.397
About to check out the new school.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.275
We doing this live, baby.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.153
Fresh meat.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.321
What's up?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.782
Coach Curtis. I'll get that for you.
Hop in.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.701
There it is.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.165
Wasn't that the school?

19:26.248 --> 19:29.251
That's Bishop Anthony.
That's where you take classes.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.253
Home is this way.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.312
Welcome to Liberty House.

20:08.332 --> 20:12.252
-Yeah, I know, it's a little rough,

20:12.336 --> 20:15.714
but remember, we're staying at nice hotels
most of the time.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.675
Why don't we just live in the school?

20:19.009 --> 20:22.512
Bishop Anthony is a day school,
so no one actually lives there.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.976
-We play for us.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.979
But it's good for them, too.
It's like a partnership.

20:31.063 --> 20:35.067
You know, they get some extra tuition,
make their diversity quota,

20:35.150 --> 20:37.945
and get some real ballers to cheer for.

20:38.028 --> 20:42.241
And we get our transcripts and visas
covered and get to use their facilities,

20:42.324 --> 20:44.576
which are nicer than some colleges.

20:45.827 --> 20:49.373
You'll see it tomorrow.
You're gonna love it. Trust me. This way.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.168
You just take that top bunk right there.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.593
You need anything at all,
holler at me downstairs.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.471
All right.
Um, do I have to set an alarm?

21:04.554 --> 21:08.600
-No, I'll get you up bright and early.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.478
First up is the optional-mandatory
workout.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.563
All right.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.326
Yo, turn it the fuck off.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.079
Good morning.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.419
Here you go, Terron. Good morning.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.051
Sup. My name's T.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.054
Yo, coach?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.513
Good morning, Anton.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.974
Got a daycare team
you ain't told us about?

22:31.975 --> 22:33.727
You somebody's son or something?

22:34.478 --> 22:35.479
Yeah. Ain't you?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.985
Yo, I figured it out.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.403
I know who you are.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.073
You're the ball boy.
Why didn't you say so?

22:46.907 --> 22:49.701
-Yeah.

22:51.578 --> 22:55.207
Yo, y'all met the new ball boy?
He's gonna be carrying your shit.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.071
More gifted, more responsibility,
gentlemen.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.617
Pain is just the weakness
leaving your body.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.120
Get down in the squat, fresh meat.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.667
Fresh meat here is working harder
than all y'all.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.086
Come on, get in there.

23:44.381 --> 23:48.510
Let's go. Pack it in. Hit the shower.
You got second period in 26 minutes.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.847
Petrus. Wrong direction.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.014
My bad, coach.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.016
Class is through there, fresh meat.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.702
What time is it?

24:15.871 --> 24:17.706
We are not going to first period. This was first period.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.548
So, then how am I gonna pass...
pre

24:27.507 --> 24:28.466
Do not worry.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.511
You are getting help.
You understand?

24:45.859 --> 24:47.277
Hey, did you see

24:47.360 --> 24:49.571
I'm only 70 percent sure
that I got--

24:49.779 --> 24:52.282
That I got--
The whole thing was--

24:58.496 --> 25:00.707
That test? Dude.
I didn't do the bonus question.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.417
You didn't get it?
I didn't get it, either, -but I tried my best.
Yeah.

25:04.211 --> 25:08.048
And everyone open to Psalms 32:34.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.138
<i>Where are you, Terron?</i>

25:15.222 --> 25:18.475
I'm supposed to be in class,
but I can't find any of them.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.436
<i>Well, why don't you ask someone for help,</i>
<i>baby?</i>

25:21.519 --> 25:23.063
I don't know anybody.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.566
<i>You've gotta make new friends.</i>
<i>You might as well start now.</i>

25:26.650 --> 25:27.859
Yeah.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.486
-Ball boy.
-Yo, Petrus.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.613
Ma, let me call you back.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.491
I need your help finding my classes.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.786
Your next class, second floor,

25:38.578 --> 25:41.164
but you don't need to take
this one or that one.

25:42.457 --> 25:44.876
I'm missing one class
because of the workout.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.213
If we take test online
or if we turn in paper,

25:48.296 --> 25:49.798
the team gets help to pass.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.675
Hmm.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.678
We're all in the
Learning Differences curriculum.

25:54.761 --> 25:55.595
What?

25:55.887 --> 25:57.222
Oh.

25:57.305 --> 26:01.351
The Learning Differences curriculum.
You don't go to class all the time.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.312
You have practices, workouts,
games, travel.

26:04.396 --> 26:08.900
We cannot go. Coach, he makes sure
we stay eligible for college.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.485
So, we don't have to worry?

26:11.486 --> 26:14.197
We're too big to fail.
Come. Lose to me in <i>2K.</i>

26:15.699 --> 26:16.574
Yeah, all right.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.870
But you going down. Watch.

26:20.954 --> 26:24.749
Dude. I'm gonna destroy you.
You wanna bet 5 bucks?

26:24.833 --> 26:26.918
What?
-I'm gonna kill you.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.753
I'm taking your money.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.927
Fresh meat.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.096
-Oh, nice.
These your size?

26:39.347 --> 26:40.557
No, these are my size.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.648
Yo, coach. Am I starting tonight?

26:49.232 --> 26:51.276
You're gonna be starting, little man.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.947
Minute after never.
In the month of Nevuary.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.782
Nevuary 32nd.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.411
-Um...

27:01.828 --> 27:02.662
One?

27:03.705 --> 27:04.831
Yo.

27:17.010 --> 27:21.056
Ref, that's more than three seconds.
He's living in that paint. Call that.

27:21.639 --> 27:24.476
Forty. Forty. There you go.
Pass it. Pass it.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.186
Fuck. Time

27:31.649 --> 27:34.110
I was open.

27:34.194 --> 27:37.447
-I'm a three-point shooter.
-You're not a three-point maker.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.991
Why do they call me "Microwave"?
I get hot.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.160
They call you Microwave
because you give me cancer.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.746
Now, have a seat.
Come on, Forte. You're in.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.289
Show us what you got.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.794
Coach, how much time is left?

27:51.753 --> 27:53.213
Two fifty-eight. Let's go.

27:54.339 --> 27:58.134
He's not tall, but at least he got
special needs. Good pickup, coach.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.703
Terron. You're not in the bush league.
Head up. See the floor.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.499
Screen, screen.
All right, do it, Terron.

28:36.089 --> 28:38.258
You can't switch there. Time-out.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.766
<i>There's a whole new level</i>
<i>of competition here, Terron.</i>

28:46.850 --> 28:48.977
Everyone's seen that eurostep before.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.230
Get used to guys
meeting you above the rim.

28:52.313 --> 28:55.692
Come in like you did in the game.
All right? Now, hold up.

28:56.484 --> 29:00.822
See? You give the defender an easy block.
But, you pro-hop to the other side,

29:00.905 --> 29:03.158
use the rim as protection,
finish with the reverse.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.833
Good. All right. Now speed it up
and cover more ground.

29:16.337 --> 29:17.172
There you go.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.967
All right, listen. Daddy's gotta go.
I love you. Okay?

29:21.050 --> 29:23.219
All right, I miss you, too. Good night.

29:23.303 --> 29:26.473
You know that move was called a travel
back when I played.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.476
Coach, you didn't have
the three-point line when you played.

29:29.559 --> 29:34.105
Sure as hell had one when I dropped seven
against Carolina in the '94 tournament.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.107
-YouTube that shit.

29:37.984 --> 29:38.860
You ever go pro?

29:39.444 --> 29:42.906
Not in the NBA. No speed, no size.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.741
Couldn't really play D for shit.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.243
Good enough to play
in Latvia for a while.

29:47.327 --> 29:51.122
-Exactly. That's what I said to my agent.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.041
But it was the only offer we got,

29:53.124 --> 29:56.503
so I kept playing, saw the world,
had a good run.

29:57.670 --> 30:01.090
-Sounds pretty fun to me. I'll play there.
-Yeah.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.635
Let's get out
before I get us both in trouble.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.261
In trouble for what?

30:05.345 --> 30:08.348
Rules say you can only practice
so many hours in a day.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.018
Can I keep playing?
I'm trying to get the move down.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.939
You're right. Fuck them.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.276
-Let's do the same thing, other side.
-All right.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.697
Here. Come on.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.494
Your family live in the house, coach?

30:29.577 --> 30:32.288
No, I'm crashing with the team
for a little while.

30:33.081 --> 30:37.252
You know, it's tough being a coach's wife,
especially when you have 12 boys.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.505
Damn. You be getting busy, coach.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.299
Oh, oh. You talking about us.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.886
Yeah. I'm talking about us.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.931
But in the off-season,
the roster's down to two girls.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.434
-Maybe you'll meet them.
What they look like

30:54.310 --> 30:55.603
Oh, come on, coach.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.208
Nice ringtone, nigga.
Your mother call you?

31:20.670 --> 31:22.213
Do not listen to these two:

31:22.297 --> 31:24.048
Uh...

31:25.717 --> 31:27.677
They are
What is your word?

31:27.760 --> 31:29.804
Uh... Douche bags.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.808
-I'm 18.

31:35.351 --> 31:39.147
-Cough up that birth certificate.
-Shut up your mouth. Idiot.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.524
Olembe, you were 6
when you were born, no?

31:41.608 --> 31:44.944
Hey, yo, special needs.
You almost had a trillion tonight.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.866
You know what that is?
One minute and ten zeros.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.370
Funny. Zero points, zero assists.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.456
Yo, you know how to read
a box score?

32:14.098 --> 32:16.059
Hey, yo, rook. Your job ain't done.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.102
Carry my shit. All season long.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.393
Bro, I will fuck you up, man.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
Why aren't you dressed?

33:01.729 --> 33:04.941
-This motherfucker took my bag.

33:05.024 --> 33:08.695
I don't know. I mean,
I saw one in the back of the van.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.364
It could've been his, coach.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.575
The van's in the back of the lot,
so hurry up, Anton.

33:19.288 --> 33:23.751
And starting at guard,
number zero, Terron Forte.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.634
-Take care of business. One, two, three.
Liberty.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.846
Hey. Just run motion. All right?

33:34.929 --> 33:36.514
Show me why I brought you here.

33:36.597 --> 33:37.682
Yes, coach.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.031
There we go.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.954
Nice of you to join us, Lyles.

34:10.506 --> 34:11.883
Never gonna start, huh?

34:20.058 --> 34:23.186
Go, go. Shoot it. Shoot. Shoot.
Terron--

34:31.652 --> 34:34.072
Don't let up. Let's go. Let's go.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.198
Forte.

34:36.074 --> 34:36.908
What's wrong?

34:37.950 --> 34:39.368
Is this that numbers thing?

34:41.412 --> 34:42.955
I can't read the shot clock.

34:44.248 --> 34:47.126
-We didn't have a stupid shot clock.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.963
Right. What about at the end of every
quarter

34:58.096 --> 35:02.934
Seven, six, five-- Go, go, go.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.398
Whoo!

35:12.443 --> 35:15.279
See that pass?
He's only 14 years old.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.076
Top of that rim, I'm telling you.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.035
Forte.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.455
-Yo.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.541
-Yeah, all right.
-You throw me ally,

35:26.624 --> 35:28.334
I put nuts on their face.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.461
Yeah, I got you.  Point guard.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.551
What's up, Byron?

35:42.932 --> 35:45.560
Good game, champ.
Yo, I got something for you.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.237
-Oh, snap.
-You getting upgraded, baby boy.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.240
-Yeah, word.

35:59.323 --> 36:02.577
Whatever you need,
you just holla at Uncle B.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.787
-All right.

36:05.621 --> 36:07.290
-Thanks, Byron.
-All right.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.518
<i>Forte.</i>

36:30.605 --> 36:33.399
-No doubt.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.985
Good. Then you need to learn
how to run plays.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.613
You need to know this offense
inside and out.

36:38.696 --> 36:39.989
So, I'm gonna be point?

36:40.072 --> 36:41.449
Slow down there, homeboy.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.576
I'm gonna keep you at the two
for now.

36:43.659 --> 36:46.662
Gonna have you back up Anton at the one.
He's more of a scoring guard,

36:46.746 --> 36:49.957
but he's a senior and he knows
the plays well. All right?

36:51.375 --> 36:55.838
You're my point guard of the future.
I'll get you up to speed on the playbook.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.549
Thirty-two.

36:58.633 --> 37:02.720
-We use numbers for our play calls.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.055
Hold up.
-Exactly.

37:04.138 --> 37:06.891
-Oh, no. I got it.

37:06.974 --> 37:10.144
First number is the play.
Second number is the direction.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.313
Odds to the left, evens to the right.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.690
-So, odds to the--
-Left.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.114
Look. Anton, call 47.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.075
-Forty-seven.

37:24.158 --> 37:26.535
Forty's the play.
And seven's the direction.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.455
If it was on the other side, it'd be 48.
You got it?

37:30.665 --> 37:33.209
Don't worry.
You'll pick it up quick. Coach?

37:37.338 --> 37:39.799
I want you to bury your nose
in this playbook

37:39.882 --> 37:42.260
like it's a pillow made out of
Rihanna's titties.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.553
Forty-eight.

37:46.138 --> 37:48.140
-I got you, coach.
-Now, watch this.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.487
<i>Y'all know why big man</i>
<i>can't hit no threes?</i>

38:01.570 --> 38:02.446
Why's that, man?

38:02.530 --> 38:04.615
Because he's nailing them all day
off the court.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.159
Stupid, man.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.454
Hey, yo.
I got a question for you, Einstein.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.960
It's the number of fucks I give.

38:16.544 --> 38:20.423
Bro, I'm being serious.
I wanna know what you're doing.

38:20.506 --> 38:23.426
What are these blocks for?
Maybe they could help me?

38:24.051 --> 38:28.097
Hey. Don't tell them, but...
I got a learning disability.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.183
Something that works for you
could work for me.

38:32.143 --> 38:36.856
Well, they just represent numbers.
This represents five, this represents ten.

38:36.939 --> 38:39.275
-Yeah.
-So, this is half of that.

38:39.358 --> 38:41.277
Oh. I see.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.779
You're trying to diagram plays.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.949
Dawg, I'm glad you're here.

38:47.700 --> 38:51.037
Yo, this nigga's gonna make me
look like a fucking genius.

38:58.085 --> 39:00.046
Hey, hey.
Double foul.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.297
Three black, one white.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.925
Use your heads. You can't foul out
in a situation like that.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.887
That's five on number one.
He's gone, coach.

39:07.970 --> 39:11.015
Anton, get your ass up.
Terron, you slide to the one.

39:12.099 --> 39:15.311
All right, listen up.
We're gonna hold for the last shot.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.813
We're gonna run 50.
Terron, it's a tie game.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.024
You be patient, make the read.

39:20.107 --> 39:22.526
Let's go. Finish on three.
One, two, three.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.111
Finish!
-Let's go. Come on.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.363
We got this.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.998
Twelve, eleven, ten--

39:36.082 --> 39:37.375
Fifty-five. Fifty-five.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.681
-Yeah, I--

39:52.765 --> 39:55.226
-You was supposed to--

39:55.309 --> 39:57.728
You go left.
Odds go left, you fucking idiot.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.737
Terron, what the hell was that?

40:06.821 --> 40:10.616
-I'm not used to plays with directions.
-Your problem's with numbers.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.702
No, it's, like, a visual thing.
Numbers are backwards.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.163
-Left is right sometimes--
-Listen to me.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.208
You wanna play,
know your left from your right, okay?

40:21.669 --> 40:22.586

40:37.393 --> 40:40.438

40:56.287 --> 40:57.455
How did you get here?

40:58.122 --> 41:01.459
-Game wasn't that far.

41:04.086 --> 41:06.464
Where's Dad

41:07.465 --> 41:11.093
He's at work. He's doing fine.
Don't worry about him.

41:11.802 --> 41:15.222
So, tell me how your new friends are,
how your new classes are.

41:18.684 --> 41:19.685
What's wrong?

41:28.319 --> 41:30.905
-Wish I could do it like everyone else.
-Ooh. I know.

41:31.739 --> 41:36.243
Have two teammates run to either side,
yell out which side they're standing on,

41:36.327 --> 41:39.079
and call their names
as the direction of the play.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.123
Ma, that's just crazy.

41:44.126 --> 41:48.380
Okay, you're right. It's a bad idea.
We just have to get creative.

41:48.464 --> 41:51.675
I know what numbers are even
and which are odd, it's just--

41:51.759 --> 41:53.719
I don't know what side to go on.

41:53.802 --> 41:56.347
Well, you shoot with your right hand,
right?

41:56.430 --> 41:59.141
Well, yeah, but--
I don't gotta think about that.

41:59.683 --> 42:02.019
What happens when you shoot
with your left?

42:02.269 --> 42:04.021
I don't think about that either.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.781
Let's go. Execute on three.
One, two, three.

42:13.864 --> 42:14.949
Execute.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.243
Coach. Let me run it. I got this.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.041
-Lyles, you swing to the two.

42:24.124 --> 42:24.959
You heard me.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.503
Hand him the keys?
He's driving the short bus.

42:33.008 --> 42:33.884
Thirty.

42:46.021 --> 42:47.439
Thirty-nine. Thirty-nine.

43:02.871 --> 43:06.125
Great throw. Great throw.
That's how you throw a fucking pass.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.002
There you go.

43:08.794 --> 43:12.256
We're gonna run 50.
Lyles, on the wing. Petrus, on the left--

43:12.339 --> 43:14.300
-Coach, run 40.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.302
His man is fronting.
He's gonna get the screen.

43:16.385 --> 43:19.805
-Give a man a rope, he wanna be a cowboy.
-I'll call the play for you.

43:19.888 --> 43:23.642
-Give me the ball at the top of the key.
-Both of you just shut up.

43:23.726 --> 43:24.727
Shut up, okay?

43:26.270 --> 43:27.980
Here's what we're gonna do.

43:28.772 --> 43:31.150
Get the ball to Forte
at the top of the key.

43:31.525 --> 43:32.359
Let's go.

43:53.422 --> 43:55.674
-That's what I'm talking about.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.926
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Yeah.

43:59.094 --> 44:02.097
-Yeah, of course, coach.

44:02.181 --> 44:05.517
Hey, Terron. Can we get a drop
for our website

44:06.644 --> 44:09.480
-No problem.
-Make sure you get Liberty in there.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.025
All right, coach. I got you.
Just say to the camera.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.610

Oh.

47:21.421 --> 47:22.798

47:28.136 --> 47:30.430

We've gone through this.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.830
That's bullshit.
-Not the first time we went through this.

47:54.913 --> 47:57.958
-I've done this with everyone--
I'm handing you cash.

47:58.041 --> 48:01.378
It says clearly you gotta pay
the full amount or you're out.

48:01.461 --> 48:04.881
I don't give a fuck. You don't
post more notices on that door.

48:05.549 --> 48:08.260
And you come to me, man-to-man.
Take your money.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.521
Mom. What's going on?

48:19.605 --> 48:21.064
Why was he in my room?

48:22.149 --> 48:24.484
We miss having you around.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.112
But we're gonna work everything out.

48:28.614 --> 48:32.284
Wait. Are we gonna have to move
because he lost his job again?

48:33.076 --> 48:34.995
No, he's gonna find something else.

48:36.038 --> 48:38.415
I mean, he could try to get some help.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.462
Now, you know
he won't see anybody about it.

48:48.925 --> 48:49.885
Come on.

48:56.391 --> 48:57.476
Where you been?

48:59.311 --> 49:00.896
I been in the weight room.

49:01.730 --> 49:03.482
How your old man look, boy?

49:03.565 --> 49:05.817
-Yoked up.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.153
Yeah, I still got something left.

49:08.695 --> 49:11.782
Yeah. Me and Ma,
we was just talking about that.

49:12.866 --> 49:14.117
Talking about what?

49:15.243 --> 49:17.079
What playing football did to you.

49:19.831 --> 49:21.083
Yeah, what'd she say?

49:22.000 --> 49:25.671
She said--
She said you should go see a doctor.

49:27.422 --> 49:29.716
She don't know what she's talking about.

49:31.468 --> 49:34.388
Playing the way you did,
like, getting concussions--

49:34.471 --> 49:37.224
Ain't nothing, T. You hear me?

49:38.308 --> 49:40.519
-The other things--
-It ain't the same.

49:46.024 --> 49:50.237
Can't do nothing about it.
Neither can you, or any doctor.

49:51.321 --> 49:54.825
-I'm sorr-- I--
Then what?

49:54.908 --> 49:55.826
Ain't no check.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.787
Ain't no reparations for this.

49:58.870 --> 50:01.540
These fucking headaches,
this useless memory.

50:01.623 --> 50:02.958
Now, you listen to me.

50:03.041 --> 50:06.503
Because I learned something from
all these years at JuCo.

50:06.586 --> 50:08.630
And the middle school, high school,

50:08.714 --> 50:11.425
I learned that these coaches,
these agents,

50:11.508 --> 50:15.053
these motherfuckers wearing those suits,
they are gonna use you.

50:16.847 --> 50:20.016
So, we have got to figure out
how to use them to get ours.

50:21.601 --> 50:22.602
You hear me?

50:43.665 --> 50:45.375
The kid's better in person.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.629
Uh

50:49.713 --> 50:52.174
I don't care how many views
his mixtape has.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.927
He came into my office.
I gotta get off the phone.

50:59.097 --> 51:02.809
Hey, Terron. What's up?
What brings you to the presidential suite?

51:05.061 --> 51:07.481
Can you hire another assistant coach?

51:08.857 --> 51:09.858
Why?

51:10.817 --> 51:13.111
Well, my dad, he needs a job.

51:15.030 --> 51:19.034
Well, look. I don't have
the budget for that. I wish I did.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.370
Well, we got a sponsor now.
Doesn't that help?

51:22.454 --> 51:25.081
It helps, but they're just
supplying us product.

51:25.165 --> 51:28.919
We don't have their deal.
Hell, he's got four paid assistants.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.422
-Victory Country Day.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.549
One of the top-ranked teams in the nation.

51:34.633 --> 51:35.926
What, are we playing them next?

51:36.760 --> 51:40.138
If we're lucky we play them
in the finals of the invitational.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.557
Know what I could do with four assistants?

51:42.641 --> 51:43.767
Hire my pops?

51:45.811 --> 51:47.562
He's the reason I'm here, coach.

51:52.734 --> 51:53.610
Hold on.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.572
You really want him here, huh?

52:00.909 --> 52:03.036
You been using that move
I showed you?

52:03.119 --> 52:05.330
-All of them.

52:07.082 --> 52:10.252
So, uh, what
What do you got in mind for me, coach?

52:10.335 --> 52:12.087
We'll have you work with Byron.

52:12.170 --> 52:15.340
Help surround Terron
with the right players for next year.

52:15.423 --> 52:17.050
He is the future of this team.

52:17.843 --> 52:21.346
Indeed, so you, uh--
You want me to Uncle up. Got you.

52:21.429 --> 52:24.933
-Exactly.

52:25.016 --> 52:26.977
Have to be on the road a lot. Okay?

52:27.060 --> 52:29.521
I'll do whatever it takes.
Great.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.940
Shake hands,
find out who's not happy.

52:32.524 --> 52:34.943
That sounds great.

52:35.026 --> 52:38.363
Good. Glad to have you onboard, Vince.
I know Terron is, too.

52:38.446 --> 52:42.701
-Byron can handle all that.

52:42.784 --> 52:43.743
Thank you.

52:48.164 --> 52:50.375
I'll tell you something.
We sucked tonight,

52:50.458 --> 52:53.920
but you guys sucked, too.
Both of you. Tell your buddy that.

52:54.004 --> 52:55.088
Listen up.

52:56.339 --> 53:00.176
Listen. You guys like your new sneakers,
new uniforms, all that?

53:00.260 --> 53:02.387
Yeah? Good. You can kiss it goodbye

53:02.470 --> 53:05.807
if you let a bunch of scrubs
hang with us. 15 seconds left.

53:05.891 --> 53:08.310
Let's finish them off.
And we're running 60.

53:08.393 --> 53:12.564
Terron, if we get the mismatch,
hit Petrus down in the post, all right?

53:12.647 --> 53:14.190
Yes, coach.
Go.

53:14.274 --> 53:16.401
-Come on. Win on three. One, two, three.
Win.

53:16.484 --> 53:17.319
Go.

53:18.069 --> 53:21.740
Look, I'm just saying, it shouldn't even
come down to this. It's bullshit.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.580
Sixty-three. Sixty-three.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.551
Let's go, boy! Let's get it!

53:41.968 --> 53:43.094
Yeah!

53:46.181 --> 53:48.183
Good passing.
That's what I'm talking about.

53:48.266 --> 53:50.143
Dumped on him, like boom!

53:50.226 --> 53:54.105
Listen to him. Good game, fellas.
T, let me holla at you.

53:55.106 --> 53:56.733
Let me holla at you.
Good game.

53:56.900 --> 53:59.945
Good game, but, uh...
why didn't you take that last shot?

54:00.612 --> 54:02.405
We won.
-No, listen.

54:02.489 --> 54:05.492
We are here to show people you can
show out when the spotlight's on.

54:06.076 --> 54:07.577
That's all them scouts see.

54:08.328 --> 54:09.371
You understand?

54:10.372 --> 54:11.373
You hear me?

54:13.333 --> 54:15.460
-Good game. Shower up.
-Okay.

54:17.128 --> 54:21.800
"The university has shown sincere interest
in you as a prospective student-athlete.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.428
We are informing you of our desire
to recruit you

54:25.512 --> 54:27.305
to our prestigious university."

54:27.806 --> 54:30.392
You know what that means?

54:30.475 --> 54:34.062
You are now an official prospect
in the eyes of the NCAA.

54:34.145 --> 54:36.564
And you're in the damn eighth grade,
my man.

54:40.610 --> 54:42.278
-They want me to visit.
-Mm-hm.

54:42.362 --> 54:44.447
-Hell, no.

54:44.531 --> 54:47.534
You're not going to some mid-major.
You kidding me?

54:48.118 --> 54:50.829
Listen, Terron, for the next five years,

54:50.912 --> 54:53.373
schools are gonna be sending you letters

54:53.456 --> 54:58.086
trying to spray and pray, but I wanna
get you offers from the blue bloods.

54:58.169 --> 55:01.214
-I wanna win the chip.

55:01.297 --> 55:03.383
Good. Then tune out all that noise.

55:03.466 --> 55:07.554
Don't listen to these schools. They
don't have your best interest at heart.

55:07.637 --> 55:10.306
In fact, don't listen
to anyone else about this.

55:10.390 --> 55:12.642
Not anyone,
you understand what I'm saying?

55:15.645 --> 55:16.479
You sure?

55:18.189 --> 55:20.066
Yeah, I got-- I'm with you, coach.

55:21.651 --> 55:24.029
Good. That's why it's important
that I alone

55:24.112 --> 55:26.990
handle the recruiting process
from here on out. Okay?

55:27.824 --> 55:30.493
Cool. Um, can I keep my first letter?

55:31.453 --> 55:32.287
Sure.

55:52.557 --> 55:54.434
You know they were recruiting you?

55:54.517 --> 55:57.062
Yeah, I knew.
Bro, this close to Signing Day,

55:57.145 --> 56:00.482
do you think I wouldn't know
who was offering me a scholarship?

56:01.608 --> 56:03.193
I was just trying to help.

56:06.196 --> 56:07.155
Hey, yo.

56:08.198 --> 56:09.783
T, look--

56:13.912 --> 56:18.541
Yo, for all that shit
that I been talking...  my bad.

56:19.375 --> 56:21.544
For real.
I was just hot because coach--

56:22.337 --> 56:24.881
He kicked out my homey
to make room for you.

56:24.964 --> 56:28.635
He said there was a open spot.
-They call it "overbooking."

56:28.718 --> 56:30.428
Not enough seats on the flight.

56:31.679 --> 56:35.058
-I'm a scorer, bro.

56:35.475 --> 56:37.852
-My averages are up with you feeding me.

56:38.269 --> 56:41.564
All right. Hey, yo.
Why didn't coach show you those?

56:42.148 --> 56:44.859
He don't want me to go to State.
He wants me to go to Tech.

56:45.151 --> 56:47.362
-I'll go to State.

56:47.445 --> 56:50.907
It's a better school. I'm tired of
wearing blue. I look better in red.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.827
Yo, good looking out.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.539
Wow.
I'm really excited to be here, you know. This has always been a dream of mine.

57:00.583 --> 57:02.794
I'd like to thank my coach
and teammates,

57:02.877 --> 57:05.421
because without them,
I wouldn't be here today.

57:05.964 --> 57:10.927
But I'm excited to say that in the fall,
I will be attending...

57:13.847 --> 57:14.722
Tech.

57:27.902 --> 57:30.071
What happened to looking better in red?

57:30.697 --> 57:33.700
Changed my mind.
Get more playing time over at Tech.

57:34.617 --> 57:35.994
Coach was pretty into it.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.997
Man, he the main one
who wanted me to go to State.

57:39.664 --> 57:42.917
Then we get a sponsor
and he talking about Tech, Tech, Tech.

57:43.001 --> 57:44.127
Why?

57:44.794 --> 57:45.837
Pfft.

57:46.921 --> 57:50.425
Bro, they ain't sponsoring us
so we can wear a logo right now.

57:51.259 --> 57:54.888
They want coach to steer us to colleges
that are on-brand.

57:54.971 --> 57:58.308
That way we on TV repping them
during March Madness, you dig?

57:58.933 --> 58:02.645
Hey, come on, man. Push, push.
What you think they paying coach for?

58:02.729 --> 58:05.648
I don't know.
He said they was giving him product.

58:06.608 --> 58:09.486
He's not gonna be your coach no more,
so why didn't you go to the better school

58:09.569 --> 58:12.238
-I got you.

58:14.866 --> 58:17.327
Look, we don't play for coach.

58:17.410 --> 58:20.121
We don't play for college,
don't play for the NBA,

58:20.205 --> 58:23.750
shit, we don't even play for the U.S.
We play for the brands.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.880
No, I'm serious. They the ones
that will pay us the most.

58:29.589 --> 58:30.507
All right?

58:31.007 --> 58:32.008
All right.

58:32.091 --> 58:32.926
All right.

58:33.468 --> 58:34.385
Thanks, bro.

58:45.146 --> 58:46.940
So, where your pops at?

58:47.482 --> 58:50.193
Yo, coach got him on the road,
scouting and stuff.

58:50.276 --> 58:52.570
-All right, y'all.

58:52.654 --> 58:55.198
Gotta hit these books.
We got finals coming up.

58:55.281 --> 58:58.785
But we have tournament coming up.
We need to get extra shots up.

58:58.868 --> 59:03.331
I need my eligibility, I really can't
risk it right now with my offer to Tech.

59:03.414 --> 59:05.333
I ain't been to class in a week.

59:05.416 --> 59:07.210
-All right, man.
All right, bro.

59:10.171 --> 59:13.466
<i>You know, I have to ask, are these real?</i>

59:14.425 --> 59:16.719
<i>Did you really get a B on your math quiz?</i>

59:17.804 --> 59:19.389
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a B.

59:33.778 --> 59:38.491
And the sides that make up
and form the right angle

59:38.575 --> 59:40.243
are called legs.

59:42.704 --> 59:44.706
Can I change my class schedule?

59:44.789 --> 59:48.376
I can't do class and practice.
I can't do both at the same time.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.920
You're in classes
the NCAA says to take

59:51.004 --> 59:54.340
to qualify for a scholarship.
And I can't change that, sorry.

59:55.174 --> 59:59.429
You can't be missing any workouts
and practices right now, you understand?

59:59.512 --> 1:00:01.347
-Not one.
-Yeah.

1:00:02.348 --> 1:00:04.726
We got the invitational
in less than a week.

1:00:07.937 --> 1:00:09.939
Who are we playing
in the tournament?

1:00:10.023 --> 1:00:11.941
Number one team in the nation.

1:00:12.358 --> 1:00:13.860
Victory Country Day.

1:00:14.944 --> 1:00:15.862
Yeah, I know.

1:00:16.821 --> 1:00:19.824
They got a hell of a lot more talent
than us. They do.

1:00:20.783 --> 1:00:23.453
We're gonna have to outwork them.
Win every 50-50

1:00:23.536 --> 1:00:25.663
and we need to hit the floor hard.

1:00:25.747 --> 1:00:29.542
Let's go, come on.
I wanna see some hustle, on the whistle.

1:00:30.585 --> 1:00:33.129
On the whistle, let's go.
Get it. Get it.

1:00:33.212 --> 1:00:35.923
Hustle. Come on, now.
Fight for it. Fight for it.

1:00:36.007 --> 1:00:39.302
That's what I wanna see.
Let's go, Forte.

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:41.512
On the ball. Let's go. Get it.

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:48.269
Hold on, hold on. You all right, Terron?

1:00:48.353 --> 1:00:49.437
Come on. Come on.

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:51.230
Lem. Lem. Lem.

1:00:51.522 --> 1:00:52.815
Lem, calm down.

1:00:52.899 --> 1:00:54.233
Can you bend it?

1:00:54.817 --> 1:00:56.402
-I can't, man. I can't.
-Okay.

1:00:59.989 --> 1:01:03.201
No, this is his coach.
Well, I am his family here.

1:01:04.202 --> 1:01:05.244
I understand.

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:08.915
Coach, is he gonna be okay?

1:01:11.334 --> 1:01:12.669
He'll be okay.

1:01:33.523 --> 1:01:35.692
Well, damn, boy, your ass was out cold.

1:01:37.193 --> 1:01:38.027
Yeah, I know.

1:01:41.531 --> 1:01:43.074
What's all these bags for?

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:48.496
Well, this is how I got it figured,
so I know where everything is at.

1:01:49.205 --> 1:01:50.915
When did you start doing this?

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:55.128
I ain't got your mom around
to keep track of my shit so...

1:01:57.171 --> 1:01:58.297
Room service.

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:03.553
Good. You got 30 minutes to get in
that meeting room and finish your exam.

1:02:03.928 --> 1:02:06.723
We'll watch film on Victory
and go over the plan.

1:02:06.806 --> 1:02:10.518
Uh, I drew up some new plays for my son.
Nobody know his game like me.

1:02:10.601 --> 1:02:12.437
I'd love to talk to you about it.

1:02:13.396 --> 1:02:16.190
Let me think about it.
Hustle up, Terron. Let's go.

1:02:26.617 --> 1:02:30.955
If you got a travel exception and you're
taking an online equivalent, check it.

1:02:31.038 --> 1:02:34.333
If your class has a written test,
we have aides here.

1:02:34.417 --> 1:02:37.503
And if we don't have a key, I can help.

1:02:44.802 --> 1:02:46.971
Hey.
Who's got the key for pre

1:02:47.555 --> 1:02:48.848
A.J. has it next.

1:02:52.101 --> 1:02:53.269
This all I know.

1:02:57.023 --> 1:02:59.400
You only wrote your name.
-This all I know.

1:03:19.003 --> 1:03:21.714
It looked like that kid
was feeding them answers.

1:03:21.798 --> 1:03:23.800
Some kids need more tutoring
than others.

1:03:23.883 --> 1:03:26.886
You promised that he was gonna get
a college education.

1:03:26.969 --> 1:03:29.263
I promised he'd get
a college scholarship,

1:03:29.347 --> 1:03:31.933
and he's going to.
That is what this is about.

1:03:32.016 --> 1:03:34.685
It's about having a route
to a better opportunity

1:03:34.769 --> 1:03:36.604
than what we'd be able to afford.

1:03:36.687 --> 1:03:39.190
Of course.
Think college will be different?

1:03:39.273 --> 1:03:41.442
Terron's gonna have 60 hours a week
of athletic commitments.

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:44.111
They'll push him to no-show classes
and if he keeps growing,

1:03:44.195 --> 1:03:46.280
he won't even be an upperclassman.

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:48.324
If he gets a scholarship,
he'll get a degree.

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:51.202
Don't even try to tell me
that that's not valuable.

1:03:51.285 --> 1:03:53.621
If your son is the player I believe he is,

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:56.999
he's gonna be making millions of dollars
while he's a teenager.

1:03:57.083 --> 1:04:00.962
Now, I'm sorry, but to me, that's
more valuable than a piece of paper.

1:04:01.546 --> 1:04:02.588
That's not right.

1:04:03.214 --> 1:04:07.552
What's not right is he's the reason this
exists and he can't be paid one dollar.

1:04:09.470 --> 1:04:12.431
TV rights go for billions
on the back of the players.

1:04:12.515 --> 1:04:16.269
The money he brings in allows for
trust-fund babies to play lacrosse,

1:04:16.352 --> 1:04:18.062
but he can't see a dime of it?

1:04:18.479 --> 1:04:21.732
Okay, Terron,
the part that he's leaving out,

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:26.612
is what if you don't make it
What do you think he's gonna do?

1:04:26.696 --> 1:04:29.115
He's just gonna move on to the next one.

1:04:30.992 --> 1:04:32.410
LeBron, Kobe.

1:04:33.536 --> 1:04:35.204
They all focused on one thing.

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:37.582
So did your father.

1:05:10.323 --> 1:05:11.324
Dang.

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:19.248
Wow.

1:05:26.422 --> 1:05:28.341
Oh, snap. Yo, I know you.

1:05:28.424 --> 1:05:29.675
-Hey.

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:31.677
Yeah, yeah. I'll take a pic.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:34.680
-Make me look good in it.
-Got you.

1:05:35.765 --> 1:05:39.393
-I play for the same coach you played for.

1:05:39.477 --> 1:05:41.771
-Gaines.

1:05:42.563 --> 1:05:45.107
Oh, Coach Gaines.
Yeah, you know what?

1:05:45.191 --> 1:05:48.611
He knows the game.
I only played with him for a little bit.

1:05:48.694 --> 1:05:50.446
-Yeah. One season.

1:05:50.529 --> 1:05:54.158
-Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
-Yeah, I understand.

1:05:54.533 --> 1:05:57.536
I am so glad you're in town for this.
You need tickets?

1:05:58.871 --> 1:06:01.540
I'm doing great, man.

1:06:01.624 --> 1:06:03.000
Hey. Put one of these on.

1:06:03.084 --> 1:06:04.710
-For old times' sake.
Come on.

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:07.463
-Come on. You know I keep one.
See? Team spirit.

1:06:07.546 --> 1:06:08.798
That's nice.

1:06:08.881 --> 1:06:10.383
I'll see you out there.

1:06:12.718 --> 1:06:16.097
Terron Forte, the eighth-grader.
Love your motor, young fella.

1:06:16.180 --> 1:06:17.932
-On video.

1:06:18.015 --> 1:06:19.642
-Looking forward to it in person.
Coach.

1:06:19.725 --> 1:06:21.268
-Hey, Vince.
-Hey.

1:06:21.352 --> 1:06:24.689
You got the mixtape. See the real thing.
His game is serious.

1:06:24.772 --> 1:06:26.774
That's what I hear.
Good luck.

1:06:38.661 --> 1:06:40.621
-Loose ball.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:06:41.330 --> 1:06:42.665
-Loose ball.
-Go, go, go.

1:06:43.249 --> 1:06:44.458
Yes. Yes.

1:06:58.347 --> 1:06:59.557
Yeah!

1:07:00.016 --> 1:07:02.309
Yeah! Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1:07:08.733 --> 1:07:09.984
Huddle up. Huddle up.

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:11.694
-I'm good, coach.

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:14.572
Bro, bro. We up by one.

1:07:14.697 --> 1:07:17.950
Listen up. We got 11 seconds left,
they got no timeouts.

1:07:18.034 --> 1:07:21.162
We don't have any fouls left to give.
One thing we know.

1:07:21.245 --> 1:07:23.372
Whoever gets that ball
ain't giving it up.

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:26.125
Double-team and force them
into a contested shot.

1:07:26.208 --> 1:07:29.003
-Go. Defense, on three. One, two, three.
Defense.

1:07:33.090 --> 1:07:34.800
I got him, I got him.

1:07:46.062 --> 1:07:47.438
Fuck, man.

1:07:51.609 --> 1:07:54.070
Who in their right mind
would wanna do this?

1:07:54.445 --> 1:07:56.238
I hate this job sometimes.

1:07:56.739 --> 1:07:59.033
At least we can play
in the consolation bracket.

1:07:59.116 --> 1:08:01.327
That's true. Hey, you know what?

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:03.829
Watching you out there
makes it all worth it.

1:08:03.913 --> 1:08:06.624
-Thanks, coach.
Way to keep it close, Jimmy.

1:08:06.707 --> 1:08:10.336
-Terron, you are better in person.
-Stay away from my player, Rob.

1:08:10.419 --> 1:08:12.630
Talk to mine.
I got no problem with that.

1:08:12.713 --> 1:08:16.383
-Just get in your van and get out of here.
We've got a bus.

1:08:17.384 --> 1:08:20.304
Hey, Vince.
There's a proud papa.

1:08:20.387 --> 1:08:21.472
We gotta talk.

1:08:21.555 --> 1:08:22.890
What was you thinking?

1:08:22.973 --> 1:08:25.768
-Stay the fuck away from my player!
-Easy, easy.

1:08:25.851 --> 1:08:27.978
-Easy.

1:08:28.479 --> 1:08:30.689
-Chill.
-Oh, fuck this.

1:08:32.108 --> 1:08:33.692
Should've won that game, man.

1:08:34.485 --> 1:08:36.362
-Shot was bullshit.

1:08:36.737 --> 1:08:38.322
That was the worst shot ever.

1:08:38.948 --> 1:08:40.116
I don't know, bro.

1:08:42.827 --> 1:08:43.702
I'll be back.

1:08:52.878 --> 1:08:56.507
Terron is nationally ranked
because of what I've done for him.

1:09:04.306 --> 1:09:06.809
I gave you a job.
This is how you repay me?

1:09:07.643 --> 1:09:09.895
You ain't using him right.
He's a scorer.

1:09:11.313 --> 1:09:13.774
You won't let him get his,
so I found somebody who will.

1:09:14.233 --> 1:09:16.527
What are you doing
meeting with him, Vince?

1:09:16.610 --> 1:09:20.614
When the number one team comes
calling, I listen to what they gotta say.

1:09:20.698 --> 1:09:24.118
Well, whatever that dirt bag
told you is bullshit. Trust me.

1:09:24.201 --> 1:09:25.995
He won't get any playing time.

1:09:26.078 --> 1:09:28.289
It's my son.
I ain't gotta listen to you.

1:09:28.372 --> 1:09:31.167
Actually, you do have to listen to me,
Vince.

1:09:31.250 --> 1:09:33.252
Do you realize how involved you are?

1:09:33.711 --> 1:09:35.296
The fuck are you talking about?

1:09:35.379 --> 1:09:38.257
Did you forget we paid you
to bring your son here
You basically sold him.

1:09:41.927 --> 1:09:43.971
You were the motherfucker
that paid me.

1:09:44.054 --> 1:09:45.389
No. Byron paid you.

1:09:45.472 --> 1:09:47.808
Money left his account,
ended up in yours.

1:09:47.892 --> 1:09:52.354
So, all your travel expenses, the receipts
for Terron's phone and his jewelry?

1:09:52.438 --> 1:09:55.858
You know what, Vince?
It's all improper benefits, all illegal.

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:58.152
You try to move your son
from my program,

1:09:58.235 --> 1:10:02.198
-I'll make sure Byron tells everything.

1:10:02.823 --> 1:10:08.495
You should, Vince. Once it's out he's been
paid to play, he's no longer an amateur.

1:10:09.788 --> 1:10:13.083
So, he's not going anywhere.
But you're done here.

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:17.379
You think after this, I'm gonna
keep him playing for your ass?

1:10:18.047 --> 1:10:20.132
Don't get in the way
of what we build.

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:34.897
<i> Hey, I'm in the stands.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:10:34.980 --> 1:10:38.567
I'm downstairs. I think
I just did something really stupid.

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:40.527
<i>-I'll be right there.</i>
-All right.

1:11:25.572 --> 1:11:26.532
Come on.

1:11:28.409 --> 1:11:32.371
-Let's go, son.

1:11:33.247 --> 1:11:36.208
-Go. Just go.

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:37.501
Boy, I will f--

1:11:45.759 --> 1:11:49.179
-I'm sorry that--

1:11:49.263 --> 1:11:50.931
No. No, I would never do that.

1:11:54.143 --> 1:11:56.520
-I heard everything.

1:11:58.897 --> 1:12:02.651
-I'm sorry. Let's forget this happened.
-We can't. I recorded it all.

1:12:03.193 --> 1:12:04.403
You recorded it?

1:12:06.196 --> 1:12:07.197
Well, delete it.

1:12:08.115 --> 1:12:10.868
I did. But it was live,
so it already got views.

1:12:12.953 --> 1:12:15.122
Jesus, Terron.
You shouldn't have done that.

1:12:15.205 --> 1:12:17.458
Recruiting violations
hurt the player most.

1:12:17.541 --> 1:12:19.460
If that gets out, that'd be bad.

1:12:19.918 --> 1:12:22.004
You could lose your eligibility to play.

1:12:22.963 --> 1:12:25.382
You'll be off the team
and I could be out of coaching.

1:12:26.759 --> 1:12:29.845
If anybody saved that,
you don't know how fucked we are.

1:12:33.390 --> 1:12:34.558
Oh, damn.

1:12:38.270 --> 1:12:39.938
Hey. What happened?

1:12:41.231 --> 1:12:42.191
I don't know.

1:12:53.077 --> 1:12:56.789
<i>Yeah, well, whatever that dirt bag</i>
<i>told you is bullshit, trust me.</i>

1:12:56.872 --> 1:13:00.084
<i>-He won't get playing time.</i>
<i>-I ain't gotta listen to you.</i>

1:13:00.167 --> 1:13:01.919
<i>You do have to listen to me, Vince.</i>

1:13:02.836 --> 1:13:04.505
<i>You realize how involved you are?</i>

1:13:04.588 --> 1:13:07.257
<i>Did you forget that we paid you money</i>
<i>to bring your son here?</i>

1:13:07.341 --> 1:13:08.550
<i>Did you forget that?</i>

1:13:08.634 --> 1:13:13.347
<i>Byron paid you. Money left his</i>
<i>bank account, ended up in yours.</i>

1:13:13.931 --> 1:13:16.683
<i>Scholarship wasn't enough?</i>
<i>You basically sold him.</i>

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:18.519
<i>You were the mother****** that paid me.</i>

1:13:18.602 --> 1:13:21.730
<i></i>
<i>-You should, Vince.</i>

1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:25.692
<i>Once it's out he's been paid to play,</i>
<i>he's no longer an amateur.</i>

1:13:32.783 --> 1:13:37.079
So, the idea with any equation
in algebra is the idea of equality.

1:13:37.538 --> 1:13:39.164
It's why it's called an equation.

1:13:39.248 --> 1:13:40.999
Whatever happens on one side
of the equal sign

1:13:41.083 --> 1:13:42.709
has to happen on the other.

1:14:20.747 --> 1:14:23.959
Well, I ain't on the court either,
so that makes two of us.

1:14:25.210 --> 1:14:27.588
Yo, bro. You gonna be all right?

1:14:28.297 --> 1:14:32.092
<i>They say yes,</i>
<i>but I have no health insurance.</i>

1:14:33.010 --> 1:14:36.513
<i>-Time to get job.</i>

1:14:36.597 --> 1:14:40.017
<i>I not gonna pretend I'm student no more.</i>
<i>I'm 24 years old.</i>

1:14:41.101 --> 1:14:43.812
Twenty I knew it.

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:51.153
<i>Hey. We no have no birth certificate,</i>
<i>so I say I'm 18 so I get student visa.</i>

1:14:52.154 --> 1:14:57.075
<i>-When I recover, I play international.</i>

1:14:59.536 --> 1:15:04.750
<i>To Latvia. I no know it,</i>
<i>but I ask coach, he found me team.</i>

1:15:05.667 --> 1:15:06.543
Hmm.

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:09.963
<i>So, what about you, Terron?</i>
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

1:15:24.811 --> 1:15:27.147
-Bills.

1:15:28.607 --> 1:15:29.441
Give them here.

1:15:30.359 --> 1:15:31.652
Boy, stop playing.

1:15:32.611 --> 1:15:35.614
What you gonna do?
You can't even pay them right now.

1:15:36.782 --> 1:15:38.158
You gonna sell me again?

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:48.168
Never even got a dollar for playing.

1:15:49.795 --> 1:15:50.963
Even for all of this.

1:15:55.509 --> 1:15:57.886
That's why I did what I did, boy.

1:15:59.137 --> 1:16:01.306
Just trying to take care of this family.

1:16:04.810 --> 1:16:05.936
You understand?

1:16:26.707 --> 1:16:29.084
So, Ma. How much this cost?

1:16:30.419 --> 1:16:32.254
-The house.

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:36.216
Well, that's not something
for you to worry about.

1:16:36.300 --> 1:16:38.594
I'm trying to work something out.
Come on.

1:16:40.929 --> 1:16:42.764
Ma, it's a math problem. Come on.

1:16:45.058 --> 1:16:47.603
How much should I put in
for my college amount?

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:49.896
Well, you could still go on scholarship.

1:16:50.897 --> 1:16:54.776
Yeah, I just put in the same
as your loans, but what about Dad?

1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:55.861
What about him?

1:16:56.445 --> 1:16:59.197
Prescriptions and stuff.
How much do they cost?

1:16:59.281 --> 1:17:02.367
Well, that depends on
if you have insurance--

1:17:02.909 --> 1:17:03.994
Yeah, true.

1:17:05.912 --> 1:17:06.955
But we don't.

1:17:07.289 --> 1:17:09.916
So, we need money for that,
on top of all this.

1:17:23.930 --> 1:17:27.643
I don't know, Ma.
It's not making any sense.

1:17:27.726 --> 1:17:30.062
Like, the numbers aren't making any sense.

1:17:31.146 --> 1:17:34.691
Well, why did you record that class
on your phone?

1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:38.028
How'd you get the direction
of your play calls right?

1:17:39.279 --> 1:17:42.658
I don't know. I guess I just find a way
to work around things.

1:17:44.242 --> 1:17:47.245
Well, what can we use
to work around these things?

1:17:47.746 --> 1:17:48.955
College.

1:17:51.124 --> 1:17:52.501
Coach.

1:17:54.836 --> 1:17:55.879
The brand.

1:17:58.340 --> 1:17:59.466
Gaines.

1:17:59.549 --> 1:18:00.759
Coach Gaines.

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:21.822
Motherfucker.

1:18:29.913 --> 1:18:31.665
What are you doing here, Terron?

1:18:33.750 --> 1:18:34.793
You were right.

1:18:35.293 --> 1:18:38.380
I lost my eligibility,
so now I can't even play for my old team.

1:18:38.964 --> 1:18:41.466
But people are saying
you paid players before.

1:18:41.550 --> 1:18:43.844
This isn't the first time. Is that true?

1:18:44.302 --> 1:18:45.345
Yeah, it's true.

1:18:46.179 --> 1:18:50.183
You have to. You can't compete in
this game if you don't do that, Terron.

1:18:52.686 --> 1:18:56.732
I wish these fuckers making the rules
would come meet you and your family.

1:18:57.774 --> 1:19:00.527
And then try to tell me
I shouldn't help you out.

1:19:00.819 --> 1:19:04.030
The thing's rigged against
the people it should be helping.

1:19:04.573 --> 1:19:07.409
You didn't have to be like that
with my dad, though.

1:19:07.784 --> 1:19:08.952
I'm sorry about that.

1:19:10.078 --> 1:19:12.372
No way I'd let you play for that scumbag.

1:19:12.914 --> 1:19:15.959
-They call him Coach Midnight.

1:19:16.042 --> 1:19:19.004
He steals people's players
in the middle of the night.

1:19:19.463 --> 1:19:21.757
-No.

1:19:22.299 --> 1:19:25.218
I met you at a reasonable hour.
It was, like, 8 p.m.

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:29.473
So, in that case, I guess
you're like Coach Dinnertime.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:33.018
Yeah, I guess.

1:19:33.101 --> 1:19:35.896
Well, I'm not Coach Anything
at the moment, am I?

1:19:41.735 --> 1:19:44.654
I'm sorry you had to lose your job
like that, coach.

1:19:46.114 --> 1:19:51.203
-Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's great.

1:19:51.286 --> 1:19:54.539
How's school? I hear Liberty's
playing you guys pretty soon.

1:19:54.623 --> 1:19:57.501
-No.

1:19:58.251 --> 1:20:01.213
-Nobody would touch me now.

1:20:03.089 --> 1:20:05.008
That means you need a job, right?

1:20:07.010 --> 1:20:08.136
You got something?

1:20:14.309 --> 1:20:15.227
What?

1:20:18.522 --> 1:20:19.481
What?

1:20:20.649 --> 1:20:23.193
<i>What's up,</i>
<i>I know I haven't posted in a minute.</i>

1:20:23.276 --> 1:20:25.320
<i>I'm on my way to a meeting right now.</i>

1:20:26.696 --> 1:20:29.491
<i>Gonna talk about my idea,</i>
<i>somewhere, all the way up there.</i>

1:20:29.574 --> 1:20:33.787
<i>On my way to meet with my coach. He got</i>
<i>a few people with me to connect with.</i>

1:20:33.870 --> 1:20:37.290
<i>I don't know if it's gonna work.</i>
<i>Trying to connect the pieces.</i>

1:20:38.250 --> 1:20:41.962
<i>Been taking a bunch more meetings.</i>
<i>So, I guess my idea's not crazy.</i>

1:20:42.629 --> 1:20:44.798
<i>I can't tell you guys</i>
<i>anything about it.</i>

1:20:46.842 --> 1:20:50.720
<i>That's all y'all can see now.</i>
<i>But you guys will see in the future.</i>

1:20:53.265 --> 1:20:55.016
<i>The Liberty boys pulling up.</i>

1:20:55.308 --> 1:20:58.979
<i>Long time in the van.</i>
<i>Haven't seen these guys in a minute.</i>

1:20:59.062 --> 1:21:01.606
<i>Ah, Coach Curtis. </i>

1:21:02.858 --> 1:21:03.900
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1:21:05.193 --> 1:21:08.989
<i>Terron, didn't you learn your lesson?</i>
<i>You might wanna turn that thing off.</i>

1:21:09.489 --> 1:21:11.116
<i>Hey, yeah, you right, coach.</i>

1:21:12.826 --> 1:21:15.203
Hey, T. It's crazy in there.

1:21:15.287 --> 1:21:17.789
Everybody wants to see you play
your old team.

1:21:20.500 --> 1:21:22.878
Oh, coach. You got my old jersey, right?

1:21:22.961 --> 1:21:25.672
I know you wanna play,
but you can't with the investigation.

1:21:25.755 --> 1:21:29.509
You gotta let me play Liberty.
I got a plan. The team is onboard.

1:21:30.427 --> 1:21:33.805
-We're never gonna beat them.

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:36.433
If I play, the forfeit
counts as a loss, right?

1:21:36.516 --> 1:21:38.560
So, if we're gonna lose, let me play.

1:21:39.561 --> 1:21:42.230
Have my jersey ready.
I gotta take care of something.

1:21:48.862 --> 1:21:51.031
Oh, there you are. Let's go.

1:21:54.075 --> 1:21:55.076
Come on.

1:21:58.038 --> 1:22:00.916
Dad, chill.

1:22:00.999 --> 1:22:03.251
-Terron.
-Ma, trust me. Come on.

1:22:04.711 --> 1:22:05.629
Coach.

1:22:06.046 --> 1:22:08.131
Listen, Vince, Nia.

1:22:08.214 --> 1:22:10.884
I know I'm the last person
you expected to see,

1:22:10.967 --> 1:22:14.137
but I'm here because your son
is about to change the game.

1:22:14.304 --> 1:22:17.098
Why don't you explain it to them.
It was your idea.

1:22:17.307 --> 1:22:18.892
I'm giving up my amateur status,

1:22:19.684 --> 1:22:22.062
renouncing my high school
and college eligibility.

1:22:22.145 --> 1:22:24.648
Coach is gonna be my agent,
we're doing an endorsement deal.

1:22:24.731 --> 1:22:26.816
-I'm going pro.

1:22:27.484 --> 1:22:29.653
Terron, if he's pushing you,
you don't--

1:22:29.736 --> 1:22:34.324
-No, Ma. This is my plan. All my plan.

1:22:34.407 --> 1:22:37.994
They do it in tennis, golf and gymnastics,
but not basketball.

1:22:38.578 --> 1:22:41.456
Terron's gonna be the first one
to do it in the U.S.

1:22:41.539 --> 1:22:44.960
-The first.

1:22:45.043 --> 1:22:47.879
Overseas.
Players like Ricky Rubio and Tony Parker

1:22:47.963 --> 1:22:51.091
signed their first contracts
when they were Terron's age.

1:22:51.174 --> 1:22:54.594
-That's why I'm going international, Ma.

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:57.973
Other countries don't have
the same restrictions we do here.

1:22:58.056 --> 1:23:00.725
And that allows the players
to work year-round

1:23:00.809 --> 1:23:05.105
and get paid, instead of limiting training
by making them play for free.

1:23:05.188 --> 1:23:09.526
We wanna take that advantage to Terron
when he's old enough to play in the NBA.

1:23:09.609 --> 1:23:11.194
Show them the deal, coach.

1:23:11.277 --> 1:23:14.155
Ma, the brands even had
a bidding war. That's crazy.

1:23:14.239 --> 1:23:17.575
It's true.
We received multiple endorsement offers.

1:23:17.659 --> 1:23:22.163
But this is by far the best one.
It's a multi-year deal, as you can see,

1:23:22.247 --> 1:23:24.791
it comes with a significant signing bonus.

1:23:24.874 --> 1:23:27.669
-They've even got this for us.
It's true.

1:23:27.752 --> 1:23:31.840
They wanna fly us to their headquarters
to make the presentation face-to-face.

1:23:32.799 --> 1:23:36.678
They see your son as a potential
superstar, and not just on the court.

1:23:36.761 --> 1:23:41.516
No, they are eager to tap into his
growing social-media presence as well.

1:23:41.599 --> 1:23:44.853
-Dad. It's not like that.

1:23:44.936 --> 1:23:48.023
Listen, I know I've made some mistakes.
I own that.

1:23:48.106 --> 1:23:52.318
But I've always done what I thought
is best for Terron, and that stands here.

1:23:57.032 --> 1:23:59.784
I'm doing this so we can stay together.
All of us.

1:23:59.868 --> 1:24:02.454
You can do that.

1:24:02.537 --> 1:24:04.706
You're the best teacher in the world.
Homeschool me.

1:24:04.789 --> 1:24:09.627
You wouldn't even have to work, Ma.
And neither do you, Dad. I got us.

1:24:11.087 --> 1:24:14.966
-I thought about that already.

1:24:15.050 --> 1:24:17.927
-Tell them about the insurance.
-When he signs a pro contract,

1:24:18.011 --> 1:24:20.055
we take out an insurance policy.

1:24:20.138 --> 1:24:22.474
If he gets injured or anything happens--

1:24:22.557 --> 1:24:24.934
The family's taken care of.
Now do you see?

1:24:29.272 --> 1:24:30.315
Is it enough?

1:24:31.149 --> 1:24:32.108
Uh...

1:24:32.525 --> 1:24:34.778
Baby, it's more than enough.

1:24:35.945 --> 1:24:38.990
Okay, good.
We can take a trip together.

1:24:39.074 --> 1:24:42.285
You look through all the numbers.
I got a game to play.

1:25:35.004 --> 1:25:37.006
There's a problem with your plan.

1:25:37.590 --> 1:25:40.718
If you play, it's not an official game.

1:25:40.802 --> 1:25:43.680
I was set to forfeit
so you could be out there,

1:25:43.763 --> 1:25:46.850
but they won't let me use the gym
for a non-official game.

1:25:48.476 --> 1:25:50.395
-More red tape.
-More red tape.

1:25:53.439 --> 1:25:54.440
I got this.

1:26:08.538 --> 1:26:10.874
Um, so, I can't play tonight--

1:26:19.090 --> 1:26:23.011
The rules say
that I'm ineligible to play, so...

1:26:31.394 --> 1:26:32.937
But I say forget the rules.

1:26:44.073 --> 1:26:46.701
Refs, y'all can go home,
turn off the scoreboard,

1:26:46.784 --> 1:26:49.579
because we can't play in here.
But what we can do--

1:26:49.662 --> 1:26:52.540
We can play out there, right?
Let's go play.
