00:35.285 --> 00:37.054
One minute out for POI.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.764
- LZ's hot.
- Roger that.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.349
We're putting down a point of
injury, middle of a firefight.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.809
It means we get in, get out.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.270
How long did it take to
get used to this, Grace?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.522
Long time, Bobby. But
you're doing good.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.906
Just stay close.
We got your back.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.758
Pilot: Hang on back there.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.385
It might get rocky.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.427
Mom?

02:18.638 --> 02:19.806
Mom?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.327
Abraham.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.620
Abraham.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.104
Abraham!

02:30.108 --> 02:31.985
Mom?

02:34.571 --> 02:38.551
Levi, thank God.

02:38.575 --> 02:42.429
- - I told them... hide.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.598
Hide in the barn.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.017
In the barn.

02:47.041 --> 02:50.544
Hold this, okay? Hold tight.

02:50.545 --> 02:54.465
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.410
Woman: Okay, Grandma,

03:04.434 --> 03:06.620
should we go over this again?

03:06.644 --> 03:09.331
I takethe Monday
pills on Monday,

03:09.355 --> 03:11.398
- the Tuesday pills on Tuesday...
You know what I mean.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.359
It's important that you
know what each of these do

03:13.383 --> 03:14.903
so you don't have
another heart attack.

03:14.927 --> 03:16.797
I just needed a
little jumpstart,

03:16.821 --> 03:19.421
- that's all.- Next you'll be telling
me you faked the whole thing

03:19.445 --> 03:21.256
to get me to come home
from Afghanistan.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.803
- You're onto me.- Mm-hmm.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.890
Why don't you go inand help
your sister with her homework?

03:25.914 --> 03:28.017
Oh, I already tried. She
doesn't need my help.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.852
I can hear you.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.687
Well, maybe she just missed me.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.064
Not really. No.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.256
She's growing up.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.068
We need to give her her space.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.661
- Elizabeth!- Grandma?

03:47.685 --> 03:49.854
Grace?

03:54.025 --> 03:57.904
- What is it?- It's
Levi from next door.

04:00.406 --> 04:04.011
- Levi.- Elizabeth.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.763
My mother has been shot.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.454
- -She's with child.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.456
Please, she needs help.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.352
- Uh, Grace?- Here, here.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.687
Call 9-1-1.Keep
this door locked.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.088
I can help.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.983
Hurry, hurry. This way.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.986
Up here.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.381
No, no, no. He's gone.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.031
Please. My mom!

04:45.535 --> 04:47.680
I brought help.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.584
Okay, I just need you to
step back for me, okay?

04:49.608 --> 04:51.892
Just step back. It's okay.
It's okay.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.519
Hi, ma'am. Hi.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.438
Hi there. I'm a nurse, okay?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.898
Okay, I'm gonna take good
care of you and the baby.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.274
I just need you to stay with me.

04:59.298 --> 05:00.901
It's okay. It's all right.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.736
I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.013
We're gonna take
good care of you.

05:07.181 --> 05:09.683
Levi, the kinder...

05:09.684 --> 05:12.037
Take them to my sister.
They will be safe there.

05:12.061 --> 05:16.024
I will, and then I'll come
to be with you and the babe.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.548
Please, will I lose the babe?

05:22.572 --> 05:24.282
Not on my watch, Mrs. Miller.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.369
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

05:44.093 --> 05:47.948
Albert? Sarah?

05:47.972 --> 05:51.076
- Albert?
- Is the bad man gone?

05:51.100 --> 05:55.205
Yes, yes, he's gone. Come.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.000
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.419
Where's Dad and Mom?

06:00.443 --> 06:02.445
Why did they not come for us?

06:23.841 --> 06:25.944
You're Grace,

06:25.968 --> 06:28.137
Elizabeth's granddaughter.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.391
Thank you.

06:33.601 --> 06:38.624
This little pile of hay
is my brother Albert,

06:38.648 --> 06:41.627
and this is my
little sister Sarah.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.212
It's nice to meet you.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.094
- Danke.
- Danke.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.138
I told them that you're the
one that helped our mother.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.556
They thank you.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.916
You're... you're welcome.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.858
Levi, can I give you a
ride to your aunt's?

07:04.882 --> 07:06.800
Yes.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.469
I would be grateful.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.751
Levi: Wait here, Albert.

08:04.775 --> 08:08.487
- Levi?- Aunt Rose.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.551
It's good to see you.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.785
You have grown.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.125
Claire's not with you?

08:22.376 --> 08:26.815
A man came into our home.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.007
He had a gun.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.010
He killed Abraham.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.059
And my sister?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.791
Ma'am, I'm Grace. I'm a medic.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.733
Claire's also been
shot, but she's alive.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.087
She's been taken by
ambulance to the hospital,

08:49.111 --> 08:51.131
and they're focused on
saving her and the baby.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.343
Baby?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.243
- Henry.- Rose?

08:56.244 --> 08:58.180
Is that Levi?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.746
My sister has been shot.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.415
- She was with
child.- Oh, my God.

09:02.416 --> 09:06.396
I would take it as a kindness

09:06.420 --> 09:08.273
if you would care for
my brother and sister

09:08.297 --> 09:11.151
while I go to be with my mother.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.885
Oh, of course.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.140
It'll be good to
get to know them.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.790
Your family will
be in our prayers.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.525
Thank you.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.768
You know, I don't...

09:44.792 --> 09:49.106
I don't know that much
about your, uh, community,

09:49.130 --> 09:52.609
but I... I know what it's like to
lose someone, and I'm very sorry.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.011
I will miss my stepfather.

09:57.305 --> 10:01.994
Elizabeth told me how your
sister came to live with her...

10:02.018 --> 10:04.955
The car accident that
took your parents.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.540
Yeah.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.817
It's good to have
family at these times.

10:10.818 --> 10:15.007
You know, I haven't really been
back here that much since.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.801
I joined the Army
after high school.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.094
They put me through college

10:19.118 --> 10:22.597
and I was on active duty by 22.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.497
Do you not like it here?

10:24.498 --> 10:26.476
No, I... no, I...

10:26.500 --> 10:29.021
It's beautiful here.

10:29.045 --> 10:34.007
I just think I never
really felt a connection.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.696
I think your parents would
have been very proud of you.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.556
Thank you.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.693
We're here to see Claire Miller.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.422
- Are you Levi?- I am.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.425
Hi, I'm Dr. Allen. I
operated on your mother.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.762
Her wounds were serious, but
you got her here quickly.

11:01.786 --> 11:05.098
- I'm expecting a full
recovery.- And then the babe?

11:05.122 --> 11:07.100
We had to do an
emergency C-section.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.043
He's under observationin
the NICU upstairs.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.962
My mother had a son?

11:13.089 --> 11:16.777
Levi, I'm sorry for your loss.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.070
Thank you.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.988
- Sheriff Newsome.-
Grace Connor.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.221
Oh, Elizabeth's granddaughter.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.658
- Yeah.-Nice to meet you.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.243
- This is Deputy Small.- Ma'am.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.205
- You're Grace?-
Yeah, that's right.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.499
Claire asked to
see you actually.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.042
Uh, but I don't even know her.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.170
She was very specific...
the Englisher named Grace.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.697
Go ahead. We need to ask
Levi some questions anyway.

11:43.702 --> 11:47.641
This is all just standard
procedure, Levi.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.083
Okay.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.407
How're you feeling?

12:03.431 --> 12:06.576
You are Elizabeth's Grace.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.496
She speaks of you often.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.564
My Abraham...

12:13.649 --> 12:15.401
he is gone?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.696
I'm so sorry.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.220
It's gonna be okay.

12:25.244 --> 12:30.600
Mrs. Miller, I'm very
sorry for your loss.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.186
Abraham was a good man.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.128
Thank you.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.523
I know it's hard right now,

12:36.547 --> 12:40.467
but I need to find
out who did this.

12:40.468 --> 12:44.281
He was an Englisher.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.909
He wore a mask and gloves.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.745
Was he tall? Short?

12:49.769 --> 12:54.458
I don't remember.
It happened fast.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.067
Do you know why he would come
afteryou and your husband?

12:58.611 --> 13:02.466
He spoke about the horse Abraham

13:02.490 --> 13:04.742
sold at auction yesterday.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.512
My husband gave him
all the money,

13:07.536 --> 13:08.995
but he thought we had more.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.058
He was very angry.

13:12.082 --> 13:15.502
He pointed the gun at me.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.647
I ran away.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.548
And Abraham jumped.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.428
- He tried... Abraham
tried to protect you?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.036
Why would a man do this?

13:31.060 --> 13:36.541
Abraham would give anything
to someone in need.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.692
They don't need a gun.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.343
We're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.727
Have you noticed anything unusual
happening at the Miller's?

13:48.751 --> 13:50.847
- Anybody hanging around?- No.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.705
But I've only been
back a few days.

13:52.706 --> 13:56.728
I'm gonna swing by and talk to
your grandmother and Becky.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.104
Yeah.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.357
You know, Sheriff, Claire
said that that guy

14:00.381 --> 14:02.234
knew about the money
from the auction.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.698
I mean, he would
only know about that

14:03.722 --> 14:05.237
if he was from
around here, right?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.655
Yeah, we've had a
couple robberies

14:06.679 --> 14:08.823
in the Amish community recently.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.724
Well, the Amish, they
don't fight back,

14:11.725 --> 14:13.227
which makes them vulnerable.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.939
We've never had
anything like this.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.259
Sheriff, I put the word
out about Owen Peterson.

14:27.283 --> 14:30.011
- Nobody's seen him.-
Owen Peterson?

14:30.035 --> 14:33.413
He's a local boy convicted
of drug charges.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.684
He got released from
prison a couple weeks ago.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.394
Is he a suspect?

14:37.418 --> 14:39.145
Right now I just
wanna talk to him.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.855
So I'm finished?

14:40.879 --> 14:43.299
For now, Levi. Thank you.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.177
Thanks, Sheriff. Thank you.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.533
So, your mother's resting comfortably.
She just fell asleep.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.517
That's good.

14:54.643 --> 14:57.581
I would like to see
my brother now.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.149
Come on.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.785
I'm sorry.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.731
First time in an elevator?

15:22.755 --> 15:25.341
Of course not. Our
house has two.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.350
Here he is.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.645
You have five minutes, okay?
Then I need to take him back.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.189
Thank you, doctor.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.317
Levi, this is Daniel.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.195
Daniel.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.156
Hello, Daniel.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.243
Our mother gave you a fine name.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.248
You will grow to be a good man.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.689
Grace: Grandma, I didn't realize

16:04.713 --> 16:06.233
that you were so close
to the Millers.

16:06.257 --> 16:10.111
Well, as close as an
Englisher can be.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.490
The doctor mentioned that
they were ultraconservative

16:13.514 --> 16:15.181
- even for Amish.
- Mm.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.576
Swartzentrubers.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.703
They can't even
marry other Amish.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.039
They have to marry
within their own sect.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.666
Wow, that's so strict.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.627
I remember when Levi
was a young boy

16:25.651 --> 16:28.380
and I used to share
books with him.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.966
He absolutely loved.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.467
"Harold and the Purple Crayon."

16:32.491 --> 16:34.219
That was allowed?

16:34.243 --> 16:36.221
Well, I think that Claire knew

16:36.245 --> 16:38.473
he had a more inquisitive mind

16:38.497 --> 16:40.141
than most boys his age.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.728
Abraham, though, he
didn't want Levi

16:43.752 --> 16:45.378
to read anything but the Bible,

16:45.379 --> 16:48.692
so he came over here one
day and told me to stop.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.556
Becky: I saw some other
members of their church

16:50.580 --> 16:52.320
already at his house today.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.571
Mmm.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.907
They take great
care of each other,

16:55.931 --> 16:58.391
and I'm sure they're over
there cooking and cleaning,

16:58.392 --> 17:01.538
feeding the animals,
watching the children.

17:01.562 --> 17:05.083
No, we took the kids over
to Claire's sister's house.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.836
- Rose?- Mm-hmm.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.046
And Claire knew about it?

17:10.069 --> 17:11.964
It was her idea.

17:11.989 --> 17:16.886
Claire hasn't spoken to her
sister in over ten years.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.637
They used to be so close,

17:18.662 --> 17:22.016
and then Rose married
outside the sect

17:22.040 --> 17:24.144
and the family shunned her.

17:24.167 --> 17:27.003
I couldn't imagine never
talking to you again.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.632
What're you doing?
You scared me.

17:54.656 --> 17:57.135
I just decided to have
some dessert outside,

17:57.159 --> 17:59.137
watch the moon come up.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.640
Becky, I really wish that you
wouldn't go out this late at night,

18:02.664 --> 18:04.504
not when there's that
crazy guy running around.

18:04.528 --> 18:06.280
It's a scary situation.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.048
Do you ever get scared?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.718
Yeah, every day.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.659
Hey, look,

18:21.683 --> 18:23.912
what happened to the Miller
family was terrible,

18:23.936 --> 18:25.136
and I know that you're worried,

18:25.160 --> 18:26.440
but they're gonna catch this guy

18:26.464 --> 18:27.678
and they're gonna put him away

18:27.702 --> 18:29.459
so that he can't
hurt anyone else.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.163
But in the meantime, will you just
promise me that you'll stay close

18:32.187 --> 18:34.207
so that me and Grandma don't
have to keep worrying?

18:34.231 --> 18:36.198
Are you going back?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.636
You know what? It's late.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.980
I think we should
talk about it...

18:41.004 --> 18:43.348
I heard you guys talking.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.475
I know it's time for
you to reenlist.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.561
They gave me a little extra time
because of Grandma's heart attack.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.689
- So...- What're you gonna do?

18:51.713 --> 18:54.925
Honey, they really
need me over there.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.721
And we need you here.

21:07.516 --> 21:11.704
Elizabeth, you know the
Millers as well as anyone.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.956
Had they talked to you lately

21:12.980 --> 21:14.207
about people making threats,

21:14.231 --> 21:15.458
anything like that?

21:15.482 --> 21:17.961
No, not at all.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.922
But, you know, they're
not much for talking.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.257
Well, Levi's alibi checked out.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.009
He was at the blacksmith
when it happened.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.512
You couldn't possibly
think that Levi...

21:27.536 --> 21:29.305
No, but we have to
check everyone.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.599
And speaking of which,
is Becky home yet?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.663
We'd like to speak to her
as well if you don't mind.

21:33.687 --> 21:35.353
She's still at school.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.737
I'll have one of my deputies
swing by in the next day or so.

21:37.761 --> 21:39.357
Whatever we can do
to help, Sheriff.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.943
Any luck tracking down
that Owen Peterson guy?

21:41.967 --> 21:45.446
No, but I wanted to
mention something.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.179
It rained the night
before the murder,

21:47.180 --> 21:49.283
and we found some
muddy footprints

21:49.307 --> 21:51.202
which I believe
belong to our killer.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.704
Where?

21:52.728 --> 21:54.372
In the field behind
your property.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.166
We're constantly
patrolling that area,

21:57.190 --> 21:59.210
but keep your doors locked.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.694
Okay.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.134
Did Becky say which friend

22:06.158 --> 22:07.844
she was studying
with after school?

22:07.868 --> 22:10.536
She's doing a
project with Lilly.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.640
She said she'd be
home for dinner.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.957
All right.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.601
Voicemail: Hi, it's Becky.
Leave a message.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.526
- I'll get back to you.
- Hey, it's me.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.446
Just wondering if you're on
your way home for dinner.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.013
Give me a call.

23:04.925 --> 23:08.260
Hey, buddy. Are you lost?

23:08.261 --> 23:12.784
Now I know why Becky's been
sneaking food out here, huh?

23:12.808 --> 23:15.811
Whew. You scared me.

23:54.307 --> 23:56.702
So, you've met.

23:56.726 --> 24:00.623
Yeah, maybe we should
call the shelter and, uh,

24:00.647 --> 24:02.208
see if anyone's looking for him.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.985
Already did. He's
officially homeless.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.091
You missed dinner.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.159
I left a couple of messages.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.263
Yeah, I turned off my
phone so I could study.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.266
Look, Becky, this is exactly
what I was talking about,

24:18.290 --> 24:20.893
about staying in close touch.

24:20.917 --> 24:23.938
We didn't know where you were.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.338
I'm not a kid anymore, Grace.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.659
I can take care of myself just
fine when you're not around.

24:28.683 --> 24:30.027
Okay, but this is different.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.696
There's a dangerous
man running around,

24:31.720 --> 24:33.480
and Grandma really doesn't
need anything else

24:33.504 --> 24:35.783
- to worry about.- I'm sorry.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.019
I didn't mean to
make anybody worry.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.459
Morning.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.295
Whoa. You have a dog now.

25:29.319 --> 25:33.198
Uh, apparently. No
one's claimed him.

25:34.574 --> 25:38.095
Ah. Animals know
when they're wanted.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.246
This one will be happy to
stay here for a while.

25:42.415 --> 25:43.851
How's your mother?

25:43.875 --> 25:46.418
She and Daniel come home soon.

25:46.419 --> 25:48.272
Ah, wonderful.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.524
Well, I'll, uh... I'll
come by and say hello

25:50.548 --> 25:52.443
if that's okay, when
they get settled.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.613
I'd like that.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.931
For my... for my mother.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.952
Yeah.

26:00.976 --> 26:06.582
I, uh, noticed that
your medical bag

26:06.606 --> 26:08.543
was falling apart.

26:08.567 --> 26:14.947
This should hold your
things more securely.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.909
It has compartments within.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.293
You made this, Levi?

26:27.460 --> 26:30.564
From the wood of a maple tree.

26:30.588 --> 26:33.359
- Abraham taught
me.- It's beautiful.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.653
I... I don't know what to say.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.196
Thank you.

26:37.220 --> 26:42.451
For all that you've
done for us...

26:42.475 --> 26:44.829
this makes us even.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.748
Even? I thought it was a gift.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.126
No.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.152
No, that... that
wouldn't be proper

26:53.153 --> 26:55.631
for me to give you a gift.

26:55.655 --> 27:00.785
Right. Um, okay,
then we're even.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.622
Okay then.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.913
A sad day, Levi.

27:27.937 --> 27:31.917
At least Abraham is no longer
part of this sinful world.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.920
But a man should live long
enough to raise his children.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.363
Abraham would've
wished to do so.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.531
It is your duty to be a father

27:39.532 --> 27:42.345
to the little ones now
and to help your mother.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.305
A duty I willingly accept.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.141
It would be a great comfort
to your mother, Levi,

27:47.165 --> 27:49.208
if you were to
select a good frau.

27:49.209 --> 27:53.189
Most Amish men your age already
have a wife and children.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.775
My daughter Zillah
knows what it takes

27:55.799 --> 27:58.426
to run a Swartzentruber
household.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.489
A sad day, Claire,

28:01.513 --> 28:03.407
but Abraham is with God now.

28:03.431 --> 28:05.767
Thank you, Zillah.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.331
Levi, if there is
anything I can do

28:10.355 --> 28:12.500
to help bring comfort
to your family,

28:12.524 --> 28:14.001
I hope that you'll call on me.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.670
We have been blessed by
many from the church

28:16.694 --> 28:18.506
who have given their help.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.073
And knowing you since
we were children

28:21.074 --> 28:23.010
has been a blessing for me.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.763
I must see to my mother.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.331
Oh, please, let me.

28:33.002 --> 28:36.256
- God's will.- God's will.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.095
Hello, Levi.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.431
Grace.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.267
Hi, Claire.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.102
Grandma sent this
from the family.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.903
She said she wishes she
could be here herself,

28:51.927 --> 28:54.750
but she wanted me to tell
you how sorry we are.

28:54.774 --> 28:57.943
Thank you, Grace.

28:57.944 --> 29:00.715
- - Ooh.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.259
He's not feeling well.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.953
Really? Oh.What does
the doctor say?

29:07.954 --> 29:10.933
I have not spoken to the doctor.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.977
Would you come tomorrow

29:13.001 --> 29:15.127
to see what is wrong
with my Daniel?

29:15.128 --> 29:18.798
Absolutely. First
thing in the morning.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.369
It's time for us to begin.

29:30.393 --> 29:34.957
There will be no English
spoken here today.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.483
My mother and I thank
you for coming.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.253
Sorry for your loss.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.404
Thank you.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.409
Grandma, what're you doing?

30:10.433 --> 30:11.994
You're supposed to
be taking it easy.

30:12.018 --> 30:15.039
Well, this is my idea of
physical therapy, honey.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.855
It does my heart good
to cook for you girls.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.357
Uh-huh.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.711
- Where's Becky?-
Uh, she's out back

30:20.735 --> 30:22.735
putting some boxes in her
car for a school project.

30:22.759 --> 30:25.549
Hmm. She's really
buckling down this year.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.301
- I'm impressed.-Yeah.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.165
She's volunteering more
than ever at the church

30:29.189 --> 30:31.524
with the, uh, prison ministry.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.476
Prison ministry?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.603
They write letters to the
inmates to cheer 'em up.

30:37.627 --> 30:42.233
Oh, nice. She's just got
some criminals as pen pals?

30:42.257 --> 30:43.818
Don't worry. I spoke
to Pastor Bruce.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.946
It's kinda like
community service.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.405
Oh, breakfast bacon,

30:48.429 --> 30:51.015
the most important
bacon of the day.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.081
- Ooh.- I am gonna pretend
I didn't see that.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.707
Hey, Dusty likes bacon, too.

30:58.731 --> 31:01.001
- Dusty?- Uh, yeah,

31:01.025 --> 31:03.295
like what they call you when
you're in Afghanistan...

31:03.319 --> 31:05.172
Dust off flight medic.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.300
He'll be like a reminder for
us when you have to go back.

31:08.324 --> 31:12.911
- I like it.- Dusty.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.497
It's perfect.

31:42.650 --> 31:46.380
We tried tincture of
fennel seed for colic,

31:46.404 --> 31:49.383
but it didn't help.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.284
Yeah, I'm not so
sure this is colic.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.722
Claire, after you feed
Daniel, how do you hold him?

31:54.746 --> 31:58.123
The same as all my babes.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.311
I want to try something.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.211
Come here. Hi, sweetie.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.275
I know. I know. I know.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.052
Shh. Shh. Shh.Shh. Shh. Shh.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.868
Did either of you get
any sleep last night?

32:17.602 --> 32:19.811
Not much.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.052
Why don't you go get some rest?

32:21.076 --> 32:22.995
I'll keep an eye on him.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.780
Danke.

32:30.657 --> 32:33.242
Shh. Shh. I know.

32:35.161 --> 32:38.163
See, this is what I
love about babies.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.768
The little guys only
cryfor a reason.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.836
Find the reason,
you stop crying.

32:46.714 --> 32:50.259
Wish the rest of the world
made that much sense.

32:55.598 --> 32:56.617
He's sleeping?

32:56.641 --> 32:57.910
Shh.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.162
I think I know what's going on.

33:00.186 --> 33:03.272
And if I'm right, everybody around
here will be sleeping better.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.490
We need to work on your
brother's social skills.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.868
I stand corrected.

33:16.869 --> 33:20.641
The women of our church
keep us very well-fed.

33:20.665 --> 33:24.377
I prefer the ones with the
little chocolate pieces.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.755
Thank you.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.652
So it must be nice having
your aunt around here

33:31.676 --> 33:34.738
- after so long?- Yes.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.556
She's sweet.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.892
Oh, it works very well, Levi.

33:40.893 --> 33:44.272
I'm gonna be the envy of all the
other medics when I go back.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.584
So you're going back to the war?

33:47.608 --> 33:50.379
Yeah, I think so.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.381
You know, they really
need me over there.

33:52.405 --> 33:57.660
But, hey, I'm happy to have
made a friend while I was back.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.750
We are not friends, Grace.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.670
We can't be friends.

35:11.984 --> 35:16.507
- Bishop Weaver. Good
morning.-What are you doing here?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.657
We will care for this child.

35:18.658 --> 35:19.927
You are not needed.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.805
I think that's for
Claire to decide.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.372
He's sleeping.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.085
Bishop Weaver.

35:30.253 --> 35:34.066
Rose Fisher? You must go.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.401
Our people will tend to
Claire and this family.

35:36.425 --> 35:39.177
She is Swartzentruber.
You are not.

35:39.178 --> 35:42.032
I am aware of who and what I am.

35:42.056 --> 35:45.160
I will see Abraham's wife now.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.995
My mother is sleeping.

35:47.019 --> 35:49.122
This is the first rest
she's had in days.

35:49.146 --> 35:52.626
Levi, Abraham has been
gone ten days now.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.836
You will tell your aunt

35:53.860 --> 35:55.546
and this English woman to leave.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.697
Rose has been a great
help in our time of need,

35:58.698 --> 36:01.718
and Grace saved
my mother's life.

36:01.742 --> 36:06.557
Tomorrow, I will send my daughter to
live here until your mother heals.

36:06.581 --> 36:10.918
She knows what it takes to run
a Swartzentruber household.

36:13.713 --> 36:18.443
I will make lunch
while I still can.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.612
Thank you, Rose.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.906
I know he's your bishop,
but I don't like that guy.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.575
It's hard to be sure,

36:24.599 --> 36:27.268
but I'd say he doesn't
care much for you, either.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.377
Grace: Do you remember
what was there?

36:35.401 --> 36:38.630
Gosh, it's been so
long, I don't...

36:38.654 --> 36:42.718
Huh. Well, is anything
else missing?

36:42.742 --> 36:44.902
Do you think this has anything
to do with the robberies

36:44.926 --> 36:47.720
that the sheriff was
telling you about?

36:49.373 --> 36:52.250
Didn't Grandpa keep a collection
of fishing lures there?

36:52.251 --> 36:55.355
He always said those lures
would fetch a pretty penny.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.357
That's so strange.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.257
I remember what was there.

36:59.258 --> 37:02.427
- What?- It was an antique
mirror from my dresser.

37:02.428 --> 37:05.096
It had those sweet little
drawers underneath.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.265
You remember, it was
in the house forever.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.162
- Mm.- Grace, what is going on?

37:10.186 --> 37:12.605
Why would somebody want
to take those things?

37:14.440 --> 37:16.776
You know, I should
call the sheriff.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.763
All right. Thank you, Sheriff.
I will.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.580
Bye-bye.

37:32.124 --> 37:35.729
Well, they said that they'll send
someone over a little bit later.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.522
- Thanks.- Yeah.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.900
So I have to head into town

37:39.924 --> 37:41.164
to get a few things for Claire.

37:41.188 --> 37:43.362
You want to join me?

37:43.386 --> 37:46.304
Do you think I'm afraid to stay
alone in my own home, Grace?

37:46.305 --> 37:49.159
No, of course not. I just thought
you might like a change of scenery.

37:49.183 --> 37:52.663
You are not fooling anybody.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.290
But you just happen
to be right, too.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.441
I am getting a bit
of cabin fever.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.921
Rose: I must go before I bring

38:00.945 --> 38:02.153
more trouble to your family.

38:02.154 --> 38:05.509
This is not my wish, Rose.

38:05.533 --> 38:09.054
Nor mine, but your
kinder miss you.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.890
They will be happy to come home.

38:11.914 --> 38:15.978
We will be very sad
to see you go.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.522
You've been a great help.

38:18.546 --> 38:23.174
I will walk into town
to call my Henry.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.821
He'll come tomorrow.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.031
I'm sorry we have no phone.

38:28.055 --> 38:31.451
We have learned lately it
can be a blessing in need.

38:31.475 --> 38:35.354
- God's will.- God's will.

38:38.524 --> 38:41.628
I think I know why Claire's
baby's struggling.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.797
Is that why we're going to town?

38:43.821 --> 38:47.700
Well, that, plus
your cabin fever.

38:50.703 --> 38:54.182
- So, how's Levi?- I
don't understand.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.685
You and Claire can be friends,
but Levi and I can't.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.061
He said that?

38:58.085 --> 39:01.398
"We are not friends, Grace.
We cannot be friends."

39:01.422 --> 39:05.152
Well, that was no ordinary
basket he gave you.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.887
So?

39:16.187 --> 39:17.622
- Wait! Turn!- What is it?

39:17.646 --> 39:20.441
Elizabeth: That's Becky's car.

39:33.412 --> 39:34.913
Just wait here.
I'll handle this.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.207
Okay.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.939
Hey, there.

39:42.963 --> 39:44.422
- Hey.- Hey.

39:44.423 --> 39:46.193
Something wrong, Deputy Small?

39:46.217 --> 39:49.321
No, no. Just talking
with Becky here.

39:49.345 --> 39:53.158
Oh, okay, well, you mind telling
me why you pulled her over?

39:53.182 --> 39:55.035
Well, the sheriff asked
me to talk to her

39:55.059 --> 39:57.829
about what had happened over at your
neighbors' place the other night.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.372
Okay, so you're just chatting

39:59.396 --> 40:01.196
with her out here in the
middle of the street,

40:01.220 --> 40:02.900
embarrassing her in
front of half the town?

40:02.924 --> 40:03.775
It's all right.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.420
I already told him I
didn't see anything.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.799
Okay, she said she
didn't see anything.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.134
Do you have any more questions?

40:11.158 --> 40:14.096
No. No, ma'am. We're all good.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.390
You folks take care now.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.249
You, too.

40:22.044 --> 40:23.188
Hey, you okay?

40:23.212 --> 40:26.006
I told you, I'm fine.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.470
What did he ask you?

40:32.471 --> 40:35.140
- I gotta go.-

40:35.141 --> 40:36.684
Becky.

40:39.395 --> 40:42.332
It's called
infantgastroesophageal reflux.

40:42.356 --> 40:45.252
It's actually
common in preemies.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.819
And what does this
long word mean?

40:49.155 --> 40:51.883
Just think of it
as baby heartburn.

40:51.907 --> 40:54.325
See, Daniel's little throat
muscles aren't developed enough

40:54.326 --> 40:55.971
to keep the stomach acid down.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.163
That's why it's very important
that after you feed him,

40:58.164 --> 41:00.559
you hold him upright for
at least 30 minutes, okay?

41:00.583 --> 41:03.687
What about at night
when he needs to sleep?

41:03.711 --> 41:07.232
Oh, that's what this is for.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.484
It's called an infant
sleeping wedge.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.403
It'll let Daniel lie
safely at an angle

41:11.427 --> 41:14.322
so that the stomach acids
don't come up the wrong way.

41:14.346 --> 41:18.516
You know all this, but you
have no children of your own.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.078
No, but four years
of nursing school,

41:20.102 --> 41:21.686
six years in the field,

41:21.687 --> 41:23.623
the Army made sure I
was well-trained.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.024
Remember, 30 minutes.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.170
Elizabeth: Do you think this
might have anything to do

41:28.194 --> 41:29.880
with whoever attacked
the Millers?

41:29.904 --> 41:33.133
Have you found that
Peterson boy yet?

41:33.157 --> 41:35.051
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves, Elizabeth.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.535
Try to make me a list of
everything that's missing

41:37.536 --> 41:39.704
and I'll get right on it.

41:39.705 --> 41:41.873
Sheriff, I don't even know
what all is out here.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.310
How am I gonna make a list?

41:43.334 --> 41:46.128
Just do your best
as soon as you can.

41:48.547 --> 41:51.818
- All right.- Appreciate it.

41:51.842 --> 41:55.530
Oh, by the way, Deputy Small
told me what happened in town.

41:55.554 --> 41:58.283
You're right, it was
neither the time

41:58.307 --> 42:01.059
nor the place to speak
to your sister.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.938
- It won't happen
again.- Thank you.

42:14.657 --> 42:16.468
Hi.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.743
Hi.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.933
Oh, I'm so sorry about today.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.083
I think I was just worried.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.937
I'm sorry, too.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.189
Um, what did the sheriff say

42:29.213 --> 42:30.482
about the stuff that's missing?

42:30.506 --> 42:33.109
Well, they're gonna
look into it, so...

42:34.593 --> 42:36.136
Sorry.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.786
Is something wrong?

42:42.810 --> 42:45.121
I just need to take
care of something.

42:45.145 --> 42:47.082
You want some help?

42:47.106 --> 42:49.751
It's just school stuff.

42:49.775 --> 42:53.171
Okay. Becky, wait.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.966
Look, I don't know what happened

42:55.990 --> 43:00.118
with the deputy today,
whatever it was.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.599
You know that you can
trust me, right,

43:01.623 --> 43:04.516
no matter how long I'm gone?

43:04.540 --> 43:06.476
And you go and do
whatever you need to do,

43:06.500 --> 43:09.795
but whenever you're ready to
talk, honey, I'm here, okay?

43:10.963 --> 43:12.464
Okay.

43:49.001 --> 43:50.854
- Aunt Rose!- Levi.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.732
Levi, hello!

43:53.756 --> 43:55.483
Come, sit down.

43:55.507 --> 43:57.426
Your lunch is ready.

43:58.927 --> 44:00.429
I hope that you're hungry.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.682
Thank you, Zillah.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.337
How long will your parents be able
to do without you at home, Zillah?

44:15.361 --> 44:17.922
Oh, my father told me to
stay for as long as I want.

44:17.946 --> 44:22.218
Rose, my father told me that
there's no reason for you to stay.

44:22.242 --> 44:26.806
He says that you must go back to
your own family and your own church.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.642
I return to my family tomorrow.

44:29.666 --> 44:33.772
My father says because you
are not Swartzentruber,

44:33.796 --> 44:35.732
we should not be
eating with you.

44:35.756 --> 44:39.944
It was not a decision
made easily, Zillah.

44:39.968 --> 44:42.697
Uh, yes, but my father
has said that...

44:42.721 --> 44:47.393
Perhaps you should not speak so freely
on matters you do not understand.

44:54.608 --> 44:57.069
Let us pray.

45:20.175 --> 45:23.363
Hey, there. Is Claire around?

45:23.387 --> 45:24.739
She is busy with the babe.

45:24.763 --> 45:26.116
Yeah, that's why I came by.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.100
I just wanted to see how
the little guy was doing.

45:28.124 --> 45:29.619
The babe is good.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.913
I'm sorry, I don't think
we got to properly meet.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.337
You were at the funeral, right?
You're the bishop's daughter?

45:34.361 --> 45:36.274
Yes, I am Zillah Weaver.

45:36.275 --> 45:41.798
- I'm Grace.- Nice to meet you.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.615
Your basket... where
did you get it?

45:44.616 --> 45:48.763
Levi made it for me.
Isn't it nice?

45:48.787 --> 45:51.433
I will care for this family now.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.792
You are not needed here.

46:13.372 --> 46:14.372
Levi?

46:14.396 --> 46:17.792
Zillah.

46:17.816 --> 46:19.919
So this is where
you come to hide.

46:19.943 --> 46:22.505
No, I was...

46:22.529 --> 46:24.048
Is something wrong?

46:24.072 --> 46:26.426
Everyone is asleep.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.470
I wanted to show you something.

46:28.494 --> 46:32.056
Show me what?

46:32.080 --> 46:35.727
Well, when my father told
me I'd be living here,

46:35.751 --> 46:37.001
my mother and I spent all day

46:37.002 --> 46:39.022
sewing this beautiful
new nightdress.

46:39.046 --> 46:42.275
- Zillah.- It's pink. Look.

46:42.299 --> 46:43.818
Zillah, please.

46:43.842 --> 46:46.112
Do you not want to see?

46:46.136 --> 46:48.012
You should go.

46:48.013 --> 46:51.015
I have waited so long for you.

46:51.016 --> 46:52.911
I wish for us to be
husband and wife.

46:52.935 --> 46:55.288
My father says that we can
be married right away.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.522
You should not say such things.

46:57.523 --> 46:59.857
Why not?

46:59.858 --> 47:03.194
I do not love you, Zillah.

47:03.195 --> 47:07.675
But, Levi, I could have
anyone in our church.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.470
Any man would be very
happy to be with me.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.389
Then you should choose another.

47:13.413 --> 47:16.226
It's that Englisher.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.709
You have feelings
for her, don't you?

47:18.710 --> 47:21.689
There's nothing between us.

47:21.713 --> 47:24.716
- Yes, you do.- No, please.
Please go.

47:29.763 --> 47:31.556
What is this?

47:31.557 --> 47:33.827
Such things are not
allowed, Levi!

47:33.851 --> 47:36.704
- They are only books.-
They are of the world!

47:36.728 --> 47:38.665
Yes.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.500
Yes, they are, and I read them

47:40.524 --> 47:43.044
because they fill
me with such ideas.

47:43.068 --> 47:45.380
There are so many
different places,

47:45.404 --> 47:47.298
so many different
kinds of people,

47:47.322 --> 47:50.009
more than you could
ever imagine.

47:50.033 --> 47:55.515
Zillah, it would take
your breath away.

47:55.539 --> 48:00.127
My father will want
to know of this.

48:03.297 --> 48:06.526
Do what you think is right.
Now, please go.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.968
Go!

48:42.169 --> 48:45.565
I thought the barn was on fire.

48:45.589 --> 48:47.549
I almost called the
fire department.

48:50.802 --> 48:52.637
What are you doing?

48:52.638 --> 48:55.658
You are an Englisher.

48:55.682 --> 48:58.119
- You would not
understand.- You know what?

48:58.143 --> 49:00.979
You say that a lot, like
it explains something.

49:02.856 --> 49:04.918
A long time ago,

49:04.942 --> 49:09.047
people used to look
up at the night sky.

49:09.071 --> 49:14.093
They would see shapes of strange
creatures and great men,

49:14.117 --> 49:17.204
and they thought
they lived up there.

49:19.498 --> 49:21.332
What do you think, Grace?

49:21.333 --> 49:23.353
Is that possible?

49:23.377 --> 49:25.002
I think they were myths.

49:25.003 --> 49:27.923
Because we know better now.

49:30.008 --> 49:35.305
In my church, we
count our blessings.

49:37.015 --> 49:40.536
Shouldn't knowledge
be a blessing, too?

49:40.560 --> 49:43.605
Yeah. Is that what... is
that what you believe?

49:48.735 --> 49:52.965
I started to read with
Elizabeth after my father died

49:52.989 --> 49:54.634
and my mother remarried.

49:54.658 --> 50:00.538
She opened my eyes to
a whole new world.

50:00.539 --> 50:04.542
But for Abraham...

50:04.543 --> 50:06.043
there could be no other world.

50:06.044 --> 50:09.315
He was a good man...

50:09.339 --> 50:12.819
Very strict.

50:12.843 --> 50:17.388
And then Elizabeth
gave me my first book.

50:17.389 --> 50:20.660
I ran home to show my mother.

50:20.684 --> 50:24.021
When Abraham saw
it, he burned it.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.626
He burned it?

50:28.650 --> 50:31.129
- That's terrible.-
He was protecting me.

50:31.153 --> 50:36.509
- You love these books,
Levi.- We have rules, Grace.

50:36.533 --> 50:40.179
If I don't accept them,

50:40.203 --> 50:44.124
I will be banned by the church.
I will be shunned.

50:46.918 --> 50:50.672
Levi, let me keep
the books for you.

50:51.757 --> 50:53.550
Give them to someone
that will love them.

51:29.085 --> 51:31.963
- There they are!- Nana! Levi!

51:33.590 --> 51:35.526
It will be good for your kinder

51:35.550 --> 51:37.528
to be home again
where they belong.

51:37.552 --> 51:40.388
Claire: And for you
to return to yours.

51:43.850 --> 51:46.287
Rose: Henry tells
me that the cousins

51:46.311 --> 51:48.479
played and worked well together.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.082
- This is good.- Mm-hmm.

51:50.106 --> 51:52.108
Who knows when they will
see each other again?

51:56.863 --> 51:58.114
It's okay.

52:10.001 --> 52:11.771
Zillah, what is this?

52:11.795 --> 52:13.314
I want to go home, too.

52:13.338 --> 52:15.399
Already?

52:15.423 --> 52:17.110
We can drop you on our way.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.261
I cannot go with you.

52:21.763 --> 52:24.266
Levi, will you drive me?

52:57.632 --> 52:59.527
Your mother is feeling better?

52:59.551 --> 53:02.029
Much better. Thank you.

53:02.053 --> 53:05.181
Her sister is gone, hmm?
And the Englisher?

53:07.058 --> 53:09.727
You must see to
your family, Levi,

53:09.728 --> 53:12.062
and not look to outsiders.

53:12.063 --> 53:15.168
Perhaps he does not have enough
time to take care of his family

53:15.192 --> 53:17.611
because he's too busy
reading his books.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.798
Is this true?

53:20.822 --> 53:24.260
I have no books
except the Bible.

53:24.284 --> 53:26.410
I have seen them, Father.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.579
He has them in a secret
room in the barn,

53:28.580 --> 53:30.600
books and all sorts of things.

53:30.624 --> 53:33.227
Levi, tell me the truth.

53:33.251 --> 53:36.397
Did my daughter
see these things?

53:36.421 --> 53:40.591
Yes, but I got rid of them
after Zillah reminded me

53:40.592 --> 53:43.404
how wrong it was
to own such books.

53:43.428 --> 53:45.406
You should know right from wrong

53:45.430 --> 53:47.950
without the help of
my daughter, Levi.

53:47.974 --> 53:50.119
I am very sorry, Bishop.

53:50.143 --> 53:52.622
You have confessed your sin

53:52.646 --> 53:54.707
and rid yourself of
the evil things.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.941
We will speak of it no more.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.985
Thank you, Bishop.

54:00.612 --> 54:04.491
Come along, Zillah. Your mother
will be glad of your help.

54:09.037 --> 54:10.205
Levi!

54:13.166 --> 54:16.437
Was ist das?

54:16.461 --> 54:18.129
A telephone?

54:19.005 --> 54:22.800
- Is this yours?- Yes.

54:22.801 --> 54:26.530
What are you doing with this
forbidden instrument on your person?

54:26.554 --> 54:30.242
In case of an emergency like the
day my stepfather was killed.

54:30.266 --> 54:32.810
Do you have so little faith

54:32.811 --> 54:36.582
you think God is not able to
take care of such emergencies?

54:36.606 --> 54:40.044
I prayed to God that day, Bishop.
I prayed for my mother.

54:40.068 --> 54:42.213
All I know is that
without Grace Conner,

54:42.237 --> 54:45.633
I would have lost my mother
and baby brother, too.

54:45.657 --> 54:50.805
No. No, this is too much.
You must repent!

54:50.829 --> 54:54.267
I will expect your confession
before the congregation on Sunday,

54:54.291 --> 55:00.755
and you will destroy
this thing immediately.

55:28.742 --> 55:33.556
Excuse me? How did
you get over here?

55:33.580 --> 55:35.766
All right, you know what?

55:35.790 --> 55:38.375
We will feed a stray dog,
but you gotta go back.

55:38.376 --> 55:42.422
- Sorry. Nothing personal.-

55:50.722 --> 55:52.766
That's a good girl.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.483
You're doing very good.

56:03.443 --> 56:05.904
Why do you have Jacob?

56:07.989 --> 56:10.074
Jacob?

56:10.075 --> 56:13.744
- Sarah named her.- A-ha.

56:13.745 --> 56:17.414
Well, Miss Jacob here
was in my front yard.

56:17.415 --> 56:19.894
I don't know, there must be a
break in the fence somewhere.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.564
Let's get her into the barn.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.090
Come on.

56:29.344 --> 56:34.492
- You take good care of her.-
She is God's creature.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.684
I hope she wasn't
too much trouble.

56:40.688 --> 56:44.441
You know, until
this man is caught,

56:44.442 --> 56:46.212
you shouldn't be out alone.

56:46.236 --> 56:49.256
Eh, I had a homesick
cow in my yard.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.343
Since you don't have a telephone,
I didn't have much of a choice.

56:54.035 --> 56:55.370
Grace?

56:56.621 --> 57:00.624
Sorry. It was just the...
the thunder.

57:00.625 --> 57:03.062
It's, uh... whew.

57:03.086 --> 57:06.256
- Is this from the war?- Yeah.

57:07.298 --> 57:08.442
You know, mostly I'm fine.

57:08.466 --> 57:10.194
Sometimes something
like that happens

57:10.218 --> 57:11.904
or I'll have a nightmare
or something.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.847
And you still want to go back?

57:15.306 --> 57:17.576
I know you don't understand.

57:17.600 --> 57:21.145
I miss my family, but I miss
my team over there, too.

57:21.146 --> 57:23.165
They really need me.

57:23.189 --> 57:25.482
And you?

57:25.483 --> 57:27.485
What do you need?

57:29.154 --> 57:31.072
I save lives over there.

57:32.574 --> 57:35.410
It turns out you save
lives here, too.

57:46.087 --> 57:50.675
We probably shouldn't
be like this, right?

57:53.761 --> 57:56.180
Those are my words to say.

57:56.181 --> 57:59.058
I guess.

58:04.189 --> 58:07.025
That was a gunshot. Was
that from the house?

58:12.697 --> 58:14.341
Levi: Mom!

58:14.365 --> 58:15.866
What happened? Are
you all right?

58:15.867 --> 58:19.680
We are not hurt, but only
by the grace of God.

58:19.704 --> 58:22.641
Although there's now a
hole in the kitchen floor.

58:22.665 --> 58:25.919
- What?- Tell them, Albert.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.690
I found it today.

58:29.714 --> 58:31.901
Where did you find it, Albert?

58:31.925 --> 58:35.654
I was climbing the apple
tree by the back fence.

58:35.678 --> 58:38.181
I looked down and saw
it in the weeds.

58:39.557 --> 58:43.227
- Did you think it
was a toy?- No.

58:43.228 --> 58:47.499
Then why did you bring this
thing that kills into our home?

58:47.523 --> 58:52.820
I wanted it in case the
bad man came back.

58:58.701 --> 59:00.161
Aye.

59:01.412 --> 59:04.749
It's okay. It's okay.

59:11.589 --> 59:13.025
Okay, so you stay with the gun.

59:13.049 --> 59:15.152
I'm gonna go home and
call the sheriff.

59:15.176 --> 59:17.363
I don't like you walking
alone in the storm.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.387
I'm not leaving that gun
without adult supervision,

59:19.411 --> 59:21.200
and we can't ask your
mom to oversee it,

59:21.224 --> 59:23.267
so unless you're hiding a phone

59:23.268 --> 59:24.769
somewhere in here, I gotta go.

59:30.733 --> 59:34.713
Did the boy see anybody else
around when he found it?

59:34.737 --> 59:37.031
He said it was just lying there.

59:38.366 --> 59:40.302
It's a .38,same
caliber as the gun

59:40.326 --> 59:42.996
that was used to
kill Abraham Miller.

59:46.165 --> 59:48.394
Three rounds have been fired.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.728
Counting the one that went off

59:49.752 --> 59:51.352
in the kitchen tonight,
that'd be right.

59:51.376 --> 59:53.463
Can you check it for prints?

59:53.464 --> 59:54.798
We'll run a ballistics check,

59:54.799 --> 59:56.443
but this gun has been
down in a wet field

59:56.467 --> 59:58.547
and now all these people
have put their hands on it.

59:58.571 --> 01:00:01.115
Deputy Small will drive this
over to Lexington to the lab

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.658
and we'll have our
boys check it out.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:04.660
Thank you.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.662
And, Grace, how about I
give you a ride home?

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.106
That'd be great, thanks.

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.321
Grace: Thank you for
the ride, Sheriff.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:21.593
Oh, I wanted to show you
something before you go, Grace.

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:23.804
Look familiar?

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:27.164
- Uh, no.- Owen Peterson,

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:29.351
that local boy I was
telling you about.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.854
He just got out of prison
and now he's vanished.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.439
So you still think he did it?

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.982
I don't know for sure,

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.608
but if he wasn't mixed
up in something,

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:38.277
I think he would've
turned up by now.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.177
Well, obviously, his
prints are in the system.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:42.406
- If you get a match on
the gun, then... Exactly.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.658
Meantime, you see
anybody with this mug,

01:00:44.682 --> 01:00:48.227
- you let me know.- Will do.

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.296
Hey, here, let me
get that for you.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.298
Oh, hey. Oh, thank you.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.365
- There you go.-

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.367
That's good, thanks.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:06.871
- Looks like the sun finally
decided to come out.- Yeah.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:11.208
Something tells me you
weren't just here

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:14.188
to help me with my groceries
and chat about meteorology.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.481
You got me.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.191
You actually saved me a trip.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.175
The sheriff asked me to
come down and let you know

01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:21.385
ballistics matched on the
gun found by the Amish boy.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:24.031
So it's the murder weapon.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.449
They also pulled a partial print

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.493
off one of the bullets
in the chamber.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.059
Did the sheriff mention
anything to you

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.061
about this fella Owen Peterson?

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:32.081
Did you find him?

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.875
No, but he's around.

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.293
How do you know?

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:37.878
Turns out he's been
writing letters

01:01:37.902 --> 01:01:39.422
to a bunch of folks
down at the church,

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.298
some kind of program for...

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:42.591
Yeah, the prison ministry.

01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:44.255
- Yeah, that's the
one.- Yeah, I know it.

01:01:44.279 --> 01:01:46.053
Yeah, Peterson's been
writing these letters,

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:49.014
talking about how he can't
wait to have a fresh start.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.892
This fella Peterson,
if he is the killer,

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:54.251
good chance he's gonna
stick around here

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:57.022
and try to get as much money
together before he skips town.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:02:00.924
Do you think that he's the one
that stole my grandma's things?

01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:05.346
Hard to say. Yeah, hard to say.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:07.807
Well...

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:28.011
I'm cold.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:32.248
Keep her warm, Albert.
We'll be home soon.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.521
There's the Conner's driveway.

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:40.190
You see? Almost there.

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:41.966
Hyah!

01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:56.540
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:57.607
Whoa.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:03.654
Take the reins, Albert.
Wait here.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:07.325
Grace?

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.494
Grace?

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.580
Grace.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.638
I thought I heard
you moving around.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.348
How you feeling, honey?

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.644
Mm. I'm okay, Grandma.

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:39.416
Grace, you gave us quite
a scare last night.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.192
Yeah, well, nothing's broken.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:47.030
Just a few bumps and bruises.
I'll be okay.

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:49.134
It was Levi's buggy, wasn't it?

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:52.369
He was taking Sarah
and Albert home.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.223
He had the children with him?

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:57.518
It's okay. Nobody was
hurt, thanks to you.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:04:00.043
Oh, my...

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:02.045
I... I couldn't even see him.

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:03.482
Why doesn't he have
any reflectors?

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.383
Swartzentrubers don't use them.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.570
Believe it or not, they
consider them too decorative.

01:04:08.594 --> 01:04:11.657
Decor... that is
completely ridiculous.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.575
Well, you can tell him yourself.

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.662
Yeah, well, I will,
next time I see him.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.122
He's here.

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:20.898
He has been all night.

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.077
- Hey.- Grace.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:38.141
You are well.

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:40.543
- Yeah.- That is good.

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:43.647
I will get the horses

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:45.315
and I will pull your
car out of the ditch,

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:47.192
and then I will fix the fence.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:50.594
That way the cows, they won't
bother you anymore and...

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:51.887
How are Albert and Sarah?

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:54.992
They were frightened.

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:57.703
I'm sure. I'm so sorry.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.914
- It's not your fault.-
Levi, I don't understand.

01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:02.958
Why don't you have
reflectors on that thing?

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:05.275
You don't want to drive a car
or have electricity, fine.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.110
But reflectors?

01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:09.256
You're putting those
children in danger,

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.674
and I know how much
you love them.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.909
'Tis not my place
to question this.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.474
I saw the car coming last night.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:21.101
It was coming so fast.

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:23.460
I knew that you
couldn't stop in time.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:26.339
All that I could think
about was die kinder.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.345
I'm questioning many things.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.144
What is to becomeof us, Grace?

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:50.547
- What do you mean?- I...

01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:52.949
I care for you so much.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:59.348
But it would meanl
leave the church.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.958
No, Levi. I would never
let you do that.

01:06:03.709 --> 01:06:06.021
I would never let you
choose me over your family.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:08.005
But you care for me.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:11.592
Yes.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.697
Now that we know this...

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:19.701
No, now that we know this,
you need to go home, Levi,

01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:23.104
and I need to re-enlistand
go back to Afghanistan.

01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:33.030
Good morning, Bishop.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.539
Good morning, Bishop.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.226
Zillah.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.937
I need to speak with you, Levi.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:50.148
You and Zillah are to be
wed in two week's time.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.358
What?

01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:53.717
We make the
announcement on Sunday.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.655
No, Bishop, I...

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.824
I do not want tomarry
your daughter.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.159
You should have thought
of that before.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.661
Before what?

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.997
She has already told
me what happened.

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:08.250
The two of you bundled
one night she was here.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:12.235
Bundled? That's not true.
Zillah!

01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:14.214
Tell him the truth.

01:07:14.238 --> 01:07:15.966
Oh, Levi, please don't
abandon me now.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.034
Not after all the things
that you said that night.

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:22.078
Bishop, your daughter is
not telling the truth.

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:25.081
I know for a fact she
speaks the truth.

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:27.310
You told me yourself.

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:29.146
You said your rid
yourself of those books

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.421
after she came to your
room in the barn.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.733
You cannot deny it.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:35.258
She came to my room
in the barn, yes.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:37.427
She wanted to, yes.
But I never...

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:41.533
I will now allow my
daughter to be disgraced.

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:44.077
I have had my eye on you for
some time, Levi Troyer.

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:46.747
I have seen how
restless you are.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:50.751
Do you think the church will take
your word over my daughter's?

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:53.336
I do not know what the
church will believe,

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.213
but I know the truth,

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:58.281
and the truth is I
did not do this!

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:01.386
You must pray, Levi,

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:04.287
pray that God will reconcile you
to being a faithful husband

01:08:04.288 --> 01:08:06.956
to the innocent girl against
whom you have sinned.

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:09.603
I will pray, Bishop.

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:13.648
I will pray that Zillah will come
forward and make this right.

01:08:13.672 --> 01:08:16.777
You will confess your sin,

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:19.154
or you will be
putunder the Meidung.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.781
You will be shunned.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:24.493
I will not confess to a
sin I did not commit.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:27.662
Two weeks, Levi! Two weeks!

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:31.314
And you will confess! And
you will be married!

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:39.656
I can't tell you how glad I am

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:42.385
to come to town and not
have to see a doctor.

01:08:42.408 --> 01:08:44.513
Just don't overdo it.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.830
Well, I could say
the same about you.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.475
Oh, I'm fine.

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:50.960
I just got a lot on my mind.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:59.778
Are those your
grandfather's lures?

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.845
Come here for a second, Grandma.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.995
- Hey, there.- Can I help you?

01:09:09.019 --> 01:09:11.379
Yeah, I'm wondering about those
fishing lures in the window.

01:09:11.403 --> 01:09:13.542
- They look pretty old.-
They're antiques.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.335
The young woman who
brought them in

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.420
said they belonged
to her grandfather.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:19.965
She seemed quite upset,

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:22.532
but she said she needed
the money, so...

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:24.301
Would you like to see them?

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:29.558
Actually, do you have any
antique mirrors about so big?

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:33.185
It's funny you should
ask about a mirror.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:38.548
That same young woman brought
one in just a few days later.

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.676
I think you're gonna like it.

01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:43.595
Something like that?

01:09:45.805 --> 01:09:47.600
Oh.

01:09:51.522 --> 01:09:53.242
Voicemail: Hi, it's Becky.
Leave a message.

01:09:53.265 --> 01:09:55.208
I'll get back to you. Thanks.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:56.835
Becky, it's me. Where are you?

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.299
I know you're getting
these messages.

01:09:58.323 --> 01:09:59.908
Call me back right away.

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:21.090
I did not do these things
that Zillah accuses me of.

01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:23.403
Please believe me.

01:10:23.427 --> 01:10:27.949
I do believe you,
but the Meidung...

01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:29.784
If you are put under the ban,

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:31.434
the rest of us have no choice

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:33.121
but to observe the
bishop's decision.

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:34.748
I know.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:38.627
- Even you.- How can
I abandon my own?

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.962
But how can I
ignore the Meidung?

01:10:40.986 --> 01:10:43.048
If I am shunned, I
will not be allowed

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.633
to take the children to church.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:47.093
My friends will not speak to me,

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:48.451
they will not buy our crops

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:50.680
or the baskets we
take to market.

01:10:50.704 --> 01:10:52.474
How can I feed your
brother and sister

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.434
without the money we make?

01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:57.228
We must have faith that
the truth will come out.

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.689
And if it does not?

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:02.299
Then you must obey the Meidung.

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:07.096
You must shun me.

01:11:37.295 --> 01:11:39.335
Grace: Yeah, hi. Deputy
Small, this is Grace Conner.

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:41.982
I'm looking for the sheriff.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:45.527
Okay, well do you have any
idea when he'll be back?

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:50.365
Can you just tell him that I think
he was right about Owen Peterson

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:53.702
and that I really need him to come
out here as soon as possible?

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:57.520
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:59.481
What is it that you're
not telling me?

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.694
Do you remember those letters

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:06.423
that Becky was writing
through the ministry?

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:09.884
Well, they were going to an
inmate named Owen Peterson.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.929
Pretty soon they were writing back
an forth directly to one another,

01:12:12.953 --> 01:12:15.473
and this is actually from him.
Listen to this.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.497
"I just found out that
they're releasing me early."

01:12:17.521 --> 01:12:19.602
When I get out, we'll
finally meet face-to-face.

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:21.670
"I can't wait to see
you, sweet Becky."

01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:24.941
And apparently
Peterson was released

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:26.445
just before the Millers
were attacked,

01:12:26.469 --> 01:12:27.736
and the sheriff thinks

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.195
that he was in the
area at the time.

01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:31.322
And then on top of that,
Deputy Small told me

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.033
that they found
Peterson's fingerprint

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.337
on one of the bullets in the gun

01:12:34.361 --> 01:12:36.077
that was used to kill Abraham.

01:12:36.101 --> 01:12:37.620
Even if Becky was helping him,

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:40.165
after she heard that he'd
shot Abraham and Claire...

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.250
You'd think she'd tell us,
unless he threatened her.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:45.879
Do you think he got her to
sell the lures and the mirror?

01:12:45.903 --> 01:12:47.423
I don't know, but I
just want her home

01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:49.407
so that we can help
her out of this mess.

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.576
This is my fault.

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:55.057
I should've been here.
She needed me.

01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:57.307
Oh, no, Grace. Please, no.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.600
Grandma, I want you to
go over to the Miller's

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.101
and stay with Levi and Claire

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.770
until I get all
this settled here.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:04.439
No. I'm not leaving
you here alone.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:06.131
Hey, that's an order.

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.627
Becky! Becky, are you home?

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:10.863
- Becky?- Grace.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.593
Okay, Becky, you need to come
here right now, quickly.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.138
Grace, no. I'm helping Owen
get out of here right now.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.681
Owen is not who you think he is.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:20.974
He has done terrible things.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.725
I swear I didn't do anything.

01:14:22.749 --> 01:14:25.437
- Don't... Owen didn't
attack the Millers.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.503
Honey, his fingerprints
were on the bullet, okay?

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:30.144
I talked to Deputy Small. The sheriff
is on his way here right now.

01:14:30.168 --> 01:14:33.342
- You told Deputy
Small?-Of course I did.

01:14:33.343 --> 01:14:35.113
He's dirty, Grace.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.680
He's a drug dealer
and a blackmailer.

01:14:37.681 --> 01:14:39.481
Owen was working for him
when he got arrested.

01:14:39.505 --> 01:14:42.120
You dealt drugs for Small?

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.622
I did.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:47.375
I was an addict, but Becky's
letters helped me change.

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:48.960
I'm all done with that.

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.379
She helped me on the inside,

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:54.132
and now she's still helping me.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:57.010
But your fingerprints
were on the bullet.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.868
Small is lying.

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.097
He was waiting for
Owen when he got out,

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:02.881
told him that he had to
keep working for him,

01:15:02.905 --> 01:15:05.226
said that Owen owed him $10,000.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.604
Owen didn't have that kind of
money, so I had to help him.

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:09.814
Is that why you were
selling Grandma's things?

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.691
I'm sorry, Grace. I had to.

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:15.820
Small said that if he didn't get his
money, he was gonna hurt Grandma.

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:18.125
After what happened at the
Miller's, I knew that he would.

01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:19.824
Small: And you were right.

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:23.161
To be honest, it was
never my intention.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:26.729
I didn't expect the old
Amish manto jump me.

01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.732
But since you made it so clear
that Owen here is done selling,

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:31.920
there's nothing that
would make me happier

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.422
than to pin a murder
or three on him.

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:37.550
Leave us alone. We
already paid you.

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:41.387
I'm afraid money is no longer
the issue here, kiddo,

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:43.890
not since your sister decided
to get in the middle of it.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.934
Now it's nothing personal,

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.603
just not a big fan of witnesses.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:50.563
You can't kill all three of us.

01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:51.907
It would be impossible
to explain.

01:15:51.931 --> 01:15:55.109
Oh, is it? How about this?

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:58.780
I got your call, so I
drove out to investigate.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.907
I heard shots, and I
came in and found

01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:03.392
that Owen had shot you
two ladies with this.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.478
Look familiar, Owen?

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.374
No? It should.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.959
It's registered in your name.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:13.002
Then he pointed his gun at me

01:16:13.026 --> 01:16:15.988
and I shot him with
my service pistol.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.759
How's that sound?

01:16:19.783 --> 01:16:22.244
Sounds like I chose a good
time to come for a visit.

01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:26.248
- Whoa.- Levi!

01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:52.649
Don't move! Don't move.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.571
Trust me, I know how
to use this thing.

01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:02.826
Roll over. Roll over!

01:17:06.663 --> 01:17:07.748
You guys all right?

01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:12.836
It's over, okay?

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:36.377
You're gonna need a sling
for that shoulder.

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:38.528
I'll be okay.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:43.950
I, uh, have to take Becky
downtown to make a statement.

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:49.581
What are you thinking?

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:56.439
I'm thinking I'm not a
very good Swartzentruber,

01:17:56.463 --> 01:18:00.216
but I've known this
for some time now.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:03.404
Levi, you are a good man.

01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:06.515
Ah, but I have rebelled
against many of our rules.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:10.703
When the man who killed
Abraham was threatening me,

01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:14.207
my heart was not
full of forgiveness.

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:19.587
I understand now why Abraham fought
to save the life of my mother.

01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:21.589
Even though this is not our way,

01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:26.702
I must fight to protect
the lives of my family.

01:18:28.745 --> 01:18:32.541
And I've got feelings
for an Englisher.

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:40.692
I... I do love the
people of my church,

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.427
but I can no longer
follow their rules.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.489
So you're leaving the church?

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:49.200
Mmm. I am.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:51.560
And your family?

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:54.146
I don't know.

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:58.942
I don't know.

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:06.992
- Here you go.- Thank you.

01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:15.059
Becky and I had a long
talk this afternoon.

01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:18.146
- Good.- About you.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:22.275
- Oh.- We wanna tell
you how we feel.

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:24.152
Elizabeth: When you
joined the Army,

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.821
your parents didn't
try to stop you,

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:28.614
and neither did I.

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:30.741
I think we all
kind of understood

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:33.453
that you were looking
for something,

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:36.205
something that you didn't
think you could find here.

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:38.583
Grandma, I...

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.460
I know you have to
answer that email.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.986
Before you make a decision,

01:19:43.987 --> 01:19:48.050
I'd like you to
consider that maybe

01:19:48.074 --> 01:19:52.013
whatever you're looking for

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:54.830
could be right here
in front of you.

01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:58.936
What Grandma is trying to say

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.897
is that she wants you to stay,

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.483
and I want you to stay,

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:06.402
and Dusty wants you to stay.

01:20:06.426 --> 01:20:09.030
So, it's settled.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:11.199
So I don't get a vote? Nothing?

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:13.659
Sure, but it would
be three to one,

01:20:13.683 --> 01:20:16.186
so it wouldn't matter.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:19.814
Okay.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.450
Grace.

01:20:54.474 --> 01:20:58.079
I, uh, thought you
might like these back.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:03.483
Oh, thank you.
Over there's fine.

01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:07.880
That's a nice sling
you got there.

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:09.465
You know, maybe some day

01:21:09.489 --> 01:21:12.868
I will grow to
appreciate your sarcasm.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:16.872
I got you a present.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:19.499
Ready?

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:22.395
What is this?

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:24.063
It's a library card.

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:27.858
I really can't wait to take
you there someday soon.

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.009
They have a lot of books.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.305
- Thank you.- You're welcome.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:38.934
So I saw Bishop
Weaver and Zillah.

01:21:38.935 --> 01:21:40.436
They were leaving.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:44.273
Oh, Zillah came to admit
that she made up her story.

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:49.111
She's just jealous and
she made a mistake.

01:21:49.112 --> 01:21:50.798
So what happens?
Will she be shunned?

01:21:50.822 --> 01:21:53.616
No. She's the bishop'sdaughter.

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:56.178
She will confess in church,
and she will be forgiven,

01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:59.599
and life will go on.

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:02.226
That's ironic, isn't it?

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.959
And you, Levi?

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.462
What about you and your family?

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.774
Well, my family decided
to changeto a new order.

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:12.069
They're going to join my Aunt
Rose and my Uncle Henry.

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:15.281
- And you... No.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:18.075
But the rules in the new
church allow for contact

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:21.770
with those of different
faiths, so it's good.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:26.816
It's the right decision
for all of us.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.488
I made a decision, too,
about re-enlisting.

01:22:32.489 --> 01:22:34.824
Yeah?

01:22:36.534 --> 01:22:41.349
So, Dr. Allen offered me a
position at the hospital

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:43.792
and I think you might
be stuck with me.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.646
- That is good.- Really?

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:48.837
That is very good, yes.

01:22:48.838 --> 01:22:53.152
Yeah, that's... it's a blessing
to know that you'll be nearby

01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:55.553
to help me find my way
in the English world.

01:22:58.181 --> 01:23:00.618
I do know two things.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.245
What's that?

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:06.815
I know that I love
you, Grace Conner.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:13.339
- I love you, too.- Really?

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:14.406
Yeah.

01:23:19.119 --> 01:23:20.638
Mm. Mm. Wait.

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:22.705
What's... what's
the second thing?

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:26.001
I know where to find a
book on English weddings.
