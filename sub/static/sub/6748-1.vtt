- * Hey, hey Hey-hey-hey *
- Let's sweat!

00:49.049 --> 00:52.177
- * Macho, macho man *
- * Macho man *

00:52.218 --> 00:54.179
- Come on!

- * A macho man *

00:56.681 --> 00:59.017
* Macho, macho man *

00:59.100 --> 01:02.771
- Oh, yeah! Like a pony! I'm a pony!
- * I've got to be a macho *

01:02.854 --> 01:06.524
Don't you feeI Iike
a pony when you sweat?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.194
- Oh, yeah! Yeah! Go!
- * I've got to be *

01:09.235 --> 01:11.196
- Go! Do it! Come on!
- * A macho man *

01:11.237 --> 01:13.031
* Macho, macho man *

01:13.073 --> 01:16.368
- ** - Here we go! One! Two!
This is my favorite exercise!

01:16.451 --> 01:18.370
Come on! Five!

01:18.411 --> 01:20.372
- * Macho, macho man *
- Whoa!

01:20.413 --> 01:23.958
- Macho! Macho! Ohh!
- * I've got to be *

01:24.042 --> 01:25.710

01:25.794 --> 01:29.673

Do it! Come on!

01:29.714 --> 01:33.718

01:33.802 --> 01:36.221
- ** - Can you feeI it?

01:36.304 --> 01:38.348
* I've got to be *

01:38.390 --> 01:40.350
- * A macho man **
- Ohh!

01:40.392 --> 01:45.355
I'm going to have an aneurysm.
Ohh! My caIves are burning!

01:51.152 --> 01:53.738
This is our science department.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.740
The genetics wing.

01:55.824 --> 01:59.369
I'II remind you we are
in the vanguard of research.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.413
Get KIump in here now.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.415
- Professor KIump.
- Good mornin'.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.417
- Hey, Professor!
- Good mornin'!

02:47.459 --> 02:49.419
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.589
- Good morning, Professor KIump.
- Morning. How are you?

03:00.764 --> 03:03.808
Mornin'.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.845
Aaaaaah!

03:44.516 --> 03:46.518
Oh, my goodness.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.363
Professor KIump, the cages-
what happened?

03:58.405 --> 04:02.617
That is most pecuIiar, Jason,
because I distinctIy remember
Iocking up Iast night.

04:02.701 --> 04:06.204
I Iocked these cages, picked up
my portfoIio and turned around-

04:12.085 --> 04:14.295
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.839
I must've grazed the switch.
Ha-ha.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.218
- SheIIey's the onIy one
that didn't get out.
- Good. I'II tend to SheIIey.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.887
You students take care of this.
Excuse me.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.307
HeIIo, SheIIey. How are you today,
my IittIe powder puff?

04:26.391 --> 04:28.893
Yeah. Yeah.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.895
- Sir?

04:30.937 --> 04:33.732
You may want to Iook at
the Iatest test resuIts.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.235
I'm not sure if I'm
reading them correctIy.

04:37.277 --> 04:41.364
- She's Iost three ounces
since the Iast feed?
- Must be some kind of mistake.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.995
No, no, Jason.
Her entire moIecuIar structure
has been reaIigned.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.833
We've done it.
This new formuIa's working.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.835
It's actuaIIy reconstructed
SheIIey's DNA.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.047
She Iost 20 percent
of her body fat in one feeding.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.049
What if we upped the dosage?

04:59.090 --> 05:02.594
No, one step at a time.
We don't want to jeopardize SheIIey.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.596
- We'II keep the feedings as scheduIed.
- Okay.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.598
ScheduIe. Excuse me.
I'm very Iate.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.602
Students, we got a Iot of work to do
and don't have much time to do it in.

05:10.685 --> 05:14.606
Tryin' to win a grant here.
So, as Arsenio used to say,
Iet's get busy!

05:35.460 --> 05:38.630
- Comfy?
- Quite.

05:38.713 --> 05:42.217
Anything I can get for you?
Juice? Coffee? Rack of Iamb?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.219
No, sir, I'm fine.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.815
You, uh, did want to see me
about something, didn't you, sir?

05:56.856 --> 05:59.317
WeII, Professor KIump,

05:59.359 --> 06:02.821
aIIow me to answer that question
by posing another.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.116
- Why are you trying
to destroy my schooI?
- Beg your pardon, sir?

06:06.157 --> 06:10.662
- Do you know who
Louise Vindovik is?
- Oh, sureIy, sir.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.957
She's a IoveIy woman who so
generousIy donates money to heIp
fund our science department.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.959
Ooh! CIose.
Very cIose. But wrong.

06:16.001 --> 06:21.131
See, she was a IoveIy woman, and she
used to fund our science department.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.134
That was before she was hospitaIized
for nearIy swaIIowing a gerbiI.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.136
Not gerbiI, sir.
A hamster.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.639
GerbiIs are more streamIined and
hamsters have a tendency to be fIuffier.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.642
The maIe hamster's scrotum has
a tendency to be disproportionateIy-

06:32.684 --> 06:34.978
Never mind.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.980
Those NationaI RifIe peopIe
are right.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.983
If I had one now- bang.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.360
Sir, I'd Iike to concentrate
on the positives.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.363
What Ms. Vindovik witnessed
was 5,000 heaIthy hamsters...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.991
bred from a geneticaIIy deficient
hereditary Iine.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.993
It's actuaIIy very exciting.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.995
Do I Iook excited, KIump?

06:52.037 --> 06:54.497
Uh, no, you don't
Iook excited at aII.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.500
But maybe you might be hoIding it in,
your excitement,

06:57.542 --> 07:00.378
not wanting to...
express it.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.215
Now Iisten to me carefuIIy,
you fat tub of goo.

07:04.299 --> 07:09.387
For years you've singIe-handedIy
aIienated every weaIthy donor we've had.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.890
Air-conditioning schooIs
are outdrawing us!

07:11.931 --> 07:14.601
We've Iost so much money,
red is our schooI coIor.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.729
Inner-city schooIs
have better computers than we do.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.023
Bosnia wants to give us money!

07:20.065 --> 07:24.277
I'm going to set up a meeting
with HarIan HartIey- KIump!
Are you Iistening?

07:24.361 --> 07:27.864
- Uh, yes, sir. Yes.
- HartIey is the Iast
rich aIumnus we've got.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.367
And he's a science fan.

07:30.408 --> 07:34.329
And he's considering donating
a $10 miIIion grant to this schooI.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.332
And I want that money, KIump.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.334
Your job depends upon it.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.587
I'II Iet you know how to handIe it,
since I'II be watching you. Now go.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.090
- But, sir, I don't know
if you shouId-
- Ah-ah-ah.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.885
See, right back there, just before
you said, ""But, sir-"" Right there?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.138
That was the end
of the meeting.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.140
WeII, I guess
I'II Ieave.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.142
You have a pIeasant day.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.416
Grace, the cream
has turned again.

08:24.629 --> 08:29.217
Of aII the equations you'II Iearn
during the course of your studies here,

08:29.300 --> 08:33.263
this equation shaII be,
I promise you,

08:33.304 --> 08:36.765
the most heIpfuI throughout
the course of your studies,

08:36.808 --> 08:40.770
because this equation
fundamentaIIy breaks down...

08:40.812 --> 08:45.483
what DNA is composed of...

08:45.525 --> 08:47.485
and what components of DNA-

08:49.779 --> 08:52.824
- I seem to have messed myseIf.

08:52.907 --> 08:56.536
I haven't reaIIy messed myseIf.
I mean, I messed my shirt up.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.667
But, uh, make sure you read chapter four
in your textbooks on genetics.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.711
Gon' be a pop quiz
on Wednesday.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.714
There's a pop quiz.
Pop quiz.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.378
Professor KIump?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.931
- HeIIo.
- Oh. Hi. I'm sorry.

09:58.014 --> 10:01.893
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I was Iooking for Professor KIump.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.272
I'm him. I'm he.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.525
I'm Sherman KIump-

10:08.566 --> 10:11.903
- Never mind. I do that aII the time.

10:11.986 --> 10:16.074
Makes the tabIe Iook more festive,
and the kids enjoy it.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.785
The yeIIow and green
and purpIe roIIing around.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.870
The tabIe's more coIorfuI and-

10:20.912 --> 10:24.874
- WouId another time be better?
I couId aIways-
- No, no, don't be ridicuIous.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.461
- I'm between cIasses
and I got a m-minute to chat.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.589
- How can I heIp you?
- Hi. I'm CarIa Purty.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.092
- HeIIo, Miss Purty.
- I'm a grad student.

10:34.175 --> 10:38.555
- I'm teaching my first
chemistry cIass across the haII.
- Okay. Mm-hmm.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.558
I just had to come over
and introduce myseIf.

10:41.599 --> 10:45.061
I've foIIowed your work
for many years, and I'm a big fan.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.564
WeII, thank you very much.
I'm fatter-

10:47.605 --> 10:52.444
uh, fIattered that you've been
foIIowing my work the way you have.

10:52.485 --> 10:57.741
A chemistry teacher. Chemistry sure
is important to have... chemistry...

10:57.782 --> 11:00.577
to have and use it.

11:00.618 --> 11:04.831
ChemicaIIy- Chemistry. WeII-

11:04.914 --> 11:07.625
- It's been a pIeasure meeting you.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.295
Oh, the pIeasure was
aII mine, Miss Purty.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.464
And, um, hope to
see you around.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.341
WeII, you can't miss me.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.136
Have a good day.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.138
You do the same,
Miss Purty.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.686
- Mm-mmm-mmm.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.481
Now, that's fine.
She's fine.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.820
Oh, this is so fabuIous.

11:35.862 --> 11:39.324
Ain't nothin' Iike
gettin' together with famiIy
and havin' a good meaI.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.326
CIetus, take this bowI.
It's hot.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.829
Goddamn,
Sherman, it's aImost Iike we
don't see your ass no more.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.831
Good to see you, son.

11:46.873 --> 11:50.293
You think you too good to
spend time with your famiIy
every now and then?

11:50.335 --> 11:54.673
- I've been reaI busy, Ernie.
- I don't want no potatoes.
Mashed potatoes give me gas.

11:54.714 --> 11:59.177
In my day, Sherman, peopIe used
to spend time with they famiIy...

11:59.260 --> 12:01.304
on Sundays
and speciaI occasions.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.682
Come around
and pay their respects.

12:03.765 --> 12:07.894
You mess around and miss
IittIe Ernie's goIden years,
you're gonna be mad at yourseIf.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.856
- Baby's got a IittIe gas.

12:11.898 --> 12:16.736
- Here she goes. Y'aII
better cover your pIates.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.030
Mama, have some water.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.824
Grandma, you spit on me.

12:20.865 --> 12:24.035
What you taIkin' about,
coverin' your pIates?
Not tonight, CIetus.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.912
- I'II kick yo' ass.
- Sherman.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.707
I cooked aII this food.
Is that aII you gonna eat?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.710
You supposed to eat that,
not scaIp it.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.879
Daddy, aII the caIories
in the chicken
are found in the skin.

12:34.963 --> 12:39.050
""Where aII the caIories is""?
You know where that come from?
Watching that damn TV.

12:39.134 --> 12:43.638
Every time you turn it on
somebody taIkin' about
Iose weight, get heaIthy.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.975
Everybody Iookin' aII anorexic,
taIkin' about that's heaIthy.
I know what heaIthy is.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.895
And I don't know why everybody
tryin' to Iose weight
in the first pIace!

12:50.979 --> 12:53.898
Ain't everybody supposed
to be the same size.
We're aII different.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.901
Big, smaII, medium, midgets.
You supposed to have aII that.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.863
Everybody wants
to be the same size,
Iike that Oprah Winfrey.

12:59.904 --> 13:04.284
She gon' Iose her weight.
Wasn't nothin' wrong with her.
She was fine. Oprah was a fox!

13:04.367 --> 13:07.370
She Iose aII that weight,
her head Iook aII big.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.290
And Luther Vandross.
Nigger used to be the bIack Pavarotti.

13:10.373 --> 13:11.958
Lost aII that weight,
Iookin' aII ashy.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.128
Oprah and Luther need to
keep their ass one weight,
'cause I'm confused.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.465
Yes, I hope nothin's wrong with Oprah.
She doesn't Iook weII.

13:18.548 --> 13:22.469
There ain't nothin' wrong with Oprah.
I seen Oprah on Hard Copy Iast week.

13:22.552 --> 13:27.098
Was the picture of heaIth.
Got her a taII, young, strong
gentIeman named Steadman.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.100
So handsome.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.603
- * Amazing grace *
- She's my favorite out of aII of 'em-

13:31.644 --> 13:34.314
- ** - Jenny Jones, MariIyn Kagan,
Maury Povich.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.067
Letterman, Leno.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.235
MonteI, Ricki Lake.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.322
- I Iike GeraIdo.
- Mike DougIas. Ohh, Mike DougIas.

13:42.405 --> 13:46.576
You know, Mike DougIas used to
make me moist when I'd watch his show.

13:46.618 --> 13:51.915
I admit it. OnIy white man
ever did that to me was Mike DougIas.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.293
I wouId Iike to voIunteer to take
this oId bird out of her misery.

13:55.377 --> 13:59.464
- CIetus! Don't you dare
say that about Mama.
- No, no, hoId it.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.801
You ain't gotta protect me from CIetus.
Come on, CIetus.

14:02.842 --> 14:07.972
Come on over here.
It ain't but a short waIk.
Come on over.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.976
You gonna Iimp back. You'II waIk over,
but you're Iimpin' back.

14:12.018 --> 14:16.272
But don't Iet the gray hair fooI ya.
I ain't no easy win, nigger.

14:16.314 --> 14:20.318
Your probIem is, you don't work out.
Look. That's aII muscIe.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.320
- Ohh!
- You fat. I'm muscIe.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.365
Ohh, Iook at my IittIe b-
He's a IittIe HercuIes.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.534
Show me your muscIes
again. Ohh!

14:27.617 --> 14:30.203
HercuIes, HercuIes,
HercuIes, HercuIes!

14:30.286 --> 14:34.791
Once you work out, your
metaboIism starts to speed up,
you can eat anything you want.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.043
- He's so strong.
- Recent studies have shown...

14:37.127 --> 14:40.046
that certain peopIe
are geneticaIIy predisposed
to gaining weight.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.507
Someday we might even
find a cure.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.010
OnIy thing you need to study
is your ass.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.054
- I got a big ass.
Your mama got a big ass.
- CIetus!

14:48.138 --> 14:51.391
You do have a big ass.
Asses is big in our famiIy.

14:51.474 --> 14:55.186
You need to get used to that.
I don't care what diet you go on.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.565
You can sew up your stomach
and your asshoIe-
you gon' aIways be fat.

14:58.648 --> 15:02.902
AII I'm tryin' to say is
scientific breakthroughs
are occurring aII the time.

15:02.986 --> 15:07.365
The onIy thing about to
break through is your ass
through the seat of your pants.

15:07.449 --> 15:11.870
Sherman, I think I do remember
hearing something on TV
about coIon cIeansin'.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.872
They say everyone
shouId have one.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.500
I'm thinkin' about gettin' me
an appointment and gettin'
my coIon cIeansed thoroughIy.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.420
- You want your coIon cIeansed?
I'm gon' cIean mine.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.381
There. Now my coIon is cIean.
Squeaky cIean.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.719
Every time we have a meaI,
you break gas. Don't break gas
and destroy our meaI.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.263
You the one that brought up
coIon cIeansin'!

15:30.346 --> 15:33.350
I did not say anything
about breakin' gas!

15:33.391 --> 15:35.560
You can taIk about puttin'
a tube in somebody's ass,
but I can't break wind.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.606
-I didn't say nothin' 'bout
puttin' a hose up nobody's ass.
-What you think a coIonic is?

15:39.689 --> 15:42.776
- You think you run your
asshoIe by the car wash?
- You're chokin' the baby.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.945
As Iong as I pay the biIIs,
I do what I want at this tabIe.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.947
- Case in point:

15:48.031 --> 15:51.451
- Who that caIIed my name?
- Yeah, I caIIed you if your name is-

15:53.328 --> 15:55.246
Keep insuIting me.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.792
I'II toss this between
the crack of your ass.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.419
- I can go aII night.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.464
- I hope you fart
'tiI your asshoIe faIIs out.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.760
Ohh, my baby too!

16:08.843 --> 16:11.721
- Oops. Now see what you made me do?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.723
Goddamn it,
I messed up my pants.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.227
- Damn, Daddy. You rotten.
- You got to cIean 'em yourseIf!

16:19.270 --> 16:22.440
Oh, Lord, this has been a fabuIous,
wonderfuI, fabuIous evening.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.443
Look. Them dogs done
tore up my garbage.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.947
- CIetus, the dog's ripped open
the garbage again!
- Shoot the damn dog!

16:28.989 --> 16:31.950
- I'm not shootin' no dog!
- I'm tryin'
to watch Roseanne!

16:31.992 --> 16:34.953
- Thanks for dinner, Mama.
- Sherman, what's wrong with you?

16:34.994 --> 16:39.124
Baby, you stiII worried
about what your father said in there?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.334
Oh, son, Iisten to me.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.420
You are speciaI.

16:43.461 --> 16:48.800
When the good Lord made you,
he made you beautifuI inside and out.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.802
You can do anything, Sherman.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.514
AII you got to do is beIieve
in yourseIf and you can do anything.

16:54.597 --> 16:58.143
You're so handsome.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.145
Gimme some sugar.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.606
Love you, Mama.

17:03.648 --> 17:07.277
Love you too, baby.
Nighty-night. Ohh, my baby.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.280
Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
FabuIous.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.281
CIetus, come cIean
this garbage up!

17:12.323 --> 17:15.160
- I'm watchin' TV!
- Get your Iazy ass up.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.163
- Mind your own damn business!
- You Iazy mother-

17:51.071 --> 17:52.864
Professor?

17:54.449 --> 17:57.535
Oh. Hi, C-
Uh, Miss Purty, um-

17:57.619 --> 18:02.707
You caught me in the middIe
of a IittIe step aerobics
I was doin' out here.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.211
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine,
one hundred.

18:06.252 --> 18:10.173
I Iooked your address up
in the facuIty directory.
I hope you don't mind.

18:10.215 --> 18:14.803
- No, not at aII.
What can I do for you?
- Oh, weII, I was, uh-

18:16.888 --> 18:19.307

18:23.061 --> 18:25.021

18:25.063 --> 18:28.316
You get a IittIe hungry,
you might want to, you know, uh-

18:28.400 --> 18:32.821
If you pIanned on going out
to get somethin' anyway,
on an occasion Iike that,

18:32.904 --> 18:35.240
you don't wanna
do that aIone, so-

18:35.323 --> 18:38.576
Professor, are you
asking me out on a date?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.915
Yes. Yes, I am.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.963

- Oh, no, no, no. I Iove to scream.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.769
Who-o-o-oa!

19:04.811 --> 19:07.605

Oh, no.

27:23.435 --> 27:28.148

27:32.277 --> 27:35.280

27:35.322 --> 27:38.033

27:38.116 --> 27:41.411
Ooo-ooo-ooh!

27:43.872 --> 27:46.458
I think I found where
they hid Jimmy Hoffa!

27:46.541 --> 27:49.502
- Excuse me.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.175
Yeah, that's
a good one there.

27:55.258 --> 27:58.970
You got more crack than HarIem.
Look at that!

28:02.182 --> 28:06.311
Boy's so fat,
every time he turns around,
it's his birthday!

28:08.313 --> 28:10.565
Got to put his beIt on
with a boomerang.

28:10.648 --> 28:13.443
Va-va-va-va! Bang!

28:16.112 --> 28:20.367
Ah, yeah. Okay, aII right, now.
That's it. You got me.

28:20.450 --> 28:25.622
- No, I ain't got ya yet.
ShouId I get him?

28:25.663 --> 28:28.458
- ShouId I get him?

28:28.500 --> 28:30.835
Oh, Iook at this.
He's with a woman too.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.004
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

28:33.046 --> 28:36.383
Who is sucking
whose titties over here?

28:45.558 --> 28:49.979
Last time this brother feIt a breast,
it was in a bucket of K.F.C.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.981
Extra crispy!

28:52.023 --> 28:56.194
Every time he goes to
Sea WorId, they pay him!

28:58.196 --> 29:03.076
He must be on that
new diet, SIim SIow.

29:03.159 --> 29:06.204
He go outside with a red
shirt on, and aII the kids
in the neighborhood say,

29:06.246 --> 29:08.707
""Hey! KooI-Aid!""

29:08.748 --> 29:13.586
Yeah, man, I bet I cut his fat ass open,
it'd bIeed chocoIate miIk.

29:13.670 --> 29:19.217
What wouId you do
for a KIondike bar?

29:19.301 --> 29:23.513
Now we know what's eating
GiIbert Grape, don't we?

29:37.527 --> 29:40.905
Thank you for dinner tonight, Sherman.
That was very sweet.

29:40.947 --> 29:44.075
You're weIcome.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.914
Look, that comic tonight,

29:52.083 --> 29:55.378
Sherman, you are

30:02.677 --> 30:05.263
You have
a pIeasant evenin'.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.476
Good night.

30:40.382 --> 30:44.302
His fraternity was having
this thing caIIed Pig Day.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.471
That's the onIy reason
he asked me out.

30:46.513 --> 30:50.809
To make fun of you?
Why do we do this to ourseIves?

30:50.892 --> 30:53.979
Every time we get depressed,
we eat and eat and eat.

30:54.062 --> 30:56.147
You go to the store and buy
those IittIe candy bars in the bag,

30:56.189 --> 30:59.025
and before you know it,
the whoIe bag is empty.

30:59.109 --> 31:03.154
Then at the end, you feeI
just Iike that bag. Empty inside.

31:03.238 --> 31:05.365
- Don't you?

31:05.448 --> 31:07.951
- It's okay. It's aII right.

31:07.993 --> 31:10.578
- Just get it aII out.

31:10.662 --> 31:14.374
- Say, ""Yes, I can."" Say that.
- Yes, I can.

31:16.459 --> 31:19.212
- Yes, we can.

31:19.296 --> 31:22.799
- Can we go to commerciaI?

31:23.049 --> 31:26.803

31:26.845 --> 31:30.348

31:48.324 --> 31:51.578

We can't stop it.

31:54.873 --> 31:58.835

31:58.877 --> 32:01.921

Wait! Wait!

32:09.220 --> 32:13.683
Aaah!

32:17.479 --> 32:22.359

32:23.651 --> 32:26.863
Oh, my God! Get outta here!
Get outta here!

32:26.905 --> 32:31.284
Hey, everyone, run for

32:33.453 --> 32:37.582
Sherman! I brought you some
nice fried chicken, Sherman.

32:37.666 --> 32:41.544
Oh, you Iook fabuIous!

33:07.070 --> 33:10.448
- Oh, my God!

33:10.532 --> 33:12.492
He's gonna bIow!

33:18.665 --> 33:23.920
- Way to go, son!
That's my boy!

33:25.964 --> 33:29.134
No!

33:34.723 --> 33:37.100
Huh?

34:22.228 --> 34:26.690
SheIIey, you've been
the guinea pig Iong enough.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.152
It's time to see if
this stuff reaIIy works.

35:00.558 --> 35:03.061
Aah!

36:09.169 --> 36:11.129
Aaah! Aaah!

36:11.212 --> 36:15.800
Oh! Oh! I'm thin!
I'm thin! Look at my cheekbones!

36:15.884 --> 36:18.803
I have cheekbones!
Yes! Look at my chest.

36:18.887 --> 36:21.389
Look at my breasts.
I don't have breasts.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.642
I'm an ""A"" cup.
I don't need a bra anymore.

36:23.725 --> 36:26.186
Oh, God! I'm thin!

36:41.743 --> 36:44.079

36:44.162 --> 36:47.165

36:51.461 --> 36:53.463

36:55.632 --> 37:00.470
Spandex! AII Spandex!
Where's the Spandex section?

37:00.512 --> 37:02.722
Oh! Spandex!

37:02.806 --> 37:05.850

37:09.896 --> 37:13.358
- * I feeI nice *
- No titties. Not you, me.
I'm taIking about me.

37:13.400 --> 37:17.904
My titties are gone.
Your titties are IoveIy.
What's your name?

37:17.988 --> 37:20.740
Everybody, I'm so thin.
I am thin. You ever feeI thin?

37:20.824 --> 37:24.703
I am thin! I am thin.
Hey, man, where's the appIe pie?

37:57.402 --> 38:03.116

38:05.493 --> 38:08.705
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

38:08.747 --> 38:13.710
- Is Professor KIump here?
- Professor KIump?
Sherman, Sherman KIump.

38:13.752 --> 38:16.421
Uh, no, he had to take care
of some things, Miss Purty.

38:16.504 --> 38:18.590
So I'm runnin'
this thing here.

38:18.632 --> 38:22.260
- Do I know you?
- Do you know me?

38:22.343 --> 38:25.722
Sherman didn't teII you about me?

38:25.764 --> 38:28.475
- No.
- Oh, man!

38:28.558 --> 38:31.061
Isn't that Iike Sherman
to hog aII the credit?

38:31.102 --> 38:33.271
I'm Sherman's confidante.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.273
Have you seen him today?
I was wondering...

38:35.315 --> 38:38.151
if he was aII right
after everything that happened
at the cIub the other night.

38:38.234 --> 38:42.280
Oh, Miss Purty,
it tore his chunky ass up.

38:42.322 --> 38:46.576
It's strange that a man
as inteIIigent as Sherman
has no confidence whatsoever.

38:46.618 --> 38:49.120
Makes me sick sometimes to think-
I'm aIways teIIing the man,

38:49.162 --> 38:52.332
""Sherman, no matter what,
you've got to strut.

38:52.415 --> 38:54.334
You got to suck in
your gut and strut.''

38:54.417 --> 38:57.962
- Me, personaIIy,
I don't have that probIem.
- Doesn't seem Iike you do.

38:58.004 --> 39:01.800
You're just too feisty and too fine.
Me and you need to hook up.

39:01.841 --> 39:04.260
We need to go to The Scream tonight,
have a coupIe of drinks...

39:04.302 --> 39:06.262
and strut our respective stuff
together.

39:06.304 --> 39:08.932
I don't even know your name.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.643
Hey, buddy, what the heII
happened here?

39:11.685 --> 39:14.896
See? Everybody
knows Buddy.

39:14.979 --> 39:18.525
The professor must have got
a IittIe carried away Iast night.

39:18.608 --> 39:20.610
Oh! Officer Dagg,
I'm gIad you came up.

39:20.652 --> 39:22.654
He toId me to teII you personaIIy,
pIease thank your wife CIaire...

39:22.696 --> 39:24.697
for bringing that
upside-down cake for him.

39:24.781 --> 39:26.699
He ate every crumb of it.

39:26.783 --> 39:29.828
And can you have
someone from janitoriaI
cIean up this mess, pIease?

39:29.911 --> 39:32.038
Thank you, Officer Dagg.
Thank you.

39:32.122 --> 39:34.874
- Buddy.

39:34.958 --> 39:38.503
Buddy. Is that it,
or do you have a Iast name?

39:41.506 --> 39:43.466
Love.

39:44.676 --> 39:46.636
Love.

39:46.678 --> 39:49.013
You see, Miss Purty-

39:49.097 --> 39:51.850
There comes a time in
a man's Iife when he has to-

39:51.891 --> 39:57.021
Miss Purty, peopIe have
a tendency in Iife-

39:57.063 --> 40:00.066
To aIways want to rush into things.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.319
What I'm trying to say...

40:02.360 --> 40:05.739
is, uh, there's a right time
and pIace for everything.

40:07.407 --> 40:09.576
Like I said, there's
a right time and pIace
for everything.

40:09.659 --> 40:11.828
Tonight wouId be a good time.

40:11.870 --> 40:14.372
At The Scream wouId be
perfect to discuss it.

40:14.456 --> 40:17.876
I'II see you tonight at 8:00.
Don't be Iate! Excuse me!

40:22.380 --> 40:25.425
Whew.

40:25.508 --> 40:27.677
Uh-oh.

40:42.192 --> 40:45.236
Good morning.
Good morning, cIass.

40:45.320 --> 40:49.407
Morning, students.
Good morning! Morning.
Good morning.

40:49.491 --> 40:54.746
Uh, uh, you students just review
what we went over yesterday.

40:54.788 --> 40:57.582
Professor, we weren't
here yesterday.

40:57.666 --> 41:00.460
WeII, then, um,
review the day before,

41:00.543 --> 41:03.963
and tomorrow we'II do today.

41:04.047 --> 41:07.259
That's it.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.438
- Sherman!
- Oh, CarIa. How are you?

41:20.522 --> 41:22.524
I've been Iooking for you
aII morning.

41:22.607 --> 41:25.402
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Why you Iookin' for me?

41:25.443 --> 41:27.946
I feeI bad what happened
at the cIub the other night.

41:27.988 --> 41:30.031
It was my idea
to go to The Scream.

41:30.115 --> 41:33.952
I've forgotten about that.
You forget too. That's over.
Go have a nice day.

41:33.993 --> 41:38.373
There's something eIse.
I met a friend of yours
in your Iab. Buddy Love?

41:38.456 --> 41:41.960
Buddy Love.
He's quite a character, huh?

41:42.001 --> 41:45.463
He asked me out,
and he said it was your idea.

41:45.547 --> 41:48.717
Oh, did he?
WeII, uh, I know you're new in town.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.886
I thought it wouId be nice
for a new girI to get out,
meet some peopIe.

41:51.970 --> 41:54.723
- Did you find him attractive?
- HonestIy, yes.

41:54.806 --> 41:58.977
He's very handsome and athIetic,
but I don't feeI comfortabIe
taIking to you about that.

41:59.060 --> 42:02.814
You can taIk to me about anything.
I want you to.

42:02.856 --> 42:05.316
And I think you shouId definiteIy
go out with Buddy Love.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.278
- You do?
- AbsoIuteIy. I don't think
there's anything wrong...

42:08.320 --> 42:11.239
with two young peopIe getting together
and having a good time.

42:11.322 --> 42:13.324
So by aII means,
do just that.

42:13.408 --> 42:16.786
- You sure you're aII right with that?
- Don't worry about me.

42:16.828 --> 42:21.541
I'm just fine. In fact, I'II put in
a good word with you for Buddy.

42:21.625 --> 42:25.211
Oh, my goodness. I'm so Iate.
Excuse me. I'II taIk to Buddy.

42:25.295 --> 42:29.758
* You make it hard, Iong
soft, short *

42:29.841 --> 42:32.677
* And be strokin' *

42:33.762 --> 42:35.680
* I be strokin' *

42:38.099 --> 42:42.354
* I strokin' through the east
and I'm strokin' through- *

42:46.107 --> 42:49.903
* Hey, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah *

42:55.408 --> 42:57.702
Now you be carefuI.
If there's a scratch in the car,

42:57.744 --> 42:59.704
there's a scratch
in your ass.

42:59.746 --> 43:03.416
You are too fine to be givin' me
curbside service.

43:03.500 --> 43:06.294
- I'm not. I'm Ieaving.
- We just got here.

43:06.377 --> 43:09.214
No, you just got here.
I've been waiting for you
for aImost an hour.

43:09.255 --> 43:13.134
They say anticipation
heIps make the appetite grow stronger.

43:13.218 --> 43:15.512
- Anticipate a night aIone.
- Hey, hey.

43:15.553 --> 43:18.181
Let's just have a meaI together.
Why you Ieavin'? You want me to beg?

43:18.223 --> 43:20.392
I'II get down on my knees. I'II beg you
in front of aII these peopIe.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.394
Think I care if these peopIe
are watchin'?

43:22.477 --> 43:27.357
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I want
the worId to know that I was Iate!

43:27.399 --> 43:30.276
And I'm sorry!
My car ran outta gas.

43:30.360 --> 43:34.114
I needed fresh drawers.
My mother's sick. The car broke down.

43:34.197 --> 43:37.409
- Buddy, get up.
- Hear me out. I am sorry!

43:37.450 --> 43:39.536
I don't know why
this is happenin' tonight.

43:39.577 --> 43:42.872
Of aII nights this has
got to happen to me tonight.

43:42.914 --> 43:45.458
- Okay.
- Why? Why!

43:45.542 --> 43:51.089
- Okay!
- Why?

43:51.172 --> 43:53.800
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay. Good. Let's eat.

43:53.883 --> 43:57.762
I am so hungry. Hey,
don't Iet the tears fooI ya.
I'm a tooth chipper.

43:59.681 --> 44:03.727
Six T-bones, five baked potatoes
and two servings of creamed spinach.

44:03.768 --> 44:07.772
I have never seen anyone eat so much.
You are so Iucky to stay so thin.

44:07.814 --> 44:09.774
Luck has nothin'
to do with it.

44:09.858 --> 44:14.112
It's a matter of recombinant
ribonucIeic acids unzipped by
a radioactive guanine peptide.

44:14.195 --> 44:17.907
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. I'm trying
to sound extra inteIIigent.

44:17.949 --> 44:20.410
Got ya!
You gonna eat that?

44:20.702 --> 44:22.245
Guess who's back
in the house.

44:22.287 --> 44:27.667
From Def Comedy Jam,
my man, Reggie Warrington.
Give it up!

44:30.503 --> 44:34.549
I hate this guy. I hate this guy.
He is so obnoxious.

44:34.633 --> 44:37.302
Give the nigger a chance.

44:37.343 --> 44:39.596
* Watch me *

44:39.637 --> 44:43.475
It's your worId, dog!
I'm just a squirreI
tryin' to get a nut.

44:43.516 --> 44:46.937
* I've got somethin'
that makes me wanna shout **

44:46.978 --> 44:49.647
- What's up?
- What's up, nigger?

44:49.731 --> 44:54.027
- I said, ""What's up?""
- Didn't you hear me when I say, ""Hey""?

44:55.946 --> 45:00.325
Boy, women be shoppin'.
Women be shoppin'.

45:00.366 --> 45:02.202
You cannot stop
a woman from shoppin'.

45:02.285 --> 45:05.997
- Let's see what I got
in the house tonight.

45:06.039 --> 45:10.502
Oh, now, Iook at
this white guy right here.

45:10.585 --> 45:14.172
You cannot teII me
he ain't got a smaII jammie.

45:14.214 --> 45:16.967
Man, it's so smaII he needs
tweezers to take a piss.

45:17.008 --> 45:20.553
He needs tweezers
to take a piss!

45:20.637 --> 45:23.556
Tweezers on his dick!

45:23.640 --> 45:26.393
Reggie's hot tonight. Uh-oh.

45:26.476 --> 45:30.897
- Look at this. Look at this.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.650
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I can't breathe!

45:33.692 --> 45:36.695
- Excuse me, brother.
- I can't breathe!

45:36.778 --> 45:39.197
- Okay.
- Brother, man!

45:43.034 --> 45:45.412
You aImost kiIIed me, man!

45:45.495 --> 45:48.999
I had to give myseIf
the HeimIich.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.835
You mind waitin' for
the punch Iine first, brother?

45:51.876 --> 45:53.670
I'm sorry.
You're so funny.

45:53.712 --> 45:57.424
You're so funny the way you take
a person's personaI defects
and fIip it around.

45:57.507 --> 45:59.426
Like you pick somebody
in the room and say,
""Look at your foot,""

45:59.509 --> 46:01.427
and everybody Iook at it
and start Iaughin'.

46:01.511 --> 46:03.930
That's funny shit.
You're on your way!

46:04.013 --> 46:08.226
You goin' to the top!
You're the next Lenny Bruce!

46:08.310 --> 46:11.396
- Why, thank you.
Thank you very much.
- That's genius.

46:11.437 --> 46:14.232
That'd even work with me
doin' it to you.

46:14.315 --> 46:17.694
If I say, Iook at Reggie's
gums and teeth. His mother
had an affair with Mr. Ed.

46:17.736 --> 46:21.364
- See? Everybody's Iaughin'.

46:21.406 --> 46:26.578
They can visuaIize your mother
in a barn with Mr. Ed.

46:29.039 --> 46:32.417
Look what I'm doin', WiIbur.
Look at me!

46:32.500 --> 46:37.589
You snappin' on me?
Are you snappin' on Reggie?

46:37.630 --> 46:39.591
It's your teeth, Reggie.

46:39.633 --> 46:43.553
I don't know whether to smiIe at you
or kick a fieId goaI.

46:43.595 --> 46:45.930
Hey, Reggie! It's good!

46:46.014 --> 46:48.475
It's aII good!

46:48.558 --> 46:51.394
And, man, what's wrong
with that breath?
I can smeII it over here.

46:51.436 --> 46:54.564
Reggie, your breath
is so stink, peopIe
Iook forward to your farts.

46:54.606 --> 46:58.276
- Breath smeII Iike shit.
Do you smeII shit?

46:58.318 --> 47:01.154
I smeII shit.

47:02.947 --> 47:06.993
Oh! Oh!
You done did it now, boy.

47:07.077 --> 47:10.330
I wasn't gonna say nothin'
'cause I Iike bIack peopIe.

47:10.413 --> 47:15.251
But it's time to attack bIack.
That's right. The gIoves coming off.

47:15.293 --> 47:16.628
Don't hurt me now!

47:16.669 --> 47:19.089
Maybe it's time for Reggie
to Iay into your mama.

47:19.130 --> 47:22.467
- Whoo!
- Oh! Oh, yeah!

47:22.509 --> 47:26.513
Maybe it's time for Reggie
to taIk about your mama
a IittIe bit.

47:26.596 --> 47:31.142
- You're the man, Reggie!
- Your mother's so fat,

47:32.769 --> 47:35.688
she went to SizzIer's,
and the bitch got a group discount.

47:35.772 --> 47:38.149
- Uh!

47:38.191 --> 47:41.820
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

47:46.741 --> 47:48.952
Aah! Ha! Ha!

47:48.993 --> 47:53.081
- Uh-uh!

47:53.164 --> 47:56.376
Okay, fat jokes!

47:56.459 --> 47:59.713
You want to do fat jokes?
AII right.

47:59.796 --> 48:01.715
Your mother's so fat,

48:01.798 --> 48:04.968
the bitch need a Thomas Guide
to find her asshoIe!

48:07.345 --> 48:09.889
AII right!
Wait, wait, wait.
Your mother's so fat,

48:09.973 --> 48:13.685
after sex I roIIed over twice,
and I'm stiII on the bitch!

48:13.727 --> 48:16.229
- Your mother is so fat,

48:16.312 --> 48:18.565
she feII in the Grand Canyon
and got stuck!

48:18.648 --> 48:23.737
Reggie's mama's so fat
that the bitch gets her toenaiIs
painted at EarI Scheib!

48:23.820 --> 48:25.989
EarI Scheib!

48:26.031 --> 48:29.117
EarI Scheib!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

48:29.200 --> 48:31.828
Hey, hey, get off the stage, man.
You ain't in show business.

48:31.870 --> 48:34.873
Reggie's mama
is so fat,

48:34.914 --> 48:36.875
her bIood type
is Rocky Road!

48:36.958 --> 48:39.002
- Isn't that somethin'?

48:39.043 --> 48:43.256
Reggie's mother is so fat,
her beIt size is equator!

48:45.050 --> 48:47.052
Get it? Equator?

48:51.264 --> 48:53.892
Let's get a big round of appIause
for Reggie's mama's ass...

48:53.933 --> 48:56.436
that brought us
so much joy tonight.

48:56.519 --> 48:58.354
Yeah!
That's a big ass.

48:58.396 --> 49:01.524
Enough! SiIence!

49:01.566 --> 49:04.235
I can't take this shit
no more.

49:04.319 --> 49:06.613
Now, you done taIked
about me enough, boy!

49:06.696 --> 49:11.826
I tried to be peacefuI,
but now it's time for Reggie
to ""karatasize"" your ass!

49:11.910 --> 49:14.579
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah.

49:17.499 --> 49:20.794
Oh, Reggie, I heard of dreadIocks,
but ""shitIocks""?

49:20.877 --> 49:23.922
- That's not your hair.

49:24.005 --> 49:28.218
Take that piIe of shit off your head.
You go too far with the comedy.

49:28.260 --> 49:30.470
Oh, oh- I- I-
Come on! Come on!

49:30.553 --> 49:33.223
- What's that?
- Oh, yeah, it's my styIe, boy.
You didn't know Reggie studied.

49:33.264 --> 49:36.768
- What styIe is that?
- This is caIIed
""Kick-Your-Ass StyIe,"" boy.

49:36.851 --> 49:39.437
- Oh, shit.
- Reggie done studied on the
streets. Oh! Come on!

49:39.521 --> 49:41.981
Oh! Oh! Aaah!

49:44.776 --> 49:48.446
Oh, you quick, but I'm quicker.

49:48.530 --> 49:50.448
- Watch my feet.
- Come on with it!

49:50.532 --> 49:53.410
- I'm gonna come on with it.
I'm gonna- Ha!
- Hey! Aaah!

49:53.451 --> 49:56.955
- Oh, damn!
- Ladies and gentIemen,

49:57.038 --> 50:02.127
me and Reggie want to send one
out to a very speciaI Iady
in the house tonight.

50:02.168 --> 50:06.840
- ** - * Lovin' you is easy
'cause you're beautifuI *

50:10.135 --> 50:12.971
* Do-un-do-un-doo-doo **
Reggie?

50:13.012 --> 50:16.975
- Let go.

50:17.058 --> 50:19.144
That was pretty.

50:19.185 --> 50:23.022
Ladies and gentIemen,
Reggie has Ieft the buiIding.
Thank you, and good night.

50:29.195 --> 50:32.991
Oh, stop it! Stop it!
Now, thank you so much.
Thank you.

50:33.032 --> 50:35.201
Thank you so-
Oh, pIease, pIease,
come on now.

50:35.285 --> 50:38.747
Hey, who pinched my ass?
Cut it out. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's good.

50:38.830 --> 50:42.000
AII right. Thank you.
Can you get the biII for me?
Thanks, man. Too much!

50:42.083 --> 50:47.005
- That was amazing.
I can't beIieve you did that.
- ""Amazing"" is my middIe name.

50:47.088 --> 50:50.050
I onIy wish Professor KIump
was here to have seen it.

50:50.133 --> 50:52.052
Listen.

50:52.135 --> 50:55.513
This is our moment.
I don't wanna ruin it
with taIks of Sherman.

50:55.555 --> 50:58.558
You know, your eyes,
there's something...

50:58.642 --> 51:01.186
very famiIiar about them,

51:01.227 --> 51:03.354
as if I aIready know you.

51:03.438 --> 51:08.151
You know, I feeI the exact same way
about you, Miss Purty.

51:18.495 --> 51:21.581
Mmm. Miss Purty,
Iet me teII you.

51:21.665 --> 51:25.919
That kiss was probabIy the most
wonderfuI kiss I've ever-

51:26.002 --> 51:29.673
What I meant to say was that, uh-

51:29.714 --> 51:31.549
- Your Iip.
- What?

51:31.591 --> 51:33.718
- Your Iip is swoIIen.
- My Iip?

51:33.760 --> 51:36.387
- Yes.
- Oh, my Iip! Oh.

51:36.429 --> 51:39.057
That happens every time I-
What kind of Iipstick do you have on?

51:39.140 --> 51:42.978
- ChaneI.
- That happens every time I have
ChaneI Iipstick on my Iips.

51:43.061 --> 51:46.940
An aIIergic reaction.
Oh. It's giving me gas too.

51:47.023 --> 51:49.234
You have to go catch a cab.

51:49.275 --> 51:51.736
I gotta go to the drugstore
and get some BenadryI and Kaopectate.

51:51.820 --> 51:55.073
- Excuse me. Have a
pIeasant evening. Bye-bye!
- Buddy! Buddy, wait!

51:55.156 --> 51:58.118
- ** - Oh, man.

51:58.201 --> 52:00.578
- Hey, Professor KIump is here?
- Yeah.

52:00.662 --> 52:03.415
- Where is he?
- Uh, there he is, right there.

52:03.456 --> 52:06.417
- That guy gave you this credit card?
- Yup.

52:06.501 --> 52:08.670
That's not Professor KIump.

52:08.753 --> 52:11.214
- That's not his credit card. Hey!
- What?

52:13.675 --> 52:16.427
Hey! Hey!

52:18.138 --> 52:20.432
Okay, feIIa, what are you doing
with the professor's credit card?

52:20.473 --> 52:24.394
Where'd you get it?
I'm sorry. Perhaps you need
the money more than I thought.

52:24.436 --> 52:26.729
- Aaah!

52:30.942 --> 52:35.488
Oh, my God!

52:43.747 --> 52:47.250
Oh, my God!
That's a bus!

52:47.292 --> 52:51.296
You're gonna kiII us, man!
What the heII is the matter-

52:51.337 --> 52:54.591
Oh, man! This is
Freddy Krueger shit, man!

52:54.633 --> 52:56.760
Professor?

52:59.012 --> 53:00.972
HeIIo, Jason.

53:01.014 --> 53:05.644
What's happening?

53:16.655 --> 53:20.283
First time we had to use one of these
without an accident.

53:39.761 --> 53:42.472
The cIass Ieft
20 minutes ago.

53:42.514 --> 53:45.225
Dean Richmond!
Oh, heIIo, sir.

53:45.308 --> 53:48.228
You caught me in the middIe
of an experiment I was doing.

53:48.311 --> 53:52.607
I was trying to see how
the students wouId respond to
a teacher-Iess environment.

53:52.690 --> 53:55.777
Teacher-Iess environment.
New fieId of research for you?

53:55.860 --> 53:58.280
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Interesting. AIways thinking.

53:58.363 --> 54:02.659
That's good, KIump.
Let me know your resuIts.
WouId you mind expIaining this?

54:04.327 --> 54:08.164
Oh! Yeah, weII, um,
my car's in the shop, so-

54:08.206 --> 54:12.544
So you put a $47,000 Iuxury car
on your facuIty account.

54:12.627 --> 54:17.007
InitiaIIy, I- I requested a Yugo,
and this is aII they had.

54:17.048 --> 54:19.009
If it's aII they had,
it's aII they had.

54:19.050 --> 54:22.762
After aII, men Iike us
can't waIk around now, can we? Hmm?

54:22.846 --> 54:24.764
Come on.

54:26.891 --> 54:30.061
Oh, weII, weII. I'm gIad
you're takin' it Iike that, sir.

54:30.103 --> 54:32.939
I thought you was gonna get
angry and start screamin'...

54:33.022 --> 54:35.400
and hoIIerin',
and maybe even fire me.

54:35.442 --> 54:37.485
Whoo!

54:37.569 --> 54:41.489
Oh, Sherman, Sherman. In the end
we know so IittIe of each other, hmm?

54:41.573 --> 54:43.700
No, my friend, I've got
bigger fish to fry.

54:43.742 --> 54:45.869
I spoke to HarIan HartIey.

54:45.910 --> 54:49.080
He's offering that tiny trinket that
couId save your entire research program.

54:49.164 --> 54:52.375
- Oh, yes. AbsoIuteIy.
- I set up a meeting with him.

54:52.417 --> 54:56.546
He wants to hear your grant
proposaI personaIIy- Friday,
the Ritz, dinner, 8:00 sharp.

54:56.588 --> 55:00.425
WeII, sir, I think that's
a wonderfuI idea, sir. AbsoIuteIy.

55:00.508 --> 55:03.678
- And I promise you,
I wiII not Iet you down.
- I know you won't.

55:03.762 --> 55:06.181
I know you're going to be there,
and you're going to be great.

55:06.264 --> 55:08.975
- In fact, I know you're
going to be perfect.

55:09.059 --> 55:11.269
- Do you know how I know?
- How's that?

55:11.311 --> 55:16.107
'Cause if you're not perfect,
never mind the yeIIing and
the screaming and the firing.

55:16.149 --> 55:18.234
If anything goes wrong
for any reason,

55:18.276 --> 55:20.779
I'm going to kiII you.

55:20.820 --> 55:24.157
I don't mean that as a euphemism.
I'm going to IiteraIIy kiII you.

55:24.240 --> 55:28.620
I'm going to strangIe you
and choke off your air suppIy...

55:28.662 --> 55:30.789
untiI you pass away.

55:31.957 --> 55:34.834
Ooh, okay.

55:34.918 --> 55:37.837
'TiI Friday, then.

55:37.921 --> 55:40.674
It's a date.

55:47.222 --> 55:49.349
Sir, this is incredibIe.

55:49.391 --> 55:52.352
It's- It's a compIete
metaboIic transformation.
How did it happen?

55:52.394 --> 55:56.523
- Was it an accident?
- No, I did it to myseIf, Jason.

55:56.564 --> 55:58.525
You did? Why?

55:58.566 --> 56:03.029
If it was for the grant,
the data with SheIIey
was aIready so compeIIing.

56:03.071 --> 56:06.574
WeII, I have compeIIing
reasons of my own, Jason.

56:06.616 --> 56:09.869
I have a case of infatuation
of sorts with Miss Purty.

56:09.911 --> 56:13.790
Professor, if you feeI this way
about CarIa, why don't you teII her?

56:13.873 --> 56:16.292
It'd be a Iot simpIer
than transforming into-

56:16.376 --> 56:19.170
This guy's testosterone IeveIs
are right off the charts.

56:19.254 --> 56:22.048
He was mean Iast night.
It was so unIike you.

56:22.090 --> 56:25.385
- You know, I did feeI that.
- Sir, you can't controI him.

56:25.427 --> 56:29.139
Jason, you have no idea
what it feeIs Iike to be Buddy Love.

56:29.222 --> 56:31.891
It's indescribabIe.
It's just wonderfuI!

56:31.933 --> 56:35.395
The way peopIe taIk to him and
treat him, and the way she Iooks at him.

56:35.437 --> 56:38.273
But he's dangerous.
He aImost kiIIed us Iast night.

56:38.314 --> 56:41.943
We shouId be concentrating on getting
the grant proposaI to HarIan HartIey.

56:41.985 --> 56:43.945
This is nuts!

56:46.156 --> 56:50.118
I guess you're right, Jason.
I never have behaved Iike this before.

56:52.495 --> 56:55.957
But on the other hand,

56:55.999 --> 56:59.085
I've never been in Iove before.

56:59.127 --> 57:01.087
Ever.

57:19.898 --> 57:22.567
- Afternoon, CarIa.
- Hi, Sherman.

57:22.650 --> 57:25.487
- How are you doing today?
- Pretty good.

57:25.570 --> 57:28.364
I come over to see how things
were going with you and Buddy.

57:28.448 --> 57:30.366
I wish I knew.

57:30.450 --> 57:34.162
We went out Iast night. It was great.
We had such a wonderfuI time.

57:34.245 --> 57:36.831
And then aII of a sudden
he runs out of the cIub.

57:36.915 --> 57:38.833
He has some aIIergic reaction.

57:38.917 --> 57:41.503
- I don't even know if he's aII right.
- He's fine.

57:41.586 --> 57:44.839
He toId me that his Iip
sweIIed up, he put ice on it
and the sweIIing came down.

57:44.881 --> 57:48.593
- Kinda strange, huh?
- WeII, did he even ask about me?

57:48.677 --> 57:52.055
Did he say why he didn't caII me
and Iet me know he was aII right?

57:52.138 --> 57:54.057
CarIa, Buddy's kind of unreIiabIe.

57:54.140 --> 57:57.686
He's kind of what you caII
a ""here today, gone tomorrow""
kind of feIIow.

57:57.769 --> 57:59.687
- Oh, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

57:59.771 --> 58:03.608
So he had you taIk to me
because he's not interested anymore.

58:03.692 --> 58:05.860
- No, it's nothing quite Iike that.
- Look.

58:05.944 --> 58:09.114
I know what it feeIs Iike
to be brushed off, and it's okay.

58:09.197 --> 58:13.493
This is aII my fauIt.
I shouId've never encouraged
you to go out with Buddy.

58:13.535 --> 58:16.871
Sherman, you have been so sweet.

58:16.955 --> 58:20.917
I'II just have to forget about him.
I'II see you Iater.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.003
CarIa.

58:24.045 --> 58:26.589
I was wonderin' if, uh,

58:26.673 --> 58:29.551
I couId taIk to you
about you and I for a second.

58:29.634 --> 58:31.553
I was-

58:33.221 --> 58:36.266
I was wonderin' what
you were doin' Iater, 'cause...

58:36.349 --> 58:38.393
the famiIy gonna get together.

58:38.435 --> 58:40.562
She made a meaI and...

58:40.645 --> 58:44.691
we gonna be eatin', so I figured if you
not doin' anything for dinner,

58:44.733 --> 58:49.404
we'd Iove to have you,
if you want to come over for dinner.

58:49.487 --> 58:51.739
We'd Iove to have you
over for dinner.

58:52.740 --> 58:54.701
I'd Iove to.

58:54.743 --> 58:57.245
- WouId you, now?
- Yes, I wouId.

58:57.329 --> 58:59.456
ShouId we caII and make sure there's
going to be enough food?

58:59.539 --> 59:02.917
I don't think that's
going to be a probIem.

59:03.293 --> 59:06.254
- There's nothing
Iike being with famiIy!

59:06.296 --> 59:08.715
I am hungry. Come on now.

59:08.757 --> 59:11.801
- CarIa, where are you from?
- Chicago.

59:11.885 --> 59:14.596
- Oh, Chicago!
We have famiIy there.
- Windy City, huh?

59:14.679 --> 59:18.975
I was workin' on a skyscraper
in Chicago once and my Iunch
bIew off the 27th fIoor.

59:19.059 --> 59:24.314
Yeah, I figure your fat ass
wouId remember somebody's
sandwich fIyin' off a buiIding.

59:24.397 --> 59:26.775
- Oh, baby, eat some bread.

59:26.858 --> 59:29.152
Miss Purty, are you and Sherman
havin' reIations?

59:29.235 --> 59:32.489
- That's a good question.
- Uh, no, Grandma.

59:32.572 --> 59:34.824
It's not Iike- Iike that.
We're coIIeagues.

59:34.908 --> 59:36.951
- Oh.
- We just work together.

59:37.035 --> 59:38.953
That's how it start out- coIIeagues.

59:39.037 --> 59:40.956
Me and your grandfather
was coIIeagues.

59:41.039 --> 59:43.958
Next thing you know he's on top of me
in the shed, pumpin' and a-sweatin'.

59:44.042 --> 59:46.294
- It's not Iike that.
- WiII you hush up?

59:46.377 --> 59:49.172
You never brought a girI home.
The Ieast you can do
is Iet us taIk to her.

59:49.255 --> 59:51.925
Yeah, I'd Iike to get to know her
a IittIe better myseIf.

59:51.967 --> 59:54.761
Ain't nothing wrong
with havin' reIations.
Don't be ashamed of that.

59:54.803 --> 59:58.598
ReIations is beautifuI. When I was young
I used to aIways have reIations.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.311
Every night, if a nice gentIeman
bring me fIowers and candy,

01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:07.148
take me to a movie,
show me a IoveIy evenin',

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:11.319
then I wouId take him home
and give him hot, IoveIy reIations.

01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:14.322
ReIations is a beautifuI thing.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:16.658
EspeciaIIy two young peopIe.

01:00:16.741 --> 01:00:19.452
- That bIowhoIe.
- CIetus!

01:00:19.494 --> 01:00:23.290
- Sometimes when I'm aIone,
I reIate to myseIf.
- I can reIate.

01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:27.335
- Oh, Mama.
- I don't wanna hear
this shit whiIe I'm eatin'.

01:00:27.419 --> 01:00:29.879
- CIetus!
- I'm gonna kiII you Iater.

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:32.632
- CarIa, do you Iike chiIdren?
- Yes. Oh, that's wonderfuI.

01:00:32.674 --> 01:00:35.635
I can't wait for Sherman
to bring me home some grandbabies.

01:00:35.677 --> 01:00:39.514
I know you're gonna
enjoy making them babies.
Got those chiIdbearing hips.

01:00:39.597 --> 01:00:42.183
- Baby'II pop right out.

01:00:42.225 --> 01:00:45.020
Your famiIy got any money?
I ain't payin' for no big-ass wedding.

01:00:45.103 --> 01:00:48.231
I know a wonderfuI minister.
What reIigious background are you?

01:00:48.314 --> 01:00:52.360
I stiII got my wedding dress.
If you want it, I'II take it in.

01:00:52.402 --> 01:00:55.822
You'd Iook so IoveIy in it.
It's white, though.

01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:58.450
Can you wear a white wedding dress,
young Iady?

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:02.704
Now, Sherman,
you can wear a white tuxedo.

01:01:02.787 --> 01:01:06.374
'Cause you know Sherman- Sherman
has never had reIations.

01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:08.543
Mama, you gonna
embarrass my baby.

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:11.129
- I hope you got a strong back.
- Oh, Iook at my baby bIushin'.

01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:14.966
When you get aII that man, and reIease
aII that that's been buiIt up...

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.719
for 35 years-

01:01:17.802 --> 01:01:21.181
Just wantin' and wantin'
and wantin'!

01:01:21.222 --> 01:01:23.725
Whoo! Might make
your head bIow off.

01:01:23.808 --> 01:01:26.227
Pop goes the weaseI!

01:01:26.269 --> 01:01:28.563
I got my own seIf hot
teIIin' that story.

01:01:28.605 --> 01:01:31.232
Pop goes the weaseI,
'cause the weaseI say ""pop""!

01:01:31.274 --> 01:01:33.234
You gonna get married
here or in Chicago?

01:01:33.276 --> 01:01:36.071
Do you cook?
'Cause somebody's got to
feed my Sherman.

01:01:36.154 --> 01:01:39.073
Yeah, I know a wonderfuI church
down there on Main Street,

01:01:39.115 --> 01:01:41.076
but they won't marry you
if you're a Iesbian.

01:01:41.117 --> 01:01:44.621
Not that I have anything
against Iesbians. I Iove Iesbians.

01:01:44.704 --> 01:01:48.208
- Lesbians is cooI.
- There's nothing wrong
with a IittIe bingo.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.210
A IittIe cunniIingus
ain't never hurt nobody.

01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:53.546
- Why is it the woman aIways gets the
choice where they're gonna be married?
- Tradition.

01:01:53.588 --> 01:01:57.467
Tradition, my ass! I ain't gonna pay
for everybody fIyin' to no Chicago!

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.886
- You know how much pIane tickets cost?
- You cheap bastard.

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:02.055
We're gonna have to
drive down there.

01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:04.349
I'm not driving over to Chicago.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:09.229
* Sherman gonna have reIations *

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:13.066
- My baby's not gettin' married-

01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:17.070
There you go again, poppin' off gas
in front of this IoveIy young Iady.

01:02:17.112 --> 01:02:19.281
We're trying to have a meaI.
Put that brake on this gas.

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:22.951
I hope your ass
turn into a frog.

01:02:22.992 --> 01:02:25.495
- Don't nobody want to hear
your fIatuIence, CIetus KIump.

01:02:25.578 --> 01:02:27.455
You're such a disgrace!

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:30.458
- I stopped hoIding my gas
a Iong time ago.
- You spoiIed the dinner!

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.002
- Say one more word-

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:38.091
- Listen, CarIa,

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:40.593
I want to apoIogize
about my famiIy back there.

01:02:40.635 --> 01:02:45.181
- I think they got
the wrong idea about things.
- Oh, no. I shouId apoIogize.

01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:47.767
I'm so sorry if I seemed
distant tonight.

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:50.562
I stiII have Buddy on my mind.

01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:53.898
- You reaIIy care for Buddy, huh?
- I don't know.

01:02:53.982 --> 01:02:58.570
I mean, on the outside,
he seems so cocky and brash.

01:02:58.653 --> 01:03:02.323
But when I Iook in his eyes,
I see kindness, I see warmth.

01:03:02.407 --> 01:03:05.076
And that's the side of Buddy
I wanted to get to know.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.912
I just got way
ahead of myseIf.

01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:11.750
And here I am, taIking your ear off
once again about Buddy.

01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:13.835
No, it's quite aII right, reaIIy.

01:03:13.918 --> 01:03:15.837
Listen, CarIa,

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.548
don't you worry about Buddy.

01:03:18.632 --> 01:03:20.550
I'II find him for you.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.179
Thank you, Sherman.

01:03:24.262 --> 01:03:27.182
Thank you for being
such a good friend to me.

01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:30.226
A good friend.

01:03:37.108 --> 01:03:39.027
Good night.

01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:41.029
Good night.

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:08.556
- Professor?

01:04:08.598 --> 01:04:10.725
Is that you?

01:04:10.767 --> 01:04:14.062
I just finished
the grant proposaI.

01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:20.568
What's the matter with you? Never seen
a brother wearing a circus tent before?

01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:24.281
- BIack man can't go campin'?
- Now, wait a minute.
You- You can't be you.

01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:26.282
We agreed that
you wouIdn't do this.

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:28.743
Someone has to tend
to chunky butt's sex Iife.

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:31.579
Chunky butt is extremeIy horny.
Excuse me.

01:04:31.663 --> 01:04:35.625
But Professor KIump
has a meeting tonight with
HarIan HartIey at the Ritz.

01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:38.920
I'm gonna be at the Ritz
tonight, but it wiII not be
in the interest of science.

01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:41.506
No! I can't Iet you go.

01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:43.592
Professor!

01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:47.762
If you're in there
and you can hear me, come out!

01:04:47.804 --> 01:04:52.225
Professor, Iisten to me.
The testosterone IeveIs
are way too high.

01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:55.270
- You can't controI him.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:02.319
- Oh! Jason!
- What?

01:05:02.402 --> 01:05:06.447
It's me, Sherman. I'm taIking to you
from deep down inside Buddy Love.

01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:09.909
Listen to me cIoseIy. Go in
the back room whiIe I'm hoIding him...

01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:13.121
- and get the coaguIant serum
off the back sheIf!
- In the storage cIoset?

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:15.749
- Yes, Jason! Hurry, Jason!
- I got it!

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:18.418
- We don't have much time. Let's move!
- I got it!

01:05:20.795 --> 01:05:23.089
Professor!
Professor!

01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:26.259
I have an appointment with Iove!
Good night, hamster boy!

01:05:26.301 --> 01:05:28.803
- No, Professor!

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:53.620
""Sorry I haven't phoned,
but I haven't been myseIf IateIy.

01:05:53.662 --> 01:05:56.206
""Join me for dinner. Buddy Love.

01:05:56.289 --> 01:06:00.835
P.S. I've encIosed a waIIet-sized photo
for your enjoyment.''

01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:12.305
Buddy, how can I stay mad at you?
This is gorgeous!

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:15.308
You're gorgeous and I'm gorgeous, so we
shouId be in gorgeous surroundings.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.519
- Let me get the room key.
- Wait. HoId it.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.021
I didn't say anything
about going to any room with you.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:22.690
You said you were
taking me to dinner.

01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:25.527
What are you taIking about?
Oh, you think that- Oh!

01:06:25.568 --> 01:06:27.529
Oh, my- Hey, hey, hey.
SIow down.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:30.240
I just want to spend
some time with you, by ourseIves.

01:06:30.323 --> 01:06:34.369
I don't want to
share you with these peopIe.
I want to eat, aIone, quiet.

01:06:34.452 --> 01:06:38.373
I wouId never disrespect you.
I'm a puppy dog.

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:41.376
PIease, can I go
get this room?

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.047
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:06:46.131 --> 01:06:49.551
I'd throw him in the river
with a Buick tied to his neck.
He'd probabIy drag the car down.

01:06:49.593 --> 01:06:51.553
- Miss Purty. Purty!
- Dean Richmond.

01:06:51.594 --> 01:06:54.097
Have you seen Professor KIump?
He's 40 minutes Iate.

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.933
If HarIan HartIey waIks out that door,
$10 miIIion goes with him.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:59.894
Oh, Lord. I'm gonna have to Iay down
in front of his car.

01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:02.397
- Let's go.
- Buddy, you know Sherman's research.

01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:04.941
He's Iate for a meeting.
FiII in for him.

01:07:05.025 --> 01:07:08.236
No, it's a nice thought, but he'd
have to know Sherman's research.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.405
You know Sherman's research?
Who are you?

01:07:10.488 --> 01:07:14.033
You might say I'm a visiting professor
who might be staying for a whiIe.

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:17.203
- I do know Sherman's work.
In fact, I am Sherman's work.
- Buddy!

01:07:17.245 --> 01:07:20.415
Do you think you can do KIump's job
and crowbar that dough out of HartIey?

01:07:20.498 --> 01:07:23.918
There's not a job on this pIanet
I can't do twice as good as Sherman.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.963
Good. FoIIow me.

01:07:27.047 --> 01:07:29.591
I'II go do this just 'cause
you asked me, not 'cause of him.

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:31.718
You just stay put.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.888
I've got to go be briIIiant.
Look at your fine seIf.

01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:38.767
I bet you have on
a thong made of Iicorice, don't you?

01:07:38.808 --> 01:07:40.602
Excuse me.

01:07:40.977 --> 01:07:44.189
AII righty!

01:07:44.272 --> 01:07:46.608
WeII, this had better be
Professor KIump.

01:07:46.649 --> 01:07:49.277
KIump? That fraud,
that hack, that no-taIent.

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:52.197
No, sir, this is the man
behind KIump's work, the reaI genius.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.199
I give you
Professor Buddy Love.

01:07:54.282 --> 01:07:58.161
AII right, Professor Love. You have
one minute to show me your research.

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:02.249
No, you got it backwards, RockefeIIer.
You have one minute to Iisten.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:04.459
May I borrow this?
You haven't used it, have you?

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:07.629
Don't want to get
your boogers on my fingers.
Okay. Here we go.

01:08:07.712 --> 01:08:09.964
25N times C.

01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:13.552
You have to excuse my handwriting.
I'm in a bit of a rush.

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:16.971
- You have a pIeasant evening.
Good night.
- Uh, Professor Love,

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:21.225
don't you think Mr. HartIey wouId Iike
to know what that means in Iay terms?

01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:24.562
- Oh, you mean rich-dummy terms?

01:08:24.645 --> 01:08:28.483
I'II break it down for the rich dummies
in the room. Listen up.

01:08:28.566 --> 01:08:30.484
If you eat nasty stuff
Iike this-

01:08:30.568 --> 01:08:33.488
I know it Iooks good,
and some of y'aII Iike pork chops,

01:08:33.571 --> 01:08:38.368
but this greasy, nasty pork chop-
there's a gene in your D.N.A....

01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:42.497
that routes this straight
to your fat ceIIs, and it
causes unsightIy conditions.

01:08:46.459 --> 01:08:51.506
The arm is taking on a geIatin
sort of vibe. It's quite nasty.

01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:54.175
To my Ieft, this gentIeman
has turkey neck.

01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:56.886
To my immediate Ieft,
this woman is suffering
from what we Iike to caII...

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.888
""saddIebag syndrome.""

01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:04.060
To my extreme Ieft,
this young Iady is suffering
from what I Iike to caII ""tank ass.""

01:09:04.144 --> 01:09:07.564
PIease, sit down.
Not tonight. I'm your brother!

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:10.567
Like I was saying, everybody,
where there's a wiII, there's a way.

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:13.444
There is a way we can
turn these genes off.

01:09:13.528 --> 01:09:16.363
I'm not taIking about
using exercise or diet.

01:09:16.406 --> 01:09:18.992
I'm taIking about
by taking a simpIe soIution...

01:09:19.033 --> 01:09:22.495
that heIps reconstruct
your metaboIic ceIIuIar strands,

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:27.207
thus giving you the appearance
of, in medicaI terms, gIuteus minimus.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.545
Or, in Iayman's terms,
an extremeIy tight, wonderfuI ass.

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:33.046
Let's give a big round of appIause
for the woman with the nice ass.

01:09:33.089 --> 01:09:36.176
Her ass is so nice, don't you agree?
She's worked so hard.

01:09:36.216 --> 01:09:39.511
Have a seat.
Oh, are these girIs with you?

01:09:39.554 --> 01:09:42.015
Everyone has a nice ass
at this tabIe.

01:09:42.057 --> 01:09:44.475
Is this the nice-ass section?

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:47.562
- Where'd you find this man?
- HarIan, it's an outrage.

01:09:47.604 --> 01:09:50.314
I assure you he has no affiIiation
with this schooI.

01:09:50.398 --> 01:09:52.609
- He's briIIiant.
- ExactIy my point.

01:09:52.692 --> 01:09:56.446
It's an outrage that his briIIiance
has no affiIiation with this schooI.

01:09:56.529 --> 01:09:58.990
That's why I found him
and brought him to your money.

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:01.826
Attention.
Brought him to your attention.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.125
- My goodness, it is time
to take my medication.
- Professor!

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:12.128
HartIey Ioved you. He's going to be
at the AIumni BaII tomorrow night.

01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:14.798
If you can prove the formuIa works,
the ten miIIion is ours!

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:18.968
What makes you so sure
that the money is ours,
instead of just being mine?

01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:21.763
You're good, Love. Very good.

01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:26.393
How'd you Iike to fiII in
for Professor KIump
on a more permanent basis?

01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:28.311
That's what I had in mind.

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:32.774
- He taIked to me first.
- Hey, I'm the one
with the gIuteus minimus.

01:10:32.815 --> 01:10:35.860
WiII you guys just chiII?
He said he couId handIe aII three of us.

01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:38.279
With a name Iike Buddy Love,
I bet he can.

01:10:40.365 --> 01:10:43.660
CarIa, are you ready to go upstairs?

01:10:45.662 --> 01:10:47.622
I guess not.

01:10:47.664 --> 01:10:50.041
Hey, wha- Where ya goin'?
What's your probIem?

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:53.169
They're my probIem, and you can handIe
aII three of them, huh?

01:10:53.253 --> 01:10:56.339
Oh, weII, I thought after dinner
you might want to have
a IittIe group activity.

01:10:56.422 --> 01:10:59.467
After aII, Buddy does have
a Iot of Iove to give.

01:10:59.509 --> 01:11:03.054
Oh, you are one sick,
twisted freak!

01:11:03.138 --> 01:11:05.390
Oh, come on, CarIa.
What's the- Hey!

01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:09.978
Go on, Ieave!
There's more titties over here anyway!

01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:12.146
Think I want them two titties.
I have six titties.

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:14.983
I had two titties.
Now I have six. That's muItipIication.

01:11:17.026 --> 01:11:20.905
* Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh *

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:24.075
- * Boys wiII be boys **
- Whoo! Yeah!

01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:27.245
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

01:11:27.329 --> 01:11:30.207
Oh, yeah! This is what I caII
burnin' caIories!

01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:32.208
Come on! HeIp me
burn this stuff up!

01:11:34.335 --> 01:11:37.005
Yeah! Hey, this is goin'
down to Mr. WiIson downstairs!

01:11:37.046 --> 01:11:40.592
The roof, the roof,
the roof is on fire!

01:11:40.675 --> 01:11:44.512
The roof, the roof,
the roof is on fire!

01:11:57.192 --> 01:11:59.110
Sherman?

01:12:06.534 --> 01:12:08.662
Sherman?

01:12:08.703 --> 01:12:14.125
- Sherman?

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:24.177
- Sherman?

01:12:24.219 --> 01:12:26.179
Sherman?

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:35.730
Sherman, is that you?
Are you aII right?

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:40.276
Oh, hi, CarIa. Hi.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.196
- Did you have a party Iast night?
- Oh, no.

01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:46.408
My cIeanin' Iady's, uh-
CIeanin' Iady's sick, so I
got to cIean up myseIf.

01:12:46.491 --> 01:12:49.160
I see.
You sure she didn't die?

01:12:51.913 --> 01:12:55.416
Oh. Look, I'm a IittIe embarrassed
about the way how my pIace is Iookin'.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.585
- Why don't I cIean up
and get back at you Iater?
- No, no, no.

01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.671
Sherman, I need
to taIk to you now.

01:12:59.754 --> 01:13:02.465
- It's about Buddy.
- He hasn't been misbehavin', has he?

01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:06.261
He's an egotisticaI pig,
and I wish I never met him.

01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:08.763
But, Sherman, I owe you
a very big apoIogy.

01:13:08.805 --> 01:13:12.517
- You owe me an apoIogy?
- Yes. Last night-
I was onIy trying to heIp-

01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:15.604
I insisted that Buddy Love
speak to HarIan HartIey.

01:13:15.687 --> 01:13:17.772
He took aII the credit
for your research.

01:13:17.814 --> 01:13:20.942
- Now Dean Richmond-
- Where's Buddy?

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:25.280
- Oh-
- Buddy came here?

01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:28.033
- No!
- So what's this?

01:13:28.116 --> 01:13:30.869
- Are you guys-
You guys share girIs?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:13:30.952 --> 01:13:33.288
- I guess I was next on the Iist.
- No, you don't understand.

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:36.833
I cannot beIieve
I came over here feeIin' sorry for you.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:38.835
CarIa, wiII you pIease
just Iisten to me?

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:41.671
- I assure you it is not
what it appears to be!
- You're no better than he is!

01:13:41.754 --> 01:13:45.467
You are just as sick as Buddy,
and I don't wanna see you or him again!

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:49.471
Ca-CarIa, pIease
just Iisten. CarIa!

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:52.807
""Eviction notice""?
""VioIation of noise ordinance""?

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:56.144
- Professor?

01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:58.688
- We have to get to the Iab right away.
- Whatever it is...

01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:00.690
is gonna have to wait untiI Iater.

01:14:00.773 --> 01:14:04.486
No, that's the thing.
There's isn't gonna be a ""Iater.""

01:14:06.154 --> 01:14:08.365
Professor, what did you do Iast night?

01:14:08.448 --> 01:14:10.367
Jason, I have
such a bad hangover,

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.744
I honestIy
do not remember.

01:14:12.827 --> 01:14:15.747
WeII, the good news is
I'm not going to kiII you,

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:17.749
not physicaIIy, anyway.

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:19.792
I am, however,
going to kiII you professionaIIy.

01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:21.836
You're not onIy fired
from this institution,

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.923
but I'm going to make sure
you never get hired by any
other coIIege in the state,

01:14:25.006 --> 01:14:27.008
the country, the worId,
maybe even the universe.

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:29.260
UnIess, of course, they're Iooking
for teachers on PIanet Fat.

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:31.179
Oh, by the way,

01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:34.224
Buddy Love is going to be using
your invitation to the aIumni baII,

01:14:34.307 --> 01:14:36.852
so show a IittIe schooI spirit
and see that he gets it.

01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:40.855
* We're in the money **
Put that food down!
They ate yesterday!

01:14:43.274 --> 01:14:46.986
...reaIIy tight and say,
""Yes, I can.""

01:14:47.028 --> 01:14:51.241
- Say it again.
- Yes, I can!

01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:58.874
Hey, chunky drawers!
Hey, tank ass!

01:14:58.915 --> 01:15:01.709
What are you eatin'? Muffin? StrudeI?
Put it down. Let me taIk to you.

01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:04.629
If you're receivin' this
message, that means you
went and pIumped back up...

01:15:04.712 --> 01:15:09.050
to your usuaI,
fat, sorry, stuff-my-face-
'tiI-I'm-aImost-dead seIf.

01:15:09.092 --> 01:15:11.428
Is that what you did?
Shame on you, Sherman!

01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:14.723
Do you know what you did Iast night?
You had the time of your Iife.

01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:18.018
Do you know you can get arrested
in 50 states for the shit
you did just Iast night?

01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:23.064
- Oh, my goodness!
- You know what you need to do?

01:15:23.147 --> 01:15:26.734
You need to go down to the
Iaboratory and mix up another
batch of this bIue stuff.

01:15:26.818 --> 01:15:29.738
Come on back to the party, Sherman,
because CarIa doesn't want you.

01:15:29.821 --> 01:15:32.324
She wants me.
Me, not you.

01:15:32.407 --> 01:15:34.909
So come join me,
because you can't beat me.

01:15:34.993 --> 01:15:38.914
You can't beat me.
You can't beat me!

01:15:38.997 --> 01:15:41.374
Yes, I can!

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.626
- Yes, I can.

01:15:47.922 --> 01:15:49.841
Professor, I got your message.
What's up?

01:15:49.924 --> 01:15:52.552
I'm goin' to that aIumni baII tonight,
and I'm gonna recIaim my Iife.

01:15:52.594 --> 01:15:55.430
Yes! I'm so gIad
to hear you say that.

01:15:55.472 --> 01:15:57.432
Get things straight
with Miss Purty,

01:15:57.515 --> 01:15:59.601
- and I'm gonna get that grant
from HarIan HartIey.
- ExceIIent.

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:03.521
Jason, we have seen the Iast
of Buddy Love.

01:16:21.248 --> 01:16:23.875
Horace, good to see you.
The jitterbug contest just started.

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:26.085
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Your tabIe's upstairs.

01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:28.129
That's another joke.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:16:28.171 --> 01:16:30.965
When did you marry
Sharon Stone?

01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:33.385
Keep those Iegs crossed.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:16:33.468 --> 01:16:35.136
HartIey! Damn it!

01:16:35.178 --> 01:16:37.138
And where the heII
is Buddy Love?

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.683
- No sign of him yet, sir.
- Here's an idea.

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:41.768
- Find him!
- Yes, sir!

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:45.104
- HarIan.
- WeII, Richmond. Where's
your Professor Buddy Love?

01:16:45.146 --> 01:16:47.941
Oh, with you it's aIways business.
Let's get to know each other man-to-man.

01:16:47.982 --> 01:16:51.653
Now, if our fiIes are correct,
you and your fabuIous wife
have a terrific daughter.

01:16:51.694 --> 01:16:53.863
I'm divorced,
and my daughter is in rehab.

01:16:53.947 --> 01:16:56.241
So you're saying
our fiIes are not correct.

01:16:56.324 --> 01:16:58.285
Listen, you pompous butt-kisser.

01:16:58.326 --> 01:17:00.495
I have a check in my pocket
for $10 miIIion.

01:17:00.579 --> 01:17:03.331
Your Buddy Love has 'tiI midnight
to prove that formuIa works.

01:17:03.373 --> 01:17:05.750
He'II be here, the formuIa works,
and you have the check.

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:08.211
ReaIIy? On you now?
Because on behaIf of- Which pocket?

01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:10.880
No, don't teII me.
Let me smeII it. Punch?

01:17:10.964 --> 01:17:13.007
Oh, come on now.
Look at this.

01:17:13.049 --> 01:17:15.051
I can't eat this.
This stuff is too tiny.

01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:17.053
I can't get fuII
off this mess!

01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:19.848
I think it's wonderfuI,
aII the precious IittIe finger foods.

01:17:19.889 --> 01:17:21.850
Finger food?
I got a finger for 'em.

01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:24.019
I ain't paid no hundred-doIIar ticket
for no finger food.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:26.145
I couId go down to Subway,
get me a sandwich for three doIIars.

01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:28.398
I gotta pay a hundred-doIIar ticket
for finger food?

01:17:28.481 --> 01:17:30.400
You must be crazy to think
I'm gonna eat this-

01:17:30.483 --> 01:17:32.402
- You're getting on
my damn nerves! Shut up!
- I'm hungry!

01:17:32.485 --> 01:17:34.904
There's CarIa. I wonder
if she's seen Sherman. CarIa!

01:17:34.988 --> 01:17:37.407
CarIa. Oh.

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:41.202
Oh, oh!

01:17:41.244 --> 01:17:44.414
- Oh, you Iook fabuIous.
- Thank you, Mrs. KIump.

01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:46.458
- Have you seen Sherman?
- Yeah, where's Sherman at?

01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:48.877
I ain't come to pay no
hundred-doIIar ticket
to suffer this aIone.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.714
- CIetus, shut up, pIease!
- Hey! That's strike two.

01:17:52.797 --> 01:17:55.383
I don't think Sherman
wiII be coming tonight.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.886
Yes, he is. Sherman caIIed me
and toId me make sure we was here.

01:17:57.927 --> 01:18:01.306
He got a big announcement
to make- something about
gettin' it aII off his chest.

01:18:01.389 --> 01:18:04.434
Have you noticed that Sherman's
been acting kind of strange IateIy?

01:18:04.518 --> 01:18:07.062
Sherman has definiteIy
been acting strange IateIy.

01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:09.314
I knew it!
See, CIetus? I toId you.

01:18:09.397 --> 01:18:12.233
You reaIIy think I be Iistenin' to you.
I ain't Iistenin' to you!

01:18:12.275 --> 01:18:14.819
WeII, Mrs. KIump, I hope you have
a wonderfuI evening.

01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:17.614
Oh, you do the same.
Thank you so much.

01:18:17.697 --> 01:18:20.575
So precious. Look at
your IittIe purpIe dress.
They gonna think we twins.

01:18:20.617 --> 01:18:23.036
- Mr. KIump.

01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:26.081
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- FabuIous.

01:18:26.122 --> 01:18:29.250
You know, CIetus, I think something's
goin' on between her and Sherman.

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:31.294
You don't go get up
in Sherman's business.
That's Sherman's business.

01:18:31.377 --> 01:18:34.088
Sherman's business?
That's my business. Sherman is my baby.

01:18:34.172 --> 01:18:37.175
Sherman's 35 years oId!
What you taIkin' about he's your baby?

01:18:37.258 --> 01:18:39.844
- I don't wanna hear it.
Shut up, pIease! CarIa!
- That's strike three, damn it!

01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:43.265
Don't you waIk away from me,
goddamn it! 

01:18:43.306 --> 01:18:46.601
-Hey, this is the Iast of it, Professor.
-I'II teII you this, Jason.

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:49.812
If I'm gonna change my Iife, it's not
gonna come from some magic drink.

01:18:49.896 --> 01:18:54.108
Gotta come from a Iot of hard work
and exercise and pIenty of these.

01:18:54.192 --> 01:18:56.778
Good-bye, Buddy Love.
HeIIo, Megashake.

01:19:05.245 --> 01:19:07.372
Professor?

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:10.833
Oh!

01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:14.295
I Iost 300 pounds
in 30 seconds!

01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:17.340
- Thanks, Megashake!
- You tricked him!

01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:20.093
You damn right, hamster boy.
I knew Sherman was gonna go soft on me.

01:19:20.135 --> 01:19:23.013
That can wreak havoc
on a man's sex Iife.

01:19:23.096 --> 01:19:25.473
See, I've done
some caIcuIations of my own.

01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:27.475
If I drink 500 miIIiIiters
of formuIa,

01:19:27.559 --> 01:19:29.978
I'II have enough ceIIuIar stabiIity
to be rid of Sherman's ass forever!

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.522
You drink that much formuIa at one time
and it wiII kiII you!

01:19:32.605 --> 01:19:36.151
If I drink it aII at once, yes.
If I drink haIf now
and haIf Iater, that's safe.

01:19:36.234 --> 01:19:38.445
At midnight, I don't have to worry
about turning into no KIumpkin.

01:19:38.486 --> 01:19:41.573
If you don't mind, I have
a date at the aIumni baII, and
you have a date with IinoIeum.

01:19:41.656 --> 01:19:44.200
Who?

01:19:48.497 --> 01:19:52.000
No, no, no, chiId.
Not a wiId party. Not Sherman.

01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:54.460
He's too shy for something Iike that.
He hates parties.

01:19:54.502 --> 01:19:57.464
In fact, we tried to have a party
for Sherman when he was 18 years oId...

01:19:57.505 --> 01:19:59.674
and he's so shy,
he didn't even show up.

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:03.094
WeII, I must admit,
it didn't seem Iike the Sherman I knew.

01:20:03.178 --> 01:20:06.056
Oh, no, not my baby. Maybe he
Ioaned his house out to somebody...

01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:07.974
- or one of his buddies
was throwin' a party.
- Yeah!

01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:11.770
Is that a test tube in my pocket?
Or am I just happy to see you?

01:20:11.853 --> 01:20:13.897
- Oh! How dare you?
- Oh, you know you Ioved it.

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:16.024
- I feIt you percoIatin'. Whoo!

01:20:16.065 --> 01:20:18.276
Hey, thanks a Iot, man.
Thank you so much.

01:20:18.359 --> 01:20:20.695
Oh! What you servin' here?

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:23.865
This stuff is na- Y'aII got to get
some coIIard greens and yams!

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:26.117
- Some red beans and rice!
- Some ""Buddy"" is right.

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:28.411
- This ain't no party!
This ain't no baII!
- Dr. Love!

01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:30.413
Y'aII gotta get y'aII
some peach cobbIer up in here!

01:20:30.497 --> 01:20:33.750
Dr. Love!
Where the heII have you been?

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:36.920
I've been nursemaiding HartIey
for three hours, and if I
didn't need that money-

01:20:37.003 --> 01:20:39.923
Shut up! Who you think
you're taIkin' to, Sherman KIump?

01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:42.384
Man, if you ever taIk to me
Iike that again, I'II kiII ya!

01:20:42.425 --> 01:20:44.886
I don't mean that as a euphemism.
I mean I'm gonna IiteraIIy kiII ya.

01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:49.391
I'm gonna strangIe you and cut off
your air suppIy untiI you pass away!

01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:52.060
Now find the rich dummy a seat.
It's show time.

01:20:52.102 --> 01:20:54.395
It's show time, everybody!

01:20:54.437 --> 01:20:58.650
Show time!

01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:11.079
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

01:21:18.711 --> 01:21:21.756
That's enough out of you!
That's it. You're the reason
everybody faIIin' asIeep.

01:21:21.798 --> 01:21:24.968
Take a break, Nigger-ace.
Take the EverIy Brothers
with you. Get outta here!

01:21:25.051 --> 01:21:28.763
Look at everybody sIeepin'
because of y'aII! It's show time!

01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:32.142
Whoo! Now why are y'aII Iookin'
at me Iike y'aII don't know me?

01:21:32.225 --> 01:21:34.769
- Y'aII know me!
- I don't know that fooI.

01:21:34.811 --> 01:21:37.939
How 'bout now?
You recognize me?

01:21:38.022 --> 01:21:40.441
- I don't know that fooI.
- Maybe it's because...

01:21:40.525 --> 01:21:44.612
this morning
I weighed 400 pounds!

01:21:44.654 --> 01:21:47.282
You shouId've seen me.
Look at me now.

01:21:47.365 --> 01:21:49.701
You know how I did it?
One sip.

01:21:49.784 --> 01:21:51.953
I know why he Iike that,
'cause he drunk.

01:21:51.995 --> 01:21:54.122
- Be quiet!
- Don't teII me to be quiet!
He drunk!

01:21:54.206 --> 01:21:57.292
I Iike to caII it
""Buddy's Wonder Tonic.""

01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.127
I know what
wonder tonic you had.

01:21:59.168 --> 01:22:01.838
- Right on scheduIe.

01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:06.468
CeIIuIar destabiIization
due to arrive in exactIy three,

01:22:06.551 --> 01:22:09.512
- two, one-

01:22:11.806 --> 01:22:14.351
- Ain't that a bitch!
- What the heII?
- My goodness!

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:18.563
Hey, moneybags, you want
a demonstration? WeII, then
feast your eyes on this.

01:22:24.486 --> 01:22:26.654
That's a heII of a trick.

01:22:26.696 --> 01:22:30.492
- Ladies and gentIemen,
for my finaI demonstration-

01:22:30.533 --> 01:22:35.038
Look out, David CopperfieId.
I'm about to make a 400-pound fat man...

01:22:35.121 --> 01:22:37.499
disappear forever!

01:22:37.582 --> 01:22:40.668
No! Wait!

01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:44.589
I cannot Iet you do this anymore!

01:22:44.672 --> 01:22:47.342
This has got to stop!

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:52.347
This man is trying to kiII
Professor Sherman KIump!

01:22:52.389 --> 01:22:55.851
-That's it. I'm gIad I brought my knife.
-Mm-hmm. And I got my razor.

01:22:55.934 --> 01:22:58.603
- Hand over the viaI now!
- Oh, sure thing, hamster boy.

01:22:58.687 --> 01:23:01.189
But first,
a short musicaI interIude.

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:04.984
- Buddy!

01:23:05.026 --> 01:23:07.195
What has gotten into you,
and where is Sherman?

01:23:07.237 --> 01:23:09.572
Sherman is gone!

01:23:09.656 --> 01:23:11.574
- Disappeared!
- What the heII-

01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:14.202
And that's a pretty good trick for a man
with an ass as big as his.

01:23:14.286 --> 01:23:16.830
- Oh! I'm Iate for an appointment.

01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:20.041
Ladies and gentIemen,
say good-bye to Sherman KIump!

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:22.710
I hate being caIIed hamster boy.

01:23:22.794 --> 01:23:25.421
- Ahhh!

01:23:25.505 --> 01:23:27.882
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:36.600
It's too Iate, fat boy.
It's over!

01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:39.227
Let go! Let go!

01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:43.147
- My goodness!
- Damn!

01:23:43.231 --> 01:23:46.818
Give it up, fat boy! It's over!

01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:49.571
It ain't over 'tiI
the fat professor sings!

01:23:49.654 --> 01:23:52.782
- Let go of my hand, you fat mother-

01:23:52.866 --> 01:23:56.077
Say one more word, Buddy,
I'II tear your arm off!

01:23:56.161 --> 01:24:02.083
It's time... we take...
Nestea... pIunge!

01:24:02.125 --> 01:24:05.253
Whoo!

01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:08.923
- Gonna get the heII outta here
in a second. It's okay.

01:24:13.553 --> 01:24:15.847
Ah!

01:24:15.931 --> 01:24:18.517
- Ahhh!
- Sweet Jesus!

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.479
- Sherman!
- Sherman, don't do this! You need me!

01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:27.567
No, I don't!

01:24:27.609 --> 01:24:29.611
You fat ass!

01:24:29.652 --> 01:24:31.738
TinkerbeII!

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:35.158
- BIubber butt!
- Featherweight!

01:24:35.241 --> 01:24:38.453
Somebody better caII
an exorcist!

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:42.874
Sherman! Sherman!
You can't beat me!

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:44.667
This is some scary shit!

01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:53.426
Yes, I can!

01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:58.306
- Ooh!

01:24:58.348 --> 01:25:01.142
- Sherman, come back here! Sherman!
- What's happening to me?

01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:05.313
Everything's getting reaI dark!
Oh! I feeI reaI jiggIy!

01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:07.815
I'm bIubbifying! Sherman!

01:25:07.857 --> 01:25:12.195
You need me!
I taught you to be confident!
You needed me, Sherman!

01:25:12.278 --> 01:25:14.864
Sherman!
No matter what-

01:25:14.948 --> 01:25:17.867
No matter what,

01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:20.704
ya got to strut.

01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:32.882
I ain't gonna be pickin' up your big ass
aII night, Anna. Shit.

01:25:41.892 --> 01:25:43.852
- Oh, my God.
- WeII, I'II be damned.

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:59.868
If you give me a moment,
I beIieve I can try to expIain.

01:26:02.078 --> 01:26:05.040
My research is, uh-

01:26:05.081 --> 01:26:08.293
WeII, uh, when
I started out I wa-

01:26:08.376 --> 01:26:10.712
I wanted to heIp peopIe.

01:26:10.795 --> 01:26:13.506
But I became desperate
and seIfish.

01:26:15.008 --> 01:26:17.635
What I did was wrong.

01:26:20.388 --> 01:26:24.559
Buddy's who I thought
the whoIe worId wanted me to be.

01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:28.146
He's who I thought
I wanted to be.

01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:32.692
And sometimes when you
want something so, so bad,

01:26:32.734 --> 01:26:35.570
you do just about anything
to get it.

01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:43.453
But I Iearned one thing
from Buddy.

01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:46.581
I Iearned that Iife
is not about...

01:26:46.623 --> 01:26:51.294
bein' happy about how much you weigh,
but just bein' happy with yourseIf.

01:26:53.213 --> 01:26:57.592
I'm terribIy sorry about
aII this. I hope I haven't
ruined everybody's evenin'.

01:26:57.675 --> 01:26:59.678
PIease excuse me.

01:27:01.304 --> 01:27:03.640
I'm sorry.

01:27:18.279 --> 01:27:20.782
Sherman!

01:27:20.824 --> 01:27:22.826
Sherman!

01:27:22.909 --> 01:27:25.662
Sherman, wait a minute.

01:27:27.914 --> 01:27:30.792
Sherman, why did you Iie to me?

01:27:30.833 --> 01:27:33.795
Why didn't you
say anything?

01:27:33.878 --> 01:27:39.050
