01:28.522 --> 01:30.658
I'm okay.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.295
I'm okay.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.769
Yes, yes.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.772
Woo!

01:44.872 --> 01:49.810
Yes.

01:49.910 --> 01:56.450
Log 0000100, landing was a success.

01:56.550 --> 02:01.155
Initial impression of the land,
beautiful.

02:01.255 --> 02:05.659
Well, if not beautiful, then practical.

02:05.759 --> 02:11.031
Still awaiting an earthly
encounter, maybe Bon Jovi,

02:11.131 --> 02:15.469
Danny DeVito, or a New Jersey housewife,

02:15.569 --> 02:19.973
or the other extraterrestrial, Snooki.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.645
Standby for further updates.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.387
The map says I'm here, but...

02:33.487 --> 02:35.323
I feel like there's some
false advertising

02:35.423 --> 02:37.391
on the account of this postcard.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.036
Nope.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.715
Hello, earth lady.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.641
And I'm bored.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.511
Hello?

04:39.447 --> 04:40.448
Hello?

05:13.981 --> 05:14.982
Hello?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.651
Hello?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.420
Maybe dad was right,

05:52.520 --> 05:55.856
"It won't be what you expected, son,
I assure you of that."

05:58.859 --> 06:04.364
Hello, earthling, are you ill,
can I help you?

06:04.465 --> 06:06.767
Hello, earthling, my name is Ijo Sudin

06:06.867 --> 06:08.035
from the planet Sedna

06:08.135 --> 06:10.538
which is the furthest from
your sun in the solar system.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.705
I have traveled many light years

06:11.805 --> 06:13.273
to follow my passion for your planet

06:13.373 --> 06:14.875
and it brings me great pleasure to...

06:19.146 --> 06:20.948
Are you hungry?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.551
I haven't read anything
about this being a cure,

06:23.651 --> 06:26.554
but if this helps your illness,

06:26.654 --> 06:29.389
you're welcome to my hand

06:29.490 --> 06:32.392
as long as I can ask you
some questions afterwards.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.415
Oh, man!

06:55.516 --> 06:57.918
This is some serious strange behavior.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.254
This is unlike anything I ever
heard about your species.

07:01.354 --> 07:05.626
Can you speak, do you have a name?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.761
What the hell is going on?

07:07.861 --> 07:11.799
Earthling, are you mentally insane?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.433
You're trying to eat me.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.769
Oh god.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.110
Get up.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.459
What the heck are you?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.795
My name is Ijo Sudin
from the planet Sedna

07:41.895 --> 07:44.798
which is the furthest from
your sun in the solar system.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.466
I've traveled many light years

07:46.567 --> 07:47.968
to follow my passion for your planet

07:48.068 --> 07:49.469
and it brings me great pleasure to...

07:49.570 --> 07:51.839
Wait, wait, stop.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.006
My planet?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.542
Yes, your planet.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.475
Impossible.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.377
Possible.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.980
Are you going to eat my hand as well?

08:00.080 --> 08:04.518
You've spoken to me unlike
those other deranged specimen.

08:04.618 --> 08:09.189
I suppose I could allow you my hand.

08:09.289 --> 08:13.493
No, thanks, maybe later.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.163
I'll save it for you then.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.196
So, you're like an alien or something?

08:53.734 --> 08:57.537
Alien is a derogatory way of saying it.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.873
Imagine someone from your
south being called a redneck

08:59.973 --> 09:02.576
or one of your African-Americans
being called a...

09:02.676 --> 09:06.046
Okay, I get it, sorry,
then what are you?

09:06.146 --> 09:08.882
I am an extraterrestrial life form,

09:08.982 --> 09:12.419
a very confused
extraterrestrial life form.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.721
Me too.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.889
You're an extraterrestrial
life form, too?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.557
No, confused.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.726
Why?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.729
I never met an extraterrestrial before.

09:21.829 --> 09:22.562
Can you die?

09:22.663 --> 09:23.764
Yes.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.065
Do you have a spaceship?

09:25.165 --> 09:25.899
Yes.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.900
Where?

09:36.443 --> 09:37.577
I don't see it.

09:37.678 --> 09:41.081
It's invisible.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.983
Why do you look human?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.752
Why do you look Sednian?

09:44.852 --> 09:47.254
Fair enough.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.455
You have great hair.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.459
I know, but are you still sick
like the last earthling?

09:52.559 --> 09:56.129
I'm not sick and neither
was that guy, he's dead.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.631
Dead, impossible.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.932
Possible.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.333
My books say differently,

10:00.433 --> 10:01.935
that the dead don't come back to life

10:02.035 --> 10:03.671
and they don't eat each other.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.438
My books say you should
be a little green man

10:05.538 --> 10:07.274
with a giant head and bug eyes.

10:07.374 --> 10:11.444
You are a very offensive,
little earthling.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.512
We've been looking for her.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.616
Who?

10:16.717 --> 10:21.454
Fantastic, another earthling
and it's a female.

10:21.554 --> 10:24.291
Maybe one a little less
sick than the others.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.794
Wait, you shouldn't go towards here.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.861
Nonsense.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.131
I wish to interact with as
many earthlings as I can

10:31.231 --> 10:32.632
especially the females.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.302
She's not the type of
girl you wanna play with.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.341
See, she is much more welcoming

10:41.441 --> 10:43.210
than you and the other gentleman,

10:43.310 --> 10:45.212
this one is offering a hug.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.981
Hello, earthling, my name is Ijo Sudin

10:48.081 --> 10:49.149
from the planet Sedna

10:50.350 --> 10:51.318
which is the furthest from
your sun in the solar system.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.820
I've traveled many light years to...

10:55.088 --> 10:59.159
Owiplock was right,
earth girls are easy.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.560
You think she's ready for intercourse?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.663
Ew, no, get away from her,
it's another dead one.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.333
Get her off, get her off.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.172
Why do you keep doing that
to these earthlings, earthling?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.708
I don't want to, you keep making me.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.178
I told you they're dead and
stop calling me earthling,

11:18.278 --> 11:19.012
it's Parker.

11:19.112 --> 11:19.847
Parker?

11:19.947 --> 11:22.349
Parker.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.517
Ijo Sudin.

11:24.617 --> 11:29.089
I'll never get that, Joe.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.193
Joe.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.228
Dead.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.563
Dead.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.065
No longer alive?

11:38.165 --> 11:39.066
Right.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.042
♪ This little light of mine ♪

11:49.142 --> 11:51.745
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

11:51.845 --> 11:54.381
♪ This little light of mine ♪

11:54.481 --> 11:56.616

11:56.716 --> 11:58.051
♪ Let it shine ♪

11:58.151 --> 11:59.119

11:59.219 --> 12:02.722
♪ Let it shine ♪

12:02.823 --> 12:06.093
Bye, Jess.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.294
Do you know her?

12:07.394 --> 12:10.063
Yeah, but not anymore.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.565
Did I land in heaven?

12:12.665 --> 12:14.301
Furthest thing from it.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.735
What happened here?

12:15.836 --> 12:19.973
The apocalypse, the end of the world.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.241
How can that be?

12:21.341 --> 12:24.244
What about all the shops and the stores?

12:24.344 --> 12:30.117
And the movies, the music,
all that great music,

12:30.217 --> 12:32.585
Horton Heat and Social D,

12:32.685 --> 12:36.089
and food, do they still
make Oatmeal Creme Pies?

12:36.189 --> 12:42.095
No, no, don't tell me,
I don't wanna know.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.931
And coffee.

12:44.031 --> 12:47.634
I wanted real earth coffee

12:47.734 --> 12:50.603
and to taste a street vendor hot dog,

12:50.703 --> 12:55.508
greasy and delicious,

12:55.608 --> 12:58.445
but all I'm surrounded by

12:58.545 --> 13:01.448
is you and the dead.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.121
Oh, no.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.858
Are these your loved ones?

13:10.958 --> 13:13.126
Parker, wait, please, stop.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.361
Why are you here?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.528
It's my spring break

13:15.628 --> 13:16.864
and father said it was finally time

13:16.964 --> 13:19.967
for me to experience
the earthlings firsthand.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.335
I've always been so
fascinated with your species,

13:22.435 --> 13:26.139
but what's the point if you're all dead?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.375
If this is, what was that word again?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.309
The apocalypse.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.478
Yes, the apocalypse.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.645
Why am I here?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.214
I don't know why you're here.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.517
Life is like a comic book now,
I miss the Flash.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.685
Who's the Flash?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.988
He's a superhero with super speed,

13:41.088 --> 13:42.522
so he can run really fast,

13:42.622 --> 13:44.992
like he can break the laws of physics.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.559
Is he here?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.528
No, he's make-believe.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.363
You don't know what comic books are?

13:50.463 --> 13:51.664
I'm afraid not.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.566
They're books made up from imagination,

13:53.666 --> 13:55.502
like how the dead come back to life.

13:55.602 --> 13:59.006
At one time, that was make-believe,
but now it's real,

13:59.106 --> 14:02.009
and you, you're supposed
to be make-believe, too.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.345
I'm sorry I'm not make-believe
or the Flash.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.880
I don't mean to offend,

14:06.980 --> 14:09.382
are there any other earthlings
like you left?

14:13.586 --> 14:15.388
There is some, not many,

14:15.488 --> 14:16.856
at least I don't think there are.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.859
A young female earthling.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.362
I apologize about what I said before,

14:22.462 --> 14:24.097
I am sure you are not easy.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.099
Gee, thanks.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.102
Look, it sounds like you came here
to learn more about us,

14:29.202 --> 14:32.572
not attack us like in
Independence Day or something.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.707
You thought we were going to attack?

14:34.807 --> 14:36.576
Yeah, I used to play
in the yard for hours

14:36.676 --> 14:38.711
pretending to kill aliens.

14:38.811 --> 14:43.416
Oh, right, bad word, anyway,
maybe that's why I'm alive.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.884
I guess you should've
come here a year ago

14:44.985 --> 14:47.254
when things were still normal.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.555
How did this happen?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.558
I don't know, something
about a new chemical virus.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.061
When people started dying
and coming back to life,

14:54.161 --> 14:55.762
it kinda stopped mattering
what caused it.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.064
Well, where did it come from?

14:57.164 --> 14:57.897
I don't know.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.066
What was the chemical virus?

14:59.166 --> 15:00.067
Well, how do I find out?

15:00.167 --> 15:02.635
I don't freaking know.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.737
Sorry, sorry.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.806
All I know is that I have to survive,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.408
that's what my dad told me.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.411
Go home, Joe, I'm sure
it's a much better place.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.798
All right then, what's your name?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.266
Thanks.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.270
It's okay, Dad, I'll get you some water.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.673
Mom, do you want some?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.777
Look, they're airing it.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.846
We are now getting confirmation
from the CDC

15:46.946 --> 15:48.948
that the outbreaks of violence
in New York City

15:49.049 --> 15:51.351
are connected to the
mysterious blue smoke

15:51.451 --> 15:52.619
we've been telling you about

15:52.719 --> 15:55.355
since it was first spotted
earlier today.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.624
There are multiple reports
of people caught

15:57.724 --> 16:01.328
within the blue smoke,
losing all cognitive ability,

16:01.428 --> 16:03.463
effectively dying instantly,

16:03.563 --> 16:06.466
and then apparently
regaining consciousness

16:06.566 --> 16:08.535
and attacking those around them.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.370
Officials believe the smoke is carrying

16:10.470 --> 16:13.340
some sort of virus and
everyone is urged to...

16:13.440 --> 16:14.707
Is that what you saw, dad?

16:14.807 --> 16:18.045
Can't tell, we were
blocks away from there.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.647
But you and mom aren't gonna die, right?

16:20.747 --> 16:24.151
Listen, you two, listen, listen.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.654
Listen, stay back, stay back,

16:27.754 --> 16:32.325
this is gonna get worse.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.994
I need you guys to survive, okay?

16:35.095 --> 16:38.498
Just take care of each other,
do it for us, okay?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.839
You'll survive, okay?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.848
I'm so sorry.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.018
Parker, I just saw you, your...

16:59.119 --> 17:02.389
Parker?

17:02.489 --> 17:05.392
Parker?

17:05.492 --> 17:08.528
Where'd you go?

17:08.627 --> 17:09.529
Hello?

17:16.035 --> 17:19.539
Parker, Parker!

17:19.638 --> 17:21.074
What is the CDC?

17:21.174 --> 17:22.375
I have no idea.

17:22.474 --> 17:24.243
What's something that
attracts the zombies?

17:24.344 --> 17:28.548
Loud noises.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.583
Are you crazy?

17:30.683 --> 17:34.087
Oh, perfect, if only I could
just get up there.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.058
Great, now he got in.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.627
Oh, okay.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.397
Take this, if you get into trouble,
just push the button.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.565
Are you gonna tell me what you're doing

17:45.665 --> 17:48.235
or just let Mr. Hungry
eat your good hand?

17:51.804 --> 17:53.072
What's today's date?

17:53.173 --> 17:56.743
October 31, 2014, why?

17:56.843 --> 17:59.246
I think I figured out a way to fix this,

17:59.346 --> 18:01.248
I realize that now.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.091
Whoa.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.106
I figured out a way to fix this.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.730
Oh, boy.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.505
Mister.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.740
Mister.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.543
You okay?

19:36.643 --> 19:38.545
I think so.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.358
Joe?

19:51.458 --> 19:54.527
One second, I'll be right back.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.264
Yes, Parker, what is it,
are you in danger?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.366
No, but where did you go?

19:59.466 --> 20:02.034
Mister, can I have my hand back?

20:02.134 --> 20:04.704
Hang on, I'll ask.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.072
What's today's date?

20:06.172 --> 20:08.107
December 8th.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.576
Can I have my hand back?

20:09.676 --> 20:10.877
What year is it?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.545
You sure you okay?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.381
Yes, I am.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.215
What's the year.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.052
It worked.

20:20.152 --> 20:23.623
I am in the year 2013.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.557
No way.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.958
Way.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.227
What the fuck are you doing?

20:28.328 --> 20:32.231
Excuse me, I'm talking to
a 12 year old in my mind.

20:32.332 --> 20:36.102
She's in the future,
approximately a year from now.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.938
We're trying to stop
the end of the world.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.975
You've served your purpose,
earthling, thank you.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.977
I hope you don't die.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.919
I'm back, Parker.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.654
How did you travel through time?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.289
Has your species discovered

20:56.389 --> 20:58.758
that time operates on
zero rap principle?

20:58.858 --> 21:00.092
Who said what?

21:00.192 --> 21:02.261
Let's just say it was magic then.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.263
Fine, but what are you gonna do?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.432
I'm gonna find the CDC

21:05.532 --> 21:08.435
and stop your apocalypse
before it even happens.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.349
You scared the shit out of me, Sammy.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.884
Mouth, I was worried about you.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.686
I can take care of myself.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.488
All right, well, we're still family,

22:01.588 --> 22:02.655
what if I need taken care of?

22:02.755 --> 22:08.528
I guess I'll have to be there
to protect you then.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.496
What's that?

22:09.596 --> 22:10.830
A friend gave it to me.

22:10.930 --> 22:11.831
Who?

22:11.931 --> 22:15.167
Promise you'll believe me.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.669
Promise.

22:16.769 --> 22:17.837
Promise.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.539
He's an alien and he's going to save us.

22:19.639 --> 22:20.840
Okay, we need to get to the...

22:20.940 --> 22:21.841
He's real.

22:22.842 --> 22:23.676
Parker, what's real is
that Patrick is pissed

22:24.611 --> 22:25.678
you've been out here for so long, okay?

22:25.778 --> 22:28.347
I'm not even supposed to be
out here, we need to go.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.517
He's a jerk, don't you wanna be saved?

22:30.617 --> 22:33.853
Of course I do.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.022
Right now, that jerk is our only hope.

22:36.122 --> 22:39.025
Not for long, you'll see.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.733
♪ Hit me like a wrecking ball ♪

22:46.833 --> 22:48.568
Take the next one, Peaches.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.244
Hey, hey, down here.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.046
Hello.

23:00.146 --> 23:03.082
How are you today?

23:03.182 --> 23:05.752
Aye, aye, aye, watch it, watch it.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.393
What?

23:14.494 --> 23:17.730
Peaches said you acting kinda funny.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.399
Thank you, Peaches.

23:20.500 --> 23:24.971
Your shirt is very curious,
you must be intelligent.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.907
Yeah, yeah, Peaches says
that what the sign says.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.576
Yes, where I'm from,

23:29.676 --> 23:32.612
the last great chancellor
of the Delta Bavonus Council

23:32.712 --> 23:37.249
which disbanded in 1238944

23:37.349 --> 23:39.318
passed, ordained, and made law

23:39.418 --> 23:42.254
that yellow is the color of genius.

23:42.354 --> 23:46.092
He was very strange,
always passing silly little laws.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.260
Well, me and Peaches,
we just like yellow,

23:48.360 --> 23:49.929
we kinda partial to it.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.264
It was a birthday present,
Peaches bought it for me,

23:52.364 --> 23:53.265
ain't that right, Peaches?

23:54.333 --> 23:55.935
Yes, the day marked to
commemorate and celebrate

23:56.035 --> 23:59.939
the beginning of something,
in this case, your birthday.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.108
Yeah, yeah, yeah, birthday.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.276
Do you happen to know where I can find

24:04.376 --> 24:07.446
the summation of this
planets wealth of knowledge?

24:07.547 --> 24:10.617
A collection of a database
of information?

24:10.717 --> 24:11.951
What?

24:12.051 --> 24:12.985
Does he mean library?

24:13.085 --> 24:14.954
Peaches wanna know
if you mean a library.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.623
Yes.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.958
Yes, exactly, a library,

24:19.058 --> 24:22.294
a place set apart which contains
manuscripts and documents

24:22.394 --> 24:24.797
and other things for reading and viewing

24:24.897 --> 24:27.133
and listening and research, exactly.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.135
Do you know where I
might find such a place?

24:29.235 --> 24:32.204
Peaches, do you know where a library is?

24:32.304 --> 24:35.542
Nah.

24:39.579 --> 24:43.215
Peaches said it's right over there.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.017
See, that's why we don't
smoke crack, Peaches.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.687
That's what happens,
that's a crack baby.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.690
Excuse me, sir.

25:23.790 --> 25:24.691
Never interrupt a man

25:24.791 --> 25:27.526
while he's drinking his morning coffee.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.529
Oh, coffee, can I have a taste?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.870
None left.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.706
How can I help you?

25:39.806 --> 25:41.207
I was hoping you could point me

25:41.307 --> 25:42.742
in the direction of some resources,

25:42.842 --> 25:45.377
so I can discern what the CDC is.

25:45.477 --> 25:48.581
The Center for Disease Control.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.583
Are you sick?

25:50.683 --> 25:54.553
No, I have no illnesses
from this planet,

25:54.654 --> 25:56.055
but I was hoping for a bit more.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.289
Why the interest?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.291
Well, I heard this place was a trove

25:59.391 --> 26:02.795
of all the most important
information on the planet

26:02.895 --> 26:04.396
and well, I wanna learn.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.799
Yes, yes.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.069
Right this way for learning.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.570
To the books.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.580
Let's see.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.415
Booker.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.084
Buchanan.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.318
Butch.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.419
Seven Ways to Die,

26:27.519 --> 26:29.756
the History of the World's
Seven Worst Diseases,

26:29.856 --> 26:31.958
nope, but close.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.593
Let me see, yeah.

26:34.694 --> 26:38.097
Here we are, Burr's Guide
to Contagious Diseases.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.108
Surely, those computers
must be a more expedient way

26:49.208 --> 26:50.276
to access information.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.946
No computers, no internet,
you said you wanted to learn.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.347
The youth of this country
think they know

26:55.447 --> 26:58.117
everything about everything
because of Wikipedia,

26:58.217 --> 27:01.287
it's so wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.791
Who did that?

27:04.891 --> 27:07.459
Who shushed me in my own library?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.300
Anyway, you asked for my help,

27:14.400 --> 27:18.204
that means we do it my way.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.973
Any hooligan with a laptop
can create a website

27:21.073 --> 27:24.811
and claim his own particular
nonsense as truth,

27:24.911 --> 27:27.980
the internet is deceiving,
it should be illegal.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.650
I'll have none of that, no, thank you.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.352
I want work that was scrutinized.

27:33.452 --> 27:37.890
I want references and editors
and industry acknowledgment,

27:37.990 --> 27:39.826
not some idiot with a keyboard

27:39.926 --> 27:43.662
spouting whatever particular tomfoolery

27:43.763 --> 27:45.397
he happens to believe.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.499
Okay.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.668
Your way then.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.341
Whoa.

27:55.441 --> 28:00.012
All that learning, you must've
worked up quite an appetite.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.348
Is that what that is?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.350
I guess I did then.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.872
Nothing.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.073
Darn.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.042
How can zombies even be real?

28:30.142 --> 28:31.878
This species haven't even
accomplished xenomorphing

28:31.978 --> 28:33.913
to regrow limbs yet.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.215
And there are no known diseases

28:36.315 --> 28:38.617
even remotely close to
reanimating the dead,

28:38.717 --> 28:42.889
no parasites, no bacteria,
no viruses, nothing.

28:42.989 --> 28:46.125
Zombies?

28:46.225 --> 28:49.228
Did you just say zombies?

28:49.328 --> 28:50.229
Yes.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.810
How did you learn to read like that?

29:03.910 --> 29:05.744
That is incredible.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.915
I've seen NASCAR drivers take
turns slower than you read.

29:09.015 --> 29:11.918
Does not everyone read
at 68 pages a minute?

29:12.018 --> 29:14.921
Ha, we're lucky if 68 people
can read anymore.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.923
People read about fiction
all the time now,

29:17.023 --> 29:20.126
like your zombies, that's
make-believe, my friend,

29:20.226 --> 29:23.295
pure fiction, you should've
said that when you walked in,

29:23.395 --> 29:25.597
I would've directed you
to the kiddie section

29:25.697 --> 29:27.633
where you can read all about ghosts,

29:27.733 --> 29:30.302
goblins, and bears, oh my.

29:30.402 --> 29:31.971
Well, actually, today is...

29:32.071 --> 29:33.605
Oh, I'll tell you what today is,

29:33.705 --> 29:36.175
today is the day you learn
about the real world,

29:36.275 --> 29:38.777
you wanna know what's real?

29:38.878 --> 29:42.448
Okay.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.317
Aliens.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.320
Little green men.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.457
Now, there's something
you can learn about,

29:51.557 --> 29:53.860
I can get you tons of books about...

29:53.960 --> 29:56.295
Well, wait, now, I don't
need those books.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.463
Why not?

29:57.563 --> 29:58.697
Well, because...

29:59.932 --> 30:03.802
You're an older gentleman
who's already read about them,

30:03.903 --> 30:07.306
I bet you read all about Roswell,
Area 51, and more,

30:07.406 --> 30:08.640
right, am I right?

30:08.740 --> 30:11.143
I do know a great deal about aliens,

30:11.243 --> 30:15.047
but let's just say zombies are real,

30:15.147 --> 30:16.315
how can I read about that?

30:16.415 --> 30:21.520
Persistent about those zombies.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.322
Nothing from this planet

30:23.422 --> 30:28.160
can make the dead come back to life.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.996
Unless...

30:30.096 --> 30:30.829
What?

30:30.930 --> 30:32.331
Unless it was them.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.906
Oh, there's no way you're still...

30:44.610 --> 30:45.677
Are you okay, buddy?

30:45.777 --> 30:47.346
What the?

30:47.446 --> 30:48.580
Who are you?

30:48.680 --> 30:53.385
I demand to know who you are
and what I am doing here.

30:59.125 --> 31:02.028
I demand to know who you are.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.609
Oh, that stinks.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.948
Oh, that burns.

31:22.048 --> 31:26.618
Parker?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.288
Where is that earthling?

31:51.243 --> 31:52.444
Joe, if you're back,

31:52.544 --> 31:54.913
I'm in the room with the big door
at the end of the tunnel.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.415
Find me.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.102
Ew.

32:16.202 --> 32:18.470
Come on.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.438
Just eat it.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.441
Two of you should move
to the second floor.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.814
She's just a kid, okay?

32:28.914 --> 32:31.617
She's a brat and she needs
to learn a lesson.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.619
I'll talk to her.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.803
Parker!

32:51.903 --> 32:55.174
Don't move.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.309
Who are you?

32:57.409 --> 32:58.877
Who are you?

32:58.977 --> 33:01.980
I'm the one with the gun.

33:02.081 --> 33:07.153
Can I put my hands down,
Mr. The One with the Gun?

33:10.156 --> 33:13.892
Okay, then.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.527
Hello.

33:15.627 --> 33:19.231
Earth...

33:19.331 --> 33:25.071
I stumbled upon this place
looking for earthlings,

33:25.171 --> 33:28.340
people, I'm looking for people.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.176
You need to keep looking.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.844
No.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.214
He's my friend, he wants to help.

33:35.314 --> 33:39.085
Sammy, control her before I have to.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.752
Control yourself, baldy.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.355
He's my friend and he wants to help.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.091
Give her a break, Patrick.

33:45.191 --> 33:47.926
We haven't seen anyone in so long.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.029
Maybe he could tell us
about the outside world.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.598
There's nothing out there.

33:52.698 --> 33:56.602
If you're so curious, take
your friend and leave.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.873
This group has all the members
it needs to survive.

34:01.973 --> 34:04.410
You won't jeopardize us any further.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.879
I didn't mean to bring any harm
to you or your group.

34:07.979 --> 34:11.382
I wanna help this world
and I think I can.

34:11.483 --> 34:16.755
Why do you keep talking like that?

34:16.855 --> 34:18.224
You led 'em right to us.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.569
Stay here.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.780
What the hell did you do?

35:27.526 --> 35:30.696
Why aren't you scared?

35:30.796 --> 35:32.698
Should I be?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.304
Both of you leave.

35:38.404 --> 35:42.808
No, it wasn't their fault, I'll leave.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.194
Wait, Joe, wait, did you find anything?

36:02.294 --> 36:03.495
I learned about the CDC,

36:03.595 --> 36:05.331
but nothing that would lead to this.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.333
I need to go back.

36:12.238 --> 36:15.741
Who the hell are you?

36:15.841 --> 36:20.712
Parker, is this one of the females
that I can play with?

36:20.812 --> 36:22.214
What, no, she's my sister.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.516
Okay, you're not playing
with anybody, okay?

36:24.616 --> 36:29.054
Least of all me, now tell me
who you are.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.022
I'm Ijo Sudin from the planet Sedna

36:31.122 --> 36:34.025
which is the furthest from
your sun in the solar system.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.194
I came here to follow my passion

36:36.295 --> 36:38.530
for the planet that I so dearly loved.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.598
Never in a million years

36:39.698 --> 36:41.567
did I think I would find it like this.

36:41.667 --> 36:45.271
This is not the world that
I fell in love with as a child.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.540
Father let me follow my passion
and come here,

36:48.640 --> 36:50.442
now I know,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.779
this planet is nearly lost.

36:53.879 --> 36:58.284
Okay, crazy, sorry to have
bothered you, let's go.

36:58.384 --> 37:01.086
Show her, Joe, disappear,
prove it to her.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.889
Please give him a chance to prove it.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.391
Fine, prove it.

37:05.491 --> 37:06.792
Show her the time travel trick.

37:06.892 --> 37:07.893
What the fuck?

37:07.993 --> 37:09.461
Mouth.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.963
First, zombies, and then aliens.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.565
Mouth.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.733
I didn't curse.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.234
Alien is a bad word.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.437
Time travel is very real.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.071
On my planet, it's a technique

37:20.171 --> 37:22.741
learned from experience and time.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.910
I'd only started learning it
before I left

37:25.010 --> 37:27.979
and it was never meant
to be used on the dead,

37:28.079 --> 37:30.816
a living host gives me
much more direction,

37:30.916 --> 37:33.952
but can be very risky.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.922
Using a zombie is like
driving a car backwards

37:37.022 --> 37:39.591
while on fire over a cliff,

37:39.691 --> 37:43.829
I can get the time down,
but not the location.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.433
Okay, then why not use a living host?

37:47.533 --> 37:51.437
Sammy, you are very beautiful,

37:51.537 --> 37:53.605
but did you just hear what I said?

37:53.705 --> 37:54.940
Whatever.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.608
Can all your people do this?

37:56.708 --> 37:57.443
No.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.778
See, he's special, I wanna help.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.112
I can't let you do that.

38:01.212 --> 38:05.150
If I use a living person,
they may not make it back.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.454
Is this how you can die?

38:08.554 --> 38:10.789
Take good care of her.

38:10.889 --> 38:15.627
Will do.

38:15.727 --> 38:16.628
Okay, let him go.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.129
But he can die.

38:23.969 --> 38:24.970
Told ya.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.363
Oh, that hurt.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.364
Are you okay?

38:52.464 --> 38:53.832
What the hell happened?

38:53.932 --> 38:56.668
Oh, no, bad idea to use a zombie.

38:56.768 --> 38:59.405
I think that's rule seven or something,

38:59.505 --> 39:02.340
but it wasn't even in the damn class,
it should've been.

39:02.441 --> 39:06.845
It must rapidly increase decomposition.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.014
I'm fine, I'm fine, thank you.

39:09.114 --> 39:12.017
It be so much better to use the living,

39:12.117 --> 39:15.921
it's too risky, I didn't even
pass the damn class.

39:16.021 --> 39:19.525
I can hear dad now, "Ijo Sudin,
if you take your head

39:19.625 --> 39:22.027
out of those damn earth tour
books, you'd pass your exam."

39:22.127 --> 39:24.396
"Can someone just tell me
what the hell is going on?"

39:24.496 --> 39:27.032
We told you, Joe's
a time traveling alien

39:27.132 --> 39:29.200
from the planet Sedna
here to visit earth

39:29.300 --> 39:34.773
on his spring break.

39:34.873 --> 39:39.277
You got some fight in ya,
here we go, cowabunga.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.550
Okay, that was cool.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.290
Throw them both in with the rest.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.280
You gotta push the button,
then you talk into it,

40:15.380 --> 40:20.418
what is this, your first day on the job?

40:20.519 --> 40:21.920
But what do I say?

40:22.020 --> 40:23.088
Well, you gotta try and figure out

40:23.188 --> 40:27.993
what the hell is going on over there.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.495
I'm too late.

40:29.595 --> 40:30.796
You think?

40:30.896 --> 40:33.264
It's like the whole city's
turned upside down.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.433
It's the apocalypse.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.768
Oh, stop with that.

40:36.868 --> 40:39.104
You're reading way too
many comic books, kid.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.972
I gotta start reading those.

40:41.072 --> 40:44.175
Well, what's today's date and the time?

40:44.275 --> 40:45.477
What's that got to do with it?

40:45.577 --> 40:47.145
The date and the time, please.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.147
All right, take it easy.

40:49.247 --> 40:52.618
It's December 9th, two o'clock.

40:52.718 --> 40:56.454
I was just here a few hours ago,
everything was fine.

40:56.555 --> 40:59.124
No kidding, it looks like
the shit hit the fan.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.526
What about my friends,

41:00.626 --> 41:03.495
the librarian and the homeless man
and Peaches?

41:03.595 --> 41:06.965
Peaches, no, it looks like
they're not gonna make it, pal.

41:07.065 --> 41:11.537
No, no, that can't be,
I won't let that happen.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.471
All right, look, I know
you're on the job and all,

41:13.572 --> 41:15.373
but it's pretty hairy over there.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.644
There's no sense you going
over there and getting killed.

41:18.744 --> 41:20.211
There's nothing you can do about it.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.981
Like you said that could be
the apocalypse right now.

41:23.081 --> 41:26.151
For me, the apocalypse
was a few minutes ago.

41:26.251 --> 41:29.988
Right now, I have to stop it.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.657
How are you gonna do that?

41:31.757 --> 41:34.192
I'm gonna...

41:34.292 --> 41:36.194
Well, I'm gonna...

41:44.169 --> 41:45.003
Rookies.

43:20.932 --> 43:23.134
Son of a bitch.

43:23.234 --> 43:25.804
He's a goddamn time traveler.

44:20.058 --> 44:22.861
Patrick, what are you doing?

44:22.961 --> 44:25.030
How do you know my name?

44:25.130 --> 44:27.833
That gun is not of earth.

44:27.933 --> 44:30.168
Not of, how do you know that?

44:30.268 --> 44:31.703
It's military grade.

44:31.803 --> 44:34.172
I asked you how you knew that.

44:34.272 --> 44:38.576
But our military are
the people of Sedna.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.845
If you know that,

44:39.945 --> 44:45.016
then you know what'll happen
if I pull this trigger.

44:45.116 --> 44:47.685
This planet has been
marked for annexation.

44:47.786 --> 44:50.188
It's off limits to all Sednians.

44:50.288 --> 44:51.757
What are you doing here?

44:51.857 --> 44:54.392
What are you talking about, annexation?

44:54.492 --> 44:57.062
I just came here on my spring break.

45:03.401 --> 45:05.536
Spring break.

45:05.636 --> 45:09.707
By the moons of Gallifon,
you're a student.

45:14.212 --> 45:16.214
How did you get here?

45:16.314 --> 45:19.250
My father works for
the transport authority.

45:19.350 --> 45:24.890
I took a transgalactic transit pod.

45:24.990 --> 45:26.892
A transit pod.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.329
Jackpot.

46:04.429 --> 46:07.265
My ticket home.

46:07.365 --> 46:09.267
Are you really Sednian?

46:09.367 --> 46:13.438
Of course I am,
I'm an agent of the empire.

46:13.538 --> 46:16.607
Need proof?

46:16.707 --> 46:19.777
I can see who you are under there.

46:19.878 --> 46:23.949
You're a special breed
of Sednian, aren't you?

46:24.049 --> 46:27.986
Your vessel may be a cop, but you...

46:28.086 --> 46:30.121
You're a bit more.

46:30.221 --> 46:32.290
Who are you?

46:32.390 --> 46:35.793
My name is Colonel Patrick Sudin.

46:35.894 --> 46:37.795
Yes.

46:37.896 --> 46:38.964
I can see by your reaction

46:39.064 --> 46:43.969
that no further introduction is needed.

46:44.069 --> 46:46.972
You dropped that device

46:47.072 --> 46:47.973
and those children.

46:48.073 --> 46:51.676
The children, they mean nothing.

46:51.776 --> 46:52.978
The resources of this planet

46:53.078 --> 46:56.481
have been claimed by the empire.

46:56.581 --> 47:00.718
My orders are to eliminate
all the opposition.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.653
My study of the human race indicates

47:02.753 --> 47:05.490
that they would forcefully resist us,

47:05.590 --> 47:07.692
that means that they have to go.

47:07.792 --> 47:10.828
Of course they would resist you,
this has to stop,

47:10.929 --> 47:12.497
it can't be the only way.

47:12.597 --> 47:17.235
This is the way of the empire,
boy, the way of our people,

47:17.335 --> 47:19.837
you should be honored to witness this.

47:19.938 --> 47:23.741
You will be here when
the armada arrives.

47:23.841 --> 47:27.745
What an honor that will be,
to bear witness.

47:31.182 --> 47:36.421
You are a disgrace to your people,
the empire needs to grow.

47:36.521 --> 47:38.756
I will find a way to stop you.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.560
You're too late, the device
you witnessed was the ninth,

47:42.660 --> 47:44.529
I dropped the first over an hour ago.

47:44.629 --> 47:45.530
You're a monster.

47:46.531 --> 47:49.234
Even your earthlings agree,
change is coming

47:49.334 --> 47:52.237
and it belongs to the Sednian empire.

47:57.408 --> 48:00.545
I see you haven't
mastered your time travel.

48:00.645 --> 48:02.047
What a pity.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.890
2:30, an hour before.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.899
Your vessel is dying,
I'll see you around.

48:25.403 --> 48:26.437
You're not gonna help pack?

48:26.537 --> 48:28.606
No.

48:28.706 --> 48:29.440
Why not?

48:30.275 --> 48:32.577
Because we shouldn't leave here.

48:32.677 --> 48:36.914
You saw what happened, it's not safe.

48:37.015 --> 48:37.915
We're leaving.

48:38.016 --> 48:39.584
What about Joe?

48:39.684 --> 48:42.920
I don't think we'll be seeing him again.

48:43.021 --> 48:46.491
Joe!

48:46.591 --> 48:49.760
It was you.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.830
I was wondering when you
would show up again, officer.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.766
Everything that has happened,
all because of you.

48:55.866 --> 48:56.634
Because of us.

48:56.734 --> 48:58.603
That is not true.

48:58.703 --> 48:59.971
What's going on, Joe?

49:00.071 --> 49:04.442
It was never the CDC and
the CDC was trying to control it.

49:04.542 --> 49:05.443
It was him.

49:06.444 --> 49:08.479
It was done for the empire,
for our people,

49:08.579 --> 49:11.782
for you, you ungrateful little shit.

49:11.882 --> 49:13.451
So, you're one of them?

49:13.551 --> 49:16.121
Sadly, yes, he claims that our people

49:16.221 --> 49:18.456
want this planet's resources.

49:18.556 --> 49:21.292
And it's time for the arrival
of the armada.

49:21.392 --> 49:24.295
They wait word from me that
the planet is prepared,

49:24.395 --> 49:25.796
my ship was damaged when I landed

49:25.896 --> 49:31.469
and I've been stuck here
ever since until now.

49:31.569 --> 49:34.039
You have given me a way
to complete my mission.

49:34.139 --> 49:35.840
So, you weren't here to save us?

49:35.940 --> 49:37.675
I'm trying to save you.

49:37.775 --> 49:38.643
You've failed.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.478
You're wrong.

49:40.578 --> 49:42.713
It's time for me to return.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.149
Take solace in the knowledge

49:44.249 --> 49:47.985
that your planet will
extend the life of ours.

49:48.086 --> 49:50.821
But why'd you tell us to pack?

49:50.921 --> 49:54.492
You will be studied and examined.

49:54.592 --> 49:56.994
Experimented on.

49:57.095 --> 50:00.331
That's the only reason I kept you alive.

50:00.431 --> 50:06.037
We're not going anywhere with you.

50:06.137 --> 50:07.838
She's a feisty one.

50:07.938 --> 50:11.676
You can learn a thing Ijo Sudin.

50:11.776 --> 50:14.179
That's not gonna do much.

50:19.917 --> 50:22.019
Tickled.

50:22.120 --> 50:25.856
I guess we're done here.

50:25.956 --> 50:27.858
Come on, Joe.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.867
I'm going to find a way.

50:36.967 --> 50:39.404
Stop lying to the girl,

50:39.504 --> 50:43.408
now let's go before I have
to kill one of your girlfriends.

50:46.377 --> 50:50.448
I'm sorry.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.949
I tried.

51:03.060 --> 51:06.431
Oh, stop pouting.

51:06.531 --> 51:08.566
I can't believe such an immature Sednian

51:08.666 --> 51:11.569
could learn time travel.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.738
It's time to go home.

51:13.838 --> 51:15.906
My mission is complete.

51:16.006 --> 51:19.744
All you did was create
a society of the dead.

51:19.844 --> 51:23.748
These earthlings are
persistent even in death.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.085
Not that it matters,

51:28.186 --> 51:31.656
but I was ordered to exterminate them.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.124
What if we get infected?

51:33.224 --> 51:35.160
You have no idea what
this virus could do.

51:35.260 --> 51:38.429
We both know there is only one
weapon hat can destroy us.

51:38.529 --> 51:39.664
That might not be true.

51:39.764 --> 51:42.433
When I used the dead as
a time travel device,

51:42.533 --> 51:44.435
it almost killed me.

51:44.535 --> 51:48.139
This is like nothing our planet
has ever seen.

51:48.239 --> 51:51.609
What if our people get
infected, then what?

51:51.709 --> 51:55.613
We are Sednian, our people
have mastered time and space.

51:58.849 --> 52:01.519
We will find a way.

52:05.956 --> 52:09.794
Open it.

52:09.894 --> 52:12.797
Open it.

52:12.897 --> 52:14.299
I'm not leaving.

52:20.205 --> 52:21.472
Open it.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.474
I can't let you harm these earthlings.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.825
It's the way of our people.

52:40.925 --> 52:44.695
The resources of this planet
are necessary for the empire.

52:44.795 --> 52:48.699
You can't stop the empire,
change is coming.

52:56.541 --> 52:58.509
The bum.

52:58.609 --> 53:00.010
The library.

53:05.516 --> 53:06.417
What are you doing?

53:06.517 --> 53:07.252
I gotta help him.

53:07.352 --> 53:08.753
No, Parker.

53:36.714 --> 53:37.715
No!

54:05.310 --> 54:06.744
Parker!

54:06.844 --> 54:07.745
Fire a shot.

54:07.845 --> 54:09.580
- She's gonna die, Joe.
- I need a zombie.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.582
No, Parker.

54:11.682 --> 54:12.583
Joe, use me.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.952
I can't, you know I can't do that.

54:15.052 --> 54:17.755
It's the only way.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.925
It's the only way.

54:21.025 --> 54:22.760
Parker.

54:22.860 --> 54:25.830
You're the strongest person
I know, okay?

54:25.930 --> 54:27.632
You find somewhere to
hide and you stay there,

54:27.732 --> 54:30.501
you stay there until Joe gets back.

54:30.601 --> 54:31.336
I love you.

54:31.436 --> 54:35.172
I love you, too.

54:35.272 --> 54:38.175
It's time.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.811
It's time.

54:40.911 --> 54:43.481
You know what to do
if you get in trouble.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.125
I'll be fine.

55:16.647 --> 55:22.152
Save our species.

55:22.252 --> 55:23.654
She's gonna die, Joe.

55:23.754 --> 55:25.656
She's gonna die, Joe.

55:34.365 --> 55:38.168
Nothing like a mid-afternoon
nap, huh, babe?

55:38.268 --> 55:40.170
I can think of something better.

55:40.270 --> 55:42.507
Oh, yeah.

55:50.180 --> 55:55.720
Holy cow!

55:55.820 --> 55:58.523
Oh, boy.

55:59.524 --> 56:04.695
Yeah, honeycakes.

56:04.795 --> 56:07.398
Where are we?

56:07.498 --> 56:09.900
You're in my apartment,
you sure you're okay?

56:10.000 --> 56:13.404
Yeah, good, love bug.

56:13.504 --> 56:16.373
Where is your apartment?

56:16.474 --> 56:17.875
In Hoboken.

56:21.646 --> 56:25.049
And today is December 9th?

56:25.149 --> 56:27.051
Yeah.

56:27.151 --> 56:28.218
Perfect.

56:28.318 --> 56:32.389
Sure you're okay?

56:32.490 --> 56:34.892
With an hour to save the world.

56:34.992 --> 56:39.063
Now, I wish I was the Flash.

56:39.163 --> 56:43.734
The Flash, what the hell
are you talking about?

56:43.834 --> 56:45.235
What's going on with you?

56:45.335 --> 56:46.771
Those are my...

56:46.871 --> 56:48.072
See you later, love bug.

56:48.172 --> 56:52.810
Hey, come back to bed.

56:52.910 --> 56:57.582
Parker, Parker, are you there?

56:57.682 --> 56:59.584
I'm here, something's
happening, I'm scared.

56:59.684 --> 57:02.319
I know, Parker, I'm sorry.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.589
I need you to do something
for me, though.

57:04.689 --> 57:07.424
I need you to be strong and
remember, can you do that?

57:07.525 --> 57:09.259
Yeah.

57:09.359 --> 57:10.260
Good.

57:11.261 --> 57:12.930
Now, do you remember
how to get to the library?

57:13.030 --> 57:17.301
I'm on...

57:17.401 --> 57:19.303
105th and 5th Avenue.

57:19.403 --> 57:20.938
I'm not much of a library girl,

57:21.038 --> 57:23.273
Sammy was always
the one who liked to read.

57:23.373 --> 57:25.776
Did you ever go to the library with her?

57:25.876 --> 57:28.813
Once.

57:28.913 --> 57:30.347
Do you remember the cross street?

57:30.447 --> 57:32.449
Think really hard.

57:32.550 --> 57:38.455
I can't remember.

57:38.556 --> 57:39.690
Do you know where the library is?

57:39.790 --> 57:40.525
Come on.

57:40.625 --> 57:43.293
Get your hands off me.

57:43.393 --> 57:45.996
Does anyone know where the library is?

57:46.096 --> 57:48.633
It's okay, we're gonna do this.

57:48.733 --> 57:49.967
Tell me what you do remember.

57:50.067 --> 57:51.301
Tell me about that day.

57:51.401 --> 57:53.470
Do you remember anything
special about the day?

57:53.571 --> 57:56.473
It was Sammy birthday.

57:56.574 --> 57:57.842
That's a great start,

57:57.942 --> 58:00.477
keep talking, anything you remember.

58:00.578 --> 58:02.479
And we had pancakes for breakfast.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.515
We made whipped cream faces on them

58:04.615 --> 58:06.851
and then we got dressed and walked.

58:06.951 --> 58:08.553
We walked past the big park

58:08.653 --> 58:11.321
with the statue of an old dead guy

58:11.421 --> 58:13.824
and there was a green building

58:13.924 --> 58:15.660
and there was a yellow bakery.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.027
We had already had breakfast,

58:17.127 --> 58:19.730
but we got hot chocolate
and muffins anyway.

58:19.830 --> 58:23.734
And there was a woman dog walker
with two Great Danes.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.172
And then I can't remember.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.841
Just keep remembering, Parker.

58:30.941 --> 58:32.577
What was the weather like?

58:32.677 --> 58:34.545
So cold you could see your breath.

58:34.645 --> 58:36.513
Cloudy, but the sun was coming out.

58:36.614 --> 58:38.015
I remember looking down the street

58:38.115 --> 58:39.850
with a firehouse down the corner

58:39.950 --> 58:42.352
and almost being blinded
by a silver building.

58:42.452 --> 58:44.354
It was so bright you
could barely look at it.

58:44.454 --> 58:45.522
I see it.

58:45.623 --> 58:48.192
I see the red building
and the tall building,

58:48.292 --> 58:51.028
where did you go next?

58:51.128 --> 58:53.030
We kept going straight for a little bit

58:53.130 --> 58:56.200
and we walked along 5th Avenue
along the wall,

58:56.300 --> 58:58.402
then Sammy knew
a shortcut and we turned.

58:58.502 --> 59:01.071
We turned at the blue mailbox.

59:04.541 --> 59:07.878
Which way did you turn?

59:07.978 --> 59:09.213
Right, no left.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.615
Which way?

59:10.715 --> 59:12.216
I can't remember.

59:12.316 --> 59:14.051
I need you to stop crying,

59:14.151 --> 59:16.553

59:16.654 --> 59:18.623
I remember walking up to the counter

59:18.723 --> 59:23.393
and there was this cooky
librarian with brown hair.

59:23.493 --> 59:24.962
Do you know stupid Nicki Minaj
was calling me,

59:25.062 --> 59:27.064
I said, "Stop calling me,
you know I like Beyonce."
