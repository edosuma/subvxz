00:00.219 --> 00:04.080
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:04.220 --> 00:06.380
Let's find it should be this area recording

00:06.380 --> 00:07.790
recording that thing might be man-made

00:07.880 --> 00:09.900
almost looks like gonna anchor we're

00:10.190 --> 00:12.540
gonna find out scientifically how all

00:12.600 --> 00:14.200
these bits of paper are red diamond

00:14.240 --> 00:15.809
doesn't seem to have something on this

00:15.900 --> 00:20.949
is from maybe even pop the grounds gone

00:21.009 --> 00:23.379
its Kevin this is a very dangerous place

00:23.449 --> 00:25.049
the whole money pit could collapse

00:25.079 --> 00:27.849
Oh baby be careful Oh

00:31.210 --> 00:34.010
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.200 --> 00:36.880
where people have been looking for an

00:36.910 --> 00:39.280
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.280 --> 00:43.740
years so far they have found a stone

00:43.780 --> 00:47.090
slab with strange symbols carved into it

00:47.140 --> 00:50.890
mysterious fragments of human bone and a

00:50.890 --> 00:54.110
LED cross whose origin may stretch back

00:54.190 --> 00:56.540
to the days of the Knights Templar

00:56.710 --> 00:59.980
to date six men have died trying to

01:00.040 --> 01:02.430
solve the mystery

01:02.480 --> 01:05.530
and according to legend one more will

01:05.630 --> 01:09.520
have to die before the treasure can be

01:09.530 --> 01:10.770
found

01:11.120 --> 01:12.120
[Music]

01:20.470 --> 01:26.400
as a new day begins on Oak Island and as

01:26.450 --> 01:29.545
the excavation of borehole h8 continues

01:29.600 --> 01:31.473
at the money pit site

01:32.702 --> 01:36.502
Brothers Marty and Rick lagina check in on their extensive

01:36.530 --> 01:38.807
search operations at Smith's Cove have

01:40.790 --> 01:42.630
you figured this out yet

01:42.730 --> 01:45.040
it's a lot to figure we're closing in on

01:45.230 --> 01:46.620
a few points Warren and Laird

01:46.640 --> 01:47.970
how are you buddy good Barney how are

01:48.020 --> 01:50.300
you good Jerry

01:50.670 --> 01:53.210
well you guys have made a hell of a mess

01:53.300 --> 01:56.100
here oh yeah you just got down to where

01:56.210 --> 01:58.380
you can see things that's all a lot of

01:58.400 --> 02:00.019
people thought that this was a very

02:00.080 --> 02:02.100
significant place to do something put a

02:02.119 --> 02:06.000
lot of effort in to put a lot of effort

02:06.130 --> 02:08.229
it's very strange

02:08.289 --> 02:10.949
shortly after the excavation of Smith's

02:11.030 --> 02:13.210
Cove began six weeks ago

02:13.250 --> 02:15.650
the Oak Island team quickly made a

02:15.710 --> 02:18.290
series of incredible and often baffling

02:18.350 --> 02:22.140
discoveries among them a number of

02:22.190 --> 02:24.950
massive wooden structures one featuring

02:25.040 --> 02:27.470
large notched beams marked with Roman

02:27.650 --> 02:30.440
numerals and another in the shape of an

02:30.470 --> 02:33.900
L the team also uncovered the remains of

02:34.040 --> 02:36.510
what appears to be an ancient slipway

02:36.600 --> 02:39.410
used for hauling ships into and out of

02:39.510 --> 02:44.280
the water and a mysterious concrete wall

02:44.310 --> 02:46.070
we don't understand some of these

02:46.080 --> 02:47.880
structures we've found all kinds of

02:47.970 --> 02:51.040
crazy things walls and slipways and

02:51.180 --> 02:53.560
concrete walls that we didn't even know

02:53.640 --> 02:57.050
existed and all of it massive and all of

02:57.060 --> 02:58.580
it looking like it took an enormous

02:58.650 --> 03:01.350
effort to do all of it underwater very

03:01.380 --> 03:03.980
very puzzling right there see the

03:04.050 --> 03:07.130
opening yeah two flat rocks laid

03:07.380 --> 03:09.620
together like a triangle but perhaps the

03:09.630 --> 03:12.380
most significant discovery so far is

03:12.420 --> 03:14.840
what Rick and Marty believe could be the

03:14.880 --> 03:17.270
remains of one of what were reported to

03:17.340 --> 03:20.400
be five stone box drains designed as a

03:20.670 --> 03:22.439
means of booby trapping the money pit

03:22.500 --> 03:25.710
with seawater the odd thing from the

03:25.739 --> 03:27.690
spillway we found really nice ceramics

03:27.810 --> 03:30.600
from down at the East End it slaughter

03:30.690 --> 03:34.420
or searcher yeah searcher early searcher

03:34.500 --> 03:38.210
so could they possibly have done all

03:38.220 --> 03:40.969
this without really concrete proof of

03:41.010 --> 03:42.590
the box drains it seems hard to believe

03:42.669 --> 03:45.070
doesn't I mean yeah could they have done

03:45.090 --> 03:48.400
this on conjecture where's the so-called

03:48.570 --> 03:51.740
convergence point we don't know where it

03:51.900 --> 03:53.629
comes in I thought we would find

03:53.640 --> 03:56.240
something here was some sort of

03:56.329 --> 03:59.530
alignment coming in although Rick and

03:59.640 --> 04:01.490
Marty are excited by all their other

04:01.530 --> 04:04.060
discoveries at Smith's Cove unearthing

04:04.290 --> 04:06.570
one of the stone box drains has given

04:06.660 --> 04:08.630
them hope of finding what they refer to

04:08.670 --> 04:11.950
as the convergence point the place where

04:12.030 --> 04:14.230
each of the five box drains joined

04:14.250 --> 04:15.459
together

04:15.530 --> 04:17.820
if it is located it could lead the team

04:17.959 --> 04:19.750
directly to the original money pit

04:19.820 --> 04:22.550
treasure vault if it were the Box trains

04:22.550 --> 04:24.760
if we can actually prove that it was a

04:24.950 --> 04:27.790
way to get water from Smith's Cove to

04:27.860 --> 04:30.250
the money pit since it's a huge

04:30.290 --> 04:33.570
discovery well one thing is extremely

04:33.650 --> 04:39.910
consistent nothing makes sense as the

04:40.070 --> 04:42.030
excavation continues at Smith's Cove

04:42.110 --> 04:46.430
just across the bay from Oak Island in

04:46.430 --> 04:48.520
the town of western shore Nova Scotia

04:48.530 --> 04:50.630
good morning morning how are you today

04:50.720 --> 04:54.190
Craig tester and Jack Begley arrived at

04:54.230 --> 04:56.990
the Oak Island marina they have arranged

04:56.990 --> 04:59.500
to meet with an oceanic survey team from

04:59.690 --> 05:02.240
the center of Geographic Sciences also

05:02.300 --> 05:05.220
known as cogs I'm looking forward to

05:05.240 --> 05:08.040
being able to scan from the south end of

05:08.120 --> 05:09.450
the island if some of the theories are

05:09.540 --> 05:11.400
that that that was kind of an old flood

05:11.450 --> 05:13.950
system that went out there although it

05:14.000 --> 05:16.160
has long been believed that the origin

05:16.250 --> 05:17.360
of the booby-trapped flood tunnels

05:17.360 --> 05:21.260
system could be found at Smith's Cove

05:21.760 --> 05:24.840
Craig tester is equally intrigued by a

05:24.860 --> 05:26.720
theory held by journalist and author

05:26.840 --> 05:29.950
Randall Sullivan which suggests that a

05:30.020 --> 05:32.070
second set of flood tunnels might be

05:32.150 --> 05:35.080
found on the islands southern shore just

05:35.270 --> 05:38.140
east of the triangle-shaped swamp I'm

05:38.180 --> 05:40.340
certain that the real core stones in the

05:40.340 --> 05:43.500
flood tunnel is you knowing way offshore

05:43.640 --> 05:47.200
you know on the south side

05:48.280 --> 05:51.250
so what are we running today well so

05:51.400 --> 05:53.030
what we have up here is a lidar scanner

05:53.050 --> 05:53.830
okay

05:53.830 --> 05:56.190
so that is going to actually take a scan

05:56.230 --> 05:59.220
of the shoreline of Oak Island okay and

05:59.290 --> 06:01.640
then we'll be running a side-scan fish

06:01.720 --> 06:05.100
right from the court here on the stern

06:05.140 --> 06:06.970
so anything that looks man-made it'll

06:07.000 --> 06:10.770
pick it up okay sounds great

06:11.730 --> 06:14.110
using state-of-the-art marine imaging

06:14.280 --> 06:17.270
equipment the team from cogs will employ

06:17.310 --> 06:19.690
both sound and laser based technologies

06:19.770 --> 06:22.210
to scan the waters surrounding Oak

06:22.290 --> 06:25.670
Island if successful they might be able

06:25.710 --> 06:27.490
to find evidence of manmade formations

06:27.570 --> 06:32.690
up to 30 feet beneath the seabed

06:33.610 --> 06:36.300
turning turning are we getting ready to

06:36.370 --> 06:38.380
do some lines yeah

06:38.400 --> 06:43.130
we're lining up okay are you going

06:43.180 --> 06:45.950
east-west lines or north-south right now

06:46.030 --> 06:47.350
we're doing north-south lines but we

06:47.350 --> 06:48.820
actually have east-west in there as well

06:48.850 --> 06:50.910
plus you're gonna do both yeah great

06:50.920 --> 06:54.220
start reporting start reporting we're

06:54.310 --> 06:58.380
recording the team will scan along a

06:58.420 --> 07:01.610
total of some 30 lines arranged five

07:01.780 --> 07:04.480
meters apart in a systematic grid

07:04.510 --> 07:06.790
pattern which will allow them to totally

07:06.880 --> 07:10.890
encompass the islands coastal area

07:13.070 --> 07:17.510
and ER what deaf do you have 7.8 you

07:17.510 --> 07:19.620
guys getting rocks

07:19.710 --> 07:27.030
I can't see anything what's your depth

07:27.120 --> 07:30.239
right now two and a half got some rocks

07:30.330 --> 07:33.139
quite a bit of raw

07:33.150 --> 07:35.370
there's like a line of rocks but that's

07:35.460 --> 07:38.270
not necessarily

07:39.169 --> 07:41.440
that's interesting yeah I'm finally

07:41.449 --> 07:43.280
seeing something yeah cuz almost looks

07:43.340 --> 07:45.619
like there's a hole down through stuff

07:45.680 --> 07:47.400
will come up there's definitely a

07:47.419 --> 07:49.749
distinctive line there

07:49.800 --> 07:54.349
yeah okay turn it

07:56.700 --> 07:59.300
I almost look big it could be a caved-in

07:59.310 --> 08:03.240
area or something that's still there now

08:03.300 --> 08:05.820
that right there looks like some sort of

08:05.940 --> 08:07.950
shaped like it could be van me

08:08.020 --> 08:10.150
okay

08:11.010 --> 08:13.480
while scanning the waters off the south

08:13.560 --> 08:16.290
shore of Oak Island Craig tester and

08:16.380 --> 08:19.250
Jack Begley along with the team from the

08:19.290 --> 08:22.280
center of geographic Sciences have just

08:22.350 --> 08:24.770
made what could be an exciting discovery

08:24.780 --> 08:28.410
an offshore hole located in the same

08:28.470 --> 08:31.090
area where author and researcher Randall

08:31.110 --> 08:33.309
Sullivan believes there could be a

08:33.390 --> 08:34.970
second booby-trapped flood tunnels

08:35.010 --> 08:37.698
system that feeds ocean water to the

08:37.770 --> 08:39.509
money pit

08:39.599 --> 08:43.320
now that right there looks like some

08:43.409 --> 08:45.380
very light material and the depression

08:45.420 --> 08:49.680
love that very anything oh yeah so you

08:49.680 --> 08:51.120
don't know of anything that's in here do

08:51.180 --> 08:52.850
you some of the ice holes could be here

08:52.920 --> 08:56.800
in this area okay during the winter of

08:56.850 --> 08:59.930
1980 veteran treasure hunter dan

09:00.000 --> 09:02.029
Blankenship was conducting an operation

09:02.130 --> 09:04.570
in the money pit area which involved

09:04.829 --> 09:06.700
pumping water out of recently drilled

09:06.870 --> 09:09.600
bore holes into the ocean just off the

09:09.600 --> 09:12.599
islands southern shore but shortly after

09:12.600 --> 09:15.809
the operation began dan was astonished

09:15.899 --> 09:18.140
to notice four of what he described as

09:18.209 --> 09:20.940
ice holes circular depressions in the

09:20.940 --> 09:22.700
ice that he thought might have been

09:22.740 --> 09:25.450
caused by underground caves or man-made

09:25.500 --> 09:29.369
tunnels could the anomaly Craig and Jack

09:29.550 --> 09:32.059
are seen on the ocean floor be further

09:32.069 --> 09:34.160
evidence that his second flood tunnel

09:34.259 --> 09:37.329
system really exists

09:37.360 --> 09:40.239
on one line we saw what I could have

09:40.329 --> 09:42.779
been like an edge of an ice hole really

09:42.939 --> 09:44.610
but that's what I mean there was suppose

09:44.679 --> 09:47.090
a for isil's yeah they should be right

09:47.110 --> 09:49.239
here right should be in this area yeah

09:49.290 --> 09:51.190
you have to look at that after

09:51.239 --> 09:53.210
processing to see if it jumps out

09:53.290 --> 09:56.039
morning we're getting real-time images

09:56.110 --> 09:58.189
coming back but there's a lot of noise

09:58.239 --> 10:01.069
associated with it it's just like you're

10:01.089 --> 10:03.230
turned into a radio station and he kind

10:03.369 --> 10:05.209
of can hear the music but there's a lot

10:05.230 --> 10:07.789
of noise well she can take it back and

10:07.809 --> 10:10.369
process it and get rid of that noise you

10:10.389 --> 10:14.719
get a nice clear image what's the next

10:14.769 --> 10:21.119
line NS + c5 recording recording

10:21.570 --> 10:23.809
and see anything what's out on the

10:24.120 --> 10:25.620
right-hand side there well right there

10:25.709 --> 10:28.290
you can see there's clearly something

10:28.320 --> 10:31.239
there that doesn't look like it could be

10:31.290 --> 10:34.089
natural it's very angular almost like an

10:34.139 --> 10:39.000
anchor an anchor from a ship although

10:39.089 --> 10:41.040
finding an anchor in the waters of

10:41.100 --> 10:43.920
Mahone Bay is not a surprising discovery

10:43.940 --> 10:47.209
if it can be successfully identified and

10:47.220 --> 10:49.619
proves to be from an era prior to the

10:49.709 --> 10:53.769
discovery of the money pit in 1795 it

10:53.819 --> 10:55.970
could offer important clues that might

10:56.069 --> 10:57.819
help the team solve the Oak Island

10:57.870 --> 10:59.740
mystery so we're thinking that that

10:59.819 --> 11:01.960
thing was probably wada it's about yay

11:02.040 --> 11:03.590
long or something I think that's the

11:03.660 --> 11:05.120
approximate size of one that's supposed

11:05.190 --> 11:08.170
to be yeah and then once you guys go

11:08.220 --> 11:09.779
through the post-processing you should

11:09.870 --> 11:11.530
have the exact location of that object

11:11.579 --> 11:14.060
good you know on the scans today we

11:14.130 --> 11:16.730
definitely saw some anomalies out there

11:16.860 --> 11:19.140
so I'm eager to see what they come up

11:19.230 --> 11:20.680
with once they start processing this

11:20.940 --> 11:22.489
data I mean if we come up with a

11:22.680 --> 11:24.350
shipwreck or we come up with one of

11:24.389 --> 11:26.710
these ice holes the next step is to get

11:26.850 --> 11:28.969
a diver out there and keep on searching

11:29.010 --> 11:32.029
this keep on tying the ocean to the

11:32.069 --> 11:34.510
island itself post-processing

11:34.529 --> 11:37.310
bring something out

11:43.209 --> 11:46.270
at the start of another day on Oak

11:46.339 --> 11:49.829
Island good morning Rick lagina has

11:49.970 --> 11:51.829
invited other members of the Oak Island

11:51.829 --> 11:55.089
team to join him in the war room so

11:55.129 --> 11:56.609
gentlemen as you see before you we have

11:56.689 --> 11:59.179
a you know a number of items here and

11:59.209 --> 12:02.660
they're all from age 8 th8 certainly has

12:02.779 --> 12:05.240
rendered the most significant objects

12:05.360 --> 12:08.159
and in the entire money pit exploration

12:08.240 --> 12:09.299
[Music]

12:09.459 --> 12:12.389
of all the exploratory bore holes

12:12.499 --> 12:15.589
drilled at the money pit site the one

12:15.589 --> 12:17.620
that is the most intriguing is the one

12:17.689 --> 12:20.820
simply known as a chain

12:20.820 --> 12:23.800
last year while drilling at this site

12:23.920 --> 12:26.680
Rick and his brother Marty along with

12:26.800 --> 12:28.460
other members of the Oak Island team

12:28.480 --> 12:31.900
found evidence of parchment leather

12:31.960 --> 12:35.400
bookbinding and two fragments of 17th

12:35.500 --> 12:38.790
century human bone one which was

12:38.800 --> 12:41.290
determined to be of European origin and

12:41.290 --> 12:44.270
another whose DNA could be traced to the

12:44.290 --> 12:47.980
Middle East Paul if you want to see if

12:48.070 --> 12:56.040
dr. Russo hello dr. Bruce all dr. Bruce

12:56.080 --> 12:59.670
oh we're back dr. Krista Bruce oh he's

12:59.740 --> 13:01.850
an analytical chemist in residence at

13:01.870 --> 13:05.580
st. Mary's University in Halifax she has

13:05.650 --> 13:07.460
been invited by Rick and the team to

13:07.480 --> 13:09.730
evaluate several of the recent finds

13:09.760 --> 13:12.110
made in h8 to see if any of them

13:12.130 --> 13:14.320
contained precious metal human remains

13:14.410 --> 13:16.980
or other materials that can be proven to

13:17.020 --> 13:19.100
be older than the discovery of the money

13:19.180 --> 13:22.280
pit you know we're all very excited for

13:22.300 --> 13:23.670
you to render an opinion about these

13:23.680 --> 13:25.820
objects so if you'd be kind enough to

13:25.870 --> 13:28.120
let us know what you found out

13:28.120 --> 13:30.150
sure I can walk you through these

13:30.220 --> 13:32.620
objects so when you send me these

13:32.650 --> 13:35.140
objects they came with a number and also

13:35.320 --> 13:37.090
what you thought they might be question

13:37.240 --> 13:40.080
mark mm-hmm so I guess we'll start with

13:40.090 --> 13:41.830
sample 15

13:41.880 --> 13:43.679
that was a sample that you were

13:44.130 --> 13:46.069
wondering if it was a bone and then had

13:46.079 --> 13:48.189
some fibers on it mm-hmm so that came

13:48.269 --> 13:52.520
back as iron rich in sulfur it has about

13:52.589 --> 13:56.200
seven percent sulfur and so I would

13:56.220 --> 14:00.249
think of that as being a slag sort of

14:00.300 --> 14:03.360
cast off from a poor refining process so

14:03.449 --> 14:07.900
it's sort of metal slag metal slag

14:08.060 --> 14:10.769
created when metal is extracted from raw

14:10.800 --> 14:13.719
or slag is most often found near

14:13.769 --> 14:16.210
foundries or other places where smelting

14:16.319 --> 14:19.350
is conducted because it is made part

14:19.410 --> 14:22.049
officially it is rarely as in the case

14:22.050 --> 14:26.149
of Oak Island found deep underground

14:31.399 --> 14:34.750
yeah I mean a slag is not that strange

14:34.769 --> 14:37.250
but I guess being founded depth might be

14:37.250 --> 14:41.840
so the next sample sample 13 you

14:41.850 --> 14:43.700
indicated that you thought it might be

14:43.740 --> 14:45.580
leather mm-hmm

14:45.600 --> 14:50.609
that is definitely plant material I can

14:50.880 --> 14:54.120
clearly see the plant vasculature in the

14:54.209 --> 14:57.710
electron micrograph so that could be

14:57.720 --> 15:02.310
just tree bark okay okay

15:02.310 --> 15:05.610
sample 19 you had indicated you thought

15:05.610 --> 15:08.279
it might be leather it's not leather

15:08.310 --> 15:11.560
it's again a plant based material this

15:11.579 --> 15:16.150
is likely to be a piece of tree per

15:16.160 --> 15:19.170
I expected a whole lot more leather this

15:19.250 --> 15:21.120
year and these were the best pieces that

15:21.170 --> 15:25.200
we were able to find okay moving on

15:25.220 --> 15:28.690
sample 17 so I did infrared spectroscopy

15:28.700 --> 15:33.880
on it and it is cellulose based it came

15:33.890 --> 15:35.630
back as all organic

15:35.680 --> 15:38.470
it is very fibrous so under the

15:38.630 --> 15:41.790
microscope looks like paper and so our

15:41.870 --> 15:43.390
indication at that point was that it

15:43.490 --> 15:45.240
that wasn't parchment but a cotton right

15:45.290 --> 15:48.080
beaker which would be an older form of

15:48.140 --> 15:54.380
paper rag paper as early as the 12th

15:54.380 --> 15:57.310
century AD the first paper produced

15:57.380 --> 15:59.510
throughout medieval Europe was made

15:59.510 --> 16:01.550
entirely from linen and cotton scraps

16:01.610 --> 16:05.990
known more commonly as rags by the mid

16:06.050 --> 16:09.190
15th century rag paper was much more

16:09.290 --> 16:11.340
commonly used in the production of books

16:11.390 --> 16:13.890
and manuscripts often bound together

16:13.940 --> 16:16.630
with more durable parchment

16:16.690 --> 16:18.690
when treasure hunters William Chappell

16:18.730 --> 16:21.190
and Frederick Blair drilled into what

16:21.190 --> 16:23.229
they believed to be a wooden vault in

16:23.290 --> 16:26.779
1897 they discovered a tiny piece of

16:26.829 --> 16:29.010
parchment that had the letters V I

16:29.079 --> 16:33.229
written on it could this piece of rag

16:33.310 --> 16:37.250
paper found more than 170 feet deep be

16:37.329 --> 16:39.850
evidence that books or even original

16:39.850 --> 16:42.160
manuscripts might have been buried in

16:42.250 --> 16:45.970
the money pit centuries ago

16:46.060 --> 16:51.580
okay sample 18 this is also paper it's

16:51.670 --> 16:54.830
more contaminated this particular sample

16:54.880 --> 17:00.380
is certainly three 1890 Wow

17:00.430 --> 17:02.950
what would we do what further testing

17:02.980 --> 17:05.910
methodologies would we apply to to date

17:05.950 --> 17:08.099
it well probably what I would do is have

17:08.109 --> 17:10.230
I looked at by someone who works with

17:10.300 --> 17:15.109
papers historical papers well dr. BIR so

17:15.130 --> 17:16.450
thank you for your time we really

17:16.510 --> 17:17.869
appreciate it

17:17.950 --> 17:20.410
we hope to send you some gold soon for

17:20.470 --> 17:27.609
testing already speaking of that let's

17:27.609 --> 17:30.210
get back to you

17:35.580 --> 17:37.560
following their informative meeting in

17:37.650 --> 17:43.240
the oak island war room jack begley and

17:43.260 --> 17:46.380
gary drayton joined Marty lagina Craig

17:46.440 --> 17:49.860
tester and dan henskee at the h8 drill

17:49.980 --> 17:53.420
site they are eager to examine the

17:53.760 --> 17:56.170
spoils recently excavated from the shaft

17:56.220 --> 17:59.060
in search of any additional artifacts

17:59.070 --> 18:03.260
and hopefully pieces of treasure

18:05.919 --> 18:09.140
plastic plastic maybe

18:09.270 --> 18:12.740
Oh what thick that is that's a pottery

18:12.840 --> 18:17.540
big chunk of pottery it's a blue yeah

18:20.390 --> 18:23.040
damn sure is

18:23.120 --> 18:26.300
Wow that's interesting yeah

18:26.440 --> 18:29.440
it's game time because every bucket that

18:29.500 --> 18:31.220
comes up might lead us to some

18:31.240 --> 18:33.400
conclusions and help us with the hunt it

18:33.520 --> 18:35.130
might lead us to where we want to go and

18:35.200 --> 18:36.650
where we want to go is to find the

18:36.730 --> 18:45.750
original money limestone lots of it yeah

18:47.000 --> 18:53.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

18:55.080 --> 18:57.230
this looks like pretty recent lumber

18:57.300 --> 18:59.360
like within the last hundred years or so

18:59.430 --> 19:02.100
it's all cleaned and cut perfectly

19:02.160 --> 19:05.010
square that tends to be searchers

19:05.100 --> 19:09.730
proving or something mm-hmm I'm not

19:09.810 --> 19:15.930
seeing anything Jackie there we go

19:17.240 --> 19:19.960
this looks like organic material and it

19:20.030 --> 19:22.110
doesn't look like bark I think this is

19:22.160 --> 19:28.220
leather that's a really good piece of it

19:28.510 --> 19:30.440
because you can see all the fibrous

19:30.520 --> 19:34.880
material definitely bag that one okay I

19:35.040 --> 19:39.500
will beg it anyway I have to look at

19:39.580 --> 19:42.900
everything yep

19:49.560 --> 19:52.560
what is it boy yes Wow

19:52.800 --> 19:56.350
that is an old beautiful square man yeah

19:56.460 --> 19:59.700
that's nice good fun how does this

19:59.850 --> 20:02.080
compare to the other spikes we found in

20:02.100 --> 20:04.850
the money a different usage these were

20:04.980 --> 20:07.870
mainly used for planking if I was a

20:07.950 --> 20:10.130
maritime nail that would be a deck in

20:10.170 --> 20:15.890
nail a decking nail from a ship but how

20:15.930 --> 20:18.090
would a deck email come to be found at a

20:18.090 --> 20:22.300
depth of some 170 feet

20:22.490 --> 20:25.020
in the years after Daniel McGinnis and

20:25.100 --> 20:27.000
two friends discovered the original

20:27.020 --> 20:31.070
money pit in 1795 many began to

20:31.100 --> 20:33.150
speculate that the wood used to

20:33.170 --> 20:35.150
construct the treasure shaft may have

20:35.150 --> 20:38.380
come from a large ship possibly a pirate

20:38.450 --> 20:42.330
ship or Spanish galleon according to

20:42.380 --> 20:44.490
this theory it was done both to build

20:44.930 --> 20:47.390
the ship and to hide all evidence of the

20:47.390 --> 20:49.680
craft that transported the treasure to

20:49.790 --> 20:51.150
the island

20:51.280 --> 20:53.280
could the discovery of a ship's nail

20:53.350 --> 20:56.650
found in the h8 spoils beat evidence

20:56.680 --> 21:00.640
that this incredible theory is true we

21:00.850 --> 21:02.700
haven't actually found this tide before

21:02.740 --> 21:06.380
this is the first one it is we could be

21:06.400 --> 21:08.350
in the original money pit that yep

21:08.380 --> 21:10.350
that might be a really good sign yeah

21:10.350 --> 21:13.870
I'm gonna tag him back this squid now

21:13.950 --> 21:20.440
really good fine as the operation at age

21:20.470 --> 21:23.950
8 continues we're here Alex lagina and

21:24.040 --> 21:27.380
historian Doug crawl travel some 50

21:27.550 --> 21:29.500
miles to the nearby city of Halifax

21:29.580 --> 21:32.130
where they have arranged a meeting at

21:32.200 --> 21:34.820
the Nova Scotia School of Art and Design

21:34.830 --> 21:38.900
Hey Joe Joe Joe Landry is considered an

21:38.920 --> 21:41.430
expert in the study and restoration of

21:41.500 --> 21:44.230
ancient manuscripts he has been invited

21:44.230 --> 21:46.240
to follow up on information recently

21:46.330 --> 21:49.200
received from dr. Christopher O soul at

21:49.240 --> 21:51.940
Saint Mary's University which indicated

21:52.000 --> 21:54.040
that the small fragments of paper

21:54.040 --> 21:57.000
recently found in the h8 spoils had been

21:57.040 --> 22:00.300
made of cotton rags

22:00.920 --> 22:02.830
well thanks for taking the time to sit

22:02.840 --> 22:05.910
down with us again know we have a few

22:05.930 --> 22:08.020
things that we'd love your expertise on

22:08.110 --> 22:11.350
we were a step ahead and we already

22:11.420 --> 22:12.930
checked to see if it was parchment we

22:12.950 --> 22:15.130
got a negative tell me what you think

22:15.230 --> 22:17.230
this is

22:25.990 --> 22:29.429
certainiy feels like paper but we think

22:29.480 --> 22:32.840
this came from 160 feet below or a

22:32.929 --> 22:35.800
little deeper this was underground for

22:35.840 --> 22:37.980
you know maybe a couple hundred years is

22:38.000 --> 22:39.290
it plausible that it would be in that

22:39.380 --> 22:42.590
state if it was deep underground and wet

22:42.590 --> 22:44.000
there's probably very little oxygen

22:44.090 --> 22:47.260
getting getting at it and perhaps lots

22:47.300 --> 22:50.650
of many microbes and insects to eat eat

22:50.960 --> 22:53.710
it away so yeah it could be it could be

22:53.750 --> 22:55.550
very old and could be original is what

22:55.610 --> 22:58.159
that sounds like yes yes that's great

22:58.250 --> 22:58.970
yeah

22:59.059 --> 23:01.030
it's very different from the other piece

23:01.070 --> 23:05.290
so I think to me it seems to be a

23:05.330 --> 23:07.450
different material so I'll just actually

23:07.490 --> 23:10.750
hand it to you because it might fall out

23:16.420 --> 23:19.770
some color here right the interest you

23:19.850 --> 23:21.390
don't see whether it's an ink or a page

23:21.470 --> 23:23.680
or something I'm hoping that there's

23:23.690 --> 23:25.220
maybe some traces of writing on there

23:25.280 --> 23:27.850
yeah it should be impossible to say

23:27.920 --> 23:30.310
unless unless we open it up right

23:30.350 --> 23:32.150
I think that's there's no reason not to

23:32.210 --> 23:34.759
do that in my opinion yeah I would wet

23:34.850 --> 23:38.010
it again in order to unfold it you don't

23:38.059 --> 23:39.400
want to do that dry because you're

23:39.410 --> 23:41.520
damaged the paper right we'd love to

23:41.600 --> 23:43.460
have you taking a closer look

23:43.520 --> 23:46.379
certainly it's difficult to think of a

23:46.460 --> 23:48.610
reason for paper to be 160 feet down in

23:48.679 --> 23:51.100
the money pit area if Joe is able to

23:51.110 --> 23:52.979
unfold this paper and if it's got

23:53.000 --> 23:54.510
writing on it it's gonna be a really

23:54.679 --> 23:57.350
really important clue working with his

23:57.410 --> 24:00.010
apprentice Katherine Taylor Joe Landry

24:00.350 --> 24:02.420
soaks both of the paper fragments in

24:02.510 --> 24:04.709
water we've started the process of

24:04.820 --> 24:07.220
soaking it to make it pliable so we can

24:07.309 --> 24:09.060
open it up right

24:09.120 --> 24:11.710
the sample is then carefully manipulated

24:11.760 --> 24:15.160
using surgical forceps in an effort to

24:15.210 --> 24:17.710
determine if any possible writing or

24:17.760 --> 24:22.310
important clues could still be visible

24:22.370 --> 24:28.290
it looks like this is folded but it's

24:28.320 --> 24:31.120
almost like there's something adhering

24:31.190 --> 24:38.100
inside definitely seems like there's a

24:38.120 --> 24:45.500
crease there and binding it could it be

24:45.600 --> 24:48.250
that this tiny fragment of paper is not

24:48.300 --> 24:51.140
a piece from a single document but part

24:51.150 --> 24:54.460
of a page from an ancient book any

24:54.540 --> 24:56.450
thoughts on the the coloration of that

24:56.460 --> 24:59.190
sometimes they deliberately colored

24:59.250 --> 25:01.810
paper in book bindings or end papers or

25:01.890 --> 25:04.630
something of that nature what can you

25:04.710 --> 25:07.220
infer from what you've seen so far is it

25:07.230 --> 25:11.480
an older type of paper it appears so if

25:11.520 --> 25:14.560
you look through the lens looks very

25:14.580 --> 25:17.440
very even do you mind if I have a look

25:17.460 --> 25:20.220
here what does that even s indicate to

25:20.340 --> 25:22.560
you well could indicate either a wou

25:22.620 --> 25:26.430
paper or a piece of thin cloth if it's a

25:26.460 --> 25:29.610
wolf paper then we know that it's post

25:29.630 --> 25:32.800
1737 or maybe you've been earlier you

25:32.910 --> 25:34.440
can see the fibers but we can't see

25:34.500 --> 25:37.720
anything else all the dates seem to be

25:37.740 --> 25:40.290
centered around the mid to late 1700s

25:40.320 --> 25:42.690
and it fits really nicely with the

25:42.690 --> 25:44.700
origin story of Oak Island really you

25:44.790 --> 25:47.640
know the 1795 discovery of freshmen in

25:47.700 --> 25:50.010
the ground fits really well with a bunch

25:50.040 --> 25:54.110
of activity 20 to 30 years before

25:54.450 --> 25:57.570
we have this other piece as well which

25:57.580 --> 25:59.760
in a way it's even more interesting

25:59.770 --> 26:02.690
because there's color involved and it

26:02.760 --> 26:06.170
does I think there it could be there's

26:06.190 --> 26:08.410
certainly a red spot here we don't know

26:08.470 --> 26:10.160
what that is whether it's a matter that

26:10.210 --> 26:12.710
it picked up in the ground almost looks

26:12.760 --> 26:16.160
like a speck of red ink right let that

26:16.210 --> 26:18.970
line there cuz like a line to me oh yes

26:19.060 --> 26:21.370
right here yes

26:21.370 --> 26:23.449
if you look through the loop here he

26:23.470 --> 26:25.070
definitely looks like a mark online

26:25.149 --> 26:30.299
doesn't it no for sure I'd like to

26:30.370 --> 26:32.630
investigate the ink yeah I don't know

26:32.799 --> 26:34.290
that we're seeing anything here that's

26:34.330 --> 26:36.450
going to be a lot of help

26:36.490 --> 26:39.749
no the ideal situation would be to get

26:39.850 --> 26:41.649
it hooked up to a microscope well it's a

26:41.649 --> 26:44.559
camera do you have a microscope here no

26:44.649 --> 26:47.479
oh we don't okay so maybe that's our

26:47.559 --> 26:49.170
next step hopefully you'd be able to

26:49.179 --> 26:51.900
tell us maybe how old it might be or yes

26:51.970 --> 26:54.700
or what it purpose yeah

26:54.700 --> 26:58.200
well for now I think we packed this up

26:58.200 --> 27:01.590
although Alexander Gard is appointed

27:01.600 --> 27:04.049
that Joe Landry was not able to make a

27:04.090 --> 27:07.119
more conclusive evaluation they are now

27:07.149 --> 27:09.449
more convinced than ever that the red

27:09.519 --> 27:12.479
markings on the paper are inked and that

27:12.549 --> 27:14.609
both fragments could be hundreds of

27:14.679 --> 27:17.939
years old I can't thank you guys enough

27:18.009 --> 27:19.539
oh you're welcome really appreciate it

27:19.539 --> 27:22.139
thank you very much

27:23.650 --> 27:27.940
as a new day dawns on Oak Island

27:27.970 --> 27:32.110
all kinds of what dissin bet it is Rick

27:32.140 --> 27:35.080
lagina and Craig tester continue to

27:35.110 --> 27:37.180
carefully examine the spoils being

27:37.180 --> 27:41.280
retrieved from borehole h8

27:52.779 --> 27:55.180
you know he'll know

27:55.330 --> 27:56.599
can is long

27:56.680 --> 27:59.799
[Music]

28:00.560 --> 28:03.040
and fell

28:04.840 --> 28:07.620
keep seeing her go what's going on

28:07.690 --> 28:09.130
we should be ground there and there's

28:09.220 --> 28:11.330
not

28:12.810 --> 28:16.250
the other grounds gone

28:17.190 --> 28:21.160
oh that light over here you see see

28:21.359 --> 28:23.960
right back there

28:24.750 --> 28:26.650
looks crazy in there they're worried we

28:26.789 --> 28:28.950
should be worried

28:28.950 --> 28:34.320
it's Cavin kV is it possible that the h8

28:34.350 --> 28:36.680
shaft has started to collapse in on

28:36.720 --> 28:38.780
itself

28:39.880 --> 28:42.050
we do have some caving in around the

28:42.130 --> 28:44.330
shaft we're starting to get voids under

28:44.350 --> 28:46.070
the oscillator

28:46.130 --> 28:50.230
doll news it looks like it's about 18

28:50.270 --> 28:53.330
inches ish down all the way around and

28:53.330 --> 28:55.050
then it's kind of falling out so we got

28:55.130 --> 28:57.500
a slowdown nothing comforting the more

28:57.650 --> 29:00.460
what you're seeing comforting for Rick

29:00.500 --> 29:03.830
and Craig a cave-in of the h8 shaft is a

29:03.860 --> 29:09.250
potentially devastating development if

29:09.530 --> 29:11.130
the Earth's surrounding the drill site

29:11.150 --> 29:13.710
is severely compromised it could be a

29:13.730 --> 29:16.580
warning sign that a much larger and much

29:16.610 --> 29:18.910
more catastrophic collapse could happen

29:18.980 --> 29:21.610
at any moment

29:24.370 --> 29:28.000
huge collapse but it is you can see that

29:28.070 --> 29:30.130
it's it's moved away from the deck

29:30.200 --> 29:31.940
yeah but this has been Swiss cheese

29:32.030 --> 29:33.370
right so many people have drilled in

29:33.440 --> 29:37.900
here yeah that's not good for the past

29:37.970 --> 29:40.820
two centuries more than 40 bore holes

29:41.000 --> 29:43.450
shafts and tunnels have been dug

29:43.520 --> 29:45.650
throughout the money pit area by

29:45.650 --> 29:47.400
searchers hoping to avoid the booby

29:47.450 --> 29:49.690
traps protecting the bottom of the money

29:49.700 --> 29:53.240
pit as each excavation inevitably failed

29:53.390 --> 29:55.900
due to flooding the holes were filled

29:55.940 --> 29:58.320
back in leaving the ground compromised

29:58.400 --> 30:02.060
and unstable if the cave-in surrounding

30:02.120 --> 30:05.350
a chain continues to expand it could

30:05.360 --> 30:07.210
cause a collapse through the entire

30:07.250 --> 30:09.650
money pit area

30:09.710 --> 30:13.750
the team's search operation

30:16.120 --> 30:18.180
definitely subsiding sir there's no

30:18.220 --> 30:20.310
question about that yeah there there

30:20.380 --> 30:23.680
were all this work all the research and

30:23.710 --> 30:28.080
it may come down to we can't continue

30:29.450 --> 30:33.030
as the team from Erving equipment

30:33.030 --> 30:35.380
limited continues to inspect the cabin

30:35.430 --> 30:37.879
around borehole h8

30:37.980 --> 30:40.529
some fifty miles northeast of Oak Island

30:40.679 --> 30:43.110
in the city of Halifax hello again Joe

30:43.529 --> 30:45.180
nice to see you sir good to see you

30:45.210 --> 30:47.790
Marty lagina and researcher Doug crawl

30:47.880 --> 30:50.390
have arranged to meet once again with

30:50.490 --> 30:53.119
medieval book expert Joe Landry at st.

30:53.190 --> 30:55.880
Mary's University they are hoping that

30:55.919 --> 30:58.299
the high-powered microscopes and other

30:58.380 --> 31:00.890
sophisticated equipment available at the

31:00.899 --> 31:02.990
University will give them valuable

31:03.090 --> 31:05.439
information concerning the small piece

31:05.490 --> 31:07.989
of rag paper recently recovered from the

31:08.039 --> 31:12.209
h h aft well gentlemen furgus Joe let's

31:12.389 --> 31:15.739
do it working with lab technician Fergus

31:15.809 --> 31:18.500
Tweeddale the team will analyze the

31:18.539 --> 31:20.940
paper sample using a polarized light

31:21.000 --> 31:23.930
microscope capable of magnifying objects

31:23.940 --> 31:27.450
up to 400 times their actual size so

31:27.630 --> 31:29.829
we'll start with a 40 times

31:29.850 --> 31:36.890
magnification view of it so there's the

31:36.929 --> 31:40.470
top surface can you go to the edge

31:40.590 --> 31:42.819
Fergus one may be able to see something

31:42.870 --> 31:46.519
more there yeah that's a good idea

31:48.590 --> 31:52.139
who's that that make no red dye right

31:52.139 --> 31:54.490
there you can see yes that's what made

31:54.539 --> 31:55.930
this piece so interesting because it

31:56.490 --> 31:57.580
doesn't seem to have something printed

31:59.230 --> 32:02.819
on it that's the closest thing to fibers

32:02.880 --> 32:05.470
that we've seen so far that's for sure

32:05.519 --> 32:08.199
but I mean this is a ribbed edge so the

32:08.370 --> 32:10.620
orientation probably isn't telling you

32:10.799 --> 32:12.710
anything that's really you know what it

32:12.720 --> 32:15.990
looked like when it was made that's true

32:16.010 --> 32:19.779
I think that if you could go to low

32:19.790 --> 32:21.630
magnification before we leave that one

32:21.679 --> 32:22.470
yeah

32:22.530 --> 32:25.709
[Music]

32:25.870 --> 32:29.320
that's 100 times magnification

32:29.409 --> 32:31.570
almost looks crystalline yeah it does

32:31.620 --> 32:34.619
this crystalline substance that we're

32:34.870 --> 32:35.879
seeing here that you think might be

32:35.919 --> 32:39.100
pigment are their pigments made of

32:39.179 --> 32:41.450
material that would give this appearance

32:41.500 --> 32:43.659
well we certainly know it's early ink

32:43.750 --> 32:46.580
probably a medieval or Renaissance ink

32:46.659 --> 32:50.799
red for instance would be cinnabar

32:50.880 --> 32:55.710
cinnabar as early as the 9th century AD

32:55.799 --> 32:58.209
the red colored mineral known as

32:58.210 --> 33:00.740
Cinnabon was a key component in the

33:00.909 --> 33:03.330
manufacture of a type of ink that was

33:03.340 --> 33:05.799
used throughout medieval Europe most

33:05.830 --> 33:07.840
notably in the production of important

33:07.899 --> 33:11.340
documents and religious manuscripts

33:11.340 --> 33:13.810
could this simple fragment of paper

33:13.840 --> 33:17.529
found in h8 be evidence that it along

33:17.710 --> 33:18.960
with the other pieces of leather

33:19.029 --> 33:21.420
bookbinding recovered from the shaft is

33:21.460 --> 33:26.179
of medieval origin so you're seeing 1300

33:26.320 --> 33:28.339
Stu

33:28.379 --> 33:34.809
1,600 on the outside when somebody like

33:34.839 --> 33:36.559
Joe Landry who basically has been

33:36.609 --> 33:39.669
involved in paper their whole lives says

33:39.759 --> 33:42.229
that it could be medieval an expert's

33:42.369 --> 33:45.069
opinion like that has wait I find that

33:45.129 --> 33:48.939
highly significant all right well thank

33:48.969 --> 33:50.629
you guys really appreciate it welcome

33:50.739 --> 33:52.009
let's appreciate your time

33:52.029 --> 33:56.009
Fergus a pleasure nice meeting you

33:57.500 --> 33:58.980
John if you were to guess how deep would

33:59.090 --> 34:01.520
you say that is around 2 KB more 18

34:01.580 --> 34:02.949
inches definitely over there because

34:03.020 --> 34:04.509
there's about a foot and that looks way

34:04.549 --> 34:07.249
deeper on this side deep enough scare me

34:07.309 --> 34:09.630
worried because they think it's gonna

34:09.649 --> 34:12.708
collapse yeah they're they're worried

34:12.730 --> 34:15.790
it is a tense and critical moment at the

34:15.909 --> 34:18.639
Oak Island money pit as Rick lagina and

34:18.790 --> 34:21.630
Craig tester a way to report from

34:21.639 --> 34:23.480
representatives of Irving equipment

34:23.530 --> 34:25.629
limited about the consequences of the

34:25.780 --> 34:27.380
cave-in that is developed around

34:27.429 --> 34:34.460
borehole h8 any benefit in flying the

34:34.780 --> 34:36.310
oscillator off right now and he can just

34:36.460 --> 34:37.059
keep crabbing

34:37.210 --> 34:38.789
we're not gonna oscillate on that can

34:38.859 --> 34:42.389
anymore it's probably a good plan

34:47.079 --> 34:50.659
so what's your concern so we're gonna

34:50.750 --> 34:53.059
need it stop oscillating on this we can

34:53.059 --> 34:54.529
definitely continue today with the

34:54.559 --> 34:56.480
camera graph oh really yes we can hold

34:56.629 --> 34:58.739
but we want to go forward with caution

34:58.880 --> 35:00.959
yes the worst case scenario would be to

35:01.039 --> 35:03.479
continue here compromise the integrity

35:03.559 --> 35:05.759
here in this general area it's

35:05.779 --> 35:08.190
concerning enough that I think we're

35:08.359 --> 35:09.800
doing the right thing but it's not

35:09.890 --> 35:12.170
concerning enough that we're evacuating

35:12.200 --> 35:13.639
and run everyone's moving out of here

35:13.670 --> 35:14.459
right this minute

35:14.539 --> 35:15.850
but as long as we're getting full

35:15.859 --> 35:17.360
buckets and we're still bringing up wood

35:17.450 --> 35:19.370
and things like we want to keep going ok

35:19.460 --> 35:21.099
hard to walk away right now

35:21.170 --> 35:25.070
yeah because continuing to oscillate the

35:25.099 --> 35:27.380
a chain shaft would risk a larger and

35:27.470 --> 35:29.350
potentially more dangerous collapse

35:29.480 --> 35:32.429
underground Rick and Craig are hoping

35:32.450 --> 35:34.960
that by carefully excavating a chain

35:35.029 --> 35:37.680
with a three-ton hammer grab tool they

35:37.760 --> 35:39.929
may still be able to recover important

35:39.980 --> 35:42.459
clues or treasure without causing

35:42.529 --> 35:45.730
further damage the good news is the hole

35:45.859 --> 35:49.710
is not increasing neither in depth nor

35:49.730 --> 35:52.809
width so I'm thinking this is a very

35:52.910 --> 35:55.570
localized subsidence and we can deal

35:55.609 --> 36:00.060
with it so I'm quite happy about that

36:00.070 --> 36:04.260
let's start hammer grabbing again

36:08.600 --> 36:11.740
later that night after receiving an

36:11.820 --> 36:14.640
urgent call from Charles Barkhouse Rick

36:14.640 --> 36:16.730
lagina hurries to the money pit drill

36:16.740 --> 36:24.290
site yeah looking at here piece of stone

36:24.330 --> 36:30.370
cave in there the cabin that occurred

36:30.390 --> 36:33.220
around the h8 shaft earlier today has

36:33.270 --> 36:36.070
suddenly become a much larger sinkhole a

36:36.120 --> 36:38.790
sinkhole that is now growing at an

36:38.970 --> 36:43.210
alarming rate you can hear rumblings

36:43.290 --> 36:46.100
underground and I have no idea what's

36:46.110 --> 36:49.210
about to happen let's go take a look

36:49.400 --> 36:51.090
let's do this

36:51.110 --> 36:53.970
Eisen boots I agree we know the

36:54.090 --> 36:56.310
integrity of the earth if you will is

36:56.370 --> 37:00.430
you know it's compromised Oh baby

37:00.510 --> 37:03.530
be careful

37:04.500 --> 37:06.660
Valis you

37:06.710 --> 37:09.860
[Music]

37:12.130 --> 37:15.750
hang on one second

37:22.410 --> 37:26.240
I'm worried I'll be honest with you I my

37:26.320 --> 37:30.240
thoughts run - we may be done

37:36.690 --> 37:41.579
[Music]

37:44.140 --> 37:46.510
after a harrowing and near sleepless

37:46.600 --> 37:48.910
night on Oak Island brothers Rick and

37:48.910 --> 37:51.580
Marty lagina along with their partner

37:51.610 --> 37:54.210
Craig tester and Dave Blankenship make

37:54.580 --> 37:56.140
their way back to the money pit area

37:56.310 --> 37:59.000
they have come to see if the sinkhole

37:59.140 --> 38:01.460
that opened up at the AJ drill site has

38:01.600 --> 38:04.730
gotten any worse how bad last night when

38:04.960 --> 38:09.030
I got there it was about six feet across

38:09.030 --> 38:12.610
I called Mike dirty he arranged to have

38:12.730 --> 38:15.850
two of his crew come they moved the

38:15.910 --> 38:17.640
crane I moved the excavator in the

38:17.650 --> 38:18.890
backhoe because there was some thought

38:18.940 --> 38:20.840
that it was gonna continue to subside

38:20.890 --> 38:23.930
you know when Danny came this morning he

38:24.040 --> 38:26.770
had ideas that the case was gonna be

38:26.830 --> 38:28.550
like this then yeah sure sure the

38:28.570 --> 38:30.460
powerpack could be hanging by the hoses

38:30.550 --> 38:32.630
off of the oscillator well let's go have

38:33.160 --> 38:33.989
a look

38:34.030 --> 38:37.889
[Music]

38:38.869 --> 38:42.579
you do to our whole gentleman everything

38:42.630 --> 38:45.709
is your fault you realize hey guys hey

38:45.779 --> 38:49.309
alright let's have a look alright

38:49.579 --> 38:51.100
how bad

38:51.119 --> 38:55.299
eight feet deep but loving feet across

38:55.400 --> 38:58.719
this fell in last night peace just fell

38:58.799 --> 39:01.299
right in its undermined already careful

39:01.319 --> 39:04.139
it is a little dicey on the lip yeah and

39:04.199 --> 39:06.130
I'm glad nobody got hurt boy definitely

39:06.239 --> 39:07.959
found its way to the top yeah good thing

39:08.130 --> 39:09.340
nobody was standing over that when I

39:09.359 --> 39:13.089
went in this is no good the further

39:13.140 --> 39:15.029
collapse of the ground surrounding the

39:15.089 --> 39:17.999
h8 shaft is deeply concerning for Rick

39:18.029 --> 39:20.949
Marty and their partners it could mean

39:20.999 --> 39:23.849
that the entire area is now too unstable

39:23.849 --> 39:27.429
for the 220 ton crane and oscillator to

39:27.449 --> 39:29.729
continue working and that a catastrophic

39:29.729 --> 39:33.099
collapse could be imminent I'll be

39:33.329 --> 39:35.019
honest it was of some concern that we

39:35.099 --> 39:38.730
were in jeopardy I'm worried if we can't

39:38.819 --> 39:41.590
get to that work and get it done

39:41.630 --> 39:44.730
completed we're gonna be in trouble

39:44.790 --> 39:47.100
there are voids underneath here there

39:47.130 --> 39:49.760
are yeah you put a bunch of shafts in

39:49.800 --> 39:51.040
the same area and be pulling them and

39:51.060 --> 39:52.360
moving them and all that stuff one gets

39:52.440 --> 39:54.050
into Sun water you're gonna get settling

39:54.060 --> 39:56.250
we just were eroding it away underneath

39:56.250 --> 39:58.310
there yes there still is a danger at any

39:58.350 --> 40:00.230
time and we will see this yes that's

40:00.810 --> 40:01.150
right

40:01.230 --> 40:03.400
well I hate to say it but one of these

40:03.450 --> 40:04.740
days we're all gonna be standing here

40:04.800 --> 40:07.390
and just disappear it's a decent

40:07.440 --> 40:09.660
possibility at any point that the whole

40:09.690 --> 40:11.710
money pit area could collapse it's not

40:11.760 --> 40:13.710
just lip service when we say safety is

40:13.710 --> 40:15.720
paramount out here I mean this is a very

40:15.810 --> 40:17.460
dangerous place it's a very dangerous

40:17.520 --> 40:19.780
undertaking and we have to minimize it

40:19.860 --> 40:22.010
we're all about safety Ricky said it a

40:22.080 --> 40:23.230
million times we're not gonna do

40:23.310 --> 40:23.940
anything foolish

40:24.030 --> 40:26.020
okay well then the key is to wait for

40:26.040 --> 40:27.990
the engineer to come render an opinion

40:28.020 --> 40:32.660
and hopefully proceed so that's the plan

40:32.690 --> 40:36.270
guys for Rick Marty and the Oak Island

40:36.360 --> 40:39.490
team a week that began with great

40:39.570 --> 40:41.720
promise now ends with the most

40:41.790 --> 40:43.610
devastating setback they've ever

40:43.620 --> 40:46.710
experienced but is the money pit area

40:46.710 --> 40:49.090
collapsing as the result of more than

40:49.110 --> 40:51.370
two centuries of searchers digging here

40:51.390 --> 40:54.380
or is something more mysterious and

40:54.470 --> 40:57.420
perilous happening like the flood

40:57.480 --> 40:59.790
tunnels could Rick and Marty have

40:59.820 --> 41:01.800
encountered yet another ingeniously

41:01.890 --> 41:04.800
designed booby trap one that was set to

41:04.800 --> 41:08.700
be triggered if anyone got too close if

41:08.700 --> 41:11.650
so perhaps it is a sign that the

41:11.700 --> 41:13.870
brothers are closer than they think to

41:13.950 --> 41:17.210
solving this 223 year old mystery a

41:17.270 --> 41:20.590
mystery whose origins might be linked to

41:20.610 --> 41:23.440
a simple piece of paper placed there for

41:23.490 --> 41:24.840
safekeeping

41:24.840 --> 41:29.699
centuries ago next time on the curse of

41:29.740 --> 41:31.000
Oak Island

41:31.099 --> 41:32.809
it's time to redo the dye test we're

41:32.900 --> 41:34.279
gonna get everybody lined out here real

41:34.309 --> 41:36.059
quick see if that red dye comes out and

41:36.079 --> 41:40.059
we're we're ready to begin let's do this

41:42.700 --> 41:44.779
there's no treasure in the world worth

41:44.960 --> 41:46.550
anyone getting perfect there's some

41:46.579 --> 41:50.409
weird anomaly in the water one is if we

41:50.450 --> 41:52.259
get red dye is this cold I might be

41:52.309 --> 41:52.989
gonna believer

41:53.059 --> 41:57.489
oh I think I see it that's the red guy
