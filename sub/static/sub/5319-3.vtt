04:58.685 --> 05:01.465
- Aryan Brotherhood?
- Not anymore.

05:01.515 --> 05:03.835
I've been washed in the water.

05:03.885 --> 05:06.205
Okay. Where do you want me to start?

05:06.255 --> 05:07.675
This one.

05:10.395 --> 05:14.045
I can fix that. Have a seat.

05:21.435 --> 05:23.055
All right, close your eyes.

05:25.645 --> 05:27.355
- Deep breath.
- Mm hmm.

05:27.405 --> 05:29.665
Here we go.

05:42.755 --> 05:45.045
Wow.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.585
Cork Club and Blue Label
in the middle of the day?

05:47.635 --> 05:49.115
Must be nice.

05:49.165 --> 05:51.315
I can get more business
done in this room in an hour

05:51.365 --> 05:52.985
than in a month at City Hall.

05:53.035 --> 05:55.225
It's amazing how complicated men

05:55.275 --> 05:58.025
find simple answers when
they're sitting face-to-face.

05:58.075 --> 05:59.655
Thank you.

05:59.705 --> 06:01.265
With that said,

06:01.315 --> 06:04.135
I hear making Pernell's
judicial conduct hearing go away

06:04.185 --> 06:06.335
would be as simple as you
pulling your grievance.

06:06.385 --> 06:09.035
Well, that's not simple at
all. Not after what he did.

06:09.085 --> 06:11.535
You act like he fucked your wife.

06:11.585 --> 06:13.335
He humiliated me in open court

06:13.385 --> 06:16.545
and let a violent offender
out on the streets.

06:16.595 --> 06:18.045
If he'd fucked my wife,

06:18.095 --> 06:20.275
we could have at least
kept that between us.

06:21.595 --> 06:23.045
So he has to pay with his career?

06:23.095 --> 06:24.855
A suspension won't ruin his career,

06:24.905 --> 06:26.855
and I'm not going to apologize

06:26.905 --> 06:28.825
for doing what's best for the city.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.355
I don't think you know
what's best for the city.

06:30.405 --> 06:32.655
I don't think you know what's best for you.

06:33.715 --> 06:35.225
That sounds like a threat.

06:35.275 --> 06:36.625
Really?

06:36.675 --> 06:38.595
I need to work on my inflections.

06:38.645 --> 06:39.965
It was meant to sound like an offer.

06:40.015 --> 06:41.965
I know you want to get that "assistant"

06:42.015 --> 06:43.735
out from in front of your title,

06:43.785 --> 06:46.105
and Pernell and I can help
with that in the next election.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.845
I don't need any pie-in-the-sky promises.

06:47.895 --> 06:50.675
I want an apology, from
Pernell, on the record,

06:50.725 --> 06:53.175
in front of the presiding judge.

06:53.225 --> 06:56.585
And I want proof he's seeing a psychiatrist

06:56.635 --> 06:57.985
because from what I saw,

06:58.035 --> 07:00.685
Pernell really does need help.

07:00.735 --> 07:02.925
That simple enough for you?

07:50.755 --> 07:52.775
There's no sign of Julio,

07:52.825 --> 07:55.245
and there's a week's
worth of mail up there.

07:55.295 --> 07:56.945
Fuck.

07:58.265 --> 07:59.815
He's got to come back, right?

07:59.865 --> 08:01.245
I mean, at some point.

08:01.295 --> 08:02.685
I... I don't know.

08:02.735 --> 08:04.255
I mean, I'll keep waiting if you want.

08:04.305 --> 08:06.055
That's what I want.

08:07.705 --> 08:08.855
That's the only way we're gonna find out

08:08.905 --> 08:11.525
who ordered the rape.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.665
What about the book?

08:13.715 --> 08:15.725
Gene said a book was stolen.

08:15.775 --> 08:19.035
Maybe we should look into that piece.

08:19.085 --> 08:21.105
Fuck.

08:21.155 --> 08:23.535
I'm sorry, did I say something wrong?

08:23.585 --> 08:26.805
No, it's not that.

08:26.855 --> 08:29.375
It's just who I got to ask.

08:40.065 --> 08:41.255
Jocelyn, hang on a second.

08:41.304 --> 08:43.054
I need to ask you about something.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.795
- I can't talk to you.
- It's about PJ, please.

08:44.845 --> 08:46.355
I'm not talking to you.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.965
Was there a book stolen from your house?

08:50.015 --> 08:52.935
What the hell does that have to do with PJ?

08:52.985 --> 08:54.335
The night everything happened,

08:54.385 --> 08:55.935
I think there might
have been a book stolen.

08:55.985 --> 08:58.305
- Do you know anything about...
- What are you doing?

08:58.355 --> 08:59.805
You can go in.

09:00.755 --> 09:02.145
Excuse me.

09:06.665 --> 09:08.715
Do not talk directly to her again.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.285
She's my daughter-in-law.

09:10.335 --> 09:11.885
No, she's my client,

09:11.935 --> 09:15.525
and anything you have
to say, you say it to me.

09:15.575 --> 09:19.795
The goal here is to settle
this without going to court.

09:19.845 --> 09:23.195
We know none of us want to
hash this out in a public venue.

09:23.245 --> 09:25.335
Oh, you mean like a press conference?

09:25.385 --> 09:27.065
Miss Harris, please.

09:27.115 --> 09:29.565
I'd like us to observe
the spirit of compromise.

09:29.615 --> 09:34.775
Let's try to remember, you're
all here because you love PJ.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.605
Mr. Tramble, can you start us off?

09:37.655 --> 09:39.615
Thank you, Judge Stanton.

09:39.665 --> 09:42.315
Every medical expert
we've spoken with agrees,

09:42.365 --> 09:44.285
Pernell Harris Jr.'s brain activity

09:44.335 --> 09:46.455
is far below the threshold
for sustaining life.

09:46.505 --> 09:49.085
Even though he shot himself,
he is still breathing.

09:49.135 --> 09:50.895
He's not breathing. It's a machine.

09:50.945 --> 09:52.125
We have our experts too.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.395
Pernell, let me handle this.

09:53.445 --> 09:55.895
They say that that
bullet was one millimeter

09:55.945 --> 09:57.935
away from killing PJ instantly.

09:57.985 --> 09:59.665
- Pernell.
- One millimeter!

09:59.715 --> 10:00.765
That's God's work.

10:00.815 --> 10:02.405
You're out of your mind.

10:02.455 --> 10:05.305
Pernell, you need to
let Mr. Tramble finish.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.835
You want him to be
quiet? She won't shut up.

10:06.885 --> 10:08.075
Let's all be quiet.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.875
Pernell, you will get your chance.

10:09.925 --> 10:11.745
You keep on calling him Pernell.

10:11.795 --> 10:13.415
I...

10:13.465 --> 10:15.345
well, did you want me to call you Nick?

10:15.395 --> 10:18.385
No, we're not friends.
You and Mr. Harris are.

10:18.435 --> 10:20.085
Is that going to be a problem for you?

10:20.135 --> 10:22.455
I mean, if he had been holding
the gun with two hands...

10:22.505 --> 10:24.025
I can't... I'm not gonna
be listening to him.

10:24.075 --> 10:25.955
If he had been standing,
he'd be dead by now.

10:26.005 --> 10:27.525
It's a miracle he's even in a coma.

10:27.575 --> 10:29.395
- Rehashing that.
- Pern... Mr. Harris, please.

10:29.445 --> 10:32.335
Well, I'm curious, Mr. Harris,
how would you define alive?

10:32.385 --> 10:35.435
The quest for fulfillment?
The pursuit of happiness?

10:35.485 --> 10:36.965
That certainly doesn't apply to PJ.

10:37.015 --> 10:38.405
Is that really necessary?

10:38.455 --> 10:40.875
Fine, we'll stick to
the medical definitions.

10:40.925 --> 10:42.405
No sign of corneal reflex.

10:42.455 --> 10:44.875
No reaction to oculovestibular tests.

10:44.925 --> 10:47.845
Negative results from MRI and CT scans.

10:47.895 --> 10:48.915
Minimal respiratory efforts...

10:48.965 --> 10:51.285
His heart is beating.

10:51.335 --> 10:54.185
When I hold his hand, I can feel his pulse.

10:54.235 --> 10:58.125
When I sing to him, I know he can hear me.

10:58.175 --> 11:00.555
I... I don't know what an ocular...

11:00.605 --> 11:02.725
whatever that test is.

11:02.775 --> 11:05.395
I know my son's alive.

11:05.445 --> 11:09.365
Well, that's very powerful, Mrs. Harris,

11:09.415 --> 11:12.835
but a mother's intuition carries
no weight in the courtroom.

11:12.885 --> 11:14.105
Pernell!

11:14.155 --> 11:15.575
You heartless piece of shit.

11:15.625 --> 11:16.845
Sit down!

11:16.895 --> 11:18.845
All right, that's it.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.515
We're done here.

11:22.395 --> 11:23.985
I'm barely okay with an apology,

11:24.035 --> 11:25.855
I'm definitely not seeing a shrink.

11:25.905 --> 11:27.885
Shrinks are for pussies.

11:27.935 --> 11:30.425
It's just for show, Dad.

11:30.475 --> 11:34.525
Whatever you do for show gets seen.

11:34.575 --> 11:36.265
You miss that appointment,
you get suspended,

11:36.315 --> 11:38.565
Brooks is out of here. That's a promise.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.605
Don't be fu... messing
with my concrete pour.

11:41.655 --> 11:42.905
Fuck Brooks.

11:42.955 --> 11:44.475
You heard about those super cookies

11:44.525 --> 11:46.035
they put on your computer?

11:46.085 --> 11:48.245
They can track when you're
thinking about farting

11:48.295 --> 11:51.445
and make an air freshener
ad pop up on the screen.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.245
That's Brooks.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.985
No, no, no, Dad. No, okay?

11:56.035 --> 11:57.485
That's... that's not Brooks.

11:57.535 --> 11:59.685
Brooks is the first, last, and only option

11:59.735 --> 12:01.955
for keeping the city afloat. That's Brooks.

12:02.005 --> 12:05.295
P, I got a psychiatrist ready to sign off.

12:05.345 --> 12:06.725
All you got to do is
walk in, state your name,

12:06.775 --> 12:07.895
your serial number, and walk out.

12:07.945 --> 12:09.365
Fine.

12:09.415 --> 12:12.635
If that's what puts
this to bed, let's do it.

12:12.685 --> 12:15.365
All right, boys, what'll it be?

12:15.415 --> 12:17.305
Bacon or sausage?

12:17.355 --> 12:19.405
The doc say Pops can't eat fried.

12:19.455 --> 12:22.245
No. Pernell?

12:22.295 --> 12:24.475
Both, please.

12:24.525 --> 12:26.975
If you weren't white, I'd think there was

12:27.025 --> 12:28.945
a mix-up at the hospital.

12:28.995 --> 12:30.415
Go help Papa Gene out.

12:30.465 --> 12:32.655
You know I'm not allowed in his kitchen.

12:32.705 --> 12:34.085
Can you help him out?

12:40.645 --> 12:42.795
Pernell.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.395
I love you. You know I do.

12:44.445 --> 12:46.095
And I can say that man-to-man,

12:46.145 --> 12:47.935
and I can help with anything
if I know what it is,

12:47.985 --> 12:49.605
but I don't know how to be here

12:49.655 --> 12:51.105
for you unless I know
what I'm dealing with.

12:51.155 --> 12:53.235
Well, gee, Bobo, I don't know what to say

12:53.285 --> 12:55.575
unless I know what the
fuck you were talking about.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.405
Shane Caldwell.

12:57.455 --> 12:59.415
They don't think he's
missing. They think he's dead.

12:59.465 --> 13:00.615
Missing, dead.

13:00.665 --> 13:02.615
I told you, I don't
know anything about that.

13:02.665 --> 13:05.455
They got a suspect. His
name's Keith Dennison.

13:07.765 --> 13:08.725
Good.

13:08.775 --> 13:11.355
Good? Come on, man.

13:11.405 --> 13:12.955
He's the reason why
you're up for suspension.

13:13.005 --> 13:14.125
Good? That's all you got?

13:14.175 --> 13:15.665
If Dennison did this,

13:15.715 --> 13:17.395
I'll be very surprised...

13:17.445 --> 13:18.765
and very sorry.

13:21.515 --> 13:23.865
You know who I keep thinking about?

13:23.915 --> 13:25.505
Al Cowlings.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.505
He was just being a pal, giving OJ a ride.

13:27.555 --> 13:29.505
He didn't know the man was
running from the police.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.615
I don't want to be driving the
white Bronco. See what I mean?

13:31.665 --> 13:34.045
This is my best friend
talking to me, right?

13:34.095 --> 13:35.185
You really think I had
something to do with this?

13:35.235 --> 13:36.985
I don't know what to think.

13:37.035 --> 13:39.085
Okay, I don't know what's
going on in your head anymore.

13:39.135 --> 13:40.585
You're so obsessed with
solving this rape...

13:40.635 --> 13:43.255
Damn right I am, man.

13:43.305 --> 13:45.555
If you had a kid hanging by a thread

13:45.605 --> 13:47.325
and you had a chance to
do something about it,

13:47.375 --> 13:48.765
even if it was one in a million,

13:48.815 --> 13:50.265
what would you do?

13:50.315 --> 13:53.095
And you think finding out who raped Jocelyn

13:53.145 --> 13:55.335
is gonna save PJ?

13:55.385 --> 13:57.165
So now I'm really asking,

13:57.215 --> 13:59.275
did you do something to that cop?

14:08.165 --> 14:10.345
I'll see you at the meeting.

14:33.955 --> 14:35.045
- Keith Dennison?
- Yeah?

14:45.265 --> 14:48.725
I drive a 2008 Honda Accord, white.

14:48.775 --> 14:51.795
I see ten just like it
every day on the way in.

14:51.845 --> 14:55.065
I could run you over,

14:55.115 --> 14:57.825
you probably still wouldn't remember it.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.635
If you want to kidnap or murder someone

15:00.685 --> 15:03.165
and not be identified,

15:03.215 --> 15:05.505
you could use my car.

15:06.625 --> 15:11.845
You drive a 1985

15:11.895 --> 15:13.615
Datsun pickup

15:13.665 --> 15:16.215
with body damage that's the color of shit.

15:16.265 --> 15:18.155
It's easy to spot.

15:18.205 --> 15:20.315
Hard to forget.

15:23.005 --> 15:27.425
I know... you took Shane.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.835
I know he's probably dead.

15:32.585 --> 15:36.165
And I know it's just a matter of time

15:36.715 --> 15:39.175
before we track that
ugly-ass truck of yours

15:39.225 --> 15:41.545
to wherever it is you left him.

15:42.425 --> 15:46.375
What I don't know is why.

15:46.925 --> 15:50.545
You didn't know Shane.
Someone put you up to it.

15:50.595 --> 15:53.115
- Am I under arrest?
- Don't go there.

15:53.165 --> 15:55.155
You killed a police officer.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.125
I want to know who you work for.

15:57.175 --> 15:59.455
- Am I under arrest, sir?
- Was it Pernell Harris?

15:59.505 --> 16:01.695
I am a servant of the Lord. Am I und...

16:08.185 --> 16:09.365
This fucker tried to bite me.

16:09.415 --> 16:10.835
Our Father who art in heaven...

16:10.885 --> 16:12.175
I'll turn the recorder off.

16:12.225 --> 16:14.675
Hallowed be thy name.

16:14.725 --> 16:17.475
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

16:17.525 --> 16:20.545
on earth, as it is in heaven.

16:20.595 --> 16:24.485
Give us this day our daily...

16:24.535 --> 16:26.755
Forgive us our trespasses.

16:28.205 --> 16:32.195
As we forgive those... trespass against us!

16:32.245 --> 16:34.525
Lead us not into temptation!

16:35.745 --> 16:37.465
Let me grab it. You make me look bad.

16:37.515 --> 16:40.035
- No, I got it, I got it.
- All right.

16:40.085 --> 16:41.465
I set up a bed in the office.

16:41.515 --> 16:42.935
That's okay, I can sleep on the couch.

16:42.985 --> 16:44.805
I don't want you changing your life around.

16:44.855 --> 16:47.905
- It's called being a good host.
- Oh, come on.

16:50.655 --> 16:51.975
Thank you.

16:54.635 --> 16:57.285
I think it's a good idea,

16:57.335 --> 16:59.055
you getting out of that house.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.515
Yeah.

17:00.565 --> 17:02.185
You can stay as long as you want.

17:02.235 --> 17:04.494
- Thank you.
- You know, I'm here for you.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.095
Yeah, you see, that's...
that's what I mean.

17:06.145 --> 17:09.795
I don't need anybody to be there for me.

17:10.444 --> 17:14.204
I just need a place to stay.

17:14.255 --> 17:18.135
Well, that would be the bed in the office.

17:18.785 --> 17:20.234
Okay, well you can't be nice about it,

17:20.285 --> 17:21.845
you have to be a little bit of a dick,

17:21.895 --> 17:24.775
okay, so I don't feel
like I'm putting you out.

17:24.825 --> 17:26.075
Fine.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.385
No using hot water, no TV after 7:00,

17:28.435 --> 17:31.215
and if I ever find your
hair in my sink, you're out.

17:31.265 --> 17:32.715
I have no tolerance for that shit.

17:32.765 --> 17:34.085
Okay. Good.

17:34.135 --> 17:36.855
Well, I want to make dinner
tonight to say thank you.

17:36.905 --> 17:39.225
So do you have any...
anything in your kitchen

17:39.275 --> 17:43.325
other than batteries and energy drinks?

17:43.875 --> 17:45.895
Maybe butter.

17:45.945 --> 17:48.835
Okay, butter. Do you
have toast or crackers?

17:50.515 --> 17:53.235
In Luke 14, Jesus says,

17:53.285 --> 17:54.975
"When you give a feast,

17:55.025 --> 17:59.275
invite the poor, the
crippled, the lame, the blind,

17:59.325 --> 18:01.785
and you will be blessed."

18:04.305 --> 18:07.515
Now it's time we open our doors

18:07.565 --> 18:10.285
to those who can't repay.

18:10.335 --> 18:14.965
The poor, the addicted,

18:15.015 --> 18:16.595
and the afflicted.

18:32.595 --> 18:35.015
- Amen?
- Amen.

18:35.065 --> 18:36.485
Do you feel God's love?

18:36.535 --> 18:38.815
- Yes.
- I know you do.

18:40.005 --> 18:45.155
Now I remember walking into this building

18:45.205 --> 18:47.595
when it was rat and roach infested.

18:49.075 --> 18:50.495
He's bluffing.

18:50.545 --> 18:51.965
He's trying to trick you into a confession.

18:52.015 --> 18:56.105
No... no, they are gonna
find where I buried Shane,

18:56.155 --> 18:57.965
and it's not gonna take them long.

18:58.015 --> 19:01.605
And once they have that
body, it's all over.

19:02.155 --> 19:03.345
So go move it.

19:03.395 --> 19:04.845
I can't.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.315
They've followed me ever since the station.

19:07.365 --> 19:09.315
I'd be leading them straight to the grave.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.415
Shit.

19:13.535 --> 19:16.485
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

19:16.535 --> 19:19.725
And now look at us.

19:19.775 --> 19:24.865
Hand of God Chapel is a
home we can be proud of,

19:24.915 --> 19:27.735
with a growing and thriving congregation.

19:27.785 --> 19:29.505
- Amen?
- Amen.

19:33.585 --> 19:37.475
So who do we get to move a body?

19:38.225 --> 19:41.985
Judge Harris, it has to be you.

19:45.165 --> 19:47.415
I can't...

19:47.465 --> 19:49.725
I can't dig up a body.

19:49.775 --> 19:53.155
Well...

19:53.205 --> 19:54.565
I can walk you through it.

19:54.615 --> 19:56.525
I don't want you to walk me through it.

19:56.575 --> 19:58.495
Benaiah didn't tell
Solomon how to get it done,

19:58.545 --> 20:00.235
he got it done.

20:00.285 --> 20:04.205
I'm sorry I let you down.

20:04.255 --> 20:05.575
Do you want me to take my chances?

20:05.625 --> 20:07.105
- No.
- I'll slip the cops.

20:07.155 --> 20:08.975
No.

20:09.025 --> 20:10.075
Shit.

20:14.635 --> 20:16.045
I don't want you to be mad at me.

20:16.095 --> 20:18.085
I'm not mad, I'm just...

20:22.505 --> 20:25.155
Now listen, every last one of you.

20:25.205 --> 20:28.725
If you focus on taking,

20:29.875 --> 20:33.135
- you'll never have enough.
- That's right.

20:33.185 --> 20:38.065
But if you focus on giving,

20:38.115 --> 20:40.535
you'll never run out.

20:40.585 --> 20:42.445
- Amen?
- Amen.

20:42.495 --> 20:43.505
Praise Jesus!

20:43.555 --> 20:44.715
Praise Jesus!

20:44.765 --> 20:46.115
- Jesus!
- Saves!

20:46.165 --> 20:47.245
- Jesus!
- Saves!

20:47.295 --> 20:48.515
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

20:48.565 --> 20:50.685
God loves you!

20:52.645 --> 20:54.095
Here.

20:54.145 --> 20:58.505
It's old, but I can make it work.

20:58.555 --> 21:01.705
I'll have it heated up
by the time you get back.

21:01.755 --> 21:03.345
Why don't you start with how I get him here

21:03.395 --> 21:04.445
in the first place?

21:04.495 --> 21:06.715
Well...

21:06.765 --> 21:09.185
you're gonna need a truck or a van,

21:09.235 --> 21:10.915
and you can't rent it.

21:37.695 --> 21:40.175
The grave's gonna be hard to find,

21:40.225 --> 21:44.245
but I left something on top of it.

21:44.295 --> 21:45.655
You left a marker?

21:45.705 --> 21:48.455
Yeah. Shane died a Christian.

21:48.505 --> 21:51.055
He needed a tombstone.

22:34.445 --> 22:36.705
Body's wrapped in plastic.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.405
The moisture makes them rot faster.

22:48.765 --> 22:50.585
He's gonna be heavy.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.055
I'd tie a rope around his waist.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.815
Use the van to pull him out.

23:04.315 --> 23:07.265
Ah!

23:07.315 --> 23:08.735
Fuck!

23:08.785 --> 23:10.265
You motherfucker!

23:10.315 --> 23:13.835
I should be dancing on
your fucking corpse, not...

23:17.295 --> 23:20.475
You know what this is? This is not for you.

23:20.525 --> 23:25.215
I'm glad you're dead. You deserved to die.

23:25.265 --> 23:28.625
But your family? You had to have kids.

23:36.245 --> 23:39.965
They don't deserve... fuck that!

23:40.815 --> 23:42.765
I got a kid too, you know?

23:42.815 --> 23:45.505
And he shot himself 'cause of you.

23:49.225 --> 23:51.775
So don't try to make me the bad guy.

23:51.825 --> 23:54.115
I'm on the right path.

23:54.165 --> 23:55.945
I'm doing the right thing.

24:00.265 --> 24:03.355
So why is it so fucking hard?

24:08.545 --> 24:11.325
Why is it so fucking hard?

25:10.335 --> 25:12.055
Shit!

25:56.015 --> 25:57.305
Jesus Christ!

26:02.455 --> 26:05.015
Fuck you!

27:38.885 --> 27:41.535
Where have you been?

27:41.585 --> 27:46.515
And what the fuck are you driving?

27:46.565 --> 27:48.875
Jesus, you're filthy.

27:48.925 --> 27:51.415
What have you been doing?

27:51.465 --> 27:56.755
I've been... helping out at the church.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.255
Today is not the day.

27:58.305 --> 27:59.695
You have to go in there and get signed off

27:59.745 --> 28:01.795
by Dr. Greenwald, and
then get to the meeting

28:01.845 --> 28:05.735
with McCauley, and then make
sure they don't suspend you.

28:07.415 --> 28:08.795
Pernell?

28:10.685 --> 28:12.535
Look at me.

28:20.425 --> 28:22.445
Sorry, Crys.

28:36.445 --> 28:38.325
Let's get you cleaned up.

28:51.295 --> 28:55.085
You know, we can cancel the appointment.

28:55.135 --> 28:56.645
No.

28:56.695 --> 28:58.545
I can't get suspended.

29:02.705 --> 29:07.525
No. No, you can't.

29:16.615 --> 29:18.765
Oh, Lord,

29:18.815 --> 29:21.905
please let Judge Harris be close.

29:21.955 --> 29:25.315
Guard him with Your
divine protections, Lord,

29:25.365 --> 29:28.415
and guide him here with
the rapist so that we may...

29:30.035 --> 29:33.485
Hey! Hey!

29:34.905 --> 29:36.285
- Ugh.
- You see this?

29:36.335 --> 29:38.155
- I'm sorry, man.
- You see this building?

29:38.205 --> 29:40.495
- It's a church.
- Sorry.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.665
Come here. Come here.

29:45.715 --> 29:47.035
Come here, you fuck.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.695
Lick it up.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.465
Huh?

29:50.515 --> 29:54.175
Lick it up, every drop. Take that.

29:54.925 --> 29:56.045
Take that!

29:56.095 --> 29:58.175
Oh, KD, no!

29:58.225 --> 30:00.815
No! Get off him.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.745
Get the fuck out of here!

30:02.795 --> 30:04.785
Stop! Stop!

30:06.035 --> 30:08.585
- What happened?
- He was pissing on our wall.

30:08.635 --> 30:10.985
And your response is to beat him?

30:11.035 --> 30:13.255
He desecrated a church!

30:13.305 --> 30:16.425
Your job is not to judge.

30:16.475 --> 30:19.165
You don't like him pissing,
you kindly ask him to stop.

30:19.215 --> 30:22.365
Better yet, you invite him
inside to use our facilities.

30:24.115 --> 30:25.875
That's the Christian way.

30:28.955 --> 30:31.705
Now you go get a hose,

30:31.755 --> 30:34.745
and you rinse that wall down.

30:45.005 --> 30:47.255
And how did you feel about that?

30:50.245 --> 30:52.665
What kind of a fucking question is...

30:53.985 --> 30:55.335
Sorry.

30:57.015 --> 30:58.835
I feel like shit.

30:58.885 --> 31:00.905
I have since the day it happened.

31:00.955 --> 31:03.545
Any trouble sleeping?

31:03.595 --> 31:04.375
No.

31:04.425 --> 31:07.815
And how about hallucinations?

31:10.865 --> 31:12.915
No.

31:12.965 --> 31:15.225
I was told about an
incident at a police banquet

31:15.275 --> 31:17.385
a couple of weeks ago.

31:17.435 --> 31:20.055
Please, you have to save me.

31:20.105 --> 31:22.025
If you want to get this over with,

31:22.075 --> 31:24.025
you're gonna have to talk to me.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.565
It's far from over, Dad.

31:26.615 --> 31:29.665
Pernell, are you okay?

31:29.715 --> 31:32.535
No, you're not okay.

31:33.585 --> 31:35.705
You're running out of time.

31:38.425 --> 31:39.645
I don't...

31:40.565 --> 31:42.145
I don't understand.

31:42.195 --> 31:43.645
What are you asking of me?

31:44.495 --> 31:47.655
Why did you just say "PJ"?

31:50.775 --> 31:53.255
Well, 'cause that's why
I'm here, Doc, right?

31:53.305 --> 31:56.925
Talk about my son? Talk about PJ?

31:56.975 --> 32:00.265
Actually, I think this
goes deeper than that.

32:00.315 --> 32:02.905
You're focusing on the wrong thing.

32:02.955 --> 32:05.405
Well, what the fuck
should I be focusing on?

32:05.455 --> 32:07.275
Well, why don't you tell me, Pernell?

32:07.325 --> 32:08.675
Who are you really mad at?

32:08.725 --> 32:10.775
Julio. You have to bring him back.

32:10.825 --> 32:12.675
I think it starts with figuring out

32:12.725 --> 32:14.175
where to put all of the anger.

32:14.225 --> 32:15.585
Put the body where it belongs.

32:15.635 --> 32:17.615
The rest will fall into place.

32:17.665 --> 32:20.385
Where? Where do I put it?

32:20.435 --> 32:22.155
Well, that's the puzzle, isn't it?

32:22.205 --> 32:25.025
You've seen all the pieces.

32:28.045 --> 32:29.495
Pernell?

32:30.675 --> 32:32.895
Pernell, I need you to sit back down.

32:44.225 --> 32:45.875
What are you looking at?

32:45.925 --> 32:47.745
What do you see?

32:50.235 --> 32:52.415
Put the body where it belongs.

32:54.365 --> 32:55.985
Holy shit.

32:58.705 --> 33:01.755
No, no, you can't leave him at Julio's.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.025
I have to.

33:03.075 --> 33:04.825
What if someone finds him?

33:06.615 --> 33:08.665
- They won't.
- They might.

33:08.715 --> 33:12.505
If we burn him, there is no evidence.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.205
There is no trail.

33:14.255 --> 33:16.205
There's no him anymore.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.645
Let... let me go get him out.

33:18.695 --> 33:21.875
That is not what God wants, Keith.

33:21.925 --> 33:23.915
Maybe you misunderstood the message.

33:23.965 --> 33:25.045
You said just...

33:28.865 --> 33:31.555
You believe I'm anointed, right?

33:31.605 --> 33:34.455
I'm your Solomon. You believe that?

33:34.505 --> 33:37.725
- I do, but...
- Well, then fucking trust me.

33:39.885 --> 33:43.865
This is what God wants. I'm sure of it.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.105
He needs to be in a hospital.

33:51.155 --> 33:52.915
Uh, we... we can't.

33:52.965 --> 33:56.515
I... I'm sure Mayor Boston talked to you.

33:56.565 --> 33:58.515
He explained everything.

33:58.565 --> 33:59.985
And I will keep my end of the bargain.

34:00.035 --> 34:03.155
You can take this to the
meeting with McCauley.

34:48.745 --> 34:51.565
Oh, for fuck's sake.

34:58.225 --> 34:59.815
Oh, my God.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.445
Oh, shit!

35:20.115 --> 35:23.605
I waited 45 minutes just
to see if you'd show up.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.875
Sorry, Crys.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.845
I really tried to make it.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.775
No, you didn't. You fucking lied to me.

35:34.825 --> 35:37.885
And now McCauley is moving
forward with the review,

35:37.935 --> 35:41.555
and you are definitely getting suspended.

35:44.705 --> 35:47.155
Not that you seem to give a shit.

35:59.725 --> 36:03.045
No, it is not the same jacket.

36:03.095 --> 36:05.645
I can't believe you kept
it, let alone wore it.

36:05.695 --> 36:07.315
It holds a special place.

36:07.365 --> 36:09.585
How many times in your life is
a woman gonna set you on fire?

36:09.635 --> 36:12.285
Mm, mm-mm-mm.

36:12.335 --> 36:15.585
Oh. Two drink limit?

36:16.435 --> 36:18.025
So this is business.

36:18.075 --> 36:21.425
Just because I want to
talk to you about the case

36:21.475 --> 36:25.125
does not mean I'm not here to enjoy myself.

36:25.175 --> 36:26.435
I need this.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.935
Wow.

36:28.985 --> 36:31.165
You even stuck the landing.

36:33.955 --> 36:35.875
You can be an asshole all you want,

36:35.925 --> 36:38.545
but you used to care about me.

36:38.595 --> 36:40.875
That's got to be worth one favor.

36:40.925 --> 36:42.745
You're talking to the wrong guy.

36:42.795 --> 36:45.755
Your husband can make all of
this go away in a heartbeat.

36:48.605 --> 36:49.925
We lost our son.

36:49.975 --> 36:54.255
We're just trying to find a way through it.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.095
Even if you hate Pernell,
you can understand that.

36:57.145 --> 36:59.465
You think this case is about his grieving?

36:59.515 --> 37:01.665
Because I see the same old guy

37:01.715 --> 37:03.305
who's used to getting whatever he wants.

37:03.355 --> 37:06.405
And right now, what he wants
is to control PJ's fate,

37:06.455 --> 37:09.745
and everybody around him
is suffering because of it.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.205
Jocelyn, PJ...

37:12.255 --> 37:13.315
you.

37:14.955 --> 37:17.805
The body in that hospital is not your son.

37:17.855 --> 37:21.045
It's an anchor keeping you from moving on.

37:21.095 --> 37:24.045
I know you feel the same way.

37:27.035 --> 37:29.915
People have woken up from comas before.

37:29.965 --> 37:32.315
Maybe there's a chance.

37:35.875 --> 37:38.795
I need you to give me that chance.

37:38.845 --> 37:41.695
That's very touching,

37:41.745 --> 37:44.165
but I can tell when you're faking it.

37:50.785 --> 37:52.475
Excuse me.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.185
Come here.

38:13.775 --> 38:15.735
Mm... stop, stop.

38:15.785 --> 38:18.595
We cannot do this again.

38:21.215 --> 38:23.175
But you want to.

38:23.225 --> 38:25.945
Maybe... maybe if things were different.

38:25.995 --> 38:27.275
If things were different,

38:27.325 --> 38:29.915
I'd have your underwear off by now.

38:33.795 --> 38:35.415
Then what would you do?

38:37.805 --> 38:40.055
I'd lift up your skirt,

38:40.105 --> 38:43.625
feel how wet you are.

38:45.445 --> 38:48.325
- You think I'd be wet?
- You're wet right now.

38:50.515 --> 38:54.305
I'd pull you towards me. Unzip your pants.

38:54.355 --> 38:56.805
I'd press you up against the wall,

38:56.855 --> 38:59.105
make you feel how hard I am.

38:59.155 --> 39:00.805
I'd take you inside me.

39:00.855 --> 39:04.915
I'd go slow at first.

39:06.095 --> 39:10.185
Make you feel every... inch.

39:13.275 --> 39:16.255
I'd want to taste you before it was over.

39:19.845 --> 39:24.335
I'd take your cock... your beautiful cock,

39:24.385 --> 39:28.405
in both my hands,

39:28.455 --> 39:31.035
and I would suck it so hard,

39:31.085 --> 39:34.175
you'd pay rent to have it live in my mouth.

39:36.195 --> 39:40.545
And just when you were about to come...

39:44.735 --> 39:48.225
I... would tell you...

39:50.605 --> 39:52.525
Tell me, Crystal.

39:54.875 --> 39:57.165
I'd tell you...

40:00.455 --> 40:03.305
Drop the fucking case.

40:24.745 --> 40:27.365
Josh?

40:29.855 --> 40:31.035
Josh?

40:39.065 --> 40:41.585
Ah! Jocelyn!

40:41.635 --> 40:43.185
Josh?

40:43.235 --> 40:44.915
- Josh, is that you?
- It's me!

40:44.965 --> 40:47.655
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- It's me! It's me! Fuck.

40:47.705 --> 40:49.185
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

40:49.235 --> 40:50.925
You just fucking shot at me!

40:50.975 --> 40:52.125
Sorry, I didn't hear that
you left, and I thought...

40:52.175 --> 40:53.825
Sorry? You almost killed me!

40:53.875 --> 40:55.195
Put the fucking thing down, please.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.635
Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

40:56.685 --> 40:59.435
Why... how could you buy a gun like that

40:59.485 --> 41:00.765
after what PJ did?

41:00.815 --> 41:02.005
I didn't buy it.

41:05.985 --> 41:08.305
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

41:08.355 --> 41:10.105
That's... that's the gun.

41:10.155 --> 41:12.615
That's PJ's gun! Oh, my God.

41:12.665 --> 41:14.885
Oh, that's fucking sick.

41:14.935 --> 41:16.855
- That thing killed PJ.
- I know.

41:16.905 --> 41:18.515
Then why the fuck did you keep it?

41:18.565 --> 41:19.715
- I don't know.
- Bullshit.

41:19.765 --> 41:21.955
- I don't know.
- Why... why?

41:22.005 --> 41:23.525
Because I made him buy it.

41:24.805 --> 41:25.925
After what happened,

41:25.975 --> 41:27.265
we upgraded the alarm system,

41:27.315 --> 41:28.795
but you can't... you couldn't feel it.

41:28.845 --> 41:30.565
You couldn't touch it, you know, so I...

41:30.615 --> 41:33.535
I told him to buy a gun.

41:33.585 --> 41:35.465
I'm the reason that he had it.

41:35.515 --> 41:37.835
No.

41:37.885 --> 41:39.335
What he did with it,

41:39.385 --> 41:41.475
that was his choice, not yours.

41:43.055 --> 41:44.915
We've got to get rid of it.

41:44.965 --> 41:46.345
I tried. I can't.

41:46.395 --> 41:48.945
All right, well, then you let me.

41:59.845 --> 42:02.295
Holy shit.

43:00.135 --> 43:03.625
Hey.

43:07.775 --> 43:09.995
I said you had to wait a
couple weeks, remember that?

43:10.045 --> 43:12.365
Mm.

43:12.415 --> 43:13.635
What happens if I don't?

43:13.685 --> 43:15.205
It's gonna hurt like hell.

43:19.425 --> 43:21.205
I'm okay with that.

43:21.255 --> 43:22.805
I want this off me now.

43:36.175 --> 43:38.925
Okay. Come on.

43:40.575 --> 43:43.635
But if you cry on my table, I charge extra.

43:45.085 --> 43:48.735
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

43:50.785 --> 43:52.935
6, 7,

43:52.985 --> 43:54.945
8, 9,

43:54.995 --> 43:58.415
10, 11, 12, 13,

43:58.465 --> 44:01.185
14, 15, 16,

44:01.235 --> 44:04.755
17, 18, 19, 20.

44:05.305 --> 44:06.955
Ready or not, here I come.
