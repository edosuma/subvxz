WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.030
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

00:04.137 --> 00:05.536
of the Starship Voyager.

00:05.605 --> 00:07.266
We're responding
to your distress call.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.568
A ruptured conduit
is flooding my ship

00:09.642 --> 00:10.939
with plasma radiation.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.603
We request immediate transport.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.512
l'm detecting 1 1 life-signs;
two are weak.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.550
Transport the injured
to Sick Bay

00:17.617 --> 00:19.744
and the rest to Cargo Bay 1.

00:19.819 --> 00:22.083
l want security teams
at both locations.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.318
Our weapons!

00:30.397 --> 00:32.262
They'll be returned
to you when you leave.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.527
These are dangerous criminals.
They have to be secured.

00:34.634 --> 00:36.966
We'll do our best
to accommodate you.

00:37.070 --> 00:38.765
l had eight men in custody.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.396
Where are the other two?

00:40.507 --> 00:41.974
We're not going to hurt you.

00:42.142 --> 00:43.700
Stay away, or l'll kill her!

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.356 --> 02:38.950
l'm sure we can resolve this

02:39.092 --> 02:40.855
without resorting
to violence.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.758
What is it you want?

02:42.829 --> 02:45.491
A ship, some food.

02:45.565 --> 02:46.930
l might be able
to arrange that,

02:47.033 --> 02:48.660
but you'll have
to release her first.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.258
l'm not a fool.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.770
You know l'll do it! Tell them.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.537
You're not getting
off this ship.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.577
lf you release her,

02:58.645 --> 03:00.169
l promise you
won't be harmed.

03:00.246 --> 03:02.840
Not until l get a ship.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.315
We don't negotiate
with criminals.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.442
Who are you?

03:05.518 --> 03:08.282
Warden Yediq of the
Nygean Detention Force.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.878
This man is my prisoner.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.685
lf that were true, he wouldn't
be holding my friend hostage.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.727
Get back!

03:17.797 --> 03:20.027
l'm a hologram.
l can't be harmed.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.894
l think you proved my point.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.835
We're lucky you came
along, Captain.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.135
Ten more minutes

03:29.209 --> 03:31.370
and none of us would have
survived the plasma leak.

03:31.444 --> 03:33.173
Your vessel was equipped
with escape pods.

03:33.246 --> 03:34.679
Why didn't you use them?

03:34.747 --> 03:37.545
l couldn't risk letting
any of the prisoners get away.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.915
As you've seen,
they're extremely dangerous.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.112
Where are you taking them?

03:41.187 --> 03:42.620
Back to our homeworld.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.384
They're due to be executed.

03:47.126 --> 03:50.061
What were their crimes?

03:50.129 --> 03:51.858
All eight are murderers.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.058
Three are
multiple offenders.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.966
We're just 13 light-years
from our system.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.436
l'd appreciate it
if you'd take us back there.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.496
Actually, we were headed
in the opposite direction.

04:01.608 --> 04:02.870
l could arrange

04:02.942 --> 04:05.103
for one of our ships
to rendezvous with Voyager.

04:05.178 --> 04:07.339
lt'll take several days.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.711
My prisoners will have
to be strictly monitored.

04:09.782 --> 04:13.013
Commander Tuvok will help you
make arrangements.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.724
Some of the crew
may not be comfortable

04:22.795 --> 04:24.888
helping to deliver
eight men to their deaths.

04:24.964 --> 04:27.228
l can't say l
like it, either...

04:27.300 --> 04:30.292
but we have a Prime
Directive to follow.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.599
30 more seconds,

04:33.706 --> 04:36.470
and l could have resolved
the situation peacefully.

04:36.542 --> 04:38.669
lnstead, you and ''Tuvok the Kid''

04:38.745 --> 04:40.872
had to take matters
into your own hands.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.244
You're damaged.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.878
Commander Tuvok's
friendly fire

04:44.951 --> 04:46.043
must have caused

04:46.119 --> 04:47.518
a feedback surge in my emitters.

04:47.587 --> 04:48.679
l'll help you repair it.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.190
How are you?

04:52.258 --> 04:53.657
Fine, Captain.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.523
You!

04:55.595 --> 04:57.187
This your ship?

04:57.263 --> 04:59.959
Yes.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.558
Then let me out.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.899
l'm afraid l can't do that.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.016
lf you don't, l'll kill you all.

05:20.920 --> 05:21.887
Janeway to Tuvok.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.546
Are the prisoners'
accommodations ready?

05:24.624 --> 05:26.353
Affirmative, Captain.

05:26.426 --> 05:29.623
Then by all means,
initiate transport.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.037
You're sure
these will hold them?

05:38.137 --> 05:40.503
The force fields
are impenetrable,

05:40.573 --> 05:42.438
as are the tritanium bulkheads.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.941
ln addition to your staff,

05:44.077 --> 05:45.840
two Voyager
security officers

05:45.912 --> 05:47.675
will remain here
at all times.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.408
Two more will be posted

05:49.482 --> 05:51.882
at the entrance
to the cargo bay.

05:51.951 --> 05:52.918
What about our weapons?

05:52.985 --> 05:54.850
You'll be allowed
to carry them

05:54.921 --> 05:55.945
in this area only.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.716
lf you leave the cargo bay,

05:57.790 --> 05:59.758
you'll be asked
to surrender them.

05:59.826 --> 06:00.884
What's this?

06:00.993 --> 06:02.119
Dinner.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.686
Since you can't bring
the prisoners to the Mess Hall,

06:04.764 --> 06:06.322
l brought the Mess Hall
to them.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.492
What is it?

06:08.601 --> 06:11.832
Talaxian Spice Stew
served over leola rice pilaf.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.801
lt's an old family recipe.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.500
Take it back.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.277
Too spicy?

06:18.344 --> 06:19.811
These men don't deserve

06:19.879 --> 06:22.245
such an elaborate meal.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.509
Take it back.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.517
Federation guidelines
are quite clear

06:25.585 --> 06:27.348
about the treatment
of prisoners.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.387
He is correct.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.716
l can quote the protocols,

06:29.789 --> 06:31.313
if you like.

06:36.028 --> 06:37.757
My men will assist you.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.517
Thanks for standing
up to Yediq.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.749
Just doing my job.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.052
Still,

07:06.125 --> 07:07.854
it was kind.

07:14.634 --> 07:19.731
This would be easier
if you would remain stationary.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.431
lt doesn't feel right.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.509
You may experience
unusual sensations

07:23.609 --> 07:25.133
while your matrix realigns.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.441
l was referring
to the ''arrangement''

07:27.513 --> 07:29.777
the Captain's made
with the Nygeans.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.477
No matter how terrible
the crimes these men committed,

07:32.552 --> 07:34.884
it seems wrong to hand them over
to be executed.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.888
This is a Federation starship,
not the Barge of the Dead.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.982
Would you have preferred
the Captain release them?

07:40.059 --> 07:41.651
Of course not.
They're dangerous men.

07:41.727 --> 07:42.819
Executing them ensures

07:42.895 --> 07:44.624
they'll never pose a
threat to anyone again.

07:44.697 --> 07:47.996
So would life sentences...
the operative word being ''life.''

07:48.067 --> 07:51.161
Confining them for life
requires significant resources.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.534
The Nygeans may not
think it worthwhile.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.766
What about rehabilitation?

07:54.874 --> 07:57.138
Given the chance,
some of these men might become

07:57.210 --> 07:58.939
productive members
of society one day.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.912
Their victims won't have
the same opportunity.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.415
And that justifies
taking their lives?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.952
An eye for an eye?

08:07.019 --> 08:09.146
lt's not justice, it's revenge.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.985
Quite frankly, l'm surprised

08:11.057 --> 08:14.083
you're not troubled
by such a barbaric system.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.923
l'm simply being objective.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.394
You often encourage me

08:17.463 --> 08:19.590
to see both sides
of an argument.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.633
Well...

08:21.701 --> 08:26.161
this is one occasion when
my programming won't allow me

08:26.239 --> 08:27.501
to be objective.

08:27.573 --> 08:31.009
Killing is wrong,
no matter who's doing it.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.517
Still hungry?

08:42.587 --> 08:45.284
l can hear your
stomach from here.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.588
This must be
the first time in a month

08:47.660 --> 08:49.890
you couldn't steal
poor Egrid's meal.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.630
Good, isn't it?

08:53.699 --> 08:54.996
Mm-hmm.

09:06.078 --> 09:07.705
ls there a problem?

09:11.584 --> 09:14.553
lko was just telling
me, he didn't get

09:14.620 --> 09:15.882
enough to eat.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.055
l see.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.720
Cause another disturbance

09:24.797 --> 09:26.128
and l'll see to it

09:26.198 --> 09:28.666
you're not fed
the rest of this journey.

09:28.768 --> 09:29.735
Do you understand?

09:32.271 --> 09:35.035
Boche and Ledara...

09:35.107 --> 09:37.075
What did you say?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.074
Your children.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.710
How did you know that?

09:47.787 --> 09:51.450
Are you sure they're safe?

09:51.524 --> 09:53.549
Some people don't understand

09:53.626 --> 09:56.459
why we deal so harshly
with men like you.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.860
lt's because you never learn.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.276
Stand down!

10:17.350 --> 10:20.410
Stand down!

10:20.486 --> 10:22.647
He needs to be disciplined.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.418
Lower your weapons
and step away.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.705
Our response was justified.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.406
How do you justify
beating a defenseless man?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.711
Violence is the only
thing he understands.

10:50.783 --> 10:54.378
You seem to have a pretty good
grasp of it yourself.

10:54.453 --> 10:56.853
Do not presume to tell me how
to handle my prisoners, Captain.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.857
You don't know lko like l do.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.189
He killed a young
father for no reason.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.388
Before that, he committed
dozens of violent crimes.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.899
He's spent his entire
life hurting people.

11:08.067 --> 11:10.763
That doesn't excuse
what you did to him.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.235
Until your transport vessel
gets here,

11:14.306 --> 11:16.900
you and your men won't be
allowed in the cargo bay.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.943
You're in charge
of the prisoners.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.569
Aye, Captain.

11:20.646 --> 11:22.204
They're my responsibility.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.908
Not as long
as you're aboard my ship.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.416
l won't risk any more violence.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.452
The only risk will
be to your crew.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.283
Commander Tuvok
isn't qualified

11:29.355 --> 11:31.289
to guard prisoners
this dangerous.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.848
Tuvok has been
a Starfleet Security Officer

11:33.926 --> 11:35.154
for a very long time.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.718
Believe me, he's qualified.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.231
l hope you're right.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.939
You remember Mr. lko.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.678
Vividly.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.846
The Nygeans decided to
make an example of him.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.354
Did you call me here

12:04.390 --> 12:07.120
to make a point
about Nygean barbarity?

12:07.193 --> 12:08.125
l called you here

12:08.194 --> 12:10.458
because l need your
help to save his life.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.832
He sustained a severe
blow to the head,

12:17.937 --> 12:19.404
which has caused severe edema

12:19.472 --> 12:20.496
in his parietal lobe.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.574
lt's blocking vital
neurotransmitters.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.075
l'd like to program
some of your nanoprobes

12:25.144 --> 12:26.270
to bypass the edema.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.215
l'll comply.

12:31.283 --> 12:34.218
l sense a ''but'' coming.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.117
lt seems inefficient
to save the life

12:36.188 --> 12:38.122
of someone
who's about to be executed.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.124
lf the Nygeans insist
on killing him,

12:40.192 --> 12:41.955
there isn't much
l can do about it,

12:42.061 --> 12:44.154
but l won't let them
do it on Voyager.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.698
l didn't expect to
see you back so soon.

12:53.506 --> 12:57.135
Ordinarily, we're lucky
to get one meal a day.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.541
That's terrible.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.479
Yediq likes to keep us hungry.

13:04.150 --> 13:07.381
Less talk. We're hungry!

13:07.453 --> 13:09.387
You're wondering why l'm here.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.616
Excuse me?

13:11.690 --> 13:15.456
You're wondering what l did
to end up with men like them.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.090
You killed someone?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.727
That's right.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.669
Why?

13:30.743 --> 13:32.506
Because l'm Benkaran.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.342
What does that have
to do with it?

13:39.585 --> 13:41.610
lt's common knowledge

13:41.687 --> 13:43.951
that all Benkarans
are criminals,

13:44.023 --> 13:47.356
so when l was found
in the vicinity of a murder,

13:47.426 --> 13:49.360
l was immediately arrested.

13:49.428 --> 13:53.057
Are you saying you didn't do it?

13:53.132 --> 13:57.432
l told you, l'm Benkaran.

13:57.536 --> 14:01.267
What l say doesn't matter.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.988
You suffered
severe neurological trauma,

14:18.057 --> 14:20.617
but l believe
we've repaired the damage.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.389
Thank you.

14:25.464 --> 14:28.297
Don't thank me.
Thank Seven of Nine.

14:28.367 --> 14:32.235
She donated the nanoprobes
that saved your life.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.239
Oh, my head.

14:35.307 --> 14:36.274
The pain is normal.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.866
l'll prepare an analgesic.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.713
You're not afraid of me.

14:45.784 --> 14:49.550
There's no reason to fear
someone in your condition.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.783
You were never afraid of me,

14:51.857 --> 14:55.520
not even when l
tried to kill you.

14:55.594 --> 14:58.427
lt's nice to look
into someone's eyes

14:58.497 --> 15:01.557
and not see fear.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.170
Do you have to be
a criminal to get

15:11.243 --> 15:12.767
something to eat
around here?

15:12.845 --> 15:16.008
Sorry. Dinner will be
ready in 15 minutes.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.606
You said that
15 minutes ago.

15:18.684 --> 15:21.778
Did you know the Nygeans
govern a sector of space

15:21.854 --> 15:24.846
occupied by several
different humanoid species?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.892
lf we say yes,
will you feed us?

15:26.992 --> 15:30.018
One of those species
is the Benkarans.

15:30.095 --> 15:35.260
They occupy just ten
percent of Nygean space,

15:35.334 --> 15:39.703
but take up nearly 80 percent
of the space in Nygean prisons.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.208
Maybe they commit
more crimes.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.800
Not according to Joleg,
one of the prisoners.

15:45.911 --> 15:47.674
You think he was given
a harsher sentence

15:47.746 --> 15:49.270
because of his species?

15:49.348 --> 15:50.542
According to this,

15:50.616 --> 15:52.584
Benkarans are ten times
more likely

15:52.651 --> 15:55.279
to be executed for their crimes
than Nygeans.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.378
Where'd you get that?

15:56.455 --> 15:58.082
l contacted the
Nygean government.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.419
Told them l was interested

15:59.491 --> 16:00.549
in a cultural exchange.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.854
Among other things,
they let me access data

16:02.962 --> 16:05.055
on their criminal
justice system.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.463
lt all supports
what Joleg told me.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.764
Neelix...

16:10.869 --> 16:12.097
l know what you're thinking.

16:12.204 --> 16:13.432
That you're the softest touch

16:13.539 --> 16:14.870
in the Delta Quadrant.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.102
These are the transcripts
from Joleg's trial.

16:18.177 --> 16:21.271
He was convicted
on circumstantial evidence.

16:21.347 --> 16:24.077
Let me guess. He was in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.741
Apparently.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.753
Neelix, when l was
in the Federation penal colony,

16:28.821 --> 16:30.118
everybody had a story.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.522
l never put much stock in them.
Neither should you.

16:33.592 --> 16:37.460
How many of those people
were sentenced to die?

16:45.037 --> 16:46.732
l still don't understand.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.273
Why weren't you hurt?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.104
Because my matrix is photonic.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.576
l'm made of light.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.806
You wanted to see me?

16:55.881 --> 16:57.314
l'll be with you
in just a moment.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.544
You don't feel pain?

16:59.618 --> 17:04.419
Well, l suppose my pride
has been wounded on occasion.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.116
l wish l was made of light.

17:10.295 --> 17:11.557
Try to rest.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.329
Mr. lko responded so well to
the first dose of nanoprobes,

17:16.435 --> 17:19.029
l thought a second might
improve his condition further.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.402
lt'll only take a
moment to extract them.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.876
You and Mr. lko seem to
be getting along well.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.504
lt's the strangest thing.

17:30.582 --> 17:33.517
When he first arrived,
he was crude, abusive.

17:33.585 --> 17:36.850
Now he's a model patient--
grateful, considerate.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.890
He's obviously an
unstable individual.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.323
lnconsistent behavior
is hardly surprising.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.884
Still, if it weren't
for the security detail

17:43.996 --> 17:45.623
l'd forget he
was a criminal.

17:45.697 --> 17:48.791
lt's possible he's trying
to manipulate you.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.528
Doctor!

17:56.075 --> 17:57.235
What's the matter?

17:57.309 --> 17:58.708
My stomach.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.172
l'm not detecting
anything.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.375
l... l can't...

18:05.451 --> 18:07.078
What's wrong?

18:07.152 --> 18:10.610
l... l can't stop
thinking about...

18:10.689 --> 18:12.316
the man l killed.

18:12.391 --> 18:13.619
That's not surprising.

18:13.692 --> 18:15.353
You're experiencing guilt.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.055
ls that why l'm feeling sick?

18:18.130 --> 18:21.031
Nausea could be
a symptom of guilt.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.261
l've never felt guilty before.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.393
You've committed many crimes.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.904
None of them
made me feel like this.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.307
Why did you do this to me?

18:32.377 --> 18:34.868
We're not responsible
for your guilt.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.710
l didn't feel this way,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.809
until you put
those nanoprobes in me.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.047
You knew this would happen,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.589
didn't you?

18:44.656 --> 18:46.886
This is some kind

18:47.025 --> 18:48.856
of punishment.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.492
Take the nanoprobes out.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.828
You could die.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.161
Please?

18:59.271 --> 19:03.674
l don't want to feel
this way anymore.

19:12.851 --> 19:14.182
You don't honestly believe

19:14.253 --> 19:16.153
we're responsible
for his condition.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.813
We applied the
Borg technology.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.185
lt's possible there were

19:19.258 --> 19:20.816
some unforeseen side effects.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.554
Guilt, for example.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.593
Look at this.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.099
What?

19:29.201 --> 19:30.600
lt's my most recent scan.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.829
The neurotransmitters
have established

19:33.005 --> 19:35.371
new pathways
throughout his cortex.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.408
Wasn't that your intention?

19:37.476 --> 19:39.171
No, l was simply trying

19:39.244 --> 19:40.734
to bypass the edema.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.677
Then how did this happen?

19:42.748 --> 19:44.010
l don't know.

19:44.082 --> 19:46.846
lt's possible this is normal
Nygean brain activity,

19:46.919 --> 19:49.479
but l have no basis
for comparison.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.318
You should ask Mr. Yediq

19:51.390 --> 19:53.881
to contact
a Nygean medical official.

19:53.959 --> 19:57.520
Maybe they could provide
some relevant information.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.999
Seven of Nine.

20:06.104 --> 20:07.571
Stay?

20:07.639 --> 20:09.038
Talk to me.

20:09.107 --> 20:10.699
l'm extremely busy.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.039
Please.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.703
l'm scared.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.086
What did you want to discuss?

20:25.691 --> 20:28.717
l'm due in Astrometrics,
so if there's nothing...

20:28.794 --> 20:30.625
Astrometrics-- what's that?

20:30.696 --> 20:33.859
A laboratory where
we observe stellar phenomena.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.560
When l was a child,

20:36.668 --> 20:40.604
l'd... lie under the stars
for hours.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.904
l'd stare at them
until l could see the shapes.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.604
Shapes?

20:46.678 --> 20:50.808
Faces and animals
made out of stars.

20:50.882 --> 20:54.113
You're referring
to constellations.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.780
l named them.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.289
There was
Paedos the Warrior

20:59.358 --> 21:05.160
and Gezid the Beast.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.698
No matter how hard he tried,

21:07.733 --> 21:11.225
Paedos could never catch Gezid.

21:11.336 --> 21:14.772
Because the distance between
them always remained the same.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.866
You've seen them?

21:17.976 --> 21:20.035
Possibly.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.172
l've cataloged approximately
six billion stars.

21:23.248 --> 21:28.311
Then you must have seen Onella,
too-- the Mother.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.556
Describe her.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.115
She was surrounded

21:35.193 --> 21:38.253
by 16 smaller stars--

21:38.330 --> 21:40.264
her daughters.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.129
lf l try, l think

21:42.200 --> 21:45.499
l can remember
all their names.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.210
Grid 1 1-6. Green.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.744
What's going on over there?

21:53.812 --> 21:54.904
Kot-Kot.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.976
That's Kadis-Kot.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.574
Congratulations.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.176
Down here.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.648
l've been doing some research

22:05.724 --> 22:07.658
on the Nygean legal system.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.159
You were right

22:09.227 --> 22:12.492
about the Benkarans
receiving harsher sentences.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.498
l saw the statistics.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.535
Statistics won't save me.

22:17.602 --> 22:21.038
l noticed some people
convicted of murder--

22:21.139 --> 22:25.041
even terrible, premeditated
murders-- weren't executed.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.135
Some weren't punished at all,

22:27.212 --> 22:28.941
but you were
sentenced to death.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.708
That's what the family wants.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.545
The family?

22:32.617 --> 22:34.551
After you're convicted,

22:34.619 --> 22:37.349
the family of the
victim sentences you.

22:37.422 --> 22:41.085
Well, shouldn't you be sentenced
by someone less partial,

22:41.159 --> 22:42.888
like a judge?

22:42.961 --> 22:46.055
Vekto valek k'vadim.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.065
lt's Ancient Nygean.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.101
lt means, ''Favor the victims.''

22:52.204 --> 22:56.368
What if l stole your game board?

22:56.441 --> 23:00.468
What right would a judge have
to assign value to your loss?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.479
To him, it's just a game board,

23:02.547 --> 23:05.880
but to you it might be
a priceless family possession.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.084
And what
if l murdered your child?

23:13.425 --> 23:15.655
l think l get your point.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.321
Vekto valek k'vadim.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.525
lt's the basis for the
Nygean legal system.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.033
What about the criminals

23:23.135 --> 23:25.103
that didn't serve
any sentence at all?

23:25.170 --> 23:29.937
Some people prefer
restitution to revenge.

23:30.041 --> 23:33.238
lf a defendant is
wealthy enough,

23:33.311 --> 23:36.109
he can negotiate a settlement
with the victim's family.

23:36.181 --> 23:39.275
Oh, that doesn't seem fair.

23:39.351 --> 23:43.287
lt's perfectly fair,
unless you're destitute.

23:46.124 --> 23:48.615
Maybe l can talk to the Captain

23:48.693 --> 23:52.493
about finding a way
to compensate your victims.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.964
l'm grateful...

23:55.066 --> 23:57.864
but it would imply l'm guilty.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.731
l wouldn't want that.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.305
There must
be something l can do.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.077
You can transmit a letter
to my brother.

24:10.148 --> 24:13.640
l'd like to let him know
what's happened to me.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.845
l'll get a padd.

24:30.101 --> 24:33.070
l thought you might
find this interesting.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.042
What is it?

24:39.110 --> 24:40.873
lt's an Astrometrics log.

24:40.946 --> 24:42.470
lt contains data

24:42.547 --> 24:44.811
on various star formations.

24:46.885 --> 24:49.513
lt's just words and numbers.

24:49.588 --> 24:52.318
l'd rather look at the stars.

24:52.390 --> 24:55.826
l'll bring you a star chart

24:55.894 --> 24:57.657
after my next shift.

25:05.203 --> 25:07.262
What's the metal above your eye?

25:07.372 --> 25:10.307
lt's a cybernetic implant.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.842
Where did you get it?

25:11.910 --> 25:14.140
lt was installed by the Borg.

25:14.212 --> 25:16.146
Must have hurt.

25:16.214 --> 25:19.274
l don't recall.

25:22.053 --> 25:24.521
l hurt people.

25:26.892 --> 25:29.554
l deserve to die.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.488
Seven?

25:32.564 --> 25:34.862
l found something.

25:45.343 --> 25:48.506
This is a scan depicting
a healthy Nygean brain.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.174
This node is analogous

25:51.249 --> 25:52.546
to the human pineal gland.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.949
ln addition to controlling
behavioral impulses,

25:55.053 --> 25:56.543
it regulates decision making.

25:56.621 --> 25:57.883
You might say

25:57.956 --> 25:59.947
it's the physiological
equivalent of a conscience.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.653
Normally, the node connects
to the rest of the brain

26:02.694 --> 26:04.525
through a series
of neural pathways.

26:04.596 --> 26:05.824
Now...

26:05.931 --> 26:07.660
look at the scan of lko's node

26:07.732 --> 26:09.632
before we applied
the nanoprobes.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.258
lt's detached.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.303
Did that happen
when he was assaulted?

26:13.371 --> 26:15.931
No. l believe it's
congenital-- a birth defect.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.169
Without the node, lko would
have been prone to violence

26:19.244 --> 26:21.144
and sociopathic
behavior all his life.

26:21.212 --> 26:22.645
When l used
Seven's nanoprobes

26:22.714 --> 26:24.511
to treat the injuries
from the assault,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.518
it seems they inadvertently
repaired the defect, as well.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.315
You've activated his conscience.

26:29.387 --> 26:30.820
Well, that would explain

26:30.889 --> 26:32.720
why he's suddenly
experiencing guilt.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.224
There's more to it than that.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.886
l believe he's become capable
of controlling

26:36.962 --> 26:38.486
his violent impulses.

26:38.563 --> 26:40.554
Capable, maybe,

26:40.632 --> 26:42.190
but how do you know he will?

26:42.267 --> 26:45.031
Even the thought of violence
makes him ill now.

26:45.136 --> 26:48.071
ln my opinion, he's no longer
a threat to anyone.

26:48.139 --> 26:50.334
By some definitions, Captain,

26:50.408 --> 26:53.002
he's not the same man
who committed the murder.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.245
Are you suggesting
we release him?

27:03.321 --> 27:05.346
Of course not,
but at the very least,

27:05.423 --> 27:07.152
his case should
be reexamined.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.715
Because he's sorry.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.954
There's new medical
evidence to be considered.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.930
None of it changes the fact
that he killed a man.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.830
He was suffering
from a neurological defect.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.332
He couldn't control
his behavior.

27:17.435 --> 27:19.164
lf lko had been diagnosed
and treated,

27:19.270 --> 27:21.261
he never would have committed
that crime.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.670
ln a manner of speaking,

27:22.741 --> 27:24.402
he's a victim
of his own biology.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.171
So lko is the victim now?

27:26.244 --> 27:27.871
No one's denying

27:28.013 --> 27:31.176
that he committed
a terrible crime,

27:31.249 --> 27:33.774
but as a result
of the Doctor's treatments,

27:33.852 --> 27:36.013
he's undergone
a fundamental change.

27:36.087 --> 27:38.385
Killing him
won't accomplish anything.

27:38.456 --> 27:40.287
That's not your decision
to make.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.689
Nor is it yours.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.990
He's obviously
deceiving you somehow.

27:44.062 --> 27:46.292
Listen, we could debate this
all day,

27:46.364 --> 27:49.822
but the fact is, our personal
opinions are irrelevant.

27:49.901 --> 27:51.892
All that matters is Nygean law.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.461
Does lko have a legal means
of appeal at his disposal?

27:55.573 --> 27:59.304
ln accordance
with Nygean Penal Code,

27:59.377 --> 28:02.778
a capital defendant has a right
to appeal his sentence

28:02.881 --> 28:04.746
to the family of his victims.

28:04.783 --> 28:06.808
Then l'd like you
to help Commander Tuvok

28:06.951 --> 28:08.646
draft an appeal

28:08.720 --> 28:10.483
and submit it
to the proper authorities.

28:16.161 --> 28:18.095
Take back the appeal.

28:18.163 --> 28:19.460
You'd rather die,

28:19.531 --> 28:21.658
because you think
it'll relieve your pain?

28:23.735 --> 28:26.761
Death is what l deserve.

28:26.871 --> 28:28.395
You say l've changed,

28:28.506 --> 28:31.134
but l look at these hands
every day,

28:31.209 --> 28:34.542
and l see them squeezing
that man's throat,

28:34.612 --> 28:37.979
and l hear the
sounds he made.

28:41.286 --> 28:43.481
l'm disgusting.

28:46.091 --> 28:48.753
Do you think l'm disgusting?

28:50.295 --> 28:54.026
You've been nothing
but kind to me.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.727
You asked me earlier
if it hurt

28:56.835 --> 28:59.804
when my occipital implant
was installed.

28:59.904 --> 29:03.772
l told you l didn't remember,

29:03.875 --> 29:06.469
but the truth is...

29:06.511 --> 29:10.072
it was one of the most painful
experiences of my life.

29:10.148 --> 29:13.208
Why did you lie?

29:16.821 --> 29:21.258
lt's difficult for me
to talk about,

29:21.326 --> 29:24.420
because l forced others
to undergo the same procedure.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.428
Why?

29:25.497 --> 29:26.794
l was compelled to do so

29:26.865 --> 29:28.594
by the Borg collective.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.134
l wasn't in control
of my actions,

29:31.202 --> 29:35.036
just as you weren't in control
when you took a life.

29:35.106 --> 29:39.372
My nanoprobes
have given you control.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.877
You're a different person now.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.606
You don't deserve
to be executed.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.752
l want to go back to my cell.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.522
You're free to remain here.

29:57.595 --> 29:59.119
Am l still sick?

29:59.197 --> 30:00.755
No, but...

30:00.832 --> 30:03.426
Then l don't want
special treatment.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.274
l'm glad to see
you're feeling better.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.980
You must be hungry.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.460
Here you go.

30:37.569 --> 30:38.695
Give it to him.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.768
He's already had his dinner.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.436
Please.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.545
All right.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.904
You wanted to see me.

31:13.972 --> 31:18.466
We just received a response
from the Nygeans.

31:18.576 --> 31:21.477
The family has refused
to consider the appeal.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.413
But the medical evidence...

31:24.482 --> 31:26.245
They won't look at it.

31:26.317 --> 31:28.444
The family
found the request insulting.

31:28.519 --> 31:30.612
Your government could insist
that they review it.

31:30.688 --> 31:35.091
We have laws that protect
victims from emotional distress.

31:35.159 --> 31:38.287
ln that case, we should grant
lko asylum aboard Voyager.

31:38.363 --> 31:40.228
You agreed to work

31:40.298 --> 31:42.289
within the confines
of our legal system.

31:42.367 --> 31:43.959
Your system is flawed.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.296
That's enough, Seven.

31:46.771 --> 31:52.300
l assure you, we'll abide
by the family's decision.

31:52.377 --> 31:56.211
Now, l need a moment alone
with Seven, if you don't mind?

32:01.719 --> 32:03.687
We did everything we could
to help him.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.416
We have to do more.

32:05.490 --> 32:06.821
You barely know this man.

32:06.891 --> 32:09.257
Why are you so passionate
about helping him?

32:09.327 --> 32:12.387
l want to give him the same
opportunity you gave me.

32:12.463 --> 32:16.229
When you severed my
link to the collective,

32:16.334 --> 32:17.801
you changed who l was.

32:17.902 --> 32:21.429
You made it possible for me
to reclaim my humanity.

32:21.539 --> 32:25.407
Because of my nanoprobes, lko
has undergone a similar change.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.877
He should be given the chance
to atone for his crimes.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.508
Atonement?
ls that what this is about?

32:32.583 --> 32:33.811
Yes.

32:33.885 --> 32:37.048
For him... or for you?

32:37.121 --> 32:39.851
l don't know what you mean.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.620
l think part of you
still feels responsible

32:42.694 --> 32:46.289
for the violent acts you
committed when you were a Borg.

32:46.364 --> 32:47.524
You're mistaken.

32:47.598 --> 32:49.964
Am l?

32:50.134 --> 32:54.537
Maybe you believe
if lko is found not guilty,

32:54.605 --> 32:56.402
somehow you won't
be guilty, either.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.238
You said it yourself.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.777
You've reclaimed your humanity.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.903
lt's time you stopped
blaming yourself

33:02.947 --> 33:04.676
for the crimes
of the collective.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.284
Report.

33:13.358 --> 33:16.088
An alien vessel just dropped
out of warp and opened fire.

33:39.050 --> 33:43.043
We've lost power
on Decks 8 through 10.

33:43.121 --> 33:44.110
The cargo bay.

33:50.728 --> 33:52.355
Hurry, hurry!

33:52.430 --> 33:54.398
Follow me.
Let's go to the Bridge.

33:54.465 --> 33:55.432
Keep 'em down!

34:00.872 --> 34:01.930
Hurry.

34:04.275 --> 34:06.641
There's a corridor...

34:06.711 --> 34:07.837
Stay together.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.659
Shields down to 60 percent.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.355
Still no response to hails.

34:25.429 --> 34:26.590
Evasive maneuvers.

34:26.664 --> 34:27.995
Target their weapons.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.609
Tuvok to Bridge.
The attacking ship

34:43.681 --> 34:45.911
is attempting to transport
one of the prisoners.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.781
They're trying to lock on to all
five Benkaran life signs.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.784
Target their transporter array.

34:57.895 --> 34:58.827
Direct hit.

34:58.896 --> 35:00.295
They're retreating.

35:00.398 --> 35:01.831
Pursuit course?

35:01.866 --> 35:03.060
No, we have
more immediate problems.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.429
Bridge to Tuvok.
What's your status?

35:05.736 --> 35:07.966
We've neutralized
two of the prisoners.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.401
Someone's trying to get
into the Shuttle Bay.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.671
Lock them out.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.775
Again.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.215
Stand back!

35:24.522 --> 35:26.649
Don't move.

35:34.632 --> 35:38.159
You have five minutes
to get us a shuttle.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.063
Tuvok to Bridge.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.197
Lock on to Yediq's
signature, and beam him to...

35:43.307 --> 35:44.638
Transporters are off-line.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.678
We need at least ten minutes
to get them up and running.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.780
Seal it.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.823
You're not getting off

36:01.893 --> 36:03.019
this ship.

36:03.094 --> 36:05.688
Then l suppose l should kill you
right now.

36:08.466 --> 36:09.592
Don't!

36:16.507 --> 36:17.838
He's mine.

36:25.583 --> 36:27.949
You saw how they beat me.

36:39.163 --> 36:41.131
l knew it was a trick.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.633
l knew you hadn't changed.

37:09.994 --> 37:12.224
Captain's Log, supplemental.

37:12.296 --> 37:14.560
Warden Yediq has used
his influence

37:14.632 --> 37:16.532
to convince the Nygean family

37:16.601 --> 37:19.570
to hear lko's appeal
for leniency.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.599
l won't beg for my life.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.335
lt belongs to you.

37:25.409 --> 37:32.110
l only want you to understand
what's happened to me.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.084
l'm a different person now...

37:35.152 --> 37:37.882
a better person.

37:37.989 --> 37:44.792
This crew...
has helped me to see that.

37:56.974 --> 37:59.875
lf my death
helps you find peace,

37:59.944 --> 38:02.674
l can accept it.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.771
But if you let me live,

38:04.815 --> 38:09.980
l will never hurt anyone again.

38:12.857 --> 38:16.520
Whatever you decide,

38:16.594 --> 38:21.657
please know how sorry l am

38:21.732 --> 38:24.997
for what l took from you.

38:29.907 --> 38:31.807
Are we playing
Kadis-Kot later?

38:31.876 --> 38:33.503
Sorry.

38:33.577 --> 38:36.239
Afraid l'll beat you again?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.339
l tried to help you,

38:38.416 --> 38:40.384
and you took advantage of me.

38:40.451 --> 38:42.612
What do you mean?

38:42.687 --> 38:44.882
The note we sent your brother.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.549
He traced the transmission
to Voyager.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.525
He's the one who attacked us.

38:49.593 --> 38:53.552
Neelix, l swear l had no idea

38:53.631 --> 38:55.622
he would do that.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.133
You have to believe me.

38:57.234 --> 38:59.998
l read Yediq's security report.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.663
You threatened to kill him.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.669
l can't eat this.

39:07.745 --> 39:09.076
Why not?

39:09.146 --> 39:11.273
l'm sick.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.579
You look fine to me.

39:13.651 --> 39:17.815
No, l must have
the same condition lko had.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.522
lf your Doctor cures me,

39:23.594 --> 39:25.892
l can make an appeal
for my life, too.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.506
She's beautiful, isn't she?

39:39.577 --> 39:42.239
Onella, the Mother?

39:46.217 --> 39:49.084
And there's Paedos...

39:49.153 --> 39:51.121
still watching over her.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.319
lt was kind of
Captain Janeway

39:57.395 --> 39:59.158
to let you bring me here.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.458
lf your appeal is successful,

40:00.531 --> 40:02.260
you'll be able to go
wherever you want.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.824
l hope you're right.

40:04.935 --> 40:06.960
lf l am, where will you go?

40:10.274 --> 40:11.832
l don't know.

40:11.942 --> 40:13.034
lf you'd like,

40:13.110 --> 40:14.338
l could ask Captain Janeway

40:14.412 --> 40:16.471
to consider
letting you stay here.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.310
l'm not a scientist.

40:18.382 --> 40:22.079
l don't think
l'd be much help to anyone.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.917
There are other ways
to be useful.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.547
l'm sure we could think
of something.

40:26.624 --> 40:29.821
l'd like that.

40:37.401 --> 40:39.392
l'm sorry.

40:39.503 --> 40:43.530
The family has denied
your appeal.

40:43.641 --> 40:45.404
We're due to rendezvous

40:45.476 --> 40:48.411
with a transport
ship in a few hours.

40:48.479 --> 40:52.415
l need to return
you to your cell.

41:02.026 --> 41:04.494
You were the first person

41:04.562 --> 41:06.792
who wasn't afraid
to look me in the eye.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.192
That's how l'd like
to remember you.

41:51.208 --> 41:54.006
l just finished looking over
your warp core analysis.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.009
And?

41:55.112 --> 41:56.238
l'm impressed.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.406
lt usually takes a few days
to finish one of these.

41:58.482 --> 42:00.245
B'Elanna tells me
you did it in 22 hours.

42:00.351 --> 42:04.151
l haven't felt the need
to regenerate.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.954
Everyone grieves
in their own way.

42:12.930 --> 42:13.897
lf you want to talk,

42:14.031 --> 42:15.999
you know where to find me.

42:18.068 --> 42:19.831
lt's unfair.

42:19.937 --> 42:22.838
l think so, too, Seven...

42:22.907 --> 42:26.172
but we have to try not
to judge their system.

42:26.243 --> 42:29.576
That's not what l meant.

42:29.647 --> 42:33.208
lko was executed
for taking a single life.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.412
As a drone,
l took thousands,

42:36.487 --> 42:39.479
but l was never punished.

42:45.262 --> 42:50.131
You lost 20 years of
your life to the Borg.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.964
l'd say that's
punishment enough.
