00:01.085 --> 00:03.495
<i>It's not the CIA
that's supplying the arms,</i>

00:03.515 --> 00:05.495
- it's a corporation.
- <i>This is about</i>

00:05.515 --> 00:06.575
the wars we're gonna be fighting

00:06.595 --> 00:07.695
in ten, 20 years' time.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.575
Do you have any idea
how much that's worth?

00:10.595 --> 00:12.605
<i>So we find a link
between KMPH and Al Moctar.</i>

00:12.625 --> 00:13.695
<i>A lot of deals...</i>

00:14.475 --> 00:16.605
A lot of bribes.
And they all seem to have

00:16.625 --> 00:19.525
one common denominator: you.

00:19.545 --> 00:20.575
I'd say you want her,
you got her.

00:20.595 --> 00:22.545
Senator Sullivan
just threatened my wife!

00:22.565 --> 00:25.545
- Pretty low, coming after my family!
- Says the woman

00:25.565 --> 00:27.575
threatening to
send my wife to jail.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.665
Who paid your ransom?
I want names! Details!

00:29.685 --> 00:31.625
Everything you have
on the Deep State.

00:31.645 --> 00:33.655
- I went to Hal Weaver.
- You did what?

00:33.675 --> 00:34.655
<i>He cut a deal with Kingsley...</i>

00:34.675 --> 00:36.585
They're offering the same thing
to you, Amanda.

00:36.605 --> 00:38.515
<i>You'd be done at the Agency.</i>

00:38.535 --> 00:39.545
Brandon?

00:41.685 --> 00:44.555
I want the order to come
from <i>you,</i> Nate.

00:44.575 --> 00:46.475
Amanda Jones...

00:46.495 --> 00:47.545
<i>Consider it done.</i>

00:47.565 --> 00:49.665
<i>There is no Deep
State, Senator.</i>

00:49.685 --> 00:51.665
<i>Just a bunch of old white guys
clinging to power.</i>

00:51.685 --> 00:53.695
<i>Doing everything they can
to protect their interests</i>

00:54.475 --> 00:56.485
<i>before they become extinct.</i>

00:57.675 --> 00:59.665
Okay, pick it up.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.475
Pull the big one!

01:01.495 --> 01:02.555
That was amazing.

01:02.575 --> 01:04.545
You're in goal now.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.595
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Come on, go!

01:05.615 --> 01:06.595
- Oh!
- Yay!

01:06.615 --> 01:09.505
- That was pretty good.
- Oh, Daddy...

01:17.575 --> 01:19.535
Yeah... hello?

01:19.555 --> 01:22.535
- <i>So they have him.</i>
- Who?

01:22.555 --> 01:23.625
Harry Clarke.

01:23.645 --> 01:26.555
Our military picked him up
in Bamako.

01:26.575 --> 01:30.625
Why do I get the distinct
feeling this is news to you?

01:30.645 --> 01:34.635
- Um... uh, no, uh...
- <i>Get over here.</i>

01:40.485 --> 01:42.475
<i>This is Brandon Napier.</i>

01:42.495 --> 01:43.705
<i>Please leave a message.
I'll get back to you.</i>

01:44.485 --> 01:45.585
Brandon, it's Nate.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.505
You want to tell me
what the fuck is going on?

01:56.505 --> 01:58.475
<i>This is Amanda Jones.

Come here.

02:27.705 --> 02:30.485
I'm so sorry!

02:30.505 --> 02:33.575
It's okay.

02:33.595 --> 02:34.645
I love...

02:46.635 --> 02:48.575
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

02:48.595 --> 02:51.575
It's 4:00 in the morning,
what do <i>you</i> think?

02:59.565 --> 03:01.615
<i>We're coming to you
live from Washington,</i>

03:01.635 --> 03:05.615
<i>where federal prosecutor
Aaron Roth was killed tonight.</i>

03:05.635 --> 03:07.685
<i>Sources within the police department are saying</i>

03:07.705 --> 03:09.685
<i>it was a mugging
gone horribly wrong.</i>

03:09.705 --> 03:13.665
<i>...around 10:00 p.m. last night.</i>

03:13.685 --> 03:15.695
<i>Meaghan?</i>

03:16.475 --> 03:18.615
<i>Meaghan, are you there?</i>

03:35.525 --> 03:37.585
<i>This is Amanda Jones.
Please leave me a message.</i>

03:51.645 --> 03:54.485
Thank you.

03:54.505 --> 03:56.625
Why are you thanking <i>her?</i>

03:56.645 --> 03:58.675
You should be thanking <i>me.</i>

03:58.695 --> 04:00.655
Still breathing, aren't you?

04:03.555 --> 04:06.665
Tell me you know where
they've taken Harry Clarke.

04:06.685 --> 04:08.665
I don't.

04:08.685 --> 04:11.515
What about Napier?

04:11.535 --> 04:14.505
- I can't get ahold of him.
- Do you think,

04:14.525 --> 04:15.625
at this crucial moment,
he's decided

04:15.645 --> 04:18.475
to make himself unavailable?

04:18.495 --> 04:20.475
No, sir.

04:20.495 --> 04:23.545
No. Then his silence

04:23.565 --> 04:25.485
does not bode well for us,
does it, Nate?

04:25.505 --> 04:27.515
- No, it does not.
- No.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.555
And what about Jones?

04:29.575 --> 04:31.675
Let me take a wild guess here.

04:31.695 --> 04:36.595
You have no idea
where she is.

04:36.615 --> 04:37.625
I do not.

04:40.575 --> 04:43.635
Well, ain't this
just a fucking day?

04:43.655 --> 04:46.515
Now you understand one thing
here, Nathan.

04:46.535 --> 04:49.595
You're not dealing
with Kingsley anymore.

04:49.615 --> 04:52.485
I don't have his...
how shall I put it?

04:52.505 --> 04:54.695
...restraint.
You don't fix this,

04:55.475 --> 04:56.495
I'm gonna take this fork,

04:56.515 --> 04:57.525
and I'm gonna stick it

04:57.545 --> 05:00.525
in your fucking eyeballs myself.

05:03.705 --> 05:05.665
Pass the salt.

05:15.665 --> 05:17.605
Now fuck off.

Leyla?

07:19.575 --> 07:21.495
Are you okay?
What happened?

07:21.515 --> 07:22.635
I'd kill for some water.

07:27.485 --> 07:29.645
Thank you.

07:34.535 --> 07:38.485
- Where's Harry?
- They have him.

07:41.665 --> 07:44.605
I'm so sorry.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.655
There were soldiers everywhere.

07:48.615 --> 07:50.635
I took a different turn.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.645
I shouldn't have left him.

08:03.665 --> 08:05.665
Do you know this man?

08:07.585 --> 08:10.525
It's Dan Lotz.
South African businessman.

08:10.545 --> 08:13.525
He's long been suspected
of dealing in illegal arms,

08:13.545 --> 08:15.545
but nothing's ever been proven.

08:16.685 --> 08:19.525
I think he's supplying
Al Moctar.

08:22.645 --> 08:24.695
We connect him to KMPH,

08:25.475 --> 08:26.685
we have a link.

08:29.505 --> 08:30.575
You sound like Harry.

08:34.554 --> 08:35.645
Wouldn't he love that?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.695
We find the link,

08:43.475 --> 08:44.575
we have leverage.

08:48.675 --> 08:50.695
Maybe we get him released.

08:57.475 --> 09:00.485
Gina?

09:00.505 --> 09:03.485
Sorry. Only me.

09:04.545 --> 09:05.635
Have you heard from her?

09:08.645 --> 09:10.485
No.

09:20.475 --> 09:22.615
His daughter's graduating
this year.

09:27.595 --> 09:28.675
It's okay.

09:33.695 --> 09:37.495
It's not okay, Jess.

09:37.515 --> 09:39.545
One thing it's fucking not,

09:39.565 --> 09:42.575
and that is okay.

09:42.595 --> 09:44.565
Hey.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.615
Hey, listen to me.
Okay?

09:48.635 --> 09:50.635
You're not gonna
let these fuckers win.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.595
You hear what I said?

09:58.535 --> 10:00.505
Now go get dressed.

10:18.565 --> 10:22.505
- Amanda.
- Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.

10:24.535 --> 10:25.695
Nathan Miller's office.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.475
Colonel Russell on the line.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.525
Colonel.

10:34.545 --> 10:35.675
<i>What's the latest
on Leyla Toumi?</i>

10:35.695 --> 10:37.565
We're still out there looking.

10:37.585 --> 10:39.565
Well, you may want to get eyes
on Aminata Sissoko.

10:39.585 --> 10:41.565
My bet is she's helping Toumi.

10:41.585 --> 10:42.645
Thank you, we'll do that.

10:42.665 --> 10:46.645
<i>Uh, did-did your boys
oversee Clarke's transport?</i>

10:46.665 --> 10:49.635
We escorted him to the airport.
That's it.

10:49.655 --> 10:52.485
<i>Well, I'm-I'm trying
to find the flight</i>

10:52.505 --> 10:53.665
manifest here.

10:53.685 --> 10:56.575
Uh, they-they took him to, um...

10:56.595 --> 10:57.615
<i>You better ask Amanda Jones</i>

10:57.635 --> 11:00.515
that one, because
she didn't tell me.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.485
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

11:03.505 --> 11:05.565
All right, I'll just...
I'll just do that.

11:05.585 --> 11:07.505
Thank you.

11:08.595 --> 11:11.525
Get me
Brigadier General Ramirez.

11:13.485 --> 11:17.555
Carlos.
How's Christine?

11:17.575 --> 11:20.655
Listen, I am, uh,
I am trying to track down

11:20.675 --> 11:23.645
a detainee by the name of, uh,

11:23.665 --> 11:25.505
of Harry Clarke.

11:25.525 --> 11:26.695
He was picked up
in Bamako, Mali last night

11:27.475 --> 11:29.535
by a platoon from 75th.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.575
Nothing. Huh.

11:32.595 --> 11:35.535
Of course, Eric. No,
I c... I-I totally understand.

11:35.555 --> 11:36.615
No, I appreciate it.

11:36.635 --> 11:37.695
Of course.
Yeah.

11:38.475 --> 11:40.695
Not a problem.
Bye-bye.

11:41.475 --> 11:42.705
I-I mean,
I've-I've asked-I've asked, uh,

11:43.485 --> 11:45.545
eight... eight fucking people
this question.

11:45.565 --> 11:47.625
If there is anything...
anything that you can find out

11:47.645 --> 11:50.635
for me, Cole, that would be
dinner on me at the Oak Room.

11:53.685 --> 11:56.705
Listen, I have to go.
I appreciate your time.

11:57.485 --> 12:00.645
- Is he in there?
- Ma'am, you can't just go in there.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.615
Karen Roth.

12:04.635 --> 12:06.605
Aaron Roth's daughter.

12:07.635 --> 12:10.515
It's okay, Sienna, I got this.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.535
When he asked me to be her
godmother, I said no.

12:15.555 --> 12:18.665
I was too busy. I thought
I'd be a terrible godmother.

12:18.685 --> 12:23.585
But he kept asking.

12:23.605 --> 12:25.545
That was Aaron.

12:28.685 --> 12:30.625
- Nothing if not persistent.
- Senator, I'm sorry

12:30.645 --> 12:33.515
for your loss, but this
has nothing to do with me.

12:36.545 --> 12:39.575
How do you lie so easily?

12:40.695 --> 12:44.485
Again, Senator,
I am very sorry for your loss,

12:44.505 --> 12:45.645
but this has nothing
to do with me.

12:53.495 --> 12:56.595
You're a fucking monster,
Mr. Miller.

12:59.535 --> 13:01.615
And I know you know it.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.485
I'm hungry.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.665
What are you hungry for?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.695
I don't know.

14:04.475 --> 14:05.705
You know what I'm hungry for?

14:06.485 --> 14:07.575
Beghrir.

14:07.595 --> 14:08.695
- You know what that is?
- No.

14:09.475 --> 14:10.595
They're little pancakes.

14:10.615 --> 14:12.625
My dad...

14:12.645 --> 14:15.545
used to make them for me
when I was little.

14:15.565 --> 14:17.655
I loved them so much.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.685
Dan Lotz's company records,
tax returns.

14:25.705 --> 14:28.545
Most of them aren't digitized,
I'm afraid.

14:31.475 --> 14:32.495
Okay...

14:32.515 --> 14:34.585
Okay, we're in for a long day.

14:34.605 --> 14:38.535
<i>So-so Harry Clarke
hasn't popped up on your radar?</i>

14:38.555 --> 14:40.695
Is there nothing that you can
give me, man? Nothing, Oliver?

14:41.475 --> 14:43.625
Come on, man.
A plane has to land.

14:43.645 --> 14:46.565
It doesn't just
fucking disappear.

14:48.485 --> 14:49.615
Okay.
All right, that's fine.

14:49.635 --> 14:51.585
No, I... I-I appreciate it.

14:51.605 --> 14:54.515
Thank you.
Thank you very... Thank you.

14:54.535 --> 14:56.695
Fuck! Fuck!

15:02.645 --> 15:05.585
- Nic?
- <i>Katie has a fever.</i>

15:05.605 --> 15:07.605
- They sent her home.
- <i>Is she okay?</i>

15:07.625 --> 15:09.475
Yeah, no,
I think she's gonna be fine.

15:09.495 --> 15:10.705
Thing is,
I have the board at 11:00.

15:11.485 --> 15:12.665
- Uh, did you try Maria?
- <i>No, I tried Maria,</i>

15:12.685 --> 15:15.545
<i>I tried Natasha, Kirsten...
I've tried everybody.</i>

15:15.565 --> 15:17.595
It's an hour.
Two, tops.

15:17.615 --> 15:20.635
Uh, Nic, I'm-I'm really
very sorry.

15:20.655 --> 15:23.675
I-I have a-a lot
going on today.

15:23.695 --> 15:26.475
Well, I thought you didn't want
to be a weekend dad.

15:26.495 --> 15:27.595
<i>I'm asking you to take care
of your daughter</i>

15:27.615 --> 15:28.655
<i>for a couple of hours.</i>

15:28.675 --> 15:31.685
Shouldn't be so hard.

15:33.705 --> 15:36.495
Okay.

16:07.545 --> 16:09.535
How was the flight?

16:09.555 --> 16:10.635
Comfortable?

16:10.655 --> 16:12.565
Long, right?

16:12.585 --> 16:14.525
Can we get you anything?

16:14.545 --> 16:16.605
Water? Soda?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.495
Coffee?

16:20.505 --> 16:22.485
Cigarette?

16:24.665 --> 16:27.655
I want to speak to Amanda Jones.

16:30.625 --> 16:33.635
- Hey.
- Hey. Is she okay?

16:33.655 --> 16:36.585
Yeah, she's sleeping.

16:36.605 --> 16:37.705
I'll see
if I can hurry them along.

16:39.655 --> 16:41.675
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

17:34.485 --> 17:36.575
Okay, we know

17:36.595 --> 17:39.555
Seracom paid
Miller's ransom,

17:39.575 --> 17:40.705
but we don't know why.

17:41.485 --> 17:42.595
Seracom bought the Mali
contracts from KMPH.

17:42.615 --> 17:45.605
But that's the only link
we have between them.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.605
Which gives us
absolutely nothing.

17:48.665 --> 17:50.605
I'm aware of that, thank you.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.555
Hi.

18:00.575 --> 18:02.495
I need some papers.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.555
Uh, Jess,
could you give us a moment?

18:04.575 --> 18:05.655
Yeah, of course.

18:10.675 --> 18:13.525
I'm not staying.

18:13.545 --> 18:15.595
No.

18:17.575 --> 18:19.695
I heard about Aaron.

18:21.615 --> 18:23.545
Sorry.

18:24.575 --> 18:26.605
I know that you two were close.

18:40.575 --> 18:42.605
Let me help.

18:58.645 --> 19:00.535
Was it you?

19:00.555 --> 19:02.565
Aaron's death?

19:02.585 --> 19:05.585
I know that you went to see him.

19:05.605 --> 19:07.615
Was it... was it this?

19:08.675 --> 19:11.525
I figured they'd come after me.

19:11.545 --> 19:13.525
Yeah, what wouldn't they do?

19:15.695 --> 19:18.605
But you still can't leave it
alone, can you? Even now.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.685
Especially now. I'm trying
to do the right thing, Gina.

19:20.705 --> 19:23.575
Yeah, and it blinds you
until you end up hurting

19:23.595 --> 19:25.495
everyone around you.

19:25.515 --> 19:28.575
- Everyone?
- Okay. Me.

19:32.555 --> 19:34.555
Shouldn't that be enough?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.505
Yeah.

19:50.525 --> 19:52.655
<i>Senator Sullivan,
this is Amanda Jones.</i>

20:22.475 --> 20:25.615
This whole "meeting
in parking structures..."

20:25.635 --> 20:28.505
it's in the CIA handbook, right?

20:28.525 --> 20:30.505
I like to control
my environment.

20:30.525 --> 20:31.695
And how's that
working out for you?

20:32.475 --> 20:34.545
- Meaning?
- Meaning you're clearly on the back foot

20:34.565 --> 20:36.625
or you wouldn't be
hiding down here.

20:36.645 --> 20:39.545
The interpreter
was the target...

20:39.565 --> 20:42.505
because she knew
who paid Miller's ransom.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.545
That's why you had her silenced.

20:47.475 --> 20:48.615
Am I warm?

20:48.635 --> 20:51.575
I'm not gonna answer
that question, Senator.

20:51.595 --> 20:53.635
- Then what the fuck am I doing here?
- Because I'm gonna

20:53.655 --> 20:55.535
give you someone who will.

20:58.535 --> 21:01.595
We know you were
involved in the attack on the bar.

21:01.615 --> 21:04.525
We know that you
were working with Al Moctar.

21:04.545 --> 21:07.675
Who did you report to?
Straight to Al Moctar?

21:07.695 --> 21:10.555
You and Toumi must have been
quite a catch for him.

21:10.575 --> 21:13.505
Two former
intelligence officers.

21:13.525 --> 21:17.595
You turned
on your own people, Harry.

21:17.615 --> 21:20.625
- Did you convert?
- Where is she?

21:20.645 --> 21:22.685
Where is Leyla Toumi?

21:22.705 --> 21:25.505
Amanda Jones.

21:25.525 --> 21:28.545
You can keep up with
this Amanda Jones shit all day.

21:28.565 --> 21:31.625
For the 14th fucking time,
she is not available.

21:31.645 --> 21:34.475
So either you talk to us, or...

21:34.495 --> 21:36.475
Amanda Jones.

21:39.555 --> 21:41.585
Okay.

22:03.485 --> 22:04.605
How's she doing?

22:04.625 --> 22:07.585
She's good.
She didn't wake up once.

22:07.605 --> 22:09.685
You're a lifesaver.

22:09.705 --> 22:12.525
How did it go?

22:12.545 --> 22:15.505
Oh, yeah. We got
our final slice of funding.

22:15.525 --> 22:17.575
Should see us through
the next six months.

22:17.595 --> 22:18.665
Congratulations.

22:20.665 --> 22:22.655
Yeah.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.485
Well, um...

22:33.595 --> 22:35.625
- Cole.
- <i>Hartwood.</i>

22:35.645 --> 22:38.535
That is un-fucking-believable
news, man.

22:38.555 --> 22:41.635
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:44.625 --> 22:46.645
I know where Clarke is.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.615
- Where is he?
- <i>He's at a black site</i>

22:49.635 --> 22:51.495
outside Hartwood.

22:51.515 --> 22:52.615
<i>Well, get inside
and pick him up.</i>

22:52.635 --> 22:54.505
It's an Agency site, sir.

22:54.525 --> 22:55.615
I can't just waltz in there.

22:55.635 --> 22:58.485
You've got contacts
inside Langley.

22:58.505 --> 23:01.525
I did.
Amanda Jones and Brandon Napier.

23:03.605 --> 23:05.695
Jones is running, but she won't
run without one thing.

23:06.475 --> 23:07.635
What's that?

23:07.655 --> 23:09.515
Her daughter.

23:21.565 --> 23:24.545
Get him up.

23:25.565 --> 23:26.625
Let's go, come on.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.595
I've asked you all the questions

23:56.615 --> 23:58.545
that I'm gonna ask you.

23:58.565 --> 24:02.645
You choose to answer them at any
point during this, I will stop.

24:02.665 --> 24:05.665
- Understood?
- Amanda Jones.

24:05.685 --> 24:07.605
Have it your way.

24:25.545 --> 24:28.695
"Enhanced interrogation,"
what a crock of shit.

24:29.475 --> 24:30.615
You're drowning, right?

24:30.635 --> 24:34.645
Answer our questions, Clarke,
and we will stop.

24:36.545 --> 24:37.605
Amanda Jones.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.515
Okay.

25:25.475 --> 25:27.575
Okay, everyone, time for cake.

25:35.665 --> 25:38.495
Mommy, Mommy!

25:39.555 --> 25:41.695
Oh, sweetie.

25:42.475 --> 25:43.615
Come on, we got to go.

25:43.635 --> 25:46.535
- But we haven't had cake yet.
- Okay.

25:46.555 --> 25:48.475
Amanda.

25:48.495 --> 25:49.665
What are you doing here?

25:49.685 --> 25:51.705
I had some downtime.

25:52.485 --> 25:53.705
I flew in this morning.

25:54.485 --> 25:55.515
Didn't think to call?

25:55.535 --> 25:57.545
It was last-minute.

25:57.565 --> 26:00.495
I thought I would take Evie out
for a bite to eat.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.545
Okay, well,
it's her sister's party.

26:02.565 --> 26:03.555
Half sister.

26:03.575 --> 26:04.675
Yeah.

26:04.695 --> 26:06.585
Forgot how petty you were.

26:06.605 --> 26:09.665
- Come on, we're going.
- No. She's not.

26:09.685 --> 26:12.585
She can go
when the party's over.

26:12.605 --> 26:13.665
You're welcome to stay.

26:13.685 --> 26:16.555
I do not have time for this.

26:17.675 --> 26:19.535
Shit.

26:20.555 --> 26:21.655
What is he doing here?

26:21.675 --> 26:23.625
I...

26:23.645 --> 26:26.605
I'm gonna need
a minute alone, please.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.505
Sweetie, you go with Daddy.

26:28.525 --> 26:29.685
I'll be a moment, okay?

26:32.495 --> 26:34.675
- Nate.
- Ed.

26:43.615 --> 26:45.475
Nice party.

26:46.645 --> 26:49.555
I can see
why you'd come back for it.

26:49.575 --> 26:52.485
- I was gonna tell you...
- I understand.

26:52.505 --> 26:54.535
Family first.

26:55.685 --> 26:57.575
Always.

27:04.575 --> 27:06.475
Shall we go?

27:08.585 --> 27:09.615
Where?

27:09.635 --> 27:11.645
Hartwood.

27:11.665 --> 27:14.565
You're going to get
Harry Clarke for me.

27:16.475 --> 27:18.565
I mean, that is...

27:18.585 --> 27:21.575
why you are here, isn't it?

27:22.635 --> 27:25.475
Of course.

27:25.495 --> 27:27.595
Unless you would like to...

27:27.615 --> 27:30.515
stay for cake?

27:30.535 --> 27:32.605
No. No, I'm good.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.575
Okay.
Then let's go.

27:35.595 --> 27:37.625
Can I say goodbye
to Evie first?

27:39.695 --> 27:43.485
Of course you can, Amanda.

28:08.595 --> 28:10.505
You want to take my car?

28:10.525 --> 28:12.665
No, that's okay.
We'll take mine.

28:12.685 --> 28:16.645
It's right up here.

28:46.615 --> 28:49.665
How's this gonna work for me
once the tape comes out?

28:51.685 --> 28:54.505
It's everything I promised.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.585
The deal will kick in.

28:56.605 --> 28:59.655
We'll take care of you, Amanda.
I made sure of that.

29:07.495 --> 29:08.625
I'll bring him out.

29:10.635 --> 29:13.625
Paperwork should
take about ten minutes.

29:22.685 --> 29:25.475
Hey, I'm here
to get Harry Clarke.

29:25.495 --> 29:27.575
ID. Fingers.

29:28.695 --> 29:31.475
You're clear.

30:09.655 --> 30:11.545
Get him down from there.

30:13.585 --> 30:15.545
Did you hear me?

30:15.565 --> 30:16.675
Get him down from there!

30:30.515 --> 30:32.655
That didn't come from me.

30:32.675 --> 30:35.675
The waterboarding...
I didn't order it.

30:35.695 --> 30:38.615
But you ordered me dead
in Tehran, right?

30:38.635 --> 30:41.525
Is that why you wanted to
see me... to dredge up the past?

30:42.545 --> 30:44.575
In Tehran, you were a threat.
I decided

30:44.595 --> 30:46.525
- to have you removed.
- But I'm still a threat,

30:46.545 --> 30:47.695
so why spare me now?

30:48.475 --> 30:50.545
Who said I was sparing you?

30:51.705 --> 30:54.585
Why didn't you
get on that plane in Mali?

30:54.605 --> 30:56.645
You were free.

30:58.515 --> 30:59.685
Yeah, well, maybe if I had
that moment again,

30:59.705 --> 31:01.575
I wouldn't play it the same way.

31:01.595 --> 31:03.555
Yes, you would.

31:03.575 --> 31:05.605
I heard you at Sissoko's house.

31:05.625 --> 31:07.645
You believe
in the power of truth.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.615
You're an idealist.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.655
- Am I?
- Haven't you heard?

31:11.675 --> 31:14.515
Truth isn't truth anymore.

31:14.535 --> 31:16.535
You can pick any version
of it you want.

31:16.555 --> 31:19.515
- Yeah, that's how you justify what you do.
- Yes, it is.

31:19.535 --> 31:21.525
That is how I live with myself.

31:21.545 --> 31:23.565
You're absolutely
fucking right about that.

31:27.685 --> 31:29.605
You didn't talk.

31:31.485 --> 31:32.695
You had your chance.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.635
You didn't talk about me,
about Kingsley, about any of it.

31:35.655 --> 31:37.535
Why?

31:37.555 --> 31:39.545
Leyla.

31:41.565 --> 31:42.665
She's still out there.

31:42.685 --> 31:45.585
You're gonna call off your dogs,

31:45.605 --> 31:47.585
you're gonna let her go.

31:47.605 --> 31:49.505
That's your price?

31:49.525 --> 31:50.595
It is.

31:50.615 --> 31:53.475
Doing a deal.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.585
Just like your father...
saving your skin.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.665
Not mine.

31:57.685 --> 31:59.665
Hers.

32:08.675 --> 32:11.475
No deal, I'm afraid.

32:11.495 --> 32:13.505
- What?
- Go on. Get up.

32:13.525 --> 32:15.515
Now.

32:15.535 --> 32:17.555
Jones, listen to me.
Please.

32:17.575 --> 32:20.495
Get up.
Put it on.

32:25.575 --> 32:27.545
Come on.

32:29.565 --> 32:32.475
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

32:36.525 --> 32:38.505
Signing out Harry Clarke.

32:38.525 --> 32:40.605
Okay.

32:49.495 --> 32:51.585
I left something.
I'll be right back.

32:56.505 --> 32:58.495
Fuck are you going?

33:19.545 --> 33:22.525
Can I help you, sir?

33:22.545 --> 33:23.685
Sir, get back in the car.

33:23.705 --> 33:26.525
Yeah, I will in a second.

33:26.545 --> 33:27.685
Get back in the car, sir.

33:32.505 --> 33:34.575
Gonna have to ask you
to show me your hands, sir.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.575
Sir?
Show me your hands!

34:08.695 --> 34:11.475
<i>Go back down the tunnel.
You'll see</i>

34:11.495 --> 34:14.554
a set of stairs. Take them
to the rear exit. Take a left.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.505
Head due south
for about five minutes. Run.

36:07.705 --> 36:09.705
That's him.
That's got to be Clarke.

36:10.485 --> 36:12.605
All right, let's go. Go get him.

36:59.595 --> 37:02.675
We got him. We got him.
We've got you, man, we got you.

37:10.555 --> 37:13.565
Clear! Go! Get inside!
Upstairs!

37:35.635 --> 37:37.595
Fletcher here.

37:37.615 --> 37:39.515
<i>Go ahead, Fletch.</i>

37:39.535 --> 37:42.565
Tell Colonel Russell
we have eyes on Aminata Sissoko.

38:00.615 --> 38:03.625
Hey.

38:03.645 --> 38:06.525
- Hey, Amanda.
- Natalie, thank you so much for doing this.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.525
Yeah, yeah, no problem at all.

38:08.545 --> 38:11.595
Evie, your mommy's here.

38:11.615 --> 38:12.675
Do you want to come in?

38:12.695 --> 38:14.555
- Another time.
- Okay.

38:14.575 --> 38:15.595
Thank you.
Hey, sweetie.

38:15.615 --> 38:17.595
Come on, let's go.

38:17.615 --> 38:18.685
Thank you.

38:18.705 --> 38:20.585
Where are we going?

38:26.475 --> 38:28.485
Here, look at this.

38:28.505 --> 38:31.645
Dan Lotz founded a company
importing solar panels

38:31.665 --> 38:34.605
three weeks after we left Mali.

38:34.625 --> 38:38.475
Do you think that's how
he was bringing in the arms?

38:38.495 --> 38:39.605
There's a silent partner here.

38:39.625 --> 38:42.605
Funded the start-up costs.
Lila Lotz.

38:42.625 --> 38:44.695
Well, that's got to be
a relation.

38:46.545 --> 38:47.635
His granddaughter.

38:47.655 --> 38:49.565
- 12 years old.
- Wow.

38:49.585 --> 38:51.555
That's a little bit young
for an investor.

38:51.575 --> 38:54.645
Wait, I saw something...
in his tax returns.

38:57.685 --> 39:00.575
He set up a trust
for her education.

39:00.595 --> 39:03.565
Already made
a down payment for...

39:03.585 --> 39:05.655
the fees for a school
in Washington, D.C....

39:05.675 --> 39:08.595
Georgetown International.

39:09.705 --> 39:12.595
Ooh, very fancy.

39:14.575 --> 39:17.535
Set up ten years ago with an
endowment from a charity called

39:17.555 --> 39:20.575
American United Resources.

39:23.565 --> 39:25.575
Which is a charitable arm

39:25.595 --> 39:29.555
of Kingsley, Merchant,
Proctor and Hall... KMPH.

39:38.635 --> 39:40.545
We have our link.

39:41.565 --> 39:43.485
Get down! Get down!

39:51.655 --> 39:54.555
- I'm complying. I'm complying!
- Hands where I can see them!

39:57.505 --> 39:58.585
I'm gonna answer this, okay?

39:58.605 --> 40:00.505
- Ma'am, I will shoot you.
- It's just...

40:00.525 --> 40:02.535
- it's just my phone!
- Do not move!

40:02.555 --> 40:05.675
- Do not fucking move!
- I'm complying, it's just my phone! I need

40:05.695 --> 40:08.695
to answer this, I'm gonna answer
my phone, I'm gonna fucking

40:09.475 --> 40:11.475
answer my phone!

40:11.495 --> 40:12.625
It's a phone, okay?

40:12.645 --> 40:15.515
It's just a fucking phone!

40:15.535 --> 40:17.545
- <i>Do not fucking move! I will shoot you!</i>
- <i>It's just a phone!</i>

40:17.565 --> 40:18.695
Leyla.

40:19.475 --> 40:21.635
<i>Leyla!</i>

40:21.655 --> 40:24.475
<i>Hello?</i>

40:24.495 --> 40:27.555
<i>This is Senator Meghan Sullivan
of the United States Congress.</i>

40:27.575 --> 40:28.705
<i>Who am I speaking to?</i>

40:29.485 --> 40:31.475
<i>Hello?</i>

40:31.495 --> 40:33.635
This is Colonel John Russell,
75th

40:33.655 --> 40:36.585
- <i>Ranger Regiment.</i>
- Colonel.

40:36.605 --> 40:40.595
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

40:48.665 --> 40:51.535
Come on, kiddo.

40:55.695 --> 40:58.475
Natalia.

40:59.495 --> 41:00.545
Amanda.

41:00.565 --> 41:01.675
This way.

41:30.705 --> 41:33.495
My name is Amanda Jones.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.645
I work for the CIA.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.635
And I wish to apply
for political asylum

41:45.655 --> 41:47.675
to the Russian government.

43:06.605 --> 43:08.665
I thought I lost you.

43:21.535 --> 43:25.545
Plenty of time for that later.

43:25.565 --> 43:26.665
Right now

43:26.685 --> 43:30.475
I think we need to talk.

43:51.665 --> 43:53.635
It's Senator Sullivan.

43:53.655 --> 43:56.515
I'm alone.

44:08.515 --> 44:10.625
Were you expecting someone else?

44:12.585 --> 44:15.515
I bet you're wondering

44:15.535 --> 44:17.555
why you haven't been picked up.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.695
I know what you were doing
in Mali

44:23.475 --> 44:24.695
two years ago, Mr. Miller.

44:25.475 --> 44:28.475
I know why Seracom
paid your ransom,

44:28.495 --> 44:31.505
and I know how and why KMPH

44:31.525 --> 44:32.705
armed Issouf Al Moctar.

44:35.475 --> 44:37.665
What you're going to do for me
is fill in the missing pieces.

44:39.595 --> 44:41.535
How it works here in D.C....

44:41.555 --> 44:46.495
you're going to bring the whole
damn thing crashing down.

44:46.515 --> 44:49.495
And in return, the Feds
are going to offer you a deal.

44:49.515 --> 44:52.515
You'll do time,
but not as much as you deserve.

44:54.585 --> 44:57.495
I'm being reinstated
to the Intelligence Committee.

44:59.485 --> 45:02.615
Turns out facts still
hold some sway in this town.

45:02.635 --> 45:05.575
First thing I'm gonna do
is hold open hearings.

45:05.595 --> 45:07.625
You will be subpoenaed.

45:11.685 --> 45:14.485
It's over, Mr. Miller.

45:16.555 --> 45:19.665
There's no shame.

45:19.685 --> 45:22.525
Everybody flips in the end.

45:53.535 --> 45:55.635
What did she offer you...
immunity?

45:57.655 --> 46:00.675
<i>You think I'm not
having you watched?</i>

46:00.695 --> 46:02.585
<i>And I know you're
calling me now</i>

46:02.605 --> 46:04.685
<i>to see what I can offer you.</i>

46:04.705 --> 46:07.645
<i>You're playing me off
against her.</i>

46:07.665 --> 46:11.605
You're my most
valuable player, Nathan.

46:16.645 --> 46:18.665
You don't think
I'm done with you?

46:21.615 --> 46:25.555
<i>So here it is:
you disappear.</i>

46:25.575 --> 46:27.475
<i>No one hears from you.</i>

46:27.495 --> 46:29.585
Not your wife,
not your daughter.

46:29.605 --> 46:31.595
Ever.

46:31.615 --> 46:34.515
You become a non-person, Nate.

46:34.535 --> 46:36.575
You cease to exist.

46:40.545 --> 46:42.565
<i>If, however, you decide to take</i>

46:42.585 --> 46:44.605
Sullivan's offer...

46:47.705 --> 46:50.595
My brother lost his little girl.

46:50.615 --> 46:53.695
<i>Stella.
Seven years old.</i>

46:55.495 --> 46:57.535
<i>That was 41 years ago.</i>

46:58.585 --> 47:01.675
He's as much of a wreck now
as he was then.

47:03.705 --> 47:06.485
<i>You never get over it, Nate.</i>

47:07.635 --> 47:11.675
<i>That's not something you want
to find out for yourself.</i>

47:31.665 --> 47:33.535
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:34.645 --> 47:36.545
You okay?

47:36.565 --> 47:38.565
You mind if I-if I...
if I-if I come in?

47:38.585 --> 47:39.615
Can I come in?

47:39.635 --> 47:41.655
Sure.

47:52.625 --> 47:53.705
Daddy?

47:58.685 --> 48:00.655
Hey, sweetheart.

48:00.675 --> 48:03.555
I got a merit
for my bird project.

48:03.575 --> 48:06.605
Oh, honey, that is so great.

48:06.625 --> 48:08.545
Did you know
the California Condor

48:08.565 --> 48:10.685
is one of the world's
longest-living birds?

48:10.705 --> 48:14.545
I did not know that, no.
Is that right?

48:14.565 --> 48:17.585
There are 137 of them
living in the wild.

48:17.605 --> 48:19.545
137?

48:19.565 --> 48:21.635
- 137... in the wild?
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:21.655 --> 48:23.515
Not in, like, a living room?

48:23.535 --> 48:25.705
- Not in a living room.
- No? Okay.

48:26.485 --> 48:28.515
Hey, before I forget...

48:32.645 --> 48:34.505
I love you.

48:34.525 --> 48:36.495
But why would you forget?

48:36.515 --> 48:38.705
Well, you know, sometimes,

48:39.485 --> 48:42.515
people forget to say
the things that they mean.

48:43.575 --> 48:45.505
And I mean it.

48:46.685 --> 48:48.705
I love you.

48:49.485 --> 48:51.505
I love you, too.

49:01.655 --> 49:03.555
Thank you.

49:03.575 --> 49:05.565
What is it, Nate?
Come on.

49:05.585 --> 49:07.495
Talk to me.

49:13.695 --> 49:16.585
I wanted to matter...

49:16.605 --> 49:18.665
Nicole.

49:18.685 --> 49:21.515
What are you talking about,
Nathan? You-you matter.

49:22.645 --> 49:24.605
You matter to me.
You matter to Katie.

49:24.625 --> 49:27.495
But that wasn't enough, was it?

49:27.515 --> 49:30.545
If I'm being honest with myself,
I wasn't here.

49:31.665 --> 49:34.605
Which means what?
It means that...

49:37.475 --> 49:40.515
...that the other thing
that I did with my life...

49:42.505 --> 49:43.685
...was more important to me.

49:47.545 --> 49:49.545
You know, I, um...

49:50.645 --> 49:53.655
My whole life...

49:55.705 --> 49:59.695
My whole life, I wanted
to see what it was like

50:00.475 --> 50:02.685
on the inside
of that velvet rope.

50:08.635 --> 50:11.625
And once you...

50:11.645 --> 50:13.675
you get that invitation...

50:15.685 --> 50:17.565
...to the party...

50:19.515 --> 50:23.485
...and you're there,
and you're...

50:23.505 --> 50:25.525
you're drinking...

50:28.515 --> 50:30.485
...you realize that you don't
have anything in common

50:30.505 --> 50:31.605
with the people there.

50:33.635 --> 50:36.525
And you realize...

50:49.535 --> 50:51.615
And you left the people
that you love...

50:54.555 --> 50:57.555
...the most...

50:57.575 --> 50:59.615
in this whole...

50:59.635 --> 51:02.595
world...

51:02.615 --> 51:05.565
on the other side of that rope.

51:09.635 --> 51:11.655
I am sorry.

51:14.595 --> 51:16.615
I am...

51:20.495 --> 51:21.695
I am so...

51:23.575 --> 51:25.545
...so...

51:26.635 --> 51:28.695
...sorry.

51:31.485 --> 51:32.675
Nate.

51:42.535 --> 51:44.555
I know.

51:52.525 --> 51:54.675
<i>And with Yambo Kanté
being implicated in the Al Moctar</i>

51:54.695 --> 51:57.585
- <i>arms scandal, Aminata Sissoko</i>
- Thank you.

51:57.605 --> 52:00.595
<i>is expected to become
interim president after</i>

52:00.615 --> 52:02.525
<i>she was cleared yesterday
at the high court.</i>

52:02.545 --> 52:05.495
You should come with me.

52:06.515 --> 52:07.635
Work for you?

52:07.655 --> 52:10.475
I can't think of anyone else

52:10.495 --> 52:11.705
I'd rather have by my side.

52:15.505 --> 52:17.475
I'd love to.

52:17.495 --> 52:18.625
Thank you.

52:30.585 --> 52:32.605
- See her?
- Yeah, I see her.

52:36.625 --> 52:39.495
I'm going to run again.

52:39.515 --> 52:41.485
For reelection.

52:41.505 --> 52:43.485
As an independent.

52:44.665 --> 52:46.575
You think you stand a chance?

52:47.625 --> 52:50.495
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

52:57.635 --> 52:59.605
Hey.

53:01.635 --> 53:03.605
I didn't know
you were going to come.

53:03.625 --> 53:05.675
Oh, you think I'd miss
your moment in the sun?

53:07.595 --> 53:09.585
You deserve this, Meaghan.

53:13.515 --> 53:14.635
Thank you.

53:17.545 --> 53:19.675
I should, uh...

53:19.695 --> 53:21.525
Yeah.

53:23.505 --> 53:24.575
Go.

53:35.495 --> 53:37.585
I call this hearing to order.

53:37.605 --> 53:41.565
I call on our first witness,
Nathan Shane Miller.

53:43.645 --> 53:45.705
We don't want to deal
with the Americans on this.

53:46.485 --> 53:47.585
Completely understand.

53:47.605 --> 53:49.655
Our company is wholly
Australian-owned,

53:49.675 --> 53:51.705
and we would take every care

53:52.485 --> 53:54.665
to ensure that the Malian people
and the Malian government

53:54.685 --> 53:56.705
share equally
in the wealth generated

53:57.485 --> 53:59.485
by our mining operations.

54:01.515 --> 54:02.705
Okay.

54:03.485 --> 54:04.615
Because we need a change.

54:33.575 --> 54:35.595
Thank you.

54:37.615 --> 54:39.545
Let it be recorded

54:39.565 --> 54:42.475
that the witness, Nathan Miller,
has not shown.

54:42.495 --> 54:45.505
I have been advised
that a warrant

54:45.525 --> 54:47.645
will be issued for his arrest.

54:47.665 --> 54:51.555
He will not defy the will
of the American people.

54:51.575 --> 54:53.535
This committee is adjourned.

54:54.575 --> 54:56.675
Son of a bitch.

54:58.585 --> 55:00.565
Gentlemen,

55:00.585 --> 55:02.515
the Middle East is fucked.

55:02.535 --> 55:05.495
We should know.
We fucked it.

55:06.585 --> 55:09.575
Six of the ten
fastest-growing economies

55:09.595 --> 55:12.595
are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

55:12.615 --> 55:15.565
Countries rich
in mineral wealth.

55:16.585 --> 55:18.525
Coltan for our computers,

55:18.545 --> 55:20.605
cobalt for our batteries,

55:20.625 --> 55:23.565
phosphates for our agriculture,

55:23.585 --> 55:26.615
nuclear ore for our power.

55:26.635 --> 55:28.605
These are the things, gentlemen,

55:28.625 --> 55:30.695
that the wars
of the next 20, 30 years

55:31.475 --> 55:33.645
will be fought over.

55:33.665 --> 55:37.585
A huge deposit of cobalt
was discovered in Mali

55:37.605 --> 55:40.565
just over two years ago.

55:40.585 --> 55:42.605
Back then, we approached
the Malian government

55:42.625 --> 55:44.565
about mining rights.

55:44.585 --> 55:46.695
They told us...
that those rights

55:47.475 --> 55:49.505
were going to the Chinese.

55:50.685 --> 55:54.635
<i>So we set about to create
the conditions to make sure</i>

55:54.655 --> 55:57.475
<i>that wouldn't happen.</i>

55:59.505 --> 56:02.575
And just last week, uh...

56:02.595 --> 56:04.615
one of our Australian
subsidiaries...

56:04.635 --> 56:05.685
thank you, Lachlan...

56:05.705 --> 56:08.695
secured those rights.

56:09.475 --> 56:11.605
Our pilot project in Mali

56:11.625 --> 56:13.485
hit a few bumps,

56:13.505 --> 56:14.655
<i>but I'm delighted</i>

56:14.675 --> 56:17.595
to report that it worked.

56:17.615 --> 56:20.545
<i>And if it can work there,</i>

56:20.565 --> 56:22.585
there's no reason it can't work

56:22.605 --> 56:24.585
in other mineral-rich countries

56:24.605 --> 56:26.625
across Africa.

56:28.475 --> 56:31.505
We create the chaos...

56:31.525 --> 56:34.605
and then we move in
and capitalize on that chaos.

56:36.635 --> 56:38.555
We're looking at the long-term
here, gentlemen.

56:39.635 --> 56:42.665
Rates of return that'll make
Iraq and Afghanistan

56:42.685 --> 56:45.475
look like chicken feed.
