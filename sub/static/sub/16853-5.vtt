WEBVTT

00:06.402 --> 00:08.005
Oh! I think it's working.

00:08.074 --> 00:10.175
Don't break open
the champagne just yet.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.379
This may look straightforward, but there's
a lot going on behind the scenes.

00:13.448 --> 00:16.717
Anything...can...happen.

00:16.753 --> 00:19.187
But it didn't, and we are done!

00:19.256 --> 00:20.255
Sew her up!

00:20.290 --> 00:21.790
Okay. Thanks, everybody.

00:21.826 --> 00:23.558
Wow, Glenn.

00:23.627 --> 00:25.394
That was so amazing.

00:25.462 --> 00:27.095
I'm so impressed.

00:27.131 --> 00:29.798
Oh, any pediatrician
can throw in a kid's heart.

00:29.834 --> 00:33.202
It's the stuff you've been doing
lately -- that's the real stuff.

00:33.271 --> 00:33.836
Yeah?

00:33.871 --> 00:35.171
What stuff do you mean?

00:35.206 --> 00:36.539
A-all. All of it.

00:36.574 --> 00:37.474
You think?

00:37.542 --> 00:40.745
Oh, I don't
have to think, I feel.

00:45.686 --> 00:47.654
And cut.

00:47.723 --> 00:48.489
Cut!

00:48.558 --> 00:49.758
I said cut, cut, cut, cut.

00:49.826 --> 00:51.727
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

00:52.151 --> 00:54.617
Obviously you <i>did</i> hear
me, 'cause you responded the

00:54.685 --> 00:55.584
third time I said it.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.397
Maybe if you said it
louder the first time, then it

00:57.517 --> 00:58.371
wouldn't be an issue.

00:58.491 --> 00:59.561
There's no issue, honey.

00:59.681 --> 01:01.690
My wife, everybody.

01:01.726 --> 01:03.525
I guess I made my
own bed, right?

01:03.594 --> 01:05.420
Moving on. Hallway scene, let's go.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.418
Sorry, David, David.
One sec.

01:07.538 --> 01:10.966
Um, I just, uh... I hate
to be <i>that</i> actress, you

01:11.002 --> 01:14.436
know, and I just -- but I have
to say, and I know you have so

01:14.472 --> 01:18.507
much other stuff to worry about,
but, you know, why am I just a

01:18.542 --> 01:19.908
glorified nurse in that scene?

01:19.977 --> 01:23.512
Let me say a word about
what the network thinks, okay?

01:23.547 --> 01:24.513
You're our anchor.

01:24.549 --> 01:25.448
Uh-huh.

01:25.516 --> 01:27.020
Lynn, you
are our anchor.

01:27.140 --> 01:27.690
Right.

01:27.810 --> 01:31.053
You have grown old on
this show, audiences know you.

01:31.088 --> 01:34.457
We would just like audiences
to know Dixie a little more.

01:34.526 --> 01:37.895
What Jessica said is--
Look, I am your

01:37.930 --> 01:41.799
biggest cheerleader at the network, and
believe me, it is not an easy job.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.166
Has anyone seen my iPad?

01:43.202 --> 01:44.985
Hey, everybody.
I'm glad I caught you.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.124
This is Jake, my nephew.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.443
He's interning here now and
he's a huge fan of the show.

01:50.512 --> 01:51.711
This is Lynn Williams.

01:51.747 --> 01:53.146
I know who you are.

01:53.182 --> 01:53.814
Will you sign this?

01:53.882 --> 01:54.715
Of course.

01:54.784 --> 01:56.083
I photoshopped it.

01:56.152 --> 01:56.818
You're my favorite.

01:56.853 --> 01:58.553
You were my favorite
five years ago.

01:58.622 --> 01:59.821
Right now, Dixie's my favorite.

01:59.890 --> 02:00.555
Is Dixie here?

02:00.591 --> 02:01.356
Yeah.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.824
I want to meet her next.

02:02.860 --> 02:06.262
I also put in Chinese Santa Claus
because, like, what does that even mean?

02:06.297 --> 02:07.430
What does that mean?!

02:07.465 --> 02:10.300
You want to come to my dressing
room and rehearse in 20 minutes?

02:10.369 --> 02:13.103
Yes, just tell
me when and where.

02:14.406 --> 02:15.439
Hey, Dixie.

02:15.474 --> 02:16.573
Great wedding last week.

02:16.642 --> 02:17.808
You know what?

02:17.843 --> 02:20.377
David and I were just so
happy to have you there.

02:20.446 --> 02:22.480
And thank you so much
for the dish towel.

02:22.549 --> 02:23.481
Cut the

02:23.550 --> 02:25.750
You and I both know that you
got hitched to the director...

02:25.819 --> 02:28.487
'Cause you don't have the
talent to make it on your own.

02:28.555 --> 02:30.355
How long you gonna
stay with him, huh?

02:30.390 --> 02:32.824
- How did you know what I was gonna...
- Say?

02:32.859 --> 02:33.558
Whoa.

02:33.593 --> 02:35.860
Honey, I've been playing
out this conversation in

02:35.896 --> 02:37.195
my head ever since the wedding.

02:37.230 --> 02:40.132
You think I stole your position on
the show just like I stole David.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.466
Well, guess what.

02:41.502 --> 02:43.401
He was given to me by him.

02:43.470 --> 02:46.504
So why don't you just --
Ohh, see.

02:46.573 --> 02:50.475
I've been playing out <i>this
conversation my</i> head since it

02:50.511 --> 02:52.110
began 30 seconds ago.

02:52.146 --> 02:55.781
- Two can play at this...
- Game.

02:55.816 --> 02:59.752
Justin...Timber...Bum.

02:59.787 --> 03:01.220
Game on, Lynn.

03:01.255 --> 03:04.490
Ms. Williams, them ready
for you in studio B.

03:04.525 --> 03:05.391
Game on.

03:05.426 --> 03:06.492
Yeah, she on her way.

03:06.528 --> 03:08.561
Them talking about some gay man.

03:08.597 --> 03:11.398
Dori, what time does
that staff meeting start?

03:11.433 --> 03:13.066
It started 10 minutes ago.

03:13.102 --> 03:15.135
Do you want me to tell them
that you're on your way?

03:16.606 --> 03:19.207
Uh...

03:19.242 --> 03:21.342
Um...Should we cut?

03:21.411 --> 03:23.611
He's sleeping again.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.412
Cut!

03:24.481 --> 03:27.315
Okay, let's break for brunch and
we'll try it again afterward.

03:27.351 --> 03:28.417
That's brunch, everybody!

03:28.485 --> 03:29.418
One hour for brunch!

03:30.821 --> 03:32.154
What is wrong with me?

03:32.190 --> 03:34.223
Did you
fall asleep again?

03:34.259 --> 03:35.425
Yes.

03:35.460 --> 03:39.229
Something's definitely
off, I can feel it.

03:39.264 --> 03:39.762
Ohh!

03:39.798 --> 03:41.431
I need a massage.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.334
Jake, you're a fan of the show,
it'd be a big treat for you.

03:44.370 --> 03:45.436
Yes, it would.

03:45.504 --> 03:47.071
Oh, good. Get over here.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.606
Ahh. Mind the tubes, boy.

03:48.641 --> 03:51.809
That dialysis machine is
filtering my rotten blood.

03:51.844 --> 03:54.244
You tweet that and
I'll stab you.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.615
<i>Mr. Huebel, there's a
Dr. Bloomfield waiting for you</i>

03:57.683 --> 03:58.682
<i>at reception.</i>

03:58.718 --> 04:01.085
<i>Send him in.</i>

04:01.153 --> 04:05.089
<i>Oy, this having a broken
kidney is no fun at all.</i>

04:08.427 --> 04:10.093
<i>Lady Jane, can I
ask you a question?</i>

04:11.197 --> 04:11.829
<i>Oh. Anything, ducky.</i>

04:11.864 --> 04:12.630
<i>Oh, good.</i>

04:12.698 --> 04:15.232
<i>Ah, well, have you ever felt
like someone's edging in on your</i>

04:15.268 --> 04:17.435
<i>territory, but there's just
nothing you can do about it</i>

04:17.470 --> 04:19.103
<i>because she's married
to the director?</i>

04:19.172 --> 04:22.373
<i>More times than
I can count, my dear.</i>

04:22.409 --> 04:26.177
<i>I was on a music hall tour with
a broad-shouldered Welshman.</i>

04:26.246 --> 04:29.748
<i>We were clog dancers, and we
pulled in for a two-nighter at</i>

04:29.817 --> 04:32.384
<i>Nesbie's place in Haymark.</i>

04:32.420 --> 04:35.721
<i>Now, this would before the fire,
of course, and there was no</i>

04:35.756 --> 04:36.655
<i>ventriloquist!</i>

04:38.559 --> 04:42.361
<i>Because Charlie Morton was
sloshed in Lambert Square,</i>

04:42.396 --> 04:46.731
<i>driving on the right side of the
road, which is the wrong side of</i>

04:46.800 --> 04:50.368
<i>the road, despite what you
colonists might think.</i>

04:50.436 --> 04:53.738
<i>And he was having a
one-sided conversation with</i>

04:53.774 --> 04:58.310
<i>donkey squires, which if you did
know donkey squires, you really</i>

04:58.345 --> 05:01.246
<i>would know that it's
not unusual at all.</i>

05:01.282 --> 05:03.115
<i>I don't know him.</i>

05:03.183 --> 05:04.116
<i>Action.</i>

05:04.151 --> 05:07.586
<i>Lola, if you hit my car
in the parking lot one more</i>

05:07.621 --> 05:09.221
<i>time, I'm gonna smack you.</i>

05:09.290 --> 05:10.122
<i>Oh!</i>

05:10.157 --> 05:11.757
<i>Chief, you said one more time.</i>

05:11.792 --> 05:13.559
<i>I thought I had one more time.</i>

05:13.594 --> 05:15.361
<i>Ha, you're right.</i>

05:15.396 --> 05:17.564
<i>You got me.</i>

05:17.599 --> 05:19.566
<i>And cut! Great.</i>

05:19.601 --> 05:23.770
<i>My advice would be
to drive a wedge between Dixie</i>

05:23.805 --> 05:25.405
<i>and David.</i>

05:27.442 --> 05:30.844
<i>Well, your remaining
kidney is essentially gone.</i>

05:30.880 --> 05:33.781
<i>You need to stay on your
dialysis machine 24 hours a day.</i>

05:33.849 --> 05:36.517
<i>If you go off it for even
a minute, you could die.</i>

05:36.552 --> 05:37.585
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

05:37.620 --> 05:38.786
<i>What do you know anyway?</i>

05:38.855 --> 05:40.421
<i>Look, Rob.</i>

05:40.457 --> 05:41.389
<i>I'm your doctor.</i>

05:41.424 --> 05:43.491
<i>I just tell you what
I see in the chart.</i>

05:43.560 --> 05:45.694
<i>Ultimately, you'll do
what you want to do.</i>

05:46.863 --> 05:49.330
<i>Oh, I have a robocall
from Verizon.</i>

05:49.399 --> 05:50.665
<i>I have to take this.</i>

05:50.700 --> 05:52.600
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

05:52.636 --> 05:56.404
<i>If the producers find out I'm
this sick, my career is over.</i>

05:56.439 --> 05:59.340
<i>I have an idea where you
can stay on your dialysis</i>

05:59.409 --> 06:04.312
<i>machine 24/7, still act on the
show, and no one will ever know.</i>

06:04.347 --> 06:05.513
<i>Speak.</i>

06:05.582 --> 06:07.415
<i>Space robots.</i>

06:07.484 --> 06:10.619
<i>It's only been nine and a half
minutes, Dr. Ritchie. You're early.</i>

06:10.654 --> 06:13.255
<i>I couldn't wait any longer
for my appointment, Dr. Black.</i>

06:13.324 --> 06:16.525
<i>I think I have to write
you a prescription for romance.</i>

06:20.831 --> 06:21.598
<i>And cut!</i>

06:21.633 --> 06:22.231
<i>Aaah!</i>

06:22.267 --> 06:23.599
<i>Did you
hear me that time?</i>

06:23.635 --> 06:24.434
<i>Was it loud enough?</i>

06:24.469 --> 06:26.436
<i>David, how long have
you been standing there?</i>

06:26.504 --> 06:29.172
<i>No, it looks like the scene's
in really, really, good shape.</i>

06:29.208 --> 06:30.540
<i>Don't even
go there, David.</i>

06:30.609 --> 06:31.708
<i>We were clearly just rehearsing.</i>

06:31.744 --> 06:32.776
<i>I'm serious, Dixie.</i>

06:32.812 --> 06:33.344
<i>I love it.</i>

06:33.412 --> 06:34.078
<i>David.</i>

06:34.146 --> 06:35.613
<i>Thank you, Mr. wain.</i>

06:37.116 --> 06:38.249
<i>Hi. No, hold on.</i>

06:38.284 --> 06:39.083
<i>Just one moment.</i>

06:39.152 --> 06:41.820
<i>I don't want to be that actress
but, you know, I never rehearsed</i>

06:41.855 --> 06:43.822
<i>a kissing scene when I
was married to you.</i>

06:43.891 --> 06:46.525
<i>Lynn, I can't --
Just -- David, just</i>

06:46.561 --> 06:47.727
<i>open your eyes, okay?</i>

06:47.762 --> 06:49.829
<i>Dixie has been screwing
falcon for months.</i>

06:49.864 --> 06:50.830
<i>I knew it.</i>

06:50.898 --> 06:54.100
<i>I'm so sorry, but I do
have an idea for some changes to</i>

06:54.169 --> 06:56.636
<i>the love scene that I think
you might find interesting.</i>

06:57.906 --> 06:59.172
<i>Okay. Find me.</i>

06:59.208 --> 07:01.275
<i>Greetings, master David.</i>

07:01.343 --> 07:05.178
<i>I am C-3PO, Childrens Hospital's
resident protocol droid and this</i>

07:05.247 --> 07:07.113
<i>is my counterpart, r2-d2.</i>

07:07.182 --> 07:10.383
<i>And I'm Owen Skywalker,
Jedi pediatrician.</i>

07:10.452 --> 07:11.551
<i>What do you think, David?</i>

07:11.619 --> 07:14.186
<i>This could be a really great
thing for my character.</i>

07:14.222 --> 07:17.724
<i>No, and that r2 unit looks
like it has a bad motivator.</i>

07:17.759 --> 07:20.760
<i>Oh, I guess we'll just
have to go over his head.</i>

07:20.829 --> 07:23.196
<i>Oh, I need slack
on my blood tube.</i>

07:23.265 --> 07:24.564
<i>Scene 40 on stage 3.</i>

07:24.600 --> 07:25.765
<i>Careful, you.</i>

07:25.834 --> 07:29.101
<i>I have ways of knowing if
you do less than your best.</i>

07:29.170 --> 07:31.170
<i>Oh, my God,
what are you doing?</i>

07:31.205 --> 07:34.039
<i>You're putting splootches all
over my face for my love scene.</i>

07:34.108 --> 07:35.107
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

07:35.175 --> 07:36.375
<i>It's new pages.</i>

07:36.410 --> 07:39.477
<i>I don't know who wrote them, but
from now on, Cat Black has this</i>

07:39.546 --> 07:42.480
<i>contagious virus and she's got
to be in this plastic bubble.</i>

07:42.549 --> 07:43.648
<i>What? Why?</i>

07:43.683 --> 07:45.082
<i>This is so confusing.</i>

07:45.118 --> 07:46.317
<i>I don't understand it.</i>

07:46.352 --> 07:48.285
<i>I didn't get these pages.</i>

07:50.589 --> 07:54.659
<i>Well, game set, almost
match, advantage Lynn.</i>

07:54.728 --> 07:56.394
<i>Check and checkmate.</i>

07:56.463 --> 07:58.663
<i>I still have one
more ace up my sleeve.</i>

07:58.732 --> 08:00.098
<i>First and 10, 35 yards to go.</i>

08:00.133 --> 08:00.765
<i>Game on.</i>

08:00.834 --> 08:02.200
<i>Oh, you game on.</i>

08:02.235 --> 08:03.367
<i>No, you game on.</i>

08:03.403 --> 08:06.203
<i>It's game on, not gay mon.</i>

08:06.239 --> 08:08.239
<i>Tomayto, tomahto.</i>

08:09.675 --> 08:10.507
<i>What is that?</i>

08:10.543 --> 08:13.377
<i>The virus makes
your character smell bad.</i>

08:13.412 --> 08:15.579
<i>Does that
even show up on TV?</i>

08:15.615 --> 08:16.747
<i>Yes and no.</i>

08:16.782 --> 08:18.115
<i>Action!</i>

08:18.151 --> 08:21.152
<i>Oh, it's only been nine and
a half minutes, Dr. Ritchie.</i>

08:21.187 --> 08:21.753
<i>You're early.</i>

08:21.788 --> 08:25.423
<i>I couldn't wait any longer
for my appointment, Dr. Black.</i>

08:25.458 --> 08:29.493
<i>My God, I want to kiss you so
badly right now, but I'd rather</i>

08:29.529 --> 08:33.297
<i>not get your deadly virus.</i>

08:33.332 --> 08:37.235
<i>I rather die than
not be with you, Glenn.</i>

08:37.303 --> 08:38.503
<i>No, no, no. No, no.</i>

08:38.571 --> 08:39.604
<i>That's not in the script.</i>

08:39.639 --> 08:40.705
<i>Game off, Dixie.</i>

08:40.773 --> 08:41.505
<i>Game off.</i>

08:41.541 --> 08:43.508
<i>Jessica, I am so sorry.</i>

08:43.576 --> 08:46.845
<i>I promise you, it will never--
Stop happening?</i>

08:46.880 --> 08:48.080
<i>I hope so, David.</i>

08:48.149 --> 08:51.083
<i>This is exactly the kind of
thing the networks want.</i>

08:51.152 --> 08:52.151
<i>Keep it rolling!</i>

08:52.186 --> 08:53.486
<i>It was a brilliant idea.</i>

08:53.521 --> 08:54.687
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:54.723 --> 08:56.223
<i>It's a miracle!</i>

08:56.258 --> 08:56.790
<i>I'm cured!</i>

08:56.858 --> 09:01.428
<i>Cat, I'm a Jedi knight, and my
droids and I came here to cheer you up.</i>

09:01.464 --> 09:02.429
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

09:02.498 --> 09:04.231
<i>I told him --
I approved it.</i>

09:04.266 --> 09:05.365
<i>The Sci-Fi kids will love it.</i>

09:05.434 --> 09:06.266
<i>Can we cut?</i>

09:06.302 --> 09:08.268
<i>She smells like a
dill weed omelet.</i>

09:12.507 --> 09:13.774
<i>Sorry.</i>

09:13.809 --> 09:17.277
<i>I always forget that you
colonies don't drive indoors.</i>

09:17.345 --> 09:20.346
<i>It's our teeth that are
the problem, really.</i>

09:20.414 --> 09:24.083
<i>And the rain and tea time,
Benny hill, the queen.</i>

09:24.119 --> 09:25.051
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

09:25.086 --> 09:26.719
<i>That's not r2-d2.</i>

09:26.754 --> 09:29.255
<i>Are you on dialysis?</i>

09:29.290 --> 09:32.358
<i>I have to be tethered
to that machine or I'll die.</i>

09:32.427 --> 09:34.426
<i>So I guess my career
here is over.</i>

09:34.462 --> 09:35.561
<i>Wait, Rob.</i>

09:35.630 --> 09:38.731
<i>The machine is smashed to bits
and you seem -- you seem fine.</i>

09:38.800 --> 09:42.368
<i>But that doctor said that --
I said that</i>

09:42.437 --> 09:46.705
<i>because I knew all you needed was the
confidence to believe in yourself.</i>

09:46.741 --> 09:48.541
<i>That's all you ever needed.</i>

09:48.576 --> 09:50.342
<i>No machine on earth
can deliver that.</i>

09:50.378 --> 09:52.245
<i>Wait, I really
don't understand.</i>

09:52.280 --> 09:55.181
<i>And that's the
only thing that you all need.</i>

09:55.216 --> 09:57.483
<i>Lynn, it's not about
being the bigger star.</i>

09:57.552 --> 10:01.454
<i>Everyone can have a good part in
the great TV show we call life.</i>

10:01.489 --> 10:02.755
<i>I see that now.</i>

10:02.791 --> 10:05.825
<i>And, David,
you definitely direct the</i>

10:05.860 --> 10:07.360
<i>elements on the set.</i>

10:07.395 --> 10:11.264
<i>But in your own life, you've
forgotten the foundation of a</i>

10:11.299 --> 10:12.665
<i>relationship is trust.</i>

10:12.733 --> 10:14.166
<i>Jessica, beautiful Jessica.</i>

10:14.201 --> 10:17.102
<i>You've been work, work, work so
much, you've lost sight of what</i>

10:17.171 --> 10:19.171
<i>you're working for.</i>

10:19.206 --> 10:20.739
<i>Call your mother.</i>

10:20.774 --> 10:22.207
<i>I will, I promise.</i>

10:22.242 --> 10:23.842
<i>But seriously,
what's going on?</i>

10:23.877 --> 10:25.577
<i>Cutter Spindell.</i>

10:25.612 --> 10:26.645
<i>Yeah, do me.</i>

10:26.680 --> 10:30.181
<i>Make the most of these
last 10 days you have left on earth.</i>

10:30.217 --> 10:31.116
<i>Whoa. What?</i>

10:31.151 --> 10:33.852
<i>And, falcon, your
thing is the crazy eyes and stuff.</i>

10:33.887 --> 10:35.120
<i>You get it?</i>

10:35.188 --> 10:37.755
<i>Dixie
Peters, you're doing great.</i>

10:37.824 --> 10:38.489
<i>No notes.</i>

10:38.558 --> 10:39.590
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

10:39.626 --> 10:40.658
<i>Thanks. Thank you.</i>

10:40.693 --> 10:42.660
<i>And you.</i>

10:42.729 --> 10:46.464
<i>Yes, all of you.</i>

10:46.499 --> 10:50.443
<i>Don't we all have secrets
we keep behind the scenes?</i>

10:50.563 --> 10:51.869
<i>Do your doctor know that
camera's not rolling?</i>

10:51.904 --> 10:54.571
<i>I don't know what
the hell's going on.</i>
