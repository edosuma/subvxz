00:23.815 --> 00:25.817
It's sad, isn't it?

00:25.984 --> 00:29.579
I've been working
with you seven years.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.161
Seven years.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.666
I always liked you.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.672
Always looked after you.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.969
I never trusted you.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.709
That's the secret?

02:43.872 --> 02:47.092
- Yep.
- Yeah, she's right, Tes.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.127
Everybody knows that already.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.638
Yeah, why don't you tell us another one?

02:51.797 --> 02:53.970
Fine.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.682
fake it.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.142
That's definitely not a secret.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.307
It kinda is.

03:02.474 --> 03:06.069
All right, so how does
that relate to what we're doing now?

03:06.228 --> 03:09.152
I'll tell you.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.318
See, most women apply
secret number two to one thing--

03:12.484 --> 03:15.158
sex. The rest of the time
we're too real.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.322
Too real because it's
in our nature to be real,

03:17.489 --> 03:19.583
which ultimately
is a woman's downfall.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.120
But faking it keeps you
living in man's land.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.880
Whoa! Who the fuck
wants to live in man's land?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.757
We're already living in it, guys.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.385
All right, wait wait, let me
ask you a question then.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.048
Would you be faking it
if you compromise?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.717
'Cause you can't fake
compromise.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.102
You half can.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.389
What the fuck
does that mean?

03:41.555 --> 03:45.105
Compromise is half faking.
'Cause if you weren't compromising half

03:45.267 --> 03:48.521
you would have it all, in which case
you wouldn't be faking.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.736
You would be taking.
For example,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.617
guys compromise when they
leave the toilet seat down.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.870
They do it because
they know they can't win.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.406
And I'm not faking it
'cause I don't pretend not to mind

03:59.573 --> 04:02.122
when they do leave
the toilet seat up-- because I do.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.756
Slow it down. How is that
a compromise on your end?

04:07.914 --> 04:10.212
Yeah, and I thought that
you said we should fake it?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.049
It's a compromise because I'd fake
other things to get my way.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.259
Or I'd take away the pussy.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.136
What are you even talking about?

04:20.302 --> 04:21.928
I think
you're confusing yourself.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.099
No no, I think it's just
too complicated for you to understand.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.359
No, it's not at all.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.895
I get what you're saying.
I just don't agree with you.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.235
To me compromising
is not faking.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.619
Fine. Then we'll just agree
to disagree.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.783
Or we could agree that I'm right
because that's a compromise.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.326
Tell you what:

04:44.493 --> 04:47.463
I'll fake it
and we can agree on that.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.623
Okay.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.714
But you're compromising
to agree on faking it.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.467
I can explain it to you
if it's too complicated.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.474
I think she got you
on that one, Tes, sorry.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.435
Thanks.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.145
Hey'

05:07.307 --> 05:09.685
Kara!

05:09.851 --> 05:12.650
- What?
- Quit staring at that guy.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.158
- I'm not staring.
- Yeah, you are staring.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.410
Do you know what the word
"conspicuous" means?

05:18.568 --> 05:20.946
Or do you want me to explain
that to you as well?

05:21.112 --> 05:24.207
- Kara, stop staring.
- I'm not conspicuous.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.243
We're the only girls in here
with all our teeth.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.753
We're very fucking conspicuous.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.381
Okay, but what if that's our guy?
I mean, didn't Mel--

05:31.540 --> 05:33.292
Do you see
an orange rig outside?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.592
What do you guys think
about Harry and Sally?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.720
What about them?

05:44.886 --> 05:46.934
You don't worry about them, Kara.
They're harmless.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.397
So what if we missed him?
We spent, what? 20 minutes

05:50.559 --> 05:53.312
with Deputy Elmore.
What if he came and left?

06:02.445 --> 06:04.573
So, Tes, what are we doing?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.116
Do you have a plan?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.331
Mel did say 2:30.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.595
All right.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.393
So I'm guessing she runs the place.
And there's no way

06:24.551 --> 06:27.304
this shit goes down here
without her getting a piece of the pie.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.598
If anyone knows anything,
it's her.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.233
Okay.
Okay, great, I'll take her.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.362
- Let's find out what she knows.
- Mm-hmm.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.073
- I'll take the door.
- Guess I got the trucker.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.079
I'm not even gonna say it

06:44.237 --> 06:45.830
'cause you all know what this is.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.959
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?

06:51.036 --> 06:54.165

knows where the fucking truck is?

we could use some gas money.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.043
45 bucks?
Fucking jerkoff

The deal is we're going
to some shitty isolated diner.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.613
- Where?
- Somewhere across the river.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.374
Why would Mel
send us over there?

12:21.532 --> 12:23.034
He's never sent us
out of the parish before.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.579
'Cause something big
has come up.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.624
Apparently someone's running
a shipment along Mel's route.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.383
Who?

12:30.541 --> 12:33.841
Don't know,
but Mel doesn't like it.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.475
There's a driver who's picking up
a preloaded rig down in the Gulf.

12:38.633 --> 12:42.638
He brings it up the 220 and delivers
the bricks to another driver

12:42.804 --> 12:44.556
who's waiting with the cash.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.396
- Who's the driver?
- That's where we come in.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.981
Mel wants us to get
ahold of the shipment

12:50.144 --> 12:52.567
and find out who the pickup is.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.233
Which brings me to the best part
of this whole operation:

12:55.400 --> 12:58.745
neither man knows the other.
They only know where the diner is.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.201
So driver A isn't going
to do something stupid

13:01.364 --> 13:03.412
and risk getting caught
with a load of dope.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.576
He'll just drive away.
And same goes for B.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.371
I mean the last thing he's going to do is go crying to
the feds

13:08.538 --> 13:10.791
about his drug money
getting ripped off.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.506
We just make sure
we get there before they do

13:13.668 --> 13:15.466
and wait for one of them to show.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.891
Hey!

13:20.049 --> 13:22.677
What?

13:22.844 --> 13:25.768
I was listening.
Other side of the river. Fine.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.774
It's fine?
It's a big fucking deal, Kara,

13:28.933 --> 13:30.606
so you might want
to pay attention.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.396
Mel wouldn't be too happy
if we fucked this one up too.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.486
Speaking of which...

13:59.088 --> 14:01.762
- Yeah?
- South on the 140.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.722
Other side of the swamp.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.764
Look for an alligator crawling
across the Chinaman's back.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.933
2:30.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.286
Well?

14:22.445 --> 14:25.119
140 south, 40 miles.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.882
What have we got here?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.818
What's going on?

15:00.191 --> 15:01.659
Evenin'!

15:01.818 --> 15:03.786
Eve-evening.

15:03.945 --> 15:07.495
- Little car trouble? Oh.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.669
Oh, it looks like your tires
are a little low there.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.330
- Uh, yeah yeah.
- Yeah?

15:13.496 --> 15:15.373
- It sure is.
- That's not good to be out here

15:15.540 --> 15:17.417
at this time of night
without any air in your tires.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.755
No.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.171
We got us skeeters out here
the size of footballs.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.010
If the heat don't get you,

15:23.172 --> 15:24.890
they sure as hell will.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.596
That's a recipe
for problems right there.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.103
First thing you're fixin' your tire.
The next thing you know,

15:29.262 --> 15:31.811
you're lying on the side of the road
dying of heat exhaustion.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.146
What's your name, pardner?

15:34.308 --> 15:36.936
Indicott.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.822
Because I'm--
I'm-- I'm not in the car.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.904
I'm out of a pot.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.910
I'm Indicott. Get it?

15:46.237 --> 15:48.114
Which is where
I wish I was right now

15:48.281 --> 15:50.909
because I'm so tired
and it's so so so hot out here.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.043
It is hot, isn't it, Indicott?

15:54.912 --> 15:56.880
Well, Indicott, what seems
to be the problem?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.416
You got a busted hose
or something?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.051
Some-- some--
something like that.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.586
- I-- I-- I--
- Yeah?

16:01.752 --> 16:03.504
I just-- I just--
I just can't-- can't-can't-can't

16:03.671 --> 16:05.673
seem to manage this engine.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.059
- Mm-hmm.
- It's just-- it's just-- it's just--

16:08.217 --> 16:10.265
I don't know what to do because

16:10.428 --> 16:12.351
I gotta get to my girl.
And she-- she's--

16:12.513 --> 16:14.106
she's just as sweet as a daisy.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.267
And this-- this-- this--

16:16.434 --> 16:18.937
this thingamajig right here,
it's just-- it's just--

16:19.103 --> 16:20.104
it's just-- I-- I--

16:20.271 --> 16:23.275
I just don't know
how to handle motors.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.785
Well, you're in good hands
tonight, Indicott.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.571
Why don't you step out of there for
a sec, let me take a quick look at it?

16:28.738 --> 16:29.830
- Would you? Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.789
Hold on to this. I used to race
big blocks down in Douglas Parish.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.579
I know a thing or two
about engines.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.340
It's probably just
a busted hose or something.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.501
Cuidado. Cuidado.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.964
Care-- care-- careful.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.508
Careful.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.299
God damn, it's hot out here!

16:48.466 --> 16:51.936
You know, last year this time they hit
about a buck 10 over in Bronson.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.267
- Hmm.
- Yep.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.975
Wow!

16:58.142 --> 17:00.110
I see the problem right here.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.526
You bought Japanese.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.281
Guilty.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.570
Next time buy American.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.451
- Yep.
- It's my, uh, sister's car.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.040
- Uh-huh.
- I just drive it.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.298
Yeah well, you tell your sister

17:20.455 --> 17:23.084
next time she should
buy American.

Hey, Dawn?

20:20.845 --> 20:22.313
Yeah?

20:22.471 --> 20:24.439
Does this feel funny to you?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.942
No. Why?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.859
I don't know.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.779
Just that we're
40 miles from town.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.410
I wouldn't worry about it, Kara.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.074
What was the one good thing Mom used
to say to us when we were kids?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.790
Always make sure
he wears a condom?

20:45.828 --> 20:47.546
Oh no, wait.
Sorry, Kara.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.128
That was what she said
right after your dad left town.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.133
Oh whoops.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.920
That's what she should have said
to your dad when she met him.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.429
Oh ho ho!

20:58.048 --> 20:59.800
I'm serious.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.352
She said she wanted us
to trust in ourselves.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.107
Okay, so I'm trusting
in myself.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.272
And I don't know.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.908
I just-- I know something
doesn't feel right.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.153
Yeah.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.869
You know what?
I'm trusting in myself.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.205
And everything's telling me
that it is right.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.994
And I know

21:27.161 --> 21:29.914
Tes is a little tough,
but I need you to trust me.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.005
Can you do that?

21:41.759 --> 21:43.102
Yeah.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.308
Well, you know what?
That's all right, Kara,

21:45.471 --> 21:48.395
because you're probably just
overthinking things like you always do.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.901
- Are you joking?!
- No.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.654
I go along with every plan.
What's wrong with you?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.565
What? I have an opinion.
Is that the problem?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.200
Yeah, Kara, maybe that's the problem.
I wouldn't call it an opinion,

21:58.359 --> 21:59.986
but I think that might
be the problem.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.785
I'm just saying
try enjoying it a little.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.792
I am enjoying it.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.248
- A lot, actually.
- All right.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.289
Well, when you really start, let me know, I'll pull out
the video camera.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.878
Yeah, fuck you.
Fuck you.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.544
- What are you guys laughing at?
- Me apparently.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.633
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah? Why's that?

22:18.796 --> 22:21.265
Dawn doesn't think
that I can enjoy anything.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.175
- Can you?
- Really, you too?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.265
- What do you mean "really"?
- Why do you guys always

22:25.427 --> 22:26.974
- have to team up against me?
- Aww.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.265
- I'm the nicest person I know.
- Oh really?

22:29.431 --> 22:30.557
You guys are full of shit.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.692
Oh, we just pick on you
'cause you're little.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.354
Fuck you.
Look how big I am now.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.067
- Okay, shut up.
- You know what?

22:36.230 --> 22:38.653
I'm the boss, okay?
Everyone in here needs to shut up.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.236
So I'm guessing she runs the place.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.532
And there's no way that shit goes down
without her getting a piece of the pie.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.871
If anyone knows
anything, it's her.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.411
Okay, great.
Great, I'll take her.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.296
- Let's find out what she knows.
- I'll take the door.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.628
Guess I get the trucker.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.919
All right, I'm not even gonna say it 'cause you all
know what this is.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.929
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?

23:43.088 --> 23:45.807
Which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?

23:50.638 --> 23:52.561
Dawn!

24:00.564 --> 24:02.908
- Kara.
- Baby, please don't go ♪

24:03.067 --> 24:04.865
♪ Baby, please don't go... ♪

24:06.236 --> 24:08.204

24:12.284 --> 24:15.037
Mmm.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.582
I was gonna save it for later,

24:17.748 --> 24:19.295
but since your radio sucks,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.927
I got us some tunes.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.305
Lucky for you some of us
still live in the golden age.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.261
Yeah?
What age is the golden age?

24:26.423 --> 24:28.266
Oh, the '80s.
And not just the '80s,

24:28.425 --> 24:31.178
- but Bruce Willis in the '80s.
- No!

24:31.345 --> 24:32.767
- Oh yeah.
- Oh my God.

24:32.930 --> 24:36.059
Get ready for "Respect Yourself"
like you've never heard it before.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.069
Hey, Kara, even you might enjoy this.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.400
- Hmm?
- Little Bruce Willis.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.189
- Oh no.
- Kara, you gotta hear this too.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.279
- This is totally it.
- No, I'm not supporting this.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.658
- This isn't funny.
- Shh shh.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.196
Who even comes out with this shit?
I don't believe it.

24:48.362 --> 24:51.411
- No no no, girls, it's not funny.
- Come on, Kara, get some learning.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.325
Wow, you guys think
you're funny, don't you?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.165
- Oh yeah.
- Tes, take this shit out.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.421
Throw this shit out the window.
This is my car.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.206
Take the shit--

24:59.373 --> 25:01.467
- ♪ Come on, respect yourself... ♪
- Guys, ugh.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.969

You gotta be kidding me.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.433
Dawn, what's going on?

25:13.595 --> 25:16.314
- Shit.
- Fuck!

25:16.473 --> 25:18.441
- What does he want?
- Did you steal the tape?

25:18.600 --> 25:19.852
- No, of course not.
- I told you!

25:20.019 --> 25:21.987
- Kara, Kara! Come on.
- I told you. Did I not say it?

25:22.146 --> 25:24.240
- Pull it together. Just for now.
- Why don't you start listening to me?

25:24.398 --> 25:27.402
Shh! Just be cool.
Just fucking be cool, Kara.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.212
- Evening.
- Evening.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.060
How are you doing there,
beautiful?

25:55.095 --> 25:57.314
It's hot, ain't it?

25:57.473 --> 26:01.068
I can see you sweating over there,
but you just wear it so well.

26:02.686 --> 26:05.656
You're just as sweet
as a little daisy, ain't you?

26:12.362 --> 26:14.660
So where are y'all headed,
way out here this time of night?

26:14.823 --> 26:17.576
- Sorry?
- I said

26:17.743 --> 26:20.496
where are y'all headed,
way out here this time of night?

26:20.662 --> 26:23.085
Yeah, uh, we're just--
we're heading up to see some relatives.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.842
A sick relative out in Chaparral.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.379
- Chaparral?
- Yes sir.

26:28.545 --> 26:32.140
- A relative you say?
- Mm-hmm.

26:33.967 --> 26:34.843
All right then,

26:35.010 --> 26:37.308
on the count of three

26:37.471 --> 26:40.099
I want y'all to say
the name of the relative

26:40.265 --> 26:42.939
that you're going to visit
at the same time.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.688
One...

26:45.854 --> 26:48.983
two, three.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.243
Uncle Mel.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.706
I'm just fuckin' with y'all.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.795
Y'all didn't even have to answer that.

27:06.083 --> 27:10.338
No, seriously seriously seriously,
did it-- did it get you going?

27:10.504 --> 27:12.677
'Cause that shit--
that shit never gets old.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.058
Can I get your license
and your registration, please?

27:19.221 --> 27:20.689
Yeah. Um...

27:21.682 --> 27:24.936
Actually, you know what? Um,

27:25.102 --> 27:28.777
this is actually my brother's car,
so I don't have the registration.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.909
But think you could help a girl out?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.908
That's all right.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.496
We don't really get to do this
too much way out here anyway.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.458
- Can I ask why you pulled us over?
- Oh shit, I'm sorry.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.668
Your tire is low.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.507
I can't have you drivin' out here
with no air in your tire.

27:52.337 --> 27:55.716
You don't wanna be changing
a tire out here in this heat.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.386
Miss...

27:59.553 --> 28:02.272
Miss Samantha.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.149
Now you were saying gray men--

28:04.308 --> 28:06.481
That's right, Tom. The true friends

28:06.643 --> 28:08.941
- do not come from outer space.
- Here we go.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.278
I'm sorry, but from
the gray men beneath the bedrock.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.945
It's a hollow planet, Tom.
It's inside of earth.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.660
- It has to be.
- Well, you've got

28:18.822 --> 28:20.449
your Area 51 in Nevada.

28:20.616 --> 28:25.122
Well, I know that you've probably
not heard of Area 52.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.712
- Uh, I think I have.
- That's in Hoboken, isn't it?

28:28.874 --> 28:32.094
Mm-hmm.
- Right underneath New Jersey.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.559
Yeah.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.557
I'm taking two.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.351
Randy?

29:36.858 --> 29:38.906
Randy?

30:00.173 --> 30:01.641
Randy?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.677
Are you in there?

30:03.844 --> 30:06.563
You in there?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.895
Randy?

30:13.395 --> 30:14.942
Randy?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.818
Fuck.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.955
Fuck me.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.621
Elmore, pick up.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.956
Hey, Elmore, pick up.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.290
Elmore, it's an emergency.
Pick up.

30:35.292 --> 30:38.546
We got a 10-27
down at Randy's stop.

30:38.712 --> 30:41.135
Elmore, pick up.
Randy's been shot!

30:41.298 --> 30:43.392
Fuck me.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.178
Yeah, boy, I'm telling you,
this heat out here,

30:46.345 --> 30:48.643
it'll kill you. And me,

30:48.805 --> 30:50.682
I just-- I just wouldn't wanna

30:50.849 --> 30:52.351
have y'all dying out here

30:52.517 --> 30:55.771
and me having to call your mamas
and give them the tragic news.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.031
Yep, no no, we wouldn't
want that either, Officer.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.818
- Thank you.
- Cuidado.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.868
Cui-da-do.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.124
You gotta be careful out here.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.751
Now there's a truck stop
just up the way.

31:09.910 --> 31:13.460
I think y'all need to pull in there and
get yourself some air in these tires.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.750
Yeah, great, will do.
Thanks, Officer. Sounds good.

31:15.916 --> 31:18.840
In fact, I can follow behind y'all

31:19.002 --> 31:20.925
and make sure that
you get there in one piece.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.716
No, we're fine, Officer.
Thank you very much.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.008
- We got it.
- Mm-hmm.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.803
Come on now, come on.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.516
You ain't got to call me officer.

31:31.014 --> 31:32.641
You can call me Elmore.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.937
- Well, Elmore, uh--
- That's my name.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.572
Elmore.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.903
Elmore Huggin.

31:41.066 --> 31:44.866
As in "you hug me,
I hug you"--

31:45.028 --> 31:47.952
it's a regular "hug in."

31:49.324 --> 31:51.076
- You get it?
- Mm-hmm.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.087
Elmore--
Elmore Hug-ins.

31:55.497 --> 31:57.591
I just crack myself up.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.136
- Huh?
- Yes.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.843
- It's funny.
- In fact,

32:04.005 --> 32:07.134
you know what I'm gonna do?
I can turn on them blue and reds

32:07.300 --> 32:09.268
and I can escort y'all if you want to.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.725
No!

32:10.887 --> 32:14.642
No, really.
Just following behind us would be fine.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.027
- Are you sure about that?
- Yeah.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.233
It could be fun though.
It could be fun.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.023
Yeah.
Bet it could be a lot of fun,

32:21.189 --> 32:23.442
but, you know, we're really fine.
But thank you so much.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.861
All right.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.866
You're the boss.

32:31.032 --> 32:34.127
You ladies,
now you be safe now.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.340
Great.
Thank you, Officer!

32:42.252 --> 32:44.346
What the fuck
was that all about?

32:44.504 --> 32:46.051
Don't ask me.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.319
This is it?

35:08.481 --> 35:12.076
This is the big exchange point?
Are you kidding?

35:13.486 --> 35:16.239
Tes, why are there cars here?
I thought you said this place was empty.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.033
- Have I been here before?
- Yeah, Kara,

35:18.199 --> 35:19.951
it's probably the late night rush.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.167
- Tes, are you sure?
- What is with the 20 questions?

35:23.330 --> 35:26.630
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Hey, relax.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.885
Relax.
I was just asking.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.923
I am relaxed.
I'm very fucking relaxed.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.725
Dude, don't get mad at me, all right?
This wasn't my fucking idea.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.636
Genius.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.476
What do you want from me, huh?

35:40.639 --> 35:43.313
- I don't know right now.
- No no no, I think you do.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.149
Tell me,
what do you want from me?

35:47.354 --> 35:49.197
I want you to acknowledge

35:49.356 --> 35:52.906
that it's a little strange that Mel would even give us
another job

35:53.068 --> 35:55.116
after how bad
we fucked up the last one.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.781
Okay?
And this is where he sends us?

35:57.947 --> 36:01.952
I mean, call me crazy--
this doesn't feel weird to you?

36:02.118 --> 36:05.042
- Dawn?
- Why do you do that?

36:05.205 --> 36:07.378
- What? What am I doing?
- That--

36:07.540 --> 36:09.133
questioning.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.136
How long have we
been doing this for?

36:13.421 --> 36:15.423
- How long?
- Are you serious?

36:15.590 --> 36:18.184
Yeah. And how many times
has Mel ever steered us wrong?

36:19.219 --> 36:21.472
How many, Kara?

36:24.057 --> 36:25.980
- None.
- Right, none.

36:26.142 --> 36:29.863
So what are you
so worried about? What?

36:30.021 --> 36:32.649
Look around, Kara.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.114
There's nobody.
No witnesses.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.120
It's like the easiest job
we'll ever do. All right?

36:38.279 --> 36:41.158
In fact, it's probably why
Mel sent us here--

36:41.324 --> 36:43.201
so we can get our shit
back together.

36:43.368 --> 36:45.621
Think about it.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.428
Hey, is Mel fucking you yet?

36:55.505 --> 36:57.223
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

36:57.382 --> 36:59.976
- Yeah, fuck you for saying that.
- Fuck you, Tes...

37:00.135 --> 37:01.853
- Fuck you!
- ...for bringing me all the way

37:02.011 --> 37:03.433
out here and never
fucking listening.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.975
Chill, both of you!
Chill.

37:12.105 --> 37:15.029
I don't even know what you guys
are fighting about any more,

37:15.191 --> 37:17.285
but every time
it's like fucking World War III.

37:19.738 --> 37:23.117
I don't care what it is.
We have a job to do,

37:23.283 --> 37:26.207
so not one of us is leaving this car

37:26.369 --> 37:28.997
until we are all fucking calm.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.153
All right.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.111
So there are these four nuns.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.243
They're sitting outside
of the confessional.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.778
The first nun goes in,

37:59.944 --> 38:02.447
and she says "Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned."

38:02.614 --> 38:05.333
And the Father goes,
"How have you sinned?"

38:05.492 --> 38:08.962
She says, "I'm so sorry, Father,
I looked at a man's penis."

38:09.120 --> 38:12.374
The Father says, "Ahhh,
that's terrible. I want you to say

38:12.540 --> 38:15.544
10 Hail Marys and go out and wash
your eyes with holy water."

38:15.710 --> 38:19.510
So the nun says "Yes."
She walks out, says her 10 Hail Marys,

38:19.672 --> 38:22.721
up to that basin and washes
her eyes out with holy water.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.309
Second nun goes in, says "I'm so sorry,
Father, I have sinned. Forgive me."

38:26.471 --> 38:29.099
The Father says
"How? How have you sinned?"

38:29.265 --> 38:33.020
She said
"I touched a man's penis."

38:34.479 --> 38:37.028
So the Father goes "Ugh,
that's even worse than the last one."

38:37.190 --> 38:41.115
"I want you to go say 20 Hail Marys
and wash your hands with holy water."

38:41.277 --> 38:44.281
So the nun steps out,
she does her Hail Marys

38:44.447 --> 38:46.370
and washes her hands
with holy water.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.285
Suddenly there's a commotion.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.704
And the priest comes out,
he's like "Whoa, what's going on?"

38:50.870 --> 38:53.623
Because the two sisters--
like three and four are fighting.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.168
He's like, "Yo yo yo, Sisters,

38:56.334 --> 38:58.302
what happened?
What's going on?"

38:58.461 --> 39:01.385
Fourth nun, who's been
eavesdropping, steps out and says,

39:01.548 --> 39:05.052
"I don't care what you say, Father.
I am not washing my mouth

39:05.218 --> 39:07.312
in that water
after she sits in it."

39:10.306 --> 39:12.308
Wow.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.068
Nice one, Dawn.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.650
- Dawn, you're retarded.
- You really just told that joke?

39:16.813 --> 39:19.657
I like that joke.
My daddy taught me that joke.

39:19.816 --> 39:22.069
That's even worse.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.947
Right.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.529
So I'm guessing
she runs the place.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.366
And there's no way this shit
goes down here

40:05.528 --> 40:07.496
without her getting
a piece of the pie.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.578
If anyone
knows anything, it's her.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.540
Okay, great. I'll take her.
Let's find out what she knows.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.289
- I'll take the door.
- Guess I got the trucker.

40:16.456 --> 40:19.585
All right, I'm not even gonna say it
'cause you all know what this is.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.595
- You be cool, Billy Bob.
- Who drives the truck and where is it?

40:22.754 --> 40:25.473
Which one of you shitkickers
knows where the fucking truck is?

40:31.471 --> 40:33.439
Dawn!

40:57.246 --> 40:59.248
Drop the gun.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.964
Drop the fucking gun!
Put the gun on the floor

41:02.126 --> 41:05.300
or I'm gonna put your fucking brains
all over that fucking table. Do it!

41:06.798 --> 41:08.641
I'm not gonna ask you again!

41:10.510 --> 41:12.262
You got three seconds to put it down
or I'm gonna put you down

41:12.428 --> 41:13.930
like fucking Thelma ands Louise there!
Three.

41:14.097 --> 41:16.191
Shut up!

41:16.349 --> 41:20.195
Two.
Listen, Jesse Jane,

41:20.353 --> 41:22.572
this ain't "Jeopardy."
You don't get a fucking option here.

41:22.730 --> 41:25.950
Your only option is
to put down the fucking gun!

41:27.485 --> 41:29.579
- Eh, fuck it.
- No no no no no!

41:29.737 --> 41:32.536
- You put your gun down.
- Fuck you. I'm not dropping shit.

41:33.783 --> 41:36.286
All right, obviously--
obviously none of us

41:36.452 --> 41:38.625
are gonna drop
our guns, so let's just--

41:38.788 --> 41:40.506
- let's just talk about it.
- Huh?

41:40.665 --> 41:42.759
You wanna fuckin' talk?
This ain't fuckin' couples therapy.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.386
The only one talking here is me and I'm telling you
to drop the fucking gun!

41:45.545 --> 41:48.014
I know! All right, all right,
listen-- listen to me!

41:48.172 --> 41:50.470
We'll both just put our guns down
at the same time.

41:53.302 --> 41:56.522
Would you shut her up?!
Jesus.

41:56.681 --> 41:59.981
See, I don't think you understand
what's going here fully. Okay?

42:00.143 --> 42:01.690
If you had any sense left--

42:01.853 --> 42:03.855
and I'm bettin' big on you, baby,
right now that you do--

42:04.022 --> 42:06.525
I think you'd put that down before Mel gets here and
fuckin' blows us both--

42:06.691 --> 42:08.568
- Mel?
- Yeah, Mel.

42:08.735 --> 42:12.330
Big guy, blue suit,
always has fuckin' pecans.

42:14.073 --> 42:17.794
Oh. Oh oh oh oh oh.

42:17.952 --> 42:21.081
Oh, that's right.
You don't know shit, do you?

42:21.247 --> 42:23.466
You know why? Because I'm
in fuckin' control of the situation--

42:23.624 --> 42:27.424
- How the fuck do you know Mel?
- Oh, me and Mel, we go way back, baby.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.555
- What?
- That's right.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.637
That gravy train that you've been on,
it's over, so you might as well

42:31.799 --> 42:34.268
give up now because there's no way
that you're walking out of here.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.771
What about the fucking dope?
What about the dope and the money?

42:36.929 --> 42:39.523
Dope? What dope?
There's no fucking dope!

42:41.684 --> 42:43.561
it's the-- the fucking money?

42:43.728 --> 42:45.605
The only thing I know about money
is our mutual buddy Mel

42:45.772 --> 42:48.366
- pays pretty fucking good.
- Mel wouldn't do that to me.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.243
Mel wouldn't do that to me. Mel wouldn't fucking do
that to me, all right?

42:51.402 --> 42:56.033
- You're lying!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut her up!

42:56.199 --> 42:58.201
Mel wouldn't do that?

42:58.367 --> 43:00.961
I bet he told you that someone
was infringing on his corridor,

43:01.120 --> 43:04.090
is that right? That the story?
That the one you got? Hmm?

43:04.248 --> 43:06.967
And he sent you here to fucking
figure out who was. Is that it?

43:07.126 --> 43:09.345
Is that gettin' close?

43:09.504 --> 43:11.131
Are you out of your fucking mind?

43:11.297 --> 43:14.551
You think someone's actually running their own
shipment along Mel's route?

43:14.717 --> 43:18.438
You think he doesn't know
what's going down here 24 fucking 7?

43:18.596 --> 43:21.520
That someone's got the balls
to step up in his shit?

43:21.682 --> 43:24.185
And you think that
if something were going on,

43:24.352 --> 43:26.571
you think he'd send
you three fucking bimbos

43:26.729 --> 43:29.357
here to figure out who it was?

43:32.610 --> 43:34.988
I mean, even I'm not that stupid...

43:35.154 --> 43:36.952
and I never even got
through high school!

43:39.617 --> 43:41.369
You're slipping.

43:43.246 --> 43:45.715
- You're getting sloppy, Billy.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

43:45.873 --> 43:48.467
What the fuck are you doin'
wearing a cop uniform for?

43:48.626 --> 43:53.052
The more prevalent question is
what the hell are you doing here?

43:53.214 --> 43:55.592
- Why isn't everything taken care of?
- What?

43:55.758 --> 43:58.352
What the fuck you care?
You're not in on this.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.730
I care because
it's a hot fucking night

44:00.888 --> 44:03.391
and I've been roasting outside
for over an hour

44:03.558 --> 44:05.856
and all your dumb ass
managed to do was this.

44:06.018 --> 44:09.568
Dumb ass? Fuck you!!
Shit got out of hand!

44:09.730 --> 44:12.404
These two Midwest tourist
motherfuckers wouldn't leave

44:12.567 --> 44:14.490
and this fucking cunt here
and her two dead sisters

44:14.652 --> 44:17.576
decided to shoot up the joint!
I didn't plan for this shit!

44:17.738 --> 44:19.957
Well, aren't you lucky
that I showed up then, huh?

44:20.116 --> 44:22.539
Yeah. So quit standing there with your thumb up
your ass and help me out here!

44:22.702 --> 44:25.125
- This bitch is volatile!
- Calm down! Just calm down.

44:25.288 --> 44:27.507
Now would somebody walk me through what
happened here, please?

44:27.665 --> 44:29.759
- They shot us.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

44:29.917 --> 44:31.840
- They shot us and they shot my friends!
- Uh-- they?!

44:32.003 --> 44:33.175
They shot-- they shot us!

44:33.337 --> 44:34.714
You're the ones who decided
to go all "Boogie Nights"

44:34.881 --> 44:37.009
and fuckin' shoot up the joint,
set off a nuclear fucking bomb in here!

44:37.175 --> 44:40.554
They fuckin' shot Francine, Ronny.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.143
- They fuckin' shot her!
- Oh, that's sad.

44:43.306 --> 44:47.527
Ronny, tell this chick what the fuck's going on with
Mel and everything,

44:47.685 --> 44:49.779
- all right? Help me out here.
- I'll get to that.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.985
Why is he calling you Ronny?

44:52.148 --> 44:54.571
I thought you said
your name was Elmore.

44:54.734 --> 44:58.204
Why don't both of you just--
just put your guns down

44:58.362 --> 45:00.615
before you two kids
get hurt here, okay?

45:00.781 --> 45:02.454
Fuck you!
I'm gonna kill this fuckin' cunt.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.494
Hey, you calm down.
Ain't nobody gettin' killed right now.

45:04.660 --> 45:07.004
I am calm. Don't tell me to be calm.
I'm calm as a fucking kitten.

45:07.163 --> 45:10.212
You're sweating like a junkie
over there. You just calm the fuck down.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.503
- What the hell is going on?
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

45:13.669 --> 45:16.673
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Billy.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.558
Who are you? Who are you?

45:19.717 --> 45:22.186
Why aren't you doing something?

45:22.345 --> 45:24.347
Me?

45:24.513 --> 45:26.641
Shit, Tes,

45:26.807 --> 45:30.437
you must have a lot of tears
clouding those eyes.

45:30.603 --> 45:32.776
Come on.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.831
You don't remember me?

45:43.199 --> 45:44.917
Come on.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.708
Come on!

45:48.746 --> 45:50.919
Come on!

45:53.584 --> 45:55.882
I am the delivery guy.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.473
Need anything else, honey?
You good?

46:07.932 --> 46:09.809
You all right, baby?

46:16.148 --> 46:19.778
♪ Damn, baby,
wanna get in on the action... ♪

46:19.944 --> 46:23.448
That's the first decent piece of ass
I've seen in this place all night.

46:23.614 --> 46:26.584
Tell me again, what the fuck
are we doing here, man?

46:26.742 --> 46:30.246
Just relax, B.
It picks up, I'm telling you, man.

46:30.413 --> 46:33.132
Later on this place will
be crawling with pussy.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.921
- Fuck, this beer tastes like piss, man.
- Yeah?

46:37.086 --> 46:40.181
This place smells like piss, all right?

46:40.339 --> 46:44.594
Why aren't we at Cabaret Club
or-- or 4 Play, Zebras?

46:44.760 --> 46:47.809
All right. Look around.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.684
Look at our competition.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.739
- What competition?
- Exactly.

46:56.897 --> 47:00.071
Any other place
we're just a number.

47:00.234 --> 47:03.113
- Here we get free fucking rein.
- Free fucking rein?

47:03.279 --> 47:06.749
Of what?
King of the ugly bitches?

47:06.907 --> 47:09.501
Seriously, I wouldn't fuck
any of these chicks with your dick.

47:09.660 --> 47:12.254
Davon, I'm getting herpes
by just looking at these chicks.

47:12.413 --> 47:14.791
Now I don't know what kind
of chicks you're nailing,

47:14.957 --> 47:17.301
but I've got a stack of hundreds
burning a hole in my back pocket,

47:17.460 --> 47:20.339
and I would rather let my pants
flambé my fucking cock off

47:20.504 --> 47:22.927
than pay any of these trailer rats
to get anywhere near my dick.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.717
I'm serious, fucker!

47:24.884 --> 47:26.682
You need to relax, man.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.687
I'm not sitting in some
putrid shithole just 'cause

47:28.846 --> 47:30.848
you don't feel like you're up
for a little competition, man.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.767
These bitches should be
paying me to be in here.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.027
- Oh boy.
- Finish that shit

47:35.186 --> 47:37.439
and let's get outta here.

47:37.605 --> 47:39.699
Anything else you boys want?

47:39.857 --> 47:41.825
Wow.

47:41.984 --> 47:45.659
All right, thank you, God. This is
what I'm talking about right here.

47:45.821 --> 47:48.244
- I told you this shit was legit, right?
- Whoo.

47:48.407 --> 47:50.785
Baby, where'd you come from, huh?

47:50.951 --> 47:53.045
Right over there actually.

47:54.914 --> 47:57.633
You got a sexy mouth on you.
I love that shit.

47:57.792 --> 48:01.638
Look, what do you say you get off work
early and we head out to my place?

48:01.796 --> 48:03.798
Third floor, The Fairfield.

48:03.964 --> 48:07.514
You know, I'd love that,
but I gotta work, honey.

48:07.676 --> 48:09.770
I'll make it worth your while.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.306
That's sweet,

48:11.472 --> 48:14.066
but unless you're gonna make it worth my while
every day, I've got a job to keep.

48:14.225 --> 48:17.274
She's got a point, B.
You know, make it worth her while, man.

48:19.563 --> 48:22.692
Fine. All right. Look,
why don't you give me your number

48:22.858 --> 48:24.986
and we can get together
after you're off, okay?

48:25.152 --> 48:26.950
I don't get off until 5:00.

48:27.113 --> 48:30.868
But, hey, how about you give me
your number and I'll call you, for sure.

48:33.202 --> 48:35.955
Playin' me like a bitch now, right?

48:36.122 --> 48:39.046
Look, do I look like a dumbass to you?

48:39.208 --> 48:42.052
No, you look like a good tipper.

48:42.211 --> 48:44.054
Tell you what,

48:44.213 --> 48:47.387
for one of those bills, I'll hook you up with Charlene
over there.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.803
She'll take care of you.

48:49.969 --> 48:53.690
She'll finish you off before you
can even say "cock-a-doodle-do."

48:53.848 --> 48:56.943
All right, fuck Charlene, okay?

48:57.101 --> 48:58.899
I want you.

48:59.061 --> 49:02.986
And I told you, I don't get off
until 5:00, so next time.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.275
Hey hey hey hey.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.694
Come on, come on.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.864
I think there's a little misunderstanding here, all
right?

49:09.029 --> 49:12.704
Come on, it's a simple question,
all right? How much is it gonna take?

49:12.867 --> 49:15.962
- Give him a number, he'll pay.
- Oh no, I understand.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.875
- Not for sale.
- Everything is for sale.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.338
It's just business, baby.

49:22.501 --> 49:25.095
Now look,
you're a smart girl, right?

49:25.254 --> 49:27.131
Just give me a number
and it's yours.

49:27.298 --> 49:30.518
Okay, you want a number...

49:30.676 --> 49:31.893
four.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.896
Four. 400?

49:35.055 --> 49:37.808
Inches. That's the size
requirement for this ride,

49:37.975 --> 49:40.444
and you're two inches
under the limit. Sorry.

49:40.603 --> 49:43.903
Hey look, bitch,
I don't know who you think you are,

49:44.064 --> 49:45.782
but this isn't
a multiple choice question.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.319
All right, now there's a simple answer and you're
going to give it to me.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.329
- Hey, man, what the-- ow!
- Hey, man, what the...?

49:50.488 --> 49:51.785
Take it easy, man.
He's only playing with her!

49:51.947 --> 49:53.995
You like questions?

49:55.868 --> 49:58.838
Because I have got
a multiple choice question for you.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.499
You can A) stay here,

50:01.665 --> 50:06.011
pretend like you enjoy getting
sodomized by George over there.

50:06.170 --> 50:08.138
You might like it.
Or B)...

50:08.297 --> 50:11.346
- Ow.
- ...you can keep mouthing off

50:11.509 --> 50:15.514
and get the record
for the quickest loss of your teeth,

50:15.679 --> 50:17.932
which I can make happen
to you for no charge.

50:18.098 --> 50:19.975
No charge!

50:20.142 --> 50:23.897
Or, or C)

50:24.063 --> 50:25.861
you can pick up your jacket,

50:26.023 --> 50:28.947
you and your boyfriend
can calmly walk out,

50:29.109 --> 50:32.204
drive away and never come
into this club again.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.661
- Now--
- Ow.

50:34.823 --> 50:36.996
Cuidado. Cuidado.

50:37.159 --> 50:39.958
I want you to think carefully

50:40.120 --> 50:43.294
because I want you
to make the right choice.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.254
- C, man!
- C, man.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.922
He's sayin' C.
You're gonna break his arm!

50:50.089 --> 50:51.682
Ay carajo!

50:53.133 --> 50:55.886
You want me to break his arm?
Do you want me to break his arm?

50:56.053 --> 50:56.929
No no no no!

50:57.096 --> 50:59.315
- I can break his arm if you want me to.
- No no no!

50:59.473 --> 51:01.100
- You sure?
- Ah!

51:02.142 --> 51:04.144
Let your friend answer.

51:04.311 --> 51:05.938
- Can your friend answer?
- Yes yes.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.528
- Answer.
- C, C!

51:08.691 --> 51:10.034
- C?
- Please.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.365
- "Si" as in yes?
- C, yes yes.

51:12.528 --> 51:13.745
- Or see, see?
- C.

51:13.904 --> 51:15.872
- C as in yes, I let you go?
- Please.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.123
- C?
- C-

51:17.283 --> 51:19.126
It's a good answer.

51:19.285 --> 51:22.084
It's a good answer.
I don't have to get bloody today.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.045
- I don't have to get bloody today.
- Yeah.

51:25.207 --> 51:28.086
Adios. Go. Vamonos.

51:29.169 --> 51:31.763
- Hey, fuck you, man!
- Let's get outta here.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.179
Wow. Thanks.

51:35.342 --> 51:37.060
I'm Jessica.

51:37.219 --> 51:40.063
Of course you are.
It's a beautiful name.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.771
The guy--

51:42.933 --> 51:45.652
was he worth it?

51:45.811 --> 51:48.030
What?

51:48.188 --> 51:50.111
You know what.
Come on.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.868
Come on, come on.

51:53.027 --> 51:55.826
You know what.

51:55.988 --> 51:57.490
Come on.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.917
Hmph.

52:08.083 --> 52:11.178
20 bucks...

52:13.047 --> 52:14.845
an old condom...

52:17.593 --> 52:20.688
a punch card for helado latte.

52:20.846 --> 52:23.941
Fucking maricon.
He can't even drink espresso.

52:26.268 --> 52:28.191
...Amex card.

52:28.354 --> 52:32.075
Coño, it's a great haul.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.075
You really cleaned up
on this one.

52:34.234 --> 52:37.078
What are you, a cop?

52:37.237 --> 52:39.114
No. Not quite.

52:39.281 --> 52:42.000
Huh.
Well, that's too bad, isn't it?

52:42.159 --> 52:44.912
A girl really likes
a man in uniform.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.173
And I'm sure that

52:47.331 --> 52:50.175
men in uniform,
they like you too.

52:50.334 --> 52:53.964
You know you are
much too special to be here.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.881
- Hmm.
- Huh?

52:56.048 --> 52:57.345
Tell my boss that.

52:57.508 --> 53:00.182
I don't need to talk to him.

53:01.804 --> 53:05.354
I have someone--
someone who wants to meet you.

53:07.434 --> 53:09.402
Come on.

53:10.437 --> 53:12.064
Come on.

53:53.188 --> 53:55.611
Wow, nice house.

53:55.774 --> 53:58.243
- It is.
- Yours?

53:58.402 --> 54:00.655
I am just the delivery guy.

54:00.821 --> 54:03.074
The gate is open, you just knock.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.038
- Okay.
- Hey!

54:05.200 --> 54:07.544
Hey. Don't forget me.

54:07.703 --> 54:11.583
And don't worry-- I will never
let anything happen to you.

54:13.041 --> 54:15.260
You will come out
as fresh as a daisy.

54:18.547 --> 54:20.515
I am for you!

54:22.176 --> 54:24.099
I am for you.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.263
I am hurt, Tes.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.850
I thought you told me
you love a man in uniform.

54:30.017 --> 54:32.395
That was two years ago.

54:32.561 --> 54:35.531
I saw you for
15 fucking minutes!

54:35.689 --> 54:37.783
Yes, but I remember you.

54:37.941 --> 54:40.945
You were always special to me.
But, hey...

54:41.111 --> 54:43.409
I won't hold it against you.

54:43.572 --> 54:46.121
Mel never did encourage
friendships amongst his staff.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.660
Right, Billy?

55:02.341 --> 55:04.469
You dumb dummy.
How many times I tell you?

55:04.635 --> 55:07.479
Don't open the door
to my house unless I open it!

55:07.638 --> 55:09.311
Hey, baby, how you doing?

55:09.473 --> 55:11.817
Good to see you.
You want a drink?

55:13.685 --> 55:15.858
Get in there and get me
some goddamn bourbon. Go on, git!

55:16.021 --> 55:18.444
Shut the-- shut the fuck up!

55:18.607 --> 55:21.611
I don't even understand you.
Hey, baby.

55:21.777 --> 55:22.778
Come on in.

55:24.238 --> 55:26.036
She's just fooling around a little bit.

55:26.198 --> 55:28.701
That's all. That's Darla.
She's a good friend of mine.

55:30.869 --> 55:33.042
Clean it up! Up!

55:34.039 --> 55:36.542
Nice tits, but-- ugh!

55:36.708 --> 55:39.507
Really, sit down anywhere.
Feel free.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.718
Not-- not--
wouldn't sit right there.

55:43.131 --> 55:45.099
We had a little party here
last night

55:45.259 --> 55:47.387
and there was
an accident in that chair.

55:47.553 --> 55:50.227
But sit anywhere else
besides that. Really.

55:50.389 --> 55:52.312
Oh.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.818
You know, I like pecans.

55:54.977 --> 55:57.071
I love pecans, really.
It's my favorite food.

55:57.229 --> 55:59.152
I don't think God
has made a better f--

55:59.314 --> 56:02.409
food than pecans.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.195
Thanks.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.864
My God, I like 'em.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.249
I mean that's just a--
what do you think?

56:10.242 --> 56:12.370
- I don't know.
- Allergies?

56:12.536 --> 56:14.379
- No.
- Not allergies?

56:15.914 --> 56:18.508
Well, in that case,
have some pecans.

56:20.002 --> 56:22.255
I'm just playing.
But I'm not.

56:22.421 --> 56:24.219
But I kinda am.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.804
I do like pecans.

56:29.469 --> 56:32.973
They reduce
your risk of gallstones.

56:33.974 --> 56:36.318
I should know.
I had one.

56:36.476 --> 56:39.355
Hurt like a motherfucker
right across here-- the abdomen.

56:42.566 --> 56:44.660
I had it sonically treated.

56:44.818 --> 56:48.038
Zapped it--

56:48.196 --> 56:50.574
no gallstone.

56:52.284 --> 56:54.833
Pete Rose had a gallstone.

56:56.330 --> 56:58.207
Weird, isn't it, to think
that Charlie Hussle

56:58.373 --> 57:01.126
- had the same gallstone that I have?
- Who is that?

57:01.293 --> 57:03.295
Not a baseball fan?

57:03.462 --> 57:05.055
Not really, no.

57:05.213 --> 57:07.557
I wouldn't call myself a fan.

57:07.716 --> 57:10.435
My mom used to take me
to some minor league games.

57:10.594 --> 57:12.847
- Your mom...
- Yeah, my mom.

57:13.013 --> 57:14.265
...Was a baseball fan?

57:14.431 --> 57:18.311
She, uh, she did it
for my brother really.

57:18.477 --> 57:20.445
Dad not a baseball fan?

57:20.604 --> 57:23.027
Not exactly.

57:28.737 --> 57:31.331
I do find you interesting.

57:31.490 --> 57:34.334
An interesting girl-- Tes.

57:34.493 --> 57:36.291
With one S.

57:36.453 --> 57:39.957
Wow, impressive.

57:40.123 --> 57:42.467
You officially know
everything about me.

57:42.626 --> 57:46.381
Well, I don't know
everything about you.

57:46.546 --> 57:48.469
And I'm not sure it's official.

57:48.632 --> 57:50.430
But yeah, I know some things.

57:50.592 --> 57:52.139
And how is that?

57:52.302 --> 57:55.897
I always try to find out
as much information as I can

57:56.056 --> 57:58.775
about the people I'm planning
on offering a job to.

57:58.934 --> 58:01.403
- A job?
- Mm-hmm.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.188
I already have a job.

58:03.355 --> 58:06.359
I work in a little shithole
down on Third and Caulson.

58:06.525 --> 58:08.823
- Yeah, I know that.
- It's a place called Spiro's.

58:08.986 --> 58:10.954
- I don't know if you know it.
- Spiro's?

58:11.113 --> 58:12.581
- A strip club. Yeah.
- It is a shithole.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.491
- A strip club.
- It's a dump.

58:14.658 --> 58:17.036
A dump, a dump.

58:17.202 --> 58:19.204
It's been dump
for a long time.

58:19.371 --> 58:21.715
I know it.
I own it.

58:23.208 --> 58:26.462
The reason I pulled you
out of that bullshit nightclub

58:26.628 --> 58:29.507
is because I thought that
what I had to offer you

58:29.673 --> 58:30.925
would be interesting,

58:31.091 --> 58:33.469
something that's better
than going to the bar,

58:33.635 --> 58:36.889
going down there
and talkin' to the local guys

58:37.055 --> 58:40.776
and lettin' them touch you
and just gettin' groped

58:40.934 --> 58:43.357
- every night for three bucks an hour.
- You know what? You got the wrong girl.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.943
- I don't do that. I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

58:46.106 --> 58:47.528
Neither do I.

58:47.691 --> 58:50.786
I serve drinks and I look cute.
That's it.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.663
You do both
those things really well.

58:56.408 --> 58:59.287
You also do something else
really well.

59:00.620 --> 59:03.840
You know
what I'm talking about?

59:15.302 --> 59:18.146
Do I look like a cop?

59:19.389 --> 59:22.393
If I was a cop, I would have turned
your dumb ass in by now.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.687
Shit,

59:24.853 --> 59:27.197
Ronny would have
done that by now.

59:27.355 --> 59:29.528
That was Ronny
out there, you know.

59:29.691 --> 59:32.695
Did he tell you his name?

59:33.862 --> 59:36.661
Yeah, probably not.
Anyway that's Ronny.

59:36.823 --> 59:39.576
But I do empathize

59:39.743 --> 59:42.087
with your problem.

59:43.663 --> 59:46.416
Who doesn't want money?
Who doesn't want it?

59:46.583 --> 59:48.836
Who doesn't need it?
Who doesn't have bills to pay?

59:49.002 --> 59:52.176
I empathize to the Nth degree.

59:53.548 --> 59:58.349
'Cause God knows it takes a special girl
that knows how to do what you do.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.641
Lifting wallets?

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:06.108
Yeah, that's a skill.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:15.070
I would say that you've
got some balls, woman.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.239
You've got some balls that clank

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:19.373
when you walk
down the street-- no offense.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.160
None taken.

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:25.248
I gotta get another drink.
I'll put a little bit more in there.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:28.166
Let me get you one too.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

And this is just business.

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:46.026
But for me, Tes,

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:50.860
this is the--
the business of my heart.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:53.195
Business of your heart?

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.366
The business of your heart?

You let us walk into this,
remember?

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:03.498
My friends are dead

What did you think was
going to happen?

collect your 401 K

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.511
and retire to Boca Raton?

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:20.681
You are a drug pusher, Tes.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.145

I'm a football girl.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.542
I like Roger Staubach.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:56.214
So don't sing me the goddamn
national anthem like I give a fuck.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:01.764
You think I was lifting those wallets just to jerk
myself off?

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.440
See, I'm just a simple girl
who appreciates a buck or two,

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.601
but that's not why
I lifted those wallets.

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:11.896
I did it 'cause I'm good at it.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:15.191
And fuck you
for not noticing sooner.

01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:19.403
So do me the goddamn courtesy

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.163
and stop talking to me
like I'm your fucking

date on prom night, all right?

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.584
Like I don't know what you do.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.166
Come on,
let's not waste any more time.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.752
I'm willing and able

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.758
because I can.

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:38.093
I marked you.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.721
Pecan?

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.400
I prefer walnuts.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:53.687
But I'll eat your fucking pecans
all day long,

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.355
Mel.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.904
Fuck.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.200
God damn, woman.

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.622
Congratulations.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.007
Come on.

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.927
Take a walk outside.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:21.089
What do you know about coke?

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.052
Do you think you can bungle

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:28.142
$2 million worth of coke
and just walk away?

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.602
This last job,
it was your last.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.692
You never answered
the question, Ronny.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:39.108
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.402
You know,

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:44.742
I am glad you asked that.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.826
Actually, Billy,

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.837
I am going to need you
to hand over the money.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.794
All of it.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:57.800
What the fuck are you talking about?
What are you doing, Ronny?

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.802
Don't make this difficult, Billy.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:01.634
Now there is an easy way

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:04.094
and there is a hard way

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.510
- and I will let you choose.
- Fuck you!

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.349
Fuck me?

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.104
No fuck you!

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:13.858
What the fuck, Ronny?
What the fuck are you doing?

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.270
I told you--
you can either do this

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:18.438
the easy way or the hard way.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.733
And apparently
you are choosing the latter.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.778
I didn't choose shit, Ronny!
Take your fucking gun off of me.

01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.570
You have some dignity, Billy.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:27.739
You are screaming
like a fucking schoolgirl.

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:30.284
Now I am getting mine,

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.203
and you're going to get it
and that's all there is to it.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.589
'Cause I am done, Billy.
I am done.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.795
What about the cop?
You shot a fucking cop, Ronny.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.551
I didn't shoot the cop.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.712
- You shot the cop.
- Me?

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.598
What the fuck you talking about?
I didn't shoot no cop!

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:47.851
You're fucking delusional, Ronny!

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:50.603
You think I expected you
to just hand over the money?

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:52.264
What about Mel?
What are you going to tell Mel?

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.727
That you shot me over the money

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.018
he paid me to get rid
of these fucking bitches?

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.687
- You let me worry about Mel.
- What's he talking about, Ronny?

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.355
What do you mean
"What is he talking about"?

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.866
It's just a setup.
Open your fucking eyes!

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.822
Can't you see the way he's acting?

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:06.611
He was gonna wait
for you three bitches to be dead

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:08.451
and then he was
gonna waltz in here

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.615
and he was gonna
shoot me for my money!

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:13.456
Which, by the way,
I don't fucking have!

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:16.792
You know you are half right--
half right.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.000
See, after you steal the money,

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:23.636
you die valiantly in a shoot-out
with the unlucky deputy outside

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:26.924
while trying to make
your daring escape.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.559
Then I take one
of these unlucky ladies,

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:32.186
throw her in the trunk,
take off and bang!

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.144
She disappears with the money
and is never heard from again.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:37.684
That's me and her, Ronny.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.899
What about you?
What the fuck you gonna do?

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.904
I was never here.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.987
Wait, I thought you said there
wasn't any money. What money?

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.949
The money Mel paid him
to get rid of you three.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.455
I told you it's not here.
I don't have it!

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.914
Ronny, it's me Billy.

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:58.045
Why don't you put your gun down

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:02.129
and let's kill this fucking chick
and let's get outta here together?

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.171
That is not going to happen.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.590
I was planning on leaving myself,

01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:12.431
but now that we are involved
in this little pickle,

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:15.814
I'm going to have
to take Tes with me.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.816
Her? Come on, Ronny.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.774
I'll-- I'll give you Jesse's half.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:23.483
I'll give you all of it!

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.240
I thought you said
the money wasn't here.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:28.117
- Where is it?
- No, it isn't here.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:31.405
There's no cake here.
I'll give it to you when I get it.

01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:34.074
You know Mel. Mel doesn't let
anybody handle the cash.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.787
You of all people
should know that!

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.078
- You are lying, Billy.
- Lying?

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.588
I'm the only one here
who's on the level, Ronny!

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.421
I don't think so.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.649
- I saw you.
- I saw the money.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.688
Oh come on, Ronny.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.949
That wasn't our fucking money.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:10.530
What was it then?

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:13.788
It was this-- the tools!

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:15.164
- The guns!
- Wait a minute.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:17.701
Why is Mel doing this?

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.416
I don't know why
you are so confused.

01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.831
You know the policy.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:25.170
Policy? What policy?

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:29.088
Do you think that Mel
gives two shits about you?

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.929
He is not there
for you like I am.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.469
I have always
been there for you.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.763
But Mel?

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:40.808
No strikes.
You fuck up once,

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.897
you are done!

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.606
Isn't that right, Billy?

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.360
He has always done this.

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:50.901
He is-- he is paranoid.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.786
You remember that--
that chick he told you about?

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.664
The one that
went on vacation?

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:30.152
Welcome to Cancun.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.067
And in case the pieces
are a little foggy,

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.953
this is why Billy is here.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:39.082
And this how I fucked up.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.665
I wasn't there to protect you
like every other job.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:46.046
I've been there for you
every time-- every time.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:49.084
But this one time,
this last time...

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.970
if I had have been there,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.471
What are you talking about?

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.599
You're fucked, Ronny.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:59.136
Your stupid fucking plan
is flawed.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.270
This chick
doesn't even know you.

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.430
Know me?

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:06.818
What the fuck
do you know about love?

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:13.233
Tes, I know you see it.

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:16.823
I saw it in your eyes in the club.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:21.666
What?
What did you see in my eyes?

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.577
You can't tell me
that it wasn't there.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.837
I saw it. It was there.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.840
- There's nothing there.
- There's nothing there.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:32.001
You know you are getting
on my fucking nerves, Billy.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.216
You think Mel's
gonna stand for this?

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:36.676
And you think in your wildest
fucking delusions

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.136
- this bitch is even interested in you?
- Bitch?

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.223
You're going to treat
this woman with respect.

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:44.765
If you call her a bitch again...

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:49.027
I will shoot you dead.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:53.359
Now Mel is the reason
why I'm here.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:56.905
He is becoming careless.

01:09:57.068 --> 01:09:59.446
He's becoming senile.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.286
All he does
is crack pecans all day.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.200
That's why I'm retiring.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.086
I came here to collect my pension.

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:09.919
And now I'm going
to collect my girl.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.004
Your girl?

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.965
I'm not your girl.
I'm not your fucking girl!

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:18.132
This mess is because of you!
You understand?

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:21.016
This is not because of Mel.
Mel wouldn't do this!

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.428
I'm so glad you are
such an expert on Mel.

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:26.143
How many times have you talked
to him over the last--

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.103
three months?

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.644
Once?

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:33.154
I work with the guy every day.

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:36.065
- I know Mel.
- Yeah, I know Mel too, okay?

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.076
I know Mel. This is just--
this is all just a test.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.784
- It's a test.
- You think this is a big test?

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:44.574
Does that look like
a fucking joke to you?

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.618
We're all fucked!
Ronny!

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:50.129
Will you please shoot this girl
and let's get the fuck out of here?

01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:53.258
I'm not going to ask you again,
Billy, to calm down.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.295
Fuck you, Ronny!

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.304
You know what?

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:06.805
Since you are being
such a brave girl,

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.895
and Billy here is-is--

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:12.856
a whiny little bitch,
I'm going to make a deal with you.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:17.236
You don't have to tell me
yes or no.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.160
You just have to show me.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.118
I want you to shoot him

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.500
and then we will
walk away together

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:30.878
- and disappear.
- Don't listen to him.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.673
But if you don't,

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.086
I'm going to have to--

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.220
I will have to shoot you both.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.507
He's full of shit.

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:46.018
He'll shoot you before you even get
a shot off once I'm fucking dead.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.271
Look at what he's doing--
he's double-crossing Mel,

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.102
now he's double-crossing us.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:52.483
You don't want to end up
like your friends here.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.815
I'm telling you,
he's a fucking liar!

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:57.071
He's gonna fuck you
like he's fucked all of us.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.574
He's gonna shoot us
and he's gonna take the money.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.360
Will you shut the fuck up, Billy,
and-and-- and let--

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:04.746
let the girl think, for fuck's sake?

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.123
Let her make
her own decision.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:09.534
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.170
I came in here freely
of my own accord, didn't I?

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.752
- Liar.
- I could have--

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:19.715
I could have did you both quickly
like I did them, but I didn't.

01:12:19.877 --> 01:12:22.221
He thought he could walk
in here and put a couple in us,

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.724
but he's stuck!
You're stuck, Ronny.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.929
Tes...

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.279
marry me?

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:41.858
I love you.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:47.743
I'm telling you,
he's on the fucking insane train.

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.327
You're going to have
to shoot him now.

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:56.631
- You're a fucking psychopath!
- Make your decision.

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:59.042
Don't do it.
He's insane.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.462
- Two, one.
- Don't.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.005
Shoot him.

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.924
Don't fucking--

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:09.389
Shoot him.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.520
- You can do it. Shoot him.
- Don't.

01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:22.274
I am so sad

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.817
that you make this decision.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.987
We could have worked.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:31.040
- I am sorry, Tes.
- No no! Wait! I'll do it! I'll do it!

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:34.202
I'll do it. I'll kill him.
I'll kill him. I'll shoot him.

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:37.459
This is great.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.296
- I knew that you...
- Don't--

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.960
...you would make
the right decision.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:43.503
--Fucking shoot me.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:49.134
Don't shoot me.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.302
There is no money.

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:54.473
Ronny,
there's no fucking money!

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:55.765
Don't shoot me!

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.229
You need me to do
the countdown again?

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.439
- Don't-- listen--
- Three.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:02.071
- No, don't fucking shoot me!
- Two.

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.482

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.762
It'll make you feel better.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.315
I am...

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.568
done.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:50.611
I am

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:52.491
done.

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:57.405
Don't even know who
the fuck I am any more.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:17:00.745
I don't know who the hell
the fuck I am.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:06.505
I'm gonna tell you
a little story, Ronny,

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:08.962
a parable.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.670
You know what a parable is, right?
Like out of the Bible.

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:16.216
- Yeah.
- A long time ago,

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:20.432
these cowboys and Indians
were involved in a big fight.

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:23.473
American Indians--
pre-casino, big fight.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.188
Big fight-- arrows, bullets.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.024
You know how it goes.

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:32.983
One of these cowboys--

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.743
let's call him Bucky--

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:38.279
Bucky gets himself captured
by one of the Indians--

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:40.618
not just any Indian,
the big Indian.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:44.786
Big world-famous fucking Indian,
Chief Running Bear.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:48.126
So Bucky thinks he's fucked.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:51.213
Thinks his life is over,
he's gonna be killed.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:55.221
But Running Bear, instead of killing him, he takes
him back to the tribe.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:59.509
And he forgets all about
being a cowboy.

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:03.683
He forgets all his cowboy ways.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:07.441
Old Bucky couldn't want
for nothing.

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:11.396
As you can imagine,
him and Running Bear

01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:14.566
got very close.
Very close.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:17.736
Running Bear makes
Bucky his consigliere.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:20.997
Bucky makes...

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.249
heavy wampum.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.830
Heavy wampum.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.796
You know what happens next?

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:33.551
He makes a mistake.

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:40.011
- He just started to get restless.
- Okay.

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:42.347
- He didn't have enough.
- No no.

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:47.850
He starts forgetting everything
that Running Bear had done for him.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.228
He looks at Running Bear and he
goes "Look at this motherfucker.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.647
He's drinking
too much firewater,

01:18:54.813 --> 01:18:56.986
smoking too much
peace pipe.

01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:59.743
I can do it better than him."

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:03.281
He just says "Fuck it."

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.786
Then he starts fucking
Running Bear.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.999
And he fucks him.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:17.424
And not no "Brokeback Mountain"
kind of fucking.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.889
You following me, Ronny?

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.937
The moment that he starts
to fuck Running Bear,

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.227
he loses somethin'.

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:34.862
Do you know what he lost?

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:39.658
He lost fuckin' respect for him.

01:19:39.817 --> 01:19:42.195
Respect.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:45.991
Right.
He's looking at lost respect.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:50.502
In that moment

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.255
the cowboy loses everything.

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:57.715
He lost the thing
that was most important to him.

01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:00.629
And for what?

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.424
For what, Ronny?

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:08.892
So he could steal
a couple more furs?

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:16.145
All I needed was to have
something for myself, Mel...

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:20.615
something that would
let me know who I was.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.574
I've been working with you
seven years.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:27.240
Seven years.

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.123
I always liked you.

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:35.836
I always looked after you.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.711
But I never trusted you.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:43.097
Trust doesn't exist in this world,
does it, Mel?

01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:46.138
No. It does not.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.850
It does not.
I know you've been stealin'.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:55.147
Was this, like, some kind
of goodbye present?

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:57.653
All this?

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.401
Well, Running Bear,

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.160
he had a heart...

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:07.367
Ol'\C6.

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.659
He had mercy.

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:14.078
He understood mercy once.

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:19.000
Can he set the cowboy free

01:21:19.166 --> 01:21:21.965
in the desert

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.846
all alone?

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:29.593
How the fuck
would Running Bear do that?

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.809
Set the cowboy free?

01:21:37.684 --> 01:21:40.813
Well, I don't think
that's going to happen.

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.653
He sets the cowboy free,
he knows that eventually

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.743
someday that cowboy's gonna
come back and start fuckin' him again.

01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:55.666

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:58.251

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.837

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:03.502
maybe I made a mistake,

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:06.013
maybe I was desperate,

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:10.176
just trying to get something to feel,
you know, anything anything.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:12.936
But I ain't going back
to the way I was.

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:15.143
Ain't going back to the way I was.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.228

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.439
I wouldn't send you back.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:22.320
You know why?

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:25.983

was there?
