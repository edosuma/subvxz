WEBVTT

00:02.569 --> 00:04.594
...and since l was
the only crew member

00:04.704 --> 00:07.172
who could survive
the corrosive atmosphere,

00:07.273 --> 00:09.741
it was up to me
to retrieve the data module

00:09.843 --> 00:11.310
and save the day.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.077
Ah, here l am...

00:15.148 --> 00:16.706
mission accomplished.

00:16.783 --> 00:17.807
Ah...

00:17.884 --> 00:19.579
Then, of course there was

00:19.652 --> 00:21.483
the perilous mission
to La'voti V.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.317
You remember that one,
don't you, Mr. Paris?

00:23.390 --> 00:25.756
How could l forget?

00:25.825 --> 00:29.386
Here you are
after your unfortunate slip

00:29.462 --> 00:32.659
into the fetid mud pits
of Pala Mar.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.298
Hey, l was pushed.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.369
Of course you were.

00:36.469 --> 00:37.868
Thank you, Doctor.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.871
We've all enjoyed
your holo-images enormously.

00:39.939 --> 00:41.566
Oh, but l haven't
finished yet.

00:41.674 --> 00:42.732
There's more?

00:42.842 --> 00:44.002
The best is yet to come,
Lieutenant.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.135
l've created a fascinating

00:46.212 --> 00:50.148
12-part holographic essay
which l call ''Under the Skin:

00:50.216 --> 00:52.150
Humanoid Anatomy as Art.''

00:52.218 --> 00:55.415
Let's begin
with this stunning magnification

00:55.488 --> 00:58.013
of the Vulcan
reproductive gland.

00:58.091 --> 01:00.082
Note the composition.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.129
The subtle variations in color.

01:05.932 --> 01:06.899
2100 hours, Commander.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.534
All systems reporting normal.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.125
Acknowledged.

01:12.172 --> 01:14.663
Like l said, it's 2100 hours.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.105
l heard you the first time,
Harry.

01:16.176 --> 01:18.701
They've been in there
over an hour.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.939
l'm aware of that.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.606
Didn't the Captain ask you
to rescue them after 30 minutes?

01:23.683 --> 01:25.651
Harry, you and l
were lucky enough

01:25.718 --> 01:28.414
to enjoy the Doctor's
scintillating exhibition

01:28.488 --> 01:29.955
for two full hours.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.457
Would it really be fair of us
to deny our friends

01:32.525 --> 01:34.186
the same
unforgettable experience?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.728
Of course not, sir.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.127
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.897
We'll do it again soon.

01:45.004 --> 01:48.167
We've still got thousands
of light-years to while away.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.936
This could be a weekly event.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.943
What happened to going
to Yellow Alert

01:52.011 --> 01:52.978
after half an hour?

01:53.146 --> 01:55.376
Commander Chakotay appears to
have disobeyed a direct order.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.348
Definitely grounds
for court-martial.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.681
Hey, Neelix.

02:02.755 --> 02:03.687
Coffee?

02:03.756 --> 02:05.383
l could use a whole pot.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.891
Let me guess.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.090
The Doctor's photographic essay?

02:11.164 --> 02:12.893
One mind-numbing image
after the next.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.263
Oh, l don't know.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.700
l thought some of those pictures
were pretty funny.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.397
You mean like the one where Tom
slipped into a mud pit?

02:20.840 --> 02:21.772
You're famous.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.308
Then, of course, there's the one

02:23.376 --> 02:24.900
depicting
a certain Chief Engineer

02:25.011 --> 02:26.945
with her foot stuck
in a plasma injector.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.105
What?

02:28.181 --> 02:30.274
Really? Well, l seem
to have missed that one.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.614
The Doctor must have taken it
out of the exhibition.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.346
Oh, l can't wait to
get my hands on it.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.945
Maybe l can distribute it
to everyone's personal database.

02:37.023 --> 02:38.650
Try it and l'll kill you...

02:38.725 --> 02:42.752
right after l finish deleting
the Doctor's program.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.855
What'd you put
in this coffee, Neelix?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.365
l'm reading
a massive energy wave

02:51.471 --> 02:53.302
900,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow,

02:53.373 --> 02:54.340
heading right for us.

02:54.407 --> 02:55.465
Source?

02:55.575 --> 02:56.667
Unknown.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.142
Shields up.
Evasive maneuvers.

02:59.479 --> 03:00.741
The wave just changed course.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.110
lt seems to be tracking us!

03:02.182 --> 03:03.149
Go to warp 8.

03:03.216 --> 03:04.877
Too late.
Engines are down.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.508
Everybody hang on.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:04.070 --> 05:05.264
All stop.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.303
Shields are holding.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.840
Minor damage to the hull plating
on Deck 15.

05:09.008 --> 05:09.872
No injuries.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.340
Stand down Red Alert.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.436
Captain, when the wave hit,

05:13.513 --> 05:15.481
our communications array
received a download.

05:15.548 --> 05:16.879
What sort of download?

05:17.016 --> 05:18.449
l'm not sure.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.780
Lots of information.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.320
l can't decipher it,
but there's an audio component.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.083
Let's hear it.

05:32.598 --> 05:35.726
Harry, try all the standard
decryption algorithms.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.268
lt's strange.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.668
The wave followed us,

05:38.738 --> 05:41.070
but it didn't cause any damage.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.474
lnstead, we get a download
to our database.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.342
l'd say it's a pretty good bet

05:47.413 --> 05:49.381
somebody's trying
to tell us something.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.781
The wave left
a residual ion trail.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.944
We might be able
to locate its point of origin.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.850
Set a course.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.564
Looks like it's taken
quite a beating.

06:13.673 --> 06:14.640
Life signs?

06:14.741 --> 06:16.174
One. Nonhumanoid.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.641
lt's very faint.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.677
Probably injured.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.076
Beam it to Sick Bay.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.579
Are you sure that's wise,
Captain?

06:21.647 --> 06:23.239
l'm betting
that message we received

06:23.316 --> 06:24.681
was some sort of distress call

06:24.751 --> 06:27.811
and if we're going to help,
l'd rather do it on Voyager.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.545
The physiology is so unusual

06:30.623 --> 06:33.091
the tricorder can't make heads
or tails of it.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.854
The creature's
obviously injured,

06:34.927 --> 06:36.861
but l haven't a clue
how to treat it

06:36.929 --> 06:38.396
or even diagnose it.

06:38.464 --> 06:41.262
My scans came up with something
interesting, Captain.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.165
The interfaces
on the alien's vessel

06:43.269 --> 06:45.737
can only be activated
chemically.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.499
l'm guessing that this life-form

06:47.607 --> 06:49.939
somehow interfaces directly
with the ship's systems

06:50.042 --> 06:52.943
using biochemical secretions
to give commands.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.173
That would explain
how it can fly a ship.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.738
l'm hoping this can
also help us figure out...

07:02.288 --> 07:04.017
No! You'll hurt B'Elanna!

07:04.090 --> 07:05.489
Get it off of me!

07:05.558 --> 07:07.321
Janeway to Kim.
Beam the alien life-form

07:07.393 --> 07:09.953
back to its vessel now!

07:10.029 --> 07:11.792
l'm having trouble
getting a lock.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.662
lt's piercing her neck!

07:19.305 --> 07:21.535
Her heart and lungs
are seriously compromised

07:21.607 --> 07:23.165
and her kidneys are failing.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.506
The creature's also secreting
some kind of paralyzing agent

07:25.578 --> 07:26.704
into her bloodstream.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.144
How do we get it off her?

07:28.214 --> 07:29.374
l can't remove it surgically,

07:29.449 --> 07:30.882
not without doing
irreparable harm

07:31.017 --> 07:32.109
to B'Elanna's internal organs.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.709
Can we get a lock
on the creature--

07:33.786 --> 07:34.718
transport it off?

07:34.787 --> 07:35.879
Not unless we want to beam

07:35.955 --> 07:38.082
B'Elanna's cardiopulmonary
system along with it.

07:38.157 --> 07:39.522
We have to do something!

07:39.592 --> 07:41.321
No one is disputing
that, Mr. Paris.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.827
The question is: What?

07:42.895 --> 07:45.227
lf l'm to have any hope
of devising a treatment,

07:45.298 --> 07:47.391
l'll need to brush up
on my exobiology.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.458
What do you mean, ''brush up''?

07:49.535 --> 07:51.730
Don't you have all this
information in your database?

07:51.838 --> 07:53.999
l may be a walking
medical encyclopedia,

07:54.106 --> 07:55.937
but even l don't know
everything.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.703
My matrix simply isn't
large enough.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.438
Maybe we can do
better than giving you

07:59.512 --> 08:00.706
a crash course in exobiology.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.805
Maybe we can provide
you with a consultant.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.177
l'd be delighted, but how?

08:04.250 --> 08:07.276
By isolating the computer's
exobiology data files

08:07.353 --> 08:10.379
and merging them
into an interactive matrix.

08:10.456 --> 08:11.821
-A hologram.
-Exactly.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.482
That may not be
as simple as it sounds.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.823
lt would need to be nearly
as sophisticated as l am--

08:15.895 --> 08:17.920
tactile interfaces,
personality subroutines...

08:17.997 --> 08:19.328
Harry could do it.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.628
Search the database
for a leading exobiologist.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.827
lf you want to add
a personality,

08:22.969 --> 08:24.436
it may as well be based
on a real person.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.232
l'll have Harry meet you
on Holodeck 2.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.364
Stay with her
and monitor her vital signs.

08:28.474 --> 08:29.805
Call me if there's any change.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.844
l still have my doubts
about this, Doc.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.442
lt's one thing
to create a simple hologram,

08:40.520 --> 08:41.748
but you're trying to merge

08:41.821 --> 08:44.085
an extensive database
with an interactive matrix.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.589
Don't be a pessimist, Mr. Kim.

08:45.658 --> 08:46.852
Together, we'll create

08:46.926 --> 08:48.757
a masterpiece
of holographic art.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.762
A subject
for your next slide show?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.058
-Perhaps.
-Can't wait.

08:52.131 --> 08:54.656
What's the name of that
exobiologist you chose?

08:54.734 --> 08:56.759
Crell Moset.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.234
Here's the file.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.772
Let's start with the parameters
for physical appearance.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.036
Computer, display
a holographic simulation

09:04.110 --> 09:05.577
of Crell Moset.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.447
Have you mentioned
to anyone else

09:09.515 --> 09:10.812
that this guy's a Cardassian?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.181
What difference does it make?

09:13.252 --> 09:14.514
Maybe you haven't heard.

09:14.587 --> 09:15.519
They're not the exactly

09:15.588 --> 09:16.816
the friendliest folks
in the galaxy.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.481
l don't care
if he's the nastiest man

09:18.558 --> 09:21.083
who ever lived, as long as he
can help us save B'Elanna.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.286
Good point.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.455
Computer, transfer
all referenced medical files

09:25.531 --> 09:27.089
to the simulation.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.599
Transfer complete.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.966
Now install
personality subroutines

09:31.070 --> 09:33.630
and voice approximation.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.263
lnstallation complete.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.669
Dr. Moset, l'd like
to consult with you

09:40.746 --> 09:42.077
about an alien life-form.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.673
l am Crell Moset,

09:44.750 --> 09:47.344
Chief Exobiology Specialist
Cardassia Prime,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.684
...to perform
all surgical procedures.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.655
This is going well.
What's wrong?

09:51.724 --> 09:54.192
Some sort of overload
in the interactive matrix.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.091
Can you clear it up?

09:56.162 --> 09:57.254
l'm trying.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.663
Computer, install
a recursive algorithm.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.327
Algorithm installed.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.199
Try it again.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.703
Dr. Moset?

10:06.772 --> 10:10.173
My friends call me Crell.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.776
lt's a pleasure to meet you,
Crell.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.822
And you, good man,
what's your name?

10:23.889 --> 10:28.155
Actually, l'm in between
names at the moment.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.161
l'm an Emergency
Medical Hologram.

10:30.229 --> 10:31.696
lnteresting.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.425
But his friends call him Doc.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.899
Aha. May l presume?

10:36.002 --> 10:37.333
Certainly.

10:37.436 --> 10:40.337
So, Doc, how can
an old surgeon like me

10:40.406 --> 10:43.341
help a technological marvel
such as yourself?

10:43.409 --> 10:45.001
Oh, well...

10:45.144 --> 10:47.442
l've got a patient
with a rather unusual problem.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.539
She's become fused
with a nonhumanoid life-form

10:50.616 --> 10:51.810
l know nothing about.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.749
Nonhumanoid exobiology

10:53.819 --> 10:55.548
happens to be one
of my specialties.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.714
That's exactly why we've
created your program.

10:57.790 --> 10:58.882
Program?

10:58.958 --> 11:00.391
You're a hologram as well.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.620
lnteresting.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.856
l'd like to see the patient
right away.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.329
Mr. Kim, would you
do the honors, please?

11:06.399 --> 11:07.832
No problem.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.891
Listen,
if he destabilizes again,

11:10.036 --> 11:11.628
take him off-line and call me.

11:11.737 --> 11:12.761
Understood.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.106
Lieutenant,
may l present Crell Moset?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.406
lt's a pleasure.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.879
She's been drifting
in and out of consciousness.

11:22.948 --> 11:24.848
Don't be rude, Lieutenant.

11:24.917 --> 11:25.884
To him?

11:25.951 --> 11:28.442
No offense, Doc,
but he's just a...

11:28.521 --> 11:30.819
A brilliant scientist
who's here to help us.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.323
This way, Crell.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.757
Hmm... l can see
why you're having difficulty.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.351
lts physiology doesn't match

11:36.429 --> 11:39.091
any of the standard
templates in our database.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.963
My guess would be
a cytoplasmic life-form.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.194
l agree.
And from what l can tell,

11:44.303 --> 11:46.464
it has co-opted
her vital systems.

11:46.572 --> 11:47.698
She's Klingon...

11:47.807 --> 11:50.776
No, the cranial ridges
are less pronounced.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.003
Klingon-human hybrid.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.008
Exactly.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.407
Let's hope your instincts

11:54.480 --> 11:56.607
about the creature
are equally insightful.

11:56.682 --> 11:57.649
l'm afraid

11:57.717 --> 11:59.651
this one is going
to require more

11:59.719 --> 12:01.209
than a visual assessment.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.288
You have
an isomolecular scanner.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.018
No. Just a standard issue
Starfleet tricorder.

12:06.092 --> 12:09.755
No wonder you're having problems
making an accurate diagnosis.

12:09.829 --> 12:12.297
l suggested an upgrade
to the Starfleet people

12:12.364 --> 12:13.888
at a joint medical conference,

12:13.999 --> 12:17.799
but they assumed l was
just an arrogant Cardassian

12:17.903 --> 12:20.531
trying to prove
his superiority...

12:20.639 --> 12:22.732
or maybe they thought
l was a spy.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.935
l hope you weren't too offended.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.308
lt's an unfortunate reality.

12:27.379 --> 12:31.440
Sometimes even enlightened
races can't find common ground.

12:31.517 --> 12:37.547
l may be able
to recalibrate this thing.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.523
There. That should help.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.361
Amazing.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.869
Well, someone from Starfleet
appreciates me.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.169
l've instructed the computer
to assign symbols

12:55.241 --> 12:57.607
to all the tones received
in the transmission.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.805
Looks like there were over
10,000 separate sounds

13:01.914 --> 13:03.313
used in this section
of the message.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.214
lt's going to be
a tough code to crack.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.410
Maybe we can get a little help

13:06.485 --> 13:07.884
from the alien vessel's
data banks.

13:07.953 --> 13:08.885
Good idea.

13:08.988 --> 13:09.886
Janeway to Seven of Nine.

13:09.989 --> 13:10.887
Yes.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.355
Any chance of downloading
the alien's data banks?

13:13.425 --> 13:14.392
We're looking for anything

13:14.460 --> 13:15.893
that might help us
understand their language.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.054
We don't know how much time
B'Elanna has left.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.098
We must move quickly.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.657
The vessel is on the verge
of a complete systems failure.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.292
Prepare to download the data.

13:24.403 --> 13:25.870
l heard the Captain.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.405
ls there a problem?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.566
No. No problem.

13:29.675 --> 13:32.166
You seem uncomfortable
taking orders from me.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.768
lt's just that l'm
used to taking orders

13:33.846 --> 13:34.778
from B'Elanna, that's all

13:34.847 --> 13:36.439
and to tell you the truth,
she doesn't...

13:36.515 --> 13:37.948
Doesn't like me.
Yes, l am aware of that.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.482
However, the Captain
left me in charge

13:39.552 --> 13:41.611
during Lieutenant Torres'
absence.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.518
Her feelings about me
are irrelevant.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.614
Activate the interface
transceiver.

13:45.691 --> 13:47.886
Begin the download.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.952
l'm picking up a fluctuation

13:51.030 --> 13:52.964
in the alien ship's
power source.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.794
lt's disrupting
the interface transceiver.

13:55.901 --> 13:56.799
Reinitialize.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.199
l'm working on it.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.864
lts systems are overloading.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.406
Red Alert.

14:02.474 --> 14:03.873
Engineering to Bridge.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.967
The alien vessel
is destabilizing.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.876
lts destruction is imminent.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.881
Can you download
the information first?

14:09.949 --> 14:11.746
We're trying.

14:11.817 --> 14:13.751
Captain, it's going to explode.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.116
Ensign, back us off.

14:25.264 --> 14:26.891
What do we know so far?

14:26.999 --> 14:29.194
The life-form has taken
control of her body

14:29.301 --> 14:30.563
at the autonomic level,

14:30.669 --> 14:32.569
drawing proteins
from her tissues,

14:32.638 --> 14:34.435
white blood cells
from her arteries.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.371
Which can be interpreted
in several ways.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.568
A form of attack.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.042
l find it odd

14:39.111 --> 14:41.477
that a species would evolve
an attack mechanism

14:41.547 --> 14:43.412
that would leave it
so vulnerable.

14:43.482 --> 14:46.383
Why not do its damage
and retreat?

14:46.452 --> 14:47.783
A parasite perhaps?

14:47.853 --> 14:49.218
Yes, l think so,

14:49.288 --> 14:51.848
but not any ordinary variety.

14:51.924 --> 14:55.087
lt's unlikely it could
sustain itself like this

14:55.160 --> 14:56.787
over the long term.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.261
lts own systems are damaged.

14:58.330 --> 15:02.130
lt's doing this as a stopgap
measure to keep itself alive.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.067
So the patient's heart,
lungs, kidneys--

15:05.137 --> 15:08.436
they're all augmenting
the alien's damaged system.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.202
lt's using B'Elanna
as a life preserver.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.006
But if it needs her to survive,

15:13.078 --> 15:16.241
it's not about to let go
without a fight.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.579
l'd like to think that's a fight
you and l can win.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.619
We do work well together.

15:20.686 --> 15:25.214
l just wish we had access
to my laboratory.

15:25.291 --> 15:29.455
lt has all the instrumentation
we would need.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.120
Well, we'll just
have to improvise.

15:31.196 --> 15:32.390
Not necessarily.

15:32.464 --> 15:35.194
We may be able to create
a reasonable facsimile

15:35.301 --> 15:36.893
of your laboratory
in our holodeck--

15:37.002 --> 15:38.026
providing, of course,

15:38.137 --> 15:39.365
you can give
an accurate description.

15:39.471 --> 15:42.338
Oh, down to the smallest detail.

15:42.408 --> 15:46.868
lt's more of a home to me
than... than my home.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.150
Tom.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.282
Hey, there.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.653
l can't move.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.254
l know.

16:06.332 --> 16:07.321
But don't worry.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.264
We'll get this thing off you.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.369
Just think.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.768
l could force you to listen
to rock 'n' roll all day

16:13.839 --> 16:16.069
and you wouldn't be able
to do a thing about it.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.011
Who is that?

16:20.079 --> 16:21.171
Relax.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.873
He's just a hologram--

16:22.982 --> 16:25.212
a specialist in exobiology.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.583
The Doc thinks he might be able
to help you.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.679
Can't he find somebody else?

16:30.756 --> 16:33.554
Apparently, this guy's the best.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.890
Besides, he's just
a walking database.

16:36.962 --> 16:42.025
Hologram or not,
he's Cardassian.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.328
As far as l'm concerned,

16:43.435 --> 16:45.198
they're all
cold-blooded killers.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.273
l understand how you feel.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.104
Unfortunately,
that cold-blooded killer

16:51.176 --> 16:54.270
may be the only one
who can save your life.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.455
lmpressive.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.821
Mm.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.054
ls this where you did your work
on the Fostossa virus?

17:10.128 --> 17:12.996
No. Actually, l was

17:13.065 --> 17:16.830
on Bajor at the time,
during the occupation.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.961
A sad chapter
in Cardassian history.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.438
We had no business being there,

17:22.508 --> 17:25.636
but try telling that
to the politicians.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.874
When l think of the resources
that were squandered,

17:28.981 --> 17:31.472
the lives that were lost...

17:31.550 --> 17:34.348
From what l understand,
you saved thousands of lives.

17:34.420 --> 17:38.015
ln retrospect, l don't know how.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.990
The military had
everything they needed,

17:40.059 --> 17:41.390
but the civilian hospitals?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.894
No staff,
the crudest equipment...

17:43.962 --> 17:44.894
Don't tell me.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.157
You were forced to improvise.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.220
Yes!

17:47.299 --> 17:48.231
l know what that's like.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.392
l didn't have the resources

17:49.501 --> 17:52.629
to try traditional methods,
so l experimented

17:52.738 --> 17:56.799
with procedures that never
would have occurred to me

17:56.909 --> 17:58.638
under ordinary circumstances.

17:58.710 --> 18:03.170
The discovery of the cure was
almost accidental, really.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.272
You're being modest, Crell.

18:04.349 --> 18:05.281
No.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.612
You made medical history.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.619
You won the Legate's
Crest of Valor.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.348
Awards aren't important, Doc.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.151
lt's the work that matters.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.283
Of course.

18:14.359 --> 18:17.419
Still, the recognition
of your peers, your government

18:17.496 --> 18:19.020
must be very satisfying.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.464
l'm sure you've made your
share of breakthroughs.

18:21.533 --> 18:25.560
Naturally. Unfortunately,
no one from Starfleet

18:25.671 --> 18:27.104
ever hears about them.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.469
l toil in obscurity.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.031
Why don't you show me
your patient records?

18:31.143 --> 18:33.873
At least l'll know
about your accomplishments.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.639
All right.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.875
Everything seems to be in order.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.483
Shall we get to work?

18:39.551 --> 18:42.076
Computer, create
a holographic re-creation

18:42.154 --> 18:43.849
of the alien in Sick Bay.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.722
Hand me that cortical
stimulator, will you?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.357
Yes. Thank you.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.094
Captain's Log, supplemental.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.601
While the Doctor seems
to be making progress,

18:58.670 --> 19:00.661
Commander Chakotay and l
have hit a wall

19:00.772 --> 19:04.264
in our attempt
to decipher the alien message.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.071
lt was a distress call, right?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.545
So maybe if we retransmitted
that message,

19:08.614 --> 19:11.276
others of the species would
realize we need their help.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.341
We don't know where they are.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.579
We'll send it on
all subspace bands.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.053
lf they're out there,
they'll hear it.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.453
They might turn out
to be unfriendly.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.684
The Doctor's pretty sure

19:19.758 --> 19:22.124
the alien is simply trying
to survive. l agree.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.684
lt'll be a difficult
first contact,

19:23.762 --> 19:25.491
but we might find a way
to communicate.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.122
lt's worth a shot.

19:28.867 --> 19:33.327
Tuvok, reroute auxiliary power
to the deflector dish.

19:33.438 --> 19:36.339
Retransmit the alien's message
on all subspace bands.

19:36.408 --> 19:37.670
Aye, Captain.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.209
Deflector at full capacity.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.113
Chakotay.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.167
l'm sorry.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.204
My wife tells me l'm tone deaf.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.272
Not at all.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.306
You were right on key.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.635
lf you enjoy music,

20:09.708 --> 20:12.643
we can run some opera programs
after we're finished.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.905
l'd like that.

20:13.979 --> 20:16.675
l think we're ready
for a look inside.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.147
Scalpel?

20:20.185 --> 20:21.618
Forgive me for saying so,

20:21.687 --> 20:23.951
but this appears to be
a rather crude instrument,

20:24.056 --> 20:26.286
especially when we have
such advanced equipment

20:26.358 --> 20:27.620
at our disposal.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.787
l often find the simplest tool
is the most effective.

20:30.862 --> 20:34.229
All of our elaborate scanners
and laser scalpels--

20:34.299 --> 20:36.494
they remove us
from our subjects.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.536
Actually feeling the anatomy,

20:38.604 --> 20:40.799
the consistency
of the internal organs,

20:40.906 --> 20:42.533
it can be very instructive.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.734
Why don't you do the honors?

20:44.810 --> 20:49.543
Uh, make a vertical incision,
say, 12 centimeters,

20:49.615 --> 20:50.673
starting here.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.254
We're hurting it.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.415
Doctor, it's a hologram.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.220
Of course.

21:01.326 --> 21:04.261
l guess as a hologram myself,
l have a certain empathy.

21:04.296 --> 21:05.263
Keep going.

21:11.470 --> 21:12.869
Extraordinary.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.906
Look at that series of nodes.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.338
They appear to be clustered
along the primary nerve.

21:17.409 --> 21:18.842
Multiple neocortices, l'd say.

21:18.910 --> 21:21.105
Suggesting a highly
intelligent species.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.943
Yes, but also presenting
us with a point of attack.

21:24.082 --> 21:25.106
Attack?

21:25.183 --> 21:28.175
lf we induce a neurostatic shock
in one of these nodes,

21:28.253 --> 21:29.948
l believe it will travel
to the others,

21:30.088 --> 21:31.817
the creature will lose
motor function

21:31.890 --> 21:33.482
and we'll be able to remove it.

21:33.558 --> 21:36.049
The procedure will probably
kill the creature.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.186
Probably.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.594
l'd like to find a way
to save them both.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.428
So would l
in an ideal situation,

21:41.500 --> 21:43.092
but we have to set priorities,

21:43.201 --> 21:45.294
which, in this case,
is your crewmate.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.871
This is a sentient life-form.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.941
For all we know, it could be
this species' Einstein,

21:50.042 --> 21:51.009
its Picasso.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.168
Or he could be
a psychotic criminal.

21:53.245 --> 21:56.908
The point is, we don't know
and we have choices to make.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.882
Your program's destabilizing.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.247
This is such poor timing.

22:00.352 --> 22:03.082
l'll have to take you off-line,
but don't worry.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.555
We'll have you up
and running again in no time.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.889
Computer, take Medical
Consultant Program off-line.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.894
Doctor to Ensign Kim.

22:10.962 --> 22:11.894
Go ahead, Doc.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.487
Our new program's destabilizing.

22:13.565 --> 22:14.725
l'll meet you in Sick Bay.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.700
We'll try
to reinitialize him there.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.269
Tabor, l could use some help.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.326
Yes, sir.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.338
Try again.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.376
No luck.

22:25.444 --> 22:26.536
Would it be easier

22:26.611 --> 22:28.636
if we reduced
the hologram's memory load?

22:28.714 --> 22:29.908
Maybe, but l don't want

22:29.981 --> 22:32.142
to do that
unless we absolutely have to.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.787
What's going on?

22:36.855 --> 22:39.483
My consultant's gone off-line.

22:39.558 --> 22:40.923
The Cardassian?

22:40.992 --> 22:43.085
You can leave him off.

22:43.161 --> 22:45.857
l'm surprised
by your attitude, Lieutenant.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.126
l never took you for someone

22:48.200 --> 22:51.101
who would make generalizations
based on race.

22:51.169 --> 22:55.868
When it comes to Cardassians,
l'm guilty as charged.

22:55.941 --> 23:00.401
l understand your experience
with them was unpleasant,

23:00.479 --> 23:02.709
but if you give Crell a chance,
l think you'll find

23:02.781 --> 23:05.113
that he's a friendly,
compassionate man,

23:05.183 --> 23:07.208
not to mention a genius
who's trying to save your life.

23:07.285 --> 23:11.153
l'll skip the introductions
if it's all the same to you.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.815
Suit yourself,

23:12.891 --> 23:16.088
but you should know
l plan on asking the Captain

23:16.161 --> 23:18.891
to keep him on
as a permanent consultant.

23:18.997 --> 23:22.592
l'm not the only one who's going
to have a problem with that.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.896
Well, you'll just have
to get used to it.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.563
Who knows?
You may even grow to like him.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.140
Don't hold your breath.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.076
How's it coming?

23:34.146 --> 23:35.135
We're close.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.147
Actually,
l think that should do it.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.648
Good.

23:38.717 --> 23:40.150
Computer, reactivate

23:40.218 --> 23:42.709
Medical Consultant Program
Beta-1.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.315
Hello, again.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.154
My God.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.386
What's wrong?

23:49.461 --> 23:51.224
That's Crell Moset.

23:51.296 --> 23:53.355
Yes. Do l know you?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.799
He killed my brother,
my grandfather--

23:56.902 --> 23:58.699
hundreds of people.

23:58.804 --> 24:01.102
He's a mass murderer.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.102
You must be mistaken.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.012
lt's no mistake.

24:11.082 --> 24:13.073
Moset performed experiments
on living people.

24:13.151 --> 24:14.550
Thousands of Bajorans
were killed

24:14.619 --> 24:15.984
in his so-called hospital.

24:16.054 --> 24:16.986
ls this true?

24:17.055 --> 24:18.215
No, no. He's...

24:18.290 --> 24:20.417
There must be
some misunderstanding.

24:20.492 --> 24:21.481
The liar.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.993
Take it easy, Tabor.

24:23.061 --> 24:24.688
Whoa. He's just a hologram.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.094
l'm upsetting him.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.096
l should go.

24:27.165 --> 24:28.598
l'm sorry about this.

24:30.235 --> 24:33.102
Computer, transfer
Medical Consultant Program

24:33.171 --> 24:34.502
to Holodeck 2.

24:41.012 --> 24:45.676
l can still remember the sounds
his instruments made...

24:45.750 --> 24:48.776
the screams of his patients...

24:48.854 --> 24:49.821
the smell...

24:49.888 --> 24:52.083
of chemicals and dead flesh.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.650
He operated on my grandfather...

24:56.728 --> 25:00.220
exposed his internal organs
to nadion radiation.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.391
lt took six days for him to die.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.800
l promised myself
l would never forget.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.269
You were very young.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.797
ls it possible your memory
of these events is inaccurate?

25:10.909 --> 25:12.240
My memory's just fine.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.972
He blinded people so he
could study how they adapted,

25:15.046 --> 25:17.310
exposed them to polytrinic
acid just to see

25:17.382 --> 25:19.816
how long it would take
for their skin to heal.

25:19.885 --> 25:22.683
Ensign, the man you're accusing
cured the Fostossa virus.

25:22.754 --> 25:25.484
He stopped an epidemic that
killed thousands of Bajorans.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.320
By infecting hundreds
of people...

25:27.392 --> 25:30.225
so that he could experiment
with different treatments--

25:30.295 --> 25:31.762
old, helpless people...

25:31.830 --> 25:33.559
like my grandfather...

25:33.632 --> 25:35.896
because he considered
their lives worthless.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.332
How do you know this?

25:37.435 --> 25:38.663
Everybody knew.

25:38.770 --> 25:41.432
l remember some of the Maquis
under my command

25:41.540 --> 25:44.202
talking about an infamous
Cardassian doctor.

25:45.944 --> 25:48.139
Could these simply
have been rumors

25:48.213 --> 25:50.943
spread by Bajorans
who hated the Cardassians?

25:51.082 --> 25:52.106
l was there.

25:53.451 --> 25:57.251
l don't understand
why this isn't in our database.

25:57.322 --> 25:59.654
The Cardassians
didn't exactly publicize

25:59.724 --> 26:01.692
their wartime medical practices.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.591
l wouldn't be surprised
if the real Moset went on

26:04.629 --> 26:05.960
to live a normal life.

26:06.031 --> 26:10.491
He's the Chairman of Exobiology
at the University of Culat.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.095
We may not be able
to do anything

26:14.205 --> 26:16.469
about the real Moset,
Commander...

26:16.541 --> 26:19.169
but the program
should be destroyed.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.212
Every trace
of that man's research

26:21.279 --> 26:23.213
should be deleted
from the database.

26:25.850 --> 26:28.114
l had a bad feeling
about that hologram

26:28.186 --> 26:29.448
the second l saw him.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.921
Looks like your instinct
was right.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.017
l won't let him near me.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.584
You're kidding, right?

26:37.662 --> 26:40.096
No, l am dead serious.

26:40.165 --> 26:41.757
B'Elanna...

26:41.833 --> 26:44.131
lf l let that pig
operate on me...

26:44.235 --> 26:48.103
l'll be benefiting
from other people's suffering.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.765
You're not being rational.

26:49.874 --> 26:52.240
l won't do it.

26:54.479 --> 26:56.310
What's happening?

26:56.381 --> 26:59.077
Her cytotoxin levels are
going through the roof.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.549
Pulse is rapid and irregular.

27:00.652 --> 27:03.143
No doubt you've said
something to upset her.

27:03.188 --> 27:06.954
What she's upset about, Doc,
is your Cardassian buddy.

27:07.025 --> 27:07.957
Tell him.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.288
Tell me what?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.522
She refuses
to let him treat her.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.826
B'Elanna, we're very close
to a solution.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.023
Do it...

27:15.100 --> 27:16.465
...without him.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.627
l don't know that l can.

27:18.737 --> 27:19.931
Find another way.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.503
She's going
into cytotoxic shock!

27:24.576 --> 27:26.635
Two milligrams inaprovaline!

27:35.854 --> 27:38.254
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.087
l've managed to stabilize
Lieutenant Torres

27:41.159 --> 27:44.060
for the time being,
but the matter of how to proceed

27:44.129 --> 27:46.529
with her treatment
remains unresolved.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.361
lsolate data block 0459.

27:48.433 --> 27:49.730
Ensign.

27:49.801 --> 27:50.790
You wanted to see me?

27:50.902 --> 27:52.369
We've been looking for evidence

27:52.437 --> 27:54.098
that might support
Tabor's accusations.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.229
Anything?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.705
Actually, that's
why we called you here.

27:56.775 --> 27:57.707
lt's not looking good.

27:57.776 --> 27:58.708
Show me.

27:58.777 --> 27:59.835
We've been reviewing data

27:59.911 --> 28:01.503
on the Cardassian
occupation of Bajor--

28:01.613 --> 28:03.547
the alleged site
of Moset's crimes.

28:03.581 --> 28:06.175
Strategic information,
log entries kept in battle,

28:06.251 --> 28:09.186
sensor scans from Starfleet
vessels-- this, for example.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.451
Requisition records from one
of Crell Moset's hospitals.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.014
He was purchasing
biochemical agents,

28:14.092 --> 28:16.390
including every known strain
of the Fostossa virus.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.656
Of course he needed
samples of the virus.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.561
That's how vaccines
are developed.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.327
Take a look
at the requisition orders.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.628
Moset didn't ask
for any of the enzymes

28:26.738 --> 28:29.172
normally required
for synthesizing a vaccine.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.502
lt gets worse.

28:30.575 --> 28:32.975
Four days after he received
the virus samples,

28:33.044 --> 28:35.069
there was a minor outbreak
of Fostossa

28:35.146 --> 28:36.841
in the vicinity of his hospital.

28:36.915 --> 28:38.246
Prior to that date,

28:38.316 --> 28:41.877
there had not been a single case
in the entire province.

28:41.953 --> 28:45.389
l have to report these findings
to Commander Chakotay.

28:47.759 --> 28:48.885
lt is curious.

28:49.027 --> 28:52.622
The Borg are accused
of assimilating information

28:52.697 --> 28:54.494
with no regard for life.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.625
This Cardassian did the same

28:56.735 --> 28:59.329
and yet, his behavior
is tolerated.

29:11.850 --> 29:13.215
Ah, there you are.

29:13.284 --> 29:15.946
l'm almost ready
to begin the surgery.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.716
Lieutenant Torres won't allow
you to have anything to do

29:18.790 --> 29:20.587
with her treatment.

29:20.658 --> 29:22.956
Because of that Bajoran?

29:23.027 --> 29:25.791
We've gathered
some corroborating evidence.

29:25.864 --> 29:28.298
lt appears that he's
telling the truth.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.596
You committed
a series of atrocities

29:30.702 --> 29:32.294
during the Cardassian War.

29:32.403 --> 29:35.839
Thousands of Bajorans died
on your surgical tables.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.033
That's absurd.

29:37.142 --> 29:40.373
And even if it were true,
l'm only a hologram

29:40.445 --> 29:43.107
and l have no memory
of those events.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.672
They're not part
of my programming.

29:45.750 --> 29:50.346
But you are the holographic
representation of Crell Moset.

29:50.421 --> 29:54.255
Your program,
despite all its brilliance,

29:54.325 --> 29:56.350
is based on his work.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.361
He infected patients,

29:58.429 --> 30:02.092
exposed them to polytrinic acid,
mutilated their living bodies

30:02.167 --> 30:05.500
and now we're reaping the
benefits of those experiments.

30:05.603 --> 30:09.903
Medically, ethically,
it's wrong.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.738
What do you suggest
we do about it?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.405
l'm not sure.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.244
We may have
to delete your program.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.578
Delete me?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.585
What about our patient?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.918
l suppose l'd have to try
and treat her on my own.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.925
No offense, but you need me.

30:28.993 --> 30:29.960
l realize that.

30:30.094 --> 30:31.425
You're a physician.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.158
You know there's always
a price to pay

30:34.232 --> 30:36.962
for the advancement
of medical science.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.932
Sometimes that price
is too high.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.163
Torture?

30:40.271 --> 30:42.239
Your word, not mine.

30:42.307 --> 30:45.970
l cured the Fostossa virus,
didn't l?

30:46.044 --> 30:48.239
So these experiments
you say l conducted

30:48.313 --> 30:50.474
obviously helped me
devise a treatment.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.914
lmagine how many lives
would have been lost

30:52.984 --> 30:54.975
if l hadn't eliminated
this disease.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.281
That doesn't justify

30:56.354 --> 30:58.788
using people
in laboratory experiments.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.757
As l explained to you,

31:00.859 --> 31:05.489
during the occupation,
l was forced to improvise.

31:05.530 --> 31:08.192
l used what resources l had.

31:08.266 --> 31:11.394
And ethical considerations,
they mean nothing to you?

31:11.502 --> 31:14.903
Ethics are arbitrary.

31:14.973 --> 31:21.071
How do you suppose your own
database was developed? Hmm?

31:21.145 --> 31:24.740
My God, half the medical
knowledge acquired on Earth

31:24.816 --> 31:27.717
came through experiments
on lower animals.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.446
But not people.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.283
lt's convenient to draw a line

31:31.356 --> 31:33.950
between higher and lower
species, isn't it?

31:34.058 --> 31:36.151
This is the 24th century, Crell.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.128
Your kind of barbarism
ended a long time ago

31:39.197 --> 31:41.131
or, at least, it should have.

31:41.199 --> 31:43.190
What difference does it make

31:43.268 --> 31:45.736
how long ago
the research occurred?

31:45.837 --> 31:48.271
What matters is
that we can use it

31:48.339 --> 31:49.966
to help patients today.

31:50.108 --> 31:53.373
Now, are you going

31:53.444 --> 32:00.008
to delete my program and all
of the research it contains,

32:00.084 --> 32:04.817
or are we going to use it
to save B'Elanna's life?

32:11.429 --> 32:13.090
Come in.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.257
Commander.

32:17.168 --> 32:20.626
This request of yours
to be relieved of duty--

32:20.738 --> 32:22.035
l won't grant it.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.199
l have the right
to resign my commission.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.469
For what reason?

32:25.543 --> 32:28.011
Moral objections
to this ship's medical policy.

32:30.982 --> 32:33.849
l understand
how difficult this is for you,

32:33.918 --> 32:35.886
but you've got
to let go of the past.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.946
Focus on today, and today,
B'Elanna's life is in danger.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.955
Everything else
should be put aside.

32:41.092 --> 32:41.956
You don't have the right

32:42.093 --> 32:43.287
to violate the memory
of my family.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.522
As long as that Cardassian
hologram is on line,

32:45.596 --> 32:47.154
that's exactly
what you're doing.

32:47.231 --> 32:48.630
lt's not that simple.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.962
lt is to me.

32:50.134 --> 32:53.126
Crell Moset killed thousands
of people in his hospitals.

32:53.237 --> 32:56.138
As long as we're willing
to benefit from his research,

32:56.207 --> 32:57.697
we're no better than he is.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.977
lf l had weeks, or even days,

33:04.048 --> 33:05.982
maybe l could come up
with an alternative,

33:06.050 --> 33:08.644
but time is of the essence
and Moset's idea will work.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.187
Then you've got to use it.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.381
Even if the Doctor
could perform the surgery

33:12.457 --> 33:13.481
without Moset's help,

33:13.558 --> 33:15.458
he'd still be using
the man's research.

33:15.526 --> 33:17.721
That would be going
against B'Elanna's wishes.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.092
We're talking about a woman

33:19.163 --> 33:21.688
who has alien tendrils
sapping the life out of her.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.631
She's obviously
not thinking straight.

33:23.735 --> 33:24.633
On the contrary.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.294
Her concerns are based in logic.

33:26.404 --> 33:28.167
Logic?

33:28.239 --> 33:30.264
lf the Doctor uses knowledge
that Moset gained

33:30.375 --> 33:32.536
through his experiments,
we would be validating

33:32.610 --> 33:35.101
his methods, inviting
further unethical research.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.771
We'd be setting
a terrible precedent.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.043
We're in the middle
of the Delta Quadrant.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.049
Who would know?

33:40.118 --> 33:41.517
We would know.

33:41.586 --> 33:42.644
Fine.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.654
Let's just deactivate
the evil hologram

33:44.722 --> 33:45.814
and let B'Elanna die.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.915
At least, we'd have
our morals intact.

33:47.992 --> 33:49.823
-Tom.
-And you, Chakotay,

33:49.894 --> 33:51.885
since when do you care
what Starfleet thinks?

33:51.963 --> 33:53.658
This isn't about rules
and regulations.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.198
This is about doing
what's right.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.733
Spoken like a true Maquis.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.461
Well, if you'd just
set aside your hatred

33:58.569 --> 34:00.434
of the Cardassian
for one second...

34:00.538 --> 34:01.470
Enough, Lieutenant.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.871
All right, all right.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.602
The arguments have been made
and we're running out of time.

34:05.676 --> 34:07.041
The fact is, you're both right.

34:07.111 --> 34:08.373
But when it comes down to it,

34:08.446 --> 34:09.879
the only issue
l'm concerned about

34:10.014 --> 34:12.447
is the well-being of that
crew member lying in Sick Bay.

34:12.516 --> 34:15.281
We'll wrestle with the morality
of this situation later--

34:15.353 --> 34:17.184
after B'Elanna is
back on her feet.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.882
Doctor, you have
my authorization to proceed

34:20.024 --> 34:21.514
with Moset's assistance.

34:21.592 --> 34:22.684
Yes, Captain.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.058
Any consequences
of this decision

34:25.129 --> 34:27.029
will be my responsibility.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.158
Dismissed.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.603
Thanks.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.585
Scalpel.

35:07.939 --> 35:11.306
Ensign Kim,
do you hear something?

35:11.375 --> 35:12.842
Hear what?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.878
A series of high frequencies.

35:15.012 --> 35:16.741
They are getting louder.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.873
Must be those Vulcan
ears of yours.

35:20.785 --> 35:21.979
l hear it, too.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.611
Anything on sensors?

35:24.889 --> 35:27.449
lt appears to be
an alien com signal.

35:27.525 --> 35:28.685
Triaxilating wavelengths.

35:28.759 --> 35:29.691
Origins?

35:29.760 --> 35:30.852
Unknown.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.098
Captain, a vessel
just dropped out of warp.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.598
Approaching fast
off the port bow.

35:35.666 --> 35:36.758
On screen.

35:38.035 --> 35:40.162
Can we dampen it a little?

35:40.271 --> 35:41.238
Negative.

35:43.074 --> 35:47.010
Harry, tell me that was just
their way of saying hello.

35:47.111 --> 35:48.237
l wish l could.

35:48.312 --> 35:51.406
The universal translator
doesn't have a clue.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.313
Perhaps they are waiting
for our response.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.944
Well, then, let's give them one.

35:56.087 --> 35:59.614
Open a channel,
all subspace bands.

36:00.658 --> 36:01.989
This is Captain Janeway

36:02.059 --> 36:04.118
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

36:04.195 --> 36:06.254
We cannot interpret
your message,

36:06.330 --> 36:08.127
but please try to understand,

36:08.199 --> 36:12.101
we are on a peaceful mission
and we intend you no harm.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.606
We have one of your kind
on board our ship.

36:15.706 --> 36:18.971
lt's injured and we're
attempting to provide treatment.

36:19.043 --> 36:20.738
lf you can understand...

36:22.346 --> 36:27.283
l'm ready to stimulate
the primary neural pathways.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.649
Cortical probe.

36:32.790 --> 36:36.191
l'm applying it
to the primary neocortex.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.425
lts motor control is weakening,

36:40.498 --> 36:44.059
but not enough
to release the patient.

36:44.168 --> 36:47.763
Our little friend
needs a bigger jolt.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.864
l'm increasing
the pulse frequency...

36:52.276 --> 36:53.675
The synapses are degenerating.

36:53.744 --> 36:54.711
You're killing it.

36:54.812 --> 36:56.507
Don't lose your nerve, Doctor--

36:56.581 --> 36:57.946
not when we're this close.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.482
Lower the pulse frequency.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.144
lf l do that, the creature
will regain control.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.185
l don't care.
Lower the pulse.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.916
-Doctor...
-Lower the pulse frequency

37:04.989 --> 37:06.752
or l'll take
your program off-line.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.818
You realize you're reducing
our chances of saving her?

37:11.896 --> 37:13.158
Not necessarily.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.528
Give me the probe.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.032
The probe, Doctor.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.805
lf we apply the pulse
to the secondary neocortex,

37:21.906 --> 37:24.272
we should be able
to achieve the same results

37:24.342 --> 37:25.400
at a lower frequency.

37:25.509 --> 37:27.602
Not particularly efficient.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.382
But it might prove interesting.

37:32.450 --> 37:35.578
l'm reading an energy surge
in their forward section.

37:35.653 --> 37:38.019
Shields!

37:44.095 --> 37:46.563
Doctor to Bridge.
The holodeck's going off-line.

37:46.631 --> 37:47.757
What's happening up there?

37:47.832 --> 37:48.821
Stand by, Doctor.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.163
They've locked on to us
with some sort of tractor beam.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.497
lt's draining our power.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.696
Reroute emergency power
to the holodeck.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.569
Send an antimatter surge
through the shield matrix.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.303
See if that'll
loosen their grip.

38:00.411 --> 38:01.969
No effect.

38:02.046 --> 38:04.378
We do have weapons.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.540
No. lf they wanted
to destroy us,

38:05.616 --> 38:06.947
they wouldn't be using
a tractor beam.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.451
They're trying to rescue
their crew member.

38:08.519 --> 38:09.816
Captain...

38:09.954 --> 38:12.013
This isn't about logic, Tuvok,
it's about instinct.

38:12.089 --> 38:13.522
Now, l may not speak
their language,

38:13.591 --> 38:14.615
but l have a gut feeling

38:14.692 --> 38:16.819
they don't want an armed
conflict any more than we do.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.019
Bridge to Doctor.

38:18.095 --> 38:19.027
What's your status?

38:19.096 --> 38:20.256
The procedure's working.

38:20.331 --> 38:21.457
Almost there, Captain.

38:21.532 --> 38:22.794
lt's losing motor control.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.266
The tendrils are withdrawing

38:24.368 --> 38:26.029
from her lungs,
liver, kidneys...

38:28.973 --> 38:30.873
The alien's life signs
are failing.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.636
We need a substitute
for the metabolic energy

38:32.710 --> 38:33.802
it was taking from B'Elanna.

38:33.878 --> 38:36.540
Could we restore
its own metabolism?

38:36.614 --> 38:38.809
Perhaps. Give it
40 milligrams of stenophyl.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.818
lt's going
into anaphylactic shock.

38:41.886 --> 38:42.875
All right.

38:42.953 --> 38:45.319
lncreasing the dosage
to 60 milligrams...

38:45.389 --> 38:47.186
We've lost power
on Decks 7 through 12.

38:47.258 --> 38:48.486
Shields are failing, Captain.

38:48.559 --> 38:49.491
Doctor?

38:49.560 --> 38:50.754
Stand by, Captain.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.125
Anaphylaxia is subsiding.

38:52.196 --> 38:54.494
lts electrolytic reactions
are increasing.

38:54.565 --> 38:56.829
lts metabolism is
stabilizing on its own.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.926
Bridge, beam the life-form
to its ship.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.336
Transport complete.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.901
The alien ship is
withdrawing, Captain.

39:13.684 --> 39:14.912
You're welcome.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.790
l've released B'Elanna
to her quarters.

39:23.861 --> 39:25.351
Her condition?

39:25.429 --> 39:28.364
Stable, but her nervous system
has suffered extreme trauma.

39:28.432 --> 39:31.094
She'll need time to recover--
several days, at least.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.692
Good work.

39:32.803 --> 39:34.634
l should caution you, Captain--

39:34.705 --> 39:37.435
when l told her
that we'd used Moset's program,

39:37.508 --> 39:39.476
she was unhappy,
to put it mildly.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.204
l nearly had to sedate her.

39:41.278 --> 39:44.441
lt sounds like her Klingon
temper has fully recovered.

39:44.515 --> 39:47.382
lt practically qualifies
as a chronic condition.

39:47.451 --> 39:49.885
l'll speak to her.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.683
There's one more topic
of concern.

39:51.756 --> 39:53.485
Should we delete the program

39:53.557 --> 39:56.856
or keep Moset in our database
for future emergencies?

39:58.963 --> 40:01.591
l'm inclined to leave
this up to you, Doctor.

40:01.665 --> 40:04.361
You are the Chief Medical
Officer on this ship.

40:04.468 --> 40:06.527
As far as l'm concerned,
there's no one

40:06.637 --> 40:09.105
more qualified than you
to make that decision.

40:09.173 --> 40:10.105
Thank you, Captain.

40:10.174 --> 40:11.436
But please make it quickly.

40:11.509 --> 40:12.999
l'm eager to resolve
this matter.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.839
There's been enough
moral controversy

40:14.912 --> 40:16.140
on this ship for one day.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.110
Come in.

40:26.624 --> 40:28.057
At ease.

40:29.627 --> 40:30.958
lnteresting fragrance.

40:31.028 --> 40:34.486
l'm surprised it hasn't set off
the environmental alarms.

40:34.565 --> 40:37.329
lt's a combination
of mental relaxant

40:37.435 --> 40:39.164
and expeller of demons.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.704
lt's an ancient Klingon remedy.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.002
Feeling any better?

40:44.108 --> 40:46.008
l'm alive.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.010
l hope you can understand

40:48.078 --> 40:51.172
why l went against
your wishes, B'Elanna.

40:51.248 --> 40:53.307
Losing you was unacceptable.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.987
l know you're angry, but we
need to put this behind us.

40:59.056 --> 41:00.045
Understood?

41:00.157 --> 41:01.317
ls that an order?

41:01.358 --> 41:02.791
Yes.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.556
You can't order someone to get
rid of an emotion, Captain.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.221
And what emotion is that?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.825
You had no right
to make that decision for me!

41:10.935 --> 41:12.527
l'm the Captain.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.433
You're my crewman.

41:14.538 --> 41:17.302
l did what l thought best.

41:19.577 --> 41:23.843
l get the feeling there are
still a few demons in the air.

41:23.914 --> 41:26.508
Let's hope this does
the trick, hmm?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.965
Doc...

41:42.032 --> 41:43.397
how's our patient?

41:43.467 --> 41:44.491
Recuperating.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.661
We did it.

41:46.770 --> 41:48.965
Yes... we did.

41:49.139 --> 41:52.336
A celebration is in order.

41:52.409 --> 41:57.870
How about listening to that
opera you promised me?

41:57.948 --> 41:59.472
Oh, you're, uh...

41:59.550 --> 42:03.680
still wrestling with
your ethical subroutines.

42:03.787 --> 42:05.254
Take my advice.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.280
lt's a waste of time.

42:07.358 --> 42:11.351
What's important is that
we saved two lives today.

42:11.428 --> 42:13.896
l'm not concerned with today.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.898
lt's tomorrow l'm worried about.

42:17.001 --> 42:20.061
Captain Janeway has left
your future in my hands.

42:20.170 --> 42:21.159
She believes that,

42:21.272 --> 42:23.263
as Voyager's
Chief Medical Officer,

42:23.374 --> 42:24.898
it's up to me to decide

42:25.042 --> 42:28.205
whether your program
remains in our database.

42:28.279 --> 42:34.081
Personally, l predict a long
and fruitful collaboration

42:34.151 --> 42:35.209
between us.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.548
Oh?

42:36.620 --> 42:41.580
Think about what we accomplished
in the last 24 hours.

42:41.659 --> 42:44.389
Our first case was a triumph.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.725
Both patients are thriving

42:46.797 --> 42:51.063
and we advanced the frontiers
of medical science.

42:51.168 --> 42:53.728
l've already outlined a paper

42:53.837 --> 42:56.829
that you and l
will one day present

42:56.941 --> 42:59.409
to the Federation
Medical Academy:

42:59.510 --> 43:04.277
''Total Systemic lnvasion
of a Klingon-human Hybrid

43:04.381 --> 43:07.350
By a Cytoplasmic
Pseudo-parasite.''

43:07.384 --> 43:10.376
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

43:11.789 --> 43:13.484
Are we also going to tell them

43:13.557 --> 43:15.855
where you honed
your surgical techniques?

43:15.926 --> 43:17.860
A footnote, perhaps--

43:17.928 --> 43:22.365
''For further details,
see Cardassian death camps.''

43:22.433 --> 43:24.628
Those techniques
were crucial this morning.

43:24.735 --> 43:26.066
Where was your sarcasm then?

43:26.170 --> 43:29.196
l didn't come here to debate
the issue with you, Crell.

43:29.306 --> 43:32.935
l came here to inform you
of my decision.

43:33.077 --> 43:36.843
''lt is my judgment that
the Medical Consultant Program

43:36.914 --> 43:39.747
''and all the algorithms
contained therein

43:39.817 --> 43:42.308
''shall be deleted
from the database.

43:42.386 --> 43:45.253
''ln light of recent evidence,

43:45.322 --> 43:48.485
''l cannot in good conscience
utilize research

43:48.559 --> 43:52.552
that was derived
from such inhuman practices.''

43:52.630 --> 43:55.190
''ln good conscience''?

43:55.265 --> 43:57.563
What about the well-being
of your crew?

43:57.668 --> 44:00.603
You're confronted by
new forms of life every day--

44:00.704 --> 44:02.103
many of them dangerous.

44:02.172 --> 44:04.140
You need me.

44:04.241 --> 44:05.606
Delete my program

44:05.676 --> 44:09.874
and you violate the first oath
you took as a physician:

44:10.014 --> 44:12.847
''Do no harm.''

44:12.916 --> 44:17.785
''Do no harm...'' you have
no right to say those words.

44:17.855 --> 44:19.482
Computer...

44:19.556 --> 44:21.524
You can erase my program,
Doctor,

44:21.592 --> 44:23.617
but you can never
change the fact

44:23.694 --> 44:26.857
that you've already used
some of my research.

44:28.365 --> 44:32.324
Where was your conscience
when B'Elanna was dying

44:32.403 --> 44:34.894
on that table?

44:35.072 --> 44:38.064
Ethics? Morality?

44:38.175 --> 44:39.938
Conscience?

44:40.077 --> 44:42.910
Funny how they all go
out the airlock

44:42.980 --> 44:44.845
when we need something.

44:48.752 --> 44:51.949
Are you and l
really so different?

44:55.459 --> 44:59.896
Computer, delete
Medical Consultant Program

44:59.963 --> 45:01.692
and all related files.
