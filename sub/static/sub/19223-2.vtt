WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.038
- I just feel like the office
could be friendlier,

00:04.072 --> 00:05.539
which is why I think
wearing nametags

00:05.573 --> 00:08.109
with your favorite movie on them
is actually a great idea.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.378
Ooh, did I tell you I think
I found an apartment?

00:10.411 --> 00:12.046
- You promised me
that we were going to

00:12.080 --> 00:14.248
stand in awkward silence.
- You're funny.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.650
It's in this up-and-coming
neighborhood called Mu-To.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.751
Cute, right?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.553
- Mu-To is short
for Murder Town.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.656
- Aww, so that's why
the kitchen had drains in it.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.592
Oh, finally. I hope
these are worth the wait.

00:24.625 --> 00:28.662
Hi, I'll have two bear claws,
a chocolate scone--

00:28.696 --> 00:30.431
[maniacal laughing]

00:30.464 --> 00:33.434
[epic music]

00:33.467 --> 00:37.205
*

00:37.238 --> 00:39.140
[commotion,
people shouting]

00:39.173 --> 00:42.310
- Special delivery!

00:42.343 --> 00:44.312
[laughing]

00:45.846 --> 00:47.415
[all exclaim]

00:47.448 --> 00:49.150
Nailed it!

00:49.183 --> 00:50.851
[siren wailing distantly]

00:50.884 --> 00:52.753
- We're out of everything.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.489
- Oh.

00:55.523 --> 00:58.492
[heroic music]

00:58.526 --> 01:05.465
*

01:27.888 --> 01:29.790
- Oh, here's something cute
in East Charm City.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.459
- Oh, near the cute
insane asylum?

01:31.492 --> 01:33.194
- Or near the cute, abandoned
mannequin factory

01:33.227 --> 01:34.762
where all the pedophiles live?
- [sighs] I have to

01:34.795 --> 01:36.730
increase my price range.
- Mm-hmm.

01:36.764 --> 01:41.169
- Anyone else stay in a hotel
carved out of ice this weekend?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.137
- Mm, I slept on
a pile of clothes

01:43.171 --> 01:45.606
at my weed dealer's mom's place.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.874
- Harrowing.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.342
Anyway, I was in Iceland,

01:48.376 --> 01:50.244
at the Wayne Industries
managers retreat.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.812
- You were in Greenland.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.381
- There was a lot of ice.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.483
Anyway, our division has made
a lot of noise

01:55.516 --> 01:58.386
because this one has
whipped you all into shape.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.321
- [imitates whip cracking]
- Ooh.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.622
- I don't need to tell you
why you shouldn't--

02:01.655 --> 02:02.756
- I regretted it
immediately.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.825
- Hmm.
- They are green-lighting

02:04.858 --> 02:06.860
your anti-rubble umbrella.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.762
- That's amazing!
[all exclaiming]

02:08.795 --> 02:10.531
- Bah!
Nooo!

02:10.564 --> 02:11.699
[laughter, chatter]

02:11.732 --> 02:12.833
- The Rumbrella.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.835
Strong, stylish,
lightweight.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.637
- Just like you, Teddy.
- Thank you.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.840
- That's fantastic. We will have
it done by the end of the week.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.375
Corporate's gonna be like...
- Oh--

02:21.409 --> 02:24.345
- "What? Who's this squad
of bad asses?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.514
Let's give them more projects."

02:26.547 --> 02:28.516
- Or we could pick
a reasonable timeframe

02:28.549 --> 02:30.518
and Corporate's gonna be like,
"What? Who's the squad

02:30.551 --> 02:32.386
"of sensible individuals
who know how to achieve

02:32.420 --> 02:34.388
a work/life balance?"
- Yeah, yeah.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.524
- What?
I like Emily's idea better.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.293
Get crackin'.
Or as they say in Iceland,

02:39.327 --> 02:41.629
[speaking "Icelandic"]

02:43.831 --> 02:46.900
- What does that mean?
- "Sir, please don't urinate

02:46.934 --> 02:48.969
in the thermal hot springs."

02:49.002 --> 02:52.573
- I only remember it
'cause I heard it a lot.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.243
No one tells a Wayne
where to pee.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.710
[laughter, chatter]

02:56.744 --> 02:58.446
- Yeah, but isn't it funny?

02:58.479 --> 02:59.913
- [laughs]

02:59.947 --> 03:01.949
They look like
they're having fun.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.285
Hey, do you think they'd wanna
go--I don't know--

03:04.318 --> 03:05.853
bowling or something
Friday night?

03:05.886 --> 03:06.954
- Definitely.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.656
Oh, with you? No.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.324
- Okay, I know you're joking.
- I'm not joking.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.925
- But I'm still new in town.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.362
I mean, I work all the time.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.963
It can get kinda lonely,
you know?

03:15.996 --> 03:17.798
- Listen, you seem like
a nice person

03:17.831 --> 03:19.433
but you're also their boss,

03:19.467 --> 03:21.402
and a boss can't be friends
with their employees.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.505
- Well this boss can.
[chuckles]

03:25.773 --> 03:28.442
- And here we go, here we go.
- [murmuring]

03:28.476 --> 03:30.711
- All right, I laid out
the schedule for the Rumbrella.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.481
It's ambitious, but we're not
afraid of a little hard work.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.983
- Fuh-fuh-Fantasy
Superhero League update.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.652
- All right, hold that thought.
- If you've got the top pick,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.588
I'd shy away from Superman.
- Mm.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.990
- Sure, Supes can save an
entire building full of people,

03:43.023 --> 03:45.459
but some weeks
he only saves Lois Lane.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.328
And that's just one point.
- That's a fact.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.797
- Didn't Teddy pick him
with his first pick last year?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.999
Oh, I know he did.
That was a rhetorical question.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.467
Suck it, Teddy!
- Oh!

03:53.501 --> 03:55.002
- Hey, I will suck nothing.
All right?

03:55.035 --> 03:56.036
It was the right pick
at the time.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.037
- Oh, yeah. The right pick

03:57.070 --> 03:58.772
if you want to come in last.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.441
Like a bitch!
- Ooh!

04:00.474 --> 04:02.676
- Yeah!
- Oh, fantasy league, huh?

04:02.710 --> 04:05.413
Sounds like my kind of fun.
Mixing it up with some friends.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.881
Fair warning: [singsong]
I can bring the trash talk.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.285
You do not want me coming
for you on a group e-mail.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.688
- Sorry. League's full.

04:14.722 --> 04:18.358
- Oh. Well, I am
super busy anyways.

04:18.392 --> 04:23.030
Otherwise, I would bring it...
like a bitch!

04:23.063 --> 04:25.032
- Did you just
call yourself a bitch?

04:25.065 --> 04:27.635
- I am better over e-mail.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.738
Let's see where we're at
on the Rumbrella.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.773
- Okay, so there's a massive
super battle above,

04:32.806 --> 04:36.610
but fortunately, our customer
is holding her Rumbrella.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.779
- In my mind,
it's my sweet grandma.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.981
And she's bringing me soup.
- Nice touch.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.517
- Mm.
- Rubble starts to fall and--

04:43.551 --> 04:44.918
[buzzer blares]

04:44.952 --> 04:46.286
[crack]

04:47.555 --> 04:48.522
- [shrilly] No!

04:48.556 --> 04:49.657
Grandma!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.793
- Ooh, looks like we're gonna be
working late tonight.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.828
[lightly tense music]

04:54.862 --> 04:58.065
Doesn't mean we can't have fun.
Should we order pizza?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.467
- [sighs]

04:59.500 --> 05:02.870
- Jackie, what is wrong
with this picture?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.738
- There are no women
or minorities?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.006
- Be serious!

05:06.039 --> 05:09.443
What is wrong is I am missing.
You can only see my shoulder.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.545
How did you let this happen?
- I wasn't there

05:11.579 --> 05:13.681
when the photo was taken, Van,
because you forgot

05:13.714 --> 05:17.050
your ivory cufflinks
and made me fly 3,000 miles

05:17.084 --> 05:18.852
to go and get them.
- Oh, so I'm supposed to

05:18.886 --> 05:21.054
wear the gold ones two days
in a row like some kind of

05:21.088 --> 05:22.756
certified
pre-owned car salesman?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.958
You know what?
Maybe I ask too much of you.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.594
- I agree.
- Maybe if I want

05:26.627 --> 05:29.129
something done right,
I should just do it myself.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.699
- I'd love that.
- I'm trying to say

05:31.732 --> 05:34.402
you are incompet--you don't even
feel shame properly.

05:34.435 --> 05:37.838
- Didn't make the Dream Team,
huh, Van?

05:37.871 --> 05:38.906
- Hello, Samuel.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.708
And you know that I did.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.876
That--

05:42.910 --> 05:45.379
that is my shoulder.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.848
- Really?
Well, that's my face.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.884
See, usually people prefer
to have those in pictures.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.121
Which is why I'm on Facebook
and not Shoulderbook.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.589
- Ha ha ha.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.690
- Hey, Van.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.692
How come you're not
in that photo?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.661
- Oh. I like her.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.464
Samuel Greene.
Head of Human Resources.

06:03.497 --> 06:07.601
And fully visible member
of the Wayne Dream Team.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.937
If you need anything at all,
you let me know.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.739
- Mm-mm.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.442
Well, he seems nice.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.477
- So do chimps.
Until you dress them up

06:16.510 --> 06:18.011
and have them perform
"12 Angry Men"

06:18.045 --> 06:19.813
for your Yale buddies.

06:21.081 --> 06:24.017
- Yes, that happened.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.819
[buzzer blares]

06:25.853 --> 06:26.820
[crack]

06:28.656 --> 06:30.624
- Guys, I can't stress enough
the importance

06:30.658 --> 06:32.760
of peoples' heads remaining
attached to their bodies.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.563
- Fuh-fuh-Fantasy
Superhero League--

06:35.596 --> 06:38.065
- Have you just been playing
that fantasy site?

06:38.098 --> 06:39.767
- Emily, we're creative people.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.902
We can't just grind away
for 15 hours straight.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.704
- I totally get that
you have a process,

06:43.737 --> 06:45.806
but Corporate said they need
this done by Friday.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.641
- No, you said you need it
done by Friday,

06:47.675 --> 06:49.042
which makes me think you don't
fully understand

06:49.076 --> 06:50.611
the meaning of the word need.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.846
- It's like when I say
I need to own a pet shark.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.215
I don't need one.
I just really want one.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.917
- Emily don't worry
about it, okay?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.052
We're gonna finish this.
We know how to manage our time.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.654
- [slurping]

07:00.688 --> 07:02.923
- Fuh-fuh-Fantasy
Superhero League update.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.558
[all exclaiming]

07:04.592 --> 07:06.627
- I think I'm gonna go
with the Flash this year.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.061
- You always wanna go
with the Flash.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.797
- You always go with the Flash.
- You know, he's sleek.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.599
- We can't even see
what he's doing.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.800
- That's the point of it.
- Why won't they listen?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.468
There has to be a way
to motivate them.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.869
[laughter]

07:15.903 --> 07:18.238
- There is.
It's called being a dick.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.674
[laughter, chatter]

07:20.708 --> 07:22.510
- Yeah, but then
they'll hate me.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.612
- What would that look like?
Any different than this?

07:24.645 --> 07:26.547
- Look, I'm sure
you look at me and think,

07:26.580 --> 07:27.981
"She probably has
a million friends."

07:28.015 --> 07:30.618
- No. Not once. Not ever.
I never thought that.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.620
- The other day, I took
the elevator up and down,

07:32.653 --> 07:34.021
just trying to meet people.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.557
- Oh, my gosh.
That's so sad.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.692
There any footage of that?

07:38.726 --> 07:41.962
Look, you're the boss.
You've gotta be the bad guy.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.664
- [sighs]
- Susan?

07:45.566 --> 07:48.936
Little pin-up of some
beach bunnies, eh?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.203
Inappropriate.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.905
- That's just my daughter's
swim team.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.508
- Makes for an uncomfortable
work environment.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.009
Get rid of it.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.013
- If you want people
to do what you say,

08:00.047 --> 08:01.715
you've gotta be the bad guy.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.518
- [sighs]

08:04.552 --> 08:07.087
Or someone does.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.257
What's your policy on people
using company computers

08:10.290 --> 08:12.025
to play
Superhero Fantasy League?

08:12.059 --> 08:15.863
- Usually we turn a blind eye,
unless it's causing a problem.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.866
- What if it is
causing a problem?

08:18.899 --> 08:22.703
- Then things get fun.
- Mm.

08:25.773 --> 08:30.043
- Van, I think I know how
to fix the photo situation.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.178
- Already done.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.746
I am solving this in a way

08:33.780 --> 08:36.817
that your little mind
couldn't possibly comprehend.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.818
- You're taking a picture
of yourself to Photoshop it

08:38.852 --> 08:40.688
into the picture of
the Dream Team,

08:40.721 --> 08:43.890
and then you're gonna mount that
in the lobby instead.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.893
- Oh.
- Van, please let me help you

08:45.926 --> 08:48.028
before you do something
very stupid.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.196
- Too late!

08:49.229 --> 08:50.631
It's already done.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.032
Jackie, I know what I'm doing.

08:52.065 --> 08:56.169
My daddy didn't have
someone else raise a dummy.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.305
- Come on, come on.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.142
- Hey, guys. How goes it?

09:02.175 --> 09:03.944
- The fantasy site's
not loading.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.145
Ron, can you get on?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.947
- No. It's blocked!

09:06.980 --> 09:09.783
- Blocked? You sure?
Let me check.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.052
[video game-like music plays]
- No Wayne, Jose!

09:12.085 --> 09:13.921
- Dang! Dang it to hell.
- No Wayne, Jose!

09:13.954 --> 09:14.855
- Me, too!

09:14.888 --> 09:17.658
- Guys, I was watching
that sad YouTube video

09:17.691 --> 09:19.760
of Emily going up and down
in the elevator

09:19.793 --> 09:22.763
when that vaguely racist cartoon
bandit came on my screen.

09:22.796 --> 09:25.198
- What? No, it's just
the fantasy site, right?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.868
- The entire Internet's gone!

09:27.901 --> 09:30.804
[dramatic music]

09:30.838 --> 09:32.239
- I'll check Susan's computer.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.207
Move it, Susan!

09:34.241 --> 09:36.944
- My God.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.312
The only site
we can get on is LinkedIn.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.682
- What monster did this to us?

09:41.715 --> 09:44.852
- I know who did this.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.955
- Guys, I'm sorry...
- It was HR.

09:47.988 --> 09:51.692
[glass shatters]
- ...That HR did this to you!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.694
Man, this is a real bummer.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.697
Dang! Well, guess we might as
well get back to work.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.099
- Or we could figure out
how to get the Internet back.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.802
I mean, we're engineers.
This is what we're paid to do.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.637
- Yeah.
- Actually, you're paid--

10:03.671 --> 10:04.838
- Yeah! No, no, no.
Don't worry.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.206
We're gonna put
everything else aside

10:06.239 --> 10:07.374
until we figure this out.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.109
- [sighs]

10:09.142 --> 10:11.044
- Emily, get in here!

10:11.078 --> 10:12.946
- Come on!

10:12.980 --> 10:15.382
- So I think there was some sort
of miscommunication.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.384
I just wanted
the fantasy site blocked.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.652
Now they're spending
all their time

10:18.686 --> 10:19.787
trying to get the Internet back.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.889
So if you could
just put it back.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.726
- Emily...[ahem]
What do you think HR does?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.928
- Oh, well, you know,
it's--

10:27.961 --> 10:31.198
HR does the--
It's human resources and--

10:31.231 --> 10:33.266
- You have no idea.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.003
And neither does anyone else.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.938
So the only way for me
to keep my job

10:37.971 --> 10:40.273
is if Corporate sees me
doing something.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.075
- Okay, but come on.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.343
Taking away the whole Internet

10:43.376 --> 10:44.912
seems a little unreasonable.

10:44.945 --> 10:49.049
- That--that's very aggressive
language, Emily.

10:49.082 --> 10:53.086
You're flirting with a six-hour
anti-bullying video.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.454
- Well--
- Oh, did...

10:54.487 --> 10:56.089
did you wanna say something?

10:56.123 --> 10:57.324
No?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.159
Didn't think so.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.895
[edgy music]

11:01.929 --> 11:03.764
- [sighs]

11:03.797 --> 11:05.432
- All right,
this will cut off

11:05.465 --> 11:07.701
the heating,
air conditioning and sewage,

11:07.735 --> 11:09.937
but it might get us
our Internet back.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.304
- Do it.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.774
[electricity fizzles,
power down hum]

11:13.807 --> 11:17.144
[workers murmuring]
[video game-like music]

11:17.177 --> 11:18.445
- No!
- Aw, man!

11:18.478 --> 11:21.314
I should have peed first.
- Mm.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.851
- Hey, what are you doing
coming from HR?

11:23.884 --> 11:26.053
[lightly suspenseful music]
- Uh...

11:26.086 --> 11:28.288
- Oh. [laughs] Were you making
that whipping noise

11:28.321 --> 11:29.422
to other black people?

11:29.456 --> 11:33.326
- No. I was just...

11:33.360 --> 11:36.196
trying to get
the Internet back...

11:36.229 --> 11:39.800
for you guys because I knew
you wanted it so bad.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.334
- What?
- You did that for us?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.970
I mean,
nobody screws with Samuel.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.938
I mean, to be honest,
Ron even thought for a second

11:44.972 --> 11:46.874
that you were the reason
the Internet was shut down.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.209
- [forced laugh]
Ron.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.011
- Yeah, I had you all wrong.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.913
And I try not to use
the word hero

11:52.946 --> 11:54.815
outside of a sandwich
context...

11:54.848 --> 11:56.349
but you just might be one.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.919
- You know, we were being
a little tough on you earlier.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.954
What do you say about
joining our fantasy league?

12:00.988 --> 12:02.890
- Well, I thought you said
it was full.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.224
- Susan, you're out!
And don't gimme

12:04.257 --> 12:06.093
that look, Susan--
you knew this was coming.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.495
- Guys, let's get back to work
on that Rumbrella.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.764
For Emily.
You wanted it by Friday?

12:10.798 --> 12:13.066
- Did I say that?
I don't even remember.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.301
- I think you said Monday.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.368
- Friday.
Definitely Friday.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.070
I think. Whatever.
[laughs]

12:18.338 --> 12:19.506
- Beautiful.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.208
- You don't think
the finger guns

12:21.241 --> 12:22.342
are a little much?

12:22.375 --> 12:25.078
- Hey Van!
both: Pew, pew, pew.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.015
- Hey!
[imitates machine gun]

12:28.048 --> 12:29.983
[laughs] You tell me.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.852
Know what the best part is?
- Yes, I do.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.286
But what do you think it is?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.955
- I did this on my own.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.190
I personally told
the art department to do this

12:37.224 --> 12:39.559
[elevator bell dings]
for me, all by myself.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.361
- So instead of
withstanding rubble,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.196
the Rumbrella needs to repel--

12:43.230 --> 12:45.132
[light music]

12:45.165 --> 12:47.134
Did Van Photoshop himself
into that?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.368
- Yes, he did.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.270
- And can we get
the photo he used?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.139
- Yes, you can.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.506
both: Hm.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.013
- Guess what?

13:00.047 --> 13:01.481
The team is back on track
to finish

13:01.514 --> 13:03.416
the Rumbrella,
and they invited me

13:03.450 --> 13:04.852
into their fantasy league.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.286
Looks like I hit that
friend/boss sweet spot.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.121
- I don't believe it.
It doesn't exist.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.123
- Discard.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.326
- Van, are we friends?
- [laughs]

13:13.360 --> 13:15.428
Bosses cannot be friends
with their employees.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.164
It is a myth,
like the Yeti...

13:17.197 --> 13:18.999
or the unconditional
love of a mother.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.433
- And he has spent
a lot of money

13:20.467 --> 13:22.169
in search of both
of those things.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.038
- Although I am making progress
on the Yeti.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.040
- Oh, there he is!
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

13:27.074 --> 13:30.477
- Ah!
[all imitating gunfire]

13:30.510 --> 13:32.612
- Yeah! Yeah, man.
- Boom, boom!

13:32.645 --> 13:34.547
Ooh hoo hoo!

13:34.581 --> 13:36.016
- What's with the finger guns?

13:36.049 --> 13:37.450
- Oh, you don't know.
- Mm-mm.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.451
- You're gonna love this.
- Okay.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.486
- Follow me.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.021
Now that I'm a fully visible

13:41.054 --> 13:42.322
member of the Dream Team,

13:42.355 --> 13:44.291
everyone is giving me props--

13:44.324 --> 13:47.127
[dramatic stings]

13:47.160 --> 13:51.331
*

13:51.364 --> 13:53.633
What the hell is this?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.268
- You've been memed.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.904
- Hey, gunslinger.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.606
[all imitating gunfire]

14:01.108 --> 14:02.609
- What is happening here?

14:02.642 --> 14:04.377
- Samuel.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.480
Look what they've done to me.
- Van. Come on.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.349
It was just a joke.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.618
- Ooh, just a joke.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.954
Well, I have a joke
of my own.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.056
Uhh, knock, knock?

14:20.961 --> 14:21.962
- Who's there?

14:21.995 --> 14:23.663
- Really?
- Susan!

14:23.696 --> 14:26.566
- A six-hour
anti-bullying video

14:26.599 --> 14:28.068
you'll all be
watching this weekend

14:28.101 --> 14:30.137
because I have just
written you up.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.372
[all exclaiming]
- No, no, no, no.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.407
- You are being ridiculous.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.343
[edgy notes]

14:36.376 --> 14:39.379
- You mean as ridiculous as you
asking me to stop them from

14:39.412 --> 14:41.548
playing their fantasy league?
- Shh! Shh!

14:41.581 --> 14:44.051
- Wait, what?
- What?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.986
- What's he talking about?
- [sighs] Guys,

14:46.019 --> 14:48.255
let's be honest,
we were bullying.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.390
We need to just take our
punishment and walk away

14:50.423 --> 14:52.292
and not listen to anything else
anyone says.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.261
- Emily betrayed you.
[workers murmuring]

14:54.294 --> 14:57.397
I didn't take away
your Internet for no reason.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.565
She asked me to.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.267
[gasps, murmurs]

15:00.300 --> 15:02.502
[edgy music]

15:02.535 --> 15:04.604
- I'm just gonna go
ride the elevator up and down

15:04.637 --> 15:06.239
for a while.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.509
*

15:09.542 --> 15:13.246
- And with the tenth pick
in the longest draft ever

15:13.280 --> 15:15.448
because Emily had
our Internet taken away--

15:15.482 --> 15:16.683
Susan.
- Thanks, guys.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.418
I really appreciate
you letting me back in--

15:18.451 --> 15:21.021
- Enough, Susan. You're only
here so we can kick out Emily.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.222
- Guys, I'm sorry.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.490
I should have been
straight with you

15:23.523 --> 15:25.125
from the beginning,
instead of going to HR.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.593
Are we cool?
- Uh, no.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.228
We're the opposite of cool.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.630
- You're on the very short list
of things that upset me.

15:30.663 --> 15:34.567
It's you and the shockingly
high price of shark ownership.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.969
- It's not all my fault.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.337
I wouldn't have done
what I did

15:37.370 --> 15:39.139
if you guys would have just
finished the Rumbrella,

15:39.172 --> 15:41.208
which is--I don't know--
your job.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.176
- And we said we would do it.
- Yeah.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.078
- We bitch and we procrastinate
because that's what we do.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.313
But we would've gotten it done

15:46.346 --> 15:47.647
at the absolute
last possible minute.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.216
- You said you had our backs.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.318
But then you went
behind our backs.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.586
- Yeah, just like
all our other bosses.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.455
Except for
"I Think I Can Fly" Tom.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.990
He never had the chance.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.725
- Relax, Emily.
We'll get it done by Friday.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.428
You'll look great.
Corporate will love you.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.196
- [sighs]

16:03.230 --> 16:04.697
- I swear to God,
if I open my eyes

16:04.731 --> 16:06.333
and you are wearing
that "Scream" mask,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.168
I am going to
literally piss myself.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.137
- Just open your eyes, Van.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.441
- Ha! I told you I was there.
I knew it!

16:14.474 --> 16:16.143
- The photographer
cropped you out

16:16.176 --> 16:17.677
because
you were being a dick.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.212
So I told him you were dying

16:19.246 --> 16:21.748
and I needed this
for your funeral.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.350
- My God.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.218
Did the doctor say
how long I have?

16:25.252 --> 16:27.220
- If you never give me
another raise,

16:27.254 --> 16:29.756
your face right now
is payment enough.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.392
- You must feel
so smug right now,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.394
that you handled this
when I couldn't.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.432
- [imitating gunshots]

16:39.466 --> 16:41.634
[light music]

16:41.668 --> 16:43.403
- That's not how they work.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.107
- It's rubble time!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.475
- Are you ready, Emily?
"Sorry, I'm too busy

16:48.508 --> 16:50.077
"narcing on my friends
because I think

16:50.110 --> 16:51.411
I'm better than everybody."

16:51.444 --> 16:53.513
- You're not better
than everybody, Emily!

16:53.546 --> 16:54.514
[screams]

16:54.547 --> 16:57.084
- [clears throat]

16:57.117 --> 16:58.785
- I'm sorry.
Please don't write me up.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.620
I've been working really hard.

17:00.653 --> 17:04.257
- I'm here to inform you
that the Internet is back on

17:04.290 --> 17:06.659
and you don't have to watch
the anti-bullying video.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.794
- What happened?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.230
- I'm not at liberty to say.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.333
I see that
open-toed shoe, Susan.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.734
This is a place of business.
We're not in the club.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.470
- So if I do this,

17:17.503 --> 17:19.439
none of them have to
sit through it, right?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.441
- As long as the six-hour
anti-bullying video

17:21.473 --> 17:24.077
gets watched four times,
my quota is filled.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.512
- It can't be that bad.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.780
- Oh, I've seen it break
NAVY SEALs.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.650
There's a 75-minute song
about name calling

17:30.683 --> 17:32.452
performed by a puppet.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.421
Enjoy.
[orchestral music]

17:34.454 --> 17:37.424
*

17:37.457 --> 17:38.525
- [sighs]

17:41.528 --> 17:45.298
- Hi, I am recovering
super villain Prince Evillo.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.367
I know, I know.
The name.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.303
Anyway, I am required
to talk to you...

17:50.337 --> 17:52.339
- [yawns]
- About bullying.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.641
What? I am doing it!

17:54.674 --> 17:59.312
So remember what
R-E-S-P-E-C-T spells out.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.449
The R stands for "Respect."
- R. E.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.752
- The E stands for
"Everybody better respect me."

18:05.785 --> 18:09.856
[dark music]

18:09.889 --> 18:13.593
- I don't get it. Jay Z can say
that word and I can't?

18:13.626 --> 18:14.894
- [groans]
[thud]

18:14.927 --> 18:17.197
[video soundtrack continues]

18:17.230 --> 18:18.731
- Oh, she's been doing this
for 24 hours?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.800
- She told me not to tell you,
and I wasn't going to,

18:20.833 --> 18:22.302
but then she started twitching.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.637
all: Ooh!
- Yep. There it is.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.339
- Uh-oh. Let's get her
out of there.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.340
- Ooh.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.342
- * If a bully's
being mean-- *

18:29.376 --> 18:31.478
- * I'll always intervene

18:31.511 --> 18:33.346
* 'Cause being kind
and friendly's *

18:33.380 --> 18:35.615
* Part of my daily routine

18:35.648 --> 18:38.385
- Hey, it's over.
You're safe now.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.220
- Thank you for taking
that bullet for us.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.421
- Least I could do.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.456
I'm sorry
I screwed everything up.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.158
I was trying to be a boss
and a friend,

18:45.192 --> 18:46.859
but I guess I ended up
being neither.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.395
- Oh, Emily.
That's not true.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.696
- Really?
- Of course.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.498
You're definitely our boss.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.600
- And definitely not our friend.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.169
- That played out differently
than I thought it was going to.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.337
- It's just that
we barely know you.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.671
- But we could get to know you.
I mean,

18:58.705 --> 19:00.373
we still haven't
finished our fantasy draft.

19:00.407 --> 19:03.276
- Fuh-fuh-Fantasy Superhero
League update.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.911
- All right, Emily.
It's the tenth pick. You're up.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.514
- Should I take Batman
or Crimson Fox?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.616
I met Crimson Fox.
- Well, you gotta go

19:09.649 --> 19:12.285
with who you met.
- Everyone knows that.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.488
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Crimson Fox.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.723
[laughter]
- So dumb!

19:16.756 --> 19:19.192
- Not even Crimson Fox
would pick Crimson Fox.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.494
- Well I bet your grandma would.
- What does that even mean?

19:21.528 --> 19:23.930
- I don't know.
[laughter]

19:23.963 --> 19:27.800
- Jackie, I just realized I left
those cufflinks in Greenland.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.769
I need you to hop on a redeye
and have them back

19:29.802 --> 19:31.571
in time for
my dinner tomorrow night.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.773
- Do you mean these cufflinks?

19:33.806 --> 19:35.675
- Thank you!

19:35.708 --> 19:37.710
Didn't...polish them.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.849
[light music]

19:42.882 --> 19:44.717
*

19:44.751 --> 19:46.553
- Totally different cufflinks.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.289
- I can't believe you've put up
with him all these years.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.757
- He always remembers
my birthday,

19:50.790 --> 19:54.361
he got my really dumb kid
into a really good school,

19:54.394 --> 19:56.963
and when my dog needed
super-expensive surgery,

19:56.996 --> 20:01.534
he paid for a guy to come
to my house and put him down.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.804
- Well, that's...sweet.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.639
- So...

20:06.673 --> 20:08.708
let's take a look at that
finished Rumbrella.

20:08.741 --> 20:12.679
*

20:12.712 --> 20:14.714
- All right, Ron's grandma
is rolling down the street.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.349
The Flash--
my number one pick--

20:16.383 --> 20:17.884
throws Professor Zoom
into a building

20:17.917 --> 20:20.987
because the Flash is the man.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.723
And...this happens.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.492
[buzzer blares]

20:25.525 --> 20:27.760
[boulders crashing,
thudding]

20:29.996 --> 20:31.798
- It works!

20:31.831 --> 20:36.002
I mean, obviously it works
because these guys are the best.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.670
- The rubble bounces off,
but it destroys

20:37.704 --> 20:39.739
everyone around it.
- Ah, ah, ah.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.709
Not if they
have Rumbrellas too.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.479
- Everyone has to have one.
Ooh!

20:46.513 --> 20:49.516
The Rumbrella taketh
but, boy, does it giveth!

20:50.650 --> 20:51.751
[all exclaiming]

20:51.784 --> 20:54.487
- Breaking news.
- Oh, hey guys, check this out.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.789
- Super villain Sinestro
just imprisoned

20:56.823 --> 20:59.359
the Flash
in the Phantom Zone.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.060
So it looks like
the Scarlet Speedster's

21:01.093 --> 21:02.495
gonna be out all year.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.464
- Ohh!
- Hey, Teddy, didn't you

21:04.497 --> 21:06.633
pick the Flash,
like a bitch?

21:06.666 --> 21:08.901
- Ooh! Damn, girl!
[laughter]

21:08.935 --> 21:11.371
- And in a shocking turn
of events,

21:11.404 --> 21:13.506
Crimson Fox just saved
an entire cruise ship.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.375
- What?
- So if you were crazy enough

21:15.408 --> 21:17.577
to take her, ha, you're feeling
pretty good about yourself.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.647
- Ohh! Snap!
I own all of you.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.816
- I don't need to to tell you--
- Yep, immediately regretted it.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.418
- Ha. That's funny.
