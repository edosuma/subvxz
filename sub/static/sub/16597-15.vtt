WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:05.139
So, you doing anything
fun tonight?

00:05.173 --> 00:07.241
I'm going to Eric's.
He's making dinner.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.409
Ooh, is he a good cook?

00:08.442 --> 00:10.711
Nope.
That's why I'm eating
three tacos

00:10.744 --> 00:13.114
in the car
on the way over there.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.716
Hey, speaking of which,
don't you usually eat lunch

00:15.749 --> 00:18.552
with Dr. Ken on Tuesdays
and help him with
his charting?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.588
Not since Allison
started working here.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.590
Now they eat lunch
and chart together.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.558
It's adorable.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.893
Thank you, Allison.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.196
That lunch was off...
the charts.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.397
(LAUGHS)

00:29.430 --> 00:30.864
Charting together.
Double meaning.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.234
That's why it's funny.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.302
PAT: Listen up, people.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.969
I just got off the phone
with a producer

00:36.003 --> 00:37.037
from The Learning Network.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.906
They're making
a documentary series

00:38.939 --> 00:41.475
called American Healthcare,
and they want to film

00:41.509 --> 00:44.545
a typical day in an HMO
as seen through the eyes of
a doctor...

00:44.578 --> 00:46.447
Oh, my God.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.382
...highlighting
the inner workings

00:48.416 --> 00:51.051
of managed care at Welltopia,
and they've selected

00:51.085 --> 00:53.053
the doctor they intend
to focus on.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.556
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.891
And it is our own Dr. Park.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.893
Ohh, my God!

01:00.928 --> 01:02.963
I said yes because,
well, you know,

01:02.996 --> 01:05.166
Dr. Park always behaves
as if he's on...

01:05.199 --> 01:07.335
some sort of a show, anyway.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.804
And it's great exposure
for Welltopia.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.374
The director will be here
first thing Monday with
her film crew.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.842
Oh, no, not Monday.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.211
Why not Monday?
It's my birthday!

01:18.446 --> 01:19.980
Ohh!

01:20.013 --> 01:21.582
This is too much!

01:21.615 --> 01:23.651
Bear in mind
they will want to speak

01:23.684 --> 01:25.052
to the rest of us, as well.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.688
Yeah, but I'm the lead.
(CHUCKLES)

01:27.721 --> 01:28.922
And who can blame them?

01:28.956 --> 01:30.624
I'm a natural entertainer,
(MUMBLING) unlike

01:30.658 --> 01:32.893
some people over here...
(CHUCKLES)

01:32.926 --> 01:34.094
...who gets
a little stiff and awkward

01:34.128 --> 01:35.163
in front of the camera.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.464
Oh, you should see
our wedding video.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.132
It was like I married
the Tin Man.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.235
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oil can.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.836
Oil can.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

01:42.870 --> 01:43.971
I do!

01:45.373 --> 01:49.477
It's a shame because
what I was trying to say is,
"I don't."

01:49.510 --> 01:51.979
Anyway, since we all
will be on camera,

01:52.012 --> 01:54.248
everyone needs to be
at their best

01:54.282 --> 01:56.850
to provide top-notch care
to our patients

01:56.884 --> 01:59.420
in a friendly
and efficient environment.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.822
So not a typical day
at the HMO.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.091
(LAUGHS)
Using it! (LAUGHS)

02:12.933 --> 02:15.203
PAT: You know, Welltopia's
the number one HMO

02:15.236 --> 02:17.938
in the San Fernando Valley
according to a recent survey.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.240
Really?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.175
Sure.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.977
This is our friendly office
manager Damona Watkins.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.746
Excuse me!
Hey!

02:25.779 --> 02:26.980
Is that your Us Weekly?

02:27.014 --> 02:29.082
Then how did it end up
in your purse?

02:29.116 --> 02:30.518
Put it back!

02:31.919 --> 02:33.554
Transition segue.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.256
This is Clark.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.957
Hi. Hi.
Uh, hi.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.892
I'm, uh,
Clark Leslie Beavers.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.495
I've been Dr. Park's nurse
for a long time.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.364
And we are
a fantastic team,

02:43.397 --> 02:45.599
never stepping
on each other's toes...

02:45.633 --> 02:46.967
Oh, hello.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.538
I was just reading
some thank-you letters

02:50.571 --> 02:53.674
from patients whose lives
I've touched over the years.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.811
Hi, I'm Amy Thompson,
the director.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.947
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Are you ready to get started?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.315
Oh, absolutely.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.984
Um, oh, should I look
down the barrel or
camera left?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.319
Actually, my profile's
better here.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.820
It hides the chins.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.758
Oh, my, you're a whole thing,
aren't you?

03:10.791 --> 03:12.493
Why don't you just start by
introducing yourself?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.627
Okay.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.031
And...action.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.534
Hi, I'm Dr. Ken Park,
family medicine physician.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.836
I have about 1,000 patients
in my practice,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.171
and I'm a partner here
at Welltopia.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.473
Oh, great.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.641
Uh, why don't you
tell us a little bit about
your family?

03:27.675 --> 03:30.210
Well, I've been in love
with the same woman
for over 20 years,

03:30.244 --> 03:32.145
and if my wife finds out,
she'll kill me.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.382
(LAUGHS)
I'm just kidding.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.484
No.
We're happily married.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.553
I mean, I have one beautiful
child, and a son named Dave.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.021
(LAUGHS)
Kidding again.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.222
He's adorable, too.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.857
He's just a little
condescending, that's all.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.893
He makes me
feel bad sometimes.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.028
Okay. Um, I'm...
I'm told your wife

03:48.061 --> 03:49.997
also works here
as a psychiatrist?

03:50.030 --> 03:52.433
(AS BORAT) My wife. She good.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.036
Do you need a minute?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.505
(NORMAL VOICE)
Oh, no, no, uh, Borat?

03:57.538 --> 03:58.639
Yeah, I, I've seen it.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.475
I'm just confused
as to why you're doing it.

04:01.509 --> 04:04.278
I was just trying to
thread my comedic
point of view

04:04.312 --> 04:06.046
with this
medical talking head.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.949
And we'll be right back
with American Healthcare.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.553
Uh, Dr. Park, you don't have
to try so hard

04:12.586 --> 04:13.921
to force the narrative.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.756
Just, you know,
let it happen naturally.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.992
Oh! And it's my birthday, yo!
West Side! (BARKS)

04:20.628 --> 04:22.630
Okay, uh, I don't know
what's going on

04:22.663 --> 04:25.232
with this West Side
and this comedic
point of view.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.635
It's just... Oh, sorry,
I'm also a comedian.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.903
Oh! So you're like
Patch Adams!

04:32.506 --> 04:34.975
No, I'm not a clown.
(CHUCKLES)

04:35.008 --> 04:37.210
Big difference.
(CHUCKLES)

04:37.244 --> 04:38.946
I was just pointing out
that comedy

04:38.979 --> 04:40.948
is one of many things
that makes me interesting.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.251
Okay, uh, let's just take
a little step back here, okay?

04:44.284 --> 04:47.254
This is a 10-part series about
all aspects of healthcare.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.656
We shadowed an ER doctor.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.857
We... We followed

04:49.890 --> 04:52.025
a Doctor Without Borders
to Guatemala.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.794
But we also would like to
explore the role

04:53.827 --> 04:55.329
of the primary care provider.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.598
You know, the first stop,
the gatekeeper,

04:57.631 --> 05:00.968
the everyday
side of medicine.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.571
(CHUCKLES) Well, I got to say
the way you described it

05:03.604 --> 05:04.905
makes what I do
sound pretty dull.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.875
No. Not dull.
Everyday.

05:09.843 --> 05:13.313
Sorry to disappoint, but if
you're expecting everyday,

05:13.347 --> 05:15.349
you came to
the wrong place.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.717
West Side!

05:18.085 --> 05:20.253
West Side of what?
The Valley?

05:20.287 --> 05:22.490
Uh, no, it...
it's just a bit.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.957
It's something I say.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.460
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)

05:26.494 --> 05:28.095
It's gonna be
a long day, Ben.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.637
Mr. Sampson, are you sure you
want to see a dermatologist?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.338
Um, the mole is benign.
(CHUCKLES)

05:38.372 --> 05:40.408
I'd like to hear it
from an expert.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.850
Do you, uh,
refer a lot of your
patients to specialists?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.919
Well...
Oh, my God, yes. Yeah.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.422
Specialists like to
call him Dr. Punt.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.657
I do a lot more
than just referrals.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.125
I...
Oh, yeah. Refills, too.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.427
Tons of them.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.262
Blood pressure medication,
cholesterol medication,

06:02.295 --> 06:04.932
all of your basic
everyday medications.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.301
Refill, refer, repeat.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.971
Oh, my God,
the three R's. (CHUCKLES)

06:15.308 --> 06:17.244
Before you jump to
any conclusions,

06:17.277 --> 06:18.812
we're primary care physicians.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.614
We're the front line
of medicine.

06:20.648 --> 06:23.751
And I can assure you the front
line is anything but mundane.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.119
Can you validate my parking?
Yep.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.193
I've been waiting an hour.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.028
Yes, and I'm sorry,
Mrs. Ashburn.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.864
There's a glitch in
the scheduling program.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.231
I had double bookings
all day.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.468
I'll tell you what,
you can keep that Us Weekly

06:40.501 --> 06:42.570
and pick up some In Touch's
while you're at it.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.675
(SIGHS)

06:47.708 --> 06:51.311
Hey! I didn't say
nothing about Vogue!

06:51.344 --> 06:53.881
Oh, so now you're gonna
make me check your purse.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.120
Is she chasing a patient?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.155
Huh? No!
No, no, no.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.891
She, she...
She wouldn't 'cause,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.693
you know, she's a...

07:07.661 --> 07:09.329
Oh, Dr. Park!

07:09.362 --> 07:11.131
Dr. Allison Park!

07:11.164 --> 07:13.033
I'd love to ask you
some questions.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.403
Well...

07:18.071 --> 07:19.940
Okay.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.242
Um, well, you can, uh...
You can look right at me

07:22.275 --> 07:24.277
instead of at the camera.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.982
Okay.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.785
Uh, how long have you been
working at Welltopia?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.386
(SHOUTING)
Just a few months.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.725
(NORMAL VOICE) Uh, what
should I do with my hands?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.026
Should I...

07:39.059 --> 07:40.761
(SCOFFS) No pockets.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.195
Um...

07:42.229 --> 07:44.197
I'll just put them here.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.299
Oh, that feels strange.
(CHUCKLES)

07:46.333 --> 07:48.368
I'll just clap.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.804
Uh, that...
that's not good for sound.

07:50.838 --> 07:51.872
Oh.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.776
Hey, now!
(CHUCKLES)

07:55.809 --> 07:57.377
Are you stepping
on my screen time?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.480
(GRUMBLES INDISTINCTLY)
(CHUCKLES)

08:00.514 --> 08:02.149
Well, while
I have you both here,

08:02.182 --> 08:04.685
what's your favorite thing
about working at Welltopia?

08:04.718 --> 08:07.287
Working with Ken every day.
A sweet parking spot.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.421
Oh!

08:08.455 --> 08:10.023
I want to show you a picture.
I have a picture.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.391
(LAUGHS)

08:13.160 --> 08:15.228
He's just excited
you're here.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.630
That and the fact that
it's his birthday

08:16.664 --> 08:18.632
is over-stimulating him.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.739
AMY: So, have things changed

08:25.773 --> 08:28.275
since Ken and Allison
started working together?

08:28.308 --> 08:29.543
For him?

08:30.711 --> 08:31.912
Uh, no.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.114
No, not for him.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.749
And for you?

08:37.551 --> 08:38.952
You know,
I'm not gonna lie to you, Amy.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.387
It has been an adjustment.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.757
Um, see, I was...
I was... I was like
his work wife.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.894
Um, and now that his
actual wife is working here,

08:46.927 --> 08:49.763
it's just kind of...
thrown off our rhythm.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.034
Enough negativity.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.836
Whoo. Aah!

08:57.337 --> 08:58.872
It's, uh...
It's Ken's birthday.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.741
I made him
his favorite cake carrot.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.910
I cannot wait
to surprise him with it.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.045
Oh, yeah, see, that's him.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.479
He needs me.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.282
(QUIETLY) Yeah.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.585
Yeah, he needs me.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.357
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:17.390 --> 09:20.861
That's me crushing it at
the legendary Laugh Factory.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.963
Ask anyone. I killed.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.432
One of my proudest moments.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.469
But then I realized
what's better than killing?

09:29.502 --> 09:31.104
Saving lives.

09:31.138 --> 09:35.042
Tough decision,
but I had to go lives
over laughs.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.944
And we'll be right back
with American Health...

09:36.977 --> 09:38.078
Please stop doing that.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.247
Copy that. Reset.
Back to one.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.182
Dr. Park, your next patient
is ready.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.284
Oh, we'd love to film you
with a patient, if we may.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.886
Oh, absolutely.
So, who do we have?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.721
Sonja Miller.
Oh, for (BLEEP) sake!

09:52.225 --> 09:53.493
Hey, Sonja.

09:53.526 --> 09:54.995
I can't poop.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.333
You mean you're
constipated?

10:00.367 --> 10:03.270
I ate 12 bran muffins,
and nothing happened.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.708
That's what happens
when you don't

10:07.741 --> 10:08.842
take your thyroid medication.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.978
I will prescribe you
some stool softeners,

10:11.011 --> 10:12.112
but in the meantime,

10:12.145 --> 10:14.447
you've got to take
your Synthroid every day.

10:14.481 --> 10:18.018
No, I can't poop
even when I'm taking
my stupid Synthroid.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.188
Um, this guy doesn't know
what he's talking about.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.056
I'm glad you caught it
on camera.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.862
Well, lab results
don't lie.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.931
Yeah, neither does
my empty toilet.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.270
Okay, your lab shows that you
have an under-active thyroid,

10:37.304 --> 10:40.073
which means
you're not taking your
Synthroid like you should.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.809
You're such
a know-it all?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.543
Make me me poop.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.213
We will be calling you
every day

10:46.246 --> 10:50.517
to make sure you're taking
your stupid Synthroid.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.253
Come back in two weeks,
and I promise

10:53.286 --> 10:55.522
you'll be pooping
like a champ.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.090
Okay?

10:57.124 --> 10:59.326
You're the worst doctor ever.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.796
See you in two weeks.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.898
Hi, Mom.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.804
Would you mind just...

11:12.039 --> 11:13.106
I'm sorry.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.574
Primary care is usually much
more exciting.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.377
It's okay.
I told you we aren't
looking for exciting.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.947
Well, I am. It's just that
today's a (BLEEP) show.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.348
That's all.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.150
Wait.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.385
Wait, is that camera still on?

11:34.561 --> 11:35.662
PAT: Damona.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.099
You have been acting
the grump all morning.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.968
You better check yourself
before you wreck,

11:41.001 --> 11:43.603
not only yourself,
but this entire documentary.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.273
I'm sorry.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.041
Last night I saw a text
on Eric's phone

11:48.075 --> 11:49.777
from his ex-girlfriend.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.279
It said,
"Thanks for the talk,"
and a whole bunch of

11:52.312 --> 11:54.047
XO's, XO's on it.

11:54.081 --> 11:57.050
Ah. Ah, that's not so bad.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.219
I once saw a text on my
ex-wife's phone that said,

11:59.252 --> 12:00.587
"Thanks for
not being pregnant."

12:00.620 --> 12:02.122
(BOTH LAUGH)

12:05.125 --> 12:06.593
Hey.
He, um...

12:08.128 --> 12:10.263
When I asked him about it,
he got all dismissive

12:10.297 --> 12:13.934
and, you know, jerky
and stuff, you know?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.602
Aw, come here.
Sorry for acting like a baby.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.171
Oh, yeah, come on.
You're only human.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.340
(SNIFFLES)

12:25.412 --> 12:27.214
Yep. Patients.
Work. Work.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.928
Now, what you saw
was just a, uh...

12:40.961 --> 12:43.696
That was just a friendly hug,
'cause, you know,

12:43.730 --> 12:46.233
Damona and I are...
are just friends now.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.202
So at some point,
you were more than friends?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.905
Yes.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.773
Yes, but it was all
fully documented

12:53.807 --> 12:55.809
with human resources
from the intimacies

12:55.843 --> 12:57.811
all the way down
to the zucchini muffin

12:57.845 --> 13:00.047
I would bring her
every morning.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.715
Well, is it hard to see her
with someone else?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.452
Nah, nah, nah.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.753
No, no, I mean, it's...

13:06.786 --> 13:09.222
I mean, it's hard to see
anyone hurt her feelings.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.491
You know, let's face it,
men are idiots, right?

13:11.524 --> 13:14.494
We never appreciate what
we have when we have it.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.264
Why don't we talk
about something

13:17.297 --> 13:18.866
a little more pertinent
like Welltopia's

13:18.899 --> 13:21.301
unrivaled Pap smear
success rate?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.873
I wish you guys
were here last week.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.507
I had the most amazing case.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.609
It started out
as a simple hemorrhoid,

13:29.642 --> 13:30.978
and it snowballed into...

13:31.011 --> 13:33.947
Hey! It's my kids!
(LAUGHS)

13:35.282 --> 13:37.517
This is the light of my life,
Molly.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.319
And what's your name again?
(CHUCKLES)

13:39.352 --> 13:40.687
How droll.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.190
How long
do we have to stay?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.092
You can stay
as long as you want.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.459
So we can go?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.461
(LAUGHS)
She's funny.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.830
Great, do a show
about her, then.

13:52.699 --> 13:56.036
How do you like having
a doctor/comedian for a dad?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.871
It's cool/exhausting.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.708
So, who are your influences?

14:01.741 --> 14:02.809
My influences?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.244
As a documentarian.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.146
Are you an Errol Morris fan?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.615
Or do your tastes run more
towards the Maysles Brothers?

14:09.883 --> 14:12.152
Uh, they did, uh,
Grey Gardens, right?

14:12.185 --> 14:15.956
And every other
noteworthy documentary
since the '60s, yeah.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.894
Well, I'll just have to check
out their full body of work.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.162
Only if you're inspired

14:22.195 --> 14:23.897
by the medium
you happen to work in.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.434
Are we done here?

14:29.736 --> 14:32.805
So I understand
you volunteered here at
Welltopia last fall.

14:32.839 --> 14:36.209
Yeah, I'm doing
everything I can to get
into a good college.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.912
Let's be honest.
You got to play the game.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.949
But I actually set up an
appointment-reminder program,

14:41.982 --> 14:44.417
which really streamlined
their scheduling.

14:44.451 --> 14:47.154
It's nice to be able to leave
your mark.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.991
Molly.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.361
(QUIETLY) That, uh, program
you set up... It's a disaster.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.796
(MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY)

14:56.829 --> 14:58.865
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Excuse me.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.802
I'm about to punch
this computer in the throat.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.839
Here's the problem.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.608
You can't ignore
the update alerts.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.811
You can always put this here,
and done.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.113
Oh! Oh!

15:13.146 --> 15:15.182
Oh! Thank you!

15:15.215 --> 15:17.985
Oh, you saved my ass!

15:18.018 --> 15:20.220
Well, it's just part of
leaving my mark.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.622
(WHISPERING) Psst. Amy.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.291
Amy. Molly, move.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.064
This is awesome.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.433
This woman's in so much pain.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.868
Mrs. Swenson's
been coming to me for years.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.005
Multiple medical problems...
Osteoporosis,

15:38.038 --> 15:40.407
which led to debilitating
kyphosis of her spine.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.075
So treating of her pain
is like solving

15:42.109 --> 15:43.943
a big, old,
crooked jigsaw puzzle.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.813
Hi, Mrs. Swenson.

15:46.846 --> 15:47.981
How are you feeling?

15:48.015 --> 15:50.250
You seem to be
ambulating well. Walking.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.185
Let's get you
into the exam room.

15:52.219 --> 15:55.522
Actually, I just need you
to sign this DMV form

15:55.555 --> 15:57.957
to renew my
handicapped placard.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.993
That's it?
That's it.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.495
So you sure there's nothing
else I can do for you?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.364
You can validate my parking.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.367
I don't do that.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.274
AMY: So, is being a doctor

16:14.307 --> 16:16.143
everything you thought
it would be?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.513
When I was a kid, I...

16:21.448 --> 16:22.549
I always wanted to be

16:22.582 --> 16:24.984
Hawkeye Pierce from
M-A-S-H, you know?

16:25.018 --> 16:28.455
He was, like, heroic,
saving lives, funny.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.859
But all this is... (SIGHS)

16:32.892 --> 16:35.462
Makes me realize...

16:35.495 --> 16:38.565
I-I don't know.
I'm just a medical
traffic cop.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.569
You know, I fill out forms,
I refill prescriptions,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.771
and when a case gets
remotely interesting,

16:44.804 --> 16:46.273
I punt it
to a specialist.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.476
So, no,
it's not how I pictured it.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.644
AMY: Are you happy
being a doctor?

16:58.718 --> 16:59.819
Maybe not.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.793
* Happy birthday to you

* Happy birthday, dear dad
* Happy birthday, Dr. Ken

17:39.025 --> 17:41.461

for last night.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.029
Thanks.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.964
Um, I was probably
overreacting.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.134
No, no, no, no.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.401
Kelly was getting flirty
with me,

17:48.435 --> 17:50.670
and instead of being honest
with you about it,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.340
I made it seem like
you were overreacting.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.975
That's incredibly honest
of you.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.211
So were you
flirting with her?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.480
Now, why would I do that
when I have no interest in her

18:00.513 --> 18:03.082
and found someone
so much better?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.517
(CHUCKLES)

18:05.752 --> 18:06.953
Do you want to
come to my house

18:06.986 --> 18:08.288
and watch
the Lakers game tonight?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.590
Wait, I don't think
the Lakers are
playing tonight.

You wanted to see me?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.649
Yeah.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.952
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to step on your toes
with the cake.

18:41.087 --> 18:44.424
That's okay.
I mean, you are his wife.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.526
Here's the thing.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.894
Ken wouldn't be able to
get dressed

18:47.927 --> 18:49.128
and leave the house
without me.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.098
But when he gets here,
he can't function without you,

18:52.131 --> 18:55.902
and I want you to know
how much I appreciate that.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.770
Thank you
for saying that.

talk to my wife.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.219
Yeah, you should
probably take this one.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.156
Doing this documentary
was a bad idea.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.258
What do you mean?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.826
I thought it would be
my big moment,

19:19.859 --> 19:21.994
but instead it shined a light
on how boring my job is.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.330
Ken, I don't think
the point...

19:23.363 --> 19:26.766
They're using me
in an episode about dull,
everyday doctors.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.101
I mean, this is why
I want to do comedy...

19:29.135 --> 19:30.970
because this is
so unsatisfying.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.639
Look, it's been a tough day.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.074
You wanted to prove
how fascinating your life is,

19:35.107 --> 19:38.010
and in retrospect,
it was probably too much.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.347
No, this is a sign.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.182
I should pursue comedy
full-time.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.389
He's got a pulse.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.790
He's breathing.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.024
EMTs are on their way.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.560
Good job.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.928
Yeah, you, too.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.038
That was incredible.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.773
Well,
it was a team effort.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.310
I mean, it was Clark.
It was the whole team.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.413
And, I mean, fortunately, the
patient's in stable condition,

20:46.446 --> 20:48.448
and he's gonna make
a full recovery.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.883
I got to say this is the best
birthday gift ever.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.553
So earlier, you said
you weren't happy
being a doctor.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.087
Right, I-I was frustrated.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.357
I-I mean, just like
any other job, I...

20:57.390 --> 20:59.191
Sure, some days
can be pretty routine,

20:59.225 --> 21:02.094
but every now and then,
you get that reminder

21:02.128 --> 21:04.897
of why we're all here...
It's to make a difference,

21:04.931 --> 21:07.033
and not just me...
everyone.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.169
Everyone here
makes a difference,

21:10.202 --> 21:12.739
whether it's
checking in a patient

21:12.772 --> 21:14.874
or assessing vitals or,
you know,

21:14.907 --> 21:17.109
restoring a heartbeat.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.680
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.950
AMY: So, are you happy
being a doctor?

21:25.352 --> 21:27.554
I'm exactly
where I should be.
