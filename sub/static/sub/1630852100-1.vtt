00:00.397 --> 00:03.897
(movie reel intro screen)

00:08.493 --> 00:11.410
(R&B music begins)

02:20.590 --> 02:23.447
- Everything will be just fine.

02:23.447 --> 02:24.614
- Thanks babe.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.694

02:27.694 --> 02:28.560
But we do need to get ready

02:28.560 --> 02:30.950
for your mother's 50th birthday party.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.153
Our plane leaves soon.

02:34.190 --> 02:35.023
- About that...

02:35.023 --> 02:37.663
you sure you ready to meet my family?

02:37.663 --> 02:42.663
- Yeah, I mean, how bad could it be?

02:43.468 --> 02:45.245
- All right (hesitantly).

02:45.245 --> 02:48.078
(R&B music plays)

03:04.820 --> 03:07.863
- Baby! Yo man is hungry!

03:07.863 --> 03:09.910
I'ma go over there to Joe's Rib Shack

03:09.910 --> 03:12.011
and spend yo birthday with them.

03:12.011 --> 03:14.059
- Just go on down to the Rib Shack.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.560
And you goin' miss out on greens, yams,

03:16.560 --> 03:18.940
and my famous macaroni and cheese

03:18.940 --> 03:22.150
and trust me, it will be worth the wait.

03:22.150 --> 03:25.690
- I'm sure it will be,
but let me ask you...

03:25.690 --> 03:28.442
is that cornmeal on yo fingers?

03:28.442 --> 03:29.685
(both laughing)

03:29.685 --> 03:31.392
No, just let me get the
cornmeal off your fingers.

03:31.392 --> 03:34.016
- Cut it out, you play too
much, stop, oohhh ooohh.

03:34.016 --> 03:35.164
- Let me lick the cornmeal off ya fingers.

03:35.164 --> 03:39.509
- [Flo] You play too much (indistinct)!

03:39.509 --> 03:42.176
(phone ringing)

03:43.240 --> 03:44.920
Hello.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.692
Oh, hi baby! How you doing?

03:47.610 --> 03:49.309
Oh, you're almost here?

03:49.309 --> 03:52.786
Good! Okay, so what time
does your plane land?

03:52.786 --> 03:53.619
- Who dat!?

03:53.619 --> 03:55.050
- Shhhhh!

03:55.050 --> 03:56.880
Of course the invitation still stands,

03:56.880 --> 03:59.600
honey we'd be happy to have
you over for dinner Lisa.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.830
- Invitation? There's no invitation.

04:01.830 --> 04:02.663
- Yes.

04:02.663 --> 04:04.040
Six o'clock...

04:04.040 --> 04:07.293
I'll see you then. All
right. Merry Christmas, baby.

04:08.993 --> 04:09.826
- Um. Um hmm...

04:11.610 --> 04:12.620
- What?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.190
- Flo, you know better.

04:14.190 --> 04:16.449
Stop playin' matchmaker.

04:16.449 --> 04:17.440
- I'm not!

04:17.440 --> 04:18.430
- Um hm.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.630
- Well, maybe just a little.

04:20.630 --> 04:23.463
(R&B music plays)

04:45.079 --> 04:46.246
- Mom Johnson.

04:54.551 --> 04:55.718
Jonas Johnson.

04:58.290 --> 05:01.940
- That boy can make his
own decisions about love.

05:01.940 --> 05:05.080
You know, I did and look what it got me.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.777
Fine fox like you and I didn't
need no help (chuckles).

05:10.130 --> 05:12.832
Yeah, smooth as silk, I was, 'member?

05:12.832 --> 05:13.665
- Um hm.

05:13.665 --> 05:15.083
- Pretty Ricky's what they call me.

05:15.083 --> 05:18.495
(both laughing)

05:18.495 --> 05:19.900
- Thank you, sweetie,

05:19.900 --> 05:21.307
but Jonas is my baby

05:21.307 --> 05:24.580
and I know what's best for
him even when he doesn't.

05:24.580 --> 05:29.523
Besides it's my birthday and
I can do what I wanna do!

05:29.523 --> 05:30.550
(both chuckling)

05:30.550 --> 05:31.763
- You sure can, baby.

05:31.763 --> 05:34.430
(both laughing)

05:37.400 --> 05:38.233
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:42.950 --> 05:43.923
- Hello.

05:43.923 --> 05:45.700
- [Hair Client] (indistinct)
I can't believe you

05:45.700 --> 05:47.773
finally goin' bring yo
(indistinct), hold on.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.880
So, you just goin' open the garage,

05:52.880 --> 05:54.998
so Pookie and 'nem can
see me gettin' a weave?

05:54.998 --> 05:56.577
- Girl, it's hot in here.
- I can't with the garage!

05:56.577 --> 05:57.662
- It's hot in here!

05:57.662 --> 05:59.300
If you don't like it, you
can go to another salon.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.330
- Now, you know I ain't goin
find nobody else to do my hair

06:01.330 --> 06:02.950
for $15 a track.

06:02.950 --> 06:04.650
- Right, you get what you pay for.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.530
- Hey girl, I'm back,
more hood chronicles.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.010
So, I was shocked to see that you're going

06:11.010 --> 06:12.260
to the little party!

06:12.260 --> 06:14.875
- I was shocked when I received an invite.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.820
- (chuckles) Why? You know the Johnson's

06:16.820 --> 06:18.620
have always treated you like family.

06:19.549 --> 06:20.700
- I mean, we're pretty close

06:20.700 --> 06:22.893
and Mrs. Johnson only turns 50 once.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.160
- Yeah, you know Jonas is goin' be there.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.610
- Have you forgotten?
It's football season,

06:28.610 --> 06:30.330
so he won't be there.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.120
- Apparently, you don't watch the news.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.670
Jonas was injured and he
hasn't played in months.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.920
Rumor is he will never play again,

06:36.920 --> 06:40.230
girl you know them football
players get cut left and right.

06:40.230 --> 06:43.773
- Wow, I have to admit I'm
not much of a sports fan,

06:44.669 --> 06:46.600
but I'm sure he'll be
here with his teammates

06:46.600 --> 06:48.220
and besides his mom knows better

06:48.220 --> 06:50.930
than to put us in the same room together.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.500
- Why the hell would she
have a birthday party

06:52.500 --> 06:54.173
and not invite her son?

06:54.173 --> 06:56.989
- I don't know! Less drama maybe.

06:56.989 --> 06:58.080
- (laughing) Yeah.
- You know it's been a long

06:58.080 --> 07:00.333
time since the family's come together.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.940
- That girl's not family, Flo.

07:03.940 --> 07:06.350
She's an X-Factor, that's what she is.

07:06.350 --> 07:09.570
- She's a long time family
friend and that's close enough.

07:09.570 --> 07:13.080
- You heard me, let the
chocolate love connection

07:13.080 --> 07:14.103
take care of that.

07:15.350 --> 07:18.933
- Look, I just think they let
some things get in the way.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.170
They still didn't help
gettin' back together.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.930
- I hear he's quite the celebrity athlete,

07:25.930 --> 07:29.450
my mom said he, shuts the
whole city down when he visits.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.360
- [Hair Client] Yeah
and every time I see him

07:31.360 --> 07:33.110
he has a different girl on his arm.

07:34.411 --> 07:37.273
- Um, he has changed.

07:37.273 --> 07:39.610
- That he has, but he's just going through

07:39.610 --> 07:40.443
all those counterfeits,

07:40.443 --> 07:42.540
so that he can find his way back to you.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.010
- It'll be just fine.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.141
You know how I know?

07:45.141 --> 07:46.040
- How do you know?

07:46.040 --> 07:48.096
- Because whatever God's will is

07:48.096 --> 07:49.077
- Um.
- be!

07:49.077 --> 07:50.460
- Um!
- And if it's not meant

07:50.460 --> 07:52.690
to be, no worries.

07:52.690 --> 07:56.179
- Hmm, now, did you say God's will?

07:56.179 --> 07:57.020
- Um hm.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.600
- Well, if that be the case,

07:58.600 --> 08:00.750
why are you dippin' Flo?

08:00.750 --> 08:02.750
God don't need yo help!

08:02.750 --> 08:03.923
You wrong, Flo.

08:03.923 --> 08:07.000
- Oh baby, I just like seein' people happy

08:07.000 --> 08:08.851
like you and I, that's all.

08:08.851 --> 08:11.006
(both show each other affection)

08:11.006 --> 08:15.210
- Um hmm, well, if they have a chance

08:15.210 --> 08:17.577
for a fraction of what you and I have,

08:17.577 --> 08:19.977
then I guess it's nothing wrong with that.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.790
(both laughing)

08:22.790 --> 08:25.853
You think maybe later we can do that thing

08:25.853 --> 08:27.500
that we said we'd do once a year?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.123
You know, 'round...

08:29.123 --> 08:30.223
- On your birthday!

08:31.610 --> 08:34.023
Today is my birthday, Johnny.

08:35.090 --> 08:35.923
- Oh yeah.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.799
(R&B music plays)

08:45.572 --> 08:47.300
- It's me again, James
Brown, work for the people

08:47.300 --> 08:50.500
and I feel good!

08:50.500 --> 08:51.333
- Come on in.

08:52.270 --> 08:55.430
- Thank you Mr. Johnson,
how are you today, sir?

08:55.430 --> 08:57.940
- I was doing good, I was.

08:57.940 --> 08:58.773
Come on in.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.590
- I doubt that, I mean,

09:02.590 --> 09:04.890
he finally has what he's always wanted

09:04.890 --> 09:06.910
and that's fame and fortune.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.500
Something, I never really
too much cared for.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.630
Well, except for the
fortune part (laughs)!

09:12.630 --> 09:13.550
- Girl, you better do like everybody else

09:13.550 --> 09:16.200
and open you up a little boutique.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.907
Have him pay for it, he good for it.

09:17.907 --> 09:20.180
You better get him before he
spend the rest of that money

09:20.180 --> 09:21.140
on them white girls.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.433
Stop! Being rough, girl
let me call you back,

09:23.433 --> 09:25.440
I'll see you in a minute.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.987
Why you gotta be so rough!?

09:28.999 --> 09:32.827
- (chuckles) Crazy, old Danny (chuckles).

09:36.040 --> 09:37.640
- And y'all ain't got nothin' else to do?

09:37.640 --> 09:39.600
You ain't got nobody to kill?

09:39.600 --> 09:40.720
Nobody to rough up?

09:40.720 --> 09:42.300
You just goin' stare at me?

09:42.300 --> 09:43.700
Oh, y'all just still goin' look?

09:43.700 --> 09:46.250
Y'all aint never seen nobody get weave?

09:46.250 --> 09:47.880
I know I've been sayin'
this my hair for years,

09:47.880 --> 09:49.243
but it is, but it ain't.

09:50.840 --> 09:51.880
- It's a lot to look at,

09:51.880 --> 09:53.681
like all head.
- What you talkin' about?

09:53.681 --> 09:56.050
- And tell your little girlfriend
that this is my real hair,

09:56.050 --> 09:58.010
'cause I know she be asking.

09:58.010 --> 09:59.163
Stop, bein' so rough!

10:01.120 --> 10:02.560
That's why you get fired from every salon.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.880
I'm the last customer you got!

10:04.880 --> 10:06.220
- You can get out my garage
if you don't like it.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.120
- And then how you goin pay your rent?

10:10.060 --> 10:11.300
- I like the hood.

10:12.357 --> 10:15.963
You know those white people
don't need me in the suburbs.

10:17.150 --> 10:21.833
- Sir, I understand it can be
hard to let go and move on,

10:22.890 --> 10:25.063
but it'll be better, don't you think?

10:26.870 --> 10:29.170
- Listen, James,
- James (indistinct).

10:29.170 --> 10:31.889
- that's the problem with some people,

10:31.889 --> 10:33.690
they get a little money and they forget

10:33.690 --> 10:35.690
about the community that they came from.

10:38.540 --> 10:39.373
I'm not selling!

10:46.577 --> 10:49.494
(R&B music begins)

11:15.260 --> 11:16.221
- Whoo!

11:16.221 --> 11:17.212
- Oh man!

11:17.212 --> 11:19.053
Um! Tastes like victory.

11:21.660 --> 11:23.610
So, you thought more about what I said?

11:24.466 --> 11:25.966
About being down with the set?

11:26.840 --> 11:29.630
- I don't know man, it
just seems kind of...

11:29.630 --> 11:31.290
- Yo! Forget about tryin' to get that

11:31.290 --> 11:33.510
basketball scholarship!

11:33.510 --> 11:34.343
What! Why are you wasting your time

11:34.343 --> 11:35.883
on an empty dream anyways?

11:37.348 --> 11:39.000
You never goin' be like your brother.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.290
So stop livin' in the shadows.

11:40.290 --> 11:42.180
- Why are you bringing up Jonas?

11:42.180 --> 11:44.090
For real, you know I hate that man.

11:44.090 --> 11:47.890
I get it, I'm not like him, I
don't need you reminding me.

11:47.890 --> 11:48.763
Just drop it man.

11:49.722 --> 11:51.139
- All right, man.

11:56.625 --> 11:57.625
- Ugh man...

12:00.532 --> 12:01.460
It's Jonas, man.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.433
Hold on.
- Aight man.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.540
- Yo, what's up?

12:09.540 --> 12:13.160
- Big dog! Hey little bro.
Just called to check on you,

12:13.160 --> 12:13.993

12:13.993 --> 12:16.190
- I'm busy man, what do you want?

12:16.190 --> 12:17.440
- Oh you busy (chuckles)?

12:19.880 --> 12:22.220
Just lettin' you know comin' in town.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.570
- I mean, cause we never see you,

12:23.570 --> 12:26.401
but your name is the most
talked about in the house.

12:26.401 --> 12:28.090
- Aye, well I miss y'all too man.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.900
Now in fact look, keep it under wraps

12:29.900 --> 12:31.260
I'm comin' in town soon.

12:31.260 --> 12:34.123
Wanna spend some quality
time wit' you and the family.

12:34.123 --> 12:35.320
Aight?

12:35.320 --> 12:37.523
- Yeah, aight superstar, bye!

12:40.730 --> 12:41.563
- Hello?

12:50.843 --> 12:52.260
- Thank you, man.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.357
That's my little brother.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.795
- I'm down.

13:00.795 --> 13:02.245
- That's what I like to hear.

13:07.023 --> 13:11.184
- ♪ Go tell it on the mountain, ♪

13:11.184 --> 13:15.577
♪ over the hills and everywhere! ♪

13:15.577 --> 13:19.044
♪ Go tell it on the mountain, ♪

13:19.044 --> 13:21.520
♪ that Jesus Christ... ♪

13:21.520 --> 13:23.270
oh baby, that goes right over here.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.344
(humming)

13:33.090 --> 13:36.423
(dramatic music begins)

13:42.990 --> 13:45.910
- Felt the house kinda
rockin' when you came in.

13:45.910 --> 13:46.760
- Hmm!

14:48.510 --> 14:50.430

- Flo! You told her about that!?

14:52.920 --> 14:56.530
- She told me. We are girls!
We don't keep secrets.

14:56.530 --> 14:58.470
She told me something else too.

14:58.470 --> 15:00.409
She said without them little blue pills,

15:00.409 --> 15:02.724

This house is bought

18:09.410 --> 18:13.955
over the recent loss of

18:15.950 --> 18:17.390

24:59.770 --> 25:01.940
- Um um, (indistinct).

25:01.940 --> 25:03.660
Do you owe Boogie some money?

25:03.660 --> 25:06.050
I better not find out
you owe him anything!

25:06.050 --> 25:08.000
You know what? Today is your lucky day!

25:09.940 --> 25:12.437
Stop cryin', I'ma let you go, okay?

25:12.437 --> 25:14.570
And you better not tell Boogie I did this,

25:14.570 --> 25:16.760
because if you did, I'ma tell him...

25:18.140 --> 25:20.570

25:20.570 --> 25:22.320
So, go 'head, Merry Christmas fool.

Hold up! Get yo ass back over here!

25:26.060 --> 25:27.410
Put the luggage in the car!

25:30.572 --> 25:32.723

- Gently! Gently!

25:34.650 --> 25:38.070
Hey girl! I know that

25:38.070 --> 25:39.350

25:39.350 --> 25:42.267
(R&B music begins)

25:51.212 --> 25:52.045
- Here son.

25:52.045 --> 25:52.878
- Thank you, ma.

25:52.878 --> 25:53.940
- Jasmine, can I get you anything else?

25:53.940 --> 25:55.920
- No thanks though, where's your restroom?

25:55.920 --> 25:57.093
- Right down the hall.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.713
Don't use the good towels.

26:00.713 --> 26:01.613
- Barbara, please.

26:04.130 --> 26:07.262
- Why can't she use the good towels?

26:07.262 --> 26:08.095
I use the good towels.

26:08.095 --> 26:11.170
- Hmm, from the looks of
the strains on your shirt,

26:11.170 --> 26:13.113
I could've swore you was using your shirt!

26:15.187 --> 26:18.410
- (chuckles) Last week,
I wiped with that skunk

26:18.410 --> 26:21.127
you got on your head, you
call it a weave (laughing).

26:22.600 --> 26:25.517
(R&B music begins)

26:31.410 --> 26:32.763
- You look real familiar.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.130
- Yeah, I played basketball at Middleton,

26:36.130 --> 26:37.864
maybe you seen a game or two.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.400
- (chuckles) Nah, nah...

26:41.750 --> 26:43.500

26:48.270 --> 26:49.170
- Yeah, that's my brother.

26:49.170 --> 26:51.507
What that got to do wit' anything?

26:51.507 --> 26:53.053
- (chuckles) This dude here.

26:54.050 --> 26:56.370
What's that got to do wit anything?

26:56.370 --> 26:58.950
Man, your brother's the
top player in the NFL,

26:58.950 --> 27:00.700
making mad paper!

27:00.700 --> 27:01.673
Why in the hell would you be in here

27:01.673 --> 27:03.840
wit' a room full of killers?

27:03.840 --> 27:05.220
Must be crazy.
- (chuckles).

27:07.090 --> 27:10.520
- Well, that's just it. That's his paper.

27:10.520 --> 27:14.430
Ready to make my own and make
a little name for myself.

27:14.430 --> 27:19.430
- Okay, hmm, I can dig it.
This little dude got heart.

27:19.470 --> 27:20.343
- Told you, man.

27:21.860 --> 27:22.693
- We'll see.

27:30.290 --> 27:34.130
I tell you what? Meet me
in the park tonight at 10

27:34.130 --> 27:36.280
and we'll see just how much heart you got?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.380
Now get up outta here!

27:44.130 --> 27:45.810
These clowns here, man!

27:45.810 --> 27:47.260
- Boss?

27:47.260 --> 27:48.417
- Pour me a drink, man.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.723
- You got it, boss.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.540
- Is this the reason why you
don't come around anymore?

27:52.540 --> 27:54.150
- Nah, ma, you know I'm used to it.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.270
I do worry about Jasmine,

27:55.270 --> 27:58.233
she hasn't been around
this type family before.

27:58.233 --> 28:00.500
(indistinct) you think about
her man, she's fine, right?

28:00.500 --> 28:05.500
- Who her? Well, I mean, if you
like skin and bones, I mean,

28:06.870 --> 28:08.860
she just looks like the type of girl

28:08.860 --> 28:13.273
if you rubbed up against
her, she'd start a fire.

28:13.273 --> 28:14.573
(chuckling) a little twig!

28:16.121 --> 28:18.030
- She remind me of one of them
monster high (indistinct).

28:18.030 --> 28:19.481
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:19.481 --> 28:21.447
- I felt sorry for her. I
wanted to hug her again.

28:21.447 --> 28:25.757
"Listen here baby, you can
eat, here's a chicken wing."

28:25.757 --> 28:27.395
Here is a chicken wing.

28:27.395 --> 28:29.150
(laughing)

28:29.150 --> 28:32.530
- I agree with all of that,
just don't you hug her.

28:32.530 --> 28:34.463
You'll suffocate the poor thing.

28:36.676 --> 28:37.998
- Get out of here.

28:37.998 --> 28:42.320
- Son, I'm the type of brother,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.013
like a little meat on this bones.

28:45.150 --> 28:46.910
You see, I'm from the dirty south.

28:46.910 --> 28:49.110
- Wit' a funky mouth.

28:49.110 --> 28:50.478
- Shave your armpits!

28:50.478 --> 28:52.790
(laughing)

28:52.790 --> 28:53.817
Listen son!

28:53.817 --> 28:56.185
- I'm listenin pops.

28:56.185 --> 28:58.080
- A brother like me, likes a woman

28:58.080 --> 29:01.440
that I can cuddle up to
her in the winter time

29:01.440 --> 29:03.203
and keep warm.

29:06.130 --> 29:07.063
Big booty!

29:08.530 --> 29:09.669
- Come on.

29:09.669 --> 29:10.897
- You understand what I'm sayin'?

29:12.340 --> 29:13.980
Like your mother.

29:13.980 --> 29:18.040
- Pause pops, that's too
much information, okay?

29:18.040 --> 29:20.610
- Yes, well, it's how you got here.

29:20.610 --> 29:21.893
- Okay, pops.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.210
- Son, there's so much more to a woman

29:26.210 --> 29:27.500
than just how she looks.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.330
- Now, I know pops, so
besides that, you know,

29:29.330 --> 29:31.580
she is a good woman,
comes from a good family,

29:31.580 --> 29:36.510
she supports me and more
importantly pops, it's no drama.

29:36.510 --> 29:38.400
- No drama?
- No drama, no backtalk,

29:38.400 --> 29:39.673
no lip.

29:39.673 --> 29:44.673
- No lip!? Wait, wait.

29:45.697 --> 29:47.210
No lip?

29:47.210 --> 29:50.137
Son, I don't even know
what that feels like.

29:50.137 --> 29:51.010
I don't know what it feels like,

29:51.010 --> 29:52.793
I don't know what it sounds like.

29:52.793 --> 29:54.254
- Quiet.

29:54.254 --> 29:56.070
- Quiet. Man, yo mama

29:56.070 --> 29:57.920
sleeps wit' her fists balled up at night

29:57.920 --> 29:59.353
in case I start something.

29:59.353 --> 30:01.580
- And that's what I'm
talkin about pops, exactly.

30:01.580 --> 30:04.980
Jasmine and I, we don't
fight, we don't argue.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.460
There's no drama, she...
- What you say?

30:07.460 --> 30:08.293
- She's perfect.

30:10.286 --> 30:13.193
- (chuckles) There no perfect women's son.

30:14.989 --> 30:16.863
- Maybe, but she's close.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.089
- Well, yeah, that's what
you said about the last one

30:21.089 --> 30:22.956
wasn't it? Yeah, and the one before that.

30:22.956 --> 30:23.789
- Yes!

30:23.789 --> 30:24.720
- The woman before that,
- [Barbara] Right!

30:24.720 --> 30:26.700
- Wasn't it? What happened
to that white girl

30:26.700 --> 30:28.040
you brought here a couple of summers ago?

30:28.040 --> 30:30.940
- Can you stop with the
white girl talk, it's Amy,

30:30.940 --> 30:32.360
her name is Amy.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.850
- Amy!? Boy, I don't
care what her name is!

30:34.850 --> 30:37.622
She can't use our comb,
why'd you bring her home?

30:37.622 --> 30:38.967
(everyone laughs)

30:38.967 --> 30:41.078
- But do y'all remember that Asian girl?

30:41.078 --> 30:43.392
- Yeah, yeah, yeah (laughing)!

30:43.392 --> 30:44.715
- That poor thing honey, she thought the

30:44.715 --> 30:47.853
chitlins was pasta.
- Yes she did! Yes she did.

30:47.853 --> 30:49.900
- That was crazy, you
know she broke up wit' me?

30:49.900 --> 30:51.456
Thought we was tryin' to kill her,

30:51.456 --> 30:52.550
thought we was tryin' to poison her.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.618
Tryin' to feed her feces or whatever.

30:55.618 --> 30:57.840
- Well, at least I can say this
is the closest one to black

30:57.840 --> 30:59.208
that you brought since this (indistinct).

30:59.208 --> 31:00.521
- Now, I agree with that.

31:00.521 --> 31:01.610
(everyone talking at once)

31:01.610 --> 31:03.730
- Okay, that's enough
everybody, all right?

31:03.730 --> 31:04.880
- It's okay ma, 'cause you know what,

31:04.880 --> 31:06.687
I had to go through my share of women

31:06.687 --> 31:07.520
to get to the right one

31:07.520 --> 31:09.770
and I feel that Jasmine's the right one.

31:09.770 --> 31:11.270
- Boy, if you don't get your head

31:11.270 --> 31:13.076
out of the crack of your ass!

31:13.076 --> 31:14.080
- Barbara!

31:14.080 --> 31:14.913
- What!?

31:14.913 --> 31:18.530
- Now son, I'm sure
Jasmine is a nice girl,

31:18.530 --> 31:21.633
but to bring her here to meet
your family after you engage,

31:22.490 --> 31:24.280
don't sound like she's the one.

31:24.280 --> 31:28.607
- Honey, everything that
looks good ain't good for you.

31:28.607 --> 31:29.440
- Ain't that the truth.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.223
- Um! Oh yes sir, I'm telling you.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.473
- She's all right. We good.

31:35.551 --> 31:38.030
(doorbell rings)

31:38.030 --> 31:40.267
- Baby, it's so good to see you.

31:40.267 --> 31:42.770
Look at you! Honey, you
look just as beautiful

31:42.770 --> 31:45.332
as you did five or so years ago!

31:45.332 --> 31:46.165
- Thank you, it has been

31:46.165 --> 31:47.340
a long time hasn't it?
- It has been.

31:47.340 --> 31:51.647
- Awww, that's my girl! How
you doin' baby? Bring it in!

31:51.647 --> 31:53.470
- (laughs)
- Awww,

31:53.470 --> 31:56.660

31:56.660 --> 31:59.665
It feels good to be home,
New York is phenomenal!

31:59.665 --> 32:00.988
Oh my gosh, you would (indistinct).

32:00.988 --> 32:01.821
- Oooohhh, oh yes!
- You know what?

32:01.821 --> 32:02.654
we should do girls weekend.

32:02.654 --> 32:03.832
Go shoppin'!
- Girls trip.

32:03.832 --> 32:05.030
- Girls trip.
- Oh I love it!

32:05.030 --> 32:08.820
- That would be awesome!
That would be awesome.

32:10.538 --> 32:14.522
Hmmm, I'm ready. Um um,
don't worry about that.

32:14.522 --> 32:17.967
- (chuckles) Stop it, you're
gonna get us in trouble.

32:17.967 --> 32:18.800
- Lisa?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.437
What are you doin' here?

32:26.437 --> 32:27.987
I didn't expect you to be here.

32:30.410 --> 32:32.430
- Neither did I.

32:32.430 --> 32:37.340
I mean, I wasn't expecting
for you to be here either.

32:37.340 --> 32:39.460
Your mom said that you're hardly home

32:39.460 --> 32:41.540
during football season, so...

32:42.730 --> 32:45.600
- Yeah, I'm on injured reserve,
so coach let me fly out,

32:45.600 --> 32:49.880
but mom, you didn't tell me
that Lisa was gonna be here.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.821
- I ain't gotta tell you nothing'!

32:51.821 --> 32:52.654
- Nothin'.

32:52.654 --> 32:55.020
- This is my birthday and it's my house!

32:55.020 --> 32:57.080
- Absolutely.
- Yes, it is baby.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.830
- That's right and you didn't even tell us

32:58.830 --> 33:00.200
that she was comin'.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.033
- What?

33:01.033 --> 33:03.270
- Honey, Lisa is my guest.

33:03.270 --> 33:04.120
Baby, can I take it?

33:04.120 --> 33:05.327
- Yes.

33:05.327 --> 33:06.160
- Look at her.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.365
- Ooohhhh.
- Ooohhhhh.

33:07.365 --> 33:08.198
- Dang!

33:08.198 --> 33:10.010
(everyone laughs)

33:10.010 --> 33:12.463
Son, you are in trouble.

33:12.463 --> 33:13.296
- Mom, come on man.

33:13.296 --> 33:16.868

33:16.868 --> 33:18.410

33:18.410 --> 33:22.106
- Well, this is Jasmine.

33:22.106 --> 33:22.939
- Awwww.

33:23.930 --> 33:26.313
- My fiance, my fiance.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.570
- Boy why did you have to say that?

33:28.570 --> 33:29.653
- 'Cause she is!

33:29.653 --> 33:31.493
- Naw, you dumb just like yo daddy.

33:32.350 --> 33:34.210
- No, it's okay.
- Yes, he is.

33:34.210 --> 33:37.590
- Hi, I'm Lisa, I'm an
old friend of Jonas'.

33:37.590 --> 33:40.200
Have we met? You look familiar.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.490
- Oh no, I'm sure we don't
run in the same circles.

33:42.490 --> 33:45.970
- Absolutely not, 'cause she
runs in a pack a gold diggers.

33:45.970 --> 33:46.873
- What did she just say?
- Nothin'.

33:46.873 --> 33:48.918
- Yes, she does.

33:48.918 --> 33:50.620
- Barbara, will you come

33:50.620 --> 33:53.130
Can you please come help

33:53.130 --> 33:55.570
- And while you're in there,

33:57.700 --> 33:59.595

33:59.595 --> 34:02.000
- So, I hear you're quite
the man on the field.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.543
Some things never change.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.833
- You know, I do all right,
you know, a little bit.

34:09.016 --> 34:11.520
- All right? Baby don't be so modest.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.163
My man, has it goin' on.

34:14.340 --> 34:17.237
These last few years have been wonderful.

34:23.710 --> 34:25.500
- We've been off and on for a few years,

34:25.500 --> 34:28.960
but Jonas just popped the
question just last week!

34:28.960 --> 34:29.922
Look at my rock.

34:30.790 --> 34:32.683
- Yes, it's beautiful!

34:33.600 --> 34:36.438
Jonas, what took you so long?

34:36.438 --> 34:37.973
- I, you know, had to make sure

34:37.973 --> 34:39.871
she was the right woman for me,

34:39.871 --> 34:43.521
so it's only goin' be
one Mrs. Johnson, so...

34:43.521 --> 34:44.353
- That ain't even goin' happen.

34:44.353 --> 34:47.050
- Um um.
- They didn't even set a date.

34:47.050 --> 34:49.790
They didn't even set a date.
- Um um, um um.

34:49.790 --> 34:50.840
- It ain't happenin'.

34:51.830 --> 34:55.130
- Hey, what's up lil
bro? How's everything...?

34:55.130 --> 34:56.969
- Lisa!
- Heyyyy!

34:56.969 --> 34:58.278
How are you (indistinct)?

34:58.278 --> 34:59.111
- Hello, how are you?

34:59.111 --> 35:02.800
- You have grown to be such
a tall, handsome young man!

35:02.800 --> 35:03.710
- Yes, yes, yes,

35:03.710 --> 35:06.110
I was hopin' that I'd see
you around here again.

35:06.945 --> 35:08.850
You know, you're my favorite!
- Okay. So tell me what's been

35:08.850 --> 35:09.740

35:09.740 --> 35:11.980
How's school? Do you have a girlfriend?

35:11.980 --> 35:13.530
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, y'all

35:13.530 --> 35:14.363
later on...

35:14.363 --> 35:16.790
Derek, I want you to meet my fiance.

35:16.790 --> 35:20.170
- All right man, but I'm
talkin' to Lisa. All right?

35:20.170 --> 35:21.003
I'll get to it.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.926
Don't expect me to jump
every time you say jump.

35:24.926 --> 35:27.676
- Hey man, you who you think
you talkin' to little man?

35:29.915 --> 35:31.838
You know what? It's okay.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.477
- You know what? I'm
gonna run to the restroom.

35:34.850 --> 35:35.890
You all catch up.

35:35.890 --> 35:37.020
- Okay.
- All right.

35:37.020 --> 35:39.110
- Son, why are you and your
brother always goin at it?

35:39.110 --> 35:40.353
Look, he just got home.

35:40.353 --> 35:41.960
- It's okay mom.
- He's not gonna be here.

35:41.960 --> 35:44.060
- Oh baby, listen honey, he just got home!

35:47.181 --> 35:50.772
(bathroom door closes)

35:50.772 --> 35:55.605
Come on, Lisa. You got this.

35:55.605 --> 35:57.205
You can do this, pull yourself together.

35:57.205 --> 36:00.122
(R&B music begins)

36:11.497 --> 36:13.914
(runs water)

36:23.134 --> 36:23.967
- Just get somethin' to eat,

36:23.967 --> 36:24.800
come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.730
- Okay mom, sorry about that.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.587
It's mom's birthday, let's just...

36:30.587 --> 36:33.337
Doin' it for her, while I'm here.

36:40.368 --> 36:41.699
(doorbell rings)

36:41.699 --> 36:42.700
- Who could that be?

36:42.700 --> 36:45.250
- Oh, oh, I almost forgot

36:45.250 --> 36:47.000
about my surprise guest (chuckles)!

36:48.380 --> 36:49.870
Baby, do me a favor...

36:49.870 --> 36:51.000
go open that door.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.780
- Guest!? Honey, you didn't

36:54.780 --> 36:56.970
- Yeah, but you goin' like this one!

36:56.970 --> 37:00.330
Especially you big draws

37:00.330 --> 37:02.820
you can officially no longer say,

37:02.820 --> 37:05.774
I've never done anything nice for you.

37:05.774 --> 37:08.055
- Shut up.
- (chuckles).

37:08.055 --> 37:08.888
Whoooo!

37:11.449 --> 37:14.446
(laughing) Charlie!!
- Hey there, Johnny!

37:14.446 --> 37:15.279
How you doin'?

37:15.279 --> 37:17.760
- Boy, looka there,

37:17.760 --> 37:18.977
- Yeah, you know (indistinct).

37:20.142 --> 37:21.210
(both laughing)

37:21.210 --> 37:25.060
- Listen here, I got
somebody I need you to meet.

37:25.060 --> 37:25.893
- Oh yeah?

37:25.893 --> 37:28.530
Where she at? Is she thick?

37:28.530 --> 37:30.143
Red bone or chocolate milk?

37:32.005 --> 37:33.699
Is that her right there?

37:33.699 --> 37:35.763
Now, you know I can't do 'em that young.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.377
- Let's get a closer look (chuckles).

37:42.820 --> 37:46.120
Charlie, this here, my
heffer in law, I mean,

37:46.120 --> 37:49.177
Lord have mercy, this is my sister in law.

37:49.177 --> 37:51.333
- (chuckles) Hello, my name is Barbie.

37:52.750 --> 37:55.910
- Barbie? Listen, barbaric she might be,

37:55.910 --> 37:57.840
but Barbie, she is not (chuckles).

37:58.829 --> 38:00.280
She called herself Barbie.
- It's so good to meet you.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.263
- Baby, the pleasure is all mine!

38:03.390 --> 38:05.787
Lord Jesus, you finer

38:07.275 --> 38:09.686
(everyone laughs)

38:09.686 --> 38:12.406
Johnny, you didn't tell
me she was this fine!

38:12.406 --> 38:13.825
- (chuckling) Ooohh, I
do believe I like you.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.148
(chuckling)
- Um, um, um.

38:15.148 --> 38:16.390
- Mess around and make me fall in love.

38:16.390 --> 38:19.740
- Wait, wait, fine, love?

38:19.740 --> 38:22.243
I just throwed up in
my mouth a little bit.

38:28.694 --> 38:30.967
- Yes Lord, yes Lord.

38:31.957 --> 38:35.504
(chuckling) Heyyy (chuckling)!

38:35.504 --> 38:38.830
- Yeah, see, see, see, um

38:40.760 --> 38:42.833
Now, who's the matchmaker
now huh (laughs)!?

38:43.667 --> 38:44.500
- You need to be ashamed of yoself.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.670
- Baby, I give it six months,
she goin' be out of my house.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.283
Muah!
- Stop it.

38:50.410 --> 38:52.110
- All right, everybody, let's eat.

38:53.555 --> 38:57.373
(upbeat music plays)

38:57.373 --> 39:00.206
(family chatting)

39:03.860 --> 39:07.186
- Dad, can you please do the
honors of saying the blessings

39:07.186 --> 39:09.110
over my birthday dinner?

39:09.110 --> 39:13.170
- Of course I will, you know,
I've got to get my prayer on

39:13.170 --> 39:15.420
at least two, three
times a year (chuckling).

39:16.260 --> 39:17.793
Ahh, yeah, okay.

39:20.170 --> 39:21.460
Dear God...

39:23.645 --> 39:24.562
Dear God...

39:27.611 --> 39:29.120

39:38.162 --> 39:39.397

39:40.510 --> 39:42.090

39:42.090 --> 39:43.910

39:43.910 --> 39:44.960
Happy Birthday, baby.

39:49.010 --> 39:51.870
- You know Jonas, you

39:51.870 --> 39:54.119
My daughter's still askin' about you.

39:54.119 --> 39:54.952
- Um.

39:54.952 --> 39:56.359
- Hell, he had all the
girls runnin' after him!

39:56.359 --> 39:57.470
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, heyyy!

39:57.470 --> 39:59.760
He's just like his daddy
on that one (laughing)!

40:00.664 --> 40:05.664
- ♪ The devil is a liar. He
ain't even yours. Baaa. ♪

40:06.076 --> 40:07.463
(family members chuckle)

40:07.463 --> 40:08.660
- Hand me that chicken right there.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.030
- Auntie...

40:10.030 --> 40:13.970
so Lisa, I heard through the grapevine

40:13.970 --> 40:15.387
that you are a partner
at a pretty big law firm

40:15.387 --> 40:17.330
out there in New York.

40:17.330 --> 40:19.921
- Well, actually I own my (indistinct),

40:19.921 --> 40:21.222
- (laughing).

40:21.222 --> 40:23.974
but yes, I've had it for a few years now.

40:23.974 --> 40:27.050
(family members speak at once)

40:27.050 --> 40:30.290
- Really? Well, Congratulations on that.

40:30.290 --> 40:31.680
- Thank you.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.920
- Starting a business
can be pretty rough, huh?

40:33.920 --> 40:36.670
I mean most businesses fail
within like the first year.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.451
- I've done fairly well.

40:39.451 --> 40:40.284
- (chuckles)

40:40.284 --> 40:42.030
Most of my clients are
white collar millionaires.

40:42.030 --> 40:43.457
- Yessss!
- Outstanding!

40:44.550 --> 40:47.290
(family members chatting at once)

40:47.290 --> 40:48.889
- Well, I am proud of you

40:48.889 --> 40:51.822
and I wondered what you were
doin after all these years.

40:51.822 --> 40:54.265
- (chuckles).

40:54.265 --> 40:56.765
- (chuckles).

40:58.683 --> 41:02.520
- Well Jay and I started
our own clothing line.

41:02.520 --> 41:05.560
We broke a little over even
this year, small profit,

41:05.560 --> 41:07.610
but we're on our way.

41:07.610 --> 41:09.081
- Right.

41:09.081 --> 41:11.054
- Heffer, ain't nobody talkin' to you.

41:11.054 --> 41:12.200
- Hmm.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.267
- They tryin' to catch up
and there you go dippin' in.

41:15.267 --> 41:17.903
(in funny voice) Small
profits, but we're on our way.

41:17.903 --> 41:20.683
Heffer, let them catch up! Dang!

41:21.820 --> 41:22.653
- Good Lord.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.390
- Look, y'all thought it, I just said it.

41:26.390 --> 41:27.223
(some family members agree in unison)

41:27.223 --> 41:29.690
- Listen, listen, Jasmine
handles my financials,

41:29.690 --> 41:30.540
so that's why she's (indistinct).

41:30.540 --> 41:31.373
- Figures...

41:32.830 --> 41:35.260
She's a gold digger.
- (chuckling).

41:35.260 --> 41:38.477
- Lisa, honey, I'm so proud of you.

41:40.410 --> 41:42.050
Jonas and Jasmine too.

41:42.050 --> 41:43.133
- Thank you, mom.

41:44.130 --> 41:44.990
- So Jay...

41:47.928 --> 41:49.473
- (hesitantly) Yes, Aunt B?

41:51.490 --> 41:53.510
- Why did you bring her here?

41:53.510 --> 41:56.843
Yeah, why? I mean, you don't love her.

41:59.020 --> 42:00.716
She's a pretty girl and all of that,

42:00.716 --> 42:04.374
but look here, you and
Lisa, y'all got history.

42:04.374 --> 42:05.750
- (laughs).

42:05.750 --> 42:09.802
- This is temporary, five
years are goin' pass,

42:09.802 --> 42:12.153
you're goin' be lookin' for
Lisa and it's goin' be too late!

42:13.790 --> 42:18.790
I'm just saying, hmm? What? What uh huh.

42:18.890 --> 42:21.853
Y'all know y'all thought
it, I just said it.

42:24.577 --> 42:25.410
You know what, as a matter of fact,

42:25.410 --> 42:26.830
let's get it all out there on the table,

42:26.830 --> 42:27.710
that's what we goin' do.

42:27.710 --> 42:30.530
Let's get it all out on the
table, right here, right now!

42:30.530 --> 42:33.320
- Not on your sister's birthday Hamhock!

42:33.320 --> 42:36.420
- Listen, somethin'
wrong? We not good enough?

42:36.420 --> 42:37.253
Me and your mama?

42:37.253 --> 42:38.880
- Hold, stop, Auntie, hold it.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.440
What are you talking about right now?

42:40.440 --> 42:43.370
- Listen, every time you
bring a woman in this house,

42:43.370 --> 42:46.860
she don't never look like me
and Flo, I'm tellin' ya now!

42:46.860 --> 42:50.720
if she ain't white, I'm tellin'
you, if she's a black girl,

42:50.720 --> 42:51.600
- Barbara don't!

42:51.600 --> 42:53.310
- Um, I'm just sayin'.

42:53.310 --> 42:56.290
- Color has never been
an issue in this house

42:56.290 --> 42:58.680
and definitely not colorism.

42:58.680 --> 43:01.593
Honey, I taught my boys
that love is colorblind.

43:03.390 --> 43:06.937
- Listen Flo, that's yo
son, you goin' support him,

43:06.937 --> 43:08.817
you goin' let him slide wit everything,

43:08.817 --> 43:11.190
but I'm gonna say it, because
see you love him, Flo,

43:11.190 --> 43:13.088
I love him too, but I'm
goin' tell him the truth.

43:13.088 --> 43:14.160
- Let her get it out!

43:14.160 --> 43:17.161
- Is this what fame does, huh?

43:17.161 --> 43:19.410
- She goin' say what she want anyway.

43:19.410 --> 43:24.290
- Is this what fame does?
Is this what fame does?

43:28.110 --> 43:30.683
Get you so far away from your roots?

43:32.160 --> 43:34.500
Get you somebody that
look like me or your mama

43:34.500 --> 43:39.143
and not some barbie, 'cause
you sure as hell ain't Ken.

43:46.780 --> 43:49.030
- At least get someone
look like your mother.

43:50.190 --> 43:51.570
At least your mama.

43:51.570 --> 43:54.963
- Whoa pops, come on,
what you talkin' bout man?

43:55.950 --> 43:57.160
Come on, it's not even like that.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.410
- No, so what is the like?

43:58.410 --> 44:00.260
I mean, no disrespect to you baby,

44:00.260 --> 44:02.560
but (chuckles) he can do better.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.733
- No disrespect,

44:04.840 --> 44:06.340
just cause you,
- Just because of what?

44:06.340 --> 44:07.930
- Just, 'cause you say
"No disrespect" at the end

44:07.930 --> 44:10.680
of your insults, doesn't make
it any less disrespectful.

44:10.680 --> 44:12.219
- See, this what I'm talkin' about.

44:12.219 --> 44:13.680
Get rid of her.
(some family members chuckle)

44:13.680 --> 44:15.573
Get rid of her nephew!

44:16.750 --> 44:18.001
- Dad do something.

44:18.001 --> 44:19.960
- What you want me to do?

44:19.960 --> 44:21.513
I tried to tell you!

44:23.320 --> 44:28.320
Besides this, this better
than "Iyanla fix your life."

44:30.318 --> 44:32.651
(laughing).

44:33.593 --> 44:35.289
- You know what!?

44:35.289 --> 44:36.513
- What!?
- Let it go, just let it go,

44:36.513 --> 44:38.100
just let it go, leave it alone.

44:38.100 --> 44:40.770
- No! I wanna address
what your aunt just said.

44:40.770 --> 44:41.760
- Hey stop,

44:41.760 --> 44:43.330
stop, stop, stop, let it go.

44:43.330 --> 44:44.163
- No!

44:46.041 --> 44:50.453
- Goin' and let her! Yeah, address me.

44:52.345 --> 44:53.530
- That's what's wrong wit' you people.

44:53.530 --> 44:55.780
- Wait. You people. Did
she say "You people?"

44:56.670 --> 44:59.380
- See, see, see, look, I
said leave it alone, right?

44:59.380 --> 45:00.533
Just sit down Jas.

45:01.660 --> 45:03.661
Jasmine! Sit down now.

45:03.661 --> 45:05.752
- [Barbara] (chuckling)
- Now!

45:05.752 --> 45:07.252
- Whoo hoooo, yes!

45:09.197 --> 45:10.030
And you're just goin' let him shut you up,

45:10.030 --> 45:11.620
and sit you down like that, huh?

45:12.822 --> 45:15.472
Let me let you understand
somethin' real good, honey.

45:17.180 --> 45:19.863
Jay was raised to respect women

45:19.863 --> 45:20.696
- Um hmm.

45:20.696 --> 45:23.830
- Women! All right, but listen here

45:24.920 --> 45:27.790
and had he talked to one of us like that?

45:27.790 --> 45:28.653
Lord have mercy on his soul.

45:28.653 --> 45:30.669
- Ain't that the truth?

45:30.669 --> 45:33.170
- Exactly, exactly what I'm talking about.

45:33.170 --> 45:34.180
You know what I'm saying?

45:34.180 --> 45:39.180
This is why, that I will
never be with a woman like,

45:39.661 --> 45:40.494
you know what?

45:40.494 --> 45:41.327
- Say it.

45:41.327 --> 45:42.877
- No, no, no, no, it's okay, no, no, no.

45:42.877 --> 45:43.940
- No, say it.

45:43.940 --> 45:46.447
- It's pointless, just...
- No, I want you to finally

45:46.447 --> 45:48.273
say it so we can know who you really are!

45:48.273 --> 45:50.467
- THIS WHY I DON'T COME HOME, AUNTIE!

45:59.750 --> 46:01.973
'Cause you're embarrassing,
look what you doing!

46:03.444 --> 46:04.990
(slams table)
- Now, I said it!

46:04.990 --> 46:06.990
- Now, wait a minute, huh?

46:06.990 --> 46:08.883
I got to draw the line right there!

46:11.382 --> 46:14.060
Boy, you watch how you talk to your aunt.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.610
- You respect your elders, boy.

46:19.550 --> 46:21.100
- Now, I don't like her either.

46:22.040 --> 46:23.420
She's got real bad gas

46:23.420 --> 46:26.433
and she's chases all the
neighborhood pets away, I know.

46:27.568 --> 46:30.650
And those claws that she calls nails,

46:30.650 --> 46:32.890
scraping up my hardwood floor.

46:32.890 --> 46:37.530
These was new hardwood
floors, but she is your aunt.

46:39.450 --> 46:41.437
She practically raised you as her own.

46:43.060 --> 46:43.900
- That's right.

46:43.900 --> 46:44.987
- Apologize, to her.

46:49.370 --> 46:50.270
Apologize, to her.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.253
I said apologize!

47:01.050 --> 47:03.793
- I'm sorry, Auntie Barbara.

47:05.350 --> 47:07.400
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

47:11.370 --> 47:12.520
- Right, you was wrong.

47:15.240 --> 47:16.790
Let you slide this time, Jonas.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.667
The next time you won't
even see it coming.

47:25.777 --> 47:26.853
- Oh boy.

47:26.853 --> 47:29.403
- It'd be like a Sunday afternoon game.

47:32.740 --> 47:36.947
Come in like a line backer
and knock you on your...

47:37.810 --> 47:40.110
aspirin out. You got an aspirin, Flo.

47:40.110 --> 47:40.943
- I need a cigarette.

47:40.943 --> 47:43.320
- Wait, wait, you got some weed?

47:43.320 --> 47:45.103
- Charlie, what is wrong wit you?

47:45.103 --> 47:47.600
Charlie, what is...
- I got them cataracts in

47:47.600 --> 47:48.433
my eyes!

47:48.433 --> 47:50.380
- Wait, wait, now. We don't puff puff

47:50.380 --> 47:52.960
the magic dragon in this house.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.060
You gonna have to take that mess out back,

47:55.980 --> 47:58.173
where your aunt buries all her bones.

48:00.257 --> 48:03.821
- You know what? I've had
enough. You, people are crazy.

48:03.821 --> 48:06.334
(everyone speaks at once)

48:06.334 --> 48:08.447
- Jasmine, Jasmine, where you goin'?

48:08.447 --> 48:10.080
- I need to be alone.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.770
- (chuckles), bye.

48:11.770 --> 48:13.120
Ain't nobody goin miss her.

48:14.920 --> 48:15.753
- You know what?

48:17.100 --> 48:18.690
I'm outta here too, you know what?

48:18.690 --> 48:22.183
I am tired of everything
being about you Jonas!

48:25.001 --> 48:26.820
Here it is mom's birthday

48:26.820 --> 48:29.073
and somehow all the focus is on you.

48:37.524 --> 48:38.630
I bet you don't even know,

48:38.630 --> 48:43.630
this party is also for mom
being in remission from cancer.

48:44.094 --> 48:44.927
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:46.626 --> 48:47.830
- Mom, you had cancer?

48:49.570 --> 48:51.710
- That's right, mom had cancer

48:51.710 --> 48:52.750
and they didn't wanna tell you

48:52.750 --> 48:55.200
and worry you during your
little football season.

48:56.180 --> 48:57.916
- Ma, come on, had I had known,

48:57.916 --> 49:00.196
then I would've been here.
- Known what? You still

49:00.196 --> 49:01.033
wouldn't have been here!

49:01.033 --> 49:03.927
When does the superstar have time for us!?

49:05.478 --> 49:09.137
Huh? Nah, while you've
been off bein' a superstar,

49:11.080 --> 49:13.233
I've been here being a son.

49:16.006 --> 49:17.373
You know who's name Nate called?

49:18.890 --> 49:22.790
Yours, but that's all goin'
to change, you know what?

49:22.790 --> 49:26.973
I can't take it, mom, I'm
sorry we ruined your birthday.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.107
I'm out.

49:30.107 --> 49:30.940
- Don't leave.
- Come on D, don't...

49:30.940 --> 49:34.043
- Derek, Derek, Derek!

49:35.390 --> 49:36.223
I'll get him.

49:40.324 --> 49:43.490
- All I wanted, was to
have family come together

49:43.490 --> 49:45.620
this weekend for my birthday

49:45.620 --> 49:47.010
and what's it come to?

49:47.940 --> 49:51.053
A hot glorified mess.
- Um um, um, um.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.948
- Ma, can we please just
talk about this later?

49:54.948 --> 49:57.679
- Oh yeah, we can talk about it,

49:57.679 --> 50:00.240
but right now, this is my birthday dinner

50:00.240 --> 50:03.530
and I am determined to enjoy myself.

50:03.530 --> 50:04.363
- Yes ma'am.

50:06.863 --> 50:08.640
- All right, everybody let's eat.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.159
- All right.

50:10.159 --> 50:12.992
(R&B music plays)

50:27.428 --> 50:29.178
- [Johnny] Hey Derek!

50:37.967 --> 50:40.543
(Barbara and Lisa talking)

50:40.543 --> 50:42.720
- It's just like the men to disappear,

50:42.720 --> 50:44.127
I'm telling ya now, when it's time

50:44.127 --> 50:45.840
for the domestic work to be done.

50:45.840 --> 50:48.281
- The meal was delicious, thank you.

50:48.281 --> 50:49.114
- Yeah it was good.
- (chuckling).

50:49.114 --> 50:50.470
- Anyone for some coffee?

50:50.470 --> 50:51.885
- Oh, I'll take a cup, thank you so much.

50:51.885 --> 50:55.330
- Ooohhh, no honey, you know
coffee don't agree wit' me.

50:55.330 --> 50:58.930
It just keeps me up and gives me gas.

50:58.930 --> 51:00.907
Y'all know what happened
last time to you, don't you?

51:00.907 --> 51:02.137
- Um hm.
- (chuckling).

51:02.137 --> 51:04.214
- Killed all the house plants too.

51:04.214 --> 51:06.200
- Ooohhh (laughing)!

51:06.200 --> 51:07.470
So, where did everyone else go?

51:07.470 --> 51:10.130
- They all went to go find Derek, baby.

51:10.130 --> 51:12.160
I'm just so worried about my baby.

51:12.160 --> 51:13.980
- Yeah, you know he's at that age.

51:13.980 --> 51:16.260
Tryin' to figure it out
(indistinct) isn't easy.

51:16.260 --> 51:17.760
- You know, you that same sweet girl

51:17.760 --> 51:18.593
they left here years ago.

51:18.593 --> 51:20.110
- Awwww.
- Yes, you are.

51:20.110 --> 51:21.660
Yes, you are.
- In some ways I am,

51:21.660 --> 51:23.290
but a lot has happened since college.

51:23.290 --> 51:24.670
- Um
- I know.

51:24.670 --> 51:25.770
- We see that.

51:25.770 --> 51:27.420
You all woman now.
- (laughing).

51:28.420 --> 51:30.410
- Whhoooo, girl, you got to tell us,

51:30.410 --> 51:33.070
you got to tell us about
them gorgeous New York men.

51:33.070 --> 51:36.220
Ooohhh, I know you got
some stories to tell.

51:36.220 --> 51:38.663
Child, I got to live
vicariously through you.

51:41.097 --> 51:43.469
You know since my husband died,

51:43.469 --> 51:45.300
I ain't been gettin' no action

51:45.300 --> 51:46.880
and you know, Flo.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.330
She ain't got no story that
lasts longer than two minutes.

51:49.330 --> 51:51.140
- Shut up.
- (chuckling).

51:51.140 --> 51:52.408
- It's the truth.

51:52.408 --> 51:53.593
(all laughing)

51:53.593 --> 51:55.483
- Auntie, there hasn't been anyone.

51:57.010 --> 51:57.843
- Nobody?

51:58.840 --> 52:02.310
- No, since college,
no, I work all the time,

52:02.310 --> 52:04.853
so there's no wild stories to tell.

52:06.050 --> 52:09.432
- Okay, not even a little one
night stand here, there huh?

52:09.432 --> 52:10.957
- (chuckling) No.

52:10.957 --> 52:12.617
- Oh, what about a little bump and grind?

52:12.617 --> 52:15.010
Huh? I don't see nothin' wrong

52:15.010 --> 52:16.710
wit' a little bump and grind, huh!

52:17.740 --> 52:19.293
That keeps ya focused baby.

52:20.580 --> 52:22.200
- No one.

52:22.200 --> 52:27.200
- Oh, I just assumed
somebody was tearin' that up.

52:28.674 --> 52:30.252
- Huh?

52:30.252 --> 52:32.820
You know when a woman ain't
gettin' none, I'm telling you,

52:32.820 --> 52:37.820
she be mean, and cankerous like, like me.

52:38.517 --> 52:40.075
- But you sweet as pie baby.

52:40.075 --> 52:41.099
(everyone laughs)

52:41.099 --> 52:42.650
- Yes you are, yes you are.

52:42.650 --> 52:46.130
- Like many of my friends,
I'm not into casual sex.

52:46.130 --> 52:48.182
I connect sex with being
with the person I love

52:48.182 --> 52:50.134
and wanna spend the rest of my life with,

52:50.134 --> 52:50.967
- Hmmm.

52:50.967 --> 52:52.760
- but I wanna get married.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.620
- Amen baby, do it God's way.

52:54.620 --> 52:58.263
- That's beautiful, but tomorrow
ain't promised to you baby.

52:59.170 --> 53:00.913
You better get you some, hmmm?

53:02.240 --> 53:06.700
Um hmm, yes. Get it while it's moist.

53:06.700 --> 53:08.150
- Ummm.
- Yeah, 'cause when time

53:08.150 --> 53:12.204
will pass baby and you'd be
dryer than the Sahara desert.

53:12.204 --> 53:13.700
(all laugh)
- I'm telling you somethin',

53:13.700 --> 53:16.852
I'm talkin' from experience
honey, the struggle is real.

53:16.852 --> 53:17.685
- (laughs)

53:17.685 --> 53:18.518
- Auntie, I'll (indistinct)

53:18.518 --> 53:19.990
- It's real.
- I see.

53:19.990 --> 53:20.918
- Yes.

53:20.918 --> 53:25.014
- (chuckling)
Get it baby.

53:25.014 --> 53:26.514
- [Johnny] DEREK!?

53:29.238 --> 53:30.071
DEREK!?

53:40.886 --> 53:41.719
DEREK!?

53:41.719 --> 53:44.750
- Baby listen, you know, I try not to pry

53:44.750 --> 53:48.300
and I tried to stay out of
you and Jonas' business,

53:48.300 --> 53:49.423
- Until now, hell.

53:50.840 --> 53:53.483
- Baby, what happened
between you and Jonas?

53:53.483 --> 53:56.060
He doesn't talk about it.

53:56.060 --> 53:57.588
- My heart was broken.

53:57.588 --> 53:58.421
- Um.

54:00.630 --> 54:04.010
- It's like a whirlwind of
emotions just came rushing back.

54:04.010 --> 54:05.710
Feelings that I thought were gone.

54:23.540 --> 54:25.440
- Where you think you goin'?

54:25.440 --> 54:27.900
- Nowhere, man. I'm here.

54:27.900 --> 54:28.890
- Punkin' out?

54:28.890 --> 54:30.430
- Nah, let's go.

54:30.430 --> 54:32.440
- All right, follow me.

54:32.440 --> 54:33.373
- Let's do this!

54:36.637 --> 54:38.390
- But baby, you held it together.

54:38.390 --> 54:39.223
- Um hm.

54:40.260 --> 54:44.357
- Um hm, yes you did, 'cause
I would've slapped the taste

54:44.357 --> 54:47.400
out of Jasmine's mouth, I
mean that, yes, I would've.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.110
- It wasn't easy.
- I believe you.

54:49.110 --> 54:51.450
- After all these years I
can't believe I still love him.

54:51.450 --> 54:56.450
- Ha! (clapping) I knew
it, I knew it! Um um um.

54:56.600 --> 54:59.890
- If falling out of love is so hard,

54:59.890 --> 55:02.740
why is that? Like, how
do you turn love off?

55:02.740 --> 55:04.990
- You can't!
- You can't turn that off,

55:04.990 --> 55:06.379
baby.

55:06.379 --> 55:09.279
And it seem like you ain't
ready to just move on, are you?

55:10.910 --> 55:13.093
But you got to tell us what happened.

55:14.950 --> 55:19.920
- Things changed. You know,
when we went to college,

55:19.920 --> 55:21.814
the us became about him.

55:21.814 --> 55:23.390
- Um.

55:23.390 --> 55:25.743
- Then there was a
popularity and the girls.

55:26.850 --> 55:30.070
Long story short. I caught
him with a girl in his room.

55:30.070 --> 55:32.963
- NO! And you didn't call me?

55:34.010 --> 55:36.170
Came up there and set
it off, you know that?

55:36.170 --> 55:37.950
- Baby, I didn't know he cheated on you,

55:37.950 --> 55:40.520
honey I raised him better than that.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.353
- Yes.

55:42.510 --> 55:46.940
- Yeah, you know, I just, that
day I ran back to the dorm,

55:46.940 --> 55:50.020
I packed my things, I left that night.

55:50.020 --> 55:52.663
I transferred to another
college, I never looked back.

55:54.015 --> 55:55.770
- Um, um, um.

55:55.770 --> 55:58.520
- Seems to me that you two
have some unresolved issues,

56:00.426 --> 56:02.920
but if you two still have feelings,

56:02.920 --> 56:04.240
maybe things can work out.

56:04.240 --> 56:07.130
- Nah Flo, now I love
Jonas like my own son,

56:07.130 --> 56:09.660
but he was wrong, what
he did was wrong baby

56:09.660 --> 56:12.060
and who's to say he wouldn't do it again.

56:12.060 --> 56:13.710
Men, money, and power, I'm telling you,

56:13.710 --> 56:15.810
that's a dangerous combination.

56:15.810 --> 56:18.986
It is for you know, God forgives.

56:18.986 --> 56:20.725

57:05.280 --> 57:07.637
- Man, you got baby lungs.
- Yeah (indistinct).

57:11.460 --> 57:13.963
- Baby, you got to seize the moment.

57:14.810 --> 57:16.803
Sometimes you only get one chance.

57:18.058 --> 57:20.130
I remember when I was
dating this other young man,

57:20.130 --> 57:22.863
and Johnny had eyes for me,

57:23.920 --> 57:26.506
everybody in my family
loved this young man,

57:26.506 --> 57:28.042
because he was perfect.
- Yes!

57:28.042 --> 57:30.390
- Good family and marked for success.

57:30.390 --> 57:35.020
- Um hm, Kevin, um hm, I
liked him. I wanted him.

57:37.402 --> 57:40.980
Oh yeah, I did. Who didn't (chuckles).

57:40.980 --> 57:42.710
- Then there was Johnny.

57:45.800 --> 57:48.530
Johnny was from the poor side of town,

57:48.530 --> 57:49.830
didn't have much to offer.

57:51.155 --> 57:54.696
Ooohhhh, sugar wugar, baby, darling, dear!

57:54.696 --> 57:55.540
(chuckles)
- Um.

57:55.540 --> 57:57.483
Johnny made me feel so special.

57:59.570 --> 58:01.703
I loved him before I even knew I did.

58:03.850 --> 58:05.810
- What do you mean by that?

58:05.810 --> 58:09.200
- See, one day I heard that
Johnny was leaving town

58:10.483 --> 58:12.330
and I didn't know if
I'd ever see him again

58:12.330 --> 58:14.050
or if he'd ever come back.

58:14.050 --> 58:14.883
- Um.

58:16.093 --> 58:18.443
- But I knew that if I
didn't seize the moment,

58:19.690 --> 58:22.403
I'd lose out on my once
in a lifetime love.

58:24.270 --> 58:28.480
Baby, that's the day,
I told him I loved him.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.723
- That is a beautiful story Mom Johnson.

58:31.970 --> 58:32.820
- Thank you baby.

58:33.735 --> 58:35.656
Gives me goosebumps, ooohhhh,

58:35.656 --> 58:36.489

58:36.489 --> 58:37.937
(all chuckles)

58:37.937 --> 58:41.040
- (yawning) Oh, excuse me.

58:41.040 --> 58:42.850
I'm getting a little restless.

58:42.850 --> 58:44.430
I'm gonna go ahead and
head to my parent's house

58:44.430 --> 58:45.910
and get some rest.

58:45.910 --> 58:47.590
- No baby, stay right here.
- Yes.

58:47.590 --> 58:48.517
- Got plenty of space.

58:48.517 --> 58:49.590
- But what about Jonas?

58:49.590 --> 58:53.100

1:00:09.990 --> 1:00:13.260
- Chris!? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:00:13.260 --> 1:00:15.303
I ain't seen him in a month of Sundays.

1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:18.357
That boy was so jealous of you.

1:00:18.357 --> 1:00:21.830
- Who Chris? Nah pops, come on man.

1:00:21.830 --> 1:00:25.594

1:00:25.594 --> 1:00:26.960
(all laughs)

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:29.200
Charlie, this boy breath was so bad,

1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:31.220
it's like he walked in wit a stranger

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.290

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:41.963
- Nah. Anything other than a black woman.

1:02:47.530 --> 1:02:50.509
- Boy, you better get out my
house, talkin' that crazy mess!

1:02:50.509 --> 1:02:52.450

1:03:34.260 --> 1:03:35.610
- What you say?

1:03:35.610 --> 1:03:38.610
- She would've just taken
the trash out herself.

1:03:38.610 --> 1:03:42.310
The only interruption, is
bringin' me an ice cold beer.

1:03:42.310 --> 1:03:44.260
- Now he does have a point there, pops.

1:03:46.390 --> 1:03:48.460
Certain women just get it, pops.

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:50.277
Now we men, so we real simple, right?

1:03:50.277 --> 1:03:52.400
All we care about is women that can cook,

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:56.466
give us peace of mind and great sex!

1:03:56.466 --> 1:03:57.320
(chuckles)

1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.790
- Speaking of which,

1:03:59.790 --> 1:04:02.280
- Wait, stop right there (laughing),

1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:04.030
I'm not goin' sit here and listen to this.

1:04:04.030 --> 1:04:07.690
You ain't never been with

1:04:07.690 --> 1:04:09.447
- Man, I have!

1:04:09.447 --> 1:04:11.200

1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:14.120

1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:17.477

1:04:18.365 --> 1:04:20.710

I told you bout her!
- Sho nuff.

1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:24.220

Yo mother backed that thing up on me like,

1:04:39.370 --> 1:04:41.470
'Cause look pops, times

1:04:41.470 --> 1:04:44.420
People have evolved
since your ancient era.

1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:46.090
- No, no, son.

1:04:46.090 --> 1:04:49.090
The problem is young people today,

1:04:49.090 --> 1:04:51.330
believe whatever the media tells them.

1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:54.640
The media lies to us son.

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:57.680
The media, they lie to us
every day to try to get us

1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:59.393
to do what they want us to do.

1:05:01.490 --> 1:05:02.573
Like puppets.

1:05:05.710 --> 1:05:10.710
We see it, we believe it.
Don't follow the crowd boys.

1:05:12.636 --> 1:05:13.469
- AYE!

1:05:15.589 --> 1:05:18.182
This yo boy, you go first!

- Yeah! Let's go!

1:05:20.743 --> 1:05:24.826
(gang proceeds to jump Derek in)

1:05:37.959 --> 1:05:39.292
- That's enough.

1:05:51.045 --> 1:05:54.295
(gang talking at once)

1:06:19.516 --> 1:06:21.705
- Come on, I got you, man.

1:06:21.705 --> 1:06:22.538
Come on.

1:06:29.850 --> 1:06:33.180
- Okay, I hear you. Case and point,

1:06:33.180 --> 1:06:34.620
Jonas, remember the type of car

1:06:34.620 --> 1:06:36.820
I drove in college?
- Yeah, little hoopty, Chevy

1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:38.361
hatchback, yeah.
- (laughing),

1:06:38.361 --> 1:06:39.194
yeah that.

1:06:39.194 --> 1:06:43.480
Anyway, I was tryin to
holla at the sistas.

1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:44.990
They didn't wanna talk to me,

1:06:44.990 --> 1:06:46.670
because the type of car I drove.

1:06:46.670 --> 1:06:49.270
- Wait a minute, wait, wait,
how'd you get your head,

1:06:49.270 --> 1:06:51.555
yo big old head in that little bitty car?

1:06:51.555 --> 1:06:52.983
- (laughing).
- Better yet, how'd you get

1:06:52.983 --> 1:06:53.816
another brother

1:06:53.816 --> 1:06:55.426
in the car wit' you?
- (laughing).

1:06:55.426 --> 1:06:56.930
- Wasn't no room in the car, Charlie!

1:06:56.930 --> 1:07:00.063
- Any way, I didn't have
a lot of money back then.

1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:03.100
I couldn't afford to take 'em places

1:07:03.100 --> 1:07:05.210
and buy 'em expensive things

1:07:05.210 --> 1:07:08.950
and they was always sayin'
stuff like you talk too white

1:07:08.950 --> 1:07:13.123
or relax, you walk too stiff.

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:16.233
- You do.

1:07:16.233 --> 1:07:18.470
- Okay, okay, but look,

1:07:18.470 --> 1:07:21.747
I was never black enough for the sistas.

1:07:28.470 --> 1:07:29.393
So, guess what?

1:07:30.970 --> 1:07:33.005
I stopped comin' their way.

1:07:33.005 --> 1:07:36.749
- Yeah, yeah, get it all out, yeah.

1:07:36.749 --> 1:07:37.858
Is that it?

1:07:37.858 --> 1:07:40.200
- I don't know Johnny,
the boy kind of preachin'.

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.380
Shut up Charlie!

1:07:41.380 --> 1:07:44.893
- But, let me tell you
when my life changed.

1:07:47.010 --> 1:07:49.003
When I started datin' other races.

1:07:51.340 --> 1:07:54.150
They didn't ridicule me
for not having money.

1:07:54.150 --> 1:07:57.206
In fact, they saw what I could become,

1:07:57.206 --> 1:07:59.150
- What you could become?

1:07:59.150 --> 1:08:00.983
- but when a brother made a come up,

1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:03.893
started driving that Bentley,

1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:08.280
all the sistas wanted one.

1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:12.810
I'm like, "Oh, now you
wanna holla at a brotha."

1:08:12.810 --> 1:08:13.713
It's too late!

1:08:14.630 --> 1:08:17.633
I started throwing up my own stop sign.

1:08:20.090 --> 1:08:22.590
- Boy, sit yo $5 butt down!
- (laughing).

1:08:22.590 --> 1:08:24.162
- Boy, I'll make change on you.

1:08:24.162 --> 1:08:27.416
- Okay!
- (laughing).

1:08:27.416 --> 1:08:31.760
- Yeah boy, you are suffering
from Black Dateless Syndrome,

1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:33.040
that's all that is (chuckles).

1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:36.546
- Look here, my office
hours are nine to five.

1:08:36.546 --> 1:08:38.782
- (laughing) Maybe his
shirt's too tight, Charlie.

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:39.615
- (laughing).

1:08:39.615 --> 1:08:42.610
- Boy I swear, does it snap
in the middle, like a leotard?

1:08:42.610 --> 1:08:44.250
- Yeah, I think I saw one of his balls

1:08:44.250 --> 1:08:45.728
hanging off to the side too.

1:08:45.728 --> 1:08:47.764
- Ugh (laughing).

1:08:47.764 --> 1:08:49.559
Ugh, ugh!
- (laughing).

1:08:49.559 --> 1:08:52.229
- Man, don't worry about it.
- (laughing).

1:08:52.229 --> 1:08:54.830
- What you laughin' at?
With that goat shirt on.

1:08:54.830 --> 1:08:57.120
Mariachi or somethin'
like that (indistinct).

1:08:57.120 --> 1:08:58.430
- Well, my sponsor pays
me to wear this shirt,

1:08:58.430 --> 1:08:59.733
so it don't matter, sir.

1:09:02.350 --> 1:09:06.389
- Anyway, I'm tellin' you, black love,

1:09:06.389 --> 1:09:08.590
good black love still exists.

1:09:08.590 --> 1:09:10.036
- Um hm.

1:09:10.036 --> 1:09:13.375
- And look here, no woman is perfect

1:09:13.375 --> 1:09:15.840
and there's good and bad in every race,

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:17.941
but the problem with you young fellas is,

1:09:17.941 --> 1:09:20.740
y'all's too busy following the trends!

1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:23.210
You need to get with a
woman that's good for you,

1:09:23.210 --> 1:09:24.649
no matter what her race is.

1:09:24.649 --> 1:09:28.190
- See your mother, I tell
ya, man, she was with me

1:09:28.190 --> 1:09:31.300
when I didn't have two
nickels to rub together.

1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:33.843
I couldn't even afford to
buy her a wedding ring.

1:09:35.479 --> 1:09:39.399
I take it in a string and I
tied it around her finger,

1:09:39.399 --> 1:09:42.013
promised to buy her diamond ring someday.

1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:45.490
Your mother wore that
string around her finger

1:09:45.490 --> 1:09:48.420
proud all that time and never cared about

1:09:48.420 --> 1:09:50.473
what anybody had to say about it.

1:09:51.850 --> 1:09:54.559
- Wait, wait, wait, pops, this story true?

1:09:54.559 --> 1:09:55.930
- Huh?
- Huh? Is it true?

1:09:55.930 --> 1:09:56.763
- You mean...

1:09:56.763 --> 1:09:57.900
Nah, nah, it wasn't true.

1:09:57.900 --> 1:09:59.570
- Johnny, man dang!
- Come on pops, man!

1:09:59.570 --> 1:10:01.240
- You know what I'm saying?

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:02.490
The point, listen to what I'm sayin'!

1:10:02.490 --> 1:10:03.730
The point is...

1:10:05.639 --> 1:10:08.543
your mother is a good woman!

1:10:08.543 --> 1:10:11.800
- Um hmm, Flo's a good
woman and she thick too.

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:12.870
- Hey, watch your mouth.

1:10:12.870 --> 1:10:14.930
Hey, that's enough about
my wife's onion, all right?

1:10:14.930 --> 1:10:15.763
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:10:16.915 --> 1:10:20.170
- Now, at the end of the day, your mother,

1:10:20.170 --> 1:10:23.710
she holds me down and
at the end of the day,

1:10:23.710 --> 1:10:25.021
that's what every man needs.

1:10:25.021 --> 1:10:25.853
- Um hmm.

1:10:25.853 --> 1:10:27.590
And you know, for years, black women

1:10:27.590 --> 1:10:30.365
have been gettin' a bad
rap for bein' strong,

1:10:30.365 --> 1:10:31.198
- Um.

1:10:31.198 --> 1:10:33.280
- but most people fail to
realize why they needed to.

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:34.800
- Educate these youngsters, Charlie.

1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:37.960
- Um hmm, well look here, they
raisin' sons with no father.

1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:38.793
- Yes.

1:10:38.793 --> 1:10:41.309
- We got 2 million imprisoned black men

1:10:41.309 --> 1:10:42.700
and most with no fathers.

1:10:42.700 --> 1:10:46.600
- That's right, Jay, you
always tryin' to get me

1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:48.660
to move out of this neighborhood.

1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:52.503
These young boys need us,
but I'll make you a deal.

1:10:53.420 --> 1:10:55.130
You build that community center,

1:10:55.130 --> 1:10:59.610
you start those programs and
I'll entertain your offer

1:10:59.610 --> 1:11:01.170
to buy me a house.

1:11:01.170 --> 1:11:03.200
- Okay, that's a deal, pops.

1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:04.032
- All right.

1:11:04.032 --> 1:11:05.180
- Hold up!

1:11:05.180 --> 1:11:06.820
How did we get on this topic?

1:11:06.820 --> 1:11:08.320
- You, knucklehead (laughing)!

1:11:09.522 --> 1:11:11.977
- You know what? You two failed to mention

1:11:11.977 --> 1:11:14.980
the two most important
things in a relationship.

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:17.830
- Talk about it, Charlie.
- And that's love and respect.

1:11:17.830 --> 1:11:18.860
- Yes, sir.

1:11:18.860 --> 1:11:22.109
Now for a woman's got those two things,

1:11:22.109 --> 1:11:23.959
oohh Lord, she'll do anything to you.

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:27.100
- Charlie, you mean
anything for you, right?

1:11:27.100 --> 1:11:27.933
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

1:11:27.933 --> 1:11:29.230
- Yes.
- (chuckling).

1:11:29.230 --> 1:11:30.900
- Now Jonas, look here.

1:11:30.900 --> 1:11:33.500
I saw how you was lookin' at Lisa earlier.

1:11:33.500 --> 1:11:35.870
- Yeah, yeah, I had to
keep my eye on Jesus

1:11:35.870 --> 1:11:36.829
when she walked in.

1:11:36.829 --> 1:11:38.502
- Whhoooo, oooohhhh, ooohhh,

1:11:38.502 --> 1:11:40.202
little sweet tenderoni (laughing)!

1:11:41.492 --> 1:11:43.360
- Yeah, she's still lookin' good, man,

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.450
but look, she left me.
I mean just disappeared.

1:11:46.450 --> 1:11:47.960
- Well, what did you do?

1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:50.180
- Pops to this day I have no idea, man.

1:11:50.180 --> 1:11:53.139
- Wait, am I missing something?

1:11:53.139 --> 1:11:54.210
Lisa's in town?

1:11:54.210 --> 1:11:56.147
- Yeah and she looks amazing man

1:11:56.147 --> 1:11:57.280
and the cold part about it,

1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:59.030
I couldn't even hide it from Jasmine.

1:11:59.030 --> 1:12:02.164
- Sounds like y'all got
unfinished business.

1:12:02.164 --> 1:12:05.100
- (chuckles) Yep, you still love Lisa?

1:12:05.100 --> 1:12:09.127
- Why would he go back to
Lisa? Remember she left him.

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:12.760
- All right, y'all ain't
tryin' to play no cards.

1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:15.530
Listen, I'm startin'
to feel like Dr. Phil.

1:12:15.530 --> 1:12:17.230
I'm goin' to bed

1:12:17.230 --> 1:12:19.397
and Derek better get
his butt in this house.

1:12:19.397 --> 1:12:20.980
- Wait, now I still need to deduct

1:12:20.980 --> 1:12:22.430
my social security check now!

1:12:25.130 --> 1:12:27.493
- I know you're not
seriously considering this.

1:12:28.546 --> 1:12:30.309
- Aye man, I owe it to
myself to see what happened

1:12:30.309 --> 1:12:32.530
between us and if they're
still something between us.

1:12:32.530 --> 1:12:37.020
- No man, she had a chance
bro, a woman like Lisa,

1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:39.059
she doesn't deserve men like us.

1:12:39.059 --> 1:12:41.889
- Hold on, why do you care who I'm with?

1:12:41.889 --> 1:12:43.980
- Come on Jay, man,

1:12:43.980 --> 1:12:45.780
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

1:12:47.410 --> 1:12:48.243
- I respect that

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:56.820
- Yo Jay, what happened to D, man?

1:12:58.770 --> 1:13:00.793
- Ayo pops! Pops!

1:13:01.750 --> 1:13:03.150
- What happened Jay?

1:13:03.150 --> 1:13:06.120
- Derek, what happened to my son!?

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:07.477
I'm not gonna ask you again,

1:13:07.477 --> 1:13:08.895
what happened to my son!?

1:13:08.895 --> 1:13:10.093
- It was a gang initiation!

1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:14.460
- Got you lil bro.
- Come on Flo, answer the

1:13:14.460 --> 1:13:15.293
phone.

1:13:15.293 --> 1:13:16.950
Answer the phone!

1:13:16.950 --> 1:13:19.270
- Yo Chris, need you to hold
the spot down for me, man.

1:13:19.270 --> 1:13:20.103
- I got you.

1:13:20.103 --> 1:13:22.210
- Anybody call, we at
the Bayview Hospital.

1:13:22.210 --> 1:13:23.950
- Somethin' bad happened to Derek!

1:13:23.950 --> 1:13:26.250
Meet us at the at the Bayview Hospital!

1:13:26.250 --> 1:13:27.713
- You're goin' be all right, dog.

1:13:38.555 --> 1:13:40.472
- Oh man, this place...

1:14:03.367 --> 1:14:05.617
- Mama Johnson is that you?

1:14:07.800 --> 1:14:08.633
Who's there?

1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:11.693
- It's Chris.

1:14:12.700 --> 1:14:14.969
Lisa!? Is that you?

1:14:14.969 --> 1:14:16.230
- Chris? What are you doing here?

1:14:16.230 --> 1:14:18.620
- I can ask you the same.

1:14:18.620 --> 1:14:21.702
- I was upstairs taking a
nap when I heard noises.

1:14:21.702 --> 1:14:22.840
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

1:14:22.840 --> 1:14:24.809
- I bet you weren't,

1:14:24.809 --> 1:14:26.930
I reached out to you a few times, but...

1:14:28.210 --> 1:14:29.230
- Where is everyone?

1:14:29.230 --> 1:14:32.410
- You mean Jay, Jasmine
(indistinct) for something,

1:14:32.410 --> 1:14:34.683
but everyone else, I'm not sure.

1:14:35.650 --> 1:14:39.814
- Okay, it's gettin' late, I'ma
go turn it in for the night.

1:14:39.814 --> 1:14:41.490
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:14:41.490 --> 1:14:44.000
You don't gotta be so quick to leave.

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.300
Why don't you stay and you know,

1:14:45.300 --> 1:14:47.150
keep me company til everyone returns?

1:14:48.570 --> 1:14:51.943
- Why Chris? Remember? I was
never good enough for Jonas.

1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:53.612
- Hmm.

1:14:53.612 --> 1:14:57.120
You remembered that. We were kids,

1:14:57.120 --> 1:14:58.830
let's leave the past in the past.

1:14:58.830 --> 1:15:02.143
Besides, I was just tryin'
to protect you from Jay.

1:15:03.867 --> 1:15:07.469
- Derek! Hang in there Derek!
We got you man! Hang in there!

1:15:07.469 --> 1:15:09.450
Go! Hurry up! Go! Go!

1:15:09.450 --> 1:15:10.800
- Go home and wait for your mama,

1:15:10.800 --> 1:15:12.360
just in case she doesn't get my message.

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:13.193
- Okay.

1:15:13.193 --> 1:15:15.163
- Derek, hold on, son. Hold on now.

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:19.937
Pull up right here in the
front, right here in the front!

1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:02.889
- And I'm supposed to thank you?

1:16:02.889 --> 1:16:05.100
And why the hell you keep
sending pictures to my DM's?

1:16:05.100 --> 1:16:06.593
'Cause we're not friends!

1:16:06.593 --> 1:16:10.600
- I did what I did for
you. You a sweet girl.

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:12.080
- What are you doin'?

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:15.570
- Remember, I liked you first,
Jay just got in the way.

1:16:15.570 --> 1:16:17.870
I guess you like that
football star type, huh?

1:16:19.180 --> 1:16:22.309
Back then I was just this tall,
skinny kid wit' a big head,

1:16:22.309 --> 1:16:25.260
but I'm all grown up now.

1:16:25.260 --> 1:16:29.397
- Um and clearly I see you've
grown into your big ego too.

1:16:29.397 --> 1:16:31.282
- And a bank account to match it.

1:16:32.700 --> 1:16:34.760
I see the way you be lookin' at me.

1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:36.570
- I'm looking? Nah, see you got it all..

1:16:36.570 --> 1:16:39.393
- Wrong? I don't think so.

1:16:41.770 --> 1:16:44.700
This is a time for us
to finally be together.

1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:46.860
I don't see what you saw in Jay, anyway.

1:16:46.860 --> 1:16:50.280
- What? Be together, nah
Chris, see now you trippin.

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:53.883
- Look, I was the one
deserving of you, not Jay.

1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:59.693
Everything was given to him
and he never appreciated it.

1:17:01.590 --> 1:17:03.290
- I've never felt that way about you.

1:17:03.290 --> 1:17:06.889
It's always been about
Jonas, never about you.

1:17:06.889 --> 1:17:11.889
- Jonas, Jonas, Jonas.
I'm so tired of that name.

1:17:13.850 --> 1:17:15.853
- Leave now and maybe I won't tell him

1:17:15.853 --> 1:17:18.020
what his supposedly best friend said.

1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:20.750
- FORGET JAY! You know you want this!

1:17:20.750 --> 1:17:21.800
- What!?

1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:22.633
Chris, no!

1:17:23.990 --> 1:17:25.889
- Lord, I'm so glad I charged up my phone,

1:17:25.889 --> 1:17:28.690
I would've never gotten
that message from Johnny!

1:17:28.690 --> 1:17:29.639
Oh God (panicking)!

1:17:30.547 --> 1:17:33.050
- [Passenger] Now, I lay me
down to sleep, I pray the Lord

1:17:33.050 --> 1:17:34.448
my soul to keep.

1:17:34.448 --> 1:17:37.280
Lord, (indistinct)!

1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:39.240
- I'll take what I want,

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.793
rather you wanna give it to me or not.

1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:45.730
Go ahead, go ahead. Beg for it.

1:17:45.730 --> 1:17:46.733
- Chris stop!

1:17:49.740 --> 1:17:52.133
- Go ahead, beg for it.

1:17:53.733 --> 1:17:56.433
- You trippin'.
- I'll like it even more.

1:17:56.433 --> 1:17:57.540
- Get off of me!
- I can't stand women

1:17:57.540 --> 1:17:58.373
like you!

1:17:59.611 --> 1:18:01.730
Think you're too good for a brother!

1:18:01.730 --> 1:18:02.920
- Chris, think about what you're doing,

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:04.580
you're making a big mistake.

1:18:04.580 --> 1:18:05.859
Someone can walk in here, anyone.

1:18:05.859 --> 1:18:07.250
- SO!!

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:11.943
No one's gonna believe you!
It's my word, against yours!

1:18:13.584 --> 1:18:14.629
- Chris stop!

1:18:14.629 --> 1:18:17.530
Chris stop it, what are you doing?

1:18:17.530 --> 1:18:19.330
- Hey man! The hell's goin' on in here!?

1:18:19.330 --> 1:18:20.570
- He tried to rape me!

1:18:20.570 --> 1:18:21.800
- Tried to rape you?
What's wrong wit' you!

1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:23.737
- Man, ain't nobody try to rape that girl!

1:18:23.737 --> 1:18:25.570
- Time for you to leave, Chris.

1:18:25.570 --> 1:18:27.530
- So it's like that, man?

1:18:27.530 --> 1:18:28.940
You just gonna believe her?
- Hey hey! One thing I know

1:18:28.940 --> 1:18:31.202
about Lisa, she ain't a liar, dude!

1:18:32.719 --> 1:18:35.853
- So, it's like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

1:18:36.858 --> 1:18:38.050
All this damn time, you've
been tryin' to make me

1:18:38.050 --> 1:18:39.520
stray away from Lisa, huh?

1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:41.120
Tryin' to block what God has had for me

1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:42.883
this whole time, right?

1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:47.969
- You know what you know?
You know I loved her first.

1:18:47.969 --> 1:18:49.070
- Huh?

1:18:49.070 --> 1:18:51.719
- All through high school and college.

1:18:51.719 --> 1:18:54.963
Man, you had the best
girls, the nicest cars,

1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:58.463
everything came so easy to Jonas.

1:19:00.070 --> 1:19:01.430
I was just 'posed to sit around

1:19:01.430 --> 1:19:03.440
and get yo sloppy seconds,

1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:07.790
but you know what, man,
she ain't all that anyway.

1:19:07.790 --> 1:19:09.820
- Okay, leave now before
I call the police!

1:19:09.820 --> 1:19:11.020
- All right (chuckling).

1:19:11.873 --> 1:19:14.124
- Hey, you okay?

1:19:14.124 --> 1:19:14.957
- Yeah, (indistinct).

1:19:14.957 --> 1:19:18.957
- Aye (chuckling), before I go,

1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:26.688
you ever wonder why
Lisa broke up with you?

1:19:26.688 --> 1:19:30.500
I would know, because I set it all up.

1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:32.448
- Chris, what are you
doing? Don't do this.

1:19:32.448 --> 1:19:33.990
- (laughing).
- What are you talking about?

1:19:33.990 --> 1:19:37.219
- Nothing Chris, please.
- Sweet Jasmine, glad you

1:19:37.219 --> 1:19:40.027
could make it, aye, we're all here

1:19:40.027 --> 1:19:41.430
and they need to know.

1:19:41.430 --> 1:19:42.621
- He doesn't need to know.

1:19:42.621 --> 1:19:43.650
- I don't need to know what Jasmine?

1:19:43.650 --> 1:19:45.916
- Nothing, Chris, please...
- Get!

1:19:45.916 --> 1:19:47.350
- No.
- What!?

1:19:47.350 --> 1:19:50.230
You like stories? I got
a doozy for you, bro.

1:19:50.230 --> 1:19:51.710
- Yeah, okay.

1:19:51.710 --> 1:19:53.073
- Once upon a time,

1:19:54.050 --> 1:19:57.240
I paid a girl to be in
your apartment naked,

1:19:57.240 --> 1:20:02.240
then I called Lisa, and I
told Lisa to come to your room

1:20:02.790 --> 1:20:07.790
and when Lisa got there,
sweet Jasmine was there.

1:20:08.090 --> 1:20:10.907
She answered the door butt
ass naked (chuckling).

1:20:12.050 --> 1:20:12.900
- Jasmine!?

1:20:12.900 --> 1:20:14.740
- So, that's where I know you from?

1:20:14.740 --> 1:20:17.850
- (chuckling) Just a little confession

1:20:18.710 --> 1:20:21.663
before we part ways, brother.

1:20:21.663 --> 1:20:24.200
- No, he's not worth it! he's not worth it

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:27.793
- Jonas, I'm sorry you
had to find out like this.

1:20:29.180 --> 1:20:30.730
You supposed to be my man, huh?

1:20:31.820 --> 1:20:33.650
How are y'all goin' do this to me?

1:20:33.650 --> 1:20:36.230
After all I did for you and you, huh!?

1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:40.070
- Jasmine ain't nothing but a gold digger.

1:20:40.070 --> 1:20:45.070
As for me, I got tired of
seeing everything go your way.

1:20:45.210 --> 1:20:49.396
Then you not giving a damn
about no one, but yoself.

1:20:49.396 --> 1:20:51.860
- Jonas, I was that person back
then, but I'm different now.

1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:53.492
I do love you.
- (laughing)

1:20:53.492 --> 1:20:55.173
- I do.
- Love, love.

1:20:56.170 --> 1:20:57.290
Is that the same love

1:20:57.290 --> 1:20:59.553
that just had you in
my bed earlier tonight?

1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:04.040
- You know you've been
bribing me since college.

1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:05.420
Jonas, I do love you.

1:21:05.420 --> 1:21:06.840
- Look,
- I do.

1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:10.120
- Has he told you that he
lost his $40 million contract

1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:11.940
when he hurt himself?

1:21:11.940 --> 1:21:13.833
Hey, still love him?

1:21:15.219 --> 1:21:17.577
I bet you ain't even told
your family, did you?

1:21:21.276 --> 1:21:25.609
(clapping) The great Jonas Johnson.

1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:30.860
How does it feel to be tossed aside?

1:21:30.860 --> 1:21:32.460
- Feels like I'm the same

1:21:32.460 --> 1:21:34.570
and you'll never be like
me on your best day.

1:21:34.570 --> 1:21:38.763
So, on my mama, you better
get outta here dude!

1:21:38.763 --> 1:21:43.763
- (chuckles) All right, I'll
leave, but hey, before I go.

1:21:46.910 --> 1:21:49.993
I told you I've been with a black woman.

1:21:54.530 --> 1:21:55.362
- I'm sorry.

1:21:56.219 --> 1:21:57.053
- Let's GO!

1:21:58.480 --> 1:21:59.452
- Goodbye Jasmine.

1:22:02.139 --> 1:22:03.680
No, no, no, no, no, baby, baby, it's over.

1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:04.513
They're out of our lives.

1:22:04.513 --> 1:22:07.350
They're out of our lives, all right?

1:22:07.350 --> 1:22:09.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but how are you?

1:22:09.370 --> 1:22:10.389
All right, did he hurt you?

1:22:10.389 --> 1:22:13.110
- No, I'm fine.
- Huh?

1:22:23.070 --> 1:22:24.139
- Go slow.

1:22:24.139 --> 1:22:25.897
- You okay little man?

1:22:25.897 --> 1:22:26.730
- I'm a G.

1:22:28.410 --> 1:22:32.469
- Doctor said he'll be fine,
just minor cuts and bruises.

1:22:32.469 --> 1:22:33.370
- Let me help you.

1:22:35.219 --> 1:22:36.303
You a G, huh?

1:22:37.857 --> 1:22:39.743
- Easy now, easy.

1:22:39.743 --> 1:22:41.130
I got you, all right.

1:22:41.130 --> 1:22:42.532
- You two need to talk.

1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:45.440
Now I've had my say in the matter.

1:22:45.440 --> 1:22:46.440
- Yes ma'am.

1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:48.666
- Lisa a lot's been goin' on
tonight, baby I'll fill you in.

1:22:48.666 --> 1:22:49.950
Are you still stayin' with us?

1:22:49.950 --> 1:22:52.903
- Yes ma'am, I completely understand.

1:22:54.630 --> 1:22:56.730
I'll leave you all to talk, okay?

1:22:56.730 --> 1:22:57.739
Have a good night.

1:22:57.739 --> 1:22:58.700
- Goodnight, I'll see you tomorrow.

1:22:58.700 --> 1:23:01.813
- Son, I meant what I said.

1:23:04.940 --> 1:23:05.773
I love you, son.

1:23:07.927 --> 1:23:08.817
I love you, son.

1:23:08.817 --> 1:23:10.809
- I love you too pops.

1:23:10.809 --> 1:23:13.202
- Hey pops, what about
that three second rule?

1:23:17.010 --> 1:23:20.763
- That rule no longer
applies to either of my boys,

1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:24.007
come here, now.

1:23:32.580 --> 1:23:36.870
Flo, I've got something that
I need to go and handle.

1:23:36.870 --> 1:23:37.702
- Johnny...

1:23:37.702 --> 1:23:39.103
- But, I will be back shortly.

1:23:41.130 --> 1:23:43.960
Goodnight everybody.
- Johnny, please, please,

1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:45.013

1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:49.741
- Hey I'm goin' wit' you pops.
- Oh my God.

1:23:49.741 --> 1:23:51.080
- Goodnight fellas.
- All right now.

1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:51.937
- Oh God, please.

1:23:51.937 --> 1:23:53.207
Jesus, please, please.
- Ay pops, can you change

1:23:53.207 --> 1:23:54.040
your shirt?

1:23:54.040 --> 1:23:55.106
Can't go in the hood with this shirt on.

1:23:55.106 --> 1:23:56.693
- Flo, it's goin' be all right Flo.

1:23:56.693 --> 1:23:58.960
Flo, it's goin' be all right.
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1:23:59.927 --> 1:24:02.580
- Derek, you need anything, baby?

1:24:02.580 --> 1:24:04.490
- No, Auntie, I'm fine.

1:24:04.490 --> 1:24:06.796
- Are you sure there? Looka there. Jesus.

1:24:06.796 --> 1:24:07.860
- I'm gonna go to bed, actually.

1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:10.882
- Baby, you got to be
more careful, look here.

1:24:10.882 --> 1:24:11.715
- I got it, I got it.

1:24:12.642 --> 1:24:14.000
- You good? Um.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.320
- Sure you're okay?

1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.153
- I am Charlie.

1:24:17.070 --> 1:24:18.559
- Let me help him a little bit.

1:24:18.559 --> 1:24:20.280
Lord baby, obviously...

1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:21.730
- You guys have a good night.

1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:31.380
- Get some rest now, go
ahead, go in your room.

1:24:31.380 --> 1:24:36.380
Don't come back down. Jesus,
um, um, um, um. I tell ya.

1:24:39.349 --> 1:24:40.766
Charlie, come on.

1:24:42.416 --> 1:24:43.250
(whispering) Come on up here.

1:24:43.250 --> 1:24:44.719
- Oh yeah, it's gettin' late!

1:24:44.719 --> 1:24:47.380
- Yes it is, it's gettin very late.

1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:48.740
- I better go too.

1:24:48.740 --> 1:24:51.180
- You call, go ahead now.

1:24:51.180 --> 1:24:53.219
Go ahead Charlie, I'll see you tomorrow.

1:24:53.219 --> 1:24:54.340
- See y'all later.

1:24:54.340 --> 1:24:59.107
- Come on Charlie, shhhh,

1:25:00.277 --> 1:25:02.057
Get you some (indistinct).

1:25:02.057 --> 1:25:05.307
(Hip hop music begins)

1:25:20.626 --> 1:25:23.293
(knock on door)

1:25:24.178 --> 1:25:25.011
- Door like this?

1:25:25.011 --> 1:25:26.588
- Man, what the...
- Who's this?

1:25:26.588 --> 1:25:28.090
(knock on door)

1:25:28.090 --> 1:25:29.257
- Who is that?

1:25:32.110 --> 1:25:33.233
- Stand down.

1:25:38.709 --> 1:25:41.170
What's up wit you two? We cool?

1:25:41.170 --> 1:25:43.040
- That's yet to be determined,

1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:44.760
- I think you know why we're here, right?

1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:46.400
Y'all jumped my little brother.

1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:48.160
- (laughing)

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:49.853
- Oh, that's funny to you, huh?

1:25:52.544 --> 1:25:54.553
- Well, if it ain't Mr. NFL himself.

1:25:55.627 --> 1:25:58.130
You two got some heart comin' in here.

1:25:58.130 --> 1:26:00.130
I could blow your brains out right here!

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:03.250
- Boy, you don't scare me.

1:26:03.250 --> 1:26:04.969
Now, I know your daddy.

1:26:04.969 --> 1:26:07.080
We was boys before he went off to prison

1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:09.290
to serve a life sentence.

1:26:09.290 --> 1:26:13.300
Now, you can shoot me, but what
is that going to accomplish?

1:26:13.300 --> 1:26:15.851
You wanna die in prison like your father?

1:26:15.851 --> 1:26:16.684
- (chuckles).

1:26:16.684 --> 1:26:18.850
- Now, I know why you're angry, son.

1:26:18.850 --> 1:26:20.450
I know why all of you are angry,

1:26:21.570 --> 1:26:25.963
but you can't let the sins
of your father become yours!

1:26:27.712 --> 1:26:29.097
- Don't come in here actin'
like you understand us

1:26:29.097 --> 1:26:32.323
or better than us, especially you Mr. NFL!

1:26:36.930 --> 1:26:38.690
I should just blow your head off!

1:26:38.690 --> 1:26:40.290
You don't care nothin' about us.

1:26:40.290 --> 1:26:41.867
You donate some tennis
shoes around Christmas.

1:26:41.867 --> 1:26:44.700
and you think that makes it right?

1:26:49.690 --> 1:26:50.930
- Now, wait a minute, boy,
I'm not goin' just let you...

1:26:50.930 --> 1:26:54.233
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
it's okay, pops. I got it.

1:26:59.350 --> 1:27:02.710
Yeah, you goin' shoot me, Boog? Hmm?

1:27:02.710 --> 1:27:03.830
Pull the trigger,

1:27:03.830 --> 1:27:06.303
'cause I ain't afraid to
die what I believe in.

1:27:07.455 --> 1:27:08.600
- What you believe in!?
- Yeah.

1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:10.670
- And, what you believe in, huh?

1:27:10.670 --> 1:27:11.690
- My family...

1:27:14.210 --> 1:27:18.817
and you, Boog, yeah and everybody in here

1:27:19.857 --> 1:27:24.833
and I believe, we stop killin'
each other and work together.

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:31.270
We can make things happen,
man. That's what I believe.

1:27:31.270 --> 1:27:32.280
- How are we goin' to do that!?

1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.430
- First by you takin'
that gun out by head.

1:27:37.090 --> 1:27:39.823
And let's chop it up, I got you.

1:27:44.860 --> 1:27:46.559
- We don't need no empty promises.

1:27:47.410 --> 1:27:49.230
That's all people ever done is lied to us.

1:27:49.230 --> 1:27:51.910
- Ay, it's me, you got my word

1:27:51.910 --> 1:27:53.059
and I'ma listen to you.

1:27:54.323 --> 1:27:55.690
Now, tell me what we need.

1:27:55.690 --> 1:27:59.323
I wanna change this world,
let's start wit' our hood.

1:27:59.323 --> 1:28:00.313
What we need?

1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:05.993
- We'll see, we'll chop it up.

1:28:05.993 --> 1:28:07.400
- All right, that's my word.

1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:08.233
- All right.

1:28:10.175 --> 1:28:12.143
- Aight, let's go pops.

1:28:20.090 --> 1:28:23.173
(upbeat music plays)

1:28:47.375 --> 1:28:50.107
- Charlie, now I'm not a loose woman,

1:28:50.107 --> 1:28:53.139
but I am havin' a loose moment.

1:28:53.139 --> 1:28:56.111
- Well, I'm goin' do my
best to break yo back!

1:28:56.111 --> 1:28:57.645
- Oooohhhh oooohhh ooohhh
- (laughing).

1:28:57.645 --> 1:28:59.967
- Now my back been broke, years ago!

1:29:10.590 --> 1:29:12.630
- So you...
- So you...

1:29:12.630 --> 1:29:14.580
- come on, sit down, you go first babe.

1:29:16.300 --> 1:29:17.133
Just relax.

1:29:25.910 --> 1:29:28.139
- Why didn't you come for me?

1:29:29.993 --> 1:29:32.862
I know I made it virtually
impossible for you to find me,

1:29:34.004 --> 1:29:36.154
but I believe that love
always finds a way.

1:29:38.889 --> 1:29:40.903
- We found each other now, right?

1:29:42.303 --> 1:29:44.160
'Cause we're here right now

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:45.410
and if any constellation,

1:29:46.559 --> 1:29:48.373
Lisa I thought about you every day.

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:50.920
It was just my foolish pride

1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:52.820
that stopped me from coming after you.

1:29:54.630 --> 1:29:56.180
- You're engaged to be married.

1:29:57.171 --> 1:29:59.230
- Yeah, well, Aunt B was right,

1:29:59.230 --> 1:30:00.663
Jasmine never had my heart,

1:30:01.600 --> 1:30:04.563
I mean, truth be told no one
can ever take your place.

1:30:08.490 --> 1:30:10.320
- I don't know if my heart...

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:12.210
risk being broken.

1:30:12.210 --> 1:30:13.043
- Mine either.

1:30:14.130 --> 1:30:16.660
Lisa I was devastated when you left,

1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:18.600
but what remained constant.

1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:19.723
Was my love for you.

1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:23.103
Woman, I love you more than I ever have.

1:30:25.469 --> 1:30:27.570
I'm mature enough now to
deal with my feelings,

1:30:27.570 --> 1:30:28.583
I wasn't back then.

1:30:34.540 --> 1:30:35.623
- I'm scared.

1:30:36.718 --> 1:30:37.678
- I know.

1:30:37.678 --> 1:30:40.511
(R&B music plays)

1:31:23.977 --> 1:31:25.227
- Go from here?

1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:31.263
- Let's figure it out another day.

1:31:35.300 --> 1:31:36.889
What I need to know...

1:31:36.889 --> 1:31:39.045
- I'm (indistinct) (chuckles).

1:31:39.045 --> 1:31:41.878
(R&B music plays)

1:31:57.370 --> 1:31:59.370
- And what's it come to?

1:31:59.370 --> 1:32:01.678
A hot glorified mess.

1:32:01.678 --> 1:32:04.910
Son, you hurt me when you
said we embarrassed you.

1:32:04.910 --> 1:32:07.910
We sacrificed everything so
that you could be where you are.

1:32:10.050 --> 1:32:10.883
- You did, ma.

1:32:12.249 --> 1:32:14.889
- But you don't want
nobody that looks like me.

1:32:14.889 --> 1:32:17.362
Son, just who am I to you?

1:32:18.361 --> 1:32:21.420
- Ma, I wasn't sayin' that about you, ma.

1:32:21.420 --> 1:32:22.420
- You don't have to.

1:32:23.428 --> 1:32:24.844
Your actions did.

1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:44.300
- Good morning, ma.

1:32:44.350 --> 1:32:47.483
- Morning son, you're up mighty early.

1:32:50.840 --> 1:32:55.020
- I wanna apologize

1:32:56.665 --> 1:32:57.777
for not being here

1:32:59.663 --> 1:33:02.023
and the way I treated
you throughout the years.

1:33:06.350 --> 1:33:07.600
Ma, look at me.

1:33:12.462 --> 1:33:13.295
Ma.

1:33:16.093 --> 1:33:18.143
I wish you would've told me you was sick.

1:33:21.014 --> 1:33:22.615
- I didn't wanna worry you, son.

1:33:34.860 --> 1:33:36.317
- She reminded me of you.

1:33:40.130 --> 1:33:42.463
- Who are you talkin' about?

1:33:44.150 --> 1:33:45.383
- A long time ago,

1:33:47.150 --> 1:33:49.573
I did choose a woman just like you,

1:33:52.780 --> 1:33:57.323
Lisa, but she hurt me, ma.

1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:03.630
Yeah, Lisa

1:34:05.969 --> 1:34:08.257
has every quality I love about you.

1:34:13.486 --> 1:34:15.903
- I knew she is a good woman.

1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:20.303
- So it wasn't you, it was Lisa.

1:34:22.905 --> 1:34:27.905
(indistinct), you, reminded
me of everything about Lisa

1:34:27.910 --> 1:34:29.200
that was familiar to us

1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:33.683
and that hurt.

1:34:36.110 --> 1:34:37.889
That's why I didn't stay.

1:34:42.687 --> 1:34:44.187
But I never meant to hurt you.

1:34:47.260 --> 1:34:48.093
- I know, son.

1:34:49.838 --> 1:34:52.433
I want you to know I'm proud of you.

1:34:54.391 --> 1:34:56.558
My baby is back.

1:34:56.558 --> 1:34:58.463
- (chuckles) Yes I am.

1:35:00.469 --> 1:35:01.373
Yes I am.

1:35:04.420 --> 1:35:07.153
You, I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:11.097
- You still the most beautiful
woman in the world to me.

1:35:11.097 --> 1:35:13.294
- I know (chuckling).

1:35:13.294 --> 1:35:15.020
So come on, help me make these pancakes

1:35:15.020 --> 1:35:16.530
like we did back in the day.

1:35:16.530 --> 1:35:18.260
- Sure, if only you're making your famous

1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:19.588
blueberry pancakes.

1:35:19.588 --> 1:35:22.389
- You better know it honey,
that's you and Derek's favorite.

1:35:22.389 --> 1:35:23.822
- Yeah.

1:35:23.822 --> 1:35:25.401
- All right?
- All right.

1:35:25.401 --> 1:35:27.843
- Start off with some flour
and sugar and baking powder.

1:35:36.940 --> 1:35:39.357
- Woman, don't start nothin'!

1:35:40.234 --> 1:35:41.844
Only brought one pill with me.

1:35:41.844 --> 1:35:44.374
- (whispering) Oh, I got
a stash (indistinct).

1:35:44.374 --> 1:35:45.707
- What?
- (chuckling).

1:35:45.707 --> 1:35:47.180
- Shhhh.

1:35:47.180 --> 1:35:48.013
- Shhhh.

1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:52.517
(whispering)

1:35:59.476 --> 1:36:00.710
- (clears throat)

1:36:00.710 --> 1:36:02.757
- Heyyyy! Charlie!
- Hey!

1:36:02.757 --> 1:36:05.740
Hey, look at Charlie, Charlie, hey,

- Uh huh.
- Look at Charlie stoppin in

1:36:09.250 --> 1:36:10.083
today.

1:36:10.083 --> 1:36:12.290
So early to visit us, look at Charlie.

1:36:12.290 --> 1:36:13.503
- You up early.

I just came by to, you know,
take Barb to breakfast.

1:36:15.818 --> 1:36:17.215

So, Barb, Barbara,

1:36:19.252 --> 1:36:23.710

1:36:23.710 --> 1:36:26.190
- Yeah, uh huh, of course, you
ain't heard of the new place

1:36:26.190 --> 1:36:27.600
called the Pajama House?

1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:28.860
- The Pajama House?

1:36:28.860 --> 1:36:30.600

Well, church ain't the only place

1:36:36.290 --> 1:36:38.010
where you can just come as you are.

1:36:38.010 --> 1:36:39.530
Okay?
- Yeah.

1:36:39.530 --> 1:36:41.580
- Okay, I see.

Well Charlie, why don't you

1:36:44.830 --> 1:36:45.850
Pancakes...

1:36:47.170 --> 1:36:48.775

1:36:48.775 --> 1:36:49.618
I'm stayin'.

1:36:49.618 --> 1:36:50.509
(laughter at once)

1:36:50.509 --> 1:36:55.189
- All right, come on, let's eat.

1:36:55.189 --> 1:37:00.189
- Whew.

1:37:05.351 --> 1:37:09.809

Christmas, let your heart be... ♪

1:37:09.809 --> 1:37:10.980
- Charlie!?

1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:14.530
You left yo glasses in
the bathroom last night.

1:37:14.530 --> 1:37:16.880
Now, how in the world did you drive home

1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:18.920
without these glasses?

1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:20.410
You got cataracts Charlie.

1:37:20.410 --> 1:37:22.351
- It was hard, but I made it.

1:37:22.351 --> 1:37:23.193
(all chuckles)

1:37:23.193 --> 1:37:24.398
- Uh huh, uh huh.

1:37:27.463 --> 1:37:28.719
- Mr. Charlie, I apologize,

1:37:28.719 --> 1:37:30.780
but my rental blocked you in last night.

1:37:30.780 --> 1:37:31.612
- Yeah.

1:37:33.046 --> 1:37:33.963
- Hmmm, um!

1:37:36.407 --> 1:37:38.690
- All right, all right.

1:37:38.690 --> 1:37:40.843
He slept with me last night in my room.

1:37:43.340 --> 1:37:45.003
Look, we grown, shoot.

1:37:46.370 --> 1:37:47.910
- Girl, we just messin' with you.

1:37:47.910 --> 1:37:50.190
I looked in on you last
night and saw him sleeping

1:37:50.190 --> 1:37:51.090
on the couch.

1:37:51.090 --> 1:37:52.830
- But I'll bet you he got in that bed

1:37:52.830 --> 1:37:54.650
later on (laughing).

1:37:54.650 --> 1:37:55.708
You know I did.

1:37:55.708 --> 1:37:56.800
(laughter at once)

1:37:56.800 --> 1:37:57.633

1:38:01.873 --> 1:38:02.903
- Ah, I didn't know you
were leavin' this soon.

1:38:02.903 --> 1:38:04.780
- I know, I forgot to
mention it last night,

1:38:04.780 --> 1:38:06.827
but one of my clients has an emergency.

1:38:07.817 --> 1:38:09.040
- Aight.

1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:11.233
- Seems that a lot happened last night.

1:38:13.170 --> 1:38:15.098
You care to share.

1:38:15.098 --> 1:38:16.762
- It's a long story pop...

1:38:16.762 --> 1:38:18.710
- Did we miss somethin'?

1:38:18.710 --> 1:38:22.160
- Let's just say, we seized the moment.

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:25.253
- Oooohhh baby, you go 'head
and help yoself (laughing)!

1:38:25.253 --> 1:38:27.290

1:38:32.090 --> 1:38:32.923
Thank you pops.

1:38:36.580 --> 1:38:38.980

1:38:40.550 --> 1:38:44.437
Yeah, baby don't go so soon,

1:38:47.846 --> 1:38:49.090
We just got you back.

1:38:49.090 --> 1:38:52.003
- I know, but I promised I'd
be back before New Year's Eve.

1:38:53.541 --> 1:38:54.778
Are you okay?

1:38:54.778 --> 1:38:57.413
- No, 'cause I can't bear the thought

1:38:57.413 --> 1:38:59.663
of being without you again.

1:39:02.303 --> 1:39:03.323
That hurt.

1:39:08.830 --> 1:39:11.340
Too many years have gone
by without me seeing your

1:39:11.340 --> 1:39:14.480
pretty smile, pretty two brown eyes.

1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:17.063
- (chuckling).

1:39:18.190 --> 1:39:20.040
- Look, I don't wanna lose you again.

1:39:20.912 --> 1:39:22.883
- You won't, I promise.

1:39:25.830 --> 1:39:27.010
You can do one-

1:39:31.482 --> 1:39:32.950
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:39:32.950 --> 1:39:34.960
Just tryin' to work on my nerves, just...

1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.513
- That's what's up, bro! Yeahhhh, boy!

1:39:40.630 --> 1:39:41.463
- Come on...

1:39:42.808 --> 1:39:43.758
y'all stop, please.

1:39:45.816 --> 1:39:46.648
Okay.

1:39:46.648 --> 1:39:47.482
- What are you doing?

1:39:47.482 --> 1:39:49.563
- Somethin' I should've
done a long time ago.

1:39:52.937 --> 1:39:55.963
Okay, look, I let you
get away from me once.

1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.183
I can't let that happen again.

1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:02.246
Every time I look at you,

1:40:03.541 --> 1:40:05.653
I'm reminded how much God loves me.

1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:09.193
He brought you back to me.

1:40:09.193 --> 1:40:10.443
- I believe so.

1:40:11.889 --> 1:40:14.743
- I want you wit' me all the time.

1:40:14.743 --> 1:40:18.313
Lisa, I've never loved anything
as much as I love you now.

1:40:20.181 --> 1:40:21.014
Now look, I don't have a ring.

1:40:21.014 --> 1:40:23.043
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:40:23.980 --> 1:40:24.940
We can fix that.

1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:26.800
- Ooohhhh.
- Babe, where is it?

1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:27.940
- Hold on, son.

1:40:30.350 --> 1:40:31.183
Hold on, son.

1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:41.800
This is for you.

1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:56.323
This is the string ring
I gave your mother.

1:41:01.590 --> 1:41:03.053
- So the story is true, pops?

1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:07.760
- Yes, I just didn't
wanna look like a punk

1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:09.160
at the card game (laughing).

1:41:11.630 --> 1:41:12.773
- That's deep, pops.

1:41:13.712 --> 1:41:14.545
Thank you,

1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:25.150
- Lisa Marie (indistinct),
will you do the honor

1:41:26.045 --> 1:41:29.593
of spendin' the rest of your
life wit' me and be my wife?

1:41:33.530 --> 1:41:34.362
- On one condition.

1:41:34.362 --> 1:41:35.532
- On one condition?

1:41:37.181 --> 1:41:40.202
- Promise that we'll always
keep God the center of us.

1:41:42.070 --> 1:41:44.623
- I promise, God will
always be the center.

1:41:46.070 --> 1:41:49.139
- Yes, Jonas Johnson, I will marry you!

1:41:49.139 --> 1:41:52.139
(family celebrates)

1:41:55.752 --> 1:41:57.585
- Congratulations boy!

1:41:59.037 --> 1:42:04.037
(muah) (chuckling) Smells like Infamil.

1:42:06.664 --> 1:42:11.246
(family watches in awe and excitement)

1:42:12.530 --> 1:42:13.730
- That's what's up, bro!

1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:16.073
- Get a room.

1:42:19.645 --> 1:42:21.860
(clapping)

1:42:21.860 --> 1:42:23.660
- You know what? Should we tell 'em?

1:42:27.370 --> 1:42:28.520
- Tell us what Charlie?

1:42:34.090 --> 1:42:38.120
- Well, you know, since
everybody's sharing

1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:39.653
and love is in the air.

1:42:40.732 --> 1:42:41.948
I figured, I wanna share somethin' too.

1:42:41.948 --> 1:42:42.781
- (chuckles) Help me up baby.

1:42:42.781 --> 1:42:43.853
- Come on, baby.

1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:45.873
Jesus Christ.

1:42:46.769 --> 1:42:48.469
- (indistinct) three should do it.

1:42:51.490 --> 1:42:52.530
- That took all day.

1:42:52.530 --> 1:42:55.000
What is it that you
wanna tell us, Charlie!?

1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:58.090

We want y'all to be there.

1:43:07.708 --> 1:43:09.670
- All right, big dog.

1:43:09.670 --> 1:43:10.705
- Thank you, thank you.

1:43:10.705 --> 1:43:12.657
- (chuckling) Hopefully,
I don't kill this one.

1:43:16.020 --> 1:43:19.045
Y'all know I'm kiddin', he's a keeper.

1:43:19.045 --> 1:43:20.529
- (indistinct).

1:43:20.529 --> 1:43:21.670
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1:43:21.670 --> 1:43:23.980
Yes! This is it.

1:43:23.980 --> 1:43:25.820
She's finally moving!

1:43:25.820 --> 1:43:30.360
No more wet wigs in the bathroom.
No more bad breath jokes.

1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:34.410
No more aroma of Bengay
throughout this house.

1:43:34.410 --> 1:43:38.100
She's finally moving out,
Flo, who's the matchmaker now?

1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:39.230
Huh?
- (laughing).

1:43:39.230 --> 1:43:42.230
- The wicked witch of
the west is finally gone.

1:43:42.230 --> 1:43:45.350
She's finally movin' out. This right here,

1:43:45.350 --> 1:43:47.700
is a perfect moment for a praise break!

1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:50.436
Come on!
(gospel music begins)

1:43:50.436 --> 1:43:53.073
- Go 'head pops, go 'head.

1:43:53.073 --> 1:43:54.073
- Hey, heyyy! HEY!!!

1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:58.299
Who's the matchmaker now, Flo?

1:43:58.299 --> 1:44:01.559
- Awww, what are you

1:44:01.559 --> 1:44:03.670
- Talkin' about you

1:44:03.670 --> 1:44:05.180
- I ain't going nowhere.

1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:07.450
- (chuckles) We ain't going nowhere.

1:44:07.450 --> 1:44:08.282
- Right.

1:44:08.282 --> 1:44:09.700

1:44:11.036 --> 1:44:12.670

1:44:20.891 --> 1:44:23.010
(laughing).
- 'Cause my sister Flo told me

1:44:23.010 --> 1:44:26.017

1:44:26.017 --> 1:44:28.490

1:44:28.490 --> 1:44:30.342

1:44:30.342 --> 1:44:31.175
(laughter at once)

1:44:31.175 --> 1:44:34.342
(gospel music begins)

1:44:39.610 --> 1:44:42.230
- Well, I guess that one
backfired (laughing).

1:44:42.230 --> 1:44:44.300
- Well, I guess it did, yeah, yeah,

1:44:44.300 --> 1:44:49.300
well, at least we now have
two social security checks

1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:51.680

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:55.077

Two and two (laughing).

1:44:57.246 --> 1:44:59.700

(family digests info at once)

1:45:11.660 --> 1:45:14.740
- Wow, that's good,

1:46:08.270 --> 1:46:10.735
and tell him I'm not leaving, I'm staying.

1:46:10.735 --> 1:46:11.568

1:46:11.568 --> 1:46:13.160
(laughter at once)

1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:16.163

1:50:49.700 --> 1:50:52.100
- My prayer was answered.

1:50:52.100 --> 1:50:55.460
My son is back with the love of his life

1:50:55.460 --> 1:50:58.430
and reconnected with his family.

1:50:58.430 --> 1:51:02.219
Sometimes, a mama knows
what's best for her children,

1:51:02.219 --> 1:51:05.706
especially a praying mama.

1:51:05.706 --> 1:51:08.073
Ain't nothin' like family.

1:51:28.170 --> 1:51:30.407

1:51:30.407 --> 1:51:32.945

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:52.833
- Love is definitely in the air.

1:51:53.842 --> 1:51:55.530
I guess if you think about it,

1:51:55.530 --> 1:51:59.080
I caused all of this marital
bliss in the first place.

1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:02.030
Yeah, who's the matchmaker?

1:52:02.030 --> 1:52:05.360
